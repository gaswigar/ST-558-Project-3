and
the
online
distributed
proofreading
team
and
chartres
by
henry
adams
with
an
introduction
by
ralph
adams
cram
editor
note
from
the
moment
when
through
the
courtesy
of
my
friend
barrett
wendell
i
came
first
to
know
henry
adams
book
michel
and
chartres
i
was
profoundly
convinced
that
this
privately
printed
jealously
guarded
volume
should
be
withdrawn
from
its
amongst
the
bibliographical
treasures
of
collectors
and
amateurs
and
given
that
wide
publicity
demanded
alike
by
its
intrinsic
nature
and
the
cause
it
could
so
admirably
serve
to
say
that
the
book
was
a
revelation
is
inadequately
to
express
a
fact
at
once
all
the
theology
philosophy
and
mysticism
the
politics
sociology
and
economics
the
romance
literature
and
art
of
that
greatest
epoch
of
christian
civilization
became
fused
in
the
alembic
of
an
unique
insight
and
precipitated
by
the
dynamic
force
of
a
personal
and
distinguished
style
a
judgment
that
might
well
have
been
biased
by
personal
inclination
received
the
endorsement
of
many
in
two
continents
more
competent
to
pass
judgment
better
able
to
speak
with
authority
and
so
fortified
i
had
the
honour
of
saying
to
adams
in
the
autumn
of
that
the
american
institute
of
architects
asked
the
distinguished
privilege
of
arranging
for
the
publication
of
an
edition
for
general
sale
under
its
own
imprimatur
the
result
is
the
volume
now
made
available
for
public
circulation
in
justice
to
adams
it
should
be
said
that
such
publication
is
in
his
opinion
unnecessary
and
a
conclusion
in
which
neither
the
american
institute
of
architects
the
publishers
nor
the
editor
concurs
furthermore
the
form
in
which
the
book
is
presented
is
no
affair
of
the
author
who
in
giving
reluctant
consent
to
publication
expressly
stipulated
that
he
should
have
no
part
or
parcel
in
carrying
out
so
mad
a
venture
of
faith
as
he
estimated
the
project
of
giving
his
book
to
the
public
in
this
and
for
once
his
judgment
is
at
fault
and
chartres
is
one
of
the
most
distinguished
contributions
to
literature
and
one
of
the
most
valuable
adjuncts
to
the
study
of
mediaevalism
america
thus
far
has
produced
the
rediscovery
of
this
great
epoch
of
christian
civilization
has
had
issue
in
many
and
valuable
works
on
its
religion
its
philosophy
its
economics
its
politics
and
its
art
but
in
nearly
every
instance
whichever
field
has
been
traversed
has
been
considered
almost
as
an
isolated
phenomenon
with
insufficient
reference
to
the
other
aspects
of
an
era
that
was
singularly
united
and
at
one
with
itself
hugh
of
saint
victor
and
saint
thomas
aquinas
are
fully
comprehensible
only
in
their
relationship
to
saint
anselm
saint
bernard
and
the
development
of
catholic
dogma
and
life
feudalism
the
crusades
the
guilds
and
communes
weave
themselves
into
this
same
religious
development
and
into
the
vicissitudes
of
crescent
nationalities
dante
the
cathedral
builders
the
painters
sculptors
and
music
masters
all
are
closely
knit
into
the
warp
and
woof
of
philosophy
statecraft
economics
and
religious
devotion
indeed
it
may
be
said
that
the
middle
ages
more
than
any
other
recorded
epoch
of
history
must
be
considered
en
bloc
as
a
period
of
consistent
unity
as
highly
emphasized
as
was
its
dynamic
force
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
that
adams
deals
with
the
art
of
the
middle
ages
after
this
fashion
he
is
not
of
those
who
would
determine
every
element
in
art
from
its
material
antecedents
he
realizes
very
fully
that
its
essential
element
the
thing
that
differentiates
it
from
the
art
that
preceded
and
that
which
followed
is
its
spiritual
impulse
the
manifestation
may
have
been
and
probably
was
more
or
less
accidental
but
that
which
makes
chartres
cathedral
and
its
glass
the
sculptures
of
rheims
the
dies
irae
aucassin
and
nicolette
the
song
of
roland
the
arthurian
legends
great
art
and
unique
is
neither
their
technical
mastery
nor
their
fidelity
to
the
enduring
laws
of
all
great
art
though
these
are
singular
in
their
perfection
but
rather
the
peculiar
spiritual
impulse
which
informed
the
time
and
by
its
intensity
its
penetrating
power
and
its
dynamic
force
wrought
a
rounded
and
complete
civilization
and
manifested
this
through
a
thousand
varied
channels
greater
perhaps
even
than
his
grasp
of
the
singular
entirety
of
mediaeval
civilization
is
adams
power
of
merging
himself
in
a
long
dead
time
of
thinking
and
feeling
with
the
men
and
women
thereof
and
so
breathing
on
the
dead
bones
of
antiquity
that
again
they
clothe
themselves
with
flesh
and
vesture
call
back
their
severed
souls
and
live
again
not
only
to
the
consciousness
of
the
reader
but
before
his
very
eyes
and
it
is
not
a
thin
simulacrum
he
raises
by
some
doubtful
alchemy
it
is
no
phantasm
of
the
past
that
shines
dimly
before
us
in
these
magical
pages
it
is
the
very
time
itself
in
which
we
are
merged
we
forgather
with
the
abbot
and
his
monks
and
the
crusaders
and
pilgrims
in
the
shrine
of
the
archangel
we
pay
our
devoirs
to
the
fair
french
queens
blanche
of
castile
eleanor
of
aquitaine
mary
of
champagne
fighting
their
battles
for
them
as
liege
servants
we
dispute
with
abelard
thomas
of
aquino
duns
the
scotsman
we
take
our
parts
in
the
court
of
love
or
sing
the
sublime
and
sounding
praises
of
god
with
the
canons
of
saint
victor
our
eyes
opened
at
last
and
after
many
days
we
kneel
before
our
lady
of
pity
asking
her
intercession
for
her
lax
but
loyal
devotees
seven
centuries
dissolve
and
vanish
away
being
as
they
were
not
and
the
thirteenth
century
lives
less
for
us
than
we
live
in
it
and
are
a
part
of
its
gaiety
and
heartedness
its
youthful
ardour
and
abounding
action
its
childlike
simplicity
and
frankness
its
normal
and
healthy
and
devotion
and
it
is
well
for
us
to
have
this
experience
apart
from
the
desirable
transformation
it
effects
in
preconceived
and
curiously
erroneous
superstitions
as
to
one
of
the
greatest
eras
in
all
history
it
is
vastly
heartening
and
exhilarating
if
it
gives
new
and
not
always
flattering
standards
for
the
judgment
of
contemporary
men
and
things
so
does
it
establish
new
ideals
new
goals
for
attainment
to
live
for
a
day
in
a
world
that
built
chartres
cathedral
even
if
it
makes
the
living
in
a
world
that
creates
the
black
country
of
england
or
an
iron
city
of
america
less
a
thing
of
joy
and
gladness
than
before
equally
opens
up
the
far
prospect
of
another
thirteenth
century
in
the
times
that
are
to
come
and
urges
to
ardent
action
toward
its
attainment
but
apart
from
this
the
deepest
value
of
and
chartres
its
importance
as
a
revelation
of
the
eternal
glory
of
mediaeval
art
and
the
elements
that
brought
it
into
being
is
not
lightly
to
be
expressed
to
every
artist
whatever
his
chosen
form
of
expression
it
must
appear
unique
and
invaluable
and
to
none
more
than
the
architect
who
familiar
at
last
with
its
beauties
its
power
and
its
teaching
force
can
only
applaud
the
action
of
the
american
institute
of
architects
in
making
adams
an
honorary
member
as
one
who
has
rendered
distinguished
services
to
the
art
and
voice
his
gratitude
that
it
has
brought
the
book
within
his
reach
and
given
it
publicity
before
the
world

preface
december
some
old
elizabethan
play
or
poem
contains
the
lines
who
reads
me
when
i
am
ashes
is
my
son
in
wishes
the
relationship
between
reader
and
writer
of
son
and
father
may
have
existed
in
queen
elizabeth
time
but
is
much
too
close
to
be
true
for
ours
the
utmost
that
any
writer
could
hope
of
his
readers
now
is
that
they
should
consent
to
regard
themselves
as
nephews
and
even
then
he
would
expect
only
a
more
or
less
civil
refusal
from
most
of
them
indeed
if
he
had
reached
a
certain
age
he
would
have
observed
that
nephews
as
a
social
class
no
longer
read
at
all
and
that
there
is
only
one
familiar
instance
recorded
of
a
nephew
who
read
his
uncle
the
exception
tends
rather
to
support
the
rule
since
it
needed
a
macaulay
to
produce
and
two
volumes
to
record
it
finally
the
metre
does
not
permit
it
one
may
not
say
who
reads
me
when
i
am
ashes
is
my
nephew
in
wishes
the
same
objections
do
not
apply
to
the
word
niece
the
change
restores
the
verse
and
to
a
very
great
degree
the
fact
nieces
have
been
known
to
read
in
early
youth
and
in
some
cases
may
have
read
their
uncles
the
relationship
too
is
convenient
and
easy
capable
of
being
anything
or
nothing
at
the
will
of
either
party
like
a
mohammedan
or
polynesian
or
american
marriage
no
valid
objection
can
be
offered
to
this
choice
in
the
verse
niece
let
it
be
the
following
lines
then
are
written
for
nieces
or
for
those
who
are
willing
for
those
to
be
nieces
in
wish
for
convenience
of
travel
in
france
where
hotels
in
places
are
sometimes
wanting
in
space
as
well
as
luxury
the
nieces
shall
count
as
one
only
as
many
more
may
come
as
like
but
one
niece
is
enough
for
the
uncle
to
talk
to
and
one
niece
is
much
more
likely
than
two
to
listen
one
niece
is
also
more
likely
than
two
to
carry
a
kodak
and
take
interest
in
it
since
she
has
nothing
else
except
her
uncle
to
interest
her
and
instances
occur
when
she
takes
interest
neither
in
the
uncle
nor
in
the
journey
one
can
not
assume
even
in
a
niece
too
emotional
a
nature
but
one
may
assume
a
kodak
the
party
then
with
such
variations
of
detail
as
may
suit
its
tastes
has
sailed
from
new
york
let
us
say
early
in
june
for
an
entire
summer
in
france
one
pleasant
june
morning
it
has
landed
at
cherbourg
or

and
takes
the
train
across
normandy
to
pontorson
where
with
the
evening

the
tourists
drive
along

saint

held
a
place
of
his
own
in

and
on

which
seems
in
the
eleventh
century
to
leave
hardly
room
for
the
virgin
of
the
crypt
at
chartres
still
less
for
the
beau
christ
of
the
thirteenth
century
at
amiens
the
archangel
stands
for

and
state
and
both
militant
he
is

conqueror
of

the
mightiest
of
all
created
spirits
the
nearest
to

his
place
was
where
the
danger
was
greatest
therefore
you
find
him
here
for
the
same
reason
he
was
while
the
pagan
danger
lasted
the
patron
saint
of
france
so
the
normans
when
they
were
converted
to
christianity
put
themselves
under
his
powerful
protection
so
he
stood
for
centuries
on
his
mount
in
peril

the

which

went

to

so
the
common
people
followed
and
still
follow
like
ourselves
the
church
stands
high
on
the
summit
of
this
granite
rock
and
on
its
west
front
is
the
platform
to
which
the
tourist
ought
first
to
climb
from
the
edge
of
this
platform
the
eye
plunges
down
two
hundred
and
feet
to
the
wide
sands
or
the
wider
ocean
as
the
tides
recede
or
advance
under
an
infinite
sky
over
a
restless
sea
which
even
we
tourists
can
understand
and
feel
without
books
or
guides
but
when
we
turn
from
the
western
view
and
look
at
the
church
door
thirty
or
forty
yards
from
the
parapet
where
we
stand
one
needs
to
be
eight
centuries
old
to
know
what
this
mass
of
encrusted
architecture
meant
to
its
builders
and
even
then
one
must
still
learn
to
feel
it
the
man
who
wanders
into
the
twelfth
century
is
lost
unless
he
can
grow
prematurely
young
one
can
do
it
as
one
can
play
with
children
wordsworth
whose
practical
sense
equalled
his
intuitive
genius
carefully
limited
us
to
a
season
of
calm
weather
which
is
certainly
best
but
granting
a
fair
frame
of
mind
one
can
still
have
sight
of
that
immortal
sea
which
brought
us
hither
from
the
twelfth
century
one
can
even
travel
thither
and
see
the
children
sporting
on
the
shore
our
sense
is
partially
atrophied
from
disuse
but
it
is
still
alive
at
least
in
old
people
who
alone
as
a
class
have
the
time
to
be
young
one
needs
only
to
be
old
enough
in
order
to
be
as
young
as
one
will
from
the
top
of
this
abbey
church
one
looks
across
the
bay
to
avranches
and
towards
coutances
and
the
cotentin
the
constantinus
pagus
whose
shore
facing
us
recalls
the
coast
of
new
england
the
relation
between
the
granite
of
one
coast
and
that
of
the
other
may
be
fanciful
but
the
relation
between
the
people
who
live
on
each
is
as
hard
and
practical
a
fact
as
the
granite
itself
when
one
enters
the
church
one
notes
first
the
four
great
triumphal
piers
or
columns
at
the
intersection
of
the
nave
and
transepts
and
on
looking
into
corroyer
architectural
study
which
is
the
chief
source
of
all
one
acquaintance
with
the
mount
one
learns
that
these
piers
were
constructed
in
four
out
of
five
american
tourists
will
instantly
recall
the
only
date
of
mediaeval
history
they
ever
knew
the
date
of
the
norman
conquest
eight
years
after
these
piers
were
built
in
duke
william
of
normandy
raised
an
army
of
forty
thousand
men
in
these
parts
and
in
northern
france
whom
he
took
to
england
where
they
mostly
stayed
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
until
normandy
and
england
were
united
the
norman
peasant
went
freely
to
england
with
his
lord
spiritual
or
temporal
the
norman
woman
a
very
capable
person
followed
her
husband
or
her
parents
normans
held
nearly
all
the
english
fiefs
filled
the
english
church
crowded
the
english
court
created
the
english
law
and
we
know
that
french
was
still
currently
spoken
in
england
as
late
as
or
thereabouts
after
the
scole
of
stratford
atte
bowe
the
aristocratic
norman
names
still
survive
in
part
and
if
we
look
up
their
origin
here
we
shall
generally
find
them
in
villages
so
remote
and
insignificant
that
their
place
can
hardly
be
found
on
any
ordinary
map
but
the
common
people
had
no
surnames
and
can
not
be
traced
although
for
every
noble
whose
name
or
blood
survived
in
england
or
in
normandy
we
must
reckon
hundreds
of
peasants
since
the
generation
which
followed
william
to
england
in
we
can
reckon
or
thirty
from
father
to
son
and
if
you
care
to
figure
up
the
sum
you
will
find
that
you
had
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
million
arithmetical
ancestors
living
in
the
middle
of
the
eleventh
century
the
whole
population
of
england
and
northern
france
may
then
have
numbered
five
million
but
if
it
were
fifty
it
would
not
much
affect
the
certainty
that
if
you
have
any
english
blood
at
all
you
have
also
norman
if
we
could
go
back
and
live
again
in
all
our
two
hundred
and
fifty
million
arithmetical
ancestors
of
the
eleventh
century
we
should
find
ourselves
doing
many
surprising
things
but
among
the
rest
we
should
pretty
certainly
be
ploughing
most
of
the
fields
of
the
cotentin
and
calvados
going
to
mass
in
every
parish
church
in
normandy
rendering
military
service
to
every
lord
spiritual
or
temporal
in
all
this
region
and
helping
to
build
the
abbey
church
at
from
the
roof
of
the
cathedral
of
coutances
over
yonder
one
may
look
away
over
the
hills
and
woods
the
farms
and
fields
of
normandy
and
so
familiar
so
homelike
are
they
one
can
almost
take
oath
that
in
this
or
the
other
or
in
all
one
knew
life
once
and
has
never
so
fully
known
it
since
never
so
fully
known
it
since
for
we
of
the
eleventh
century
headed
grasping
shrewd
as
we
were
and
as
normans
are
still
said
to
be
stood
more
fully
in
the
centre
of
the
movement
than
our
english
descendants
ever
did
we
were
a
part
and
a
great
part
of
the
church
of
france
and
of
europe
the
leos
and
gregories
of
the
tenth
and
eleventh
centuries
leaned
on
us
in
their
great
struggle
for
reform
our
duke
in
turned
the
old
canons
out
of
the
mount
in
order
to
bring
here
the
highest
influence
of
the
time
the
benedictine
monks
of
monte
cassino
richard
ii
grandfather
of
william
the
conqueror
began
this
abbey
church
in
and
helped
abbot
hildebert
to
build
it
when
william
the
conqueror
in
set
out
to
conquer
england
pope
alexander
ii
stood
behind
him
and
blessed
his
banner
from
that
moment
our
norman
dukes
cast
the
kings
of
france
into
the
shade
our
activity
was
not
limited
to
northern
europe
or
even
confined
by
anjou
and
gascony
when
we
stop
at
coutances
we
will
drive
out
to
hauteville
to
see
where
tancred
came
from
whose
sons
robert
and
roger
were
conquering
naples
and
sicily
at
the
time
when
the
abbey
church
was
building
on
the
mount
normans
were
everywhere
in
and
everywhere
in
the
lead
of
their
age
we
were
a
serious
race
if
you
want
other
proof
of
it
besides
our
record
in
war
and
in
politics
you
have
only
to
look
at
our
art
religious
art
is
the
measure
of
human
depth
and
sincerity
any
triviality
any
weakness
cries
aloud
if
this
church
on
the
mount
is
not
proof
enough
of
norman
character
we
will
stop
at
coutances
for
a
wider
view
then
we
will
go
to
caen
and
bayeux
from
there
it
would
almost
be
worth
our
while
to
leap
at
once
to
palermo
it
was
in
the
year
or
thereabouts
that
roger
began
the
cathedral
at
cefalu
and
the
chapel
royal
at
palermo
it
was
about
the
year
that
his
grandson
william
began
the
cathedral
of
monreale
no
art
either
greek
or
byzantine
italian
or
arab
has
ever
created
two
religious
types
so
beautiful
so
serious
so
impressive
and
yet
so
different
as
watching
over
its
northern
ocean
and
monreale
looking
down
over
its
forests
of
orange
and
lemon
on
palermo
and
the
sicilian
seas
down
nearly
to
the
end
of
the
twelfth
century
the
norman
was
fairly
master
of
the
world
in
architecture
as
in
arms
although
the
thirteenth
century
belonged
to
france
and
we
must
look
for
its
glories
on
the
seine
and
marne
and
loire
but
for
the
present
we
are
in
the
eleventh
century
tenants
of
the
duke
or
of
the
church
or
of
small
feudal
lords
who
take
their
names
from
the
neighbourhood
beaumont
carteret
greville
percy
pierpont
who
at
the
bidding
will
each
call
out
his
tenants
perhaps
ten
with
their
attendants
to
fight
in
brittany
or
in
the
vexin
toward
paris
or
on
the
great
campaign
for
the
conquest
of
england
which
is
to
come
within
ten
years
the
greatest
military
effort
that
has
been
made
in
western
europe
since
charlemagne
and
roland
were
defeated
at
roncesvalles
three
hundred
years
ago
for
the
moment
we
are
helping
to
quarry
granite
for
the
abbey
church
and
to
haul
it
to
the
mount
or
load
it
on
our
boat
we
never
fail
to
make
our
annual
pilgrimage
to
the
mount
on
the
archangel
day
october
we
expect
to
be
called
out
for
a
new
campaign
which
duke
william
threatens
against
brittany
and
we
hear
stories
that
harold
the
saxon
the
powerful
earl
of
wessex
in
england
is
a
guest
or
as
some
say
a
prisoner
or
a
hostage
at
the
duke
court
and
will
go
with
us
on
the
campaign
the
year
is
all
this
time
we
have
been
standing
on
the
parvis
looking
out
over
the
sea
and
sands
which
are
as
good
landscape
as
they
ever
were
or
turning
at
times
towards
the
church
door
which
is
the
pons
seclorum
the
bridge
of
ages
between
us
and
our
ancestors
now
that
we
have
made
an
attempt
such
as
it
is
to
get
our
minds
into
a
condition
to
cross
the
bridge
without
breaking
down
in
the
effort
we
enter
the
church
and
stand
face
to
face
with
century
architecture
a
which
dates
from
a
central
tower
or
its
piers
dating
from
and
a
church
completed
in
france
can
offer
few
buildings
of
this
importance
equally
old
with
dates
so
exact
perhaps
the
closest
parallel
to
michel
is
above
orleans
which
seems
to
have
been
a
shrine
almost
as
popular
as
the
mount
at
the
same
time
chartres
was
also
a
famous
shrine
but
of
the
virgin
and
the
west
porch
of
chartres
which
is
to
be
our
peculiar
pilgrimage
was
a
hundred
years
later
than
the
of
although
chartres
porch
is
the
usual
of
northern
french
art
queen
matilda
now
the
church
of
the
trinity
at
caen
dates
from
saint
sernin
at
toulouse
the
porch
of
the
abbey
church
at
moissac
at
clermont
the
abbey
church
at
vezelay
are
all
said
to
be
century
even
san
marco
at
venice
was
new
in
yet
in
norman
art
was
already
too
ambitious
certainly
nine
hundred
years
leave
their
traces
on
granite
as
well
as
on
other
material
but
the
granite
of
abbot
hildebert
would
have
stood
securely
enough
if
the
abbot
had
not
asked
too
much
from
it
perhaps
he
asked
too
much
from
the
archangel
for
the
thought
of
the
archangel
superiority
was
clearly
the
inspiration
of
his
plan
the
apex
of
the
granite
rock
rose
like
a
two
hundred
and
forty
feet
metres
above
mean
instead
of
cutting
the
summit
away
to
give
his
church
a
secure
rock
foundation
which
would
have
sacrificed
about
thirty
feet
of
height
the
abbot
took
the
apex
of
the
rock
for
his
level
and
on
all
sides
built
out
foundations
of
masonry
to
support
the
walls
of
his
church
the
apex
of
the
rock
is
the
floor
of
the
croisee
the
intersection
of
nave
and
transept
on
this
solid
foundation
the
abbot
rested
the
chief
weight
of
the
church
which
was
the
central
tower
supported
by
the
four
great
piers
which
still
stand
but
from
the
croisee
in
the
centre
westward
to
the
parapet
of
the
platform
the
abbot
filled
the
whole
space
with
masonry
and
his
successors
built
out
still
farther
until
some
two
hundred
feet
of
stonework
ends
now
in
a
perpendicular
wall
of
eighty
feet
or
more
in
this
space
are
several
ranges
of
chambers
but
the
structure
might
perhaps
have
proved
strong
enough
to
support
the
light
romanesque
front
which
was
usual
in
the
eleventh
century
had
not
fashions
in
architecture
changed
in
the
great
epoch
of
building
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
later
when
abbot
robert
de
torigny
thought
proper
to
reconstruct
the
west
front
and
build
out
two
towers
on
its
flanks
the
towers
were
no
doubt
beautiful
if
one
may
judge
from
the
towers
of
bayeux
and
coutances
but
their
weight
broke
down
the
vaulting
beneath
and
one
of
them
fell
in
in
the
whole
facade
began
to
give
way
and
in
not
only
the
facade
but
also
three
of
the
seven
spans
of
the
nave
were
pulled
down
of
abbot
hildebert
nave
only
four
arches
remain
still
the
overmastering
strength
of
the
eleventh
century
is
stamped
on
a
great
scale
here
not
only
in
the
four
spans
of
the
nave
and
in
the
transepts
but
chiefly
in
the
triumphal
columns
of
the
croisee
no
one
is
likely
to
forget
what
norman
architecture
was
who
takes
the
trouble
to
pass
once
through
this
fragment
of
its
earliest
bloom
the
dimensions
are
not
great
though
greater
than
safe
construction
warranted
abbot
hildebert
whole
church
did
not
exceed
two
hundred
and
thirty
feet
in
length
in
the
interior
and
the
span
of
the
triumphal
arch
was
only
about
feet
if
the
books
can
be
trusted
the
nave
of
the
appears
to
have
about
the
same
width
and
probably
neither
of
them
was
meant
to
be
vaulted
the
roof
was
of
timber
and
about
feet
high
at
its
apex
compared
with
the
great
churches
of
the
thirteenth
century
this
building
is
modest
but
its
size
is
not
what
matters
to
us
its
style
is
the
of
all
our
future
travels
here
is
your
first
church
how
does
it
affect
you
serious
and
simple
to
excess
is
it
not
young
people
rarely
enjoy
it
they
prefer
the
gothic
even
as
you
see
it
here
looking
at
us
from
the
choir
through
the
great
norman
arch
no
doubt
they
are
right
since
they
are
young
but
men
and
women
who
have
lived
long
and
are
tired
who
want
rest
who
have
done
with
aspirations
and
ambition
whose
life
has
been
a
broken
arch
feel
this
repose
and
as
they
feel
nothing
else
the
quiet
strength
of
these
curved
lines
the
solid
support
of
these
heavy
columns
the
moderate
proportions
even
the
modified
lights
the
absence
of
display
of
effort
of
satisfy
them
as
no
other
art
does
they
come
back
to
it
to
rest
after
a
long
circle
of
pilgrimage
the
cradle
of
rest
from
which
their
ancestors
started
even
here
they
find
the
repose
none
too
deep
indeed
when
you
look
longer
at
it
you
begin
to
doubt
whether
there
is
any
repose
in
it
at
all
whether
it
is
not
the
most
unreposeful
thought
ever
put
into
architectural
form
perched
on
the
extreme
point
of
this
abrupt
rock
the
church
militant
with
its
aspirant
archangel
stands
high
above
the
world
and
seems
to
threaten
heaven
itself
the
idea
is
the
stronger
and
more
restless
because
the
church
of
saint
michael
is
surrounded
and
protected
by
the
world
and
the
society
over
which
it
rises
as
duke
william
rested
on
his
barons
and
their
men
neither
the
saint
nor
the
duke
was
troubled
by
doubts
about
his
mission
church
and
state
soul
and
body
god
and
man
are
all
one
at
and
the
business
of
all
is
to
fight
each
in
his
own
way
or
to
stand
guard
for
each
other
neither
church
nor
state
is
intellectual
or
learned
or
even
strict
in
dogma
here
we
do
not
feel
the
trinity
at
all
the
virgin
but
little
christ
hardly
more
we
feel
only
the
archangel
and
the
unity
of
god
we
have
little
logic
here
and
simple
faith
but
we
have
energy
we
can
not
do
many
things
which
are
done
in
the
centre
of
civilization
at
byzantium
but
we
can
fight
and
we
can
build
a
church
no
doubt
we
think
first
of
the
church
and
next
of
our
temporal
lord
only
in
the
last
instance
do
we
think
of
our
private
affairs
and
our
private
affairs
sometimes
suffer
for
it
but
we
reckon
the
affairs
of
church
and
state
to
be
ours
too
and
we
carry
this
idea
very
far
our
church
on
the
mount
is
ambitious
restless
striving
for
effect
our
conquest
of
england
with
which
the
duke
is
infatuated
is
more
ambitious
still
but
all
this
is
a
trifle
to
the
outburst
which
is
coming
in
the
next
generation
and
saint
michael
on
his
mount
expresses
it
all
taking
architecture
as
an
expression
of
energy
we
can
some
day
compare
with
beauvais
and
draw
from
the
comparison
whatever
moral
suits
our
frame
of
mind
but
you
should
first
note
that
here
in
the
eleventh
century
the
church
however
or
unschooled
was
not
cheap
its
is
worth
noticing
because
it
was
in
its
art
michel
throughout
even
up
to
the
delicate
and
intricate
stonework
of
its
cloisters
is
built
of
granite
the
crypts
and
substructures
are
as
well
constructed
as
the
surfaces
most
exposed
to
view
when
we
get
to
chartres
which
is
largely
a
work
you
will
see
that
the
cathedral
there
too
is
superbly
built
of
the
hardest
and
heaviest
stone
within
reach
which
has
nowhere
settled
or
given
way
while
beneath
you
will
find
a
crypt
that
rivals
the
church
above
the
thirteenth
century
did
not
build
so
the
great
cathedrals
after
show
economy
and
sometimes
worse
the
world
grew
cheap
as
worlds
must
you
may
like
it
all
the
better
for
being
less
serious
less
heroic
less
militant
and
more
what
the
french
call
bourgeois
just
as
you
may
like
the
style
of
louis
xv
better
than
that
of
louis
xiv
madame
du
barry
better
than
madame
de
montespan
for
taste
is
free
and
all
styles
are
good
which
amuse
but
since
we
are
now
beginning
with
the
earliest
in
order
to
step
down
gracefully
to
the
stage
whatever
it
is
where
you
prefer
to
stop
we
must
try
to
understand
a
little
of
the
kind
of
energy
which
norman
art
expressed
or
would
have
expressed
if
it
had
thought
in
our
modes
the
only
word
which
describes
the
norman
style
is
the
french
word
naif
littre
says
that
naif
comes
from
natif
as
vulgar
comes
from
vulgus
as
though
native
traits
must
be
simple
and
commonness
must
be
vulgar
both
these
derivative
meanings
were
strange
to
the
eleventh
century
naivete
was
simply
natural
and
vulgarity
was
merely
coarse
norman
naivete
was
not
different
in
kind
from
the
naivete
of
burgundy
or
gascony
or
lombardy
but
it
was
slightly
different
in
expression
as
you
will
see
when
you
travel
south
here
at
we
have
only
a
mutilated
trunk
of
an
church
to
judge
by
we
have
not
even
a
facade
and
shall
have
to
stop
at
some
norman
village
at
thaon
or
ouistreham
to
find
a
west
front
which
might
suit
the
abbey
here
but
wherever
we
find
it
we
shall
find
something
a
little
more
serious
more
military
and
more
practical
than
you
will
meet
in
other
romanesque
work
farther
south
so
too
the
central
tower
or
lantern
the
most
striking
feature
of
norman
churches
has
fallen
here
at
and
we
shall
have
to
replace
it
from
and
lessay
and
falaise
we
shall
find
much
to
say
about
the
value
of
the
lantern
on
a
norman
church
and
the
singular
power
it
expresses
we
shall
have
still
more
to
say
of
the
towers
which
flank
the
west
front
of
norman
churches
but
these
are
mostly
and
will
lead
us
far
beyond
coutances
and
bayeux
from
fleche
to
fleche
till
we
come
to
the
fleche
of
all
fleches
at
chartres
we
shall
have
a
whole
chapter
of
study
too
over
the
century
apse
but
here
at
abbot
hildebert
choir
went
the
way
of
his
nave
and
tower
he
built
out
even
more
boldly
to
the
east
than
to
the
west
and
although
the
choir
stood
for
some
four
hundred
years
which
is
a
sufficient
life
for
most
architecture
the
foundations
gave
way
at
last
and
it
fell
in
in
the
midst
of
the
english
wars
and
remained
a
ruin
until
then
it
was
rebuilt
a
monument
of
the
last
days
of
the
gothic
so
that
now
standing
at
the
western
door
you
can
look
down
the
church
and
see
the
two
limits
of
mediaeval
architecture
married
together
the
earliest
norman
and
the
latest
french
through
the
romanesque
arches
of
you
look
into
the
exuberant
choir
of
latest
gothic
finished
in
although
the
two
structures
are
some
five
hundred
years
apart
they
live
pleasantly
together
the
gothic
died
gracefully
in
france
the
choir
is
charming
far
more
charming
than
the
nave
as
the
beautiful
woman
is
more
charming
than
the
elderly
man
one
need
not
quarrel
about
styles
of
beauty
as
long
as
the
man
and
woman
are
evidently
satisfied
and
love
and
admire
each
other
still
with
all
the
solidity
of
faith
to
hold
them
up
but
at
least
one
can
not
help
seeing
as
one
looks
from
the
older
to
the
younger
style
that
whatever
the
woman
century
charm
may
be
it
is
not
the
man
trait
of
naivete
far
from
it
the
simple
serious
silent
dignity
and
energy
of
the
eleventh
century
have
gone
something
more
complicated
stands
in
their
place
graceful
rhetorical
and
beautiful
as
perfect
rhetoric
with
its
clearness
light
and
line
and
the
wealth
of
tracery
that
verges
on
the
florid
the
crypt
of
the
same
period
beneath
is
almost
finer
still
and
even
in
seriousness
stands
up
boldly
by
the
side
of
the
romanesque
but
we
have
no
time
to
run
off
into
the
sixteenth
century
we
have
still
to
learn
the
alphabet
of
art
in
france
one
must
live
deep
into
the
eleventh
century
in
order
to
understand
the
twelfth
and
even
after
passing
years
in
the
twelfth
we
shall
find
the
thirteenth
in
many
ways
a
world
of
its
own
with
a
beauty
not
always
inherited
and
sometimes
not
bequeathed
at
the
mount
we
can
go
no
farther
into
the
eleventh
as
far
as
concerns
architecture
we
shall
have
to
follow
the
romanesque
to
caen
and
so
up
the
seine
to
the
ile
de
france
and
across
to
the
loire
and
the
rhone
far
to
the
south
where
its
home
lay
all
the
other
work
has
been
destroyed
here
or
built
over
except
at
one
point
on
the
level
of
the
splendid
crypt
we
just
turned
from
called
the
gros
piliers
beneath
the
choir
there
according
to
corroyer
in
a
corner
between
great
constructions
of
the
twelfth
century
and
the
vast
merveille
of
the
thirteenth
the
old
refectory
of
the
eleventh
was
left
as
a
passage
from
one
group
of
buildings
to
the
other
below
it
is
the
kitchen
of
hildebert
above
on
the
level
of
the
church
was
the
dormitory
these
abbatial
buildings
faced
north
and
west
and
are
close
to
the
present
parvis
opposite
the
last
arch
of
the
nave
the
lower
levels
of
hildebert
plan
served
as
supports
or
buttresses
to
the
church
above
and
must
therefore
be
older
than
the
nave
probably
older
than
the
triumphal
piers
of
hildebert
planned
them
in
and
died
after
carrying
his
plans
out
so
far
that
they
could
be
completed
by
abbot
ralph
de
beaumont
who
was
especially
selected
by
duke
william
in
more
for
his
high
birth
than
for
his
merits
ralph
de
beaumont
died
in
and
was
succeeded
by
abbot
ranulph
an
especial
favourite
of
duchess
matilda
and
held
in
high
esteem
by
duke
william
the
list
of
names
shows
how
much
social
importance
was
attributed
to
the
place
the
abbot
duties
included
that
of
entertainment
on
a
great
scale
the
mount
was
one
of
the
most
famous
shrines
of
northern
europe
we
are
free
to
take
for
granted
that
all
the
great
people
of
normandy
slept
at
the
mount
and
supposing
corroyer
to
be
right
that
they
dined
in
this
room
between
when
the
building
must
have
been
in
use
down
to
when
the
new
abbatial
quarters
were
built
how
far
the
monastic
rules
restricted
social
habits
is
a
matter
for
antiquaries
to
settle
if
they
can
and
how
far
those
rules
were
observed
in
the
case
of
great
secular
princes
but
the
eleventh
century
was
not
very
strict
and
the
rule
of
the
benedictines
was
always
mild
until
the
cistercians
and
saint
bernard
stiffened
its
discipline
toward
even
then
the
church
showed
strong
leanings
toward
secular
poetry
and
popular
tastes
the
drama
belonged
to
it
almost
exclusively
and
the
mysteries
and
miracle
plays
which
were
acted
under
its
patronage
often
contained
nothing
of
religion
except
the
miracle
the
greatest
poem
of
the
eleventh
century
was
the
chanson
de
roland
and
of
that
the
church
took
a
sort
of
possession
at
chartres
we
shall
find
charlemagne
and
roland
dear
to
the
virgin
and
at
about
the
same
time
as
far
away
as
at
assisi
in
the
perugian
country
saint
francis
himself
the
nearest
approach
the
western
world
ever
made
to
an
oriental
incarnation
of
the
divine
essence
loved
the
french
romans
and
typified
himself
in
the
chanson
de
roland
with
the
chanson
de
roland
is
almost
one
the
chanson
is
in
poetry
what
the
mount
is
in
architecture
without
the
chanson
one
can
not
approach
the
feeling
which
the
eleventh
century
built
into
the
archangel
church
probably
there
was
never
a
day
certainly
never
a
week
during
several
centuries
when
portions
of
the
chanson
were
not
sung
or
recited
at
the
mount
and
if
there
was
one
room
where
it
was
most
at
home
this
one
supposing
it
to
be
the
old
refectory
claims
to
be
the
place

who

they
still
read

as

away
the
pebbles
they
must
be
lifted

when

is
beauty
translation
is
an
evil
chiefly
because
every
one
who
cares
for
mediaeval
architecture
cares
for
mediaeval
french
and
ought
to
care
still
more
for
mediaeval
english
the
language
of
this
roman
was
the
literary
language
of
england
william
of
pair
was
a
subject
of
henry
ii
king
of
england
and
normandy
his
verses
like
those
of
richard
are
monuments
of
english
literature
to
this
day
their
ballad
measure
is
better
suited
to
english
than
to
french
even
the
words
and
idioms
are
more
english
than
french
any
one
who
attacks
them
boldly
will
find
that
the
vers
romieus
run
along
like
a
ballad
singing
their
own
meaning
and
troubling
themselves
very
little
whether
the
meaning
is
exact
or
not
one
translation
is
sure
to
be
full
of
gross
blunders
but
the
supreme
blunder
is
that
of
translating
at
all
when
one
is
trying
to
catch
not
a
fact
but
a
feeling
if
translate
one
must
we
had
best
begin
by
trying
to
be
literal
under
protest
that
it
matters
not
a
straw
whether
we
succeed
art
was
not
precise
still
less
precieuse
like
moliere
famous
prudes
the
verses
of
the
young
monk
william
who
came
from
the
little
norman
village
of
near
granville
within
sight
of
the
mount
were
verses
not
meant
to
be
brilliant
simple
human
beings
like
rhyme
better
than
prose
though
both
may
say
the
same
thing
as
they
like
a
curved
line
better
than
a
straight
one
or
a
blue
better
than
a
grey
but
apart
from
the
sensual
appetite
they
chose
rhyme
in
creating
their
literature
for
the
practical
reason
that
they
remembered
it
better
than
prose
men
had
to
carry
their
libraries
in
their
heads
these
lines
of
william
beginning
his
story
are
valuable
because
for
once
they
give
a
name
and
a
date

in

matters
than
not
if
at
that
price
a
freer
feeling
of
the
art
could
be
caught
better
still
you
can
turn
to
chaucer
who
wrote
his
canterbury
pilgrimage
two
hundred
years
afterwards
whanne
that

with
his

sote
the

especially

they
wende
the
holy
blisful
martyr
for
to
seke
that
hem
hath
holpen
whan
that
they
were
seke
the
passion
for
pilgrimages
was
universal
among
our
ancestors
as
far
back
as
we
can
trace
them
for
at
least
a
thousand
years
it
was
their
chief
delight
and
is
not
yet
extinct
to
feel
the
art
of
and
chartres
we
have
got
to
become
pilgrims
again
but
just
now
the
point
of
most
interest
is
not
the
pilgrim
so
much
as
the
minstrel
who
sang
to
amuse
him
the
jugleor
or
jongleur
who
was
at
home
in
every
abbey
castle
or
cottage
as
well
as
at
every
shrine
the
jugleor
became
a
jongleur
and
degenerated
into
the
the
minstrel
or
menestrier
became
very
early
a
word
of
abuse
equivalent
to
blackguard
and
from
the
beginning
the
profession
seems
to
have
been
socially
decried
like
that
of
a
singer
or
dancer
in
later
times
but
in
the
eleventh
century
or
perhaps
earlier
still
the
jongleur
seems
to
have
been
a
poet
and
to
have
composed
the
songs
he
sang
the
immense
mass
of
poetry
known
as
the
chansons
de
geste
seems
to
have
been
composed
as
well
as
sung
by
the
unnamed
homers
of
france
and
of
all
spots
in
the
many
provinces
where
the
french
language
in
its
many
dialects
prevailed
should
have
been
the
favourite
with
the
jongleur
not
only
because
the
swarms
of
pilgrims
assured
him
food
and
an
occasional
small
piece
of
silver
but
also
because
saint
michael
was
the
saint
militant
of
all
the
warriors
whose
exploits
in
war
were
the
subject
of
the
chansons
de
geste
william
of
pair
was
a
he
was
not
a
minstrel
and
his
roman
was
not
a
chanson
it
was
made
to
read
not
to
recite
but
the
chanson
de
roland
was
a
different
affair
so
it
was
too
with
william
contemporaries
and
rivals
or
predecessors
the
monumental
poets
of
literature
wace
whose
rhymed
history
of
the
norman
dukes
which
he
called
the
roman
de
rou
or
rollo
is
an
english
classic
of
the
first
rank
was
a
canon
of
bayeux
when
william
of
was
writing
at
his
rival
benoist
who
wrote
another
famous
chronicle
on
the
same
subject
was
also
a
historian
and
not
a
singer
in
that
day
literature
meant
verse
elegance
in
french
prose
did
not
yet
exist
but
the
elegancies
of
poetry
in
the
twelfth
century
were
as
different
in
kind
from
the
grand
style
of
the
eleventh
as
virgil
was
different
from
homer
william
of
introduces
us
to
the
pilgrimage
and
to
the
jongleur
as
they
had
existed
at
least
two
hundred
years
before
his
time
and
were
to
exist
two
hundred
years
after
him
of
all
our
two
hundred
and
fifty
million
arithmetical
ancestors
who
were
going
on
pilgrimages
in
the
middle
of
the
eleventh
century
the
two
who
would
probably
most
interest
every
one
after
eight
hundred
years
have
passed
would
be
william
the
norman
and
harold
the
saxon
through
william
of
and
wace
and
benoist
and
the
most
charming
literary
monument
of
all
the
bayeux
tapestry
of
queen
matilda
we
can
build
up
the
story
of
such
a
pilgrimage
which
shall
be
as
historically
exact
as
the
battle
of
hastings
and
as
artistically
true
as
the
abbey
church
according
to
wace
roman
de
rou
when
harold
father
earl
godwin
died
april
harold
wished
to
obtain
the
release
of
certain
hostages
a
brother
and
a
cousin
whom
godwin
had
given
to

confessor
as
security
for
his
good
behaviour
and
whom
edward
had
sent
to
duke
william
for
wace
took
the
story
from
other
and
older
sources
and
its
accuracy
is
much
disputed
but
the
fact
that
harold
went
to
normandy
seems
to
be
certain
and
you
will
see
at
bayeux
the
picture
of
harold
asking
permission
of
king
edward
to
make
the
journey
and
departing
on
horseback
with
his
hawk
and
hounds
and
followers
to
take
ship
at
bosham
near
chichester
and
portsmouth
the
date
alone
is
doubtful
common
sense
seems
to
suggest
that
the
earliest
possible
date
could
not
be
too
early
to
explain
the
rash
youth
of
the
aspirant
to
a
throne
who
put
himself
in
the
power
of
a
rival
in
the
eleventh
century
when
that
rival
chanced
to
be
william
the
bastard
not
even
boyhood
could
excuse
the
folly
but
freeman
the
chief
authority
on
this
delicate
subject
inclined
to
think
that
harold
was
forty
years
old
when
he
committed
his
blunder
and
that
the
year
was
about
between
and
the
historian
is
free
to
choose
what
year
he
likes
and
the
tourist
is
still
freer
to
save
trouble
for
the
memory
the
year
will
serve
since
this
is
the
date
of
the
triumphal
arches
of
the
abbey
church
on
the
mount
harold
in
sailing
from
the
neighbourhood
of
portsmouth
must
have
been
bound
for
caen
or
rouen
but
the
usual
west
winds
drove
him
eastward
till
he
was
thrown
ashore
on
the
coast
of
ponthieu
between
abbeville
and
boulogne
where
he
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
count
of
ponthieu
from
whom
he
was
rescued
or
ransomed
by
duke
william
of
normandy
and
taken
to
rouen
according
to
wace
and
the
roman

william
kept
harold
many
a
day
as
was
his
due
in
great
honour
to
many
a
rich
tournament
made
him
go
very
nobly
horses
and
arms
gave
him
and
into
brittany
led
him
i
know
not
truly
whether
three
or
four
times
when
he
had
to
make
war
on
the
bretons
perhaps
the
allusion
to
rich
tournaments
belongs
to
the
time
of
wace
rather
than
to
that
of
harold
a
century
earlier
before
the
first
crusade
but
certainly
harold
did
go
with
william
on
at
least
one
raid
into
brittany
and
the
charming
tapestry
of
bayeux
which
tradition
calls
by
the
name
of
queen
matilda
shows
william
crossing
the
sands
beneath
with
the
latin
legend
et
venerunt
ad
montem
michaelis
hic
harold
dux
trahebat
eos
de
arena
venerunt
ad

cononis
they
came
to
michel
and
harold
dragged
them
out
of
the
quicksands
they
came
to
the
river
couesnon
harold
must
have
got
great
fame
by
saving
life
on
the
sands
to
be
remembered
and
recorded
by
the
normans
themselves
after
they
had
killed
him
but
this
is
the
affair
of
historians
tourists
note
only
that
harold
and
william
came
to
the
mount
venerunt
ad
montem
they
would
never
have
dared
to
pass
it
on
such
an
errand
without
stopping
to
ask
the
help
of
saint
michael
if
william
and
harold
came
to
the
mount
they
certainly
dined
or
supped
in
the
old
refectory
which
is
where
we
have
lain
in
wait
for
them
where
duke
william
was
his
jongleur
jugleor
was
not
far
and
wace
knew
as
every
one
in
normandy
seemed
to
know
who
this
favourite
was
his
name
his
character
and
his
song
to
him
wace
owed
one
of
the
most
famous
passages
in
his
story
of
the
assault
at
hastings
where
duke
william
and
his
battle
began
their
advance

the
english

doubt
the

as
they
very
properly
doubt
everything
they
maintain
that
the
chanson
de

was
not
as
old
as
the
battle
of
hastings
and
certainly
wace
gave
no
sufficient
proof
of
it
poetry
was
not
usually
written
to
prove
facts
wace
wrote
a
hundred
years
after
the
battle
of
hastings
one
is
not
morally
required
to
be
pedantic
to
the
point
of
knowing
more
than
wace
knew
but
the
feeling
of
scepticism
before
so
serious
a
monument
as
is
annoying
the
chanson
de
roland
ought
not
to
be
trifled
with
at
least
by
tourists
in
search
of
art
one
is
shocked
at
the
possibility
of
being
deceived
about
the
of
american
genealogy
taillefer
and
the
song
rest
on
the
same
evidence
that
duke
william
and
harold
and
the
battle
itself
rest
upon
and
to
doubt
the
chanson
is
to
call
the
very
roll
of
battle
abbey
in
question
the
whole
fabric
of
society
totters
the
british
peerage
turns
pale
wace
did
not
invent
all
his
facts
william
of
malmesbury
is
supposed
to
have
written
his
prose
chronicle
about
when
many
of
the
men
who
fought
at
hastings
must
have
been
alive
and
william
expressly
said
tune
cantilena
rollandi
inchoata
ut
martium
viri
exemplum
pugnaturos
accenderet

dei
auxilio
praelium

starting
the
chanson
de
roland
to
inflame
the
fighting
temper
of
the
men
battle
was
joined
this
seems
enough
proof
to
satisfy
any
sceptic
yet
critics
still
suggest
that
the
cantilena
rollandi
must
have
been
a
norman
chanson
de
rou
or
rollo
or
at
best
an
earlier
version
of
the
chanson
de
roland
but
no
norman
chanson
would
have
inflamed
the
martial
spirit
of
william
army
which
was
largely
french
and
as
for
the
age
of
the
version
it
is
quite
immaterial
for
the
actual
version
is
old
enough
taillefer
himself
is
more
vital
to
the
interest
of
the
dinner
in
the
refectory
and
his
name
was
not
mentioned
by
william
of
malmesbury
if
the
song
was
started
by
the
duke
order
it
was
certainly
started
by
the
duke
jongleur
and
the
name
of
this
jongleur
happens
to
be
known
on
still
better
authority
than
that
of
william
of
malmesbury
guy
of
amiens
went
to
england
in
as
almoner
of
queen
matilda
and
there
wrote
a
latin
poem
on
the
battle
of
hastings
which
must
have
been
complete
within
ten
years
after
the
battle
was
fought
for

said

and
terrified
the
english
the
rhymed
chronicle
of
geoffrey
gaimer
who
wrote
about
and
that
of
benoist
who
was
wace
rival
added
the
story
that
taillefer
died
in
the
melee
the
most
unlikely
part
of
the
tale
was
after
all
not
the
singing
of
the
chanson
but
the
prayer
of
taillefer
to
the
duke
otreiez

legally
translated
taillefer
asked
to
be
ennobled
and
offered
to
pay
for
it
with
his
life
the
request
of
a
jongleur
to
lead
the

incredible
in

leads
only
to
unite

the

of
the

of

and
his
breton
campaign
of
the

akin
they
go
together
and
explain

their
common
trait

their
military
character
peculiar
to
the

the

the

so
masculine
that
in

the

was

was

never
after
the
first

did
any
great
poem
rise
to
such
heroism
as
to
sustain
itself
without
a

even

attempted
no
such
feat

be

the

lines
which
had
such
a
direct
and
personal
bearing
on
every
one
who
heard
them
as
to
sound
like
prophecy
within
ten
years
william
was
to
stand
in
england
where
charlemagne
stood
in
spain
his
mind
was
full
of
it
and
of
the
means
to
attain
it
and
harold
was
even
more
absorbed
than
he
by
the
anxiety
of
the
position
harold
had
been
obliged
to
take
oath
that
he
would
support
william
claim
to
the
english
throne
but
he
was
still
undecided
and
william
knew
men
too
well
to
feel
much
confidence
in
an
oath
as
taillefer
sang
on
he
reached
the
part
of
ganelon
the
typical
traitor
the
invariable
figure
of
mediaeval
society
no
feudal
lord
was
without
a
ganelon
duke
william
saw
them
all
about
him
he
might
have
felt
that
harold
would
play
the
part
but
if
harold
should
choose
rather
to
be
roland
duke
william
could
have
foretold
that
his
own
brother
bishop
odo
after
gorging
himself
on
the
plunder
of
half
england
would
turn
into
a
ganelon
so
dangerous
as
to
require
a
prison
for
life
when
taillefer
reached
the
scenes
there
was
no
further
need
of
imagination
to
realize
them
they
were
scenes
of
yesterday
and
for
that
matter
charlemagne
or
his
successor
was
still
at
aix
and
the
moors
were
still
in
spain
archbishop
turpin
of
rheims
had
fought
with
sword
and
mace
in
spain
while
bishop
odo
of
bayeux
was
to
marshal
his
men
at
hastings
like
a
modern
general
with
a
staff
but
both
were
equally
at
home
on
the
field
of
battle
verse
by
verse
the
song
was
a
literal
mirror
of
the
mount
the
battle
of
hastings
was
to
be
fought
on
the
archangel
day
what
happened
to
roland
at
roncesvalles
was
to
happen
to
harold
at
hastings
and
harold
as
he
was
dying
like
roland
was
to
see
his
brother
gyrth
die
like
oliver
even
taillefer
was
to
be
a
part
and
a
distinguished
part
of
his
chanson
sooner
or
later
all
were
to
die
in
the
large
and
simple
way
of
the
eleventh
century
duke
william
himself
twenty
years
later
was
to
meet
a
violent
death
at
mantes
in
the
same
spirit
and
if
bishop
odo
did
not
die
in
battle
he
died
at
least
like
an
hero
on
the
first
crusade
first
or
last
the
whole
company
died
in
fight
or
in
prison
or
on
crusade
while
the
monks
shrived
them
and
prayed
then
taillefer
certainly
sang
the
great
even
to
this
day
every
french
if
he
knows
no
other
poetry
knows
these
verses
by
heart
in
the
eleventh
century
they
wrung
the
heart
of
every
in
europe
whose
school
was
the
field
of
battle
and
the
fight
no
modern
singer
ever
enjoys
such
power
over
an
audience
as
taillefer
exercised
over
these
men
who
were
actors
as
well
as
listeners
in
the
melee
at
roncesvalles
overborne

must
imagine
the
voice

doubtless
taillefer
acted
each
motive
when

rose
when

spoke

with
the
singular
courtesy
of

and
dignity
of
soldiers
bowed
to
each
other
in

and
turned
to
face
their
deaths
taillefer
may
have
indicated

there
roland
sits
unconscious
on
his
horse
and
oliver
who
wounded
is
to
death
so
much
has
bled
his
eyes
grow
dark
to
him
nor
far
nor
near
can
see
so
clear
as
to
recognize
any
mortal
man
his
friend
when
he
has
encountered
him
he
strikes
upon
the
helmet
of
gemmed
gold
splits
it
from
the
crown
to
the
but
to
the
head
he
has
not
reached
at
all
at
this
blow
roland
looks
at
him
asks
him
gently
and
softly
sir
friend
do
you
it
in

you
know
is
roland
who
has
so
loved
you
in

i

such

no
one
should
try
to
render
this
into

or
indeed
into
modern

verse
but
any
one
who
will
take
the
trouble
to
catch
the

that
each

in

however
the

can
follow
the

as
well
as
though
it
were
greek
hexameter
he
will
feel
the
simple

of
the

in

the

they
had

and
were
to
be
there
again
as
the

approached
they
saw
the

itself
probably
they
had
seen
it
every

more

was

by

when

tugging
at

blow

he
killed

death
near
he
prepared

his

was
for

his
sword
which
he
could
not
leave
to
infidels
in
the
singular
triple
repetition
which
gives
more
of
the
same
solidity
and
architectural
weight
to
the
verse
he
made
three
attempts
to
break
the
sword
with
a
lament
a

for
each
three
times
he
struck
with
all
his

against

each
time
the

rebounded
without

roland
strikes
on
a
grey
stone
more
of
it
cuts
off
than
i
can
tell
you
the

grinds

shatters
not
nor
breaks
upward
against

it

the

sees
that

it
very

he
mourns
it
to

ah

how
fair
you
are
and
sacred
in
your
golden

are
many
relics
the
tooth
of
saint
peter
and
blood
of
saint
basil
and
hair
of
my
seigneur
of
the

too
of
saint

it
is
not
right
that
pagans
should
own
you
by
christians
you
should
be
served
nor
should
man
have
you
who
does
cowardice
many

by
you
i
have
conquered
that
charles
holds
who
has
the
white

and
emperor
of
them
is
noble
and
rich
this
laisse
is
even
more
than
the
other
but
it
appealed
no
longer
to
the
warriors
it
spoke
rather
to
the
monks
to
the
warriors
the
sword
itself
was
the
religion
and
the
relics
were
details
of
ornament
or
strength
to
the
priest
the

of

was
more
eloquent
than
the

the

even
to
us
it
is
interesting
if
it
is
understood
roland
had
gone
on
pilgrimage
to
the
holy
land
he
had
stopped
at
rome
and
won
the
friendship
of
saint
peter
as
the
tooth
proved
he
had
passed
through
constantinople
and
secured
the
help
of
saint
basil
he
had
reached
jerusalem
and
gained
the
affection
of
the
virgin
he
had
come
home
to
france
and
secured
the
support
of
his
seigneur
saint
denis
for
roland
like
hugh
capet
was
a
of
saint

to

was

at

had

these
for

charlemagne
with
the
help
of
his
immediate
spiritual
lord
or

saint

but
the

knew
that
he
could
never
have
done
these
feats
without
the
help
of
saint
peter
saint
basil
and
saint
mary
the
blessed
virgin
whose
relics
in
the
hilt
of
his
sword
were
worth
more
than
any
ransom
to
this
day
a
tunic
of
the
virgin
is
the
most
precious
property
of
the
cathedral
at
chartres
either
one
of
roland
relics
would
have
made
the
glory
of
any
shrine
in
europe
and
every
monk
knew
their
enormous
value
and
power
better
than
he
knew
the
value
of
roland

yet
even
the
religion
is
martial
as
though
it
were
meant
for
the
fighting
archangel
and
odo
of
bayeux
the
relics
serve
the
sword
the
sword
is
not
in
service
of
the

as
the
approaches
the

roland

has

the

had

the
soul
of
the
count
they
bear
to
paradise
our
age
has
lost
much
of
its
ear
for
poetry
as
it
has
its
eye
for
colour
and
line
and
its
taste
for
war
and
worship
wine
and
women
not
one
man
in
a
hundred
thousand
could
now
feel
what
the
eleventh
century
felt
in
these
verses
of
the
chanson
and
there
is
no
reason
for
trying
to
do
so
but
there
is
a
certain
use
in
trying
for
once
to
understand
not
so
much
the
feeling
as
the
meaning
the
naivete
of
the
poetry
is
that
of
the
society
god
the
father
was
the
feudal
seigneur
who
raised
lazarus
his
baron
or
vassal
from
the
grave
and
freed
daniel
as
an
evidence
of
his
power
and
loyalty
a
seigneur
who
never
lied
or
was
false
to
his
word
god
the
father
as
feudal
seigneur
absorbs
the
trinity
and
what
is
more
significant
absorbs
or
excludes
also
the
virgin
who
is
not
mentioned
in
the
prayer
to
this
seigneur
roland
in
dying
proffered
puroffrit
his
gauntlet
death
was
an
act
of
homage
god
sent
down
his
archangel
gabriel
as
his
representative
to
accept
the
homage
and
receive
the
glove
to
duke
william
and
his
barons
nothing
could
seem
more
natural
and
correct
god
was
not
farther
away
than
charlemagne
correct
as
the
law
may
have
been
the
religion
even
at
that
time
must
have
seemed
to
the
monks
to
need
professional
advice
life
was
not
exemplary
the
chanson
had
taken
pains
to
show
that
the
disaster
at
roncesvalles
was
due
to
roland
headstrong
folly
and
temper
in
dying
roland
had
not
once
thought
of
these
faults
or
repented
of
his
worldly
ambitions
or
mentioned
the
name
of
alda
his
betrothed
he
had
clung
to
the
memory
of
his
wars
and
conquests
his
lineage
his
earthly
seigneur
charlemagne
and
of
douce
france
he
had
forgotten
to
give
so
much
as
an
allusion
to
christ
the
poet
regarded
all
these
matters
as
the
affair
of
the
church
all
the
warrior
cared
for
was
courage
loyalty
and
prowess
the
interest
of
these
details
lies
not
in
the
scholarship
or
the
historical
truth
or
even
the
local
colour
so
much
as
in
the
art
the
naivete
of
the
thought
is
repeated
by
the
simplicity
of
the
verse
word
and
thought
are
equally
monosyllabic
nothing
ever

it
the

the
words
may
remain
exactly
the
same
but
the
poetry
will
have
gone
out
of
them
five
hundred
years
later
even
the
english
critics
had
so
far
lost
their
sense
for
military
poetry
that
they
professed
to
be
shocked
by
milton
monosyllables
whereat
he
inly
raged
and
as
they
talked
smote
him
into
the

milton
language
was
indeed
more

archaic
and

it

the

the
action
of
dying
is
felt
like
the
dropping
of
a
keystone
into
the
vault
and
if
the
romanesque
arches
in
the

which
are

they
would

upon
their

have
their
heads
inclined
folded
their

and
sunken
to
their
rest
many
thousands
of
times
these
verses
must
have
been
sung
at
the
mount
and
echoed
in
every
castle
and
on
every
from
the
welsh
marches
to
the
shores
of
the
dead
sea
no
modern
opera
or
play
ever
approached
the
popularity
of
the
chanson
none
has
ever
expressed
with
anything
like
the
same
completeness
the
society
that
produced
it
chanted
by
every
minstrel
known
by
heart
from
beginning
to
end
by
every
man
and
woman

child
lay
or
clerical
translated
into
every
tongue
more
intensely
felt
if
possible
in
italy
and
spain
than
in
normandy
and
england
perhaps
most
effective
as
a
work
of
art
when
sung
by
the
templars
in
their
great
castles
in
the
holy
land
it
is
now
best
felt
at
michel
and
from
the
first
must
have
been
there
at
home
the
proof
is
the
line
evidently
inserted
for
the
sake
of
its
local
effect
which
invoked
saint
michael
in
peril
of
the
sea
at
the
climax
of
roland
death
and
one
needs
no
original
documents
or
contemporary
authorities
to
prove
that
when
taillefer
came
to
this
invocation
not
only
duke
william
and
his
barons
but
still
more
abbot
ranulf
and
his
monks
broke
into
a
frenzy
of
sympathy
which
expressed
the
masculine
and
military
passions
of
the
archangel
better
than
it
accorded
with
the
rules
of
saint
benedict
chapter
iii
the
merveille
the
nineteenth
century
moved
fast
and
furious
so
that
one
who
moved
in
it
felt
sometimes
giddy
watching
it
spin
but
the
eleventh
moved
faster
and
more
furiously
still
the
norman
conquest
of
england
was
an
immense
effort
and
its
consequences
were
but
the
first
crusade
was
altogether
the
most
interesting
event
in
european
history
never
has
the
western
world
shown
anything
like
the
energy
and
unity
with
which
she
then
flung
herself
on
the
east
and
for
the
moment
made
the
east
recoil
barring
her
family
quarrels
europe
was
a
unity
then
in
thought
will
and
object
christianity
was
the
unit
and
byzantium
were
near
each
other
the
emperor
constantine
and
the
emperor
charlemagne
were
figured
as
allies
and
friends
in
the
popular
legend
the
east
was
the
common
enemy
always
superior
in
wealth
and
numbers
frequently
in
energy
and
sometimes
in
thought
and
art
the
outburst
of
the
first
crusade
was
splendid
even
in
a
military
sense
but
it
was
great
beyond
comparison
in
its
reflection
in
architecture
ornament
poetry
colour
religion
and
philosophy
its
men
were
astonishing
and
its
women
were
worth
all
the
rest
better
than
any
other
spot
in
the
world
keeps
the
architectural
record
of
that
ferment
much
as
the
sicilian
temples
keep
the
record
of
the
similar
outburst
of
greek
energy
art
poetry
and
thought
fifteen
hundred
years
before
of
the
eleventh
century
it
is
true
nothing
but
the
church
remains
at
the
mount
and
if
studied
further
the
century
has
got
to
be
sought
elsewhere
which
is
not
difficult
since
it
is
preserved
in
any
number
of
churches
in
every
path
of
tourist
travel
normandy
is
full
of
it
bayeux
and
caen
contain
little
else
at
the
mount
the
work
was
antiquated
before
it
was
finished
in
the
year
abbot
roger
ii
was
obliged
to
plan
and
construct
a
new
group
in
such
haste
that
it
is
said
to
have
been
finished
in
it
extends
from
what
we
have
supposed
to
be
the
old
refectory
to
the
parvis
and
abuts
on
the
three
lost
spans
of
the
church
covering
about
one
hundred
and
twenty
feet
as
usual
there
were
three
levels
a
crypt
or
gallery
beneath
known
as
the
aquilon
a
cloister
or
promenoir
above
and
on
the
level
of
the
church
a
dormitory
now
lost
the
group
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
in
france
another
pons
seclorum
an
antechamber
to
the
west
portal
of
chartres
which
bears
the
same
date
i
it
is
the
famous
period
of
transition
the
glory
of
the
twelfth
century
the
object
of
our
pilgrimage
art
is
a
fairly
large
field
where
no
one
need
jostle
his
neighbour
and
no
one
need
shut
himself
up
in
a
corner
but
if
one
insists
on
taking
a
corner
of
preference
one
might
offer
some
excuse
for
choosing
the
gothic
transition
the
quiet
restrained
strength
of
the
romanesque
married
to
the
graceful
curves
and
vaulting
imagination
of
the
gothic
makes
a
union
nearer
the
ideal
than
is
often
allowed
in
marriage
the
french
in
their
best
days
loved
it
with
a
constancy
that
has
thrown
a
sort
of
aureole
over
their
fickleness
since
they
never
tired
of
its
possibilities
sometimes
they
put
the
pointed
arch
within
the
round
or
above
it
sometimes
they
put
the
round
within
the
pointed
sometimes
a
roman
arch
covered
a
cluster
of
pointed
windows
as
though
protecting
and
caressing
its
children
sometimes
a
huge
pointed
arch
covered
a
great
spreading
across
the
whole
front
of
an
enormous
cathedral
with
an
arcade
of
romanesque
windows
beneath
the
french
architects
felt
no
discord
and
there
was
none
even
the
pure
gothic
was
put
side
by
side
with
the
pure
roman
you
will
see
no
later
gothic
than
the
choir
of
the
abbey
church
above
unless
it
is
the
north
fleche
of
chartres
cathedral
and
if
you
will
look
down
the
nave
through
the
triumphal
arches
into
the
pointed
choir
four
hundred
years
more
modern
you
can
judge
whether
there
is
any
real
discord
for
those
who
feel
the
art
there
is
none
the
strength
and
the
grace
join
hands
the
man
and
woman
love
each
other
still
the
difference
of
sex
is
not
imaginary
in
when
the
triumphal
columns
were
building
and
taillefer
sang
to
william
the
bastard
and
harold
the
saxon
roland
still
prayed
his
mea
culpa
to
god
the
father
and
gave
not
a
thought
to
alda
his
betrothed
in
the
twelfth
century
saint
bernard
recited
ave
stella
marts
in
an
ecstasy
of
miracle
before
the
image
of
the
virgin
and
the
armies
of
france
in
battle
cried
what
the
roman
could
not
express
flowered
into
the
gothic
what
the
masculine
mind
could
not
idealize
in
the
warrior
it
idealized
in
the
woman
no
architecture
that
ever
grew
on
earth
except
the
gothic
gave
this
effect
of
flinging
its
passion
against
the
sky
when
men
no
longer
felt
the
passion
they
fell
back
on
themselves
or
lower
the
architect
returned
to
the
round
arch
and
even
further
to
the
flatness
of
the
greek
colonnade
but
this
was
not
the
fault
of
the
twelfth
or
thirteenth
centuries
what
they
had
to
say
they
said
what
they
felt
they
expressed
and
if
the
seventeenth
century
forgot
it
the
twentieth
in
turn
has
forgotten
the
seventeenth
history
is
only
a
catalogue
of
the
forgotten
the
eleventh
century
is
no
worse
off
than
its
neighbours
the
twelfth
is
in
architecture
rather
better
off
than
the
nineteenth
these
two
rooms
the
aquilon
and
promenoir
which
mark
the
beginning
of
the
transition
are
on
the
whole
more
modern
than
or
il
gesu
at
rome
in
the
same
situation
for
the
same
purposes
any
architect
would
be
proud
to
repeat
them
the
aquilon
though
a
hall
or
gallery
of
importance
in
its
day
seems
to
be
classed
among
crypts
camille
enlart
in
his
manual
of
french
archaeology
gives
a
list
of
romanesque
and
transition
crypts
about
one
hundred
and
twenty
to
serve
as
examples
for
the
study
the
aquilon
is
not
one
of
them
but
the
crypt
of
and
that
of
chartres
cathedral
would
serve
to
teach
any
tourist
all
that
he
should
want
to
know
about
such
matters
photographs
such
as
those
of
the
monuments
historiques
answer
all
the
just
purposes
of
underground
travel
the
aquilon
is
one
first
lesson
in
transition
architecture
because
it
is
dated
and
the
crypt
of
serves
almost
equally
well
because
the
abbe
suger
must
have
begun
his
plans
for
it
about
both
have
the
same
arcs
doubleaux
and
though
in
opposite
arrangement
both
show
the
first
heavy
hint
at
the
broken
arch
there
are
no
nervures
no
and
hardly
a
suggestion
of
the
gothic
as
one
sees
it
in
the
splendid
crypt
of
the
gros
fillers
close
at
hand
except
the
elaborately
intersecting
vaults
and
the
heavy
columns
but
the
promenoir
above
is
an
astonishing
leap
in
time
and
art
the
promenoir
has
the
same
arrangement
and
columns
as
the
aquilon
but
the
vaults
are
beautifully
arched
and
pointed
with
ribs
rising
directly
from
the
square
capitals
and
intersecting
the
central
spacings
in
a
spirit
which
neither
you
nor
i
know
how
to
distinguish
from
the
pure
gothic
of
the
thirteenth
century
unless
it
is
that
the
arches
are
hardly
pointed
enough
they
seem
to
the
eye
almost
round
the
height
appears
to
be
about
fourteen
feet
the
promenoir
of
abbot
roger
ii
has
an
interest
to
pilgrims
who
are
going
on
to
the
shrine
of
the
virgin
because
the
date
of
the
promenoir
seems
to
be
exactly
the
same
as
the
date
which
the
abbe
bulteau
assigns
for
the
western
portal
of
chartres
ordinarily
a
date
is
no
great
matter
but
when
one
has
to
run
forward
and
back
with
the
agility
of
an
electric
tram
between
two
or
three
fixed
points
it
is
convenient
to
fix
them
once
for
all
the
transition
is
complete
here
in
the
promenoir
which
was
planned
as
early
as
the
subject
of
vaulting
is
far
too
ambitious
for
summer
travel
it
is
none
too
easy
for
a
graduate
of
the
beaux
arts
and
few
architectural
fields
have
been
so
earnestly
discussed
and
disputed
we
must
not
touch
it
the
age
of
the
chanson
de
roland
itself
is
not
so
dangerous
a
topic
our
vital
needs
are
met
more
or
less
sufficiently
by
taking
the
promenoir
at
the
mount
the
crypt
at
and
the
western
portal
at
chartres
as
the
trinity
of
our
transition
and
roughly
calling
their
date
the
years
to
overload
the
memory
with
dates
is
the
vice
of
every
schoolmaster
and
the
passion
of
every
scholar
tourists
want
as
few
dates
as
possible
what
they
want
is
poetry
yet
a
singular
coincidence
with
which
every
classroom
is
only
too
familiar
has
made
of
the
years
a
curiously
convenient
group
and
the
year
is
as
convenient
as
any
for
the
beginning
of
the
century
of
transition
that
was
the
year
when
saint
bernard
laid
the
foundations
of
his
abbey
of
clairvaux
perhaps
or
at
latest
was
the
year
when
abelard
sang
to
heloise
in
canon
fulbert
house
in
the
rue
des
chantres
beside
the
cloister
of
notre
dame
in
paris
the
abbe
suger
the
abbe
bernard
and
the
abbe
abelard
are
the
three
interesting
men
of
the
french
transition
the
promenoir
then
shall
pass
for
the
year
and
as
such
is
an
exceedingly
beautiful
hall
uniting
the
splendid
calm
and
seriousness
of
the
romanesque
with
the
exquisite
lines
of
the
gothic
you
will
hardly
see
its
equal
in
the
twelfth
century
at
angers
the
great
hall
of
the
bishop
palace
survives
to
give
a
point
of
comparison
but
commonly
the
halls
of
that
date
were
not
vaulted
they
had
timber
roofs
and
have
perished
the
promenoir
is
about
sixty
feet
long
and
divided
into
two
aisles
ten
feet
wide
by
a
row
of
columns
if
it
were
used
on
great
occasions
as
a
refectory
eighty
or
a
hundred
persons
could
have
been
seated
at
table
and
perhaps
this
may
have
been
about
the
scale
of
the
needs
at
that
time
whatever
effort
of
fancy
was
needed
to
place
duke
william
and
harold
in
the
old
refectory
of
none
whatever
is
required
in
order
to
see
his
successors
in
the
halls
of
roger
ii
with
one
exception
they
were
not
interesting
persons
the
exception
was
henry
ii
of
england
and
anjou
and
his
wife
eleanor
of
guienne
who
was
for
a
while
regent
of
normandy
one
of
their
children
was
born
at
domfront
just
beyond
avranches
and
the
abbot
was
asked
to
be
godfather
in
just
one
hundred
years
after
duke
visit
king
henry
and
his
whole
suite
came
to
the
abbey
heard
mass
and
dined
in
the
refectory
rex

abbot
robert
of
torigny
was
his
host
and
very
possibly
william
of
looked
on
perhaps
he
recited
parts
of
his
roman
before
the
king
one
may
be
quite
sure
that
when
queen
eleanor
came
to
the
mount
she
asked
the
poet
to
recite
his
verses
for
eleanor
gave
law
to
poets
one
might
linger
over
abbot
robert
of
torigny
who
was
a
very
great
man
in
his
day
and
an
especially
great
architect
but
too
ambitious
all
his
work
including
the
two
towers
crumbled
and
fell
for
want
of
proper
support
what
would
correspond
to
the
cathedrals
of
noyon
and
soissons
and
the
old
clocher
and
fleche
of
chartres
is
lost
we
have
no
choice
but
to
step
down
into
the
next
century
at
once
and
into
the
full
and
perfect
gothic
of
the
great
age
when
the
new
chartres
was
building
in
the
year
philip
augustus
expelled
the
english
from
normandy
and
conquered
the
province
but
in
the
course
of
the
war
the
duke
of
brittany
who
was
naturally
a
party
to
any
war
that
took
place
under
his
eyes
happened
to
burn
the
town
beneath
the
abbey
and
in
doing
so
set
fire
unintentionally
to
the
abbey
itself
the
sacrilege
shocked
philip
augustus
and
the
wish
to
conciliate
so
powerful
a
vassal
as
saint
michel
or
his
abbot
led
the
king
of
france
to
give
a
large
sum
of
money
for
repairing
the
buildings
the
abbot
jordan
at
once
undertook
to
outdo
all
his
predecessors
and
with
an
immense
ambition
planned
the
huge
pile
which
covers
the
whole
north
face
of
the
mount
and
which
has
always
borne
the
expressive
name
of
the
merveille
the
general
motive
of
abbatial
building
was
common
to
them
all
abbeys
were
large
households
the
church
was
the
centre
and
at
the
summit
for
the
situation
compelled
the
abbots
there
to
pile
one
building
on
another
instead
of
arranging
them
on
a
level
in
squares
or
parallelograms
the
dormitory
in
any
case
had
to
be
near
a
door
of
the
church
because
the
rule
required
constant
services
day
and
night
the
cloister
was
also
the
church
door
and
at
the
mount
had
to
be
on
the
same
level
in
order
to
be
in
open
air
naturally
the
refectory
must
be
immediately
beneath
one
or
the
other
of
these
two
principal
structures
and
the
hall
or
place
of
meeting
for
business
with
the
outside
world
or
for
internal
administration
or
for
guests
of
importance
must
be
next
the
refectory
the
kitchen
and
offices
would
be
placed
on
the
lowest
stage
if
for
no
other
reason
because
the
magazines
were
two
hundred
feet
below
at
the
and
all
supplies
including
water
had
to
be
hauled
up
an
inclined
plane
by
windlass
to
administer
such
a
society
required
the
most
efficient
management
an
abbot
on
this
scale
was
a
very
great
man
indeed
who
enjoyed
an
establishment
of
his
own
close
by
with
officers
in
no
small
number
for
the
monks
alone
numbered
sixty
and
even
these
were
not
enough
for
the
regular
church
services
at
seasons
of
pilgrimage
the
abbot
was
obliged
to
entertain
scores
and
hundreds
of
guests
and
these
too
of
the
highest
importance
with
large
suites
every
ounce
of
food
must
be
brought
from
the
mainland
or
fished
from
the
sea
all
the
tenants
and
their
farms
their
rents
and
contributions
must
be
looked
after
no
secular
prince
had
a
more
serious
task
of
administration
and
none
did
it
so
well
tenants
always
preferred
an
abbot
or
bishop
for
landlord
the
abbey
was
the
highest
administrative
creation
of
the
middle
ages
and
when
one
has
made
one
pilgrimage
to
chartres
one
might
well
devote
another
summer
to
visiting
what
is
left
of
clairvaux
citeaux
cluny
and
the
other
famous
monasteries
with
to
guide
in
order
to
satisfy
one
mind
whether
on
the
whole
such
a
life
may
not
have
had
activity
as
well
as
idleness
this
is
a
matter
of
economics
to
be
settled
with
the
keepers
of
more
modern
hotels
but
the
art
had
to
suit
the
conditions
and
when
abbot
jordan
decided
to
plaster
this
huge
structure
against
the
side
of
the
mount
the
architect
had
a
relatively
simple
task
to
handle
the
engineering
difficulties
alone
were
very
serious
the
architectural
plan
was
plain
enough
as
the
abbot
laid
his
requirements
before
the
architect
he
seems
to
have
begun
by
fixing
the
scale
for
a
refectory
capable
of
seating
two
hundred
guests
at
table
probably
no
king
in
europe
fed
more
persons
at
his
table
than
this
according
to
corroyer
plan
the
length
of
the
new
refectory
is
one
hundred
and
feet
metres
a
row
of
columns
down
the
centre
divides
it
into
two
aisles
measuring
twelve
feet
clear
from
column
to
column
across
the
room
if
tables
were
set
the
whole
length
of
the
two
aisles
forty
persons
could
have
been
easily
seated
in
four
rows
or
one
hundred
and
sixty
persons
without
crowding
the
same
space
would
give
room
for
fifty
guests
or
two
hundred
in
all
once
the
scale
was
fixed
the
arrangement
was
easy
beginning
at
the
lowest
possible
level
one
plain
very
solidly
built
vaulted
room
served
as
foundation
for
another
loftier
and
more
delicately
vaulted
and
this
again
bore
another
which
stood
on
the
level
of
the
church
and
opened
directly
into
the
north
transept
this
arrangement
was
then
doubled
and
the
second
set
of
rooms
at
the
west
end
contained
the
cellar
on
the
lower
level
another
great
room
or
hall
above
it
and
the
cloister
at
the
church
door
also
entering
into
the
north
transept
doorways
passages
and
stairs
unite
them
all
the
two
heavy
halls
on
the
lowest
level
are
now
called
the
almonry
and
the
cellar
which
is
a
distinction
between
administrative
arrangements
that
does
not
concern
us
architecturally
the
rooms
might
to
our
untrained
eyes
be
of
the
same
age
with
the
aquilon
they
are
earliest
transition
as
far
as
a
tourist
can
see
or
at
least
they
belong
to
the
class
of
crypts
which
has
an
architecture
of
its
own
the
rooms
that
concern
us
are
those
immediately
above
the
salle
des
chevaliers
at
the
west
end
and
the
refectory
at
the
east
every
writer
gives
these
rooms
different
names
and
assigns
them
different
purposes
but
whatever
they
were
meant
for
they
are
as
halls
the
finest
in
france
the
purest
in
perfection
the
salle
des
chevaliers
of
the
order
of
saint
michael
created
by
louis
xi
in
was
or
shall
be
for
tourist
purposes
the
great
hall
that
every
palace
and
castle
contained
and
in
which
the
life
of
the
chateau
centred
planned
at
about
the
same
time
with
the
cathedral
of
chartres
and
before
the
abbey
church
of
this
hall
and
its
neighbour
the
refectory
studied
together
with
the
cathedral
and
the
abbey
are
an
exceedingly
liberal
education
for
anybody
tourist
or
engineer
or
architect
and
would
make
the
fortune
of
an
intelligent
historian
if
such
should
happen
to
exist
but
the
last
thing
we
ask
from
them
is
education
or
instruction
we
want
only
their
poetry
and
shall
have
to
look
for
it
elsewhere
here
is
only
the
shell
the
dead
art
and
silence
the
hall
is
about
ninety
feet
long
and
sixty
feet
in
its
greatest
width
it
has
three
ranges
of
columns
making
four
vaulted
aisles
which
seem
to
rise
about
feet
in
height
it
is
warmed
by
two
huge
and
heavy
cheminees
or
fireplaces
in
the
outside
wall
between
the
windows
it
is
lighted
beautifully
but
mostly
from
above
through
round
windows
in
the
arching
of
the
vaults
the
vaulting
is
a
study
for
wiser
men
than
we
can
ever
be
more
than
twenty
strong
round
columns
free
or
engaged
with
romanesque
capitals
support
heavy
ribs
or
nervures
and
while
the
two
central
aisles
are
eighteen
feet
wide
the
outside
aisle
into
which
the
windows
open
measures
only
ten
feet
in
width
and
has
consequently
one
of
the
most
sharply
pointed
vaults
we
shall
ever
meet
the
whole
design
is
as
beautiful
a
bit
of
early
gothic
as
exists
but
what
would
take
most
time
to
study
if
time
were
to
spare
would
be
the
instinct
of
the
archangel
presence
which
has
animated
his
architecture
the
masculine
military
energy
of
saint
michael
lives
still
in
every
stone
the
genius
that
realized
this
warlike
emotion
has
stamped
his
power
everywhere
on
every
centimetre
of
his
work
in
every
ray
of
light
on
the
mass
of
every
shadow
wherever
the
eye
falls
still
more
strongly
on
all
that
the
eye
divines
and
in
the
shadows
that
are
felt
like
the
lights
the
architect
intended
it
all
any
one
who
doubts
has
only
to
step
through
the
doorway
in
the
corner
into
the
refectory
there
the
architect
has
undertaken
to
express
the
idea
of
the
archangel
he
has
left
the
twelfth
century
behind
him
the
refectory
which
has
already
served
for
a
measure
of
the
scale
is
in
feeling
as
different
as
possible
from
the
hall
six
charming
columns
run
down
the
centre
dividing
the
room
into
two
vaulted
aisles
apparently
about
feet
in
height
wherever
the
hall
was
heavy
and
serious
the
refectory
was
made
light
and
graceful
hardly
a
trace
of
the
romanesque
remains
only
the
slight
round
columns
are
not
yet
grooved
or
fluted
and
their
round
capitals
are
still
slightly
severe
every
detail
is
lightened
the
great
fireplaces
are
removed
to
each
end
of
the
room
the
most
interesting
change
is
in
the
windows
when
you
reach
chartres
the
great
book
of
architecture
will
open
on
the
word
fenestration
fenestre
a
word
as
ugly
as
the
thing
was
beautiful
and
then
with
pain
and
sorrow
you
will
have
to
toil
till
you
see
how
the
architects
of
subordinated
every
other
problem
to
that
of
lighting
their
spaces
without
feeling
their
lights
you
can
never
feel
their
shadows
these
two
halls
at
are
antechambers
to
the
nave
of
chartres
their
fenestration
inside
and
out
controls
the
whole
design
the
lighting
of
the
refectory
is
superb
but
one
feels
its
value
in
art
only
when
it
is
taken
in
relation
to
the
lighting
of
the
hall
and
both
serve
as
a
simple
preamble
to
the
romance
of
the
chartres
windows
the
refectory
shows
what
the
architect
did
when
to
lighten
his
effects
he
wanted
to
use
every
possible
square
centimetre
of
light
he
has
made
nine
windows
six
on
the
north
two
on
the
east
and
one
on
the
south
they
are
nearly
five
feet
wide
and
about
twenty
feet
high
they
flood
the
room
probably
they
were
intended
for
glass
and
corroyer
volume
contains
of
a
few
fragments
of
glass
discovered
in
his
various
excavations
but
one
may
take
for
granted
that
with
so
much
light
colour
was
the
object
intended
the
floors
would
be
tiled
in
colour
the
walls
would
be
hung
with
colour
probably
the
vaults
were
painted
in
colour
one
can
see
it
all
in
scores
of
illuminated
manuscripts
the
thirteenth
century
had
a
passion
for
colour
and
made
a
of
its
own
which
we
have
got
to
explore
the
two
halls
remain
almost
the
only
monuments
of
what
must
be
called
secular
architecture
of
the
early
and
perfect
period
of
gothic
art
churches
enough
remain
with
chartres
at
their
head
but
all
the
great
abbeys
palaces
and
chateaux
of
that
day
are
ruins
arques
gaillard
montargis
coucy
the
old
louvre
chinon
angers
as
well
as
cluny
clairvaux
citeaux
jumieges
vezelay
poissy
fontevrault
and
a
score
of
other
residences
royal
or
have
disappeared
wholly
or
have
lost
their
residential
buildings
when
under
the
second
empire
was
allowed
to
restore
one
great
chateau
he
chose
the
latest
pierrefonds
built
by
louis
in
vestiges
of
saint
louis
palace
remain
at
the
conciergerie
but
the
first
great
royal
residence
to
be
compared
with
the
merveille
is
amboise
dating
from
about
three
centuries
later
civilization
made
almost
a
clean
sweep
of
art
only
here
at
one
may
still
sit
at
ease
on
the
stone
benches
in
the
embrasures
of
the
refectory
windows
looking
over
the
ocean
and
watching
the
architect
as
he
worked
out
the
details
which
were
to
produce
or
accent
his
contrasts
or
harmonies
heighten
his
effects
or
hide
his
show
of
effort
and
all
by
means
so
true
simpler
and
apparently
easy
that
one
seems
almost
competent
to
follow
him
one
learns
better
in
time
one
gets
to
feel
that
these
things
were
due
in
part
to
an
instinct
that
the
architect
himself
might
not
have
been
able
to
explain
the
instinct
vanishes
as
time
creeps
on
the
halls
at
rouen
or
at
blois
are
more
easily
understood
the
salle
des
caryatides
of
pierre
lescot
at
the
louvre
charming
as
it
is
is
simpler
still
and
one
feels
entirely
at
home
in
the
salle
des
glaces
which
filled
the
ambition
of
louis
xiv
at
versailles
if
any
lingering
doubt
remains
in
regard
to
the
professional
cleverness
of
the
architect
and
the
thoroughness
of
his
study
we
had
best
return
to
the
great
hall
and
pass
through
a
low
door
in
its
extreme
outer
angle
up
a
few
steps
into
a
little
room
some
thirteen
feet
square
beautifully
vaulted
lighted
warmed
by
a
large
stone
fireplace
and
in
the
corner
a
spiral
staircase
leading
up
to
another
square
room
above
opening
directly
into
the
cloister
it
is
a
little
library
or
the
arrangement
is
almost
too
clever
for
gravity
as
is
the
case
with
more
than
one
arrangement
in
the
merveille
from
the
outside
one
can
see
that
at
this
corner
the
architect
had
to
provide
a
heavy
buttress
against
a
double
strain
and
he
built
up
from
the
rock
below
a
square
corner
tower
as
support
into
which
he
worked
a
spiral
staircase
leading
from
the
cellar
up
to
the
cloisters
just
above
the
level
of
the
great
hall
he
managed
to
construct
this
little
room
a
gem
the
place
was
near
and
far
it
was
quiet
and
central
william
of
pair
had
he
been
still
alive
might
have
written
his
roman
there
monks
might
have
illuminated
missals
there
a
few
steps
upward
brought
them
to
the
cloisters
for
meditation
a
few
more
brought
them
to
the
church
for
prayer
a
few
steps
downward
brought
them
to
the
great
hall
for
business
a
few
steps
more
led
them
into
the
refectory
for
dinner
to
contemplate
the
goodness
of
god
was
a
simple
joy
when
one
had
such
a
room
to
work
in
such
a
spot
as
the
great
hall
to
walk
in
when
the
storms
blew
or
the
cloisters
in
which
to
meditate
when
the
sun
shone
such
a
as
the
refectory
and
such
a
view
from
one
windows
over
the
infinite
ocean
and
the
guiles
of
satan
quicksands
from
the
battlements
of
heaven
william
of
looked
down
on
it
with
envy
of
all
parts
of
the
merveille
in
summer
the
most
charming
must
always
have
been
the
cloisters
only
the
abbey
of
the
mount
was
rich
and
splendid
enough
to
build
a
cloister
like
this
all
in
granite
carved
in
forms
as
light
as
though
it
were
wood
with
columns
arranged
in
a
peculiar
triangular
order
that
excited
the
admiration
of
one
of
the
most
curious
and
complete
cloisters
that
we
have
in
france
he
said
although
in
france
there
are
many
beautiful
and
curious
cloisters
for
another
reason
it
has
value
the
architect
meant
it
to
reassert
with
all
the
art
and
grace
he
could
command
the
mastery
of
love
of
thought
and
poetry
in
religion
over
the
masculine
military
energy
of
the
great
hall
below
the
thirteenth
century
rarely
let
slip
a
chance
to
insist
on
this
moral
that
love
is
law
saint
francis
was
preaching
to
the
birds
in
at
assisi
and
the
architect
built
this
cloister
in
at
both
sermons
were
saturated
with
the
feeling
of
the
time
and
both
are
about
equally
worth
noting
if
one
aspires
to
feel
the
art
a
conscientious
student
has
yet
to
climb
down
the
many
steps
on
the
outside
and
look
up
at
the
merveille
from
below
few
buildings
in
france
are
better
worth
the
trouble
the
horizontal
line
at
the
roof
measures
two
hundred
and
feet
the
vertical
line
of
the
buttresses
measures
in
round
numbers
one
hundred
feet
to
make
walls
of
that
height
and
length
stand
up
at
all
was
no
easy
matter
as
robert
de
torigny
had
shown
and
so
the
architect
buttressed
them
from
bottom
to
top
with
twelve
long
buttresses
against
the
thrust
of
the
interior
arches
and
three
more
bearing
against
the
interior
walls
this
gives
on
the
north
front
fifteen
strong
vertical
lines
in
a
space
of
two
hundred
and
feet
between
these
lines
the
windows
tell
their
story
the
seven
long
windows
of
the
refectory
on
one
side
the
seven
rounded
windows
of
the
hall
on
the
other
even
the
corner
tower
with
the
becomes
as
simple
as
the
rest
the
sum
of
this
impossible
wall
and
its
exaggerated
vertical
lines
is
strength
and
intelligence
at
rest
the
whole
mount
still
kept
the
grand
style
it
expressed
the
unity
of
church
and
state
god
and
man
peace
and
war
life
and
death
good
and
bad
it
solved
the
whole
problem
of
the
universe
the
priest
and
the
soldier
were
both
at
home
here
in
as
in
or
in
the
politician
was
not
outside
of
it
the
sinner
was
welcome
the
poet
was
made
happy
in
his
own
spirit
with
a
sympathy
almost
an
affection
that
suggests
a
habit
of
verse
in
the
abbot
as
well
as
in
the
architect
god
reconciles
all
the
world
is
an
evident
obvious
sacred
harmony
even
the
discord
of
war
is
a
detail
on
which
the
abbey
refuses
to
insist
not
till
two
centuries
afterwards
did
the
mount
take
on
the
modern
expression
of
war
as
a
discord
in
god
providence
then
in
the
early
years
of
the
fifteenth
century
abbot
pierre
le
roy
plastered
the
gate
of
the
chatelet
as
you
now
see
it
over
the
sunny
entrance
called
belle
chaise
which
had
treated
mere
military
construction
with
a
sort
of
quiet
contempt
you
will
know
what
a
chatelet
is
when
you
meet
another
it
frowns
in
a
spirit
quite
alien
to
the
twelfth
century
it
jars
on
the
religion
of
the
place
it
forebodes
wars
of
religion
dissolution
of
society
loss
of
unity
the
end
of
a
world
nothing
is
sadder
than
the
catastrophe
of
gothic
art
religion
and
hope
one
looks
back
on
it
all
as
a
picture
a
symbol
of
unity
an
assertion
of
god
and
man
in
a
bolder
stronger
closer
union
than
ever
was
expressed
by
other
art
and
when
the
idea
is
absorbed
accepted
and
perhaps
partially
understood
one
may
move
on
chapter
iv
normandy
and
the
ile
de
france
from
the
architectural
road
leads
across
normandy
up
the
seine
to
paris
and
not
directly
through
chartres
which
lies
a
little
to
the
south
in
the
empire
of
architecture
normandy
was
one
kingdom
brittany
another
the
ile
de
france
with
paris
was
a
third
touraine
and
the
valley
of
the
loire
were
a
fourth
and
in
the
centre
the
between
them
all
lay
the
counties
of
chartres
and
dreux
before
going
to
chartres
one
should
go
up
the
seine
and
down
the
loire
from
angers
to
le
mans
and
so
enter
chartres
from
brittany
after
a
complete
circle
but
if
we
set
out
to
do
our
pleasure
on
that
scale
we
must
start
from
the
pyramid
of
cheops
we
have
set
out
from
we
will
go
next
to
paris
the
architectural
highway
lies
through
coutances
bayeux
caen
rouen
and
mantes
every
great
artistic
kingdom
solved
its
architectural
problems
in
its
own
way
as
it
did
its
religious
political
and
social
problems
and
no
two
solutions
were
ever
quite
the
same
but
among
them
the
norman
was
commonly
the
most
practical
and
sometimes
the
most
dignified
we
can
test
this
rule
by
the
standard
of
the
first
town
we
stop
at
coutances
we
can
test
it
equally
well
at
bayeux
or
caen
but
coutances
comes
first
after
let
us
begin
with
it
and
state
the
problems
with
their
norman
solution
so
that
it
may
be
ready
at
hand
to
compare
with
the
french
solution
before
coming
to
the
solution
at
chartres
the
cathedral
at
coutances
is
said
to
be
about
the
age
of
the
merveille
but
the
exact
dates
are
unknown
and
the
work
is
so
norman
as
to
stand
by
itself
yet
the
architect
has
grappled
with
more
problems
than
one
need
hope
to
see
solved
in
any
single
church
in
the
tie
de
france
even
at
chartres
although
the
two
stone
fleches
are
by
exception
completed
they
are
not
of
the
same
age
as
they
are
here
neither
at
chartres
nor
at
paris
nor
at
laon
or
amiens
or
rheims
or
bourges
will
you
see
a
central
tower
to
compare
with
the
enormous
pile
at
coutances
indeed
the
architects
of
france
failed
to
solve
this
particular
church
problem
and
shall
leave
it
behind
us
in
leaving
normandy
although
it
is
the
most
effective
feature
of
any
possible
church
a
clocher
of
that
period
circa
built
over
the
croisee
of
a
cathedral
following
lines
so
happy
should
be
a
monument
of
the
greatest
beauty
unfortunately
we
possess
not
a
single
one
in
france
fire
and
the
hand
of
man
more
than
time
have
destroyed
them
all
and
we
find
on
our
greatest
religious
edifices
no
more
than
bases
and
fragments
of
these
beautiful
constructions
the
cathedral
of
coutances
alone
has
preserved
its
central
clocher
of
the
thirteenth
century
and
even
there
it
is
not
complete
its
stone
fleche
is
wanting
as
for
its
style
it
belongs
to
norman
architecture
and
diverges
widely
from
the
character
of
french
architecture
so
says
but
although
the
great
churches
for
the
most
part
never
had
central
clochers
which
on
the
scale
of
amiens
bourges
or
beauvais
would
have
required
an
impossible
mass
the
smaller
churches
frequently
carry
them
still
and
they
are
like
the
dome
the
most
effective
features
they
can
carry
they
were
made
to
dominate
the
whole
no
doubt
the
fleche
is
wanting
at
coutances
but
you
can
supply
it
in
imagination
from
the
two
fleches
of
the
western
tower
which
are
as
simple
and
severe
as
the
spear
of
a
supply
the
fleche
and
the
meaning
of
the
tower
can
not
be
mistaken
it
is
as
military
as
the
chanson
de
roland
it
is
the
himself
mounted
and
ready
for
battle
spear
in
rest
the
mere
seat
of
the
central
tower
astride
of
the
church
so
firm
so
fixed
so
serious
so
defiant
is
norman
like
the
seat
of
the
abbey
church
on
the
mount
and
at
falaise
where
william
the
bastard
was
born
we
shall
see
a
central
tower
on
the
church
which
is
william
himself
in
armour
on
horseback
ready
to
fight
for
the
church
and
perhaps
in
his
bad
moods
against
it
such
militant
churches
were
capable
of
forcing
heaven
itself
all
of
them
look
as
though
they
had
fought
at
hastings
or
stormed
jerusalem
wherever
the
norman
central
clocher
stands
the
church
militant
of
the
eleventh
century
survives
not
the
church
of
mary
queen
but
of
michael
the
archangel
not
the
church
of
christ
but
of
god
the
father
who
never
lied
taken
together
with
the
fleches
of
the
facade
this
clocher
of
coutances
forms
a
group
such
as
one
very
seldom
sees
the
two
towers
of
the
facade
are
something
apart
quite
by
themselves
among
the
innumerable
of
the
gothic
time
we
have
got
a
happy
summer
before
us
merely
in
looking
for
these
there
is
no
livelier
amusement
for
fine
weather
than
in
hunting
them
as
though
they
were
mushrooms
and
no
study
in
architecture
nearly
so
delightful
no
work
of
man
has
life
like
the
fleche
one
sees
it
for
a
greater
distance
and
feels
it
for
a
longer
time
than
is
possible
with
any
other
human
structure
unless
it
be
the
dome
there
is
more
play
of
light
on
the
octagonal
faces
of
the
fleche
as
the
sun
moves
around
them
than
can
be
got
out
of
the
square
or
the
cone
or
any
other
combination
of
surfaces
for
some
reason
the
facets
of
the
hexagon
or
octagon
are
more
pleasing
than
the
rounded
surfaces
of
the
cone
and
normandy
is
said
to
be
peculiarly
the
home
of
this
particularly
gothic
church
ornament
yet
clochers
and
fleches
are
scattered
all
over
france
until
one
gets
to
look
for
them
on
the
horizon
as
though
every
church
in
every
hamlet
were
an
architectural
monument
hundreds
of
them
literally
are
so
monuments
historiques
by
the
government
but
when
you
undertake
to
compare
them
or
to
decide
whether
they
are
more
beautiful
in
normandy
than
in
the
ile
de
france
or
in
burgundy
or
on
the
loire
or
the
charente
you
are
lost
even
the
superiority
of
the
octagon
is
not
evident
to
every
one
over
the
little
church
at
fenioux
on
the
charente
not
very
far
from
la
rochelle
is
a
conical
steeple
that
an
infidel
might
adore
and
if
you
have
to
decide
between
provinces
you
must
reckon
with
the
decision
of
architects
and
amateurs
who
seem
to
be
agreed
that
the
first
of
all
filches
is
at
chartres
the
second
at
vendome
not
far
from
blois
in
touraine
and
the
third
at
auxerre
in
burgundy
the
towers
of
coutances
are
not
in
the
list
nor
are
those
at
bayeux
nor
those
at
caen
france
is
rich
in
art
yet
the
towers
of
coutances
are
in
some
ways
as
interesting
if
not
as
beautiful
as
the
best
the
two
stone
fleches
here
with
their
octagon
faces
do
not
descend
as
in
other
churches
to
their
on
a
square
tower
with
the
plan
of
junction
more
or
less
disguised
they
throw
out
nests
of
smaller
fleches
and
these
cover
buttressing
corner
towers
with
lines
that
go
directly
to
the
ground
whether
the
artist
consciously
intended
it
or
not
the
effect
is
to
broaden
the
facade
and
lift
it
into
the
air
the
facade
itself
has
a
distinctly
military
look
as
though
a
fortress
had
been
altered
into
a
church
a
charming
arcade
at
the
top
has
the
air
of
being
thrown
across
in
order
to
disguise
the
alteration
and
perhaps
owes
much
of
its
charm
to
the
contrast
it
makes
with
the
severity
of
military
lines
even
the
great
west
window
looks
like
an
afterthought
one
instinct
asks
for
a
blank
wall
yet
from
the
ground
up
to
the
cross
on
the
spire
one
feels
the
norman
nature
throughout
animating
the
whole
uniting
it
all
and
crowding
into
it
an
intelligent
variety
of
original
motives
that
would
build
a
dozen
churches
of
late
gothic
nothing
about
it
is
stereotyped
or
conventional
not
even
the
conventionality
if
you
have
any
doubts
about
this
you
have
only
to
compare
the
photograph
of
coutances
with
the
photograph
of
chartres
and
yet
surely
the
facade
of
chartres
is
severe
enough
to
satisfy
saint
bernard
himself
with
the
later
fronts
of
rheims
and
amiens
there
is
no
field
for
comparison
they
have
next
to
nothing
in
common
yet
coutances
is
said
to
be
of
the
same
date
with
rheims
or
nearly
so
and
one
can
believe
it
when
one
enters
the
interior
the
normans
as
they
slowly
reveal
themselves
disclose
most
unexpected
qualities
one
seems
to
sound
subterranean
caverns
of
feeling
hidden
behind
their
iron
nasals
no
other
cathedral
in
france
or
in
europe
has
an
interior
more
refined
one
is
tempted
to
use
even
the
adjective
more
tender
or
more
carefully
studied
one
test
is
crucial
here
and
everywhere
the
treatment
of
the
apse
and
choir
is
the
architect
severest
standard
this
is
a
subject
not
to
be
touched
lightly
one
to
which
we
shall
have
to
come
back
in
a
humble
spirit
prepared
for
patient
study
at
chartres
but
the
choir
of
coutances
is
a
cousin
to
that
of
chartres
as
the
facades
are
cousins
coutances
like
chartres
belongs
to
notre
dame
and
is
felt
in
the
same
spirit
the
church
is
built
for
the
choir
and
apse
rather
than
for
the
nave
and
transepts
for
the
virgin
rather
than
for
the
public
in
one
respect
coutances
is
even
more
delicate
in
the
feminine
charm
of
the
virgin
peculiar
grace
than
chartres
but
this
was
an
afterthought
of
the
fourteenth
century
the
system
of
chapels
radiating
about
the
apse
was
extended
down
the
nave
in
an
arrangement
so
beautiful
and
so
rare
according
to
that
one
shall
seek
far
before
finding
its
equal
among
the
unexpected
revelations
of
human
nature
that
suddenly
astonish
historians
one
of
the
least
reasonable
was
the
passionate
outbreak
of
religious
devotion
to
the
ideal
of
feminine
grace
charity
and
love
that
took
place
here
in
normandy
while
it
was
still
a
part
of
the
english
kingdom
and
flamed
up
into
almost
fanatical
frenzy
among
the
most
and
race
in
europe
so
in
this
church
in
the
centre
of
this
arrangement
of
apse
and
chapels
with
their
quite
unusual
perhaps
quite
singular
grace
the
four
huge
piers
which
support
the
enormous
central
tower
offer
a
tour
de
force
almost
as
exceptional
as
the
refinement
of
the
chapels
at
among
the
monks
the
union
of
strength
and
grace
was
striking
but
at
coutances
it
is
exaggerated
like
tristram
and
iseult
a
roman
of
chivalry
the
four
enormous
columns
of
the
croisee
carry
as
says
the
enormous
octagonal
tower
like
saint
christopher
supporting
the
child
before
the
image
of
the
virgin
in
her
honour
nothing
like
this
can
be
seen
at
chartres
or
at
any
of
the
later
palaces
which
france
built
for
the
pleasure
of
the
queen
of
heaven
we
are
slipping
into
the
thirteenth
century
again
the
temptation
is
terrible
to
feeble
minds
and
tourist
natures
but
a
great
mass
of
twelfth
and
work
remains
to
be
seen
and
felt
to
go
back
is
not
so
easy
as
to
begin
with
it
the
heavy
round
arch
is
like
old
cognac
compared
with
the
champagne
of
the
pointed
and
fretted
spire
one
must
not
quit
coutances
without
making
an
excursion
to
lessayon
the
road
to
cherbourg
where
is
a
church
of
the
twelfth
century
with
a
square
tower
and
almost
untouched
norman
interior
that
closely
repeats
the
abbey
church
at
michel
one
of
the
most
complete
models
of
romanesque
architecture
to
be
found
in
normandy
says
de
caumont
the
central
clocher
will
begin
a
photographic
collection
of
square
towers
to
replace
that
which
was
lost
on
the
mount
and
a
second
example
is
near
bayeux
at
a
small
place
called
where
the
church
matches
that
on
the
mount
according
to
corroyer
for
foret
was
also
an
abbey
and
the
church
built
by
richard
ii
duke
of
normandy
at
the
beginning
of
the
eleventh
century
was
larger
than
that
on
the
mount
it
still
keeps
its
central
tower
all
this
is
intensely
norman
and
is
going
to
help
very
little
in
france
it
would
be
more
useful
in
england
but
at
bayeux
is
a
great
cathedral
much
more
to
the
purpose
with
two
superb
western
towers
crowned
by
stone
fleches
cousins
of
those
at
coutances
and
distinctly
related
to
the
fleche
at
chartres
the
normans
says
had
not
that
instinct
of
proportion
which
the
architects
of
the
ile
de
france
beauvais
and
soissons
possessed
to
a
high
degree
yet
the
boldness
of
their
constructions
their
perfect
execution
the
elevation
of
the
fleches
had
evident
influence
on
the
french
school
properly
called
and
that
influence
is
felt
in
the
old
spire
of
chartres
the
norman
seemed
to
show
distinction
in
another
respect
which
the
french
were
less
quick
to
imitate
what
they
began
they
completed
not
one
of
the
great
french
churches
has
two
stone
spires
complete
of
the
same
age
while
each
of
the
little
towns
of
coutances
bayeux
and
caen
contains
its
twin
towers
and
fleches
of
stone
as
solid
and
perfect
now
as
they
were
seven
hundred
years
ago
still
another
norman
character
is
worth
noting
because
this
is
one
part
of
the
influence
felt
at
chartres
if
you
look
carefully
at
the
two
western
towers
of
the
bayeux
cathedral
perhaps
you
will
feel
what
is
said
to
be
the
strength
of
the
way
they
are
built
up
they
rise
from
their
foundation
with
a
quiet
confidence
of
line
and
support
which
passes
directly
up
to
the
on
the
summit
of
the
fleches
at
the
plane
where
the
square
tower
is
changed
into
the
octagon
spire
you
will
see
the
corner
turrets
and
the
long
intermediate
windows
which
effect
the
change
without
disguising
it
one
can
hardly
call
it
a
device
it
is
so
simple
and
evident
a
piece
of
construction
that
it
does
not
need
to
be
explained
yet
you
will
have
to
carry
a
photograph
of
this
fleche
to
chartres
and
from
there
to
vendome
for
there
is
to
be
a
great
battle
of
fleches
about
this
point
of
junction
and
the
norman
scheme
is
a
sort
of
standing
reproach
to
the
french
coutances
and
bayeux
are
interesting
but
caen
is
a
romanesque
mecca
there
william
the
conqueror
dealt
with
the
same
architectural
problems
and
put
his
solution
in
his
which
bears
the
name
of
saint
stephen
queen
matilda
put
her
solution
into
her
the
church
of
the
trinity
one
ought
particularly
to
look
at
the
beautiful
central
clocher
of
the
church
at
vaucelles
in
the
suburbs
and
one
must
drive
out
to
thaon
to
see
its
century
church
with
a
charming
romanesque
blind
arcade
on
the
outside
and
a
little
clocher
the
more
interesting
to
us
according
to
because
it
bears
the
stamp
of
the
traditions
of
defence
of
the
primitive
towers
which
were
built
over
the
porches
even
a
sort
of
chemin
de
ronde
remains
around
the
clocher
perhaps
once
provided
with
a
parapet
of
defence
la
du
reste
un
charmant
edifice
a
tower
with
stone
fleche
which
actually
served
for
defence
in
a
famous
recorded
instance
is
that
of
the
church
at
secqueville
not
far
off
this
beautiful
tower
as
charming
as
anything
in
norman
art
is
known
to
have
served
as
a
fortress
in
which
gives
a
valuable
date
the
pretty
old
romanesque
front
of
the
little
church
at
ouistreham
with
its
portal
that
seems
to
come
fresh
from
poitiers
and
moissac
can
be
taken
in
while
driving
past
but
we
must
on
no
account
fail
to
make
a
serious
pilgrimage
to
where
the
and
fleche
are
not
only
classed
among
the
best
in
normandy
but
have
an
exact
date
and
a
very
close
relation
with
chartres
as
will
appear
finally
if
for
no
other
reason
at
least
for
interest
in
arlette
the
tanner
daughter
one
must
go
to
falaise
and
look
at
the
superb
clocher
of
which
was
finished
and
consecrated
by
some
day
if
you
like
we
can
follow
this
romanesque
style
to
the
south
and
on
even
to
italy
where
it
may
be
supposed
to
have
been
born
but
france
had
an
architectural
life
fully
a
thousand
years
old
when
these
churches
were
built
and
was
long
since
artistically
as
she
was
politically
independent
the
normans
were
new
in
france
but
not
the
romanesque
architecture
they
only
took
the
forms
and
stamped
on
them
their
own
character
it
is
the
stamp
we
want
to
distinguish
in
order
to
trace
up
our
lines
of
artistic
ancestry
the
norman
stamp
was
not
easily
effaced
if
we
have
not
seen
enough
of
it
at
coutances
bayeux
and
caen
we
can
go
to
rouen
and
drive
out
to
boscherville
and
visit
the
ruined
abbey
of
jumieges
wherever
there
is
a
with
a
tall
fleche
as
at
boscherville
secqueville
caen
and
bayeux
duc
bids
notice
how
the
octagonal
steeple
is
fitted
on
to
the
square
tower
always
the
passage
from
the
octagon
to
the
square
seems
to
be
quite
simply
made
the
gothic
or
romanesque
spire
had
the
advantage
that
a
wooden
fleche
was
as
reasonable
a
covering
for
it
as
a
stone
one
and
the
normans
might
have
indulged
in
freaks
of
form
very
easily
if
they
chose
but
they
seem
never
to
have
thought
of
it
the
nearest
approach
to
the
freedom
of
wooden
roofs
is
not
in
the
lofty
fleches
but
in
the
covering
of
the
great
square
central
towers
like
falaise
or
vaucelles
a
huge
roof
which
tries
to
be
a
fleche
and
is
as
massive
as
the
heavy
structure
it
covers
the
last
of
the
norman
towers
that
insists
upon
is
the
clocher
de
the
northern
tower
on
the
west
front
of
the
cathedral
of
rouen
unfortunately
it
has
lost
its
primitive
octagon
fleche
if
it
ever
had
one
but
the
tower
remains
entire
and
according
to
is
certainly
one
of
the
most
beautiful
in
this
part
of
france
it
offers
a
mixture
of
the
two
styles
of
the
ile
de
france
and
of
normandy
in
which
the
former
element
dominates
it
is
of
the
same
date
as
the
old
tower
of
chartres
and
follows
the
same
interior
arrangement
but
here
the
petty
confused
disposition
of
the
norman
towers
with
their
division
into
stories
of
equal
height
has
been
adopted
by
the
french
master
builder
although
in
submitting
to
these
local
customs
he
has
still
thrown
over
his
work
the
grace
and
finesse
the
study
of
detail
the
sobriety
in
projections
the
perfect
harmony
between
the
profiles
sculpture
and
the
general
effect
of
the
whole
which
belong
to
the
school
he
came
from
he
has
managed
his
voids
and
solids
with
especial
cleverness
giving
the
more
importance
to
the
voids
and
enlarging
the
scale
of
his
details
as
the
tower
rose
in
height
these
details
have
great
beauty
the
construction
is
executed
in
materials
of
small
dimensions
with
the
care
that
the
architects
put
into
their
building
the
profiles
project
little
and
in
spite
of
their
extreme
finesse
produce
much
effect
the
buttresses
are
skilfully
planted
and
profiled
the
staircase
which
on
the
east
side
deranges
the
arrangement
of
the
bays
is
a
of
architecture
this
long
panegyric
by
on
french
taste
at
the
expense
of
norman
temper
ought
to
be
read
book
in
hand
before
the
cathedral
of
rouen
with
photographs
of
bayeux
to
compare
certain
it
is
that
the
normans
and
the
french
never
talked
quite
the
same
language
but
it
is
equally
certain
that
the
norman
language
to
the
english
ear
expressed
itself
quite
as
clearly
as
the
french
and
sometimes
seemed
to
have
more
to
express
the
complaint
of
the
french
artist
against
the
norman
is
the
mesquin
treatment
of
dividing
his
tower
into
storeys
of
equal
height
even
in
the
twelfth
century
and
in
religious
architecture
artists
already
struggled
over
the
best
solution
of
this
particularly
american
problem
of
the
twentieth
century
and
when
tourists
return
to
new
york
they
may
look
at
the
towers
which
decorate
the
city
to
see
whether
the
norman
or
the
french
plan
has
won
but
this
at
least
will
be
sure
in
advance
the
norman
will
be
the
practical
scheme
which
states
the
facts
and
stops
while
the
french
will
be
the
graceful
one
which
states
the
beauties
and
more
or
less
fits
the
facts
to
suit
them
both
styles
are
great
both
can
sometimes
be
tiresome
here
we
must
take
leave
of
normandy
a
small
place
but
one
which
like
attica
or
tuscany
has
said
a
great
deal
to
the
world
and
even
goes
on
saying
things
not
often
in
the
famous
genre
ennuyeux
to
this
day
for
gustave
flaubert
style
is
singularly
like
that
of
the
tour
and
the
going
up
the
seine
one
might
read
a
few
pages
of
his
letters
or
of
madame
de
bovary
to
see
how
an
old
art
transmutes
itself
into
a
new
one
without
changing
its
methods
some
critics
have
thought
that
at
times
flaubert
was
mesquin
like
the
norman
tower
but
these
are
as
the
french
say
the
defects
of
his
qualities
we
can
pass
over
them
and
let
our
eyes
rest
on
the
simplicity
of
the
norman
fleche
which
pierces
the
line
of
our
horizon
the
last
of
norman
art
is
seen
at
mantes
where
there
is
a
little
church
of
gassicourt
that
marks
the
farthest
reach
of
the
style
in
arms
as
in
architecture
mantes
barred
the
path
of
norman
conquest
william
the
conqueror
met
his
death
here
in
geographically
mantes
is
in
the
ile
de
france
less
than
forty
miles
from
paris
architecturally
it
is
paris
itself
while
forty
miles
to
the
southward
is
chartres
an
independent
or
only
feudally
dependent
country
no
matter
how
hurried
the
architectural
tourist
may
be
the
of
the
ile
de
france
is
not
to
be
crossed
without
stopping
if
he
came
down
from
the
north
or
east
he
would
have
equally
to
stop
either
at
beauvais
or
at
laon
or
noyon
or
soissons
because
there
is
an
architectural
douane
to
pass
and
one
architectural
baggage
must
be
opened
neither
notre
dame
de
paris
nor
notre
dame
de
chartres
is
quite
intelligible
unless
one
has
first
seen
notre
dame
de
mantes
and
studied
it
in
the
sacred
sources
of
notre
dame
de
mantes
is
a
sister
to
the
cathedral
of
paris
built
at
the
same
time
perhaps
by
the
same
architect
and
reproducing
its
general
dispositions
its
mode
of
structure
and
some
of
its
details
but
the
cathedral
of
paris
has
been
greatly
altered
so
that
its
original
arrangement
is
quite
changed
while
the
church
at
mantes
remains
practically
as
it
was
when
both
were
new
about
the
year
as
nearly
as
the
dates
can
be
guessed
the
cathedral
was
finished
up
to
its
vaulting
in
and
was
soon
afterwards
imitated
on
a
smaller
scale
at
mantes
the
scheme
seems
to
have
been
unsatisfactory
because
of
defects
in
the
lighting
for
the
whole
system
of
fenestration
had
been
changed
at
paris
before
naturally
at
great
cost
since
the
alterations
according
to
articles
cathedral
and
rose
and
allusions
triforium
left
little
except
the
unchanged
to
understand
the
paris
design
of
which
was
a
long
advance
from
the
older
plans
one
must
come
to
mantes
and
reflecting
that
the
great
triumph
of
chartres
was
its
fenestration
which
must
have
been
designed
immediately
after
one
can
understand
how
in
this
triangle
of
churches
only
forty
or
fifty
miles
apart
the
architects
watching
each
other
experiments
were
influenced
almost
from
day
to
day
by
the
failures
or
successes
which
they
saw
the
fenestration
which
the
paris
architect
planned
in
and
repeated
at
mantes
was
wholly
abandoned
and
a
new
system
introduced
immediately
after
the
success
of
chartres
in
as
they
now
stand
mantes
is
the
oldest
while
conscientiously
trying
to
keep
as
far
away
as
we
can
from
technique
about
which
we
know
nothing
and
should
care
if
possible
still
less
if
only
ignorance
would
help
us
to
feel
what
we
do
not
understand
still
the
conscience
is
happier
if
it
gains
a
little
conviction
founded
on
what
it
thinks
a
fact
even
theologians
even
the
great
theologians
of
the
thirteenth
century
even
saint
thomas
aquinas
himself
did
not
trust
to
faith
alone
or
assume
the
existence
of
god
and
what
saint
thomas
found
necessary
in
philosophy
may
also
be
a
sure
source
of
consolation
in
the
difficulties
of
art
the
church
at
mantes
is
a
very
early
fact
in
gothic
art
indeed
it
is
one
of
the
earliest
for
our
purposes
it
will
serve
as
the
very
earliest
of
pure
gothic
churches
after
the
transition
and
this
we
are
told
to
study
in
its
windows
before
one
can
get
near
enough
fairly
to
mark
the
details
of
the
facade
one
sees
the
great
rose
window
which
fills
a
space
nearly
feet
in
width
gothic
fanatics
commonly
reckon
the
great
rose
windows
of
the
thirteenth
century
as
the
most
beautiful
creation
of
their
art
among
the
details
of
ornament
and
this
particular
rose
is
the
direct
parent
of
that
at
chartres
which
is
classic
like
the
parthenon
while
both
of
them
served
as
models
or
guides
for
that
at
paris
which
dates
from
those
in
the
north
and
south
transepts
at
rheims
about
and
so
on
from
parent
to
child
till
the
rose
faded
forever
no
doubt
there
were
romanesque
roses
before
and
we
shall
see
them
but
this
rose
of
mantes
is
the
first
gothic
rose
of
great
dimensions
and
that
from
which
the
others
grew
in
its
simplicity
its
honesty
its
large
liberality
of
plan
it
is
also
one
of
the
best
if
is
a
true
guide
but
you
will
see
a
hundred
roses
first
or
last
and
can
choose
as
you
would
among
the
flowers
more
interesting
than
even
the
great
rose
of
the
portal
is
the
remark
that
the
same
is
carried
round
the
church
throughout
its
entire
system
of
fenestration
as
one
follows
it
on
the
outside
one
sees
that
all
the
windows
are
constructed
on
the
same
but
the
most
curious
arrangement
is
in
the
choir
inside
the
church
you
look
up
to
each
of
the
windows
through
a
sort
of
tunnel
or
telescope
an
arch
enlarging
outwards
the
roses
at
the
end
resembling
oculi
so
curious
is
this
arrangement
that
has
shown
it
under
the
head
triforium
in
drawings
and
sections
which
any
one
can
study
who
likes
its
interest
to
us
is
that
this
arrangement
in
the
choir
was
probably
the
experiment
which
proved
a
failure
in
notre
dame
at
paris
and
led
to
the
the
old
windows
and
substituting
those
which
still
stand
perhaps
the
rose
did
not
give
enough
light
although
the
church
at
mantes
seems
well
lighted
and
even
at
paris
the
rose
windows
remain
in
the
transepts
and
in
one
bay
of
the
nave
all
this
is
introduction
to
the
windows
of
chartres
but
these
three
churches
open
another
conundrum
as
one
learns
bit
by
bit
a
few
of
the
questions
to
be
asked
of
the
forgotten
middle
ages
the
church
towers
at
mantes
are
very
interesting
inside
and
out
they
are
evidently
studied
with
love
and
labour
by
their
designer
yet
they
have
no
fleches
how
happens
it
that
notre
dame
at
paris
also
has
no
fleches
although
the
towers
according
to
are
finished
in
full
preparation
for
them
this
double
omission
on
the
part
of
the
french
architect
seems
exceedingly
strange
because
his
rival
at
chartres
finished
his
fleche
just
when
the
architect
of
paris
and
mantes
was
finishing
his
towers
the
frenchman
was
certainly
consumed
by
jealousy
at
the
triumph
never
attained
on
anything
like
the
same
scale
by
any
architect
of
the
ile
de
france
and
he
was
actually
engaged
at
the
time
on
at
least
two
fleches
close
to
paris
one
at
another
of
which
proved
the
active
interest
he
took
in
the
difficulties
conquered
at
chartres
and
his
perfect
competence
to
deal
with
them
indeed
one
is
tempted
to
say
that
these
twin
churches
paris
and
mantes
are
the
only
french
churches
of
the
time
which
were
left
without
a
fleche
as
we
go
from
mantes
to
paris
we
pass
about
at
poissy
under
the
towers
of
a
very
ancient
and
interesting
church
which
has
the
additional
merit
of
having
witnessed
the
baptism
of
saint
louis
in
parts
of
the
church
at
poissy
go
back
to
the
seventh
and
ninth
centuries
the
square
base
of
the
tower
dates
back
before
the
time
of
hugh
capet
to
the
carolingian
age
and
belongs
like
the
square
tower
of
at
paris
to
the
old
defensive
military
architecture
but
it
has
a
later
stone
fleche
and
it
has
too
by
exception
a
central
octagonal
clocher
with
a
timber
fleche
which
dates
from
near
paris
itself
has
not
much
to
show
but
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
are
a
score
of
early
churches
with
charming
fleches
and
at
etampes
about
miles
to
the
south
is
an
extremely
interesting
church
with
an
exquisite
fleche
which
may
claim
an
afternoon
to
visit
that
at
is
a
still
easier
excursion
for
one
need
only
drive
over
from
chantilly
a
couple
of
miles
the
fascinating
old
abbey
church
of
looks
down
over
the
valley
of
the
oise
and
is
a
sort
of
antechamber
to
chartres
as
far
as
concerns
architecture
its
fleche
built
towards
when
that
at
chartres
was
rising
is
unlike
any
other
and
shows
how
much
the
french
architects
valued
their
lovely
french
creation
on
its
octagonal
faces
it
carries
upright
batons
or
lances
as
a
device
for
relieving
the
severity
of
the
outlines
a
device
both
intelligent
and
amusing
though
it
was
never
imitated
a
little
farther
from
paris
at
senlis
is
another
fleche
which
shows
still
more
plainly
the
effort
of
the
french
architects
to
vary
and
elaborate
the
chartres
scheme
as
for
laon
which
is
interesting
throughout
and
altogether
the
most
delightful
building
in
the
ile
de
france
the
fleches
are
gone
but
the
towers
are
there
and
you
will
have
to
study
them
before
studying
those
at
chartres
with
all
the
intelligence
you
have
to
spare
they
were
the
of
the
mediaeval
architect
in
his
own
opinion
all
this
makes
the
absence
of
fleches
at
paris
and
mantes
the
more
strange
want
of
money
was
certainly
not
the
cause
since
the
parisians
had
money
enough
to
pull
their
whole
cathedral
to
pieces
at
the
very
time
when
fleches
were
rising
in
half
the
towns
within
sight
of
them
possibly
they
were
too
ambitious
and
could
find
no
design
that
seemed
to
satisfy
their
ambition
they
took
pride
in
their
cathedral
and
they
tried
hard
to
make
their
shrine
of
our
lady
rival
the
great
shrine
at
chartres
of
course
one
must
study
their
beautiful
church
but
this
can
be
done
at
leisure
for
as
it
stands
it
is
later
than
chartres
and
more
conventional
leads
more
directly
to
chartres
but
perhaps
the
church
most
useful
to
know
is
no
longer
a
church
at
all
but
a
part
of
the
museum
of
arts
et
metiers
the
desecrated
champs
a
name
which
shows
that
it
dates
from
a
time
when
the
present
was
far
out
among
fields
the
choir
of
which
is
all
that
needs
noting
is
said
by
enlart
to
date
from
about
hidden
in
a
remnant
of
old
paris
near
the
pont
notre
dame
where
the
student
life
of
the
middle
ages
was
to
be
most
turbulent
and
the
latin
quarter
most
renowned
is
the
little
church
of
towards
on
the
whole
further
search
in
paris
would
not
greatly
help
us
if
one
is
to
pursue
the
early
centuries
one
must
go
farther
afield
for
the
schools
of
normandy
and
the
ile
de
france
were
only
two
among
half
a
dozen
which
flourished
in
the
various
provinces
that
were
to
be
united
in
the
kingdom
of
saint
louis
and
his
successors
we
have
not
even
looked
to
the
south
and
east
whence
the
impulse
came
the
old
carolingian
school
with
its
centre
at
is
quite
beyond
our
horizon
the
rhine
had
a
great
romanesque
architecture
of
its
own
one
broad
architectural
tide
swept
up
the
rhone
and
filled
the
burgundian
provinces
as
far
as
the
watershed
of
the
seine
another
lined
the
mediterranean
with
a
centre
at
arles
another
spread
up
the
western
rivers
the
charente
and
the
loire
reaching
to
le
mans
and
touching
chartres
two
more
lay
in
the
centre
of
france
spreading
from
perigord
and
clermont
in
auvergne
all
these
schools
had
individual
character
and
all
have
charm
but
we
have
set
out
to
go
from
to
chartres
in
three
centuries
the
eleventh
twelfth
and
thirteenth
trying
to
get
on
the
way
not
technical
knowledge
not
accurate
information
not
correct
views
either
on
history
art
or
religion
not
anything
that
can
possibly
be
useful
or
instructive
but
only
a
sense
of
what
those
centuries
had
to
say
and
a
sympathy
with
their
ways
of
saying
it
let
us
go
straight
to
chartres
chapter
v
towers
and
portals
for
a
first
visit
to
chartres
choose
some
pleasant
morning
when
the
lights
are
soft
for
one
wants
to
be
welcome
and
the
cathedral
has
moods
at
times
severe
at
best
the
beauce
is
a
country
none
too
gay
the
first
glimpse
that
is
caught
and
the
first
that
was
meant
to
be
caught
is
that
of
the
two
spires
with
all
the
education
that
normandy
and
the
ile
de
france
can
give
one
is
still
ignorant
the
spire
is
the
simplest
part
of
the
romanesque
or
gothic
architecture
and
needs
least
study
in
order
to
be
felt
it
is
a
bit
of
sentiment
almost
pure
of
practical
purpose
it
tells
the
whole
of
its
story
at
a
glance
and
its
story
is
the
best
that
architecture
had
to
tell
for
it
typified
the
aspirations
of
man
at
the
moment
when
aspirations
were
highest
yet
nine
persons
out
of
ten
perhaps
in
a
hundred
who
come
within
sight
of
the
two
spires
of
chartres
will
think
it
a
jest
if
they
are
told
that
the
smaller
of
the
two
the
simpler
the
one
that
impresses
them
least
is
the
one
which
they
are
expected
to
recognize
as
the
most
perfect
piece
of
architecture
in
the
world
perhaps
the
french
critics
might
deny
that
they
make
any
such
absolute
claim
in
that
case
you
can
ask
them
what
their
exact
claim
is
it
will
always
be
high
enough
to
astonish
the
tourist
astonished
or
not
we
have
got
to
take
this
southern
spire
of
the
chartres
cathedral
as
the
object
of
serious
study
and
before
taking
it
as
art
must
take
it
as
history
the
foundations
of
this
tower
always
to
be
known
as
the
old
tower
are
supposed
to
have
been
laid
in
before
the
first
crusade
the
fleche
was
probably
half
a
century
later
the
foundations
of
the
new
tower
opposite
were
laid
not
before
when
also
the
portal
which
stands
between
them
was
begun
with
the
three
lancet
windows
above
it
but
not
the
rose
for
convenience
this
old
facade
including
the
portal
and
the
two
towers
but
not
the
fleches
and
the
three
lancet
windows
but
not
the
rose
may
be
dated
as
complete
about
originally
the
whole
portal
the
three
doors
and
the
three
lancets
stood
nearly
forty
feet
back
on
the
line
of
the
interior
foundation
or
rear
wall
of
the
towers
this
arrangement
threw
the
towers
forward
free
on
three
sides
as
at
poitiers
and
gave
room
for
a
parvis
before
the
portal
a
porch
roofed
over
to
protect
the
pilgrims
who
always
stopped
there
to
pray
before
entering
the
church
when
the
church
was
rebuilt
after
the
great
fire
of
and
the
architect
was
required
to
enlarge
the
interior
the
old
portal
and
lancets
were
moved
bodily
forward
to
be
flush
with
the
front
walls
of
the
two
towers
as
you
see
the
facade
and
the
facade
itself
was
heightened
to
give
room
for
the
rose
and
to
cover
the
loftier
pignon
and
vaulting
behind
finally
the
wooden
roof
above
the
stone
vault
was
masked
by
the
arcade
of
kings
and
its
railing
completed
in
the
taste
of
philip
the
hardy
who
reigned
from
to
these
changes
have
of
course
altered
the
values
of
all
the
parts
the
portal
is
injured
by
being
thrown
into
a
glare
of
light
when
it
was
intended
to
stand
in
shadow
as
you
will
see
in
the
north
and
south
porches
over
the
transept
portals
the
towers
are
hurt
by
losing
relief
and
shadow
but
the
old
fleche
is
obliged
to
suffer
the
cruellest
wrong
of
all
by
having
its
right
shoulder
hunched
up
by
half
of
a
huge
rose
and
the
whole
of
a
row
of
kings
when
it
was
built
to
stand
free
and
to
soar
above
the
whole
facade
from
the
top
of
its
second
storey
one
can
easily
figure
it
so
and
replace
the
lost
parts
of
the
old
facade
more
or
less
at
haphazard
from
the
front
of
noyon
what
an
outrage
it
was
you
can
see
by
a
single
glance
at
the
new
fleche
opposite
the
architect
of
has
flatly
refused
to
submit
to
such
conditions
and
has
insisted
with
very
proper
on
starting
from
the
balustrade
of
the
arcade
of
kings
as
his
level
not
even
content
with
that
he
has
carried
up
his
square
tower
another
lofty
storey
before
he
would
consent
to
touch
the
heart
of
his
problem
the
conversion
of
the
square
tower
into
the
octagon
fleche
in
doing
this
he
has
sacrificed
once
more
the
old
fleche
but
his
own
tower
stands
free
as
it
should
at
vendome
when
you
go
there
you
will
be
in
a
way
to
appreciate
still
better
what
happened
to
the
chartres
fleche
for
the
clocher
at
vendome
which
is
of
the
same
date
says
earlier
and
enlart
after
stood
and
still
stands
free
like
an
italian
campanile
which
gives
it
a
vast
advantage
the
tower
of
also
after
stands
free
above
the
second
storey
indeed
you
will
hardly
find
in
the
long
list
of
famous
french
spires
another
which
has
been
treated
with
so
much
indignity
as
this
the
greatest
and
most
famous
of
all
and
perhaps
the
most
annoying
part
of
it
is
that
you
must
be
grateful
to
the
architect
of
for
doing
no
worse
he
has
on
the
contrary
done
his
best
to
show
respect
for
the
work
of
his
predecessor
and
has
done
so
well
that
handicapped
as
it
is
the
old
tower
still
defies
rivalry
nearly
three
hundred
and
fifty
feet
high
or
to
be
exact
metres
from
the
church
floor
it
is
built
up
with
an
amount
of
intelligence
and
refinement
that
leaves
to
unprofessional
visitors
no
chance
to
think
a
criticism
much
less
to
express
one
perhaps
when
we
have
seen
more
and
feel
less
who
knows
but
certainly
not
now
the
greatest
and
surely
the
most
beautiful
monument
of
this
kind
that
we
possess
in
france
says
but
although
an
ignorant
spectator
must
accept
the
architect
decision
on
a
point
of
relative
merit
no
one
is
compelled
to
accept
his
reasons
as
final
there
is
no
need
to
dwell
he
continues
upon
the
beauty
and
the
grandeur
of
composition
in
which
the
artist
has
given
proof
of
rare
sobriety
where
all
the
effects
are
obtained
not
by
ornaments
but
by
the
just
and
skilful
proportion
of
the
different
parts
the
transition
so
hard
to
adjust
between
the
square
base
and
the
octagon
of
the
fleche
is
managed
and
carried
out
with
an
address
which
has
not
been
surpassed
in
similar
monuments
one
stumbles
a
little
at
the
word
adresse
one
never
caught
one
self
using
the
word
in
norman
churches
your
photographs
of
bayeux
or
boscherville
or
secqueville
will
show
you
at
a
glance
whether
the
term
adresse
applies
to
them
even
vendome
would
rather
be
praised
for
droiture
than
for
adresse
whether
the
word
adresse
means
cleverness
dexterity
adroitness
or
simple
technical
skill
the
thing
itself
is
something
which
the
french
have
always
admired
more
than
the
normans
ever
did
himself
seems
to
be
a
little
uncertain
whether
to
lay
most
stress
on
the
one
or
the
other
quality
if
one
tries
to
appreciate
the
conception
of
this
tower
quotes
the
abbe
bulteau
one
will
see
that
it
is
as
frank
as
the
execution
is
simple
and
skilful
starting
from
the
bottom
one
reaches
the
summit
of
the
fleche
without
marked
break
without
anything
to
interrupt
the
general
form
of
the
building
this
clocher
whose
base
is
broad
pleine
massive
and
free
from
ornament
transforms
itself
as
it
springs
into
a
sharp
spire
with
eight
faces
without
its
being
possible
to
say
where
the
massive
construction
ends
and
the
light
construction
begins
granting
as
one
must
that
this
concealment
of
the
transition
is
a
beauty
one
would
still
like
to
be
quite
sure
that
the
chartres
scheme
is
the
best
the
norman
clochers
being
thrown
out
and
that
at
vendome
being
admittedly
simple
the
clocher
de
on
the
church
of
at
auxerre
seems
to
be
thought
among
the
next
in
importance
although
it
is
only
about
one
hundred
and
sixty
feet
in
height
metres
and
therefore
hardly
in
the
same
class
with
chartres
any
photograph
shows
that
the
auxerre
spire
is
also
simple
and
that
at
etampes
you
have
seen
already
to
be
of
the
vendome
rather
than
of
the
chartres
type
the
clocher
at
senlis
is
more
habile
it
shows
an
effort
to
be
clever
and
offers
a
standard
of
comparison
but
the
mediaeval
architects
seem
to
have
thought
that
none
of
them
bore
rivalry
with
laon
for
technical
skill
one
of
these
professional
experts
named
villard
de
honnecourt
who
lived
between
and
left
a
notebook
which
you
can
see
in
the
vitrines
of
the
bibliotheque
nationale
in
the
rue
richelieu
and
which
is
the
source
of
most
that
is
known
about
the
practical
ideas
of
mediaeval
architects
he
came
to
chartres
and
standing
here
before
the
doors
where
we
are
standing
he
made
a
rough
drawing
not
of
the
tower
but
of
the
rose
which
was
then
probably
new
since
it
must
have
been
planned
between
and
apparently
the
tower
did
not
impress
him
strongly
for
he
made
no
note
of
it
but
on
the
other
hand
when
he
went
to
laon
he
became
vehement
in
praise
of
the
cathedral
tower
there
which
must
have
been
then
quite
new
i
have
been
in
many
countries
as
you
can
find
in
this
book
in
no
place
have
i
ever
such
a
tower
seen
as
that
of
este
en
mult
de
tieres
si
cum
vus
pores
trover
en
cest
livre
en
aucun
liu
onques
tel
tor
ne
vi
com
est
cele
de
loon
the
reason
for
this
admiration
is
the
same
that
gives
for
admiring
the
tower
of
chartres
the
adresse
with
which
the
square
is
changed
into
the
octagon
not
only
is
the
tower
itself
changed
into
the
fleche
without
visible
junction
under
cover
of
four
corner
tourelles
of
open
work
on
slender
columns
which
start
as
squares
but
the
tourelles
also
convert
themselves
into
octagons
in
the
very
act
of
rising
and
end
in
octagon
fleches
that
carry
up
or
once
carried
up
the
lines
of
profile
to
the
central
fleche
that
soared
above
them
clearly
this
device
far
surpassed
in
cleverness
the
scheme
of
chartres
which
was
comparatively
heavy
and
structural
the
weights
being
adjusted
for
their
intended
work
while
the
transformation
at
laon
takes
place
in
the
air
and
challenges
discovery
in
defiance
of
one
keenest
eyesight
regard
how
the
tourelles
pass
from
one
disposition
to
another
in
rising
meditate
on
it
the
fleche
of
laon
is
gone
but
the
tower
and
tourelles
are
still
there
to
show
what
the
architects
of
the
thirteenth
century
thought
their
most
brilliant
achievement
one
can
not
compare
chartres
directly
with
any
of
its
contemporary
rivals
but
one
can
at
least
compare
the
old
spire
with
the
new
one
which
stands
opposite
and
rises
above
it
perhaps
you
will
like
the
new
best
built
at
a
time
which
is
commonly
agreed
to
have
had
the
highest
standard
of
taste
it
does
not
encourage
tourist
or
artist
to
insist
on
setting
up
standards
of
his
own
against
it
begun
in
it
was
finished
in
the
dome
of
saint
peter
at
rome
over
which
bramante
and
raphael
and
michael
angelo
toiled
was
building
at
the
same
time
leonardo
da
vinci
was
working
at
amboise
jean
bullant
pierre
lescot
and
their
patron
francis
i
were
beginning
their
architectural
careers
four
hundred
years
or
thereabouts
separated
the
old
spire
from
the
new
one
and
four
hundred
more
separate
the
new
one
from
us
if
who
himself
built
gothic
spires
had
cared
to
compare
his
fleches
at
with
the
new
fleche
at
chartres
he
might
perhaps
have
given
us
a
rule
where
adresse
ceases
to
have
charm
and
where
detail
becomes
tiresome
but
in
the
want
of
a
schoolmaster
to
lay
down
a
law
of
taste
you
can
admire
the
new
fleche
as
much
as
you
please
of
course
one
sees
that
the
lines
of
the
new
tower
are
not
clean
like
those
of
the
old
the
devices
that
cover
the
transition
from
the
square
to
the
octagon
are
rather
too
obvious
the
proportion
of
the
fleche
to
the
tower
quite
alters
the
values
of
the
parts
a
rigid
classical
taste
might
even
go
so
far
as
to
hint
that
the
new
tower
in
comparison
with
the
old
showed
signs
of
a
certain
tendency
toward
a
dim
and
distant
vulgarity
there
can
be
no
harm
in
admitting
that
the
new
tower
is
a
little
wanting
in
repose
for
a
tower
whose
business
is
to
counterpoise
the
very
classic
lines
of
the
old
one
but
no
law
compels
you
to
insist
on
absolute
repose
in
any
form
of
art
if
such
a
law
existed
it
would
have
to
deal
with
michael
angelo
before
it
dealt
with
us
the
new
tower
has
many
faults
but
it
has
great
beauties
as
you
can
prove
by
comparing
it
with
other
late
gothic
spires
including
those
of
its
chief
fault
is
to
be
where
it
is
as
a
companion
to
the
crusades
and
to
saint
bernard
it
lacks
austerity
as
a
companion
to
the
virgin
of
chartres
it
recalls
diane
de
poitiers
in
fact
the
new
tower
which
in
years
is
four
centuries
younger
than
its
neighbour
is
in
feeling
fully
four
hundred
years
older
it
is
if
not
vain
its
coiffure
is
elaborately
arranged
to
cover
the
effects
of
age
and
its
neck
and
shoulders
are
covered
with
lace
and
jewels
to
hide
a
certain
sharpness
of
skeleton
yet
it
may
be
beautiful
still
the
poets
derided
the
wrinkles
of
diane
de
poitiers
at
the
very
moment
when
king
henry
ii
idealized
her
with
the
homage
of
a
don
quixote
an
atmosphere
of
physical
beauty
and
decay
hangs
about
the
whole
renaissance
one
can
not
push
these
resemblances
too
far
even
for
the
twelfth
century
and
the
old
tower
exactly
what
date
the
old
tower
represents
as
a
social
symbol
is
a
question
that
might
be
as
much
disputed
as
the
beauty
of
diane
de
poitiers
and
yet
half
the
interest
of
architecture
consists
in
the
sincerity
of
its
reflection
of
the
society
that
builds
in
mere
time
by
actual
date
the
old
tower
represents
the
second
crusade
and
when
in
saint
bernard
was
elected
chief
of
that
crusade
in
this
very
cathedral
or
rather
in
the
cathedral
of
which
was
burned
the
workmen
were
probably
setting
in
mortar
the
stones
of
the
fleche
as
we
now
see
them
yet
the
fleche
does
not
represent
saint
bernard
in
feeling
for
saint
bernard
held
the
whole
array
of
in
horror
as
signs
merely
of
display
wealth
and
pride
the
fleche
rather
represents
abbot
suger
of
abbot
peter
the
venerable
of
cluny
abbot
abelard
of
and
queen
eleanor
of
guienne
who
had
married
in
who
had
taken
the
cross
from
saint
bernard
in
who
returned
from
the
holy
land
in
and
who
compelled
saint
bernard
to
approve
her
divorce
in
eleanor
and
saint
bernard
were
centuries
apart
yet
they
lived
at
the
same
time
and
in
the
same
church
speaking
exactly
the
old
tower
represents
neither
of
them
the
new
tower
itself
is
hardly
more
florid
than
eleanor
was
perhaps
less
so
if
one
can
judge
from
the
fashions
of
the
of
her
time
the
old
tower
is
almost
norman
while
eleanor
was
wholly
gascon
and
gascony
was
always
florid
without
being
always
correct
the
new
tower
if
it
had
been
built
in
like
the
old
one
would
have
expressed
eleanor
perfectly
even
in
height
and
apparent
effort
to
dwarf
its
mate
except
that
eleanor
dwarfed
her
husband
without
an
effort
and
both
in
art
and
in
history
the
result
lacked
harmony
be
the
contrast
what
it
may
it
does
not
affect
the
fact
that
no
other
church
in
france
has
two
spires
that
need
be
discussed
in
comparison
with
these
indeed
no
other
cathedral
of
the
same
class
has
any
spires
at
all
and
this
superiority
of
chartres
gave
most
of
its
point
to
a
saying
that
with
the
spires
of
chartres
the
choir
of
beauvais
the
nave
of
amiens
and
the
facade
of
rheims
one
could
make
a
perfect
church
for
us
tourists
the
towers
have
taken
much
time
though
they
are
the
least
religious
and
least
complicated
part
of
church
architecture
and
in
no
way
essential
to
the
church
indeed
saint
bernard
thought
them
an
excrescence
due
to
pride
and
worldliness
and
this
is
merely
saint
bernard
way
of
saying
that
they
were
an
ornament
created
to
gratify
the
artistic
sense
of
beauty
beautiful
as
they
are
eyes
must
drop
at
last
down
to
the
church
itself
if
the
spire
symbolizes
aspiration
the
door
symbolizes
the
way
and
the
portal
of
chartres
is
the
type
of
french
doors
it
stands
first
in
the
history
of
gothic
art
and
in
the
opinion
of
most
gothic
artists
first
in
the
interest
of
all
art
though
this
is
no
concern
of
ours
here
is
the
way
to
eternal
life
as
it
was
seen
by
the
church
and
the
art
of
the
first
crusade
the
fortune
of
this
monument
has
been
the
best
attested
miracle
de
la
vierge
in
the
long
list
of
the
virgin
miracles
for
it
comes
down
practically
unharmed
through
what
may
with
literal
accuracy
be
called
the
jaws
of
destruction
and
the
flames
of
hell
built
some
time
in
the
first
half
of
the
twelfth
century
it
passed
apparently
unscathed
through
the
great
fire
of
which
burnt
out
the
church
behind
and
even
the
timber
interior
of
the
towers
in
front
of
it
owing
to
the
enormous
mass
of
timber
employed
in
the
structure
of
the
great
churches
these
recurrent
fires
were
as
destructive
as
fire
can
be
made
yet
not
only
the
portals
with
their
statuary
and
carving
but
also
the
lancet
windows
with
their
glass
escaped
the
flames
and
what
is
almost
equally
strange
escaped
also
the
hand
of
the
builder
afterwards
who
if
he
had
resembled
other
architects
would
have
made
a
new
front
of
his
own
but
who
with
piety
unexampled
tenderly
took
the
old
stones
down
one
by
one
and
replaced
them
forty
feet
in
advance
of
their
old
position
the
english
wars
and
the
wars
of
religion
brought
new
dangers
sieges
and
miseries
the
revolution
of
brought
actual
rapine
and
waste
boys
have
flung
stones
at
the
saints
architects
have
wreaked
their
taste
within
and
without
fire
after
fire
has
calcined
the
church
vaults
the
worst
wrecker
of
all
the
restorer
of
the
nineteenth
century
has
prowled
about
it
yet
the
porch
still
stands
mutilated
but
not
restored
burned
but
not
consumed
as
eloquent
a
witness
to
the
power
and
perfections
of
our
lady
as
it
was
seven
hundred
years
ago
and
perhaps
more
impressive
you
will
see
portals
and
porches
more
or
less
of
the
same
period
elsewhere
in
many
different
places
at
paris
le
mans
sens
autun
vezelay
moissac
arles
a
score
of
them
for
the
same
piety
has
protected
them
more
than
once
but
you
will
see
no
other
so
complete
or
so
instructive
and
you
may
search
far
before
you
will
find
another
equally
good
in
workmanship
study
of
the
chartres
portal
covers
all
the
rest
the
feeling
and
motive
of
all
are
nearly
the
same
or
vary
only
to
suit
the
character
of
the
patron
saint
and
the
point
of
all
is
that
this
feeling
is
the
architectural
child
of
the
first
crusade
at
chartres
one
can
read
the
first
crusade
in
the
portal
as
at
in
the
aquilon
and
the
promenoir
the
abbe
bulteau
gives
reason
for
assuming
the
year
as
the
approximate
date
of
the
sculpture
about
the
west
portal
and
you
saw
at
in
the
promenoir
of
abbot
roger
ii
an
accurately
dated
work
of
the
same
decade
but
whatever
the
date
of
the
plan
the
actual
work
and
its
spirit
belong
to
or
thereabouts
some
fifty
years
had
passed
since
the
crusaders
streamed
through
constantinople
to
antioch
and
jerusalem
and
they
were
daily
going
and
returning
you
can
see
the
ideas
they
brought
back
with
the
relics
and
missals
and
enamels
they
bought
in
byzantium
over
the
central
door
is
the
christ
which
might
be
sculptured
after
a
byzantine
enamel
with
its
long
nimbus
or
aureole
or
glory
enclosing
the
whole
figure
over
the
left
door
is
an
ascension
bearing
the
same
stamp
and
over
the
right
door
the
seated
virgin
with
her
crown
and
her
two
attendant
archangels
is
an
empress
here
is
the
church
the
way
and
the
life
of
the
twelfth
century
that
we
have
undertaken
to
feel
if
not
to
understand
first
comes
the
central
doorway
and
above
it
is
the
glory
of
christ
as
the
church
at
chartres
understood
christ
in
the
year
for
the
glories
of
christ
were
many
and
the
chartres
christ
is
one
whatever
christ
may
have
been
in
other
churches
here
on
this
portal
he
offers
himself
to
his
flock
as
the
herald
of
salvation
alone
among
all
the
imagery
of
these
three
doorways
there
is
no
hint
of
fear
punishment
or
damnation
and
this
is
the
note
of
the
whole
time
before
the
church
seems
not
to
have
felt
the
need
of
appealing
habitually
to
terror
the
promise
of
hope
and
happiness
was
enough
even
the
portal
at
autun
which
displays
a
last
judgment
belonged
to
saint
lazarus
the
proof
and
symbol
of
resurrection
a
hundred
years
later
every
church
portal
showed
christ
not
as
saviour
but
as
judge
and
he
presided
over
a
last
judgment
at
bourges
and
amiens
and
here
on
the
south
portal
where
the
despair
of
the
damned
is
the
evident
joy
of
the
artist
if
it
is
not
even
sometimes
a
little
his
jest
which
is
worse
at
chartres
christ
is
identified
with
his
mother
the
spirit
of
love
and
grace
and
his
church
is
the
church
triumphant
not
only
is
fear
absent
there
is
not
even
a
suggestion
of
pain
there
is
not
a
martyr
with
the
symbol
of
his
martyrdom
and
what
is
still
more
striking
in
the
sculptured
life
of
christ
from
the
nativity
to
the
ascension
which
adorns
the
capitals
of
the
columns
the
single
scene
that
has
been
omitted
is
the
crucifixion
there
as
everywhere
in
this
portal
the
artists
seem
actually
to
have
gone
out
of
their
way
in
order
to
avoid
a
suggestion
of
suffering
they
have
pictured
christ
and
his
mother
in
all
the
other
events
of
their
lives
they
have
represented
evangelists
apostles
the
old
men
of
the
apocalypse
saints
prophets
kings
queens
and
princes
by
the
score
the
signs
of
the
zodiac
and
even
the
seven
liberal
arts
grammar
rhetoric
dialectics
arithmetic
geometry
astronomy
and
music
everything
is
there
except
misery
perhaps
our
lady
of
chartres
was
known
to
be
peculiarly
gracious
and
gentle
and
this
may
partially
account
also
for
the
extreme
popularity
of
her
shrine
but
whatever
the
reason
her
church
was
clearly
intended
to
show
only
this
side
of
her
nature
and
to
impress
it
on
her
son
you
can
see
it
in
the
grave
and
gracious
face
and
attitude
of
the
christ
raising
his
hand
to
bless
you
as
you
enter
his
kingdom
in
the
array
of
long
figures
which
line
the
entrance
to
greet
you
as
you
pass
in
the
expression
of
majesty
and
mercy
of
the
virgin
herself
on
her
throne
above
the
southern
doorway
never
once
are
you
regarded
as
a
possible
rebel
or
traitor
or
a
stranger
to
be
treated
with
suspicion
or
as
a
child
to
be
impressed
by
fear
equally
distinct
perhaps
even
more
emphatic
is
the
sculptor
earnestness
to
make
you
feel
without
direct
insistence
that
you
are
entering
the
court
of
the
queen
of
heaven
who
is
one
with
her
son
and
his
church
the
central
door
always
bore
the
name
of
the
royal
door
because
it
belonged
to
the
celestial
majesty
of
christ
and
naturally
bears
the
stamp
of
royalty
but
the
south
door
belongs
to
the
virgin
and
to
us
stop
a
moment
to
see
how
she
receives
us
remembering
or
trying
to
remember
that
to
the
priests
and
artists
who
designed
the
portal
and
to
the
generations
that
went
on
the
first
and
second
crusades
the
virgin
in
her
shrine
was
at
least
as
living
as
real
as
personal
an
empress
as
the
basilissa
at
constantinople
on
the
lintel
immediately
above
the
doorway
is
a
succession
of
small
groups
first
the
annunciation
mary
stands
to
receive
the
archangel
gabriel
who
comes
to
announce
to
her
that
she
is
chosen
to
be
the
mother
of
god
the
second
is
the
visitation
and
in
this
scene
also
mary
stands
but
she
already
wears
a
crown
at
least
the
abbe
bulteau
says
so
although
time
has
dealt
harshly
with
it
then
in
the
centre
follows
the
nativity
mary
lies
on
a
low
bed
beneath
or
before
a
sort
of
table
or
cradle
on
which
lies
the
infant
while
saint
joseph
stands
at
the
bed
head
then
the
angel
appears
directing
three
shepherds
to
the
spot
filling
the
rest
of
the
space
in
correct
theology
the
virgin
ought
not
to
be
represented
in
bed
for
she
could
not
suffer
like
ordinary
women
but
her
palace
at
chartres
is
not
much
troubled
by
theology
and
to
her
as
mother
the
pain
of
was
a
pleasure
which
she
wanted
her
people
to
share
the
virgin
of
chartres
was
the
greatest
of
all
queens
but
the
most
womanly
of
women
as
we
shall
see
and
her
double
character
is
sustained
throughout
her
palace
she
was
also
intellectually
gifted
in
the
highest
degree
in
the
upper
zone
you
see
her
again
at
the
presentation
in
the
temple
supporting
the
child
jesus
on
the
altar
while
simeon
aids
other
figures
bring
offerings
the
voussures
of
the
arch
above
contain
six
archangels
with
curious
wings
offering
worship
to
the
infant
and
his
imperial
mother
below
are
the
signs
of
the
zodiac
the
fishes
and
the
twins
the
rest
of
the
arch
is
filled
by
the
seven
liberal
arts
with
pythagoras
aristotle
cicero
euclid
nicomachus
ptolemy
and
priscian
as
their
representatives
testifying
to
the
intellectual
superiority
in
the
centre
sits
mary
with
her
crown
on
her
head
and
her
son
in
her
lap
enthroned
receiving
the
homage
of
heaven
and
earth
of
all
time
ancient
and
modern
of
all
thought
christian
and
pagan
of
all
men
and
all
women
including
if
you
please
your
homage
and
mine
which
she
receives
without
question
as
her
due
which
she
can
not
be
said
to
claim
because
she
is
above
making
claims
she
is
empress
her
left
hand
bore
a
sceptre
her
right
supported
the
child
who
looks
directly
forward
repeating
the
mother
attitude
and
raises
his
right
hand
to
bless
while
his
left
rests
on
the
orb
of
empire
she
and
her
child
are
one
all
this
was
noble
beyond
the
nobility
of
man
but
its
earthly
form
was
inspired
by
the
empire
rather
than
by
the
petty
royalty
of
or
his
pious
queen
alix
of
savoy
one
mark
of
the
period
is
the
long
oval
nimbus
another
is
the
imperial
character
of
the
virgin
a
third
is
her
unity
with
the
christ
which
is
the
church
to
us
the
mark
that
will
distinguish
the
virgin
of
chartres
or
if
you
prefer
the
virgin
of
the
crusades
is
her
crown
and
robes
and
throne
according
to
rohault
de
iconographie
de
la
sainte
vierge
the
virgin
headdress
and
ornaments
had
been
for
long
ages
borrowed
from
the
costume
of
the
empresses
of
the
east
in
honour
of
the
queen
of
heaven
no
doubt
the
virgin
of
chartres
was
the
virgin
recognized
by
the
empress
helena
mother
of
constantine
and
was
at
least
as
old
as
pilgrimage
to
jerusalem
in
she
was
not
a
western
feudal
queen
nor
was
her
son
a
feudal
king
she
typified
an
authority
which
the
people
wanted
and
the
fiefs
feared
the
pax
romana
the
omnipotence
of
god
in
government
in
all
europe
at
that
time
there
was
no
power
able
to
enforce
justice
or
to
maintain
order
and
no
symbol
of
such
a
power
except
christ
and
his
mother
and
the
imperial
crown
this
idea
is
very
different
from
that
which
was
the
object
of
our
pilgrimage
to
but
since
all
chartres
is
to
be
one
long
comment
upon
it
you
can
lay
the
history
of
the
matter
on
the
shelf
for
study
at
your
leisure
if
you
ever
care
to
study
into
the
weary
details
of
human
illusions
and
disappointments
while
here
we
pray
to
the
virgin
and
absorb
ourselves
in
the
art
which
is
your
pleasure
and
which
shall
not
teach
either
a
moral
or
a
useful
lesson
the
empress
mary
is
receiving
you
at
her
portal
and
whether
you
are
an
impertinent
child
or
a
foolish
old
or
an
insolent
prince
or
a
more
insolent
tourist
she
receives
you
with
the
same
dignity
in
fact
she
probably
sees
very
little
difference
between
you
an
empress
of
russia
would
probably
feel
little
difference
in
the
relative
rank
of
her
subjects
and
the
virgin
was
empress
over
emperors
patriarchs
and
popes
any
one
however
ignorant
can
feel
the
sustained
dignity
of
the
sculptor
work
which
is
asserted
with
all
the
emphasis
he
could
put
into
it
not
one
of
these
long
figures
which
line
the
three
doorways
but
is
an
officer
or
official
in
attendance
on
the
empress
or
her
son
and
bears
the
stamp
of
the
imperial
court
they
are
mutilated
but
if
they
have
been
treated
with
indignity
so
were
often
their
temporal
rivals
torn
to
pieces
trampled
on
to
say
nothing
of
being
merely
beheaded
or
poisoned
in
the
sacred
palace
and
the
hippodrome
without
losing
that
peculiar
oriental
dignity
of
style
which
seems
to
drape
the
least
dignified
attitudes
the
grand
air
of
the
twelfth
century
is
something
like
that
of
a
greek
temple
you
can
if
you
like
hammer
every
separate
stone
to
pieces
but
you
can
not
hammer
out
the
greek
style
there
were
originally
of
these
statues
and
nineteen
remain
beginning
at
the
north
end
and
passing
over
the
first
figure
which
carries
a
head
that
does
not
belong
to
it
notice
the
second
a
king
with
a
long
sceptre
of
empire
a
book
of
law
and
robes
of
byzantine
official
splendour
beneath
his
feet
is
a
curious
woman
head
with
heavy
braids
of
hair
and
a
crown
the
third
figure
is
a
queen
charming
as
a
woman
but
particularly
and
with
details
of
ornament
and
person
elaborately
wrought
worth
drawing
if
one
could
only
draw
worth
photographing
with
utmost
care
to
include
the
strange
support
on
which
she
stands
a
monkey
two
dragons
a
dog
a
basilisk
with
a
dog
head
two
prophets
follow
not
so
interesting
prophets
rarely
interest
then
comes
the
central
bay
two
queens
who
claim
particular
attention
then
a
prophet
then
a
saint
next
the
doorway
then
on
the
southern
another
saint
a
king
a
queen
and
another
king
last
comes
the
southern
bay
the
virgin
own
and
there
stands
first
a
figure
said
to
be
a
youthful
king
then
a
strongly
sculptured
saint
next
the
door
a
figure
called
also
a
king
but
so
charmingly
delicate
in
expression
that
the
robes
alone
betray
his
sex
and
who
this
exquisite
young
aureoled
king
may
have
been
who
stands
so
close
to
the
virgin
at
her
right
hand
no
one
can
now
reveal
opposite
him
is
a
saint
who
may
be
or
should
be
the
prince
of
the
apostles
then
a
bearded
king
with
a
broken
sceptre
standing
on
two
dragons
and
at
last
a
badly
mutilated
queen
these
statues
are
the
eginetan
marbles
of
french
art
from
them
all
modern
french
sculpture
dates
or
ought
to
date
they
are
singularly
interesting
as
naif
as
the
smile
on
the
faces
of
the
greek
warriors
but
no
more
grotesque
than
they
you
will
see
gothic
grotesques
in
plenty
and
you
can
not
mistake
the
two
intentions
the
twelfth
century
would
sooner
have
tempted
the
tortures
of
every
feudal
dungeon
in
europe
than
have
put
before
the
virgin
eyes
any
figure
that
could
be
conceived
as
displeasing
to
her
these
figures
are
full
of
feeling
and
saturated
with
worship
but
what
is
most
to
our
purpose
is
the
feminine
side
which
they
proclaim
and
insist
upon
not
only
the
number
of
the
female
figures
and
their
beauty
but
also
the
singularly
youthful
beauty
of
several
of
the
males
the
superb
robes
they
wear
the
expression
of
their
faces
and
their
figures
the
details
of
hair
stuffs
ornaments
jewels
the
refinement
and
feminine
taste
of
the
whole
are
enough
to
startle
our
interest
if
we
recognize
what
meaning
they
had
to
the
twelfth
century
these
figures
looked
stiff
and
long
and
thin
and
ridiculous
to
enlightened
citizens
of
the
eighteenth
century
but
they
were
made
to
fit
the
architecture
if
you
want
to
know
what
an
enthusiast
thinks
of
them
listen
to
huysmans
cathedral
beyond
a
doubt
the
most
beautiful
sculpture
in
the
world
is
in
this
place
he
can
hardly
find
words
to
express
his
admiration
for
the
queens
and
particularly
for
the
one
on
the
right
of
the
central
doorway
never
in
any
period
has
a
more
expressive
figure
been
thus
wrought
by
the
genius
of
man
it
is
the
of
infantile
grace
and
holy
candour
she
is
the
elder
sister
of
the
prodigal
son
the
one
of
whom
saint
luke
does
not
speak
but
who
if
she
existed
would
have
pleaded
the
cause
of
the
absent
and
insisted
with
the
father
that
he
should
kill
the
fatted
calf
at
his
son
return
the
idea
is
charming
if
you
are
the
returning
son
as
many
century
pilgrims
must
have
thought
themselves
but
in
truth
the
figure
is
that
of
a
queen
an
eleanor
of
guienne
her
position
there
is
due
to
her
majesty
which
bears
witness
to
the
celestial
majesty
of
the
court
in
which
she
is
only
a
and
she
is
hardly
more
humanly
fascinating
than
her
brother
the
youthful
king
at
the
virgin
right
hand
who
has
nothing
of
the
prodigal
son
but
who
certainly
has
much
of
lohengrin
or
even
almost
tristan
the
abbe
bulteau
has
done
his
best
to
name
these
statues
but
the
names
would
be
only
in
your
way
that
the
sculptor
meant
them
for
a
queen
of
sheba
or
a
king
of
israel
has
little
to
do
with
their
meaning
in
the
twelfth
century
when
the
people
were
much
more
likely
to
have
named
them
after
the
queens
and
kings
they
knew
the
whole
charm
lies
for
us
in
the
humanity
of
mary
and
her
court
not
in
the
scriptural
names
under
which
it
was
made
orthodox
here
in
this
western
portal
it
stands
as
the
crusaders
of
imagined
it
but
by
walking
round
the
church
to
the
porch
over
the
entrance
to
the
north
transept
you
shall
see
it
again
as
blanche
of
castile
and
saint
louis
imagined
it
a
hundred
years
later
so
that
you
will
know
better
whether
the
earthly
attributes
are
exaggerated
or
untrue
porches
like
steeples
were
rather
a
peculiarity
of
french
churches
and
were
studied
varied
one
might
even
say
petted
by
french
architects
to
an
extent
hardly
attempted
elsewhere
but
among
all
the
french
porches
those
of
chartres
are
the
most
famous
there
are
two
one
on
the
north
side
devoted
to
the
virgin
the
other
on
the
south
devoted
to
the
son
the
mass
of
intelligence
knowledge
acquaintance
with
effects
practical
experience
expended
on
these
two
porches
of
chartres
says
would
be
enough
to
establish
the
glory
of
a
whole
generation
of
artists
we
begin
with
the
north
porch
because
it
belonged
to
the
virgin
and
it
belonged
to
the
virgin
because
the
north
was
cold
bleak
sunless
windy
and
needed
warmth
peace
affection
and
power
to
protect
against
the
assaults
of
satan
and
his
swarming
devils
there
the
but
the
mother
received
other
mothers
who
suffered
like
her
but
who
as
a
rule
were
not
powerful
traditionally
in
the
primitive
church
the
northern
porch
belonged
to
the
women
when
they
needed
help
they
came
here
because
it
was
the
only
place
in
this
world
or
in
any
other
where
they
had
much
hope
of
finding
even
a
reception
see
how
mary
received
them
the
porch
extends
the
whole
width
of
the
transept
about
one
hundred
and
twenty
feet
metres
divided
into
three
bays
some
twenty
feet
deep
and
covered
with
a
stone
vaulted
roof
supported
on
piers
outside
begun
toward
under
philip
augustus
the
architectural
part
was
finished
toward
under
louis
viii
and
after
his
death
in
the
decorative
work
and
statuary
were
carried
on
under
the
regency
of
his
widow
blanche
of
castile
and
through
the
reign
of
her
son
saint
louis
until
about
when
the
work
was
completed
by
philip
the
hardy
a
gift
of
the
royal
family
of
france
all
the
members
of
the
family
seem
to
have
had
a
share
in
building
it
and
several
of
their
statues
have
been
supposed
to
adorn
it
the
walls
are
lined
the
porch
in
a
religious
sense
is
inhabited
by
more
than
seven
hundred
figures
great
and
small
all
in
one
way
or
another
devoted
to
the
glory
of
the
queen
of
heaven
you
will
see
that
a
hundred
years
have
converted
the
byzantine
empress
into
a
french
queen
as
the
same
years
had
converted
alix
of
savoy
into
blanche
of
castile
but
the
note
of
majesty
is
the
same
and
the
assertion
of
power
is
if
possible
more
emphatic
the
highest
note
is
struck
at
once
in
the
central
bay
over
the
door
where
you
see
the
coronation
of
mary
as
queen
of
heaven
a
favourite
subject
in
art
from
very
early
times
and
the
dominant
idea
of
mary
church
you
see
mary
on
the
left
seated
on
her
throne
on
the
right
seated
on
a
precisely
similar
throne
is
christ
who
holds
up
his
right
hand
apparently
to
bless
since
mary
already
bears
the
crown
mary
bends
forward
with
her
hands
raised
toward
her
son
as
though
in
gratitude
or
adoration
or
prayer
but
certainly
not
in
an
attitude
of
feudal
homage
on
either
side
an
archangel
swings
a
censer
on
the
lintel
below
on
the
left
is
represented
the
death
of
mary
on
the
right
christ
carries
in
the
folds
of
his
mantle
the
soul
of
mary
in
the
form
of
a
little
child
and
at
the
same
time
blesses
the
body
which
is
carried
away
by
angels
the
resurrection
of
mary
below
the
lintel
supporting
it
and
dividing
the
doorway
in
halves
is
the
trumeau
the
central
pier
a
new
part
of
the
portal
which
was
unknown
to
the
western
door
usually
in
the
virgin
churches
as
at
rheims
or
amiens
or
paris
the
virgin
herself
with
her
son
in
her
arms
stands
against
this
pier
trampling
on
the
dragon
with
the
woman
head
here
not
the
virgin
with
the
christ
but
her
mother
saint
anne
stands
with
the
infant
virgin
in
her
arms
while
beneath
is
or
was
saint
joachim
her
husband
among
his
flocks
receiving
from
the
archangel
gabriel
the
annunciation
so
at
the
entrance
the
virgin
declares
herself
divinely
queen
in
her
own
right
divinely
born
divinely
resurrected
from
death
on
the
third
day
seated
by
divine
right
on
the
throne
of
heaven
at
the
right
hand
of
god
the
son
with
whom
she
is
one
unless
we
feel
this
assertion
of
divine
right
in
the
queen
of
heaven
apart
from
the
trinity
yet
one
with
it
chartres
is
unintelligible
the
extreme
emphasis
laid
upon
it
at
the
church
door
shows
what
the
church
means
within
of
course
the
assertion
was
not
strictly
orthodox
perhaps
since
we
are
not
members
of
the
church
we
might
be
unnoticed
and
unrebuked
if
we
start
by
suspecting
that
the
worship
of
the
virgin
never
was
strictly
orthodox
but
chartres
was
hers
before
it
ever
belonged
to
the
church
and
like
lourdes
in
our
own
time
was
a
shrine
peculiarly
favoured
by
her
presence
the
mere
fact
that
it
was
a
bishopric
had
little
share
in
its
sanctity
the
bishop
was
much
more
afraid
of
mary
than
he
was
of
any
church
council
ever
held
critics
are
doing
their
best
to
destroy
the
peculiar
personal
interest
of
this
porch
but
tourists
and
pilgrims
may
be
excused
for
insisting
on
their
traditional
rights
here
since
the
porch
is
singular
even
in
the
thirteenth
century
for
belonging
entirely
to
them
and
the
royal
family
of
france
subject
only
to
the
virgin
true
artists
turned
critics
think
also
less
of
rules
than
of
values
and
no
ignorant
public
can
be
trusted
to
join
the
critics
in
losing
temper
judiciously
over
the
date
or
correctness
of
a
portrait
until
they
knew
something
of
its
motives
and
merits
the
public
has
always
felt
certain
that
some
of
the
statues
which
stand
against
the
outer
piers
of
this
porch
are
portraits
and
they
see
no
force
in
the
objection
that
such
decoration
was
not
customary
in
the
church
many
things
at
chartres
were
not
customary
in
the
church
although
the
church
now
prefers
not
to
dwell
on
them
therefore
the
student
returns
to
with
his
usual
delight
at
finding
at
least
one
critic
whose
sense
of
values
is
stronger
than
his
sense
of
rule
each
statue
he
says
in
his
dictionary
possesses
its
personal
character
which
remains
graven
on
the
memory
like
the
recollection
of
a
living
being
whom
one
has
known
a
large
part
of
the
statues
in
the
porches
of
notre
dame
de
chartres
as
well
as
of
the
portals
of
the
cathedrals
of
amiens
and
rheims
possess
these
individual
qualities
and
this
it
is
which
explains
why
these
statues
produce
on
the
crowd
so
vivid
an
impression
that
it
names
them
knows
them
and
attaches
to
each
of
them
an
idea
often
a
legend
probably
the
crowd
did
so
from
the
first
moment
they
saw
the
statues
and
with
good
reason
at
all
events
they
have
attached
to
two
of
the
most
individual
figures
on
the
north
porch
two
names
perhaps
the
best
known
in
france
in
the
year
but
which
since
the
year
can
have
conveyed
only
the
most
shadowy
meaning
to
any
but
pure
antiquarians
the
group
is
so
beautiful
as
to
be
given
a
plate
to
itself
in
the
monographie
number
as
representing
philip
hurepel
and
his
wife
mahaut
de
boulogne
so
little
could
any
crowd
or
even
any
antiquarian
at
any
time
within
six
hundred
years
have
been
likely
to
pitch
on
just
these
persons
to
associate
with
blanche
of
castile
in
any
kind
of
family
unity
that
the
mere
suggestion
seems
wild
yet
blanche
outlived
pierre
by
nearly
twenty
years
and
her
power
over
this
transept
and
porch
ended
only
with
her
death
as
regent
in
philippe
nicknamed
hurepel
boarskin
was
a
fils
defrance
whose
father
philip
augustus
had
serious
not
to
say
fatal
difficulties
with
the
church
about
the
legality
of
his
marriage
and
was
forced
to
abandon
his
wife
who
died
in
after
giving
birth
to
hurepel
in
the
child
was
recognized
as
legitimate
and
stood
next
to
the
throne
after
his
louis
who
was
thirteen
years
older
almost
at
his
birth
he
was
affianced
to
mahaut
countess
of
boulogne
and
the
marriage
was
celebrated
in
rich
and
strongly
connected
hurepel
naturally
thought
himself
and
was
head
of
the
royal
family
next
to
the
king
and
when
his
louis
viii
died
in
leaving
only
a
son
afterwards
saint
louis
a
boy
to
succeed
hurepel
very
properly
claimed
the
guardianship
of
his
infant
nephew
and
deeply
resented
being
excluded
by
queen
blanche
from
what
he
regarded
perhaps
with
justice
as
his
right
nearly
all
the
great
lords
and
the
members
of
the
royal
family
sided
with
him
and
entered
into
a
civil
war
against
blanche
at
the
moment
when
these
two
porches
of
chartres
were
building
between
and
the
two
greatest
leaders
of
the
conspiracy
were
hurepel
whom
we
are
expected
to
recognize
on
the
pier
of
this
porch
and
pierre
mauclerc
of
brittany
and
dreux
whom
we
have
no
choice
but
to
admit
on
the
trumeau
of
the
other
in
those
days
every
great
feudal
lord
was
more
or
less
related
by
blood
to
the
crown
and
although
blanche
of
castile
was
also
a
cousin
as
well
as
they
hated
her
as
a
spanish
intruder
with
such
hatred
as
men
felt
in
an
age
when
passions
were
real
that
these
two
men
should
be
found
here
associated
with
blanche
in
the
same
work
at
the
same
time
under
the
same
roof
is
a
fantastic
idea
and
students
can
feel
in
this
political
difficulty
a
much
stronger
objection
to
admitting
hurepel
to
queen
blanche
porch
than
any
supposed
rule
of
church
custom
yet
the
first
privilege
of
tourist
ignorance
is
the
right
to
see
or
try
to
see
their
thirteenth
century
with
eyes
passing
by
the
statues
of
philip
and
mahaut
and
stepping
inside
the
church
door
almost
the
first
figure
that
the
visitor
sees
on
lifting
his
eyes
to
the
upper
windows
of
the
transept
is
another
figure
of
philippe
hurepel
in
glass
on
his
knees
with
clasped
hands
before
an
altar
and
to
prevent
possibility
of
mistake
his
blazoned
coat
bears
the
words
phi
conte
de
bolone
apparently
he
is
the
donor
for
in
the
rose
above
he
sits
in
arms
on
a
white
horse
with
a
shield
bearing
the
blazon
of
france
obliged
to
make
his
peace
with
the
queen
in
hurepel
died
in
or
while
blanche
was
still
regent
and
instantly
took
his
place
as
of
right
side
by
side
with
blanche
castles
of
castile
among
the
great
benefactors
of
the
church
beneath
the
next
rose
is
mahaut
herself
as
donor
bearing
her
husband
arms
of
france
suggesting
that
the
windows
must
have
been
given
together
probably
before
philip
death
in
since
mahaut
was
married
again
in
this
time
to
alfonso
of
portugal
who
repudiated
her
in
and
left
her
to
die
in
her
own
town
of
boulogne
in
lastly
in
the
third
window
of
the
series
is
her
daughter
jeanne
iehenne
who
was
probably
born
before
and
who
was
married
in
to
gaucher
de
chatillon
one
of
the
greatest
warriors
of
his
time
jeanne
also
according
to
the
abbe
bulteau
bears
the
arms
of
her
father
and
mother
which
seems
to
suggest
that
she
gave
this
window
before
her
marriage
these
three
windows
therefore
have
the
air
of
dating
at
least
as
early
as
when
philip
hurepel
died
while
next
them
follow
two
more
roses
and
the
great
rose
of
france
presumably
of
the
same
date
all
scattered
over
with
the
castles
of
queen
blanche
the
motive
of
the
porch
outside
is
repeated
in
the
glass
as
it
should
be
and
as
the
saint
anne
of
the
rose
of
france
within
repeats
the
saint
anne
on
the
trumeau
of
the
portal
the
personal
stamp
of
the
royal
family
is
intense
but
the
stamp
of
the
virgin
personality
is
intenser
still
in
the
presence
of
mary
not
only
did
princes
hide
their
quarrels
but
they
also
put
on
their
most
courteous
manners
and
the
most
refined
and
even
austere
address
the
byzantine
display
of
luxury
and
adornment
had
vanished
all
the
figures
suggest
the
sanctity
of
the
king
and
his
sister
isabel
the
court
has
the
air
of
a
convent
but
the
idea
of
mary
majesty
is
asserted
through
it
all
the
artists
and
donors
and
priests
forgot
nothing
which
in
their
judgment
could
set
off
the
authority
elegance
and
refinement
of
the
queen
of
heaven
even
the
young
are
there
figured
by
the
twelve
virtues
and
the
fourteen
beatitudes
and
indeed
though
men
are
plenty
and
some
of
them
are
handsome
women
give
the
tone
the
charm
and
mostly
the
intelligence
the
court
of
mary
is
feminine
and
its
charms
are
grace
and
love
perhaps
even
more
grace
than
love
in
a
social
sense
if
you
look
at
beauty
and
friendship
among
beatitudes
huysmans
insists
that
this
sculpture
is
poor
in
comparison
with
his
prodigal
daughter
and
i
hope
you
can
enter
into
the
spirit
of
his
enthusiasm
but
other
people
prefer
the
work
and
think
it
equals
the
best
greek
approaching
or
surpassing
this
as
you
like
is
the
sculpture
you
will
see
at
rheims
of
the
same
period
and
perhaps
the
same
hands
but
for
our
purpose
the
queen
of
sheba
here
in
the
bay
is
enough
because
you
can
compare
it
on
the
spot
with
huysmans
figure
on
the
western
portal
which
may
also
be
a
queen
of
sheba
who
as
spouse
of
solomon
typified
the
church
and
therefore
prefigured
mary
herself
both
are
types
of
court
beauty
and
grace
one
from
the
twelfth
century
the
other
from
the
thirteenth
and
you
can
prefer
which
you
please
but
you
want
to
bear
in
mind
that
each
in
her
time
pleased
the
virgin
you
can
even
take
for
a
settled
fact
that
these
were
the
types
of
feminine
beauty
and
grace
which
pleased
the
virgin
beyond
all
others
the
purity
of
taste
feeling
and
manners
which
stamps
the
art
of
these
centuries
as
it
did
the
court
of
saint
louis
and
his
mother
is
something
you
will
not
wholly
appreciate
till
you
reach
the
depravity
of
the
valois
but
still
you
can
see
how
exquisite
the
virgin
taste
was
and
how
pure
you
can
also
see
how
she
shrank
from
the
sight
of
pain
here
in
the
central
bay
next
to
king
david
who
stands
at
her
right
hand
is
the
great
figure
of
abraham
about
to
sacrifice
isaac
if
there
is
one
subject
more
revolting
than
another
to
a
woman
who
typifies
the
mother
it
is
this
subject
of
abraham
and
isaac
with
its
compound
horror
of
masculine
stupidity
and
brutality
the
sculptor
has
tried
to
make
even
this
motive
a
pleasing
one
he
has
placed
abraham
against
the
column
in
the
correct
harshness
of
attitude
with
his
face
turned
aside
and
up
listening
for
his
orders
but
the
little
isaac
with
hands
and
feet
tied
leans
like
a
bundle
of
sticks
against
his
father
knee
with
an
expression
of
perfect
faith
and
confidence
while
left
hand
quiets
him
and
caresses
the
boy
face
with
a
movement
that
must
have
gone
straight
to
mary
heart
for
isaac
always
prefigured
christ
the
glory
of
mary
was
not
one
of
terror
and
her
porch
contains
no
appeal
to
any
emotion
but
those
of
her
perfect
grace
if
we
were
to
stay
here
for
weeks
we
should
find
only
this
idea
worked
into
every
detail
the
virgin
of
the
thirteenth
century
is
no
longer
an
empress
she
is
queen
mother
an
idealized
blanche
of
castile
too
high
to
want
or
suffer
or
to
revenge
or
to
aspire
but
not
too
high
to
pity
to
punish
or
to
pardon
the
women
went
to
her
porch
for
help
as
naturally
as
babies
to
their
mother
and
the
men
in
her
presence
fell
on
their
knees
because
they
feared
her
intelligence
and
her
anger
not
that
all
the
men
showed
equal
docility
we
must
go
next
round
the
church
to
the
south
porch
which
was
the
gift
of
pierre
mauclerc
comte
de
dreux
another
member
of
the
royal
family
grandson
of
louis
vi
and
therefore
second
cousin
to
louis
viii
and
philip
hurepel
philip
augustus
his
father
first
cousin
married
the
young
man
in
to
alix
heiress
of
the
duchy
of
brittany
and
this
marriage
made
him
one
of
the
most
powerful
vassals
of
the
crown
he
joined
philip
hurepel
in
resisting
the
regency
of
queen
blanche
in
and
blanche
after
a
long
struggle
caused
him
to
be
deposed
in
pierre
was
obliged
to
submit
and
was
pardoned
until
he
remained
in
control
of
the
duchy
of
brittany
but
then
was
obliged
to
surrender
his
power
to
his
son
and
turned
his
turbulent
activity
against
the
infidels
in
syria
and
egypt
dying
in
on
his
return
from
saint
louis
disastrous
crusade
pierre
de
dreux
was
a
masculine
character
a
bad
cleric
as
his
nickname
mauclerc
testified
but
a
gentleman
a
soldier
and
a
scholar
and
what
is
more
to
our
purpose
a
man
of
taste
he
built
the
south
porch
at
chartres
apparently
as
a
memorial
of
his
marriage
with
alix
in
and
the
statuary
is
of
the
same
date
with
that
of
the
north
porch
but
like
that
it
was
not
finished
when
pierre
died
in
one
would
like
to
know
whether
pierre
preferred
to
take
the
southern
entrance
or
whether
he
was
driven
there
by
the
royal
claim
to
the
virgin
favour
the
southern
porch
belongs
to
the
son
as
the
northern
belongs
to
the
mother
pierre
never
showed
much
deference
to
women
and
probably
felt
more
at
his
ease
under
the
protection
of
the
son
than
of
mary
but
in
any
case
he
showed
as
clearly
as
possible
what
he
thought
on
this
question
of
persons
to
pierre
christ
was
first
and
he
asserted
his
opinion
as
emphatically
as
blanche
asserted
hers
which
porch
is
the
more
beautiful
is
a
question
for
artists
to
discuss
and
decide
if
they
can
either
is
good
enough
for
us
whose
pose
is
ignorance
and
whose
pose
is
strictly
correct
but
apart
from
its
beauty
or
its
art
there
is
also
the
question
of
feeling
of
motive
which
puts
the
porche
de
dreux
in
contrast
with
the
porche
de
france
and
this
is
wholly
within
our
competence
at
the
outset
the
central
bay
displays
above
the
doorway
christ
on
a
throne
raising
his
hands
to
show
the
stigmata
the
wounds
which
were
the
proof
of
man
salvation
at
his
right
hand
sits
the
mother
without
her
crown
on
his
left
in
equal
rank
with
the
mother
sits
saint
john
the
evangelist
both
are
in
the
same
attitude
of
supplication
as
intercessors
there
is
no
distinction
in
rank
or
power
between
mary
and
john
since
neither
has
any
power
except
what
christ
gives
them
pierre
did
not
indeed
put
the
mother
on
her
knees
before
the
son
as
you
can
see
her
at
amiens
and
in
later
churches
certainly
bad
taste
in
mary
own
palace
but
he
allowed
her
no
distinction
which
is
not
her
strict
right
the
angels
above
and
around
bear
the
symbols
of
the
passion
they
are
unconscious
of
mary
presence
they
are
absorbed
in
the
perfections
of
the
son
on
the
lintel
just
below
is
the
last
judgment
where
saint
michael
reappears
weighing
the
souls
of
the
dead
which
mary
and
john
above
are
trying
to
save
from
the
strict
justice
of
christ
the
whole
melodrama
of
church
terrors
appears
after
the
manner
of
the
thirteenth
century
on
this
church
door
without
regard
to
mary
feelings
and
below
against
the
trumeau
stands
the
great
figure
of
christ
the
whole
church
trampling
on
the
lion
and
dragon
on
either
side
of
the
doorway
stand
six
great
figures
of
the
apostles
asserting
themselves
as
the
columns
of
the
church
and
looking
down
at
us
with
an
expression
no
longer
calculated
to
calm
our
fears
or
encourage
extravagant
hopes
no
figure
on
this
porch
suggests
a
portrait
or
recalls
a
memory
very
grand
indeed
is
this
doorway
dignified
impressive
and
masculine
to
a
degree
seldom
if
ever
equalled
in
art
and
the
left
bay
rivals
it
there
in
the
tympanum
christ
appears
again
standing
bearing
on
his
head
the
crown
royal
alone
except
for
the
two
angels
who
adore
and
surrounded
only
by
the
martyrs
his
witnesses
the
right
bay
is
devoted
to
saint
nicholas
and
the
saints
confessors
who
bear
witness
to
the
authority
of
christ
in
faith
of
the
great
figures
the
officers
of
the
royal
court
who
make
thus
the
strength
of
the
church
beneath
christ
not
one
is
a
woman
the
masculine
orthodoxy
of
pierre
mauclerc
has
spared
neither
sex
nor
youth
all
are
of
a
maturity
which
chills
the
blood
excepting
two
whose
youthful
beauty
is
heightened
by
the
severity
of
their
surroundings
so
that
the
abbe
bulteau
makes
bold
even
to
say
that
the
two
statues
of
saint
george
and
of
saint
theodore
may
be
regarded
as
the
most
beautiful
of
our
cathedral
perhaps
even
as
the
two
masterpieces
of
statuary
at
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
on
that
point
let
every
one
follow
his
taste
but
one
reflection
at
least
seems
to
force
itself
on
the
mind
in
comparing
these
figures
certainly
the
sword
however
it
may
compare
with
the
pen
in
other
directions
is
in
art
more
powerful
than
all
the
pens
or
volumes
or
crosiers
ever
made
your
golden
legend
and
roman
breviary
are
here
the
only
worth
consulting
and
the
stories
of
young
george
and
theodore
stand
there
recorded
as
their
miracle
under
the
walls
of
antioch
during
the
first
crusade
is
matter
of
history
but
among
these
magnificent
figures
one
detects
at
a
glance
that
it
is
not
the
religion
or
sacred
purity
of
the
subject
or
even
the
miracles
or
the
sufferings
which
inspire
passion
for
saint
george
and
saint
theodore
under
the
abbe
robe
it
is
with
him
as
with
the
plain
boy
and
girl
simply
youth
with
lance
and
sword
and
shield
these
two
figures
stand
in
the
outer
embrasures
of
the
left
bay
where
they
can
be
best
admired
and
perhaps
this
arrangement
shows
what
perron
de
dreux
as
he
was
commonly
called
loved
most
in
his
heart
of
hearts
but
elsewhere
even
in
this
porch
he
relaxed
his
severity
and
became
at
times
almost
gracious
to
women
good
judges
have
indeed
preferred
this
porch
to
the
northern
one
but
be
that
as
you
please
it
contains
seven
hundred
and
figures
large
and
small
to
serve
for
comparison
among
these
the
female
element
has
its
share
though
not
a
conspicuous
one
and
even
the
virgin
gets
her
rights
though
not
beside
her
son
to
see
her
you
must
stand
outside
in
the
square
and
with
a
glass
look
at
the
central
pignon
or
gable
of
the
porch
there
just
above
the
point
of
the
arch
you
will
see
mary
on
her
throne
crowned
wearing
her
royal
robes
and
holding
the
child
on
her
knees
with
the
two
archangels
on
either
side
offering
incense
pierre
de
dreux
or
some
one
else
admitted
at
last
that
she
was
queen
regent
although
evidently
not
eager
to
do
so
and
if
you
turn
your
glass
up
to
the
gable
of
the
transept
itself
above
the
great
rose
and
the
colonnade
over
it
you
can
see
another
and
a
colossal
statue
of
the
virgin
but
standing
with
the
child
on
her
left
arm
she
seems
to
be
crowned
and
to
hold
the
globe
in
her
right
hand
but
the
abbe
bulteau
says
it
is
a
flower
the
two
archangels
are
still
there
this
figure
is
thought
to
have
been
a
part
of
the
finishing
decoration
added
by
philip
the
fair
in
in
theology
pierre
de
dreux
seems
to
show
himself
a
more
learned
clerk
than
his
cousins
of
france
and
as
an
expression
of
the
meaning
the
church
of
mary
should
externally
display
the
porche
de
dreux
if
not
as
personal
is
as
energetic
as
the
porche
de
france
or
the
western
portal
as
we
pass
into
the
cathedral
under
the
great
christ
on
the
trumeau
you
must
stop
to
look
at
pierre
himself
a
bridegroom
crowned
with
flowers
on
his
he
kneels
in
prayer
while
two
servants
distribute
bread
to
the
poor
below
you
see
him
again
seated
with
his
wife
alix
before
a
table
with
one
loaf
assisting
at
the
meal
they
give
to
the
poor
pierre
kneels
to
god
he
and
his
wife
bow
before
the
virgin
and
the
poor
but
not
to
queen
blanche
now
let
us
enter
chapter
vi
the
virgin
of
chartres
we
must
take
ten
minutes
to
accustom
our
eyes
to
the
light
and
we
had
better
use
them
to
seek
the
reason
why
we
come
to
chartres
rather
than
to
rheims
or
amiens
or
bourges
for
the
cathedral
that
fills
our
ideal
the
truth
is
there
are
several
reasons
there
generally
are
for
doing
the
things
we
like
and
after
you
have
studied
chartres
to
the
ground
and
got
your
reasons
settled
you
will
never
find
an
antiquarian
to
agree
with
you
the
architects
will
probably
listen
to
you
with
contempt
and
even
these
excellent
priests
whose
kindness
is
great
whose
patience
is
heavenly
and
whose
good
opinion
you
would
so
gladly
gain
will
turn
from
you
with
pain
if
not
with
horror
the
gothic
is
singular
in
this
one
seems
easily
at
home
in
the
renaissance
one
is
not
too
strange
in
the
byzantine
as
for
the
roman
it
is
ourselves
and
we
could
walk
blindfolded
through
every
chink
and
cranny
of
the
greek
mind
all
these
styles
seem
modern
when
we
come
close
to
them
but
the
gothic
gets
away
no
two
men
think
alike
about
it
and
no
woman
agrees
with
either
man
the
church
itself
never
agreed
about
it
and
the
architects
agree
even
less
than
the
priests
to
most
minds
it
casts
too
many
shadows
it
wraps
itself
in
mystery
and
when
people
talk
of
mystery
they
commonly
mean
fear
to
others
the
gothic
seems
hoary
with
age
and
decrepitude
and
its
shadows
mean
death
what
is
curious
to
watch
is
the
fanatical
conviction
of
the
gothic
enthusiast
to
whom
the
twelfth
century
means
exuberant
youth
the
eternal
child
of
wordsworth
over
whom
its
immortality
broods
like
the
day
it
is
so
simple
and
yet
so
complicated
it
sees
so
much
and
so
little
it
loves
so
many
toys
and
cares
for
so
few
necessities
its
youth
is
so
young
its
age
so
old
and
its
youthful
yearning
for
old
thought
is
so
disconcerting
like
the
mysterious
senility
of
the
baby
that
deaf
and
silent
reads
the
eternal
deep
haunted
forever
by
the
eternal
mind
one
need
not
take
it
more
seriously
than
one
takes
the
baby
itself
our
amusement
is
to
play
with
it
and
to
catch
its
meaning
in
its
smile
and
whatever
chartres
maybe
now
when
young
it
was
a
smile
to
the
church
no
doubt
its
cathedral
here
has
a
fixed
and
administrative
meaning
which
is
the
same
as
that
of
every
other
bishop
seat
and
with
which
we
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
to
us
it
is
a
child
fancy
a
to
please
the
queen
of
heaven
to
please
her
so
much
that
she
would
be
happy
in
it
to
charm
her
till
she
smiled
the
queen
mother
was
as
majestic
as
you
like
she
was
absolute
she
could
be
stern
she
was
not
above
being
angry
but
she
was
still
a
woman
who
loved
grace
beauty
ornament
her
toilette
robes
jewels
who
considered
the
arrangements
of
her
palace
with
attention
and
liked
both
light
and
colour
who
kept
a
keen
eye
on
her
court
and
exacted
prompt
and
willing
obedience
from
king
and
archbishops
as
well
as
from
beggars
and
drunken
priests
she
protected
her
friends
and
punished
her
enemies
she
required
space
beyond
what
was
known
in
the
courts
of
kings
because
she
was
liable
at
all
times
to
have
ten
thousand
people
begging
her
for
favours
mostly
inconsistent
with
law
and
deaf
to
refusal
she
was
extremely
sensitive
to
neglect
to
disagreeable
impressions
to
want
of
intelligence
in
her
surroundings
she
was
the
greatest
artist
as
she
was
the
greatest
philosopher
and
musician
and
theologist
that
ever
lived
on
earth
except
her
son
who
at
chartres
is
still
an
infant
under
her
guardianship
her
taste
was
infallible
her
sentence
eternally
final
this
church
was
built
for
her
in
this
spirit
of
practical
utilitarian
faith
in
this
singleness
of
thought
exactly
as
a
little
girl
sets
up
a
for
her
favourite
blonde
doll
unless
you
can
go
back
to
your
dolls
you
are
out
of
place
here
if
you
can
go
back
to
them
and
get
rid
for
one
small
hour
of
the
weight
of
custom
you
shall
see
chartres
in
glory
the
palaces
of
earthly
queens
were
hovels
compared
with
these
palaces
of
the
queen
of
heaven
at
chartres
paris
laon
noyon
rheims
amiens
rouen
bayeux
coutances
a
list
that
might
be
stretched
into
a
volume
the
nearest
approach
we
have
made
to
a
palace
was
the
merveille
at
but
no
queen
had
a
palace
equal
to
that
the
merveille
was
built
or
designed
about
the
year
toward
the
year
louis
xi
built
a
great
castle
at
loches
in
touraine
and
there
queen
anne
de
bretagne
had
apartments
which
still
exist
and
which
we
will
visit
at
blois
you
shall
see
the
residence
which
served
for
catherine
de
medicis
till
her
death
in
anne
de
bretagne
was
trebly
queen
and
catherine
de
medicis
took
her
standard
of
comfort
from
the
luxury
of
florence
at
versailles
you
can
see
the
apartments
which
the
queens
of
the
bourbon
line
occupied
through
their
century
of
magnificence
all
put
together
and
then
trebled
in
importance
could
not
rival
the
splendour
of
any
single
cathedral
dedicated
to
queen
mary
in
the
thirteenth
century
and
of
them
all
chartres
was
built
to
be
peculiarly
and
exceptionally
her
delight
one
has
grown
so
used
to
this
sort
of
loose
comparison
this
reckless
waste
of
words
that
one
no
longer
adopts
an
idea
unless
it
is
driven
in
with
hammers
of
statistics
and
columns
of
figures
with
the
irritating
demand
for
literal
exactness
and
perfectly
straight
lines
which
lights
up
every
truly
american
eye
you
will
certainly
ask
when
this
exaltation
of
mary
began
and
unless
you
get
the
dates
you
will
doubt
the
facts
it
is
your
own
fault
if
they
are
tiresome
you
might
easily
read
them
all
in
the
iconographie
de
la
sainte
vierge
by
rohault
de
fleury
published
in
you
can
start
at
byzantium
with
the
empress
helena
in
or
with
the
council
of
ephesus
in
you
will
find
the
virgin
acting
as
the
patron
saint
of
constantinople
and
of
the
imperial
residence
under
as
many
names
as
artemis
or
aphrodite
had
borne
as
godmother

gave
to
murillo
the
subject
of
a
famous
painting
told
that
once
when
he
was
reciting
before
her
statue
the
ave
maris
stella
and
came
to
the
words
monstra
te
esse
matrem
the
image
pressing
its
breast
dropped
on
the
lips
of
her
servant
three
drops
of
the
milk
which
had
nourished
the
saviour
the
same
miracle
in
various
forms
was
told
of
many
other
persons
both
saints
and
sinners
but
it
made
so
much
impression
on
the
mind
of
the
age
that
in
the
fourteenth
century
dante
seeking
in
paradise
for
some
official
introduction
to
the
foot
of
the
throne
found
no
intercessor
with
the
queen
of
heaven
more
potent
than
saint
bernard
you
can
still
read
bernard
hymns
to
the
virgin
and
even
his
sermons
if
you
like
to
him
she
was
the
great
mediator
in
the
eyes
of
a
culpable
humanity
christ
was
too
sublime
too
terrible
too
just
but
not
even
the
weakest
human
frailty
could
fear
to
approach
his
mother
her
attribute
was
humility
her
love
and
pity
were
infinite
let
him
deny
your
mercy
who
can
say
that
he
has
ever
asked
it
in
vain
saint
bernard
was
emotional
and
to
a
certain
degree
mystical
like
adam
de
whose
hymns
were
equally
famous
but
the
emotional
saints
and
mystical
poets
were
not
by
any
means
allowed
to
establish
exclusive
rights
to
the
virgin
favour
abelard
was
as
devoted
as
they
were
and
wrote
hymns
as
well
philosophy
claimed
her
and
albert
the
great
the
head
of
scholasticism
the
teacher
of
thomas
aquinas
decided
in
her
favour
the
question
whether
the
blessed
virgin
possessed
perfectly
the
seven
liberal
arts
the
church
at
chartres
had
decided
it
a
hundred
years
before
by
putting
the
seven
liberal
arts
next
her
throne
with
aristotle
himself
to
witness
but
albertus
gave
the
reason
i
hold
that
she
did
for
it
is
written
has
built
herself
a
house
and
has
sculptured
seven
columns
that
house
is
the
blessed
virgin
the
seven
columns
are
the
seven
liberal
arts
mary
therefore
had
perfect
mastery
of
science
naturally
she
had
also
perfect
mastery
of
economics
and
most
of
her
great
churches
were
built
in
economic
centres
the
guilds
were
if
possible
more
devoted
to
her
than
the
monks
the
bourgeoisie
of
paris
rouen
amiens
laon
spend
money
by
millions
to
gain
her
favour
most
surprising
of
all
the
great
military
class
was
perhaps
the
most
vociferous
of
all
inappropriate
haunts
for
the
gentle
courteous
pitying
mary
a
field
of
battle
seems
to
be
the
worst
if
not
distinctly
blasphemous
yet
the
greatest
french
warriors
insisted
on
her
leading
them
into
battle
and
in
the
actual
melee
when
men
were
killing
each
other
on
every
in
europe
for
at
least
five
hundred
years
mary
was
present
leading
both
sides
the
of
the
famous
constable
du
guesclin
was
was
the
cry
of
the
great
sires
de
coucy
all
the
king
own
battle
at
one
time
cried
the
dukes
of
burgundy
cried
and
even
the
soldiers
of
the
pope
were
said
to
cry
the
measure
of
this
devotion
which
proves
to
any
religious
american
mind
beyond
possible
cavil
its
serious
and
practical
reality
is
the
money
it
cost
according
to
statistics
in
the
single
century
between
and
the
french
built
eighty
cathedrals
and
nearly
five
hundred
churches
of
the
cathedral
class
which
would
have
cost
according
to
an
estimate
made
in
more
than
five
thousand
millions
to
replace
five
thousand
million
francs
is
a
thousand
million
dollars
and
this
covered
only
the
great
churches
of
a
single
century
the
same
scale
of
expenditure
had
been
going
on
since
the
year
and
almost
every
parish
in
france
had
rebuilt
its
church
in
stone
to
this
day
france
is
strewn
with
the
ruins
of
this
architecture
and
yet
the
still
preserved
churches
of
the
eleventh
and
twelfth
centuries
among
the
churches
that
belong
to
the
romanesque
and
transition
period
are
numbered
by
hundreds
until
they
reach
well
into
the
thousands
the
share
of
this
capital
which
was
if
one
may
use
a
commercial
figure
invested
in
the
virgin
can
not
be
fixed
any
more
than
the
total
sum
given
to
religious
objects
between
and
but
in
a
spiritual
and
artistic
sense
it
was
almost
the
whole
and
expressed
an
intensity
of
conviction
never
again
reached
by
any
passion
whether
of
religion
of
loyalty
of
patriotism
or
of
wealth
perhaps
never
even
parallelled
by
any
single
economic
effort
except
in
war
nearly
every
great
church
of
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
belonged
to
mary
until
in
france
one
asks
for
the
church
of
notre
dame
as
though
it
meant
cathedral
but
not
satisfied
with
this
she
contracted
the
habit
of
requiring
in
all
churches
a
chapel
of
her
own
called
in
english
the
lady
chapel
which
was
apt
to
be
as
large
as
the
church
but
was
always
meant
to
be
handsomer
and
there
behind
the
high
altar
in
her
own
private
apartment
mary
sat
receiving
her
innumerable
suppliants
and
ready
at
any
moment
to
step
up
upon
the
high
altar
itself
to
support
the
tottering
authority
of
the
local
saint
expenditure
like
this
rests
invariably
on
an
economic
idea
just
as
the
french
of
the
nineteenth
century
invested
their
surplus
capital
in
a
railway
system
in
the
belief
that
they
would
make
money
by
it
in
this
life
in
the
thirteenth
they
trusted
their
money
to
the
queen
of
heaven
because
of
their
belief
in
her
power
to
repay
it
with
interest
in
the
life
to
come
the
investment
was
based
on
the
power
of
mary
as
queen
rather
than
on
any
orthodox
church
conception
of
the
virgin
legitimate
station
papal
rome
never
greatly
loved
byzantine
empresses
or
french
queens
the
virgin
of
chartres
was
never
wholly
sympathetic
to
the
roman
curia
to
this
day
the
church
writers
like
the
abbe
bulteau
or
rohault
de
fleury
are
singularly
shy
of
the
true
virgin
of
majesty
whether
at
chartres
or
at
byzantium
or
wherever
she
is
seen
the
fathers
martin
and
cahier
at
bourges
alone
left
her
true
value
had
the
church
controlled
her
the
virgin
would
perhaps
have
remained
prostrate
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
dragged
by
a
byzantine
court
backed
by
popular
insistence
and
impelled
by
overpowering
the
church
accepted
the
virgin
throned
and
crowned
seated
by
christ
the
judge
throned
and
crowned
but
even
this
did
not
wholly
satisfy
the
french
of
the
thirteenth
century
who
seemed
bent
on
absorbing
christ
in
his
mother
and
making
the
mother
the
church
and
christ
the
symbol
the
church
had
crowned
and
enthroned
her
almost
from
the
beginning
and
could
not
have
dethroned
her
if
it
would
in
all
christian
art
sculpture
or
mosaic
painting
or
poetry
the
virgin
rank
was
expressly
asserted
saint
bernard
like
john
comnenus
and
probably
at
the
same
time
chanted
hymns
to
the
virgin
as

to
have
held

higher
if
possible
than
that
of

his

certainly
quite
as
emphatic

of

a

completes
the
record
of

and
goes

one
might

say
at
once
officially
she
was
addressed
in
these
terms
of
supreme
majesty
imperatrix

coeli
regina
aula
regalis
but
the
twelfth
century
seemed
determined
to
carry
the
idea
out
to
its
logical
conclusion
in
defiance
of
dogma
not
only
was
the
son
absorbed
in
the
mother
or
represented
as
under
her
guardianship
but
the
father
fared
no
better
and
the
holy
ghost
followed
the
poets
regarded
the
virgin
as
the
templum
trinitatis
totius
trinitatis
nobile
triclinium
she
was
the
refectory
of
the
trinity
the
triclinium
because
the
refectory
was
the
largest
room
and
contained
the
whole
of
the
members
and
was
divided
in
three
parts
by
two
rows
of
columns
she
was
the
templum
trinitatis
the
church
itself
with
its
triple
aisle
the
trinity
was
absorbed
in
her
this
is
a
delicate
subject
in
the
church
and
you
must
feel
it
with
delicacy
without
brutally
insisting
on
its
necessary
contradictions
all
theology
and
all
philosophy
are
full
of
contradictions
quite
as
flagrant
and
far
less
sympathetic
this
particular
variety
of
religious
faith
is
simply
human
and
has
made
its
appearance
in
one
form
or
another
in
nearly
all
religions
but
though
the
twelfth
century
carried
it
to
an
extreme
and
at
chartres
you
see
it
in
its
most
charming
expression
we
have
got
always
to
make
allowances
for
what
was
going
on
beneath
the
surface
in
minds
consciously
or
unconsciously
and
for
the
latent
scepticism
which
lurks
behind
all
faith
the
church
itself
never
quite
accepted
the
full
claims
of
what
was
called
mariolatry
one
may
be
sure
too
that
the
bourgeois
capitalist
and
the
student
of
the
schools
each
from
his
own
point
of
view
watched
the
virgin
with
anxious
interest
the
bourgeois
had
put
an
enormous
share
of
his
capital
into
what
was
in
fact
an
economical
speculation
not
unlike
the
south
sea
scheme
or
the
railway
system
of
our
own
time
except
that
in
one
case
the
energy
was
devoted
to
shortening
the
road
to
heaven
in
the
other
to
shortening
the
road
to
paris
but
no
serious
schoolman
could
have
felt
entirely
convinced
that
god
would
enter
into
a
business
partnership
with
man
to
establish
a
sort
of
stock
society
for
altering
the
operation
of
divine
and
universal
laws
the
bourgeois
cared
little
for
the
philosophical
doubt
if
the
economical
result
proved
to
be
good
but
he
watched
this
result
with
his
usual
practical
sagacity
and
required
an
experience
of
only
about
three
generations
to
satisfy
himself
that
relics
were
not
certain
in
their
effects
that
the
saints
were
not
always
able
or
willing
to
help
that
mary
herself
could
not
certainly
be
bought
or
bribed
that
prayer
without
money
seemed
to
be
quite
as
efficacious
as
prayer
with
money
and
that
neither
the
road
to
heaven
nor
heaven
itself
had
been
made
surer
or
brought
nearer
by
an
investment
of
capital
which
amounted
to
the
best
part
of
the
wealth
of
france
economically
speaking
he
became
satisfied
that
his
enormous
had
proved
to
be
an
almost
total
loss
and
the
reaction
on
his
mind
was
as
violent
as
the
emotion
for
three
hundred
years
it
prostrated
france
the
efforts
of
the
bourgeoisie
and
the
peasantry
to
recover
their
property
so
far
as
it
was
recoverable
have
lasted
to
the
present
day
and
we
had
best
take
care
not
to
get
mixed
in
those
passions
if
you
are
to
get
the
full
enjoyment
of
chartres
you
must
for
the
time
believe
in
mary
as
bernard
and
adam
did
and
feel
her
presence
as
the
architects
did
in
every
stone
they
placed
and
every
touch
they
chiselled
you
must
try
first
to
rid
your
mind
of
the
traditional
idea
that
the
gothic
is
an
intentional
expression
of
religious
gloom
the
necessity
for
light
was
the
motive
of
the
gothic
architects
they
needed
light
and
always
more
light
until
they
sacrificed
safety
and
common
sense
in
trying
to
get
it
they
converted
their
walls
into
windows
raised
their
vaults
diminished
their
piers
until
their
churches
could
no
longer
stand
you
will
see
the
limits
at
beauvais
at
chartres
we
have
not
got
so
far
but
even
here
in
places
where
the
virgin
wanted
it
as
above
the
high
altar
the
architect
has
taken
all
the
light
there
was
to
take
for
the
same
reason
fenestration
became
the
most
important
part
of
the
gothic
architect
work
and
at
chartres
was
uncommonly
interesting
because
the
architect
was
obliged
to
design
a
new
system
which
should
at
the
same
time
satisfy
the
laws
of
construction
and
the
taste
and
imagination
of
mary
no
doubt
the
first
command
of
the
queen
of
heaven
was
for
light
but
the
second
at
least
equally
imperative
was
for
colour
any
earthly
queen
even
though
she
were
not
byzantine
in
taste
loved
colour
and
the
truest
of
queens
the
only
true
queen
of
queens
had
richer
and
finer
taste
in
colour
than
the
queens
of
fifty
earthly
kingdoms
as
you
will
see
when
we
come
to
the
immense
effort
to
gratify
her
in
the
glass
of
her
windows
illusion
for
illusion
granting
for
the
moment
that
mary
was
an
illusion
the
virgin
mother
in
this
instance
repaid
to
her
worshippers
a
larger
return
for
their
money
than
the
capitalist
has
ever
been
able
to
get
at
least
in
this
world
from
any
other
illusion
of
wealth
which
he
has
tried
to
make
a
source
of
pleasure
and
profit
the
next
point
on
which
mary
evidently
insisted
was
the
arrangement
for
her
private
apartments
the
apse
as
distinguished
from
her
the
choir
both
being
quite
distinct
from
the
hall
or
of
the
public
which
was
the
nave
with
its
enlargements
in
the
transepts
this
arrangement
marks
the
distinction
between
churches
built
as
shrines
for
the
deity
and
churches
built
as
halls
of
worship
for
the
public
the
difference
is
chiefly
in
the
apse
and
the
apse
of
chartres
is
the
most
interesting
of
all
apses
from
this
point
of
view
the
virgin
required
chiefly
these
three
things
or
if
you
like
these
four
space
light
convenience
and
colour
decoration
to
unite
and
harmonize
the
whole
this
concerns
the
interior
on
the
exterior
she
required
statuary
and
the
only
complete
system
of
decorative
sculpture
that
existed
seems
to
belong
to
her
churches
paris
rheims
amiens
and
chartres
mary
required
all
this
magnificence
at
chartres
for
herself
alone
not
for
the
public
as
far
as
one
can
see
into
the
spirit
of
the
builders
chartres
was
exclusively
intended
for
the
virgin
as
the
temple
of
abydos
was
intended
for
osiris
the
wants
of
man
beyond
a
mere
and
perhaps
space
to
some
degree
enter
to
no
very
great
extent
into
the
problem
of
chartres
man
came
to
render
homage
or
to
ask
favours
the
queen
received
him
in
her
palace
where
she
alone
was
at
home
and
alone
gave
commands
the
artist
second
thought
was
to
exclude
from
his
work
everything
that
could
displease
mary
and
since
mary
differed
from
living
queens
only
in
infinitely
greater
majesty
and
refinement
the
artist
could
admit
only
what
pleased
the
actual
taste
of
the
great
ladies
who
dictated
taste
at
the
courts
of
france
and
england
which
surrounded
the
little
court
of
the
counts
of
chartres
what
they
were
these
women
of
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
we
shall
have
to
see
or
seek
in
other
directions
but
chartres
is
perhaps
the
most
magnificent
and
permanent
monument
they
left
of
their
taste
and
we
can
begin
here
with
learning
certain
things
which
they
were
not
in
the
first
place
they
were
not
in
the
least
vague
dreamy
or
mystical
in
a
modern
sense
far
from
it
they
seemed
anxious
only
to
throw
the
mysteries
into
a
blaze
of
light
not
so
much
physical
perhaps
since
they
like
all
women
liked
moderate
shadow
for
their
toilettes
but
luminous
in
the
sense
of
faith
there
is
nothing
about
chartres
that
you
would
think
mystical
who
know
your
lohengrin
siegfried
and
parsifal
if
you
care
to
make
a
study
of
the
whole
literature
of
the
subject
read
male
art
religieux
du
xiiie
siecle
en
france
and
use
it
for
a
here
you
need
only
note
how
symbolic
and
how
simple
the
sculpture
is
on
the
portals
and
porches
even
what
seems
a
grotesque
or
an
abstract
idea
is
no
more
than
the
simplest
child
personification
on
the
walls
you
may
have
noticed
the
ane
qui
vielle
the
ass
playing
the
lyre
and
on
all
the
old
churches
you
can
see
bestiaries
as
they
were
called
of
fabulous
animals
symbolic
or
not
but
the
symbolism
is
as
simple
as
the
realism
of
the
oxen
at
laon
it
gave
play
to
the
artist
in
his
effort
for
variety
of
decoration
and
it
amused
the
people
probably
the
virgin
also
was
not
above
being
amused
now
and
then
it
seems
about
to
suggest
what
you
would
call
an
esoteric
meaning
that
is
to
say
a
meaning
which
each
one
of
us
can
consider
private
property
reserved
for
our
own
amusement
and
from
which
the
public
is
excluded
yet
in
truth
in
the
virgin
churches
the
public
is
never
excluded
but
invited
the
virgin
even
had
the
additional
charm
to
the
public
that
she
was
popularly
supposed
to
have
no
very
marked
fancy
for
priests
as
such
she
was
a
queen
a
woman
and
a
mother
functions
all
which
priests
could
not
perform
accordingly
she
seems
to
have
had
little
taste
for
mysteries
of
any
sort
and
even
the
symbols
that
seem
most
mysterious
were
clear
to
every
old
in
her
church
the
most
pleasing
and
promising
of
them
all
is
the
woman
figure
you
saw
on
the
front
of
the
cathedral
in
paris
her
eyes
bandaged
her
head
bent
down
her
crown
falling
without
cloak
or
royal
robe
holding
in
her
hand
a
guidon
or
banner
with
its
staff
broken
in
more
than
one
place
on
the
opposite
pier
stands
another
woman
with
royal
mantle
erect
and
commanding
the
symbol
is
so
graceful
that
one
is
quite
eager
to
know
its
meaning
but
every
child
in
the
middle
ages
would
have
instantly
told
you
that
the
woman
with
the
falling
crown
meant
only
the
jewish
synagogue
as
the
one
with
the
royal
robe
meant
the
church
of
christ
another
matter
for
which
the
female
taste
seemed
not
much
to
care
was
theology
in
the
metaphysical
sense
mary
troubled
herself
little
about
theology
except
when
she
retired
into
the
south
transept
with
pierre
de
dreux
even
there
one
finds
little
said
about
the
trinity
always
the
most
metaphysical
subtlety
of
the
church
indeed
you
might
find
much
amusement
here
in
searching
the
cathedral
for
any
distinct
expression
at
all
of
the
trinity
as
a
dogma
recognized
by
mary
one
can
not
take
seriously
the
idea
that
the
three
doors
the
three
portals
and
the
three
aisles
express
the
trinity
because
in
the
first
place
there
was
no
rule
about
it
churches
might
have
what
portals
and
aisles
they
pleased
both
paris
and
bourges
have
five
the
doors
themselves
are
not
allotted
to
the
three
members
of
the
trinity
nor
are
the
portals
while
another
more
serious
objection
is
that
the
side
doors
and
aisles
are
not
of
equal
importance
with
the
central
but
mere
adjuncts
and
dependencies
so
that
the
architect
who
had
misled
the
ignorant
public
into
accepting
so
black
a
heresy
would
have
deserved
the
stake
and
would
probably
have
gone
to
it
even
this
suggestion
of
trinity
is
wanting
in
the
transepts
which
have
only
one
aisle
and
in
the
choir
which
has
five
as
well
as
five
or
seven
chapels
and
as
far
as
an
ignorant
mind
can
penetrate
no
triplets
whatever
occasionally
no
doubt
you
will
discover
in
some
sculpture
or
window
a
symbol
of
the
trinity
but
this
discovery
itself
amounts
to
an
admission
of
its
absence
as
a
controlling
idea
for
the
ordinary
worshipper
must
have
been
at
least
as
blind
as
we
are
and
to
him
as
to
us
it
would
have
seemed
a
wholly
subordinate
detail
even
if
the
trinity
too
is
anywhere
expressed
you
will
hardly
find
here
an
attempt
to
explain
its
metaphysical
meaning
not
even
a
mystic
triangle
the
church
is
wholly
given
up
to
the
mother
and
the
son
the
father
seldom
appears
the
holy
ghost
still
more
rarely
at
least
this
is
the
impression
made
on
an
ordinary
visitor
who
has
no
motive
to
be
orthodox
and
it
must
have
been
the
same
with
the
worshipper
who
came
here
with
his
mind
absorbed
in
the
perfections
of
mary
chartres
represents
not
the
trinity
but
the
identity
of
the
mother
and
son
the
son
represents
the
trinity
which
is
thus
absorbed
in
the
mother
the
idea
is
not
orthodox
but
this
is
no
affair
of
ours
the
church
watches
over
its
own
the
virgin
wants
and
tastes
positive
and
negative
ought
now
to
be
clear
enough
to
enable
you
to
feel
the
artist
sincerity
in
trying
to
satisfy
them
but
first
you
have
still
to
convince
yourselves
of
the
people
sincerity
in
employing
the
artists
this
point
is
the
easiest
of
all
for
the
evidence
is
express
in
the
year
when
the
old
fleche
was
begun
the
year
before
saint
bernard
preached
the
second
crusade
at
vezelay
abbot
haimon
of
in
normandy
wrote
to
the
monks
of
tutbury
abbey
in
england
a
famous
letter
to
tell
of
the
great
work
which
the
virgin
was
doing
in
france
and
which
began
at
the
church
of
chartres
hujus
sacrae
institutionis
ritus
apud
carnotensem
ecclesiam
est
inchoatus
from
chartres
it
had
spread
through
normandy
where
it
produced
among
other
things
the
beautiful
spire
which
we
saw
at
postremo
per
totam
fere
normanniam
longe
lateque
convaluit
ac
loca
per
singula
matri
misericordiae
dicata
praecipue
occupavit
the
movement
affected
especially
the
places
devoted
to
mary
but
ran
through
all
normandy
far
and
wide
of
all
mary
miracles
the
best
attested
next
to
the
preservation
of
her
church
is
the
building
of
it
not
so
much
because
it
surprises
us
as
because
it
surprised
even
more
the
people
of
the
time
and
the
men
who
were
its
instruments
such
deep
popular
movements
are
always
surprising
and
at
chartres
the
miracle
seems
to
have
occurred
three
times
coinciding
more
or
less
with
the
dates
of
the
crusades
and
taking
the
organization
of
a
crusade
as
archbishop
hugo
of
rouen
described
it
in
a
letter
to
bishop
thierry
of
amiens
the
most
interesting
part
of
this
letter
is
the
evident
astonishment
of
the
writer
who
might
be
talking
to
us
so
modern
is
he
the
inhabitants
of
chartres
have
combined
to
aid
in
the
construction
of
their
church
by
transporting
the
materials
our
lord
has
rewarded
their
humble
zeal
by
miracles
which
have
roused
the
normans
to
imitate
the
piety
of
their
neighbours
since
then
the
faithful
of
our
diocese
and
of
other
neighbouring
regions
have
formed
associations
for
the
same
object
they
admit
no
one
into
their
company
unless
he
has
been
to
confession
has
renounced
enmities
and
revenges
and
has
reconciled
himself
with
his
enemies
that
done
they
elect
a
chief
under
whose
direction
they
conduct
their
waggons
in
silence
and
with
humility
the
quarries
at
are
about
five
miles
from
chartres
the
stone
is
excessively
hard
and
was
cut
in
blocks
of
considerable
size
as
you
can
see
for
yourselves
blocks
which
required
great
effort
to
transport
and
lay
in
place
the
work
was
done
with
feverish
rapidity
as
it
still
shows
but
it
is
the
solidest
building
of
the
age
and
without
a
sign
of
weakness
yet
the
abbot
told
with
more
surprise
than
pride
of
the
spirit
which
was
built
into
the
cathedral
with
the
stone
who
has
ever
seen
who
has
ever
heard
tell
in
times
past
that
powerful
princes
of
the
world
that
men
brought
up
in
honour
and
in
wealth
that
nobles
men
and
women
have
bent
their
proud
and
haughty
necks
to
the
harness
of
carts
and
that
like
beasts
of
burden
they
have
dragged
to
the
abode
of
christ
these
waggons
loaded
with
wines
grains
oil
stone
wood
and
all
that
is
necessary
for
the
wants
of
life
or
for
the
construction
of
the
church
but
while
they
draw
these
burdens
there
is
one
thing
admirable
to
observe
it
is
that
often
when
a
thousand
persons
and
more
are
attached
to
the
chariots
so
great
is
the
difficulty
yet
they
march
in
such
silence
that
not
a
murmur
is
heard
and
truly
if
one
did
not
see
the
thing
with
one
eyes
one
might
believe
that
among
such
a
multitude
there
was
hardly
a
person
present
when
they
halt
on
the
road
nothing
is
heard
but
the
confession
of
sins
and
pure
and
suppliant
prayer
to
god
to
obtain
pardon
at
the
voice
of
the
priests
who
exhort
their
hearts
to
peace
they
forget
all
hatred
discord
is
thrown
far
aside
debts
are
remitted
the
unity
of
hearts
is
established
but
if
any
one
is
so
far
advanced
in
evil
as
to
be
unwilling
to
pardon
an
offender
or
if
he
rejects
the
counsel
of
the
priest
who
has
piously
advised
him
his
offering
is
instantly
thrown
from
the
wagon
as
impure
and
he
himself
ignominiously
and
shamefully
excluded
from
the
society
of
the
holy
there
one
sees
the
priests
who
preside
over
each
chariot
exhort
every
one
to
penitence
to
confession
of
faults
to
the
resolution
of
better
life
there
one
sees
old
people
young
people
little
children
calling
on
the
lord
with
a
suppliant
voice
and
uttering
to
him
from
the
depth
of
the
heart
sobs
and
sighs
with
words
of
glory
and
praise
after
the
people
warned
by
the
sound
of
trumpets
and
the
sight
of
banners
have
resumed
their
road
the
march
is
made
with
such
ease
that
no
obstacle
can
retard
it
when
they
have
reached
the
church
they
arrange
the
wagons
about
it
like
a
spiritual
camp
and
during
the
whole
night
they
celebrate
the
watch
by
hymns
and
canticles
on
each
waggon
they
light
tapers
and
lamps
they
place
there
the
infirm
and
sick
and
bring
them
the
precious
relics
of
the
saints
for
their
relief
afterwards
the
priests
and
clerics
close
the
ceremony
by
processions
which
the
people
follow
with
devout
heart
imploring
the
clemency
of
the
lord
and
of
his
blessed
mother
for
the
recovery
of
the
sick
of
course
the
virgin
was
actually
and
constantly
present
during
all
this
labour
and
gave
her
assistance
to
it
but
you
would
get
no
light
on
the
architecture
from
listening
to
an
account
of
her
miracles
nor
do
they
heighten
the
effect
of
popular
faith
without
the
conviction
of
her
personal
presence
men
would
not
have
been
inspired
but
to
us
it
is
rather
the
inspiration
of
the
art
which
proves
the
virgin
presence
and
we
can
better
see
the
conviction
of
it
in
the
work
than
in
the
words
every
day
as
the
work
went
on
the
virgin
was
present
directing
the
architects
and
it
is
this
direction
that
we
are
going
to
study
if
you
have
now
got
a
realizing
sense
of
what
it
meant
without
this
sense
the
church
is
dead
most
persons
of
a
deeply
religious
nature
would
tell
you
emphatically
that
nine
churches
out
of
ten
actually
were
after
the
thirteenth
century
and
that
church
architecture
became
a
pure
matter
of
mechanism
and
mathematics
but
that
is
a
question
for
you
to
decide
when
you
come
to
it
and
the
pleasure
consists
not
in
seeing
the
death
but
in
feeling
the
life
now
let
us
look
about
chapter
vii
roses
and
apses
like
all
great
churches
that
are
not
mere
storehouses
of
theology
chartres
expressed
besides
whatever
else
it
meant
an
emotion
the
deepest
man
ever
felt
the
struggle
of
his
own
littleness
to
grasp
the
infinite
you
may
if
you
like
figure
in
it
a
mathematic
formula
of
infinity
the
broken
arch
our
finite
idea
of
space
the
spire
pointing
with
its
converging
lines
to
unity
beyond
space
the
sleepless
restless
thrust
of
the
vaults
telling
the
unsatisfied
incomplete
overstrained
effort
of
man
to
rival
the
energy
intelligence
and
purpose
of
god
thomas
aquinas
and
the
schoolmen
tried
to
put
it
in
words
but
their
church
is
another
chapter
in
act
all
man
work
ends
there
mathematics
physics
chemistry
dynamics
optics
every
sort
of
machinery
science
may
invent
to
this
favour
come
at
last
as
religion
and
philosophy
did
before
science
was
born
all
that
the
centuries
can
do
is
to
express
the
idea
differently
a
miracle
or
a
dynamo
a
dome
or
a
a
cathedral
or
a
world
fair
and
sometimes
to
confuse
the
two
expressions
together
the
world
fair
tends
more
and
more
vigorously
to
express
the
thought
of
infinite
energy
the
great
cathedrals
of
the
middle
ages
always
reflected
the
industries
and
interests
of
a
world
fair
chartres
showed
it
less
than
laon
or
paris
for
chartres
was
never
a
manufacturing
town
but
a
shrine
such
as
lourdes
where
the
virgin
was
known
to
have
done
miracles
and
had
been
seen
in
person
but
still
the
shrine
turned
itself
into
a
market
and
created
valuable
industries
indeed
this
was
the
chief
objection
which
saint
paul
made
to
ephesus
and
saint
bernard
to
the
cathedrals
they
were
in
some
ways
more
industrial
than
religious
the
mere
masonry
and
structure
made
a
vast
market
for
labour
the
fixed
metalwork
and
woodwork
were
another
but
the
decoration
was
by
far
the
greatest
the
the
glass
windows
the
sculpture
inside
and
out
were
done
mostly
in
workshops
on
the
spot
but
besides
these
fixed
objects
precious
works
of
the
highest
perfection

to
the

american
not
only
the
reason
for
the
church
tenacity
of
life
but
also
the
inducements
for
its
plunder
the
virgin
especially
required
all
the
resources
of
art
and
the
highest
notre
dame
of
chartres
would
have
laughed
at
notre

of
paris
if
she
had
detected
an
economy
in
her
robes
notre

of
rheims
or
rouen
would
have
derided
notre
dame
of
amiens
if
she
had
shown
a
feminine
domestic
maternal
turn
toward
cheapness
the
virgin
was
never
cheap
her
great
ceremonies
were
as
splendid
as
her
rank
of
queen
in
heaven
and
on
earth
required
and
as
her
procession
wound
its
way
along
the
aisles
through
the
crowd
of
her
subjects
up
to
the
high
altar
it
was
impossible
then
and
not
altogether
easy
now
to
resist
the
rapture
of
her
radiant
presence
many
a
young
person
and
now
and
then
one
who
is
not
in
first
youth
witnessing
the
sight
in
the
religious
atmosphere
of
such
a
church
as
this
without
a
suspicion
of
susceptibility
has
suddenly
seen
what
paul
saw
on
the
road
to
damascus
and
has
fallen
on
his
face
with
the
crowd
grovelling
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
which
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
feels
if
you
want
to
know
what
churches
were
made
for
come
down
here
on
some
great
festival
of
the
virgin
and
give
yourself
up
to
it
but
come
alone
that
kind
of
knowledge
can
not
be
taught
and
can
seldom
be
shared
we
are
not
now
seeking
religion
indeed
true
religion
generally
comes
unsought
we
are
trying
only
to
feel
gothic
art
for
us
the
world
is
not
a
schoolroom
or
a
pulpit
but
a
stage
and
the
stage
is
the
highest
yet
seen
on
earth
in
this
church
the
old
romanesque
leaps
into
the
gothic
under
our
eyes
of
a
sudden
between
the
portal
and
the
shrine
the
infinite
rises
into
a
new
expression
always
a
rare
and
excellent
miracle
in
thought
the
two
expressions
are
nowhere
far
apart
not
further
than
the
mother
from
the
son
the
new
artist
drops
unwillingly
the
hand
of
his
father
or
his
grandfather
he
looks
back
from
every
corner
of
his
own
work
to
see
whether
it
goes
with
the
old
he
will
not
part
with
the
western
portal
or
the
lancet
windows
he
holds
close
to
the
round
columns
of
the
choir
he
would
have
kept
the
round
arch
if
he
could
but
the
round
arch
was
unable
to
do
the
work
it
could
not
rise
so
he
broke
it
lifted
the
vaulting
threw
out
flying
buttresses
and
satisfied
the
virgin
wish
the
matter
of
gothic
vaulting
with
its
two
weak
points
the
flying
buttress
and
the
false
wooden
is
the
bete
noire
of
the
beaux
arts
the
duty
of
defence
does
not
lie
on
tourists
who
are
at
best
hardly
able
to
understand
what
it
matters
whether
a
wall
is
buttressed
without
or
within
and
whether
a
roof
is
single
or
double
no
one
objects
to
the
dome
of
saint
peter
no
one
finds
fault
with
the
pont
neuf
yet
it
is
true
that
the
gothic
architect
showed
contempt
for
facts
since
he
could
not
support
a
heavy
stone
vault
on
his
light
columns
he
built
the
lightest
possible
stone
vault
and
protected
it
with
a
wooden
which
constantly
burned
the
lightened
vaults
were
still
too
heavy
for
the
walls
and
columns
so
the
architect
threw
out
buttress
beyond
buttress
resting
on
separate
foundations
exposed
to
extreme
inequalities
of
weather
and
liable
to
multiplied
chances
of
accident
the
results
were
certainly
disastrous
the
roofs
burned
the
walls
yielded
flying
buttresses
were
not
a
necessity
the
merveille
had
none
the
angevin
school
rather
affected
to
do
without
them
albi
had
none
assisi
stands
up
independent
but
they
did
give
support
wherever
the
architect
wanted
it
and
nowhere
else
they
were
probably
cheap
and
they
were
graceful
whatever
expression
they
gave
to
a
church
at
least
it
was
not
that
of
a
fortress
amiens
and
albi
are
different
religions
the
expression
concerns
us
the
construction
concerns
the
beaux
arts
the
problem
of
permanent
equilibrium
which
distresses
the
builder
of
arches
is
a
technical
matter
which
does
not
worry
but
only
amuses
us
who
sit
in
the
audience
and
look
with
delight
at
the
theatrical
of
the
gothic
vault
the
astonishing
feat
of
building
up
a
skeleton
of
stone
ribs
and
vertebrae
on
which
every
pound
of
weight
is
adjusted
divided
and
carried
down
from
level
to
level
till
it
touches
ground
at
a
distance
as
a
bird
would
alight
if
any
stone
in
any
part
from
apex
to
foundation
weathers
or
gives
way
the
whole
must
yield
and
the
charge
for
repairs
is
probably
great
but
on
the
best
building
the
ecole
des
beaux
arts
can
build
the
charge
for
repairs
is
not
to
be
wholly
ignored
and
at
least
the
cathedral
of
chartres
in
spite
of
terribly
hard
usage
is
as
solid
as
when
it
was
built
and
as
plumb
without
crack
or
crevice
even
the
towering
fragment
at
beauvais
poorly
built
from
the
first
which
has
broken
down
oftener
than
most
gothic
structures
and
seems
ready
to
crumble
again
whenever
the
wind
blows
over
its
windy
plains
has
managed
to
survive
after
a
fashion
six
or
seven
hundred
years
which
is
all
that
our
generation
had
a
right
to
ask
the
vault
of
beauvais
is
nearly
one
hundred
and
sixty
feet
high
metres
and
was
cheaply
built
the
vault
of
saint
peter
at
rome
is
nearly
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
metres
that
of
amiens
is
one
hundred
and
feet
metres
rheims
bourges
and
chartres
are
nearly
the
same
height
at
the
entrance
one
hundred
and
feet
paris
is
one
hundred
and
ten
feet
the
abbe
bulteau
is
responsible
for
these
measurements
but
at
chartres
as
in
several
very
old
churches
the
nave
slopes
down
to
the
entrance
because
as
is
said
pilgrims
came
in
such
swarms
that
they
were
obliged
to
sleep
in
the
church
and
the
nave
had
to
be
sluiced
with
water
to
clean
it
the
true
height
of
chartres
at
the
croisee
of
nave
and
transept
is
as
near
as
possible
one
hundred
and
twenty
feet
metres
the
measured
height
is
the
least
interest
of
a
church
the
architect
business
is
to
make
a
small
building
look
large
and
his
failures
are
in
large
buildings
which
he
makes
to
look
small
one
chief
beauty
of
the
gothic
is
to
exaggerate
height
and
one
of
its
most
curious
qualities
is
its
success
in
imposing
an
illusion
of
size
without
leaving
the
heart
of
paris
any
one
can
study
this
illusion
in
the
two
great
churches
of
notre
dame
and
for
is
as
lofty
as
notre
dame
in
vaulting
and
larger
in
its
other
dimensions
besides
being
in
its
style
a
fine
building
yet
its
roman
arches
show
as
if
they
were
of
the
eleventh
century
why
the
long
clean
unbroken
refined
lines
of
the
gothic
curving
to
points
and
leading
the
eye
with
a
sort
of
compulsion
to
the
culminating
point
above
should
have
made
an
architectural
triumph
that
carried
all
europe
off
its
feet
with
delight
the
world
had
seen
nothing
to
approach
it
except
perhaps
in
the
dome
of
sancta
sophia
in
constantinople
and
the
discovery
came
at
a
moment
when
europe
was
making
its
most
united
and
desperate
struggle
to
attain
the
kingdom
of
heaven
according
to
chartres
was
the
final
triumph
of
the
experiment
on
a
very
great
scale
for
chartres
has
never
been
altered
and
never
needed
to
be
strengthened
the
flying
buttresses
of
chartres
answered
their
purpose
and
if
it
were
not
a
matter
of
pure
construction
it
would
be
worth
while
to
read
what
duc
says
about
them
article
the
vaulting
above
is
heavy
about
fifteen
inches
thick
the
buttressing
had
also
to
be
heavy
and
to
lighten
it
the
architect
devised
an
amusing
sort
of
arcades
applied
on
his
outside
buttresses
throughout
the
church
everything
was
solid
beyond
all
later
custom
so
that
architects
would
have
to
begin
by
a
study
of
the
crypt
which
came
down
from
the
eleventh
century
so
strongly
built
that
it
still
carries
the
church
without
a
crack
in
its
walls
but
if
we
went
down
into
it
we
should
understand
nothing
so
we
will
begin
as
we
did
outside
at
the
front
a
single
glance
shows
what
trouble
the
architect
had
with
the
old
facade
and
towers
and
what
temptation
to
pull
them
all
down
one
can
not
quite
say
that
he
has
spoiled
his
own
church
in
trying
to
save
what
he
could
of
the
old
but
if
he
did
not
quite
spoil
it
he
saved
it
only
by
the
exercise
of
an
amount
of
intelligence
that
we
shall
never
learn
enough
to
feel
our
incapacity
to
understand
true
ignorance
approaches
the
infinite
more
nearly
than
any
amount
of
knowledge
can
do
and
in
our
case
ignorance
is
fortified
by
a
certain
element
of
indifference
which
refuses
to
be
interested
in
what
it
can
not
understand
a
violent
reaction
from
the
thirteenth
century
which
cared
little
to
comprehend
anything
except
the
incomprehensible
the
architect
at
chartres
was
required
by
the
virgin
to
provide
more
space
for
her
worshippers
within
the
church
without
destroying
the
old
portal
and
fleche
which
she
loved
that
this
order
came
directly
from
the
virgin
may
be
taken
for
granted
at
chartres
one
sees
everywhere
the
virgin
and
nowhere
any
rival
authority
one
sees
her
give
orders
and
architects
obey
them
but
very
rarely
a
hesitation
as
though
the
architect
were
deciding
for
himself
in
his
western
front
the
architect
has
obeyed
orders
so
literally
that
he
has
not
even
taken
the
trouble
to
apologize
for
leaving
unfinished
the
details
which
if
he
had
been
responsible
for
them
would
have
been
his
anxious
care
he
has
gone
to
the
trouble
of
moving
the
heavy
doorways
forward
so
that
the
chapels
in
the
towers
which
were
meant
to
open
on
a
porch
now
open
into
the
nave
and
the
nave
itself
has
in
appearance
two
more
spans
than
in
the
old
church
but
the
work
shows
blind
obedience
as
though
he
were
doing
his
best
to
please
the
virgin
without
trying
to
please
himself
probably
he
could
in
no
case
have
done
much
to
help
the
side
aisles
in
their
abrupt
collision
with
the
solid
walls
of
the
two
towers
but
he
might
at
least
have
brought
the
vaulting
of
his
two
new
bays
in
the
nave
down
to
the
ground
and
finished
it
the
vaulting
is
awkward
in
these
two
bays
and
yet
he
has
taken
great
trouble
to
effect
what
seems
at
first
a
small
matter
whether
the
great
rose
window
was
an
afterthought
or
not
can
never
be
known
but
any
one
can
see
with
a
glass
and
better
on
the
architectural
plan
that
the
vaulting
of
the
main
church
was
not
high
enough
to
admit
the
great
rose
and
that
the
architect
has
had
to
slope
his
two
upward
so
great
is
the
height
that
you
can
not
see
this
difference
of
level
very
plainly
even
with
a
glass
but
on
the
plans
it
seems
to
amount
to
several
feet
perhaps
a
metre
the
architect
has
managed
to
deceive
our
eyes
in
order
to
enlarge
the
rose
but
you
can
see
as
plainly
as
though
he
were
here
to
tell
you
that
like
a
great
general
he
has
concentrated
his
whole
energy
on
the
rose
because
the
virgin
has
told
him
that
the
rose
symbolized
herself
and
that
the
light
and
splendour
of
her
appearance
in
the
west
were
to
redeem
all
his
awkwardnesses
of
course
this
idea
of
the
virgin
interference
sounds
to
you
a
mere
bit
of
fancy
and
that
is
an
account
which
may
be
settled
between
the
virgin
and
you
but
even
eyes
can
see
that
the
rose
redeems
everything
dominates
everything
and
gives
character
to
the
whole
church
in
view
of
the
difficulties
which
faced
the
artist
the
rose
is
inspired
genius
the
kind
of
genius
which
shakespeare
showed
when
he
took
some
other
man
play
and
adapted
it
thus
far
it
shows
its
power
chiefly
by
the
way
it
comes
forward
and
takes
possession
of
the
west
front
but
if
you
want
a
to
measure
by
you
may
mark
that
the
old
below
it
are
not
exactly
in
its
axis
at
the
outset
in
the
original
plan
of
or
thereabouts
the
old
tower
the
southern
tower
was
given
greater
width
than
the
northern
such
inequalities
were
common
in
the
early
churches
and
so
is
a
great
deal
of
dispute
in
modern
books
whether
they
were
accidental
or
intentional
while
no
one
denies
that
they
are
amusing
in
these
towers
the
difference
is
not
great
perhaps
fourteen
or
fifteen
inches
but
it
caused
the
architect
to
correct
it
in
order
to
fit
his
front
to
the
axis
of
the
church
by
throwing
his
entrance
six
or
seven
inches
to
the
south
and
narrowing
to
that
extent
the
south
door
and
south
lancet
the
effect
was
bad
even
then
and
went
far
to
ruin
the
south
window
but
when
after
the
fire
of
the
architect
inserted
his
great
rose
filling
every
inch
of
possible
space
between
the
lancet
and
the
arch
of
the
vault
he
made
another
correction
which
threw
his
rose
six
or
seven
inches
out
of
axis
with
the
lancets
not
one
person
in
a
hundred
thousand
would
notice
it
here
in
the
interior
so
completely
are
we
under
the
control
of
the
artist
and
the
virgin
but
it
is
a
measure
of
the
power
of
the
rose
looking
farther
one
sees
that
the
which
so
dominates
the
west
front
is
carried
round
the
church
and
comes
to
another
outburst
of
splendour
in
the
transepts
this
leads
back
to
fenestration
on
a
great
scale
which
is
a
terribly
ambitious
flight
for
tourists
all
the
more
because
here
the
tourist
gets
little
help
from
the
architect
who
in
modern
times
has
seldom
the
opportunity
to
study
the
subject
at
all
and
accepts
as
solved
the
problems
of
early
gothic
fenestration
one
becomes
pedantic
and
pretentious
at
the
very
sound
of
the
word
which
is
an
intolerable
piece
of
pedantry
in
itself
but
chartres
is
all
windows
and
its
windows
were
as
triumphant
as
its
virgin
and
were
one
of
her
miracles
one
can
no
more
overlook
the
windows
of
chartres
than
the
glass
which
is
in
them
we
have
already
looked
at
the
windows
of
mantes
we
have
seen
what
happened
to
the
windows
at
paris
paris
had
at
one
leap
risen
feet
higher
than
noyon
and
even
at
noyon
the
architect
about
had
been
obliged
to
invent
new
fenestration
paris
and
mantes
twenty
years
later
made
another
effort
which
proved
a
failure
then
the
architect
of
chartres
in
added
ten
feet
more
to
his
vault
and
undertook
once
for
all
to
show
how
a
great
cathedral
should
be
lighted
as
an
architectural
problem
it
passes
far
beyond
our
powers
of
understanding
even
when
solved
but
we
can
always
turn
to
see
what
the
inevitable
says
about
its
solution
at
chartres
toward
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
the
architect
of
the
cathedral
of
chartres
sought
out
entirely
new
window
combinations
to
light
the
nave
from
above
below
in
the
side
aisles
he
kept
to
the
customs
of
the
times
that
is
he
opened
pointed
windows
which
did
not
wholly
fill
the
spaces
between
the
piers
he
wanted
or
was
willing
to
leave
here
below
the
effect
of
a
wall
but
in
the
upper
part
of
his
building
we
see
that
he
changed
the
system
he
throws
a
round
arch
directly
across
from
one
pier
to
the
next
then
in
the
enormous
space
which
remains
within
each
span
he
inserts
two
large
pointed
windows
surmounted
by
a
great
rose
we
recognize
in
this
construction
of
notre
dame
de
chartres
a
boldness
a
force
which
contrast
with
the
fumbling
of
the
architects
in
the
ile
de
france
and
champagne
for
the
first
time
one
sees
at
chartres
the
builder
deal
frankly
with
the
clerestory
or
upper
fenestration
occupying
the
whole
width
of
the
arches
and
taking
the
arch
of
the
vault
as
the
arch
of
the
window
simplicity
of
construction
beauty
in
form
strong
workmanship
structure
true
and
solid
judicious
choice
of
material
all
the
characteristics
of
good
work
unite
in
this
magnificent
specimen
of
architecture
at
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
does
not
call
attention
to
a
score
of
other
matters
which
the
architect
must
have
had
in
his
mind
such
as
the
distribution
of
light
and
the
relations
of
one
arrangement
with
another
the
nave
with
the
aisles
and
both
with
the
transepts
and
all
with
the
choir
following
him
we
must
take
the
choir
separately
and
the
aisles
and
chapels
of
the
apse
also
one
can
not
hope
to
understand
all
the
experiments
and
refinements
of
the
artist
either
in
their
successes
or
their
failures
but
with
diffidence
one
may
ask
one
self
whether
the
beauty
of
the
arrangement
as
compared
with
the
original
arrangement
in
paris
did
not
consist
in
retaining
the
throughout
while
throwing
the
whole
upper
wall
into
window
triumphant
as
the
clerestory
windows
are
they
owe
their
charm
largely
to
their
roses
as
you
see
by
looking
at
the
same
scheme
applied
on
a
larger
scale
on
the
transept
fronts
and
then
by
taking
stand
under
the
croisee
and
looking
at
all
in
succession
as
a
whole
the
rose
window
was
not
gothic
but
romanesque
and
needed
a
great
deal
of
coaxing
to
feel
at
home
within
the
pointed
arch
at
first
the
architects
felt
the
awkwardness
so
strongly
that
they
avoided
it
wherever
they
could
in
the
beautiful
facade
of
laon
one
of
the
chief
beauties
is
the
setting
of
the
rose
under
a
deep
round
arch
the
western
roses
of
mantes
and
paris
are
treated
in
the
same
way
although
a
captious
critic
might
complain
that
their
treatment
is
not
so
effective
or
so
logical
rheims
boldly
imprisoned
the
roses
within
the
pointed
arch
but
amiens
toward
took
refuge
in
the
same
square
exterior
setting
that
was
preferred
in
here
at
chartres
and
in
the
interior
of
amiens
the
round
arch
of
the
rose
is
the
last
vault
of
the
nave
seen
through
a
vista
of
pointed
vaults
as
it
is
here
all
these
are
supposed
to
be
among
the
chief
beauties
of
the
gothic
facade
although
the
gothic
architect
if
he
had
been
a
man
of
logic
would
have
clung
to
his
lines
and
put
a
pointed
window
in
his
front
as
in
fact
he
did
at
coutances
he
felt
the
value
of
the
rose
in
art
and
perhaps
still
more
in
religion
for
the
rose
was
mary
emblem
one
is
fairly
sure
that
the
great
chartres
rose
of
the
west
front
was
put
there
to
please
her
since
it
was
to
be
always
before
her
eyes
the
most
conspicuous
object
she
would
see
from
the
high
altar
and
therefore
the
most
carefully
considered
ornament
in
the
whole
church
outside
the
choir
the
mere
size
proves
the
importance
she
gave
it
the
exterior
diameter
is
nearly
feet
metres
the
nave
of
chartres
is
next
perhaps
to
the
nave
of
angers
the
widest
of
all
gothic
naves
about
feet
metres
and
the
rose
takes
every
inch
it
can
get
of
this
enormous
span
the
value
of
the
rose
among
architects
of
the
time
was
great
since
it
was
the
only
part
of
the
church
that
villard
de
honnecourt
sketched
and
since
his
time
it
has
been
drawn
and
redrawn
described
and
commented
by
generations
of
architects
till
it
has
become
as
classic
as
the
parthenon
yet
this
chartres
rose
is
solid
serious
sedate
to
a
degree
unusual
in
its
own
age
it
is
even
more
romanesque
than
the
pure
romanesque
roses
at
beauvais
you
must
stop
a
moment
to
look
at
a
romanesque
rose
on
the
transept
of
the
church
of
mentions
it
with
a
drawing
article
pignon
as
not
earlier
than
the
year
therefore
about
a
century
earlier
than
the
rose
of
chartres
it
is
not
properly
a
rose
but
a
wheel
of
fortune
with
figures
climbing
up
and
falling
over
another
supposed
rose
is
at
etampes
which
goes
with
that
of
laon
and
and
mantes
the
rose
of
chartres
is
so
much
the
most
serious
of
them
all
that
has
explained
it
by
its
material
the
heavy
stone
of
bercheres
but
the
material
was
not
allowed
to
affect
the
great
transept
roses
and
the
architect
made
his
material
yield
to
his
object
wherever
he
thought
it
worth
while
standing
under
the
central
croisee
you
can
see
all
three
roses
by
simply
turning
your
head
that
on
the
north
the
rose
de
france
was
built
or
planned
between
and
in
the
reign
of
philip
augustus
since
the
porch
outside
which
would
be
a
later
construction
was
begun
by
the
rose
de
france
is
the
same
in
diameter
as
the
western
rose
but
lighter
and
built
of
lighter
stone
opposite
the
rose
de
france
stands
on
the
south
front
pierre
mauclerc
rose
de
dreux
of
the
same
date
with
the
same
motive
but
even
lighter
more
like
a
rose
and
less
like
a
wheel
all
three
roses
must
have
been
planned
at
about
the
same
time
perhaps
by
the
same
architect
within
the
same
workshop
yet
the
western
rose
stands
quite
apart
as
though
it
had
been
especially
designed
to
suit
the
facade
and
portal
which
it
rules
whether
this
was
really
the
artist
idea
is
a
question
that
needs
the
artist
to
answer
but
that
this
is
the
effect
needs
no
expert
to
prove
it
stares
one
in
the
face
within
and
without
one
feels
that
the
spirit
is
respected
and
preserved
with
the
same
religious
feeling
which
obliged
the
architect
to
injure
his
own
work
by
sparing
that
of
his
grandfathers
conspicuous
then
in
the
west
front
are
two
feelings
respect
for
the
work
and
passion
for
the
rose
fenestration
both
subordinated
to
the
demand
for
light
if
it
worries
you
to
have
to
believe
that
these
three
things
are
in
fact
one
that
the
architect
is
listening
like
the
stone
abraham
for
orders
from
the
virgin
while
he
caresses
and
sacrifices
his
child
that
mary
and
not
her
architects
built
this
facade
if
the
divine
intention
seems
to
you
a
needless
impertinence
you
can
soon
get
free
from
it
by
going
to
any
of
the
later
churches
where
you
will
not
be
forced
to
see
any
work
but
that
of
the
architect
compasses
according
to
the
inspiration
ceased
about
or
as
the
virgin
would
have
dated
it
on
the
death
of
blanche
of
castile
in
the
work
of
chartres
where
her
own
hand
is
plainly
shown
belongs
in
feeling
if
not
in
execution
to
the
last
years
of
the
twelfth
century
the
great
western
rose
which
gives
the
motive
for
the
whole
decoration
and
is
repeated
in
the
great
roses
of
the
transepts
marks
the
virgin
will
the
taste
and
knowledge
of
cele
qui
la
rose
est
des
roses
or
if
you
prefer
the
latin
of
adam
de
the
hand
of
her
who
is
super
rosam
rosida
all
this
is
easy
but
if
you
really
can
not
see
the
hand
of
mary
herself
in
these
broad
and
public
courts
which
were
intended
not
for
her
personal
presence
but
for
the
use
of
her
common
people
you
had
better
stop
here
and
not
venture
into
the
choir
great
halls
seem
to
have
been
easy
architecture
naves
and
transepts
were
not
often
failures
facades
and
even
towers
and
fleches
are
invariably
more
or
less
successful
because
they
are
more
or
less
balanced
mathematical
calculable
products
of
reason
and
thought
the
most
serious
difficulties
began
only
with
the
choir
and
even
then
did
not
become
desperate
until
the
architect
reached
the
curve
of
the
apse
with
its
impossible
vaultings
its
complicated
lines
its
its
double
problems
internal
and
external
its
defective
roofing
and
unequal
lighting
a
perfect
gothic
apse
was
impossible
an
apse
that
satisfied
perfectly
its
principal
objects
was
rare
the
simplest
and
cheapest
solution
was
to
have
no
apse
at
all
and
that
was
the
english
scheme
which
was
tried
also
at
laon
a
square
flat
wall
and
window
if
the
hunt
for
norman
towers
offered
a
summer
amusement
a
hunt
for
apses
would
offer
an
education
but
it
would
lead
far
out
of
france
indeed
it
would
be
simpler
to
begin
at
once
with
sancta
sophia
at
constantinople
san
vitale
at
ravenna
and
monreale
at
palermo
and
the
churches
at
torcello
and
murano
and
san
marco
at
venice
and
admit
that
no
device
has
ever
equalled
the
startling
and
mystical
majesty
of
the
byzantine
with
its
marvellous
mosaic
madonna
dominating
the
church
from
the
entrance
with
her
imperial
and
divine
presence
unfortunately
the
northern
churches
needed
light
and
the
northern
architects
turned
their
minds
to
a
desperate
effort
for
a
new
apse
the
scheme
of
the
cathedral
at
laon
seems
to
have
been
rejected
unanimously
the
bare
flat
wall
at
the
end
of
the
choir
was
an
eyesore
it
was
quite
bad
enough
at
the
end
of
the
nave
and
became
annoying
at
the
end
of
the
transepts
so
that
at
noyon
and
soissons
the
architect
with
a
keen
sense
of
interior
form
had
rounded
the
transept
ends
but
though
external
needs
might
require
a
square
transept
the
unintelligence
of
the
flat
wall
became
insufferable
at
the
east
end
neither
did
the
square
choir
suit
the
church
ceremonies
and
processions
or
offer
the
same
advantages
of
arrangement
as
the
french
understood
them
with
one
voice
the
french
architects
seem
to
have
rejected
the
laon
experiment
and
turned
back
to
a
solution
taken
directly
from
the
romanesque
illustration
with
caption
quite
early
in
the
eleventh
century
a
whole
group
of
churches
had
been
built
in
auvergne
at
clermont
and
issoire
for
example
possibly
by
one
architect
with
a
circular
apse
breaking
out
into
five
apsidal
chapels
tourists
who
get
down
as
far
south
as
toulouse
see
another
example
of
this
romanesque
apse
in
the
famous
church
of
saint
sernin
of
the
twelfth
century
and
few
critics
take
offence
at
one
liking
it
indeed
as
far
as
concerns
the
exterior
one
might
even
risk
thinking
it
more
charming
than
the
exterior
of
any
gothic
apse
ever
built
many
of
these
romanesque
apses
of
the
eleventh
and
twelfth
centuries
still
remain
in
france
showing
themselves
in
unsuspected
parish
churches
here
and
there
but
always
a
surprise
for
their
quiet
unobtrusive
grace
making
a
harmony
with
the
romanesque
tower
if
there
is
one
into
which
they
rise
as
at
saint
sernin
but
all
these
churches
had
only
one
aisle
and
in
the
interior
there
came
invariable
trouble
when
the
vaults
rose
in
height
the
architect
of
chartres
in
could
get
no
direct
help
from
these
or
even
from
paris
which
was
a
beautifully
perfect
apse
but
had
no
apsidal
chapels
the
earliest
apse
that
could
have
served
as
a
suggestion
for
chartres
or
at
least
as
a
point
of
observation
for
us
was
that
of
the
abbey
church
of
which
we
went
to
see
in
paris
and
which
is
said
to
date
from
about
here
is
a
circular
choir
surrounded
by
two
rows
of
columns
irregularly
spaced
with
circular
chapels
outside
which
seems
to
have
been
more
or
less
what
the
architect
of
chartres
for
the
virgin
purposes
had
set
his
heart
on
obtaining
closely
following
the
scheme
of
came
the
scheme
of
the
abbey
church
at
vezelay
built
about
here
the
vaulting
sprang
directly
from
the
last
arch
of
the
choir
as
is
shown
on
the
plan
and
bearing
first
on
the
light
columns
of
the
choir
which
were
evenly
spaced
then
fell
on
a
row
of
heavier
columns
outside
which
were
also
evenly
spaced
and
came
to
rest
at
last
on
massive
piers
between
which
were
five
circular
chapels
the
plan
shows
at
a
glance
that
this
arrangement
stretched
the
second
row
of
columns
far
apart
and
that
a
church
much
larger
than
vezelay
would
need
to
space
them
so
much
farther
apart
that
the
arch
uniting
them
would
have
to
rise
indefinitely
while
if
beyond
this
another
aisle
were
added
outside
the
piers
finally
would
require
impossible
vaulting
illustration
with
caption
vezelay
the
problem
stood
thus
when
the
great
cathedrals
were
undertaken
and
the
architect
of
paris
boldly
grappled
with
the
double
aisle
on
a
scale
requiring
a
new
scheme
here
in
spite
of
the
most
virtuous
resolutions
not
to
be
technical
we
must
attempt
a
technicality
because
without
it
one
of
the
most
interesting
eccentricities
of
chartres
would
be
lost
once
more
as
the
architect
did
not
want
to
give
the
interior
bays
of
the
apse
spaces
between
the
columns
aa
less
than
that
of
the
parallel
bays
bb
it
followed
that
the
first
radiating
bay
gave
a
first
space
lmgh
which
was
difficult
to
vault
and
a
second
space
hgef
which
was
impossible
for
how
establish
an
arch
from
f
to
e
even
if
round
its
key
would
have
risen
much
higher
than
the
key
of
the
pointed
archivolt
lm
as
the
second
radiating
bay
opened
out
still
wider
the
difficulty
was
increased
the
builder
therefore
inserted
the
two
intermediate
pillars
o
and
p
between
the
columns
of
the
second
aisle
h

and

which
he
supported

the
outside

the
church

one
corresponding

there
is
no
need
to
point
out
continued
as
though
he
much
suspected
that
there
might
be
need
of
pointing
out
what
skill
this
system
showed
and
how
much
the
art
of
architecture
had
already
been
developed
in
the

de
france
toward
the
end
of
the
twelfth
century
to
what
an
extent
the
unity
of
arrangement
and
style
preoccupied
the
artists
of
that
province
in
fact
the
arrangement
seems
mathematically
and
technically
perfect
at
all
events
we
know
too
little
to
criticize
it
yet
one
would
much
like
to
be
told
why
it
was
not
repeated
by
any
other
architect
or
in
any
other
church
apparently
the
parisians
themselves
were
not
quite
satisfied
with
it
since
they
altered
it
a
hundred
years
later
in
in
order
to
build
out
chapels
between
the
piers
as
the
architects
of
each
new
cathedral
had
in
the
interval
insisted
on
apsidal
chapels
one
may
venture
to
guess
that
the
paris
scheme
hampered
the
services
at
chartres
the
church
services
are
mary
own
tastes
the
church
is
mary
and
the
chapels
are
her
private
rooms
she
was
not
pleased
with
the
arrangements
made
for
her
in
her
palace
at
paris
they
were
too
architectural
too
regular
and
mathematical
too
popular
too
impersonal
and
she
rather
abruptly
ordered
her
architect
at
chartres
to
go
back
to
the
old
arrangement
the
apse
at
paris
was
hardly
covered
with
its
leading
before
the
architect
of
chartres
adopted
a
totally
new
plan
which
according
to
does
him
little
credit
but
which
was
plainly
imposed
on
him
like
the
portal
not
only
had
it
nothing
of
the
mathematical
correctness
and
precision
of
the
paris
scheme
easy
to
understand
and
imitate
but
it
carried
even
a
sort
of
violence
a
wrench
in
its
system
as
though
the
virgin
had
said
with
her
grand
byzantine
air
i
will
it
illustration
with
caption
chartres
at
chartres
said
the
choir
of
the
cathedral
presents
a
plan
which
does
no
great
honour
to
its
architect
there
is
want
of
accord
between
the
circular
apse
and
the
parallel
sides
of
the
sanctuary
the
spacings
of
the
columns
of
the
second
collateral
are
loose
laches
the
vaults
quite
poorly
combined
and
in
spite
of
the
great
width
of
the
spaces
between
the
columns
of
the
second
aisle
the
architect
had
still
to
narrow
those
between
the
interior
columns
the
plan
shows
that
from
the
first
the
architect
must
have
deliberately
rejected
the
paris
scheme
he
must
have
begun
by
narrowing
the
spaces
between
his
inner
columns
then
with
a
sort
of
violence
he
fitted
on
his
second
row
of
columns
and
finally
he
showed
his
motive
by
constructing
an
outer
wall
of
an
original
or
unusual
shape
any
woman
would
see
at
once
the
secret
of
all
this
ingenuity
and
effort
the
chartres
apse
enormous
in
size
and
width
is
exquisitely
lighted
here
as
everywhere
throughout
the
church
the
windows
give
the
law
but
here
they
actually
take
place
of
law
the
virgin
herself
saw
to
the
lighting
of
her
own
boudoir
according
to
chartres
differs
from
all
the
other
great
cathedrals
by
being
built
not
for
its
nave
or
even
for
its
choir
but
for
its
apse
it
was
planned
not
for
the
people
or
the
court
but
for
the
queen
not
a
church
but
a
shrine
and
the
shrine
is
the
apse
where
the
queen
arranged
her
light
to
please
herself
and
not
her
architect
who
had
already
been
sacrificed
at
the
western
portal
and
who
had
a
free
hand
only
in
the
nave
and
transepts
where
the
queen
never
went
and
which
from
her
own
apartment
she
did
not
even
see

this
is
in
effect
what
says
in
his
professional
language
which
is
perhaps
or
sounds
more
reasonable
to
tourists
whose
imaginations
are
hardly
equal
to
the
effort
of
fancying
a
real
deity
perhaps
indeed
one
might
get
so
high
as
to
imagine
a
real
bishop
of
laon
who
should
have
ordered
his
architect
to
build
an
enormous
hall
of
religion
to
rival
the
immense
abbeys
of
the
day
and
to
attract
the
people
as
though
it
were
a
clubroom
there
they
were
to
see
all
the
great
sights
church
ceremonies
theatricals
political
functions
there
they
were
to
do
business
and
frequent
society
they
were
to
feel
at
home
in
their
church
because
it
was
theirs
and
did
not
belong
to
a
priesthood
or
to
rome
jealousy
of
rome
was
a
leading
motive
of
gothic
architecture
and
rome
repaid
it
in
full
the
bishop
of
laon
conceded
at
least
a
transept
to
custom
or
tradition
but
the
archbishop
of
bourges
abolished
even
the
transept
and
the
great
hall
had
no
special
religious
expression
except
in
the
circular
apse
with
its
chapels
which
laon
had
abandoned
one
can
hardly
decide
whether
laon
or
bourges
is
the
more
popular
industrial
political
or
in
other
words
the
less
religious
but
the
parisians
as
the
plan
of
has
shown
were
quite
as
advanced
as
either
and
only
later
altered
their
scheme
into
one
that
provided
chapels
for
religious
service

purposes
the

may
stand

be
taken
for

as

orthodox
all

that

of
the
glory
which
stands
behind
the

of

and
gives
it
quality
and
feeling
of
its
own
for

the

it
is
not
by

but
by
the
virgin
if
this
imperial
presence
is
stamped
on
the
architecture
and
the

with
an
energy
not
to
be

it
radiates
through

loses

in
reasoning
about
what

plod
on

choosing

about

with

that

the

of
the

is
the
oldest
in
the

if
the

beneath

with

was
built
in
the
twenty
or
thirty
years
before
the

could
not
be
much
later
it
goes
with
the
abbe
suger
glass
at
which
was
surely
made
as
early
as
since
the
abbe
was
a
long
time
at
work
on
it
before
he
died
in
their
perfection
proves
what
his
biographer
asserted
that
the
abbe
suger
spent
many
years
as
well
as
much
money
on
his
windows
at
and
the
specialists
affirm
that
the
three
lancets
at
chartres
are
quite
as
good
as
what
remains
of
suger
work
and
paul
durand
the
government
expert
are
positive
that
this
glass
is
the
finest
ever
made
as
far
as
record
exists
and
that
the
northern
lancet
representing
the
tree
of
jesse
stands
at
the
head
of
all
glasswork
whatever
the
windows
claim
therefore
to
be
the
most
splendid
colour
decoration
the
world
ever
saw
since
no
other
material
neither
silk
nor
gold
and
no
opaque
colour
laid
on
with
a
brush
can
compare
with
translucent
glass
and
even
the
ravenna
mosaics
or
chinese
porcelains
are
darkness
beside
them
the
claim
may
not
be
modest
but
it
is
none
of
ours
must
answer
for
his
own
sins
and
he
chose
the
lancet
window
of
the
tree
of
jesse
for
the
subject
of
his
lecture
on
glass
in
general
as
the
most
complete
and
perfect
example
of
this
greatest
decorative
art
once
more
in
following
him
one
is
dragged
in
spite
of
self
into
technique
and
what
is
worse
into
a
colour
world
whose
technique
was
forgotten
five
hundred
years
ago
tried
to
recover
it
after
studying
our
best
french
windows
he
cautiously
suggests
that
one
might
maintain
as
their
secret
of
harmony
that
the
first
condition
for
an
artist
in
glass
is
to
know
how
to
manage
blue
the
blue
is
the
light
in
windows
and
light
has
value
only
by
opposition
the
radiating
power
of
blue
is
therefore
the
and
on
this
matter
has
much
to
say
which
a
student
would
need
to
master
but
a
tourist
never
should
study
or
he
ceases
to
be
a
tourist
and
it
is
enough
for
us
if
we
know
that
to
get
the
value
they
wanted
the
artists
hatched
their
blues
with
lines
covered
their
surface
with
figures
as
though
with
screens
and
tied
their
blue
within
its
own
field
with
narrow
circlets
of
white
or
yellow
which
in
their
turn
were
beaded
to
fasten
the
blue
still
more
firmly
in
its
place
we
have
chiefly
to
remember
the
law
that
blue
is
light
but
also
it
is
that
luminous
colour
which
gives
value
to
all
others
if
you
compose
a
window
in
which
there
shall
be
no
blue
you
will
get
a
dirty
or
dull
blafard
or
crude
surface
which
the
eye
will
instantly
avoid
but
if
you
put
a
few
touches
of
blue
among
all
these
tones
you
will
immediately
get
striking
effects
if
not
skilfully
conceived
harmony
so
the
composition
of
blue
glass
singularly
preoccupied
the
glassworkers
of
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
if
there
is
only
one
red
two
yellows
two
or
three
purples
and
two
or
three
greens
at
the
most
there
are
infinite
shades
of
blue
and
these
blues
are
placed
with
a
very
delicate
observation
of
the
effects
they
should
produce
on
other
tones
and
other
tones
on
them
took
the
window
of
the
tree
of
jesse
as
his
first
illustration
of
the
rule
for
the
reason
that
its
blue
ground
is
one
continuous
strip
from
top
to
bottom
with
the
subordinate
red
on
either
side
and
a
border
uniting
the
whole
so
plainly
that
no
one
can
fail
to
see
its
object
or
its
method
the
blue
tone
of
the
principal
subject
that
is
to
say
the
ground
of
the
tree
of
jesse
has
commanded
the
tonality
of
all
the
rest
this
medium
was
necessary
to
enable
the
luminous
splendour
to
display
its
energy
this
primary
condition
had
dictated
the
red
ground
for
the
prophets
and
the
return
to
the
blue
on
reaching
the
outside
semicircular
band
to
give
full
value
both
to
the
vigour
of
the
red
and
to
the
radiating
transparency
of
the
blue
the
ground
of
the
corners
is
put
in
emerald
green
but
then
in
the
corners
themselves
the
blue
is
recalled
and
is
given
an
additional
solidity
of
value
by
the
delicate
ornamentation
of
the
squares
this
translation
is
very
free
but
one
who
wants
to
know
these
windows
must
read
the
whole
article
and
read
it
here
in
the
church
the
dictionary
in
one
hand
and
binocle
in
the
other
for
the
binocle
is
more
important
than
the
dictionary
when
it
reaches
the
complicated
border
which
repeats
in
detail
the
of
the
centre
the
border
repeats
all
the
tones
allotted
to
the
principal
subjects
but
by
small
fragments
so
that
this
border
with
an
effect
both
solid
and
powerful
shall
not
enter
into
rivalry
with
the
large
arrangements
of
the
central
parts
one
would
think
this
simple
enough
easily
tested
on
any
illuminated
manuscript
arab
persian
or
byzantine
verified
by
any
oriental
rug
old
or
new
freely
illustrated
by
any
chinese
pattern
on
a
ming
jar
or
cloisonne
vase
and
offering
a
kind
of
alphabet
for
the
of
a
paris
modiste
a
strong
red
a
strong
and
a
weak
yellow
a
strong
and
a
weak
purple
a
strong
and
a
weak
green
are
all
to
be
tied
together
given
their
values
and
held
in
their
places
by
blue
the
thing
seems
simpler
still
when
it
appears
that
perspective
is
forbidden
and
that
these
glass
windows
of
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
like
oriental
rugs
imply
a
flat
surface
a
wall
which
must
not
be
treated
as
open

glassworker
would
sooner
have
worn
a
landscape
on
his
back
than
have
costumed
his
church
with
it
he
would
as
soon
have
decorated
his
floors
with
painted
holes
as
his
walls
he
wanted
to
keep
the
coloured
window
flat
like
a
rug
hung
on
the
wall
the
radiation
of
translucent
colours
in
windows
can
not
be
modified
by
the
artist
all
his
talent
consists
in
profiting
by
it
according
to
a
given
harmonic
scheme
on
a
single
plane
like
a
rug
but
not
according
to
an
effect
of
aerial
perspective
do
what
you
like
a
glass
window
never
does
and
never
can
represent
anything
but
a
plane
surface
its
real
virtues
even
exist
only
on
that
condition
every
attempt
to
present
several
planes
to
the
eye
is
fatal
to
the
harmony
of
colour
without
producing
any
illusion
in
the
spectator
translucid
painting
can
propose
as
its
object
only
a
design
supporting
as
energetically
as
possible
a
harmony
of
colours
whether
this
law
is
absolute
you
can
tell
best
by
looking
at
modern
glass
which
is
mostly
perspective
but
whether
you
like
it
or
not
the
matter
of
perspective
does
not
enter
into
a
window
more
than
into
a
japanese
picture
and
may
be
ignored
the
decoration
of
the
twelfth
century
as
far
as
concerns
us
was
intended
only
for
one
plane
and
a
window
was
another
form
of
rug
or
embroidery
or
mosaic
hung
on
the
wall
for
colour
simple
decoration
to
be
seen
as
a
whole
if
the
tree
of
jesse
teaches
anything
at
all
it
is
that
the
artist
thought
first
of
controlling
his
light
but
he
wanted
to
do
it
not
in
order
to
dim
the
colours
on
the
contrary
he
toiled
like
a
jeweller
setting
diamonds
and
rubies
to
increase
their
splendour
if
his
use
of
blue
teaches
this
lesson
his
use
of
green
proves
it
the
outside
border
of
the
tree
of
jesse
is
a
sort
of
sample
which
our
schoolmaster
sets
from
which
he
requires
us
to
study
out
the
scheme
beginning
with
the
treatment
of
light
and
ending
with
the
value
of
the
emerald
green
ground
in
the
corners
complicated
as
the
border
of
the
tree
of
jesse
is
it
has
its
mates
in
the
borders
of
the
two
other
windows
and
a
few
of
the
in
the
side
aisles
but
the
southern
of
the
three
lancets
shows
how
the
artists
dealt
with
a
difficulty
that
upset
their
rule
the
border
of
the
southern
window
does
not
count
as
it
should
something
is
wrong
with
it
and
a
little
study
shows
that
the
builder
and
not
the
glassworker
was
to
blame
owing
to
his
miscalculation
if
it
was
really
a
miscalculation
in
the
width
of
the
southern
tower
the
builder
economized
six
or
eight
inches
in
the
southern
door
and
lancet
which
was
enough
to
destroy
the
balance
between
the
as
masses
of
the
south
and
north
windows
the
artist
was
obliged
to
choose
whether
he
would
sacrifice
the
centre
or
the
border
of
his
southern
window
and
decided
that
the
windows
could
not
be
made
to
balance
if
he
narrowed
the
centre
but
that
he
must
balance
them
by
enriching
the
centre
and
sacrificing
the
border
he
has
filled
the
centre
with
medallions
as
rich
as
he
could
make
them
and
these
he
has
surrounded
with
borders
which
are
also
enriched
to
the
utmost
but
these
medallions
with
their
borders
spread
across
the
whole
window
and
when
you
search
with
the
binocle
for
the
outside
border
you
see
its
pattern
clearly
only
at
the
top
and
bottom
on
the
sides
at
intervals
of
about
two
feet
the
medallions
cover
and
interrupt
it
but
this
is
partly
corrected
by
making
the
border
where
it
is
seen
so
rich
as
to
surpass
any
other
in
the
cathedral
even
that
of
the
tree
of
jesse
whether
the
artist
has
succeeded
or
not
is
a
question
for
other
artists
or
for
you
if
you
please
to
decide
but
apparently
he
did
succeed
since
no
one
has
ever
noticed
the
difficulty
or
the
device
the
southern
lancet
represents
the
passion
of
christ
granting
to
that
the
unbroken
vertical
of
the
tree
of
jesse
made
the
more
effective
window
one
might
still
ask
whether
the
is
not
the
more
interesting
once
past
the
workshop
there
can
be
no
question
about
it
the
tree
of
jesse
has
the
least
interest
of
all
the
three
windows
a
genealogical
tree
has
little
value
artistic
or
other
except
to
those
who
belong
in
its
branches
and
the
tree
of
jesse
was
put
there
not
to
please
us
but
to
please
the
virgin
the
passion
window
was
also
put
there
to
please
her
but
it
tells
a
story
and
does
it
in
a
way
that
has
more
novelty
than
the
subject
the
draughtsman
who
chalked
out
the
design
on
the
whitened
table
that
served
for
his
was
either
a
greek
or
had
before
him
a
byzantine
missal
or
enamel
or
ivory
the
first
medallion
on
these
legendary
windows
is
the
lower
one
which
begins
the
story
or
legend
here
it
represents
christ
after
the
manner
of
the
greek
church
in
the
next
medallion
is
the
last
supper
the
fish
on
the
dish
is
greek
in
the
middle
of
the
window
with
the
help
of
the
binocle
you
will
see
a
crucifixion
or
even
two
for
on
the
left
is
christ
on
the
cross
and
on
the
right
a
descent
from
the
cross
in
this
is
the
figure
of
man
pulling
out
with
pincers
the
nails
which
fasten
christ
feet
a
figure
unknown
to
western
religious
art
the
noli
me
tangere
on
the
right
near
the
top
has
a
sort
of
greek
character
all
the
critics
especially
paul
durand
have
noticed
this
byzantine
look
which
is
even
more
marked
in
the
suger
window
at
so
as
to
suggest
that
both
are
by
the
same
hand
and
that
the
hand
of
a
greek
if
the
artist
was
really
a
greek
he
has
done
work
more
beautiful
than
any
left
at
byzantium
and
very
far
finer
than
anything
in
the
beautiful
work
at
cairo
but
although
the
figures
and
subjects
are
more
or
less
greek
like
the
sculptures
on
the
portal
the
art
seems
to
be
french
look
at
the
central
window
naturally
there
sits
the
virgin
with
her
genealogical
tree
on
her
left
and
her
son
testimony
on
her
right
to
prove
her
double
divinity
she
is
seated
in
the
long
halo
as
on
the
western
portal
directly
beneath
her
her
son
is
represented
in
stone
her
crown
and
head
as
well
as
that
of
the
child
are
restorations
more
or
less
like
the
original
but
her
cushioned
throne
and
her
robes
of
imperial
state
as
well
as
the
flowered
sceptre
in
either
hand
are
as
old
as
the
sculpture
of
the
portal
and
redolent
of
the
first
crusade
on
either
side
of
her
the
sun
and
the
moon
offer
praise
her
two
archangels
michael
and
gabriel
with
resplendent
wings
offer
not
incense
as
in
later
times
but
the
two
sceptres
of
spiritual
and
temporal
power
while
the
child
in
her
lap
repeats
his
action
and
even
her
features
and
expression
at
first
sight
one
would
take
for
granted
that
all
this
was
pure
byzantium
and
perhaps
it
is
but
it
has
rather
the
look
of
byzantium
gallicized
and
carried
up
to
a
poetic
french
ideal
at
the
little
figure
of
the
abbe
suger
at
the
feet
of
the
virgin
has
a
very
oriental
look
and
in
the
twin
medallion
the
virgin
resembles
greatly
the
virgin
of
chartres
yet
for
us
until
some
specialist
shows
us
the
byzantine
original
the
work
is
as
thoroughly
french
as
the
fleches
of
the
churches
byzantine
art
is
altogether
another
chapter
and
if
we
could
but
take
a
season
to
study
it
in
byzantium
we
might
get
great
amusement
but
the
art
of
chartres
even
in
was
french
and
perfectly
french
as
the
architecture
shows
and
the
glass
is
even
more
french
than
the
architecture
as
you
can
detect
in
many
other
ways
perhaps
the
surest
evidence
is
the
glass
itself
the
men
who
made
it
were
not
professionals
but
amateurs
who
may
have
had
some
knowledge
of
enamelling
but
who
worked
like
jewellers
unused
to
glass
and
with
the
refinement
that
a
reliquary
or
a
crozier
required
the
cost
of
these
windows
must
have
been
extravagant
one
is
almost
surprised
that
they
are
not
set
in
gold
rather
than
in
lead
the
abbe
suger
shirked
neither
trouble
nor
expense
and
the
only
serious
piece
of
evidence
that
this
artist
was
a
greek
is
given
by
his
biographer
who
unconsciously
shows
that
the
artist
cheated
him
he
sought
carefully
for
makers
of
windows
and
workmen
in
glass
of
exquisite
quality
especially
in
that
made
of
sapphires
in
great
abundance
that
were
pulverized
and
melted
up
in
the
glass
to
give
it
the
blue
colour
which
he
delighted
to
admire
the
materia
saphirorum
was
evidently
something
precious
as
precious
as
crude
sapphires
would
have
been
and
the
words
imply
beyond
question
that
the
artist
asked
for
sapphires
and
that
suger
paid
for
them
yet
all
specialists
agree
that
the
stone
known
as
sapphire
if
ground
could
not
produce
translucent
colour
at
all
the
blue
which
suger
loved
and
which
is
probably
the
same
as
that
of
these
chartres
windows
can
not
be
made
out
of
sapphires
probably
the
materia
saphirorum
means
cobalt
only
but
whatever
it
was
the
glassmakers
seem
to
agree
that
this
glass
of
is
the
best
ever
made
paul
durand
in
his
official
report
of
said
that
these
windows
both
artistically
and
mechanically
were
of
the
highest
class
i
will
also
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
glass
and
the
execution
of
the
painting
are
materially
speaking
of
a
quality
much
superior
to
windows
of
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
centuries
having
passed
several
months
in
contact
with
these
precious
works
when
i
copied
them
i
was
able
to
convince
myself
of
their
superiority
in
every
particular
especially
in
the
upper
parts
of
the
three
windows
he
said
that
they
were
perfect
and
irreproachable
the
true
enthusiast
in
glass
would
in
the
depths
of
his
heart
like
to
say
outright
that
these
three
windows
are
worth
more
than
all
that
the
french
have
since
done
in
colour
from
that
day
to
this
but
the
matter
concerns
us
chiefly
because
it
shows
how
french
the
experiment
was
and
how
suger
taste
and
wealth
made
it
possible
certain
it
is
too
that
the
southern
window
the
passion
was
made
on
the
spot
or
near
by
and
fitted
for
the
particular
space
with
care
proportionate
to
its
cost
all
are
marked
by
the
hand
of
the
chartres
virgin
they
are
executed
not
merely
for
her
but
by
her
at
the
abbe
suger
appeared
it
is
true
that
he
was
prostrate
at
her
feet
but
still
he
appeared
at
chartres
no
one
no
suggestion
of
a
human
agency
was
allowed
to
appear
the
virgin
permitted
no
one
to
approach
her
even
to
adore
she
is
enthroned
above
as
queen
and
empress
and
mother
with
the
symbols
of
exclusive
and
universal
power
below
her
she
permitted
the
world
to
see
the
glories
of
her
earthly
life
the
annunciation
visitation
and
nativity
the
magi
king
herod
the
journey
to
egypt
and
the
single
medallion
which
shows
the
gods
of
egypt
falling
from
their
pedestals
at
her
coming
is
more
entertaining
than
a
whole
gallery
of
oil
paintings
in
all
france
there
exist
barely
a
dozen
good
specimens
of
century
glass
besides
these
windows
at
chartres
and
the
fragments
at
there
are
windows
at
le
mans
and
angers
and
bits
at
vendome
chalons
poitiers
rheims
and
bourges
here
and
there
one
happens
on
other
pieces
but
the
earliest
is
the
best
because
the
were
new
at
the
work
and
spent
on
it
an
infinite
amount
of
trouble
and
money
which
they
found
to
be
unnecessary
as
they
gained
experience
even
in
the
value
of
these
windows
was
so
well
understood
relatively
to
new
ones
that
they
were
preserved
with
the
greatest
care
the
effort
to
make
such
windows
was
never
repeated
their
jewelled
perfection
did
not
suit
the
scale
of
the
vast
churches
of
the
thirteenth
century
by
turning
your
head
toward
the
windows
of
the
side
aisles
you
can
see
the
criticism
which
the
later
artists
passed
on
the
old
work
they
found
it
too
refined
too
brilliant
too
for
the
size
of
the
new
cathedral
the
play
of
light
and
colour
allowed
the
eye
too
little
repose
indeed
the
eye
could
not
see
their
whole
beauty
and
half
their
value
was
thrown
away
in
this
huge
stone
setting
at
best
they
must
have
seemed
astray
on
the
bleak
cold
windy
plain
of
beauce
homesick
for
palestine
or
cairo
yearning
for
monreale
or
venice
but
this
is
not
our
affair
and
under
the
protection
of
the
empress
virgin
saint
bernard
himself
could
have
afforded
to
sin
even
to
drunkenness
of
colour
with
trifling
expense
of
imagination
one
can
still
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
crusades
in
the
glory
of
the
glass
the
longer
one
looks
into
it
the
more
overpowering
it
becomes
until
one
begins
almost
to
feel
an
echo
of
what
our
two
hundred
and
fifty
million
arithmetical
ancestors
drunk
with
the
passion
of
youth
and
the
splendour
of
the
virgin
have
been
calling
to
us
from
michel
and
chartres
no
words
and
no
wine
could
revive
their
emotions
so
vividly
as
they
glow
in
the
purity
of
the
colours
the
limpidity
of
the
blues
the
depth
of
the
red
the
intensity
of
the
green
the
complicated
harmonies
the
sparkle
and
splendour
of
the
light
and
the
quiet
and
certain
strength
of
the
mass
with
too
strong
direct
sun
the
windows
are
said
to
suffer
and
become
a
cluster
of
jewels
a
delirium
of
coloured
light
the
lines
too
have
different
degrees
of
merit
these
criticisms
seldom
strike
a
chance
traveller
but
he
invariably
makes
the
discovery
that
the
designs
within
the
medallions
are
childish
he
may
easily
correct
them
if
he
likes
and
see
what
would
happen
to
the
window
but
although
this
is
the
alphabet
of
art
and
we
are
past
spelling
words
of
one
syllable
the
criticism
teaches
at
least
one
lesson
primitive
man
seems
to
have
had
a
natural
instinctive
like
the
scent
of
a
dog
society
has
no
right
to
feel
it
as
a
moral
reproach
to
be
told
that
it
has
reached
an
age
when
it
can
no
longer
depend
as
in
childhood
on
its
taste
or
smell
or
sight
or
hearing
or
memory
the
fact
seems
likely
enough
and
in
no
way
sinful
yet
society
always
denies
it
and
is
invariably
angry
about
it
and
therefore
one
had
better
not
say
it
on
the
other
hand
we
can
leave
delacroix
and
his
school
to
fight
out
the
battle
they
began
against
ingres
and
his
school
in
french
art
nearly
a
hundred
years
ago
which
turned
in
substance
on
the
same
point
ingres
held
that
the
first
motive
in
was
line
and
that
a
picture
which
was
well
drawn
was
well
enough
coloured
society
seemed
on
the
whole
to
agree
with
him
society
in
the
twelfth
century
agreed
with
delacroix
the
french
held
then
that
the
first
point
in
was
colour
and
they
never
hesitated
to
put
their
colour
where
they
wanted
it
or
cared
whether
a
green
camel
or
a
pink
lion
looked
like
a
dog
or
a
donkey
provided
they
got
their
harmony
or
value
everything
except
colour
was
sacrificed
to
line
in
the
large
sense
but
details
of
drawing
were
conventional
and
subordinate
so
we
laugh
to
see
a
knight
with
a
blue
face
on
a
green
horse
that
looks
as
though
drawn
by
a
child
and
probably
the
artist
laughed
too
but
he
was
a
colourist
and
never
sacrificed
his
colour
for
a
laugh
we
tourists
assume
commonly
that
he
knew
no
better
in
our
simple
faith
in
ourselves
great
hope
abides
for
it
shows
an
earnestness
hardly
less
than
that
of
the
crusaders
but
in
the
matter
of
colour
one
is
perhaps
less
convinced
or
more
open
to
curiosity
no
school
of
colour
exists
in
our
world
while
the
middle
ages
had
a
dozen
but
it
is
certainly
true
that
these
windows
break
the
french
tradition
they
had
no
antecedent
and
no
fit
succession
all
the
authorities
dwell
on
their
exceptional
character
one
is
sorely
tempted
to
suspect
that
they
were
in
some
way
an
accident
that
such
an
art
could
not
have
sprung
in
such
perfection
out
of
nothing
had
it
been
really
french
that
it
must
have
had
its
home
elsewhere
on
the
rhine
in
italy
in
byzantium
or
in
bagdad
the
same
controversy
has
raged
for
near
two
hundred
years
over
the
gothic
arch
and
everything
else
mediaeval
down
to
the
philosophy
of
the
schools
the
generation
that
lived
during
the
first
and
second
crusades
tried
a
number
of
original
experiments
besides
capturing
jerusalem
among
other
things
it
produced
the
western
portal
of
chartres
with
its
statuary
its
glass
and
its
fleche
as
a
as
it
produced
abelard
saint
bernard
and
christian
of
troyes
whose
acquaintance
we
have
still
to
make
it
took
ideas
wherever
it
found
them
from
germany
italy
spain
constantinople
palestine
or
from
the
source
which
has
always
attracted
the
french
mind
like
a
magnet
from
ancient
greece
that
it
actually
did
take
the
ideas
no
one
disputes
except
perhaps
patriots
who
hold
that
even
the
ideas
were
original
but
to
most
students
the
ideas
need
to
be
accounted
for
less
than
the
taste
with
which
they
were
handled
and
the
quickness
with
which
they
were
developed
that
the
taste
was
french
you
can
see
in
the
architecture
or
you
will
see
if
ever
you
meet
the
gothic
elsewhere
that
it
seized
and
developed
an
idea
quickly
you
have
seen
in
the
arch
the
fleche
the
porch
and
the
windows
as
well
as
in
the
glass
but
what
we
do
not
comprehend
and
never
shall
is
the
appetite
behind
all
this
the
greed
for
novelty
the
fun
of
life
every
one
who
has
lived
since
the
sixteenth
century
has
felt
deep
distrust
of
every
one
who
lived
before
it
and
of
every
one
who
believed
in
the
middle
ages
true
it
is
that
the
last
artist
died
a
long
time
before
our
planet
began
its
present
rate
of
revolution
it
had
to
come
to
rest
and
begin
again
but
this
does
not
prevent
astonishment
that
the
century
planet
revolved
so
fast
the
pointed
arch
not
only
came
as
an
idea
into
france
but
it
was
developed
into
a
system
of
architecture
and
covered
the
country
with
buildings
on
a
scale
of
height
never
before
attempted
except
by
the
dome
with
an
expenditure
of
wealth
that
would
make
a
railway
system
look
cheap
all
in
a
space
of
about
fifty
years
the
glass
came
with
it
and
went
with
it
at
least
as
far
as
concerns
us
but
if
you
need
other
evidence
you
can
consult
renan
who
is
the
highest
authority
one
of
the
most
singular
phenomena
of
the
literary
history
of
the
middle
ages
says
renan
of
averroes
is
the
activity
of
the
intellectual
commerce
and
the
rapidity
with
which
books
were
spread
from
one
end
of
europe
to
the
other
the
philosophy
of
abelard
during
his
lifetime
had
penetrated
to
the
ends
of
italy
the
french
poetry
of
the
trouveres
counted
within
less
than
a
century
translations
into
german
swedish
norwegian
icelandic
flemish
dutch
bohemian
italian
spanish
and
he
might
have
added
that
england
needed
no
translation
but
helped
to
compose
the
poetry
not
being
at
that
time
so
insular
as
she
afterwards
became
such
or
such
a
work
composed
in
morocco
or
in
cairo
was
known
at
paris
and
at
cologne
in
less
time
than
it
would
need
in
our
days
for
a
german
book
of
capital
importance
to
pass
the
rhine
and
renan
wrote
this
in
when
german
books
of
capital
importance
were
revolutionizing
the
literary
world
one
is
apt
to
forget
the
smallness
of
europe
and
how
quickly
it
could
always
be
crossed
in
summer
weather
with
fair
winds
one
can
sail
from
alexandria
or
from
syria
to
sicily
or
even
to
spain
and
france
in
perfect
safety
and
with
ample
room
for
freight
as
easily
now
as
one
could
do
it
then
without
the
aid
of
steam
but
one
does
not
now
carry
freight
of
philosophy
poetry
or
art
the
world
still
struggles
for
unity
but
by
different
methods
weapons
and
thought
the
mercantile
exchanges
which
surprised
renan
and
which
have
puzzled
historians
were
in
ideas
the
twelfth
century
was
as
greedy
for
them
in
one
shape
as
the
nineteenth
century
in
another
france
paid
for
them
dearly
and
repented
for
centuries
but
what
creates
surprise
to
the
point
of
incredulity
is
her
hunger
for
them
the
youthful
gluttony
with
which
she
devoured
them
the
infallible
taste
with
which
she
dressed
them
out
the
restless
appetite
that
snatched
at
the
pointed
arch
the
stone
fleche
the
coloured
glass
the
illuminated
missal
the
chanson
and
roman
and
pastorelle
the
fragments
of
aristotle
the
glosses
of
avicenne
was
nothing
compared
with
the
genius
which
instantly
gave
form
and
flower
to
them
all
this
episode
merely
means
that
the
french
artist
may
be
supposed
to
have
known
his
business
and
if
he
produced
a
grotesque
or
a
saint
or
a
blue
castle
or
a
syllogism
or
a
song
that
he
did
it
with
a
notion
of
the
effect
he
had
in
mind
the
glass
window
was
to
him
a
whole
a
mass
and
its
details
were
his
amusement
for
the
frenchman
enjoyed
his
fun
though
it
was
sometimes
rather
heavy
for
modern
french
taste
and
less
refined
than
the
church
liked
these
three
windows
like
their
contemporary
portal
outside
and
the
fleche
that
goes
with
them
are
the
ideals
of
enthusiasts
of
mediaeval
art
they
are
above
the
level
of
all
known
art
in
religious
form
they
are
inspired
they
are
divine
this
is
the
claim
of
chartres
and
its
virgin
actually
the
french
artist
whether
architect
sculptor
or
painter
in
glass
did
rise
here
above
his
usual
level
he
knew
it
when
he
did
it
and
probably
he
attributed
it
as
we
do
to
the
virgin
for
these
works
of
his
were
hardly
fifty
years
old
when
the
rest
of
the
old
church
was
burned
and
already
the
artist
felt
the
virtue
gone
out
of
him
he
could
not
do
so
well
in
as
he
did
in
and
the
virgin
was
not
so
near
the
proof
of
it
or
if
you
prefer
to
think
so
the
proof
against
it
is
before
our
eyes
on
the
wall
above
the
lancet
windows
when
villard
de
honnecourt
came
to
chartres
he
seized
at
once
on
the
western
rose
as
his
study
although
the
two
other
roses
were
probably
there
in
all
their
beauty
and
lightness
he
saw
in
the
western
rose
some
quality
of
construction
which
interested
him
and
in
fact
the
western
rose
is
one
of
the
flowers
of
architecture
which
reveals
its
beauties
slowly
without
end
but
its
chief
beauty
is
the
feeling
which
unites
it
with
the
portal
the
lancets
and
the
fleche
the
glassworker
here
in
the
interior
had
the
same
task
to
perform
the
glass
of
the
lancets
was
fifty
years
old
when
the
glass
for
the
rose
was
planned
perhaps
it
was
seventy
for
the
exact
dates
are
unknown
but
it
does
not
matter
for
the
greater
the
interval
the
more
interesting
is
the
treatment
whatever
the
date
the
glass
of
the
western
rose
can
not
be
much
earlier
or
much
later
than
that
of
the
other
roses
or
that
of
the
choir
and
yet
you
see
at
a
glance
that
it
is
quite
differently
treated
on
such
matters
one
must
of
course
submit
to
the
opinion
of
artists
which
one
does
the
more
readily
because
they
always
disagree
but
until
the
artists
tell
us
better
we
may
please
ourselves
by
fancying
that
the
glass
of
the
rose
was
intended
to
harmonize
with
that
of
the
lancets
and
unite
it
with
the
glass
of
the
nave
and
transepts
among
all
the
windows
the
western
rose
alone
seems
to
affect
a
rivalry
in
brilliancy
with
the
lancets
and
carries
it
so
far
that
the
separate
medallions
and
pictures
are
quite
lost
especially
in
direct
sunshine
blending
in
a
confused
effect
of
opals
in
a
delirium
of
colour
and
light
with
a
result
like
a
cluster
of
stones
in
jewelry
assuming
as
one
must
in
want
of
the
artist
instruction
that
he
knew
what
he
wanted
to
do
and
did
it
one
must
take
for
granted
that
he
treated
the
rose
as
a
whole
and
aimed
at
giving
it
harmony
with
the
three
precious
windows
beneath
the
effect
is
that
of
a
single
large
ornament
a
round
breastpin
or
what
is
now
called
a
sunburst
of
jewels
with
three
large
pendants
beneath
we
are
ignorant
tourists
liable
to
much
error
in
trying
to
seek
motives
in
artists
who
worked
seven
hundred
years
ago
for
a
society
which
thought
and
felt
in
forms
quite
unlike
ours
but
the
medieval
pilgrim
was
more
ignorant
than
we
and
much
simpler
in
mind
if
the
idea
of
an
ornament
occurs
to
us
it
certainly
occurred
to
him
and
still
more
to
the
glassworker
whose
business
was
to
excite
his
illusions
an
artist
if
good
for
anything
foresees
what
his
public
will
see
and
what
his
public
will
see
is
what
he
ought
to
have
intended
the
measure
of
his
genius
if
the
public
sees
more
than
he
himself
did
this
is
his
credit
if
less
this
is
his
fault
no
matter
how
simple
or
ignorant
we
are
we
ought
to
feel
a
discord
or
a
harmony
where
the
artist
meant
us
to
feel
it
and
when
we
see
a
motive
we
conclude
that
other
people
have
seen
it
before
us
and
that
it
must
therefore
have
been
intended
neither
of
the
transept
roses
is
treated
like
this
one
neither
has
the
effect
of
a
personal
ornament
neither
is
treated
as
a
jewel
no
one
knew
so
well
as
the
artist
that
such
treatment
must
give
the
effect
of
a
jewel
the
roses
of
france
and
of
dreux
bear
indelibly
and
flagrantly
the
character
of
france
and
dreux
on
the
western
rose
is
stamped
with
greater
refinement
but
equal
decision
the
character
of
a
much
greater
power
than
either
of
them
no
artist
would
have
ventured
to
put
up
before
the
eyes
of
mary
in
majesty
above
the
windows
so
dear
to
her
any
object
that
she
had
not
herself
commanded
whether
a
miracle
was
necessary
or
whether
genius
was
enough
is
a
point
of
casuistry
which
you
can
settle
with
albertus
magnus
or
saint
bernard
and
which
you
will
understand
as
little
when
settled
as
before
but
for
us
beyond
the
futilities
of
unnecessary
doubt
the
virgin
designed
this
rose
not
perhaps
in
quite
the
same
perfect
spirit
in
which
she
designed
the
lancets
but
still
wholly
for
her
own
pleasure
and
as
her
own
idea
she
placed
upon
the
breast
of
her
church
which
symbolized
herself
a
jewel
so
gorgeous
that
no
earthly
majesty
could
bear
comparison
with
it
and
which
no
other
heavenly
majesty
has
rivalled
as
one
watches
the
light
play
on
it
one
is
still
overcome
by
the
glories
of
the
jewelled
rose
and
its
three
gemmed
pendants
one
feels
a
little
of
the
effect
she
meant
it
to
produce
even
on
infidels
moors
and
heretics
but
infinitely
more
on
the
men
who
feared
and
the
women
who
adored
her
not
to
dwell
too
long
upon
it
one
admits
that
hers
is
the
only
church
one
would
admit
anything
that
she
should
require
if
you
had
only
the
soul
of
a
shrimp
you
would
crawl
like
the
abbe
suger
to
kiss
her
feet
unfortunately
she
is
gone
or
comes
here
now
so
very
rarely
that
we
never
shall
see
her
but
her
genius
remains
as
individual
here
as
the
genius
of
blanche
of
castile
and
pierre
de
dreux
in
the
transepts
that
the
three
lancets
were
her
own
taste
as
distinctly
as
the
trianon
was
the
taste
of
louis
xiv
is
they
represent
all
that
was
dearest
to
her
her
son
glory
on
her
right
her
own
beautiful
life
in
the
middle
her
royal
ancestry
on
her
left
the
story
of
her
divine
right
the
pictures
are
all
personal
like
family
portraits
above
them
the
man
who
worked
in
to
carry
out
the
harmony
and
to
satisfy
the
wishes
has
filled
his
rose
with
a
dozen
or
two
little
compositions
in
glass
which
reveal
their
subjects
only
to
the
best
powers
of
a
binocle
looking
carefully
one
discovers
at
last
that
this
gorgeous
combination
of
all
the
hues
of
paradise
contains
or
hides
a
last
judgment
the
one
subject
carefully
excluded
from
the
old
work
and
probably
not
existing
on
the
south
portal
for
another
twenty
years
if
the
scheme
of
the
western
rose
dates
from
as
is
reasonable
to
suppose
this
last
judgment
is
the
oldest
in
the
church
and
makes
a
link
between
the
theology
of
the
first
crusade
beneath
and
the
theology
of
pierre
mauclerc
in
the
south
porch
the
churchman
is
the
only
true
and
final
judge
on
his
own
doctrine
and
we
neither
know
nor
care
to
know
the
facts
but
we
are
as
good
judges
as
he
of
the
feeling
and
we
are
at
full
liberty
to
feel
that
such
a
last
judgment
as
this
was
never
seen
before
or
since
by
churchman
or
heretic
unless
by
virtue
of
the
heresy
which
held
that
the
true
christian
must
be
happy
in
being
damned
since
such
is
the
will
of
god
that
this
blaze
of
heavenly
light
was
intended
either
by
the
virgin
or
by
her
workmen
to
convey
ideas
of
terror
or
pain
is
a
notion
which
the
church
might
possibly
preach
but
which
we
sinners
knew
to
be
false
in
the
thirteenth
century
as
well
as
we
know
it
now
never
in
all
these
seven
hundred
years
has
one
of
us
looked
up
at
this
rose
without
feeling
it
to
be
our
lady
promise
of
paradise
here
as
everywhere
else
throughout
the
church
one
feels
the
virgin
presence
with
no
other
thought
than
her
majesty
and
grace
to
the
virgin
and
to
her
suppliants
as
to
us
who
though
outcasts
in
other
churches
can
still
hope
in
hers
the
last
judgment
was
not
a
symbol
of
god
justice
or
man
corruption
but
of
her
own
infinite
mercy
the
trinity
judged
through
christ
christ
loved
and
pardoned
through
her
she
wielded
the
last
and
highest
power
on
earth
and
in
hell
in
the
glow
and
beauty
of
her
nature
the
light
of
her
son
infinite
love
shone
as
the
sunlight
through
the
glass
turning
the
last
judgment
itself
into
the
highest
proof
of
her
divine
and
supreme
authority
the
rudest
ruffian
of
the
middle
ages
when
he
looked
at
this
last
judgment
laughed
for
what
was
the
last
judgment
to
her
an
ornament
a
plaything
a
pleasure
a
jewelled
decoration
which
she
wore
on
her
breast
her
chief
joy
was
to
pardon
her
eternal
instinct
was
to
love
her
deepest
passion
was
pity
on
her
imperial
heart
the
flames
of
hell
showed
only
the
opaline
colours
of
heaven
christ
the
trinity
might
judge
as
much
as
he
pleased
but
christ
the
mother
would
rescue
and
her
servants
could
look
boldly
into
the
flames
if
you
or
even
our
friends
the
priests
who
still
serve
shrine
suspect
that
there
is
some
exaggeration
in
this
language
it
will
only
oblige
you
to
admit
presently
that
there
is
none
but
for
the
moment
we
are
busy
with
glass
rather
than
with
faith
and
there
is
a
world
of
glass
here
still
to
study
technically
we
are
done
with
it
the
technique
of
the
thirteenth
century
comes
naturally
and
only
too
easily
out
of
that
of
the
twelfth
artistically
the
motive
remains
the
same
since
it
is
always
the
virgin
but
although
the
virgin
of
chartres
is
always
the
virgin
of
majesty
there
are
degrees
in
the
assertion
of
her
majesty
even
here
which
affect
the
art
and
qualify
its
feeling
before
stepping
down
to
the
thirteenth
century
one
should
look
at
these
changes
of
the
virgin
royal
presence
first
and
most
important
as
record
is
the
stone
virgin
on
the
south
door
of
the
western
portal
which
we
studied
with
her
byzantine
court
and
the
second
also
in
stone
is
of
the
same
period
on
one
of
the
carved
capitals
of
the
portal
representing
the
adoration
of
the
magi
the
third
is
the
glass
virgin
at
the
top
of
the
central
lancet
all
three
are
undoubted
work
and
you
can
see
another
at
paris
on
the
same
door
of
notre
dame
and
still
more
on
abbe
suger
window
at
and
later
within
a
beautiful
grisaille
at
auxerre
but
all
represent
the
same
figure
a
queen
enthroned
crowned
with
the
symbols
of
royal
power
holding
in
her
lap
the
infant
king
whose
guardian
she
is
without
pretending
to
know
what
special
crown
she
bears
we
can
assume
till
corrected
that
it
is
the
carlovingian
imperial
not
the
byzantine
the
trinity
nowhere
appears
except
as
implied
in
the
christ
at
the
utmost
a
mystic
hand
may
symbolize
the
father
the
virgin
as
represented
by
the
artists
of
the
twelfth
century
in
the
ile
de
france
and
at
chartres
seems
to
be
wholly
french
in
spite
of
the
greek
atmosphere
of
her
workmanship
one
might
almost
insist
that
she
is
blonde
full
in
face
large
in
figure
dazzlingly
beautiful
and
not
more
than
thirty
years
of
age
the
child
never
seems
to
be
more
than
five
you
are
equally
free
to
see
a
southern
or
eastern
type
in
her
face
and
perhaps
the
glass
suggests
a
dark
type
but
the
face
of
the
virgin
on
the
central
lancet
is
a
restoration
which
may
or
may
not
reproduce
the
original
while
all
the
other
virgins
represented
in
glass
except
one
belong
to
the
thirteenth
century
the
possible
exception
is
a
figure
called
in
the
choir
next
the
south
transept
a
strange
almost
uncanny
feeling
seems
to
haunt
this
window
heightened
by
the
veneration
in
which
it
was
long
held
as
a
shrine
though
it
is
now
deserted
for
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
choir
the
charm
is
partly
due
to
the
beauty
of
the
scheme
of
the
angels
supporting
saluting
and
incensing
the
virgin
and
child
with
singular
grace
and
exquisite
feeling
but
rather
that
of
the
thirteenth
than
of
the
twelfth
century
here
too
the
face
of
the
virgin
is
not
ancient
apparently
the
original
glass
was
injured
by
time
or
accident
and
the
colours
were
covered
or
renewed
by
a
simple
drawing
in
oil
elsewhere
the
colour
is
thought
to
be
particularly
good
and
the
window
is
a
favourite
mine
of
motives
for
artists
to
exploit
but
to
us
its
chief
interest
is
its
singular
depth
of
feeling
the
empress
mother
sits
on
a
rich
throne
and
dais
with
the
child
on
her
lap
repeating
her
attitude
except
that
her
hands
support
his
shoulders
she
wears
her
crown
her
feet
rest
on
a
stool
and
both
stool
rug
robe
and
throne
are
as
rich
as
colour
and
decoration
can
make
them
at
last
a
dove
appears
with
the
rays
of
the
holy
ghost
imperial
as
the
virgin
is
it
is
no
longer
quite
the
unlimited
empire
of
the
western
lancet
the
aureole
encircles
her
head
only
she
holds
no
sceptre
the
holy
ghost
seems
to
give
her
support
which
she
did
not
need
before
while
saint
gabriel
and
saint
michael
her
archangels
with
their
symbols
of
power
have
disappeared
exquisite
as
the
angels
are
who
surround
and
bear
up
her
throne
they
assert
no
authority
the
window
itself
is
not
a
single
composition
the
panels
below
seem
inserted
later
merely
to
fill
up
the
space
six
represent
the
marriage
of
cana
and
the
three
at
the
bottom
show
a
grotesque
little
demon
tempting
christ
in
the
desert
the
effect
of
the
whole
in
this
angle
which
is
almost
always
dark
or
filled
with
shadow
is
deep
and
sad
as
though
the
empress
felt
her
authority
fail
and
had
come
down
from
the
western
portal
to
reproach
us
for
neglect
the
face
is
haunting
perhaps
its
force
may
be
due
to
nearness
for
this
is
the
only
instance
in
glass
of
her
descending
so
low
that
we
can
almost
touch
her
and
see
what
the
twelfth
century
instinctively
felt
in
the
features
which
even
in
their
beatitude
were
serious
and
almost
sad
under
the
austere
responsibilities
of
infinite
pity
and
power
no
doubt
the
window
is
very
old
or
perhaps
an
imitation
or
reproduction
of
one
which
was
much
older
but
to
the
pilgrim
its
interest
lies
mostly
in
its
personality
and
there
it
stands
alone
although
the
virgin
reappears
again
and
again
in
the
lower
windows
in
those
on
either
side
of
the
in
the
remnant
of
window
representing
her
miracles
at
chartres
in
the
south
aisle
next
the
transept
in
the
window
of
the
chapel
of
vendome
which
follows
and
in
the
third
window
which
follows
that
of
vendome
and
represents
her
coronation
she
does
not
show
herself
again
in
all
her
majesty
till
we
look
up
to
the
high
windows
above
there
we
shall
find
her
in
her
splendour
on
her
throne
above
the
high
altar
and
still
more
conspicuously
in
the
rose
of
france
in
the
north
transept
still
again
she
is
enthroned
in
the
first
window
of
the
choir
next
the
north
transept
elsewhere
we
can
see
her
standing
but
never
does
she
come
down
to
us
in
the
full
splendour
of
her
presence
yet
wherever
we
find
her
at
chartres
and
of
whatever
period
she
is
always
queen
her
expression
and
attitude
are
always
calm
and
commanding
she
never
calls
for
sympathy
by
hysterical
appeals
to
our
feelings
she
does
not
even
altogether
command
but
rather
accepts
the
voluntary
unquestioning
unhesitating
instinctive
faith
love
and
devotion
of
mankind
she
will
accept
ours
and
we
have
not
the
heart
to
refuse
it
we
have
not
even
the
right
for
we
are
her
guests
chapter
ix
the
legendary
windows
one
first
visit
to
a
great
cathedral
is
like
one
first
visit
to
the
british
museum
the
only
intelligent
idea
is
to
follow
the
order
of
time
but
the
museum
is
a
chaos
in
time
and
the
cathedral
is
generally
all
of
one
and
the
same
time
at
chartres
after
finishing
with
the
twelfth
century
everything
is
of
the
thirteenth
to
catch
even
an
order
in
time
one
must
first
know
what
part
of
the
church
was
oldest
the
books
say
it
was
the
choir
after
the
fire
of
the
pilgrims
used
the
great
crypt
as
a
church
where
services
were
maintained
but
the
builders
must
have
begun
with
the
central
piers
and
the
choir
because
the
choir
was
the
only
essential
part
of
the
church
nave
and
transepts
might
be
suppressed
but
without
a
choir
the
church
was
useless
and
in
a
shrine
such
as
chartres
the
choir
was
the
whole
church
toward
the
choir
then
the
priest
or
artist
looks
first
and
since
dates
are
useful
the
choir
must
be
dated
the
same
popular
enthusiasm
which
had
broken
out
in
revived
in
to
help
the
rebuilding
and
the
work
was
pressed
forward
with
the
same
feverish
haste
so
that
ten
years
should
have
been
ample
to
provide
for
the
choir
if
for
nothing
more
and
services
may
have
been
resumed
there
as
early
as
the
year
certainly
in
probably
the
windows
were
designed
and
put
in
hand
as
soon
as
the
architect
gave
the
measurements
and
any
one
who
intended
to
give
a
window
would
have
been
apt
to
choose
one
of
the
spaces
in
the
apse
in
mary
own
presence
next
the
sanctuary
the
first
of
the
choir
windows
to
demand
a
date
is
the
verriere
which
is
commonly
classed
as
early
and
may
go
with
the
two
windows
next
it
one
of
which
the
zodiac
window
bears
a
singularly
interesting
inscription
comes
teobaldus
dat
ad
preces
comixis
pticensis
if
shakespeare
could
write
the
tragedy
of
king
john
we
can
not
admit
ourselves
not
to
have
read
it
and
this
inscription
might
be
a
part
of
the
play
the
pagus
perticensis
lies
a
short
drive
to
the
west
some
fifteen
or
twenty
miles
on
the
road
to
le
mans
and
in
history
is
known
as
the
comte
du
perche
although
its
memory
is
now
preserved
chiefly
by
its
famous
breed
of
percheron
horses
probably
the
horse
also
dates
from
the
crusades
and
may
have
carried
richard
but
in
any
case
the
count
of
that
day
was
a
vassal
of
richard
and
one
of
his
intimate
friends
whose
memory
is
preserved
forever
by
a
single
line
in
richard
mes
compaignons
cui
et
cui
ces
dou
caheu
et
ces
dou
percherain
in
when
richard
wrote
these
verses
the
comte
du
perche
was
geoffrey
iii
who
had
been
a
companion
of
richard
on
his
crusade
in
where
according
to
the
chronicle
he
shewed
himself
but
a
timid
man
which
seems
scarcely
likely
in
a
companion
of
richard
but
it
is
not
of
him
that
the
chartres
window
speaks
except
as
the
son
of
mahaut
or
matilda
of
champagne
who
was
a
sister
of
alix
of
champagne
queen
of
france
the
table
shows
therefore
that
geoffroi
son
and
successor
as
the
comte
du
perche
thomas
was
second
cousin
of
louis
the
lion
known
as
king
louis
viii
of
france
they
were
probably
of
much
the
same
age
if
this
were
all
one
might
carry
it
in
one
head
for
a
while
but
the
relationship
which
dominates
the
history
of
this
period
was
that
of
all
these
great
ruling
families
with
richard
and
his
brother
john
nicknamed
lackland
both
of
whom
in
succession
were
the
most
powerful
frenchmen
in
france
the
table
shows
that
their
mother
eleanor
of
guienne
the
first
queen
of
louis
vii
bore
him
two
daughters
one
of
whom
alix
married
about
the
count
thibaut
of
chartres
and
blois
while
the
other
mary
married
the
great
count
of
champagne
both
of
them
being
of
and
john
their
children
were
nephews
or
indiscriminately
of
all
the
reigning
monarchs
and
immortalized
one
of
them
by
a
line
in
his
as
he
immortalized
le
perche
je
nel
di
pas
de
celi
de
chartain
la
mere
loeis
loeis
therefore
or
count
louis
of
chatres
was
not
only
nephew
of
and
john
lackland
but
was
also
like
count
thomas
of
le
perche
a
second
cousin
of
louis
viii
feudally
and
personally
he
was
directly
attached
to
rather
than
to
philip
augustus
if
society
in
the
twelfth
century
could
follow
the
effects
of
these
relationships
personal
and
feudal
it
was
cleverer
than
society
in
the
twentieth
but
so
much
is
simple
louis
of
france
thibaut
of
chartres
and
thomas
of
le
perche
were
cousins
and
close
friends
in
the
year
and
all
were
devoted
to
the
virgin
of
chartres
judging
from
the
character
of
louis
future
queen
blanche
of
castile
their
wives
were
if
possible
more
devoted
still
and
in
that
year
blanche
gave
birth
to
saint
louis
who
seems
to
have
been
the
most
devoted
of
all
meanwhile
their
favourite
uncle
had
died
in
the
year
thibaut
eleanor
of
guienne
died
in
king
john
left
to
himself
rapidly
accumulated
enemies
innumerable
abroad
and
at
home
in
philip
augustus
confiscated
all
the
fiefs
he
held
from
the
french
crown
and
in
seized
normandy
john
sank
rapidly
from
worse
to
worst
until
at
last
the
english
barons
rose
and
forced
him
to
grant
their
magna
carta
at
runnimede
in
the
year
was
therefore
a
year
to
be
remembered
at
chartres
as
at
one
of
the
most
convenient
dates
in
history
every
one
is
supposed
even
now
to
know
what
happened
then
to
give
another
violent
wrench
to
society
like
the
norman
conquest
in
john
turned
on
the
barons
and
broke
them
down
they
sent
to
genealogical
chart
showing
the
relationships
among
england
champagne
and
chartres
and
france
and
la
perche
france
for
help
and
offered
the
crown
of
england
to
young
louis
whose
father
philip
augustus
called
a
council
which
pledged
support
to
louis
naturally
the
comte
du
perche
and
the
comte
de
chartres
must
have
pledged
their
support
among
the
foremost
to
go
with
louis
to
england
he
was
then
years
old
they
were
probably
somewhat
younger
the
zodiac
window
with
its
inscription
was
the
immediate
result
the
usual
authority
that
figures
in
the
histories
is
roger
of
wendover
but
much
the
more
amusing
for
our
purpose
is
a
garrulous
frenchman
known
as
the
menestrel
de
rheims
who
wrote
some
fifty
years
later
after
telling
in
his
delightful
french
how
the
english
barons
sent
hostages
to
louis
et
mes

therefore
may
be
supposed
to
have
gone

and
to
have
witnessed
the
disaster
at
lincoln
which
took

such
language
would
be
spoiled
by
translation
for
us
it
is
enough
to
know
that
the
ribaut
who
lifted
the
pan
or
skirt
of
the
count
hauberc
or
as
he
sat
on
his
horse
refusing
to
surrender
to
english
traitors
and
stabbed
him
from
below
with
a
knife
may
have
been
an
invention
of
the
menestrel
or
the
knight
who
pierced
with
his
lance
through
the
visor
to
the
brain
may
have
been
an
invention
of
roger
of
wendover
but
in
either
case
count
thomas
du
perche
lost
his
life
at
lincoln
may
to
the
deepest
regret
of
his
cousin
louis
the
lion
as
well
as
of
the
count
thibaut
of
chartres
whom
he
charged
to
put
up
a
window
for
him
in
honour
of
the
virgin
the
window
must
have
been
ordered
at
once
because
count
thibaut
le
jeune
ou
le
lepreux
died
himself
within
a
year
april
thus
giving
an
exact
date
for
one
of
the
choir
windows
probably
it
was
one
of
the
latest
because
the
earliest
to
be
provided
would
have
been
certainly
those
of
the
central
apsidal
chapel
according
to
the
rule
laid
down
by
the
windows
in
which
blue
strongly
predominates
like
the
saint
sylvester
are
likely
to
be
earlier
than
those
with
a
prevailing
tone
of
red
we
must
take
for
granted
that
some
of
these
great
legendary
windows
were
in
place
as
early
as
because
in
october
of
that
year
philip
augustus
attended
mass
here
there
are
some
two
dozen
of
these
windows
in
the
choir
alone
each
of
which
may
well
have
represented
a
year
work
in
the
slow
processes
of
that
day
and
we
can
hardly
suppose
that
the
workshops
of
were
on
a
scale
such
as
to
allow
of
more
than
two
to
have
been
in
hand
at
once
thirty
or
forty
years
later
when
the
sainte
chapelle
was
built
the
workshops
must
have
been
vastly
enlarged
but
with
the
enlargement
the
glass
deteriorated
therefore
if
the
architecture
were
so
far
advanced
in
the
year
as
to
allow
of
beginning
work
on
the
glass
in
the
apse
the

too
late

in

dates
are
stupidly
annoying
what
we
want
is
not
dates
but
taste
yet
we
are
uncomfortable
without
them
except
the

window
none
of
the
lower
ones
in

helps
at
all
but
the
story
is
more
useful
there

other

of
the

of

and
which
were
removed
by
the
sculptor

in
order
to
obtain
light
for
his
statuary
below
the
donor
was
domina
johannes
baptista
who
we
are
told
was
jeanne
de
dammartin
and
the
window
was
given
in
memory
or
in
honour
of
her
marriage
to
ferdinand
of

a
very
great
lady
daughter
of
the

and
marie
de

her
father
affianced
her
in
to
the

even
caused

to
be
celebrated
by
proxy
but
queen
blanche
broke
it
off
as
she
had
forbidden
in
that
of
yolande
of

she
relented
so
far
as
to
allow

queen
jeanne
returned
to
abbeville

then
at
latest
put
up
this
window
at
chartres
in
memory
of
her
husband
the
windows
numbers
and
are
the
subject
of
much
dispute
but
whether
the
donors
were
jean
de
chatillon
or
the
three
children
of
thibaut
le
grand
of
champagne
they
must
equally
belong
to
the
later
series
of
rather
than
to
the
earlier
of
the
same
thing
is
or
was
true
of
the
next
pair
numbers
and
which
were
removed
in
but
the
record
says
that
at
the
bottom
of
number
was
the
figure
of
saint
louis
son
louis
of
france
who
died
in
before
his
father
who
still
rides
in
the
rose
above
thus
the
north
side
of
the
choir
shows
a
series
of
windows
that
precisely
cover
the
lifetime
of
saint
louis
the
south
side
begins
next
the
apse
with
windows
numbers
and
which
belong
according
to
the
comte
to
the
family
of
montfort
whose
ruined
castle
crowns
the
hill
of
montfort
on
the
road
to
paris
some
forty
kilometres
northeast
of
chartres
every
one
is
supposed
to
know
the
story
of
simon
de
montfort
who
was
killed
before
toulouse
in
simon
left
two
sons
amaury
and
simon
the
sculptor
bridan
put
an
end
also
to
the
window
of
amaury
but
in
the
rose
amaury
according
to
the
abbes
still
rides
on
a
white
horse
amaury
history
is
well
known
he
was
made
constable
of
france
by
queen
blanche
in
went
on
crusade
in
was
captured
by
the
infidels
taken
to
babylon
ransomed
and
in
returning
to
france
died
at
otranto
in
for
that
age
amaury
was
but
a
commonplace
person
totally
overshadowed
by
his
brother
simon
who
went
to
england
married
king
john
daughter
eleanor
and
became
almost
king
himself
as
earl
of
leicester
at
your
leisure
you
can
read
matthew
paris
dramatic
account
of
him
and
of
his
death
at
the
battle
of
evesham
august
he
was
perhaps
the
last
of
the
very
great
men
of
the
thirteenth
century
excepting
saint
louis
himself
who
lived
a
few
years
longer
insists
that
it
is
the
great
earl
of
leicester
who
rides
with
his
visor
up
in
full
armour
on
a
brown
horse
in
the
rose
above
the
windows
numbers
and
in
any
case
the
windows
would
be
later
than
the
next
pair
of
windows
numbers
and
also
removed
in
still
offer
in
their
rose
the
figure
of
a
member
of
the
courtenay
family
gibbon
was
so
much
attracted
by
the
romance
of
the
courtenays
as
to
make
an
amusing
digression
on
the
subject
which
does
not
concern
us
or
the
cathedral
except
so
far
as
it
tells
us
that
the
courtenays
like
so
many
other
benefactors
of
chartres
cathedral
belonged
to
the
royal
blood
who
died
in
besides
his
son
who
married
eleanor
of
guienne
in
that
year
had
a
younger
son
pierre
whom
he
married
to
isabel
de
courtenay
and
who
like
philip
hurepel
took
the
title
of
his
wife
pierre
had
a
son
pierre
ii
who
was
a
cousin
of
philip
augustus
and
became
the
hero
of
the
most
lurid
tragedy
of
the
time
chosen
emperor
of
constantinople
in
to
succeed
his
henry
and
baldwin
he
tried
to
march
across
illyria
and
macedonia
from
durazzo
opposite
brindisi
with
a
little
army
of
five
thousand
men
and
instantly
disappeared
forever
the
epirotes
captured
him
in
the
summer
of
and
from
that
moment
nothing
is
known
of
his
fate
on
the
whole
this
catastrophe
was
perhaps
the
grimmest
of
all
the
shakespearean
tragedies
of
the
thirteenth
century
and
one
would
like
to
think
that
the
chartres
window
was
a
memorial
of
this
pierre
who
was
a
cousin
of
france
and
an
emperor
without
empire
but
insists
that
the
window
was
given
in
memory
not
of
this
pierre
but
of
his
nephew
another
pierre
de
courtenay
seigneur
de
conches
who
went
on
crusade
with
saint
louis
in
to
egypt
and
died
shortly
before
the
defeat
and
captivity
of
the
king
on
february
his
brother
raoul
seigneur
who
died
in
is
said
to
be
donor
of
the
next
window
number
the
date
of
the
courtenay
windows
should
therefore
be
no
earlier
than
the
death
of
saint
louis
in
yet
one
would
like
to
know
what
has
become
of
another
courtenay
window
left
by
the
first
pierre
gaucher
or
gaultier
of
who
seems
to
have
been
vicomte
de
chartres
and
who
dying
before
damietta
in
made
a
will
leaving
to
notre
dame
de
chartres
thirty
silver
marks
de
quibus
fieri
debet
miles
montatus
super
equum
suum
not
only
would
this
mounted
knight
on
horseback
supply
an
early
date
for
these
interesting
figures
but
would
fix
also
the
cost
for
a
mark
contained
eight
ounces
of
silver
and
was
worth
ten
sous
or
half
a
livre
we
shall
presently
see
that
aucassins
gave
twenty
sous
or
a
livre
for
a
strong
ox
so
that
the
miles
montatus
super
equum
suum
in
glass
was
equivalent
to
fifteen
oxen
if
it
were
money
of
paris
which
is
far
from
certain
this
is
an
economical
problem
which
belongs
to
experts
but
the
historical
value
of
these
early
evidences
is
still
something
perhaps
still
as
much
as
ten
sous
all
the
windows
tend
to
the
same
conclusion
even
the
last
pair
numbers
and
offer
three
personal
clues
which
lead
to
the
same
result
the
arms
of
bouchard
de
marly
who
died
in
almost
at
the
same
time
as
louis
viii
a
certain
colinus
or
colin
de
camera
regis
who
was
alive
in
and
robert
of
beaumont
in
the
rose
who
seems
to
be
a
beaumont
of
le
perche
of
whom
little
or
nothing
is
as
yet
certainly
known
as
a
general
rule
there
are
two
series
of
windows
one
figuring
the
companions
or
followers
of
louis
viii
the
other
friends
or
companions
of
saint
louis
queen
blanche
uniting
both
what
helps
to
hold
the
sequences
in
a
certain
order
is
that
the
choir
was
complete
and
services
regularly
resumed
there
in
while
in
the
transept
and
nave
were
finished
and
vaulted
for
the
apside
windows
therefore
we
will
assume
subject
to
correction
a
date
from
to
for
their
design
and
workmanship
for
the
transept
to
and
for
the
nave
a
general
tendency
to
the
actual
reign
of
saint
louis
from
to
since
there
is
a
deal
of
later
glass
scattered
everywhere
among
the
earlier
the
margin
of
error
is
great
but
by
keeping
the
reign
of
louis
viii
and
its
personages
distinct
from
that
of
louis
ix
and
his
generation
we
can
be
fairly
sure
of
our
main
facts
meanwhile
the
sainte
chapelle
in
paris
wholly
built
and
completed
between
and
offers
a
standard
of
comparison
for
the
legendary
windows
the
choir
of
chartres
is
as
long
as
the
nave
and
much
broader
besides
that
the
apse
was
planned
with
seven
circular
projections
which
greatly
increased
the
window
space
so
that
the
guidebook
reckons
windows
a
number
of
these
are
grisailles
and
the
true
amateur
of
glass
considers
the
grisailles
to
be
as
well
worth
study
as
the
legendary
windows
they
are
a
decoration
which
has
no
particular
concern
with
churches
and
no
distinct
religious
meaning
but
it
seems
a
religious
value
which
is
at
some
trouble
to
explain
and
since
his
explanation
is
not
very
technical
we
can
look
at
it
before
looking
at
the
legends
the
colouration
of
the
windows
had
the
advantage
of
throwing
on
the
opaque
walls
a
veil
or
coloured
glazing
of
extreme
delicacy
always
assuming
that
the
coloured
windows
themselves
were
harmoniously
toned
whether
their
resources
did
not
permit
the
artists
to
adopt
a
complete
system
of
coloured
glass
or
whether
they
wanted
to
get
daylight
in
purer
quality
into
their
interiors
whatever
may
have
been
their
reasons
they
resorted
to
this
beautiful
grisaille
decoration
which
is
also
a
colouring
harmony
obtained
by
the
aid
of
a
long
experience
in
the
effects
of
light
on
translucent
surfaces
many
of
our
churches
retain
grisaille
windows
filling
either
all
or
only
a
part
of
their
bays
in
the
latter
case
the
grisailles
are
reserved
for
the
side
windows
which
are
meant
to
be
seen
obliquely
and
in
that
case
the
coloured
glass
fills
the
bays
of
the
fond
the
apsidal
openings
which
are
meant
to
be
seen
in
face
from
a
distance
these
lateral
grisailles
are
still
opaque
enough
to
prevent
the
solar
rays
which
pass
through
them
from
lighting
the
coloured
windows
on
the
reverse
side
yet
at
certain
hours
of
the
day
these
solar
rays
throw
a
pearly
light
on
the
coloured
windows
which
gives
them
indescribable
transparence
and
refinement
of
tones
the
lateral
windows
in
the
choir
of
the
auxerre
cathedral
throw
on
the
wholly
coloured
apsidal
window
by
this
means
a
glazing
the
softness
of
which
one
can
hardly
conceive
the
opaline
light
which
comes
through
these
lateral
bays
and
makes
a
sort
of
veil
transparent
in
the
extreme
under
the
lofty
vaulting
is
crossed
by
the
brilliant
tones
of
the
windows
behind
which
give
the
play
of
precious
stones
the
solid
outlines
then
seem
to
waver
like
objects
seen
through
a
sheet
of
clear
water
distances
change
their
values
and
take
depths
in
which
the
eye
gets
lost
with
every
hour
of
the
day
these
effects
are
altered
and
always
with
new
harmonies
which
one
never
tires
of
trying
to
understand
but
the
deeper
one
study
goes
the
more
astounded
one
becomes
before
the
experience
acquired
by
these
artists
whose
theories
on
the
effects
of
colour
assuming
that
they
had
any
are
unknown
to
us
and
whom
the
most
among
us
treat
as
simple
children
you
can
read
the
rest
for
yourselves
grisaille
is
a
separate
branch
of
which
belongs
with
the
whole
system
of
lighting
and
fenetrage
and
will
have
to
remain
a
closed
book
because
the
feeling
and
experience
which
explained
it
once
are
lost
and
we
can
not
recover
either
such
things
must
have
been
always
felt
rather
than
reasoned
like
the
irregularities
in
plan
of
the
builders
the
best
work
of
the
best
times
shows
the
same
subtlety
of
sense
as
the
dog
shows
in
retrieving
or
the
bee
in
flying
but
which
tourists
have
lost
all
we
can
do
is
to
note
that
the
grisailles
were
intended
to
have
values
they
were
among
the
refinements
of
light
and
colour
with
which
the
apse
of
chartres
is
so
crowded
that
one
must
be
content
to
feel
what
one
can
and
let
the
rest
go
understand
we
can
not
nothing
proves
that
the
greatest
artists
who
ever
lived
have
in
a
logical
sense
understood
or
that
omnipotence
has
ever
understood
or
that
the
utmost
power
of
expression
has
ever
been
capable
of
expressing
more
than
the
reaction
of
one
energy
on
another
but
not
of
two
on
two
and
when
one
sits
here
in
the
central
axis
of
this
complicated
apse
one
sees
in
mere
light
alone
the
reaction
of
hundreds
of
energies
although
time
has
left
only
a
wreck
of
what
the
artist
put
here
one
of
the
best
window
spaces
is
wholly
filled
up
by
the
doorway
to
the
chapel
of
saint
piat
and
only
by
looking
at
the
two
windows
which
correspond
on
the
north
does
a
curious
inquirer
get
a
notion
of
the
probable
loss
the
same
chapel
more
or
less
blocks
the
light
of
three
other
principal
windows
the
sun
the
dust
the
acids
of
dripping
water
and
the
other
works
of
time
have
in
seven
hundred
years
corroded
or
worn
away
or
altered
the
glass
especially
on
the
south
side
windows
have
been
darkened
by
time
and
mutilated
by
wilful
injury
scores
of
the
panels
are
wholly
restored
modern
reproductions
or
imitations
even
after
all
this
loss
the
glass
is
probably
the
or
perhaps
the
only
preserved
part
of
the
decoration
in
colour
for
we
never
shall
know
the
decoration
of
the
vaults
the
walls
the
columns
or
the
floors
only
one
point
is
fairly
sure
that
on
festivals
if
not
at
other
times
every
foot
of
space
was
covered
in
some
way
or
another
throughout
the
apse
with
colour
either
paint
or
tapestry
or
embroidery
or
byzantine
brocades
and
oriental
stuffs
or
rugs
lining
the
walls
covering
the
altars
and
hiding
the
floor
occasionally
you
happen
upon
illuminated
manuscripts
showing
the
interiors
of
chapels
with
their
but
everything
has
perished
here
except
the
glass
if
one
may
judge
from
the
glass
of
later
centuries
the
first
impression
from
the
windows
ought
to
be
disappointment
you
should
find
them
too
effeminate
too
soft
too
small
and
above
all
not
particularly
religious
indeed
except
for
the
nominal
subjects
of
the
legends
one
sees
nothing
religious
about
them
the
medallions
when
studied
with
the
binocle
turn
out
to
be
less
religious
than
decorative
saint
michael
would
not
have
felt
at
home
here
and
saint
bernard
would
have
turned
from
them
with
disapproval
but
when
they
were
put
up
saint
bernard
was
long
dead
and
saint
michael
had
yielded
his
place
to
the
virgin
this
apse
is
all
for
her
at
its
entrance
she
sat
on
either
side
in
the
or
as
our
lady
of
the
pillar
to
receive
the
secrets
and
the
prayers
of
suppliants
who
wished
to
address
her
directly
in
person
there
she
bent
down
to
our
level
resumed
her
humanity
and
felt
our
griefs
and
passions
within
where
the
fell
through
the
wide
columned
space
behind
the
high
altar
was
her
withdrawing
room
where
the
decorator
and
builder
thought
only
of
pleasing
her
the
very
faults
of
the
architecture
and
effeminacy
of
taste
witness
the
artists
object
if
the
glassworkers
had
thought
of
themselves
or
of
the
public
or
even
of
the
priests
they
would
have
strained
for
effects
strong
masses
of
colour
and
striking
subjects
to
impress
the
imagination
nothing
of
the
sort
is
even
suggested
the
great
mosaic
figure
of
the
byzantine
was
a
splendid
religious
effect
but
this
artist
had
in
his
mind
an
altogether
different
thought
he
was
in
the
employ
he
was
decorating
her
own
chamber
in
her
own
palace
he
wanted
to
please
her
and
he
knew
her
tastes
even
when
she
did
not
give
him
her
personal
orders
to
him
a
dream
would
have
been
an
order
the
salary
of
the
artist
was
out
of
all
relation
with
the
percentage
of
a
decorator
the
artist
of
was
probably
the
last
who
cared
little
for
the
baron
not
very
much
for
the
priest
and
nothing
for
the
public
unless
he
happened
to
be
paid
by
the
guild
and
then
he
cared
just
to
the
extent
of
his
hire
or
if
he
was
himself
a
priest
not
even
for
that
his
pay
was
mostly
of
a
different
kind
and
was
the
same
as
that
of
the
peasants
who
were
hauling
the
stone
from
the
quarry
at
bercheres
while
he
was
firing
his
ovens
his
reward
was
to
come
when
he
should
be
promoted
to
decorate
the
queen
of
heaven
palace
in
the
new
jerusalem
and
he
served
a
mistress
who
knew
better
than
he
did
what
work
was
good
and
what
was
bad
and
how
to
give
him
his
right
place
mary
taste
was
infallible
her
knowledge
like
her
power
had
no
limits
she
knew
men
thoughts
as
well
as
acts
and
could
not
be
deceived
probably
even
in
our
own
time
an
artist
might
find
his
imagination
considerably
stimulated
and
his
work
powerfully
improved
if
he
knew
that
anything
short
of
his
best
would
bring
him
to
the
gallows
with
or
without
trial
by
jury
but
in
the
twelfth
century
the
gallows
was
a
trifle
the
queen
hardly
considered
it
a
punishment
for
an
offence
to
her
dignity
the
artist
was
vividly
aware
that
mary
disposed
of
hell
all
this
is
written
in
full
on
every
stone
and
window
of
this
apse
as
legible
as
the
legends
to
any
one
who
cares
to
read
the
artists
were
doing
their
best
not
to
please
a
swarm
of
peasants
or
barons
but
to
satisfy
mary
the
queen
of
heaven
to
whom
the
kings
and
queens
of
france
were
coming
constantly
for
help
and
whose
absolute
power
was
almost
the
only
restraint
recognized
by
emperor
pope
and
clown
the
is
hers
and
hers
alone
for
her
the
lights
are
subdued
the
tones
softened
the
subjects
selected
the
feminine
taste
preserved
that
other
great
ladies
interested
themselves
in
the
matter
even
down
to
its
technical
refinements
is
more
than
likely
indeed
in
the
central
apside
chapel
suggesting
the
auxerre
grisaille
that
mentioned
is
a
grisaille
which
bears
the
arms
of
castile
and
queen
blanche
further
on
three
other
grisailles
bear
also
the
famous
castles
but
this
is
by
no
means
the
strongest
proof
of
feminine
taste
the
difficulty
would
be
rather
to
find
a
touch
of
certainly
masculine
taste
in
the
whole
apse
since
the
central
apside
chapel
is
the
most
important
we
can
begin
with
the
windows
there
bearing
in
mind
that
the
subject
of
the
central
window
was
the
life
of
christ
dictated
by
rule
or
custom
on
christ
left
hand
is
the
window
of
saint
peter
next
him
is
saint
paul
all
are
much
restored
of
the
medallions
are
wholly
new
opposite
saint
peter
at
christ
right
hand
is
the
window
of
saint
simon
and
saint
jude
and
next
is
the
grisaille
with
the
arms
of
castile
if
these
windows
were
ordered
between
and
blanche
who
was
born
in
and
married
in
would
have
been
a
young
princess
of
twenty
or
when
she
gave
this
window
in
grisaille
to
regulate
and
harmonize
and
soften
the
lighting
of
the
virgin
boudoir
the
central
chapel
must
be
taken
to
be
the
most
serious
the
most
studied
and
the
oldest
of
the
chapels
in
the
church
above
the
crypt
the
windows
here
should
rank
in
importance
next
to
the
lancets
of
the
west
front
which
are
only
about
sixty
years
earlier
they
show
fully
that
difference
here
one
must
see
for
one
self
few
artists
know
much
about
it
and
still
fewer
care
for
an
art
which
has
been
quite
dead
these
four
hundred
years
the
ruins
of
nippur
would
hardly
be
more
intelligible
to
the
ordinary
architect
of
english
tradition
than
these
century
efforts
of
the
builders
of
chartres
even
the
learning
of
was
at
fault
in
dealing
with
a
building
so
personal
as
this
the
history
of
which
is
almost
wholly
lost
this
central
chapel
must
have
been
meant
to
give
tone
to
the
apse
and
it
shows
with
the
of
a
queen
salon
a
too
serious
for
the
amusement
of
heretics
one
sees
at
a
glance
that
the
was
inspired
by
while
colour
was
an
experiment
and
the
decorators
of
this
enormous
window
space
were
at
liberty
as
colourists
to
please
the
countess
of
chartres
and
the
princess
blanche
and
the
duchess
of
brittany
without
much
regarding
the
opinions
of
the
late
bernard
of
clairvaux
or
even
augustine
of
hippo
since
the
great
ladies
of
the
court
knew
better
than
the
saints
what
would
suit
the
virgin
the
subject
of
the
central
window
was
prescribed
by
tradition
christ
is
the
church
and
in
this
church
he
and
his
mother
are
one
therefore
the
life
of
christ
is
the
subject
of
the
central
window
but
the
treatment
is
the
virgin
as
the
colours
show
and
as
the
absence
of
every
influence
but
hers
including
the
crucifixion
proves
officially
saint
peter
and
saint
paul
are
in
their
proper
place
as
the
two
great
ministers
of
the
throne
who
represent
the
two
great
parties
in
western
religion
the
jewish
and
the
gentile
opposite
them
balancing
by
their
family
influence
the
weight
of
delegated
power
are
two
of
mary
nephews
simon
and
jude
but
this
subject
branches
off
again
into
matters
so
personal
to
mary
that
simon
and
jude
require
closer
acquaintance
one
must
study
a
new
guidebook
the
golden
legend
by
the
blessed
james
bishop
of
genoa
and
member
of
the
order
of
dominic
who
was
born
at
varazze
or
voragio
in
almost
the
same
year
that
thomas
was
born
at
aquino
and
whose
legenda
aurea
written
about
the
middle
of
the
thirteenth
century
was
more
popular
history
than
the
bible
itself
and
more
generally
consulted
as
authority
the
decorators
of
the
thirteenth
century
got
their
motives
quite
outside
the
bible
in
sources
that
james
of
genoa
compiled
into
a
volume
almost
as
fascinating
as
the
fioretti
of
saint
francis
according
to
the
golden
legend
and
the
tradition
accepted
in
jerusalem
by
pilgrims
and
crusaders
mary
family
connection
was
large
it
appears
that
her
mother
anne
was
three
times
married
and
by
each
husband
had
a
daughter
mary
so
that
there
were
three
marys
christ
james
joseph
simon
jude
james
john
the
minor
the
the
major
the
evangelist
apostle
just
iago
of
compostella
simon
and
jude
were
therefore
nephews
of
mary
and
cousins
of
christ
whose
lives
were
evidence
of
the
truth
not
merely
of
scripture
but
specially
of
the
private
and
family
distinction
of
their
aunt
the
virgin
mother
of
christ
they
were
selected
rather
than
their
brothers
or
cousins
james
and
john
for
the
conspicuous
honour
of
standing
opposite
peter
and
paul
doubtless
by
reason
of
some
merit
of
their
own
but
perhaps
also
because
in
art
the
two
counted
as
one
and
therefore
the
one
window
offered
two
witnesses
which
allowed
the
artist
to
insert
a
grisaille
in
place
of
another
legendary
window
to
complete
the
chapel
on
their
right
according
to
the
grisaille
in
this
position
regulates
the
light
and
so
completes
the
effect
if
custom
prescribed
a
general
rule
for
the
central
chapel
it
seems
to
have
left
great
freedom
in
the
windows
near
by
at
chartres
the
curved
projection
that
contains
the
next
two
windows
was
not
a
chapel
but
only
a
for
the
sake
of
the
windows
and
if
the
artists
aimed
at
pleasing
the
virgin
they
would
put
their
best
work
there
at
bourges
in
the
same
relative
place
are
three
of
the
best
windows
in
the
building
the
prodigal
son
the
new
alliance
and
the
good
samaritan
all
of
them
full
of
life
story
and
colour
with
little
reference
to
a
worship
or
a
saint
at
chartres
the
choice
is
still
more
striking
and
the
windows
are
also
the
best
in
the
building
after
the
glass
of
the
west
front
the
first
which
comes
next
to
blanche
grisaille
in
the
central
chapel
is
given
to
another
nephew
of
mary
and
apostle
of
christ
saint
james
the
major
whose
life
is
recorded
in
the
proper
bible
dictionaries
with
a
terminal
remark
as
follows
for
legends
respecting
his
death
and
his
connections
with
spain
see
the
roman
breviary
in
which
the
healing
of
a
paralytic
and
the
conversion
of
hermogenes
are
attributed
to
him
and
where
it
is
asserted
that
he
preached
the
gospel
in
spain
and
that
his
remains
were
translated
to
compostella
as
there
is
no
shadow
of
foundation
for
any
of
the
legends
here
referred
to
we
pass
them
by
without
further
notice
even
baronius
shows
himself
ashamed
of
them
if
the
learned
baronius
thought
himself
required
to
show
shame
for
all
the
legends
that
pass
as
history
he
must
have
suffered
cruelly
during
his
laborious
life
and
his
sufferings
would
not
have
been
confined
to
the
annals
of
the
church
but
the
historical
accuracy
of
the
glass
windows
is
not
our
affair
nor
are
historians
especially
concerned
in
the
events
of
the
virgin
life
whether
recorded
or
legendary
religion
is
or
ought
to
be
a
feeling
and
the
windows
are
original
documents
much
more
historical
than
any
recorded
in
the
bible
since
their
inspiration
is
a
different
thing
from
their
authority
the
true
life
of
saint
james
or
saint
jude
or
any
other
of
the
apostles
did
not
in
the
opinion
of
the
ladies
in
the
court
of
france
furnish
subjects
agreeable
enough
to
decorate
the
palace
of
the
queen
of
heaven
and
that
they
were
right
any
one
must
feel
who
compares
these
two
windows
with
subjects
of
dogma
saint
james
better
known
as
santiago
of
compostella
was
a
compliment
to
the
young
dauphine
before
dauphines
existed
the
princess
blanche
of
castile
whose
arms
or
castles
are
on
the
grisaille
window
next
to
it
perhaps
she
chose
him
to
stand
there
certainly
her
hand
is
seen
plainly
enough
throughout
the
church
to
warrant
suspecting
it
here
as
a
nephew
saint
james
was
dear
to
the
virgin
but
as
a
friend
to
spain
still
more
dear
to
blanche
and
it
is
not
likely
that
pure
accident
caused
three
adjacent
windows
to
take
a
spanish
tone
the
saint
james
in
whom
the
thirteenth
century
delighted
and
whose
windows
one
sees
at
bourges
tours
and
wherever
the
tells
of
the
pilgrim
belongs
not
to
the
bible
but
to
the
golden
legend
this
window
was
given
by
the
merchant
tailors
whose
signature
appears
at
the
bottom
in
the
corners
in
two
pictures
that
paint
the
tailor
shop
of
chartres
in
the
first
quarter
of
the
thirteenth
century
the
takes
cloth
from
chests
for
his
master
to
show
to
customers
and
to
measure
off
by
his
ell
the
story
of
saint
james
begins
in
the
lower
panel
where
he
receives
his
mission
from
christ
above
on
the
right
he
seems
to
be
preaching
on
the
left
appears
a
figure
which
tells
the
reason
for
the
popularity
of
the
story
it
is
almogenes
or
in
the
latin
hermogenes
a
famous
magician
in
great
credit
among
the
pharisees
who
has
the
command
of
demons
as
you
see
for
behind
his
shoulder
standing
a
little
demon
is
perched
while
he
orders
his
pupil
filetus
to
convert
james
next
james
is
shown
in
discussion
with
a
group
of
listeners
filetus
gives
him
a
volume
of
false
doctrine
almogenes
then
further
instructs
filetus
james
is
led
away
by
a
rope
curing
a
paralytic
as
he
goes
he
sends
his
cloak
to
filetus
to
drive
away
the
demon
filetus
receives
the
cloak
and
the
droll
little
demon
departs
in
tears
almogenes
losing
his
temper
sends
two
demons
with
horns
on
their
heads
and
clubs
in
their
hands
to
reason
with
james
who
sends
them
back
to
remonstrate
with
almogenes
the
demons
then
bind
almogenes
and
bring
him
before
james
who
discusses
differences
with
him
until
almogenes
burns
his
books
of
magic
and
prostrates
himself
before
the
saint
both
are
then
brought
before
herod
and
almogenes
breaks
a
pretty
heathen
idol
while
james
goes
to
prison
a
panel
comes
in
here
out
of
place
showing
almogenes
enchanting
filetus
and
the
demon
entering
into
possession
of
him
then
almogenes
is
seen
being
very
roughly
handled
by
a
young
jew
while
the
bystanders
seem
to
approve
james
next
makes
almogenes
throw
his
books
of
magic
into
the
sea
both
are
led
away
to
execution
curing
the
infirm
on
their
way
their
heads
are
cut
off
and
at
the
top
god
blesses
the
orb
of
the
world
that
this
window
was
intended
to
amuse
the
virgin
seems
quite
as
reasonable
an
idea
as
that
it
should
have
been
made
to
instruct
the
people
or
us
its
humour
was
as
humorous
then
as
now
for
the
french
of
the
thirteenth
century
loved
humour
even
in
churches
as
their
grotesques
proclaim
the
saint
james
window
is
a
tale
of
magic
told
with
the
vivacity
of
a
fabliau
but
if
its
motive
of
amusement
seems
still
a
forced
idea
we
can
pass
on
at
once
to
the
companion
window
which
holds
the
best
position
in
the
church
where
in
the
usual
cathedral
one
expects
to
find
saint
john
or
some
other
apostle
or
saint
joseph
or
a
doctrinal
lesson
such
as
that
called
the
new
alliance
where
the
old
and
new
testaments
are
united
the
window
which
the
artists
have
set
up
here
is
regarded
as
the
best
of
the
windows
and
is
the
least
religious
the
subject
is
nothing
less
than
the
chanson
de
roland
in
pictures
of
coloured
glass
set
in
a
border
worth
comparing
at
leisure
with
the
borders
of
the
western
lancets
even
at
chartres
the
artists
could
not
risk
displeasing
the
virgin
and
the
church
by
following
a
wholly
profane
work
like
the
chanson
itself
and
roland
had
no
place
in
religion
he
could
be
introduced
only
through
charlemagne
who
had
almost
as
little
right
there
as
he
the
twelfth
century
had
made
persistent
efforts
to
get
charlemagne
into
the
church
and
the
church
had
made
very
little
effort
to
keep
him
out
yet
by
the
year
charlemagne
had
not
been
sainted
except
by
the
pascal
iii
in
although
there
was
a
popular
belief
supported
in
spain
by
the
necessary
documents
that
pope
calixtus
ii
in
had
declared
the
chronicle
of
archbishop
turpin
to
be
authentic
the
bishop
of
chartres
in
was
very
much
too
enlightened
a
prelate
to
accept
the
chronicle
or
turpin
or
charlemagne
himself
still
less
roland
and
thierry
as
authentic
in
sanctity
but
if
the
young
and
beautiful
dauphine
of
france
and
her
cousins
of
chartres
and
their
artists
warmly
believed
that
the
virgin
would
be
pleased
by
the
story
of
charlemagne
and
roland
the
bishop
might
have
let
them
have
their
way
in
spite
of
the
irregularity
that
the
window
was
an
irregularity
is
plain
that
it
has
always
been
immensely
admired
is
certain
and
that
bishop
renaud
must
have
given
his
assent
to
it
is
not
to
be
denied
the
most
elaborate
account
of
this
window
can
be
found
in
art
religieux
pp
its
feeling
or
motive
is
quite
another
matter
as
it
is
with
the
statuary
on
the
north
porch
the
furriers
or
fur
merchants
paid
for
the
charlemagne
window
and
their
signature
stands
at
the
bottom
where
a
merchant
shows
a
cloak
to
his
customer
that
mary
was
personally
interested
in
furs
no
authority
seems
to
affirm
but
that
blanche
and
isabel
and
every
lady
of
the
court
as
well
as
every
king
and
every
count
in
that
day
took
keen
interest
in
the
subject
is
proved
by
the
prices
they
paid
and
the
quantities
they
wore
not
even
the
merchant
tailors
had
a
better
standing
at
court
than
the
furriers
which
may
account
for
their
standing
so
near
the
virgin
whatever
the
cause
the
furriers
were
allowed
to
put
their
signature
here
side
by
side
with
the
tailors
and
next
to
the
princess
blanche
their
gift
warranted
it
above
the
signature
in
the
first
panel
the
emperor
constantine
is
seen
asleep
in
constantinople
on
an
elaborate
bed
while
an
angel
is
giving
him
the
order
to
seek
aid
from
charlemagne
against
the
saracens
charlemagne
appears
in
full
armour
of
the
year
on
horseback
then
charlemagne
sainted
wearing
his
halo
converses
with
two
bishops
on
the
subject
of
a
crusade
for
the
rescue
of
constantine
in
the
next
scene
he
arrives
at
the
gates
of
constantinople
where
constantine
receives
him
the
fifth
picture
is
most
interesting
charlemagne
has
advanced
with
his
knights
and
attacks
the
saracens
the
franks
wear
and
carry
long
pointed
shields
the
infidels
carry
round
shields
charlemagne
wearing
a
crown
strikes
off
with
one
blow
of
his
sword
the
head
of
a
saracen
emir
but
the
battle
is
desperate
the
chargers
are
at
full
gallop
and
a
saracen
is
striking
at
charlemagne
with
his
after
the
victory
has
been
won
the
emperor
constantine
rewards
charlemagne
by
the
priceless
gift
of
three
chasses
or
reliquaries
containing
a
piece
of
the
true
cross
the
suaire
or
of
the
saviour
and
a
tunic
of
the
virgin
charlemagne
then
returns
to
france
and
in
the
next
medallion
presents
the
three
chasses
and
the
crown
of
the
saracen
king
to
the
church
at
aix
which
to
a
french
audience
meant
the
abbey
of
this
scene
closes
the
first
volume
of
the
story
the
second
part
opens
on
charlemagne
seated
between
two
persons
looking
up
to
heaven
at
the
milky
way
called
then
the
way
of
saint
james
which
directs
him
to
the
grave
of
saint
james
in
spain
saint
james
himself
appears
to
charlemagne
in
a
dream
and
orders
him
to
redeem
the
tomb
from
the
infidels
then
charlemagne
sets
out
with
archbishop
turpin
of
rheims
and
knights
in
presence
of
his
army
he
dismounts
and
implores
the
aid
of
god
then
he
arrives
before
pampeluna
and
transfixes
with
his
lance
the
saracen
chief
as
he
flies
into
the
city
mounted
he
directs
workmen
to
construct
a
church
in
honour
of
saint
james
a
little
cloud
figures
the
hand
of
god
next
is
shown
the
miracle
of
the
lances
stuck
in
the
ground
at
night
they
are
found
in
the
morning
to
have
burst
into
foliage
prefiguring
martyrdom
two
thousand
people
perish
in
battle
then
begins
the
story
of
roland
which
the
artists
and
donors
are
so
eager
to
tell
knowing
as
they
do
that
what
has
so
deeply
interested
men
and
women
on
earth
must
interest
mary
who
loves
them
you
see
archbishop
turpin
celebrating
mass
when
an
angel
appears
to
warn
him
of
roland
fate
then
roland
himself
also
wearing
a
halo
is
introduced
in
the
act
of
killing
the
giant
ferragus
the
combat
of
roland
and
ferragus
is
at
the
top
out
of
sequence
as
often
happens
in
the
legendary
windows
charlemagne
and
his
army
are
seen
marching
homeward
through
the
pyrenees
while
roland
winds
his
horn
and
splits
the
rock
without
being
able
to
break
durendal
thierry
likewise
sainted
brings
water
to
roland
in
a
helmet
at
last
thierry
announces
roland
death
at
the
top
on
either
side
of
roland
and
ferragus
is
an
angel
with
incense
the
execution
of
this
window
is
said
to
be
superb
of
the
colour
and
its
relations
with
that
of
the
saint
james
one
needs
time
and
long
acquaintance
to
learn
the
value
in
the
feeling
compared
with
that
of
the
twelfth
century
one
needs
no
time
in
order
to
see
a
change
these
two
windows
are
as
french
and
as
modern
as
a
picture
of
lancret
they
are
pure
art
as
simply
decorative
as
the
decorations
of
the
grand
opera
the
thirteenth
century
knew
more
about
religion
and
decoration
than
the
twentieth
century
will
ever
learn
the
windows
were
neither
symbolic
nor
mystical
nor
more
religious
than
they
pretended
to
be
that
they
are
more
intelligent
or
more
costly
or
more
effective
is
nothing
to
the
purpose
so
long
as
one
grants
that
the
combat
of
roland
and
ferragus
or
roland
winding
his
olifant
or
charlemagne
cutting
off
heads
and
transfixing
moors
were
subjects
never
intended
to
teach
religion
or
instruct
the
ignorant
but
to
please
the
queen
of
heaven
as
they
pleased
the
queens
of
earth
with
a
roman
not
in
verse
but
in
colour
as
near
as
possible
to
decorative
perfection
instinctively
one
looks
to
the
corresponding
bay
opposite
to
see
what
the
artists
could
have
done
to
balance
these
two
great
efforts
of
their
art
but
the
bay
opposite
is
now
occupied
by
the
entrance
to
saint
piat
chapel
and
one
does
not
know
what
changes
may
have
been
made
in
the
fourteenth
century
to
rearrange
the
glass
yet
even
as
it
now
stands
the
sylvester
window
which
corresponds
to
the
charlemagne
is
as
glass
the
strongest
in
the
whole
cathedral
in
the
next
chapel
on
our
left
come
the
martyrs
with
saint
stephen
the
first
martyr
in
the
middle
window
naturally
the
subject
is
more
serious
but
the
colour
is
not
differently
treated
a
step
further
and
you
see
the
artists
returning
to
their
lighter
subjects
the
stories
of
saint
julian
and
saint
thomas
are
more
amusing
than
the
plots
of
half
the
romances
and
not
very
much
more
religious
the
subject
of
saint
thomas
is
a
pendant
to
that
of
saint
james
for
saint
thomas
was
a
great
traveller
and
an
architect
who
carried
mary
worship
to
india
as
saint
james
carried
it
to
spain
here
is
the
amusement
of
many
days
in
studying
the
stories
the
colour
and
the
execution
of
these
windows
with
the
help
of
the
monographs
of
chartres
and
bourges
or
the
golden
legend
and
occasional
visits
to
le
mans
tours
clermont
ferrand
and
other
cathedrals
but
in
passing
one
has
to
note
that
the
window
of
saint
thomas
was
given
by
france
and
bears
the
royal
arms
perhaps
for
philip
augustus
the
king
while
the
window
of
saint
julian
was
given
by
the
carpenters
and
coopers
one
feels
no
need
to
explain
how
it
happens
that
the
taste
of
the
royal
family
and
of
their
tailors
furriers
carpenters
and
coopers
should
fit
so
marvellously
one
with
another
and
with
that
of
the
virgin
but
one
can
compare
with
theirs
the
taste
of
the
workers
opposite
in
the
window
of
saint
sylvester
and
saint
melchiades
whose
blues
almost
kill
the
charlemagne
itself
and
of
the
tanners
in
that
of
saint
thomas
of
canterbury
or
in
the
last
chapel
on
the
south
side
with
that
of
the
shoemakers
in
the
window
to
saint
martin
attributed
for
some
reason
to
a
certain
clemens
vitrearius
carnutensis
whose
name
is
on
a
window
in
the
cathedral
of
rouen
the
name
tells
nothing
even
if
the
identity
could
be
proved
clement
the
glassmaker
may
have
worked
on
his
own
account
or
for
others
the
glass
differs
only
in
refinements
of
taste
or
perhaps
of
cost
nicolas
lescine
the
canon
or
geoffroi
chardonnel
may
have
been
less
rich
than
the
bakers
and
even
the
furriers
may
have
not
had
the
revenues
of
the
king
but
some
controlling
hand
has
given
more
or
less
identical
taste
to
all
what
one
can
least
explain
is
the
reason
why
some
windows
that
should
be
here
are
elsewhere
in
most
churches
one
finds
in
the
choir
a
window
of
doctrine
such
as
the
new
alliance
but
here
the
new
alliance
is
banished
to
the
nave
besides
the
costly
charlemagne
and
saint
james
windows
in
the
apse
the
furriers
and
drapers
gave
several
others
and
one
of
these
seems
particularly
suited
to
serve
as
companion
to
saint
thomas
saint
james
and
saint
julian
so
that
it
is
best
taken
with
these
while
comparing
them
it
is
in
the
nave
the
third
window
from
the
new
tower
in
the
north
aisle
the
window
of
saint
eustace
the
story
and
treatment
and
beauty
of
the
work
would
have
warranted
making
it
a
pendant
to
almogenes
in
the
bay
now
serving
as
the
door
to
saint
chapel
which
should
have
been
the
most
effective
of
all
the
positions
in
the
church
for
a
legendary
story
saint
eustace
whose
name
was
placidas
commanded
the
guards
of
the
emperor
trajan
one
day
he
went
out
hunting
with
huntsmen
and
hounds
as
the
legend
in
the
lower
panel
of
the
window
begins
a
pretty
picture
of
a
stag
hunt
about
the
year
followed
by
one
still
prettier
where
the
stag
after
leaping
upon
a
rock
has
turned
and
shows
a
crucifix
between
his
horns
the
stag
on
one
side
balancing
the
horse
on
the
other
while
placidas
on
his
knees
yields
to
the
miracle
of
christ
then
placidas
is
baptized
as
eustace
and
in
the
centre
you
see
him
with
his
wife
and
two
children
another
charming
composition
leaving
the
city
four
small
panels
in
the
corners
are
said
to
contain
the
signatures
of
the
drapers
and
furriers
above
the
story
of
adventure
goes
on
showing
eustace
bargaining
with
a
shipmaster
for
his
passage
his
embarcation
with
wife
and
children
and
their
arrival
at
some
shore
where
the
two
children
have
landed
and
the
master
drives
eustace
after
them
while
he
detains
the
wife
four
small
panels
here
have
not
been
identified
but
the
legend
was
no
doubt
familiar
to
the
middle
ages
and
they
knew
how
eustace
and
the
children
came
to
a
river
where
you
can
see
a
pink
lion
carrying
off
one
child
while
a
wolf
which
has
seized
the
other
is
attacked
by
shepherds
and
dogs
the
children
are
rescued
and
the
wife
reappears
on
her
knees
before
her
lord
telling
of
her
escape
from
the
shipmaster
while
the
children
stand
behind
and
then
the
reunited
family
restored
to
the
emperor
favour
is
seen
feasting
and
happy
at
last
eustace
refuses
to
offer
a
sacrifice
to
a
graceful
antique
idol
and
is
then
shut
up
with
all
his
family
in
a
brazen
bull
a
fire
is
kindled
beneath
it
and
from
above
a
hand
confers
the
crown
of
martyrdom
another
subject
which
should
have
been
placed
in
the
apse
stands
in
a
singular
isolation
which
has
struck
many
of
the
students
in
this
branch
of
church
learning
at
sens
saint
eustace
is
in
the
choir
and
by
his
side
is
the
prodigal
son
at
bourges
also
the
prodigal
son
is
in
the
choir
at
chartres
he
is
banished
to
the
north
transept
where
you
will
find
him
in
the
window
next
the
nave
almost
as
though
he
were
in
disgrace
yet
the
glass
is
said
to
be
very
fine
among
the
best
in
the
church
while
the
story
is
told
with
rather
more
vivacity
than
usual
and
as
far
as
colour
and
execution
go
the
window
has
an
air
of
age
and
quality
higher
than
the
average
at
the
bottom
you
see
the
signature
of
the
corporation
of
butchers
the
window
at
bourges
was
given
by
the
tanners
the
story
begins
with
the
picture
showing
the
younger
son
asking
the
father
for
his
share
of
the
inheritance
which
he
receives
in
the
next
panel
and
proceeds
on
horseback
to
spend
as
one
can
not
help
suspecting
at
paris
in
the
latin
quarter
where
he
is
seen
arriving
welcomed
by
two
ladies
no
one
has
offered
to
explain
why
chartres
should
consider
two
ladies
theologically
more
correct
than
one
or
why
sens
should
fix
on
three
or
why
bourges
should
require
six
perhaps
this
was
left
to
the
artist
fancy
but
before
quitting
the
twelfth
century
we
shall
see
that
the
usual
young
man
who
took
his
share
of
patrimony
and
went
up
to
study
in
the
latin
quarter
found
two
schools
of
scholastic
teaching
one
called
realism
the
other
nominalism
each
of
which
in
turn
the
church
had
been
obliged
to
condemn
meanwhile
the
prodigal
son
is
seen
feasting
with
them
and
is
crowned
with
flowers
like
a
new
abelard
singing
his
songs
to
heloise
until
his
religious
capital
is
exhausted
and
he
is
dragged
out
of
bed
to
be
driven
naked
from
the
house
with
sticks
in
this
also
i
resembling
abelard
at
bourges
he
is
gently
turned
out
at
sens
he
is
dragged
away
by
three
devils
then
he
seeks
service
and
is
seen
knocking
acorns
from
boughs
to
feed
his
employer
swine
but
among
the
thousands
of
young
men
who
must
have
come
here
directly
from
the
schools
nine
in
every
ten
said
that
he
was
teaching
letters
to
his
employer
children
or
lecturing
to
the
students
of
the
latin
quarter
at
last
he
decides
to
return
to
his
father
possibly
the
archbishop
of
paris
or
the
abbot
of
who
receives
him
with
open
arms
and
gives
him
a
new
robe
which
to
the
ribald
student
would
mean
a
church
living
an
abbey
perhaps
saint
in
brittany
or
elsewhere
the
fatted
calf
is
killed
the
feast
is
begun
and
the
elder
son
whom
the
malicious
student
would
name
bernard
appears
in
order
to
make
protest
above
god
on
his
throne
blesses
the
globe
of
the
world
the
original
symbol
of
the
prodigal
son
was
a
rather
different
form
of
prodigality
according
to
the
church
interpretation
the
father
had
two
sons
the
older
was
the
people
of
the
jews
the
younger
the
gentiles
the
father
divided
his
substance
between
them
giving
to
the
older
the
divine
law
to
the
younger
the
law
of
nature
the
younger
went
off
and
dissipated
his
substance
as
one
must
believe
on
aristotle
but
repented
and
returned
when
the
father
sacrificed
the
victim
christ
as
the
symbol
of
reunion
that
the
synagogue
also
accepts
the
sacrifice
is
not
so
clear
but
the
church
clung
to
the
idea
of
converting
the
synagogue
as
a
necessary
proof
of
christ
divine
character
not
until
about
the
time
when
this
window
may
have
been
made
did
the
new
church
under
the
influence
of
saint
dominic
abandon
the
jews
and
turn
in
despair
to
the
gentiles
alone
the
old
symbolism
belonged
to
the
fourth
and
fifth
centuries
and
as
told
by
the
jesuit
fathers
martin
and
cahier
in
their
monograph
of
bourges
it
should
have
pleased
the
virgin
who
was
particularly
loved
by
the
young
and
habitually
showed
her
attachment
to
them
at
bourges
the
window
stands
next
the
central
chapel
of
the
apse
where
at
chartres
is
the
entrance
to
saint
piat
chapel
but
bourges
did
not
belong
to
notre
dame
nor
did
sens
the
story
of
the
prodigal
sons
of
these
years
from
to
lends
the
window
a
little
personal
interest
that
the
prodigal
son
of
saint
luke
gospel
could
hardly
have
had
even
to
penitents
neither
the
church
nor
the
crown
loved
prodigal
sons
so
far
from
killing
fatted
calves
for
them
the
bishops
in
burned
no
less
than
ten
in
paris
for
too
great
intimacy
with
arab
and
jew
disciples
of
aristotle
the
position
of
the
bishop
of
chartres
between
the
schools
had
been
always
awkward
as
for
blanche
of
castile
her
first
son
afterwards
saint
louis
was
born
in
and
after
that
time
no
prodigal
son
was
likely
to
be
welcomed
in
any
society
which
she
frequented
for
her
above
all
other
women
on
earth
or
in
heaven
prodigal
sons
felt
most
antipathy
until
in
the
quarrel
became
so
violent
that
she
turned
her
police
on
them
and
beat
a
number
to
death
in
the
streets
they
retaliated
without
regard
for
loyalty
or
decency
being
far
from
model
youth
and
prone
to
relapses
from
virtue
even
when
forgiven
and
beneficed
the
virgin
mary
queen
of
heaven
showed
no
prejudice
against
prodigal
sons
or
even
prodigal
daughters
she
would
hardly
of
her
own
accord
have
ordered
such
persons
out
of
her
apse
when
saint
stephen
at
bourges
and
sens
showed
no
such
puritanism
yet
the
chartres
window
is
put
away
in
the
north
transept
even
there
it
still
stands
opposite
the
virgin
of
the
pillar
on
the
women
and
queen
blanche
side
of
the
church
and
in
an
excellent
position
better
seen
from
the
choir
than
some
of
the
windows
in
the
choir
itself
because
the
late
summer
sun
shines
full
upon
it
and
carries
its
colours
far
into
the
apse
this
may
have
been
one
of
the
many
instances
of
tastes
in
the
virgin
which
were
almost
too
imperial
for
her
official
court
omniscient
as
mary
was
she
knew
no
difference
between
the
blanches
of
castile
and
the
students
of
the
latin
quarter
she
was
rather
fond
of
prodigals
and
gentle
toward
the
ladies
who
consumed
the
prodigal
substance
she
admitted
mary
magdalen
and
mary
the
gipsy
to
her
society
she
fretted
little
about
aristotle
so
long
as
the
prodigal
adored
her
and
naturally
the
prodigal
adored
her
almost
to
the
exclusion
of
the
trinity
she
always
cared
less
for
her
dignity
than
was
to
be
wished
especially
in
the
nave
and
on
the
porch
among
the
peasants
she
liked
to
appear
as
one
of
themselves
she
insisted
on
lying
in
bed
in
a
stable
with
the
cows
and
asses
about
her
and
her
baby
in
a
cradle
by
the
bedside
as
though
she
had
suffered
like
other
women
though
the
church
insisted
she
had
not
her
husband
saint
joseph
was
notoriously
uncomfortable
in
her
court
and
always
preferred
to
get
as
near
to
the
door
as
he
could
the
choir
at
chartres
on
the
contrary
was
aristocratic
every
window
there
had
a
court
quality
even
down
to
the
contemporary
thomas
the
fashionable
martyr
of
good
society
theology
was
put
into
the
transepts
or
still
further
away
in
the
nave
where
the
window
of
the
new
alliance
elbows
the
prodigal
son
even
to
blanche
of
castile
mary
was
neither
a
philanthropist
nor
theologist
nor
merely
a
mother
she
was
an
absolute
empress
and
whatever
she
said
was
obeyed
but
sometimes
she
seems
to
have
willed
an
order
that
worried
some
of
her
most
powerful
servants
mary
chose
to
put
her
prodigal
into
the
transept
and
one
would
like
to
know
the
reason
was
it
a
concession
to
the
bishop
or
the
queen
or
was
it
to
please
the
common
people
that
these
familiar
books
with
their
popular
interest
like
the
good
samaritan
and
the
prodigal
son
were
put
on
the
walls
of
the
great
public
hall
this
can
hardly
be
since
the
people
would
surely
have
preferred
the
charlemagne
and
saint
james
to
any
other
we
shall
never
know
but
sitting
here
in
the
subdued
afternoon
light
of
the
apse
one
goes
on
for
hours
reading
the
open
volumes
of
colour
and
listening
to
the
steady
discussion
by
the
architects
artists
priests
princes
and
princesses
of
the
thirteenth
century
about
the
arrangements
of
this
apse
however
they
might
be
each
in
turn
whether
priest
or
noble
or
glassworker
would
have
certainly
appealed
to
the
virgin
and
one
can
imagine
the
architect
still
beside
us
in
the
growing
dusk
of
evening
mentally
praying
as
he
looked
at
the
work
of
a
finished
day
lady
virgin
show
me
what
you
like
best
the
central
chapel
is
correct
i
know
the
lady
blanche
grisaille
veils
the
rather
strong
blue
tone
nicely
and
i
am
confident
it
will
suit
you
the
charlemagne
window
seems
to
me
very
successful
but
the
bishop
feels
not
at
all
easy
about
it
and
i
should
never
have
dared
put
it
here
if
the
lady
blanche
had
not
insisted
on
a
spanish
bay
to
balance
at
once
both
the
subjects
and
the
colour
we
have
tried
the
stephen
window
in
the
next
chapel
with
more
red
but
if
saint
stephen
is
not
good
enough
to
satisfy
you
we
have
tried
again
with
saint
julian
whose
story
is
really
worth
telling
you
as
we
tell
it
and
with
him
we
have
put
saint
thomas
because
you
loved
him
and
gave
him
your
girdle
i
do
not
myself
care
so
very
much
for
saint
thomas
of
canterbury
opposite
though
the
count
is
wild
about
it
and
the
bishop
wants
it
but
the
sylvester
is
stupendous
in
the
morning
sun
what
troubles
me
most
is
the
first
bay
the
princesses
would
not
have
let
me
put
the
prodigal
son
there
even
if
it
were
made
for
the
place
i
nothing
else
good
enough
to
balance
the
charlemagne
unless
it
be
the
eustace
gracious
lady
what
ought
i
to
do
forgive
me
my
blunders
my
stupidity
my
wretched
want
of
taste
and
feeling
i
love
and
adore
you
all
that
i
am
i
am
for
you
if
i
can
not
please
you
i
care
not
for
heaven
but
without
your
help
i
am
lost
upon
my
word
you
may
sit
here
forever
imagining
such
appeals
and
the
endless
discussions
and
criticisms
that
were
heard
every
day
under
these
vaults
seven
hundred
years
ago
that
the
virgin
answered
the
questions
is
my
firm
belief
just
as
it
is
my
conviction
that
she
did
not
answer
them
elsewhere
one
sees
her
personal
presence
on
every
side
any
one
can
feel
it
who
will
only
consent
to
feel
like
a
child
sitting
here
any
sunday
afternoon
while
the
voices
of
the
children
of
the
maitrise
are
chanting
in
the
choir
your
mind
held
in
the
grasp
of
the
strong
lines
and
shadows
of
the
architecture
your
eyes
flooded
with
the
autumn
tones
of
the
glass
your
ears
drowned
with
the
purity
of
the
voices
one
sense
reacting
upon
another
until
sensation
reaches
the
limit
of
its
range
you
or
any
other
lost
soul
could
if
you
cared
to
look
and
listen
feel
a
sense
beyond
the
human
ready
to
reveal
a
sense
divine
that
would
make
that
world
once
more
intelligible
and
would
bring
the
virgin
to
life
again
in
all
the
depths
of
feeling
which
she
shows
here
in
lines
vaults
chapels
colours
legends
chants
more
eloquent
than
the
and
more
beautiful
than
the
autumn
sunlight
and
any
one
willing
to
try
could
feel
it
like
the
child
reading
new
thought
without
end
into
the
art
he
has
studied
a
hundred
times
but
what
is
still
more
convincing
he
could
at
will
in
an
instant
shatter
the
whole
art
by
calling
into
it
a
single
motive
of
his
own
chapter
x
the
court
of
the
queen
of
heaven
all
artists
love
the
sanctuary
of
the
christian
church
and
all
tourists
love
the
rest
the
reason
becomes
clear
as
one
leaves
the
choir
and
goes
back
to
the
broad
open
hall
of
the
nave
the
choir
was
made
not
for
the
pilgrim
but
for
the
deity
and
is
as
old
as
adam
or
perhaps
older
at
all
events
old
enough
to
have
existed
in
complete
artistic
and
theological
form
with
the
whole
mystery
of
the
trinity
the
mother
and
child
and
even
the
cross
thousands
of
years
before
christ
was
born
but
the
christian
church
not
only
took
the
sanctuary
in
hand
and
gave
it
a
new
form
more
beautiful
and
much
more
refined
than
the
romans
or
greeks
or
egyptians
had
ever
imagined
but
it
also
added
the
idea
of
the
nave
and
transepts
and
developed
it
into
imperial
splendour
the
feels
at
home
in
the
nave
because
it
was
built
for
him
the
artist
loves
the
sanctuary
because
he
built
it
for
god
chartres
was
intended
to
hold
ten
thousand
people
easily
or
fifteen
thousand
when
crowded
and
the
decoration
of
this
great
space
though
not
a
wholly
new
problem
had
to
be
treated
in
a
new
way
sancta
sofia
was
built
by
the
emperor
justinian
with
all
the
resources
of
the
empire
in
a
single
violent
effort
in
six
years
and
was
decorated
throughout
with
mosaics
on
a
general
scheme
with
the
unity
that
empire
and
church
could
give
when
they
acted
together
the
norman
kings
of
sicily
the
richest
princes
of
the
twelfth
century
were
able
to
carry
out
a
complete
work
of
the
most
costly
kind
in
a
single
sustained
effort
from
beginning
to
end
according
to
a
given
plan
chartres
was
a
local
shrine
in
an
agricultural
province
not
even
a
part
of
the
royal
domain
and
its
cathedral
was
the
work
of
society
without
much
more
tie
than
the
virgin
gave
it
socially
chartres
as
far
as
its
goes
seems
to
have
been
mostly
rural
its
decoration
in
the
porches
and
transepts
is
royal
and
feudal
in
the
nave
and
choir
it
is
chiefly
bourgeois
the
want
of
unity
is
much
less
surprising
than
the
unity
but
it
is
still
evident
especially
in
the
glass
the
mosaics
of
monreale
begin
and
end
they
are
a
series
their
connection
is
artistic
and
theological
at
once
they
have
unity
the
windows
of
chartres
have
no
sequence
and
their
charm
is
in
variety
in
individuality
and
sometimes
even
in
downright
hostility
to
each
other
reflecting
the
picturesque
society
that
gave
them
they
have
too
the
charm
that
the
world
has
made
no
attempt
to
popularize
them
for
its
modern
uses
so
that
except
for
the
useful
little
book
of
the
abbe
clerval
one
can
see
no
clue
to
the
legendary
chaos
one
has
it
to
one
self
without
much
fear
of
being
trampled
upon
by
critics
or
jew
dealers
in
works
of
art
any
chartres
woman
can
still
pass
a
summer
day
here
and
never
once
be
mortified
by
ignorance
of
things
that
every
dealer
in
is
supposed
to
know
yet
the
artists
seem
to
have
begun
even
here
with
some
idea
of
sequence
for
the
first
window
in
the
north
aisle
next
the
new
tower
tells
the
story
of
noah
but
the
next
plunges
into
the
local
history
of
chartres
and
is
devoted
to
saint
lubin
a
bishop
of
this
diocese
who
died
in
or
about
the
year
and
was
for
some
reason
selected
by
the
to
represent
them
as
their
interesting
medallions
show
then
follow
three
amusing
subjects
charmingly
treated
saint
eustace
whose
story
has
been
told
joseph
and
his
brethren
and
saint
nicholas
the
most
popular
saint
of
the
thirteenth
century
both
in
the
greek
and
in
the
roman
churches
the
sixth
and
last
window
on
the
north
aisle
of
the
nave
is
the
new
alliance
opposite
these
in
the
south
aisle
the
series
begins
next
the
tower
with
john
the
evangelist
followed
by
saint
mary
magdalen
given
by
the
the
third
the
good
samaritan
given
by
the
shoemakers
has
a
rival
at
sens
which
critics
think
even
better
the
fourth
is
the
death
assumption
and
coronation
of
the
virgin
then
comes
the
chapel
of
vendome
to
compare
the
early
and
later
glass
the
sixth
is
or
was
devoted
to
the
miracles
at
chartres
but
only
one
complete
subject
remains
these
windows
light
the
two
aisles
of
the
nave
and
decorate
the
lower
walls
of
the
church
with
a
mass
of
colour
and
variety
of
line
still
practically
intact
in
spite
of
much
injury
but
the
windows
of
the
transepts
on
the
same
level
have
almost
disappeared
except
the
prodigal
son
and
a
border
to
what
was
once
a
saint
lawrence
on
the
north
and
on
the
south
part
of
a
window
to
saint
apollinaris
of
ravenna
with
an
interesting
hierarchy
of
angels
above
seraphim
and
cherubim
with
six
wings
red
and
blue
dominations
powers
principalities
all
except
thrones
all
this
seems
to
be
simple
enough
at
least
to
the
people
for
whom
the
nave
was
built
and
to
whom
the
windows
were
meant
to
speak
there
is
nothing
esoteric
here
nothing
but
what
might
have
suited
the
great
hall
of
a
great
palace
there
is
no
difference
in
taste
between
the
virgin
in
the
choir
and
the
by
the
doorway
blanche
the
young
queen
liked
the
same
colours
legends
and
lines
that
her
grocers
and
bakers
liked
all
equally
loved
the
virgin
there
was
not
even
a
social
difference
in
the
choir
thibaut
the
count
of
chartres
immediate
lord
of
the
province
let
himself
be
put
in
a
dark
corner
next
the
belle
verriere
and
left
the
bakers
to
display
their
wealth
in
the
most
serious
spot
in
the
church
the
central
window
of
the
central
chapel
while
in
the
nave
and
transepts
all
the
lower
windows
that
bear
signatures
were
given
by
trades
as
though
that
part
of
the
church
were
abandoned
to
the
commons
one
might
suppose
that
the
feudal
aristocracy
would
have
fortified
itself
in
the
clerestory
and
upper
windows
but
even
there
the
bourgeoisie
invaded
them
and
you
can
see
with
a
glass
the
pastrycooks
and
turners
looking
across
at
the
weavers
and
curriers
and
and
the
men
of
tours
beneath
the
throne
of
the
mother
of
god
there
was
no
distinction
of
gifts
and
above
it
the
distinction
favoured
the
commonalty
of
the
seven
immense
windows
above
and
around
the
high
altar
which
are
designed
as
one
composition
none
was
given
by
a
prince
or
a
noble
the
drapers
the
butchers
the
bakers
the
bankers
are
charged
with
the
highest
duties
attached
to
the
virgin
service
apparently
neither
saint
louis
nor
his
father
louis
viii
nor
his
mother
blanche
nor
his
uncle
philippe
hurepel
nor
his
cousin
saint
ferdinand
of
castile
nor
his
other
cousin
pierre
de
dreux
nor
the
duchess
alix
of
brittany
cared
whether
their
portraits
or
armorial
shields
were
thrust
out
of
sight
into
corners
by
pastrycooks
and
teamsters
or
took
a
whole
wall
of
the
church
to
themselves
the
only
relation
that
connects
them
is
their
common
relation
to
the
virgin
but
that
is
emphatic
and
dominates
the
whole
it
dominates
us
too
if
we
reflect
on
it
even
after
seven
hundred
years
that
its
meaning
has
faded
when
one
looks
up
to
this
display
of
splendour
in
the
clerestory
and
asks
what
was
in
the
minds
of
the
people
who
joined
to
produce
with
such
immense
effort
and
at
such
this
astonishing
effect
the
question
seems
to
answer
itself
like
an
echo
with
only
half
of
an
atrophied
imagination
in
a
happy
mood
we
could
still
see
the
nave
and
transepts
filled
with
ten
thousand
people
on
their
knees
and
the
virgin
crowned
and
robed
seating
herself
on
the
embroidered
cushion
that
covered
her
imperial
throne
sparkling
with
gems
bearing
in
her
right
hand
the
sceptre
and
in
her
lap
the
infant
king
but
in
the
act
of
seating
herself
we
should
see
her
pause
a
moment
to
look
down
with
love
and
sympathy
on
us
her
people
who
pack
the
enormous
hall
and
throng
far
out
beyond
the
open
portals
while
an
instant
later
she
glances
up
to
see
that
her
great
lords
spiritual
and
temporal
the
advisers
of
her
judgment
the
supports
of
her
authority
the
agents
of
her
will
shall
be
in
place
robed
mitred
armed
bearing
the
symbols
of
her
authority
and
their
office
on
horseback
lance
in
hand
all
of
them
ready
at
a
sign
to
carry
out
a
sentence
of
judgment
or
an
errand
of
mercy
to
touch
with
the
sceptre
or
to
strike
with
the
sword
and
never
err
there
they
still
stand
unchanged
unfaded
as
alive
and
complete
as
when
they
represented
the
real
world
and
the
people
below
were
the
unreal
and
ephemeral
pageant
then
the
reality
was
the
queen
of
heaven
on
her
throne
in
the
sanctuary
and
her
court
in
the
glass
not
the
queens
or
princes
who
were
prostrating
themselves
with
the
crowd
at
her
feet
these
people
knew
the
virgin
as
well
as
they
knew
their
own
mothers
every
jewel
in
her
crown
every
stitch
of
in
her
many
robes
every
colour
every
fold
every
expression
on
the
perfectly
familiar
features
of
her
grave
imperial
face
every
care
that
lurked
in
the
silent
sadness
of
her
power
repeated
over
and
over
again
in
stone
glass
ivory
enamel
wood
in
every
room
at
the
head
of
every
bed
hanging
on
every
neck
standing
at
every
the
virgin
was
as
familiar
to
every
one
of
them
as
the
sun
or
the
seasons
far
more
familiar
than
their
own
earthly
queen
or
countess
although
these
were
no
strangers
in
their
daily
life
familiar
from
the
earliest
childhood
to
the
last
agony
in
every
joy
and
every
sorrow
and
every
danger
in
every
act
and
almost
in
every
thought
of
life
the
virgin
was
present
with
a
reality
that
never
belonged
to
her
son
or
to
the
trinity
and
hardly
to
any
earthly
being
prelate
king
or
kaiser
her
daily
life
was
as
real
to
them
as
their
own
loyalty
which
brought
to
her
the
best
they
had
to
offer
as
the
return
for
her
boundless
sympathy
but
while
they
knew
the
virgin
as
though
she
were
one
of
themselves
and
because
she
had
been
one
of
themselves
they
were
not
so
familiar
with
all
the
officers
of
her
court
at
chartres
and
pilgrims
from
abroad
like
us
must
always
have
looked
with
curious
interest
at
the
pageant
far
down
the
nave
next
the
western
towers
the
rank
began
with
saints
prophets
and
martyrs
of
all
ages
and
countries
local
like
saint
lubin
national
like
saint
martin
of
tours
and
saint
hilary
of
poitiers
popular
like
saint
nicholas
militant
like
saint
george
without
order
symbols
like
abraham
and
isaac
the
virgin
herself
holding
on
her
lap
the
seven
gifts
of
the
holy
ghost
christ
with
the
alpha
and
omega
moses
and
saint
augustine
saint
peter
saint
mary
the
egyptian
saint
jerome
a
whole
of
heavenly
powers
repeating
within
the
pageant
carved
on
the
porches
and
on
the
portals
without
from
the
croisee
in
the
centre
where
the
crowd
is
most
dense
one
sees
the
whole
almost
better
than
mary
sees
it
from
her
high
altar
for
there
all
the
great
rose
windows
flash
in
turn
and
the
three
lancets
glow
on
the
western
sun
when
the
eyes
of
the
throng
are
directed
to
the
north
the
rose
of
france
strikes
them
almost
with
a
physical
shock
of
colour
and
from
the
south
the
rose
of
dreux
challenges
the
rose
of
france
every
one
knows
that
there
is
war
between
the
two
the
thirteenth
century
has
few
secrets
there
are
no
outsiders
we
are
one
family
as
we
are
one
church
every
man
and
woman
here
from
mary
on
her
throne
to
the
beggar
on
the
porch
knows
that
pierre
de
dreux
detests
blanche
of
castile
and
that
their
two
windows
carry
on
war
across
the
very
heart
of
the
cathedral
both
unite
only
in
asking
help
from
mary
but
blanche
is
a
woman
alone
in
the
world
with
young
children
to
protect
and
most
women
incline
strongly
to
suspect
that
mary
will
never
desert
her
pierre
with
all
his
masculine
strength
is
no
courtier
he
wants
to
rule
by
force
he
carries
the
assertion
of
his
sex
into
the
very
presence
of
the
queen
of
heaven
the
year
happens
to
be
when
the
roses
may
be
supposed
just
finished
and
showing
their
whole
splendour
for
the
first
time
queen
blanche
is
years
old
and
her
son
louis
is
fifteen
blanche
is
a
widow
these
four
years
and
pierre
a
widower
since
both
are
regents
and
guardians
for
their
heirs
they
have
necessarily
carried
their
disputes
before
mary
queen
blanche
claims
for
her
son
who
is
to
be
saint
louis
the
place
of
honour
at
right
hand
she
has
taken
possession
of
the
north
porch
outside
and
of
the
north
transept
within
and
has
filled
the
windows
with
glass
as
she
is
filling
the
porch
with
statuary
above
is
the
huge
rose
below
are
five
long
windows
and
all
proclaim
the
homage
that
france
renders
to
the
queen
of
heaven
the
rose
of
france
shows
in
its
centre
the
virgin
in
her
majesty
seated
crowned
holding
the
sceptre
with
her
right
hand
while
her
left
supports
the
infant
on
her
knees
which
shows
that
she
too
is
acting
as
regent
for
her
son
round
her
in
a
circle
are
twelve
medallions
four
containing
doves
four
angels
or
thrones
four
angels
of
a
lower
order
but
all
symbolizing
the
gifts
and
endowments
of
the
queen
of
heaven
outside
these
are
twelve
more
medallions
with
the
kings
of
judah
and
a
third
circle
contains
the
twelve
lesser
prophets
so
mary
sits
hedged
in
by
all
the
divinity
that
graces
earthly
or
heavenly
kings
while
between
the
two
outer
circles
are
twelve
quatrefoils
bearing
on
a
blue
ground
the
golden
lilies
of
france
and
in
each
angle
below
the
rose
are
four
openings
showing
alternately
the
lilies
of
louis
and
the
castles
of
blanche
we
who
are
below
the
common
people
understand
that
france
claims
to
protect
and
defend
the
virgin
of
chartres
as
her
chief
vassal
and
that
this
ostentatious
profusion
of
lilies
and
castles
is
intended
not
in
honour
of
france
but
as
a
demonstration
of
loyalty
to
notre
dame
and
an
assertion
of
her
rights
as
queen
regent
of
heaven
against
all
comers
but
particularly
against
pierre
the
rebel
who
has
the
audacity
to
assert
rival
rights
in
the
opposite
transept
beneath
the
rose
are
five
long
windows
very
unlike
the
century
pendants
to
the
western
rose
these
five
windows
blaze
with
red
and
their
splendour
throws
the
virgin
above
quite
into
the
background
the
artists
who
felt
that
the
glass
was
too
fine
and
too
delicate
for
the
new
scale
of
the
church
have
not
only
enlarged
their
scale
and
coarsened
their
design
but
have
coarsened
their
also
discarding
blue
in
order
to
crush
us
under
the
earthly
majesty
of
red
these
windows
too
bear
the
stamp
and
seal
of
blanche
spanish
temper
as
energetically
as
though
they
bore
her
portrait
the
great
central
figure
the
tallest
and
most
commanding
in
the
whole
church
is
not
the
virgin
but
her
mother
saint
anne
standing
erect
as
on
the
trumeau
of
the
door
beneath
and
holding
the
infant
mary
on
her
left
arm
she
wears
no
royal
crown
but
bears
a
flowered
sceptre
the
only
other
difference
between
mary
and
her
mother
that
seems
intended
to
strike
attention
is
that
mary
sits
while
her
mother
stands
but
as
though
to
proclaim
still
more
distinctly
that
france
supports
the
royal
and
divine
pretensions
of
saint
anne
queen
blanche
has
put
beneath
the
figure
a
great
shield
blazoned
with
the
golden
lilies
on
an
azure
ground
with
singular
insistence
on
this
motive
saint
anne
has
at
either
hand
a
royal
court
of
her
own
marked
as
her
own
by
containing
only
figures
from
the
old
testament
standing
next
on
her
right
is
solomon
her
prime
minister
bringing
wisdom
in
worldly
counsel
and
trampling
on
human
folly
beyond
wisdom
stands
law
figured
by
aaron
with
the
book
trampling
on
the
lawless
pharaoh
opposite
them
on
saint
anne
left
is
david
the
energy
of
state
trampling
on
a
saul

suspicions
of
a
saul
de
dreux
while
last
melchisedec
who
is
faith
tramples
on
a
disobedient
nebuchadnezzar
mauclerc
how
can
we
the
common
people
help
seeing
all
this
and
much
more
when
we
know
that
pierre
de
dreux
has
been
for
years
in
constant
strife
with
the
crown
and
the
church
he
is
very
valiant
and
hearted
so
say
the
chroniclers
priests
though
they
are
very
skilful
and
experienced
in
war
whether
by
land
or
sea
very
adroit
with
more
sense
than
any
other
great
lord
in
france
but
restless
factious
and
regardless
of
his
word
brave
and
bold
as
the
day
full
of
courtesy
and
largesse
but
very
hard
on
the
clergy
a
good
christian
but
a
bad
churchman
certainly
the
first
man
of
his
time
says
michelet
i
have
never
found
any
that
sought
to
do
me
more
ill
than
he
says
blanche
and
joinville
gives
her
very
words
indeed
this
year
she
has
summoned
our
own
bishop
of
chartres
among
others
to
paris
in
a
court
of
peers
where
pierre
has
been
found
guilty
of
treason
and
deposed
war
still
continues
but
pierre
must
make
submission
blanche
has
beaten
him
in
politics
and
in
the
field
let
us
look
round
and
see
how
he
fares
in
theology
and
art
there
is
his
rose
so
beautiful
that
blanche
may
well
think
it
seeks
to
do
hers
ill
as
colour
judge
for
yourselves
whether
it
holds
its
own
against
the
flaming
of
the
opposite
wall
as
subject
it
asserts
flat
defiance
of
the
monarchy
of
queen
blanche
in
the
central
circle
christ
as
king
is
seated
on
a
royal
throne
both
arms
raised
one
holding
the
golden
cup
of
eternal
priesthood
the
other
blessing
the
world
two
great
flambeaux
burn
beside
him
the
four
apocalyptic
figures
surround
and
worship
him
and
in
the
concentric
circles
round
the
central
medallion
are
the
angels
and
the
kings
in
a
blaze
of
colour
symbolizing
the
new
jerusalem
all
the
force
of
the
apocalypse
is
there
and
so
is
some
of
the
weakness
of
theology
for
in
the
five
great
windows
below
pierre
shows
his
training
in
the
schools
four
of
these
windows
represent
what
is
called
for
want
of
a
better
name
the
new
alliance
the
dependence
of
the
new
testament
on
the
old
but
pierre
choice
in
symbols
was
as
masculine
as
that
of
blanche
was
feminine
in
each
of
the
four
windows
a
gigantic
evangelist
strides
the
shoulders
of
a
colossal
prophet
saint
john
rides
on
ezekiel
saint
mark
bestrides
daniel
saint
matthew
is
on
the
shoulders
of
isaiah
saint
luke
is
carried
by
jeremiah
the
effect
verges
on
the
grotesque
the
balance
of
christ
church
seems
uncertain
the
evangelists
clutch
the
prophets
by
the
hair
and
while
the
synagogue
stands
firm
the
church
looks
small
feeble
and
vacillating
the
new
dispensation
has
not
the
air
of
mastery
either
physical
or
intellectual
the
old
gives
it
all
the
support
it
has
and
in
the
absence
of
saint
paul
both
old
and
new
seem
little
concerned
with
the
sympathies
of
frenchmen
the
synagogue
is
stronger
than
the
church
but
even
the
church
is
jew
that
pierre
could
ever
have
meant
this
is
not
to
be
dreamed
but
when
the
true
scholar
gets
thoroughly
to
work
his
logic
is
remorseless
his
art
is
implacable
and
his
sense
of
humour
is
blighted
in
the
rose
above
pierre
had
asserted
the
exclusive
authority
of
christ
in
the
new
jerusalem
and
his
scheme
required
him
to
show
how
the
church
rested
on
the
evangelists
below
who
in
their
turn
had
no
visible
support
except
what
the
prophets
gave
them
yet
the
artist
may
have
had
a
reason
for
weakening
the
evangelists
because
there
remained
the
virgin
one
dares
no
more
than
hint
at
a
motive
so
disrespectful
to
the
evangelists
but
it
is
certainly
true
that
in
the
central
window
immediately
beneath
the
christ
and
his
chief
support
with
the
four
staggering
evangelists
and
prophets
on
either
hand
the
virgin
stands
and
betrays
no
sign
of
weakness
the
compliment
is
singularly
masculine
a
kind
of
flattery
that
might
have
softened
the
anger
of
blanche
herself
if
the
virgin
had
been
her
own
but
the
virgin
of
dreux
is
not
the
virgin
of
france
no
doubt
she
still
wears
her
royal
crown
and
her
head
is
circled
with
the
halo
her
right
hand
still
holds
the
flowered
sceptre
and
her
left
the
infant
christ
but
she
stands
and
christ
is
king
note
too
that
she
stands
directly
opposite
to
her
mother
saint
anne
in
the
rose
of
france
so
as
to
place
her
one
stage
lower
than
the
virgin
of
france
in
the
hierarchy
she
is
the
saint
anne
of
france
and
shows
it
she
is
no
longer
says
the
official
monograph
that
majestic
queen
who
was
seated
on
a
throne
with
her
feet
on
the
stool
of
honour
the
personages
have
become
less
imposing
and
the
heads
show
the
decadence
she
is
the
virgin
of
theology
she
has
her
rights
and
no
more
but
she
is
not
the
virgin
of
chartres
she
too
stands
on
an
altar
or
pedestal
on
which
hangs
a
shield
bearing
the
ermines
an
exact
counterpart
of
the
royal
shield
beneath
saint
anne
in
this
excessive
display
of
armorial
bearings
for
the
two
roses
above
are
crowded
with
them
one
likes
to
think
that
these
great
princes
had
in
their
minds
not
so
much
the
thought
of
their
own
importance
which
is
a
modern
sort
of
religion
as
the
thought
of
their
devotion
to
mary
the
assertion
of
power
and
attachment
by
one
is
met
by
the
assertion
of
equal
devotion
by
the
other
and
while
both
loudly
proclaim
their
homage
to
the
virgin
each
glares
defiance
across
the
church
pierre
meant
the
queen
of
heaven
to
know
that
in
case
of
need
her
left
hand
was
as
good
as
her
right
and
truer
that
the
ermines
were
as
well
able
to
defend
her
as
the
lilies
and
that
brittany
would
fight
her
battles
as
bravely
as
france
whether
his
meaning
carried
with
it
more
devotion
to
the
virgin
or
more
defiance
to
france
depends
a
little
on
the
date
of
the
windows
but
as
a
mere
point
of
history
every
one
must
allow
that
pierre
promise
of
allegiance
was
kept
more
faithfully
by
brittany
than
that
of
blanche
and
saint
louis
has
been
kept
by
france
the
date
seems
to
be
fixed
by
the
windows
themselves
beneath
the
prophets
kneel
pierre
and
his
wife
alix
while
their
two
children
yolande
and
jean
stand
alix
died
in
jean
was
born
in
yolande
was
affianced
in
marriage
in
while
a
child
and
given
to
queen
blanche
to
be
brought
up
as
the
future
wife
of
her
younger
son
john
then
in
his
eighth
year
when
john
died
yolande
was
contracted
to
thibaut
of
champagne
in
and
blanche
is
said
to
have
written
to
thibaut
in
consequence
sire
thibauld
of
champagne
i
have
heard
that
you
have
covenanted
and
promised
to
take
to
wife
the
daughter
of
count
perron
of
brittany
wherefore
i
charge
you
if
you
do
not
wish
to
lose
whatever
you
possess
in
the
kingdom
of
france
not
to
do
it
if
you
hold
dear
or
love
aught
in
the
said
kingdom
do
it
not
whether
blanche
wrote
in
these
words
or
not
she
certainly
prevented
the
marriage
and
yolande
remained
single
until
when
she
married
the
comte
de
la
marche
who
was
by
the
way
almost
as
bitter
an
enemy
of
blanche
as
pierre
had
been
but
by
that
time
both
blanche
and
pierre
had
ceased
to
be
regents
yolande
figure
in
the
window
is
that
of
a
girl
perhaps
twelve
or
fourteen
years
old
jean
is
younger
certainly
not
more
than
eight
or
ten
years
of
age
and
the
appearance
of
the
two
children
shows
that
the
window
itself
should
date
between
and
the
year
when
pierre
de
dreux
was
condemned
because
he
had
renounced
his
homage
to
king
louis
declared
war
on
him
and
invited
the
king
of
england
into
france
as
already
told
philippe
hurepel
de
boulogne
the
comte
de
la
marche
enguerrand
de
couci
nearly
all
the
great
nobles
had
been
leagued
with
pierre
de
dreux
since
regency
began
in
that
these
transept
windows
harmonize
at
all
is
due
to
the
virgin
not
to
the
donors
at
the
time
they
were
designed
supposing
it
to
be
during
blanche
regency
the
passions
of
these
donors
brought
france
to
momentary
ruin
and
the
virgin
in
blanche
rose
de
france
as
she
looked
across
the
church
could
not
see
a
single
friend
of
blanche
what
is
more
curious
she
saw
enemies
in
plenty
and
in
full
readiness
for
battle
we
have
seen
in
the
centre
of
the
small
rose
in
the
north
transept
philippe
hurepel
still
waiting
her
orders
across
the
nave
in
another
small
rose
of
the
south
transept
sits
pierre
de
dreux
on
his
horse
the
upper
windows
on
the
side
walls
of
the
choir
are
very
interesting
but
impossible
to
see
even
with
the
best
glasses
from
the
floor
of
the
church
their
sequence
and
dates
have
already
been
discussed
but
their
feeling
is
shown
by
the
character
of
the
virgin
who
in
french
territory
next
the
north
transept
is
still
the
virgin
of
france
but
in
territory
next
the
rose
de
dreux
becomes
again
the
virgin
of
dreux
who
is
absorbed
in
the
child
not
the
child
absorbed
in
her
and
accordingly
the
window
shows
the
chequers
and
ermines
the
figures
like
the
stone
figures
outside
are
the
earliest
of
french
art
before
any
school
of
painting
fairly
existed
among
them
one
can
see
no
friend
of
blanche
indeed
outside
of
her
own
immediate
family
and
the
church
blanche
had
no
friend
of
much
importance
except
the
famous
thibaut
of
champagne
the
single
member
of
the
royal
family
who
took
her
side
and
suffered
for
her
sake
and
who
as
far
as
books
tell
has
no
window
or
memorial
here
one
might
suppose
that
thibaut
who
loved
both
blanche
and
the
virgin
would
have
claimed
a
place
and
perhaps
he
did
but
one
seeks
him
in
vain
if
blanche
had
friends
here
they
are
gone
pierre
de
dreux
lance
in
hand
openly
defies
her
and
it
was
not
on
her
philippe
hurepel
that
she
could
depend
for
defence
this
is
the
court
pageant
of
the
virgin
that
shows
itself
to
the
people
who
are
kneeling
at
high
mass
we
the
public
whoever
we
are
chartrain
breton
norman
angevin
frenchman
percherain
or
what
not
know
our
local
politics
as
intimately
as
our
lords
do
or
even
better
for
our
imaginations
are
active
and
we
do
not
love
blanche
of
castile
we
know
how
to
read
the
passions
that
fill
the
church
from
the
north
transept
blanche
flames
out
on
us
in
splendid
reds
and
flings
her
spanish
castles
in
our
face
from
the
south
transept
pierre
retorts
with
a
brutal
energy
which
shows
itself
in
the
prophets
who
serve
as
and
in
the
evangelists
who
serve
as
knights
mounted
warriors
of
faith
whose
great
eyes
follow
us
across
the
church
and
defy
saint
anne
and
her
french
shield
opposite
pierre
was
not
effeminate
blanche
was
fairly
masculine
between
them
as
a
matter
of
sex
we
can
see
little
to
choose
and
in
any
case
it
is
a
family
quarrel
they
are
all
cousins
they
are
all
equals
on
earth
and
none
means
to
submit
to
any
superior
except
the
virgin
and
her
son
in
heaven
the
virgin
is
not
afraid
she
has
seen
many
troubles
worse
than
this
she
knows
how
to
manage
perverse
children
and
if
necessary
she
will
shut
them
up
in
a
darker
room
than
ever
their
mothers
kept
open
for
them
in
this
world
one
has
only
to
look
at
the
virgin
to
see
there
she
is
of
course
looking
down
on
us
from
the
great
window
above
the
high
altar
where
we
never
forget
her
presence
is
there
a
thought
of
disturbance
there
around
the
curve
of
the
choir
are
seven
great
windows
without
roses
filling
the
whole
semicircle
and
the
whole
vault
feet
high
and
meant
to
dominate
the
nave
as
far
as
the
western
portal
so
that
we
may
never
forget
how
mary
fills
her
church
without
being
disturbed
by
quarrels
and
may
understand
why
saint
ferdinand
and
saint
louis
creep
out
of
our
sight
close
by
the
virgin
side
far
up
above
brawls
and
why
france
and
brittany
hide
their
ugly
or
their
splendid
passions
at
the
ends
of
the
transepts
out
of
sight
of
the
high
altar
where
mary
is
to
sit
in
state
as
queen
with
the
young
king
on
her
lap
in
an
instant
she
will
come
but
we
have
a
moment
still
to
look
about
at
the
last
great
decoration
of
her
palace
and
see
how
the
artists
have
arranged
it
since
the
building
of
sancta
sofia
no
artist
has
had
such
a
chance
no
doubt
rheims
and
amiens
and
bourges
and
beauvais
which
are
now
building
may
be
even
finer
but
none
of
them
is
yet
finished
and
all
must
take
their
ideas
from
here
one
would
like
before
looking
at
it
to
think
over
the
problem
as
though
it
were
new
and
so
choose
the
scheme
that
would
suit
us
best
if
the
decoration
were
to
be
done
for
the
first
time
the
architecture
is
fixed
we
have
to
do
only
with
the
colour
of
this
mass
of
seven
huge
windows
feet
high
in
the
clerestory
round
the
curve
of
the
choir
which
close
the
vista
of
the
church
as
viewed
from
the
entrance
this
vista
is
about
three
hundred
and
thirty
feet
long
the
windows
rise
above
a
hundred
feet
how
ought
this
vast
space
to
be
filled
should
the
perpendicular
upward
leap
of
the
architecture
be
followed
and
accented
by
a
perpendicular
leap
of
colour
the
decorators
of
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
seem
to
have
thought
so
and
made
perpendicular
architectural
drawings
in
yellow
that
simulated
gold
and
lines
that
ran
with
the
general
lines
of
the
building
many
windows
seem
to
be
made
up
of
florid
gothic
details
rising
in
stages
to
the
vault
no
doubt
critics
complained
and
still
complain
that
the
monotony
of
this
scheme
and
its
cheapness
of
intelligence
were
objections
but
at
least
the
effect
was
light
decorative
and
safe
the
artist
could
not
go
far
wrong
and
was
still
at
liberty
to
do
beautiful
work
as
can
be
seen
in
any
number
of
churches
scattered
broadcast
over
europe
and
swarming
in
paris
and
france
on
the
other
hand
might
not
the
artist
disregard
the
architecture
and
fill
the
space
with
a
climax
of
colour
could
he
not
unite
the
roses
of
france
and
dreux
above
the
high
altar
in
an
overpowering
outburst
of
purples
and
reds
the
seventeenth
century
might
have
preferred
to
mass
clouds
and
colours
and
michael
angelo
in
the
sixteenth
might
have
known
how
to
do
it
what
we
want
is
not
the
feeling
of
the
artist
so
much
as
the
feeling
of
chartres
what
shall
it
be
the
jewelled
brilliancy
of
the
western
windows
or
the
fierce
of
pierre
mauclerc
or
the
royal
splendour
of
queen
blanche
or
the
feminine
grace
and
decorative
refinement
of
the
charlemagne
and
santiago
windows
in
the
apse
never
again
in
art
was
so
splendid
a
problem
offered
either
before
or
since
for
the
artist
of
chartres
solved
it
as
he
did
the
whole
matter
of
fenestration
and
later
artists
could
only
offer
variations
on
his
work
you
will
see
them
at
bourges
and
tours
and
in
scores
of
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
century
churches
and
windows
and
perhaps
in
some
of
the
twentieth
century
all
of
them
interesting
and
some
of
them
beautiful
and
far
be
it
from
us
mean
and
ignorant
pilgrims
of
art
to
condemn
any
intelligent
effort
to
vary
or
improve
the
effect
but
we
have
set
out
to
seek
the
feeling
and
while
we
think
of
art
in
relation
to
ourselves
the
sermon
of
chartres
from
beginning
to
end
teaches
and
preaches
and
insists
and
reiterates
and
hammers
into
our
torpid
minds
the
moral
that
the
art
of
the
virgin
was
not
that
of
her
artists
but
her
own
we
inevitably
think
of
our
tastes
they
thought
instinctively
of
hers
in
the
transepts
queen
blanche
and
duke
perron
in
legal
possession
of
their
territory
showed
that
they
were
thinking
of
each
other
as
well
as
of
the
virgin
and
claimed
loudly
that
they
ought
each
to
be
first
in
the
virgin
favour
and
they
stand
there
in
place
as
the
thirteenth
century
felt
them
subject
to
their
fealty
to
mary
the
transepts
belonged
to
them
and
if
blanche
did
not
like
pierre
assert
herself
and
her
son
on
the
virgin
window
perhaps
she
thought
the
virgin
would
resent
pierre
boldness
the
more
by
contrast
with
her
own
good
taste
so
far
as
is
known
nowhere
does
blanche
appear
in
person
at
chartres
she
felt
herself
too
near
the
virgin
to
obtrude
a
useless
image
or
she
was
too
deeply
religious
to
ask
anything
for
herself
a
queen
who
was
to
have
two
children
sainted
to
intercede
for
her
at
mary
throne
stood
in
a
solitude
almost
as
unique
as
that
of
mary
and
might
ignore
the
raw
brutalities
of
a
but
neither
she
nor
pierre
has
carried
the
quarrel
into
mary
presence
nor
has
the
virgin
condescended
even
to
seem
conscious
of
their
temper
this
is
the
theme
of
the
artist
the
purity
the
beauty
the
grace
and
the
infinite
loftiness
of
mary
nature
among
the
things
of
earth
and
above
the
clamour
of
kings
therefore
when
we
and
the
crushed
crowd
of
kneeling
worshippers
around
us
lift
our
eyes
at
last
after
the
miracle
of
the
mass
we
see
far
above
the
high
altar
high
over
all
the
agitation
of
prayer
the
passion
of
politics
the
anguish
of
suffering
the
terrors
of
sin
only
the
figure
of
the
virgin
in
majesty
looking
down
on
her
people
crowned
throned
glorified
with
the
infant
christ
on
her
knees
she
does
not
assert
herself
probably
she
intends
to
be
felt
rather
than
feared
compared
with
the
greek
virgin
as
you
see
her
for
example
at
torcello
the
chartres
virgin
is
retiring
and
hardly
important
enough
for
the
place
she
is
not
exaggerated
either
in
scale
drawing
or
colour
she
shows
not
a
sign
of
not
an
effort
for
brilliancy
not
a
trace
of
stage
effect
hardly
even
a
thought
of
herself
except
that
she
is
at
home
among
her
own
people
where
she
is
loved
and
known
as
well
as
she
knows
them
the
seven
great
windows
are
one
composition
and
it
is
plain
that
the
artist
had
he
been
ordered
to
make
an
exhibition
of
power
could
have
overwhelmed
us
with
a
storm
of
purple
red
yellows
or
given
us
a
virgin
of
passion
who
would
have
torn
the
vault
asunder
his
ability
is
never
in
doubt
and
if
he
has
kept
true
to
the
spirit
of
the
western
portal
and
the
it
is
because
the
virgin
of
chartres
was
the
virgin
of
grace
and
ordered
him
to
paint
her
so
one
shudders
to
think
how
a
single
false
note
a
suggestion
of
meanness
in
this
climax
of
line
and
colour
would
bring
the
whole
fabric
down
in
ruins
on
the
meanness
of
the
choir
below
and
one
notes
almost
bashfully
the
expedients
of
the
artists
to
quiet
their
effects
so
the
lines
of
the
seven
windows
are
built
up
to
avoid
the
horizontal
and
yet
not
exaggerate
the
vertical
the
architect
counts
here
for
more
than
the
colourist
but
the
colour
when
you
study
it
suggests
the
same
restraint
three
great
windows
on
the
virgin
right
balanced
by
three
more
on
her
left
show
the
prophets
and
precursors
of
her
son
all
architecturally
support
and
exalt
the
virgin
in
her
celestial
atmosphere
of
blue
shot
with
red
calm
in
the
certainty
of
heaven
any
one
who
is
prematurely
curious
to
see
the
difference
in
treatment
between
different
centuries
should
go
down
to
the
church
of
saint
pierre
in
the
lower
town
and
study
there
the
methods
of
the
renaissance
then
we
can
come
back
to
study
again
the
ways
of
the
thirteenth
century
the
virgin
will
wait
she
will
not
be
angry
she
knows
her
power
we
all
come
back
to
her
in
the
end
or
the
renaissance
if
one
prefers
can
wait
equally
well
while
one
kneels
with
the
thirteenth
century
and
feels
the
little
one
still
can
feel
of
what
it
felt
technically
these
apsidal
windows
have
not
received
much
notice
the
books
rarely
speak
of
them
travellers
seldom
look
at
them
and
their
height
is
such
that
even
with
the
best
glass
the
quality
of
the
work
is
beyond
our
power
to
judge
we
see
and
the
artists
meant
that
we
should
see
only
the
great
lines
the
colour
and
the
virgin
the
mass
of
suppliants
before
the
choir
look
up
to
the
light
clear
blues
and
reds
of
this
great
space
and
feel
there
the
celestial
peace
and
beauty
of
mary
nature
and
abode
there
is
heaven
and
mary
looks
down
from
it
into
her
church
where
she
sees
us
on
our
knees
and
knows
each
one
of
us
by
name
there
she
actually
is
not
in
symbol
or
in
fancy
but
in
person
descending
on
her
errands
of
mercy
and
listening
to
each
one
of
us
as
her
miracles
prove
or
satisfying
our
prayers
merely
by
her
presence
which
calms
our
excitement
as
that
of
a
mother
calms
her
child
she
is
there
as
queen
not
merely
as
intercessor
and
her
power
is
such
that
to
her
the
difference
between
us
earthly
beings
is
nothing
her
quiet
masculine
strength
enchants
us
most
pierre
mauclerc
and
philippe
hurepel
and
their
are
afraid
of
her
and
the
bishop
himself
is
never
quite
at
his
ease
in
her
presence
but
to
peasants
and
beggars
and
people
in
trouble
this
sense
of
her
power
and
calm
is
better
than
active
sympathy
people
who
suffer
beyond
the
formulas
of
expression
who
are
crushed
into
silence
and
beyond
pain
want
no
display
of
emotion
no
bleeding
heart
no
weeping
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
no
hysterics
no
phrases
they
want
to
see
god
and
to
know
that
he
is
watching
over
his
own
how
many
women
are
there
in
this
mass
of
thirteenth
century
suppliants
who
have
lost
children
probably
nearly
all
for
the
death
rate
is
very
high
in
the
conditions
of
medieval
life
there
are
thousands
of
such
women
here
for
it
is
precisely
this
class
who
come
most
and
probably
every
one
of
them
has
looked
up
to
mary
in
her
great
window
and
has
felt
actual
certainty
as
though
she
saw
with
her
own
eyes
there
in
heaven
while
she
looked
her
own
lost
baby
playing
with
the
at
the
virgin
knee
as
much
at
home
as
the
saints
and
much
more
at
home
than
the
kings
before
rising
from
her
knees
every
one
of
these
women
will
have
bent
down
and
kissed
the
stone
pavement
in
gratitude
for
mercy
the
earth
she
says
is
a
sorry
place
and
the
best
of
it
is
bad
enough
no
doubt
even
for
queen
blanche
and
the
duchess
alix
who
has
had
to
leave
her
children
here
alone
but
there
above
is
mary
in
heaven
who
sees
and
hears
me
as
i
see
her
and
who
keeps
my
little
boy
till
i
come
so
i
can
wait
with
patience
more
or
less
saints
and
prophets
and
martyrs
are
all
very
well
and
christ
is
very
sublime
and
just
but
mary
knows
it
was
very
childlike
very
foolish
very
beautiful
and
very
true
art
at
least
so
true
that
everything
else
shades
off
into
vulgarity
as
you
see
the
persephone
of
a
syracusan
coin
shade
off
into
the
vulgarity
of
a
roman
emperor
as
though
the
heaven
that
lies
about
us
in
our
infancy
too
quickly
takes
colours
that
are
not
so
much
sober
as
sordid
and
would
be
welcome
if
no
worse
than
that
vulgarity
too
has
feeling
and
its
expression
in
art
has
truth
and
even
pathos
but
we
shall
have
time
enough
in
our
lives
for
that
and
all
the
more
because
when
we
rise
from
our
knees
now
we
have
finished
our
pilgrimage
we
have
done
with
chartres
for
seven
hundred
years
chartres
has
seen
pilgrims
coming
and
going
more
or
less
like
us
and
will
perhaps
see
them
for
another
seven
hundred
years
but
we
shall
see
it
no
more
and
can
safely
leave
the
virgin
in
her
majesty
with
her
three
great
prophets
on
either
hand
as
calm
and
confident
in
their
own
strength
and
in
god
providence
as
they
were
when
saint
louis
was
born
but
looking
down
from
a
deserted
heaven
into
an
empty
church

may
wander
far

over

and
seldom
feel
lost
all
later
gothic
art
comes
naturally
and
no

disturbs
the

are
seldom

never
quite

commonly
they
feel

twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
studied
in
the
pure
light
of

economy
are
insane
the
scientific

is
atrophied
and
suffers
under
inherited
cerebral
weakness
when
it
comes
in
contact
with
the
eternal
woman
astarte
isis
demeter
aphrodite
and
the
last
and
greatest
deity
of
all
the
virgin
very
rarely
one
lingers
with
a
mild
sympathy
such
as
suits
the
patient
student
of
human
error
willing
to
be
interested
in
what
he
can
not
understand
still
more
rarely
owing
to
some
revival
of
archaic
instincts
he
rediscovers
the
woman
this
is
perhaps
the
mark
of
the
artist
alone
and
his
solitary
privilege
the
rest
of
us
can
not
feel
we
can
only
study
the
proper
study
of
mankind
is
woman
and
by
common
agreement
since
the
time
of
adam
it
is
the
most
complex
and
arduous
the
study
of
our
lady
as
shown
by
the
art
of
chartres
leads
directly
back
to
eve
and
lays
bare
the
whole
subject
of
sex
if
it
were
worth
while
to
argue
a
paradox
one
might
maintain
that
nature
regards
the
female
as
the
essential
the
male
as
the
superfluity
of
her
world
perhaps
the
best
for
study
of
the
virgin
would
be
a
practical
acquaintance
with
bees
and
especially
with
queen
bees
precisely
where
the
french
man
may
come
in
on
the
genealogical
tree
of
parthenogenesis
one
hesitates
to
say
but
certain
it
is
that
the
french
woman
from
very
early
times
has
shown
qualities
peculiar
to
herself
and
that
the
french
woman
of
the
middle
ages
was
a
masculine
character
almost
any
book
which
deals
with
the
social
side
of
the
twelfth
century
has
something
to
say
on
this
subject
like
the
following
page
from
volume
published
in
on
the
social
state
of
france
during
the
crusades
a
trait
peculiar
to
this
epoch
is
the
close
resemblance
between
the
manners
of
men
and
women
the
rule
that
such
and
such
feelings
or
acts
are
permitted
to
one
sex
and
forbidden
to
the
other
was
not
fairly
settled
men
had
the
right
to
dissolve
in
tears
and
women
that
of
talking
without
prudery
if
we
look
at
their
intellectual
level
the
women
appear
distinctly
superior
they
are
more
serious
more
subtle
with
them
we
do
not
seem
dealing
with
the
rude
state
of
civilization
that
their
husbands
belong
to
as
a
rule
the
women
seem
to
have
the
habit
of
weighing
their
acts
of
not
yielding
to
momentary
impressions
while
the
sense
of
christianity
is
more
developed
in
them
than
in
their
husbands
on
the
other
hand
they
show
more
perfidy
and
art
in
crime
one
might
doubtless
prove
by
a
series
of
examples
that
the
maternal
influence
when
it
predominated
in
the
education
of
a
son
gave
him
a
marked
superiority
over
his
contemporaries
richard
the
crowned
poet
artist
the
king
whose
noble
manners
and
refined
mind
in
spite
of
his
cruelty
exercised
so
strong
an
impression
on
his
age
was
formed
by
that
brilliant
eleanor
of
guienne
who
in
her
struggle
with
her
husband
retained
her
sons
as
much
as
possible
within
her
sphere
of
influence
in
order
to
make
party
chiefs
of
them
our
great
saint
louis
as
all
know
was
brought
up
exclusively
by
blanche
of
castile
and
joinville
the
charming
writer
so
worthy
of
saint
louis
friendship
and
apparently
so
superior
to
his
surroundings
was
also
the
pupil
of
a
widowed
and
regent
mother
the
superiority
of
the
woman
was
not
a
fancy
but
a
fact
business
was
to
fight
or
hunt
or
feast
or
make
love
the
man
was
also
the
travelling
partner
in
commerce
commonly
absent
from
home
for
months
together
while
the
woman
carried
on
the
business
the
woman
ruled
the
household
and
the
workshop
cared
for
the
economy
supplied
the
intelligence
and
dictated
the
taste
her
ascendancy
was
secured
by
her
alliance
with
the
church
into
which
she
sent
her
most
intelligent
children
and
a
priest
or
clerk
for
the
most
part
counted
socially
as
a
woman
both
physically
and
mentally
the
woman
was
robust
as
the
men
often
complained
and
she
did
not
greatly
resent
being
treated
as
a
man
sometimes
the
husband
beat
her
dragged
her
about
by
the
hair
locked
her
up
in
the
house
but
he
was
quite
conscious
that
she
always
got
even
with
him
in
the
end
as
a
matter
of
fact
probably
she
got
more
than
even
on
this
point
history
legend
poetry
romance
and
especially
the
popular
fabliaux
invented
to
amuse
the
gross
tastes
of
the
coarser
class
are
all
agreed
and
one
could
give
scores
of
volumes
illustrating
it
the
greatest
men
illustrate
it
best
as
one
might
show
almost
at
hazard
the
greatest
men
of
the
eleventh
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
were
william
the
norman
his
great
grandson
henry
ii
plantagenet
saint
louis
of
france
and
if
a
fourth
be
needed
richard
notoriously
all
these
men
had
as
much
difficulty
as
louis
xiv
himself
with
the
women
of
their
family
tradition
exaggerates
everything
it
touches
but
shows
at
the
same
time
what
is
passing
in
the
minds
of
the
society
which
tradites
in
normandy
the
people
of
caen
have
kept
a
tradition
told
elsewhere
in
other
forms
that
one
day
duke
william
the
conqueror
exasperated
by
having
his
bastardy
constantly
thrown
in
his
face
by
the
duchess
matilda
dragged
her
by
the
hair
tied
to
his
tail
as
far
as
the
suburb
of
vaucelles
and
this
legend
accounts
for
the
splendour
of
the
because
william
the
common
people
believed
afterwards
regretted
the
impropriety
and
atoned
for
it
by
giving
her
money
to
build
the
abbey
the
story
betrays
the
man
weakness
the
stands
in
the
same
relation
to
the
that
matilda
took
towards
william
inferiority
there
was
none
on
the
contrary
the
woman
was
socially
the
superior
and
william
was
probably
more
afraid
of
her
than
she
of
him
if
freeman
is
right
in
insisting
that
he
married
her
in
spite
of
her
having
a
husband
living
and
certainly
two
children
if
william
was
the
strongest
man
in
the
eleventh
century
his
grandson
henry
ii
of
england
was
the
strongest
man
of
the
twelfth
but
the
history
of
the
time
resounds
with
the
noise
of
his
battles
with
queen
eleanor
whom
he
at
last
held
in
prison
for
fourteen
years
prisoner
as
she
was
she
broke
him
down
in
the
end
one
is
tempted
to
suspect
that
had
her
husband
and
children
been
guided
by
her
and
by
her
policy
as
peacemaker
for
the
good
of
guienne
most
of
the
disasters
of
england
and
france
might
have
been
postponed
for
the
time
but
we
can
never
know
the
truth
for
monks
and
historians
abhor
emancipated
women
with
good
reason
since
such
women
are
apt
to
abhor
them
and
the
quarrel
can
never
be
pacified
historians
have
commonly
shown
fear
of
women
without
admitting
it
but
the
man
of
the
middle
ages
knew
at
least
why
he
feared
the
woman
and
told
it
openly
not
to
say
brutally
long
after
eleanor
and
blanche
were
dead
chaucer
brought
the
wife
of
bath
on
his
shakespearean
stage
to
explain
the
woman
and
as
usual
he
touched
masculine
frailty
with
caustic
while
seeming
to
laugh
at
woman
and
man
alike
my
liege
lady
generally
quoth
he
women
desiren
to
have
soverainetee
the
point
was
that
the
wife
of
bath
like
queen
blanche
and
queen
eleanor
not
only
wanted
sovereignty
but
won
and
held
it
that
saint
louis
even
when
a
grown
man
and
king
stood
in
awe
of
his
mother
blanche
of
castile
was
not
only
notorious
but
seemed
to
be
thought
natural
joinville
recorded
it
not
so
much
to
mark
the
king
weakness
as
the
woman
strength
for
his
queen
margaret
of
provence
showed
the
courage
which
the
king
had
not
blanche
and
margaret
were
exceedingly
jealous
of
each
other
one
day
said
joinville
queen
blanche
went
to
the
queen
margaret
chamber
where
her
son
louis
ix
had
gone
before
to
comfort
her
for
she
was
in
great
danger
of
death
from
a
bad
delivery
and
he
hid
himself
behind
the
queen
margaret
to
avoid
being
seen
but
his
mother
perceived
him
and
taking
him
by
the
hand
said
along
you
will
do
no
good
here
and
put
him
out
of
the
chamber
queen
margaret
observing
this
and
that
she
was
to
be
separated
from
her
husband
cried
aloud
will
you
not
allow
me
to
see
my
lord
either
living
or
dying
according
to
joinville
king
louis
always
hid
himself
when
in
his
wife
chamber
he
heard
his
mother
coming
the
great
period
of
gothic
architecture
begins
with
the
coming
of
eleanor
and
ends
with
the
passing
of
blanche
eleanor
long
life
was
full
of
energy
and
passion
of
which
next
to
nothing
is
known
the
woman
was
always
too
slippery
for
monks
or
soldiers
to
grasp
eleanor
came
to
paris
a
queen
of
fifteen
years
old
in
bringing
poitiers
and
guienne
as
the
greatest
dowry
ever
offered
to
the
french
crown
she
brought
also
the
tastes
and
manners
of
the
south
little
in
harmony
with
the
tastes
and
manners
of
saint
bernard
whose
authority
at
court
rivalled
her
own
the
abbe
suger
supported
her
but
the
king
leaned
toward
the
abbe
bernard
what
this
puritan
reaction
meant
is
a
matter
to
be
studied
by
itself
if
one
can
find
a
cloister
to
study
in
but
it
bore
the
mark
of
most
puritan
reactions
in
its
hostility
to
women
as
long
as
the
woman
remained
docile
she
ruled
through
the
church
but
the
man
feared
her
and
was
jealous
of
her
and
she
of
him
bernard
specially
adored
the
virgin
because
she
was
an
example
of
docile
obedience
to
the
trinity
who
atoned
for
the
indocility
of
eve
but
eve
herself
remained
the
instrument
of
satan
and
french
society
as
a
whole
showed
a
taste
for
eves
genealogical
chart
showing
the
relationships
among
the
three
queens
eleanor
could
hardly
be
called
docile
whatever
else
she
loved
she
certainly
loved
rule
she
shared
this
passion
to
the
full
with
her
only
great
successor
and
rival
on
the
english
throne
queen
elizabeth
and
she
happened
to
become
queen
of
france
at
the
moment
when
society
was
turning
from
worship
of
its
military
ideal
saint
michael
to
worship
of
its
social
ideal
the
virgin
according
to
the
monk
orderic
men
had
begun
to
throw
aside
their
old
military
dress
and
manners
even
before
the
first
crusade
in
the
days
of
william
rufus
and
to
affect
feminine
fashions
in
all
ages
priests
and
monks
have
denounced
the
growing
vices
of
society
with
more
or
less
reason
but
there
seems
to
have
been
a
real
outbreak
of
display
at
about
the
time
of
the
first
crusade
which
set
a
deep
mark
on
every
sort
of
social
expression
even
down
to
the
shoes
of
the
statues
on
the
western
portal
of
chartres
a
debauched
fellow
named
robert
said
orderic
was
the
first
about
the
time
of
william
rufus
who
introduced
the
practice
of
filling
the
long
points
of
the
shoes
with
tow
and
of
turning
them
up
like
a
ram
horn
hence
he
got
the
surname
of
cornard
and
this
absurd
fashion
was
speedily
adopted
by
great
numbers
of
the
nobility
as
a
proud
distinction
and
sign
of
merit
at
this
time
effeminacy
was
the
prevailing
vice
throughout
the
world
they
parted
their
hair
from
the
crown
of
the
head
on
each
side
of
the
forehead
and
their
locks
grew
long
like
women
and
wore
long
shirts
and
tunics
closely
tied
with
points
in
our
days
ancient
customs
are
almost
all
changed
for
new
fashions
our
wanton
youths
are
sunk
in
effeminacy
they
insert
their
toes
in
things
like
serpents
tails
which
present
to
view
the
shape
of
scorpions
sweeping
the
dusty
ground
with
the
prodigious
trains
of
their
robes
and
mantles
they
cover
their
hands
with
gloves
if
you
are
curious
to
follow
these
monkish
criticisms
on
your
ancestors
habits
you
can
read
orderic
at
your
leisure
but
you
want
only
to
carry
in
mind
the
fact
that
the
generation
of
warriors
who
fought
at
hastings
and
captured
jerusalem
were
regarded
by
themselves
as
effeminate
and
plunged
in
luxury
their
locks
are
curled
with
hot
irons
and
instead
of
wearing
caps
they
bind
their
heads
with
fillets
a
knight
seldom
appears
in
public
with
his
head
uncovered
and
properly
shaved
according
to
the
apostolic
precept
the
effeminacy
of
the
first
crusade
took
artistic
shape
in
the
west
portal
of
chartres
and
the
glass
of
and
led
instantly
to
the
puritan
reaction
of
saint
bernard
followed
by
the
gentle
asceticism
of
queen
blanche
and
saint
louis
whether
the
pilgrimages
to
jerusalem
and
contact
with
the
east
were
the
cause
or
only
a
consequence
of
this
revolution
or
whether
it
was
all
one
a
result
of
converting
the
northern
pagans
to
peaceful
habits
and
the
consequent
enrichment
of
northern
europe
is
indifferent
the
fact
and
the
date
are
enough
the
art
is
french
but
the
ideas
may
have
come
from
anywhere
like
the
game
of
chess
which
the
pilgrims
or
crusaders
brought
home
from
syria
in
the
oriental
game
the
king
was
followed
step
by
step
by
a
minister
whose
functions
were
personal
the
crusaders
freed
the
piece
from
control
gave
it
liberty
to
move
up
or
down
or
diagonally
forwards
and
backwards
made
it
the
most
arbitrary
and
formidable
champion
on
the
board
while
the
king
and
the
knight
were
the
most
restricted
in
movement
and
this
piece
they
named
queen
and
called
the
virgin

saw
that

in
elevating

had
made

appear
ridiculous
and
he
tried
to
retaliate
with
a
wit
not

sparkling

too
often
at
his
own
expense

in

perhaps
the

of

it

the
scene
of
the

one
of
the
best

christian
dramaturgy

remarkable
work

have
been

the

that

she

brought

to

evil
state
badly
for
me
it
turned
i
own
but
all
the

is

alone
the
audience
accepted
this
as
natural
and
proper
they
recognized
the
man
as
of
course
stupid
cowardly
and
traitorous
the
men
of
the
baser
sort
revenged
themselves
by
boorishness
that
passed
with
them
for
wit
in
the
taverns
of
arras
but
the
poets
of
the
higher
class
commonly
took
sides
with
the
women
even
chaucer
who
lived
after
the
glamour
had
faded
and
who
satirized
women
to
satiety
told
their
tale
in

legend
of
good
women
with
evident
sympathy
to

also
the

stupid
brutal

even
bluebeard
in

fell
a
victim
to
the
superior
qualities
of
his
last
wife
and
scheherazade
wit
alone
has
preserved
the
memory
of
her
royal
husband
the
tradition
of
society
still
rules
the
french
stage
the
struggle
between
two
women
to
control
one
man
is
the
usual
motive
of
the
french
drama
in
the
nineteenth
century
as
it
was
the
whole
motive
of
partenopeus
of
blois
one
of
the
best
romans
and
joinville
described
it
in
the
middle
of
the
thirteenth
as
the
leading
motive
in
the
court
of
saint
louis
with
queen
blanche
and
queen
margaret
for
players
and
saint
louis
himself
for
pawn
one
has
only
to
look
at
the
common
elzevirian
volume
of
nouvelles
to
see
the
frenchman
as
he
saw
himself
the
story
of
la
comtesse
de
ponthieu
is
the
more
shakespearean
but
la
belle
jehanne
is
the
more
natural
and
lifelike
the
plot
is
the
common
masculine
intrigue
against
the
woman
which
was
used
over
and
over
again
before
shakespeare
appropriated
it
in
much
ado
but
its
french
development
is
rather
in
the
line
of
all
well
the
fair
jeanne
married
to
a
penniless
knight
not
at
all
by
her
choice
but
only
because
he
was
a
favourite
of
her
father
was
a
woman
of
the
true
type
she
broke
the
head
of
the
traitor
and
when
he
with
his
masculine
falseness
caused
her
husband
to
desert
her
she
disguised
herself
as
a
squire
and
followed
sir
robert
to
marseilles
in
search
of
service
in
war
for
the
poor
knight
could
get
no
other
means
of
livelihood
robert
was
the
husband
and
the
wife
in
entering
his
service
as
squire
without
pay
called
herself

much
was
sir
robert
grieved
when
he
came
to
marseilles
and
found
that
there
was
no
talk
of
anything
doing
in
the
country
and
he
said
to
john
what
shall
we
do
you
have
lent
me
your
money
i
thank
you
and
will
repay
you
for
i
will
sell
my
palfrey
and
discharge
the
debt
to
you
sir
said
john
trust
to
me
if
you
please
i
will
tell
you
what
we
will
do
i
have
still
a
hundred
sous
if
you
please
i
will
sell
our
two
horses
and
turn
them
into
money
and
i
am
the
best
baker
you
ever
knew
i
will
make
french
bread
and
i
no
doubt
i
shall
pay
my
expenses
well
and
make
money
john
said
sir
robert
i
agree
wholly
to
do
whatever
you
like
and
the
next
day
john
sold
their
two
horse
for
ten
pounds
and
bought
his
wheat
and
had
it
ground
and
bought
baskets
and
began
to
make
french
bread
so
good
and
so
well
made
that
he
sold
more
of
it
than
the
two
best
bakers
in
the
city
and
made
so
much
within
two
years
that
he
had
a
good
hundred
pound
property
then
he
said
to
his
lord
i
advise
our
hiring
a
very
large
house
and
i
will
buy
wine
and
will
keep
lodgings
for
good
society
john
said
sir
robert
do
what
you
please
for
i
grant
it
and
am
greatly
pleased
with
you
john
hired
a
large
and
fine
house
and
lodged
the
best
people
and
gained
a
great
plenty
and
dressed
his
master
handsomely
and
richly
and
sir
robert
kept
his
palfrey
and
went
out
to
eat
and
drink
with
the
best
people
of
the
city
and
john
sent
them
such
wines
and
food
that
all
his
companions
marvelled
at
it
he
made
so
much
that
within
four
years
he
gained
more
than
three
hundred
pounds
in
money
besides
clothes
etc
well
worth
fifty
the
docile
obedience
of
the
man
to
the
woman
seemed
as
reasonable
to
the
thirteenth
century
as
the
devotion
of
the
woman
to
the
man
not
because
she
loved
him
for
there
was
no
question
of
love
but
because
he
was
her
man
and
she
owned
him
as
though
he
were
child
the
tale
went
on
to
develop
her
character
always
in
the
same
sense
when
she
was
ready
jeanne
broke
up
the
establishment
at
marseilles
brought
her
husband
back
to
hainault
and
made
him
without
knowing
her
object
kill
the
traitor
and
redress
her
wrongs
then
after
seven
years
patient
waiting
she
revealed
herself
and
resumed
her
place
if
you
care
to
see
the
same
type
developed
to
its
highest
capacity
go
to
the
theatre
the
first
time
some
ambitious
actress
attempts
the
part
of
lady
macbeth
shakespeare
realized
the
woman
more
vividly
than
the
poets
ever
did
but
that
is
no
new
thing
to
say
of
shakespeare
the
author
of
la
comtesse
de
ponthieu
made
no
bad
sketch
of
the
character
these
are
fictions
but
the
chronicles
contain
the
names
of
women
by
scores
who
were
the
originals
of
the
sketch
the
society
which
orderic
described
in
normandy
the
generation
of
the
first
crusade
produced
a
great
variety
of
lady
macbeths
in
the
country
of
evreux
about
orderic
says
that
a
worse
than
civil
war
was
waged
between
two
powerful
brothers
and
the
mischief
was
fomented
by
the
spiteful
jealousy
of
their
haughty
wives
the
countess
havise
of
evreux
took
offence
at
some
taunts
uttered
by
isabel
de
conches
wife
of
ralph
the
seigneur
of
conches
some
ten
miles
from
evreux
and
used
all
her
influence
with
her
husband
count
william
and
his
barons
to
make
trouble
both
the
ladies
who
stirred
up
these
fierce
enmities
were
great
talkers
and
spirited
as
well
as
handsome
they
ruled
their
husbands
oppressed
their
vassals
and
inspired
terror
in
various
ways
but
still
their
characters
were
very
different
havise
had
wit
and
eloquence
but
she
was
cruel
and
avaricious
isabel
was
generous
enterprising
and
gay
so
that
she
was
beloved
and
esteemed
by
those
about
her
she
rode
in
knight
armour
when
her
vassals
were
called
to
war
and
showed
as
much
daring
among
and
mounted
knights
as
camilla
more
than
three
hundred
years
afterwards
far
off
in
the
vosges
from
a
village
never
heard
of
appeared
a
common
peasant
of
seventeen
years
old
a
girl
without
birth
education
wealth
or
claim
of
any
sort
to
consideration
who
made
her
way
to
chinon
and
claimed
from
charles
vii
a
commission
to
lead
his
army
against
the
english
neither
the
king
nor
the
court
had
faith
in
her
and
yet
the
commission
was
given
and
the
showed
again
that
the
true
frenchman
had
more
confidence
in
the
woman
than
in
the
man
no
matter
what
the
gossips
might
say
no
one
was
surprised
when
jeanne
did
what
she
promised
or
when
the
men
burned
her
for
doing
it
there
were
jeannes
in
every
village
ridicule
was
powerless
against
them
even
voltaire
became
what
the
french
call
frankly
bete
in
trying
it
eleanor
of
guienne
was
the
greatest
of
all
frenchwomen
her
decision
was
law
whether
in
bordeaux
or
poitiers
in
paris
or
in
palestine
in
london
or
in
normandy
in
the
court
of
louis
vii
or
in
that
of
henry
ii
or
in
her
own
court
of
love
for
fifteen
years
she
was
queen
of
france
for
fifty
she
was
queen
in
england
for
eighty
or
thereabouts
she
was
equivalent
to
queen
over
guienne
no
other
frenchwoman
ever
had
such
rule
unfortunately
as
queen
of
france
she
struck
against
an
authority
greater
than
her
own
that
of
saint
bernard
and
after
combating
it
with
suger
help
from
until
the
monk
at
last
gained
such
mastery
that
eleanor
quitted
the
country
and
suger
died
she
was
not
a
person
to
accept
defeat
she
royally
divorced
her
husband
and
went
back
to
her
own
kingdom
of
guienne
neither
louis
nor
bernard
dared
to
stop
her
or
to
hold
her
territories
from
her
but
they
put
the
best
face
they
could
on
their
defeat
by
proclaiming
her
as
a
person
of
irregular
conduct
the
irregularity
would
not
have
stood
in
their
way
if
they
had
dared
to
stand
in
hers
but
louis
was
much
the
weaker
and
made
himself
weaker
still
by
allowing
her
to
leave
him
for
the
sake
of
henry
of
anjou
a
story
of
a
sort
that
rarely
raised
the
respect
in
which
french
kings
were
held
by
french
society
probably
politics
had
more
to
do
with
the
matter
than
personal
attachments
for
eleanor
was
a
great
ruler
the
equal
of
any
ordinary
king
and
more
powerful
than
most
kings
living
in
if
she
deserted
france
in
order
to
join
the
enemies
of
france
she
had
serious
reasons
besides
love
for
young
henry
of
anjou
but
in
any
case
she
did
as
usual
what
pleased
her
and
forced
louis
to
pronounce
the
divorce
at
a
council
held
at
beaugency
march
on
the
usual
pretext
of
relationship
the
humours
of
the
twelfth
century
were
shakespearean
eleanor
having
obtained
her
divorce
at
beaugency
to
the
deep
regret
of
all
frenchmen
started
at
once
for
poitiers
knowing
how
unsafe
she
was
in
any
territory
but
her
own
beaugency
is
on
the
loire
between
orleans
and
blois
and
eleanor
first
night
was
at
blois
or
should
have
been
but
she
was
told
on
arriving
that
count
thibaut
of
blois
undeterred
by
king
louis
experience
was
making
plans
to
detain
her
with
perfectly
honourable
views
of
marriage
and
as
she
seems
at
least
not
to
have
been
in
love
with
thibaut
she
was
obliged
to
depart
at
once
in
the
night
to
tours
a
night
journey
on
horseback
from
blois
to
tours
in
the
middle
of
march
can
have
been
no
even
in
but
on
arriving
at
tours
in
the
morning
eleanor
found
that
her
lovers
were
still
so
dangerously
near
that
she
set
forward
at
once
on
the
road
to
poitiers
as
she
approached
her
own
territory
she
learned
that
geoffrey
of
anjou
the
younger
brother
of
her
intended
husband
was
waiting
for
her
at
the
border
with
views
of
marriage
as
strictly
honourable
as
those
of
all
the
others
she
was
driven
to
take
another
road
and
at
last
got
safe
to
poitiers
about
no
figure
in
the
middle
ages
man
or
woman
did
so
many
legends
grow
and
with
such
freedom
as
about
eleanor
whose
strength
appealed
to
french
sympathies
and
whose
adventures
appealed
to
their
imagination
they
never
forgave
louis
for
letting
her
go
they
delighted
to
be
told
that
in
palestine
she
had
carried
on
relations
of
the
most
improper
character
now
with
a
saracen
slave
of
great
beauty
now
with
raymond
of
poitiers
her
uncle
the
handsomest
man
of
his
time
now
with
saladin
himself
and
as
all
this
occurred
at
antioch
in
or
they
could
not
explain
why
her
husband
should
have
waited
until
in
order
to
express
his
unwilling
disapproval
but
they
quoted
with
evident
sympathy
a
remark
attributed
to
her
that
she
thought
she
had
married
a
king
and
found
she
had
married
a
monk
to
the
frenchman
eleanor
remained
always
sympathetic
which
is
the
more
significant
because
in
english
tradition
her
character
suffered
a
violent
and
incredible
change
although
english
history
has
lavished
on
eleanor
somewhat
more
than
her
due
share
of
conventional
moral
reproof
considering
that
from
the
moment
she
married
henry
of
anjou
may
she
was
never
charged
with
a
breath
of
scandal
it
atoned
for
her
want
of
wickedness
by
french
standards
in
the
usual
manner
of
historians
by
inventing
traits
which
reflected
the
moral
standards
of
england
tradition
converted
her
into
the
type
of
feminine
jealousy
and
invented
for
her
the
legend
of
the
fair
rosamund
and
the
poison
of
toads
for
us
both
legends
are
true
they
reflected
not
perhaps
the
character
of
eleanor
but
what
the
society
liked
to
see
acted
on
its
theatre
of
life
eleanor
real
nature
in
no
way
concerns
us
the
single
fact
worth
remembering
was
that
she
had
two
daughters
by
louis
vii
as
shown
in
the
table
who
in
due
time
married
mary
in
married
henry
the
great
count
of
champagne
alix
at
the
same
time
became
countess
of
chartres
by
marriage
with
thibaut
who
had
driven
her
mother
from
blois
in
by
his
marital
intentions
henry
and
thibaut
were
brothers
whose
sister
alix
had
married
louis
vii
in
eight
years
after
the
divorce
the
relations
thus
created
were
fantastic
especially
for
queen
eleanor
who
besides
her
two
french
daughters
had
eight
children
as
queen
of
england
her
second
son
richard
born
in
was
affianced
in
to
a
daughter
of
louis
vii
and
alix
a
child
only
six
years
old
who
was
sent
to
england
to
be
brought
up
as
future
queen
this
was
certainly
eleanor
doing
and
equally
certain
was
it
that
the
child
came
to
no
good
in
the
english
court
the
historians
by
exception
have
not
charged
this
crime
to
queen
eleanor
they
charged
it
to
eleanor
husband
who
passed
most
of
his
life
in
crossing
his
wife
political
plans
but
with
politics
we
want
as
little
as
possible
to
do
we
are
concerned
with
the
artistic
and
social
side
of
life
and
have
only
to
notice
the
coincidence
that
while
the
virgin
was
miraculously
using
the
power
of
spiritual
love
to
elevate
and
purify
the
people
eleanor
and
her
daughters
were
using
the
power
of
earthly
love
to
discipline
and
refine
the
courts
side
by
side
with
the
crude
realities
about
them
they
insisted
on
teaching
and
enforcing
an
ideal
that
contradicted
the
realities
and
had
no
value
for
them
or
for
us
except
in
the
contradiction
the
ideals
of
eleanor
and
her
daughter
mary
of
champagne
were
a
form
of
religion
and
if
you
care
to
see
its
evangels
you
had
best
go
directly
to
dante
and
petrarch
or
if
you
like
it
better
to
don
quixote
de
la
mancha
the
religion
is
dead
as
demeter
and
its
art
alone
survives
as
on
the
whole
the
highest
expression
of
thought
or
emotion
but
in
its
day
it
was
almost
as
practical
as
it
now
is
fanciful
eleanor
and
her
daughter
mary
and
her
granddaughter
blanche
knew
as
well
as
saint
bernard
did
or
saint
francis
what
a
brute
the
emancipated
man
could
be
and
as
though
they
foresaw
the
society
of
the
sixteenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
they
used
every
terror
they
could
invent
as
well
as
every
tenderness
they
could
invoke
to
tame
the
beasts
around
them
their
charge
was
of
manners
and
to
teach
manners
they
made
a
school
which
they
called
their
court
of
love
with
a
code
of
law
to
which
they
gave
the
name
of
courteous
love
the
decisions
of
this
court
were
recorded
like
the
decisions
of
a
modern
bench
under
the
names
of
the
great
ladies
who
made
them
and
were
enforced
by
the
ladies
of
good
society
for
whose
guidance
they
were
made
they
are
worth
reading
and
any
one
who
likes
may
read
them
to
this
day
with
considerable
scepticism
about
their
genuineness
the
doubt
is
only
ignorance
we
do
not
and
never
can
know
the
woman
or
for
that
matter
any
other
woman
but
we
do
know
the
literature
she
created
we
know
the
art
she
lived
in
and
the
religion
she
professed
we
can
collect
from
them
some
idea
why
the
virgin
mary
ruled
and
what
she
was
taken
to
be
by
the
world
which
worshipped
her
mary
of
champagne
created
the
literature
of
courteous
love
she
must
have
been
about
twenty
years
old
when
she
married
count
henry
and
went
to
live
at
troyes
not
actually
a
queen
in
title
but
certainly
a
queen
in
social
influence
in
champagne
was
a
powerful
country
and
troyes
a
centre
of
taste
in
normandy
at
the
same
date
william
of
saint
pair
and
wace
were
writing
the
poetry
we
know
in
champagne
the
court
poet
was
christian
of
troyes
whose
poems
were
new
when
the
churches
of
noyon
and
senlis
and
saint
leu
and
the
fleche
of
chartres
and
the
leaning
tower
of
pisa
were
building
at
the
same
time
with
the
abbey
of
vezelay
and
before
the
church
at
mantes
christian
died
not
long
after
leaving
a
great
mass
of
verse
much
of
which
has
survived
and
which
you
can
read
more
easily
than
you
can
read
dante
or
petrarch
although
both
are
almost
modern
compared
with
christian
the
quality
of
this
verse
is
something
like
the
quality
of
the
glass
windows
conventional
decoration
colours
in
conventional
harmonies
refinement
restraint
and
feminine
delicacy
of
taste
christian
has
not
the
grand
manner
of
the
eleventh
century
and
never
recalls
the
masculine
strength
of
the
chanson
de
roland
or
raoul
de
cambrai
even
his
most
charming
story
erec
et
enide
carries
chiefly
a
moral
of
courtesy
his
is
work
says
gaston
paris
the
flower
of
a
court
and
of
french
the
best
example
of
an
admirable
language
but
not
lyric
neither
strong
nor
deep
nor
deeply
felt
what
we
call
tragedy
is
unknown
to
it
christian
world
is
and
rose
with
only
enough
red
to
give
it
warmth
and
so
flooded
with
light
that
even
its
mysteries
count
only
by
the
clearness
with
which
they
are
shown
among
other
great
works
before
mary
of
france
came
to
troyes
christian
had
toward
written
a
tristan
which
is
lost
mary
herself
he
says
gave
him
the
subject
of
lancelot
with
the
request
or
order
to
make
it
a
lesson
of
courteous
love
which
he
obeyed
courtesy
has
lost
its
meaning
as
well
as
its
charm
and
you
might
find
the
chevalier
de
la
charette
even
more
unintelligible
than
tiresome
but
its
influence
was
great
in
its
day
and
the
lesson
of
courteous
love
under
the
authority
of
mary
of
champagne
lasted
for
centuries
as
the
standard
of
taste
lancelot
was
never
finished
but
later
not
long
after
christian
wrote
a
perceval
or
conte
du
graal
which
must
also
have
been
intended
to
please
mary
and
which
is
interesting
because
while
the
lancelot
gave
the
idea
of
courteous
love
the
perceval
gave
the
idea
of
religious
mystery
mary
was
certainly
concerned
with
both
it
is
for
this
same
mary
says
gaston
paris
that
walter
of
arras
undertook
his
poem
of
she
was
the
object
of
the
songs
of
the
troubadours
as
well
as
of
their
french
imitators
for
her
use
also
she
caused
the
translations
of
books
of
piety
like
genesis
or
the
paraphrase
at
great
length
in
verse
of
the
psalm
with
her
theories
of
courteous
love
every
one
is
more
or
less
familiar
if
only
from
the
ridicule
of
cervantes
and
the
follies
of
quixote
who
though
four
hundred
years
younger
was
child
but
we
never
can
know
how
far
she
took
herself
and
her
laws
of
love
seriously
and
to
speculate
on
so
deep
a
subject
as
her
seriousness
is
worse
than
useless
since
she
would
herself
have
been
as
uncertain
as
her
lovers
were
visionary
as
the
courtesy
was
the
holy
grail
was
as
practical
as
any
that
has
survived
of
the
time
the
mystery
of
perceval
is
like
that
of
the
gothic
cathedral
illuminated
by
floods
of
light
and
enlivened
by
rivers
of
colour
unfortunately
christian
never
told
what
he
meant
by
the
fragment
itself
a
mystery
in
which
he
narrated
the
story
of
the
knight
who
saw
the
holy
grail
because
the
knight
who
was
warned
as
usual
to
ask
no
questions
for
once
unlike
most
knights
obeyed
the
warning
when
he
should
have
disregarded
it
as
necessarily
did
the
wrong
thing
in
order
to
make
their
adventures
possible
perceval
error
can
not
be
in
itself
mysterious
nor
was
the
castle
in
any
way
mysterious
where
the
miracle
occurred
it
appeared
to
him
to
be
the
usual
castle
and
he
saw
nothing
unusual
in
the
manner
of
his
reception
by
the
usual
old
lord
or
in
the
fact
that
both
seated
themselves
quite
simply
before
the
with
the
usual
household
then
as
though
it
were
an
everyday
habit
the
holy
grail
was
brought

and
within
the
hall
was
bright
as
any
hall
could
be
with
light
of
candles
in
a
house
at
night
so
while
of
this
and
that
they
talked
a
squire
from
a
chamber
walked
bearing
a
white
lance
in
his
hand
grasped
by
the
middle
like
a
wand
and
as
he
passed
the
chimney
wide
those
seated
by
the
fireside
and
all
the
others
caught
a
glance
of
the
white
steel
and
the
white
lance
as
they
looked
a
drop
of
blood
down
the
lance
handle
flowed
down
to
where
the
youth
hand
stood
from
the
at
the
top
they
saw
run
that
crimson
drop
presently
came
two
more
squires
in
their
hands
two
chandeliers
of
fine
gold
in
enamel
wrought
each
squire
that
the
candle
brought
was
a
handsome
chevalier
there
burned
in
every
chandelier
two
lighted
candles
at
the
least
a
damsel
graceful
and
well
dressed
behind
the
squires
followed
fast
who
carried
in
her
hands
a
graal
and
as
she
came
within
the
hall
with
the
graal
there
came
a
light
so
brilliant
that
the
candles
all
lost
clearness
as
the
stars
at
night
when
moon
shines
or
in
day
the
sun
after
her
there
followed
one
who
a
dish
of
silver
bore
the
graal
which
had
gone
before
of
gold
the
finest
had
been
made
with
precious
stones
had
been
inlaid
richest
and
rarest
of
each
kind
that
man
in
sea
or
earth
could
find
all
other
jewels
far
surpassed
those
which
the
holy
graal
enchased
just
as
before
had
passed
the
lance
they
all
before
the
bed
advance
passing
straightway
through
the
hall
and
the
knight
who
saw
them
pass
never
ventured
once
to
ask
for
the
meaning
of
the
graal
the
simplicity
of
this
narration
gives
a
certain
dramatic
effect
to
the
mystery
like
seeing
a
ghost
in
full
daylight
but
christian
carried
simplicity
further
still
he
seemed
either
to
feel
or
to
want
others
to
feel
the
reality
of
the
adventure
and
the
miracle
and
he
followed
up
the
appearance
of
the
graal
by
a
solid
meal
in
the
style
of
the
twelfth
century
such
as
one
expects
to
find
in
ivanhoe
or
the
talisman
the
knight
sat
down
with
his
host
to
the
best
dinner
that
the
county
of
champagne
afforded
and
they
ate
their
haunch
of
venison

the
graal
in

sat
before
the
fire
and

till

when
the
squires
made
up
the
beds
in
the
hall
and
brought
in
supper
dates
figs
nutmegs
spices
pomegranates
and
at

lectuaries
suspiciously
like
what

read
in

stories
of

perceval
awake
but
he
slept
the
sound
and
healthy
sleep
of
youth
and
when
he
woke
the
next
morning
he
felt
only
a
mild
surprise
to
find
that

and
household
had
disappeared

to

christian
wrote
about
perceval
in
in
the
same
spirit
in
which
the
workmen
in
glass
thirty
years
later
told
the
story
of
charlemagne
one
artist
worked
for
mary
of
champagne
the
others
for
mary
of
chartres
commonly
known
as
the
virgin
but
all
did
their
work
in
good
faith
with
the
first
fresh
easy
instinct
of
colour
light
and
line
neither
of
the
two
maries
was
mystical
in
a
modern
sense
none
of
the
artists
was
oppressed
by
the
burden
of
doubt
their
scepticism
was
as
childlike
as
faith
if
one
has
to
make
an
exception
perhaps
the
passion
of
love
was
more
serious
than
that
of
religion
and
gave
to
religion
the
deepest
emotion
and
the
most
complicated
one
which
society
knew
love
was
certainly
a
passion
and
even
more
certainly
it
was
as
seen
in
poets
like
dante
and
petrarch
in
romans
like
lancelot
and
aucassin
in
ideals
like
the
virgin
complicated
beyond
modern
conception
for
this
reason
the
loss
of
christian
tristan
makes
a
terrible
gap
in
art
for
christian
poem
would
have
given
the
first
and
best
idea
of
what
led
to
courteous
love
the
tristan
was
written
before
and
belonged
to
the
cycle
of
queen
eleanor
of
england
rather
than
to
that
of
her
daughter
mary
of
troyes
but
the
subject
was
one
neither
of
courtesy
nor
of
france
it
belonged
to
an
age
far
behind
the
eleventh
century
or
even
the
tenth
or
indeed
any
century
within
the
range
of
french
history
and
it
was
as
little
fitted
for
christian
way
of
treatment
as
for
any
avowed
burlesque
the
original
tristan
critics
say
was
not
french
and
neither
tristan
nor
isolde
had
ever
a
drop
of
french
blood
in
their
veins
in
their
form
as
christian
received
it
they
were
celts
or
scots
they
came
from
brittany
wales
ireland
the
northern
ocean
or
farther
still
behind
the
welsh
tristan
which
passed
probably
through
england
to
normandy
and
thence
to
france
and
champagne
critics
detect
a
far
more
ancient
figure
living
in
a
form
of
society
that
france
could
not
remember
ever
to
have
known
king
marc
was
a
tribal
chief
of
the
stone
age
whose
subjects
loved
the
forest
and
lived
on
the
sea
or
in
caves
king
marc
royal
hall
was
a
common
shelter
on
the
banks
of
a
stream
where
every
one
was
at
home
and
king
queen
knights
attendants
and
dwarf
slept
on
the
floor
on
beds
laid
down
where
they
pleased
tristan
weapons
were
the
bow
and
stone
knife
he
never
saw
a
horse
or
a
spear
his
ideas
of
loyalty
and
ideas
of
marriage
were
as
vague
as
marc
royal
authority
and
all
were
alike
unconscious
of
law
chivalry
or
church
the
note
they
sang
was
more
unlike
the
note
of
christian
if
possible
than
that
of
richard
wagner
it
was
the
simplest
expression
of
rude
and
primitive
love
as
one
could
perhaps
find
it
among
north
american
indians
though
hardly
so
defiant
even
there
and
certainly
in
the
icelandic
sagas
hardly
so
lawless
but
it
was
a
note
of
real
passion
and
touched
the
deepest
chords
of
sympathy
in
the
artificial
society
of
the
twelfth
century
as
it
did
in
that
of
the
nineteenth
the
task
of
the
french
poet
was
to
tone
it
down
and
give
it
the
fashionable
dress
the
pointed
shoes
and
long
sleeves
of
the
time
the
frenchman
says
gaston
paris
is
specially
interested
in
making
his
story
entertaining
for
the
society
it
is
meant
for
he
is
that
is
of
the
world
he
smiles
at
the
adventures
he
tells
and
delicately
lets
you
see
that
he
is
not
their
dupe
he
exerts
himself
to
give
to
his
style
a
constant
elegance
a
uniform
polish
in
which
a
few
neatly
turned
clever
phrases
sparkle
here
and
there
above
all
he
wants
to
please
and
thinks
of
his
audience
more
than
of
his
subject
in
the
twelfth
century
he
wanted
chiefly
to
please
women
as
orderic
complained
isolde
came
out
of
brittany
to
meet
eleanor
coming
up
from
guienne
and
the
virgin
from
the
east
and
all
united
in
giving
law
to
society
in
each
case
it
was
the
woman
not
the
man
who
gave
the
law
it
was
mary
not
the
trinity
eleanor
not
louis
vii
isolde
not
tristan
no
doubt
the
original
tristan
had
given
the
law
like
roland
or
achilles
but
the
tristan
was
a
comparatively
poor
creature
he
was
in
his
way
a
secondary
figure
in
the
romance
as
louis
vii
was
to
eleanor
and
abelard
to
heloise
every
one
knows
how
about
twenty
years
before
eleanor
came
to
paris
the
abelard
the
hero
of
the
latin
quarter
had
sung
to
heloise
those
songs
which
he
tells
us
resounded
through
europe
as
widely
as
his
scholastic
fame
and
probably
to
more
effect
for
his
renown
in
popular
notions
heloise
was
isolde
and
would
in
a
moment
have
done
what
isolde
did

at

in
the
public

have
taken
abelard
by

gone

much
more
readily
than
she
went

but
abelard
would
have
made
a
poor
figure
as
tristan
abelard
and
christian
of
troyes
were
as
remote
as
we
are
from
the
legendary
tristan
but
isolde

eleanor
and

were
the
immortal

the

of
isolde
both
in

and
the
later
version
seems
to
have
served
as
a
sacred
book
to
the
women
of
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
and
christian
isolde
surely
helped
mary
in
giving
law
to
the
court
of
troyes
and
decisions
in
the
court
of

countess

lasted
from
to
years
during

at
uncertain
intervals
glimpses
of
her
influence
flash
out
in

christian

not

was

he
also
composed
better

who
is
known
to
tourists
and
when
he
spoke
to
his
sister
in
this
cry
of
the
heart
altogether
singular
among
monarchs
he
made
law
and
style
above
discussion
whether
he
meant
to
reproach
his
other
sister
alix
of
chartres
historians
may
tell
if
they
know
if
he
did
the
reproach
answered
its
purpose
for
the

written

richard

ransomed

in
and
in
the
young
count
loweis
of

leagued
with

counts
of

against

to
whom
they
rendered
homage
in
any
case
neither
mary
nor
alice
in
was
reigning
countess
mary
was
a
widow
since
and
her
son
henry
was
count
in
champagne
apparently
a
great
favourite
with
his
uncle
richard
the
life
of
this
henry
of
champagne
was
another
romance
but
can
serve
no
purpose
here
except
to
recall
the
story
that
his
mother
the
great
countess
mary
died
in
of
sorrow
for
the
death
of
this
son
who
was
then
king
of
jerusalem
and
was
killed
in
by
a
fall
from
the
window
of
his
palace
at
acre
died
in
in
mary
other
son
who
succeeded
henry
count
thibaut
iii
died
leaving
a
posthumous
heir
famous
in
the
thirteenth
century
as
the
thibaut
of
queen
blanche
they
were
all
astonishing
men
and
women
and
filled
the
world
for
two
hundred
years
with
their
extraordinary
energy
and
genius
but
the
greatest
of
all
was
old
queen
eleanor
who
survived
her
son
as
well
as
her
two
husbands
and
henry
ii
plantagenet
and
was
left
in
still
struggling
to
repair
the
evils
and
fend
off
the
dangers
they
caused
queen
by
the
wrath
of
god
she
called
herself
and
she
knew
what
just
claim
she
had
to
the
rank
of
her
two
husbands
and
ten
children
little
remained
except
her
son
john
who
by
the
unanimous
voice
of
his
family
his
friends
his
enemies
and
even
his
admirers
achieved
a
reputation
for
excelling
in
every
form
of
crime
he
was
a
liar
and
a
traitor
as
was
not
uncommon
but
he
was
thought
to
be
also
a
coward
which
in
that
family
was
singular
some
redeeming
quality
he
must
have
had
but
none
is
recorded
his
mother
saw
him
running
in
his
masculine
recklessness
to
destruction
and
she
made
a
last
and
a
characteristic
effort
to
save
him
and
guienne
by
a
treaty
of
amity
with
the
french
king
to
be
secured
by
the
marriage
of
the
heir
of
france
louis
to
granddaughter
john
niece
blanche
of
castile
then
twelve
or
thirteen
years
old
eleanor
herself
was
eighty
and
yet
she
made
the
journey
to
spain
brought
back
the
child
to
bordeaux
affianced
her
to
louis
viii
as
she
had
herself
been
affianced
in
to
louis
vii
and
in
may
saw
her
married
the
french
had
then
given
up
their
conventional
trick
of
attributing
eleanor
acts
to
her
want
of
morals
and
france
gave
her
as
to
most
women
after
sixty
years
old
the
benefit
of
the
convention
which
made
women
respectable
after
they
had
lost
the
opportunity
to
be
vicious
in
french
eyes
eleanor
played
out
the
drama
according
to
the
rules
she
could
not
save
john
but
she
died
in
before
his
ruin
and
you
can
still
see
her
lying
with
her
husband
and
her
son
richard
at
fontevrault
in
her
tomb
in
blanche
became
queen
of
france
she
was
years
old
her
husband
louis
viii
was
ambitious
to
rival
his
father
philip
augustus
who
had
seized
normandy
in
louis
undertook
to
seize
toulouse
and
avignon
in
he
set
out
with
a
large
army
in
which
among
the
chief
vassals
his
cousin
thibaut
of
champagne
led
a
contingent
thibaut
was
years
old
and
like
pierre
de
dreux
then
duke
of
brittany
was
one
of
the
most
brilliant
and
versatile
men
of
his
time
and
one
of
the
greatest
rulers
as
royal
vassal
thibaut
owed
forty
days
service
in
the
field
but
his
interests
were
at
variance
with
the
king
and
at
the
end
of
the
term
he
marched
home
with
his
men
leaving
the
king
to
fall
ill
and
die
in
auvergne
november
and
a
child
of
ten
years
old
to
carry
on
the
government
as
louis
ix
chartres
cathedral
has
already
told
the
story
twice
in
stone
and
glass
but
thibaut
does
not
appear
there
although
he
saved
the
queen
some
member
of
the
royal
family
must
be
regent
queen
blanche
took
the
place
and
of
course
the
princes
of
the
blood
who
thought
it
was
their
right
united
against
her
at
first
blanche
turned
violently
on
thibaut
and
forbade
him
to
appear
at
the
coronation
at
rheims
in
his
own
territory
on
november
as
though
she
held
him
guilty
of
treason
but
when
the
league
of
great
vassals
united
to
deprive
her
of
the
regency
she
had
no
choice
but
to
detach
at
any
cost
any
member
of
the
league
and
thibaut
alone
offered
help
what
price
she
paid
him
was
best
known
to
her
but
what
price
she
would
be
believed
to
have
paid
him
was
as
well
known
to
her
as
what
had
been
said
of
her
grandmother
eleanor
when
she
changed
her
allegiance
in
if
the
scandal
had
concerned
thibaut
alone
she
might
have
been
well
content
but
blanche
was
obliged
also
to
pay
desperate
court
to
the
papal
legate
every
member
of
her
husband
family
united
against
her
and
libelled
her
character
with
the
freedom
which
enlivened
and
envenomed
royal
tongues
maintes

tristan
had
this
been
all
she
would
have
cared
no
more
than
eleanor
or
any
other
queen
had
cared
for
in
french
drama
real
or
imaginary
such
charges
were
not
very
serious
and
hardly
uncomplimentary
but
iseult
had
never
been
accused
over
and
above
her
arbitrary
views
on
the
of
acting
as
an
accomplice
with
tristan
in
poisoning
king
marc
french
convention
required
that
thibaut
should
have
poisoned
louis
viii
for
love
of
the
queen
and
that
this
secret
reciprocal
love
should
control
their
lives
fortunately
for
blanche
she
was
a
devout
ally
of
the
church
and
the
church
believed
evil
only
of
enemies
the
legate
and
the
prelates
rallied
to
her
support
and
after
eight
years
of
desperate
struggle
they
crushed
pierre
mauclerc
and
saved
thibaut
and
blanche
for
us
the
poetry
is
history
and
the
facts
are
false
french
art
starts
not
from
facts
but
from
certain
assumptions
as
conventional
as
a
legendary
window
and
the
commonest
convention
is
the
woman
the
fact
then
as
now
was
power
or
its
equivalent
in

frenchmen

off

they
were

their
loves
were
as

as

the

courteous

was

a
form
of

courteous
love
in
thibaut
hands

in

as
substantial

the
middle

had
reflected
only
what
was
practical
nothing
would
have
survived
for
us
thibaut
was
tristan
and
is
said
to
have
painted
his
verses
on
the
walls
of
his

he
did
he
painted
there
in
the
opinion

poetry
than
any

was

for
thibaut
was
a
great
prince
and
great
poet
who
did
in
both
characters
whatever
he
pleased
in
modern
equivalents
one
would
give
much
to
see
the

the

lost

still
keeps

thibaut
verse
sound
simple
it
is
the
simplicity
of
the

so
refined
and
complicated
that
sensible
people
are
mostly
satisfied
to
feel
and
not
to
understand
any
blunderer
in
verse
who
will
merely
look
at
the
rhymes
of
these
three
stanzas
will
see
that
simplicity
is
about
as
much
concerned
there
as
it
is
with

the

are
as
perfect
as
the

and
the

as
elaborate
these

see
how

courteous

praise

with

no
man

such

sick
with
ever
such
sickness

he
shall
if
he
hear
this
recover

so
sweet
it
is
this
little
gem
is
called
a
a
story
partly
in
prose
partly
in
verse
to
be
sung
according
to
musical
notation
accompanying
the
words
in
the
single
manuscript
known
and
published
in
facsimile
by
bourdillon
at
oxford
in
indeed
few
poems
old
or
new
have
in
the
last
few
years
been
more
reprinted
translated
and
discussed
than
aucassins
yet
the
discussion
lacks
interest
to
the
idle
tourist
and
tells
him
little
nothing
is
known
of
the
author
or
his
date
the
second
line
alone
offers
a
hint
but
nothing
more
caitif
means
in
the
first
place
a
captive
and
secondly
any
unfortunate
or
wretched
man
critics
have
liked
to
think
that
the
word
means
here
a
captive
to
the
saracens
and
that
the
poet
like
cervantes
three
or
four
hundred
years
later
may
have
been
a
prisoner
to
the
infidels
what
the
critics
can
do
we
can
do
if
liberties
can
be
taken
with
impunity
by
scholars
we
can
take
the
liberty
of
supposing
that
the
poet
was
a
prisoner
in
the
crusade
of
and
auguste
that
he
had
recovered
his
liberty
with
his
master
in
and
that
he
passed
the
rest
of
his
life
singing
to
the
old
queen
eleanor
or
to
richard
at
chinon
and
to
the
lords
of
all
the
chateaux
in
guienne
poitiers
anjou
and
normandy
not
to
mention
england
the
living
was
a
pleasant
one
as
the
sunny
atmosphere
of

the
who
composed
and
recited
aucassins
could
not
have
been
unhappy
but
this
is
the
affair
of
his
private
life
and
not
of
ours
what
rather
interests
us
is
his
poetic
motive
courteous
love
which
gives
the
tale
a
place
in
the
direct
line
between
christian
of
troyes
and
william
of
lorris
christian

troyes
died
in
at
least
he
wrote
nothing
of
a

as

soon
after

death
of

of

in
or
thereabouts
for
our
purposes
aucassins
comes
between
christian
of
troyes
and
william
of
lorris
the
trouvere
or
jogleor
who
sang
was
a
viel
caitif
when
the
chartres
glass
was
set
up
and
the
charlemagne
window
designed
about
or
perhaps
a
little
later
when
one
is
not
a
professor
one
has
not
the
right
to
make
inept
guesses
and
when
one
is
not
a
critic
one
should
not
risk
confusing
a
difficult
question
by
baseless
assumptions
but
even
a
summer
tourist
may
without
offence
visit
his
churches
in
the
order
that
suits
him
best
and
for
our
tour
aucassins
follows
christian
and
goes
hand
in
hand
with
blondel
and
the
chatelain
de
coucy
as
the
most
exquisite
expression
of
courteous
love
as
one
of
aucassins
german
editors
says
in
his
introduction
love
is
the
medium
through
which
alone
the
hero
surveys
the
world
around
him
and
for
which
he
contemns
everything
that
the
age
prized
knightly
honour
deeds
of
arms
father
and
mother
hell
and
even
heaven
but
the
mere
promise
by
his
father
of
a
kiss
from
nicolette
inspires
him
to
superhuman
heroism
while
the
old
poet
sings
and
smiles
aside
to
his
audience
as
though
he
wished
them
to
understand
that
aucassins
a
foolish
boy
must
not
be
judged
quite
seriously
but
that
old
as
he
was
himself
he
was
just
as
foolish
about
nicolette
aucassins
was
the
son
of
the
count
of
beaucaire
nicolette
was
a
young
girl
whom
the
viscount
of
beaucaire
had
redeemed
as
a
captive
of
the
saracens
and
had
brought
up
as
a
in
his
family
aucassins
fell
in
love
with
nicolette
and
wanted
to
marry
her
the
action
turned
on
marriage
for
to
the
counts
of
beaucaire
as
to
other
counts
not
to
speak
of
kings
high
alliance
was
not
a
matter
of
choice
but
of
necessity
without
which
they
could
not
defend
their
lives
let
alone
their
counties
and
to
make
conduct
absolutely
treasonable
beaucaire
was
at
that
time
surrounded
and
besieged
and
the
count
aucassins
father
stood
in
dire
need
of
his
son
help
aucassins
refused
to
stir
unless
he
could
have
nicolette
what
were
honours
to
him
if
nicolette
were
not
to
share
them

so
the

goes
no

such
people
as
i
will
tell
you
of
there
go
old
priests
and
old
cripples
and
the
maimed
who
all
day
and
all
night
crouch
before
altars
and
in
old
crypts
and
are
clothed
with
old
capes
and
old
tattered
rags
who
are
naked
and
footbare
and
sore
who
die
of
hunger
and
want
and
misery
these
go
to
paradise
with
them
i
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
hell
i
am
willing
to
go
for
to
hell
go
the
fine
scholars
and
the
fair
knights
who
die
in
tournies
and
in
glorious
wars
and
the
good
and
the
with
them
i
will
gladly
go
and
there
go
the
fair
courteous
ladies
whether
they
have
two
or
three
friends
besides
their
lords
and
the
gold
and
silver
go
there
and
the
ermines
and
sables
and
there
go
the
harpers
and
jongleurs
and
the
kings
of
the
world
with
these
will
i
go
if
only
i
may
have
nicolette
my
very
sweet
friend
with
me
three
times
in
these
short
extracts
the
word
courteous
has
already
appeared
the
story
itself
is
promised
as
courteous
nicolette
is
courteous
and
the
ladies
who
are
not
to
go
to
heaven
are
courteous
aucassins
is
in
the
full
tide
of
courtesy
and
evidently
a
professional
or
he
never
would
have
claimed
a
place
for
harpers
and
jongleurs
with
kings
and
chevaliers
in
the
next
world
the
poets
of
courteous
love
showed
as
little
interest
in
religion
as
the
poets
of
the
eleventh
century
had
shown
for
it
in
their
poems
of
war
aucassins
resembled
christian
of
troyes
in
this
and
both
of
them
resembled
thibaut
while
william
of
lorris
went
beyond
them
all
the
literature
of
the
siecle
was
always
unreligious
from
the
chanson
de
roland
to
the
tragedy
of
hamlet
to
be
papelard
was
unworthy
of
a
chevalier
the
true
knight
of
courtesy
made
nothing
of
defying
the
torments
of
hell
as
he
defied
the
lance
of
a
rival
the
frowns
of
society
the
threats
of
parents
or
the
terrors
of
magic
the
perfect
gentle
courteous
lover
thought
of
nothing
but
his
love
whether
the
object
of
his
love
were
nicolette
of
beaucaire
or
blanche
of
castile
mary
of
champagne
or
mary
of
chartres
was
a
detail
which
did
not
affect
the
devotion
of
his
worship
so
nicolette
shut
up
in
a
vaulted
chamber
leaned
out
at
the
marble
window
and
sang
while
aucassins
when
his
father
promised
that
he
should
have
a
kiss
from
nicolette
went
out
to
make
fabulous
slaughter
of
the
enemy
and
when
his
father
broke
the
promise
shut
himself
up
in
his
chamber
and
also
sang
and
the
action
went
on
by
scenes
and
interludes
until
one
night
nicolette
let
herself
down
from
the
window
by
the
help
of
sheets
and
towels
into
the
garden
and
with
a
natural
dislike
of
wetting
her
skirts
which
has
delighted
every
hearer
or
reader
from
that
day
to
this
prist
se

she
raised
her
skirts
with
one
hand
in
front
and
the
other
behind
for
the
dew
which
she
saw
heavy
on
the
grass
and
went
off
down
the
garden
to
the
tower
where
aucassins
was
locked
up
and
sang
to
him
through
a
crack
in
the
masonry
and
gave
him
a
lock
of
her
hair
and
they
talked
till
the
friendly
came
by
and
warned
her
by
a
chant
that
she
had
better
escape
so
she
bade
farewell
to
aucassins
and
went
on
to
a
breach
in
the
city
wall
and
she
looked
through
it
down
into
the
fosse
which
was
very
deep
and
very
steep
so
she
sang
to
herself

wolves
and
wild

terribly
of
which
plenty
there
there
be
the
lions
were
a
touch
of
poetic
licence
even
for
beaucaire
but
the
wolves
and
wild
boars
were
real
enough
yet
nicolette
feared
even
them
less
than
she
feared
the
count
so
she
slid
down
what
her
audience
well
knew
to
be
a
most
dangerous
and
difficult
descent
and
reached
the
bottom
with
many
wounds
in
her
hands
and
feet
et
san
en
sali
bien
en
xii
lius
so
that
blood
was
drawn
in
a
dozen
places
and
then
she
climbed
up
the
other
side
and
went
off
bravely
into
the
depths
of
the
forest
an
uncanny
thing
to
do
by
night
as
you
can
still
see
then
followed
a
pastoral
which
might
be
taken
from
the
works
of
another
poet
of
the
same
period
whose
acquaintance
no
one
can
neglect
to
make
adam
de
la
halle
a
picard
of
arras
adam
lived
it
is
true
fifty
years
later
than
the
date
imagined
for
aucassins
but
his
shepherds
and
shepherdesses
are
not
so
much
like
as
identical
with
those
of
the
southern
poet
and
all
have
so
singular
an
air
of
life
that
the
conventional
courteous
knight
fades
out
beside
them
the
poet
whether
bourgeois
professional
noble
or
clerical
never
much
loved
the
peasant
and
the
peasant
never
much
loved
him
or
any
one
else
the
peasant
was
a
class
by
himself
and
his
trait
as
a
class
was
suspicion
of
everybody
and
all
things
whether
material
social
or
divine
naturally
he
detested
his
lord
whether
temporal
or
spiritual
because
the
seigneur
and
the
priest
took
his
earnings
but
he
was
never
servile
though
a
serf
he
was
far
from
civil
he
was
commonly
gross
he
was
cruel
but
not
more
so
than
his
betters
and
his
morals
were
no
worse
the
object
of
oppression
on
all
sides
the
invariable
victim
whoever
else
might
escape
the
french
peasant
as
a
class
held
his
own
and
more
in
fact
he
succeeded
in
plundering
church
crown
nobility
and
bourgeoisie
and
was
the
only
class
in
french
history
that
rose
steadily
in
power
and
from
the
time
of
the
crusades
to
the
present
day
whatever
his
occasional
suffering
may
have
been
and
in
the
thirteenth
century
he
was
suffering
when
nicolette
on
the
morning
after
her
escape
came
upon
a
group
of
peasants
in
the
forest
tending
the
count
cattle
she
had
reason
to
be
afraid
of
them
but
instead
they
were
afraid
of
her
they
thought
at
first
that
she
was
a
fairy
when
they
guessed
the
riddle
they
kept
the
secret
though
they
risked
punishment
and
lost
the
chance
of
reward
by
protecting
her
worse
than
this
they
agreed
for
a
small
present
to
give
a
message
to
aucassins
if
he
should
ride
that
way
aucassins
was
not
very
bright
but
when
he
got
out
of
prison
after
nicolette
escape
he
did
ride
out
at
his
friends
suggestion
and
tried
to
learn
what
had
become
of
her
passing
through
the
woods
he
came
upon
the
same
group
of
shepherds
and
shepherdesses
esmeres
et
martinet
fruelins
et
johannes
robecons
et
aubries
who
might
have
been
living
in
the
forest
of
arden
so
like
were
they
to
the
clowns
of
shakespeare
they
were
singing
of
nicolette
and
her
present
and
the
cakes
and
knives
and
flute
they
would
buy
with
it
aucassins
jumped
to
the
bait
they
offered
him
and
they
instantly
began
to
play
him
as
though
he
were
a
trout

said
aucassins
do
you

yes
we
know
very
well
that
you
are
aucassins
our
young

but
we
are

we
belong

fair

indeed
you
do

i
pray
you
listen
for

of
god
said

why
should
i
sing
for
you
if
it
does
not

when
there
is
no
man
so
powerful
in

except
count
garin
if
he
found
my

or
my

or
my

in
his
pasture
or
his
close
would
not
rather
risk
losing
his
eyes
than
dare
to
turn
them
out
and
why
should
i
sing
for
you
if
it
does
not
suit
me
so
god
help
you
good
child
indeed
you
will
do
it
and
take
these

the
money
we
will
take
but
i
not
sing
to
you
for
sworn
it
but
i
will
tell
it
you
if
you
like
for
god
sake
said
aucassins
better
telling
than
nothing
ten
sous
was
no
small
gift
twenty
sous
was
the
value
of
a
strong
ox
the
poet
put
a
high
on
the
force
of
love
but
he
set
a
higher
value
on
it
in
courtesy
these
boors
were
openly
insolent
to
their
young
lord
trying
to
extort
money
from
him
and
threatening
him
with
telling
his
father
but
they
were
in
their
right
and
nicolette
was
in
their
power
at
heart
they
meant
aucassins
well
but
they
were
rude
and
grasping
and
the
poet
used
them
in
order
to
show
how
love
made
the
true
lover
courteous
even
to
clowns
aucassins
gentle
courtesy
is
brought
out
by
the
greed
as
the
colours
in
the
window
were
brought
out
and
given
their
value
by
a
bit
of
blue
or
green
the
poet
having
got
his
little
touch
of
colour
rightly
placed
let
the
peasants
go
cil
qui
fu
plus
enparles
des
autres
having
been
given
his
way
and
his
money
told
aucassins
what
he
knew
of
nicolette
and
her
message
so
aucassins
put
spurs
to
his
horse
and
cantered
into
the
forest
singing
se
diu
plaist
le
pere
fort
je
vos
reverai
encore
suer
douce
so
please
god
great
and
strong
i
will
find
you
now
ere
long
sister
sweet
friend
but
the
peasant
had
singular
attraction
for
the
poet
whether
the
character
gave
him
a
chance
for
some
clever
mimicry
which
was
one
of
his
strong
points
as
a
or
whether
he
wanted
to
treat
his
subjects
like
the
legendary
windows
in
pairs
or
whether
he
felt
that
the
specially
amused
his
audience
he
immediately
introduced
a
peasant
of
another
class
much
more
strongly
coloured
or
deeply
shadowed
every
one
in
the
audience
was
and
for
that
matter
still
would
be
familiar
with
the
great
forests
the
home
of
half
the
fairy
and
nursery
tales
of
europe
still
wild
enough
and
extensive
enough
to
hide
in
although
they
have
now
comparatively
few
lions
and
not
many
wolves
or
wild
boars
or
serpents
such
as
nicolette
feared
every
one
saw
without
an
effort
the
young
damoiseau
riding
out
with
his
hound
or
hawk
looking
for
game
the
lanes
under
the
trees
through
the
wood
or
the
thick
underbrush
before
lanes
were
made
the
herdsmen
watching
their
herds
and
keeping
a
sharp
for
wolves
the
peasant
seeking
lost
cattle
the
black
burning
charcoal
and
in
the
depths
of
the
rocks
or
swamps
or
thickets
the
outlaw
even
now
forests
like
rambouillet
or
fontainebleau
or
compiegne
are
enormous
and
wild
one
can
see
aucassins
breaking
his
way
through
thorns
and
branches
in
search
of
nicolette
tearing
his
clothes
and
wounding
himself
en
xl

until
evening
approached
and
he
began
to
weep
for
disappointment

as
he
looked
before
him
along
the
way
he
saw
a
man
such
as
i
will
tell
you
tall
he
was
and
menacing
and
ugly
and
hideous
he
had
a
great
mane
blacker
than
charcoal
and
had
more
than
a
full
width
between
his
two
eyes
and
had
big
cheeks
and
a
huge
flat
nose
and
great
broad
nostrils
and
thick
lips
redder
than
raw
beef
and
large
ugly
yellow
teeth
and
was
shod
with
hose
and
leggings
of
raw
hide
laced
with
bark
cord
to
above
the
knee
and
was
muffled
in
a
cloak
without
lining
and
was
leaning
on
a
great
club
aucassins
came
upon
him
suddenly
and
had
great
fear
when
he
saw
him

seemed
to
think
this
an
equal
bargain
all
damoiseaux
were
not
as
courteous
as
aucassins
nor
all
varlets
as
rude
as
his
peasants
we
shall
see
how
the
young
gentlemen
of
picardy
treated
the
peasantry
for
no
offence
at
all
but
aucassins
carried
a
softer
southern
temper
in
a
happier
climate
and
with
his
invariable
gentle
courtesy
took
no
offence
at
the
familiarity
with
which
the
ploughman
treated
him
yet
he
dared
not
tell
the
truth
so
he
invented
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
an
excuse
he
has
lost
he
said
a
beautiful
white
hound

said
he
by
the
heart
god
had
in
his
body
that
you
should
cry
for
a
stinking
dog
bad
luck
to
him
who
ever
prizes
you
when
there
is
no
man
in
this
land
so
great
if
your
father
sent
to
him
for
ten
or
fifteen
or
twenty
but
would
fetch
them
very
gladly
and
be
only
too
pleased
but
i
ought
to
cry
and
mourn
and
why
you
brother
sir
i
will
tell
you
i
was
hired
out
to
a
rich
farmer
to
drive
his
plough
there
were
four
oxen
now
three
days
ago
i
had
a
great
misfortune
for
i
lost
the
best
of
my
oxen
roget
the
best
of
my
team
i
am
looking
to
find
him
i
not
eaten
or
drunk
these
three
days
past
i
dare
go
to
the
town
for
they
would
put
me
in
prison
as
i
nothing
to
pay
with
in
all
the
world
i
not
the
worth
of
anything
but
what
you
see
on
my
body
i
a
poor
old
mother
who
owned
nothing
but
a
feather
mattress
and
they
dragged
it
from
under
her
back
so
she
lies
on
the
bare
straw
and
she
troubles
me
more
than
myself
for
riches
come
and
go
if
i
lose
to
day
i
gain
i
will
pay
for
my
ox
when
i
can
and
will
not
cry
for
that
and
you
cry
for
a
filthy
dog
bad
luck
to
him
who
ever
thinks
well
of
you
truly
you
counsel
well
good
brother
god
bless
you
and
what
was
your
ox
worth
sir
they
ask
me
twenty
sous
for
it
i
can
not
beat
them
down
a
single
centime
here
are
twenty
said
aucassins
that
i
have
in

for
your

said
he
many
thanks
and

find
what
you
seek
the
little
episode
was
thrown
in
without
rhyme
or
reason
to
the
rapid
emotion
of
the
as
though
the
jongleur
were
showing
his
own
cleverness
and
humour
at
the
expense
of
his
hero
as
jongleurs
had
a
way
of
doing
but
he
took
no
such
liberties
with
his
heroine
while
aucassins
tore
through
the
thickets
on
horseback
crying
aloud
nicolette
had
built
herself
a
little
hut
in
the
depths
of
the
forest

so
she
twined
the
lilies
flower
roofed
with
leafy
branches
made
of
it
a
lovely
bower
with
the
freshest
grass
for
floor
such
as
never
mortal
saw
by
god
verity
she
swore
should
aucassins
pass
her
door
and
not
stop
for
love
of
her
to
repose
a
moment
there
he
should
be
her
love
no
more
nor
she
his
dear
so
night
came
on
and
nicolette
went
to
sleep
a
little
distance
away
from
her
hut
aucassins
at
last
came
by
and
dismounted
spraining
his
shoulder
in
doing
it
then
he
crept
into
the
little
hut
and
lying
on
his
back
looked
up
through
the
leaves
to
the
moon
and
sang

that
the

through

nicolette

where
you
are
my
own
love
with
the
blonde

i

must
want
her

down
upon

here
that
the

should
all

how
nicolette
heard
him
sing
and
came
to
him
and
rubbed
his
shoulder
and
dressed
his
wounds
as
though
he
were
a
child
and
how
in
the
morning
they
rode
away
together
like
tennyson
sleeping
beauty
the
hills
and
far
away
beyond
their
utmost
purple
rim
beyond
the
night
beyond
the
day
singing
as
they
rode
the
story
goes
on
to
tell
or
to
sing

the

in

his

he

what
say
you

where
we

while
you
on

ride
so
they
pass
by

and

and
the
city
and
the
town
till
they
reach
the
morning
pale
and
on
set
them
down
hard
by
the
shore
there
we
will
leave
them
for
their
further
adventures
have
not
much
to
do
with
our
matter
like
all
the
romans
or
nearly
all
aucassins
is
singularly
pure
and
refined
apparently
the
ladies
of
courteous
love
frowned
on
coarseness
and
allowed
no
licence
their
power
must
have
been
great
for
the
best
romans
are
as
free
from
grossness
as
the
chanson
de
roland
itself
or
the
church
glass
or
the
illuminations
in
the
manuscripts
and
as
long
as
the
power
of
the
church
ruled
good
society
this
decency
continued
as
far
as
women
were
concerned
they
seem
always
to
have
been
more
clean
than
the
men
except
when
men
painted
them
in
colours
which
men
liked
best
perhaps
society
was
actually
cleaner
in
the
thirteenth
century
than
in
the
sixteenth
as
saint
louis
was
more
decent
than
francis
i
and
as
the
bath
was
habitual
in
the
twelfth
century
and
exceptional
at
the
renaissance
the
rule
held
good
for
the
bourgeoisie
as
well
as
among
the
dames
cortoises
christian
and
thibaut
aucassins
and
the
roman
de
la
rose
may
have
expressed
only
the
tastes
of
born
ladies
but
other
poems
were
avowedly
bourgeois
and
among
the
bourgeois
poets
none
was
better
than
adam
de
la
halle
adam
wrote
also
for
the
court
or
at
least
for
robert
of
artois
saint
nephew
whom
he
followed
to
naples
in
but
his
poetry
was
as
little
aristocratic
as
poetry
could
well
be
and
most
of
it
was
cynically
almost
defiantly
as
though
the
weavers
of
arras
were
his
only
audience
and
recognized
him
and
the
objects
of
his
satire
in
every
verse
the
bitter
personalities
do
not
concern
us
but
at
naples
to
amuse
robert
of
artois
and
his
court
adam
composed
the
first
of
french
comic
operas
which
had
an
immense
success
and
as
a
pastoral
poem
has
it
still
the
idyll
of
arras
was
a
singular
contrast
to
the
idyll
of
beaucaire
but
the
social
value
was
the
same
in
both
robin
and
marion
were
a
pendant
to
aucassins
and
nicolette
robin
was
almost
a
burlesque
on
aucassins
while
marion
was
a
northern
energetic
intelligent
pastoral
nicolette
li
gieus
de
robin
et
de
marion
had
little
or
no
plot
adam
strung
together
on
a
thread
of
dialogue
and
by
a
group
of
suitable
figures
a
number
of
the
favourite
songs
of
his
time
followed
by
the
favourite
games
and
ending
with
a
favourite
dance
the
tresca
the
songs
the
games
and
the
dances
do
not
concern
us
but
the
dialogue
runs
along
prettily
with
an
air
of
flemish
realism
like
a
picture
of
teniers
as
unlike
that
of
courtoisie
as
teniers
was
to
guido
reni
underneath
it
all
a
tone
of
satire
made
itself
felt
enough
but
directed
wholly
against
the
men
the
scene
opens
on
marion
tending
her
sheep
and
singing
the
pretty
air
robin
robin
after
which
enters
a
chevalier
or
esquire
on
horseback
and
sings
je
me
repairoie
du
tournoiement
then
follows
a
dialogue
between
the
chevalier
and
marion
with
no
other
object
than
to
show
off
the
charm
of
marion
against
the
masculine
defects
of
the
knight
being
like
most
squires
somewhat
slow
of
ideas
in
conversation
with
young
women
the
gentleman
began
by
asking
for
sport
for
his
falcon
has
she
seen
any
duck
down
by
the
river
mais
veis
tu
par
chi
devant
vers
ceste
riviere
nul
ane
ane
it
seems
was
the
usual
word
for
wild
duck
the
prey
and
marion
knew
it
as
well
as
he
but
she
chose
to
misunderstand
him
une

it
is
a
beast
that
brays
i
saw
three
yesterday
on
the
road
all
with
loads
going
to
the
mill
is
that
what
you
ask
that
is
not
what
the
squire
has
asked
and
he
is
conscious
that
marion
knows
it
but
he
tries
again
if
she
has
not
seen
a
duck
perhaps
she
has
seen
a
heron
hairons

by

when
i
saw
some

at
my
grandmother
dame
emma
who
owns
these
sheep
hairons
it
seems
meant
also
herring
and
this
wilful
misunderstanding
struck
the
chevalier
as
carrying
jest
too
far
par

esbaubis
mais
je
ne
fui
si
gabes
on
my
word
i
am
silenced
never
in
my
life
was
i
so
chaffed
marion
herself
seems
to
think
her
joke
a
little
too
evident
for
she
takes
up
the
conversation
in
her
turn
only
to
conclude
that
she
likes
robin
better
than
she
does
the
knight
he
is
gayer
and
when
he
plays
his
musette
he
starts
the
whole
village
dancing
at
this
the
squire
makes
a
declaration
of
love
with
such
energy
as
to
spur
his
horse
almost
over
her
aimi
sirel
ostez
vo
cheval
a
poi
que
il
ne
blechie
li
robin
ne
regiete

quand
je
voie
apres
se
karue
aimi
is
an
exclamation
of
alarm
real
or
affected
dear
me
sir
take
your
horse
away
he
almost
hurt
me
robin
horse
never
rears
when
i
go
behind
his
plough
still
the
knight
persists
and
though
marion
still
tells
him
to
go
away
she
asks
his
name
which
he
says
is
aubert
and
so
gives
her
the
catchword
for
another
song
vos
perdes
vo
paine
sire
aubert
which
ends
the
scene
with
a
duo
the
second
scene
begins
with
a
duo
of
marion
and
robin
followed
by
her
giving
a
softened
account
of
the
chevalier
behaviour
and
then
they
lunch
on
bread
and
cheese
and
apples
and
more
songs
follow
till
she
sends
him
to
get
baldwin
and
walter
and
peronette
and
the
pipers
for
a
dance
in
his
absence
the
chevalier
returns
and
becomes
very
pressing
in
his
attentions
which
gives
her
occasion
to
sing
robin
flagoler
au
flagol
when
robin
enters
the
knight
picks
a
quarrel
with
him
for
not
handling
properly
the
falcon
which
he
has
caught
in
the
hedge
and
robin
gets
a
severe
beating
the
scene
ends
by
the
horseman
carrying
off
marion
by
force
but
he
soon
gets
tired
of
carrying
her
against
her
will
and
drops
her
and
disappears
once
for
all
certes
voirement
sui
je
beste
quant
a
ceste
beste
adieu
bergiere
bete
the
knight
certainly
was
and
was
meant
to
be
in
order
to
give
the
necessary
colour
to
marion
charms
chevaliers
were
seldom
intellectually
brilliant
in
the
mediaeval
romans
and
even
the
chansons
de
geste
liked
better
to
talk
of
their
prowess
than
of
their
wit
but
adam
de
la
halle
who
felt
no
great
love
for
chevaliers
was
not
satisfied
with
ridiculing
them
in
order
to
exalt
marion
his
second
act
was
devoted
to
exalting
marion
at
the
expense
of
her
own
boors
the
first
act
was
given
up
to
song
the
second
to
games
and
dances
the
games
prove
not
to
be
wholly
a
success
marion
is
bored
by
them
and
wants
to
dance
the
dialogue
shows
marion
trying
constantly
to
control
her
clowns
and
make
them
decent
as
blanche
of
castile
had
been
all
her
life
trying
to
control
her
princes
and
mary
of
chartres
her
kings
robin
is
a
rustic
counterpart
to
thibaut
he
is
tamed
by
his
love
of
marion
but
he
has
just
enough
intelligence
to
think
well
of
himself
and
to
get
himself
into
trouble
without
knowing
how
to
get
out
of
it
marion
loves
him
much
as
she
would
her
child
she
makes
only
a
little
fun
of
him
defends
him
from
the
others
laughs
at
his
jealousy
scolds

his

sends
him
on
errands
to
bring

pipers
or
drive
away
the
wolf
and
what
is
most
to
our
purpose
uses
him
to
make
the
other
peasants
decent
walter
and
baldwin
and
hugh
are
coarse
and
their
idea
of
wit
is
to
shock
the
women
or
make
robin
jealous
love
makes
gentlemen
even
of
boors
whether
noble
or
villain
is
the
constant
moral
of
mediaeval
story
and
love
turns
robin
into
a
champion
of
decency
when
at
last
walter
playing
the
jongleur
begins
to
repeat
a
particularly
coarse
fabliau
or
story
in
verse
robin
stops
him

you
a
dirty

a

seems
inevitable
but
marion
turns
it
into

and
the

led
by
the
pipers
with

and
marion
at
the
head
of

in

is
said
to
be
still
known
in
italy
as
the
tresca
marion
is
in
her
way
as
charming
as
nicolette
but
we
are
less
interested
in
her
charm
than
in
her
power
always
the
woman
appears
as
the
practical
guide
the
one
who
keeps
her
head
even
in
love

the
man
never
cared
he
was
always
getting
himself
into
crusades
or
feuds
or
love
or
debt
and
depended
on
the
woman
to
get
him
out
the
story
was
always
of
charles
vii
and
jeanne
or
agnes
sorel
the
woman
might
be
the
good
or
the
evil
spirit
but
she
was
always
the
stronger
force
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
were
a
period
when
men
were
at
their
strongest
never
before
or
since
have
they
shown
equal
energy
in
such
varied
directions
or
such
intelligence
in
the
direction
of
their
energy
yet
these
marvels
of
history
these
plantagenets
these
scholastic
philosophers
these
architects
of
rheims
and
amiens
these
innocents
and
robin
hoods
and
marco
polos
these
crusaders
who
planted
their
enormous
fortresses
all
over
the
levant
these
monks
who
made
the
wastes
and
barrens
yield
harvests
all
without
apparent
exception
bowed
down
before
the
woman
explain
it
who
will
we
are
not
particularly
interested
in
the
explanation
it
is
the
art
we
have
chased
through
this
french
forest
like
aucassins
hunting
for
nicolette
and
the
art
leads
always
to
the
woman
poetry
like
the
architecture
and
the
decoration
harks
back
to
the
same
standard
of
taste
the
specimens
of
christian
of
troyes
thibaut
tristan
aucassins
and
adam
de
la
halle
were
mild
admissions
of
feminine
superiority
compared
with
some
that
were
more
in
vogue
if
thibaut
painted
his
on
the
walls
of
his
castle
he
put
there
only
what
a
more
famous
poet
who
may
have
been
his
friend
set
on
the
walls
of
his
chateau
of
courteous
love
which
not
being
made
with
hands
or
with
stone
but
merely
with
verse
has
not
wholly
perished
the
roman
de
la
rose
is
the
end
of
true
mediaeval
poetry
and
goes
with
the
chapelle
in
architecture
and
three
hundred
years
of
more
or
less
graceful
imitation
or
variation
on
the
same
themes
which
followed
our
age
calls
it
false
taste
and
no
doubt
our
age
is
right
every
age
is
right
by
its
own
standards
as
long
as
its
standards
amuse
it
but
after
all
the
roman
de
la
rose
charmed
chaucer
it
may
well
charm
you
the
charm
may
not
be
that
of
or
of
roland
it
has
not
the
grand
manner
of
the
eleventh
century
or
the
jewelled
brilliancy
of
the
chartres
lancets
or
the
splendid
assertion
of
the
roses
but
even
to
this
day
it
gives
out
a
faint
odour
of
champagne
and
touraine
of
provence
and
cyprus
one
hears
thibaut
and
sees
queen
blanche
of
course
this
odour
of
true
sanctity
belongs
only
to
the
roman
of
william
of
lorris
which
dates
from
the
death
of
queen
blanche
and
of
all
good
things
about
a
short
allegory
of
courteous
love
in
hundred
and
seventy
lines
to
modern
taste
an
allegory
of
hundred
and
seventy
lines
seems
to
be
not
so
short
as
it
might
be
but
the
fourteenth
century
found
five
thousand
verses
totally
inadequate
to
the
subject
and
about
jean
de
meung
added
eighteen
thousand
lines
the
favourite
reading
of
society
for
one
or
two
hundred
years
but
beyond
our
horizon
the
roman
of
william
of
lorris
was
complete
in
itself
it
had
shape
beginning
middle
and
end
even
a
certain
realism
action
almost
life
the
rose
is
any
feminine
ideal
of
beauty
intelligence
purity
or
grace
always
culminating
in
the
virgin
but
the
scene
is
the
court
of
love
and
the
action
is
avowedly
in
a
dream
without
time
or
place
the
poet
tone
is
very
pure
a
little
subdued
at
times
sad
and
the
poem
ends
sadly
but
all
the
figures
that
were
positively
hideous
were
shut
out
of
the
court
and
painted
on
the
outside
walls
hatred
felony
covetousness
envy
poverty
melancholy
and
old
age
death
did
not
appear
the
passion
for
representing
death
in
its
horrors
did
not
belong
to
the
sunny
atmosphere
of
the
thirteenth
century
and
indeed
jarred
on
french
taste
always
though
the
church
came
to
insist
on
it
but
old
age
gave
the
poet
a
motive
more
artistic
foreshadowing
death
and
quite
sad
enough
to
supply
the
necessary
contrast
the
poet
who
approached
the
walls
of
the
chateau
and
saw
outside
all
the
unpleasant
facts
of
life
conspicuously
posted
up
as
though
to
shut
them
out
of
doors
hastened
to
ask
for
entrance
and
when
once
admitted
found
a
court
of
ideals
their
names
matter
little
in
the
mind
of
william
of
lorris
every
one
would
people
his
ideal
world
with
whatever
ideal
figures
pleased
him
and
the
only
personal
value
of
figures
is
that
they
represent
what
he
thought
the
century
ideals
of
a
perfect
society

the
note
of
sadness
has
begun
which
the

were
to
find
so
much
more
to

taste

the
note
of
gladness
from
the

was
a

william

was
first
to
see
it
and
say
it
with
more
sadness
and
less
bitterness
than
villon
showed
he
won
immortality
by
telling
how
he
and
the
thirteenth
century
in
him
had
lost
himself
in
pursuing
his
rose
and
how
he
had
lost
the
rose

up
at

the
dull

not

the

whatever

possibly
in

but
her
power
has
limits
if
not
her

the
whole

with

had
not
the
power
to
pardon
him
who
should
translate
dante
and
petrarch
the
prayers
come
in
here
not
merely
for
their
beauty
although
the
virgin
knows
how
beautiful
they
are
whether
man
knows
it
or
not
but
chiefly
to
show
the
good
faith
the
depth
of
feeling
the
intensity
of
conviction
with
which
society
adored
its
ideal
of
human
perfection
the
virgin
filled
so
enormous
a
space
in
the
life
and
thought
of
the
time
that
one
stands
now
helpless
before
the
mass
of
testimony
to
her
direct
action
and
constant
presence
in
every
moment
and
form
of
the
illusion
which
men
thought
they
thought
their
existence
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
believed
in
the
supernatural
and
might
almost
be
said
to
have
contracted
a
as
morbid
as
any
other
form
of
artificial
stimulant
they
stood
like
children
in
an
attitude
of
gaping
wonder
before
the
miracle
of
miracles
which
they
felt
in
their
own
consciousness
but
one
can
see
in
this
emotion
which
is
after
all
not
exclusively
infantile
no
special
reason
why
they
should
have
so
passionately
flung
themselves
at
the
feet
of
the
woman
rather
than
of
the
man
dante
wrote
in
after
the
height
of
this
emotion
had
passed
and
petrarch
wrote
half
a
century
later
still
but
so
slowly
did
the
vision
fade
and
so
often
did
it
revive
that
to
this
day
it
remains
the
strongest
symbol
with
which
the
church
can
conjure
men
were
after
all
not
wholly
inconsequent
their
attachment
to
mary
rested
on
an
instinct
of
they
knew
their
own
peril
if
there
was
to
be
a
future
life
mary
was
their
only
hope
she
alone
represented
love
the
trinity
were
or
was
one
and
could
by
the
nature
of
its
essence
administer
justice
alone
only
childlike
illusion
could
expect
a
personal
favour
from
christ
turn
the
dogma
as
one
would
to
this
it
must
logically
come
call
the
three
godheads
by
what
names
one
liked
still
they
must
remain
one
must
administer
one
justice
must
admit
only
one
law
in
that
law
no
human
weakness
or
error
could
exist
by
its
essence
it
was
infinite
eternal
immutable
there
was
no
crack
and
no
cranny
in
the
system
through
which
human
frailty
could
hope
for
escape
one
was
forced
from
corner
to
corner
by
a
remorseless
logic
until
one
fell
helpless
at
mary
feet
without
mary
man
had
no
hope
except
in
atheism
and
for
atheism
the
world
was
not
ready
hemmed
back
on
that
side
men
rushed
like
sheep
to
escape
the
butcher
and
were
driven
to
mary
only
too
happy
in
finding
protection
and
hope
in
a
being
who
could
understand
the
language
they
talked
and
the
excuses
they
had
to
offer
how
passionately
they
worshipped
mary
the
cathedral
of
chartres
shows
and
how
this
worship
elevated
the
whole
sex
all
the
literature
and
history
of
the
time
proclaim
if
you
need
more
proof
you
can
read
more
petrarch
but
still
one
can
not
realize
how
actual
mary
was
to
the
men
and
women
of
the
middle
ages
and
how
she
was
present
as
a
matter
of
course
whether
by
way
of
miracle
or
as
a
habit
of
life
throughout
their
daily
existence
the
surest
measure
of
her
reality
is
the
enormous
money
value
they
put
on
her
assistance
and
the
art
that
was
lavished
on
her
gratification
but
an
almost
equally
certain
sign
is
the
casual
allusion
the
chance
reference
to
her
which
assumes
her
presence
the
earliest
prose
writer
in
the
french
language
who
gave
a
picture
of
actual
french
life
was
joinville
and
although
he
wrote
after
the
death
of
saint
louis
and
of
william
of
lorris
and
adam
de
la
halle
in
the
full
decadence
of
philip
the
fair
toward
he
had
been
a
vassal
of
thibaut
and
an
intimate
friend
of
louis
and
his
memories
went
back
to
the
france
of
blanche
regency
born
in
he
must
have
seen
in
his
youth
the
struggles
of
thibaut
against
the
enemies
of
blanche
and
in
fact
his
memoirs
contain
emphatic
letter
forbidding
thibaut
to
marry
yolande
of
brittany
he
knew
pierre
de
dreux
well
and
when
they
were
captured
by
the
saracens
at
damietta
and
thrown
into
the
hold
of
a
galley
i
had
my
feet
right
on
the
face
of
the
count
pierre
de
bretagne
whose
feet
in
turn
were
by
my
face
joinville
is
almost
in
feeling
he
was
neither
feminine
nor
sceptical
but
simple
he
showed
no
concern
for
poetry
but
he
put
up
a
glass
window
to
the
virgin
his
religion
belonged
to
the
chanson
de
roland
when
saint
louis
who
had
a
pleasant
sense
of
humour
put
to
him
his
favourite
religious
conundrums
joinville
affected
not
the
least
hypocrisy
would
you
rather
be
a
leper
or
commit
a
mortal
sin
asked
the
king
i
would
rather
commit
thirty
mortal
sins
than
be
a
leper
answered
joinville
do
you
wash
the
feet
of
the
poor
on
holy
thursday
asked
the
king
god
forbid
replied
joinville
never
will
i
wash
the
feet
of
such
creatures
saint
louis
mildly
corrected
his
or
rather
thibaut
seneschal
for
these
impieties
but
he
was
no
doubt
used
to
them
for
the
soldier
was
never
a
churchman
if
one
asks
joinville
what
he
thinks
of
the
virgin
he
answers
with
the
same
frankness

at

for
a
time
society
held
firm
the
thirteenth
century
could
not
afford
to
admit
a

society
had
staked
its

on
the
reality

its
whole
capital
spiritual

even
to
the
bulk
of
its
real

and
her
overthrow
would
have
been
the
most
appalling
disaster
the
western
world
had
ever
known
without
her
the

could
not
stand
the

fall
the

even

with
a
calamity
so
serious
for
that
had
created
not
destroyed
a
faith
if
sceptics
there
were
they
kept

doubted
about

about
the

in

spirit

violent
disputes
on

the

united
in
devotion
to

it
was
the
single
redeeming
quality
about
them
the
monarchs
believed
almost
more
implicitly
than
their
subjects
and
maintained
the
belief
to
the
last
doubtless
the
death
of

marked
the
at
its
height

an
authority
so

the
weirdest
most
fascinating
most
repulsive
most
pathetic
and
most
pitiable
of
the
whole
picturesque
series
of
french
kings
if
you
look
into
the
journal
of
pierre
de
under
date
of
january
you
can
read
the
entry
the
king
and
the
queen
louise
de
lorraine
separately
and
each
accompanied
by
a
good
troop
of
companions
went
on
foot
from
paris
to
chartres
on
a
pilgrimage
voyage
to
our
lady
of
the
crypt
where
a
neuvaine
was
celebrated
at
the
last
mass
at
which
the
king
and
queen
assisted
and
offered
a
statue
of
notre
dame
which
weighed
a
hundred
marks
eight
hundred
ounces
with
the
object
of
having
lineage
which
might
succeed
to
the
throne
in
the
dead
of
winter
in
robes
of
penitents
over
the
roughest
roads
on
foot
the
king
and
queen
then
seven
years
married
walked
fifty
miles
to
chartres
to
supplicate
the
virgin
for
children
and
back
again
and
this
they
did
year
after
year
until
jacques
clement
put
an
end
to
it
with
his
dagger
in
although
the
virgin
never
chose
to
perform
that
miracle
but
instead
allowed
the
house
of
valois
to
die
out
and
sat
on
her
throne
in
patience
while
the
house
of
bourbon
was
anointed
in
their
place
the
only
french
king
ever
crowned
in
the
presence
of
our
lady
of
chartres
was
henry
iv
a
heretic
the
year
which
was
so
decisive
for
henry
iv
in
france
marked
in
england
the
rise
of
shakespeare
as
a
sort
of
while
in
france
the
virgin
still
held
such
power
that
kings
and
queens
asked
her
for
favours
almost
as
instinctively
as
they
had
done
five
hundred
years
before
in
england
shakespeare
set
all
human
nature
and
all
human
history
on
the
stage
with
hardly
an
allusion
to
the
virgin
name
unless
as
an
oath
the
exceptions
are
worth
noting
as
a
matter
of
curious
shakespearean
criticism
for
they
are
but
two
and
both
are
lines
in
the
first
part
of
henry
vi
spoken
by
the
maid
of
orleans
christ
mother
helps
me
else
i
were
too
weak
whether
the
first
part
of
henry
vi
was
written
by
shakespeare
at
all
has
been
a
doubt
much
discussed
and
too
deep
for
tourists
but
that
this
line
was
written
by
a
roman
catholic
is
the
more
likely
because
no
such
religious
thought
recurs
in
all
the
rest
of
shakespeare
works
dramatic
or
lyric
unless
it
is
implied
in
gaunt
allusion
to
the
world
ransom
blessed
mary
son
thus
while
three
hundred
years
caused
in
england
the
disappearance
of
the
great
divinity
on
whom
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
had
lavished
all
their
hopes
and
during
these
three
centuries
every
earthly
throne
had
been
repeatedly
shaken
or
shattered
the
church
had
been
broken
in
halves
faith
had
been
lost
and
philosophies
overthrown
the
virgin
still
remained
and
remains
the
most
intensely
and
the
most
widely
and
the
most
personally
felt
of
all
characters
divine
or
human
or
imaginary
that
ever
existed
among
men
nothing
has
even
remotely
taken
her
place
the
only
possible
exception
is
the
buddha
sakya
muni
but
to
the
western
mind
a
figure
like
the
buddha
stood
much
farther
away
than
the
virgin
that
of
the
christ
even
to
saint
bernard
stood
not
so
near
as
that
of
his
mother
abelard
expressed
the
fact
in
its
logical
necessity
even
more
strongly
than
saint

ruthless

the

a
stronger
word
than
one
would
like
to
use
now
with
a
priest

hearing
we
need
not
insist
on
it
but
what
one
must
insist
on
is
the
good
faith
of
the
whole
people
kings
queens
princes
of
all
sorts
philosophers
poets
soldiers
artists
as
well
as
of
the
commoners
like
ourselves
and
the
poor
for
the
good
faith
of
the
priests
is
not
important
to
the
understanding
since
any
class
which
is
sufficiently
interested
in
believing
will
always
believe
in
order
to
feel
gothic
architecture
in
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
one
must
feel
first
and
last
around
and
above
and
beneath
it
the
good
faith
of
the
public
excepting
only
jews
and
atheists
permeating
every
portion
of
it
with
the
conviction
of
an
immediate
alternative
between
heaven
and
hell
with
mary
as
the
only
court
in
equity
capable
of
overruling
strict
law
the
virgin
was
a
real
person
whose
tastes
wishes
instincts
passions
were
intimately
known
enough
of
the
virgin
literature
survives
to
show
her
character
and
the
course
of
her
daily
life
we
know
more
about
her
habits
and
thoughts
than
about
those
of
earthly
queens
the
miracles
de
la
vierge
make
a
large
part
and
not
the
poorest
part
of
the
enormous
literature
of
these
two
centuries
although
the
works
of
albertus
magnus
fill
folio
volumes
and
those
of
thomas
aquinas
fill
more
while
the
chansons
de
geste
and
the
romans
published
or
unpublished
are
a
special
branch
of
literature
with

the

made
by
a
priest
of

cathedral
about
separate
series
or
single
tales
have
appeared
and
are
appearing
constantly
but
no
general
collection
has
ever
been
made
although
the
whole
poetic
literature
of
the
virgin
could
be
printed
in
the
space
of
two
or
three
volumes
of
scholastic
philosophy
and
if
the
church
had
cared
half
as
truly
for
the
virgin
as
it
has
for
thomas
aquinas
every
miracle
might
have
been
collected
and
published
a
score
of
times
the
miracles
themselves
indeed
are
not
very
numerous
in
gaultier
de
coincy
collection
they
number
only
about
fifty
the
chartres
collection
relates
chiefly
to
the
horrible
outbreak
of
what
was
called
leprosy
the
mal
ardent
which
ravaged
the
north
of
france
during
the
crusades
and
added
intensity
to
the
feelings
which
brought
all
society
to
the
virgin
feet
recent
scholars
are
cataloguing
and
classifying
the
miracles
as
far
as
they
survive
and
have
reduced
the
number
within
very
moderate
limits
as
poetry
gaultier
de

are
the
best
of
gaultier
de
coincy
and
his
poetry
gaston
paris
has
something
to
say
which
is
worth
quoting
it
is
the
most
curious
and
often
the
most
singular
monument
of
the
infantile
piety
of
the
middle
ages
devotion
to
mary
is
presented
in
it
as
a
kind
of
infallible
guarantee
not
only
against
every
sort
of
evil
but
also
against
the
most
legitimate
consequences
of
sin
and
even
of
crime
in
these
stories
which
have
revolted
the
most
rational
piety
as
well
as
the
philosophy
of
modern
times
one
must
still
admit
a
gentle
and
penetrating
charm
a
naivete
a
tenderness
and
a
simplicity
of
heart
which
touch
while
they
raise
a
smile
there
for
instance
one
sees
a
sick
monk
cured
by
the
milk
that
our
lady
herself
comes
to
invite
him
to
draw
from
her
douce
mamelle
a
robber
who
is
in
the
habit
of
recommending
himself
to
the
virgin
whenever
he
is
going
to
embler
is
held
up
by
her
white
hands
for
three
days
on
the
gibbet
where
he
is
hung
until
the
miracle
becomes
evident
and
procures
his
pardon
an
ignorant
monk
who
knows
only
his
ave
maria
and
is
despised
on
that
account
when
dead
reveals
his
sanctity
by
five
roses
which
come
out
of
his
mouth
in
honour
of
the
five
letters
of
the
name
maria
a
nun
who
has
quitted
her
convent
to
lead
a
life
of
sin
returns
after
long
years
and
finds
that
the
holy
virgin
to
whom
in
spite
of
all
she
has
never
ceased
to
offer
every
day
her
prayer
has
during
all
this
time
filled
her
place
as
sacristine
so
that
no
one
has
perceived
her
absence
gaston
paris
inclined
to
apologize
to
his
bons
bourgeois
de
paris
for
reintroducing
to
them
a
character
so
doubtful
as
the
virgin
mary
but
for
our
studies
the
professor
elementary
morality
is
eloquent
clearly
paris
the
highest
academic
authority
in
the
world
thought
that
the
virgin
could
hardly
in
his
time
say
the
year
be
received
into
good
society
in
the
latin
quarter
our
own
english
ancestors
known
as
puritans
held
the
same
opinion
and
excluded
her
from
their
society
some
four
hundred
years
earlier
for
the
same
reasons
which
affected
gaston
paris
these
reasons
were
just
and
showed
the
respectability
of
the
citizens
who
held
them
in
no
community
under
a
proper
system
of
police
could
the
virgin
feel
at
home
and
the
same
thing
may
be
said
of
most
other
saints
as
well
as
sinners
her
conduct
was
at
times
undignified
as
paris
complained
she
condescended
to
do
domestic
service
in
order
to
help
her
friends
and
she
would
use
her
needle
if
she
were
in
the
mood
for
the
same
object
the
golden
legend
relates
that
a
certain
priest
who
celebrated
every
day
a
mass
in
honour
of
the
holy
virgin
was
brought
up
before
saint
thomas
of
canterbury
who
suspended
him
from
his
charge
judging
him
to
be
and
irresponsible
now
saint
thomas
had
occasion
to
mend
his
shirt
and
while
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
do
so
had
hidden
it
under
his
bed
so
the
virgin
appeared
to
the
priest
and
said
to
him
go
find
the
archbishop
and
tell
him
that
she
for
love
of
whom
you
celebrated
masses
has
herself
mended
his
shirt
for
him
which
is
under
his
bed
and
tell
him
that
she
sends
you
to
him
that
he
may
take
off
the
interdict
he
has
imposed
on
you
and
saint
thomas
found
that
his
shirt
had
in
fact
been
mended
he
relieved
the
priest
begging
him
to
keep
the
secret
of
his
wearing
a
mary
did
some
exceedingly
unconventional
things
and
among
them
the
darning
thomas
and
the
supporting
a
robber
on
the
gibbet
were
not
the
most
singular
yet
they
seem
not
to
have
shocked
queen
blanche
or
saint
francis
or
saint
thomas
aquinas
so
much
as
they
shocked
gaston
paris
and
prudhomme
you
have
still
to
visit
the
cathedral
at
le
mans
for
the
sake
of
its
century
glass
and
there
in
the
lower
panel
of
the
beautiful
and
very
early
window
of
saint
protais
you
will
see
the
figure
of
a
man
lying
in
bed
under
a
handsome
blanket
watching
with
staring
eyes
the
virgin
in
a
green
tunic
wearing
her
royal
crown
who
is
striking
him
on
the
head
with
a
heavy
hammer
and
with
both
hands
the
miracle
belongs
to
local
history
and
is
amusing
only
to
show
how
little
the
virgin
cared
for
criticism
of
her
manners
or
acts
she
was
above
criticism
she
made
manners
her
acts
were
laws
no
one
thought
of
criticizing
in
the
style
of
a
normal
school
the
will
of
such
a
queen
but
one
might
treat
her
with
a
degree
of
familiarity
under
great
provocation
which
would
startle
easier
critics
than
the
french
here
is
an
instance
a
widow
had
an
only
child
whom
she
tenderly
loved
on
hearing
that
this
son
had
been
taken
by
the
enemy
chained
and
put
in
prison
she
burst
into
tears
and
addressing
herself
to
the
virgin
to
whom
she
was
especially
devoted
she
asked
her
with
obstinacy
for
the
release
of
her
son
but
when
she
saw
at
last
that
her
prayers
remained
unanswered
she
went
to
the
church
where
there
was
a
sculptured
image
of
mary
and
there
before
the
image
she
said
holy
virgin
i
have
begged
you
to
deliver
my
son
and
you
have
not
been
willing
to
help
an
unhappy
mother
i
implored
your
patronage
for
my
son
and
you
have
refused
it
very
good
just
as
my
son
has
been
taken
away
from
me
so
i
am
going
to
take
away
yours
and
keep
him
as
a
hostage
saying
this
she
approached
took
the
statue
child
on
the
virgin
breast
carried
it
home
wrapped
it
in
spotless
linen
and
locked
it
up
in
a
box
happy
to
have
such
a
hostage
for
her
son
return
now
the
following
night
the
virgin
appeared
to
the
young
man
opened
his
prison
doors
and
said
tell
your
mother
my
child
to
return
me
my
son
now
that
i
have
returned
hers
the
young
man
came
home
to
his
mother
and
told
her
of
his
miraculous
deliverance
and
she
overjoyed
hastened
to
go
with
the
little
jesus
to
the
virgin
saying
to
her
i
thank
you
heavenly
lady
for
restoring
me
my
child
and
in
return
i
restore
yours
for
the
exactness
of
this
story
in
all
its
details
bishop
james
of
voragio
could
not
have
vouched
nor
did
it
greatly
matter
what
he
could
vouch
for
was
the
relation
of
intimacy
and
confidence
between
his
people
and
the
queen
of
heaven
the
fact
conspicuous
above
all
other
historical
certainties
about
religion
that
the
virgin
was
by
essence
illogical
unreasonable
and
feminine
is
the
only
fact
of
any
ultimate
value
worth
studying
and
starts
a
number
of
questions
that
history
has
shown
itself
clearly
afraid
to
touch
protestant
and
catholic
differ
little
in
that
respect
no
one
has
ventured
to
explain
why
the
virgin
wielded
exclusive
power
over
poor
and
rich
sinners
and
saints
alike
why
were
all
the
protestant
churches
cold
failures
without
her
help
why
could
not
the
holy
ghost
the
spirit
of
love
and
grace
equally
answer
their
prayers
why
was
the
son
powerless
why
was
chartres
cathedral
in
the
thirteenth
century
like
lourdes
the
expression
of
what
is
in
substance
a
separate
religion
why
did
the
gentle
and
gracious
virgin
mother
so
exasperate
the
pilgrim
father
why
was
the
woman
struck
out
of
the
church
and
ignored
in
the
state
these
questions
are
not
antiquarian
or
trifling
in
historical
value
they
tug
at
the
very
of
all
that
makes
whatever
order
is
in
the
cosmos
if
a
unity
exists
in
which
and
toward
which
all
energies
centre
it
must
explain
and
include
duality
diversity
infinity
sex
although
certain
to
be
contradicted
by
every
pious
churchman
a
heretic
must
insist
on
thinking
that
the
mater
dolorosa
was
the
logical
virgin
of
the
church
and
that
the
trinity
would
never
have
raised
her
from
the
foot
of
the
cross
had
not
the
virgin
of
majesty
been
imposed
by
necessity
and
public
unanimity
on
a
creed
which
was
meant
to
be
complete
without
her
the
true
feeling
of
the
church
was
best
expressed
by
the
virgin
herself
in
one
of
her
attested
miracles
a
clerk
trusting
more
in
the
mother
than
in
the
son
never
stopped
repeating
the
angelic
salutation
for
his
only
prayer
once
as
he
said
again
the
maria
the
lord
appeared
to
him
and
said
to
him
mother
thanks
you
much
for
all
the
salutations
that
you
make
her
but
still
you
should
not
forget
to
salute
me
also
tamen
et
me
salutare
memento
the
trinity
feared
absorption
in
her
but
was
compelled
to
accept
and
even
to
invite
her
aid
because
the
trinity
was
a
court
of
strict
law
and
as
in
the
old
customary
law
no
process
of
equity
could
be
introduced
except
by
direct
appeal
to
a
higher
power
she
was
imposed
unanimously
by
all
classes
because
what
man
wanted
most
in
the
middle
ages
was
not
merely
law
or
equity
but
also
and
particularly
favour
strict
justice
either
on
earth
or
in
heaven
was
the
last
thing
that
society
cared
to
face
all
men
were
sinners
and
had
at
least
the
merit
of
feeling
that
if
they
got
their
deserts
not
one
would
escape
worse
than
whipping
the
instinct
of
individuality
went
down
through
all
classes
from
the
count
at
the
top
to
the
jugleors
and
menestreus
at
the
bottom
the
individual
rebelled
against
restraint
society
wanted
to
do
what
it
pleased
all
disliked
the
laws
which
church
and
state
were
trying
to
fasten
on
them
they
longed
for
a
power
above
law
or
above
the
contorted
mass
of
ignorance
and
absurdity
bearing
the
name
of
law
but
the
power
which
they
longed
for
was
not
human
for
humanity
they
knew
to
be
corrupt
and
incompetent
from
the
day
of
adam
creation
to
the
day
of
the
last
judgment
they
were
all
criminals
if
not
they
would
have
had
no
use
for
the
church
and
very
little
for
the
state
but
they
had
at
least
the
merit
of
their
faults
they
knew
what
they
were
and
like
children
they
yearned
for
protection
pardon
and
love
this
was
what
the
trinity
though
omnipotent
could
not
give
whatever
the
heretic
or
mystic
might
try
to
persuade
himself
god
could
not
be
love
god
was
justice
order
unity
perfection
he
could
not
be
human
and
imperfect
nor
could
the
son
or
the
holy
ghost
be
other
than
the
father
the
mother
alone
was
human
imperfect
and
could
love
she
alone
was
favour
duality
diversity
under
any
conceivable
form
of
religion
this
duality
must
find
embodiment
somewhere
and
the
middle
ages
logically
insisted
that
as
it
could
not
be
in
the
trinity
either
separately
or
together
it
must
be
in
the
mother
if
the
trinity
was
in
its
essence
unity
the
mother
alone
could
represent
whatever
was
not
unity
whatever
was
irregular
exceptional
outlawed
and
this
was
the
whole
human
race
the
saints
alone
were
safe
after
they
were
sainted
every
one
else
was
criminal
and
men
differed
so
little
in
degree
of
sin
that
in
mary
eyes
all
were
subjects
for
her
pity
and
help
this
general
rule
of
favour
apart
from
law
or
the
reverse
of
law
was
the
mark
of
mary
activity
in
human
affairs
take
for
an
example
an
entire
class
of
her
miracles
applying
to
the
discipline
of
the
church
a
bishop
ejected
an
ignorant
and
corrupt
priest
from
his
living
as
all
bishops
constantly
had
to
do
the
priest
had
taken
the
precaution
to
make
himself
mary
man
he
had
devoted
himself
to
her
service
and
her
worship
mary
instantly
interfered
just
as
queen
eleanor
or
queen
blanche
would
have
done
most
unreasonably
and
never
was
a
poor
bishop
more
roughly
scolded
by
an
orthodox
queen
moult

very
airily
or
angrily
she
said
to
him

a

caught
the
lofty
trick
of
manner
which
belonged
to
the
great
ladies
of
the
court
and
was
inherited
by
them
even
in

down
to
the
time
of
queen
elizabeth
who
treated
her
bishops
also
like
domestic
servants

the

to
us
the
justice
of
the
rebuke
was
nothing
to
the
point
but
that
a
friend
should
exist
on
earth
or
in
heaven
who
dared
to
browbeat
a
bishop
caused
the
keenest
personal
delight
the
legends
are
clearer
on
this
point
than
on
any
other
the
people
loved
mary
because
she
trampled
on
conventions
not
merely
because
she
could
do
it
but
because
she
liked
to
do
what
shocked
every
authority
her
pity
had
no
limit
one
of
the
chartres
miracles
expresses
the
same
motive
in
language
almost
plainer

and
altogether
worthless

devoted

wish
was
absolute
law
on
earth
as
in

for
her
other
laws
were
not
made
intensely
human
but
always
queen
she
upset
at
her
pleasure

decisions
of
every
court
and
the
orders
of
every
authority
human
or
divine
interfered

in

altered

abolished

annihilated
time
like

queens
she
had
many
of
the
failings
and
prejudices
of
her
humanity
in
spite
of
her
own
origin
she
disliked
jews
and
rarely
neglected
a
chance
to
maltreat
them
she
was
not
in
the
least
a
prude
to
her
sin
was
simply
humanity
and
she
seemed
often
on
the
point
of
defending
her
arbitrary
acts
of
mercy
by
frankly
telling
the
trinity
that
if
the
creator
meant
to
punish
man
he
should
not
have
made
him
the
people
who
always
in
their
hearts
protested
against
bearing
the
responsibility
for
the
creator
arbitrary
creations
delighted
to
see
her
upset
the
law
and
reverse
the
rulings
of
the
trinity
they
idolized
her
for
being
strong
physically
and
in
will
so
that
she
feared
nothing
and
was
as
helpful
to
the
knight
in
the
melee
of
battle
as
to
the
young
mother
in
the
only
character
in
which
they
seemed
slow
to
recognize
mary
was
that
of
bourgeoise
the
bourgeoisie
courted
her
favour
at
great
expense
but
she
seemed
to
be
at
home
on
the
farm
rather
than
in
the
shop
she
had
very
rudimentary
knowledge
indeed
of
the
principles
of
political
economy
as
we
understand
them
and
her
views
on
the
subject
of
or
banking
were
so
feminine
as
to
rouse
in
that
powerful
class
a
vindictive
enmity
which
helped
to
overthrow
her
throne
on
the
other
hand
she
showed
a
marked
weakness
for
chivalry
and
one
of
her
prettiest
and
most
miracles
is
that
of
the
knight
who
heard
mass
while
mary
took
his
place
in
the
lists
it
is
much
too

on
at

despatch
your
prayer
let
us
be
off
to
our
affair
the
accent
of
truth
still
lingers
in
this
remonstrance
of
the
squire
who
must
from
all
time
have
lost
his
temper
on
finding
his
chevalier
addicted
to
papelardie
when
he
should
have
been
fighting
but
the
priest
had
the
advantage
of
telling
the
story
and
pointing
the
moral
this
advantage
the
priest
neglected
rarely
but
in
this
case
he
used
it
with
such
refinement
and
so
much
literary
skill
that
even
the
squire
might
have
been
patient
with
the
invariable
gentle
courtesy
of
the
true
knight
the
chevalier
replied
only
by
soft
words

in
one
of
milton
sonnets
is
a
famous
line
which
is
commonly
classed
among
the
noblest
verses
of
the
english
language
they
also
serve
who
only
stand
and
wait
fine
as
it
is
with
the
simplicity
of
the
grand
style
like
the
chanson

the
verse
of
milton
does
not
quite
destroy
the
charm
of
diction
friend
said
to
him
the
chevalier
he
tourneys
very
nobly
too
who
only

through
no

the
verses
lack
the
singular
power
of
the
eleventh
century
it
is
not
worth
while
to
pretend
that
any
verse
written
in
the
thirteenth
century
wholly
holds
its
own
against
roland

the
courtesy
of
roland
has
the
serious
solidity
of
the
romanesque
arch
and
that
of
lancelot
and
aucassins
has
the
grace
of
a
legendary
window
but
one
may
love
it
all
the
same
and
one
may
even
love
the
knight
papelard
though
he
were
as
he
turned
back
to
the
altar
and
remained
in
prayer
until
the
last
mass
was
ended
then
they
mounted
and
rode
on
toward
the
field
and
of
course
you
foresee
what
had
happened
in
itself
the
story
is
bald
enough
but
it
is
told
with
such
skill
that
one
never
tires
of
it
as
the
chevalier
and
the
squire
approached
the
lists
they
met
the
other
knights
returning
for
the
jousts
were
over
but
to
the
astonishment
of
the
chevalier
he
was
greeted
by
all
who
passed
him
with
shouts
of
applause
for
his
marvellous
triumph
in
the
lists
where
he
had
taken
all
the
prizes
and
all
the
prisoners

his
friends
returning
from
the
fight
on
the
way
there
met
the
knight
for
the
jousts
were
wholly
run
and
all
the
prizes
had
been
won
by
the
knight
who
had
not
stirred
from
the
masses
he
had
heard
all
the
knights
as
they
came
by
saluted
him
and
gave
him
joy
and
frankly
said
that
never
yet
had
any
knight
performed
such
feat
nor
ever
honour
won
so
great
as
he
had
done
in
arms
that
day
while
many
of
them
stopped
to
say
that
they
all
his
prisoners
were
in
truth
your
prisoners
we
are
we
can
not
but
admit
it
true
taken
we
were
in
arms
by
you
then
the
truth
dawned
on
him
there
and
all
at
once
he
saw
the
light
that
she
by
whom
he
stood
in
prayer
the
virgin
stood
by
him
in
fight
the
moral
of
the
tale
belongs
to
the
best
feudal
times
the
knight
at
once
recognized
that
he
had
become
the
of
the
queen
and
henceforth
must
render
his
service
entirely
to
her
so
he
called
his
barons
or
tenants
together
and
after
telling
them
what
had
happened
took
leave
of
them
and

never

the

before

who
knows
the

knight
from
the

and
gives
to
each
his
final
place
then
piteously
he
takes
his
leave
while
in
tears
his
barons
grieve
so
he
parts
and
in
an
abbey
serves
henceforth
the
virgin
mary
observe
that
in
this
case
mary
exacted
no
service
usually
the
legends
are
told
as
in
this
instance
by
priests
though
they
were
told
in
the
same
spirit
by
laymen
as
you
can
see
in
the
poems
of
rutebeuf
and
they
would
not
have
been
told
very
differently
by
soldiers
if
one
may
judge
from
joinville
but
commonly
the
virgin
herself
prescribed
the
kind
of
service
she
wished
especially
to
the
young
knight
who
had
of
his
own
accord
chosen
her
for
his
liege
she
showed
herself
as
exacting
as
other
great
ladies
showed
themselves
toward
their
lancelots
and
tristans
when
she
chose
she
could
even
indulge
in
more
or
less
coquetry
else
she
could
never
have
appealed
to
the
sympathies
of
the
errant
one
of
her
miracles
told
how
she
disciplined
the
young
men
who
were
too
much
in
the
habit
of
assuming
her
service
in
order
to
obtain
selfish
objects
a
youthful
chevalier
much
given
to
tournaments
and
the
other
worldly
diversions
of
the
siecle
fell
in
love
after
the
rigorous
obligation
of
his
class
as
you
know
from
your
dulcinea
del
toboso
with
a
lady
who
as
was
also
prescribed
by
the
rules
of
courteous
love
declined
to
listen
to
him
an
abbot
of
his
acquaintance
sympathizing
with
his
distress
suggested
to
him
the
happy
idea
of
appealing
for
help
to
the
queen
of
heaven
he
followed
the
advice
and
for
an
entire
year
shut
himself
up
and
prayed
to
mary
in
her
chapel
that
she
would
soften
the
heart
of
his
beloved
and
bring
her
to
listen
to
his
prayer
at
the
end
of
the
twelvemonth
fixed
as
a
natural
and
sufficient
proof
of
his
earnestness
in
devotion
he
felt
himself
entitled
to
indulge
again
in
innocent
worldly
pleasures
and
on
the
first
morning
after
his
release
he
started
out
on
horseback
for
a
day
hunting
probably
thousands
of
young
knights
and
squires
were
always
doing
more
or
less
the
same
thing
and
it
was
quite
usual
that
as
they
rode
through
the
fields
or
forests
they
should
happen
on
a
solitary
chapel
or
shrine
as
this
knight
did
he
stopped
long
enough
to
kneel
in
it
and
renew
his
prayer
to
the
queen

she

full
of

darting

flashing
flames
till
the
eye

lost
its
sight
in
the
keenness
of
the

as

the

scared
by

the
knight
knows
not
what
to

he
clasps
his
hands
before
his
face
and
in
his
shame
and
his
disgrace
falls
prostrate
on
the

with
fear

with

of

two

your

be
one
is
at
a
loss
to
imagine
what
a
young
gentleman
could
do
in
such
a
situation
except
to
obey
with
the
fewest
words
possible
the
suggestion
so
gracefully
intended
queen
favours
might
be
fatal
gifts
but
they
were
much
more
fatal
to
reject
than
to
accept
whatever
might
be
the
preferences
of
the
knight
he
had
invited
his
own
fate
and
in
consequence
was
fortunate
to
be
allowed
the
option
of
dying
and
going
to
heaven
or
dying
without
going
to
heaven
mary
was
not
always
so
gentle
with
young
men
who
deserted
or
neglected
her
for
an
earthly
rival
the
offence
which
irritated
her
most
and
occasionally
caused
her
to
use
language
which
hardly
bears
translation
into
modern
english
without
meaning
to
assert
that
the
queen
of
heaven
was
jealous
as
queen
blanche
herself
one
must
still
admit
that
she
was
very
severe
on
lovers
who
showed
willingness
to
leave
her
service
and
take
service
with
any
other
lady
one
of
her
admirers
educated
for
the
priesthood
but
not
yet
in
full
orders
was
obliged
by
reasons
of
family
interest
to
quit
his
career
in
order
to
marry
an
insult
like
this
was
more
than
mary
could
endure
and
she
gave
the
young
man
a
lesson
he
never
forgot

be
gainsaid
no
earthly
love
had
a
chance
of
holding
its
own
against
this
unfair
combination
of
heaven
and

and
mary
was
as
unscrupulous
as
any
other
great
lady
in
abusing
all
her
advantages
in
order
to
save
her
souls
frenchmen
never
found
fault
with
abuses
of
power
for
what
they
thought
a
serious
object
the
more
tyrannical
mary
was
the
more
her
adorers
adored
and
they
wholly
approved
both
in
love
and
in
law
the
rule
that
any
man
who
changed
his
allegiance
without
permission
did
so
at
his
own
peril
his
life
and
property
were
forfeit
mary
showed
him
too
much
grace
in
giving
him
an
option
even
in
anger
mary
always
remained
a
great
lady
and
in
the
ordinary
relations
of
society
her
manners
were
exquisite
as
they
were
according
to
joinville
in
the
court
of
saint
louis
when
tempers
were
not
overwrought
the
very
brutality
of
the
brutal
compelled
the
courteous
to
exaggerate
courtesy
and
some
of
the
royal
family
were
as
coarse
as
the
king
was
delicate
in
manners
in
heaven
the
manners
were
perfect
and
almost
as
stately
as
those
of
roland
and
oliver
on
one
occasion
saint
peter
found
himself
embarrassed
by
an
affair
which
the
public
opinion
of
the
court
of
heaven
although
not
by
any
means
puritanic
thought
more
objectionable
in
fact
more
frankly
discreditable
than
an
honest
corrupt
job
ought
to
be
and
even
his
influence
though
certainly
considerable
wholly
failed
to
carry
it
through
the
the
case
as
reported
by
gaultier
de
coincy
was
this
a
very
worthless
creature
of
saint
peter
a
monk
of
cologne
who
had
led
a
scandalous
life
and
ne
cremoit
dieu
ordre
ne
roule
died
and
in
due
course
of
law
was
tried
convicted
and
dragged
off
by
the
devils
to
undergo
his
term
of
punishment
saint
peter
could
not
desert
his
sinner
though
much
ashamed
of
him
and
accordingly
made
formal
application
to
the
trinity
for
a
pardon
the
trinity
somewhat
severely
refused
finding
his
own
interest
insufficient
saint
peter
tried
to
strengthen
it
by
asking
the
archangels
to
help
him
but
the
case
was
too
much
for
them
also
and
they
declined
the
brother
apostles
were
appealed
to
with
the
same
result
and
finally
even
the
saints
though
they
had
so
obvious
interest
in
keeping
friendly
relations
with
peter
found
public
opinion
too
strong
to
defy
the
case
was
desperate
the
trinity
were
or
was
emphatic
and
what
was
rare
in
the
middle
ages
every
member
of
the
feudal
hierarchy
sustained
its
decision
nothing
more
could
be
done
in
the
regular
way
saint
peter
was
obliged
to
divest
himself
of
authority
and
place
himself
and
his
dignity
in
the
hands
of
the
virgin
accordingly
he
asked
for
an
audience
and
stated
the
case
to
our
lady
with
the
utmost
grace
she
instantly
responded

then
arose
straightway
and
sought
her

without
delay
all
her

followed
her
and
saint
peter
kept
him
near
for
he
knew
his
task
was
done
and
his
prize
already
won
since
it
was
hers
in
whom
began
the
life
of
god
in
form
of
man
when
our
dear
lord
who
deigned
to
write
with
his
own
hand
that
in
his
sight
those
in
his
kingdom
held
most
dear
father
and
mother
honoured
here
when
he
saw
his

face
he
rose
and
said
with
gentle
grace
well
are
you
come
my
heart
desire
like
loving
son
like
gracious
sire
took
her
hand
gently
in
his
own
gently
placed
her
on
his
throne
wishing
her
graciously
good
cheer
what
brings
my
gentle
mother
here
my
sister
and
my
dearest
friend
one
can
see
queen
blanche
going
to
beg
or
command
a
favour
of
her
son
king
louis
and
the
stately
dignity
of
their
address
while
saint
peter
and
the
virgins
remain
in
the
antechamber
but
as
for
saint
peter
lost
soul
the
request
was
a
mere
form
and
the
doors
of
paradise
were
instantly
opened
to
it
after
such
brief
formalities
as
should
tend
to
preserve
the
technical
record
of
the
we
tread
here
on
very
delicate
ground
gaultier
de
coincy
being
a
priest
and
a
prior
could
take
liberties
which
we
can
not
or
ought
not
to
take
the
doctrines
of
the
church
are
too
serious
and
too
ancient
to
be
wilfully
misstated
and
the
doctrines
of
what
is
called
mariolatry
were
never
even
doctrines
of
the
church
yet
it
is
true
that
in
the
hearts
of
mary
servants
the
church
and
its
doctrines
were
at
the
mercy
of
mary
will
gaultier
de
coincy
claimed
that
mary
exasperated
the
devils
by
exercising
a
wholly
arbitrary
and
illegitimate
power
gaultier
not
merely
admitted
but
frankly
asserted
that
this
was
the
fact

in
this
say
the
devils
since
it
is
a
choice
of
evils
we
had
best
appeal
on
high
to
the
judge
who
does
not
lie
what
is
law
to
any
other
is
no
use
pleading
with
his
mother
but
god
judges
us
so
true
that
he
leaves
us
all
our
due
his
mother
judges
us
so
short
that
she
throws
us
out
of
court
when
we
ought
to
win
our
cause
in
heaven
and
earth
she
makes
more
laws
by
far
than
god
himself
can
do
he
loves
her
so
and
trusts
her
so
there
nothing
she
can
do
or
say
that
he
refuse
or
say
her
nay
whatever
she
may
want
is
right
though
she
say
that
black
is
white
and
dirty
water
clear
as
snow
my
mother
says
it
and
it
so
if
the
virgin
took
the
feelings
of
the
trinity
into
consideration
or
recognized
its
existence
except
as
her
son
the
case
has
not
been
reported
or
at
all
events
has
been
somewhat
carefully
kept
out
of
sight
by
the
virgin
poets
the
devils
were
emphatic
in
denouncing
mary
for
absorbing
the
whole
trinity
in
one
sharply
disputed
case
in
regard
to
a
villain
or
labourer
whose
soul
the
virgin
claimed
because
he
had
learned
the
ave
maria
the
devils
became
very
angry
indeed
and
protested
vehemently

the
ugly

laugh
outright
and
grind
their
teeth
with
envious
spite
crying
marvel
marvellous
because
that
ploughman
there
learned
to
make
your

a
prayer
she
would
like
to
kill
us
all
just
for
looking
toward
his
soul
all
the
world
she
wants
to
rule
no
such
dame
was
ever
seen
she
thinks
that
she
is
god
i
ween
or
holds
him
in
her
hollow
hand
not
a
judgment
or
command
or
an
order
can
be
given
here
on
earth
or
there
in
heaven
that
she
does
not
want
control
she
thinks
that
she
ordains
the
whole
and
keeps
it
all
for
her
own
profit
god
nor

share
not
of
it
as
regards
mary
of

these
charges
seem
to
have
been
literally
true
except
so
far
as
concerned
the
laid
maufe
pierre
de
dreux
gaultier
de
coincy
saw
no
impropriety
in
accepting
as
sufficiently
exact
the
allegations
of
the
devils
against
the
virgin
abuse
of
power
down
to
the
death
of
queen
blanche
which
is
all
that
concerns
us
the
public
saw
no
more
impropriety
in
it
than
gaultier
did
the
ugly
envious
devils
notorious
as
students
of
the
latin
quarter
were
perpetually
making
the
same
charges
against
queen
blanche
and
her
son
without
disturbing
her
authority
no
one
could
conceive
that
the
virgin
held
less
influence
in
heaven
than
the
queen
mother
on
earth
nevertheless
there
were
points
in
the
royal
policy
and
conduct
of
mary
which
thoughtful
men
even
then
hesitated
to
approve
the
church
itself
never
liked
to
be
dragged
too
far
under
feminine
influence
although
the
moment
it
discarded
feminine
influence
it
lost
nearly
everything
of
any
value
to
it
or
to
the
world
except
its
philosophy
mary
tastes
were
too
popular
some
of
the
uglier
devils
said
they
were
too
low
many
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
siecle
thought
them
disreputable
though
they
dared
not
say
so
or
dared
say
so
only
by
proxy
as
in
aucassins
as
usual
one
must
go
to
the
devils
for
the
exact
truth
and
in
spite
of
their
outcry
the
devils
admitted
that
they
had
no
reason
to
complain
of
mary

the

true
it
was
although
one
should
not
say
it
jestingly
that
the
virgin
embarrassed
the
trinity
and
perhaps
this
was
the
reason
behind
all
the
other
excellent
reasons
why
men
loved
and
adored
her
with
a
passion
such
as
no
other
deity
has
ever
inspired
and
why
we
although
utter
strangers
to
her
are
not
far
from
getting
down
on
our
knees
and
praying
to
her
still
mary
concentrated
in
herself
the
whole
rebellion
of
man
against
fate
the
whole
protest
against
divine
law
the
whole
contempt
for
human
law
as
its
outcome
the
whole
unutterable
fury
of
human
nature
beating
itself
against
the
walls
of
its
and
suddenly
seized
by
a
hope
that
in
the
virgin
man
had
found
a
door
of
escape
she
was
above
law
she
took
feminine
pleasure
in
turning
hell
into
an
ornament
she
delighted
in
trampling
on
every
social
distinction
in
this
world
and
the
next
she
knew
that
the
universe
was
as
unintelligible
to
her
on
any
theory
of
morals
as
it
was
to
her
worshippers
and
she
felt
like
them
no
sure
conviction
that
it
was
any
more
intelligible
to
the
creator
of
it
to
her
every
suppliant
was
a
universe
in
itself
to
be
judged
apart
on
his
own
merits
by
his
love
for
her
by
no
means
on
his
orthodoxy
or
his
conventional
standing
in
the
church
or
according
to
his
correctness
in
defining
the
nature
of
the
trinity
the
convulsive
hold
which
mary
to
this
day
maintains
over
human
imagination
as
you
can
see
at
lourdes
was
due
much
less
to
her
power
of
saving
soul
or
body
than
to
her
sympathy
with
people
who
suffered
under
law
divine
or
human
justly
or
unjustly
by
accident
or
design
by
decree
of
god
or
by
guile
of
devil
she
cared
not
a
straw
for
conventional
morality
and
she
had
no
notion
of
letting
her
friends
be
punished
to
the
tenth
or
any
other
generation
for
the
sins
of
their
ancestors
or
the
peccadilloes
of
eve
so
mary
filled
heaven
with
a
sort
of
persons
little
to
the
taste
of
any
respectable
society
which
has
trouble
enough
in
making
this
world
decent
and
pay
its
bills
without
having
to
continue
the
effort
in
another
mary
stood
in
a
church
of
her
own
so
independent
that
the
trinity
might
have
perished
without
much
affecting
her
position
but
on
the
other
hand
the
trinity
could
look
on
and
see
her
dethroned
with
almost
a
breath
of
relief
aucassins
and
the
devils
of
gaultier
de
coincy
foresaw
her
danger
mary
treatment
of
respectable
and
people
who
had
no
favours
to
ask
and
were
reasonably
confident
of
getting
to
heaven
by
the
regular
judgment
without
expense
rankled
so
deeply
that
three
hundred
years
later
the
puritan
reformers
were
not
satisfied
with
abolishing
her
but
sought
to
abolish
the
woman
altogether
as
the
cause
of
all
evil
in
heaven
and
on
earth
the
puritans
abandoned
the
new
testament
and
the
virgin
in
order
to
go
back
to
the
beginning
and
renew
the
quarrel
with
eve
this
is
the
affair
not
ours
and
the
women
are
competent
to
settle
it
with
church
or
state
without
help
from
outside
but
honest
tourists
are
seriously
interested
in
putting
the
feeling
back
into
the
dead
architecture
where
it
belongs
mary
was
rarely
harsh
to
any
suppliant
or
servant
and
she
took
no
special
interest
in
humiliating
the
rich
or
the
learned
or
the
wise
for
them
law
was
made
by
them
law
was
administered
and
with
their
doings
mary
never
arbitrarily
interfered
but
occasionally
she
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
intimate
her
opinion
of
the
manner
in
which
the
trinity
allowed
their
the
regular
church
to
be
administered
she
was
a
queen
and
never
for
an
instant
forgot
it
but
she
took
little
thought
about
her
divine
rights
if
she
had
any
and
in
fact
saint
bernard
preferred
her
without
them
while
she
was
scandalized
at
the
greed
of
officials
in
her
son
court
one
day
a
rich
usurer
and
a
very
poor
old
woman
happened
to
be
dying
in
the
same
town
gaultier
de
coincy
did
not
say
as
an
accurate
historian
should
that
he
was
present
nor
did
he
mention
names
or
dates
although
it
was
one
of
his
longest
and
best
stories
mary
never
loved
bankers
and
had
no
reason
for
taking
interest
in
this
one
or
for
doing
him
injury
but
it
happened
that
the
parish
priest
was
summoned
to
both
at
the
same
time
and
neglected
the
old
pauper
in
the
hope
of
securing
a
bequest
for
his
church
from
the
banker
this
was
the
sort
of
fault
that
most
annoyed
mary
in
the
church
of
the
trinity
which
in
her
opinion
was
not
cared
for
as
it
should
be
and
she
felt
it
her
duty
to
intimate
as
much
although
the
priest
refused
to
come
at
the
old
woman
summons
his
young
clerk
who
seems
to
have
acted
as
vicar
though
not
in
orders
took
pity
on
her
and
went
alone
with
the
sacrament
to
her
hut
which
was
the
poorest
of
poor
hovels
even
for
that
age

she
lay
upon

without

there

saw
as
filled
his
mind
with
fear
and
awe

with
a

the

lay

round
and
near
a

sat
so

no

could
dream

light
no

describe
the
sight
then
he
saw
that
next

poor

as
she
gasped
and
strained
for
breath
in
the
agony
of
death
sat
our

bending
low

with

white
as

she
dried

the

in
terror
hesitated
whether
to
turn
and
run
away
but
our
lady
beckoned
him
to
the
bed
while
all
rose
and
kneeled
devoutly
to
the
sacrament
then
she
said
to
the
trembling
clerk
friend
be
not
afraid
but
seat
yourself
to
give

beside
these

on

she

when
it
to
paradise
ascends
no
longer
need
we
here
remain
we
can
go
back
to
heaven
again
we
will
return
before
she
dies
and
take
the
soul
to
paradise
the
rest
of
the
story
concerned
the
usurer
whose
was
of
a
different
character
but
mary
interest
in
of
that
kind
was
small
the
fate
of
the
usurer
mattered
the
less
because
she
knew
too
well
how
easily
the
banker
in
good
credit
could
arrange
with
the
officials
of
the
trinity
to
open
the
doors
of
paradise
for
him
the
administration
of
heaven
was
very
like
the
administration
of
france
the
queen
mother
saw
many
things
of
which
she
could
not
wholly
approve
but
her
nature
was
pity
not
justice
and
she
shut
her
eyes
to
much
that
she
could
not
change
her
miracles
therefore
were
for
the
most
part
mere
evidence
of
her
pity
for
those
who
needed
it
most
and
these
were
rarely
the
people
of
the
siecle
but
more
commonly
the
helpless
every
saint
performed
miracles
and
these
are
standard
not
peculiar
to
any
one
intermediator
and
every
saint
protected
his
own
friends
but
beyond
these
exhibitions
of
power
which
are
more
or
less
common
to
the
whole
hierarchy
below
the
trinity
mary
was
the
mother
of
pity
and
the
only
hope
of
despair
one
might
go
on
for
a
volume
studying
the
character
of
mary
and
the
changes
that
time
made
in
it
from
the
earliest
byzantine
legends
down
to
the
daily
recorded
miracles
at
lourdes
no
character
in
history
has
had
so
long
or
varied
a
development
and
none
so
sympathetic
but
the
greatest
poets
long
ago
plundered
that
mine
of
rich
motives
and
have
stolen
what
was
most
dramatic
for
popular
use
the
virgin
most
famous
early
miracle
seems
to
have
been
that
of
the
monk
theophilus
which
was
what
one
might
call
her
salvation
of
faust
another
byzantine
miracle
was
an
original
version
of
shylock
shakespeare
and
his
fellow
dramatists
plundered
the
church
legends
as
freely
as
their
masters
plundered
the
church
treasuries
yet
left
a
mass
of
dramatic
material
untouched
let
us
pray
the
virgin
that
it
may
remain
untouched
for
although
a
good
miracle
was
in
its
day
worth
much
money
so
much
that
the
rival
shrines
stole
each
other
miracles
without
decency
one
does
not
care
to
see
one
virgin
put
to
making
for
jew
one
and
fifty
million
arithmetical
ancestors
shrink
for
mere
amusement
too
the
miracle
is
worth
reading
of
the
little
jew
child
who
ignorantly
joined
in
the
christian
communion
and
was
thrown
into
a
furnace
by
his
father
in
consequence
but
when
the
furnace
was
opened
the
virgin
appeared
seated
in
the
midst
of
the
flames
with
the
little
child
unharmed
in
her
lap
better
is
that
called
the
tombeor
de
notre
dame
only
recently
printed
told
by
some
unknown
poet
of
the
thirteenth
century
and
told
as
well
as
any
of
gaultier
de
coincy
indeed
the
tombeor
de
notre
dame
has
had
more
success
in
our
time
than
it
ever
had
in
its
own
as
far
as
one
knows
for
it
appeals
to
a
quiet
sense
of
humour
that
pleases
modern
french
taste
as
much
as
it
pleased
the
virgin
one
fears
only
to
spoil
it
by
translation
but
if
a
translation
be
merely
used
as
a
glossary
or
footnote
it
need
not
do
fatal
harm
the
story
is
that
of
a
tumbler
tombeor
who
was
disgusted
with
the
world
as
his
class
has
had
a
reputation
for
becoming
and
who
was
fortunate
enough
to
obtain
admission
into
the
famous
monastery
of
clairvaux
where
saint
bernard
may
have
formerly
been
blessed
by
the
virgin
presence
ignorant
at
best
and
especially
ignorant
of
letters
music
and
the
offices
of
a
religious
society
he
found
himself
unable
to
join
in
the
services

day
while

hid
in

in

to
soliloquize
before

hopes

had

a

that

i

she

i

god
mother
in
her
church
the
others
serve
to

and

i
will
serve
to
leap
and
spring
then
he
strips
him
of
his
gown
lays
it
on
the
altar
down
but
for
himself
he
takes
good
care
not
to
show
his
body
bare
but
keeps
a
jacket
soft
and
thin
almost
a
shirt
to
tumble
in
clothed
in
this
supple
woof
of
maille
his
strength
and
health
and
form
showed
well
and
when
his
belt
is
buckled
fast
toward
the
virgin
turns
at
last
very
humbly
makes
his
prayer
lady
says
he
to
your
care
i
commit
my
soul
and
frame
gentle
virgin
gentle
dame
do
not
despise
what
i
shall
do
for
i
ask
only
to
please
you
to
serve
you
like
an
honest
man
so
help
me
god
the
best
i
can
i
can
not
chant
nor
can
i
read
but
i
can
show
you
here
instead
all
my
best
tricks
to
make
you
laugh
and
so
shall
be
as
though
a
calf
should
leap
and
jump
before
its
dam
lady
who
never
yet
could
blame
those
who
serve
you
well
and
true
all
that
i
am
i
am
for
you
then
he
begins
to
jump
about
high
and
low
and
in
and
out
straining
hard
with
might
and
main
then
falling
on
his
knees
again
before
the
image
bows
his
face
by
your
pity
by
your
grace
says
he
ha
my
gentle
queen
do
not
despise
my
offering
in
his
earnestness
he
exerted
himself
until
at
the
end
of
his
strength
he
lay
exhausted
and
unconscious
on
the
altar
steps
pleased
with
his
own
exhibition
and
satisfied
that
the
virgin
was
equally
pleased
he
continued
these
devotions
every
day
until
at
last
his
constant
and
singular
absence
from
the
regular
services
attracted
the
curiosity
of
a
monk
who
kept
watch
on
him
and
reported
his
eccentric
exercise
to
the
abbot
the
mediaeval
monasteries
seem
to
have
been
gently
administered
indeed
this
has
been
made
the
chief
reproach
on
them
and
the
excuse
for
robbing
them
for
the
benefit
of
a
more
energetic
crown
and
nobility
who
tolerated
no
beggars
or
idleness
but
their
own
at
least
it
is
safe
to
say
that
few
and
economically
administered
modern
charities
would
have
the
patience
of
the
abbot
of
clairvaux
who
instead
of
calling
up
the
tombeor
and
sending
him
back
to
the
world
to
earn
a
living
by
his
profession
went
with
his
informant
to
the
crypt
to
see
for
himself
what
the
strange
report
meant
we
have
seen
at
chartres
what
a
crypt
may
be
and
how
easily
one
might
hide
in
its
shadows
while
mass
is
said
at
the
altars
the
abbot
and
his
informant
hid
themselves
behind
a
column
in
the
shadow
and
watched
the
whole
performance
to
its
end
when
the
exhausted
tumbler
dropped
unconscious
and
drenched
with
perspiration
on
the
steps
of
the
altar
with
the
words
dame
fait
il
ne
puis
plus
ore
mais
voire
je
reviendrai
encore
lady
says
he
no
more
i
can
but
truly
i
come
back
again
you
can
imagine
the
dim
crypt
the
tumbler
lying
unconscious
beneath
the
image
of
the
virgin
the
abbot
peering
out
from
the
shadow
of
the
column
and
wondering
what
sort
of
discipline
he
could
inflict
for
this
unforeseen
infraction
of
rule
when
suddenly
before
he
could
decide
what
next
to
do
the
vault
above
the
altar
of
its
own
accord
opened

the
abbot
strains
his
eyes
to
see
and
from
the
vaulting
suddenly
a
lady
steps
so
glorious
beyond
all
thought
so
precious
her
robes
so
rich
so
nobly
worn
so
rare
the
gems
the
robes
adorn
as
never

so
fair
was
born
along
with
her
the
angels
were
archangels
stood
beside
her
there
round
about
the
tumbler
group
to
give
him
solace
bring
him
hope
and
when
round
him
in
ranks
they
stood
his
whole
heart
felt
its
strength
renewed
so
they
haste
to
give
him
aid
because
their
wills
are
only
made
to
serve
the
service
of
their
queen
most
precious
gem
the
earth
has
seen
and
the
lady
gentle
true
holds
in
her
hand
a

him
with
her
hand

he
lies
before

the
kind

full
of

fans
his
neck
his
breast
his

fans
him
herself
to
give
him
air
labours
herself

him
there
the
lady
gives
herself
to
it
the
poor
man
takes
no
heed
of
it
for
he
knows
not
and
can
not
see
that
he
has
such
fair
company
beyond
this
we

go
if
you
can
not
feel
the
colour
and
quality
the
union
of
naivete
and
art
the
refinement
the
infinite
delicacy
and
tenderness
of
this
little
poem
then
nothing
will
matter
much
to
you
and
if

can
feel
it
you
can

hildebert
was
the
first
poet
of
his
time
no
small
merit
since
he
was
contemporary
with
the
chanson
de
roland
and
the
first
crusade
he
was
also
a
strong
man
since
he
was
able
as
bishop
of
le
mans
to
gain
great
credit
by
maintaining
himself
against
william
the
norman
and
fulk
of
anjou
and
finally
he
was
a
prelate
of
high
authority
he
lived
between
and
supposing
his
verses
to
have
been
written
in
middle
life
toward
the
year
they
may
be
taken
to
represent
the
accepted
doctrine
of
the
church
at
the
time
of
the
first
crusade
they
were
little
more
than
a
versified
form
of
the
latin
of
saint
gregory
the
great
who
wrote
years
before
ipse

aut

atque
ex

interior
sed
unus
idemque
totus
ubique
according
to
saint
gregory
in
the
sixth
century
god
was
one
and
the
same
and
wholly
everywhere
immanent
within
everything
without
everything
above
everything
below
everything
sursum
regens
dear
sum
continens
while
according
to
archbishop
hildebert
in
the
eleventh
century
god
is
overall
things
under
all
things
outside
all
inside
all
within
but
not
enclosed
without
but
not
excluded
above
but
not
raised

but
not
depressed
wholly
above
presiding
wholly
beneath
sustaining
wholly
without
embracing
wholly
within
filling
finally
according
to
benedict
spinoza
another
five
hundred
years
later
still
god
is
a
being
absolutely
infinite
that
is
to
say
a
substance
made
up
of
an
infinity
of
attributes
each
one
of
which
expresses
an
eternal
and
infinite
essence
spinoza
was
the
great
pantheist
whose
name
is
still
a
terror
to
the
orthodox
and
whose
philosophy
is
very
properly
a
horror
to
the
church
and
yet
spinoza
never
wrote
a
line
that
to
the
unguided
student
sounds
more
spinozist
than
the
words
of
saint
gregory
and
archbishop
hildebert
if
god
is
everywhere
wholly
presiding
sustaining
embracing
and
filling
sursum
regens
deorsum
continens
he
is
the
only
possible
energy
and
leaves
no
place
for
human
will
to
act
a
force
which
is
one
and
the
same
and
wholly
everywhere
is
more
spinozist
than
spinoza
and
is
likely
to
be
mistaken
for
frank
pantheism
by
the
large
majority
of
religious
minds
who
must
try
to
understand
it
without
a
theological
course
in
a
jesuit
college
in
the
year
jesuit
colleges
did
not
exist
and
even
the
great
dominican
and
franciscan
schools
were
far
from
sight
in
the
future
but
the
school
of
notre
dame
at
paris
existed
and
taught
the
existence
of
god
much
as
archbishop
hildebert
described
it
the
most
successful
lecturer
was
william
of
champeaux
and
to
any
one
who
ever
heard
of
william
at
all
the
name
instantly
calls
up
the
figure
of
abelard
in
flesh
and
blood
as
he
sang
to
heloise
the
songs
which
he
says
resounded
through
europe
the
twelfth
century
with
all
its
sparkle
would
be
dull
without
abelard
and
heloise
with
infinite
regret
heloise
must
be
left
out
of
the
story
because
she
was
not
a
philosopher
or
a
poet
or
an
artist
but
only
a
frenchwoman
to
the
last
millimetre
of
her
shadow
even
though
one
may
suspect
that
her
famous
letters
to
abelard
are
for
the
most
part
by
no
means
above
scepticism
she
was
by
french
standards
worth
at
least
a
dozen
abelards
if
only
because
she
called
saint
bernard
a
false
apostle
unfortunately
french
standards
by
which
she
must
be
judged
in
our
ignorance
take
for
granted
that
she
philosophized
only
for
the
sake
of
abelard
while
abelard
taught
philosophy
to
her
not
so
much
because
he
believed
in
philosophy
or
in
her
as
because
he
believed
in
himself
to
this
day
abelard
remains
a
problem
as
perplexing
as
he
must
have
been
to
heloise
and
almost
as
fascinating
as
the
west
portal
of
chartres
is
the
door
through
which
one
must
of
necessity
enter
the
gothic
architecture
of
the
thirteenth
century
so
abelard
is
the
portal
of
approach
to
the
gothic
thought
and
philosophy
within
neither
art
nor
thought
has
a
modern
equivalent
only
heloise
like
isolde
unites
the
ages
the
first
crusade
seems
in
perspective
to
have
rilled
the
whole
field
of
vision
in
france
at
the
time
but
in
fact
france
seethed
with
other
emotions
and
while
the
crusaders
set
out
to
scale
heaven
by
force
at
jerusalem
the
monks
who
remained
at
home
undertook
to
scale
heaven
by
prayer
and
by
absorption
of
body
and
soul
in
god
the
cistercian
order
was
founded
in
and
was
joined
in
by
young
bernard
born
in
at
drawing
with
him
or
after
him
so
many
thousands
of
young
men
into
the
of
the
monastery
as
carried
dismay
into
the
hearts
of
half
the
women
of
france
at
the
same
time
that
is
about
or
abelard
came
up
to
paris
from
brittany
with
as
much
faith
in
logic
as
bernard
had
in
prayer
or
godfrey
of
bouillon
in
arms
and
led
an
equal
or
even
a
greater
number
of
combatants
to
the
conquest
of
heaven
by
force
of
pure
reason
none
showed
doubt
hundreds
of
thousands
of
young
men
wandered
from
their
provinces
mostly
to
palestine
largely
to
cloisters
but
also
in
great
numbers
to
paris
and
the
schools
while
few
ever
returned
abelard
had
the
advantage
of
being
not
so
highly
descended
as
albertus
magnus
and
thomas
aquinas
who
were
to
complete
his
work
in
the
thirteenth
century
but
like
bernard
a
gentleman
born
and
bred
he
was
the
eldest
son
of
berenger
sieur
du
pallet
a
chateau
in
brittany
south
of
the
loire
on
the
edge
of
poitou
his
name
was
pierre
du
pallet
although
for
some
unknown
reason
he
called
himself
pierre
abailard
or
abeillard
or
esbaillart
or
beylard
for
the
spelling
was
never
fixed
he
was
born
in
and
when
in
the
young
men
of
his
rank
were
rushing
off
to
the
first
crusade
pierre
a
boy
of
seventeen
threw
himself
with
equal
zeal
into
the
study
of
science
and
giving
up
his
inheritance
or
birthright
at
last
came
to
paris
to
seize
a
position
in
the
schools
the
year
is
supposed
to
have
been
the
paris
of
abelard
time
was
astonishingly
old
so
old
that
hardly
a
stone
of
it
can
be
now
pointed
out
even
the
oldest
of
the
buildings
still
standing
in
that
quarter
and
the
tower
of
the
lycee
henri
iv
are
more
modern
only
the
old
roman
thermae
now
part
of
the
musee
de
cluny
within
the
walls
and
the
abbey
tower
of
outside
in
the
fields
were
standing
in
the
year
politically
paris
was
a
small
provincial
town
before
the
reign
of
who
cleared
its
gates
of
its
nearest
enemies
but
as
a
school
paris
was
even
then
easily
first
students
crowded
into
it
by
thousands
till
the
town
is
said
to
have
contained
more
students
than
citizens
modern
paris
seems
to
have
begun
as
a
university
town
before
it
had
a
university
students
flocked
to
it
from
great
distances
encouraged
and
supported
by
charity
and
stimulated
by
privileges
until
they
took
entire
possession
of
what
is
still
called
the
latin
quarter
from
the
barbarous
latin
they
chattered
and
a
town
more
riotous
drunken
and
vicious
than
it
became
in
the
course
of
time
hardly
existed
even
in
the
middle
ages
in
when
enthusiasm
was
fresh
and
faith
in
science
was
strong
the
great
mass
of
students
came
there
to
study
and
having
no
regular
university
organization
or
buildings
they
thronged
the
cloister
of
notre
dame
not
our
notre
dame
which
dates
only
from
but
the
old
romanesque
cathedral
which
stood
on
the
same
spot
and
there
they
listened
and
retained
what
they
could
remember
for
they
were
not
encouraged
to
take
notes
even
if
they
were
rich
enough
to
buy
notebooks
while
manuscripts
were
far
beyond
their
means
one
valuable
right
the
students
seem
to
have
had
that
of
asking
questions
and
even
of
disputing
with
the
lecturer
provided
they
followed
the
correct
form
of
dialectics
the
lecturer
himself
was
licensed
by
the
bishop
five
thousand
students
are
supposed
to
have
swarmed
about
the
cloister
of
notre
dame
across
the
petit
pont
and
up
the
hill
of
three
thousand
are
said
to
have
paid
fees
to
abelard
in
the
days
of
his
great
vogue
and
they
seem
to
have
attached
themselves
to
their
favourite
master
as
a
champion
to
be
upheld
against
the
world
jealousies
ran
high
and
neither
scholars
nor
masters
shunned
dispute
indeed
the
only
science
they
taught
or
knew
was
the
art
of
dispute
dialectics
rhetoric
grammar
and
dialectics
were
the
regular
branches
of
science
and
bold
students
who
were
not
afraid
of
dabbling
in
forbidden
fields
extended
their
studies
to
mathematics
exercitium
nefarium
according
to
abelard
which
he
professed
to
know
nothing
about
but
which
he
studied
nevertheless
abelard
whether
pupil
or
master
never
held
his
tongue
if
he
could
help
it
for
his
fortune
depended
on
using
it
well
but
he
never
used
it
so
well
in
dialectics
or
theology
as
he
did
toward
the
end
of
his
life
in
writing
a
bit
of
autobiography
so
admirably
told
so
vivid
so
vibrating
with
the
curious
intensity
of
his
generation
that
it
needed
only
to
have
been
written
in
romieu
to
be
the
chief
monument
of
early
french
prose
as
the
western
portal
of
chartres
is
the
chief
monument
of
early
french
sculpture
and
of
about
the
same
date
unfortunately
abelard
was
a
noble
scholar
who
necessarily
wrote
and
talked
latin
even
with
heloise
and
although
the
latin
was
mediaeval
it
is
not
much
the
better
on
that
account
because
in
spite
of
its
quaintness
the
naivetes
of
a
young
language
the
egotism
jealousies
suspicions
boastings
and
lamentations
of
a
childlike
time
take
a
false
air
of
outworn
rome
and
byzantium
although
underneath
the
spirit
lives
i
arrived
at
last
in
paris
where
for
a
long
time
dialectics
had
specially
flourished
under
william
of
champeaux
rightly
reckoned
the
first
of
my
masters
in
that
branch
of
study
i
stayed
some
time
in
his
school
but
though
well
received
at
first
i
soon
got
to
be
an
annoyance
to
him
because
i
persisted
in
refuting
certain
ideas
of
his
and
because
not
being
afraid
to
enter
into
argument
against
him
i
sometimes
got
the
better
this
boldness
too
roused
the
wrath
of
those
fellow
students
who
were
classed
higher
because
i
was
the
youngest
and
the
last
comer
this
was
the
beginning
of
my
series
of
misfortunes
which
still
last
my
renown
every
day
increasing
envy
was
kindled
against
me
in
every
direction
this
picture
of
the
boy
of
twenty
harassing
the
professor
day
after
day
in
his
own
before
hundreds
of
older
students
paints
abelard
to
the
life
but
one
may
safely
add
a
few
touches
that
heighten
the
effect
as
that
william
of
champeaux
himself
was
barely
thirty
and
that
abelard
throughout
his
career
made
use
of
every
social
and
personal
advantage
to
gain
a
point
with
little
scruple
either
in
manner
or
in
sophistry
one
may
easily
imagine
the
scene
teachers
are
always
much
the
same
pupils
and
students
differ
only
in
degrees
of
docility
in
both
classes
began
by
accepting
the
foundations
of
society
as
they
have
to
do
still
only
they
then
accepted
laws
of
the
church
and
aristotle
while
now
they
accept
laws
of
the
legislature
and
of
energy
in
the
students
took
for
granted
that
with
the
help
of
aristotle
and
syllogisms
they
could
build
out
the
church
intellectually
as
the
architects
with
the
help
of
the
pointed
arch
were
soon
to
enlarge
it
architecturally
they
never
doubted
the
certainty
of
their
method
to
them
words
had
fixed
values
like
numbers
and
syllogisms
were
hewn
stones
that
needed
only
to
be
set
in
place
in
order
to
reach
any
height
or
support
any
weight
every
sentence
was
made
to
take
the
form
of
a
syllogism
one
must
have
been
educated
in
a
jesuit
or
dominican
school
in
order
to
frame
these
syllogisms
correctly
but
merely
by
way
of
illustration
one
may
timidly
suggest
how
the
phrases
sounded
in
their
simplest
form
for
example
plato
or
other
equally
good
authority
deemed
substance
as
that
which
stands
underneath
phenomena
the
most
universal
of
universals
the
ultimate
the
highest
in
order
of
generalization
the
ultimate
essence
or
substance
is
indivisible
god
is
substance
god
is
indivisible
the
divine
substance
is
incapable
of
alteration
or
accident
all
other
substance
is
liable
to
alteration
or
accident
therefore
the
divine
substance
differs
from
all
other
substance
a
substance
is
a
universal
as
for
example
humanity
or
the
human
is
a
universal
and
indivisible
the
man
socrates
for
instance
is
not
a
universal
but
an
individual
therefore
the
substance
humanity
being
indivisible
must
exist
entire
and
undivided
in
socrates
the
form
of
logic
most
fascinating
to
youthful
minds
as
well
as
to
some
minds
that
are
only
too
acute
is
the
reductio
ad
absurdum
the
forcing
an
opponent
into
an
absurd
alternative
or
admission
and
the
syllogism
lent
itself
happily
to
this
use
socrates
abused
the
weapon
and
abelard
was
the
first
french
master
of
the
art
but
neither
state
nor
church
likes
to
be
reduced
to
an
absurdity
and
on
the
whole
both
socrates
and
abelard
fared
ill
in
the
result
even
now
one
had
best
be
civil
toward
the
idols
of
the
forum
abelard
would
find
most
of
his
old
problems
sensitive
to
his
touch
time
has
settled
few
or
none
of
the
essential
points
of
dispute
science
hesitates
more
visibly
than
the
church
ever
did
to
decide
once
for
all
whether
unity
or
diversity
is
ultimate
law
whether
order
or
chaos
is
the
governing
rule
of
the
universe
if
universe
there
is
whether
anything
except
phenomena
exists
even
in
matters
more
vital
to
society
one
dares
not
speak
too
loud
why
and
for
what
and
to
whom
is
man
a
responsible
agent
every
jury
and
judge
every
lawyer
and
doctor
every
legislator
and
clergyman
has
his
own
views
and
the
law
constantly
varies
every
nation
may
have
a
different
system
one
court
may
hang
and
another
may
acquit
for
the
same
crime
on
the
same
day
and
science
only
repeats
what
the
church
said
to
abelard
that
where
we
know
so
little
we
had
better
hold
our
tongues
according
to
the
latest
authorities
the
doctrine
of
universals
which
convulsed
the
schools
of
the
twelfth
century
has
never
received
an
adequate
answer
what
is
a
species
what
is
a
genus
or
a
family
or
an
order
more
or
less
convenient
terms
of
classification
about
which
the
twelfth
century
cared
very
little
while
it
cared
deeply
about
the
essence
of
classes
science
has
become
too
complex
to
affirm
the
existence
of
universal
truths
but
it
strives
for
nothing
else
and
disputes
the
problem
within
its
own
limits
almost
as
earnestly
as
in
the
twelfth
century
when
the
whole
field
of
human
and
superhuman
activity
was
shut
between
these
barriers
of
substance
universals
and
particulars
little
has
changed
except
the
vocabulary
and
the
method
the
schools
knew
that
their
society
hung
for
life
on
the
demonstration
that
god
the
ultimate
universal
was
a
reality
out
of
which
all
other
universal
truths
or
realities
sprang
truth
was
a
real
thing
outside
of
human
experience
the
schools
of
paris
talked
and
thought
of
nothing
else
john
of
salisbury
who
attended
abelard
lectures
about
and
became
bishop
of
chartres
in
seems
to
have
been
more
surprised
than
we
need
be
at
the
intensity
of
the
emotion
one
never
gets
away
from
this
question
he
said
from
whatever
point
a
discussion
starts
it
is
always
led
back
and
attached
to
that
it
is
the
madness
of
rufus
about
naevia
thinks
of
nothing
else
talks
of
nothing
else
and
if
naevia
did
not
exist
rufus
would
be
dumb
abelard
began
it
after
his
first
visit
to
paris
in
he
seems
to
have
passed
several
years
elsewhere
while
guillaume
de
champeaux
in
retired
from
the
school
in
the
cloister
of
notre
dame
and
taking
orders
established
a
class
in
a
chapel
near
by
afterwards
famous
as
the
the
jardin
des
plantes
and
the
gare
now
cover
the
ground
where
the
abbey
stood
on
the
banks
of
the
seine
outside
the
latin
quarter
and
not
a
trace
is
left
of
its
site
but
there
william
continued
his
course
in
dialectics
until
suddenly
abelard
reappeared
among
his
scholars
and
resumed
his
old
attacks
this
time
abelard
could
hardly
call
himself
a
student
he
was
thirty
years
old
and
long
since
had
been
himself
a
teacher
he
had
attended
william
course
on
dialectics
nearly
ten
years
before
and
was
past
master
in
the
art
he
had
nothing
to
learn
from
william
in
theology
for
neither
william
nor
he
was
yet
a
theologist
by
profession
if
abelard
went
back
to
school
it
was
certainly
not
to
learn
but
indeed
he
himself
made
little
or
no
pretence
of
it
and
told
with
childlike
candour
not
only
why
he
went
but
also
how
brilliantly
he
succeeded
in
his
object
i
returned
to
study
rhetoric
in
his
school
among
other
controversial
battles
i
succeeded
by
the
most
irrefutable
argument
in
making
him
change
or
rather
ruin
his
doctrine
of
universals
his
doctrine
consisted
in
affirming
the
perfect
identity
of
the
essence
in
every
individual
of
the
same
species
so
that
according
to
him
there
was
no
difference
in
the
essence
but
only
in
the
infinite
variety
of
accidents
he
then
came
to
amend
his
doctrine
so
as
to
affirm
not
the
identity
any
longer
but
the
absence
of
distinction
the
want
of
difference
in
the
essence
and
as
this
question
of
universals
had
always
been
one
of
the
most
important
questions
of
dialectics
so
important
that
porphyry
touching
on
it
in
his
preliminaries
did
not
dare
to
take
the
responsibility
of
cutting
the
knot
but
said
it
is
a
very
grave
point
champeaux
who
was
obliged
to
modify
his
idea
and
then
renounce
it
saw
his
course
fall
into
such
discredit
that
they
hardly
let
him
make
his
dialectical
lectures
as
though
dialectics
consisted
entirely
in
the
question
of
universals
why
was
this
point
so
very
grave
not
because
it
was
mere
dialectics
the
only
part
of
the
story
that
seems
grave
today
is
the
part
that
abelard
left
out
the
part
which
saint
bernard
thirty
years
later
put
in
on
behalf
of
william
we
should
be
more
credulous
than
monks
if
we
believed
on
word
in
that
in
he
had
driven
out
of
the
schools
the
most
accomplished
dialectician
of
the
age
by
an
objection
so
familiar
that
no
other
dialectician
was
ever
silenced
by
it
whatever
may
have
been
the
case
with
theologians
and
so
obvious
that
it
could
not
have
troubled
a
scholar
of
fifteen
william
stated
a
settled
doctrine
as
old
as
plato
abelard
interposed
an
objection
as
old
as
aristotle
probably
plato
and
aristotle
had
received
the
question
and
answer
from
philosophers
years
older
than
themselves
certainly
the
whole
of
philosophy
has
always
been
involved
in
the
dispute
the
subject
is
as
amusing
as
a
comedy
so
amusing
that
ten
minutes
may
be
well
given
to
playing
the
scene
between
william
and
abelard
not
as
it
happened
but
in
a
form
nearer
our
ignorance
with
liberty
to
invent
arguments
for
william
and
analogies
which
are
figures
intended
to
serve
as
fatal
weapons
if
they
succeed
and
as
innocent
toys
if
they
fail
such
as
he
never
imagined
while
abelard
can
respond
with
his
true
rejoinder
fatal
in
a
different
sense
for
the
chief
analogy
the
notes
of
music
would
serve
or
the
colours
of
the
solar
spectrum
or
an
energy
such
as
gravity
but
the
best
is
geometrical
because
euclid
was
as
scholastic
as
william
of
champeaux
himself
and
his
axioms
are
even
more
familiar
to
the
schoolboy
of
the
twentieth
than
to
the
schoolman
of
the
twelfth
century
in
these
scholastic
tournaments
the
two
champions
started
from
opposite
points
one
from
the
ultimate
substance
god
the
universal
the
ideal
the
type
the
other
from
the
individual
socrates
the
concrete
the
observed
fact
of
experience
the
object
of
sensual
perception
the
first
champion
william
in
this
instance
assumed
that
the
universal
was
a
real
thing
and
for
that
reason
he
was
called
a
realist
his
opponent
abelard
held
that
the
universal
was
only
nominally
real
and
on
that
account
he
was
called
a
nominalist
truth
virtue
humanity
exist
as
units
and
realities
said
william
truth
replied
abelard
is
only
the
sum
of
all
possible
facts
that
are
true
as
humanity
is
the
sum
of
all
actual
human
beings
the
ideal
bed
is
a
form
made
by
god
said
plato
the
ideal
bed
is
a
name
imagined
by
ourselves
said
aristotle
i
start
from
the
universe
said
william
i
start
from
the
atom
said
abelard
and
once
having
started
they
necessarily
came
into
collision
at
some
point
between
the
two
william
of
champeaux
lecturing
on
dialectics
or
logic
comes
to
the
question
of
universals
which
he
says
are
substances
starting
from
the
highest
substance
god
all
being
descends
through
created
substances
by
stages
until
it
reaches
the
substance
animality
from
which
it
descends
to
the
substance
humanity
and
humanity
being
like
other
essences
or
substances
indivisible
passes
wholly
into
each
individual
becoming
socrates
plato
and
aristotle
much
as
the
divine
substance
exists
wholly
and
undivided
in
each
member
of
the
trinity
here
abelard
interrupts
the
divine
substance
he
says
operates
by
laws
of
its
own
and
can
not
be
used
for
comparison
in
treating
of
human
substance
one
is
bound
by
human
limitations
if
the
whole
of
humanity
is
in
socrates
it
is
wholly
absorbed
by
socrates
and
can
not
be
at
the
same
time
in
plato
or
elsewhere
following
his
favourite
reductio
ad
absurdum
abelard
turns
the
idea
round
and
infers
from
it
that
since
socrates
carries
all
humanity
in
him
he
carries
plato
too
and
both
must
be
in
the
same
place
though
socrates
is
at
athens
and
plato
in
rome
the
objection
is
familiar
to
william
who
replies
by
another
commonplace
abelard
might
i
without
offence
ask
you
a
simple
matter
can
you
give
me
euclid
definition
of
a
point
if
i
remember
right
it
is
cujus
nulla
pars
est
that
which
has
no
parts
has
it
existence
only
in
our
minds
not
then
in
god
all
necessary
truths
exist
first
in
god
if
the
point
is
a
necessary
truth
it
exists
first
there
then
might
i
ask
you
for
euclid
definition
of
the
line
the
line
is
that
which
has
only
extension
vocatur
illa
quae
solam
longitudinem
habet
can
you
conceive
an
infinite
straight
line
only
as
a
line
which
has
no
end
like
the
point
extended
supposing
we
imagine
a
straight
line
like
opposite
rays
of
the
sun
proceeding
in
opposite
directions
to
infinity
is
it
real
it
has
no
reality
except
in
the
mind
that
conceives
it
supposing
we
divide
that
line
which
has
no
reality
into
two
parts
at
its
origin
in
the
sun
or
star
shall
we
get
two
infinities
or
shall
we
say
two
halves
of
the
infinite
we
conceive
of
each
as
partaking
the
quality
of
infinity
now
let
us
cut
out
the
diameter
of
the
sun
or
rather
since
this
is
what
our
successors
in
the
school
will
do
let
us
take
a
line
of
our
earth
longitude
which
is
equally
unreal
and
measure
a
degree
of
this
thing
which
does
not
exist
and
then
divide
it
into
equal
parts
which
we
will
use
as
a
measure
or
metre
this
metre
which
is
still
nothing
as
i
understand
you
is
infinitely
divisible
into
points
and
the
point
itself
is
infinitely
small
therefore
we
have
the
finite
partaking
the
nature
of
the
infinite
undoubtedly
one
step
more
abelard
if
i
do
not
weary
you
let
me
take
three
of
these
metres
which
do
not
exist
and
place
them
so
that
the
ends
of
one
shall
touch
the
ends
of
the
others
may
i
ask
what
is
that
figure
i
presume
you
mean
it
to
be
a
triangle
precisely
and
what
sort
of
a
triangle
an
equilateral
triangle
the
sides
of
which
measure
one
metre
each
now
let
me
take
three
more
of
these
metres
which
do
not
exist
and
construct
another
triangle
which
does
not
exist
are
these
two
triangles
or
one
triangle
they
are
most
certainly
one
a
single
concept
of
the
only
possible
equilateral
triangle
measuring
one
metre
on
each
face
you
told
us
a
moment
ago
that
a
universal
could
not
exist
wholly
and
exclusively
in
two
individuals
at
once
does
not
the
universal
by
definition
the
equilateral
triangle
measuring
one
metre
on
each
face
does
it
not
exist
wholly
in
its
integrity
of
essence
in
each
of
the
two
triangles
we
have
conceived
it
does
as
a
conception
i
thank
you
now
although
i
fear
wearying
you
perhaps
you
will
consent
to
let
me
add
matter
to
mind
i
have
here
on
my
desk
an
object
not
uncommon
in
nature
which
i
will
ask
you
to
describe
it
appears
to
be
a
crystal
may
i
ask
its
shape
i
should
call
it
a
regular
octahedron
that
is
two
pyramids
set
base
to
base
making
eight
plane
surfaces
each
a
perfect
equilateral
triangle
concedo
triangula
i
grant
the
triangles
do
you
know
perchance
what
is
this
material
which
seems
to
give
substantial
existence
to
these
eight
triangles
i
do
not
nor
i
nor
does
it
matter
unless
you
conceive
it
to
be
the
work
of
man
i
do
not
claim
it
as
man
work
whose
then
we
believe
all
actual
creation
of
matter
united
with
form
to
be
the
work
of
god
surely
not
the
substance
of
god
himself
perhaps
you
mean
that
this
form
this
octahedron
is
a
divine
concept
i
understand
such
to
be
the
doctrine
of
the
church
then
it
seems
that
god
uses
this
concept
habitually
to
create
this
very
common
crystal
one
question
more
and
only
one
if
you
will
permit
me
to
come
to
the
point
does
the
matter
the
material
of
which
this
crystal
is
made
affect
in
any
way
the
form
the
nature
the
soul
of
the
universal
equilateral
triangle
as
you
see
it
bounding
these
eight
plane
surfaces
that
i
do
not
know
and
do
not
think
essential
to
decide
as
far
as
these
triangles
are
individual
they
are
made
so
by
the
will
of
god
and
not
by
the
substance
you
call
triangle
the
universal
the
abstract
right
angle
or
any
other
abstract
form
is
only
an
idea
a
concept
to
which
reality
individuality
or
what
we
might
call
energy
is
wanting
the
only
true
energy
except
man
free
will
is
god
very
good
abelard
we
can
now
reach
our
issue
you
affirm
that
just
as
the
line
does
not
exist
in
space
although
the
eye
sees
little
else
in
space
so
the
triangle
does
not
exist
in
this
crystal
although
the
crystal
shows
eight
of
them
each
perfect
you
are
aware
that
on
this
line
which
does
not
exist
and
its
combination
in
this
triangle
which
does
not
exist
rests
the
whole
fabric
of
mathematics
with
all
its
necessary
truths
in
other
words
you
know
that
in
this
line
though
it
does
not
exist
is
bound
up
the
truth
of
the
only
branch
of
human
knowledge
which
claims
absolute
certainty
for
human
processes
you
admit
that
this
line
and
triangle
which
are
mere
figments
of
our
human
imagination
not
only
exist
independent
of
us
in
the
crystal
but
are
as
we
suppose
habitually
and
invariably
used
by
god
himself
to
give
form
to
the
matter
contained
within
the
planes
of
the
crystal
yet
to
this
line
and
triangle
you
deny
reality
to
mathematical
truth
you
deny
compulsive
force
you
hold
that
an
equilateral
triangle
may
to
you
and
all
other
human
individuals
be
a
triangle
if
you
choose
to
imagine
it
so
allow
me
to
say
without
assuming
any
claim
to
superior
knowledge
that
to
me
your
logic
results
in
a
different
conclusion
if
you
are
compelled
at
one
point
or
another
of
the
chain
of
being
to
deny
existence
to
a
substance
surely
it
should
be
to
the
last
and
feeblest
i
see
nothing
to
hinder
you
from
denying
your
own
existence
which
is
in
fact
impossible
to
demonstrate
certainly
you
are
free
in
logic
to
argue
that
socrates
and
plato
are
mere
names
that
men
and
matter
are
phantoms
and
dreams
no
one
ever
has
proved
or
ever
can
prove
the
contrary
infallibly
a
great
philosophical
school
will
some
day
be
founded
on
that
assumption
i
venture
even
to
recommend
it
to
your
acute
and
sceptical
mind
but
i
can
not
conceive
how
by
any
process
of
reasoning
sensual
or
supersensual
you
can
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
single
form
of
truth
which
instantly
and
inexorably
compels
our
submission
to
its
laws
is
nothing
thus
far
all
was
familiar
ground
certainly
at
least
as
familiar
as
the
pons
asinorum
and
neither
of
the
two
champions
had
need
to
feel
ruffled
in
temper
by
the
discussion
the
real
struggle
began
only
at
this
point
for
until
this
point
was
reached
both
positions
were
about
equally
tenable
abelard
had
hitherto
rested
quietly
on
the
defensive
but
william
last
thrust
obliged
him
to
strike
in
his
turn
and
he
drew
himself
up
for
what
five
hundred
years
later
was
called
the
coup
de
jarnac
i
do
not
deny
he
begins
on
the
contrary
i
affirm
that
the
universal
whether
we
call
it
humanity
or
equilateral
triangle
has
a
sort
of
reality
as
a
concept
that
it
is
something
even
a
substance
if
you
insist
upon
it
undoubtedly
the
sum
of
all
individual
men
results
in
the
concept
of
humanity
what
i
deny
is
that
the
concept
results
in
the
individual
you
have
correctly
stated
the
essence
of
the
point
and
the
line
as
sources
of
our
concept
of
the
infinite
what
i
deny
is
that
they
are
divisions
of
the
infinite
universals
can
not
be
divided
what
is
capable
of
division
can
not
be
a
universal
i
admit
the
force
of
your
analogy
in
the
case
of
the
crystal
but
i
am
obliged
to
point
out
to
you
that
if
you
insist
on
this
analogy
you
will
bring
yourself
and
me
into
flagrant
contradiction
with
the
fixed
foundations
of
the
church
if
the
energy
of
the
triangle
gives
form
to
the
crystal
and
the
energy
of
the
line
gives
reality
to
the
triangle
and
the
energy
of
the
infinite
gives
substance
to
the
line
all
energy
at
last
becomes
identical
with
the
ultimate
substance
god
himself
socrates
becomes
god
in
small
judas
is
identical
with
both
humanity
is
of
the
divine
essence
and
exists
wholly
and
undivided
in
each
of
us
the
equilateral
triangle
we
call
humanity
exists
therefore
entire
identical
in
you
and
me
as
a
subdivision
of
the
infinite
line
space
energy
or
substance
which
is
god
i
need
not
remind
you
that
this
is
pantheism
and
that
if
god
is
the
only
energy
human
free
will
merges
in
god
free
will
the
church
ceases
to
have
a
reason
for
existence
man
can
not
be
held
responsible
for
his
own
acts
either
to
the
church
or
to
the
state
and
finally
though
very
unwillingly
i
must
in
regard
for
my
own
safety
bring
the
subject
to
the
attention
of
the
archbishop
which
as
you
know
better
than
i
will
lead
to
your
seclusion
or
worse
whether
abelard
used
these
precise
words
is
nothing
to
the
point
the
words
he
left
on
record
were
equivalent
to
these
as
translated
by
de
remusat
from
a
manuscript
entitled
glossulae
magistri
petri
baelardi
super
porphyrium
the
phrase
runs
a
grave
heresy
is
at
the
end
of
this
doctrine
for
according
to
it
the
divine
substance
which
is
recognized
as
admitting
of
no
form
is
necessarily
identical
with
every
substance
in
particular
and
with
all
substance
in
general
even
had
he
not
stated
the
heresy
so
bluntly
his
objection
necessarily
pushed
william
in
face
of
it
realism
when
pressed
always
led
to
pantheism
william
of
champeaux
and
bishop
or
archbishop
hildebert
were
personal
friends
and
hildebert
divine
substance
left
no
more
room
for
human
free
will
than
abelard
saw
in
the
geometric
analogy
imagined
for
william
throughout
the
history
of
the
church
for
fifteen
hundred
years
whenever
this
theological
point
has
been
pressed
against
churchmen
it
has
reduced
them
to
evasion
or
to
apology
admittedly
the
weak
point
of
realism
was
its
fatally
pantheistic
term
of
course
william
consulted
his
friends
in
the
church
probably
archbishop
hildebert
among
the
rest
before
deciding
whether
to
maintain
or
to
abandon
his
ground
and
the
result
showed
that
he
was
guided
by
their
advice
realism
was
the
roman
arch
the
only
possible
foundation
for
any
church
because
it
assumed
unity
and
any
other
scheme
was
compelled
to
prove
it
for
a
let
us
see
for
a
moment
what
became
of
the
dialogue
when
pushed
into
theology
in
order
to
reach
some
of
the
reasons
which
reduced
william
to
tacit
abandonment
of
a
doctrine
he
could
never
have
surrendered
unless
under
compulsion
that
he
was
angry
is
sure
for
abelard
by
thus
thrusting
theology
into
dialectics
had
struck
him
a
full
blow
and
william
knew
abelard
well
ah
he
would
have
rejoined
you
are
quick
du
pallet
to
turn
what
i
offered
as
an
analogy
into
an
argument
of
heresy
against
my
person
you
are
at
liberty
to
take
that
course
if
you
choose
though
i
give
you
fair
warning
that
it
will
lead
you
far
but
now
i
must
ask
you
still
another
question
this
concept
that
you
talk
about
this
image
in
the
mind
of
man
of
god
of
matter
for
i
know
not
where
to
seek
it
whether
is
it
a
reality
or
not
i
hold
it
as
in
a
manner
real
i
want
a
categorical
answer
yes
or
no
distinguo
i
must
qualify
i
will
have
no
qualifications
a
substance
either
is
or
not
choose
to
this
challenge
abelard
had
the
choice
of
answering
yes
or
of
answering
no
or
of
refusing
to
answer
at
all
he
seems
to
have
done
the
last
but
we
suppose
him
to
have
accepted
the
wager
of
battle
and
to
answer
yes
then
good
william
rejoins
now
let
us
see
how
your
pantheism
differs
from
mine
my
triangle
exists
as
a
reality
or
what
science
will
call
an
energy
outside
my
mind
in
god
and
is
impressed
on
my
mind
as
it
is
on
a
mirror
like
the
triangle
on
the
crystal
its
energy
giving
form
your
triangle
you
say
is
also
an
energy
but
an
essence
of
my
mind
itself
you
thrust
it
into
the
mind
as
an
integral
part
of
the
mirror
identically
the
same
concept
energy
or
necessary
truth
which
is
inherent
in
god
whatever
subterfuge
you
may
resort
to
sooner
or
later
you
have
got
to
agree
that
your
mind
is
identical
with
god
nature
as
far
as
that
concept
is
concerned
your
pantheism
goes
further
than
mine
as
a
doctrine
of
the
real
presence
peculiar
to
yourself
i
can
commend
it
to
the
archbishop
together
with
your
delation
of
me
supposing
that
abelard
took
the
opposite
course
and
answered
no
my
concept
is
a
mere
sign
a
sign
of
what
in
god
name
a
sound
a
word
a
symbol
an
echo
only
of
my
ignorance
nothing
then
so
truth
and
virtue
and
charity
do
not
exist
at
all
you
suppose
yourself
to
exist
but
you
have
no
means
of
knowing
god
therefore
to
you
god
does
not
exist
except
as
an
echo
of
your
ignorance
and
what
concerns
you
most
the
church
does
not
exist
except
as
your
concept
of
certain
individuals
whom
you
can
not
regard
as
a
unity
and
who
suppose
themselves
to
believe
in
a
trinity
which
exists
only
as
a
sound
or
a
symbol
i
will
not
repeat
your
words
du
pallet
outside
this
cloister
because
the
consequences
to
you
would
certainly
be
fatal
but
it
is
only
too
clear
that
you
are
a
materialist
and
as
such
your
fate
must
be
decided
by
a
church
council
unless
you
prefer
the
stake
by
judgment
of
a
secular
court
in
truth
pure
nominalism
if
indeed
any
one
ever
maintained
it
afforded
no
cover
whatever
nor
did
abelard
concept
help
the
matter
although
for
want
of
a
better
refuge
the
church
was
often
driven
into
it
conceptualism
was
a
device
like
the
false
wooden
roof
to
cover
and
conceal
an
inherent
weakness
of
construction
unity
either
is
or
is
not
if
soldiers
no
matter
in
what
number
can
never
make
an
army
and
worshippers
though
in
millions
do
not
make
a
church
and
all
humanity
united
would
not
necessarily
constitute
a
state
equally
little
can
their
concepts
individual
or
united
constitute
the
one
or
the
other
army
church
and
state
each
is
an
organic
whole
complex
beyond
all
possible
addition
of
units
and
not
a
concept
at
all
but
rather
an
animal
that
thinks
creates
devours
and
destroys
the
attempt
to
bridge
the
chasm
between
multiplicity
and
unity
is
the
oldest
problem
of
philosophy
religion
and
science
but
the
flimsiest
bridge
of
all
is
the
human
concept
unless
somewhere
within
or
beyond
it
an
energy
not
individual
is
hidden
and
in
that
case
the
old
question
instantly
reappears
what
is
that
energy
abelard
would
have
done
well
to
leave
william
alone
but
abelard
was
an
adventurer
and
william
was
a
churchman
to
win
a
victory
over
a
churchman
is
not
very
difficult
for
an
adventurer
and
is
always
a
tempting
amusement
because
the
ambition
of
churchmen
to
shine
in
worldly
contests
is
disciplined
and
checked
by
the
broader
interests
of
the
church
but
the
victory
is
usually
sterile
and
rarely
harms
the
churchman
the
church
cares
for
its
own
probably
the
bishops
advised
william
not
to
insist
on
his
doctrine
although
every
bishop
may
have
held
the
same
view
william
allowed
himself
to
be
silenced
without
a
judgment
and
in
that
respect
stands
almost
if
not
quite
alone
among
schoolmen
the
students
divined
that
he
had
sold
himself
to
the
church
and
consequently
deserted
him
very
soon
he
received
his
reward
in
the
shape
of
the
highest
dignity
open
to
private
ambition
a
bishopric
as
bishop
of
he
made
for
himself
a
great
reputation
which
does
not
concern
us
although
it
deeply
concerned
the
unfortunate
abelard
for
it
happened
either
by
chance
or
design
that
within
a
year
or
two
after
william
established
himself
at
chalons
young
bernard
of
citeaux
chose
a
neighbouring
diocese
in
which
to
establish
a
branch
of
the
cistercian
order
and
bishop
william
took
so
keen
an
interest
in
the
success
of
bernard
as
almost
to
claim
equal
credit
for
it
clairvaux
was
in
a
manner
william
creation
although
not
in
his
diocese
and
yet
if
there
was
a
priest
in
all
france
who
fervently
despised
the
schools
it
was
young
bernard
william
of
champeaux
the
chief
of
schoolmen
could
never
have
gained
bernard
affections
bishop
william
of
chalons
must
have
drifted
far
from
dialectics
into
mysticism
in
order
to
win
the
support
of
clairvaux
and
train
up
a
new
army
of
allies
who
were
to
mark
abelard
for
an
easy
prey
meanwhile
abelard
pursued
his
course
of
triumph
in
the
schools
and
in
due
time
turned
from
dialectics
to
theology
as
every
ambitious
teacher
could
hardly
fail
to
do
his
affair
with
heloise
and
their
marriage
seem
to
have
occupied
his
time
in
or
for
they
both
retired
into
religious
orders
in
and
he
resumed
his
lectures
in
with
his
passion
for
rule
he
was
fatally
certain
to
attempt
ruling
the
church
as
he
ruled
the
schools
and
as
it
was
always
enough
for
him
that
any
point
should
be
tender
in
order
that
he
should
press
upon
it
he
instantly
and
instinctively
seized
on
the
most
sensitive
nerve
of
the
church
system
to
wrench
it
into
his
service
he
became
a
sort
of
apostle
of
the
holy
ghost
that
the
trinity
is
a
mystery
was
a
law
of
theology
so
absolute
as
in
a
degree
to
hide
the
law
of
philosophy
that
the
trinity
was
meant
as
a
solution
of
a
greater
mystery
still
in
truth
as
a
matter
of
philosophy
the
trinity
was
intended
to
explain
the
eternal
and
primary
problem
of
the
process
by
which
unity
could
produce
diversity
starting
from
unity
alone
philosophers
found
themselves
unable
to
stir
hand
or
foot
until
they
could
account
for
duality
to
the
common
ignorant
peasant
no
such
trouble
occurred
for
he
knew
the
trinity
in
its
simpler
form
as
the
first
condition
of
life
like
time
and
space
and
force
no
human
being
was
so
stupid
as
not
to
understand
that
the
father
mother
and
child
made
a
trinity
returning
into
each
other
and
although
every
father
every
mother
and
every
child
from
the
dawn
of
man
intelligence
had
asked
why
and
had
never
received
an
answer
more
intelligible
to
them
than
to
philosophers
they
never
showed
difficulty
in
accepting
that
trinity
as
a
fact
they
might
even
in
their
beneficent
blindness
ask
the
church
why
that
trinity
which
had
satisfied
the
egyptians
for
five
or
years
was
not
good
enough
for
churchmen
they
themselves
were
doing
their
utmost
though
unconsciously
to
identify
the
holy
ghost
with
the
mother
while
philosophy
insisted
on
excluding
the
human
symbol
precisely
because
it
was
human
and
led
back
to
an
infinite
series
philosophy
required
three
units
to
start
from
it
posed
the
equilateral
triangle
not
the
straight
line
as
the
foundation
of
its
deometry
the
first
straight
line
infinite
in
extension
must
be
assumed
and
its
reflection
engendered
the
second
but
whence
came
the
third
under
protest
philosophy
was
compelled
to
accept
the
symbol
of
father
and
son
as
a
matter
of
faith
but
if
the
relation
of
father
and
son
were
accepted
for
the
two
units
which
reflected
each
other
what
relation
expressed
the
holy
ghost
in
philosophy
the
product
of
two
units
was
not
a
third
unit
but
diversity
multiplicity
infinity
the
subject
was
for
that
reason
better
handled
by
the
arabs
whose
reasoning
worked
back
on
the
christian
theologists
and
made
the
point
more
delicate
still
common
people
like
women
and
children
and
ourselves
could
never
understand
the
trinity
naturally
intelligent
people
understood
it
still
less
but
for
them
it
did
not
matter
they
did
not
need
to
understand
it
provided
their
neighbours
would
leave
it
alone
the
mass
of
mankind
wanted
something
nearer
to
them
than
either
the
father
or
the
son
they
wanted
the
mother
and
the
church
tried
in
what
seems
to
women
and
children
and
ourselves
rather
a
feeble
way
to
give
the
holy
ghost
as
far
as
possible
the
mother
attributes
love
charity
grace
but
in
spite
of
conscientious
effort
and
unswerving
faith
the
holy
ghost
remained
to
the
mass
of
frenchmen
somewhat
apart
feared
rather
than
loved
the
sin
against
the
holy
ghost
was
a
haunting
spectre
for
no
one
knew
what
else
it
was
naturally
the
church
and
especially
its
official
theologists
took
an
instinctive
attitude
of
defence
whenever
a
question
on
this
subject
was
asked
and
were
thrown
into
a
flutter
of
irritation
whenever
an
answer
was
suggested
no
man
likes
to
have
his
intelligence
or
good
faith
questioned
especially
if
he
has
doubts
about
it
himself
the
distinguishing
essence
of
the
holy
ghost
as
a
theological
substance
was
its
mystery
that
this
mystery
should
be
touched
at
all
was
annoying
to
every
one
who
knew
the
dangers
that
lurked
behind
the
veil
but
that
it
should
be
freely
handled
before
audiences
of
laymen
by
persons
of
doubtful
character
was
impossible
such
license
must
end
in
discrediting
the
whole
trinity
under
pretence
of
making
it
intelligible
precisely
this
license
was
what
abelard
took
and
on
it
he
chose
to
insist
he
said
nothing
heretical
he
treated
the
holy
ghost
with
almost
exaggerated
respect
as
though
other
churchmen
did
not
quite
appreciate
its
merits
but
he
would
not
let
it
alone
and
the
church
dreaded
every
moment
lest
with
his
enormous
influence
in
the
schools
he
should
raise
a
new
storm
by
his
notorious
indiscretion
yet
so
long
as
he
merely
lectured
he
was
not
molested
only
when
he
began
to
publish
his
theology
did
the
church
interfere
then
a
council
held
at
soissons
in
abruptly
condemned
his
book
in
block
without
reading
it
without
specifying
its
errors
and
without
hearing
his
defence
obliged
him
to
throw
the
manuscript
into
the
fire
with
his
own
hands
and
finally
shut
him
up
in
a
monastery
he
had
invited
the
jurisdiction
by
taking
orders
but
even
the
church
was
shocked
by
the
summary
nature
of
the
judgment
which
seems
to
have
been
quite
irregular
in
fact
the
church
has
never
known
what
it
was
that
the
council
condemned
the
latest
great
work
on
the
trinity
by
the
jesuit
father
de
regnon
suggests
that
abelard
fault
was
in
applying
to
the
trinity
his
theory
of
concepts
yes
he
says
the
mystery
is
explained
the
key
of
conceptualism
has
opened
the
tabernacle
and
saint
bernard
was
right
in
saying
that
thanks
to
abelard
every
one
can
penetrate
it
and
contemplate
it
at
his
ease
the
graceless
even
the
uncircumcised
yes
the
trinity
is
explained
but
after
the
manner
of
the
sabellians
for
to
identify
the
persons
in
the
terms
of
human
concepts
is
in
the
same
stroke
to
destroy
their
propres
although
the
saviour
seems
to
have
felt
no
compunctions
about
identifying
the
persons
of
the
trinity
in
the
terms
of
human
concepts
it
is
clear
that
tourists
and
heretics
had
best
leave
the
church
to
deal
with
its
subsistances
propres
and
with
its
own
members
in
its
own
way
in
sum
the
church
preferred
to
stand
firm
on
the
roman
arch
and
the
architects
seem
now
inclined
to
think
it
was
right
that
scholastic
science
and
the
pointed
arch
proved
to
be
failures
in
the
twelfth
century
the
world
may
have
been
rough
but
it
was
not
stupid
the
council
of
soissons
was
held
while
the
architects
and
sculptors
were
building
the
west
porch
of
chartres
and
the
aquilon
at
averroes
was
born
at
cordova
in
omar
khayyam
died
at
naishapur
in
poetry
and
metaphysics
owned
the
world
and
their
quarrel
with
theology
was
a
private
family
dispute
very
soon
the
tide
turned
decisively
in
abelard
favour
suger
a
political
prelate
became
minister
of
the
king
and
in
march
abbot
of
in
both
capacities
he
took
the
part
of
abelard
released
him
from
restraint
and
even
restored
to
him
liberty
of
instruction
at
least
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
bishop
of
paris
abelard
then
took
a
line
of
conduct
singularly
parallel
with
that
of
bernard
quitting
civilized
life
he
turned
wholly
to
religion
when
the
agreement
he
said
had
been
executed
by
both
parties
to
it
in
presence
of
the
king
and
his
ministers
i
next
retired
within
the
territory
of
troyes
upon
a
desert
spot
which
i
knew
and
on
a
piece
of
ground
given
me
by
certain
persons
i
built
with
the
consent
of
the
bishop
of
the
diocese
a
sort
of
oratory
of
reeds
and
thatch
which
i
placed
under
the
invocation
of
the
holy
trinity
founded
at
first
in
the
name
of
the
holy
trinity
then
placed
under
its
invocation
it
was
called
in
memory
of
my
having
come
there
as
a
fugitive
and
in
my
despair
having
found
some
repose
in
the
consolations
of
divine
grace
this
denomination
was
received
by
many
with
great
astonishment
and
some
attacked
it
with
violence
under
pretext
that
it
was
not
permitted
to
consecrate
a
church
specially
to
the
holy
ghost
any
more
than
to
god
the
father
but
that
according
to
ancient
usage
it
must
be
dedicated
either
to
the
son
alone
or
to
the
trinity
the
spot
is
still
called
paraclete
near
in
the
parish
of
quincey
about
halfway
between
fontainebleau
and
troyes
the
name
paraclete
as
applied
to
the
holy
ghost
meant
the
consoler
the
comforter
the
spirit
of
love
and
grace
as
applied
to
the
oratory
by
abelard
it
meant
a
renewal
of
his
challenge
to
theologists
a
separation
of
the
persons
in
the
trinity
a
vulgarization
of
the
mystery
and
as
his
story
frankly
says
it
was
so
received
by
many
the
spot
was
not
so
remote
but
that
his
scholars
could
follow
him
and
he
invited
them
to
do
so
they
came
in
great
numbers
and
he
lectured
to
them
in
body
i
was
hidden
in
this
spot
but
my
renown
overran
the
whole
world
and
filled
it
with
my
word
undoubtedly
abelard
taught
theology
and
in
defiance
of
the
council
that
had
condemned
him
attempted
to
define
the
persons
of
the
trinity
for
this
purpose
he
had
fallen
on
a
spot
only
fifty
or
sixty
miles
from
clairvaux
where
bernard
was
inspiring
a
contrary
spirit
of
religion
he
placed
himself
on
the
direct
line
between
clairvaux
and
its
source
at
citeaux
near
dijon
indeed
if
he
had
sought
for
a
spot
as
central
as
possible
to
the
active
movement
of
the
church
and
the
time
he
could
have
hit
on
none
more
convenient
and
conspicuous
unless
it
were
the
city
of
troyes
itself
the
capital
of
champagne
some
thirty
miles
away
the
proof
that
he
meant
to
be
aggressive
is
furnished
by
his
own
account
of
the
consequences
two
rivals
he
says
one
of
whom
seems
to
have
been
bernard
of
clairvaux
took
the
field
against
him
and
succeeded
in
exciting
the
hostility
of
certain
ecclesiastical
and
secular
authorities
by
charging
monstrous
things
not
only
against
my
faith
but
also
against
my
manner
of
life
to
such
a
point
as
to
detach
from
me
some
of
my
principal
friends
even
those
who
preserved
some
affection
for
me
dared
no
longer
display
it
for
fear
god
is
my
witness
that
i
never
heard
of
the
union
of
an
ecclesiastical
assembly
without
thinking
that
its
object
was
my
condemnation
the
church
had
good
reason
for
abelard
conduct
defied
discipline
but
far
from
showing
harshness
the
church
this
time
showed
a
true
spirit
of
conciliation
most
creditable
to
bernard
deeply
as
the
cistercians
disliked
and
distrusted
abelard
they
did
not
violently
suppress
him
but
tacitly
consented
to
let
the
authorities
buy
his
silence
with
church
patronage
the
transaction
passed
through
suger
hands
and
offered
an
ordinary
example
of
political
customs
as
old
as
history
an
abbey
in
brittany
became
vacant
at
a
hint
from
the
duke
conan
which
may
well
be
supposed
to
have
been
suggested
from
paris
the
monks
chose
abelard
as
their
new
abbot
and
sent
some
of
their
number
to
suger
to
request
permission
for
abelard
who
was
a
monk
of
to
become
abbot
of
near
vannes
in
brittany
suger
probably
intimated
to
abelard
with
a
certain
degree
of
authority
that
he
had
better
accept
abelard
struck
with
terror
and
as
it
were
under
the
menace
of
a
thunderbolt
accepted
of
course
the
dignity
was
in
effect
banishment
and
worse
and
was
so
understood
on
all
sides
the
though
less
isolated
than
was
not
an
agreeable
winter
residence
though
situated
in
abelard
native
province
of
brittany
only
sixty
or
eighty
miles
from
his
birthplace
it
was
for
him
a
prison
with
the
ocean
around
it
and
a
singularly
wild
people
to
deal
with
but
he
could
have
endured
his
lot
with
contentment
had
not
discipline
or
fear
or
pledge
compelled
him
to
hold
his
tongue
from
when
he
was
sent
to
brittany
until
when
he
reappeared
in
paris
he
never
opened
his
mouth
to
lecture
never
as
god
is
my
witness
never
would
i
have
acquiesced
in
such
an
offer
had
it
not
been
to
escape
no
matter
how
from
the
vexations
with
which
i
was
incessantly
overwhelmed
a
great
career
in
the
church
was
thus
opened
for
him
against
his
will
and
if
he
did
not
die
an
archbishop
it
was
not
wholly
the
fault
of
the
church
already
he
was
a
great
prelate
the
equal
in
rank
of
the
abbe
suger
himself
of
of
peter
the
venerable
of
cluny
of
bernard
of
clairvaux
he
was
in
a
manner
a
peer
of
the
realm
almost
immediately
he
felt
the
advantages
of
the
change
barely
two
years
passed
when
in
the
abbe
suger
in
reforming
his
subordinate
abbey
of
argenteuil
was
obliged
to
disturb
heloise
then
a
sister
in
that
congregation
abelard
was
warned
of
the
necessity
that
his
wife
should
be
protected
and
with
the
assistance
of
everyone
concerned
he
was
allowed
to
establish
his
wife
at
the
paraclete
as
head
of
a
religious
sisterhood
i
returned
there
i
invited
heloise
to
come
there
with
the
nuns
of
her
community
and
when
they
arrived
i
made
them
the
entire
donation
of
the
oratory
and
its
dependencies
the
bishops
cherished
her
as
their
daughter
the
abbots
as
their
sister
the
laymen
as
their
mother
this
was
merely
the
beginning
of
her
favour
and
of
his
for
ten
years
they
were
both
of
them
petted
children
of
the
church
the
formal
establishment
of
heloise
at
the
paraclete
took
place
in
in
february
on
the
death
of
the
pope
at
rome
a
schism
broke
out
and
the
cardinals
elected
two
popes
one
of
whom
took
the
name
of
innocent
ii
and
appealed
for
support
to
france
suger
saw
a
great
political
opportunity
and
used
it
the
heads
of
the
french
church
agreed
in
supporting
innocent
and
the
king
summoned
a
church
council
at
etampes
to
declare
its
adhesion
the
council
met
in
the
late
summer
bernard
of
clairvaux
took
the
lead
peter
the
venerable
suger
of
and
the
abbot
of
rhuys
supported
him
innocent
himself
took
refuge
at
cluny
in
october
and
on
january
he
stopped
at
the
benedictine
abbey
of
morigny
the
chronicle
of
the
monastery
recording
the
abbots
present
on
this
occasion
the
abbot
of
morigny
itself
of
feversham
of
of
beauvais
and
so
forth
added
especially
bernard
of
clairvaux
who
was
then
the
most
famous
pulpit
orator
in
france
and
peter
abelard
abbot
of
also
a
monk
and
the
most
eminent
master
of
the
schools
to
which
the
scholars
of
almost
all
the
latin
races
flowed
innocent
needed
popular
support
bernard
and
abelard
were
the
two
leaders
of
popular
opinion
in
france
to
attach
them
innocent
could
refuse
nothing
probably
abelard
remained
with
innocent
but
in
any
case
innocent
gave
him
at
auxerre
in
the
following
november
a
diploma
granting
to
heloise
prioress
of
the
oratory
of
the
holy
trinity
all
rights
of
property
over
whatever
she
might
possess
against
all
assailants
which
proves
abelard
favour
at
this
time
he
seems
to
have
taken
great
interest
in
the
new
sisterhood
i
made
them
more
frequent
visits
he
said
in
order
to
work
for
their
benefit
he
worked
so
earnestly
for
their
benefit
that
he
scandalized
the
neighbourhood
and
had
to
argue
at
unnecessary
length
his
innocence
of
evil
he
went
so
far
as
to
express
a
wish
to
take
refuge
among
them
and
to
abandon
his
abbey
in
brittany
he
professed
to
stand
in
terror
of
his
monks
he
excommunicated
them
they
paid
no
attention
to
him
he
appealed
to
the
pope
his
friend
and
innocent
sent
a
special
legate
to
enforce
their
submission
in
presence
of
the
count
and
the
bishops
even
since
that
they
would
not
keep
quiet
and
quite
recently
since
the
expulsion
of
those
of
whom
i
have
spoken
when
i
returned
to
the
abbey
abandoning
myself
to
the
rest
of
the
brothers
who
inspired
me
with
less
distrust
i
found
them
even
worse
than
the
others
it
was
no
longer
a
question
of
poison
it
was
the
dagger
that
they
now
sharpened
against
my
breast
i
had
great
difficulty
in
escaping
from
them
under
the
guidance
of
one
of
the
neighbouring
lords
similar
perils
menace
me
still
and
every
day
i
see
the
sword
raised
over
my
head
even
at
table
i
can
hardly
breathe
this
is
the
torture
that
i
endure
every
moment
of
the
day
i
a
poor
monk
raised
to
the
prelacy
becoming
more
miserable
in
becoming
more
great
that
by
my
example
the
ambitious
may
learn
to
curb
their
greed
with
this
the
story
of
calamity
ends
the
allusions
to
innocent
ii
seem
to
prove
that
it
was
written
not
earlier
than
the
confession
of
constant
and
abject
personal
fear
suggests
that
it
was
written
under
the
shock
caused
by
the
atrocious
murder
of
the
prior
of
by
the
nephews
of
the
archdeacon
of
paris
who
had
also
been
subjected
to
reforms
this
murder
was
committed
a
few
miles
outside
of
the
walls
of
paris
on
august
the
story
of
calamity
is
evidently
a
long
plea
for
release
from
the
restraints
imposed
on
its
author
by
his
position
in
the
prelacy
and
the
tacit
or
possibly
the
express
contract
he
had
made
or
to
which
he
had
submitted
in
this
plea
was
obviously
written
in
order
to
serve
one
of
two
purposes
either
to
be
placed
before
the
authorities
whose
consent
alone
could
relieve
abelard
from
his
restraints
or
to
justify
him
in
throwing
off
the
load
of
the
church
and
resuming
the
profession
of
schoolman
supposing
the
second
explanation
the
date
of
the
paper
would
be
more
or
less
closely
fixed
by
john
of
salisbury
who
coming
to
paris
as
a
student
in
found
abelard
lecturing
on
the
genevieve
that
is
to
say
not
under
the
license
of
the
bishop
of
paris
or
his
chancellor
but
independently
in
a
private
school
of
his
own
outside
the
walls
i
attached
myself
to
the
palatine
peripatician
who
then
presided
on
the
hill
of
the
doctor
illustrious
admired
by
all
there
at
his
feet
i
received
the
first
elements
of
the
dialectic
art
and
according
to
the
measure
of
my
poor
understanding
i
received
with
all
the
avidity
of
my
soul
everything
that
came
from
his
mouth
this
explanation
is
hardly
reasonable
for
no
prelate
who
was
not
also
a
temporal
lord
would
have
dared
throw
off
his
official
duties
without
permission
from
his
superiors
in
abelard
case
the
only
superior
to
whom
he
could
apply
as
abbot
of
in
brittany
was
probably
the
pope
himself
in
the
year
the
moment
was
exceedingly
favourable
for
asking
privileges
innocent
driven
from
rome
a
second
time
had
summoned
a
council
at
pisa
for
may
to
help
him
and
his
minister
suger
gave
at
first
no
support
to
this
council
and
were
overruled
by
bernard
of
clairvaux
who
in
a
manner
drove
them
into
giving
the
french
clergy
permission
to
attend
the
principal
archbishops
a
number
of
bishops
and
sixteen
abbots
went
to
pisa
in
may
and
some
one
of
them
certainly
asked
innocent
for
favours
on
behalf
of
abelard
which
the
pope
granted
the
proof
is
a
papal
bull
dated
in
in
favour
of
heloise
giving
her
the
rank
and
title
of
abbess
accompanied
by
another
giving
to
the
oratory
of
the
holy
trinity
the
rank
and
name
of
monastery
of
the
paraclete
a
novelty
in
church
tradition
so
extraordinary
or
so
shocking
that
it
still
astounds
churchmen
with
this
excessive
mark
of
favour
innocent
could
have
felt
little
difficulty
in
giving
abelard
the
permission
to
absent
himself
from
his
abbey
and
with
this
permission
in
his
hands
abelard
might
have
lectured
on
dialectics
to
john
of
salisbury
in
the
summer
or
autumn
of
he
did
not
as
far
as
known
resume
lectures
on
theology
such
success
might
have
turned
heads
much
better
balanced
than
that
of
abelard
with
the
support
of
the
pope
and
at
least
one
of
the
most
prominent
cardinals
and
with
relations
at
court
with
the
ministers
of
abelard
seemed
to
himself
as
strong
as
bernard
of
clairvaux
and
a
more
popular
champion
of
reform
the
year
which
has
marked
a
date
for
so
many
great
points
in
our
travels
marked
also
the
moment
of
abelard
greatest
vogue
the
victory
of
aristotle
and
the
pointed
arch
seemed
assured
when
suger
effected
the
marriage
of
the
young
prince
louis
to
the
heiress
eleanor
of
guienne
the
exact
moment
was
stamped
on
the
facade
of
his
exquisite
creation
the
abbey
church
of
finished
in
and
still
in
part
erect
from
to
was
but
a
step
seems
to
stand
close
in
succession
to
fortunately
for
tourists
the
world
restless
though
it
might
be
could
not
hurry
and
abelard
was
to
know
of
the
pointed
arch
very
little
except
its
restlessness
just
at
the
apex
of
his
triumph
august
died
six
months
afterwards
the
pope
also
died
the
schism
ended
and
innocent
ii
needed
help
no
more
bernard
of
clairvaux
became
pope
and
king
at
once
both
innocent
and
were
in
a
manner
his
personal
creations
the
king
brother
henry
next
in
succession
actually
became
a
monk
at
clairvaux
not
long
afterwards
even
the
architecture
told
the
same
story
for
at
though
the
arch
might
simulate
a
point
the
old
romanesque
lines
still
assert
as
firmly
as
ever
their
spiritual
control
the
fleche
that
gave
the
facade
a
new
spirit
was
not
added
until
which
marks
error
in
terms
of
time
once
arrived
at
power
bernard
made
short
work
of
all
that
tried
to
resist
him
during
he
seems
to
have
been
too
busy
or
too
ill
to
take
up
the
affair
of
abelard
but
in
march
the
attack
was
opened
in
a
formal
letter
from
william
of
who
was
bernard
closest
friend
bringing
charges
against
abelard
before
bernard
and
the
bishop
of
chartres
the
charges
were
simple
enough
pierre
abelard
seized
the
moment
when
all
the
masters
of
ecclesiastical
doctrine
have
disappeared
from
the
scene
of
the
world
to
conquer
a
place
apart
for
himself
in
the
schools
and
to
create
there
an
exclusive
domination
he
treats
holy
scripture
as
though
it
were
dialectics
it
is
a
matter
with
him
of
personal
invention
and
annual
novelties
he
is
the
censor
and
not
the
disciple
of
the
faith
the
corrector
and
not
the
imitator
of
the
authorized
masters
in
substance
this
is
all
the
need
of
action
was
even
simpler
abelard
novelties
were
becoming
a
danger
they
affected
not
only
the
schools
but
also
even
the
curia
at
rome
bernard
must
act
because
there
was
no
one
else
to
act
this
man
fears
you
he
dreads
you
if
you
shut
your
eyes
whom
will
he
fear
the
evil
has
become
too
public
to
allow
a
correction
limited
to
amicable
discipline
and
secret
warning
in
fact
abelard
works
were
flying
about
europe
in
every
direction
and
every
year
produced
a
novelty
one
can
still
read
them
in
cousin
collected
edition
among
others
a
volume
on
ethics
ethica
seu
scito
teipsum
on
theology
in
general
an
epitome
a
dialogus
inter
philosophum
judaeum
et
christianum
and
what
was
perhaps
the
most
alarming
of
all
an
abstract
of
quotations
from
standard
authorities
on
the
principle
of
the
parallel
column
showing
the
fatal
contradictions
of
the
authorized
masters
and
entitled
sic
et
non
not
one
of
these
works
but
dealt
with
sacred
matters
in
a
spirit
implying
that
the
essence
of
god
was
better
understood
by
pierre
du
pallet
than
by
the
whole
array
of
bishops
and
prelates
in
europe
had
bernard
been
fortunate
enough
to
light
upon
the
story
of
calamity
which
must
also
have
been
in
existence
he
would
have
found
there
abelard
own
childlike
avowal
that
he
taught
theology
because
his
scholars
said
that
they
did
not
want
mere
words
that
one
can
believe
only
what
one
understands
and
that
it
is
ridiculous
to
preach
to
others
what
one
understands
no
better
than
they
do
bernard
himself
never
charged
abelard
with
any
presumption
equal
to
this
bernard
said
only
that
he
sees
nothing
as
an
enigma
nothing
as
in
a
mirror
but
looks
on
everything
face
to
face
if
this
had
been
all
even
bernard
could
scarcely
have
complained
for
several
thousand
years
mankind
has
stared
infinity
in
the
face
without
pretending
to
be
the
wiser
the
pretension
of
abelard
was
that
by
his
dialectic
method
he
could
explain
the
infinite
while
all
other
theologists
talked
mere
words
and
by
way
of
proving
that
he
had
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
matter
he
laid
down
the
ultimate
law
of
the
universe
as
his
all
that
god
does
he
said
he
wills
necessarily
and
does
it
necessarily
for
his
goodness
is
such
that
it
pushes
him
necessarily
to
do
all
the
good
he
can
and
the
best
he
can
and
the
quickest
he
can
therefore
it
is
of
necessity
that
god
willed
and
made
the
world
pure
logic
admitted
no
contingency
it
was
bound
to
be
necessitarian
or
ceased
to
be
logical
but
the
result
as
bernard
understood
it
was
that
abelard
world
being
the
best
and
only
possible
need
trouble
itself
no
more
about
god
or
church
or
man
strange
as
the
paradox
seems
saint
bernard
and
lord
bacon
though
looking
at
the
world
from
opposite
standpoints
agreed
in
this
that
the
scholastic
method
was
false
and
mischievous
and
that
the
longer
it
was
followed
the
greater
was
its
mischief
bernard
thought
that
because
dialectics
led
wrong
therefore
faith
led
right
he
saw
no
alternative
and
perhaps
in
fact
there
was
none
if
he
had
lived
a
century
later
he
would
have
said
to
thomas
aquinas
what
he
said
to
a
schoolman
of
his
own
day
if
you
had
once
tasted
true
food
if
you
knew
what
true
religion
is
how
quick
you
would
leave
those
jew
makers
of
books
literatoribus
judaeis
to
gnaw
their
crusts
by
themselves
locke
or
hume
might
perhaps
still
have
resented
a
little
the
literator
judaeus
but
faraday
or
would
have
expressed
the
same
opinion
with
only
the
change
of
a
word
if
the
twelfth
century
had
once
tasted
true
science
how
quick
they
would
have
dropped
avicenna
and
averroes
science
admits
that
bernard
disbelief
in
scholasticism
was
well
founded
whatever
it
may
think
of
his
reasons
the
only
point
that
remains
is
personal
which
is
the
more
sympathetic
bernard
or
abelard
the
church
feels
no
doubt
but
is
a
bad
witness
bernard
is
not
a
character
to
be
taken
or
rejected
in
a
lump
he
was
and
even
toward
abelard
he
showed
more
than
one
surface
he
wanted
no
unnecessary
scandals
in
the
church
he
had
too
many
that
were
not
of
his
seeking
he
seems
to
have
gone
through
the
forms
of
friendly
negotiation
with
abelard
although
he
could
have
required
nothing
less
than
abelard
submission
and
return
to
brittany
and
silence
terms
which
abelard
thought
worse
than
death
on
abelard
refusal
bernard
began
his
attack
we
know
from
the
story
of
calamity
what
bernard
party
could
not
have
certainly
known
then
the
abject
terror
into
which
the
very
thought
of
a
council
had
for
twenty
years
thrown
abelard
whenever
he
was
threatened
with
it
and
in
he
saw
it
to
be
inevitable
he
preferred
to
face
it
with
dignity
and
requested
to
be
heard
at
a
council
to
meet
at
sens
in
june
one
can
not
admit
that
he
felt
the
shadow
of
a
hope
to
escape
at
the
utmost
he
could
have
dreamed
of
nothing
more
than
a
hearing
bernard
friends
who
had
a
lively
fear
of
his
dialectics
took
care
to
shut
the
door
on
even
this
hope
the
council
was
carefully
packed
and
overawed
the
king
was
present
archbishops
bishops
abbots
and
other
prelates
by
the
score
bernard
acted
in
person
as
the
prosecuting
attorney
the
public
outside
were
stimulated
to
threaten
violence
abelard
had
less
chance
of
a
judicial
hearing
than
he
had
had
at
soissons
twenty
years
before
he
acted
with
a
proper
sense
of
their
dignity
and
his
own
by
simply
appearing
and
entering
an
appeal
to
rome
the
council
paid
no
attention
to
the
appeal
but
passed
to
an
immediate
condemnation
his
friends
said
that
it
was
done
after
dinner
that
when
the
volume
of
theology
was
produced
and
the
clerk
began
to
read
it
aloud
after
the
first
few
sentences
the
bishops
ceased
attention
talked
joked
laughed
stamped
their
feet
got
angry
and
at
last
went
to
sleep
they
were
waked
only
to
growl
damnamus
namus
and
so
made
an
end
the
story
may
be
true
for
all
prelates
even
in
the
twelfth
century
were
not
bernards
of
clairvaux
or
peters
of
cluny
all
drank
wine
and
all
were
probably
sleepy
after
dinner
while
abelard
writings
are
for
the
most
part
exceedingly
hard
reading
the
clergy
knew
quite
well
what
they
were
doing
the
judgment
was
certain
long
in
advance
and
the
council
was
called
only
to
register
it
political
trials
were
usually
mere
forms
the
appeal
to
rome
seems
to
have
been
taken
seriously
by
bernard
which
is
surprising
unless
the
character
of
innocent
ii
inspired
his
friends
with
doubts
unknown
to
us
innocent
owed
everything
to
bernard
while
abelard
owed
everything
to
innocent
the
pope
was
not
in
a
position
to
alienate
the
french
church
or
the
french
king
to
any
one
who
knows
only
what
is
now
to
be
known
bernard
seems
to
have
been
sure
of
the
curia
yet
he
wrote
in
a
tone
of
excitement
as
though
he
feared
abelard
influence
there
even
more
than
at
home
he
became
abusive
abelard
was
a
crawling
viper
coluber
tortuosus
who
had
come
out
of
his
hole
egressus
est
de
caverna
sua
and
after
the
manner
of
a
hydra
in
similitudinem
hydrae
after
having
one
head
cut
off
at
soissons
had
thrown
out
seven
more
he
was
a
monk
without
rule
a
prelate
without
responsibility
an
abbot
without
discipline
disputing
with
boys
conversing
with
women
the
charges
in
themselves
seem
to
be
literally
true
and
would
not
in
some
later
centuries
have
been
thought
very
serious
neither
faith
nor
morals
were
impugned
on
the
other
hand
abelard
never
affected
or
aspired
to
be
a
saint
while
bernard
always
affected
to
judge
the
acts
and
motives
of
his
from
a
standpoint
of
more
than
worldly
charity
bernard
had
no
right
to
vices
he
claimed
to
be
judged
by
a
higher
standard
but
his
temper
was
none
of
the
best
and
his
pride
was
something
of
the
worst
which
gave
to
peter
the
venerable
occasion
for
turning
on
him
sharply
with
a
rebuke
that
cut
to
the
bone
you
perform
all
the
difficult
religious
duties
wrote
peter
to
the
saint
who
wrought
miracles
you
fast
you
watch
you
suffer
but
you
will
not
endure
the
easy
ones
you
do
not
love
non
vis
levia
ferre
ut
diligas
this
was
the
end
of
abelard
of
course
the
pope
confirmed
the
judgment
and
even
hurried
to
do
so
in
order
that
he
might
not
be
obliged
to
give
abelard
a
hearing
the
judgment
was
not
severe
as
judgments
went
indeed
it
amounted
to
little
more
than
an
order
to
keep
silence
and
as
it
happened
was
never
carried
into
effect
abelard
at
best
a
nervous
invalid
started
for
rome
but
stopped
at
cluny
perhaps
the
most
agreeable
in
europe
personally
he
seems
to
have
been
a
favourite
of
abbot
peter
the
venerable
whose
love
for
bernard
was
not
much
stronger
than
abelard
or
suger
bernard
was
an
excessively
sharp
critic
and
spared
worldliness
or
what
he
thought
lack
of
spirituality
in
no
prelate
whatever
clairvaux
existed
for
nothing
else
politically
than
as
a
rebuke
to
them
all
and
bernard
enmity
was
their
bond
of
union
under
the
protection
of
peter
the
venerable
the
most
amiable
figure
of
the
twelfth
century
and
in
the
most
agreeable
residence
in
europe
abelard
remained
unmolested
at
cluny
occupied
as
is
believed
in
writing
or
revising
his
treatises
in
defiance
of
the
council
he
died
there
two
years
later
april
in
full
communion
still
nominal
abbot
of
and
so
distinguished
a
prelate
that
peter
the
venerable
thought
himself
obliged
to
write
a
charming
letter
to
heloise
at
the
paraclete
not
far
away
condoling
with
her
on
the
loss
of
a
husband
who
was
the
socrates
the
aristotle
the
plato
of
france
and
the
west
who
if
among
logicians
he
had
rivals
had
no
master
who
was
the
prince
of
study
learned
eloquent
subtle
penetrating
who
overcame
everything
by
the
force
of
reason
and
was
never
so
great
as
when
he
passed
to
true
philosophy
that
of
christ
all
this
was
in
latin
verses
and
seems
sufficiently
strong
considering
that
abelard
philosophy
had
been
so
recently
and
so
emphatically
condemned
by
the
entire
church
including
peter
the
venerable
himself
the
twelfth
century
had
this
singular
charm
of
liberty
in
practice
just
as
its
architecture
knew
no
mathematical
formula
of
precision
but
peter
letter
to
heloise
went
further
still
and
rang
with
absolute
passion
thus
dear
and
venerable
sister
in
god
he
to
whom
you
are
united
after
your
tie
in
the
flesh
by
the
better
and
stronger
bond
of
the
divine
love
he
with
whom
and
under
whom
you
have
served
the
lord
the
lord
now
takes
in
your
place
like
another
you
and
warms
in
his
bosom
and
for
the
day
of
his
coming
when
shall
sound
the
voice
of
the
archangel
and
the
trumpet
of
god
descending
from
heaven
he
keeps
him
to
restore
him
to
you
by
his
grace
chapter
xv
the
mystics
the
schoolmen
of
the
twelfth
century
thought
they
could
reach
god
by
reason
the
council
of
sens
guided
by
saint
bernard
replied
that
the
effort
was
futile
and
likely
to
be
mischievous
the
council
made
little
pretence
of
knowing
or
caring
what
method
abelard
followed
they
condemned
any
effort
at
all
on
that
line
and
no
sooner
had
bernard
silenced
the
abbot
of
for
innovation
than
he
turned
about
and
silenced
the
bishop
of
poitiers
for
conservatism
neither
in
the
twelfth
nor
in
any
other
century
could
three
men
have
understood
alike
the
meaning
of
gilbert
de
la
poree
who
seems
to
one
high
authority
unworthy
of
notice
and
to
another
worthy
of
an
elaborate
but
quite
unintelligible
commentary
when
rousselet
and
haureau
judge
so
differently
of
a
voluminous
writer
the
council
at
rheims
which
censured
bishop
gilbert
in
can
hardly
have
been
clear
in
mind
one
dare
hazard
no
more
than
a
guess
at
offence
but
the
guess
is
tolerably
safe
that
he
like
abelard
insisted
on
discussing
and
analyzing
the
trinity
gilbert
seems
to
have
been
a
rigid
realist
and
he
reduced
to
a
correct
syllogism
the
idea
of
the
ultimate
substance
god
to
make
theology
a
system
capable
of
scholastic
definition
he
had
to
suppose
behind
the
active
deity
a
passive
abstraction
or
absolute
substance
without
attributes
and
then
the
attributes
justice
mercy
and
the
rest
fell
into
rank
as
secondary
substances
formam
dei
divinitatem
appellant
bernard
answered
him
by
insisting
with
his
usual
fiery
conviction
that
the
church
should
lay
down
the
law
once
for
all
and
inscribe
it
with
iron
and
diamond
that
divinity
divine
wisdom
is
god
in
philosophy
and
science
the
question
seems
to
be
still
open
whether
anything
ultimate
exists
whether
substance
is
more
than
a
complex
of
elements
whether
the
thing
in
itself
is
a
reality
or
a
name
is
a
question
that
faraday
and
seem
to
answer
as
bernard
did
while
haeckel
answers
it
as
gilbert
did
but
in
theology
even
a
heretic
wonders
how
a
doubt
was
possible
the
absolute
substance
behind
the
attributes
seems
to
be
pure
spinoza
this
supposes
that
the
heretic
understands
what
gilbert
or
haeckel
meant
which
is
certainly
a
mistake
but
it
is
possible
that
he
may
see
in
part
what
bernard
meant
and
this
is
enough
if
it
is
all
abelard
necessitarianism
and
gilbert
spinozism
if
bernard
understood
them
right
were
equally
impossible
theology
and
the
church
could
by
no
evasion
escape
the
necessity
of
condemning
both
unfortunately
bernard
could
not
put
his
foot
down
so
roughly
on
the
schools
without
putting
it
on
aristotle
as
well
and
for
at
least
sixty
years
after
the
council
of
rheims
aristotle
was
either
tacitly
or
expressly
prohibited
one
can
not
stop
to
explain
why
aristotle
himself
would
have
been
first
to
forbid
the
teaching
of
what
was
called
by
his
name
in
the
middle
ages
but
you
are
bound
to
remember
that
this
period
between
and
was
that
of
transition
architecture
and
art
one
must
go
to
noyon
soissons
and
laon
to
study
the
church
that
trampled
on
the
schools
one
must
recall
how
the
peasants
of
normandy
and
the
chartrain
were
crusading
for
the
virgin
in
and
building
her
fleches
at
chartres
and
while
bernard
was
condemning
gilbert
at
rheims
in
we
must
go
to
the
poets
to
see
what
they
all
meant
by
it
but
the
sum
is
an
emotion
clear
and
strong
as
love
and
much
clearer
than
logic
whose
charm
lies
in
its
unstable
balance
the
transition
is
the
equilibrium
between
the
love
of
god
which
is
faith
and
the
logic
of
god
which
is
reason
between
the
round
arch
and
the
pointed
one
may
not
be
sure
which
pleases
most
but
one
need
not
be
harsh
toward
people
who
think
that
the
moment
of
balance
is
exquisite
the
last
and
highest
moment
is
seen
at
chartres
where
in
the
charm
depends
on
the
constant
doubt
whether
emotion
or
science
is
uppermost
at
amiens
doubt
ceases
emotion
is
trained
in
school
thomas
aquinas
reigns
bernard
of
clairvaux
and
thomas
of
aquino
were
both
artists
very
great
artists
if
the
church
pleases
and
one
need
not
decide
which
was
the
greater
but
between
them
is
a
region
of
pure
emotion
of
poetry
and
art
which
is
more
interesting
than
either
in
every
age
man
has
been
apt
to
dream
uneasily
rolling
from
side
to
side
beating
against
imaginary
bars
unless
tired
out
he
has
sunk
into
indifference
or
scepticism
religious
minds
prefer
scepticism
the
true
saint
is
a
profound
sceptic
a
total
disbeliever
in
human
reason
who
has
more
than
once
joined
hands
on
this
ground
with
some
who
were
at
best
sinners
bernard
was
a
total
disbeliever
in
scholasticism
so
was
voltaire
bernard
brought
the
society
of
his
time
to
share
his
scepticism
but
could
give
the
society
no
other
intellectual
amusement
to
relieve
its
restlessness
his
crusade
failed
his
ascetic
enthusiasm
faded
god
came
no
nearer
if
there
was
in
all
france
between
and
a
more
typical
englishman
of
the
future
church
of
england
type
than
john
of
salisbury
he
has
left
no
trace
and
john
wrote
a
description
of
his
time
which
makes
a
picturesque
contrast
with
the
picture
painted
by
abelard
his
old
master
of
the
century
at
its
beginning
john
weighed
abelard
and
the
schools
against
bernard
and
the
cloister
and
coolly
concluded
that
the
way
to
truth
led
rather
through
citeaux
which
brought
him
to
chartres
as
bishop
in
and
to
a
mild
scepticism
in
faith
i
prefer
to
doubt
he
said
rather
than
rashly
define
what
is
hidden
the
battle
with
the
schools
had
then
resulted
only
in
creating
three
kinds
of
sceptics
the
disbelievers
in
human
reason
the
passive
agnostics
and
the
sceptics
proper
who
would
have
been
atheists
had
they
dared
the
first
class
was
represented
by
the
school
of
the
second
by
john
of
salisbury
himself
the
third
by
a
class
of
schoolmen
whom
he
called
cornificii
as
though
they
made
a
practice
of
inventing
horns
of
dilemma
on
which
to
fix
their
opponents
as
for
example
they
asked
whether
a
pig
which
was
led
to
market
was
led
by
the
man
or
the
cord
one
asks
instantly
what
cord
whether
grace
for
instance
or
free
will
bishop
john
used
the
science
he
had
learned
in
the
school
only
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
if
philosophy
were
a
science
at
all
its
best
practical
use
was
to
teach
charity
love
even
the
early
superficial
debates
of
the
schools
in
had
so
exhausted
the
subject
that
the
most
intelligent
men
saw
how
little
was
to
be
gained
by
pursuing
further
those
lines
of
thought
the
twelfth
century
had
already
reached
the
point
where
the
seventeenth
century
stood
when
descartes
renewed
the
attempt
to
give
a
solid
philosophical
basis
for
deism
by
his
celebrated
cogito
ergo
sum
although
that
ultimate
fact
seemed
new
to
europe
when
descartes
revived
it
as
the
of
his
demonstration
it
was
as
old
and
familiar
as
saint
augustine
to
the
twelfth
century
and
as
little
conclusive
as
any
other
assumption
of
the
ego
or
the
the
schools
argued
according
to
their
tastes
from
unity
to
multiplicity
or
from
multiplicity
to
unity
but
what
they
wanted
was
to
connect
the
two
they
tried
realism
and
found
that
it
led
to
pantheism
they
tried
nominalism
and
found
that
it
ended
in
materialism
they
attempted
a
compromise
in
conceptualism
which
begged
the
whole
question
then
they
lay
down
exhausted
in
the
seventeenth
century
the
same
violent
struggle
broke
out
again
and
wrung
from
pascal
the
famous
outcry
of
despair
in
which
the
french
language
rose
perhaps
for
the
last
time
to
the
grand
style
of
the
twelfth
century
to
the
twelfth
century
it
belongs
to
the
century
of
faith
and
simplicity
not
to
the
mathematical
certainties
of
descartes
and
leibnitz
and
newton
or
to
the
mathematical
abstractions
of
spinoza
descartes
had
proclaimed
his
famous
conceptual
proof
of
god
i
am
conscious
of
myself
and
must
exist
i
am
conscious
of
god
and
he
must
exist
pascal
wearily
replied
that
it
was
not
god
he
doubted
but
logic
he
was
tortured
by
the
impossibility
of
rejecting
man
reason
by
reason
unconsciously
sceptical
he
forced
himself
to
disbelieve
in
himself
rather
than
admit
a
doubt
of
god
man
had
tried
to
prove
god
and
had
failed
the
metaphysical
proofs
of
god
are
so
remote
eloignees
from
the
reasoning
of
men
and
so
contradictory
impliquees
that
they
make
little
impression
and
even
if
they
served
to
convince
some
people
it
would
only
be
during
the
instant
that
they
see
the
demonstration
an
hour
afterwards
they
fear
to
have
deceived
themselves
moreover
this
kind
of
proof
could
lead
only
to
a
speculative
knowledge
and
to
know
god
only
in
that
way
was
not
to
know
him
at
all
the
only
way
to
reach
god
was
to
deny
the
value
of
reason
and
to
deny
reason
was
scepticism

je

que
si

tout

tout
ou

afin
que
je
visse
quel
parti
je
dois
suivre
when
i
see
the
blindness
and
misery
of
man
and
the
astonishing
contradictions
revealed
in
his
nature
and
observe
the
whole
universe
mute
and
man
without
light
abandoned
to
himself
as
though
lost
in
this
corner
of
the
universe
without
knowing
who
put
him
here
or
what
he
has
come
here
to
do
or
what
will
become
of
him
in
dying
i
feel
fear
like
a
man
who
has
been
carried
when
asleep
into
a
desert
and
fearful
island
and
has
waked
without
knowing
where
he
is
and
without
having
means
of
rescue
and
thereupon
i
wonder
how
man
escapes
despair
at
so
miserable
an
estate
i
see
others
about
me
like
myself
and
i
ask
them
if
they
are
better
informed
than
i
and
they
tell
me
no
and
then
these
wretched
wanderers
after
looking
about
them
and
seeing
some
pleasant
object
have
given
themselves
up
and
attached
themselves
to
it
as
for
me
i
can
not
stop
there
or
rest
in
the
company
of
these
persons
wholly
like
myself
miserable
like
me
impotent
like
me
i
see
that
they
would
not
help
me
to
die
i
shall
die
alone
i
must
then
act
as
though
alone
but
if
i
were
alone
i
should
not
build
houses
i
should
not
fret
myself
with
bustling
occupations
i
should
seek
the
esteem
of
no
one
but
i
should
try
only
to
discover
the
truth
so
considering
how
much
appearance
there
is
that
something
exists
other
than
what
i
see
i
have
sought
whether
this
god
of
whom
every
one
talks
may
not
have
left
some
marks
of
himself
i
search
everywhere
and
see
only
obscurity
everywhere
nature
offers
me
nothing
but
matter
of
possible
doubt
and
disquiet
if
i
saw
there
nothing
to
mark
a
divinity
i
should
make
up
my
mind
to
believe
nothing
of
it
if
i
saw
everywhere
the
marks
of
a
creator
i
should
rest
in
peace
in
faith
but
seeing
too
much
to
deny
and
too
little
to
affirm
i
am
in
a
pitiable
state
where
i
have
an
hundred
times
wishes
that
if
a
god
supports
nature
she
would
show
it
without
equivocation
and
that
if
the
marks
she
gives
are
deceptive
she
would
suppress
them
wholly
that
she
say
all
of
nothing
that
i
may
see
my
path
this
is
the
true
prometheus
lyric
but
when
put
back
in
its
place
it
refuses
to
rest
at
which
has
a
right
to
nothing
but
precision
it
has
but
one
real
home
the
the
mind
that
recoils
from
itself
can
only
commit
a
sort
of
ecstatic
suicide
it
must
absorb
itself
in
god
and
in
the
bankruptcy
of
science
the
western
christian
seemed
actually
on
the
point
of
attainment
he
like
pascal
touched
god
behind
the
veil
of
scepticism
the
schools
had
already
proved
one
or
two
points
which
need
never
have
been
discussed
again
in
essence
religion
was
love
in
no
case
was
it
logic
reason
can
reach
nothing
except
through
the
senses
god
by
essence
can
not
be
reached
through
the
senses
if
he
is
to
be
known
at
all
he
must
be
known
by
contact
of
spirit
with
spirit
essence
with
essence
directly
by
emotion
by
ecstasy
by
absorption
of
our
existence
in
his
by
substitution
of
his
spirit
for
ours
the
world
had
no
need
to
wait
five
hundred
years
longer
in
order
to
hear
this
same
result
reaffirmed
by
pascal
saint
francis
of
assisi
had
affirmed
it
loudly
enough
even
if
the
voice
of
saint
bernard
had
been
less
powerful
than
it
was
the
virgin
had
asserted
it
in
tones
more
gentle
but
any
one
may
still
see
how
convincing
who
stops
a
moment
to
feel
the
emotion
that
lifted
her
wonderful
chartres
spire
up
to
god
the
virgin
indeed
made
all
easy
for
it
was
little
enough
she
cared
for
reason
or
logic
she
cared
for
her
baby
a
simple
matter
which
any
woman
could
do
and
understand
that
and
the
grace
of
god
had
made
her
queen
of
heaven
the
trinity
had
its
source
in
her
totius
trinitatis
nobile
triclinium
and
she
was
maternity
she
was
also
poetry
and
art
in
the
bankruptcy
of
reason
she
alone
was
real
so
guillaume
de
champeaux
half
a
century
dead
came
to
life
again
in
another
of
his
creations
his
own
abbey
of
where
abelard
had
carried
on
imaginary
disputes
with
him
became
the
dominant
school
as
far
as
concerns
its
logic
we
had
best
pass
it
by
the
victorians
needed
logic
only
to
drive
away
logicians
which
was
hardly
necessary
after
bernard
had
shut
up
the
schools
as
for
its
mysticism
all
training
is
much
alike
in
idea
whether
one
follows
the
six
degrees
of
contemplation
taught
by
richard
of
victor
or
the
eightfold
noble
way
taught
by
gautama
buddha
the
theology
of
the
school
was
still
less
important
for
the
victorians
contented
themselves
with
orthodoxy
only
in
the
sense
of
caring
as
little
for
dogma
as
for
dialectics
their
thoughts
were
fixed
on
higher
emotions
not
richard
the
teacher
but
adam
the
poet
represents
the
school
to
us
and
when
adam
dealt
with
dogma
he
frankly
admitted
his
ignorance
and
hinted
his
indifference
he
was
as
always
conscientious
but
he
was
not
always
or
often
as
cold
his
statement
of
the
trinity
is
a
marvel
but
two
verses
of
it
are
enough
digne

ecclesia
of
the

to

leads
to
license
or
to
treason
punishment
deserving
what
is
birth
and
what
procession
is
not
mine
to
make

save
with
faith
unswerving
thus
professing
thus
believing
never
insolently
leaving
the
highway
of
our
faith
duty
weighing
law
obeying
never
shall
we
wander
straying
where
heresy
is
death
such
a
school
took
natural
refuge
in
the
holy
ghost
and
the
virgin
grace
and
love
but
the
holy
ghost
as
usual
profited
by
it
much
less
than
the
virgin
comparatively
little
of
adam
poetry
is
expressly
given
to
the
saint
esprit
and
too
large
a
part
of
this
has
a
certain
flavour
of
dogma
qui
procedis
ab
utroque
genitore
genitoque
pariter
paraclite
amor
patris
filiique
par
amborum
et
utrique
compar
et
consimilis
the
holy
ghost
is
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
neither
made
nor
created
nor
begotten
but
proceeding
the
whole
three
persons
are
coeternal
together
and
coequal
this
sounds
like
a
mere
versification
of
the
creed
yet
when
adam
ceased
to
be
dogmatic
and
broke
into
true
prayer
his
verse
added
a
lofty
beauty
even
to
the
holy
ghost
a
beauty
too
serious
for
modern
rhyme

adam
scholasticism
was
the
most
sympathetic
form
of
mediaeval
philosophy
even
in
prose
the
greatest
writers
have
not
often
succeeded
in
stating
simply
and
clearly
the
fact
that
infinity
can
make
itself
finite
or
that
space
can
make
itself
bounds
or
that
eternity
can
generate
time
in
verse
adam
did
it
as
easily
as
though
he
were
writing
any
other
miracle
as
gaultier
de
coincy
told
the
virgin
and
any
one
who
thinks
that
the
task
was
as
easy
as
it
seems
has
only
to
try
it
and
see
whether
he
can
render
into
a
modern
tongue
any
single
word
which
shall
retain
the
whole
value
of
the
word
which
adam
has
chosen

the
english
verses
compared
with
the
latin
are
poor
enough
with
the
canting
jingle
of
a
cheap
religion
and
a
thin
philosophy
but
by
contrast
and
comparison
they
give
higher
value
to
the
latin
one
feels
the
dignity
and
religious
quality
of
adam
chants
the
better
for
trying
to
give
them
an
equivalent
one
would
not
care
to
hazard
such
experiments
on
poetry
of
the
highest
class
like
that
of
dante
and
petrarch
but
adam
was
conventional
both
in
verse
and
thought
and
aimed
at
obtaining
his
effects
from
the
skilful
use
of
the
latin
sonorities
for
the
purposes
of
the
chant
with
dogma
and
metaphysics
he
dealt
boldly
and
even
baldly
as
he
was
required
to
do
and
successfully
as
far
as
concerned
the
ear
or
the
voice
but
poetry
was
hardly
made
for
dogma
even
the
trinity
was
better
expressed
mathematically
than
by
rhythm
with
the
stronger
emotions
such
as
terror
adam
was
still
conventional
and
showed
that
he
thought
of
the
chant
more
than
of
the
feeling
and
exaggerated
the
sound
beyond
the
value
of
the
sense
he
could
never
have
written
the
dies
irae
he
described
the
shipwreck
of
the
soul
in
magnificent
sounds
without
rousing
an
emotion
of
fear
the
raging
waves
and
winds
that
swept
his
bark
past
the
abysses
and
up
to
the
sky
were
as
conventional
as
the
sirens
the
dragons
the
dogs
and
the
pirates
that
lay
in
wait
the
mast
nodded
as
usual
the
sails
were
rent
the
sailors
ceased
work
all
the
machinery
was
classical
only
the
prayer
to
the
virgin
saved
the
poetry
from
sinking
like
the
ship
and
yet
when
chanted
the
effect
was
much
too
fine
to
bear
translation

the

at

the

no
use

to
give
a
higher
value
to
their
images
of
love
the
figures
on
the
west
portal
of
chartres
are
alive
with
the
spirit
of
adam
poetry
but
it
is
the
spirit
of
the
virgin
like
saint
bernard
adam
lavished
his
affections
on
mary
and
even
more
than
saint
bernard
he
could
claim
to
be
her
bernard
was
not
himself
author
of
the
hymn
stella
maris
which
brought
him
the
honour
of
the
virgin
personal
recognition
but
adam
was
author
of
a
dozen
hymns
in
which
her
perfections
were
told
with
equal
fervour
and
which
were
sung
at
her
festivals
among
these
was
the
famous
salve
mater
pietatis
et
totius
trinitatis
nobile
triclinium
a
compliment
so
refined
and
yet
so
excessive
that
the
venerable
thomas
cantimpratensis
who
died
a
century
later
about
related
in
his
apiarium
that
when
venerabilis
adam
wrote
down
these
lines
mary
herself
appeared
to
him
and
bent
her
head
in
recognition
although
the
manuscripts
do
not
expressly
mention
this
miracle
they
do
contain
at
that
stanza
a
curious
note
expressing
an
opinion
apparently
authorized
by
the
prior
that
if
the
virgin
had
seen
fit
to
recognize
the
salutation
of
the
venerable
adam
in
this
manner
she
would
have
done
only
what
he
merited
ab
ea
resalutari
et
regratiari
meruit
adam
poems
are
still
on
the
shelves
of
most
parisian
bookshops
as
common
as
aucassins
and
better
known
than
much
poetry
of
our
own
time
for
the
mediaeval
latin
rhymes
have
a
delightful
sonority
and
simplicity
that
keep
them
popular
because
they
were
not
made
to
be
read
but
to
be
sung
one
does
not
forget
their
swing
infinitus
et
immensus

oh

the
organ
rolls
through
them
as
solemnly
as
ever
it
did
in
the
abbey
church
but
in
mediaeval
art
so
much
more
depends
on
the
mass
than
on
the
measure
on
the
dignity
than
on
the
detail
that
equivalents
are
impossible
even
walter
scott
was
content
to
translate
only
three
verses
of
the
dies
irae
at
best
could
reproduce
only
a
sort
of
modern
gothic
a
more
or
less
effaced
or
affected
echo
of
a
lost
emotion
which
the
world
never
felt
but
once
and
never
could
feel
again
adam
composed
a
number
of
hymns
to
the
virgin
and
in
them
all
the
feeling
counts
for
more
by
far
than
the
sense
supposing
we
choose
the
simplest
and
try
to
give
it
a
modern
version
aiming
to
show
by
comparison
the
difference
of
sound
one
can
perhaps
manage
to
recover
a
little
of
the
simplicity
but
give
it
the
grand
style
one
can
not
or
at
least
if
any
one
has
ever
done
both
it
is
walter
scott
and
merely
by
placing
side
by
side
the
dies
irae
and
his
translation
of
it
one
can
see
at
a
glance
where
he
was
obliged
to
sacrifice
simplicity
only
to
obtain
sound

does

he
thought
them
or
himself
important

yet
if
it

to

it
must
separate

the
human
soul
was
an
atom
that
could
unite
with
god
only
as
a
simple
element
the
french
mystics
showed
in
their
mysticism
the
same
french
reasonableness
the
sense
of
measure
of
logic
of
science
the
allegiance
to
form
the
transparency
of
thought
which
the
french
mind
has
always
shown
on
its
surface
like
a
shell
of
nacre
the
mystics
were
in
substance
rather
more
logical
than
the
schoolmen
and
much
more
artistic
in
their
correctness
of
line
and
scale
at
bottom
french
saints
were
not
extravagant
one
can
imagine
a
byzantine
asserting
that
no
french
saint
was
ever
quite
saintly
their
aims
and
ideals
were
very
high
but
not
beyond
reaching
and
not
unreasonable
drag
the
french
mind
as
far
from
line
and
logic
as
space
permits
the
instant
it
is
freed
it
springs
back
to
the
classic
and
tries
to
look
consequent
this
paradox
that
the
french
mystics
were
never
mystical
runs
through
all
our
travels
so
obstinately
recurring
in
architecture
sculpture
legend
philosophy
religion
and
poetry
that
it
becomes
tiresome
and
yet
it
is
an
idea
that
in
spite
of
matthew
arnold
and
many
other
great
critics
never
has
got
lodgment
in
the
english
or
german
mind
and
probably
never
will
every
one
who
loves
travel
will
hope
that
it
never
may
if
you
are
driven
to
notice
it
as
the
most
distinctive
mark
of
french
art
it
is
not
at
all
for
the
purpose
of
arguing
a
doubtful
law
but
only
in
order
to
widen
the
amusement
of
travel
we
set
out
to
travel
from
to
chartres
and
no
farther
there
we
stop
but
we
may
still
look
across
the
boundary
to
assisi
for
a
specimen
of
italian
gothic
architecture
a
scheme
of
colour
decoration
or
still
better
for
a
mystic
to
compare
with
the
bernadines
and
victorians
every
one
who
knows
anything
of
religion
knows
that
the
ideal
mystic
saint
of
western
europe
was
francis
of
assisi
and
that
francis
though
he
loved
france
was
as
far
as
possible
from
being
french
though
not
in
the
least
french
he
was
still
the
finest
flower
from
the
french
mediaeval
garden
and
though
the
french
mystics
could
never
have
understood
him
he
was
what
the
french
mystics
would
have
liked
to
be
or
would
have
thought
they
liked
to
be
as
long
as
they
knew
him
to
be
not
one
of
themselves
as
an
italian
or
as
a
spaniard
francis
was
in
harmony
with
his
world
as
a
frenchman
he
would
have
been
out
of
place
even
at
clairvaux
and
still
more
among
his
own
cordeliers
at
the
doors
of
the
sorbonne
francis
was
born
in
at
the
instant
when
french
art
was
culminating
or
about
to
culminate
in
the
new
cathedrals
of
laon
and
chartres
on
the
ruins
of
scholastic
religion
and
in
the
full
summer
of
the
courts
of
love
he
died
in
just
as
queen
blanche
became
regent
of
france
and
when
the
cathedral
of
beauvais
was
planned
his
life
precisely
covered
the
most
perfect
moment
of
art
and
feeling
in
the
thousand
years
of
pure
and
confident
christianity
to
an
emotional
nature
like
his
life
was
still
a
phantasm
or
concept
of
crusade
against
real
or
imaginary
enemies
of
god
with
the
chanson
de
roland
for
a
sort
of
evangel
and
a
feminine
ideal
for
a
passion
he
chose
for
his
mistress
domina
nostra
paupertas
and
the
rules
of
his
order
of
knighthood
were
as
visionary
as
those
of
saint
bernard
were
practical
isti
sunt
fratres
mei
milites
tabulae
rotundae
qui
latitant
in
desertis
his
knights
of
the
round
table
hid
themselves
for
their
training
in
deserts
of
poverty
simplicity
humility
innocence
of
self
absorption
in
nature
in
the
silence
of
god
and
above
all
in
love
and
joy
incarnate
whose
only
influence
was
example
poverty
of
body
in
itself
mattered
nothing
what
francis
wanted
was
poverty
of
pride
and
the
external
robe
or
the
bare
feet
were
outward
and
necessary
forms
of
protection
against
its
outward
display
against
riches
or
against
all
external
and
visible
vanity
rules
and
laws
could
be
easily
enforced
if
it
were
worth
while
although
the
purest
humility
would
be
reached
only
by
those
who
were
indifferent
and
unconscious
of
their
external
dress
but
against
spiritual
pride
the
soul
is
defenceless
and
of
all
its
forms
the
subtlest
and
the
meanest
is
pride
of
intellect
if
nostra
domina
paupertas
had
a
mortal
enemy
it
was
not
the
pride
beneath
a
scarlet
robe
but
that
in
a
schoolmaster
ferule
and
of
all
schoolmasters
the
vainest
and
most
pretentious
was
the
scholastic
philosopher
satan
was
logic
lord
bacon
held
much
the
same
opinion
i
reject
the
syllogism
was
the
of
his
teaching
as
it
was
the
essence
of
saint
francis
and
the
reasons
of
both
men
were
the
same
though
their
action
was
opposite
let
men
please
themselves
as
they
will
in
admiring
and
almost
adoring
the
human
mind
this
is
certain
that
as
an
uneven
mirror
distorts
the
rays
of
objects
according
to
its
own
figure
and
section
so
the
mind
can
not
be
trusted
bacon
first
object
was
the
same
as
that
of
francis
to
humiliate
and
if
possible
destroy
the
pride
of
human
reason
both
of
them
knew
that
this
was
their
most
difficult
task
and
francis
who
was
charity
incarnate
lost
his
whenever
he
spoke
of
the
schools
and
became
almost
bitter
as
though
in
constant
terror
of
a
poison
or
a
cancer
praeodorabat
etiam
tempora
non
longe
ventura
in
quibus
jam
praesciebat
scientiam
inflativam
debere
esse
occasionem
ruinae
he
foresaw
the
time
not
far
off
when
science
would
be
the
ruin
of
his
domina
paupertas
his
struggle
with
this
form
of
human
pride
was
desperate
and
tragical
in
its
instant
failure
he
could
not
make
even
his
novices
understand
what
he
meant
the
most
impossible
task
of
the
mind
is
to
reject
in
practice
the
reflex
action
of
itself
as
bacon
pointed
out
and
only
the
highest
training
has
sometimes
partially
succeeded
in
doing
it
the
schools
ancient
mediaeval
or
modern
have
almost
equally
failed
but
even
the
simple
rustics
who
tried
to
follow
francis
could
not
see
why
the
rule
of
poverty
should
extend
to
the
use
of
a
psalter
over
and
over
again
he
explained
vehemently
and
dramatically
as
only
an
italian
or
a
spaniard
could
and
still
they
failed
to
catch
a
notion
of
what
he
meant

so
when
saint
francis
happened
to
come
to
the
place
where
the
novice
was
the
novice
said
father
it
would
be
a
great
comfort
to
me
to
have
a
psalter
but
though
my
general
should
grant
it
still
i
would
rather
have
it
father
with
your
knowledge
too
saint
francis
answered
the
emperor
charlemagne
roland
and
oliver
and
all
the
palatines
and
strong
men
who
were
potent
in
battle
pursuing
the
infidels
with
much
toil
and
sweat
even
to
death
triumphed
over
them
memorably
without
writing
it
and
at
last
these
holy
martyrs
died
in
the
contest
for
the
faith
of
christ
but
now
there
are
many
who
merely
by
telling
of
what
those
men
did
want
to
receive
honour
and
human
praise
so
too
among
us
are
many
who
merely
by
reciting
and
preaching
the
works
which
the
saints
have
done
want
to
receive
honour
and
praise
after
you
have
got
the
psalter
you
will
covet
and
want
a
breviary
and
after
getting
the
breviary
you
will
sit
on
your
throne
like
a
bishop
and
will
say
to
your
brother
me
the
breviary
while
saying
this
saint
francis
with
great
vehemence
took
up
a
handful
of
ashes
and
spread
it
over
his
bead
and
moving
his
hand
about
his
head
in
a
circle
as
though
washing
it
said
i
breviary
i
breviary
and
so
kept
on
repeatedly
moving
his
hand
about
his
head
and
stupefied
and
ashamed
was
that
novice
but
several
months
afterwards
when
saint
francis
happened
to
be
near
sta
maria
de
portiuncula
by
the
cell
behind
the
house
on
the
road
the
same
brother
again
spoke
to
him
about
the
psalter
saint
francis
replied
go
and
do
about
it
as
your
director
says
on
this
the
brother
turned
back
but
saint
francis
standing
in
the
road
began
to
reflect
on
what
he
had
said
and
suddenly
called
after
him
wait
for
me
brother
wait
and
going
after
him
said
return
with
me
brother
and
show
me
the
place
where
i
told
you
to
do
as
your
director
should
say
about
the
psalter
when
they
had
come
back
to
it
saint
francis
bent
before
the
brother
and
said
mea
culpa
brother
mea
culpa
because
whoever
wishes
to
be
a
minorite
must
have
nothing
but
a
tunic
as
the
rule
permits
and
the
cord
and
the
loincloth
and
what
covering
is
manifestly
necessary
for
the
limbs
so
vivid
a
picture
of
an
actual
mediaeval
saint
stands
out
upon
this
simple
background
as
is
hardly
to
be
found
elsewhere
in
all
the
records
of
centuries
but
if
the
brother
himself
did
not
understand
it
and
was
so
shamed
and
stupefied
by
francis
vehemence
the
world
could
understand
it
no
better
the
order
itself
was
ashamed
of
saint
francis
because
they
understood
him
too
well
they
hastened
to
suppress
this
teaching
against
science
although
it
was
the
life
of
francis
doctrine
he
taught
that
the
science
of
the
schools
led
to
perdition
because
it
was
puffed
up
with
emptiness
and
pride
humility
simplicity
poverty
were
alone
true
science
they
alone
led
to
heaven
before
the
tribunal
of
christ
the
schoolmen
would
be
condemned
and
with
their
dark
logic
opinionibus
tenebrosis
shall
be
plunged
into
outer
darkness
with
the
spirits
of
the
darkness
they
were
devilish
and
would
perish
with
the
devils
one
sees
instantly
that
neither
francis
of
assisi
nor
bacon
of
verulam
could
have
hoped
for
peace
with
the
schools
ecstasy
felt
the
futility
of
mere
rhetoric
quite
as
keenly
as
scepticism
was
to
feel
it
and
yet
when
francis
died
in
at
assisi
thomas
was
just
being
born
at
aquino
some
two
hundred
kilometres
to
the
southward
true
scholasticism
had
not
begun
four
hundred
years
seem
long
for
the
human
mind
to
stand
still
or
go
backward
the
more
because
the
human
mind
was
never
better
satisfied
with
itself
than
when
thus
absorbed
in
its
mirror
but
with
that
chapter
we
have
nothing
to
do
the
pleasantest
way
to
treat
it
was
that
of
saint
francis
as
though
after
all
in
the
thought
of
infinity
four
hundred
years
were
at
most
only
a
interlude
at
assisi
once
when
a
theologian
attacked
fra
egidio
by
the
usual
formal
arraignment
in
syllogisms
the
brother
waited
until
the
conclusions
were
laid
down
and
then
taking
out
a
flute
from
the
folds
of
his
robe
he
played
his
answer
in
rustic
melodies
the
soul
of
saint
francis
was
a
rustic
melody
and
the
simplest
that
ever
reached
so
high
an
expression
compared
with
it
theocritus
and
virgil
are
as
modern
as
tennyson
and
ourselves
all
this
shows
only
what
saint
francis
was
not
to
understand
what
he
was
and
how
he
goes
with
saint
bernard
and
saint
victor
through
the
religious
idyll
of
transition
architecture
one
must
wander
about
assisi
with
the
floretum
or
fioretti
in
one
hand
the
legends
which
are
the
gospel
of
francis
as
the
evangels
are
the
gospel
of
christ
who
was
reincarnated
in
assisi
we
have
given
a
deal
of
time
to
showing
our
own
sceptical
natures
how
simple
the
architects
and
decorators
of
chartres
were
in
their
notions
of
the
virgin
and
her
wants
but
french
was
already
complex
compared
with
italian
the
virgin
was
human
francis
was
elementary
nature
itself
like
sun
and
air
he
was
greek
in
his
joy
of
life

he
departed
thence
and
came
between
cannara
and
bevagna
and
near
the
road
he
saw
some
trees
on
which
perched
so
great
a
number
of
birds
as
never
in
those
parts
had
been
seen
the
like
also
in
the
field
beyond
near
these
same
trees
a
very
great
multitude
rested
on
the
ground
this
multitude
saint
francis
seeing
with
wonder
the
spirit
of
god
descending
on
him
he
said
to
his
companions
wait
for
me
on
the
road
while
i
go
and
preach
to
our
sisters
the
little
birds
and
he
went
into
the
field
where
the
birds
were
on
the
ground
and
as
soon
as
he
began
to
preach
all
the
birds
in
the
trees
came
down
to
him
and
with
those
in
the
field
stood
quite
still
even
when
he
went
among
them
touching
many
with
his
robe
not
one
of
them
moved
as
brother
james
of
massa
related
a
saintly
man
who
had
the
whole
story
from
the
mouth
of
brother
masseo
who
was
one
of
those
then
with
the
sainted
father
to
these
birds
saint
francis
said
much
are
you
bound
to
god
birds
my
sisters
and
everywhere
and
always
must
you
praise
him
for
the
free
flight
you
everywhere
have
for
the
double
and
triple
covering
for
the
painted
and
decorated
robe
for
the
food
prepared
without
your
labour
for
the
song
taught
you
by
the
creator
for
your
number
multiplied
by
blessing
for
your
seed
preserved
by
god
in
the
ark
for
the
element
of
air
allotted
to
you
you
neither
sow
nor
reap
and
god
feeds
you
and
has
given
you
rivers
and
springs
to
drink
at
mountains
and
hills
rocks
and
wild
goats
for
refuge
and
high
trees
for
nesting
and
though
you
know
neither
how
to
spin
nor
to
weave
he
gives
both
you
and
your
children
all
the
garments
you
need
whence
much
must
the
creator
love
you
who
confers
so
many
blessings
therefore
take
care
my
small
bird
sisters
never
to
be
ungrateful
but
always
strive
to
praise
god
fra
ugolino
or
whoever
wrote
from
the
dictation
of
brother
james
of
massa
after
the
tradition
of
brother
masseo
of
marignano
reported
saint
francis
sermon
in
absolute
good
faith
as
saint
francis
probably
made
it
and
as
the
birds
possibly
received
it
all
were
god
creatures
brothers
and
sisters
and
god
alone
knew
or
knows
whether
or
how
far
they
understand
each
other
but
saint
francis
in
any
case
understood
them
and
believed
that
they
were
in
sympathy
with
him
as
far
as
the
birds
or
wolves
were
concerned
it
was
no
great
matter
but
francis
did
not
stop
with
vertebrates
or
even
with
organic
forms
nor
was
it
surprising
said
the
speculum
if
fire
and
other
creatures
sometimes
revered
and
obeyed
him
for
as
we
who
were
with
him
very
frequently
saw
he
held
them
in
such
affection
and
so
much
delighted
in
them
and
his
soul
was
moved
by
such
pity
and
compassion
for
them
that
he
would
not
see
them
roughly
handled
and
talked
with
them
with
such
evident
delight
as
if
they
were
rational
beings

creatura
for
once
when
he
was
sitting
by
the
fire
a
spark
without
his
knowing
it
caught
his
linen
drawers
and
set
them
burning
near
the
knee
and
when
he
felt
the
heat
he
would
not
extinguish
it
but
his
companion
seeing
his
clothes
on
fire
ran
to
put
it
out
and
he
forbade
it
saying
do
my
dearest
brother
do
hurt
the
fire
so
he
utterly
refused
to
let
him
put
it
out
and
the
brother
hurried
off
to
get
his
guardian
and
brought
him
to
saint
francis
and
together
they
put
out
the
fire
at
once
against
saint
will
so
no
matter
what
the
necessity
he
would
never
put
out
fire
or
a
lamp
or
candle
so
strong
was
his
feeling
for
it
he
would
not
even
let
a
brother
throw
fire
or
a
smoking
log
from
place
to
place
as
is
usual
but
wanted
it
placed
gently
piano
on
the
ground
out
of
respect
for
him
whose
creature
it
is
the
modern
tourist
having
with
difficulty
satisfied
himself
that
saint
francis
acted
thus
in
good
faith
immediately
exclaims
that
he
was
a
heretic
and
should
have
been
burned
but
in
truth
the
immense
popular
charm
of
saint
francis
as
of
the
virgin
was
precisely
his
heresies
both
were
illogical
and
heretical
by
essence
in
strict
discipline
in
the
days
of
the
holy
office
a
hundred
years
later
both
would
have
been
burned
by
the
church
as
jeanne
was
with
infinitely
less
reason
in
the
charm
of
the
church
was
that
it
knew
how
to
be
illogical
no
great
moral
authority
ever
knew
it
better
when
god
himself
became
illogical
it
cared
no
more
than
saint
francis
or
lord
bacon
for
the
syllogism
nothing
in
art
is
so
fine
as
the
air
and
gesture
of
sympathetic
majesty
with
which
the
church
drew
aside
to
let
the
virgin
and
saint
francis
pass
and
take
the
lead
for
a
time
both
were
human
ideals
too
intensely
realized
to
be
resisted
merely
because
they
were
illogical
the
church
bowed
and
was
silent
this
does
not
concern
us
what
the
church
thought
or
thinks
is
its
own
affair
and
what
it
chooses
to
call
orthodox
is
orthodox
we
have
been
trying
only
to
understand
what
the
virgin
and
saint
francis
thought
which
is
matter
of
fact
not
of
faith
saint
francis
was
even
more
outspoken
than
the
virgin
she
calmly
set
herself
above
dogma
and
with
feminine
indifference
to
authority
overruled
it
he
having
asserted
in
the
strongest
terms
the
principle
of
obedience
paid
no
further
attention
to
dogma
but
without
the
least
reticence
insisted
on
practices
and
ideas
that
no
church
could
possibly
permit
or
avow
toward
the
end
of
his
life
his
physician
cauterized
his
face
for
some
neuralgic
pain

when
the
iron
was
put
on
the
fire
for
making
the
cotterie
saint
francis
wishing
to
encourage
himself
against
fear
spoke
thus
to
the
fire
my
brother
fire
noblest
and
usefullest
of
creatures
be
gentle
to
me
now
because
i
have
loved
and
will
love
you
with
the
love
of
him
who
created
you
our
creator
too
who
created
us
both
i
implore
so
to
temper
your
heat
that
i
may
have
strength
to
bear
it
and
having
spoken
he
signed
the
fire
with
the
cross
with
him
this
was
not
merely
a
symbol
children
and
saints
can
believe
two
contrary
things
at
the
same
time
but
saint
francis
had
also
a
complete
faith
of
his
own
which
satisfied
him
wholly
all
nature
was
god
creature
the
sun
and
fire
air
and
water
were
neither
more
nor
less
brothers
and
sisters
than
sparrows
wolves
and
bandits
even
daemones
sunt

nostri
the
devils
are
wardens
of
our
lord
if
saint
francis
made
any
exception
from
his
univeral
law
of
brotherhood
it
was
that
of
the
schoolmen
but
it
was
never
expressed
even
in
his
passionate
outbreak
in
the
presence
of
saint
dominic
at
the
great
chapter
of
his
order
at
sancta
maria
de
portiuncula
in
he
did
not
go
quite
to
the
length
of
denying
the
brotherhood
of
schoolmen
although
he
placed
them
far
below
the
devils
and
yet
every
word
of
this
address
seems
to
sob
with
the
anguish
of
his
despair
at
the
power
of
the
school
quum
beatus

esset

when
saint
francis
was
at
the
general
chapter
held
at
sancta
maris
de
portiuncula
and
five
thousand
brothers
were
present
a
number
of
them
who
were
schoolmen
went
to
cardinal
hugolino
who
was
there
and
said
to
him
my
lord
we
want
you
to
persuade
brother
francis
to
follow
the
council
of
the
learned
brothers
and
sometimes
let
himself
be
guided
by
them
and
they
suggested
the
rule
of
saint
benedict
or
augustine
or
bernard
who
require
their
congregations
to
live
so
and
so
by
regulation
when
the
cardinal
had
repeated
all
this
to
saint
francis
by
way
of
counsel
saint
francis
making
no
answer
took
him
by
the
hand
and
led
him
to
the
brothers
assembled
in
chapter
and
in
the
fervour
and
virtue
of
the
holy
ghost
spoke
thus
to
the
brothers
my
brothers
my
brothers
god
has
called
me
by
way
of
simplicity
and
humility
and
has
shown
me
in
verity
this
path
for
me
and
those
who
want
to
believe
and
follow
me
so
i
want
you
to
talk
of
no
rule
to
me
neither
saint
benedict
nor
saint
augustine
nor
saint
bernard
nor
any
way
or
form
of
life
whatever
except
that
which
god
has
mercifully
pointed
out
and
granted
to
me
and
god
said
that
he
wanted
me
to
be
a
pauper
poverello
and
an
idiot
a
great
fool
in
this
world
and
would
not
lead
us
by
any
other
path
of
science
than
this
but
by
your
science
and
syllogisms
god
will
confound
you
and
i
trust
in
god
warders
the
devils
that
through
them
god
shall
punish
you
and
you
will
yet
come
back
to
your
proper
station
with
shame
whether
you
will
or
no
the
narration
continues
tunc

one
feels
that
the
reporter
has
not
exaggerated
a
word
on
the
contrary
he
softened
the
scandal
because
in
his
time
the
cardinal
had
gained
his
point
and
francis
was
dead
one
can
hear
francis
beginning
with
some
restraint
and
gradually
carried
away
by
passion
till
he
lost
control
of
himself
and
his
language
told
me
with
his
own
words
that
he
meant
me
to
be
a
beggar
and
a
great
fool
and
would
not
have
us
on
any
other
terms
and
as
for
your
science
i
trust
in
god
devils
who
will
beat
you
out
of
it
as
you
deserve
and
the
cardinal
was
utterly
dumbfounded
and
answered
nothing
and
all
the
brothers
were
scared
to
death
the
cardinal
hugolino
was
a
great
schoolman
and
dominic
was
then
founding
the
famous
order
in
which
the
greatest
of
all
doctors
albertus
magnus
was
about
to
begin
his
studies
one
can
imagine
that
the
cardinal
obstupuit
valde
and
that
dominic
felt
shaken
in
his
scheme
of
school
instruction
for
a
single
instant
in
the
flash
of
passion
the
whole
mass
of
five
thousand
monks
in
a
state
of
ecstasy
recoiled
before
the
impassable
gulf
that
opened
between
them
and
the
church
no
one
was
to
blame
no
one
ever
is
to
blame
because
god
wanted
contradictory
things
and
man
tried
to
carry
out
as
he
saw
them
god
trusts
the
schoolmen
saw
their
duty
in
one
direction
francis
saw
his
in
another
and
apparently
when
both
lines
had
been
carried
after
such
fashion
as
might
be
to
their
utmost
results
and
five
hundred
years
had
been
devoted
to
the
effort
society
declared
both
to
be
failures
perhaps
both
may
some
day
be
revived
for
the
two
paths
seem
to
be
the
only
roads
that
can
exist
if
man
starts
by
taking
for
granted
that
there
is
an
object
to
be
reached
at
the
end
of
his
journey
the
church
embracing
all
mankind
had
no
choice
but
to
march
with
caution
seeking
god
by
every
possible
means
of
intellect
and
study
francis
acting
only
for
himself
could
throw
caution
aside
and
trust
implicitly
in
god
like
the
children
who
went
on
crusade
the
two
poles
of
social
and
political
philosophy
seem
necessarily
to
be
organization
or
anarchy
intellect
or
the
forces
of
nature
francis
saw
god
in
nature
if
he
did
not
see
nature
in
god
as
the
builders
of
chartres
saw
the
virgin
in
their
apse
francis
held
the
simplest
and
most
childlike
form
of
pantheism
he
carried
to
its
last
point
the
mystical
union
with
god
and
its
necessary
consequence
of
contempt
and
hatred
for
human
intellectual
processes
even
saint
bernard
would
have
thought
his
ideas
wanting
in
that
mesure
which
the
french
mind
so
much
prizes
at
the
same
time
we
had
best
try
as
innocently
as
may
be
to
realize
that
no
final
judgment
has
yet
been
pronounced
either
by
the
church
or
by
society
or
by
science
on
either
or
any
of
these
points
and
until
mankind
finally
settles
to
a
certainty
where
it
means
to
go
or
whether
it
means
to
go
anywhere
what
its
object
is
or
whether
it
has
an
object
saint
francis
may
still
prove
to
have
been
its
ultimate
expression
in
that
case
his
famous
chant
the
cantico
del
sole
will
be
the
last
word
of
religion
as
it
was
probably
its
first
here
it
is
too
sincere
for
translation

the
verses
if
verses
they
are
have
little
or
nothing
in
common
with
the
art
of
saint
bernard
or
adam
of
whatever
art
they
have
granting
that
they
have
any
seems
to
go
back
to
the
and
the
age
of
stone
compared
with
the
naivete
of
the
cantico
del
sole
the
chanson
de
roland
or
the
iliad
is
a
triumph
of
perfect
technique
the
value
is
not
in
the
verse
the
chant
of
the
sun
is
another
pons
seclorum
or
perhaps
rather
a
pons
sanctorum
over
which
only
children
and
saints
can
pass
it
is
almost
a
paraphrase
of
the
sermon
to
the
birds
thank
you
mi
signore
for
messor
brother
sun
in
especial
who
is
your
symbol
and
for
sister
moon
and
the
stars
and
for
brother
wind
and
air
and
sky
and
for
sister
water
and
for
brother
fire
and
for
mother
earth
we
are
all
yours
mi
signore
we
are
your
children
your
household
your
feudal
family
but
we
never
heard
of
a
church
we
are
all
varying
forms
of
the
same
ultimate
energy
shifting
symbols
of
the
same
absolute
unity
but
our
only
unity
beneath
you
is
nature
not
law
we
thank
you
for
no
human
institutions
even
for
those
established
in
your
name
but
with
all
our
hearts
we
thank
you
for
sister
our
mother
earth
and
its
fruits
and
coloured
flowers
francis
loved
them
all
the
brothers
and
sisters
as
intensely
as
a
child
loves
the
taste
and
smell
of
a
peach
and
as
simply
but
behind
them
remained
one
sister
whom
no
one
loved
and
for
whom
in
his
first
verses
francis
had
rendered
no
thanks
only
on
his
bed
he
added
the
lines
of
gratitude
for
our
sister
death
the
sister
of
the
schoolmen
who
solved
all
philosophy
and
merged
multiplicity
in
unity
the
solution
was
at
least
simple
one
must
decide
for
one
self
according
to
personal
standards
whether
or
not
it
is
more
sympathetic
than
that
with
which
we
have
got
lastly
to
grapple
in
the
works
of
saint
thomas
aquinas
chapter
xvi
saint
thomas
aquinas
long
before
saint
francis
death
in
the
french
mystics
had
exhausted
their
energies
and
the
siecle
had
taken
new
heart
society
could
not
remain
forever
balancing
between
thought
and
act
a
few
gifted
natures
could
absorb
themselves
in
the
absolute
but
the
rest
lived
for
the
day
and
needed
shelter
and
safety
so
the
church
bent
again
to
its
task
and
bade
the
spaniard
dominic
arm
new
levies
with
the
best
weapons
of
science
and
flaunt
the
name
of
aristotle
on
the
church
banners
along
with
that
of
saint
augustine
the
year
which
happened
to
be
the
date
of
magna
charta
and
other
easily
fixed
events
like
the
birth
of
saint
louis
may
serve
to
mark
the
triumph
of
the
schools
the
pointed
arch
revelled
at
rheims
and
the
gothic
architects
reached
perfection
at
amiens
just
as
francis
died
at
assisi
and
thomas
was
born
at
aquino
the
franciscan
order
itself
was
swept
with
the
stream
that
francis
tried
to
dam
and
the
great
franciscan
schoolman
alexander
hales
in
four
years
before
the
death
of
francis
joined
the
order
and
began
lecturing
as
though
francis
himself
had
lived
only
to
teach
scholastic
philosophy
the
rival
dominican
champion
albertus
magnus
began
his
career
a
little
later
in
born
of
the
noble
swabian
family
of
bollstadt
in
he
drifted
like
other
schoolmen
to
paris
and
the
rue
maitre
albert
opposite
notre
dame
still
records
his
fame
as
a
teacher
there
thence
he
passed
to
a
school
established
by
the
order
at
cologne
where
he
was
lecturing
with
great
authority
in
when
the
general
superior
of
the
order
brought
up
from
italy
a
young
man
of
the
highest
promise
to
be
trained
as
his
assistant
thomas
the
new
pupil
was
born
under
the
shadow
of
monte
cassino
in
or
his
father
the
count
of
aquino
claimed
descent
from
the
imperial
line
of
swabia
his
mother
from
the
norman
princes
of
sicily
so
that
in
him
the
two
most
energetic
strains
in
europe
met
his
social
rank
was
royal
and
the
order
set
the
highest
value
on
it
he
took
the
vows
in
and
went
north
at
once
to
help
albertus
at
cologne
in
the
order
sent
albertus
back
to
paris
and
thomas
with
him
there
he
remained
till
when
he
was
ordered
to
cologne
as
assistant
lecturer
and
only
four
years
afterwards
at
years
old
he
was
made
full
professor
at
paris
his
industry
and
activity
never
rested
till
his
death
in
not
yet
fifty
years
old
when
he
bequeathed
to
the
church
a
mass
of
manuscript
that
tourists
will
never
know
enough
to
estimate
except
by
weight
his
complete
works
repeatedly
printed
fill
between
twenty
and
thirty
quarto
volumes
for
so
famous
a
doctor
this
is
almost
meagre
unfortunately
his
greatest
work
the
summa
theologiae
is
unfinished
like
beauvais
cathedral
perhaps
thomas
success
was
partly
due
to
his
memory
which
is
said
to
have
been
phenomenal
for
in
an
age
when
cyclopaedias
were
unknown
a
cyclopaedic
memory
must
have
counted
for
half
the
battle
in
these
scholastic
disputes
where
authority
could
be
met
only
by
authority
but
in
this
case
memory
was
supported
by
mind
outwardly
thomas
was
heavy
and
slow
in
manner
if
it
is
true
that
his
companions
called
him
the
big
dumb
ox
of
sicily
and
in
fashionable
or
court
circles
he
did
not
enjoy
reputation
for
acute
sense
of
humour
saint
louis
household
offers
a
picture
not
wholly
clerical
least
of
all
among
the
king
brothers
and
sons
and
perhaps
the
was
not
much
more
used
then
than
now
to
abrupt
interjections
of
theology
into
the
talk
about
hunting
and
hounds
but
however
it
happened
thomas
one
day
surprised
the
company
by
solemnly
announcing
i
have
a
decisive
argument
against
the
manicheans
no
wit
or
humour
could
be
more
to
the
point
between
two
saints
that
were
to
be
than
a
decisive
argument
against
enemies
of
christ
and
one
greatly
regrets
that
the
rest
of
the
conversation
was
not
reported
unless
indeed
it
is
somewhere
in
the
quarto
volumes
but
it
probably
lacked
humour
for
courtiers
the
quarto
volumes
must
be
closed
books
for
us
none
but
dominicans
have
a
right
to
interpret
them
no
franciscan
or
even
jesuit
understands
saint
thomas
exactly
or
explains
him
with
authority
for
summer
tourists
to
handle
these
intricate
problems
in
a
theological
spirit
would
be
altogether
absurd
but
for
us
these
great
theologians
were
also
architects
who
undertook
to
build
a
church
intellectual
corresponding
bit
by
bit
to
the
church
administrative
both
expressing
and
expressed
by
the
church
architectural
alexander
hales
albert
the
great
thomas
aquinas
duns
scotus
and
the
rest
were
artists
and
if
saint
thomas
happens
to
stand
at
their
head
as
type
it
is
not
because
we
choose
him
or
understand
him
better
than
his
rivals
but
because
his
order
chose
him
rather
than
his
master
albert
to
impose
as
authority
on
the
church
and
because
pope
john
xxii
canonized
him
on
the
ground
that
his
decisions
were
miracles
and
because
the
council
of
trent
placed
his
summa
among
the
sacred
books
on
their
table
and
because
innocent
vi
said
that
his
doctrine
alone
was
sure
and
finally
because
leo
xiii
very
lately
made
a
point
of
declaring
that
on
the
wings
of
saint
thomas
genius
human
reason
has
reached
the
most
sublime
height
it
can
probably
ever
attain
although
the
franciscans
and
later
the
jesuits
have
not
always
shown
as
much
admiration
as
the
dominicans
for
the
genius
of
saint
thomas
and
the
mystics
have
never
shown
any
admiration
whatever
for
the
philosophy
of
the
schools
the
authority
of
leo
xiii
is
final
at
least
on
one
point
and
the
only
one
that
concerns
us
saint
thomas
is
still
alive
and
overshadows
as
many
schools
as
he
ever
did
at
all
events
as
many
as
the
church
maintains
he
has
outlived
descartes
and
leibnitz
and
a
dozen
other
schools
of
philosophy
more
or
less
serious
in
their
day
he
has
mostly
outlived
hume
voltaire
and
the
militant
sceptics
his
method
is
typical
and
classic
his
sentences
when
interpreted
by
the
church
seem
even
to
an
untrained
mind
intelligible
and
consistent
his
church
intellectual
remains
practically
unchanged
and
like
the
cathedral
of
beauvais
erect
although
the
storms
of
six
or
seven
centuries
have
prostrated
over
and
over
again
every
other
social
or
political
or
juristic
shelter
compared
with
it
all
modern
systems
are
complex
and
chaotic
crowded
with
anomalies
impracticable
functions
and
outworn
inheritances
but
beyond
all
their
practical
shortcomings
is
their
fragmentary
character
an
economic
civilization
troubles
itself
about
the
universe
much
as
a
hive
of
troubles
about
the
ocean
only
as
a
region
to
be
avoided
the
hive
of
saint
thomas
sheltered
god
and
man
mind
and
matter
the
universe
and
the
atom
the
one
and
the
multiple
within
the
walls
of
an
harmonious
home
theologians
like
architects
were
supposed
to
receive
their
church
complete
in
all
its
lines
they
were
modern
judges
who
interpreted
the
laws
but
never
invented
it
saint
thomas
merely
selected
between
disputed
opinions
but
he
allowed
himself
to
wander
very
far
afield
indeed
in
search
of
opinions
to
dispute
the
field
embraced
all
that
existed
or
might
have
existed
or
could
never
exist
the
immense
structure
rested
on
aristotle
and
saint
augustine
at
the
last
but
as
a
work
of
art
it
stood
alone
like
rheims
or
amiens
cathedral
as
though
it
had
no
antecedents
then
although
like
rheims
its
style
was
never
meant
to
suit
modern
housekeeping
and
is
by
the
ecole
des
beaux
arts
it
reveals
itself
in
its
great
mass
and
intelligence
as
a
work
of
extraordinary
genius
a
system
as
admirably
proportioned
as
any
cathedral
and
as
complete
a
success
not
universal
either
in
art
or
science
saint
thomas
architecture
like
any
other
work
of
art
is
best
studied
by
itself
as
though
he
created
it
outright
otherwise
a
tourist
would
never
get
beyond
its
threshold
beginning
with
the
foundation
which
is
god
and
god
active
presence
in
his
church
thomas
next
built
god
into
the
walls
and
towers
of
his
church
in
the
trinity
and
its
creation
of
mind
and
matter
in
time
and
space
then
finally
he
filled
the
church
by
uniting
mind
and
matter
in
man
or
man
soul
giving
to
humanity
a
free
will
that
rose
like
the
fleche
to
heaven
the
foundation
the
structure
the
congregation
are
enough
for
students
of
art
his
ideas
of
law
ethics
and
politics
his
vocabulary
his
syllogisms
his
arrangement
are
like
the
drawings
of
villard
de
honnecourt
curious
but
not
vital
after
the
romanesque
church
of
saint
michael
came
the
transition
church
of
the
virgin
and
all
merged
and
ended
at
last
in
the
gothic
cathedral
of
the
trinity
one
wants
to
see
the
end
the
foundation
of
the
christian
church
should
be
as
the
simple
deist
might
suppose
always
the
same
but
saint
thomas
knew
better
his
foundation
was
norman
not
french
it
spoke
the
practical
architect
who
knew
the
mathematics
of
his
art
and
who
saw
that
the
foundation
laid
by
saint
bernard
saint
victor
saint
francis
the
whole
mystical
cartesian
spinozan
foundation
past
or
future
could
not
bear
the
weight
of
the
structure
to
be
put
on
it
thomas
began
by
sweeping
the
ground
clear
of
them
god
must
be
a
concrete
thing
not
a
human
thought
god
must
be
proved
by
the
senses
like
any
other
concrete
thing
nihil
est
in
intellectu
quin
prius
fuerit
in
sensu
even
if
aristotle
had
not
affirmed
the
law
thomas
would
have
discovered
it
he
admitted
at
once
that
god
could
not
be
taken
for
granted
the
admission
as
every
of
the
latin
quarter
knew
was
exceedingly
bold
and
dangerous
the
greatest
logicians
commonly
shrank
from
proving
unity
by
multiplicity
thomas
was
one
of
the
greatest
logicians
that
ever
lived
the
question
had
always
been
at
the
bottom
of
theology
he
deliberately
challenged
what
every
one
knew
to
be
an
extreme
peril
if
his
foundation
failed
his
church
fell
many
critics
have
thought
that
he
saw
dangers
four
hundred
years
ahead
the
time
came
about
when
descartes
deserting
saint
thomas
started
afresh
with
the
idea
of
god
as
a
concept
and
at
once
found
himself
charged
with
a
deity
that
contained
the
universe
nor
did
the
cartesians
until
spinoza
made
it
clear
seem
able
or
willing
to
see
that
the
church
could
not
accept
this
deity
because
the
church
required
a
god
who
caused
the
universe
the
two
deities
destroyed
each
other
one
was
passive
the
other
active
thomas
warned
descartes
of
a
logical
quicksand
which
must
necessarily
swallow
up
any
church
and
which
spinoza
explored
to
the
bottom
thomas
said
truly
that
every
true
cause
must
be
proved
as
a
cause
not
merely
as
a
sequence
otherwise
they
must
end
in
a
universal
energy
or
substance
without
causality
a
source
whatever
god
might
be
to
others
to
his
church
he
could
not
be
a
sequence
or
a
source
that
point
had
been
admitted
by
william
of
champeaux
and
made
the
division
between
christians
and
infidels
on
the
other
hand
if
god
must
be
proved
as
a
true
cause
in
order
to
warrant
the
church
or
the
state
in
requiring
men
to
worship
him
as
creator
the
student
became
the
more
curious
if
a
churchman
the
more
anxious
to
be
assured
that
thomas
succeeded
in
his
proof
especially
since
he
did
not
satisfy
descartes
and
still
less
pascal
that
the
mystics
should
be
dissatisfied
was
natural
enough
since
they
were
committed
to
the
contrary
view
but
that
descartes
should
desert
was
a
serious
blow
which
threw
the
french
church
into
consternation
from
which
it
never
quite
recovered
i
see
motion
said
thomas
i
infer
a
motor
this
reasoning
which
may
be
fifty
thousand
years
old
is
as
strong
as
ever
it
was
stronger
than
some
more
modern
inferences
of
science
but
the
average
mechanic
stated
it
differently
i
see
motion
he
admitted
i
infer
energy
i
see
motion
everywhere
i
infer
energy
everywhere
saint
thomas
barred
this
door
to
materialism
by
adding
i
see
motion
i
can
not
infer
an
infinite
series
of
motors
i
can
only
infer
somewhere
at
the
end
of
the
series
an
intelligent
fixed
motor
the
average
modern
mechanic
might
not
dissent
but
would
certainly
hesitate
no
doubt
he
might
say
we
can
conduct
our
works
as
well
on
that
as
on
any
other
theory
or
as
we
could
on
no
theory
at
all
but
if
you
offer
it
as
proof
we
can
only
say
that
we
have
not
yet
reduced
all
motion
to
one
source
or
all
energies
to
one
law
much
less
to
one
act
of
creation
although
we
have
tried
our
best
the
result
of
some
centuries
of
experiment
tended
to
raise
rather
than
silence
doubt
although
even
in
his
own
day
thomas
would
have
been
scandalized
beyond
the
resources
of
his
latin
had
saint
bonaventure
met
him
at
saint
louis
and
complimented
him
in
the
king
hearing
on
having
proved
beyond
all
franciscan
cavils
that
the
church
intellectual
had
necessarily
but
one
first
cause
and
creator
himself
the
church
intellectual
like
the
church
architectural
implied
not
one
architect
but
myriads
and
not
one
fixed
intelligent
architect
at
the
end
of
the
series
but
a
vanishing
vista
without
a
beginning
at
any
definite
moment
and
if
thomas
pressed
his
argument
the
mechanic
who
should
attend
his
conferences
at
the
sorbonne
would
be
apt
to
say
so
what
is
the
use
of
trying
to
argue
me
into
it
your
inference
may
be
sound
logic
but
is
not
proof
actually
we
know
less
about
it
than
you
did
all
we
know
is
the
thing
we
handle
and
we
can
not
handle
your
fixed
intelligent
prime
motor
to
your
old
ideas
of
form
we
have
added
what
we
call
force
and
we
are
rather
further
than
ever
from
reducing
the
complex
to
unity
in
fact
if
you
are
aiming
to
convince
me
i
will
tell
you
flatly
that
i
know
only
the
multiple
and
have
no
use
for
unity
at
all
in
the
thirteenth
century
men
did
not
depend
so
much
as
now
on
actual
experiment
but
the
nominalist
said
in
effect
the
same
thing
unity
to
him
was
a
pure
concept
and
any
one
who
thought
it
real
would
believe
that
a
triangle
was
alive
and
could
walk
on
its
legs
without
proving
unity
philosophers
saw
no
way
to
prove
god
they
could
only
fall
back
on
an
attempt
to
prove
that
the
concept
of
unity
proved
itself
and
this
phantasm
drove
the
cartesians
to
drop
thomas
argument
and
assert
that
the
mere
fact
of
having
within
us
the
idea
of
a
thing
more
perfect
than
ourselves
proves
the
real
existence
of
that
thing
four
hundred
years
earlier
saint
thomas
had
replied
in
advance
that
descartes
wanted
to
prove
altogether
too
much
and
spinoza
showed
mathematically
that
saint
thomas
had
been
in
the
right
the
finest
religious
mind
of
the
time
pascal
admitted
it
and
gave
up
the
struggle
like
the
mystics
of
victor
thus
some
of
the
greatest
priests
and
professors
of
the
church
including
duns
scotus
himself
seemed
not
wholly
satisfied
that
thomas
proof
was
complete
but
most
of
them
admitted
that
it
was
the
safest
among
possible
foundations
and
that
it
showed
as
architecture
the
norman
temper
of
courage
and
caution
the
norman
was
ready
to
run
great
risks
but
he
would
rather
grasp
too
little
than
too
much
he
narrowed
the
spacing
of
his
piers
rather
than
spread
them
too
wide
for
safe
vaulting
between
norman
blood
and
breton
blood
was
a
singular
gap
as
renan
and
every
other
breton
has
delighted
to
point
out
both
abelard
and
descartes
were
breton
the
breton
seized
more
than
he
could
hold
the
norman
took
less
than
he
would
have
liked
god
then
is
proved
what
the
schools
called
form
what
science
calls
energy
and
what
the
intermediate
period
called
the
evidence
of
design
made
the
foundation
of
saint
thomas
cathedral
god
is
an
intelligent
fixed
prime
motor
not
a
concept
or
proved
by
concepts
a
concrete
fact
proved
by
the
senses
of
sight
and
touch
on
that
foundation
thomas
built
the
walls
and
vaults
of
his
church
were
more
complex
than
the
foundation
especially
the
towers
were
troublesome
dogma
the
vital
purpose
of
the
church
required
support
the
most
weighty
dogma
the
central
tower
of
the
norman
cathedral
was
the
trinity
and
between
the
breton
solution
which
was
too
heavy
and
the
french
solution
which
was
too
light
the
norman
thomas
found
a
way
remembering
how
vehemently
the
french
church
under
saint
bernard
had
protected
the
trinity
from
all
interference
whatever
one
turns
anxiously
to
see
what
thomas
said
about
it
and
unless
one
misunderstands
him
as
is
very
likely
indeed
to
be
the
case
since
no
one
may
even
profess
to
understand
the
trinity
thomas
treated
it
as
simply
as
he
could
god
being
conscious
of
himself
thinks
himself
his
thought
is
himself
his
own
reflection
in
the
verb
the
son
est
in
deo
intelligente
seipsum
verbum
dei
quasi
deus
intellectus
the
idea
was
not
new
and
as
ideas
went
it
was
hardly
a
mystery
but
the
next
step
was
naif
god
as
a
double
consciousness
loves
himself
and
realizes
himself
in
the
holy
ghost
the
third
side
of
the
triangle
is
love
or
grace
many
theologians
have
found
fault
with
this
treatment
of
the
subject
which
seemed
open
to
every
objection
that
had
been
made
to
abelard
gilbert
de
la
poree
or
a
thousand
other
logicians
they
commonly
asked
why
thomas
stopped
the
deity
at
love
or
inside
the
triangle
since
these
realizations
were
real
not
symbolic
and
the
square
was
at
least
as
real
as
any
other
combination
of
line
thomas
replied
that
knowledge
and
will
the
verb
and
the
holy
ghost
were
alone
essential
the
reply
did
not
suit
every
one
even
among
doctors
but
since
saint
thomas
rested
on
this
simple
assertion
it
is
no
concern
of
ours
to
argue
the
theology
only
as
art
one
can
afford
to
say
that
the
form
is
more
architectural
than
religious
it
would
surely
have
been
suspicious
to
saint
bernard
mystery
there
was
none
and
logic
little
the
concept
of
the
holy
ghost
was
childlike
for
a
pupil
of
aristotle
it
was
inadmissible
since
it
led
to
nothing
and
helped
no
step
toward
the
universe
admitting
if
necessary
the
criticism
thomas
need
not
admit
the
blame
if
blame
there
were
every
theologian
was
obliged
to
stop
the
pursuit
of
logic
by
force
before
it
dragged
him
into
paganism
and
pantheism
theology
begins
with
the
universal
god
who
must
be
a
reality
not
a
symbol
but
it
is
forced
to
limit
the
process
of
god
realizations
somewhere
or
the
priest
soon
becomes
a
worshipper
of
god
in
sticks
and
stones
theologists
had
commonly
chosen
from
time
immemorial
to
stop
at
the
trinity
within
the
triangle
they
were
wholly
realist
but
they
could
not
admit
that
god
went
on
to
realize
himself
in
the
square
and
circle
or
that
the
third
member
of
the
trinity
contained
multiplicity
because
the
trinity
was
a
restless
weight
on
the
church
piers
which
like
the
central
tower
constantly
tended
to
fall
and
needed
to
be
lightened
thomas
gave
it
the
lightest
form
possible
and
there
fixed
it
then
came
his
great
the
vaulting
of
his
broad
nave
and
if
ignorance
is
allowed
an
opinion
even
a
lost
soul
may
admire
the
grand
simplicity
of
thomas
scheme
he
swept
away
the
horizontal
lines
altogether
leaving
them
barely
as
a
part
of
decoration
the
whole
weight
of
his
arches
fell
as
in
the
latest
gothic
where
the
eye
sees
nothing
to
break
the
sheer
spring
of
the
nervures
from
the
rosette
on
the
keystone
a
hundred
feet
above
down
to
the
church
floor
in
thomas
creation
nothing
intervened
between
god
and
his
world
secondary
causes
become
ornaments
only
two
forces
god
and
man
stood
in
the
church
the
chapter
of
creation
is
so
serious
and
thomas
creation
like
every
other
is
open
to
so
much
debate
that
no
student
can
allow
another
to
explain
it
and
certainly
no
man
whatever
either
saint
or
sceptic
can
ever
yet
have
understood
creation
aright
unless
divinely
inspired
but
whatever
thomas
theory
was
as
he
meant
it
he
seems
to
be
understood
as
holding
that
every
created
individual
animal
vegetable
or
mineral
was
a
special
divine
act
whatever
has
form
is
created
and
whatever
is
created
takes
form
directly
from
the
will
of
god
which
is
also
his
act
the
intermediate
universals
the
secondary
causes
vanish
as
causes
they
are
at
most
sequences
or
relations
all
merge
in
one
universal
act
of
will
instantaneous
infinite
eternal
saint
thomas
saw
god
much
as
milton
saw
him
resplendent
in
that
glorious
form
that
light
unsufferable
and
that
blaze
of
majesty
wherewith
he
wont
at
heaven
high
to
sit
the
midst
of
trinal
unity
except
that
in
thomas
thought
the
was
a
table
because
god
did
not
take
counsel
he
was
an
act
the
trinity
was
an
infinite
possibility
of
will
nothing
within
but
the
baby
image
of
the
giant
mass
of
things
to
come
at
large
neither
time
nor
space
neither
matter
nor
mind
not
even
force
existed
nor
could
any
intelligence
conceive
how
even
though
they
should
exist
they
could
be
united
in
the
lowest
association
a
crystal
was
as
miraculous
as
socrates
only
abstract
force
or
what
the
schoolmen
called
form
existed
undeveloped
from
eternity
like
the
abstract
line
in
mathematics
fifty
or
a
hundred
years
before
saint
thomas
settled
the
church
dogma
a
monk
of
citeaux
or
some
other
abbey
a
certain
alain
of
lille
had
written
a
latin
poem
as
abstruse
an
allegory
as
the
best
which
had
the
merit
of
painting
the
scene
of
man
creation
as
far
as
concerned
the
mechanical
process
much
as
thomas
seems
to
have
seen
it
haureau
has
printed
an
extract
vol
i
alain
conceded
to
the
weakness
of
human
thought
that
god
was
working
in
time
and
space
or
rather
on
his
throne
in
heaven
when
nature
proposing
to
create
a
new
and
improved
man
sent
reason
and
prudence
up
to
ask
him
for
a
soul
to
fit
the
new
body
having
passed
through
various
adventures
and
much
scholastic
instruction
the
messenger
prudence
arrived
after
having
dropped
her
dangerous
friend
reason
by
the
way
the
request
was
respectfully
presented
to
god
and
favourably
received
god
promised
the
soul
and
at
once
sent
his
servant
noys
thought
to
the
storehouse
of
ideas
to
choose
it

of
the

to

the

should

shaped
rich
in

of

then

at

turning

by

each

she
hardly
finds

at

the
sought

appears
this
form
noys
herself
brings
to
god
for
him
to
form
a
soul
to
its
pattern
he
takes
the
seal
and
gives
form
to
the
soul
after
the
model
of
the
form
itself
stamping
on
the
sample
the
figure
such
as
the
idea
requires
the
seal
covers
the
whole
field
and
the
impression
expresses
the
stamp
the
translation
is
probably
full
of
mistakes
indeed
one
is
permitted
to
doubt
whether
alain
himself
accurately
understood
the
process
but
in
substance
he
meant
that
god
contained
a
storehouse
of
ideas
and
stamped
each
creation
with
one
of
these
forms
the
poets
used
a
variety
of
figures
to
help
out
their
logic
but
that
of
the
potter
and
his
pot
was
one
of
the
most
common
omar
khayyam
was
using
it
at
the
same
time
with
alain
of
lille
but
with
a
difference
for
his
pot
seems
to
have
been
matter
alone
and
his
soul
was
the
wine
it
received
from
god
while
alain
soul
seems
to
have
been
the
form
and
not
the
contents
of
the
pot
the
figure
matters
little
in
any
case
god
act
was
the
union
of
mind
with
matter
by
the
same
act
or
will
which
created
both
no
intermediate
cause
or
condition
intervened
no
secondary
influence
had
anything
whatever
to
do
with
the
result
time
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
every
individual
that
has
existed
or
shall
exist
was
created
by
the
same
instantaneous
act
for
all
time
when
the
question
regards
the
universal
agent
who
produces
beings
and
time
we
can
not
consider
him
as
acting
now
and
before
according
to
the
succession
of
time
god
emanated
time
force
matter
mind
as
he
might
emanate
gravitation
not
as
a
part
of
his
substance
but
as
an
energy
of
his
will
and
maintains
them
in
their
activity
by
the
same
act
not
by
a
new
one
every
individual
is
a
part
of
the
direct
act
not
a
secondary
outcome
the
soul
has
no
father
or
mother
of
all
errors
one
of
the
most
serious
is
to
suppose
that
the
soul
descends
by
generation
having
life
and
action
of
its
own
it
subsists
without
the
body
it
must
therefore
be
produced
directly
and
since
it
is
not
a
material
substance
it
can
not
be
produced
by
way
of
generation
it
must
necessarily
be
created
by
god
consequently
to
suppose
that
the
intelligence
or
intelligent
soul
is
the
effect
of
generation
is
to
suppose
that
it
is
not
a
pure
and
simple
substance
but
corruptible
like
the
body
it
is
therefore
heresy
to
say
that
this
soul
is
transmitted
by
generation
what
is
true
of
the
soul
should
be
true
of
all
other
form
since
no
form
is
a
material
substance
the
utmost
possible
relation
between
any
two
individuals
is
that
god
may
have
used
the
same
stamp
or
mould
for
a
series
of
creations
and
especially
for
the
less
spiritual
god
is
the
first
model
for
all
things
one
may
also
say
that
among
his
creatures
some
serve
as
types
or
models
for
others
because
there
are
some
which
are
made
in
the
image
of
others
but
generation
means
sequence
not
cause
the
only
true
cause
is
god
creation
is
his
sole
act
in
which
no
second
cause
can
share
creation
is
more
perfect
and
loftier
than
generation
because
it
aims
at
producing
the
whole
substance
of
the
being
though
it
starts
from
absolute
nothing
thomas
aquinas
when
he
pleased
was
singularly
lucid
and
on
this
point
he
was
particularly
positive
the
architect
insisted
on
the
controlling
idea
of
his
structure
the
church
was
god
and
its
lines
excluded
interference
god
and
the
church
embraced
all
the
converging
lines
of
the
universe
and
the
universe
showed
none
but
lines
that
converged
between
god
and
man
nothing
whatever
intervened
the
individual
was
a
compound
of
form
or
soul
and
matter
but
both
were
always
created
together
by
the
same
act
out
of
nothing
simpliciter
fatendum
est
animas
simul
cum
corporibus
creari
et
infundi
it
must
be
distinctly
understood
that
souls
were
not
created
before
bodies
but
that
they
were
created
at
the
same
time
as
the
bodies
they
animate
nothing
whatever
preceded
this
union
of
two
substances
which
did
not
exist
creatio
est
productio
alicujus
rei
secundum
suam
totam
substantiam
nullo
praesupposito
quod
sit
vel
increatum
vel

aliquo

language
can
go
no
further
in
exclusion
of
every
possible
preceding
secondary
or
subsequent
cause
productio
universalis
entis
a
deo
non
est
motus
nec
mutatio
sed

quaedam
simplex
emanatio
the
whole
universe
is
so
to
speak
a
simple
emanation
from
god
the
famous
junction
then
is
made
that
celebrated
fusion
of
the
universal
with
the
individual
of
unity
with
multiplicity
of
god
and
nature
which
had
broken
the
neck
of
every
philosophy
ever
invented
which
had
ruined
william
of
champeaux
and
was
to
ruin
descartes
this
evolution
of
the
finite
from
the
infinite
was
accomplished
the
supreme
triumph
was
as
easily
effected
by
thomas
aquinas
as
it
was
to
be
again
effected
four
hundred
years
later
by
spinoza
he
had
merely
to
assert
the
fact
it
is
so
it
can
not
be
otherwise
for
the
thousandth
and
time
what
is
the
use
of
discussing
this
prime
motor
this
spinozan
substance
any
longer
we
know
it
is
there
that
as
professor
haeckel
very
justly
repeats
for
the
millionth
time
is
enough
one
point
however
remained
undetermined
the
prime
motor
and
his
action
stood
fixed
and
no
one
wished
to
disturb
him
but
this
was
not
the
point
that
had
disturbed
william
of
champeaux
question
still
remained
to
be
answered
how
did
socrates
differ
from
plato
judas
from
john
thomas
aquinas
from
professor
haeckel
were
they
in
fact
two
or
one
what
made
an
individual
what
was
centimetre
measure
the
abstract
form
or
soul
which
existed
as
a
possibility
in
god
from
all
time
was
it
one
or
many
to
the
church
this
issue
overshadowed
all
else
for
if
humanity
was
one
and
not
multiple
the
church
which
dealt
only
with
individuals
was
lost
to
the
schools
also
the
issue
was
vital
for
if
the
soul
or
form
was
already
multiple
from
the
first
unity
was
lost
the
ultimate
substance
and
prime
motor
itself
became
multiple
the
whole
issue
was
reopened
to
the
consternation
of
the
church
and
even
of
his
own
order
thomas
following
closely
his
masters
albert
and
aristotle
asserted
that
the
soul
was
measured
by
matter
division
occurs
in
substances
in
ratio
of
quantity
as
aristotle
says
in
his
and
so
dimensional
quantity
is
a
principle
of
individuation
the
soul
is
a
fluid
absorbed
by
matter
in
proportion
to
the
absorptive
power
of
the
matter
the
soul
is
an
energy
existing
in
matter
proportionately
to
the
dimensional
quantity
of
the
matter
the
soul
is
a
wine
greater
or
less
in
quantity
according
to
the
size
of
the
cup
in
our
report
of
the
great
debate
of
between
champeaux
and
abelard
we
have
seen
william
persistently
tempting
abelard
to
fall
into
this
admission
that
matter
made
the
man
that
the
universal
equilateral
triangle
became
an
individual
if
it
were
shaped
in
metal
the
matter
giving
it
reality
which
mere
form
could
not
give
and
abelard
evading
the
issue
as
though
his
life
depended
on
it
in
fact
had
abelard
dared
to
follow
aristotle
into
what
looked
like
an
admission
that
socrates
and
plato
were
identical
as
form
and
differed
only
in
weight
his
life
might
have
been
the
forfeit
how
saint
thomas
escaped
is
a
question
closely
connected
with
the
same
inquiry
about
saint
francis
of
assisi
a
church
which
embraced
with
equal
sympathy
and
within
a
hundred
years
the
virgin
saint
bernard
william
of
champeaux
and
the
school
of
victor
peter
the
venerable
saint
francis
of
assisi
saint
dominic
saint
thomas
aquinas
and
saint
bonaventure
was
more
liberal
than
any
modern
state
can
afford
to
be
radical
contradictions
the
state
may
perhaps
tolerate
though
hardly
but
never
embrace
or
profess
such
elasticity
long
ago
vanished
from
human
thought
yet
only
dominicans
believe
that
the
church
adopted
this
law
of
individualization
or
even
assented
to
it
if
jourdain
is
right
thomas
was
quickly
obliged
to
give
it
another
form
that
though
all
souls
belonged
to
the
same
species
they
differed
in
their
aptitudes
for
uniting
with
particular
bodies
this
soul
is
commensurate
with
this
body
and
not
with
that
other
one
the
idea
is
double
for
either
the
souls
individualized
themselves
and
thomas
abandoned
his
doctrine
of
their
instantaneous
creation
with
the
bodies
out
of
nothing
or
god
individualized
them
in
the
act
of
creation
and
matter
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
the
difficulty
is
no
concern
of
ours
but
the
great
scholars
who
took
upon
themselves
to
explain
it
made
it
worse
until
at
last
one
gathers
only
that
saint
thomas
held
one
of
three
views
either
the
soul
of
humanity
was
individualized
by
god
or
it
individualized
itself
or
it
was
divided
by
ratio
of
quantity
that
is
by
matter
this
amounts
to
saying
that
one
knows
nothing
about
it
which
we
knew
before
and
may
admit
with
calmness
but
thomas
aquinas
was
not
so
happily
placed
between
the
church
and
the
schools
humanity
had
a
form
common
to
itself
which
made
it
what
it
was
by
some
means
this
form
was
associated
with
matter
in
fact
matter
was
only
known
as
associated
with
form
if
then
god
by
an
instantaneous
act
created
matter
and
gave
it
form
according
to
the
dimensions
of
the
matter
innocent
ignorance
might
infer
that
there
was
in
the
act
of
god
one
soul
and
one
which
he
united
in
different
proportions
to
make
men
and
things
such
a
doctrine
was
fatal
to
the
church
no
greater
heresy
could
be
charged
against
the
worst
arab
or
jew
and
thomas
was
so
well
aware
of
his
danger
that
he
recoiled
from
it
with
a
vehemence
not
at
all
in
keeping
with
his
supposed
phlegm
with
feverish
eagerness
to
get
clear
of
such
companions
he
denied
and
denounced
in
all
companies
in
season
and
out
of
season
the
idea
that
intellect
was
one
and
the
same
for
all
men
differing
only
with
the
quantity
of
matter
it
accompanied
he
challenged
the
adherent
of
such
a
doctrine
to
battle
let
him
take
the
pen
if
he
dares
no
one
dared
seeing
that
even
jews
enjoyed
a
share
of
common
sense
and
had
seen
some
of
their
friends
burn
at
the
stake
not
very
long
before
for
such
opinions
not
even
openly
maintained
while
uneducated
people
who
are
perhaps
incapable
of
receiving
intellect
at
all
but
for
whose
instruction
and
salvation
the
great
work
of
saint
thomas
and
his
scholars
must
chiefly
exist
can
not
do
battle
because
they
can
not
understand
thomas
doctrine
of
matter
and
form
which
to
them
seems
frank
pantheism
so
it
appeared
to
duns
scotus
also
if
one
may
assert
in
the
doctor
subtilis
any
opinion
without
qualification
duns
began
his
career
only
about
after
thomas
death
and
stands
therefore
beyond
our
horizon
but
he
is
still
the
pride
of
the
franciscan
order
and
stands
second
in
authority
to
the
great
dominican
alone
in
denying
thomas
doctrine
that
matter
individualizes
mind
duns
laid
himself
open
to
the
worse
charge
of
investing
matter
with
a
certain
embryonic
independent
shadowy
soul
of
its
own
scot
system
compared
with
that
of
thomas
tended
toward
liberty
scot
held
that
the
excess
of
power
in
thomas
prime
motor
neutralized
the
power
of
his
secondary
causes
so
that
these
appeared
altogether
superfluous
this
is
a
point
that
ought
to
be
left
to
the
church
to
decide
but
there
can
be
no
harm
in
quoting
on
the
other
hand
the
authority
of
some
of
scot
critics
within
the
church
who
have
thought
that
his
doctrine
tended
to
deify
matter
and
to
keep
open
the
road
to
spinoza
narrow
and
dangerous
was
the
always
between
pantheism
and
materialism
and
the
chief
interest
of
the
schools
was
in
finding
fault
with
each
other
paths
the
opinions
in
themselves
need
not
disturb
us
although
the
question
is
as
open
to
dispute
as
ever
it
was
and
perhaps
as
much
disputed
but
the
turn
of
thomas
mind
is
worth
study
a
century
or
two
later
his
passion
to
be
reasonable
scientific
architectural
would
have
brought
him
within
range
of
the
inquisition
francis
of
assisi
was
not
more
archaic
and
than
thomas
of
aquino
was
modern
and
scientific
in
his
effort
to
be
logical
he
forced
his
deity
to
be
as
logical
as
himself
which
hardly
suited
omnipotence
he
hewed
the
church
dogmas
into
shape
as
though
they
were
rough
stones
about
no
dogma
could
mankind
feel
interest
more
acute
than
about
that
of
immortality
which
seemed
to
be
the
single
point
vitally
necessary
for
any
church
to
prove
and
define
as
clearly
as
light
itself
thomas
trimmed
down
the
soul
to
half
its
legitimate
claims
as
an
immortal
being
by
insisting
that
god
created
it
from
nothing
in
the
same
act
or
will
by
which
he
created
the
body
and
united
the
two
in
time
and
space
the
soul
existed
as
form
for
the
body
and
had
no
previous
existence
logic
seemed
to
require
that
when
the
body
died
and
dissolved
after
the
union
which
had
lasted
at
most
only
an
instant
or
two
of
eternity
the
soul
which
fitted
that
body
and
no
other
should
dissolve
with
it
in
that
case
the
church
dissolved
too
since
it
had
no
reason
for
existence
except
the
soul
thomas
met
the
difficulty
by
suggesting
that
the
form
might
take
permanence
from
the
matter
to
which
it
gave
form
that
matter
should
individualize
mind
was
itself
a
violent
wrench
of
logic
but
that
it
should
also
give
permanence
the
one
quality
it
did
not
possess
to
this
individual
mind
seemed
to
many
learned
doctors
a
scandal
perhaps
thomas
meant
to
leave
the
responsibility
on
the
church
where
it
belonged
as
a
matter
not
of
logic
but
of
revealed
truth
at
all
events
this
treatment
of
mind
and
matter
brought
him
into
trouble
which
few
modern
logicians
would
suspect
the
human
soul
having
become
a
person
by
contact
with
matter
and
having
gained
eternal
personality
by
the
momentary
union
was
finished
and
remains
to
this
day
for
practical
purposes
unchanged
but
the
angels
and
devils
a
world
of
realities
then
more
real
than
man
were
never
united
with
matter
and
therefore
could
not
be
persons
thomas
admitted
and
insisted
that
the
angels
being
immaterial
neither
clothed
in
matter
nor
stamped
on
it
nor
mixed
with
it
were
universals
that
is
each
was
a
species
in
himself
a
class
or
perhaps
what
would
be
now
called
an
energy
with
no
other
individuality
than
he
gave
himself
the
idea
seems
to
modern
science
reasonable
enough
science
has
to
deal
for
example
with
scores
of
chemical
energies
which
it
knows
little
about
except
that
they
always
seem
to
be
constant
to
the
same
conditions
but
every
one
knows
that
in
the
particular
relation
of
mind
to
matter
the
battle
is
as
furious
as
ever
the
soul
has
always
refused
to
live
in
peace
with
the
body
the
angels
too
were
always
in
rebellion
they
insisted
on
personality
and
the
devils
even
more
obstinately
than
the
angels
the
dispute
was
and
is
far
from
trifling
mind
would
rather
ignore
matter
altogether
in
the
thirteenth
century
mind
did
indeed
admit
that
matter
was
something
which
it
quite
refuses
to
admit
in
the
twentieth
but
treated
it
as
a
nuisance
to
be
abated
to
the
pure
in
spirit
one
argued
in
vain
that
spirit
must
compromise
that
nature
compromised
that
god
compromised
that
man
himself
was
nothing
but
a
somewhat
clumsy
compromise
no
argument
served
mind
insisted
on
absolute
despotism
schoolmen
as
well
as
mystics
would
not
believe
that
matter
was
what
it
seemed
if
indeed
it
existed
unsubstantial
shifty
shadowy
changing
with
incredible
swiftness
into
dust
gas
flame
vanishing
in
mysterious
lines
of
force
into
space
beyond
hope
of
recovery
whirled
about
in
eternity
and
infinity
by
that
mind
form
energy
or
thought
which
guides
and
rules
and
tyrannizes
and
is
the
universe
the
church
wanted
to
be
pure
spirit
she
regarded
matter
with
antipathy
as
something
foul
to
be
held
at
arms
length
lest
it
should
stain
and
corrupt
the
soul
the
most
she
would
willingly
admit
was
that
mind
and
matter
might
travel
side
by
side
like
a
doubleheaded
comet
on
parallel
lines
that
never
met
with
a
preestablished
harmony
that
existed
only
in
the
prime
motor
thomas
and
his
master
albert
were
almost
alone
in
imposing
on
the
church
the
compromise
so
necessary
for
its
equilibrium
the
balance
of
matter
against
mind
was
the
same
necessity
in
the
church
intellectual
as
the
balance
of
thrusts
in
the
arch
of
the
gothic
cathedral
nowhere
did
thomas
show
his
architectural
obstinacy
quite
so
plainly
as
in
thus
taking
matter
under
his
protection
nothing
would
induce
him
to
compromise
with
the
angels
he
insisted
on
keeping
man
wholly
apart
as
a
complex
of
energies
in
which
matter
shared
equally
with
mind
the
church
must
rest
firmly
on
both
the
angels
differed
from
other
beings
below
them
precisely
because
they
were
immaterial
and
impersonal
such
rigid
logic
outraged
the
spiritual
church
perhaps
thomas
sudden
death
in
alone
saved
him
from
the
fate
of
abelard
but
it
did
not
save
his
doctrine
two
years
afterwards
in
the
french
and
english
churches
combined
to
condemn
it
etienne
tempier
bishop
of
paris
presided
over
the
french
synod
robert
kilwardeby
of
the
dominican
order
archbishop
of
canterbury
presided
over
the
council
at
oxford
the
synods
were
composed
of
schoolmen
as
well
as
churchmen
and
seem
to
have
been
the
result
of
a
serious
struggle
for
power
between
the
dominican
and
franciscan
orders
apparently
the
church
compromised
between
them
by
condemning
the
errors
of
both
some
of
these
errors
springing
from
alexander
hales
and
his
franciscan
schools
were
in
effect
the
foundation
of
another
church
some
were
expressly
charged
against
brother
thomas
contra
fratrem
thomam
the
councils
forbade
teaching
that

these

made

old
albertus
magnus
who
was
the
real
victim
of
attack
fought
for
himself
and
for
thomas
after
a
long
and
earnest
effort
the
thomists
rooted
out
opposition
in
the
order
and
carried
their
campaign
to
rome
after
fifty
years
of
struggle
by
use
of
every
method
known
in
church
politics
the
dominican
order
in
caused
john
xxii
to
canonize
thomas
and
in
effect
affirm
his
doctrine
the
story
shows
how
modern
how
heterodox
how
material
how
altogether
new
and
revolutionary
the
system
of
saint
thomas
seemed
at
first
even
in
the
schools
but
that
was
the
affair
of
the
church
and
a
matter
of
pure
theology
we
study
only
his
art
step
by
step
stone
by
stone
we
see
him
build
his
like
a
stonemason
with
the
care
that
the
architects
put
into
their
work
as
saw
some
similar
architect
at
rouen
building
the
tower
of
he
has
thrown
over
his
work
the
grace
and
finesse
the
study
of
detail
the
sobriety
in
projections
the
perfect
harmony
which
belongs
to
his
school
and
yet
he
was
rigidly
structural
and
norman
the
foundation
showed
it
the
elevation
which
is
god
developed
it
the
vaulting
with
its
balance
of
thrusts
in
mind
and
matter
proved
it
but
he
had
still
the
hardest
task
in
art
to
model
man
the
cathedral
then
is
built
and
god
is
built
into
it
but
thus
far
god
is
there
alone
filling
it
all
and
maintains
the
equilibrium
by
balancing
created
matter
separately
against
created
mind
the
proportions
of
the
building
are
superb
nothing
so
lofty
so
large
in
treatment
so
true
in
scale
so
eloquent
of
multiplicity
in
unity
has
ever
been
conceived
elsewhere
but
it
was
the
virtue
or
the
fault
of
superb
structures
like
bourges
and
amiens
and
the
church
universal
that
they
seemed
to
need
man
more
than
man
needed
them
they
were
made
for
crowds
for
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
of
human
beings
for
the
whole
human
race
on
its
knees
hungry
for
pardon
and
love
chartres
needed
no
crowd
for
it
was
meant
as
a
palace
of
the
virgin
and
the
virgin
filled
it
wholly
but
the
trinity
made
their
church
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
accommodate
man
and
made
man
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
fill
their
church
if
man
failed
to
fill
it
the
church
and
the
trinity
seemed
equally
failures
empty
bourges
and
beauvais
are
cold
hardly
as
religious
as
a
wayside
cross
and
yet
even
empty
they
are
perhaps
more
religious
than
when
filled
with
cattle
and
machines
saint
thomas
needed
to
fill
his
church
with
real
men
and
although
he
had
created
his
own
god
for
that
special
purpose
the
task
was
as
every
boy
knew
by
heart
the
most
difficult
that
omnipotence
had
dealt
with
god
as
descartes
justly
said
we
know
but
what
is
man
the
schools
answered
man
is
a
rational
animal
so
was
apparently
a
dog
or
a
bee
or
a
beaver
none
of
which
seemed
to
need
churches
modern
science
with
infinite
effort
has
discovered
and
announced
that
man
is
a
bewildering
complex
of
energies
which
helps
little
to
explain
his
relations
with
the
ultimate
substance
or
energy
or
prime
motor
whose
existence
both
science
and
schoolmen
admit
which
science
studies
in
laboratories
and
religion
worships
in
churches
the
man
whom
god
created
to
fill
his
church
must
be
an
energy
independent
of
god
otherwise
god
filled
his
own
church
with
his
own
energy
thus
far
the
god
of
saint
thomas
was
alone
in
his
church
the
beings
he
had
created
out
of
nothing
omar
pipkins
of
clay
and
shape
stood
against
the
walls
waiting
to
receive
the
wine
of
life
a
life
of
their
own
of
that
life
energy
will
or
wine
whatever
the
poets
or
professors
called
it
god
was
the
only
cause
as
he
was
also
the
immediate
cause
and
support
thomas
was
emphatic
on
that
point
god
is
the
cause
of
energy
as
the
sun
is
the
cause
of
colour
prout
sol
dicitur
causa
manifestationis
coloris
he
not
only
gives
forms
to
his
pipkins
or
energies
to
his
agents
but
he
also
maintains
those
forms
in
being
dat
formas
creaturis
agentibus
et
eas
tenet
in
esse
he
acts
directly
not
through
secondary
causes
on
everything
and
every
one
deus

if
for
an
instant
god
action
which
is
also
his
will
were
to
stop
the
universe
would
not
merely
fall
to
pieces
but
would
vanish
and
must
then
be
created
anew
from
nothing

and
the
whole

return
to

if
that
radiation
ceased
even
for
an
instant
everything
is
created
by
one
instantaneous
eternal
universal
act
of
will
and
by
the
same
act
is
maintained
in
being
where
then
in
what
mysterious
cave
outside
of
creation
could
man
and
his
free
will
and
his
private
world
of
responsibilities
and
duties
lie
hidden
unless
man
was
a
free
agent
in
a
world
of
his
own
beyond
constraint
the
church
was
a
fraud
and
it
helped
little
to
add
that
the
state
was
another
if
god
was
the
sole
and
immediate
cause
and
support
of
everything
in
his
creation
god
was
also
the
cause
of
its
defects
and
could
not
being
justice
and
goodness
in
essence
hold
man
responsible
for
his
own
omissions
still
less
could
the
state
or
church
do
it
in
his
name
whatever
truth
lies
in
the
charge
that
the
schools
discussed
futile
questions
by
faulty
methods
one
can
not
decently
deny
that
in
this
case
the
question
was
practical
and
the
method
vital
theist
or
atheist
monist
or
anarchist
must
all
admit
that
society
and
science
are
equally
interested
with
theology
in
deciding
whether
the
universe
is
one
or
many
a
harmony
or
a
discord
the
church
and
state
asserted
that
it
was
a
harmony
and
that
they
were
its
representatives
they
say
so
still
their
claim
led
to
singular
but
unavoidable
conclusions
with
which
society
has
struggled
for
seven
hundred
years
and
is
still
struggling
freedom
could
not
exist
in
nature
or
even
in
god
after
the
single
unalterable
act
or
will
which
created
the
only
possible
free
will
was
that
of
god
before
the
act
abelard
with
his
rigid
logic
averred
that
god
had
no
freedom
being
himself
whatever
is
most
perfect
he
produced
necessarily
the
most
perfect
possible
world
nothing
seemed
more
logical
but
if
god
acted
necessarily
his
world
must
also
be
of
necessity
the
only
possible
product
of
his
act
and
the
church
became
an
impertinence
since
man
proved
only
fatuity
by
attempting
to
interfere
thomas
dared
not
disturb
the
foundations
of
the
church
and
therefore
began
by
laying
down
the
law
that
god
previous
to
his
act
could
choose
and
had
chosen
whatever
scheme
of
creation
he
pleased
and
that
the
harmony
of
the
actual
scheme
proved
his
perfections
thus
he
saved
god
free
will
this
philosophical
apse
would
have
closed
the
lines
and
finished
the
plan
of
his
had
the
universe
not
shown
some
divergencies
or
discords
needing
to
be
explained
the
student
of
the
latin
quarter
was
then
harder
to
convince
than
now
that
god
was
infinite
love
and
his
world
a
perfect
harmony
when
perfect
love
and
harmony
showed
them
even
in
the
latin
quarter
and
still
more
in
revealed
truth
a
picture
of
suffering
sorrow
and
death
plague
pestilence
and
famine
inundations
droughts
and
frosts
catastrophes
and
accidents
in
corners
cruelty
perversity
stupidity
uncertainty
insanity
virtue
begetting
vice
vice
working
for
good
happiness
without
sense
selfishness
without
gain
misery
without
cause
and
horrors
undefined
the
students
in
public
dared
not
ask
as
voltaire
did
avec
son
hideux
sourire
whether
the
lisbon
earthquake
was
the
final
proof
of
god
infinite
goodness
but
in
private
they
used
the
argumentum
ad
personam
divinam
freely
enough
and
when
the
church
told
them
that
evil
did
not
exist
the
ribalds
laughed
saint
augustine
certainly
tempted
satan
when
he
fastened
the
church
to
this
doctrine
that
evil
is
only
the
privation
of
good
an
amissio
boni
and
that
good
alone
exists
the
point
was
infinitely
troublesome
good
was
order
law
unity
evil
was
disorder
anarchy
multiplicity
which
was
truth
the
church
had
committed
itself
to
the
dogma
that
order
and
unity
were
the
ultimate
truth
and
that
the
anarchist
should
be
burned
she
could
do
nothing
else
and
society
supported
her
still
supports
her
yet
the
church
who
was
wiser
than
the
state
had
always
seen
that
saint
augustine
dealt
with
only
half
the
question
she
knew
that
evil
might
be
an
excess
of
good
as
well
as
absence
of
it
that
good
leads
to
evil
evil
to
good
and
that
as
pascal
says
three
degrees
of
polar
elevation
upset
all
jurisprudence
a
meridian
decides
truth
fundamental
laws
change
rights
have
epochs
pleasing
justice
bounded
by
a
river
or
a
mountain
truths
on
this
side
the
pyrenees
errors
beyond
thomas
conceded
that
god
himself
with
the
best
intentions
might
be
the
source
of
evil
and
pleaded
only
that
his
action
might
in
the
end
work
benefits
he
could
offer
no
proof
of
it
but
he
could
assume
as
probable
a
plan
of
good
which
became
the
more
perfect
for
the
very
reason
that
it
allowed
great
liberty
in
detail
one
hardly
feels
saint
thomas
here
in
all
his
force
he
offers
suggestion
rather
than
proof
apology
the
weaker
because
of
obvious
effort
to
apologize
rather
than
defence
for
infinite
goodness
justice
and
power
scoffers
might
add
that
he
invented
a
new
proof
ab
defectu
or
argument
for
proving
the
perfection
of
a
machine
by
the
number
of
its
imperfections
but
at
all
events
society
has
never
done
better
by
way
of
proving
its
right
to
enforce
morals
or
unity
of
opinion
unless
it
asserts
law
it
can
only
assert
force
rigid
theology
went
much
further
in
god
providence
man
was
as
nothing
with
a
proper
sense
of
duty
every
solar
system
should
be
content
to
suffer
if
thereby
the
efficiency
of
the
milky
way
were
improved
such
theology
shocked
saint
thomas
who
never
wholly
abandoned
man
in
order
to
exalt
god
he
persistently
brought
god
and
man
together
and
if
he
erred
the
church
rightly
pardons
him
because
he
erred
on
the
human
side
whenever
the
path
lay
through
the
valley
of
despair
he
called
god
to
his
aid
as
though
he
felt
the
moral
obligation
of
the
creator
to
help
his
creation
at
best
the
vision
of
god
sitting
forever
at
his
willing
the
existence
of
mankind
exactly
as
it
is
while
conscious
that
among
these
myriad
arbitrary
creations
of
his
will
hardly
one
in
a
million
could
escape
temporary
misery
or
eternal
damnation
was
not
the
best
possible
background
for
a
church
as
the
virgin
and
the
saviour
frankly
admitted
by
taking
the
foreground
but
the
church
was
not
responsible
for
it
mankind
could
not
admit
an
anarchical
a
dual
or
a
multiple
universe
the
world
was
there
staring
them
in
the
face
with
all
its
chaotic
conditions
and
society
insisted
on
its
unity
in
society
still
insists
on
treating
it
as
unity
though
no
longer
affecting
logic
society
insists
on
its
free
will
although
free
will
has
never
been
explained
to
the
satisfaction
of
any
but
those
who
much
wish
to
be
satisfied
and
although
the
words
in
any
common
sense
implied
not
unity
but
duality
in
creation
the
church
had
nothing
to
do
with
inventing
this
riddle
the
oldest
that
fretted
mankind
apart
from
all
theological
interferences
fall
of
adam
or
fault
of
eve
atonement
justification
or
redemption
either
the
universe
was
one
or
it
was
two
or
it
was
many
either
energy
was
one
seen
only
in
powers
of
itself
or
it
was
several
either
god
was
harmony
or
he
was
discord
with
practical
unanimity
mankind
rejected
the
dual
or
multiple
scheme
it
insisted
on
unity
thomas
took
the
question
as
it
was
given
him
the
unity
was
full
of
defects
he
did
not
deny
them
but
he
claimed
that
they
might
be
incidents
and
that
the
admitted
unity
might
even
prove
their
beneficence
granting
this
enormous
concession
he
still
needed
a
means
of
bringing
into
the
system
one
element
which
vehemently
refused
to
be
brought
that
is
man
himself
who
insisted
that
the
universe
was
a
unit
but
that
he
was
a
universe
that
energy
was
one
but
that
he
was
another
energy
that
god
was
omnipotent
but
that
man
was
free
the
contradiction
had
always
existed
exists
still
and
always
must
exist
unless
man
either
admits
that
he
is
a
machine
or
agrees
that
anarchy
and
chaos
are
the
habit
of
nature
and
law
and
order
its
accident
the
agreement
may
become
possible
but
it
was
not
possible
in
the
thirteenth
century
nor
is
it
now
saint
thomas
settlement
could
not
be
a
simple
one
or
final
except
for
practical
use
but
it
served
and
it
holds
good
still
no
one
ever
seriously
affirmed
the
literal
freedom
of
will
absolute
liberty
is
absence
of
restraint
responsibility
is
restraint
therefore
the
ideally
free
individual
is
responsible
only
to
himself
this
principle
is
the
philosophical
foundation
of
anarchism
and
for
anything
that
science
has
yet
proved
may
be
the
philosophical
foundation
of
the
universe
but
it
is
fatal
to
all
society
and
is
especially
hostile
to
the
state
perhaps
the
church
of
the
thirteenth
century
might
have
found
a
way
to
use
even
this
principle
for
a
good
purpose
certainly
the
influence
of
saint
bernard
was
sufficiently
unsocial
and
that
of
saint
francis
was
sufficiently
unselfish
to
conciliate
even
anarchists
of
the
militant
class
but
saint
thomas
was
working
for
the
church
and
the
state
not
for
the
salvation
of
souls
and
his
chief
object
was
to
repress
anarchy
the
theory
of
absolute
free
will
never
entered
his
mind
more
than
the
theory
of
material
free
will
would
enter
the
mind
of
an
architect
the
church
gave
him
no
warrant
for
discussing
the
subject
in
such
a
sense
in
fact
the
church
never
admitted
free
will
or
used
the
word
when
it
could
be
avoided
in
latin
the
term
used
was
liberum
arbitrium
free
choice
and
in
french
to
this
day
it
remains
in
strictness
libre
arbitre
still
from
saint
augustine
downwards
the
church
was
never
so
unscientific
as
to
admit
of
liberty
beyond
the
faculty
of
choosing
between
paths
some
leading
through
the
church
and
some
not
but
all
leading
to
the
next
world
as
a
criminal
might
be
allowed
the
liberty
of
choosing
between
the
guillotine
and
the
gallows
without
infringing
on
the
supremacy
of
the
judge
thomas
started
from
that
point
already
far
from
theoretic
freedom
we
are
masters
of
our
acts
he
began
in
the
sense
that
we
can
choose
such
and
such
a
thing
now
we
have
not
to
choose
our
end
but
the
means
that
relate
to
it
as
aristotle
says
unfortunately
even
this
trenchant
amputation
of
man
free
energies
would
not
accord
with
fact
or
with
logic
experience
proved
that
man
power
of
choice
in
action
was
very
far
from
absolute
and
logic
seemed
to
require
that
every
choice
should
have
some
predetermining
cause
which
decided
the
will
to
act
science
affirmed
that
choice
was
not
free
could
not
be
free
without
abandoning
the
unity
of
force
and
the
foundation
of
law
society
insisted
that
its
choice
must
be
left
free
whatever
became
of
science
or
unity
saint
thomas
was
required
to
illustrate
the
theory
of
liberum
arbitrium
by
choosing
a
path
through
these
difficulties
where
path
there
was
obviously
none
thomas
method
of
treating
this
problem
was
sure
to
be
as
scientific
as
the
vaulting
of
a
gothic
arch
indeed
one
follows
it
most
easily
by
translating
his
into
modern
technical
terms
with
very
slight
straining
of
equivalents
thomas
might
now
be
written
thus
by
the
term
god
is
meant
a
prime
motor
which
supplies
all
energy
to
the
universe
and
acts
directly
on
man
as
well
as
on
all
other
creatures
moving
him
as
a
mechanical
motor
might
do
but
man
being
specially
provided
with
an
organism
more
complex
than
the
organisms
of
other
creatures
enjoys
an
exceptional
capacity
for
reflex
action
a
power
of
reflection
which
enables
him
within
certain
limits
to
choose
between
paths
and
this
singular
capacity
is
called
free
choice
or
free
will
of
course
the
reflection
is
not
choice
and
though
a
man
mind
reflected
as
perfectly
as
the
facets
of
a
lighthouse
lantern
it
would
never
reach
a
choice
without
an
energy
which
impels
it
to
act
now
let
us
read
saint
thomas
some
kind
of
an
agent
is
required
to
determine
one
choice
that
agent
is
reflection
man
reflects
then
in
order
to
learn
what
choice
to
make
between
the
two
acts
which
offer
themselves
but
reflection
is
in
its
turn
a
faculty
of
doing
opposite
things
for
we
can
reflect
or
not
reflect
and
we
are
no
further
forward
than
before
one
can
not
carry
back
this
process
infinitely
for
in
that
case
one
would
never
decide
the
fixed
point
is
not
in
man
since
we
meet
in
him
as
a
being
apart
by
himself
only
the
alternative
faculties
we
must
therefore
recur
to
the
intervention
of
an
exterior
agent
who
shall
impress
on
our
will
a
movement
capable
of
putting
an
end
to
its
hesitations
that
exterior
agent
is
nothing
else
than
god
the
scheme
seems
to
differ
little
and
unwillingly
from
a
system
of
dynamics
as
modern
as
the
dynamo
even
in
the
prime
motor
from
the
moment
of
action
freedom
of
will
vanished
creation
was
not
successive
it
was
one
instantaneous
thought
and
act
identical
with
the
will
and
was
complete
and
unchangeable
from
end
to
end
including
time
as
one
of
its
functions
thomas
was
as
clear
as
possible
on
that
point
supposing
god
wills
anything
in
effect
he
can
not
will
not
to
will
it
because
his
will
can
not
change
he
wills
that
some
things
shall
be
contingent
and
others
necessary
but
he
wills
in
the
same
act
that
the
contingency
shall
be
necessary
they
are
contingent
because
god
has
willed
them
to
be
so
and
with
this
object
has
subjected
them
to
causes
which
are
so
in
the
same
way
he
wills
that
his
creation
shall
develop
itself
in
time
and
space
and
sequence
but
he
creates
these
conditions
as
well
as
the
events
he
creates
the
whole
in
one
act
complete
unchangeable
and
it
is
then
unfolded
like
a
rolling
panorama
with
its
predetermined
contingencies
man
free
choice
liberum
arbitrium
falls
easily
into
place
as
a
predetermined
contingency
god
is
the
first
cause
and
acts
in
all
secondary
causes
directly
but
while
he
acts
mechanically
on
the
rest
of
creation
as
far
as
is
known
he
acts
freely
at
one
point
and
this
free
action
remains
free
as
far
as
it
extends
on
that
line
man
freedom
derives
from
this
source
but
it
is
simply
apparent
as
far
as
he
is
a
cause
it
is
a
reflex
action
determined
by
a
new
agency
of
the
first
cause
however
abstruse
these
ideas
may
once
have
sounded
they
are
far
from
seeming
difficult
in
comparison
with
modern
theories
of
energy
indeed
measured
by
that
standard
the
only
striking
feature
of
saint
thomas
motor
is
its
simplicity
thomas
prime
motor
was
very
powerful
and
its
lines
of
energy
were
infinite
among
these
infinite
lines
a
certain
group
ran
to
the
human
race
and
as
long
as
the
conduction
was
perfect
each
man
acted
mechanically
in
cases
where
the
current
for
any
reason
was
for
a
moment
checked
that
is
to
say
produced
the
effect
of
hesitation
or
reflection
in
the
mind
the
current
accumulated
until
it
acquired
power
to
leap
the
obstacle
as
saint
thomas
expressed
it
the
prime
motor
who
was
nothing
else
than
god
intervened
to
decide
the
channel
of
the
current
the
only
difference
between
man
and
a
vegetable
was
the
reflex
action
of
the
complicated
mirror
which
was
called
mind
and
the
mark
of
mind
was
reflective
absorption
or
choice
the
apparent
freedom
was
an
illusion
arising
from
the
extreme
delicacy
of
the
machine
but
the
motive
power
was
in
fact
the
same
that
of
god
this
exclusion
of
what
men
commonly
called
freedom
was
carried
still
further
in
the
process
of
explaining
dogma
supposing
the
conduction
to
be
insufficient
for
a
given
purpose
a
purpose
which
shall
require
perfect
conduction
under
ordinary
circumstances
in
cases
out
of
a
hundred
the
conductor
will
be
burned
out
so
to
speak
condemned
and
thrown
away
this
is
the
case
with
most
human
beings
yet
there
are
cases
where
the
conductor
is
capable
of
receiving
an
increase
of
energy
from
the
prime
motor
which
enables
it
to
attain
the
object
aimed
at
in
dogma
this
store
of
reserved
energy
is
technically
called
grace
in
the
strict
theological
sense
of
the
word
as
it
is
used
by
saint
thomas
the
exact
literal
meaning
of
grace
is
a
motion
which
the
prime
motor
as
a
supernatural
cause
produces
in
the
soul
perfecting
free
will
it
is
a
reserved
energy
which
comes
to
aid
and
reinforce
the
normal
energy
of
the
battery
to
religious
minds
this
scientific
inversion
of
solemn
truths
seems
and
is
sacrilege
but
thomas
numerous
critics
in
the
church
have
always
brought
precisely
this
charge
against
his
doctrine
and
are
doing
so
still
they
insist
that
he
has
reduced
god
to
a
mechanism
and
man
to
a
passive
conductor
of
force
he
has
left
they
say
nothing
but
god
in
the
universe
the
terrible
word
which
annihilates
all
other
philosophical
systems
against
which
it
is
hurled
has
been
hurled
freely
against
his
for
six
hundred
years
and
more
without
visibly
affecting
the
church
and
yet
its
propriety
seems
to
the
vulgar
beyond
reasonable
cavil
to
father
de
regnon
of
the
extremely
learned
and
intelligent
society
of
jesus
the
difference
between
pantheism
and
thomism
reduces
itself
to
this
pantheism
starting
from
the
notion
of
an
infinite
substance
which
is
the
plenitude
of
being
concludes
that
there
can
exist
no
other
beings
than
the
being
no
other
realities
than
the
absolute
reality
thomism
starting
from
the
efficacy
of
the
first
cause
tends
to
reduce
more
and
more
the
efficacy
of
second
causes
and
to
replace
it
by
a
passivity
which
receives
without
producing
which
is
determined
without
determining
to
students
of
architecture
who
know
equally
little
about
pantheism
and
about
thomism
or
indeed
for
that
matter
about
architecture
too
the
quality
that
rouses
most
surprise
in
thomism
is
its
astonishingly
scientific
method
the
franciscans
and
the
jesuits
call
it
pantheism
but
science
too
is
pantheism
or
has
till
very
recently
been
wholly
pantheistic
avowedly
science
has
aimed
at
nothing
but
the
reduction
of
multiplicity
to
unity
and
has
excommunicated
as
though
it
were
itself
a
church
any
one
who
doubted
or
disputed
its
object
its
method
or
its
results
the
effort
is
as
evident
and
quite
as
laborious
in
modern
science
starting
as
it
does
from
multiplicity
as
in
thomas
aquinas
who
started
from
unity
and
it
is
necessarily
less
successful
for
its
true
aims
as
far
as
it
is
science
and
not
disguised
religion
were
equally
attained
by
reaching
infinite
complexity
but
the
assertion
or
assumption
of
ultimate
unity
has
characterized
the
law
of
energy
as
emphatically
as
it
has
characterized
the
definition
of
god
in
theology
if
it
is
a
reproach
to
saint
thomas
it
is
equally
a
reproach
to
in
truth
it
is
what
men
most
admire
in
both
the
power
of
broad
and
lofty
generalization
under
any
conceivable
system
the
process
of
getting
god
and
man
under
the
same
roof
of
bringing
two
independent
energies
under
the
same
control
required
a
painful
effort
as
science
has
much
cause
to
know
no
doubt
many
good
christians
and
some
heretics
have
been
shocked
at
the
tour
de
force
by
which
they
felt
themselves
suddenly
seized
bound
hand
and
foot
attached
to
each
other
and
dragged
into
the
church
without
consent
or
consultation
to
religious
mystics
whose
scepticism
concerned
chiefly
themselves
and
their
own
existence
saint
thomas
man
seemed
hardly
worth
herding
at
so
much
expense
and
trouble
into
a
church
where
he
was
not
eager
to
go
true
religion
felt
the
nearness
of
god
without
caring
to
see
the
mechanism
mystics
like
saint
bernard
saint
francis
saint
bonaventure
or
pascal
had
a
right
to
make
this
objection
since
they
got
into
the
church
so
to
speak
by
breaking
through
the
windows
but
society
at
large
accepted
and
retains
saint
man
much
as
saint
thomas
delivered
him
to
the
government
a
sided
being
free
or
unfree
responsible
or
irresponsible
an
energy
or
a
victim
of
energy
moved
by
choice
or
moved
by
compulsion
as
the
interests
of
society
seemed
for
the
moment
to
need
certainly
saint
thomas
lavished
no
excess
of
liberty
on
the
man
he
created
but
still
he
was
more
generous
than
the
state
has
ever
been
saint
thomas
asked
little
from
man
and
gave
much
even
as
much
freedom
of
will
as
the
state
gave
or
now
gives
he
added
immortality
hereafter
and
eternal
happiness
under
reasonable
restraints
his
god
watched
over
man
temporal
welfare
far
more
anxiously
than
the
state
has
ever
done
and
assigned
him
space
in
the
church
which
he
never
can
have
in
the
galleries
of
parliament
or
congress
more
than
all
this
saint
thomas
and
his
god
placed
man
in
the
centre
of
the
universe
and
made
the
sun
and
the
stars
for
his
uses
no
statute
law
ever
did
as
much
for
man
and
no
social
reform
ever
will
try
to
do
it
yet
man
bitterly
complained
that
he
had
not
his
rights
and
even
in
the
church
is
still
complaining
because
saint
thomas
set
a
limit
more
or
less
vague
to
what
the
man
was
obstinate
in
calling
his
freedom
of
will
thus
saint
thomas
completed
his
work
keeping
his
converging
lines
clear
and
pure
throughout
and
bringing
them
together
unbroken
in
the
curves
that
gave
unity
to
his
plan
his
sense
of
scale
and
proportion
was
that
of
the
great
architects
of
his
age
one
might
go
on
studying
it
for
a
lifetime
he
showed
no
more
hesitation
in
keeping
his
deity
in
scale
than
in
adjusting
man
to
it
strange
as
it
sounds
although
man
thought
himself
hardly
treated
in
respect
to
freedom
yet
if
freedom
meant
superiority
man
was
in
action
much
the
superior
of
god
whose
freedom
suffered
from
saint
thomas
under
restraints
that
man
never
would
have
tolerated
saint
thomas
did
not
allow
god
even
an
undetermined
will
he
was
pure
act
and
as
such
he
could
not
change
man
alone
was
allowed
in
act
to
change
direction
what
was
more
curious
still
man
might
absolutely
prove
his
freedom
by
refusing
to
move
at
all
if
he
did
not
like
his
life
he
could
stop
it
and
habitually
did
so
or
acquiesced
in
its
being
done
for
him
while
god
could
not
commit
suicide
or
even
cease
for
a
single
instant
his
continuous
action
if
man
had
the
singular
fancy
of
making
himself
absurd
a
taste
confined
to
himself
but
attested
by
evidence
exceedingly
strong
he
could
be
as
absurd
as
he
liked
but
god
could
not
be
absurd
saint
thomas
did
not
allow
the
deity
the
right
to
contradict
himself
which
is
one
of
man
chief
pleasures
while
man
enjoyed
what
was
for
his
purposes
an
unlimited
freedom
to
be
wicked
a
privilege
which
as
both
church
and
state
bitterly
complained
and
still
complain
he
has
outrageously
abused
god
was
goodness
and
could
be
nothing
else
while
man
moved
about
his
relatively
spacious
prison
with
a
certain
degree
of
ease
god
being
everywhere
could
not
move
in
one
respect
at
least
man
freedom
seemed
to
be
not
relative
but
absolute
for
his
thought
was
an
energy
paying
no
regard
to
space
or
time
or
order
or
object
or
sense
but
god
thought
was
his
act
and
will
at
once
speaking
correctly
god
could
not
think
he
is
saint
thomas
would
not
or
could
not
admit
that
god
was
necessity
as
abelard
seems
to
have
held
but
he
refused
to
tolerate
the
idea
of
a
divine
maniac
free
from
moral
obligation
to
himself
the
atmosphere
of
saint
louis
surrounds
the
god
of
saint
thomas
and
its
pure
ether
shuts
out
the
corruption
and
pollution
to
come
the
valois
and
bourbons
the
occams
and
hobbes
the
tudors
and
the
medicis
of
an
enlightened
europe
the
theology
turns
always
into
art
at
the
last
and
ends
in
aspiration
the
spire
justifies
the
church
in
saint
church
man
free
will
was
the
aspiration
to
god
and
he
treated
it
as
the
architects
of
chartres
and
laon
had
treated
their
famous
fleches
the
square
the
expression
of
god
power
in
act
his
creation
rose
to
the
level
of
the
church
facade
as
a
part
of
the
normal
unity
of
god
energy
and
then
suddenly
without
show
of
effort
without
break
without
logical
violence
became
a
voluntary
vanishing
human
soul
and
neither
villard
de
honnecourt
nor
duns
scotus
could
distinguish
where
power
ends
and
man
free
will
begins
all
they
saw
was
the
soul
vanishing
into
the
skies
how
it
was
done
one
does
not
care
to
ask
in
a
result
so
exquisite
one
has
not
the
heart
to
find
fault
with
adresse
about
saint
thomas
theology
we
need
not
greatly
disturb
ourselves
it
can
matter
now
not
much
whether
he
put
more
pantheism
than
the
law
allowed
or
more
materialism
than
duns
scotus
approved
or
less
of
either
into
his
universe
since
the
church
is
still
on
the
spot
responsible
for
its
own
doctrines
but
his
architecture
is
another
matter
so
scientific
and
structural
a
method
was
never
an
accident
or
the
property
of
a
single
mind
even
with
aristotle
to
prompt
it
neither
his
church
nor
the
architect
church
was
a
sketch
but
a
completely
studied
structure
every
relation
of
parts
every
disturbance
of
equilibrium
every
detail
of
construction
was
treated
with
infinite
labour
as
the
result
of
two
hundred
years
of
experiment
and
discussion
among
thousands
of
men
whose
minds
and
whose
instincts
were
acute
and
who
discussed
little
else
science
and
art
were
one
thomas
aquinas
would
probably
have
built
a
better
cathedral
at
beauvais
than
the
actual
architect
who
planned
it
but
it
is
quite
likely
that
the
architect
might
have
saved
thomas
some
of
his
errors
as
pointed
out
by
the
councils
of
both
were
great
artists
perhaps
in
their
professions
the
greatest
that
ever
lived
and
both
must
have
been
great
students
beyond
their
practice
both
were
subject
to
constant
criticism
from
men
and
bodies
of
men
whose
minds
were
as
acute
and
whose
learning
was
as
great
as
their
own
if
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
and
the
bishop
of
paris
condemned
thomas
the
bernardines
had
for
near
two
hundred
years
condemned
beauvais
in
advance
both
the
summa
theologiae
and
beauvais
cathedral
were
excessively
modern
scientific
and
technical
marking
the
extreme
points
reached
by
europe
on
the
lines
of
scholastic
science
this
is
all
we
need
to
know
if
we
like
we
can
go
on
to
study
inch
by
inch
the
slow
decline
of
the
art
the
essence
of
it
the
despotic
central
idea
was
that
of
organic
unity
both
in
the
thought
and
the
building
from
that
time
the
universe
has
steadily
become
more
complex
and
less
reducible
to
a
central
control
with
as
much
obstinacy
as
though
it
were
human
it
has
insisted
on
expanding
its
parts
with
as
much
elusiveness
as
though
it
were
feminine
it
has
evaded
the
attempt
to
impose
on
it
a
single
will
modern
science
like
modern
art
tends
in
practice
to
drop
the
dogma
of
organic
unity
some
of
the
mediaeval
habit
of
mind
survives
but
even
that
is
said
to
be
yielding
before
the
daily
evidence
of
increasing
and
extending
complexity
the
fault
then
was
not
in
man
if
he
no
longer
looked
at
science
or
art
as
an
organic
whole
or
as
the
expression
of
unity
unity
turned
itself
into
complexity
multiplicity
variety
and
even
contradiction
all
experience
human
and
divine
assured
man
in
the
thirteenth
century
that
the
lines
of
the
universe
converged
how
was
he
to
know
that
these
lines
ran
in
every
conceivable
and
inconceivable
direction
and
that
at
least
half
of
them
seemed
to
diverge
from
any
imaginable
centre
of
unity
dimly
conscious
that
his
trinity
required
in
logic
a
fourth
dimension
how
was
the
schoolman
to
supply
it
when
even
the
mathematician
of
can
only
infer
its
necessity
naturally
man
tended
to
lose
his
sense
of
scale
and
relation
a
straight
line
or
a
combination
of
straight
lines
may
have
still
a
sort
of
artistic
unity
but
what
can
be
done
in
art
with
a
series
of
negative
symbols
even
if
the
negative
were
continuous
the
artist
might
express
at
least
a
negation
but
supposing
that
omar
kinetic
analogy
of
the
ball
and
the
players
turned
out
to
be
a
scientific
formula
supposing
that
the
highest
scientific
authority
in
order
to
obtain
any
unity
at
all
had
to
resort
to
the
middle
ages
for
an
imaginary
demon
to
sort
his
atoms
how
could
art
deal
with
such
problems
and
what
wonder
that
art
lost
unity
with
philosophy
and
science
art
had
to
be
confused
in
order
to
express
confusion
but
perhaps
it
was
truest
so
some
future
summer
when
you
are
older
and
when
i
have
left
like
omar
only
the
empty
glass
of
my
scholasticism
for
you
to
turn
down
you
can
amuse
yourselves
by
going
on
with
the
story
after
the
death
of
saint
louis
saint
thomas
and
william
of
lorris
and
after
the
failure
of
beauvais
the
pathetic
interest
of
the
drama
deepens
with
every
new
expression
but
at
least
you
can
learn
from
it
that
your
parents
in
the
nineteenth
century
were
not
to
blame
for
losing
the
sense
of
unity
in
art
as
early
as
the
fourteenth
century
signs
of
unsteadiness
appeared
and
before
the
eighteenth
century
unity
became
only
a
reminiscence
the
old
habit
of
centralizing
a
strain
at
one
point
and
then
dividing
and
subdividing
it
and
distributing
it
on
visible
lines
of
support
to
a
visible
foundation
disappeared
in
architecture
soon
after
but
lingered
in
theology
two
centuries
longer
and
even
in
very
communities
far
down
to
our
own
time
but
its
values
were
forgotten
and
it
survived
chiefly
as
a
stock
jest
against
the
clergy
the
passage
between
the
two
epochs
is
as
beautiful
as
the
slave
of
michael
angelo
but
to
feel
its
beauty
you
should
see
it
from
above
as
it
came
from
its
radiant
source
truth
indeed
may
not
exist
science
avers
it
to
be
only
a
relation
but
what
men
took
for
truth
stares
one
everywhere
in
the
eye
and
begs
for
sympathy
the
architects
of
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
took
the
church
and
the
universe
for
truths
and
tried
to
express
them
in
a
structure
which
should
be
final
knowing
by
an
enormous
experience
precisely
where
the
strains
were
to
come
they
enlarged
their
scale
to
the
utmost
point
of
material
endurance
lightening
the
load
and
distributing
the
burden
until
the
gutters
and
gargoyles
that
seem
mere
ornament
and
the
grotesques
that
seem
rude
absurdities
all
do
work
either
for
the
arch
or
for
the
eye
and
every
inch
of
material
up
and
down
from
crypt
to
vault
from
man
to
god
from
the
universe
to
the
atom
had
its
task
giving
support
where
support
was
needed
or
weight
where
concentration
was
felt
but
always
with
the
condition
of
showing
conspicuously
to
the
eye
the
great
lines
which
led
to
unity
and
the
curves
which
controlled
divergence
so
that
from
the
cross
on
the
fleche
and
the
keystone
of
the
vault
down
through
the
ribbed
nervures
the
columns
the
windows
to
the
foundation
of
the
flying
buttresses
far
beyond
the
walls
one
idea
controlled
every
line
and
this
is
true
of
saint
thomas
church
as
it
is
of
amiens
cathedral
the
method
was
the
same
for
both
and
the
result
was
an
art
marked
by
singular
unity
which
endured
and
served
its
purpose
until
man
changed
his
attitude
toward
the
universe
the
trouble
was
not
in
the
art
or
the
method
or
the
structure
but
in
the
universe
itself
which
presented
different
aspects
as
man
moved
granted
a
church
saint
thomas
church
was
the
most
expressive
that
man
has
made
and
the
great
gothic
cathedrals
were
its
most
complete
expression
perhaps
the
best
proof
of
it
is
their
apparent
instability
of
all
the
elaborate
symbolism
which
has
been
suggested
for
the
gothic
cathedral
the
most
vital
and
most
perfect
may
be
that
the
slender
nervure
the
springing
motion
of
the
broken
arch
the
leap
downwards
of
the
flying
buttress
the
visible
effort
to
throw
off
a
visible
strain
never
let
us
forget
that
faith
alone
supports
it
and
that
if
faith
fails
heaven
is
lost
the
equilibrium
is
visibly
delicate
beyond
the
line
of
safety
danger
lurks
in
every
stone
the
peril
of
the
heavy
tower
of
the
restless
vault
of
the
vagrant
buttress
the
uncertainty
of
logic
the
inequalities
of
the
syllogism
the
irregularities
of
the
mental
mirror
all
these
haunting
nightmares
of
the
church
are
expressed
as
strongly
by
the
gothic
cathedral
as
though
it
had
been
the
cry
of
human
suffering
and
as
no
emotion
had
ever
been
expressed
before
or
is
likely
to
find
expression
again
the
delight
of
its
aspirations
is
flung
up
to
the
sky
the
pathos
of
its
and
anguish
of
doubt
is
buried
in
the
earth
as
its
last
secret
you
can
read
out
of
it
whatever
else
pleases
your
youth
and
confidence
to
me
this
is
all
the
end
