has

engaged
to
fay
eaton
and
in
his
enthusiasm
induces
her
to
stay
and
have
dinner
in

cabin
this
is
met
with
stern
disapproval
by
chaperon
charlotte
hopkinson
who
insists
that
they
leave
at
once
charlotte
however
gets
shut
up
in
the
compass
room
and
a
gay
young
american
widow
accepts
the
offer
to
take
her
place
both
girls
intending
to
go
back
to
shore
in
the
late
evening
of
course
things
go
wrong
and
they
have
to
remain
aboard
all
night
by
this
time
the
captain
has
to
be
told
because
his
cabin
contains
the
only
possible
accommodations
and
he
enters
into
the
conspiracy
without
signalling
the
admiral
flagship
then
the
falcon
is
suddenly
ordered
to
sea
and
the
admiral
decides
to
sail
with
her
this
also
makes
necessary
the
turning
over
to
him
of
the
quarters
the
presence
of
the
ladies
now
becomes
positively
embarrassing
the
girls
are
bundled
into
one
cabin
just
opposite
that
occupied
by
the
admiral
the
game
of
with
a
marine
sentry
in
stockinged
feet
is
very
funny

so
are

attempts

a

what
christmas
time
to
you

a
time
for
paying
bills
without
money
a
time
for
finding
yourself
a
year
older
and
not
an
hour
richer
if
i
could
work
my
will
every
idiot
who
goes
about
with
merry
christmas
on
his
lips
should
be
boiled
with
his

pudding
and
buried
with
a
stake
of
holly
through
his
heart
he
should
frank
uncle
scr

might
have
derived
good
by
which
i
have
not
profited
i
dare
say
christmas
among
the
rest
but
i
am
sure
i
have
always
thought
of
christmas
time
when
it
has
come
round
as
a
good
time
a
kind
forgiving
charitable
pleasant
time
the
only
time
i
know
of
in
the
long
calendar
of
the
year
when
men
and
women
seem
by
one
consent
to
open
their
shut
up
hearts
freely
and
to
think
of
people
below
them
as
if
they
really
were
fellow
passengers
to
the
grave
and
not
another
race
of
creatures
bound
on
other
journeys
and
therefore
uncle
though
it
has
not
put
a
scrap
of
gold
or
silver
in
my
pocket
i
believe
that
it
has
done
me
good
and
will
do
me
good
and
i
say
heaven
bless
it

these
seven
years

at
this
festive
season

looks
up
that
noise

i
wo
believe

that
the
spirit
within

should
walk
abroad
among
his
fellow
men
and
travel
far
and
wide
if

bob
cratchit
enters
with
tiny
tim
upon
his
shoulder
bob
why
where
our
martha
not
coming
bob
not
coming
upon
christmas
day
martha
towards
yes
dear
father
yes
children
come
tiny
tim
into
the
washhouse
to
hear
the
pudding
singing
in
the
copper
carry
tim
out
peter
exits
and
how
did
little
tim
behave
bob
as
good
as
gold
somehow
he
gets
thoughtful
sitting
by
himself
so
much
and
thinks
the
sweetest
things
you
ever
heard
children
with
children
the
goose
the
goose
carrying
the
goose
it
is
placed
on
the
table
etc
all
seat
themselves
at
scr
bob
happier
than
his
master
how
his
blessed
urchins
mounting
guard
upon
their
posts
cram
their
spoons
into
their
mouths
lest
they
should
shriek
for
goose
before
their
turn
arrives
to
be
helped
and
now
as
cratchit
plunges
her
knife
in
its
breast
a
murmur
of
delight
arises
round
the
board
and
even
tiny
tim
beats
the
table
with
the
handle
of
his
knife
and
feebly
cries
hurrah
bob
beautiful
there
never
was
such
a
goose
it
tender
as
a
lamb
and
cheap
as
dirt
the
apple
sauce
and
mashed
potatoes
are
delicious
and
now
love
for
the
pudding
the
thought
of
it
makes
you
nervous
too
nervous
for
witnesses
i
must
leave
the
room
alone
to
take
the
pudding
up
and
bring
it
in
bob
awful
moment
suppose
it
should
not
be
done
enough
suppose
it
should
break
in
turning
out
suppose
somebody
should
have
got
over
the
wall
of
the
back
yard
and
stolen
it
up
and
walks
about
i
could
suppose
all
sorts
of
horrors
ah
there
a
great
deal
of
steam
the
pudding
out
of
the
copper
a
smell
like
a
washing
day
that
the
cloth
a
smell
like
an
and
a
pastry
door
to
each
other
with
a
laundress
next
door
to
that
that
the
pudding
cratchit
with
pudding
which
she
places
on
table
bob
children
hurrah
scr
cratchit
looks
flushed
but
smiles
proudly
like
one
who
has
achieved
a
triumph
bob
cratchit
i
regard
this
pudding
as
the
greatest
success
you
have
achieved
since
our
marriage
now
that
the
weight
off
my
mind
i
confess
i
had
my
doubts
about
it
and
i
do
think
it
at
all
a
small
pudding
for
so
large
a
family
bob
it
would
be
flat
heresy
to
say
so
a
cratchit
would
blush
to
hint
at
such
a
thing
scr
their
merry
cheerful
dinner
ended
but
not
their
sweet
enjoyment
of
the
day
cratchit
clears
the
table
a
jug
and
a
glass
or
two
are
placed
on
it
bob
fills
the
bob
a
merry
christmas
to
us
all
my
dear
heaven
bless
us
drink
and
echo
him
tiny
tim
is
near
his
father
who
presses
his
scr
spirit
tell
me
if
tiny
tim
will
live
spirit
if
the
shadows
i
see
remain
unaltered
by
the
future
the
child
will
die
scr
no
no
say
he
will
be
spared
spirit
if
he
be
like
to
die
what
then
he
had
better
do
it
and
decrease
the
surplus
population
scr
my
own
words
spirit
man
if
man
you
be
in
heart
and
not
adamant
forbear
that
wicked
cant
until
you
have
discovered
what
the
surplus
is
and
where
it
is
will
you
decide
what
men
shall
live
what
men
shall
die
to
hear
the
insect
on
the
leaf
pronouncing
on
the
too
much
life
among
his
hungry
brothers
in
the
dust
bob
my
dear

founder
of

a
gloom
upon
them
but

and
they
look
happier
yet
in
the
bright
sprinkling
of
thy
torch
spirit
he
speaks
the
stage
becomes
quite
dark
a
medium
descends
which
hides
the
group
at
table
scrooge
and
the
spirit
remaining
in
we
have
seen
much
and
visited
many
homes
thou
hast
stood
beside
sick
beds
and
they
were
cheerful
by
struggling
men
and
they
were
patient
in
their
greater
hope
by
poverty
and
it
was
rich
in
almshouse
hospital
and
jail
in
misery
every
refuge
thou
hast
left
thy
blessing
and
taught
me
thy
precepts
spirit
my
life
upon
this
globe
is
very
brief
it
ends
at
midnight
the
time
draws
near

a
claw
protruding
from
your
skirts

wretched
in

disappears
through

at
the

time
before

slightly
inclines
its
though
well
used
to
ghostly
company
by
this
time

more
than

ai
good
enough
for

points
onward
the
scene
scene

drawn
over

points
to

then
approaches

followed
by
scrooge
trembling
the
curtain
is
withdrawn
a
bed
is
seen
a
pale
light
shows
a
figure
covered
with
a
sheet
upon
scr
in
ah
a
bare
uncurtained
bed
and
something
there
which
though
dumb
announces
itself
in
awful

and
bereft
unwatched
unwept
uncared

be
raised
up
and
see
himself

hard
dealing
griping

have
brought
him
to
a
rich
end
