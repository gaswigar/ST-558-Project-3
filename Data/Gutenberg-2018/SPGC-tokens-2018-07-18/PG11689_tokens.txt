have
you
heard
the
news
of
charity
and
grace
look
look
how
joy
and
gratitude
are
beaming
in
my
face
for
webb
is
not
opposed
to
woman
in
her
place
o
webb
how
kind
you
are
to
let
us
live
at
all
to
let
us
light
the
kitchen
range
and
tidy
up
the
hall
to
tolerate
the
female
sex
in
spite
of
adam
fall
o
girls
suppose
that
webb
should
alter
his
decree
suppose
he
were
opposed
to
us
opposed
to
you
and
me
what
would
be
left
for
us
to
do
except
to
cease
to
be
lines
to
bowdle
of
ohio
the
women
of
this
smart
capital
are
beautiful
their
beauty
is
disturbing
to
business
their
feet
are
beautiful
their
ankles
are
beautiful
but
here
i
must
bowdle
speech
in
congress
january
you
who
despise
the
fairer
sex
be
brave
there
really
is
any
reason
you
should
not
if
you
wish
oppose
and
vex
and
scold
us
in
and
even
out
of
season
but
do
regard
it
as
your
bounden
duty
to
open
with
a
tribute
to
our
beauty
say
if
you
like
that
women
have
no
sense
no
no
power
of
concentration
say
that
hysterics
is
our
one
defence
our
virtue
but
an
absence
of
temptation
these
i
can
bear
but
oh
i
own
it
rankles
to
hear
you
maundering
on
about
our
ankles
tell
those
old
stories
which
have
now
and
then
been
from
the
record
thoughtfully
deleted
repeat
that
favorite
one
about
the
hen
repeat
the
ones
that
can
not
be
repeated
but
in
the
midst
of
such
enjoyments
smother
the
impulse
to
extol
your
sainted
mother
on
not
believing
all
you
hear
women
are
angels
they
are
jewels
they
are
queens
and
princesses
of
our
hearts
speech
of
carter
of
angel
or
jewel
or
princess
or
queen
tell
me
immediately
where
have
you
been
i
been
to
ask
all
my
slaves
so
devoted
why
they
against
my
enfranchisement
voted
angel
and
princess
that
action
was
wrong
back
to
the
kitchen
where
angels
belong
the
revolt
of
mother
every
true
woman
feels
of
almost
any
i
am
and
i
think
it
right
that
man
should
know
by
nature
laws
eternal
the
proper
way
to
rule
to
earn
to
fight
and
exercise
those
functions
called
paternal
but
even
i
a
little
bit
rebel
at
finding
that
he
knows
my
job
as
well
at
least
he
always
ready
to
expound
it
especially
in
legislative
hall
the
joys
the
cares
the
halos
that
surround
it
how
women
feel
he
knows
that
best
of
all
in
fact
his
thesis
is
that
no
one
can
know
what
is
womanly
except
a
man
i
am
and
i
am
content
when
he
explains
the
world
of
art
and
science
and
government
to
him
divinely
sent
i
drink
it
in
with
ladylike
compliance
but
can
not
listen
no
i
only
human
while
he
instructs
me
how
to
be
a
woman

gallant
sex
a

engineer

been
dismissed
by
the
board
of
education
under
their
new
rule
that
women
shall
not
attend
high
pressure
boilers
although
her
work
has
been
satisfactory
and
she
holds
a
license
to
attend
such
boilers
from
the
police
department
lady
dangers
lurk

i
could
not
let
you
face
men
were
meant
to
be
the
toilers
home
you
know
is
woman
place
have
no
home
well
is
that
so
still
it
not
my
fault
you
know
charming
lady
work
no
more
fair
you
are
and
sweet
as
honey
work
might
make
your
fingers
sore
and
besides
i
need
the
money
prithee
rest
or
starve
or
rob
only
let
me
have
your
job
representation
my
wife
is
against
suffrage
and
that
settles
me
i
my
wife
dislikes
the
income
tax
and
so
i
can
not
pay
it
she
thinks
that
golf
all
interest
lacks
so
now
i
never
play
it
she
is
opposed
to
tolls
repeal
though
why
i
can
not
say
but
woman
duty
is
to
feel
and
man
is
to
obey
ii
i
in
a
hard
position
for
a
perfect
gentleman
i
want
to
please
the
ladies
but
i
do
see
how
i
can
my
present
wife
a
suffragist
and
counts
on
my
support
but
my
mother
is
an
anti
of
a
rather
biting
sort
one
grandmother
is
on
the
fence
the
other
much
opposed
and
my
sister
lives
in
oregon
and
thinks
the
question
closed
each
one
is
counting
on
my
vote
to
represent
her
view
now
what
should
you
think
proper
for
a
gentleman
to
do
sonnet
three
bills
known
as
the
cannery
bills
have
been
advanced
to
third
reading
in
the
senate
and
assembly
at
albany
one
permits
the
canners
to
work
their
employés
seven
days
a
week
a
second
allows
them
to
work
women
after
and
a
third
removes
every
restriction
upon
the
hours
of

of

and
minors

let
us
not
to
an
unrestricted
day
impediments
admit
work
is
not
work
to
our
employés
but
a
merry
play
they
do
not
ask
the
law
excuse
to
shirk
ah
no
the
canning
season
is
at
hand
when
summer
scents
are
on
the
air
distilled
when
golden
fruits
are
ripening
in
the
land
and
silvery
tins
are
gaping
to
be
filled
now
to
the
cannery
with

before
the
dawn
come
women
girls
and

whose
weekly
hours
a
hundred
and
nineteen
seem
all
too
short
for
their
industrious
joys
if
this
be
error
and
be
proved
alas
the
bills
may
fail
to
pass
to
president
wilson
i
hold
it
as
a
fundamental
principle
and
so
do
you
that
every
people
has
the
right
to
determine
its
own
form
of
government
and
until
recently
per
cent
of
the
people
of
mexico
have
not
had
a
in
determining
who
should
be
their
governors
or
what
their
government
should
be
of
president
wise
and
just
man
for
such
i
think
you
are
how
can
you
see
so
burningly
and
clear
injustices
and
tyrannies
afar
yet
blind
your
eyes
to
one
that
lies
so
near
how
can
you
plead
so
earnestly
for
men
who
fight
their
own
fight
with
a
bloody
hand
how
hold
their
cause
so
wildly
dear
and
then
forget
the
women
of
your
native
land
with
your
stern
ardor
and
your
scholar
word
you
speak
to
us
of
human
liberty
can
you
believe
that
women
are
not
stirred
by
this
same
human
longing
to
be
free
he
who
for
liberty
would
strike
a
blow
need
not
take

or
fly

vow
a
speaker
at
the
national
education
association
advised
girls
not
to
study
algebra
many
girls
he
said
had
lost
their
souls
through
this
study
the
idea
has
been
taken
up
with
enthusiasm
i
will
avoid
equations
and
shun
the
naughty

i
must
beware
the

through
it
young

assure
though
permutations
and
combinations
my

i
never
study

but
keep
my
spirit
pure
such
nonsense
where
on
earth
did
the
idea
come
from
that
the
ballot
is
a
boon
a
privilege
and
an
honor
from
prestonia
mann
who
is
it
thinks
the
vote
some
use
man
man
is
often
such
a
goose
indeed
it
makes
me
laugh
to
see
how
men
have
struggled
to
be
free
poor
washington
who
meant
so
well
and
nathan
hale
and
william
tell
hampden
and
bolivar
and
pym
and
remember
him
and
garibaldi
and
kossuth
and
some
who
threw
away
their
youth
all
bitten
by
the
stupid
notion
that
liberty
was
worth
emotion
they
could
not
get
it
through
their
heads
that
if
they
stayed
tucked
up
in
beds
avoiding
politics
and
strife
they
lead
a
pleasant
peaceful
life
let
us
dear
sisters
never
make
such
a
ridiculous
mistake
but
teach
our
children
and
that
liberty
is
just
a
chore
a
suggested
campaign
song
no
brass
bands
no
speeches
instead
a
still
silent
effective
influence
we
are
waging
can
you
doubt
it
a
campaign
so
calm
and
still
no
one
knows
a
thing
about
it
and
we
hope
they
never
will
no
one
knows
what
we
oppose
and
we
hope
they
never
will
we
are
ladylike
and
quiet
here
a
whisper
there
a
hint
never
speeches
bands
or
riot
nothing
suitable
for
print
no
one
knows
what
we
oppose
for
we
never
speak
for
print
sometimes
in
profound
seclusion
in
some
far
but
homelike
spot
we
will
make
a
dark
allusion
we
opposed
to
no
one
knows
what
we
oppose
for
we
call
it
the
woman
of
charm
i
hate
a
woman
who
is
not
a
mystery
to
herself
as
well
as
to
me
if
you
want
a
receipt
for
that
popular
mystery
known
to
the
world
as
a
woman
of
charm
take
all
the
conspicuous
ladies
of
history
mix
them
all
up
without
doing
them
harm
the
beauty
of
helen
the
warmth
of
cleopatra
salome
notorious
skill
in
the
dance
the
dusky
allure
of
the
belles
of
sumatra
the

and
finish
of
ladies
from
france
the
youth
of
susanna
beloved
by
an
elder
the
wit
of
a

incomparable
minx
the
conjugal
views
of
the

griselda
the
fire
of

the

all
down
in
a
pipkin
or
crucible
set
to
simmer
and
take
off
the

and
a

of

is
the
residuum
slightly
adapted
from
gilbert
a
modern
proposal
it
has
been
said
that
the
feminist
movement
is
the
true
solution
of
the
problem
sylvia
my

would
be
yours
with

all
that
you
are
seems
excellent

her

doctrine
fails
to
charm
her
there
are
the

guarding

would
keep

out

i
think
what
the
young

of

growing
up
to

too
many

around

the
protected

apologies
to
james
whitcomb
the
result
of
taking
second
place
to
girls
at
school
is
that
the

feels
a
sense
of
inferiority

tell
us
but

she
should
love
her

suffrage
to
women
is
repugnant
to
instincts
that
strike
their
roots
deep
in
the
order
of
nature
it
runs
counter
to
human
reason
it
flouts
the
teachings
of
experience
and
the
admonitions
of
common
times
oh
that
possible
after
those
words
inane
for
me
to
read
ever
again
when
i
was
wont
to
read
it
in
the
early
morning
hours
in
a
mood
wrath
and
mirth
i
exclaimed
alas
ye
powers
these
ideas
are
fainter
quainter
than
anything
on
earth
a
paper
laid
before
me
not
thou
not
like
to
thee
dear
me
if
it
were
possible
should
ever
see
how
very
far
the
times
have
moved
spelt
with
a
little
t
editorials
lovely
antiques
breathing
in
every
line
the
perfume
of
an
age
long
passed
away
wafting
us
back
to
museum
pieces
of
a
day
you
should
not
languish
in
the
public
press
where
modern
thought
might
reach
and
do
you
harm
and
vulgar
youth
insult
your
hoariness
missing
the
flavor
of
your
old
world
charm
you
should
be
locked
where
rust
can
not
corrode
in
some
old
rosewood
cabinet
dimmed
by
age
with
tortoise
shell
and
spode
and
all
would
cry
who
read
your
yellowing
page
yes
that
the
sort
of
thing
that
men
believed
before
the
first
reform
bill
was
conceived
campaign
material
both
our
own
twelve
reasons
because
no
woman
will
leave
her
domestic
duties
to
vote
because
no
woman
who
may
vote
will
attend
to
her
domestic
duties
because
it
will
make
dissension
between
husband
and
wife
because
every
woman
will
vote
as
her
husband
tells
her
to
because
bad
women
will
corrupt
politics
because
bad
politics
will
corrupt
women
because
women
have
no
power
of
organization
because
women
will
form
a
solid
party
and
outvote
men
because
men
and
women
are
so
different
that
they
must
stick
to
different
duties
because
men
and
women
are
so
much
alike
that
men
with
one
vote
each
can
represent
their
own
views
and
ours
too
because
women
can
not
use
force
because
the
militants
did
use
force
why
we
oppose
pockets
for
women
because
pockets
are
not
a
natural
right
because
the
great
majority
of
women
do
not
want
pockets
if
they
did
they
would
have
them
because
whenever
women
have
had
pockets
they
have
not
used
them
because
women
are
required
to
carry
enough
things
as
it
is
without
the
additional
burden
of
pockets
because
it
would
make
dissension
between
husband
and
wife
as
to
whose
pockets
were
to
be
filled
because
it
would
destroy
man
chivalry
toward
woman
if
he
did
not
have
to
carry
all
her
things
in
his
pockets
because
men
are
men
and
women
are
women
we
must
not
fly
in
the
face
of
nature
because
pockets
have
been
used
by
men
to
carry
tobacco
pipes
whiskey
flasks
chewing
gum
and
compromising
letters
we
see
no
reason
to
suppose
that
women
would
use
them
more
wisely
fashion
notes
past
and
present
arguments
are
being
worn
long
calm
and
flowing
this
year
with
the
dominant
note
that
of
woman
intellectual
inferiority
violence
is
very
evident
in
this
season
modes
and
our
more
conservative
thinkers
are
saying
that
woman
suffrage
threatens
the
home
the
church
and
the
republic
a
complete
change
of
style
has
taken
place
everything
is
being
worn
with
the
repeated
assertion
that
too
many
people
are
voting
already
the
best
line
of
goods
shown
by
the
leading
houses
this
spring
is
the
statement
that
woman
suffrage
is
the
same
thing
as
free
love
the
effect
is
extremely
piquant
and
surprising
why
we
oppose
women
travelling
in
railway
trains
because
travelling
in
trains
is
not
a
natural
right
because
our
never
asked
to
travel
in
trains
because
woman
place
is
the
home
not
the
train
because
it
is
unnecessary
there
is
no
point
reached
by
a
train
that
can
not
be
reached
on
foot
because
it
will
double
the
work
of
conductors
engineers
and
brakemen
who
are
already
overburdened
because
men
smoke
and
play
cards
in
trains
is
there
any
reason
to
believe
that
women
will
behave
better
why
we
oppose
schools
for
children
the
children
because
education
is
a
burden
not
a
right
because
not
of
one
per
cent
of
the
children
of
this
country
have
demanded
education
because
if
we
are
educated
we
should
have
to
behave
as
if
we
were
and
we
do
want
to
because
it
is
essentially
against
the
nature
of
a
child
to
be
educated
because
we
ca
see
that
it
has
done
so
much
for
and
there
is
no
reason
for
thinking
it
will
make
children
perfect
because
the
time
of
children
is
already
sufficiently
occupied
without
going
to
school
because
it
would
make
dissension
between
parent
and
child
imagine
the
home
life
of
a
parent
who
turned
out
to
be
more
ignorant
than
his
or
her
child
because
we
believe
in
the
indirect
education
of
the
theatre
the
baseball
field
and
the
moving
picture
we
believe
that
schools
would
in
a
great
measure
deprive
us
of
this
because
our
parents
went
to
school
they
love
us
they
take
care
of
us
they
tell
us
what
to
do
we
are
content
that
they
should
be
educated
for
us
but
then
who
cares
for
figures
an
argument
sometimes
used
against
paying
women
as
highly
as
men
for
the
same
work
is
that
women
are
only
temporarily
in
industry
per
cent
of
the
women
teachers
in
the
public
schools
of
new
york
have
been
more
than
ten
years
in
the
service
while
only
per
cent
of
the
men
teachers
have
served
as
long
the
bundesrath
of
germany
has
decided
to
furnish
medical
and
financial
assistance
to
women
at
the
time
of
childbirth
in
order
to
alleviate
the
anxiety
of
husbands
at
the
front
how
strange
this
would
sound
the
bundesrath
has
decided
to
furnish
medical
assistance
to
the
wounded
at
the
front
in
order
to
alleviate
the
anxiety
of
wives
and
mothers
at
home
when
a
benefit
is
suggested
for
men
the
question
asked
is
will
it
benefit
men
when
a
benefit
is
suggested
for
women
the
question
is
will
it
benefit
men
why
we
oppose
votes
for
men
because
man
place
is
the
armory
because
no
really
manly
man
wants
to
settle
any
question
otherwise
than
by
fighting
about
it
because
if
men
should
adopt
peaceable
methods
women
will
no
longer
look
up
to
them
because
men
will
lose
their
charm
if
they
step
out
of
their
natural
sphere
and
interest
themselves
in
other
matters
than
feats
of
arms
uniforms
and
drums
because
men
are
too
emotional
to
vote
their
conduct
at
baseball
games
and
political
conventions
shows
this
while
their
innate
tendency
to
appeal
to
force
renders
them
peculiarly
unfit
for
the
task
of
government
the
logic
of
the
law
in
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
in
denying
the
petition
of
women
to
practise
before
it
said
it
would
be
shocking
to
man
reverence
for
womanhood
and
faith
in
woman
that
woman
should
be
permitted
to
mix
professionally
in
all
the
nastiness
which
finds
its
way
into
courts
of
justice
it
then
names
thirteen
subjects
as
unfit
for
the
attention
of
women
three
of
them
are
crimes
committed
against
women
consistency
vile
insults
lewd
talk
and
brutal
conduct
were
used
by
the
indicted
men
to
frighten
respectable
women

no
sir
they
are
perfectly
orderly
tut
tut
go
there
at
once
and
swear
and
be
brutal
or
what
will
become
of
our
argument
sometimes
we
ivy
and
sometimes
we
oak
is
it
true
that
the
english
government
is
calling
on
women
to
do
work
abandoned

yes

is
not

not
when

outside

she

oh
yes
indeed
when
as
soon
as

want
their
jobs
back
again
do
you
know

that
the
president

to
give
the

won
that
the
undergraduates
insulted

allowed

compete
for

that
the

stoned
in

streets

finally
excluded
from

declared

the

the

every

you
meet
your
tailor
your
postman
your
grocer
as
well
as
your
that
you
are
opposed
to

we
hope
that
the
sewing

the
saleswomen
the

operatives
the
knitting
and
silk
mill
girls
the
women
janitors
and
cleaners
the
to
say
nothing
of
the
other

and

in

in
new
york
state
will
remember
when
they
have
drawn
off
their
long
gloves
and
tasted
their
oysters
to
tell
their
dinner
partners
that
they
are
opposed
to
woman
suffrage
because
they
fear
it
might
take
women
out
of
the
home
women
sphere
many
men
to
any
woman
if
you
have
beauty
charm
refinement
tact
if
you
can
prove
that
should
i
set
you
free
you
would
not
contemplate
the
smallest
act
that
might
annoy
or
interfere
with
me
if
you
can
show
that
women
will
abide
by
the
best
standards
of
their
womanhood
and
i
must
be
the
person
to
decide
what
in
a
woman
is
the
highest
good
if
you
display
efficiency
supreme
in
philanthropic
work
devoid
of
pay
if
you
can
show
a
clearly
scheme
for
bringing
the
millennium
in
a
day
why
then
dear
lady
at
some
time
remote
i
might
consider
giving
you
the
vote
a
sex
difference
when
men
in
congress
come
to
blows
at
something
someone
said
i
always
notice
that
it
shows
their
blood
is
quick
and
red
but
if
two
women
disagree
with
very
little
noise
it
proves
and
this
seems
strange
to
me
that
women
have
no
poise
advice
to
heroines
i
a
heroine
must
shrink
and
cling
when
heroes
are
about
and
thus
the
watching
world
will
think
how
brave
his
heart
and
stout
but
if
he
chance
to
be
away
when
dangers
shine
it
will
be
best
for
her
to
play
the
not
the
vine
in
fact
the
most
important
thing
is
knowing
when
it
time
to
cling
ii
apologies
to
a
heroine
must
be
polite
and
do
what
others
say
is
right
and
think
men
wise
and
formidable
at
least
as
far
as
she
is
able
mutual
vows
my
dear
he
said
observe
this
frightful
bill
run
up
i
think
you
own
against
my
will
if
you
will
recollect
our
wedding
day
you
vowed
on
that
occasion
to
obey
i
do
recall
the
day
said
she
and
how
me
with
your
worldly
goods
you
did
endow
that
he
replied
is
palpably
absurd
you
mean
you
did
not
mean
to
keep
your
word
o
yes
he
answered
in
a
general
way
and
that
said
she
is
how
i
meant
obey
if
they
meant
all
they
said
charm
is
a
woman
strongest
arm
my
charwoman
is
full
of
charm
i
chose
her
not
for
strength
of
arm
but
for
her
strange
elusive
charm
and
how
tears
heighten
woman
powers
my
typist
weeps
for
hours
and
hours
i
took
her
for
her
weeping
powers
they
so
delight
my
business
hours
a
woman
lives
by
intuition
though
my
accountant
shuns
addition
she
has
the
rarest
intuition
and
i
myself
can
do
addition
timidity
in

is

a

my

is
any
woman
now
who
cares
to
think
about

as

do
think
she
oughter
the
warning
no
it
is
home
neglecting
if
you
spend
your

selecting
seven

a

and
a

or
to

to
paying
needless

that

to
spend

at

oh
my

all

said
jones
in

subject
yourselves
to

heard
him
quote
they
rule
the
world
without
the
vote
by
he
would
submit
when
all
the
women
wanted
it
by
looking
glum
he
said
that
it
was
bound
to
come
this
year
i
heard
him
say
with
pride
no
reasons
on
the
other
side
by
he
insist
he
always
been
a
suffragist
and
what
is
really
stranger
too
he
think
that
what
he
says
is
true
intercepted
only
the
worst
of
them
vote
are
not
the
suffragists
frights
nietzsche
the

sex
is

i

no
we
do

we

is
their
only
appeal
woman

no
we
do
think
but
we
feel
does
it
rub
off
the

woman

at

is
the
speaker
a
bore
does
it
rub
off
the

oh
it
a
fad
nothing
more
is
the

a
bore
nietzsche
the
person
to
quote
oh
it
a
fad
nothing
more
only
the
worst
of

the
universal

oh
there
you
go
again
invading
man
domain
it
nature
laws
you
know
you
are
defying
do
fancy
that
you
can
be
really
like
a
man
so
what
the
use
of
all
this
fuss
and
trying
it
seems
to
me
so
clear
that
women
highest
sphere
is
being
loving
wives
and
patient
mothers
oh
ca
you
be
content
to
be
as
you
were

she
stood
up
causing
him
some
alarm
you
going
to
tell
me
i
lose
my
charm
and
what
is
a
woman
when
charm
has
fled
and
you
going
to

that
you
greatly
fear

do
understand
a

are
you

said
you
going
to
ask
what
i
hope
to
gain
by
stepping
down
to
the
dusty
plain
by
seeking
a
stone
when
i
might
have
bread
you
going
to
say
a
vote
replace
the
tender
force
of
a
woman
grace
now
are
you
honestly
yes
he
said
i
know
what
you
going
to
do
he
said
you
going
to
talk
to
me
all
day
long
trying
to
make
me
see
i
wrong
and
other
men
who
are
less
misled
will
pale
with
jealousy
when
they
see
the
time
you
give
to
converting
me
now
are
you
honestly
she
said
what
every
woman
must
not
say
i
do
pretend
i
clever
he
remarked
or
very
wise
and
at
this
she
murmured
really
with
the
right
polite
surprise
but
women
he
continued
i
must
own
i
understand
women
are
a
contradiction
honorable
and
underhand
constant
as
the
star
polaris
yet
as
changeable
as
fate
always
flying
what
they
long
for
always
seeking
what
they
hate
do
you
think
began
the
lady
but
he
cut
her
short
i
see
that
you
take
it
personally
women
always
do
said
he
you
will
pardon
me
for
saying
every
woman
is
the
same
always
greedy
for
approval
always
sensitive
to
blame
sweet
and
passionate
are
women
weak
in
mind
though
strong
in
soul
even
you
admit
i
fancy
that
they
have
no
no
i
do
admit
they
have
said
the
patient
lady
then
or
they
could
not
sit
and
listen
to
the
nonsense
talked
by
men
chivalry
it
treating
a
woman
politely
as
long
as
she
is
a
fright
it
guarding
the
girls
who
act
rightly
if
you
can
be
judge
of
what
right
it
being
not
just
but
so
pleasant
it
tipping
while
wages
are
low
it
making
a
beautiful
present
and
failing
to
pay
what
you
owe
our
own
nursery
chivalry
chivalry
where
have
you
been
i
been
out
seeking
a
beautiful
queen
chivalry
chivalry
what
did
you
find
commonplace
women
not
much
to
my
mind
women
rather
insincere
apologies
to
rudyard
i
went
to
ask
my
government
if
they
would
set
me
free
they
gave
a
pardoned
crook
a
vote
but
had
one
for
me
the
men
about
me
laughed
and
frowned
and
said
go
home
because
we
really
ca
be
bothered
when
we
busy
making
laws
oh
it
women
this
and
women
that
and
women
have
no
sense
but
it
pay
your
taxes
promptly
when
it
comes
to
the
expense
it
comes
to
the
expense
my
dears
it
comes
to
the
expense
it
pay
your
taxes
promptly
when
it
comes
to
the
expense
i
went
into
a
factory
to
earn
my
daily
bread
men
said
the
home
is
woman
sphere
i
have
no
home
i
said
but
when
the
men
all
marched
to
war
they
cried
to
wife
and
maid
oh
never
mind
about
the
home
but
save
the
export
trade
for
it
women
this
and
women
that
and
home
the
place
for
you
but
it
patriotic
angels
when
there
outside
work
to
do
there
outside
work
to
do
my
dears
there
outside
work
to
do
it
patriotic
angels
when
there
outside
work
to
do
we
are
not
really
senseless
and
we
are
not
angels
too
but
very
human
beings
human
just
as
much
as
you
it
hard
upon
occasions
to
be
forceful
and
sublime
when
you
treated
as
incompetents
of
the
time
but
it
women
this
and
women
that
and
woman
like
a
hen
but
it
do
the
country
work
alone
when
war
takes
off
the
men
and
it
women
this
and
women
that
and
everything
you
please
but
woman
is
observant
and
be
sure
that
woman
sees
beware
in
the
days
that
are
gone
when
a
statue
was
wanted
in
park
or
museum
where
statues
must
be
a
chivalrous
male
would
come
forward
undaunted
and
say
if
you
must
have
one
make
it
of
me
bad
though
they
be
yet
i
agree
if
you
must
make
them
why
make
them
of
me
but
chivalry
dead
as
i
always
expected
since
women
would
not
let
things
stay
as
they
were
so
now
i
suppose
when
a
statue
erected
men
will
say
brutally
make
it
of
her
she
may
prefer
things
as
they
were
when
they
start
making
the
statues
of
her
male
philosophy
men
are
very
brave
you
know
that
was
settled
long
ago
ask
however
if
you
doubt
it
any
man
you
meet
about
it
he
will
say
i
think
like
me
men
are
brave
as
they
can
be
women
think
they
brave
you
say
do
they
really
well
they
may
but
such
biased
attestation
is
not
worth
consideration
for
a
legal
judgment
shelves
what
they
say
about
themselves
from
a
man
point
of
view
women
love
suffering
and
good
advice
if
they
do
love
these
sincerely
then
they
not
true
women
really
oh
it
shocks
me
so
to
note
women
pleading
for
the
vote
saying
publicly
it
would
educate
and
do
them
good
such
a
selfish
reason
trips
oddly
from
a
woman
lips
but
it
must
not
be
supposed
i
am
in
the
least
opposed
if
they
want
it
let
them
try
it
for
i
think
we
profit
by
it
glory
i
went
to
see
old
susan
gray
whose
soldier
sons
had
marched
away
and
this
is
what
she
had
to
say
it
is
war
i
hate
at
all
is
likely
men
must
fight
but
oh
these
flags
and
uniforms
it
them
that
is
right
if
war
must
come
and
come
it
does
to
take
our
boys
from
play
it
is
right
to
make
it
seem
so
beautiful
and
gay
i
left
old
susan
with
a
sigh
a
famous
band
was
marching
by
to
make
men
glad
they
had
to
die
dependence
an
englishwoman
whose
income
has
stopped
owing
to
her
two
sons
having
joined
the
english
army
was
taken
care
of
last
night
at
the
florence
crittenden
the
young
men
said
to
their
mother
hear
us
o
dearest
and
best
time
can
not
cool
or
smother
the
love
of
you
in
our
breast
here
is
your
place
and
no
other
come
home
and
rest
and
the
mother
heart
was
grateful
for
the
love
of
her
cherished
ones
and
her
labor
bitter
and
hateful
she
left
at
the
word
of
her
sons
till
she
heard
far
off
the
fateful
voices
of
guns
their
love
did
more
enslave
her
they
did
not
understand
that
none
could
guard
or
save
her
when
war
was
on
the
land
but
herself
and
god
who
gave
her
heart
and
mind
and
hand
playthings
last
year
the
shops
were
crowded
with
soldier
suits
and
guns
the
presents
that
at
christmas
time
we
give
our
little
sons
and
many
a
glittering
trumpet
and
many
a
sword
and
drum
but
as
they
made
in
germany
this
year
they
will
not
come
perhaps
another
season
we
shall
not
give
our
boys
such
very
warlike
playthings
such
military
toys
perhaps
another
season
we
shall
not
think
it
sweet
to
watch
their
game
of
soldier
men
who
dream
not
of
defeat
militants
hippolta
penthesilea
maria
teresa
and
joan
agustina
and
boadicea
and
some
militant
girls
of
our
own
it
would
take
a
brave
man
and
a
dull
one
to
say
to
these
ladies
of
course
we
adore
you
while
meek
timid
clinging
and
weak
but
a
woman
can
never
use
force
a
lady
choice
her
old
love
in
tears
and
silence
had
been
building
her
a
palace
ringed
by
moats
and
flanked
with
towers
he
had
set
it
on
a
hill
here
he
said
will
come
no
whisper
of
the
world
alarms
and
malice
in
these
granite
walls
imprisoned
i
will
keep
you
safe
from
as
he
spoke
along
the
highway
there
came
riding
by
a
stranger
for
an
instant
on
her
features
he
a
fleeting
glance
bestowed
then
he
said
my
heart
is
fickle
and
the
world
is
full
of
danger
and
he
offered
her
his
stirrup
and
he
pointed
down
the
road
the
ballad
of
lost
causes
years
after
tell
me
in
what
spot
remote
do
the
antis
dwell
those
who
did
not
want
to
vote
feared
their
sex
prompt
decay
where
are
those
who
used
to
say
home
alone
is
woman
sphere
only
those
should
vote
who
slay
where
the
snows
of
where
are
those
who
used
to
quote
nietzsche
words
in
dread
array
where
the
ancient
crones
who
wrote
women
rule
through
beauty
sway
and
those
lovers
where
are
they
who
could
hold
no
woman
dear
if
she
had
the
ballot
nay
where
the
snows
of
prince
inquire
no
more
i
pray
whither
antis
disappear
suffrage
won
they
melt
away
like
the
snows
of
thoughts
at
an
anti
meeting
there
are
no
homes
in
suffrage
states
there
are
no
children
glad
and
good
there
men
no
longer
seek
for
mates
and
women
lose
their
womanhood
this
i
believe
without
debate
and
yet
i
ask
and
ask
in
vain
why
no
one
in
a
suffrage
state
has
moved
to
change
things
back
again
a
masque
of
teachers
and
the
unconscious
suffragists
the
ideal
candidates
a
of
the
new
york
board
of
education
says
no
married
woman
shall
be
appointed
to
any
teaching
or
supervising
position
in
the
new
york
public
schools
unless
her
husband
is
mentally
or
physically
incapacitated
to
earn
a
living
or
has
deserted
her
for
a
period
of
not
less
than
one
year
characters
of
by
now
please
do
waste
your
time
and
ours
by
pleas
all
based
on
mental
powers
she
seems
to
us
the
proper
stuff
who
has
a
band
bad
enough
all
other
pleas
appear
to
us
excessively
superfluous
my
husband
is
not
really
bad
how
very
sad
how
very
sad
he
good
but
hear
my
one
excuse
oh
what
the
use
oh
what
the
use
last
winter
in
a
railroad
wreck
he
lost
an
arm
and
broke
his
neck
he
doomed
but
lingers
day
by
day
her
husband
doomed
hurray
hurray
my
husband
kind
and
healthy
too
why
then
of
course
you
will
not
do
just
hear
me
out
you
find
you
wrong
it
true
his
body
good
and
strong
but
ah
his
wits
are
all
astray
her
husband
mad
hip
hip
hurray
my
husband
wise
and
well
the
creature
then
you
can
never
be
a
teacher
wait
for
i
led
him
such
a
life
he
could
not
stand
me
as
a
wife
last
michaelmas
he
ran
away
her
husband
hates
her
hip
hurray
by
now
we
have
found
without
a
doubt
by
process
sound
and
well
thought
out
each
candidate
is
fit
in
truth
to
educate
the
mind
of
youth
no
teacher
need
apply
to
us
whose
married
life
harmonious
the
unconscious
suffragists
they
who
have
no
voice
nor
vote
in
the
electing
of
representatives
do
not
enjoy
liberty
but
are
absolutely
enslaved
to
those
who
have
votes
benjamin
franklin
no
such
phrase
as
virtual
representation
was
ever
known
in
law
or
constitution
james
otis
but
these
great
cities
says
my
honorable
friend
are
virtually
though
not
directly
represented
are
not
the
wishes
of
manchester
he
asks
as
much
consulted
as
those
of
any
other
town
which
sends
members
to
parliament
now
sir
i
do
not
understand
how
a
power
which
is
salutary
when
exercised
virtually
can
be
noxious
when
exercised
directly
if
the
wishes
of
manchester
have
as
much
weight
with
us
as
they
would
have
under
a
system
which
gives
representatives
to
manchester
how
can
there
be
any
danger
in
giving

democracy

a

for

we
believe
that
this

is
best
accomplished
by

in

is
apt
to
secure

for

when
they
spoke

were
thinking

they
were
