by

to
alice
drysdale
vickery
whose
prophetic
vision
of
liberated
womanhood
has
been
an
inspiration
i
dream
of
a
world
in
which
the
spirits
of
women
are
flames
stronger
than
fire
a
world
in
which
modesty
has
become
courage
and
yet
remains
modesty
a
world
in
which
women
are
as
unlike
men
as
ever
they
were
in
the
world
i
sought
to
destroy
a
world
in
which
women
shine
with
a
loveliness
of
as
enchanting
as
ever
the
old
legends
told
and
yet
a
world
which
would
immeasurably
transcend
the
old
world
in
the
passion
of
human
service
i
have
dreamed
of
that
world

birth
control
sanger
claims
and
claims
rightly
to
be
a
question
of
fundamental
importance
at
the
present
time
i
do
not
know
how
far
one
is
justified
in
calling
it
the
pivot
or
the
of
a
progressive
civilization
these
terms
involve
a
criticism
of
metaphors
that
may
take
us
far
away
from
the
question
in
hand
birth
control
is
no
new
thing
in
human
experience
and
it
has
been
practised
in
societies
of
the
most
various
types
and
fortunes
but
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
at
the
present
time
it
is
a
test
issue
between
two
widely
different
interpretations
of
the
word
civilization
and
of
what
is
good
in
life
and
conduct
the
way
in
which
men
and
women
range
themselves
in
this
controversy
is
more
simply
and
directly
indicative
of
their
general
intellectual
quality
than
any
other
single
indication
i
do
not
wish
to
imply
by
this
that
the
people
who
oppose
are
more
or
less
intellectual
than
the
people
who
advocate
birth
control
but
only
that
they
have
fundamentally
contrasted
general
ideas
that
mentally
they
are
different
very
simple
very
complex
very
dull
and
very
brilliant
persons
may
be
found
in
either
camp
but
all
those
in
either
camp
have
certain
attitudes
in
common
which
they
share
with
one
another
and
do
not
share
with
those
in
the
other
camp
there
have
been
many
definitions
of
civilization
civilization
is
a
complexity
of
countless
aspects
and
may
be
validly
defined
in
a
great
number
of
relationships
a
reader
of
james
harvey
robinson
mind
in
the
making
will
find
it
very
reasonable
to
define
a
civilization
as
a
system
of
ideas
at
issue
with
reality
just
so
far
as
the
system
of
ideas
meets
the
needs
and
conditions
of
survival
or
is
able
to
adapt
itself
to
the
needs
and
conditions
of
survival
of
the
society
it
dominates
so
far
will
that
society
continue
and
prosper
we
are
beginning
to
realize
that
in
the
past
and
under
different
conditions
from
our
own
societies
have
existed
with
systems
of
ideas
and
with
methods
of
thought
very
widely
contrasting
with
what
we
should
consider
right
and
sane
the
extraordinary
neolithic
civilizations
of
the
american
continent
that
flourished
before
the
coming
of
the
europeans
seem
to
have
got
along
with
concepts
that
involved
pedantries
and
cruelties
and
a
kind
of
systematic
unreason
which
find
their
closest
parallels
in
the
art
and
writings
of
certain
types
of
lunatic
there
are
collections
of
drawings
from
english
and
american
asylums
extraordinarily
parallel
in
their
spirit
and
quality
with
the
maya
inscriptions
of
central
america
yet
these
neolithic
american
societies
got
along
for
hundreds
and
perhaps
thousands
of
years
they
respected
and
harvest
they
bred
and
they
maintained
a
grotesque
and
terrible
order
and
they
produced
quite
beautiful
works
of
art
yet
their
surplus
of
population
was
disposed
of
by
an
organization
of
sacrificial
slaughter
unparalleled
in
the
records
of
mankind
many
of
the
institutions
that
seemed
most
normal
and
respectable
to
them
filled
the
invading
europeans
with
perplexity
and
horror
when
we
realize
clearly
this
possibility
of
civilizations
being
based
on
very
different
sets
of
moral
ideas
and
upon
different
intellectual
methods
we
are
better
able
to
appreciate
the
profound
significance
of
the
schism
in
our
modern
community
which
gives
us
side
by
side
honest
and
intelligent
people
who
regard
birth
control
as
something
essentially
sweet
sane
clean
desirable
and
necessary
and
others
equally
honest
and
with
as
good
a
claim
to
intelligence
who
regard
it
as
not
merely
unreasonable
and
unwholesome
but
as
intolerable
and
abominable
we
are
living
not
in
a
simple
and
complete
civilization
but
in
a
conflict
of
at
least
two
civilizations
based
on
entirely
different
fundamental
ideas
pursuing
different
methods
and
with
different
aims
and
ends
i
will
call
one
of
these
civilizations
our
traditional
or
authoritative
civilization
it
rests
upon
the
thing
that
is
and
upon
the
thing
that
has
been
it
insists
upon
respect
for
custom
and
usage
it
discourages
criticism
and
enquiry
it
is
very
ancient
and
conservative
or
going
beyond
conservation
it
is
reactionary
the
vehement
hostility
of
many
catholic
priests
and
prelates
towards
new
views
of
human
origins
and
new
views
of
moral
questions
has
led
many
careless
thinkers
to
identify
this
old
traditional
civilization
with
christianity
but
that
identification
ignores
the
strongly
revolutionary
and
initiatory
spirit
that
has
always
animated
christianity
and
is
untrue
even
to
the
realities
of
orthodox
catholic
teaching
the
vituperation
of
individual
catholics
must
not
be
confused
with
the
deliberate
doctrines
of
the
church
which
have
on
the
whole
been
conspicuously
cautious
and
balanced
and
sane
in
these
matters
the
ideas
and
practices
of
the
old
civilization
are
older
and
more
widespread
than
and
not
identifiable
with
either
christian
or
catholic
culture
and
it
will
be
a
great
misfortune
if
the
issues
between
the
old
civilization
and
the
new
are
allowed
to
slip
into
the
deep
ruts
of
religious
controversies
that
are
only
accidentally
and
intermittently
parallel
contrasted
with
the
ancient
civilization
with
the
traditional
disposition
which
accepts
institutions
and
moral
values
as
though
they
were
a
part
of
nature
we
have
what
i
may
call
with
an
evident
bias
in
its
favour
the
civilization
of
enquiry
of
experimental
knowledge
creative
and
progressive
civilization
the
first
great
outbreak
of
the
spirit
of
this
civilization
was
in
republican
greece
the
martyrdom
of
socrates
the
fearless
utopianism
of
plato
the
ambitious
encyclopaedism
of
aristotle
mark
the
dawn
of
a
new
courage
and
a
new
wilfulness
in
human
affairs
the
fear
of
set
limitations
of
punitive
and
restrictive
laws
imposed
by
fate
upon
human
life
was
visibly
fading
in
human
minds
these
names
mark
the
first
clear
realization
that
to
a
large
extent
and
possibly
to
an
illimitable
extent
man
moral
and
social
life
and
his
general
destiny
could
be
seized
upon
and
controlled
by
man
but
he
must
have
knowledge
said
the
ancient
civilization
and
it
says
it
still
through
a
multitude
of
vigorous
voices
and
harsh
repressive
acts
let
man
learn
his
duty
and
obey
says
the
new
civilization
with
confidence
let
man
know
and
trust
him
for
long
ages
the
old
civilization
kept
the
new
subordinate
apologetic
and
ineffective
but
for
the
last
two
centuries
the
new
has
fought
its
way
to
a
position
of
contentious
equality
the
two
go
on
side
by
side
jostling
upon
a
thousand
issues
the
world
changes
the
conditions
of
life
change
rapidly
through
that
development
of
organized
science
which
is
the
natural
method
of
the
new
civilization
the
old
tradition
demands
that
national
loyalties
and
ancient
belligerence
should
continue
the
new
has
produced
means
of
communication
that
break
down
the
pens
and
separations
of
human
life
upon
which
nationalist
emotion
depends
the
old
tradition
insists
upon
its
ancient
of
war
the
new
knowledge
carries
that
war
to
undreamt
of
levels
of
destruction
the
ancient
system
needed
an
unrestricted
breeding
to
meet
the
normal
waste
of
life
through
war
pestilence
and
a
multitude
of
hitherto
unpreventable
diseases
the
new
knowledge
sweeps
away
the
venerable
checks
of
pestilence
and
disease
and
confronts
us
with
the
congestions
and
explosive
dangers
of
an
world
the
old
tradition
demands
a
special
prolific
class
doomed
to
labor
and
subservience
the
new
points
to
mechanism
and
to
scientific
organization
as
a
means
of
escape
from
this
immemorial
subjugation
upon
every
main
issue
in
life
there
is
this
quarrel
between
the
method
of
submission
and
the
method
of
knowledge
more
and
more
do
men
of
science
and
intelligent
people
generally
realize
the
hopelessness
of
pouring
new
wine
into
old
bottles
more
and
more
clearly
do
they
grasp
the
significance
of
the
great
teacher
parable
the
new
civilization
is
saying
to
the
old
now
we
can
not
go
on
making
power
for
you
to
spend
upon
international
conflict
you
must
stop
waving
flags
and
bandying
insults
you
must
organize
the
peace
of
the
world
you
must
subdue
yourselves
to
the
federation
of
all
mankind
and
we
can
not
go
on
giving
you
health
freedom
enlargement
limitless
wealth
if
all
our
gifts
to
you
are
to
be
swamped
by
an
indiscriminate
torrent
of
progeny
we
want
fewer
and
better
children
who
can
be
reared
up
to
their
full
possibilities
in
unencumbered
homes
and
we
can
not
make
the
social
life
and
the
we
are
determined
to
make
with
the
swarms
of
inferior
citizens
that
you
inflict
upon
us
and
there
at
the
passionate
and
crucial
question
this
essential
and
fundamental
question
whether
procreation
is
still
to
be
a
superstitious
and
often
disastrous
mystery
undertaken
in
fear
and
ignorance
reluctantly
and
under
the
sway
of
blind
desires
or
whether
it
is
to
become
a
deliberate
creative
act
the
two
civilizations
join
issue
now
it
is
a
conflict
from
which
it
is
almost
impossible
to
abstain
our
acts
our
way
of
living
our
social
tolerance
our
very
silences
will
count
in
this
crucial
decision
between
the
old
and
the
new
in
a
plain
and
lucid
style
without
any
emotional
appeals
margaret
sanger
sets
out
the
case
of
the
new
order
against
the
old
there
have
been
several
able
books
published
recently
upon
the
question
of
birth
control
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
woman
personal
life
and
from
the
point
of
view
of
married
happiness
but
i
do
not
think
there
has
been
any
book
as
yet
popularly
accessible
which
presents
this
matter
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
public
good
and
as
a
necessary
step
to
the
further
improvement
of
human
life
as
a
whole
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
there
has
hitherto
been
rather
too
much
personal
emotion
spent
upon
this
business
and
far
too
little
attention
given
to
its
broader
aspects
sanger
with
her
extraordinary
breadth
of
outlook
and
the
real
scientific
quality
of
her
mind
has
now
redressed
the
balance
she
has
lifted
this
question
from
out
of
the
warm
atmosphere
of
troubled
domesticity
in
which
it
has
hitherto
been
discussed
to
its
proper
level
of
a
predominantly
important
human
affair

walt
whitman
this
book
aims
to
be
neither
the
first
word
on
the
tangled
problems
of
human
society
nor
the
last
my
aim
has
been
to
emphasize
by
the
use
of
concrete
and
challenging
examples
and
neglected
facts
the
need
of
a
new
approach
to
individual
and
social
problems
its
central
challenge
is
that
civilization
in
any
true
sense
of
the
word
is
based
upon
the
control
and
guidance
of
the
great
natural
instinct
of
sex
mastery
of
this
force
is
possible
only
through
the
instrument
of
birth
control
it
may
be
objected
that
in
the
following
pages
i
have
rushed
in
where
academic
scholars
have
feared
to
tread
and
that
as
an
active
propagandist
i
am
lacking
in
the
scholarship
and
documentary
preparation
to
undertake
such
a
stupendous
task
my
only
defense
is
that
from
my
point
of
view
at
least
too
many
are
already
studying
and
investigating
social
problems
from
without
with
a
sort
of
olympian
detachment
and
on
the
other
hand
too
few
of
those
who
are
engaged
in
this
endless
war
for
human
betterment
have
found
the
time
to
give
to
the
world
those
truths
not
always
hidden
but
practically
unquarried
which
may
be
secured
only
after
years
of
active
service
of
late
we
have
been
treated
to
accounts
written
by
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
have
assumed
clever
disguises
and
have
gone
out
to
work
for
a
week
or
a
month
among
the
proletariat
but
can
we
thus
learn
anything
new
of
the
fundamental
problems
of
working
men
working
women
working
children
something
perhaps
but
not
those
great
central
problems
of
hunger
and
sex
we
have
been
told
that
only
those
who
themselves
have
suffered
the
pangs
of
starvation
can
truly
understand
hunger
you
might
come
into
the
closest
contact
with
a
starving
man
yet
if
you
were
yourself
no
amount
of
sympathy
could
give
you
actual
insight
into
the
psychology
of
his
suffering
this
suggests
an
objective
and
a
subjective
approach
to
all
social
problems
whatever
the
weakness
of
the
subjective
or
if
you
prefer
the
feminine
approach
it
has
at
least
the
virtue
that
its
conclusions
are
tested
by
experience
observation
of
facts
about
you
intimate
subjective
reaction
to
such
facts
generate
in
your
mind
certain
fundamental
convictions
truths
you
can
ignore
no
more
than
you
can
ignore
such
truths
as
come
as
the
fruit
of
bitter
but
valuable
personal
experience
regarding
myself
i
may
say
that
my
experience
in
the
course
of
the
past
twelve
or
fifteen
years
has
been
of
a
type
to
force
upon
me
certain
convictions
that
demand
expression
for
years
i
had
believed
that
the
solution
of
all
our
troubles
was
to
be
found
in
programmes
of
political
and
legislative
action
at
first
i
concentrated
my
whole
attention
upon
these
only
to
discover
that
politicians
and
are
just
as
confused
and
as
much
at
a
loss
in
solving
fundamental
problems
as
anyone
else
and
i
am
speaking
here
not
so
much
of
the
corrupt
and
ignorant
politician
as
of
those
idealists
and
reformers
who
think
that
by
the
ballot
society
may
be
led
to
an
earthly
paradise
they
may
honestly
desire
and
intend
to
do
great
things
they
may
positively
glow
before
election
with
enthusiasm
at
the
prospect
they
imagine
political
victory
may
open
to
them
time
after
time
i
was
struck
by
the
change
in
their
attitude
after
the
briefest
enjoyment
of
this
illusory
power
men
are
elected
during
some
wave
of
reform
let
us
say
elected
to
legislate
into
practical
working
existence
some
great
ideal
they
want
to
do
big
things
but
a
short
time
in
office
is
enough
to
show
the
political
idealist
that
he
can
accomplish
nothing
that
his
reform
must
be
debased
and
dragged
into
the
dust
so
that
even
if
it
becomes
enacted
it
may
be
not
merely
of
no
benefit
but
a
positive
evil
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
emphasize
this
point
it
is
an
accepted
commonplace
of
american
politics
so
much
of
life
so
large
a
part
of
all
our
social
problems
moreover
remains
untouched
by
political
and
legislative
action
this
is
an
old
truth
too
often
ignored
by
those
who
plan
political
campaigns
upon
the
most
superficial
knowledge
of
human
nature
my
own
eyes
were
opened
to
the
limitations
of
political
action
when
as
an
organizer
for
a
political
group
in
new
york
i
attended
by
chance
a
meeting
of
women
who
were
on
strike
we
believed
we
could
help
these
women
with
a
legislative
measure
and
asked
their
support
oh
that
stuff
exclaimed
one
of
these
women
do
you
know
that
we
women
might
be
dead
and
buried
if
we
waited
for
politicians
and
lawmakers
to
right
our
wrongs
this
set
me
to
thinking
not
merely
of
the
immediate
problem
but
to
asking
myself
how
much
any
male
politician
could
understand
of
the
wrongs
inflicted
upon
poor
working
women
i
threw
the
weight
of
my
study
and
activity
into
the
economic
and
industrial
struggle
here
i
discovered
men
and
women
fired
with
the
glorious
vision
of
a
new
world
of
a
proletarian
world
emancipated
a
utopian
world
it
glowed
in
romantic
colours
for
the
majority
of
those
with
whom
i
came
in
closest
contact
the
next
step
the
immediate
step
was
another
matter
less
romantic
and
too
often
less
encouraging
in
their
ardor
some
of
the
labor
leaders
of
that
period
almost
convinced
us
that
the
millennium
was
just
around
the
corner
those
were
the
days
of
dramatic
strikes
but
even
when
most
under
the
spell
of
the
new
vision
the
sight
of
the
overburdened
wives
of
the
strikers
with
their
puny
babies
and
their
broods
of
children
made
us
stop
and
think
of
a
neglected
factor
in
the
march
toward
our
earthly
paradise
it
was
well
enough
to
ask
the
poor
men
workers
to
carry
on
the
battle
against
economic
injustice
but
what
results
could
be
expected
when
they
were
forced
in
addition
to
carry
the
burden
of
their
families
this
question
loomed
large
to
those
of
us
who
came
into
intimate
contact
with
the
women
and
children
we
saw
that
in
the
final
analysis
the
real
burden
of
economic
and
industrial
warfare
was
thrust
upon
the
frail
shoulders
of
the
children
the
very
babies
the
coming
generation
in
their
wan
faces
in
their
undernourished
bodies
would
be
indelibly
written
the
bitter
defeat
of
their
parents
the
eloquence
of
those
who
led
the
underpaid
and
workers
could
no
longer
for
me
at
least
ring
with
conviction
something
more
than
the
purely
economic
interpretation
was
involved
the
bitter
struggle
for
bread
for
a
home
and
material
comfort
was
but
one
phase
of
the
problem
there
was
another
phase
perhaps
even
more
fundamental
that
had
been
absolutely
neglected
by
the
adherents
of
the
new
dogmas
that
other
phase
was
the
driving
power
of
instinct
a
power
uncontrolled
and
unnoticed
the
great
fundamental
instinct
of
sex
was
expressing
itself
in
these
broods
in
the
prosperity
of
the
slum
midwife
and
her
colleague
the
slum
undertaker
in
spite
of
all
my
sympathy
with
the
dream
of
liberated
labor
i
was
driven
to
ask
whether
this
urging
power
of
sex
this
deep
instinct
was
not
at
least
partially
responsible
along
with
industrial
injustice
for
the
widespread
misery
of
the
world
to
find
an
answer
to
this
problem
which
at
that
point
in
my
experience
i
could
not
solve
i
determined
to
study
conditions
in
europe
perhaps
there
i
might
discover
a
new
approach
a
great
illumination
just
before
the
outbreak
of
the
war
i
visited
france
spain
germany
and
great
britain
everywhere
i
found
the
same
dogmas
and
prejudices
among
labor
leaders
the
same
intense
but
limited
vision
the
same
insistence
upon
the
purely
economic
phases
of
human
nature
the
same
belief
that
if
the
problem
of
hunger
were
solved
the
question
of
the
women
and
children
would
take
care
of
itself
in
this
attitude
i
discovered
then
what
seemed
to
me
to
be
purely
masculine
reasoning
and
because
it
was
purely
masculine
it
could
at
best
be
but
half
true
feminine
insight
must
be
brought
to
bear
on
all
questions
and
here
it
struck
me
the
fallacy
of
the
masculine
the
was
brutally
exposed
i
was
encouraged
and
strengthened
in
this
attitude
by
the
support
of
certain
leaders
who
had
studied
human
nature
and
who
had
reached
the
same
conclusion
that
civilization
could
not
solve
the
problem
of
hunger
until
it
recognized
the
titanic
strength
of
the
sexual
instinct
in
spain
i
found
that
lorenzo
portet
who
was
carrying
on
the
work
of
the
martyred
francisco
ferrer
had
reached
this
same
conclusion
in
italy
enrico
malatesta
the
valiant
leader
who
was
after
the
war
to
play
so
dramatic
a
role
was
likewise
combating
the
current
dogma
of
the
orthodox
socialists
in
berlin
rudolph
rocker
was
engaged
in
the
thankless
task
of
puncturing
the
articles
of
faith
of
the
orthodox
marxian
religion
it
is
quite
needless
to
add
that
these
men
who
had
probed
beneath
the
surface
of
the
problem
and
had
diagnosed
so
much
more
completely
the
complex
malady
of
contemporary
society
were
intensely
disliked
by
the
superficial
theorists
of
the
school
the
gospel
of
marx
had
however
been
too
long
and
too
thoroughly
inculcated
into
the
minds
of
millions
of
workers
in
europe
to
be
discarded
it
is
a
flattering
doctrine
since
it
teaches
the
laborer
that
all
the
fault
is
with
someone
else
that
he
is
the
victim
of
circumstances
and
not
even
a
partner
in
the
creation
of
his
own
and
his
child
misery
not
without
significance
was
the
additional
discovery
that
i
made
i
found
that
the
marxian
influence
tended
to
lead
workers
to
believe
that
irrespective
of
the
health
of
the
poor
mothers
the
earning
capacity
of
the
fathers
or
the
upbringing
of
the
children
increase
of
the
proletarian
family
was
a
benefit
not
a
detriment
to
the
revolutionary
movement
the
greater
the
number
of
hungry
mouths
the
emptier
the
stomachs
the
more
quickly
would
the
class
war
be
precipitated
the
greater
the
increase
in
population
among
the
proletariat
the
greater
the
incentive
to
revolution
this
may
not
be
sound
marxian
theory
but
it
is
the
manner
in
which
it
is
popularly
accepted
it
is
the
popular
belief
wherever
the
marxian
influence
is
strong
this
i
found
especially
in
england
and
scotland
in
speaking
to
groups
of
dockworkers
on
strike
in
glasgow
and
before
the
communist
and
guilds
throughout
england
i
discovered
a
prevailing
opposition
to
the
recognition
of
sex
as
a
factor
in
the
perpetuation
of
poverty
the
leaders
and
theorists
were
immovable
in
their
opposition
but
when
once
i
succeeded
in
breaking
through
the
surface
opposition
of
the
rank
and
file
of
the
workers
i
found
that
they
were
willing
to
recognize
the
power
of
this
neglected
factor
in
their
lives
so
central
so
fundamental
in
the
life
of
every
man
and
woman
is
this
problem
that
they
need
be
taught
no
elaborate
or
imposing
theory
to
explain
their
troubles
to
approach
their
problems
by
the
avenue
of
sex
and
reproduction
is
to
reveal
at
once
their
fundamental
relations
to
the
whole
economic
and
biological
structure
of
society
their
interest
is
immediately
and
completely
awakened
but
always
as
i
soon
discovered
the
ideas
and
habits
of
thought
of
these
submerged
masses
have
been
formed
through
the
press
the
church
through
political
institutions
all
of
which
had
built
up
a
conspiracy
of
silence
around
a
subject
that
is
of
no
less
vital
importance
than
that
of
hunger
a
great
wall
separates
the
masses
from
those
imperative
truths
that
must
be
known
and
flung
wide
if
civilization
is
to
be
saved
as
currently
constituted
church
press
education
seem
organized
to
exploit
the
ignorance
and
the
prejudices
of
the
masses
rather
than
to
light
their
way
to
such
was
the
situation
in
when
i
returned
to
america
determined
since
the
exclusively
masculine
point
of
view
had
dominated
too
long
that
the
other
half
of
the
truth
should
be
made
known
the
birth
control
movement
was
launched
because
it
was
in
this
form
that
the
whole
relation
of
woman
and
child
eternal
emblem
of
the
future
of
society
could
be
more
effectively
dramatized
the
amazing
growth
of
this
movement
dates
from
the
moment
when
in
my
home
a
small
group
organized
the
first
birth
control
league
since
then
we
have
been
criticized
for
our
choice
of
the
term
birth
control
to
express
the
idea
of
modern
scientific
contraception
i
have
yet
to
hear
any
criticism
of
this
term
that
is
not
based
upon
some
false
and
hypocritical
sense
of
modesty
or
that
does
not
arise
out
of
a
misunderstanding
of
its
aim
on
the
other
hand
nothing
better
expresses
the
idea
of
purposive
responsible
and
guidance
of
the
reproductive
powers
those
critics
who
condemn
birth
control
as
a
negative
destructive
idea
concerned
only
with
might
profitably
open
the
nearest
dictionary
for
a
definition
of
control
there
they
would
discover
that
the
verb
control
means
to
exercise
a
directing
guiding
or
restraining
influence
to
direct
to
regulate
to
counteract
control
is
guidance
direction
foresight
it
implies
intelligence
forethought
and
responsibility
they
will
find
in
the
standard
dictionary
a
quotation
from
lecky
to
the
effect
that
the
greatest
of
all
evils
in
politics
is
power
without
control
in
what
phase
of
life
is
not
power
without
control
an
evil
birth
control
therefore
means
not
merely
the
limitation
of
births
but
the
application
of
intelligent
guidance
over
the
reproductive
power
it
means
the
substitution
of
reason
and
intelligence
for
the
blind
play
of
instinct
the
term
birth
control
had
the
immense
practical
advantage
of
compressing
into
two
short
words
the
answer
to
the
inarticulate
demands
of
millions
of
men
and
women
in
all
countries
at
the
time
this
slogan
was
formulated
i
had
not
yet
come
to
the
complete
realization
of
the
great
truth
that
had
been
thus
crystallized
it
was
the
response
to
the
overwhelming
appeals
that
came
by
every
mail
for
aid
and
advice
which
revealed
a
great
truth
that
lay
dormant
a
truth
that
seemed
to
spring
into
full
vitality
almost
over
night
that
could
never
again
be
crushed
to
earth
nor
could
i
then
have
realized
the
number
and
the
power
of
the
enemies
who
were
to
be
aroused
into
activity
by
this
idea
so
completely
was
i
dominated
by
this
conviction
of
the
efficacy
of
control
that
i
could
not
until
later
realize
the
extent
of
the
sacrifices
that
were
to
be
exacted
of
me
and
of
those
who
supported
my
campaign
the
very
idea
of
birth
control
resurrected
the
spirit
of
the
of
salem
could
they
have
usurped
the
power
they
would
have
burned
us
at
the
stake
lacking
that
power
they
used
the
weapon
of
suppression
and
invoked
medieval
statutes
to
send
us
to
jail
these
tactics
had
an
effect
the
very
opposite
to
that
intended
they
demonstrated
the
vitality
of
the
idea
of
birth
control
and
acted
as
on
the
actively
intelligent
sections
of
the
american
community
nor
was
the
interest
aroused
confined
merely
to
america
the
movement
in
great
britain
with
its
history
of
undaunted
bravery
came
to
our
support
and
i
had
the
comfort
of
knowing
that
the
finest
minds
of
england
did
not
hesitate
a
moment
in
the
expression
of
their
sympathy
and
support
in
america
on
the
other
hand
i
found
from
the
beginning
until
very
recently
that
the
intellectuals
exhibited
a
curious
and
almost
inexplicable
reticence
in
supporting
birth
control
they
even
hesitated
to
voice
any
public
protest
against
the
campaign
to
crush
us
which
was
inaugurated
and
sustained
by
the
most
reactionary
and
sinister
forces
in
american
life
it
was
not
inertia
or
any
lack
of
interest
on
the
part
of
the
masses
that
stood
in
our
way
it
was
the
indifference
of
the
intellectual
leaders
writers
teachers
ministers
editors
who
form
a
class
dictating
if
not
creating
public
opinion
are
in
this
country
singularly
inhibited
or
unconscious
of
their
true
function
in
the
community
one
of
their
first
duties
it
is
certain
should
be
to
champion
the
constitutional
right
of
free
speech
and
free
press
to
welcome
any
idea
that
tends
to
awaken
the
critical
attention
of
the
great
american
public
but
those
who
reveal
themselves
as
fully
cognizant
of
this
public
duty
are
in
the
minority
and
must
possess
more
than
average
courage
to
survive
the
enmity
such
an
attitude
provokes
one
of
the
chief
aims
of
the
present
volume
is
to
stimulate
american
intellectuals
to
abandon
the
mental
habits
which
prevent
them
from
seeing
human
nature
as
a
whole
instead
of
as
something
that
can
be
pigeonholed
into
various
compartments
or
classes
birth
control
affords
an
approach
to
the
study
of
humanity
because
it
cuts
through
the
limitations
of
current
methods
it
is
economic
biological
psychological
and
spiritual
in
its
aspects
it
awakens
the
vision
of
mankind
moving
and
changing
of
humanity
growing
and
developing
coming
to
fruition
of
a
race
creative
flowering
into
beautiful
expression
through
talent
and
genius
as
a
social
programme
birth
control
is
not
merely
concerned
with
population
questions
in
this
respect
it
is
a
distinct
step
in
advance
of
earlier
malthusian
doctrines
which
concerned
themselves
chiefly
with
economics
and
population
birth
control
concerns
itself
with
the
spirit
no
less
than
the
body
it
looks
for
the
liberation
of
the
spirit
of
woman
and
through
woman
of
the
child
motherhood
is
wasted
penalized
tortured
children
brought
into
the
world
by
unwilling
mothers
suffer
an
initial
handicap
that
can
not
be
measured
by
cold
statistics
their
lives
are
blighted
from
the
start
to
substantiate
this
fact
i
have
chosen
to
present
the
conclusions
of
reports
on
child
labor
and
records
of
defect
and
delinquency
published
by
organizations
with
no
bias
in
favour
of
birth
control
the
evidence
is
before
us
it
crowds
in
upon
us
from
all
sides
but
prior
to
this
new
approach
no
attempt
had
been
made
to
correlate
the
effects
of
the
blind
and
irresponsible
play
of
the
sexual
instinct
with
its
causes
the
duty
of
the
educator
and
the
intellectual
creator
of
public
opinion
is
in
this
connection
of
the
greatest
importance
for
centuries
official
moralists
priests
clergymen
and
teachers
statesmen
and
politicians
have
preached
the
doctrine
of
glorious
and
divine
fertility
we
are
confronted
with
the
spectacle
of
the
realization
of
this
doctrine
it
is
not
without
significance
that
the
moron
and
the
imbecile
set
the
pace
in
living
up
to
this
teaching
and
that
the
intellectuals
the
educators
the
archbishops
bishops
priests
who
are
most
insistent
on
it
are
the
staunchest
adherents
in
their
own
lives
of
celibacy
and
it
is
time
to
point
out
to
the
champions
of
unceasing
and
indiscriminate
fertility
the
results
of
their
teaching
one
of
the
greatest
difficulties
in
giving
to
the
public
a
book
of
this
type
is
the
impossibility
of
keeping
pace
with
the
events
and
changes
of
a
movement
that
is
now
throughout
the
world
striking
root
and
growing
the
changed
attitude
of
the
american
press
indicates
that
enlightened
public
opinion
no
longer
tolerates
a
policy
of
silence
upon
a
question
of
the
most
vital
importance
almost
simultaneously
in
england
and
america
two
incidents
have
broken
through
the
prejudice
and
the
guarded
silence
of
centuries
at
the
church
congress
in
birmingham
october
lord
dawson
the
king
physician
in
criticizing
the
report
of
the
lambeth
conference
concerning
birth
control
delivered
an
address
defending
this
practice
of
such
bravery
and
eloquence
that
it
could
not
be
ignored
this
address
electrified
the
entire
british
public
it
aroused
a
storm
of
abuse
and
yet
succeeded
as
no
propaganda
could
in
mobilizing
the
forces
of
progress
and
intelligence
in
the
support
of
the
cause
just
one
month
later
the
first
american
birth
control
conference
culminated
in
a
significant
and
dramatic
incident
at
the
close
of
the
conference
a
mass
meeting
was
scheduled
in
the
town
hall
new
york
city
to
discuss
the
morality
of
birth
control
harold
cox
editor
of
the
edinburgh
review
who
had
come
to
new
york
to
attend
the
conference
was
to
lead
the
discussion
it
seemed
only
natural
for
us
to
call
together
scientists
educators
members
of
the
medical
profession
and
theologians
of
all
denominations
to
ask
their
opinion
upon
this
uncertain
and
important
phase
of
the
controversy
letters
were
sent
to
eminent
men
and
women
in
different
parts
of
the
world
in
this
letter
we
asked
the
following
questions
is
a
menace
to
the
peace
of
the
world
would
the
legal
dissemination
of
scientific
birth
control
information
through
the
medium
of
clinics
by
the
medical
profession
be
the
most
logical
method
of
checking
the
problem
of
would
knowledge
of
birth
control
change
the
moral
attitude
of
men
and
women
toward
the
marriage
bond
or
lower
the
moral
standards
of
the
youth
of
the
country
do
you
believe
that
knowledge
which
enables
parents
to
limit
their
families
will
make
for
human
happiness
and
raise
the
moral
social
and
intellectual
standards
of
population
we
sent
this
questionnaire
not
only
to
those
who
we
thought
might
agree
with
us
but
we
sent
it
also
to
our
known
opponents
when
i
arrived
at
the
town
hall
the
entrance
was
guarded
by
policemen
they
told
me
there
would
be
no
meeting
before
my
arrival
our
executives
had
been
greeted
by
monsignor
dineen
secretary
of
archbishop
hayes
of
the
roman
catholic
archdiocese
who
informed
them
that
the
meeting
would
be
prohibited
on
the
ground
that
it
was
contrary
to
public
morals
the
police
had
closed
the
doors
when
they
opened
them
to
permit
the
exit
of
the
large
audience
which
had
gathered
cox
and
i
entered
i
attempted
to
exercise
my
constitutional
right
of
free
speech
but
was
prohibited
and
arrested
miss
mary
winsor
who
protested
against
this
unwarranted
arrest
was
likewise
dragged
off
to
the
police
station
the
case
was
dismissed
the
following
morning
the
ecclesiastic
instigators
of
the
affair
were
conspicuous
by
their
absence
from
the
police
court
but
the
incident
was
enough
to
expose
the
opponents
of
birth
control
and
the
extreme
methods
they
used
to
combat
our
progress
the
case
was
too
flagrant
too
gross
an
affront
to
pass
unnoticed
by
the
newspapers
the
progress
of
our
movement
was
indicated
in
the
changed
attitude
of
the
american
press
which
had
perceived
the
danger
to
the
public
of
the
unlawful
tactics
used
by
the
enemies
of
birth
control
in
preventing
open
discussion
of
a
vital
question
no
social
idea
has
inspired
its
advocates
with
more
bravery
tenacity
and
courage
than
birth
control
from
the
early
days
of
francis
place
and
richard
carlile
to
those
of
the
drysdales
and
edward
trulove
of
bradlaugh
and
annie
besant
its
advocates
have
faced
imprisonment
and
ostracism
in
the
whole
history
of
the
english
movement
there
has
been
no
more
courageous
figure
than
that
of
the
venerable
alice
drysdale
vickery
the
undaunted
who
has
bridged
the
silence
of
years
since
the
trial
she
stands
head
and
shoulders
above
the
professional
feminists
serenely
has
she
withstood
jeers
and
jests
she
continues
to
point
out
to
the
younger
generation
which
is
devoted
to
newer
palliatives
the
fundamental
relation
between
sex
and
hunger
the
first
american
birth
control
conference
held
at
the
same
time
as
the
washington
conference
for
the
limitation
of
armaments
marks
a
in
our
approach
to
social
problems
the
conference
made
evident
the
fact
that
in
every
field
of
scientific
and
social
endeavour
the
most
penetrating
thinkers
are
now
turning
to
the
consideration
of
our
problem
as
a
fundamental
necessity
to
american
civilization
they
are
coming
to
see
that
a
qualitative
factor
as
opposed
to
a
quantitative
one
is
of
primary
importance
in
dealing
with
the
great
masses
of
humanity
certain
fundamental
convictions
should
be
made
clear
here
the
programme
for
birth
control
is
not
a
charity
it
is
not
aiming
to
interfere
in
the
private
lives
of
poor
people
to
tell
them
how
many
children
they
should
have
nor
to
sit
in
judgment
upon
their
fitness
to
become
parents
it
aims
rather
to
awaken
responsibility
to
answer
the
demand
for
a
scientific
means
by
which
and
through
which
each
human
life
may
be
and
the
exponent
of
birth
control
in
short
is
convinced
that
social
regeneration
no
less
than
individual
regeneration
must
come
from
within
every
potential
parent
and
especially
every
potential
mother
must
be
brought
to
an
acute
realization
of
the
primary
and
individual
responsibility
of
bringing
children
into
this
world
not
until
the
parents
of
this
world
are
given
control
over
their
reproductive
faculties
will
it
be
possible
to
improve
the
quality
of
the
generations
of
the
future
or
even
to
maintain
civilization
at
its
present
level
only
when
given
intelligent
mastery
of
the
procreative
powers
can
the
great
mass
of
humanity
be
aroused
to
a
realization
of
responsibility
of
parenthood
we
have
come
to
the
conclusion
based
on
widespread
investigation
and
experience
that
education
for
parenthood
must
be
based
upon
the
needs
and
demands
of
the
people
themselves
an
idealistic
code
of
sexual
ethics
imposed
from
above
a
set
of
rules
devised
by
theorists
who
fail
to
take
into
account
the
living
conditions
and
desires
of
the
masses
can
never
be
of
the
slightest
value
in
effecting
change
in
the
customs
of
the
people
systems
so
imposed
in
the
past
have
revealed
their
woeful
inability
to
prevent
the
sexual
and
racial
chaos
into
which
the
world
has
drifted
the
universal
demand
for
practical
education
in
birth
control
is
one
of
the
most
hopeful
signs
that
the
masses
themselves
possess
the
divine
spark
of
regeneration
it
remains
for
the
courageous
and
the
enlightened
to
answer
this
demand
to
kindle
the
spark
to
direct
a
thorough
education
in
sex
hygiene
based
upon
this
intense
interest
birth
control
is
thus
the
entering
wedge
for
the
educator
in
answering
the
needs
of
these
thousands
upon
thousands
of
submerged
mothers
it
is
possible
to
use
their
interest
as
the
foundation
for
education
in
prophylaxis
hygiene
and
infant
welfare
the
potential
mother
can
then
be
shown
that
maternity
need
not
be
slavery
but
may
be
the
most
effective
avenue
to
and
upon
this
basis
only
may
we
improve
the
quality
of
the
race
the
lack
of
balance
between
the
of
the
unfit
and
the
fit
admittedly
the
greatest
present
menace
to
the
civilization
can
never
be
rectified
by
the
inauguration
of
a
cradle
competition
between
these
two
classes
the
example
of
the
inferior
classes
the
fertility
of
the
the
mentally
defective
the
should
not
be
held
up
for
emulation
to
the
mentally
and
physically
fit
and
therefore
less
fertile
parents
of
the
educated
and
classes
on
the
contrary
the
most
urgent
problem
is
how
to
limit
and
discourage
the
of
the
mentally
and
physically
defective
possibly
drastic
and
spartan
methods
may
be
forced
upon
american
society
if
it
continues
complacently
to
encourage
the
chance
and
chaotic
breeding
that
has
resulted
from
our
stupid
cruel
sentimentalism
to
effect
the
salvation
of
the
generations
of
the
future
nay
of
the
generations
of
our
greatest
need
first
of
all
is
the
ability
to
face
the
situation
without
flinching
to
cooperate
in
the
formation
of
a
code
of
sexual
ethics
based
upon
a
thorough
biological
and
psychological
understanding
of
human
nature
and
then
to
answer
the
questions
and
the
needs
of
the
people
with
all
the
intelligence
and
honesty
at
our
command
if
we
can
summon
the
bravery
to
do
this
we
shall
best
be
serving
the
pivotal
interests
of
civilization
to
conclude
this
introduction
my
initiation
as
i
have
confessed
was
primarily
an
emotional
one
my
interest
in
birth
control
was
awakened
by
experience
research
and
investigation
have
followed
our
effort
has
been
to
raise
our
program
from
the
plane
of
the
emotional
to
the
plane
of
the
scientific
any
social
progress
it
is
my
belief
must
purge
itself
of
sentimentalism
and
pass
through
the
crucible
of
science
we
are
willing
to
submit
birth
control
to
this
test
it
is
part
of
the
purpose
of
this
book
to
appeal
to
the
scientist
for
aid
to
arouse
that
interest
which
will
result
in
widespread
research
and
investigation
i
believe
that
my
personal
experience
with
this
idea
must
be
that
of
the
race
at
large
we
must
temper
our
emotion
and
enthusiasm
with
the
impersonal
determination
of
science
we
must
unite
in
the
task
of
creating
an
instrument
of
steel
strong
but
supple
if
we
are
to
triumph
finally
in
the
war
for
human
emancipation
chapter

conscripted
motherhood
their
poor
old
ravaged
and
stiffened
faces
their
poor
old
bodies
dried
up
with
ceaseless
toil
their
patient
souls
made
me
weep
they
are
our
conscripts
they
are
the
venerable
ones
whom
we
should
reverence
all
the
mystery
of
womanhood
seems
incarnated
in
their
ugly
being
the
mothers
the
mothers
ye
are
all
one
from
the
letters
of
william
james
motherhood
which
is
not
only
the
oldest
but
the
most
important
profession
in
the
world
has
received
few
of
the
benefits
of
civilization
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
a
civilization
devoted
to
that
publicly
professes
a
worship
of
mother
and
child
should
close
its
eyes
to
the
appalling
waste
of
human
life
and
human
energy
resulting
from
those
dire
consequences
of
leaving
the
whole
problem
of
to
chance
and
blind
instinct
it
would
be
untrue
to
say
that
among
the
civilized
nations
of
the
world
the
profession
of
motherhood
remains
in
a
barbarous
state
the
bitter
truth
is
that
motherhood
among
the
larger
part
of
our
population
does
not
rise
to
the
level
of
the
barbarous
or
the
primitive
conditions
of
life
among
the
primitive
tribes
were
rude
enough
and
severe
enough
to
prevent
the
unhealthy
growth
of
sentimentality
and
to
discourage
the
irresponsible
production
of
defective
children
moreover
there
is
ample
evidence
to
indicate
that
even
among
the
most
primitive
peoples
the
function
of
maternity
was
recognized
as
of
primary
and
central
importance
to
the
community
if
we
define
civilization
as
increased
and
increasing
responsibility
based
on
vision
and
foresight
it
becomes
painfully
evident
that
the
profession
of
motherhood
as
practised
is
in
no
sense
civilized
educated
people
derive
their
ideas
of
maternity
for
the
most
part
either
from
the
experience
of
their
own
set
or
from
visits
to
impressive
hospitals
where
women
of
the
upper
classes
receive
the
advantages
of
modern
science
and
modern
nursing
from
these
charming
pictures
they
derive
their
complacent
views
of
the
beauty
of
motherhood
and
their
confidence
for
the
future
of
the
race
the
other
side
of
the
picture
is
revealed
only
to
the
trained
investigator
to
the
patient
and
impartial
observer
who
visits
not
merely
one
or
two
homes
of
the
poor
but
makes
detailed
studies
of
town
after
town
obtains
the
history
of
each
mother
and
finally
correlates
and
analyzes
this
evidence
upon
such
a
basis
are
we
able
to
draw
conclusions
concerning
this
strange
business
of
bringing
children
into
the
world
every
year
i
receive
thousands
of
letters
from
women
in
all
parts
of
america
desperate
appeals
to
aid
them
to
extricate
themselves
from
the
trap
of
compulsory
maternity
lest
i
be
accused
of
bias
and
exaggeration
in
drawing
my
conclusions
from
these
painful
human
documents
i
prefer
to
present
a
number
of
typical
cases
recorded
in
the
reports
of
the
united
states
government
and
in
the
evidence
of
trained
and
impartial
investigators
of
social
agencies
more
generally
opposed
to
the
doctrine
of
birth
control
than
biased
in
favor
of
it
a
perusal
of
the
reports
on
infant
mortality
in
widely
varying
industrial
centers
of
the
united
states
published
during
the
past
decade
by
the
children
bureau
of
the
united
states
department
of
labor
forces
us
to
a
realization
of
the
immediate
need
of
detailed
statistics
concerning
the
practice
and
results
of
uncontrolled
breeding
some
such
effort
as
this
has
been
made
by
the
galton
laboratory
of
national
eugenics
in
great
britain
the
children
bureau
reports
only
incidentally
present
this
impressive
evidence
they
fail
to
coordinate
it
while
there
is
always
the
danger
of
drawing
giant
conclusions
from
pigmy
premises
here
is
overwhelming
evidence
concerning
irresponsible
parenthood
that
is
ignored
by
governmental
and
social
agencies
i
have
chosen
a
small
number
of
typical
cases
from
these
reports
though
drawn
from
widely
varying
sources
they
all
emphasize
the
greatest
crime
of
modern
civilization
that
of
permitting
motherhood
to
be
left
to
blind
chance
and
to
be
mainly
a
function
of
the
most
abysmally
ignorant
and
irresponsible
classes
of
the
community
here
is
a
fairly
typical
case
from
johnstown
pennsylvania
a
woman
of
years
had
undergone
thirteen
pregnancies
in
seventeen
years
of
eleven
live
births
and
two
premature
stillbirths
only
two
children
were
alive
at
the
time
of
the
government
agent
visit
the
second
to
eighth
the
eleventh
and
the
thirteenth
had
died
of
bowel
trouble
at
ages
ranging
from
three
weeks
to
four
months
the
only
cause
of
these
deaths
the
mother
could
give
was
that
food
did
not
agree
with
them
she
confessed
quite
frankly
that
she
believed
in
feeding
babies
and
gave
them
everything
anybody
told
her
to
give
them
she
began
to
give
them
at
the
age
of
one
month
bread
potatoes
egg
crackers
etc
for
the
last
baby
that
died
this
mother
had
bought
a
goat
and
gave
its
milk
to
the
baby
the
goat
got
sick
but
the
mother
continued
to
give
her
baby
its
milk
until
the
goat
went
dry
moreover
she
directed
the
feeding
of
her
daughter
baby
until
it
died
at
the
age
of
three
months
on
account
of
the
many
children
she
had
had
the
neighbors
consider
her
an
authority
on
baby
care
lest
this
case
be
considered
too
tragically
ridiculous
to
be
accepted
as
typical
the
reader
may
verify
it
with
an
almost
interminable
list
of
similar
cases
parental
irresponsibility
is
significantly
illustrated
in
another
case
a
mother
who
had
four
live
births
and
two
stillbirths
in
twelve
years
lost
all
of
her
babies
during
their
first
year
she
was
so
anxious
that
at
least
one
child
should
live
that
she
consulted
a
physician
concerning
the
care
of
the
last
one
upon
his
advice
to
quote
the
government
report
she
gave
up
her
twenty
boarders
immediately
after
the
birth
and
devoted
all
her
time
to
it
thinks
she
did
not
stop
her
hard
work
soon
enough
says
she
has
always
worked
too
hard
keeping
boarders
in
this
country
and
cutting
wood
and
carrying
it
and
water
on
her
back
in
the
old
country
also
says
the
carrying
of
water
and
cases
of
beer
in
this
country
is
a
great
strain
on
her
but
the
illuminating
point
in
this
case
is
that
the
father
was
furious
because
all
the
babies
died
to
show
his
disrespect
for
the
wife
who
could
only
give
birth
to
babies
that
died
he
wore
a
red
necktie
to
the
funeral
of
the
last
yet
this
woman
the
government
agent
reports
would
follow
and
profit
by
any
instruction
that
might
be
given
her
it
is
true
that
the
cases
reported
from
johnstown
pennsylvania
do
not
represent
completely
americanized
families
this
lack
does
not
prevent
them
however
by
their
unceasing
fertility
from
producing
the
americans
of
of
the
more
immediate
conditions
surrounding
we
are
presented
with
this
evidence
given
by
one
woman
concerning
the
birth
of
her
last
child
on
five
on
wednesday
evening
she
went
to
her
sister
house
to
return
a
washboard
after
finishing
a
day
washing
the
baby
was
born
while
she
was
there
her
sister
was
too
young
to
aid
her
in
any
way
she
was
not
accustomed
to
a
midwife
she
confessed
she
cut
the
cord
herself
washed
the
baby
at
her
sister
house
walked
home
cooked
supper
for
her
boarders
and
went
to
bed
by
eight
the
next
day
she
got
up
and
ironed
this
tired
her
out
she
said
so
she
stayed
in
bed
for
two
whole
days
she
milked
cows
the
day
after
the
birth
of
the
baby
and
sold
the
milk
as
well
later
in
the
week
when
she
became
tired
she
hired
someone
to
do
that
portion
of
her
work
this
woman
we
are
further
informed
kept
cows
chickens
and
lodgers
and
earned
additional
money
by
doing
laundry
and
charwork
at
times
her
husband
deserted
her
his
earnings
amounted
to
a
day
while
a
son
earned
in
a
coal
mine
one
searches
in
vain
for
some
picture
of
sacred
motherhood
as
depicted
in
popular
plays
and
motion
pictures
something
more
normal
and
encouraging
then
one
comes
to
the
bitter
realization
that
these
in
very
truth
are
the
normal
cases
not
the
exceptions
the
exceptions
are
apt
to
indicate
instead
the
close
relationship
of
this
irresponsible
and
chance
parenthood
to
the
great
social
problems
of
crime
and
syphilis
nor
is
this
type
of
motherhood
confined
to
newly
arrived
immigrant
mothers
as
a
government
report
from
akron
ohio
sufficiently
indicates
in
this
city
the
government
agents
discovered
that
more
than
five
hundred
mothers
were
ignorant
of
the
accepted
principles
of
infant
feeding
or
if
familiar
with
them
did
not
practise
them
this
ignorance
or
indifference
was
not
confined
to
mothers
a
native
mother
reported
that
she
gave
her
baby
ice
cream
and
that
before
his
sixth
month
he
was
sitting
at
the
table
everything
this
was
in
a
town
in
which
there
were
comparatively
few
cases
of
extreme
poverty
the
degradation
of
motherhood
the
damnation
of
the
next
generation
before
it
is
born
is
exposed
in
all
its
catastrophic
misery
in
the
reports
of
the
national
consumers
league
in
her
report
of
living
conditions
among
mothers
in
textile
mills
in
rhode
island
based
on
exhaustive
studies
florence
kelley
describes
the
normal
life
of
these
women
when
the
worker
cruelly
tired
from
ten
hours
work
comes
home
in
the
early
morning
she
usually
scrambles
together
breakfast
for
the
family
eating
little
or
nothing
herself
and
that
hastily
she
tumbles
into
bed
not
the
immaculate
bed
in
an
airy
with
dark
shades
but
one
still
warm
from
its
night
occupants
in
a
stuffy
little
darkened
imperfectly
if
at
all
after
sleeping
exhaustedly
for
an
hour
perhaps
she
bestirs
herself
to
get
the
children
off
to
school
or
care
for
insistent
little
ones
too
young
to
appreciate
that
mother
is
tired
out
and
must
sleep
perhaps
later
in
the
forenoon
she
again
drops
into
a
fitful
sleep
or
she
may
have
to
wait
until
after
dinner
there
is
the
midday
meal
to
get
and
if
her
husband
can
not
come
home
his
to
pack
with
a
hot
lunch
to
be
sent
or
carried
to
him
if
he
is
not
at
home
the
lunch
is
rather
a
makeshift
the
midday
meal
is
scarcely
over
before
supper
must
be
thought
of
this
has
to
be
eaten
hurriedly
before
the
family
are
ready
for
the
mother
must
be
in
the
mill
at
work
by
or
many
women
in
their
inadequate
english
summed
up
their
daily
routine
by
me
all
time
tired
too
much
work
too
much
baby
too
little
sleep
only
sixteen
of
the
married
women
were
without
children
had
three
or
more
twenty
had
children
one
year
old
or
under
there
were
children
under
below
six
years
and
of
school
age
a
woman
in
ordinary
circumstances
adds
this
impartial
investigator
with
a
husband
and
three
children
if
she
does
her
own
work
feels
that
her
hands
are
full
how
these
many
of
them
and
many
with
confessedly
poor
health
can
ever
do
two
jobs
is
a
mystery
when
they
are
seen
in
their
homes
dragging
about
pale
and
listless
often
needlessly
sharp
and
impatient
with
the
children
these
children
are
not
only
not
mothered
never
cherished
they
are
nagged
and
buffeted
the
mothers
are
not
superwomen
and
like
all
human
beings
they
have
a
certain
amount
of
strength
and
when
that
breaks
their
nerves
suffer
we
are
presented
with
a
vivid
picture
of
one
of
these
a
woman
of
who
looks
at
least
fifty
with
her
worn
furrowed
face
asked
why
she
had
been
working
at
night
for
the
past
two
years
she
pointed
to
a
old
baby
she
was
carrying
to
the
five
small
children
swarming
about
her
and
answered
laconically
too
much
children
she
volunteered
the
information
that
there
had
been
two
more
who
had
died
when
asked
why
they
had
died
the
poor
mother
shrugged
her
shoulders
listlessly
and
replied
do
know
in
addition
to
bearing
and
rearing
these
children
her
work
would
sap
the
vitality
of
any
ordinary
person
she
got
home
soon
after
four
in
the
morning
cooked
breakfast
for
the
family
and
ate
hastily
herself
at
she
was
in
bed
staying
there
until
eight
but
part
of
that
time
was
disturbed
for
the
children
were
noisy
and
the
apartment
was
a
tiny
dingy
place
in
a
basement
at
eight
she
started
the
three
oldest
boys
to
school
and
cleaned
up
the
debris
of
breakfast
and
of
supper
the
night
before
at
twelve
she
carried
a
hot
lunch
to
her
husband
and
had
dinner
ready
for
the
three
school
children
in
the
afternoon
there
were
again
dishes
and
cooking
and
caring
for
three
babies
aged
five
three
years
and
six
months
at
five
supper
was
ready
for
the
family
the
mother
ate
by
herself
and
was
off
to
work
at
another
of
the
mothers
was
a
frail
looking
frenchwoman
of
years
with
a
husband
and
five
children
ranging
from
eight
years
to
fourteen
months
three
other
children
had
died
when
visited
she
was
doing
a
huge
washing
she
was
forced
into
night
work
to
meet
the
expenses
of
the
family
she
estimated
that
she
succeeded
in
getting
five
hours
sleep
during
the
day
i
take
my
baby
to
bed
with
me
but
he
cries
and
my
little
boy
cries
too
and
comes
in
to
make
me
get
up
so
you
ca
call
that
a
very
good
sleep
the
problem
among
unmarried
women
or
those
without
family
is
not
the
same
this
investigator
points
out
they
sleep
longer
by
day
than
they
normally
would
by
night
we
are
also
informed
that
pregnant
women
work
at
night
in
the
mills
sometimes
up
to
the
very
hour
of
delivery
queer
exclaimed
a
woman
supervisor
of
one
of
the
rhode
island
mills
but
some
women
both
on
the
day
and
the
night
shift
will
stick
to
their
work
right
up
to
the
last
minute
and
will
use
every
means
to
deceive
you
about
their
condition
i
go
around
and
talk
to
them
but
make
little
impression
we
have
had
several
narrow
escapes
a
polish
mother
with
five
children
had
worked
in
a
mill
by
day
or
by
night
ever
since
her
marriage
stopping
only
to
have
her
babies
one
little
girl
had
died
several
years
ago
and
the
youngest
child
says
kelley
did
not
look
promising
it
had
none
of
the
charm
of
babyhood
its
body
and
clothing
were
filthy
and
its
lower
lip
and
chin
covered
with
repulsive
black
sores
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
consumers
league
which
publishes
these
reports
on
women
in
industry
is
not
advocating
birth
control
education
but
is
aiming
to
awaken
responsibility
for
conditions
under
which
goods
are
produced
and
through
investigation
education
and
legislation
to
mobilize
public
opinion
in
behalf
of
enlightened
standards
for
workers
and
honest
products
for
all
nevertheless
in
miss
agnes
de
lima
report
of
conditions
in
passaic
new
jersey
we
find
the
same
tale
of
penalized
prostrate
motherhood
bearing
the
crushing
burden
of
economic
injustice
and
cruelty
the
same
blind
but
overpowering
instincts
of
love
and
hunger
driving
young
women
into
the
factories
to
work
night
in
and
night
out
to
support
their
procession
of
uncared
for
and
undernourished
babies
it
is
the
married
women
with
young
children
who
work
on
the
shifts
they
are
driven
to
it
by
the
low
wages
of
their
husbands
they
choose
night
work
in
order
to
be
with
their
children
in
the
daytime
they
are
afraid
of
the
neglect
and
the
children
might
receive
at
the
hands
of
paid
caretakers
thus
they
condemn
themselves
to
eighteen
or
twenty
hours
of
daily
toil
surely
no
mother
with
three
four
five
or
six
children
can
secure
much
rest
by
day
take
almost
any
house
we
read
in
the
report
of
conditions
in
new
jersey
knock
at
almost
any
door
and
you
will
find
a
weary
tousled
woman
doing
her
housework
or
trying
to
snatch
an
hour
or
two
of
sleep
after
her
long
night
of
work
in
the
mill
the
facts
are
there
for
any
one
to
see
the
hopeless
and
exhausted
woman
her
cluttered
three
or
four
rooms
the
swarm
of
sickly
and
neglected
children
these
women
claimed
that
night
work
was
unavoidable
as
their
husbands
received
so
little
pay
this
in
spite
of
all
our
vaunted
high
wages
only
three
women
were
found
who
went
into
the
drudgery
of
night
work
without
being
obliged
to
do
so
two
had
no
children
and
their
earnings
were
sufficient
for
their
needs
one
of
these
was
saving
for
a
trip
to
europe
and
chose
the
night
shift
because
she
found
it
less
strenuous
than
the
day
only
four
of
the
hundred
women
reported
upon
were
unmarried
and
of
the
married
women
had
children
of
the
four
childless
married
women
one
had
lost
two
children
and
another
was
recovering
from
a
recent
miscarriage
there
were
five
widows
the
average
number
of
children
was
three
in
a
family
of
the
mothers
had
four
or
more
three
of
them
had
six
children
and
six
of
them
had
seven
children
apiece
these
women
ranged
between
the
ages
of
and
forty
and
more
than
half
the
children
were
less
than
seven
years
of
age
most
of
them
had
babies
of
one
two
and
three
years
of
age
at
the
risk
of
repetition
we
quote
one
of
the
typical
cases
reported
by
miss
de
lima
with
features
practically
identical
with
the
individual
cases
reported
from
rhode
island
it
is
of
a
mother
who
comes
home
from
work
at
every
morning
falls
on
the
bed
from
exhaustion
arises
again
at
eight
or
nine
to
see
that
the
older
children
are
sent
off
to
school
a
son
of
five
like
the
rest
of
the
children
is
on
a
diet
of
coffee
milk
costs
too
much
after
the
children
have
left
for
school
the
overworked
mother
again
tries
to
sleep
though
the
small
son
bothers
her
a
great
deal
besides
she
must
clean
the
house
wash
iron
mend
sew
and
prepare
the
midday
meal
she
tries
to
snatch
a
little
sleep
in
the
afternoon
but
explains
when
you
got
big
family
all
time
work
in
mill
drag
so
long
so
long
in
home
go
so
quick
by
five
this
mother
must
get
the
family
supper
ready
and
dress
for
the
night
work
which
begins
at
seven
the
investigator
further
reports
the
next
day
was
a
holiday
and
for
a
diversion
thought
she
would
go
up
to
the
cemetery
got
some
children
up
there
she
explained
same
time
i
get
some
air
no
i
do
go
nowheres
just
to
the
mill
and
then
home
here
again
as
in
all
reports
on
women
in
industry
we
find
the
prevalence
of
pregnant
women
working
on
often
to
the
very
day
of
their
delivery
oh
yes
plenty
women
big
bellies
work
in
the
night
time
one
of
the
toiling
mothers
volunteered
shame
they
go
but
what
can
do
the
abuse
was
general
many
mothers
confessed
that
owing
to
poverty
they
themselves
worked
up
to
the
last
week
or
even
day
before
the
birth
of
their
children
births
were
even
reported
in
one
of
the
mills
during
the
night
shift
a
foreman
told
of
permitting
a
woman
to
leave
at
one
morning
and
of
the
birth
of
her
baby
at
several
women
told
of
leaving
the
because
of
pregnancy
and
of
securing
places
on
the
where
their
condition
was
less
conspicuous
and
the
bosses
more
tolerant
one
mother
defended
her
right
to
stay
at
work
says
the
report
claiming
that
as
long
as
she
could
do
her
work
it
was
nobody
business
in
a
doorway
sat
a
sickly
and
bloodless
woman
in
an
advanced
stage
of
pregnancy
her
first
baby
had
died
of
general
debility
she
had
worked
at
night
in
the
mill
until
the
very
day
of
its
birth
this
time
the
boss
had
told
her
she
could
stay
if
she
wished
but
reminded
her
of
what
had
happened
last
time
so
she
had
stopped
work
as
the
baby
was
expected
any
day
again
and
again
we
read
the
same
story
which
varied
only
in
detail
the
mother
in
the
three
black
rooms
the
sagging
porch
overflowing
with
pale
and
sickly
children
the
mother
of
seven
still
nursing
her
youngest
who
is
two
or
three
months
old
worn
and
haggard
with
a
child
pulling
at
her
breast
the
women
tries
to
make
the
investigator
understand
the
grandmother
helps
to
interpret
she
never
sleeps
explains
the
old
woman
how
can
she
with
so
many
children
she
works
up
to
the
last
moment
before
her
baby
comes
and
returns
to
work
as
soon
as
they
are
four
weeks
old
another
apartment
in
the
same
house
another
of
those
mothers
who
had
just
stopped
because
she
is
pregnant
the
boss
had
kindly
given
her
permission
to
stay
on
but
she
found
the
reaching
on
the
heavy
spinning
machines
too
hard
three
children
ranging
in
age
from
five
to
twelve
years
are
all
sickly
and
forlorn
and
must
be
cared
for
there
is
a
tubercular
husband
who
is
unable
to
work
steadily
and
is
able
to
bring
in
only
a
week
two
of
the
babies
had
died
one
because
the
mother
had
returned
to
work
too
soon
after
its
birth
and
had
lost
her
milk
she
had
fed
him
tea
and
bread
so
he
died
the
most
heartrending
feature
of
it
all
in
these
homes
of
the
mothers
who
work
at
night
is
the
expression
in
the
faces
of
the
children
children
of
chance
dressed
in
rags
undernourished
underclothed
all
predisposed
to
the
ravages
of
chronic
and
epidemic
disease
the
reports
on
infant
mortality
published
under
the
direction
of
the
children
bureau
substantiate
for
the
united
states
of
america
the
findings
of
the
galton
laboratory
for
great
britain
showing
that
an
abnormally
high
rate
of
fertility
is
usually
associated
with
poverty
filth
disease
feeblemindedness
and
a
high
infant
mortality
rate
it
is
a
commonplace
truism
that
a
high
is
accompanied
by
a
high
rate
no
longer
is
it
necessary
to
dissociate
cause
and
effect
to
try
to
determine
whether
the
high
birth
rate
is
the
cause
of
the
high
infant
mortality
rate
it
is
sufficient
to
know
that
they
are
organically
correlated
along
with
other
factors
detrimental
to
individual
national
and
racial
welfare
the
figures
presented
by
hibbs
likewise
reveal
a
much
higher
infant
mortality
rate
for
the
later
born
children
of
large
families
the
statistics
which
show
that
the
greatest
number
of
children
are
born
to
parents
whose
earnings
are
the
lowest
that
the
direst
poverty
is
associated
with
uncontrolled
fecundity
emphasize
the
character
of
the
parenthood
we
are
depending
upon
to
create
the
race
of
the
future
a
distinguished
american
opponent
of
birth
control
some
years
ago
spoke
of
the
racial
value
of
this
high
infant
mortality
rate
among
the
unfit
he
forgot
however
that
the
of
the
children
born
of
these
overworked
and
fatigued
mothers
may
nevertheless
be
large
enough
aided
and
abetted
by
philanthropies
and
charities
to
form
the
greater
part
of
the
population
of
as
karl
pearson
has
stated
degenerate
stocks
under
present
social
conditions
are
not
they
live
to
have
more
than
the
normal
size
of
family
reports
of
charitable
organizations
the
famous
one
hundred
neediest
cases
presented
every
year
by
the
new
york
times
to
arouse
the
sentimental
generosity
of
its
readers
statistics
of
public
and
private
hospitals
charities
and
corrections
analyses
of
pauperism
in
town
and
country
all
tell
the
same
tale
of
uncontrolled
and
irresponsible
fecundity
the
facts
the
figures
the
appalling
truth
are
there
for
all
to
read
it
is
only
in
the
remedy
proposed
the
effective
solution
that
investigators
and
students
of
the
problem
disagree
confronted
with
the
startling
and
disgraceful
conditions
of
affairs
indicated
by
the
fact
that
a
quarter
of
a
million
babies
die
every
year
in
the
united
states
before
they
are
one
year
old
and
that
no
less
than
women
die
in
childbirth
a
large
number
of
experts
and
enthusiasts
have
placed
their
hopes
in
measures
such
measures
sharply
illustrate
the
superficial
and
fragmentary
manner
in
which
the
whole
problem
of
motherhood
is
studied
it
seeks
a
laisser
faire
policy
of
parenthood
or
marriage
with
an
indiscriminating
paternalism
concerning
maternity
it
is
as
though
the
government
were
to
say
increase
and
multiply
we
shall
assume
the
responsibility
of
keeping
your
babies
alive
even
granting
that
the
administration
of
these
measures
might
be
made
effective
and
effectual
which
is
more
than
doubtful
we
see
that
they
are
based
upon
a
complete
ignorance
or
disregard
of
the
most
important
fact
in
the
situation
that
of
indiscriminate
and
irresponsible
fecundity
they
tacitly
assume
that
all
parenthood
is
desirable
that
all
children
should
be
born
and
that
infant
mortality
can
be
controlled
by
external
aid
in
the
great
of
creating
the
men
and
women
of
it
is
not
merely
a
question
of
sustaining
the
lives
of
all
children
irrespective
of
their
hereditary
and
physical
qualities
to
the
point
where
they
in
turn
may
reproduce
their
kind
advocates
of
birth
control
offer
and
accept
no
such
superficial
solution
this
philosophy
is
based
upon
a
clearer
vision
and
a
more
profound
comprehension
of
human
life
of
immediate
relief
for
the
crushed
and
enslaved
motherhood
of
the
world
through
state
aid
no
better
criticism
has
been
made
than
that
of
havelock
ellis
to
the
theoretical
philanthropist
eager
to
reform
the
world
on
paper
nothing
seems
simpler
than
to
cure
the
present
evils
of
by
setting
up
state
nurseries
which
are
at
once
to
relieve
mothers
of
everything
connected
with
the
men
of
the
future
beyond
the
pleasure
if
such
it
happens
to
be
of
conceiving
them
and
the
trouble
of
bearing
them
and
at
the
same
time
to
rear
them
up
independently
of
the
home
in
a
wholesome
economical
and
scientific
manner
nothing
seems
simpler
but
from
the
fundamental
psychological
point
of
view
nothing
is
falser
a
state
which
admits
that
the
individuals
composing
it
are
incompetent
to
perform
their
most
sacred
and
intimate
functions
and
takes
it
upon
itself
to
perform
them
itself
instead
attempts
a
task
that
would
be
undesirable
even
if
it
were
possible
of
achievement
it
may
be
replied
that
maternity
benefit
measures
aim
merely
to
aid
mothers
more
adequately
to
fulfil
their
biological
and
social
functions
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
birth
control
that
will
never
be
possible
until
the
crushing
exigencies
of
overcrowding
are
removed
overcrowding
of
pregnancies
as
well
as
of
homes
as
long
as
the
mother
remains
the
passive
victim
of
blind
instinct
instead
of
the
conscious
responsible
instrument
of
the
controlling
and
directing
its
expression
there
can
be
no
solution
to
the
intricate
and
complex
problems
that
confront
the
whole
world
this
is
of
course
impossible
as
long
as
women
are
driven
into
the
factories
on
night
as
well
as
day
shifts
as
long
as
children
and
girls
and
young
women
are
driven
into
industries
to
labor
that
is
physically
deteriorating
as
a
preparation
for
the
supreme
function
of
maternity
the
philosophy
of
birth
control
insists
that
motherhood
no
less
than
any
other
human
function
must
undergo
scientific
study
must
be
voluntarily
directed
and
controlled
with
intelligence
and
foresight
as
long
as
we
countenance
what
wells
has
well
termed
the
monstrous
absurdity
of
women
discharging
their
supreme
social
function
bearing
and
rearing
children
in
their
spare
time
as
it
were
while
they
their
living
by
contributing
some
element
to
some
trivial
industrial
product
any
attempt
to
furnish
maternal
education
is
bound
to
fall
on
stony
ground
children
brought
into
the
world
as
the
chance
consequences
of
the
blind
play
of
uncontrolled
instinct
become
likewise
the
helpless
victims
of
their
environment
it
is
because
children
are
cheaply
conceived
that
the
infant
mortality
rate
is
high
but
the
greatest
evil
perhaps
the
greatest
crime
of
our
civilization
of
is
not
to
be
gauged
by
the
rate
in
truth
unfortunate
babies
who
depart
during
their
first
twelve
months
are
more
fortunate
in
many
respects
than
those
who
survive
to
undergo
punishment
for
their
parents
cruel
ignorance
and
complacent
fecundity
if
motherhood
is
wasted
under
the
present
regime
of
glorious
fertility
childhood
is
not
merely
wasted
but
actually
destroyed
let
us
look
at
this
matter
from
the

troop

from

failure
of
emotional
sentimental
and
idealistic
efforts
based
on
hysterical
enthusiasm
to
improve
social
conditions
is
nowhere
better
exemplified
than
in
the
undervaluation
of
a
few
years
ago
the
scandal
of
children
under
fourteen
working
in
cotton
mills
was
exposed
there
was
muckraking
and
agitation
a
wave
of
moral
indignation
swept
over
america
there
arose
a
loud
cry
for
immediate
action
then
having
more
or
less
successfully
settled
this
particular
matter
the
american
people
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
settled
back
and
complacently
congratulated
itself
that
the
problem
of
child
labor
had
been
settled
once
and
for
all
conditions
are
worse
than
before
not
only
is
there
child
labor
in
practically
every
state
in
the
union
but
we
are
now
forced
to
realize
the
evils
that
result
from
child
labor
of
child
laborers
now
grown
into
manhood
and
womanhood
but
we
wish
here
to
point
out
a
neglected
aspect
of
this
problem
child
labor
shows
us
how
cheaply
we
value
childhood
and
moreover
it
shows
us
that
cheap
childhood
is
the
inevitable
result
of
chance
parenthood
child
labor
is
organically
bound
up
with
the
problem
of
uncontrolled
breeding
and
the
large
family
the
selective
draft
of
which
was
designed
to
choose
for
military
service
only
those
fulfiling
definite
requirements
of
physical
and
mental
fitness
showed
some
of
the
results
of
child
labor
it
established
the
fact
that
the
majority
of
american
children
never
got
beyond
the
sixth
grade
because
they
were
forced
to
leave
school
at
that
time
our
compulsory
education
does
not
compel
and
does
not
educate
the
it
is
our
duty
to
emphasize
this
fact
revealed
that
per
cent
of
the
young
men
more
than
a
million
were
rejected
because
of
physical
and
defects
and
per
cent
were
illiterate
these
young
men
were
the
children
of
yesterday
authorities
tell
us
that
per
cent
of
the
are
defective
this
means
that
no
less
than
fifteen
million
schoolchildren
out
of
in
the
united
states
are
physically
or
mentally
below
par
this
is
the
soil
in
which
all
sorts
of
serious
evils
strike
root
it
is
a
truism
that
children
are
the
chief
asset
of
a
nation
yet
while
the
united
states
government
allotted
per
cent
of
its
appropriations
for
toward
war
expenses
three
per
cent
to
public
works
per
cent
to
primary
governmental
functions
no
more
than
one
per
cent
is
appropriated
to
education
research
and
development
of
this
one
per
only
a
small
proportion
is
devoted
to
public
health
the
conservation
of
childhood
is
a
minor
consideration
while
three
cents
is
spent
for
the
more
or
less
doubtful
protection
of
women
and
children
fifty
cents
is
given
to
the
bureau
of
animal
industry
for
the
protection
of
domestic
animals
in
the
state
of
kansas
appropriated
to
protect
the
health
of
pigs
and
to
protect
the
health
of
children
in
four
years
our
federal
government
appropriated
roughly
speaking
for
the
improvement
of
rivers
for
forest
conservation
for
the
experimental
plant
industry
for
the
experimental
animal
industry
to
combat
the
foot
and
mouth
disease
and
less
than
half
a
million
for
the
protection
of
child
life
competent
authorities
tell
us
that
no
less
than
per
cent
of
american
children
leave
school
between
the
ages
of
fourteen
and
sixteen
to
go
to
work
this
number
is
increasing
according
to
the
recently
published
report
on
the
administration
of
the
first
child
labor
law
in
five
states
in
which
it
was
necessary
for
the
children
bureau
to
handle
directly
the
working
certificates
of
children
of
the
children
who
applied
for
certificates
left
school
when
they
were
in
the
fourth
grade
nearly
a
tenth
of
them
had
never
attended
school
at
all
or
had
not
gone
beyond
the
first
grade
and
only
had
gone
as
far
as
the
eighth
grade
but
their
educational
equipment
was
even
more
limited
than
the
grade
they
attended
would
indicate
of
the
children
applying
to
go
to
work
had
not
advanced
further
than
the
first
grade
even
when
they
had
gone
to
school
at
all
could
not
even
sign
their
own
names
legibly
and
nearly
of
them
could
not
write
at
all
the
report
brings
automatically
into
view
the
vicious
circle
of
illiteracy
bodily
and
mental
defect
poverty
and
delinquency
and
like
all
reports
on
child
labor
the
large
family
and
reckless
breeding
looms
large
in
the
background
as
one
of
the
chief
factors
in
the
problem
despite
all
our
boasting
of
the
american
public
school
of
the
equal
opportunity
afforded
to
every
child
in
america
we
have
the
shortest
and
the
shortest
of
any
of
the
civilized
countries
in
the
united
states
of
america
there
are
illiterates
to
every
thousand
people
in
england
there
are
per
thousand
sweden
and
norway
have
one
per
thousand
the
united
states
is
the
most
illiterate
country
in
the
world
that
is
of
the
civilized
countries
of
the
illiterates
in
the
united
states
per
cent
are
white
and
per
cent
native
whites
illiteracy
not
only
is
the
index
of
inequality
of
opportunity
it
speaks
as
well
a
lack
of
consideration
for
the
children
it
means
either
that
children
have
been
forced
out
of
school
to
go
to
work
or
that
they
are
mentally
and
physically
defective
one
is
tempted
to
ask
why
a
society
which
has
failed
so
lamentably
to
protect
the
already
existing
child
life
upon
which
its
very
perpetuation
depends
takes
upon
itself
the
reckless
encouragement
of
indiscriminate
procreation
the
united
states
government
has
recently
inaugurated
a
policy
of
restricting
immigration
from
foreign
countries
until
it
is
able
to
protect
childhood
from
criminal
exploitation
until
it
has
made
possible
a
reasonable
hope
of
life
liberty
and
growth
for
american
children
it
should
likewise
recognize
the
wisdom
of
voluntary
restriction
in
the
production
of
children
reports
on
child
labor
published
by
the
national
child
labor
committee
only
incidentally
reveal
the
correlation
of
this
evil
with
that
of
large
families
yet
this
is
evident
throughout
the
investigators
are
more
bent
upon
regarding
child
labor
as
a
cause
of
illiteracy
but
it
is
no
less
a
consequence
of
irresponsibility
in
breeding
a
sinister
aspect
of
this
is
revealed
by
theresa
wolfson
study
of
in
the
of
michigan
as
one

further
illuminating
details
are
given
by
miss
wolfson
why
did
they
come
to
the
most
frequently
families
with
large
numbers
of
children
said
that
they
felt
that
the
city
was
no
place
to
raise
children
things
too
expensive
and
children
ran
wild
in
the
country
all
the
children
could
work
living
conditions
are
abominable
and
unspeakably
wretched
an
old
woodshed
a
barn
and
occasionally
a
tottering
ramshackle
farmer
house
are
the
common
types
one
family
of
eleven
the
youngest
child
two
years
the
oldest
sixteen
years
lived
in
an
old
country
store
which
had
but
one
window
the
wind
and
rain
came
through
the
holes
in
the
walls
the
ceiling
was
very
low
and
the
smoke
from
the
stove
filled
the
room
here
the
family
ate
slept
cooked
and
washed
in

a
family
of
six
was
found
living
in
a
shack
with
no
windows
light
and
ventilation

secured

in

and
brought

the

of

made
it
almost
unbearable

social
philosophers
of
a
certain
school
advocate
the
return
to
the
land
it
is
only
in
the
overcrowded
city
they
claim
that
the
evils
resulting
from
the
large
family
are
possible
there
is
according
to
this
philosophy
no
overcrowding
no
in
the
country
where
in
the
open
air
and
sunlight
every
child
has
an
opportunity
for
health
and
growth
this
idyllic
conception
of
american
country
life
does
not
correspond
with
the
picture
presented
by
this
investigator
who
points
out
to
promote
the
physical
and
mental
development
of
the
child
we
forbid
his
employment
in
factories
shops
and
stores
on
the
other
hand
we
are
prone
to
believe
that
the
right
kind
of
is
healthful
and
the
best
thing
for
children
but
for
a
child
to
crawl
along
the
ground
weeding
beets
in
the
hot
sun
for
fourteen
hours
a
day
the
average
workday
is
far
from
being
the
best
thing
the
law
of
compensation
is
bound
to
work
in
some
way
and
the
immediate
result
of
this
agricultural
work
is
interference
with
school
attendance
how
closely
related
this
form
of
is
to
the
family
is
definitely
illustrated
in
the
one
hundred
and
families
visited
there
were
six
hundred
children
a
conversation
held
with
a
woman
is
indicative
of
the
size
of
most
of
the
families
how
many

families
with
ten
and
twelve
children
were
frequently
found
while
those
of
six
and
eight
children
are
the
general
rule
the
advantage
of
a
large
family
in
the
beet
fields
is
that
it
does
the
most
work
in
the
one
hundred
families
interviewed
there
were
one
hundred
children
under
the
age
of
six
years
ranging
from
eight
weeks
up
children
between
the
ages
of
six
and
eight
approximately
of
whom
had
never
been
to
school
and
eleven
over
sixteen
years
of
age
who
had
never
been
to
school
one
boy
had
never
been
to
school
because
he
was
a
mental
defective
one
child
of
nine
was
practically
blinded
by
cataracts
this
child
was
found
groping
his
way
down
the
pulling
out
weeds
and
feeling
for
the
in
the
glare
of
the
sun
he
had
lost
all
sense
of
light
and
dark
of
the
three
hundred
and
forty
children
who
were
not
going
or
had
never
gone
to
school
only
four
had
reached
the
point
of
graduation
and
only
one
had
gone
to
high
school
these
large
families
migrated
to
the
in
early
spring
per
cent
of
them
are
retarded
when
we
realize
that
is
arrested
development
and
retardation
we
see
that
these
beet
children
are
artificially
retarded
in
their
growth
and
that
the
tendency
is
to
reduce
their
intelligence
to
the
level
of
the
congenital
imbecile
nor
must
it
be
concluded
that
these
large
beet
families
are
always
the
ignorant
foreigner
so
despised
by
our
respectable
press
the
following
case
throws
some
light
on
this
matter
reported
in
the
same
pamphlet
an
american
family
considered
a
prize
by
the
agent
because
of
the
fact
that
there
were
nine
children
turned
out
to
be
a
they
could
not
work
in
the
they
ran
up
a
bill
at
the
and
one
day
the
father
and
the
eldest
son
a
boy
of
nineteen
were
seen
running
through
the
railroad
station
to
catch
an
train
the
grocer
thought
they
were
their
bill
he
telephoned
ahead
to
the
sheriff
of
the
next
town
they
were
taken
off
the
train
by
the
sheriff
and
given
the
option
of
going
back
to
the
farm
or
staying
in
jail
they
preferred
to
stay
in
jail
and
remained
there
for
two
weeks
meanwhile
the
mother
and
her
eight
children
ranging
in
ages
form
seventeen
years
to
nine
months
had
to
manage
the
best
way
they
could
at
the
end
of
two
weeks
father
and
son
were
set
free
during
all
of
this
period
the
farmers
of
the
community
sent
in
provisions
to
keep
the
wife
and
children
from
starving
does
this
case
not
sum
up
in
a
nutshell
the
typical
american
intelligence
confronted
with
the
problem
of
the
family
industrial
slavery
tempered
with
sentimentality
let
us
turn
to
a
young
possibly
a
more
progressive
state
consider
the
case
of
california
the
golden
as
it
is
named
by
emma
duke
in
her
study
of
in
the
imperial
valley
as
fertile
as
the
valley
of
the
nile
here
cotton
is
king
and
rich
ranchers
absentee
landlords
and
others
exploit
it
less
than
ten
years
ago
ranchers
would
bring
in
hordes
of
laboring
families
but
refuse
to
assume
any
responsibility
in
housing
them
merely
permitting
them
to
sleep
on
the
grounds
of
the
ranch
conditions
have
been
somewhat
improved
but
sometimes
we
read
a
one
roomed
straw
house
with
an
area
of
fifteen
by
twenty
feet
will
serve
as
a
home
for
an
entire
family
which
not
only
cooks
but
sleeps
in

some
of
these
children
it
seems
wanted
to
attend
school
but
their
fathers
did
not
want
to
work
so
the
children
were
forced
to
become
one
man
whose
children
were
working
with
him
in
the
fields
said
please
lady
do
send
them
to
school
let
them
pick

i

paid
for
yet
the
native
white
american
mother
of
children
working
in
the
fields
proudly
remarked
no
they
never
been
to
school
nor
me
nor
their
poppy
nor
their
granddads
and
grandmoms
we
always
been
pickers
and
she
spat
her
tobacco
over
the
field
in
expert
fashion
in
the
valley
one
hears
from
townspeople
writes
the
investigator
that
pickers
make
ten
dollars
a
day
working
the
whole
family
with
that
qualification
the
statement
is
ambiguous
one
mexican
in
the
imperial
valley
was
the
father
of
children
thirteen
or
fourteen
living
he
said
if
they
all
worked
at
they
would
doubtless
altogether
make
more
than
ten
dollars
a
day
one
of
the
child
laborers
revealed
the
economic
advantage
to
the
parents
in
numerous
progeny
us
kids
most
always
drag
from
forty
to
fifty

of
cotton

we
take

my

her

my
little
brother
is

and
his

is

long
evidence
abounds
in
the
publications
of
the
national
child
labor
committee
of
this
type
of
fecund
parenthood
it
is
not
merely
a
question
of
the
large
family
versus
the
small
family
even
comparatively
small
families
among
migratory
workers
of
this
sort
have
been
large
families
the
high
infant
mortality
rate
has
carried
off
the
weaker
children
those
who
survive
are
merely
those
who
have
been
strong
enough
to
survive
the
most
unfavorable
living
conditions
no
it
is
a
situation
not
unique
nor
even
unusual
in
human
history
of
greed
and
stupidity
and
cupidity
encouraging
the
procreative
instinct
toward
the
manufacture
of
slaves
we
hear
these
days
of
the
selfishness
and
the
degradation
of
healthy
and
women
who
refuse
motherhood
but
we
hear
little
of
the
more
sinister
selfishness
of
men
and
women
who
bring
babies
into
the
world
to
become
of
the
kind
described
in
these
reports
of
child
labor
the
history
of
child
labor
in
the
english
factories
in
the
nineteenth
century
throws
a
suggestive
light
on
this
situation
these
were
really
called
into
being
by
the
industrial
situation
the
population
grew
as
dean
inge
has
described
it
like
crops
in
a
newly
irrigated
desert
during
the
nineteenth
century
the
numbers
were
nearly
quadrupled
let
those
who
think
that
the
population
of
a
country
can
be
increased
at
will
consider
whether
it
is
likely
that
any
physical
moral
or
psychological
change
came
over
the
nation
with
the
inventions
of
the
spinning
jenny
and
the
steam
engine
it
is
too
obvious
for
dispute
that
it
was
the
possession
of
capital
wanting
employment
and
of
natural
advantages
for
using
it
that
called
those
multitudes
of
human
beings
into
existence
to
eat
the
food
which
they
paid
for
by
their
labor
but
when
child
labor
in
the
factories
became
such
a
scandal
and
such
a
disgrace
that
was
finally
forbidden
by
laws
that
possessed
the
advantage
over
our
own
that
they
were
enforced
the
proletariat
ceased
to
supply
children
almost
by
magic
the
birth
rate
among
the
workers
declined
since
children
were
no
longer
of
economic
value
to
the
factories
they
were
evidently
a
drug
in
the
home
this
movement
it
should
not
be
forgotten
however
was
coincident
with
the
agitation
and
education
in
birth
control
stimulated
by
the
trial
large
families
among
migratory
agricultural
laborers
in
our
own
country
are
likewise
brought
into
existence
in
response
to
an
industrial
demand
the
enforcement
of
the
child
labor
laws
and
the
extension
of
their
restrictions
are
therefore
an
urgent
necessity
not
so
much
as
some
of
our
authorities
believe
to
enable
these
children
to
go
to
school
as
to
prevent
the
recruiting
of
our
next
generation
from
the
least
intelligent
and
most
unskilled
classes
in
the
community
as
long
as
we
officially
encourage
and
countenance
the
production
of
large
families
the
evils
of
child
labor
will
confront
us
on
the
other
hand
the
prohibition
of
child
labor
may
help
as
in
the
case
of
english
factories
in
the
decline
of
the
birth
rate
uncontrolled
breeding
and
child
labor
go
hand
in
hand
and
when
we
are
confronted
with
the
evils
of
the
latter
in
the
form
of
widespread
illiteracy
and
defect
we
should
seek
causes
more
deeply
rooted
than
the
enslavement
of
children
the
cost
to
society
is
incalculable
as
the
national
child
labor
committee
points
out
it
is
not
only
through
the
lowered
power
the
stunting
and
the
moral
degeneration
of
its
individual
members
but
in
actual
expense
through
the
necessary
provision
for
the
human
junk
created
by
premature
employment
in
hospitals
police
and
courts
jails
and
by
charitable
organizations
we
are
paying
for
the
folly
of
the
and
its
consequences
in
permanent
injury
to
plastic
childhood
of
yesterday
we
shall
be
forced
to
pay
for
our
ruthless
disregard
of
our
surplus
children
of
the
of
one
or
two
decades
ago
has
become
the
shifting
laborer
of
stunted
underfed
illiterate
unskilled
unorganized
and
unorganizable
he
is
the
last
person
to
be
hired
and
the
first
to
be
fired
boys
and
girls
under
fourteen
years
of
age
are
no
longer
permitted
to
work
in
factories
mills
canneries
and
establishments
whose
products
are
to
be
shipped
out
of
the
particular
state
and
children
under
sixteen
can
no
longer
work
in
mines
and
quarries
but
this
affects
only
one
quarter
of
our
army
of
child
labor
work
in
local
industries
stores
and
farms
homework
in
dark
and
unsanitary
tenements
is
still
permitted
children
work
in
homes
on
artificial
flowers
finishing
shoddy
garments
sewing
their
very
life
blood
and
that
of
the
race
into
tawdry
clothes
and
gewgaws
that
are
the
most
unanswerable
comments
upon
our
vaunted
civilization
and
we
must
not
forget
the
of
yesterday
is
becoming
the
father
or
the
mother
of
the
of
any
nation
that
works
its
women
is
damned
once
wrote
woods
hutchinson
the
nation
that
works
its
children
one
is
tempted
to
add
is
committing
suicide
defenders
of
american
democracy
pay
no
attention
to
the
strange
fact
that
although
the
average
education
among
all
american
adults
is
only
the
sixth
grade
every
one
of
these
adults
has
an
equal
power
at
the
polls
the
american
nation
with
all
its
worship
of
efficiency
and
thrift
complacently
forgets
that
every
child
defective
in
body
education
or
character
is
a
charge
upon
the
community
as
herbert
hoover
declared
in
an
address
before
the
american
child
hygiene
association
october
the
nation
as
a
whole
he
added
has
the
obligation
of
such
measures
toward
its
children
as
will
yield
to
them
an
equal
opportunity
at
their
start
in
life
if
we
could
grapple
with
the
whole
child
situation
for
one
generation
our
public
health
our
economic
efficiency
the
moral
character
sanity
and
stability
of
our
people
would
advance
three
generations
in
one
the
great
irrefutable
fact
that
is
ignored
or
neglected
is
that
the
american
nation
officially
places
a
low
value
upon
the
lives
of
its
children
the
brutal
truth
is
that
children
are
cheap
when
in
this
field
is
curtailed
by
voluntary
restriction
when
the
birth
rate
among
the
working
classes
takes
a
sharp
decline
the
value
of
children
will
rise
then
only
will
the
infant
mortality
rate
decline
and
child
labor
vanish
investigations
of
child
labor
emphasize
its
evils
by
pointing
out
that
these
children
are
kept
out
of
school
and
that
they
miss
the
advantages
of
american
public
school
education
they
express
the
current
confidence
in
compulsory
education
and
the
magical
benefits
to
be
derived
from
the
public
school
but
we
need
to
qualify
our
faith
in
education
and
particularly
our
faith
in
the
american
public
school
educators
are
just
beginning
to
wake
up
to
the
dangers
inherent
in
the
attempt
to
teach
the
brightest
child
and
the
mentally
defective
child
at
the
same
time
they
are
beginning
to
test
the
possibilities
of
a
vertical
classification
as
well
as
a
horizontal
one
that
is
each
class
must
be
divided
into
what
are
termed
gifted
bright
average
dull
normal
and
defective
in
the
past
the
crowding
and
together
of
all
classes
of
children
of
approximately
the
same
age
produced
only
a
dull
leveling
to
mediocrity
an
investigation
of
forty
schools
in
new
york
city
typical
of
hundreds
of
others
reveals
deplorable
conditions
of
overcrowding
and
lack
of

the
worst
conditions
are
to
be
found
in
locations

most
densely
populated

one
thousand

intricate

ever
alive
the
danger
of

only
the
eternal

served
to
lessen

of

in
the
schools
the
vision
of
the
children
is
regularly
tested
in
a
recent
test
of
this
character
it
was
found
in
public
school
the
rate
of
defective
vision
in
the
various
grades
ranged
from
to
per
in
public
school
the
rate
ranged
from
to
per
the
conditions
we
are
assured
are
no
exceptions
to
the
rule
of
public
schools
in
new
york
where
the
fatal
effects
of
overcrowding
in
education
may
be
observed
in
their
most
sinister
but
significant
aspects
the
forgotten
fact
in
this
case
is
that
efforts
for
universal
and
compulsory
education
can
not
keep
pace
with
the
overproduction
of
children
even
at
the
best
leaving
out
of
consideration
the
public
school
system
as
the
inevitable
prey
and
of
the
cheap
politician
and
present
methods
of
wholesale
and
syndicated
education
are
not
suited
to
compete
with
the
unceasing
unthinking
untiring
procreative
powers
of
our
swarming
spawning
populations
into
such
schools
as
described
in
the
recent
reports
of
the
public
education
association
no
intelligent
parent
would
dare
send
his
child
they
are
not
merely
and
of
infection
but
of
moral
and
intellectual
contamination
as
well
more
and
more
are
public
schools
in
america
becoming
institutions
for
subjecting
children
to
a
narrow
and
reactionary
orthodoxy
aiming
to
crush
out
all
signs
of
individuality
and
to
turn
out
boys
and
girls
compressed
into
a
standardized
pattern
with
ideas
on
politics
religion
morality
and
economics
true
education
can
not
grow
out
of
such
compulsory
herding
of
children
in
filthy
character
ability
and
reasoning
power
are
not
to
be
developed
in
this
fashion
indeed
it
is
to
be
doubted
whether
even
a
completely
successful
educational
system
could
offset
the
evils
of
indiscriminate
breeding
and
compensate
for
the
misfortune
of
being
a
superfluous
child
in
recognizing
the
great
need
of
education
we
have
failed
to
recognize
the
greater
need
of
inborn
health
and
character
if
it
were
necessary
to
choose
between
the
task
of
getting
children
educated
and
getting
them
well
born
and
healthy
writes
havelock
ellis
it
would
be
better
to
abandon
education
there
have
been
many
great
peoples
who
never
dreamed
of
national
systems
of
education
there
have
been
no
great
peoples
without
the
art
of
producing
healthy
and
vigorous
children
the
matter
becomes
of
peculiar
importance
in
great
industrial
states
like
england
the
united
states
and
germany
because
in
such
states
a
tacit
conspiracy
tends
to
grow
up
to
subordinate
national
ends
to
individual
ends
and
practically
to
work
for
the
deterioration
of
the
race
much
less
can
education
solve
the
great
problem
of
child
labor
rather
under
the
conditions
prevailing
in
modern
society
child
labor
and
the
failure
of
the
public
schools
to
educate
are
both
indices
of
a
more
deeply
rooted
evil
both
bespeak
the
undervaluation
of
the
child
this
undervaluation
this
cheapening
of
child
life
is
to
speak
crudely
but
frankly
the
direct
result
of
overproduction
restriction
of
output
is
an
immediate
necessity
if
we
wish
to
regain
control
of
the
real
values
so
that
unimpeded
unhindered
and
without
danger
of
inner
corruption

the
stupid
work
goes
on
of
preserving
and
increasing
our
socially
unfit
strains
the
philosophy
of
birth
control
points
out
that
as
long
as
civilized
communities
encourage
unrestrained
fecundity
in
the
normal
members
of
the
population
always
of
course
under
the
cloak
of
decency
and
morality
and
penalize
every
attempt
to
introduce
the
principle
of
discrimination
and
responsibility
in
parenthood
they
will
be
faced
with
the
problem
of
that
fertile
parent
of
degeneracy
crime
and
pauperism
small
as
the
percentage
of
the
imbecile
and
may
seem
in
comparison
with
the
normal
members
of
the
community
it
should
always
be
remembered
that
is
not
an
unrelated
expression
of
modern
civilization
its
roots
strike
deep
into
the
social
fabric
modern
studies
indicate
that
insanity
epilepsy
criminality
prostitution
pauperism
and
mental
defect
are
all
organically
bound
up
together
and
that
the
least
intelligent
and
the
thoroughly
degenerate
classes
in
every
community
are
the
most
prolific
in
one
generation
becomes
pauperism
or
insanity
in
the
next
there
is
every
indication
that
in
its
protean
forms
is
on
the
increase
that
it
has
leaped
the
barriers
and
that
there
is
truly
as
some
of
the
scientific
eugenists
have
pointed
out
a
peril
to
future
generations
unless
the
are
prevented
from
reproducing
their
kind
to
meet
this
emergency
is
the
immediate
and
peremptory
duty
of
every
state
and
of
all
communities
the
curious
situation
has
come
about
that
while
our
statesmen
are
busy
upon
their
propaganda
of
repopulation
and
are
encouraging
the
production
of
large
families
they
are
ignoring
the
exigent
problem
of
the
elimination
of
the
in
this
however
the
politicians
are
at
one
with
the
traditions
of
a
civilization
which
with
its
charities
and
philanthropies
has
propped
up
the
defective
and
degenerate
and
relieved
them
of
the
burdens
borne
by
the
healthy
sections
of
the
community
thus
enabling
them
more
easily
and
more
numerously
to
propagate
their
kind
with
the
very
highest
motives
declares
walter
fernald
modern
philanthropic
efforts
often
tend
to
foster
and
increase
the
growth
of
defect
in
the
community
the
only
persons
who
now
receive
any
official
consideration
are
those
who
have
already
become
dependent
or
delinquent
many
of
whom
have
already
become
parents
we

now

state
commissions
for
controlling
the

the
boll

and
for
protecting
the
and
wild
game
but
we
have
no
commission
which
even
attempts
to
modify
or
to
control
the
vast
moral
and
economic
forces
represented
by
the
persons
at
large
in
the

how
the

their

numerous

run
the

sir
james
speaks
of
the
great
numbers
of
girls
wholly
unfit
to
become
mothers
who
return
to
the
year
after
year
to
bear
children
many
of
whom
happily
die
but
some
of
whom
survive
to
recruit
our
idiot
establishments
and
to
repeat
their
performances
tredgold
points
out
that
the
number
of
children
born
to
the
is
abnormally
high
women
constitute
a
permanent
menace
to
the
race
and
one
which
becomes
serious
at
a
time
when
the
decline
of
the
is
unmistakable
tredgold
points
out
that
the
average
number
of
children
born
in
a
family
is
four
whereas
in
these
degenerate
families
we
find
an
average
of
to
each
out
of
this
total
only
a
little
more
than
out
of
a
total
of
children
can
be
considered
profitable
members
of
the
community
and
that
be
it
remembered
at
the
parents
valuation
another
significant
point
is
the
number
of
mentally
defective
children
who
survive
out
of
the
total
number
of
mentally
affected
persons
in
the
families
there
are
in
the
present
generation
an
unusually
large
survival
speaking
for
bradford
england
helen
campbell
touches
another
significant
and
interesting
point
usually
neglected
by
the
advocates
of
mothers
pensions
and
programs
we
are
also
confronted
with
the
problem
of
the
actually
mentally
deficient
of
the
more
or
less
and
the
deranged
epileptic
or
otherwise
mentally
abnormal
mother
writes
this
authority
the
mothering
of
these
cases
is
quite
unimprovable
at
an
infant
welfare
center
and
a
very
definite
if
not
relatively
very
large
percentage
of
our
infants
are
suffering
severely
as
a
result
of
dependence
upon
such
thus
we
are
brought
face
to
face
with
another
problem
of
infant
mortality
are
we
to
check
the
infant
mortality
rate
among
the
and
aid
the
unfortunate
offspring
to
grow
up
a
menace
to
the
civilized
community
even
when
not
actually
certifiable
as
mentally
defective
or
not
obviously
imbecile
other
figures
and
studies
indicate
the
close
relationship
between
and
the
spread
of
venereal
scourges
we
are
informed
that
in
michigan
per
cent
of
the
prostitute
class
is
infected
with
some
form
of
venereal
disease
and
that
per
cent
of
the
infected
are
mentally
defective
morons
imbeciles
or
cases
most
dangerous
to
the
community
at
large
at
least
per
cent
of
the
inmates
of
our
prisons
according
to
fernald
are
mentally
defective
and
belong
either
to
the
or
to
the
class
nearly
per
cent
of
the
girls
sent
to
reformatories
are
mental
defectives
society
treats
or
defective
delinquent
men
or
women
as
criminals
sentences
them
to
prison
or
reformatory
for
a
term
and
then
releases
them
at
the
expiration
of
their
sentences
they
are
usually
at
liberty
just
long
enough
to
reproduce
their
kind
and
then
they
return
again
and
again
to
prison
the
truth
of
this
statement
is
evident
from
the
extremely
large
proportion
in
institutions
of
neglected
and
dependent
children
who
are
the
offspring
of
such
parents
confronted
with
these
shocking
truths
about
the
menace
of
to
the
race
a
menace
acute
because
of
the
unceasing
and
unrestrained
fertility
of
such
defectives
we
are
apt
to
become
the
victims
of
a
wild
panic
for
instant
action
there
is
no
occasion
for
hysterical
action
specialists
tell
us
they
direct
our
attention
to
another
phase
of
the
problem
that
of
the
good
we
are
informed
that
imbecility
in
itself
is
not
synonymous
with
badness
if
it
is
fostered
in
a
suitable
environment
it
may
express
itself
in
terms
of
good
citizenship
and
useful
occupation
it
may
thus
be
transmuted
into
a
docile
tractable
and
peaceable
element
of
the
community
the
moron
and
the
thus
protected
so
we
are
assured
may
even
marry
some
brighter
member
of
the
community
and
thus
lessen
the
chances
of
procreating
another
generation
of
imbeciles
we
read
further
that
some
of
our
doctors
believe
that
in
our
social
scale
there
is
a
place
for
the
good
in
such
a
reckless
and
thoughtless
differentiation
between
the
bad
and
the
good
we
find
new
evidence
of
the
conventional
bias
that
also
finds
expression
among
some
of
the
eugenists
we
do
not
object
to
simply
because
it
leads
to
immorality
and
criminality
nor
can
we
approve
of
it
when
it
expresses
itself
in
docility
submissiveness
and
obedience
we
object
because
both
are
burdens
and
dangers
to
the
intelligence
of
the
community
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
lead
us
to
believe
that
the
borderline
cases
are
a
greater
menace
than
the
defective
delinquents
who
can
be
supervised
controlled
and
prevented
from
procreating
their
kind
the
advent
of
the
and
similar
psychological
tests
indicates
that
the
mental
defective
who
is
glib
and
plausible
bright
looking
and
attractive
but
with
a
mental
vision
of
seven
eight
or
nine
years
may
not
merely
lower
the
whole
level
of
intelligence
in
a
school
or
in
a
society
but
may
be
encouraged
by
church
and
state
to
increase
and
multiply
until
he
dominates
and
gives
the
prevailing
color
culturally
speaking
to
an
entire
community
the
presence
in
the
public
schools
of
the
mentally
defective
children
of
men
and
women
who
should
never
have
been
parents
is
a
problem
that
is
becoming
more
and
more
difficult
and
is
one
of
the
chief
reasons
for
lower
educational
standards
as
one
of
the
greatest
living
authorities
on
the
subject
tredgold
has
pointed
out
this
has
created
a
destructive
conflict
of
purpose
in
the
case
of
children
with
a
low
intellectual
capacity
much
of
the
education
at
present
provided
is
for
all
practical
purposes
a
complete
waste
of
time
money
and
patience
on
the
other
hand
for
children
of
high
intellectual
capacity
our
present
system
does
not
go
far
enough
i
believe
that
much
innate
potentiality
remains
undeveloped
even
amongst
the
working
classes
owing
to
the
absence
of
opportunity
for
higher
education
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
nation
in
consequence
of
these
fundamental
differences
the
catchword
of
opportunity
is
meaningless
and
mere
claptrap
in
the
absence
of
any
equality
to
respond
to
such
opportunity
what
is
wanted
is
not
equality
of
opportunity
but
education
adapted
to
individual
potentiality
and
if
the
time
and
money
now
spent
in
the
fruitless
attempt
to
make
out
of
ears
were
devoted
to
the
higher
education
of
children
of
good
natural
capacity
it
would
contribute
enormously
to
national
efficiency
in
a
much
more
complex
manner
than
has
been
recognized
even
by
students
of
this
problem
the
destiny
and
the
progress
of
civilization
and
of
human
expression
has
been
hindered
and
held
back
by
this
burden
of
the
imbecile
and
the
moron
while
we
may
admire
the
patience
and
the
deep
human
sympathy
with
which
the
great
specialists
in
have
expressed
the
hope
of
drying
up
the
sources
of
this
evil
or
of
rendering
it
harmless
we
should
not
permit
sympathy
or
sentimentality
to
blind
us
to
the
fact
that
health
and
vitality
and
human
growth
likewise
need
cultivation
a
laisser
faire
policy
writes
one
investigator
simply
allows
the
social
sore
to
spread
and
a
quasi
laisser
faire
policy
wherein
we
allow
the
defective
to
commit
crime
and
then
interfere
and
imprison
him
wherein
we
grant
the
defective
the
personal
liberty
to
do
as
he
pleases
until
he
pleases
to
descend
to
a
plane
of
living
below
the
animal
level
and
try
to
care
for
a
few
of
his
descendants
who
are
so
helpless
that
they
can
no
longer
exercise
that
personal
liberty
to
do
as
they
please
such
a
policy
increases
and
multiplies
the
dangers
of
the
the
mental
survey
of
the
state
of
oregon
recently
published
by
the
united
states
health
service
sets
an
excellent
example
and
should
be
followed
by
every
state
in
the
union
and
every
civilized
country
as
well
it
is
greatly
to
the
credit
of
the
western
state
that
it
is
one
of
the
first
officially
to
recognize
the
primary
importance
of
this
problem
and
to
realize
that
facts
no
matter
how
fatal
to
must
be
faced
this
survey
authorized
by
the
state
legislature
and
carried
out
by
the
university
of
oregon
in
collaboration
with
carlisle
of
the
public
health
service
aided
by
a
large
number
of
volunteers
shows
that
only
a
small
percentage
of
mental
defectives
and
morons
are
in
the
care
of
institutions
the
rest
are
widely
scattered
and
their
condition
unknown
or
neglected
they
are
docile
and
submissive
they
do
not
attract
attention
to
themselves
as
do
the
criminal
delinquents
and
the
insane
nevertheless
it
is
estimated
that
they
number
no
less
than
men
women
and
children
out
of
a
total
population
of
or
about
ten
per
cent
oregon
it
is
thought
is
no
exception
to
other
states
yet
under
our
present
conditions
these
people
are
actually
encouraged
to
increase
and
multiply
and
replenish
the
earth
concerning
the
importance
of
the
oregon
survey
we
may
quote
surgeon
general
cumming
the
prevention
and
correction
of
mental
defectives
is
one
of
the
great
public
health
problems
of
it
enters
into
many
phases
of
our
work
and
its
influence
continually
crops
up
unexpectedly
for
instance
work
of
the
public
health
service
in
connection
with
juvenile
courts
shows
that
a
marked
proportion
of
juvenile
delinquency
is
traceable
to
some
degree
of
mental
deficiency
in
the
offender
for
years
public
health
officials
have
concerned
themselves
only
with
the
disorders
of
physical
health
but
now
they
are
realizing
the
significance
of
mental
health
also
the
work
in
oregon
constitutes
the
first
survey
which
even
begins
to
disclose
the
enormous
drain
on
a
state
caused
by
mental
defects
one
of
the
objects
of
the
work
was
to
obtain
for
the
people
of
oregon
an
idea
of
the
problem
that
confronted
them
and
the
heavy
annual
loss
both
economic
and
industrial
that
it
entailed
another
was
to
enable
the
legislators
to
devise
a
program
that
would
stop
much
of
the
loss
restore
to
health
and
bring
to
lives
of
industrial
usefulness
many
of
those
now
down
and
out
and
above
all
to
save
hundreds
of
children
from
growing
up
to
lives
of
misery
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
many
of
our
state
legislatures
have
the
intelligence
and
the
courage
to
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
oregon
in
this
respect
nothing
could
more
effectually
stimulate
discussion
and
awaken
intelligence
as
to
the
extravagance
and
cost
to
the
community
of
our
present
codes
of
traditional
morality
but
we
should
make
sure
in
all
such
surveys
that
mental
defect
is
not
concealed
even
in
such
dignified
bodies
as
state
legislatures
and
among
those
leaders
who
are
urging
men
and
women
to
reckless
and
irresponsible
procreation
i
have
touched
upon
these
various
aspects
of
the
complex
problem
of
the
and
the
menace
of
the
moron
to
human
society
not
merely
for
the
purpose
of
reiterating
that
it
is
one
of
the
greatest
and
most
difficult
social
problems
of
modern
times
demanding
an
immediate
stern
and
definite
policy
but
because
it
illustrates
the
actual
harvest
of
reliance
upon
traditional
morality
upon
the
biblical
injunction
to
increase
and
multiply
a
policy
still
taught
by
politician
priest
and
militarist
motherhood
has
been
held
universally
sacred
yet
as
bouchacourt
pointed
out
the
dregs
of
the
human
species
the
blind
the
the
degenerate
the
nervous
the
vicious
the
idiotic
the
imbecile
the
cretins
and
the
epileptics
are
better
protected
than
pregnant
women
the
syphilitic
the
irresponsible
the
are
encouraged
to
breed
unhindered
while
all
the
powerful
forces
of
tradition
of
custom
or
prejudice
have
bolstered
up
the
desperate
effort
to
block
the
inevitable
influence
of
true
civilization
in
spreading
the
principles
of
independence
discrimination
and
foresight
upon
which
the
great
practice
of
intelligent
parenthood
is
based
we
are
confronted
by
the
results
of
this
official
policy
there
is
no
escaping
it
there
is
no
explaining
it
away
surely
it
is
an
amazing
and
discouraging
phenomenon
that
the
very
governments
that
have
seen
fit
to
interfere
in
practically
every
phase
of
the
normal
life
dare
not
attempt
to
restrain
either
by
force
or
persuasion
the
moron
and
the
imbecile
from
producing
his
large
family
of
offspring
in
my
own
experience
i
recall
vividly
the
case
of
a
girl
who
every
year
for
a
long
period
received
the
expert
attention
of
a
great
specialist
in
one
of
the
maternity
hospitals
of
new
york
city
the
great
obstetrician
for
the
benefit
of
interns
and
medical
students
performed
each
year
a
caesarian
operation
upon
this
unfortunate
creature
to
bring
into
the
world
her
defective
and
in
one
case
at
least
her
syphilitic
infant
nelly
was
then
sent
to
a
special
room
and
placed
under
the
care
of
a
day
nurse
and
a
night
nurse
with
extra
and
special
nourishment
provided
each
year
she
returned
to
the
hospital
such
cases
are
not
exceptions
any
experienced
doctor
or
nurse
can
recount
similar
stories
in
the
interest
of
medical
science
this
practice
may
be
justified
i
am
not
criticising
it
from
that
point
of
view
i
realize
as
well
as
the
most
conservative
moralist
that
humanity
requires
that
healthy
members
of
the
race
should
make
certain
sacrifices
to
preserve
from
death
those
unfortunates
who
are
born
with
hereditary
taints
but
there
is
a
point
at
which
philanthropy
may
become
positively
dysgenic
when
charity
is
converted
into
injustice
to
the
citizen
into
positive
injury
to
the
future
of
the
race
such
a
point
it
seems
obvious
is
reached
when
the
incurably
defective
are
permitted
to
procreate
and
thus
increase
their
numbers
the
problem
of
the
dependent
delinquent
and
defective
elements
in
modern
society
we
must
repeat
can
not
be
minimized
because
of
their
alleged
small
numerical
proportion
to
the
rest
of
the
population
the
proportion
seems
small
only
because
we
accustom
ourselves
to
the
habit
of
looking
upon
as
a
separate
and
distinct
calamity
to
the
race
as
a
chance
phenomenon
unrelated
to
the
sexual
and
biological
customs
not
only
condoned
but
even
encouraged
by
our
civilization
the
actual
dangers
can
only
be
fully
realized
when
we
have
acquired
definite
information
concerning
the
financial
and
cultural
cost
of
these
classes
to
the
community
when
we
become
fully
cognizant
of
the
burden
of
the
imbecile
upon
the
whole
human
race
when
we
see
the
funds
that
should
be
available
for
human
development
for
scientific
artistic
and
philosophic
research
being
diverted
annually
by
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
to
the
care
and
segregation
of
men
women
and
children
who
never
should
have
been
born
the
advocate
of
birth
control
realizes
as
well
as
all
intelligent
thinkers
the
dangers
of
interfering
with
personal
liberty
our
whole
philosophy
is
in
fact
based
upon
the
fundamental
assumption
that
man
is
a
creature
that
he
should
not
be
treated
as
a
domestic
animal
that
he
must
be
left
free
at
least
within
certain
wide
limits
to
follow
his
own
wishes
in
the
matter
of
mating
and
in
the
procreation
of
children
nor
do
we
believe
that
the
community
could
or
should
send
to
the
lethal
chamber
the
defective
progeny
resulting
from
irresponsible
and
unintelligent
breeding
but
modern
society
which
has
respected
the
personal
liberty
of
the
individual
only
in
regard
to
the
unrestricted
and
irresponsible
bringing
into
the
world
of
filth
and
poverty
an
overcrowding
procession
of
infants
foredoomed
to
death
or
hereditable
disease
is
now
confronted
with
the
problem
of
protecting
itself
and
its
future
generations
against
the
inevitable
consequences
of
this
policy
of
the
emergency
problem
of
segregation
and
sterilization
must
be
faced
immediately
every
girl
or
woman
of
the
hereditary
type
especially
of
the
moron
class
should
be
segregated
during
the
reproductive
period
otherwise
she
is
almost
certain
to
bear
imbecile
children
who
in
turn
are
just
as
certain
to
breed
other
defectives
the
male
defectives
are
no
less
dangerous
segregation
carried
out
for
one
or
two
generations
would
give
us
only
partial
control
of
the
problem
moreover
when
we
realize
that
each
person
is
a
potential
source
of
an
endless
progeny
of
defect
we
prefer
the
policy
of
immediate
sterilization
of
making
sure
that
parenthood
is
absolutely
prohibited
to
the
this
i
say
is
an
emergency
measure
but
how
are
we
to
prevent
the
repetition
in
the
future
of
a
new
harvest
of
imbecility
the
recurrence
of
new
generations
of
morons
and
defectives
as
the
logical
and
inevitable
consequence
of
the
universal
application
of
the
traditional
and
widely
approved
command
to
increase
and
multiply
at
the
present
moment
we
are
offered
three
distinct
and
more
or
less
mutually
exclusive
policies
by
which
civilization
may
hope
to
protect
itself
and
the
generations
of
the
future
from
the
allied
dangers
of
imbecility
defect
and
delinquency
no
one
can
understand
the
necessity
for
birth
control
education
without
a
complete
comprehension
of
the
dangers
the
inadequacies
or
the
limitations
of
the
present
attempts
at
control
or
the
proposed
programs
for
social
reconstruction
and
racial
regeneration
it
is
therefore
necessary
to
interpret
and
criticize
the
three
programs
offered
to
meet
our
emergency
these
may
be
briefly
summarized
as
follows
philanthropy
and
charity
this
is
the
present
and
traditional
method
of
meeting
the
problems
of
human
defect
and
dependence
of
poverty
and
delinquency
it
is
emotional
altruistic
at
best
ameliorative
aiming
to
meet
the
individual
situation
as
it
arises
and
presents
itself
its
effect
in
practise
is
seldom
if
ever
truly
preventive
concerned
with
symptoms
with
the
allaying
of
acute
and
catastrophic
miseries
it
can
not
if
it
would
strike
at
the
radical
causes
of
social
misery
at
its
worst
it
is
sentimental
and
paternalistic
marxian
socialism
this
may
be
considered
typical
of
many
widely
varying
schemes
of
more
or
less
revolutionary
social
reconstruction
emphasizing
the
primary
importance
of
environment
education
equal
opportunity
and
health
in
the
elimination
of
the
conditions
capitalistic
control
of
industry
which
have
resulted
in
biological
chaos
and
human
waste
i
shall
attempt
to
show
that
the
marxian
doctrine
is
both
too
limited
too
superficial
and
too
fragmentary
in
its
basic
analysis
of
human
nature
and
in
its
program
of
revolutionary
reconstruction
eugenics
eugenics
seems
to
me
to
be
valuable
in
its
critical
and
diagnostic
aspects
in
emphasizing
the
danger
of
irresponsible
and
uncontrolled
fertility
of
the
unfit
and
the
establishing
a
progressive
unbalance
in
human
society
and
lowering
the
among
the
fit
but
in
its
constructive
aspect
in
seeking
to
reestablish
the
dominance
of
healthy
strain
over
the
unhealthy
by
urging
an
increased
among
the
fit
the
eugenists
really
offer
nothing
more
farsighted
than
a
cradle
competition
between
the
fit
and
the
unfit
they
suggest
in
very
truth
that
all
intelligent
and
respectable
parents
should
take

their
example

the

has
witnessed
the
rise
and
development
of
philanthropy
and
organized
charity
coincident
with
the
power
of
machinery
and
capitalistic
control
with
the
unprecedented
growth
of
great
cities
and
industrial
centers
and
the
creation
of
great
proletarian
populations
modern
civilization
has
been
confronted
to
a
degree
hitherto
unknown
in
human
history
with
the
complex
problem
of
sustaining
human
life
in
surroundings
and
under
conditions
flagrantly
dysgenic
the
program
as
i
believe
all
competent
authorities
in
contemporary
philanthropy
and
organized
charity
would
agree
has
been
altered
in
aim
and
purpose
it
was
first
the
outgrowth
of
humanitarian
and
altruistic
idealism
perhaps
not
devoid
of
a
strain
of
sentimentalism
of
an
idealism
that
was
aroused
by
a
desperate
picture
of
human
misery
intensified
by
the
industrial
revolution
it
has
developed
in
later
years
into
a
program
not
so
much
aiming
to
succor
the
unfortunate
victims
of
circumstances
as
to
effect
what
we
may
term
social
sanitation
primarily
it
is
a
program
of
contemporary
philanthropy
i
believe
recognizes
that
extreme
poverty
and
overcrowded
slums
are
veritable
of
epidemics
disease
delinquency
and
dependency
its
aim
therefore
is
to
prevent
the
individual
family
from
sinking
to
that
abject
condition
in
which
it
will
become
a
much
heavier
burden
upon
society
there
is
no
need
here
to
criticize
the
obvious
limitations
of
organized
charities
in
meeting
the
desperate
problem
of
destitution
we
are
all
familiar
with
these
criticisms
the
common
indictment
of
inefficiency
so
often
brought
against
public
and
privately
endowed
agencies
the
charges
include
the
high
cost
of
administration
the
pauperization
of
deserving
poor
and
the
encouragement
and
fostering
of
the
undeserving
the
progressive
destruction
of
and
by
the
paternalistic
interference
of
social
agencies
the
impossibility
of
keeping
pace
with
the
multiplication
of
factors
and
influences
responsible
for
the
perpetuation
of
human
misery
the
misdirection
and
misappropriation
of
endowments
the
absence
of
interorganization
and
coordination
of
the
various
agencies
of
church
state
and
privately
endowed
institutions
the
crimes
of
charity
that
are
occasionally
exposed
in
newspaper
scandals
these
and
similar
strictures
we
may
ignore
as
irrelevant
to
our
present
purpose
as
inevitable
but
not
incurable
faults
that
have
been
and
are
being
eliminated
in
the
slow
but
certain
growth
of
a
beneficent
power
in
modern
civilization
in
reply
to
such
criticisms
the
protagonist
of
modern
philanthropy
might
justly
point
to
the
honest
and
sincere
workers
and
disinterested
scientists
it
has
mobilized
to
the
and
executives
who
have
awakened
public
attention
to
the
evils
of
poverty
and
the
menace
to
the
race
engendered
by
misery
and
filth
even
if
we
accept
organized
charity
at
its
own
valuation
and
grant
that
it
does
the
best
it
can
it
is
exposed
to
a
more
profound
criticism
it
reveals
a
fundamental
and
irremediable
defect
its
very
success
its
very
efficiency
its
very
necessity
to
the
social
order
are
themselves
the
most
unanswerable
indictment
organized
charity
itself
is
the
symptom
of
a
malignant
social
disease
those
vast
complex
interrelated
organizations
aiming
to
control
and
to
diminish
the
spread
of
misery
and
destitution
and
all
the
menacing
evils
that
spring
out
of
this
sinisterly
fertile
soil
are
the
surest
sign
that
our
civilization
has
bred
is
breeding
and
is
perpetuating
constantly
increasing
numbers
of
defectives
delinquents
and
dependents
my
criticism
therefore
is
not
directed
at
the
failure
of
philanthropy
but
rather
at
its
success
these
dangers
inherent
in
the
very
idea
of
humanitarianism
and
altruism
dangers
which
have
produced
their
full
harvest
of
human
waste
of
inequality
and
inefficiency
were
fully
recognized
in
the
last
century
at
the
moment
when
such
ideas
were
first
put
into
practice
readers
of
huxley
attack
on
the
salvation
army
will
recall
his
penetrating
and
stimulating
condemnation
of
the
debauch
of
sentimentalism
which
expressed
itself
in
so
uncontrolled
a
fashion
in
the
victorian
era
one
of
the
most
penetrating
of
american
thinkers
henry
james
sixty
or
seventy
years
ago
wrote
i
have
been
so
long
accustomed
to
see
the
most
arrant
deviltry
transact
itself
in
the
name
of
benevolence
that
the
moment
i
hear
a
profession
of
good
will
from
almost
any
quarter
i
instinctively
look
around
for
a
constable
or
place
my
hand
within
reach
of
a
my
ideal
of
human
intercourse
would
be
a
state
of
things
in
which
no
man
will
ever
stand
in
need
of
any
other
man
help
but
will
derive
all
his
satisfaction
from
the
great
social
tides
which
own
no
individual
names
i
am
sure
no
man
can
be
put
in
a
position
of
dependence
upon
another
without
the
other
very
soon
becoming
if
he
accepts
the
duties
of
the
relation
utterly
degraded
out
of
his
just
human
proportions
no
man
can
play
the
deity
to
his
fellow
man
with
impunity
i
mean
spiritual
impunity
of
course
for
see
if
i
am
at
all
satisfied
with
that
relation
if
it
contents
me
to
be
in
a
position
of
generosity
towards
others
i
must
be
remarkably
indifferent
at
bottom
to
the
gross
social
inequality
which
permits
that
position
and
instead
of
resenting
the
enforced
humiliation
of
my
fellow
man
to
myself
in
the
interests
of
humanity
i
acquiesce
in
it
for
the
sake
of
the
profit
it
yields
to
my
own
i
do
hope
the
reign
of
benevolence
is
over
until
that
event
occurs
i
am
sure
the
reign
of
god
will
be
impossible
we
may
measure
the
evil
effects
of
benevolence
of
this
type
not
merely
upon
those
who
have
indulged
in
it
but
upon
the
community
at
large
these
effects
have
been
reduced
to
statistics
and
we
can
not
if
we
would
escape
their
significance
look
for
instance
since
they
are
close
at
hand
and
fairly
representative
of
conditions
elsewhere
at
the
total
annual
expenditures
of
public
and
private
charities
and
corrections
for
the
state
of
new
york
for
the
year
ending
june
the
expenditures
of
public
institutions
and
agencies
amounted
to
the
expenditures
of
privately
supported
and
endowed
institutions
for
the
same
year
amount
to
this
makes
a
total
for
public
and
private
charities
and
corrections
of
a
conservative
estimate
of
the
increase
for
the
year
brings
this
figure
approximately
to
and
millions
these
figures
take
on
an
eloquent
significance
if
we
compare
them
to
the
comparatively
small
amounts
spent
upon
education
conservation
of
health
and
other
constructive
efforts
thus
while
the
city
of
new
york
spent
per
capita
on
public
education
in
the
year
it
spent
on
public
charities
no
less
than
add
to
this
last
figure
an
even
larger
amount
dispensed
by
private
agencies
and
we
may
derive
some
definite
sense
of
the
heavy
burden
of
dependency
pauperism
and
delinquency
upon
the
normal
and
healthy
sections
of
the
community
statistics
now
available
also
inform
us
that
more
than
a
million
dollars
are
spent
annually
to
support
the
public
and
private
institutions
in
the
state
of
new
york
for
the
segregation
of
the
and
the
epileptic
a
million
and
a
half
is
spent
for
the
of
state
prisons
those
homes
of
the
defective
delinquent
insanity
which
we
should
remember
is
to
a
great
extent
hereditary
annually
drains
from
the
state
treasury
no
less
than
and
from
private
sources
and
endowments
another
twenty
millions
when
we
learn
further
that
the
total
number
of
inmates
in
public
and
private
institutions
in
the
state
of
new
york
in
reformatories
schools
for
the
blind
deaf
and
mute

insane
asylums
in

for
the

amounts
practically
to
less
than
thousand
an
insignificant
number
compared
to
the
total
population
our
eyes
should
be
opened
to
the
terrific
cost
to
the
community
of
this
dead
weight
of
human
waste
the
united
states
public
health
survey
of
the
state
of
oregon
recently
published
shows
that
even
a
young
community
rich
in
natural
resources
and
unusually
progressive
in
legislative
measures
is
no
less
subject
to
this
burden
out
of
a
total
population
of
it
is
estimated
that
more
than
men
women
and
children
are
dependents
or
delinquents
thus
about
per
cent
of
the
population
is
a
constant
drain
on
the
finances
health
and
future
of
that
community
these
figures
represent
a
more
definite
and
precise
survey
than
the
rough
one
indicated
by
the
statistics
of
charities
and
correction
for
the
state
of
new
york
the
figures
yielded
by
this
oregon
survey
are
also
considerably
lower
than
the
average
shown
by
the
draft
examination
a
fact
which
indicates
that
they
are
not
higher
than
might
be
obtained
from
other
states
organized
charity
is
thus
confronted
with
the
problem
of
and
mental
defect
but
just
as
the
state
has
so
far
neglected
the
problem
of
mental
defect
until
this
takes
the
form
of
criminal
delinquency
so
the
tendency
of
our
philanthropic
and
charitable
agencies
has
been
to
pay
no
attention
to
the
problem
until
it
has
expressed
itself
in
terms
of
pauperism
and
delinquency
such
benevolence
is
not
merely
ineffectual
it
is
positively
injurious
to
the
community
and
the
future
of
the
race
but
there
is
a
special
type
of
philanthropy
or
benevolence
now
widely
advertised
and
advocated
both
as
a
federal
program
and
as
worthy
of
private
endowment
which
strikes
me
as
being
more
insidiously
injurious
than
any
other
this
concerns
itself
directly
with
the
function
of
maternity
and
aims
to
supply
gratis
medical
and
nursing
facilities
to
slum
mothers
such
women
are
to
be
visited
by
nurses
and
to
receive
instruction
in
the
hygiene
of
pregnancy
to
be
guided
in
making
arrangements
for
confinements
to
be
invited
to
come
to
the
clinics
for
examination
and
supervision
they
are
we
are
informed
to
receive
adequate
care
during
pregnancy
at
confinement
and
for
one
month
afterward
thus
are
mothers
and
babies
to
be
saved
childbearing
is
to
be
made
safe
the
work
of
the
maternity
centers
in
the
various
american
cities
in
which
they
have
already
been
established
and
in
which
they
are
supported
by
private
contributions
and
endowment
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
point
out
is
carried
on
among
the
poor
and
more
docile
sections
of
the
city
among
mothers
least
able
through
poverty
and
ignorance
to
afford
the
care
and
attention
necessary
for
successful
maternity
now
as
the
findings
of
tredgold
and
karl
pearson
and
the
british
eugenists
so
conclusively
show
and
as
the
infant
mortality
reports
so
thoroughly
substantiate
a
high
rate
of
fecundity
is
always
associated
with
the
direst
poverty
irresponsibility
mental
defect
and
other
transmissible
taints
the
effect
of
maternity
endowments
and
maternity
centers
supported
by
private
philanthropy
would
have
perhaps
already
have
had
exactly
the
most
dysgenic
tendency
the
new
government
program
would
facilitate
the
function
of
maternity
among
the
very
classes
in
which
the
absolute
necessity
is
to
discourage
it
such
benevolence
is
not
merely
superficial
and
it
conceals
a
stupid
cruelty
because
it
is
not
courageous
enough
to
face
unpleasant
facts
aside
from
the
question
of
the
unfitness
of
many
women
to
become
mothers
aside
from
the
very
definite
deterioration
in
the
human
stock
that
such
programs
would
inevitably
hasten
we
may
question
its
value
even
to
the
normal
though
unfortunate
mother
for
it
is
never
the
intention
of
such
philanthropy
to
give
the
poor
and
often
undernourished
mother
of
the
slum
the
opportunity
to
make
the
choice
herself
to
decide
whether
she
wishes
time
after
to
time
to
bring
children
into
the
world
it
merely
says
increase
and
multiply
we
are
prepared
to
help
you
do
this
whereas
the
great
majority
of
mothers
realize
the
grave
responsibility
they
face
in
keeping
alive
and
rearing
the
children
they
have
already
brought
into
the
world
the
maternity
center
would
teach
them
how
to
have
more
the
poor
woman
is
taught
how
to
have
her
seventh
child
when
what
she
wants
to
know
is
how
to
avoid
bringing
into
the
world
her
eighth
such
philanthropy
as
dean
inge
has
so
unanswerably
pointed
out
is
kind
only
to
be
cruel
and
unwittingly
promotes
precisely
the
results
most
deprecated
it
encourages
the
healthier
and
more
normal
sections
of
the
world
to
shoulder
the
burden
of
unthinking
and
indiscriminate
fecundity
of
others
which
brings
with
it
as
i
think
the
reader
must
agree
a
dead
weight
of
human
waste
instead
of
decreasing
and
aiming
to
eliminate
the
stocks
that
are
most
detrimental
to
the
future
of
the
race
and
the
world
it
tends
to
render
them
to
a
menacing
degree
dominant
on
the
other
hand
the
program
is
an
indication
of
a
suddenly
awakened
public
recognition
of
the
shocking
conditions
surrounding
pregnancy
maternity
and
infant
welfare
prevailing
at
the
very
heart
of
our
boasted
civilization
so
terrible
so
unbelievable
are
these
conditions
of
degraded
far
below
the
level
of
primitive
and
barbarian
tribes
nay
even
below
the
plane
of
brutes
that
many
people
confronted
with
such
revolting
and
disgraceful
facts
lost
that
calmness
of
vision
and
impartiality
of
judgment
so
necessary
in
any
serious
consideration
of
this
vital
problem
their
hearts
are
touched
they
become
hysterical
they
demand
immediate
action
and
enthusiastically
and
generously
they
support
the
first
superficial
program
that
is
advanced
immediate
action
may
sometimes
be
worse
than
no
action
at
all
the
warm
heart
needs
the
balance
of
the
cool
head
much
harm
has
been
done
in
the
world
by
those
folk
who
have
always
demanded
that
something
be
done
at
once
they
do
not
stop
to
consider
that
the
very
first
thing
to
be
done
is
to
subject
the
whole
situation
to
the
deepest
and
most
rigorous
thinking
as
the
late
walter
bagehot
wrote
in
a
significant
but
too
often
forgotten
passage
the
most
melancholy
of
human
reflections
perhaps
is
that
on
the
whole
it
is
a
question
whether
the
benevolence
of
mankind
does
more
good
or
harm
great
good
no
doubt
philanthropy
does
but
then
it
also
does
great
evil
it
augments
so
much
vice
it
multiplies
so
much
suffering
it
brings
to
life
such
great
populations
to
suffer
and
to
be
vicious
that
it
is
open
to
argument
whether
it
be
or
be
not
an
evil
to
the
world
and
this
is
entirely
because
excellent
people
fancy
they
can
do
much
by
rapid
action
and
that
they
will
most
benefit
the
world
when
they
most
relieve
their
own
feelings
that
as
soon
as
an
evil
is
seen
ought
to
be
done
to
stay
and
prevent
it
one
may
incline
to
hope
that
the
balance
of
good
over
evil
is
in
favor
of
benevolence
one
can
hardly
bear
to
think
that
it
is
not
so
but
anyhow
it
is
certain
that
there
is
a
most
heavy
debt
of
evil
and
that
this
burden
might
almost
all
have
been
spared
us
if
philanthropists
as
well
as
others
had
not
inherited
from
their
barbarous
forefathers
a
wild
passion
for
instant
action
it
is
customary
i
believe
to
defend
philanthropy
and
charity
upon
the
basis
of
the
sanctity
of
human
life
yet
recent
events
in
the
world
reveal
a
curious
contradiction
in
this
respect
human
life
is
held
sacred
as
a
general
christian
principle
until
war
is
declared
when
humanity
indulges
in
a
universal
debauch
of
bloodshed
and
barbarism
inventing
poison
gases
and
every
type
of
diabolic
suggestion
to
facilitate
killing
and
starvation
blockades
are
enforced
to
weaken
and
starve
civilian
populations
women
and
children
this
accomplished
the
pendulum
of
mob
passion
swings
back
to
the
opposite
extreme
and
the
compensatory
emotions
express
themselves
in
hysterical
fashion
philanthropy
and
charity
are
then
unleashed
we
begin
to
hold
human
life
sacred
again
we
try
to
save
the
lives
of
the
people
we
formerly
sought
to
weaken
by
devastation
disease
and
starvation
we
indulge
in
drives
in
campaigns
of
relief
in
a
general
orgy
of
international
charity
we
are
thus
witnessing
the
inauguration
of
a
vast
system
of
international
charity
as
in
our
more
limited
communities
and
cities
where
and
sections
of
the
population
are
forced
to
shoulder
the
burden
of
the
reckless
and
irresponsible
so
in
the
great
world
community
the
more
prosperous
and
incidentally
less
populous
nations
are
asked
to
relieve
and
succor
those
countries
which
are
either
the
victims
of
the
havoc
of
war
of
militaristic
statesmanship
or
of
the
tradition
of
reckless
propagation
and
its
consequent
the
people
of
the
united
states
have
recently
been
called
upon
to
exercise
their
traditional
generosity
not
merely
to
aid
the
european
relief
council
in
its
efforts
to
keep
alive
three
million
five
hundred
thousand
starving
children
in
central
europe
but
in
addition
to
contribute
to
that
enormous
fund
to
save
the
thirty
million
chinese
who
find
themselves
at
the
verge
of
starvation
owing
to
one
of
those
recurrent
famines
which
strike
often
at
that
densely
populated
and
inert
country
where
procreative
recklessness
is
encouraged
as
a
matter
of
duty
the
results
of
this
international
charity
have
not
justified
the
effort
nor
repaid
the
generosity
to
which
it
appealed
in
the
first
place
no
effort
was
made
to
prevent

recurrence
of

of

attempts
to
sweep
back
the
tide
of
miseries
created
by
unrestricted
propagation

the
feeble
broom
of
sentiment
as
one
of
the
most
observant
and
impartial
of
authorities

bland
has
pointed
out
so
long
as
china
maintains
a

is
estimated
at

more
the
only
possible
alternative
to
these

would
be
emigration
and
this
would
have
to
be
on
such
a
scale
as
would
speedily
overrun
and
overfill
the
habitable
globe
neither
humanitarian
schemes
international
charities
nor
philanthropies
can
prevent
widespread
disaster
to
a
people
which
habitually
breeds
up
to
and
beyond
the
maximum
limits
of
its
food
supply
upon
this
point
it
is
interesting
to
add
frank
vanderlip

likewise
pointed
out
the
inefficacy
and
misdirection
of
this
type
of
international
charity
mr
bland
further
points
out
the
problem
presented
is
one
with
which
neither
humanitarian
nor
religious
zeal
can
ever
cope
so
long
as
we
fail
to
recognize
and
attack
the
fundamental
cause
of
these
calamities
as
a
matter
of
sober
fact
the
benevolent
activities
of
our
missionary
societies
to
reduce
the
deathrate
by
the
prevention
of
infanticide
and
the
checking
of
disease
actually
serve
in
the
end
to
aggravate
the
pressure
of
population
upon
its
and
to
increase
the
severity
of
the
inevitably
resultant
catastrophe
what
is
needed
for
the
prevention
or
at
least
the
mitigation
of
these
scourges
is
an
organized
educational
propaganda
directed
first
against
polygamy
and
the
marriage
of
minors
and
the

and
next
toward
such
a
limitation
of

approximate
the
standard
of

and
well
meaning
philanthropists
in

continue
to
praise

encourage

this

enough
i
hope
to
indicate
the
manifold
inadequacies
inherent
in
present
policies
of
philanthropy
and
charity
the
most
serious
charge
that
can
be
brought
against
modern
benevolence
is
that
it
encourages
the
perpetuation
of
defectives
delinquents

dependents
these
are
the

matters

the
first
essential

the
recognition

statement
of
the
factors
involved
now
in
this
complex

which
confronts
us
no

has
been

is
lacking
is
the
recognition
of
that
fundamental
factor
which
reflects
and

these
essential

incomplete
phases
of
the
problem
the
factor
of
reproduction
for
in

affecting
the
welfare
of
a
biological
species
and
particularly
in
all
problems
of
human
welfare
two
fundamental
forces
work
against
each
other
there
is
hunger
as
the
driving
force
of
all
our
economic
industrial

organizations
and
there
is
the
reproductive
impulse
in
continual
conflict
with
our
economic
political
settlements
race
adjustments
and
the
like
official
moralists
statesmen
politicians
philanthropists

display
an
astounding
disregard
of
this
second
disorganizing
factor
they
treat
the
world
of
men
as
if
it
were
purely
a
hunger
world
instead
of
a
world
yet
there
is
no
phase
of
human

no
question
of
politics
economics
or
industry
that
is
not
tied
up
in
almost
equal
measure
with
the
expression
of
both
of
these
primordial
impulses
you

not

by

you

only
at

you
can

the
problem
of

bound
up
together
while
the
gravest
attention
is
paid
to
the
problem
of
hunger
and

is

are

things
as
a
high
birth
rate
infant
mortality
the
dangers
of

or
but
with
few
exceptions
they
can
not

themselves
to
speak
of
birth
control
until
they
shall
have
broken
through
the
traditional
inhibitions
concerning
the
discussion
of

until
they

instinct
and
until

a

survey

humanity
in
the

with
the
vast

that
problem
as

possible
the

the
inadequacy

the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
upset
all
the
grandiloquent
theories
of
the
previous
era
to
meet
the
new
situation
created
by
the
industrial
revolution
arose
the
new
science
of
political
economy
or
economics
old
political
methods
proved
inadequate
to
keep
pace
with
the
problem
presented
by
the
rapid
rise
of
the
new
machine
and
industrial
power
the
machine
era
very
shortly
and
decisively
exploded
the
simple
belief
that
all
men
are
born
free
and
equal
political
power
was
superseded
by
economic
and
industrial
power
to
sustain
their
supremacy
in
the
political
field
governments
and
politicians
allied
themselves
to
the
new
industrial
oligarchy
old
political
theories
and
practices
were
totally
inadequate
to
control
the
new
situation
or
to
meet
the
complex
problems
that
grew
out
of
it
just
as
the
eighteenth
century
saw
the
rise
and
proliferation
of
political
theories
the
nineteenth
witnessed
the
creation
and
development
of
the
science
of
economics
which
aimed
to
perfect
an
instrument
for
the
study
and
analysis
of
an
industrial
society
and
to
offer
a
technique
for
the
solution
of
the
multifold
problems
it
presented
but
at
the
present
moment
as
the
outcome
of
the
machine
era
and
competitive
populations
the
world
has
been
thrown
into
a
new
situation
the
solution
of
which
is
impossible
solely
by
political
or
economic
weapons
the
industrial
revolution
and
the
development
of
machinery
in
europe
and
america
called
into
being
a
new
type
of
machines
were
at
first
termed
devices
in
reality
as
we
now
know
mechanical
inventions
and
discoveries
created
unprecedented
and
increasingly
enormous
demand
for
labor
the
omnipresent
and
still
existing
scandal
of
child
labor
is
ample
evidence
of
this
machine
production
in
its
opening
phases
demanded
large
concentrated
and
exploitable
populations
large
production
and
the
huge
development
of
international
trade
through
improved
methods
of
transport
made
possible
the
maintenance
upon
a
low
level
of
existence
of
these
rapidly
increasing
proletarian
populations
with
the
rise
and
spread
throughout
europe
and
america
of
machine
production
it
is
now
possible
to
correlate
the
expansion
of
the
proletariat
the
bred
almost
automatically
to
meet
the
demand
for
hands
the
rise
in
population
the
multiplication
of
proletarian
populations
as
a
first
result
of
mechanical
industry
the
appearance
of
great
centers
of
population
the
urban
drift
and
the
evils
of
overcrowding
still
remain
insufficiently
studied
and
stated
it
is
a
significant
though
neglected
fact
that
when
after
long
agitation
in
great
britain
child
labor
was
finally
forbidden
by
law
the
supply
of
children
dropped
appreciably
no
longer
of
economic
value
in
the
factory
children
were
evidently
a
drug
in
the
home
yet
it
is
doubly
significant
that
from
this
moment
british
labor
began
the
long
unending
task
of
nineteenth
century
economics
had
no
method
of
studying
the
interrelation
of
the
biological
factors
with
the
industrial
overcrowding
overwork
the
progressive
destruction
of
responsibility
by
the
machine
discipline
as
is
now
perfectly
obvious
had
the
most
disastrous
consequences
upon
human
character
and
human
habits
paternalistic
philanthropies
and
sentimental
charities
which
sprang
up
like
mushrooms
only
tended
to
increase
the
evils
of
indiscriminate
breeding
from
the
physiological
and
psychological
point
of
view
the
factory
system
has
been
nothing
less
than
catastrophic
austin
freeman
has
recently
pointed
out
some
of
the
physiological
psychological
and
racial
effects
of
machinery
upon
the
proletariat
the
breeders
of
the
world
speaking
for
great
britain
freeman
suggests
that
the
omnipresence
of
machinery
tends
toward
the
production
of
large
but
inferior
populations
evidences
of
biological
and
racial
degeneracy
are
apparent
to
this
observer
compared
with
the
african
negro
he
writes
the
british
is
in
several
respects
markedly
inferior
he
tends
to
be
dull
he
is
usually
quite
helpless
and
unhandy
he
has
as
a
rule
no
skill
or
knowledge
of
handicraft
or
indeed
knowledge
of
any
kind
is
a
phenomenon
connected
with
the
survival
of
the
unfit
and
it
is
mechanism
which
has
created
conditions
favorable
to
the
survival
of
the
unfit
and
the
elimination
of
the
fit
the
whole
indictment
against
machinery
is
summarized
by
freeman
mechanism
by
its
reactions
on
man
and
his
environment
is
antagonistic
to
human
welfare
it
has
destroyed
industry
and
replaced
it
by
mere
labor
it
has
degraded
and
vulgarized
the
works
of
man
it
has
destroyed
social
unity
and
replaced
it
by
social
disintegration
and
class
antagonism
to
an
extent
which
directly
threatens
civilization
it
has
injuriously
affected
the
structural
type
of
society
by
developing
its
organization
at
the
expense
of
the
individual
it
has
endowed
the
inferior
man
with
political
power
which
he
employs
to
the
common
disadvantage
by
creating
political
institutions
of
a
socially
destructive
type
and
finally
by
its
reactions
on
the
activities
of
war
it
constitutes
an
agent
for
the
wholesale
physical
destruction
of
man
and
his
works
and
the
extinction
of
human
culture
it
is
not
necessary
to
be
in
absolute
agreement
with
this
diagnostician
to
realize
the
menace
of
machinery
which
tends
to
emphasize
quantity
and
mere
number
at
the
expense
of
quality
and
individuality
one
thing
is
certain
if
machinery
is
detrimental
to
biological
fitness
the
machine
must
be
destroyed
as
it
was
in
samuel
butler
erewhon
but
perhaps
there
is
another
way
of
mastering
this
problem
altruism
humanitarianism
and
philanthropy
have
aided
and
abetted
machinery
in
the
destruction
of
responsibility
and
among
the
least
desirable
elements
of
the
proletariat
in
contrast
with
the
previous
epoch
of
discovery
of
the
new
world
of
exploration
and
colonization
when
a
centrifugal
influence
was
at
work
upon
the
populations
of
europe
the
advent
of
machinery
has
brought
with
it
a
counteracting
centripetal
effect
the
result
has
been
the
accumulation
of
large
urban
populations
the
increase
of
irresponsibility
and
margin
of
biological
waste
just
as
eighteenth
century
politics
and
political
theories
were
unable
to
keep
pace
with
the
economic
and
capitalistic
aggressions
of
the
nineteenth
century
so
also
we
find
if
we
look
closely
enough
that
nineteenth
century
economics
is
inadequate
to
lead
the
world
out
of
the
catastrophic
situation
into
which
it
has
been
thrown
by
the
debacle
of
the
world
war
economists
are
coming
to
recognize
that
the
purely
economic
interpretation
of
contemporary
events
is
insufficient
too
long
as
one
of
them
has
stated
orthodox
economists
have
overlooked
the
important
fact
that
human
life
is
dynamic
that
change
movement
evolution
are
its
basic
characteristics
that
and
therefore
freedom
of
choice
and
movement
are
prerequisites
to
a
satisfying
human
state
economists
themselves
are
breaking
with
the
old
dismal
science
of
the
manchester
school
with
its
sterile
study
of
supply
and
demand
of
prices
and
exchange
of
wealth
and
labor
like
the
chicago
vice
commission
economists
many
of
whom
still
survive
into
our
own
day
considered
sex
merely
as
something
to
be
legislated
out
of
existence
they
had
the
right
idea
that
wealth
consisted
solely
of
material
things
used
to
promote
the
welfare
of
certain
human
beings
their
idea
of
capital
was
somewhat
confused
they
apparently
decided
that
capital
was
merely
that
part
of
capital
used
to
produce
profit
prices
exchanges
commercial
statistics
and
financial
operations
comprised
the
subject
matter
of
these
older
economists
it
would
have
been
considered
unscientific
to
take
into
account
the
human
factors
involved
they
might
study
the
and
depreciation
of
machinery
but
the
depreciation
or
destruction
of
the
human
race
did
not
concern
them
under
wealth
they
never
included
the
vast
wasted
treasury
of
human
life
and
human
expression
economists
are
awake
to
the
imperative
duty
of
dealing
with
the
whole
of
human
nature
with
the
relation
of
men
women
and
children
to
their
environment
physical
and
psychic
as
well
as
social
of
dealing
with
all
those
factors
which
contribute
to
human
sustenance
happiness
and
welfare
the
economist
at
length
investigates
human
motives
economics
outgrows
the
outworn
metaphysical
preconceptions
of
nineteenth
century
theory
we
witness
the
creation
of
a
new
welfare
or
social
economics
based
on
a
fuller
and
more
complete
knowledge
of
the
human
race
upon
a
recognition
of
sex
as
well
as
of
hunger
in
brief
of
physiological
instincts
and
psychological
demands
the
newer
economists
are
beginning
to
recognize
that
their
science
heretofore
failed
to
take
into
account
the
most
vital
factors
in
modern
industry
it
failed
to
foresee
the
inevitable
consequences
of
compulsory
motherhood
the
catastrophic
effects
of
child
labor
upon
racial
health
the
overwhelming
importance
of
national
vitality
and
the
international
ramifications
of
the
population
problem
the
relation
of
indiscriminate
breeding
to
and
industrial
inefficiency
it
speculated
too
little
or
not
at
all
on
human
motives
human
nature
riots
through
the
traditional
economic
structure
as
carlton
parker
pointed
out
with
ridicule
and
destruction
the
economist
looked
on
helpless
and
aghast
inevitably
we
are
driven
to
the
conclusion
that
the
exhaustively
economic
interpretation
of
contemporary
history
is
inadequate
to
meet
the
present
situation
in
his
suggestive
book
the
acquisitive
society
tawney
arrives
at
the
conclusion
that
obsession
by
economic
issues
is
as
local
and
transitory
as
it
is
repulsive
and
disturbing
to
future
generations
it
will
appear
as
pitiable
as
the
obsession
of
the
seventeenth
century
by
religious
quarrels
appears
indeed
it
is
less
rational
since
the
object
with
which
it
is
concerned
is
less
important
and
it
is
a
poison
which
inflames
every
wound
and
turns
each
trivial
scratch
into
a
malignant
ulcer
society
will
not
solve
the
particular
problems
of
industry
until
that
poison
is
expelled
and
it
has
learned
to
see
industry
in
its
proper
perspective
if
it
is
to
do
that
it
must
rearrange
the
scale
of
values
it
must
regard
economic
interests
as
one
element
in
life
not
as
the
whole
of
life
in
neglecting
or
minimizing
the
great
factor
of
sex
in
human
society
the
marxian
doctrine
reveals
itself
as
no
stronger
than
orthodox
economics
in
guiding
our
way
to
a
sound
civilization
it
works
within
the
same
intellectual
limitations
much
as
we
are
indebted
to
the
marxians
for
pointing
out
the
injustice
of
modern
industrialism
we
should
never
close
our
eyes
to
the
obvious
limitations
of
their
own
economic
interpretation
of
history
while
we
must
recognize
the
great
historical
value
of
marx
it
is
now
evident
that
his
vision
of
the
class
struggle
of
the
bitter
irreconcilable
warfare
between
the
capitalist
and
working
classes
was
based
not
upon
historical
analysis
but
upon
on
unconscious
dramatization
of
a
superficial
aspect
of
capitalistic
regime
in
emphasizing
the
conflict
between
the
classes
marx
failed
to
recognize
the
deeper
unity
of
the
proletariat
and
the
capitalist
nineteenth
century
capitalism
had
in
reality
engendered
and
cultivated
the
very
type
of
working
class
best
suited
to
its
own
purpose
an
inert
docile
irresponsible
and
submissive
class
progressively
incapable
of
effective
and
aggressive
organization
like
the
economists
of
the
manchester
school
marx
failed
to
recognize
the
interplay
of
human
instincts
in
the
world
of
industry
all
the
virtues
were
embodied
in
the
beloved
proletariat
all
the
villainies
in
the
capitalists
the
greatest
asset
of
the
capitalism
of
that
age
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
uncontrolled
breeding
among
the
laboring
classes
the
intelligent
and
section
of
the
workers
was
forced
to
bear
the
burden
of
the
unemployed
and
the
marx
was
fully
aware
of
the
consequences
of
this
condition
of
things
but
shut
his
eyes
tightly
to
the
cause
he
pointed
out
that
capitalistic
power
was
dependent
upon
the
reserve
army
of
labor
surplus
labor
and
a
wide
margin
of
unemployment
he
practically
admitted
that
was
the
inevitable
soil
of
predatory
capitalism
but
he
disregarded
the
most
obvious
consequence
of
that
admission
it
was
all
very
dramatic
and
grandiloquent
to
tell
the
workingmen
of
the
world
to
unite
that
they
had
nothing
but
their
chains
to
lose
and
the
world
to
gain
cohesion
of
any
sort
united
and
voluntary
organization
as
events
have
proved
is
impossible
in
populations
bereft
of
intelligence
and
even
the
material
necessities
of
life
and
cheated
by
their
desires
and
ignorance
into
unrestrained
and
uncontrolled
fertility
in
pointing
out
the
limitations
and
fallacies
of
the
orthodox
marxian
opinion
my
purpose
is
not
to
depreciate
the
efforts
of
the
socialists
aiming
to
create
a
new
society
but
rather
to
emphasize
what
seems
to
me
the
greatest
and
most
neglected
truth
of
our
day
unless
sexual
science
is
incorporated
as
an
integral
part
of
and
the
pivotal
importance
of
birth
control
is
recognized
in
any
program
of
reconstruction
all
efforts
to
create
a
new
world
and
a
new
civilization
are
foredoomed
to
failure
we
can
hope
for
no
advance
until
we
attain
a
new
conception
of
sex
not
as
a
merely
propagative
act
not
merely
as
a
biological
necessity
for
the
perpetuation
of
the
race
but
as
a
psychic
and
spiritual
avenue
of
expression
it
is
the
limited
inhibited
conception
of
sex
that
vitiates
so
much
of
the
thought
and
ideation
of
the
eugenists
like
most
of
our
social
idealists
statesmen
politicians
and
economists
some
of
the
eugenists
suffer
intellectually
from
a
restricted
and
inhibited
understanding
of
the
function
of
sex
this
limited
understanding
this
narrowness
of
vision
which
gives
rise
to
most
of
the
misconceptions
and
condemnations
of
the
doctrine
of
birth
control
is
responsible
or
the
failure
of
politicians
and
legislators
to
enact
practical
statutes
or
to
remove
traditional
obscenities
from
the
law
books
the
most
encouraging
sign
at
present
is
the
recognition
by
modern
psychology
of
the
central
importance
of
the
sexual
instinct
in
human
society
and
the
rapid
spread
of
this
new
concept
among
the
more
enlightened
sections
of
the
civilized
communities
the
new
conception
of
sex
has
been
well
stated
by
one
to
whom
the
debt
of
contemporary
civilization
is
immeasurable
sexual
activity
havelock
ellis
has
written
is
not
merely
a
baldly
propagative
act
nor
when
propagation
is
put
aside
is
it
merely
the
relief
of
distended
vessels
it
is
something
more
even
than
the
foundation
of
great
social
institutions
it
is
the
function
by
which
all
the
finer
activities
of
the
organism
physical
and
psychic
may
be
developed
and
satisfied
no
less
than
seventy
years
ago
a
profound
but
neglected
thinker
george
drysdale
emphasized
the
necessity
of
a
thorough
understanding
of
sexual
nature
in
approaching
economic
political
and
social
problems
before
we
can
undertake
the
calm
and
impartial
investigation
of
any
social
problem
we
must
first
of
all
free
ourselves
from
all
those
sexual
prejudices
which
are
so
vehement
and
violent
and
which
so
completely
distort
our
vision
of
the
external
world
society
as
a
whole
has
yet
to
fight
its
way
through
an
almost
impenetrable
forest
of
sexual
taboos
drysdale
words
have
lost
none
of
their
truth
even
there
are
few
things
from
which
humanity
has
suffered
more
than
the
degraded
and
irreverent
feelings
of
mystery
and
shame
that
have
been
attached
to
the
genital
and
excretory
organs
the
former
have
been
regarded
like
their
corresponding
mental
passions
as
something
of
a
lower
and
baser
nature
tending
to
degrade
and
carnalize
man
by
their
physical
appetites
but
we
can
not
take
a
debasing
view
of
any
part
of
our
humanity
without
becoming
degraded
in
our
whole
being
drysdale
moreover
clearly
recognized
the
social
crime
of
entrusting
to
sexual
barbarians
the
duty
of
legislating
and
enforcing
laws
detrimental
to
the
welfare
of
all
future
generations
they
trust
blindly
to
authority
for
the
rules
they
blindly
lay
down
he
wrote
perfectly
unaware
of
the
awful
and
complicated
nature
of
the
subject
they
are
dealing
with
so
confidently
and
of
the
horrible
evils
their
unconsidered
statements
are
attended
with
they
themselves
break
through
the
most
fundamentally
important
laws
daily
in
utter
unconsciousness
of
the
misery
they
are
causing
to
their
fellows
psychologists
courageously
emphasize
the
integral
relationship
of
the
expression
of
the
sexual
instinct
with
every
phase
of
human
activity
until
we
recognize
this
central
fact
we
can
not
understand
the
implications
and
the
sinister
significance
of
superficial
attempts
to
apply
rosewater
remedies
to
social
evils
by
the
enactment
of
restrictive
and
superficial
legislation
by
wholesale
philanthropies
and
charities
by
publicly
burying
our
heads
in
the
sands
of
sentimentality
censors
grossly
immoral
moralists
makeshift
legislators
all
face
a
heavy
responsibility
for
the
miseries
diseases
and
social
evils
they
perpetuate
or
intensify
by
enforcing
the
primitive
taboos
of
aboriginal
customs
traditions
and
outworn
laws
which
at
every
step
hinder
the
education
of
the
people
in

is
revolution
the
remedy
marxian
socialism
which
seeks
to
solve
the
complex
problem
of
human
misery
by
economic
and
proletarian
revolution
has
manifested
a
new
vitality
every
shade
of
socialistic
thought
and
philosophy
acknowledges
its
indebtedness
to
the
vision
of
karl
marx
and
his
conception
of
the
class
struggle
yet
the
relation
of
marxian
socialism
to
the
philosophy
of
birth
control
especially
in
the
minds
of
most
socialists
remains
hazy
and
confused
no
thorough
understanding
of
birth
control
its
aims
and
purposes
is
possible
until
this
confusion
has
been
cleared
away
and
we
come
to
a
realization
that
birth
control
is
not
merely
independent
of
but
even
antagonistic
to
the
marxian
dogma
in
recent
years
many
socialists
have
embraced
the
doctrine
of
birth
control
and
have
generously
promised
us
that
under
socialism
voluntary
motherhood
will
be
adopted
and
popularized
as
part
of
a
general
educational
system
we
might
more
logically
reply
that
no
socialism
will
ever
be
possible
until
the
problem
of
responsible
parenthood
has
been
solved
many
socialists
remain
ignorant
of
the
inherent
conflict
between
the
idea
of
birth
control
and
the
philosophy
of
marx
the
earlier
marxians
including
karl
marx
himself
expressed
the
bitterest
antagonism
to
malthusian
and
theories
a
remarkable
feature
of
early
marxian
propaganda
has
been
the
almost
complete
unanimity
with
which
the
implications
of
the
malthusian
doctrine
have
been
derided
denounced
and
repudiated
any
defense
of
the
law
of
population
was
enough
to
stamp
one
in
the
eyes
of
the
orthodox
marxians
as
a
tool
of
the
capitalistic
class
seeking
to
dampen
the
ardor
of
those
who
expressed
the
belief
that
men
might
create
a
better
world
for
themselves
malthus
they
claimed
was
actuated
by
selfish
class
motives
he
was
not
merely
a
hidebound
aristocrat
but
a
pessimist
who
was
trying
to
kill
all
hope
of
human
progress
by
marx
engels
bebel
karl
kautsky
and
all
the
celebrated
leaders
and
interpreters
of
marx
great
bible
of
the
working
class
down
to
the
martyred
rosa
luxemburg
and
karl
liebknecht
birth
control
has
been
looked
upon
as
a
subtle
machiavellian
sophistry
created
for
the
purpose
of
placing
the
blame
for
human
misery
elsewhere
than
at
the
door
of
the
capitalist
class
upon
this
point
the
orthodox
marxian
mind
has
been
universally
and
sternly
uncompromising
marxian
vituperation
of
malthus
and
his
followers
is
illuminating
it
reveals
not
the
weakness
of
the
thinker
attacked
but
of
the
aggressor
this
is
nowhere
more
evident
than
in
marx
capital
itself
in
that
monumental
effort
it
is
impossible
to
discover
any
adequate
refutation
or
even
calm
discussion
of
the
dangers
of
irresponsible
parenthood
and
reckless
breeding
any
suspicion
that
this
recklessness
and
irresponsibility
is
even
remotely
related
to
the
miseries
of
the
proletariat
poor
malthus
is
there
relegated
to
the
humble
level
of
a
footnote
if
the
reader
reminds
me
of
malthus
whose
essay
on
population
appeared
in
marx
remarks
somewhat
tartly
i
remind
him
that
this
work
in
its
first
form
is
nothing
more
than
a
schoolboyish
superficial
plagiary
of
de
foe
sir
james
steuart
townsend
franklin
wallace
and
does
not
contain
a
single
sentence
thought
out
by
himself
the
great
sensation
this
pamphlet
caused
was
due
solely
to
party
interest
the
french
revolution
had
passionate
defenders
in
the
united
kingdom
principles
of
population
was
quoted
with
jubilance
by
the
english
oligarchy
as
the
great
destroyer
of
all
hankerings
after
human
development
the
only
attempt
that
marx
makes
here
toward
answering
the
theory
of
malthus
is
to
declare
that
most
of
the
population
theory
teachers
were
merely
protestant
parson
wallace
parson
townsend
parson
malthus
and
his
pupil
the
thomas
chalmers
to
say
nothing
of
the
lesser
reverend
scribblers
in
this
line
the
great
pioneer
of
scientific
socialism
then
proceeds
to
berate
parsons
as
philosophers
and
economists
using
this
method
of
escape
from
the
very
pertinent
question
of
surplus
population
and
surplus
proletariat
in
its
relation
to
labor
organization
and
unemployment
it
is
true
that
elsewhere
he
goes
so
far
as
to
admit
that
even
malthus
recognized
as
a
necessity
of
modern
industry
though
after
his
narrow
fashion
he
explains
it
by
the
absolute
of
the
laboring
population
not
by
their
becoming
relatively
supernumerary
a
few
pages
later
however
marx
comes
back
again
to
the
question
of
failing
to
realize
that
it
is
to
the
capitalists
advantage
that
the
working
classes
are
unceasingly
prolific
the
folly
is
now
patent
writes
the
unsuspecting
marx
of
the
economic
wisdom
that
preaches
to
the
laborers
the
accommodation
of
their
numbers
to
the
requirements
of
capital
the
mechanism
of
capitalist
production
and
accumulation
constantly
affects
this
adjustment
the
first
work
of
this
adaptation
is
the
creation
of
a
relatively
surplus
population
or
industrial
reserve
army
its
last
work
is
the
misery
of
constantly
extending
strata
of
the
army
of
labor
and
the
dead
weight
of
pauperism
a
little
later
he
ventures
again
in
the
direction
of
malthusianism
so
far
as
to
admit
that
the
accumulation
of
wealth
at
one
pole
is
at
the
same
time
the
accumulation
of
misery
agony
of
toil
slavery
ignorance
brutality
and
mental
degradation
at
the
opposite
pole
nevertheless
there
is
no
indication
that
marx
permitted
himself
to
see
that
the
proletariat
accommodates
its
numbers
to
the
requirements
of
capital
precisely
by
breeding
a
large
docile
submissive
and
easily
exploitable
population
had
the
purpose
of
marx
been
impartial
and
scientific
this
trifling
difference
might
easily
have
been
overcome
and
the
dangers
of
reckless
breeding
insisted
upon
but
beneath
all
this
wordy
pretension
and
economic
jargon
we
detect
another
aim
that
is
the
unconscious
dramatization
of
human
society
into
the
class
conflict
nothing
was
overlooked
that
might
sharpen
and
accentuate
this
conflict
marx
depicted
a
great
melodramatic
conflict
in
which
all
the
virtues
were
embodied
in
the
proletariat
and
all
the
villainies
in
the
capitalist
in
the
end
as
always
in
such
dramas
virtue
was
to
be
rewarded
and
villainy
punished
the
working
class
was
the
temporary
victim
of
a
subtle
but
thorough
conspiracy
of
tyranny
and
repression
capitalists
intellectuals
and
the
bourgeoisie
were
all
in
on
this
diabolic
conspiracy
all
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
plot
which
marx
was
so
sure
he
had
uncovered
in
the
last
act
was
to
occur
that
catastrophic
revolution
with
the
final
transformation
scene
of
the
socialist
millennium
presented
in
scientific
phraseology
with
all
the
authority
of
economic
terms
capital
appeared
at
the
psychological
moment
the
heaven
of
the
traditional
theology
had
been
shattered
by
darwinian
science
and
here
dressed
up
in
all
the
authority
of
the
new
science
appeared
a
new
theology
the
promise
of
a
new
heaven
an
earthly
paradise
with
an
impressive
scale
of
rewards
for
the
faithful
and
ignominious
punishments
for
the
capitalists
critics
have
often
been
puzzled
by
the
tremendous
vitality
of
this
work
its
predictions
have
never
despite
the
claims
of
the
faithful
been
fulfilled
instead
of
diminishing
the
spirit
of
nationalism
has
been
intensified
tenfold
in
nearly
every
respect
marx
predictions
concerning
the
evolution
of
historical
and
economic
forces
have
been
contradicted
by
events
culminating
in
the
great
war
most
of
his
followers
the
revolutionary
socialists
were
swept
into
the
whirlpool
of
nationalistic
militarism
nevertheless
this
bible
of
the
working
classes
still
enjoys
a
tremendous
authority
as
a
scientific
work
by
some
it
is
regarded
as
an
economic
treatise
by
others
as
a
philosophy
of
history
by
others
as
a
collection
of
sociological
laws
and
finally
by
others
as
a
moral
and
political
book
of
reference
criticized
refuted
repudiated
and
demolished
by
specialists
it
nevertheless
exerts
its
influences
and
retains
its
mysterious
vitality
we
must
seek
the
explanation
of
this
secret
elsewhere
modern
psychology
has
taught
us
that
human
nature
has
a
tendency
to
place
the
cause
of
its
own
deficiencies
and
weaknesses
outside
of
itself
to
attribute
to
some
external
agency
to
some
enemy
or
group
of
enemies
the
blame
for
its
own
misery
in
his
great
work
marx
unconsciously
strengthens
and
encourages
this
tendency
the
immediate
effect
of
his
teaching
vulgarized
and
popularized
in
a
hundred
different
forms
is
to
relieve
the
proletariat
of
all
responsibility
for
the
effects
of
its
reckless
breeding
and
even
to
encourage
it
in
the
perpetuation
of
misery
the
inherent
truth
in
the
marxian
teachings
was
moreover
immediately
subordinated
to
their
emotional
and
religious
appeal
a
book
that
could
so
influence
european
thought
could
not
be
without
merit
but
in
the
process
of
becoming
the
bible
of
the
working
classes
capital
suffered
the
fate
of
all
such
bibles
the
spirit
of
ecclesiastical
dogmatism
was
transfused
into
the
religion
of
revolutionary
socialism
this
dogmatic
religious
quality
has
been
noted
by
many
of
the
most
observant
critics
of
socialism
marx
was
too
readily
accepted
as
the
father
of
the
church
and
capital
as
the
sacred
gospel
of
the
social
revolution
all
questions
of
tactics
of
propaganda
of
class
warfare
of
political
policy
were
to
be
solved
by
apt
quotations
from
the
good
book
new
thoughts
new
schemes
new
programs
based
upon
tested
fact
and
experience
the
outgrowth
of
newer
discoveries
concerning
the
nature
of
men
upon
the
recognition
of
the
mistakes
of
the
master
could
only
be
approved
or
admitted
according
as
they
could
or
could
not
be
tested
by
some
bit
of
text
quoted
from
marx
his
followers
assumed
that
karl
marx
had
completed
the
philosophy
of
socialism
and
that
the
duty
of
the
proletariat
thenceforth
was
not
to
think
for
itself
but
merely
to
mobilize
itself
under
competent
marxian
leaders
for
the
realization
of
his
ideas
from
the
day
of
this
apotheosis
of
marx
until
our
own
the
orthodox
socialist
of
any
shade
is
of
the
belief
that
the
first
essential
for
social
salvation
lies
in
unquestioning
belief
in
the
dogmas
of
marx
the
curious
and
persistent
antagonism
to
birth
control
that
began
with
marx
and
continues
to
our
own
day
can
be
explained
only
as
the
utter
refusal
or
inability
to
consider
humanity
in
its
physiological
and
psychological
aspects
these
aspects
apparently
having
no
place
in
the
economic
interpretation
of
history
it
has
remained
for
george
bernard
shaw
a
socialist
with
a
keener
spiritual
insight
than
the
ordinary
marxist
to
point
out
the
disastrous
consequences
of
rapid
multiplication
which
are
obvious
to
the
small
cultivator
the
peasant
proprietor
the
lowest
farmhand
himself
but
which
seem
to
arouse
the
orthodox
intellectual
marxian
to
inordinate
fury
but
indeed
the
more
you
degrade
the
workers
shaw
once
wrote
robbing
them
of
all
artistic
enjoyment
and
all
chance
of
respect
and
admiration
from
their
fellows
the
more
you
throw
them
back
reckless
upon
the
one
pleasure
and
the
one
human
tie
left
to
them
the
gratification
of
their
instinct
for
producing
fresh
supplies
of
men
you
will
applaud
this
instinct
as
divine
until
at
last
the
excessive
supply
becomes
a
nuisance
there
comes
a
plague
of
men
and
you
suddenly
discover
that
the
instinct
is
diabolic
and
set
up
a
cry
of
but
your
slaves
are
beyond
caring
for
your
cries
they
breed
like
rabbits
and
their
poverty
breeds
filth
ugliness
dishonesty
disease
obscenity
drunkenness
lack
of
insight
into
fundamental
truths
of
human
nature
is
evident
throughout
the
writings
of
the
marxians
the
marxian
socialists
according
to
kautsky
defended
women
in
industry
it
was
right
for
woman
to
work
in
factories
in
order
to
preserve
her
equality
with
man
man
must
not
support
woman
declared
the
great
french
socialist
guesde
because
that
would
make
her
the
proletaire
of
man
bebel
the
great
authority
on
woman
famous
for
his
erudition
having
critically
studied
the
problem
of
population
suggested
as
a
remedy
for
too
excessive
fecundity
the
consumption
of
a
certain
lard
soup
reputed
to
have
an
effect
upon
the
agricultural
population
of
upper
bavaria
such
are
the
results
of
the
literal
and
uncritical
acceptance
of
marx
static
and
mechanical
conception
of
human
society
a
society
perfectly
automatic
in
which
competition
is
always
operating
at
maximum
efficiency
one
vast
and
unending
conspiracy
against
the
blameless
proletariat
this
lack
of
insight
of
the
orthodox
marxians
long
represented
by
the
german
is
nowhere
better
illustrated
than
in
robinson
account
of
a
mass
meeting
of
the
party
to
organize
public
opinion
against
the
doctrine
of
birth
control
among
the
poor
another
meeting
had
taken
place
the
week
before
at
which
several
eminent
socialist
women
among
them
rosa
luxemburg
and
clara
zetkin
spoke
very
strongly
against
limitation
of
offspring
among
the
poor
in
fact
the
title
of
the
discussion
was
gegen
den
geburtstreik
the
birth
strike
the
interest
of
the
audience
was
intense
one
could
see
that
with
them
it
was
not
merely
a
dialectic
question
as
it
was
with
their
leaders
but
a
matter
of
life
and
death
i
came
to
attend
a
meeting
against
the
limitation
of
offspring
it
soon
proved
to
be
a
meeting
very
decidedly
for
the
limitation
of
offspring
for
every
speaker
who
spoke
in
favor
of
the
artificial
prevention
of
conception
or
undesired
pregnancies
was
greeted
with
vociferous
applause
while
those
who
tried
to
persuade
the
people
that
a
limited
number
of
children
is
not
a
proletarian
weapon
and
would
not
improve
their
lot
were
so
hissed
that
they
had
difficulty
going
on
the
speakers
who
were
against
the
idea
soon
felt
that
their
audience
was
against
them
why
was
there
such
small
attendance
at
the
regular
socialistic
meetings
while
the
meetings
of
this
character
were
packed
to
suffocation
it
did
not
apparently
penetrate
the
leaders
heads
that
the
reason
was
a
simple
one
those
meetings
were
evidently
of
no
interest
to
them
while
those
which
dealt
with
the
limitation
of
offspring
were
of
personal
vital
present
interest
what
particularly
amused
me
and
pained
me
in
the
was
the
ease
and
equanimity
with
which
they
advised
the
poor
women
to
keep
on
bearing
children
the
woman
herself
was
not
taken
into
consideration
as
if
she
was
not
a
human
being
but
a
machine
what
are
her
sufferings
her
labor
pains
her
inability
to
read
to
attend
meetings
to
have
a
taste
of
life
what
does
she
amount
to
the
proletariat
needs
fighters
go
on
females
and
breed
like
animals
maybe
of
the
thousands
you
bear

the
militant
organization
of
the
marxian
socialists
suggests
that
their
campaign
must
assume
the
tactics
of
militarism
of
the
familiar
type
as
represented
by
militaristic
governments
militarism
like
socialism
has
always
encouraged
the
proletariat
to
increase
and
multiply
imperial
germany
was
the
outstanding
and
awful
example
of
this
attitude
before
the
war
the
fall
in
the
was
viewed
by
the
junker
party
with
the
gravest
misgivings
bernhardi
and
the
protagonists
of
condemned
it
in
the
strongest
terms
the
marxians
unconsciously
repeat
the
words
of
the
government
representative
krohne
who
in
a
debate
on
the
subject
in
the
prussian
diet
february
asserted
unfortunately
this
view
has
gained
followers
amongst
the
german
women
these
women
in
refusing
to
rear
strong
and
able
children
to
continue
the
race
drag
into
the
dust
that
which
is
the
highest
end
of
women
motherhood
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
willingness
to
bear
sacrifices
will
lead
to
a
change
for
the
better
we
need
an
increase
in
human
beings
to
guard
against
the
attacks
of
envious
neighbors
as
well
as
to
fulfil
our
cultural
mission
our
whole
economic
development
depends
on
increase
of
our
people
today
we
are
fully
aware
of
how
imperial
germany
fulfilled
that
cultural
mission
of
hers
nor
can
we
overlook
the
fact
that
the
countries
with
a
smaller
survived
the
ordeal
even
from
the
traditional
militaristic
standpoint
strength
does
not
reside
in
numbers
though
the
caesars
the
napoleons
and
the
kaisers
of
the
world
have
always
believed
that
large
exploitable
populations
were
necessary
for
their
own
individual
power
if
marxian
dictatorship
means
the
dictatorship
of
a
small
minority
wielding
power
in
the
interest
of
the
proletariat
a
rate
may
be
necessary
though
we
may
here
recall
the
answer
of
the
lamented
alfred
fried
to
the
german
imperialists
it
is
madness
the
apotheosis
of
unreason
to
wish
to
breed
and
care
for
human
beings
in
order
that
in
the
flower
of
their
youth
they
may
be
sent
in
millions
to
be
slaughtered
wholesale
by
machinery
we
need
no
wholesale
production
of
men
have
no
need
of
the
fertility
of
women
no
need
of
wholesale
wares
fattened
and
dressed
for
slaughter
what
we
do
need
is
careful
maintenance
of
those
already
born
if
the
bearing
of
children
is
a
moral
and
religious
duty
then
it
is
a
much
higher
duty
to
secure
the
sacredness
and
security
of
human
life
so
that
children
born
and
bred
with
trouble
and
sacrifice
may
not
be
offered
up
in
the
bloom
of
youth
to
a
political
dogma
at
the
bidding
of
secret
diplomacy
marxism
has
developed
a
patriotism
of
its
own
if
indeed
it
has
not
yet
been
completely
crystallized
into
a
religion
like
the
capitalistic
governments
it
so
vehemently
attacks
it
demands
and
even
martyrdom
from
the
faithful
comrades
but
since
its
strength
depends
to
so
great
a
degree
upon
conversion
upon
docile
acceptance
of
the
doctrines
of
the
master
as
interpreted
by
the
popes
and
bishops
of
this
new
church
it
fails
to
arouse
the
irreligious
proletariat
the
marxian
socialist
boasts
of
his
understanding
of
working
class
psychology
and
criticizes
the
lack
of
this
understanding
on
the
part
of
all
dissenters
but
as
the
socialists
meetings
against
the
birth
strike
indicate
the
working
class
is
not
interested
in
such
generalities
as
the
marxian
theory
of
value
the
iron
law
of
wages
the
value
of
commodities
and
the
rest
of
the
hazy
articles
of
faith
marx
inherited
the
rigid
nationalistic
psychology
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
his
followers
for
the
most
part
have
accepted
his
mechanical
and
superficial
treatment
of
instinct
discontented
workers
may
rally
to
marxism
because
it
places
the
blame
for
their
misery
outside
of
themselves
and
depicts
their
conditions
as
the
result
of
a
capitalistic
conspiracy
thereby
satisfying
that
innate
tendency
of
every
human
being
to
shift
the
blame
to
some
living
person
outside
himself
and
because
it
strengthens
his
belief
that
his
sufferings
and
difficulties
may
be
overcome
by
the
immediate
amelioration
of
his
economic
environment
in
this
manner
psychologists
tell
us
neuroses
and
inner
compulsions
are
fostered
no
true
solution
is
possible
to
continue
this
analogy
until
the
worker
is
awakened
to
the
realization
that
the
roots
of
his
malady
lie
deep
in
his
own
nature
his
own
organism
his
own
habits
to
blame
everything
upon
the
capitalist
and
the
environment
produced
by
capitalism
is
to
focus
attention
upon
merely
one
of
the
elements
of
the
problem
the
marxian
too
often
forgets
that
before
there
was
a
capitalist
there
was
exercised
the
unlimited
reproductive
activity
of
mankind
which
produced
the
first
overcrowding
the
first
want
this
goaded
humanity
into
its
industrial
frenzy
into
warfare
and
theft
and
slavery
capitalism
has
not
created
the
lamentable
state
of
affairs
in
which
the
world
now
finds
itself
it
has
grown
out
of
them
armed
with
the
inevitable
power
to
take
advantage
of
our
swarming
spawning
millions
as
that
valiant
thinker
monsieur
hardy
has
pointed
out
the
proletariat
may
be
looked
upon
not
as
the
antagonist
of
capitalism
but
as
its
accomplice
labor
surplus
or
the
army
of
reserve
which
as
for
decades
and
centuries
furnished
the
industrial
background
of
human
misery
which
so
invariably
defeats
strikes
and
labor
revolts
can
not
honestly
be
blamed
upon
capitalism
it
is
as
hardy
points
out
of
sexual
and
proletarian
origin
in
bringing
too
many
children
into
the
world
in
adding
to
the
total
of
misery
in
intensifying
the
evils
of
overcrowding
the
proletariat
itself
increases
the
burden
of
organized
labor
even
of
the
socialist
and
syndicalist
organizations
themselves
with
a
surplus
of
the
docilely
inefficient
with
those
great
uneducable
and
unorganizable
masses
with
surprisingly
few
exceptions
marxians
of
all
countries
have
docilely
followed
their
master
in
rejecting
with
bitterness
and
vindictiveness
that
is
difficult
to
explain
the
principles
and
teachings
of
birth
control
hunger
alone
is
not
responsible
for
the
bitter
struggle
for
existence
we
witness
in
our
civilization
sex
uncontrolled
misdirected
and
misunderstood
has
run
riot
at
the
instigation
of
priest
militarist
and
exploiter
uncontrolled
sex
has
rendered
the
proletariat
prostrate
the
capitalist
powerful
in
this
continuous
unceasing
alliance
of
sexual
instinct
and
hunger
we
find
the
reason
for
the
decline
of
all
the
finer
sentiments
these
instincts
tear
asunder
the
thin
veils
of
culture
and
hypocrisy
and
expose
to
our
gaze
the
dark
sufferings
of
gaunt
humanity
so
have
we
become
familiar
with
the
everyday
spectacle
of
distorted
bodies
of
harsh
and
frightful
diseases
stalking
abroad
in
the
light
of
day
of
misshapen
heads
and
visages
of
moron
and
imbecile
of
starving
children
in
city
streets
and
schools
this
is
the
true
soil
of
unspeakable
crimes
defect
and
delinquency
join
hands
with
disease
and
accounts
of
inconceivable
and
revolting
vices
are
dished
up
in
the
daily
press
when
the
majority
of
men
and
women
are
driven
by
the
grim
lash
of
sex
and
hunger
in
the
unending
struggle
to
feed
themselves
and
to
carry
the
of
dead
and
dying
progeny
when
little
children
are
forced
into
factories
streets
and
shops
education
including
even
education
in
the
marxian
dogmas
is
quite
impossible
and
civilization
is
more
completely
threatened
than
it
ever
could
be
by
pestilence
or
war
but
it
will
be
pointed
out
the
working
class
has
advanced
power
has
been
acquired
by
labor
unions
and
syndicates
in
the
beginning
power
was
won
by
the
principle
of
the
restriction
of
numbers
the
device
of
refusing
to
admit
more
than
a
fixed
number
of
new
members
to
the
unions
of
the
various
trades
has
been
justified
as
necessary
for
the
upholding
of
the
standard
of
wages
and
of
working
conditions
this
has
been
the
practice
in
precisely
those
unions
which
have
been
able
through
years
of
growth
and
development
to
attain
tangible
strength
and
power
such
a
principle
of
restriction
is
necessary
in
the
creation
of
a
firmly
and
deeply
rooted
trunk
or
central
organization
furnishing
a
local
center
for
more
extended
organization
it
is
upon
this
great
principle
of
restricted
number
that
the
labor
unions
have
generated
and
developed
power
they
have
acquired
this
power
without
any
religious
emotionalism
without
subscribing
to
metaphysical
or
economic
theology
for
the
millenium
and
the
earthly
paradise
to
be
enjoyed
at
some
indefinitely
future
date
the
union
member
substitutes
the
very
real
politics
of
organization
with
its
resultant
benefits
he
increases
his
own
independence
and
comfort
and
that
of
his
family
he
is
immune
to
superstitious
belief
in
and
respect
for
the
mysterious
power
of
political
or
economic
nostrums
to
reconstruct
human
society
according
to
the
marxian
formula
in
rejecting
the
marxian
hypothesis
as
superficial
and
fragmentary
we
do
so
not
because
of
its
revolutionary
character
its
threat
to
the
existing
order
of
things
but
rather
because
of
its
superficial
emotional
and
religious
character
and
its
deleterious
effect
upon
the
life
of
reason
like
other
schemes
advanced
by
the
alarmed
and
the
indignant
it
relies
too
much
upon
moral
fervor
and
enthusiasm
to
build
any
social
program
upon
the
shifting
sands
of
sentiment
and
feeling
of
indignation
or
enthusiasm
is
a
dangerous
and
foolish
task
on
the
other
hand
we
should
not
minimize
the
importance
of
the
socialist
movement
in
so
valiantly
and
so
courageously
battling
against
the
stagnating
complacency
of
our
conservatives
and
reactionaries
under
whose
benign
imbecility
the
defective
and
diseased
elements
of
humanity
are
encouraged
full
speed
ahead
in
their
reckless
and
irresponsible
swarming
and
spawning
nevertheless
as
george
drysdale
pointed
out
nearly
seventy
years
ago
if
we
ignore
this
and
other
sexual
subjects
we
may
do
whatever
else
we
like
we
may
bully
we
may
bluster
we
may
rage
we
may
foam
at
the
mouth
we
may
tear
down
heaven
with
our
prayers
we
may
exhaust
ourselves
with
weeping
over
the
sorrows
of
the
poor
we
may
narcotize
ourselves
and
others
with
the
opiate
of
christian
resignation
we
may
dissolve
the
realities
of
human
woe
in
a
delusive
mirage
of
poetry
and
ideal
philosophy
we
may
lavish
our
substance
in
charity
and
labor
over
possible
or
impossible
poor
laws
we
may
form
wild
dreams
of
socialism
industrial
regiments
universal
brotherhood
red
republics
or
unexampled
revolutions
we
may
strangle
and
murder
each
other
we
may
persecute
and
despise
those
whose
sexual
necessities
force
them
to
break
through
our
unnatural
moral
codes
we
may
burn
alive
if
we
please
the
prostitutes
and
the
adulterers
we
may
break
our
own
and
our
hearts
against
the
adamantine
laws
that
surround
us
but
not
one

not
one
shall
we
advance
till
we
acknowledge
these
laws
and
adopt
the
only
possible
mode
in
which

dangers

competition
eugenics
has
been
defined
as
the
study
of
agencies
under
social
control
that
may
improve
or
impair
the
racial
qualities
of
future
generations
either
mentally
or
physically
while
there
is
no
inherent
conflict
between
socialism
and
eugenics
the
latter
is
broadly
the
antithesis
of
the
former
in
its
propaganda
socialism
emphasizes
the
evil
effects
of
our
industrial
and
economic
system
it
insists
upon
the
necessity
of
satisfying
material
needs
upon
sanitation
hygiene
and
education
to
effect
the
transformation
of
society
the
socialist
insists
that
healthy
humanity
is
impossible
without
a
radical
improvement
of
the
social
and
therefore
of
the
economic
and
industrial
environment
the
eugenist
points
out
that
heredity
is
the
great
determining
factor
in
the
lives
of
men
and
women
eugenics
is
the
attempt
to
solve
the
problem
from
the
biological
and
evolutionary
point
of
view
you
may
bring
all
the
changes
possible
on
nurture
or
environment
the
eugenist
may
say
to
the
socialist
but
comparatively
little
can
be
effected
until
you
control
biological
and
hereditary
elements
of
the
problem
eugenics
thus
aims
to
seek
out
the
root
of
our
trouble
to
study
humanity
as
a
kinetic
dynamic
evolutionary
organism
shifting
and
changing
with
the
successive
generations
rising
and
falling
cleansing
itself
of
inherent
defects
or
under
adverse
and
dysgenic
influences
sinking
into
degeneration
and
deterioration
eugenics
was
first
defined
by
sir
francis
galton
in
his
human
faculty
in
and
was
subsequently
developed
into
a
science
and
into
an
educational
effort
galton
ideal
was
the
rational
breeding
of
human
beings
the
aim
of
eugenics
as
defined
by
its
founder
is
to
bring
as
many
influences
as
can
be
reasonably
employed
to
cause
the
useful
classes
of
the
community
to
contribute
more
than
their
proportion
to
the
next
generation
eugenics
thus
concerns
itself
with
all
influences
that
improve
the
inborn
qualities
of
a
race
also
with
those
that
develop
them
to
the
utmost
advantage
it
is
in
short
the
attempt
to
bring
reason
and
intelligence
to
bear
upon
heredity
but
galton
in
spite
of
the
immense
value
of
this
approach
and
his
great
stimulation
to
criticism
was
completely
unable
to
formulate
a
definite
and
practical
working
program
he
hoped
at
length
to
introduce
eugenics
into
the
national
conscience
like
a
new
religion
i
see
no
impossibility
in
eugenics
becoming
a
religious
dogma
among
mankind
but
its
details
must
first
be
worked
out
sedulously
in
the
study
leading
to
hasty
action
would
do
harm
by
holding
out
expectations
of
a
new
golden
age
which
will
certainly
be
falsified
and
cause
the
science
to
be
discredited
the
first
and
main
point
is
to
secure
the
general
intellectual
acceptance
of
eugenics
as
a
hopeful
and
most
important
study
then
let
its
principles
work
into
the
heart
of
the
nation
who
will
gradually
give
practical
effect
to
them
in
ways
that
we
may
not
wholly
foresee
galton
formulated
a
general
law
of
inheritance
which
declared
that
an
individual
receives
of
his
inheritance
from
his
two
parents
from
his
four
grandparents
from
his
from
his
grandparents
and
so
on
by
diminishing
fractions
to
his
primordial
ancestors
the
sum
of
all
these
fractions
added
together
contributing
to
the
whole
of
the
inherited
the
trouble
with
this
generalization
from
the
modern
mendelian
point
of
view
is
that
it
fails
to
define
what
characters
one
would
get
in
the
that
came
from
one
parents
or
the
from
one
grandparents
the
whole
of
our
inheritance
is
not
composed
of
these
indefinitely
made
up
fractional
parts
we
are
interested
rather
in
those
more
specific
traits
or
characters
mental
or
physical
which
in
the
mendelian
view
are
structural
and
functional
units
making
up
a
mosaic
rather
than
a
blend
the
laws
of
heredity
are
concerned
with
the
precise
behavior
during
a
series
of
generations
of
these
specific
unit
characters
this
behavior
as
the
study
of
genetics
shows
may
be
determined
in
lesser
organisms
by
experiment
once
determined
they
are
subject
to
prophecy
the
problem
of
human
heredity
is
now
seen
to
be
infinitely
more
complex
than
imagined
by
galton
and
his
followers
and
the
optimistic
hope
of
elevating
eugenics
to
the
level
of
a
religion
is
a
futile
one
most
of
the
eugenists
including
professor
karl
pearson
and
his
colleagues
of
the
eugenics
laboratory
of
the
university
of
london
and
of
the
biometric
laboratory
in
university
college
have
retained
the
point
of
view
of
nature
nurture
and
have
attempted
to
show
the
predominating
influence
of
heredity
as
opposed
to
environment
this
may
be
true
but
demonstrated
and
repeated
in
investigation
after
investigation
it
nevertheless
remains
fruitless
and
unprofitable
from
the
practical
point
of
view
we
should
not
minimize
the
great
outstanding
service
of
eugenics
for
critical
and
diagnostic
investigations
it
demonstrates
not
in
terms
of
glittering
generalization
but
in
statistical
studies
of
investigations
reduced
to
measurement
and
number
that
uncontrolled
fertility
is
universally
correlated
with
disease
poverty
overcrowding
and
the
transmission
of
hereditable
taints
professor
pearson
and
his
associates
show
us
that
if
fertility
be
correlated
with
hereditary
characters
a
population
will
inevitably
degenerate
this
degeneration
has
already
begun
eugenists
demonstrate
that
of
our
manhood
of
military
age
are
physically
too
unfit
to
shoulder
a
rifle
that
the
the
syphilitic
the

is
encouraged
by
the

of

to
populate

all
these
things
the
eugenists
sees
and
points
out
with
a
courage
entirely
admirable
but
as
a
positive
program
of
redemption
orthodox
eugenics
can
offer
nothing
more
constructive
than
a
renewed
cradle
competition
between
the
fit
and
the
unfit
it
sees
that
the
most
responsible
and
most
intelligent
members
of
society
are
the
less
fertile
that
the
are
the
more
fertile
herein
lies
the
unbalance
the
great
biological
menace
to
the
future
of
civilization
are
we
heading
to
biological
destruction
toward
the
gradual
but
certain
attack
upon
the
stocks
of
intelligence
and
racial
health
by
the
sinister
forces
of
the
hordes
of
irresponsibility
and
imbecility
this
is
not
such
a
remote
danger
as
the
optimistic
eugenist
might
suppose
the
mating
of
the
moron
with
a
person
of
sound
stock
may
as
tredgold
points
out
gradually
disseminate
this
trait
far
and
wide
until
it
undermines
the
vigor
and
efficiency
of
an
entire
nation
and
an
entire
race
this
is
no
idle
fancy
we
must
take
it
into
account
if
we
wish
to
escape
the
fate
that
has
befallen
so
many
civilizations
in
the
past
it
is
indeed
more
than
likely
that
the
presence
of
this
impairment
in
a
mitigated
form
is
responsible
for
no
little
of
the
defective
character
the
diminution
of
mental
and
moral
fiber
at
the
present
day
states
dr
tredgold
such
populations
this
distinguished
authority
might
have
added
form
the
veritable
cultures
not
only
for
contagious
physical
diseases
but
for
mental
instability
and
irresponsibility
also
they
are
susceptible
exploitable
hysterical
to
external
suggestion
devoid
of
stamina
such
folk
become
mere
units
in
a
mob
the
habit
of
is
daily
becoming
a
more
serious
menace
to
civilization
writes
everett
dean
martin
our
society
is
becoming
a
veritable
babel
of
gibbering
crowds
it
would
be
only
the
incorrigible
optimist
who
refused
to
see
the
integral
relation
between
this
phenomenon
and
the
indiscriminate
breeding
by
which
we
recruit
our
large
populations
the
danger
of
recruiting
our
numbers
from
the
most
fertile
stocks
is
further
emphasized
when
we
recall
that
in
a
democracy
like
that
of
the
united
states
every
man
and
woman
is
permitted
a
vote
in
the
government
and
that
it
is
the
representatives
of
this
grade
of
intelligence
who
may
destroy
our
liberties
and
who
may
thus
be
the
most
peril
to
the
future
of
civilization
it
is
a
pathological
worship
of
mere
number
writes
alleyne
ireland
which
has
inspired
all
the
efforts
the
primary
the
direct
election
of
senators
the
initiative
the
recall
and
the
referendum
to
cure
the
evils
of
mob
rule
by
increasing
the
size
of
the
mob
and
extending
its
powers
equality
of
political
power
has
thus
been
bestowed
upon
the
lowest
elements
of
our
population
we
must
not
be
surprised
therefore
at
the
spectacle
of
political
scandal
and
graft
of
the
notorious
and
universally
ridiculed
low
level
of
intelligence
and
flagrant
stupidity
exhibited
by
our
legislative
bodies
the
congressional
record
mirrors
our
political
imbecility
all
of
these
dangers
and
menaces
are
acutely
realized
by
the
eugenists
it
is
to
them
that
we
are
most
indebted
for
the
proof
that
reckless
spawning
carries
with
it
the
seeds
of
destruction
but
whereas
the
galtonians
reveal
themselves
as
unflinching
in
their
investigation
and
in
their
exhibition
of
fact
and
diagnoses
of
symptoms
they
do
not
on
the
other
hand
show
much
power
in
suggesting
practical
and
feasible
remedies
on
its
scientific
side
eugenics
suggests
the
reestabilishment
of
the
balance
between
the
fertility
of
the
fit
and
the
unfit
the
among
the
normal
and
healthier
and
finer
stocks
of
humanity
is
to
be
increased
by
awakening
among
the
fit
the
realization
of
the
dangers
of
a
lessened
in
proportion
to
the
reckless
breeding
among
the
unfit
by
education
by
persuasion
by
appeals
to
racial
ethics
and
religious
motives
the
ardent
eugenist
hopes
to
increase
the
fertility
of
the
fit
professor
pearson
thinks
that
it
is
especially
necessary
to
awaken
the
hardiest
stocks
to
this
duty
these
stocks
he
says
are
to
be
found
chiefly
among
the
skilled
artisan
class
the
intelligent
working
class
here
is
a
fine
combination
of
health
and
hardy
vigor
of
sound
body
and
sound
mind
professor
pearson
and
his
school
of
biometrics
here
ignore
or
at
least
fail
to
record
one
of
those
significant
correlations
which
form
the
basis
of
his
method
the
publications
of
the
eugenics
laboratory
all
tend
to
show
that
a
high
rate
of
fertility
is
correlated
with
extreme
poverty
recklessness
deficiency
and
delinquency
similarly
that
among
the
more
intelligent
this
rate
of
fertility
decreases
but
the
scientific
eugenists
fail
to
recognize
that
this
restraint
of
fecundity
is
due
to
a
deliberate
foresight
and
is
a
conscious
effort
to
elevate
standards
of
living
for
the
family
and
the
children
of
the
responsible
and
possibly
more
selfish
sections
of
the
community
the
appeal
to
enter
again
into
competitive
for
the
benefit
of
the
nation
or
the
race
or
any
other
abstraction
will
fall
on
deaf
ears
pearson
has
done
invaluable
work
in
pointing
out
the
fallacies
and
the
false
conclusions
of
the
ordinary
statisticians
but
when
he
attempts
to
show
by
the
methods
of
biometrics
that
not
only
the
first
child
but
also
the
second
are
especially
liable
to
suffer
from
transmissible
pathological
defects
such
as
insanity
criminality
and
tuberculosis
he
fails
to
recognize
that
this
tendency
is
counterbalanced
by
the
high
mortality
rate
among
later
children
if
first
and
second
children
reveal
a
greater
percentage
of
heritable
defect
it
is
because
the
later
born
children
are
less
liable
to
survive
the
conditions
produced
by
a
large
family
in
passing
we
should
here
recognize
the
difficulties
presented
by
the
idea
of
fit
and
unfit
who
is
to
decide
this
question
the
grosser
the
more
obvious
the
undeniably
should
indeed
not
only
be
discouraged
but
prevented
from
propagating
their
kind
but
among
the
writings
of
the
representative
eugenists
one
can
not
ignore
the
distinct
bias
that
prevails
as
that
penetrating
critic
stella
browne
has
said
in
another
connection
the
eugenics
education
society
has
among
its
numbers
many
most
and
truly
progressive
individuals
but
the
official
policy
it
has
pursued
for
years
has
been
inspired
by
and
sex
bias
the
society
laments
with
increasing
vehemence
the
multiplication
of
the
less
fortunate
classes
at
a
more
rapid
rate
than
the
possessors
of
leisure
and
opportunity
i
do
not
think
it
relevant
here
to
discuss
whether
the
innate
superiority
of
endowment
in
the
governing
class
really
is
so
overwhelming
as
to
justify
the
eugenics
education
society
peculiar
use
of
the
terms
and
yet
it
has
persistently
refused
to
give
any
help
toward
extending
the
knowledge
of
contraceptives
to
the
exploited
classes
similarly
though
the
eugenics
review
the
organ
of
the
society
frequently
laments
the
of
the
refusal
of
maternity
by
healthy
and
educated
women
of
the
professional
classes
i
have
yet
to
learn
that
it
has
made
any
official
pronouncement
on
the
english
illegitimacy
laws
or
any
organized
effort
toward
defending
the
unmarried
mother
this
peculiarly
victorian
reticence
may
be
inherited
from
the
founder
of
eugenics
galton
declared
that
the
bohemian
element
in
the
race
is
destined
to
perish
and
the
sooner
it
goes
the
happier
for
mankind
the
trouble
with
any
effort
of
trying
to
divide
humanity
into
the
fit
and
the
unfit
is
that
we
do
not
want
as
wells
recently
pointed
out
to
breed
for
uniformity
but
for
variety
we
want
statesmen
and
poets
and
musicians
and
philosophers
and
strong
men
and
delicate
men
and
brave
men
the
qualities
of
one
would
be
the
weaknesses
of
the
other
we
want
most
of
all
genius
proscription
on
galtonian
lines
would
tend
to
eliminate
many
of
the
great
geniuses
of
the
world
who
were
not
only
bohemian
but
actually
and
pathologically
abnormal
men
like
rousseau
dostoevsky
chopin
poe
schumann
nietzsche
comte
guy
de
maupassant
and
how
many
others
but
such
considerations
should
not
lead
us
into
error
of
concluding
that
such
men
were
geniuses
merely
because
they
were
pathological
specimens
and
that
the
only
way
to
produce
a
genius
is
to
breed
disease
and
defect
it
only
emphasizes
the
dangers
of
external
standards
of
fit
and
unfit
these
limitations
are
more
strikingly
shown
in
the
types
of
eugenic
legislation
passed
or
proposed
by
certain
enthusiasts
regulation
compulsion
and
prohibitions
affected
and
enacted
by
political
bodies
are
the
surest
methods
of
driving
the
whole
problem
as
havelock
ellis
has
pointed
out
the
absurdity
and
even
hopelessness
of
effecting
eugenic
improvement
by
placing
on
the
statute
books
prohibitions
of
legal
matrimony
to
certain
classes
of
people
reveal
the
weakness
of
those
eugenists
who
minimize
or
undervalue
the
importance
of
environment
as
a
determining
factor
they
affirm
that
heredity
is
everything
and
environment
nothing
yet
forget
that
it
is
precisely
those
who
are
most
universally
subject
to
bad
environment
who
procreate
most
copiously
most
recklessly
and
most
disastrously
such
marriage
laws
are
based
for
the
most
part
on
the
infantile
assumption
that
procreation
is
absolutely
dependent
upon
the
marriage
ceremony
an
assumption
usually
coupled
with
the
complementary
one
that
the
only
purpose
in
marriage
is
procreation
yet
it
is
a
fact
so
obvious
that
it
is
hardly
worth
stating
that
the
most
fertile
classes
who
indulge
in
the
most
dysgenic
type
of
procreating
the
are
almost
totally
unaffected
by
marriage
laws
and
as
for
the
sterilization
of
habitual
criminals
not
merely
must
we
know
more
of
heredity
and
genetics
in
general
but
also
acquire
more
certainty
of
the
justice
of
our
laws
and
the
honesty
of
their
administration
before
we
can
make
rulings
of
fitness
or
unfitness
merely
upon
the
basis
of
a
respect
for
law
on
this
point
the
eminent
william
bateson
writes
criminals
are
often
but
as
regards
those
that
are
not
the
fact
that
a
man
is
for
the
purposes
of
society
classified
as
a
criminal
tells
me
little
as
to
his
value
still
less
as
to
the
possible
value
of
his
offspring
it
is
a
fault
inherent
in
criminal
jurisprudence
based
on
data
that
the
law
must
needs
take
the
nature
of
the
offenses
rather
than
that
of
the
offenders
as
the
basis
of
classification
a
change
in
the
right
direction
has
begun
but
the
problem
is
difficult
and
progress
will
be
very
slow
we
all
know
of
persons
convicted
perhaps
even
habitually
whom
the
world
could
ill
spare
therefore
i
hesitate
to
proscribe
the
criminal
proscription
is
a
weapon
with
a
very
nasty
recoil
might
not
some
with
equal
cogency
proscribe
army
contractors
and
their
accomplices
the
newspaper
patriots
the
crimes
of
the
prison
population
are
petty
offenses
by
comparison
and
the
significance
we
attach
to
them
is
a
survival
of
other
days
felonies
may
be
great
events
locally
but
they
do
not
induce
catastrophies
the
proclivities
of
the
are
infinitely
more
dangerous
than
those
of
the
aberrant
beings
whom
from
time
to
time
the
law
may
dub
as
criminal
consistent
and
portentous
selfishness
combined
with
dullness
of
imagination
is
probably
just
as
transmissible
as
want
of
though
destitute
of
the
amiable
qualities
not
rarely
associated
with
the
genetic
composition
of
persons
of
unstable
mind
in
this
connection
we
should
note
another
type
of
respectable
criminality
noted
by
havelock
ellis
if
those
persons
who
raise
the
cry
of
in
face
of
the
decline
of
the
really
had
the
knowledge
and
the
intelligence
to
realize
the
manifold
evils
which
they
are
invoking
they
would
deserve
to
be
treated
as
criminals
our
debt
to
the
science
of
eugenics
is
great
in
that
it
directs
our
attention
to
the
biological
nature
of
humanity
yet
there
is
too
great
a
tendency
among
the
thinkers
of
this
school
to
restrict
their
ideas
of
sex
to
its
expression
as
a
purely
procreative
function
compulsory
legislation
which
would
make
the
inevitably
futile
attempt
to
prohibit
one
of
the
most
beneficent
and
necessary
of
human
expressions
or
regulate
it
into
the
channels
of
preconceived
philosophies
would
reduce
us
to
the
unpleasant
days
predicted
by
william
blake
when
priests
in
black
gowns
will
be
walking
their
rounds
and
binding
with
briars
our
joys
and
desires
eugenics
is
chiefly
valuable
in
its
negative
aspects
it
is
negative
eugenics
that
has
studied
the
histories
of
such
families
as
the
jukeses
and
the
kallikaks
that
has
pointed
out
the
network
of
imbecility
and
that
has
been
sedulously
spread
through
all
strata
of
society
on
its
positive
or
constructive
side
it
fails
to
awaken
any
permanent
interest
constructive
eugenics
aims
to
arouse
the
enthusiasm
or
the
interest
of
the
people
in
the
welfare
of
the
world
fifteen
or
twenty
generations
in
the
future
on
its
negative
side
it
shows
us
that
we
are
paying
for
and
even
submitting
to
the
dictates
of
an
ever
increasing
unceasingly
spawning
class
of
human
beings
who
never
should
have
been
born
at
all
that
the
wealth
of
individuals
and
of
states
is
being
diverted
from
the
development
and
the
progress
of
human
expression
and
civilization
while
it
is
necessary
to
point
out
the
importance
of
heredity
as
a
determining
factor
in
human
life
it
is
fatal
to
elevate
it
to
the
position
of
an
absolute
as
with
environment
the
concept
of
heredity
derives
its
value
and
its
meaning
only
in
so
far
as
it
is
embodied
and
made
concrete
in
generations
of
living
organisms
environment
and
heredity
are
not
antagonistic
our
problem
is
not
that
of
nature
nurture
but
rather
of
nature
x
nurture
of
heredity
multiplied
by
environment
if
we
may
express
it
thus
the
eugenist
who
overlooks
the
importance
of
environment
as
a
determining
factor
in
human
life
is
as
as
the
socialist
who
neglects
the
biological
nature
of
man
we
can
not
disentangle
these
two
forces
except
in
theory
to
the
child
in
the
womb
said
samuel
butler
the
mother
is
environment
she
is
of
course
likewise
heredity
the
discussion
of
nature
nurture
has
been
threshed
out
time
after
time
usually
fruitlessly
because
of
a
failure
to
recognize
the
indivisibility
of
these
biological
factors
the
opposition
or
antagonism
between
them
is
an
artificial
and
academic
one
having
no
basis
in
the
living
organism
the
great
principle
of
birth
control
offers
the
means
whereby
the
individual
may
adapt
himself
to
and
even
control
the
forces
of
environment
and
heredity
entirely
apart
from
its
malthusian
aspect
or
that
of
the
population
question
birth
control
must
be
recognized
as
the
pointed
out
long
ago
not
merely
as
the
key
of
the
social
position
and
the
only
possible
and
practical
method
of
human
generation
but
as
the
very
pivot
of
civilization
birth
control
which
has
been
criticized
as
negative
and
destructive
is
really
the
greatest
and
most
truly
eugenic
method
and
its
adoption
as
part
of
the
program
of
eugenics
would
immediately
give
a
concrete
and
realistic
power
to
that
science
as
a
matter
of
fact
birth
control
has
been
accepted
by
the
most
clear
thinking
and
far
seeing
of
the
eugenists
themselves
as
the
most
constructive
and
necessary
of
the

orthodox
opposition
to
birth
control
is
formulated
in
the
official
protest
of
the
national
council
of
catholic
women
against
the
resolution
passed
by
the
new
york
state
federation
of
women
clubs
which
favored
the
removal
of
all
obstacles
to
the
spread
of
information
regarding
practical
methods
of
birth
control
the
catholic
statement
completely
embodies
traditional
opposition
to
birth
control
it
affords
a
striking
contrast
by
which
we
may
clarify
and
justify
the
ethical
necessity
for
this
new
instrument
of
civilization
as
the
most
effective
basis
for
practical
and
scientific
morality
the
authorities
at
rome
have
again
and
again
declared
that
all
positive
methods
of
this
nature
are
immoral
and
forbidden
states
the
national
council
of
catholic
women
there
is
no
question
of
the
lawfulness
of
birth
restriction
through
abstinence
from
the
relations
which
result
in
conception
the
immorality
of
birth
control
as
it
is
practised
and
commonly
understood
consists
in
the
evils
of
the
particular
method
employed
these
are
all
contrary
to
the
moral
law
because
they
are
unnatural
being
a
perversion
of
a
natural
function
human
faculties
are
used
in
such
a
way
as
to
frustrate
the
natural
end
for
which
these
faculties
were
created
this
is
always
intrinsically
wrong
as
wrong
as
lying
and
blasphemy
no
supposed
beneficial
consequence
can
make
good
a
practice
which
is
in
itself
immoral
the
evil
results
of
the
practice
of
birth
control
are
numerous
attention
will
be
called
here
to
only
three
the
first
is
the
degradation
of
the
marital
relation
itself
since
the
husband
and
wife
who
indulge
in
any
form
of
this
practice
come
to
have
a
lower
idea
of
married
life
they
can
not
help
coming
to
regard
each
other
to
a
great
extent
as
mutual
instruments
of
sensual
gratification
rather
than
as
cooperators
with
the
creating
in
bringing
children
into
the
world
this
consideration
may
be
subtle
but
it
undoubtedly
represents
the
facts
in
the
second
place
the
deliberate
restriction
of
the
family
through
these
immoral
practices
deliberately
weakens
and
the
capacity
for
and
increases
the
love
of
ease
and
luxury
the
best
indication
of
this
is
that
the
small
family
is
much
more
prevalent
in
the
classes
that
are
comfortable
and
than
among
those
whose
material
advantages
are
moderate
or
small
the
theory
of
the
advocates
of
birth
control
is
that
those
parents
who
are
comfortably
situated
should
have
a
large
number
of
children
sic
while
the
poor
should
restrict
their
offspring
to
a
much
smaller
number
this
theory
does
not
work
for
the
reason
that
each
married
couple
have
their
own
idea
of
what
constitutes
unreasonable
hardship
in
the
matter
of
bearing
and
rearing
children
a
large
proportion
of
the
parents
who
are
addicted
to
birth
control
practices
are
sufficiently
provided
with
worldly
goods
to
be
free
from
apprehension
on
the
economic
side
nevertheless
they
have
small
families
because
they
are
disinclined
to
undertake
the
other
burdens
involved
in
bringing
up
a
more
numerous
family
a
practice
which
tends
to
produce
such
exaggerated
notions
of
what
constitutes
hardship
which
leads
men
and
women
to
cherish
such
a
degree
of
ease
makes
inevitably
for
inefficiency
a
decline
in
the
capacity
to
endure
and
to
achieve
and
for
a
general
social
decadence
finally
birth
control
leads
sooner
or
later
to
a
decline
in
population
the
case
of
france
is
instanced
but
it
is
essentially
the
moral
question
that
alarms
the
catholic
women
for
the
statement
concludes
the
further
effect
of
such
proposed
legislation
will
inevitably
be
a
lowering
both
of
public
and
private
morals
what
the
fathers
of
this
country
termed
indecent
and
forbade
the
mails
to
carry
will
if
such
legislation
is
carried
through
be
legally
decent
the
purveyors
of
sexual
license
and
immorality
will
have
the
opportunity
to
send
almost
anything
they
care
to
write
through
the
mails
on
the
plea
that
it
is
sex
information
not
only
the
married
but
also
the
unmarried
will
be
thus
affected
the
ideals
of
the
young
contaminated
and
lowered
the
morals
of
the
entire
nation
will
suffer
the
proper
attitude
of
catholics
is
clear
they
should
watch
and
oppose
all
attempts
in
state
legislatures
and
in
congress
to
repeal
the
laws
which
now
prohibit
the
dissemination
of
information
concerning
birth
control
such
information
will
be
spread
only
too
rapidly
despite
existing
laws
to
repeal
these
would
greatly
accelerate
this
deplorable
movement
the
catholic
position
has
been
stated
in
an
even
more
extreme
form
by
archbishop
patrick
hayes
of
the
archdiocese
of
new
york
in
a
christmas
pastoral
this
dignitary
even
went
to
the
extent
of
declaring
that
even
though
some
little
angels
in
the
flesh
through
the
physical
or
mental
deformities
of
their
parents
may
appear
to
human
eyes
hideous
misshapen
a
blot
on
civilized
society
we
must
not
lose
sight
of
this
christian
thought
that
under
and
within
such
visible
malformation
lives
an
immortal
soul
to
be
saved
and
glorified
for
all
eternity
among
the
blessed
in
heaven
with
the
type
of
moral
philosophy
expressed
in
this
utterance
we
need
not
argue
it
is
based
upon
traditional
ideas
that
have
had
the
practical
effect
of
making
this
world
a
vale
of
tears
fortunately
such
words
carry
no
weight
with
those
who
can
bring
free
and
keen
as
well
as
noble
minds
to
the
consideration
of
the
matter
to
them
the
idealism
of
such
an
utterance
appears
crude
and
cruel
the
menace
to
civilization
of
such
orthodoxy
if
it
be
orthodoxy
lies
in
the
fact
that
its
powerful
exponents
may
be
for
a
time
successful
not
merely
in
influencing
the
conduct
of
their
adherents
but
in
checking
freedom
of
thought
and
discussion
to
this
with
all
the
vehemence
of
emphasis
at
our
command
we
object
from
what
archbishop
hayes
believes
concerning
the
future
blessedness
in
heaven
of
the
souls
of
those
who
are
born
into
this
world
as
hideous
and
misshapen
beings
he
has
a
right
to
seek
such
consolation
as
may
be
obtained
but
we
who
are
trying
to
better
the
conditions
of
this
world
believe
that
a
healthy
happy
human
race
is
more
in
keeping
with
the
laws
of
god
than
disease
misery
and
poverty
perpetuating
itself
generation
after
generation
furthermore
while
conceding
to
catholic
or
other
churchmen
full
freedom
to
preach
their
own
doctrines
whether
of
theology
or
morals
nevertheless
when
they
attempt
to
carry
these
ideas
into
legislative
acts
and
force
their
opinions
and
codes
upon
the
we
consider
such
action
an
interference
with
the
principles
of
democracy
and
we
have
a
right
to
protest
religious
propaganda
against
birth
control
is
crammed
with
contradiction
and
fallacy
it
refutes
itself
yet
it
brings
the
opposing
views
into
vivid
contrast
in
stating
these
differences
we
should
make
clear
that
advocates
of
birth
control
are
not
seeking
to
attack
the
catholic
church
we
quarrel
with
that
church
however
when
it
seeks
to
assume
authority
over
and
to
dub
their
behavior
immoral
because
they
do
not
conform
to
the
dictatorship
of
rome
the
question
of
bearing
and
rearing
children
we
hold
is
the
concern
of
the
mother
and
the
potential
mother
if
she
delegates
the
responsibility
the
ethical
education
to
an
external
authority
that
is
her
affair
we
object
however
to
the
state
or
the
church
which
appoints
itself
as
arbiter
and
dictator
in
this
sphere
and
attempts
to
force
unwilling
women
into
compulsory
maternity
when
catholics
declare
that
the
authorities
at
rome
have
again
and
again
declared
that
all
positive
methods
of
this
nature
are
immoral
and
forbidden
they
do
so
upon
the
assumption
that
morality
consists
in
conforming
to
laws
laid
down
and
enforced
by
external
authority
in
submission
to
decrees
and
dicta
imposed
from
without
in
this
case
they
decide
in
a
wholesale
manner
the
conduct
of
millions
demanding
of
them
not
the
intelligent
exercise
of
their
own
individual
judgment
and
discrimination
but
unquestioning
submission
and
conformity
to
dogma
the
church
thus
takes
the
place
of
parents
and
demands
of
its
children
merely
that
they
should
obey
in
my
belief
such
a
philosophy
hampers
the
development
of
individual
intelligence
morality
then
becomes
a
more
or
less
successful
attempt
to
conform
to
a
code
instead
of
an
attempt
to
bring
reason
and
intelligence
to
bear
upon
the
solution
of
each
individual
human
problem
but
we
read
on
birth
control
methods
are
not
merely
contrary
to
moral
law
but
forbidden
because
they
are
unnatural
being
the
perversion
of
a
natural
function
this
of
course
is
the
weakest
link
in
the
whole
chain
yet
there
is
no
question
of
the
lawfulness
of
birth
restriction
through
abstinence
as
though
abstinence
itself
were
not
unnatural
for
more
than
a
thousand
years
the
church
was
occupied
with
the
problem
of
imposing
abstinence
on
its
priesthood
its
most
educated
and
trained
body
of
men
educated
to
look
upon
asceticism
as
the
finest
ideal
it
took
one
thousand
years
to
convince
the
catholic
priesthood
that
abstinence
was
natural
or
practicable
nevertheless
there
is
still
this
talk
of
abstinence
and
almost
in
the
same
breath
with
the
condemnation
of
birth
control
as
unnatural
if
it
is
our
duty
to
act
as
cooperators
with
the
creator
to
bring
children
into
the
world
it
is
difficult
to
say
at
what
point
our
behavior
is
unnatural
if
it
is
immoral
and
unnatural
to
prevent
an
unwanted
life
from
coming
into
existence
is
it
not
immoral
and
unnatural
to
remain
unmarried
from
the
age
of
puberty
such
casuistry
is
unconvincing
and
feeble
we
need
only
point
out
that
rational
intelligence
is
also
a
natural
function
and
that
it
is
as
imperative
for
us
to
use
the
faculties
of
judgment
criticism
discrimination
of
choice
selection
and
control
all
the
faculties
of
the
intelligence
as
it
is
to
use
those
of
reproduction
it
is
certainly
dangerous
to
frustrate
the
natural
ends
for
which
these
faculties
were
created
this
also
is
always
intrinsically
wrong
as
wrong
as
lying
and
blasphemy
and
infinitely
more
devastating
intelligence
is
as
natural
to
us
as
any
other
faculty
and
it
is
fatal
to
moral
development
and
growth
to
refuse
to
use
it
and
to
delegate
to
others
the
solution
of
our
individual
problems
the
evil
will
not
be
that
one
conduct
is
divergent
from
current
and
conventional
moral
codes
there
may
be
every
outward
evidence
of
conformity
but
this
agreement
may
be
arrived
at
by
the
restriction
and
suppression
of
subjective
desires
and
the
more
or
less
successful
attempt
at
mere
conformity
such
morality
would
conceal
an
inner
conflict
the
fruits
of
this
conflict
would
be
neurosis
and
hysteria
on
the
one
hand
or
concealed
gratification
of
suppressed
desires
on
the
other
with
a
resultant
hypocrisy
and
cant
true
morality
can
not
be
based
on
conformity
there
must
be
no
conflict
between
subjective
desire
and
outward
behavior
to
object
to
these
traditional
and
churchly
ideas
does
not
by
any
means
imply
that
the
doctrine
of
birth
control
is
on
the
contrary
it
may
be
profoundly
in
accordance
with
the
sermon
on
the
mount
one
of
the
greatest
living
theologians
and
most
penetrating
students
of
the
problems
of
civilization
is
of
this
opinion
in
an
address
delivered
before
the
eugenics
education
society
of
london
william
ralph
inge
the
very
reverend
dean
of
paul
cathedral
london
pointed
out
that
the
doctrine
of
birth
control
was
to
be
interpreted
as
of
the
very
essence
of
christianity
we
should
be
ready
to
give
up
all
our
theories
he
asserted
if
science
proved
that
we
were
on
the
wrong
lines
and
we
can
understand
though
we
profoundly
disagree
with
those
who
oppose
us
on
the
grounds
of
authority
we
know
where
we
are
with
a
man
who
says
control
is
forbidden
by
god
we
prefer
poverty
unemployment
war
the
physical
intellectual
and
moral
degeneration
of
the
people
and
a
high
death
rate
to
any
interference
with
the
universal
command
to
be
fruitful
and
multiply
but
we
have
no
patience
with
those
who
say
that
we
can
have
unrestricted
and
unregulated
propagation
without
those
consequences
it
is
a
great
part
of
our
work
to
press
home
to
the
public
mind
the
alternative
that
lies
before
us
either
rational
selection
must
take
the
place
of
the
natural
selection
which
the
modern
state
will
not
allow
to
act
or
we
must
go
on
deteriorating
when
we
can
convince
the
public
of
this
the
opposition
of
organized
religion
will
soon
collapse
or
become
ineffective
dean
inge
effectively
answers
those
who
have
objected
to
the
methods
of
birth
control
as
immoral
and
in
contradiction
and
inimical
to
the
teachings
of
christ
incidentally
he
claims
that
those
who
are
not
blinded
by
prejudices
recognize
that
christianity
aims
at
saving
the
soul
the
personality
the
nature
of
man
not
his
body
or
his
environment
according
to
christianity
a
man
is
saved
not
by
what
he
has
or
knows
or
does
but
by
what
he
is
it
treats
all
the
apparatus
of
life
with
a
disdain
as
great
as
that
of
the
biologist
so
long
as
a
man
is
inwardly
healthy
it
cares
very
little
whether
he
is
rich
or
poor
learned
or
simple
and
even
whether
he
is
happy
or
unhappy
it
attaches
no
importance
to
quantitative
measurements
of
any
kind
the
christian
does
not
gloat
over
favorable
nor
congratulate
himself
on
the
disparity
between
the
number
of
births
and
deaths
for
him
the
test
of
the
welfare
of
a
country
is
the
quality
of
human
beings
whom
it
produces
quality
is
everything
quantity
is
nothing
and
besides
this
the
christian
conception
of
a
kingdom
of
god
upon
the
earth
teaches
us
to
turn
our
eyes
to
the
future
and
to
think
of
the
welfare
of
posterity
as
a
thing
which
concerns
us
as
much
as
that
of
our
own
generation
this
welfare
as
conceived
by
christianity
is
of
course
something
different
from
external
prosperity
it
is
to
be
the
victory
of
intrinsic
worth
and
healthiness
over
all
the
false
ideals
and
diseases
which
at
present
spoil
civilization
it
is
not
political
religion
with
which
i
am
concerned
dean
inge
explained
but
the
convictions
of
really
religious
persons
and
i
do
not
think
that
we
need
despair
of
converting
them
to
our
views
dean
inge
believes
birth
control
is
an
essential
part
of
eugenics
and
an
essential
part
of
christian
morality
on
this
point
he
asserts
we
do
wish
to
remind
our
orthodox
and
conservative
friends
that
the
sermon
on
the
mount
contains
some
admirably
clear
and
unmistakable
eugenic
precepts
men
gather
grapes
of
thorns
or
figs
of
thistles
a
corrupt
tree
can
not
bring
forth
good
fruit
neither
can
a
good
tree
bring
forth
evil
fruit
every
tree
which
bringeth
not
forth
good
fruit
is
hewn
down
and
cast
into
the
fire
we
wish
to
apply
these
words
not
only
to
the
actions
of
individuals
which
spring
from
their
characters
but
to
the
character
of
individuals
which
spring
from
their
inherited
qualities
this
extension
of
the
scope
of
the
maxim
seems
to
me
quite
legitimate
men
do
not
gather
grapes
of
thorns
as
our
proverb
says
you
can
not
make
a
silk
purse
out
of
a
sow
ear
if
we
believe
this
and
do
not
act
upon
it
by
trying
to
move
public
opinion
towards
giving
social
reform
education
and
religion
a
better
material
to
work
upon
we
are
sinning
against
the
light
and
not
doing
our
best
to
bring
in
the
kingdom
of
god
upon
earth
as
long
as
sexual
activity
is
regarded
in
a
dualistic
and
contradictory
light
in
which
it
is
revealed
either
as
the
instrument
by
which
men
and
women
cooperate
with
the
creator
to
bring
children
into
the
world
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
as
the
sinful
instrument
of
lust
and
sensuality
there
is
bound
to
be
an
endless
conflict
in
human
conduct
producing
ever
increasing
misery
pain
and
injustice
in
crystallizing
and
codifying
this
contradiction
the
church
not
only
solidified
its
own
power
over
men
but
reduced
women
to
the
most
abject
and
prostrate
slavery
it
was
essentially
a
morality
that
would
not
work
the
sex
instinct
in
the
human
race
is
too
strong
to
be
bound
by
the

that
only
in

humanity
we
are
glad
to
realize
is
rapidly
freeing
itself
from
this
morality
imposed
upon
it
by
its
and
masters
from
a
hundred
different
points
the
imposing
edifice
of
this
morality
has
been
and
is
being
attacked
sincere
and
thoughtful
defenders
and
exponents
of
the
teachings
of
christ
now
acknowledge
the
falsity
of
the
traditional
codes
and
their
malignant
influence
upon
the
moral
and
physical
of
humanity
ecclesiastical
opposition
to
birth
control
on
the
part
of
certain
representatives
of
the
protestant
churches
based
usually
on
quotations
from
the
bible
is
equally
invalid
and
for
the
same
reason
the
attitude
of
the
more
intelligent
and
enlightened
clergy
has
been
well
and
succinctly
expressed
by
dean
inge
who
referring
to
the
ethics
of
birth
control
writes
this
is
emphatically
a
matter
in
which
every
man
and
woman
must
judge
for
themselves
and
must
refrain
from
judging
others
we
must
not
neglect
the
important
fact
that
it
is
not
merely
in
the
practical
results
of
such
a
decision
not
in
the
small
number
of
children
not
even
in
the
healthier
and
better
cared
for
children
not
in
the
possibility
of
elevating
the
living
conditions
of
the
individual
family
that
the
ethical
value
of
birth
control
alone
lies
precisely
because
the
practice
of
birth
control
does
demand
the
exercise
of
decision
the
making
of
choice
the
use
of
the
reasoning
powers
is
it
an
instrument
of
moral
education
as
well
as
of
hygienic
and
racial
advance
it
awakens
the
attention
of
parents
to
their
potential
children
it
forces
upon
the
individual
consciousness
the
question
of
the
standards
of
living
in
a
profound
manner
it
protects
and
reasserts
the
inalienable
rights
of
the
psychology
and
the
outlook
of
modern
life
are
stressing
the
growth
of
independent
responsibility
and
discrimination
as
the
true
basis
of
ethics
the
old
traditional
morality
with
its
train
of
vice
disease
promiscuity
and
prostitution
is
in
reality
dying
out
killing
itself
off
because
it
is
too
irresponsible
and
too
dangerous
to
individual
and
social
the
transition
from
the
old
to
the
new
like
all
fundamental
changes
is
fraught
with
many
dangers
but
it
is
a
revolution
that
can
not
be
stopped
the
smaller
family
with
its
lower
infant
mortality
rate
is
in
more
definite
and
concrete
manner
than
many
actions
outwardly
deemed
moral
the
expression
of
moral
judgment
and
responsibility
it
is
the
assertion
of
a
standard
of
living
inspired
by
the
wish
to
obtain
a
fuller
and
more
expressive
life
for
the
children
than
the
parents
have
enjoyed
if
the
morality
or
immorality
of
any
course
of
conduct
is
to
be
determined
by
the
motives
which
inspire
it
there
is
evidently
at
the
present
day
no
higher
morality
than
the
intelligent
practice
of
birth
control
the
immorality
of
many
who
practise
birth
control
lies
in
not
daring
to
preach
what
they
practise
what
is
the
secret
of
the
hypocrisy
of
the
who
are
willing
to
contribute
generously
to
charities
and
philanthropies
who
spend
thousands
annually
in
the
upkeep
and
sustenance
of
the
delinquent
the
defective
and
the
dependent
and
yet
join
the
conspiracy
of
silence
that
prevents
the
poorer
classes
from
learning
how
to
improve
their
conditions
and
elevate
their
standards
of
living
it
is
as
though
they
were
to
cry
we
give
you
anything
except
the
thing
you
ask
for
the
means
whereby
you
may
become
responsible
and
in
your
own
lives
the
brunt
of
this
injustice
falls
on
women
because

traditional
morality
is
the
invention

in

department
of

in

have
been
so

to

and
expression
of
power
on
the
part
of

this
power
will
not

found
in
any
futile
seeking
for

in

of

experience
the
joys
of
a
new
and
fuller
freedom
on
this
great
fundamental
and
pivotal
point
new
light
has
been
thrown
by
lord
bertrand
dawson
the
physician
of
the
king
of
england
in
the
remarkable
and
address
at
the
birmingham
church
congress
referred
to
in
my
introduction
he
spoke
of
the
supreme
morality
of
the
mutual
and
reciprocal
joy
in
the
most
intimate
relation
between
man
and
woman
without
this
reciprocity
there
can
be
no
civilization
worthy
of
the
name
lord
dawson
suggested
that
there
should
be
added
to
the
clauses
of
marriage
in
the
prayer
book
the
complete
realization
of
the
love
of
this
man
and
this
woman
one
for
another
and
in
support
of
his
contention
declared
that
sex
love
between
husband
and
wife
apart
from
parenthood
was
something
to
prize
and
cherish
for
its
own
sake
the
lambeth
conference
he
remarked
envisaged
a
love
invertebrate
and
joyless
whereas
in
his
view
natural
passion
in
wedlock
was
not
a
thing
to
be
ashamed
of
or
unduly
repressed
the
pronouncement
of
the
church
of
england
as
set
forth
in
resolution
of
the
lambeth
conference
seems
to
imply
condemnation
of
sex
love
as
such
and
to
imply
sanction
of
sex
love
only
as
a
means
to
an
end
namely
procreation
the
lambeth
resolution
stated
in
opposition
to
the
teaching
which
under
the
name
of
science
and
religion
encourages
married
people
in
the
deliberate
cultivation
of
sexual
union
as
an
end
in
itself
we
steadfastly
uphold
what
must
always
be
regarded
as
the
governing
considerations
of
christian
marriage
one
is
the
primary
purpose
for
which
marriage
exists
namely
the
continuation
of
the
race
through
the
gift
and
heritage
of
children
the
other
is
the
paramount
importance
in
married
life
of
deliberate
and
thoughtful
in
answer
to
this
point
of
view
lord
dawson
asserted
sex
love
has
apart
from
parenthood
a
purport
of
its
own
it
is
something
to
prize
and
to
cherish
for
its
own
sake
it
is
an
essential
part
of
health
and
happiness
in
marriage
and
now
if
you
will
allow
me
i
will
carry
this
argument
a
step
further
if
sexual
union
is
a
gift
of
god
it
is
worth
learning
how
to
use
it
within
its
own
sphere
it
should
be
cultivated
so
as
to
bring
physical
satisfaction
to
both
not
merely
to
one
the
real
problems
before
us
are
those
of
sex
love
and
child
love
and
by
sex
love
i
mean
that
love
which
involves
intercourse
or
the
desire
for
such
it
is
necessary
to
my
argument
to
emphasize
that
sex
love
is
one
of
the
dominating
forces
of
the
world
not
only
does
history
show
the
destinies
of
nations
and
dynasties
determined
by
its
sway
but
here
in
our
life
we
see
its
influence
direct
or
indirect
forceful
and
ubiquitous
beyond
aught
else
any
statesmanlike
view
therefore
will
recognize
that
here
we
have
an
instinct
so
fundamental
so
imperious
that
its
influence
is
a
fact
which
has
to
be
accepted
suppress
it
you
can
not
you
may
guide
it
into
healthy
channels
but
an
outlet
it
will
have
and
if
that
outlet
is
inadequate
and
unduly
obstructed
irregular
channels
will
be
forced
the
attainment
of
mutual
and
reciprocal
joy
in
their
relations
constitutes
a
firm
bond
between
two
people
and
makes
for
durability
of
the
marriage
tie
reciprocity
in
sex
love
is
the
physical
counterpart
of
sympathy
more
marriages
fail
from
inadequate
and
clumsy
sex
love
than
from
too
much
sex
love
the
lack
of
proper
understanding
is
in
no
small
measure
responsible
for
the
unfulfillment
of
connubial
happiness
and
every
degree
of
discontent
and
unhappiness
may
from
this
cause
occur
leading
to
rupture
of
the
marriage
bond
itself
how
often
do
medical
men
have
to
deal
with
these
difficulties
and
how
fortunate
if
such
difficulties
are
disclosed
early
enough
in
married
life
to
be
rectified
otherwise
how
tragic
may
be
their
consequences
and
many
a
case
in
the
divorce
court
has
thus
had
its
origin
to
the
foregoing
contentions
it
might
be
objected
you
are
encouraging
passion
my
reply
would
be
passion
is
a
worthy
possession
most
men
who
are
any
good
are
capable
of
passion
you
all
enjoy
ardent
and
passionate
love
in
art
and
literature
why
not
give
it
a
place
in
real
life
why
some
people
look
askance
at
passion
is
because
they
are
confusing
it
with
sensuality
sex
love
without
passion
is
a
poor
lifeless
thing
sensuality
on
the
other
hand
is
on
a
level
with
gluttony
a
physical
excess
detached
from
sentiment
chivalry
or
tenderness
it
is
just
as
important
to
give
sex
love
its
place
as
to
avoid
its
its
real
and
effective
restraints
are
those
imposed
by
a
loving
and
sympathetic
companionship
by
the
privileges
of
parenthood
the
exacting
claims
of
career
and
that
civic
sense
which
prompts
men
to
do
social
service
now
that
the
revision
of
the
prayer
book
is
receiving
consideration
i
should
like
to
suggest
with
great
respect
an
addition
made
to
the
objects
of
marriage
in
the
marriage
service
in
these
terms
complete
realization
of
the
love
of
this
man
and
this
woman
the
one
for
the
other
turning
to
the
specific
problem
of
birth
control
lord
dawson
declared
that
birth
control
is
here
to
stay
it
is
an
established
fact
and
for
good
or
evil
has
to
be
accepted
although
the
extent
of
its
application
can
be
and
is
being
modified
no
denunciations
will
abolish
it
despite
the
influence
and
condemnations
of
the
church
it
has
been
practised
in
france
for
well
over
half
a
century
and
in
belgium
and
other
roman
catholic
countries
is
extending
and
if
the
roman
catholic
church
with
its
compact
organization
its
power
of
authority
and
its
disciplines
can
not
check
this
procedure
it
is
not
likely
that
protestant
churches
will
be
able
to
do
so
for
protestant
religions
depend
for
their
strength
on
the
conviction
and
esteem
they
establish
in
the
heads
and
hearts
of
their
people
the
reasons
which
lead
parents
to
limit
their
offspring
are
sometimes
selfish
but
more
often
honorable
and
cogent
a
report
of
the
fabian
society
on
the
morality
of
birth
control
based
upon
a
census
conducted
under
the
chairmanship
of
sidney
webb
concludes
these
facts
which
we
are
bound
to
face
whether
we
like
them
or
not
will
appear
in
different
lights
to
different
people
in
some
quarters
it
seems
to
be
sufficient
to
dismiss
them
with
moral
indignation
real
or
simulated
such
a
judgment
appears
both
irrelevant
and
futile
if
a
course
of
conduct
is
habitually
and
deliberately
pursued
by
vast
multitudes
of
otherwise
people
forming
probably
a
majority
of
the
whole
educated
class
of
the
nation
we
must
assume
that
it
does
not
conflict
with
their
actual
code
of
morality
they
may
be
intellectually
mistaken
but
they
are
not
doing
what
they
feel
to
be
wrong
the
moral
justification
and
ethical
necessity
of
birth
control
need
not
be
empirically
based
upon
the
mere
approval
of
experience
and
custom
its
morality
is
more
profound
birth
control
is
an
ethical
necessity
for
humanity
because
it
places
in
our
hands
a
new
instrument
of
and
it
gives
us
control
over
one
of
the
primordial
forces
of
nature
to
which
in
the
past
the
majority
of
mankind
have
been
enslaved
and
by
which
it
has
been
cheapened
and
debased
it
arouses
us
to
the
possibility
of
newer
and
greater
freedom
it
develops
the
power
the
responsibility
and
intelligence
to
use
this
freedom
in
living
a
liberated
and
abundant
life
it
permits
us
to
enjoy
this
liberty
without
danger
of
infringing
upon
the
similar
liberty
of
our
fellow
men
or
of
injuring
and
curtailing
the
freedom
of
the
next
generation
it
shows
us
that
we
need
not
seek
in
the
amassing
of
worldly
wealth
not
in
the
illusion
of
some
heaven
or
earthly
utopia
of
a
remote
future
the
road
to
human
development
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
in
a
very
definite
sense
within
us
not
by
leaving
our
body
and
our
fundamental
humanity
behind
us
not
by
aiming
to
be
anything
but
what
we
are
shall
we
become
ennobled
or
immortal
by
knowing
ourselves
by
expressing
ourselves
by
realizing
ourselves
more
completely
than
has
ever
before
been
possible
not
only
shall
we
attain
the
kingdom
ourselves
but
we
shall
hand
on
the
torch
of
life
undimmed
to
our
children
and
the
children
of
our
children

the
ally
there
is
but
one
hope
ignorance
poverty
and
vice
must
stop
populating
the
world
this
can
not
be
done
by
moral
suasion
this
can
not
be
done
by
talk
or
example
this
can
not
be
done
by
religion
or
by
law
by
priest
or
by
hangman
this
can
not
be
done
by
force
physical
or
moral
to
accomplish
this
there
is
but
one
way
science
must
make
woman
the
owner
the
mistress
of
herself
science
the
only
possible
savior
of
mankind
must
put
it
in
the
power
of
woman
to
decide
for
herself
whether
she
will
or
will
not
become
a
mother
robert

science
is
the
great
instrument
of
social
change
wrote
balfour
in
all
the
greater
because
its
object
is
not
change
but
knowledge
and
its
silent
appropriation
of
this
dominant
function
amid
the
din
of
religious
and
political
strife
is
the
most
vital
of
all
revolutions
which
have
marked
the
development
of
modern
civilization
the
birth
control
movement
has
allied
itself
with
science
and
no
small
part
of
its
present
propaganda
is
to
awaken
the
interest
of
scientists
to
the
pivotal
importance
to
civilization
of
this
instrument
only
with
the
aid
of
science
is
it
possible
to
perfect
a
practical
method
that
may
be
universally
taught
as
dean
inge
recently
admitted
we
should
be
ready
to
give
up
all
our
theories
if
science
proved
that
we
were
on
the
wrong
lines
one
of
the
principal
aims
of
the
american
birth
control
league
has
been
to
awaken
the
interest
of
scientific
investigators
and
to
point
out
the
rich
field
for
original
research
opened
up
by
this
problem
the
correlation
of
reckless
breeding
with
defective
and
delinquent
strains
has
not
strangely
enough
been
subjected
to
close
scientific
scrutiny
nor
has
the
present
biological
unbalance
been
traced
to
its
root
this
is
a
crying
necessity
of
our
day
and
it
can
not
be
accomplished
without
the
aid
of
science
secondary
only
to
the
response
of
women
themselves
is
the
awakened
interest
of
scientists
statisticians
and
research
workers
in
every
field
if
the
clergy
and
the
defenders
of
traditional
morality
have
opposed
the
movement
for
birth
control
the
response
of
enlightened
scientists
and
physicians
has
been
one
of
the
most
encouraging
aids
in
our
battle
recent
developments
in
the
realm
of
science
in
psychology
in
physiology
in
chemistry
and
physics
all
tend
to
emphasize
the
immediate
necessity
for
human
control
over
the
great
forces
of
nature
the
new
ideas
published
by
contemporary
science
are
of
the
utmost
fascination
and
illumination
even
to
the
layman
they
perform
the
invaluable
task
of
making
us
look
at
life
in
a
new
light
of
searching
close
at
hand
for
the
solution
to
heretofore
closed
mysteries
of
life
in
this
brief
chapter
i
can
touch
these
ideas
only
as
they
have
proved
valuable
to
me
professor
soddy
science
and
life
is
one
of
the
most
inspiring
of
recent
publications
in
this
field
for
this
great
authority
shows
us
how
closely
bound
up
is
science
with
the
whole
of
society
how
science
must
help
to
solve
the
great
and
disastrous
unbalance
in
human
society
as
an
example
a
whole
literature
has
sprung
into
being
around
the
glands
the
most
striking
being
the
sex
complex
by
blair
bell
this
author
advances
the
idea
of
the
glandular
system
as
an
integral
whole
the
glands
forming
a
unity
which
might
be
termed
the
generative
system
thus
is
reasserted
the
radical
importance
of
sexual
health
to
every
individual
the
whole
tendency
of
modern
physiology
and
psychology
in
a
word
seems
gradually
coming
to
the
truth
that
seemed
intuitively
to
be
revealed
to
that
great
woman
olive
schreiner
who
in
woman
and
labor
wrote
noble
is
the
function
of
physical
reproduction
of
humanity
by
the
union
of
man
and
woman
rightly
viewed
that
union
has
in
it
latent
other
and
even
higher
forms
of
creative
energy
and
power
and
its
history
on
earth
has
only
begun
as
the
first
wild
rose
when
it
hung
from
its
stem
with
its
center
of
stamens
and
pistils
and
its
single
whorl
of
pale
petals
had
only
begun
its
course
and
was
destined
as
the
ages
passed
to
develop
stamen
upon
stamen
and
petal
upon
petal
till
it
assumed
a
hundred
forms
of
joy
and
beauty
and
it
would
indeed
almost
seem
that
on
the
path
toward
the
higher
development
of
sexual
life
on
earth
as
man
has
so
often
had
to
lead
in
other
paths
that
here
it
is
perhaps
woman
by
reason
of
those
very
sexual
conditions
which
in
the
past
have
crushed
and
trammeled
her
who
is
bound
to
lead
the
way
and
man
to
follow
so
that
it
may
be
at
last
that
sexual
love
that
tired
angel
who
through
the
ages
has
presided
over
the
march
of
humanity
with
distraught
eyes
and
broken
and
wings
drabbled
in
the
mires
of
lust
and
greed
and
golden
locks
caked
over
with
the
dust
of
injustice
and
oppression
till
those
looking
at
him
have
sometimes
cried
in
terror
is
the
evil
and
not
the
good
of
life
and
have
sought
if
it
were
not
possible
to
exterminate
him
shall
yet
at
last
bathed
from
the
mire
and
dust
of
ages
in
the
streams
of
friendship
and
freedom
leap
upwards
with
white
wings
spread
resplendent
in
the
sunshine
of
a
distant
future
the
essentially
good
and
beautiful
of
human
existence
science
is
verifying
the
truth
of
this
inspiring
vision
certain
fundamental
truths
concerning
the
basic
facts
of
nature
and
humanity
especially
impress
us
a
rapid
survey
may
indicate
the
main
features
of
this
mysterious
identity
and
antagonism
mankind
has
gone
forward
by
the
capture
and
control
of
the
forces
of
nature
this
upward
struggle
began
with
the
kindling
of
the
first
fire
the
domestication
of
animal
life
marked
another
great
step
in
the
long
ascent
the
capture
of
the
great
physical
forces
the
discovery
of
coal
and
mineral
oil
of
gas
steam
and
electricity
and
their
adaptation
to
the
everyday
uses
of
mankind
wrought
the
greatest
changes
in
the
course
of
civilization
with
the
discovery
of
radium
and
radioactivity
with
the
recognition
of
the
vast
stores
of
physical
energy
concealed
in
the
atom
humanity
is
now
on
the
eve
of
a
new
conquest
but
on
the
other
side
humanity
has
been
compelled
to
combat
continuously
those
great
forces
of
nature
which
have
opposed
it
at
every
moment
of
this
long
indomitable
march
out
of
barbarism
humanity
has
had
to
wage
war
against
insects
germs
bacteria
which
have
spread
disease
and
epidemics
and
devastation
humanity
has
had
to
adapt
itself
to
those
natural
forces
it
could
not
conquer
but
could
only
adroitly
turn
to
its
own
ends
nevertheless
all
along
the
line
in
colonization
in
agriculture
in
medicine
and
in
industry
mankind
has
triumphed
over
nature
but
lest
the
recognition
of
this
victory
lead
us
to
and
complacency
we
should
never
forget
that
this
mastery
consists
to
a
great
extent
in
a
recognition
of
the
power
of
those
blind
forces
and
our
adroit
control
over
them
it
has
been
truly
said
that
we
attain
no
power
over
nature
until
we
learn
natural
laws
and
conform
and
adapt
ourselves
to
them
the
strength
of
the
human
race
has
been
its
ability
not
merely
to
subjugate
the
forces
of
nature
but
to
adapt
itself
to
those
it
could
not
conquer
and
even
this
subjugation
science
tells
us
has
not
resulted
from
any
attempt
to
suppress
prohibit
or
eradicate
these
forces
but
rather
to
transform
blind
and
undirected
energies
to
our
own
purposes
these
great
natural
forces
science
now
asserts
are
not
all
external
they
are
surely
concealed
within
the
complex
organism
of
the
human
being
no
less
than
outside
of
it
these
inner
forces
are
no
less
imperative
no
less
driving
and
compelling
than
the
external
forces
of
nature
as
the
old
conception
of
the
antagonism
between
body
and
soul
is
broken
down
as
psychology
becomes
an
ally
of
physiology
and
biology
and
biology
joins
hands
with
physics
and
chemistry
we
are
taught
to
see
that
there
is
a
mysterious
unity
between
these
inner
and
outer
forces
they
express
themselves
in
accordance
with
the
same
structural
physical
and
chemical
laws
the
development
of
civilization
in
the
subjective
world
in
the
sphere
of
behavior
conduct
and
morality
has
been
precisely
the
gradual
accumulation
and
popularization
of
methods
which
teach
people
how
to
direct
transform
and
transmute
the
driving
power
of
the
great
natural
forces
psychology
is
now
recognizing
the
forces
concealed
in
the
human
organism
in
the
long
process
of
adaptation
to
social
life
men
have
had
to
harness
the
wishes
and
desires
born
of
these
inner
energies
the
greatest
and
most
imperative
of
which
are
sex
and
hunger
from
the
beginning
of
time
men
have
been
driven
by
hunger
into
a
thousand
activities
it
is
hunger
that
has
created
the
struggle
for
existence
hunger
has
spurred
men
to
the
discovery
and
invention
of
methods
and
ways
of
avoiding
starvation
of
storing
and
exchanging
foods
it
has
developed
primitive
barter
into
our
contemporary
wall
streets
it
has
developed
thrift
and
economy
expedients
whereby
humanity
avoids
the
lash
of
king
hunger
the
true
economic
interpretation
of
history
might
be
termed
the
history
of
hunger
but
no
less
fundamental
no
less
imperative
no
less
ceaseless
in
its
dynamic
energy
has
been
the
great
force
of
sex
we
do
not
yet
know
the
intricate
but
certainly
organic
relationship
between
these
two
forces
it
is
obvious
that
they
oppose
yet
reinforce
each
other
driving
lashing
spurring
mankind
on
to
new
conquests
or
to
certain
ruin
perhaps
hunger
and
sex
are
merely
opposite
poles
of
a
single
great
life
force
in
the
past
we
have
made
the
mistake
of
separating
them
and
attempting
to
study
one
of
them
without
the
other
birth
control
emphasizes
the
need
of
and
of
knowledge
of
their
integral
relationship
and
aims
at
the
solution
of
the
great
problem
of
hunger
and
sex
at
one
and
the
same
time
in
the
more
recent
past
the
effort
has
been
made
to
control
civilize
and
sublimate
the
great
primordial
natural
force
of
sex
mainly
by
futile
efforts
at
prohibition
suppression
restraint
and
extirpation
its
revenge
as
the
psychoanalysts
are
showing
us
every
day
has
been
great
insanity
hysteria
neuroses
morbid
fears
and
compulsions
weaken
and
render
useless
and
unhappy
thousands
of
humans
who
are
unconscious
victims
of
the
attempt
to
pit
individual
powers
against
this
great
natural
force
in
the
solution
of
the
problem
of
sex
we
should
bear
in
mind
what
the
successful
method
of
humanity
has
been
in
its
conquest
or
rather
its
control
of
the
great
physical
and
chemical
forces
of
the
external
world
like
all
other
energy
that
of
sex
is
indestructible
by
adaptation
control
and
conscious
direction
we
may
transmute
and
sublimate
it
without
irreparable
injury
to
ourselves
we
can
not
attempt
to
eradicate
it
or
extirpate
it
the
study
of
atomic
energy
the
discovery
of
radioactivity
and
the
recognition
of
potential
and
latent
energies
stored
in
inanimate
matter
throw
a
brilliant
illumination
upon
the
whole
problem
of
sex
and
the
inner
energies
of
mankind
speaking
of
the
discovery
of
radium
professor
soddy
writes
tracked
to
earth
the
clew
to
a
great
secret
for
which
a
thousand
telescopes
might
have
swept
the
sky
forever
and
in
vain
lay
in
a
scrap
of
matter
dowered
with
something
of
the
same
inexhaustible
radiance
that
hitherto
has
been
the
sole
prerogative
of
the
distant
stars
and
sun
radium
this
distinguished
authority
tells
us
has
clothed
with
its
own
dignity
the
whole
empire
of
common
matter
much
as
the
atomic
theory
with
its
revelations
of
the
vast
treasure
house
of
radiant
energy
that
lies
all
about
us
offers
new
hope
in
the
material
world
so
the
new
psychology
throws
a
new
light
upon
human
energies
and
possibilities
of
individual
expression
social
reformers
like
those
scientists
of
a
bygone
era
who
were
sweeping
the
skies
with
their
telescopes
have
likewise
been
seeking
far
and
wide
for
the
solution
of
our
social
problems
in
remote
and
wholesale
panaceas
whereas
the
true
solution
is
close
at
hand
in
the
human
individual
buried
within
each
human
being
lies
concealed
a
vast
store
of
energy
which
awaits
release
expression
and
sublimation
the
individual
may
profitably
be
considered
as
the
atom
of
society
and
the
solution
of
the
problems
of
society
and
of
civilization
will
be
brought
about
when
we
release
the
energies
now
latent
and
undeveloped
in
the
individual
professor
edwin
grant
conklin
expresses
the
problem
in
another
form
though
his
analogy
it
seems
to
me
is
open
to
serious
criticism
the
freedom
of
the
individual
man
he
writes
is
to
that
of
society
as
the
freedom
of
the
single
cell
is
to
that
of
the
human
being
it
is
this
large
freedom
of
society
rather
than
the
freedom
of
the
individual
which
democracy
offers
to
the
world
free
societies
free
states
free
nations
rather
than
absolutely
free
individuals
in
all
organisms
and
in
all
social
organizations
the
freedom
of
the
minor
units
must
be
limited
in
order
that
the
larger
unit
may
achieve
a
new
and
greater
freedom
and
in
social
evolution
the
freedom
of
individuals
must
be
merged
more
and
more
into
the
larger
freedom
of
society
this
analogy
does
not
bear
analysis
restraint
and
constraint
of
individual
expression
suppression
of
individual
freedom
for
the
good
of
society
has
been
practised
from
time
immemorial
and
its
failure
is
all
too
evident
there
is
no
antagonism
between
the
good
of
the
individual
and
the
good
of
society
the
moment
civilization
is
wise
enough
to
remove
the
constraints
and
prohibitions
which
now
hinder
the
release
of
inner
energies
most
of
the
larger
evils
of
society
will
perish
of
inanition
and
malnutrition
remove
the
moral
taboos
that
now
bind
the
human
body
and
spirit
free
the
individual
from
the
slavery
of
tradition
remove
the
chains
of
fear
from
men
and
women
above
all
answer
their
unceasing
cries
for
knowledge
that
would
make
possible
their
and
salvation
and
in
so
doing
you
best
serve
the
interests
of
society
at
large
free
rational
and
personality
would
then
take
the
place
of
slaves
who
are
the
victims
both
of
external
constraints
and
the
playthings
of
the
uncontrolled
forces
of
their
own
instincts
science
likewise
illuminates
the
whole
problem
of
genius
hidden
in
the
common
stuff
of
humanity
lies
buried
this
power
of
modern
science
is
teaching
us
that
genius
is
not
some
mysterious
gift
of
the
gods
some
treasure
conferred
upon
individuals
chosen
by
chance
nor
is
it
as
lombroso
believed
the
result
of
a
pathological
and
degenerate
condition
allied
to
criminality
and
madness
rather
is
it
due
to
the
removal
of
physiological
and
psychological
inhibitions
and
constraints
which
makes
possible
the
release
and
the
channeling
of
the
primordial
inner
energies
of
man
into
full
and
divine
expression
the
removal
of
these
inhibitions
so
scientists
assure
us
makes
possible
more
rapid
and
profound
perceptions
so
rapid
indeed
that
they
seem
to
the
ordinary
human
being
practically
instantaneous
or
intuitive
the
qualities
of
genius
are
not
therefore
qualities
lacking
in
the
common
reservoir
of
humanity
but
rather
the
unimpeded
release
and
direction
of
powers
latent
in
all
of
us
this
process
of
course
is
not
necessarily
conscious
this
view
is
substantiated
by
the
opposite
problem
of
recent
researches
throw
a
new
light
on
this
problem
and
the
contrasting
one
of
human
genius
mental
defect
and
are
conceived
essentially
as
retardation
arrest
of
development
differing
in
degree
so
that
the
victim
is
either
an
idiot
an
imbecile
or
a
moron
according
to
the
relative
period
at
which
mental
development
ceases
scientific
research
into
the
functioning
of
the
ductless
glands
and
their
secretions
throws
a
new
light
on
this
problem
not
long
ago
these
glands
were
a
complete
enigma
owing
to
the
fact
that
they
are
not
provided
with
excretory
ducts
it
has
just
recently
been
shown
that
these
organs
such
as
the
thyroid
the
pituitary
the
suprarenal
the
parathyroid
and
the
reproductive
glands
exercise
an
influence
upon
the
course
of
individual
development
or
deficiency
gley
to
whom
we
owe
much
of
our
knowledge

of

are

by
the

of

of

let
psychologists
consider
these

these

or
endocrines
pass
directly
into
the

a

deficiency
in

thyroid
secretion
especially
during
the

of

and
early
childhood
creates
disorders
of

and
inactivity
of
the

the
particular
form
of
idiocy
known
as
cretinism
is
the
result
of
this
deficiency
which
produces
an
arrest
of
the
development
of
the
brain
cells
the
other
glands
and
their
secretions
likewise
exercise
the
most
profound
influence
upon
development
growth
and
assimilation
most
of
these
glands
are
of
very
small
size
none
of
them
larger
than
a
walnut
and
some
the
parathyroids
almost
microscopic
nevertheless
they
are
essential
to
the
proper
maintenance
of
life
in
the
body
and
no
less
organically
related
to
mental
and
psychic
development
as
well
the
reproductive
glands
it
should
not
be
forgotten
belong
to
this
group
and
besides
their
ordinary
products
the
germ
and
sperm
cells
ova
and
spermatozoa
form
hormones
which
circulate
in
the
blood
and
effect
changes
in
the
cells
of
distant
parts
of
the
body
through
these
hormones
the
secondary
sexual
characters
are
produced
including
the
many
differences
in
the
form
and
structure
of
the
body
which
are
the
characteristics
of
the
sexes
only
in
recent
years
has
science
discovered
that
these
secondary
sexual
characters
are
brought
about
by
the
agency
of
these
internal
secretions
or
hormones
passed
from
the
reproductive
glands
into
the
circulating
blood
these
secondary
characters
which
are
the
sign
of
full
and
healthy
development
are

science
tells
us
upon
the
state
of
development
of
the
reproductive
organs
for
a
clear
and
illuminating
account
of
the
creative
and
dynamic
power
of
the
endocrine
glands
the
layman
is
referred
to
a
recently
published
book
by
louis
berman
this
authority
reveals
anew
how
body
and
soul
are
bound
up
together
in
a
complex
unity
our
spiritual
and
psychic
difficulties
can
not
be
solved
until
we
have
mastered
the
knowledge
of
the
wellsprings
of
our
being
the
chemistry
of
the
soul
magnificent
phrase
exclaims
berman
it
a
long
long
way
to
that
goal
the
exact
formula
is
as
yet
far
beyond
our
reach
but
we
have
started
upon
the
long
journey
and
we
shall
get
there
the
internal
secretions
constitute
and
determine
much
of
the
inherited
powers
of
the
individual
and
their
development
they
control
physical
and
mental
growth
and
all
the
metabolic
processes
of
fundamental
importance
they
dominate
all
the
vital
functions
of
man
during
the
three
cycles
of
life
they
cooperate
in
an
intimate
relationship
which
may
be
compared
to
an
interlocking
directorate
a
derangement
of
their
functions
causing
an
insufficiency
of
them
an
excess
or
an
abnormality
upsets
the
entire
equilibrium
of
the
body
with
transforming
effects
upon
the
mind
and
the
organs
in
short
they
control
human
nature
and
whoever
controls
them
controls
human
nature
blood
chemistry
of
our
time
is
a
marvel
undreamed
of
a
generation
ago
also
these
achievements
are
a
perfect
example
of
the
accomplished
fact
contradicting
a
prior
prediction
and
criticism
for
it
was
one
of
the
accepted
dogmas
of
the
nineteenth
century
that
the
phenomena
of
living
could
never
be
subjected
to
accurate
quantitative
analysis
but
the
ethical
dogmas
of
the
past
no
less
than
the
scientific
may
block
the
way
to
true
civilization
physiologically
as
well
as
psychologically
the
development
of
the
human
being
the
sane
mind
in
the
sound
body
is
absolutely
dependent
upon
the
functioning
and
exercise
of
all
the
organs
in
the
body
the
moralists
who
preach
abstinence
and
suppression
are
relegated
by
these
findings
of
impartial
and
disinterested
science
to
the
class
of
those
educators
of
the
past
who
taught
that
it
was
improper
for
young
ladies
to
indulge
in
sports
and
athletics
and
who
produced
generations
of
feeble
undeveloped
invalids
bound
up
by
stays
and
addicted
to
swooning
and
hysterics
one
need
only
go
out
on
the
street
of
any
american
city
to
be
confronted
with
the
victims
of
the
cruel
morality
of
and
sin
this
fiendish
morality
is
stamped
upon
those
emaciated
bodies
indelibly
written
in
those
emasculated
underdeveloped
undernourished
figures
of
men
and
women
in
the
nervous
tension
and
unrelaxed
muscles
denoting
the
ceaseless
vigilance
in
restraining
and
suppressing
the
expression
of
natural
impulses
birth
control
is
no
negative
philosophy
concerned
solely
with
the
number
of
children
brought
into
this
world
it
is
not
merely
a
question
of
population
primarily
it
is
the
instrument
of
liberation
and
of
human
development
it
points
the
way
to
a
morality
in
which
sexual
expression
and
human
development
will
not
be
in
conflict
with
the
interest
and
of
the
race
nor
of
contemporary
society
at
large
not
only
is
it
the
most
effective
in
fact
the
only
lever
by
which
the
value
of
the
child
can
be
raised
to
a
civilized
point
but
it
is
likewise
the
only
method
by
which
the
life
of
the
individual
can
be
deepened
and
strengthened
by
which
an
inner
peace
and
security
and
beauty
may
be
substituted
for
the
inner
conflict
that
is
at
present
so
fatal
to
and
sublimation
of
the
sexual
instinct
can
not
take
place
by
denying
it
expression
nor
by
reducing
it
to
the
plane
of
the
purely
physiological
sexual
experience
to
be
of
contributory
value
must
be
integrated
and
assimilated
asceticism
defeats
its
own
purpose
because
it
develops
the
obsession
of
licentious
and
obscene
thoughts
the
victim
alternating
between
temporary
victory
over
sin
and
the
remorse
of
defeat
but
the
seeker
of
purely
physical
pleasure
the
libertine
or
the
average
sensualist
is
no
less
a
pathological
case
living
as
and
unbalanced
a
life
as
the
ascetic
for
his
conduct
is
likewise
based
on
ignorance
and
lack
of
understanding
in
seeking
pleasure
without
the
exercise
of
responsibility
in
trying
to
get
something
for
nothing
he
is
not
merely
cheating
others
but
himself
as
well
in
still
another
field
science
and
scientific
method
now
emphasize
the
pivotal
importance
of
birth
control
the
intelligence
tests
which
have
been
developed
expanded
and
applied
to
large
groups
of
children
and
adults
present
positive
statistical
data
concerning
the
mental
equipment
of
the
type
of
children
brought
into
the
world
under
the
influence
of
indiscriminate
fecundity
and
of
those
fortunate
children
who
have
been
brought
into
the
world
because
they
are
wanted
the
children
of
conscious
voluntary
procreation
well
nourished
properly
clothed
the
recipients
of
all
that
proper
care
and
love
can
accomplish
in
considering
the
data
furnished
by
these
intelligence
tests
we
should
remember
several
factors
that
should
be
taken
into
consideration
irrespective
of
other
considerations
children
who
are
underfed
undernourished
crowded
into
badly
ventilated
and
unsanitary
homes
and
chronically
hungry
can
not
be
expected
to
attain
the
mental
development
of
children
upon
whom
every
advantage
of
intelligent
and
scientific
care
is
bestowed
furthermore
public
school
methods
of
dealing
with
children
the
course
of
studies
prescribed
may
quite
completely
fail
to
awaken
and
develop
the
intelligence
the
statistics
indicate
at
any
rate
a
surprisingly
low
rate
of
intelligence
among
the
classes
in
which
large
families
and
uncontrolled
procreation
predominate
those
of
the
lowest
grade
in
intelligence
are
born
of
unskilled
laborers
with
the
highest
birth
rate
in
the
community
the
next
high
among
the
skilled
laborers
and
so
on
to
the
families
of
professional
people
among
whom
it
is
now
admitted
that
the
birth
rate
is
voluntarily
controlled
but
scientific
investigations
of
this
type
can
not
be
complete
until
statistics
are
accurately
obtained
concerning
the
relation
of
unrestrained
fecundity
and
the
quality
mental
and
physical
of
the
children
produced
the
philosophy
of
birth
control
therefore
seeks
and
asks
the
cooperation
of
science
and
scientists
not
to
strengthen
its
own
case
but
because
this
sexual
factor
in
the
determination
of
human
history
has
so
long
been
ignored
by
historians
and
scientists
if
science
in
recent
years
has
contributed
enormously
to
strengthen
the
conviction
of
all
intelligent
people
of
the
necessity
and
wisdom
of
birth
control
this
philosophy
in
its
turn
opens
to
science
in
its
various
fields
a
suggestive
avenue
of
approach
to
many
of

problems

us
the

strategic

reexamination

the
the

performing

invaluable
task
without

it

impossible
to
approach
any
fundamental
human
problem
failure
to
face
the
great
central
facts
of
sex
in
an
impartial
and
scientific
spirit
lies
at
the
root
of
the
blind
opposition
to
birth
control
our
bitterest
opponents
must
agree
that
the
problem
of
birth
control
is
one
of
the
most
important
that
humanity
has
to
face
the
interests
of
the
entire

of

of
the
future
of
mankind
itself
are
more
at
stake
in
this
than
wars
political
institutions
or
industrial
reorganization
all
other
projects
of
reform
of
revolution
or
reconstruction
are
of
secondary
importance
even
trivial
when
we
compare
them
to
the
wholesale
regeneration
or
disintegration
that
is
bound
up
with
the
control
the
direction
and
the
release
of
one
of
the
greatest
forces
in
nature
the
great
danger
at
present
does
not
lie
with
the
bitter
opponents
of
the
idea
of
birth
control
nor
with
those
who
are
attempting
to
suppress
our
program
of
enlightenment
and
education
such
opposition
is
always
stimulating
it
wins
new
adherents
it
reveals
its
own
weakness
and
lack
of
insight
the
greater
danger
is
to
be
found
in
the
flaccid
undiscriminating
interest
of
sympathizers
who
are
for
it
as
an
accessory
to
their
own
particular
panacea
it
even
seems
sometimes
wrote
the
late
william
graham
sumner
as
if
the
primitive
people
were
working
along
better
lines
of
effort
in
this
direction
than
we
are
when
our
public
organs
of
instruction
taboo
all
that
pertains
to
reproduction
as
improper
and
when
public
authority
ready
enough
to
interfere
with
personal
liberty
everywhere
else
feels
bound
to
act
as
if
there
were
no
societal
interest
at
stake
in
the
begetting
of
the
next
generation
slowly
but
surely
we
are
breaking
down
the
taboos
that
surround
sex
but
we
are
breaking
them
down
out
of
sheer
necessity
the
codes
that
have
surrounded
sexual
behavior
in
the
christian
communities
the
teachings
of
the
churches
concerning
chastity
and
sexual
purity
the
prohibitions
of
the
laws
and
the
hypocritical
conventions
of
society
have
all
demonstrated
their
failure
as
safeguards
against
the
chaos
produced
and
the
havoc
wrought
by
the
failure
to
recognize
sex
as
a
driving
force
in
human
nature
as
great
as
if
indeed
not
greater
than
hunger
its
dynamic
energy
is
indestructible
it
may
be
transmuted
refined
directed
even
sublimated
but
to
ignore
to
neglect
to
refuse
to
recognize
this
great
elemental
force
is
nothing
less
than
foolhardy
out
of
the
unchallenged
policies
of
continence
abstinence
chastity
and
purity
we
have
reaped
the
harvests
of
prostitution
venereal
scourges
and
innumerable
other
evils
traditional
moralists
have
failed
to
recognize
that
chastity
and
purity
must
be
the
outward
symptoms
of
awakened
intelligence
of
satisfied
desires
and
fulfilled
love
they
can
not
be
taught
by
sex
education
they
can
not
be
imposed
from
without
by
a
denial
of
the
might
and
the
right
of
sexual
expression
nevertheless
even
in
the
contemporary
teaching
of
sex
hygiene
and
social
prophylaxis
nothing
constructive
is
offered
to
young
men
and
young
women
who
seek
aid
through
the
trying
period
of
adolescence
at
the
lambeth
conference
of
the
bishops
of
the
church
of
england
stated
in
their
report
on
their
considerations
of
sexual
morality
men
should
regard
all
women
as
they
do
their
mothers
sisters
and
daughters
and
women
should
dress
only
in
such
a
manner
as
to
command
respect
from
every
man
all
persons
should
unite
in
the
suppression
of
pernicious
literature
plays
and
films
could
lack
of
psychological
insight
and
understanding
be
more
completely
indicated
yet
like
these
bishops
most
of
those
who
are
undertaking
the
education
of
the
young
are
as
ignorant
themselves
of
psychology
and
physiology
indeed
those
who
are
speaking
belatedly
of
the
need
of
sexual
hygiene
seem
to
be
unaware
that
they
themselves
are
most
in
need
of
it
we
must
give
up
the
futile
attempt
to
keep
young
people
in
the
dark
cries
rev
james
marchant
in
and
empire
and
the
assumption
that
they
are
ignorant
of
notorious
facts
we
can
not
if
we
would
stop
the
spread
of
sexual
knowledge
and
if
we
could
do
so
we
would
only
make
matters
infinitely
worse
this
is
the
second
decade
of
the
twentieth
century
not
the
early
victorian
period
it
is
no
longer
a
question
of
knowing
or
not
knowing
we
have
to
disabuse
our
minds
of
that
fond
delusion
our
young
people
know
more
than
we
did
when
we
began
our
married
lives
and
sometimes
as
much
as
we
know
ourselves
even
now
so
that
we
need
not
continue
to
shake
our
few
remaining
hairs
in
simulating
feelings
of
surprise
or
horror
it
might
have
been
better
for
us
if
we
had
been
more
enlightened
and
if
our
discussion
of
this
problem
is
to
be
of
any
real
use
we
must
at
the
outset
reconcile
ourselves
to
the
fact
that
the
is
voluntarily
controlled
certain
persons
who
instruct
us
in
these
matters
hold
up
their
pious
hands
and
whiten
their
frightened
faces
as
they
cry
out
in
the
public
squares
against
vice
but
they
can
only
make
themselves
ridiculous
taught
upon
the
basis
of
conventional
and
traditional
morality
and
respectability
based
on
current
dogma
and
handed
down
to
the
populace
with
benign
condescension
sex
education
is
a
waste
of
time
and
effort
such
education
can
not
in
any
true
sense
set
up
as
a
standard
the
ideal
morality
and
behavior
of
the
respectable
and
then
make
the
effort
to
induce
all
other
members
of
society
especially
the
working
classes
to
conform
to
their
taboos
such
a
method
is
not
only
confusing
but
in
the
creation
of
strain
and
hysteria
and
an
unhealthy
concentration
upon
moral
conduct
results
in
positive
injury
to
preach
a
negative
and
colorless
ideal
of
chastity
to
young
men
and
women
is
to
neglect
the
primary
duty
of
awakening
their
intelligence
their
responsibility
their
and
independence
once
this
is
accomplished
the
matter
of
chastity
will
take
care
of
itself
the
teaching
of
etiquette
must
be
superseded
by
the
teaching
of
hygiene
hygienic
habits
are
built
up
upon
a
sound
knowledge
of
bodily
needs
and
functions
it
is
only
in
the
sphere
of
sex
that
there
remains
an
unfounded
fear
of
presenting
without
the
gratuitous
introduction
of
taboos
and
prejudice
unbiased
and
unvarnished
facts
as
an
instrument
of
education
the
doctrine
of
birth
control
approaches
the
whole
problem
in
another
manner
instead
of
laying
down
hard
and
fast
laws
of
sexual
conduct
instead
of
attempting
to
inculcate
rules
and
regulations
of
pointing
out
the
rewards
of
virtue
and
the
penalties
of
sin
as
is
usually
attempted
in
relation
to
the
venereal
diseases
the
teacher
of
birth
control
seeks
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
people
upon
the
basis
of
their
interests
their
demands
their
problems
birth
control
education
attempts
to
develop
their
intelligence
and
show
them
how
they
may
help
themselves
how
to
guide
and
control
this
instinct
the
objection
has
been
raised
that
birth
control
only
reaches
the
already
enlightened
the
men
and
women
who
have
already
attained
a
degree
of
and
such
an
objection
could
not
be
based
on
fact
even
in
the
most
unenlightened
sections
of
the
community
among
mothers
crushed
by
poverty
and
economic
enslavement
there
is
the
realization
of
the
evils
of
the
family
of
the
rapid
succession
of
pregnancy
after
pregnancy
of
the
hopelessness
of
bringing
too
many
children
into
the
world
not
merely
in
the
evidence
presented
in
an
earlier
chapter
but
in
other
ways
is
this
crying
need
expressed
the
investigators
of
the
children
bureau
who
collected
the
data
of
the
infant
mortality
reports
noted
the
willingness
and
the
eagerness
with
which
these
mothers
told
the
truth
about
themselves
so
great
is
their
hope
of
relief
from
that
meaningless
and
deadening
submission
to
unproductive
reproduction
that
only
a
society
pruriently
devoted
to
hypocrisy
could
refuse
to
listen
to
the
voices
of
these
mothers
respectfully
we
lend
our
ears
to
dithyrambs
about
the
sacredness
of
motherhood
and
the
value
of
better
babies
but
we
shut
our
eyes
and
our
ears
to
the
unpleasant
reality
and
the
cries
of
pain
that
come
from
women
who
are
dying
by
the
thousands
because
this
power
is
withheld
from
them
this
situation
is
rendered
more
bitterly
ironic
because
the
opponents
of
birth
control
practise
themselves
the
doctrine
they
condemn
the
among
conservative
opponents
indicates
that
they
restrict
the
numbers
of
their
own
children
by
the
methods
of
birth
control
or
are
of
such
feeble
procreative
energy
as
to
be
thereby
unfitted
to
dictate
moral
laws
for
other
people
they
prefer
that
we
should
think
their
small
number
of
children
is
accidental
rather
than
publicly
admit
the
successful
practice
of
intelligent
foresight
or
else
they
hold
themselves
up
as
paragons
of
virtue
and
and
would
have
us
believe
that
they
have
brought
their
children
into
the
world
solely
from
a
high
stern
sense
of
public
duty
an
attitude
which
is
about
as
convincing
as
it
would
be
to
declare
that
they
found
them
under
gooseberry
bushes
how
else
can
we
explain
the
widespread
tolerance
and
smug
approval
of
the
clerical
idea
of
sex
now
reenforced
by
floods
of
crude
and
vulgar
sentiment
which
is
promulgated
by
the
press
and
popular
plays
like
all
other
education
that
of
sex
can
be
rendered
effective
and
valuable
only
as
it
meets
and
satisfies
the
interests
and
demands
of
the
pupil
himself
it
can
not
be
imposed
from
without
handed
down
from
above
superimposed
upon
the
intelligence
of
the
person
taught
it
must
find
a
response
within
him
give
him
the
power
and
the
instrument
wherewith
he
may
exercise
his
own
growing
intelligence
bring
into
action
his
own
judgment
and
discrimination
and
thus
contribute
to
the
growth
of
his
intelligence
the
civilized
world
is
coming
to
see
that
education
can
not
consist
merely
in
the
assimilation
of
external
information
and
knowledge
but
rather
in
the
awakening
and
development
of
innate
powers
of
discrimination
and
judgment
the
great
disaster
of
sex
education
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
fails
to
direct
the
awakened
interests
of
the
pupils
into
the
proper
channels
of
exercise
and
development
instead
it
blunts
them
restricts
them
hinders
them
and
even
attempts
to
eradicate
them
this
has
been
the
great
defect
of
sex
education
as
it
has
been
practised
in
recent
years
based
on
a
superficial
and
shameful
view
of
the
sexual
instinct
it
has
sought
the
inculcation
of
negative
virtues
by
pointing
out
the
sinister
penalties
of
promiscuity
and
by
advocating
strict
adherence
to
virtue
and
morality
not
on
the
basis
of
intelligence
or
the
outcome
of
experience
not
even
for
the
attainment
of
rewards
but
merely
to
avoid
punishment
in
the
form
of
painful
and
malignant
disease
education
so
conceived
carries
with
it
its
own
refutation
true
education
can
not
tolerate
the
inculcation
of
fear
fear
is
the
soil
in
which
are
implanted
inhibitions
and
morbid
compulsions
fear
restrains
restricts
hinders
human
expression
it
strikes
at
the
very
roots
of
joy
and
happiness
it
should
therefore
be
the
aim
of
sex
education
to
avoid
above
all
the
implanting
of
fear
in
the
mind
of
the
pupil
restriction
means
placing
in
the
hands
of
external
authority
the
power
over
behavior
birth
control
on
the
contrary
implies
voluntary
action
the
decision
for
one
self
how
many
children
one
shall
or
shall
not
bring
into
the
world
birth
control
is
educational
in
the
real
sense
of
the
word
in
that
it
asserts
this
power
of
decision
reinstates
this
power
in
the
people
themselves
we
are
not
seeking
to
introduce
new
restrictions
but
greater
freedom
as
far
as
sex
is
concerned
the
impulse
has
been
more
thoroughly
subject
to
restriction
than
any
other
human
instinct
thou
shalt
not
meets
us
at
every
turn
some
of
these
restrictions
are
justified
some
of
them
are
not
we
may
have
but
one
wife
or
one
husband
at
a
time
we
must
attain
a
certain
age
before
we
may
marry
children
born
out
of
wedlock
are
deemed
illegitimate
even
healthy
children
the
newspapers
every
day
are
filled
with
the
scandals
of
those
who
have
leaped
over
the
restrictions
or
limitations
society
has
written
in
her
sexual
code
yet
the
voluntary
control
of
the
procreative
powers
the
rational
regulation
of
the
number
of
children
we
bring
into
the
world
this
is
the
one
type
of
restriction
frowned
upon
and
prohibited
by
law
in
a
more
definite
a
much
more
realistic
and
concrete
manner
birth
control
reveals
itself
as
the
most
effective
weapon
in
the
spread
of
hygienic
and
prophylactic
knowledge
among
women
of
the
less
fortunate
classes
it
carries
with
it
a
thorough
training
in
bodily
cleanliness
and
physiology
a
definite
knowledge
of
the
physiology
and
function
of
sex
in
refusing
to
teach
both
sides
of
the
subject
in
failing
to
respond
to
the
universal
demand
among
women
for
such
instruction
and
information
maternity
centers
limit
their
own
efforts
and
fail
to
fulfil
what
should
be
their
true
mission
they
are
concerned
merely
with
pregnancy
maternity
the
problem
of
keeping
the
baby
alive
but
any
effective
work
in
this
field
must
go
further
back
we
have
gradually
come
to
see
as
havelock
ellis
has
pointed
out
that
comparatively
little
can
be
done
by
improving
merely
the
living
conditions
of
adults
that
improving
conditions
for
children
and
babies
is
not
enough
to
combat
the
evils
of
infant
mortality
natal
and
care
is
not
sufficient
even
to
improve
the
conditions
for
the
pregnant
woman
is
insufficient
necessarily
and
inevitably
we
are
led
further
and
further
back
to
the
point
of
procreation
beyond
that
into
the
regulation
of
sexual
selection
the
problem
becomes
a
circle
we
can
not
solve
one
part
of
it
without
a
consideration
of
the
entirety
but
it
is
especially
at
the
point
of
creation
where
all
the
various
forces
are
concentrated
conception
must
be
controlled
by
reason
by
intelligence
by
science
or
we
lose
control
of
all
its
consequences
birth
control
is
essentially
an
education
for
women
it
is
women
who
directly
and
by
their
very
nature
bear
the
burden
of
that
blindness
ignorance
and
lack
of
foresight
concerning
sex
which
is
now
enforced
by
law
and
custom
birth
control
places
in
the
hands
of
women
the
only
effective
instrument
whereby
they
may
reestablish
the
balance
in
society
and
assert
not
only
theoretically
but
practically
as
well
the
primary
importance
of
the
woman
and
the
child
in
civilization
birth
control
is
thus
the
stimulus
to
education
its
exercise
awakens
and
develops
the
sense
of
and
responsibility
and
illuminates
the
relation
of
the
individual
to
society
and
to
the
race
in
a
manner
that
otherwise
remains
vague
and
academic
it
reveals
sex
not
merely
as
an
untamed
and
insatiable
natural
force
to
which
men
and
women
must
submit
hopelessly
and
inertly
as
it
sweeps
through
them
and
then
accept
with
abject
humility
the
hopeless
and
heavy
consequences
instead
it
places
in
their
hands
the
power
to
control
this
great
force
to
use
it
to
direct
it
into
channels
in
which
it
becomes
the
energy
enhancing
their
lives
and
increasing
and
it
awakens
in
women
the
consciousness
of
new
glories
and
new
possibilities
in
motherhood
no
longer
the
prostrate
victim
of
the
blind
play
of
instinct
but
the
mistress
of
her
body
and
her
own
will
the
new
mother
finds
in
her
child
the
fulfilment
of
her
own
desires
in
free
instead
of
compulsory
motherhood
she
finds
the
avenue
of
her
own
development
and
expression
no
longer
bound
by
an
unending
series
of
pregnancies
at
liberty
to
safeguard
the
development
of
her
own
children
she
may
now
extend
her
beneficent
influence
beyond
her
own
home
in
becoming
thus
intensified
motherhood
may
also
broaden
and
become
more
extensive
as
well
the
mother
sees
that
the
welfare
of
her
own
children
is
bound
up
with
the
welfare
of
all
others
not
upon
the
basis
of
sentimental
charity
or
gratuitous
but
upon
that
of
enlightened
such
a
mother
may
exert
her
influence
among
the
less
fortunate
and
less
enlightened
unless
based
upon
this
central
knowledge
of
and
power
over
her
own
body
and
her
own
instincts
education
for
woman
is
valueless
as
long
as
she
remains
the
plaything
of
strong
uncontrolled
natural
forces
as
long
as
she
must
docilely
and
humbly
submit
to
the
decisions
of
others
how
can
woman
ever
lay
the
foundations
of
and
independence
how
can
she
make
her
own
choice
exercise
her
own
discrimination
her
own
foresight
in
the
exercise
of
these
powers
in
the
building
up
and
integration
of
her
own
experience
in
mastering
her
own
environment
the
true
education
of
woman
must
be
sought
and
in
the
sphere
of
sex
the
great
source
and
root
of
all
human
experience
it
is
upon
the
basis
of
birth
control
the
voluntary
direction
of
her
own
sexual
expression

i

a

before
her
and
held
in

hand
a

in

and
she
said

olive
schreiner
by
no
means
is
it
necessary
to
look
forward
to
some
vague
and
distant
date
of
the
future
to
test
the
benefits
which
the
human
race
derives
from
the
program
i
have
suggested
in
the
preceding
pages
the
results
to
the
individual
woman
to
the
family
and
to
the
state
particularly
in
the
case
of
holland
have
already
been
investigated
and
recorded
our
philosophy
is
no
doctrine
of
escape
from
the
immediate
and
pressing
realities
of
life
on
the
contrary
we
say
to
men
and
women
and
particularly
to
the
latter
face
the
realities
of
your
own
soul
and
body
know
thyself
and
in
this
last
admonition
we
mean
that
this
knowledge
should
not
consist
of
some
vague
shopworn
generalities
about
the
nature
of
woman
woman
as
created
in
the
minds
of
men
nor
woman
putting
herself
on
a
romantic
pedestal
above
the
harsh
facts
of
this
workaday
world
women
can
attain
freedom
only
by
concrete
definite
knowledge
of
themselves
a
knowledge
based
on
biology
physiology
and
psychology
nevertheless
it
would
be
wrong
to
shut
our
eyes
to
the
vision
of
a
world
of
free
men
and
women
a
world
which
would
more
closely
resemble
a
garden
than
the
present
jungle
of
chaotic
conflicts
and
fears
one
of
the
greatest
dangers
of
social
idealists
to
all
of
us
who
hope
to
make
a
better
world
is
to
seek
refuge
in
highly
colored
fantasies
of
the
future
rather
than
to
face
and
combat
the
bitter
and
evil
realities
which
on
all
sides
confront
us
i
believe
that
the
reader
of
my
preceding
chapters
will
not
accuse
me
of
shirking
these
realities
indeed
he
may
think
that
i
have
overemphasized
the
great
biological
problems
of
defect
delinquency
and
bad
breeding
it
is
in
the
hope
that
others
too
may
glimpse
my
vision
of
a
world
regenerated
that
i
submit
the
following
suggestions
they
are
based
on
the
belief
that
we
must
seek
individual
and
racial
health
not
by
great
political
or
social
reconstruction
but
turning
to
a
recognition
of
our
own
inherent
powers
and
development
by
the
release
of
our
inner
energies
it
is
thus
that
all
of
us
can
best
aid
in
making
of
this
world
instead
of
a
vale
of
tears
a
garden
let
us
first
of
all
consider
merely
from
the
viewpoint
of
business
and
efficiency
the
biological
or
racial
problems
which
confront
us
as
americans
we
have
of
late
made
much
of
efficiency
and
business
organization
yet
would
any
corporation
for
one
moment
conduct
its
affairs
as
we
conduct
the
infinitely
more
important
affairs
of
our
civilization
would
any
modern
stockbreeder
permit
the
deterioration
of
his
livestock
as
we
not
only
permit
but
positively
encourage
the
destruction
and
deterioration
of
the
most
precious
the
most
essential
elements
in
our
world
community
the
mothers
and
children
with
the
mothers
and
children
thus
cheapened
the
next
generation
of
men
and
women
is
inevitably
below
par
the
tendency
of
the
human
elements
under
present
conditions
is
constantly
downward
turn
to
robert
yerkes
psychological
examining
in
the
united
states
army
in
which
we
are
informed
that
the
psychological
examination
of
the
drafted
men
indicated
that
nearly
half
per
of
the
population
had
the
mentality
of
children
or
less
in
other
words
that
they
are
morons
professor
conklin
in
his
recently
published
volume
the
direction
of
human
evolution
is
led
on
the
findings
of
yerkes
report
to
assert
assuming
that
these
drafted
men
are
a
fair
sample
of
the
entire
population
of
approximately
this
means
that
or
nearly
the
entire
population
will
never
develop
mental
capacity
beyond
the
stage
represented
by
a
normal
child
and
that
only
will
ever
show
superior
intelligence
making
all
due
allowances
for
the
errors
and
discrepancies
of
the
psychological
examination
we
are
nevertheless
face
to
face
with
a
serious
and
destructive
practice
our
overhead
expense
in
segregating
the
delinquent
the
defective
and
the
dependent
in
prisons
asylums
and
permanent
homes
our
failure
to
segregate
morons
who
are
increasing
and
multiplying
i
have
sufficiently
indicated
though
in
truth
i
have
merely
scratched
the
surface
of
this
international
menace
demonstrate
our
foolhardy
and
extravagant
sentimentalism
no
industrial
corporation
could
maintain
its
existence
upon
such
a
foundation
yet
hardheaded
captains
of
industry
financiers
who
pride
themselves
upon
their
and
business
ability
are
dropping
millions
into
rosewater
philanthropies
and
charities
that
are
silly
at
best
and
vicious
at
worst
in
our
dealings
with
such
elements
there
is
a
bland
maladministration
and
misuse
of
huge
sums
that
should
in
all
righteousness
be
used
for
the
development
and
education
of
the
healthy
elements
of
the
community
at
the
present
time
civilized
nations
are
penalizing
talent
and
genius
the
bearers
of
the
torch
of
civilization
to
coddle
and
perpetuate
the
choking
human
undergrowth
which
as
all
authorities
tell
us
is
escaping
control
and
threatens
to
overrun
the
whole
garden
of
humanity
yet
men
continue
to
drug
themselves
with
the
opiate
of
optimism
or
sink
back
upon
the
cushions
of
christian
resignation
their
intellectual
powers
anaesthetized
by
cheerful
platitudes
or
else
even
those
who
are
fully
cognizant
of
the
chaos
and
conflict
seek
an
escape
in
those
pretentious
but
fundamentally
fallacious
social
philosophies
which
place
the
blame
for
contemporary
world
misery
upon
anybody
or
anything
except
the
indomitable
but
uncontrolled
instincts
of
living
organisms
these
men
fight
with
shadows
and
forget
the
realities
of
existence
too
many
centuries
have
we
sought
to
hide
from
the
inevitable
which
confronts
us
at
every
step
throughout
life
let
us
conceive
for
the
moment
at
least
a
world
not
burdened
by
the
weight
of
dependent
and
delinquent
classes
a
total
population
of
mature
intelligent
critical
and
expressive
men
and
women
instead
of
the
inert
exploitable
mentally
passive
class
which
now
forms
the
barren
substratum
of
our
civilization
try
to
imagine
a
population
active
resistant
passing
individual
and
social
lives
of
the
most
contented
and
healthy
sort
would
such
men
and
women
liberated
from
our
endless
unceasing
struggle
against
mass
prejudice
and
inertia
be
deprived
in
any
way
of
the
stimulating
zest
of
life
would
they
sink
into
a
slough
of
complacency
and
fatuity
no
life
for
them
would
be
enriched
intensified
and
ennobled
in
a
fashion
it
is
difficult
for
us
in
our
spiritual
and
physical
squalor
even
to
imagine
there
would
be
a
new
renaissance
of
the
arts
and
sciences
awakened
at
last
to
the
proximity
of
the
treasures
of
life
lying
all
about
them
the
children
of
that
age
would
be
inspired
by
a
spirit
of
adventure
and
romance
that
would
indeed
produce
a
terrestrial
paradise
let
us
look
forward
to
this
great
release
of
creative
and
constructive
energy
not
as
an
idle
vacuous
mirage
but
as
a
promise
which
we
as
the
whole
human
race
have
it
in
our
power
in
the
very
conduct
of
our
lives
from
day
to
day
to
transmute
into
a
glorious
reality
let
us
look
forward
to
that
era
perhaps
not
so
distant
as
we
believe
when
the
great
adventures
in
the
enchanted
realm
of
the
arts
and
sciences
may
no
longer
be
the
privilege
of
a
gifted
few
but
the
rightful
heritage
of
a
race
of
genius
in
such
a
world
men
and
women
would
no
longer
seek
escape
from
themselves
by
the
fantastic
and
the
faraway
they
would
be
awakened
to
the
realization
that
the
source
of
life
of
happiness
is
to
be
found
not
outside
themselves
but
within
in
the
healthful
exercise
of
their
functions
the
treasures
of
life
are
not
hidden
they
are
close
at
hand
so
close
that
we
overlook
them
we
cheat
ourselves
with
a
pitiful
fear
of
ourselves
men
and
women
of
the
future
will
not
seek
happiness
they
will
have
gone
beyond
it
mere
happiness
would
produce
monotony
and
their
lives
shall
be
lives
of
change
and
variety
with
the
thrills
produced
by
experiment
and
research
fear
will
have
been
abolished
first
of
all
the
fear
of
outside
things
and
other
people
finally
the
fear
of
oneself
and
with
these
fears
must
disappear
forever
all
those
poisons
of
hatreds
individual
and
international
for
the
realization
would
come
that
there
would
be
no
reason
for
no
value
in
encroaching
upon
the
freedom
of
one
another
we
are
living
in
a
world
which
is
like
a
forest
of
trees
too
thickly
planted
hence
the
ferocious
unending
struggle
for
existence
like
innumerable
ages
past
the
present
age
is
one
of
mutual
destruction
our
aim
is
to
substitute
cooperation
equity
and
amity
for
antagonism
and
conflict
if
the
aim
of
our
country
or
our
civilization
is
to
attain
a
hollow
meaningless
superiority
over
others
in
aggregate
wealth
and
population
it
may
be
sound
policy
to
shut
our
eyes
to
the
sacrifice
of
human
life
unregarded
life
and
suffering
and
to
stimulate
rapid
procreation
but
even
so
such
a
policy
is
bound
in
the
long
run
to
defeat
itself
as
the
decline
and
fall
of
great
civilizations
of
the
past
emphatically
indicate
even
the
bitterest
opponent
of
our
ideals
would
refuse
to
subscribe
to
a
philosophy
of
mere
quantity
of
wealth
and
population
lacking
in
spiritual
direction
or
significance
all
of
us
hope
for
and
look
forward
to
the
fine
flowering
of
human
genius
of
genius
not
expending
and
dissipating
its
energy
in
the
bitter
struggle
for
mere
existence
but
developing
to
a
fine
maturity
sustained
and
nourished
by
the
soil
of
active
appreciation
criticism
and
recognition
not
by
denying
the
central
and
basic
biological
facts
of
our
nature
not
by
subscribing
to
the
glittering
but
false
values
of
any
philosophy
or
program
of
escape
not
by
wild
utopian
dreams
of
the
brotherhood
of
men
not
by
any
sanctimonious
debauch
of
sentimentality
or
religiosity
may
we
accomplish
the
first
feeble
step
toward
liberation
on
the
contrary
only
by
firmly
planting
our
feet
on
the
solid
ground
of
scientific
fact
may
we
even
stand
erect
may
we
even
rise
from
the
servile
stooping
posture
of
the
slave
borne
down
by
the
weight
of
oppression
in
looking
forward
to
this
radiant
release
of
the
inner
energies
of
a
regenerated
humanity
i
am
not
thinking
merely
of
inventions
and
discoveries
and
the
application
of
these
to
the
perfecting
of
the
external
and
mechanical
details
of
social
life
this
external
and
scientific
perfecting
of
the
mechanism
of
external
life
is
a
phenomenon
we
are
to
a
great
extent
witnessing
today
but
in
a
deeper
sense
this
tendency
can
be
of
no
true
or
lasting
value
if
it
can
not
be
made
to
subserve
the
biological
and
spiritual
development
of
the
human
organism
individual
and
collective
our
great
problem
is
not
merely
to
perfect
machinery
to
produce
superb
ships
motor
cars
or
great
buildings
but
to
remodel
the
race
so
that
it
may
equal
the
amazing
progress
we
see
now
making
in
the
externals
of
life
we
must
first
free
our
bodies
from
disease
and
predisposition
to
disease
we
must
perfect
these
bodies
and
make
them
fine
instruments
of
the
mind
and
the
spirit
only
thus
when
the
body
becomes
an
aid
instead
of
a
hindrance
to
human
expression
may
we
attain
any
civilization
worthy
of
the
name
only
thus
may
we
create
our
bodies
a
fitting
temple
for
the
soul
which
is
nothing
but
a
vague
unreality
except
insofar
as
it
is
able
to
manifest
itself
in
the
beauty
of
the
concrete
once
we
have
accomplished
the
first
tentative
steps
toward
the
creation
of
a
real
civilization
the
task
of
freeing
the
spirit
of
mankind
from
the
bondage
of
ignorance
prejudice
and
mental
passivity
which
is
more
fettering
now
than
ever
in
the
history
of
humanity
will
be
facilitated
a
the
great
central
problem
and
one
which
must
be
taken
first
is
the
abolition
of
the
shame
and
fear
of
sex
we
must
teach
men
the
overwhelming
power
of
this
radiant
force
we
must
make
them
understand
that
uncontrolled
it
is
a
cruel
tyrant
but
that
controlled
and
directed
it
may
be
used
to
transmute
and
sublimate
the
everyday
world
into
a
realm
of
beauty
and
joy
through
sex
mankind
may
attain
the
great
spiritual
illumination
which
will
transform
the
world
which
will
light
up
the
only
path
to
an
earthly
paradise
so
must
we
necessarily
and
inevitably
conceive
of
the
instinct
is
here
none
of
us
can
avoid
it
it
is
in
our
power
to
make
it
a
thing
of
beauty
and
a
joy
forever
or
to
deny
it
as
have
the
ascetics
of
the
past
to
revile
this
expression
and
then
to
pay
the
penalty
the
bitter
penalty
that
society
is
paying
in
innumerable
ways
if
i
am
criticized
for
the
seeming
selfishness
of
this
conception
it
will
be
through
a
misunderstanding
the
individual
is
fulfiling
his
duty
to
society
as
a
whole
by
not
but
by
he
does
his
best
for
the
world
not
by
dying
for
it
not
by
increasing
the
sum
total
of
misery
disease
and
unhappiness
but
by
increasing
his
own
stature
by
releasing
a
greater
energy
by
being
active
instead
of
passive
creative
instead
of
destructive
this
is
fundamentally
the
greatest
truth
to
be
discovered
by
womankind
at
large
and
until
women
are
awakened
to
their
pivotal
function
in
the
creation
of
a
new
civilization
that
new
era
will
remain
an
impossible
and
fantastic
dream
the
new
civilization
can
become
a
glorious
reality
only
with
the
awakening
of
woman
now
dormant
qualities
of
strength
courage
and
vigor
as
a
great
thinker
of
the
last
century
pointed
out
not
only
to
her
own
health
and
happiness
is
the
physical
degeneracy
of
woman
destructive
but
to
our
whole
race
the
physical
and
psychic
power
of
woman
is
more
indispensable
to
the
and
power
of
the
human
race
than
that
even
of
man
for
the
strength
and
happiness
of
the
child
is
more
organically
united
with
that
of
the
mother
parallel
with
the
awakening
of
woman
interest
in
her
own
fundamental
nature
in
her
realization
that
her
greatest
duty
to
society
lies
in
will
come
a
greater
and
deeper
love
for
all
of
humanity
for
in
attaining
a
true
individuality
of
her
own
she
will
understand
that
we
are
all
individuals
that
each
human
being
is
essentially
implicated
in
every
question
or
problem
which
involves
the
of
the
humblest
of
us
so
we
are
not
to
meet
the
great
problems
of
defect
and
delinquency
in
any
merely
sentimental
or
superficial
manner
but
with
the
firmest
and
most
unflinching
attitude
toward
the
true
interest
of
our
fellow
beings
it
is
from
no
mere
feeling
of
brotherly
love
or
sentimental
philanthropy
that
we
women
must
insist
upon
enhancing
the
value
of
child
life
it
is
because
we
know
that
if
our
children
are
to
develop
to
their
full
capabilities
all
children
must
be
assured
a
similar
opportunity
every
single
case
of
inherited
defect
every
malformed
child
every
congenitally
tainted
human
being
brought
into
this
world
is
of
infinite
importance
to
that
poor
individual
but
it
is
of
scarcely
less
importance
to
the
rest
of
us
and
to
all
of
our
children
who
must
pay
in
one
way
or
another
for
these
biological
and
racial
mistakes
we
look
forward
in
our
vision
of
the
future
to
children
brought
into
the
world
because
they
are
desired
called
from
the
unknown
by
a
fearless
and
conscious
passion
because
women
and
men
need
children
to
complete
the
symmetry
of
their
own
development
no
less
than
to
perpetuate
the
race
they
shall
be
called
into
a
world
enhanced
and
made
beautiful
by
the
spirit
of
freedom
and
romance
into
a
world
wherein
the
creatures
of
our
new
day
unhampered
and
unbound
by
the
sinister
forces
of
prejudice
and
immovable
habit
may
work
out
their
own
destinies
perhaps
we
may
catch
fragmentary
glimpses
of
this
new
life
in
certain
societies
of
the
past
in
greece
perhaps
but
in
all
of
these
past
civilizations
these
happy
groups
formed
but
a
small
exclusive
section
of
the
population
our
task
is
greater
for
we
realize
that
no
section
of
humanity
can
be
reclaimed
without
the
regeneration
of
the
whole
i
look
therefore
into
a
future
when
men
and
women
will
not
dissipate
their
energy
in
the
vain
and
fruitless
search
for
content
outside
of
themselves
in
places
or
people
perfect
masters
of
their
own
inherent
powers
controlled
with
a
fine
understanding
of
the
art
of
life
and
of
love
adapting
themselves
with
pliancy
and
intelligence
to
the
milieu
in
which
they
find
themselves
they
will
unafraid
enjoy
life
to
the
utmost
women
will
for
the
first
time
in
the
unhappy
history
of
this
globe
establish
a
true
equilibrium
and
balance
of
power
in
the
relation
of
the
sexes
the
old
antagonism
will
have
disappeared
the
old
warfare
between
men
and
women
for
the
men
themselves
will
comprehend
that
in
this
cultivation
of
the
human
garden
they
will
be
rewarded
a
thousand
times
interest
in
the
vague
sentimental
fantasies
of
existence
in
pathological
or
hysterical
flights
from
the
realities
of
our
earthliness
will
have
through
atrophy
disappeared
for
in
that
dawn
men
and
women
will
have
come
to
the
realization
already
suggested
that
here
close
at
hand
is
our
paradise
our
everlasting
abode
our
heaven
and
our
eternity
not
by
leaving
it
and
our
essential
humanity
behind
us
nor
by
sighing
to
be
anything
but
what
we
are
shall
we
ever
become
ennobled
or
immortal
not
for
woman
only
but
for
all
of
humanity
is
this
the
field
where
we
must
seek
the
secret
of
eternal
life
memoirs
of
the
national
academy
of

volume
xv
conklin
the
direction
of
human
evolution
when
it
is
remembered
that
mental
capacity
is
inherited
that
parents
of
low
intelligence
generally
produce
children
of
low
intelligence
and
that
on
the
average
they
have
more
children
than
persons
of
high
intelligence
and
furthermore
when
we
consider
that
the
intellectual
capacity
or
age
can
be
changed
very
little
by
education
we
are
in
a
position
to
appreciate
the
very
serious
condition
which
confronts
us
as
a
nation
appendix
principles
and
aims
of
the
american
birth
control
league
principles
the
complex
problems
now
confronting
america
as
the
result
of
the
practice
of
reckless
procreation
are
fast
threatening
to
grow
beyond
human
control
everywhere
we
see
poverty
and
large
families
going
hand
in
hand
those
least
fit
to
carry
on
the
race
are
increasing
most
rapidly
people
who
can
not
support
their
own
offspring
are
encouraged
by
church
and
state
to
produce
large
families
many
of
the
children
thus
begotten
are
diseased
or
many
become
criminals
the
burden
of
supporting
these
unwanted
types
has
to
be
bourne
by
the
healthy
elements
of
the
nation
funds
that
should
be
used
to
raise
the
standard
of
our
civilization
are
diverted
to
the
maintenance
of
those
who
should
never
have
been
born
in
addition
to
this
grave
evil
we
witness
the
appalling
waste
of
health
and
women
lives
by
too
frequent
pregnancies
these
unwanted
pregnancies
often
provoke
the
crime
of
abortion
or
alternatively
multiply
the
number
of
and
lower
the
standard
of
living
to
create
a
race
of
well
born
children
it
is
essential
that
the
function
of
motherhood
should
be
elevated
to
a
position
of
dignity
and
this
is
impossible
as
long
as
conception
remains
a
matter
of
chance
we
hold
that
children
should
be
conceived
in
love
born
of
the
mother
conscious
desire
and
only
begotten
under
conditions
which
render
possible
the
heritage
of
health
therefore
we
hold
that
every
woman
must
possess
the
power
and
freedom
to
prevent
conception
except
when
these
conditions
can
be
satisfied
every
mother
must
realize
her
basic
position
in
human
society
she
must
be
conscious
of
her
responsibility
to
the
race
in
bringing
children
into
the
world
instead
of
being
a
blind
and
haphazard
consequence
of
uncontrolled
instinct
motherhood
must
be
made
the
responsible
and
means
of
human
expression
and
regeneration
these
purposes
which
are
of
fundamental
importance
to
the
whole
of
our
nation
and
to
the
future
of
mankind
can
only
be
attained
if
women
first
receive
practical
scientific
education
in
the
means
of

therefore
