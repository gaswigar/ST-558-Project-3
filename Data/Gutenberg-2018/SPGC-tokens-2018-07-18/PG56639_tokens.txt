december
dear
hannevig
at
last
as
you
see
my
journey
is
safely
accomplished
and
i
am
fairly
landed
in
the
midst
of
this
strange
socialistic
society
to
say
that
i
was
landed
is
to
make
use
of
so
obsolete
an
expression
that
it
must
entirely
fail
to
convey
to
you
a
true
idea
of
the
processes
of
the
journey
had
i
written
i
was
safely
into
the
country
this
would
much
more
graphically
describe
to
you
the
method
of
my
arrival
you
may
remember
perhaps
that
before
starting
i
found
myself
in
very
grave
doubt
as
to
which
route
to
take
whether
to
come
by
balloon
or
by
tunnel
as
the
latter
route
would
enable
me
to
enjoy
an
entirely
novel
spectacle
that
of
viewing
scenery
i
chose
and
wisely
i
now
know
to
come
by
the
pneumatic
tube
electric
company
the
comforts
and
luxuries
of
this
route
are
beyond
belief
the
perfection
of
the
contrivances
for
supplying
hot
and
cold
air
for
instance
during
the
journey
are
such
that
the
passengers
are
enabled
to
have
almost
any
temperature
at
command
the
cars
are
indeed
marked
and
one
buys
one
s
seat
according
to
his
taste
for
climate
many
of
the
travellers
i
noticed
booked
themselves
for
the
bath
department
remaining
the
entire
journey
in
the
turkish
russian
vapor
or
plunge
departments
as
the
various
baths
attached
to
this
line
surpass
a
roman
voluptuary
s
dream
of
such
luxuries
i
however
never
having
been
through
the
great
tunnel
before
was
naturally
more
interested
in
what
was
passing
so
swiftly
before
my
eyes
the
speed
at
which
we
were
shot
was
terrific
five
miles
to
the
minute
making
the
journey
of
three
thousand
miles
just
ten
hours
long
in
spite
of
the
swiftness
of
our
transit
we
were
enabled
by
the
aid
of
the
instantaneous
photographic
process
as
applied
to
and
telescopes
to
feel
that
we
lost
nothing
by
the
rapidity
of
our
passage
i
was
totally
unprepared
for
the
beauties
and
the
novelties
which
met
my
eye
at
every
turn
the
car
is
admirably
arranged
fancy
being
able
to
take
in
all
the
wonders
of
through
large
glass
in
the
concave
sides
of
circular
cars
the
tube
itself
which
is
of
iron
enormously
thick
has
glass
sides
also
of
huge
thickness
running
parallel
with
the
windows
of
the
car
so
that
the
view
is
unobstructed
the
sensations
awakened
therefore
both
by
the
novelty
of
the
situation
and
by
the
wonders
we
passed
in
review
combined
to
make
the
journey
thrillingly
exciting
we
were
swept
for
instance
past
armies
of
fishes
beautiful
to
behold
in
such
masses
shimmering
in
their
opalescent
armor
as
they
rose
above
or
sank
out
of
sight
into
the
depths
below
the
sudden
depressions
and
abrupt
elevations
of
the
made
the
scenery
full
of
diversity
there
was
a
great
abundance
of
color
with
the
vivid
crimson
of
the
coralline
plants
and
the
delicate
pinks
and
yellows
of
the
many
varieties
of
the
flora
it
seemed
at
times
as
if
we
were
caught
in
a
liquid
cloud
of
amber
or
were
to
be
enmeshed
in
a
grove
of
giant
beyond
all
else
however
in
point
of
interest
was
the
spectacle
of
the
wholesale
cannibalism
going
on
among
the
finny
tribes
a
cannibalism
which
still
exists
in
spite
of
the
persistent
and
unwearying
exertions
of
the
numerous
societies
for
the
prevention
of
cruelty
among
cetacea
and
crustacea
we
passed
any
number
of
small
boats
darting
in
and
out
among
the
porpoises
dolphins
and
smaller
fish
delivering
supplies
of
proper
christian
food
and
punishing
offenders
a
missionary
who
chanced
to
sit
next
to
me
told
me
that
of
all
vertebrate
or
invertebrate
animals
the
fish
is
the
least
amenable
to
reformatory
discipline
fishes
appear
to
have
been
born
he
went
on
to
say
without
the
most
rudimentary
form
of
the
moral
instinct
and
curiously
enough
only
flourish
in
proportion
as
they
are
allowed
to
act
out
their
original
degenerate
nature
he
also
confessed
privately
to
me
that
after
some
years
active
work
among
them
the
results
of
his
labors
were
most
discouraging
since
however
the
buddhistic
doctrine
of
metempsychosis
has
come
to
be
so
universally
accepted
and
as
each
one
of
these
poor
creatures
is
in
reality
a
soul
in
embryo
it
behoves
mankind
to
do
all
that
lies
in
its
power
to
elevate
all
tribes
and
species
as
you
may
well
imagine
my
dear
hannevig
with
such
spectacles
and
speculations
to
enliven
the
journey
i
found
it
all
too
short
its
shortness
was
in
truth
the
only
drawback
to
my
complete
enjoyment
the
wonders
of
the
journey
i
found
were
however
only
a
fitting
prelude
to
the
surprises
that
awaited
me
on
my
arrival
i
leave
an
account
of
both
these
surprises
and
of
my
first
impressions
of
the
great
city
until
my
next
letter
as
this
one
i
find
has
already
grown
to
the
proportions
of
an
ancient
epistle
i
am
my
dear
hannevig
your
friend
and
comrade
wolfgang
ii
dear
hannevig
the
three
days
time
which
has
elapsed
since
my
last
letter
to
you
has
been
so
crowded
with
a
confusion
of
bewildered
impressions
produced
by
this
astonishing
city
and
its
still
more
astonishing
inhabitants
that
i
am
in
doubt
whether
i
shall
be
able
to
convey
to
you
any
clearer
pictures
than
those
which
fill
the
disordered
canvas
of
my
own
mind
i
will
however
strive
to
reproduce
my
experiences
in
the
order
in
which
they
came
to
me
and
allow
you
to
draw
your
own
conclusions
the
first
amazing
thing
that
happened
to
me
was
the
way
in
which
i
reached
my
hotel
fancy
being
blown
up
on
the
shore
for
the
pneumatic
tube
being
many
hundreds
of
feet
below
the
shore
level
we
were
literally
blown
up
on
the
beach
there
we
found
omnibuses
into
which
we
and
our
luggage
were
transported
by
means
of
little
electrical
cars
running
on
an
inclined
plane
the
balloon
rose
about
a
thousand
feet
into
the
air
affording
a
fine
view
of
the
city
great
is
not
a
large
enough
word
to
describe
so
vast
a
city
as
this
city
of
the
socialists
it
has
the
immensity
of
an
unending
plain
and
the
flatness
of
one
also
in
former
times
i
believe
the
original
city
was
an
island
on
either
side
of
which
flowed
a
river
but
as
more
and
more
land
became
necessary
new
channels
for
these
rivers
were
dug
and
the
filled
in
so
that
now
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
there
is
a
limitless
expanse
of
as
seen
from
an
aerial
elevation
there
was
nothing
to
attract
the
eye
from
the
picturesque
standpoint
there
were
few
large
buildings
of
noticeable
size
or
beauty
the
city
was
chiefly
remarkable
because
of
its
immensity
when
landed
at
my
hotel
i
found
these
first
impressions
confirmed
by
a
nearer
view
first
let
me
tell
you
however
that
after
entering
the
vestibule
of
the
hotel
i
felt
as
if
i
had
stepped
into
some
dwelling
of
gnomes
or
sprites
not
a
human
being
presented
himself
no
one
appeared
to
take
my
luggage
nor
was
a
clerk
or
hall
boy
visible
anywhere
the
great
hall
of
the
hotel
was
as
deserted
and
silent
as
an
empty
tomb
at
first
i
could
not
even
discover
a
bell
presently
however
i
saw
a
huge
iron
hand
pointing
to
an
adjacent
table
on
the
table
lay
a
big
book
with
a
placard
on
which
was
printed
write
name
country
length
of
stay
and
number
of
rooms
all
of
which
i
did
the
book
then
miraculously
closed
itself
and
disappeared
the
next
instant
a
tray
made
its
appearance
where
the
book
had
been
on
the
tray
was
a
key
and
on
the
key
a
tag
with
a
number
and
the
words
elevator
at
your
left
to
third
the
elevator
as
i
stepped
into
it
stopped
as
if
by
magic
at
the
third
story
when
another
iron
hand
shot
out
of
the
wall
pointing
me
to
the
left
soon
i
found
the
room
assigned
me
opened
it
and
entered
to
discover
the
apartment
in
complete
order
and
the
faucets
in
the
actually
turned
on
my
dear
hannevig
can
you
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
that
i
have
been
in
this
hotel
four
mortal
days
have
eaten
three
substantial
meals
a
day
have
been
fairly
comfortable
and
yet
have
not
seen
a
human
creature
from
a
landlord
to
a
servant
the
whole
establishment
apparently
is
run
by
machinery
there
is
a
complicated
bell
apparatus
which
you
ring
for
every
conceivable
want
or
need
meals
are
served
in
one
s
own
room
by
a
system
of
ingenious
sliding
shelves
which
open
and
shut
and
disappear
into
the
wall
in
the
most
manner
of
course
the
reason
of
all
these
contrivances
is
obvious
enough
in
a
society
where
labor
of
a
degrading
order
is
forbidden
by
law
machinery
must
be
used
as
its
substitute
it
is
all
well
enough
i
presume
from
the
laborer
s
point
of
view
but
for
a
traveller
bent
on
a
pleasure
trip
machinery
as
a
substitute
for
a
garrulous
landlord
and
a
score
of
servants
however
bad
is
found
to
be
a
poor
and
somewhat
monotonous
companion
i
amuse
myself
however
with
perpetually
testing
all
the
bells
and
the
electrical
apparatus
calling
for
a
hundred
things
i
don
t
want
to
see
whether
they
will
come
through
the
ceiling
or
up
the
floor
most
of
my
time
however
is
spent
in
the
streets
my
earlier
impressions
of
the
city
i
find
remain
unchanged
it
is
as
flat
as
your
hand
and
as
monotonous
as
a
tale
never
was
there
such
monotony
or
such
dulness
each
house
is
precisely
like
its
neighbor
each
house
has
so
many
rooms
so
many
windows
so
many
square
feet
of
garden
which
latter
no
one
cultivates
as
flowers
and
grass
entail
a
certain
amount
of
manual
labor
which
it
appears
is
thought
to
be
degrading
by
these
socialists
imagine
therefore
miles
upon
miles
of
a
city
composed
of
little
houses
as
like
one
unto
another
as
two
brown
nuts
there
are
parks
and
theatres
and
museums
and
libraries
the
peoples
clubs
and
innumerable
state
buildings
but
these
are
all
architecturally
tasteless
as
utility
has
been
the
only
feature
considered
in
their
construction
every
thing
here
from
the
laying
out
of
the
city
to
the
last
detail
concerning
the
affairs
of
commerce
or
trade
is
arranged
according
to
the
socialistic
principle
by
the
people
for
the
people
the
city
itself
was
rebuilt
a
hundred
years
ago
in
order
that
the
houses
and
the
public
buildings
might
be
in
more
fitting
harmony
with
the
new
order
and
principles
of
socialism
what
the
older
city
of
new
york
may
have
been
it
is
difficult
to
determine
although
it
is
supposed
to
have
been
ugly
enough
but
this
modern
city
is
the
very
acme
of
dreariness
it
is
the
monotony
i
think
which
chiefly
depresses
me
it
is
not
that
the
houses
do
not
seem
comfortable
clean
and
orderly
for
all
these
virtues
they
possess
but
fancy
seeing
miles
upon
miles
of
little
houses
the
total
lack
of
contrast
which
is
the
result
of
the
plan
on
which
this
socialistic
city
has
been
built
comes
of
course
from
the
principle
which
has
decreed
that
no
man
can
have
any
finer
house
or
better
interior
or
finer
clothes
than
his
neighbor
the
abolition
of
poverty
and
the
raising
of
all
classes
to
a
common
level
of
comfort
and
security
has
resulted
in
the
most
deadening
uniformity
take
for
example
the
aspect
of
the
shop
windows
all
shops
are
run
by
the
government
on
government
capital
there
is
consequently
neither
rivalry
nor
competition
the
shop
keepers
who
are
in
reality
only
clerks
and
salesmen
under
government
jurisdiction
take
naturally
no
personal
or
vital
interest
either
in
the
amount
of
goods
sold
or
in
the
way
in
which
these
latter
are
placed
before
the
public
the
therefore
are
as
uninviting
as
are
the
goods
displayed
only
useful
necessary
objects
and
articles
are
to
be
seen
the
eye
seeks
in
vain
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
city
for
any
thing
really
beautiful
for
the
lovely
or
the
rare
objects
of
art
and
of
beauty
find
it
seems
no
market
here
occasionally
the
government
makes
a
purchase
of
some
foreign
work
of
art
or
seizes
on
some
of
those
recently
excavated
from
the
ruins
of
some
century
merchant
s
palace
the
picture
or
vase
is
then
placed
in
the
museums
where
the
people
are
supposed
to
enjoy
its
possession
to
connect
the
word
enjoyment
with
the
aspect
of
these
serious
socialists
is
almost
laughable
a
more
sober
collection
of
people
i
never
beheld
they
are
as
solemn
as
the
oldest
and
wisest
of
owls
they
have
the
look
of
people
who
have
come
to
the
end
of
things
and
who
have
failed
to
find
it
amusing
the
entire
population
appear
to
be
eternally
in
the
streets
wandering
up
and
down
with
their
hands
in
their
pockets
on
the
lookout
for
something
that
never
happens
what
indeed
is
there
to
happen
have
they
not
come
to
the
consummation
of
everything
of
their
dreams
and
their
hopes
and
desires
a
man
can
t
have
his
dream
and
dream
it
too
realization
has
been
found
before
now
to
be
exceedingly
dull
play
as
it
is
i
am
free
to
confess
that
the
dulness
and
apathy
of
these
socialists
weighs
on
me
my
views
of
their
condition
may
change
when
i
come
to
know
them
better
it
is
late
and
i
must
close
ever
yours
iii
curiously
enough
my
dear
fellow
the
very
next
day
after
dispatching
my
last
i
found
my
self
involved
in
a
long
and
most
interesting
conversation
with
the
daughter
of
one
of
the
city
residents
i
had
brought
letters
of
introduction
to
a
certain
gentleman
and
after
a
search
of
some
hours
through
the
eternal
labyrinth
of
these
unending
streets
found
the
house
to
which
i
had
been
directed
the
gentleman
or
rather
citizen
as
all
men
are
called
here
was
not
at
home
i
was
however
received
by
his
daughter
a
plain
but
seemingly
agreeable
intelligent
young
woman
the
women
dress
so
exactly
like
the
men
in
this
country
that
it
is
somewhat
difficult
to
tell
the
sexes
apart
women
however
usually
betray
themselves
as
soon
as
they
speak
by
their
voices
this
young
lady
had
an
unusually
pleasant
voice
and
manner
and
we
were
soon
deep
in
the
agreeable
intricacies
of
a
lengthy
conversation
i
had
any
number
of
questions
to
ask
and
she
appeared
to
be
most
willing
to
answer
them
my
first
question
i
remember
was
an
eminently
practical
one
it
was
on
the
subject
of
chimneys
and
cooking
i
had
noticed
almost
immediately
on
my
arrival
that
throughout
the
entire
city
not
a
chimney
was
to
be
seen
it
was
this
fact
more
than
any
other
that
gave
the
city
the
appearance
of
a
plain
and
made
the
houses
seem
curiously
deformed
it
naturally
followed
that
there
being
no
chimneys
there
was
also
no
smoke
which
therefore
made
this
already
sufficiently
clear
atmosphere
as
pure
as
the
air
on
a
all
very
beautiful
i
said
to
myself
but
how
do
the
people
get
along
without
cooking
i
in
my
quality
of
stranger
and
foreigner
had
made
the
interesting
discovery
that
my
own
meals
were
prepared
to
my
taste
by
specially
appointed
state
cooks
a
law
only
recently
passed
to
facilitate
international
relations
the
latter
it
appears
had
become
somewhat
strained
when
travelers
had
found
themselves
forced
to
abide
by
the
rules
and
regulations
governing
the
socialists
diet
but
what
was
this
diet
this
was
the
mystery
which
had
been
puzzling
me
ever
since
my
arrival
when
therefore
i
found
myself
face
to
face
with
my
young
lady
i
promptly
implored
her
to
solve
my
dilemma
oh
she
replied
cooking
has
gone
out
long
ago
to
do
any
cooking
is
considered
dreadfully
has
eating
also
gone
out
of
fashion
in
this
wonderful
country
i
asked
in
amazement
she
laughed
as
she
replied
eating
hasn
t
but
we
do
it
in
a
more
refined
way
instead
of
kitchens
we
now
have
conduits
culinary
culinary
conduits
i
asked
still
in
a
daze
of
wonderment
oh
i
see
you
don
t
understand
she
answered
you
haven
t
been
here
long
enough
to
know
how
such
things
are
arranged
let
me
explain
the
state
scientists
now
regulate
all
such
matters
once
a
month
our
officer
of
hygiene
comes
and
examines
each
member
of
the
household
he
then
prescribes
the
kind
of
food
he
thinks
you
require
for
the
next
few
weeks
whether
it
shall
be
more
or
less
phosphates
or
cereals
or
carnivorous
preparations
he
leaves
a
paper
with
you
you
then
touch
this
spring
see
and
here
she
put
her
pretty
white
finger
on
a
button
in
the
wall
you
whistle
through
the
aperture
to
the
culinary
board
put
in
the
paper
and
it
is
sent
to
the
main
office
you
then
receive
supplies
for
the
ensuing
and
where
is
this
wonderful
board
it
is
in
chicago
where
all
the
great
granaries
are
you
know
chicago
supplies
the
food
for
the
entire
united
but
chicago
is
a
thousand
miles
off
isn
t
all
the
food
stale
by
the
time
it
reaches
you
here
she
laughed
although
i
could
see
she
tried
very
hard
not
to
do
so
but
my
ignorance
was
evidently
too
amazingly
funny
when
she
had
regained
composure
she
answered
the
food
is
sent
to
us
by
electricity
through
the
culinary
conduits
every
thing
is
blown
to
us
in
a
few
minutes
time
if
it
be
necessary
if
the
food
is
to
be
eaten
hot
if
the
food
be
cereals
or
condensed
meats
it
is
sent
by
pneumatic
express
done
up
in
bottles
or
in
pellets
all
such
food
is
carried
about
in
one
s
pocket
we
take
our
food
as
we
drink
water
wherever
we
may
happen
to
be
when
it
s
handy
and
when
we
need
it
although
she
added
with
a
sigh
i
sometimes
do
wish
i
had
lived
in
the
good
old
times
in
the
nineteenth
century
for
instance
when
such
dear
customs
were
in
vogue
as
having
dinners
and
the
ladies
were
taken
into
dinner
by
the
gentlemen
and
every
one
wore
full
dress
the
dress
of
the
period
and
they
used
to
flirt
wasn
t
that
the
old
word
over
their
wine
and
dessert
how
changed
every
thing
is
now
however
she
quickly
added
if
kitchens
and
cooking
and
long
dinners
hadn
t
been
abolished
the
final
emancipation
of
women
could
never
have
been
accomplished
the
perfecting
of
the
woman
movement
was
retarded
for
hundreds
of
years
as
you
know
doubtless
by
the
slavish
desire
of
women
to
please
their
husbands
by
dressing
and
cooking
to
suit
them
when
the
last
pie
was
made
into
the
first
pellet
woman
s
true
freedom
began
she
could
then
cast
off
her
subordination
both
to
her
husband
and
to
her
servants
women
were
only
free
indeed
when
the
state
prohibited
the
hiring
of
servants
of
course
the
hiring
of
servants
at
all
was
as
degrading
to
the
oppressed
class
as
it
was
a
clog
to
the
progress
of
their
mistresses
freedom
the
only
way
to
raise
the
race
was
to
put
every
one
on
the
same
level
to
make
even
degrees
of
servitude
but
how
may
i
be
permitted
to
ask
is
the
rest
of
the
housework
accomplished
if
no
servants
exist
to
take
charge
of
so
pretty
a
house
as
this
one
the
house
my
dear
hannevig
was
in
reality
hideous
as
bare
and
as
plain
as
are
all
the
houses
here
each
is
furnished
by
state
law
exactly
alike
oh
every
thing
is
done
by
machinery
as
at
your
hotel
every
thing
the
sweeping
bed
making
window
scrubbing
and
washing
each
separate
department
has
its
various
appliances
and
apparatus
the
women
of
every
household
are
taught
the
use
and
management
of
the
various
machines
you
know
at
the
expense
of
the
state
during
their
youth
when
they
take
the
management
of
a
house
they
can
run
it
most
of
the
machinery
goes
by
electricity
a
house
can
be
kept
in
perfect
order
by
two
hours
work
daily
the
only
hard
work
which
we
still
have
to
do
is
dusting
no
invention
has
yet
been
effected
which
dusts
satisfactorily
without
breakage
to
ornaments
which
accounts
for
the
fact
also
that
the
fashion
of
having
odds
and
ends
about
a
home
has
gone
out
it
was
voted
years
ago
by
the
largest
women
s
vote
ever
polled
that
since
men
could
not
invent
dusters
their
homes
must
suffer
women
were
not
to
be
degraded
to
hand
machines
for
the
sake
of
ministering
to
men
s
æsthetic
tastes
so
you
see
we
have
only
the
necessary
chairs
and
tables
if
men
want
to
see
pictures
they
can
go
to
the
perhaps
it
is
this
latter
fact
which
accounts
for
my
never
being
able
to
find
the
good
citizen
a
at
home
he
is
gone
to
the
public
club
or
to
the
bath
or
to
the
communal
theater
i
am
told
when
i
appear
again
and
again
this
wonderful
community
has
done
much
of
that
i
am
convinced
in
the
development
of
ideal
freedom
but
there
appears
to
be
a
fatal
blight
somewhere
in
its
principles
a
blight
which
seems
to
have
destroyed
all
delight
in
domestic
life
in
my
next
i
will
tell
you
more
and
at
length
of
the
peculiar
development
which
the
race
has
attained
under
these
now
emancipation
doctrines
and
of
their
results
on
the
two
sexes
i
hope
you
are
not
wearying
of
my
somewhat
lengthy
descriptions
but
you
yourself
are
to
blame
as
you
bound
me
to
such
rigid
promises
of
detail
and
accuracy
farewell
dear
companion
would
you
were
here
to
use
your
wiser
philosopher
s
eyes
i
am
yours
wolfgang
iv
dear
friend
no
one
thing
i
think
strikes
the
foreigners
eye
on
his
arrival
in
this
extraordinary
land
so
strongly
as
does
the
lack
of
variety
and
of
taste
displayed
in
the
dress
of
either
the
men
or
the
women
both
sexes
dress
to
begin
with
as
i
said
in
my
last
precisely
alike
as
it
is
one
of
the
unwritten
social
laws
of
the
people
to
dress
as
simply
economically
and
sensibly
as
possible
it
results
that
there
is
neither
brightness
nor
color
nor
beauty
of
line
in
any
of
the
garments
worn
in
passing
the
government
clothing
distribution
bureaus
nothing
so
forcibly
suggests
the
ideal
equality
existing
between
the
sexes
as
does
the
sight
of
the
big
and
the
little
trowsers
hanging
side
by
side
quite
unabashed
the
straight
and
the
baggy
legs
being
the
only
discernible
difference
baggy
trowsers
and
a
somewhat
long
full
cloak
for
the
women
trowsers
and
a
shorter
coat
for
the
men
this
is
the
dress
of
the
entire
population
some
of
the
women
are
still
pretty
in
spite
of
their
hideous
clothes
but
they
all
tell
me
they
wouldn
t
be
if
they
could
help
it
as
they
hold
that
the
beauty
of
their
sex
was
the
chief
cause
of
their
former
slavery
they
consider
comeliness
now
as
a
brand
and
mark
of
which
to
be
ashamed
from
what
i
have
been
able
to
observe
however
i
should
say
that
the
prettiness
which
has
descended
to
some
of
the
women
fails
to
awaken
any
sentiment
or
gallantry
on
the
part
of
the
men
there
has
i
learn
been
a
gradual
decay
of
the
erotic
sentiment
which
doubtless
accounts
for
the
indifference
among
the
men
a
decay
which
is
due
to
the
peculiar
relations
brought
about
by
the
emancipation
of
woman
it
is
now
nearly
two
hundred
years
since
women
have
enjoyed
the
same
freedom
and
rights
as
men
it
is
interesting
and
curious
to
note
the
changes
both
upon
the
character
and
nature
of
the
two
sexes
which
has
been
the
result
of
this
development
one
s
first
impression
in
coming
here
is
that
women
are
the
sole
inhabitants
of
the
country
one
sees
them
everywhere
in
all
the
public
offices
as
heads
of
departments
as
government
clerks
as
officials
as
engineers
machinists
aeronauts
tax
collectors
firemen
filling
in
fact
every
office
and
vocation
in
civil
political
and
social
life
the
few
men
by
comparison
whom
i
saw
seemed
to
me
to
be
allowed
to
exist
as
specimen
examples
of
a
fallen
race
of
course
this
view
is
more
or
less
exaggeration
but
the
women
here
do
appear
to
possess
by
far
the
most
energy
vigor
vitality
and
ambition
their
predominance
in
office
just
now
is
owing
to
their
number
the
women
s
vote
polled
being
ten
to
one
over
that
of
the
men
this
strong
sex
influence
has
been
fruitful
in
greatly
changing
and
modifying
the
domestic
social
and
political
laws
of
the
community
women
for
instance
having
satisfactorily
emancipated
themselves
from
the
bondage
of
domestic
drudgery
and
the
dominion
of
servants
by
means
of
the
improvement
in
machinery
and
the
invention
of
the
famous
culinary
conduits
found
one
obstacle
still
in
their
path
to
complete
and
there
still
remained
the
children
to
be
taken
care
of
and
brought
up
as
motherhood
came
in
course
of
time
to
be
considered
in
its
true
light
as
perhaps
the
chief
cause
of
the
degradation
of
women
it
was
finally
abolished
by
act
of
legislature
women
were
still
to
continue
to
bear
children
or
else
the
socialistic
society
itself
would
cease
to
be
a
law
was
passed
providing
that
children
almost
immediately
after
birth
should
be
brought
up
educated
and
trained
under
state
direction
to
be
returned
to
their
parents
when
fully
grown
and
ready
for
their
duties
as
men
and
women
citizens
in
this
way
women
stand
at
last
on
as
absolutely
equal
a
physical
plane
with
men
as
it
is
possible
to
make
them
it
has
followed
of
course
that
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
over
the
children
of
the
community
all
family
life
has
died
out
men
and
women
live
together
as
man
and
wife
but
the
relation
between
them
has
become
more
nominal
than
real
it
is
significant
of
the
changes
that
have
been
brought
about
between
the
sexes
that
the
word
home
has
entirely
dropped
out
of
the
language
a
man
s
house
has
in
truth
ceased
to
be
his
home
there
are
no
children
there
to
greet
him
his
wife
who
is
his
comrade
a
man
a
citizen
like
himself
is
as
rarely
at
home
as
he
their
food
can
be
eaten
anywhere
there
is
no
common
board
there
is
not
even
a
servant
to
welcome
the
master
with
a
smile
the
word
has
also
lost
all
its
original
significance
it
stands
for
nothing
husband
and
wife
are
in
reality
two
men
having
equal
rights
with
the
same
range
of
occupation
the
same
duties
as
citizens
to
perform
the
same
haunts
and
the
same
dreary
leisure
is
it
therefore
my
dear
hannevig
to
be
wondered
at
that
all
ideas
of
love
and
that
all
strong
mutual
attraction
and
affections
should
have
died
out
between
the
sexes
man
loves
longs
for
passionately
and
protects
with
tender
solicitude
only
that
which
is
difficult
to
conquer
the
imagination
must
at
least
be
inflamed
but
where
there
is
no
struggle
no
opposition
no
conditions
which
breed
longing
desire
or
the
poetry
of
a
little
healthy
despair
how
is
love
or
any
sentiment
at
all
to
be
awakened
or
kindled
here
there
is
no
parental
authority
to
make
a
wall
between
lovers
nor
is
there
inequality
of
fortunes
nor
any
marked
difference
between
the
two
sexes
even
in
their
daily
duties
or
in
their
lives
i
am
more
and
more
impressed
with
the
conviction
as
i
look
into
this
question
this
question
of
what
we
should
consider
the
growth
of
an
abnormal
indifference
between
the
sexes
that
the
latter
cause
is
perhaps
the
one
which
has
been
chiefly
instrumental
in
the
bringing
about
so
complete
a
change
over
the
face
of
the
passions
woman
has
placed
herself
by
the
side
of
man
as
his
in
labor
and
vocation
only
to
make
the
real
distance
between
them
the
greater
she
has
gained
her
independence
at
the
expense
of
her
strongest
appeal
to
man
her
power
as
mistress
wife
and
mother
how
can
a
man
get
up
any
very
vivid
or
profound
sentiment
or
affection
for
these
who
are
neither
mothers
nor
housekeepers
who
differ
in
no
smallest
degree
from
themselves
in
their
pursuits
and
occupation
constant
and
perpetual
companionship
from
earliest
infancy
to
manhood
and
old
age
has
resulted
in
blunting
all
sense
of
any
real
difference
between
the
sexes
whatever
slight
inequalities
may
still
exist
between
men
and
women
in
the
matter
of
muscular
energy
or
physical
strength
is
more
than
counterbalanced
by
the
enormous
disproportion
between
them
numerically
as
voters
some
very
curious
and
important
political
changes
have
been
effected
by
the
preponderance
of
the
women
s
vote
wars
for
instance
have
been
within
the
last
fifty
years
declared
illegal
woman
found
that
whereas
she
was
eminently
fitted
for
all
men
s
avocations
in
time
of
peace
when
it
came
to
war
she
made
a
very
poor
figure
of
a
soldier
wars
therefore
were
soon
voted
down
foreign
difficulties
were
adjusted
by
arbitration
as
women
as
a
rule
were
sent
on
these
foreign
diplomatic
missions
i
have
heard
it
wickedly
whispered
that
the
chief
cause
of
the
usually
speedy
conclusion
of
any
trouble
with
a
foreign
court
was
because
of
the
babel
of
tongues
which
ensued
a
foreign
court
being
willing
to
concede
any
thing
rather
than
to
continue
negotiations
with
but
this
of
course
is
to
be
put
down
to
pure
maliciousness
women
since
time
immemorial
have
had
the
best
of
man
whenever
it
came
to
contests
of
the
tongue
and
this
appears
to
be
the
one
insignia
of
their
former
prestige
which
the
sex
insists
on
claiming
in
my
next
i
shall
try
to
give
you
some
conception
of
the
position
which
man
occupies
as
a
citizen
and
as
worker
in
this
community
i
shall
i
think
also
be
able
to
give
you
some
most
interesting
results
of
the
effects
produced
by
the
communistic
socialistic
principles
which
have
been
incorporated
into
the
constitution
of
this
people
it
is
late
and
i
am
weary
so
farewell
for
a
few
days
ever
and
ever
more
and
more
as
i
study
these
institutions
am
i
reminded
of
the
resemblance
between
these
american
socialists
and
the
ancient
spartans
the
spartan
was
also
a
part
of
the
state
had
all
things
on
a
grand
communal
scale
had
public
games
public
theaters
baths
museums
and
festivals
was
brought
up
by
the
state
his
womenkind
being
considered
as
a
part
of
it
in
this
modern
community
however
there
are
two
important
features
which
the
simpler
spartans
did
not
have
to
cope
with
the
greeks
stood
at
the
dawn
of
civilization
the
american
finds
himself
at
what
he
considers
is
the
completion
of
it
break
away
from
his
past
as
hard
as
ever
he
may
try
he
has
still
found
himself
heir
to
this
past
and
his
heredity
dominates
him
in
spite
of
all
his
attempts
to
throw
it
off
the
greeks
also
were
a
warlike
people
and
the
american
is
a
peace
lover
preferring
the
pipe
to
the
sword
perhaps
above
all
else
in
the
sum
of
these
differences
ought
we
to
remember
the
great
factor
of
machinery
as
a
substitute
for
manual
labor
the
sword
raised
man
out
of
the
dust
the
piston
has
levelled
him
with
it
i
believe
my
dear
hannevig
that
if
machinery
had
never
been
invented
socialism
would
never
have
been
dreamed
of
machinery
was
the
true
cause
of
the
conflict
between
capital
and
labor
and
not
the
unequal
distribution
of
land
as
the
great
founder
of
this
communal
society
henry
george
asserted
in
this
book
the
bible
of
this
people
machinery
needed
capital
to
run
it
and
was
more
or
less
indifferent
to
labor
the
laborer
with
machinery
as
his
rival
stood
a
far
less
possible
chance
of
becoming
a
capitalist
himself
than
he
did
when
battling
against
men
his
duties
more
and
more
closely
resembling
in
their
monotony
and
routine
the
very
machine
that
he
was
called
on
to
feed
in
turn
on
his
natural
aptitude
however
to
go
into
the
depths
of
this
knotty
question
involves
too
much
space
for
a
letter
let
me
instead
recall
to
your
mind
as
i
have
recently
done
to
my
own
the
chief
features
of
importance
in
the
history
of
this
people
which
have
placed
them
where
they
now
are
you
recollect
of
course
the
terrible
reign
of
blood
that
took
place
during
the
awful
conflict
between
the
republican
americans
and
the
socialists
and
anarchists
in
the
war
began
nominally
as
an
act
of
resistance
on
the
part
of
the
americans
against
the
encroaching
and
insistent
demands
of
the
socialists
demands
covering
the
abolishment
of
private
ownership
in
land
of
the
division
of
property
both
real
and
personal
and
the
overthrow
generally
of
all
the
then
existing
economic
and
social
institutions
these
socialists
and
anarchists
represented
the
foreign
element
in
the
country
those
who
had
imported
their
revolutionary
doctrines
with
them
if
i
remember
rightly
the
early
americans
had
given
all
rights
of
citizenship
to
this
foreign
contingency
in
a
moment
of
mistaken
republican
zeal
a
political
mistake
they
lived
to
rue
bitterly
later
well
at
first
in
this
anarchist
war
the
americans
won
did
they
not
i
find
my
memory
tripping
me
at
times
possibly
would
have
continued
to
win
had
the
war
been
conducted
on
strict
military
tactics
but
the
anarchists
finding
themselves
unsuccessful
as
soldiers
and
warriors
resorted
to
the
ingenious
means
of
destroying
their
enemies
by
the
use
of
explosives
dynamite
accomplished
what
the
cannon
and
the
bayonet
were
powerless
to
effect
towns
cities
and
even
the
villages
and
hamlets
were
lighted
by
the
torch
of
electricity
and
seared
level
with
the
ground
dynamite
was
reserved
for
the
armies
and
for
individual
offenders
during
that
reign
of
destruction
it
seemed
as
if
not
a
man
woman
or
child
would
survive
to
carry
even
the
memory
of
the
great
tragedy
to
their
graves
with
them
however
since
the
anarchist
s
plan
was
to
reconstruct
the
whole
face
of
society
on
a
new
basis
it
was
to
be
expected
of
course
that
the
revolution
they
undertook
as
the
means
of
effecting
this
would
be
carried
through
at
whatever
cost
there
is
one
feature
of
this
war
which
has
always
struck
me
as
possessing
a
very
humorous
side
the
anarchists
you
remember
were
foreigners
chiefly
germans
irishmen
and
a
few
russians
when
the
war
was
ended
by
the
destruction
of
very
nearly
all
the
republican
contingency
the
anarchists
broke
out
into
dissension
among
themselves
the
german
element
would
not
submit
to
irish
dictation
the
latter
leaders
having
apparently
a
great
opinion
of
their
own
talent
for
political
leadership
and
the
irish
in
turn
violently
resisted
the
german
dicta
a
veritable
anarchy
ensued
a
war
so
fierce
that
it
looked
at
one
time
as
if
the
whole
continent
might
be
left
a
howling
wilderness
with
neither
conqueror
nor
conquered
to
enter
and
take
possession
of
what
was
now
in
truth
but
a
desert
fortunately
however
a
few
of
the
americans
had
survived
among
them
were
some
of
the
descendants
of
the
ancient
new
england
statesmen
these
men
although
under
sentence
of
death
were
liberated
that
they
might
act
as
peacemakers
between
the
two
factions
americans
you
see
had
had
so
much
experience
in
reconciling
conciliating
and
pacifying
the
difficulties
between
the
irish
and
german
parties
during
the
american
republican
era
that
these
survivors
were
eminently
fitted
to
adjust
affairs
at
issue
between
them
now
the
american
council
decided
that
the
irishmen
should
draw
up
the
laws
and
regulations
for
the
new
communal
and
socialistic
constitution
while
the
germans
should
see
that
the
new
society
was
properly
organized
a
decision
which
proves
the
real
genius
for
statescraft
which
these
ingenious
americans
possessed
for
irishmen
are
proverbially
affluent
of
ideas
and
incapable
of
putting
them
into
action
unless
it
be
violent
action
while
the
germans
have
proved
themselves
practical
organizers
and
ideal
political
policemen
the
sagacity
of
the
old
american
republicans
was
shown
in
the
manner
in
which
they
themselves
in
their
era
of
power
had
made
use
of
the
distinguishing
qualities
of
the
two
races
when
such
hordes
overflowed
the
land
during
the
great
emigration
period
the
irishmen
were
kept
in
the
large
cities
where
they
were
allowed
to
misgovern
the
towns
to
their
hearts
desire
being
thus
given
a
vent
for
their
turbulent
political
spirit
while
the
germans
on
the
contrary
were
sent
into
the
still
unconquered
wilderness
to
turn
it
into
a
garden
by
their
industry
and
thrift
the
american
having
thus
made
use
of
the
irishmen
to
run
his
political
machinery
for
him
and
of
the
germans
to
extend
the
territorial
lines
of
order
and
civilization
secured
unto
himself
all
his
own
time
for
money
making
hence
the
colossal
american
fortunes
which
as
we
read
of
them
now
seem
to
us
like
a
tale
of
magicians
such
a
policy
must
have
seemed
to
a
american
as
a
very
shrewd
and
ingenious
way
of
utilizing
elements
which
otherwise
might
prove
dangerous
the
policy
was
in
truth
a
fatally
one
as
was
proved
later
since
it
was
the
enormous
accumulation
of
fortunes
in
a
few
hands
and
the
supposed
tyranny
of
capital
which
wrought
to
a
frenzy
the
envy
and
anger
of
the
foreign
poorer
classes
then
under
the
sway
of
the
anarchist
revolutionists
after
the
american
statesmen
had
made
peace
between
the
conquering
but
quarrelsome
anarchists
these
latter
set
about
organizing
the
new
society
anarchy
itself
although
the
principles
for
which
it
had
fought
and
conquered
now
prevailed
it
was
found
must
subordinate
itself
to
some
form
or
order
before
it
could
hope
to
enforce
order
upon
others
the
anarchist
s
had
been
as
you
remember
away
with
private
property
away
with
all
authority
away
with
the
state
away
with
all
political
machinery
but
now
the
leaders
discovered
that
a
belief
in
the
reign
of
anarchy
was
one
thing
and
its
practice
was
quite
another
for
a
time
as
you
know
there
was
a
terrible
period
of
disorder
during
which
the
grossest
excesses
were
practiced
under
the
name
of
perfect
individualism
a
common
property
common
freedom
common
distribution
for
after
a
few
years
of
the
wildest
indulgence
rapacity
crime
and
cruelty
for
of
course
there
being
no
government
there
could
be
neither
restraints
imposed
nor
crimes
punished
the
people
themselves
at
last
began
to
cry
aloud
for
some
form
of
government
which
should
include
at
least
order
and
decency
the
socialists
doctrines
were
then
decided
upon
as
being
more
in
conformity
with
the
demands
of
the
people
and
with
the
necessities
of
organizing
a
state
than
were
the
formless
theories
of
the
anarchists
the
leaders
among
the
people
as
has
been
done
so
many
times
before
in
the
history
of
the
world
began
again
the
making
of
new
laws
for
the
establishment
of
an
ideal
government
and
the
forming
of
a
new
constitution
which
was
to
insure
perfect
and
complete
happiness
to
the
individual
and
the
race
for
over
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
now
this
ideal
socialistic
society
had
existed
and
what
are
the
results
no
people
ever
assuredly
had
a
more
wonderful
chance
at
constructing
a
society
on
an
ideal
basis
than
had
these
socialists
think
of
it
an
entire
continent
at
their
disposal
their
enemies
or
opponents
all
killed
or
in
exile
and
they
themselves
united
in
desire
and
in
political
interest
well
if
some
of
the
ineradicable
indestructible
principles
in
human
nature
could
be
changed
as
easily
as
laws
are
made
and
unmade
the
chances
for
an
ideal
realization
of
the
happiness
of
mankind
would
be
the
more
easily
attained
but
the
socialists
committed
the
grave
error
of
omitting
to
count
some
of
these
determining
human
laws
into
the
sum
of
their
calculations
time
and
paper
are
however
finite
and
also
presumably
your
patience
i
will
postpone
until
my
next
the
few
remaining
conclusions
to
which
a
brief
study
of
this
people
and
their
government
have
led
your
faithful
wolfgang
vi
dear
friend
the
longer
i
stay
here
the
more
i
am
impressed
with
the
profound
melancholy
which
appears
to
have
taken
possession
of
this
people
the
men
particularly
seem
sunk
in
a
torpor
of
dejection
and
settled
apathy
the
women
although
by
no
means
so
vivacious
and
vigorous
as
our
women
are
however
far
more
animated
and
seem
to
have
a
keener
relish
for
life
than
the
men
probably
the
comparatively
recent
emancipation
of
the
women
their
new
political
and
social
freedom
adds
a
zest
to
the
routine
of
life
here
which
men
do
not
feel
so
universal
is
the
dreary
aspect
of
the
people
whether
at
work
or
play
and
they
play
i
observe
far
more
languidly
than
they
work
that
the
type
of
face
among
them
has
undergone
a
strange
and
interesting
transformation
you
remember
in
the
old
prints
the
typical
yankee
face
with
its
keen
penetrating
eye
its
courageous
determined
chin
its
intelligent
brow
and
its
extraordinarily
shrewd
and
intently
alert
expression
this
vivacity
and
energy
once
the
chief
charm
of
the
american
face
has
entirely
disappeared
in
its
stead
imagine
wooden
almost
sodden
features
heavy
dull
eyes
receding
chins
and
a
brow
on
which
dulness
that
very
nearly
approaches
stupidity
is
writ
in
large
letters
on
all
the
faces
is
a
stereotyped
expression
a
mingling
of
discontent
and
dejection
there
is
the
same
lack
of
variety
of
types
among
the
faces
i
have
noticed
as
there
is
a
want
of
contrast
in
the
houses
and
streets
the
entire
population
appears
to
have
one
face
wherever
one
turns
one
sees
it
repeated
whether
it
be
that
of
man
or
woman
youth
or
old
age
i
have
accounted
to
myself
for
this
curious
physiological
uniformity
by
finding
in
it
simply
a
reflection
of
the
uniformity
seen
in
the
life
and
occupations
of
this
people
the
race
having
been
leveled
to
a
common
plane
there
has
been
a
gradual
dying
out
of
individuality
the
inevitable
curtailment
of
individual
aims
individual
struggle
individual
ambitions
has
naturally
resulted
in
producing
a
featureless
type
of
character
common
to
all
since
of
course
it
is
character
alone
which
moulds
feature
this
people
being
all
more
or
less
alike
have
come
in
process
of
time
to
look
alike
nature
after
all
is
only
clay
in
the
potter
s
hand
man
with
his
laws
and
creeds
fashions
in
the
end
his
own
face
i
found
it
however
far
more
difficult
to
account
for
the
cloud
of
melancholy
and
dejection
which
appears
to
have
settled
upon
this
people
than
to
seek
the
causes
of
the
above
physiological
aspect
i
asked
myself
again
and
again
why
should
this
people
of
all
people
be
full
of
this
discontent
and
unhappiness
haven
t
they
come
to
the
realization
of
all
their
dreams
have
they
not
attained
to
the
very
summit
and
to
the
full
glory
of
the
possession
of
their
social
civic
and
political
desires
and
aspirations
is
there
not
equality
of
sex
has
not
leisure
instead
of
labor
become
a
law
is
not
private
property
abolished
is
not
the
land
the
property
of
the
state
the
wage
system
become
a
thing
of
the
past
and
the
possession
of
capital
made
a
crime
punishable
by
law
does
not
the
state
also
exist
for
the
people
educating
them
training
them
for
their
work
in
life
distributing
among
them
any
surplus
funds
that
the
public
treasury
may
accumulate
and
furnishing
for
their
amusement
and
leisure
a
vast
system
of
educational
clubs
educational
theaters
public
games
museums
and
shows
if
a
people
are
not
happy
under
such
conditions
what
will
insure
content
yet
come
with
me
let
us
walk
through
the
principal
thoroughfares
and
watch
the
multitudes
of
people
wandering
listlessly
up
and
down
the
streets
let
us
see
them
as
they
drift
aimlessly
into
the
theaters
museums
clubs
let
us
look
in
on
them
as
they
idly
finger
the
new
books
and
newspapers
yawning
over
them
as
they
read
and
you
will
agree
with
me
that
the
entire
population
seems
to
have
but
one
really
serious
purpose
in
life
to
murder
time
which
appears
to
be
slowly
killing
them
after
much
thought
on
the
reasons
of
this
strange
apathy
this
inertia
and
sloth
of
energy
i
have
come
to
two
conclusions
which
have
helped
me
to
solve
the
problem
of
this
people
s
unhappiness
my
first
conclusion
is
that
the
people
are
dying
for
want
of
work
of
downright
hard
work
my
second
conclusion
is
that
in
trying
to
establish
the
law
of
equality
the
founders
of
this
ideal
community
committed
the
fatal
mistake
of
counting
out
those
indestructible
ineradicable
human
tendencies
and
aspirations
which
have
hitherto
been
the
source
of
all
human
progress
to
which
i
alluded
in
my
last
letter
first
let
us
take
the
subject
of
work
as
all
work
men
and
women
alike
and
as
machinery
has
been
brought
here
to
a
wonderful
degree
of
perfection
the
actual
labor
necessary
to
maintain
the
people
is
of
necessity
very
light
at
first
a
hundred
or
so
years
ago
in
the
early
days
of
the
community
the
time
of
labor
was
fixed
at
five
hours
per
day
but
every
decade
with
the
growth
of
the
population
the
labor
hours
have
been
diminishing
recently
a
law
has
been
put
into
effect
forbidding
any
one
s
working
more
than
two
hours
a
day
this
latter
law
has
been
found
to
be
an
actual
necessity
from
an
economic
point
of
view
as
a
provision
against
surplus
production
a
man
therefore
has
the
whole
of
the
rest
of
his
day
on
his
hands
to
spend
as
best
he
may
the
original
hope
and
belief
of
the
founders
of
socialism
was
that
if
the
people
could
only
be
given
sufficient
leisure
the
whole
race
would
be
lifted
to
an
extraordinary
plane
of
perfection
that
were
men
given
time
enough
each
man
and
woman
would
devote
himself
and
herself
to
the
development
and
improvement
of
his
or
her
mental
tastes
and
capacities
at
first
i
believe
such
was
the
case
for
at
least
thirty
years
there
was
an
extraordinary
zeal
for
learning
and
but
in
time
a
reaction
came
the
founders
had
forgotten
to
make
allowances
for
the
mass
of
sluggards
idlers
and
ne
who
are
always
the
immovable
block
in
the
reformer
s
path
of
progress
two
parties
were
soon
developed
the
party
of
enlightenment
and
the
conservative
party
learning
being
the
sole
channel
for
the
exercise
of
individual
capacity
or
individual
ambition
the
old
baneful
system
of
competition
soon
developed
itself
a
superior
class
a
class
composed
of
scholars
students
artists
and
authors
arose
whose
views
and
whose
political
ideas
threatened
the
very
life
and
liberties
of
the
community
the
aristocracy
of
intellect
it
was
found
was
as
dangerous
to
the
state
as
an
aristocracy
founded
on
pride
of
descent
or
on
the
possession
of
ancestral
acres
it
became
necessary
therefore
to
make
a
law
against
learning
and
the
sciences
all
scholars
authors
artists
and
scientists
who
were
found
on
examination
to
be
more
gifted
than
the
average
were
exiled
a
strict
law
was
passed
and
has
since
been
rigidly
enforced
forbidding
mental
or
artistic
development
being
carried
beyond
a
certain
fixed
standard
a
standard
attainable
by
all
quite
naturally
learning
and
the
arts
have
gradually
died
out
among
this
people
where
there
are
no
rewards
either
of
fame
or
personal
advancement
the
spur
to
mental
or
artistic
achievement
is
found
wanting
the
arts
particularly
have
languished
art
as
is
well
known
can
only
live
by
the
strength
of
the
imagination
and
the
imagination
is
fed
by
contrasts
of
life
and
degrees
of
picturesqueness
one
of
the
old
american
sages
emerson
i
think
it
was
well
said
of
the
artist
if
the
rich
were
not
rich
how
poor
would
the
poet
be
quite
naturally
in
such
a
civilization
as
this
no
conditions
exist
for
either
creating
or
maintaining
artistic
ability
can
you
not
imagine
my
dear
hannevig
that
under
such
a
system
and
order
of
life
time
might
be
found
to
be
a
weighty
burden
after
the
two
hours
devoted
to
labor
there
are
still
fourteen
waking
hours
to
be
disposed
of
the
people
have
it
is
true
their
clubs
and
their
theaters
the
national
games
their
libraries
and
gardens
but
just
because
all
these
are
free
and
at
their
command
is
i
presume
reason
enough
for
their
finding
the
amusements
thus
provided
tame
and
uninteresting
most
of
the
inhabitants
of
this
city
spend
their
days
at
the
gymnasium
in
the
exercises
and
games
there
practiced
one
sees
the
only
evidence
or
show
of
excitement
and
interest
indulged
in
both
men
and
women
are
muscled
like
athletes
from
their
continual
exercises
and
perpetual
bathing
the
athletic
party
is
now
trying
to
pass
a
law
to
permit
races
and
contests
on
the
old
greek
plan
but
the
conservatives
will
scarcely
pass
it
as
they
urge
that
the
olympian
games
by
developing
the
physical
powers
were
in
reality
only
a
for
the
greek
army
and
internecine
trouble
and
dissension
would
surely
follow
any
such
public
games
as
they
did
in
the
greek
states
you
have
i
believe
asked
me
if
the
people
here
are
not
allowed
to
find
a
scope
for
their
superfluous
energies
in
politics
but
politics
as
a
profession
as
a
separate
and
independent
function
of
activity
has
ceased
to
exist
the
state
or
government
is
run
on
the
great
universal
principle
of
reciprocity
which
governs
the
entire
community
it
exists
for
the
people
is
administered
by
the
people
and
acts
for
the
people
all
surplus
revenues
derived
from
a
minimum
of
equalized
taxation
are
turned
over
to
the
public
fund
being
applied
to
public
use
the
machinery
of
the
government
is
run
on
the
same
principle
of
light
labor
which
governs
individual
exertions
each
citizen
men
and
women
alike
of
course
serves
his
or
her
term
as
a
government
official
as
in
old
prussia
men
served
in
the
army
as
no
one
is
ever
no
matter
what
his
capacity
or
ability
and
as
each
citizen
only
serves
once
during
his
there
is
no
such
thing
known
as
political
strife
or
bribery
or
corruption
neither
is
there
any
political
life
the
government
is
as
automatic
a
performance
as
one
of
the
of
a
factory
there
are
certain
changes
which
have
lately
taken
place
in
the
political
and
international
affairs
of
the
people
which
lead
one
into
a
labyrinth
of
speculation
there
has
for
instance
been
a
noticeable
and
lamentable
dying
out
of
international
commerce
and
a
general
sluggishness
of
trade
which
greatly
alarms
the
community
at
large
all
trade
and
commerce
are
conducted
on
the
socialistic
principle
which
forbids
the
venture
of
private
capital
did
such
here
exist
or
of
private
enterprise
it
is
the
state
which
directs
all
such
ventures
but
the
state
for
some
reason
or
other
does
not
appear
to
be
a
success
as
a
merchant
or
as
commercial
financier
for
one
thing
the
state
is
tremendously
absorbed
in
its
own
affairs
as
it
takes
care
of
its
people
educating
training
and
developing
them
as
it
looks
after
the
material
comforts
and
necessities
of
its
vast
population
its
own
internal
duties
really
absorb
all
its
energies
then
in
a
government
founded
as
this
one
is
on
a
principle
of
equality
which
principle
is
the
sworn
enemy
of
ambition
there
must
of
necessity
be
a
lack
of
initiative
a
feebleness
in
aggressive
attack
and
a
want
of
determination
in
the
pursuance
of
any
given
policy
it
is
only
ambitious
stable
governments
which
can
command
and
maintain
a
definite
policy
of
national
action
even
the
american
republic
found
it
difficult
with
its
recurrent
changes
in
official
departments
to
carry
into
effect
great
international
projects
the
people
here
have
ended
by
contenting
themselves
with
the
exercise
of
only
so
much
executive
political
or
commercial
activity
as
is
found
actually
necessary
to
maintain
their
own
existence
men
whether
as
individuals
or
as
a
collective
body
are
indeed
only
actively
aggressive
ambitious
or
audacious
in
proportion
as
they
meet
with
opposition
it
is
struggle
and
not
the
absence
of
it
which
makes
both
men
and
a
nation
great
i
have
therefore
ceased
to
ask
myself
where
are
the
old
magnificent
energies
which
once
characterized
this
people
one
looks
in
vain
for
the
former
warfare
of
intelligence
for
the
old
time
audacity
of
invention
for
the
fray
of
commercial
contest
for
the
powerful
massing
of
capital
we
read
of
as
characteristic
of
americans
two
hundred
years
ago
all
this
has
gone
with
the
old
competitive
system
with
the
abolishment
of
competition
have
died
out
naturally
all
the
prizes
and
rewards
in
life
which
came
from
individual
struggle
as
accumulation
of
personal
property
in
lands
or
in
moneys
and
the
possibility
of
personal
advancement
are
forbidden
by
law
under
this
form
of
government
all
incentives
to
personal
activity
have
disappeared
the
law
of
equality
with
its
logical
decrees
for
the
suppression
of
superiority
has
brought
about
the
other
extreme
sterility
the
crippling
of
individual
activity
has
finally
produced
its
legitimate
result
it
has
fatally
sapped
the
energies
of
the
people
it
is
a
curious
and
interesting
feature
in
one
s
study
of
this
people
to
find
that
it
is
not
the
establishment
of
the
law
of
equality
which
has
been
the
cause
of
decay
in
this
people
but
the
enforcement
of
the
opposite
law
the
law
it
was
soon
found
necessary
to
establish
against
inequality
it
naturally
and
logically
followed
that
if
men
are
to
be
made
equal
such
equality
can
only
be
maintained
by
the
suppression
of
degrees
of
inequality
mentally
for
instance
the
standard
must
be
made
low
enough
for
all
to
attain
it
each
man
therefore
in
time
no
matter
what
his
fitness
capacity
or
gift
was
forced
to
subordinate
his
particular
qualities
to
the
general
possibility
of
attainment
this
level
of
a
common
mediocrity
was
more
or
less
difficult
to
inforce
and
develop
their
own
historians
record
many
interesting
accounts
of
the
slow
death
of
inequality
in
one
i
read
only
yesterday
so
instinctive
through
long
centuries
of
oppression
and
misuse
of
power
was
the
impulse
among
men
to
aspire
to
superiority
of
attainment
to
excel
in
mental
development
or
to
exhibit
richer
creative
power
that
for
years
the
state
penitentiaries
were
filled
with
men
whose
crime
was
their
unconquerable
desire
selfishly
to
surpass
their
less
fortunate
brothers
it
is
only
within
our
own
enlightened
century
that
this
grave
fault
has
been
remedied
now
happily
no
one
dreams
of
insuring
his
own
personal
happiness
at
the
expense
of
and
so
my
dear
hannevig
the
old
drama
of
history
is
enacted
anew
years
ago
men
were
unhappy
because
the
many
had
to
struggle
against
the
favored
few
here
where
all
are
equal
men
are
miserable
because
they
are
so
because
all
having
equal
claims
to
happiness
find
life
equally
dull
and
aimless
the
perpetual
moan
here
is
o
for
a
chance
to
something
to
do
something
to
achieve
something
i
shall
be
able
to
send
you
only
one
more
letter
as
i
return
in
a
few
days
by
balloon
this
time
i
think
instead
of
by
tunnel
vii
christmas
day
my
good
hannevig
i
have
only
just
time
to
send
you
one
more
incident
and
scene
it
being
as
you
may
have
observed
at
the
top
of
my
letter
christmas
day
i
was
curious
to
see
how
this
festival
would
be
observed
here
somewhat
to
my
surprise
i
observed
that
the
population
went
about
their
avocations
just
as
usual
then
i
reflected
in
a
country
where
every
day
after
eleven
in
the
morning
a
true
holiday
sets
in
there
being
nothing
for
any
one
to
do
except
to
enjoy
himself
it
would
be
difficult
fitly
to
celebrate
any
special
fete
day
in
point
of
fact
there
are
none
such
the
people
voted
them
out
of
the
calendar
saying
they
had
all
they
could
do
to
kill
the
ordinary
enjoyment
hours
of
each
week
without
having
to
invent
new
games
or
occupations
for
a
dozen
different
feast
days
so
all
holidays
are
prescribed
by
law
except
christmas
this
day
is
kept
up
for
two
reasons
because
it
is
thought
to
be
an
excellent
time
to
show
off
the
children
brought
up
by
the
state
to
the
people
and
also
because
on
christmas
day
each
child
is
allowed
to
spend
the
day
at
home
the
exercises
of
the
day
began
at
the
great
ethical
temple
here
ten
thousand
children
were
gathered
to
listen
first
to
a
lecture
on
the
history
of
christmas
there
was
a
play
in
which
santa
claus
appeared
and
a
number
of
other
legendary
characters
to
show
the
children
in
what
mythological
absurd
beings
the
children
of
the
unenlightened
nineteenth
century
believed
in
then
ten
thousand
toys
were
distributed
dolls
and
whips
and
tops
and
sleighs
and
skates
but
as
all
were
distributed
indiscriminately
by
state
officers
to
the
children
as
they
passed
out
on
review
of
course
all
the
boys
got
the
dolls
and
the
girls
the
whips
and
tops
an
hour
afterward
outside
the
great
building
i
saw
groups
of
the
children
doing
a
tremendous
exchange
far
more
interested
in
bartering
damaged
dolls
for
shining
skates
than
in
endeavoring
to
establish
the
identity
of
their
own
parents
whom
indeed
having
only
seen
a
few
times
in
the
course
of
their
lives
they
barely
know
by
sight
i
was
slowly
walking
homeward
speculating
on
these
and
other
revelations
made
by
a
more
intimate
knowledge
of
the
workings
of
this
great
community
when
i
encountered
a
familiar
face
it
was
that
of
my
young
whose
conversation
i
reported
to
you
above
she
joined
me
and
we
walked
on
together
i
hear
you
are
going
back
to
sweden
is
it
true
she
asked
yes
i
return
in
a
few
but
you
have
enjoyed
your
trip
and
us
immensely
you
are
a
wonderful
that
if
i
remember
is
just
what
foreigners
said
to
americans
two
hundred
years
i
like
this
young
girl
particularly
she
is
more
intelligent
than
most
of
the
women
one
meets
here
she
is
allowed
to
be
she
told
me
because
she
was
so
much
less
than
others
which
is
true
but
in
this
land
of
dead
equality
one
is
grateful
for
a
little
intelligence
even
if
it
be
served
up
with
ugliness
there
is
one
thing
i
can
not
become
accustomed
to
i
said
not
wishing
to
be
called
to
closer
account
for
my
impressions
and
that
is
that
there
are
no
church
steeples
or
spires
the
absence
of
them
gives
such
a
uniform
look
to
all
your
churches
oh
they
went
out
long
ago
you
know
religion
it
was
found
brought
about
discussion
it
was
voted
yes
i
know
only
i
thought
a
few
spires
or
churches
might
possibly
have
been
preserved
in
a
kind
of
sentimental
pickle
as
castles
and
ruins
are
kept
in
england
to
add
what
an
old
writer
calls
the
necessary
element
of
decay
to
the
that
was
ruskin
was
it
not
what
a
quaint
old
writer
his
books
read
as
if
they
were
written
in
a
dead
language
as
for
the
churches
they
were
all
destroyed
you
know
in
the
war
between
the
radicals
and
the
orthodox
and
not
a
stone
was
left
standing
since
then
the
state
has
erected
these
huge
ethical
temples
where
all
the
religions
are
explained
and
where
the
philosophy
of
ethics
is
taught
the
people
the
finest
of
all
these
temples
is
the
temple
of
the
liberators
have
you
seen
it
yet
she
asked
i
have
not
but
i
should
like
to
do
so
will
you
be
my
guide
she
led
me
thither
we
soon
came
to
a
structure
which
being
smaller
and
of
fairly
good
and
symmetrical
proportions
was
a
little
less
hideous
than
the
other
temples
i
had
seen
inside
in
the
center
of
the
building
was
a
colossal
statue
a
portrait
it
is
said
of
the
founder
henry
george
around
the
sides
of
the
wall
were
niches
where
portrait
busts
of
the
martyrs
stand
the
nihilists
early
anarchists
and
socialists
who
endured
persecution
and
often
death
in
the
early
days
of
socialism
a
book
i
noticed
was
placed
near
the
henry
george
statue
it
was
the
socialistic
bible
poverty
and
progress
which
with
a
number
of
other
such
books
forms
the
chief
literature
of
the
people
once
a
year
my
young
friend
told
me
there
is
a
sacred
reading
to
the
people
from
this
book
as
we
turned
to
pursue
our
way
homeward
she
again
began
to
question
me
but
you
haven
t
told
me
yet
what
you
think
of
us
as
a
country
and
a
people
she
persisted
well
since
you
will
have
it
i
will
tell
you
you
are
a
great
and
surprising
people
i
mean
great
in
the
sense
of
numbers
however
for
great
politically
and
morally
you
can
never
be
again
you
appear
to
have
attained
a
certain
order
of
perfection
which
however
is
only
relative
you
think
you
have
solved
all
the
great
problems
but
you
have
only
begun
to
solve
them
in
attempting
to
make
the
people
happy
by
insuring
equality
of
goods
and
equal
division
of
property
you
have
found
it
necessary
to
stultify
ambition
and
to
kill
aspiration
therefore
a
healthy
vigorous
morale
has
ceased
to
exist
in
making
leisure
a
law
you
have
robbed
it
of
its
sweetness
ennui
is
the
curse
of
the
land
the
arts
languish
because
the
arts
depend
on
the
imagination
and
imagination
has
been
declared
illegal
since
all
are
not
born
with
it
your
libraries
and
museums
are
open
but
who
sees
them
filled
with
readers
and
students
in
other
words
man
having
been
born
heir
to
all
things
has
ceased
to
value
them
and
so
i
leave
you
well
content
to
go
back
to
my
barbaric
sweden
where
the
forms
of
political
government
are
so
bad
that
men
wrestle
like
gods
to
remedy
them
and
where
men
themselves
are
still
born
so
unequal
that
they
have
to
fight
like
demons
to
live
at
all
we
are
still
chaotic
and
unformed
and
unredeemed
and
unregenerate
but
we
are
tremendously
alive
and
so
i
return
with
eager
joy
to
take
my
part
in
the
strife
to
be
a
man
in
other
words
and
not
a
part
of
a
colossal
machine
why
not
go
back
with
me
it
will
be
a
great
experience
you
would
go
back
at
least
two
hundred
she
sighed
and
murmured
we
are
not
allowed
to
travel
it
is
forbidden
it
breeds
dissatisfaction
but
i
wish
we
were
it
sounds
so
very
beautiful
and
and
so
i
left
her
as
i
must
you
for
my
letter
is
a
volume
in
a
few
days
i
shall
be
telling
you
all
i
can
not
write
adieu
