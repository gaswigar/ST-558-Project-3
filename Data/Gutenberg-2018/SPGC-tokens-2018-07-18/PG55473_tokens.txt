following

the
legend
of
near
the
village
of
kurosaka
in
the
province
of
hōki
there
is
a
waterfall
called
or
the
cascade
of
ghosts
why
it
is
so
called
i
do
not
know
near
the
foot
of
the
fall
there
is
a
small
shintō
shrine
of
the
god
of
the
locality
whom
the
people
name
and
in
front
of
the
shrine
is
a
little
wooden
to
receive
the
offerings
of
believers
and
there
is
a
story
about
that
one
icy
winter
evening
years
ago
the
women
and
girls
employed
at
a
certain
or
in
kurosaka
gathered
around
the
big
brazier
in
the
after
their
day
work
had
been
done
then
they
amused
themselves
by
telling
by
the
time
that
a
dozen
stories
had
been
told
most
of
the
gathering
felt
uncomfortable
and
a
girl
cried
out
just
to
heighten
the
pleasure
of
fear
only
think
of
going
this
night
all
by
one
self
to
the
the
suggestion
provoked
a
general
scream
followed
by
nervous
bursts
of
laughter
i
give
all
the
hemp
i
spun
mockingly
said
one
of
the
party
to
the
person
who
goes
so
will
i
exclaimed
another
and
i
said
a
third
all
of
us
affirmed
a
fourth
then
from
among
the
spinners
stood
up
one
yasumoto
the
wife
of
a
carpenter
she
had
her
only
son
a
boy
of
two
years
old
snugly
wrapped
up
and
asleep
upon
her
back
listen
said
if
you
will
all
really
agree
to
make
over
to
me
all
the
hemp
spun
i
will
go
to
the
her
proposal
was
received
with
cries
of
astonishment
and
of
defiance
but
after
having
been
several
times
repeated
it
was
seriously
taken
each
of
the
spinners
in
turn
agreed
to
give
up
her
share
of
the
day
work
to
providing
that
should
go
to
the
but
how
are
we
to
know
if
she
really
goes
there
a
sharp
voice
asked
why
let
her
bring
back
the
of
the
god
answered
an
old
woman
whom
the
spinners
called
the
grandmother
that
will
be
proof
enough
i
bring
it
cried
and
out
she
darted
into
the
street
with
her
sleeping
boy
upon
her
back
the
night
was
frosty
but
clear
down
the
empty
street
hurried
and
she
saw
that
all
the
house
fronts
were
tightly
closed
because
of
the
piercing
cold
out
of
the
village
and
along
the
high
road
she
ran
with
the
great
silence
of
frozen
on
either
hand
and
only
the
stars
to
light
her
half
an
hour
she
followed
the
open
road
then
she
turned
down
a
narrower
way
winding
under
cliffs
darker
and
rougher
the
path
became
as
she
proceeded
but
she
knew
it
well
and
she
soon
heard
the
dull
roar
of
the
water
a
few
minutes
more
and
the
way
widened
into
a
glen
and
the
dull
roar
suddenly
became
a
loud
clamor
and
before
her
she
saw
looming
against
a
mass
of
blackness
the
long
glimmering
of
the
fall
dimly
she
perceived
the
shrine
the
she
rushed
forward
put
out
her
hand
suddenly
called
a
warning
voice
above
the
crash
of
the
water
stood
motionless
stupefied
by
terror
again
pealed
the
voice
this
time
with
more
of
menace
in
its
tone
but
was
really
a
bold
woman
at
once
recovering
from
her
stupefaction
she
snatched
up
the
and
ran
she
neither
heard
nor
saw
anything
more
to
alarm
her
until
she
reached
the
highroad
where
she
stopped
a
moment
to
take
breath
then
she
ran
on
steadily
till
she
got
to
kurosaka
and
thumped
at
the
door
of
the
how
the
women
and
the
girls
cried
out
as
she
entered
panting
with
the
of
the
god
in
her
hand
breathlessly
they
heard
her
story
sympathetically
they
screeched
when
she
told
them
of
the
voice
that
had
called
her
name
twice
out
of
the
haunted
water
what
a
woman
brave
well
had
she
earned
the
hemp
but
your
boy
must
be
cold
cried
the
let
us
have
him
here
by
the
fire
he
ought
to
be
hungry
exclaimed
the
mother
i
must
give
him
his
milk
poor
said
the
helping
to
remove
the
wraps
in
which
the
boy
had
been
carried
why
you
are
all
wet
behind
then
with
a
husky
scream
the
helper
vociferated
it
is
blood
and
out
of
the
wrappings
unfastened
there
fell
to
the
floor
a
bundle
of
baby
clothes
that
left
exposed
two
very
small
brown
feet
and
two
very
small
brown
hands
nothing
more
the
head
had
been
torn
off
illustration
footnote
the
exclamation
is
used
to
call
the
attention
of
a
person

equivalent
for

illustration
in
a
cup
of
tea
have
you
ever
attempted
to
mount
some
old
tower
stairway
spiring
up
through
darkness
and
in
the
heart
of
that
darkness
found
yourself
at
the
cobwebbed
edge
of
nothing
or
have
you
followed
some
coast
path
cut
along
the
face
of
a
cliff
only
to
discover
yourself
at
a
turn
on
the
jagged
verge
of
a
break
the
emotional
worth
of
such
experience
from
a
literary
point
of
view
is
proved
by
the
force
of
the
sensations
aroused
and
by
the
vividness
with
which
they
are
remembered
now
there
have
been
curiously
preserved
in
old
japanese
certain
fragments
of
fiction
that
produce
an
almost
similar
emotional
experience
perhaps
the
writer
was
lazy
perhaps
he
had
a
quarrel
with
the
publisher
perhaps
he
was
suddenly
called
away
from
his
little
table
and
never
came
back
perhaps
death
stopped
the
in
the
very
middle
of
a
sentence
but
no
mortal
man
can
ever
tell
us
exactly
why
these
things
were
left
unfinished
i
select
a
typical
example
on
the
fourth
day
of
the
first
month
of
the
third
tenwa
that
is
to
say
about
two
hundred
and
twenty
years
ago
the
lord
nakagawa
sado
while
on
his
way
to
make
a
new
year
visit
halted
with
his
train
at
a
in
hakusan
in
the
hongō
district
of
yedo
while
the
party
were
resting
there
one
of
the
lord
attendants
a
named
sekinai
feeling
very
thirsty
filled
for
himself
a
large
with
tea
he
was
raising
the
cup
to
his
lips
when
he
suddenly
perceived
in
the
transparent
yellow
infusion
the
image
or
reflection
of
a
face
that
was
not
his
own
startled
he
looked
around
but
could
see
no
one
near
him
the
face
in
the
tea
appeared
from
the
coiffure
to
be
the
face
of
a
young
samurai
it
was
strangely
distinct
and
very
handsome
delicate
as
the
face
of
a
girl
and
it
seemed
the
reflection
of
a
living
face
for
the
eyes
and
the
lips
were
moving
bewildered
by
this
mysterious
apparition
sekinai
threw
away
the
tea
and
carefully
examined
the
cup
it
proved
to
be
a
very
cheap
with
no
artistic
devices
of
any
sort
he
found
and
filled
another
cup
and
again
the
face
appeared
in
the
tea
he
then
ordered
fresh
tea
and
refilled
the
cup
and
once
more
the
strange
face
appeared
this
time
with
a
mocking
smile
but
sekinai
did
not
allow
himself
to
be
frightened
whoever
you
are
he
muttered
you
shall
delude
me
no
further
then
he
swallowed
the
tea
face
and
all
and
went
his
way
wondering
whether
he
had
swallowed
a
ghost
late
in
the
evening
of
the
same
day
while
on
watch
in
the
palace
of
the
lord
nakagawa
sekinai
was
surprised
by
the
soundless
coming
of
a
stranger
into
the
apartment
this
stranger
a
richly
dressed
young
samurai
seated
himself
directly
in
front
of
sekinai
and
saluting
the
with
a
slight
bow
observed
i
am
shikibu
heinai
met
you
for
the
first
time
you
do
not
seem
to
recognize
me
he
spoke
in
a
very
low
but
penetrating
voice
and
sekinai
was
astonished
to
find
before
him
the
same
sinister
handsome
face
of
which
he
had
seen
and
swallowed
the
apparition
in
a
cup
of
tea
it
was
smiling
now
as
the
phantom
had
smiled
but
the
steady
gaze
of
the
eyes
above
the
smiling
lips
was
at
once
a
challenge
and
an
insult
no
i
do
not
recognize
you
returned
sekinai
angry
but
cool
and
perhaps
you
will
now
be
good
enough
to
inform
me
how
you
obtained
admission
to
this
house
in
feudal
times
the
residence
of
a
lord
was
strictly
guarded
at
all
hours
and
no
one
could
enter
unannounced
except
through
some
unpardonable
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
armed
watch
ah
you
do
not
recognize
me
exclaimed
the
visitor
in
a
tone
of
irony
drawing
a
little
nearer
as
he
spoke
no
you
do
not
recognize
me
yet
you
took
upon
yourself
this
morning
to
do
me
a
deadly
injury
sekinai
instantly
seized
the
at
his
girdle
and
made
a
fierce
thrust
at
the
throat
of
the
man
but
the
blade
seemed
to
touch
no
substance
simultaneously
and
soundlessly
the
intruder
leaped
sideward
to
the
through
it
the
wall
showed
no
trace
of
his
exit
he
had
traversed
it
only
as
the
light
of
a
candle
passes
through
when
sekinai
made
report
of
the
incident
his
recital
astonished
and
puzzled
the
retainers
no
stranger
had
been
seen
either
to
enter
or
to
leave
the
palace
at
the
hour
of
the
occurrence
and
no
one
in
the
service
of
the
lord
nakagawa
had
ever
heard
of
the
name
shikibu
heinai
on
the
following
night
sekinai
was
off
duty
and
remained
at
home
with
his
parents
at
a
rather
late
hour
he
was
informed
that
some
strangers
had
called
at
the
house
and
desired
to
speak
with
him
for
a
moment
taking
his
sword
he
went
to
the
entrance
and
there
found
three
armed
men
apparently
retainers
waiting
in
front
of
the
doorstep
the
three
bowed
respectfully
to
sekinai
and
one
of
them
said
our
names
are
matsuoka
bungō
tsuchibashi
bungō
and
okamura
heiroku
we
are
retainers
of
the
noble
shikibu
heinai
when
our
master
last
night
deigned
to
pay
you
a
visit
you
struck
him
with
a
sword
he
was
much
will
hurt
and
has
been
obliged
to
go
to
the
hot
springs
where
his
wound
is
now
being
treated
but
on
the
sixteenth
day
of
the
coming
month
he
will
return
and
he
will
then
fitly
repay
you
for
the
injury
done
him
without
waiting
to
hear
more
sekinai
leaped
out
sword
in
hand
and
slashed
right
and
left
at
the
strangers
but
the
three
men
sprang
to
the
wall
of
the
adjoining
building
and
flitted
up
the
wall
like
shadows
and

able
to

several
possible
endings
but
none
of
them
would
satisfy
an
occidental
imagination

prefer

probable
consequence
of
swallowing
a
soul

once
there
lived
upon
the
mountain
called
atagoyama
near
kyoto
a
certain
learned
priest
who
devoted
all
his
time
to
meditation
and
the
study
of
the
sacred
books
the
little
temple
in
which
he
dwelt
was
far
from
any
village
and
he
could
not
in
such
a
solitude
have
obtained
without
help
the
common
necessaries
of
life
but
several
devout
country
people
regularly
contributed
to
his
maintenance
bringing
him
each
month
supplies
of
vegetables
and
of
rice
among
these
good
folk
there
was
a
certain
hunter
who
sometimes
visited
the
mountain
in
search
of
game
one
day
when
this
hunter
had
brought
a
bag
of
rice
to
the
temple
the
priest
said
to
him
friend
i
must
tell
you
that
wonderful
things
have
happened
here
since
the
last
time
i
saw
you
i
do
not
certainly
know
why
such
things
should
have
happened
in
my
unworthy
presence
but
you
are
aware
that
i
have
been
meditating
and
reciting
the
sûtras
daily
for
many
years
and
it
is
possible
that
what
has
been
vouchsafed
me
is
due
to
the
merit
obtained
through
these
religious
exercises
i
am
not
sure
of
this
but
i
am
sure
that
fugen
bosatsu
comes
nightly
to
this
temple
riding
upon
his
elephant
stay
here
with
me
this
night
friend
then
you
will
be
able
to
see
and
to
worship
the
buddha
to
witness
so
holy
a
vision
the
hunter
replied
were
a
privilege
indeed
most
gladly
i
shall
stay
and
worship
with
you
so
the
hunter
remained
at
the
temple
but
while
the
priest
was
engaged
in
his
religious
exercises
the
hunter
began
to
think
about
the
promised
miracle
and
to
doubt
whether
such
a
thing
could
be
and
the
more
he
thought
the
more
he
doubted
there
was
a
little
boy
in
the
temple
an
acolyte
and
the
hunter
found
an
opportunity
to
question
the
boy
the
priest
told
me
said
the
hunter
that
fugen
bosatsu
comes
to
this
temple
every
night
have
you
also
seen
fugen
bosatsu
six
times
already
the
acolyte
replied
i
have
seen
and
reverently
worshipped
fugen
bosatsu
this
declaration
only
served
to
increase
the
hunter
suspicions
though
he
did
not
in
the
least
doubt
the
truthfulness
of
the
boy
he
reflected
however
that
he
would
probably
be
able
to
see
whatever
the
boy
had
seen
and
he
waited
with
eagerness
for
the
hour
of
the
promised
vision
shortly
before
midnight
the
priest
announced
that
it
was
time
to
prepare
for
the
coming
of
fugen
bosatsu
the
doors
of
the
little
temple
were
thrown
open
and
the
priest
knelt
down
at
the
threshold
with
his
face
to
the
east
the
acolyte
knelt
at
his
left
hand
and
the
hunter
respectfully
placed
himself
behind
the
priest
it
was
the
night
of
the
twentieth
of
the
ninth
month
a
dreary
dark
and
very
windy
night
and
the
three
waited
a
long
time
for
the
coming
of
fugen
bosatsu
but
at
last
a
point
of
white
light
appeared
like
a
star
in
the
direction
of
the
east
and
this
light
approached
quickly
growing
larger
and
larger
as
it
came
and
illuminating
all
the
slope
of
the
mountain
presently
the
light
took
shape
the
shape
of
a
being
divine
riding
upon
a
elephant
with
six
tusks
and
in
another
moment
the
elephant
with
its
shining
rider
arrived
before
the
temple
and
there
stood
towering
like
a
mountain
of
moonlight
wonderful
and
weird
then
the
priest
and
the
boy
prostrating
themselves
began
with
exceeding
fervour
to
repeat
the
holy
invocation
to
fugen
bosatsu
but
suddenly
the
hunter
rose
up
behind
them
bow
in
hand
and
bending
his
bow
to
the
full
he
sent
a
long
arrow
whizzing
straight
at
the
luminous
buddha
into
whose
breast
it
sank
up
to
the
very
feathers
immediately
with
a
sound
like
a
the
white
light
vanished
and
the
vision
disappeared
before
the
temple
there
was
nothing
but
windy
darkness
o
miserable
man
cried
out
the
priest
with
tears
of
shame
and
despair
o
most
wretched
and
wicked
man
what
have
you
done
what
have
you
done
but
the
hunter
received
the
reproaches
of
the
priest
without
any
sign
of
compunction
or
of
anger
then
he
said
very
gently
reverend
sir
please
try
to
calm
yourself
and
listen
to
me
you
thought
that
you
were
able
to
see
fugen
bosatsu
because
of
some
merit
obtained
through
your
constant
meditations
and
your
recitation
of
the
sûtras
but
if
that
had
been
the
case
the
buddha
would
have
appeared
to
you
only
not
to
me
nor
even
to
the
boy
i
am
an
ignorant
hunter
and
my
occupation
is
to
kill
and
the
taking
of
life
is
hateful
to
the
buddhas
how
then
should
i
be
able
to
see
fugen
bosatsu
i
have
been
taught
that
the
buddhas
are
everywhere
about
us
and
that
we
remain
unable
to
see
them
because
of
our
ignorance
and
our
imperfections
you
being
a
learned
priest
of
pure
life
might
indeed
acquire
such
enlightenment
as
would
enable
you
to
see
the
buddhas
but
how
should
a
man
who
kills
animals
for
his
livelihood
find
the
power
to
see
the
divine
both
i
and
this
little
boy
could
see
all
that
you
saw
and
let
me
now
assure
you
reverend
sir
that
what
you
saw
was
not
fugen
bosatsu
but
a
goblinry
intended
to
deceive
you
perhaps
even
to
destroy
you
i
beg
that
you
will
try
to
control
your
feelings
until
daybreak
then
i
will
prove
to
you
the
truth
of
what
i
have
said
at
sunrise
the
hunter
and
the
priest
examined
the
spot
where
the
vision
had
been
standing
and
they
discovered
a
thin
trail
of
blood
and
after
having
followed
this
trail
to
a
hollow
some
hundred
paces
away
they
came
upon
the
body
of
a
great
badger
transfixed
by
the
hunter
arrow
the
priest
although
a
learned
and
pious
person
had
easily
been
deceived
by
a
badger
but
the
hunter
an
ignorant
and
irreligious
man
was
gifted
with
strong
common
sense
and
by
alone
he
was
able
at
once
to
detect
and
to
destroy
a
dangerous
illusion

formerly
in
the
quarter
of
reiganjima
in
yedo
there
was
a
great
porcelain
shop
called
the
setomonodana
kept
by
a
rich
man
named
kihei
kihei
had
in
his
employ
for
many
years
a
head
clerk
named
rokubei
under
rokubei
care
the
business
prospered
and
at
last
it
grew
so
large
that
rokubei
found
himself
unable
to
manage
it
without
help
he
therefore
asked
and
obtained
permission
to
hire
an
experienced
assistant
and
he
then
engaged
one
of
his
own
nephews
a
young
man
about
years
old
who
had
learned
the
porcelain
trade
in
osaka
the
nephew
proved
a
very
capable
assistant
shrewder
in
business
than
his
experienced
uncle
his
enterprise
extended
the
trade
of
the
house
and
kihei
was
greatly
pleased
but
about
seven
months
after
his
engagement
the
young
man
became
very
ill
and
seemed
likely
to
die
the
best
physicians
in
yedo
were
summoned
to
attend
him
but
none
of
them
could
understand
the
nature
of
his
sickness
they
prescribed
no
medicine
and
expressed
the
opinion
that
such
a
sickness
could
only
have
been
caused
by
some
secret
grief
rokubei
imagined
that
it
might
be
a
case
of
lovesickness
he
therefore
said
to
his
nephew
i
have
been
thinking
that
as
you
are
still
very
young
you
might
have
formed
some
secret
attachment
which
is
making
you
unhappy
perhaps
even
making
you
ill
if
this
be
the
truth
you
certainly
ought
to
tell
me
all
about
your
troubles
here
i
stand
to
you
in
the
place
of
a
father
as
you
are
far
away
from
your
parents
and
if
you
have
any
anxiety
or
sorrow
i
am
ready
to
do
for
you
whatever
a
father
should
do
if
money
can
help
you
do
not
be
ashamed
to
tell
me
even
though
the
amount
be
large
i
think
that
i
could
assist
you
and
i
am
sure
that
kihei
would
be
glad
to
do
anything
to
make
you
happy
and
well
the
sick
youth
appeared
to
be
embarrassed
by
these
kindly
assurances
and
for
some
little
time
he
remained
silent
at
last
he
answered
never
in
this
world
can
i
forget
those
generous
words
but
i
have
no
secret
attachment
no
longing
for
any
woman
this
sickness
of
mine
is
not
a
sickness
that
doctors
can
cure
and
money
could
not
help
me
in
the
least
the
truth
is
that
i
have
been
so
persecuted
in
this
house
that
i
scarcely
care
to
live
everywhere
by
day
and
by
night
whether
in
the
shop
or
in
my
room
whether
alone
or
in
company
i
have
been
unceasingly
followed
and
tormented
by
the
shadow
of
a
woman
and
it
is
long
long
since
i
have
been
able
to
get
even
one
night
rest
for
so
soon
as
i
close
my
eyes
the
shadow
of
the
woman
takes
me
by
the
throat
and
strives
to
strangle
me
so
i
can
not
sleep
and
why
did
you
not
tell
me
this
before
asked
rokubei
because
i
thought
the
nephew
answered
that
it
would
be
of
no
use
to
tell
you
the
shadow
is
not
the
ghost
of
a
dead
person
it
is
made
by
the
hatred
of
a
living
person
a
person
whom
you
very
well
know
what
person
questioned
rokubei
in
great
astonishment
the
mistress
of
this
house
whispered
the
youth
the
wife
of
kihei
sama
she
wishes
to
kill
me
rokubei
was
bewildered
by
this
confession
he
doubted
nothing
of
what
his
nephew
had
said
but
he
could
not
imagine
a
reason
for
the
haunting
an
might
be
caused
by
disappointed
love
or
by
violent
hate
without
the
knowledge
of
the
person
from
whom
it
had
emanated
to
suppose
any
love
in
this
case
was
impossible
the
wife
of
kihei
was
considerably
more
than
fifty
years
of
age
but
on
the
other
hand
what
could
the
young
clerk
have
done
to
provoke
hatred
a
hatred
capable
of
producing
an
ikiryō
he
had
been
irreproachably
well
conducted
unfailingly
courteous
and
earnestly
devoted
to
his
duties
the
mystery
troubled
rokubei
but
after
careful
reflection
he
decided
to
tell
everything
to
kihei
and
to
request
an
investigation
kihei
was
astounded
but
in
the
time
of
forty
years
he
had
never
had
the
least
reason
to
doubt
the
word
of
rokubei
he
therefore
summoned
his
wife
at
once
and
carefully
questioned
her
telling
her
at
the
same
time
what
the
sick
clerk
had
said
at
first
she
turned
pale
and
wept
but
after
some
hesitation
she
answered
frankly
i
suppose
that
what
the
new
clerk
has
said
about
the
is
true
though
i
really
tried
never
to
betray
by
word
or
look
the
dislike
which
i
could
not
help
feeling
for
him
you
know
that
he
is
very
skilful
in
commerce
very
shrewd
in
everything
that
he
does
and
you
have
given
him
much
authority
in
this
house
power
over
the
apprentices
and
the
servants
but
our
only
son
who
should
inherit
this
business
is
very
and
easily
deceived
and
i
have
long
been
thinking
that
your
clever
new
clerk
might
so
delude
our
boy
as
to
get
possession
of
all
this
property
indeed
i
am
certain
that
your
clerk
could
at
any
time
without
the
least
difficulty
and
without
the
least
risk
to
himself
ruin
our
business
and
ruin
our
son
and
with
this
certainty
in
my
mind
i
can
not
help
fearing
and
hating
the
man
i
have
often
and
often
wished
that
he
were
dead
i
have
even
wished
that
it
were
in
my
own
power
to
kill
him
yes
i
know
that
it
is
wrong
to
hate
any
one
in
such
a
way
but
i
could
not
check
the
feeling
night
and
day
i
have
been
wishing
evil
to
that
clerk
so
i
can
not
doubt
that
he
has
really
seen
the
thing
of
which
he
spoke
to
rokubei
how
absurd
of
you
exclaimed
kihei
to
torment
yourself
thus
up
to
the
present
time
that
clerk
has
done
no
single
thing
for
which
he
could
be
blamed
and
you
have
caused
him
to
suffer
cruelly
now
if
i
should
send
him
away
with
his
uncle
to
another
town
to
establish
a
branch
business
could
you
not
endeavour
to
think
more
kindly
of
him
if
i
do
not
see
his
face
or
hear
his
voice
the
wife
answered
if
you
will
only
send
him
away
from
this
house
then
i
think
that
i
shall
be
able
to
conquer
my
hatred
of
him
try
to
do
so
said
kihei
for
if
you
continue
to
hate
him
as
you
have
been
hating
him
he
will
certainly
die
and
you
will
then
be
guilty
of
having
caused
the
death
of
a
man
who
has
done
us
nothing
but
good
he
has
been
in
every
way
a
most
excellent
servant
then
kihei
quickly
made
arrangements
for
the
establishment
of
a
branch
house
in
another
city
and
he
sent
rokubei
there
with
the
clerk
to
take
charge
and
thereafter
the
ceased
to
torment
the
young
man
who
soon
recovered
his
health

a
daikwan
in
the
province

his
clerks
entered
into
a
conspiracy
to
defraud
the
family
of
their
late
master
under
pretext
of
paying
some
of
the
daikwan
debts
they
took
possession
of
all
the
money
valuables
and
furniture
in
his
house
and
they
furthermore
prepared
a
false
report
to
make
it
appear
that
he
had
unlawfully
contracted
obligations
exceeding
the
worth
of
his
estate
this
false
report
they
sent
to
the
saishō
and
the
saishō
thereupon
issued
a
decree
banishing
the
widow
and
the
children
of
nomoto
from
the
province
of
echizen
for
in
those
times
the
family
of
a
daikwan
were
held
in
part
responsible
even
after
his
death
for
any
malfeasance
proved
against
him
but
at
the
moment
when
the
order
of
banishment
was
officially
announced
to
the
widow
of
nomoto
a
strange
thing
happened
to
a
in
the
house
she
was
seized
with
convulsions
and
shudderings
like
a
person
possessed
and
when
the
convulsions
passed
she
rose
up
and
cried
out
to
the
officers
of
the
saishō
and
to
the
clerks
of
her
late
master

by
those
in

i
vainly
put

infamous

how
could
you

the

bestowed
upon
you
as

to

my
property

to
disgrace
my
name
here
now
in
my
presence
let
the
accounts
of
my
office
and
of
my
house
be
made
and
let
a
servant
be
sent
for
the
books

the
metsuké

that
the
estimates
may
be
compared

the

astonishment

her
voice

her

the
voice
and
the
manner

the
guilty
clerks
turned
pale
but
the
representatives
of
the
saishō
at
once
commanded
that
the
desire
expressed
by
the
girl
should
be
fully
granted
all
the
of
the
office
were
promptly
placed
before
her
and
the
books
of
the
metsuké
were
brought
in
and
she
began
the
reckoning
without
making
a
single
error
she
went
through
all
the
accounts
writing
down
the
totals
and
correcting
every
false
entry
and
her
writing
as
she
wrote
was
seen
to
be
the
very
writing
of
nomoto
yajiyémon
now
this
reëxamination
of
the
accounts

only
proved
that
there
had

also
showed
that
there
had

to
ask
you
to
do
such
a
thing
yet
the
wish
for
it
is
like
a
fire
burning
in
my
breast
i
must
speak
it
before
i
die
my
dear
you
know
that
sooner
or
later
after
i
am
dead
they
will
want
you
to
take
another
wife
will
you
promise
me
can
you
promise
me
not
to
marry
again
only
that
hachiyémon
exclaimed
why
if
that
be
all
that
you
wanted
to
ask
for
your
wish
is
very
easily
granted
with
all
my
heart
i
promise
you
that
no
one
shall
ever
take
your
place
uréshiya
cried
from
her
couch
oh
how
happy
you
have
made
me
and
she
fell
back
dead
now
the
health
of
hachiyémon
appeared
to
fail
after
the
death
of
at
first
the
change
in
his
aspect
was
attributed
to
natural
grief
and
the
villagers
only
said
how
fond
of
her
he
must
have
been
but
as
the
months
went
by
he
grew
paler
and
weaker
until
at
last
he
became
so
thin
and
wan
that
he
looked
more
like
a
ghost
than
a
man
then
people
began
to
suspect
that
sorrow
alone
could
not
explain
this
sudden
decline
of
a
man
so
young
the
doctors
said
that
hachiyémon
was
not
suffering
from
any
known
form
of
disease
they
could
not
account
for
his
condition
but
they
suggested
that
it
might
have
been
caused
by
some
very
unusual
trouble
of
mind
parents
questioned
him
in
vain
he
had
no
cause
for
sorrow
he
said
other
than
what
they
already
knew
they
counselled
him
to
remarry
but
he
protested
that
nothing
could
ever
induce
him
to
break
his
promise
to
the
dead
thereafter
hachiyémon
continued
to
grow
visibly
weaker
day
by
day
and
his
family
despaired
of
his
life
but
one
day
his
mother
who
felt
sure
that
he
had
been
concealing
something
from
her
adjured
him
so
earnestly
to
tell
her
the
real
cause
of
his
decline
and
wept
so
bitterly
before
him
that
he
was
not
able
to
resist
her
entreaties
mother
he
said
it
is
very
difficult
to
speak
about
this
matter
either
to
you
or
to
any
one
and
perhaps
when
i
have
told
you
everything
you
will
not
be
able
to
believe
me
but
the
truth
is
that
can
find
no
rest
in
the
other
world
and
that
the
buddhist
services
repeated
for
her
have
been
said
in
vain
perhaps
she
will
never
be
able
to
rest
unless
i
go
with
her
on
the
long
black
journey
for
every
night
she
returns
and
lies
down
by
my
side
every
night
since
the
day
of
her
funeral
she
has
come
back
and
sometimes
i
doubt
if
she
be
really
dead
for
she
looks
and
acts
just
as
when
she
lived
except
that
she
talks
to
me
only
in
whispers
and
she
always
bids
me
tell
no
one
that
she
comes
it
may
be
that
she
wants
me
to
die
and
i
should
not
care
to
live
for
my
own
sake
only
but
it
is
true
as
you
have
said
that
my
body
really
belongs
to
my
parents
and
that
i
owe
to
them
the
first
duty
so
now
mother
i
tell
you
the
whole
truth
yes
every
night
she
comes
just
as
i
am
about
to
sleep
and
she
remains
until
dawn
as
soon
as
she
hears
the
she
goes
away
when
the
mother
of
hachiyémon
had
heard
these
things
she
was
greatly
alarmed
and
hastening
at
once
to
the
she
told
the
priest
all
that
her
son
had
confessed
and
begged
for
ghostly
help
the
priest
who
was
a
man
of
great
age
and
experience
listened
without
surprise
to
the
recital
and
then
said
to
her
it
is
not
the
first
time
that
i
have
known
such
a
thing
to
happen
and
i
think
that
i
shall
be
able
to
save
your
son
but
he
is
really
in
great
danger
i
have
seen
the
shadow
of
death
upon
his
face
and
if
return
but
once
again
he
will
never
behold
another
sunrise
whatever
can
be
done
for
him
must
be
done
quickly
say
nothing
of
the
matter
to
your
son
but
assemble
the
members
of
both
families
as
soon
as
possible
and
tell
them
to
come
to
the
temple
without
delay
for
your
son
sake
it
will
be
necessary
to
open
the
grave
of
so
the
relatives
assembled
at
the
temple
and
when
the
priest
had
obtained
their
consent
to
the
opening
of
the
sepulchre
he
led
the
way
to
the
cemetery
then
under
his
direction
the
tombstone
of
was
shifted
the
grave
opened
and
the
coffin
raised
and
when
the
had
been
removed
all
present
were
startled
for
sat
before
them
with
a
smile
upon
her
face
seeming
as
comely
as
before
the
time
of
her
sickness
and
there
was
not
any
sign
of
death
upon
her
but
when
the
priest
told
his
assistants
to
lift
the
dead
woman
out
of
the
coffin
the
astonishment
changed
to
fear
for
the
corpse
was
to
the
touch
and
still
flexible
as
in
life
notwithstanding
the
squatting
posture
in
which
it
had
remained
so
long
it
was
borne
to
the
mortuary
chapel
and
there
the
priest
with
a
traced
upon
the
brow
and
breast
and
limbs
of
the
body
the
sanscrit
characters
of
certain
holy
talismanic
words
and
he
performed
a
for
the
spirit
of
before
suffering
her
corpse
to
be
restored
to
the
ground
illustration
she
never
again
visited
her
husband
and
hachiyémon
gradually
recovered
his
health
and
strength
but
whether
he
always
kept
his
promise
the
japanese
does
not
say
footnote
the
japanese
dead
are
placed
in
a
sitting
posture
in
the
coffin
which
is
almost
square
in
form
story
of
a
fly
illustration
about
two
hundred
years
ago
there
lived
in
kyoto
a
merchant
named
kazariya
kyūbei
his
shop
was
in
the
street
called
teramachidōri
a
little
south
of
the
shimabara
thoroughfare
he
had
a
named
tama
a
native
of
the
province
of
wakasa
tama
was
kindly
treated
by
kyūbei
and
his
wife
and
appeared
to
be
sincerely
attached
to
them
but
she
never
cared
to
dress
nicely
like
other
girls
and
whenever
she
had
a
holiday
she
would
go
out
in
her
notwithstanding
that
she
had
been
given
several
pretty
robes
after
she
had
been
in
the
service
of
kyūbei
for
about
five
years
he
one
day
asked
her
why
she
never
took
any
pains
to
look
neat
tama
blushed
at
the
reproach
implied
by
this
question
and
answered
respectfully
when
my
parents
died
i
was
a
very
little
girl
and
as
they
had
no
other
child
it
became
my
duty
to
have
the
buddhist
services
performed
on
their
behalf
at
that
time
i
could
not
obtain
the
means
to
do
so
but
i
resolved
to
have
their
mortuary
tablets
placed
in
the
temple
called
jōrakuji
and
to
have
the
rites
performed
so
soon
as
i
could
earn
the
money
required
and
in
order
to
fulfil
this
resolve
i
have
tried
to
be
saving
of
my
money
and
my
clothes
perhaps
i
have
been
too
saving
as
you
have
found
me
negligent
of
my
person
but
i
have
already
been
able
to
put
by
about
one
hundred
of
silver
for
the
purpose
which
i
have
mentioned
and
hereafter
i
will
try
to
appear
before
you
looking
neat
so
i
beg
that
you
will
kindly
excuse
my
past
negligence
and
rudeness
kyūbei
was
touched
by
this
simple
confession
and
he
spoke
to
the
girl
kindly
assuring
her
that
she
might
consider
herself
at
liberty
thenceforth
to
dress
as
she
pleased
and
commending
her
filial
piety
soon
after
this
conversation
the
maid
tama
was
able
to
have
the
tablets
of
her
parents
placed
in
the
temple
jōrakuji
and
to
have
the
appropriate
services
performed
of
the
money
which
she
had
saved
she
thus
expended
seventy
and
the
remaining
thirty
she
asked
her
mistress
to
keep
for
her
but
early
in
the
following
winter
tama
was
suddenly
taken
ill
and
after
a
brief
sickness
she
died
on
the
eleventh
day
of
the
first
month
of
the
fifteenth
year
of
genroku
kyūbei
and
his
wife
were
much
grieved
by
her
death
now
about
ten
days
later
a
very
large
fly
came
into
the
house
and
began
to
fly
round
and
round
the
head
of
kyūbei
this
surprised
kyūbei
because
no
flies
of
any
kind
appear
as
a
rule
during
the
period
of
greatest
cold
and
the
larger
kinds
of
flies
are
seldom
seen
except
in
the
warm
season
the
fly
annoyed
kyūbei
so
persistently
that
he
took
the
trouble
to
catch
it
and
put
it
out
of
the
house
being
careful
the
while
to
injure
it
in
no
way
for
he
was
a
devout
buddhist
it
soon
came
back
again
and
was
again
caught
and
thrown
out
but
it
entered
a
third
time
kyūbei
wife
thought
this
a
strange
thing
i
wonder
she
said
if
it
is
tama
for
the
dead
particularly
those
who
pass
to
the
state
of
gaki
sometimes
return
in
the
form
of
insects
kyūbei
laughed
and
made
answer
perhaps
we
can
find
out
by
marking
it
he
caught
the
fly
and
slightly
nicked
the
tips
of
its
wings
with
a
pair
of
scissors
after
which
he
carried
it
to
a
considerable
distance
from
the
house
and
let
it
go
next
day
it
returned
kyūbei
still
doubted
whether
its
return
had
any
ghostly
significance
he
caught
it
again
painted
its
wings
and
body
with
beni
rouge
carried
it
away
from
the
house
to
a
much
greater
distance
than
before
and
set
it
free
but
two
days
later
it
came
back
all
red
and
kyūbei
ceased
to
doubt
i
think
it
is
tama
he
said
she
wants
something
but
what
does
she
want
the
wife
responded
i
have
still
thirty
of
her
savings
perhaps
she
wants
us
to
pay
that
money
to
the
temple
for
a
buddhist
service
on
behalf
of
her
spirit
tama
was
always
very
anxious
about
her
next
birth
as
she
spoke
the
fly
fell
from
the
paper
window
on
which
it
had
been
resting
kyūbei
picked
it
up
and
found
that
it
was
dead
thereupon
the
husband
and
wife
resolved
to
go
to
the
temple
at
once
and
to
pay
the
girl
money
to
the
priests
they
put
the
body
of
the
fly
into
a
little
box
and
took
it
along
with
them
jiku
shōnin
the
chief
priest
of
the
temple
on
hearing
the
story
of
the
fly
decided
that
kyūbei
and
his
wife
had
acted
rightly
in
the
matter
then
jiku
shōnin
performed
a
service
on
behalf
of
the
spirit
of
tama
and
over
the
body
of
the
fly
were
recited
the
eight
rolls
of
the
sûtra
and
the
box
containing
the
body
of
the
fly
was
buried
in
the
grounds
of
the
temple
and
above
the
place
a
was
set
up
appropriately
inscribed
story
of
a
pheasant
illustration
in
the
toyama
district
of
the
province
of
bishū
there
formerly
lived
a
young
farmer
and
his
wife
their
farm
was
situated
in
a
lonely
place
among
the
hills
one
night
the
wife
dreamed
that
her
who
had
died
some
years
before
came
to
her
and
said
i
shall
be
in
great
danger
try
to
save
me
if
you
can
in
the
morning
she
told
this
to
her
husband
and
they
talked
about
the
dream
both
imagined
that
the
dead
man
wanted
something
but
neither
could
imagine
what
the
words
of
the
vision
signified
after
breakfast
the
husband
went
to
the
fields
but
the
wife
remained
at
her
loom
presently
she
was
startled
by
a
great
shouting
outside
she
went
to
the
door
and
saw
the
jitō
of
the
district
with
a
hunting
party
approaching
the
farm
while
she
stood
watching
them
a
pheasant
ran
by
her
into
the
house
and
she
suddenly
remembered
her
dream
perhaps
it
is
my
she
thought
to
herself
i
must
try
to
save
it
then
hurrying
in
after
the
bird
a
fine
male
pheasant
she
caught
it
without
any
difficulty
put
it
into
the
empty
and
covered
the
pot
with
the
lid
a
moment
later
some
of
the
jitō
followers
entered
and
asked
her
whether
she
had
seen
a
pheasant
she
answered
boldly
that
she
had
not
but
one
of
the
hunters
declared
that
he
had
seen
the
bird
run
into
the
house
so
the
party
searched
for
it
peeping
into
every
nook
and
corner
but
nobody
thought
of
looking
into
the
after
looking
everywhere
else
to
no
purpose
the
men
decided
that
the
bird
must
have
escaped
through
some
hole
and
they
went
away
when
the
farmer
came
home
his
wife
told
him
about
the
pheasant
which
she
had
left
in
the
so
that
he
might
see
it
when
i
caught
it
she
said
it
did
not
struggle
in
the
least
and
it
remained
very
quiet
in
the
pot
i
really
think
that
it
is
the
farmer
went
to
the
pot
lifted
the
lid
and
took
out
the
bird
it
remained
still
in
his
hands
as
if
tame
and
looked
at
him
as
if
accustomed
to
his
presence
one
of
its
eyes
was
blind
father
was
blind
of
one
eye
the
farmer
said
the
right
eye
and
the
right
eye
of
this
bird
is
blind
really
i
think
it
is
father
see
it
looks
at
us
just
as
father
used
to
do
poor
father
must
have
thought
to
himself
that
i
am
a
bird
better
to
give
my
body
to
my
children
for
food
than
to
let
the
hunters
have
and
that
explains
your
dream
of
last
night
he
added
turning
to
his
wife
with
an
evil
smile
as
he
wrung
the
pheasant
neck
at
the
sight
of
that
brutal
act
the
woman
screamed
and
cried
out
oh
you
wicked
man
oh
you
devil
only
a
man
with
the
heart
of
a
devil
could
do
what
you
have
done
and
i
would
rather
die
than
continue
to
be
the
wife
of
such
a
man
and
she
sprang
to
the
door
without
waiting
even
to
put
on
her
sandals
he
caught
her
sleeve
as
she
leaped
but
she
broke
away
from
him
and
ran
out
sobbing
as
she
ran
and
she
ceased
not
to
run
barefooted
till
she
reached
the
town
when
she
hastened
directly
to
the
residence
of
the
jitō
then
with
many
tears
she
told
the
jitō
everything
her
dream
of
the
night
before
the
hunting
and
how
she
had
hidden
the
pheasant
in
order
to
save
it
and
how
her
husband
had
mocked
her
and
had
killed
it
the
jitō
spoke
to
her
kindly
and
gave
orders
that
she
should
be
well
cared
for
but
he
commanded
his
officers
to
seize
her
husband
illustration
next
day
the
farmer
was
brought
up
for
judgment
and
after
he
had
been
made
to
confess
the
truth
concerning
the
killing
of
the
pheasant
sentence
was
pronounced
the
jitō
said
to
him
only
a
person
of
evil
heart
could
have
acted
as
you
have
acted
and
the
presence
of
so
perverse
a
being
is
a
misfortune
to
the
community
in
which
he
happens
to
reside
the
people
under
our
jurisdiction
are
people
who
respect
the
sentiment
of
filial
piety
and
among
them
you
can
not
be
suffered
to
live
so
the
farmer
was
banished
from
the
district
and
forbidden
ever
to
return
to
it
on
pain
of
death
but
to
the
woman
the
jitō
made
a
donation
of
land
and
at
a
later
time
he
caused
her
to
be
provided
with
a
good
husband

the
story
of
chūgorō
illustration
along
time
ago
there
lived
in
the
quarter
of
yedo
a
named
suzuki
whose
yashiki
was
situated
on
the
bank
of
the
yedogawa
not
far
from
the
bridge
called
and
among
the
retainers
of
this
suzuki
there
was
an
named
chūgorō
chūgorō
was
a
handsome
lad
very
amiable
and
clever
and
much
liked
by
his
comrades
for
several
years
chūgorō
remained
in
the
service
of
suzuki
conducting
himself
so
well
that
no
fault
was
found
with
him
but
at
last
the
other
discovered
that
chūgorō
was
in
the
habit
of
leaving
the
yashiki
every
night
by
way
of
the
garden
and
staying
out
until
a
little
before
dawn
at
first
they
said
nothing
to
him
about
this
strange
behaviour
for
his
absences
did
not
interfere
with
any
regular
duty
and
were
supposed
to
be
caused
by
some
but
after
a
time
he
began
to
look
pale
and
weak
and
his
comrades
suspecting
some
serious
folly
decided
to
interfere
therefore
one
evening
just
as
he
was
about
to
steal
away
from
the
house
an
elderly
retainer
called
him
aside
and
said
chūgorō
my
lad
we
know
that
you
go
out
every
night
and
stay
away
until
early
morning
and
we
have
observed
that
you
are
looking
unwell
we
fear
that
you
are
keeping
bad
company
and
injuring
your
health
and
unless
you
can
give
a
good
reason
for
your
conduct
we
shall
think
that
it
is
our
duty
to
report
this
matter
to
the
chief
officer
in
any
case
since
we
are
your
comrades
and
friends
it
is
but
right
that
we
should
know
why
you
go
out
at
night
contrary
to
the
custom
of
this
house
chūgorō
appeared
to
be
very
much
embarrassed
and
alarmed
by
these
words
but
after
a
short
silence
he
passed
into
the
garden
followed
by
his
comrade
when
the
two
found
themselves
well
out
of
hearing
of
the
rest
chūgorō
stopped
and
said
i
will
now
tell
you
everything
but
i
must
entreat
you
to
keep
my
secret
if
you
repeat
what
i
tell
you
some
great
misfortune
may
befall
me
it
was
in
the
early
part
of
last
spring
about
five
months
ago
that
i
first
began
to
go
out
at
night
on
account
of
a
one
evening
when
i
was
returning
to
the
yashiki
after
a
visit
to
my
parents
i
saw
a
woman
standing
by
the
riverside
not
far
from
the
main
gateway
she
was
dressed
like
a
person
of
high
rank
and
i
thought
it
strange
that
a
woman
so
finely
dressed
should
be
standing
there
alone
at
such
an
hour
but
i
did
not
think
that
i
had
any
right
to
question
her
and
i
was
about
to
pass
her
by
without
speaking
when
she
stepped
forward
and
pulled
me
by
the
sleeve
then
i
saw
that
she
was
very
young
and
handsome
you
not
walk
with
me
as
far
as
the
bridge
she
said
have
something
to
tell
you
her
voice
was
very
soft
and
pleasant
and
she
smiled
as
she
spoke
and
her
smile
was
hard
to
resist
so
i
walked
with
her
toward
the
bridge
and
on
the
way
she
told
me
that
she
had
often
seen
me
going
in
and
out
of
the
yashiki
and
had
taken
a
fancy
to
me
wish
to
have
you
for
my
husband
she
said
you
can
like
me
we
shall
be
able
to
make
each
other
very
happy
i
did
not
know
how
to
answer
her
but
i
thought
her
very
charming
as
we
neared
the
bridge
she
pulled
my
sleeve
again
and
led
me
down
the
bank
to
the
very
edge
of
the
river
in
with
me
she
whispered
and
pulled
me
toward
the
water
it
is
deep
there
as
you
know
and
i
became
all
at
once
afraid
of
her
and
tried
to
turn
back
she
smiled
and
caught
me
by
the
wrist
and
said
you
must
never
be
afraid
with
me
and
somehow
at
the
touch
of
her
hand
i
became
more
helpless
than
a
child
i
felt
like
a
person
in
a
dream
who
tries
to
run
and
can
not
move
hand
or
foot
into
the
deep
water
she
stepped
and
drew
me
with
her
and
i
neither
saw
nor
heard
nor
felt
anything
more
until
i
found
myself
walking
beside
her
through
what
seemed
to
be
a
great
palace
full
of
light
i
was
neither
wet
nor
cold
everything
around
me
was
dry
and
warm
and
beautiful
i
could
not
understand
where
i
was
nor
how
i
had
come
there
the
woman
led
me
by
the
hand
we
passed
through
room
after
room
through
ever
so
many
rooms
all
empty
but
very
fine
until
we
entered
into
a
of
a
thousand
mats
before
a
great
alcove
at
the
farther
end
lights
were
burning
and
cushions
laid
as
for
a
feast
but
i
saw
no
guests
she
led
me
to
the
place
of
honour
by
the
alcove
and
seated
herself
in
front
of
me
and
said
is
my
home
do
you
think
that
you
could
be
happy
with
me
here
as
she
asked
the
question
she
smiled
and
i
thought
that
her
smile
was
more
beautiful
than
anything
else
in
the
world
and
out
of
my
heart
i
answered
in
the
same
moment
i
remembered
the
story
of
urashima
and
i
imagined
that
she
might
be
the
daughter
of
a
god
but
i
feared
to
ask
her
any
questions
presently
came
in
bearing
and
many
dishes
which
they
set
before
us
then
she
who
sat
before
me
said
shall
be
our
bridal
night
because
you
like
me
and
this
is
our
we
pledged
ourselves
to
each
other
for
the
time
of
seven
existences
and
after
the
banquet
we
were
conducted
to
a
bridal
chamber
which
had
been
prepared
for
us
it
was
yet
early
in
the
morning
when
she
awoke
me
and
said
dear
one
you
are
now
indeed
my
husband
but
for
reasons
which
i
can
not
tell
you
and
which
you
must
not
ask
it
is
necessary
that
our
marriage
remain
secret
to
keep
you
here
until
daybreak
would
cost
both
of
us
our
lives
therefore
do
not
i
beg
of
you
feel
displeased
because
i
must
now
send
you
back
to
the
house
of
your
lord
you
can
come
to
me
again
and
every
night
hereafter
at
the
same
hour
that
we
first
met
wait
always
for
me
by
the
bridge
and
you
will
not
have
to
wait
long
but
remember
above
all
things
that
our
marriage
must
be
a
secret
and
that
if
you
talk
about
it
we
shall
probably
be
separated
forever
i
promised
to
obey
her
in
all
things
remembering
the
fate
of
urashima
and
she
conducted
me
through
many
rooms
all
empty
and
beautiful
to
the
entrance
there
she
again
took
me
by
the
wrist
and
everything
suddenly
became
dark
and
i
knew
nothing
more
until
i
found
myself
standing
alone
on
the
river
bank
close
to
the
when
i
got
back
to
the
yashiki
the
temple
bells
had
not
yet
begun
to
ring
in
the
evening
i
went
again
to
the
bridge
at
the
hour
she
had
named
and
i
found
her
waiting
for
me
she
took
me
with
her
as
before
into
the
deep
water
and
into
the
wonderful
place
where
we
had
passed
our
bridal
night
and
every
night
since
then
i
have
met
and
parted
from
her
in
the
same
way
she
will
certainly
be
waiting
for
me
and
i
would
rather
die
than
disappoint
her
therefore
i
must
go
but
let
me
again
entreat
you
my
friend
never
to
speak
to
any
one
about
what
i
have
told
you
the
elder
was
surprised
and
alarmed
by
this
story
he
felt
that
chūgorō
had
told
him
the
truth
and
the
truth
suggested
unpleasant
possibilities
probably
the
whole
experience
was
an
illusion
and
an
illusion
produced
by
some
evil
power
for
a
malevolent
end
nevertheless
if
really
bewitched
the
lad
was
rather
to
be
pitied
than
blamed
and
any
forcible
interference
would
be
likely
to
result
in
mischief
so
the
answered
kindly
i
shall
never
speak
of
what
you
have
told
me
never
at
least
while
you
remain
alive
and
well
go
and
meet
the
woman
but
beware
of
her
i
fear
that
you
are
being
deceived
by
some
wicked
spirit
chūgorō
only
smiled
at
the
old
man
warning
and
hastened
away
several
hours
later
he
reentered
the
yashiki
with
a
strangely
dejected
look
did
you
meet
her
whispered
his
comrade
no
replied
chūgorō
she
was
not
there
for
the
first
time
she
was
not
there
i
think
that
she
will
never
meet
me
again
i
did
wrong
to
tell
you
i
was
very
foolish
to
break
my
promise
the
other
vainly
tried
to
console
him
chūgorō
lay
down
and
spoke
no
word
more
he
was
trembling
from
head
to
foot
as
if
he
had
caught
a
chill
when
the
temple
bells
announced
the
hour
of
dawn
chūgorō
tried
to
get
up
and
fell
back
senseless
he
was
evidently
sick
deathly
sick
a
chinese
physician
was
summoned
why
the
man
has
no
blood
exclaimed
the
doctor
after
a
careful
examination
there
is
nothing
but
water
in
his
veins
it
will
be
very
difficult
to
save
him
what
maleficence
is
this
everything
was
done
that
could
be
done
to
save
chūgorō
life
but
in
vain
he
died
as
the
sun
went
down
then
his
comrade
related
the
whole
story
ah
i
might
have
suspected
as
much
exclaimed
the
doctor
no
power
could
have
saved
him
he
was
not
the
first
whom
she
destroyed
who
is
she
or
what
is
she
the
asked
a
illustration
no
she
has
been
haunting
this
river
from
ancient
time
she
loves
the
blood
of
the
young
a
a
no
no
if
you
were
to
see
her
under
that
bridge
by
daylight
she
would
appear
to
you
a
very
loathsome
creature
but
what
kind
of
a
creature
simply
a
frog
a
great
and
ugly
frog

military
service
a
woman
diary
illustration
recently
there
was
put
into
my
hands
a
somewhat
remarkable
manuscript
seventeen
long
narrow
sheets
of
soft
paper
pierced
with
a
silken
string
and
covered
with
fine
japanese
characters
it
was
a
kind
of
diary
containing
the
history
of
a
woman
married
life
recorded
by
herself
the
writer
was
dead
and
the
diary
had
been
found
in
a
small
which
had
belonged
to
her
the
friend
who
lent
me
the
manuscript
gave
me
leave
to
translate
as
much
of
it
as
i
might
think
worth
publishing
i
have
gladly
availed
myself
of
this
unique
opportunity
to
present
in
english
the
thoughts
and
feelings
joys
and
sorrows
of
a
simple
woman
of
the
people
just
as
she
herself
recorded
them
in
the
frankest
possible
way
never
dreaming
that
any
foreign
eye
would
read
her
humble
and
touching
memoir
but
out
of
respect
to
her
gentle
ghost
i
have
tried
to
use
the
manuscript
in
such
a
way
only
as
could
not
cause
her
the
least
pain
if
she
were
yet
in
the
body
and
able
to
read
me
some
parts
i
have
omitted
because
i
thought
them
sacred
also
i
have
left
out
a
few
details
relating
to
customs
or
to
local
beliefs
that
the
western
reader
could
scarcely
understand
even
with
the
aid
of
notes
and
the
names
of
course
have
been
changed
otherwise
i
have
followed
the
text
as
closely
as
i
could
making
no
changes
of
phrase
except
when
the
japanese
original
could
not
be
adequately
interpreted
by
a
literal
rendering
in
addition
to
the
facts
stated
or
suggested
in
the
diary
itself
i
could
learn
but
very
little
of
the
writer
personal
history
she
was
a
woman
of
the
poorest
class
and
from
her
own
narrative
it
appears
that
she
remained
unmarried
until
she
was
nearly
thirty
a
younger
sister
had
been
married
several
years
previously
and
the
diary
does
not
explain
this
departure
from
custom
a
small
photograph
found
with
the
manuscript
shows
that
its
author
never
could
have
been
called
but
the
face
has
a
certain
pleasing
expression
of
shy
gentleness
her
husband
was
a
employed
in
one
of
the
great
public
offices
chiefly
for
night
duty
at
a
salary
of
ten
yen
per
month
in
order
to
help
him
to
meet
the
expenses
of
housekeeping
she
made
cigarettes
for
a
tobacco
dealer
the
manuscript
shows
that
she
must
have
been
at
school
for
some
years
she
could
write
the
very
nicely
but
she
had
not
learned
many
chinese
characters
so
that
her
work
resembles
the
work
of
a
schoolgirl
but
it
is
written
without
mistakes
and
skilfully
the
dialect
is
of
tōkyō
the
common
speech
of
the
city
people
full
of
idiomatic
expressions
but
entirely
free
from
coarseness
some
one
might
naturally
ask
why
this
poor
woman
so
much
occupied
with
the
constant
struggle
for
mere
existence
should
have
taken
the
pains
to
write
down
what
she
probably
never
intended
to
be
read
i
would
remind
such
a
questioner
of
the
old
japanese
teaching
that
literary
composition
is
the
best
medicine
for
sorrow
and
i
would
remind
him
also
of
the
fact
that
even
among
the
poorest
classes
poems
are
still
composed
upon
all
occasions
of
joy
or
pain
the
latter
part
of
the
diary
was
written
in
lonely
hours
of
illness
and
i
suppose
that
she
then
wrote
chiefly
in
order
to
keep
her
thoughts
composed
at
a
time
when
solitude
had
become
dangerous
for
her
a
little
before
her
death
her
mind
gave
way
and
these
final
pages
probably
represent
the
last
brave
struggle
of
the
spirit
against
the
hopeless
weakness
of
the
flesh
i
found
that
the
manuscript
was
inscribed
on
the
outside
sheet
with
the
title
a
story
of
old
times
according
to
circumstances
the
word
may
signify
either
long
ago
in
reference
to
past
centuries
or
old
times
in
reference
to
one
own
past
life
the
latter
is
the
obvious
meaning
in
the
present
case
on
the
evening
of
the
day
of
the
ninth
month
of
the
year
of
meiji
man
of
the
opposite
house
came
and
asked
as
for
the
eldest
daughter
of
this
family
is
it
agreeable
that
she
be
disposed
of
in
marriage
then
the
answer
was
given
even
though
the
matter
were
agreeable
our
no
preparation
for
such
an
event
has
yet
been
made
the
man
of
the
opposite
house
said
but
as
no
preparation
is
needed
in
this
case
will
you
not
honourably
give
her
to
the
person
for
whom
i
speak
he
is
said
to
be
a
very
steady
man
and
he
is
years
of
age
as
i
thought
your
eldest
girl
to
be
about
i
proposed
her
to
him
no
she
is
years
old
was
answered
ah
that
being
the
case
i
must
again
speak
to
the
other
party
and
i
shall
honourably
consult
with
you
after
i
have
seen
him
so
saying
the
man
went
away
next
evening
the
man
came
again
this
time
with
the
wife
of
friend
of
the
and
said
the
other
party
is
satisfied
so
if
you
are
willing
the
match
can
be
made
father
replied
as
the
two
are
both
of
them
they
should
have
the
same
nature
so
i
think
that
no
harm
can
come
of
it
the
asked
then
how
would
it
be
to
arrange
for
the
father
said
i
suppose
that
everything
really
depends
upon
the
formed
in
previous
states
of
well
then
i
beg
that
you
will
honourably
meet
us
evening
at
the
house
of
okada
thus
the
betrothal
promise
was
given
on
both
sides
the
person
of
the
opposite
house
wanted
me
to
go
with
him
next
evening
to
okada
but
i
said
that
i
wished
to
go
with
my
mother
only
as
from
the
time
of
taking
such
a
first
step
one
could
not
either
retreat
or
advance
when
i
went
with
mother
to
the
house
we
were
welcomed
in
with
the
words
then
my
future
husband
and
i
greeted
each
other
for
the
first
time
but
somehow
i
felt
so
much
ashamed
that
i
could
not
look
at
him
then
said
to
proposed
now
that
you
have
nobody
to
consult
with
at
home
would
it
not
be
well
for
you
to
snatch
your
luck
where
you
find
it
as
the
proverb
says
wa
the
answer
was
made
as
for
me
i
am
well
satisfied
but
i
do
not
know
what
the
feeling
may
be
on
the
other
side
if
it
be
honourably
deigned
to
take
me
as
it
is
honourably
known
that
i
am
i
said
the
said
the
matter
being
so
what
would
be
a
good
day
for
the
wedding
answered
though
i
can
be
at
home
perhaps
the
first
day
of
the
tenth
month
would
be
a
better
day
but
at
once
said
as
there
is
cause
for
anxiety
about
the
house
being
unoccupied
while
is
absent
would
perhaps
be
the
better
day
would
it
not
though
at
first
that
seemed
to
me
much
too
soon
i
presently
remembered
that
the
next
day
was
a
perfectly
fortunate
day
so
i
gave
my
consent
and
we
went
home
when
i
told
father
he
was
not
pleased
he
said
that
it
was
too
soon
and
that
a
delay
of
at
least
three
or
four
days
ought
to
have
been
allowed
also
he
said
that
the
direction
was
not
lucky
and
that
other
conditions
were
not
favourable
i
said
but
i
have
already
promised
and
i
can
not
now
ask
to
have
the
day
changed
indeed
it
would
be
a
great
pity
if
a
thief
were
to
enter
the
house
in
his
absence
as
for
the
matter
of
the
direction
being
unlucky
even
though
i
should
have
to
die
on
that
account
i
would
not
complain
for
i
should
die
in
my
own
husband
and
i
added
i
shall
be
too
busy
to
call
on
goto
so
i
must
go
there
now
i
went
to
goto
but
when
i
saw
him
i
felt
afraid
to
say
exactly
what
i
had
come
to
say
i
suggested
it
only
by
telling
him
i
have
to
go
to
a
strange
house
goto
immediately
asked
as
an
honourable
after
hesitating
i
answered
at
last
yes
what
kind
of
a
person
goto
asked
i
answered
if
i
had
felt
myself
able
to
look
at
him
long
enough
to
form
any
opinion
i
would
not
have
put
mother
to
the
trouble
of
going
with
me
elder
sister
he
exclaimed
then
what
was
the
use
of
going
to
see
him
at
all
but
he
added
in
a
more
pleasant
tone
let
me
wish
you
luck
anyhow
i
said
it
will
be
and
i
returned
home
now
the
appointed
day
having
come
the
day
of
the
ninth
month
i
had
so
much
to
do
that
i
did
not
know
how
i
should
ever
be
able
to
get
ready
and
as
it
had
been
raining
for
several
days
the
roadway
was
very
bad
which
made
matters
worse
for
me
though
luckily
no
rain
fell
on
that
day
i
had
to
buy
some
little
things
and
i
could
not
well
ask
mother
to
do
anything
for
me
much
as
i
wished
for
her
help
because
her
feet
had
become
very
weak
by
reason
of
her
great
age
so
i
got
up
very
early
and
went
out
alone
and
did
the
best
i
could
nevertheless
it
was
two
in
the
afternoon
before
i
got
everything
ready
then
i
had
to
go
to
the
to
have
my
hair
dressed
and
to
go
to
the
all
of
which
took
time
and
when
i
came
back
to
dress
i
found
that
no
message
had
yet
been
received
from
and
i
began
to
feel
a
little
anxious
just
after
we
had
finished
supper
the
message
came
i
had
scarcely
time
to
say
to
all
then
i
went
out
leaving
my
home
behind
forever
and
walked
with
mother
to
the
house
of
there
i
had
to
part
even
from
mother
and
the
wife
of
taking
charge
of
me
i
accompanied
her
to
the
house
of
in
funamachi
the
wedding
ceremony
of
the
having
been
performed
without
any
difficulty
and
the
time
of
the
having
come
more
quickly
than
i
had
expected
the
guests
all
returned
home
so
we
two
were
left
for
the
first
time
each
alone
with
the
other
sitting
face
to
face
my
heart
beat
wildly
and
i
felt
abashed
in
such
a
way
as
could
not
be
expressed
by
means
of
ink
and
paper
indeed
what
i
felt
can
be
imagined
only
by
one
who
remembers
leaving
her
parents
home
for
the
first
time
to
become
a
bride
a
in
a
strange
house
afterward
at
the
hour
of
meals
i
felt
very
much
distressed
two
or
three
days
later
the
father
of
my
husband
former
wife
was
visited
me
and
said
is
really
a
good
man
a
moral
steady
man
but
as
he
is
also
very
particular
about
small
matters
and
inclined
to
find
fault
you
had
better
always
be
careful
to
try
to
please
him
now
as
i
had
been
carefully
watching
my
husband
ways
from
the
beginning
i
knew
that
he
was
really
a
very
strict
man
and
i
resolved
so
to
conduct
myself
in
all
matters
as
never
to
cross
his
will
the
fifth
day
of
the
tenth
month
was
the
day
for
our
and
for
the
first
time
we
went
out
together
calling
at
goto
on
the
way
after
we
left
goto
the
weather
suddenly
became
bad
and
it
began
to
rain
then
we
borrowed
a
paper
umbrella
which
we
used
as
an
and
though
i
was
very
uneasy
lest
any
of
my
former
neighbours
should
see
us
walking
thus
together
we
luckily
reached
my
parents
house
and
made
our
visit
of
duty
without
any
trouble
at
all
while
we
were
in
the
house
the
rain
fortunately
stopped
on
the
ninth
day
of
the
same
month
i
went
with
him
to
the
theatre
for
the
first
time
we
visited
the
engiza
at
akasaka
and
saw
a
performance
by
the
yamaguchi
company
on
the
eighth
day
of
the
eleventh
month
we
made
a
visit
to
and
also
went
to
the
shinto
temple
of
the
during
this
last
month
of
the
year
i
made
new
spring
robes
for
my
husband
and
myself
then
i
learned
for
the
first
time
how
pleasant
such
work
was
and
i
felt
very
happy
on
the
day
we
visited
the
temple
of
and
walked
about
the
grounds
there
on
the
eleventh
day
of
the
first
month
of
the
year
called
at
okada
on
the
twelfth
day
we
paid
a
visit
to
goto
and
had
a
pleasant
time
there
on
the
ninth
day
of
the
second
month
we
went
to
the
mizaki
theatre
to
see
the
play
on
our
way
to
the
theatre
we
met
unexpectedly
and
he
went
with
us
but
unluckily
it
began
to
rain
as
we
were
returning
home
and
we
found
the
roads
very
muddy
on
the
day
of
the
same
month
we
had
our
photograph
taken
at
amano
on
the
day
of
the
third
month
we
went
to
the
haruki
theatre
and
saw
the
play
during
the
month
it
was
agreed
that
all
of
us
friends
and
should
make
up
a
party
and
enjoy
our
together
but
this
could
not
be
managed
on
the
tenth
day
of
the
fourth
month
at
nine
in
the
morning
we
two
went
out
for
a
walk
we
first
visited
the
shōkonsha
at
kudan
thence
we
walked
to
uyéno
park
and
from
there
we
went
to
asakusa
and
visited
the
kwannon
temple
and
we
also
prayed
at
the
monzéki
thence
we
had
intended
to
go
round
to
but
we
thought
that
it
would
be
better
to
have
dinner
first
so
we
went
to
an
while
we
were
dining
we
heard
such
a
noise
of
shouting
and
screaming
that
we
thought
there
was
a
great
quarrel
outside
but
the
trouble
was
really
caused
by
a
fire
in
one
of
the
shows
the
fire
spread
quickly
even
while
we
were
looking
at
it
and
nearly
all
the
in
that
street
were
burnt
up
we
left
the
soon
after
and
walked
about
the
asakusa
grounds
looking
at
things
follows
in
the
original
the
text
of
a
little
poem
composed
by
the
writer

been
taken
across
the
i
strangely
met
at
the
temple
of
with
a
person
whom
i
had
never
seen
before
because
of
this
meeting
our
relation
is
now
even
more
than
the
relation
of
husband
and
wife
and
my
first
anxious
doubt
for
how
long
having
passed
away
my
mind
has
become
clear
as
the
sumida
river
indeed
we
are
now
like
a
pair
of
always
together
and
i
even
think
that
i
deserve
to
be
envied
to
see
the
flowers
we
went
out
but
more
than
the
pleasure
of
viewing
a
whole
shore
in
blossom
is
the
pleasure
that
i
now
desire
always
to
dwell
with
this
person
dearer
to
me
than
any
flower
until
we
enter
the
that
we
may
so
remain
together
i
supplicate
the
gods
then
we
crossed
the
azuma
bridge
on
our
homeward
way
and
we
went
by
steamer
to
the
kaichō
festival
of
the
temple
of
the
and
prayed
that
love
and
concord
should
continue
always
between
ourselves
and
our
brothers
and
sisters
it
was
after
seven
that
evening
when
we
got
home
on
the
day
of
the
same
month
we
went
to
the
on
the
second
day
of
the
fifth
month
we
visited
the
gardens
at
ōkubo
to
see
the
azaleas
in
blossom
on
the
sixth
day
of
the
same
month
we
went
to
see
a
display
of
fireworks
at
the
shōkonsha
so
far
we
had
never
had
any
words
between
us
nor
any
disagreement
and
i
had
ceased
to
feel
bashful
when
we
went
out
visiting
or
now
each
of
us
seemed
to
think
only
of
how
to
please
the
other
and
i
felt
sure
that
nothing
would
ever
separate
us
may
our
relation
always
be
thus
happy
the
eighteenth
day
of
the
sixth
month
being
the
festival
of
the
we
were
invited
to
my
father
house
but
as
the
did
not
come
to
dress
my
hair
at
the
proper
time
i
was
much
annoyed
however
i
went
with
younger
to
father
presently
married
also
came
and
we
had
a
pleasant
time
in
the
evening
of
joined
us
and
last
of
all
came
my
husband
for
whom
i
had
been
waiting
with
anxious
impatience
and
there
was
one
thing
that
made
me
very
glad
often
when
he
and
i
were
to
go
out
together
i
had
proposed
that
we
should
put
on
the
new
spring
robes
which
i
had
made
but
he
had
as
often
refused
preferring
to
wear
his
old
now
however
he
wore
the
new
one
having
felt
obliged
to
put
it
on
because
of
invitation
all
of
us
being
thus
happily
assembled
the
party
became
more
and
more
enjoyable
and
when
we
had
at
last
to
say
we
only
regretted
the
shortness
of
the
summer
night
these
are
the
poems
which
we
composed

the

two

in

alas
that
the
time
of
our
happy
converse
should
be
only
one
short
summer
night
on
the
fifth
day
of
the
seventh
month
went
to
the
where
harimadayū
was
then
reciting
and
we
heard
him
recite
the
jōruri
called
sanjūsangendō
on
the
first
day
of
the
eighth
month
we
went
to
the
buddhist
temple
of
asakusa
kwannon
to
pray
that
day
being
the
first
anniversary
of
the
death
of
my
husband
former
wife
afterward
we
went
to
an
near
the
azuma
bridge
for
dinner
and
while
we
were
there
just
about
the
hour
of
noon
an
earthquake
took
place
being
close
to
the
river
the
house
rocked
very
much
and
i
was
greatly
frightened
remembering
that
when
we
went
to
asakusa
before
in
the
time
of
cherry
blossoms
we
had
seen
a
big
fire
this
earthquake
made
me
feel
anxious
i
wondered
whether
lightning
would
come
next
about
two
we
left
the
and
went
to
the
asakusa
park
from
there
we
went
by
to
kanda
and
we
stopped
awhile
at
a
cool
place
in
kanda
to
rest
ourselves
on
our
way
home
we
called
at
father
and
it
was
after
nine
when
we
got
back
the
fifteenth
day
of
the
same
month
was
the
festival
of
the
and
goto
my
sister
and
the
younger
sister
of
goto
came
to
the
house
i
had
hoped
that
we
could
all
go
to
the
temple
together
but
that
morning
my
husband
had
taken
a
little
too
much
wine
so
we
had
to
go
without
him
after
worshipping
at
the
temple
we
went
to
goto
house
and
i
stopped
there
awhile
before
returning
home
in
the
ninth
month
on
the
occasion
of
the
higan
festival
i
went
alone
to
the
buddhist
temple
to
pray
on
the
day
of
the
tenth
month
a
came
from
shidzuoka
i
wanted
to
take
her
to
the
theatre
the
next
day
but
she
was
obliged
to
leave
tōkyō
early
in
the
morning
however
my
husband
and
i
went
to
the
ryūsei
theatre
on
the
following
evening
and
we
saw
the
play
called
bidan
on
the
day
of
the
sixth
month
i
began
to
sew
a
kimono
which
father
had
asked
me
to
make
for
him
but
i
felt
ill
and
could
not
do
much
however
i
was
able
to
finish
the
work
on
the
first
day
of
the
new
year
now
we
were
very
happy
because
of
the
child
that
was
to
be
born
and
i
thought
how
proud
and
glad
my
parents
would
be
at
having
a
grandchild
for
the
first
time
on
the
tenth
day
of
the
fifth
month
i
went
out
with
mother
to
worship
and
also
to
visit
sengakuji
there
we
saw
the
tombs
of
the
shi
rōnin
and
many
relics
of
their
history
we
returned
by
railroad
taking
the
train
from
shinagawa
to
shinjiku
at
i
parted
from
mother
and
i
got
home
by
six
on
the
eighth
day
of
the
sixth
month
at
four
in
the
afternoon
a
boy
was
born
both
mother
and
child
appeared
to
be
as
well
as
could
be
wished
and
the
child
much
resembled
my
husband
and
its
eyes
were
large
and
black
but
i
must
say
that
it
was
a
very
small
child
for
though
it
ought
to
have
been
born
in
the
eighth
month
it
was
born
indeed
in
the
sixth
at
seven
in
the
evening
of
the
same
day
when
the
time
came
to
give
the
child
some
medicine
we
saw
by
the
light
of
the
lamp
that
he
was
looking
all
about
with
his
big
eyes
wide
open
during
that
night
the
child
slept
in
my
mother
bosom
as
we
had
been
told
that
he
must
be
kept
very
warm
because
he
was
only
a
child
it
was
decided
that
he
should
be
kept
in
the
bosom
by
day
as
well
as
by
night
next
day
the
ninth
day
of
the
sixth
month
at
six
in
the
afternoon
he
suddenly
died
is
the
time
of
pleasure
and
quickly
turns
to
pain
and
whatsoever
is
born
must
necessarily
that
indeed
is
a
true
saying
about
this
world
only
for
one
day
to
be
called
a
mother
to
have
a
child
born
only
to
see
it
die
surely
i
thought
if
a
child
must
die
within
two
days
after
birth
it
were
better
that
it
should
never
be
born
from
the
twelfth
to
the
sixth
month
i
had
been
so
ill
then
at
last
i
had
obtained
some
ease
and
joy
at
the
birth
of
a
son
and
i
had
received
so
many
congratulations
about
my
good
fortune
and
nevertheless
he
was
dead
indeed
i
suffered
great
grief
on
the
tenth
day
of
the
sixth
month
the
funeral
took
place
at
the
temple
called
senpukuji
in
ōkubo
and
a
small
tomb
was
erected
the
poems
composed
at
that
time
were
the
following

wo
i
could
only
have
known
ah
this
parting
with
the
flower
for
which
i
would
so
gladly
have
given
my
own
life
has
left
my
sleeves
wet
with
the
dew
samidaré
ya
shimérigachi
naru
sodé
no
tamoto
wo
the
month
of
rain
all
things
become
damp
the
ends
of
my
sleeves
are
some
little
time
afterward
people
told
me
that
if
i
planted
the
upside
down
another
misfortune
of
this
kind
would
not
come
to
pass
i
had
a
great
many
sorrowful
doubts
about
doing
such
a
thing
but
at
last
on
the
ninth
day
of
the
eighth
month
i
had
the
reversed
on
the
eighth
day
of
the
ninth
month
we
went
to
the
akasaka
theatre
on
the
eighteenth
day
of
the
tenth
month
i
went
by
myself
to
the
haruki
theatre
in
hongō
to
see
the
play
of
there
having
carelessly
lost
my
i
had
to
remain
until
after
everybody
else
had
left
then
i
was
at
last
able
to
get
my
sandals
and
to
go
home
but
the
night
was
so
black
that
i
felt
very
lonesome
on
the
way
on
the
day
of
the
in
the
first
month
i
was
talking
with
hori
aunt
and
the
wife
of
our
friend
uchimi
when
i
suddenly
felt
a
violent
pain
in
my
breast
and
being
frightened
i
tried
to
reach
a
talisman
of
suitengū
which
was
lying
upon
the
wardrobe
but
in
the
same
moment
i
fell
senseless
under
kind
treatment
i
soon
came
to
myself
again
but
i
was
ill
for
a
long
time
after
the
tenth
day
of
the
fourth
month
being
the
holiday
we
arranged
to
meet
at
father
i
was
to
go
there
first
with
jiunosuké
a
and
there
wait
for
my
husband
who
had
to
go
to
the
office
that
morning
for
a
little
while
he
met
us
at
father
house
about
eight
then
the
three
of
us
went
out
together
to
look
at
the
streets
we
passed
through
kōjimachi
to
nakatamachi
and
went
by
way
of
the
to
the
and
thence
from
ginzadōri
by
way
of
the
to
uyéno
after
looking
at
things
there
we
again
went
to
the
but
then
i
felt
so
tired
that
i
proposed
to
return
and
my
husband
agreed
as
he
also
was
very
tired
but
jiunosuké
said
as
i
do
not
want
to
miss
this
chance
to
see
the
i
must
go
on
to
ginza
so
there
we
said
to
him
and
we
went
to
a
little
where
we
were
served
with
fried
fish
and
as
luck
would
have
it
we
got
a
good
chance
to
see
the
from
that
very
house
we
did
not
get
back
home
that
evening
until
six
from
the
middle
of
the
fourth
month
i
had
much
sorrow
on
account
of
a
matter
relating
to
my
sister
tori
matter
is
not
on
the
nineteenth
day
of
the
eighth
month
of
the
year
of
meiji
my
second
child
was
born
almost
painlessly
a
girl
and
we
named
her
hatsu
we
invited
to
the
all
those
who
had
helped
us
at
the
time
of
the
child
birth
mother
afterwards
remained
with
me
for
a
couple
of
days
but
she
was
then
obliged
to
leave
me
because
my
sister
kō
was
suffering
from
severe
pains
in
the
chest
fortunately
my
husband
had
his
regular
vacation
about
the
same
time
and
he
helped
me
all
he
could
even
in
regard
to
washing
and
other
matters
but
i
was
often
greatly
troubled
because
i
had
no
woman
with
me
when
my
husband
vacation
was
over
mother
came
often
but
only
while
my
husband
was
away
the
days
period
of
thus
passed
but
mother
and
child
continued
well
up
to
the
time
of
one
hundred
days
after
my
daughter
birth
i
was
constantly
anxious
about
her
because
she
often
seemed
to
have
a
difficulty
in
breathing
but
that
passed
off
at
last
and
she
appeared
to
be
getting
strong
still
we
were
unhappy
about
one
matter
a
deformity
hatsu
had
been
born
with
a
double
thumb
on
one
hand
for
a
long
time
we
could
not
make
up
our
minds
to
take
her
to
a
hospital
in
order
to
have
an
operation
performed
but
at
last
a
woman
living
near
our
house
told
us
of
a
very
skilful
surgeon
in
the
quarter
of
shinjiku
and
we
decided
to
go
to
him
my
husband
held
the
child
on
his
lap
during
the
operation
i
could
not
bear
to
see
the
operation
and
i
waited
in
the
next
room
my
heart
full
of
pain
and
fear
wondering
how
the
matter
would
end
but
when
all
was
over
the
little
one
did
not
appear
to
suffer
any
pain
and
she
took
the
breast
as
usual
a
few
minutes
after
so
the
matter
ended
more
fortunately
than
i
had
thought
possible
at
home
she
continued
to
take
her
milk
as
before
and
seemed
as
if
nothing
had
been
done
to
her
little
body
but
as
she
was
so
very
young
we
were
afraid
that
the
operation
might
in
some
way
cause
her
to
be
sick
by
way
of
precaution
i
went
with
her
to
the
hospital
every
day
for
about
three
weeks
but
she
showed
no
sign
of
sickness
on
the
third
day
of
the
third
month
of
the
year
on
the
occasion
of
the
we
received
presents
of
and
of
both
from
father
house
and
from
goto
also
the
customary
gifts
of
congratulation
a
chest
of
drawers
a
and
a
lit
we
ourselves
on
the
same
occasion
bought
for
her
a
teacup
stand
a
lacquered
tray
and
some
other
little
things
both
goto
and
jiunosuké
came
to
see
us
on
that
day
and
we
had
a
very
happy
gathering
on
the
third
day
of
the
fourth
month
we
visited
the
temple
shrine
in
the
district
of
to
pray
for
the
health
on
the
day
of
the
fourth
month
hatsu
appeared
to
be
unwell
so
i
wanted
to
have
her
examined
by
a
doctor
a
doctor
promised
to
come
the
same
morning
but
he
did
not
come
and
i
waited
for
him
in
vain
all
that
day
next
day
again
i
waited
but
he
did
not
come
toward
evening
hatsu
became
worse
and
seemed
to
be
suffering
great
pain
in
her
breast
and
i
resolved
to
take
her
to
a
doctor
early
next
morning
all
through
that
night
i
was
very
uneasy
about
her
but
at
daybreak
she
seemed
to
be
better
so
i
went
out
alone
taking
her
on
my
back
and
walked
to
the
office
of
a
doctor
in
akasaka
but
when
i
asked
to
have
the
child
examined
i
was
told
that
i
must
wait
as
it
was
not
yet
the
regular
time
for
seeing
patients
while
i
was
waiting
the
child
began
to
cry
worse
than
ever
before
she
would
not
take
the
breast
and
i
could
do
nothing
to
soothe
her
either
by
walking
or
resting
so
that
i
was
greatly
troubled
at
last
the
doctor
came
and
began
to
examine
her
and
in
the
same
moment
i
noticed
that
her
crying
grew
feebler
and
that
her
lips
were
becoming
paler
and
paler
then
as
i
could
not
remain
silent
seeing
her
thus
i
had
to
ask
how
is
her
condition
she
can
not
live
until
evening
he
answered
but
could
you
not
give
her
medicine
i
asked
if
she
could
drink
it
he
replied
i
wanted
to
go
back
home
at
once
and
send
word
to
my
husband
and
to
my
father
house
but
the
shock
had
been
too
much
for
me
all
my
strength
suddenly
left
me
fortunately
a
kind
old
woman
came
to
my
aid
and
carried
my
umbrella
and
other
things
and
helped
me
to
get
into
a
jinrikisha
so
that
i
was
able
to
return
home
by
jinrikisha
then
i
sent
a
man
to
tell
my
husband
and
my
father
mita
wife
came
to
help
me
and
with
her
assistance
everything
possible
was
done
to
help
the
child
still
my
husband
did
not
come
back
but
all
our
pain
and
trouble
was
in
vain
so
on
the
second
day
of
the
fifth
month
of
the
year
my
child
set
out
on
her
journey
to
the
jūmanokudō
never
to
return
to
this
world
and
we
her
father
and
mother
were
yet
living
though
we
had
caused
her
death
by
neglecting
to
have
her
treated
by
a
skilled
doctor
this
thought
made
us
both
sorrow
greatly
and
we
often
reproached
ourselves
in
vain
but
the
day
after
her
death
the
doctor
said
to
us
even
if
that
disease
had
been
treated
from
the
beginning
by
the
best
possible
means
your
child
could
not
have
lived
more
than
about
a
week
if
she
had
been
ten
or
eleven
years
old
she
might
possibly
have
been
saved
by
an
operation
but
in
this
case
no
operation
could
have
been
attempted
the
child
was
too
young
then
he
explained
to
us
that
the
child
had
died
from
a
thus
all
the
hopes
that
we
had
and
all
the
pains
that
we
took
in
caring
for
her
and
all
the
pleasure
of
watching
her
grow
during
those
nine
months
all
were
in
vain
but
we
two
were
at
last
able
to
find
some
ease
from
our
sorrow
by
reflecting
that
our
relation
to
this
child
from
the
time
of
some
former
life
must
have
been
very
slight
and
weak
in
the
loneliness
of
that
weary
time
i
tried
to
express
my
heart
by
writing
some
verses
after
the
manner
of
the
story
of
miyagino

in
this
house
it
was
that
i
married
him
well
i
remember
the
day
five
years
ago
here
was
born
the
the
loved
one
whom
we
hoped
to
rear
caring
then
no
longer
for
my
person
heedless
of
how
i
dressed
when
i
went
out
thinking
only
of
how
to
bring
her
up
i
lived
how
pitiless
this
doom
of
mine
never
had
i
even
dreamed
that
such
a
thing
could
befall
me
my
only
thoughts
were
as
to
how
my
hatsu
could
best
be
reared
when
she
grows
up
i
thought
soon
we
shall
find
her
a
good
husband
to
make
her
life
happy
so
never
going
out
for
i
studied
only
how
to
care
for
my
little
one
how
to
love
and
to
cherish
my
husband
and
my
hatsu
vain
now
alas
this
joy
of
living
only
for
her
once
having
known
the
delight
of
the
relation
of
mother
and
child
deign
to
think
of
the
heart
of
the
mother
who
sees
her
child
die
before
her
of
the
foregoing
is
addressed
to
the
spirit
of
the
dead
translator
while
husband
and
wife
each
clasping
the
hands
of
the
other
make
lament
together
if
any
one
pausing
at
the
entrance
should
listen
to
their
sorrow
surely
the
paper
window
would
be
moistened
by
tears
from
about
the
time
of
hatsu
death
the
law
concerning
funerals
was
changed
for
the
better
and
permission
was
given
for
the
burning
of
corpses
in
ōkubo
so
i
asked
namiki
to
have
the
body
sent
to
the
temple
of
which
his
family
had
always
been
parishioners
providing
that
there
should
be
no
legal
difficulty
about
the
matter
accordingly
the
funeral
took
place
at
monjōji
a
temple
belonging
to
the
asakusa
branch
of
the
hongwanji
and
the
ashes
were
there
interred
my
sister
kō
was
sick
in
bed
with
a
rather
bad
cold
at
the
time
of
hatsu
death
but
she
visited
us
very
soon
after
the
news
had
reached
her
and
she
called
again
a
few
days
later
to
tell
us
that
she
had
become
almost
well
and
that
we
had
no
more
cause
to
feel
anxious
about
her
as
for
myself
i
felt
a
dread
of
going
out
anywhere
and
i
did
not
leave
the
house
for
a
whole
month
but
as
custom
does
not
allow
one
to
remain
always
indoors
i
had
to
go
out
at
last
and
i
made
the
required
visit
to
father
and
to
my
sister
having
become
quite
ill
i
hoped
that
mother
would
be
able
to
help
me
but
kō
was
again
sick
and
yoshi
younger
sister
here
mentioned
for
the
first
and
mother
had
both
to
attend
her
constantly
so
i
could
get
no
aid
from
father
house
there
was
no
one
to
help
me
except
some
of
my
female
neighbours
who
attended
me
out
of
pure
kindness
when
they
could
spare
the
time
at
last
i
got
to
engage
a
good
old
woman
to
assist
me
and
under
her
kind
care
i
began
to
get
well
about
the
beginning
of
the
eighth
month
i
felt
much
stronger
on
the
fourth
day
of
the
ninth
month
my
sister
kō
died
of
consumption
it
had
been
agreed
beforehand
that
if
an
unexpected
matter
came
to
pass
my
younger
sister
yoshi
should
be
received
in
the
place
of
kō
as
found
it
inconvenient
to
live
altogether
alone
the
marriage
took
place
on
the
eleventh
day
of
the
same
month
and
the
usual
congratulations
were
offered
on
the
last
day
of
the
same
month
suddenly
died
we
found
ourselves
greatly
troubled
by
the
expenses
that
all
these
events
caused
us
when
i
first
heard
that
yoshi
had
been
received
so
soon
after
the
death
of
kō
i
was
greatly
displeased
but
i
kept
my
feelings
hidden
and
i
spoke
to
the
man
as
before
in
the
eleventh
month
goto
went
alone
to
sapporo
on
the
second
day
of
the
second
month
year
of
meiji
returned
to
tōkyō
and
on
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
same
month
he
went
away
again
to
the
hokkaidō
taking
yoshi
with
him
on
the
twentieth
day
of
the
second
month
at
six
in
the
morning
my
third
child
a
boy
was
born
both
mother
and
child
were
well
we
had
expected
a
girl
but
it
was
a
boy
that
was
born
so
when
my
husband
came
back
from
his
work
he
was
greatly
surprised
and
pleased
to
find
that
he
had
a
boy
but
the
child
was
not
well
able
to
take
the
breast
so
we
had
to
nourish
him
by
means
of
a
on
the
seventh
day
after
the
boy
birth
we
partly
shaved
his
head
and
in
the
evening
we
had
the
festival
but
this
time
all
by
ourselves
my
husband
had
caught
a
bad
cold
some
time
before
and
he
could
not
go
to
work
next
morning
as
he
was
coughing
badly
so
he
remained
in
the
house
early
in
the
morning
the
child
had
taken
his
milk
as
usual
but
about
ten
in
the
forenoon
he
seemed
to
be
suffering
great
pain
in
his
breast
and
he
began
to
moan
so
strangely
that
we
sent
a
man
for
a
doctor
unfortunately
the
doctor
that
we
asked
to
come
was
out
of
town
and
we
were
told
that
he
would
not
come
back
before
night
therefore
we
thought
that
it
would
be
better
to
send
at
once
for
another
doctor
and
we
sent
for
one
he
said
that
he
would
come
in
the
evening
but
about
two
in
the
afternoon
the
sickness
suddenly
became
worse
and
a
little
before
three
the
day
of
the
second
month
my
child
was
dead
having
lived
for
only
eight
days
i
thought
to
myself
that
even
if
this
new
misfortune
did
not
cause
my
husband
to
feel
an
aversion
for
me
thus
having
to
part
with
all
my
children
one
after
another
must
be
the
punishment
of
some
wrong
done
in
the
time
of
a
former
life
and
so
thinking
i
knew
that
my
sleeves
would
never
again
become
dry
that
the
rain
would
never
cease
that
never
again
in
this
world
would
the
sky
grow
clear
for
me
and
more
and
more
i
wondered
whether
my
husband
feelings
would
not
change
for
the
worse
by
reason
of
his
having
to
meet
such
trouble
over
and
over
again
on
my
account
i
felt
anxious
about
his
heart
because
of
what
already
was
in
my
own
nevertheless
he
only
repeated
the
words
itashikata
koré
from
the
decrees
of
heaven
there
is
no
escape
i
thought
that
i
should
be
better
able
to
visit
the
tomb
of
my
child
if
he
were
buried
in
some
temple
near
us
so
the
funeral
took
place
at
the
temple
called
in
ōkubo
and
the
ashes
were
buried
there
tanoshimi
mo
samété
hakanashi
haru
no
yumé
the
delight
having
perished
hopeless
i
remain
it
was
only
a
dream
of
spring
no
date
i
wonder
whether
it
was
because
of
the
sorrow
that
i
suffered
my
face
and
limbs
became
slightly
swollen
during
the
fortnight
after
my
boy
it
was
nothing
very
serious
after
all
and
it
soon
went
away
now
the
period
of
days
the
period
of
danger
is
past
here
the
poor
mother
diary
ends
the
closing
statement
regarding
the
time
of
days
from
the
birth
of
her
child
leaves
it
probable
that
these
last
lines
were
written
on
the
thirteenth
or
fourteenth
day
of
the
third
month
she
died
on
the
of
the
same
month
i
doubt
if
any
one
not
really
familiar
with
the
life
of
japan
can
fully
understand
this
simple
history
but
to
imagine
the
merely
material
conditions
of
the
existence
here
recorded
should
not
be
difficult
the
couple
occupying
a
tiny
house
of
two
rooms
one
room
of
six
mats
and
one
of
three
the
husband
earning
barely
per
month
the
wife
sewing
washing
cooking
outside
the
house
of
course
no
comfort
of
fire
even
during
the
period
of
greatest
cold
i
estimate
that
the
pair
must
have
lived
at
an
average
cost
of
about
seven
pence
a
day
not
including
their
pleasures
were
indeed
very
cheap
a
payment
of
twopence
admitted
them
to
theatres
or
to
and
their
was
done
on
foot
yet
even
these
diversions
were
luxuries
for
them
expenses
represented
by
the
necessary
purchase
of
clothing
or
by
the
obligation
of
making
presents
to
kindred
upon
the
occasion
of
a
marriage
or
a
birth
or
a
death
could
only
have
been
met
by
heroic
economy
now
it
is
true
that
thousands
of
poor
folk
in
tōkyō
live
still
more
cheaply
than
this
live
upon
a
much
smaller
income
than
per
month
and
nevertheless
remain
always
clean
neat
and
cheerful
but
only
a
very
strong
woman
can
easily
bear
and
bring
up
children
under
such
conditions
conditions
much
more
hazardous
than
those
of
the
harder
but
healthier
of
the
interior
and
as
might
be
supposed
the
weakly
fail
and
perish
in
multitude
readers
of
the
diary
may
have
wondered
at
the
eagerness
shown
by
so
shy
and
gentle
a
woman
to
become
thus
suddenly
the
wife
of
a
total
stranger
about
whose
character
she
knew
absolutely
nothing
a
majority
of
japanese
marriages
indeed
are
arranged
for
in
the
way
here
described
and
with
the
aid
of
a
but
the
circumstances
in
this
particular
case
were
exceptionally
discomforting
the
explanation
is
pathetically
simple
all
good
girls
are
expected
to
marry
and
to
remain
unmarried
after
a
certain
age
is
a
shame
and
a
reproach
the
dread
of
such
reproach
doubtless
impelled
the
writer
of
the
diary
to
snatch
at
the
first
chance
of
fulfilling
her
natural
destiny
she
was
already
years
old
another
such
chance
might
never
have
offered
itself
to
me
the
chief
significance
of
this
humble
confession
of
struggle
and
failure
is
not
in
the
utterance
of
anything
exceptional
but
in
the
expression
of
something
as
common
to
japanese
life
as
blue
air
and
sunshine
the
brave
resolve
of
the
woman
to
win
affection
by
docility
and
by
faultless
performance
of
duty
her
gratitude
for
every
small
kindness
her
childlike
piety
her
supreme
unselfishness
her
buddhist
interpretation
of
suffering
as
the
penalty
for
some
fault
committed
in
a
previous
life
her
attempts
to
write
poetry
when
her
heart
was
breaking
all
this
indeed
i
find
touching
and
more
than
touching
but
i
do
not
find
it
exceptional
the
traits
revealed
are
typical
typical
of
the
moral
nature
of
the
woman
of
the
people
perhaps
there
are
not
many
japanese
women
of
the
same
humble
class
who
could
express
their
personal
joy
and
pain
in
a
record
at
once
so
artless
and
pathetic
but
there
are
millions
of
such
women
inheriting
from
ages
and
ages
of
unquestioning
faith
a
like
conception
of
life
as
duty
and
an
equal
capacity
of
unselfish
attachment

to
feel
the
romance
of
this
legend
you
should
be
familiar
with
old
pictures
of
the

old
coloured

of
the
armoured
combatants

their
grim

the

kind
of

is
also
termed

got

the

i
can
vouch
for
their
accuracy
but
i
told
him
that

could
not

illustration
i
i
want
to
talk
about
japanese
fireflies
but
not
entomologically
if
you
are
interested
as
you
ought
to
be
in
the
scientific
side
of
the
subject
you
should
seek
enlightenment
from
a
japanese
professor
of
biology
now
lecturing
at
the
imperial
university
of
tōkyō
he
signs
himself
watasé
the
s
standing
for
the
personal
name
shozaburo
and
he
has
been
a
teacher
as
well
as
a
student
of
science
in
america
where
a
number
of
his
lectures
have
been
published
lectures
upon
animal
phosphorescence
animal
electricity
the
organs
of
insects
and
fishes
and
other
wonderful
topics
of
biology
he
can
tell
you
all
that
is
known
concerning
the
morphology
of
fireflies
the
physiology
of
fireflies
the
photometry
of
fireflies
the
chemistry
of
their
luminous
substance
the
spectroscopic
analysis
of
their
light
and
the
significance
of
that
light
in
terms
of
by
experiment
he
can
show
you
that
under
normal
conditions
of
temperature
and
environment
the
number
of
produced
by
one
species
of
japanese
firefly
averages
per
minute
and
that
the
rate
suddenly
rises
to
per
minute
if
the
insect
be
frightened
by
seizure
also
he
can
prove
to
you
that
another
and
smaller
kind
of
firefly
when
taken
in
the
hand
will
increase
the
number
of
its
to
upward
of
two
hundred
per
minute
he
suggests
that
the
light
may
be
of
some
protective
value
to
the
insect
like
the
warning
colours
of
sundry
nauseous
caterpillars
and
butterflies
because
the
firefly
has
a
very
bitter
taste
and
birds
appear
to
find
it
unpalatable
frogs
he
has
observed
do
not
mind
the
bad
taste
they
fill
their
cold
bellies
with
fireflies
till
the
light
shines
through
them
much
as
the
light
of
a
will
glow
through
a
porcelain
jar
but
whether
of
protective
value
or
not
the
tiny
dynamo
would
seem
to
be
used
in
a
variety
of
ways
as
a
phototelegraph
for
example
as
other
insects
converse
by
sound
or
by
touch
the
firefly
utters
its
emotion
in
luminous
pulsings
its
speech
is
a
language
of
light
i
am
only
giving
you
some
hints
about
the
character
of
the
professor
lectures
which
are
never
merely
technical
and
for
the
best
part
of
this
essay
of
mine
especially
that
concerning
the
capture
and
the
sale
of
fireflies
in
japan
i
am
indebted
to
some
delightful
lectures
which
he
delivered
last
year
to
japanese
audiences
in
tōkyō
ii
as
written
the
japanese
name
of
the
firefly
is
ideographically
composed
with
the
sign
for
fire
doubled
above
the
sign
for
insect
the
real
origin
of
the
word
is
nevertheless
doubtful
and
various
etymologies
have
been
suggested
some
scholars
think
that
the
appellation
anciently
signified
the
of
fire
while
others
believe
that
it
was
first
composed
with
syllables
meaning
star
and
drop
the
more
poetical
of
the
proposed
derivations
i
am
sorry
to
say
are
considered
the
least
probable
but
whatever
may
have
been
the
primal
meaning
of
the
word
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
romantic
quality
of
certain
still
given
to
the
insect
two
species
of
firefly
have
a
wide
distribution
in
japan
and
these
have
been
popularly
named
and
that
is
to
say
the
and
the
a
legend
avers
that
these
fireflies
are
the
ghosts
of
the
old
minamoto
and
taira
warriors
that
even
in
their
insect
shapes
they
remember
the
awful
of
the
twelfth
century
and
that
once
every
year
on
the
night
of
the
twentieth
day
of
the
fourth
month
they
fight
a
great
battle
on
the
uji
river
therefore
on
that
night
all
caged
fireflies
should
be
set
free
in
order
that
they
may
be
able
to
take
part
in
the
contest
the
is
the
largest
of
japanese
fireflies
the
largest
species
at
least
in
japan
proper
not
including
the
loochoo
islands
it
is
found
in
almost
every
part
of
the
country
from
kyūshū
to
ōshū
the
ranges
further
north
being
especially
common
in
yezo
but
it
is
found
also
in
the
central
and
southern
provinces
it
is
smaller
than
the
genji
and
emits
a
feebler
light
the
fireflies
commonly
sold
by
in
tōkyō
ōsaka
kyoto
and
other
cities
are
of
the
larger
species
japanese
observers
have
described
the
light
of
both
insects
as
the
tint
of
the
ordinary
japanese
infusion
when
the
leaf
is
of
good
quality
being
a
clear
greenish
yellow
but
the
light
of
a
fine
is
so
brilliant
that
only
a
keen
eye
can
detect
the
greenish
colour
at
first
sight
the
flash
appears
yellow
as
the
flame
of
a
and
its
vivid
brightness
has
not
been
overpraised
in
the
following
kagaribi
mo
hotaru
mo
hikaru
genji
kana
whether
it
be
a
glimmering
of
far
away
or
a
glimmering
of
fireflies
one
can
hardly
tell
ah
it
is
the
genji
although
the
appellations
and
are
still
in
general
use
both
insects
are
known
by
other
in
different
provinces
the
genji
is
called
or
great
firefly
or
or
and
or
firefly
of
uji
not
to
mention
such
picturesque
appellations
as
and
which
could
not
be
appreciated
by
the
average
western
reader
the
is
also
called
or
or
and
or
but
these
are
only
examples
chosen
at
random
in
almost
every
part
of
japan
there
is
a
special
for
the
insect
iii
there
are
many
places
in
japan
which
are
famous
for
fireflies
places
which
people
visit
in
summer
merely
to
enjoy
the
sight
of
the
fireflies
anciently
the
most
celebrated
of
all
such
places
was
a
little
valley
near
ishiyama
by
the
lake
of
ōmi
it
is
still
called
or
the
valley
of
fireflies
before
the
period
of
genroku
the
swarming
of
the
fireflies
in
this
valley
during
the
sultry
season
was
accounted
one
of
the
natural
marvels
of
the
country
the
fireflies
of
the
are
still
celebrated
for
their
size
but
that
wonderful
swarming
of
them
which
old
writers
described
is
no
longer
to
be
seen
there
at
present
the
most
famous
place
for
fireflies
is
in
the
neighbourhood
of
uji
in
yamashirō
uji
a
pretty
little
town
in
the
centre
of
the
celebrated
is
situated
on
the
ujigawa
and
is
scarcely
less
famed
for
its
fireflies
than
for
its
teas
every
summer
special
trains
run
from
kyōtō
and
ōsaka
to
uji
bringing
thousands
of
visitors
to
see
the
fireflies
but
it
is
on
the
river
at
a
point
several
miles
from
the
town
that
the
great
spectacle
is
to
be
witnessed
the
or
firefly
battle
the
stream
there
winds
between
hills
covered
with
vegetation
and
myriads
of
fireflies
dart
from
either
bank
to
meet
and
cling
above
the
water
at
moments
they
so
swarm
together
as
to
form
what
appears
to
the
eye
like
a
luminous
cloud
or
like
a
great
ball
of
sparks
the
cloud
soon
scatters
or
the
ball
drops
and
breaks
upon
the
surface
of
the
current
and
the
fallen
fireflies
drift
glittering
away
but
another
swarm
quickly
collects
in
the
same
locality
people
wait
all
night
in
boats
upon
the
river
to
watch
the
phenomenon
after
the
is
done
the
ujikawa
covered
with
the
still
sparkling
bodies
of
the
drifting
insects
is
said
to
appear
like
the
milky
way
or
as
the
japanese
more
poetically
call
it
the
river
of
heaven
perhaps
it
was
after
witnessing
such
a
spectacle
that
the
great
female
poet
chiyo
of
kaga
composed
these
verses
kawa
bakari
yami
wa
nagarété
hotaru
kana
which
may
be
thus
freely
rendered
is
it
the
river
only
or
is
the
darkness
itself
drifting
oh
the
fireflies
iv
many
persons
in
japan
earn
their
living
during
the
summer
months
by
catching
and
selling
fireflies
indeed
the
extent
of
this
business
entitles
it
to
be
regarded
as
a
special
industry
the
chief
centre
of
this
industry
is
the
region
about
ishiyama
in
goshū
by
the
lake
of
ōmi
a
number
of
houses
there
supplying
fireflies
to
many
parts
of
the
country
and
especially
to
the
great
cities
of
osaka
and
kyōtō
from
sixty
to
seventy
are
employed
by
each
of
the
principal
houses
during
the
busy
season
some
training
is
required
for
the
occupation
a
tyro
might
find
it
no
easy
matter
to
catch
a
hundred
fireflies
in
a
single
night
but
an
expert
has
been
known
to
catch
three
thousand
the
methods
of
capture
although
of
the
simplest
possible
kind
are
very
interesting
to
see
immediately
after
sunset
the
goes
forth
with
a
long
bamboo
pole
upon
his
shoulder
and
a
long
bag
of
brown
wound
like
a
girdle
about
his
waist
when
he
reaches
a
wooded
place
frequented
by
fireflies
usually
some
spot
where
willows
are
planted
on
the
bank
of
a
river
or
lake
he
halts
and
watches
the
trees
as
soon
as
the
trees
begin
to
twinkle
satisfactorily
he
gets
his
net
ready
approaches
the
most
luminous
tree
and
with
his
long
pole
strikes
the
branches
the
fireflies
dislodged
by
the
shock
do
not
immediately
take
flight
as
more
active
insects
would
do
under
like
circumstances
but
drop
helplessly
to
the
ground
where
their
light
always
more
brilliant
in
moments
of
fear
or
pain
renders
them
conspicuous
if
suffered
to
remain
upon
the
ground
for
a
few
moments
they
will
fly
away
but
the
catcher
picking
them
up
with
astonishing
quickness
using
both
hands
at
once
deftly
tosses
them
his
because
he
can
not
lose
the
time
required
to
put
them
one
by
one
into
the
bag
only
when
his
mouth
can
hold
no
more
does
he
drop
the
fireflies
unharmed
into
the
netting
thus
the
works
until
about
two
in
the
morning
the
old
japanese
hour
of
ghosts
at
which
time
the
insects
begin
to
leave
the
trees
and
seek
the
dewy
soil
there
they
are
said
to
bury
their
tails
so
as
to
remain
viewless
but
now
the
hunter
changes
his
tactics
taking
a
bamboo
broom
he
brushes
the
surface
of
the
turf
lightly
and
quickly
whenever
touched
or
alarmed
by
the
broom
the
fireflies
display
their
lanterns
and
are
immediately
nipped
and
bagged
a
little
before
dawn
the
hunters
return
to
town
at
the
the
captured
insects
are
sorted
as
soon
as
possible
according
to
the
brilliancy
of
their
light
the
more
luminous
being
the
then
they
are
put
into
boxes
or
cages
with
a
certain
quantity
of
moistened
grass
in
each
cage
from
one
hundred
to
two
hundred
fireflies
are
placed
in
a
single
cage
according
to
grade
to
these
cages
are
attached
small
wooden
tablets
inscribed
with
the
names
of
customers
such
as
hotel
proprietors
wholesale
and
retail
and
private
persons
who
have
ordered
large
quantities
of
fireflies
for
some
particular
festivity
the
boxes
are
despatched
to
their
destinations
by
nimble
messengers
for
goods
of
this
class
can
not
be
safely
intrusted
to
express
companies
great
numbers
of
fireflies
are
ordered
for
display
at
evening
parties
in
the
summer
season
a
large
japanese
usually
overlooks
a
garden
and
during
a
banquet
or
other
evening
entertainment
given
in
the
sultry
season
it
is
customary
to
set
fireflies

the

may
enjoy
the
sight
of
the
sparkling
purchase
largely
in
the
famous
dōtombori
of
ōsaka
there
is
a
house
where
myriads
of
fireflies
are
kept
in
a
large
space
enclosed
by
and
customers
of
this
house
are
permitted
to
enter
the
enclosure
and
capture
a
certain
number
of
fireflies
to
take
home
with
them
the
wholesale
price
of
living
fireflies
ranges
from
three
sen
per
hundred
up
to
thirteen
sen
per
hundred
according
to
season
and
quality
retail
dealers
sell
them
in
cages
and
in

the
price
of
a
cage
of
fireflies
ranges
from
three
sen
up
to
several
dollars
the
cheapest
kind
of
cage
containing
only
three
or
four
fireflies
is
scarcely
more
than
two
inches
square
but
the
costly
cages
veritable
marvels
of
bamboo
work
beautifully
decorated
are
as
large
as

houses
junks
can
be
bought
at
prices
ranging
from
thirty
sen
up
to
one

dead
or
alive
fireflies
are
worth
money
they
are
delicate
insects
and
they
live
but
a
short
time
in
confinement
great
numbers
die
in
the
and
one
celebrated
is
said
to
dispose
every
season
of
no
less
than
five
that
is
to
say
about
one
peck
of
dead
fireflies
which
are
sold
to
manufacturing
establishments
in
osaka
formerly
fireflies
were
used
much
more
than
at
present
in
the
manufacture
of
poultices
and
pills
and
in
the
preparation
of
drugs
peculiar
to
the
practice
of
chinese
medicine
even
some
curious
extracts
are
obtained
from
them
and
one
of
these
called
or
is
still
used
by
woodworkers
for
the
purpose
of
imparting
rigidity
to
objects
made
of
bent
bamboo
a
very
curious
chapter
on
might
be
written
by
somebody
learned
in
the
literature
the
queerest
part
of
the
subject
is
chinese
and
belongs
much
more
to
demonology
than
to
therapeutics
used
to
be
made
which
had
power
it
was
alleged
to
preserve
a
house
from
the
attacks
of
robbers
to
counteract
the
effect
of
any
poison
and
to
drive
away
the
hundred
devils
and
pills
were
made
with
which
were
believed
to
confer
invulnerability
one
kind
of
such
pills
being
called
or
pills
and
another
or
pills
v
as
a
business
is
comparatively
modern
but
as
a
diversion
is
a
very
old
custom
anciently
it
was
an
aristocratic
amusement
and
great
nobles
used
to
give
parties
in
this
busy
era
of
meiji
the
is
rather
an
amusement
for
children
than
for
folks
but
the
latter
occasionally
find
time
to
join
in
the
sport
all
over
japan
the
children
have
their
every
summer
moonless
nights
being
usually
chosen
for
such
expeditions
girls
follow
the
chase
with
paper
fans
boys
with
long
light
poles
to
the
ends
of
which
wisps
of
fresh
are
tied
when
struck
down
by
a
fan
or
a
wisp
the
insects
are
easily
secured
as
they
are
slow
to
take
wing
after
having
once
been
checked
in
actual
flight
while
hunting
the
children
sing
little
songs
supposed
to
attract
the
shining
prey
these
songs
differ
according
to
locality
and
the
number
of
them
is
wonderful
but
there
are
very
few
possessing
that
sort
of
interest
which
justifies
quotation
two
examples
will
probably
suffice

of
course
in
order
to

successfully
it
is
necessary
to
know
something
about
their
habits
and
on
this
subject
japanese
children
are
probably
better
informed
than
a
majority
of
my
readers
for
whom
the
following
notes
may
possess
a
novel
interest
fireflies
frequent
the
neighbourhood
of
water
and
like
to
circle
above
it
but
some
kinds
are
repelled
by
impure
or
stagnant
water
and
are
only
to
be
found
in
the
vicinity
of
clear
streams
or
lakes
the
shuns
swamps
ditches
or
foul
canals
while
the
seems
to
be
satisfied
with
any
water
all
fireflies
seek
by
preference
grassy
banks
shaded
by
trees
but
they
dislike
certain
trees
and
are
attracted
by
others
they
avoid
pine
trees
for
instance
and
they
will
not
light
upon
but
upon
willow
trees
especially
weeping
willows
they
gather
in
great
swarms
occasionally
on
a
summer
night
you
may
see
a
drooping
willow
so
covered
and
illuminated
with
fireflies
that
all
its
branches
appear
to
be
budding
fire
during
a
bright
moonlight
night
fireflies
keep
as
much
as
possible
in
shadow
but
when
pursued
they
fly
at
once
into
the
moonshine
where
their
shimmering
is
less
easily
perceived
lamplight
or
any
strong
artificial
light
drives
them
away
but
small
bright
lights
attract
them
they
can
be
lured
for
example
by
the
sparkling
of
a
small
piece
of
lighted
charcoal
or
by
the
glow
of
a
little
japanese
pipe
kindled
in
the
dark
but
the
lamping
of
a
single
lively
firefly
confined
in
a
bottle
or
cup
of
clear
glass
is
the
best
of
all
lures
as
a
rule
the
children
hunt
only
in
parties
for
obvious
reasons
in
former
years
it
would
have
been
deemed
foolhardy
to
go
alone
in
pursuit
of
fireflies
because
there
existed
certain
uncanny
beliefs
concerning
them
and
in
some
of
the
country
districts
these
beliefs
still
prevail
what
appear
to
be
fireflies
may
be
malevolent
spirits
or
or
kindled
to
delude
the
wayfarer
even
real
fireflies
are
not
always
to
be
trusted
the
weirdness
of
their
kinships
might
be
inferred
from
their
love
of
willow
trees
other
trees
have
their
particular
spirits
good
or
evil
hamadryads
or
goblins
but
the
willow
is
particularly
the
tree
of
the
dead
the
favourite
of
human
ghosts
any
firefly
may
be
a
ghost
who
can
tell
besides
there
is
an
old
belief
that
the
soul
of
a
person
still
alive
may
sometimes
assume
the
shape
of
a
firefly
and
here
is
a
little
story
that
was
told
me
in
izuno
one
cold
winter
night
a
young
shizoku
of
matsuë
while
on
his
way
home
from
a
was
surprised
to
perceive
a
hovering
above
the
canal
in
front
of
his
dwelling
wondering
that
such
an
insect
should
be
flying
abroad
in
the
season
of
snow
he
stopped
to
look
at
it
and
the
light
suddenly
shot
toward
him
he
struck
at
it
with
a
stick
but
it
darted
away
and
flew
into
the
garden
of
a
residence
adjoining
his
own
next
morning
he
made
a
visit
to
that
house
intending
to
relate
the
adventure
to
his
neighbours
and
friends
but
before
he
found
a
chance
to
speak
of
it
the
eldest
daughter
of
the
family
happening
to
enter
the
without
knowing
of
the
young
man
visit
uttered
a
cry
of
surprise
and
exclaimed
oh
how
you
startled
me
no
one
told
me
that
you
had
called
and
just
as
i
came
in
i
was
thinking
about
you
last
night
i
had
so
strange
a
dream
i
was
flying
in
my
dream
flying
above
the
canal
in
front
of
our
house
it
seemed
very
pleasant
to
fly
over
the
water
and
while
i
was
flying
there
i
saw
you
coming
along
the
bank
then
i
went
to
you
to
tell
you
that
i
had
learned
how
to
fly
but
you
struck
at
me
and
frightened
me
so
that
i
still
feel
afraid
when
i
think
of
after
hearing
this
the
visitor
thought
it
best
not
to
relate
his
own
experience
for
the
time
being
lest
the
coincidence
should
alarm
the
girl
to
whom
he
was
betrothed
vi
fireflies
have
been
celebrated
in
japanese
poetry
from
ancient
time
and
frequent
mention
of
them
is
made
in
early
classical
prose
one
of
the
chapters
of
the
famous
novel
for
example
written
either
toward
the
close
of
the
tenth
century
or
at
the
beginning
of
the
eleventh
is
entitled
fireflies
and
the
author
relates
how
a
certain
noble
person
was
enabled
to
obtain
one
glimpse
of
a
lady
face
in
the
dark
by
the
device
of
catching
and
suddenly
liberating
a
number
of
fireflies
the
first
literary
interest
in
fireflies
may
have
been
stimulated
if
not
aroused
by
the
study
of
chinese
poetry
even
every
japanese
child
knows
a
little
song
about
the
famous
chinese
scholar
who
in
the
time
of
his
struggles
with
poverty
studied
by
the
light
of
a
paper
bag
filled
with
fireflies
but
whatever
the
original
source
of
their
inspiration
japanese
poets
have
been
making
verses
about
fireflies
during
more
than
a
thousand
years
compositions
on
the
subject
can
be
found
in
every
form
of
japanese
poetry
but
the
greater
number
of
firefly
poems
are
in
the
briefest
of
all
measures
consisting
of
only
seventeen
syllables
modern
relating
to
the
firefly
are
legion
but
the
majority
of
these
written
in
the
popular
form
called
appear
to
consist
of
little
more
than
variants
of
one
old
classic
fancy
comparing
the
silent
burning
of
the
light
to
the
consuming
passion
that
is
never
uttered
perhaps
my
readers
will
be
interested
by
the
following
selection
of
firefly
poems
some
of
the
compositions
are

wonder

the
growth

life

of
that
which
has
been
called
the
development

organic
out

inorganic
existence
the
one
amazing
fact

organic
evolution
to
which
my

the
fact
that

substance
of
life
should
possess
the
latent
capacity
or
tendency
to
build
itself
into
complexities
incomprehensible
of
structure
the
power
of
that
substance
to
evolve
radiance
or
electricity
is
not
really
more
extraordinary
than
its
power
to
evolve
colour
and
that
a
noctiluca
or
a
luminous
centipede
or
a
firefly
should
produce
light
ought
not
to
seem
more
wonderful
than
that
a
plant
should
produce
blue
or
purple
flowers
but
the
biological
interpretation
of
the
phenomenon
leaves
me
wondering
just
as
much
as
before
at
the
particular
miracle
of
the
machinery
by
which
the
light
is
made
to
find
embedded
in
the
body
of
the
insect
a
microscopic
of
everything
comprised
under
the
technical
designation
of
an
electric
plant
would
not
be
nearly
so
wonderful
a
discovery
as
the
discovery
of
what
actually
exists
here
is
a
firefly
able
with
its
infinitesimal
dynamo
to
produce
a
pure
cold
light
at
one
part
of
the
cost
of
the
energy
expended
in
a
candle
flame
now
why
should
there
have
been
evolved
in
the
tail
of
this
tiny
creature
a
luminiferous
mechanism
at
once
so
elaborate
and
so
effective
that
our
greatest
physiologists
and
chemists
are
still
unable
to
understand
the
operation
of
it
and
our
best
electricians
impotent
to
conceive
the
possibility
of
imitating
it
why
should
the
living
tissues
crystallize
or
build
themselves
into
structures
of
such
stupefying
intricacy
and
beauty
as
the
visual
organs
of
an
ephemera
the
electrical
organs
of
a
gymnotus
or
the
luminiferous
organs
of
a
firefly
the
very
wonder
of
the
thing
forbids
me
to
imagine
gods
at
work
no
mere
god
could
ever
contrive
such
a
prodigy
as
the
eye
of
a
or
the
tail
of
a
firefly
biology
would
answer
thus
though
it
is
inconceivable
that
a
structure
like
this
should
have
been
produced
by
accumulated
effects
of
function
on
structure
yet
it
is
conceivable
that
successive
selections
of
favourable
variations
might
have
produced
it
and
no
follower
of
herbert
spencer
is
really
justified
in
wandering
further
but
i
can
not
rid
myself
of
the
notion
that
matter
in
some
blind
infallible
way
and
that
in
every
unit
of
living
substance
there
slumber
infinite
potentialities
simply
because
to
every
ultimate
atom
belongs
the
infinite
and
indestructible
experience
of
billions
of
vanished
universes

there
are
moments
in
life
when
truths
but
dimly
known
before
beliefs
first
vaguely
reached
through
multiple
processes
of
reasoning
suddenly
assume
the
vivid
character
of
emotional
convictions
such
an
experience
came
to
me
the
other
day
on
the
suruga
coast
while
resting
under
the
pines
that
fringed
the
beach
something
in
the
vital
warmth
and
luminous
peace
of
the
hour
some
quivering
rapture
of
wind
and
light
very
strangely
bestirred
an
old
belief
of
mine
the
belief
that
all
being
is
one
one
i
felt
myself
to
be
with
the
thrilling
of
breeze
and
the
racing
of
wave
with
every
flutter
of
shadow
and
flicker
of
sun
with
the
azure
of
sky
and
sea
with
the
great
green
hush
of
the
land
in
some
new
and
wonderful
way
i
found
myself
assured
that
there
never
could
have
been
a
beginning
that
there
never
could
be
an
end
nevertheless
the
ideas
of
the
moment
were
not
new
the
novelty
of
the
experience
was
altogether
in
the
peculiar
intensity
with
which
they
presented
themselves
making
me
feel
that
the
flashing
and
the
long
gray
and
the
shrilling
sémi
overhead
and
the
little
red
crabs
astir
under
the
roots
of
the
pines
were
all
of
them
brothers
and
sisters
i
seemed
to
understand
as
never
before
how
the
mystery
that
is
called
the
soul
of
me
must
have
quickened
in
every
form
of
past
existence
and
must
as
certainly
continue
to
behold
the
sun
for
other
millions
of
summers
through
eyes
of
other
countless
shapes
of
future
being
and
i
tried
to
think
the
long
slow
thoughts
of
the
long
gray
crickets
and
the
thoughts
of
the
darting
shimmering
dragonflies
and
the
thoughts
of
the
basking
trilling
cicadæ
and
the
thoughts
of
the
wicked
little
crabs
that
lifted
up
their
claws
from
between
the
roots
of
the
pines
illustration
presently
i
discovered
myself
wondering
whether
the
consequence
of
such
thoughts
could
have
anything
to
do
with
the
recombination
of
my
in
future
spheres
of
existence
for
thousands
of
years
the
east
has
been
teaching
that
what
we
think
or
do
in
this
life
really
decides
through
some
inevitable
formation
or
polarities
the
future
place
of
our
substance
and
the
future
state
of
our
sentiency
and
the
belief
is
worth
thinking
about
though
no
amount
of
thinking
can
enable
us
either
to
confirm
or
to
disprove
it
very
possibly
like
other
buddhist
doctrines
it
may
adumbrate
some
cosmic
truth
but
its
literal
assertions
i
doubt
because
i
must
doubt
the
power
ascribed
to
thought
by
the
whole
infinite
past
i
have
been
moulded
within
and
without
how
should
the
impulse
of
a
moment
reshape
me
against
the
weight
of
the
eternities
buddhism
indeed
answers
how
and
that
astounding
answer
is
irrefutable
but
i
doubt
anyhow
acts
and
thoughts
according
to
buddhist
doctrine
are
creative
visible
matter
is
made
by
acts
and
thoughts
even
the
universe
of
stars
and
all
that
has
form
and
name
and
all
the
conditions
of
existence
what
we
think
or
do
is
never
for
the
moment
only
but
for
measureless
time
it
signifies
some
force
directed
to
the
shaping
of
worlds
to
the
making
of
future
bliss
or
pain
remembering
this
we
may
raise
ourselves
to
the
zones
of
the
gods
ignoring
it
we
may
deprive
ourselves
even
of
the
right
to
be
reborn
among
men
and
may
doom
ourselves
though
innocent
of
the
crimes
that
cause
rebirth
in
hell
to
reënter
existence
in
the
form
of
animals
or
of
insects
or
of
goblins
so
it
depends
upon
ourselves
whether
we
are
to
become
insects
or
goblins
hereafter
and
in
the
buddhist
system
the
difference
between
insects
and
goblins
is
not
so
well
defined
as
might
be
supposed
the
belief
in
a
mysterious
relation
between
ghosts
and
insects
or
rather
between
spirits
and
insects
is
a
very
ancient
belief
in
the
east
where
it
now
assumes
innumerable
forms
some
unspeakably
horrible
others
full
of
weird
beauty
the
white
moth
of

not
impress
a
japanese
reader
as
novel
for

the
butterfly
figures
in
many
a
japanese
poem
and
legend
as
the
soul
of
a
lost
wife
the
thin
lament
is
perhaps
the
sorrowing
of
a
voice
once
human
the
strange
red
marks
upon
the
heads
of
cicadæ
are
characters
of

grasshoppers
are
the
horses
of
the
dead
all
these
are
to
be
pitied
with
the
pity
that
is
kin
to
love
but
the
noxious
and
dangerous
insects
represent
the
results
of
another
quality
of
karma

which
produces

and
demons

names
have
been
given
to
some
of
these
insects
as
for
example

to
the
and
to
a
gigantic
which
seizes
frogs
and
fish
and
devours
them
alive
thus
realizing
in
a
microcosmic
way
the
hideous
myth
of
the

flies
on
the
other
hand

especially
identified
with
the
world
of
hungry
ghosts
how
often
in

season
of

have
i
heard
some
persecuted
toiler
exclaim
no
hai
wa
gaki
no
yo
da
ne
the
flies
how
like
gaki
they
are
footnote
the
word
gaki
is
the
japanese
buddhist
rendering
of
the
sanscrit
term
preta
signifying
a
spirit
in
that
circle
or
state
of
torment
called
the
world
of
hungry
ghosts
ii
in
the
old
japanese
or
more
correctly
speaking
chinese
buddhist
literature
relating
to
the
gaki
the
sanscrit
names
of
the
gaki
are
given
in
a
majority
of
cases
but
some
classes
of
gaki
described
have
only
chinese
names
as
the
indian
belief
reached
japan
by
way
of
china
and
korea
it
is
likely
to
have
received
a
peculiar
colouring
in
the
course
of
its
journey
but
in
a
general
way
the
japanese
classification
of
gaki
corresponds
closely
to
the
indian
classification
of
the
pretas
the
place
of
gaki
in
the
buddhist
system
is
but
one
degree
removed
from
the
region
of
the
hells
or
jigokudō
the
lowest
of
all
the
states
of
existence
above
the
jigokudō
is
the
gakidō
or
world
of
hungry
spirits
above
the
gakidō
is
the
chikushōdō
or
world
of
animals
and
above
this
again
is
the
shuradō
a
region
of
perpetual
fighting
and
slaughter
higher
than
these
is
placed
the
ningendō
or
world
of
mankind
now
a
person
released
from
hell
by
exhaustion
of
the
karma
that
sent
him
there
is
seldom
reborn
at
once
into

zone
of
human
existence
but
must
patiently
work
his
way
upward
thither
through
all
the
intermediate
states
of
being
many
of
the
gaki
have
been
in
hell
but
there
are
gaki
also
who
have
not
been
in
hell
certain
kinds
or
degrees
of
sin
may
cause
a
person
to
be
reborn
as
a
gaki
immediately
after
having
died
in
this
world
only
the
greatest
degree
of
sin
condemns
the
sinner
directly
to
hell
the
second
degree
degrades
him
to
the
gakidō
the
third
causes
him
to
be
reborn
as
an
animal
japanese
buddhism
recognizes
principal
classes
of
gaki
roughly
counting
says
the
we
find
classes
of
gaki
but
should
we
attempt
to
distinguish
all
the
different
varieties
we
should
find
them
to
be
innumerable
the
classes
form
two
great
divisions
or
orders
one
comprises
all
that
is
to
say
all
hungry
spirits
who
remain
in
the
gakidō
proper
and
are
therefore
never
seen
by
mankind
the
other
division
is
called
or
dwellers
among
men
these
gaki
remain
always
in
this
world
and
are
sometimes
seen
there
is
yet
another
classification
of
gaki
according
to
the
character
of
their
penitential
torment
all
gaki
suffer
hunger
and
thirst
but
there
are
three
degrees
of
this
suffering
the
represent
the
first
degree
they
must
hunger
and
thirst
uninterruptedly
without
obtaining
any
nourishment
whatever
the
suffer
only
in
the
second
degree
they
are
able
to
feed
occasionally
upon
impure
substances
the
are
more
fortunate
they
can
eat
such
remains
of
food
as
are
thrown
away
by
men
and
also
the
offerings
of
food
set
before
the
images
of
the
gods
or
before
the
tablets
of
the
ancestors
the
last
two
classes
of
gaki
are
especially
interesting
because
they
are
supposed
to
meddle
with
human
affairs
before
modern
science
introduced
exact
knowledge
of
the
nature
and
cause
of
certain
diseases
buddhists
explained
the
symptoms
of
such
diseases
by
the
hypothesis
of
gaki
certain
kinds
of
intermittent
fever
for
example
were
said
to
be
caused
by
a
gaki
entering
the
human
body
for
the
sake
of
nourishment
and
warmth
at
first
the
patient
would
shiver
with
cold
because
the
gaki
was
cold
then
as
the
gaki
gradually
became
warm
the
chill
would
pass
to
be
succeeded
by
a
burning
heat
at
last
the
satiated
haunter
would
go
away
and
the
fever
disappear
but
upon
another
day
and
usually
at
an
hour
corresponding
to
that
of
the
first
attack
a
second
fit
of
ague
would
announce
the
return
of
the
gaki
other
zymotic
disorders
could
be
equally
well
explained
as
due
to
the
action
of
gaki
in
the
a
majority
of
the
kinds
of
gaki
are
associated
with
putrescence
disease
and
death
others
are
plainly
identified
with
insects
no
particular
kind
of
gaki
is
identified
by
name
with
any
particular
kind
of
insect
but
the
descriptions
suggest
conditions
of
and
such
suggestions
are
reënforced
by
a
knowledge
of
popular
superstitions
perhaps
the
descriptions
are
vague
in
the
case
of
such
spirits
as
the
or
the
or
the
or
the
or
the
or
the
or
the
or
the
or
perhaps
they
fly
into
lamps
the
who
devour
corpses
and
cause
pestilence
the
who
appear
by
night
as
wandering
fires
the
or
and
the
or
each
a
living
furnace
filled
with
flame
that
keeps
the
fluids
of
its
body
humming
like
a
boiling
pot
but
the
suggestion
of
the
following
excerpts
will
not
be
found
at
all
obscure
these
gaki
can
live
only
by
eating
the
wigs
of
false
hair
with
which
the
statues
of
certain
divinities
are
decorated
such
will
be
the
future
condition
of
persons
who
steal
objects
of
value
from
buddhist
temples
these
gaki
can
eat
only
street
filth
and
refuse
such
a
condition
is
the
consequence
of
having
given
putrid
or
unwholesome
food
to
priests
or
nuns
or
pilgrims
in
need
of
alms
these
are
the
eaters
of
the
refuse
of
and
of
the
clay
of
graves
they
are
the
spirits
of
men
who
despoiled
buddhist
temples
for
the
sake
of
gain
these
spirits
are
born
within
the
wood
of
trees
and
are
tormented
by
the
growing
of
the
grain
their
condition
is
the
result
of
having
cut
down
for
the
purpose
of
selling
the
timber
persons
who
cut
down
the
trees
in
buddhist
cemeteries
or
are
especially
likely
to
become
moths
flies
beetles
grubs
worms
and
other
unpleasant
creatures
seem
thus
to
be
indicated
but
some
kinds
of
gaki
can
not
be
identified
with
insects
for
example
the
species
called
or
these
can
exist
only
by
hearing
the
preaching
of
the
law
of
the
buddha
in
some
temple
while
they
hear
such
preaching
their
torment
is
assuaged
but
at
all
other
times
they
suffer
agonies
unspeakable
to
this
condition
are
liable
after
death
all
buddhist
priests
or
nuns
who
proclaim
the
law
for
the
mere
purpose
of
making
money
also
there
are
gaki
who
appear
sometimes
in
beautiful
human
shapes
such
are
the
spirits
of
lewdness
corresponding
in
some
sort
to
the
and
of
our
own
middle
ages
they
can
change
their
sex
at
will
and
can
make
their
bodies
as
large
or
as
small
as
they
please
it
is
impossible
to
exclude
them
from
any
dwelling
except
by
the
use
of
holy
charms
and
spells
since
they
are
able
to
pass
through
an
orifice
even
smaller
than
the
eye
of
a
needle
to
seduce
young
men
they
assume
beautiful
feminine
shapes
often
appearing
at
wine
parties
as
waitresses
or
dancing
girls
to
seduce
women
they
take
the
form
of
handsome
lads
this
state
of
is
a
consequence
of
lust
in
some
previous
human
existence
but
the
supernatural
powers
belonging
to
their
condition
are
results
of
meritorious
karma
which
the
evil
karma
could
not
wholly
counterbalance
even
concerning
the
however
it
is
plainly
stated
that
they
may
take
the
form
of
insects
though
wont
to
appear
in
human
shape
they
can
assume
the
shape
of
any
animal
or
other
creature
and
fly
freely
in
all
directions
of
space
or
keep
their
bodies
so
small
that
mankind
can
not
see
them
all
insects
are
not
necessarily
gaki
but
most
gaki
can
assume
the
form
of
insects
when
it
serves
their
purpose
footnote
abridged
from
the
a
full
translation
of
the
extraordinary
chapter
relating
to
the
gaki

nerves
rather
severely
footnote
the
following
story
of
a
is
typical
in
the
garden
of
a
samurai
named
satsuma
shichizaëmon
who
lived
in
the
village
of
echigawa
in
the
province
of
ōmi
there
was
a
very
old
énoki
the
énoki
or
celtis
chinensis
is
commonly
thought
to
be
a
from
ancient
times
the
ancestors
of
the
family
had
been
careful
never
to
cut
a
branch
of
this
tree
or
to
remove
any
of
its
leaves
but
shichizaëmon
who
was
very
one
day
announced
that
he
intended
to
have
the
tree
cut
down
during
the
following
night
a
monstrous
being
appeared
to
the
mother
of
shichizaëmon
in
a
dream
and
told
her
that
if
the
inoki
were
cut
down
every
member
of
the
household
should
die
but
when
this
warning
was
communicated
to
shichizaëmon
he
only
laughed
and
he
then
sent
a
man
to
cut
down
the
tree
no
sooner
had
it
been
cut
down
than
shichizaëmon
became
violently
insane
for
several
days
he
remained
furiously
mad
crying
out
at
intervals
the
tree
the
tree
the
tree
he
said
that
the
tree
put
out
its
branches
like
hands
to
tear
him
in
this
condition
he
died
soon
afterward
his
wife
went
mad
crying
out
that
the
tree
was
killing
her
and
she
died
screaming
with
fear
one
after
another
all
the
people
in
that
house
not
excepting
the
servants
went
mad
and
died
the
dwelling
long
remained
unoccupied
thereafter
no
one
daring
even
to
enter
the
garden
at
last
it
was
remembered
that
before
these
things
happened
a
daughter
of
the
satsuma
family
had
become
a
buddhist
nun
and
that
she
was
still
living
under
the
name
of
jikun
in
a
temple
at
yamashirō
this
nun
was
sent
for
and
by
request
of
the
villagers
she
took
up
her
residence
in
the
house
where
she
continued
to
live
until
the
time
of
her
death
daily
reciting
a
special
service
on
behalf
of
the
spirit
that
had
dwelt
in
the
tree
from
the
time
that
she
began
to
live
in
the
house
the
ceased
to
give
trouble
this
story
is
related
on
the
authority
of
the
priest
shungyō
who
said
that
he
had
heard
it
from
the
lips
of
the
nun
herself
iii
grotesque
as
these
beliefs
now
seem
to
us
it
was
not
unnatural
that
ancient
eastern
fancy
should
associate
insects
with
ghosts
and
devils
in
our
visible
world
there
are
no
other
creatures
so
wonderful
and
so
mysterious
and
the
true
history
of
certain
insects
actually
realizes
the
dreams
of
mythology
to
the
minds
of
primitive
men
the
mere
facts
of
must
have
seemed
uncanny
and
what
but
goblinry
or
magic
could
account
for
the
monstrous
existence
of
beings
so
similar
to
dead
leaves
or
to
flowers
or
to
joints
of
grass
that
the
keenest
human
sight
could
detect
their
presence
only
when
they
began
to
walk
or
to
fly
even
for
the
entomologist
of
insects
remain
the
most
incomprehensible
of
creatures
we
have
learned
from
him
that
they
must
be
acknowledged
the
most
successful
of
organized
beings
in
the
battle
for
existence
that
the
delicacy
and
the
complexity
of
their
structures
surpass
anything
ever
imagined
of
marvellous
before
the
age
of
the
microscope
that
their
senses
so
far
exceed
our
own
in
refinement
as
to
prove
us
deaf
and
blind
by
comparison
nevertheless
the
insect
world
remains
a
world
of
hopeless
enigmas
who
can
explain
for
us
the
mystery
of
the
eyes
of
a
myriad
facets
or
the
secret
of
the
ocular
brains
connected
with
them
do
those
astounding
eyes
perceive
the
ultimate
structure
of
matter
does
their
vision
pierce
opacity
after
the
manner
of
the
röntgen
rays
or
how
interpret
the
deadly
aim
of
that
which
plunges
its
ovipositor
through
solid
wood
to
reach
the
grub
embedded
in
the
grain
what
again
of
those
marvellous
ears
in
breasts
and
thighs
and
knees
and
feet
ears
that
hear
sounds
beyond
the
limit
of
human
audition
and
what
of
the
musical
structures
evolved
to
produce
such
fairy
melody
what
of
the
ghostly
feet
that
walk
upon
flowing
water
what
of
the
chemistry
that
kindles
the
firefly
lamp
making
the
cold
and
beautiful
light
that
all
our
electric
science
can
not
imitate
and
those
newly
discovered
incomparably
delicate
organs
for
which
we
have
yet
no
name
because
our
wisest
can
not
decide
the
nature
of
them
do
they
really
as
some
would
suggest
keep
the
informed
of
things
unknown
to
human
sense
visibilities
of
magnetism
odours
of
light
tastes
of
sound
even
the
little
that
we
have
been
able
to
learn
about
insects
fills
us
with
the
wonder
that
is
akin
to
fear
the
lips
that
are
hands
and
the
horns
that
are
eyes
and
the
tongues
that
are
drills
the
multiple
devilish
mouths
that
move
in
four
ways
at
once
the
living
scissors
and
saws
and
and
the
exquisite
elfish
weapons
which
no
human
skill
can
copy
even
in
the
finest
steel
what
superstition
of
old
ever
dreamed
of
sights
like
these
indeed
all
that
nightmare
ever
conceived
of
faceless
horror
and
all
that
ecstasy
ever
imagined
of
phantasmal
pulchritude
can
appear
but
vapid
and
void
by
comparison
with
the
stupefying
facts
of
entomology
but
there
is
something
spectral
something
alarming
in
the
very
beauty
of
insects
iv
whether
gaki
do
or
do
not
exist
there
is
at
least
some
shadowing
of
truth
in
the
eastern
belief
that
the
dead
become
insects
undoubtedly
our
human
dust
must
help
over
and
over
again
for
millions
of
ages
to
build
up
numberless
weird
shapes
of
life
but
as
to
that
question
of
my
revery
under
the
pine
trees
whether
present
acts
and
thoughts
can
have
anything
to
do
with
the
future
distribution
and
requickening
of
that
dust
whether
human
conduct
can
of
itself
predetermine
the
shapes
into
which
human
atoms
will
be
recast
no
reply
is
possible
i
doubt
but
i
do
not
know
neither
does
anybody
else
supposing
however
that
the
order
of
the
universe
were
really
as
buddhists
believe
and
that
i
knew
myself
foredoomed
by
reason
of
stupidities
in
this
existence
to
live
hereafter
the
life
of
an
insect
i
am
not
sure
that
the
prospect
would
frighten
me
there
are
insects
of
which
it
is
difficult
to
think
with
equanimity
but
the
state
of
an
independent
highly
organized
respectable
insect
could
not
be
so
very
bad
i
should
even
look
forward
with
some
pleasurable
curiosity
to
any
chance
of
viewing
the
world
through
the
marvellous
compound
eyes
of
a
beetle
an
ephemera
or
a
as
an
ephemera
indeed
i
might
enjoy
the
possession
of
three
different
kinds
of
eyes
and
the
power
to
see
colours
now
totally
unimaginable
estimated
in
degrees
of
human
time
my
life
would
be
short
a
single
summer
day
would
include
the
best
part
of
it
but
to
ephemeral
consciousness
a
few
minutes
would
appear
a
season
and
my
one
day
of
winged
existence
barring
possible
mishaps
would
be
one
unwearied
joy
of
dancing
in
golden
air
and
i
could
feel
in
my
winged
state
neither
hunger
nor
thirst
having
no
real
mouth
or
stomach
i
should
be
in
very
truth
a
nor
should
i
fear
to
enter
upon
the
much
less
ethereal
condition
of
a
i
should
then
have
to
bear
carnivorous
hunger
and
to
hunt
a
great
deal
but
even
after
the
fierce
joy
of
the
chase
can
indulge
themselves
in
solitary
meditation
besides
what
wings
would
then
be
mine
and
what
eyes
i
could
pleasurably
anticipate
even
the
certainty
of
becoming
an
and
so
being
able
to
run
and
to
slide
upon
water
though
children
might
catch
me
and
bite
off
my
long
fine
legs
but
i
think
that
i
should
better
enjoy
the
existence
of
a
sémi
a
large
and
lazy
cicada
basking
on
trees
sipping
only
dew
and
singing
from
dawn
till
dusk
of
course
there
would
be
perils
to
encounter
danger
from
hawks
and
crows
and
sparrows
danger
from
insects
of
prey
danger
from
bamboos
tipped
with
birdlime
by
naughty
little
boys
but
in
every
condition
of
life
there
must
be
risks
and
in
spite
of
the
risks
i
imagine
that
anacreon
uttered
little
more
than
the
truth
in
his
praise
of
the
cicada
thou
free
from
pain
having
flesh
without
blood
thou
art
nearly
equal
to
the
gods
in
fact
i
have
not
been
able
to
convince
myself
that
it
is
really
an
inestimable
privilege
to
be
reborn
a
human
being
and
if
the
thinking
of
this
thought
and
the
act
of
writing
it
down
must
inevitably
affect
my
next
rebirth
then
let
me
hope
that
the
state
to
which
i
am
destined
will
not
be
worse
than
that
of
a
cicada
or
of
a
climbing
the
cryptomerias
to
clash
my
tiny
cymbals
in
the
sun
or
haunting
with
soundless
flicker
of
amethyst
and
gold
some
holy
silence

comes

he
preaches
against
many

discourages

a
strange
dream
but
whenever
i
question
such
a
person
carefully
i
find
that
the
matter
can
be
explained
in
a
natural
way
only
once
in
my
life
i
had
a
queer
experience
which
i
could
not
easily
explain
i
was
then
in
kyūshū
a
young
novice
and
i
was
performing
my
gyō
the
pilgrimage
that
every
novice
has
to
make
one
evening
while
travelling
through
a
i
reached
a
little
village
where
there
was
a
temple
of
the
zen
sect
i
went
there
to
ask
for
lodging
according
to
our
rules
but
i
found
that
the
priest
had
gone
to
attend
a
funeral
at
a
village
several
miles
away
leaving
an
old
nun
in
charge
of
the
temple
the
nun
said
that
she
could
not
receive
me
during
the
absence
of
the
priest
and
that
he
would
not
come
back
for
seven
days
in
that
part
of
the
country
a
priest
was
required
by
custom
to
recite
the
sûtras
and
to
perform
a
buddhist
service
every
day
for
seven
days
in
the
house
of
a
dead
parishioner
i
said
that
i
did
not
want
any
food
but
only
a
place
to
sleep
moreover
i
pleaded
that
i
was
very
tired
and
at
last
the
old
nun
took
pity
on
me
she
spread
some
quilts
for
me
in
the
temple
near
the
altar
and
i
fell
asleep
almost
as
soon
as
i
lay
down
in
the
middle
of
the
night
a
very
cold
night
i
was
awakened
by
the
tapping
of
a
and
the
voice
of
somebody
chanting
the
close
to
where
i
was
lying
i
opened
my
eyes
but
the
temple
was
utterly
dark
so
dark
that
if
a
man
had
seized
me
by
the
nose
i
could
not
have
seen
him
wo
tsumarété
mo
and
i
wondered
that
anybody
should
be
tapping
the
and
chanting
in
such
darkness
but
though
the
sounds
seemed
at
first
to
be
quite
near
me
they
were
somewhat
faint
and
i
tried
to
persuade
myself
that
i
must
have
been
mistaken
that
the
priest
had
come
back
and
was
performing
a
service
in
some
other
part
of
the
temple
in
spite
of
the
tapping
and
chanting
i
fell
asleep
again
and
slept
until
morning
then
as
soon
as
i
had
washed
and
dressed
i
went
to
look
for
the
old
nun
and
found
her
after
thanking
her
for
her
kindness
i
ventured
to
remark
the
priest
came
back
last
night
did
not
she
answered
very
crossly
told
you
that
he
would
not
come
back
for
seven
days
more
pardon
me
i
said
mast
night
i
heard
somebody
chanting
the
and
beating
the
so
i
thought
that
the
priest
had
come
back
that
was
not
the
priest
she
exclaimed
was
the
i
asked
for
i
could
not
understand
her
she
replied
dead
man
of
course
that
always
happens
when
a
parishioner
dies
the
comes
to
sound
the
and
to
repeat
the
she
spoke
as
if
she
had
been
so
long
accustomed
to
the
thing
that
it
did
not
seem
to
her
worthwhile
mentioning

person
revery
illustration
it
has
been
said
that
men
fear
death
much
as
the
child
cries
at
entering
the
world
being
unable
to
know
what
loving
hands
are
waiting
to
receive
it
certainly
this
comparison
will
not
bear
scientific
examination
but
as
a
happy
fancy
it
is
beautiful
even
for
those
to
whom
it
can
make
no
religious
appeal
whatever
those
who
must
believe
that
the
individual
mind
dissolves
with
the
body
and
that
an
eternal
continuance
of
personality
could
only
prove
an
eternal
misfortune
it
is
beautiful
i
think
because
it
suggests
in
so
intimate
a
way
the
hope
that
to
larger
knowledge
the
absolute
will
reveal
itself
as
made
infinite
the
imagining
is
oriental
rather
than
occidental
yet
it
accords
with
a
sentiment
vaguely
defined
in
most
of
our
western
creeds
through
ancient
grim
conceptions
of
the
absolute
as
father
there
has
gradually
been
infused
some
later
and
brighter
dream
of
infinite
tenderness
some
hope
created
by
the
memory
of
woman
as
mother
and
the
more
that
races
evolve
toward
higher
things
the
more
feminine
becomes
their
idea
of
a
god
conversely
this
suggestion
must
remind
even
the
least
believing
that
we
know
of
nothing
else
in
all
the
range
of
human
experience
so
sacred
as
nothing
so
well
deserving
the
name
of
divine
alone
could
have
enabled
the
delicate
life
of
thought
to
unfold
and
to
endure
upon
the
rind
of
this
wretched
little
planet
only
through
that
supreme
unselfishness
could
the
nobler
emotions
ever
have
found
strength
to
blossom
in
the
brain
of
man
only
by
help
of
could
the
higher
forms
of
trust
in
the
unseen
ever
have
been
called
into
existence
but
musings
of
this
kind
naturally
lead
us
to
ask
ourselves
emotional
questions
about
the
mysteries
of
whither
and
whence
must
the
evolutionist
think
of
as
a
merely
necessary
result
of
material
affinities
the
attraction
of
the
atom
for
the
atom
or
can
he
venture
to
assert
with
ancient
thinkers
of
the
east
that
all
atomic
tendencies
are
shapen
by
one
eternal
moral
law
and
that
some
are
in
themselves
divine
being
manifestations
of
the
four
infinite
feelings
what
wisdom
can
decide
for
us
and
of
what
avail
to
know
our
highest
emotions
divine
since
the
race
itself
is
doomed
to
perish
when
shall
have
wrought
its
uttermost
for
humanity
will
not
even
that
uttermost
have
been
in
vain
at
first
thought
indeed
the
inevitable
dissolution
must
appear
the
blackest
of
imaginable
tragedies
tragedy
made
infinite
eventually
our
planet
must
die
its
azure
ghost
of
air
will
shrink
and
pass
its
seas
dry
up
its
very
soil
perish
utterly
leaving
only
a
universal
waste
of
sand
and
stone
the
withered
corpse
of
a
world
still
for
a
time
this
mummy
will
turn
about
the
sun
but
only
as
the
dead
moon
wheels
now
across
our
nights
one
face
forever
in
scorching
blaze
the
other
in
icy
darkness
so
will
it
circle
blank
and
bald
as
a
skull
and
like
a
skull
will
it
bleach
and
crack
and
crumble
ever
drawing
nearer
and
yet
more
near
to
the
face
of
its
flaming
parent
to
vanish
suddenly
at
last
in
the
cyclonic
lightning
of
his
breath
one
by
one
the
remaining
planets
must
follow
then
will
the
mighty
star
himself
begin
to
fail
to
flicker
with
ghastly
changing
colours
to
crimson
toward
his
death
and
finally
the
monstrous
fissured
cinder
of
him
hurled
into
some
colossal
will
be
dissipated
into
vapour
more
tenuous
than
the
dream
of
the
dream
of
a
ghost
what
then
will
have
availed
the
labour
of
the
life
that
was
the
life
effaced
without
one
sign
to
mark
the
place
of
its
disparition
in
the
illimitable
abyss
what
then
the
worth
of
the
whole
dead
world
of
human
tenderness
with
its
sacrifices
hopes
memories
its
divine
delights
and
diviner
pains
its
smiles
and
tears
and
sacred
caresses
its
countless
passionate
prayers
to
countless
vanished
gods
such
doubts
and
fears
do
not
trouble
the
thinker
of
the
east
us
they
disturb
chiefly
because
of
old
wrong
habits
of
thought
and
the
consequent
blind
fear
of
knowing
that
what
we
have
so
long
called
soul
belongs
not
to
essence
but
to
form
forms
appear
and
vanish
in
perpetual
succession
but
the
essence
alone
is
real
nothing
real
can
be
lost
even
in
the
dissipation
of
a
million
universes
utter
destruction
everlasting
death
all
such
terms
of
fear
have
no
correspondence
to
any
truth
but
the
eternal
law
of
change
even
forms
can
perish
only
as
waves
pass
and
break
they
melt
but
to
swell
anew
nothing
can
be
lost
in
the
nebulous
haze
of
our
dissolution
will
survive
the
essence
of
all
that
has
ever
been
in
human
life
the
units
of
every
existence
that
was
or
is
with
all
their
affinities
all
their
tendencies
all
their
inheritance
of
forces
making
for
good
or
evil
all
the
powers
amassed
through
myriad
generations
all
energies
that
ever
shaped
the
strength
of
races
and
times
innumerable
will
these
again
be
orbed
into
life
and
thought
transmutations
there
may
be
changes
also
made
by
augmentation
or
diminution
of
affinities
by
subtraction
or
addition
of
tendencies
for
the
dust
of
us
will
then
have
been
mingled
with
the
dust
of
other
countless
worlds
and
of
their
peoples
but
nothing
essential
can
be
lost
we
shall
inevitably
bequeath
our
part
to
the
making
of
the
future
cosmos
to
the
substance
out
of
which
another
intelligence
will
slowly
be
evolved
even
as
we
must
have
inherited
something
of
our
psychic
being
out
of
numberless
worlds
dissolved
so
will
future
humanities
inherit
not
from
us
alone
but
from
millions
of
planets
still
existing
for
the
vanishing
of
our
world
can
represent
in
the
disparition
of
a
universe
but
one
infinitesimal
detail
of
the
quenching
of
thought
the
peopled
spheres
that
must
share
our
doom
will
exceed
for
multitude
the
visible
lights
of
heaven
yet
those
countless
solar
fires
with
their
viewless
millions
of
living
planets
must
somehow
reappear
again
the
wondrous
cosmos
must
resume
its
sidereal
whirl
over
the
deeps
of
the
eternities
and
the
love
forever
with
rise
again
infinitudes
of
the
everlasting
battle
the
light
of
the
mother
smile
will
survive
our
sun
the
thrill
of
her
kiss
will
last
beyond
the
thrilling
of
stars
the
sweetness
of
her
lullaby
will
endure
in
the
of
worlds
yet
unevolved
the
tenderness
of
her
faith
will
quicken
the
fervour
of
prayers
to
be
made
to
the
hosts
of
another
heaven
to
the
gods
of
a
time
beyond
time
and
the
nectar
of
her
breasts
can
never
fail
that
snowy
stream
will
still
flow
on
to
nourish
the
life
of
some
humanity
more
perfect
than
our
own
when
the
milky
way
that
spans
our
night
shall
have
vanished
forever
out
of

pathological
illustration
very
much
do
i
love
cats
and
i
suppose
that
i
could
write
a
large
book
about
the
different
cats
which
i
have
kept
in
various
climes
and
times
on
both
sides
of
the
world
but
this
is
not
a
book
of
cats
and
i
am
writing
about
tama
for
merely
psychological
reasons
she
has
been
uttering
in
her
sleep
beside
my
chair
a
peculiar
cry
that
touched
me
in
a
particular
way
it
is
the
cry
that
a
cat
makes
only
for
her
kittens
a
soft
trilling
coo
a
pure
caress
of
tone
and
i
perceive
that
her
attitude
as
she
lies
there
on
her
side
is
the
attitude
of
a
cat
holding
something
something
freshly
caught
the
forepaws
are
stretched
out
as
to
grasp
and
the
pearly
talons
are
playing
we
call
her
tama
jewel
not
because
of
her
beauty
though
she
is
beautiful
but
because
tama
is
a
female
name
accorded
by
custom
to
pet
cats
she
was
a
very
small
kitten
when
she
was
first
brought
to
me
as
a
gift
worth
accepting
a
being
somewhat
uncommon
in
japan
in
certain
parts
of
the
country
such
a
cat
is
believed
to
be
a
and
gifted
with
power
to
frighten
away
goblins
as
well
as
rats
tama
is
now
two
years
old
i
think
that
she
has
foreign
blood
in
her
veins
she
is
more
graceful
and
more
slender
than
the
ordinary
japanese
cat
and
she
has
a
remarkably
long
tail
which
from
a
japanese
point
of
view
is
her
only
defect
perhaps
one
of
her
ancestors
came
to
japan
in
some
dutch
or
spanish
ship
during
the
time
of
iyéyasu
but
from
whatever
ancestors
descended
tama
is
quite
a
japanese
cat
in
her
habits
for
example
she
eats
rice
the
first
time
that
she
had
kittens
she
proved
herself
an
excellent
mother
devoting
all
her
strength
and
intelligence
to
the
care
of
her
little
ones
until
by
dint
of
nursing
them
and
moiling
for
them
she
became
piteously
and
ludicrously
thin
she
taught
them
how
to
keep
clean
how
to
play
and
jump
and
wrestle
how
to
hunt
at
first
of
course
she
gave
them
only
her
long
tail
to
play
with
but
later
she
found
them
other
toys
she
brought
them
not
only
rats
and
mice
but
also
frogs
lizards
a
bat
and
one
day
a
small
lamprey
which
she
must
have
managed
to
catch
in
a
neighbouring
after
dark
i
used
to
leave
open
for
her
a
small
window
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
leading
to
my
study
in
order
that
she
might
go
out
to
hunt
by
way
of
the
kitchen
roof
and
one
night
she
brought
in
through
that
window
a
big
straw
sandal
for
her
kittens
to
play
with
she
found
it
in
the
field
and
she
must
have
carried
it
over
a
wooden
fence
ten
feet
high
up
the
house
wall
to
the
roof
of
the
kitchen
and
thence
through
the
bars
of
the
little
window
to
the
stairway
there
she
and
her
kittens
played
boisterously
with
it
till
morning
and
they
dirtied
the
stairway
for
that
sandal
was
muddy
never
was
cat
more
fortunate
in
her
first
maternal
experience
than
tama
but
the
next
time
she
was
not
fortunate
she
had
got
into
the
habit
of
visiting
friends
in
another
street
at
a
perilous
distance
and
one
evening
while
on
her
way
thither
she
was
hurt
by
some
brutal
person
she
came
back
to
us
stupid
and
sick
and
her
kittens
were
born
dead
i
thought
that
she
would
die
also
but
she
recovered
much
more
quickly
than
anybody
could
have
imagined
possible
though
she
still
remains
for
obvious
reasons
troubled
in
spirit
by
the
loss
of
the
kittens
the
memory
of
animals
in
regard
to
certain
forms
of
relative
experience
is
strangely
weak
and
dim
but
the
organic
memory
of
the
animal
the
memory
of
experience
accumulated
through
countless
billions
of
lives
is
superhumanly
vivid
and
very
seldom
at
fault
think
of
the
astonishing
skill
with
which
a
cat
can
restore
the
respiration
of
her
drowned
kitten
think
of
her
untaught
ability
to
face
a
dangerous
enemy
seen
for
the
first
time
a
venomous
serpent
for
example
think
of
her
wide
acquaintance
with
small
creatures
and
their
ways
her
medical
knowledge
of
herbs
her
capacities
of
strategy
whether
for
hunting
or
fighting
what
she
knows
is
really
considerable
and
she
knows
it
all
perfectly
or
almost
perfectly
but
it
is
the
knowledge
of
other
existences
her
memory
as
to
the
pains
of
the
present
life
is
mercifully
brief
tama
could
not
clearly
remember
that
her
kittens
were
dead
she
knew
that
she
ought
to
have
had
kittens
and
she
looked
everywhere
and
called
everywhere
for
them
long
after
they
had
been
buried
in
the
garden
she
complained
a
great
deal
to
her
friends
and
she
made
me
open
all
the
cupboards
and
closets
over
and
over
again
to
prove
to
her
that
the
kittens
were
not
in
the
house
at
last
she
was
able
to
convince
herself
that
it
was
useless
to
look
for
them
any
more
but
she
plays
with
them
in
dreams
and
coos
to
them
and
catches
for
them
small
shadowy
things
perhaps
even
brings
to
them
through
some
dim
window
of
memory
a
sandal
of
ghostly
straw
in
the
dead
of
the
night
illustration
black
chill
and
still
so
black
so
still
that
i
touch
myself
to
find
out
whether
i
have
yet
a
body
then
i
grope
about
me
to
make
sure
that

am

even
so

must
i

which
is
horror
but
must
i
believe
that
i
really
exist
in
the
moment
of
that
the
darkness
stood
about
me
as
a
wall
and
spake
i
am
only
the
shadow
i
shall
pass
but
the
reality
will
come
and
will
not
pass
i
am
only
the
shadow
in
me
there
are
lights
the
glimmering
of
a
hundred
millions
of
suns
and
in
me
there
are
voices
with
the
coming
of
the
reality
there
will
be
no
more
lights
nor
any
voice
nor
any
rising
nor
any
hope
but
far
above
you
there
will
still
be
sun
for
many
a
million
years
and
warmth
and
youth
and
love
and
vast
azure
of
sky
and
sea
fragrance
of
summer
bloom
shrillings
in
grass
and
grove
flutter
of
shadows
and
flicker
of
light
laughter
of
waters
and
laughter
of
girls
blackness
and
silence
for
you
and
cold
blind
creepings
i
made
reply
of
thoughts
like
these
i
am
now
afraid
but
that
is
only
because
i
have
been
startled
out
of
sleep
when
all
my
brain
awakens
i
shall
not
be
afraid
for
this
fear
is
brute
fear
only
the
deep
and
dim
primordial
fear
bequeathed
me
from
the
million
ages
of
the
life
of
instinct
already
it
is
passing
i
can
begin
to
think
of
death
as
dreamless
rest
a
sleep
with
no
sensation
of
either
joy
or
pain
the
darkness
whispered
what
is
sensation
and
i
could
not
answer
and
the
gloom
took
weight
and
pressed
upon
me
and
said
you
do
not
know
what
is
sensation
how
then
can
you
say
whether
there
will
or
will
not
be
pain
for
the
dust
of
you
the
molecules
of
your
body
the
atoms
of
your
soul
atoms
what
are
they
again
i
could
make
no
answer
and
the
weight
of
the
gloom
waxed
greater
a
weight
of
pyramids
and
the
whisper
hissed
their
repulsions
their
attractions
the
awful
clingings
of
them
and
the
leapings
what
are
these
passions
of
lives
burnt
out
furies
of
insatiable
desire
frenzies
of
everlasting
hate
madnesses
of
never
ending
torment
you
do
not
know
but
you
say
that
there
will
be
no
more
pain
then
i
cried
out
to
the
mocker
i
am
awake
awake
fully
awake
i
have
ceased
to
fear
i
remember
all
that
i
am
is
all
that
i
have
been
before
the
beginnings
of
time
i
was
beyond
the
uttermost
circling
of
the
eternities
i
shall
endure
in
myriad
million
forms
i
but
seem
to
pass
as
form
i
am
only
wave
as
essence
i
am
sea
sea
without
shore
i
am
and
doubt
and
fear
and
pain
are
but
duskings
that
fleet
on
the
face
of
my
asleep
i
behold
the
illusions
of
time
but
waking
i
know
myself
timeless
one
with
the
life
that
has
neither
form
yet
also
one
begins
and
the
grave
and
graves
the
the
eater
of
neither
form
nor
name
yet
also
one
with
all
that
begins
and
ends
even
the
grave
and
the
maker
of
graves
the
corpse
and
the
eater
of
corpses
a
sparrow
twittered
from
the
roof
another
responded
shapes
of
things
began
to
define
in
a
soft
gray
glimmering
and
the
gloom
slowly
lightened
murmurs
of
the
city
wakening
came
to
my
ears
and
grew
and
multiplied
and
the
dimness
flushed
then
rose
the
beautiful
and
holy
sun
the
mighty
quickener
the
mighty
putrefier
symbol
sublime
of
that
infinite
life
whose
forces
are
also
mine
issun

illustration
his
cage
is
exactly
two
japanese
inches
high
and
one
inch
and
a
half
wide
its
tiny
wooden
door
turning
upon
a
pivot
will
scarcely
admit
the
tip
of
my
little
finger
but
he
has
plenty
of
room
in
that
cage
room
to
walk
and
jump
and
fly
for
he
is
so
small
that
you
must
look
very
carefully
through
the
sides
of
it
in
order
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
him
i
have
always
to
turn
the
cage
round
and
round
several
times
in
a
good
light
before
i
can
discover
his
whereabouts
and
then
i
usually
find
him
resting
in
one
of
the
upper
corners
clinging
upside
down
to
his
ceiling
of
gauze
imagine
a
cricket
about
the
size
of
an
ordinary
mosquito
with
a
pair
of
antennae
much
longer
than
his
own
body
and
so
fine
that
you
can
distinguish
them
only
against
the
light
or
is
the
japanese
name
of
him
and
he
is
worth
in
the
market
exactly
twelve
cents
that
is
to
say
very
much
more
than
his
weight
in
gold
twelve
cents
for
such
a
thing
by
day
he
sleeps
or
meditates
except
while
occupied
with
the
slice
of
fresh
or
cucumber
which
must
be
poked
into
his
cage
every
morning
to
keep
him
clean
and
well
fed
is
somewhat
troublesome
could
you
see
him
you
would
think
it
absurd
to
take
any
pains
for
the
sake
of
a
creature
so
ridiculously
small
but
always
at
sunset
the
infinitesimal
soul
of
him
awakens
then
the
room
begins
to
fill
with
a
delicate
and
ghostly
music
of
indescribable
sweetness
thin
thin
silvery
rippling
and
trilling
as
of
tiniest
electric
bells
as
the
darkness
deepens
the
sound
becomes
sweeter
sometimes
swelling
till
the
whole
house
seems
to
vibrate
with
the
elfish
resonance
sometimes
thinning
down
into
the
faintest
imaginable
thread
of
a
voice
but
loud
or
low
it
keeps
a
penetrating
quality
that
is
weird
all
night
the
atomy
thus
sings
he
ceases
only
when
the
temple
bell
proclaims
the
hour
of
dawn
now
this
tiny
song
is
a
song
of
love
vague
love
of
the
unseen
and
unknown
it
is
quite
impossible
that
he
should
ever
have
seen
or
known
in
this
present
existence
of
his
not
even
his
ancestors
for
many
generations
back
could
have
known
anything
of
the
of
the
fields
or
the
amorous
value
of
song
they
were
born
of
eggs
hatched
in
a
jar
of
clay
in
the
shop
of
some
and
they
dwelt
thereafter
only
in
cages
but
he
sings
the
song
of
his
race
as
it
was
sung
a
myriad
years
ago
and
as
faultlessly
as
if
he
understood
the
exact
significance
of
every
note
of
course
he
did
not
learn
the
song
it
is
a
song
of
organic
memory
deep
dim
memory
of
other
quintillions
of
lives
when
the
ghost
of
him
shrilled
at
night
from
the
dewy
grasses
of
the
hills
then
that
song
brought
him
love
and
death
he
has
forgotten
all
about
death
but
he
remembers
the
love
and
therefore
he
sings
now
for
the
bride
that
will
never
come
so
that
his
longing
is
unconsciously
retrospective
he
cries
to
the
dust
of
the
past
he
calls
to
the
silence
and
the
gods
for
the
return
of
time
human
lovers
do
very
much
the
same
thing
without
knowing
it
they
call
their
illusion
an
ideal
and
their
ideal
is
after
all
a
mere
shadowing
of
a
phantom
of
organic
memory
the
living
present
has
very
little
to
do
with
it
perhaps
this
atomy
also
has
an
ideal
or
at
least
the
rudiment
of
an
ideal
but
in
any
event
the
tiny
desire
must
utter
its
plaint
in
vain
the
fault
is
not
altogether
mine
i
had
been
warned
that
if
the
creature
were
mated
he
would
cease
to
sing
and
would
speedily
die
but
night
after
night
the
plaintive
sweet
unanswered
trilling
touched
me
like
a
reproach
became
at
last
an
obsession
an
affliction
a
torment
of
conscience
and
i
tried
to
buy
a
female
it
was
too
late
in
the
season
there
were
no
more
for
sale
either
males
or
females
the
laughed
and
said
he
ought
to
have
died
about
the
twentieth
day
of
the
ninth
month
it
was
already
the
second
day
of
the
tenth
month
but
the
did
not
know
that
i
have
a
good
stove
in
my
study
and
keep
the
temperature
at
above
wherefore
my
still
sings
at
the
close
of
the
eleventh
month
and
i
hope
to
keep
him
alive
until
the
period
of
greatest
cold
however
the
rest
of
his
generation
are
probably
dead
neither
for
love
nor
money
could
i
now
find
him
a
mate
and
were
i
to
set
him
free
in
order
that
he
might
make
the
search
for
himself
he
could
not
possibly
live
through
a
single
night
even
if
fortunate
enough
to
escape
by
day
the
multitude
of
his
natural
enemies
in
the
garden
ants
centipedes
and
ghastly
last
evening
the
of
the
eleventh
month
an
odd
feeling
came
to
me
as
i
sat
at
my
desk
a
sense
of
emptiness
in
the
room
then
i
became
aware
that
my
was
silent
contrary
to
his
wont
i
went
to
the
silent
cage
and
found
him
lying
dead
beside
a
lump
of
as
gray
and
hard
as
a
stone
evidently
he
had
not
been
fed
for
three
or
four
days
but
only
the
night
before
his
death
he
had
been
singing
wonderfully
so
that
i
foolishly
imagined
him
to
be
more
than
usually
contented
my
student
aki
who
loves
insects
used
to
feed
him
but
aki
had
gone
into
the
country
for
a
week
holiday
and
the
duty
of
caring
for
the
had
devolved
upon
hana
the
housemaid
she
is
not
sympathetic
hana
the
housemaid
she
says
that
she
did
not
forget
the
mite
but
there
was
no
more
and
she
had
never
thought
of
substituting
a
slice
of
onion
or
of
cucumber
i
spoke
words
of
reproof
to
hana
the
housemaid
and
she
dutifully
expressed
contrition
but
the
has
stopped
and
the
stillness
reproaches
and
the
room
is
cold
in
spite
of
the
stove
absurd
i
have
made
a
good
girl
unhappy
because
of
an
insect
half
the
size
of
a
the
quenching
of
that
infinitesimal
life
troubles
me
more
than
i
could
have
believed
possible
of
course
the
mere
habit
of
thinking
about
a
creature
wants
even
the
wants
of
a
cricket
may
create
by
insensible
degrees
an
imaginative
interest
an
attachment
of
which
one
becomes
conscious
only
when
the
relation
is
broken
besides
i
had
felt
so
much
in
the
hush
of
the
night
the
charm
of
the
delicate
voice
telling
of
one
minute
existence
dependent
upon
my
will
and
selfish
pleasure
as
upon
the
favour
of
a
god
telling
me
also
that
the
atom
of
ghost
in
the
tiny
cage
and
the
atom
of
ghost
within
myself
were
forever
but
one
and
the
same
in
the
deeps
of
the
vast
of
being
and
then
to
think
of
the
little
creature
hungering
and
thirsting
night
after
night
and
day
after
day
while
the
thoughts
of
his
guardian
deity
were
turned
to
the
weaving
of
dreams
how
bravely
nevertheless
he
sang
on
to
the
very
end
an
atrocious
end
for
he
had
eaten
his
own
legs
may
the
gods
forgive
us
all
especially
hana
the
housemaid
yet
after
all
to
devour
one
own
legs
for
hunger
is
not
the
worst
by
that
can
happen
to
a
being
cursed
with
the
gift
of
song
there
are
human
crickets
who
must
eat
their
own
hearts
in
order
to
sing
the

how
short

to
eat
our

old
japanese
the
name
of
the
creature
is
baku
or
shirokinakatsukami
and
its
particular
function
is
the
eating
of
dreams
it
is
variously
represented
and
described
an
ancient
book
in
my
possession
states
that
the
male
baku
has
the
body
of
a
horse
the
face
of
a
lion
the
trunk
and
tusks
of
an
elephant
the
forelock
of
a
rhinoceros
the
tail
of
a
cow
and
the
feet
of
a
tiger
the
female
baku
is
said
to
differ
greatly
in
shape
from
the
male
but
the
difference
is
not
clearly
set
forth
in
the
time
of
the
old
chinese
learning
pictures
of
the
baku
used
to
be
hung
up
in
japanese
houses
such
pictures
being
supposed
to
exert
the
same
beneficent
power
as
the
creature
itself
my
ancient
book
contains
this
legend
about
the
custom
in
the
it
is
declared
that
kōtei
while
hunting
on
the
eastern
coast
once
met
with
a
baku
having
the
body
of
an
animal
but
speaking
like
a
man
kōtei
said
the
world
is
quiet
and
at
peace
why
should
we
still
see
goblins
if
a
baku
be
needed
to
extinguish
evil
sprites
then
it
were
better
to
have
a
picture
of
the
baku
suspended
to
the
wall
of
one
house
thereafter
even
though
some
evil
wonder
should
appear
it
could
do
no
harm
then
there
is
given
a
long
list
of
evil
wonders
and
the
signs
of
their
presence
when
the
hen
lays
a
soft
egg
the
demon
name
is
taifu
when
snakes
appear
entwined
together
the
demon
name
is
jinzu
when
dogs
go
with
their
ears

the
demon
name
is
taiyō
when
the
fox
speaks
with
the
voice
of
a
man
the
demon
name
is
gwaishū
when
blood
appears
on
the
clothes
of
men
the

name
is

a
human
voice
the
demon
name
kanjo
the
dream
of
the
night
is
an
evil
dream
the
demon
name
ringetsu
and
the
old
book
further
observes
whenever
any
such
evil
marvel
happens
let
the
name
of
the
baku
be
invoked
then
the
evil
sprite
will
immediately
sink
three
feet
under
the
ground
but
on
the
subject
of
evil
wonders
i
do
not
feel
qualified
to
discourse
it
belongs
to
the
unexplored
and
appalling
world
of
chinese
demonology
and
it
has
really
very
little
to
do
with
the
subject
of
the
baku
in
japan
the
japanese
baku
is
commonly
known
only
as
the
eater
of
dreams
and
the
most
remarkable
fact
in
relation
to
the
cult
of
the
creature
is
that
the
chinese
character
representing
its
name
used
to
be
put
in
gold
upon
the
lacquered
wooden
pillows
of
lords
and
princes
by
the
virtue
and
power
of
this
character
on
the
pillow
the
sleeper
was
thought
to
be
protected
from
evil
dreams
it
is
rather
difficult
to
find
such
a
pillow
even
pictures
of
the
baku
or
hakutaku
as
it
is
sometimes
called
have
become
very
rare
but
the
old
invocation
to
the
baku
still
survives
in
common
parlance
baku
kuraë
baku
kuraë
devour
o
baku
devour
my
evil
dream
when
you
awake
from
a
nightmare
or
from
any
unlucky
dream
you
should
quickly
repeat
that
invocation
three
times
then
the
baku
will
eat
the
dream
and
will
change
the
misfortune
or
the
fear
into
good
fortune
and
gladness
it
was
on
a
very
sultry
night
during
the
period
of
greatest
heat
that
i
last
saw
the
baku
i
had
just
awakened
out
of
misery
and
the
hour
was
the
hour
of
the
ox
and
the
baku
came
in
through
the
window
to
ask
have
you
anything
for
me
to
eat
i
gratefully
made
answer
assuredly
listen
good
baku
to
this
dream
of
mine
i
was
standing
in
some
great
room
where
lamps
were
burning
but
i
cast
no
shadow
on
the
naked
floor
of
that
room
and
there
upon
an
iron
bed
i
saw
my
own
dead
body
how
i
had
come
to
die
and
when
i
had
died
i
could
not
remember
women
were
sitting
near
the
bed
six
or
seven
and
i
did
not
know
any
of
them
they
were
neither
young
nor
old
and
all
were
dressed
in
black
watchers
i
took
them
to
be
they
sat
motionless
and
silent
there
was
no
sound
in
the
place
and
i
somehow
felt
that
the
hour
was
late
in
the
same
moment
i
became
aware
of
something
nameless
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
room
heaviness
that
weighed
upon
the
will
some
viewless
numbing
power
that
was
slowly
growing
then
the
watchers
began
to
watch
each
other
stealthily
and
i
knew
that
they
were
afraid
soundlessly
one
rose
up
and
left
the
room
another
followed
then
another
so
one
by
one
and
lightly
as
shadows
they
all
went
out
i
was
left
alone
with
the
corpse
of
myself
the
lamps
still
burned
clearly
but
the
terror
in
the
air
was
thickening
the
watchers
had
stolen
away
almost
as
soon
as
they
began
to
feel
it
but
i
believed
that
there
was
yet
time
to
escape
i
thought
that
i
could
safely
delay
a
moment
longer
a
monstrous
curiosity
obliged
me
to
remain
i
wanted
to
look
at
my
own
body
to
examine
it
closely
i
approached
it
i
observed
it
and
i
wondered
because
it
seemed
to
me
very
long
unnaturally
long
then
i
thought
that
i
saw
one
eyelid
quiver
but
the
appearance
of
motion
might
have
been
caused
by
the
trembling
of
a
i
stooped
to
look
slowly
and
very
cautiously
because
i
was
afraid
that
the
eyes
might
open
is
myself
i
thought
as
i
bent
down
yet
it
is
growing
queer
the
face
appeared
to
be
lengthening
is
not
myself
i
thought
again
as
i
stooped
still
lower
yet
it
can
not
be
any
other
and
i
became
much
more
afraid
unspeakably
afraid
that
the
eyes
would
open
opened
horribly
they
opened
and
that
thing
sprang
sprang
from
the
bed
at
me
and
fastened
upon
me
moaning
and
gnawing
and
rending
oh
with
what
madness
of
terror
did
i
strive
against
it
but
the
eyes
of
it
and
the
moans
of
it
and
the
touch
of
it
sickened
and
all
my
being
seemed
about
to
burst
asunder
in
frenzy
of
loathing
when
i
knew
not
how
i
found
in
my
hand
an
axe
and
i
struck
with
the
axe
i
clove
i
crushed
i
brayed
the
moaner
until
there
lay
before
me
only
a
shapeless
hideous
reeking
mass
the
abominable
ruin
of
myself
kuraë
baku
kuraë
baku
kuraë
devour
o
baku
devour
the
dream
nay
made
answer
the
baku
i
never
eat
lucky
dreams
that
is
a
very
lucky
dream
a
most
fortunate
dream
the
axe
yes
the
axe
of
the
excellent
law
by
which
the
monster
of
self
is
utterly
destroyed
the
best
kind
of
a
dream
my
friend
believe
in
the
teaching
of
the
buddha
and
the
baku
went
out
of
the
window
i
looked
after
him
and
i
beheld
him
fleeing
over
the
miles
of
moonlit
roofs
passing
from
to
with
amazing
soundless
leaps
like
a
great
cat
