catch
the
stealer
of

before
a

dark
and
deep
where
wolves
retired
by
day
to
sleep
which
he
suspected
as
the
thieves
he
set
his
trap
among
the
leaves
and
ere
he
left
the
place
he
thus
invoked
celestial
grace
o
king
of
all
the
powers
divine
against
the
rogue

grant
me
this
delight
that
this
my

may
catch
him

from

make

thine

the
words
were

forth
came
