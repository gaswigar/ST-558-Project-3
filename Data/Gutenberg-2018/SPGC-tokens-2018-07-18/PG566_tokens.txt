preface
the
present
is
the
only
collected
edition
of
the
principal
works
of
schiller
which
is
accessible
to
english
readers
detached
poems
or
dramas
have
been
translated
at
various
times
and
sometimes
by
men
of
eminence
since
the
first
publication
of
the
original
works
and
in
several
instances
these
versions
have
been
incorporated
after
some
revision
or
necessary
correction
into
the
following
collection
but
on
the
other
hand
a
large
proportion
of
the
contents
have
been
specially
translated
for
this
edition
in
which
category
are
the
historical
works
which
occupy
this
volume
and
a
portion
of
the
next
schiller
was
not
less
efficiently
qualified
by
nature
for
an
historian
than
for
a
dramatist
he
was
formed
to
excel
in
all
departments
of
literature
and
the
admirable
lucidity
of
style
and
soundness
and
impartiality
of
judgment
displayed
in
his
historical
writings
will
not
easily
by
surpassed
and
will
always
recommend
them
as
popular
expositions
of
the
periods
of
which
they
treat
since
the
first
publication
of
this

many
corrections
and

have

book
i
from
the
beginning
of
the
religious
wars
in
germany
to
the
peace
of
munster
scarcely
any
thing
great
or
remarkable
occurred
in
the
political
world
of
europe
in
which
the
reformation
had
not
an
important
share
all
the
events
of
this
period
if
they
did
not
originate
in
soon
became
mixed
up
with
the
question
of
religion
and
no
state
was
either
too
great
or
too
little
to
feel
directly
or
indirectly
more
or
less
of
its
influence
against
the
reformed
doctrine
and
its
adherents
the
house
of
austria
directed
almost
exclusively
the
whole
of
its
immense
political
power
in
france
the
reformation
had
enkindled
a
civil
war
which
under
four
stormy
reigns
shook
the
kingdom
to
its
foundations
brought
foreign
armies
into
the
heart
of
the
country
and
for
half
a
century
rendered
it
the
scene
of
the
most
mournful
disorders
it
was
the
reformation
too
that
rendered
the
spanish
yoke
intolerable
to
the
flemings
and
awakened
in
them
both
the
desire
and
the
courage
to
throw
off
its
fetters
while
it
also
principally
furnished
them
with
the
means
of
their
emancipation
and
as
to
england
all
the
evils
with
which
philip
the
second
threatened
elizabeth
were
mainly
intended
in
revenge
for
her
having
taken
his
protestant
subjects
under
her
protection
and
placing
herself
at
the
head
of
a
religious
party
which
it
was
his
aim
and
endeavour
to
extirpate
in
germany
the
schisms
in
the
church
produced
also
a
lasting
political
schism
which
made
that
country
for
more
than
a
century
the
theatre
of
confusion
but
at
the
same
time
threw
up
a
firm
barrier
against
political
oppression
it
was
too
the
reformation
principally
that
first
drew
the
northern
powers
denmark
and
sweden
into
the
political
system
of
europe
and
while
on
the
one
hand
the
protestant
league
was
strengthened
by
their
adhesion
it
on
the
other
was
indispensable
to
their
interests
states
which
hitherto
scarcely
concerned
themselves
with
one
another
existence
acquired
through
the
reformation
an
attractive
centre
of
interest
and
began
to
be
united
by
new
political
sympathies
and
as
through
its
influence
new
relations
sprang
up
between
citizen
and
citizen
and
between
rulers
and
subjects
so
also
entire
states
were
forced
by
it
into
new
relative
positions
thus
by
a
strange
course
of
events
religious
disputes
were
the
means
of
cementing
a
closer
union
among
the
nations
of
europe
fearful
indeed
and
destructive
was
the
first
movement
in
which
this
general
political
sympathy
announced
itself
a
desolating
war
of
thirty
years
which
from
the
interior
of
bohemia
to
the
mouth
of
the
scheldt
and
from
the
banks
of
the
po
to
the
coasts
of
the
baltic
devastated
whole
countries
destroyed
harvests
and
reduced
towns
and
villages
to
ashes
which
opened
a
grave
for
many
thousand
combatants
and
for
half
a
century
smothered
the
glimmering
sparks
of
civilization
in
germany
and
threw
back
the
improving
manners
of
the
country
into
their
pristine
barbarity
and
wildness
yet
out
of
this
fearful
war
europe
came
forth
free
and
independent
in
it
she
first
learned
to
recognize
herself
as
a
community
of
nations
and
this
intercommunion
of
states
which
originated
in
the
thirty
years
war
may
alone
be
sufficient
to
reconcile
the
philosopher
to
its
horrors
the
hand
of
industry
has
slowly
but
gradually
effaced
the
traces
of
its
ravages
while
its
beneficent
influence
still
survives
and
this
general
sympathy
among
the
states
of
europe
which
grew
out
of
the
troubles
in
bohemia
is
our
guarantee
for
the
continuance
of
that
peace
which
was
the
result
of
the
war
as
the
sparks
of
destruction
found
their
way
from
the
interior
of
bohemia
moravia
and
austria
to
kindle
germany
france
and
the
half
of
europe
so
also
will
the
torch
of
civilization
make
a
path
for
itself
from
the
latter
to
enlighten
the
former
countries
all
this
was
effected
by
religion
religion
alone
could
have
rendered
possible
all
that
was
accomplished
but
it
was
far
from
being
the
sole
motive
of
the
war
had
not
private
advantages
and
state
interests
been
closely
connected
with
it
vain
and
powerless
would
have
been
the
arguments
of
theologians
and
the
cry
of
the
people
would
never
have
met
with
princes
so
willing
to
espouse
their
cause
nor
the
new
doctrines
have
found
such
numerous
brave
and
persevering
champions
the
reformation
is
undoubtedly
owing
in
a
great
measure
to
the
invincible
power
of
truth
or
of
opinions
which
were
held
as
such
the
abuses
in
the
old
church
the
absurdity
of
many
of
its
dogmas
the
extravagance
of
its
requisitions
necessarily
revolted
the
tempers
of
men
already
with
the
promise
of
a
better
light
and
favourably
disposed
them
towards
the
new
doctrines
the
charm
of
independence
the
rich
plunder
of
monastic
institutions
made
the
reformation
attractive
in
the
eyes
of
princes
and
tended
not
a
little
to
strengthen
their
inward
convictions
nothing
however
but
political
considerations
could
have
driven
them
to
espouse
it
had
not
charles
the
fifth
in
the
intoxication
of
success
made
an
attempt
on
the
independence
of
the
german
states
a
protestant
league
would
scarcely
have
rushed
to
arms
in
defence
of
freedom
of
belief
but
for
the
ambition
of
the
guises
the
calvinists
in
france
would
never
have
beheld
a
conde
or
a
coligny
at
their
head
without
the
exaction
of
the
tenth
and
the
twentieth
penny
the
see
of
rome
had
never
lost
the
united
netherlands
princes
fought
in
or
for
aggrandizement
while
religious
enthusiasm
recruited
their
armies
and
opened
to
them
the
treasures
of
their
subjects
of
the
multitude
who
flocked
to
their
standards
such
as
were
not
lured
by
the
hope
of
plunder
imagined
they
were
fighting
for
the
truth
while
in
fact
they
were
shedding
their
blood
for
the
personal
objects
of
their
princes
and
well
was
it
for
the
people
that
on
this
occasion
their
interests
coincided
with
those
of
their
princes
to
this
coincidence
alone
were
they
indebted
for
their
deliverance
from
popery
well
was
it
also
for
the
rulers
that
the
subject
contended
too
for
his
own
cause
while
he
was
fighting
their
battles
fortunately
at
this
date
no
european
sovereign
was
so
absolute
as
to
be
able
in
the
pursuit
of
his
political
designs
to
dispense
with
the
goodwill
of
his
subjects
yet
how
difficult
was
it
to
gain
and
to
set
to
work
this
goodwill
the
most
impressive
arguments
drawn
from
reasons
of
state
fall
powerless
on
the
ear
of
the
subject
who
seldom
understands
and
still
more
rarely
is
interested
in
them
in
such
circumstances
the
only
course
open
to
a
prudent
prince
is
to
connect
the
interests
of
the
cabinet
with
some
one
that
sits
nearer
to
the
people
heart
if
such
exists
or
if
not
to
create
it
in
such
a
position
stood
the
greater
part
of
those
princes
who
embraced
the
cause
of
the
reformation
by
a
strange
concatenation
of
events
the
divisions
of
the
church
were
associated
with
two
circumstances
without
which
in
all
probability
they
would
have
had
a
very
different
conclusion
these
were
the
increasing
power
of
the
house
of
austria
which
threatened
the
liberties
of
europe
and
its
active
zeal
for
the
old
religion
the
first
aroused
the
princes
while
the
second
armed
the
people
the
abolition
of
a
foreign
jurisdiction
within
their
own
territories
the
supremacy
in
ecclesiastical
matters
the
stopping
of
the
treasure
which
had
so
long
flowed
to
rome
the
rich
plunder
of
religious
foundations
were
tempting
advantages
to
every
sovereign
why
then
it
may
be
asked
did
they
not
operate
with
equal
force
upon
the
princes
of
the
house
of
austria
what
prevented
this
house
particularly
in
its
german
branch
from
yielding
to
the
pressing
demands
of
so
many
of
its
subjects
and
after
the
example
of
other
princes
enriching
itself
at
the
expense
of
a
defenceless
clergy
it
is
difficult
to
credit
that
a
belief
in
the
infallibility
of
the
romish
church
had
any
greater
influence
on
the
pious
adherence
of
this
house
than
the
opposite
conviction
had
on
the
revolt
of
the
protestant
princes
in
fact
several
circumstances
combined
to
make
the
austrian
princes
zealous
supporters
of
popery
spain
and
italy
from
which
austria
derived
its
principal
strength
were
still
devoted
to
the
see
of
rome
with
that
blind
obedience
which
ever
since
the
days
of
the
gothic
dynasty
had
been
the
peculiar
characteristic
of
the
spaniard
the
slightest
approximation
in
a
spanish
prince
to
the
obnoxious
tenets
of
luther
and
calvin
would
have
alienated
for
ever
the
affections
of
his
subjects
and
a
defection
from
the
pope
would
have
cost
him
the
kingdom
a
spanish
prince
had
no
alternative
but
orthodoxy
or
abdication
the
same
restraint
was
imposed
upon
austria
by
her
italian
dominions
which
she
was
obliged
to
treat
if
possible
with
even
greater
indulgence
impatient
as
they
naturally
were
of
a
foreign
yoke
and
possessing
also
ready
means
of
shaking
it
off
in
regard
to
the
latter
provinces
moreover
the
rival
pretensions
of
france
and
the
neighbourhood
of
the
pope
were
motives
sufficient
to
prevent
the
emperor
from
declaring
in
favour
of
a
party
which
strove
to
annihilate
the
papal
see
and
also
to
induce
him
to
show
the
most
active
zeal
in
behalf
of
the
old
religion
these
general
considerations
which
must
have
been
equally
weighty
with
every
spanish
monarch
were
in
the
particular
case
of
charles
still
further
enforced
by
peculiar
and
personal
motives
in
italy
this
monarch
had
a
formidable
rival
in
the
king
of
france
under
whose
protection
that
country
might
throw
itself
the
instant
that
charles
should
incur
the
slightest
suspicion
of
heresy
distrust
on
the
part
of
the
roman
catholics
and
a
rupture
with
the
church
would
have
been
fatal
also
to
many
of
his
most
cherished
designs
moreover
when
charles
was
first
called
upon
to
make
his
election
between
the
two
parties
the
new
doctrine
had
not
yet
attained
to
a
full
and
commanding
influence
and
there
still
subsisted
a
prospect
of
its
reconciliation
with
the
old
in
his
son
and
successor
philip
the
second
a
monastic
education
combined
with
a
gloomy
and
despotic
disposition
to
generate
an
unmitigated
hostility
to
all
innovations
in
religion
a
feeling
which
the
thought
that
his
most
formidable
political
opponents
were
also
the
enemies
of
his
faith
was
not
calculated
to
weaken
as
his
european
possessions
scattered
as
they
were
over
so
many
countries
were
on
all
sides
exposed
to
the
seductions
of
foreign
opinions
the
progress
of
the
reformation
in
other
quarters
could
not
well
be
a
matter
of
indifference
to
him
his
immediate
interests
therefore
urged
him
to
attach
himself
devotedly
to
the
old
church
in
order
to
close
up
the
sources
of
the
heretical
contagion
thus
circumstances
naturally
placed
this
prince
at
the
head
of
the
league
which
the
roman
catholics
formed
against
the
reformers
the
principles
which
had
actuated
the
long
and
active
reigns
of
charles
and
philip
the
second
remained
a
law
for
their
successors
and
the
more
the
breach
in
the
church
widened
the
firmer
became
the
attachment
of
the
spaniards
to
roman
catholicism
the
german
line
of
the
house
of
austria
was
apparently
more
unfettered
but
in
reality
though
free
from
many
of
these
restraints
it
was
yet
confined
by
others
the
possession
of
the
imperial
throne
a
dignity
it
was
impossible
for
a
protestant
to
hold
for
with
what
consistency
could
an
apostate
from
the
romish
church
wear
the
crown
of
a
roman
emperor
bound
the
successors
of
ferdinand
to
the
see
of
rome
ferdinand
himself
was
from
conscientious
motives
heartily
attached
to
it
besides
the
german
princes
of
the
house
of
austria
were
not
powerful
enough
to
dispense
with
the
support
of
spain
which
however
they
would
have
forfeited
by
the
least
show
of
leaning
towards
the
new
doctrines
the
imperial
dignity
also
required
them
to
preserve
the
existing
political
system
of
germany
with
which
the
maintenance
of
their
own
authority
was
closely
bound
up
but
which
it
was
the
aim
of
the
protestant
league
to
destroy
if
to
these
grounds
we
add
the
indifference
of
the
protestants
to
the
emperor
necessities
and
to
the
common
dangers
of
the
empire
their
encroachments
on
the
temporalities
of
the
church
and
their
aggressive
violence
when
they
became
conscious
of
their
own
power
we
can
easily
conceive
how
so
many
concurring
motives
must
have
determined
the
emperors
to
the
side
of
popery
and
how
their
own
interests
came
to
be
intimately
interwoven
with
those
of
the
roman
church
as
its
fate
seemed
to
depend
altogether
on
the
part
taken
by
austria
the
princes
of
this
house
came
to
be
regarded
by
all
europe
as
the
pillars
of
popery
the
hatred
therefore
which
the
protestants
bore
against
the
latter
was
turned
exclusively
upon
austria
and
the
cause
became
gradually
confounded
with
its
protector
but
this
irreconcileable
enemy
of
the
reformation
the
house
of
austria
by
its
ambitious
projects
and
the
overwhelming
force
which
it
could
bring
to
their
support
endangered
in
no
small
degree
the
freedom
of
europe
and
more
especially
of
the
german
states
this
circumstance
could
not
fail
to
rouse
the
latter
from
their
security
and
to
render
them
vigilant
in
their
ordinary
resources
were
quite
insufficient
to
resist
so
formidable
a
power
extraordinary
exertions
were
required
from
their
subjects
and
when
even
these
proved
far
from
adequate
they
had
recourse
to
foreign
assistance
and
by
means
of
a
common
league
they
endeavoured
to
oppose
a
power
which
singly
they
were
unable
to
withstand
but
the
strong
political
inducements
which
the
german
princes
had
to
resist
the
pretensions
of
the
house
of
austria
naturally
did
not
extend
to
their
subjects
it
is
only
immediate
advantages
or
immediate
evils
that
set
the
people
in
action
and
for
these
a
sound
policy
can
not
wait
ill
then
would
it
have
fared
with
these
princes
if
by
good
fortune
another
effectual
motive
had
not
offered
itself
which
roused
the
passions
of
the
people
and
kindled
in
them
an
enthusiasm
which
might
be
directed
against
the
political
danger
as
having
with
it
a
common
cause
of
alarm
this
motive
was
their
avowed
hatred
of
the
religion
which
austria
protected
and
their
enthusiastic
attachment
to
a
doctrine
which
that
house
was
endeavouring
to
extirpate
by
fire
and
sword
their
attachment
was
ardent
their
hatred
invincible
religious
fanaticism
anticipates
even
the
remotest
dangers
enthusiasm
never
calculates
its
sacrifices
what
the
most
pressing
danger
of
the
state
could
not
gain
from
the
citizens
was
effected
by
religious
zeal
for
the
state
or
for
the
prince
few
would
have
drawn
the
sword
but
for
religion
the
merchant
the
artist
the
peasant
all
cheerfully
flew
to
arms
for
the
state
or
for
the
prince
even
the
smallest
additional
impost
would
have
been
avoided
but
for
religion
the
people
readily
staked
at
once
life
fortune
and
all
earthly
hopes
it
trebled
the
contributions
which
flowed
into
the
exchequer
of
the
princes
and
the
armies
which
marched
to
the
field
and
in
the
ardent
excitement
produced
in
all
minds
by
the
peril
to
which
their
faith
was
exposed
the
subject
felt
not
the
pressure
of
those
burdens
and
privations
under
which
in
cooler
moments
he
would
have
sunk
exhausted
the
terrors
of
the
spanish
inquisition
and
the
massacre
of
bartholomew
procured
for
the
prince
of
orange
the
admiral
coligny
the
british
queen
elizabeth
and
the
protestant
princes
of
germany
supplies
of
men
and
money
from
their
subjects
to
a
degree
which
at
present
is
inconceivable
but
with
all
their
exertions
they
would
have
effected
little
against
a
power
which
was
an
overmatch
for
any
single
adversary
however
powerful
at
this
period
of
imperfect
policy
accidental
circumstances
alone
could
determine
distant
states
to
afford
one
another
a
mutual
support
the
differences
of
government
of
laws
of
language
of
manners
and
of
character
which
hitherto
had
kept
whole
nations
and
countries
as
it
were
insulated
and
raised
a
lasting
barrier
between
them
rendered
one
state
insensible
to
the
distresses
of
another
save
where
national
jealousy
could
indulge
a
malicious
joy
at
the
reverses
of
a
rival
this
barrier
the
reformation
destroyed
an
interest
more
intense
and
more
immediate
than
national
aggrandizement
or
patriotism
and
entirely
independent
of
private
utility
began
to
animate
whole
states
and
individual
citizens
an
interest
capable
of
uniting
numerous
and
distant
nations
even
while
it
frequently
lost
its
force
among
the
subjects
of
the
same
government
with
the
inhabitants
of
geneva

of
england
of
germany
or
of
holland
the
french
calvinist
possessed
a
common
point
of
union
which
he
had
not
with
his
own
countrymen
thus
in
one
important
particular
he
ceased
to
be
the
citizen
of
a
single
state
and
to
confine
his
views
and
sympathies
to
his
own
country
alone
the
sphere
of
his
views
became
enlarged
he
began
to
calculate
his
own
fate
from
that
of
other
nations
of
the
same
religious
profession
and
to
make
their
cause
his
own
now

the
first
time

princes
venture
to
bring
the
affairs

countries

councils
for
the

time

they
hope
for
a
willing
ear
to
their
own
necessities
and
prompt
assistance
from
others
foreign
affairs
had
now
become
a
matter
of
domestic
policy
and
that
aid
was
readily
granted
to
the
religious
confederate
which
would
have
been
denied

the

still

of

and
the
liberties
of
the

had
not
the
formidable
power
of

declared
against
them
this
however
appears
certain
that
nothing
so
completely
damped
the
austrian
hopes
of
universal
monarchy
as
the
obstinate
war
which
they
had
to
wage
against
the
new
religious
opinions
under
no
other
circumstances
could
the
weaker
princes
have
roused
their
subjects
to
such
extraordinary
exertions
against
the
ambition
of
austria
or
the
states
themselves
have
united
so
closely
against
the
common
enemy
the
power
of
austria
never
stood
higher
than
after
the
victory
which
charles
gained
over
the
germans
at
muehlberg
with
the
treaty
of
smalcalde
the
freedom
of
germany
lay
as
it
seemed
prostrate
for
ever
but
it
revived
under
maurice
of
saxony
once
its
most
formidable
enemy
all
the
fruits
of
the
victory
of
muehlberg
were
lost
again
in
the
congress
of
passau
and
the
diet
of
augsburg
and
every
scheme
for
civil
and
religious
oppression
terminated
in
the
concessions
of
an
equitable
peace
the
diet
of
augsburg
divided
germany
into
two
religious
and
two
political
parties
by
recognizing
the
independent
rights
and
existence
of
both
hitherto
the
protestants
had
been
looked
on
as
rebels
they
were
henceforth
to
be
regarded
as
brethren
not
indeed
through
affection
but
necessity
by
the
the
confession
of
augsburg
was
allowed
temporarily
to
take
a
sisterly
place
alongside
of
the
olden
religion
though
only
as
a
tolerated
neighbour
to
every
secular
state
was
conceded
the
right
of
establishing
the
religion
it
acknowledged
as
supreme
and
exclusive
within
its
own
territories
and
of
forbidding
the
open
profession
of
its
rival
subjects
were
to
be
free
to
quit
a
country
where
their
own
religion
was
not
tolerated
the
doctrines
of
luther
for
the
first
time
received
a
positive
sanction
and
if
they
were
trampled
under
foot
in
bavaria
and
austria
they
predominated
in
saxony
and
thuringia
but
the
sovereigns
alone
were
to
determine
what
form
of
religion
should
prevail
within
their
territories
the
feelings
of
subjects
who
had
no
representatives
in
the
diet
were
little
attended
to
in
the
pacification
in
the
ecclesiastical
territories
indeed
where
the
unreformed
religion
enjoyed
an
undisputed
supremacy
the
free
exercise
of
their
religion
was
obtained
for
all
who
had
previously
embraced
the
protestant
doctrines
but
this
indulgence
rested
only
on
the
personal
guarantee
of
ferdinand
king
of
the
romans
by
whose
endeavours
chiefly
this
peace
was
effected
a
guarantee
which
being
rejected
by
the
roman
catholic
members
of
the
diet
and
only
inserted
in
the
treaty
under
their
protest
could
not
of
course
have
the
force
of
law
a
system
of
theology
so
called
prepared
by
order
of
the
emperor
charles
for
the
use
of
germany
to
reconcile
the
differences
between
the
roman
catholics
and
the
lutherans
which
however
was
rejected
by
both
parties
ed
if
it
had
been
opinions
only
that
thus
divided
the
minds
of
men
with
what
indifference
would
all
have
regarded
the
division
but
on
these
opinions
depended
riches
dignities
and
rights
and
it
was
this
which
so
deeply
aggravated
the
evils
of
division
of
two
brothers
as
it
were
who
had
hitherto
enjoyed
a
paternal
inheritance
in
common
one
now
remained
while
the
other
was
compelled
to
leave
his
father
house
and
hence
arose
the
necessity
of
dividing
the
patrimony
for
this
separation
which
he
could
not
have
foreseen
the
father
had
made
no
provision
by
the
beneficent
donations
of
pious
ancestors
the
riches
of
the
church
had
been
accumulating
through
a
thousand
years
and
these
benefactors
were
as
much
the
progenitors
of
the
departing
brother
as
of
him
who
remained
was
the
right
of
inheritance
then
to
be
limited
to
the
paternal
house
or
to
be
extended
to
blood
the
gifts
had
been
made
to
the
church
in
communion
with
rome
because
at
that
time
no
other
existed
to
the
as
it
were
because
he
was
as
yet
the
only
son
was
then
a
right
of
primogeniture
to
be
admitted
in
the
church
as
in
noble
families
were
the
pretensions
of
one
party
to
be
favoured
by
a
prescription
from
times
when
the
claims
of
the
other
could
not
have
come
into
existence
could
the
lutherans
be
justly
excluded
from
these
possessions
to
which
the
benevolence
of
their
forefathers
had
contributed
merely
on
the
ground
that
at
the
date
of
their
foundation
the
differences
between
lutheranism
and
romanism
were
unknown
both
parties
have
disputed
and
still
dispute
with
equal
plausibility
on
these
points
both
alike
have
found
it
difficult
to
prove
their
right
law
can
be
applied
only
to
conceivable
cases
and
perhaps
spiritual
foundations
are
not
among
the
number
of
these
and
still
less
where
the
conditions
of
the
founders
generally
extended
to
a
system
of
doctrines
for
how
is
it
conceivable
that
a
permanent
endowment
should
be
made
of
opinions
left
open
to
change
what
law
can
not
decide
is
usually
determined
by
might
and
such
was
the
case
here
the
one
party
held
firmly
all
that
could
no
longer
be
wrested
from
it
the
other
defended
what
it
still
possessed
all
the
bishoprics
and
abbeys
which
had
been
secularized
before
the
peace
remained
with
the
protestants
but
by
an
express
clause
the
unreformed
catholics
provided
that
none
should
thereafter
be
secularized
every
impropriator
of
an
ecclesiastical
foundation
who
held
immediately
of
the
empire
whether
elector
bishop
or
abbot
forfeited
his
benefice
and
dignity
the
moment
he
embraced
the
protestant
belief
he
was
obliged
in
that
event
instantly
to
resign
its
emoluments
and
the
chapter
was
to
proceed
to
a
new
election
exactly
as
if
his
place
had
been
vacated
by
death
by
this
sacred
anchor
of
the
ecclesiastical
reservation
ecclesiasticum
which
makes
the
temporal
existence
of
a
spiritual
prince
entirely
dependent
on
his
fidelity
to
the
olden
religion
the
roman
catholic
church
in
germany
is
still
held
fast
and
precarious
indeed
would
be
its
situation
were
this
anchor
to
give
way
the
principle
of
the
ecclesiastical
reservation
was
strongly
opposed
by
the
protestants
and
though
it
was
at
last
adopted
into
the
treaty
of
peace
its
insertion
was
qualified
with
the
declaration
that
parties
had
come
to
no
final
determination
on
the
point
could
it
then
be
more
binding
on
the
protestants
than
ferdinand
guarantee
in
favour
of
protestant
subjects
of
ecclesiastical
states
was
upon
the
roman
catholics
thus
were
two
important
subjects
of
dispute
left
unsettled
in
the
treaty
of
peace
and
by
them
the
war
was
rekindled
such
was
the
position
of
things
with
regard
to
religious
toleration
and
ecclesiastical
property
it
was
the
same
with
regard
to
rights
and
dignities
the
existing
german
system
provided
only
for
one
church
because
one
only
was
in
existence
when
that
system
was
framed
the
church
had
now
divided
the
diet
had
broken
into
two
religious
parties
was
the
whole
system
of
the
empire
still
exclusively
to
follow
the
one
the
emperors
had
hitherto
been
members
of
the
romish
church
because
till
now
that
religion
had
no
rival
but
was
it
his
connexion
with
rome
which
constituted
a
german
emperor
or
was
it
not
rather
germany
which
was
to
be
represented
in
its
head
the
protestants
were
now
spread
over
the
whole
empire
and
how
could
they
justly
still
be
represented
by
an
unbroken
line
of
roman
catholic
emperors
in
the
imperial
chamber
the
german
states
judge
themselves
for
they
elect
the
judges
it
was
the
very
end
of
its
institution
that
they
should
do
so
in
order
that
equal
justice
should
be
dispensed
to
all
but
would
this
be
still
possible
if
the
representatives
of
both
professions
were
not
equally
admissible
to
a
seat
in
the
chamber
that
one
religion
only
existed
in
germany
at
the
time
of
its
establishment
was
accidental
that
no
one
estate
should
have
the
means
of
legally
oppressing
another
was
the
essential
purpose
of
the
institution
now
this
object
would
be
entirely
frustrated
if
one
religious
party
were
to
have
the
exclusive
power
of
deciding
for
the
other
must
then
the
design
be
sacrificed
because
that
which
was
merely
accidental
had
changed
with
great
difficulty
the
protestants
at
last
obtained
for
the
representatives
of
their
religion
a
place
in
the
supreme
council
but
still
there
was
far
from
being
a
perfect
equality
of
voices
to
this
day
no
protestant
prince
has
been
raised
to
the
imperial
throne
whatever
may
be
said
of
the
equality
which
the
peace
of
augsburg
was
to
have
established
between
the
two
german
churches
the
roman
catholic
had
unquestionably
still
the
advantage
all
that
the
lutheran
church
gained
by
it
was
toleration
all
that
the
romish
church
conceded
was
a
sacrifice
to
necessity
not
an
offering
to
justice
very
far
was
it
from
being
a
peace
between
two
equal
powers
but
a
truce
between
a
sovereign
and
unconquered
rebels
from
this
principle
all
the
proceedings
of
the
roman
catholics
against
the
protestants
seemed
to
flow
and
still
continue
to
do
so
to
join
the
reformed
faith
was
still
a
crime
since
it
was
to
be
visited
with
so
severe
a
penalty
as
that
which
the
ecclesiastical
reservation
held
suspended
over
the
apostacy
of
the
spiritual
princes
even
to
the
last
the
romish
church
preferred
to
risk
to
loss
of
every
thing
by
force
than
voluntarily
to
yield
the
smallest
matter
to
justice
the
loss
was
accidental
and
might
be
repaired
but
the
abandonment
of
its
pretensions
the
concession
of
a
single
point
to
the
protestants
would
shake
the
foundations
of
the
church
itself
even
in
the
treaty
of
peace
this
principle
was
not
lost
sight
of
whatever
in
this
peace
was
yielded
to
the
protestants
was
always
under
condition
it
was
expressly
declared
that
affairs
were
to
remain
on
the
stipulated
footing
only
till
the
next
general
council
which
was
to
be
called
with
the
view
of
effecting
an
union
between
the
two
confessions
then
only
when
this
last
attempt
should
have
failed
was
the
religious
treaty
to
become
valid
and
conclusive
however
little
hope
there
might
be
of
such
a
reconciliation
however
little
perhaps
the
romanists
themselves
were
in
earnest
with
it
still
it
was
something
to
have
clogged
the
peace
with
these
stipulations
thus
this
religious
treaty
which
was
to
extinguish
for
ever
the
flames
of
civil
war
was
in
fact
but
a
temporary
truce
extorted
by
force
and
necessity
not
dictated
by
justice
nor
emanating
from
just
notions
either
of
religion
or
toleration
a
religious
treaty
of
this
kind
the
roman
catholics
were
as
incapable
of
granting
to
be
candid
as
in
truth
the
lutherans
were
unqualified
to
receive
far
from
evincing
a
tolerant
spirit
towards
the
roman
catholics
when
it
was
in
their
power
they
even
oppressed
the
calvinists
who
indeed
just
as
little
deserved
toleration
since
they
were
unwilling
to
practise
it
for
such
a
peace
the
times
were
not
yet
ripe
the
minds
of
men
not
yet
sufficiently
enlightened
how
could
one
party
expect
from
another
what
itself
was
incapable
of
performing
what
each
side
saved
or
gained
by
the
treaty
of
augsburg
it
owed
to
the
imposing
attitude
of
strength
which
it
maintained
at
the
time
of
its
negociation
what
was
won
by
force
was
to
be
maintained
also
by
force
if
the
peace
was
to
be
permanent
the
two
parties
to
it
must
preserve
the
same
relative
positions
the
boundaries
of
the
two
churches
had
been
marked
out
with
the
sword
with
the
sword
they
must
be
preserved
or
woe
to
that
party
which
should
be
first
disarmed
a
sad
and
fearful
prospect
for
the
tranquillity
of
germany
when
peace
itself
bore
so
threatening
an
aspect
a
momentary
lull
now
pervaded
the
empire
a
transitory
bond
of
concord
appeared
to
unite
its
scattered
limbs
into
one
body
so
that
for
a
time
a
feeling
also
for
the
common
weal
returned
but
the
division
had
penetrated
its
inmost
being
and
to
restore
its
original
harmony
was
impossible
carefully
as
the
treaty
of
peace
appeared
to
have
defined
the
rights
of
both
parties
its
interpretation
was
nevertheless
the
subject
of
many
disputes
in
the
heat
of
conflict
it
had
produced
a
cessation
of
hostilities
it
covered
not
extinguished
the
fire
and
unsatisfied
claims
remained
on
either
side
the
romanists
imagined
they
had
lost
too
much
the
protestants
that
they
had
gained
too
little
and
the
treaty
which
neither
party
could
venture
to
violate
was
interpreted
by
each
in
its
own
favour
the
seizure
of
the
ecclesiastical
benefices
the
motive
which
had
so
strongly
tempted
the
majority
of
the
protestant
princes
to
embrace
the
doctrines
of
luther
was
not
less
powerful
after
than
before
the
peace
of
those
whose
founders
had
not
held
their
fiefs
immediately
of
the
empire
such
as
were
not
already
in
their
possession
would
it
was
evident
soon
be
so
the
whole
of
lower
germany
was
already
secularized
and
if
it
were
otherwise
in
upper
germany
it
was
owing
to
the
vehement
resistance
of
the
catholics
who
had
there
the
preponderance
each
party
where
it
was
the
most
powerful
oppressed
the
adherents
of
the
other
the
ecclesiastical
princes
in
particular
as
the
most
defenceless
members
of
the
empire
were
incessantly
tormented
by
the
ambition
of
their
protestant
neighbours
those
who
were
too
weak
to
repel
force
by
force
took
refuge
under
the
wings
of
justice
and
the
complaints
of
spoliation
were
heaped
up
against
the
protestants
in
the
imperial
chamber
which
was
ready
enough
to
pursue
the
accused
with
judgments
but
found
too
little
support
to
carry
them
into
effect
the
peace
which
stipulated
for
complete
religious
toleration
for
the
dignitaries
of
the
empire
had
provided
also
for
the
subject
by
enabling
him
without
interruption
to
leave
the
country
in
which
the
exercise
of
his
religion
was
prohibited
but
from
the
wrongs
which
the
violence
of
a
sovereign
might
inflict
on
an
obnoxious
subject
from
the
nameless
oppressions
by
which
he
might
harass
and
annoy
the
emigrant
from
the
artful
snares
in
which
subtilty
combined
with
power
might
enmesh
him
from
these
the
dead
letter
of
the
treaty
could
afford
him
no
protection
the
catholic
subject
of
protestant
princes
complained
loudly
of
violations
of
the
religious
peace
the
lutherans
still
more
loudly
of
the
oppression
they
experienced
under
their
romanist
suzerains
the
rancour
and
animosities
of
theologians
infused
a
poison
into
every
occurrence
however
inconsiderable
and
inflamed
the
minds
of
the
people
happy
would
it
have
been
had
this
theological
hatred
exhausted
its
zeal
upon
the
common
enemy
instead
of
venting
its
virus
on
the
adherents
of
a
kindred
faith
unanimity
amongst
the
protestants
might
by
preserving
the
balance
between
the
contending
parties
have
prolonged
the
peace
but
as
if
to
complete
the
confusion
all
concord
was
quickly
broken
the
doctrines
which
had
been
propagated
by
zuingli
in
zurich
and
by
calvin
in
geneva
soon
spread
to
germany
and
divided
the
protestants
among
themselves
with
little
in
unison
save
their
common
hatred
to
popery
the
protestants
of
this
date
bore
but
slight
resemblance
to
those
who
fifty
years
before
drew
up
the
confession
of
augsburg
and
the
cause
of
the
change
is
to
be
sought
in
that
confession
itself
it
had
prescribed
a
positive
boundary
to
the
protestant
faith
before
the
newly
awakened
spirit
of
inquiry
had
satisfied
itself
as
to
the
limits
it
ought
to
set
and
the
protestants
seemed
unwittingly
to
have
thrown
away
much
of
the
advantage
acquired
by
their
rejection
of
popery
common
complaints
of
the
romish
hierarchy
and
of
ecclesiastical
abuses
and
a
common
disapprobation
of
its
dogmas
formed
a
sufficient
centre
of
union
for
the
protestants
but
not
content
with
this
they
sought
a
rallying
point
in
the
promulgation
of
a
new
and
positive
creed
in
which
they
sought
to
embody
the
distinctions
the
privileges
and
the
essence
of
the
church
and
to
this
they
referred
the
convention
entered
into
with
their
opponents
it
was
as
professors
of
this
creed
that
they
had
acceded
to
the
treaty
and
in
the
benefits
of
this
peace
the
advocates
of
the
confession
were
alone
entitled
to
participate
in
any
case
therefore
the
situation
of
its
adherents
was
embarrassing
if
a
blind
obedience
were
yielded
to
the
dicta
of
the
confession
a
lasting
bound
would
be
set
to
the
spirit
of
inquiry
if
on
the
other
hand
they
dissented
from
the
formulae
agreed
upon
the
point
of
union
would
be
lost
unfortunately
both
incidents
occurred
and
the
evil
results
of
both
were
quickly
felt
one
party
rigorously
adhered
to
the
original
symbol
of
faith
and
the
other
abandoned
it
only
to
adopt
another
with
equal
exclusiveness
nothing
could
have
furnished
the
common
enemy
a
more
plausible
defence
of
his
cause
than
this
dissension
no
spectacle
could
have
been
more
gratifying
to
him
than
the
rancour
with
which
the
protestants
alternately
persecuted
each
other
who
could
condemn
the
roman
catholics
if
they
laughed
at
the
audacity
with
which
the
reformers
had
presumed
to
announce
the
only
true
belief
if
from
protestants
they
borrowed
the
weapons
against
protestants
if
in
the
midst
of
this
clashing
of
opinions
they
held
fast
to
the
authority
of
their
own
church
for
which
in
part
there
spoke
an
honourable
antiquity
and
a
yet
more
honourable
plurality
of
voices
but
this
division
placed
the
protestants
in
still
more
serious
embarrassments
as
the
covenants
of
the
treaty
applied
only
to
the
partisans
of
the
confession
their
opponents
with
some
reason
called
upon
them
to
explain
who
were
to
be
recognized
as
the
adherents
of
that
creed
the
lutherans
could
not
without
offending
conscience
include
the
calvinists
in
their
communion
except
at
the
risk
of
converting
a
useful
friend
into
a
dangerous
enemy
could
they
exclude
them
this
unfortunate
difference
opened
a
way
for
the
machinations
of
the
jesuits
to
sow
distrust
between
both
parties
and
to
destroy
the
unity
of
their
measures
fettered
by
the
double
fear
of
their
direct
adversaries
and
of
their
opponents
among
themselves
the
protestants
lost
for
ever
the
opportunity
of
placing
their
church
on
a
perfect
equality
with
the
catholic
all
these
difficulties
would
have
been
avoided
and
the
defection
of
the
calvinists
would
not
have
prejudiced
the
common
cause
if
the
point
of
union
had
been
placed
simply
in
the
abandonment
of
romanism
instead
of
in
the
confession
of
augsburg
but
however
divided
on
other
points
they
concurred
in
this
that
the
security
which
had
resulted
from
equality
of
power
could
only
be
maintained
by
the
preservation
of
that
balance
in
the
meanwhile
the
continual
reforms
of
one
party
and
the
opposing
measures
of
the
other
kept
both
upon
the
watch
while
the
interpretation
of
the
religious
treaty
was
a
subject
of
dispute
each
party
maintained
that
every
step
taken
by
its
opponent
was
an
infraction
of
the
peace
while
of
every
movement
of
its
own
it
was
asserted
that
it
was
essential
to
its
maintenance
yet
all
the
measures
of
the
catholics
did
not
as
their
opponents
alleged
proceed
from
a
spirit
of
encroachment
many
of
them
were
the
necessary
precautions
of
the
protestants
had
shown
unequivocally
enough
what
the
romanists
might
expect
if
they
were
unfortunate
enough
to
become
the
weaker
party
the
greediness
of
the
former
for
the
property
of
the
church
gave
no
reason
to
expect
indulgence
their
bitter
hatred
left
no
hope
of
magnanimity
or
forbearance
but
the
protestants
likewise
were
excusable
if
they
too
placed
little
confidence
in
the
sincerity
of
the
roman
catholics
by
the
treacherous
and
inhuman
treatment
which
their
brethren
in
spain
france
and
the
netherlands
had
suffered
by
the
disgraceful
subterfuge
of
the
romish
princes
who
held
that
the
pope
had
power
to
relieve
them
from
the
obligation
of
the
most
solemn
oaths
and
above
all
by
the
detestable
maxim
that
faith
was
not
to
be
kept
with
heretics
the
roman
church
in
the
eyes
of
all
honest
men
had
lost
its
honour
no
engagement
no
oath
however
sacred
from
a
roman
catholic
could
satisfy
a
protestant
what
security
then
could
the
religious
peace
afford
when
throughout
germany
the
jesuits
represented
it
as
a
measure
of
mere
temporary
convenience
and
in
rome
itself
it
was
solemnly
repudiated
the
general
council
to
which
reference
had
been
made
in
the
treaty
had
already
been
held
in
the
city
of
trent
but
as
might
have
been
foreseen
without
accommodating
the
religious
differences
or
taking
a
single
step
to
effect
such
accommodation
and
even
without
being
attended
by
the
protestants
the
latter
indeed
were
now
solemnly
excommunicated
by
it
in
the
name
of
the
church
whose
representative
the
council
gave
itself
out
to
be
could
then
a
secular
treaty
extorted
moreover
by
force
of
arms
afford
them
adequate
protection
against
the
ban
of
the
church
a
treaty
too
based
on
a
condition
which
the
decision
of
the
council
seemed
entirely
to
abolish
there
was
then
a
show
of
right
for
violating
the
peace
if
only
the
romanists
possessed
the
power
and
henceforward
the
protestants
were
protected
by
nothing
but
the
respect
for
their
formidable
array
other
circumstances
combined
to
augment
this
distrust
spain
on
whose
support
the
romanists
in
germany
chiefly
relied
was
engaged
in
a
bloody
conflict
with
the
flemings
by
it
the
flower
of
the
spanish
troops
were
drawn
to
the
confines
of
germany
with
what
ease
might
they
be
introduced
within
the
empire
if
a
decisive
stroke
should
render
their
presence
necessary
germany
was
at
that
time
a
magazine
of
war
for
nearly
all
the
powers
of
europe
the
religious
war
had
crowded
it
with
soldiers
whom
the
peace
left
destitute
its
many
independent
princes
found
it
easy
to
assemble
armies
and
afterwards
for
the
sake
of
gain
or
the
interests
of
party

other
powers

troops
philip

war
against
the
netherlands
and
with

troops
they
defended
themselves
every
such
levy
in
germany
was
a
subject
of
alarm
to
the
one
party
or
the
other
since
it
might
be
intended
for
their
oppression
the
arrival
of
an
ambassador
an
extraordinary
legate
of
the
pope
a
conference
of
princes
every
unusual
incident
must
it
was
thought
be
pregnant
with
destruction
to
some
party
thus
for
nearly
half
a
century
stood
germany
her
hand
upon
the
sword
every
rustle
of
a
leaf
alarmed
her
ferdinand

first
king
of

and
his
excellent
son
maximilian
the
second

at
this
memorable
epoch
the
reins
of
government
with
a
heart
full
of
sincerity
with
a
truly
heroic
patience
had
ferdinand
brought
about
the
religious
peace
of
augsburg
and
afterwards
in
the
council
of
trent
laboured
assiduously
though
vainly
at
the
ungrateful
task
of
reconciling
the
two
religions
abandoned
by
his
nephew
philip
of
spain
and
hard
pressed
both
in
hungary
and
transylvania
by
the
victorious
armies
of
the
turks
it
was
not
likely
that
this
emperor
would
entertain
the
idea
of
violating
the
religious
peace
and
thereby
destroying
his
own
painful
work
the
heavy
expenses
of
the
perpetually
recurring
war
with
turkey
could
not
be
defrayed
by
the
meagre
contributions
of
his
exhausted
hereditary
dominions
he
stood
therefore
in
need
of
the
assistance
of
the
whole
empire
and
the
religious
peace
alone
preserved
in
one
body
the
otherwise
divided
empire
financial
necessities
made
the
protestant
as
needful
to
him
as
the
romanist
and
imposed
upon
him
the
obligation
of
treating
both
parties
with
equal
justice
which
amidst
so
many
contradictory
claims
was
truly
a
colossal
task
very
far
however
was
the
result
from
answering
his
expectations
his
indulgence
of
the
protestants
served
only
to
bring
upon
his
successors
a
war
which
death
saved
himself
the
mortification
of
witnessing
scarcely
more
fortunate
was
his
son
maximilian
with
whom
perhaps
the
pressure
of
circumstances
was
the
only
obstacle
and
a
longer
life
perhaps
the
only
want
to
his
establishing
the
new
religion
upon
the
imperial
throne
necessity
had
taught
the
father
forbearance
towards
the
protestants
necessity
and
justice
dictated
the
same
course
to
the
son
the
grandson
had
reason
to
repent
that
he
neither
listened
to
justice
nor
yielded
to
necessity
maximilian
left
six
sons
of
whom
the
eldest
the
archduke
rodolph
inherited
his
dominions
and
ascended
the
imperial
throne
the
other
brothers
were
put
off
with
petty
appanages
a
few
mesne
fiefs
were
held
by
a
collateral
branch
which
had
their
uncle
charles
of
styria
at
its
head
and
even
these
were
afterwards
under
his
son
ferdinand
the
second
incorporated
with
the
rest
of
the
family
dominions
with
this
exception
the
whole
of
the
imposing
power
of
austria
was
now
wielded
by
a
single
but
unfortunately
weak
hand
rodolph
the
second
was
not
devoid
of
those
virtues
which
might
have
gained
him
the
esteem
of
mankind
had
the
lot
of
a
private
station
fallen
to
him
his
character
was
mild
he
loved
peace
and
the
sciences
particularly
astronomy
natural
history
chemistry
and
the
study
of
antiquities
to
these
he
applied
with
a
passionate
zeal
which
at
the
very
time
when
the
critical
posture
of
affairs
demanded
all
his
attention
and
his
exhausted
finances
the
most
rigid
economy
diverted
his
attention
from
state
affairs
and
involved
him
in
pernicious
expenses
his
taste
for
astronomy
soon
lost
itself
in
those
astrological
reveries
to
which
timid
and
melancholy
temperaments
like
his
are
but
too
disposed
this
together
with
a
youth
passed
in
spain
opened
his
ears
to
the
evil
counsels
of
the
jesuits
and
the
influence
of
the
spanish
court
by
which
at
last
he
was
wholly
governed
ruled
by
tastes
so
little
in
accordance
with
the
dignity
of
his
station
and
alarmed
by
ridiculous
prophecies
he
withdrew
after
the
spanish
custom
from
the
eyes
of
his
subjects
to
bury
himself
amidst
his
gems
and
antiques
or
to
make
experiments
in
his
laboratory
while
the
most
fatal
discords
loosened
all
the
bands
of
the
empire
and
the
flames
of
rebellion
began
to
burst
out
at
the
very
footsteps
of
his
throne
all
access
to
his
person
was
denied
the
most
urgent
matters
were
neglected
the
prospect
of
the
rich
inheritance
of
spain
was
closed
against
him
while
he
was
trying
to
make
up
his
mind
to
offer
his
hand
to
the
infanta
isabella
a
fearful
anarchy
threatened
the
empire
for
though
without
an
heir
of
his
own
body
he
could
not
be
persuaded
to
allow
the
election
of
a
king
of
the
romans
the
austrian
states
renounced
their
allegiance
hungary
and
transylvania
threw
off
his
supremacy
and
bohemia
was
not
slow
in
following
their
example
the
descendant
of
the
once
so
formidable
charles
the
fifth
was
in
perpetual
danger
either
of
losing
one
part
of
his
possessions
to
the
turks
or
another
to
the
protestants
and
of
sinking
beyond
redemption
under
the
formidable
coalition
which
a
great
monarch
of
europe
had
formed
against
him
the
events
which
now
took
place
in
the
interior
of
germany
were
such
as
usually
happened
when
either
the
throne
was
without
an
emperor
or
the
emperor
without
a
sense
of
his
imperial
dignity
outraged
or
abandoned
by
their
head
the
states
of
the
empire
were
left
to
help
themselves
and
alliances
among
themselves
must
supply
the
defective
authority
of
the
emperor
germany
was
divided
into
two
leagues
which
stood
in
arms
arrayed
against
each
other
between
both
rodolph
the
despised
opponent
of
the
one
and
the
impotent
protector
of
the
other
remained
irresolute
and
useless
equally
unable
to
destroy
the
former
or
to
command
the
latter
what
had
the
empire
to
look
for
from
a
prince
incapable
even
of
defending
his
hereditary
dominions
against
its
domestic
enemies
to
prevent
the
utter
ruin
of
the
house
of
austria
his
own
family
combined
against
him
and
a
powerful
party
threw
itself
into
the
arms
of
his
brother
driven
from
his
hereditary
dominions
nothing
was
now
left
him
to
lose
but
the
imperial
dignity
and
he
was
only
spared
this
last
disgrace
by
a
timely
death
at
this
critical
moment
when
only
a
supple
policy
united
with
a
vigorous
arm
could
have
maintained
the
tranquillity
of
the
empire
its
evil
genius
gave
it
a
rodolph
for
emperor
at
a
more
peaceful
period
the
germanic
union
would
have
managed
its
own
interests
and
rodolph
like
so
many
others
of
his
rank
might
have
hidden
his
deficiencies
in
a
mysterious
obscurity
but
the
urgent
demand
for
the
qualities
in
which
he
was
most
deficient
revealed
his
incapacity
the
position
of
germany
called
for
an
emperor
who
by
his
known
energies
could
give
weight
to
his
resolves
and
the
hereditary
dominions
of
rodolph
considerable
as
they
were
were
at
present
in
a
situation
to
occasion
the
greatest
embarrassment
to
the
governors
the
austrian
princes
it
is
true
were
roman
catholics
and
in
addition
to
that
the
supporters
of
popery
but
their
countries
were
far
from
being
so
the
reformed
opinions
had
penetrated
even
these
and
favoured
by
ferdinand
necessities
and
maximilian
mildness
had
met
with
a
rapid
success
the
austrian
provinces
exhibited
in
miniature
what
germany
did
on
a
larger
scale
the
great
nobles
and
the
ritter
class
or
knights
were
chiefly
evangelical
and
in
the
cities
the
protestants
had
a
decided
preponderance
if
they
succeeded
in
bringing
a
few
of
their
party
into
the
country
they
contrived
imperceptibly
to
fill
all
places
of
trust
and
the
magistracy
with
their
own
adherents
and
to
exclude
the
catholics
against
the
numerous
order
of
the
nobles
and
knights
and
the
deputies
from
the
towns
the
voice
of
a
few
prelates
was
powerless
and
the
unseemly
ridicule
and
offensive
contempt
of
the
former
soon
drove
them
entirely
from
the
provincial
diets
thus
the
whole
of
the
austrian
diet
had
imperceptibly
become
protestant
and
the
reformation
was
making
rapid
strides
towards
its
public
recognition
the
prince
was
dependent
on
the
estates
who
had
it
in
their
power
to
grant
or
refuse
supplies
accordingly
they
availed
themselves
of
the
financial
necessities
of
ferdinand
and
his
son
to
extort
one
religious
concession
after
another
to
the
nobles
and
knights
maximilian
at
last
conceded
the
free
exercise
of
their
religion
but
only
within
their
own
territories
and
castles
the
intemperate
enthusiasm
of
the
protestant
preachers
overstepped
the
boundaries
which
prudence
had
prescribed
in
defiance
of
the
express
prohibition
several
of
them
ventured
to
preach
publicly
not
only
in
the
towns
but
in
vienna
itself
and
the
people
flocked
in
crowds
to
this
new
doctrine
the
best
seasoning
of
which
was
personality
and
abuse
thus
continued
food
was
supplied
to
fanaticism
and
the
hatred
of
two
churches
that
were
such
near
neighbours
was
farther
envenomed
by
the
sting
of
an
impure
zeal
among
the
hereditary
dominions
of
the
house
of
austria
hungary
and
transylvania
were
the
most
unstable
and
the
most
difficult
to
retain
the
impossibility
of
holding
these
two
countries
against
the
neighbouring
and
overwhelming
power
of
the
turks
had
already
driven
ferdinand
to
the
inglorious
expedient
of
recognizing
by
an
annual
tribute
the
porte
supremacy
over
transylvania
a
shameful
confession
of
weakness
and
a
still
more
dangerous
temptation
to
the
turbulent
nobility
when
they
fancied
they
had
any
reason
to
complain
of
their
master
not
without
conditions
had
the
hungarians
submitted
to
the
house
of
austria
they
asserted
the
elective
freedom
of
their
crown
and
boldly
contended
for
all
those
prerogatives
of
their
order
which
are
inseparable
from
this
freedom
of
election
the
near
neighbourhood
of
turkey
the
facility
of
changing
masters
with
impunity
encouraged
the
magnates
still
more
in
their
presumption
discontented
with
the
austrian
government
they
threw
themselves
into
the
arms
of
the
turks
dissatisfied
with
these
they
returned
again
to
their
german
sovereigns
the
frequency
and
rapidity
of
these
transitions
from
one
government
to
another
had
communicated
its
influences
also
to
their
mode
of
thinking
and
as
their
country
wavered
between
the
turkish
and
austrian
rule
so
their
minds
vacillated
between
revolt
and
submission
the
more
unfortunate
each
nation
felt
itself
in
being
degraded
into
a
province
of
a
foreign
kingdom
the
stronger
desire
did
they
feel
to
obey
a
monarch
chosen
from
amongst
themselves
and
thus
it
was
always
easy
for
an
enterprising
noble
to
obtain
their
support
the
nearest
turkish
pasha
was
always
ready
to
bestow
the
hungarian
sceptre
and
crown
on
a
rebel
against
austria
just
as
ready
was
austria
to
confirm
to
any
adventurer
the
possession
of
provinces
which
he
had
wrested
from
the
porte
satisfied
with
preserving
thereby
the
shadow
of
authority
and
with
erecting
at
the
same
time
a
barrier
against
the
turks
in
this
way
several
of
these
magnates
batbori
boschkai
ragoczi
and
bethlen
succeeded
in
establishing
themselves
one
after
another
as
tributary
sovereigns
in
transylvania
and
hungary
and
they
maintained
their
ground
by
no
deeper
policy
than
that
of
occasionally
joining
the
enemy
in
order
to
render
themselves
more
formidable
to
their
own
prince
ferdinand
maximilian
and
rodolph
who
were
all
sovereigns
of
hungary
and
transylvania
exhausted
their
other
territories
in
endeavouring
to
defend
these
from
the
hostile
inroads
of
the
turks
and
to
put
down
intestine
rebellion
in
this
quarter
destructive
wars
were
succeeded
but
by
brief
truces
which
were
scarcely
less
hurtful
far
and
wide
the
land
lay
waste
while
the
injured
serf
had
to
complain
equally
of
his
enemy
and
his
protector
into
these
countries
also
the
reformation
had
penetrated
and
protected
by
the
freedom
of
the
states
and
under
the
cover
of
the
internal
disorders
had
made
a
noticeable
progress
here
too
it
was
incautiously
attacked
and
party
spirit
thus
became
yet
more
dangerous
from
religious
enthusiasm
headed
by
a
bold
rebel
boschkai
the
nobles
of
hungary
and
transylvania
raised
the
standard
of
rebellion
the
hungarian
insurgents
were
upon
the
point
of
making
common
cause
with
the
discontented
protestants
in
austria
moravia
and
bohemia
and
uniting
all
those
countries
in
one
fearful
revolt
the
downfall
of
popery
in
these
lands
would
then
have
been
inevitable
long
had
the
austrian
archdukes
the
brothers
of
the
emperor
beheld
with
silent
indignation
the
impending
ruin
of
their
house
this
last
event
hastened
their
decision
the
archduke
matthias
maximilian
second
son
viceroy
in
hungary
and
rodolph
presumptive
heir
now
came
forward
as
the
stay
of
the
falling
house
of
hapsburg
in
his
youth
misled
by
a
false
ambition
this
prince
disregarding
the
interests
of
his
family
had
listened
to
the
overtures
of
the
flemish
insurgents
who
invited
him
into
the
netherlands
to
conduct
the
defence
of
their
liberties
against
the
oppression
of
his
own
relative
philip
the
second
mistaking
the
voice
of
an
insulated
faction
for
that
of
the
entire
nation
matthias
obeyed
the
call
but
the
event
answered
the
expectations
of
the
men
of
brabant
as
little
as
his
own
and
from
this
imprudent
enterprise
he
retired
with
little
credit
far
more
honourable
was
his
second
appearance
in
the
political
world
perceiving
that
his
repeated
remonstrances
with
the
emperor
were
unavailing
he
assembled
the
archdukes
his
brothers
and
cousins
at
presburg
and
consulted
with
them
on
the
growing
perils
of
their
house
when
they
unanimously
assigned
to
him
as
the
oldest
the
duty
of
defending
that
patrimony
which
a
feeble
brother
was
endangering
in
his
hands
they
placed
all
their
powers
and
rights
and
vested
him
with
sovereign
authority
to
act
at
his
discretion
for
the
common
good
matthias
immediately
opened
a
communication
with
the
porte
and
the
hungarian
rebels
and
through
his
skilful
management
succeeded
in
saving
by
a
peace
with
the
turks
the
remainder
of
hungary
and
by
a
treaty
with
the
rebels
preserved
the
claims
of
austria
to
the
lost
provinces
but
rodolph
as
jealous
as
he
had
hitherto
been
careless
of
his
sovereign
authority
refused
to
ratify
this
treaty
which
he
regarded
as
a
criminal
encroachment
on
his
sovereign
rights
he
accused
the
archduke
of
keeping
up
a
secret
understanding
with
the
enemy
and
of
cherishing
treasonable
designs
on
the
crown
of
hungary
the
activity
of
matthias
was
in
truth
anything
but
disinterested
the
conduct
of
the
emperor
only
accelerated
the
execution
of
his
ambitious
views
secure
from
motives
of
gratitude
of
the
devotion
of
the
hungarians
for
whom
he
had
so
lately
obtained
the
blessings
of
peace
assured
by
his
agents
of
the
favourable
disposition
of
the
nobles
and
certain
of
the
support
of
a
large
party
even
in
austria
he
now
ventured
to
assume
a
bolder
attitude
and
sword
in
hand
to
discuss
his
grievances
with
the
emperor
the
protestants
in
austria
and
moravia
long
ripe
for
revolt
and
now
won
over
to
the
archduke
by
his
promises
of
toleration
loudly
and
openly
espoused
his
cause
and
their
alliance
with
the
hungarian
rebels
was
actually
effected
almost
at
once
a
formidable
conspiracy
was
planned
and
matured
against
the
emperor
too
late
did
he
resolve
to
amend
his
past
errors
in
vain
did
he
attempt
to
break
up
this
fatal
alliance
already
the
whole
empire
was
in
arms
hungary
austria
and
moravia
had
done
homage
to
matthias
who
was
already
on
his
march
to
bohemia
to
seize
the
emperor
in
his
palace
and
to
cut
at
once
the
sinews
of
his
power
bohemia
was
not
a
more
peaceable
possession
for
austria
than
hungary
with
this
difference
only
that
in
the
latter
political
considerations
in
the
former
religious
dissensions
fomented
disorders
in
bohemia
a
century
before
the
days
of
luther
the
first
spark
of
the
religious
war
had
been
kindled
a
century
after
luther
the
first
flames
of
the
thirty
years
war
burst
out
in
bohemia
the
sect
which
owed
its
rise
to
john
huss
still
existed
in
that
country
it
agreed
with
the
romish
church
in
ceremonies
and
doctrines
with
the
single
exception
of
the
administration
of
the
communion
in
which
the
hussites
communicated
in
both
kinds
this
privilege
had
been
conceded
to
the
followers
of
huss
by
the
council
of
basle
in
an
express
treaty
the
bohemian
compact
and
though
it
was
afterwards
disavowed
by
the
popes
they
nevertheless
continued
to
profit
by
it
under
the
sanction
of
the
government
as
the
use
of
the
cup
formed
the
only
important
distinction
of
their
body
they
were
usually
designated
by
the
name
of
utraquists
and
they
readily
adopted
an
appellation
which
reminded
them
of
their
dearly
valued
privilege
but
under
this
title
lurked
also
the
far
stricter
sects
of
the
bohemian
and
moravian
brethren
who
differed
from
the
predominant
church
in
more
important
particulars
and
bore
in
fact
a
great
resemblance
to
the
german
protestants
among
them
both
the
german
and
swiss
opinions
on
religion
made
rapid
progress
while
the
name
of
utraquists
under
which
they
managed
to
disguise
the
change
of
their
principles
shielded
them
from
persecution
in
truth
they
had
nothing
in
common
with
the
utraquists
but
the
name
essentially
they
were
altogether
protestant
confident
in
the
strength
of
their
party
and
the
emperor
toleration
under
maximilian
they
had
openly
avowed
their
tenets
after
the
example
of
the
germans
they
drew
up
a
confession
of
their
own
in
which
lutherans
as
well
as
calvinists
recognized
their
own
doctrines
and
they
sought
to
transfer
to
the
new
confession
the
privileges
of
the
original
utraquists
in
this
they
were
opposed
by
their
roman
catholic
countrymen
and
forced
to
rest
content
with
the
emperor
verbal
assurance
of
protection
as
long
as
maximilian
lived
they
enjoyed
complete
toleration
even
under
the
new
form
they
had
taken
under
his
successor
the
scene
changed
an
imperial
edict
appeared
which
deprived
the
bohemian
brethren
of
their
religious
freedom
now
these
differed
in
nothing
from
the
other
utraquists
the
sentence
therefore
of
their
condemnation
obviously
included
all
the
partisans
of
the
bohemian
confession
accordingly
they
all
combined
to
oppose
the
imperial
mandate
in
the
diet
but
without
being
able
to
procure
its
revocation
the
emperor
and
the
roman
catholic
estates
took
their
ground
on
the
compact
and
the
bohemian
constitution
in
which
nothing
appeared
in
favour
of
a
religion
which
had
not
then
obtained
the
voice
of
the
country
since
that
time
how
completely
had
affairs
changed
what
then
formed
but
an
inconsiderable
opinion
had
now
become
the
predominant
religion
of
the
country
and
what
was
it
then
but
a
subterfuge
to
limit
a
newly
spreading
religion
by
the
terms
of
obsolete
treaties
the
bohemian
protestants
appealed
to
the
verbal
guarantee
of
maximilian
and
the
religious
freedom
of
the
germans
with
whom
they
argued
they
ought
to
be
on
a
footing
of
equality
it
was
in
vain
their
appeal
was
dismissed
such
was
the
posture
of
affairs
in
bohemia
when
matthias
already
master
of
hungary
austria
and
moravia
appeared
in
kolin
to
raise
the
bohemian
estates
also
against
the
emperor
the
embarrassment
of
the
latter
was
now
at
its
height
abandoned
by
all
his
other
subjects
he
placed
his
last
hopes
on
the
bohemians
who
it
might
be
foreseen
would
take
advantage
of
his
necessities
to
enforce
their
own
demands
after
an
interval
of
many
years
he
once
more
appeared
publicly
in
the
diet
at
prague
and
to
convince
the
people
that
he
was
really
still
in
existence
orders
were
given
that
all
the
windows
should
be
opened
in
the
streets
through
which
he
was
to
pass
proof
enough
how
far
things
had
gone
with
him
the
event
justified
his
fears
the
estates
conscious
of
their
own
power
refused
to
take
a
single
step
until
their
privileges
were
confirmed
and
religious
toleration
fully
assured
to
them
it
was
in
vain
to
have
recourse
now
to
the
old
system
of
evasion
the
emperor
fate
was
in
their
hands
and
he
must
yield
to
necessity
at
present
however
he
only
granted
their
other
demands
religious
matters
he
reserved
for
consideration
at
the
next
diet
the
bohemians
now
took
up
arms
in
defence
of
the
emperor
and
a
bloody
war
between
the
two
brothers
was
on
the
point
of
breaking
out
but
rodolph
who
feared
nothing
so
much
as
remaining
in
this
slavish
dependence
on
the
estates
waited
not
for
a
warlike
issue
but
hastened
to
effect
a
reconciliation
with
his
brother
by
more
peaceable
means
by
a
formal
act
of
abdication
he
resigned
to
matthias
what
indeed
he
had
no
chance
of
wresting
from
him
austria
and
the
kingdom
of
hungary
and
acknowledged
him
as
his
successor
to
the
crown
of
bohemia
dearly
enough
had
the
emperor
extricated
himself
from
one
difficulty
only
to
get
immediately
involved
in
another
the
settlement
of
the
religious
affairs
of
bohemia
had
been
referred
to
the
next
diet
which
was
held
in
the
reformed
bohemians
demanded
the
free
exercise
of
their
faith
as
under
the
former
emperors
a
consistory
of
their
own
the
cession
of
the
university
of
prague
and
the
right
of
electing
or
of
from
their
own
body
the
answer
was
the
same
as
before
for
the
timid
emperor
was
now
entirely
fettered
by
the
unreformed
party
however
often
and
in
however
threatening
language
the
estates
renewed
their
remonstrances
the
emperor
persisted
in
his
first
declaration
of
granting
nothing
beyond
the
old
compact
the
diet
broke
up
without
coming
to
a
decision
and
the
estates
exasperated
against
the
emperor
arranged
a
general
meeting
at
prague
upon
their
own
authority
to
right
themselves
they
appeared
at
prague
in
great
force
in
defiance
of
the
imperial
prohibition
they
carried
on
their
deliberations
almost
under
the
very
eyes
of
the
emperor
the
yielding
compliance
which
he
began
to
show
only
proved
how
much
they
were
feared
and
increased
their
audacity
yet
on
the
main
point
he
remained
inflexible
they
fulfilled
their
threats
and
at
last
resolved
to
establish
by
their
own
power
the
free
and
universal
exercise
of
their
religion
and
to
abandon
the
emperor
to
his
necessities
until
he
should
confirm
this
resolution
they
even
went
farther
and
elected
for
themselves
the
defenders
which
the
emperor
had
refused
them
ten
were
nominated
by
each
of
the
three
estates
they
also
determined
to
raise
as
soon
as
possible
an
armed
force
at
the
head
of
which
count
thurn
the
chief
organizer
of
the
revolt
should
be
placed
as
general
defender
of
the
liberties
of
bohemia
their
determination
brought
the
emperor
to
submission
to
which
he
was
now
counselled
even
by
the
spaniards
apprehensive
lest
the
exasperated
estates
should
throw
themselves
into
the
arms
of
the
king
of
hungary
he
signed
the
memorable
letter
of
majesty
for
bohemia
by
which
under
the
successors
of
the
emperor
that
people
justified
their
rebellion
the
bohemian
confession
which
the
states
had
laid
before
the
emperor
maximilian
was
by
the
letter
of
majesty
placed
on
a
footing
of
equality
with
the
olden
profession
the
utraquists
for
by
this
title
the
bohemian
protestants
continued
to
designate
themselves
were
put
in
possession
of
the
university
of
prague
and
allowed
a
consistory
of
their
own
entirely
independent
of
the
archiepiscopal
see
of
that
city
all
the
churches
in
the
cities
villages
and
market
towns
which
they
held
at
the
date
of
the
letter
were
secured
to
them
and
if
in
addition
they
wished
to
erect
others
it
was
permitted
to
the
nobles
and
knights
and
the
free
cities
to
do
so
this
last
clause
in
the
letter
of
majesty
gave
rise
to
the
unfortunate
disputes
which
subsequently
rekindled
the
flames
of
war
in
europe
the
letter
of
majesty
erected
the
protestant
part
of
bohemia
into
a
kind
of
republic
the
estates
had
learned
to
feel
the
power
which
they
gained
by
perseverance
unity
and
harmony
in
their
measures
the
emperor
now
retained
little
more
than
the
shadow
of
his
sovereign
authority
while
by
the
new
dignity
of
the
defenders
of
liberty
a
dangerous
stimulus
was
given
to
the
spirit
of
revolt
the
example
and
success
of
bohemia
afforded
a
tempting
seduction
to
the
other
hereditary
dominions
of
austria
and
all
attempted
by
similar
means
to
extort
similar
privileges
the
spirit
of
liberty
spread
from
one
province
to
another
and
as
it
was
chiefly
the
disunion
among
the
austrian
princes
that
had
enabled
the
protestants
so
materially
to
improve
their
advantages
they
now
hastened
to
effect
a
reconciliation
between
the
emperor
and
the
king
of
hungary
but
the
reconciliation
could
not
be
sincere
the
wrong
was
too
great
to
be
forgiven
and
rodolph
continued
to
nourish
at
heart
an
unextinguishable
hatred
of
matthias
with
grief
and
indignation
he
brooded
over
the
thought
that
the
bohemian
sceptre
was
finally
to
descend
into
the
hands
of
his
enemy
and
the
prospect
was
not
more
consoling
even
if
matthias
should
die
without
issue
in
that
case
ferdinand
archduke
of
graetz
whom
he
equally
disliked
was
the
head
of
the
family
to
exclude
the
latter
as
well
as
matthias
from
the
succession
to
the
throne
of
bohemia
he
fell
upon
the
project
of
diverting
that
inheritance
to
ferdinand
brother
the
archduke
leopold
bishop
of
passau
who
among
all
his
relatives
had
ever
been
the
dearest
and
most
deserving
the
prejudices
of
the
bohemians
in
favour
of
the
elective
freedom
of
their
crown
and
their
attachment
to
leopold
person
seemed
to
favour
this
scheme
in
which
rodolph
consulted
rather
his
own
partiality
and
vindictiveness
than
the
good
of
his
house
but
to
carry
out
this
project
a
military
force
was
requisite
and
rodolph
actually
assembled
an
army
in
the
bishopric
of
passau
the
object
of
this
force
was
hidden
from
all
an
inroad
however
which
for
want
of
pay
it
made
suddenly
and
without
the
emperor
knowledge
into
bohemia
and
the
outrages
which
it
there
committed
stirred
up
the
whole
kingdom
against
him
in
vain
he
asserted
his
innocence
to
the
bohemian
estates
they
would
not
believe
his
protestations
vainly
did
he
attempt
to
restrain
the
violence
of
his
soldiery
they
disregarded
his
orders
persuaded
that
the
emperor
object
was
to
annul
the
letter
of
majesty
the
protectors
of
liberty
armed
the
whole
of
protestant
bohemia
and
invited
matthias
into
the
country
after
the
dispersion
of
the
force
he
had
collected
at
passau
the
emperor
remained
helpless
at
prague
where
he
was
kept
shut
up
like
a
prisoner
in
his
palace
and
separated
from
all
his
councillors
in
the
meantime
matthias
entered
prague
amidst
universal
rejoicings
where
rodolph
was
soon
afterwards
weak
enough
to
acknowledge
him
king
of
bohemia
so
hard
a
fate
befell
this
emperor
he
was
compelled
during
his
life
to
abdicate
in
favour
of
his
enemy
that
very
throne
of
which
he
had
been
endeavouring
to
deprive
him
after
his
own
death
to
complete
his
degradation
he
was
obliged
by
a
personal
act
of
renunciation
to
release
his
subjects
in
bohemia
silesia
and
lusatia
from
their
allegiance
and
he
did
it
with
a
broken
heart
all
even
those
he
thought
he
had
most
attached
to
his
person
had
abandoned
him
when
he
had
signed
the
instrument
he
threw
his
hat
upon
the
ground
and
gnawed
the
pen
which
had
rendered
so
shameful
a
service
while
rodolph
thus
lost
one
hereditary
dominion
after
another
the
imperial
dignity
was
not
much
better
maintained
by
him
each
of
the
religious
parties
into
which
germany
was
divided
continued
its
efforts
to
advance
itself
at
the
expense
of
the
other
or
to
guard
against
its
attacks
the
weaker
the
hand
that
held
the
sceptre
and
the
more
the
protestants
and
roman
catholics
felt
they
were
left
to
themselves
the
more
vigilant
necessarily
became
their
watchfulness
and
the
greater
their
distrust
of
each
other
it
was
enough
that
the
emperor
was
ruled
by
jesuits
and
was
guided
by
spanish
counsels
to
excite
the
apprehension
of
the
protestants
and
to
afford
a
pretext
for
hostility
the
rash
zeal
of
the
jesuits
which
in
the
pulpit
and
by
the
press
disputed
the
validity
of
the
religious
peace
increased
this
distrust
and
caused
their
adversaries
to
see
a
dangerous
design
in
the
most
indifferent
measures
of
the
roman
catholics
every
step
taken
in
the
hereditary
dominions
of
the
emperor
for
the
repression
of
the
reformed
religion
was
sure
to
draw
the
attention
of
all
the
protestants
of
germany
and
this
powerful
support
which
the
reformed
subjects
of
austria
met
or
expected
to
meet
with
from
their
religious
confederates
in
the
rest
of
germany
was
no
small
cause
of
their
confidence
and
of
the
rapid
success
of
matthias
it
was
the
general
belief
of
the
empire
that
they
owed
the
long
enjoyment
of
the
religious
peace
merely
to
the
difficulties
in
which
the
emperor
was
placed
by
the
internal
troubles
in
his
dominions
and
consequently
they
were
in
no
haste
to
relieve
him
from
them
almost
all
the
affairs
of
the
diet
were
neglected
either
through
the
procrastination
of
the
emperor
or
through
the
fault
of
the
protestant
estates
who
had
determined
to
make
no
provision
for
the
common
wants
of
the
empire
till
their
own
grievances
were
removed
these
grievances
related
principally
to
the
misgovernment
of
the
emperor
the
violation
of
the
religious
treaty
and
the
presumptuous
usurpations
of
the
aulic
council
which
in
the
present
reign
had
begun
to
extend
its
jurisdiction
at
the
expense
of
the
imperial
chamber
formerly
in
all
disputes
between
the
estates
which
could
not
be
settled
by
club
law
the
emperors
had
in
the
last
resort
decided
of
themselves
if
the
case
were
trifling
and
in
conjunction
with
the
princes
if
it
were
important
or
they
determined
them
by
the
advice
of
imperial
judges
who
followed
the
court
this
superior
jurisdiction
they
had
in
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
assigned
to
a
regular
and
permanent
tribunal
the
imperial
chamber
of
spires
in
which
the
estates
of
the
empire
that
they
might
not
be
oppressed
by
the
arbitrary
appointment
of
the
emperor
had
reserved
to
themselves
the
right
of
electing
the
assessors
and
of
periodically
reviewing
its
decrees
by
the
religious
peace
these
rights
of
the
estates
called
the
rights
of
presentation
and
visitation
were
extended
also
to
the
lutherans
so
that
protestant
judges
had
a
voice
in
protestant
causes
and
a
seeming
equality
obtained
for
both
religions
in
this
supreme
tribunal
but
the
enemies
of
the
reformation
and
of
the
freedom
of
the
estates
vigilant
to
take
advantage
of
every
incident
that
favoured
their
views
soon
found
means
to
neutralize
the
beneficial
effects
of
this
institution
a
supreme
jurisdiction
over
the
imperial
states
was
gradually
and
skilfully
usurped
by
a
private
imperial
tribunal
the
aulic
council
in
vienna
a
court
at
first
intended
merely
to
advise
the
emperor
in
the
exercise
of
his
undoubted
imperial
and
personal
prerogatives
a
court
whose
members
being
appointed
and
paid
by
him
had
no
law
but
the
interest
of
their
master
and
no
standard
of
equity
but
the
advancement
of
the
unreformed
religion
of
which
they
were
partisans
before
the
aulic
council
were
now
brought
several
suits
originating
between
estates
differing
in
religion
and
which
therefore
properly
belonged
to
the
imperial
chamber
it
was
not
surprising
if
the
decrees
of
this
tribunal
bore
traces
of
their
origin
if
the
interests
of
the
roman
church
and
of
the
emperor
were
preferred
to
justice
by
roman
catholic
judges
and
the
creatures
of
the
emperor
although
all
the
estates
of
germany
seemed
to
have
equal
cause
for
resisting
so
perilous
an
abuse
the
protestants
alone
who
most
sensibly
felt
it
and
even
these
not
all
at
once
and
in
a
body
came
forward
as
the
defenders
of
german
liberty
which
the
establishment
of
so
arbitrary
a
tribunal
had
outraged
in
its
most
sacred
point
the
administration
of
justice
in
fact
germany
would
have
had
little
cause
to
congratulate
itself
upon
the
abolition
of
and
in
the
institution
of
the
imperial
chamber
if
an
arbitrary
tribunal
of
the
emperor
was
allowed
to
interfere
with
the
latter
the
estates
of
the
german
empire
would
indeed
have
improved
little
upon
the
days
of
barbarism
if
the
chamber
of
justice
in
which
they
sat
along
with
the
emperor
as
judges
and
for
which
they
had
abandoned
their
original
princely
prerogative
should
cease
to
be
a
court
of
the
last
resort
but
the
strangest
contradictions
were
at
this
date
to
be
found
in
the
minds
of
men
the
name
of
emperor
a
remnant
of
roman
despotism
was
still
associated
with
an
idea
of
autocracy
which
though
it
formed
a
ridiculous
inconsistency
with
the
privileges
of
the
estates
was
nevertheless
argued
for
by
jurists
diffused
by
the
partisans
of
despotism
and
believed
by
the
ignorant
to
these
general
grievances
was
gradually
added
a
chain
of
singular
incidents
which
at
length
converted
the
anxiety
of
the
protestants
into
utter
distrust
during
the
spanish
persecutions
in
the
netherlands
several
protestant
families
had
taken
refuge
in
an
imperial
city
and
attached
to
the
roman
catholic
faith
where
they
settled
and
insensibly
extended
their
adherents
having
succeeded
by
stratagem
in
introducing
some
of
their
members
into
the
municipal
council
they
demanded
a
church
and
the
public
exercise
of
their
worship
and
the
demand
being
unfavourably
received
they
succeeded
by
violence
in
enforcing
it
and
also
in
usurping
the
entire
government
of
the
city
to
see
so
important
a
city
in
protestant
hands
was
too
heavy
a
blow
for
the
emperor
and
the
roman
catholics
after
all
the
emperor
requests
and
commands
for
the
restoration
of
the
olden
government
had
proved
ineffectual
the
aulic
council
proclaimed
the
city
under
the
ban
of
the
empire
which
however
was
not
put
in
force
till
the
following
reign
of
yet
greater
importance
were
two
other
attempts
of
the
protestants
to
extend
their
influence
and
their
power
the
elector
gebhard
of
cologne
born
of
waldburg
conceived
for
the
young
countess
agnes
of
mansfield
canoness
of
gerresheim
a
passion
which
was
not
unreturned
as
the
eyes
of
all
germany
were
directed
to
this
intercourse
the
brothers
of
the
countess
two
zealous
calvinists
demanded
satisfaction
for
the
injured
honour
of
their
house
which
as
long
as
the
elector
remained
a
roman
catholic
prelate
could
not
be
repaired
by
marriage
they
threatened
the
elector
they
would
wash
out
this
stain
in
his
blood
and
their
sister
unless
he
either
abandoned
all
further
connexion
with
the
countess
or
consented
to
her
reputation
at
the
altar
the
elector
indifferent
to
all
the
consequences
of
this
step
listened
to
nothing
but
the
voice
of
love
whether
it
was
in
consequence
of
his
previous
inclination
to
the
reformed
doctrines
or
that
the
charms
of
his
mistress
alone
effected
this
wonder
he
renounced
the
roman
catholic
faith
and
led
the
beautiful
agnes
to
the
altar
of
the
kitchen
this
event
was
of
the
greatest
importance
by
the
letter
of
the
clause
reserving
the
ecclesiastical
states
from
the
general
operation
of
the
religious
peace
the
elector
had
by
his
apostacy
forfeited
all
right
to
the
temporalities
of
his
bishopric
and
if
in
any
case
it
was
important
for
the
catholics
to
enforce
the
clause
it
was
so
especially
in
the
case
of
electorates
on
the
other
hand
the
relinquishment
of
so
high
a
dignity
was
a
severe
sacrifice
and
peculiarly
so
in
the
case
of
a
tender
husband
who
had
wished
to
enhance
the
value
of
his
heart
and
hand
by
the
gift
of
a
principality
moreover
the
reservatum
ecclesiasticum
was
a
disputed
article
of
the
treaty
of
augsburg
and
all
the
german
protestants
were
aware
of
the
extreme
importance
of
wresting
this
electorate
from
the
opponents
of
their
faith
the
example
had
already
been
set
in
several
of
the
ecclesiastical
benefices
of
lower
germany
and
attended
with
success
several
canons
of
cologne
had
also
already
embraced
the
protestant
confession
and
were
on
the
elector
side
while
in
the
city
itself
he
could
depend
upon
the
support
of
a
numerous
protestant
party
all
these
considerations
greatly
strengthened
by
the
persuasions
of
his
friends
and
relations
and
the
promises
of
several
german
courts
determined
the
elector
to
retain
his
dominions
while
he
changed
his
religion
saxony
brandenburg
and
the
palatinate
were
already
protestant
but
it
was
soon
apparent
that
he
had
entered
upon
a
contest
which
he
could
not
carry
through
even
the
free
toleration
of
the
protestant
service
within
the
territories
of
cologne
had
already
occasioned
a
violent
opposition
on
the
part
of
the
canons
and
roman
catholic
of
that
province
the
intervention
of
the
emperor
and
a
papal
ban
from
rome
which
anathematized
the
elector
as
an
apostate
and
deprived
him
of
all
his
dignities
temporal
and
spiritual
armed
his
own
subjects
and
chapter
against
him
the
elector
assembled
a
military
force
the
chapter
did
the
same
to
ensure
also
the
aid
of
a
strong
arm
they
proceeded
forthwith
to
a
new
election
and
chose
the
bishop
of
liege
a
prince
of
bavaria
a
civil
war
now
commenced
which
from
the
strong
interest
which
both
religious
parties
in
germany
necessarily
felt
in
the
conjuncture
was
likely
to
terminate
in
a
general
breaking
up
of
the
religious
peace
what
most
made
the
protestants
indignant
was
that
the
pope
should
have
presumed
by
a
pretended
apostolic
power
to
deprive
a
prince
of
the
empire
of
his
imperial
dignities
even
in
the
golden
days
of
their
spiritual
domination
this
prerogative
of
the
pope
had
been
disputed
how
much
more
likely
was
it
to
be
questioned
at
a
period
when
his
authority
was
entirely
disowned
by
one
party
while
even
with
the
other
it
rested
on
a
tottering
foundation
all
the
protestant
princes
took
up
the
affair
warmly
against
the
emperor
and
henry
iv
of
france
then
king
of
navarre
left
no
means
of
negotiation
untried
to
urge
the
german
princes
to
the
vigorous
assertion
of
their
rights
the
issue
would
decide
for
ever
the
liberties
of
germany
four
protestant
against
three
roman
catholic
voices
in
the
electoral
college
must
at
once
have
given
the
preponderance
to
the
former
and
for
ever
excluded
the
house
of
austria
from
the
imperial
throne
but
the
elector
gebhard
had
embraced
the
calvinist
not
the
lutheran
religion
and
this
circumstance
alone
was
his
ruin
the
mutual
rancour
of
these
two
churches
would
not
permit
the
lutheran
estates
to
regard
the
elector
as
one
of
their
party
and
as
such
to
lend
him
their
effectual
support
all
indeed
had
encouraged
and
promised
him
assistance
but
only
one
appanaged
prince
of
the
palatine
house
the
palsgrave
john
casimir
a
zealous
calvinist
kept
his
word
despite
of
the
imperial
prohibition
he
hastened
with
his
little
army
into
the
territories
of
cologne
but
without
being
able
to
effect
any
thing
because
the
elector
who
was
destitute
even
of
the
first
necessaries
left
him
totally
without
help
so
much
the
more
rapid
was
the
progress
of
the
elector
whom
his
bavarian
relations
and
the
spaniards
from
the
netherlands
supported
with
the
utmost
vigour
the
troops
of
gebhard
left
by
their
master
without
pay
abandoned
one
place
after
another
to
the
enemy
by
whom
others
were
compelled
to
surrender
in
his
westphalian
territories
gebhard
held
out
for
some
time
longer
till
here
too
he
was
at
last
obliged
to
yield
to
superior
force
after
several
vain
attempts
in
holland
and
england
to
obtain
means
for
his
restoration
he
retired
into
the
chapter
of
strasburg
and
died
dean
of
that
cathedral
the
first
sacrifice
to
the
ecclesiastical
reservation
or
rather
to
the
want
of
harmony
among
the
german
protestants
to
this
dispute
in
cologne
was
soon
added
another
in
strasburg
several
protestant
canons
of
cologne
who
had
been
included
in
the
same
papal
ban
with
the
elector
had
taken
refuge
within
this
bishopric
where
they
likewise
held
prebends
as
the
roman
catholic
canons
of
strasburg
hesitated
to
allow
them
as
being
under
the
ban
the
enjoyment
of
their
prebends
they
took
violent
possession
of
their
benefices
and
the
support
of
a
powerful
protestant
party
among
the
citizens
soon
gave
them
the
preponderance
in
the
chapter
the
other
canons
thereupon
retired
to
where
under
the
protection
of
the
bishop
they
established
themselves
as
the
only
lawful
chapter
and
denounced
that
which
remained
in
strasburg
as
illegal
the
latter
in
the
meantime
had
so
strengthened
themselves
by
the
reception
of
several
protestant
colleagues
of
high
rank
that
they
could
venture
upon
the
death
of
the
bishop
to
nominate
a
new
protestant
bishop
in
the
person
of
john
george
of
brandenburg
the
roman
catholic
canons
far
from
allowing
this
election
nominated
the
bishop
of
metz
a
prince
of
lorraine
to
that
dignity
who
announced
his
promotion
by
immediately
commencing
hostilities
against
the
territories
of
strasburg
that
city
now
took
up
arms
in
defence
of
its
protestant
chapter
and
the
prince
of
brandenburg
while
the
other
party
with
the
assistance
of
the
troops
of
lorraine
endeavoured
to
possess
themselves
of
the
temporalities
of
the
chapter
a
tedious
war
was
the
consequence
which
according
to
the
spirit
of
the
times
was
attended
with
barbarous
devastations
in
vain
did
the
emperor
interpose
with
his
supreme
authority
to
terminate
the
dispute
the
ecclesiastical
property
remained
for
a
long
time
divided
between
the
two
parties
till
at
last
the
protestant
prince
for
a
moderate
pecuniary
equivalent
renounced
his
claims
and
thus
in
this
dispute
also
the
roman
church
came
off
victorious
an
occurrence
which
soon
after
the
adjustment
of
this
dispute
took
place
in
donauwerth
a
free
city
of
suabia
was
still
more
critical
for
the
whole
of
protestant
germany
in
this
once
roman
catholic
city
the
protestants
during
the
reigns
of
ferdinand
and
his
son
had
in
the
usual
way
become
so
completely
predominant
that
the
roman
catholics
were
obliged
to
content
themselves
with
a
church
in
the
monastery
of
the
holy
cross
and
for
fear
of
offending
the
protestants
were
even
forced
to
suppress
the
greater
part
of
their
religious
rites
at
length
a
fanatical
abbot
of
this
monastery
ventured
to
defy
the
popular
prejudices
and
to
arrange
a
public
procession
preceded
by
the
cross
and
banners
flying
but
he
was
soon
compelled
to
desist
from
the
attempt
when
a
year
afterwards
encouraged
by
a
favourable
imperial
proclamation
the
same
abbot
attempted
to
renew
this
procession
the
citizens
proceeded
to
open
violence
the
inhabitants
shut
the
gates
against
the
monks
on
their
return
trampled
their
colours
under
foot
and
followed
them
home
with
clamour
and
abuse
an
imperial
citation
was
the
consequence
of
this
act
of
violence
and
as
the
exasperated
populace
even
threatened
to
assault
the
imperial
commissaries
and
all
attempts
at
an
amicable
adjustment
were
frustrated
by
the
fanaticism
of
the
multitude
the
city
was
at
last
formally
placed
under
the
ban
of
the
empire
the
execution
of
which
was
intrusted
to
maximilian
duke
of
bavaria
the
citizens
formerly
so
insolent
were
seized
with
terror
at
the
approach
of
the
bavarian
army
pusillanimity
now
possessed
them
though
once
so
full
of
defiance
and
they
laid
down
their
arms
without
striking
a
blow
the
total
abolition
of
the
protestant
religion
within
the
walls
of
the
city
was
the
punishment
of
their
rebellion
it
was
deprived
of
its
privileges
and
from
a
free
city
of
suabia
converted
into
a
municipal
town
of
bavaria
two
circumstances
connected
with
this
proceeding
must
have
strongly
excited
the
attention
of
the
protestants
even
if
the
interests
of
religion
had
been
less
powerful
on
their
minds
first
of
all
the
sentence
had
been
pronounced
by
the
aulic
council
an
arbitrary
and
exclusively
roman
catholic
tribunal
whose
jurisdiction
besides
had
been
so
warmly
disputed
by
them
and
secondly
its
execution
had
been
intrusted
to
the
duke
of
bavaria
the
head
of
another
circle
these
unconstitutional
steps
seemed
to
be
the
harbingers
of
further
violent
measures
on
the
roman
catholic
side
the
result
probably
of
secret
conferences
and
dangerous
designs
which
might
perhaps
end
in
the
entire
subversion
of
their
religious
liberty
in
circumstances
where
the
law
of
force
prevails
and
security
depends
upon
power
alone
the
weakest
party
is
naturally
the
most
busy
to
place
itself
in
a
posture
of
defence
this
was
now
the
case
in
germany
if
the
roman
catholics
really
meditated
any
evil
against
the
protestants
in
germany
the
probability
was
that
the
blow
would
fall
on
the
south
rather
than
the
north
because
in
lower
germany
the
protestants
were
connected
together
through
a
long
unbroken
tract
of
country
and
could
therefore
easily
combine
for
their
mutual
support
while
those
in
the
south
detached
from
each
other
and
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
roman
catholic
states
were
exposed
to
every
inroad
if
moreover
as
was
to
be
expected
the
catholics
availed
themselves
of
the
divisions
amongst
the
protestants
and
levelled
their
attack
against
one
of
the
religious
parties
it
was
the
calvinists
who
as
the
weaker
and
as
being
besides
excluded
from
the
religious
treaty
were
apparently
in
the
greatest
danger
and
upon
them
would
probably
fall
the
first
attack
both
these
circumstances
took
place
in
the
dominions
of
the
elector
palatine
which
possessed
in
the
duke
of
bavaria
a
formidable
neighbour
and
which
by
reason
of
their
defection
to
calvinism
received
no
protection
from
the
religious
peace
and
had
little
hope
of
succour
from
the
lutheran
states
no
country
in
germany
had
experienced
so
many
revolutions
in
religion
in
so
short
a
time
as
the
palatinate
in
the
space
of
sixty
years
this
country
an
unfortunate
toy
in
the
hands
of
its
rulers
had
twice
adopted
the
doctrines
of
luther
and
twice
relinquished
them
for
calvinism
the
elector
frederick
iii
first
abandoned
the
confession
of
augsburg
which
his
eldest
son
and
successor
lewis
immediately
the
calvinists
throughout
the
whole
country
were
deprived
of
their
churches
their
preachers
and
even
their
teachers
banished
beyond
the
frontiers
while
the
prince
in
his
lutheran
zeal
persecuted
them
even
in
his
will
by
appointing
none
but
strict
and
orthodox
lutherans
as
the
guardians
of
his
son
a
minor
but
this
illegal
testament
was
disregarded
by
his
brother
the
count
palatine
john
casimir
who
by
the
regulations
of
the
golden
bull
assumed
the
guardianship
and
administration
of
the
state
calvinistic
teachers
were
given
to
the
elector
frederick
then
only
nine
years
of
age
who
were
ordered
if
necessary
to
drive
the
lutheran
heresy
out
of
the
soul
of
their
pupil
with
blows
if
such
was
the
treatment
of
the
sovereign
that
of
the
subjects
may
be
easily
conceived
it
was
under
this
frederick
that
the
palatine
court
exerted
itself
so
vigorously
to
unite
the
protestant
states
of
germany
in
joint
measures
against
the
house
of
austria
and
if
possible
bring
about
the
formation
of
a
general
confederacy
besides
that
this
court
had
always
been
guided
by
the
counsels
of
france
with
whom
hatred
of
the
house
of
austria
was
the
ruling
principle
a
regard
for
his
own
safety
urged
him
to
secure
in
time
the
doubtful
assistance
of
the
lutherans
against
a
near
and
overwhelming
enemy
great
difficulties
however
opposed
this
union
because
the
lutherans
dislike
of
the
reformed
was
scarcely
less
than
the
common
aversion
of
both
to
the
romanists
an
attempt
was
first
made
to
reconcile
the
two
professions
in
order
to
facilitate
a
political
union
but
all
these
attempts
failed
and
generally
ended
in
both
parties
adhering
the
more
strongly
to
their
respective
opinions
nothing
then
remained
but
to
increase
the
fear
and
the
distrust
of
the
evangelicals
and
in
this
way
to
impress
upon
them
the
necessity
of
this
alliance
the
power
of
the
roman
catholics
and
the
magnitude
of
the
danger
were
exaggerated
accidental
incidents
were
ascribed
to
deliberate
plans
innocent
actions
misrepresented
by
invidious
constructions
and
the
whole
conduct
of
the
professors
of
the
olden
religion
was
interpreted
as
the
result
of
a
and
systematic
plan
which
in
all
probability
they
were
very
far
from
having
concerted
the
diet
of
ratisbon
to
which
the
protestants
had
looked
forward
with
the
hope
of
obtaining
a
renewal
of
the
religious
peace
had
broken
up
without
coming
to
a
decision
and
to
the
former
grievances
of
the
protestant
party
was
now
added
the
late
oppression
of
donauwerth
with
incredible
speed
the
union
so
long
attempted
was
now
brought
to
bear
a
conference
took
place
at
anhausen
in
franconia
at
which
were
present
the
elector
frederick
from
the
palatinate
the
palsgrave
of
neuburg
two
margraves
of
brandenburg
the
margrave
of
baden
and
the
duke
john
frederick
of
wirtemburg
lutherans
as
well
as
calvinists
who
for
themselves
and
their
heirs
entered
into
a
close
confederacy
under
the
title
of
the
evangelical
union
the
purport
of
this
union
was
that
the
allied
princes
should
in
all
matters
relating
to
religion
and
their
civil
rights
support
each
other
with
arms
and
counsel
against
every
aggressor
and
should
all
stand
as
one
man
that
in
case
any
member
of
the
alliance
should
be
attacked
he
should
be
assisted
by
the
rest
with
an
armed
force
that
if
necessary
the
territories
towns
and
castles
of
the
allied
states
should
be
open
to
his
troops
and
that
whatever
conquests
were
made
should
be
divided
among
all
the
confederates
in
proportion
to
the
contingent
furnished
by
each
the
direction
of
the
whole
confederacy
in
time
of
peace
was
conferred
upon
the
elector
palatine
but
with
a
limited
power
to
meet
the
necessary
expenses
subsidies
were
demanded
and
a
common
fund
established
differences
of
religion
betwixt
the
lutherans
and
the
calvinists
were
to
have
no
effect
on
this
alliance
which
was
to
subsist
for
ten
years
every
member
of
the
union
engaged
at
the
same
time
to
procure
new
members
to
it
the
electorate
of
brandenburg
adopted
the
alliance
that
of
saxony
rejected
it
could
not
be
prevailed
upon
to
declare
itself
the
dukes
of
brunswick
and
luneburg
also
hesitated
but
the
three
cities
of
the
empire
strasburg
nuremburg
and
ulm
were
no
unimportant
acquisition
for
the
league
which
was
in
great
want
of
their
money
while
their
example
besides
might
be
followed
by
other
imperial
cities
after
the
formation
of
this
alliance
the
confederate
states
dispirited
and
singly
little
feared
adopted
a
bolder
language
through
prince
christian
of
anhalt
they
laid
their
common
grievances
and
demands
before
the
emperor
among
which
the
principal
were
the
restoration
of
donauwerth
the
abolition
of
the
imperial
court
the
reformation
of
the
emperor
own
administration
and
that
of
his
counsellors
for
these
remonstrances
they
chose
the
moment
when
the
emperor
had
scarcely
recovered
breath
from
the
troubles
in
his
hereditary
dominions
when
he
had
lost
hungary
and
austria
to
matthias
and
had
barely
preserved
his
bohemian
throne
by
the
concession
of
the
letter
of
majesty
and
finally
when
through
the
succession
of
juliers
he
was
already
threatened
with
the
distant
prospect
of
a
new
war
no
wonder
then
that
this
dilatory
prince
was
more
irresolute
than
ever
in
his
decision
and
that
the
confederates
took
up
arms
before
he
could
bethink
himself
the
roman
catholics
regarded
this
confederacy
with
a
jealous
eye
the
union
viewed
them
and
the
emperor
with
the
like
distrust
the
emperor
was
equally
suspicious
of
both
and
thus
on
all
sides
alarm
and
animosity
had
reached
their
climax
and
as
if
to
crown
the
whole
at
this
critical
conjuncture
by
the
death
of
the
duke
john
william
of
juliers
a
highly
disputable
succession
became
vacant
in
the
territories
of
juliers
and
cleves
eight
competitors
laid
claim
to
this
territory
the
indivisibility
of
which
had
been
guaranteed
by
solemn
treaties
and
the
emperor
who
seemed
disposed
to
enter
upon
it
as
a
vacant
fief
might
be
considered
as
the
ninth
four
of
these
the
elector
of
brandenburg
the
count
palatine
of
neuburg
the
count
palatine
of
deux
ponts
and
the
margrave
of
burgau
an
austrian
prince
claimed
it
as
a
female
fief
in
name
of
four
princesses
sisters
of
the
late
duke
two
others
the
elector
of
saxony
of
the
line
of
albert
and
the
duke
of
saxony
of
the
line
of
ernest
laid
claim
to
it
under
a
prior
right
of
reversion
granted
to
them
by
the
emperor
frederick
and
confirmed
to
both
saxon
houses
by
maximilian
i
the
pretensions
of
some
foreign
princes
were
little
regarded
the
best
right
was
perhaps
on
the
side
of
brandenburg
and
neuburg
and
between
the
claims
of
these
two
it
was
not
easy
to
decide
both
courts
as
soon
as
the
succession
was
vacant
proceeded
to
take
possession
brandenburg
beginning
and
neuburg
following
the
example
both
commenced
their
dispute
with
the
pen
and
would
probably
have
ended
it
with
the
sword
but
the
interference
of
the
emperor
by
proceeding
to
bring
the
cause
before
his
own
cognizance
and
during
the
progress
of
the
suit
sequestrating
the
disputed
countries
soon
brought
the
contending
parties
to
an
agreement
in
order
to
avert
the
common
danger
they
agreed
to
govern
the
duchy
conjointly
in
vain
did
the
emperor
prohibit
the
estates
from
doing
homage
to
their
new
masters
in
vain
did
he
send
his
own
relation
the
archduke
leopold
bishop
of
passau
and
strasburg
into
the
territory
of
juliers
in
order
by
his
presence
to
strengthen
the
imperial
party
the
whole
country
with
the
exception
of
juliers
itself
had
submitted
to
the
protestant
princes
and
in
that
capital
the
imperialists
were
besieged
the
dispute
about
the
succession
of
juliers
was
an
important
one
to
the
whole
german
empire
and
also
attracted
the
attention
of
several
european
courts
it
was
not
so
much
the
question
who
was
or
was
not
to
possess
the
duchy
of
juliers
the
real
question
was
which
of
the
two
religious
parties
in
germany
the
roman
catholic
or
the
protestant
was
to
be
strengthened
by
so
important
an
accession
for
which
of
the
two
religions
this
territory
was
to
be
lost
or
won
the
question
in
short
was
whether
austria
was
to
be
allowed
to
persevere
in
her
usurpations
and
to
gratify
her
lust
of
dominion
by
another
robbery
or
whether
the
liberties
of
germany
and
the
balance
of
power
were
to
be
maintained
against
her
encroachments
the
disputed
succession
of
juliers
therefore
was
matter
which
interested
all
who
were
favourable
to
liberty
and
hostile
to
austria
the
evangelical
union
holland
england
and
particularly
henry
iv
of
france
were
drawn
into
the
strife
this
monarch
the
flower
of
whose
life
had
been
spent
in
opposing
the
house
of
austria
and
spain
and
by
persevering
heroism
alone
had
surmounted
the
obstacles
which
this
house
had
thrown
between
him
and
the
french
throne
had
been
no
idle
spectator
of
the
troubles
in
germany
this
contest
of
the
estates
with
the
emperor
was
the
means
of
giving
and
securing
peace
to
france
the
protestants
and
the
turks
were
the
two
salutary
weights
which
kept
down
the
austrian
power
in
the
east
and
west
but
it
would
rise
again
in
all
its
terrors
if
once
it
were
allowed
to
remove
this
pressure
henry
the
fourth
had
before
his
eyes
for
half
a
lifetime
the
uninterrupted
spectacle
of
austrian
ambition
and
austrian
lust
of
dominion
which
neither
adversity
nor
poverty
of
talents
though
generally
they
check
all
human
passions
could
extinguish
in
a
bosom
wherein
flowed
one
drop
of
the
blood
of
ferdinand
of
arragon
austrian
ambition
had
destroyed
for
a
century
the
peace
of
europe
and
effected
the
most
violent
changes
in
the
heart
of
its
most
considerable
states
it
had
deprived
the
fields
of
husbandmen
the
workshops
of
artisans
to
fill
the
land
with
enormous
armies
and
to
cover
the
commercial
sea
with
hostile
fleets
it
had
imposed
upon
the
princes
of
europe
the
necessity
of
fettering
the
industry
of
their
subjects
by
imposts
and
of
wasting
in
the
best
strength
of
their
states
which
was
thus
lost
to
the
prosperity
of
their
inhabitants
for
europe
there
was
no
peace
for
its
states
no
welfare
for
the
people
happiness
no
security
or
permanence
so
long
as
this
dangerous
house
was
permitted
to
disturb
at
pleasure
the
repose
of
the
world
such
considerations
clouded
the
mind
of
henry
at
the
close
of
his
glorious
career
what
had
it
not
cost
him
to
reduce
to
order
the
troubled
chaos
into
which
france
had
been
plunged
by
the
tumult
of
civil
war
fomented
and
supported
by
this
very
austria
every
great
mind
labours
for
eternity
and
what
security
had
henry
for
the
endurance
of
that
prosperity
which
he
had
gained
for
france
so
long
as
austria
and
spain
formed
a
single
power
which
did
indeed
lie
exhausted
for
the
present
but
which
required
only
one
lucky
chance
to
be
speedily
and
to
spring
up
again
as
formidable
as
ever
if
he
would
bequeath
to
his
successors
a
firmly
established
throne
and
a
durable
prosperity
to
his
subjects
this
dangerous
power
must
be
for
ever
disarmed
this
was
the
source
of
that
irreconcileable
enmity
which
henry
had
sworn
to
the
house
of
austria
a
hatred
unextinguishable
ardent
and
as
that
of
hannibal
against
the
people
of
romulus
but
ennobled
by
a
purer
origin
the
other
european
powers
had
the
same
inducements
to
action
as
henry
but
all
of
them
had
not
that
enlightened
policy
nor
that
disinterested
courage
to
act
upon
the
impulse
all
men
without
distinction
are
allured
by
immediate
advantages
great
minds
alone
are
excited
by
distant
good
so
long
as
wisdom
in
its
projects
calculates
upon
wisdom
or
relies
upon
its
own
strength
it
forms
none
but
chimerical
schemes
and
runs
a
risk
of
making
itself
the
laughter
of
the
world
but
it
is
certain
of
success
and
may
reckon
upon
aid
and
admiration
when
it
finds
a
place
in
its
intellectual
plans
for
barbarism
rapacity
and
superstition
and
can
render
the
selfish
passions
of
mankind
the
executors
of
its
purposes
in
the
first
point
of
view
henry
project
of
expelling
the
house
of
austria
from
all
its
possessions
and
dividing
the
spoil
among
the
european
powers
deserves
the
title
of
a
chimera
which
men
have
so
liberally
bestowed
upon
it
but
did
it
merit
that
appellation
in
the
second
it
had
never
entered
into
the
head
of
that
excellent
monarch
in
the
choice
of
those
who
must
be
the
instruments
of
his
designs
to
reckon
on
the
sufficiency
of
such
motives
as
animated
himself
and
sully
to
the
enterprise
all
the
states
whose
was
necessary
were
to
be
persuaded
to
the
work
by
the
strongest
motives
that
can
set
a
political
power
in
action
from
the
protestants
in
germany
nothing
more
was
required
than
that
which
on
other
grounds
had
been
long
their
object
their
throwing
off
the
austrian
yoke
from
the
flemings
a
similar
revolt
from
the
spaniards
to
the
pope
and
all
the
italian
republics
no
inducement
could
be
more
powerful
than
the
hope
of
driving
the
spaniards
for
ever
from
their
peninsula
for
england
nothing
more
desirable
than
a
revolution
which
should
free
it
from
its
bitterest
enemy
by
this
division
of
the
austrian
conquests
every
power
gained
either
land
or
freedom
new
possessions
or
security
for
the
old
and
as
all
gained
the
balance
of
power
remained
undisturbed
france
might
magnanimously
decline
a
share
in
the
spoil
because
by
the
ruin
of
austria
it
doubly
profited
and
was
most
powerful
if
it
did
not
become
more
powerful
finally
upon
condition
of
ridding
europe
of
their
presence
the
posterity
of
hapsburg
were
to
be
allowed
the
liberty
of
augmenting
her
territories
in
all
the
other
known
or
yet
undiscovered
portions
of
the
globe
but
the
dagger
of
ravaillac
delivered
austria
from
her
danger
to
postpone
for
some
centuries
longer
the
tranquillity
of
europe
with
his
view
directed
to
this
project
henry
felt
the
necessity
of
taking
a
prompt
and
active
part
in
the
important
events
of
the
evangelical
union
and
the
disputed
succession
of
juliers
his
emissaries
were
busy
in
all
the
courts
of
germany
and
the
little
which
they
published
or
allowed
to
escape
of
the
great
political
secrets
of
their
master
was
sufficient
to
win
over
minds
inflamed
by
so
ardent
a
hatred
to
austria
and
by
so
strong
a
desire
of
aggrandizement
the
prudent
policy
of
henry
cemented
the
union
still
more
closely
and
the
powerful
aid
which
he
bound
himself
to
furnish
raised
the
courage
of
the
confederates
into
the
firmest
confidence
a
numerous
french
army
led
by
the
king
in
person
was
to
meet
the
troops
of
the
union
on
the
banks
of
the
rhine
and
to
assist
in
effecting
the
conquest
of
juliers
and
cleves
then
in
conjunction
with
the
germans
it
was
to
march
into
italy
where
savoy
venice
and
the
pope
were
even
now
ready
with
a
powerful
reinforcement
and
to
overthrow
the
spanish
dominion
in
that
quarter
this
victorious
army
was
then
to
penetrate
by
lombardy
into
the
hereditary
dominions
of
hapsburg
and
there
favoured
by
a
general
insurrection
of
the
protestants
destroy
the
power
of
austria
in
all
its
german
territories
in
bohemia
hungary
and
transylvania
the
brabanters
and
hollanders
supported
by
french
auxiliaries
would
in
the
meantime
shake
off
the
spanish
tyranny
in
the
netherlands
and
thus
the
mighty
stream
which
only
a
short
time
before
had
so
fearfully
overflowed
its
banks
threatening
to
overwhelm
in
its
troubled
waters
the
liberties
of
europe
would
then
roll
silent
and
forgotten
behind
the
pyrenean
mountains
at
other
times
the
french
had
boasted
of
their
rapidity
of
action
but
upon
this
occasion
they
were
outstripped
by
the
germans
an
army
of
the
confederates
entered
alsace
before
henry
made
his
appearance
there
and
an
austrian
army
which
the
bishop
of
strasburg
and
passau
had
assembled
in
that
quarter
for
an
expedition
against
juliers
was
dispersed
henry
iv
had
formed
his
plan
as
a
statesman
and
a
king
but
he
had
intrusted
its
execution
to
plunderers
according
to
his
design
no
roman
catholic
state
was
to
have
cause
to
think
this
preparation
aimed
against
itself
or
to
make
the
quarrel
of
austria
its
own
religion
was
in
nowise
to
be
mixed
up
with
the
matter
but
how
could
the
german
princes
forget
their
own
purposes
in
furthering
the
plans
of
henry
actuated
as
they
were
by
the
desire
of
aggrandizement
and
by
religious
hatred
was
it
to
be
supposed
that
they
would
not
gratify
in
every
passing
opportunity
their
ruling
passions
to
the
utmost
like
vultures
they
stooped
upon
the
territories
of
the
ecclesiastical
princes
and
always
chose
those
rich
countries
for
their
quarters
though
to
reach
them
they
must
make
ever
so
wide
a
detour
from
their
direct
route
they
levied
contributions
as
in
an
enemy
country
seized
upon
the
revenues
and
exacted
by
violence
what
they
could
not
obtain
of
not
to
leave
the
roman
catholics
in
doubt
as
to
the
true
objects
of
their
expedition
they
announced
openly
and
intelligibly
enough
the
fate
that
awaited
the
property
of
the
church
so
little
had
henry
iv
and
the
german
princes
understood
each
other
in
their
plan
of
operations
so
much
had
the
excellent
king
been
mistaken
in
his
instruments
it
is
an
unfailing
maxim
that
if
policy
enjoins
an
act
of
violence
its
execution
ought
never
to
be
entrusted
to
the
violent
and
that
he
only
ought
to
be
trusted
with
the
violation
of
order
by
whom
order
is
held
sacred
both
the
past
conduct
of
the
union
which
was
condemned
even
by
several
of
the
evangelical
states
and
the
apprehension
of
even
worse
treatment
aroused
the
roman
catholics
to
something
beyond
mere
inactive
indignation
as
to
the
emperor
his
authority
had
sunk
too
low
to
afford
them
any
security
against
such
an
enemy
it
was
their
union
that
rendered
the
confederates
so
formidable
and
so
insolent
and
another
union
must
now
be
opposed
to
them
the
bishop
of
wurtzburg
formed
the
plan
of
the
catholic
union
which
was
distinguished
from
the
evangelical
by
the
title
of
the
league
the
objects
agreed
upon
were
nearly
the
same
as
those
which
constituted
the
groundwork
of
the
union
bishops
formed
its
principal
members
and
at
its
head
was
placed
maximilian
duke
of
bavaria
as
the
only
influential
secular
member
of
the
confederacy
he
was
entrusted
with
far
more
extensive
powers
than
the
protestants
had
committed
to
their
chief
in
addition
to
the
duke
being
the
sole
head
of
the
league
military
power
whereby
their
operations
acquired
a
speed
and
weight
unattainable
by
the
union
they
had
also
the
advantage
that
supplies
flowed
in
much
more
regularly
from
the
rich
prelates
than
the
latter
could
obtain
them
from
the
poor
evangelical
states
without
offering
to
the
emperor
as
the
sovereign
of
a
roman
catholic
state
any
share
in
their
confederacy
without
even
communicating
its
existence
to
him
as
emperor
the
league
arose
at
once
formidable
and
threatening
with
strength
sufficient
to
crush
the
protestant
union
and
to
maintain
itself
under
three
emperors
it
contended
indeed
for
austria
in
so
far
as
it
fought
against
the
protestant
princes
but
austria
herself
had
soon
cause
to
tremble
before
it
the
arms
of
the
union
had
in
the
meantime
been
tolerably
successful
in
juliers
and
in
alsace
juliers
was
closely
blockaded
and
the
whole
bishopric
of
strasburg
was
in
their
power
but
here
their
splendid
achievements
came
to
an
end
no
french
army
appeared
upon
the
rhine
for
he
who
was
to
be
its
leader
he
who
was
the
animating
soul
of
the
whole
enterprize
henry
was
no
more
their
supplies
were
on
the
wane
the
estates
refused
to
grant
new
subsidies
and
the
confederate
free
cities
were
offended
that
their
money
should
be
liberally
but
their
advice
so
sparingly
called
for
especially
were
they
displeased
at
being
put
to
expense
for
the
expedition
against
juliers
which
had
been
expressly
excluded
from
the
affairs
of
the
union
at
the
united
princes
appropriating
to
themselves
large
pensions
out
of
the
common
treasure
and
above
all
at
their
refusing
to
give
any
account
of
its
expenditure
the
union
was
thus
verging
to
its
fall
at
the
moment
when
the
league
started
to
oppose
it
in
the
vigour
of
its
strength
want
of
supplies
disabled
the
confederates
from
any
longer
keeping
the
field
and
yet
it
was
dangerous
to
lay
down
their
weapons
in
the
sight
of
an
armed
enemy
to
secure
themselves
at
least
on
one
side
they
hastened
to
conclude
a
peace
with
their
old
enemy
the
archduke
leopold
and
both
parties
agreed
to
withdraw
their
troops
from
alsace
to
exchange
prisoners
and
to
bury
all
that
had
been
done
in
oblivion
thus
ended
in
nothing
all
these
promising
preparations
the
same
imperious
tone
with
which
the
union
in
the
confidence
of
its
strength
had
menaced
the
roman
catholics
of
germany
was
now
retorted
by
the
league
upon
themselves
and
their
troops
the
traces
of
their
march
were
pointed
out
to
them
and
plainly
branded
with
the
hard
epithets
they
had
deserved
the
chapters
of
wurtzburg
bamberg
strasburg
mentz
treves
cologne
and
several
others
had
experienced
their
destructive
presence
to
all
these
the
damage
done
was
to
be
made
good
the
free
passage
by
land
and
by
water
restored
for
the
protestants
had
even
seized
on
the
navigation
of
the
rhine
and
everything
replaced
on
its
former
footing
above
all
the
parties
to
the
union
were
called
on
to
declare
expressly
and
unequivocally
its
intentions
it
was
now
their
turn
to
yield
to
superior
strength
they
had
not
calculated
on
so
formidable
an
opponent
but
they
themselves
had
taught
the
roman
catholics
the
secret
of
their
strength
it
was
humiliating
to
their
pride
to
sue
for
peace
but
they
might
think
themselves
fortunate
in
obtaining
it
the
one
party
promised
restitution
the
other
forgiveness
all
laid
down
their
arms
the
storm
of
war
once
more
rolled
by
and
a
temporary
calm
succeeded
the
insurrection
in
bohemia
then
broke
out
which
deprived
the
emperor
of
the
last
of
his
hereditary
dominions
but
in
this
dispute
neither
the
union
nor
the
league
took
any
share
at
length
the
emperor
died
in
as
little
regretted
in
his
coffin
as
noticed
on
the
throne
long
afterwards
when
the
miseries
of
succeeding
reigns
had
made
the
misfortunes
of
his
reign
forgotten
a
halo
spread
about
his
memory
and
so
fearful
a
night
set
in
upon
germany
that
with
tears
of
blood
people
prayed
for
the
return
of
such
an
emperor
rodolph
never
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
choose
a
successor
in
the
empire
and
all
awaited
with
anxiety
the
approaching
vacancy
of
the
throne
but
beyond
all
hope
matthias
at
once
ascended
it
and
without
opposition
the
roman
catholics
gave
him
their
voices
because
they
hoped
the
best
from
his
vigour
and
activity
the
protestants
gave
him
theirs
because
they
hoped
every
thing
from
his
weakness
it
is
not
difficult
to
reconcile
this
contradiction
the
one
relied
on
what
he
had
once
appeared
the
other
judged
him
by
what
he
seemed
at
present
the
moment
of
a
new
accession
is
always
a
day
of
hope
and
the
first
diet
of
a
king
in
elective
monarchies
is
usually
his
severest
trial
every
old
grievance
is
brought
forward
and
new
ones
are
sought
out
that
they
may
be
included
in
the
expected
reform
quite
a
new
world
is
expected
to
commence
with
the
new
reign
the
important
services
which
in
his
insurrection
their
religious
confederates
in
austria
had
rendered
to
matthias
were
still
fresh
in
the
minds
of
the
protestant
free
cities
and
above
all
the
price
which
they
had
exacted
for
their
services
seemed
now
to
serve
them
also
as
a
model
it
was
by
the
favour
of
the
protestant
estates
in
austria
and
moravia
that
matthias
had
sought
and
really
found
the
way
to
his
brother
throne
but
hurried
on
by
his
ambitious
views
he
never
reflected
that
a
way
was
thus
opened
for
the
states
to
give
laws
to
their
sovereign
this
discovery
soon
awoke
him
from
the
intoxication
of
success
scarcely
had
he
shown
himself
in
triumph
to
his
austrian
subjects
after
his
victorious
expedition
to
bohemia
when
a
humble
petition
awaited
him
which
was
quite
sufficient
to
poison
his
whole
triumph
they
required
before
doing
homage
unlimited
religious
toleration
in
the
cities
and
market
towns
perfect
equality
of
rights
between
roman
catholics
and
protestants
and
a
full
and
equal
admissibility
of
the
latter
to
all
offices
of
state
in
several
places
they
of
themselves
assumed
these
privileges
and
reckoning
on
a
change
of
administration
restored
the
protestant
religion
where
the
late
emperor
had
suppressed
it
matthias
it
is
true
had
not
scrupled
to
make
use
of
the
grievances
of
the
protestants
for
his
own
ends
against
the
emperor
but
it
was
far
from
being
his
intention
to
relieve
them
by
a
firm
and
resolute
tone
he
hoped
to
check
at
once
these
presumptuous
demands
he
spoke
of
his
hereditary
title
to
these
territories
and
would
hear
of
no
stipulations
before
the
act
of
homage
a
like
unconditional
submission
had
been
rendered
by
their
neighbours
the
inhabitants
of
styria
to
the
archduke
ferdinand
who
however
had
soon
reason
to
repent
of
it
warned
by
this
example
the
austrian
states
persisted
in
their
refusal
and
to
avoid
being
compelled
by
force
to
do
homage
their
deputies
after
urging
their
roman
catholic
colleagues
to
a
similar
resistance
immediately
left
the
capital
and
began
to
levy
troops
they
took
steps
to
renew
their
old
alliance
with
hungary
drew
the
protestant
princes
into
their
interests
and
set
themselves
seriously
to
work
to
accomplish
their
object
by
force
of
arms
with
the
more
exorbitant
demands
of
the
hungarians
matthias
had
not
hesitated
to
comply
for
hungary
was
an
elective
monarchy
and
the
republican
constitution
of
the
country
justified
to
himself
their
demands
and
to
the
roman
catholic
world
his
concessions
in
austria
on
the
contrary
his
predecessors
had
exercised
far
higher
prerogatives
which
he
could
not
relinquish
at
the
demand
of
the
estates
without
incurring
the
scorn
of
roman
catholic
europe
the
enmity
of
spain
and
rome
and
the
contempt
of
his
own
roman
catholic
subjects
his
exclusively
romish
council
among
which
the
bishop
of
vienna
melchio
kiesel
had
the
chief
influence
exhorted
him
to
see
all
the
churches
extorted
from
him
by
the
protestants
rather
than
to
concede
one
to
them
as
a
matter
of
right
but
by
ill
luck
this
difficulty
occurred
at
a
time
when
the
emperor
rodolph
was
yet
alive
and
a
spectator
of
this
scene
and
who
might
easily
have
been
tempted
to
employ
against
his
brother
the
same
weapons
which
the
latter
had
successfully
directed
against
him
namely
an
understanding
with
his
rebellious
subjects
to
avoid
this
blow
matthias
willingly
availed
himself
of
the
offer
made
by
moravia
to
act
as
mediator
between
him
and
the
estates
of
austria
representatives
of
both
parties
met
in
vienna
when
the
austrian
deputies
held
language
which
would
have
excited
surprise
even
in
the
english
parliament
the
protestants
they
said
are
determined
to
be
not
worse
treated
in
their
native
country
than
the
handful
of
romanists
by
the
help
of
his
protestant
nobles
had
matthias
reduced
the
emperor
to
submission
where
papists
were
to
be
found
protestant
barons
might
be
counted
the
example
of
rodolph
should
be
a
warning
to
matthias
he
should
take
care
that
he
did
not
lose
the
terrestrial
in
attempting
to
make
conquests
for
the
celestial
as
the
moravian
states
instead
of
using
their
powers
as
mediators
for
the
emperor
advantage
finally
adopted
the
cause
of
their
of
austria
as
the
union
in
germany
came
forward
to
afford
them
its
most
active
support
and
as
matthias
dreaded
reprisals
on
the
part
of
the
emperor
he
was
at
length
compelled
to
make
the
desired
declaration
in
favour
of
the
evangelical
church
this
behaviour
of
the
austrian
estates
towards
their
archduke
was
now
imitated
by
the
protestant
estates
of
the
empire
towards
their
emperor
and
they
promised
themselves
the
same
favourable
results
at
his
first
diet
at
ratisbon
in
when
the
most
pressing
affairs
were
waiting
for
decision
when
a
general
contribution
was
indispensable
for
a
war
against
turkey
and
against
bethlem
gabor
in
transylvania
who
by
turkish
aid
had
forcibly
usurped
the
sovereignty
of
that
land
and
even
threatened
hungary
they
surprised
him
with
an
entirely
new
demand
the
roman
catholic
votes
were
still
the
most
numerous
in
the
diet
and
as
every
thing
was
decided
by
a
plurality
of
voices
the
protestant
party
however
closely
united
were
entirely
without
consideration
the
advantage
of
this
majority
the
roman
catholics
were
now
called
on
to
relinquish
henceforward
no
one
religious
party
was
to
be
permitted
to
dictate
to
the
other
by
means
of
its
invariable
superiority
and
in
truth
if
the
evangelical
religion
was
really
to
be
represented
in
the
diet
it
was
that
it
must
not
be
shut
out
from
the
possibility
of
making
use
of
that
privilege
merely
from
the
constitution
of
the
diet
itself
complaints
of
the
judicial
usurpations
of
the
aulic
council
and
of
the
oppression
of
the
protestants
accompanied
this
demand
and
the
deputies
of
the
estates
were
instructed
to
take
no
part
in
any
general
deliberations
till
a
favourable
answer
should
be
given
on
this
preliminary
point
the
diet
was
torn
asunder
by
this
dangerous
division
which
threatened
to
destroy
for
ever
the
unity
of
its
deliberations
sincerely
as
the
emperor
might
have
wished
after
the
example
of
his
father
maximilian
to
preserve
a
prudent
balance
between
the
two
religions
the
present
conduct
of
the
protestants
seemed
to
leave
him
nothing
but
a
critical
choice
between
the
two
in
his
present
necessities
a
general
contribution
from
the
estates
was
indispensable
to
him
and
yet
he
could
not
conciliate
the
one
party
without
sacrificing
the
support
of
the
other
insecure
as
he
felt
his
situation
to
be
in
his
own
hereditary
dominions
he
could
not
but
tremble
at
the
idea
however
remote
of
an
open
war
with
the
protestants
but
the
eyes
of
the
whole
roman
catholic
world
which
were
attentively
regarding
his
conduct
the
remonstrances
of
the
roman
catholic
estates
and
of
the
courts
of
rome
and
spain
as
little
permitted
him
to
favour
the
protestant
at
the
expense
of
the
romish
religion
so
critical
a
situation
would
have
paralysed
a
greater
mind
than
matthias
and
his
own
prudence
would
scarcely
have
extricated
him
from
his
dilemma
but
the
interests
of
the
roman
catholics
were
closely
interwoven
with
the
imperial
authority
if
they
suffered
this
to
fall
the
ecclesiastical
princes
in
particular
would
be
without
a
bulwark
against
the
attacks
of
the
protestants
now
then
that
they
saw
the
emperor
wavering
they
thought
it
high
time
to
reassure
his
sinking
courage
they
imparted
to
him
the
secret
of
their
league
and
acquainted
him
with
its
whole
constitution
resources
and
power
little
comforting
as
such
a
revelation
must
have
been
to
the
emperor
the
prospect
of
so
powerful
a
support
gave
him
greater
boldness
to
oppose
the
protestants
their
demands
were
rejected
and
the
diet
broke
up
without
coming
to
a
decision
but
matthias
was
the
victim
of
this
dispute
the
protestants
refused
him
their
supplies
and
made
him
alone
suffer
for
the
inflexibility
of
the
roman
catholics
the
turks
however
appeared
willing
to
prolong
the
cessation
of
hostilities
and
bethlem
gabor
was
left
in
peaceable
possession
of
transylvania
the
empire
was
now
free
from
foreign
enemies
and
even
at
home
in
the
midst
of
all
these
fearful
disputes
peace
still
reigned
an
unexpected
accident
had
given
a
singular
turn
to
the
dispute
as
to
the
succession
of
juliers
this
duchy
was
still
ruled
conjointly
by
the
electoral
house
of
brandenburg
and
the
palatine
of
neuburg
and
a
marriage
between
the
prince
of
neuburg
and
a
princess
of
brandenburg
was
to
have
inseparably
united
the
interests
of
the
two
houses
but
the
whole
scheme
was
upset
by
a
box
on
the
ear
which
in
a
drunken
brawl
the
elector
of
brandenburg
unfortunately
inflicted
upon
his
intended
from
this
moment
the
good
understanding
between
the
two
houses
was
at
an
end
the
prince
of
neuburg
embraced
popery
the
hand
of
a
princess
of
bavaria
rewarded
his
apostacy
and
the
strong
support
of
bavaria
and
spain
was
the
natural
result
of
both
to
secure
to
the
palatine
the
exclusive
possession
of
juliers
the
spanish
troops
from
the
netherlands
were
marched
into
the
palatinate
to
rid
himself
of
these
guests
the
elector
of
brandenburg
called
the
flemings
to
his
assistance
whom
he
sought
to
propitiate
by
embracing
the
calvinist
religion
both
spanish
and
dutch
armies
appeared
but
as
it
seemed
only
to
make
conquests
for
themselves
the
neighbouring
war
of
the
netherlands
seemed
now
about
to
be
decided
on
german
ground
and
what
an
inexhaustible
mine
of
combustibles
lay
here
ready
for
it
the
protestants
saw
with
consternation
the
spaniards
establishing
themselves
upon
the
lower
rhine
with
still
greater
anxiety
did
the
roman
catholics
see
the
hollanders
bursting
through
the
frontiers
of
the
empire
it
was
in
the
west
that
the
mine
was
expected
to
explode
which
had
long
been
dug
under
the
whole
of
germany
to
the
west
apprehension
and
anxiety
turned
but
the
spark
which
kindled
the
flame
came
unexpectedly
from
the
east
the
tranquillity
which
rodolph
ii
of
majesty
had
established
in
bohemia
lasted
for
some
time
under
the
administration
of
matthias
till
the
nomination
of
a
new
heir
to
this
kingdom
in
the
person
of
ferdinand
of
gratz
this
prince
whom
we
shall
afterwards
become
better
acquainted
with
under
the
title
of
ferdinand
emperor
of
germany
had
by
the
violent
extirpation
of
the
protestant
religion
within
his
hereditary
dominions
announced
himself
as
an
inexorable
zealot
for
popery
and
was
consequently
looked
upon
by
the
roman
catholic
part
of
bohemia
as
the
future
pillar
of
their
church
the
declining
health
of
the
emperor
brought
on
this
hour
rapidly
and
relying
on
so
powerful
a
supporter
the
bohemian
papists
began
to
treat
the
protestants
with
little
moderation
the
protestant
vassals
of
roman
catholic
nobles
in
particular
experienced
the
harshest
treatment
at
length
several
of
the
former
were
incautious
enough
to
speak
somewhat
loudly
of
their
hopes
and
by
threatening
hints
to
awaken
among
the
protestants
a
suspicion
of
their
future
sovereign
but
this
mistrust
would
never
have
broken
out
into
actual
violence
had
the
roman
catholics
confined
themselves
to
general
expressions
and
not
by
attacks
on
individuals
furnished
the
discontent
of
the
people
with
enterprising
leaders
henry
matthias
count
thurn
not
a
native
of
bohemia
but
proprietor
of
some
estates
in
that
kingdom
had
by
his
zeal
for
the
protestant
cause
and
an
enthusiastic
attachment
to
his
newly
adopted
country
gained
the
entire
confidence
of
the
utraquists
which
opened
him
the
way
to
the
most
important
posts
he
had
fought
with
great
glory
against
the
turks
and
won
by
a
flattering
address
the
hearts
of
the
multitude
of
a
hot
and
impetuous
disposition
which
loved
tumult
because
his
talents
shone
in
it
rash
and
thoughtless
enough
to
undertake
things
which
cold
prudence
and
a
calmer
temper
would
not
have
ventured
upon
unscrupulous
enough
where
the
gratification
of
his
passions
was
concerned
to
sport
with
the
fate
of
thousands
and
at
the
same
time
politic
enough
to
hold
in
such
a
people
as
the
bohemians
then
were
he
had
already
taken
an
active
part
in
the
troubles
under
rodolph
administration
and
the
letter
of
majesty
which
the
states
had
extorted
from
that
emperor
was
chiefly
to
be
laid
to
his
merit
the
court
had
intrusted
to
him
as
burgrave
or
castellan
of
calstein
the
custody
of
the
bohemian
crown
and
of
the
national
charter
but
the
nation
had
placed
in
his
hands
something
far
more
important
itself
with
the
office
of
defender
or
protector
of
the
faith
the
aristocracy
by
which
the
emperor
was
ruled
imprudently
deprived
him
of
this
harmless
guardianship
of
the
dead
to
leave
him
his
full
influence
over
the
living
they
took
from
him
his
office
of
burgrave
or
constable
of
the
castle
which
had
rendered
him
dependent
on
the
court
thereby
opening
his
eyes
to
the
importance
of
the
other
which
remained
and
wounded
his
vanity
which
yet
was
the
thing
that
made
his
ambition
harmless
from
this
moment
he
was
actuated
solely
by
a
desire
of
revenge
and
the
opportunity
of
gratifying
it
was
not
long
wanting
in
the
royal
letter
which
the
bohemians
had
extorted
from
rodolph
as
well
as
in
the
german
religious
treaty
one
material
article
remained
undetermined
all
the
privileges
granted
by
the
latter
to
the
protestants
were
conceived
in
favour
of
the
estates
or
governing
bodies
not
of
the
subjects
for
only
to
those
of
the
ecclesiastical
states
had
a
toleration
and
that
precarious
been
conceded
the
bohemian
letter
of
majesty
in
the
same
manner
spoke
only
of
the
estates
and
imperial
towns
the
magistrates
of
which
had
contrived
to
obtain
equal
privileges
with
the
former
these
alone
were
free
to
erect
churches
and
schools
and
openly
to
celebrate
their
protestant
worship
in
all
other
towns
it
was
left
entirely
to
the
government
to
which
they
belonged
to
determine
the
religion
of
the
inhabitants
the
estates
of
the
empire
had
availed
themselves
of
this
privilege
in
its
fullest
extent
the
secular
indeed
without
opposition
while
the
ecclesiastical
in
whose
case
the
declaration
of
ferdinand
had
limited
this
privilege
disputed
not
without
reason
the
validity
of
that
limitation
what
was
a
disputed
point
in
the
religious
treaty
was
left
still
more
doubtful
in
the
letter
of
majesty
in
the
former
the
construction
was
not
doubtful
but
it
was
a
question
how
far
obedience
might
be
compulsory
in
the
latter
the
interpretation
was
left
to
the
states
the
subjects
of
the
ecclesiastical
estates
in
bohemia
thought
themselves
entitled
to
the
same
rights
which
the
declaration
of
ferdinand
secured
to
the
subjects
of
german
bishops
they
considered
themselves
on
an
equality
with
the
subjects
of
imperial
towns
because
they
looked
upon
the
ecclesiastical
property
as
part
of
the
royal
demesnes
in
the
little
town
of
klostergrab
subject
to
the
archbishop
of
prague
and
in
braunau
which
belonged
to
the
abbot
of
that
monastery
churches
were
founded
by
the
protestants
and
completed
notwithstanding
the
opposition
of
their
superiors
and
the
disapprobation
of
the
emperor
in
the
meantime
the
vigilance
of
the
defenders
had
somewhat
relaxed
and
the
court
thought
it
might
venture
on
a
decisive
step
by
the
emperor
orders
the
church
at
klostergrab
was
pulled
down
that
at
braunau
forcibly
shut
up
and
the
most
turbulent
of
the
citizens
thrown
into
prison
a
general
commotion
among
the
protestants
was
the
consequence
of
this
measure
a
loud
outcry
was
everywhere
raised
at
this
violation
of
the
letter
of
majesty
and
count
thurn
animated
by
revenge
and
particularly
called
upon
by
his
office
of
defender
showed
himself
not
a
little
busy
in
inflaming
the
minds
of
the
people
at
his
instigation
deputies
were
summoned
to
prague
from
every
circle
in
the
empire
to
concert
the
necessary
measures
against
the
common
danger
it
was
resolved
to
petition
the
emperor
to
press
for
the
liberation
of
the
prisoners
the
answer
of
the
emperor
already
offensive
to
the
states
from
its
being
addressed
not
to
them
but
to
his
viceroy
denounced
their
conduct
as
illegal
and
rebellious
justified
what
had
been
done
at
klostergrab
and
braunau
as
the
result
of
an
imperial
mandate
and
contained
some
passages
that
might
be
construed
into
threats
count
thurn
did
not
fail
to
augment
the
unfavourable
impression
which
this
imperial
edict
made
upon
the
assembled
estates
he
pointed
out
to
them
the
danger
in
which
all
who
had
signed
the
petition
were
involved
and
sought
by
working
on
their
resentment
and
fears
to
hurry
them
into
violent
resolutions
to
have
caused
their
immediate
revolt
against
the
emperor
would
have
been
as
yet
too
bold
a
measure
it
was
only
step
by
step
that
he
would
lead
them
on
to
this
unavoidable
result
he
held
it
therefore
advisable
first
to
direct
their
indignation
against
the
emperor
counsellors
and
for
that
purpose
circulated
a
report
that
the
imperial
proclamation
had
been
drawn
up
by
the
government
at
prague
and
only
signed
in
vienna
among
the
imperial
delegates
the
chief
objects
of
the
popular
hatred
were
the
president
of
the
chamber
slawata
and
baron
martinitz
who
had
been
elected
in
place
of
count
thurn
burgrave
of
calstein
both
had
long
before
evinced
pretty
openly
their
hostile
feelings
towards
the
protestants
by
alone
refusing
to
be
present
at
the
sitting
at
which
the
letter
of
majesty
had
been
inserted
in
the
bohemian
constitution
a
threat
was
made
at
the
time
to
make
them
responsible
for
every
violation
of
the
letter
of
majesty
and
from
this
moment
whatever
evil
befell
the
protestants
was
set
down
and
not
without
reason
to
their
account
of
all
the
roman
catholic
nobles
these
two
had
treated
their
protestant
vassals
with
the
greatest
harshness
they
were
accused
of
hunting
them
with
dogs
to
the
mass
and
of
endeavouring
to
drive
them
to
popery
by
a
denial
of
the
rites
of
baptism
marriage
and
burial
against
two
characters
so
unpopular
the
public
indignation
was
easily
excited
and
they
were
marked
out
for
a
sacrifice
to
the
general
indignation
on
the
of
may
the
deputies
appeared
armed
and
in
great
numbers
at
the
royal
palace
and
forced
their
way
into
the
hall
where
the
commissioners
sternberg
martinitz
lobkowitz
and
slawata
were
assembled
in
a
threatening
tone
they
demanded
to
know
from
each
of
them
whether
he
had
taken
any
part
or
had
consented
to
the
imperial
proclamation
sternberg
received
them
with
composure
martinitz
and
slawata
with
defiance
this
decided
their
fate
sternberg
and
lobkowitz
less
hated
and
more
feared
were
led
by
the
arm
out
of
the
room
martinitz
and
slawata
were
seized
dragged
to
a
window
and
precipitated
from
a
height
of
eighty
feet
into
the
castle
trench
their
creature
the
secretary
fabricius
was
thrown
after
them
this
singular
mode
of
execution
naturally
excited
the
surprise
of
civilized
nations
the
bohemians
justified
it
as
a
national
custom
and
saw
nothing
remarkable
in
the
whole
affair
excepting
that
any
one
should
have
got
up
again
safe
and
sound
after
such
a
fall
a
dunghill
on
which
the
imperial
commissioners
chanced
to
be
deposited
had
saved
them
from
injury
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
this
summary
mode
of
proceeding
would
much
increase
the
favour
of
the
parties
with
the
emperor
but
this
was
the
very
position
to
which
count
thurn
wished
to
bring
them
if
from
the
fear
of
uncertain
danger
they
had
permitted
themselves
such
an
act
of
violence
the
certain
expectation
of
punishment
and
the
now
urgent
necessity
of
making
themselves
secure
would
plunge
them
still
deeper
into
guilt
by
this
brutal
act
of
no
room
was
left
for
irresolution
or
repentance
and
it
seemed
as
if
a
single
crime
could
be
absolved
only
by
a
series
of
violences
as
the
deed
itself
could
not
be
undone
nothing
was
left
but
to
disarm
the
hand
of
punishment
thirty
directors
were
appointed
to
organise
a
regular
insurrection
they
seized
upon
all
the
offices
of
state
and
all
the
imperial
revenues
took
into
their
own
service
the
royal
functionaries
and
the
soldiers
and
summoned
the
whole
bohemian
nation
to
avenge
the
common
cause
the
jesuits
whom
the
common
hatred
accused
as
the
instigators
of
every
previous
oppression
were
banished
the
kingdom
and
this
harsh
measure
the
estates
found
it
necessary
to
justify
in
a
formal
manifesto
these
various
steps
were
taken
for
the
preservation
of
the
royal
authority
and
the
laws
the
language
of
all
rebels
till
fortune
has
decided
in
their
favour
the
emotion
which
the
news
of
the
bohemian
insurrection
excited
at
the
imperial
court
was
much
less
lively
than
such
intelligence
deserved
the
emperor
matthias
was
no
longer
the
resolute
spirit
that
formerly
sought
out
his
king
and
master
in
the
very
bosom
of
his
people
and
hurled
him
from
three
thrones
the
confidence
and
courage
which
had
animated
him
in
an
usurpation
deserted
him
in
a
legitimate
the
bohemian
rebels
had
first
taken
up
arms
and
the
nature
of
circumstances
drove
him
to
join
them
but
he
could
not
hope
to
confine
such
a
war
to
bohemia
in
all
the
territories
under
his
dominion
the
protestants
were
united
by
a
dangerous
sympathy
the
common
danger
of
their
religion
might
suddenly
combine
them
all
into
a
formidable
republic
what
could
he
oppose
to
such
an
enemy
if
the
protestant
portion
of
his
subjects
deserted
him
and
would
not
both
parties
exhaust
themselves
in
so
ruinous
a
civil
war
how
much
was
at
stake
if
he
lost
and
if
he
won
whom
else
would
he
destroy
but
his
own
subjects
considerations
such
as
these
inclined
the
emperor
and
his
council
to
concessions
and
pacific
measures
but
it
was
in
this
very
spirit
of
concession
that
as
others
would
have
it
lay
the
origin
of
the
evil
the
archduke
ferdinand
of
gratz
congratulated
the
emperor
upon
an
event
which
would
justify
in
the
eyes
of
all
europe
the
severest
measures
against
the
bohemian
protestants
disobedience
lawlessness
and
insurrection
he
said
went
always
with
protestantism
every
privilege
which
had
been
conceded
to
the
estates
by
himself
and
his
predecessor
had
had
no
other
effect
than
to
raise
their
demands
all
the
measures
of
the
heretics
were
aimed
against
the
imperial
authority
step
by
step
had
they
advanced
from
defiance
to
defiance
up
to
this
last
aggression
in
a
short
time
they
would
assail
all
that
remained
to
be
assailed
in
the
person
of
the
emperor
in
arms
alone
was
there
any
safety
against
such
an
enemy
peace
and
subordination
could
be
only
established
upon
the
ruins
of
their
dangerous
privileges
security
for
the
catholic
belief
was
to
be
found
only
in
the
total
destruction
of
this
sect
uncertain
it
was
true
might
be
the
event
of
the
war
but
inevitable
was
the
ruin
if
it
were
pretermitted
the
confiscation
of
the
lands
of
the
rebels
would
richly
indemnify
them
for
its
expenses
while
the
terror
of
punishment
would
teach
the
other
states
the
wisdom
of
a
prompt
obedience
in
future
were
the
bohemian
protestants
to
blame
if
they
armed
themselves
in
time
against
the
enforcement
of
such
maxims
the
insurrection
in
bohemia
besides
was
directed
only
against
the
successor
of
the
emperor
not
against
himself
who
had
done
nothing
to
justify
the
alarm
of
the
protestants
to
exclude
this
prince
from
the
bohemian
throne
arms
had
before
been
taken
up
under
matthias
though
as
long
as
this
emperor
lived
his
subjects
had
kept
within
the
bounds
of
an
apparent
submission
but
bohemia
was
in
arms
and
unarmed
the
emperor
dared
not
even
offer
them
peace
for
this
purpose
spain
supplied
gold
and
promised
to
send
troops
from
italy
and
the
netherlands
count
bucquoi
a
native
of
the
netherlands
was
named
generalissimo
because
no
native
could
be
trusted
and
count
dampierre
another
foreigner
commanded
under
him
before
the
army
took
the
field
the
emperor
endeavoured
to
bring
about
an
amicable
arrangement
by
the
publication
of
a
manifesto
in
this
he
assured
the
bohemians
that
he
held
sacred
the
letter
of
majesty
that
he
had
not
formed
any
resolutions
inimical
to
their
religion
or
their
privileges
and
that
his
present
preparations
were
forced
upon
him
by
their
own
as
soon
as
the
nation
laid
down
their
arms
he
also
would
disband
his
army
but
this
gracious
letter
failed
of
its
effect
because
the
leaders
of
the
insurrection
contrived
to
hide
from
the
people
the
emperor
good
intentions
instead
of
this
they
circulated
the
most
alarming
reports
from
the
pulpit
and
by
pamphlets
and
terrified
the
deluded
populace
with
threatened
horrors
of
another
saint
bartholomew
that
existed
only
in
their
own
imagination
all
bohemia
with
the
exception
of
three
towns
budweiss
krummau
and
pilsen
took
part
in
this
insurrection
these
three
towns
inhabited
principally
by
roman
catholics
alone
had
the
courage
in
this
general
revolt
to
hold
out
for
the
emperor
who
promised
them
assistance
but
it
could
not
escape
count
thurn
how
dangerous
it
was
to
leave
in
hostile
hands
three
places
of
such
importance
which
would
at
all
times
keep
open
for
the
imperial
troops
an
entrance
into
the
kingdom
with
prompt
determination
he
appeared
before
budweiss
and
krummau
in
the
hope
of
terrifying
them
into
a
surrender
krummau
surrendered
but
all
his
attacks
were
steadfastly
repulsed
by
budweiss
and
now
too
the
emperor
began
to
show
more
earnestness
and
energy
bucquoi
and
dampierre
with
two
armies
fell
upon
the
bohemian
territories
which
they
treated
as
a
hostile
country
but
the
imperial
generals
found
the
march
to
prague
more
difficult
than
they
had
expected
every
pass
every
position
that
was
the
least
tenable
must
be
opened
by
the
sword
and
resistance
increased
at
each
fresh
step
they
took
for
the
outrages
of
their
troops
chiefly
consisting
of
hungarians
and
walloons
drove
their
friends
to
revolt
and
their
enemies
to
despair
but
even
now
that
his
troops
had
penetrated
into
bohemia
the
emperor
continued
to
offer
the
estates
peace
and
to
show
himself
ready
for
an
amicable
adjustment
but
the
new
prospects
which
opened
upon
them
raised
the
courage
of
the
revolters
moravia
espoused
their
party
and
from
germany
appeared
to
them
a
defender
equally
intrepid
and
unexpected
in
the
person
of
count
mansfeld
the
heads
of
the
evangelic
union
had
been
silent
but
not
inactive
spectators
of
the
movements
in
bohemia
both
were
contending
for
the
same
cause
and
against
the
same
enemy
in
the
fate
of
the
bohemians
their
confederates
in
the
faith
might
read
their
own
and
the
cause
of
this
people
was
represented
as
of
solemn
concern
to
the
whole
german
union
true
to
these
principles
the
unionists
supported
the
courage
of
the
insurgents
by
promises
of
assistance
and
a
fortunate
accident
now
enabled
them
beyond
their
hopes
to
fulfil
them
the
instrument
by
which
the
house
of
austria
was
humbled
in
germany
was
peter
ernest
count
mansfeld
the
son
of
a
distinguished
austrian
officer
ernest
von
mansfeld
who
for
some
time
had
commanded
with
repute
the
spanish
army
in
the
netherlands
his
first
campaigns
in
juliers
and
alsace
had
been
made
in
the
service
of
this
house
and
under
the
banner
of
the
archduke
leopold
against
the
protestant
religion
and
the
liberties
of
germany
but
insensibly
won
by
the
principles
of
this
religion
he
abandoned
a
leader
whose
selfishness
denied
him
the
reimbursement
of
the
monies
expended
in
his
cause
and
he
transferred
his
zeal
and
a
victorious
sword
to
the
evangelic
union
it
happened
just
then
that
the
duke
of
savoy
an
ally
of
the
union
demanded
assistance
in
a
war
against
spain
they
assigned
to
him
their
newly
acquired
servant
and
mansfeld
received
instructions
to
raise
an
army
of
men
in
germany
in
the
cause
and
in
the
pay
of
the
duke
the
army
was
ready
to
march
at
the
very
moment
when
the
flames
of
war
burst
out
in
bohemia
and
the
duke
who
at
the
time
did
not
stand
in
need
of
its
services
placed
it
at
the
disposal
of
the
union
nothing
could
be
more
welcome
to
these
troops
than
the
prospect
of
aiding
their
confederates
in
bohemia
at
the
cost
of
a
third
party
mansfeld
received
orders
forthwith
to
march
with
these
men
into
that
kingdom
and
a
pretended
bohemian
commission
was
given
to
blind
the
public
as
to
the
true
author
of
this
levy
this
mansfeld
now
appeared
in
bohemia
and
by
the
occupation
of
pilsen
strongly
fortified
and
favourable
to
the
emperor
obtained
a
firm
footing
in
the
country
the
courage
of
the
rebels
was
farther
increased
by
succours
which
the
silesian
states
despatched
to
their
assistance
between
these
and
the
imperialists
several
battles
were
fought
far
indeed
from
decisive
but
only
on
that
account
the
more
destructive
which
served
as
the
prelude
to
a
more
serious
war
to
check
the
vigour
of
his
military
operations
a
negotiation
was
entered
into
with
the
emperor
and
a
disposition
was
shown
to
accept
the
proffered
mediation
of
saxony
but
before
the
event
could
prove
how
little
sincerity
there
was
in
these
proposals
the
emperor
was
removed
from
the
scene
by
death
what
now
had
matthias
done
to
justify
the
expectations
which
he
had
excited
by
the
overthrow
of
his
predecessor
was
it
worth
while
to
ascend
a
brother
throne
through
guilt
and
then
maintain
it
with
so
little
dignity
and
leave
it
with
so
little
renown
as
long
as
matthias
sat
on
the
throne
he
had
to
atone
for
the
imprudence
by
which
he
had
gained
it
to
enjoy
the
regal
dignity
a
few
years
sooner
he
had
shackled
the
free
exercise
of
its
prerogatives
the
slender
portion
of
independence
left
him
by
the
growing
power
of
the
estates
was
still
farther
lessened
by
the
encroachments
of
his
relations
sickly
and
childless
he
saw
the
attention
of
the
world
turned
to
an
ambitious
heir
who
was
impatiently
anticipating
his
fate
and
who
by
his
interference
with
the
closing
administration
was
already
opening
his
own
with
matthias
the
reigning
line
of
the
german
house
of
austria
was
in
a
manner
extinct
for
of
all
the
sons
of
maximilian
one
only
was
now
alive
the
weak
and
childless
archduke
albert
in
the
netherlands
who
had
already
renounced
his
claims
to
the
inheritance
in
favour
of
the
line
of
gratz
the
spanish
house
had
also
in
a
secret
bond
resigned
its
pretensions
to
the
austrian
possessions
in
behalf
of
the
archduke
ferdinand
of
styria
in
whom
the
branch
of
hapsburg
was
about
to
put
forth
new
shoots
and
the
former
greatness
of
austria
to
experience
a
revival
the
father
of
ferdinand
was
the
archduke
charles
of
carniola
carinthia
and
styria
the
youngest
brother
of
the
emperor
maximilian
ii
his
mother
a
princess
of
bavaria
having
lost
his
father
at
twelve
years
of
age
he
was
intrusted
by
the
archduchess
to
the
guardianship
of
her
brother
william
duke
of
bavaria
under
whose
eyes
he
was
instructed
and
educated
by
jesuits
at
the
academy
of
ingolstadt
what
principles
he
was
likely
to
imbibe
by
his
intercourse
with
a
prince
who
from
motives
of
devotion
had
abdicated
his
government
may
be
easily
conceived
care
was
taken
to
point
out
to
him
on
the
one
hand
the
weak
indulgence
of
maximilian
house
towards
the
adherents
of
the
new
doctrines
and
the
consequent
troubles
of
their
dominions
on
the
other
the
blessings
of
bavaria
and
the
inflexible
religious
zeal
of
its
rulers
between
these
two
examples
he
was
left
to
choose
for
himself
formed
in
this
school
to
be
a
stout
champion
of
the
faith
and
a
prompt
instrument
of
the
church
he
left
bavaria
after
a
residence
of
five
years
to
assume
the
government
of
his
hereditary
dominions
the
estates
of
carniola
carinthia
and
styria
who
before
doing
homage
demanded
a
guarantee
for
freedom
of
religion
were
told
that
religious
liberty
has
nothing
to
do
with
their
allegiance
the
oath
was
put
to
them
without
conditions
and
unconditionally
taken
many
years
however
elapsed
ere
the
designs
which
had
been
planned
at
ingolstadt
were
ripe
for
execution
before
attempting
to
carry
them
into
effect
he
sought
in
person
at
loretto
the
favour
of
the
virgin
and
received
the
apostolic
benediction
in
rome
at
the
feet
of
clement
viii
these
designs
were
nothing
less
than
the
expulsion
of
protestantism
from
a
country
where
it
had
the
advantage
of
numbers
and
had
been
legally
recognized
by
a
formal
act
of
toleration
granted
by
his
father
to
the
noble
and
knightly
estates
of
the
land
a
grant
so
formally
ratified
could
not
be
revoked
without
danger
but
no
difficulties
could
deter
the
pious
pupil
of
the
jesuits
the
example
of
other
states
both
roman
catholic
and
protestant
which
within
their
own
territories
had
exercised
unquestioned
a
right
of
reformation
and
the
abuse
which
the
estates
of
styria
made
of
their
religious
liberties
would
serve
as
a
justification
of
this
violent
procedure
under
the
shelter
of
an
absurd
positive
law
those
of
equity
and
prudence
might
it
was
thought
be
safely
despised
in
the
execution
of
these
unrighteous
designs
ferdinand
did
it
must
be
owned
display
no
common
courage
and
perseverance
without
tumult
and
we
may
add
without
cruelty
he
suppressed
the
protestant
service
in
one
town
after
another
and
in
a
few
years
to
the
astonishment
of
germany
this
dangerous
work
was
brought
to
a
successful
end
but
while
the
roman
catholics
admired
him
as
a
hero
and
the
champion
of
the
church
the
protestants
began
to
combine
against
him
as
against
their
most
dangerous
enemy
and
yet
matthias
intention
to
bequeath
to
him
the
succession
met
with
little
or
no
opposition
in
the
elective
states
of
austria
even
the
bohemians
agreed
to
receive
him
as
their
future
king
on
very
favourable
conditions
it
was
not
until
afterwards
when
they
had
experienced
the
pernicious
influence
of
his
councils
on
the
administration
of
the
emperor
that
their
anxiety
was
first
excited
and
then
several
projects
in
his
handwriting
which
an
unlucky
chance
threw
into
their
hands
as
they
plainly
evinced
his
disposition
towards
them
carried
their
apprehension
to
the
utmost
pitch
in
particular
they
were
alarmed
by
a
secret
family
compact
with
spain
by
which
in
default
of
of
his
own
body
ferdinand
bequeathed
to
that
crown
the
kingdom
of
bohemia
without
first
consulting
the
wishes
of
that
nation
and
without
regard
to
its
right
of
free
election
the
many
enemies
too
which
by
his
reforms
in
styria
that
prince
had
provoked
among
the
protestants
were
very
prejudicial
to
his
interests
in
bohemia
and
some
styrian
emigrants
who
had
taken
refuge
there
bringing
with
them
into
their
adopted
country
hearts
overflowing
with
a
desire
of
revenge
were
particularly
active
in
exciting
the
flame
of
revolt
thus
did
ferdinand
find
the
bohemians
when
he
succeeded
matthias
so
bad
an
understanding
between
the
nation
and
the
candidate
for
the
throne
would
have
raised
a
storm
even
in
the
most
peaceable
succession
how
much
more
so
at
the
present
moment
before
the
ardour
of
insurrection
had
cooled
when
the
nation
had
just
recovered
its
dignity
and
reasserted
its
rights
when
they
still
held
arms
in
their
hands
and
the
consciousness
of
unity
had
awakened
an
enthusiastic
reliance
on
their
own
strength
when
by
past
success
by
the
promises
of
foreign
assistance
and
by
visionary
expectations
of
the
future
their
courage
had
been
raised
to
an
undoubting
confidence
disregarding
the
rights
already
conferred
on
ferdinand
the
estates
declared
the
throne
vacant
and
their
right
of
election
entirely
unfettered
all
hopes
of
their
peaceful
submission
were
at
an
end
and
if
ferdinand
wished
still
to
wear
the
crown
of
bohemia
he
must
choose
between
purchasing
it
at
the
sacrifice
of
all
that
would
make
a
crown
desirable
or
winning
it
sword
in
hand
but
with
what
means
was
it
to
be
won
turn
his
eyes
where
he
would
the
fire
of
revolt
was
burning
silesia

already
joined

in

moravia
was
on
the
point
of
following
its
example
in
upper

austria
the
spirit
of
liberty
was
awake
as
it
had
been
under
rodolph
and
the
estates
refused
to
do
homage
hungary
was
menaced
with
an
inroad
by
prince
bethlen
gabor
on
the
side
of
transylvania
a
secret
arming
among
the
turks
spread
consternation
among
the
provinces
to
the
eastward
and
to
complete
his
perplexities
the
protestants
also
in
his
hereditary
dominions
stimulated
by
the
general
example
were
again
raising
their
heads
in
that
quarter
their
numbers
were
overwhelming
in
most
places
they
had
possession
of
the
revenues
which
ferdinand
would
need
for
the
maintenance
of

the

still
very
remote
the
moment
which
had
brought
him
every
thing
threatened
also
to
deprive
him
of
all
and
when
he
now
yielding
to
the
stern
law
of
necessity
made
overtures
to
the

all
his

joyful
concurrence
henceforth
there

he
himself
awaited
the

in
his
capital
a
handful
of
soldiers
was
all
he
could
oppose
to
the
enraged
multitude
these
few
were
without

or
provisions
and
therefore
little
to
be
depended
on
vienna
was
unprepared
for
a
long
siege
the
party
of
the
protestants
ready
at
any
moment
to
join
the
bohemians
had
the
preponderance
in
the
city
those
in
the
country
had
already
begun
to
levy
troops
against
him
already
in
imagination
the
protestant
populace
saw
the
emperor
shut
up
in
a
monastery
his
territories
divided
and
his
children
educated
as
protestants
confiding
in
secret
and
surrounded
by
public
enemies
he
saw
the
chasm
every
moment
widening
to
engulf
his
hopes
and
even
himself
the
bohemian
bullets
were
already
falling
upon
the
imperial
palace
when
sixteen
austrian
barons
forcibly
entered
his
chamber
and
inveighing
against
him
with
loud
and
bitter
reproaches
endeavoured
to
force
him
into
a
confederation
with
the
bohemians
one
of
them
seizing
him
by
the
button
of
his
doublet
demanded
in
a
tone
of
menace
ferdinand
wilt
thou
sign
it
who
would
not
be
pardoned
had
he
wavered
in
this
frightful
situation
yet
ferdinand
still
remembered
the
dignity
of
a
roman
emperor
no
alternative
seemed
left
to
him
but
an
immediate
flight
or
submission
laymen
urged
him
to
the
one
priests
to
the
other
if
he
abandoned
the
city
it
would
fall
into
the
enemy
hands
with
vienna
austria
was
lost
with
austria
the
imperial
throne
ferdinand
abandoned
not
his
capital
and
as
little
would
he
hear
of
conditions
the
archduke
is
still
engaged
in
altercation
with
the
deputed
barons
when
all
at
once
a
sound
of
trumpets
is
heard
in
the
palace
square
terror
and
astonishment
take
possession
of
all
present
a
fearful
report
pervades
the
palace
one
deputy
after
another
disappears
many
of
the
nobility
and
the
citizens
hastily
take
refuge
in
the
camp
of
thurn
this
sudden
change
is
effected
by
a
regiment
of
dampierre
cuirassiers
who
at
that
moment
marched
into
the
city
to
defend
the
archduke
a
body
of
infantry
soon
followed
reassured
by
their
appearance
several
of
the
roman
catholic
citizens
and
even
the
students
themselves
take
up
arms
a
report
which
arrived
just
at
the
same
time
from
bohemia
made
his
deliverance
complete
the
flemish
general
bucquoi
had
totally
defeated
count
mansfeld
at
budweiss
and
was
marching
upon
prague
the
bohemians
hastily
broke
up
their
camp
before
vienna
to
protect
their
own
capital
and
now
also
the
passes
were
free
which
the
enemy
had
taken
possession
of
in
order
to
obstruct
ferdinand
progress
to
his
coronation
at
frankfort
if
the
accession
to
the
imperial
throne
was
important
for
the
plans
of
the
king
of
hungary
it
was
of
still
greater
consequence
at
the
present
moment
when
his
nomination
as
emperor
would
afford
the
most
unsuspicious
and
decisive
proof
of
the
dignity
of
his
person
and
of
the
justice
of
his
cause
while
at
the
same
time
it
would
give
him
a
hope
of
support
from
the
empire
but
the
same
cabal
which
opposed
him
in
his
hereditary
dominions
laboured
also
to
counteract
him
in
his
canvass
for
the
imperial
dignity
no
austrian
prince
they
maintained
ought
to
ascend
the
throne
least
of
all
ferdinand
the
bigoted
persecutor
of
their
religion
the
slave
of
spain
and
of
the
jesuits
to
prevent
this
the
crown
had
been
offered
even
during
the
lifetime
of
matthias
to
the
duke
of
bavaria
and
on
his
refusal
to
the
duke
of
savoy
as
some
difficulty
was
experienced
in
settling
with
the
latter
the
conditions
of
acceptance
it
was
sought
at
all
events
to
delay
the
election
till
some
decisive
blow
in
austria
or
bohemia
should
annihilate
all
the
hopes
of
ferdinand
and
incapacitate
him
from
any
competition
for
this
dignity
the
members
of
the
union
left
no
stone
unturned
to
gain
over
from
ferdinand
the
electorate
of
saxony
which
was
bound
to
austrian
interests
they
represented
to
this
court
the
dangers
with
which
the
protestant
religion
and
even
the
constitution
of
the
empire
were
threatened
by
the
principles
of
this
prince
and
his
spanish
alliance
by
the
elevation
of
ferdinand
to
the
imperial
throne
germany
they
further
asserted
would
be
involved
in
the
private
quarrels
of
this
prince
and
bring
upon
itself
the
arms
of
bohemia
but
in
spite
of
all
opposing
influences
the
day
of
election
was
fixed
ferdinand
summoned
to
it
as
lawful
king
of
bohemia
and
his
electoral
vote
after
a
fruitless
resistance
on
the
part
of
the
bohemian
estates
acknowledged
to
be
good
the
votes
of
the
three
ecclesiastical
electorates
were
for
him
saxony
was
favourable
to
him
brandenburg
made
no
opposition
and
a
decided
majority
declared
him
emperor
in
thus
he
saw
the
most
doubtful
of
his
crowns
placed
first
of
all
on
his
head
but
a
few
days
after
he
lost
that
which
he
had
reckoned
among
the
most
certain
of
his
possessions
while
he
was
thus
elected
emperor
in
frankfort
he
was
in
prague
deprived
of
the
bohemian
throne
almost
all
of
his
german
hereditary
dominions
had
in
the
meantime
entered
into
a
formidable
league
with
the
bohemians
whose
insolence
now
exceeded
all
bounds
in
a
general
diet
the
latter
on
the
of
august
proclaimed
the
emperor
an
enemy
to
the
bohemian
religion
and
liberties
who
by
his
pernicious
counsels
had
alienated
from
them
the
affections
of
the
late
emperor
had
furnished
troops
to
oppress
them
had
given
their
country
as
a
prey
to
foreigners
and
finally
in
contravention
of
the
national
rights
had
bequeathed
the
crown
by
a
secret
compact
to
spain
they
therefore
declared
that
he
had
forfeited
whatever
title
he
might
otherwise
have
had
to
the
crown
and
immediately
proceeded
to
a
new
election
as
this
sentence
was
pronounced
by
protestants
their
choice
could
not
well
fall
upon
a
roman
catholic
prince
though
to
save
appearances
some
voices
were
raised
for
bavaria
and
savoy
but
the
violent
religious
animosities
which
divided
the
evangelical
and
the
reformed
parties
among
the
protestants
impeded
for
some
time
the
election
even
of
a
protestant
king
till
at
last
the
address
and
activity
of
the
calvinists
carried
the
day
from
the
numerical
superiority
of
the
lutherans
among
all
the
princes
who
were
competitors
for
this
dignity
the
elector
palatine
frederick
had
the
best
grounded
claims
on
the
confidence
and
gratitude
of
the
bohemians
and
among
them
all
there
was
no
one
in
whose
case
the
private
interests
of
particular
estates
and
the
attachment
of
the
people
seemed
to
be
justified
by
so
many
considerations
of
state
frederick
was
of
a
free
and
lively
spirit
of
great
goodness
of
heart
and
regal
liberality
he
was
the
head
of
the
calvinistic
party
in
germany
the
leader
of
the
union
whose
resources
were
at
his
disposal
a
near
relation
of
the
duke
of
bavaria
and
a
of
the
king
of
great
britain
who
might
lend
him
his
powerful
support
all
these
considerations
were
prominently
and
successfully
brought
forward
by
the
calvinists
and
frederick
was
chosen
king
by
the
assembly
at
prague
amidst
prayers
and
tears
of
joy
the
whole
proceedings
of
the
diet
at
prague
had
been
premeditated
and
frederick
himself
had
taken
too
active
a
share
in
the
matter
to
feel
at
all
surprised
at
the
offer
made
to
him
by
the
bohemians
but
now
the
immediate
glitter
of
this
throne
dazzled
him
and
the
magnitude
both
of
his
elevation
and
his
delinquency
made
his
weak
mind
to
tremble
after
the
usual
manner
of
pusillanimous
spirits
he
sought
to
confirm
himself
in
his
purpose
by
the
opinions
of
others
but
these
opinions
had
no
weight
with
him
when
they
ran
counter
to
his
own
cherished
wishes
saxony
and
bavaria
of
whom
he
sought
advice
all
his
brother
electors
all
who
compared
the
magnitude
of
the
design
with
his
capacities
and
resources
warned
him
of
the
danger
into
which
he
was
about
to
rush
even
king
james
of
england
preferred
to
see
his
deprived
of
this
crown
than
that
the
sacred
majesty
of
kings
should
be
outraged
by
so
dangerous
a
precedent
but
of
what
avail
was
the
voice
of
prudence
against
the
seductive
glitter
of
a
crown
in
the
moment
of
boldest
determination
when
they
are
indignantly
rejecting
the
consecrated
branch
of
a
race
which
had
governed
them
for
two
centuries
a
free
people
throws
itself
into
his
arms
confiding
in
his
courage
they
choose
him
as
their
leader
in
the
dangerous
career
of
glory
and
liberty
to
him
as
to
its
born
champion
an
oppressed
religion
looks
for
shelter
and
support
against
its
persecutors
could
he
have
the
weakness
to
listen
to
his
fears
and
to
betray
the
cause
of
religion
and
liberty
this
religion
proclaims
to
him
its
own
preponderance
and
the
weakness
of
its
rival
of
the
power
of
austria
are
now
in
arms
against
austria
itself
while
a
formidable
confederacy
already
formed
in
transylvania
would
by
a
hostile
attack
further
distract
even
the
weak
remnant
of
its
power
could
inducements
such
as
these
fail
to
awaken
his
ambition
or
such
hopes
to
animate
and
inflame
his
resolution
a
few
moments
of
calm
consideration
would
have
sufficed
to
show
the
danger
of
the
undertaking
and
the
comparative
worthlessness
of
the
prize
but
the
temptation
spoke
to
his
feelings
the
warning
only
to
his
reason
it
was
his
misfortune
that
his
nearest
and
most
influential
counsellors
espoused
the
side
of
his
passions
the
aggrandizement
of
their
master
power
opened
to
the
ambition
and
avarice
of
his
palatine
servants
an
unlimited
field
for
their
gratification
this
anticipated
triumph
of
their
church
kindled
the
ardour
of
the
calvinistic
fanatic
could
a
mind
so
weak
as
that
of
ferdinand
resist
the
delusions
of
his
counsellors
who
exaggerated
his
resources
and
his
strength
as
much
as
they
underrated
those
of
his
enemies
or
the
exhortations
of
his
preachers
who
announced
the
effusions
of
their
fanatical
zeal
as
the
immediate
inspiration
of
heaven
the
dreams
of
astrology
filled
his
mind
with
visionary
hopes
even
love
conspired
with
its
irresistible
fascination
to
complete
the
seduction
had
you

enough
in

accept
the

of

have
you
misgivings

than

frederick
accepted
the
bohemian
crown
the
coronation
was
celebrated
with
unexampled
pomp
at
prague
for
the
nation
displayed
all
its
riches
in
honour
of
its
own
work
silesia
and
moravia
the
adjoining
provinces
to
bohemia
followed
their
example
and
did
homage
to
frederick
the
reformed
faith
was
enthroned
in
all
the
churches
of
the
kingdom
the
rejoicings
were
unbounded
their
attachment
to
their
new
king
bordered
on
adoration
denmark
and
sweden
holland
and
venice
and
several
of
the
dutch
states
acknowledged
him
as
lawful
sovereign
and
frederick
now
prepared
to
maintain
his
new
acquisition
his
principal
hopes
rested
on
prince
bethlen
gabor
of
transylvania
this
formidable
enemy
of
austria
and
of
the
roman
catholic
church
not
content
with
the
principality
which
with
the
assistance
of
the
turks
he
had
wrested
from
his
legitimate
prince
gabriel
bathori
gladly
seized
this
opportunity
of
aggrandizing
himself
at
the
expense
of
austria
which
had
hesitated
to
acknowledge
him
as
sovereign
of
transylvania
an
attack
upon
hungary
and
austria
was
concerted
with
the
bohemian
rebels
and
both
armies
were
to
unite
before
the
capital
meantime
bethlen
gabor
under
the
mask
of
friendship
disguised
the
true
object
of
his
warlike
preparations
artfully
promising
the
emperor
to
lure
the
bohemians
into
the
toils
by
a
pretended
offer
of
assistance
and
to
deliver
up
to
him
alive
the
leaders
of
the
insurrection
all
at
once
however
he
appeared
in
a
hostile
attitude
in
upper
hungary
before
him
went
terror
and
devastation
behind
all
opposition
yielded
and
at
presburg
he
received
the
hungarian
crown
the
emperor
brother
who
governed
in
vienna
trembled
for
the
capital
he
hastily
summoned
general
bucquoi
to
his
assistance
and
the
retreat
of
the
imperialists
drew
the
bohemians
a
second
time
before
the
walls
of
vienna
reinforced
by
twelve
thousand
transylvanians
and
soon
after
joined
by
the
victorious
army
of
bethlen
gabor
they
again
menaced
the
capital
with
assault
all
the
country
round
vienna
was
laid
waste
the
navigation
of
the
danube
closed
all
supplies
cut
off
and
the
horrors
of
famine
were
threatened
ferdinand
hastily
recalled
to
his
capital
by
this
urgent
danger
saw
himself
a
second
time
on
the
brink
of
ruin
but
want
of
provisions
and
the
inclement
weather
finally
compelled
the
bohemians
to
go
into
quarters
a
defeat
in
hungary
recalled
bethlen
gabor
and
thus
once
more
had
fortune
rescued
the
emperor
in
a
few
weeks
the
scene
was
changed
and
by
his
prudence
and
activity
ferdinand
improved
his
position
as
rapidly
as
frederick
by
indolence
and
impolicy
ruined
his
the
estates
of
lower
austria
were
regained
to
their
allegiance
by
a
confirmation
of
their
privileges
and
the
few
who
still
held
out
were
declared
guilty
of
and
high
treason
during
the
election
of
frankfort
he
had
contrived
by
personal
representations
to
win
over
to
his
cause
the
ecclesiastical
electors
and
also
maximilian
duke
of
bavaria
at
munich
the
whole
issue
of
the
war
the
fate
of
frederick
and
the
emperor
were
now
dependent
on
the
part
which
the
union
and
the
league
should
take
in
the
troubles
of
bohemia
it
was
evidently
of
importance
to
all
the
protestants
of
germany
that
the
king
of
bohemia
should
be
supported
while
it
was
equally
the
interest
of
the
roman
catholics
to
prevent
the
ruin
of
the
emperor
if
the
protestants
succeeded
in
bohemia
all
the
roman
catholic
princes
in
germany
might
tremble
for
their
possessions
if
they
failed
the
emperor
would
give
laws
to
protestant
germany
thus
ferdinand
put
the
league
frederick
the
union
in
motion
the
ties
of
relationship
and
a
personal
attachment
to
the
emperor
his
with
whom
he
had
been
educated
at
ingolstadt
zeal
for
the
roman
catholic
religion
which
seemed
to
be
in
the
most
imminent
peril
and
the
suggestions
of
the
jesuits
combined
with
the
suspicious
movements
of
the
union
moved
the
duke
of
bavaria
and
all
the
princes
of
the
league
to
make
the
cause
of
ferdinand
their
own
according
to
the
terms
of
a
treaty
with
the
emperor
which
assured
to
the
duke
of
bavaria
compensation
for
all
the
expenses
of
the
war
or
the
losses
he
might
sustain
maximilian
took
with
full
powers
the
command
of
the
troops
of
the
league
which
were
ordered
to
march
to
the
assistance
of
the
emperor
against
the
bohemian
rebels
the
leaders
of
the
union
instead
of
delaying
by
every
means
this
dangerous
coalition
of
the
league
with
the
emperor
did
every
thing
in
their
power
to
accelerate
it
could
they
they
thought
but
once
drive
the
roman
catholic
league
to
take
an
open
part
in
the
bohemian
war
they
might
reckon
on
similar
measures
from
all
the
members
and
allies
of
the
union
without
some
open
step
taken
by
the
roman
catholics
against
the
union
no
effectual
confederacy
of
the
protestant
powers
was
to
be
looked
for
they
seized
therefore
the
present
emergency
of
the
troubles
in
bohemia
to
demand
from
the
roman
catholics
the
abolition
of
their
past
grievances
and
full
security
for
the
future
exercise
of
their
religion
they
addressed
this
demand
which
was
moreover
couched
in
threatening
language
to
the
duke
of
bavaria
as
the
head
of
the
roman
catholics
and
they
insisted
on
an
immediate
and
categorical
answer
maximilian
might
decide
for
or
against
them
still
their
point
was
gained
his
concession
if
he
yielded
would
deprive
the
roman
catholic
party
of
its
most
powerful
protector
his
refusal
would
arm
the
whole
protestant
party
and
render
inevitable
a
war
in
which
they
hoped
to
be
the
conquerors
maximilian
firmly
attached
to
the
opposite
party
from
so
many
other
considerations
took
the
demands
of
the
union
as
a
formal
declaration
of
hostilities
and
quickened
his
preparations
while
bavaria
and
the
league
were
thus
arming
in
the
emperor
cause
negotiations
for
a
subsidy
were
opened
with
the
spanish
court
all
the
difficulties
with
which
the
indolent
policy
of
that
ministry
met
this
demand
were
happily
surmounted
by
the
imperial
ambassador
at
madrid
count
khevenhuller
in
addition
to
a
subsidy
of
a
million
of
florins
which
from
time
to
time
were
doled
out
by
this
court
an
attack
upon
the
lower
palatinate
from
the
side
of
the
spanish
netherlands
was
at
the
same
time
agreed
upon
during
these
attempts
to
draw
all
the
roman
catholic
powers
into
the
league
every
exertion
was
made
against
the
of
the
protestants
to
this
end
it
was
important
to
alarm
the
elector
of
saxony
and
the
other
evangelical
powers
and
accordingly
the
union
were
diligent
in
propagating
a
rumour
that
the
preparations
of
the
league
had
for
their
object
to
deprive
them
of
the
ecclesiastical
foundations
they
had
secularized
a
written
assurance
to
the
contrary
calmed
the
fears
of
the
duke
of
saxony
whom
moreover
private
jealousy
of
the
palatine
and
the
insinuations
of
his
chaplain
who
was
in
the
pay
of
austria
and
mortification
at
having
been
passed
over
by
the
bohemians
in
the
election
to
the
throne
strongly
inclined
to
the
side
of
austria
the
fanaticism
of
the
lutherans
could
never
forgive
the
reformed
party
for
having
drawn
as
they
expressed
it
so
many
fair
provinces
into
the
gulf
of
calvinism
and
rejecting
the
roman
antichrist
only
to
make
way
for
an
helvetian
one
while
ferdinand
used
every
effort
to
improve
the
unfavourable
situation
of
his
affairs
frederick
was
daily
injuring
his
good
cause
by
his
close
and
questionable
connexion
with
the
prince
of
transylvania
the
open
ally
of
the
porte
he
gave
offence
to
weak
minds
and
a
general
rumour
accused
him
of
furthering
his
own
ambition
at
the
expense
of
christendom
and
arming
the
turks
against
germany
his
inconsiderate
zeal
for
the
calvinistic
scheme
irritated
the
lutherans
of
bohemia
his
attacks
on
incensed
the
papists
of
this
kingdom
against
him
new
and
oppressive
imposts
alienated
the
affections
of
all
his
subjects
the
disappointed
hopes
of
the
bohemian
nobles
cooled
their
zeal
the
absence
of
foreign
succours
abated
their
confidence
instead
of
devoting
himself
with
untiring
energies
to
the
affairs
of
his
kingdom
frederick
wasted
his
time
in
amusements
instead
of
filling
his
treasury
by
a
wise
economy
he
squandered
his
revenues
by
a
needless
theatrical
pomp
and
a
misplaced
munificence
with
a
carelessness
he
did
but
gaze
at
himself
in
his
new
dignity
and
in
the
desire
to
enjoy
his
crown
he
forgot
the
more
pressing
duty
of
securing
it
on
his
head
but
greatly
as
men
had
erred
in
their
opinion
of
him
frederick
himself
had
not
less
miscalculated
his
foreign
resources
most
of
the
members
of
the
union
considered
the
affairs
of
bohemia
as
foreign
to
the
real
object
of
their
confederacy
others
who
were
devoted
to
him
were
overawed
by
fear
of
the
emperor
saxony
and
hesse
darmstadt
had
already
been
gained
over
by
ferdinand
lower

on
which
side
a
powerful
diversion
had
been
looked
for
had
made
its
submission
to
the
emperor
and
bethlen
gabor
had
concluded
a
truce
with
him
by
its
embassies
the
court
of
vienna
had
induced
denmark
to
remain
inactive
and
to
occupy
sweden
in
a
war
with
the
poles
the
republic
of
holland
had
enough
to
do
to
defend
itself
against
the
arms
of
the
spaniards
venice
and

remained
inactive
king
james
of
england
was
overreached
by
the
artifice
of
spain
one
friend
after
another
withdrew
one
hope
vanished
after
another
so
rapidly
in
a
few
months
was
every
thing
changed
in
the
mean
time
the
leaders
of
the
union
assembled
an
army
the
emperor
and
the
league
did
the
same
the
troops
of
the
latter
were
assembled
under
the
banners
of
maximilian
at
donauwerth
those
of
the
union
at
ulm
under
the
margrave
of
anspach
the
decisive
moment
seemed
at
length
to
have
arrived
which
was
to
end
these
long
dissensions
by
a
vigorous
blow
and
irrevocably
to
settle
the
relation
of
the
two
churches
in
germany
anxiously
on
the
stretch
was
the
expectation
of
both
parties
how
great
then
was
their
astonishment
when
suddenly
the
intelligence
of
peace
arrived
and
both
armies
separated
without
striking
a
blow
the
intervention
of
france
effected
this
peace
which
was
equally
acceptable
to
both
parties
the
french
cabinet
no
longer
swayed
by
the
counsels
of
henry
the
great
and
whose
maxims
of
state
were
perhaps
not
applicable
to
the
present
condition
of
that
kingdom
was
now
far
less
alarmed
at
the
preponderance
of
austria
than
of
the
increase
which
would
accrue
to
the
strength
of
the
calvinists
if
the
palatine
house
should
be
able
to
retain
the
throne
of
bohemia
involved
at
the
time
in
a
dangerous
conflict
with
its
own
calvinistic
subjects
it
was
of
the
utmost
importance
to
france
that
the
protestant
faction
in
bohemia
should
be
suppressed
before
the
huguenots
could
copy
their
dangerous
example
in
order
therefore
to
facilitate
the
emperor
operations
against
the
bohemians
she
offered
her
mediation
to
the
union
and
the
league
and
effected
this
unexpected
treaty
of
which
the
main
article
was
that
the
union
should
abandon
all
interference
in
the
affairs
of
bohemia
and
confine
the
aid
which
they
might
afford
to
frederick
the
fifth
to
his
palatine
territories
to
this
disgraceful
treaty
the
union
were
moved
by
the
firmness
of
maximilian
and
the
fear
of
being
pressed
at
once
by
the
troops
of
the
league
and
a
new
imperial
army
which
was
on
its
march
from
the
netherlands
the
whole
force
of
bavaria
and
the
league
was
now
at
the
disposal
of
the
emperor
to
be
employed
against
the
bohemians
who
by
the
pacification
of
ulm
were
abandoned
to
their
fate
with
a
rapid
movement
and
before
a
rumour
of
the
proceedings
at
ulm
could
reach
there
maximilian
appeared
in
upper
austria
when
the
estates
surprised
and
unprepared
for
an
enemy
purchased
the
emperor
pardon
by
an
immediate
and
unconditional
submission
in
lower
austria
the
duke
formed
a
junction
with
the
troops
from
the
low
countries
under
bucquoi
and
without
loss
of
time
the
united
imperial
and
bavarian
forces
amounting
to
men
entered
bohemia
all
the
bohemian
troops
which
were
dispersed
over

austria
and
moravia
were
driven
before

punishment
inflicted

nothing
in

interrupted
the
impetuous
career
of
maximilian
the
bohemian
army
commanded
by
the
brave
prince
christian
of
anhalt
retreated
to
the
neighbourhood
of
prague
where
under
the
walls
of
the
city
maximilian
offered
him
battle
the
wretched
condition
in
which
he
hoped
to
surprise
the
insurgents
justified
the
rapidity
of
the

movements
and
secured

the
victory
frederick

did
not
amount

eight
thousand
of

hungarians

bethlen
gabor
had
despatched
to
his

an
inroad
of

of
saxony
upon

had
cut
off
all
succours
from
that
country
and
from

the
pacification
of

put
an
end
to
all
his
expectations
from
that
quarter
bethlen
gabor
his
most
powerful
ally
remained
inactive
in
transylvania
the
union
had
betrayed
his
cause
to
the
emperor
nothing
remained
to
him
but
his
bohemians
and
they
were
without
goodwill
to
his
cause
and
without
unity
and
courage
the
bohemian
magnates
were
indignant
that
german
generals
should
be
put
over
their
heads
count
mansfeld
remained
in
pilsen
at
a
distance
from
the
camp
to
avoid
the
mortification
of
serving
under
anhalt
and
hohenlohe
the
soldiers
in
want
of
necessaries
became
dispirited
and
the
little
discipline
that
was
observed
gave
occasion
to
bitter
complaints
from
the
peasantry
it
was
in
vain
that
frederick
made
his
appearance
in
the
camp
in
the
hope
of
reviving
the
courage
of
the
soldiers
by
his
presence
and
of
kindling
the
emulation
of
the
nobles
by
his
example
the
bohemians
had
begun
to
entrench
themselves
on
the
white
mountain
near
prague
when
they
were
attacked
by
the
imperial
and
bavarian
armies
on
the
november
in
the
beginning
of
the
action
some
advantages
were
gained
by
the
cavalry
of
the
prince
of
anhalt
but
the
superior
numbers
of
the
enemy
soon
neutralized
them
the
charge
of
the
bavarians
and
walloons
was
irresistible
the
hungarian
cavalry
was
the
first
to
retreat
the
bohemian
infantry
soon
followed
their
example
and
the
germans
were
at
last
carried
along
with
them
in
the
general
flight
ten
cannons
composing
the
whole
of
frederick
artillery
were
taken
by
the
enemy
four
thousand
bohemians
fell
in
the
flight
and
on
the
field
while
of
the
imperialists
and
soldiers
of
the
league
only
a
few
hundred
were
killed
in
less
than
an
hour
this
decisive
action
was
over
frederick
was
seated
at
table
in
prague
while
his
army
was
thus
cut
to
pieces
it
is
probable
that
he
had
not
expected
the
attack
on
this
day
since
he
had
ordered
an
entertainment
for
it
a
messenger
summoned
him
from
table
to
show
him
from
the
walls
the
whole
frightful
scene
he
requested
a
cessation
of
hostilities
for
hours
for
deliberation
but
eight
was
all
the
duke
of
bavaria
would
allow
him
frederick
availed
himself
of
these
to
fly
by
night
from
the
capital
with
his
wife
and
the
chief
officers
of
his
army
this
flight
was
so
hurried
that
the
prince
of
anhalt
left
behind
him
his
most
private
papers
and
frederick
his
crown
i
know
now
what
i
am
said
this
unfortunate
prince
to
those
who
endeavoured
to
comfort
him
there
are
virtues
which
misfortune
only
can
teach
us
and
it
is
in
adversity
alone
that
princes
learn
to
know
themselves
prague
was
not
irretrievably
lost
when
frederick
pusillanimity
abandoned
it
the
light
troops
of
mansfeld
were
still
in
pilsen
and
were
not
engaged
in
the
action
bethlen
gabor
might
at
any
moment
have
assumed
an
offensive
attitude
and
drawn
off
the
emperor
army
to
the
hungarian
frontier
the
defeated
bohemians
might
rally
sickness
famine
and
the
inclement
weather
might
wear
out
the
enemy
but
all
these
hopes
disappeared
before
the
immediate
alarm
frederick
dreaded
the
fickleness
of
the
bohemians
who
might
probably
yield
to
the
temptation
to
purchase
by
the
surrender
of
his
person
the
pardon
of
the
emperor
thurn
and
those
of
this
party
who
were
in
the
same
condemnation
with
him
found
it
equally
inexpedient
to
await
their
destiny
within
the
walls
of
prague
they
retired
towards
moravia
with
a
view
of
seeking
refuge
in
transylvania
frederick
fled
to
breslau
where
however
he
only
remained
a
short
time
he
removed
from
thence
to
the
court
of
the
elector
of
brandenburg
and
finally
took
shelter
in
holland
the
battle
of
prague
had
decided
the
fate
of
bohemia
prague
surrendered
the
next
day
to
the
victors
the
other
towns
followed
the
example
of
the
capital
the
estates
did
homage
without
conditions
and
the
same
was
done
by
those
of
silesia
and
moravia
the
emperor
allowed
three
months
to
elapse
before
instituting
any
inquiry
into
the
past
reassured
by
this
apparent
clemency
many
who
at
first
had
fled
in
terror
appeared
again
in
the
capital
all
at
once
however
the
storm
burst
forth
of
the
most
active
among
the
insurgents
were
arrested
on
the
same
day
and
hour
and
tried
by
an
extraordinary
commission
composed
of
native
bohemians
and
austrians
of
these
and
of
the
common
people
an
immense
number
expired
on
the
scaffold
the
absenting
offenders
were
summoned
to
appear
to
their
trial
and
failing
to
do
so
condemned
to
death
as
traitors
and
offenders
against
his
catholic
majesty
their
estates
confiscated
and
their
names
affixed
to
the
gallows
the
property
also
of
the
rebels
who
had
fallen
in
the
field
was
seized
this
tyranny
might
have
been
borne
as
it
affected
individuals
only
and
while
the
ruin
of
one
enriched
another
but
more
intolerable
was
the
oppression
which
extended
to
the
whole
kingdom
without
exception
all
the
protestant
preachers
were
banished
from
the
country
the
bohemians
first
and
afterwards
those
of
germany
the
of
majesty
ferdinand
tore
with
his
own
hand
and
burnt
the
seal
seven
years
after
the
battle
of
prague
the
toleration
of
the
protestant
religion
within
the
kingdom
was
entirely
revoked
but
whatever
violence
the
emperor
allowed
himself
against
the
religious
privileges
of
his
subjects
he
carefully
abstained
from
interfering
with
their
political
constitution
and
while
he
deprived
them
of
the
liberty
of
thought
he
magnanimously
left
them
the
prerogative
of
taxing
themselves
the
victory
of
the
white
mountain
put
ferdinand
in
possession
of
all
his
dominions
it
even
invested
him
with
greater
authority
over
them
than
his
predecessors
enjoyed
since
their
allegiance
had
been
unconditionally
pledged
to
him
and
no
letter
of
majesty
now
existed
to
limit
his
sovereignty
all
his
wishes
were
now
gratified
to
a
degree
surpassing
his
most
sanguine
expectations
it
was
now
in
his
power
to
dismiss
his
allies
and
disband
his
army
if
he
was
just
there
was
an
end
of
the
war
if
he
was
both
magnanimous
and
just
punishment
was
also
at
an
end
the
fate
of
germany
was
in
his
hands
the
happiness
and
misery
of
millions
depended
on
the
resolution
he
should
take
never
was
so
great
a
decision
resting
on
a
single
mind
never
did
the
blindness
of
one
man
produce
so
much
ruin
book
ii
the
resolution
which
ferdinand
now
adopted
gave
to
the
war
a
new
direction
a
new
scene
and
new
actors
from
a
rebellion
in
bohemia
and
the
chastisement
of
rebels
a
war
extended
first
to
germany
and
afterwards
to
europe
it
is
therefore
necessary
to
take
a
general
survey
of
the
state
of
affairs
both
in
germany
and
the
rest
of
europe
unequally
as
the
territory
of
germany
and
the
privileges
of
its
members
were
divided
among
the
roman
catholics
and
the
protestants
neither
party
could
hope
to
maintain
itself
against
the
encroachments
of
its
adversary
otherwise
than
by
a
prudent
use
of
its
peculiar
advantages
and
by
a
politic
union
among
themselves
if
the
roman
catholics
were
the
more
numerous
party
and
more
favoured
by
the
constitution
of
the
empire
the
protestants
on
the
other
hand
had
the
advantage
of
possessing
a
more
compact
and
populous
line
of
territories
valiant
princes
a
warlike
nobility
numerous
armies
flourishing
free
towns
the
command
of
the
sea
and
even
at
the
worst
certainty
of
support
from
roman
catholic
states
if
the
catholics
could
arm
spain
and
italy
in
their
favour
the
republics
of
venice
holland
and
england
opened
their
treasures
to
the
protestants
while
the
states
of
the
north
and
the
formidable
power
of
turkey
stood
ready
to
afford
them
prompt
assistance
brandenburg
saxony
and
the
palatinate
opposed
three
protestant
to
three
ecclesiastical
votes
in
the
electoral
college
while
to
the
elector
of
bohemia
as
to
the
archduke
of
austria
the
possession
of
the
imperial
dignity
was
an
important
check
if
the
protestants
properly
availed
themselves
of
it
the
sword
of
the
union
might
keep
within
its
sheath
the
sword
of
the
league
or
if
matters
actually
came
to
a
war
might
make
the
issue
of
it
doubtful
but
unfortunately
private
interests
dissolved
the
band
of
union
which
should
have
held
together
the
protestant
members
of
the
empire
this
critical
conjuncture
found
none
but
actors
on
the
political
stage
and
the
decisive
moment
was
neglected
because
the
courageous
were
deficient
in
power
and
the
powerful
in
sagacity
courage
and
resolution
the
elector
of
saxony
was
placed
at
the
head
of
the
german
protestants
by
the
services
of
his
ancestor
maurice
by
the
extent
of
his
territories
and
by
the
influence
of
his
electoral
vote
upon
the
resolution
he
might
adopt
the
fate
of
the
contending
parties
seemed
to
depend
and
john
george
was
not
insensible
to
the
advantages
which
this
important
situation
procured
him
equally
valuable
as
an
ally
both
to
the
emperor
and
to
the
protestant
union
he
cautiously
avoided
committing
himself
to
either
party
neither
trusting
himself
by
any
irrevocable
declaration
entirely
to
the
gratitude
of
the
emperor
nor
renouncing
the
advantages
which
were
to
be
gained
from
his
fears
uninfected
by
the
contagion
of
religious
and
romantic
enthusiasm
which
hurried
sovereign
after
sovereign
to
risk
both
crown
and
life
on
the
hazard
of
war
john
george
aspired
to
the
more
solid
renown
of
improving
and
advancing
the
interests
of
his
territories
his
cotemporaries
accused
him
of
forsaking
the
protestant
cause
in
the
very
midst
of
the
storm
of
preferring
the
aggrandizement
of
his
house
to
the
emancipation
of
his
country
of
exposing
the
whole
evangelical
or
lutheran
church
of
germany
to
ruin
rather
than
raise
an
arm
in
defence
of
the
reformed
or
calvinists
of
injuring
the
common
cause
by
his
suspicious
friendship
more
seriously
than
the
open
enmity
of
its
avowed
opponents
but
it
would
have
been
well
if
his
accusers
had
imitated
the
wise
policy
of
the
elector
if
despite
of
the
prudent
policy
the
saxons
like
all
others
groaned
at
the
cruelties
which
marked
the
emperor
progress
if
all
germany
was
a
witness
how
ferdinand
deceived
his
confederates
and
trifled
with
his
engagements
if
even
the
elector
himself
at
last
perceived
this
the
more
shame
to
the
emperor
who
could
so
basely
betray
such
implicit
confidence
if
an
excessive
reliance
on
the
emperor
and
the
hope
of
enlarging
his
territories
tied
the
hands
of
the
elector
of
saxony
the
weak
george
william
elector
of
brandenburg
was
still
more
shamefully
fettered
by
fear
of
austria
and
of
the
loss
of
his
dominions
what
was
made
a
reproach
against
these
princes
would
have
preserved
to
the
elector
palatine
his
fame
and
his
kingdom
a
rash
confidence
in
his
untried
strength
the
influence
of
french
counsels
and
the
temptation
of
a
crown
had
seduced
that
unfortunate
prince
into
an
enterprise
for
which
he
had
neither
adequate
genius
nor
political
capacity
the
partition
of
his
territories
among
discordant
princes
enfeebled
the
palatinate
which
united
might
have
made
a
longer
resistance
this
partition
of
territory
was
equally
injurious
to
the
house
of
hesse
in
which
between
darmstadt
and
cassel
religious
dissensions
had
occasioned
a
fatal
division
the
line
of
darmstadt
adhering
to
the
confession
of
augsburg
had
placed
itself
under
the
emperor
protection
who
favoured
it
at
the
expense
of
the
calvinists
of
cassel
while
his
religious
confederates
were
shedding
their
blood
for
their
faith
and
their
liberties
the
landgrave
of
darmstadt
was
won
over
by
the
emperor
gold
but
william
of
cassel
every
way
worthy
of
his
ancestor
who
a
century
before
had
defended
the
freedom
of
germany
against
the
formidable
charles
espoused
the
cause
of
danger
and
of
honour
superior
to
that
pusillanimity
which
made
far
more
powerful
princes
bow
before
ferdinand
might
the
landgrave
william
was
the
first
to
join
the
hero
of
sweden
and
to
set
an
example
to
the
princes
of
germany
which
all
had
hesitated
to
begin
the
boldness
of
his
resolve
was
equalled
by
the
steadfastness
of
his
perseverance
and
the
valour
of
his
exploits
he
placed
himself
with
unshrinking
resolution
before
his
bleeding
country
and
boldly
confronted
the
fearful
enemy
whose
hands
were
still
reeking
from
the
carnage
of
magdeburg
the
landgrave
william
deserves
to
descend
to
immortality
with
the
heroic
race
of
ernest
thy
day
of
vengeance
was
long
delayed
unfortunate
john
frederick
noble
prince
slowly
but
brightly
it
broke
thy
times
returned
and
thy
heroic
spirit
descended
on
thy
grandson
an
intrepid
race
of
princes
issues
from
the
thuringian
forests
to
shame
by
immortal
deeds
the
unjust
sentence
which
robbed
thee
of
the
electoral
crown
to
avenge
thy
offended
shade
by
heaps
of
bloody
sacrifice
the
sentence
of
the
conqueror
could
deprive
thee
of
thy
territories
but
not
that
spirit
of
patriotism
which
staked
them
nor
that
chivalrous
courage
which
a
century
afterwards
was
destined
to
shake
the
throne
of
his
descendant
thy
vengeance
and
that
of
germany
whetted
the
sacred
sword
and
one
heroic
hand
after
the
other
wielded
the
irresistible
steel
as
men
they
achieved
what
as
sovereigns
they
dared
not
undertake
they
met
in
a
glorious
cause
as
the
valiant
soldiers
of
liberty
too
weak
in
territory
to
attack
the
enemy
with
their
own
forces
they
directed
foreign
artillery
against
them
and
led
foreign
banners
to
victory
the
liberties
of
germany
abandoned
by
the
more
powerful
states
who
however
enjoyed
most
of
the
prosperity
accruing
from
them
were
defended
by
a
few
princes
for
whom
they
were
almost
without
value
the
possession
of

and

deadened
courage
the
want

saxony
brandenburg
and
the
rest
drew
back

shedding
their

in
the

the

and
the
free

the

of

a
formidable
one
anxiously
avoided

crouched
murmuring
beneath

which
were

unwarlike
to
resist
the
multitudes
whom
the
prosperity
of
their

allured
became
the
victims
of

to
persecute

they
could

sunk
into
insignificance
by
the
side
of

in
his
hand
alone
their

power
could
be
rendered
available
the
formidable
monarchy
which
charles

had
unnaturally
constructed
of

and
the

and
their

to

this

decline

it
did
agriculture
the

the
dangerous
policy
of

was
as
firm
as
their
belief
in
the
bones
of

external
splendour
concealed
the
inward
wounds
at
which
the
of
this
monarchy
was
oozing

the
belief

survived
because
it
still
maintained
the
lofty
tone
of
its
golden
days
slaves
in
their

strangers
even
upon
their
own

the
spanish
nominal

it
is
very
doubtful

they
afforded
was
worth
the
dependence
by
which
the

purchased
it
the
fate
of
europe
was
decided
behind
the
pyrenees
by
ignorant
monks
or
vindictive
favourites
yet
even
in
its
debasement
a
power
must
always
be
formidable
which
yields
to
none
in
extent
which
from
custom
if
not
from
the
steadfastness
of
its
views
adhered
faithfully
to
one
system
of
policy
which
possessed
armies
and
consummate
generals
which
where
the
sword
failed
did
not
scruple
to
employ
the
dagger
and
converted
even
its
ambassadors
into
incendiaries
and
assassins
what
it
had
lost
in
three
quarters
of
the
globe
it
now
sought
to
regain
to
the
eastward
and
all
europe
was
at
its
mercy
if
it
could
succeed
in
its
long
cherished
design
of
uniting
with
the
hereditary
dominions
of
austria
all
that
lay
between
the
alps
and
the
adriatic
to
the
great
alarm
of
the
native
states
this
formidable
power
had
gained
a
footing
in
italy
where
its
continual
encroachments
made
the
neighbouring
sovereigns
to
tremble
for
their
own
possessions
the
pope
himself
was
in
the
most
dangerous
situation
hemmed
in
on
both
sides
by
the
spanish
viceroys
of
naples
on
the
one
side
and
that
of

upon

was
confined
between
the
austrian
tyrol
and
the
spanish
territories
in
milan
savoy
was
surrounded
by
the

and

hence
the
wavering
and
equivocal
policy
which
from
the
time
of
charles
had
been
pursued
by
the
italian
states
the
double
character
which
pertained
to
the
popes
made
them
perpetually
vacillate
between
two
contradictory
systems
of
policy
if
the
successors
of
peter
found
in
the
spanish
princes
their
most
obedient
disciples
and
the
most
steadfast
supporters
of
the
papal
see
yet
the
princes
of
the
states
of
the
church
had
in
these
monarchs
their
most
dangerous
neighbours
and
most
formidable
opponents
if
in
the
one
capacity
their
dearest
wish
was
the
destruction
of
the
protestants
and
the
triumph
of
austria
in
the
other
they
had
reason
to
bless
the
arms
of
the
protestants
which
disabled
a
dangerous
enemy
the
one
or
the
other
sentiment
prevailed
according
as
the
love
of
temporal
dominion
or
zeal
for
spiritual
supremacy
predominated
in
the
mind
of
the
pope
but
the
policy
of
rome
was
on
the
whole
directed
to
immediate
dangers
and
it
is
well
known
how
far
more
powerful
is
the
apprehension
of
losing
a
present
good
than
anxiety
to
recover
a
long
lost
possession
and
thus
it
becomes
intelligible
how
the
pope
should
first
combine
with
austria
for
the
destruction
of
heresy
and
then
conspire
with
these
very
heretics
for
the
destruction
of
austria
strangely
blended
are
the
threads
of
human
affairs
what
would
have
become
of
the
reformation
and
of
the
liberties
of
germany
if
the
bishop
of
rome
and
the
prince
of
rome
had
had
but
one
interest
france
had
lost
with
its
great
henry
all
its
importance
and
all
its
weight
in
the
political
balance
of
europe
a
turbulent
minority
had
destroyed
all
the
benefits
of
the
able
administration
of
henry
incapable
ministers
the
creatures
of
court
intrigue
squandered
in
a
few
years
the
treasures
which
sully
economy
and
henry
frugality
had
amassed
scarce
able
to
maintain
their
ground
against
internal
factions
they
were
compelled
to
resign
to
other
hands
the
helm
of
european
affairs
the
same
civil
war
which
armed
germany
against
itself
excited
a
similar
commotion
in
france
and
louis
xiii
attained
majority
only
to
wage
a
war
with
his
own
mother
and
his
protestant
subjects
this
party
which
had
been
kept
quiet
by
henry
enlightened
policy
now
seized
the
opportunity
to
take
up
arms
and
under
the
command
of
some
adventurous
leaders
began
to
form
themselves
into
a
party
within
the
state
and
to
fix
on
the
strong
and
powerful
town
of
rochelle
as
the
capital
of
their
intended
kingdom
too
little
of
a
statesman
to
suppress
by
a
prudent
toleration
this
civil
commotion
in
its
birth
and
too
little
master
of
the
resources
of
his
kingdom
to
direct
them
with
energy
louis
xiii
was
reduced
to
the
degradation
of
purchasing
the
submission
of
the
rebels
by
large
sums
of
money
though
policy
might
incline
him
in
one
point
of
view
to
assist
the
bohemian
insurgents
against
austria
the
son
of
henry
the
fourth
was
now
compelled
to
be
an
inactive
spectator
of
their
destruction
happy
enough
if
the
calvinists
in
his
own
dominions
did
not
unseasonably
bethink
them
of
their
confederates
beyond
the
rhine
a
great
mind
at
the
helm
of
state
would
have
reduced
the
protestants
in
france
to
obedience
while
it
employed
them
to
fight
for
the
independence
of
their
german
brethren
but
henry
iv
was
no
more
and
richelieu
had
not
yet
revived
his
system
of
policy
while
the
glory
of
france
was
thus
upon
the
wane
the
emancipated
republic
of
holland
was
completing
the
fabric
of
its
greatness
the
enthusiastic
courage
had
not
yet
died
away
which
enkindled
by
the
house
of
orange
had
converted
this
mercantile
people
into
a
nation
of
heroes
and
had
enabled
them
to
maintain
their
independence
in
a
bloody
war
against
the
spanish
monarchy
aware
how
much
they
owed
their
own
liberty
to
foreign
support
these
republicans
were
ready
to
assist
their
german
brethren
in
a
similar
cause
and
the
more
so
as
both
were
opposed
to
the
same
enemy
and
the
liberty
of
germany
was
the
best
warrant
for
that
of
holland
but
a
republic
which
had
still
to
battle
for
its
very
existence
which
with
all
its
wonderful
exertions
was
scarce
a
match
for
the
formidable
enemy
within
its
own
territories
could
not
be
expected
to
withdraw
its
troops
from
the
necessary
work
of
to
employ
them
with
a
magnanimous
policy
in
protecting
foreign
states
england
too
though
now
united
with
scotland
no
longer
possessed
under
the
weak
james
that
influence
in
the
affairs
of
europe
which
the
governing
mind
of
elizabeth
had
procured
for
it
convinced
that
the
welfare
of
her
dominions
depended
on
the
security
of
the
protestants
this
politic
princess
had
never
swerved
from
the
principle
of
promoting
every
enterprise
which
had
for
its
object
the
diminution
of
the
austrian
power
her
successor
was
no
less
devoid
of
capacity
to
comprehend
than
of
vigour
to
execute
her
views
while
the
economical
elizabeth
spared
not
her
treasures
to
support
the
flemings
against
spain
and
henry
iv
against
the
league
james
abandoned
his
daughter
his
and
his
grandchild
to
the
fury
of
their
enemies
while
he
exhausted
his
learning
to
establish
the
divine
right
of
kings
he
allowed
his
own
dignity
to
sink
into
the
dust
while
he
exerted
his
rhetoric
to
prove
the
absolute
authority
of
kings
he
reminded
the
people
of
theirs
and
by
a
useless
profusion
sacrificed
the
chief
of
his
sovereign
rights
that
of
dispensing
with
his
parliament
and
thus
depriving
liberty
of
its
organ
an
innate
horror
at
the
sight
of
a
naked
sword
averted
him
from
the
most
just
of
wars
while
his
favourite
buckingham
practised
on
his
weakness
and
his
own
complacent
vanity
rendered
him
an
easy
dupe
of
spanish
artifice
while
his
was
ruined
and
the
inheritance
of
his
grandson
given
to
others
this
weak
prince
was
imbibing
with
satisfaction
the
incense
which
was
offered
to
him
by
austria
and
spain
to
divert
his
attention
from
the
german
war
he
was
amused
with
the
proposal
of
a
spanish
marriage
for
his
son
and
the
ridiculous
parent
encouraged
the
romantic
youth
in
the
foolish
project
of
paying
his
addresses
in
person
to
the
spanish
princess
but
his
son
lost
his
bride
as
his
lost
the
crown
of
bohemia
and
the
palatine
electorate
and
death
alone
saved
him
from
the
danger
of
closing
his
pacific
reign
by
a
war
at
home
which
he
never
had
courage
to
maintain
even
at
a
distance
the
domestic
disturbances
which
his
misgovernment
had
gradually
excited
burst
forth
under
his
unfortunate
son
and
forced
him
after
some
unimportant
attempts
to
renounce
all
further
participation
in
the
german
war
in
order
to
stem
within
his
own
kingdom
the
rage
of
faction
two
illustrious
monarchs
far
unequal
in
personal
reputation
but
equal
in
power
and
desire
of
fame
made
the
north
at
this
time
to
be
respected
under
the
long
and
active
reign
of
christian
denmark
had
risen
into
importance
the
personal
qualifications
of
this
prince
an
excellent
navy
a
formidable
army
finances
and
prudent
alliances
had
combined
to
give
her
prosperity
at
home
and
influence
abroad
gustavus
vasa
had
rescued
sweden
from
vassalage
reformed
it
by
wise
laws
and
had
introduced
for
the
first
time
this
state
into
the
field
of
european
politics
what
this
great
prince
had
merely
sketched
in
rude
outline

filled
up
by
gustavus

his
still
greater
grandson
these
two
kingdoms
once
unnaturally
united
and
enfeebled
by
their
union
had
been
violently
separated
at
the
time
of
the
reformation
and
this
separation
was
the
epoch
of
their
prosperity
injurious
as
this
compulsory
union
had
proved
to
both
kingdoms
equally
necessary
to
each

were
neighbourly
friendship
and
harmony
on
both
the
evangelical
church

the
same
seas
to
protect
a
common
interest

to
unite
them
against
the
same
enemy
but
the
hatred
which
had
dissolved
the
union
of
these
monarchies
continued
long
after
their
separation
to
divide
the
two
nations
the
danish
kings
could
not
abandon
their
pretensions
to
the
swedish
crown
nor
the
swedes
banish
the
remembrance
of
danish
oppression
the
contiguous
boundaries
of
the
two
kingdoms
constantly
furnished
materials
for
international
quarrels
while
the
watchful
jealousy
of
both
kings
and
the
unavoidable
collision
of
their
commercial
interests
in
the
north
seas
were
inexhaustible
sources
of
dispute
among
the
means
of
which
gustavus
vasa
the
founder
of
the
swedish
monarchy
availed
himself
to
strengthen
his
new
edifice
the
reformation
had
been
one
of
the
principal
a
fundamental
law
of
the
kingdom
excluded
the
adherents
of
popery
from
all
offices
of
the
state
and
prohibited
every
future
sovereign
of
sweden
from
altering
the
religious
constitution
of
the
kingdom
but
the
second
son
and
second
successor
of
gustavus
had
relapsed
into
popery
and
his
son
sigismund
also
king
of
poland
had
been
guilty
of
measures
which
menaced
both
the
constitution
and
the
established
church
headed
by
charles
duke
of
sudermania
the
third
son
of
gustavus
the
estates
made
a
courageous
resistance
which
terminated
at
last
in
an
open
civil
war
between
the
uncle
and
nephew
and
between
the
king
and
the
people
duke
charles
administrator
of
the
kingdom
during
the
absence
of
the
king
had
availed
himself
of
sigismund
long
residence
in
poland
and
the
just
displeasure
of
the
states
to
ingratiate
himself
with
the
nation
and
gradually
to
prepare
his
way
to
the
throne
his
views
were
not
a
little
forwarded
by
sigismund
imprudence
a
general
diet
ventured
to
abolish
in
favour
of
the
protector
the
rule
of
primogeniture
which
gustavus
had
established
in
the
succession
and
placed
the
duke
of
sudermania
on
the
throne
from
which
sigismund
with
his
whole
posterity
were
solemnly
excluded
the
son
of
the
new
king
who
reigned
under
the
name
of
charles
ix
was
gustavus
adolphus
whom
as
the
son
of
a
usurper
the
adherents
of
sigismund
refused
to
recognize
but
if
the
obligations
between
monarchy
and
subjects
are
reciprocal
and
states
are
not
to
be
transmitted
like
a
lifeless
heirloom
from
hand
to
hand
a
nation
acting
with
unanimity
must
have
the
power
of
renouncing
their
allegiance
to
a
sovereign
who
has
violated
his
obligations
to
them
and
of
filling
his
place
by
a
worthier
object
gustavus
adolphus
had
not
completed
his
seventeenth
year
when
the
swedish
throne
became
vacant
by
the
death
of
his
father
but
the
early
maturity
of
his
genius
enabled
the
estates
to
abridge
in
his
favour
the
legal
period
of
minority
with
a
glorious
conquest
over
himself
he
commenced
a
reign
which
was
to
have
victory
for
its
constant
attendant
a
career
which
was
to
begin
and
end
in
success
the
young
countess
of
brahe
the
daughter
of
a
subject
had
gained
his
early
affections
and
he
had
resolved
to
share
with
her
the
swedish
throne
but
constrained
by
time
and
circumstances
he
made
his
attachment
yield
to
the
higher
duties
of
a
king
and
heroism
again
took
exclusive
possession
of
a
heart
which
was
not
destined
by
nature
to
confine
itself
within
the
limits
of
quiet
domestic
happiness
christian
iv
of
denmark
who
had
ascended
the
throne
before
the
birth
of
gustavus
in
an
inroad
upon
sweden
had
gained
some
considerable
advantages
over
the
father
of
that
hero
gustavus
adolphus
hastened
to
put
an
end
to
this
destructive
war
and
by
prudent
sacrifices
obtained
a
peace
in
order
to
turn
his
arms
against
the
czar
of
muscovy
the
questionable
fame
of
a
conqueror
never
tempted
him
to
spend
the
blood
of
his
subjects
in
unjust
wars
but
he
never
shrunk
from
a
just
one
his
arms
were
successful
against
russia
and
sweden
was
augmented
by
several
important
provinces
on
the
east
in
the
meantime
sigismund
of
poland
retained
against
the
son
the
same
sentiments
of
hostility
which
the
father
had
provoked
and
left
no
artifice
untried
to
shake
the
allegiance
of
his
subjects
to
cool
the
ardour
of
his
friends
and
to
embitter
his
enemies
neither
the
great
qualities
of
his
rival
nor
the
repeated
proofs
of
devotion
which
sweden
gave
to
her
loved
monarch
could
extinguish
in
this
infatuated
prince
the
foolish
hope
of
regaining
his
lost
throne
all
gustavus
overtures
were
haughtily
rejected
unwillingly
was
this
really
peaceful
king
involved
in
a
tedious
war
with
poland
in
which
the
whole
of
livonia
and
polish
prussia
were
successively
conquered
though
constantly
victorious
gustavus
adolphus
was
always
the
first
to
hold
out
the
hand
of
peace
this
contest
between
sweden
and
poland
falls
somewhere
about
the
beginning
of
the
thirty
years
war
in
germany
with
which
it
is
in
some
measure
connected
it
was
enough
that
sigismund
himself
a
roman
catholic
was
disputing
the
swedish
crown
with
a
protestant
prince
to
assure
him
the
active
support
of
spain
and
austria
while
a
double
relationship
to
the
emperor
gave
him
a
still
stronger
claim
to
his
protection
it
was
his
reliance
on
this
powerful
assistance
that
chiefly
encouraged
the
king
of
poland
to
continue
the
war
which
had
hitherto
turned
out
so
unfavourably
for
him
and
the
courts
of
madrid
and
vienna
failed
not
to
encourage
him
by
promises
while
sigismund
lost
one
place
after
another
in
livonia
courland
and
prussia
he
saw
his
ally
in
germany
advancing
from
conquest
after
conquest
to
unlimited
power
no
wonder
then
if
his
aversion
to
peace
kept
pace
with
his
losses
the
vehemence
with
which
he
nourished
his
chimerical
hopes
blinded
him
to
the
artful
policy
of
his
confederates
who
at
his
expense
were
keeping
the
swedish
hero
employed
in
order
to
overturn
without
opposition
the
liberties
of
germany
and
then
to
seize
on
the
exhausted
north
as
an
easy
conquest
one
circumstance
which
had
not
been
calculated
on
the
magnanimity
of
gustavus
overthrew
this
deceitful
policy
an
eight
years
war
in
poland
so
far
from
exhausting
the
power
of
sweden
had
only
served
to
mature
the
military
genius
of
gustavus
to
inure
the
swedish
army
to
warfare
and
insensibly
to
perfect
that
system
of
tactics
by
which
they
were
afterwards
to
perform
such
wonders
in
germany
after
this
necessary
digression
on
the
existing
circumstances
of
europe
i
now
resume
the
thread
of
my
history
ferdinand
had
regained
his
dominions
but
had
not
indemnified
himself
for
the
expenses
of
recovering
them
a
sum
of
forty
millions
of
florins
which
the
confiscations
in
bohemia
and
moravia
had
produced
would
have
sufficed
to
reimburse
both
himself
and
his
allies
but
the
jesuits
and
his
favourites
soon
squandered
this
sum
large
as
it
was
maximilian
duke
of
bavaria
to
whose
victorious
arm
principally
the
emperor
owed
the
recovery
of
his
dominions
who
in
the
service
of
religion
and
the
emperor
had
sacrificed
his
near
relation
had
the
strongest
claims
on
his
gratitude
and
moreover
in
a
treaty
which
before
the
war
the
duke
had
concluded
with
the
emperor
he
had
expressly
stipulated
for
the
reimbursement
of
all
expenses
ferdinand
felt
the
full
weight
of
the
obligation
imposed
upon
him
by
this
treaty
and
by
these
services
but
he
was
not
disposed
to
discharge
it
at
his
own
cost
his
purpose
was
to
bestow
a
brilliant
reward
upon
the
duke
but
without
detriment
to
himself
how
could
this
be
done
better
than
at
the
expense
of
the
unfortunate
prince
who
by
his
revolt
had
given
the
emperor
a
right
to
punish
him
and
whose
offences
might
be
painted
in
colours
strong
enough
to
justify
the
most
violent
measures
under
the
appearance
of
law
that
then
maximilian
may
be
rewarded
frederick
must
be
further
persecuted
and
totally
ruined
and
to
defray
the
expenses
of
the
old
war
a
new
one
must
be
commenced
but
a
still
stronger
motive
combined
to
enforce
the
first
hitherto
ferdinand
had
been
contending
for
existence
alone
he
had
been
fulfilling
no
other
duty
than
that
of
but
now
when
victory
gave
him
freedom
to
act
a
higher
duty
occurred
to
him
and
he
remembered
the
vow
which
he
had
made
at
loretto
and
at
rome
to
his
generalissima
the
holy
virgin
to
extend
her
worship
even
at
the
risk
of
his
crown
and
life
with
this
object
the
oppression
of
the
protestants
was
inseparably
connected
more
favourable
circumstances
for
its
accomplishment
could
not
offer
than
those
which
presented
themselves
at
the
close
of
the
bohemian
war
neither
the
power
nor
a
pretext
of
right
were
now
wanting
to
enable
him
to
place
the
palatinate
in
the
hands
of
the
catholics
and
the
importance
of
this
change
to
the
catholic
interests
in
germany
would
be
incalculable
thus
in
rewarding
the
duke
of
bavaria
with
the
spoils
of
his
relation
he
at
once
gratified
his
meanest
passions
and
fulfilled
his
most
exalted
duties
he
crushed
an
enemy
whom
he
hated
and
spared
his
avarice
a
painful
sacrifice
while
he
believed
he
was
winning
a
heavenly
crown
in
the
emperor
cabinet
the
ruin
of
frederick
had
been
resolved
upon
long
before
fortune
had
decided
against
him
but
it
was
only
after
this
event
that
they
ventured
to
direct
against
him
the
thunders
of
arbitrary
power
a
decree
of
the
emperor
destitute
of
all
the
formalities
required
on
such
occasions
by
the
laws
of
the
empire
pronounced
the
elector
and
three
other
princes
who
had
borne
arms
for
him
at
silesia
and
bohemia
as
offenders
against
the
imperial
majesty
and
disturbers
of
the
public
peace
under
the
ban
of
the
empire
and
deprived
them
of
their
titles
and
territories
the
execution
of
this
sentence
against
frederick
namely
the
seizure
of
his
lands
was
in
further
contempt
of
law
committed
to
spain
as
sovereign
of
the
circle
of
burgundy
to
the
duke
of
bavaria
and
the
league
had
the
evangelic
union
been
worthy
of
the
name
it
bore
and
of
the
cause
which
it
pretended
to
defend
insuperable
obstacles
might
have
prevented
the
execution
of
the
sentence
but
it
was
hopeless
for
a
power
which
was
far
from
a
match
even
for
the
spanish
troops
in
the
lower
palatinate
to
contend
against
the
united
strength
of
the
emperor
bavaria
and
the
league
the
sentence
of
proscription
pronounced
upon
the
elector
soon
detached
the
free
cities
from
the
union
and
the
princes
quickly
followed
their
example
fortunate
in
preserving
their
own
dominions
they
abandoned
the
elector
their
former
chief
to
the
emperor
mercy
renounced
the
union
and
vowed
never
to
revive
it
again
but
while
thus
ingloriously
the
german
princes
deserted
the
unfortunate
frederick
and
while
bohemia
silesia
and
moravia
submitted
to
the
emperor
a
single
man
a
soldier
of
fortune
whose
only
treasure
was
his
sword
ernest

mansfeld
dared
in
the
bohemian
town
of
pilsen
to
defy
the
whole
power
of
austria
left
without
assistance
after
the
battle
of
prague
by
the
elector
to
whose
service
he
had
devoted
himself
and
even
uncertain
whether
frederick
would
thank
him
for
his
perseverance
he
alone
for
some
time
held
out
against
the
imperialists
till
the
garrison
mutinying
for
want
of
pay
sold
the
town
to
the
emperor
undismayed
by
this
reverse
he
immediately
commenced
new
levies
in
the
upper
palatinate
and
enlisted
the
disbanded
troops
of
the
union
a
new
army
of
men
was
soon
assembled
under
his
banners
the
more
formidable
to
the
provinces
which
might
be
the
object
of
its
attack
because
it
must
subsist
by
plunder

where
this
swarm
might
light
the
neighbouring
bishops
trembled
for
their
rich
possessions
which
offered
a
tempting
prey
to
its
ravages
but
pressed
by
the
duke
of
bavaria
who
now
entered
the
upper
palatinate
mansfeld
was
compelled
to
retire
eluding
by
a
successful
stratagem
the
bavarian
general
tilly
who
was
in
pursuit
of
him
he
suddenly
appeared
in
the
lower
palatinate
and
there
wreaked
upon
the
bishoprics
of
the
rhine
the
severities
he
had
designed
for
those
of
franconia
while
the
imperial
and
bavarian
allies
thus
overran
bohemia
the
spanish
general
spinola
had
penetrated
with
a
numerous
army
from
the
netherlands
into
the
lower
palatinate
which
however
the
pacification
of
ulm
permitted
the
union
to
defend
but
their
measures
were
so
badly
concerted
that
one
place
after
another
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
spaniards
and
at
last
when
the
union
broke
up
the
greater
part
of
the
country
was
in
the
possession
of
spain
the
spanish
general
corduba
who
commanded
these
troops
after
the
recall
of
spinola
hastily
raised
the
siege
of
frankenthal
when
mansfeld
entered
the
lower
palatinate
but
instead
of
driving
the
spaniards
out
of
this
province
he
hastened
across
the
rhine
to
secure
for
his
needy
troops
shelter
and
subsistence
in
alsace
the
open
countries
on
which
this
swarm
of
maurauders
threw
themselves
were
converted
into
frightful
deserts
and
only
by
enormous
contributions
could
the
cities
purchase
an
exemption
from
plunder
reinforced
by
this
expedition
mansfeld
again
appeared
on
the
rhine
to
cover
the
lower
palatinate
so
long
as
such
an
arm
fought
for
him
the
cause
of
the
elector
frederick
was
not
irretrievably
lost
new
prospects
began
to
open
and
misfortune
raised
up
friends
who
had
been
silent
during
his
prosperity
king
james
of
england
who
had
looked
on
with
indifference
while
his
lost
the
bohemian
crown
was
aroused
from
his
insensibility
when
the
very
existence
of
his
daughter
and
grandson
was
at
stake
and
the
victorious
enemy
ventured
an
attack
upon
the
electorate
late
enough
he
at
last
opened
his
treasures
and
hastened
to
afford
supplies
of
money
and
troops
first
to
the
union
which
at
that
time
was
defending
the
lower
palatinate
and
afterwards
when
they
retired
to
count
mansfeld
by
his
means
his
near
relation
christian
king
of
denmark
was
induced
to
afford
his
active
support
at
the
same
time
the
approaching
expiration
of
the
truce
between
spain
and
holland
deprived
the
emperor
of
all
the
supplies
which
otherwise
he
might
expect
from
the
side
of
the
netherlands
more
important
still
was
the
assistance
which
the
palatinate
received
from
transylvania
and
hungary
the
cessation
of
hostilities
between
gabor
and
the
emperor
was
scarcely
at
an
end
when
this
old
and
formidable
enemy
of
austria
overran
hungary
anew
and
caused
himself
to
be
crowned
king
in
presburg
so
rapid
was
his
progress
that
to
protect
austria
and
hungary
boucquoi
was
obliged
to
evacuate
bohemia
this
brave
general
met
his
death
at
the
siege
of
neuhausel
as
shortly
before
the
no
less
valiant
dampierre
had
fallen
before
presburg
gabor
march
into
the
austrian
territory
was
irresistible
the
old
count
thurn
and
several
other
distinguished
bohemians
had
united
their
hatred
and
their
strength
with
this
irreconcileable
enemy
of
austria
a
vigorous
attack
on
the
side
of
germany
while
gabor
pressed
the
emperor
on
that
of
hungary
might
have
retrieved
the
fortunes
of
frederick
but
unfortunately
the
bohemians
and
germans
had
always
laid
down
their
arms
when
gabor
took
the
field
and
the
latter
was
always
exhausted
at
the
very
moment
that
the
former
began
to
recover
their
vigour
meanwhile
frederick
had
not
delayed
to
join
his
protector
mansfeld
in
disguise
he
entered
the
lower
palatinate
of
which
the
possession
was
at
that
time
disputed
between
mansfeld
and
the
bavarian
general
tilly
the
upper
palatinate
having
been
long
conquered
a
ray
of
hope
shone
upon
him
as
from
the
wreck
of
the
union
new
friends
came
forward
a
former
member
of
the
union
george
frederick
margrave
of
baden
had
for
some
time
been
engaged
in
assembling
a
military
force
which
soon
amounted
to
a
considerable
army
its
destination
was
kept
a
secret
till
he
suddenly
took
the
field
and
joined
mansfeld
before
commencing
the
war
he
resigned
his
margraviate
to
his
son
in
the
hope
of
eluding
by
this
precaution
the
emperor
revenge
if
his
enterprize
should
be
unsuccessful
his
neighbour
the
duke
of
wirtemberg
likewise
began
to
augment
his
military
force
the
courage
of
the
palatine
revived
and
he
laboured
assiduously
to
renew
the
protestant
union
it
was
now
time
for
tilly
to
consult
for
his
own
safety
and
he
hastily
summoned
the
spanish
troops
under
corduba
to
his
assistance
but
while
the
enemy
was
uniting
his
strength
mansfeld
and
the
margrave
separated
and
the
latter
was
defeated
by
the
bavarian
general
near
wimpfen
to
defend
a
king
whom
his
nearest
relation
persecuted
and
who
was
deserted
even
by
his
own
there
had
come
forward
an
adventurer
without
money
and
whose
very
legitimacy
was
questioned
a
sovereign
had
resigned
possessions
over
which
he
reigned
in
peace
to
hazard
the
uncertain
fortune
of
war
in
behalf
of
a
stranger
and
now
another
soldier
of
fortune
poor
in
territorial
possessions
but
rich
in
illustrious
ancestry
undertook
the
defence
of
a
cause
which
the
former
despaired
of
christian
duke
of
brunswick
administrator
of
halberstadt
seemed
to
have
learnt
from
count
mansfeld
the
secret
of
keeping
in
the
field
an
army
of
men
without
money
impelled
by
youthful
presumption
and
influenced
partly
by
the
wish
of
establishing
his
reputation
at
the
expense
of
the
roman
catholic
priesthood
whom
he
cordially
detested
and
partly
by
a
thirst
for
plunder
he
assembled
a
considerable
army
in
lower
saxony
under
the
pretext
of
espousing
the
defence
of
frederick
and
of
the
liberties
of
germany
god
friend
priest
foe
was
the
motto
he
chose
for
his
coinage
which
was
struck
out
of
church
plate
and
his
conduct
belied
one
half
at
least
of
the
device
the
progress
of
these
banditti
was
as
usual
marked
by
the
most
frightful
devastation
enriched
by
the
spoils
of
the
chapters
of
lower
saxony
and
westphalia
they
gathered
strength
to
plunder
the
bishoprics
upon
the
upper
rhine
driven
from
thence
both
by
friends
and
foes
the
administrator
approached
the
town
of
hoechst
on
the
maine
which
he
crossed
after
a
murderous
action
with
tilly
who
disputed
with
him
the
passage
of
the
river
with
the
loss
of
half
his
army
he
reached
the
opposite
bank
where
he
quickly
collected
his
shattered
troops
and
formed
a
junction
with
mansfeld
pursued
by
tilly
this
united
host
threw
itself
again
into
alsace
to
repeat
their
former
ravages
while
the
elector
frederick
followed
almost
like
a
fugitive
mendicant
this
swarm
of
plunderers
which
acknowledged
him
as
its
lord
and
dignified
itself
with
his
name
his
friends
were
busily
endeavouring
to
effect
a
reconciliation
between
him
and
the
emperor
ferdinand
took
care
not
to
deprive
them
of
all
hope
of
seeing
the
palatine
restored
to
his
dominion
full
of
artifice
and
dissimulation
he
pretended
to
be
willing
to
enter
into
a
negotiation
hoping
thereby
to
cool
their
ardour
in
the
field
and
to
prevent
them
from
driving
matters
to
extremity
james
ever
the
dupe
of
spanish
cunning
contributed
not
a
little
by
his
foolish
intermeddling
to
promote
the
emperor
schemes
ferdinand
insisted
that
frederick
if
he
would
appeal
to
his
clemency
should
first
of
all
lay
down
his
arms
and
james
considered
this
demand
extremely
reasonable
at
his
instigation
the
elector
dismissed
his
only
real
defenders
count
mansfeld
and
the
administrator
and
in
holland
awaited
his
own
fate
from
the
mercy
of
the
emperor
mansfeld
and
duke
christian
were
now
at
a
loss
for
some
new
name
the
cause
of
the
elector
had
not
set
them
in
motion
so
his
dismissal
could
not
disarm
them
war
was
their
object
it
was
all
the
same
to
them
in
whose
cause
or
name
it
was
waged
after
some
vain
attempts
on
the
part
of
mansfeld
to
be
received
into
the
emperor
service
both
marched
into
lorraine
where
the
excesses
of
their
troops
spread
terror
even
to
the
heart
of
france
here
they
long
waited
in
vain
for
a
master
willing
to
purchase
their
services
till
the
dutch
pressed
by
the
spanish
general
spinola
offered
to
take
them
into
pay
after
a
bloody
fight
at
fleurus
with
the
spaniards
who
attempted
to
intercept
them
they
reached
holland
where
their
appearance
compelled
the
spanish
general
forthwith
to
raise
the
siege
of
but
even
holland
was
soon
weary
of
these
dangerous
guests
and
availed
herself
of
the
first
moment
to
get
rid
of
their
unwelcome
assistance
mansfeld
allowed
his
troops
to
recruit
themselves
for
new
enterprises
in
the
fertile
province
of
east
friezeland
duke
christian
passionately
enamoured
of
the
electress
palatine
with
whom
he
had
become
acquainted
in
holland
and
more
disposed
for
war
than
ever
led
back
his
army
into
lower
saxony
bearing
that
princess
glove
in
his
hat
and
on
his
standards
the
motto
all
for
god
and
her
neither
of
these
adventurers
had
as
yet
run
their
career
in
this
war
all
the
imperial
territories
were
now
free
from
the
enemy
the
union
was
dissolved
the
margrave
of
baden
duke
christian
and
mansfeld
driven
from
the
field
and
the
palatinate
overrun
by
the
executive
troops
of
the
empire
manheim
and
heidelberg
were
in
possession
of
bavaria
and
frankenthal
was
shortly
afterwards
ceded
to
the
spaniards
the
palatine
in
a
distant
corner
of
holland
awaited
the
disgraceful
permission
to
appease
by
abject
submission
the
vengeance
of
the
emperor
and
an
electoral
diet
was
at
last
summoned
to
decide
his
fate
that
fate
however
had
been
long
before
decided
at
the
court
of
the
emperor
though
now
for
the
first
time
were
circumstances
favourable
for
giving
publicity
to
the
decision
after
his
past
measures
towards
the
elector
ferdinand
believed
that
a
sincere
reconciliation
was
not
to
be
hoped
for
the
violent
course
he
had
once
begun
must
be
completed
successfully
or
recoil
upon
himself
what
was
already
lost
was
irrecoverable
frederick
could
never
hope
to
regain
his
dominions
and
a
prince
without
territory
and
without
subjects
had
little
chance
of
retaining
the
electoral
crown
deeply
as
the
palatine
had
offended
against
the
house
of
austria
the
services
of
the
duke
of
bavaria
were
no
less
meritorious
if
the
house
of
austria
and
the
roman
catholic
church
had
much
to
dread
from
the
resentment
and
religious
rancour
of
the
palatine
family
they
had
as
much
to
hope
from
the
gratitude
and
religious
zeal
of
the
bavarian
lastly
by
the
cession
of
the
palatine
electorate
to
bavaria
the
roman
catholic
religion
would
obtain
a
decisive
preponderance
in
the
electoral
college
and
secure
a
permanent
triumph
in
germany
the
last
circumstance
was
sufficient
to
win
the
support
of
the
three
ecclesiastical
electors
to
this
innovation
and
among
the
protestants
the
vote
of
saxony
was
alone
of
any
importance
but
could
john
george
be
expected
to
dispute
with
the
emperor
a
right
without
which
he
would
expose
to
question
his
own
title
to
the
electoral
dignity
to
a
prince
whom
descent
dignity
and
political
power
placed
at
the
head
of
the
protestant
church
in
germany
nothing
it
is
true
ought
to
be
more
sacred
than
the
defence
of
the
rights
of
that
church
against
all
the
encroachments
of
the
roman
catholics
but
the
question
here
was
not
whether
the
interests
of
the
protestants
were
to
be
supported
against
the
roman
catholics
but
which
of
two
religions
equally
detested
the
calvinistic
and
the
popish
was
to
triumph
over
the
other
to
which
of
the
two
enemies
equally
dangerous
the
palatinate
was
to
be
assigned
and
in
this
clashing
of
opposite
duties
it
was
natural
that
private
hate
and
private
gain
should
determine
the
event
the
born
protector
of
the
liberties
of
germany
and
of
the
protestant
religion
encouraged
the
emperor
to
dispose
of
the
palatinate
by
his
imperial
prerogative
and
to
apprehend
no
resistance
on
the
part
of
saxony
to
his
measures
on
the
mere
ground
of
form
if
the
elector
was
afterwards
disposed
to
retract
this
consent
ferdinand
himself
by
driving
the
evangelical
preachers
from
bohemia
was
the
cause
of
this
change
of
opinion
and
in
the
eyes
of
the
elector
the
transference
of
the
palatine
electorate
to
bavaria
ceased
to
be
illegal
as
soon
as
ferdinand
was
prevailed
upon
to
cede
lusatia
to
saxony
in
consideration
of
six
millions
of
dollars
as
the
expenses
of
the
war
thus
in
defiance
of
all
protestant
germany
and
in
mockery
of
the
fundamental
laws
of
the
empire
which
as
his
election
he
had
sworn
to
maintain
ferdinand
at
ratisbon
solemnly
invested
the
duke
of
bavaria
with
the
palatinate
without
prejudice
as
the
form
ran
to
the
rights
which
the
relations
or
descendants
of
frederick
might
afterwards
establish
that
unfortunate
prince
thus
saw
himself
irrevocably
driven
from
his
possessions
without
having
been
even
heard
before
the
tribunal
which
condemned
him
a
privilege
which
the
law
allows
to
the
meanest
subject
and
even
to
the
most
atrocious
criminal
this
violent
step
at
last
opened
the
eyes
of
the
king
of
england
and
as
the
negociations
for
the
marriage
of
his
son
with
the
infanta
of
spain
were
now
broken
off
james
began
seriously
to
espouse
the
cause
of
his
a
change
in
the
french
ministry
had
placed
cardinal
richelieu
at
the
head
of
affairs
and
this
fallen
kingdom
soon
began
to
feel
that
a
great
mind
was
at
the
helm
of
state
the
attempts
of
the
spanish
viceroy
in
milan
to
gain
possession
of
the
valtelline
and
thus
to
form
a
junction
with
the
austrian
hereditary
dominions
revived
the
olden
dread
of
this
power
and
with
it
the
policy
of
henry
the
great
the
marriage
of
the
prince
of
wales
with
henrietta
of
france
established
a
close
union
between
the
two
crowns
and
to
this
alliance
holland
denmark
and
some
of
the
italian
states
presently
acceded
its
object
was
to
expel
by
force
of
arms
spain
from
the
valtelline
and
to
compel
austria
to
reinstate
frederick
but
only
the
first
of
these
designs
was
prosecuted
with
vigour
james
died
and
charles
involved
in
disputes
with
his
parliament
could
not
bestow
attention
on
the
affairs
of
germany
savoy
and
venice
withheld
their
assistance
and
the
french
minister
thought
it
necessary
to
subdue
the
huguenots
at
home
before
he
supported
the
german
protestants
against
the
emperor
great
as
were
the
hopes
which
had
been
formed
from
this
alliance
they
were
yet
equalled
by
the
disappointment
of
the
event
mansfeld
deprived
of
all
support
remained
inactive
on
the
lower
rhine
and
duke
christian
of
brunswick
after
an
unsuccessful
campaign
was
a
second
time
driven
out
of
germany
a
fresh
irruption
of
bethlen
gabor
into
moravia
frustrated
by
the
want
of
support
from
the
germans
terminated
like
all
the
rest
in
a
formal
peace
with
the
emperor
the
union
was
no
more
no
protestant
prince
was
in
arms
and
on
the
frontiers
of
lower
germany
the
bavarian
general
tilly
at
the
head
of
a
victorious
army
encamped
in
the
protestant
territory
the
movements
of
the
duke
of
brunswick
had
drawn
him
into
this
quarter
and
even
into
the
circle
of
lower
saxony
when
he
made
himself
master
of
the
administrator
magazines
at
lippstadt
the
necessity
of
observing
this
enemy
and
preventing
him
from
new
inroads
was
the
pretext
assigned
for
continuing
tilly
stay
in
the
country
but
in
truth
both
mansfeld
and
duke
christian
had
from
want
of
money
disbanded
their
armies
and
count
tilly
had
no
enemy
to
dread
why
then
still
burden
the
country
with
his
presence
it
is
difficult
amidst
the
uproar
of
contending
parties
to
distinguish
the
voice
of
truth
but
certainly
it
was
matter
for
alarm
that
the
league
did
not
lay
down
its
arms
the
premature
rejoicings
of
the
roman
catholics
too
were
calculated
to
increase
apprehension
the
emperor
and
the
league
stood
armed
and
victorious
in
germany
without
a
power
to
oppose
them
should
they
venture
to
attack
the
protestant
states
and
to
annul
the
religious
treaty
had
ferdinand
been
in
reality
far
from
disposed
to
abuse
his
conquests
still
the
defenceless
position
of
the
protestants
was
most
likely
to
suggest
the
temptation
obsolete
conventions
could
not
bind
a
prince
who
thought
that
he
owed
all
to
religion
and
believed
that
a
religious
creed
would
sanctify
any
deed
however
violent
upper
germany
was
already
overpowered
lower
germany
alone
could
check
his
despotic
authority
here
the
protestants
still
predominated
the
church
had
been
forcibly
deprived
of
most
of
its
endowments
and
the
present
appeared
a
favourable
moment
for
recovering
these
lost
possessions
a
great
part
of
the
strength
of
the
lower
german
princes
consisted
in
these
chapters
and
the
plea
of
restoring
its
own
to
the
church
afforded
an
excellent
pretext
for
weakening
these
princes
unpardonable
would
have
been
their
negligence
had
they
remained
inactive
in
this
danger
the
remembrance
of
the
ravages
which
tilly
army
had
committed
in
lower
saxony
was
too
recent
not
to
arouse
the
estates
to
measures
of
defence
with
all
haste
the
circle
of
lower
saxony
began
to
arm
itself
extraordinary
contributions
were
levied
troops
collected
and
magazines
filled
negociations
for
subsidies
were
set
on
foot
with
venice
holland
and
england
they
deliberated
too
what
power
should
be
placed
at
the
head
of
the
confederacy
the
kings
of
the
sound
and
the
baltic
the
natural
allies
of
this
circle
would
not
see
with
indifference
the
emperor
treating
it
as
a
conqueror
and
establishing
himself
as
their
neighbour
on
the
shores
of
the
north
sea
the
twofold
interests
of
religion
and
policy
urged
them
to
put
a
stop
to
his
progress
in
lower
germany
christian
iv
of
denmark
as
duke
of
holstein
was
himself
a
prince
of
this
circle
and
by
considerations
equally
powerful
gustavus
adolphus
of
sweden
was
induced
to
join
the
confederacy
these
two
kings
vied
with
each
other
for
the
honour
of
defending
lower
saxony
and
of
opposing
the
formidable
power
of
austria
each
offered
to
raise
a
army
and
to
lead
it
in
person
his
victorious
campaigns
against
moscow
and
poland
gave
weight
to
the
promises
of
the
king
of
sweden
the
shores
of
the
baltic
were
full
of
the
name
of
gustavus
but
the
fame
of
his
rival
excited
the
envy
of
the
danish
monarch
and
the
more
success
he
promised
himself
in
this
campaign
the
less
disposed
was
he
to
show
any
favour
to
his
envied
neighbour
both
laid
their
conditions
and
plans
before
the
english
ministry
and
christian
iv
finally
succeeded
in
outbidding
his
rival
gustavus
adolphus
for
his
own
security
had
demanded
the
cession
of
some
places
of
strength
in
germany
where
he
himself
had
no
territories
to
afford
in
case
of
need
a
place
of
refuge
for
his
troops
christian
iv
possessed
holstein
and
jutland
through
which
in
the
event
of
a
defeat
he
could
always
secure
a
retreat
eager
to
get
the
start
of
his
competitor
the
king
of
denmark
hastened
to
take
the
field
appointed
generalissimo
of
the
circle
of
lower
saxony
he
soon
had
an
army
of
men
in
motion
the
administrator
of
magdeburg
and
the
dukes
of
brunswick
and
mecklenburgh
entered
into
an
alliance
with
him
encouraged
by
the
hope
of
assistance
from
england
and
the
possession
of
so
large
a
force
he
flattered
himself
he
should
be
able
to
terminate
the
war
in
a
single
campaign
at
vienna
it
was
officially
notified
that
the
only
object
of
these
preparations
was
the
protection
of
the
circle
and
the
maintenance
of
peace
but
the
negociations
with
holland
england
and
even
france
the
extraordinary
exertions
of
the
circle
and
the
raising
of
so
formidable
an
army
seemed
to
have
something
more
in
view
than
defensive
operations
and
to
contemplate
nothing
less
than
the
complete
restoration
of
the
elector
palatine
and
the
humiliation
of
the
dreaded
power
of
austria
after
negociations
exhortations
commands
and
threats
had
in
vain
been
employed
by
the
emperor
in
order
to
induce
the
king
of
denmark
and
the
circle
of
lower
saxony
to
lay
down
their
arms
hostilities
commenced
and
lower
germany
became
the
theatre
of
war
count
tilly
marching
along
the
left
bank
of
the
weser
made
himself
master
of
all
the
passes
as
far
as
minden
after
an
unsuccessful
attack
on
nieuburg
he
crossed
the
river
and
overran
the
principality
of
calemberg
in
which
he
quartered
his
troops
the
king
conducted
his
operations
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
and
spread
his
forces
over
the
territories
of
brunswick
but
having
weakened
his
main
body
by
too
powerful
detachments
he
could
not
engage
in
any
enterprise
of
importance
aware
of
his
opponent
superiority
he
avoided
a
decisive
action
as
anxiously
as
the
general
of
the
league
sought
it
with
the
exception
of
the
troops
from
the
spanish
netherlands
which
had
poured
into
the
lower
palatinate
the
emperor
had
hitherto
made
use
only
of
the
arms
of
bavaria
and
the
league
in
germany
maximilian
conducted
the
war
as
executor
of
the
ban
of
the
empire
and
tilly
who
commanded
the
army
of
execution
was
in
the
bavarian
service
the
emperor
owed
superiority
in
the
field
to
bavaria
and
the
league
and
his
fortunes
were
in
their
hands
this
dependence
on
their
goodwill
but
ill
accorded
with
the
grand
schemes
which
the
brilliant
commencement
of
the
war
had
led
the
imperial
cabinet
to
form
however
active
the
league
had
shown
itself
in
the
emperor
defence
while
thereby
it
secured
its
own
welfare
it
could
not
be
expected
that
it
would
enter
as
readily
into
his
views
of
conquest
or
if
they
still
continued
to
lend
their
armies
for
that
purpose
it
was
too
much
to
be
feared
that
they
would
share
with
the
emperor
nothing
but
general
odium
while
they
appropriated
to
themselves
all
advantages
a
strong
army
under
his
own
orders
could
alone
free
him
from
this
debasing
dependence
upon
bavaria
and
restore
to
him
his
former
in
germany
but
the
war
had
already
exhausted
the
imperial
dominions
and
they
were
unequal
to
the
expense
of
such
an
armament
in
these
circumstances
nothing
could
be
more
welcome
to
the
emperor
than
the
proposal
with
which
one
of
his
officers
surprised
him
this
was
count
wallenstein
an
experienced
officer
and
the
richest
nobleman
in
bohemia
from
his
earliest
youth
he
had
been
in
the
service
of
the
house
of
austria
and
several
campaigns
against
the
turks
venetians
bohemians
hungarians
and
transylvanians
had
established
his
reputation
he
was
present
as
colonel
at
the
battle
of
prague
and
afterwards
as
had
defeated
a
hungarian
force
in
moravia
the
emperor
gratitude
was
equal
to
his
services
and
a
large
share
of
the
confiscated
estates
of
the
bohemian
insurgents
was
their
reward
possessed
of
immense
property
excited
by
ambitious
views
confident
in
his
own
good
fortune
and
still
more
encouraged
by
the
existing
state
of
circumstances
he
offered
at
his
own
expense
and
that
of
his
friends
to
raise
and
clothe
an
army
for
the
emperor
and
even
undertook
the
cost
of
maintaining
it
if
he
were
allowed
to
augment
it
to
men
the
project
was
universally
ridiculed
as
the
chimerical
offspring
of
a
visionary
brain
but
the
offer
was
highly
valuable
if
its
promises
should
be
but
partially
fulfilled
certain
circles
in
bohemia
were
assigned
to
him
as
depots
with
authority
to
appoint
his
own
officers
in
a
few
months
he
had
men
under
arms
with
which
quitting
the
austrian
territories
he
soon
afterwards
appeared
on
the
frontiers
of
lower
saxony
with
the
emperor
had
lent
this
armament
nothing
but
his
name
the
reputation
of
the
general
the
prospect
of
rapid
promotion
and
the
hope
of
plunder
attracted
to
his
standard
adventurers
from
all
quarters
of
germany
and
even
sovereign
princes
stimulated
by
the
desire
of
glory
or
of
gain
offered
to
raise
regiments
for
the
service
of
austria
now
therefore
for
the
first
time
in
this
war
an
imperial
army
appeared
in
germany
an
event
which
if
it
was
menacing
to
the
protestants
was
scarcely
more
acceptable
to
the
catholics
wallenstein
had
orders
to
unite
his
army
with
the
troops
of
the
league
and
in
conjunction
with
the
bavarian
general
to
attack
the
king
of
denmark
but
long
jealous
of
tilly
fame
he
showed
no
disposition
to
share
with
him
the
laurels
of
the
campaign
or
in
the
splendour
of
his
rival
achievements
to
dim
the
lustre
of
his
own
his
plan
of
operations
was
to
support
the
latter
but
to
act
entirely
independent
of
him
as
he
had
not
resources
like
tilly
for
supplying
the
wants
of
his
army
he
was
obliged
to
march
his
troops
into
fertile
countries
which
had
not
as
yet
suffered
from
war
disobeying
therefore
the
order
to
form
a
junction
with
the
general
of
the
league
he
marched
into
the
territories
of
halberstadt
and
magdeburg
and
at
dessau
made
himself
master
of
the
elbe
all
the
lands
on
either
bank
of
this
river
were
at
his
command
and
from
them
he
could
either
attack
the
king
of
denmark
in
the
rear
or
if
prudent
enter
the
territories
of
that
prince
christian
iv
was
fully
aware
of
the
danger
of
his
situation
between
two
such
powerful
armies
he
had
already
been
joined
by
the
administrator
of
halberstadt
who
had
lately
returned
from
holland
he
now
also
acknowledged
mansfeld
whom
previously
he
had
refused
to
recognise
and
supported
him
to
the
best
of
his
ability
mansfeld
amply
requited
this
service
he
alone
kept
at
bay
the
army
of
wallenstein
upon
the
elbe
and
prevented
its
junction
with
that
of
tilly
and
a
combined
attack
on
the
king
of
denmark
notwithstanding
the
enemy
superiority
this
intrepid
general
even
approached
the
bridge
of
dessau
and
ventured
to
entrench
himself
in
presence
of
the
imperial
lines
but
attacked
in
the
rear
by
the
whole
force
of
the
imperialists
he
was
obliged
to
yield
to
superior
numbers
and
to
abandon
his
post
with
the
loss
of
killed
after
this
defeat
mansfeld
withdrew
into
brandenburg
where
he
soon
recruited
and
reinforced
his
army
and
suddenly
turned
into
silesia
with
the
view
of
marching
from
thence
into
hungary
and
in
conjunction
with
bethlen
gabor
carrying
the
war
into
the
heart
of
austria
as
the
austrian
dominions
in
that
quarter
were
entirely
defenceless
wallenstein
received
immediate
orders
to
leave
the
king
of
denmark
and
if
possible
to
intercept
mansfeld
progress
through
silesia
the
diversion
which
this
movement
of
mansfeld
had
made
in
the
plans
of
wallenstein
enabled
the
king
to
detach
a
part
of
his
force
into
westphalia
to
seize
the
bishoprics
of
munster
and
osnaburg
to
check
this
movement
tilly
suddenly
moved
from
the
weser
but
the
operations
of
duke
christian
who
threatened
the
territories
of
the
league
with
an
inroad
in
the
direction
of
hesse
and
to
remove
thither
the
seat
of
war
recalled
him
as
rapidly
from
westphalia
in
order
to
keep
open
his
communication
with
these
provinces
and
to
prevent
the
junction
of
the
enemy
with
the
landgrave
of
hesse
tilly
hastily
seized
all
the
tenable
posts
on
the
werha
and
fulda
and
took
up
a
strong
position
in
minden
at
the
foot
of
the
hessian
mountains
and
at
the
confluence
of
these
rivers
with
the
weser
he
soon
made
himself
master
of
goettingen
the
key
of
brunswick
and
hesse
and
was
meditating
a
similar
attack
upon
nordheim
when
the
king
advanced
upon
him
with
his
whole
army
after
throwing
into
this
place
the
necessary
supplies
for
a
long
siege
the
latter
attempted
to
open
a
new
passage
through
eichsfeld
and
thuringia
into
the
territories
of
the
league
he
had
already
reached
duderstadt
when
tilly
by
forced
marches
came
up
with
him
as
the
army
of
tilly
which
had
been
reinforced
by
some
of
wallenstein
regiments
was
superior
in
numbers
to
his
own
the
king
to
avoid
a
battle
retreated
towards
brunswick
but
tilly
incessantly
harassed
his
retreat
and
after
three
days
skirmishing
he
was
at
length
obliged
to
await
the
enemy
near
the
village
of
lutter
in
barenberg
the
danes
began
the
attack
with
great
bravery
and
thrice
did
their
intrepid
monarch
lead
them
in
person
against
the
enemy
but
at
length
the
superior
numbers
and
discipline
of
the
imperialists
prevailed
and
the
general
of
the
league
obtained
a
complete
victory
the
danes
lost
sixty
standards
and
their
whole
artillery
baggage
and
ammunition
several
officers
of
distinction
and
about
men
were
killed
in
the
field
of
battle
and
several
companies
of
foot
in
the
flight
who
had
thrown
themselves
into
the
of
lutter
laid
down
their
arms
and
surrendered
to
the
conqueror
the
king
fled
with
his
cavalry
and
soon
collected
the
wreck
of
his
army
which
had
survived
this
serious
defeat
tilly
pursued
his
victory
made
himself
master
of
the
weser
and
brunswick
and
forced
the
king
to
retire
into
bremen
rendered
more
cautious
by
defeat
the
latter
now
stood
upon
the
defensive
and
determined
at
all
events
to
prevent
the
enemy
from
crossing
the
elbe
but
while
he
threw
garrisons
into
every
tenable
place
he
reduced
his
own
diminished
army
to
inactivity
and
one
after
another
his
scattered
troops
were
either
defeated
or
dispersed
the
forces
of
the
league
in
command
of
the
weser
spread
themselves
along
the
elbe
and

and
everywhere
drove
the
danes
before
them
tilly
himself
crossing
the
elbe
penetrated
with
his
victorious
army
into
brandenburg
while
wallenstein
entered
holstein
to
remove
the
seat
of
war
to
the
king
own
dominions
this
general
had
just
returned
from
hungary
whither
he
had
pursued
mansfeld
without
being
able
to
obstruct
his
march
or
prevent
his
junction
with
bethlen
gabor
constantly
persecuted
by
fortune
but
always
superior
to
his
fate
mansfeld
had
made
his
way
against
countless
difficulties
through
silesia
and
hungary
to
transylvania
where
after
all
he
was
not
very
welcome
relying
upon
the
assistance
of
england
and
a
powerful
diversion
in
lower
saxony
gabor
had
again
broken
the
truce
with
the
emperor
but
in
place
of
the
expected
diversion
in
his
favour
mansfeld
had
drawn
upon
himself
the
whole
strength
of
wallenstein
and
instead
of
bringing
required
pecuniary
assistance
the
want
of
concert
in
the
protestant
counsels
cooled
gabor
ardour
and
he
hastened
as
usual
to
avert
the
coming
storm
by
a
speedy
peace
firmly
determined
however
to
break
it
with
the
first
ray
of
hope
he
directed
mansfeld
in
the
mean
time
to
apply
for
assistance
to
venice
cut
off
from
germany
and
unable
to
support
the
weak
remnant
of
his
troops
in
hungary
mansfeld
sold
his
artillery
and
baggage
train
and
disbanded
his
soldiers
with
a
few
followers
he
proceeded
through
bosnia
and
dalmatia
towards
venice
new
schemes
swelled
his
bosom
but
his
career
was
ended
fate
which
had
so
restlessly
sported
with
him
throughout
now
prepared
for
him
a
peaceful
grave
in
dalmatia
death
overtook
him
in
the
vicinity
of
zara
in
and
a
short
time
before
him
died
the
faithful
companion
of
his
fortunes
christian
duke
of
brunswick
two
men
worthy
of
immortality
had
they
but
been
as
superior
to
their
times
as
they
were
to
their
adversities
the
king
of
denmark
with
his
whole
army
was
unable
to
cope
with
tilly
alone
much
less
therefore
with
a
shattered
force
could
he
hold
his
ground
against
the
two
imperial
generals
the
danes
retired
from
all
their
posts
on
the
weser
the
elbe
and
the
havel
and
the
army
of
wallenstein
poured
like
a
torrent
into
brandenburg
mecklenburg
holstein
and
sleswick
that
general
too
proud
to
act
in
conjunction
with
another
had
dispatched
tilly
across
the
elbe
to
watch
as
he
gave
out
the
motions
of
the
dutch
in
that
quarter
but
in
reality
that
he
might
terminate
the
war
against
the
king
and
reap
for
himself
the
fruits
of
tilly
conquests
christian
had
now
lost
all
his
fortresses
in
the
german
states
with
the
exception
of
gluckstadt
his
armies
were
defeated
or
dispersed
no
assistance
came
from
germany
from
england
little
consolation
while
his
confederates
in
lower
saxony
were
at
the
mercy
of
the
conqueror
the
landgrave
of
hesse
cassel
had
been
forced
by
tilly
soon
after
the
battle
of
lutter
to
renounce
the
danish
alliance
wallenstein
formidable
appearance
before
berlin
reduced
the
elector
of
brandenburgh
to
submission
and
compelled
him
to
recognise
as
legitimate
maximilian
title
to
the
palatine
electorate
the
greater
part
of
mecklenburgh
was
now
overrun
by
imperial
troops
and
both
dukes
as
adherents
of
the
king
of
denmark
placed
under
the
ban
of
the
empire
and
driven
from
their
dominions
the
defence
of
the
german
liberties
against
illegal
encroachments
was
punished
as
a
crime
deserving
the
loss
of
all
dignities
and
territories
and
yet
this
was
but
the
prelude
to
the
still
more
crying
enormities
which
shortly
followed
the
secret
how
wallenstein
had
purposed
to
fulfil
his
extravagant
designs
was
now
manifest
he
had
learned
the
lesson
from
count
mansfeld
but
the
scholar
surpassed
his
master
on
the
principle
that
war
must
support
war
mansfeld
and
the
duke
of
brunswick
had
subsisted
their
troops
by
contributions
levied
indiscriminately
on
friend
and
enemy
but
this
predatory
life
was
attended
with
all
the
inconvenience
and
insecurity
which
accompany
robbery
like
a
fugitive
banditti
they
were
obliged
to
steal
through
exasperated
and
vigilant
enemies
to
roam
from
one
end
of
germany
to
another
to
watch
their
opportunity
with
anxiety
and
to
abandon
the
most
fertile
territories
whenever
they
were
defended
by
a
superior
army
if
mansfeld
and
duke
christian
had
done
such
great
things
in
the
face
of
these
difficulties
what
might
not
be
expected
if
the
obstacles
were
removed
when
the
army
raised
was
numerous
enough
to
overawe
in
itself
the
most
powerful
states
of
the
empire
when
the
name
of
the
emperor
insured
impunity
to
every
outrage
and
when
under
the
highest
authority
and
at
the
head
of
an
overwhelming
force
the
same
system
of
warfare
was
pursued
which
these
two
adventurers
had
hitherto
adopted
at
their
own
risk
and
with
only
an
untrained
multitude
wallenstein
had
all
this
in
view
when
he
made
his
bold
offer
to
the
emperor
which
now
seemed
extravagant
to
no
one
the
more
his
army
was
augmented
the
less
cause
was
there
to
fear
for
its
subsistence
because
it
could
irresistibly
bear
down
upon
the
refractory
states
the
more
violent
its
outrages
the
more
probable
was
impunity
towards
hostile
states
it
had
the
plea
of
right
towards
the
favourably
disposed
it
could
allege
necessity
the
inequality
too
with
which
it
dealt
out
its
oppressions
prevented
any
dangerous
union
among
the
states
while
the
exhaustion
of
their
territories
deprived
them
of
the
power
of
vengeance
thus
the
whole
of
germany
became
a
kind
of
magazine
for
the
imperial
army
and
the
emperor
was
enabled
to
deal
with
the
other
states
as
absolutely
as
with
his
own
hereditary
dominions
universal
was
the
clamour
for
redress
before
the
imperial
throne
but
there
was
nothing
to
fear
from
the
revenge
of
the
injured
princes
so
long
as
they
appealed
for
justice
the
general
discontent
was
directed
equally
against
the
emperor
who
had
lent
his
name
to
these
barbarities
and
the
general
who
exceeded
his
power
and
openly
abused
the
authority
of
his
master
they
applied
to
the
emperor
for
protection
against
the
outrages
of
his
general
but
wallenstein
had
no
sooner
felt
himself
absolute
in
the
army
than
he
threw
off
his
obedience
to
his
sovereign
the
exhaustion
of
the
enemy
made
a
speedy
peace
probable
yet
wallenstein
continued
to
augment
the
imperial
armies
until
they
were
at
least
men
strong
numberless
commissions
to
colonelcies
and
inferior
commands
the
regal
pomp
of
the
immoderate
largesses
to
his
favourites
for
he
never
gave
less
than
a
thousand
florins
enormous
sums
lavished
in
corrupting
the
court
at
vienna
all
this
had
been
effected
without
burdening
the
emperor
these
immense
sums
were
raised
by
the
contributions
levied
from
the
lower
german
provinces
where
no
distinction
was
made
between
friend
and
foe
and
the
territories
of
all
princes
were
subjected
to
the
same
system
of
marching
and
quartering
of
extortion
and
outrage
if
credit
is
to
be
given
to
an
extravagant
contemporary
statement
wallenstein
during
his
seven
years
command
had
exacted
not
less
than
sixty
thousand
millions
of
dollars
from
one
half
of
germany
the
greater
his
extortions
the
greater
the
rewards
of
his
soldiers
and
the
greater
the
concourse
to
his
standard
for
the
world
always
follows
fortune
his
armies
flourished
while
all
the
states
through
which
they
passed
withered
what
cared
he
for
the
detestation
of
the
people
and
the
complaints
of
princes
his
army
adored
him
and
the
very
enormity
of
his
guilt
enabled
him
to
bid
defiance
to
its
consequences
it
would
be
unjust
to
ferdinand
were
we
to
lay
all
these
irregularities
to
his
charge
had
he
foreseen
that
he
was
abandoning
the
german
states
to
the
mercy
of
his
officer
he
would
have
been
sensible
how
dangerous
to
himself
so
absolute
a
general
would
prove
the
closer
the
connexion
became
between
the
army
and
the
leader
from
whom
flowed
favour
and
fortune
the
more
the
ties
which
united
both
to
the
emperor
were
relaxed
every
thing
it
is
true
was
done
in
the
name
of
the
latter
but
wallenstein
only
availed
himself
of
the
supreme
majesty
of
the
emperor
to
crush
the
authority
of
other
states
his
object
was
to
depress
the
princes
of
the
empire
to
destroy
all
gradation
of
rank
between
them
and
the
emperor
and
to
elevate
the
power
of
the
latter
above
all
competition
if
the
emperor
were
absolute
in
germany
who
then
would
be
equal
to
the
man
intrusted
with
the
execution
of
his
will
the
height
to
which
wallenstein
had
raised
the
imperial
authority
astonished
even
the
emperor
himself
but
as
the
greatness
of
the
master
was
entirely
the
work
of
the
servant
the
creation
of
wallenstein
would
necessarily
sink
again
into
nothing
upon
the
withdrawal
of
its
creative
hand
not
without
an
object
therefore
did
wallenstein
labour
to
poison
the
minds
of
the
german
princes
against
the
emperor
the
more
violent
their
hatred
of
ferdinand
the
more
indispensable
to
the
emperor
would
become
the
man
who
alone
could
render
their
powerless
his
design
unquestionably
was
that
his
sovereign
should
stand
in
fear
of
no
one
in
all
germany
besides
himself
the
source
and
engine
of
this
despotic
power
as
a
step
towards
this
end
wallenstein
now
demanded
the
cession
of
mecklenburg
to
be
held
in
pledge
till
the
repayment
of
his
advances
for
the
war
ferdinand
had
already
created
him
duke
of
friedland
apparently
with
the
view
of
exalting
his
own
general
over
bavaria
but
an
ordinary
recompense
would
not
satisfy
wallenstein
ambition
in
vain
was
this
new
demand
which
could
be
granted
only
at
the
expense
of
two
princes
of
the
empire
actively
resisted
in
the
imperial
council
in
vain
did
the
spaniards
who
had
long
been
offended
by
his
pride
oppose
his
elevation
the
powerful
support
which
wallenstein
had
purchased
from
the
imperial
councillors
prevailed
and
ferdinand
was
determined
at
whatever
cost
to
secure
the
devotion
of
so
indispensable
a
minister
for
a
slight
offence
one
of
the
oldest
german
houses
was
expelled
from
their
hereditary
dominions
that
a
creature
of
the
emperor
might
be
enriched
by
their
spoils
wallenstein
now
began
to
assume
the
title
of
generalissimo
of
the
emperor
by
sea
and
land
wismar
was
taken
and
a
firm
footing
gained
on
the
baltic
ships
were
required
from
poland
and
the
hanse
towns
to
carry
the
war
to
the
other
side
of
the
baltic
to
pursue
the
danes
into
the
heart
of
their
own
country
and
to
compel
them
to
a
peace
which
might
prepare
the
way
to
more
important
conquests
the
communication
between
the
lower
german
states
and
the
northern
powers
would
be
broken
could
the
emperor
place
himself
between
them
and
encompass
germany
from
the
adriatic
to
the
sound
the
intervening
kingdom
of
poland
being
already
dependent
on
him
with
an
unbroken
line
of
territory
if
such
was
the
emperor
plan
wallenstein
had
a
peculiar
interest
in
its
execution
these
possessions
on
the
baltic
should
he
intended
form
the
first
foundation
of
a
power
which
had
long
been
the
object
of
his
ambition
and
which
should
enable
him
to
throw
off
his
dependence
on
the
emperor
to
effect
this
object
it
was
of
extreme
importance
to
gain
possession
of
stralsund
a
town
on
the
baltic
its
excellent
harbour
and
the
short
passage
from
it
to
the
swedish
and
danish
coasts
peculiarly
fitted
it
for
a
naval
station
in
a
war
with
these
powers
this
town
the
sixth
of
the
hanseatic
league
enjoyed
great
privileges
under
the
duke
of
pomerania
and
totally
independent
of
denmark
had
taken
no
share
in
the
war
but
neither
its
neutrality
nor
its
privileges
could
protect
it
against
the
encroachments
of
wallenstein
when
he
had
once
cast
a
longing
look
upon
it
the
request
he
made
that
stralsund
should
receive
an
imperial
garrison
had
been
firmly
and
honourably
rejected
by
the
magistracy
who
also
refused
his
cunningly
demanded
permission
to
march
his
troops
through
the
town
wallenstein
therefore
now
proposed
to
besiege
it
the
independence
of
stralsund
as
securing
the
free
navigation
of
the
baltic
was
equally
important
to
the
two
northern
kings
a
common
danger
overcame
at
last
the
private
jealousies
which
had
long
divided
these
princes
in
a
treaty
concluded
at
copenhagen
in
they
bound
themselves
to
assist
stralsund
with
their
combined
force
and
to
oppose
in
common
every
foreign
power
which
should
appear
in
the
baltic
with
hostile
views
christian
iv
also
threw
a
sufficient
garrison
into
stralsund
and
by
his
personal
presence
animated
the
courage
of
the
citizens
some
ships
of
war
which
sigismund
king
of
poland
had
sent
to
the
assistance
of
the
imperial
general
were
sunk
by
the
danish
fleet
and
as
lubeck
refused
him
the
use
of
its
shipping
this
imperial
generalissimo
of
the
sea
had
not
even
ships
enough
to
blockade
this
single
harbour
nothing
could
appear
more
adventurous
than
to
attempt
the
conquest
of
a
strongly
fortified
seaport
without
first
blockading
its
harbour
wallenstein
however
who
as
yet
had
never
experienced
a
check
wished
to
conquer
nature
itself
and
to
perform
impossibilities
stralsund
open
to
the
sea
continued
to
be
supplied
with
provisions
and
reinforcements
yet
wallenstein
maintained
his
blockade
on
the
land
side
and
endeavoured
by
boasting
menaces
to
supply
his
want
of
real
strength
i
will
take
this
town
said
he
though
it
were
fastened
by
a
chain
to
the
heavens
the
emperor
himself
who
might
have
cause
to
regret
an
enterprise
which
promised
no
very
glorious
result
joyfully
availed
himself
of
the
apparent
submission
and
acceptable
propositions
of
the
inhabitants
to
order
the
general
to
retire
from
the
town
wallenstein
despised
the
command
and
continued
to
harass
the
besieged
by
incessant
assaults
as
the
danish
garrison
already
much
reduced
was
unequal
to
the
fatigues
of
this
prolonged
defence
and
the
king
was
unable
to
detach
any
further
troops
to
their
support
stralsund
with
christian
consent
threw
itself
under
the
protection
of
the
king
of
sweden
the
danish
commander
left
the
town
to
make
way
for
a
swedish
governor
who
gloriously
defended
it
here
wallenstein
good
fortune
forsook
him
and
for
the
first
time
his
pride
experienced
the
humiliation
of
relinquishing
his
prey
after
the
loss
of
many
months
and
of
men
the
necessity
to
which
he
reduced
the
town
of
applying
for
protection
to
sweden
laid
the
foundation
of
a
close
alliance
between
gustavus
adolphus
and
stralsund
which
greatly
facilitated
the
entrance
of
the
swedes
into
germany
hitherto
invariable
success
had
attended
the
arms
of
the
emperor
and
the
league
and
christian
defeated
in
germany
had
sought
refuge
in
his
own
islands
but
the
baltic
checked
the
further
progress
of
the
conquerors
the
want
of
ships
not
only
stopped
the
pursuit
of
the
king
but
endangered
their
previous
acquisitions
the
union
of
the
two
northern
monarchs
was
most
to
be
dreaded
because
so
long
as
it
lasted
it
effectually
prevented
the
emperor
and
his
general
from
acquiring
a
footing
on
the
baltic
or
effecting
a
landing
in
sweden
but
if
they
could
succeed
in
dissolving
this
union
and
especially
securing
the
friendship
of
the
danish
king
they
might
hope
to
overpower
the
insulated
force
of
sweden
the
dread
of
the
interference
of
foreign
powers
the
insubordination
of
the
protestants
in
his
own
states
and
still
more
the
storm
which
was
gradually
darkening
along
the
whole
of
protestant
germany
inclined
the
emperor
to
peace
which
his
general
from
opposite
motives
was
equally
desirous
to
effect
far
from
wishing
for
a
state
of
things
which
would
reduce
him
from
the
meridian
of
greatness
and
glory
to
the
obscurity
of
private
life
he
only
wished
to
change
the
theatre
of
war
and
by
a
partial
peace
to
prolong
the
general
confusion
the
friendship
of
denmark
whose
neighbour
he
had
become
as
duke
of
mecklenburgh
was
most
important
for
the
success
of
his
ambitious
views
and
he
resolved
even
at
the
sacrifice
of
his
sovereign
interests
to
secure
its
alliance
by
the
treaty
of
copenhagen
christian
iv
had
expressly
engaged
not
to
conclude
a
separate
peace
with
the
emperor
without
the
consent
of
sweden
notwithstanding
wallenstein
proposition
was
readily
received
by
him
in
a
conference
at
lubeck
in
from
which
wallenstein
with
studied
contempt
excluded
the
swedish
ambassadors
who
came
to
intercede
for
mecklenburgh
all
the
conquests
taken
by
the
imperialists
were
restored
to
the
danes
the
conditions
imposed
upon
the
king
were
that
he
should
interfere
no
farther
with
the
affairs
of
germany
than
was
called
for
by
his
character
of
duke
of
holstein
that
he
should
on
no
pretext
harass
the
chapters
of
lower
germany
and
should
leave
the
dukes
of
mecklenburgh
to
their
fate
by
christian
himself
had
these
princes
been
involved
in
the
war
with
the
emperor
he
now
sacrificed
them
to
gain
the
favour
of
the
usurper
of
their
territories
among
the
motives
which
had
engaged
him
in
a
war
with
the
emperor
not
the
least
was
the
restoration
of
his
relation
the
elector
palatine
yet
the
name
of
that
unfortunate
prince
was
not
even
mentioned
in
the
treaty
while
in
one
of
its
articles
the
legitimacy
of
the
bavarian
election
was
expressly
recognised
thus
meanly
and
ingloriously
did
christian
iv
retire
from
the
field
ferdinand
had
it
now
in
his
power
for
the
second
time
to
secure
the
tranquillity
of
germany
and
it
depended
solely
on
his
will
whether
the
treaty
with
denmark
should
or
should
not
be
the
basis
of
a
general
peace
from
every
quarter
arose
the
cry
of
the
unfortunate
petitioning
for
an
end
of
their
sufferings
the
cruelties
of
his
soldiers
and
the
rapacity
of
his
generals
had
exceeded
all
bounds
germany
laid
waste
by
the
desolating
bands
of
mansfeld
and
the
duke
of
brunswick
and
by
the
still
more
terrible
hordes
of
tilly
and
wallenstein
lay
exhausted
bleeding
wasted
and
sighing
for
repose
an
anxious
desire
for
peace
was
felt
by
all
conditions
and
by
the
emperor
himself
involved
as
he
was
in
a
war
with
france
in
upper
italy
exhausted
by
his
past
warfare
in
germany
and
apprehensive
of
the
day
of
reckoning
which
was
approaching
but
unfortunately
the
conditions
on
which
alone
the
two
religious
parties
were
willing
respectively
to
sheath
the
sword
were
irreconcileable
the
roman
catholics
wished
to
terminate
the
war
to
their
own
advantage
the
protestants
advanced
equal
pretensions
the
emperor
instead
of
uniting
both
parties
by
a
prudent
moderation
sided
with
one
and
thus
germany
was
again
plunged
in
the
horrors
of
a
bloody
war
from
the
very
close
of
the
bohemian
troubles
ferdinand
had
carried
on
a
counter
reformation
in
his
hereditary
dominions
in
which
however
from
regard
to
some
of
the
protestant
estates
he
proceeded
at
first
with
moderation
but
the
victories
of
his
generals
in
lower
germany
encouraged
him
to
throw
off
all
reserve
accordingly
he
had
it
intimated
to
all
the
protestants
in
these
dominions
that
they
must
either
abandon
their
religion
or
their
native
country
a
bitter
and
dreadful
alternative
which
excited
the
most
violent
commotions
among
his
austrian
subjects
in
the
palatinate
immediately
after
the
expulsion
of
frederick
the
protestant
religion
had
been
suppressed
and
its
professors
expelled
from
the
university
of
heidelberg
all
this
was
but
the
prelude
to
greater
changes
in
the
electoral
congress
held
at
muehlhausen
the
roman
catholics
had
demanded
of
the
emperor
that
all
the
archbishoprics
bishoprics
mediate
and
immediate
abbacies
and
monasteries
which
since
the
diet
of
augsburg
had
been
secularized
by
the
protestants
should
be
restored
to
the
church
in
order
to
indemnify
them
for
the
losses
and
sufferings
in
the
war
to
a
roman
catholic
prince
so
zealous
as
ferdinand
was
such
a
hint
was
not
likely
to
be
neglected
but
he
still
thought
it
would
be
premature
to
arouse
the
whole
protestants
of
germany
by
so
decisive
a
step
not
a
single
protestant
prince
but
would
be
deprived
by
this
revocation
of
the
religious
foundations
of
a
part
of
his
lands
for
where
these
revenues
had
not
actually
been
diverted
to
secular
purposes
they
had
been
made
over
to
the
protestant
church
to
this
source
many
princes
owed
the
chief
part
of
their
revenues
and
importance
all
without
exception
would
be
irritated
by
this
demand
for
restoration
the
religious
treaty
did
not
expressly
deny
their
right
to
these
chapters
although
it
did
not
allow
it
but
a
possession
which
had
now
been
held
for
nearly
a
century
the
silence
of
four
preceding
emperors
and
the
law
of
equity
which
gave
them
an
equal
right
with
the
roman
catholics
to
the
foundations
of
their
common
ancestors
might
be
strongly
pleaded
by
them
as
a
valid
title
besides
the
actual
loss
of
power
and
authority
which
the
surrender
of
these
foundations
would
occasion
besides
the
inevitable
confusion
which
would
necessarily
attend
it
one
important
disadvantage
to
which
it
would
lead
was
that
the
restoration
of
the
roman
catholic
bishops
would
increase
the
strength
of
that
party
in
the
diet
by
so
many
additional
votes
such
grievous
sacrifices
likely
to
fall
on
the
protestants
made
the
emperor
apprehensive
of
a
formidable
opposition
and
until
the
military
ardour
should
have
cooled
in
germany
he
had
no
wish
to
provoke
a
party
formidable
by
its
union
and
which
in
the
elector
of
saxony
had
a
powerful
leader
he
resolved
therefore
to
try
the
experiment
at
first
on
a
small
scale
in
order
to
ascertain
how
it
was
likely
to
succeed
on
a
larger
one
accordingly
some
of
the
free
cities
in
upper
germany
and
the
duke
of
wirtemberg
received
orders
to
surrender
to
the
roman
catholics
several
of
the
confiscated
chapters
the
state
of
affairs
in
saxony
enabled
the
emperor
to
make
some
bolder
experiments
in
that
quarter
in
the
bishoprics
of
magdeburg
and
halberstadt
the
protestant
canons
had
not
hesitated
to
elect
bishops
of
their
own
religion
both
bishoprics
with
the
exception
of
the
town
of
magdeburg
itself
were
overrun
by
the
troops
of
wallenstein
it
happened
moreover
that
by
the
death
of
the
administrator
duke
christian
of
brunswick
halberstadt
was
vacant
as
was
also
the
archbishopric
of
magdeburg
by
the
deposition
of
christian
william
a
prince
of
the
house
of
brandenburgh
ferdinand
took
advantage
of
the
circumstance
to
restore
the
see
of
halberstadt
to
a
roman
catholic
bishop
and
a
prince
of
his
own
house
to
avoid
a
similar
coercion
the
chapter
of
magdeburg
hastened
to
elect
a
son
of
the
elector
of
saxony
as
archbishop
but
the
pope
who
with
his
arrogated
authority
interfered
in
this
matter
conferred
the
archbishopric
of
magdeburg
also
on
the
austrian
prince
thus
with
all
his
pious
zeal
for
religion
ferdinand
never
lost
sight
of
the
interests
of
his
family
at
length
when
the
peace
of
lubeck
had
delivered
the
emperor
from
all
apprehensions
on
the
side
of
denmark
and
the
german
protestants
seemed
entirely
powerless
the
league
becoming
louder
and
more
urgent
in
its
demands
ferdinand
in
signed
the
edict
of
restitution
so
famous
by
its
disastrous
consequences
which
he
had
previously
laid
before
the
four
roman
catholic
electors
for
their
approbation
in
the
preamble
he
claimed
the
prerogative
in
right
of
his
imperial
authority
to
interpret
the
meaning
of
the
religious
treaty
the
ambiguities
of
which
had
already
caused
so
many
disputes
and
to
decide
as
supreme
arbiter
and
judge
between
the
contending
parties
this
prerogative
he
founded
upon
the
practice
of
his
ancestors
and
its
previous
recognition
even
by
protestant
states
saxony
had
actually
acknowledged
this
right
of
the
emperor
and
it
now
became
evident
how
deeply
this
court
had
injured
the
protestant
cause
by
its
dependence
on
the
house
of
austria
but
though
the
meaning
of
the
religious
treaty
was
really
ambiguous
as
a
century
of
religious
disputes
sufficiently
proved
yet
for
the
emperor
who
must
be
either
a
protestant
or
a
roman
catholic
and
therefore
an
interested
party
to
assume
the
right
of
deciding
between
the
disputants
was
clearly
a
violation
of
an
essential
article
of
the
pacification
he
could
not
be
judge
in
his
own
cause
without
reducing
the
liberties
of
the
empire
to
an
empty
sound
and
now
in
virtue
of
this
usurpation
ferdinand
decided
that
every
secularization
of
a
religious
foundation
mediate
or
immediate
by
the
protestants
subsequent
to
the
date
of
the
treaty
was
contrary
to
its
spirit
and
must
be
revoked
as
a
breach
of
it
he
further
decided
that
by
the
religious
peace
catholic
proprietors
of
estates
were
no
further
bound
to
their
protestant
subjects
than
to
allow
them
full
liberty
to
quit
their
territories
in
obedience
to
this
decision
all
unlawful
possessors
of
benefices
the
protestant
states
in
short
without
exception
were
ordered
under
pain
of
the
ban
of
the
empire
immediately
to
surrender
their
usurped
possessions
to
the
imperial
commissioners
this
sentence
applied
to
no
less
than
two
archbishoprics
and
twelve
bishoprics
besides
innumerable
abbacies
the
edict
came
like
a
thunderbolt
on
the
whole
of
protestant
germany
dreadful
even
in
its
immediate
consequences
but
yet
more
so
from
the
further
calamities
it
seemed
to
threaten
the
protestants
were
now
convinced
that
the
suppression
of
their
religion
had
been
resolved
on
by
the
emperor
and
the
league
and
that
the
overthrow
of
german
liberty
would
soon
follow
their
remonstrances
were
unheeded
the
commissioners
were
named
and
an
army
assembled
to
enforce
obedience
the
edict
was
first
put
in
force
in
augsburg
where
the
treaty
was
concluded
the
city
was
again
placed
under
the
government
of
its
bishop
and
six
protestant
churches
in
the
town
were
closed
the
duke
of
wirtemberg
was
in
like
manner
compelled
to
surrender
his
abbacies
these
severe
measures
though
they
alarmed
the
protestant
states
were
yet
insufficient
to
rouse
them
to
an
active
resistance
their
fear
of
the
emperor
was
too
strong
and
many
were
disposed
to
quiet
submission
the
hope
of
attaining
their
end
by
gentle
measures
induced
the
roman
catholics
likewise
to
delay
for
a
year
the
execution
of
the
edict
and
this
saved
the
protestants
before
the
end
of
that
period
the
success
of
the
swedish
arms
had
totally
changed
the
state
of
affairs
in
a
diet
held
at
ratisbon
at
which
ferdinand
was
present
in
person
in
the
necessity
of
taking
some
measures
for
the
immediate
restoration
of
a
general
peace
to
germany
and
for
the
removal
of
all
grievances
was
debated
the
complaints
of
the
roman
catholics
were
scarcely
less
numerous
than
those
of
the
protestants
although
ferdinand
had
flattered
himself
that
by
the
edict
of
restitution
he
had
secured
the
members
of
the
league
and
its
leader
by
the
gift
of
the
electoral
dignity
and
the
cession
of
great
part
of
the
palatinate
but
the
good
understanding
between
the
emperor
and
the
princes
of
the
league
had
rapidly
declined
since
the
employment
of
wallenstein
accustomed
to
give
law
to
germany
and
even
to
sway
the
emperor
own
destiny
the
haughty
elector
of
bavaria
now
at
once
saw
himself
supplanted
by
the
imperial
general
and
with
that
of
the
league
his
own
importance
completely
undermined
another
had
now
stepped
in
to
reap
the
fruits
of
his
victories
and
to
bury
his
past
services
in
oblivion
wallenstein
imperious
character
whose
dearest
triumph
was
in
degrading
the
authority
of
the
princes
and
giving
an
odious
latitude
to
that
of
the
emperor
tended
not
a
little
to
augment
the
irritation
of
the
elector
discontented
with
the
emperor
and
distrustful
of
his
intentions
he
had
entered
into
an
alliance
with
france
which
the
other
members
of
the
league
were
suspected
of
favouring
a
fear
of
the
emperor
plans
of
aggrandizement
and
discontent
with
existing
evils
had
extinguished
among
them
all
feelings
of
gratitude
wallenstein
exactions
had
become
altogether
intolerable
brandenburg
estimated
its
losses
at
twenty
pomerania
at
ten
hesse
cassel
at
seven
millions
of
dollars
and
the
rest
in
proportion
the
cry
for
redress
was
loud
urgent
and
universal
all
prejudices
were
hushed
roman
catholics
and
protestants
were
united
on
this
point
the
terrified
emperor
was
assailed
on
all
sides
by
petitions
against
wallenstein
and
his
ear
filled
with
the
most
fearful
descriptions
of
his
outrages
ferdinand
was
not
naturally
cruel
if
not
totally
innocent
of
the
atrocities
which
were
practised
in
germany
under
the
shelter
of
his
name
he
was
ignorant
of
their
extent
and
he
was
not
long
in
yielding
to
the
representation
of
the
princes
and
reduced
his
standing
army
by
eighteen
thousand
cavalry
while
this
reduction
took
place
the
swedes
were
actively
preparing
an
expedition
into
germany
and
the
greater
part
of
the
disbanded
imperialists
enlisted
under
their
banners
the
emperor
concessions
only
encouraged
the
elector
of
bavaria
to
bolder
demands
so
long
as
the
duke
of
friedland
retained
the
supreme
command
his
triumph
over
the
emperor
was
incomplete
the
princes
of
the
league
were
meditating
a
severe
revenge
on
wallenstein
for
that
haughtiness
with
which
he
had
treated
them
all
alike
his
dismissal
was
demanded
by
the
whole
college
of
electors
and
even
by
spain
with
a
degree
of
unanimity
and
urgency
which
astonished
the
emperor
the
anxiety
with
which
wallenstein
enemies
pressed
for
his
dismissal
ought
to
have
convinced
the
emperor
of
the
importance
of
his
services
wallenstein
informed
of
the
cabals
which
were
forming
against
him
in
ratisbon
lost
no
time
in
opening
the
eyes
of
the
emperor
to
the
real
views
of
the
elector
of
bavaria
he
himself
appeared
in
ratisbon
with
a
pomp
which
threw
his
master
into
the
shade
and
increased
the
hatred
of
his
opponents
long
was
the
emperor
undecided
the
sacrifice
demanded
was
a
painful
one
to
the
duke
of
friedland
alone
he
owed
his
preponderance
he
felt
how
much
he
would
lose
in
yielding
him
to
the
indignation
of
the
princes
but
at
this
moment
unfortunately
he
was
under
the
necessity
of
conciliating
the
electors
his
son
ferdinand
had
already
been
chosen
king
of
hungary
and
he
was
endeavouring
to
procure
his
election
as
his
successor
in
the
empire
for
this
purpose
the
support
of
maximilian
was
indispensable
this
consideration
was
the
weightiest
and
to
oblige
the
elector
of
bavaria
he
scrupled
not
to
sacrifice
his
most
valuable
servant
at
the
diet
at
ratisbon
there
were
present
ambassadors
from
france
empowered
to
adjust
the
differences
which
seemed
to
menace
a
war
in
italy
between
the
emperor
and
their
sovereign
vincent
duke
of
mantua
and
montferrat
dying
without
issue
his
next
relation
charles
duke
of
nevers
had
taken
possession
of
this
inheritance
without
doing
homage
to
the
emperor
as
liege
lord
of
the
principality
encouraged
by
the
support
of
france
and
venice
he
refused
to
surrender
these
territories
into
the
hands
of
the
imperial
commissioners
until
his
title
to
them
should
be
decided
on
the
other
hand
ferdinand
had
taken
up
arms
at
the
instigation
of
the
spaniards
to
whom
as
possessors
of
milan
the
near
neighbourhood
of
a
vassal
of
france
was
peculiarly
alarming
and
who
welcomed
this
prospect
of
making
with
the
assistance
of
the
emperor
additional
conquests
in
italy
in
spite
of
all
the
exertions
of
pope
urban
viii
to
avert
a
war
in
that
country
ferdinand
marched
a
german
army
across
the
alps
and
threw
the
italian
states
into
a
general
consternation
his
arms
had
been
successful
throughout
germany
and
exaggerated
fears
revived
the
olden
apprehension
of
austria
projects
of
universal
monarchy
all
the
horrors
of
the
german
war
now
spread
like
a
deluge
over
those
favoured
countries
which
the
po
waters
mantua
was
taken
by
storm
and
the
surrounding
districts
given
up
to
the
ravages
of
a
lawless
soldiery
the
curse
of
italy
was
thus
added
to
the
maledictions
upon
the
emperor
which
resounded
through
germany
and
even
in
the
roman
conclave
silent
prayers
were
offered
for
the
success
of
the
protestant
arms
alarmed
by
the
universal
hatred
which
this
italian
campaign
had
drawn
upon
him
and
wearied
out
by
the
urgent
remonstrances
of
the
electors
who
zealously
supported
the
application
of
the
french
ambassador
the
emperor
promised
the
investiture
to
the
new
duke
of
mantua
this
important
service
on
the
part
of
bavaria
of
course
required
an
equivalent
from
france
the
adjustment
of
the
treaty
gave
the
envoys
of
richelieu
during
their
residence
in
ratisbon
the
desired
opportunity
of
entangling
the
emperor
in
dangerous
intrigues
of
inflaming
the
discontented
princes
of
the
league
still
more
strongly
against
him
and
of
turning
to
his
disadvantage
all
the
transactions
of
the
diet
for
this
purpose
richelieu
had
chosen
an
admirable
instrument
in
father
joseph
a
capuchin
friar
who
accompanied
the
ambassadors
without
exciting
the
least
suspicion
one
of
his
principal
instructions
was
assiduously
to
bring
about
the
dismissal
of
wallenstein
with
the
general
who
had
led
it
to
victory
the
army
of
austria
would
lose
its
principal
strength
many
armies
could
not
compensate
for
the
loss
of
this
individual
it
would
therefore
be
a
masterstroke
of
policy
at
the
very
moment
when
a
victorious
monarch
the
absolute
master
of
his
operations
was
arming
against
the
emperor
to
remove
from
the
head
of
the
imperial
armies
the
only
general
who
by
ability
and
military
experience
was
able
to
cope
with
the
french
king
father
joseph
in
the
interests
of
bavaria
undertook
to
overcome
the
irresolution
of
the
emperor
who
was
now
in
a
manner
besieged
by
the
spaniards
and
the
electoral
council
it
would
be
expedient
he
thought
to
gratify
the
electors
on
this
occasion
and
thereby
facilitate
his
son
election
to
the
roman
crown
this
object
once
gained
wallenstein
could
at
any
time
resume
his
former
station
the
artful
capuchin
was
too
sure
of
his
man
to
touch
upon
this
ground
of
consolation
the
voice
of
a
monk
was
to
ferdinand
ii
the
voice
of
god
nothing
on
earth
writes
his
own
confessor
was
more
sacred
in
his
eyes
than
a
priest
if
it
could
happen
he
used
to
say
that
an
angel
and
a
regular
were
to
meet
him
at
the
same
time
and
place
the
regular
should
receive
his
first
and
the
angel
his
second
obeisance
wallenstein
dismissal
was
determined
upon
in
return
for
this
pious
concession
the
capuchin
dexterously
counteracted
the
emperor
scheme
to
procure
for
the
king
of
hungary
the
further
dignity
of
king
of
the
romans
in
an
express
clause
of
the
treaty
just
concluded
the
french
ministers
engaged
in
the
name
of
their
sovereign
to
observe
a
complete
neutrality
between
the
emperor
and
his
enemies
while
at
the
same
time
richelieu
was
actually
negociating
with
the
king
of
sweden
to
declare
war
and
pressing
upon
him
the
alliance
of
his
master
the
latter
indeed
disavowed
the
lie
as
soon
as
it
had
served
its
purpose
and
father
joseph
confined
to
a
convent
must
atone
for
the
alleged
offence
of
exceeding
his
instructions
ferdinand
perceived
when
too
late
that
he
had
been
imposed
upon
a
wicked
capuchin
he
was
heard
to
say
has
disarmed
me
with
his
rosary
and
thrust
nothing
less
than
six
electoral
crowns
into
his
cowl
artifice
and
trickery
thus
triumphed
over
the
emperor
at
the
moment
when
he
was
believed
to
be
omnipotent
in
germany
and
actually
was
so
in
the
field
with
the
loss
of
men
and
of
a
general
who
alone
was
worth
whole
armies
he
left
ratisbon
without
gaining
the
end
for
which
he
had
made
such
sacrifices
before
the
swedes
had
vanquished
him
in
the
field
maximilian
of
bavaria
and
father
joseph
had
given
him
a
mortal
blow
at
this
memorable
diet
at
ratisbon
the
war
with
sweden
was
resolved
upon
and
that
of
mantua
terminated
vainly
had
the
princes
present
at
it
interceded
for
the
dukes
of
mecklenburgh
and
equally
fruitless
had
been
an
application
by
the
english
ambassadors
for
a
pension
to
the
palatine
frederick
wallenstein
was
at
the
head
of
an
army
of
nearly
a
hundred
thousand
men
who
adored
him
when
the
sentence
of
his
dismissal
arrived
most
of
the
officers
were
his
creatures
with
the
common
soldiers
his
hint
was
law
his
ambition
was
boundless
his
pride
indomitable
his
imperious
spirit
could
not
brook
an
injury
unavenged
one
moment
would
now
precipitate
him
from
the
height
of
grandeur
into
the
obscurity
of
a
private
station
to
execute
such
a
sentence
upon
such
a
delinquent
seemed
to
require
more
address
than
it
cost
to
obtain
it
from
the
judge
accordingly
two
of
wallenstein
most
intimate
friends
were
selected
as
heralds
of
these
evil
tidings
and
instructed
to
soften
them
as
much
as
possible
by
flattering
assurances
of
the
continuance
of
the
emperor
favour
wallenstein
had
ascertained
the
purport
of
their
message
before
the
imperial
ambassadors
arrived
he
had
time
to
collect
himself
and
his
countenance
exhibited
an
external
calmness
while
grief
and
rage
were
storming
in
his
bosom
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
obey
the
emperor
decision
had
taken
him
by
surprise
before
circumstances
were
ripe
or
his
preparations
complete
for
the
bold
measures
he
had
contemplated
his
extensive
estates
were
scattered
over
bohemia
and
moravia
and
by
their
confiscation
the
emperor
might
at
once
destroy
the
sinews
of
his
power
he
looked
therefore
to
the
future
for
revenge
and
in
this
hope
he
was
encouraged
by
the
predictions
of
an
italian
astrologer
who
led
his
imperious
spirit
like
a
child
in
leading
strings
seni
had
read
in
the
stars
that
his
brilliant
career
was
not
yet
ended
and
that
bright
and
glorious
prospects
still
awaited
him
it
was
indeed
unnecessary
to
consult
the
stars
to
foretell
that
an
enemy
gustavus
adolphus
would
ere
long
render
indispensable
the
services
of
such
a
general
as
wallenstein
the
emperor
is
betrayed
said
wallenstein
to
the
messengers
i
pity
but
forgive
him
it
is
plain
that
the
grasping
spirit
of
the
bavarian
dictates
to
him
i
grieve
that
with
so
much
weakness
he
has
sacrificed
me
but
i
will
obey
he
dismissed
the
emissaries
with
princely
presents
and
in
a
humble
letter
besought
the
continuance
of
the
emperor
favour
and
of
the
dignities
he
had
bestowed
upon
him
the
murmurs
of
the
army
were
universal
on
hearing
of
the
dismissal
of
their
general
and
the
greater
part
of
his
officers
immediately
quitted
the
imperial
service
many
followed
him
to
his
estates
in
bohemia
and
moravia
others
he
attached
to
his
interests
by
pensions
in
order
to
command
their
services
when
the
opportunity
should
offer
but
repose
was
the
last
thing
that
wallenstein
contemplated
when
he
returned
to
private
life
in
his
retreat
he
surrounded
himself
with
a
regal
pomp
which
seemed
to
mock
the
sentence
of
degradation
six
gates
led
to
the
palace
he
inhabited
in
prague
and
a
hundred
houses
were
pulled
down
to
make
way
for
his
courtyard
similar
palaces
were
built
on
his
other
numerous
estates
gentlemen
of
the
noblest
houses
contended
for
the
honour
of
serving
him
and
even
imperial
chamberlains
resigned
the
golden
key
to
the
emperor
to
fill
a
similar
office
under
wallenstein
he
maintained
sixty
pages
who
were
instructed
by
the
ablest
masters
his
antichamber
was
protected
by
fifty
life
guards
his
table
never
consisted
of
less
than
covers
and
his
seneschal
was
a
person
of
distinction
when
he
travelled
his
baggage
and
suite
accompanied
him
in
a
hundred
wagons
drawn
by
six
or
four
horses
his
court
followed
in
sixty
carriages
attended
by
fifty
led
horses
the
pomp
of
his
liveries
the
splendour
of
his
equipages
and
the
decorations
of
his
apartments
were
in
keeping
with
all
the
rest
six
barons
and
as
many
knights
were
in
constant
attendance
about
his
person
and
ready
to
execute
his
slightest
order
twelve
patrols
went
their
rounds
about
his
palace
to
prevent
any
disturbance
his
busy
genius
required
silence
the
noise
of
coaches
was
to
be
kept
away
from
his
residence
and
the
streets
leading
to
it
were
frequently
blocked
up
with
chains
his
own
circle
was
as
silent
as
the
approaches
to
his
palace
dark
reserved
and
impenetrable
he
was
more
sparing
of
his
words
than
of
his
gifts
while
the
little
that
he
spoke
was
harsh
and
imperious
he
never
smiled
and
the
coldness
of
his
temperament
was
proof
against
sensual
seductions
ever
occupied
with
grand
schemes
he
despised
all
those
idle
amusements
in
which
so
many
waste
their
lives
the
correspondence
he
kept
up
with
the
whole
of
europe
was
chiefly
managed
by
himself
and
that
as
little
as
possible
might
be
trusted
to
the
silence
of
others
most
of
the
letters
were
written
by
his
own
hand
he
was
a
man
of
large
stature
thin
of
a
sallow
complexion
with
short
red
hair
and
small
sparkling
eyes
a
gloomy
and
forbidding
seriousness
sat
upon
his
brow
and
his
magnificent
presents
alone
retained
the
trembling
crowd
of
his
dependents
in
this
stately
obscurity
did
wallenstein
silently
but
not
inactively
await
the
hour
of
revenge
the
victorious
career
of
gustavus
adolphus
soon
gave
him
a
presentiment
of
its
approach
not
one
of
his
lofty
schemes
had
been
abandoned
and
the
emperor
ingratitude
had
loosened
the
curb
of
his
ambition
the
dazzling
splendour
of
his
private
life
bespoke
high
soaring
projects
and
lavish
as
a
king
he
seemed
already
to
reckon
among
his
certain
possessions
those
which
he
contemplated
with
hope
after
wallenstein
dismissal
and
the
invasion
of
gustavus
adolphus
a
new
generalissimo
was
to
be
appointed
and
it
now
appeared
advisable
to
unite
both
the
imperial
army
and
that
of
the
league
under
one
general
maximilian
of
bavaria
sought
this
appointment
which
would
have
enabled
him
to
dictate
to
the
emperor
who
from
a
conviction
of
this
wished
to
procure
the
command
for
his
eldest
son
the
king
of
hungary
at
last
in
order
to
avoid
offence
to
either
of
the
competitors
the
appointment
was
given
to
tilly
who
now
exchanged
the
bavarian
for
the
austrian
service
the
imperial
army
in
germany
after
the
retirement
of
wallenstein
amounted
to
about
men
that
of
the
league
to
nearly
the
same
number
both
commanded
by
excellent
officers
trained
by
the
experience
of
several
campaigns
and
proud
of
a
long
series
of
victories
with
such
a
force
little
apprehension
was
felt
at
the
invasion
of
the
king
of
sweden
and
the
less
so
as
it
commanded
both
pomerania
and
mecklenburg
the
only
countries
through
which
he
could
enter
germany
after
the
unsuccessful
attempt
of
the
king
of
denmark
to
check
the
emperor
progress
gustavus
adolphus
was
the
only
prince
in
europe
from
whom
oppressed
liberty
could
look
for
protection
the
only
one
who
while
he
was
personally
qualified
to
conduct
such
an
enterprise
had
both
political
motives
to
recommend
and
wrongs
to
justify
it
before
the
commencement
of
the
war
in
lower
saxony
important
political
interests
induced
him
as
well
as
the
king
of
denmark
to
offer
his
services
and
his
army
for
the
defence
of
germany
but
the
offer
of
the
latter
had
to
his
own
misfortune
been
preferred
since
that
time
wallenstein
and
the
emperor
had
adopted
measures
which
must
have
been
equally
offensive
to
him
as
a
man
and
as
a
king
imperial
troops
had
been
despatched
to
the
aid
of
the
polish
king
sigismund
to
defend
prussia
against
the
swedes
when
the
king
complained
to
wallenstein
of
this
act
of
hostility
he
received
for
answer
the
emperor
has
more
soldiers
than
he
wants
for
himself
he
must
help
his
friends
the
swedish
ambassadors
had
been
insolently
ordered
by
wallenstein
to
withdraw
from
the
conference
at
lubeck
and
when
unawed
by
this
command
they
were
courageous
enough
to
remain
contrary
to
the
law
of
nations
he
had
threatened
them
with
violence
ferdinand
had
also
insulted
the
swedish
flag
and
intercepted
the
king
despatches
to
transylvania
he
also
threw
every
obstacle
in
the
way
of
a
peace
betwixt
poland
and
sweden
supported
the
pretensions
of
sigismund
to
the
swedish
throne
and
denied
the
right
of
gustavus
to
the
title
of
king
deigning
no
regard
to
the
repeated
remonstrances
of
gustavus
he
rather
aggravated
the
offence
by
new
grievances
than
acceded
the
required
satisfaction
so
many
personal
motives
supported
by
important
considerations
both
of
policy
and
religion
and
seconded
by
pressing
invitations
from
germany
had
their
full
weight
with
a
prince
who
was
naturally
the
more
jealous
of
his
royal
prerogative
the
more
it
was
questioned
who
was
flattered
by
the
glory
he
hoped
to
gain
as
protector
of
the
oppressed
and
passionately
loved
war
as
the
element
of
his
genius
but
until
a
truce
or
peace
with
poland
should
set
his
hands
free
a
new
and
dangerous
war
was
not
to
be
thought
of
cardinal
richelieu
had
the
merit
of
effecting
this
truce
with
poland
this
great
statesman
who
guided
the
helm
of
europe
while
in
france
he
repressed
the
rage
of
faction
and
the
insolence
of
the
nobles
pursued
steadily
amidst
the
cares
of
a
stormy
administration
his
plan
of
lowering
the
ascendancy
of
the
house
of
austria
but
circumstances
opposed
considerable
obstacles
to
the
execution
of
his
designs
and
even
the
greatest
minds
can
not
with
impunity
defy
the
prejudices
of
the
age
the
minister
of
a
roman
catholic
king
and
a
cardinal
he
was
prevented
by
the
purple
he
bore
from
joining
the
enemies
of
that
church
in
an
open
attack
on
a
power
which
had
the
address
to
sanctify
its
ambitious
encroachments
under
the
name
of
religion
the
external
deference
which
richelieu
was
obliged
to
pay
to
the
narrow
views
of
his
contemporaries
limited
his
exertions
to
secret
negociations
by
which
he
endeavoured
to
gain
the
hand
of
others
to
accomplish
the
enlightened
projects
of
his
own
mind
after
a
fruitless
attempt
to
prevent
the
peace
between
denmark
and
the
emperor
he
had
recourse
to
gustavus
adolphus
the
hero
of
his
age
no
exertion
was
spared
to
bring
this
monarch
to
a
favourable
decision
and
at
the
same
time
to
facilitate
the
execution
of
it
charnasse
an
unsuspected
agent
of
the
cardinal
proceeded
to
polish
prussia
where
gustavus
adolphus
was
conducting
the
war
against
sigismund
and
alternately
visited
these
princes
in
order
to
persuade
them
to
a
truce
or
peace
gustavus
had
been
long
inclined
to
it
and
the
french
minister
succeeded
at
last
in
opening
the
eyes
of
sigismund
to
his
true
interests
and
to
the
deceitful
policy
of
the
emperor
a
truce
for
six
years
was
agreed
on
gustavus
being
allowed
to
retain
all
his
conquests
this
treaty
gave
him
also
what
he
had
so
long
desired
the
liberty
of
directing
his
arms
against
the
emperor
for
this
the
french
ambassador
offered
him
the
alliance
of
his
sovereign
and
considerable
subsidies
but
gustavus
adolphus
was
justly
apprehensive
lest
the
acceptance
of
the
assistance
should
make
him
dependent
upon
france
and
fetter
him
in
his
career
of
conquest
while
an
alliance
with
a
roman
catholic
power
might
excite
distrust
among
the
protestants
if
the
war
was
just
and
necessary
the
circumstances
under
which
it
was
undertaken
were
not
less
promising
the
name
of
the
emperor
it
is
true
was
formidable
his
resources
inexhaustible
his
power
hitherto
invincible
so
dangerous
a
contest
would
have
dismayed
any
other
than
gustavus
he
saw
all
the
obstacles
and
dangers
which
opposed
his
undertaking
but
he
knew
also
the
means
by
which
as
he
hoped
they
might
be
conquered
his
army
though
not
numerous
was
well
disciplined
inured
to
hardship
by
a
severe
climate
and
campaigns
and
trained
to
victory
in
the
war
with
poland
sweden
though
poor
in
men
and
money
and
overtaxed
by
an
eight
years
war
was
devoted
to
its
monarch
with
an
enthusiasm
which
assured
him
of
the
ready
support
of
his
subjects
in
germany
the
name
of
the
emperor
was
at
least
as
much
hated
as
feared
the
protestant
princes
only
awaited
the
arrival
of
a
deliverer
to
throw
off
his
intolerable
yoke
and
openly
declare
for
the
swedes
even
the
roman
catholic
states
would
welcome
an
antagonist
to
the
emperor
whose
opposition
might
control
his
overwhelming
influence
the
first
victory
gained
on
german
ground
would
be
decisive
it
would
encourage
those
princes
who
still
hesitated
to
declare
themselves
strengthen
the
cause
of
his
adherents
augment
his
troops
and
open
resources
for
the
maintenance
of
the
campaign
if
the
greater
part
of
the
german
states
were
impoverished
by
oppression
the
flourishing
hanse
towns
had
escaped
and
they
could
not
hesitate
by
a
small
voluntary
sacrifice
to
avert
the
general
ruin
as
the
imperialists
should
be
driven
from
the
different
provinces
their
armies
would
diminish
since
they
were
subsisting
on
the
countries
in
which
they
were
encamped
the
strength
too
of
the
emperor
had
been
lessened
by
detachments
to
italy
and
the
netherlands
while
spain
weakened
by
the
loss
of
the
manilla
galleons
and
engaged
in
a
serious
war
in
the
netherlands
could
afford
him
little
support
great
britain
on
the
other
hand
gave
the
king
of
sweden
hope
of
considerable
subsidies
and
france
now
at
peace
with
itself
came
forward
with
the
most
favourable
offers
but
the
strongest
pledge
for
the
success
of
his
undertaking
gustavus
found
in
himself
prudence
demanded
that
he
should
embrace
all
the
foreign
assistance
he
could
in
order
to
guard
his
enterprise
from
the
imputation
of
rashness
but
all
his
confidence
and
courage
were
entirely
derived
from
himself
he
was
indisputably
the
greatest
general
of
his
age
and
the
bravest
soldier
in
the
army
which
he
had
formed
familiar
with
the
tactics
of
greece
and
rome
he
had
discovered
a
more
effective
system
of
warfare
which
was
adopted
as
a
model
by
the
most
eminent
commanders
of
subsequent
times
he
reduced
the
unwieldy
squadrons
of
cavalry
and
rendered
their
movements
more
light
and
rapid
and
with
the
same
view
he
widened
the
intervals
between
his
battalions
instead
of
the
usual
array
in
a
single
line
he
disposed
his
forces
in
two
lines
that
the
second
might
advance
in
the
event
of
the
first
giving
way
he
made
up
for
his
want
of
cavalry
by
placing
infantry
among
the
horse
a
practice
which
frequently
decided
the
victory
europe
first
learned
from
him
the
importance
of
infantry
all
germany
was
astonished
at
the
strict
discipline
which
at
the
first
so
creditably
distinguished
the
swedish
army
within
their
territories
all
disorders
were
punished
with
the
utmost
severity
particularly
impiety
theft
gambling
and
duelling
the
swedish
articles
of
war
enforced
frugality
in
the
camp
the
king
tent
not
excepted
neither
silver
nor
gold
was
to
be
seen
the
general
eye
looked
as
vigilantly
to
the
morals
as
to
the
martial
bravery
of
his
soldiers
every
regiment
was
ordered
to
form
round
its
chaplain
for
morning
and
evening
prayers
in
all
these
points
the
lawgiver
was
also
an
example
a
sincere
and
ardent
piety
exalted
his
courage
equally
free
from
the
coarse
infidelity
which
leaves
the
passions
of
the
barbarian
without
a
control
and
from
the
grovelling
superstition
of
ferdinand
who
humbled
himself
to
the
dust
before
the
supreme
being
while
he
haughtily
trampled
on
his
in
the
height
of
his
success
he
was
ever
a
man
and
a
christian
in
the
height
of
his
devotion
a
king
and
a
hero
the
hardships
of
war
he
shared
with
the
meanest
soldier
in
his
army
maintained
a
calm
serenity
amidst
the
hottest
fury
of
battle
his
glance
was
omnipresent
and
he
intrepidly
forgot
the
danger
while
he
exposed
himself
to
the
greatest
peril
his
natural
courage
indeed
too
often
made
him
forget
the
duty
of
a
general
and
the
life
of
a
king
ended
in
the
death
of
a
common
soldier
but
such
a
leader
was
followed
to
victory
alike
by
the
coward
and
the
brave
and
his
eagle
glance
marked
every
heroic
deed
which
his
example
had
inspired
the
fame
of
their
sovereign
excited
in
the
nation
an
enthusiastic
sense
of
their
own
importance
proud
of
their
king
the
peasant
in
finland
and
gothland
joyfully
contributed
his
pittance
the
soldier
willingly
shed
his
blood
and
the
lofty
energy
which
his
single
mind
had
imparted
to
the
nation
long
survived
its
creator
the
necessity
of
the
war
was
acknowledged
but
the
best
plan
of
conducting
it
was
a
matter
of
much
question
even
to
the
bold
chancellor
oxenstiern
an
offensive
war
appeared
too
daring
a
measure
the
resources
of
his
poor
and
conscientious
master
appeared
to
him
too
slender
to
compete
with
those
of
a
despotic
sovereign
who
held
all
germany
at
his
command
but
the
minister
timid
scruples
were
overruled
by
the
hero
penetrating
prudence
if
we
await
the
enemy
in
sweden
said
gustavus
in
the
event
of
a
defeat
every
thing
would
be
lost
by
a
fortunate
commencement
in
germany
everything
would
be
gained
the
sea
is
wide
and
we
have
a
long
line
of
coast
in
sweden
to
defend
if
the
enemy
fleet
should
escape
us
or
our
own
be
defeated
it
would
in
either
case
be
impossible
to
prevent
the
enemy
landing
every
thing
depends
on
the
retention
of
stralsund
so
long
as
this
harbour
is
open
to
us
we
shall
both
command
the
baltic
and
secure
a
retreat
from
germany
but
to
protect
this
port
we
must
not
remain
in
sweden
but
advance
at
once
into
pomerania
let
us
talk
no
more
then
of
a
defensive
war
by
which
we
should
sacrifice
our
greatest
advantages
sweden
must
not
be
doomed
to
behold
a
hostile
banner
if
we
are
vanquished
in
germany
it
will
be
time
enough
to
follow
your
plan
gustavus
resolved
to
cross
the
baltic
and
attack
the
emperor
his
preparations
were
made
with
the
utmost
expedition
and
his
precautionary
measures
were
not
less
prudent
than
the
resolution
itself
was
bold
and
magnanimous
before
engaging
in
so
distant
a
war
it
was
necessary
to
secure
sweden
against
its
neighbours
at
a
personal
interview
with
the
king
of
denmark
at
markaroed
gustavus
assured
himself
of
the
friendship
of
that
monarch
his
frontier
on
the
side
of
moscow
was
well
guarded
poland
might
be
held
in
check
from
germany
if
it
betrayed
any
design
of
infringing
the
truce
falkenberg
a
swedish
ambassador
who
visited
the
courts
of
holland
and
germany
obtained
the
most
flattering
promises
from
several
protestant
princes
though
none
of
them
yet
possessed
courage
or
enough
to
enter
into
a
formal
alliance
with
him
lubeck
and
hamburg
engaged
to
advance
him
money
and
to
accept
swedish
copper
in
return
emissaries
were
also
despatched
to
the
prince
of
transylvania
to
excite
that
implacable
enemy
of
austria
to
arms
in
the
mean
time
swedish
levies
were
made
in
germany
and
the
netherlands
the

increased
to
their
full
complement

thirty
ships
of

were
in
a
short
time
prepared
men
equipped
and
transports
were
ready
to
convey
them
across
the
baltic
a
greater
force
gustavus
adolphus
was
unwilling
to
carry
into
germany
and
even
the
maintenance
of
this
exceeded
the
revenues
of
his
kingdom
but
however
small
his
army
it
was
admirable
in
all
points
of
discipline
courage
and
experience
and
might
serve
as
the
nucleus
of
a
more
powerful
armament
if
it
once
gained
the
german
frontier
and
its
first
attempts
were
attended
with
success
oxenstiern
at
once
general
and
chancellor
was
posted
with
men
in
prussia
to
protect
that
province

as
a
nursery
for
the
main
body
remained
in
sweden
as
a
defence
against
a
sudden
invasion
by
any
treacherous
neighbour
these
were
the
measures
taken
for
the
external
defence
of
the
kingdom
its
internal
administration
was
provided
for
with
equal
care
the
government
was
intrusted
to
the
council
of
state
and
the
finances
to
the
palatine
john
casimir
the
of
the
king
while
his
wife
tenderly
as
he
was
attached
to
her
was
excluded
from
all
share
in
the
government
for
which
her
limited
talents
incapacitated
her
he
set
his
house
in
order
like
a
dying
man
on
the
may
when
all
his
measures
were
arranged
and
all
was
ready
for
his
departure
the
king
appeared
in
the
diet
at
stockholm
to
bid
the
states
a
solemn
farewell
taking
in
his
arms
his
daughter
christina
then
only
four
years
old
who
in
the
cradle
had
been
acknowledged
as
his
successor
he
presented
her
to
the
states
as
the
future
sovereign
exacted
from
them
a
renewal
of
the
oath
of
allegiance
to
her
in
case
he
should
never
more
return
and
then
read
the
ordinances
for
the
government
of
the
kingdom
during
his
absence
or
the
minority
of
his
daughter
the
whole
assembly
was
dissolved
in
tears
and
the
king
himself
was
some
time
before
he
could
attain
sufficient
composure
to
deliver
his
farewell
address
to
the
states
not
lightly
or
wantonly
said
he
am
i
about
to
involve
myself
and
you
in
this
new
and
dangerous
war
god
is
my
witness
that
do
not
fight
to
gratify
my
own
ambition
but
the
emperor
has
wronged
me
most
shamefully
in
the
person
of
my
ambassadors
he
has
supported
my
enemies
persecuted
my
friends
and
brethren
trampled
my
religion
in
the
dust
and
even
stretched
his
revengeful
arm
against
my
crown
the
oppressed
states
of
germany
call
loudly
for
aid
which
by
god
help
we
will
give
them
i
am
fully
sensible
of
the
dangers
to
which
my
life
will
be
exposed
i
have
never
yet
shrunk
from
them
nor
is
it
likely
that
i
shall
escape
them
all
hitherto
providence
has
wonderfully
protected
me
but
i
shall
at
last
fall
in
defence
of
my
country
i
commend
you
to
the
protection
of
heaven
be
just
be
conscientious

uprightly
and
we
shall
meet
again
in
eternity
to
you
my
counsellors

myself

may
god
enlighten
you
and
fill
you
with
wisdom
to
promote
the
welfare
of
my
people

too
my
brave
nobles
i
commend
to
the
divine
protection

to
prove
yourselves
the
worthy
successors
of
those
gothic
heroes

bravery
humbled

the
dust

pride
of

to
you
ministers

i
recommend
moderation
and

be
yourselves
examples
of
the
virtues
which
you
preach
and
abuse

the
minds
of
my
people

i
entreat
the
blessing
of

your
industry
be
rewarded
by
a
prosperous
harvest

stores
plenteously
filled

may
you
be

i
bid
you
all
a
sincere
it
may
be
an
eternal
farewell
the
embarkation
of
the
troops
took
place
at
elfsknaben
where
the
fleet
lay
at
anchor
an
immense
concourse
flocked
thither
to
witness
this
magnificent
spectacle
the
hearts
of
the
spectators
were
agitated
by
varied
emotions
as
they
alternately
considered
the
vastness
of
the
enterprise
and
the
greatness
of
the
leader
among
the
superior
officers
who
commanded
in
this
army
were

thurn
ottenberg
baudissen
banner
teufel
tott
mutsenfahl
falkenberg
kniphausen
and
other
distinguished

detained
by
contrary
winds
the
fleet
did
not
sail
till
june
and
on
the
of
that
month
reached
the
island
of
rugen
in
pomerania
gustavus
adolphus
was
the
first
who
landed
in
the
presence
of
his
suite
he
knelt
on
the
shore
of
germany
to
return
thanks
to
the
almighty
for
the
safe
arrival
of
his
fleet
and
his
army
he
landed
his
troops
on
the
islands
of
wollin
and
usedom
upon
his
approach
the
imperial
garrisons
abandoned
their
entrenchments
and
fled
he
advanced
rapidly
on
stettin
to
secure
this
important
place
before
the
appearance
of
the
imperialists
bogislaus
duke
of
pomerania
a
feeble
and
superannuated
prince
had
been
long
tired
out
by
the
outrages
committed
by
the
latter
within
his
territories
but
too
weak
to
resist
he
had
contented
himself
with
murmurs
the
appearance
of
his
deliverer
instead
of
animating
his
courage
increased
his
fear
and
anxiety
severely
as
his
country
had
suffered
from
the
imperialists
the
risk
of
incurring
the
emperor
vengeance
prevented
him
from
declaring
openly
for
the
swedes
gustavus
adolphus
who
was
encamped
under
the
walls
of
the
town
summoned
the
city
to
receive
a
swedish
garrison
bogislaus
appeared
in
person
in
the
camp
of
gustavus
to
deprecate
this
condition
i
come
to
you
said
gustavus
not
as
an
enemy
but
a
friend
i
wage
no
war
against
pomerania
nor
against
the
german
empire
but
against
the
enemies
of
both
in
my
hands
this
duchy
shall
be
sacred
and
it
shall
be
restored
to
you
at
the
conclusion
of
the
campaign
by
me
with
more
certainty
than
by
any
other
look
to
the
traces
of
the
imperial
force
within
your
territories
and
to
mine
in
usedom
and
decide
whether
you
will
have
the
emperor
or
me
as
your
friend
what
have
you
to
expect
if
the
emperor
should
make
himself
master
of
your
capital
will
he
deal
with
you
more
leniently
than
i
or
is
it
your
intention
to
stop
my
progress
the
case
is
pressing
decide
at
once
and
do
not
compel
me
to
have
recourse
to
more
violent
measures
the
alternative
was
a
painful
one
on
the
one
side
the
king
of
sweden
was
before
his
gates
with
a
formidable
army
on
the
other
he
saw
the
inevitable
vengeance
of
the
emperor
and
the
fearful
example
of
so
many
german
princes
who
were
now
wandering
in
misery
the
victims
of
that
revenge
the
more
immediate
danger
decided
his
resolution
the
gates
of
stettin
were
opened
to
the
king
the
swedish
troops
entered
and
the
austrians
who
were
advancing
by
rapid
marches
anticipated
the
capture
of
this
place
procured
for
the
king
a
firm
footing
in
pomerania
the
command
of
the
oder
and
a
magazine
for
his
troops
to
prevent
a
charge
of
treachery
bogislaus
was
careful
to
excuse
this
step
to
the
emperor
on
the
plea
of
necessity
but
aware
of
ferdinand
implacable
disposition
he
entered
into
a
close
alliance
with
his
new
protector
by
this
league
with
pomerania
gustavus
secured
a
powerful
friend
in
germany
who
covered
his
rear
and
maintained
his
communication
with
sweden
as
ferdinand
was
already
the
aggressor
in
prussia
gustavus
adolphus
thought
himself
absolved
from
the
usual
formalities
and
commenced
hostilities
without
any
declaration
of
war
to
the
other
european
powers
he
justified
his
conduct
in
a
manifesto
in
which
he
detailed
the
grounds
which
had
led
him
to
take
up
arms
meanwhile
he
continued
his
progress
in
pomerania
while
he
saw
his
army
daily
increasing
the
troops
which
had
fought
under
mansfeld
duke
christian
of
brunswick
the
king
of
denmark
and
wallenstein
came
in
crowds
both
officers
and
soldiers
to
join
his
victorious
standard
at
the
imperial
court
the
invasion
of
the
king
of
sweden
at
first
excited
far
less
attention
than
it
merited
the
pride
of
austria
extravagantly
elated
by
its
successes
looked
down
with
contempt
upon
a
prince
who
with
a
handful
of
men
came
from
an
obscure
corner
of
europe
and
who
owed
his
past
successes
as
they
imagined
entirely
to
the
incapacity
of
a
weak
opponent
the
depreciatory
representation
which
wallenstein
had
artfully
given
of
the
swedish
power
increased
the
emperor
security
for
what
had
he
to
fear
from
an
enemy
whom
his
general
undertook
to
drive
with
such
ease
from
germany
even
the
rapid
progress
of
gustavus
adolphus
in
pomerania
could
not
entirely
dispel
this
prejudice
which
the
mockeries
of
the
courtiers
continued
to
feed
he
was
called
in
vienna
the
snow
king
whom
the
cold
of
the
north
kept
together
but
who
would
infallibly
melt
as
he
advanced
southward
even
the
electors
assembled
in
ratisbon
disregarded
his
representations
and
influenced
by
an
abject
complaisance
to
ferdinand
refused
him
even
the
title
of
king
but
while
they
mocked
him
in
ratisbon
and
vienna
in
mecklenburg
and
pomerania
one
strong
town
after
another
fell
into
his
hands
notwithstanding
this
contempt
the
emperor
thought
it
proper
to
offer
to
adjust
his
differences
with
sweden
by
negociation
and
for
that
purpose
sent
plenipotentiaries
to
denmark
but
their
instructions
showed
how
little
he
was
in
earnest
in
these
proposals
for
he
still
continued
to
refuse
to
gustavus
the
title
of
king
he
hoped
by
this
means
to
throw
on
the
king
of
sweden
the
odium
of
being
the
aggressor
and
thereby
to
ensure
the
support
of
the
states
of
the
empire
the
conference
at
dantzic
proved
as
might
be
expected
fruitless
and
the
animosity
of
both
parties
was
increased
to
its
utmost
by
an
intemperate
correspondence
an
imperial
general
torquato
conti
who
commanded
in
pomerania
had
in
the
mean
time
made
a
vain
attempt
to
wrest
stettin
from
the
swedes
the
imperialists
were
driven
out
from
one
place
after
another
damm
stargard
camin
and
wolgast
soon
fell
into
the
hands
of
gustavus
to
revenge
himself
upon
the
duke
of
pomerania
the
imperial
general
permitted
his
troops
upon
his
retreat
to
exercise
every
barbarity
on
the
unfortunate
inhabitants
of
pomerania
who
had
already
suffered
but
too
severely
from
his
avarice
on
pretence
of
cutting
off
the
resources
of
the
swedes
the
whole
country
was
laid
waste
and
plundered
and
often
when
the
imperialists
were
unable
any
longer
to
maintain
a
place
it
was
laid
in
ashes
in
order
to
leave
the
enemy
nothing
but
ruins
but
these
barbarities
only
served
to
place
in
a
more
favourable
light
the
opposite
conduct
of
the
swedes
and
to
win
all
hearts
to
their
humane
monarch
the
swedish
soldier
paid
for
all
he
required
no
private
property
was
injured
on
his
march
the
swedes
consequently
were
received
with
open
arms
both
in
town
and
country
whilst
every
imperialist
that
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
pomeranian
peasantry
was
ruthlessly
murdered
many
pomeranians
entered
into
the
service
of
sweden
and
the
estates
of
this
exhausted
country
willingly
voted
the
king
a
contribution
of
florins
torquato
conti
who
with
all
his
severity
of
character
was
a
consummate
general
endeavoured
to
render
stettin
useless
to
the
king
of
sweden
as
he
could
not
deprive
him
of
it
he
entrenched
himself
upon
the
oder
at
gartz
above
stettin
in
order
by
commanding
that
river
to
cut
off
the
water
communication
of
the
town
with
the
rest
of
germany
nothing
could
induce
him
to
attack
the
king
of
sweden
who
was
his
superior
in
numbers
while
the
latter
was
equally
cautious
not
to
storm
the
strong
entrenchments
of
the
imperialists
torquato
too
deficient
in
troops
and
money
to
act
upon
the
offensive
against
the
king
hoped
by
this
plan
of
operations
to
give
time
for
tilly
to
hasten
to
the
defence
of
pomerania
and
then
in
conjunction
with
that
general
to
attack
the
swedes
seizing
the
opportunity
of
the
temporary
absence
of
gustavus
he
made
a
sudden
attempt
upon
stettin
but
the
swedes
were
not
unprepared
for
him
a
vigorous
attack
of
the
imperialists
was
firmly
repulsed
and
torquato
was
forced
to
retire
with
great
loss
for
this
auspicious
commencement
of
the
war
however
gustavus
was
it
must
be
owned
as
much
indebted
to
his
good
fortune
as
to
his
military
talents
the
imperial
troops
in
pomerania
had
been
greatly
reduced
since
wallenstein
dismissal
moreover
the
outrages
they
had
committed
were
now
severely
revenged
upon
them
wasted
and
exhausted
the
country
no
longer
afforded
them
a
subsistence
all
discipline
was
at
an
end
the
orders
of
the
officers
were
disregarded
while
their
numbers
daily
decreased
by
desertion
and
by
a
general
mortality
which
the
piercing
cold
of
a
strange
climate
had
produced
among
them
under
these
circumstances
the
imperial
general
was
anxious
to
allow
his
troops
the
repose
of
winter
quarters
but
he
had
to
do
with
an
enemy
to
whom
the
climate
of
germany
had
no
winter
gustavus
had
taken
the
precaution
of
providing
his
soldiers
with
dresses
of
to
enable
them
to
keep
the
field
even
in
the
most
inclement
season
the
imperial
plenipotentiaries
who
came
to
treat
with
him
for
a
cessation
of
hostilities
received
this
discouraging
answer
the
swedes
are
soldiers
in
winter
as
well
as
in
summer
and
not
disposed
to
oppress
the
unfortunate
peasantry
the
imperialists
may
act
as
they
think
proper
but
they
need
not
expect
to
remain
undisturbed
torquato
conti
soon
after
resigned
a
command
in
which
neither
riches
nor
reputation
were
to
be
gained
in
this
inequality
of
the
two
armies
the
advantage
was
necessarily
on
the
side
of
the
swedes
the
imperialists
were
incessantly
harassed
in
their
winter
quarters
greifenhagan
an
important
place
upon
the
oder
taken
by
storm
and
the
towns
of
gartz
and
piritz
were
at
last
abandoned
by
the
enemy
in
the
whole
of
pomerania
greifswald
demmin
and
colberg
alone
remained
in
their
hands
and
these
the
king
made
great
preparations
to
besiege
the
enemy
directed
their
retreat
towards
brandenburg
in
which
much
of
their
artillery
and
baggage
and
many
prisoners
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
pursuers
by
seizing
the
passes
of
riebnitz
and
damgarden
gustavus
had
opened
a
passage
into
mecklenburg
whose
inhabitants
were
invited
to
return
to
their
allegiance
under
their
legitimate
sovereigns
and
to
expel
the
adherents
of
wallenstein
the
imperialists
however
gained
the
important
town
of
rostock
by
stratagem
and
thus
prevented
the
farther
advance
of
the
king
who
was
unwilling
to
divide
his
forces
the
exiled
dukes
of
mecklenburg
had
ineffectually
employed
the
princes
assembled
at
ratisbon
to
intercede
with
the
emperor
in
vain
they
had
endeavoured
to
soften
ferdinand
by
renouncing
the
alliance
of
the
king
and
every
idea
of
resistance
but
driven
to
despair
by
the
emperor
inflexibility
they
openly
espoused
the
side
of
sweden
and
raising
troops
gave
the
command
of
them
to
francis
charles
duke
of
that
general
made
himself
master
of
several
strong
places
on
the
elbe
but
lost
them
afterwards
to
the
imperial
general
pappenheim
who
was
despatched
to
oppose
him
soon
afterwards
besieged
by
the
latter
in
the
town
of
ratzeburg
he
was
compelled
to
surrender
with
all
his
troops
thus
ended
the
attempt
which
these
unfortunate
princes
made
to
recover
their
territories
and
it
was
reserved
for
the
victorious
arm
of
gustavus
adolphus
to
render
them
that
brilliant
service
the
imperialists
had
thrown
themselves
into
brandenburg
which
now
became
the
theatre
of
the
most
barbarous
atrocities
these
outrages
were
inflicted
upon
the
subjects
of
a
prince
who
had
never
injured
the
emperor
and
whom
moreover
he
was
at
the
very
time
inciting
to
take
up
arms
against
the
king
of
sweden
the
sight
of
the
disorders
of
their
soldiers
which
want
of
money
compelled
them
to
wink
at
and
of
authority
over
their
troops
excited
the
disgust
even
of
the
imperial
generals
and
from
very
shame
their
count
schaumburg
wished
to
resign
without
a
sufficient
force
to
protect
his
territories
and
left
by
the
emperor
in
spite
of
the
most
pressing
remonstrances
without
assistance
the
elector
of
brandenburg
at
last
issued
an
edict
ordering
his
subjects
to
repel
force
by
force
and
to
put
to
death
without
mercy
every
imperial
soldier
who
should
henceforth
be
detected
in
plundering
to
such
a
height
had
the
violence
of
outrage
and
the
misery
of
the
government
risen
that
nothing
was
left
to
the
sovereign
but
the
desperate
extremity
of
sanctioning
private
vengeance
by
a
formal
law
the
swedes
had
pursued
the
imperialists
into
brandenburg
and
only
the
elector
refusal
to
open
to
him
the
fortress
of
custrin
for
his
march
obliged
the
king
to
lay
aside
his
design
of
besieging
frankfort
on
the
oder
he
therefore
returned
to
complete
the
conquest
of
pomerania
by
the
capture
of
demmin
and
colberg
in
the
mean
time
tilly
was
advancing
to
the
defence
of
brandenburg
this
general
who
could
boast
as
yet
of
never
having
suffered
a
defeat
the
conqueror
of
mansfeld
of
duke
christian
of
brunswick
of
the
margrave
of
baden
and
the
king
of
denmark
was
now
in
the
swedish
monarch
to
meet
an
opponent
worthy
of
his
fame
descended
of
a
noble
family
in
liege
tilly
had
formed
his
military
talents
in
the
wars
of
the
netherlands
which
was
then
the
great
school
for
generals
he
soon
found
an
opportunity
of
distinguishing
himself
under
rodolph
ii
in
hungary
where
he
rapidly
rose
from
one
step
to
another
after
the
peace
he
entered
into
the
service
of
maximilian
of
bavaria
who
made
him
with
absolute
powers
here
by
his
excellent
regulations
he
was
the
founder
of
the
bavarian
army
and
to
him
chiefly
maximilian
was
indebted
for
his
superiority
in
the
field
upon
the
termination
of
the
bohemian
war
he
was
appointed
commander
of
the
troops
of
the
league
and
after
wallenstein
dismissal
generalissimo
of
the
imperial
armies
equally
stern
towards
his
soldiers
and
implacable
towards
his
enemies
and
as
gloomy
and
impenetrable
as
wallenstein
he
was
greatly
his
superior
in
probity
and
disinterestedness
a
bigoted
zeal
for
religion
and
a
bloody
spirit
of
persecution
with
the
natural
ferocity
of
his
character
to
make
him
the
terror
of
the
protestants
a
strange
and
terrific
aspect
bespoke
his
character
of
low
stature
thin
with
hollow
cheeks
a
long
nose
a
broad
and
wrinkled
forehead
large
whiskers
and
a
pointed
chin
he
was
generally
attired
in
a
spanish
doublet
of
green
satin
with
slashed
sleeves
with
a
small
high
peaked
hat
upon
his
head
surmounted
by
a
red
feather
which
hung
down
to
his
back
his
whole
aspect
recalled
to
recollection
the
duke
of
alva
the
scourge
of
the
flemings
and
his
actions
were
far
from
effacing
the
impression
such
was
the
general
who
was
now
to
be
opposed
to
the
hero
of
the
north
tilly
was
far
from
undervaluing
his
antagonist
the
king
of
sweden
said
he
in
the
diet
at
ratisbon
is
an
enemy
both
prudent
and
brave
inured
to
war
and
in
the
flower
of
his
age
his
plans
are
excellent
his
resources
considerable
his
subjects
enthusiastically
attached
to
him
his
army
composed
of
swedes
germans
livonians
finlanders
scots
and
english
by
its
devoted
obedience
to
their
leader
is
blended
into
one
nation
he
is
a
gamester
in
playing
with
whom
not
to
have
lost
is
to
have
won
a
great
deal
the
progress
of
the
king
of
sweden
in
brandenburg
and
pomerania
left
the
new
generalissimo
no
time
to
lose
and
his
presence
was
now
urgently
called
for
by
those
who
commanded
in
that
quarter
with
all
expedition
he
collected
the
imperial
troops
which
were
dispersed
over
the
empire
but
it
required
time
to
obtain
from
the
exhausted
and
impoverished
provinces
the
necessary
supplies
at
last
about
the
middle
of
winter
he
appeared
at
the
head
of
men
before
frankfort
on
the
oder
where
he
was
joined
by
schaumburg
leaving
to
this
general
the
defence
of
frankfort
with
a
sufficient
garrison
he
hastened
to
pomerania
with
a
view
of
saving
demmin
and
relieving
colberg
which
was
already
hard
pressed
by
the
swedes
but
even
before
he
had
left
brandenburg
demmin
which
was
but
poorly
defended
by
the
duke
of
savelli
had
surrendered
to
the
king
and
colberg
after
a
five
months
siege
was
starved
into
a
capitulation
as
the
passes
in
upper
pomerania
were
well
guarded
and
the
king
camp
near
schwedt
defied
attack
tilly
abandoned
his
offensive
plan
of
operations
and
retreated
towards
the
elbe
to
besiege
magdeburg
the
capture
of
demmin
opened
to
the
king
a
free
passage
into
mecklenburg
but
a
more
important
enterprise
drew
his
arms
into
another
quarter
scarcely
had
tilly
commenced
his
retrograde
movement
when
suddenly
breaking
up
his
camp
at
schwedt
the
king
marched
his
whole
force
against
frankfort
on
the
oder
this
town
badly
fortified
was
defended
by
a
garrison
of
men
mostly
composed
of
those
ferocious
bands
who
had
so
cruelly
ravaged
pomerania
and
brandenburg
it
was
now
attacked
with
such
impetuosity
that
on
the
third
day
it
was
taken
by
storm
the
swedes
assured
of
victory
rejected
every
offer
of
capitulation
as
they
were
resolved
to
exercise
the
dreadful
right
of
retaliation
for
tilly
soon
after
his
arrival
had
surrounded
a
swedish
detachment
and
irritated
by
their
obstinate
resistance
had
cut
them
in
pieces
to
a
man
this
cruelty
was
not
forgotten
by
the
swedes
new
brandenburg
quarter
they
replied
to
the
imperialists
who
begged
their
lives
and
slaughtered
them
without
mercy
several
thousands
were
either
killed
or
taken
and
many
were
drowned
in
the
oder
the
rest
fled
to
silesia
all
their
artillery
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
swedes
to
satisfy
the
rage
of
his
troops
gustavus
adolphus
was
under
the
necessity
of
giving
up
the
town
for
three
hours
to
plunder
while
the
king
was
thus
advancing
from
one
conquest
to
another
and
by
his
success
encouraging
the
protestants
to
active
resistance
the
emperor
proceeded
to
enforce
the
edict
of
restitution
and
by
his
exorbitant
pretensions
to
exhaust
the
patience
of
the
states
compelled
by
necessity
he
continued
the
violent
course
which
he
had
begun
with
such
arrogant
confidence
the
difficulties
into
which
his
arbitrary
conduct
had
plunged
him
he
could
only
extricate
himself
from
by
measures
still
more
arbitrary
but
in
so
complicated
a
body
as
the
german
empire
despotism
must
always
create
the
most
dangerous
convulsions
with
astonishment
the
princes
beheld
the
constitution
of
the
empire
overthrown
and
the
state
of
nature
to
which
matters
were
again
verging
suggested
to
them
the
idea
of
the
only
means
of
protection
in
such
a
state
of
things
the
steps
openly
taken
by
the
emperor
against
the
lutheran
church
had
at
last
removed
the
veil
from
the
eyes
of
john
george
who
had
been
so
long
the
dupe
of
his
artful
policy
ferdinand
too
had
personally
offended
him
by
the
exclusion
of
his
son
from
the
archbishopric
of
magdeburg
and
arnheim
his
new
favourite
and
minister
spared
no
pains
to
increase
the
resentment
of
his
master
arnheim
had
formerly
been
an
imperial
general
under
wallenstein
and
being
still
zealously
attached
to
him
he
was
eager
to
avenge
his
old
benefactor
and
himself
on
the
emperor
by
detaching
saxony
from
the
austrian
interests
gustavus
adolphus
supported
by
the
protestant
states
would
be
invincible
a
consideration
which
already
filled
the
emperor
with
alarm
the
example
of
saxony
would
probably
influence
others
and
the
emperor
fate
seemed
now
in
a
manner
to
depend
upon
the
elector
decision
the
artful
favourite
impressed
upon
his
master
this
idea
of
his
own
importance
and
advised
him
to
terrify
the
emperor
by
threatening
an
alliance
with
sweden
and
thus
to
extort
from
his
fears
what
he
had
sought
in
vain
from
his
gratitude
the
favourite
however
was
far
from
wishing
him
actually
to
enter
into
the
swedish
alliance
but
by
holding
aloof
from
both
parties
to
maintain
his
own
importance
and
independence
accordingly
he
laid
before
him
a
plan
which
only
wanted
a
more
able
hand
to
carry
it
into
execution
and
recommended
him
by
heading
the
protestant
party
to
erect
a
third
power
in
germany
and
thereby
maintain
the
balance
between
sweden
and
austria
this
project
was
peculiarly
flattering
to
the
saxon
elector
to
whom
the
idea
of
being
dependent
upon
sweden
or
of
longer
submitting
to
the
tyranny
of
the
emperor
was
equally
hateful
he
could
not
with
indifference
see
the
control
of
german
affairs
wrested
from
him
by
a
foreign
prince
and
incapable
as
he
was
of
taking
a
principal
part
his
vanity
would
not
condescend
to
act
a
subordinate
one
he
resolved
therefore
to
draw
every
possible
advantage
from
the
progress
of
gustavus
but
to
pursue
independently
his
own
separate
plans
with
this
view
he
consulted
with
the
elector
of
brandenburg
who
from
similar
causes
was
ready
to
act
against
the
emperor
but
at
the
same
time
was
jealous
of
sweden
in
a
diet
at
torgau
having
assured
himself
of
the
support
of
his
estates
he
invited
the
protestant
states
of
the
empire
to
a
general
convention
which
took
place
at
leipzig
on
the
february
brandenburg
hesse
cassel
with
several
princes
counts
estates
of
the
empire
and
protestant
bishops
were
present
either
personally
or
by
deputy
at
this
assembly
which
the
chaplain
to
the
saxon
court
dr
hoe
von
hohenegg
opened
with
a
vehement
discourse
from
the
pulpit
the
emperor
had
in
vain
endeavoured
to
prevent
this
convention
whose
object
was
evidently
to
provide
for
its
own
defence
and
which
the
presence
of
the
swedes
in
the
empire
rendered
more
than
usually
alarming
emboldened
by
the
progress
of
gustavus
adolphus
the
assembled
princes
asserted
their
rights
and
after
a
session
of
two
months
broke
up
with
adopting
a
resolution
which
placed
the
emperor
in
no
slight
embarrassment
its
import
was
to
demand
of
the
emperor
in
a
general
address
the
revocation
of
the
edict
of
restitution
the
withdrawal
of
his
troops
from
their
capitals
and
fortresses
the
suspension
of
all
existing
proceedings
and
the
abolition
of
abuses
and
in
the
mean
time
to
raise
an
army
of
men
to
enable
them
to
redress
their
own
grievances
if
the
emperor
should
still
refuse
satisfaction
a
further
incident
contributed
not
a
little
to
increase
the
firmness
of
the
protestant
princes
the
king
of
sweden
had
at
last
overcome
the
scruples
which
had
deterred
him
from
a
closer
alliance
with
france
and
on
the
january
concluded
a
formal
treaty
with
this
crown
after
a
serious
dispute
respecting
the
treatment
of
the
roman
catholic
princes
of
the
empire
whom
france
took
under
her
protection
and
against
whom
gustavus
claimed
the
right
of
retaliation
and
after
some
less
important
differences
with
regard
to
the
title
of
majesty
which
the
pride
of
france
was
loth
to
concede
to
the
king
of
sweden
richelieu
yielded
the
second
and
gustavus
adolphus
the
first
point
and
the
treaty
was
signed
at
beerwald
in
neumark
the
contracting
parties
mutually
covenanted
to
defend
each
other
with
a
military
force
to
protect
their
common
friends
to
restore
to
their
dominions
the
deposed
princes
of
the
empire
and
to
replace
every
thing
both
on
the
frontier
and
in
the
interior
of
germany
on
the
same
footing
on
which
it
stood
before
the
commencement
of
the
war
for
this
end
sweden
engaged
to
maintain
an
army
of
men
in
germany
and
france
agreed
to
furnish
the
swedes
with
an
annual
subsidy
of
dollars
if
the
arms
of
gustavus
were
successful
he
was
to
respect
the
roman
catholic
religion
and
the
constitution
of
the
empire
in
all
the
conquered
places
and
to
make
no
attempt
against
either
all
estates
and
princes
whether
protestant
or
roman
catholic
either
in
germany
or
in
other
countries
were
to
be
invited
to
become
parties
to
the
treaty
neither
france
nor
sweden
was
to
conclude
a
separate
peace
without
the
knowledge
and
consent
of
the
other
and
the
treaty
itself
was
to
continue
in
force
for
five
years
great
as
was
the
struggle
to
the
king
of
sweden
to
receive
subsidies
from
france
and
sacrifice
his
independence
in
the
conduct
of
the
war
this
alliance
with
france
decided
his
cause
in
germany
protected
as
he
now
was
by
the
greatest
power
in
europe
the
german
states
began
to
feel
confidence
in
his
undertaking
for
the
issue
of
which
they
had
hitherto
good
reason
to
tremble
he
became
truly
formidable
to
the
emperor
the
roman
catholic
princes
too
who
though
they
were
anxious
to
humble
austria
had
witnessed
his
progress
with
distrust
were
less
alarmed
now
that
an
alliance
with
a
roman
catholic
power
ensured
his
respect
for
their
religion
and
thus
while
gustavus
adolphus
protected
the
protestant
religion
and
the
liberties
of
germany
against
the
aggression
of
ferdinand
france
secured
those
liberties
and
the
roman
catholic
religion
against
gustavus
himself
if
the
intoxication
of
success
should
hurry
him
beyond
the
bounds
of
moderation
the
king
of
sweden
lost
no
time
in
apprizing
the
members
of
the
confederacy
of
leipzig
of
the
treaty
concluded
with
france
and
inviting
them
to
a
closer
union
with
himself
the
application
was
seconded
by
france
who
spared
no
pains
to
win
over
the
elector
of
saxony
gustavus
was
willing
to
be
content
with
secret
support
if
the
princes
should
deem
it
too
bold
a
step
as
yet
to
declare
openly
in
his
favour
several
princes
gave
him
hopes
of
his
proposals
being
accepted
on
the
first
favourable
opportunity
but
the
saxon
elector
full
of
jealousy
and
distrust
towards
the
king
of
sweden
and
true
to
the
selfish
policy
he
had
pursued
could
not
be
prevailed
upon
to
give
a
decisive
answer
the
resolution
of
the
confederacy
of
leipzig
and
the
alliance
betwixt
france
and
sweden
were
news
equally
disagreeable
to
the
emperor
against
them
he
employed
the
thunder
of
imperial
ordinances
and
the
want
of
an
army
saved
france
from
the
full
weight
of
his
displeasure
remonstrances
were
addressed
to
all
the
members
of
the
confederacy
strongly
prohibiting
them
from
enlisting
troops
they
retorted
with
explanations
equally
vehement
justified
their
conduct
upon
the
principles
of
natural
right
and
continued
their
preparations
meantime
the
imperial
generals
deficient
both
in
troops
and
money
found
themselves
reduced
to
the
disagreeable
alternative
of
losing
sight
either
of
the
king
of
sweden
or
of
the
estates
of
the
empire
since
with
a
divided
force
they
were
not
a
match
for
either
the
movements
of
the
protestants
called
their
attention
to
the
interior
of
the
empire
while
the
progress
of
the
king
in
brandenburg
by
threatening
the
hereditary
possessions
of
austria
required
them
to
turn
their
arms
to
that
quarter
after
the
conquest
of
frankfort
the
king
had
advanced
upon
landsberg
on
the
warta
and
tilly
after
a
fruitless
attempt
to
relieve
it
had
again
returned
to
magdeburg
to
prosecute
with
vigour
the
siege
of
that
town
the
rich
archbishopric
of
which
magdeburg
was
the
capital
had
long
been
in
the
possession
of
princes
of
the
house
of
brandenburg
who
introduced
the
protestant
religion
into
the
province
christian
william
the
last
administrator
had
by
his
alliance
with
denmark
incurred
the
ban
of
the
empire
on
which
account
the
chapter
to
avoid
the
emperor
displeasure
had
formally
deposed
him
in
his
place
they
had
elected
prince
john
augustus
the
second
son
of
the
elector
of
saxony
whom
the
emperor
rejected
in
order
to
confer
the
archbishopric
on
his
son
leopold
the
elector
of
saxony
complained
ineffectually
to
the
imperial
court
but
christian
william
of
brandenburg
took
more
active
measures
relying
on
the
attachment
of
the
magistracy
and
inhabitants
of
brandenburg
and
excited
by
chimerical
hopes
he
thought
himself
able
to
surmount
all
the
obstacles
which
the
vote
of
the
chapter
the
competition
of
two
powerful
rivals
and
the
edict
of
restitution
opposed
to
his
restoration
he
went
to
sweden
and
by
the
promise
of
a
diversion
in
germany
sought
to
obtain
assistance
from
gustavus
he
was
dismissed
by
that
monarch
not
without
hopes
of
effectual
protection
but
with
the
advice
to
act
with
caution
scarcely
had
christian
william
been
informed
of
the
landing
of
his
protector
in
pomerania
than
he
entered
magdeburg
in
disguise
appearing
suddenly
in
the
town
council
he
reminded
the
magistrates
of
the
ravages
which
both
town
and
country
had
suffered
from
the
imperial
troops
of
the
pernicious
designs
of
ferdinand
and
the
danger
of
the
protestant
church
he
then
informed
them
that
the
moment
of
deliverance
was
at
hand
and
that
gustavus
adolphus
offered
them
his
alliance
and
assistance
magdeburg
one
of
the
most
flourishing
towns
in
germany
enjoyed
under
the
government
of
its
magistrates
a
republican
freedom
which
inspired
its
citizens
with
a
brave
heroism
of
this
they
had
already
given
proofs
in
the
bold
defence
of
their
rights
against
wallenstein
who
tempted
by
their
wealth
made
on
them
the
most
extravagant
demands
their
territory
had
been
given
up
to
the
fury
of
his
troops
though
magdeburg
itself
had
escaped
his
vengeance
it
was
not
difficult
therefore
for
the
administrator
to
gain
the
concurrence
of
men
in
whose
minds
the
rememberance
of
these
outrages
was
still
recent
an
alliance
was
formed
between
the
city
and
the
swedish
king
by
which
magdeburg
granted
to
the
king
a
free
passage
through
its
gates
and
territories
with
liberty
of
enlisting
soldiers
within
its
boundaries
and
on
the
other
hand
obtained
promises
of
effectual
protection
for
its
religion
and
its
privileges
the
administrator
immediately
collected
troops
and
commenced
hostilities
before
gustavus
adolphus
was
near
enough
to
with
him
he
defeated
some
imperial
detachments
in
the
neighbourhood
made
a
few
conquests
and
even
surprised
halle
but
the
approach
of
an
imperial
army
obliged
him
to
retreat
hastily
and
not
without
loss
to
magdeburg
gustavus
adolphus
though
displeased
with
his
premature
measures
sent
dietrich
falkenberg
an
experienced
officer
to
direct
the
administrator
military
operations
and
to
assist
him
with
his
counsel
falkenberg
was
named
by
the
magistrates
governor
of
the
town
during
the
war
the
prince
army
was
daily
augmented
by
recruits
from
the
neighbouring
towns
and
he
was
able
for
some
months
to
maintain
a
petty
warfare
with
success
at
length
count
pappenheim
having
brought
his
expedition
against
the
duke
of
to
a
close
approached
the
town
driving
the
troops
of
the
administrator
from
their
entrenchments
he
cut
off
his
communication
with
saxony
and
closely
invested
the
place
he
was
soon
followed
by
tilly
who
haughtily
summoned
the
elector
forthwith
to
comply
with
the
edict
of
restitution
to
submit
to
the
emperor
orders
and
surrender
magdeburg
the
prince
answer
was
spirited
and
resolute
and
obliged
tilly
at
once
to
have
recourse
to
arms
in
the
meanwhile
the
siege
was
prolonged
by
the
progress
of
the
king
of
sweden
which
called
the
austrian
general
from
before
the
place
and
the
jealousy
of
the
officers
who
conducted
the
operations
in
his
absence
delayed
for
some
months
the
fall
of
magdeburg
on
the
march
tilly
returned
to
push
the
siege
with
vigour
the
outworks
were
soon
carried
and
falkenberg
after
withdrawing
the
garrisons
from
the
points
which
he
could
no
longer
hold
destroyed
the
bridge
over
the
elbe
as
his
troops
were
barely
sufficient
to
defend
the
extensive
fortifications
the
suburbs
of
sudenburg
and
neustadt
were
abandoned
to
the
enemy
who
immediately
laid
them
in
ashes
pappenheim
now
separated
from
tilly
crossed
the
elbe
at
schonenbeck
and
attacked
the
town
from
the
opposite
side
the
garrison
reduced
by
the
defence
of
the
outworks
scarcely
exceeded
infantry
and
a
few
hundred
horse
a
small
number
for
so
extensive
and
irregular
a
fortress
to
supply
this
deficiency
the
citizens
were
armed
a
desperate
expedient
which
produced
more
evils
than
those
it
prevented
the
citizens
at
best
but
indifferent
soldiers
by
their
disunion
threw
the
town
into
confusion
the
poor
complained
that
they
were
exposed
to
every
hardship
and
danger
while
the
rich
by
hiring
substitutes
remained
at
home
in
safety
these
rumours
broke
out
at
last
in
an
open
mutiny
indifference
succeeded
to
zeal
weariness
and
negligence
took
the
place
of
vigilance
and
foresight
dissension
combined
with
growing
scarcity
gradually
produced
a
feeling
of
despondence
many
began
to
tremble
at
the
desperate
nature
of
their
undertaking
and
the
magnitude
of
the
power
to
which
they
were
opposed
but
religious
zeal
an
ardent
love
of
liberty
an
invincible
hatred
to
the
austrian
yoke
and
the
expectation
of
speedy
relief
banished
as
yet
the
idea
of
a
surrender
and
divided
as
they
were
in
every
thing
else
they
were
united
in
the
resolve
to
defend
themselves
to
the
last
extremity
their
hopes
of
succour
were
apparently
well
founded
they
knew
that
the
confederacy
of
leipzig
was
arming
they
were
aware
of
the
near
approach
of
gustavus
adolphus
both
were
alike
interested
in
the
preservation
of
magdeburg
and
a
few
days
might
bring
the
king
of
sweden
before
its
walls
all
this
was
also
known
to
tilly
who
therefore
was
anxious
to
make
himself
speedily
master
of
the
place
with
this
view
he
had
despatched
a
trumpeter
with
letters
to
the
administrator
the
commandant
and
the
magistrates
offering
terms
of
capitulation
but
he
received
for
answer
that
they
would
rather
die
than
surrender
a
spirited
sally
of
the
citizens
also
convinced
him
that
their
courage
was
as
earnest
as
their
words
while
the
king
arrival
at
potsdam
with
the
incursions
of
the
swedes
as
far
as
zerbst
filled
him
with
uneasiness
but
raised
the
hopes
of
the
garrison
a
second
trumpeter
was
now
despatched
but
the
more
moderate
tone
of
his
demands
increased
the
confidence
of
the
besieged
and
unfortunately
their
negligence
also
the
besiegers
had
now
pushed
their
approaches
as
far
as
the
ditch
and
vigorously
cannonaded
the
fortifications
from
the
abandoned
batteries
one
tower
was
entirely
overthrown
but
this
did
not
facilitate
an
assault
as
it
fell
sidewise
upon
the
wall
and
not
into
the
ditch
notwithstanding
the
continual
bombardment
the
walls
had
not
suffered
much
and
the
fire
balls
which
were
intended
to
set
the
town
in
flames
were
deprived
of
their
effect
by
the
excellent
precautions
adopted
against
them
but
the
ammunition
of
the
besieged
was
nearly
expended
and
the
cannon
of
the
town
gradually
ceased
to
answer
the
fire
of
the
imperialists
before
a
new
supply
could
be
obtained
magdeburg
would
be
either
relieved
or
taken
the
hopes
of
the
besieged
were
on
the
stretch
and
all
eyes
anxiously
directed
towards
the
quarter
in
which
the
swedish
banners
were
expected
to
appear
gustavus
adolphus
was
near
enough
to
reach
magdeburg
within
three
days
security
grew
with
hope
which
all
things
contributed
to
augment
on
the
of
may
the
fire
of
the
imperialists
was
suddenly
stopped
and
the
cannon
withdrawn
from
several
of
the
batteries
a
deathlike
stillness
reigned
in
the
imperial
camp
the
besieged
were
convinced
that
deliverance
was
at
hand
both
citizens
and
soldiers
left
their
posts
upon
the
ramparts
early
in
the
morning
to
indulge
themselves
after
their
long
toils
with
the
refreshment
of
sleep
but
it
was
indeed
a
dear
sleep
and
a
frightful
awakening
tilly
had
abandoned
the
hope
of
taking
the
town
before
the
arrival
of
the
swedes
by
the
means
which
he
had
hitherto
adopted
he
therefore
determined
to
raise
the
siege
but
first
to
hazard
a
general
assault
this
plan
however
was
attended
with
great
difficulties
as
no
breach
had
been
effected
and
the
works
were
scarcely
injured
but
the
council
of
war
assembled
on
this
occasion
declared
for
an
assault
citing
the
example
of
maestricht
which
had
been
taken
early
in
the
morning
while
the
citizens
and
soldiers
were
reposing
themselves
the
attack
was
to
be
made
simultaneously
on
four
points
the
night
betwixt
the
and
of
may
was
employed
in
the
necessary
preparations
every
thing
was
ready
and
awaiting
the
signal
which
was
to
be
given
by
cannon
at
five
in
the
morning
the
signal
however
was
not
given
for
two
hours
later
during
which
tilly
who
was
still
doubtful
of
success
again
consulted
the
council
of
war
pappenheim
was
ordered
to
attack
the
works
of
the
new
town
where
the
attempt
was
favoured
by
a
sloping
rampart
and
a
dry
ditch
of
moderate
depth
the
citizens
and
soldiers
had
mostly
left
the
walls
and
the
few
who
remained
were
overcome
with
sleep
this
general
therefore
found
little
difficulty
in
mounting
the
wall
at
the
head
of
his
troops
falkenberg
roused
by
the
report
of
musketry
hastened
from
the
where
he
was
employed
in
despatching
tilly
second
trumpeter
and
hurried
with
all
the
force
he
could
hastily
assemble
towards
the
gate
of
the
new
town
which
was
already
in
the
possession
of
the
enemy
beaten
back
this
intrepid
general
flew
to
another
quarter
where
a
second
party
of
the
enemy
were
preparing
to
scale
the
walls
after
an
ineffectual
resistance
he
fell
in
the
commencement
of
the
action
the
roaring
of
musketry
the
pealing
of
the
and
the
growing
tumult
apprised
the
awakening
citizens
of
their
danger
hastily
arming
themselves
they
rushed
in
blind
confusion
against
the
enemy
still
some
hope
of
repulsing
the
besiegers
remained
but
the
governor
being
killed
their
efforts
were
without
plan
and
and
at
last
their
ammunition
began
to
fail
them
in
the
meanwhile
two
other
gates
hitherto
unattacked
were
stripped
of
their
defenders
to
meet
the
urgent
danger
within
the
town
the
enemy
quickly
availed
themselves
of
this
confusion
to
attack
these
posts
the
resistance
was
nevertheless
spirited
and
obstinate
until
four
imperial
regiments
at
length
masters
of
the
ramparts
fell
upon
the
garrison
in
the
rear
and
completed
their
rout
amidst
the
general
tumult
a
brave
captain
named
schmidt
who
still
headed
a
few
of
the
more
resolute
against
the
enemy
succeeded
in
driving
them
to
the
gates
here
he
fell
mortally
wounded
and
with
him
expired
the
hopes
of
magdeburg
before
noon
all
the
works
were
carried
and
the
town
was
in
the
enemy
hands
two
gates
were
now
opened
by
the
storming
party
for
the
main
body
and
tilly
marched
in
with
part
of
his
infantry
immediately
occupying
the
principal
streets
he
drove
the
citizens
with
pointed
cannon
into
their
dwellings
there
to
await
their
destiny
they
were
not
long
held
in
suspense
a
word
from
tilly
decided
the
fate
of
magdeburg
even
a
more
humane
general
would
in
vain
have
recommended
mercy
to
such
soldiers
but
tilly
never
made
the
attempt
left
by
their
general
silence
masters
of
the
lives
of
all
the
citizens
the
soldiery
broke
into
the
houses
to
satiate
their
most
brutal
appetites
the
prayers
of
innocence
excited
some
compassion
in
the
hearts
of
the
germans
but
none
in
the
rude
breasts
of
pappenheim
walloons
scarcely
had
the
savage
cruelty
commenced
when
the
other
gates
were
thrown
open
and
the
cavalry
with
the
fearful
hordes
of
the
croats
poured
in
upon
the
devoted
inhabitants
here
commenced
a
scene
of
horrors
for
which
history
has
no
language
poetry
no
pencil
neither
innocent
childhood
nor
helpless
old
age
neither
youth
sex
rank
nor
beauty
could
disarm
the
fury
of
the
conquerors
wives
were
abused
in
the
arms
of
their
husbands
daughters
at
the
feet
of
their
parents
and
the
defenceless
sex
exposed
to
the
double
sacrifice
of
virtue
and
life
no
situation
however
obscure
or
however
sacred
escaped
the
rapacity
of
the
enemy
in
a
single
church
women
were
found
beheaded
the
croats
amused
themselves
with
throwing
children
into
the
flames
pappenheim
walloons
with
stabbing
infants
at
the
mother
breast
some
officers
of
the
league
at
this
dreadful
scene
ventured
to
remind
tilly
that
he
had
it
in
his
power
to
stop
the
carnage
return
in
an
hour
was
his
answer
i
will
see
what
i
can
do
the
soldier
must
have
some
reward
for
his
danger
and
toils
these
horrors
lasted
with
unabated
fury
till
at
last
the
smoke
and
flames
proved
a
check
to
the
plunderers
to
augment
the
confusion
and
to
divert
the
resistance
of
the
inhabitants
the
imperialists
had
in
the
commencement
of
the
assault
fired
the
town
in
several
places
the
wind
rising
rapidly
spread
the
flames
till
the
blaze
became
universal
fearful
indeed
was
the
tumult
amid
clouds
of
smoke
heaps
of
dead
bodies
the
clash
of
swords
the
crash
of
falling
ruins
and
streams
of
blood
the
atmosphere
glowed
and
the
intolerable
heat
forced
at
last
even
the
murderers
to
take
refuge
in
their
camp
in
less
than
twelve
hours
this
strong
populous
and
flourishing
city
one
of
the
finest
in
germany
was
reduced
to
ashes
with
the
exception
of
two
churches
and
a
few
houses
the
administrator
christian
william
after
receiving
several
wounds
was
taken
prisoner
with
three
of
the
burgomasters
most
of
the
officers
and
magistrates
had
already
met
an
enviable
death
the
avarice
of
the
officers
had
saved
of
the
richest
citizens
in
the
hope
of
extorting
from
them
an
exorbitant
ransom
but
this
humanity
was
confined
to
the
officers
of
the
league
whom
the
ruthless
barbarity
of
the
imperialists
caused
to
be
regarded
as
guardian
angels
scarcely
had
the
fury
of
the
flames
abated
when
the
imperialists
returned
to
renew
the
pillage
amid
the
ruins
and
ashes
of
the
town
many
were
suffocated
by
the
smoke
many
found
rich
booty
in
the
cellars
where
the
citizens
had
concealed
their
more
valuable
effects
on
the
of
may
tilly
himself
appeared
in
the
town
after
the
streets
had
been
cleared
of
ashes
and
dead
bodies
horrible
and
revolting
to
humanity
was
the
scene
that
presented
itself
the
living
crawling
from
under
the
dead
children
wandering
about
with
cries
calling
for
their
parents
and
infants
still
sucking
the
breasts
of
their
lifeless
mothers
more
than
bodies
were
thrown
into
the
elbe
to
clear
the
streets
a
much
greater
number
had
been
consumed
by
the
flames
the
whole
number
of
the
slain
was
reckoned
at
not
less
than
the
entrance
of
the
general
which
took
place
on
the
put
a
stop
to
the
plunder
and
saved
the
few
who
had
hitherto
contrived
to
escape
about
a
thousand
people
were
taken
out
of
the
cathedral
where
they
had
remained
three
days
and
two
nights
without
food
and
in
momentary
fear
of
death
tilly
promised
them
quarter
and
commanded
bread
to
be
distributed
among
them
the
next
day
a
solemn
mass
was
performed
in
the
cathedral
and
deum
sung
amidst
the
discharge
of
artillery
the
imperial
general
rode
through
the
streets
that
he
might
be
able
as
an
eyewitness
to
inform
his
master
that
no
such
conquest
had
been
made
since
the
destruction
of
troy
and
jerusalem
nor
was
this
an
exaggeration
whether
we
consider
the
greatness
importance
and
prosperity
of
the
city
razed
or
the
fury
of
its
ravagers
in
germany
the
tidings
of
the
dreadful
fate
of
magdeburg
caused
triumphant
joy
to
the
roman
catholics
while
it
spread
terror
and
consternation
among
the
protestants
loudly
and
generally
they
complained
against
the
king
of
sweden
who
with
so
strong
a
force
and
in
the
very
neighbourhood
had
left
an
allied
city
to
its
fate
even
the
most
reasonable
deemed
his
inaction
inexplicable
and
lest
he
should
lose
irretrievably
the
good
will
of
the
people
for
whose
deliverance
he
had
engaged
in
this
war
gustavus
was
under
the
necessity
of
publishing
to
the
world
a
justification
of
his
own
conduct
he
had
attacked
and
on
the
april
carried
landsberg
when
he
was
apprised
of
the
danger
of
magdeburg
he
resolved
immediately
to
march
to
the
relief
of
that
town
and
he
moved
with
all
his
cavalry
and
ten
regiments
of
infantry
towards
the
spree
but
the
position
which
he
held
in
germany
made
it
necessary
that
he
should
not
move
forward
without
securing
his
rear
in
traversing
a
country
where
he
was
surrounded
by
suspicious
friends
and
dangerous
enemies
and
where
a
single
premature
movement
might
cut
off
his
communication
with
his
own
kingdom
the
utmost
vigilance
and
caution
were
necessary
the
elector
of
brandenburg
had
already
opened
the
fortress
of
custrin
to
the
flying
imperialists
and
closed
the
gates
against
their
pursuers
if
now
gustavus
should
fail
in
his
attack
upon
tilly
the
elector
might
again
open
his
fortresses
to
the
imperialists
and
the
king
with
an
enemy
both
in
front
and
rear
would
be
irrecoverably
lost
in
order
to
prevent
this
contingency
he
demanded
that
the
elector
should
allow
him
to
hold
the
fortresses
of
custrin
and
spandau
till
the
siege
of
magdeburg
should
be
raised
nothing
could
be
more
reasonable
than
this
demand
the
services
which
gustavus
had
lately
rendered
the
elector
by
expelling
the
imperialists
from
brandenburg
claimed
his
gratitude
while
the
past
conduct
of
the
swedes
in
germany
entitled
them
to
confidence
but
by
the
surrender
of
his
fortresses
the
elector
would
in
some
measure
make
the
king
of
sweden
master
of
his
country
besides
that
by
such
a
step
he
must
at
once
break
with
the
emperor
and
expose
his
states
to
his
future
vengeance
the
elector
struggle
with
himself
was
long
and
violent
but
pusillanimity
and
for
awhile
prevailed
unmoved
by
the
fate
of
magdeburg
cold
in
the
cause
of
religion
and
the
liberties
of
germany
he
saw
nothing
but
his
own
danger
and
this
anxiety
was
greatly
stimulated
by
his
minister
von
schwartzenburgh
who
was
secretly
in
the
pay
of
austria
in
the
mean
time
the
swedish
troops
approached
berlin
and
the
king
took
up
his
residence
with
the
elector
when
he
witnessed
the
timorous
hesitation
of
that
prince
he
could
not
restrain
his
indignation
my
road
is
to
magdeburg
said
he
not
for
my
own
advantage
but
for
that
of
the
protestant
religion
if
no
one
will
stand
by
me
i
shall
immediately
retreat
conclude
a
peace
with
the
emperor
and
return
to
stockholm
i
am
convinced
that
ferdinand
will
readily
grant
me
whatever
conditions
i
may
require
but
if
magdeburg
is
once
lost
and
the
emperor
relieved
from
all
fear
of
me
then
it
is
for
you
to
look
to
yourselves
and
the
consequences
this
timely
threat
and
perhaps
too
the
aspect
of
the
swedish
army
which
was
strong
enough
to
obtain
by
force
what
was
refused
to
entreaty
brought
at
last
the
elector
to
his
senses
and
spandau
was
delivered
into
the
hands
of
the
swedes
the
king
had
now
two
routes
to
magdeburg
one
westward
led
through
an
exhausted
country
and
filled
with
the
enemy
troops
who
might
dispute
with
him
the
passage
of
the
elbe
the
other
more
to
the
southward
by
dessau
and
wittenberg
where
bridges
were
to
be
found
for
crossing
the
elbe
and
where
supplies
could
easily
be
drawn
from
saxony
but
he
could
not
avail
himself
of
the
latter
without
the
consent
of
the
elector
whom
gustavus
had
good
reason
to
distrust
before
setting
out
on
his
march
therefore
he
demanded
from
that
prince
a
free
passage
and
liberty
for
purchasing
provisions
for
his
troops
his
application
was
refused
and
no
remonstrances
could
prevail
on
the
elector
to
abandon
his
system
of
neutrality
while
the
point
was
still
in
dispute
the
news
of
the
dreadful
fate
of
magdeburg
arrived
tilly
announced
its
fall
to
the
protestant
princes
in
the
tone
of
a
conqueror
and
lost
no
time
in
making
the
most
of
the
general
consternation
the
influence
of
the
emperor
which
had
sensibly
declined
during
the
rapid
progress
of
gustavus
after
this
decisive
blow
rose
higher
than
ever
and
the
change
was
speedily
visible
in
the
imperious
tone
he
adopted
towards
the
protestant
states
the
decrees
of
the
confederation
of
leipzig
were
annulled
by
a
proclamation
the
convention
itself
suppressed
by
an
imperial
decree
and
all
the
refractory
states
threatened
with
the
fate
of
magdeburg
as
the
executor
of
this
imperial
mandate
tilly
immediately
ordered
troops
to
march
against
the
bishop
of
bremen
who
was
a
member
of
the
confederacy
and
had
himself
enlisted
soldiers
the
terrified
bishop
immediately
gave
up
his
forces
to
tilly
and
signed
the
revocation
of
the
acts
of
the
confederation
an
imperial
army
which
had
lately
returned
from
italy
under
the
command
of
count
furstenberg
acted
in
the
same
manner
towards
the
administrator
of
wirtemberg
the
duke
was
compelled
to
submit
to
the
edict
of
restitution
and
all
the
decrees
of
the
emperor
and
even
to
pay
a
monthly
subsidy
of
dollars
for
the
maintenance
of
the
imperial
troops
similar
burdens
were
inflicted
upon
ulm
and
nuremberg
and
the
entire
circles
of
franconia
and
swabia
the
hand
of
the
emperor
was
stretched
in
terror
over
all
germany
the
sudden
preponderance
more
in
appearance
perhaps
than
in
reality
which
he
had
obtained
by
this
blow
carried
him
beyond
the
bounds
even
of
the
moderation
which
he
had
hitherto
observed
and
misled
him
into
hasty
and
violent
measures
which
at
last
turned
the
wavering
resolution
of
the
german
princes
in
favour
of
gustavus
adolphus
injurious
as
the
immediate
consequences
of
the
fall
of
magdeburg
were
to
the
protestant
cause
its
remoter
effects
were
most
advantageous
the
past
surprise
made
way
for
active
resentment
despair
inspired
courage
and
the
german
freedom
rose
like
a
phoenix
from
the
ashes
of
magdeburg
among
the
princes
of
the
leipzig
confederation
the
elector
of
saxony
and
the
landgrave
of
hesse
were
the
most
powerful
and
until
they
were
disarmed
the
universal
authority
of
the
emperor
was
unconfirmed
against
the
landgrave
therefore
tilly
first
directed
his
attack
and
marched
straight
from
magdeburg
into
thuringia
during
this
march
the
territories
of
saxe
ernest
and
schwartzburg
were
laid
waste
and
frankenhausen
plundered
before
the
very
eyes
of
tilly
and
laid
in
ashes
with
impunity
the
unfortunate
peasant
paid
dear
for
his
master
attachment
to
the
interests
of
sweden
erfurt
the
key
of
saxony
and
franconia
was
threatened
with
a
siege
but
redeemed
itself
by
a
voluntary
contribution
of
money
and
provisions
from
thence
tilly
despatched
his
emissaries
to
the
landgrave
demanding
of
him
the
immediate
disbanding
of
his
army
a
renunciation
of
the
league
of
leipzig
the
reception
of
imperial
garrisons
into
his
territories
and
fortresses
with
the
necessary
contributions
and
the
declaration
of
friendship
or
hostility
such
was
the
treatment
which
a
prince
of
the
empire
was
compelled
to
submit
to
from
a
servant
of
the
emperor
but
these
extravagant
demands
acquired
a
formidable
weight
from
the
power
which
supported
them
and
the
dreadful
fate
of
magdeburg
still
fresh
in
the
memory
of
the
landgrave
tended
still
farther
to
enforce
them
admirable
therefore
was
the
intrepidity
of
the
landgrave
answer
to
admit
foreign
troops
into
his
capital
and
fortresses
the
landgrave
is
not
disposed
his
troops
he
requires
for
his
own
purposes
as
for
an
attack
he
can
defend
himself
if
general
tilly
wants
money
or
provisions
let
him
go
to
munich
where
there
is
plenty
of
both
the
irruption
of
two
bodies
of
imperial
troops
into
hesse
cassel
was
the
immediate
result
of
this
spirited
reply
but
the
landgrave
gave
them
so
warm
a
reception
that
they
could
effect
nothing
and
just
as
tilly
was
preparing
to
follow
with
his
whole
army
to
punish
the
unfortunate
country
for
the
firmness
of
its
sovereign
the
movements
of
the
king
of
sweden
recalled
him
to
another
quarter
gustavus
adolphus
had
learned
the
fall
of
magdeburg
with
deep
regret
and
the
demand
now
made
by
the
elector
george
william
in
terms
of
their
agreement
for
the
restoration
of
spandau
greatly
increased
this
feeling
the
loss
of
magdeburg
had
rather
augmented
than
lessened
the
reasons
which
made
the
possession
of
this
fortress
so
desirable
and
the
nearer
became
the
necessity
of
a
decisive
battle
between
himself
and
tilly
the
more
unwilling
he
felt
to
abandon
the
only
place
which
in
the
event
of
a
defeat
could
ensure
him
a
refuge
after
a
vain
endeavour
by
entreaties
and
representations
to
bring
over
the
elector
to
his
views
whose
coldness
and
lukewarmness
daily
increased
he
gave
orders
to
his
general
to
evacuate
spandau
but
at
the
same
time
declared
to
the
elector
that
he
would
henceforth
regard
him
as
an
enemy
to
give
weight
to
this
declaration
he
appeared
with
his
whole
force
before
berlin
i
will
not
be
worse
treated
than
the
imperial
generals
was
his
reply
to
the
ambassadors
whom
the
bewildered
elector
despatched
to
his
camp
your
master
has
received
them
into
his
territories
furnished
them
with
all
necessary
supplies
ceded
to
them
every
place
which
they
required
and
yet
by
all
these
concessions
he
could
not
prevail
upon
them
to
treat
his
subjects
with
common
humanity
all
that
i
require
of
him
is
security
a
moderate
sum
of
money
and
provisions
for
my
troops
in
return
i
promise
to
protect
his
country
and
to
keep
the
war
at
a
distance
from
him
on
these
points
however
i
must
insist
and
my
brother
the
elector
must
instantly
determine
to
have
me
as
a
friend
or
to
see
his
capital
plundered
this
decisive
tone
produced
a
due
impression
and
the
cannon
pointed
against
the
town
put
an
end
to
the
doubts
of
george
william
in
a
few
days
a
treaty
was
signed
by
which
the
elector
engaged
to
furnish
a
monthly
subsidy
of
dollars
to
leave
spandau
in
the
king
hands
and
to
open
custrin
at
all
times
to
the
swedish
troops
this
now
open
alliance
of
the
elector
of
brandenburg
with
the
swedes
excited
no
less
displeasure
at
vienna
than
did
formerly
the
similar
procedure
of
the
duke
of
pomerania
but
the
changed
fortune
which
now
attended
his
arms
obliged
the
emperor
to
confine
his
resentment
to
words
the
king
satisfaction
on
this
favourable
event
was
increased
by
the
agreeable
intelligence
that
griefswald
the
only
fortress
which
the
imperialists
still
held
in
pomerania
had
surrendered
and
that
the
whole
country
was
now
free
of
the
enemy
he
appeared
once
more
in
this
duchy
and
was
gratified
at
the
sight
of
the
general
joy
which
he
had
caused
to
the
people
a
year
had
elapsed
since
gustavus
first
entered
germany
and
this
event
was
now
celebrated
by
all
pomerania
as
a
national
festival
shortly
before
the
czar
of
moscow
had
sent
ambassadors
to
congratulate
him
to
renew
his
alliance
and
even
to
offer
him
troops
he
had
great
reason
to
rejoice
at
the
friendly
disposition
of
russia
as
it
was
indispensable
to
his
interests
that
sweden
itself
should
remain
undisturbed
by
any
dangerous
neighbour
during
the
war
in
which
he
himself
was
engaged
soon
after
his
queen
maria
eleonora
landed
in
pomerania
with
a
reinforcement
of
swedes
and
the
arrival
of
english
under
the
marquis
of
hamilton
requires
more
particular
notice
because
this
is
all
that
history
mentions
of
the
english
during
the
thirty
years
war
during
tilly
expedition
into
thuringia
pappenheim
commanded
in
magdeburg
but
was
unable
to
prevent
the
swedes
from
crossing
the
elbe
at
various
points
routing
some
imperial
detachments
and
seizing
several
posts
he
himself
alarmed
at
the
approach
of
the
king
of
sweden
anxiously
recalled
tilly
and
prevailed
upon
him
to
return
by
rapid
marches
to
magdeburg
tilly
encamped
on
this
side
of
the
river
at
wolmerstadt
gustavus
on
the
same
side
near
werben
not
far
from
the
confluence
of
the
havel
and
the
elbe
his
very
arrival
portended
no
good
to
tilly
the
swedes
routed
three
of
his
regiments
which
were
posted
in
villages
at
some
distance
from
the
main
body
carried
off
half
their
baggage
and
burned
the
remainder
tilly
in
vain
advanced
within
cannon
shot
of
the
king
camp
and
offered
him
battle
gustavus
weaker
by
than
his
adversary
prudently
declined
it
and
his
position
was
too
strong
for
an
attack
nothing
more
ensued
but
a
distant
cannonade
and
a
few
skirmishes
in
which
the
swedes
had
invariably
the
advantage
in
his
retreat
to
wolmerstadt
tilly
army
was
weakened
by
numerous
desertions
fortune
seemed
to
have
forsaken
him
since
the
carnage
of
magdeburg
the
king
of
sweden
on
the
contrary
was
followed
by
uninterrupted
success
while
he
himself
was
encamped
in
werben
the
whole
of
mecklenburg
with
the
exception
of
a
few
towns
was
conquered
by
his
general
tott
and
the
duke
adolphus
frederick
and
he
enjoyed
the
satisfaction
of
reinstating
both
dukes
in
their
dominions
he
proceeded
in
person
to
gustrow
where
the
reinstatement
was
solemnly
to
take
place
to
give
additional
dignity
to
the
ceremony
by
his
presence
the
two
dukes
with
their
deliverer
between
them
and
attended
by
a
splendid
train
of
princes
made
a
public
entry
into
the
city
which
the
joy
of
their
subjects
converted
into
an
affecting
solemnity
soon
after
his
return
to
werben
the
landgrave
of
hesse
cassel
appeared
in
his
camp
to
conclude
an
offensive
and
defensive
alliance
the
first
sovereign
prince
in
germany
who
voluntarily
and
openly
declared
against
the
emperor
though
not
wholly
uninfluenced
by
strong
motives
the
landgrave
bound
himself
to
act
against
the
king
enemies
as
his
own
to
open
to
him
his
towns
and
territory
and
to
furnish
his
army
with
provisions
and
necessaries
the
king
on
the
other
hand
declared
himself
his
ally
and
protector
and
engaged
to
conclude
no
peace
with
the
emperor
without
first
obtaining
for
the
landgrave
a
full
redress
of
grievances
both
parties
honourably
performed
their
agreement
hesse
cassel
adhered
to
the
swedish
alliance
during
the
whole
of
this
tedious
war
and
at
the
peace
of
westphalia
had
no
reason
to
regret
the
friendship
of
sweden
tilly
from
whom
this
bold
step
on
the
part
of
the
landgrave
was
not
long
concealed
despatched
count
fugger
with
several
regiments
against
him
and
at
the
same
time
endeavoured
to
excite
his
subjects
to
rebellion
by
inflammatory
letters
but
these
made
as
little
impression
as
his
troops
which
subsequently
failed
him
so
decidedly
at
the
battle
of
breitenfield
the
estates
of
hesse
could
not
for
a
moment
hesitate
between
their
oppressor
and
their
protector
but
the
imperial
general
was
far
more
disturbed
by
the
equivocal
conduct
of
the
elector
of
saxony
who
in
defiance
of
the
imperial
prohibition
continued
his
preparations
and
adhered
to
the
confederation
of
leipzig
at
this
conjuncture
when
the
proximity
of
the
king
of
sweden
made
a
decisive
battle
ere
long
inevitable
it
appeared
extremely
dangerous
to
leave
saxony
in
arms
and
ready
in
a
moment
to
declare
for
the
enemy
tilly
had
just
received
a
reinforcement
of
veteran
troops
under
furstenberg
and
confident
in
his
strength
he
hoped
either
to
disarm
the
elector
by
the
mere
terror
of
his
arrival
or
at
least
to
conquer
him
with
little
difficulty
before
quitting
his
camp
at
wolmerstadt
he
commanded
the
elector
by
a
special
messenger
to
open
his
territories
to
the
imperial
troops
either
to
disband
his
own
or
to
join
them
to
the
imperial
army
and
to
assist
in
conjunction
with
himself
in
driving
the
king
of
sweden
out
of
germany
while
he
reminded
him
that
of
all
the
german
states
saxony
had
hitherto
been
most
respected
he
threatened
it
in
case
of
refusal
with
the
most
destructive
ravages
but
tilly
had
chosen
an
unfavourable
moment
for
so
imperious
a
requisition
the
of
his
religious
and
political
confederates
the
destruction
of
magdeburg
the
excesses
of
the
imperialists
in
lusatia
all
combined
to
incense
the
elector
against
the
emperor
the
approach
too
of
gustavus
adolphus
however
slender
his
claims
were
to
the
protection
of
that
prince
tended
to
fortify
his
resolution
he
accordingly
forbade
the
quartering
of
the
imperial
soldiers
in
his
territories
and
announced
his
firm
determination
to
persist
in
his
warlike
preparations
however
surprised
he
should
be
he
added
to
see
an
imperial
army
on
its
march
against
his
territories
when
that
army
had
enough
to
do
in
watching
the
operations
of
the
king
of
sweden
nevertheless
he
did
not
expect
instead
of
the
promised
and
well
merited
rewards
to
be
repaid
with
ingratitude
and
the
ruin
of
his
country
to
tilly
deputies
who
were
entertained
in
a
princely
style
he
gave
a
still
plainer
answer
on
the
occasion
gentlemen
said
he
i
perceive
that
the
saxon
confectionery
which
has
been
so
long
kept
back
is
at
length
to
be
set
upon
the
table
but
as
it
is
usual
to
mix
with
it
nuts
and
garnish
of
all
kinds
take
care
of
your
teeth
tilly
instantly
broke
up
his
camp
and
with
the
most
frightful
devastation
advanced
upon
halle
from
this
place
he
renewed
his
demands
on
the
elector
in
a
tone
still
more
urgent
and
threatening
the
previous
policy
of
this
prince
both
from
his
own
inclination
and
the
persuasions
of
his
corrupt
ministers
had
been
to
promote
the
interests
of
the
emperor
even
at
the
expense
of
his
own
sacred
obligations
and
but
very
little
tact
had
hitherto
kept
him
inactive
all
this
but
renders
more
astonishing
the
infatuation
of
the
emperor
or
his
ministers
in
abandoning
at
so
critical
a
moment
the
policy
they
had
hitherto
adopted
and
by
extreme
measures
incensing
a
prince
so
easily
led
was
this
the
very
object
which
tilly
had
in
view
was
it
his
purpose
to
convert
an
equivocal
friend
into
an
open
enemy
and
thus
to
relieve
himself
from
the
necessity
of
that
indulgence
in
the
treatment
of
this
prince
which
the
secret
instructions
of
the
emperor
had
hitherto
imposed
upon
him
or
was
it
the
emperor
wish
by
driving
the
elector
to
open
hostilities
to
get
quit
of
his
obligations
to
him
and
so
cleverly
to
break
off
at
once
the
difficulty
of
a
reckoning
in
either
case
we
must
be
equally
surprised
at
the
daring
presumption
of
tilly
who
hesitated
not
in
presence
of
one
formidable
enemy
to
provoke
another
and
at
his
negligence
in
permitting
without
opposition
the
union
of
the
two
the
saxon
elector
rendered
desperate
by
the
entrance
of
tilly
into
his
territories
threw
himself
though
not
without
a
violent
struggle
under
the
protection
of
sweden
immediately
after
dismissing
tilly
first
embassy
he
had
despatched
his
arnheim
in
all
haste
to
the
camp
of
gustavus
to
solicit
the
prompt
assistance
of
that
monarch
whom
he
had
so
long
neglected
the
king
concealed
the
inward
satisfaction
he
felt
at
this
long
wished
for
result
i
am
sorry
for
the
elector
said
he
with
dissembled
coldness
to
the
ambassador
had
he
heeded
my
repeated
remonstrances
his
country
would
never
have
seen
the
face
of
an
enemy
and
magdeburg
would
not
have
fallen
now
when
necessity
leaves
him
no
alternative
he
has
recourse
to
my
assistance
but
tell
him
that
i
can
not
for
the
sake
of
the
elector
of
saxony
ruin
my
own
cause
and
that
of
my
confederates
what
pledge
have
i
for
the
sincerity
of
a
prince
whose
minister
is
in
the
pay
of
austria
and
who
will
abandon
me
as
soon
as
the
emperor
flatters
him
and
withdraws
his
troops
from
his
frontiers
tilly
it
is
true
has
received
a
strong
reinforcement
but
this
shall
not
prevent
me
from
meeting
him
with
confidence
as
soon
as
i
have
covered
my
rear
the
saxon
minister
could
make
no
other
reply
to
these
reproaches
than
that
it
was
best
to
bury
the
past
in
oblivion
he
pressed
the
king
to
name
the
conditions
on
which
he
would
afford
assistance
to
saxony
and
offered
to
guarantee
their
acceptance
i
require
said
gustavus
that
the
elector
shall
cede
to
me
the
fortress
of
wittenberg
deliver
to
me
his
eldest
sons
as
hostages
furnish
my
troops
with
three
months
pay
and
deliver
up
to
me
the
traitors
among
his
ministry
not
wittenberg
alone
said
the
elector
when
he
received
this
answer
and
hurried
back
his
minister
to
the
swedish
camp
not
wittenberg
alone
but
torgau
and
all
saxony
shall
be
open
to
him
my
whole
family
shall
be
his
hostages
and
if
that
is
insufficient
i
will
place
myself
in
his
hands
return
and
inform
him
i
am
ready
to
deliver
to
him
any
traitors
he
shall
name
to
furnish
his
army
with
the
money
he
requires
and
to
venture
my
life
and
fortune
in
the
good
cause
the
king
had
only
desired
to
test
the
sincerity
of
the
new
sentiments
convinced
of
it
he
now
retracted
these
harsh
demands
the
distrust
said
he
which
was
shown
to
myself
when
advancing
to
the
relief
of
magdeburg
had
naturally
excited
mine
the
elector
present
confidence
demands
a
return
i
am
satisfied
provided
he
grants
my
army
one
month
pay
and
even
for
this
advance
i
hope
to
indemnify
him
immediately
upon
the
conclusion
of
the
treaty
the
king
crossed
the
elbe
and
next
day
joined
the
saxons
instead
of
preventing
this
junction
tilly
had
advanced
against
leipzig
which
he
summoned
to
receive
an
imperial
garrison
in
hopes
of
speedy
relief
hans
von
der
pforta
the
commandant
made
preparations
for
his
defence
and
laid
the
suburb
towards
halle
in
ashes
but
the
ill
condition
of
the
fortifications
made
resistance
vain
and
on
the
second
day
the
gates
were
opened
tilly
had
fixed
his
head
quarters
in
the
house
of
a
the
only
one
still
standing
in
the
suburb
of
halle
here
he
signed
the
capitulation
and
here
too
he
arranged
his
attack
on
the
king
of
sweden
tilly
grew
pale
at
the
representation
of
the
death
head
and
cross
bones
with
which
the
proprietor
had
decorated
his
house
and
contrary
to
all
expectation
leipzig
experienced
moderate
treatment
meanwhile
a
council
of
war
was
held
at
torgau
between
the
king
of
sweden
and
the
elector
of
saxony
at
which
the
elector
of
brandenburg
was
also
present
the
resolution
which
should
now
be
adopted
was
to
decide
irrevocably
the
fate
of
germany
and
the
protestant
religion
the
happiness
of
nations
and
the
destiny
of
their
princes
the
anxiety
of
suspense
which
before
every
decisive
resolve
oppresses
even
the
hearts
of
heroes
appeared
now
for
a
moment
to
overshadow
the
great
mind
of
gustavus
adolphus
if
we
decide
upon
battle
said
he
the
stake
will
be
nothing
less
than
a
crown
and
two
electorates
fortune
is
changeable
and
the
inscrutable
decrees
of
heaven
may
for
our
sins
give
the
victory
to
our
enemies
my
kingdom
it
is
true
even
after
the
loss
of
my
life
and
my
army
would
still
have
a
hope
left
far
removed
from
the
scene
of
action
defended
by
a
powerful
fleet
a
frontier
and
a
warlike
population
it
would
at
least
be
safe
from
the
worst
consequences
of
a
defeat
but
what
chances
of
escape
are
there
for
you
with
an
enemy
so
close
at
hand
gustavus
adolphus
displayed
the
modest
diffidence
of
a
hero
whom
an
overweening
belief
of
his
own
strength
did
not
blind
to
the
greatness
of
his
danger
john
george
the
confidence
of
a
weak
man
who
knows
that
he
has
a
hero
by
his
side
impatient
to
rid
his
territories
as
soon
as
possible
of
the
oppressive
presence
of
two
armies
he
burned
for
a
battle
in
which
he
had
no
former
laurels
to
lose
he
was
ready
to
march
with
his
saxons
alone
against
leipzig
and
attack
tilly
at
last
gustavus
acceded
to
his
opinion
and
it
was
resolved
that
the
attack
should
be
made
without
delay
before
the
arrival
of
the
reinforcements
which
were
on
their
way
under
altringer
and
tiefenbach
the
united
swedish
and
saxon
armies
now
crossed
the
mulda
while
the
elector
returned
homeward
early
on
the
morning
of
the
september
the
hostile
armies
came
in
sight
of
each
other
tilly
who
since
he
had
neglected
the
opportunity
of
overpowering
the
saxons
before
their
union
with
the
swedes
was
disposed
to
await
the
arrival
of
the
reinforcements
had
taken
up
a
strong
and
advantageous
position
not
far
from
leipzig
where
he
expected
he
should
be
able
to
avoid
the
battle
but
the
impetuosity
of
pappenheim
obliged
him
as
soon
as
the
enemy
were
in
motion
to
alter
his
plans
and
to
move
to
the
left
in
the
direction
of
the
hills
which
run
from
the
village
of
wahren
towards
lindenthal
at
the
foot
of
these
heights
his
army
was
drawn
up
in
a
single
line
and
his
artillery
placed
upon
the
heights
behind
from
which
it
could
sweep
the
whole
extensive
plain
of
breitenfeld
the
swedish
and
saxon
army
advanced
in
two
columns
having
to
pass
the
lober
near
podelwitz
in
tilly
front
to
defend
the
passage
of
this
rivulet
pappenheim
advanced
at
the
head
of
cuirassiers
though
after
great
reluctance
on
the
part
of
tilly
and
with
express
orders
not
to
commence
a
battle
but
in
disobedience
to
this
command
pappenheim
attacked
the
vanguard
of
the
swedes
and
after
a
brief
struggle
was
driven
to
retreat
to
check
the
progress
of
the
enemy
he
set
fire
to
podelwitz
which
however
did
not
prevent
the
two
columns
from
advancing
and
forming
in
order
of
battle
on
the
right
the
swedes
drew
up
in
a
double
line
the
infantry
in
the
centre
divided
into
such
small
battalions
as
could
be
easily
and
rapidly
manoeuvred
without
breaking
their
order
the
cavalry
upon
their
wings
divided
in
the
same
manner
into
small
squadrons
interspersed
with
bodies
of
musqueteers
so
as
both
to
give
an
appearance
of
greater
numerical
force
and
to

was

apparently
to
separate

from
that
of

did
not

the

it
was

that

it
could
only
have
rendered
the

certainly
not

and
decisive
for

gustavus
had
crossed
the

to
court
danger
in

and
expose
his

and

to
the
caprice
of

the
two
greatest
generals
of
the
time
both
hitherto
invincible
were
now
to
be
matched
against
each
other
in
a
contest
which
both
had
long
avoided
and
on
this
field
of
battle
the
hitherto
untarnished
laurels
of
one
leader
must
droop
for
ever
the
two
parties
in
germany
had
beheld
the
approach
of
this
day
with
fear
and
trembling
and
the
whole
age
awaited
with
deep
anxiety
its
issue
and
posterity
was
either
to
bless
or
deplore
it
for
ever
tilly
usual
intrepidity
and
resolution
seemed
to
forsake
him
on
this
eventful
day
he
had
formed
no
regular
plan
for
giving
battle
to
the
king
and
he
displayed
as
little
firmness
in
avoiding
it
contrary
to
his
own
judgment
pappenheim
had
forced
him
to
action
doubts
which
he
had
never
before
felt
struggled
in
his
bosom
gloomy
forebodings
clouded
his
brow
the
shade
of
magdeburg
seemed
to
hover
over
him
a
cannonade
of
two
hours
commenced
the
battle
the
wind
which
was
from
the
west
blew
thick
clouds
of
smoke
and
dust
from
the
and
parched
fields
into
the
faces
of
the
swedes
this
compelled
the
king
insensibly
to
wheel
northwards
and
the
rapidity
with
which
this
movement
was
executed
left
no
time
to
the
enemy
to
prevent
it
tilly
at
last
left
his
heights
and
began
the
first
attack
upon
the
swedes
but
to
avoid
their
hot
fire
he
filed
off
towards
the
right
and
fell
upon
the
saxons
with
such
impetuosity
that
their
line
was
broken
and
the
whole
army
thrown
into
confusion
the
elector
himself
retired
to
eilenburg
though
a
few
regiments
still
maintained
their
ground
upon
the
field
and
by
a
bold
stand
saved
the
honour
of
saxony
scarcely
had
the
confusion
began
ere
the
croats
commenced
plundering
and
messengers
were
despatched
to
munich
and
vienna
with
the
news
of
the
victory
pappenheim
had
thrown
himself
with
the
whole
force
of
his
cavalry
upon
the
right
wing
of
the
swedes
but
without
being
able
to
make
it
waver
the
king
commanded
here
in
person
and
under
him
general
banner
seven
times
did
pappenheim
renew
the
attack
and
seven
times
was
he
repulsed
he
fled
at
last
with
great
loss
and
abandoned
the
field
to
his
conqueror
in
the
mean
time
tilly
having
routed
the
remainder
of
the
saxons
attacked
with
his
victorious
troops
the
left
wing
of
the
swedes
to
this
wing
the
king
as
soon
as
he
perceived
that
the
saxons
were
thrown
into
disorder
had
with
a
ready
foresight
detached
a
reinforcement
of
three
regiments
to
cover
its
flank
which
the
flight
of
the
saxons
had
left
exposed
gustavus
horn
who
commanded
here
showed
the
enemy
cuirassiers
a
spirited
resistance
which
the
infantry
interspersed
among
the
squadrons
of
horse
materially
assisted
the
enemy
were
already
beginning
to
relax
the
vigour
of
their
attack
when
gustavus
adolphus
appeared
to
terminate
the
contest
the
left
wing
of
the
imperialists
had
been
routed
and
the
king
division
having
no
longer
any
enemy
to
oppose
could
now
turn
their
arms
wherever
it
would
be
to
the
most
advantage
wheeling
therefore
with
his
right
wing
and
main
body
to
the
left
he
attacked
the
heights
on
which
the
enemy
artillery
was
planted
gaining
possession
of
them
in
a
short
time
he
turned
upon
the
enemy
the
full
fire
of
their
own
cannon
the
play
of
artillery
upon
their
flank
and
the
terrible
onslaught
of
the
swedes
in
front
threw
this
hitherto
invincible
army
into
confusion
a
sudden
retreat
was
the
only
course
left
to
tilly
but
even
this
was
to
be
made
through
the
midst
of
the
enemy
the
whole
army
was
in
disorder
with
the
exception
of
four
regiments
of
veteran
soldiers
who
never
as
yet
had
fled
from
the
field
and
were
resolved
not
to
do
so
now
closing
their
ranks
they
broke
through
the
thickest
of
the
victorious
army
and
gained
a
small
thicket
where
they
opposed
a
new
front
to
the
swedes
and
maintained
their
resistance
till
night
when
their
number
was
reduced
to
six
hundred
men
with
them
fled
the
wreck
of
tilly
army
and
the
battle
was
decided
amid
the
dead
and
the
wounded
gustavus
adolphus
threw
himself
on
his
knees
and
the
first
joy
of
his
victory
gushed
forth
in
fervent
prayer
he
ordered
his
cavalry
to
pursue
the
enemy
as
long
as
the
darkness
of
the
night
would
permit
the
pealing
of
the
set
the
inhabitants
of
all
the
neighbouring
villages
in
motion
and
utterly
lost
was
the
unhappy
fugitive
who
fell
into
their
hands
the
king
encamped
with
the
rest
of
his
army
between
the
field
of
battle
and
leipzig
as
it
was
impossible
to
attack
the
town
the
same
night
seven
thousand
of
the
enemy
were
killed
in
the
field
and
more
than
either
wounded
or
taken
prisoners
their
whole
artillery
and
camp
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
swedes
and
more
than
a
hundred
standards
and
colours
were
taken
of
the
saxons
about
had
fallen
while
the
loss
of
the
swedes
did
not
exceed
the
rout
of
the
imperialists
was
so
complete
that
tilly
on
his
retreat
to
halle
and
halberstadt
could
not
rally
above
men
or
pappenheim
more
than
so
rapidly
was
this
formidable
army
dispersed
which
so
lately
was
the
terror
of
italy
and
germany
tilly
himself
owed
his
escape
merely
to
chance
exhausted
by
his
wounds
he
still
refused
to
surrender
to
a
swedish
captain
of
horse
who
summoned
him
to
yield
but
who
when
he
was
on
the
point
of
putting
him
to
death
was
himself
stretched
on
the
ground
by
a
timely
but
more
grievous
than
danger
or
wounds
was
the
pain
of
surviving
his
reputation
and
of
losing
in
a
single
day
the
fruits
of
a
long
life
all
former
victories
were
as
nothing
since
he
had
failed
in
gaining
the
one
that
should
have
crowned
them
all
nothing
remained
of
all
his
past
exploits
but
the
general
execration
which
had
followed
them
from
this
period
he
never
recovered
his
cheerfulness
or
his
good
fortune
even
his
last
consolation
the
hope
of
revenge
was
denied
to
him
by
the
express
command
of
the
emperor
not
to
risk
a
decisive
battle
the
disgrace
of
this
day
is
to
be
ascribed
principally
to
three
mistakes
his
planting
the
cannon
on
the
hills
behind
him
his
afterwards
abandoning
these
heights
and
his
allowing
the
enemy
without
opposition
to
form
in
order
of
battle
but
how
easily
might
those
mistakes
have
been
rectified
had
it
not
been
for
the
cool
presence
of
mind
and
superior
genius
of
his
adversary
tilly
fled
from
halle
to
halberstadt
where
he
scarcely
allowed
time
for
the
cure
of
his
wounds
before
he
hurried
towards
the
weser
to
recruit
his
force
by
the
imperial
garrisons
in
lower
saxony
the
elector
of
saxony
had
not
failed
after
the
danger
was
over
to
appear
in
gustavus
camp
the
king
thanked
him
for
having
advised
a
battle
and
the
elector
charmed
at
his
friendly
reception
promised
him
in
the
first
transports
of
joy
the
roman
crown
gustavus
set
out
next
day
for
merseburg
leaving
the
elector
to
recover
leipzig
five
thousand
imperialists
who
had
collected
together
after
the
defeat
and
whom
he
met
on
his
march
were
either
cut
in
pieces
or
taken
prisoners
of
whom
again
the
greater
part
entered
into
his
service
merseburg
quickly
surrendered
halle
was
soon
after
taken
whither
the
elector
of
saxony
after
making
himself
master
of
leipzig
repaired
to
meet
the
king
and
to
concert
their
future
plan
of
operations
the
victory
was
gained
but
only
a
prudent
use
of
it
could
render
it
decisive
the
imperial
armies
were
totally
routed
saxony
free
from
the
enemy
and
tilly
had
retired
into
brunswick
to
have
followed
him
thither
would
have
been
to
renew
the
war
in
lower
saxony
which
had
scarcely
recovered
from
the
ravages
of
the
last
it
was
therefore
determined
to
carry
the
war
into
the
enemy
country
which
open
and
defenceless
as
far
as
vienna
invited
attack
on
their
right
they
might
fall
upon
the
territories
of
the
roman
catholic
princes
or
penetrate
on
the
left
into
the
hereditary
dominions
of
austria
and
make
the
emperor
tremble
in
his
palace
both
plans
were
resolved
on
and
the
question
that
now
remained
was
to
assign
its
respective
parts
gustavus
adolphus
at
the
head
of
a
victorious
army
had
little
resistance
to
apprehend
in
his
progress
from
leipzig
to
prague
vienna
and
presburg
as
to
bohemia
moravia
austria
and
hungary
they
had
been
stripped
of
their
defenders
while
the
oppressed
protestants
in
these
countries
were
ripe
for
a
revolt
ferdinand
was
no
longer
secure
in
his
capital
vienna
on
the
first
terror
of
surprise
would
at
once
open
its
gates
the
loss
of
his
territories
would
deprive
the
enemy
of
the
resources
by
which
alone
the
war
could
be
maintained
and
ferdinand
would
in
all
probability
gladly
accede
on
the
hardest
conditions
to
a
peace
which
would
remove
a
formidable
enemy
from
the
heart
of
his
dominions
this
bold
plan
of
operations
was
flattering
to
a
conqueror
and
success
perhaps
might
have
justified
it
but
gustavus
adolphus
as
prudent
as
he
was
brave
and
more
a
statesman
than
a
conqueror
rejected
it
because
he
had
a
higher
end
in
view
and
would
not
trust
the
issue
either
to
bravery
or
good
fortune
alone
by
marching
towards
bohemia
franconia
and
the
upper
rhine
would
be
left
to
the
elector
of
saxony
but
tilly
had
already
begun
to
recruit
his
shattered
army
from
the
garrisons
in
lower
saxony
and
was
likely
to
be
at
the
head
of
a
formidable
force
upon
the
weser
and
to
lose
no
time
in
marching
against
the
enemy
to
so
experienced
a
general
it
would
not
do
to
oppose
an
arnheim
of
whose
military
skill
the
battle
of
leipzig
had
afforded
but
equivocal
proof
and
of
what
avail
would
be
the
rapid
and
brilliant
career
of
the
king
in
bohemia
and
austria
if
tilly
should
recover
his
superiority
in
the
empire
animating
the
courage
of
the
roman
catholics
and
disarming
by
a
new
series
of
victories
the
allies
and
confederates
of
the
king
what
would
he
gain
by
expelling
the
emperor
from
his
hereditary
dominions
if
tilly
succeeded
in
conquering
for
that
emperor
the
rest
of
germany
could
he
hope
to
reduce
the
emperor
more
than
had
been
done
twelve
years
before
by
the
insurrection
of
bohemia
which
had
failed
to
shake
the
firmness
or
exhaust
the
resources
of
that
prince
and
from
which
he
had
risen
more
formidable
than
ever
less
brilliant
but
more
solid
were
the
advantages
which
he
had
to
expect
from
an
incursion
into
the
territories
of
the
league
in
this
quarter
his
appearance
in
arms
would
be
decisive
at
this
very
conjuncture
the
princes
were
assembled
in
a
diet
at
frankfort
to
deliberate
upon
the
edict
of
restitution
where
ferdinand
employed
all
his
artful
policy
to
persuade
the
intimidated
protestants
to
accede
to
a
speedy
and
disadvantageous
arrangement
the
advance
of
their
protector
could
alone
encourage
them
to
a
bold
resistance
and
disappoint
the
emperor
designs
gustavus
adolphus
hoped
by
his
presence
to
unite
the
discontented
princes
or
by
the
terror
of
his
arms
to
detach
them
from
the
emperor
party
here
in
the
centre
of
germany
he
could
paralyse
the
nerves
of
the
imperial
power
which
without
the
aid
of
the
league
must
soon
fall
here
in
the
neighbourhood
of
france
he
could
watch
the
movements
of
a
suspicious
ally
and
however
important
to
his
secret
views
it
was
to
cultivate
the
friendship
of
the
roman
catholic
electors
he
saw
the
necessity
of
making
himself
first
of
all
master
of
their
fate
in
order
to
establish
by
his
magnanimous
forbearance
a
claim
to
their
gratitude
he
accordingly
chose
the
route
to
franconia
and
the
rhine
and
left
the
conquest
of
bohemia
to
the
elector
of
saxony
book
iii
the
glorious
battle
of
leipzig
effected
a
great
change
in
the
conduct
of
gustavus
adolphus
as
well
as
in
the
opinion
which
both
friends
and
foes
entertained
of
him
successfully
had
he
confronted
the
greatest
general
of
the
age
and
had
matched
the
strength
of
his
tactics
and
the
courage
of
his
swedes
against
the
elite
of
the
imperial
army
the
most
experienced
troops
in
europe
from
this
moment
he
felt
a
firm
confidence
in
his
own
powers
has
always
been
the
parent
of
great
actions
in
all
his
subsequent
operations
more
boldness
and
decision
are
observable
greater
determination
even
amidst
the
most
unfavourable
circumstances
a
more
lofty
tone
towards
his
adversaries
a
more
dignified
bearing
towards
his
allies
and
even
in
his
clemency
something
of
the
forbearance
of
a
conqueror
his
natural
courage
was
farther
heightened
by
the
pious
ardour
of
his
imagination
he
saw
in
his
own
cause
that
of
heaven
and
in
the
defeat
of
tilly
beheld
the
decisive
interference
of
providence
against
his
enemies
and
in
himself
the
instrument
of
divine
vengeance
leaving
his
crown
and
his
country
far
behind
he
advanced
on
the
wings
of
victory
into
the
heart
of
germany
which
for
centuries
had
seen
no
foreign
conqueror
within
its
bosom
the
warlike
spirit
of
its
inhabitants
the
vigilance
of
its
numerous
princes
the
artful
confederation
of
its
states
the
number
of
its
strong
castles
its
many
and
broad
rivers
had
long
restrained
the
ambition
of
its
neighbours
and
frequently
as
its
extensive
frontier
had
been
attacked
its
interior
had
been
free
from
hostile
invasion
the
empire
had
hitherto
enjoyed
the
equivocal
privilege
of
being
its
own
enemy
though
invincible
from
without
even
now
it
was
merely
the
disunion
of
its
members
and
the
intolerance
of
religious
zeal
that
paved
the
way
for
the
swedish
invader
the
bond
of
union
between
the
states
which
alone
had
rendered
the
empire
invincible
was
now
dissolved
and
gustavus
derived
from
germany
itself
the
power
by
which
he
subdued
it
with
as
much
courage
as
prudence
he
availed
himself
of
all
that
the
favourable
moment
afforded
and
equally
at
home
in
the
cabinet
and
the
field
he
tore
asunder
the
web
of
the
artful
policy
with
as
much
ease
as
he
shattered
walls
with
the
thunder
of
his
cannon
uninterruptedly
he
pursued
his
conquests
from
one
end
of
germany
to
the
other
without
breaking
the
line
of
posts
which
commanded
a
secure
retreat
at
any
moment
and
whether
on
the
banks
of
the
rhine
or
at
the
mouth
of
the
lech
alike
maintaining
his
communication
with
his
hereditary
dominions
the
consternation
of
the
emperor
and
the
league
at
tilly
defeat
at
leipzig
was
scarcely
greater
than
the
surprise
and
embarrassment
of
the
allies
of
the
king
of
sweden
at
his
unexpected
success
it
was
beyond
both
their
expectations
and
their
wishes
annihilated
in
a
moment
was
that
formidable
army
which
while
it
checked
his
progress
and
set
bounds
to
his
ambition
rendered
him
in
some
measure
dependent
on
themselves
he
now
stood
in
the
heart
of
germany
alone
without
a
rival
or
without
an
adversary
who
was
a
match
for
him
nothing
could
stop
his
progress
or
check
his
pretensions
if
the
intoxication
of
success
should
tempt
him
to
abuse
his
victory
if
formerly
they
had
dreaded
the
emperor
irresistible
power
there
was
no
less
cause
now
to
fear
every
thing
for
the
empire
from
the
violence
of
a
foreign
conqueror
and
for
the
catholic
church
from
the
religious
zeal
of
a
protestant
king
the
distrust
and
jealousy
of
some
of
the
combined
powers
which
a
stronger
fear
of
the
emperor
had
for
a
time
repressed
now
revived
and
scarcely
had
gustavus
adolphus
merited
by
his
courage
and
success
their
confidence
when
they
began
covertly
to
circumvent
all
his
plans
through
a
continual
struggle
with
the
arts
of
enemies
and
the
distrust
of
his
own
allies
must
his
victories
henceforth
be
won
yet
resolution
penetration
and
prudence
made
their
way
through
all
impediments
but
while
his
success
excited
the
jealousy
of
his
more
powerful
allies
france
and
saxony
it
gave
courage
to
the
weaker
and
emboldened
them
openly
to
declare
their
sentiments
and
join
his
party
those
who
could
neither
vie
with
gustavus
adolphus
in
importance
nor
suffer
from
his
ambition
expected
the
more
from
the
magnanimity
of
their
powerful
ally
who
enriched
them
with
the
spoils
of
their
enemies
and
protected
them
against
the
oppression
of
their
stronger
neighbours
his
strength
covered
their
weakness
and
inconsiderable
in
themselves
they
acquired
weight
and
influence
from
their
union
with
the
swedish
hero
this
was
the
case
with
most
of
the
free
cities
and
particularly
with
the
weaker
protestant
states
it
was
these
that
introduced
the
king
into
the
heart
of
germany
these
covered
his
rear
supplied
his
troops
with
necessaries
received
them
into
their
fortresses
while
they
exposed
their
own
lives
in
his
battles
his
prudent
regard
to
their
national
pride
his
popular
deportment
some
brilliant
acts
of
justice
and
his
respect
for
the
laws
were
so
many
ties
by
which
he
bound
the
german
protestants
to
his
cause
while
the
crying
atrocities
of
the
imperialists
the
spaniards
and
the
troops
of
lorraine
powerfully
contributed
to
set
his
own
conduct
and
that
of
his
army
in
a
favourable
light
if
gustavus
adolphus
owed
his
success
chiefly
to
his
own
genius
at
the
same
time
it
must
be
owned
he
was
greatly
favoured
by
fortune
and
by
circumstances
two
great
advantages
gave
him
a
decided
superiority
over
the
enemy
while
he
removed
the
scene
of
war
into
the
lands
of
the
league
drew
their
youth
as
recruits
enriched
himself
with
booty
and
used
the
revenues
of
their
fugitive
princes
as
his
own
he
at
once
took
from
the
enemy
the
means
of
effectual
resistance
and
maintained
an
expensive
war
with
little
cost
to
himself
and
moreover
while
his
opponents
the
princes
of
the
league
divided
among
themselves
and
governed
by
different
and
often
conflicting
interests
acted
without
unanimity
and
therefore
without
energy
while
their
generals
were
deficient
in
authority
their
troops
in
obedience
the
operations
of
their
scattered
armies
without
concert
while
the
general
was
separated
from
the
lawgiver
and
the
statesman
these
several
functions
were
united
in
gustavus
adolphus
the
only
source
from
which
authority
flowed
the
sole
object
to
which
the
eye
of
the
warrior
turned
the
soul
of
his
party
the
inventor
as
well
as
the
executor
of
his
plans
in
him
therefore
the
protestants
had
a
centre
of
unity
and
harmony
which
was
altogether
wanting
to
their
opponents
no
wonder
then
if
favoured
by
such
advantages
at
the
head
of
such
an
army
with
such
a
genius
to
direct
it
and
guided
by
such
political
prudence
gustavus
adolphus
was
irresistible
with
the
sword
in
one
hand
and
mercy
in
the
other
he
traversed
germany
as
a
conqueror
a
lawgiver
and
a
judge
in
as
short
a
time
almost
as
the
tourist
of
pleasure
the
keys
of
towns
and
fortresses
were
delivered
to
him
as
if
to
the
native
sovereign
no
fortress
was
inaccessible
no
river
checked
his
victorious
career
he
conquered
by
the
very
terror
of
his
name
the
swedish
standards
were
planted
along
the
whole
stream
of
the
maine
the
lower
palatinate
was
free
the
troops
of
spain
and
lorraine
had
fled
across
the
rhine
and
the
moselle
the
swedes
and
hessians
poured
like
a
torrent
into
the
territories
of
mentz
of
wurtzburg
and
bamberg
and
three
fugitive
bishops
at
a
distance
from
their
sees
suffered
dearly
for
their
unfortunate
attachment
to
the
emperor
it
was
now
the
turn
for
maximilian
the
leader
of
the
league
to
feel
in
his
own
dominions
the
miseries
he
had
inflicted
upon
others
neither
the
terrible
fate
of
his
allies
nor
the
peaceful
overtures
of
gustavus
who
in
the
midst
of
conquest
ever
held
out
the
hand
of
friendship
could
conquer
the
obstinacy
of
this
prince
the
torrent
of
war
now
poured
into
bavaria
like
the
banks
of
the
rhine
those
of
the
lecke
and
the
donau
were
crowded
with
swedish
troops
creeping
into
his
fortresses
the
defeated
elector
abandoned
to
the
ravages
of
the
foe
his
dominions
hitherto
unscathed
by
war
and
on
which
the
bigoted
violence
of
the
bavarians
seemed
to
invite
retaliation
munich
itself
opened
its
gates
to
the
invincible
monarch
and
the
fugitive
palatine
frederick
in
the
forsaken
residence
of
his
rival
consoled
himself
for
a
time
for
the
loss
of
his
dominions
while
gustavus
adolphus
was
extending
his
conquests
in
the
south
his
generals
and

were
gaining

triumphs
in

abandoned

retired

rendered

in

while
to
the
eastward
the
whole

was
conquered
by
the
saxons
the
turks
were
preparing
to
attack
hungary
and
in
the
heart
of
austria
a
dangerous
insurrection
was
threatened
in
vain
did
the
emperor
look
around
to
the
courts
of
europe
for
support
in
vain
did
he
summon
the
spaniards
to
his
assistance
for
the
bravery
of
the
flemings
afforded
them
ample
employment
beyond
the
rhine
in
vain
did
he
call
upon
the
roman
court
and
the
whole
church
to
come
to
his
rescue
the
offended
pope
sported
in
pompous
processions
and
idle
anathemas
with
the
embarrassments
of
ferdinand
and
instead
of
the
desired
subsidy
he
was
shown
the
devastation
of
mantua
on
all
sides
of
his
extensive
monarchy
hostile
arms
surrounded
him
with
the
states
of
the
league
now
overrun
by
the
enemy
those
ramparts
were
thrown
down
behind
which
austria
had
so
long
defended
herself
and
the
embers
of
war
were
now
smouldering
upon
her
unguarded
frontiers
his
most
zealous
allies
were
disarmed
maximilian
of
bavaria
his
firmest
support
was
scarce
able
to
defend
himself
his
armies
weakened
by
desertion
and
repeated
defeat
and
dispirited
by
continued
misfortunes
had
unlearnt
under
beaten
generals
that
warlike
impetuosity
which
as
it
is
the
consequence
so
it
is
the
guarantee
of
success
the
danger
was
extreme
and
extraordinary
means
alone
could
raise
the
imperial
power
from
the
degradation
into
which
it
was
fallen
the
most
urgent
want
was
that
of
a
general
and
the
only
one
from
whom
he
could
hope
for
the
revival
of
his
former
splendour
had
been
removed
from
his
command
by
an
envious
cabal
so
low
had
the
emperor
now
fallen
that
he
was
forced
to
make
the
most
humiliating
proposals
to
his
injured
subject
and
servant
and
meanly
to
press
upon
the
imperious
duke
of
friedland
the
acceptance
of
the
powers
which
no
less
meanly
had
been
taken
from
him
a
new
spirit
began
from
this
moment
to
animate
the
expiring
body
of
austria
and
a
sudden
change
in
the
aspect
of
affairs
bespoke
the
firm
hand
which
guided
them
to
the
absolute
king
of
sweden
a
general
equally
absolute
was
now
opposed
and
one
victorious
hero
was
confronted
with
another
both
armies
were
again
to
engage
in
the
doubtful
struggle
and
the
prize
of
victory
already
almost
secured
in
the
hands
of
gustavus
adolphus
was
to
be
the
object
of
another
and
a
severer
trial
the
storm
of
war
gathered
around
nuremberg
before
its
walls
the
hostile
armies
encamped
gazing
on
each
other
with
dread
and
respect
longing
for
and
yet
shrinking
from
the
moment
that
was
to
close
them
together
in
the
shock
of
battle
the
eyes
of
europe
turned
to
the
scene
in
curiosity
and
alarm
while
nuremberg
in
dismay
expected
soon
to
lend
its
name
to
a
more
decisive
battle
than
that
of
leipzig
suddenly
the
clouds
broke
and
the
storm
rolled
away
from
franconia
to
burst
upon
the
plains
of
saxony
near
lutzen
fell
the
thunder
that
had
menaced
nuremberg
the
victory
half
lost
was
purchased
by
the
death
of
the
king
fortune
which
had
never
forsaken
him
in
his
lifetime
favoured
the
king
of
sweden
even
in
his
death
with
the
rare
privilege
of
falling
in
the
fulness
of
his
glory
and
an
untarnished
fame
by
a
timely
death
his
protecting
genius
rescued
him
from
the
inevitable
fate
of
man
that
of
forgetting
moderation
in
the
intoxication
of
success
and
justice
in
the
plenitude
of
power
it
may
be
doubted
whether
had
he
lived
longer
he
would
still
have
deserved
the
tears
which
germany
shed
over
his
grave
or
maintained
his
title
to
the
admiration
with
which
posterity
regards
him
as
the
first
and
only
just
conqueror
that
the
world
has
produced
the
untimely
fall
of
their
great
leader
seemed
to
threaten
the
ruin
of
his
party
but
to
the
power
which
rules
the
world
no
loss
of
a
single
man
is
irreparable
as
the
helm
of
war
dropped
from
the
hand
of
the
falling
hero
it
was
seized
by
two
great
statesmen
oxenstiern
and
richelieu
destiny
still
pursued
its
relentless
course
and
for
full
sixteen
years
longer
the
flames
of
war
blazed
over
the
ashes
of
the
king
and
soldier
i
may
now
be
permitted
to
take
a
cursory
retrospect
of
gustavus
adolphus
in
his
victorious
career
glance
at
the
scene
in
which
he
alone
was
the
great
actor
and
then
when
austria
becomes
reduced
to
extremity
by
the
successes
of
the
swedes
and
by
a
series
of
disasters
is
driven
to
the
most
humiliating
and
desperate
expedients
to
return
to
the
history
of
the
emperor
as
soon
as
the
plan
of
operations
had
been
concerted
at
halle
between
the
king
of
sweden
and
the
elector
of
saxony
as
soon
as
the
alliance
had
been
concluded
with
the
neighbouring
princes
of
weimar
and
anhalt
and
preparations
made
for
the
recovery
of
the
bishopric
of
magdeburg
the
king
began
his
march
into
the
empire
he
had
here
no
despicable
foe
to
contend
with
within
the
empire
the
emperor
was
still
powerful
throughout
franconia
swabia
and
the
palatinate
imperial
garrisons
were
posted
with
whom
the
possession
of
every
place
of
importance
must
be
disputed
sword
in
hand
on
the
rhine
he
was
opposed
by
the
spaniards
who
had
overrun
the
territory
of
the
banished
elector
palatine
seized
all
its
strong
places
and
would
everywhere
dispute
with
him
the
passage
over
that
river
on
his
rear
was
tilly
who
was
fast
recruiting
his
force
and
would
soon
be
joined
by
the
auxiliaries
from
lorraine
every
papist
presented
an
inveterate
foe
while
his
connexion
with
france
did
not
leave
him
at
liberty
to
act
with
freedom
against
the
roman
catholics
gustavus
had
foreseen
all
these
obstacles
but
at
the
same
time
the
means
by
which
they
were
to
be
overcome
the
strength
of
the
imperialists
was
broken
and
divided
among
different
garrisons
while
he
would
bring
against
them
one
by
one
his
whole
united
force
if
he
was
to
be
opposed
by
the
fanaticism
of
the
roman
catholics
and
the
awe
in
which
the
lesser
states
regarded
the
emperor
power
he
might
depend
on
the
active
support
of
the
protestants
and
their
hatred
to
austrian
oppression
the
ravages
of
the
imperialist
and
spanish
troops
also
powerfully
aided
him
in
these
quarters
where
the
husbandman
and
citizen
sighed
alike
for
a
deliverer
and
where
the
mere
change
of
yoke
seemed
to
promise
a
relief
emissaries
were
despatched
to
gain
over
to
the
swedish
side
the
principal
free
cities
particularly
nuremberg
and
frankfort
the
first
that
lay
in
the
king
march
and
which
he
could
not
leave
unoccupied
in
his
rear
was
erfurt
here
the
protestant
party
among
the
citizens
opened
to
him
without
a
blow
the
gates
of
the
town
and
the
citadel
from
the
inhabitants
of
this
as
of
every
important
place
which
afterwards
submitted
he
exacted
an
oath
of
allegiance
while
he
secured
its
possession
by
a
sufficient
garrison
to
his
ally
duke
william
of
weimar
he
intrusted
the
command
of
an
army
to
be
raised
in
thuringia
he
also
left
his
queen
in
erfurt
and
promised
to
increase
its
privileges
the
swedish
army
now
crossed
the
thuringian
forest
in
two
columns
by
gotha
and
arnstadt
and
having
delivered
in
its
march
the
county
of
henneberg
from
the
imperialists
formed
a
junction
on
the
third
day
near
koenigshofen
on
the
frontiers
of
franconia
francis
bishop
of
wurtzburg
the
bitter
enemy
of
the
protestants
and
the
most
zealous
member
of
the
league
was
the
first
to
feel
the
indignation
of
gustavus
adolphus
a
few
threats
gained
for
the
swedes
possession
of
his
fortress
of
koenigshofen
and
with
it
the
key
of
the
whole
province
at
the
news
of
this
rapid
conquest
dismay
seized
all
the
roman
catholic
towns
of
the
circle
the
bishops
of
wurtzburg
and
bamberg
trembled
in
their
castles
they
already
saw
their
sees
tottering
their
churches
profaned
and
their
religion
degraded
the
malice
of
his
enemies
had
circulated
the
most
frightful
representations
of
the
persecuting
spirit
and
the
mode
of
warfare
pursued
by
the
swedish
king
and
his
soldiers
which
neither
the
repeated
assurances
of
the
king
nor
the
most
splendid
examples
of
humanity
and
toleration
ever
entirely
effaced
many
feared
to
suffer
at
the
hands
of
another
what
in
similar
circumstances
they
were
conscious
of
inflicting
themselves
many
of
the
richest
roman
catholics
hastened
to
secure
by
flight
their
property
their
religion
and
their
persons
from
the
sanguinary
fanaticism
of
the
swedes
the
bishop
himself
set
the
example
in
the
midst
of
the
alarm
which
his
bigoted
zeal
had
caused
he
abandoned
his
dominions
and
fled
to
paris
to
excite
if
possible
the
french
ministry
against
the
common
enemy
of
religion
the
further
progress
of
gustavus
adolphus
in
the
ecclesiastical
territories
agreed
with
this
brilliant
commencement
schweinfurt
and
soon
afterwards
wurtzburg
abandoned
by
their
imperial
garrisons
surrendered
but
marienberg
he
was
obliged
to
carry
by
storm
in
this
place
which
was
believed
to
be
impregnable
the
enemy
had
collected
a
large
store
of
provisions
and
ammunition
all
of
which
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
swedes
the
king
found
a
valuable
prize
in
the
library
of
the
jesuits
which
he
sent
to
upsal
while
his
soldiers
found
a
still
more
agreeable
one
in
the
prelate
cellars
his
treasures
the
bishop
had
in
good
time
removed
the
whole
bishopric
followed

the
king
compelled
all
the
bishop
subjects
to
swear
allegiance
to
himself
and
in
the
absence
of
the
lawful
sovereign
appointed
a
regency
one
half
of
whose
members
were
protestants
in
every
roman
catholic
town
which
gustavus
took
he
opened
the
churches
to
the

people
but
without
retaliating
on
the
papists
the
cruelties
which
they
had
practised
on
the
former
on
such
only
as
sword
in

refused
to

were
the
fearful
rights
of

for
the
occasional
acts
of
violence
committed
by
a
few
of
the
more
lawless
soldiers
in
the
blind
rage
of
the
first
attack
their
humane
leader
is
not
justly
responsible
those
who
were
peaceably
disposed
or
defenceless
were
treated
with
mildness
it
was
a
sacred
principle
of
gustavus
to
spare
the
blood
of
his
enemies
as
well
as
that
of
his
own
troops
on
the
first
news
of
the
swedish
irruption
the
bishop
of
wurtzburg
without
regarding
the
treaty
which
he
had
entered
into
with
the
king
of
sweden
had
earnestly
pressed
the
general
of
the
league
to
hasten
to
the
assistance
of
the
bishopric
that
defeated
commander
had
in
the
mean
time
collected
on
the
weser
the
shattered
remnant
of
his
army
reinforced
himself
from
the
garrisons
of
lower
saxony
and
effected
a
junction
in
hesse
with
altringer
and
fugger
who
commanded
under
him
again
at
the
head
of
a
considerable
force
tilly
burned
with
impatience
to
wipe
out
the
stain
of
his
first
defeat
by
a
splendid
victory
from
his
camp
at
fulda
whither
he
had
marched
with
his
army
he
earnestly
requested
permission
from
the
duke
of
bavaria
to
give
battle
to
gustavus
adolphus
but
in
the
event
of
tilly
defeat
the
league
had
no
second
army
to
fall
back
upon
and
maximilian
was
too
cautious
to
risk
again
the
fate
of
his
party
on
a
single
battle
with
tears
in
his
eyes
tilly
read
the
commands
of
his
superior
which
compelled
him
to
inactivity
thus
his
march
to
franconia
was
delayed
and
gustavus
adolphus
gained
time
to
overrun
the
whole
bishopric
it
was
in
vain
that
tilly
reinforced
at
aschaffenburg
by
a
body
of
men
from
lorraine
marched
with
an
overwhelming
force
to
the
relief
of
wurtzburg
the
town
and
citadel
were
already
in
the
hands
of
the
swedes
and
maximilian
of
bavaria
was
generally
blamed
and
not
without
cause
perhaps
for
having
by
his
scruples
occasioned
the
loss
of
the
bishopric
commanded
to
avoid
a
battle
tilly
contented
himself
with
checking
the
farther
advance
of
the
enemy
but
he
could
save
only
a
few
of
the
towns
from
the
impetuosity
of
the
swedes
baffled
in
an
attempt
to
reinforce
the
weak
garrison
of
hanau
which
it
was
highly
important
to
the
swedes
to
gain
he
crossed
the
maine
near
seligenstadt
and
took
the
direction
of
the
bergstrasse
to
protect
the
palatinate
from
the
conqueror
tilly
however
was
not
the
sole
enemy
whom
gustavus
adolphus
met
in
franconia
and
drove
before
him
charles
duke
of
lorraine
celebrated
in
the
annals
of
the
time
for
his
unsteadiness
of
character
his
vain
projects
and
his
misfortunes
ventured
to
raise
a
weak
arm
against
the
swedish
hero
in
the
hope
of
obtaining
from
the
emperor
the
electoral
dignity
deaf
to
the
suggestions
of
a
rational
policy
he
listened
only
to
the
dictates
of
heated
ambition
by
supporting
the
emperor
he
exasperated
france
his
formidable
neighbour
and
in
the
pursuit
of
a
visionary
phantom
in
another
country
left
undefended
his
own
dominions
which
were
instantly
overrun
by
a
french
army
austria
willingly
conceded
to
him
as
well
as
to
the
other
princes
of
the
league
the
honour
of
being
ruined
in
her
cause
intoxicated
with
vain
hopes
this
prince
collected
a
force
of
men
which
he
proposed
to
lead
in
person
against
the
swedes
if
these
troops
were
deficient
in
discipline
and
courage
they
were
at
least
attractive
by
the
splendour
of
their
accoutrements
and
however
sparing
they
were
of
their
prowess
against
the
foe
they
were
liberal
enough
with
it
against
the
defenceless
citizens
and
peasantry
whom
they
were
summoned
to
defend
against
the
bravery
and
the
formidable
discipline
of
the
swedes
this
splendidly
attired
army
however
made
no
long
stand
on
the
first
advance
of
the
swedish
cavalry
a
panic
seized
them
and
they
were
driven
without
difficulty
from
their
cantonments
in
wurtzburg
the
defeat
of
a
few
regiments
occasioned
a
general
rout
and
the
scattered
remnant
sought
a
covert
from
the
swedish
valour
in
the
towns
beyond
the
rhine
loaded
with
shame
and
ridicule
the
duke
hurried
home
by
strasburg
too
fortunate
in
escaping
by
a
submissive
written
apology
the
indignation
of
his
conqueror
who
had
first
beaten
him
out
of
the
field
and
then
called
upon
him
to
account
for
his
hostilities
it
is
related
upon
this
occasion
that
in
a
village
on
the
rhine
a
peasant
struck
the
horse
of
the
duke
as
he
rode
past
exclaiming
haste
sir
you
must
go
quicker
to
escape
the
great
king
of
sweden
the
example
of
his
neighbours
misfortunes
had
taught
the
bishop
of
bamberg
prudence
to
avert
the
plundering
of
his
territories
he
made
offers
of
peace
though
these
were
intended
only
to
delay
the
king
course
till
the
arrival
of
assistance
gustavus
adolphus
too
honourable
himself
to
suspect
dishonesty
in
another
readily
accepted
the
bishop
proposals
and
named
the
conditions
on
which
he
was
willing
to
save
his
territories
from
hostile
treatment
he
was
the
more
inclined
to
peace
as
he
had
no
time
to
lose
in
the
conquest
of
bamberg
and
his
other
designs
called
him
to
the
rhine
the
rapidity
with
which
he
followed
up
these
plans
cost
him
the
loss
of
those
pecuniary
supplies
which
by
a
longer
residence
in
franconia
he
might
easily
have
extorted
from
the
weak
and
terrified
bishop
this
artful
prelate
broke
off
the
negotiation
the
instant
the
storm
of
war
passed
away
from
his
own
territories
no
sooner
had
gustavus
marched
onwards
than
he
threw
himself
under
the
protection
of
tilly
and
received
the
troops
of
the
emperor
into
the
very
towns
and
fortresses
which
shortly
before
he
had
shown
himself
ready
to
open
to
the
swedes
by
this
stratagem
however
he
only
delayed
for
a
brief
interval
the
ruin
of
his
bishopric
a
swedish
general
who
had
been
left
in
franconia
undertook
to
punish
the
perfidy
of
the
bishop
and
the
ecclesiastical
territory
became
the
seat
of
war
and
was
ravaged
alike
by
friends
and
foes
the
formidable
presence
of
the
imperialists
had
hitherto
been
a
check
upon
the
franconian
states
but
their
retreat
and
the
humane
conduct
of
the
swedish
king
emboldened
the
nobility
and
other
inhabitants
of
this
circle
to
declare
in
his
favour
nuremberg
joyfully
committed
itself
to
his
protection
and
the
franconian
nobles
were
won
to
his
cause
by
flattering
proclamations
in
which
he
condescended
to
apologize
for
his
hostile
appearance
in
the
dominions
the
fertility
of
franconia
and
the
rigorous
honesty
of
the
swedish
soldiers
in
their
dealings
with
the
inhabitants
brought
abundance
to
the
camp
of
the
king
the
high
esteem
which
the
nobility
of
the
circle
felt
for
gustavus
the
respect
and
admiration
with
which
they
regarded
his
brilliant
exploits
the
promises
of
rich
booty
which
the
service
of
this
monarch
held
out
greatly
facilitated
the
recruiting
of
his
troops
a
step
which
was
made
necessary
by
detaching
so
many
garrisons
from
the
main
body
at
the
sound
of
his
drums
recruits
flocked
to
his
standard
from
all
quarters
the
king
had
scarcely
spent
more
time
in
conquering
franconia
than
he
would
have
required
to
cross
it
he
now
left
behind
him
gustavus
horn
one
of
his
best
generals
with
a
force
of
men
to
complete
and
retain
his
conquest
he
himself
with
his
main
army
reinforced
by
the
late
recruits
hastened
towards
the
rhine
in
order
to
secure
this
frontier
of
the
empire
from
the
spaniards
to
disarm
the
ecclesiastical
electors
and
to
obtain
from
their
fertile
territories
new
resources
for
the
prosecution
of
the
war
following
the
course
of
the
maine
he
subjected
in
the
course
of
his
march
seligenstadt
aschaffenburg
steinheim
the
whole
territory
on
both
sides
of
the
river
the
imperial
garrisons
seldom
awaited
his
approach
and
never
attempted
resistance
in
the
meanwhile
one
of
his
colonels
had
been
fortunate
enough
to
take
by
surprise
the
town
and
citadel
of
hanau
for
whose
preservation
tilly
had
shown
such
anxiety
eager
to
be
free
of
the
oppressive
burden
of
the
imperialists
the
count
of
hanau
gladly
placed
himself
under
the
milder
yoke
of
the
king
of
sweden
gustavus
adolphus
now
turned
his
whole
attention
to
frankfort
for
it
was
his
constant
maxim
to
cover
his
rear
by
the
friendship
and
possession
of
the
more
important
towns
frankfort
was
among
the
free
cities
which
even
from
saxony
he
had
endeavoured
to
prepare
for
his
reception
and
he
now
called
upon
it
by
a
summons
from
offenbach
to
allow
him
a
free
passage
and
to
admit
a
swedish
garrison
willingly
would
this
city
have
dispensed
with
the
necessity
of
choosing
between
the
king
of
sweden
and
the
emperor
for
whatever
party
they
might
embrace
the
inhabitants
had
a
like
reason
to
fear
for
their
privileges
and
trade
the
emperor
vengeance
would
certainly
fall
heavily
upon
them
if
they
were
in
a
hurry
to
submit
to
the
king
of
sweden
and
afterwards
he
should
prove
unable
to
protect
his
adherents
in
germany
but
still
more
ruinous
for
them
would
be
the
displeasure
of
an
irresistible
conqueror
who
with
a
formidable
army
was
already
before
their
gates
and
who
might
punish
their
opposition
by
the
ruin
of
their
commerce
and
prosperity
in
vain
did
their
deputies
plead
the
danger
which
menaced
their
fairs
their
privileges
perhaps
their
constitution
itself
if
by
espousing
the
party
of
the
swedes
they
were
to
incur
the
emperor
displeasure
gustavus
adolphus
expressed
to
them
his
astonishment
that
when
the
liberties
of
germany
and
the
protestant
religion
were
at
stake
the
citizens
of
frankfort
should
talk
of
their
annual
fairs
and
postpone
for
temporal
interests
the
great
cause
of
their
country
and
their
conscience
he
had
he
continued
in
a
menacing
tone
found
the
keys
of
every
town
and
fortress
from
the
isle
of
rugen
to
the
maine
and
knew
also
where
to
find
a
key
to
frankfort
the
safety
of
germany
and
the
freedom
of
the
protestant
church
were
he
assured
them
the
sole
objects
of
his
invasion
conscious
of
the
justice
of
his
cause
he
was
determined
not
to
allow
any
obstacle
to
impede
his
progress
the
inhabitants
of
frankfort
he
was
well
aware
wished
to
stretch
out
only
a
finger
to
him
but
he
must
have
the
whole
hand
in
order
to
have
something
to
grasp
at
the
head
of
the
army
he
closely
followed
the
deputies
as
they
carried
back
his
answer
and
in
order
of
battle
awaited
near
saxenhausen
the
decision
of
the
council
if
frankfort
hesitated
to
submit
to
the
swedes
it
was
solely
from
fear
of
the
emperor
their
own
inclinations
did
not
allow
them
a
moment
to
doubt
between
the
oppressor
of
germany
and
its
protector
the
menacing
preparations
amidst
which
gustavus
adolphus
now
compelled
them
to
decide
would
lessen
the
guilt
of
their
revolt
in
the
eyes
of
the
emperor
and
by
an
appearance
of
compulsion
justify
the
step
which
they
willingly
took
the
gates
were
therefore
opened
to
the
king
of
sweden
who
marched
his
army
through
this
imperial
town
in
magnificent
procession
and
in
admirable
order
a
garrison
of
men
was
left
in
saxenhausen
while
the
king
himself
advanced
the
same
evening
with
the
rest
of
his
army
against
the
town
of
hoechst
in
mentz
which
surrendered
to
him
before
night
while
gustavus
was
thus
extending

upon

would
be
sufficient
to

oppressive

of

the

a
relation
of
gustavus
adolphus

not
content
even
with
this
but
assembled
troops
of
his
own
and
terrified
the
unfortunate
monks
and
priests
of
the
neighbourhood
but
was
quickly
compelled
by
the
imperial
general
count
gronsfeld
to
lay
down
his
arms
even
george

of
lunenburg
formerly
a
colonel
in

the
party
of

for

he
raised
several
regiments
and
by
occupying
the
attention
of
the
imperialists
in
lower
saxony
materially
assisted
him
but
more
important
service
was
rendered
to
the
king
by
the
landgrave
william
of

whose
victorious
arms
struck
with
terror
the

conclusion
of
the
alliance
between
the
landgrave
and
gustavus
adolphus
at
werben
two
imperial
generals
fugger

altringer
were
ordered
by
tilly
to
march
into
hesse
to
punish
the
landgrave
for
his
revolt
from

but
this
prince
had
as
firmly
withstood
the
arms
of
his
enemies
as
his
subjects
had
the
proclamations
of
tilly
inciting
them
to
rebellion
and
the
battle
of

relieved

of

absence
with
courage
and
resolution
in

short
time

alarmed

the
terrified

to

by
considerable
contributions
to
purchase
exemption
from

after
these
successful
enterprises
the
landgrave
united
his
victorious
army
with
that
of
gustavus
adolphus
and
concerted
with
him
at
frankfort
their
future
plan
of
operations
in
this
city
a
number
of
princes
and
ambassadors
were
assembled
to
congratulate
gustavus
on
his
success
and
either
to
conciliate
his
favour
or
to
appease
his
indignation
among
them
was
the
fugitive
king
of
bohemia
the
palatine
frederick
who
had
hastened
from
holland
to
throw
himself
into
the
arms
of
his
avenger
and
protector
gustavus
gave
him
the
unprofitable
honour
of
greeting
him
as
a
crowned
head
and
endeavoured
by
a
respectful
sympathy
to
soften
his
sense
of
his
misfortunes
but
great
as
the
advantages
were
which
frederick
had
promised
himself
from
the
power

good
fortune
of
his
protector

high
as
were
the
expectations
he
had
built
on
his
justice
and
magnanimity
the
chance
of
this
unfortunate
prince
reinstatement
in
his
kingdom
was
as
distant
as
ever
the
inactivity
and
contradictory
politics
of
the
english
court
had
abated
the
zeal
of
gustavus
adolphus
and
an
irritability
which
he
could
not
always
repress
made
him
on
this
occasion
forget
the
glorious
vocation
of
protector
of
the
oppressed
in
which
on
his
invasion
of
germany
he
had
so
loudly
announced
himself
the
terrors
of
the
king
irresistible
strength
and
the
near
prospect
of
his
vengeance
had
also
compelled
george
landgrave
of
hesse
darmstadt
to
a
timely
submission
his
connection
with
the
emperor
and
his
indifference
to
the
protestant
cause
were
no
secret
to
the
king
but
he
was
satisfied
with
laughing
at
so
impotent
an
enemy
as
the
landgrave
knew
his
own
strength
and
the
political
situation
of
germany
so
little
as
to
offer
himself
as
mediator
between
the
contending
parties
gustavus
used
jestingly
to
call
him
the
peacemaker
he
was
frequently
heard
to
say
when
at
play
he
was
winning
from
the
landgrave
that
the
money
afforded
double
satisfaction
as
it
was
imperial
coin
to
his
affinity
with
the
elector
of
saxony
whom
gustavus
had
cause
to
treat
with
forbearance
the
landgrave
was
indebted
for
the
favourable
terms
he
obtained
from
the
king
who
contented
himself
with
the
surrender
of
his
fortress
of
russelheim
and
his
promise
of
observing
a
strict
neutrality
during
the
war
the
counts
of
westerwald
and
wetteran
also
visited
the
king
in
frankfort
to
offer
him
their
assistance
against
the
spaniards
and
to
conclude
an
alliance
which
was
afterwards
of
great
service
to
him
the
town
of
frankfort
itself
had
reason
to
rejoice
at
the
presence
of
this
monarch
who
took
their
commerce
under
his
protection
and
by
the
most
effectual
measures
restored
the
fairs
which
had
been
greatly
interrupted
by
the
war
the
swedish
army
was
now
reinforced
by
ten
thousand
hessians
which
the
landgrave
of
casse
commanded
gustavus
adolphus
had
already
invested
koenigstein
kostheim
and
floersheim
surrendered
after
a
short
siege
he
was
in
command
of
the
maine
and
transports
were
preparing
with
all
speed
at
hoechst
to
carry
his
troops
across
the
rhine
these
preparations
filled
the
elector
of
mentz
anselm
casimir
with
consternation
and
he
no
longer
doubted
but
that
the
storm
of
war
would
next
fall
upon
him
as
a
partisan
of
the
emperor
and
one
of
the
most
active
members
of
the
league
he
could
expect
no
better
treatment
than
his
confederates
the
bishops
of
wurtzburg
and
bamberg
had
already
experienced
the
situation
of
his
territories
upon
the
rhine
made
it
necessary
for
the
enemy
to
secure
them
while
the
fertility
afforded
an
irresistible
temptation
to
a
necessitous
army
miscalculating
his
own
strength
and
that
of
his
adversaries
the
elector
flattered
himself
that
he
was
able
to
repel
force
by
force
and
weary
out
the
valour
of
the
swedes
by
the
strength
of
his
fortresses
he
ordered
the
fortifications
of
his
capital
to
be
repaired
with
all
diligence
provided
it
with
every
necessary
for
sustaining
a
long
siege
and
received
into
the
town
a
garrison
of
spaniards
under
don
philip
de
sylva
to
prevent
the
approach
of
the
swedish
transports
he
endeavoured
to
close
the
mouth
of
the
maine
by
driving
piles
and
sinking
large
heaps
of
stones
and
vessels
he
himself
however
accompanied
by
the
bishop
of
worms
and
carrying
with
him
his
most
precious
effects
took
refuge
in
cologne
and
abandoned
his
capital
and
territories
to
the
rapacity
of
a
tyrannical
garrison
but
these
preparations
which
bespoke
less
of
true
courage
than
of
weak
and
overweening
confidence
did
not
prevent
the
swedes
from
marching
against
mentz
and
making
serious
preparations
for
an
attack
upon
the
city
while
one
body
of
their
troops
poured
into
the
rheingau
routed
the
spaniards
who
remained
there
and
levied
contributions
on
the
inhabitants
another
laid
the
roman
catholic
towns
in
westerwald
and
wetterau
under
similar
contributions
the
main
army
had
encamped
at
cassel
opposite
mentz
and
bernhard
duke
of
weimar
made
himself
master
of
the
maeusethurm
and
the
castle
of
ehrenfels
on
the
other
side
of
the
rhine
gustavus
was
now
actively
preparing
to
cross
the
river
and
to
blockade
the
town
on
the
land
side
when
the
movements
of
tilly
in
franconia
suddenly
called
him
from
the
siege
and
obtained
for
the
elector
a
short
repose
the
danger
of
nuremberg
which
during
the
absence
of
gustavus
adolphus
on
the
rhine
tilly
had
made
a
show
of
besieging
and
in
the
event
of
resistance
threatened
with
the
cruel
fate
of
magdeburg
occasioned
the
king
suddenly
to
retire
from
before
mentz
lest
he
should
expose
himself
a
second
time
to
the
reproaches
of
germany
and
the
disgrace
of
abandoning
a
confederate
city
to
a
ferocious
enemy
he
hastened
to
its
relief
by
forced
marches
on
his
arrival
at
frankfort
however
he
heard
of
its
spirited
resistance
and
of
the
retreat
of
tilly
and
lost
not
a
moment
in
prosecuting
his
designs
against
mentz
failing
in
an
attempt
to
cross
the
rhine
at
cassel
under
the
cannon
of
the
besieged
he
directed
his
march
towards
the
bergstrasse
with
a
view
of
approaching
the
town
from
an
opposite
quarter
here
he
quickly
made
himself
master
of
all
the
places
of
importance
and
at
stockstadt
between
gernsheim
and
oppenheim
appeared
a
second
time
upon
the
banks
of
the
rhine
the
whole
of
the
bergstrasse
was
abandoned
by
the
spaniards
who
endeavoured
obstinately
to
defend
the
other
bank
of
the
river
for
this
purpose
they
had
burned
or
sunk
all
the
vessels
in
the
neighbourhood
and
arranged
a
formidable
force
on
the
banks
in
case
the
king
should
attempt
the
passage
at
that
place
on
this
occasion
the
king
impetuosity
exposed
him
to
great
danger
of
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
in
order
to
reconnoitre
the
opposite
bank
he
crossed
the
river
in
a
small
boat
he
had
scarcely
landed
when
he
was
attacked
by
a
party
of
spanish
horse
from
whose
hands
he
only
saved
himself
by
a
precipitate
retreat
having
at
last
with
the
assistance
of
the
neighbouring
fishermen
succeeded
in
procuring
a
few
transports
he
despatched
two
of
them
across
the
river
bearing
count
brahe
and
swedes
scarcely
had
this
officer
time
to
entrench
himself
on
the
opposite
bank
when
he
was
attacked
by
squadrons
of
spanish
dragoons
and
cuirassiers
superior
as
the
enemy
was
in
number
count
brahe
with
his
small
force
bravely
defended
himself
and
gained
time
for
the
king
to
support
him
with
fresh
troops
the
spaniards
at
last
retired
with
the
loss
of
men
some
taking
refuge
in
oppenheim
and
others
in
mentz
a
lion
of
marble
on
a
high
pillar
holding
a
naked
sword
in
his
paw
and
a
helmet
on
his
head
was
erected
seventy
years
after
the
event
to
point
out
to
the
traveller
the
spot
where
the
immortal
monarch
crossed
the
great
river
of
germany
gustavus
adolphus
now
conveyed
his
artillery
and
the
greater
part
of
his
troops
over
the
river
and
laid
siege
to
oppenheim
which
after
a
brave
resistance
was
on
the
december
carried
by
storm
five
hundred
spaniards
who
had
so
courageously
defended
the
place
fell
indiscriminately
a
sacrifice
to
the
fury
of
the
swedes
the
crossing
of
the
rhine
by
gustavus
struck
terror
into
the
spaniards
and
lorrainers
who
had
thought
themselves
protected
by
the
river
from
the
vengeance
of
the
swedes
rapid
flight
was
now
their
only
security
every
place
incapable
of
an
effectual
defence
was
immediately
abandoned
after
a
long
train
of
outrages
on
the
defenceless
citizens
the
troops
of
lorraine
evacuated
worms
which
before
their
departure
they
treated
with
wanton
cruelty
the
spaniards
hastened
to
shut
themselves
up
in
frankenthal
where
they
hoped
to
defy
the
victorious
arms
of
gustavus
adolphus
the
king
lost
no
time
in
prosecuting
his
designs
against
mentz
into
which
the
flower
of
the
spanish
troops
had
thrown
themselves
while
he
advanced
on
the
left
bank
of
the
rhine
the
landgrave
of
hesse
cassel
moved
forward
on
the
other
reducing
several
strong
places
on
his
march
the
besieged
spaniards
though
hemmed
in
on
both
sides
displayed
at
first
a
bold
determination
and
threw
for
several
days
a
shower
of
bombs
into
the
swedish
camp
which
cost
the
king
many
of
his
bravest
soldiers
but
notwithstanding
the
swedes
continually
gained
ground
and
had
at
last
advanced
so
close
to
the
ditch
that
they
prepared
seriously
for
storming
the
place
the
courage
of
the
besieged
now
began
to
droop
they
trembled
before
the
furious
impetuosity
of
the
swedish
soldiers
of
which
marienberg
in
wurtzburg
had
afforded
so
fearful
an
example
the
same
dreadful
fate
awaited
mentz
if
taken
by
storm
and
the
enemy
might
even
be
easily
tempted
to
revenge
the
carnage
of
magdeburg
on
this
rich
and
magnificent
residence
of
a
roman
catholic
prince
to
save
the
town
rather
than
their
own
lives
the
spanish
garrison
capitulated
on
the
fourth
day
and
obtained
from
the
magnanimity
of
gustavus
a
safe
conduct
to
luxembourg
the
greater
part
of
them
however
following
the
example
of
many
others
enlisted
in
the
service
of
sweden
on
the
december
the
king
made
his
entry
into
the
conquered
town
and
fixed
his
quarters
in
the
palace
of
the
elector
eighty
pieces
of
cannon
fell
into
his
hands
and
the
citizens
were
obliged
to
redeem
their
property
from
pillage
by
a
payment
of
florins
the
benefits
of
this
redemption
did
not
extend
to
the
jews
and
the
clergy
who
were
obliged
to
make
large
and
separate
contributions
for
themselves
the
library
of
the
elector
was
seized
by
the
king
as
his
share
and
presented
by
him
to
his
chancellor
oxenstiern
who
intended
it
for
the
academy
of
westerrah
but
the
vessel
in
which
it
was
shipped
to
sweden
foundered
at
sea
after
the
loss
of
mentz
misfortune
still
pursued
the
spaniards
on
the
rhine
shortly
before
the
capture
of
that
city
the
landgrave
of
hesse
cassel
had
taken
falkenstein
and
reifenberg
and
the
fortress
of
koningstein
surrendered
to
the
hessians
the
rhinegrave
otto
louis
one
of
the
king
generals
defeated
nine
spanish
squadrons
who
were
on
their
march
for
frankenthal
and
made
himself
master
of
the
most
important
towns
upon
the
rhine
from
boppart
to
bacharach
after
the
capture
of
the
fortress
of
braunfels
which
was
effected
by
the
count
of
wetterau
with
the
of
the
swedes
the
spaniards
quickly
lost
every
place
in
wetterau
while
in
the
palatinate
they
retained
few
places
besides
frankenthal
landau
and
kronweisenberg
openly
declared
for
the
swedes
spires
offered
troops
for
the
king
service
manheim
was
gained
through
the
prudence
of
the
duke
bernard
of
weimar
and
the
negligence
of
its
governor
who
for
this
misconduct
was
tried
before
the
council
of
war
at
heidelberg
and
beheaded
the
king
had
protracted
the
campaign
into
the
depth
of
winter
and
the
severity
of
the
season
was
perhaps
one
cause
of
the
advantage
his
soldiers
gained
over
those
of
the
enemy
but
the
exhausted
troops
now
stood
in
need
of
the
repose
of
winter
quarters
which
after
the
surrender
of
mentz
gustavus
assigned
to
them
in
its
neighbourhood
he
himself
employed
the
interval
of
inactivity
in
the
field
which
the
season
of
the
year
enjoined
in
arranging
with
his
chancellor
the
affairs
of
his
cabinet
in
treating
for
a
neutrality
with
some
of
his
enemies
and
adjusting
some
political
disputes
which
had
sprung
up
with
a
neighbouring
ally
he
chose
the
city
of
mentz
for
his
winter
quarters
and
the
settlement
of
these
state
affairs
and
showed
a
greater
partiality
for
this
town
than
seemed
consistent
with
the
interests
of
the
german
princes
or
the
shortness
of
his
visit
to
the
empire
not
content
with
strongly
fortifying
it
he
erected
at
the
opposite
angle
which
the
maine
forms
with
the
rhine
a
new
citadel
which
was
named
gustavusburg
from
its
founder
but
which
is
better
known
under
the
title
of
pfaffenraub
or
priests
plunder
alluding
to
the
means
by
which
the
expense
of
its
erection
had
been
defrayed
while
gustavus
adolphus
made
himself
master
of
the
rhine
and
threatened
the
three
neighbouring
electorates
with
his
victorious
arms
his
vigilant
enemies
in
paris
and
germain
made
use
of
every
artifice
to
deprive
him
of
the
support
of
france
and
if
possible
to
involve
him
in
a
war
with
that
power
by
his
sudden
and
equivocal
march
to
the
rhine
he
had
surprised
his
friends
and
furnished
his
enemies
with
the
means
of
exciting
a
distrust
of
his
intentions
after
the
conquest
of
wurtzburg
and
of
the
greater
part
of
franconia
the
road
into
bavaria
and
austria
lay
open
to
him
through
bamberg
and
the
upper
palatinate
and
the
expectation
was
as
general
as
it
was
natural
that
he
would
not
delay
to
attack
the
emperor
and
the
duke
of
bavaria
in
the
very
centre
of
their
power
and
by
the
reduction
of
his
two
principal
enemies
bring
the
war
immediately
to
an
end
but
to
the
surprise
of
both
parties
gustavus
left
the
path
which
general
expectation
had
thus
marked
out
for
him
and
instead
of
advancing
to
the
right
turned
to
the
left
to
make
the
less
important
and
more
innocent
princes
of
the
rhine
feel
his
power
while
he
gave
time
to
his
more
formidable
opponents
to
recruit
their
strength
nothing
but
the
paramount
design
of
reinstating
the
unfortunate
palatine
frederick
in
the
possession
of
his
territories
by
the
expulsion
of
the
spaniards
could
seem
to
account
for
this
strange
step
and
the
belief
that
gustavus
was
about
to
effect
that
restoration
silenced
for
a
while
the
suspicions
of
his
friends
and
the
calumnies
of
his
enemies
but
the
lower
palatinate
was
now
almost
entirely
cleared
of
the
enemy
and
yet
gustavus
continued
to
form
new
schemes
of
conquest
on
the
rhine
and
to
withhold
the
reconquered
country
from
the
palatine
its
rightful
owner
in
vain
did
the
english
ambassador
remind
him
of
what
justice
demanded
and
what
his
own
solemn
engagement
made
a
duty
of
honour
gustavus
replied
to
these
demands
with
bitter
complaints
of
the
inactivity
of
the
english
court
and
prepared
to
carry
his
victorious
standard
into
alsace
and
even
into
lorraine
a
distrust
of
the
swedish
monarch
was
now
loud
and
open
while
the
malice
of
his
enemies
busily
circulated
the
most
injurious
reports
as
to
his
intentions
richelieu
the
minister
of
louis
had
long
witnessed
with
anxiety
the
king
progress
towards
the
french
frontier
and
the
suspicious
temper
of
louis
rendered
him
but
too
accessible
to
the
evil
surmises
which
the
occasion
gave
rise
to
france
was
at
this
time
involved
in
a
civil
war
with
her
protestant
subjects
and
the
fear
was
not
altogether
groundless
that
the
approach
of
a
victorious
monarch
of
their
party
might
revive
their
drooping
spirit
and
encourage
them
to
a
more
desperate
resistance
this
might
be
the
case
even
if
gustavus
adolphus
was
far
from
showing
a
disposition
to
encourage
them
or
to
act
unfaithfully
towards
his
ally
the
king
of
france
but
the
vindictive
bishop
of
wurtzburg
who
was
anxious
to
avenge
the
loss
of
his
dominions
the
envenomed
rhetoric
of
the
jesuits
and
the
active
zeal
of
the
bavarian
minister
represented
this
dreaded
alliance
between
the
huguenots
and
the
swedes
as
an
undoubted
fact
and
filled
the
timid
mind
of
louis
with
the
most
alarming
fears
not
merely
chimerical
politicians
but
many
of
the
best
informed
roman
catholics
fully
believed
that
the
king
was
on
the
point
of
breaking
into
the
heart
of
france
to
make
common
cause
with
the
huguenots
and
to
overturn
the
catholic
religion
within
the
kingdom
fanatical
zealots
already
saw
him
with
his
army
crossing
the
alps
and
dethroning
the
viceregent
of
christ
in
italy
such
reports
no
doubt
soon
refute
themselves
yet
it
can
not
be
denied
that
gustavus
by
his
manoeuvres
on
the
rhine
gave
a
dangerous
handle
to
the
malice
of
his
enemies
and
in
some
measure
justified
the
suspicion
that
he
directed
his
arms
not
so
much
against
the
emperor
and
the
duke
of
bavaria
as
against
the
roman
catholic
religion
itself
the
general
clamour
of
discontent
which
the
jesuits
raised
in
all
the
catholic
courts
against
the
alliance
between
france
and
the
enemy
of
the
church
at
last
compelled
cardinal
richelieu
to
take
a
decisive
step
for
the
security
of
his
religion
and
at
once
to
convince
the
roman
catholic
world
of
the
zeal
of
france
and
of
the
selfish
policy
of
the
ecclesiastical
states
of
germany
convinced
that
the
views
of
the
king
of
sweden
like
his
own
aimed
solely
at
the
humiliation
of
the
power
of
austria
he
hesitated
not
to
promise
to
the
princes
of
the
league
on
the
part
of
sweden
a
complete
neutrality
immediately
they
abandoned
their
alliance
with
the
emperor
and
withdrew
their
troops
whatever
the
resolution
these
princes
should
adopt
richelieu
would
equally
attain
his
object
by
their
separation
from
the
austrian
interest
ferdinand
would
be
exposed
to
the
combined
attack
of
france
and
sweden
and
gustavus
adolphus
freed
from
his
other
enemies
in
germany
would
be
able
to
direct
his
undivided
force
against
the
hereditary
dominions
of
austria
in
that
event
the
fall
of
austria
was
inevitable
and
this
great
object
of
richelieu
policy
would
be
gained
without
injury
to
the
church
if
on
the
other
hand
the
princes
of
the
league
persisted
in
their
opposition
and
adhered
to
the
austrian
alliance
the
result
would
indeed
be
more
doubtful
but
still
france
would
have
sufficiently
proved
to
all
europe
the
sincerity
of
her
attachment
to
the
catholic
cause
and
performed
her
duty
as
a
member
of
the
roman
church
the
princes
of
the
league
would
then
appear
the
sole
authors
of
those
evils
which
the
continuance
of
the
war
would
unavoidably
bring
upon
the
roman
catholics
of
germany
they
alone
by
their
wilful
and
obstinate
adherence
to
the
emperor
would
frustrate
the
measures
employed
for
their
protection
involve
the
church
in
danger
and
themselves
in
ruin
richelieu
pursued
this
plan
with
greater
zeal
the
more
he
was
embarrassed
by
the
repeated
demands
of
the
elector
of
bavaria
for
assistance
from
france
for
this
prince
as
already
stated
when
he
first
began
to
entertain
suspicions
of
the
emperor
entered
immediately
into
a
secret
alliance
with
france
by
which
in
the
event
of
any
change
in
the
emperor
sentiments
he
hoped
to
secure
the
possession
of
the
palatinate
but
though
the
origin
of
the
treaty
clearly
showed
against
what
enemy
it
was
directed
maximilian
now
thought
proper
to
make
use
of
it
against
the
king
of
sweden
and
did
not
hesitate
to
demand
from
france
that
assistance
against
her
ally
which
she
had
simply
promised
against
austria
richelieu
embarrassed
by
this
conflicting
alliance
with
two
hostile
powers
had
no
resource
left
but
to
endeavour
to
put
a
speedy
termination
to
their
hostilities
and
as
little
inclined
to
sacrifice
bavaria
as
he
was
disabled
by
his
treaty
with
sweden
from
assisting
it
he
set
himself
with
all
diligence
to
bring
about
a
neutrality
as
the
only
means
of
fulfilling
his
obligations
to
both
for
this
purpose
the
marquis
of
breze
was
sent
as
his
plenipotentiary
to
the
king
of
sweden
at
mentz
to
learn
his
sentiments
on
this
point
and
to
procure
from
him
favourable
conditions
for
the
allied
princes
but
if
louis
xiii
had
powerful
motives
for
wishing
for
this
neutrality
gustavus
adolphus
had
as
grave
reasons
for
desiring
the
contrary
convinced
by
numerous
proofs
that
the
hatred
of
the
princes
of
the
league
to
the
protestant
religion
was
invincible
their
aversion
to
the
foreign
power
of
the
swedes
inextinguishable
and
their
attachment
to
the
house
of
austria
irrevocable
he
apprehended
less
danger
from
their
open
hostility
than
from
a
neutrality
which
was
so
little
in
unison
with
their
real
inclinations
and
moreover
as
he
was
constrained
to
carry
on
the
war
in
germany
at
the
expense
of
the
enemy
he
manifestly
sustained
great
loss
if
he
diminished
their
number
without
increasing
that
of
his
friends
it
was
not
surprising
therefore
if
gustavus
evinced
little
inclination
to
purchase
the
neutrality
of
the
league
by
which
he
was
likely
to
gain
so
little
at
the
expense
of
the
advantages
he
had
already
obtained
the
conditions
accordingly
upon
which
he
offered
to
adopt
the
neutrality
towards
bavaria
were
severe
and
suited
to
these
views
he
required
of
the
whole
league
a
full
and
entire
cessation
from
all
hostilities
the
recall
of
their
troops
from
the
imperial
army
from
the
conquered
towns
and
from
all
the
protestant
countries
the
reduction
of
their
military
force
the
exclusion
of
the
imperial
armies
from
their
territories
and
from
supplies
either
of
men
provisions
or
ammunition
hard
as
the
conditions
were
which
the
victor
thus
imposed
upon
the
vanquished
the
french
mediator
flattered
himself
he
should
be
able
to
induce
the
elector
of
bavaria
to
accept
them
in
order
to
give
time
for
an
accommodation
gustavus
had
agreed
to
a
cessation
of
hostilities
for
a
fortnight
but
at
the
very
time
when
this
monarch
was
receiving
from
the
french
agents
repeated
assurances
of
the
favourable
progress
of
the
negociation
an
intercepted
letter
from
the
elector
to
pappenheim
the
imperial
general
in
westphalia
revealed
the
perfidy
of
that
prince
as
having
no
other
object
in
view
by
the
whole
negociation
than
to
gain
time
for
his
measures
of
defence
far
from
intending
to
fetter
his
military
operations
by
a
truce
with
sweden
the
artful
prince
hastened
his
preparations
and
employed
the
leisure
which
his
enemy
afforded
him
in
making
the
most
active
dispositions
for
resistance
the
negociation
accordingly
failed
and
served
only
to
increase
the
animosity
of
the
bavarians
and
the
swedes
tilly
augmented
force
with
which
he
threatened
to
overrun
franconia
urgently
required
the
king
presence
in
that
circle
but
it
was
necessary
to
expel
previously
the
spaniards
from
the
rhine
and
to
cut
off
their
means
of
invading
germany
from
the
netherlands
with
this
view
gustavus
adolphus
had
made
an
offer
of
neutrality
to
the
elector
of
treves
philip
von
zeltern
on
condition
that
the
fortress
of
hermanstein
should
be
delivered
up
to
him
and
a
free
passage
granted
to
his
troops
through
coblentz
but
unwillingly
as
the
elector
had
beheld
the
spaniards
within
his
territories
he
was
still
less
disposed
to
commit
his
estates
to
the
suspicious
protection
of
a
heretic
and
to
make
the
swedish
conqueror
master
of
his
destinies
too
weak
to
maintain
his
independence
between
two
such
powerful
competitors
he
took
refuge
in
the
protection
of
france
with
his
usual
prudence
richelieu
profited
by
the
embarrassments
of
this
prince
to
augment
the
power
of
france
and
to
gain
for
her
an
important
ally
on
the
german
frontier
a
numerous
french
army
was
despatched
to
protect
the
territory
of
treves
and
a
french
garrison
was
received
into
ehrenbreitstein
but
the
object
which
had
moved
the
elector
to
this
bold
step
was
not
completely
gained
for
the
offended
pride
of
gustavus
adolphus
was
not
appeased
till
he
had
obtained
a
free
passage
for
his
troops
through
treves
pending
these
negociations
with
treves
and
france
the
king
generals
had
entirely
cleared
the
territory
of
mentz
of
the
spanish
garrisons
and
gustavus
himself
completed
the
conquest
of
this
district
by
the
capture
of
kreutznach
to
protect
these
conquests
the
chancellor
oxenstiern
was
left
with
a
division
of
the
army
upon
the
middle
rhine
while
the
main
body
under
the
king
himself
began
its
march
against
the
enemy
in
franconia
the
possession
of
this
circle
had
in
the
mean
time
been
disputed
with
variable
success
between
count
tilly
and
the
swedish
general
horn
whom
gustavus
had
left
there
with
men
and
the
bishopric
of
bamberg
in
particular
was
at
once
the
prize
and
the
scene
of
their
struggle
called
away
to
the
rhine
by
his
other
projects
the
king
had
left
to
his
general
the
chastisement
of
the
bishop
whose
perfidy
had
excited
his
indignation
and
the
activity
of
horn
justified
the
choice
in
a
short
time
he
subdued
the
greater
part
of
the
bishopric
and
the
capital
itself
abandoned
by
its
imperial
garrison
was
carried
by
storm
the
banished
bishop
urgently
demanded
assistance
from
the
elector
of
bavaria
who
was
at
length
persuaded
to
put
an
end
to
tilly
inactivity
fully
empowered
by
his
master
order
to
restore
the
bishop
to
his
possessions
this
general
collected
his
troops
who
were
scattered
over
the
upper
palatinate
and
with
an
army
of
men
advanced
upon
bamberg

resolved
to
maintain

conquest

against

overwhelming
force
horn
awaited
the
enemy
within
the
walls
of

was
obliged
to
yield
to
the
vanguard
of
tilly
what
he
had
thought
to
be
able
to
dispute
with
his
whole
army

panic

suddenly
seized

troops
and
which
no
presence

mind
of
their
general
could
check
opened
the
gates
to
the
enemy
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
the
troops

and
artillery
were
saved
the
reconquest
of
bamberg
was
the
fruit
of
this
victory
but
tilly
with
all
his
activity
was
unable
to
overtake
the
swedish
general
who
retired
in
good
order
behind
the
maine
the
king
appearance
in
franconia
and
his
junction
with
gustavus
horn
at
kitzingen
put
a
stop
to
tilly
conquests
and
compelled
him
to
provide
for
his
own
safety
by
a
rapid
retreat
the
king
made
a
general
review
of
his
troops
at
aschaffenburg
after
his
junction
with
gustavus
horn
banner
and
duke
william
of
weimar
they
amounted
to
nearly
men
his
progress
through
franconia
was
uninterrupted
for
tilly
far
too
weak
to
encounter
an
enemy
so
superior
in
numbers
had
retreated
by
rapid
marches
towards
the
danube
bohemia
and
bavaria
were
now
equally
near
to
the
king
and
uncertain
whither
his
victorious
course
might
be
directed
maximilian
could
form
no
immediate
resolution
the
choice
of
the
king
and
the
fate
of
both
provinces
now
depended
on
the
road
that
should
be
left
open
to
count
tilly
it
was
dangerous
during
the
approach
of
so
formidable
an
enemy
to
leave
bavaria
undefended
in
order
to
protect
austria
still
more
dangerous
by
receiving
tilly
into
bavaria
to
draw
thither
the
enemy
also
and
to
render
it
the
seat
of
a
destructive
war
the
cares
of
the
sovereign
finally
overcame
the
scruples
of
the
statesman
and
tilly
received
orders
at
all
hazards
to
cover
the
frontiers
of
bavaria
with
his
army
nuremberg
received
with
triumphant
joy
the
protector
of
the
protestant
religion
and
german
freedom
and
the
enthusiasm
of
the
citizens
expressed
itself
on
his
arrival
in
loud
transports
of
admiration
and
joy
even
gustavus
could
not
contain
his
astonishment
to
see
himself
in
this
city
which
was
the
very
centre
of
germany
where
he
had
never
expected
to
be
able
to
penetrate
the
noble
appearance
of
his
person
completed
the
impression
produced
by
his
glorious
exploits
and
the
condescension
with
which
he
received
the
congratulations
of
this
free
city
won
all
hearts
he
now
confirmed
the
alliance
he
had
concluded
with
it
on
the
shores
of
the
baltic
and
excited
the
citizens
to
zealous
activity
and
fraternal
unity
against
the
common
enemy
after
a
short
stay
in
nuremberg
he
followed
his
army
to
the
danube
and
appeared
unexpectedly
before
the
frontier
town
of
donauwerth
a
numerous
bavarian
garrison
defended
the
place
and
their
commander
rodolph
maximilian
duke
of
saxe
lauenburg
showed
at
first
a
resolute
determination
to
defend
it
till
the
arrival
of
tilly
but
the
vigour
with
which
gustavus
adolphus
prosecuted
the
siege
soon
compelled
him
to
take
measures
for
a
speedy
and
secure
retreat
which
amidst
a
tremendous
fire
from
the
swedish
artillery
he
successfully
executed
the
conquest
of
donauwerth
opened
to
the
king
the
further
side
of
the
danube
and
now
the
small
river
lech
alone
separated
him
from
bavaria
the
immediate
danger
of
his
dominions
aroused
all
maximilian
activity
and
however
little
he
had
hitherto
disturbed
the
enemy
progress
to
his
frontier
he
now
determined
to
dispute
as
resolutely
the
remainder
of
their
course
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
lech
near
the
small
town
of
rain
tilly
occupied
a
strongly
fortified
camp
which
surrounded
by
three
rivers
bade
defiance
to
all
attack
all
the
bridges
over
the
lech
were
destroyed
the
whole
course
of
the
stream
protected
by
strong
garrisons
as
far
as
augsburg
and
that
town
itself
which
had
long
betrayed
its
impatience
to
follow
the
example
of
nuremberg
and
frankfort
secured
by
a
bavarian
garrison
and
the
disarming
of
its
inhabitants
the
elector
himself
with
all
the
troops
he
could
collect
threw
himself
into
tilly
camp
as
if
all
his
hopes
centred
on
this
single
point
and
here
the
good
fortune
of
the
swedes
was
to
suffer
shipwreck
for
ever
gustavus
adolphus
after
subduing
the
whole
territory
of
augsburg
on
his
own
side
of
the
river
and
opening
to
his
troops
a
rich
supply
of
necessaries
from
that
quarter
soon
appeared
on
the
bank
opposite
the
bavarian
entrenchments
it
was
now
the
month
of
march
when
the
river
swollen
by
frequent
rains
and
the
melting
of
the
snow
from
the
mountains
of
the
tyrol
flowed
full
and
rapid
between
its
steep
banks
its
boiling
current
threatened
the
rash
assailants
with
certain
destruction
while
from
the
opposite
side
the
enemy
cannon
showed
their
murderous
mouths
if
in
despite
of
the
fury
both
of
fire
and
water
they
should
accomplish
this
almost
impossible
passage
a
fresh
and
vigorous
enemy
awaited
the
exhausted
troops
in
an
impregnable
camp
and
when
they
needed
repose
and
refreshment
they
must
prepare
for
battle
with
exhausted
powers
they
must
ascend
the
hostile
entrenchments
whose
strength
seemed
to
bid
defiance
to
every
assault
a
defeat
sustained
upon
this
shore
would
be
attended
with
inevitable
destruction
since
the
same
stream
which
impeded
their
advance
would
also
cut
off
their
retreat
if
fortune
should
abandon
them
the
swedish
council
of
war
which
the
king
now
assembled
strongly
urged
upon
him
all
these
considerations
in
order
to
deter
him
from
this
dangerous
undertaking
the
most
intrepid
were
appalled
and
a
troop
of
honourable
warriors
who
had
grown
gray
in
the
field
did
not
hesitate
to
express
their
alarm
but
the
king
resolution
was
fixed
what
said
he
to
gustavus
horn
who
spoke
for
the
rest
have
we
crossed
the
baltic
and
so
many
great
rivers
of
germany
and
shall
we
now
be
checked
by
a
brook
like
the
lech
gustavus
had
already
at
great
personal
risk
reconnoitred
the
whole
country
and
discovered
that
his
own
side
of
the
river
was
higher
than
the
other
and
consequently
gave
a
considerable
advantage
to
the
fire
of
the
swedish
artillery
over
that
of
the
enemy
with
great
presence
of
mind
he
determined
to
profit
by
this
circumstance
at
the
point
where
the
left
bank
of
the
lech
forms
an
angle
with
the
right
he
immediately
caused
three
batteries
to
be
erected
from
which
maintained
a
cross
fire
upon
the
enemy
while
this
tremendous
cannonade
drove
the
bavarians
from
the
opposite
bank
he
caused
to
be
erected
a
bridge
over
the
river
with
all
possible
rapidity
a
thick
smoke
kept
up
by
burning
wood
and
wet
straw
concealed
for
some
time
the
progress
of
the
work
from
the
enemy
while
the
continued
thunder
of
the
cannon
overpowered
the
noise
of
the
axes
he
kept
alive
by
his
own
example
the
courage
of
his
troops
and
discharged
more
than
cannon
with
his
own
hand
the
cannonade
was
returned
by
the
bavarians
with
equal
vivacity
for
two
hours
though
with
less
effect
as
the
swedish
batteries
swept
the
lower
opposite
bank
while
their
height
served
as
a
to
their
own
troops
in
vain
therefore
did
the
bavarians
attempt
to
destroy
these
works
the
superior
fire
of
the
swedes
threw
them
into

the
bridge
was
completed
under
their
very
eyes
on
this
dreadful
day
tilly
did
every
thing
in
his
power
to
encourage
his
troops
and
no
danger
could
drive
him
from
the
bank
at
length
he
found
the
death
which
he
sought
a
cannon
ball
shattered
his
leg
and
altringer
his
brave
was
soon
after
dangerously
wounded
in
the
head
deprived
of
the
animating
presence
of
their
two
generals
the
bavarians
gave
way
at
last
and
maximilian
in
spite
of
his
own
judgment
was
driven
to
adopt
a
pusillanimous
resolve
overcome
by
the
persuasions
of
the
dying
tilly
whose
wonted
firmness
was
overpowered
by
the
near
approach
of
death
he
gave
up
his
impregnable
position
for
lost
and
the
discovery
by
the
swedes
of
a
ford
by
which
their
cavalry
were
on
the
point
of
passing
accelerated
his
inglorious
retreat
the
same
night
before
a
single
soldier
of
the
enemy
had
crossed
the
lech
he
broke
up
his
camp
and
without
giving
time
for
the
king
to
harass
him
in
his
march
retreated
in
good
order
to
neuburgh
and
ingolstadt
with
astonishment
did
gustavus
adolphus
who
completed
the
passage
of
the
river
on
the
following
day
behold
the
hostile
camp
abandoned
and
the
elector
flight
surprised
him
still
more
when
he
saw
the
strength
of
the
position
he
had
quitted
had
i
been
the
bavarian
said
he
though
a
cannon
ball
had
carried
away
my
beard
and
chin
never
would
i
have
abandoned
a
position
like
this
and
laid
open
my
territory
to
my
enemies
bavaria
now
lay
exposed
to
the
conqueror
and
for
the
first
time
the
tide
of
war
which
had
hitherto
only
beat
against
its
frontier
now
flowed
over
its
long
spared
and
fertile
fields
before
however
the
king
proceeded
to
the
conquest
of
these
provinces
he
delivered
the
town
of
augsburg
from
the
yoke
of
bavaria
exacted
an
oath
of
allegiance
from
the
citizens
and
to
secure
its
observance
left
a
garrison
in
the
town
he
then
advanced
by
rapid
marches
against
ingolstadt
in
order
by
the
capture
of
this
important
fortress
which
the
elector
covered
with
the
greater
part
of
his
army
to
secure
his
conquests
in
bavaria
and
obtain
a
firm
footing
on
the
danube
shortly
after
the
appearance
of
the
swedish
king
before
ingolstadt
the
wounded
tilly
after
experiencing
the
caprice
of
unstable
fortune
terminated
his
career
within
the
walls
of
that
town
conquered
by
the
superior
generalship
of
gustavus
adolphus
he
lost
at
the
close
of
his
days
all
the
laurels
of
his
earlier
victories
and
appeased
by
a
series
of
misfortunes
the
demands
of
justice
and
the
avenging
manes
of
magdeburg
in
his
death
the
imperial
army
and
that
of
the
league
sustained
an
irreparable
loss
the
roman
catholic
religion
was
deprived
of
its
most
zealous
defender
and
maximilian
of
bavaria
of
the
most
faithful
of
his
servants
who
sealed
his
fidelity
by
his
death
and
even
in
his
dying
moments
fulfilled
the
duties
of
a
general
his
last
message
to
the
elector
was
an
urgent
advice
to
take
possession
of
ratisbon
in
order
to
maintain
the
command
of
the
danube
and
to
keep
open
the
communication
with
bohemia
with
the
confidence
which
was
the
natural
fruit
of
so
many
victories
gustavus
adolphus
commenced
the
siege
of
ingolstadt
hoping
to
gain
the
town
by
the
fury
of
his
first
assault
but
the
strength
of
its
fortifications
and
the
bravery
of
its
garrison
presented
obstacles
greater
than
any
he
had
had
to
encounter
since
the
battle
of
breitenfeld
and
the
walls
of
ingolstadt
were
near
putting
an
end
to
his
career
while
reconnoitring
the
works
a
killed
his
horse
under
him
and
he
fell
to
the
ground
while
almost
immediately
afterwards
another
ball
struck
his
favourite
the
young
margrave
of
baden
by
his
side
with
perfect
the
king
rose
and
quieted
the
fears
of
his
troops
by
immediately
mounting
another
horse
the
occupation
of
ratisbon
by
the
bavarians
who
by
the
advice
of
tilly
had
surprised
this
town
by
stratagem
and
placed
in
it
a
strong
garrison
quickly
changed
the
king
plan
of
operations
he
had
flattered
himself
with
the
hope
of
gaining
this
town
which
favoured
the
protestant
cause
and
to
find
in
it
an
ally
as
devoted
to
him
as
nuremberg
augsburg
and
frankfort
its
seizure
by
the
bavarians
seemed
to
postpone
for
a
long
time
the
fulfilment
of
his
favourite
project
of
making
himself
master
of
the
danube
and
cutting
off
his
adversaries
supplies
from
bohemia
he
suddenly
raised
the
siege
of
ingolstadt
before
which
he
had
wasted
both
his
time
and
his
troops
and
penetrated
into
the
interior
of
bavaria
in
order
to
draw
the
elector
into
that
quarter
for
the
defence
of
his
territories
and
thus
to
strip
the
danube
of
its
defenders
the
whole
country
as
far
as
munich
now
lay
open
to
the
conqueror
mosburg
landshut
and
the
whole
territory
of
freysingen
submitted
nothing
could
resist
his
arms
but
if
he
met
with
no
regular
force
to
oppose
his
progress
he
had
to
contend
against
a
still
more
implacable
enemy
in
the
heart
of
every
bavarian
religious
fanaticism
soldiers
who
did
not
believe
in
the
pope
were
in
this
country
a
new
and
phenomenon
the
blind
zeal
of
the
priests
represented
them
to
the
peasantry
as
monsters
the
children
of
hell
and
their
leader
as
antichrist
no
wonder
then
if
they
thought
themselves
released
from
all
the
ties
of
nature
and
humanity
towards
this
brood
of
satan
and
justified
in
committing
the
most
savage
atrocities
upon
them
woe
to
the
swedish
soldier
who
fell
into
their
hands
all
the
torments
which
inventive
malice
could
devise
were
exercised
upon
these
unhappy
victims
and
the
sight
of
their
mangled
bodies
exasperated
the
army
to
a
fearful
retaliation
gustavus
adolphus
alone
sullied
the
lustre
of
his
heroic
character
by
no
act
of
revenge
and
the
aversion
which
the
bavarians
felt
towards
his
religion
far
from
making
him
depart
from
the
obligations
of
humanity
towards
that
unfortunate
people
seemed
to
impose
upon
him
the
stricter
duty
to
honour
his
religion
by
a
more
constant
clemency
the
approach
of
the
king
spread
terror
and
consternation
in
the
capital
which
stripped
of
its
defenders
and
abandoned
by
its
principal
inhabitants
placed
all
its
hopes
in
the
magnanimity
of
the
conqueror
by
an
unconditional
and
voluntary
surrender
it
hoped
to
disarm
his
vengeance
and
sent
deputies
even
to
freysingen
to
lay
at
his
feet
the
keys
of
the
city
strongly
as
the
king
might
have
been
tempted
by
the
inhumanity
of
the
bavarians
and
the
hostility
of
their
sovereign
to
make
a
dreadful
use
of
the
rights
of
victory
pressed
as
he
was
by
germans
to
avenge
the
fate
of
magdeburg
on
the
capital
of
its
destroyer
this
great
prince
scorned
this
mean
revenge
and
the
very
helplessness
of
his
enemies
disarmed
his
severity
contented
with
the
more
noble
triumph
of
conducting
the
palatine
frederick
with
the
pomp
of
a
victor
into
the
very
palace
of
the
prince
who
had
been
the
chief
instrument
of
his
ruin
and
the
usurper
of
his
territories
he
heightened
the
brilliancy
of
his
triumphal
entry
by
the
brighter
splendour
of
moderation
and
clemency
the
king
found
in
munich
only
a
forsaken
palace
for
the
elector
treasures
had
been
transported
to
werfen
the
magnificence
of
the
building
astonished
him
and
he
asked
the
guide
who
showed
the
apartments
who
was
the
architect
no
other
replied
he
than
the
elector
himself
i
wish
said
the
king
i
had
this
architect
to
send
to
stockholm
that
he
was
answered
the
architect
will
take
care
to
prevent
when
the
arsenal
was
examined
they
found
nothing
but
carriages
stripped
of
their
cannon
the
latter
had
been
so
artfully
concealed
under
the
floor
that
no
traces
of
them
remained
and
but
for
the
treachery
of
a
workman
the
deceit
would
not
have
been
detected
rise
up
from
the
dead
said
the
king
and
come
to
judgment
the
floor
was
pulled
up
and
pieces
of
cannon
discovered
some
of
extraordinary
calibre
which
had
been
principally
taken
in
the
palatinate
and
bohemia
a
treasure
of
gold
ducats
concealed
in
one
of
the
largest
completed
the
pleasure
which
the
king
received
from
this
valuable
acquisition
a
far
more
welcome
spectacle
still
would
have
been
the
bavarian
army
itself
for
his
march
into
the
heart
of
bavaria
had
been
undertaken
chiefly
with
the
view
of
luring
them
from
their
entrenchments
in
this
expectation
he
was
disappointed
no
enemy
appeared
no
entreaties
however
urgent
on
the
part
of
his
subjects
could
induce
the
elector
to
risk
the
remainder
of
his
army
to
the
chances
of
a
battle
shut
up
in
ratisbon
he
awaited
the
reinforcements
which
wallenstein
was
bringing
from
bohemia
and
endeavoured
in
the
mean
time
to
amuse
his
enemy
and
keep
him
inactive
by
reviving
the
negociation
for
a
neutrality
but
the
king
distrust
too
often
and
too
justly
excited
by
his
previous
conduct
frustrated
this
design
and
the
intentional
delay
of
wallenstein
abandoned
bavaria
to
the
swedes
thus
far
had
gustavus
advanced
from
victory
to
victory
without
meeting
with
an
enemy
able
to
cope
with
him
a
part
of
bavaria
and
swabia
the
bishoprics
of
franconia
the
lower
palatinate
and
the
archbishopric
of
mentz
lay
conquered
in
his
rear
an
uninterrupted
career
of
conquest
had
conducted
him
to
the
threshold
of
austria
and
the
most
brilliant
success
had
fully
justified
the
plan
of
operations
which
he
had
formed
after
the
battle
of
breitenfeld
if
he
had
not
succeeded
to
his
wish
in
promoting
a
confederacy
among
the
protestant
states
he
had
at
least
disarmed
or
weakened
the
league
carried
on
the
war
chiefly
at
its
expense
lessened
the
emperor
resources
emboldened
the
weaker
states
and
while
he
laid
under
contribution
the
allies
of
the
emperor
forced
a
way
through
their
territories
into
austria
itself
where
arms
were
unavailing
the
greatest
service
was
rendered
by
the
friendship
of
the
free
cities
whose
affections
he
had
gained
by
the
double
ties
of
policy
and
religion
and
as
long
as
he
should
maintain
his
superiority
in
the
field
he
might
reckon
on
every
thing
from
their
zeal
by
his
conquests
on
the
rhine
the
spaniards
were
cut
off
from
the
lower
palatinate
even
if
the
state
of
the
war
in
the
netherlands
left
them
at
liberty
to
interfere
in
the
affairs
of
germany
the
duke
of
lorraine
too
after
his
unfortunate
campaign
had
been
glad
to
adopt
a
neutrality
even
the
numerous
garrisons
he
had
left
behind
him
in
his
progress
through
germany
had
not
diminished
his
army
and
fresh
and
vigorous
as
when
he
first
began
his
march
he
now
stood
in
the
centre
of
bavaria
determined
and
prepared
to
carry
the
war
into
the
heart
of
austria
while
gustavus
adolphus
thus
maintained
his
superiority
within
the
empire
fortune
in
another
quarter
had
been
no
less
favourable
to
his
ally
the
elector
of
saxony
by
the
arrangement
concerted
between
these
princes
at
halle
after
the
battle
of
leipzig
the
conquest
of
bohemia
was
intrusted
to
the
elector
of
saxony
while
the
king
reserved
for
himself
the
attack
upon
the
territories
of
the
league
the
first
fruits
which
the
elector
reaped
from
the
battle
of
breitenfeld
was
the
reconquest
of
leipzig
which
was
shortly
followed
by
the
expulsion
of
the
austrian
garrisons
from
the
entire
circle
reinforced
by
the
troops
who
deserted
to
him
from
the
hostile
garrisons
the
saxon
general
arnheim
marched
towards
lusatia
which
had
been
overrun
by
an
imperial
general
rudolph
von
tiefenbach
in
order
to
chastise
the
elector
for
embracing
the
cause
of
the
enemy
he
had
already
commenced
in
this
weakly
defended
province
the
usual
course
of
devastation
taken
several
towns
and
terrified
dresden
itself
by
his
approach
when
his
destructive
progress
was
suddenly
stopped
by
an
express
mandate
from
the
emperor
to
spare
the
possessions
of
the
king
of
saxony
ferdinand
had
perceived
too
late
the
errors
of
that
policy
which
reduced
the
elector
of
saxony
to
extremities
and
forcibly
driven
this
powerful
monarch
into
an
alliance
with
sweden
by
moderation
equally
he
now
wished
to
repair
if
possible
the
consequences
of
his
haughtiness
and
thus
committed
a
second
error
in
endeavouring
to
repair
the
first
to
deprive
his
enemy
of
so
powerful
an
ally
he
had
opened
through
the
intervention
of
spain
a
negociation
with
the
elector
and
in
order
to
facilitate
an
accommodation
tiefenbach
was
ordered
immediately
to
retire
from
saxony
but
these
concessions
of
the
emperor
far
from
producing
the
desired
effect
only
revealed
to
the
elector
the
embarrassment
of
his
adversary
and
his
own
importance
and
emboldened
him
the
more
to
prosecute
the
advantages
he
had
already
obtained
how
could
he
moreover
without
becoming
chargeable
with
the
most
shameful
ingratitude
abandon
an
ally
to
whom
he
had
given
the
most
solemn
assurances
of
fidelity
and
to
whom
he
was
indebted
for
the
preservation
of
his
dominions
and
even
of
his
electoral
dignity
the
saxon
army
now
relieved
from
the
necessity
of
marching
into
lusatia
advanced
towards
bohemia
where
a
combination
of
favourable
circumstances
seemed
to
ensure
them
an
easy
victory
in
this
kingdom
the
first
scene
of
this
fatal
war
the
flames
of
dissension
still
smouldered
beneath
the
ashes
while
the
discontent
of
the
inhabitants
was
fomented
by
daily
acts
of
oppression
and
tyranny
on
every
side
this
unfortunate
country
showed
signs
of
a
mournful
change
whole
districts
had
changed
their
proprietors
and
groaned
under
the
hated
yoke
of
roman
catholic
masters
whom
the
favour
of
the
emperor
and
the
jesuits
had
enriched
with
the
plunder
and
possessions
of
the
exiled
protestants
others
taking
advantage
themselves
of
the
general
distress
had
purchased
at
a
low
rate
the
confiscated
estates
the
blood
of
the
most
eminent
champions
of
liberty
had
been
shed
upon
the
scaffold
and
such
as
by
a
timely
flight
avoided
that
fate
were
wandering
in
misery
far
from
their
native
land
while
the
obsequious
slaves
of
despotism
enjoyed
their
patrimony
still
more
insupportable
than
the
oppression
of
these
petty
tyrants
was
the
restraint
of
conscience
which
was
imposed
without
distinction
on
all
the
protestants
of
that
kingdom
no
external
danger
no
opposition
on
the
part
of
the
nation
however
steadfast
not
even
the
fearful
lessons
of
past
experience
could
check
in
the
jesuits
the
rage
of
proselytism
where
fair
means
were
ineffectual
recourse
was
had
to
military
force
to
bring
the
deluded
wanderers
within
the
pale
of
the
church
the
inhabitants
of
joachimsthal
on
the
frontiers
between
bohemia
and
meissen
were
the
chief
sufferers
from
this
violence
two
imperial
commissaries
accompanied
by
as
many
jesuits
and
supported
by
fifteen
musketeers
made
their
appearance
in
this
peaceful
valley
to
preach
the
gospel
to
the
heretics
where
the
rhetoric
of
the
former
was
ineffectual
the
forcibly
quartering
the
latter
upon
the
houses
and
threats
of
banishment
and
fines
were
tried
but
on
this
occasion
the
good
cause
prevailed
and
the
bold
resistance
of
this
small
district
compelled
the
emperor
disgracefully
to
recall
his
mandate
of
conversion
the
example
of
the
court
had
however
afforded
a
precedent
to
the
roman
catholics
of
the
empire
and
seemed
to
justify
every
act
of
oppression
which
their
insolence
tempted
them
to
wreak
upon
the
protestants
it
is
not
surprising
then
if
this
persecuted
party
was
favourable
to
a
revolution
and
saw
with
pleasure
their
deliverers
on
the
frontiers
the
saxon
army
was
already
on
its
march
towards
prague
the
imperial
garrisons
everywhere
retired
before
them
schloeckenau
tetschen
aussig
leutmeritz
soon
fell
into
the
enemy
hands
and
every
roman
catholic
place
was
abandoned
to
plunder
consternation
seized
all
the
papists
of
the
empire
and
conscious
of
the
outrages
which
they
themselves
had
committed
on
the
protestants
they
did
not
venture
to
abide
the
vengeful
arrival
of
a
protestant
army
all
the
roman
catholics
who
had
anything
to
lose
fled
hastily
from
the
country
to
the
capital
which
again
they
presently
abandoned
prague
was
unprepared
for
an
attack
and
was
too
weakly
garrisoned
to
sustain
a
long
siege
too
late
had
the
emperor
resolved
to
despatch
tiefenbach
to
the
defence
of
this
capital
before
the
imperial
orders
could
reach
the
of
that
general
in
silesia
the
saxons
were
already
close
to
prague
the
protestant
inhabitants
of
which
showed
little
zeal
while
the
weakness
of
the
garrison
left
no
room
to
hope
a
long
resistance
in
this
fearful
state
of
embarrassment
the
roman
catholics
of
prague
looked
for
security
to
wallenstein
who
now
lived
in
that
city
as
a
private
individual
but
far
from
lending
his
military
experience
and
the
weight
of
his
name
towards
its
defence
he
seized
the
favourable
opportunity
to
satiate
his
thirst
for
revenge
if
he
did
not
actually
invite
the
saxons
to
prague
at
least
his
conduct
facilitated
its
capture
though
unprepared
the
town
might
still
hold
out
until
succours
could
arrive
and
an
imperial
colonel
count
maradas
showed
serious
intentions
of
undertaking
its
defence
but
without
command
and
authority
and
having
no
support
but
his
own
zeal
and
courage
he
did
not
dare
to
venture
upon
such
a
step
without
the
advice
of
a
superior
he
therefore
consulted
the
duke
of
friedland
whose
approbation
might
supply
the
want
of
authority
from
the
emperor
and
to
whom
the
bohemian
generals
were
referred
by
an
express
edict
of
the
court
in
the
last
extremity
he
however
artfully
excused
himself
on
the
plea
of
holding
no
official
appointment
and
his
long
retirement
from
the
political
world
while
he
weakened
the
resolution
of
the
subalterns
by
the
scruples
which
he
suggested
and
painted
in
the
strongest
colours
at
last
to
render
the
consternation
general
and
complete
he
quitted
the
capital
with
his
whole
court
however
little
he
had
to
fear
from
its
capture
and
the
city
was
lost
because
by
his
departure
he
showed
that
he
despaired
of
its
safety
his
example
was
followed
by
all
the
roman
catholic
nobility
the
generals
with
their
troops
the
clergy
and
all
the
officers
of
the
crown
all
night
the
people
were
employed
in
saving
their
persons
and
effects
the
roads
to
vienna
were
crowded
with
fugitives
who
scarcely
recovered
from
their
consternation
till
they
reached
the
imperial
city
maradas
himself
despairing
of
the
safety
of
prague
followed
the
rest
and
led
his
small
detachment
to
tabor
where
he
awaited
the
event
profound
silence
reigned
in
prague
when
the
saxons
next
morning
appeared
before
it
no
preparations
were
made
for
defence
not
a
single
shot
from
the
walls
announced
an
intention
of
resistance
on
the
contrary
a
crowd
of
spectators
from
the
town
allured
by
curiosity
came
flocking
round
to
behold
the
foreign
army
and
the
peaceful
confidence
with
which
they
advanced
resembled
a
friendly
salutation
more
than
a
hostile
reception
from
the
concurrent
reports
of
these
people
the
saxons
learned
that
the
town
had
been
deserted
by
the
troops
and
that
the
government
had
fled
to
budweiss
this
unexpected
and
inexplicable
absence
of
resistance
excited
arnheim
distrust
the
more
as
the
speedy
approach
of
the
silesian
succours
was
no
secret
to
him
and
as
he
knew
that
the
saxon
army
was
too
indifferently
provided
with
materials
for
undertaking
a
siege
and
by
far
too
weak
in
numbers
to
attempt
to
take
the
place
by
storm
apprehensive
of
stratagem
he
redoubled
his
vigilance
and
he
continued
in
this
conviction
until
wallenstein
whom
he
discovered
among
the
crowd
confirmed
to
him
this
intelligence
the
town
is
ours
without
a
blow
exclaimed
he
in
astonishment
to
his
officers
and
immediately
summoned
it
by
a
trumpeter
the
citizens
of
prague
thus
shamefully
abandoned
by
their
defenders
had
long
taken
their
resolution
all
that
they
had
to
do
was
to
secure
their
properties
and
liberties
by
an
advantageous
capitulation
no
sooner
was
the
treaty
signed
by
the
saxon
general
in
his
master
name
than
the
gates
were
opened
without
farther
opposition
and
upon
the
of
november
the
army
made
their
triumphal
entry
the
elector
soon
after
followed
in
person
to
receive
the
homage
of
those
whom
he
had
newly
taken
under
his
protection
for
it
was
only
in
the
character
of
protector
that
the
three
towns
of
prague
had
surrendered
to
him
their
allegiance
to
the
austrian
monarchy
was
not
to
be
dissolved
by
the
step
they
had
taken
in
proportion
as
the
papists
apprehensions
of
reprisals
on
the
part
of
the
protestants
had
been
exaggerated
so
was
their
surprise
great
at
the
moderation
of
the
elector
and
the
discipline
of
his
troops
arnheim
plainly
evinced
on
this
occasion
his
respect
for
wallenstein
not
content
with
sparing
his
estates
on
his
march
he
now
placed
guards
over
his
palace
in
prague
to
prevent
the
plunder
of
any
of
his
effects
the
roman
catholics
of
the
town
were
allowed
the
fullest
liberty
of
conscience
and
of
all
the
churches
they
had
wrested
from
the
protestants
four
only
were
now
taken
back
from
them
from
this
general
indulgence
none
were
excluded
but
the
jesuits
who
were
generally
considered
as
the
authors
of
all
past
grievances
and
thus
banished
the
kingdom
john
george
belied
not
the
submission
and
dependence
with
which
the
terror
of
the
imperial
name
inspired
him
nor
did
he
indulge
at
prague
in
a
course
of
conduct
which
would
assuredly
have
been
pursued
against
himself
in
dresden
by
imperial
generals
such
as
tilly
or
wallenstein
he
carefully
distinguished
between
the
enemy
with
whom
he
was
at
war
and
the
head
of
the
empire
to
whom
he
owed
obedience
he
did
not
venture
to
touch
the
household
furniture
of
the
latter
while
without
scruple
he
appropriated
and
transported
to
dresden
the
cannon
of
the
former
he
did
not
take
up
his
residence
in
the
imperial
palace
but
the
house
of
lichtenstein
too
modest
to
use
the
apartments
of
one
whom
he
had
deprived
of
a
kingdom
had
this
trait
been
related
of
a
great
man
and
a
hero
it
would
irresistibly
excite
our
admiration
but
the
character
of
this
prince
leaves
us
in
doubt
whether
this
moderation
ought
to
be
ascribed
to
a
noble
or
to
the
littleness
of
a
weak
mind
which
even
good
fortune
could
not
embolden
and
liberty
itself
could
not
strip
of
its
habituated
fetters
the
surrender
of
prague
which
was
quickly
followed
by
that
of
most
of
the
other
towns
effected
a
great
and
sudden
change
in
bohemia
many
of
the
protestant
nobility
who
had
hitherto
been
wandering
about
in
misery
now
returned
to
their
native
country
and
count
thurn
the
famous
author
of
the
bohemian
insurrection
enjoyed
the
triumph
of
returning
as
a
conqueror
to
the
scene
of
his
crime
and
his
condemnation
over
the
very
bridge
where
the
heads
of
his
adherents
exposed
to
view
held
out
a
fearful
picture
of
the
fate
which
had
threatened
himself
he
now
made
his
triumphal
entry
and
to
remove
these
ghastly
objects
was
his
first
care
the
exiles
again
took
possession
of
their
properties
without
thinking
of
recompensing
for
the
purchase
money
the
present
possessors
who
had
mostly
taken
to
flight
even
though
they
had
received
a
price
for
their
estates
they
seized
on
every
thing
which
had
once
been
their
own
and
many
had
reason
to
rejoice
at
the
economy
of
the
late
possessors
the
lands
and
cattle
had
greatly
improved
in
their
hands
the
apartments
were
now
decorated
with
the
most
costly
furniture
the
cellars
which
had
been
left
empty
were
richly
filled
the
stables
supplied
the
magazines
stored
with
provisions
but
distrusting
the
constancy
of
that
good
fortune
which
had
so
unexpectedly
smiled
upon
them
they
hastened
to
get
quit
of
these
insecure
possessions
and
to
convert
their
immoveable
into
transferable
property
the
presence
of
the
saxons
inspired
all
the
protestants
of
the
kingdom
with
courage
and
both
in
the
country
and
the
capital
crowds
flocked
to
the
newly
opened
protestant
churches
many
whom
fear
alone
had
retained
in
their
adherence
to
popery
now
openly
professed
the
new
doctrine
and
many
of
the
late
converts
to
roman
catholicism
gladly
renounced
a
compulsory
persuasion
to
follow
the
earlier
conviction
of
their
conscience
all
the
moderation
of
the
new
regency
could
not
restrain
the
manifestation
of
that
just
displeasure
which
this
persecuted
people
felt
against
their
oppressors
they
made
a
fearful
and
cruel
use
of
their
newly
recovered
rights
and
in
many
parts
of
the
kingdom
their
hatred
of
the
religion
which
they
had
been
compelled
to
profess
could
be
satiated
only
by
the
blood
of
its
adherents
meantime
the
succours
which
the
imperial
generals
goetz
and
tiefenbach
were
conducting
from
silesia
had
entered
bohemia
where
they
were
joined
by
some
of
tilly
regiments
from
the
upper
palatinate
in
order
to
disperse
them
before
they
should
receive
any
further
reinforcement
arnheim
advanced
with
part
of
his
army
from
prague
and
made
a
vigorous
attack
on
their
entrenchments
near
limburg
on
the
elbe
after
a
severe
action
not
without
great
loss
he
drove
the
enemy
from
their
fortified
camp
and
forced
them
by
his
heavy
fire
to
recross
the
elbe
and
to
destroy
the
bridge
which
they
had
built
over
that
river
nevertheless
the
imperialists
obtained
the
advantage
in
several
skirmishes
and
the
croats
pushed
their
incursions
to
the
very
gates
of
prague
brilliant
and
promising
as
the
opening
of
the
bohemian
campaign
had
been
the
issue
by
no
means
satisfied
the
expectations
of
gustavus
adolphus
instead
of
vigorously
following
up
their
advantages
by
forcing
a
passage
to
the
swedish
army
through
the
conquered
country
and
then
with
it
attacking
the
imperial
power
in
its
centre
the
saxons
weakened
themselves
in
a
war
of
skirmishes
in
which
they
were
not
always
successful
while
they
lost
the
time
which
should
have
been
devoted
to
greater
undertakings
but
the
elector
subsequent
conduct
betrayed
the
motives
which
had
prevented
him
from
pushing
his
advantage
over
the
emperor
and
by
consistent
measures
promoting
the
plans
of
the
king
of
sweden
the
emperor
had
now
lost
the
greater
part
of
bohemia
and
the
saxons
were
advancing
against
austria
while
the
swedish
monarch
was
rapidly
moving
to
the
same
point
through
franconia
swabia
and
bavaria
a
long
war
had
exhausted
the
strength
of
the
austrian
monarchy
wasted
the
country
and
diminished
its
armies
the
renown
of
its
victories
was
no
more
as
well
as
the
confidence
inspired
by
constant
success
its
troops
had
lost
the
obedience
and
discipline
to
which
those
of
the
swedish
monarch
owed
all
their
superiority
in
the
field
the
confederates
of
the
emperor
were
disarmed
or
their
fidelity
shaken
by
the
danger
which
threatened
themselves
even
maximilian
of
bavaria
austria
most
powerful
ally
seemed
disposed
to
yield
to
the
seductive
proposition
of
neutrality
while
his
suspicious
alliance
with
france
had
long
been
a
subject
of
apprehension
to
the
emperor
the
bishops
of
wurtzburg
and
bamberg
the
elector
of
mentz
and
the
duke
of
lorraine
were
either
expelled
from
their
territories
or
threatened
with
immediate
attack
treves
had
placed
itself
under
the
protection
of
france
the
bravery
of
the
hollanders
gave
full
employment
to
the
spanish
arms
in
the
netherlands
while
gustavus
had
driven
them
from
the
rhine
poland
was
still
fettered
by
the
truce
which
subsisted
between
that
country
and
sweden
the
hungarian
frontier
was
threatened
by
the
transylvanian
prince
ragotsky
a
successor
of
bethlen
gabor
and
the
inheritor
of
his
restless
mind
while
the
porte
was
making
great
preparation
to
profit
by
the
favourable
conjuncture
for
aggression
most
of
the
protestant
states
encouraged
by
their
protector
success
were
openly
and
actively
declaring
against
the
emperor
all
the
resources
which
had
been
obtained
by
the
violent
and
oppressive
extortions
of
tilly
and
wallenstein
were
exhausted
all
these
depots
magazines
and
were
now
lost
to
the
emperor
and
the
war
could
no
longer
be
carried
on
as
before
at
the
cost
of
others
to
complete
his
embarrassment
a
dangerous
insurrection
broke
out
in
the
territory
of
the
ens
where
the
religious
zeal
of
the
government
had
provoked
the
protestants
to
resistance
and
thus
fanaticism
lit
its
torch
within
the
empire
while
a
foreign
enemy
was
already
on
its
frontier
after
so
long
a
continuance
of
good
fortune
such
brilliant
victories
and
extensive
conquests
such
fruitless
effusion
of
blood
the
emperor
saw
himself
a
second
time
on
the
brink
of
that
abyss
into
which
he
was
so
near
falling
at
the
commencement
of
his
reign
if
bavaria
should
embrace
the
neutrality
if
saxony
should
resist
the
tempting
offers
he
had
held
out
and
france
resolve
to
attack
the
spanish
power
at
the
same
time
in
the
netherlands
in
italy
and
in
catalonia
the
ruin
of
austria
would
be
complete
the
allied
powers
would
divide
its
spoils
and
the
political
system
of
germany
would
undergo
a
total
change
the
chain
of
these
disasters
began
with
the
battle
of
breitenfeld
the
unfortunate
issue
of
which
plainly
revealed
the
long
decided
decline
of
the
austrian
power
whose
weakness
had
hitherto
been
concealed
under
the
dazzling
glitter
of
a
grand
name
the
chief
cause
of
the
swedes
superiority
in
the
field
was
evidently
to
be
ascribed
to
the
unlimited
power
of
their
leader
who
concentrated
in
himself
the
whole
strength
of
his
party
and
unfettered
in
his
enterprises
by
any
higher
authority
was
complete
master
of
every
favourable
opportunity
could
control
all
his
means
to
the
accomplishment
of
his
ends
and
was
responsible
to
none
but
himself
but
since
wallenstein
dismissal
and
tilly
defeat
the
very
reverse
of
this
course
was
pursued
by
the
emperor
and
the
league
the
generals
wanted
authority
over
their
troops
and
liberty
of
acting
at
their
discretion
the
soldiers
were
deficient
in
discipline
and
obedience
the
scattered
corps
in
combined
operation
the
states
in
attachment
to
the
cause
the
leaders
in
harmony
among
themselves
in
quickness
to
resolve
and
firmness
to
execute
what
gave
the
emperor
enemy
so
decided
an
advantage
over
him
was
not
so
much
their
superior
power
as
their
manner
of
using
it
the
league
and
the
emperor
did
not
want
means
but
a
mind
capable
of
directing
them
with
energy
and
effect
even
had
count
tilly
not
lost
his
old
renown
distrust
of
bavaria
would
not
allow
the
emperor
to
place
the
fate
of
austria
in
the
hands
of
one
who
had
never
concealed
his
attachment
to
the
bavarian
elector
the
urgent
want
which
ferdinand
felt
was
for
a
general
possessed
of
sufficient
experience
to
form
and
to
command
an
army
and
willing
at
the
same
time
to
dedicate
his
services
with
blind
devotion
to
the
austrian
monarchy
this
choice
now
occupied
the
attention
of
the
emperor
privy
council
and
divided
the
opinions
of
its
members
in
order
to
oppose
one
monarch
to
another
and
by
the
presence
of
their
sovereign
to
animate
the
courage
of
the
troops
ferdinand
in
the
ardour
of
the
moment
had
offered
himself
to
be
the
leader
of
his
army
but
little
trouble
was
required
to
overturn
a
resolution
which
was
the
offspring
of
despair
alone
and
which
yielded
at
once
to
calm
reflection
but
the
situation
which
his
dignity
and
the
duties
of
administration
prevented
the
emperor
from
holding
might
be
filled
by
his
son
a
youth
of
talents
and
bravery
and
of
whom
the
subjects
of
austria
had
already
formed
great
expectations
called
by
his
birth
to
the
defence
of
a
monarchy
of
whose
crowns
he
wore
two
already
ferdinand
king
of
hungary
and
bohemia
united
with
the
natural
dignity
of
heir
to
the
throne
the
respect
of
the
army
and
the
attachment
of
the
people
whose
was
indispensable
to
him
in
the
conduct
of
the
war
none
but
the
beloved
heir
to
the
crown
could
venture
to
impose
new
burdens
on
a
people
already
severely
oppressed
his
personal
presence
with
the
army
could
alone
suppress
the
pernicious
jealousies
of
the
several
leaders
and
by
the
influence
of
his
name
restore
the
neglected
discipline
of
the
troops
to
its
former
rigour
if
so
young
a
leader
was
devoid
of
the
maturity
of
judgment
prudence
and
military
experience
which
practice
alone
could
impart
this
deficiency
might
be
supplied
by
a
judicious
choice
of
counsellors
and
assistants
who
under
the
cover
of
his
name
might
be
vested
with
supreme
authority
but
plausible
as
were
the
arguments
with
which
a
part
of
the
ministry
supported
this
plan
it
was
met
by
difficulties
not
less
serious
arising
from
the
distrust
perhaps
even
the
jealousy
of
the
emperor
and
also
from
the
desperate
state
of
affairs
how
dangerous
was
it
to
entrust
the
fate
of
the
monarchy
to
a
youth
who
was
himself
in
need
of
counsel
and
support
how
hazardous
to
oppose
to
the
greatest
general
of
his
age
a
tyro
whose
fitness
for
so
important
a
post
had
never
yet
been
tested
by
experience
whose
name
as
yet
unknown
to
fame
was
far
too
powerless
to
inspire
a
dispirited
army
with
the
assurance
of
future
victory
what
a
new
burden
on
the
country
to
support
the
state
a
royal
leader
was
required
to
maintain
and
which
the
prejudices
of
the
age
considered
as
inseparable
from
his
presence
with
the
army
how
serious
a
consideration
for
the
prince
himself
to
commence
his
political
career
with
an
office
which
must
make
him
the
scourge
of
his
people
and
the
oppressor
of
the
territories
which
he
was
hereafter
to
rule
but
not
only
was
a
general
to
be
found
for
the
army
an
army
must
also
be
found
for
the
general
since
the
compulsory
resignation
of
wallenstein
the
emperor
had
defended
himself
more
by
the
assistance
of
bavaria
and
the
league
than
by
his
own
armies
and
it
was
this
dependence
on
equivocal
allies
which
he
was
endeavouring
to
escape
by
the
appointment
of
a
general
of
his
own
but
what
possibility
was
there
of
raising
an
army
out
of
nothing
without
the
aid
of
gold
and
the
inspiriting
name
of
a
victorious
commander
above
all
an
army
which
by
its
discipline
warlike
spirit
and
activity
should
be
fit
to
cope
with
the
experienced
troops
of
the
northern
conqueror
in
all
europe
there
was
but
one
man
equal
to
this
and
that
one
had
been
mortally
affronted
the
moment
had
at
last
arrived
when
more
than
ordinary
satisfaction
was
to
be
done
to
the
wounded
pride
of
the
duke
of
friedland
fate
itself
had
been
his
avenger
and
an
unbroken
chain
of
disasters
which
had
assailed
austria
from
the
day
of
his
dismissal
had
wrung
from
the
emperor
the
humiliating
confession
that
with
this
general
he
had
lost
his
right
arm
every
defeat
of
his
troops
opened
afresh
this
wound
every
town
which
he
lost
revived
in
the
mind
of
the
deceived
monarch
the
memory
of
his
own
weakness
and
ingratitude
it
would
have
been
well
for
him
if
in
the
offended
general
he
had
only
lost
a
leader
of
his
troops
and
a
defender
of
his
dominions
but
he
was
destined
to
find
in
him
an
enemy
and
the
most
dangerous
of
all
since
he
was
least
armed
against
the
stroke
of
treason
removed
from
the
theatre
of
war
and
condemned
to
irksome
inaction
while
his
rivals
gathered
laurels
on
the
field
of
glory
the
haughty
duke
had
beheld
these
changes
of
fortune
with
affected
composure
and
concealed
under
a
glittering
and
theatrical
pomp
the
dark
designs
of
his
restless
genius
torn
by
burning
passions
within
while
all
without
bespoke
calmness
and
indifference
he
brooded
over
projects
of
ambition
and
revenge
and
slowly
but
surely
advanced
towards
his
end
all
that
he
owed
to
the
emperor
was
effaced
from
his
mind
what
he
himself
had
done
for
the
emperor
was
imprinted
in
burning
characters
on
his
memory
to
his
insatiable
thirst
for
power
the
emperor
ingratitude
was
welcome
as
it
seemed
to
tear
in
pieces
the
record
of
past
favours
to
absolve
him
from
every
obligation
towards
his
former
benefactor
in
the
disguise
of
a
righteous
retaliation
the
projects
dictated
by
his
ambition
now
appeared
to
him
just
and
pure
in
proportion
as
the
external
circle
of
his
operations
was
narrowed
the
world
of
hope
expanded
before
him
and
his
dreamy
imagination
revelled
in
boundless
projects
which
in
any
mind
but
such
as
his
madness
alone
could
have
given
birth
to
his
services
had
raised
him
to
the
proudest
height
which
it
was
possible
for
a
man
by
his
own
efforts
to
attain
fortune
had
denied
him
nothing
which
the
subject
and
the
citizen
could
lawfully
enjoy
till
the
moment
of
his
dismissal
his
demands
had
met
with
no
refusal
his
ambition
had
met
with
no
check
but
the
blow
which
at
the
diet
of
ratisbon
humbled
him
showed
him
the
difference
between
original
and
deputed
power
the
distance
between
the
subject
and
his
sovereign
roused
from
the
intoxication
of
his
own
greatness
by
this
sudden
reverse
of
fortune
he
compared
the
authority
which
he
had
possessed
with
that
which
had
deprived
him
of
it
and
his
ambition
marked
the
steps
which
it
had
yet
to
surmount
upon
the
ladder
of
fortune
from
the
moment
he
had
so
bitterly
experienced
the
weight
of
sovereign
power
his
efforts
were
directed
to
attain
it
for
himself
the
wrong
which
he
himself
had
suffered
made
him
a
robber
had
he
not
been
outraged
by
injustice
he
might
have
obediently
moved
in
his
orbit
round
the
majesty
of
the
throne
satisfied
with
the
glory
of
being
the
brightest
of
its
satellites
it
was
only
when
violently
forced
from
its
sphere
that
his
wandering
star
threw
in
disorder
the
system
to
which
it
belonged
and
came
in
destructive
collision
with
its
sun
gustavus
adolphus
had
overrun
the
north
of
germany
one
place
after
another
was
lost
and
at
leipzig
the
flower
of
the
austrian
army
had
fallen
the
intelligence
of
this
defeat
soon
reached
the
ears
of
wallenstein
who
in
the
retired
obscurity
of
a
private
station
in
prague
contemplated
from
a
calm
distance
the
tumult
of
war
the
news
which
filled
the
breasts
of
the
roman
catholics
with
dismay
announced
to
him
the
return
of
greatness
and
good
fortune
for
him
was
gustavus
adolphus
labouring
scarce
had
the
king
begun
to
gain
reputation
by
his
exploits
when
wallenstein
lost
not
a
moment
to
court
his
friendship
and
to
make
common
cause
with
this
successful
enemy
of
austria
the
banished
count
thurn
who
had
long
entered
the
service
of
sweden
undertook
to
convey
wallenstein
congratulations
to
the
king
and
to
invite
him
to
a
close
alliance
with
the
duke
wallenstein
required
men
from
the
king
and
with
these
and
the
troops
he
himself
engaged
to
raise
he
undertook
to
conquer
bohemia
and
moravia
to
surprise
vienna
and
drive
his
master
the
emperor
before
him
into
italy
welcome
as
was
this
unexpected
proposition
its
extravagant
promises
were
naturally
calculated
to
excite
suspicion
gustavus
adolphus
was
too
good
a
judge
of
merit
to
reject
with
coldness
the
offers
of
one
who
might
be
so
important
a
friend
but
when
wallenstein
encouraged
by
the
favourable
reception
of
his
first
message
renewed
it
after
the
battle
of
breitenfeld
and
pressed
for
a
decisive
answer
the
prudent
monarch
hesitated
to
trust
his
reputation
to
the
chimerical
projects
of
so
daring
an
adventurer
and
to
commit
so
large
a
force
to
the
honesty
of
a
man
who
felt
no
shame
in
openly
avowing
himself
a
traitor
he
excused
himself
therefore
on
the
plea
of
the
weakness
of
his
army
which
if
diminished
by
so
large
a
detachment
would
certainly
suffer
in
its
march
through
the
empire
and
thus
perhaps
by
excess
of
caution
lost
an
opportunity
of
putting
an
immediate
end
to
the
war
he
afterwards
endeavoured
to
renew
the
negociation
but
the
favourable
moment
was
past
and
wallenstein
offended
pride
never
forgave
the
first
neglect
but
the
king
hesitation
perhaps
only
accelerated
the
breach
which
their
characters
made
inevitable
sooner
or
later
both
framed
by
nature
to
give
laws
not
to
receive
them
they
could
not
long
have
in
an
enterprise
which
eminently
demanded
mutual
submission
and
sacrifices
wallenstein
was
nothing
where
he
was
not
everything
he
must
either
act
with
unlimited
power
or
not
at
all
so
cordially
too
did
gustavus
dislike
control
that
he
had
almost
renounced
his
advantageous
alliance
with
france
because
it
threatened
to
fetter
his
own
independent
judgment
wallenstein
was
lost
to
a
party
if
he
could
not
lead
the
latter
was
if
possible
still
less
disposed
to
obey
the
instructions
of
another
if
the
pretensions
of
a
rival
would
be
so
irksome
to
the
duke
of
friedland
in
the
conduct
of
combined
operations
in
the
division
of
the
spoil
they
would
be
insupportable
the
proud
monarch
might
condescend
to
accept
the
assistance
of
a
rebellious
subject
against
the
emperor
and
to
reward
his
valuable
services
with
regal
munificence
but
he
never
could
so
far
lose
sight
of
his
own
dignity
and
the
majesty
of
royalty
as
to
bestow
the
recompense
which
the
extravagant
ambition
of
wallenstein
demanded
and
requite
an
act
of
treason
however
useful
with
a
crown
in
him
therefore
even
if
all
europe
should
tacitly
acquiesce
wallenstein
had
reason
to
expect
the
most
decided
and
formidable
opponent
to
his
views
on
the
bohemian
crown
and
in
all
europe
he
was
the
only
one
who
could
enforce
his
opposition
constituted
dictator
in
germany
by
wallenstein
himself
he
might
turn
his
arms
against
him
and
consider
himself
bound
by
no
obligations
to
one
who
was
himself
a
traitor
there
was
no
room
for
a
wallenstein
under
such
an
ally
and
it
was
apparently
this
conviction
and
not
any
supposed
designs
upon
the
imperial
throne
that
he
alluded
to
when
after
the
death
of
the
king
of
sweden
he
exclaimed
it
is
well
for
him
and
me
that
he
is
gone
the
german
empire
does
not
require
two
such
leaders
his
first
scheme
of
revenge
on
the
house
of
austria
had
indeed
failed
but
the
purpose
itself
remained
unalterable
the
choice
of
means
alone
was
changed
what
he
had
failed
in
effecting
with
the
king
of
sweden
he
hoped
to
obtain
with
less
difficulty
and
more
advantage
from
the
elector
of
saxony
him
he
was
as
certain
of
being
able
to
bend
to
his
views
as
he
had
always
been
doubtful
of
gustavus
adolphus
having
always
maintained
a
good
understanding
with
his
old
friend
arnheim
he
now
made
use
of
him
to
bring
about
an
alliance
with
saxony
by
which
he
hoped
to
render
himself
equally
formidable
to
the
emperor
and
the
king
of
sweden
he
had
reason
to
expect
that
a
scheme
which
if
successful
would
deprive
the
swedish
monarch
of
his
influence
in
germany
would
be
welcomed
by
the
elector
of
saxony
who
he
knew
was
jealous
of
the
power
and
offended
at
the
lofty
pretensions
of
gustavus
adolphus
if
he
succeeded
in
separating
saxony
from
the
swedish
alliance
and
in
establishing
conjointly
with
that
power
a
third
party
in
the
empire
the
fate
of
the
war
would
be
placed
in
his
hand
and
by
this
single
step
he
would
succeed
in
gratifying
his
revenge
against
the
emperor
revenging
the
neglect
of
the
swedish
monarch
and
on
the
ruin
of
both
raising
the
edifice
of
his
own
greatness
but
whatever
course
he
might
follow
in
the
prosecution
of
his
designs
he
could
not
carry
them
into
effect
without
an
army
entirely
devoted
to
him
such
a
force
could
not
be
secretly
raised
without
its
coming
to
the
knowledge
of
the
imperial
court
where
it
would
naturally
excite
suspicion
and
thus
frustrate
his
design
in
the
very
outset
from
the
army
too
the
rebellious
purposes
for
which
it
was
destined
must
be
concealed
till
the
very
moment
of
execution
since
it
could
scarcely
be
expected
that
they
would
at
once
be
prepared
to
listen
to
the
voice
of
a
traitor
and
serve
against
their
legitimate
sovereign
wallenstein
therefore
must
raise
it
publicly
and
in
name
of
the
emperor
and
be
placed
at
its
head
with
unlimited
authority
by
the
emperor
himself
but
how
could
this
be
accomplished
otherwise
than
by
his
being
appointed
to
the
command
of
the
army
and
entrusted
with
full
powers
to
conduct
the
war
yet
neither
his
pride
nor
his
interest
permitted
him
to
sue
in
person
for
this
post
and
as
a
suppliant
to
accept
from
the
favour
of
the
emperor
a
limited
power
when
an
unlimited
authority
might
be
extorted
from
his
fears
in
order
to
make
himself
the
master
of
the
terms
on
which
he
would
resume
the
command
of
the
army
his
course
was
to
wait
until
the
post
should
be
forced
upon
him
this
was
the
advice
he
received
from
arnheim
and
this
the
end
for
which
he
laboured
with
profound
policy
and
restless
activity
convinced
that
extreme
necessity
would
alone
conquer
the
emperor
irresolution
and
render
powerless
the
opposition
of
his
bitter
enemies
bavaria
and
spain
he
henceforth
occupied
himself
in
promoting
the
success
of
the
enemy
and
in
increasing
the
embarrassments
of
his
master
it
was
apparently
by
his
instigation
and
advice
that
the
saxons
when
on
the
route
to
lusatia
and
silesia
had
turned
their
march
towards
bohemia
and
overrun
that
defenceless
kingdom
where
their
rapid
conquests
was
partly
the
result
of
his
measures
by
the
fears
which
he
affected
to
entertain
he
paralyzed
every
effort
at
resistance
and
his
precipitate
retreat
caused
the
delivery
of
the
capital
to
the
enemy
at
a
conference
with
the
saxon
general
which
was
held
at
kaunitz
under
the
pretext
of
negociating
for
a
peace
the
seal
was
put
to
the
conspiracy
and
the
conquest
of
bohemia
was
the
first
fruits
of
this
mutual
understanding
while
wallenstein
was
thus
personally
endeavouring
to
heighten
the
perplexities
of
austria
and
while
the
rapid
movements
of
the
swedes
upon
the
rhine
effectually
promoted
his
designs
his
friends
and
bribed
adherents
in
vienna
uttered
loud
complaints
of
the
public
calamities
and
represented
the
dismissal
of
the
general
as
the
sole
cause
of
all
these
misfortunes
had
wallenstein
commanded
matters
would
never
have
come
to
this
exclaimed
a
thousand
voices
while
their
opinions
found
supporters
even
in
the
emperor
privy
council
their
repeated
remonstrances
were
not
needed
to
convince
the
embarrassed
emperor
of
his
general
merits
and
of
his
own
error
his
dependence
on
bavaria
and
the
league
had
soon
become
insupportable
but
hitherto
this
dependence
permitted
him
not
to
show
his
distrust
or
irritate
the
elector
by
the
recall
of
wallenstein
but
now
when
his
necessities
grew
every
day
more
pressing
and
the
weakness
of
bavaria
more
apparent
he
could
no
longer
hesitate
to
listen
to
the
friends
of
the
duke
and
to
consider
their
overtures
for
his
restoration
to
command
the
immense
riches
wallenstein
possessed
the
universal
reputation
he
enjoyed
the
rapidity
with
which
six
years
before
he
had
assembled
an
army
of
men
the
little
expense
at
which
he
had
maintained
this
formidable
force
the
actions
he
had
performed
at
its
head
and
lastly
the
zeal
and
fidelity
he
had
displayed
for
his
master
honour
still
lived
in
the
emperor
recollection
and
made
wallenstein
seem
to
him
the
ablest
instrument
to
restore
the
balance
between
the
belligerent
powers
to
save
austria
and
preserve
the
catholic
religion
however
sensibly
the
imperial
pride
might
feel
the
humiliation
in
being
forced
to
make
so
unequivocal
an
admission
of
past
errors
and
present
necessity
however
painful
it
was
to
descend
to
humble
entreaties
from
the
height
of
imperial
command
however
doubtful
the
fidelity
of
so
deeply
injured
and
implacable
a
character
however
loudly
and
urgently
the
spanish
minister
and
the
elector
of
bavaria
protested
against
this
step
the
immediate
pressure
of
necessity
finally
overcame
every
other
consideration
and
the
friends
of
the
duke
were
empowered
to
consult
him
on
the
subject
and
to
hold
out
the
prospect
of
his
restoration
informed
of
all
that
was
transacted
in
the
emperor
cabinet
to
his
advantage
wallenstein
possessed
sufficient
to
conceal
his
inward
triumph
and
to
assume
the
mask
of
indifference
the
moment
of
vengeance
was
at
last
come
and
his
proud
heart
exulted
in
the
prospect
of
repaying
with
interest
the
injuries
of
the
emperor
with
artful
eloquence
he
expatiated
upon
the
happy
tranquillity
of
a
private
station
which
had
blessed
him
since
his
retirement
from
a
political
stage
too
long
he
said
had
he
tasted
the
pleasures
of
ease
and
independence
to
sacrifice
to
the
vain
phantom
of
glory
the
uncertain
favour
of
princes
all
his
desire
of
power
and
distinction
were
extinct
tranquillity
and
repose
were
now
the
sole
object
of
his
wishes
the
better
to
conceal
his
real
impatience
he
declined
the
emperor
invitation
to
the
court
but
at
the
same
time
to
facilitate
the
negociations
came
to
znaim
in
moravia
at
first
it
was
proposed
to
limit
the
authority
to
be
intrusted
to
him
by
the
presence
of
a
superior
in
order
by
this
expedient
to
silence
the
objections
of
the
elector
of
bavaria
the
imperial
deputies
questenberg
and
werdenberg
who
as
old
friends
of
the
duke
had
been
employed
in
this
delicate
mission
were
instructed
to
propose
that
the
king
of
hungary
should
remain
with
the
army
and
learn
the
art
of
war
under
wallenstein
but
the
very
mention
of
his
name
threatened
to
put
a
period
to
the
whole
negociation
no
never
exclaimed
wallenstein
will
i
submit
to
a
colleague
in
my
office
no
not
even
if
it
were
god
himself
with
whom
i
should
have
to
share
my
command
but
even
when
this
obnoxious
point
was
given
up
prince
eggenberg
the
emperor
minister
and
favourite
who
had
always
been
the
steady
friend
and
zealous
champion
of
wallenstein
and
was
therefore
expressly
sent
to
him
exhausted
his
eloquence
in
vain
to
overcome
the
pretended
reluctance
of
the
duke
the
emperor
he
admitted
had
in
wallenstein
thrown
away
the
most
costly
jewel
in
his
crown
but
unwillingly
and
compulsorily
only
had
he
taken
this
step
which
he
had
since
deeply
repented
of
while
his
esteem
for
the
duke
had
remained
unaltered
his
favour
for
him
undiminished
of
these
sentiments
he
now
gave
the
most
decisive
proof
by
reposing
unlimited
confidence
in
his
fidelity
and
capacity
to
repair
the
mistakes
of
his
predecessors
and
to
change
the
whole
aspect
of
affairs
it
would
be
great
and
noble
to
sacrifice
his
just
indignation
to
the
good
of
his
country
dignified
and
worthy
of
him
to
refute
the
evil
calumny
of
his
enemies
by
the
double
warmth
of
his
zeal
this
victory
over
himself
concluded
the
prince
would
crown
his
other
unparalleled
services
to
the
empire
and
render
him
the
greatest
man
of
his
age
these
humiliating
confessions
and
flattering
assurances
seemed
at
last
to
disarm
the
anger
of
the
duke
but
not
before
he
had
disburdened
his
heart
of
his
reproaches
against
the
emperor
pompously
dwelt
upon
his
own
services
and
humbled
to
the
utmost
the
monarch
who
solicited
his
assistance
did
he
condescend
to
listen
to
the
attractive
proposals
of
the
minister
as
if
he
yielded
entirely
to
the
force
of
their
arguments
he
condescended
with
a
haughty
reluctance
to
that
which
was
the
most
ardent
wish
of
his
heart
and
deigned
to
favour
the
ambassadors
with
a
ray
of
hope
but
far
from
putting
an
end
to
the
emperor
embarrassments
by
giving
at
once
a
full
and
unconditional
consent
he
only
acceded
to
a
part
of
his
demands
that
he
might
exalt
the
value
of
that
which
still
remained
and
was
of
most
importance
he
accepted
the
command
but
only
for
three
months
merely
for
the
purpose
of
raising
but
not
of
leading
an
army
he
wished
only
to
show
his
power
and
ability
in
its
organization
and
to
display
before
the
eyes
of
the
emperor
the
greatness
of
that
assistance
which
he
still
retained
in
his
hands
convinced
that
an
army
raised
by
his
name
alone
would
if
deprived
of
its
creator
soon
sink
again
into
nothing
he
intended
it
to
serve
only
as
a
decoy
to
draw
more
important
concessions
from
his
master
and
yet
ferdinand
congratulated
himself
even
in
having
gained
so
much
as
he
had
wallenstein
did
not
long
delay
to
fulfil
those
promises
which
all
germany
regarded
as
chimerical
and
which
gustavus
adolphus
had
considered
as
extravagant
but
the
foundation
for
the
present
enterprise
had
been
long
laid
and
he
now
only
put
in
motion
the
machinery
which
many
years
had
been
prepared
for
the
purpose
scarcely
had
the
news
spread
of
wallenstein
levies
when
from
every
quarter
of
the
austrian
monarchy
crowds
of
soldiers
repaired
to
try
their
fortunes
under
this
experienced
general
many
who
had
before
fought
under
his
standards
had
been
admiring
of
his
great
actions
and
experienced
his
magnanimity
came
forward
from
their
retirement
to
share
with
him
a
second
time
both
booty
and
glory
the
greatness
of
the
pay
he
promised
attracted
thousands
and
the
plentiful
supplies
the
soldier
was
likely
to
enjoy
at
the
cost
of
the
peasant
was
to
the
latter
an
irresistible
inducement
to
embrace
the
military
life
at
once
rather
than
be
the
victim
of
its
oppression
all
the
austrian
provinces
were
compelled
to
assist
in
the
equipment
no
class
was
exempt
from
taxation
no
dignity
or
privilege
from
capitation
the
spanish
court
as
well
as
the
king
of
hungary
agreed
to
contribute
a
considerable
sum
the
ministers
made
large
presents
while
wallenstein
himself
advanced
dollars
from
his
own
income
to
hasten
the
armament
the
poorer
officers
he
supported
out
of
his
own
revenues
and
by
his
own
example
by
brilliant
promotions
and
still
more
brilliant
promises
he
induced
all
who
were
able
to
raise
troops
at
their
own
expense
whoever
raised
a
corps
at
his
own
cost
was
to
be
its
commander
in
the
appointment
of
officers
religion
made
no
difference
riches
bravery
and
experience
were
more
regarded
than
creed
by
this
uniform
treatment
of
different
religious
sects
and
still
more
by
his
express
declaration
that
his
present
levy
had
nothing
to
do
with
religion
the
protestant
subjects
of
the
empire
were
tranquillized
and
reconciled
to
bear
their
share
of
the
public
burdens
the
duke
at
the
same
time
did
not
omit
to
treat
in
his
own
name
with
foreign
states
for
men
and
money
he
prevailed
on
the
duke
of
lorraine
a
second
time
to
espouse
the
cause
of
the
emperor
poland
was
urged
to
supply
him
with
cossacks
and
italy
with
warlike
necessaries
before
the
three
months
were
expired
the
army
which
was
assembled
in
moravia
amounted
to
no
less
than
men
chiefly
drawn
from
the
unconquered
parts
of
bohemia
from
moravia
silesia
and
the
german
provinces
of
the
house
of
austria
what
to
every
one
had
appeared
impracticable
wallenstein
to
the
astonishment
of
all
europe
had
in
a
short
time
effected
the
charm
of
his
name
his
treasures
and
his
genius
had
assembled
thousands
in
arms
where
before
austria
had
only
looked
for
hundreds
furnished
even
to
superfluity
with
all
necessaries
commanded
by
experienced
officers
and
inflamed
by
enthusiasm
which
assured
itself
of
victory
this
newly
created
army
only
awaited
the
signal
of
their
leader
to
show
themselves
by
the
bravery
of
their
deeds
worthy
of
his
choice
the
duke
had
fulfilled
his
promise
and
the
troops
were
ready
to
take
the
field
he
then
retired
and
left
to
the
emperor
to
choose
a
commander
but
it
would
have
been
as
easy
to
raise
a
second
army
like
the
first
as
to
find
any
other
commander
for
it
than
wallenstein
this
promising
army
the
last
hope
of
the
emperor
was
nothing
but
an
illusion
as
soon
as
the
charm
was
dissolved
which
had
called
it
into
existence
by
wallenstein
it
had
been
raised
and
without
him
it
sank
like
a
creation
of
magic
into
its
original
nothingness
its
officers
were
either
bound
to
him
as
his
debtors
or
as
his
creditors
closely
connected
with
his
interests
and
the
preservation
of
his
power
the
regiments
he
had
entrusted
to
his
own
relations
creatures
and
favourites
he
and
he
alone
could
discharge
to
the
troops
the
extravagant
promises
by
which
they
had
been
lured
into
his
service
his
pledged
word
was
the
only
security
on
which
their
bold
expectations
rested
a
blind
reliance
on
his
omnipotence
the
only
tie
which
linked
together
in
one
common
life
and
soul
the
various
impulses
of
their
zeal
there
was
an
end
of
the
good
fortune
of
each
individual
if
he
retired
who
alone
was
the
voucher
of
its
fulfilment
however
little
wallenstein
was
serious
in
his
refusal
he
successfully
employed
this
means
to
terrify
the
emperor
into
consenting
to
his
extravagant
conditions
the
progress
of
the
enemy
every
day
increased
the
pressure
of
the
emperor
difficulties
while
the
remedy
was
also
close
at
hand
a
word
from
him
might
terminate
the
general
embarrassment
prince
eggenberg
at
length
received
orders
for
the
third
and
last
time
at
any
cost
and
sacrifice
to
induce
his
friend
wallenstein
to
accept
the
command
he
found
him
at
znaim
in
moravia
pompously
surrounded
by
the
troops
the
possession
of
which
he
made
the
emperor
so
earnestly
to
long
for
as
a
suppliant
did
the
haughty
subject
receive
the
deputy
of
his
sovereign
he
never
could
trust
he
said
to
a
restoration
to
command
which
he
owed
to
the
emperor
necessities
and
not
to
his
sense
of
justice
he
was
now
courted
because
the
danger
had
reached
its
height
and
safety
was
hoped
for
from
his
arm
only
but
his
successful
services
would
soon
cause
the
servant
to
be
forgotten
and
the
return
of
security
would
bring
back
renewed
ingratitude
if
he
deceived
the
expectations
formed
of
him
his
long
earned
renown
would
be
forfeited
even
if
he
fulfilled
them
his
repose
and
happiness
must
be
sacrificed
soon
would
envy
be
excited
anew
and
the
dependent
monarch
would
not
hesitate
a
second
time
to
make
an
offering
of
convenience
to
a
servant
whom
he
could
now
dispense
with
better
for
him
at
once
and
voluntarily
to
resign
a
post
from
which
sooner
or
later
the
intrigues
of
his
enemies
would
expel
him
security
and
content
were
to
be
found
in
the
bosom
of
private
life
and
nothing
but
the
wish
to
oblige
the
emperor
had
induced
him
reluctantly
enough
to
relinquish
for
a
time
his
blissful
repose
tired
of
this
long
farce
the
minister
at
last
assumed
a
serious
tone
and
threatened
the
obstinate
duke
with
the
emperor
resentment
if
he
persisted
in
his
refusal
low
enough
had
the
imperial
dignity
he
added
stooped
already
and
yet
instead
of
exciting
his
magnanimity
by
its
condescension
had
only
flattered
his
pride
and
increased
his
obstinacy
if
this
sacrifice
had
been
made
in
vain
he
would
not
answer
but
that
the
suppliant
might
be
converted
into
the
sovereign
and
that
the
monarch
might
not
avenge
his
injured
dignity
on
his
rebellious
subject
however
greatly
ferdinand
may
have
erred
the
emperor
at
least
had
a
claim
to
obedience
the
man
might
be
mistaken
but
the
monarch
could
not
confess
his
error
if
the
duke
of
friedland
had
suffered
by
an
unjust
decree
he
might
yet
be
recompensed
for
all
his
losses
the
wound
which
it
had
itself
inflicted
the
hand
of
majesty
might
heal
if
he
asked
security
for
his
person
and
his
dignities
the
emperor
equity
would
refuse
him
no
reasonable
demand
majesty
contemned
admitted
not
of
any
atonement
disobedience
to
its
commands
cancelled
the
most
brilliant
services
the
emperor
required
his
services
and
as
emperor
he
demanded
them
whatever
price
wallenstein
might
set
upon
them
the
emperor
would
readily
agree
to
but
he
demanded
obedience
or
the
weight
of
his
indignation
should
crush
the
refractory
servant
wallenstein
whose
extensive
possessions
within
the
austrian
monarchy
were
momentarily
exposed
to
the
power
of
the
emperor
was
keenly
sensible
that
this
was
no
idle
threat
yet
it
was
not
fear
that
at
last
overcame
his
affected
reluctance
this
imperious
tone
of
itself
was
to
his
mind
a
plain
proof
of
the
weakness
and
despair
which
dictated
it
while
the
emperor
readiness
to
yield
all
his
demands
convinced
him
that
he
had
attained
the
summit
of
his
wishes
he
now
made
a
show
of
yielding
to
the
persuasions
of
eggenberg
and
left
him
in
order
to
write
down
the
conditions
on
which
he
accepted
the
command
not
without
apprehension
did
the
minister
receive
the
writing
in
which
the
proudest
of
subjects
had
prescribed
laws
to
the
proudest
of
sovereigns
but
however
little
confidence
he
had
in
the
moderation
of
his
friend
the
extravagant
contents
of
his
writing
surpassed
even
his
worst
expectations
wallenstein
required
the
uncontrolled
command
over
all
the
german
armies
of
austria
and
spain
with
unlimited
powers
to
reward
and
punish
neither
the
king
of
hungary
nor
the
emperor
himself
were
to
appear
in
the
army
still
less
to
exercise
any
act
of
authority
over
it
no
commission
in
the
army
no
pension
or
letter
of
grace
was
to
be
granted
by
the
emperor
without
wallenstein
approval
all
the
conquests
and
confiscations
that
should
take
place
were
to
be
placed
entirely
at
wallenstein
disposal
to
the
exclusion
of
every
other
tribunal
for
his
ordinary
pay
an
imperial
hereditary
estate
was
to
be
assigned
him
with
another
of
the
conquered
estates
within
the
empire
for
his
extraordinary
expenses
every
austrian
province
was
to
be
opened
to
him
if
he
required
it
in
case
of
retreat
he
farther
demanded
the
assurance
of
the
possession
of
the
duchy
of
mecklenburg
in
the
event
of
a
future
peace
and
a
formal
and
timely
intimation
if
it
should
be
deemed
necessary
a
second
time
to
deprive
him
of
the
command
in
vain
the
minister
entreated
him
to
moderate
his
demands
which
if
granted
would
deprive
the
emperor
of
all
authority
over
his
own
troops
and
make
him
absolutely
dependent
on
his
general
the
value
placed
on
his
services
had
been
too
plainly
manifested
to
prevent
him
dictating
the
price
at
which
they
were
to
be
purchased
if
the
pressure
of
circumstances
compelled
the
emperor
to
grant
these
demands
it
was
more
than
a
mere
feeling
of
haughtiness
and
desire
of
revenge
which
induced
the
duke
to
make
them
his
plans
of
rebellion
were
formed
to
their
success
every
one
of
the
conditions
for
which
wallenstein
stipulated
in
this
treaty
with
the
court
was
indispensable
those
plans
required
that
the
emperor
should
be
deprived
of
all
authority
in
germany
and
be
placed
at
the
mercy
of
his
general
and
this
object
would
be
attained
the
moment
ferdinand
subscribed
the
required
conditions
the
use
which
wallenstein
intended
to
make
of
his
army
widely
different
indeed
from
that
for
which
it
was
entrusted
to
him
brooked
not
of
a
divided
power
and
still
less
of
an
authority
superior
to
his
own
to
be
the
sole
master
of
the
will
of
his
troops
he
must
also
be
the
sole
master
of
their
destinies
insensibly
to
supplant
his
sovereign
and
to
transfer
permanently
to
his
own
person
the
rights
of
sovereignty
which
were
only
lent
to
him
for
a
time
by
a
higher
authority
he
must
cautiously
keep
the
latter
out
of
the
view
of
the
army
hence
his
obstinate
refusal
to
allow
any
prince
of
the
house
of
austria
to
be
present
with
the
army
the
liberty
of
free
disposal
of
all
the
conquered
and
confiscated
estates
in
the
empire
would
also
afford
him
fearful
means
of
purchasing
dependents
and
instruments
of
his
plans
and
of
acting
the
dictator
in
germany
more
absolutely
than
ever
any
emperor
did
in
time
of
peace
by
the
right
to
use
any
of
the
austrian
provinces
as
a
place
of
refuge
in
case
of
need
he
had
full
power
to
hold
the
emperor
a
prisoner
by
means
of
his
own
forces
and
within
his
own
dominions
to
exhaust
the
strength
and
resources
of
these
countries
and
to
undermine
the
power
of
austria
in
its
very
foundation
whatever
might
be
the
issue
he
had
equally
secured
his
own
advantage
by
the
conditions
he
had
extorted
from
the
emperor
if
circumstances
proved
favourable
to
his
daring
project
this
treaty
with
the
emperor
facilitated
its
execution
if
on
the
contrary
the
course
of
things
ran
counter
to
it
it
would
at
least
afford
him
a
brilliant
compensation
for
the
failure
of
his
plans
but
how
could
he
consider
an
agreement
valid
which
was
extorted
from
his
sovereign
and
based
upon
treason
how
could
he
hope
to
bind
the
emperor
by
a
written
agreement
in
the
face
of
a
law
which
condemned
to
death
every
one
who
should
have
the
presumption
to
impose
conditions
upon
him
but
this
criminal
was
the
most
indispensable
man
in
the
empire
and
ferdinand
well
practised
in
dissimulation
granted
him
for
the
present
all
he
required
at
last
then
the
imperial
army
had
found
a
worthy
of
the
name
every
other
authority
in
the
army
even
that
of
the
emperor
himself
ceased
from
the
moment
wallenstein
assumed
the
commander
baton
and
every
act
was
invalid
which
did
not
proceed
from
him
from
the
banks
of
the
danube
to
those
of
the
weser
and
the
oder
was
felt
the
dawning
of
this
new
star
a
new
spirit
seemed
to
inspire
the
troops
of
the
emperor
a
new
epoch
of
the
war
began
the
papists
form
fresh
hopes
the
protestant
beholds
with
anxiety
the
changed
course
of
affairs
the
greater
the
price
at
which
the
services
of
the
new
general
had
been
purchased
the
greater
justly
were
the
expectations
from
those
which
the
court
of
the
emperor
entertained
but
the
duke
was
in
no
hurry
to
fulfil
these
expectations
already
in
the
vicinity
of
bohemia
and
at
the
head
of
a
formidable
force
he
had
but
to
show
himself
there
in
order
to
overpower
the
exhausted
force
of
the
saxons
and
brilliantly
to
commence
his
new
career
by
the
reconquest
of
that
kingdom
but
contented
with
harassing
the
enemy
with
indecisive
skirmishes
of
his
croats
he
abandoned
the
best
part
of
that
kingdom
to
be
plundered
and
moved
calmly
forward
in
pursuit
of
his
own
selfish
plans
his
design
was
not
to
conquer
the
saxons
but
to
unite
with
them
exclusively
occupied
with
this
important
object
he
remained
inactive
in
the
hope
of
conquering
more
surely
by
means
of
negociation
he
left
no
expedient
untried
to
detach
this
prince
from
the
swedish
alliance
and
ferdinand
himself
ever
inclined
to
an
accommodation
with
this
prince
approved
of
this
proceeding
but
the
great
debt
which
saxony
owed
to
sweden
was
as
yet
too
freshly
remembered
to
allow
of
such
an
act
of
perfidy
and
even
had
the
elector
been
disposed
to
yield
to
the
temptation
the
equivocal
character
of
wallenstein
and
the
bad
character
of
austrian
policy
precluded
any
reliance
in
the
integrity
of
its
promises
notorious
already
as
a
treacherous
statesman
he
met
not
with
faith
upon
the
very
occasion
when
perhaps
he
intended
to
act
honestly
and
moreover
was
denied
by
circumstances
the
opportunity
of
proving
the
sincerity
of
his
intentions
by
the
disclosure
of
his
real
motives
he
therefore
unwillingly
resolved
to
extort
by
force
of
arms
what
he
could
not
obtain
by
negociation
suddenly
assembling
his
troops
he
appeared
before
prague
ere
the
saxons
had
time
to
advance
to
its
relief
after
a
short
resistance
the
treachery
of
some
capuchins
opens
the
gates
to
one
of
his
regiments
and
the
garrison
who
had
taken
refuge
in
the
citadel
soon
laid
down
their
arms
upon
disgraceful
conditions
master
of
the
capital
he
hoped
to
carry
on
more
successfully
his
negociations
at
the
saxon
court
but
even
while
he
was
renewing
his
proposals
to
arnheim
he
did
not
hesitate
to
give
them
weight
by
striking
a
decisive
blow
he
hastened
to
seize
the
narrow
passes
between
aussig
and
pirna
with
a
view
of
cutting
off
the
retreat
of
the
saxons
into
their
own
country
but
the
rapidity
of
arnheim
operations
fortunately
extricated
them
from
the
danger
after
the
retreat
of
this
general
egra
and
leutmeritz
the
last
strongholds
of
the
saxons
surrendered
to
the
conqueror
and
the
whole
kingdom
was
restored
to
its
legitimate
sovereign
in
less
time
than
it
had
been
lost
wallenstein
less
occupied
with
the
interests
of
his
master
than
with
the
furtherance
of
his
own
plans
now
purposed
to
carry
the
war
into
saxony
and
by
ravaging
his
territories
compel
the
elector
to
enter
into
a
private
treaty
with
the
emperor
or
rather
with
himself
but
however
little
accustomed
he
was
to
make
his
will
bend
to
circumstances
he
now
perceived
the
necessity
of
postponing
his
favourite
scheme
for
a
time
to
a
more
pressing
emergency
while
he
was
driving
the
saxons
from
bohemia
gustavus
adolphus
had
been
gaining
the
victories
already
detailed
on
the
rhine
and
the
danube
and
carried
the
war
through
franconia
and
swabia
to
the
frontiers
of
bavaria
maximilian
defeated
on
the
lech
and
deprived
by
death
of
count
tilly
his
best
support
urgently
solicited
the
emperor
to
send
with
all
speed
the
duke
of
friedland
to
his
assistance
from
bohemia
and
by
the
defence
of
bavaria
to
avert
the
danger
from
austria
itself
he
also
made
the
same
request
to
wallenstein
and
entreated
him
till
he
could
himself
come
with
the
main
force
to
despatch
in
the
mean
time
a
few
regiments
to
his
aid
ferdinand
seconded
the
request
with
all
his
influence
and
one
messenger
after
another
was
sent
to
wallenstein
urging
him
to
move
towards
the
danube
it
now
appeared
how
completely
the
emperor
had
sacrificed
his
authority
in
surrendering
to
another
the
supreme
command
of
his
troops
indifferent
to
maximilian
entreaties
and
deaf
to
the
repeated
commands
wallenstein
remained
inactive
in
bohemia
and
abandoned
the
elector
to
his
fate
the
remembrance
of
the
evil
service
which
maximilian
had
rendered
him
with
the
emperor
at
the
diet
at
ratisbon
was
deeply
engraved
on
the
implacable
mind
of
the
duke
and
the
elector
late
attempts
to
prevent
his
reinstatement
were
no
secret
to
him
the
moment
of
revenging
this
affront
had
now
arrived
and
maximilian
was
doomed
to
pay
dearly
for
his
folly
in
provoking
the
most
revengeful
of
men
wallenstein
maintained
that
bohemia
ought
not
to
be
left
exposed
and
that
austria
could
not
be
better
protected
than
by
allowing
the
swedish
army
to
waste
its
strength
before
the
bavarian
fortress
thus
by
the
arm
of
the
swedes
he
chastised
his
enemy
and
while
one
place
after
another
fell
into
their
hands
he
allowed
the
elector
vainly
to
await
his
arrival
in
ratisbon
it
was
only
when
the
complete
subjugation
of
bohemia
left
him
without
excuse
and
the
conquests
of
gustavus
adolphus
in
bavaria
threatened
austria
itself
that
he
yielded
to
the
pressing
entreaties
of
the
elector
and
the
emperor
and
determined
to
effect
the
union
with
the
former
an
event
which
according
to
the
general
anticipation
of
the
roman
catholics
would
decide
the
fate
of
the
campaign
gustavus
adolphus
too
weak
in
numbers
to
cope
even
with
wallenstein
force
alone
naturally
dreaded
the
junction
of
such
powerful
armies
and
the
little
energy
he
used
to
prevent
it
was
the
occasion
of
great
surprise
apparently
he
reckoned
too
much
on
the
hatred
which
alienated
the
leaders
and
seemed
to
render
their
effectual
improbable
when
the
event
contradicted
his
views
it
was
too
late
to
repair
his
error
on
the
first
certain
intelligence
he
received
of
their
designs
he
hastened
to
the
upper
palatinate
for
the
purpose
of
intercepting
the
elector
but
the
latter
had
already
arrived
there
and
the
junction
had
been
effected
at
egra
this
frontier
town
had
been
chosen
by
wallenstein
for
the
scene
of
his
triumph
over
his
proud
rival
not
content
with
having
seen
him
as
it
were
a
suppliant
at
his
feet
he
imposed
upon
him
the
hard
condition
of
leaving
his
territories
in
his
rear
exposed
to
the
enemy
and
declaring
by
this
long
march
to
meet
him
the
necessity
and
distress
to
which
he
was
reduced
even
to
this
humiliation
the
haughty
prince
patiently
submitted
it
had
cost
him
a
severe
struggle
to
ask
for
protection
of
the
man
who
if
his
own
wishes
had
been
consulted
would
never
have
had
the
power
of
granting
it
but
having
once
made
up
his
mind
to
it
he
was
ready
to
bear
all
the
annoyances
which
were
inseparable
from
that
resolve
and
sufficiently
master
of
himself
to
put
up
with
petty
grievances
when
an
important
end
was
in
view
but
whatever
pains
it
had
cost
to
effect
this
junction
it
was
equally
difficult
to
settle
the
conditions
on
which
it
was
to
be
maintained
the
united
army
must
be
placed
under
the
command
of
one
individual
if
any
object
was
to
be
gained
by
the
union
and
each
general
was
equally
averse
to
yield
to
the
superior
authority
of
the
other
if
maximilian
rested
his
claim
on
his
electoral
dignity
the
nobleness
of
his
descent
and
his
influence
in
the
empire
wallenstein
military
renown
and
the
unlimited
command
conferred
on
him
by
the
emperor
gave
an
equally
strong
title
to
it
if
it
was
deeply
humiliating
to
the
pride
of
the
former
to
serve
under
an
imperial
subject
the
idea
of
imposing
laws
on
so
imperious
a
spirit
flattered
in
the
same
degree
the
haughtiness
of
wallenstein
an
obstinate
dispute
ensued
which
however
terminated
in
a
mutual
compromise
to
wallenstein
advantage
to
him
was
assigned
the
unlimited
command
of
both
armies
particularly
in
battle
while
the
elector
was
deprived
of
all
power
of
altering
the
order
of
battle
or
even
the
route
of
the
army
he
retained
only
the
bare
right
of
punishing
and
rewarding
his
own
troops
and
the
free
use
of
these
when
not
acting
in
conjunction
with
the
imperialists
after
these
preliminaries
were
settled
the
two
generals
at
last
ventured
upon
an
interview
but
not
until
they
had
mutually
promised
to
bury
the
past
in
oblivion
and
all
the
outward
formalities
of
a
reconciliation
had
been
settled
according
to
agreement
they
publicly
embraced
in
the
sight
of
their
troops
and
made
mutual
professions
of
friendship
while
in
reality
the
hearts
of
both
were
overflowing
with
malice
maximilian
well
versed
in
dissimulation
had
sufficient
command
over
himself
not
to
betray
in
a
single
feature
his
real
feelings
but
a
malicious
triumph
sparkled
in
the
eyes
of
wallenstein
and
the
constraint
which
was
visible
in
all
his
movements
betrayed
the
violence
of
the
emotion
which
overpowered
his
proud
soul
the
combined
imperial
and
bavarian
armies
amounted
to
nearly
men
chiefly
veterans
before
this
force
the
king
of
sweden
was
not
in
a
condition
to
keep
the
field
as
his
attempt
to
prevent
their
junction
had
failed
he
commenced
a
rapid
retreat
into
franconia
and
awaited
there
for
some
decisive
movement
on
the
part
of
the
enemy
in
order
to
form
his
own
plans
the
position
of
the
combined
armies
between
the
frontiers
of
saxony
and
bavaria
left
it
for
some
time
doubtful
whether
they
would
remove
the
war
into
the
former
or
endeavour
to
drive
the
swedes
from
the
danube
and
deliver
bavaria
saxony
had
been
stripped
of
troops
by
arnheim
who
was
pursuing
his
conquests
in
silesia
not
without
a
secret
design
it
was
generally
supposed
of
favouring
the
entrance
of
the
duke
of
friedland
into
that
electorate
and
of
thus
driving
the
irresolute
john
george
into
peace
with
the
emperor
gustavus
adolphus
himself
fully
persuaded
that
wallenstein
views
were
directed
against
saxony
hastily
despatched
a
strong
reinforcement
to
the
assistance
of
his
confederate
with
the
intention
as
soon
as
circumstances
would
allow
of
following
with
the
main
body
but
the
movements
of
wallenstein
army
soon
led
him
to
suspect
that
he
himself
was
the
object
of
attack
and
the
duke
march
through
the
upper
palatinate
placed
the
matter
beyond
a
doubt
the
question
now
was
how
to
provide
for
his
own
security
and
the
prize
was
no
longer
his
supremacy
but
his
very
existence
his
fertile
genius
must
now
supply
the
means
not
of
conquest
but
of
preservation
the
approach
of
the
enemy
had
surprised
him
before
he
had
time
to
concentrate
his
troops
which
were
scattered
all
over
germany
or
to
summon
his
allies
to
his
aid
too
weak
to
meet
the
enemy
in
the
field
he
had
no
choice
left
but
either
to
throw
himself
into
nuremberg
and
run
the
risk
of
being
shut
up
in
its
walls
or
to
sacrifice
that
city
and
await
a
reinforcement
under
the
cannon
of
donauwerth
indifferent
to
danger
or
difficulty
while
he
obeyed
the
call
of
humanity
or
honour
he
chose
the
first
without
hesitation
firmly
resolved
to
bury
himself
with
his
whole
army
under
the
ruins
of
nuremberg
rather
than
to
purchase
his
own
safety
by
the
sacrifice
of
his
confederates
measures
were
immediately
taken
to
surround
the
city
and
suburbs
with
redoubts
and
to
form
an
entrenched
camp
several
thousand
workmen
immediately
commenced
this
extensive
work
and
an
heroic
determination
to
hazard
life
and
property
in
the
common
cause
animated
the
inhabitants
of
nuremberg
a
trench
eight
feet
deep
and
twelve
broad
surrounded
the
whole
fortification
the
lines
were
defended
by
redoubts
and
batteries
the
gates
by
half
moons
the
river
pegnitz
which
flows
through
nuremberg
divided
the
whole
camp
into
two
semicircles
whose
communication
was
secured
by
several
bridges
about
three
hundred
pieces
of
cannon
defended
the
and
the
intrenchments
the
peasantry
from
the
neighbouring
villages
and
the
inhabitants
of
nuremberg
assisted
the
swedish
soldiers
so
zealously
that
on
the
seventh
day
the
army
was
able
to
enter
the
camp
and
in
a
fortnight
this
great
work
was
completed
while
these
operations
were
carried
on
without
the
walls
the
magistrates
of
nuremberg
were
busily
occupied
in
filling
the
magazines
with
provisions
and
ammunition
for
a
long
siege
measures
were
taken
at
the
same
time
to
secure
the
health
of
the
inhabitants
which
was
likely
to
be
endangered
by
the
conflux
of
so
many
people
cleanliness
was
enforced
by
the
strictest
regulations
in
order
if
necessary
to
support
the
king
the
youth
of
the
city
were
embodied
and
trained
to
arms
the
militia
of
the
town
considerably
reinforced
and
a
new
regiment
raised
consisting
of
names
according
to
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
gustavus
had
in
the
mean
time
called
to
his
assistance
his
allies
duke
william
of
weimar
and
the
landgrave
of
hesse
cassel
and
ordered
his
generals
on
the
rhine
in
thuringia
and
lower
saxony
to
commence
their
march
immediately
and
join
him
with
their
troops
in
nuremberg
his
army
which
was
encamped
within
the
lines
did
not
amount
to
more
than
men
scarcely
a
third
of
the
enemy
the
imperialists
had
in
the
mean
time
by
slow
marches
advanced
to
neumark
where
wallenstein
made
a
general
review
at
the
sight
of
this
formidable
force
he
could
not
refrain
from
indulging
in
a
childish
boast
in
four
days
said
he
it
will
be
shown
whether
i
or
the
king
of
sweden
is
to
be
master
of
the
world
yet
notwithstanding
his
superiority
he
did
nothing
to
fulfil
his
promise
and
even
let
slip
the
opportunity
of
crushing
his
enemy
when
the
latter
had
the
hardihood
to
leave
his
lines
to
meet
him
battles
enough
have
been
fought
was
his
answer
to
those
who
advised
him
to
attack
the
king
it
is
now
time
to
try
another
method
wallenstein
reputation
required
not
any
of
those
rash
enterprises
on
which
younger
soldiers
rush
in
the
hope
of
gaining
a
name
satisfied
that
the
enemy
despair
would
dearly
sell
a
victory
while
a
defeat
would
irretrievably
ruin
the
emperor
affairs
he
resolved
to
wear
out
the
ardour
of
his
opponent
by
a
tedious
blockade
and
by
thus
depriving
him
of
every
opportunity
of
availing
himself
of
his
impetuous
bravery
take
from
him
the
very
advantage
which
had
hitherto
rendered
him
invincible
without
making
any
attack
therefore
he
erected
a
strong
fortified
camp
on
the
other
side
of
the
pegnitz
and
opposite
nuremberg
and
by
this
well
chosen
position
cut
off
from
the
city
and
the
camp
of
gustavus
all
supplies
from
franconia
swabia
and
thuringia
thus
he
held
in
siege
at
once
the
city
and
the
king
and
flattered
himself
with
the
hope
of
slowly
but
surely
wearing
out
by
famine
and
pestilence
the
courage
of
his
opponent
whom
he
had
no
wish
to
encounter
in
the
field
little
aware
however
of
the
resources
and
the
strength
of
his
adversary
wallenstein
had
not
taken
sufficient
precautions
to
avert
from
himself
the
fate
he
was
designing
for
others
from
the
whole
of
the
neighbouring
country
the
peasantry
had
fled
with
their
property
and
what
little
provision
remained
must
be
obstinately
contested
with
the
swedes
the
king
spared
the
magazines
within
the
town
as
long
as
it
was
possible
to
provision
his
army
from
without
and
these
forays
produced
constant
skirmishes
between
the
croats
and
the
swedish
cavalry
of
which
the
surrounding
country
exhibited
the
most
melancholy
traces
the
necessaries
of
life
must
be
obtained
sword
in
hand
and
the
foraging
parties
could
not
venture
out
without
a
numerous
escort
and
when
this
supply
failed
the
town
opened
its
magazines
to
the
king
but
wallenstein
had
to
support
his
troops
from
a
distance
a
large
convoy
from
bavaria
was
on
its
way
to
him
with
an
escort
of
a
thousand
men
gustavus
adolphus
having
received
intelligence
of
its
approach
immediately
sent
out
a
regiment
of
cavalry
to
intercept
it
and
the
darkness
of
the
night
favoured
the
enterprise
the
whole
convoy
with
the
town
in
which
it
was
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
swedes
the
imperial
escort
was
cut
to
pieces
about
cattle
carried
off
and
a
thousand
waggons
loaded
with
bread
which
could
not
be
brought
away
were
set
on
fire
seven
regiments
which
wallenstein
had
sent
forward
to
altdorp
to
cover
the
entrance
of
the
long
and
anxiously
expected
convoy
were
attacked
by
the
king
who
had
in
like
manner
advanced
to
cover
the
retreat
of
his
cavalry
and
routed
after
an
obstinate
action
being
driven
back
into
the
imperial
camp
with
the
loss
of
men
so
many
checks
and
difficulties
and
so
firm
and
unexpected
a
resistance
on
the
part
of
the
king
made
the
duke
of
friedland
repent
that
he
had
declined
to
hazard
a
battle
the
strength
of
the
swedish
camp
rendered
an
attack
impracticable
and
the
armed
youth
of
nuremberg
served
the
king
as
a
nursery
from
which
he
could
supply
his
loss
of
troops
the
want
of
provisions
which
began
to
be
felt
in
the
imperial
camp
as
strongly
as
in
the
swedish
rendered
it
uncertain
which
party
would
be
first
compelled
to
give
way
fifteen
days
had
the
two
armies
now
remained
in
view
of
each
other
equally
defended
by
inaccessible
entrenchments
without
attempting
anything
more
than
slight
attacks
and
unimportant
skirmishes
on
both
sides
infectious
diseases
the
natural
consequence
of
bad
food
and
a
crowded
population
had
occasioned
a
greater
loss
than
the
sword
and
this
evil
daily
increased
but
at
length
the
long
expected
succours
arrived
in
the
swedish
camp
and
by
this
strong
reinforcement
the
king
was
now
enabled
to
obey
the
dictates
of
his
native
courage
and
to
break
the
chains
which
had
hitherto
fettered
him
in
obedience
to
his
requisitions
the
duke
of
weimar
had
hastily
drawn
together
a
corps
from
the
garrisons
in
lower
saxony
and
thuringia
which
at
schweinfurt
in
franconia
was
joined
by
four
saxon
regiments
and
at
kitzingen
by
the
corps
of
the
rhine
which
the
landgrave
of
hesse
and
the
palatine
of
birkenfeld
despatched
to
the
relief
of
the
king
the
chancellor
oxenstiern
undertook
to
lead
this
force
to
its
destination
after
being
joined
at
windsheim
by
the
duke
of
weimar
himself
and
the
swedish
general
banner
he
advanced
by
rapid
marches
to
bruck
and
eltersdorf
where
he
passed
the
rednitz
and
reached
the
swedish
camp
in
safety
this
reinforcement
amounted
to
nearly
men
and
was
attended
by
a
train
of
pieces
of
cannon
and
baggage
waggons
gustavus
now
saw
himself
at
the
head
of
an
army
of
nearly
strong
without
reckoning
the
militia
of
nuremberg
which
in
case
of
necessity
could
bring
into
the
field
about
fighting
men
a
formidable
force
opposed
to
another
not
less
formidable
the
war
seemed
at
length
compressed
to
the
point
of
a
single
battle
which
was
to
decide
its
fearful
issue
with
divided
sympathies
europe
looked
with
anxiety
to
this
scene
where
the
whole
strength
of
the
two
contending
parties
was
fearfully
drawn
as
it
were
to
a
focus
if
before
the
arrival
of
the
swedish
succours
a
want
of
provisions
had
been
felt
the
evil
was
now
fearfully
increased
to
a
dreadful
height
in
both
camps
for
wallenstein
had
also
received
reinforcements
from
bavaria
besides
the
men
confronted
to
each
other
and
more
than
horses
in
the
two
armies
and
besides
the
inhabitants
of
nuremberg
whose
number
far
exceeded
the
swedish
army
there
were
in
the
camp
of
wallenstein
about
women
with
as
many
drivers
and
nearly
the
same
number
in
that
of
the
swedes
the
custom
of
the
time
permitted
the
soldier
to
carry
his
family
with
him
to

field
a
number
of
prostitutes
followed
the
imperialists
while
with
the
view
of
preventing
such
excesses
gustavus
care
for
the
morals
of
his
soldiers
promoted
marriages
for
the
rising
generation
who
had
this
camp
for
their
home
and
country
regular
military
schools
were
established
which
educated
a
race
of
excellent
warriors
by
which
means
the
army
might
in
a
manner
recruit
itself
in
the
course
of
a
long
campaign
no
wonder
then
if
these
wandering
nations
exhausted
every
territory
in
which
they
encamped
and
by
their
immense
consumption
raised
the
necessaries
of
life
to
an
exorbitant
price
all
the
mills
of
nuremberg
were
insufficient
to
grind
the
corn
required
for
each
day
and
pounds
of
bread
which
were
daily
delivered
by
the
town
into
the
swedish
camp
excited
without
allaying
the
hunger
of
the
soldiers
the
laudable
exertions
of
the
magistrates
of
nuremberg
could
not
prevent
the
greater
part
of
the
horses
from
dying
for
want
of
forage
while
the
increasing
mortality
in
the
camp
consigned
more
than
a
hundred
men
daily
to
the
grave
to
put
an
end
to
these
distresses
gustavus
adolphus
relying
on
his
numerical
superiority
left
his
lines
on
the
day
forming
before
the
enemy
in
order
of
battle
while
he
cannonaded
the
duke
camp
from
three
batteries
erected
on
the
side
of
the
rednitz
but
the
duke
remained
immoveable
in
his
entrenchments
and
contented
himself
with
answering
this
challenge
by
a
distant
fire
of
cannon
and
musketry
his
plan
was
to
wear
out
the
king
by
his
inactivity
and
by
the
force
of
famine
to
overcome
his
resolute
determination
and
neither
the
remonstrances
of
maximilian
and
the
impatience
of
his
army
nor
the
ridicule
of
his
opponent
could
shake
his
purpose
gustavus
deceived
in
his
hope
of
forcing
a
battle
and
compelled
by
his
increasing
necessities
now
attempted
impossibilities
and
resolved
to
storm
a
position
which
art
and
nature
had
combined
to
render
impregnable
intrusting
his
own
camp
to
the
militia
of
nuremberg
on
the
day
of
his
encampment
the
festival
of
bartholomew
he
advanced
in
full
order
of
battle
and
passing
the
rednitz
at
furth
easily
drove
the
enemy
outposts
before
him
the
main
army
of
the
imperialists
was
posted
on
the
steep
heights
between
the
biber
and
the
rednitz
called
the
old
fortress
and
altenberg
while
the
camp
itself
commanded
by
these
eminences
spread
out
immeasurably
along
the
plain
on
these
heights
the
whole
of
the
artillery
was
placed
deep
trenches
surrounded
inaccessible
redoubts
while
thick
barricadoes
with
pointed
palisades
defended
the
approaches
to
the
heights
from
the
summits
of
which
wallenstein
calmly
and
securely
discharged
the
lightnings
of
his
artillery
from
amid
the
dark
of
smoke
a
destructive
fire
of
musketry
was
maintained
behind
the
breastworks
and
a
hundred
pieces
of
cannon
threatened
the
desperate
assailant
with
certain
destruction
against
this
dangerous
post
gustavus
now
directed
his
attack
five
hundred
musketeers
supported
by
a
few
infantry
for
a
greater
number

in
the
narrow
space

the
unenvied
privilege
of

throwing
themselves
into

was
furious
the
resistance
obstinate
exposed
to
the
whole
fire
of
the
enemy
artillery
and
infuriate
by
the
prospect
of
inevitable
death
these
determined
warriors
rushed
forward
to
storm
the
heights
which
in
an
instant
converted
into
a
flaming
volcano
discharged
on
them
a
shower
of
shot
at
the
same
moment
the
heavy
cavalry
rushed
forward
into
the
openings
which
the
artillery
had
made
in
the
close
ranks
of
the
assailants
and
divided
them
till
the
intrepid
band
conquered
by
the
strength
of
nature
and
of
man
took
to
flight
leaving
a
hundred
dead
upon
the
field
to
germans
had
gustavus
yielded
this
post
of
honour
exasperated
at
their
retreat
he
now
led
on
his
finlanders
to
the
attack
thinking
by
their
northern
courage
to
shame
the
cowardice
of
the
germans
but
they
also
after
a
similar
hot
reception
yielded
to
the
superiority
of
the
enemy
and
a
third
regiment
succeeded
them
to
experience
the
same
fate
this
was
replaced
by
a
fourth
a
fifth
and
a
sixth
so
that
during
a
ten
hours
action
every
regiment
was
brought
to
the
attack
to
retire
with
bloody
loss
from
the
contest
a
thousand
mangled
bodies
covered
the
field
yet
gustavus
undauntedly
maintained
the
attack
and
wallenstein
held
his
position
unshaken
in
the
mean
time
a
sharp
contest
had
taken
place
between
the
imperial
cavalry
and
the
left
wing
of
the
swedes
which
was
posted
in
a
thicket
on
the
rednitz
with
varying
success
but
with
equal
intrepidity
and
loss
on
both
sides
the
duke
of
friedland
and
prince
bernard
of
weimar
had
each
a
horse
shot
under
them
the
king
himself
had
the
sole
of
his
boot
carried
off
by
a
cannon
ball
the
combat
was
maintained
with
undiminished
obstinacy
till
the
approach
of
night
separated
the
combatants
but
the
swedes
had
advanced
too
far
to
retreat
without
hazard
while
the
king
was
seeking
an
officer
to
convey
to
the
regiments
the
order
to
retreat
he
met
colonel
hepburn
a
brave
scotchman
whose
native
courage
alone
had
drawn
him
from
the
camp
to
share
in
the
dangers
of
the
day
offended
with
the
king
for
having
not
long
before
preferred
a
younger
officer
for
some
post
of
danger
he
had
rashly
vowed
never
again
to
draw
his
sword
for
the
king
to
him
gustavus
now
addressed
himself
praising
his
courage
and
requesting
him
to
order
the
regiments
to
retreat
sire
replied
the
brave
soldier
it
is
the
only
service
i
can
not
refuse
to
your
majesty
for
it
is
a
hazardous
one
and
immediately
hastened
to
carry
the
command
one
of
the
heights
above
the
old
fortress

in
the
heat
of
the
action
been
carried
by
the
duke
of
weimar
it
commanded
the
hills
and
the
whole
camp
but
the
heavy
rain
which
fell
during
the
night
rendered
it
impossible
to
draw
up
the
cannon
and
this
post
which
had
been
gained
with
so
much
bloodshed
was
also
voluntarily
abandoned
diffident
of
fortune
which
forsook
him
on
this
decisive
day
the
king
did
not
venture
the
following
morning
to
renew
the
attack
with
his
exhausted
troops
and
vanquished
for
the
first
time
even
because
he
was
not
victor
he
led
back
his
troops
over
the
rednitz
two
thousand
dead
which
he
left
behind
him
on
the
field
testified
to
the
extent
of
his
loss
and
the
duke
of
friedland
remained
unconquered
within
his
lines
for
fourteen
days
after
this
action
the
two
armies
still
continued

each
other

hope
that
the

the
wildest
outrages

the
increasing
distress
broke
up
all

in

distinguished
themselves
for
the

they
practised

the

nuremberg
had
exerted
itself
almost
beyond
its
power
to
subsist
for
eleven
weeks
the
vast
crowd
which
was
compressed
within
its
boundaries
but
its
means
were
at

exhausted
and
the

more
numerous
party
was
obliged
to
determine
on
a
retreat
by
the
casualties
of
war
and
sickness
nuremberg
had
lost
more
than
of
its
inhabitants
and
gustavus
adolphus
nearly
of
his
soldiers
the
fields
around
the
city
were
trampled
down
the
villages
lay
in
ashes
the
plundered
peasantry
lay
faint
and
dying
on
the
highways
foul
odours
infected
the
air
and

the
exhalations
from
so
dense
a

many
putrifying

together
with
the
heat
of

a
desolating
pestilence
which
raged
among
men
and
beasts
and
long
after
the
retreat
of
both
armies
continued
to
load
the
country
with
misery
and
distress
affected
by
the
general
distress
and
despairing
of
conquering
the
steady
determination
of
the
duke
of
friedland
the
king
broke
up
his
camp
on
the
september
leaving
in
nuremberg
a
sufficient
garrison
he
advanced
in
full
order
of
battle
before
the
enemy
who
remained
motionless
and
did
not
attempt
in
the
least
to
harass
his
retreat
his
route
lay
by
the
aisch
and
windsheim
towards
neustadt
where
he
halted
five
days
to
refresh
his
troops
and
also
to
be
near
to
nuremberg
in
case
the
enemy
should
make
an
attempt
upon
the
town
but
wallenstein
as
exhausted
as
himself
had
only
awaited
the
retreat
of
the
swedes
to
commence
his
own
five
days
afterwards
he
broke
up
his
camp
at
zirndorf
and
set
it
on
fire
a
hundred
columns
of
smoke
rising
from
all
the
burning
villages
in

announced
his
retreat
and
showed
the
city
the
fate
it
had
escaped
his
march
which
was
directed
on
forchheim
was
marked
by
the
most
frightful
ravages
but
he
was
too
far
advanced
to
be
overtaken
by
the
king
the
latter
now
divided
his
army
which
the
exhausted
country
was
unable
to
support
and
leaving
one
division
to
protect
franconia
with
the
other
he
prosecuted
in
person
his
conquests
in
bavaria
in
the
mean
time
the
imperial
bavarian
army
had
marched
into
the
bishopric
of
bamberg
where
the
duke
of
friedland
a
second
time
mustered
his
troops
he
found
this
force

so
lately
had
amounted
to

diminished

to
about

thus

without

the

by
this
diversion

was
again
left
at
full
liberty
to
make
bavaria
the
seat
of
war
indifferent
towards
the
fate
of
that
country
and
weary
of
the
restraint
which
his
union
with
the
elector
imposed
upon
him
the
duke
of
friedland
eagerly
seized
the
opportunity
of
separating
from
this
burdensome
associate
and
prosecuting
with
renewed
earnestness
his
favourite
plans
still
adhering
to
his
purpose
of
detaching
saxony
from
its
swedish
alliance
he
selected
that
country
for
his
winter
quarters
hoping
by
his
destructive
presence
to
force
the
elector
the
more
readily
into
his
views
no
conjuncture
could
be
more
favourable
for
his
designs
the
saxons
had
invaded
silesia
where
reinforced
by
troops
from
brandenburgh
and
sweden
they
had
gained
several
advantages
over
the
emperor
troops
silesia
would
be
saved
by
a
diversion
against
the
elector
in
his
own
territories
and
the
attempt
was
the
more
easy
as
saxony
left
undefended
during
the
war
in
silesia
lay
open
on
every
side
to
attack
the
pretext
of
rescuing
from
the
enemy
an
hereditary
dominion
of
austria
would
silence
the
remonstrances
of
the
elector
of
bavaria
and
under
the
mask
of
a
patriotic
zeal
for
the
emperor
interests
maximilian
might
be
sacrificed
without
much
difficulty
by
giving
up
the
rich
country
of
bavaria
to
the
swedes
he
hoped
to
be
left
unmolested
by
them
in
his
enterprise
against
saxony
while
the
increasing
coldness
between
gustavus
and
the
saxon
court
gave
him
little
reason
to
apprehend
any
extraordinary
zeal
for
the
deliverance
of
john
george
thus
a
second
time
abandoned
by
his
artful
protector
the
elector
separated
from
wallenstein
at
bamberg
to
protect
his
defenceless
territory
with
the
small
remains
of
his
troops
while
the
imperial
army
under
wallenstein
directed
its
march
through
bayreuth
and
coburg
towards
the
thuringian
forest
an
imperial
general
holk
had
previously
been
sent
into
vogtland
with
men
to
waste
this
defenceless
province
with
fire
and
sword
he
was
soon
followed
by
gallas
another
of
the
duke
generals
and
an
equally
faithful
instrument
of
his
inhuman
orders
finally
pappenheim
too
was
recalled
from
lower
saxony
to
reinforce
the
diminished
army
of
the
duke
and
to
complete
the
miseries
of
the
devoted
country
ruined
churches
villages
in
ashes
harvests
wilfully
destroyed
families
plundered
and
murdered
peasants
marked
the
progress
of
these
barbarians
under
whose
scourge
the
whole
of
thuringia
vogtland
and
meissen
lay
defenceless
yet
this
was
but
the
prelude
to
greater
sufferings
with
which
wallenstein
himself
at
the
head
of
the
main
army
threatened
saxony
after
having
left
behind
him
fearful
monuments
of
his
fury
in
his
march
through
franconia
and
thuringia
he
arrived
with
his
whole
army
in
the
circle
of
leipzig
and
compelled
the
city
after
a
short
resistance
to
surrender
his
design
was
to
push
on
to
dresden
and
by
the
conquest
of
the
whole
country
to
prescribe
laws
to
the
elector
he
had
already
approached
the
mulda
threatening
to
overpower
the
saxon
army
which
had
advanced
as
far
as
torgau
to
meet
him
when
the
king
of
arrival
at
erfurt
gave
an
unexpected
check
to
his
operations
placed
between
the
saxon
and
swedish
armies
which
were
likely
to
be
farther
reinforced
by
the
troops
of
george
duke
of
luneburg
from
lower
saxony
he
hastily
retired
upon
meresberg
to
form
a
junction
there
with
count
pappenheim
and
to
repel
the
further
advance
of
the
swedes
gustavus
adolphus
had
witnessed
with
great
uneasiness
the
arts
employed
by
spain
and
austria
to
detach
his
allies
from
him
the
more
important
his
alliance
with
saxony
the
more
anxiety
the
inconstant
temper
of
john
george
caused
him
between
himself
and
the
elector
a
sincere
friendship
could
never
subsist
a
prince
proud
of
his
political
importance
and
accustomed
to
consider
himself
as
the
head
of
his
party
could
not
see
without
annoyance
the
interference
of
a
foreign
power
in
the
affairs
of
the
empire
and
nothing
but
the
extreme
danger
of
his
dominions
could
overcome
the
aversion
with
which
he
had
long
witnessed
the
progress
of
this
unwelcome
intruder
the
increasing
influence
of
the
king
in
germany
his
authority
with
the
protestant
states
the
unambiguous
proofs
which
he
gave
of
his
ambitious
views
which
were
of
a
character
calculated
to
excite
the
jealousies
of
all
the
states
of
the
empire
awakened
in
the
elector
breast
a
thousand
anxieties
which
the
imperial
emissaries
did
not
fail
skilfully
to
keep
alive
and
cherish
every
arbitrary
step
on
the
part
of
the
king
every
demand
however
reasonable
which
he
addressed
to
the
princes
of
the
empire
was
followed
by
bitter
complaints
from
the
elector
which
seemed
to
announce
an
approaching
rupture
even
the
generals
of
the
two
powers
whenever
they
were
called
upon
to
act
in
common
manifested
the
same
jealousy
as
divided
their
leaders
john
george
natural
aversion
to
war
and
a
lingering
attachment
to
austria
favoured
the
efforts
of
arnheim
who
maintaining
a
constant
correspondence
with
wallenstein
laboured
incessantly
to
effect
a
private
treaty
between
his
master
and
the
emperor
and
if
his
representations
were
long
disregarded
still
the
event
proved
that
they
were
not
altogether
without
effect
gustavus
adolphus
naturally
apprehensive
of
the
consequences
which
the
defection
of
so
powerful
an
ally
would
produce
on
his
future
prospects
in
germany
spared
no
pains
to
avert
so
pernicious
an
event
and
his
remonstrances
had
hitherto
had
some
effect
upon
the
elector
but
the
formidable
power
with
which
the
emperor
seconded
his
seductive
proposals
and
the
miseries
which
in
the
case
of
hesitation
he
threatened
to
accumulate
upon
saxony
might
at
length
overcome
the
resolution
of
the
elector
should
he
be
left
exposed
to
the
vengeance
of
his
enemies
while
an
indifference
to
the
fate
of
so
powerful
a
confederate
would
irreparably
destroy
the
confidence
of
the
other
allies
in
their
protector
this
consideration
induced
the
king
a
second
time
to
yield
to
the
pressing
entreaties
of
the
elector
and
to
sacrifice
his
own
brilliant
prospects
to
the
safety
of
this
ally
he
had
already
resolved
upon
a
second
attack
on
ingoldstadt
and
the
weakness
of
the
elector
of
bavaria
gave
him
hopes
of
soon
forcing
this
exhausted
enemy
to
accede
to
a
neutrality
an
insurrection
of
the
peasantry
in
upper
austria
opened
to
him
a
passage
into
that
country
and
the
capital
might
be
in
his
possession
before
wallenstein
could
have
time
to
advance
to
its
defence
all
these
views
he
now
gave
up
for
the
sake
of
an
ally
who
neither
by
his
services
nor
his
fidelity
was
worthy
of
the
sacrifice
who
on
the
pressing
occasions
of
common
good
had
steadily
adhered
to
his
own
selfish
projects
and
who
was
important
not
for
the
services
he
was
expected
to
render
but
merely
for
the
injuries
he
had
it
in
his
power
to
inflict
is
it
possible
then
to
refrain
from
indignation
when
we
know
that
in
this
expedition
undertaken
for
the
benefit
of
such
an
ally
the
great
king
was
destined
to
terminate
his
career
rapidly
assembling
his
troops
in
franconia
he
followed
the
route
of
wallenstein
through
thuringia
duke
bernard
of
weimar
who
had
been
despatched
to
act
against
pappenheim
joined
the
king
at
armstadt
who
now
saw
himself
at
the
head
of
veterans
at
erfurt
he
took
leave
of
his
queen
who
was
not
to
behold
him
save
in
his
coffin
at
weissenfels
their
anxious
adieus
seemed
to
forbode
an
eternal
separation
he
reached
naumburg
on
the
november
before
the
corps
which
the
duke
of
friedland
had
despatched
for
that
purpose
could
make
itself
master
of
that
place
the
inhabitants
of
the
surrounding
country
flocked
in
crowds
to
look
upon
the
hero
the
avenger
the
great
king
who
a
year
before
had
first
appeared
in
that
quarter
like
a
guardian
angel
shouts
of
joy
everywhere
attended
his
progress
the
people
knelt
before
him
and
struggled
for
the
honour
of
touching
the
sheath
of
his
sword
or
the
hem
of
his
garment
the
modest
hero
disliked
this
innocent
tribute
which
a
sincerely
grateful
and
admiring
multitude
paid
him
is
it
not
said
he
as
if
this
people
would
make
a
god
of
me
our
affairs
prosper
indeed
but
i
fear
the
vengeance
of
heaven
will
punish
me
for
this
presumption
and
soon
enough
reveal
to
this
deluded
multitude
my
human
weakness
and
mortality
how
amiable
does
gustavus
appear
before
us
at
this
moment
when
about
to
leave
us
for
ever
even
in
the
plenitude
of
success
he
honours
an
avenging
nemesis
declines
that
homage
which
is
due
only
to
the
immortal
and
strengthens
his
title
to
our
tears
the
nearer
the
moment
approaches
that
is
to
call
them
forth
in
the
mean
time
the
duke
of
friedland
had
determined
to
advance
to
meet
the
king
as
far
as
weissenfels
and
even
at
the
hazard
of
a
battle
to
secure
his
in
saxony
his
inactivity
before
nuremberg
had
occasioned
a
suspicion
that
he
was
unwilling
to
measure
his
powers
with
those
of
the
hero
of
the
north
and
his
reputation
would
be
at
stake
if
a
second
time
he
should
decline
a
battle
his
present
superiority
in
numbers
though
much
less
than
what
it
was
at
the
beginning
of
the
siege
of
nuremberg
was
still
enough
to
give
him
hopes
of
victory
if
he
could
compel
the
king
to
give
battle
before
his
junction
with
the
saxons
but
his
present
reliance
was
not
so
much
in
his
numerical
superiority
as
in
the
predictions
of
his
astrologer
seni
who
had
read
in
the
stars
that
the
good
fortune
of
the
swedish
monarch
would
decline
in
the
month
of
november
besides
between
naumburg
and
weissenfels
there
was
also
a
range
of
narrow
defiles
formed
by
a
long
mountainous
ridge
and
the
river
saal
which
ran
at
their
foot
along
which
the
swedes
could
not
advance
without
difficulty
and
which
might
with
the
assistance
of
a
few
troops
be
rendered
almost
impassable
if
attacked
there
the
king
would
have
no
choice
but
either
to
penetrate
with
great
danger
through
the
defiles
or
commence
a
laborious
retreat
through
thuringia
and
to
expose
the
greater
part
of
his
army
to
a
march
through
a
desert
country
deficient
in
every
necessary
for
their
support
but
the
rapidity
with
which
gustavus
adolphus
had
taken
possession
of
naumburg
disappointed
this
plan
and
it
was
now
wallenstein
himself
who
awaited
the
attack
but
in
this
expectation
he
was
disappointed
for
the
king
instead
of
advancing
to
meet
him
at
weissenfels
made
preparations
for
entrenching
himself
near
naumburg
with
the
intention
of
awaiting
there
the
reinforcements
which
the
duke
of
lunenburg
was
bringing
up
undecided
whether
to
advance
against
the
king
through
the
narrow
passes
between
weissenfels
and
naumburg
or
to
remain
inactive
in
his
camp
he
called
a
council
of
war
in
order
to
have
the
opinion
of
his
most
experienced
generals
none
of
these
thought
it
prudent
to
attack
the
king
in
his
advantageous
position
on
the
other
hand
the
preparations
which
the
latter
made
to
fortify
his
camp
plainly
showed
that
it
was
not
his
intention
soon
to
abandon
it
but
the
approach
of
winter
rendered
it
impossible
to
prolong
the
campaign
and
by
a
continued
encampment
to
exhaust
the
strength
of
the
army
already
so
much
in
need
of
repose
all
voices
were
in
favour
of
immediately
terminating
the
campaign
and
the
more
so
as
the
important
city
of
cologne
upon
the
rhine
was
threatened
by
the
dutch
while
the
progress
of
the
enemy
in
westphalia
and
the
lower
rhine
called
for
effective
reinforcements
in
that
quarter
wallenstein
yielded
to
the
weight
of
these
arguments
and
almost
convinced
that
at
this
season
he
had
no
reason
to
apprehend
an
attack
from
the
king
he
put
his
troops
into
but
so
that
if
necessary
they
might
be
rapidly
assembled
count
pappenheim
was
despatched
with
great
part
of
the
army
to
the
assistance
of
cologne
with
orders
to
take
possession
on
his
march
of
the
fortress
of
moritzburg
in
the
territory
of
halle
different
corps
took
up
their
in
the
neighbouring
towns
to
watch
on
all
sides
the
motions
of
the
enemy
count
colloredo
guarded
the
castle
of
weissenfels
and
wallenstein
himself
encamped
with
the
remainder
not
far
from
merseburg
between
flotzgaben
and
the
saal
from
whence
he
purposed
to
march
to
leipzig
and
to
cut
off
the
communication
between
the
saxons
and
the
swedish
army
scarcely
had
gustavus
adolphus
been
informed
of
pappenheim
departure
when
suddenly
breaking
up
his
camp
at
naumburg
he
hastened
with
his
whole
force
to
attack
the
enemy
now
weakened
to
one
half
he
advanced
by
rapid
marches
towards
weissenfels
from
whence
the
news
of
his
arrival
quickly
reached
the
enemy
and
greatly
astonished
the
duke
of
friedland
but
a
speedy
resolution
was
now
necessary
and
the
measures
of
wallenstein
were
soon
taken
though
he
had
little
more
than
men
to
oppose
to
the
of
the
enemy
he
might
hope
to
maintain
his
ground
until
the
return
of
pappenheim
who
could
not
have
advanced
farther
than
halle
five
miles
distant
messengers
were
hastily
despatched
to
recall
him
while
wallenstein
moved
forward
into
the
wide
plain
between
the
canal
and
lutzen
where
he
awaited
the
king
in
full
order
of
battle
and
by
this
position
cut
off
his
communication
with
leipzig
and
the
saxon
auxiliaries
three
cannon
shots
fired
by
count
colloredo
from
the
castle
of
weissenfels
announced
the
king
approach
and
at
this
concerted
signal
the
light
troops
of
the
duke
of
friedland
under
the
command
of
the
croatian
general
isolani
moved
forward
to
possess
themselves
of
the
villages
lying
upon
the
rippach
their
weak
resistance
did
not
impede
the
advance
of
the
enemy
who
crossed
the
rippach
near
the
village
of
that
name
and
formed
in
line
below
lutzen
opposite
the
imperialists
the
high
road
which
goes
from
weissenfels
to
leipzig
is
intersected
between
lutzen
and
markranstadt
by
the
canal
which
extends
from
zeitz
to
merseburg
and
unites
the
elster
with
the
saal
on
this
canal
rested
the
left
wing
of
the
imperialists
and
the
right
of
the
king
of
sweden
but
so
that
the
cavalry
of
both
extended
themselves
along
the
opposite
side
to
the
northward
behind
lutzen
was
wallenstein
right
wing
and
to
the
south
of
that
town
was
posted
the
left
wing
of
the
swedes
both
armies
fronted
the
high
road
which
ran
between
them
and
divided
their
order
of
battle
but
the
evening
before
the
battle
wallenstein
to
the
great
disadvantage
of
his
opponent
had
possessed
himself
of
this
highway
deepened
the
trenches
which
ran
along
its
sides
and
planted
them
with
musketeers
so
as
to
make
the
crossing
of
it
both
difficult
and
dangerous
behind
these
again
was
erected
a
battery
of
seven
large
pieces
of
cannon
to
support
the
fire
from
the
trenches
and
at
the
windmills
close
behind
lutzen
fourteen
smaller
field
pieces
were
ranged
on
an
eminence
from
which
they
could
sweep
the
greater
part
of
the
plain
the
infantry
divided
into
no
more
than
five
unwieldy
brigades
was
drawn
up
at
the
distance
of
paces
from
the
road
and
the
cavalry
covered
the
flanks
all
the
baggage
was
sent
to
leipzig
that
it
might
not
impede
the
movements
of
the
army
and
the
alone
remained
which
were
placed
in
rear
of
the
line
to
conceal
the
weakness
of
the
imperialists
all
the
and
sutlers
were
mounted
and
posted
on
the
left
wing
but
only
until
pappenheim
troops
arrived
these
arrangements
were
made
during
the
darkness
of
the
night
and
when
the
morning
dawned
all
was
ready
for
the
reception
of
the
enemy
on
the
evening
of
the
same
day
gustavus
adolphus
appeared
on
the
opposite
plain
and
formed
his
troops
in
the
order
of
attack
his
disposition
was
the
same
as
that
which
had
been
so
successful
the
year
before
at
leipzig
small
squadrons
of
horse
were
interspersed
among
the
divisions
of
the
infantry
and
troops
of
musketeers
placed
here
and
there
among
the
cavalry
the
army
was
arranged
in
two
lines
the
canal

in

the

the

the

to
the

hero
bernard
duke
of

was
intrusted
the
command
of
the
german
cavalry
of
the
left
wing
while
on
the
right
the
king
led
on
the
swedes
in
person
in
order
to
excite
the
emulation
of
the
two
nations
to
a
noble
competition
the
second
line
was
formed
in
the
same
manner
and
behind
these
was
placed
the
reserve
commanded
by
henderson
a
scotchman
in
this
position
they
awaited
the
eventful
dawn
of
morning
to
begin
a
contest
which
long
delay
rather
than
the
probability
of
decisive
consequences
and
the
picked
body
rather
than
the
number
of
the
combatants
was
to
render
so
terrible
and
remarkable
the
strained
expectation
of
europe
so
disappointed
before
nuremberg
was
now
to
be
gratified
on
the
plains
of
lutzen
during
the
whole
course
of
the
war
two
such
generals
so
equally
matched
in
renown
and
ability
had
not
before
been
pitted
against
each
other
never
as
yet
had
daring
been
cooled
by
so
awful
a
hazard
or
hope
animated
by
so
glorious
a
prize
europe
was
next
day
to
learn
who
was
her
greatest
general
the
leader
who
had
hitherto
been
invincible
must
acknowledge
a
victor
this
morning
was
to
place
it
beyond
a
doubt
whether
the
victories
of
gustavus
at
leipzig
and
on
the
lech
were
owing
to
his
own
military
genius
or
to
the
incompetency
of
his
opponent
whether
the
services
of
wallenstein
were
to
vindicate
the
emperor
choice
and
justify
the
high
price
at
which
they
had
been
purchased
the
victory
was
as
yet
doubtful
but
certain
were
the
labour
and
the
bloodshed
by
which
it
must
be
earned
every
private
in
both
armies
felt
a
jealous
share
in
their
leader
reputation
and
under
every
corslet
beat
the
same
emotions
that
inflamed
the
bosoms
of
the
generals
each
army
knew
the
enemy
to
which
it
was
to
be
opposed
and
the
anxiety
which
each
in
vain
attempted
to
repress
was
a
convincing
proof
of
their
opponent
strength
at
last
the
fateful
morning
dawned
but
an
impenetrable
fog
which
spread
over
the
plain
delayed
the
attack
till
noon
kneeling
in
front
of
his
lines
the
king
offered
up
his
devotions
and
the
whole
army
at
the
same
moment
dropping
on
their
knees
burst
into
a
moving
hymn
accompanied
by
the
military
music
the
king
then
mounted
his
horse
and
clad
only
in
a
leathern
doublet
and
surtout
for
a
wound
he
had
formerly
received
prevented
his
wearing
armour
rode
along
the
ranks
to
animate
the
courage
of
his
troops
with
a
joyful
confidence
which
however
the
forboding
presentiment
of
his
own
bosom
contradicted
god
with
us
was
the
of
the
swedes
jesus
maria
that
of
the
imperialists
about
eleven
the
fog
began
to
disperse
and
the
enemy
became
visible
at
the
same
moment
lutzen
was
seen
in
flames
having
been
set
on
fire
by
command
of
the
duke
to
prevent
his
being
outflanked
on
that
side
the
charge
was
now
sounded
the
cavalry
rushed
upon
the
enemy
and
the
infantry
advanced
against
the
trenches
received
by
a
tremendous
fire
of
musketry
and
heavy
artillery
these
intrepid
battalions
maintained
the
attack
with
undaunted
courage
till
the
enemy
musketeers
abandoned
their
posts
the
trenches
were
passed
the
battery
carried
and
turned
against
the
enemy
they
pressed
forward
with
irresistible
impetuosity
the
first
of
the
five
imperial
brigades
was
immediately
routed
the
second
soon
after
and
the
third
put
to
flight
but
here
the
genius
of
wallenstein
opposed
itself
to
their
progress
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
he
was
on
the
spot
to
rally
his
discomfited
troops
and
his
powerful
word
was
itself
sufficient
to
stop
the
flight
of
the
fugitives
supported
by
three
regiments
of
cavalry
the
vanquished
brigades
forming
anew
faced
the
enemy
and
pressed
vigorously
into
the
broken
ranks
of
the
swedes
a
murderous
conflict
ensued
the
nearness
of
the
enemy
left
no
room
for
the
fury
of
the
attack
no
time
for
loading
man
was
matched
to
man
the
useless
musket
exchanged
for
the
sword
and
pike
and
science
gave
way
to
desperation
overpowered
by
numbers
the
wearied
swedes
at
last
retire
beyond
the
trenches
and
the
captured
battery
is
again
lost
by
the
retreat
a
thousand
mangled
bodies
already
strewed
the
plain
and
as
yet
not
a
single
step
of
ground
had
been
won
in
the
mean
time
the
king
right
wing
led
by
himself
had
fallen
upon
the
enemy
left
the
first
impetuous
shock
of
the
heavy
finland
cuirassiers
dispersed
the
poles
and
croats
who
were
posted
here
and
their
disorderly
flight
spread
terror
and
confusion
among
the
rest
of
the
cavalry
at
this
moment
notice
was
brought
the
king
that
his
infantry
were
retreating
over
the
trenches
and
also
that
his
left
wing
exposed
to
a
severe
fire
from
the
enemy
cannon
posted
at
the
windmills
was
beginning
to
give
way
with
rapid
decision
he
committed
to
general
horn
the
pursuit
of
the
enemy
left
while
he
flew
at
the
head
of
the
regiment
of
steinbock
to
repair
the
disorder
of
his
right
wing
his
noble
charger
bore
him
with
the
velocity
of
lightning
across
the
trenches
but
the
squadrons
that
followed
could
not
come
on
with
the
same
speed
and
only
a
few
horsemen
among
whom
was
francis
albert
duke
of
saxe
lauenburg
were
able
to
keep
up
with
the
king
he
rode
directly
to
the
place
where
his
infantry
were
most
closely
pressed
and
while
he
was
reconnoitring
the
enemy
line
for
an
exposed
point
of
attack
the
shortness
of
his
sight
unfortunately
led
him
too
close
to
their
ranks
an
imperial
remarking
that
every
one
respectfully
made
way
for
him
as
he
rode
along
immediately
ordered
a
musketeer
to
take
aim
at
him
fire
at
him
yonder
said
he
that
must
be
a
man
of
consequence
the
soldier
fired
and
the
king
left
arm
was
shattered
at
that
moment
his
squadron
came
hurrying
up
and
a
confused
cry
of
the
king
bleeds
the
king
is
shot
spread
terror
and
consternation
through
all
the
ranks
it
is
nothing
follow
me
cried
the
king
collecting
his
whole
strength
but
overcome
by
pain
and
nearly
fainting
he
requested
the
duke
of
lauenburg
in
french
to
lead
him
unobserved
out
of
the
tumult
while
the
duke
proceeded
towards
the
right
wing
with
the
king
making
a
long
circuit
to
keep
this
discouraging
sight
from
the
disordered
infantry
his
majesty
received
a
second
shot
through
the
back
which
deprived
him
of
his
remaining
strength
brother
said
he
with
a
dying
voice
i
have
enough
look
only
to
your
own
life
at
the
same
moment
he
fell
from
his
horse
pierced
by
several
more
shots
and
abandoned
by
all
his
attendants
he
breathed
his
last
amidst
the
plundering
hands
of
the
croats
his
charger
flying
without
its
rider
and
covered
with
blood
soon
made
known
to
the
swedish
cavalry
the
fall
of
their
king
they
rushed
madly
forward
to
rescue
his
sacred
remains
from
the
hands
of
the
enemy
a
murderous
conflict
ensued
over
the
body
till
his
mangled
remains
were
buried
beneath
a
heap
of
slain
gefreyter
a
person
exempt
from
watching
duty
nearly
corresponding
to
the
corporal
the
mournful
tidings
soon
ran
through
the
swedish
army
but
instead
of
destroying
the
courage
of
these
brave
troops
it
but
excited
it
into
a
new
a
wild
and
consuming
flame
life
had
lessened
in
value
now
that
the
most
sacred
life
of
all
was
gone
death
had
no
terrors
for
the
lowly
since
the
anointed
head
was
not
spared
with
the
fury
of
lions
the
upland
smaeland
finland
east
and
west
gothland
regiments
rushed
a
second
time
upon
the
left
wing
of
the
enemy
which
already
making
but
feeble
resistance
to
general
horn
was
now
entirely
beaten
from
the
field
bernard
duke
of
gave
to
the
bereaved
swedes
a
noble
leader
in
his
own
person
and
the
spirit
of
gustavus
led
his
victorious
squadrons
anew
the
left
wing
quickly
formed
again
and
vigorously
pressed
the
right
of
the
imperialists
the
artillery
at
the
windmills
which
had
maintained
so
murderous
a
fire
upon
the
swedes
was
captured
and
turned
against
the
enemy
the
centre
also
of
the
swedish
infantry
commanded
by
the
duke
and
knyphausen
advanced
a
second
time
against
the
trenches
which
they
successfully
passed
and
retook
the
battery
of
seven
cannons
the
attack
was
now
renewed
with
redoubled
fury
upon
the
heavy
battalions
of
the
enemy
centre
their
resistance
became
gradually
less
and
chance
conspired
with
swedish
valour
to
complete
the
defeat
the
imperial
took
fire
and
with
a
tremendous
explosion
grenades
and
bombs
filled
the
air
the
enemy
now
in
confusion
thought
they
were
attacked
in
the
rear
while
the
swedish
brigades
pressed
them
in
front
their
courage
began
to
fail
them
their
left
wing
was
already
beaten
their
right
wavering
and
their
artillery
in
the
enemy
hands
the
battle
seemed
to
be
almost
decided
another
moment
would
decide
the
fate
of
the
day
when
pappenheim
appeared
on
the
field
with
his
cuirassiers
and
dragoons
all
the
advantages
already
gained
were
lost
and
the
battle
was
to
be
fought
anew
the
order
which
recalled
that
general
to
lutzen
had
reached
him
in
halle
while
his
troops
were
still
plundering
the
town
it
was
impossible
to
collect
the
scattered
infantry
with
that
rapidity
which
the
urgency
of
the
order
and
pappenheim
impatience
required
without
waiting
for
it
therefore
he
ordered
eight
regiments
of
cavalry
to
mount
and
at
their
head
he
galloped
at
full
speed
for
lutzen
to
share
in
the
battle
he
arrived
in
time
to
witness
the
flight
of
the
imperial
right
wing
which
gustavus
horn
was
driving
from
the
field
and
to
be
at
first
involved
in
their
rout
but
with
rapid
presence
of
mind
he
rallied
the
flying
troops
and
led
them
once
more
against
the
enemy
carried
away
by
his
wild
bravery
and
impatient
to
encounter
the
king
who
he
supposed
was
at
the
head
of
this
wing
he
burst
furiously
upon
the
swedish
ranks
which
exhausted
by
victory
and
inferior
in
numbers
were
after
a
noble
resistance
overpowered
by
this
fresh
body
of
enemies
pappenheim
unexpected
appearance
revived
the
drooping
courage
of
the
imperialists
and
the
duke
of
friedland
quickly
availed
himself
of
the
favourable
moment
to
his
line
the
closely
serried
battalions
of
the
swedes
were
after
a
tremendous
conflict
again
driven
across
the
trenches
and
the
battery
which
had
been
twice
lost
again
rescued
from
their
hands
the
whole
yellow
regiment
the
finest
of
all
that
distinguished
themselves
in
this
dreadful
day
lay
dead
on
the
field
covering
the
ground
almost
in
the
same
excellent
order
which
when
alive
they
maintained
with
such
unyielding
courage
the
same
fate
befel
another
regiment
of
blues
which
count
piccolomini
attacked
with
the
imperial
cavalry
and
cut
down
after
a
desperate
contest
seven
times
did
this
intrepid
general
renew
the
attack
seven
horses
were
shot
under
him
and
he
himself
was
pierced
with
six
musket
balls
yet
he
would
not
leave
the
field
until
he
was
carried
along
in
the
general
rout
of
the
whole
army
wallenstein
himself
was
seen
riding
through
his
ranks
with
cool
intrepidity
amidst
a
shower
of
balls
assisting
the
distressed
encouraging
the
valiant
with
praise
and
the
wavering
by
his
fearful
glance
around
and
close
by
him
his
men
were
falling
thick
and
his
own
mantle
was
perforated
by
several
shots
but
avenging
destiny
this
day
protected
that
breast
for
which
another
weapon
was
reserved
on
the
same
field
where
the
noble
gustavus
expired
wallenstein
was
not
allowed
to
terminate
his
guilty
career
less
fortunate
was
pappenheim
the
telamon
of
the
army
the
bravest
soldier
of
austria
and
the
church
an
ardent
desire
to
encounter
the
king
in
person
carried
this
daring
leader
into
the
thickest
of
the
fight
where
he
thought
his
noble
opponent
was
most
surely
to
be
met
gustavus
had
also
expressed
a
wish
to
meet
his
brave
antagonist
but
these
hostile
wishes
remained
ungratified
death
first
brought
together
these
two
great
heroes
two
pierced
the
breast
of
pappenheim
and
his
men
forcibly
carried
him
from
the
field
while
they
were
conveying
him
to
the
rear
a
murmur
reached
him
that
he
whom
he
had
sought
lay
dead
upon
the
plain
when
the
truth
of
the
report
was
confirmed
to
him
his
look
became
brighter
his
dying
eye
sparkled
with
a
last
gleam
of
joy
tell
the
duke
of
friedland
said
he
that
i
lie
without
hope
of
life
but
that
i
die
happy
since
i
know
that
the
implacable
enemy
of
my
religion
has
fallen
on
the
same
day
with
pappenheim
the
good
fortune
of
the
imperialists
departed
the
cavalry
of
the
left
wing
already
beaten
and
only
rallied
by
his
exertions
no
sooner
missed
their
victorious
leader
than
they
gave
up
everything
for
lost
and
abandoned
the
field
of
battle
in
spiritless
despair
the
right
wing
fell
into
the
same
confusion
with
the
exception
of
a
few
regiments
which
the
bravery
of
their
colonels
gotz
terzky
colloredo
and
piccolomini
compelled
to
keep
their
ground
the
swedish
infantry
with
prompt
determination
profited
by
the
enemy
confusion
to
fill
up
the
gaps
which
death
had
made
in
the
front
line
they
formed
both
lines
into
one
and
with
it
made
the
final
and
decisive
charge
a
third
time
they
crossed
the
trenches
and
a
third
time
they
captured
the
battery
the
sun
was
setting
when
the
two
lines
closed
the
strife
grew
hotter
as
it
drew
to
an
end
the
last
efforts
of
strength
were
mutually
exerted
and
skill
and
courage
did
their
utmost
to
repair
in
these
precious
moments
the
fortune
of
the
day
it
was
in
vain
despair
endows
every
one
with
superhuman
strength
no
one
can
conquer
no
one
will
give
way
the
art
of
war
seemed
to
exhaust
its
powers
on
one
side
only
to
unfold
some
new
and
untried
masterpiece
of
skill
on
the
other
night
and
darkness
at
last
put
an
end
to
the
fight
before
the
fury
of
the
combatants
was
exhausted
and
the
contest
only
ceased
when
no
one
could
any
longer
find
an
antagonist
both
armies
separated
as
if
by
tacit
agreement
the
trumpets
sounded
and
each
party
claiming
the
victory
quitted
the
field
the
artillery
on
both
sides
as
the
horses
could
not
be
found
remained
all
night
upon
the
field
at
once
the
reward
and
the
evidence
of
victory
to
him
who
should
hold
it
wallenstein
in
his
haste
to
leave
leipzig
and
saxony
forgot
to
remove
his
part
not
long
after
the
battle
was
ended
pappenheim
infantry
who
had
been
unable
to
follow
the
rapid
movements
of
their
general
and
who
amounted
to
six
regiments
marched
on
the
field
but
the
work
was
done
a
few
hours
earlier
so
considerable
a
reinforcement
would
perhaps
have
decided
the
day
in
favour
of
the
imperialists
and
even
now
by
remaining
on
the
field
they
might
have
saved
the
duke
artillery
and
made
a
prize
of
that
of
the
swedes
but
they
had
received
no
orders
to
act
and
uncertain
as
to
the
issue
of
the
battle
they
retired
to
leipzig
where
they
hoped
to
join
the
main
body
the
duke
of
friedland
had
retreated
thither
and
was
followed
on
the
morrow
by
the
scattered
remains
of
his
army
without
artillery
without
colours
and
almost
without
arms
the
duke
of
weimar
it
appears
after
the
toils
of
this
bloody
day
allowed
the
swedish
army
some
repose
between
lutzen
and
weissenfels
near
enough
to
the
field
of
battle
to
oppose
any
attempt
the
enemy
might
make
to
recover
it
of
the
two
armies
more
than
men
lay
dead
a
still
greater
number
were
wounded
and
among
the
imperialists
scarcely
a
man
escaped
from
the
field
uninjured
the
entire
plain
from
lutzen
to
the
canal
was
strewed
with
the
wounded
the
dying
and
the
dead

pappenheim
died
the
next
day
of
his
wounds
at
leipzig
an
irreparable
loss
to
the
imperial
army
which
this
brave
warrior
had
so
often
led
on
to
victory
the
battle
of
prague
where
together
with
wallenstein
he
was
present
as
colonel
was
the
beginning
of
his
heroic
career
dangerously
wounded
with
a
few
troops
he
made
an
impetuous
attack
on
a
regiment
of
the
enemy
and
lay
for
several
hours
mixed
with
the
dead
upon
the
field
beneath
the
weight
of
his
horse
till
he
was
discovered
by
some
of
his
own
men
in
plundering
with
a
small
force
he
defeated
in
three
different
engagements
the
rebels
in
upper
austria
though
strong
at
the
battle
of
leipzig
he
for
a
long
time
delayed
the
defeat
of
tilly
by
his
bravery
and
led
the
arms
of
the
emperor
on
the
elbe
and
the
weser
to
victory
the
wild
impetuous
fire
of
his
temperament
which
no
danger
however
apparent
could
cool
or
impossibilities
check
made
him
the
most
powerful
arm
of
the
imperial
force
but
unfitted
him
for
acting
at
its
head
the
battle
of
leipzig
if
tilly
may
be
believed
was
lost
through
his
rash
ardour
at
the
destruction
of
magdeburg
his
hands
were
deeply
steeped
in
blood
war
rendered
savage
and
ferocious
his
disposition
which
had
been
cultivated
by
youthful
studies
and
various
travels
on
his
forehead
two
red
streaks
like
swords
were
perceptible
with
which
nature
had
marked
him
at
his
very
birth
even
in
his
later
years
these
became
visible
as
often
as
his
blood
was
stirred
by
passion
and
superstition
easily
persuaded
itself
that
the
future
destiny
of
the
man
was
thus
impressed
upon
the
forehead
of
the
child
as
a
faithful
servant
of
the
house
of
austria
he
had
the
strongest
claims
on
the
gratitude
of
both
its
lines
but
he
did
not
survive
to
enjoy
the
most
brilliant
proof
of
their
regard
a
messenger
was
already
on
his
way
from
madrid
bearing
to
him
the
order
of
the
golden
fleece
when
death
overtook
him
at
leipzig
though
te
deum
in
all
spanish
and
austrian
lands
was
sung
in
honour
of
a
victory
wallenstein
himself
by
the
haste
with
which
he
quitted
leipzig
and
soon
after
all
saxony
and
by
renouncing
his
original
design
of
fixing
there
his
winter
quarters
openly
confessed
his
defeat
it
is
true
he
made
one
more
feeble
attempt
to
dispute
even
in
his
flight
the
honour
of
victory
by
sending
out
his
croats
next
morning
to
the
field
but
the
sight
of
the
swedish
army
drawn
up
in
order
of
battle
immediately
dispersed
these
flying
bands
and
duke
bernard
by
keeping
possession
of
the
field
and
soon
after
by
the
capture
of
leipzig
maintained
indisputably
his
claim
to
the
title
of
victor
but
it
was
a
dear
conquest
a
dearer
triumph
it
was
not
till
the
fury
of
the
contest
was
over
that
the
full
weight
of
the
loss
sustained
was
felt
and
the
shout
of
triumph
died
away
into
a
silent
gloom
of
despair
he
who
had
led
them
to
the
charge
returned
not
with
them
there
he
lay
upon
the
field
which
he
had
won
mingled
with
the
dead
bodies
of
the
common
crowd
after
a
long
and
almost
fruitless
search
the
corpse
of
the
king
was
discovered
not
far
from
the
great
stone
which
for
a
hundred
years
before
had
stood
between
lutzen
and
the
canal
and
which
from
the
memorable
disaster
of
that
day
still
bears
the
name
of
the
stone
of
the
swede
covered
with
blood
and
wounds
so
as
scarcely
to
be
recognised
trampled
beneath
the
horses
hoofs
stripped
by
the
rude
hands
of
plunderers
of
its
ornaments
and
clothes
his
body
was
drawn
from
beneath
a
heap
of
dead
conveyed
to
weissenfels
and
there
delivered
up
to
the
lamentations
of
his
soldiers
and
the
last
embraces
of
his
queen
the
first
tribute
had
been
paid
to
revenge
and
blood
had
atoned
for
the
blood
of
the
monarch
but
now
affection
assumes
its
rights
and
tears
of
grief
must
flow
for
the
man
the
universal
sorrow
absorbs
all
individual
woes
the
generals
still
stupefied
by
the
unexpected
blow
stood
speechless
and
motionless
around
his
bier
and
no
one
trusted
himself
enough
to
contemplate
the
full
extent
of
their
loss
the
emperor
we
are
told
by
khevenhuller
showed
symptoms
of
deep
and
apparently
sincere
feeling
at
the
sight
of
the
king
doublet
stained
with
blood
which
had
been
stripped
from
him
during
the
battle
and
carried
to
vienna
willingly
said
he
would
i
have
granted
to
the
unfortunate
prince
a
longer
life
and
a
safe
return
to
his
kingdom
had
germany
been
at
peace
but
when
a
trait
which
is
nothing
more
than
a
proof
of
a
yet
lingering
humanity
and
which
a
mere
regard
to
appearances
and
even
would
have
extorted
from
the
most
insensible
and
the
absence
of
which
could
exist
only
in
the
most
inhuman
heart
has
by
a
roman
catholic
writer
of
modern
times
and
acknowledged
merit
been
made
the
subject
of
the
highest
eulogium
and
compared
with
the
magnanimous
tears
of
alexander
for
the
fall
of
darius
our
distrust
is
excited
of
the
other
virtues
of
the
writer
hero
and
what
is
still
worse
of
his
own
ideas
of
moral
dignity
but
even
such
praise
whatever
its
amount
is
much
for
one
whose
memory
his
biographer
has
to
clear
from
the
suspicion
of
being
privy
to
the
assassination
of
a
king
it
was
scarcely
to
be
expected
that
the
strong
leaning
of
mankind
to
the
marvellous
would
leave
to
the
common
course
of
nature
the
glory
of
ending
the
career
of
gustavus
adolphus
the
death
of
so
formidable
a
rival
was
too
important
an
event
for
the
emperor
not
to
excite
in
his
bitter
opponent
a
ready
suspicion
that
what
was
so
much
to
his
interests
was
also
the
result
of
his
instigation
for
the
execution
however
of
this
dark
deed
the
emperor
would
require
the
aid
of
a
foreign
arm
and
this
it
was
generally
believed
he
had
found
in
francis
albert
duke
of
saxe
lauenburg
the
rank
of
the
latter
permitted
him
a
free
access
to
the
king
person
while
it
at
the
same
time
seemed
to
place
him
above
the
suspicion
of
so
foul
a
deed
this
prince
however
was
in
fact
not
incapable
of
this
atrocity
and
he
had
moreover
sufficient
motives
for
its
commission
francis
albert
the
youngest
of
four
sons
of
francis
ii
duke
of
lauenburg
and
related
by
the
mother
side
to
the
race
of
vasa
had
in
his
early
years
found
a
most
friendly
reception
at
the
swedish
court
some
offence
which
he
had
committed
against
gustavus
adolphus
in
the
queen
chamber
was
it
is
said
repaid
by
this
fiery
youth
with
a
box
on
the
ear
which
though
immediately
repented
of
and
amply
apologized
for
laid
the
foundation
of
an
irreconcileable
hate
in
the
vindictive
heart
of
the
duke
francis
albert
subsequently
entered
the
imperial
service
where
he
rose
to
the
command
of
a
regiment
and
formed
a
close
intimacy
with
wallenstein
and
condescended
to
be
the
instrument
of
a
secret
negociation
with
the
saxon
court
which
did
little
honour
to
his
rank
without
any
sufficient
cause
being
assigned
he
suddenly
quitted
the
austrian
service
and
appeared
in
the
king
camp
at
nuremberg
to
offer
his
services
as
a
volunteer
by
his
show
of
zeal
for
the
protestant
cause
and
prepossessing
and
flattering
deportment
he
gained
the
heart
of
the
king
who
warned
in
vain
by
oxenstiern
continued
to
lavish
his
favour
and
friendship
on
this
suspicious
new
comer
the
battle
of
lutzen
soon
followed
in
which
francis
albert
like
an
evil
genius
kept
close
to
the
king
side
and
did
not
leave
him
till
he
fell
he
owed
it
was
thought
his
own
safety
amidst
the
fire
of
the
enemy
to
a
green
sash
which
he
wore
the
colour
of
the
imperialists
he
was
at
any
rate
the
first
to
convey
to
his
friend
wallenstein
the
intelligence
of
the
king
death
after
the
battle
he
exchanged
the
swedish
service
for
the
saxon
and
after
the
murder
of
wallenstein
being
charged
with
being
an
accomplice
of
that
general
he
only
escaped
the
sword
of
justice
by
abjuring
his
faith
his
last
appearance
in
life
was
as
commander
of
an
imperial
army
in
silesia
where
he
died
of
the
wounds
he
had
received
before
schweidnitz
it
requires
some
effort
to
believe
in
the
innocence
of
a
man
who
had
run
through
a
career
like
this
of
the
act
charged
against
him
but
however
great
may
be
the
moral
and
physical
possibility
of
his
committing
such
a
crime
it
must
still
be
allowed
that
there
are
no
certain
grounds
for
imputing
it
to
him
gustavus
adolphus
it
is
well
known
exposed
himself
to
danger
like
the
meanest
soldier
in
his
army
and
where
thousands
fell
he
too
might
naturally
meet
his
death
how
it
reached
him
remains
indeed
buried
in
mystery
but
here
more
than
anywhere
does
the
maxim
apply
that
where
the
ordinary
course
of
things
is
fully
sufficient
to
account
for
the
fact
the
honour
of
human
nature
ought
not
to
be
stained
by
any
suspicion
of
moral
atrocity
but
by
whatever
hand
he
fell
his
extraordinary
destiny
must
appear
a
great
interposition
of
providence
history
too
often
confined
to
the
ungrateful
task
of
analyzing
the
uniform
play
of
human
passions
is
occasionally
rewarded
by
the
appearance
of
events
which
strike
like
a
hand
from
heaven
into
the
nicely
adjusted
machinery
of
human
plans
and
carry
the
contemplative
mind
to
a
higher
order
of
things
of
this
kind
is
the
sudden
retirement
of
gustavus
adolphus
from
the
scene
stopping
for
a
time
the
whole
movement
of
the
political
machine
and
disappointing
all
the
calculations
of
human
prudence
yesterday
the
very
soul
the
great
and
animating
principle
of
his
own
creation
struck
unpitiably
to
the
ground
in
the
very
midst
of
his
eagle
flight
untimely
torn
from
a
whole
world
of
great
designs
and
from
the
ripening
harvest
of
his
expectations
he
left
his
bereaved
party
disconsolate
and
the
proud
edifice
of
his
past
greatness
sunk
into
ruins
the
protestant
party
had
identified
its
hopes
with
its
invincible
leader
and
scarcely
can
it
now
separate
them
from
him
with
him
they
now
fear
all
good
fortune
is
buried
but
it
was
no
longer
the
benefactor
of
germany
who
fell
at
lutzen
the
beneficent
part
of
his
career
gustavus
adolphus
had
already
terminated
and
now
the
greatest
service
which
he
could
render
to
the
liberties
of
germany
was
to
die
the
power
of
an
individual
was
at
an
end
but
many
came
forward
to
essay
their
strength
the
equivocal
assistance
of
an
protector
gave
place
to
a
more
noble
on
the
part
of
the
estates
and
those
who
were
formerly
the
mere
instruments
of
his
aggrandizement
now
began
to
work
for
themselves
they
now
looked
to
their
own
exertions
for
the
emancipation
which
could
not
be
received
without
danger
from
the
hand
of
the
mighty
and
the
swedish
power
now
incapable
of
sinking
into
the
oppressor
was
henceforth
restricted
to
the
more
modest
part
of
an
ally
the
ambition
of
the
swedish
monarch
aspired
unquestionably
to
establish
a
power
within
germany
and
to
attain
a
firm
footing
in
the
centre
of
the
empire
which
was
inconsistent
with
the
liberties
of
the
estates
his
aim
was
the
imperial
crown
and
this
dignity
supported
by
his
power
and
maintained
by
his
energy
and
activity
would
in
his
hands
be
liable
to
more
abuse
than
had
ever
been
feared
from
the
house
of
austria
born
in
a
foreign
country
educated
in
the
maxims
of
arbitrary
power
and
by
principles
and
enthusiasm
a
determined
enemy
to
popery
he
was
ill
qualified
to
maintain
inviolate
the
constitution
of
the
german
states
or
to
respect
their
liberties
the
coercive
homage
which
augsburg
with
many
other
cities
was
forced
to
pay
to
the
swedish
crown
bespoke
the
conqueror
rather
than
the
protector
of
the
empire
and
this
town
prouder
of
the
title
of
a
royal
city
than
of
the
higher
dignity
of
the
freedom
of
the
empire
flattered
itself
with
the
anticipation
of
becoming
the
capital
of
his
future
kingdom
his
attempts
upon
the
electorate
of
mentz
which
he
first
intended
to
bestow
upon
the
elector
of
brandenburg
as
the
dower
of
his
daughter
christina
and
afterwards
destined
for
his
chancellor
and
friend
oxenstiern
evinced
plainly
what
liberties
he
was
disposed
to
take
with
the
constitution
of
the
empire
his
allies
the
protestant
princes
had
claims
on
his
gratitude
which
could
be
satisfied
only
at
the
expense
of
their
roman
catholic
neighbours
and
particularly
of
the
immediate
ecclesiastical
chapters
and
it
seems
probable
a
plan
was
early
formed
for
dividing
the
conquered
provinces
after
the
precedent
of
the
barbarian
hordes
who
overran
the
german
empire
as
a
common
spoil
among
the
german
and
swedish
confederates
in
his
treatment
of
the
elector
palatine
he
entirely
belied
the
magnanimity
of
the
hero
and
forgot
the
sacred
character
of
a
protector
the
palatinate
was
in
his
hands
and
the
obligations
both
of
justice
and
honour
demanded
its
full
and
immediate
restoration
to
the
legitimate
sovereign
but
by
a
subtlety
unworthy
of
a
great
mind
and
disgraceful
to
the
honourable
title
of
protector
of
the
oppressed
he
eluded
that
obligation
he
treated
the
palatinate
as
a
conquest
wrested
from
the
enemy
and
thought
that
this
circumstance
gave
him
a
right
to
deal
with
it
as
he
pleased
he
surrendered
it
to
the
elector
as
a
favour
not
as
a
debt
and
that
too
as
a
swedish
fief
fettered
by
conditions
which
diminished
half
its
value
and
degraded
this
unfortunate
prince
into
a
humble
vassal
of
sweden
one
of
these
conditions
obliged
the
elector
after
the
conclusion
of
the
war
to
furnish
along
with
the
other
princes
his
contribution
towards
the
maintenance
of
the
swedish
army
a
condition
which
plainly
indicates
the
fate
which
in
the
event
of
the
ultimate
success
of
the
king
awaited
germany
his
sudden
disappearance
secured
the
liberties
of
germany
and
saved
his
reputation
while
it
probably
spared
him
the
mortification
of
seeing
his
own
allies
in
arms
against
him
and
all
the
fruits
of
his
victories
torn
from
him
by
a
disadvantageous
peace
saxony

already
disposed
to
abandon
him

his
success

jealousy

at
the
rapid
growth
of

the
allied
powers
with
the
death
of
gustavus
adolphus
the
enemy
had
formed
new
hopes
and
however
gloomy
might
be
the
situation
of
his
affairs
after
the
battle
of
lutzen
still
the
death
of
his
dreaded
rival
was
an
event
too
disastrous
to
the
allies
and
too
favourable
for
the
emperor
not
to
justify
him
in
entertaining
the
most
brilliant
expectations
and
not
to
encourage
him
to
the
prosecution
of
the
war
its
inevitable
consequence
for
the
moment
at
least
must
be
want
of
union
among
the
allies
and
what
might
not
the
emperor
and
the
league
gain
from
such
a
division
of
their
enemies
he
was
not
likely
to
sacrifice
such
prospects
as
the
present
turn
of
affairs
held
out
to
him
for
any
peace
not
highly
beneficial
to
himself
and
such
a
peace
the
allies
would
not
be
disposed
to
accept
they
naturally
determined
therefore
to
continue
the
war
and
for
this
purpose
the
maintenance
of
the
existing
union
was
acknowledged
to
be
indispensable
but
how
was
this
union
to
be
renewed
and
whence
were
to
be
derived
the
necessary
means
for
continuing
the
war
it
was
not
the
power
of
sweden
but
the
talents
and
personal
influence
of
its
late
king
which
had
given
him
so
overwhelming
an
influence
in
germany
so
great
a
command
over
the
minds
of
men
and
even
he
had
innumerable
difficulties
to
overcome
before
he
could
establish
among
the
states
even
a
weak
and
wavering
alliance
with
his
death
vanished
all
which
his
personal
qualities
alone
had
rendered
practicable
and
the
mutual
obligation
of
the
states
seemed
to
cease
with
the
hopes
on
which
it
had
been
founded
several
impatiently
threw
off
the
yoke
which
had
always
been
irksome
others
hastened
to
seize
the
helm
which
they
had
unwillingly
seen
in
the
hands
of
gustavus
but
which
during
his
lifetime
they
did
not
dare
to
dispute
with
him
some
were
tempted
by
the
seductive
promises
of
the
emperor
to
abandon
the
alliance
others
oppressed
by
the
heavy
burdens
of
a
fourteen
years
war
longed
for
the
repose
of
peace
upon
any
conditions
however
ruinous
the
generals
of
the
army
partly
german
princes
acknowledged
no
common
head
and
no
one
would
stoop
to
receive
orders
from
another
unanimity
vanished
alike
from
the
cabinet
and
the
field
and
their
common
weal
was
threatened
with
ruin
by
the
spirit
of
disunion
gustavus
had
left
no
male
heir
to
the
crown
of
sweden
his
daughter
christina
then
six
years
old
was
the
natural
heir
the
unavoidable
weakness
of
a
regency
suited
ill
with
that
energy
and
resolution
which
sweden
would
be
called
upon
to
display
in
this
trying
conjuncture
the
wide
reaching
mind
of
gustavus
adolphus
had
raised
this
unimportant
and
hitherto
unknown
kingdom
to
a
rank
among
the
powers
of
europe
which
it
could
not
retain
without
the
fortune
and
genius
of
its
author
and
from
which
it
could
not
recede
without
a
humiliating
confession
of
weakness
though
the
german
war
had
been
conducted
chiefly
on
the
resources
of
germany
yet
even
the
small
contribution
of
men
and
money
which
sweden
furnished
had
sufficed
to
exhaust
the
finances
of
that
poor
kingdom
and
the
peasantry
groaned
beneath
the
imposts
necessarily
laid
upon
them
the
plunder
gained
in
germany
enriched
only
a
few
individuals
among
the
nobles
and
the
soldiers
while
sweden
itself
remained
poor
as
before
for
a
time
it
is
true
the
national
glory
reconciled
the
subject
to
these
burdens
and
the
sums
exacted
seemed
but
as
a
loan
placed
at
interest
in
the
fortunate
hand
of
gustavus
adolphus
to
be
richly
repaid
by
the
grateful
monarch
at
the
conclusion
of
a
glorious
peace
but
with
the
king
death
this
hope
vanished
and
the
deluded
people
now
loudly
demanded
relief
from
their
burdens
but
the
spirit
of
gustavus
adolphus
still
lived
in
the
men
to
whom
he
had
confided
the
administration
of
the
kingdom
however
dreadful
to
them
and
unexpected
was
the
intelligence
of
his
death
it
did
not
deprive
them
of
their
manly
courage
and
the
spirit
of
ancient
rome
under
the
invasion
of
brennus
and
hannibal
animated
this
noble
assembly
the
greater
the
price
at
which
these
advantages
had
been
purchased
the
less
readily
could
they
reconcile
themselves
to
renounce
them
not
unrevenged
was
a
king
to
be
sacrificed
called
on
to
choose
between
a
doubtful
and
exhausting
war
and
a
profitable
but
disgraceful
peace
the
swedish
council
of
state
boldly
espoused
the
side
of
danger
and
honour
and
with
agreeable
surprise
men
beheld
this
venerable
senate
acting
with
all
the
energy
and
enthusiasm
of
youth
surrounded
with
watchful
enemies
both
within
and
without
and
threatened
on
every
side
with
danger
they
armed
themselves
against
them
all
with
equal
prudence
and
heroism
and
laboured
to
extend
their
kingdom
even
at
the
moment
when
they
had
to
struggle
for
its
existence
the
decease
of
the
king
and
the
minority
of
his
daughter
christina
renewed
the
claims
of
poland
to
the
swedish
throne
and
king
ladislaus
the
son
of
sigismund
spared
no
intrigues
to
gain
a
party
in
sweden
on
this
ground
the
regency
lost
no
time
in
proclaiming
the
young
queen
and
arranging
the
administration
of
the
regency
all
the
officers
of
the
kingdom
were
summoned
to
do
homage
to
their
new
princess
all
correspondence
with
poland
prohibited
and
the
edicts
of
previous
monarchs
against
the
heirs
of
sigismund
confirmed
by
a
solemn
act
of
the
nation
the
alliance
with
the
czar
of
muscovy
was
carefully
renewed
in
order
by
the
arms
of
this
prince
to
keep
the
hostile
poles
in
check
the
death
of
gustavus
adolphus
had
put
an
end
to
the
jealousy
of
denmark
and
removed
the
grounds
of
alarm
which
had
stood
in
the
way
of
a
good
understanding
between
the
two
states
the
representations
by
which
the
enemy
sought
to
stir
up
christian
iv
against
sweden
were
no
longer
listened
to
and
the
strong
wish
the
danish
monarch
entertained
for
the
marriage
of
his
son
ulrick
with
the
young
princess
combined
with
the
dictates
of
a
sounder
policy
to
incline
him
to
a
neutrality
at
the
same
time
england
holland
and
france
came
forward
with
the
gratifying
assurances
to
the
regency
of
continued
friendship
and
support
and
encouraged
them
with
one
voice
to
prosecute
with
activity
the
war
which
hitherto
had
been
conducted
with
so
much
glory
whatever
reason
france
might
have
to
congratulate
itself
on
the
death
of
the
swedish
conqueror
it
was
as
fully
sensible
of
the
expediency
of
maintaining
the
alliance
with
sweden
without
exposing
itself
to
great
danger
it
could
not
allow
the
power
of
sweden
to
sink
in
germany
want
of
resources
of
its
own
would
either
drive
sweden
to
conclude
a
hasty
and
disadvantageous
peace
with
austria
and
then
all
the
past
efforts
to
lower
the
ascendancy
of
this
dangerous
power
would
be
thrown
away
or
necessity
and
despair
would
drive
the
armies
to
extort
from
the
roman
catholic
states
the
means
of
support
and
france
would
then
be
regarded
as
the
betrayer
of
those
very
states
who
had
placed
themselves
under
her
powerful
protection
the
death
of
gustavus
far
from
breaking
up
the
alliance
between
france
and
sweden
had
only
rendered
it
more
necessary
for
both
and
more
profitable
for
france
now
for
the
first
time
since
he
was
dead
who
had
stretched
his
protecting
arm
over
germany
and
guarded
its
frontiers
against
the
encroaching
designs
of
france
could
the
latter
safely
pursue
its
designs
upon
alsace
and
thus
be
enabled
to
sell
its
aid
to
the
german
protestants
at
a
dearer
rate
strengthened
by
these
alliances
secured
in
its
interior
and
defended
from
without
by
strong
frontier
garrisons
and
fleets
the
regency
did
not
delay
an
instant
to
continue
a
war
by
which
sweden
had
little
of
its
own
to
lose
while
if
success
attended
its
arms
one
or
more
of
the
german
provinces
might
be
won
either
as
a
conquest
or
indemnification
of
its
expenses
secure
amidst
its
seas
sweden
even
if
driven
out
of
germany
would
scarcely
be
exposed
to
greater
peril
than
if
it
voluntarily
retired
from
the
contest
while
the
former
measure
was
as
honourable
as
the
latter
was
disgraceful
the
more
boldness
the
regency
displayed
the
more
confidence
would
they
inspire
among
their
confederates
the
more
respect
among
their
enemies
and
the
more
favourable
conditions
might
they
anticipate
in
the
event
of
peace
if
they
found
themselves
too
weak
to
execute
the
projects
of
gustavus
they
at
least
owed
it
to
this
lofty
model
to
do
their
utmost
and
to
yield
to
no
difficulty
short
of
absolute
necessity
alas
that
motives
of
had
too
great
a
share
in
this
noble
determination
to
demand
our
unqualified
admiration
for
those
who
had
nothing
themselves
to
suffer
from
the
calamities
of
war
but
were
rather
to
be
enriched
by
it
it
was
an
easy
matter
to
resolve
upon
its
continuation
for
the
german
empire
was
in
the
end
to
defray
the
expenses
and
the
provinces
on
which
they
reckoned
would
be
cheaply
purchased
with
the
few
troops
they
sacrificed
to
them
and
with
the
generals
who
were
placed
at
the
head
of
armies
composed
for
the
most
part
of
germans
and
with
the
honourable
superintendence
of
all
the
operations
both
military
and
political
but
this
superintendence
was
irreconcileable
with
the
distance
of
the
swedish
regency
from
the
scene
of
action
and
with
the
slowness
which
necessarily
accompanies
all
the
movements
of
a
council
to
one
comprehensive
mind
must
be
intrusted
the
management
of
swedish
interests
in
germany
and
with
full
powers
to
determine
at
discretion
all
questions
of
war
and
peace
the
necessary
alliances
or
the
acquisitions
made
with
dictatorial
power
and
with
the
whole
influence
of
the
crown
which
he
was
to
represent
must
this
important
magistrate
be
invested
in
order
to
maintain
its
dignity
to
enforce
united
and
combined
operations
to
give
effect
to
his
orders
and
to
supply
the
place
of
the
monarch
whom
he
succeeded
such
a
man
was
found
in
the
chancellor
oxenstiern
the
first
minister
and
what
is
more
the
friend
of
the
deceased
king
who
acquainted
with
all
the
secrets
of
his
master
versed
in
the
politics
of
germany
and
in
the
relations
of
all
the
states
of
europe
was
unquestionably
the
fittest
instrument
to
carry
out
the
plans
of
gustavus
adolphus
in
their
full
extent
oxenstiern
was
on
his
way
to
upper
germany
in
order
to
assemble
the
four
upper
circles
when
the
news
of
the
king
death
reached
him
at
hanau
this
was
a
heavy
blow
both
to
the
friend
and
the
statesman
sweden
indeed
had
lost
but
a
king
germany
a
protector
but
oxenstiern
the
author
of
his
fortunes
the
friend
of
his
soul
and
the
object
of
his
admiration
though
the
greatest
sufferer
in
the
general
loss
he
was
the
first
who
by
his
energy
rose
from
the
blow
and
the
only
one
qualified
to
repair
it
his
penetrating
glance
foresaw
all
the
obstacles
which
would
oppose
the
execution
of
his
plans
the
discouragement
of
the
estates
the
intrigues
of
hostile
courts
the
breaking
up
of
the
confederacy
the
jealousy
of
the
leaders
and
the
dislike
of
princes
of
the
empire
to
submit
to
foreign
authority
but
even
this
deep
insight
into
the
existing
state
of
things
which
revealed
the
whole
extent
of
the
evil
showed
him
also
the
means
by
which
it
might
be
overcome
it
was
essential
to
revive
the
drooping
courage
of
the
weaker
states
to
meet
the
secret
machinations
of
the
enemy
to
allay
the
jealousy
of
the
more
powerful
allies
to
rouse
the
friendly
powers
and
france
in
particular
to
active
assistance
but
above
all
to
repair
the
ruined
edifice
of
the
german
alliance
and
to
reunite
the
scattered
strength
of
the
party
by
a
close
and
permanent
bond
of
union
the
dismay
which
the
loss
of
their
leader
occasioned
the
german
protestants
might
as
readily
dispose
them
to
a
closer
alliance
with
sweden
as
to
a
hasty
peace
with
the
emperor
and
it
depended
entirely
upon
the
course
pursued
which
of
these
alternatives
they
would
adopt
every
thing
might
be
lost
by
the
slightest
sign
of
despondency
nothing
but
the
confidence
which
sweden
showed
in
herself
could
kindle
among
the
germans
a
noble
feeling
of
all
the
attempts
of
austria
to
detach
these
princes
from
the
swedish
alliance
would
be
unavailing
the
moment
their
eyes
became
opened
to
their
true
interests
and
they
were
instigated
to
a
public
and
formal
breach
with
the
emperor
before
these
measures
could
be
taken
and
the
necessary
points
settled
between
the
regency
and
their
minister
a
precious
opportunity
of
action
would
it
is
true
be
lost
to
the
swedish
army
of
which
the
enemy
would
be
sure
to
take
the
utmost
advantage
it
was
in
short
in
the
power
of
the
emperor
totally
to
ruin
the
swedish
interest
in
germany
and
to
this
he
was
actually
invited
by
the
prudent
councils
of
the
duke
of
friedland
wallenstein
advised
him
to
proclaim
a
universal
amnesty
and
to
meet
the
protestant
states
with
favourable
conditions
in
the
first
consternation
produced
by
the
fall
of
gustavus
adolphus
such
a
declaration
would
have
had
the
most
powerful
effects
and
probably
would
have
brought
the
wavering
states
back
to
their
allegiance
but
blinded
by
this
unexpected
turn
of
fortune
and
infatuated
by
spanish
counsels
he
anticipated
a
more
brilliant
issue
from
war
and
instead
of
listening
to
these
propositions
of
an
accommodation
he
hastened
to
augment
his
forces
spain
enriched
by
the
grant
of
the
tenth
of
the
ecclesiastical
possessions
which
the
pope
confirmed
sent
him
considerable
supplies
negociated
for
him
at
the
saxon
court
and
hastily
levied
troops
for
him
in
italy
to
be
employed
in
germany
the
elector
of
bavaria
also
considerably
increased
his
military
force
and
the
restless
disposition
of
the
duke
of
lorraine
did
not
permit
him
to
remain
inactive
in
this
favourable
change
of
fortune
but
while
the
enemy
were
thus
busy
to
profit
by
the
disaster
of
sweden
oxenstiern
was
diligent
to
avert
its
most
fatal
consequences
less
apprehensive
of
open
enemies
than
of
the
jealousy
of
the
friendly
powers
he
left
upper
germany
which
he
had
secured
by
conquests
and
alliances
and
set
out
in
person
to
prevent
a
total
defection
of
the
lower
german
states
or
what
would
have
been
almost
equally
ruinous
to
sweden
a
private
alliance
among
themselves
offended
at
the
boldness
with
which
the
chancellor
assumed
the
direction
of
affairs
and
inwardly
exasperated
at
the
thought
of
being
dictated
to
by
a
swedish
nobleman
the
elector
of
saxony
again
meditated
a
dangerous
separation
from
sweden
and
the
only
question
in
his
mind
was
whether
he
should
make
full
terms
with
the
emperor
or
place
himself
at
the
head
of
the
protestants
and
form
a
third
party
in
germany
similar
ideas
were
cherished
by
duke
ulric
of
brunswick
who
indeed
showed
them
openly
enough
by
forbidding
the
swedes
from
recruiting
within
his
dominions
and
inviting
the
lower
saxon
states
to
luneburg
for
the
purpose
of
forming
a
confederacy
among
themselves
the
elector
of
brandenburg
jealous
of
the
influence
which
saxony
was
likely
to
attain
in
lower
germany
alone
manifested
any
zeal
for
the
interests
of
the
swedish
throne
which
in
thought
he
already
destined
for
his
son
at
the
court
of
saxony
oxenstiern
was
no
doubt
honourably
received
but
notwithstanding
the
personal
efforts
of
the
elector
of
brandenburg
empty
promises
of
continued
friendship
were
all
which
he
could
obtain
with
the
duke
of
brunswick
he
was
more
successful
for
with
him
he
ventured
to
assume
a
bolder
tone
sweden
was
at
the
time
in
possession
of
the
see
of
magdeburg
the
bishop
of
which
had
the
power
of
assembling
the
lower
saxon
circle
the
chancellor
now
asserted
the
rights
of
the
crown
and
by
this
spirited
proceeding
put
a
stop
for
the
present
to
this
dangerous
assembly
designed
by
the
duke
the
main
object
however
of
his
present
journey
and
of
his
future
endeavours
a
general
confederacy
of
the
protestants
miscarried
entirely
and
he
was
obliged
to
content
himself
with
some
unsteady
alliances
in
the
saxon
circles
and
with
the
weaker
assistance
of
upper
germany
as
the
bavarians
were
too
powerful
on
the
danube
the
assembly
of
the
four
upper
circles
which
should
have
been
held
at
ulm
was
removed
to
heilbronn
where
deputies
of
more
than
twelve
cities
of
the
empire
with
a
brilliant
crowd
of
doctors
counts
and
princes
attended
the
ambassadors
of
foreign
powers
likewise
france
england
and
holland
attended
this
congress
at
which
oxenstiern
appeared
in
person
with
all
the
splendour
of
the
crown
whose
representative
he
was
he
himself
opened
the
proceedings
and
conducted
the
deliberations
after
receiving
from
all
the
assembled
estates
assurances
of
unshaken
fidelity
perseverance
and
unity
he
required
of
them
solemnly
and
formally
to
declare
the
emperor
and
the
league
as
enemies
but
desirable
as
it
was
for
sweden
to
exasperate
the
between
the
emperor
and
the
estates
into
a
formal
rupture
the
latter
on
the
other
hand
were
equally
indisposed
to
shut
out
the
possibility
of
reconciliation
by
so
decided
a
step
and
to
place
themselves
entirely
in
the
hands
of
the
swedes
they
maintained
that
any
formal
declaration
of
war
was
useless
and
superfluous
where
the
act
would
speak
for
itself
and
their
firmness
on
this
point
silenced
at
last
the
chancellor
warmer
disputes
arose
on
the
third
and
principal
article
of
the
treaty
concerning
the
means
of
prosecuting
the
war
and
the
quota
which
the
several
states
ought
to
furnish
for
the
support
of
the
army
oxenstiern
maxim
to
throw
as
much
as
possible
of
the
common
burden
on
the
states
did
not
suit
very
well
with
their
determination
to
give
as
little
as
possible
the
swedish
chancellor
now
experienced
what
had
been
felt
by
thirty
emperors
before
him
to
their
cost
that
of
all
difficult
undertakings
the
most
difficult
was
to
extort
money
from
the
germans
instead
of
granting
the
necessary
sums
for
the
new
armies
to
be
raised
they
eloquently
dwelt
upon
the
calamities
occasioned
by
the
former
and
demanded
relief
from
the
old
burdens
when
they
were
required
to
submit
to
new
the
irritation
which
the
chancellor
demand
for
money
raised
among
the
states
gave
rise
to
a
thousand
complaints
and
the
outrages
committed
by
the
troops
in
their
marches
and
quarters
were
dwelt
upon
with
a
startling
minuteness
and
truth
in
the
service
of
two
absolute
monarchs
oxenstiern
had
but
little
opportunity
to
become
accustomed
to
the
formalities
and
cautious
proceedings
of
republican
deliberations
or
to
bear
opposition
with
patience
ready
to
act
the
instant
the
necessity
of
action
was
apparent
and
inflexible
in
his
resolution
when
he
had
once
taken
it
he
was
at
a
loss
to
comprehend
the
inconsistency
of
most
men
who
while
they
desire
the
end
are
yet
averse
to
the
means
prompt
and
impetuous
by
nature
he
was
so
on
this
occasion
from
principle
for
every
thing
depended
on
concealing
the
weakness
of
sweden
under
a
firm
and
confident
speech
and
by
assuming
the
tone
of
a
lawgiver
really
to
become
so
it
was
nothing
wonderful
therefore
if
amidst
these
interminable
discussions
with
german
doctors
and
deputies
he
was
entirely
out
of
his
sphere
and
if
the
deliberateness
which
distinguishes
the
character
of
the
germans
in
their
public
deliberations
had
driven
him
almost
to
despair
without
respecting
a
custom
to
which
even
the
most
powerful
of
the
emperors
had
been
obliged
to
conform
he
rejected
all
written
deliberations
which
suited
so
well
with
the
national
slowness
of
resolve
he
could
not
conceive
how
ten
days
could
be
spent
in
debating
a
measure
which
with
himself
was
decided
upon
its
bare
suggestion
harshly
however
as
he
treated
the
states
he
found
them
ready
enough
to
assent
to
his
fourth
motion
which
concerned
himself
when
he
pointed
out
the
necessity
of
giving
a
head
and
a
director
to
the
new
confederation
that
honour
was
unanimously
assigned
to
sweden
and
he
himself
was
humbly
requested
to
give
to
the
common
cause
the
benefit
of
his
enlightened
experience
and
to
take
upon
himself
the
burden
of
the
supreme
command
but
in
order
to
prevent
his
abusing
the
great
powers
thus
conferred
upon
him
it
was
proposed
not
without
french
influence
to
appoint
a
number
of
overseers
in
fact
under
the
name
of
assistants
to
control
the
expenditure
of
the
common
treasure
and
to
consult
with
him
as
to
the
levies
marches
and
quarterings
of
the
troops
oxenstiern
long
and
strenuously
resisted
this
limitation
of
his
authority
which
could
not
fail
to
trammel
him
in
the
execution
of
every
enterprise
requiring
promptitude
or
secrecy
and
at
last
succeeded
with
difficulty
in
obtaining
so
far
a
modification
of
it
that
his
management
in
affairs
of
war
was
to
be
uncontrolled
the
chancellor
finally
approached
the
delicate
point
of
the
indemnification
which
sweden
was
to
expect
at
the
conclusion
of
the
war
from
the
gratitude
of
the
allies
and
flattered
himself
with
the
hope
that
pomerania
the
main
object
of
sweden
would
be
assigned
to
her
and
that
he
would
obtain
from
the
provinces
assurances
of
effectual
cooperation
in
its
acquisition
but
he
could
obtain
nothing
more
than
a
vague
assurance
that
in
a
general
peace
the
interests
of
all
parties
would
be
attended
to
that
on
this
point
the
caution
of
the
estates
was
not
owing
to
any
regard
for
the
constitution
of
the
empire
became
manifest
from
the
liberality
they
evinced
towards
the
chancellor
at
the
expense
of
the
most
sacred
laws
of
the
empire
they
were
ready
to
grant
him
the
archbishopric
of
mentz
which
he
already
held
as
a
conquest
and
only
with
difficulty
did
the
french
ambassador
succeed
in
preventing
a
step
which
was
as
impolitic
as
it
was
disgraceful
though
on
the
whole
the
result
of
the
congress
had
fallen
far
short
of
oxenstiern
expectations
he
had
at
least
gained
for
himself
and
his
crown
his
main
object
namely
the
direction
of
the
whole
confederacy
he
had
also
succeeded
in
strengthening
the
bond
of
union
between
the
four
upper
circles
and
obtained
from
the
states
a
yearly
contribution
of
two
millions
and
a
half
of
dollars
for
the
maintenance
of
the
army
these
concessions
on
the
part
of
the
states
demanded
some
return
from
sweden
a
few
weeks
after
the
death
of
gustavus
adolphus
sorrow
ended
the
days
of
the
unfortunate
elector
palatine
for
eight
months
he
had
swelled
the
pomp
of
his
protector
court
and
expended
on
it
the
small
remainder
of
his
patrimony
he
was
at
last
approaching
the
goal
of
his
wishes
and
the
prospect
of
a
brighter
future
was
opening
when
death
deprived
him
of
his
protector
but
what
he
regarded
as
the
greatest
calamity
was
highly
favourable
to
his
heirs
gustavus
might
venture
to
delay
the
restoration
of
his
dominions
or
to
load
the
gift
with
hard
conditions
but
oxenstiern
to
whom
the
friendship
of
england
holland
and
brandenburg
and
the
good
opinion
of
the
reformed
states
were
indispensable
felt
the
necessity
of
immediately
fulfilling
the
obligations
of
justice
at
this
assembly
at
heilbronn
therefore
he
engaged
to
surrender
to
frederick
heirs
the
whole
palatinate
both
the
part
already
conquered
and
that
which
remained
to
be
conquered
with
the
exception
of
manheim
which
the
swedes
were
to
hold
until
they
should
be
indemnified
for
their
expenses
the
chancellor
did
not
confine
his
liberality
to
the
family
of
the
palatine
alone
the
other
allied
princes
received
proofs
though
at
a
later
period
of
the
gratitude
of
sweden
which
however
she
dispensed
at
little
cost
to
herself
impartiality
the
most
sacred
obligation
of
the
historian
here
compels
us
to
an
admission
not
much
to
the
honour
of
the
champions
of
german
liberty
however
the
protestant
princes
might
boast
of
the
justice
of
their
cause
and
the
sincerity
of
their
conviction
still
the
motives
from
which
they
acted
were
selfish
enough
and
the
desire
of
stripping
others
of
their
possessions
had
at
least
as
great
a
share
in
the
commencement
of
hostilities
as
the
fear
of
being
deprived
of
their
own
gustavus
soon
found
that
he
might
reckon
much
more
on
these
selfish
motives
than
on
their
patriotic
zeal
and
did
not
fail
to
avail
himself
of
them
each
of
his
confederates
received
from
him
the
promise
of
some
possession
either
already
wrested
or
to
be
afterwards
taken
from
the
enemy
and
death
alone
prevented
him
from
fulfilling
these
engagements
what
prudence
had
suggested
to
the
king
necessity
now
prescribed
to
his
successor
if
it
was
his
object
to
continue
the
war
he
must
be
ready
to
divide
the
spoil
among
the
allies
and
promise
them
advantages
from
the
confusion
which
it
was
his
object
to
continue
thus
he
promised
to
the
landgrave
of
hesse
the
abbacies
of
paderborn
corvey
munster
and
fulda
to
duke
bernard
of
weimar
the
franconian
bishoprics
to
the
duke
of
wirtemberg
the
ecclesiastical
domains
and
the
austrian
counties
lying
within
his
territories
all
under
the
title
of
fiefs
of
sweden
this
spectacle
so
strange
and
so
dishonourable
to
the
german
character
surprised
the
chancellor
who
found
it
difficult
to
repress
his
contempt
and
on
one
occasion
exclaimed
let
it
be
writ
in
our
records
for
an
everlasting
memorial
that
a
german
prince
made
such
a
request
of
a
swedish
nobleman
and
that
the
swedish
nobleman
granted
it
to
the
german
upon
german
ground
after
these
successful
measures
he
was
in
a
condition
to
take
the
field
and
prosecute
the
war
with
fresh
vigour
soon
after
the
victory
at
lutzen
the
troops
of
saxony
and
lunenburg
united
with
the
swedish
main
body
and
the
imperialists
were
in
a
short
time
totally
driven
from
saxony
the
united
army
again
divided
the
saxons
marched
towards
lusatia
and
silesia
to
act
in
conjunction
with
count
thurn
against
the
austrians
in
that
quarter
a
part
of
the
swedish
army
was
led
by
the
duke
of
weimar
into
franconia
and
the
other
by
george
duke
of
brunswick
into
westphalia
and
lower
saxony
the
conquests
on
the
lech
and
the
danube
during
gustavus
expedition
into
saxony
had
been
maintained
by
the
palatine
of
birkenfeld
and
the
swedish
general
banner
against
the
bavarians
but
unable
to
hold
their
ground
against
the
victorious
progress
of
the
latter
supported
as
they
were
by
the
bravery
and
military
experience
of
the
imperial
general
altringer
they
were
under
the
necessity
of
summoning
the
swedish
general
horn
to
their
assistance
from
alsace
this
experienced
general
having
captured
the
towns
of
benfeld
schlettstadt
colmar
and
hagenau
committed
the
defence
of
them
to
the
rhinegrave
otto
louis
and
hastily
crossed
the
rhine
to
form
a
junction
with
banner
army
but
although
the
combined
force
amounted
to
more
than
they
could
not
prevent
the
enemy
from
obtaining
a
strong
position
on
the
swabian
frontier
taking
kempten
and
being
joined
by
seven
regiments
from
bohemia
in
order
to
retain
the
command
of
the
important
banks
of
the
lech
and
the
danube
they
were
under
the
necessity
of
recalling
the
rhinegrave
otto
louis
from
alsace
where
he
had
after
the
departure
of
horn
found
it
difficult
to
defend
himself
against
the
exasperated
peasantry
with
his
army
he
was
now
summoned
to
strengthen
the
army
on
the
danube
and
as
even
this
reinforcement
was
insufficient
duke
bernard
of
weimar
was
earnestly
pressed
to
turn
his
arms
into
this
quarter
duke
bernard
soon
after
the
opening
of
the
campaign
of
had
made
himself
master
of
the
town
and
territory
of
bamberg
and
was
now
threatening
wurtzburg
but
on
receiving
the
summons
of
general
horn
without
delay
he
began
his
march
towards
the
danube
defeated
on
his
way
a
bavarian
army
under
john
de
werth
and
joined
the
swedes
near
donauwerth
this
numerous
force
commanded
by
excellent
generals
now
threatened
bavaria
with
a
fearful
inroad
the
bishopric
of
eichstadt
was
completely
overrun
and
ingoldstadt
was
on
the
point
of
being
delivered
up
by
treachery
to
the
swedes
altringer
fettered
in
his
movements
by
the
express
order
of
the
duke
of
friedland
and
left
without
assistance
from
bohemia
was
unable
to
check
the
progress
of
the
enemy
the
most
favourable
circumstances
combined
to
further
the
progress
of
the
swedish
arms
in
this
quarter
when
the
operations
of
the
army
were
at
once
stopped
by
a
mutiny
among
the
officers
all
the
previous
successes
in
germany
were
owing
altogether
to
arms
the
greatness
of
gustavus
himself
was
the
work
of
the
army
the
fruit
of
their
discipline
their
bravery
and
their
persevering
courage
under
numberless
dangers
and
privations
however
wisely
his
plans
were
laid
in
the
cabinet
it
was
to
the
army
ultimately
that
he
was
indebted
for
their
execution
and
the
expanding
designs
of
the
general
did
but
continually
impose
new
burdens
on
the
soldiers
all
the
decisive
advantages
of
the
war
had
been
violently
gained
by
a
barbarous
sacrifice
of
the
soldiers
lives
in
winter
campaigns
forced
marches
stormings
and
pitched
battles
for
it
was
gustavus
maxim
never
to
decline
a
battle
so
long
as
it
cost
him
nothing
but
men
the
soldiers
could
not
long
be
kept
ignorant
of
their
own
importance
and
they
justly
demanded
a
share
in
the
spoil
which
had
been
won
by
their
own
blood
yet
frequently
they
hardly
received
their
pay
and
the
rapacity
of
individual
generals
or
the
wants
of
the
state
generally
swallowed
up
the
greater
part
of
the
sums
raised
by
contributions
or
levied
upon
the
conquered
provinces
for
all
the
privations
he
endured
the
soldier
had
no
other
recompense
than
the
doubtful
chance
either
of
plunder
or
promotion
in
both
of
which
he
was
often
disappointed
during
the
lifetime
of
gustavus
adolphus
the
combined
influence
of
fear
and
hope
had
suppressed
any
open
complaint
but
after
his
death
the
murmurs
were
loud
and
universal
and
the
soldiery
seized
the
most
dangerous
moment
to
impress
their
superiors
with
a
sense
of
their
importance
two
officers
pfuhl
and
mitschefal
notorious
as
restless
characters
even
during
the
king
life
set
the
example
in
the
camp
on
the
danube
which
in
a
few
days
was
imitated
by
almost
all
the
officers
of
the
army
they
solemnly
bound
themselves
to
obey
no
orders
till
these
arrears
now
outstanding
for
months
and
even
years
should
be
paid
up
and
a
gratuity
either
in
money
or
lands
made
to
each
man
according
to
his
services
immense
sums
they
said
were
daily
raised
by
contributions
and
all
dissipated
by
a
few
they
were
called
out
to
serve
amidst
frost
and
snow
and
no
reward
requited
their
incessant
labours
the
soldiers
excesses
at
heilbronn
had
been
blamed
but
no
one
ever
talked
of
their
services
the
world
rung
with
the
tidings
of
conquests
and
victories
but
it
was
by
their
hands
that
they
had
been
fought
and
won
the
number
of
the
malcontents
daily
increased
and
they
even
attempted
by
letters
which
were
fortunately
intercepted
to
seduce
the
armies
on
the
rhine
and
in
saxony
neither
the
representations
of
bernard
of
weimar
nor
the
stern
reproaches
of
his
harsher
associate
in
command
could
suppress
this
mutiny
while
the
vehemence
of
horn
seemed
only
to
increase
the
insolence
of
the
insurgents
the
conditions
they
insisted
on
were
that
certain
towns
should
be
assigned
to
each
regiment
for
the
payment
of
arrears
four
weeks
were
allowed
to
the
swedish
chancellor
to
comply
with
these
demands
and
in
case
of
refusal
they
announced
that
they
would
pay
themselves
and
never
more
draw
a
sword
for
sweden
these
pressing
demands
made
at
the
very
time
when
the
military
chest
was
exhausted
and
credit
at
a
low
ebb
greatly
embarrassed
the
chancellor
the
remedy
he
saw
must
be
found
quickly
before
the
contagion
should
spread
to
the
other
troops
and
he
should
be
deserted
by
all
his
armies
at
once
among
all
the
swedish
generals
there
was
only
one
of
sufficient
authority
and
influence
with
the
soldiers
to
put
an
end
to
this
dispute
the
duke
of
weimar
was
the
favourite
of
the
army
and
his
prudent
moderation
had
won
the
of
the
soldiers
while
his
military
experience
had
excited
their
admiration
he
now
undertook
the
task
of
appeasing
the
discontented
troops
but
aware
of
his
importance
he
embraced
the
opportunity
to
make
advantageous
stipulations
for
himself
and
to
make
the
embarrassment
of
the
chancellor
subservient
to
his
own
views
gustavus
adolphus
had
flattered
him
with
the
promise
of
the
duchy
of
franconia
to
be
formed
out
of
the
bishoprics
of
wurtzburg
and
bamberg
and
he
now
insisted
on
the
performance
of
this
pledge
he
at
the
same
time
demanded
the
chief
command
as
generalissimo
of
sweden
the
abuse
which
the
duke
of
weimar
thus
made
of
his
influence
so
irritated
oxenstiern
that
in
the
first
moment
of
his
displeasure
he
gave
him
his
dismissal
from
the
swedish
service
but
he
soon
thought
better
of
it
and
determined
instead
of
sacrificing
so
important
a
leader
to
attach
him
to
the
swedish
interests
at
any
cost
he
therefore
granted
to
him
the
franconian
bishoprics
as
a
fief
of
the
swedish
crown
reserving
however
the
two
fortresses
of
wurtzburg
and
koenigshofen
which
were
to
be
garrisoned
by
the
swedes
and
also
engaged
in
name
of
the
swedish
crown
to
secure
these
territories
to
the
duke
his
demand
of
the
supreme
authority
was
evaded
on
some
specious
pretext
the
duke
did
not
delay
to
display
his
gratitude
for
this
valuable
grant
and
by
his
influence
and
activity
soon
restored
tranquillity
to
the
army
large
sums
of
money
and
still
more
extensive
estates
were
divided
among
the
officers
amounting
in
value
to
about
five
millions
of
dollars
and
to
which
they
had
no
other
right
but
that
of
conquest
in
the
mean
time
however
the
opportunity
for
a
great
undertaking
had
been
lost
and
the
united
generals
divided
their
forces
to
oppose
the
enemy
in
other
quarters
gustavus
horn
after
a
short
inroad
into
the
upper
palatinate
and
the
capture
of
neumark
directed
his
march
towards
the
swabian
frontier
where
the
imperialists
strongly
reinforced
threatened
wuertemberg
at
his
approach
the
enemy
retired
to
the
lake
of
constance
but
only
to
show
the
swedes
the
road
into
a
district
hitherto
unvisited
by
war
a
post
on
the
entrance
to
switzerland
would
be
highly
serviceable
to
the
swedes
and
the
town
of
kostnitz
seemed
peculiarly
well
fitted
to
be
a
point
of
communication
between
him
and
the
confederated
cantons
accordingly
gustavus
horn
immediately
commenced
the
siege
of
it
but
destitute
of
artillery
for
which
he
was
obliged
to
send
to
wirtemberg
he
could
not
press
the
attack
with
sufficient
vigour
to
prevent
the
enemy
from
throwing
supplies
into
the
town
which
the
lake
afforded
them
convenient
opportunity
of
doing
he
therefore
after
an
ineffectual
attempt
quitted
the
place
and
its
neighbourhood
and
hastened
to
meet
a
more
threatening
danger
upon
the
danube
at
the
emperor
instigation
the
cardinal
infante
the
brother
of
philip
iv
of
spain
and
the
viceroy
of
milan
had
raised
an
army
of
men
intended
to
act
upon
the
rhine
independently
of
wallenstein
and
to
protect
alsace
this
force
now
appeared
in
bavaria
under
the
command
of
the
duke
of
feria
a
spaniard
and
that
they
might
be
directly
employed
against
the
swedes
altringer
was
ordered
to
join
them
with
his
corps
upon
the
first
intelligence
of
their
approach
horn
had
summoned
to
his
assistance
the
palsgrave
of
birkenfeld
from
the
rhine
and
being
joined
by
him
at
stockach
boldly
advanced
to
meet
the
enemy
army
of
men
the
latter
had
taken
the
route
across
the
danube
into
swabia
where
gustavus
horn
came
so
close
upon
them
that
the
two
armies
were
only
separated
from
each
other
by
half
a
german
mile
but
instead
of
accepting
the
offer
of
battle
the
imperialists
moved
by
the
forest
towns
towards
briesgau
and
alsace
where
they
arrived
in
time
to
relieve
breysack
and
to
arrest
the
victorious
progress
of
the
rhinegrave
otto
louis
the
latter
had
shortly
before
taken
the
forest
towns
and
supported
by
the
palatine
of
birkenfeld
who
had
liberated
the
lower
palatinate
and
beaten
the
duke
of
lorraine
out
of
the
field
had
once
more
given
the
superiority
to
the
swedish
arms
in
that
quarter
he
was
now
forced
to
retire
before
the
superior
numbers
of
the
enemy
but
horn
and
birkenfeld
quickly
advanced
to
his
support
and
the
imperialists
after
a
brief
triumph
were
again
expelled
from
alsace
the
severity
of
the
autumn
in
which
this
hapless
retreat
had
to
be
conducted
proved
fatal
to
most
of
the
italians
and
their
leader
the
duke
of
feria
died
of
grief
at
the
failure
of
his
enterprise
in
the
mean
time
duke
bernard
of
weimar
had
taken
up
his
position
on
the
danube
with
eighteen
regiments
of
infantry
and
squadrons
of
horse
to
cover
franconia
and
to
watch
the
movements
of
the
army
upon
that
river
no
sooner
had
altringer
departed
to
join
the
italians
under
feria
than
bernard
profiting
by
his
absence
hastened
across
the
danube
and
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
appeared
before
ratisbon
the
possession
of
this
town
would
ensure
the
success
of
the
swedish
designs
upon
bavaria
and
austria
it
would
establish
them
firmly
on
the
danube
and
provide
a
safe
refuge
in
case
of
defeat
while
it
alone
could
give
permanence
to
their
conquests
in
that
quarter
to
defend
ratisbon
was
the
urgent
advice
which
the
dying
tilly
left
to
the
elector
and
gustavus
adolphus
had
lamented
it
as
an
irreparable
loss
that
the
bavarians
had
anticipated
him
in
taking
possession
of
this
place
indescribable
therefore
was
the
consternation
of
maximilian
when
duke
bernard
suddenly
appeared
before
the
town
and
prepared
in
earnest
to
besiege
it
the
garrison
consisted
of
not
more
than
fifteen
companies
mostly
soldiers
although
that
number
was
more
than
sufficient
to
weary
out
an
enemy
of
far
superior
force
if
supported
by
and
warlike
inhabitants
but
this
was
not
the
greatest
danger
which
the
bavarian
garrison
had
to
contend
against
the
protestant
inhabitants
of
ratisbon
equally
jealous
of
their
civil
and
religious
freedom
had
unwillingly
submitted
to
the
yoke
of
bavaria
and
had
long
looked
with
impatience
for
the
appearance
of
a
deliverer
bernard
arrival
before
the
walls
filled
them
with
lively
joy
and
there
was
much
reason
to
fear
that
they
would
support
the
attempts
of
the
besiegers
without
by
exciting
a
tumult
within
in
this
perplexity
the
elector
addressed
the
most
pressing
entreaties
to
the
emperor
and
the
duke
of
friedland
to
assist
him
were
it
only
with
men
seven
messengers
in
succession
were
despatched
by
ferdinand
to
wallenstein
who
promised
immediate
succours
and
even
announced
to
the
elector
the
near
advance
of
men
under
gallas
but
at
the
same
time
forbade
that
general
under
pain
of
death
to
march
meanwhile
the
bavarian
commandant
of
ratisbon
in
the
hope
of
speedy
assistance
made
the
best
preparations
for
defence
armed
the
roman
catholic
peasants
disarmed
and
carefully
watched
the
protestant
citizens
lest
they
should
attempt
any
hostile
design
against
the
garrison
but
as
no
relief
arrived
and
the
enemy
artillery
incessantly
battered
the
walls
he
consulted
his
own
safety
and
that
of
the
garrison
by
an
honourable
capitulation
and
abandoned
the
bavarian
officials
and
ecclesiastics
to
the
conqueror
mercy
the
possession
of
ratisbon
enlarged
the
projects
of
the
duke
and
bavaria
itself
now
appeared
too
narrow
a
field
for
his
bold
designs
he
determined
to
penetrate
to
the
frontiers
of
austria
to
arm
the
protestant
peasantry
against
the
emperor
and
restore
to
them
their
religious
liberty
he
had
already
taken
straubingen
while
another
swedish
army
was
advancing
successfully
along
the
northern
bank
of
the
danube
at
the
head
of
his
swedes
bidding
defiance
to
the
severity
of
the
weather
he
reached
the
mouth
of
the
iser
which
he
passed
in
the
presence
of
the
bavarian
general
werth
who
was
encamped
on
that
river
passau
and
lintz
trembled
for
their
fate
the
terrified
emperor
redoubled
his
entreaties
and
commands
to
wallenstein
to
hasten
with
all
speed
to
the
relief
of
the
bavarians
but
here
the
victorious
bernard
of
his
own
accord
checked
his
career
of
conquest
having
in
front
of
him
the
river
inn
guarded
by
a
number
of
strong
fortresses
and
behind
him
two
hostile
armies
a
disaffected
country
and
the
river
iser
while
his
rear
was
covered
by
no
tenable
position
and
no
entrenchment
could
be
made
in
the
frozen
ground
and
threatened
by
the
whole
force
of
wallenstein
who
had
at
last
resolved
to
march
to
the
danube
by
a
timely
retreat
he
escaped
the
danger
of
being
cut
off
from
ratisbon
and
surrounded
by
the
enemy
he
hastened
across
the
iser
to
the
danube
to
defend
the
conquests
he
had
made
in
the
upper
palatinate
against
wallenstein
and
fully
resolved
not
to
decline
a
battle
if
necessary
with
that
general
but
wallenstein
who
was
not
disposed
for
any
great
exploits
on
the
danube
did
not
wait
for
his
approach
and
before
the
bavarians
could
congratulate
themselves
on
his
arrival
he
suddenly
withdrew
again
into
bohemia
the
duke
thus
ended
his
victorious
campaign
and
allowed
his
troops
their
repose
in
winter
quarters
upon
an
enemy
country
while
in
swabia
the
war
was
thus
successfully
conducted
by
gustavus
horn
and
on
the
upper
and
lower
rhine
by
the
palatine
of
birkenfeld
general
baudissen
and
the
rhinegrave
otto
louis
and
by
duke
bernard
on
the
danube
the
reputation
of
the
swedish
arms
was
as
gloriously
sustained
in
lower
saxony
and
westphalia
by
the
duke
of
lunenburg
and
the
landgrave
of
hesse
cassel
the
fortress
of
hamel
was
taken
by
duke
george
after
a
brave
defence
and
a
brilliant
victory
obtained
over
the
imperial
general
gronsfeld
by
the
united
swedish
and
hessian
armies
near
oldendorf
count
wasaburg
a
natural
son
of
gustavus
adolphus
showed
himself
in
this
battle
worthy
of
his
descent
sixteen
pieces
of
cannon
the
whole
baggage
of
the
imperialists
together
with
colours
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
swedes
of
the
enemy
perished
on
the
field
and
nearly
the
same
number
were
taken
prisoners
the
town
of
osnaburg
surrendered
to
the
swedish
colonel
knyphausen
and
paderborn
to
the
landgrave
of
hesse
while
on
the
other
hand
bueckeburg
a
very
important
place
for
the
swedes
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
imperialists
the
swedish
banners
were
victorious
in
almost
every
quarter
of
germany
and
the
year
after
the
death
of
gustavus
left
no
trace
of
the
loss
which
had
been
sustained
in
the
person
of
that
great
leader
in
a
review
of
the
important
events
which
signalized
the
campaign
of
the
inactivity
of
a
man
of
whom
the
highest
expectations
had
been
formed
justly
excites
astonishment
among
all
the
generals
who
distinguished
themselves
in
this
campaign
none
could
be
compared
with
wallenstein
in
experience
talents
and
reputation
and
yet
after
the
battle
of
lutzen
we
lose
sight
of
him
entirely
the
fall
of
his
great
rival
had
left
the
whole
theatre
of
glory
open
to
him
all
europe
was
now
attentively
awaiting
those
exploits
which
should
efface
the
remembrance
of
his
defeat
and
still
prove
to
the
world
his
military
superiority
nevertheless
he
continued
inactive
in
bohemia
while
the
emperor
losses
in
bavaria
lower
saxony
and
the
rhine
pressingly
called
for
his
presence
a
conduct
equally
unintelligible
to
friend
and
foe
the
terror
and
at
the
same
time
the
last
hope
of
the
emperor
after
the
defeat
of
lutzen
he
had
hastened
into
bohemia
where
he
instituted
the
strictest
inquiry
into
the
conduct
of
his
officers
in
that
battle
those
whom
the
council
of
war
declared
guilty
of
misconduct
were
put
to
death
without
mercy
those
who
had
behaved
with
bravery
rewarded
with
princely
munificence
and
the
memory
of
the
dead
honoured
by
splendid
monuments
during
the
winter
he
oppressed
the
imperial
provinces
by
enormous
contributions
and
exhausted
the
austrian
territories
by
his
winter
quarters
which
he
purposely
avoided
taking
up
in
an
enemy
country
and
in
the
spring
of
instead
of
being
the
first
to
open
the
campaign
with
this
and
army
and
to
make
a
worthy
display
of
his
great
abilities
he
was
the
last
who
appeared
in
the
field
and
even
then
it
was
an
hereditary
province
of
austria
which
he
selected
as
the
seat
of
war
of
all
the
austrian
provinces
silesia
was
most
exposed
to
danger
three
different
armies
a
swedish
under
count
thurn
a
saxon
under
arnheim
and
the
duke
of
lauenburg
and
one
of
brandenburg
under
borgsdorf
had
at
the
same
time
carried
the
war
into
this
country
they
had
already
taken
possession
of
the
most
important
places
and
even
breslau
had
embraced
the
cause
of
the
allies
but
this
crowd
of
commanders
and
armies
was
the
very
means
of
saving
this
province
to
the
emperor
for
the
jealousy
of
the
generals
and
the
mutual
hatred
of
the
saxons
and
the
swedes
never
allowed
them
to
act
with
unanimity
arnheim
and
thurn
contended
for
the
chief
command
the
troops
of
brandenburg
and
saxony
combined
against
the
swedes
whom
they
looked
upon
as
troublesome
strangers
who
ought
to
be
got
rid
of
as
soon
as
possible
the
saxons
on
the
contrary
lived
on
a
very
intimate
footing
with
the
imperialists
and
the
officers
of
both
these
hostile
armies
often
visited
and
entertained
each
other
the
imperialists
were
allowed
to
remove
their
property
without
hindrance
and
many
did
not
affect
to
conceal
that
they
had
received
large
sums
from
vienna
among
such
equivocal
allies
the
swedes
saw
themselves
sold
and
betrayed
and
any
great
enterprise
was
out
of
the
question
while
so
bad
an
understanding
prevailed
between
the
troops
general
arnheim
too
was
absent
the
greater
part
of
the
time
and
when
he
at
last
returned
wallenstein
was
fast
approaching
the
frontiers
with
a
formidable
force
his
army
amounted
to
men
while
to
oppose
him
the
allies
had
only
they
nevertheless
resolved
to
give
him
battle
and
marched
to
munsterberg
where
he
had
formed
an
intrenched
camp
but
wallenstein
remained
inactive
for
eight
days
he
then
left
his
intrenchments
and
marched
slowly
and
with
composure
to
the
enemy
camp
but
even
after
quitting
his
position
and
when
the
enemy
emboldened
by
his
past
delay
manfully
prepared
to
receive
him
he
declined
the
opportunity
of
fighting
the
caution
with
which
he
avoided
a
battle
was
imputed
to
fear
but
the
reputation
of
wallenstein
enabled
him
to
despise
this
suspicion
the
vanity
of
the
allies
allowed
them
not
to
see
that
he
purposely
saved
them
a
defeat
because
a
victory
at
that
time
would
not
have
served
his
own
ends
to
convince
them
of
his
superior
power
and
that
his
inactivity
proceeded
not
from
any
fear
of
them
he
put
to
death
the
commander
of
a
castle
that
fell
into
his
hands
because
he
had
refused
at
once
to
surrender
an
untenable
place
for
nine
days
did
the
two
armies
remain
within
of
each
other
when
count
terzky
from
the
camp
of
the
imperialists
appeared
with
a
trumpeter
in
that
of
the
allies
inviting
general
arnheim
to
a
conference
the
purport
was
that
wallenstein
notwithstanding
his
superiority
was
willing
to
agree
to
a
cessation
of
arms
for
six
weeks
he
was
come
he
said
to
conclude
a
lasting
peace
with
the
swedes
and
with
the
princes
of
the
empire
to
pay
the
soldiers
and
to
satisfy
every
one
all
this
was
in
his
power
and
if
the
austrian
court
hesitated
to
confirm
his
agreement
he
would
unite
with
the
allies
and
as
he
privately
whispered
to
arnheim
hunt
the
emperor
to
the
devil
at
the
second
conference
he
expressed
himself
still
more
plainly
to
count
thurn
all
the
privileges
of
the
bohemians
he
engaged
should
be
confirmed
anew
the
exiles
recalled
and
restored
to
their
estates
and
he
himself
would
be
the
first
to
resign
his
share
of
them
the
jesuits
as
the
authors
of
all
past
grievances
should
be
banished
the
swedish
crown
indemnified
by
stated
payments
and
all
the
superfluous
troops
on
both
sides
employed
against
the
turks
the
last
article
explained
the
whole
mystery
if
he
continued
he
should
obtain
the
crown
of
bohemia
all
the
exiles
would
have
reason
to
applaud
his
generosity
perfect
toleration
of
religions
should
be
established
within
the
kingdom
the
palatine
family
be
reinstated
in
its
rights
and
he
would
accept
the
margraviate
of
moravia
as
a
compensation
for
mecklenburg
the
allied
armies
would
then
under
his
command
advance
upon
vienna
and
sword
in
hand
compel
the
emperor
to
ratify
the
treaty
thus
was
the
veil
at
last
removed
from
the
schemes
over
which
he
had
brooded
for
years
in
mysterious
silence
every
circumstance
now
convinced
him
that
not
a
moment
was
to
be
lost
in
its
execution
nothing
but
a
blind
confidence
in
the
good
fortune
and
military
genius
of
the
duke
of
friedland
had
induced
the
emperor
in
the
face
of
the
remonstrances
of
bavaria
and
spain
and
at
the
expense
of
his
own
reputation
to
confer
upon
this
imperious
leader
such
an
unlimited
command
but
this
belief
in
wallenstein
being
invincible
had
been
much
weakened
by
his
inaction
and
almost
entirely
overthrown
by
the
defeat
at
lutzen
his
enemies
at
the
imperial
court
now
renewed
their
intrigues
and
the
emperor
disappointment
at
the
failure
of
his
hopes
procured
for
their
remonstrances
a
favourable
reception
wallenstein
whole
conduct
was
now
reviewed
with
the
most
malicious
criticism
his
ambitious
haughtiness
his
disobedience
to
the
emperor
orders
were
recalled
to
the
recollection
of
that
jealous
prince
as
well
as
the
complaints
of
the
austrian
subjects
against
his
boundless
oppression
his
fidelity
was
questioned
and
alarming
hints
thrown
out
as
to
his
secret
views
these
insinuations
which
the
conduct
of
the
duke
seemed
but
too
well
to
justify
failed
not
to
make
a
deep
impression
on
ferdinand
but
the
step
had
been
taken
and
the
great
power
with
which
wallenstein
had
been
invested
could
not
be
taken
from
him
without
danger
insensibly
to
diminish
that
power
was
the
only
course
that
now
remained
and
to
effect
this
it
must
in
the
first
place
be
divided
but
above
all
the
present
dependence
on
the
good
will
of
his
general
put
an
end
to
but
even
this
right
had
been
resigned
in
his
engagement
with
wallenstein
and
the
emperor
own
handwriting
secured
him
against
every
attempt
to
unite
another
general
with
him
in
the
command
or
to
exercise
any
immediate
act
of
authority
over
the
troops
as
this
disadvantageous
contract
could
neither
be
kept
nor
broken
recourse
was
had
to
artifice
wallenstein
was
imperial
generalissimo
in
germany
but
his
command
extended
no
further
and
he
could
not
presume
to
exercise
any
authority
over
a
foreign
army
a
spanish
army
was
accordingly
raised
in
milan
and
marched
into
germany
under
a
spanish
general
wallenstein
now
ceased
to
be
indispensable
because
he
was
no
longer
supreme
and
in
case
of
necessity
the
emperor
was
now
provided
with
the
means
of
support
even
against
him
the
duke
quickly
and
deeply
felt
whence
this
blow
came
and
whither
it
was
aimed
in
vain
did
he
protest
against
this
violation
of
the
compact
to
the
cardinal
infante
the
italian
army
continued
its
march
and
he
was
forced
to
detach
general
altringer
to
join
it
with
a
reinforcement
he
took
care
indeed
so
closely
to
fetter
the
latter
as
to
prevent
the
italian
army
from
acquiring
any
great
reputation
in
alsace
and
swabia
but
this
bold
step
of
the
court
awakened
him
from
his
security
and
warned
him
of
the
approach
of
danger
that
he
might
not
a
second
time
be
deprived
of
his
command
and
lose
the
fruit
of
all
his
labours
he
must
accelerate
the
accomplishment
of
his
long
meditated
designs
he
secured
the
attachment
of
his
troops
by
removing
the
doubtful
officers
and
by
his
liberality
to
the
rest
he
had
sacrificed
to
the
welfare
of
the
army
every
other
order
in
the
state
every
consideration
of
justice
and
humanity
and
therefore
he
reckoned
upon
their
gratitude
at
the
very
moment
when
he
meditated
an
unparalleled
act
of
ingratitude
against
the
author
of
his
own
good
fortune
he
founded
all
his
hopes
upon
the
gratitude
which
was
due
to
himself
the
leaders
of
the
silesian
armies
had
no
authority
from
their
principals
to
consent
on
their
own
discretion
to
such
important
proposals
as
those
of
wallenstein
and
they
did
not
even
feel
themselves
warranted
in
granting
for
more
than
a
fortnight
the
cessation
of
hostilities
which
he
demanded
before
the
duke
disclosed
his
designs
to
sweden
and
saxony
he
had
deemed
it
advisable
to
secure
the
sanction
of
france
to
his
bold
undertaking
for
this
purpose
a
secret
negociation
had
been
carried
on
with
the
greatest
possible
caution
and
distrust
by
count
kinsky
with
feuquieres
the
french
ambassador
at
dresden
and
had
terminated
according
to
his
wishes
feuquieres
received
orders
from
his
court
to
promise
every
assistance
on
the
part
of
france
and
to
offer
the
duke
a
considerable
pecuniary
aid
in
case
of
need
but
it
was
this
excessive
caution
to
secure
himself
on
all
sides
that
led
to
his
ruin
the
french
ambassador
with
astonishment
discovered
that
a
plan
which
more
than
any
other
required
secrecy
had
been
communicated
to
the
swedes
and
the
saxons
and
yet
it
was
generally
known
that
the
saxon
ministry
was
in
the
interests
of
the
emperor
and
on
the
other
hand
the
conditions
offered
to
the
swedes
fell
too
far
short
of
their
expectations
to
be
likely
to
be
accepted
feuquieres
therefore
could
not
believe
that
the
duke
could
be
serious
in
calculating
upon
the
aid
of
the
latter
and
the
silence
of
the
former
he
communicated
accordingly
his
doubts
and
anxieties
to
the
swedish
chancellor
who
equally
distrusted
the
views
of
wallenstein
and
disliked
his
plans
although
it
was
no
secret
to
oxenstiern
that
the
duke
had
formerly
entered
into
a
similar
negociation
with
gustavus
adolphus
he
could
not
credit
the
possibility
of
inducing
a
whole
army
to
revolt
and
of
his
extravagant
promises
so
daring
a
design
and
such
imprudent
conduct
seemed
not
to
be
consistent
with
the
duke
reserved
and
suspicious
temper
and
he
was
the
more
inclined
to
consider
the
whole
as
the
result
of
dissimulation
and
treachery
because
he
had
less
reason
to
doubt
his
prudence
than
his
honesty
oxenstiern
doubts
at
last
affected
arnheim
himself
who
in
full
confidence
in
wallenstein
sincerity
had
repaired
to
the
chancellor
at
gelnhausen
to
persuade
him
to
lend
some
of
his
best
regiments
to
the
duke
to
aid
him
in
the
execution
of
the
plan
they
began
to
suspect
that
the
whole
proposal
was
only
a
snare
to
disarm
the
allies
and
to
betray
the
flower
of
their
troops
into
the
hands
of
the
emperor
wallenstein
character
did
not
contradict
the
suspicion
and
the
inconsistencies
in
which
he
afterwards
involved
himself
entirely
destroyed
all
confidence
in
his
sincerity
while
he
was
endeavouring
to
draw
the
swedes
into
this
alliance
and
requiring
the
help
of
their
best
troops
he
declared
to
arnheim
that
they
must
begin
with
expelling
the
swedes
from
the
empire
and
while
the
saxon
officers
relying
upon
the
security
of
the
truce
repaired
in
great
numbers
to
his
camp
he
made
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
seize
them
he
was
the
first
to
break
the
truce
which
some
months
afterwards
he
renewed
though
not
without
great
difficulty
all
confidence
in
his
sincerity
was
lost
his
whole
conduct
was
regarded
as
a
tissue
of
deceit
and
low
cunning
devised
to
weaken
the
allies
and
repair
his
own
strength
this
indeed
he
actually
did
effect
as
his
own
army
daily
augmented
while
that
of
the
allies
was
reduced
nearly
one
half
by
desertion
and
bad
provisions
but
he
did
not
make
that
use
of
his
superiority
which
vienna
expected
when
all
men
were
looking
for
a
decisive
blow
to
be
struck
he
suddenly
renewed
the
negociations
and
when
the
truce
lulled
the
allies
into
security
he
as
suddenly
recommenced
hostilities
all
these
contradictions
arose
out
of
the
double
and
irreconcileable
designs
to
ruin
at
once
the
emperor
and
the
swedes
and
to
conclude
a
separate
peace
with
the
saxons
impatient
at
the
ill
success
of
his
negociations
he
at
last
determined
to
display
his
strength
the
more
so
as
the
pressing
distress
within
the
empire
and
the
growing
dissatisfaction
of
the
imperial
court
admitted
not
of
his
making
any
longer
delay
before
the
last
cessation
of
hostilities
general
holk
from
bohemia
had
attacked
the
circle
of
meissen
laid
waste
every
thing
on
his
route
with
fire
and
sword
driven
the
elector
into
his
fortresses
and
taken
the
town
of
leipzig
but
the
truce
in
silesia
put
a
period
to
his
ravages
and
the
consequences
of
his
excesses
brought
him
to
the
grave
at
adorf
as
soon
as
hostilities
were
recommenced
wallenstein
made
a
movement
as
if
he
designed
to
penetrate
through
lusatia
into
saxony
and
circulated
the
report
that
piccolomini
had
already
invaded
that
country
arnheim
immediately
broke
up
his
camp
in
silesia
to
follow
him
and
hastened
to
the
assistance
of
the
electorate
by
this
means
the
swedes
were
left
exposed
who
were
encamped
in
small
force
under
count
thurn
at
steinau
on
the
oder
and
this
was
exactly
what
wallenstein
desired
he
allowed
the
saxon
general
to
advance
sixteen
miles
towards
meissen
and
then
suddenly
turning
towards
the
oder
surprised
the
swedish
army
in
the
most
complete
security
their
cavalry
were
first
beaten
by
general
schafgotsch
who
was
sent
against
them
and
the
infantry
completely
surrounded
at
steinau
by
the
duke
army
which
followed
wallenstein
gave
count
thurn
half
an
hour
to
deliberate
whether
he
would
defend
himself
with
men
against
more
than
or
surrender
at
discretion
but
there
was
no
room
for
deliberation
the
army
surrendered
and
the
most
complete
victory
was
obtained
without
bloodshed
colours
baggage
and
artillery
all
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
victors
the
officers
were
taken
into
custody
the
privates
drafted
into
the
army
of
wallenstein
and
now
at
last
after
a
banishment
of
fourteen
years
after
numberless
changes
of
fortune
the
author
of
the
bohemian
insurrection
and
the
remote
origin
of
this
destructive
war
the
notorious
count
thurn
was
in
the
power
of
his
enemies
with
impatience
the
arrival
of
this
great
criminal
was
looked
for
in
vienna
where
they
already
anticipated
the
malicious
triumph
of
sacrificing
so
distinguished
a
victim
to
public
justice
but
to
deprive
the
jesuits
of
this
pleasure
was
a
still
sweeter
triumph
to
wallenstein
and
thurn
was
set
at
liberty
fortunately
for
him
he
knew
more
than
it
was
prudent
to
have
divulged
in
vienna
and
his
enemies
were
also
those
of
wallenstein
a
defeat
might
have
been
forgiven
in
vienna
but
this
disappointment
of
their
hopes
they
could
not
pardon
what
should
i
have
done
with
this
madman
he
writes
with
a
malicious
sneer
to
the
minister
who
called
him
to
account
for
this
unseasonable
magnanimity
would
to
heaven
the
enemy
had
no
generals
but
such
as
he
at
the
head
of
the
swedish
army
he
will
render
us
much
better
service
than
in
prison
the
victory
of
steinau
was
followed
by
the
capture
of
liegnitz
grossglogau
and
even
of
frankfort
on
the
oder
schafgotsch
who
remained
in
silesia
to
complete
the
subjugation
of
that
province
blockaded
brieg
and
threatened
breslau
though
in
vain
as
that
free
town
was
jealous
of
its
privileges
and
devoted
to
the
swedes
colonels
illo
and
goetz
were
ordered
by
wallenstein
to
the
warta
to
push
forwards
into
pomerania
and
to
the
coasts
of
the
baltic
and
actually
obtained
possession
of
landsberg
the
key
of
pomerania
while
thus
the
elector
of
brandenburg
and
the
duke
of
pomerania
were
made
to
tremble
for
their
dominions
wallenstein
himself
with
the
remainder
of
his
army
burst
suddenly
into
lusatia
where
he
took
goerlitz
by
storm
and
forced
bautzen
to
surrender
but
his
object
was
merely
to
alarm
the
elector
of
saxony
not
to
follow
up
the
advantages
already
obtained
and
therefore
even
with
the
sword
in
his
hand
he
continued
his
negociations
for
peace
with
brandenburg
and
saxony
but
with
no
better
success
than
before
as
the
inconsistencies
of
his
conduct
had
destroyed
all
confidence
in
his
sincerity
he
was
therefore
on
the
point
of
turning
his
whole
force
in
earnest
against
the
unfortunate
saxons
and
effecting
his
object
by
force
of
arms
when
circumstances
compelled
him
to
leave
these
territories
the
conquests
of
duke
bernard
upon
the
danube
which
threatened
austria
itself
with
immediate
danger
urgently
demanded
his
presence
in
bavaria
and
the
expulsion
of
the
saxons
and
swedes
from
silesia
deprived
him
of
every
pretext
for
longer
resisting
the
imperial
orders
and
leaving
the
elector
of
bavaria
without
assistance
with
his
main
body
therefore
he
immediately
set
out
for
the
upper
palatinate
and
his
retreat
freed
upper
saxony
for
ever
of
this
formidable
enemy
so
long
as
was
possible
he
had
delayed
to
move
to
the
rescue
of
bavaria
and
on
every
pretext
evaded
the
commands
of
the
emperor
he
had
indeed
after
reiterated
remonstrances
despatched
from
bohemia
a
reinforcement
of
some
regiments
to
count
altringer
who
was
defending
the
lech
and
the
danube
against
horn
and
bernard
but
under
the
express
condition
of
his
acting
merely
on
the
defensive
he
referred
the
emperor
and
the
elector
whenever
they
applied
to
him
for
aid
to
altringer
who
as
he
publicly
gave
out
had
received
unlimited
powers
secretly
however
he
tied
up
his
hands
by
the
strictest
injunctions
and
even
threatened
him
with
death
if
he
exceeded
his
orders
when
duke
bernard
had
appeared
before
ratisbon
and
the
emperor
as
well
as
the
elector
repeated
still
more
urgently
their
demand
for
succour
he
pretended
he
was
about
to
despatch
general
gallas
with
a
considerable
army
to
the
danube
but
this
movement
also
was
delayed
and
ratisbon
straubing
and
cham
as
well
as
the
bishopric
of
eichstaedt
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
swedes
when
at
last
he
could
no
longer
neglect
the
orders
of
the
court
he
marched
slowly
toward
the
bavarian
frontier
where
he
invested
the
town
of
cham
which
had
been
taken
by
the
swedes
but
no
sooner
did
he
learn
that
on
the
swedish
side
a
diversion
was
contemplated
by
an
inroad
of
the
saxons
into
bohemia
than
he
availed
himself
of
the
report
as
a
pretext
for
immediately
retreating
into
that
kingdom
every
consideration
he
urged
must
be
postponed
to
the
defence
and
preservation
of
the
hereditary
dominions
of
the
emperor
and
on
this
plea
he
remained
firmly
fixed
in
bohemia
which
he
guarded
as
if
it
had
been
his
own
property
and
when
the
emperor
laid
upon
him
his
commands
to
move
towards
the
danube
and
prevent
the
duke
of
weimar
from
establishing
himself
in
so
dangerous
a
position
on
the
frontiers
of
austria
wallenstein
thought
proper
to
conclude
the
campaign
a
second
time
and
quartered
his
troops
for
the
winter
in
this
exhausted
kingdom
such
continued
insolence
and
unexampled
contempt
of
the
imperial
orders
as
well
as
obvious
neglect
of
the
common
cause
joined
to
his
equivocal
behaviour
towards
the
enemy
tended
at
last
to
convince
the
emperor
of
the
truth
of
those
unfavourable
reports
with
regard
to
the
duke
which
were
current
through
germany
the
latter
had
for
a
long
time
succeeded
in
glozing
over
his
criminal
correspondence
with
the
enemy
and
persuading
the
emperor
still
prepossessed
in
his
favour
that
the
sole
object
of
his
secret
conferences
was
to
obtain
peace
for
germany
but
impenetrable
as
he
himself
believed
his
proceedings
to
be
in
the
course
of
his
conduct
enough
transpired
to
justify
the
insinuations
with
which
his
rivals
incessantly
loaded
the
ear
of
the
emperor
in
order
to
satisfy
himself
of
the
truth
or
falsehood
of
these
rumours
ferdinand
had
already
at
different
times
sent
spies
into
wallenstein
camp
but
as
the
duke
took
the
precaution
never
to
commit
anything
to
writing
they
returned
with
nothing
but
conjectures
but
when
at
last
those
ministers
who
formerly
had
been
his
champions
at
the
court
in
consequence
of
their
estates
not
being
exempted
by
wallenstein
from
the
general
exactions
joined
his
enemies
when
the
elector
of
bavaria
threatened
in
case
of
wallenstein
being
any
longer
retained
in
the
supreme
command
to
unite
with
the
swedes
when
the
spanish
ambassador
insisted
on
his
dismissal
and
threatened
in
case
of
refusal
to
withdraw
the
subsidies
furnished
by
his
crown
the
emperor
found
himself
a
second
time
compelled
to
deprive
him
of
the
command
the
emperor
authoritative
and
direct
interference
with
the
army
soon
convinced
the
duke
that
the
compact
with
himself
was
regarded
as
at
an
end
and
that
his
dismissal
was
inevitable
one
of
his
inferior
generals
in
austria
whom
he
had
forbidden
under
pain
of
death
to
obey
the
orders
of
the
court
received
the
positive
commands
of
the
emperor
to
join
the
elector
of
bavaria
and
wallenstein
himself
was
imperiously
ordered
to
send
some
regiments
to
reinforce
the
army
of
the
cardinal
infante
who
was
on
his
march
from
italy
all
these
measures
convinced
him
that
the
plan
was
finally
arranged
to
disarm
him
by
degrees
and
at
once
when
he
was
weak
and
defenceless
to
complete
his
ruin
in
must
he
now
hasten
to
carry
into
execution
the
plans
which
he
had
originally
formed
only
with
the
view
to
aggrandizement
he
had
delayed
too
long
either
because
the
favourable
configuration
of
the
stars
had
not
yet
presented
itself
or
as
he
used
to
say
to
check
the
impatience
of
his
friends
because
the
time
was
not
yet
come
the
time
even
now
was
not
come
but
the
pressure
of
circumstances
no
longer
allowed
him
to
await
the
favour
of
the
stars
the
first
step
was
to
assure
himself
of
the
sentiments
of
his
principal
officers
and
then
to
try
the
attachment
of
the
army
which
he
had
so
long
confidently
reckoned
on
three
of
them
colonels
kinsky
terzky
and
illo
had
long
been
in
his
secrets
and
the
two
first
were
further
united
to
his
interests
by
the
ties
of
relationship
the
same
wild
ambition
the
same
bitter
hatred
of
the
government
and
the
hope
of
enormous
rewards
bound
them
in
the
closest
manner
to
wallenstein
who
to
increase
the
number
of
his
adherents
could
stoop
to
the
lowest
means
he
had
once
advised
colonel
illo
to
solicit
in
vienna
the
title
of
count
and
had
promised
to
back
his
application
with
his
powerful
mediation
but
he
secretly
wrote
to
the
ministry
advising
them
to
refuse
his
request
as
to
grant
it
would
give
rise
to
similar
demands
from
others
whose
services
and
claims
were
equal
to
his
on
illo
return
to
the
camp
wallenstein
immediately
demanded
to
know
the
success
of
his
mission
and
when
informed
by
illo
of
its
failure
he
broke
out
into
the
bitterest
complaints
against
the
court
thus
said
he
are
our
faithful
services
rewarded
my
recommendation
is
disregarded
and
your
merit
denied
so
trifling
a
reward
who
would
any
longer
devote
his
services
to
so
ungrateful
a
master
no
for
my
part
i
am
henceforth
the
determined
foe
of
austria
illo
agreed
with
him
and
a
close
alliance
was
cemented
between
them
but
what
was
known
to
these
three
confidants
of
the
duke
was
long
an
impenetrable
secret
to
the
rest
and
the
confidence
with
which
wallenstein
spoke
of
the
devotion
of
his
officers
was
founded
merely
on
the
favours
he
had
lavished
on
them
and
on
their
known
dissatisfaction
with
the
court
but
this
vague
presumption
must
be
converted
into
certainty
before
he
could
venture
to
lay
aside
the
mask
or
take
any
open
step
against
the
emperor
count
piccolomini
who
had
distinguished
himself
by
his
unparalleled
bravery
at
lutzen
was
the
first
whose
fidelity
he
put
to
the
proof
he
had
he
thought
gained
the
attachment
of
this
general
by
large
presents
and
preferred
him
to
all
others
because
born
under
the
same
constellations
with
himself
he
disclosed
to
him
that
in
consequence
of
the
emperor
ingratitude
and
the
near
approach
of
his
own
danger
he
had
irrevocably
determined
entirely
to
abandon
the
party
of
austria
to
join
the
enemy
with
the
best
part
of
his
army
and
to
make
war
upon
the
house
of
austria
on
all
sides
of
its
dominions
till
he
had
wholly
extirpated
it
in
the
execution
of
this
plan
he
principally
reckoned
on
the
services
of
piccolomini
and
had
beforehand
promised
him
the
greatest
rewards
when
the
latter
to
conceal
his
amazement
at
this
extraordinary
communication
spoke
of
the
dangers
and
obstacles
which
would
oppose
so
hazardous
an
enterprise
wallenstein
ridiculed
his
fears
in
such
enterprises
he
maintained
nothing
was
difficult
but
the
commencement
the
stars
were
propitious
to
him
the
opportunity
the
best
that
could
be
wished
for
and
something
must
always
be
trusted
to
fortune
his
resolution
was
taken
and
if
it
could
not
be
otherwise
he
would
encounter
the
hazard
at
the
head
of
a
thousand
horse
piccolomini
was
careful
not
to
excite
wallenstein
suspicions
by
longer
opposition
and
yielded
apparently
to
the
force
of
his
reasoning
such
was
the
infatuation
of
the
duke
that
notwithstanding
the
warnings
of
count
terzky
he
never
doubted
the
sincerity
of
this
man
who
lost
not
a
moment
in
communicating
to
the
court
at
vienna
this
important
conversation
preparatory
to
taking
the
last
decisive
step
he
in
january
called
a
meeting
of
all
the
commanders
of
the
army
at
pilsen
whither
he
had
marched
after
his
retreat
from
bavaria
the
recent
orders
to
spare
his
hereditary
dominions
from
winter
quarterings
to
recover
ratisbon
in
the
middle
of
winter
and
to
reduce
the
army
by
a
detachment
of
six
thousand
horse
to
the
cardinal
infante
were
matters
sufficiently
grave
to
be
laid
before
a
council
of
war
and
this
plausible
pretext
served
to
conceal
from
the
curious
the
real
object
of
the
meeting
sweden
and
saxony
received
invitations
to
be
present
in
order
to
treat
with
the
duke
of
friedland
for
a
peace
to
the
leaders
of
more
distant
armies
written
communications
were
made
of
the
commanders
thus
summoned
twenty
appeared
but
three
most
influential
gallas
colloredo
and
altringer
were
absent
the
duke
reiterated
his
summons
to
them
and
in
the
mean
time
in
expectation
of
their
speedy
arrival
proceeded
to
execute
his
designs
it
was
no
light
task
that
he
had
to
perform
a
nobleman
proud
brave
and
jealous
of
his
honour
was
to
declare
himself
capable
of
the
basest
treachery
in
the
very
presence
of
those
who
had
been
accustomed
to
regard
him
as
the
representative
of
majesty
the
judge
of
their
actions
and
the
supporter
of
their
laws
and
to
show
himself
suddenly
as
a
traitor
a
cheat
and
a
rebel
it
was
no
easy
task
either
to
shake
to
its
foundations
a
legitimate
sovereignty
strengthened
by
time
and
consecrated
by
laws
and
religion
to
dissolve
all
the
charms
of
the
senses
and
the
imagination
those
formidable
guardians
of
an
established
throne
and
to
attempt
forcibly
to
uproot
those
invincible
feelings
of
duty
which
plead
so
loudly
and
so
powerfully
in
the
breast
of
the
subject
in
favour
of
his
sovereign
but
blinded
by
the
splendour
of
a
crown
wallenstein
observed
not
the
precipice
that
yawned
beneath
his
feet
and
in
full
reliance
on
his
own
strength
the
common
case
with
energetic
and
daring
minds
he
stopped
not
to
consider
the
magnitude
and
the
number
of
the
difficulties
that
opposed
him
wallenstein
saw
nothing
but
an
army
partly
indifferent
and
partly
exasperated
against
the
court
accustomed
with
a
blind
submission
to
do
homage
to
his
great
name
to
bow
to
him
as
their
legislator
and
judge
and
with
trembling
reverence
to
follow
his
orders
as
the
decrees
of
fate
in
the
extravagant
flatteries
which
were
paid
to
his
omnipotence
in
the
bold
abuse
of
the
court
government
in
which
a
lawless
soldiery
indulged
and
which
the
wild
licence
of
the
camp
excused
he
thought
he
read
the
sentiments
of
the
army
and
the
boldness
with
which
they
were
ready
to
censure
the
monarch
measures
passed
with
him
for
a
readiness
to
renounce
their
allegiance
to
a
sovereign
so
little
respected
but
that
which
he
had
regarded
as
the
lightest
matter
proved
the
most
formidable
obstacle
with
which
he
had
to
contend
the
soldiers
feelings
of
allegiance
were
the
rock
on
which
his
hopes
were
wrecked
deceived
by
the
profound
respect
in
which
he
was
held
by
these
lawless
bands
he
ascribed
the
whole
to
his
own
personal
greatness
without
distinguishing
how
much
he
owed
to
himself
and
how
much
to
the
dignity
with
which
he
was
invested
all
trembled
before
him
while
he
exercised
a
legitimate
authority
while
obedience
to
him
was
a
duty
and
while
his
consequence
was
supported
by
the
majesty
of
the
sovereign
greatness
in
and
of
itself
may
excite
terror
and
admiration
but
legitimate
greatness
alone
can
inspire
reverence
and
submission
and
of
this
decisive
advantage
he
deprived
himself
the
instant
he
avowed
himself
a
traitor
illo
undertook
to
learn
the
sentiments
of
the
officers
and
to
prepare
them
for
the
step
which
was
expected
of
them
he
began
by
laying
before
them
the
new
orders
of
the
court
to
the
general
and
the
army
and
by
the
obnoxious
turn
he
skilfully
gave
to
them
he
found
it
easy
to
excite
the
indignation
of
the
assembly
after
this
well
chosen
introduction
he
expatiated
with
much
eloquence
upon
the
merits
of
the
army
and
the
general
and
the
ingratitude
with
which
the
emperor
was
accustomed
to
requite
them
spanish
influence
he
maintained
governed
the
court
the
ministry
were
in
the
pay
of
spain
the
duke
of
friedland
alone
had
hitherto
opposed
this
tyranny
and
had
thus
drawn
down
upon
himself
the
deadly
enmity
of
the
spaniards
to
remove
him
from
the
command
or
to
make
away
with
him
entirely
he
continued
had
long
been
the
end
of
their
desires
and
until
they
could
succeed
in
one
or
other
they
endeavoured
to
abridge
his
power
in
the
field
the
command
was
to
be
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
king
of
hungary
for
no
other
reason
than
the
better
to
promote
the
spanish
power
in
germany
because
this
prince
as
the
ready
instrument
of
foreign
counsels
might
be
led
at
pleasure
it
was
merely
with
the
view
of
weakening
the
army
that
the
six
thousand
troops
were
required
for
the
cardinal
infante
it
was
solely
for
the
purpose
of
harassing
it
by
a
winter
campaign
that
they
were
now
called
on
in
this
inhospitable
season
to
undertake
the
recovery
of
ratisbon
the
means
of
subsistence
were
everywhere
rendered
difficult
while
the
jesuits
and
the
ministry
enriched
themselves
with
the
sweat
of
the
provinces
and
squandered
the
money
intended
for
the
pay
of
the
troops
the
general
abandoned
by
the
court
acknowledges
his
inability
to
keep
his
engagements
to
the
army
for
all
the
services
which
for
two
and
twenty
years
he
had
rendered
the
house
of
austria
for
all
the
difficulties
with
which
he
had
struggled
for
all
the
treasures
of
his
own
which
he
had
expended
in
the
imperial
service
a
second
disgraceful
dismissal
awaited
him
but
he
was
resolved
the
matter
should
not
come
to
this
he
was
determined
voluntarily
to
resign
the
command
before
it
should
be
wrested
from
his
hands
and
this
continued
the
orator
is
what
through
me
he
now
makes
known
to
his
officers
it
was
now
for
them
to
say
whether
it
would
be
advisable
to
lose
such
a
general
let
each
consider
who
was
to
refund
him
the
sums
he
had
expended
in
the
emperor
service
and
where
he
was
now
to
reap
the
reward
of
their
bravery
when
he
who
was
their
evidence
removed
from
the
scene
a
universal
cry
that
they
would
not
allow
their
general
to
be
taken
from
them
interrupted
the
speaker
four
of
the
principal
officers
were
deputed
to
lay
before
him
the
wish
of
the
assembly
and
earnestly
to
request
that
he
would
not
leave
the
army
the
duke
made
a
show
of
resistance
and
only
yielded
after
the
second
deputation
this
concession
on
his
side
seemed
to
demand
a
return
on
theirs
as
he
engaged
not
to
quit
the
service
without
the
knowledge
and
consent
of
the
generals
he
required
of
them
on
the
other
hand
a
written
promise
to
truly
and
firmly
adhere
to
him
neither
to
separate
nor
to
allow
themselves
to
be
separated
from
him
and
to
shed
their
last
drop
of
blood
in
his
defence
whoever
should
break
this
covenant
was
to
be
regarded
as
a
perfidious
traitor
and
treated
by
the
rest
as
a
common
enemy
the
express
condition
which
was
added
as
long
as
wallenstein
shall
employ
the
army
in
the
emperor
service
seemed
to
exclude
all
misconception
and
none
of
the
assembled
generals
hesitated
at
once
to
accede
to
a
demand
apparently
so
innocent
and
so
reasonable
this
document
was
publicly
read
before
an
entertainment
which
illo
had
expressly
prepared
for
the
purpose
it
was
to
be
signed
after
they
rose
from
table
the
host
did
his
utmost
to
stupify
his
guests
by
strong
potations
and
it
was
not
until
he
saw
them
affected
with
the
wine
that
he
produced
the
paper
for
signature
most
of
them
wrote
their
names
without
knowing
what
they
were
subscribing
a
few
only
more
curious
or
more
distrustful
read
the
paper
over
again
and
discovered
with
astonishment
that
the
clause
as
long
as
wallenstein
shall
employ
the
army
for
the
emperor
service
was
omitted
illo
had
in
fact
artfully
contrived
to
substitute
for
the
first
another
copy
in
which
these
words
were
wanting
the
trick
was
manifest
and
many
refused
now
to
sign
piccolomini
who
had
seen
through
the
whole
cheat
and
had
been
present
at
this
scene
merely
with
the
view
of
giving
information
of
the
whole
to
the
court
forgot
himself
so
far
in
his
cups
as
to
drink
the
emperor
health
but
count
terzky
now
rose
and
declared
that
all
were
perjured
villains
who
should
recede
from
their
engagement
his
menaces
the
idea
of
the
inevitable
danger
to
which
they
who
resisted
any
longer
would
be
exposed
the
example
of
the
rest
and
illo
rhetoric
at
last
overcame
their
scruples
and
the
paper
was
signed
by
all
without
exception
wallenstein
had
now
effected
his
purpose
but
the
unexpected
resistance
he
had
met
with
from
the
commanders
roused
him
at
last
from
the
fond
illusions
in
which
he
had
hitherto
indulged
besides
most
of
the
names
were
scrawled
so
illegibly
that
some
deceit
was
evidently
intended
but
instead
of
being
recalled
to
his
discretion
by
this
warning
he
gave
vent
to
his
injured
pride
in
undignified
complaints
and
reproaches
he
assembled
the
generals
the
next
day
and
undertook
personally
to
confirm
the
whole
tenor
of
the
agreement
which
illo
had
submitted
to
them
the
day
before
after
pouring
out
the
bitterest
reproaches
and
abuse
against
the
court
he
reminded
them
of
their
opposition
to
the
proposition
of
the
previous
day
and
declared
that
this
circumstance
had
induced
him
to
retract
his
own
promise
the
generals
withdrew
in
silence
and
confusion
but
after
a
short
consultation
in
the
antichamber
they
returned
to
apologize
for
their
late
conduct
and
offered
to
sign
the
paper
anew
nothing
now
remained
but
to
obtain
a
similar
assurance
from
the
absent
generals
or
on
their
refusal
to
seize
their
persons
wallenstein
renewed
his
invitation
to
them
and
earnestly
urged
them
to
hasten
their
arrival
but
a
rumour
of
the
doings
at
pilsen
reached
them
on
their
journey
and
suddenly
stopped
their
further
progress
altringer
on
pretence
of
sickness
remained
in
the
strong
fortress
of
frauenberg
gallas
made
his
appearance
but
merely
with
the
design
of
better
qualifying
himself
as
an
eyewitness
to
keep
the
emperor
informed
of
all
wallenstein
proceedings
the
intelligence
which
he
and
piccolomini
gave
at
once
converted
the
suspicions
of
the
court
into
an
alarming
certainty
similar
disclosures
which
were
at
the
same
time
made
from
other
quarters
left
no
room
for
farther
doubt
and
the
sudden
change
of
the
commanders
in
austria
and
silesia
appeared
to
be
the
prelude
to
some
important
enterprise
the
danger
was
pressing
and
the
remedy
must
be
speedy
but
the
court
was
unwilling
to
proceed
at
once
to
the
execution
of
the
sentence
till
the
regular
forms
of
justice
were
complied
with
secret
instructions
were
therefore
issued
to
the
principal
officers
on
whose
fidelity
reliance
could
be
placed
to
seize
the
persons
of
the
duke
of
friedland
and
of
his
two
associates
illo
and
terzky
and
keep
them
in
close
confinement
till
they
should
have
an
opportunity
of
being
heard
and
of
answering
for
their
conduct
but
if
this
could
not
be
accomplished
quietly
the
public
danger
required
that
they
should
be
taken
dead
or
live
at
the
same
time
general
gallas
received
a
patent
commission
by
which
these
orders
of
the
emperor
were
made
known
to
the
colonels
and
officers
and
the
army
was
released
from
its
obedience
to
the
traitor
and
placed
under
gallas
till
a
new
generalissimo
could
be
appointed
in
order
to
bring
back
the
seduced
and
deluded
to
their
duty
and
not
to
drive
the
guilty
to
despair
a
general
amnesty
was
proclaimed
in
regard
to
all
offences
against
the
imperial
majesty
committed
at
pilsen
general
gallas
was
not
pleased
with
the
honour
which
was
done
him
he
was
at
pilsen
under
the
eye
of
the
person
whose
fate
he
was
to
dispose
of
in
the
power
of
an
enemy
who
had
a
hundred
eyes
to
watch
his
motions
if
wallenstein
once
discovered
the
secret
of
his
commission
nothing
could
save
him
from
the
effects
of
his
vengeance
and
despair
but
if
it
was
thus
dangerous
to
be
the
secret
depositary
of
such
a
commission
how
much
more
so
to
execute
it
the
sentiments
of
the
generals
were
uncertain
and
it
was
at
least
doubtful
whether
after
the
step
they
had
taken
they
would
be
ready
to
trust
the
emperor
promises
and
at
once
to
abandon
the
brilliant
expectations
they
had
built
upon
wallenstein
enterprise
it
was
also
hazardous
to
attempt
to
lay
hands
on
the
person
of
a
man
who
till
now
had
been
considered
inviolable
who
from
long
exercise
of
supreme
power
and
from
habitual
obedience
had
become
the
object
of
deepest
respect
who
was
invested
with
every
attribute
of
outward
majesty
and
inward
greatness
whose
very
aspect
inspired
terror
and
who
by
a
nod
disposed
of
life
and
death
to
seize
such
a
man
like
a
common
criminal
in
the
midst
of
the
guards
by
whom
he
was
surrounded
and
in
a
city
apparently
devoted
to
him
to
convert
the
object
of
this
deep
and
habitual
veneration
into
a
subject
of
compassion
or
of
contempt
was
a
commission
calculated
to
make
even
the
boldest
hesitate
so
deeply
was
fear
and
veneration
for
their
general
engraven
in
the
breasts
of
the
soldiers
that
even
the
atrocious
crime
of
high
treason
could
not
wholly
eradicate
these
sentiments
gallas
perceived
the
impossibility
of
executing
his
commission
under
the
eyes
of
the
duke
and
his
most
anxious
wish
was
before
venturing
on
any
steps
to
have
an
interview
with
altringer
as
the
long
absence
of
the
latter
had
already
begun
to
excite
the
duke
suspicions
gallas
offered
to
repair
in
person
to
frauenberg
and
to
prevail
on
altringer
his
relation
to
return
with
him
wallenstein
was
so
pleased
with
this
proof
of
his
zeal
that
he
even
lent
him
his
own
equipage
for
the
journey
rejoicing
at
the
success
of
his
stratagem
he
left
pilsen
without
delay
leaving
to
count
piccolomini
the
task
of
watching
wallenstein
further
movements
he
did
not
fail
as
he
went
along
to
make
use
of
the
imperial
patent
and
the
sentiments
of
the
troops
proved
more
favourable
than
he
had
expected
instead
of
taking
back
his
friend
to
pilsen
he
despatched
him
to
vienna
to
warn
the
emperor
against
the
intended
attack
while
he
himself
repaired
to
upper
austria
of
which
the
safety
was
threatened
by
the
near
approach
of
duke
bernard
in
bohemia
the
towns
of
budweiss
and
tabor
were
again
garrisoned
for
the
emperor
and
every
precaution
taken
to
oppose
with
energy
the
designs
of
the
traitor
as
gallas
did
not
appear
disposed
to
return
piccolomini
determined
to
put
wallenstein
credulity
once
more
to
the
test
he
begged
to
be
sent
to
bring
back
gallas
and
wallenstein
suffered
himself
a
second
time
to
be
overreached
this
inconceivable
blindness
can
only
be
accounted
for
as
the
result
of
his
pride
which
never
retracted
the
opinion
it
had
once
formed
of
any
person
and
would
not
acknowledge
even
to
itself
the
possibility
of
being
deceived
he
conveyed
count
piccolomini
in
his
own
carriage
to
lintz
where
the
latter
immediately
followed
the
example
of
gallas
and
even
went
a
step
farther
he
had
promised
the
duke
to
return
he
did
so
but
it
was
at
the
head
of
an
army
intending
to
surprise
the
duke
in
pilsen
another
army
under
general
suys
hastened
to
prague
to
secure
that
capital
in
its
allegiance
and
to
defend
it
against
the
rebels
gallas
at
the
same
time
announced
himself
to
the
different
imperial
armies
as
the
from
whom
they
were
henceforth
to
receive
orders
placards
were
circulated
through
all
the
imperial
camps
denouncing
the
duke
and
his
four
confidants
and
absolving
the
soldiers
from
all
obedience
to
him
the
example
which
had
been
set
at
lintz
was
universally
followed
imprecations
were
showered
on
the
traitor
and
he
was
forsaken
by
all
the
armies
at
last
when
even
piccolomini
returned
no
more
the
mist
fell
from
wallenstein
eyes
and
in
consternation
he
awoke
from
his
dream
yet
his
faith
in
the
truth
of
astrology
and
in
the
fidelity
of
the
army
was
unshaken
immediately
after
the
intelligence
of
piccolomini
defection
he
issued
orders
that
in
future
no
commands
were
to
be
obeyed
which
did
not
proceed
directly
from
himself
or
from
terzky
or
illo
he
prepared
in
all
haste
to
advance
upon
prague
where
he
intended
to
throw
off
the
mask
and
openly
to
declare
against
the
emperor
all
the
troops
were
to
assemble
before
that
city
and
from
thence
to
pour
down
with
rapidity
upon
austria
duke
bernard
who
had
joined
the
conspiracy
was
to
support
the
operations
of
the
duke
with
the
swedish
troops
and
to
effect
a
diversion
upon
the
danube
terzky
was
already
upon
his
march
towards
prague
and
nothing
but
the
want
of
horses
prevented
the
duke
from
following
him
with
the
regiments
who
still
adhered
faithfully
to
him
but
when
with
the
most
anxious
expectation
he
awaited
the
intelligence
from
prague
he
suddenly
received
information
of
the
loss
of
that
town
the
defection
of
his
generals
the
desertion
of
his
troops
the
discovery
of
his
whole
plot
and
the
rapid
advance
of
piccolomini
who
was
sworn
to
his
destruction
suddenly
and
fearfully
had
all
his
projects
been
ruined
all
his
hopes
annihilated
he
stood
alone
abandoned
by
all
to
whom
he
had
been
a
benefactor
betrayed
by
all
on
whom
he
had
depended
but
it
is
under
such
circumstances
that
great
minds
reveal
themselves
though
deceived
in
all
his
expectations
he
refused
to
abandon
one
of
his
designs
he
despaired
of
nothing
so
long
as
life
remained
the
time
was
now
come
when
he
absolutely
required
that
assistance
which
he
had
so
often
solicited
from
the
swedes
and
the
saxons
and
when
all
doubts
of
the
sincerity
of
his
purposes
must
be
dispelled
and
now
when
oxenstiern
and
arnheim
were
convinced
of
the
sincerity
of
his
intentions
and
were
aware
of
his
necessities
they
no
longer
hesitated
to
embrace
the
favourable
opportunity
and
to
offer
him
their
protection
on
the
part
of
saxony
the
duke
francis
albert
of
saxe
lauenberg
was
to
join
him
with
men
and
duke
bernard
and
the
palatine
christian
of
birkenfeld
with
from
sweden
all
chosen
troops
wallenstein
left
pilsen
with
terzky
regiment
and
the
few
who
either
were
or
pretended
to
be
faithful
to
him
and
hastened
to
egra
on
the
frontiers
of
the
kingdom
in
order
to
be
near
the
upper
palatinate
and
to
facilitate
his
junction
with
duke
bernard
he
was
not
yet
informed
of
the
decree
by
which
he
was
proclaimed
a
public
enemy
and
traitor
this
awaited
him
at
egra
he
still
reckoned
on
the
army
which
general
schafgotsch
was
preparing
for
him
in
silesia
and
flattered
himself
with
the
hope
that
many
even
of
those
who
had
forsaken
him
would
return
with
the
first
dawning
of
success
even
during
his
flight
to
egra
so
little
humility
had
he
learned
from
melancholy
experience
he
was
still
occupied
with
the
colossal
scheme
of
dethroning
the
emperor
it
was
under
these
circumstances
that
one
of
his
suite
asked
leave
to
offer
him
his
advice
under
the
emperor
said
he
your
highness
is
certain
of
being
a
great
and
respected
noble
with
the
enemy
you
are
at
best
but
a
precarious
king
it
is
unwise
to
risk
certainty
for
uncertainty
the
enemy
will
avail
themselves
of
your
personal
influence
while
the
opportunity
lasts
but
you
will
ever
be
regarded
with
suspicion
and
they
will
always
be
fearful
lest
you
should
treat
them
as
you
have
done
the
emperor
return
then
to
your
allegiance
while
there
is
yet
time
and
how
is
that
to
be
done
said
wallenstein
interrupting
him
you
have
rejoined
he
meaning
ducats
which
were
stamped
with
the
figure
of
an
armed
man
take
them
with
you
and
go
straight
to
the
imperial
court
then
declare
that
the
steps
you
have
hitherto
taken
were
merely
designed
to
test
the
fidelity
of
the
emperor
servants
and
of
distinguishing
the
loyal
from
the
doubtful
and
since
most
have
shown
a
disposition
to
revolt
say
you
are
come
to
warn
his
imperial
majesty
against
those
dangerous
men
thus
you
will
make
those
appear
as
traitors
who
are
labouring
to
represent
you
as
a
false
villain
at
the
imperial
court
a
man
is
sure
to
be
welcome
with
ducats
and
friedland
will
be
again
as
he
was
at
the
first
the
advice
is
good
said
wallenstein
after
a
pause
but
let
the
devil
trust
to
it
while
the
duke
in
his
retirement
in
egra
was
energetically
pushing
his
negociations
with
the
enemy
consulting
the
stars
and
indulging
in
new
hopes
the
dagger
which
was
to
put
an
end
to
his
existence
was
unsheathed
almost
under
his
very
eyes
the
imperial
decree
which
proclaimed
him
an
outlaw
had
not
failed
of
its
effect
and
an
avenging
nemesis
ordained
that
the
ungrateful
should
fall
beneath
the
blow
of
ingratitude
among
his
officers
wallenstein
had
particularly
distinguished
one
an
irishman
and
had
made
his
fortune
this
was
the
man
who
now
felt
himself
called
on
to
execute
the
sentence
against
him
and
to
earn
the
price
of
blood
no
sooner
had
he
reached
egra
in
the
suite
of
the
duke
than
he
disclosed
to
the
commandant
of
the
town
colonel
buttler
and
to
gordon
two
protestant
scotchmen
the
treasonable
designs
of
the
duke
which
the
latter
had
imprudently
enough
communicated
to
him
during
the
journey
in
these
two
individuals
he
had
found
men
capable
of
a
determined
resolution
they
were
now
called
on
to
choose
between
treason
and
duty
between
their
legitimate
sovereign
and
a
fugitive
abandoned
rebel
and
though
the
latter
was
their
common
benefactor
the
choice
could
not
remain
for
a
moment
doubtful
they
were
solemnly
pledged
to
the
allegiance
of
the
emperor
and
this
duty
required
them
to
take
the
most
rapid
measures
against
the
public
enemy
the
opportunity
was
favourable
his
evil
genius
seemed
to
have
delivered
him
into
the
hands
of
vengeance
but
not
to
encroach
on
the
province
of
justice
they
resolved
to
deliver
up
their
victim
alive
and
they
parted
with
the
bold
resolve
to
take
their
general
prisoner
this
dark
plot
was
buried
in
the
deepest
silence
and
wallenstein
far
from
suspecting
his
impending
ruin
flattered
himself
that
in
the
garrison
of
egra
he
possessed
his
bravest
and
most
faithful
champions
schiller
is
mistaken
as
to
this
point
leslie
was
a
scotchman
and
buttler
an
irishman
and
a
papist
he
died
a
general
in
the
emperor
service
and
founded
at
prague
a
convent
of
irish
franciscans
which
still
exists
at
this
time
he
became
acquainted
with
the
imperial
proclamations
containing
his
sentence
and
which
had
been
published
in
all
the
camps
he
now
became
aware
of
the
full
extent
of
the
danger
which
encompassed
him
the
utter
impossibility
of
retracing
his
steps
his
fearfully
forlorn
condition
and
the
absolute
necessity
of
at
once
trusting
himself
to
the
faith
and
honour
of
the
emperor
enemies
to
leslie
he
poured
forth
all
the
anguish
of
his
wounded
spirit
and
the
vehemence
of
his
agitation
extracted
from
him
his
last
remaining
secret
he
disclosed
to
this
officer
his
intention
to
deliver
up
egra
and
ellenbogen
the
passes
of
the
kingdom
to
the
palatine
of
birkenfeld
and
at
the
same
time
informed
him
of
the
near
approach
of
duke
bernard
of
whose
arrival
he
hoped
to
receive
tidings
that
very
night
these
disclosures
which
leslie
immediately
communicated
to
the
conspirators
made
them
change
their
original
plan
the
urgency
of
the
danger
admitted
not
of
half
measures
egra
might
in
a
moment
be
in
the
enemy
hands
and
a
sudden
revolution
set
their
prisoner
at
liberty
to
anticipate
this
mischance
they
resolved
to
assassinate
him
and
his
associates
the
following
night
in
order
to
execute
this
design
with
less
noise
it
was
arranged
that
the
fearful
deed
should
be
perpetrated
at
an
entertainment
which
colonel
buttler
should
give
in
the
castle
of
egra
all
the
guests
except
wallenstein
made
their
appearance
who
being
in
too
great
anxiety
of
mind
to
enjoy
company
excused
himself
with
regard
to
him
therefore
their
plan
must
be
again
changed
but
they
resolved
to
execute
their
design
against
the
others
the
three
colonels
illo
terzky
and
william
kinsky
came
in
with
careless
confidence
and
with
them
captain
neumann
an
officer
of
ability
whose
advice
terzky
sought
in
every
intricate
affair
previous
to
their
arrival
trusty
soldiers
of
the
garrison
to
whom
the
plot
had
been
communicated
were
admitted
into
the
castle
all
the
avenues
leading
from
it
guarded
and
six
of
buttler
dragoons
concealed
in
an
apartment
close
to
the
who
on
a
concerted
signal
were
to
rush
in
and
kill
the
traitors
without
suspecting
the
danger
that
hung
over
them
the
guests
gaily
abandoned
themselves
to
the
pleasures
of
the
table
and
wallenstein
health
was
drunk
in
full
bumpers
not
as
a
servant
of
the
emperor
but
as
a
sovereign
prince
the
wine
opened
their
hearts
and
illo
with
exultation
boasted
that
in
three
days
an
army
would
arrive
such
as
wallenstein
had
never
before
been
at
the
head
of
yes
cried
neumann
and
then
he
hopes
to
bathe
his
hands
in
austrian
blood
during
this
conversation
the
dessert
was
brought
in
and
leslie
gave
the
concerted
signal
to
raise
the
drawbridges
while
he
himself
received
the
keys
of
the
gates
in
an
instant
the
hall
was
filled
with
armed
men
who
with
the
unexpected
greeting
of
long
live
ferdinand
placed
themselves
behind
the
chairs
of
the
marked
guests
surprised
and
with
a
presentiment
of
their
fate
they
sprang
from
the
table
kinsky
and
terzky
were
killed
upon
the
spot
and
before
they
could
put
themselves
upon
their
guard
neumann
during
the
confusion
in
the
hall
escaped
into
the
court
where
however
he
was
instantly
recognised
and
cut
down
illo
alone
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
defend
himself
he
placed
his
back
against
a
window
from
whence
he
poured
the
bitterest
reproaches
upon
gordon
and
challenged
him
to
fight
him
fairly
and
honourably
after
a
gallant
resistance
in
which
he
slew
two
of
his
assailants
he
fell
to
the
ground
overpowered
by
numbers
and
pierced
with
ten
wounds
the
deed
was
no
sooner
accomplished
than
leslie
hastened
into
the
town
to
prevent
a
tumult
the
sentinels
at
the
castle
gate
seeing
him
running
and
out
of
breath
and
believing
he
belonged
to
the
rebels
fired
their
muskets
after
him
but
without
effect
the
firing
however
aroused
the
and
all
leslie
presence
of
mind
was
requisite
to
allay
the
tumult
he
hastily
detailed
to
them
all
the
circumstances
of
wallenstein
conspiracy
the
measures
which
had
been
already
taken
to
counteract
it
the
fate
of
the
four
rebels
as
well
as
that
which
awaited
their
chief
finding
the
troops
well
disposed
he
exacted
from
them
a
new
oath
of
fidelity
to
the
emperor
and
to
live
and
die
for
the
good
cause
a
hundred
of
buttler
dragoons
were
sent
from
the
castle
into
the
town
to
patrol
the
streets
to
overawe
the
partisans
of
the
duke
and
to
prevent
tumult
all
the
gates
of
egra
were
at
the
same
time
seized
and
every
avenue
to
wallenstein
residence
which
adjoined
the
guarded
by
a
numerous
and
trusty
body
of
troops
sufficient
to
prevent
either
his
escape
or
his
receiving
any
assistance
from
without
but
before
they
proceeded
finally
to
execute
the
deed
a
long
conference
was
held
among
the
conspirators
in
the
castle
whether
they
should
kill
him
or
content
themselves
with
making
him
prisoner
besprinkled
as
they
were
with
the
blood
and
deliberating
almost
over
the
very
corpses
of
his
murdered
associates
even
these
furious
men
yet
shuddered
at
the
horror
of
taking
away
so
illustrious
a
life
they
saw
before
their
mind
eye
him
their
leader
in
battle
in
the
days
of
his
good
fortune
surrounded
by
his
victorious
army
clothed
with
all
the
pomp
of
military
greatness
and
awe
again
seized
their
minds
but
this
transitory
emotion
was
soon
effaced
by
the
thought
of
the
immediate
danger
they
remembered
the
hints
which
neumann
and
illo
had
thrown
out
at
table
the
near
approach
of
a
formidable
army
of
swedes
and
saxons
and
they
clearly
saw
that
the
death
of
the
traitor
was
their
only
chance
of
safety
they
adhered
therefore
to
their
first
resolution
and
captain
deveroux
an
irishman
who
had
already
been
retained
for
the
murderous
purpose
received
decisive
orders
to
act
while
these
three
officers
were
thus
deciding
upon
his
fate
in
the
castle
of
egra
wallenstein
was
occupied
in
reading
the
stars
with
seni
the
danger
is
not
yet
over
said
the
astrologer
with
prophetic
spirit
it
is
replied
the
duke
who
would
give
the
law
even
to
heaven
but
he
continued
with
equally
prophetic
spirit
that
thou
friend
seni
thyself
shall
soon
be
thrown
into
prison
that
also
is
written
in
the
stars
the
astrologer
had
taken
his
leave
and
wallenstein
had
retired
to
bed
when
captain
deveroux
appeared
before
his
residence
with
six
halberdiers
and
was
immediately
admitted
by
the
guard
who
were
accustomed
to
see
him
visit
the
general
at
all
hours
a
page
who
met
him
upon
the
stairs
and
attempted
to
raise
an
alarm
was
run
through
the
body
with
a
pike
in
the
antichamber
the
assassins
met
a
servant
who
had
just
come
out
of
the
of
his
master
and
had
taken
with
him
the
key
putting
his
finger
upon
his
mouth
the
terrified
domestic
made
a
sign
to
them
to
make
no
noise
as
the
duke
was
asleep
friend
cried
deveroux
it
is
time
to
awake
him
and
with
these
words
he
rushed
against
the
door
which
was
also
bolted
from
within
and
burst
it
open
wallenstein
had
been
roused
from
his
first
sleep
by
the
report
of
a
musket
which
had
accidentally
gone
off
and
had
sprung
to
the
window
to
call
the
guard
at
the
same
moment
he
heard
from
the
adjoining
building
the
shrieks
of
the
countesses
terzky
and
kinsky
who
had
just
learnt
the
violent
fate
of
their
husbands
ere
he
had
time
to
reflect
on
these
terrible
events
deveroux
with
the
other
murderers
was
in
his
chamber
the
duke
was
in
his
shirt
as
he
had
leaped
out
of
bed
and
leaning
on
a
table
near
the
window
art
thou
the
villain
cried
deveroux
to
him
who
intends
to
deliver
up
the
emperor
troops
to
the
enemy
and
to
tear
the
crown
from
the
head
of
his
majesty
now
thou
must
die
he
paused
for
a
few
moments
as
if
expecting
an
answer
but
scorn
and
astonishment
kept
wallenstein
silent
throwing
his
arms
wide
open
he
received
in
his
breast
the
deadly
blow
of
the
halberds
and
without
uttering
a
groan
fell
weltering
in
his
blood
the
next
day
an
express
arrived
from
the
duke
of
lauenburg
announcing
his
approach
the
messenger
was
secured
and
another
in
wallenstein
livery
despatched
to
the
duke
to
decoy
him
into
egra
the
stratagem
succeeded
and
francis
albert
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
duke
bernard
of
weimar
who
was
on
his
march
towards
egra
was
nearly
sharing
the
same
fate
fortunately
he
heard
of
wallenstein
death
in
time
to
save
himself
by
a
retreat
ferdinand
shed
a
tear
over
the
fate
of
his
general
and
ordered
three
thousand
masses
to
be
said
for
his
soul
at
vienna
but
at
the
same
time
he
did
not
forget
to
reward
his
assassins
with
gold
chains
chamberlains
keys
dignities
and
estates
thus
did
wallenstein
at
the
age
of
fifty
terminate
his
active
and
extraordinary
life
to
ambition
he
owed
both
his
greatness
and
his
ruin
with
all
his
failings
he
possessed
great
and
admirable
qualities
and
had
he
kept
himself
within
due
bounds
he
would
have
lived
and
died
without
an
equal
the
virtues
of
the
ruler
and
of
the
hero
prudence
justice
firmness
and
courage
are
strikingly
prominent
features
in
his
character
but
he
wanted
the
gentler
virtues
of
the
man
which
adorn
the
hero
and
make
the
ruler
beloved
terror
was
the
talisman
with
which
he
worked
extreme
in
his
punishments
as
in
his
rewards
he
knew
how
to
keep
alive
the
zeal
of
his
followers
while
no
general
of
ancient
or
modern
times
could
boast
of
being
obeyed
with
equal
alacrity
submission
to
his
will
was
more
prized
by
him
than
bravery
for
if
the
soldiers
work
by
the
latter
it
is
on
the
former
that
the
general
depends
he
continually
kept
up
the
obedience
of
his
troops
by
capricious
orders
and
profusely
rewarded
the
readiness
to
obey
even
in
trifles
because
he
looked
rather
to
the
act
itself
than
its
object
he
once
issued
a
decree
with
the
penalty
of
death
on
disobedience
that
none
but
red
sashes
should
be
worn
in
the
army
a
captain
of
horse
no
sooner
heard
the
order
than
pulling
off
his
sash
he
trampled
it
under
foot
wallenstein
on
being
informed
of
the
circumstance
promoted
him
on
the
spot
to
the
rank
of
colonel
his
comprehensive
glance
was
always
directed
to
the
whole
and
in
all
his
apparent
caprice
he
steadily
kept
in
view
some
general
scope
or
bearing
the
robberies
committed
by
the
soldiers
in
a
friendly
country
had
led
to
the
severest
orders
against
marauders
and
all
who
should
be
caught
thieving
were
threatened
with
the
halter
wallenstein
himself
having
met
a
straggler
in
the
open
country
upon
the
field
commanded
him
to
be
seized
without
trial
as
a
transgressor
of
the
law
and
in
his
usual
voice
of
thunder
exclaimed
hang
the
fellow
against
which
no
opposition
ever
availed
the
soldier
pleaded
and
proved
his
innocence
but
the
irrevocable
sentence
had
gone
forth
hang
then
innocent
cried
the
inexorable
wallenstein
the
guilty
will
have
then
more
reason
to
tremble
preparations
were
already
making
to
execute
the
sentence
when
the
soldier
who
gave
himself
up
for
lost
formed
the
desperate
resolution
of
not
dying
without
revenge
he
fell
furiously
upon
his
judge
but
was
overpowered
by
numbers
and
disarmed
before
he
could
fulfil
his
design
now
let
him
go
said
the
duke
it
will
excite
sufficient
terror
his
munificence
was
supported
by
an
immense
income
which
was
estimated
at
three
millions
of
florins
yearly
without
reckoning
the
enormous
sums
which
he
raised
under
the
name
of
contributions
his
liberality
and
clearness
of
understanding
raised
him
above
the
religious
prejudices
of
his
age
and
the
jesuits
never
forgave
him
for
having
seen
through
their
system
and
for
regarding
the
pope
as
nothing
more
than
a
bishop
of
rome
but
as
no
one
ever
yet
came
to
a
fortunate
end
who
quarrelled
with
the
church
wallenstein
also
must
augment
the
number
of
its
victims
through
the
intrigues
of
monks
he
lost
at
ratisbon
the
command
of
the
army
and
at
egra
his
life
by
the
same
arts
perhaps
he
lost
what
was
of
more
consequence
his
honourable
name
and
good
repute
with
posterity
for
in
justice
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
pens
which
have
traced
the
history
of
this
extraordinary
man
are
not
untinged
with
partiality
and
that
the
treachery
of
the
duke
and
his
designs
upon
the
throne
of
bohemia
rest
not
so
much
upon
proven
facts
as
upon
probable
conjecture
no
documents
have
yet
been
brought
to
light
which
disclose
with
historical
certainty
the
secret
motives
of
his
conduct
and
among
all
his
public
and
well
attested
actions
there
is
perhaps
not
one
which
could
not
have
had
an
innocent
end
many
of
his
most
obnoxious
measures
proved
nothing
but
the
earnest
wish
he
entertained
for
peace
most
of
the
others
are
explained
and
justified
by
the
distrust
he
entertained
of
the
emperor
and
the
excusable
wish
of
maintaining
his
own
importance
it
is
true
that
his
conduct
towards
the
elector
of
bavaria
looks
too
like
an
unworthy
revenge
and
the
dictates
of
an
implacable
spirit
but
still
none
of
his
actions
perhaps
warrant
us
in
holding
his
treason
to
be
proved
if
necessity
and
despair
at
last
forced
him
to
deserve
the
sentence
which
had
been
pronounced
against
him
while
innocent
still
this
if
true
will
not
justify
that
sentence
thus
wallenstein
fell
not
because
he
was
a
rebel
but
he
became
a
rebel
because
he
fell
unfortunate
in
life
that
he
made
a
victorious
party
his
enemy
and
still
more
unfortunate
in
death
that
the
same
party
survived
him
and
wrote
his
history
book
wallenstein
death
rendered
necessary
the
appointment
of
a
new
generalissimo
and
the
emperor
yielded
at
last
to
the
advice
of
the
spaniards
to
raise
his
son
ferdinand
king
of
hungary
to
that
dignity
under
him
count
gallas
commanded
who
performed
the
functions
of
while
the
prince
brought
to
this
post
nothing
but
his
name
and
dignity
a
considerable
force
was
soon
assembled
under
ferdinand
the
duke
of
lorraine
brought
up
a
considerable
body
of
auxiliaries
in
person
and
the
cardinal
infante
joined
him
from
italy
with
men
in
order
to
drive
the
enemy
from
the
danube
the
new
general
undertook
the
enterprise
in
which
his
predecessor
had
failed
the
siege
of
ratisbon
in
vain
did
duke
bernard
of
weimar
penetrate
into
the
interior
of
bavaria
with
a
view
to
draw
the
enemy
from
the
town
ferdinand
continued
to
press
the
siege
with
vigour
and
the
city
after
a
most
obstinate
resistance
was
obliged
to
open
its
gates
to
him
donauwerth
soon
shared
the
same
fate
and
nordlingen
in
swabia
was
now
invested
the
loss
of
so
many
of
the
imperial
cities
was
severely
felt
by
the
swedish
party
as
the
friendship
of
these
towns
had
so
largely
contributed
to
the
success
of
their
arms
indifference
to
their
fate
would
have
been
inexcusable
it
would
have
been
an
indelible
disgrace
had
they
deserted
their
confederates
in
their
need
and
abandoned
them
to
the
revenge
of
an
implacable
conqueror
moved
by
these
considerations
the
swedish
army
under
the
command
of
horn
and
bernard
of
weimar
advanced
upon
nordlingen
determined
to
relieve
it
even
at
the
expense
of
a
battle
the
undertaking
was
a
dangerous
one
for
in
numbers
the
enemy
was
greatly
superior
to
that
of
the
swedes
there
was
also
a
further
reason
for
avoiding
a
battle
at
present
the
enemy
force
was
likely
soon
to
divide
the
italian
troops
being
destined
for
the
netherlands
in
the
mean
time
such
a
position
might
be
taken
up
as
to
cover
nordlingen
and
cut
off
their
supplies
all
these
grounds
were
strongly
urged
by
gustavus
horn
in
the
swedish
council
of
war
but
his
remonstrances
were
disregarded
by
men
who
intoxicated
by
a
long
career
of
success
mistook
the
suggestions
of
prudence
for
the
voice
of
timidity
overborne
by
the
superior
influence
of
duke
bernard
gustavus
horn
was
compelled
to
risk
a
contest
whose
unfavourable
issue
a
dark
foreboding
seemed
already
to
announce
the
fate
of
the
battle
depended
upon
the
possession
of
a
height
which
commanded
the
imperial
camp
an
attempt
to
occupy
it
during
the
night
failed
as
the
tedious
transport
of
the
artillery
through
woods
and
hollow
ways
delayed
the
arrival
of
the
troops
when
the
swedes
arrived
about
midnight
they
found
the
heights
in
possession
of
the
enemy
strongly
entrenched
they
waited
therefore
for
daybreak
to
carry
them
by
storm
their
impetuous
courage
surmounted
every
obstacle
the
entrenchments
which
were
in
the
form
of
a
crescent
were
successfully
scaled
by
each
of
the
two
brigades
appointed
to
the
service
but
as
they
entered
at
the
same
moment
from
opposite
sides
they
met
and
threw
each
other
into
confusion
at
this
unfortunate
moment
a
barrel
of
powder
blew
up
and
created
the
greatest
disorder
among
the
swedes
the
imperial
cavalry
charged
upon
their
broken
ranks
and
the
flight
became
universal
no
persuasion
on
the
part
of
their
general
could
induce
the
fugitives
to
renew
the
assault
he
resolved
therefore
in
order
to
carry
this
important
post
to
lead
fresh
troops
to
the
attack
but
in
the
interim
some
spanish
regiments
had
marched
in
and
every
attempt
to
gain
it
was
repulsed
by
their
heroic
intrepidity
one
of
the
duke
own
regiments
advanced
seven
times
and
was
as
often
driven
back
the
disadvantage
of
not
occupying
this
post
in
time
was
quickly
and
sensibly
felt
the
fire
of
the
enemy
artillery
from
the
heights
caused
such
slaughter
in
the
adjacent
wing
of
the
swedes
that
horn
who
commanded
there
was
forced
to
give
orders
to
retire
instead
of
being
able
to
cover
the
retreat
of
his
colleague
and
to
check
the
pursuit
of
the
enemy
duke
bernard
overpowered
by
numbers
was
himself
driven
into
the
plain
where
his
routed
cavalry
spread
confusion
among
horn
brigade
and
rendered
the
defeat
complete
almost
the
entire
infantry
were
killed
or
taken
prisoners
more
than
men
remained
dead
upon
the
field
of
battle
field
pieces
about
waggons
and
standards
and
colours
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
imperialists
horn
himself
with
three
other
generals
were
taken
prisoners
duke
bernard
with
difficulty
saved
a
feeble
remnant
of
his
army
which
joined
him
at
frankfort
the
defeat
at
nordlingen
cost
the
swedish
chancellor
the
second
sleepless
night
he
had
passed
in
the
consequences
of
this
disaster
were
terrible
the
swedes
had
lost
by
it
at
once
their
superiority
in
the
field
and
with
it
the
confidence
of
their
confederates
which
they
had
gained
solely
by
their
previous
military
success
a
dangerous
division
threatened
the
protestant
confederation
with
ruin
consternation
and
terror
seized
upon
the
whole
party
while
the
papists
arose
with
exulting
triumph
from
the
deep
humiliation
into
which
they
had
sunk
swabia
and
the
adjacent
circles
first
felt
the
consequences
of
the
defeat
of
nordlingen
and
wirtemberg
in
particular
was
overrun
by
the
conquering
army
all
the
members
of
the
league
of
heilbronn
trembled
at
the
prospect
of
the
emperor
revenge
those
who
could
fled
to
strasburg
while
the
helpless
free
cities
awaited
their
fate
with
alarm
a
little
more
of
moderation
towards
the
conquered
would
have
quickly
reduced
all
the
weaker
states
under
the
emperor
authority
but
the
severity
which
was
practised
even
against
those
who
voluntarily
surrendered
drove
the
rest
to
despair
and
roused
them
to
a
vigorous
resistance
the
first
was
occasioned
by
the
death
of
gustavus
adolphus
in
this
perplexity
all
looked
to
oxenstiern
for
counsel
and
assistance
oxenstiern
applied
for
both

the
german
states
troops
were
wanted

the
men
were
clamorously
demanding
oxenstiern
addressed
himself
to
the
elector
of
saxony
but
he
shamefully
abandoned
the
swedish
cause
to
negociate
for
a
separate
peace
with
the
emperor
at
pirna
he
solicited
aid
from
the
lower
saxon
states
but
they
long
wearied
of
the
swedish
pretensions
and
demands
for
money
now
thought
only
of
themselves
and
george
duke
of
lunenburg
in
place
of
flying
to
the
assistance
of

laid
siege
to
minden
with
the
intention
of
keeping
possession
of
it
for
himself
abandoned
by
his
german
allies
the
chancellor
exerted
himself
to
obtain
the
assistance
of
foreign
powers
england
holland
and
venice
were
applied
to
for
troops
and
money
and
driven
to
the
last
extremity
the
chancellor
reluctantly
resolved
to
take
the
disagreeable
step
which
he
had
so
long
avoided
and
to
throw
himself
under
the
protection
of
france
the
moment
had
at
last
arrived
which
richelieu
had
long
waited
for
with
impatience
nothing
he
was
aware
but
the
impossibility
of
saving
themselves
by
any
other
means
could
induce
the
protestant
states
in
germany
to
support
the
pretensions
of
france
upon
alsace
this
extreme
necessity
had
now
arrived
the
assistance
of
that
power
was
indispensable
and
she
was
resolved
to
be
well
paid
for
the
active
part
which
she
was
about
to
take
in
the
german
war
full
of
lustre
and
dignity
it
now
came
upon
the
political
stage
oxenstiern
who
felt
little
reluctance
in
bestowing
the
rights
and
possessions
of
the
empire
had
already
ceded
the
fortress
of
philipsburg
and
the
other
long
coveted
places
the
protestants
of
upper
germany
now
in
their
own
names
sent
a
special
embassy
to
richelieu
requesting
him
to
take
alsace
the
fortress
of
breyssach
which
was
still
to
be
recovered
from
the
enemy
and
all
the
places
upon
the
upper
rhine
which
were
the
keys
of
germany
under
the
protection
of
france
what
was
implied
by
french
protection
had
been
seen
in
the
conduct
of
france
towards
the
bishoprics
of
metz
toul
and
verdun
which
it
had
held
for
centuries
against
the
rightful
owners
treves
was
already
in
the
possession
of
french
garrisons
lorraine
was
in
a
manner
conquered
as
it
might
at
any
time
be
overrun
by
an
army
and
could
not
alone
and
with
its
own
strength
withstand
its
formidable
neighbour
france
now
entertained
the
hope
of
adding
alsace
to
its
large
and
numerous
possessions
and
since
a
treaty
was
soon
to
be
concluded
with
the
dutch
for
the
partition
of
the
spanish
netherlands
the
prospect
of
making
the
rhine
its
natural
boundary
towards
germany
thus
shamefully
were
the
rights
of
germany
sacrificed
by
the
german
states
to
this
treacherous
and
grasping
power
which
under
the
mask
of
a
disinterested
friendship
aimed
only
at
its
own
aggrandizement
and
while
it
boldly
claimed
the
honourable
title
of
a
protectress
was
solely
occupied
with
promoting
its
own
schemes
and
advancing
its
own
interests
amid
the
general
confusion
in
return
for
these
important
cessions
france
engaged
to
effect
a
diversion
in
favour
of
the
swedes
by
commencing
hostilities
against
the
spaniards
and
if
this
should
lead
to
an
open
breach
with
the
emperor
to
maintain
an
army
upon
the
german
side
of
the
rhine
which
was
to
act
in
conjunction
with
the
swedes
and
germans
against
austria
for
a
war
with
spain
the
spaniards
themselves
soon
afforded
the
desired
pretext
making
an
inroad
from
the
netherlands
upon
the
city
of
treves
they
cut
in
pieces
the
french
garrison
and
in
open
violation
of
the
law
of
nations
made
prisoner
the
elector
who
had
placed
himself
under
the
protection
of
france
and
carried
him
into
flanders
when
the
cardinal
infante
as
viceroy
of
the
spanish
netherlands
refused
satisfaction
for
these
injuries
and
delayed
to
restore
the
prince
to
liberty
richelieu
after
the
old
custom
formally
proclaimed
war
at
brussels
by
a
herald
and
the
war
was
at
once
opened
by
three
different
armies
in
milan
in
the
valteline
and
in
flanders
the
french
minister
was
less
anxious
to
commence
hostilities
with
the
emperor
which
promised
fewer
advantages
and
threatened
greater
difficulties
a
fourth
army
however
was
detached
across
the
rhine
into
germany
under
the
command
of
cardinal
lavalette
which
was
to
act
in
conjunction
with
duke
bernard
against
the
emperor
without
a
previous
declaration
of
war
a
heavier
blow
for
the
swedes
than
even
the
defeat
of
nordlingen
was
the
reconciliation
of
the
elector
of
saxony
with
the
emperor
after
many
fruitless
attempts
both
to
bring
about
and
to
prevent
it
it
was
at
last
effected
in
at
pirna
and
the
following
year
reduced
into
a
formal
treaty
of
peace
at
prague
the
elector
of
saxony
had
always
viewed
with
jealousy
the
pretensions
of
the
swedes
in
germany
and
his
aversion
to
this
foreign
power
which
now
gave
laws
within
the
empire
had
grown
with
every
fresh
requisition
that
oxenstiern
was
obliged
to
make
upon
the
german
states
this
ill
feeling
was
kept
alive
by
the
spanish
court
who
laboured
earnestly
to
effect
a
peace
between
saxony
and
the
emperor
wearied
with
the
calamities
of
a
long
and
destructive
contest
which
had
selected
saxony
above
all
others
for
its
theatre
grieved
by
the
miseries
which
both
friend
and
foe
inflicted
upon
his
subjects
and
seduced
by
the
tempting
propositions
of
the
house
of
austria
the
elector
at
last
abandoned
the
common
cause
and
caring
little
for
the
fate
of
his
confederates
or
the
liberties
of
germany
thought
only
of
securing
his
own
advantages
even
at
the
expense
of
the
whole
body
in
fact
the
misery
of
germany
had
risen
to
such
a
height
that
all
clamorously
vociferated
for
peace
and
even
the
most
disadvantageous
pacification
would
have
been
hailed
as
a
blessing
from
heaven
the
plains
which
formerly
had
been
thronged
with
a
happy
and
industrious
population
where
nature
had
lavished
her
choicest
gifts
and
plenty
and
prosperity
had
reigned
were
now
a
wild
and
desolate
wilderness
the
fields
abandoned
by
the
industrious
husbandman
lay
waste
and
uncultivated
and
no
sooner
had
the
young
crops
given
the
promise
of
a
smiling
harvest
than
a
single
march
destroyed
the
labours
of
a
year
and
blasted
the
last
hope
of
an
afflicted
peasantry
burnt
castles
wasted
fields
villages
in
ashes
were
to
be
seen
extending
far
and
wide
on
all
sides
while
the
ruined
peasantry
had
no
resource
left
but
to
swell
the
horde
of
incendiaries
and
fearfully
to
retaliate
upon
their
fellows
who
had
hitherto
been
spared
the
miseries
which
they
themselves
had
suffered
the
only
safeguard
against
oppression
was
to
become
an
oppressor
the
towns
groaned
under
the
licentiousness
of
undisciplined
and
plundering
garrisons
who
seized
and
wasted
the
property
of
the
citizens
and
under
the
license
of
their
position
committed
the
most
remorseless
devastation
and
cruelty
if
the
march
of
an
army
converted
whole
provinces
into
deserts
if
others
were
impoverished
by
winter
quarters
or
exhausted
by
contributions
these
still
were
but
passing
evils
and
the
industry
of
a
year
might
efface
the
miseries
of
a
few
months
but
there
was
no
relief
for
those
who
had
a
garrison
within
their
walls
or
in
the
neighbourhood
even
the
change
of
fortune
could
not
improve
their
unfortunate
fate
since
the
victor
trod
in
the
steps
of
the
vanquished
and
friends
were
not
more
merciful
than
enemies
the
neglected
farms
the
destruction
of
the
crops
and
the
numerous
armies
which
overran
the
exhausted
country
were
inevitably
followed
by
scarcity
and
the
high
price
of
provisions
which
in
the
later
years
was
still
further
increased
by
a
general
failure
in
the
crops
the
crowding
together
of
men
in
camps
and
quarters
want
upon
one
side
and
excess
on
the
other
occasioned
contagious
distempers
which
were
more
fatal
than
even
the
sword
in
this
long
and
general
confusion
all
the
bonds
of
social
life
were
broken
up
respect
for
the
rights
of
their
fellow
men
the
fear
of
the
laws
purity
of
morals
honour
and
religion
were
laid
aside
where
might
ruled
supreme
with
iron
sceptre
under
the
shelter
of
anarchy
and
impunity
every
vice
flourished
and
men
became
as
wild
as
the
country
no
station
was
too
dignified
for
outrage
no
property
too
holy
for
rapine
and
avarice
in
a
word
the
soldier
reigned
supreme
and
that
most
brutal
of
despots
often
made
his
own
officer
feel
his
power
the
leader
of
an
army
was
a
far
more
important
person
within
any
country
where
he
appeared
than
its
lawful
governor
who
was
frequently
obliged
to
fly
before
him
into
his
own
castles
for
safety
germany
swarmed
with
these
petty
tyrants
and
the
country
suffered
equally
from
its
enemies
and
its
protectors
these
wounds
rankled
the
deeper
when
the
unhappy
victims
recollected
that
germany
was
sacrificed
to
the
ambition
of
foreign
powers
who
for
their
own
ends
prolonged
the
miseries
of
war
germany
bled
under
the
scourge
to
extend
the
conquests
and
influence
of
sweden
and
the
torch
of
discord
was
kept
alive
within
the
empire
that
the
services
of
richelieu
might
be
rendered
indispensable
in
france
but
in
truth
it
was
not
merely
interested
voices
which
opposed
a
peace
and
if
both
sweden
and
the
german
states
were
anxious
from
corrupt
motives
to
prolong
the
conflict
they
were
seconded
in
their
views
by
sound
policy
after
the
defeat
of
nordlingen
an
equitable
peace
was
not
to
be
expected
from
the
emperor
and
this
being
the
case
was
it
not
too
great
a
sacrifice
after
seventeen
years
of
war
with
all
its
miseries
to
abandon
the
contest
not
only
without
advantage
but
even
with
loss
what
would
avail
so
much
bloodshed
if
all
was
to
remain
as
it
had
been
if
their
rights
and
pretensions
were
neither
larger
nor
safer
if
all
that
had
been
won
with
so
much
difficulty
was
to
be
surrendered
for
a
peace
at
any
cost
would
it
not
be
better
to
endure
for
two
or
three
years
more
the
burdens
they
had
borne
so
long
and
to
reap
at
last
some
recompense
for
twenty
years
of
suffering
neither
was
it
doubtful
that
peace
might
at
last
be
obtained
on
favourable
terms
if
only
the
swedes
and
the
german
protestants
should
continue
united
in
the
cabinet
and
in
the
field
and
pursued
their
common
interests
with
a
reciprocal
sympathy
and
zeal
their
divisions
alone
had
rendered
the
enemy
formidable
and
protracted
the
acquisition
of
a
lasting
and
general
peace
and
this
great
evil
the
elector
of
saxony
had
brought
upon
the
protestant
cause
by
concluding
a
separate
treaty
with
austria
he
indeed
had
commenced
his
negociations
with
the
emperor
even
before
the
battle
of
nordlingen
and
the
unfortunate
issue
of
that
battle
only
accelerated
their
conclusion
by
it
all
his
confidence
in
the
swedes
was
lost
and
it
was
even
doubted
whether
they
would
ever
recover
from
the
blow
the
jealousies
among
their
generals
the
insubordination
of
the
army
and
the
exhaustion
of
the
swedish
kingdom
shut
out
any
reasonable
prospect
of
effective
assistance
on
their
part
the
elector
hastened
therefore
to
profit
by
the
emperor
magnanimity
who
even
after
the
battle
of
nordlingen
did
not
recall
the
conditions
previously
offered
while
oxenstiern
who
had
assembled
the
estates
in
frankfort
made
further
demands
upon
them
and
him
the
emperor
on
the
contrary
made
concessions
and
therefore
it
required
no
long
consideration
to
decide
between
them
in
the
mean
time
however
he
was
anxious
to
escape
the
charge
of
sacrificing
the
common
cause
and
attending
only
to
his
own
interests
all
the
german
states
and
even
the
swedes
were
publicly
invited
to
become
parties
to
this
peace
although
saxony
and
the
emperor
were
the
only
powers
who
deliberated
upon
it
and
who
assumed
the
right
to
give
law
to
germany
by
this
tribunal
the
grievances
of
the
protestants
were
discussed
their
rights
and
privileges
decided
and
even
the
fate
of
religions
determined
without
the
presence
of
those
who
were
most
deeply
interested
in
it
between
them
a
general
peace
was
resolved
on
and
it
was
to
be
enforced
by
an
imperial
army
of
execution
as
a
formal
decree
of
the
empire
whoever
opposed
it
was
to
be
treated
as
a
public
enemy
and
thus
contrary
to
their
rights
the
states
were
to
be
compelled
to
acknowledge
a
law
in
the
passing
of
which
they
had
no
share
thus
even
in
form
the
pacification
at
prague
was
an
arbitrary
measure
nor
was
it
less
so
in
its
contents
the
edict
of
restitution
had
been
the
chief
cause
of
dispute
between
the
elector
and
the
emperor
and
therefore
it
was
first
considered
in
their
deliberations
without
formally
annulling
it
it
was
determined
by
the
treaty
of
prague
that
all
the
ecclesiastical
domains
holding
immediately
of
the
empire
and
among
the
mediate
ones
those
which
had
been
seized
by
the
protestants
subsequently
to
the
treaty
at
passau
should
for
forty
years
remain
in
the
same
position
as
they
had
been
in
before
the
edict
of
restitution
but
without
any
formal
decision
of
the
diet
to
that
effect
before
the
expiration
of
this
term
a
commission
composed
of
equal
numbers
of
both
religions
should
proceed
to
settle
the
matter
peaceably
and
according
to
law
and
if
this
commission
should
be
unable
to
come
to
a
decision
each
party
should
remain
in
possession
of
the
rights
which
it
had
exercised
before
the
edict
of
restitution
this
arrangement
therefore
far
from
removing
the
grounds
of
dissension
only
suspended
the
dispute
for
a
time
and
this
article
of
the
treaty
of
prague
only
covered
the
embers
of
a
future
war
the
archbishopric
of
magdeburg
remained
in
possession
of
prince
augustus
of
saxony
and
halberstadt
in
that
of
the
archduke
leopold
william
four
estates
were
taken
from
the
territory
of
magdeburg
and
given
to
saxony
for
which
the
administrator
of
magdeburg
christian
william
of
brandenburg
was
otherwise
to
be
indemnified
the
dukes
of
mecklenburg
upon
acceding
to
this
treaty
were
to
be
acknowledged
as
rightful
possessors
of
their
territories
in
which
the
magnanimity
of
gustavus
adolphus
had
long
ago
reinstated
them
donauwerth
recovered
its
liberties
the
important
claims
of
the
heirs
of
the
palatine
however
important
it
might
be
for
the
protestant
cause
not
to
lose
this
electorate
vote
in
the
diet
were
passed
over
in
consequence
of
the
animosity
subsisting
between
the
lutherans
and
the
calvinists
all
the
conquests
which
in
the
course
of
the
war
had
been
made
by
the
german
states
or
by
the
league
and
the
emperor
were
to
be
mutually
restored
all
which
had
been
appropriated
by
the
foreign
powers
of
france
and
sweden
was
to
be
forcibly
wrested
from
them
by
the
united
powers
the
troops
of
the
contracting
parties
were
to
be
formed
into
one
imperial
army
which
supported
and
paid
by
the
empire
was
by
force
of
arms
to
carry
into
execution
the
covenants
of
the
treaty
as
the
peace
of
prague
was
intended
to
serve
as
a
general
law
of
the
empire
those
points
which
did
not
immediately
affect
the
latter
formed
the
subject
of
a
separate
treaty
by
it
lusatia
was
ceded
to
the
elector
of
saxony
as
a
fief
of
bohemia
and
special
articles
guaranteed
the
freedom
of
religion
of
this
country
and
of
silesia
all
the
protestant
states
were
invited
to
accede
to
the
treaty
of
prague
and
on
that
condition
were
to
benefit
by
the
amnesty
the
princes
of
wurtemberg
and
baden
whose
territories
the
emperor
was
already
in
possession
of
and
which
he
was
not
disposed
to
restore
unconditionally
and
such
vassals
of
austria
as
had
borne
arms
against
their
sovereign
and
those
states
which
under
the
direction
of
oxenstiern
composed
the
council
of
the
upper
german
circle
were
excluded
from
the
treaty
not
so
much
with
the
view
of
continuing
the
war
against
them
as
of
compelling
them
to
purchase
peace
at
a
dearer
rate
their
territories
were
to
be
retained
in
pledge
till
every
thing
should
be
restored
to
its
former
footing
such
was
the
treaty
of
prague
equal
justice
however
towards
all
might
perhaps
have
restored
confidence
between
the
head
of
the
empire
and
its
members
between
the
protestants
and
the
roman
catholics
between
the
reformed
and
the
lutheran
party
and
the
swedes
abandoned
by
all
their
allies
would
in
all
probability
have
been
driven
from
germany
with
disgrace
but
this
inequality
strengthened
in
those
who
were
more
severely
treated
the
spirit
of
mistrust
and
opposition
and
made
it
an
easier
task
for
the
swedes
to
keep
alive
the
flame
of
war
and
to
maintain
a
party
in
germany
the
peace
of
prague
as
might
have
been
expected
was
received
with
very
various
feelings
throughout
germany
the
attempt
to
conciliate
both
parties
had
rendered
it
obnoxious
to
both
the
protestants
complained
of
the
restraints
imposed
upon
them
the
roman
catholics
thought
that
these
hated
sectaries
had
been
favoured
at
the
expense
of
the
true
church
in
the
opinion
of
the
latter
the
church
had
been
deprived
of
its
inalienable
rights
by
the
concession
to
the
protestants
of
forty
years
undisturbed
possession
of
the
ecclesiastical
benefices
while
the
former
murmured
that
the
interests
of
the
protestant
church
had
been
betrayed
because
toleration
had
not
been
granted
to
their
in
the
austrian
dominions
but
no
one
was
so
bitterly
reproached
as
the
elector
of
saxony
who
was
publicly
denounced
as
a
deserter
a
traitor
to
religion
and
the
liberties
of
the
empire
and
a
confederate
of
the
emperor
in
the
mean
time
he
consoled
himself
with
the
triumph
of
seeing
most
of
the
protestant
states
compelled
by
necessity
to
embrace
this
peace
the
elector
of
brandenburg
duke
william
of
weimar
the
princes
of
anhalt
the
dukes
of
mecklenburg
the
dukes
of
brunswick
lunenburg
the
hanse
towns
and
most
of
the
imperial
cities
acceded
to
it
the
landgrave
william
of
hesse
long
wavered
or
affected
to
do
so
in
order
to
gain
time
and
to
regulate
his
measures
by
the
course
of
events
he
had
conquered
several
fertile
provinces
of
westphalia
and
derived
from
them
principally
the
means
of
continuing
the
war
these
by
the
terms
of
the
treaty
he
was
bound
to
restore
bernard
duke
of
weimar
whose
states
as
yet
existed
only
on
paper
as
a
belligerent
power
was
not
affected
by
the
treaty
but
as
a
general
was
so
materially
and
in
either
view
he
must
equally
be
disposed
to
reject
it
his
whole
riches
consisted
in
his
bravery
his
possessions
in
his
sword
war
alone
gave
him
greatness
and
importance
and
war
alone
could
realize
the
projects
which
his
ambition
suggested
but
of
all
who
declaimed
against
the
treaty
of
prague
none
were
so
loud
in
their
clamours
as
the
swedes
and
none
had
so
much
reason
for
their
opposition
invited
to
germany
by
the
germans
themselves
the
champions
of
the
protestant
church
and
the
freedom
of
the
states
which
they
had
defended
with
so
much
bloodshed
and
with
the
sacred
life
of
their
king
they
now
saw
themselves
suddenly
and
shamefully
abandoned
disappointed
in
all
their
hopes
without
reward
and
without
gratitude
driven
from
the
empire
for
which
they
had
toiled
and
bled
and
exposed
to
the
ridicule
of
the
enemy
by
the
very
princes
who
owed
every
thing
to
them
no
satisfaction
no
indemnification
for
the
expenses
which
they
had
incurred
no
equivalent
for
the
conquests
which
they
were
to
leave
behind
them
was
provided
by
the
treaty
of
prague
they
were
to
be
dismissed
poorer
than
they
came
or
if
they
resisted
to
be
expelled
by
the
very
powers
who
had
invited
them
the
elector
of
saxony
at
last
spoke
of
a
pecuniary
indemnification
and
mentioned
the
small
sum
of
two
millions
five
hundred
thousand
florins
but
the
swedes
had
already
expended
considerably
more
and
this
disgraceful
equivalent
in
money
was
both
contrary
to
their
true
interests
and
injurious
to
their
pride
the
electors
of
bavaria
and
saxony
replied
oxenstiern
have
been
paid
for
their
services
which
as
vassals
they
were
bound
to
render
the
emperor
with
the
possession
of
important
provinces
and
shall
we
who
have
sacrificed
our
king
for
germany
be
dismissed
with
the
miserable
sum
of
florins
the
disappointment
of
their
expectations
was
the
more
severe
because
the
swedes
had
calculated
upon
being
recompensed
with
the
duchy
of
pomerania
the
present
possessor
of
which
was
old
and
without
heirs
but
the
succession
of
this
territory
was
confirmed
by
the
treaty
of
prague
to
the
elector
of
brandenburg
and
all
the
neighbouring
powers
declared
against
allowing
the
swedes
to
obtain
a
footing
within
the
empire
never
in
the
whole
course
of
the
war
had
the
prospects
of
the
swedes
looked
more
gloomy
than
in
the
year
immediately
after
the
conclusion
of
the
treaty
of
prague
many
of
their
allies
particularly
among
the
free
cities
abandoned
them
to
benefit
by
the
peace
others
were
compelled
to
accede
to
it
by
the
victorious
arms
of
the
emperor
augsburg
subdued
by
famine
surrendered
under
the
severest
conditions
wurtzburg
and
coburg
were
lost
to
the
austrians
the
league
of
heilbronn
was
formally
dissolved
nearly
the
whole
of
upper
germany
the
chief
seat
of
the
swedish
power
was
reduced
under
the
emperor
saxony
on
the
strength
of
the
treaty
of
prague
demanded
the
evacuation
of
thuringia
halberstadt
and
magdeburg
philipsburg
the
military
depot
of
france
was
surprised
by
the
austrians
with
all
the
stores
it
contained
and
this
severe
loss
checked
the
activity
of
france
to
complete
the
embarrassments
of
sweden
the
truce
with
poland
was
drawing
to
a
close
to
support
a
war
at
the
same
time
with
poland
and
in
germany
was
far
beyond
the
power
of
sweden
and
all
that
remained
was
to
choose
between
them
pride
and
ambition
declared
in
favour
of
continuing
the
german
war
at
whatever
sacrifice
on
the
side
of
poland
an
army
however
was
necessary
to
command
the
respect
of
poland
and
to
give
weight
to
sweden
in
any
negotiations
for
a
truce
or
a
peace
the
mind
of
oxenstiern
firm
and
inexhaustible
in
expedients
set
itself
manfully
to
meet
these
calamities
which
all
combined
to
overwhelm
sweden
and
his
shrewd
understanding
taught
him
how
to
turn
even
misfortunes
to
his
advantage
the
defection
of
so
many
german
cities
of
the
empire
deprived
him
it
is
true
of
a
great
part
of
his
former
allies
but
at
the
same
time
it
freed
him
from
the
necessity
of
paying
any
regard
to
their
interests
the
more
the
number
of
his
enemies
increased
the
more
provinces
and
magazines
were
opened
to
his
troops
the
gross
ingratitude
of
the
states
and
the
haughty
contempt
with
which
the
emperor
behaved
who
did
not
even
condescend
to
treat
directly
with
him
about
a
peace
excited
in
him
the
courage
of
despair
and
a
noble
determination
to
maintain
the
struggle
to
the
last
the
continuance
of
war
however
unfortunate
it
might
prove
could
not
render
the
situation
of
sweden
worse
than
it
now
was
and
if
germany
was
to
be
evacuated
it
was
at
least
better
and
nobler
to
do
so
sword
in
hand
and
to
yield
to
force
rather
than
to
fear
in
the
extremity
in
which
the
swedes
were
now
placed
by
the
desertion
of
their
allies
they
addressed
themselves
to
france
who
met
them
with
the
greatest
encouragement
the
interests
of
the
two
crowns
were
closely
united
and
france
would
have
injured
herself
by
allowing
the
swedish
power
in
germany
to
decline
the
helpless
situation
of
the
swedes
was
rather
an
additional
motive
with
france
to
cement
more
closely
their
alliance
and
to
take
a
more
active
part
in
the
german
war
since
the
alliance
with
sweden
at
beerwald
in
france
had
maintained
the
war
against
the
emperor
by
the
arms
of
gustavus
adolphus
without
any
open
or
formal
breach
by
furnishing
subsidies
and
increasing
the
number
of
his
enemies
but
alarmed
at
the
unexpected
rapidity
and
success
of
the
swedish
arms
france
in
anxiety
to
restore
the
balance
of
power
which
was
disturbed
by
the
preponderance
of
the
swedes
seemed
for
a
time
to
have
lost
sight
of
her
original
designs
she
endeavoured
to
protect
the
roman
catholic
princes
of
the
empire
against
the
swedish
conqueror
by
the
treaties
of
neutrality
and
when
this
plan
failed
she
even
meditated
herself
to
declare
war
against
him
but
no
sooner
had
the
death
of
gustavus
adolphus
and
the
desperate
situation
of
the
swedish
affairs
dispelled
this
apprehension
than
she
returned
with
fresh
zeal
to
her
first
design
and
readily
afforded
in
this
misfortune
the
aid
which
in
the
hour
of
success
she
had
refused
freed
from
the
checks
which
the
ambition
and
vigilance
of
gustavus
adolphus
placed
upon
her
plans
of
aggrandizement
france
availed
herself
of
the
favourable
opportunity
afforded
by
the
defeat
of
nordlingen
to
obtain
the
entire
direction
of
the
war
and
to
prescribe
laws
to
those
who
sued
for
her
powerful
protection
the
moment
seemed
to
smile
upon
her
boldest
plans
and
those
which
had
formerly
seemed
chimerical
now
appeared
to
be
justified
by
circumstances
she
now
turned
her
whole
attention
to
the
war
in
germany
and
as
soon
as
she
had
secured
her
own
private
ends
by
a
treaty
with
the
germans
she
suddenly
entered
the
political
arena
as
an
active
and
a
commanding
power
while
the
other
belligerent
states
had
been
exhausting
themselves
in
a
tedious
contest
france
had
been
reserving
her
strength
and
maintained
the
contest
by
money
alone
but
now
when
the
state
of
things
called
for
more
active
measures
she
seized
the
sword
and
astonished
europe
by
the
boldness
and
magnitude
of
her
undertakings
at
the
same
moment
she
fitted
out
two
fleets
and
sent
six
different
armies
into
the
field
while
she
subsidized
a
foreign
crown
and
several
of
the
german
princes
animated
by
this
powerful
the
swedes
and
germans
awoke
from
the
consternation
and
hoped
sword
in
hand
to
obtain
a
more
honourable
peace
than
that
of
prague
abandoned
by
their
confederates
who
had
been
reconciled
to
the
emperor
they
formed
a
still
closer
alliance
with
france
which
increased
her
support
with
their
growing
necessities
at
the
same
time
taking
a
more
active
although
secret
share
in
the
german
war
until
at
last
she
threw
off
the
mask
altogether
and
in
her
own
name
made
an
unequivocal
declaration
of
war
against
the
emperor
to
leave
sweden
at
full
liberty
to
act
against
austria
france
commenced
her
operations
by
liberating
it
from
all
fear
of
a
polish
war
by
means
of
the
count
its
minister
an
agreement
was
concluded
between
the
two
powers
at
stummsdorf
in
prussia
by
which
the
truce
was
prolonged
for
years
though
not
without
a
great
sacrifice
on
the
part
of
the
swedes
who
ceded
by
a
single
stroke
of
the
pen
almost
the
whole
of
polish
prussia
the
conquest
of
gustavus
adolphus
the
treaty
of
beerwald
was
with
certain
modifications
which
circumstances
rendered
necessary
renewed
at
different
times
at
compiegne
and
afterwards
at
wismar
and
hamburg
france
had
already
come
to
a
rupture
with
spain
in
may
and
the
vigorous
attack
which
it
made
upon
that
power
deprived
the
emperor
of
his
most
valuable
auxiliaries
from
the
netherlands
by
supporting
the
landgrave
william
of
cassel
and
duke
bernard
of
weimar
the
swedes
were
enabled
to
act
with
more
vigour
upon
the
elbe
and
the
danube
and
a
diversion
upon
the
rhine
compelled
the
emperor
to
divide
his
force
the
war
was
now
prosecuted
with
increasing
activity
by
the
treaty
of
prague
the
emperor
had
lessened
the
number
of
his
adversaries
within
the
empire
though
at
the
same
time
the
zeal
and
activity
of
his
foreign
enemies
had
been
augmented
by
it
in
germany
his
influence
was
almost
unlimited
for
with
the
exception
of
a
few
states
he
had
rendered
himself
absolute
master
of
the
german
body
and
its
resources
and
was
again
enabled
to
act
in
the
character
of
emperor
and
sovereign
the
first
fruit
of
his
power
was
the
elevation
of
his
son
ferdinand
to
the
dignity
of
king
of
the
romans
to
which
he
was
elected
by
a
decided
majority
of
votes
notwithstanding
the
opposition
of
treves
and
of
the
heirs
of
the
elector
palatine
but
on
the
other
hand
he
had
exasperated
the
swedes
to
desperation
had
armed
the
power
of
france
against
him
and
drawn
its
troops
into
the
heart
of
the
kingdom
france
and
sweden
with
their
german
allies
formed
from
this
moment
one
firm
and
compactly
united
power
the
emperor
with
the
german
states
which
adhered
to
him
were
equally
firm
and
united
the
swedes
who
no
longer
fought
for
germany
but
for
their
own
lives
showed
no
more
indulgence
relieved
from
the
necessity
of
consulting
their
german
allies
or
accounting
to
them
for
the
plans
which
they
adopted
they
acted
with
more
precipitation
rapidity
and
boldness
battles
though
less
decisive
became
more
obstinate
and
bloody
greater
achievements
both
in
bravery
and
military
skill
were
performed
but
they
were
but
insulated
efforts
and
being
neither
dictated
by
any
consistent
plan
nor
improved
by
any
commanding
spirit
had
comparatively
little
influence
upon
the
course
of
the
war
saxony
had
bound
herself
by
the
treaty
of
prague
to
expel
the
swedes
from
germany
from
this
moment
the
banners
of
the
saxons
and
imperialists
were
united
the
former
confederates
were
converted
into
implacable
enemies
the
archbishopric
of
magdeburg
which
by
the
treaty
was
ceded
to
the
prince
of
saxony
was
still
held
by
the
swedes
and
every
attempt
to
acquire
it
by
negociation
had
proved
ineffectual
hostilities
commenced
by
the
elector
of
saxony
recalling
all
his
subjects
from
the
army
of
banner
which
was
encamped
upon
the
elbe
the
officers
long
irritated
by
the
accumulation
of
their
arrears
obeyed
the
summons
and
evacuated
one
quarter
after
another
as
the
saxons
at
the
same
time
made
a
movement
towards
mecklenburg
to
take
doemitz
and
to
drive
the
swedes
from
pomerania
and
the
baltic
banner
suddenly
marched
thither
relieved
doemitz
and
totally
defeated
the
saxon
general
baudissin
with
men
of
whom
were
slain
and
about
the
same
number
taken
prisoners
reinforced
by
the
troops
and
artillery
which
had
hitherto
been
employed
in
polish
prussia
but
which
the
treaty
of
stummsdorf
rendered
unnecessary
this
brave
and
impetuous
general
made
the
following
year
a
sudden
inroad
into
the
electorate
of
saxony
where
he
gratified
his
inveterate
hatred
of
the
saxons
by
the
most
destructive
ravages
irritated
by
the
memory
of
old
grievances
which
during
their
common
campaigns
he
and
the
swedes
had
suffered
from
the
haughtiness
of
the
saxons
and
now
exasperated
to
the
utmost
by
the
late
defection
of
the
elector
they
wreaked
upon
the
unfortunate
inhabitants
all
their
rancour
against
austria
and
bavaria
the
swedish
soldier
had
fought
from
a
sense
as
it
were
of
duty
but
against
the
saxons
they
contended
with
all
the
energy
of
private
animosity
and
personal
revenge
detesting
them
as
deserters
and
traitors
for
the
hatred
of
former
friends
is
of
all
the
most
fierce
and
irreconcileable
the
powerful
diversion
made
by
the
duke
of
weimar
and
the
landgrave
of
hesse
upon
the
rhine
and
in
westphalia
prevented
the
emperor
from
affording
the
necessary
assistance
to
saxony
and
left
the
whole
electorate
exposed
to
the
destructive
ravages
of
banner
army
at
length
the
elector
having
formed
a
junction
with
the
imperial
general
hatzfeld
advanced
against
magdeburg
which
banner
in
vain
hastened
to
relieve
the
united
army
of
the
imperialists
and
the
saxons
now
spread
itself
over
brandenburg
wrested
several
places
from
the
swedes
and
almost
drove
them
to
the

contrary
to
all
expectation
banner

had
been
given
up
as
lost
attacked
the
allies
on
the
of
september
at
wittstock
where
a
bloody
battle
took
place
the
onset
was
terrific
and
the
whole
force
of
the
enemy
was
directed
against
the
right
wing
of
the
swedes
which
was
led
by
banner
in

the
contest
was
long
maintained
with
equal
animosity
and
obstinacy
on
both
sides
there
was
not
a
squadron
among
the
swedes
which
did
not
return
ten
times
to
the
charge
to
be
as
often
repulsed
when
at
last
banner
was
obliged
to
retire
before
the
superior
numbers
of
the
enemy
his
left
wing
sustained
the
combat
until
night
and
the
second
line
of
the
swedes
which
had
not
as
yet
been
engaged
was
prepared
to
renew
it
the
next
morning
but
the
elector
did
not
wait
for
a
second
attack
his
army
was
exhausted
by
the
efforts
of
the
preceding
day
and
as
the
drivers
had
fled
with
the
horses
his
artillery
was
unserviceable
he
accordingly
retreated
in
the
night
with
count
hatzfeld
and
relinquished
the
ground
to
the
swedes
about
of
the
allies
fell
upon
the
field
exclusive
of
those
who
were
killed
in
the
pursuit
or
who
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
exasperated
peasantry
one
hundred
and
fifty
standards
and
colours
pieces
of
cannon
the
whole
baggage
and
silver
plate
of
the
elector
were
captured
and
more
than
men
taken
prisoners
this
brilliant
victory
achieved
over
an
enemy
far
superior
in
numbers
and
in
a
very
advantageous
position
restored
the
swedes
at
once
to
their
former
reputation
their
enemies
were
discouraged
and
their
friends
inspired
with
new
hopes
banner
instantly
followed
up
this
decisive
success
and
hastily
crossing
the
elbe
drove
the
imperialists
before
him
through
thuringia
and
hesse
into
westphalia
he
then
returned
and
took
up
his
winter
quarters
in
saxony
but
without
the
material
aid
furnished
by
the
diversion
upon
the
rhine
and
the
activity
there
of
duke
bernard
and
the
french
these
important
successes
would
have
been
unattainable
duke
bernard
after
the
defeat
of
nordlingen
reorganized
his
broken
army
at
wetterau
but
abandoned
by
the
confederates
of
the
league
of
heilbronn
which
had
been
dissolved
by
the
peace
of
prague
and
receiving
little
support
from
the
swedes
he
found
himself
unable
to
maintain
an
army
or
to
perform
any
enterprise
of
importance
the
defeat
at
nordlingen
had
terminated
all
his
hopes
on
the
duchy
of
franconia
while
the
weakness
of
the
swedes
destroyed
the
chance
of
retrieving
his
fortunes
through
their
assistance
tired
too
of
the
constraint
imposed
upon
him
by
the
imperious
chancellor
he
turned
his
attention
to
france
who
could
easily
supply
him
with
money
the
only
aid
which
he
required
and
france
readily
acceded
to
his
proposals
richelieu
desired
nothing
so
much
as
to
diminish
the
influence
of
the
swedes
in
the
german
war
and
to
obtain
the
direction
of
it
for
himself
to
secure
this
end
nothing
appeared
more
effectual
than
to
detach
from
the
swedes
their
bravest
general
to
win
him
to
the
interests
of
france
and
to
secure
for
the
execution
of
its
projects
the
services
of
his
arm
from
a
prince
like
bernard
who
could
not
maintain
himself
without
foreign
support
france
had
nothing
to
fear
since
no
success
however
brilliant
could
render
him
independent
of
that
crown
bernard
himself
came
into
france
and
in
october
concluded
a
treaty
at
germaine
en
laye
not
as
a
swedish
general
but
in
his
own
name
by
which
it
was
stipulated
that
he
should
receive
for
himself
a
yearly
pension
of
one
million
five
hundred
thousand
livres
and
four
millions
for
the
support
of
his
army
which
he
was
to
command
under
the
orders
of
the
french
king
to
inflame
his
zeal
and
to
accelerate
the
conquest
of
alsace
france
did
not
hesitate
by
a
secret
article
to
promise
him
that
province
for
his
services
a
promise
which
richelieu
had
little
intention
of
performing
and
which
the
duke
also
estimated
at
its
real
worth
but
bernard
confided
in
his
good
fortune
and
in
his
arms
and
met
artifice
with
dissimulation
if
he
could
once
succeed
in
wresting
alsace
from
the
enemy
he
did
not
despair
of
being
able
in
case
of
need
to
maintain
it
also
against
a
friend
he
now
raised
an
army
at
the
expense
of
france
which
he
commanded
nominally
under
the
orders
of
that
power
but
in
reality
without
any
limitation
whatever
and
without
having
wholly
abandoned
his
engagements
with
sweden
he
began
his
operations
upon
the
rhine
where
another
french
army
under
cardinal
lavalette
had
already
in
commenced
hostilities
against
the
emperor
against
this
force
the
main
body
of
the
imperialists
after
the
great
victory
of
nordlingen
and
the
reduction
of
swabia
and
franconia
had
advanced
under
the
command
of
gallas
had
driven
them
as
far
as
metz
cleared
the
rhine
and
took
from
the
swedes
the
towns
of
metz
and
frankenthal
of
which
they
were
in
possession
but
frustrated
by
the
vigorous
resistance
of
the
french
in
his
main
object
of
taking
up
his
winter
quarters
in
france
he
led
back
his
exhausted
troops
into
alsace
and
swabia
at
the
opening
of
the
next
campaign
he
passed
the
rhine
at
breysach
and
prepared
to
carry
the
war
into
the
interior
of
france
he
actually
entered
burgundy
while
the
spaniards
from
the
netherlands
made
progress
in
picardy
and
john
de
werth
a
formidable
general
of
the
league
and
a
celebrated
partisan
pushed
his
march
into
champagne
and
spread
consternation
even
to
the
gates
of
paris
but
an
insignificant
fortress
in
franche
comte
completely
checked
the
imperialists
and
they
were
obliged
a
second
time
to
abandon
their
enterprise
the
activity
of
duke
bernard
had
hitherto
been
impeded
by
his
dependence
on
a
french
general
more
suited
to
the
priestly
robe
than
to
the
baton
of
command
and
although
in
conjunction
with
him
he
conquered
alsace
saverne
he
found
himself
unable
in
the
years
and
to
maintain
his
position
upon
the
rhine
the
ill
success
of
the
french
arms
in
the
netherlands
had
cheated
the
activity
of
operations
in
alsace
and
breisgau
but
in
the
war
in
that
quarter
took
a
more
brilliant
turn
relieved
from
his
former
restraint
and
with
unlimited
command
of
his
troops
duke
bernard
in
the
beginning
of
february
left
his
winter
quarters
in
the
bishopric
of
basle
and
unexpectedly
appeared
upon
the
rhine
where
at
this
rude
season
of
the
year
an
attack
was
little
anticipated
the
forest
towns
of
laufenburg
waldshut
and
seckingen
were
surprised
and
rhinefeldt
besieged
the
duke
of
savelli
the
imperial
general
who
commanded
in
that
quarter
hastened
by
forced
marches
to
the
relief
of
this
important
place
succeeded
in
raising
the
siege
and
compelled
the
duke
of
weimar
with
great
loss
to
retire
but
contrary
to
all
human
expectation
he
appeared
on
the
third
day
after
february
before
the
imperialists
in
order
of
battle
and
defeated
them
in
a
bloody
engagement
in
which
the
four
imperial
generals
savelli
john
de
werth
enkeford
and
sperreuter
with
men
were
taken
prisoners
two
of
these
de
werth
and
enkeford
were
afterwards
sent
by
richelieu
orders
into
france
in
order
to
flatter
the
vanity
of
the
french
by
the
sight
of
such
distinguished
prisoners
and
by
the
pomp
of
military
trophies
to
withdraw
the
attention
of
the
populace
from
the
public
distress
the
captured
standards
and
colours
were
with
the
same
view
carried
in
solemn
procession
to
the
church
of
notre
dame
thrice
exhibited
before
the
altar
and
committed
to
sacred
custody
the
taking
of
rhinefeldt
roeteln
and
fribourg
was
the
immediate
consequence
of
the
duke
victory
his
army
now
increased
by
considerable
recruits
and
his
projects
expanded
in
proportion
as
fortune
favoured
him
the
fortress
of
breysach
upon
the
rhine
was
looked
upon
as
holding
the
command
of
that
river
and
as
the
key
of
alsace
no
place
in
this
quarter
was
of
more
importance
to
the
emperor
and
upon
none
had
more
care
been
bestowed
to
protect
breysach
was
the
principal
destination
of
the
italian
army
under
the
duke
of
feria
the
strength
of
its
works
and
its
natural
defences
bade
defiance
to
assault
while
the
imperial
generals
who
commanded
in
that
quarter
had
orders
to
retain
it
at
any
cost
but
the
duke
trusting
to
his
good
fortune
resolved
to
attempt
the
siege
its
strength
rendered
it
impregnable
it
could
therefore
only
be
starved
into
a
surrender
and
this
was
facilitated
by
the
carelessness
of
the
commandant
who
expecting
no
attack
had
been
selling
off
his
stores
as
under
these
circumstances
the
town
could
not
long
hold
out
it
must
be
immediately
relieved
or
victualled
accordingly
the
imperial
general
goetz
rapidly
advanced
at
the
head
of
men
accompanied
by
waggons
loaded
with
provisions
which
he
intended
to
throw
into
the
place
but
he
was
attacked
with
such
vigour
by
duke
bernard
at
witteweyer
that
he
lost
his
whole
force
except
men
together
with
the
entire
transport
a
similar
fate
at
ochsenfeld
near
thann
overtook
the
duke
of
lorraine
who
with
or
men
advanced
to
relieve
the
fortress
after
a
third
attempt
of
general
goetz
for
the
relief
of
breysach
had
proved
ineffectual
the
fortress
reduced
to
the
greatest
extremity
by
famine
surrendered
after
a
blockade
of
four
months
on
the
december
to
its
equally
persevering
and
humane
conqueror
the
capture
of
breysach
opened
a
boundless
field
to
the
ambition
of
the
duke
of
weimar
and
the
romance
of
his
hopes
was
fast
approaching
to
reality
far
from
intending
to
surrender
his
conquests
to
france
he
destined
breysach
for
himself
and
revealed
this
intention
by
exacting
allegiance
from
the
vanquished
in
his
own
name
and
not
in
that
of
any
other
power
intoxicated
by
his
past
success
and
excited
by
the
boldest
hopes
he
believed
that
he
should
be
able
to
maintain
his
conquests
even
against
france
herself
at
a
time
when
everything
depended
upon
bravery
when
even
personal
strength
was
of
importance
when
troops
and
generals
were
of
more
value
than
territories
it
was
natural
for
a
hero
like
bernard
to
place
confidence
in
his
own
powers
and
at
the
head
of
an
excellent
army
who
under
his
command
had
proved
invincible
to
believe
himself
capable
of
accomplishing
the
boldest
and
largest
designs
in
order
to
secure
himself
one
friend
among
the
crowd
of
enemies
whom
he
was
about
to
provoke
he
turned
his
eyes
upon
the
landgravine
amelia
of
hesse
the
widow
of
the
lately
deceased
landgrave
william
a
princess
whose
talents
were
equal
to
her
courage
and
who
along
with
her
hand
would
bestow
valuable
conquests
an
extensive
principality
and
a
well
disciplined
army
by
the
union
of
the
conquests
of
hesse
with
his
own
upon
the
rhine
and
the
junction
of
their
forces
a
power
of
some
importance
and
perhaps
a
third
party
might
be
formed
in
germany
which
might
decide
the
fate
of
the
war
but
a
premature
death
put
a
period
to
these
extensive
schemes
courage
father
joseph
breysach
is
ours
whispered
richelieu
in
the
ear
of
the
capuchin
who
had
long
held
himself
in
readiness
to
be
despatched
into
that
quarter
so
delighted
was
he
with
this
joyful
intelligence
already
in
imagination
he
held
alsace
breisgau
and
all
the
frontiers
of
austria
in
that
quarter
without
regard
to
his
promise
to
duke
bernard
but
the
firm
determination
which
the
latter
had
unequivocally
shown
to
keep
breysach
for
himself
greatly
embarrassed
the
cardinal
and
no
efforts
were
spared
to
retain
the
victorious
bernard
in
the
interests
of
france
he
was
invited
to
court
to
witness
the
honours
by
which
his
triumph
was
to
be
commemorated
but
he
perceived
and
shunned
the
seductive
snare
the
cardinal
even
went
so
far
as
to
offer
him
the
hand
of
his
niece
in
marriage
but
the
proud
german
prince
declined
the
offer
and
refused
to
sully
the
blood
of
saxony
by
a
misalliance
he
was
now
considered
as
a
dangerous
enemy
and
treated
as
such
his
subsidies
were
withdrawn
and
the
governor
of
breysach
and
his
principal
officers
were
bribed
at
least
upon
the
event
of
the
duke
death
to
take
possession
of
his
conquests
and
to
secure
his
troops
these
intrigues
were
no
secret
to
the
duke
and
the
precautions
he
took
in
the
conquered
places
clearly
bespoke
the
distrust
of
france
but
this
misunderstanding
with
the
french
court
had
the
most
prejudicial
influence
upon
his
future
operations
the
preparations
he
was
obliged
to
make
in
order
to
secure
his
conquests
against
an
attack
on
the
side
of
france
compelled
him
to
divide
his
military
strength
while
the
stoppage
of
his
subsidies
delayed
his
appearance
in
the
field
it
had
been
his
intention
to
cross
the
rhine
to
support
the
swedes
and
to
act
against
the
emperor
and
bavaria
on
the
banks
of
the
danube
he
had
already
communicated
his
plan
of
operations
to
banner
who
was
about
to
carry
the
war
into
the
austrian
territories
and
had
promised
to
relieve
him
so
when
a
sudden
death
cut
short
his
heroic
career
in
the
year
of
his
age
at
neuburgh
upon
the
rhine
in
july
he
died
of
a
pestilential
disorder
which
in
the
course
of
two
days
had
carried
off
nearly
men
in
his
camp
the
black
spots
which
appeared
upon
his
body
his
own
dying
expressions
and
the
advantages
which
france
was
likely
to
reap
from
his
sudden
decease
gave
rise
to
a
suspicion
that
he
had
been
removed
by
poison
a
suspicion
sufficiently
refuted
by
the
symptoms
of
his
disorder
in
him
the
allies
lost
their
greatest
general
after
gustavus
adolphus
france
a
formidable
competitor
for
alsace
and
the
emperor
his
most
dangerous
enemy
trained
to
the
duties
of
a
soldier
and
a
general
in
the
school
of
gustavus
adolphus
he
successfully
imitated
his
eminent
model
and
wanted
only
a
longer
life
to
equal
if
not
to
surpass
it
with
the
bravery
of
the
soldier
he
united
the
calm
and
cool
penetration
of
the
general
and
the
persevering
fortitude
of
the
man
with
the
daring
resolution
of
youth
with
the
wild
ardour
of
the
warrior
the
sober
dignity
of
the
prince
the
moderation
of
the
sage
and
the
conscientiousness
of
the
man
of
honour
discouraged
by
no
misfortune
he
quickly
rose
again
in
full
vigour
from
the
severest
defeats
no
obstacles
could
check
his
enterprise
no
disappointments
conquer
his
indomitable
perseverance
his
genius
perhaps
soared
after
unattainable
objects
but
the
prudence
of
such
men
is
to
be
measured
by
a
different
standard
from
that
of
ordinary
people
capable
of
accomplishing
more
he
might
venture
to
form
more
daring
plans
bernard
affords
in
modern
history
a
splendid
example
of
those
days
of
chivalry
when
personal
greatness
had
its
full
weight
and
influence
when
individual
bravery
could
conquer
provinces
and
the
heroic
exploits
of
a
german
knight
raised
him
even
to
the
imperial
throne
the
best
part
of
the
duke
possessions
were
his
army
which
together
with
alsace
he
bequeathed
to
his
brother
william
but
to
this
army
both
france
and
sweden
thought
that
they
had
claims
the
latter
because
it
had
been
raised
in
name
of
that
crown
and
had
done
homage
to
it
the
former
because
it
had
been
supported
by
its
subsidies
the
electoral
prince
of
the
palatinate
also
negociated
for
its
services
and
attempted
first
by
his
agents
and
latterly
in
his
own
person
to
win
it
over
to
his
interests
with
the
view
of
employing
it
in
the
reconquest
of
his
territories
even
the
emperor
endeavoured
to
secure
it
a
circumstance
the
less
surprising
when
we
reflect
that
at
this
time
the
justice
of
the
cause
was
comparatively
unimportant
and
the
extent
of
the
recompense
the
main
object
to
which
the
soldier
looked
and
when
bravery
like
every
other
commodity
was
disposed
of
to
the
highest
bidder
but
france
richer
and
more
determined
outbade
all
competitors
it
bought
over
general
erlach
the
commander
of
breysach
and
the
other
officers
who
soon
placed
that
fortress
with
the
whole
army
in
their
hands
the
young
palatine
prince
charles
louis
who
had
already
made
an
unsuccessful
campaign
against
the
emperor
saw
his
hopes
again
deceived
although
intending
to
do
france
so
ill
a
service
as
to
compete
with
her
for
bernard
army
he
had
the
imprudence
to
travel
through
that
kingdom
the
cardinal
who
dreaded
the
justice
of
the
palatine
cause
was
glad
to
seize
any
opportunity
to
frustrate
his
views
he
accordingly
caused
him
to
be
seized
at
moulin
in
violation
of
the
law
of
nations
and
did
not
set
him
at
liberty
until
he
learned
that
the
army
of
the
duke
of
weimar
had
been
secured
france
was
now
in
possession
of
a
numerous
and
well
disciplined
army
in
germany
and
from
this
moment
began
to
make
open
war
upon
the
emperor
but
it
was
no
longer
against
ferdinand
ii
that
its
hostilities
were
to
be
conducted
for
that
prince
had
died
in
february
in
the
year
of
his
age
the
war
which
his
ambition
had
kindled
however
survived
him
during
a
reign
of
eighteen
years
he
had
never
once
laid
aside
the
sword
nor
tasted
the
blessings
of
peace
as
long
as
his
hand
swayed
the
imperial
sceptre
endowed
with
the
qualities
of
a
good
sovereign
adorned
with
many
of
those
virtues
which
ensure
the
happiness
of
a
people
and
by
nature
gentle
and
humane
we
see
him
from
erroneous
ideas
of
the
monarch
duty
become
at
once
the
instrument
and
the
victim
of
the
evil
passions
of
others
his
benevolent
intentions
frustrated
and
the
friend
of
justice
converted
into
the
oppressor
of
mankind
the
enemy
of
peace
and
the
scourge
of
his
people
amiable
in
domestic
life
and
respectable
as
a
sovereign
but
in
his
policy
ill
advised
while
he
gained
the
love
of
his
roman
catholic
subjects
he
incurred
the
execration
of
the
protestants
history
exhibits
many
and
greater
despots
than
ferdinand
yet
he
alone
has
had
the
unfortunate
celebrity
of
kindling
a
thirty
years
war
but
to
produce
its
lamentable
consequences
his
ambition
must
have
been
seconded
by
a
kindred
spirit
of
the
age
a
congenial
state
of
previous
circumstances
and
existing
seeds
of
discord
at
a
less
turbulent
period
the
spark
would
have
found
no
fuel
and
the
peacefulness
of
the
age
would
have
choked
the
voice
of
individual
ambition
but
now
the
flash
fell
upon
a
pile
of
accumulated
combustibles
and
europe
was
in
flames
his
son
ferdinand
who
a
few
months
before
his
father
death
had
been
raised
to
the
dignity
of
king
of
the
romans
inherited
his
throne
his
principles
and
the
war
which
he
had
caused
but
ferdinand
iii
had
been
a
closer
witness
of
the
sufferings
of
the
people
and
the
devastation
of
the
country
and
felt
more
keenly
and
ardently
the
necessity
of
peace
less
influenced
by
the
jesuits
and
the
spaniards
and
more
moderate
towards
the
religious
views
of
others
he
was
more
likely
than
his
father
to
listen
to
the
voice
of
reason
he
did
so
and
ultimately
restored
to
europe
the
blessing
of
peace
but
not
till
after
a
contest
of
eleven
years
waged
with
sword
and
pen
not
till
after
he
had
experienced
the
impossibility
of
resistance
and
necessity
had
laid
upon
him
its
stern
laws
fortune
favoured
him
at
the
commencement
of
his
reign
and
his
arms
were
victorious
against
the
swedes
the
latter
under
the
command
of
the
victorious
banner
had
after
their
success
at
wittstock
taken
up
their
winter
quarters
in
saxony
and
the
campaign
of
opened
with
the
siege
of
leipzig
the
vigorous
resistance
of
the
garrison
and
the
approach
of
the
electoral
and
imperial
armies
saved
the
town
and
banner
to
prevent
his
communication
with
the
elbe
being
cut
off
was
compelled
to
retreat
into
torgau
but
the
superior
number
of
the
imperialists
drove
him
even
from
that
quarter
and
surrounded
by
the
enemy
hemmed
in
by
rivers
and
suffering
from
famine
he
had
no
course
open
to
him
but
to
attempt
a
highly
dangerous
retreat
into
pomerania
of
which
the
boldness
and
successful
issue
border
upon
romance
the
whole
army
crossed
the
oder
at
a
ford
near
furstenberg
and
the
soldiers
wading
up
to
the
neck
in
water
dragged
the
artillery
across
when
the
horses
refused
to
draw
banner
had
expected
to
be
joined
by
general
wrangel
on
the
farther
side
of
the
oder
in
pomerania
and
in
conjunction
with
him
to
be
able
to
make
head
against
the
enemy
but
wrangel
did
not
appear
and
in
his
stead
he
found
an
imperial
army
posted
at
landsberg
with
a
view
to
cut
off
the
retreat
of
the
swedes
banner
now
saw
that
he
had
fallen
into
a
dangerous
snare
from
which
escape
appeared
impossible
in
his
rear
lay
an
exhausted
country
the
imperialists
and
the
oder
on
his
left
the
oder
too
guarded
by
the
imperial
general
bucheim
offered
no
retreat
in
front
landsberg
custrin
the
warta
and
a
hostile
army
and
on
the
right
poland
in
which
notwithstanding
the
truce
little
confidence
could
be
placed
in
these
circumstances
his
position
seemed
hopeless
and
the
imperialists
were
already
triumphing
in
the
certainty
of
his
fall
banner
with
just
indignation
accused
the
french
as
the
authors
of
this
misfortune
they
had
neglected
to
make
according
to
their
promise
a
diversion
upon
the
rhine
and
by
their
inaction
allowed
the
emperor
to
combine
his
whole
force
upon
the
swedes
when
the
day
comes
cried
the
incensed
general
to
the
french
commissioner
who
followed
the
camp
that
the
swedes
and
germans
join
their
arms
against
france
we
shall
cross
the
rhine
with
less
ceremony
but
reproaches
were
now
useless
what
the
emergency
demanded
was
energy
and
resolution
in
the
hope
of
drawing
the
enemy
by
stratagem
from
the
oder
banner
pretended
to
march
towards
poland
and
despatched
the
greater
part
of
his
baggage
in
this
direction
with
his
own
wife
and
those
of
the
other
officers
the
imperialists
immediately
broke
up
their
camp
and
hurried
towards
the
polish
frontier
to
block
up
the
route
bucheim
left
his
station
and
the
oder
was
stripped
of
its
defenders
on
a
sudden
and
under
cloud
of
night
banner
turned
towards
that
river
and
crossed
it
about
a
mile
above
custrin
with
his
troops
baggage
and
artillery
without
bridges
or
vessels
as
he
had
done
before
at
furstenberg
he
reached
pomerania
without
loss
and
prepared
to
share
with
wrangel
the
defence
of
that
province
but
the
imperialists
under
the
command
of
gallas
entered
that
duchy
at
ribses
and
overran
it
by
their
superior
strength
usedom
and
wolgast
were
taken
by
storm
demmin
capitulated
and
the
swedes
were
driven
far
into
lower
pomerania
it
was
too
more
important
for
them
at
this
moment
than
ever
to
maintain
a
footing
in
that
country
for
bogislaus
xiv
had
died
that
year
and
sweden
must
prepare
to
establish
its
title
to
pomerania
to
prevent
the
elector
of
brandenburg
from
making
good
the
title
to
that
duchy
which
the
treaty
of
prague
had
given
him
sweden
exerted
her
utmost
energies
and
supported
its
generals
to
the
extent
of
her
ability
both
with
troops
and
money
in
other
quarters
of
the
kingdom
the
affairs
of
the
swedes
began
to
wear
a
more
favourable
aspect
and
to
recover
from
the
humiliation
into
which
they
had
been
thrown
by
the
inaction
of
france
and
the
desertion
of
their
allies
for
after
their
hasty
retreat
into
pomerania
they
had
lost
one
place
after
another
in
upper
saxony
the
princes
of
mecklenburg
closely
pressed
by
the
troops
of
the
emperor
began
to
lean
to
the
side
of
austria
and
even
george
duke
of
lunenburg
declared
against
them
ehrenbreitstein
was
starved
into
a
surrender
by
the
bavarian
general
de
werth
and
the
austrians
possessed
themselves
of
all
the
works
which
had
been
thrown
up
on
the
rhine
france
had
been
the
sufferer
in
the
contest
with
spain
and
the
event
had
by
no
means
justified
the
pompous
expectations
which
had
accompanied
the
opening
of
the
campaign
every
place
which
the
swedes
had
held
in
the
interior
of
germany
was
lost
and
only
the
principal
towns
in
pomerania
still
remained
in
their
hands
but
a
single
campaign
raised
them
from
this
state
of
humiliation
and
the
vigorous
diversion
which
the
victorious
bernard
had
effected
upon
the
rhine
gave
quite
a
new
turn
to
affairs
the
misunderstandings
between
france
and
sweden
were
now
at
last
adjusted
and
the
old
treaty
between
these
powers
confirmed
at
hamburg
with
fresh
advantages
for
sweden
in
hesse
the
politic
landgravine
amelia
had
with
the
approbation
of
the
estates
assumed
the
government
after
the
death
of
her
husband
and
resolutely
maintained
her
rights
against
the
emperor
and
the
house
of
darmstadt
already
zealously
attached
to
the
swedish
protestant
party
on
religious
grounds
she
only
awaited
a
favourable
opportunity
openly
to
declare
herself
by
artful
delays
and
by
prolonging
the
negociations
with
the
emperor
she
had
succeeded
in
keeping
him
inactive
till
she
had
concluded
a
secret
compact
with
france
and
the
victories
of
duke
bernard
had
given
a
favourable
turn
to
the
affairs
of
the
protestants
she
now
at
once
threw
off
the
mask
and
renewed
her
former
alliance
with
the
swedish
crown
the
electoral
prince
of
the
palatinate
was
also
stimulated
by
the
success
of
bernard
to
try
his
fortune
against
the
common
enemy
raising
troops
in
holland
with
english
money
he
formed
a
magazine
at
meppen
and
joined
the
swedes
in
westphalia
his
magazine
was
however
quickly
lost
his
army
defeated
near
flotha
by
count
hatzfeld
but
his
attempt
served
to
occupy
for
some
time
the
attention
of
the
enemy
and
thereby
facilitated
the
operations
of
the
swedes
in
other
quarters
other
friends
began
to
appear
as
fortune
declared
in
their
favour
and
the
circumstance
that
the
states
of
lower
saxony
embraced
a
neutrality
was
of
itself
no
inconsiderable
advantage
under
these
advantages
and
reinforced
by
fresh
troops
from
sweden
and
livonia
banner
opened
with
the
most
favourable
prospects
the
campaign
of
the
imperialists
who
were
in
possession
of
upper
pomerania
and
mecklenburg
either
abandoned
their
positions
or
deserted
in
crowds
to
the
swedes
to
avoid
the
horrors
of
famine
the
most
formidable
enemy
in
this
exhausted
country
the
whole
country
betwixt
the
elbe
and
the
oder
was
so
desolated
by
the
past
marchings
and
quarterings
of
the
troops
that
in
order
to
support
his
army
on
its
march
into
saxony
and
bohemia
banner
was
obliged
to
take
a
circuitous
route
from
lower
pomerania
into
lower
saxony
and
then
into
the
electorate
of
saxony
through
the
territory
of
halberstadt
the
impatience
of
the
lower
saxon
states
to
get
rid
of
such
troublesome
guests
procured
him
so
plentiful
a
supply
of
provisions
that
he
was
provided
with
bread
in
magdeburg
itself
where
famine
had
even
overcome
the
natural
antipathy
of
men
to
human
flesh
his
approach
spread
consternation
among
the
saxons
but
his
views
were
directed
not
against
this
exhausted
country
but
against
the
hereditary
dominions
of
the
emperor
the
victories
of
bernard
encouraged
him
while
the
prosperity
of
the
austrian
provinces
excited
his
hopes
of
booty
after
defeating
the
imperial
general
salis
at
elsterberg
totally
routing
the
saxon
army
at
chemnitz
and
taking
pirna
he
penetrated
with
irresistible
impetuosity
into
bohemia
crossed
the
elbe
threatened
prague
took
brandeis
and
leutmeritz
defeated
general
hofkirchen
with
ten
regiments
and
spread
terror
and
devastation
through
that
defenceless
kingdom
booty
was
his
sole
object
and
whatever
he
could
not
carry
off
he
destroyed
in
order
to
remove
more
of
the
corn
the
ears
were
cut
from
the
stalks
and
the
latter
burnt
above
a
thousand
castles
hamlets
and
villages
were
laid
in
ashes
sometimes
more
than
a
hundred
were
seen
burning
in
one
night
from
bohemia
he
crossed
into
silesia
and
it
was
his
intention
to
carry
his
ravages
even
into
moravia
and
austria
but
to
prevent
this
count
hatzfeld
was
summoned
from
westphalia
and
piccolomini
from
the
netherlands
to
hasten
with
all
speed
to
this
quarter
the
archduke
leopold
brother
to
the
emperor
assumed
the
command
in
order
to
repair
the
errors
of
his
predecessor
gallas
and
to
raise
the
army
from
the
low
ebb
to
which
it
had
fallen
the
result
justified
the
change
and
the
campaign
of
appeared
to
take
a
most
unfortunate
turn
for
the
swedes
they
were
successively
driven
out
of
all
their
posts
in
bohemia
and
anxious
only
to
secure
their
plunder
they
precipitately
crossed
the
heights
of
meissen
but
being
followed
into
saxony
by
the
pursuing
enemy
and
defeated
at
plauen
they
were
obliged
to
take
refuge
in
thuringia
made
masters
of
the
field
in
a
single
summer
they
were
as
rapidly
dispossessed
but
only
to
acquire
it
a
second
time
and
to
hurry
from
one
extreme
to
another
the
army
of
banner
weakened
and
on
the
brink
of
destruction
in
its
camp
at
erfurt
suddenly
recovered
itself
the
duke
of
lunenburg
abandoned
the
treaty
of
prague
and
joined
banner
with
the
very
troops
which
the
year
before
had
fought
against
him
hesse
cassel
sent
reinforcements
and
the
duke
of
longueville
came
to
his
support
with
the
army
of
the
late
duke
bernard
once
more
numerically
superior
to
the
imperialists
banner
offered
them
battle
near
saalfeld
but
their
leader
piccolomini
prudently
declined
an
engagement
having
chosen
too
strong
a
position
to
be
forced
when
the
bavarians
at
length
separated
from
the
imperialists
and
marched
towards
franconia
banner
attempted
an
attack
upon
this
divided
corps
but
the
attempt
was
frustrated
by
the
skill
of
the
bavarian
general
von
mercy
and
the
near
approach
of
the
main
body
of
the
imperialists
both
armies
now
moved
into
the
exhausted
territory
of
hesse
where
they
formed
intrenched
camps
near
each
other
till
at
last
famine
and
the
severity
of
the
winter
compelled
them
both
to
retire
piccolomini
chose
the
fertile
banks
of
the
weser
for
his
winter
quarters
but
being
outflanked
by
banner
he
was
obliged
to
give
way
to
the
swedes
and
to
impose
on
the
franconian
sees
the
burden
of
maintaining
his
army
at
this
period
a
diet
was
held
in
ratisbon
where
the
complaints
of
the
states
were
to
be
heard
measures
taken
for
securing
the
repose
of
the
empire
and
the
question
of
peace
or
war
finally
settled
the
presence
of
the
emperor
the
majority
of
the
roman
catholic
voices
in
the
electoral
college
the
great
number
of
bishops
and
the
withdrawal
of
several
of
the
protestant
votes
gave
the
emperor
a
complete
command
of
the
deliberations
of
the
assembly
and
rendered
this
diet
any
thing
but
a
fair
representative
of
the
opinions
of
the
german
empire
the
protestants
with
reason
considered
it
as
a
mere
combination
of
austria
and
its
creatures
against
their
party
and
it
seemed
to
them
a
laudable
effort
to
interrupt
its
deliberations
and
to
dissolve
the
diet
itself
banner
undertook
this
bold
enterprise
his
military
reputation
had
suffered
by
his
last
retreat
from
bohemia
and
it
stood
in
need
of
some
great
exploit
to
restore
its
former
lustre
without
communicating
his
designs
to
any
one
in
the
depth
of
the
winter
of
as
soon
as
the
roads
and
rivers
were
frozen
he
broke
up
from
his
quarters
in
lunenburg
accompanied
by
marshal
guebriant
who
commanded
the
armies
of
france
and
weimar
he
took
the
route
towards
the
danube
through
thuringia
and
vogtland
and
appeared
before
ratisbon
ere
the
diet
could
be
apprised
of
his
approach
the
consternation
of
the
assembly
was
indescribable
and
in
the
first
alarm
the
deputies
prepared
for
flight
the
emperor
alone
declared
that
he
would
not
leave
the
town
and
encouraged
the
rest
by
his
example
unfortunately
for
the
swedes
a
thaw
came
on
which
broke
up
the
ice
upon
the
danube
so
that
it
was
no
longer
passable
on
foot
while
no
boats
could
cross
it
on
account
of
the
quantities
of
ice
which
were
swept
down
by
the
current
in
order
to
perform
something
and
to
humble
the
pride
of
the
emperor
banner
discourteously
fired
cannon
shots
into
the
town
which
however
did
little
mischief
baffled
in
his
designs
he
resolved
to
penetrate
farther
into
bavaria
and
the
defenceless
province
of
moravia
where
a
rich
booty
and
comfortable
quarters
awaited
his
troops
guebriant
however
began
to
fear
that
the
purpose
of
the
swedes
was
to
draw
the
army
of
bernard
away
from
the
rhine
and
to
cut
off
its
communication
with
france
till
it
should
be
either
entirely
won
over
or
incapacitated
from
acting
independently
he
therefore
separated
from
banner
to
return
to
the
maine
and
the
latter
was
exposed
to
the
whole
force
of
the
imperialists
which
had
been
secretly
drawn
together
between
ratisbon
and
ingoldstadt
and
was
on
its
march
against
him
it
was
now
time
to
think
of
a
rapid
retreat
which
having
to
be
effected
in
the
face
of
an
army
superior
in
cavalry
and
betwixt
woods
and
rivers
through
a
country
entirely
hostile
appeared
almost
impracticable
he
hastily
retired
towards
the
forest
intending
to
penetrate
through
bohemia
into
saxony
but
he
was
obliged
to
sacrifice
three
regiments
at
neuburg
these
with
a
truly
spartan
courage
defended
themselves
for
four
days
behind
an
old
wall
and
gained
time
for
banner
to
escape
he
retreated
by
egra
to
annaberg
piccolomini
took
a
shorter
route
in
pursuit
by
schlakenwald
and
banner
succeeded
only
by
a
single
half
hour
in
clearing
the
pass
of
prisnitz
and
saving
his
whole
army
from
the
imperialists
at
zwickau
he
was
again
joined
by
guebriant
and
both
generals
directed
their
march
towards
halberstadt
after
in
vain
attempting
to
defend
the
saal
and
to
prevent
the
passage
of
the
imperialists
banner
at
length
terminated
his
career
at
halberstadt
in
may
a
victim
to
vexation
and
disappointment
he
sustained
with
great
renown
though
with
varying
success
the
reputation
of
the
swedish
arms
in
germany
and
by
a
train
of
victories
showed
himself
worthy
of
his
great
master
in
the
art
of
war
he
was
fertile
in
expedients
which
he
planned
with
secrecy
and
executed
with
boldness
cautious
in
the
midst
of
dangers
greater
in
adversity
than
in
prosperity
and
never
more
formidable
than
when
upon
the
brink
of
destruction
but
the
virtues
of
the
hero
were
united
with
all
the
railings
and
vices
which
a
military
life
creates
or
at
least
fosters
as
imperious
in
private
life
as
he
was
at
the
head
of
his
army
rude
as
his
profession
and
proud
as
a
conqueror
he
oppressed
the
german
princes
no
less
by
his
haughtiness
than
their
country
by
his
contributions
he
consoled
himself
for
the
toils
of
war
in
voluptuousness
and
the
pleasures
of
the
table
in
which
he
indulged
to
excess
and
was
thus
brought
to
an
early
grave
but
though
as
much
addicted
to
pleasure
as
alexander
or
mahomet
the
second
he
hurried
from
the
arms
of
luxury
into
the
hardest
fatigues
and
placed
himself
in
all
his
vigour
at
the
head
of
his
army
at
the
very
moment
his
soldiers
were
murmuring
at
his
luxurious
excesses
nearly
men
fell
in
the
numerous
battles
which
he
fought
and
about
hostile
standards
and
colours
which
he
sent
to
stockholm
were
the
trophies
of
his
victories
the
want
of
this
great
general
was
soon
severely
felt
by
the
swedes
who
feared
with
justice
that
the
loss
would
not
readily
be
replaced
the
spirit
of
rebellion
and
insubordination
which
had
been
overawed
by
the
imperious
demeanour
of
this
dreaded
commander
awoke
upon
his
death
the
officers
with
an
alarming
unanimity
demanded
payment
of
their
arrears
and
none
of
the
four
generals
who
shared
the
command
possessed
influence
enough
to
satisfy
these
demands
or
to
silence
the
malcontents
all
discipline
was
at
an
end
increasing
want
and
the
imperial
citations
were
daily
diminishing
the
number
of
the
army
the
troops
of
france
and
weimar
showed
little
zeal
those
of
lunenburg
forsook
the
swedish
colours
the
princes
also
of
the
house
of
brunswick
after
the
death
of
duke
george
had
formed
a
separate
treaty
with
the
emperor
and
at
last
even
those
of
hesse
quitted
them
to
seek
better
quarters
in
westphalia
the
enemy
profited
by
these
calamitous
divisions
and
although
defeated
with
loss
in
two
pitched
battles
succeeded
in
making
considerable
progress
in
lower
saxony
at
length
appeared
the
new
swedish
generalissimo
with
fresh
troops
and
money
this
was
bernard
torstensohn
a
pupil
of
gustavus
adolphus
and
his
most
successful
imitator
who
had
been
his
page
during
the
polish
war
though
a
martyr
to
the
gout
and
confined
to
a
litter
he
surpassed
all
his
opponents
in
activity
and
his
enterprises
had
wings
while
his
body
was
held
by
the
most
frightful
of
fetters
under
him
the
scene
of
war
was
changed
and
new
maxims
adopted
which
necessity
dictated
and
the
issue
justified
all
the
countries
in
which
the
contest
had
hitherto
raged
were
exhausted
while
the
house
of
austria
safe
in
its
more
distant
territories
felt
not
the
miseries
of
the
war
under
which
the
rest
of
germany
groaned
torstensohn
first
furnished
them
with
this
bitter
experience
glutted
his
swedes
on
the
fertile
produce
of
austria
and
carried
the
torch
of
war
to
the
very
footsteps
of
the
imperial
throne
in
silesia
the
enemy
had
gained
considerable
advantages
over
the
swedish
general
stalhantsch
and
driven
him
as
far
as
neumark
torstensohn
who
had
joined
the
main
body
of
the
swedes
in
lunenburg
summoned
him
to
unite
with
his
force
and
in
the
year
hastily
marched
into
silesia
through
brandenburg
which
under
its
great
elector
had
begun
to
maintain
an
armed
neutrality
glogau
was
carried
sword
in
hand
without
a
breach
or
formal
approaches
the
duke
francis
albert
of
lauenburg
defeated
and
killed
at
schweidnitz
and
schweidnitz
itself
with
almost
all
the
towns
on
that
side
of
the
oder
taken
he
now
penetrated
with
irresistible
violence
into
the
interior
of
moravia
where
no
enemy
of
austria
had
hitherto
appeared
took
olmutz
and
threw
vienna
itself
into
consternation
but
in
the
mean
time
piccolomini
and
the
archduke
leopold
had
collected
a
superior
force
which
speedily
drove
the
swedish
conquerors
from
moravia
and
after
a
fruitless
attempt
upon
brieg
from
silesia
reinforced
by
wrangel
the
swedes
again
attempted
to
make
head
against
the
enemy
and
relieved
grossglogau
but
could
neither
bring
the
imperialists
to
an
engagement
nor
carry
into
effect
their
own
views
upon
bohemia
overrunning
lusatia
they
took
zittau
in
presence
of
the
enemy
and
after
a
short
stay
in
that
country
directed
their
march
towards
the
elbe
which
they
passed
at
torgau
torstensohn
now
threatened
leipzig
with
a
siege
and
hoped
to
raise
a
large
supply
of
provisions
and
contributions
from
that
prosperous
town
which
for
ten
years
had
been
unvisited
with
the
scourge
of
war
the
imperialists
under
leopold
and
piccolomini
immediately
hastened
by
dresden
to
its
relief
and
torstensohn
to
avoid
being
inclosed
between
this
army
and
the
town
boldly
advanced
to
meet
them
in
order
of
battle
by
a
strange
coincidence
the
two
armies
met
upon
the
very
spot
which
eleven
years
before
gustavus
adolphus
had
rendered
remarkable
by
a
decisive
victory
and
the
heroism
of
their
predecessors
now
kindled
in
the
swedes
a
noble
emulation
on
this
consecrated
ground
the
swedish
generals
stahlhantsch
and
wellenberg
led
their
divisions
with
such
impetuosity
upon
the
left
wing
of
the
imperialists
before
it
was
completely
formed
that
the
whole
cavalry
that
covered
it
were
dispersed
and
rendered
unserviceable
but
the
left
of
the
swedes
was
threatened
with
a
similar
fate
when
the
victorious
right
advanced
to
its
assistance
took
the
enemy
in
flank
and
rear
and
divided
the
austrian
line
the
infantry
on
both
sides
stood
firm
as
a
wall
and
when
their
ammunition
was
exhausted
maintained
the
combat
with
the
of
their
muskets
till
at
last
the
imperialists
completely
surrounded
after
a
contest
of
three
hours
were
compelled
to
abandon
the
field
the
generals
on
both
sides
had
more
than
once
to
rally
their
flying
troops
and
the
archduke
leopold
with
his
regiment
was
the
first
in
the
attack
and
last
in
flight
but
this
bloody
victory
cost
the
swedes
more
than
men
and
two
of
their
best
generals
schlangen
and
lilienhoeck
more
than
of
the
imperialists
were
left
upon
the
field
and
nearly
as
many
taken
prisoners
their
whole
artillery
consisting
of
the
silver
plate
and
portfolio
of
the
archduke
with
the
whole
baggage
of
the
army
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
victors
torstensohn
too
greatly
disabled
by
his
victory
to
pursue
the
enemy
moved
upon
leipzig
the
defeated
army
retired
into
bohemia
where
its
shattered
regiments
reassembled
the
archduke
leopold
could
not
recover
from
the
vexation
caused
by
this
defeat
and
the
regiment
of
cavalry
which
by
its
premature
flight
had
occasioned
the
disaster
experienced
the
effects
of
his
indignation
at
raconitz
in
bohemia
in
presence
of
the
whole
army
he
publicly
declared
it
infamous
deprived
it
of
its
horses
arms
and
ensigns
ordered
its
standards
to
be
torn
condemned
to
death
several
of
the
officers
and
decimated
the
privates
the
surrender
of
leipzig
three
weeks
after
the
battle
was
its
brilliant
result
the
city
was
obliged
to
clothe
the
swedish
troops
anew
and
to
purchase
an
exemption
from
plunder
by
a
contribution
of
to
which
all
the
foreign
merchants
who
had
warehouses
in
the
city
were
to
furnish
their
quota
in
the
middle
of
winter
torstensohn
advanced
against
freyberg
and
for
several
weeks
defied
the
inclemency
of
the
season
hoping
by
his
perseverance
to
weary
out
the
obstinacy
of
the
besieged
but
he
found
that
he
was
merely
sacrificing
the
lives
of
his
soldiers
and
at
last
the
approach
of
the
imperial
general
piccolomini
compelled
him
with
his
weakened
army
to
retire
he
considered
it
however
as
equivalent
to
a
victory
to
have
disturbed
the
repose
of
the
enemy
in
their
winter
quarters
who
by
the
severity
of
the
weather
sustained
a
loss
of
horses
he
now
made
a
movement
towards
the
oder
as
if
with
the
view
of
reinforcing
himself
with
the
garrisons
of
pomerania
and
silesia
but
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
he
again
appeared
upon
the
bohemian
frontier
penetrated
through
that
kingdom
and
relieved
olmutz
in
moravia
which
was
hard
pressed
by
the
imperialists
his
camp
at
dobitschau
two
miles
from
olmutz
commanded
the
whole
of
moravia
on
which
he
levied
heavy
contributions
and
carried
his
ravages
almost
to
the
gates
of
vienna
in
vain
did
the
emperor
attempt
to
arm
the
hungarian
nobility
in
defence
of
this
province
they
appealed
to
their
privileges
and
refused
to
serve
beyond
the
limits
of
their
own
country
thus
the
time
that
should
have
been
spent
in
active
resistance
was
lost
in
fruitless
negociation
and
the
entire
province
was
abandoned
to
the
ravages
of
the
swedes
while
torstensohn
by
his
marches
and
his
victories
astonished
friend
and
foe
the
armies
of
the
allies
had
not
been
inactive
in
other
parts
of
the
empire
the
troops
of
hesse
under
count
eberstein
and
those
of
weimar
under
mareschal
de
guebriant
had
fallen
into
the
electorate
of
cologne
in
order
to
take
up
their
winter
quarters
there
to
get
rid
of
these
troublesome
guests
the
elector
called
to
his
assistance
the
imperial
general
hatzfeldt
and
assembled
his
own
troops
under
general
lamboy
the
latter
was
attacked
by
the
allies
in
january
and
in
a
decisive
action
near
kempen
defeated
with
the
loss
of
about
men
killed
and
about
twice
as
many
prisoners
this
important
victory
opened
to
them
the
whole
electorate
and
neighbouring
territories
so
that
the
allies
were
not
only
enabled
to
maintain
their
winter
quarters
there
but
drew
from
the
country
large
supplies
of
men
and
horses
guebriant
left
the
hessians
to
defend
their
conquests
on
the
lower
rhine
against
hatzfeldt
and
advanced
towards
thuringia
as
if
to
second
the
operations
of
torstensohn
in
saxony
but
instead
of
joining
the
swedes
he
soon
hurried
back
to
the
rhine
and
the
maine
from
which
he
seemed
to
think
he
had
removed
farther
than
was
expedient
but
being
anticipated
in
the
margraviate
of
baden
by
the
bavarians
under
mercy
and
john
de
werth
he
was
obliged
to
wander
about
for
several
weeks
exposed
without
shelter
to
the
inclemency
of
the
winter
and
generally
encamping
upon
the
snow
till
he
found
a
miserable
refuge
in
breisgau
he
at
last
took
the
field
and
in
the
next
summer
by
keeping
the
bavarian
army
employed
in
suabia
prevented
it
from
relieving
thionville
which
was
besieged
by
conde
but
the
superiority
of
the
enemy
soon
drove
him
back
to
alsace
where
he
awaited
a
reinforcement
the
death
of
cardinal
richelieu
took
place
in
november
and
the
subsequent
change
in
the
throne
and
in
the
ministry
occasioned
by
the
death
of
louis
had
for
some
time
withdrawn
the
attention
of
france
from
the
german
war
and
was
the
cause
of
the
inaction
of
its
troops
in
the
field
but
mazarin
the
inheritor
not
only
of
richelieu
power
but
also
of
his
principles
and
his
projects
followed
out
with
renewed
zeal
the
plans
of
his
predecessor
though
the
french
subject
was
destined
to
pay
dearly
enough
for
the
political
greatness
of
his
country
the
main
strength
of
its
armies
which
richelieu
had
employed
against
the
spaniards
was
by
mazarin
directed
against
the
emperor
and
the
anxiety
with
which
he
carried
on
the
war
in
germany
proved
the
sincerity
of
his
opinion
that
the
german
army
was
the
right
arm
of
his
king
and
a
wall
of
safety
around
france
immediately
upon
the
surrender
of
thionville
he
sent
a
considerable
reinforcement
to
guebriant
in
alsace
and
to
encourage
the
troops
to
bear
the
fatigues
of
the
german
war
the
celebrated
victor
of
rocroi
the
duke
of
enghien
afterwards
prince
of
conde
was
placed
at
their
head
guebriant
now
felt
himself
strong
enough
to
appear
again
in
germany
with
repute
he
hastened
across
the
rhine
with
the
view
of
procuring
better
winter
quarters
in
suabia
and
actually
made
himself
master
of
rothweil
where
a
bavarian
magazine
fell
into
his
hands
but
the
place
was
too
dearly
purchased
for
its
worth
and
was
again
lost
even
more
speedily
than
it
had
been
taken
guebriant
received
a
wound
in
the
arm
which
the
surgeon
unskilfulness
rendered
mortal
and
the
extent
of
his
loss
was
felt
on
the
very
day
of
his
death
the
french
army
sensibly
weakened
by
an
expedition
undertaken
at
so
severe
a
season
of
the
year
had
after
the
taking
of
rothweil
withdrawn
into
the
neighbourhood
of
duttlingen
where
it
lay
in
complete
security
without
expectation
of
a
hostile
attack
in
the
mean
time
the
enemy
collected
a
considerable
force
with
a
view
to
prevent
the
french
from
establishing
themselves
beyond
the
rhine
and
so
near
to
bavaria
and
to
protect
that
quarter
from
their
ravages
the
imperialists
under
hatzfeldt
had
formed
a
junction
with
the
bavarians
under
mercy
and
the
duke
of
lorraine
who
during
the
whole
course
of
the
war
was
generally
found
everywhere
except
in
his
own
duchy
joined
their
united
forces
it
was
resolved
to
force
the
quarters
of
the
french
in
duttlingen
and
the
neighbouring
villages
by
surprise
a
favourite
mode
of
proceeding
in
this
war
and
which
being
commonly
accompanied
by
confusion
occasioned
more
bloodshed
than
a
regular
battle
on
the
present
occasion
there
was
the
more
to
justify
it
as
the
french
soldiers
unaccustomed
to
such
enterprises
conceived
themselves
protected
by
the
severity
of
the
winter
against
any
surprise
john
de
werth
a
master
in
this
species
of
warfare
which
he
had
often
put
in
practice
against
gustavus
horn
conducted
the
enterprise
and
succeeded
contrary
to
all
expectation
the
attack
was
made
on
a
side
where
it
was
least
looked
for
on
account
of
the
woods
and
narrow
passes
and
a
heavy
snow
storm
which
fell
upon
the
same
day
the
november
concealed
the
approach
of
the
vanguard
till
it
halted
before
duttlingen
the
whole
of
the
artillery
without
the
place
as
well
as
the
neighbouring
castle
of
honberg
were
taken
without
resistance
duttlingen
itself
was
gradually
surrounded
by
the
enemy
and
all
connexion
with
the
other
quarters
in
the
adjacent
villages
silently
and
suddenly
cut
off
the
french
were
vanquished
without
firing
a
cannon
the
cavalry
owed
their
escape
to
the
swiftness
of
their
horses
and
the
few
minutes
in
advance
which
they
had
gained
upon
their
pursuers
the
infantry
were
cut
to
pieces
or
voluntarily
laid
down
their
arms
about
men
were
killed
and
with
and
captains
taken
prisoners
this
was
perhaps
the
only
battle
in
the
whole
course
of
the
war
which
produced
nearly
the
same
effect
upon
the
party
which
gained
and
that
which
lost
both
these
parties
were
germans
the
french
disgraced
themselves
the
memory
of
this
unfortunate
day
which
was
renewed
years
after
at
rosbach
was
indeed
erased
by
the
subsequent
heroism
of
a
turenne
and
conde
but
the
germans
may
be
pardoned
if
they
indemnified
themselves
for
the
miseries
which
the
policy
of
france
had
heaped
upon
them
by
these
severe
reflections
upon
her
intrepidity
meantime
this
defeat
of
the
french
was
calculated
to
prove
highly
disastrous
to
sweden
as
the
whole
power
of
the
emperor
might
now
act
against
them
while
the
number
of
their
enemies
was
increased
by
a
formidable
accession
torstensohn
had
in
september
suddenly
left
moravia
and
moved
into
silesia
the
cause
of
this
step
was
a
secret
and
the
frequent
changes
which
took
place
in
the
direction
of
his
march
contributed
to
increase
this
perplexity
from
silesia
after
numberless
circuits
he
advanced
towards
the
elbe
while
the
imperialists
followed
him
into
lusatia
throwing
a
bridge
across
the
elbe
at
torgau
he
gave
out
that
he
intended
to
penetrate
through
meissen
into
the
upper
palatinate
in
bavaria
at
barby
he
also
made
a
movement
as
if
to
pass
that
river
but
continued
to
move
down
the
elbe
as
far
as
havelburg
where
he
astonished
his
troops
by
informing
them
that
he
was
leading
them
against
the
danes
in
holstein
the
partiality
which
christian
iv
had
displayed
against
the
swedes
in
his
office
of
mediator
the
jealousy
which
led
him
to
do
all
in
his
power
to
hinder
the
progress
of
their
arms
the
restraints
which
he
laid
upon
their
navigation
of
the
sound
and
the
burdens
which
he
imposed
upon
their
commerce
had
long
roused
the
indignation
of
sweden
and
at
last
when
these
grievances
increased
daily
had
determined
the
regency
to
measures
of
retaliation
dangerous
as
it
seemed
to
involve
the
nation
in
a
new
war
when
even
amidst
its
conquests
it
was
almost
exhausted
by
the
old
the
desire
of
revenge
and
the
hatred
which
subsisted
between
danes
and
swedes
prevailed
over
all
other
considerations
and
even
the
embarrassment
in
which
hostilities
with
germany
had
plunged
it
only
served
as
an
additional
motive
to
try
its
fortune
against
denmark
matters
were
in
fact
arrived
at
last
to
that
extremity
that
the
war
was
prosecuted
merely
for
the
purpose
of
furnishing
food
and
employment
to
the
troops
that
good
winter
quarters
formed
the
chief
subject
of
contention
and
that
success
in
this
point
was
more
valued
than
a
decisive
victory
but
now
the
provinces
of
germany
were
almost
all
exhausted
and
laid
waste
they
were
wholly
destitute
of
provisions
horses
and
men
which
in
holstein
were
to
be
found
in
profusion
if
by
this
movement
torstensohn
should
succeed
merely
in
recruiting
his
army
providing
subsistence
for
his
horses
and
soldiers
and
remounting
his
cavalry
all
the
danger
and
difficulty
would
be
well
repaid
besides
it
was
highly
important
on
the
eve
of
negotiations
for
peace
to
diminish
the
injurious
influence
which
denmark
might
exercise
upon
these
deliberations
to
delay
the
treaty
itself
which
threatened
to
be
prejudicial
to
the
swedish
interests
by
sowing
confusion
among
the
parties
interested
and
with
a
view
to
the
amount
of
indemnification
to
increase
the
number
of
her
conquests
in
order
to
be
the
more
sure
of
securing
those
which
alone
she
was
anxious
to
retain
moreover
the
present
state
of
denmark
justified
even
greater
hopes
if
only
the
attempt
were
executed
with
rapidity
and
silence
the
secret
was
in
fact
so
well
kept
in
stockholm
that
the
danish
minister
had
not
the
slightest
suspicion
of
it
and
neither
france
nor
holland
were
let
into
the
scheme
actual
hostilities
commenced
with
the
declaration
of
war
and
torstensohn
was
in
holstein
before
even
an
attack
was
expected
the
swedish
troops
meeting
with
no
resistance
quickly
overran
this
duchy
and
made
themselves
masters
of
all
its
strong
places
except
rensburg
and
gluckstadt
another
army
penetrated
into
schonen
which
made
as
little
opposition
and
nothing
but
the
severity
of
the
season
prevented
the
enemy
from
passing
the
lesser
baltic
and
carrying
the
war
into
funen
and
zealand
the
danish
fleet
was
unsuccessful
at
femern
and
christian
himself
who
was
on
board
lost
his
right
eye
by
a
splinter
cut
off
from
all
communication
with
the
distant
force
of
the
emperor
his
ally
this
king
was
on
the
point
of
seeing
his
whole
kingdom
overrun
by
the
swedes
and
all
things
threatened
the
speedy
fulfilment
of
the
old
prophecy
of
the
famous
tycho
brahe
that
in
the
year
christian
iv
should
wander
in
the
greatest
misery
from
his
dominions
but
the
emperor
could
not
look
on
with
indifference
while
denmark
was
sacrificed
to
sweden
and
the
latter
strengthened
by
so
great
an
acquisition
notwithstanding
great
difficulties
lay
in
the
way
of
so
long
a
march
through
desolated
provinces
he
did
not
hesitate
to
despatch
an
army
into
holstein
under
count
gallas
who
after
piccolomini
retirement
had
resumed
the
supreme
command
of
the
troops
gallas
accordingly
appeared
in
the
duchy
took
keil
and
hoped
by
forming
a
junction
with
the
danes
to
be
able
to
shut
up
the
swedish
army
in
jutland
meantime
the
hessians
and
the
swedish
general
koenigsmark
were
kept
in
check
by
hatzfeldt
and
the
archbishop
of
bremen
the
son
of
christian
iv
and
afterwards
the
swedes
drawn
into
saxony
by
an
attack
upon
meissen
but
torstensohn
with
his
augmented
army
penetrated
through
the
unoccupied
pass
betwixt
schleswig
and
stapelholm
met
gallas
and
drove
him
along
the
whole
course
of
the
elbe
as
far
as
bernburg
where
the
imperialists
took
up
an
entrenched
position
torstensohn
passed
the
saal
and
by
posting
himself
in
the
rear
of
the
enemy
cut
off
their
communication
with
saxony
and
bohemia
scarcity
and
famine
began
now
to
destroy
them
in
great
numbers
and
forced
them
to
retreat
to
magdeburg
where
however
they
were
not
much
better
off
the
cavalry
which
endeavoured
to
escape
into
silesia
was
overtaken
and
routed
by
torstensohn
near
juterbock
the
rest
of
the
army
after
a
vain
attempt
to
fight
its
way
through
the
swedish
lines
was
almost
wholly
destroyed
near
magdeburg
from
this
expedition
gallas
brought
back
only
a
few
thousand
men
of
all
his
formidable
force
and
the
reputation
of
being
a
consummate
master
in
the
art
of
ruining
an
army
the
king
of
denmark
after
this
unsuccessful
effort
to
relieve
him
sued
for
peace
which
he
obtained
at
bremsebor
in
the
year
under
very
unfavourable
conditions
torstensohn
rapidly
followed
up
his
victory
and
while
axel
lilienstern
one
of
the
generals
who
commanded
under
him
overawed
saxony
and
koenigsmark
subdued
the
whole
of
bremen
he
himself
penetrated
into
bohemia
with
men
and
pieces
of
artillery
and
endeavoured
a
second
time
to
remove
the
seat
of
war
into
the
hereditary
dominions
of
austria
ferdinand
upon
this
intelligence
hastened
in
person
to
prague
in
order
to
animate
the
courage
of
the
people
by
his
presence
and
as
a
skilful
general
was
much
required
and
so
little
unanimity
prevailed
among
the
numerous
leaders
he
hoped
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
war
to
be
able
to
give
more
energy
and
activity
in
obedience
to
his
orders
hatzfeldt
assembled
the
whole
austrian
and
bavarian
force
and
contrary
to
his
own
inclination
and
advice
formed
the
emperor
last
army
and
the
last
bulwark
of
his
states
in
order
of
battle
to
meet
the
enemy
who
were
approaching
at
jankowitz
on
the
of
february
ferdinand
depended
upon
his
cavalry
which
outnumbered
that
of
the
enemy
by
and
upon
the
promise
of
the
virgin
mary
who
had
appeared
to
him
in
a
dream
and
given
him
the
strongest
assurances
of
a
complete
victory
the
superiority
of
the
imperialists
did
not
intimidate
torstensohn
who
was
not
accustomed
to
number
his
antagonists
on
the
very
first
onset
the
left
wing
which
goetz
the
general
of
the
league
had
entangled
in
a
disadvantageous
position
among
marshes
and
thickets
was
totally
routed
the
general
with
the
greater
part
of
his
men
killed
and
almost
the
whole
ammunition
of
the
army
taken
this
unfortunate
commencement
decided
the
fate
of
the
day
the
swedes
constantly
advancing
successively
carried
all
the
most
commanding
heights
after
a
bloody
engagement
of
eight
hours
a
desperate
attack
on
the
part
of
the
imperial
cavalry
and
a
vigorous
resistance
by
the
swedish
infantry
the
latter
remained
in
possession
of
the
field
austrians
were
killed
upon
the
spot
and
hatzfeldt
himself
with
men
taken
prisoners
thus
on
the
same
day
did
the
emperor
lose
his
best
general
and
his
last
army
this
decisive
victory
at
jancowitz
at
once
exposed
all
the
austrian
territory
to
the
enemy
ferdinand
hastily
fled
to
vienna
to
provide
for
its
defence
and
to
save
his
family
and
his
treasures
in
a
very
short
time
the
victorious
swedes
poured
like
an
inundation
upon
moravia
and
austria
after
they
had
subdued
nearly
the
whole
of
moravia
invested
brunn
and
taken
all
the
strongholds
as
far
as
the
danube
and
carried
the
intrenchments
at
the
wolf
bridge
near
vienna
they
at
last
appeared
in
sight
of
that
capital
while
the
care
which
they
had
taken
to
fortify
their
conquests
showed
that
their
visit
was
not
likely
to
be
a
short
one
after
a
long
and
destructive
circuit
through
every
province
of
germany
the
stream
of
war
had
at
last
rolled
backwards
to
its
source
and
the
roar
of
the
swedish
artillery
now
reminded
the
terrified
inhabitants
of
those
balls
which
years
before
the
bohemian
rebels
had
fired
into
vienna
the
same
theatre
of
war
brought
again
similar
actors
on
the
scene
torstensohn
invited
ragotsky
the
successor
of
bethlen
gabor
to
his
assistance
as
the
bohemian
rebels
had
solicited
that
of
his
predecessor
upper
hungary
was
already
inundated
by
his
troops
and
his
union
with
the
swedes
was
daily
apprehended
the
elector
of
saxony
driven
to
despair
by
the
swedes
taking
up
their
quarters
within
his
territories
and
abandoned
by
the
emperor
who
after
the
defeat
at
jankowitz
was
unable
to
defend
himself
at
length
adopted
the
last
and
only
expedient
which
remained
and
concluded
a
truce
with
sweden
which
was
renewed
from
year
to
year
till
the
general
peace
the
emperor
thus
lost
a
friend
while
a
new
enemy
was
appearing
at
his
very
gates
his
armies
dispersed
and
his
allies
in
other
quarters
of
germany
defeated
the
french
army
had
effaced
the
disgrace
of
their
defeat
at
deutlingen
by
a
brilliant
campaign
and
had
kept
the
whole
force
of
bavaria
employed
upon
the
rhine
and
in
suabia
reinforced
with
fresh
troops
from
france
which
the
great
turenne
already
distinguished
by
his
victories
in
italy
brought
to
the
assistance
of
the
duke
of
enghien
they
appeared
on
the
of
august
before
friburg
which
mercy
had
lately
taken
and
now
covered
with
his
whole
army
strongly
intrenched
but
against
the
steady
firmness
of
the
bavarians
all
the
impetuous
valour
of
the
french
was
exerted
in
vain
and
after
a
fruitless
sacrifice
of
men
the
duke
of
enghien
was
compelled
to
retreat
mazarin
shed
tears
over
this
great
loss
which
conde
who
had
no
feeling
for
anything
but
glory
disregarded
a
single
night
in
paris
said
he
gives
birth
to
more
men
than
this
action
has
destroyed
the
bavarians
however
were
so
disabled
by
this
murderous
battle
that
far
from
being
in
a
condition
to
relieve
austria
from
the
menaced
dangers
they
were
too
weak
even
to
defend
the
banks
of
the
rhine
spires
worms
and
manheim
capitulated
the
strong
fortress
of
philipsburg
was
forced
to
surrender
by
famine
and
by
a
timely
submission
mentz
hastened
to
disarm
the
conquerors
austria
and
moravia
however
were
now
freed
from
torstensohn
by
a
similar
means
of
deliverance
as
in
the
beginning
of
the
war
had
saved
them
from
the
bohemians
ragotzky
at
the
head
of
men
had
advanced
into
the
neighbourhood
of
the
swedish
quarters
upon
the
danube
but
these
wild
undisciplined
hordes
instead
of
seconding
the
operations
of
torstensohn
by
any
vigorous
enterprise
only
ravaged
the
country
and
increased
the
distress
which
even
before
their
arrival
had
begun
to
be
felt
in
the
swedish
camp
to
extort
tribute
from
the
emperor
and
money
and
plunder
from
his
subjects
was
the
sole
object
that
had
allured
ragotzky
or
his
predecessor
bethlen
gabor
into
the
field
and
both
departed
as
soon
as
they
had
gained
their
end
to
get
rid
of
him
ferdinand
granted
the
barbarian
whatever
he
asked
and
by
a
small
sacrifice
freed
his
states
of
this
formidable
enemy
in
the
mean
time
the
main
body
of
the
swedes
had
been
greatly
weakened
by
a
tedious
encampment
before
brunn
torstensohn
who
commanded
in
person
for
four
entire
months
employed
in
vain
all
his
knowledge
of
military
tactics
the
obstinacy
of
the
resistance
was
equal
to
that
of
the
assault
while
despair
roused
the
courage
of
souches
the
commandant
a
swedish
deserter
who
had
no
hope
of
pardon
the
ravages
caused
by
pestilence
arising
from
famine
want
of
cleanliness
and
the
use
of
unripe
fruit
during
their
tedious
and
unhealthy
encampment
with
the
sudden
retreat
of
the
prince
of
transylvania
at
last
compelled
the
swedish
leader
to
raise
the
siege
as
all
the
passes
upon
the
danube
were
occupied
and
his
army
greatly
weakened
by
famine
and
sickness
he
at
last
relinquished
his
intended
plan
of
operations
against
austria
and
moravia
and
contented
himself
with
securing
a
key
to
these
provinces
by
leaving
behind
him
swedish
garrisons
in
the
conquered
fortresses
he
then
directed
his
march
into
bohemia
whither
he
was
followed
by
the
imperialists
under
the
archduke
leopold
such
of
the
lost
places
as
had
not
been
retaken
by
the
latter
were
recovered
after
his
departure
by
the
austrian
general
bucheim
so
that
in
the
course
of
the
following
year
the
austrian
frontier
was
again
cleared
of
the
enemy
and
vienna
escaped
with
mere
alarm
in
bohemia
and
silesia
too
the
swedes
maintained
themselves
only
with
a
very
variable
fortune
they
traversed
both
countries
without
being
able
to
hold
their
ground
in
either
but
if
the
designs
of
torstensohn
were
not
crowned
with
all
the
success
which
they
were
promised
at
the
commencement
they
were
nevertheless
productive
of
the
most
important
consequences
to
the
swedish
party
denmark
had
been
compelled
to
a
peace
saxony
to
a
truce
the
emperor
in
the
deliberations
for
a
peace
offered
greater
concessions
france
became
more
manageable
and
sweden
itself
bolder
and
more
confident
in
its
bearing
towards
these
two
crowns
having
thus
nobly
performed
his
duty
the
author
of
these
advantages
retired
adorned
with
laurels
into
the
tranquillity
of
private
life
and
endeavoured
to
restore
his
shattered
health
by
the
retreat
of
torstensohn
the
emperor
was
relieved
from
all
fears
of
an
irruption
on
the
side
of
bohemia
but
a
new
danger
soon
threatened
the
austrian
frontier
from
suabia
and
bavaria
turenne
who
had
separated
from
conde
and
taken
the
direction
of
suabia
had
in
the
year
been
totally
defeated
by
mercy
near
mergentheim
and
the
victorious
bavarians
under
their
brave
leader
poured
into
hesse
but
the
duke
of
enghien
hastened
with
considerable
succours
from
alsace
koenigsmark
from
moravia
and
the
hessians
from
the
rhine
to
recruit
the
defeated
army
and
the
bavarians
were
in
turn
compelled
to
retire
to
the
extreme
limits
of
suabia
here
they
posted
themselves
at
the
village
of
allersheim
near
nordlingen
in
order
to
cover
the
bavarian
frontier
but
no
obstacle
could
check
the
impetuosity
of
the
duke
of
enghien
in
person
he
led
on
his
troops
against
the
enemy
entrenchments
and
a
battle
took
place
which
the
heroic
resistance
of
the
bavarians
rendered
most
obstinate
and
bloody
till
at
last
the
death
of
the
great
mercy
the
skill
of
turenne
and
the
iron
firmness
of
the
hessians
decided
the
day
in
favour
of
the
allies
but
even
this
second
barbarous
sacrifice
of
life
had
little
effect
either
on
the
course
of
the
war
or
on
the
negociations
for
peace
the
french
army
exhausted
by
this
bloody
engagement
was
still
farther
weakened
by
the
departure
of
the
hessians
and
the
bavarians
being
reinforced
by
the
archduke
leopold
turenne
was
again
obliged
hastily
to
recross
the
rhine
the
retreat
of
the
french
enabled
the
enemy
to
turn
his
whole
force
upon
the
swedes
in
bohemia
gustavus
wrangel
no
unworthy
successor
of
banner
and
torstensohn
had
in
been
appointed
of
the
swedish
army
which
besides
koenigsmark
flying
corps
and
the
numerous
garrisons
disposed
throughout
the
empire
amounted
to
about
horse
and
foot
the
archduke
after
reinforcing
his
army
which
already
amounted
to
men
with
twelve
bavarian
regiments
of
cavalry
and
eighteen
regiments
of
infantry
moved
against
wrangel
in
the
hope
of
being
able
to
overwhelm
him
by
his
superior
force
before
koenigsmark
could
join
him
or
the
french
effect
a
diversion
in
his
favour
wrangel
however
did
not
await
him
but
hastened
through
upper
saxony
to
the
weser
where
he
took
hoester
and
paderborn
from
thence
he
marched
into
hesse
in
order
to
join
turenne
and
at
his
camp
at
wetzlar
was
joined
by
the
flying
corps
of
koenigsmark
but
turenne
fettered
by
the
instructions
of
mazarin
who
had
seen
with
jealousy
the
warlike
prowess
and
increasing
power
of
the
swedes
excused
himself
on
the
plea
of
a
pressing
necessity
to
defend
the
frontier
of
france
on
the
side
of
the
netherlands
in
consequence
of
the
flemings
having
failed
to
make
the
promised
diversion
but
as
wrangel
continued
to
press
his
just
demand
and
a
longer
opposition
might
have
excited
distrust
on
the
part
of
the
swedes
or
induce
them
to
conclude
a
private
treaty
with
austria
turenne
at
last
obtained
the
wished
for
permission
to
join
the
swedish
army
the
junction
took
place
at
giessen
and
they
now
felt
themselves
strong
enough
to
meet
the
enemy
the
latter
had
followed
the
swedes
into
hesse
in
order
to
intercept
their
commissariat
and
to
prevent
their
union
with
turenne
in
both
designs
they
had
been
unsuccessful
and
the
imperialists
now
saw
themselves
cut
off
from
the
maine
and
exposed
to
great
scarcity
and
want
from
the
loss
of
their
magazines
wrangel
took
advantage
of
their
weakness
to
execute
a
plan
by
which
he
hoped
to
give
a
new
turn
to
the
war
he
too
had
adopted
the
maxim
of
his
predecessor
to
carry
the
war
into
the
austrian
states
but
discouraged
by
the
ill
success
of
torstensohn
enterprise
he
hoped
to
gain
his
end
with
more
certainty
by
another
way
he
determined
to
follow
the
course
of
the
danube
and
to
break
into
the
austrian
territories
through
the
midst
of
bavaria
a
similar
design
had
been
formerly
conceived
by
gustavus
adolphus
which
he
had
been
prevented
carrying
into
effect
by
the
approach
of
wallenstein
army
and
the
danger
of
saxony
duke
bernard
moving
in
his
footsteps
and
more
fortunate
than
gustavus
had
spread
his
victorious
banners
between
the
iser
and
the
inn
but
the
near
approach
of
the
enemy
vastly
superior
in
force
obliged
him
to
halt
in
his
victorious
career
and
lead
back
his
troops
wrangel
now
hoped
to
accomplish
the
object
in
which
his
predecessors
had
failed
the
more
so
as
the
imperial
and
bavarian
army
was
far
in
his
rear
upon
the
lahn
and
could
only
reach
bavaria
by
a
long
march
through
franconia
and
the
upper
palatinate
he
moved
hastily
upon
the
danube
defeated
a
bavarian
corps
near
donauwerth
and
passed
that
river
as
well
as
the
lech
unopposed
but
by
wasting
his
time
in
the
unsuccessful
siege
of
augsburg
he
gave
opportunity
to
the
imperialists
not
only
to
relieve
that
city
but
also
to
repulse
him
as
far
as
lauingen
no
sooner
however
had
they
turned
towards
suabia
with
a
view
to
remove
the
war
from
bavaria
than
seizing
the
opportunity
he
repassed
the
lech
and
guarded
the
passage
of
it
against
the
imperialists
themselves
bavaria
now
lay
open
and
defenceless
before
him
the
french
and
swedes
quickly
overran
it
and
the
soldiery
indemnified
themselves
for
all
dangers
by
frightful
outrages
robberies
and
extortions
the
arrival
of
the
imperial
troops
who
at
last
succeeded
in
passing
the
lech
at
thierhaupten
only
increased
the
misery
of
this
country
which
friend
and
foe
indiscriminately
plundered
and
now
for
the
first
time
during
the
whole
course
of
this
war
the
courage
of
maximilian
which
for
years
had
stood
unshaken
amidst
fearful
dangers
began
to
waver
ferdinand
his
at
ingoldstadt
and
the
friend
of
his
youth
was
no
more
and
with
the
death
of
his
friend
and
benefactor
the
strong
tie
was
dissolved
which
had
linked
the
elector
to
the
house
of
austria
to
the
father
habit
inclination
and
gratitude
had
attached
him
the
son
was
a
stranger
to
his
heart
and
political
interests
alone
could
preserve
his
fidelity
to
the
latter
prince
accordingly
the
motives
which
the
artifices
of
france
now
put
in
operation
in
order
to
detach
him
from
the
austrian
alliance
and
to
induce
him
to
lay
down
his
arms
were
drawn
entirely
from
political
considerations
it
was
not
without
a
selfish
object
that
mazarin
had
so
far
overcome
his
jealousy
of
the
growing
power
of
the
swedes
as
to
allow
the
french
to
accompany
them
into
bavaria
his
intention
was
to
expose
bavaria
to
all
the
horrors
of
war
in
the
hope
that
the
persevering
fortitude
of
maximilian
might
be
subdued
by
necessity
and
despair
and
the
emperor
deprived
of
his
first
and
last
ally
brandenburg
had
under
its
great
sovereign
embraced
the
neutrality
saxony
had
been
forced
to
accede
to
it
the
war
with
france
prevented
the
spaniards
from
taking
any
part
in
that
of
germany
the
peace
with
sweden
had
removed
denmark
from
the
theatre
of
war
and
poland
had
been
disarmed
by
a
long
truce
if
they
could
succeed
in
detaching
the
elector
of
bavaria
also
from
the
austrian
alliance
the
emperor
would
be
without
a
friend
in
germany
and
left
to
the
mercy
of
the
allied
powers
ferdinand
iii
saw
his
danger
and
left
no
means
untried
to
avert
it
but
the
elector
of
bavaria
was
unfortunately
led
to
believe
that
the
spaniards
alone
were
disinclined
to
peace
and
that
nothing
but
spanish
influence
had
induced
the
emperor
so
long
to
resist
a
cessation
of
hostilities
maximilian
detested
the
spaniards
and
could
never
forgive
their
having
opposed
his
application
for
the
palatine
electorate
could
it
then
be
supposed
that
in
order
to
gratify
this
hated
power
he
would
see
his
people
sacrificed
his
country
laid
waste
and
himself
ruined
when
by
a
cessation
of
hostilities
he
could
at
once
emancipate
himself
from
all
these
distresses
procure
for
his
people
the
repose
of
which
they
stood
so
much
in
need
and
perhaps
accelerate
the
arrival
of
a
general
peace
all
doubts
disappeared
and
convinced
of
the
necessity
of
this
step
he
thought
he
should
sufficiently
discharge
his
obligations
to
the
emperor
if
he
invited
him
also
to
share
in
the
benefit
of
the
truce
the
deputies
of
the
three
crowns
and
of
bavaria
met
at
ulm
to
adjust
the
conditions
but
it
was
soon
evident
from
the
instructions
of
the
austrian
ambassadors
that
it
was
not
the
intention
of
the
emperor
to
second
the
conclusion
of
a
truce
but
if
possible
to
prevent
it
it
was
obviously
necessary
to
make
the
terms
acceptable
to
the
swedes
who
had
the
advantage
and
had
more
to
hope
than
to
fear
from
the
continuance
of
the
war
they
were
the
conquerors
and
yet
the
emperor
presumed
to
dictate
to
them
in
the
first
transports
of
their
indignation
the
swedish
ambassadors
were
on
the
point
of
leaving
the
congress
and
the
french
were
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
threats
in
order
to
detain
them
the
good
intentions
of
the
elector
of
bavaria
to
include
the
emperor
in
the
benefit
of
the
truce
having
been
thus
rendered
unavailing
he
felt
himself
justified
in
providing
for
his
own
safety
however
hard
were
the
conditions
on
which
the
truce
was
to
be
purchased
he
did
not
hesitate
to
accept
it
on
any
terms
he
agreed
to
the
swedes
extending
their
quarters
in
suabia
and
franconia
and
to
his
own
being
restricted
to
bavaria
and
the
palatinate
the
conquests
which
he
had
made
in
suabia
were
ceded
to
the
allies
who
on
their
part
restored
to
him
what
they
had
taken
from
bavaria
cologne
and
hesse
cassel
were
also
included
in
the
truce
after
the
conclusion
of
this
treaty
upon
the
march
the
french
and
swedes
left
bavaria
and
in
order
not
to
interfere
with
each
other
took
up
different
quarters
the
former
in
wuertemberg
the
latter
in
upper
suabia
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
lake
of
constance
on
the
extreme
north
of
this
lake
and
on
the
most
southern
frontier
of
suabia
the
austrian
town
of
bregentz
by
its
steep
and
narrow
passes
seemed
to
defy
attack
and
in
this
persuasion
the
whole
peasantry
of
the
surrounding
villages
had
with
their
property
taken
refuge
in
this
natural
fortress
the
rich
booty
which
the
store
of
provisions
it
contained
gave
reason
to
expect
and
the
advantage
of
possessing
a
pass
into
the
tyrol
switzerland
and
italy
induced
the
swedish
general
to
venture
an
attack
upon
this
supposed
impregnable
post
and
town
in
which
he
succeeded
meantime
turenne
according
to
agreement
marched
into
wuertemberg
where
he
forced
the
landgrave
of
darmstadt
and
the
elector
of
mentz
to
imitate
the
example
of
bavaria
and
to
embrace
the
neutrality
and
now
at
last
france
seemed
to
have
attained
the
great
object
of
its
policy
that
of
depriving
the
emperor
of
the
support
of
the
league
and
of
his
protestant
allies
and
of
dictating
to
him
sword
in
hand
the
conditions
of
peace
of
all
his
once
formidable
power
an
army
not
exceeding
was
all
that
remained
to
him
and
this
force
he
was
driven
to
the
necessity
of
entrusting
to
the
command
of
a
calvinist
the
hessian
deserter
melander
as
the
casualties
of
war
had
stripped
him
of
his
best
generals
but
as
this
war
had
been
remarkable
for
the
sudden
changes
of
fortune
it
displayed
and
as
every
calculation
of
state
policy
had
been
frequently
baffled
by
some
unforeseen
event
in
this
case
also
the
issue
disappointed
expectation
and
after
a
brief
crisis
the
fallen
power
of
austria
rose
again
to
a
formidable
strength
the
jealousy
which
france
entertained
of
sweden
prevented
it
from
permitting
the
total
ruin
of
the
emperor
or
allowing
the
swedes
to
obtain
such
a
preponderance
in
germany
as
might
have
been
destructive
to
france
herself
accordingly
the
french
minister
declined
to
take
advantage
of
the
distresses
of
austria
and
the
army
of
turenne
separating
from
that
of
wrangel
retired
to
the
frontiers
of
the
netherlands
wrangel
indeed
after
moving
from
suabia
into
franconia
taking
schweinfurt
and
incorporating
the
imperial
garrison
of
that
place
with
his
own
army
attempted
to
make
his
way
into
bohemia
and
laid
siege
to
egra
the
key
of
that
kingdom
to
relieve
this
fortress
the
emperor
put
his
last
army
in
motion
and
placed
himself
at
its
head
but
obliged
to
take
a
long
circuit
in
order
to
spare
the
lands
of
von
schlick
the
president
of
the
council
of
war
he
protracted
his
march
and
on
his
arrival
egra
was
already
taken
both
armies
were
now
in
sight
of
each
other
and
a
decisive
battle
was
momentarily
expected
as
both
were
suffering
from
want
and
the
two
camps
were
only
separated
from
each
other
by
the
space
of
the
entrenchments
but
the
imperialists
although
superior
in
numbers
contented
themselves
with
keeping
close
to
the
enemy
and
harassing
them
by
skirmishes
by
fatiguing
marches
and
famine
until
the
negociations
which
had
been
opened
with
bavaria
were
brought
to
a
bearing
the
neutrality
of
bavaria
was
a
wound
under
which
the
imperial
court
writhed
impatiently
and
after
in
vain
attempting
to
prevent
it
austria
now
determined
if
possible
to
turn
it
to
advantage
several
officers
of
the
bavarian
army
had
been
offended
by
this
step
of
their
master
which
at
once
reduced
them
to
inaction
and
imposed
a
burdensome
restraint
on
their
restless
disposition
even
the
brave
john
de
werth
was
at
the
head
of
the
malcontents
and
encouraged
by
the
emperor
he
formed
a
plot
to
seduce
the
whole
army
from
their
allegiance
to
the
elector
and
lead
it
over
to
the
emperor
ferdinand
did
not
blush
to
patronize
this
act
of
treachery
against
his
father
most
trusty
ally
he
formally
issued
a
proclamation
to
the
bavarian
troops
in
which
he
recalled
them
to
himself
reminded
them
that
they
were
the
troops
of
the
empire
which
the
elector
had
merely
commanded
in
name
of
the
emperor
fortunately
for
maximilian
he
detected
the
conspiracy
in
time
enough
to
anticipate
and
prevent
it
by
the
most
rapid
and
effective
measures
this
disgraceful
conduct
of
the
emperor
might
have
justified
a
reprisal
but
maximilian
was
too
old
a
statesman
to
listen
to
the
voice
of
passion
where
policy
alone
ought
to
be
heard
he
had
not
derived
from
the
truce
the
advantages
he
expected
far
from
tending
to
accelerate
a
general
peace
it
had
a
pernicious
influence
upon
the
negociations
at
munster
and
osnaburg
and
had
made
the
allies
bolder
in
their
demands
the
french
and
swedes
had
indeed
removed
from
bavaria
but
by
the
loss
of
his
quarters
in
the
suabian
circle
he
found
himself
compelled
either
to
exhaust
his
own
territories
by
the
subsistence
of
his
troops
or
at
once
to
disband
them
and
to
throw
aside
the
shield
and
spear
at
the
very
moment
when
the
sword
alone
seemed
to
be
the
arbiter
of
right
before
embracing
either
of
these
certain
evils
he
determined
to
try
a
third
step
the
unfavourable
issue
of
which
was
at
least
not
so
certain
to
renounce
the
truce
and
resume
the
war
this
resolution
and
the
assistance
which
he
immediately
despatched
to
the
emperor
in
bohemia
threatened
materially
to
injure
the
swedes
and
wrangel
was
compelled
in
haste
to
evacuate
that
kingdom
he
retired
through
thuringia
into
westphalia
and
lunenburg
in
the
hope
of
forming
a
junction
with
the
french
army
under
turenne
while
the
imperial
and
bavarian
army
followed
him
to
the
weser
under
melander
and
gronsfeld
his
ruin
was
inevitable
if
the
enemy
should
overtake
him
before
his
junction
with
turenne
but
the
same
consideration
which
had
just
saved
the
emperor
now
proved
the
salvation
of
the
swedes
even
amidst
all
the
fury
of
the
conquest
cold
calculations
of
prudence
guided
the
course
of
the
war
and
the
vigilance
of
the
different
courts
increased
as
the
prospect
of
peace
approached
the
elector
of
bavaria
could
not
allow
the
emperor
to
obtain
so
decisive
a
preponderance
as
by
the
sudden
alteration
of
affairs
might
delay
the
chances
of
a
general
peace
every
change
of
fortune
was
important
now
when
a
pacification
was
so
ardently
desired
by
all
and
when
the
disturbance
of
the
balance
of
power
among
the
contracting
parties
might
at
once
annihilate
the
work
of
years
destroy
the
fruit
of
long
and
tedious
negociations
and
indefinitely
protract
the
repose
of
europe
if
france
sought
to
restrain
the
swedish
crown
within
due
bounds
and
measured
out
her
assistance
according
to
her
successes
and
defeats
the
elector
of
bavaria
silently
undertook
the
same
task
with
the
emperor
his
ally
and
determined
by
prudently
dealing
out
his
aid
to
hold
the
fate
of
austria
in
his
own
hands
and
now
that
the
power
of
the
emperor
threatened
once
more
to
attain
a
dangerous
superiority
maximilian
at
once
ceased
to
pursue
the
swedes
he
was
also
afraid
of
reprisals
from
france
who
had
threatened
to
direct
turenne
whole
force
against
him
if
he
allowed
his
troops
to
cross
the
weser
melander
prevented
by
the
bavarians
from
further
pursuing
wrangel
crossed
by
jena
and
erfurt
into
hesse
and
now
appeared
as
a
dangerous
enemy
in
the
country
which
he
had
formerly
defended
if
it
was
the
desire
of
revenge
upon
his
former
sovereign
which
led
him
to
choose
hesse
for
the
scene
of
his
ravage
he
certainly
had
his
full
gratification
under
this
scourge
the
miseries
of
that
unfortunate
state
reached
their
height
but
he
had
soon
reason
to
regret
that
in
the
choice
of
his
quarters
he
had
listened
to
the
dictates
of
revenge
rather
than
of
prudence
in
this
exhausted
country
his
army
was
oppressed
by
want
while
wrangel
was
recruiting
his
strength
and
remounting
his
cavalry
in
lunenburg
too
weak
to
maintain
his
wretched
quarters
against
the
swedish
general
when
he
opened
the
campaign
in
the
winter
of
and
marched
against
hesse
he
was
obliged
to
retire
with
disgrace
and
take
refuge
on
the
banks
of
the
danube
france
had
once
more
disappointed
the
expectations
of
sweden
and
the
army
of
turenne
disregarding
the
remonstrances
of
wrangel
had
remained
upon
the
rhine
the
swedish
leader
revenged
himself
by
drawing
into
his
service
the
cavalry
of
weimar
which
had
abandoned
the
standard
of
france
though
by
this
step
he
farther
increased
the
jealousy
of
that
power
turenne
received
permission
to
join
the
swedes
and
the
last
campaign
of
this
eventful
war
was
now
opened
by
the
united
armies
driving
melander
before
them
along
the
danube
they
threw
supplies
into
egra
which
was
besieged
by
the
imperialists
and
defeated
the
imperial
and
bavarian
armies
on
the
danube
which
ventured
to
oppose
them
at
susmarshausen
where
melander
was
mortally
wounded
after
this
overthrow
the
bavarian
general
gronsfeld
placed
himself
on
the
farther
side
of
the
lech
in
order
to
guard
bavaria
from
the
enemy
but
gronsfeld
was
not
more
fortunate
than
tilly
who
in
this
same
position
had
sacrificed
his
life
for
bavaria
wrangel
and
turenne
chose
the
same
spot
for
passing
the
river
which
was
so
gloriously
marked
by
the
victory
of
gustavus
adolphus
and
accomplished
it
by
the
same
means
too
which
had
favoured
their
predecessor
bavaria
was
now
a
second
time
overrun
and
the
breach
of
the
truce
punished
by
the
severest
treatment
of
its
inhabitants
maximilian
sought
shelter
in
salzburgh
while
the
swedes
crossed
the
iser
and
forced
their
way
as
far
as
the
inn
a
violent
and
continued
rain
which
in
a
few
days
swelled
this
inconsiderable
stream
into
a
broad
river
saved
austria
once
more
from
the
threatened
danger
the
enemy
ten
times
attempted
to
form
a
bridge
of
boats
over
the
inn
and
as
often
it
was
destroyed
by
the
current
never
during
the
whole
course
of
the
war
had
the
imperialists
been
in
so
great
consternation
as
at
present
when
the
enemy
were
in
the
centre
of
bavaria
and
when
they
had
no
longer
a
general
left
who
could
be
matched
against
a
turenne
a
wrangel
and
a
koenigsmark
at
last
the
brave
piccolomini
arrived
from
the
netherlands
to
assume
the
command
of
the
feeble
wreck
of
the
imperialists
by
their
own
ravages
in
bohemia
the
allies
had
rendered
their
subsistence
in
that
country
impracticable
and
were
at
last
driven
by
scarcity
to
retreat
into
the
upper
palatinate
where
the
news
of
the
peace
put
a
period
to
their
activity
koenigsmark
with
his
flying
corps
advanced
towards
bohemia
where
ernest
odowalsky
a
disbanded
captain
who
after
being
disabled
in
the
imperial
service
had
been
dismissed
without
a
pension
laid
before
him
a
plan
for
surprising
the
lesser
side
of
the
city
of
prague
koenigsmark
successfully
accomplished
the
bold
enterprise
and
acquired
the
reputation
of
closing
the
thirty
years
war
by
the
last
brilliant
achievement
this
decisive
stroke
which
vanquished
the
emperor
irresolution
cost
the
swedes
only
the
loss
of
a
single
man
but
the
old
town
the
larger
half
of
prague
which
is
divided
into
two
parts
by
the
moldau
by
its
vigorous
resistance
wearied
out
the
efforts
of
the
palatine
charles
gustavus
the
successor
of
christina
on
the
throne
who
had
arrived
from
sweden
with
fresh
troops
and
had
assembled
the
whole
swedish
force
in
bohemia
and
silesia
before
its
walls
the
approach
of
winter
at
last
drove
the
besiegers
into
their
quarters
and
in
the
mean
time
the
intelligence
arrived
that
a
peace
had
been
signed
at
munster
on
the
october
the
colossal
labour
of
concluding
this
solemn
and
ever
memorable
and
sacred
treaty
which
is
known
by
the
name
of
the
peace
of
westphalia
the
endless
obstacles
which
were
to
be
surmounted
the
contending
interests
which
it
was
necessary
to
reconcile
the
concatenation
of
circumstances
which
must
have
to
bring
to
a
favourable
termination
this
tedious
but
precious
and
permanent
work
of
policy
the
difficulties
which
beset
the
very
opening
of
the
negociations
and
maintaining
them
when
opened
during
the
vicissitudes
of
the
war
finally
arranging
the
conditions
of
peace
and
still
more
the
carrying
them
into
effect
what
were
the
conditions
of
this
peace
what
each
contending
power
gained
or
lost
by
the
toils
and
sufferings
of
a
thirty
years
war
what
modification
it
wrought
upon
the
general
system
of
european
policy
these
are
matters
which
must
be
relinquished
to
another
pen
the
history
of
the
peace
of
westphalia
constitutes
a
whole
as
important
as
the
history
of
the
war
itself
a
mere
abridgment
of
it
would
reduce
to
a
mere
skeleton
one
of
the
most
interesting
and
characteristic
monuments
of
human
policy
and
passions
and
deprive
it
of
every
feature
calculated

fix
the
attention
of
the
