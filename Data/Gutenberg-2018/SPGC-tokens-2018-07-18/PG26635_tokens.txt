you
know
i
married
you
principally
for
a
and
that
in
loving
memory
of
howard
taylor
widdemer
the
husband
i
the
liberry
teacher
lifted
her
eyes
from
a
eyed
the
relentlessly
slow
clock
and
checked
a
long
wriggle
of
purest
frankest
weariness
then
she
gave
a
furtive
glance
around
to
see
if
the
children
had
noticed
she
was
off
guard
for
if
they
had
she
knew
the
whole
crowd
might
take
more
liberties
than
they
ought
to
and
have
to
be
spoken
to
by
the
janitor
he
could
do
a
great
deal
with
them
because
he
understood
their
attitude
to
life
but
that
was
good
for
the
liberry
teacher
record
it
was
four
of
a
stickily
wet
saturday
as
long
as
it
is
anything
from
monday
to
friday
the
average
library
attendant
goes
around
thanking
her
stars
she
is
a
but
the
last
day
of
the
week
when
the
rest
of
the
world
is
having
its
relaxing
saturday
off
and
coming
to
gloat
over
you
as
it
acquires
its
best
seller
if
you
work
in
a
library
you
begin
just
at
noon
to
wish
devoutly
that
you
taken
up
or
or
or
anything
on
earth
that
gave
you
a
weekly
so
the
liberry
teacher
braced
herself
severely
and
put
on
her
with
a
view
to
looking
older
and
more
firm
liberry
teacher
it
might
be
well
to
explain
was
not
her
official
title
her
description
on
the
ran
assistant
for
the
department
greenway
branch
city
public
library
people
when
she
happened
to
run
across
them
called
her
miss
braithwaite
but
liberry
teacher
was
the
only
name
the
children
ever
used
and
she
saw
scarcely
anybody
but
the
children
six
days
a
week
weeks
a
year
as
for
her
real
name
that
nobody
ever
called
her
by
was
phyllis
narcissa
she
was
quite
willing
to
have
such
a
name
as
that
buried
out
of
sight
she
had
a
sense
of
fitness
and
such
a
name
belonged
back
in
an
old
new
england
parsonage
garden
full
of
pink
roses
and
nice
green
caterpillars
and
and
the
days
before
she
was
eighteen
not
in
a
smutty
city
library
attached
to
a
young
woman
with
and
fine
discipline
and
a
woolen
it
was
that
the
liberry
teacher
did
like
her
position
she
not
only
liked
it
but
she
had
a
great
deal
of
admiration
for
it
because
it
had
been
exceedingly
hard
to
get
she
had
held
it
firmly
now
for
a
whole
year
before
that
she
had
been
in
the
cataloguing
where
your
eyes
hurt
and
you
get
a
little
pain
between
your
shoulders
but
you
sit
down
and
can
talk
to
other
girls
and
before
that
in
the
circulation
where
it
hurts
your
feet
and
you
get
ink
on
your
fingers
but
you
see
lots
of
funny
things
happening
she
had
started
at
eighteen
years
old
at
thirty
dollars
a
month
now
she
was
and
she
got
all
of
fifty
dollars
so
she
ought
to
have
been
a
very
happy
liberry
teacher
indeed
and
generally
she
was
when
the
children
wanted
to
specify
her
particularly
they
described
her
as
the
pretty
one
that
laughs
but
at
four
of
a
wet
saturday
afternoon
in
a
badly
ventilated
badly
lighted
room
full
of
damp
little
unwashed
foreign
children
even
the
most
liberry
teacher
may
be
excused
for
having
thoughts
that
are
a
little
tired
and
cross
and
restless
she
flung
herself
back
in
her
and
watched
with
brazen
indifference
giovanni
and
liberata
bruno
stickily
pawing
the
colored
bird
book
that
was
supposed
to
be
looked
at
only
under
supervision
she
ignored
the
fact
that
three
little
czechs
were
fighting
over
the
wailing
library
cat
and
the
sounds
of
conflict
caused
by
jimsy
hoolan
desire
to
get
the
alger
book
away
from
john
zanowski
moved
her
not
a
whit
the
liberry
teacher
had
stopped
for
five
minutes
being
and
responsible
and
she
was
wishing
wishing
hard
and
vengefully
this
is
always
a
risky
thing
to
do
because
you
never
know
when
the
destinies
may
overhear
you
and
take
you
at
your
exact
word
with
the
detailed
and
careful
accuracy
one
acquires
in
library
work
she
was
wishing
for
a
sum
of
money
a
garden
and
a
husband
but
principally
a
husband
this
is
why
that
day
as
she
was
returning
from
her
she
had
charged
umbrella
down
almost
full
into
a
pretty
lady
getting
out
of
a
shiny
gray
limousine
such
an
unnecessarily
pretty
lady
all
furs
and
fluffles
and
veils
and
perfumes
and
waved
hair
her
cheeks
were
pink
and
her
expression
was
placid
and
each
of
her
hands
held
tight
to
a
pretty
child
who
was
wriggling
with
wild
excitement
one
had
yellow
frilly
hair
and
one
had
brown
bobbed
hair
and
both
were
quaintly
immaculately
expensively
kissable
they
were
the
kind
of
children
every
girl
wishes
she
could
have
a
set
like
and
hugs
when
she
gets
a
chance
mother
and
children
were
making
their
way
under
an
awning
that
crossed
the
street
to
the
matinee
of
a
the
liberry
teacher
smiled
at
the
children
with
more
than
her
accustomed
goodwill
and
lowered
her
umbrella
quickly
to
let
them
pass
the
mother
smiled
back
a
smile
that
changed
as
the
liberry
teacher
passed
to
puzzled
remembrance
the
gay
little
family
went
on
into
the
theatre
and
phyllis
braithwaite
hurried
on
back
to
her
work
trying
to
think
who
the
pretty
lady
could
have
been
to
have
seemed
to
almost
remember
her
somebody
who
took
books
out
of
the
library
doubtless
still
the
pretty
lady
face
did
not
seem
to
fit
that
conjecture
though
it
still
worried
her
by
its
vague
familiarity
finally
the
solution
came
just
as
phyllis
was
pulling
off
her
raincoat
in
the
dark
little
she
nearly
dropped
the
coat
eva
atkinson
she
said
eva
atkinson
if
it
had
been
anybody
else
but
you
see
back
in
in
the
little
leisurely
windblown
new
england
town
where
phyllis
braithwaite
had
lived
till
she
was
almost
eighteen
there
had
been
a
principal
grocer
and
eva
atkinson
had
been
his
daughter
not
so
very
pretty
not
so
very
pleasant
not
so
very
clever
and
about
six
years
older
than
phyllis
phyllis
as
she
tried
vainly
to
make
her
damp
straight
hair
go
back
the
way
it
should
remembered
hearing
that
eva
had
married
and
come
to
this
city
to
live
she
had
never
heard
where
and
this
had
been
eva
eva
by
the
grace
of
gold
radiantly
complexioned
wonderfully
groomed
beautifully
gowned
and
looking
perhaps
at
most
with
a
car
and
a
placid
expression
and
of
money
and
pretty
clean
children
the
liberry
teacher
severely
and
jerked
herself
away
from
the
small
greenish
mirror
that
was
unkind
to
you
at
your
best
she
dashed
down
to
the
basement
harried
by
her
usual
feeling
she
had
only
taken
one
glance
at
herself
in
the
wiggly
mirror
but
that
one
had
been
enough
for
her
peace
of
mind
supposing
her
to
have
had
any
left
before
she
felt
as
if
she
wanted
to
break
all
the
mirrors
in
the
world
like
the
wicked
queen
in
the
french
most
people
rather
liked
the
face
phyllis
saw
in
the
mirror
but
to
her
own
eyes
fresh
from
the
dazzling
vision
of
that
eva
atkinson
who
had
been
dowdy
and
stupid
in
the
time
when
phyllis
was
growin
up
as
pretty
as
a
picture
the
tired
workaday
face
in
the
green
glass
was
what
made
her
feel
worst
and
she
entertained
the
thought
with
a
whimsical
consciousness
of
its
impertinent
vanity
was
that
she
had
so
much
more
raw
material
than
eva
and
the
world
had
given
eva
a
chance
because
her
father
was
rich
and
she
phyllis
was
condemned
to
be
tidy
and
accurate
and
no
more
just
because
she
had
to
earn
her
living
that
face
in
the
greenish
glass
looking
tiredly
back
at
her
she
gave
a
little
cry
of
vexation
now
as
she
thought
of
it
two
hours
later
i
must
have
looked
to
eva
like
a
battered
bisque
doll
no
wonder
she
could
place
me
she
muttered
crossly
and
it
must
be
worse
and
more
of
it
now
because
in
the
interval
between
two
and
four
there
had
been
many
little
sticky
fingers
pulling
at
her
sleeves
and
skirt
and
you
just
to
cuddle
dear
little
library
children
even
when
they
not
extra
clean
and
when
vera
aronsohn
burst
into
heartbroken
tears
on
the
liberry
teacher
blue
woolen
shoulder
because
her
pet
was
missing
she
had
caught
several
strands
of
the
teacher
yellow
hair
in
her
anguish
much
to
the
detriment
it
was
straight
heavy
hair
and
it
would
have
been
of
a
dense
and
fluffy
only
that
it
was
tarnished
for
lack
of
the
constant
sunnings
and
brushings
which
blonde
hair
must
have
to
stay
its
best
self
and
her
skin
too
that
should
have
been
a
living
was
dulled
by
exposure
to
all
weathers
and
lack
of
time
to
pet
it
with
creams
and
powders
perhaps
a
little
too
by
the
very
stupid
things
to
eat
one
gets
at
a
and
some
of
the
assistants
did
interesting
cooking
over
the
library
but
the
liberry
teacher
could
do
that
because
she
had
time
she
went
on
defiantly
thinking
about
her
looks
it
is
a
thing
to
do
but
when
you
might
be
so
very
very
pretty
if
you
only
had
a
little
time
to
be
it
in
yes
i
said
phyllis
to
her
shocked
self
defiantly
yes
the
shape
of
her
face
was
all
right
still
hard
work
and
scant
attention
could
spoil
its
pretty
oval
but
her
eyes
well
you
ca
keep
your
eyes
as
blue
and
luminous
and
childlike
as
they
were
back
in
the
new
england
country
when
you
have
been
using
them
hard
for
years
in
a
bad
light
and
oh
they
had
been
such
eyes
when
she
was
just
phyllis
narcissa
at
home
so
long
and
blue
and
wondering
and
now
the
cataloguing
had
heavied
the
lids
and
etched
a
line
between
her
straight
brown
brows
they
were
decorative
eyes
now
and
they
filled
with
indignant
the
liberry
teacher
laughed
at
herself
a
little
here
the
idea
of
eyes
that
cried
about
themselves
was
funny
somehow
direct
from
producer
to
consumer
she
quoted
and
wiped
each
eye
conscientiously
by
itself
teacher
i
want
a
liberry
called
of
lemon
hill
demanded
a
small
citizen
just
here
the
school
teacher
she
says
i
must
to
have
it
phyllis
thought
hard
but
she
had
to
search
the
list
of
required
reading
for
schools
for
three
solid
minutes
before
she
bestowed
the
bride
of
lammermoor
on
a
daughter
of
hungary
this
is
it
is
it
honey
she
asked
with
the
flashing
smile
for
which
her
children
among
other
things
adored
her
yes
thank
you
teacher
said
the
gratefully
and
went
off
to
a
corner
where
she
sat
till
closing
time
entranced
over
her
own
happy
choice
the
adventures
of
peter
rabbit
with
colored
pictures
dotting
it
satisfactorily
the
liberry
teacher
knew
that
it
was
her
duty
to
go
over
and
hypnotize
the
child
into
reading
something
which
would
lead
more
directly
to
browning
and
strindberg
but
she
did
poor
little
wop
she
thought
unacademically
let
her
be
happy
in
her
own
way
and
the
liberry
teacher
herself
went
on
being
unhappy
in
own
way
i
just
a
battered
bisque
doll
she
repeated
to
herself
bitterly
but
she
was
wrong
one
is
apt
to
exaggerate
things
on
a
workaday
saturday
afternoon
she
looked
more
like
a
pretty
bisque
figurine
slim
and
and
a
little
neglected
perhaps
by
its
owners
and
dressed
in
working
clothes
instead
of
the
pretty
draperies
it
should
have
had
but
needing
only
a
touch
or
so
a
little
dusting
so
to
speak
to
be
as
good
as
ever
eva
was
as
pretty
as
i
was
her
rebellious
thoughts
went
on
you
think
things
you
know
that
you
never
say
aloud
i
sick
of
elevating
the
public
i
sick
of
working
hard
weeks
out
of
for
board
and
lodging
and
carfare
and
shirtwaists
and
the
occasional
society
of
a
few
girls
who
do
get
any
more
out
of
life
than
i
do
i
sick
of
libraries
and
of
being
efficient
i
want
to
be
a
real
girl
oh
i
wish
i
wish
i
had
a
lot
of
money
and
a
and
a
the
liberry
teacher
was
aghast
at
herself
she
had
meant
to
wish
such
a
very
unmaidenly
thing
so
hard
she
jumped
up
and
dashed
across
the
room
and
began
frantically
to
books
explaining
meanwhile
with
most
violent
emphasis
to
the
listening
destinies
i
did
oh
i
mean
a
husband
it
is
that
i
yearn
to
be
married
to
some
good
man
like
an
old
maid
or
a
duchess
novel
i
i
just
want
all
the
lovely
things
eva
has
or
any
girl
that
them
without
any
trouble
but
taking
care
of
a
man
one
man
but
be
easier
than
a
whole
roomful
of
library
babies
i
want
to
be
looked
after
and
have
time
to
keep
pretty
and
a
chance
to
make
friends
and
lovely
frocks
with
lots
of
lace
on
them
and
just
months
and
months
and
months
when
i
never
had
to
do
anything
by
a
clock
and
and
a
this
last
idea
was
dangerous
it
is
a
good
thing
if
you
want
to
be
contented
with
your
lot
to
think
of
in
a
stuffy
city
library
o
saturdays
especially
when
where
you
were
brought
up
were
one
of
the
common
necessities
of
life
and
more
especially
when
you
are
tired
almost
to
the
and
have
all
the
week
big
sisters
back
of
it
dragging
on
you
and
all
its
little
sisters
to
come
worrying
at
you
and
time
not
up
till
six
but
the
liberry
teacher
went
blindly
on
straightening
shelves
nearly
as
fast
as
the
children
could
muss
them
up
and
thinking
about
that
she
wanted
with
files
of
masseuses
and
manicures
and
french
maids
and
with
boxes
banked
soothingly
behind
every
bush
and
the
thought
became
too
beautiful
to
dally
with
i
marry
that
would
give
me
a
reiterated
the
liberry
teacher
passionately
to
the
destinies
who
are
rather
catty
ladies
and
apt
to
catch
up
unguarded
remarks
you
make
so
long
as
it
was
a
gentleman
and
he
did
scold
me
and
and
i
have
to
associate
with
him
her
new
england
maidenliness
added
in
haste
then
for
the
librarian
who
can
not
laugh
like
the
one
who
reads
is
supposed
in
library
circles
to
be
lost
phyllis
shook
herself
and
laughed
at
herself
a
little
bravely
then
she
collected
the
most
uproarious
of
her
flock
around
her
and
began
telling
them
stories
out
of
the
merry
adventures
of
robin
hood
it
would
keep
the
children
quiet
and
her
thoughts
too
she
put
not
to
say
manicurists
and
husbands
severely
out
of
her
head
but
you
ca
play
fast
and
loose
with
the
destinies
that
way
done
they
had
replied
quietly
to
her
last
schedule
of
requirements
we
send
our
messenger
over
right
away
it
was
not
their
fault
that
the
liberry
teacher
could
not
hear
them
ii
he
was
curvingly
and
immaculately
and
he
did
not
look
in
the
least
like
a
messenger
of
fate
the
liberry
teacher
was
at
a
highly
keyed
part
of
her
narrative
and
even
the
most
fidgety
children
were
tense
and
where
art
thou
now
cried
the
stranger
to
robin
hood
and
robin
roared
with
laughter
in
the
flood
and
floating
down
the
stream
with
all
the
little
fishes
said
he
she
was
relating
breathlessly
hissed
isaac
rabinowitz
snapping
his
fingers
at
her
at
this
exciting
point
teacher
there
a
guy
wants
to
speak
to
you
aw
chorused
his
indignant
little
schoolmates
ca
you
see

a
small
polish
jew
with
tragic
dark
eyes
and
one
suspender
received
these
and
several
more
such
suggestions
with
all
the
calm
impenetrability
of
his
race
here
de
guy
was
all
he
vouchsafed
before
he
went
back
to
the
unsocial
nook
where
afternoon
by
faithful
afternoon
he
read
away
at
a
fat
life
of
alexander
hamilton
the
liberry
teacher
looked
up
without
stopping
her
story
and
smiled
a
familiar
greeting
to
the
elderly
gentleman
who
was
waiting
a
little
uncertainly
at
the
children
room
door
and
had
obviously
been
looking
for
her
in
vain
he
smiled
and
nodded
in
return
just
a
minute
please
de
guenther
said
the
liberry
teacher
cheerfully
the
elderly
gentleman
nodded
again
crossed
to
isaac
and
his
ponderous
volumes
and
began
to
talk
to
him
with
that
benign
lack
of
haste
which
usually
means
a
very
competent
personality
phyllis
hurried
somewhat
with
robin
hood
among
his
little
fishes
and
felt
happier
it
was
always
in
her
eventless
life
something
of
a
pleasant
adventure
to
have
de
guenther
or
his
wife
drop
in
to
see
her
there
was
usually
something
pleasant
at
the
end
of
it
they
were
an
elderly
couple
whom
she
had
known
for
some
years
they
were
so
leisurely
and
trim
and
that
long
ago
when
she
was
only
a
timorous
substitute
behind
the
circle
of
the
big
she
had
picked
them
both
out
as
then
she
had
waited
on
them
and
identified
them
by
their
cards
as
belonging
to
the
same
family
then
one
day
with
a
pleased
little
quiver
of
joy
she
had
found
him
in
the
city
who
who
age
profession
he
was
a
corporation
lawyer
middle
names
favorite
recreation
and
all
gradually
she
had
come
to
know
them
both
very
well
in
a
way
she
often
chose
that
ended
happily
and
had
colored
illustrations
for
de
guenther
when
she
was
at
home
having
rheumatism
she
had
saved
more
detective
stories
for
de
guenther
than
her
superiors
ever
knew
and
once
she
had
found
his
where
he
had
left
them
between
the
pages
of
the
volume
of
the
encyclopedia
and
mailed
them
to
him
when
she
had
vanished
temporarily
from
sight
into
the
of
the
cataloguing
room
the
de
guenthers
had
still
remembered
her
twice
she
had
been
asked
to
sunday
dinner
at
their
house
and
had
joyously
gone
and
remembered
it
as
joyously
for
months
afterward
now
that
she
was
out
in
the
light
of
partial
day
again
in
the
children
room
she
ran
across
both
of
them
every
little
while
in
her
errands
upstairs
and
once
de
guenther
gentle
lorgnetted
and
had
been
shown
over
the
children
room
the
couple
lived
all
alone
in
a
great
handsome
old
house
that
was
being
crowded
now
by
the
business
district
she
had
always
thought
that
if
she
were
a
theosophist
she
would
try
to
plan
to
have
them
for
an
uncle
and
aunt
in
her
next
incarnation
they
suited
her
exactly
for
the
parts
but
it
a
long
way
down
to
the
basement
where
city
libraries
are
apt
to
keep
their
children
and
the
de
guenthers
had
been
down
there
since
the
last
time
they
asked
her
to
dinner
and
here
with
every
sign
of
having
come
to
say
something
special
stood
de
guenther
phyllis
irrepressibly
cheerful
disposition
gave
a
little
jump
toward
the
light
but
she
went
on
with
her
story
business
before
pleasure
however
she
did
manage
to
get
robin
hood
out
of
his
brook
a
little
more
quickly
than
she
had
planned
she
scattered
her
children
with
a
swift
executive
whisk
and
made
so
straight
for
her
friend
that
she
deceived
the
children
into
thinking
they
were
going
to
see
him
expelled
and
they
banked
up
and
watched
with
anticipatory
grins
i
do
hope
you
want
to
see
me
especially
she
said
brightly
the
children
disappointed
relaxed
their
attention
de
guenther
rose
slowly
and
neatly
from
his
seat
beside
the
rather
bored
isaac
rabinowitz
who
dived
into
his
book
again
with
alacrity
good
afternoon
miss
braithwaite
he
said
in
the
amiably
precise
voice
which
matched
so
admirably
his
beautifully
precise
movements
and
his
immaculate
gray
spats
yes
in
the
language
of
our
young
friend
here
am
the
guy
phyllis
giggled
before
she
thought
some
people
in
the
world
always
make
your
spirits
go
up
with
a
bound
and
the
de
guenther
pair
invariably
had
that
effect
on
her
oh
de
guenther
she
said
i
am
shocked
at
you
that
slang
it
was
more
in
the
nature
of
a
quotation
said
he
apologetically
and
how
are
you
this
exceedingly
unpleasant
day
miss
braithwaite
we
have
seen
very
little
of
you
lately
de
guenther
and
i
the
liberry
teacher
gracefully
respectful
in
her
place
wriggled
with
invisible
impatience
over
this
carefully
polite
conversational
opening
he
had
come
down
here
on
purpose
to
see
her
there
must
be
something
going
to
happen
even
if
it
was
only
a
request
to
save
a
book
for
de
guenther
nobody
ever
wanted
any
kind
of
a
something
to
happen
more
wildly
than
the
liberry
teacher
did
that
bored
stickily
wet
saturday
afternoon
with
those
tired
seven
years
at
the
greenway
branch
dragging
at
the
back
of
her
neck
and
the
seven
times
seven
to
come
making
her
want
to
scream
so
few
things
can
possibly
happen
to
you
no
matter
how
good
you
are
when
you
work
by
the
day
and
now
maybe
something
oh
please
the
very
smallest
kind
of
a
something
would
be
welcomed
was
going
to
occur
maybe
de
guenther
had
sent
her
a
ticket
to
a
concert
she
had
once
before
or
maybe
since
you
might
as
well
wish
for
big
things
while
you
at
it
it
might
even
be
a
ticket
to
an
expensive
seat
in
a
real
theatre
her
blue
eyes
burned
luminous
at
the
idea
but
i
really
should
wish
she
reminded
her
prancing
mind
belatedly
he
may
only
have
come
down
to
talk
about
the
weather
it
may
any
of
it
be
true
so
she
stood
up
straight
and
gravely
and
answered
very
courteously
and
all
the
amiable
roundabout
remarks
the
old
gentleman
was
shoving
forward
like
pawns
on
a
chessboard
before
the
real
game
begins
she
answered
with
the
same
trained
cheerfulness
she
could
give
her
library
children
when
her
head
and
her
disposition
ached
worst
and
even
warmed
to
a
vicious
enthusiasm
over
the
state
of
the
streets
and
the
wetness
of
the
damp
weather
he
knows
lots
of
real
things
to
say
she
complained
to
herself
why
does
he
say
them
instead
of
talking
editorials
i
suppose
this
is
his
bedside
no
lawyers
do
have
bedside
manners
well
his
barside
manner
then
it
is
difficult
to
think
and
listen
at
the
same
time
by
this
time
she
had
missed
a
beautiful
long
paragraph
about
the
department
and
something
else
apparently
for
her
friend
was
holding
out
to
her
a
note
addressed
to
her
flowingly
in
his
wife
english
hand
and
was
saying
which
she
has
asked
me
to
deliver
i
trust
you
have
no
imperative
engagement
for
night
something
happened
why
no
said
the
liberry
teacher
delightedly
no
indeed
thank
you
and
her
too
i
love
to
come
teacher
clamored
a
small
citizen
in
a
kewpie
muffler
my
maw
she
want
a
book
call
she
say
it
got
a
yellow
cover
an
pictures
in
it
just
a
moment
said
phyllis
and
sent
him
upstairs
with
a
note
asking
for
hugh
wynne
in
the
edition
she
was
used
to
translating
that
small
colored
boy
demands
last
week
he
had
described
to
her
a
play
he
called
eas
limb
with
the
final
comment
but
it
wa
no
good
no
limb
in
it
anywhar
ner
no
trees
atall
do
you
have
much
of
that
de
guenther
asked
idly
lots
said
phyllis
cheerfully
you
take
special
training
in
guesswork
at
library
school
they
call
them
they
say
they
good
for
your
intellect
ah
yes
said
de
guenther
absently
in
the
barside
manner
and
then
sitting
calmly
with
his
silvery
head
against
a
birthday
poster
so
that
three
scarlet
cherries
stuck
above
him
in
the
manner
of
a
he
said
something
else
remarkably
real
i
have
we
have
a
little
matter
of
business
to
discuss
with
you
night
my
dear
an
offer
i
may
say
of
a
different
line
of
work
and
i
want
you
to
satisfy
yourself
thoroughly
thoroughly
my
dear
child
of
my
reputableness
johnstone
the
chief
of
the
city
library
whose
office
i
believe
to
be
in
this
branch
is
one
of
my
oldest
friends
i
am
i
think
i
may
say
well
known
as
a
lawyer
in
this
my
native
city
i
should
be
glad
to
have
you
satisfy
yourself
personally
on
these
points
because
could
it
be
that
the
eminently
poised
de
guenther
was
embarrassed
because
the
line
of
work
which
i
wish
or
rather
my
wife
wishes
to
lay
before
you
is
is
a
very
different
line
of
work
ended
the
old
gentleman
inconclusively
there
was
no
mistake
about
it
this
time
he
embarrassed
oh
de
guenther
cried
phyllis
before
she
thought
out
of
the
fulness
of
her
heart
catching
his
arm
in
her
eagerness
oh
de
guenther
the
very
different
line
of
work
have
a
have
a
attached
to
it
anywhere
before
she
was
fairly
finished
she
knew
what
a
silly
question
she
had
asked
how
could
any
line
of
work
she
was
qualified
to
do
possibly
have
attached
to
it
you
ca
catalogue
roses
on
neat
cards
or
improve
their
minds
by
the
newark
ladder
system
or
do
anything
at
all
librarious
to
them
except
pressing
them
in
books
to
mummify
and
the
liberry
teacher
did
think
that
was
at
all
a
courteous
thing
to
do
to
roses
so
de
guenther
reply
quite
surprised
her
there
seems
to
be
no
good
reason
he
said
slowly
and
placidly
as
if
he
were
dropping
his
words
one
by
one
out
of
a
slot
why
there
should
not
be
a
very
satisfactory
or
even
connected
with
it
none
whatever
that
was
all
the
explanation
he
offered
but
the
liberry
teacher
asked
no
more
she
said
rapturously
then
we
may
expect
you
at
seven
he
said
and
smiled
politely
and
moved
to
the
door
he
walked
out
as
as
if
he
had
dropped
in
to
ask
the
meaning
of
circumflex
or
who
invented
smallpox
or
the
name
of
adam
or
how
long
it
would
take
her
to
do
a
graduation
essay
for
his
daughter
or
any
such
little
things
that
librarians
are
prepared
for
most
days
and
instead
his
neat
gray
elderly
back
seemed
to
deny
it
he
had
left
with
her
the
liberry
teacher
her
dusty
tousled
shopworn
phyllis
braithwaite
an
invitation
to
consider
a
line
of
work
which
was
so
mysteriously
different
that
she
had
to
look
up
the
spotless
de
guenther
reputation
before
she
came
one
loses
track
of
time
staring
at
a
red
george
washington
poster
and
wondering
about
a
future
with
a
sudden
different
line
in
it
it
was
ten
minutes
past
time
she
stared
aghast
at
the
ruthless
clock
then
created
two
monitors
for
putting
out
at
one
royal
sweep
she
managed
the
nightly
eviction
with
such
gay
expedition
that
it
almost
felt
like
ten
minutes
ago
when
the
place
except
for
the
monitors
was
cleared
while
these
officers
watched
the
commonalty
clumping
reluctantly
upstairs
toward
the
the
liberry
teacher
paced
sedately
around
the
shelves
giving
the
books
that
routine
straightening
they
must
have
before
seven
struck
and
the
horde
rushed
in
again
it
was
really
her
relieving
officer
work
but
the
liberry
teacher
felt
that
her
mind
needed
straightening
too
and
this
always
seemed
to
do
it
she
looked
as
she
moved
slowly
down
along
the
shelves
very
much
like
most
of
the
librarians
you
see
alert
pleasant
slender
a
little
dishevelled
a
little
worn
but
there
was
really
no
librarian
there
there
was
only
phyllis
narcissa
that
dreaming
young
phyllis
who
had
had
to
stay
pushed
out
of
sight
all
the
seven
years
that
miss
braithwaite
had
been
efficiently
earning
her
living
she
let
her
mind
stray
happily
as
far
as
it
would
over
the
possibilities
de
guenther
had
held
out
to
her
and
woke
to
discover
herself
trying
to
find
a
place
under
domestic
economy
condiments
for
five
little
peppers
and
how
they
grew
she
laughed
aloud
in
the
suddenly
empty
room
and
then
lifted
her
head
to
find
miss
black
the
girl
that
week
standing
in
the
doorway
ready
to
relieve
guard
oh
anna
see
what
i
done
she
laughed
somehow
everything
seemed
merely
and
laughable
since
de
guenther
most
visit
with
its
wild
hints
of
lines
of
work
anna
black
came
looked
laughed
in
the
she
said
well
you
liable
to
do
nearly
everything
by
the
time
it
saturday
last
saturday
dolly
graham
up
in
the
circulation
was
telling
me
an
old
colored
mammy
said
she
lost
her
mittens
in
the
and
the
first
they
knew
dolly
was
hunting
through
the
woollen
goods
classification
and
mary
gayley
pawing
the
dictionary
wildly
for
and
they
found
the
mittens
hung
around
her
neck
by
the
cord
finished
the
liberry
teacher
i
know
it
was
a
thrilling
story
well
till
monday
anna
black
i
going
home
now
to
have
some
lovely
prunes
and
some
real
dried
beef
and
maybe
a
glass
of
if
i
can
persuade
the
landlady
i
need
it
mine
prefers
dried
apricots
responded
miss
black
cheerfully
but
she
never
has
anything
but
canned
milk
in
the
house
thus
sparing
us
the
embarrassment
of
asking
for
real
good
luck
but
as
the
liberry
teacher
pinned
her
serviceable
hat
close
and
fastened
her
still
good
raincoat
over
her
elderly
sweater
neither
prunes
nor
mittens
nor
next
week
work
worried
her
at
all
after
all
living
among
the
with
the
little
people
makes
that
pleasant
land
where
wanting
is
having
and
all
the
impossibilities
can
come
true
very
easy
of
access
phyllis
braithwaite
mind
as
she
picked
her
way
down
the
bedraggled
street
wandered
innocently
off
in
a
full
of
roses
till
the
muddy
marble
steps
of
her
gleamed
sloppily
before
her
through
the
foggy
rain
she
sat
up
late
that
night
doing
improving
things
to
the
white
net
waist
that
went
with
her
best
suit
which
was
black
as
her
needle
nibbled
busily
down
the
seams
she
continued
happily
to
wonder
about
that
entirely
different
line
it
sounded
to
her
more
like
a
reportership
on
a
yellow
journal
than
anything
else
imaginable
or
perhaps
could
she
be
wanted
to
join
the
secret
service
at
any
rate
she
concluded
as
she
stitched
the
last
clean
ruching
into
the
last
sedate
sleeve
at
any
rate
i
have
a
chance
to
wear
mother
gold
earrings
that
i
must
have
on
in
the
library
and
oh
how
lovely
it
will
be
to
have
a
dinner
that
was
cooked
by
a
poor
old
bored
cook
or
a
shiny
tiled
syndicate
and
she
went
to
bed
to
dream
of
entirely
different
lines
all
the
colors
of
the
rainbow
that
radiated
out
from
the
circulation
desk
like
she
never
remembered
eva
atkinson
carefully
prettied
face
or
her
own
vivid
one
at
all
she
only
dreamed
that
far
at
the
end
of
the
pink
entirely
different
line
a
very
hard
one
to
walk
there
was
a
exactly
like
a
patchwork
quilt
where
she
was
to
be
iii
when
phyllis
woke
next
morning
everything
in
the
world
had
a
holiday
feeling
her
sundays
gloriously
unoccupied
generally
did
but
this
was
the
rain
had
managed
to
clear
away
every
vestige
of
last
week
slush
and
had
then
itself
most
unselfishly
retired
down
the
gutters
the
sun
shone
as
if
may
had
come
and
the
wind
through
the
liberry
teacher
window
had
a
springy
feel
to
it
she
found
that
she
had
slept
too
late
to
go
to
church
and
prepared
for
a
joyful
dash
to
the
bathtub
there
might
be
who
knew
but
there
actually
might
be
on
this
day
of
days
enough
hot
water
for
a
real
bath
i
feel
as
if
everything
was
going
to
be
lovely
all
day
she
said
without
preface
to
old
black
maggie
who
was
clumping
her
accustomed
way
along
the
halls
with
her
woolly
head
tied
up
in
her
sunday
silk
handkerchief
even
she
looked
happier
phyllis
thought
than
she
had
yesterday
she
grinned
broadly
at
phyllis
leaning
smilingly
against
the
door
in
her
kimona
ah
dunno
miss
braithways
she
said
and
entered
the
room
and
took
a
in
her
mouth
ah
never
has
dem
premeditations
phyllis
laughed
frankly
and
maggie
much
flattered
at
the
happy
reception
of
her
reply
grinned
so
widely
that
you
might
almost
have
tied
her
mouth
behind
her
ears
you
sure
is
a
cheerful
person
miss
braithways
said
maggie
and
went
on
making
the
bed
phyllis
fled
on
down
the
hall
laughing
still
she
had
just
remembered
another
of
old
maggie
compliments
made
on
one
of
the
rare
occasions
when
phyllis
had
sat
down
and
sung
to
the
piano
she
had
been
able
to
do
it
long
because
the
mental
science
lady
on
the
next
floor
had
sent
down
word
that
it
stopped
her
from
concentrating
and
as
she
had
a
very
expensive
room
there
was
nothing
for
the
landlady
to
do
but
make
phyllis
stop
phyllis
had
come
out
in
the
hall
to
find
old
maggie
listening
rapturously
oh
miss
braithways
she
had
murmured
rolling
her
eyes
you
certainly
does
equalize
a
martingale
it
had
been
a
compliment
phyllis
never
forgot
she
smiled
to
herself
as
she
found
the
bathroom
door
open
why
the
world
was
full
of
a
number
of
things
many
of
them
funny
being
a
liberry
teacher
was
rather
nice
after
all
when
you
were
fresh
from
a
long
night
sleep
and
if
that
mental
science
lady
let
her
play
the
piano
why
her
thrilling
tales
of
what
she
could
do
when
her
mind
was
unfettered
were
worth
the
price
that
story
she
told
so
seriously
about
how
the
pipes
burst
and
the
plumber
would
come
and
my
dear
i
gave
those
pipes
only
half
an
hour
treatment
and
they
closed
right
up
it
was
quite
as
much
fun
well
almost
as
much
hearing
her
as
it
would
have
been
to
play
all
of
the
contented
and
otherwise
elderly
people
who
inhabited
the
with
phyllis
appeared
to
have
gone
off
without
using
hot
water
for
there
actually
was
some
the
liberry
teacher
found
that
she
could
have
a
genuine
bath
and
have
enough
water
besides
to
wash
her
hair
which
is
a
rite
all
girls
who
work
have
to
reserve
for
sundays
this
was
surely
a
day
of
days
she
used
the
water
alas
for
selfish
human
nature
to
the
last
warm
drop
and
went
gayly
back
to
her
little
room
with
no
emotions
whatever
for
the
poor
other
boarders
soon
to
find
themselves
wrathfully
and
then
she
thoughtlessly
curled
down
on
the
bed
and
slept
and
slept
and
slept
she
wakened
dimly
in
time
for
the
one
dinner
dressed
and
ate
it
in
a
she
went
back
upstairs
planning
a
that
should
take
her
out
into
the
country
where
a
long
walk
might
be
had
and
midway
in
changing
her
shoes
she
lay
back
across
the
bed
and
fell
asleep
again
the
truth
was
phyllis
was
about
as
tired
as
a
girl
can
get
she
waked
at
dusk
with
a
jerk
of
terror
lest
she
should
have
overslept
her
time
for
going
out
but
it
was
only
six
she
had
a
whole
hour
to
prink
in
which
is
a
very
long
time
for
people
who
are
used
to
being
in
the
library
after
the
wakes
them
some
houses
all
of
themselves
and
before
you
meet
a
soul
who
lives
in
them
are
silently
indifferent
to
you
some
make
you
feel
that
you
are
not
wanted
in
the
least
these
usually
have
a
lot
of
gilt
furniture
and
what
are
called
objects
of
art
set
stiffly
about
some
seem
to
be
having
an
untidy
good
time
all
to
themselves
in
which
you
are
not
included
the
de
guenther
house
staid
and
softly
toned
did
none
of
these
things
it
gave
the
liberry
teacher
in
her
neat
last
year
best
suit
a
feeling
as
of
gentle
she
felt
contented
and
even
before
slender
little
de
guenther
came
rustling
gently
in
to
greet
her
then
followed
de
guenther
pleasant
and
unperturbed
as
usual
and
after
him
an
agreeable
gray
cat
who
had
copied
his
master
walk
as
exactly
as
it
can
be
done
with
four
feet
all
four
sat
amiably
about
the
room
and
held
precise
and
pleasant
converse
something
like
a
cheerful
essay
written
in
dialogue
about
many
amusing
intelligent
things
which
did
especially
matter
the
liberry
teacher
liked
it
it
was
pleasant
beyond
words
to
sit
nestlingly
in
a
pluffy
chair
and
hear
about
all
the
little
scholarly
things
her
father
had
used
to
talk
of
she
carried
on
her
own
small
part
in
the
talk
blithely
enough
she
approved
of
herself
and
the
way
she
was
behaving
which
makes
very
much
for
comfort
there
was
only
once
that
she
was
ashamed
of
herself
and
thought
about
it
in
bed
afterwards
and
was
mortified
when
her
eyes
filled
with
quick
tears
at
a
quite
dry
and
unemotional
indeed
rather
a
sarcastic
quotation
from
horace
on
the
part
of
de
guenther
but
she
smiled
when
she
saw
that
they
noticed
her
that
the
first
time
i
heard
a
latin
quotation
since
i
came
away
from
home
she
found
herself
saying
quite
simply
in
explanation
and
father
quoted
horace
so
much
every
day
that
that
i
felt
as
if
an
old
friend
had
walked
in
but
her
hosts
did
seem
to
mind
de
guenther
in
his
careful
evening
clothes
looked
swiftly
across
at
de
guenther
in
her
and
they
both
nodded
little
satisfied
nods
as
if
she
had
spoken
in
a
way
that
they
were
glad
to
hear
and
then
dinner
was
served
a
dinner
as
different
well
she
did
want
to
remember
in
its
presence
the
dinners
it
differed
from
they
might
have
clouded
the
moment
she
merely
ate
it
with
a
shameless
inward
joy
it
ended
still
to
a
pleasant
effortless
accompaniment
of
talk
about
books
and
music
and
pictures
that
phyllis
was
interested
in
and
had
found
nobody
to
share
her
interest
with
for
so
long
so
long
she
felt
happily
running
though
everything
the
general
easy
of
all
the
old
gentle
inflexible
standards
of
breeding
that
she
had
nearly
forgotten
down
in
the
heart
of
the
city
among
her
obstreperous
affectionate
little
foreigners
they
had
coffee
in
the
long
salon
parlor
and
then
de
guenther
straightened
himself
and
de
guenther
folded
her
veined
ringed
old
white
hands
and
phyllis
prepared
thrilledly
to
listen
surely
now
she
would
hear
about
that
different
line
of
work
there
was
nothing
at
first
about
work
of
any
sort
they
merely
began
to
tell
her
alternately
about
some
clients
of
theirs
a
harrington
and
her
son
rather
interesting
people
from
what
phyllis
could
make
out
she
wondered
if
she
was
going
to
hear
that
they
needed
a
librarian
this
lady
my
client
harrington
continued
her
host
gravely
is
the
one
for
whom
i
may
ask
you
to
consider
doing
some
work
i
say
may
but
it
is
a
practical
certainty
she
is
absolutely
alone
my
dear
miss
braithwaite
except
for
her
son
i
am
afraid
i
must
ask
you
to
listen
to
a
long
story
about
them
it
was
coming
oh
but
i
want
to
hear
said
phyllis
with
that
quick
affectionate
sympathy
of
hers
that
was
so
winning
leaning
forward
and
watching
them
with
the
lighted
look
in
her
blue
eyes
it
all
seemed
to
her
tired
alert
mind
like
some
story
she
might
have
read
to
her
children
an
arabian
nights
narrative
which
might
begin
and
the
master
of
the
house
ascribing
praise
unto
allah
repeated
the
following
tale
there
have
always
been
just
the
two
of
them
mother
and
son
said
the
master
of
the
house
and
allan
has
always
been
a
very
great
deal
to
his
mother
poor
angela
murmured
his
wife
they
are
old
friends
of
ours
her
husband
explained
my
wife
and
harrington
were
schoolmates
well
allan
the
boy
grew
up
dowered
with
everything
a
mother
could
possibly
desire
for
her
son
personally
and
otherwise
he
was
handsome
and
intelligent
with
much
charm
of
manner
i
know
now
what
people
mean
by
like
a
book
thought
phyllis
irreverently
and
i
do
believe
any
one
man
be
all
that
there
was
practically
nothing
de
guenther
went
on
which
the
poor
lad
had
not
that
was
one
trouble
i
imagine
if
he
had
not
been
highly
intelligent
he
would
not
have
studied
so
hard
if
he
had
not
been
strong
and
active
he
might
not
have
taken
up
athletic
sports
so
and
when
i
add
that
allan
possessed
charm
money
and
social
status
you
may
see
that
what
he
did
would
have
broken
down
most
young
fellows
in
short
he
kept
studies
sports
and
social
affairs
all
going
at
high
pressure
during
his
four
years
of
college
but
he
was
young
and
strong
and
might
not
have
felt
so
much
ill
effects
from
all
that
though
his
doctors
said
afterwards
that
he
was
nearly
at
the
breaking
point
when
he
graduated
phyllis
bent
closer
to
the
in
her
intense
interest
why
it
like
one
of
her
she
held
her
breath
to
listen
while
the
old
lawyer
went
gravely
on
allan
could
not
have
been
more
than
when
he
graduated
and
it
was
a
very
short
while
afterwards
that
he
became
engaged
to
a
young
girl
the
daughter
of
a
family
friend
louise
frey
was
her
name
was
it
not
love
yes
that
is
right
said
his
wife
louise
frey
a
beautiful
girl
he
went
on
dark
with
a
brilliant
color
and
full
of
life
and
good
spirits
they
were
both
very
young
but
there
was
no
good
reason
why
the
marriage
should
be
delayed
and
it
was
set
for
the
following
september
a
princess
too
in
the
story
but
where
had
she
gone
the
two
of
them
only
he
had
said
it
must
have
been
scarcely
a
month
the
story
went
on
de
guenther
was
telling
it
as
if
he
were
stating
a
case
nearly
a
month
before
the
date
set
for
the
wedding
when
the
lovers
went
for
a
long
automobile
ride
across
a
range
of
mountains
near
a
where
they
were
both
staying
they
were
alone
in
the
machine
allan
of
course
was
driving
doubtless
with
a
certain
degree
of
impetuosity
as
he
did
most
things
they
were
on
an
unfrequented
part
of
the
road
said
de
guenther
lowering
his
voice
when
there
occurred
an
unforeseen
wreckage
in
the
car
machinery
the
car
was
thrown
over
and
badly
splintered
both
young
people
were
pinned
under
it
so
far
as
he
knew
at
the
time
allan
was
not
injured
nor
was
he
in
any
pain
but
he
was
held
in
absolute
inability
to
move
by
the
car
above
him
miss
frey
on
the
contrary
was
badly
hurt
and
in
suffering
she
died
in
about
three
hours
a
little
before
relief
came
to
them
phyllis
clutched
the
arms
of
her
chair
thrilled
and
she
could
imagine
all
the
horror
of
the
happening
through
the
old
precise
and
unemotional
story
the
pinioned
helpless
condemned
to
watch
his
sweetheart
dying
by
inches
and
unable
to
help
her
by
so
much
as
lifting
a
hand
could
anything
be
more
awful
not
only
to
endure
but
to
remember
and
yet
she
thought
whimsically
it
might
be
so
bad
to
have
one
tragedy
to
remember
if
you
have
anything
else
all
have
to
remember
when
i
old
will
be
bad
little
children
and
good
little
children
and
books
and
and
the
recollection
that
people
said
i
was
a
very
worthy
young
woman
once
but
she
threw
off
the
thought
it
just
as
well
not
to
think
of
old
age
when
all
the
idea
brings
up
is
a
vision
of
a
nice
clean
old
ladies
home
but
you
said
he
was
an
invalid
she
said
aloud
yes
i
regret
to
say
answered
de
guenther
you
see
it
was
found
that
the
shock
to
the
nerves
acting
on
an
already
mind
and
body
together
with
some
spinal
blow
concerning
which
the
doctors
are
still
in
doubt
had
affected
allan
powers
of
locomotion
de
guenther
certainly
did
like
long
words
he
has
been
unable
to
walk
since
and
which
is
sadder
his
state
of
mind
and
body
has
become
steadily
worse
he
can
scarcely
move
at
all
now
and
his
mental
attitude
can
only
be
described
as
painfully
morbid
yes
i
may
say
painfully
morbid
sometimes
he
does
not
speak
at
all
for
days
together
even
to
his
mother
or
his
attendant
oh
poor
boy
said
phyllis
how
long
has
he
been
this
way
seven
years
this
fall
the
answer
came
consideringly
is
it
not
love
yes
said
his
wife
seven
years
said
the
liberry
teacher
with
a
quick
catch
of
sympathy
at
her
heart
just
as
long
as
she
had
been
working
for
her
living
in
the
big
dusty
library
supposing
oh
supposing
she
had
to
live
all
that
time
in
such
suffering
as
this
poor
allan
had
endured
and
his
mother
had
had
to
witness
she
felt
suddenly
as
if
the
grimy
restless
children
room
with
its
clatter
of
turbulent
little
outland
voices
were
a
safe
sunny
paradise
in
comparison
de
guenther
did
not
speak
he
visibly
braced
himself
and
was
visibly
i
have
told
most
of
the
story
isabel
love
said
he
at
last
would
you
not
prefer
to
tell
the
rest
it
is
at
your
instance
that
i
have
undertaken
this
commission
for
harrington
you
will
remember
it
struck
phyllis
that
he
did
think
it
was
quite
a
dignified
commission
at
that
very
well
my
dear
said
his
wife
and
took
up
the
tale
in
her
swift
soft
voice
you
can
fancy
my
dear
miss
braithwaite
how
intensely
his
mother
has
felt
about
it
indeed
yes
said
phyllis
pitifully
her
whole
life
since
the
accident
has
been
one
long
devotion
to
her
son
i
do
think
a
ever
passes
that
she
does
not
see
him
but
in
spite
of
this
constant
care
as
my
husband
has
told
you
he
grows
steadily
worse
and
poor
angela
has
finally
broken
under
the
strain
she
was
never
strong
she
is
dying
now
they
give
her
maybe
two
months
more
her
one
anxiety
of
course
is
for
poor
allan
welfare
you
can
imagine
how
you
would
feel
if
you
had
to
leave
an
entirely
helpless
son
or
brother
to
the
mercies
of
hired
attendants
however
faithful
and
they
have
no
relatives
they
are
the
last
of
the
family
the
listening
girl
began
to
see
she
was
going
to
be
asked
to
act
as
nurse
perhaps
attendant
and
guardian
to
this
morbid
invalid
with
the
injured
mind
and
body
illustration
no
said
de
guenther
gravely
you
would
not
you
would
have
to
be
his
wife
but
how
would
i
be
any
better
for
him
than
a
regular
trained
nurse
she
wondered
and
they
said
he
had
an
attendant
she
looked
questioningly
at
the
pair
where
does
my
part
come
in
she
asked
with
a
certain
sweet
directness
which
was
sometimes
hers
would
i
be
a
hireling
too
if
if
i
had
anything
to
do
with
it
no
said
de
guenther
gravely
you
would
not
you
would
have
to
be
his
wife
iv
the
liberry
teacher
in
her
sober
best
suit
sat
down
in
her
entirely
commonplace
chair
in
the
quiet
old
parlor
and
looked
unbelievingly
at
the
sedate
elderly
couple
who
had
made
her
this
wild
proposition
she
caught
her
breath
but
catching
her
breath
did
not
seem
to
affect
anything
that
had
been
said
de
guenther
took
up
the
explanation
again
a
little
deprecatingly
she
thought
you
see
now
why
i
requested
you
to
investigate
our
reputability
he
said
such
a
proposition
as
this
especially
to
a
young
lady
who
has
no
parent
or
guardian
requires
a
considerable
guarantee
of
good
faith
and
honesty
of
motive
will
you
please
tell
me
more
about
it
she
asked
quietly
she
did
not
feel
now
as
if
it
were
anything
which
had
especially
to
do
with
her
it
seemed
more
like
an
interesting
story
she
was
unravelling
sentence
by
sentence
the
long
softly
lighted
old
room
with
its
stuarts
and
sullys
and
its
gracious
host
and
hostess
seemed
only
a
picturesque
part
of
it
her
hostess
caught
up
the
tale
again
angela
has
been
nearly
distracted
she
said
and
the
idea
has
come
to
her
that
if
she
could
find
some
conscientious
woman
a
lady
and
a
person
to
whom
what
she
could
offer
would
be
a
consideration
who
would
take
charge
of
poor
allan
that
she
could
die
in
peace
but
why
did
you
think
of
asking
me
the
girl
asked
breathlessly
and
why
does
she
want
me
married
to
him
and
how
could
you
or
she
be
sure
that
i
would
not
be
as
much
of
a
hireling
as
any
nurse
she
may
have
now
de
guenther
answered
the
last
two
questions
together
harrington
idea
is
and
i
think
rightly
that
a
conscientious
woman
would
feel
the
marriage
tie
however
nominal
a
bond
that
would
obligate
her
to
a
certain
duty
toward
her
husband
as
to
why
we
selected
you
my
dear
my
husband
and
i
have
had
an
interest
in
you
for
some
years
as
you
know
we
have
spoken
of
you
as
a
girl
whom
we
should
like
for
a
relative
why
is
that
strange
cried
phyllis
dimpling
that
just
what
i
thought
about
you
de
guenther
flushed
with
a
delicate
old
shyness
thank
you
dear
child
she
said
i
was
about
to
add
that
we
have
not
seen
you
at
your
work
all
these
years
without
knowing
you
to
have
the
kind
heart
and
sense
of
honor
requisite
to
poor
angela
plan
we
feel
sure
you
could
be
trusted
to
take
the
place
de
guenther
has
asked
his
friend
johnston
the
head
of
the
library
such
things
as
we
needed
to
supplement
our
personal
knowledge
of
you
you
have
everything
that
could
be
asked
even
to
a
certain
cheerfulness
of
outlook
which
poor
angela
naturally
lacks
in
a
measure
but
but
what
about
asked
phyllis
braithwaite
a
little
piteously
in
answer
to
all
this
they
seemed
so
certain
she
was
what
they
wanted
was
there
anything
in
this
wild
scheme
that
would
make
life
better
than
it
was
as
the
tired
keeper
of
a
roomful
of
turbulent
little
foreigners
unless
you
are
thinking
of
marriage
phyllis
shook
her
head
you
would
have
at
least
a
much
easier
life
than
you
have
now
harrington
would
settle
a
liberal
income
on
you
contingent
of
course
of
your
faithful
wardership
over
allan
we
would
be
your
only
judges
as
to
that
you
would
have
a
couple
or
more
months
of
absolute
freedom
every
year
control
of
much
of
your
own
time
ample
leisure
to
enjoy
it
you
would
give
only
your
chances
of
actual
marriage
for
perhaps
five
years
for
poor
allan
can
not
live
longer
than
that
at
his
present
state
of
retrogression
and
some
part
of
every
day
to
seeing
that
allan
was
not
neglected
if
you
bestow
on
him
half
of
the
interest
and
effort
i
have
known
of
your
giving
any
one
of
a
dozen
little
immigrant
boys
his
mother
has
nothing
to
fear
for
him
de
guenther
stopped
with
a
grave
little
bow
and
he
and
his
wife
waited
for
the
reply
the
liberry
teacher
sat
silent
her
eyes
on
her
slim
hands
that
were
roughened
and
reddened
by
constant
hurried
washings
to
get
off
the
dirt
of
the
library
books
it
was
true
a
good
deal
of
it
anyhow
and
one
thing
they
had
not
said
was
true
also
her
sunniness
and
accuracy
and
strength
her
were
wearing
thin
under
the
pressure
of
too
long
hours
and
too
hard
work
and
too
few
personal
interests
her
youth
was
worn
down
and
marriage
what
chance
of
love
and
marriage
had
she
a
alone
too
poor
to
see
anything
of
the
class
of
men
she
would
be
willing
to
marry
she
had
not
for
years
spent
six
hours
with
a
man
of
her
own
kind
and
age
she
had
not
even
been
specially
in
love
that
she
could
remember
since
she
was
grown
up
she
did
not
feel
much
now
as
if
she
ever
would
be
all
that
she
had
to
give
up
in
taking
this
offer
was
her
freedom
such
as
it
was
and
those
fluttering
perhapses
that
whisper
such
pleasant
promises
when
you
are
young
but
then
she
would
be
young
so
much
longer
should
she
she
put
it
to
herself
crudely
should
she
wait
long
hard
years
in
the
faith
that
she
would
learn
to
be
absolutely
contented
or
that
some
man
she
could
love
would
come
to
the
cheap
or
the
little
church
she
attended
occasionally
when
she
was
not
too
tired
fall
in
love
with
her
looks
at
sight
and
marry
her
it
had
not
happened
all
these
years
while
her
girlhood
had
been
more
attractive
and
her
personality
more
untired
there
was
scarcely
a
chance
in
a
hundred
for
her
of
a
kind
and
such
dear
children
as
she
had
seen
eva
atkinson
convoying
well
her
mind
suddenly
came
up
against
the
remembrance
as
against
a
sober
fact
that
in
her
passionate
wishings
of
yesterday
she
had
not
wished
for
a
nor
for
children
she
had
asked
for
a
husband
who
would
give
her
money
and
leisure
to
be
rested
and
pretty
and
a
and
here
apparently
was
her
wish
uncannily
fulfilled
well
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
inquired
the
destinies
with
their
traditional
indifference
we
ca
wait
all
night
she
lifted
her
head
and
cast
an
almost
frightened
look
at
the
de
guenthers
waiting
courteously
for
her
decision
in
reply
to
the
look
de
guenther
began
giving
her
details
about
the
money
and
the
leisure
time
and
the
business
terms
of
the
contract
generally
she
listened
attentively
all
that
for
a
little
guardianship
a
little
kindness
and
the
of
a
little
piece
of
life
nobody
wanted
and
a
few
little
hopes
and
dreams
phyllis
laughed
as
she
always
did
when
there
were
big
black
problems
to
be
solved
after
all
it
fairly
usual
she
said
i
heard
last
week
of
a
woman
who
left
money
along
with
her
pet
dog
very
much
the
same
way
did
you
did
you
dear
asked
de
guenther
beaming
then
you
think
you
will
do
it
the
liberry
teacher
rose
and
squared
her
straight
young
shoulders
under
the
worn
net
waist
if
harrington
thinks
i
do
for
the
situation
she
said
gallantly
and
laughed
again
it
feels
partly
like
going
into
a
nunnery
and
partly
like
going
into
a
she
said
to
herself
that
night
as
she
wound
her
alarm
but
i
wonder
if
anybody
remembered
to
ask
the
consent
of
the
groom
v
he
looked
like
a
young
crusader
on
a
tomb
that
was
phyllis
first
impression
of
allan
harrington
he
talked
and
acted
if
a
moveless
man
can
be
said
to
act
like
a
bored
spoiled
small
boy
that
was
her
second
harrington
fragile
flushed
breathlessly
intense
in
her
had
yet
a
certain
resemblance
in
voice
and
gesture
to
de
guenther
a
resemblance
which
puzzled
phyllis
till
she
placed
it
as
the
mark
of
that
ladies
school
they
had
attended
together
there
was
also
a
graceful
mincing
white
wolfhound
which
contrary
to
the
accepted
notion
of
invalids
faithful
hounds
did
seem
to
care
for
his
master
darkened
at
all
but
followed
the
one
sunny
spot
in
harrington
room
with
a
wistful
persistence
it
was
such
a
small
spot
for
such
a
long
wolfhound
that
was
the
principal
thing
which
impressed
itself
on
phyllis
frightened
mind
throughout
her
visit
de
guenther
convoyed
her
to
the
harrington
house
for
inspection
a
couple
of
days
after
she
had
accepted
some
one
proposal
to
marry
allan
harrington
whether
it
counted
as
her
future
proposal
or
her
future
trustee
she
was
never
sure
the
only
sure
thing
was
that
it
did
not
come
from
the
groom
she
had
borrowed
a
from
the
future
on
purpose
though
she
did
not
want
to
go
at
all
but
the
reality
was
not
bad
only
a
fluttering
emotional
little
woman
who
clung
to
her
hands
and
talked
to
her
and
asked
useless
questions
with
a
nervous
insistence
which
would
have
been
for
a
steady
thing
but
was
only
pitiful
to
a
stranger
you
see
strange
people
all
the
time
in
library
work
and
learn
to
place
them
at
length
with
almost
as
much
accuracy
as
you
do
your
books
the
fact
that
harrington
was
not
long
for
this
world
did
not
prevent
phyllis
from
classing
her
in
her
mental
as
a
very
perfect
specimen
of
the
loving
nagger
she
was
lying
back
wrapped
in
something
gray
and
soft
when
her
visitors
came
looking
as
if
the
lifting
of
her
hand
would
be
an
effort
she
was
evidently
pitifully
weak
but
she
had
too
an
ineradicable
vitality
she
could
summon
at
need
she
sprang
almost
upright
to
greet
her
visitors
a
hand
out
to
each
an
eager
flood
of
words
on
her
lips
and
you
are
miss
braithwaite
that
is
going
to
look
after
my
boy
she
ended
oh
it
is
so
good
of
you
i
am
so
glad
i
can
go
in
peace
now
are
you
sure
sure
you
will
know
the
minute
his
attendants
are
the
least
bit
negligent
i
watch
and
watch
them
all
the
time
i
tell
allan
to
ring
for
me
if
anything
ever
is
the
least
bit
wrong
i
am
always
begging
him
to
remember
i
go
in
every
night
and
pray
with
him
do
you
think
you
could
do
that
but
i
always
cry
so
before
i
through
i
cry
and
cry
my
poor
helpless
boy
he
was
so
strong
and
bright
and
you
are
sure
you
are
conscientious
at
this
point
phyllis
stopped
the
flow
of
harrington
conversation
firmly
if
sweetly
yes
indeed
she
said
cheerfully
but
you
know
if
i
not
de
guenther
can
stop
all
my
allowance
it
would
be
to
my
own
interest
not
to
fulfil
my
duties
faithfully
yes
that
is
true
said
harrington
that
was
a
good
thought
of
mine
my
husband
always
said
i
was
an
unusual
woman
where
business
was
concerned
so
they
went
on
the
principle
that
she
had
no
honor
beyond
working
for
what
she
would
get
out
of
it
although
she
had
made
the
suggestion
herself
phyllis
cheeks
burned
and
she
was
about
to
answer
sharply
then
somehow
the
poor
anxious
loving
mother
absolute
preoccupation
with
her
son
struck
her
as
right
after
all
if
it
were
my
son
thought
phyllis
i
would
worry
about
any
strange
hired
girl
feelings
either
maybe
i
just
think
about
him
i
promise
i
look
after
harrington
welfare
as
if
he
were
my
own
brother
she
ended
aloud
impulsively
indeed
you
may
trust
me
i
am
sure
you
will
panted
harrington
you
look
like
a
good
girl
and
and
old
enough
to
be
responsible
thirty
not
very
far
from
that
said
phyllis
serenely
and
you
are
sure
you
will
know
when
the
attendants
are
neglectful
i
speak
to
them
all
the
time
but
i
never
can
be
sure
and
now
better
see
poor
allan
this
is
one
of
his
good
days
just
think
dear
isabel
he
spoke
to
me
twice
without
my
speaking
to
him
this
morning
oh
must
i
asked
phyllis
dismayed
could
i
wait
till
till
it
happens
harrington
actually
laughed
a
little
at
her
shyness
lighting
up
like
a
girl
phyllis
felt
dimly
though
she
tried
not
to
that
through
it
all
her
was
taking
pleasure
in
the
dramatic
side
of
the
situation
she
had
engineered
oh
my
dear
you
must
see
him
he
expects
you
she
answered
almost
gayly
the
procession
of
three
moved
down
the
long
room
towards
a
door
phyllis
hand
guiding
the
she
was
surprised
to
find
herself
shaking
with
fright
just
what
she
expected
to
find
beyond
the
door
she
did
not
know
but
it
must
have
been
some
horror
for
it
was
with
a
of
wild
relief
that
she
finally
made
out
allan
harrington
lying
white
in
the
darkened
place
a
crusader
on
a
tomb
yes
he
looked
like
that
in
the
room
the
pallor
of
his
still
face
and
his
long
hands
was
nearly
the
same
as
the
whiteness
of
the
his
hair
and
waving
flung
back
from
his
forehead
like
a
crest
and
his
dark
brows
and
lashes
made
the
only
note
of
darkness
about
him
to
phyllis
eyes
he
seemed
so
perfect
an
image
that
she
could
have
watched
him
for
hours
here
miss
braithwaite
my
poor
darling
said
his
mother
the
young
lady
we
have
been
talking
about
so
long
the
crusader
lifted
his
eyelids
and
let
them
fall
again
is
she
he
said
listlessly
do
you
want
to
talk
to
her
darling
boy
his
mother
persisted
half
out
of
breath
but
still
full
of
that
unrebuffable
loving
energy
and
insistence
which
she
would
probably
keep
to
the
last
minute
of
her
life
no
said
the
crusader
still
in
those
empty
listless
tones
rather
not
talk
i
tired
his
mother
seemed
not
at
all
put
out
of
course
darling
she
said
kissing
him
she
sat
by
him
still
however
and
poured
out
sentence
after
sentence
of
question
insistence
imploration
and
pity
eliciting
no
answer
at
all
phyllis
wondered
how
it
would
feel
to
have
to
lie
still
and
have
that
done
to
you
for
a
term
of
years
the
result
of
her
wonderment
was
a
decision
to
forgive
her
unenthusiastic
future
bridegroom
for
what
she
had
at
first
been
ready
to
slap
him
presently
harrington
breath
flagged
and
the
three
women
went
away
back
to
the
room
they
had
been
in
before
phyllis
sat
and
let
herself
be
talked
to
for
a
little
longer
then
she
rose
impulsively
may
i
go
back
and
see
your
son
again
for
just
a
minute
she
asked
and
had
gone
before
harrington
had
finished
her
permission
she
darted
into
the
dark
room
before
her
courage
had
time
to
fail
and
stood
by
the
white
couch
again
harrington
she
said
clearly
i
sorry
you
tired
but
afraid
i
am
going
to
have
to
ask
you
to
listen
to
me
you
know
you
that
your
mother
plans
to
have
me
marry
you
for
a
sort
of
interested
are
you
willing
to
have
it
happen
because
i
wo
do
it
unless
you
really
prefer
it
the
heavy
white
lids
again
i
do
mind
said
allan
harrington
listlessly
i
suppose
you
are
quiet
and
trustworthy
or
de
guenther
would
have
sent
you
it
will
give
mother
a
little
peace
and
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
he
closed
his
eyes
and
the
subject
at
the
same
time
well
then
that
all
right
said
phyllis
cheerfully
and
started
to
go
then
drawn
back
by
a
sudden
nervous
she
moved
back
on
him
and
let
me
tell
you
she
added
that
if
you
ever
get
into
my
quiet
trustworthy
clutches
you
may
have
an
awful
time
you
a
very
spoiled
invalid
she
whisked
out
of
the
room
before
he
could
have
gone
very
far
with
his
reply
but
he
had
not
cared
to
reply
apparently
he
lay
unmoved
and
unmoving
phyllis
discovered
poising
breathless
on
the
threshold
that
somehow
she
had
seen
his
eyes
they
had
been
a
little
like
the
wolfhound
a
sort
of
wistful
for
some
reason
she
found
that
allan
harrington
attitude
of
absolute
detachment
made
the
whole
affair
seem
much
easier
for
her
and
when
harrington
slipped
a
solitaire
diamond
into
her
hand
as
she
went
instead
of
disliking
it
she
enjoyed
its
feel
on
her
finger
and
the
flash
of
it
in
the
light
she
thanked
harrington
for
it
with
real
gratitude
but
it
made
her
feel
more
than
ever
engaged
to
marry
her
she
walked
home
rather
silently
with
de
guenther
only
at
the
foot
of
the
de
guenther
steps
she
made
one
absent
remark
he
must
have
been
delightful
she
said
when
he
was
alive
vi
after
a
week
of
the
old
bustling
dusty
hard
work
the
liberry
visit
to
the
de
guenthers
and
the
subsequent
one
at
the
harringtons
and
even
her
sparkling
white
ring
seemed
part
of
a
queer
story
she
had
finished
and
put
back
on
the
shelf
the
ring
was
the
most
real
thing
because
it
was
something
of
a
worry
she
did
dare
leave
it
at
home
nor
did
she
want
to
wear
it
she
finally
sewed
it
in
a
chamois
bag
that
she
under
her
then
she
dismissed
it
from
her
mind
also
there
is
very
little
time
in
a
liberry
teacher
life
for
meditation
only
once
in
a
while
would
come
to
her
the
vision
of
the
wistful
harrington
wolfhound
following
his
inadequate
patch
of
sunlight
or
of
the
dusky
room
where
allan
harrington
lay
inert
and
white
and
looking
like
a
wonderful
carved
statue
on
a
tomb
she
began
to
do
a
little
to
her
clothes
but
not
very
much
because
she
had
neither
time
nor
money
de
guenther
had
wanted
her
to
take
some
money
in
advance
but
she
had
refused
she
did
not
want
it
till
she
had
earned
it
and
anyway
it
would
have
made
the
whole
thing
so
real
she
knew
that
she
would
have
backed
out
and
it
is
as
if
i
were
going
to
a
lover
she
defended
herself
to
de
guenther
with
a
little
wistful
smile
nobody
will
know
what
i
have
on
any
more
than
they
do
now
de
guenther
gave
a
scandalized
little
cry
her
attitude
was
determinedly
that
it
was
just
an
ordinary
marriage
as
good
an
excuse
for
sentiment
and
pretty
frocks
as
any
other
my
dear
child
she
replied
firmly
you
are
going
to
have
one
pretty
frock
and
one
really
good
or
i
will
know
why
the
rest
you
may
get
yourself
after
the
wedding
but
you
must
obey
me
in
this
nonsense
you
can
get
a
as
you
call
it
perfectly
well
what
albert
in
politics
for
if
he
ca
get
favors
for
his
friends
and
in
effect
it
proved
that
albert
was
in
politics
to
some
purpose
for
orders
came
up
from
the
head
office
within
twenty
minutes
after
de
guenther
had
used
the
telephone
on
her
husband
that
miss
braithwaite
was
to
have
a
immediately
as
far
as
she
could
make
out
in
order
to
transact
city
affairs
she
felt
as
if
the
angels
had
told
her
she
could
have
the
last
fortnight
over
again
as
a
favor
or
something
of
the
sort
a
out
of
turn
was
something
nobody
had
ever
heard
of
she
was
even
too
surprised
to
object
to
the
frock
part
of
the
situation
she
tried
to
stand
out
a
little
longer
but
it
a
very
stoical
young
woman
who
can
refuse
to
have
pretty
clothes
bought
for
her
and
the
end
of
it
was
a
seat
in
a
salon
which
she
had
always
considered
so
expensive
that
you
scarcely
ought
to
look
in
the
window
had
it
better
be
a
black
suit
asked
de
guenther
doubtfully
as
the
tall
lady
in
floppy
charmeuse
hovered
haughtily
about
them
expecting
orders
it
seems
horrible
to
buy
mourning
when
dear
angela
is
not
yet
passed
away
but
it
would
only
be
showing
proper
respect
and
i
remember
my
own
dear
mother
planned
all
our
mourning
outfits
while
she
was
dying
it
was
quite
a
pleasure
to
her
phyllis
kept
her
face
straight
and
slipped
one
persuasive
hand
through
her
friend
arm
i
do
believe
i
buy
mourning
dear
she
said
and
oh
if
you
knew
how
long
i
wanted
a
really
blue
suit
only
it
would
have
been
too
vivid
to
wear
well
i
always
knew
that
because
you
can
only
afford
one
every
other
year
and
phyllis
rather
diffidently
voiced
a
thought
which
had
been
in
the
back
of
her
mind
for
a
long
time
if
i
going
to
be
much
around
harrington
do
you
think
cheerful
clothes
would
be
best
everything
in
that
house
seems
sombre
enough
now
perhaps
you
are
right
dear
child
said
de
guenther
i
hope
you
may
be
the
means
of
putting
a
great
deal
of
brightness
into
poor
life
before
he
joins
his
mother
oh
do
cried
phyllis
impulsively
somehow
she
could
not
bear
to
think
of
allan
harrington
dying
he
was
too
beautiful
to
be
dead
where
nobody
could
see
him
any
more
besides
phyllis
privately
considered
that
a
long
vacation
before
he
joined
his
mother
would
be
only
the
fair
thing
for
poor
allan
youth
sides
with
youth
and
the
white
lines
of
him
rose
in
her
memory
and
stayed
there
she
could
almost
hear
that
poor
tired
toneless
voice
of
his
that
was
yet
so
deep
and
so
perfectly
accented
she
bought
docilely
whatever
her
guide
directed
and
woke
from
a
species
of
gentle
daze
at
the
afternoon
end
to
find
de
guenther
beaming
with
the
weary
rapture
of
the
successful
shopper
and
herself
the
proprietress
of
a
turquoise
velvet
a
hat
to
match
a
pale
blue
evening
frock
a
pale
green
with
lovely
clinging
lines
and
a
heavenly
white
crepe
thing
with
rosy
ribbons
and
filmy
the
negligee
of
one
dreams
there
were
also
slippers
and
shoes
and
stockings
and
this
was
really
too
bad
of
de
guenther
a
set
of
lingerie
straight
through
de
guenther
sat
and
continued
to
beam
joyously
over
the
array
in
phyllis
little
bedroom
it
my
present
dearie
she
said
calmly
so
you
need
worry
about
using
angela
money
gracious
it
been
i
have
had
such
a
good
time
since
my
husband
little
came
on
for
a
week
there
nothing
like
dressing
a
girl
after
all
and
phyllis
could
only
kiss
her
but
when
her
guest
had
gone
she
laid
all
the
boxes
of
finery
under
her
bed
the
only
place
where
there
was
any
room
she
would
not
take
any
of
it
out
she
determined
till
her
summons
came
but
on
second
thought
she
wore
the
blue
velvet
on
sunday
visits
to
harrington
which
became
she
never
knew
just
when
or
how
a
regular
thing
the
vivid
blue
made
her
eyes
nearly
and
brightened
her
hair
very
satisfactorily
she
was
taking
more
time
and
trouble
over
her
looks
now
one
has
to
live
up
to
a
turquoise
velvet
hat
and
coat
she
found
herself
too
becoming
very
genuinely
fond
of
the
restless
anxiously
loving
passionate
unwise
child
who
dwelt
in
harrington
frail
elderly
body
and
had
almost
worn
it
out
she
sat
long
hours
of
every
sunday
afternoon
holding
harrington
thin
little
hot
hands
and
listening
to
her
swift
italicised
monologues
about
allan
what
he
must
do
what
he
must
not
do
how
he
must
be
looked
after
how
his
mother
had
treated
him
how
his
wishes
must
be
ascertained
and
followed
though
all
he
wants
now
is
dark
and
quiet
said
his
mother
piteously
i
do
even
go
in
there
now
to
cry
she
spoke
as
if
it
were
an
established
ritual
had
she
been
using
her
son
phyllis
wondered
as
a
regular
she
could
feel
in
harrington
even
in
this
mortal
sickness
the
tremendous
driving
influence
which
is
often
part
of
a
passionately
active
and
not
very
wise
personality
that
certitude
and
insistence
of
harrington
could
hammer
you
finally
into
believing
or
doing
almost
anything
phyllis
wondered
how
much
his
mother
heartbroken
adoration
and
pity
might
have
had
to
do
with
making
her
son
as
as
he
was
naturally
the
she
had
acquired
in
such
a
strange
way
became
very
fond
of
phyllis
but
indeed
there
was
something
very
gay
and
sweet
and
about
the
girl
a
something
which
gave
people
the
feeling
that
they
were
very
wise
in
liking
her
some
people
you
are
fond
of
against
your
will
when
people
cared
for
phyllis
it
was
with
a
quite
irrational
feeling
that
they
were
doing
a
sensible
thing
they
never
gave
any
of
the
credit
to
her
very
real
though
almost
invisible
charm
she
never
saw
allan
harrington
on
any
of
the
sunday
visits
she
was
sure
the
servants
thought
she
did
for
she
knew
that
every
one
in
the
great
dark
old
house
knew
her
as
the
young
lady
who
was
to
marry
allan
she
believed
that
she
was
supposed
to
be
an
old
family
friend
perhaps
a
distant
relative
she
did
not
want
to
see
allan
but
she
did
want
to
be
as
good
to
his
little
mother
as
she
could
and
reassure
her
about
allan
future
care
and
she
succeeded
it
was
on
a
friday
about
two
that
the
summons
came
phyllis
had
thought
she
expected
it
but
when
the
call
came
to
her
over
the
library
telephone
she
found
herself
as
badly
frightened
as
she
had
been
the
first
time
she
went
to
the
harrington
house
she
shivered
as
she
laid
down
the
dater
she
was
using
and
called
the
other
librarian
to
take
her
desk
fortunately
between
one
and
four
the
morning
and
evening
shifts
overlapped
and
there
was
some
one
to
take
her
place
harrington
can
not
last
out
the
night
came
de
clear
precise
voice
over
the
telephone
without
preface
i
have
arranged
with
johnston
you
can
go
at
once
you
had
better
pack
a
for
you
possibly
may
not
be
able
to
get
back
to
your
so
it
was
to
happen
now
phyllis
felt
with
her
substitute
in
her
place
her
own
wraps
on
and
her
feet
taking
her
swiftly
towards
her
goal
as
if
she
were
offering
herself
to
be
made
a
nun
or
have
a
hand
or
foot
cut
off
or
paying
herself
away
in
some
awful
irrevocable
fashion
she
packed
mechanically
all
the
pretty
things
de
guenther
had
given
her
and
nothing
else
she
found
herself
at
the
door
of
her
room
with
the
locked
in
her
hand
and
not
even
a
of
the
things
belonging
to
her
old
self
in
it
she
shook
herself
together
managed
to
laugh
a
little
and
returned
and
put
in
such
things
as
she
thought
she
would
require
for
the
night
then
she
went
she
always
remembered
that
journey
as
long
as
she
lived
her
hands
and
feet
and
tongue
going
on
buying
tickets
giving
directions
and
her
mind
like
a
naughty
child
catching
at
everything
as
they
went
and
screaming
to
be
allowed
to
go
back
home
back
to
the
dusty
library
and
the
dreary
little
bedroom
vii
they
were
all
waiting
for
her
in
what
felt
like
a
hideously
quiet
semicircle
in
allan
great
dark
room
harrington
deadly
pale
and
giving
an
impression
of
keeping
herself
alive
only
by
force
of
that
wonderful
fighting
vitality
of
hers
lay
almost
at
length
in
her
there
was
a
clergyman
in
vestments
there
were
the
de
guenthers
de
guenther
only
a
little
more
precise
than
his
habit
was
de
guenther
crying
a
little
softly
and
furtively
as
for
allan
harrington
he
lay
just
as
she
had
seen
him
that
other
time
white
and
moveless
seeming
scarcely
conscious
except
by
an
effort
only
she
noticed
a
slight
contraction
as
of
pain
between
his
brows
phyllis
has
come
panted
harrington
now
it
will
be
all
right
you
must
marry
him
quickly
quickly
do
you
hear
phyllis
oh
people
never
will
do
what
i
want
them
to
yes
yes
indeed
dear
said
phyllis
taking
her
hands
soothingly
we
going
to
attend
to
it
right
away
see
everything
is
ready
it
occurred
to
her
that
harrington
was
not
half
as
correct
in
her
playing
of
the
part
of
a
dying
woman
as
she
would
have
seen
to
it
that
anyone
else
was
also
that
things
did
not
seem
legal
without
the
wolfhound
then
she
was
shocked
at
herself
for
such
irrelevant
thoughts
the
thing
to
do
was
to
keep
poor
harrington
quieted
so
she
beckoned
the
clergyman
and
the
de
guenthers
nearer
and
herself
sped
the
marrying
of
herself
to
allan
harrington
when
you
are
being
married
to
a
crusader
on
a
tomb
the
easiest
way
is
to
kneel
down
by
him
phyllis
registered
this
fact
in
her
mind
quite
blankly
as
something
which
might
be
of
use
to
remember
in
future
the
marrying
took
an
unnecessarily
long
time
it
seemed
to
her
it
did
not
seem
as
if
she
were
being
married
at
all
it
all
seemed
to
concern
somebody
else
when
it
came
to
the
putting
on
of
the
she
found
herself
very
naturally
guiding
allan
relaxed
fingers
to
hold
it
in
its
successive
places
and
finally
slip
it
on
the
and
somehow
having
to
do
that
checked
the
chilly
awe
she
had
had
before
of
allan
harrington
it
made
her
feel
quite
simply
sorry
for
him
as
if
he
were
one
of
her
poor
little
boys
in
trouble
and
when
it
was
all
over
she
bent
pitifully
before
she
thought
and
kissed
one
white
cold
cheek
he
seemed
so
tragically
helpless
yet
more
alive
in
some
way
since
she
had
touched
his
hand
to
guide
it
then
as
her
lips
brushed
his
cheek
she
recoiled
and
colored
a
little
she
had
felt
that
slight
roughness
which
a
man
cheek
however
always
has
the
it
made
her
realize
unreasonably
that
it
was
a
man
she
had
married
after
all
not
a
stone
image
nor
a
sick
child
a
live
man
with
the
thought
or
rather
instinct
came
a
swift
terror
of
what
she
had
done
and
a
swift
impulse
to
rise
she
was
risen
from
her
knees
when
a
hand
on
her
shoulder
and
the
clergyman
voice
in
her
ear
checked
her
not
yet
he
murmured
almost
inaudibly
stay
as
you
are
till
till
harrington
is
wheeled
from
the
room
phyllis
understood
she
remained
as
she
was
her
body
a
shield
before
allan
harrington
eyes
her
hand
just
withdrawing
from
his
shoulder
till
she
heard
the
closing
of
the
door
and
a
sigh
as
of
relaxed
tension
from
the
three
people
around
her
then
she
rose
allan
lay
still
with
closed
eyelids
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
had
flushed
if
ever
so
faintly
at
the
touch
of
her
lips
on
his
cheek
she
laid
his
hand
on
the
coverlet
with
her
own
roughened
ringed
one
and
followed
the
others
out
into
the
room
where
the
dead
woman
had
been
taken
leaving
him
with
his
attendant
the
rest
of
the
evening
phyllis
went
about
in
a
almost
frame
of
mind
it
was
only
the
reaction
from
the
terror
that
was
over
now
but
it
felt
indecorous
it
was
just
as
well
however
some
one
head
had
to
be
kept
the
servants
were
upset
of
course
and
there
were
many
arrangements
to
be
made
she
and
de
guenther
worked
steadily
together
telephoning
ordering
guiding
straightening
out
all
the
tangles
there
never
was
a
wedding
she
thought
where
the
bride
did
so
much
of
the
work
she
even
remembered
to
see
personally
that
allan
dinner
was
sent
up
to
him
the
servants
had
doubtless
been
told
to
come
to
her
for
orders
at
any
rate
they
did
phyllis
had
not
had
much
experience
in
running
a
house
but
a
good
deal
in
keeping
her
head
and
that
after
all
is
the
main
thing
she
had
a
feeling
as
if
she
were
hearing
some
other
young
woman
giving
swift
poised
executive
orders
she
rather
admired
her
after
dinner
the
de
guenthers
went
and
phyllis
braithwaite
the
little
liberry
teacher
who
had
been
living
in
a
hall
bedroom
on
much
less
money
than
she
needed
found
herself
alone
sole
mistress
of
the
great
harrington
house
a
corps
of
servants
a
husband
passive
enough
to
satisfy
the
most
militant
suffragette
a
a
wistful
wolfhound
and
five
hundred
dollars
cash
for
current
expenses
the
last
weighed
on
her
mind
more
than
all
the
rest
put
together
why
i
do
know
how
to
make
current
expenses
out
of
all
that
she
had
said
to
de
guenther
it
looks
to
me
exactly
like
about
ten
months
salary
i
perfectly
certain
i
shall
get
up
in
my
sleep
and
try
to
pay
my
board
ahead
with
it
so
i
sha
have
it
all
spent
before
the
ten
months
are
up
there
was
a
blue
bead
necklace
she
went
on
meditatively
in
the
that
i
always
wanted
to
buy
only
i
never
quite
felt
i
could
afford
it
oh
just
imagine
going
to
the
and
buying
at
least
five
dollars
worth
of
things
you
did
need
you
have
great
discretionary
powers
great
discretionary
powers
my
dear
you
will
find
de
guenther
had
said
as
he
patted
her
shoulder
phyllis
took
it
as
a
compliment
at
the
time
discretionary
powers
sounded
as
if
he
thought
she
was
a
quite
intelligent
young
person
it
did
not
occur
to
her
till
he
had
gone
and
she
was
alone
with
her
that
it
meant
she
had
a
good
deal
of
liberty
to
do
as
she
liked
it
seemed
to
be
expected
of
her
to
stay
nobody
even
suggested
a
possibility
of
her
going
home
again
even
to
pack
her
trunk
de
guenther
casually
volunteered
to
do
that
a
little
after
the
housekeeper
had
told
her
where
her
rooms
were
she
had
been
consulting
with
the
housekeeper
for
what
seemed
ages
when
she
happened
to
want
some
pins
for
something
and
asked
for
her
it
in
your
rooms
said
the
housekeeper
harrington
the
late
harrington
i
should
say
phyllis
stopped
listening
at
this
point
who
was
the
present
harrington
she
wondered
before
she
thought
and
then
remembered
why
was
so
there
was
no
phyllis
braithwaite
any
more
of
course
not
yet
she
had
always
liked
the
name
so
well
a
last
name
was
a
small
thing
to
give
up
into
her
mind
fitted
an
incongruous
silly
story
she
had
heard
once
at
the
library
about
a
girl
whose
last
name
was
rose
and
whose
parents
christened
her
wild
because
the
combination
appealed
to
them
and
then
she
married
a
man
named
bull
meanwhile
the
housekeeper
had
been
going
on
she
had
the
bedroom
and
bath
opening
from
the
other
side
of
allan
ready
for
you
madam
it
been
ready
several
weeks
has
it
said
phyllis
it
was
like
harrington
that
careful
planning
of
even
where
she
should
be
put
is
harrington
in
his
now
for
some
reason
she
did
not
attempt
to
give
herself
she
did
not
want
to
see
him
again
just
now
besides
it
was
nearly
eleven
and
time
a
very
tired
girl
was
in
bed
she
wanted
a
good
night
rest
before
she
had
to
get
up
and
be
harrington
with
allan
and
the
and
the
current
expenses
all
tied
to
her
some
one
had
laid
everything
out
for
her
in
the
bedroom
the
filmy
new
nightgown
over
a
chair
the
blue
satin
mules
underneath
her
plain
on
a
and
over
another
chair
the
exquisite
ivory
crepe
negligee
with
its
floating
rose
ribbons
she
took
a
hasty
bath
there
was
so
much
hot
water
that
she
was
quite
reconciled
for
a
moment
to
being
a
and
wolf
hounded
harrington
and
slid
straight
into
bed
without
even
stopping
to
braid
her
loosened
hair
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
barely
asleep
when
there
came
an
urgent
knocking
at
her
door
yes
she
said
sleepily
looking
mechanically
for
her
as
she
switched
on
the
light
what
is
it
please
it
i
wallis
allan
man
madame
said
a
nervous
voice
allan
very
bad
i
done
all
the
usual
things
but
nothing
seems
to
quiet
him
he
hates
doctors
so
and
they
make
him
so
wrought
up
please
could
you
come
he
says
as
how
all
of
us
are
all
dead
oh
mrs
harrington
there
was
panic
in
the
man
voice
all
right
said
phyllis
sleepily
dropping
to
the
floor
as
she
spoke
with
the
rapidity
that
only
the
know
she
snatched
the
negligee
around
her
and
thrust
her
feet
hastily
into
the
blue
satin
slippers
why
she
was
actually
using
her
wedding
finery
and
what
an
easily
upset
person
that
man
was
but
everybody
in
the
house
seemed
to
have
nerves
on
edge
it
was
no
wonder
about
allan
he
wanted
his
mother
of
course
poor
boy
she
felt
as
she
ran
fleetly
across
the
long
room
that
separated
her
sleeping
quarters
from
her
husband
the
same
mixture
of
pity
and
timidity
that
she
had
felt
with
him
before
poor
boy
poor
silent
beautiful
statue
with
his
one
friend
gone
she
opened
the
door
and
entered
swiftly
into
his
room
she
was
not
thinking
about
herself
at
all
only
of
how
she
could
help
allan
but
there
must
have
been
something
about
her
of
the
angel
to
the
man
lying
tensely
at
length
in
the
darkest
corner
her
long
dully
gold
hair
loosening
from
its
twist
flew
out
about
her
and
her
face
was
still
flushed
with
sleep
there
was
a
something
about
her
that
was
vividly
alight
and
alive
perhaps
the
light
in
her
blue
eyes
from
what
the
man
had
said
phyllis
had
thought
allan
was
delirious
but
she
saw
at
once
that
he
was
only
in
severe
pain
and
talking
more
disconnectedly
perhaps
than
the
englishman
could
follow
he
did
not
look
like
a
statue
now
his
cheeks
were
burning
with
evident
pain
and
his
eyes
and
dilated
to
darkness
stared
straight
out
his
hands
were
clenching
and
unclenching
and
his
head
moved
restlessly
from
side
to
side
every
nerve
and
muscle
she
could
see
was
taut
they
all
dead
he
muttered
father
and
mother
and
louise
and
i
only
i
not
dead
enough
to
bury
oh
god
i
wish
i
was
that
was
delirium
it
was
something
more
like
phyllis
moved
closer
to
him
and
dropped
one
of
her
hands
on
his
cold
clenched
one
oh
poor
boy
she
said
i
so
sorry
so
sorry
she
closed
her
hands
tight
over
both
his
some
of
her
strong
young
vitality
must
have
passed
between
them
and
helped
him
for
almost
immediately
his
tenseness
relaxed
a
little
and
he
looked
at
her
you
you
not
a
nurse
he
said
they
go
around
like
like
a
vault
she
had
caught
his
attention
that
was
a
good
deal
she
felt
she
forgot
everything
about
him
except
that
he
was
some
one
to
be
comforted
and
her
charge
she
sat
down
on
the
bed
by
him
still
holding
tight
to
his
hands
no
indeed
she
said
bending
nearer
him
her
long
loose
hair
falling
forward
about
her
young
face
do
you
remember
seeing
me
i
never
was
a
nurse
what
are
you
he
asked
feebly
i
why
the
children
call
me
the
liberry
teacher
she
answered
it
occurred
to
her
that
it
would
be
better
to
talk
on
brightly
at
random
than
to
risk
speaking
of
his
mother
to
him
as
she
must
if
she
reminded
him
of
their
marriage
i
spend
my
days
in
a
basement
making
bad
little
boys
get
so
interested
in
the
higher
culture
that
they
forget
to
shoot
crap
and
smash
windows
one
of
the
things
which
had
aided
phyllis
to
rise
from
to
one
of
the
children
room
librarians
was
a
very
sweet
and
carrying
voice
a
voice
which
arrested
even
a
child
attention
and
held
his
interest
it
held
allan
now
merely
the
sound
of
it
seemingly
go
on
talking
he
murmured
phyllis
smiled
and
obeyed
sometimes
the
higher
culture
does
work
she
said
yesterday
one
of
my
imps
got
hold
of
a
volume
of
shaw
and
in
half
an
hour
his
aunt
marched
in
on
me
and
threatened
i
do
know
what
to
a
library
that
chilren
to
disrespect
their
lawful
guardeens
i
remember
now
said
allan
you
are
the
girl
in
the
blue
dress
the
girl
mother
had
me
marry
i
remember
yes
said
phyllis
soothingly
and
a
little
apologetically
i
know
but
that
oh
please
it
need
make
a
bit
of
difference
it
was
only
so
i
could
see
that
you
were
looked
after
properly
you
know
i
never
be
in
the
way
unless
you
want
me
to
do
something
for
you
i
do
mind
he
said
listlessly
as
he
had
before
this
dreadful
darkness
and
mother
dead
in
it
somewhere
wallis
called
phyllis
swiftly
turn
up
the
lights
the
man
slipped
the
close
green
silk
shades
from
the
electric
bulbs
allan
shrank
as
if
he
had
been
hurt
i
ca
stand
the
glare
he
cried
yes
you
can
for
a
moment
she
said
firmly
it
better
than
the
ghastly
green
glow
it
was
probably
the
first
time
allan
harrington
had
been
contradicted
since
his
accident
he
said
nothing
more
for
a
minute
and
phyllis
directed
wallis
to
bring
a
sheet
of
pink
tissue
paper
from
her
where
she
remembered
it
lay
in
the
folds
of
some
new
muslin
thing
under
her
direction
still
he
wrapped
the
globes
in
it
and
secured
it
with
string
there
she
told
allan
triumphantly
when
wallis
was
done
see
there
is
no
glare
now
only
a
pretty
glow
better
than
the
green
is
it
allan
looked
at
her
again
you
are
kind
he
said
mother
said
you
would
be
kind
oh
mother
mother
he
tried
uselessly
to
lift
one
arm
to
cover
his
convulsed
face
and
could
only
turn
his
head
a
little
aside
you
can
go
wallis
said
phyllis
softly
with
her
lips
only
be
in
the
next
room
the
man
stole
out
and
shut
the
door
softly
phyllis
herself
rose
and
went
toward
the
window
and
busied
herself
in
braiding
up
her
hair
there
was
almost
silence
in
the
room
for
a
few
minutes
thank
you
said
allan
brokenly
will
you
come
back
please
she
returned
swiftly
and
sat
by
him
as
she
had
before
would
you
mind
holding
my
wrists
again
he
asked
i
feel
quieter
somehow
when
you
do
not
so
lost
there
was
a
pathetic
boyishness
in
his
tone
that
the
sad
clear
lines
of
his
face
would
never
prepare
you
for
phyllis
took
his
wrists
in
her
warm
strong
hands
obediently
are
you
in
pain
allan
she
asked
do
you
mind
if
i
call
you
allan
it
the
easiest
way
he
smiled
at
her
a
little
faintly
it
occurred
to
her
that
perhaps
the
novelty
of
her
was
taking
his
mind
a
little
from
his
own
feelings
no
no
pain
i
have
had
any
for
a
very
long
time
now
only
this
dreadful
blackness
dragging
at
my
mind
a
blackness
the
light
hurts
said
phyllis
to
herself
being
on
known
ground
here
why
nervous
depression
i
believe
help
i
know
she
said
aloud
i
had
it
you
he
said
but
you
seem
so
happy
i
suppose
i
am
said
phyllis
shyly
she
felt
a
little
afraid
of
poor
allan
still
now
that
there
was
nothing
to
do
for
him
and
they
were
talking
together
and
he
had
not
answered
her
question
either
doubtless
he
wanted
her
to
say
allan
or
even
mr
harrington
he
replied
to
her
thought
in
the
uncanny
way
invalids
sometimes
do
you
said
something
about
what
we
were
to
call
each
other
he
murmured
it
would
be
foolish
of
course
not
to
use
first
names
yours
is
alice
is
it
phyllis
laughed
oh
worse
than
that
she
said
i
was
named
out
of
a
poetrybook
i
believe
phyllis
narcissa
but
i
always
conceal
the
narcissa
phyllis
thank
you
he
said
wearily
do
let
go
to
me
his
eyes
were
those
of
a
man
in
torment
what
shall
i
talk
about
she
asked
soothingly
keeping
the
two
cold
clutching
hands
in
her
warm
grasp
shall
i
tell
you
a
story
i
know
a
great
many
stories
by
heart
and
i
will
say
them
for
you
if
you
like
it
was
part
of
my
work
yes
he
said
anything
phyllis
arranged
herself
more
comfortably
on
the
bed
for
it
looked
as
if
she
had
some
time
to
stay
and
began
the
story
she
knew
best
because
her
children
liked
it
best
kipling
how
the
elephant
got
his
trunk
a
long
long
time
ago
o
best
beloved
allan
listened
and
she
thought
at
times
paid
attention
to
the
words
he
almost
smiled
once
or
twice
she
was
nearly
sure
she
went
straight
on
to
another
story
when
the
first
was
done
never
had
she
worked
so
hard
to
keep
the
interest
of
any
restless
circle
of
children
as
she
worked
now
sitting
up
in
the
pink
light
in
her
crepe
wrappings
with
her
braids
hanging
down
over
her
bosom
and
allan
harrington
agonized
eyes
fixed
on
her
pitying
ones
you
must
be
tired
he
said
more
connectedly
and
quietly
when
she
had
ended
the
second
story
ca
you
sit
up
here
by
me
propped
on
the
pillows
and
you
need
a
quilt
or
something
too
this
from
an
invalid
who
had
been
given
nothing
but
himself
to
think
of
this
seven
years
back
phyllis
opinion
of
allan
went
up
very
much
she
had
supposed
he
would
be
very
selfish
but
she
made
herself
a
bank
of
pillows
and
arranged
herself
by
allan
side
so
that
she
could
keep
fast
to
his
hands
without
any
strain
something
as
skaters
hold
she
wrapped
a
down
quilt
from
the
foot
of
the
bed
around
her
and
went
on
to
her
third
story
allan
eyes
as
she
talked
on
grew
less
intent
drooped
she
felt
the
relaxation
of
his
hands
she
went
monotonously
on
closing
her
own
eyes
just
for
a
minute
as
she
finished
her
story
viii
i
overslept
the
alarm
was
phyllis
first
thought
next
morning
when
she
woke
it
must
be
where
was
she
so
tired
so
very
tired
she
remembered
being
and
telling
some
one
an
interminable
story
she
held
her
sleepy
eyes
wide
open
by
and
found
that
a
silent
but
evidently
going
clock
hung
in
sight
then
she
overslept
the
alarm
but
she
had
set
any
alarm
and
she
had
been
sleeping
propped
up
in
a
sitting
position
half
on
why
it
was
a
shoulder
and
she
was
rolled
tight
in
a
down
quilt
she
sat
up
with
a
jerk
fortunately
a
noiseless
one
and
turned
to
look
then
suddenly
she
remembered
all
about
it
that
jumbled
excited
yesterday
which
had
held
change
and
death
and
marriage
for
her
and
which
she
had
ended
by
perching
on
poor
allan
harrington
bed
and
sending
him
to
sleep
by
holding
his
hands
and
telling
him
children
stories
she
must
have
fallen
asleep
after
he
did
and
slid
down
on
his
shoulder
a
wonder
it
had
disturbed
him
she
stole
another
look
at
him
as
he
lay
sleeping
still
heavily
and
quietly
after
all
she
was
married
to
him
and
she
had
a
perfect
right
to
recite
him
to
sleep
if
she
wanted
to
she
unrolled
herself
cautiously
and
slid
out
like
a
shadow
she
almost
fell
over
poor
wallis
sleeping
too
in
his
clothes
outside
the
door
on
allan
day
couch
he
came
quickly
to
his
feet
as
if
he
were
used
to
sudden
waking
do
disturb
harrington
said
phyllis
as
staidly
as
if
she
had
been
giving
orders
in
her
all
her
life
he
seems
to
be
sleeping
quietly
begging
your
pardon
harrington
but
you
have
been
giving
him
anything
have
you
asked
wallis
he
has
slept
without
a
break
for
two
hours
to
my
knowledge
since
i
been
here
not
without
medicine
not
a
thing
said
phyllis
smiling
with
satisfaction
he
must
have
been
sleeping
nearly
three
hours
now
i
read
him
to
sleep
or
what
amounted
to
it
i
got
his
nerves
quiet
i
think
please
kill
anybody
that
tries
to
wake
him
wallis
very
good
said
wallis
gravely
and
yourself
i
going
to
get
some
sleep
too
she
said
call
me
if
anything
useful
she
meant
necessary
but
she
wanted
so
much
more
sleep
she
never
knew
the
difference
when
she
got
into
her
room
she
found
that
there
also
she
was
not
alone
the
wistful
wolfhound
was
curled
plaintively
across
her
bed
which
he
overlapped
from
his
nose
he
seemed
to
have
been
dipping
largely
into
the
cup
of
chocolate
somebody
had
brought
to
her
and
which
she
had
forgotten
to
drink
when
she
found
it
on
her
first
retiring
you
are
a
said
phyllis
indignantly
she
was
too
sleepy
to
do
more
than
shove
him
over
to
the
back
of
the
bed
all
the
beds
here
are
so
she
complained
sleepily
and
crawled
inside
and
never
woke
again
till
nearly
afternoon
there
was
all
the
grave
business
to
be
done
in
the
days
that
followed
of
taking
harrington
to
a
quiet
place
beside
her
husband
and
drawing
together
again
the
strings
of
the
disorganized
household
phyllis
found
herself
whispering
over
and
over
again
the
sweeping
up
the
heart
and
putting
love
away
we
shall
not
need
to
use
again
until
the
judgment
day
and
with
all
there
was
to
see
after
it
was
some
days
before
she
saw
allan
again
more
than
to
speak
to
brightly
as
she
crossed
their
common
he
did
not
ask
for
her
she
looked
after
his
comfort
faithfully
and
tried
to
see
to
it
that
his
man
wallis
was
all
he
should
be
a
task
which
was
almost
hopeless
from
the
fact
that
wallis
knew
much
more
about
his
duties
than
she
did
even
with
painstakingly
detailed
notes
to
help
her
also
his
attitude
to
his
master
was
of
such
untiring
patience
and
worship
that
it
made
phyllis
feel
like
a
rude
outsider
interfering
between
man
and
wife
however
wallis
was
inclined
to
approve
of
his
new
mistress
who
was
not
fussy
seemed
kind
and
had
given
his
beloved
allan
nearly
three
hours
of
unbroken
sleep
allan
had
been
a
little
better
ever
since
wallis
had
told
phyllis
this
but
she
was
inclined
to
think
that
the
betterment
was
caused
by
the
of
his
mother
death
which
had
shaken
him
from
his
lethargy
and
perhaps
even
given
his
nerves
a
better
balance
and
she
insisted
that
the
pink
paper
stay
on
the
electric
lights
after
about
a
week
of
this
phyllis
suddenly
remembered
that
she
had
not
been
selfish
at
all
yet
where
was
her
the
garden
she
had
married
the
wolfhound
and
allan
and
the
for
where
were
all
the
things
she
had
intended
to
get
the
only
item
she
had
bought
as
yet
ran
on
the
charge
account
she
had
taken
over
with
the
rest
doz
checked
and
clancy
the
housekeeper
pressing
demand
was
responsible
for
these
it
certainly
time
i
was
selfish
said
phyllis
to
the
wolfhound
who
followed
her
round
unendingly
as
if
she
had
patches
of
sunshine
in
her
pocket
glorious
patches
fit
for
a
wolfhound
perhaps
he
was
grateful
because
she
had
ordered
him
long
daily
walks
he
wagged
his
tail
now
as
she
spoke
and
rubbed
himself
curvingly
against
her
he
was
a
rather
affected
dog
so
phyllis
made
herself
out
a
list
in
a
superlatively
neat
library
hand
one
string
of
blue
beads
one
lot
of
very
fluffy
summer
frocks
with
flowers
on
them
one
one
banjo
and
a
and
a
room
one
set
arabian
nights
one
set
of
stevenson
all
but
his
novels
ever
so
many
maxfield
parrish
pictures
full
of
skies
a
house
to
put
them
in
with
fireplaces
a
lady
size
that
likes
me
a
plain
cat
with
a
tame
disposition
a
hammock
a
but
that
might
be
thrown
in
with
the
garden
a
gold
all
the
colored
satin
slippers
i
want
a
room
big
enough
to
put
all
father
books
up
it
looked
shamelessly
long
but
phyllis
discretionary
powers
would
cover
it
she
knew
harrington
final
will
while
full
of
advice
had
been
recklessly
trusting
she
could
order
everything
in
one
afternoon
she
was
sure
all
but
the
house
the
garden
the
motor
which
she
put
checks
against
and
the
plain
cat
which
she
thought
she
could
pick
up
in
the
village
where
her
house
would
be
next
she
went
to
see
allan
she
did
want
to
bother
him
but
she
did
feel
that
she
ought
to
share
her
plans
with
him
as
far
as
possible
besides
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
could
scarcely
remember
what
he
was
like
to
speak
to
and
really
owed
it
to
herself
to
go
she
fluffed
out
her
hair
loosely
put
on
her
gown
that
had
clinging
lines
and
pulled
some
daffodils
through
her
sash
she
had
resolved
to
avoid
anything
sombre
where
allan
was
concerned
and
the
green
gown
was
very
becoming
then
armed
with
her
list
and
a
pencil
she
crossed
boldly
to
the
couch
where
her
crusader
lay
in
the
old
attitude
moveless
and
with
eyes
allan
she
asked
standing
above
him
do
you
think
you
could
stand
being
talked
to
for
a
little
while
why
yes
said
allan
opening
his
eyes
a
little
more
wallis
get
harrington
a
chair
he
said
the
name
haltingly
and
phyllis
wondered
if
he
disliked
her
having
it
she
dropped
down
beside
him
like
a
smiling
touch
of
spring
in
the
dark
room
do
you
mind
their
calling
me
that
she
asked
if
there
anything
else
they
could
use
mother
made
you
a
present
of
the
name
he
said
smiling
faintly
no
reason
why
i
should
mind
all
right
said
phyllis
cheerfully
after
all
there
was
nothing
else
to
call
her
speaking
of
her
the
servants
she
knew
generally
said
the
young
madam
as
if
her
were
still
alive
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
things
she
began
and
had
to
stop
to
deal
with
the
wolfhound
who
was
trying
to
put
both
paws
on
her
shoulders
oh
ivan
down
honey
i
somebody
would
take
a
day
off
some
time
to
explain
to
you
that
you
not
a
do
you
like
wolfhounds
specially
better
than
any
other
kind
of
dog
allan
not
particularly
said
allan
patting
the
dog
languidly
as
he
put
his
head
in
a
convenient
place
for
the
purpose
mother
bought
him
she
said
because
he
would
look
so
picturesque
in
my
she
wanted
him
to
lie
at
my
feet
or
something
but
he
never
saw
it
that
way
neither
did
i
hates
do
blame
him
this
was
the
longest
speech
allan
had
made
yet
and
phyllis
learned
several
things
from
it
that
she
had
only
guessed
before
one
was
that
the
atmosphere
of
embodied
grief
and
regret
in
the
house
had
been
harrington
not
allan
that
he
was
more
young
and
natural
than
she
had
thought
better
material
for
cheering
that
his
mother
devotion
had
been
something
of
a
pressure
on
him
at
times
and
that
he
himself
was
not
interested
in
efforts
to
stage
his
illness
correctly
what
he
really
had
said
when
the
dog
was
introduced
she
learned
later
from
the
attached
wallis
was
that
he
might
be
a
cripple
but
he
going
to
be
part
of
any
confounded
tableau
whereupon
his
mother
had
cried
for
an
hour
kissing
and
pitying
him
in
between
and
his
night
had
been
worse
than
usual
but
the
hound
had
stayed
outside
phyllis
made
an
instant
addition
to
her
list
one
convenient
size
for
allan
the
plain
cat
could
wait
she
had
heard
of
publicity
campaigns
she
had
made
up
her
mind
and
a
rather
firm
young
mind
it
was
that
she
was
going
to
conduct
a
cheerfulness
campaign
in
behalf
of
this
listless
beautiful
allan
of
hers
unknowingly
she
was
beginning
to
regard
him
as
much
her
property
as
the
and
rather
more
so
than
the
wolfhound
she
moved
back
a
little
and
reconciled
herself
to
the
dog
who
had
draped
as
much
of
his
body
as
would
go
over
her
and
was
batting
his
tail
against
her
joyfully
poor
old
puppy
she
said
i
want
to
talk
over
some
plans
with
you
allan
she
began
again
determinedly
she
was
astonished
to
see
allan
wince
he
said
for
heaven
sake
you
drive
me
crazy
phyllis
drew
back
a
little
indignantly
but
behind
the
couch
she
saw
wallis
making
some
sort
of
face
that
was
evidently
intended
for
a
warning
then
he
slipped
out
of
the
room
as
if
he
wished
her
to
follow
soon
and
be
explained
to
plans
must
be
a
forbidden
subject
anyhow
crossness
was
a
better
symptom
than
apathy
very
well
she
said
brightly
smiling
her
old
useful
library
smile
at
him
it
was
mostly
about
things
i
wanted
to
buy
for
myself
any
way
satin
slippers
and
such
i
suppose
they
interest
a
man
much
oh
that
sort
of
thing
said
allan
relievedly
i
thought
you
meant
things
that
had
to
do
with
me
if
you
have
plans
about
me
go
ahead
for
you
know
i
ca
do
anything
to
stop
you
but
for
heaven
sake
discuss
it
with
me
first
he
spoke
carelessly
but
the
pity
of
it
struck
to
phyllis
heart
it
was
true
he
could
stop
her
his
foolish
adoring
little
desperate
mother
in
her
anxiety
to
have
her
boy
taken
good
care
of
had
exposed
him
to
a
cruel
risk
phyllis
knew
herself
to
be
trustworthy
she
knew
that
she
could
no
more
put
her
own
pleasures
before
her
charge
welfare
than
she
could
steal
his
watch
her
conscience
was
rock
but
oh
suppose
de
guenther
had
chosen
some
girl
who
did
care
who
would
have
taken
the
money
and
not
have
done
the
work
she
shivered
at
the
thought
of
what
allan
had
escaped
and
caught
his
hand
impulsively
as
she
had
on
that
other
night
of
terror
oh
allan
harrington
i
do
anything
i
ought
to
i
know
it
dreadful
having
a
strange
girl
wished
on
you
this
way
but
truly
i
mean
to
be
as
good
as
i
can
and
never
in
the
way
or
anything
indeed
you
may
trust
me
you
you
do
mind
having
me
round
do
you
allan
cold
hand
closed
kindly
on
hers
he
spoke
for
the
first
time
as
a
well
man
speaks
quietly
connectedly
and
with
a
little
authority
the
fact
that
i
am
married
to
you
does
not
weigh
on
me
at
all
my
dear
child
he
said
i
shall
be
dead
you
know
this
time
five
years
and
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
i
married
or
not
i
do
mind
you
at
all
you
seem
a
very
kind
and
pleasant
person
i
am
sure
i
can
trust
you
now
are
you
reassured
oh
said
phyllis
radiantly
and
you
trust
me
and
i
fuss
all
you
have
to
do
if
i
bore
you
is
to
look
bored
you
can
you
know
you
do
know
how
well
you
do
it
and
i
stop
going
to
ask
wallis
how
much
of
my
society
you
better
have
if
any
why
i
do
think
a
good
deal
of
it
would
hurt
me
he
said
indifferently
but
he
smiled
in
a
quite
friendly
fashion
all
right
said
phyllis
again
brightly
but
she
fell
silent
then
there
were
two
kinds
of
allan
she
reflected
this
kind
of
allan
who
was
very
much
more
and
wise
than
she
was
and
of
whom
she
still
stood
a
little
in
awe
and
the
allan
who
had
clung
to
her
in
nervous
dread
of
the
dark
the
other
night
whom
she
had
sent
to
sleep
with
children
stories
she
wondered
which
was
real
which
he
had
been
when
he
was
well
i
must
go
now
and
have
something
out
with
clancy
she
said
smiling
and
rising
she
perfectly
certain
carpets
have
to
come
up
when
you
put
down
mattings
and
i
perfectly
certain
they
do
she
tucked
the
despised
list
to
which
she
had
furtively
added
her
into
her
sleeve
took
her
hand
from
his
and
went
away
it
seemed
to
allan
that
the
room
was
a
little
darker
ix
outside
the
door
stood
wallis
who
had
been
lying
in
wait
i
wanted
to
explain
madam
about
the
plans
he
said
it
worries
allan
you
see
madam
the
late
harrington
was
a
great
one
for
plans
she
had
if
i
may
say
so
a
new
one
every
day
and
she
argue
you
deaf
dumb
and
blind
not
to
speak
ill
of
the
dead
till
you
were
fair
beat
out
fighting
it
then
you
settle
down
to
it
and
next
day
there
be
another
one
with
harrington
rooting
for
it
just
as
hard
and
you
with
your
mouth
fixed
for
the
other
plan
so
to
speak
would
have
to
give
in
to
that
the
plan
she
happened
to
have
last
always
went
through
because
she
fought
for
that
as
hard
as
she
had
for
the
others
and
you
were
so
bothered
by
then
you
did
care
what
wallis
carefully
impersonal
had
slipped
from
him
and
he
was
talking
to
phyllis
as
man
to
man
but
she
was
very
glad
of
it
these
were
the
sort
of
facts
she
had
to
elicit
when
allan
was
well
he
went
on
he
used
to
just
laugh
and
say
right
mother
darling
and
pet
her
and
do
his
own
way
he
was
always
laughing
and
carrying
on
then
allan
but
after
he
was
hurt
of
course
he
could
get
away
and
the
old
madam
she
sit
by
his
couch
by
the
hour
and
he
nearly
wild
making
plans
for
him
she
spend
weeks
planning
details
of
things
over
and
over
never
getting
tired
and
then
off
again
to
the
next
thing
it
was
all
because
she
was
so
fond
of
him
you
see
but
if
you
pardon
my
saying
so
madam
wallis
was
resuming
his
manners
it
was
not
always
good
for
mr
allan
i
think
i
understand
said
phyllis
thoughtfully
as
she
and
the
wolfhound
went
to
interview
clancy
so
that
was
why
she
had
imagined
something
of
the
sort
and
she
she
herself
was
doubtless
the
outcome
of
one
of
harrington
plans
insisted
on
to
allan
till
he
had
acquiesced
for
quiet
sake
but
he
said
now
he
did
mind
she
was
somehow
sure
he
would
have
said
it
if
it
had
not
been
true
then
wallis
other
words
came
to
her
he
was
always
laughing
then
and
suddenly
there
surged
up
in
phyllis
a
passionate
resolve
to
give
allan
back
at
least
a
little
of
his
lightness
of
heart
he
might
be
going
to
die
though
she
did
believe
it
but
at
least
she
could
make
things
less
monotonous
and
dark
for
him
and
she
offer
him
plans
and
if
he
objected
when
the
plans
rose
up
and
hit
him
why
the
shock
might
do
him
good
she
thought
she
was
fairly
sure
of
an
ally
in
wallis
she
cut
her
interview
with
clancy
short
allan
lying
motionless
caught
a
green
flash
of
her
crossing
into
her
room
to
dress
another
blue
flash
as
she
went
out
dropped
his
eyelids
and
crossed
his
hands
to
doze
a
little
an
innocent
and
unwary
crusader
he
did
not
know
it
but
a
plan
was
about
to
rise
up
and
hit
him
the
bride
his
mother
had
left
him
as
a
parting
legacy
had
gone
out
to
order
a
string
of
blue
beads
a
a
house
a
motor
a
banjo
and
a
as
she
went
she
added
a
talking
machine
to
the
list
and
he
was
to
be
planted
in
the
very
centre
of
everything
seems
like
a
nice
girl
wallis
said
allan
dreamily
and
the
discreet
wallis
said
nothing
though
he
knew
a
good
deal
about
his
yes
allan
he
conceded
it
was
phyllis
harrington
firm
belief
that
de
guenther
could
produce
anything
anybody
wanted
at
any
time
or
that
if
he
could
his
wife
could
so
it
was
to
him
that
she
went
on
her
quest
for
the
with
its
incidental
house
the
rest
of
the
items
she
thought
she
could
get
for
herself
it
was
nearly
the
last
of
april
and
she
wanted
a
elderly
mansion
preferably
colonial
not
too
unwieldily
large
with
as
many
around
it
as
her
discretionary
powers
would
stand
and
she
wanted
it
as
near
and
as
soon
as
possible
by
the
help
of
de
guenther
amused
but
efficient
de
guenther
efficient
but
sentimental
and
an
agent
who
was
efficient
merely
she
got
very
nearly
what
she
wanted
money
could
do
a
great
deal
more
than
a
country
minister
daughter
had
ever
had
any
way
of
imagining
by
its
aid
she
found
it
possible
to
have
furniture
bought
and
placed
inside
a
fortnight
even
to
a
list
of
books
set
up
in
sliding
sectional
cases
she
had
hoped
to
buy
those
cases
some
day
one
at
a
time
and
getting
them
at
one
fell
swoop
seemed
to
her
more
arrogantly
opulent
than
the
purchase
of
the
house
and
grounds
than
even
the
big
shiny
victrola
she
had
bought
that
herself
before
there
was
a
house
to
put
it
in
going
on
the
principle
that
all
men
not
professional
musicians
have
a
concealed
passion
for
music
that
they
can
create
themselves
by
merely
winding
up
something
and
to
anticipate
she
found
that
as
far
as
allan
was
concerned
she
was
quite
right
but
why
do
you
take
this
very
radical
step
my
dear
asked
de
guenther
gently
as
she
helped
phyllis
choose
furniture
i
am
going
to
try
the
only
thing
allan
mother
seems
to
have
omitted
said
phyllis
dauntlessly
a
complete
change
of
surroundings
oh
my
dear
breathed
de
guenther
it
may
help
poor
allan
more
than
we
know
and
dear
angela
did
discuss
moving
often
but
she
could
never
bear
to
leave
the
city
house
where
so
many
of
her
dear
ones
have
passed
away
well
none
of
dear
ones
are
going
to
pass
away
there
said
phyllis
irreverently
unless
clancy
wants
to
i
not
even
taking
any
servants
but
wallis
the
does
need
any
more
than
a
cook
a
chambermaid
and
outdoor
man
clancy
is
getting
them
i
told
her
i
did
care
what
age
or
color
she
chose
but
they
had
to
be
cheerful
she
will
stay
in
the
city
and
keep
the
others
straight
in
something
she
calls
i
starting
absolutely
fresh
they
were
back
at
de
guenther
house
by
the
time
phyllis
was
done
telling
her
plans
phyllis
sitting
in
the
identical
pluffy
chair
where
she
had
made
her
decision
to
marry
allan
de
guenther
sprang
from
her
own
chair
and
came
over
and
impulsively
kissed
her
god
bless
you
dear
she
said
i
believe
it
was
heaven
that
inspired
albert
and
myself
to
choose
you
to
carry
on
poor
angela
work
phyllis
flushed
indignantly
i
undoing
a
little
of
it
i
hope
she
said
passionately
if
i
can
only
make
that
poor
boy
forget
some
of
those
dreadful
years
she
spent
crying
over
him
i
sha
have
lived
in
vain
de
guenther
looked
at
phyllis
earnestly
and
most
unexpectedly
burst
into
a
little
tinkling
laugh
my
dear
she
said
mischievously
what
about
all
the
fine
things
you
were
going
to
do
for
yourself
to
make
up
for
being
tied
to
poor
allan
you
should
really
stop
being
unselfish
and
enjoy
yourself
a
little
phyllis
felt
herself
flushing
crimson
elderly
people
did
seem
to
be
so
sentimental
i
bought
myself
lots
of
things
she
defended
herself
most
of
this
is
really
for
me
and
i
ca
help
being
good
to
him
it
only
common
humanity
i
was
never
so
sorry
for
anybody
in
my
life
you
be
too
if
it
were
de
guenther
she
thought
her
explanation
was
complete
but
she
must
have
said
something
that
she
did
not
realize
for
de
guenther
only
laughed
her
little
tinkling
laugh
again
and
as
is
the
fashion
of
elderly
people
kissed
her
i
would
indeed
my
dear
said
she
x
allan
harrington
lay
in
his
old
attitude
on
his
couch
in
the
darkened
his
tired
face
a
little
thrown
back
eyes
he
was
not
thinking
of
anything
or
any
one
especially
merely
wrapped
in
a
web
of
the
dragging
empty
gray
of
weariness
in
general
that
had
hung
about
him
so
many
years
wallis
was
not
there
wallis
had
been
with
him
much
less
lately
and
he
had
scarcely
seen
phyllis
for
a
fortnight
or
for
the
matter
of
that
the
dog
or
any
one
at
all
something
was
going
on
he
supposed
but
he
scarcely
troubled
himself
to
wonder
what
the
girl
was
doubtless
making
herself
boudoirs
or
something
of
the
sort
in
a
new
part
of
the
house
he
closed
his
eyes
entirely
there
in
the
dusky
room
and
let
the
web
of
dreary
gray
formless
thought
wrap
him
again
phyllis
gay
sweetly
carrying
voice
rang
from
outside
the
door
the
then
wallis
and
i
feel
as
if
i
were
going
to
steal
charlie
ross
well
on
the
last
word
she
broke
off
and
pushed
the
door
softly
open
and
slid
in
she
walked
in
a
fashion
which
would
have
suggested
to
any
one
watching
her
a
dark
burden
on
her
conscience
she
crossed
straight
to
the
couch
looked
around
for
the
chair
that
should
have
been
by
it
but
was
and
sat
absently
down
on
the
floor
she
liked
floors
allan
she
said
no
answer
allan
still
none
allan
was
or
what
did
instead
in
one
of
his
abstracted
moods
harrington
this
time
she
reached
up
and
pulled
at
his
heavy
silk
sleeve
as
she
spoke
yes
said
allan
courteously
as
if
from
an
infinite
distance
would
you
mind
asked
phyllis
guilelessly
if
wallis
we
moved
you
a
little
i
can
tell
you
all
about
everything
unless
you
rather
not
have
the
full
details
of
the
plan
anything
said
allan
wearily
from
the
depths
of
his
gray
cloud
only
do
me
about
it
phyllis
jumped
to
her
feet
a
whirl
of
gay
blue
skirts
and
cheerfully
tossing
blue
feathers
dear
crusader
she
said
with
a
catch
in
her
voice
that
might
have
been
either
a
laugh
or
a
sob
the
next
time
you
see
me
you
probably
me
wallis
wallis
appeared
like
the
slave
of
the
lamp
it
all
right
wallis
she
said
and
ran
wallis
proceeded
thereupon
to
wheel
his
couch
into
the
bedroom
if
you
going
to
be
moved
you
better
be
dressed
a
little
heavier
sir
he
said
with
the
same
amiable
guilelessness
if
the
victim
had
but
noticed
it
which
phyllis
had
used
from
her
seat
on
the
floor
not
long
before
very
well
said
allan
resignedly
from
his
cloud
and
wallis
proceeded
to
suit
the
action
to
the
word
allan
let
him
go
on
in
unnoticing
silence
till
it
came
to
that
totally
unfamiliar
thing
these
seven
years
a
collar
a
shiningly
new
linen
collar
of
the
newest
cut
a
beautiful
knit
tie
a
gray
suit
what
on
earth
inquired
allan
awakening
from
his
lethargy
i
need
a
collar
and
tie
to
keep
me
from
getting
cold
on
a
journey
across
the
house
and
where
did
you
get
those
clothes
they
look
new
wallis
laid
his
now
fully
dressed
master
back
to
a
reclining
position
he
had
been
propped
up
and
tucked
a
handkerchief
into
the
appropriate
pocket
as
he
replied
grant
moxley
sir
where
you
always
deal
and
he
wheeled
the
couch
back
to
the
over
to
its
very
door
it
did
not
occur
to
allan
as
he
was
being
carried
downstairs
by
wallis
and
arthur
another
of
the
servants
that
anything
more
than
a
change
of
rooms
was
intended
nor
as
he
was
carried
out
at
its
door
to
a
long
closed
carriage
that
it
was
anything
worse
than
his
new
mistaken
idea
that
drives
would
be
good
for
him
he
was
a
little
irritable
at
the
length
and
shutupness
of
the
drive
though
as
his
cot
had
been
swung
deftly
from
the
ceiling
of
the
carriage
he
was
not
jarred
but
when
wallis
and
arthur
carried
the
light
pallet
on
which
he
lay
swiftly
up
a
plank
walk
laid
to
the
door
of
a
private
car
why
then
it
began
to
occur
to
allan
harrington
that
something
was
happening
and
which
rather
surprised
himself
he
did
not
lift
a
supercilious
eyebrow
and
say
in
a
soft
apathetic
voice
very
instead
he
turned
his
head
towards
the
devoted
wallis
who
had
helped
two
conductors
swing
the
cot
from
the
ceiling
and
was
now
waiting
for
the
storm
to
break
and
what
he
said
to
wallis
was
this
what
the
deuce
does
this
tomfoolery
mean
as
he
spoke
he
felt
the
accumulated
capacity
for
temper
of
the
last
seven
years
surging
up
toward
wallis
and
arthur
and
phyllis
and
the
and
everything
else
down
to
the
two
conductors
wallis
seemed
rather
relieved
than
otherwise
waiting
for
a
storm
to
break
is
rather
wearing
well
sir
harrington
she
thought
sir
that
that
a
little
move
would
do
you
good
and
you
did
want
to
be
bothered
sir
bothered
shouted
allan
not
at
all
like
a
bored
and
dying
invalid
i
should
think
i
did
when
a
change
in
my
whole
way
of
life
is
made
who
gave
you
or
harrington
permission
for
this
outrageous
performance
it
sheer
brutal
insulting
idiocy
nobody
sir
yes
sir
replied
wallis
meekly
would
you
care
for
a
drink
sir
or
anything
thundered
allan
or
a
fan
ventured
wallis
approaching
near
with
that
article
and
laying
it
on
the
coverlid
allan
hand
snatched
the
fan
angrily
and
before
he
thought
he
had
hurled
it
at
wallis
weakly
it
is
true
for
it
lighted
ingloriously
about
five
feet
away
but
he
had
it
with
a
movement
that
must
have
put
to
use
the
muscles
of
the
upper
arm
wallis
sat
suddenly
down
and
caught
his
breath
mr
allan
he
said
do
you
know
what
you
did
then
you
and
you
have
been
able
to
use
more
than
your
forearm
before
oh
allan
you
getting
better
allan
himself
lay
in
astonishment
at
his
feat
and
forgot
to
be
angry
for
a
moment
i
certainly
did
he
said
and
the
way
you
lost
your
temper
went
on
wallis
enthusiastically
oh
allan
it
was
beautiful
you
have
been
more
than
to
say
snarly
since
the
accident
it
was
so
like
the
way
you
used
to
throw
but
at
the
mention
of
his
lost
temper
allan
remembered
to
lose
it
still
further
his
old
capacity
for
storming
a
healthy
lad
healthy
young
had
been
weakened
by
long
disuse
but
he
did
fairly
well
secretly
it
was
a
pleasure
to
him
to
find
that
he
was
alive
enough
to
care
what
happened
enough
for
anger
he
demanded
presently
where
he
was
going
not
more
than
two
hours
ride
sir
i
heard
de
guenther
mention
answered
wallis
at
once
a
little
place
called
wallraven
quite
country
sir
i
believe
so
the
de
guenthers
are
in
it
too
said
allan
what
the
dickens
has
this
girl
done
to
them
to
hypnotize
them
so
but
i
heard
say
it
a
very
pretty
place
sir
was
all
wallis
vouchsafed
to
this
the
de
guenthers
were
not
the
only
people
phyllis
had
hypnotized
he
gave
allan
other
details
as
they
went
on
however
his
clothes
and
personal
belongings
were
coming
on
immediately
there
were
two
perhaps
he
had
noticed
in
the
car
with
them
the
young
madam
was
planning
to
stay
all
the
summer
he
believed
clancy
had
been
left
behind
to
look
after
the
other
servants
and
he
understood
that
she
had
seen
to
the
engagement
of
a
fresh
staff
of
servants
for
the
country
and
allan
still
awakened
by
his
fit
of
temper
and
fresh
from
the
monotony
of
his
seven
years
seclusion
found
all
the
things
wallis
could
tell
him
very
interesting
phyllis
house
had
among
other
virtues
the
charm
of
being
near
the
little
station
a
new
little
mission
station
which
had
apparently
been
called
wallraven
by
some
poetic
young
agency
for
the
surrounding
countryside
looked
countrified
enough
to
be
a
gray
corners
or
smith
crossing
or
some
other
such
placid
old
country
name
there
were
more
trees
to
be
seen
in
allan
quick
passage
from
the
train
to
the
long
old
carryall
whose
seats
had
been
removed
to
make
room
for
his
cot
than
he
had
remembered
existed
there
were
sleepy
birds
to
be
heard
too
talking
about
how
near
sunset
and
their
bedtime
had
come
and
a
little
brook
splashed
somewhere
out
of
sight
altogether
spring
was
to
be
seen
and
heard
and
felt
winningly
insistent
allan
forgave
wallis
not
to
speak
of
phyllis
and
the
conductors
to
a
certain
degree
he
ordered
the
flapping
black
oilcloth
curtain
in
front
rolled
up
so
he
could
see
out
and
secretly
enjoyed
the
drive
unforeseen
though
it
had
been
his
spine
never
said
a
word
perhaps
it
too
enjoyed
having
a
change
from
a
couch
in
a
dark
city
room
they
saw
no
one
in
their
passage
through
the
long
low
old
house
phyllis
evidently
had
learned
that
allan
did
like
his
carryings
about
done
before
people
wallis
seemed
to
be
acting
under
a
series
of
detailed
orders
he
and
arthur
carried
their
master
to
a
long
room
at
the
end
of
the
house
and
deftly
transferred
him
to
a
couch
much
more
convenient
being
newer
than
the
old
one
on
this
he
was
wheeled
to
his
adjoining
bedroom
and
when
wallis
had
made
him
comfortable
there
he
left
him
mysteriously
for
a
while
it
was
growing
dark
by
now
and
the
lights
were
on
they
were
allan
noticed
as
the
others
had
been
at
home
allan
watched
the
details
of
his
room
with
that
vivid
interest
in
little
changes
which
only
invalids
can
know
there
was
an
landscape
story
paper
on
the
walls
with
very
little
repeat
over
it
but
not
where
they
interfered
with
tracing
out
the
adventures
of
the
paper
people
were
a
good
many
pictures
quite
incongruous
for
they
were
of
the
remington
type
men
like
but
pleasant
to
see
nevertheless
the
furniture
was
and
gay
there
was
not
one
thing
in
the
room
to
remind
a
man
that
he
was
an
invalid
it
occurred
to
allan
that
phyllis
must
have
put
a
good
deal
of
deliberate
work
on
the
place
he
lay
contentedly
watching
the
grate
fire
and
trying
to
trace
out
the
story
of
the
paper
for
at
least
a
he
found
himself
at
length
much
to
his
own
surprise
thinking
with
a
certain
longing
of
his
he
was
thinking
of
it
more
and
more
interestedly
by
the
time
wallis
trayless
came
back
and
de
guenther
and
the
young
madam
are
waiting
for
you
in
the
he
announced
they
would
be
glad
if
you
would
have
supper
with
them
very
well
said
allan
amiably
still
much
to
his
own
surprise
the
truth
was
he
was
still
enough
awake
and
interested
to
want
to
go
on
having
things
happen
the
room
wallis
wheeled
him
back
into
was
a
long
low
one
wainscoted
and
it
was
furnished
with
the
best
imitation
chippendale
to
be
obtained
in
a
hurry
but
over
and
above
there
were
cushioned
chairs
and
couches
enough
for
solid
comfort
there
were
more
cheerful
pictures
the
maxfield
parrishes
phyllis
had
wanted
over
the
walls
there
was
a
fire
here
also
the
room
had
no
more
period
than
a
girl
sentence
but
there
was
a
bright
air
of
welcomeness
and
informality
that
was
winning
an
against
the
wall
was
covered
with
a
great
many
picknicky
things
to
eat
another
table
had
more
things
mostly
to
eat
with
on
it
and
there
were
the
de
guenthers
and
phyllis
on
the
whole
it
felt
very
like
a
phyllis
in
a
satiny
gown
he
had
never
seen
before
came
over
to
his
couch
to
meet
him
she
looked
very
apprehensive
and
young
and
wistful
for
the
rôle
of
bold
bad
hypnotist
she
bent
towards
him
with
her
hand
out
seemed
about
to
speak
then
backed
flushed
and
acted
as
if
something
had
frightened
her
badly
is
she
as
afraid
of
me
as
all
that
thought
allan
wallis
must
have
given
her
a
lurid
account
of
how
he
had
behaved
his
quick
impulse
was
to
reassure
her
well
phyllis
my
dear
you
certainly
did
bother
me
with
plans
time
he
said
smiling
this
is
a
bully
surprise
i
i
glad
you
like
it
said
his
wife
shyly
still
backing
away
of
course
he
like
it
said
de
guenther
kind
staccato
voice
behind
him
kiss
your
husband
and
tell
him
he
welcome
home
phyllis
child
now
phyllis
was
tired
with
much
hurried
work
and
overstrung
and
allan
lying
there
smiling
boyishly
up
at
her
allan
seen
for
the
first
time
in
these
gray
was
like
neither
the
marble
crusader
she
had
feared
nor
the
heartbroken
little
boy
she
had
pitied
he
was
suddenly
her
contemporary
a
very
handsome
and
attractive
young
fellow
a
little
her
senior
from
all
appearances
he
might
have
been
well
and
normal
and
come
home
to
her
only
a
little
tired
perhaps
by
the
day
work
or
sport
as
he
lay
smiling
at
her
in
that
friendly
intimate
way
it
was
terrifyingly
different
everything
felt
different
all
her
little
pieces
of
feeling
for
him
pity
and
awe
and
friendliness
and
love
of
service
seemed
to
spring
suddenly
together
and
make
something
else
something
unplaced
and
disturbing
her
cheeks
burned
with
a
childish
embarrassment
as
she
stood
there
before
him
in
her
ruffled
pink
gown
what
should
she
do
it
was
just
then
that
de
guenther
crisply
spoken
advice
came
phyllis
was
one
of
those
people
whose
first
unconscious
instinct
is
to
obey
an
unspoken
order
she
bent
blindly
to
allan
lips
and
kissed
him
with
a
child
obedience
then
straightened
up
aghast
he
would
think
her
very
bold
but
he
did
not
for
some
reason
it
may
have
seemed
only
comforting
and
natural
to
him
that
swift
childish
kiss
and
phyllis
hair
brushing
his
face
men
take
a
great
deal
without
question
as
their
rightful
due
the
others
closed
around
him
then
welcoming
him
laughing
at
the
surprise
and
the
way
he
had
taken
it
telling
him
all
about
it
as
if
everything
were
as
usual
and
pleasant
as
possible
and
the
present
state
of
things
had
always
been
a
pleasant
commonplace
and
wallis
began
to
serve
the
picnic
supper
xi
there
were
trays
and
little
tables
and
the
food
itself
would
have
betrayed
a
southern
darky
in
the
kitchen
if
nothing
else
had
it
was
the
first
meal
allan
had
eaten
with
any
one
for
years
and
he
found
it
so
interesting
as
to
be
almost
exciting
wallis
took
the
plates
invisibly
away
when
they
were
done
and
they
continued
to
stay
in
their
about
the
fire
and
talk
it
all
over
phyllis
tired
to
death
still
had
slid
to
her
favorite
curled
on
cushions
and
leaning
against
the
allan
could
have
touched
her
hair
with
his
hand
she
thought
of
this
curled
there
but
she
was
too
tired
to
move
it
was
exciting
to
be
near
him
somehow
tired
as
she
was
most
of
the
short
evening
was
spent
celebrating
the
fact
that
allan
had
thrown
something
at
wallis
who
was
recalled
to
tell
the
story
three
times
in
detail
then
there
was
the
house
to
discuss
its
good
and
bad
points
its
nearnesses
and
farnesses
let
me
tell
you
allan
said
de
guenther
warmly
at
this
point
from
her
seat
at
the
foot
of
the
couch
this
wife
of
yours
is
a
wonder
not
many
girls
could
have
had
a
house
in
this
condition
two
weeks
after
it
was
bought
allan
looked
down
at
the
heap
of
shining
hair
below
him
all
he
could
see
of
phyllis
yes
he
said
consideringly
she
certainly
is
at
a
certain
slowness
in
his
tone
phyllis
sprang
up
you
must
be
tired
to
she
said
it
must
be
nearly
ten
do
you
feel
worn
out
before
he
could
say
anything
de
guenther
had
also
risen
and
was
sweeping
away
her
husband
of
course
he
is
she
said
decisively
what
have
we
all
been
thinking
of
and
we
must
go
to
bed
too
albert
if
you
insist
on
taking
that
early
train
in
the
morning
and
i
insist
on
going
with
you
children
wallis
had
appeared
by
this
time
and
was
wheeling
allan
from
the
room
before
he
had
a
chance
to
say
much
of
anything
but
the
de
guenthers
talked
a
little
longer
to
phyllis
and
were
gone
also
phyllis
flung
herself
on
the
rugs
and
pillows
before
the
fire
too
tired
to
move
further
well
she
had
everything
that
she
had
wished
for
on
that
wet
february
day
in
the
library
money
leisure
to
be
pretty
a
husband
whom
she
did
have
to
associate
with
much
rest
if
she
ever
gave
herself
leave
to
take
it
and
the
she
had
her
wishes
as
uncannily
fulfilled
as
if
she
had
been
ordering
her
fate
from
a
department
store
and
had
money
to
pay
for
it
and
back
there
in
the
city
it
was
somebody
late
night
and
that
somebody
it
would
be
anna
black
turn
would
it
was
struggling
with
john
zanowskis
and
sadie
rabinowitzes
by
the
lapful
just
as
she
had
and
yet
and
yet
they
had
really
cared
for
her
those
dirty
dear
little
foreigners
of
hers
but
she
had
to
work
for
their
liking
perhaps
perhaps
she
could
make
allan
harrington
like
her
as
much
as
the
children
did
he
had
been
so
kind
about
the
move
and
all
and
so
much
brighter
her
handsome
allan
in
his
gray
if
she
could
stay
brave
enough
and
kind
enough
and
bright
enough
her
eyelids
drooped
wallis
was
standing
respectfully
over
her
harrington
he
was
saying
with
a
really
masterly
ignoring
of
her
attitude
on
the
rug
harrington
says
you
have
bid
him
yet
an
amazing
message
had
she
been
in
the
habit
of
it
that
he
demanded
it
like
a
small
boy
but
she
sprang
up
and
followed
wallis
into
room
he
was
lying
back
in
his
white
silk
sleeping
things
among
the
white
looking
as
he
always
had
before
only
he
seemed
too
alive
and
awake
still
for
his
old
rôle
of
phyllis
he
began
eagerly
as
she
sat
down
beside
him
what
made
you
so
frightened
when
i
first
came
wallis
had
worried
you
had
he
oh
no
it
was
that
at
all
said
phyllis
and
thank
you
for
being
so
generous
about
it
all
i
was
generous
said
her
husband
i
behaved
like
everything
to
old
wallis
about
it
well
what
was
it
then
i
i
only
you
looked
so
different
in
pleaded
phyllis
like
any
man
my
age
or
older
as
if
you
might
get
up
and
go
to
business
or
play
tennis
or
anything
and
and
i
was
of
you
that
all
truly
she
was
sitting
on
the
bed
edge
her
eyes
down
her
hands
quivering
in
her
lap
the
picture
of
a
who
is
quite
sure
whether
been
good
or
not
why
that
sounds
truthful
said
allan
and
laughed
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
heard
him
and
she
gave
a
start
such
a
clear
cheerful
laugh
maybe
he
would
laugh
more
by
and
by
if
she
worked
hard
to
make
him
allan
she
said
are
you
going
to
kiss
me
demanded
this
new
allan
precisely
as
if
she
had
been
doing
it
ever
since
she
met
him
evidently
that
kiss
three
hours
ago
had
created
a
precedent
phyllis
colored
to
her
ears
she
seemed
to
herself
to
be
always
coloring
now
but
she
must
cross
allan
tired
as
he
must
be
allan
she
said
again
sedately
and
kissed
his
cheek
as
she
had
done
a
month
ago
years
ago
when
they
had
been
married
then
she
fled
wallis
said
his
master
dreamily
when
his
man
appeared
again
i
want
some
more
real
clothes
tired
of
get
me
some
please
as
for
phyllis
in
her
little
room
above
him
she
was
crying
comfortably
into
her
pillow
she
had
not
the
faintest
idea
why
except
that
she
liked
doing
it
she
felt
through
her
sleepiness
a
faint
hungry
pleasant
want
of
something
though
she
had
an
idea
what
it
could
be
she
had
everything
except
that
it
was
time
for
the
roses
to
be
out
yet
probably
that
was
the
trouble
roses
she
too
went
to
sleep
how
did
allan
pass
the
night
phyllis
asked
wallis
anxiously
standing
outside
his
door
next
morning
she
had
been
up
since
seven
speeding
the
parting
guests
and
interviewing
the
cook
and
chambermaid
clancy
choice
had
been
cheerful
to
a
degree
and
black
all
of
it
a
fat
virginia
cook
a
slim
young
tuskegee
chambermaid
of
a
pale
and
a
shiny
brown
outdoor
man
who
came
from
nowhere
in
particular
but
was
very
useful
now
he
was
here
phyllis
had
seen
them
all
this
morning
and
found
them
everything
servants
should
be
now
she
was
looking
after
allan
as
her
duty
was
wallis
beamed
from
against
the
his
tray
in
his
hands
harrington
it
one
of
the
best
sleeps
allan
had
four
hours
straight
and
then
sleeping
still
if
broken
till
six
and
still
taking
interest
in
things
oh
you
should
have
heard
him
yesterday
on
the
train
as
furious
as
furious
it
was
beautiful
then
his
spine
was
jarred
said
phyllis
thoughtfully
wallis
i
believe
there
was
more
nervous
shock
and
nervous
depression
than
ever
the
doctors
realized
and
i
believe
all
he
needs
is
to
be
kept
happy
to
be
much
much
better
would
it
be
wonderful
if
he
got
so
he
could
move
freely
from
the
waist
up
i
believe
that
may
happen
if
we
can
keep
him
cheered
and
interested
wallis
looked
down
at
his
tray
yes
he
said
not
to
speak
ill
of
the
dead
harrington
the
late
harrington
was
always
saying
poor
stricken
boy
and
things
like
that
not
jar
him
with
light
or
merriment
and
reminding
him
how
bad
he
was
and
she
certainly
did
jar
him
with
any
merriment
what
were
the
doctors
thinking
about
demanded
phyllis
indignantly
well
they
did
all
sorts
of
things
to
poor
allan
for
the
first
year
or
so
and
then
as
nothing
helped
and
they
could
find
out
what
was
wrong
to
have
paralyzed
him
so
he
begged
to
have
them
stopped
hurting
him
so
we
have
had
one
for
the
past
five
years
i
think
a
masseur
and
a
are
the
next
things
to
get
said
phyllis
decisively
and
remember
wallis
there
something
the
matter
with
allan
shutters
they
wo
always
close
the
sunshine
out
as
they
should
wallis
almost
winked
if
an
elderly
servitor
can
be
imagined
as
winking
no
he
promised
something
wrong
with
i
remember
phyllis
went
singing
on
down
the
sunny
old
house
swinging
her
colored
muslin
skirts
and
prancing
a
little
with
sheer
joy
of
being
and
prettily
dressed
with
a
dear
house
all
her
own
and
yes
a
dear
allan
a
little
her
own
too
doing
well
for
a
man
what
another
woman
has
done
badly
has
a
perennial
joy
for
a
certain
type
of
woman
and
this
was
what
phyllis
was
in
the
very
midst
of
she
pranced
a
little
more
and
came
almost
straight
up
against
a
long
old
mirror
with
gilt
cornices
which
had
come
with
the
house
and
was
staying
with
it
phyllis
stopped
and
looked
critically
at
herself
i
have
taken
time
yet
to
be
pretty
she
reminded
the
girl
in
the
glass
and
began
then
and
there
to
take
account
of
stock
by
way
of
beginning
why
a
good
deal
had
done
itself
her
hair
had
been
washed
and
sunned
and
sunned
and
washed
about
every
ten
minutes
since
she
had
been
away
from
the
library
it
was
springy
and
three
shades
more
golden
she
had
not
been
rushing
out
in
all
weathers
unveiled
nor
washing
hastily
with
hard
water
and
cheap
library
soap
eight
or
ten
times
a
day
because
private
houses
are
comparatively
clean
places
so
her
complexion
had
been
getting
back
unnoticed
a
good
deal
of
its
original
country
with
a
little
gold
glow
underneath
and
the
tired
heaviness
was
gone
from
her
eyelids
because
she
had
scarcely
used
her
eyes
since
she
had
married
allan
there
had
been
too
much
else
to
do
the
little
between
the
brows
had
gone
too
with
the
need
of
and
work
under
electricity
she
was
more
rounded
and
her
look
was
less
intent
the
strained
liberry
teacher
look
was
gone
the
luminous
long
blue
eyes
in
the
glass
looked
back
at
her
girlishly
would
you
think
we
were
even
they
said
phyllis
smiled
irrepressibly
at
the
mirrored
girl
yas
said
the
rich
and
comfortable
voice
of
the
cook
from
the
door
you
sholy
is
pretty
yas
a
lady
to
stay
pretty
when
she
married
yo
don
look
much
a
bride
an
dat
a
fac
does
you
want
yo
dinnehs
brought
into
de
regular
till
de
gits
well
yes
no
yes
for
the
present
any
way
said
phyllis
with
a
mixture
of
confusion
and
dignity
fortunately
the
doorbell
chose
this
time
to
ring
a
young
messenger
with
a
rocking
crate
wanted
to
speak
to
the
madam
the
last
item
on
phyllis
shopping
list
had
come
the
wolfhound
doing
fine
the
messenger
answered
in
response
to
her
questions
like
a
different
dog
already
all
he
needed
was
exercise
and
a
little
society
yes
this
pup
broken
in
a
manner
that
is
your
man
picked
you
out
the
little
feller
in
the
litter
here
foxy
careful
lady
hold
on
to
his
leash
there
was
the
passage
of
the
check
a
few
directions
about
and
then
the
messenger
from
the
kennels
drove
back
to
the
station
the
crate
which
had
been
emptied
of
a
wriggling
black
on
the
seat
beside
him
xii
allan
lying
at
the
window
of
the
sunny
bedroom
and
wondering
if
they
had
been
having
springs
like
this
all
the
time
he
had
lived
in
the
city
heard
a
scuffle
outside
the
door
his
wife
voice
inquired
breathlessly
of
wallis
can
allan
see
me
oh
gracious
foxy
you
little
black
gargoyle
open
the
door
or
shut
it
quick
wallis
but
the
door
owing
to
circumstances
over
which
nobody
but
the
black
dog
had
any
control
flew
violently
open
here
and
allan
had
a
flying
vision
of
his
wife
flushed
laughing
and
badly
mussed
being
railroaded
across
the
room
by
a
prancingly
exuberant
french
bull
at
the
end
of
a
leash
he
he
a
cheerful
dog
panted
phyllis
trying
to
bring
foxy
to
anchor
near
allan
and
i
do
think
he
knows
how
to
keep
still
long
enough
to
pose
across
your
feet
he
would
become
them
anyhow
he
a
real
allan
not
an
interior
decoration
oh
wallis
he
has
allan
slipper
foxy
you
little
fraud
did
him
want
a
drink
did
you
get
him
for
me
phyllis
asked
allan
when
the
tumult
and
the
shouting
had
died
and
the
caracoling
foxy
had
buried
his
hideous
little
black
in
a
costly
belleek
dish
of
water
yes
gasped
phyllis
from
her
favorite
seat
the
floor
but
you
need
keep
him
unless
you
want
to
i
can
keep
him
where
you
never
see
him
ca
i
only
i
thought
he
be
company
for
you
and
do
you
think
he
seems
cheerful
allan
threw
his
picturesque
head
back
on
the
cushions
and
laughed
and
laughed
cheerful
he
said
most
assuredly
why
thank
you
ever
so
much
phyllis
you
an
awfully
thoughtful
girl
i
always
did
like
bulls
had
one
in
college
a
nelson
come
here
you
little
rascal
he
whistled
and
the
puppy
lifted
its
muzzle
from
the
water
made
a
dripping
dash
to
the
couch
and
scrambled
up
over
allan
as
if
they
had
owned
each
other
since
birth
never
was
a
dog
less
weighed
down
by
the
glories
of
ancestry
allan
pulled
the
flopping
with
his
most
useful
hand
and
asked
with
interest
why
on
earth
did
they
call
a
french
bull
foxy
yes
sir
said
wallis
i
understand
sir
that
he
was
the
most
active
and
playful
of
the
litter
and
chewed
up
all
his
brothers
ears
sir
and
the
kennel
people
thought
it
was
so
clever
that
they
called
him
foxy
the
dog
in
the
litter
cried
phyllis
bursting
into
helpless
laughter
from
the
floor
that
does
mean
he
explained
master
and
man
eagerly
together
phyllis
began
to
see
that
she
had
bought
a
family
pet
as
much
for
wallis
as
for
allan
she
left
them
adoring
the
dog
with
that
reverent
emotion
which
only
very
ugly
can
wake
in
a
breast
and
flitted
out
happy
over
the
success
of
her
new
toy
for
allan
take
him
out
when
he
gets
too
much
for
allan
she
managed
to
say
softly
to
wallis
as
she
passed
him
but
except
for
a
run
or
so
for
his
health
wallis
and
allan
between
them
kept
the
dog
in
the
bedroom
most
of
the
day
phyllis
in
one
of
her
flying
visits
found
the
little
fellow
tired
with
play
and
other
attentions
snuggled
down
by
his
master
his
little
crumpled
black
muzzle
on
the
pillow
close
to
allan
contented
sleeping
face
she
felt
as
if
she
wanted
to
cry
the
pathetic
lack
of
interests
which
made
the
coming
of
a
new
little
dog
such
an
event
before
she
hung
one
more
picture
before
she
set
up
even
a
book
from
the
boxes
which
had
been
her
father
before
she
arranged
one
more
article
of
furniture
she
telephoned
to
the
village
for
the
regular
delivery
of
four
daily
papers
and
a
of
the
most
masculine
magazines
she
could
think
of
on
the
library
lists
she
had
never
known
of
doing
any
reading
that
he
had
cared
for
books
before
the
accident
she
knew
at
any
rate
she
was
resolved
to
leave
no
point
uncovered
that
might
just
possibly
help
her
allan
just
a
little
way
to
interest
in
life
which
she
felt
to
be
the
way
to
recovery
he
liked
being
told
stories
to
any
way
do
you
think
allan
will
feel
like
coming
into
the
she
asked
wallis
meeting
him
in
the
hall
about
two
why
he
dressed
was
wallis
astonishing
reply
and
him
and
the
pup
is
having
a
fine
game
of
play
he
got
more
use
of
that
hand
an
arm
than
we
thought
do
you
think
he
care
to
be
wheeled
into
the
about
four
asked
phyllis
for
tea
inquired
wallis
beaming
i
should
think
so
i
ask
anyhow
phyllis
had
not
thought
of
tea
one
does
not
stop
for
such
leisurely
amenities
in
a
busy
public
library
but
she
saw
the
beauty
of
the
idea
and
saw
to
it
that
the
tea
was
there
was
a
jewel
she
built
the
fire
up
to
a
bright
flame
and
brought
in
some
daffodils
from
the
garden
without
a
word
from
her
mistress
phyllis
herself
saw
that
the
victrola
was
in
readiness
and
cleared
a
space
for
the
couch
near
the
fire
there
was
quite
a
festal
feeling
the
was
also
a
surprise
for
allan
phyllis
thought
afterward
that
she
should
have
saved
it
for
another
day
but
the
temptation
to
grace
the
occasion
with
it
was
too
strong
she
and
allan
were
as
excited
over
it
as
a
couple
of
children
and
the
only
drawback
to
allan
enjoyment
was
that
he
obviously
wanted
to
take
the
records
out
of
her
unaccustomed
fingers
and
adjust
them
himself
he
knew
how
it
appeared
and
phyllis
naturally
did
however
she
managed
to
follow
his
directions
successfully
she
had
bought
recklessly
of
discs
and
provided
a
fair
amount
of
opera
selections
allan
seemed
equally
happy
over
both
after
the
thing
had
been
playing
for
of
an
hour
and
most
of
the
records
were
exhausted
phyllis
rang
for
tea
it
was
getting
a
little
darker
now
and
the
cast
fantastic
red
and
black
lights
and
shadows
over
the
room
it
was
very
intimate
and
thrilling
to
phyllis
suddenly
the
room
with
just
their
two
selves
there
allan
on
his
couch
before
the
fire
looked
bright
and
contented
the
adjustable
had
been
braced
to
such
a
position
that
he
was
almost
sitting
up
the
who
had
lately
come
back
from
a
long
walk
with
the
gratified
outdoor
man
snored
regularly
on
the
rug
near
his
master
wakening
enough
to
bat
his
tail
on
the
floor
if
he
was
referred
to
the
little
was
between
allan
and
phyllis
crowned
with
a
bunch
of
whose
scent
dominated
the
warm
room
phyllis
in
her
green
gown
her
cheeks
pink
with
excitement
was
waiting
on
her
lord
and
master
a
little
silently
allan
watched
her
amusedly
for
awhile
she
was
as
intent
as
a
good
child
over
her
and
her
lemon
and
her
little
cakes
say
something
phyllis
he
suggested
with
the
touch
of
mischief
she
was
not
yet
used
to
coming
from
him
this
is
a
serious
matter
she
replied
gravely
do
you
know
i
made
tea
afternoon
tea
that
is
for
so
long
it
a
wonder
i
know
which
is
the
cup
and
which
is
the
saucer
why
not
he
asked
idly
yet
interestedly
too
i
was
otherwise
occupied
i
was
a
daughter
of
toil
explained
phyllis
serenely
setting
down
her
own
cup
to
relax
in
her
chair
hands
behind
her
head
looking
in
her
green
gown
the
picture
of
graceful
strong
young
indolence
i
was
a
librarian
did
you
know
no
i
wish
you
tell
me
if
you
do
mind
said
allan
about
you
i
mean
phyllis
do
you
know
i
feel
awfully
married
to
you
this
afternoon
you
bullied
me
so
much
it
no
wonder
and
i
really
ought
to
know
about
my
wife
dark
past
phyllis
heart
beat
a
little
faster
she
too
had
felt
awfully
married
here
alone
in
the
dealing
so
intimately
and
gayly
with
allan
there
is
much
to
tell
she
said
soberly
come
over
here
closer
commanded
allan
the
spoilt
we
both
had
all
the
tea
we
want
come
close
by
the
couch
i
want
to
see
you
when
you
talk
phyllis
did
as
he
ordered
i
was
a
new
england
country
minister
daughter
she
began
new
england
country
ministers
always
know
lots
about
greek
and
latin
and
how
to
make
one
dollar
do
the
work
of
but
they
never
have
any
dollars
left
when
the
doing
over
father
and
i
lived
alone
together
always
and
he
taught
me
things
and
i
petted
him
fathers
need
it
specially
when
they
have
country
congregations
and
we
did
bother
much
about
other
folks
then
he
died
i
was
eighteen
and
i
had
six
hundred
dollars
i
could
do
arithmetic
because
father
had
always
said
it
was
left
out
of
my
head
and
i
need
bother
with
it
so
i
could
teach
then
they
said
like
books
and
you
better
be
a
librarian
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
librarian
never
gets
a
chance
to
read
but
you
ca
explain
that
to
the
general
public
so
i
came
to
the
city
and
took
the
course
at
library
school
then
i
got
a
position
in
the
greenway
branch
two
years
in
the
circulating
desk
four
in
the
cataloguing
room
and
one
in
the
children
department
the
short
and
simple
annals
of
the
poor
go
on
said
allan
i
believe
it
merely
that
you
like
the
sound
of
the
human
voice
said
phyllis
laughing
i
going
to
go
on
with
the
story
of
the
five
little
pigs
you
enjoy
it
just
as
much
exactly
said
allan
tell
me
what
it
was
like
in
the
library
please
it
was
rather
interesting
said
phyllis
yielding
at
once
there
are
so
many
different
things
to
be
done
that
you
never
feel
any
monotony
as
i
suppose
a
teacher
does
but
the
hours
are
not
much
shorter
than
a
department
store
and
it
exacting
work
all
the
time
i
liked
the
work
with
the
children
best
only
you
never
have
any
time
to
be
anything
but
neat
in
a
library
and
you
do
get
so
tired
of
being
just
neat
if
you
a
girl
and
a
pretty
one
said
allan
i
do
suppose
the
ugly
ones
mind
as
much
it
was
the
first
thing
he
had
said
about
her
looks
phyllis
ready
color
came
into
her
cheeks
so
he
thought
she
was
pretty
do
you
think
i
pretty
she
asked
breathlessly
she
could
help
it
of
course
i
do
you
little
goose
said
allan
smiling
at
her
phyllis
plunged
back
into
the
middle
of
her
story
you
see
you
ca
sit
up
nights
to
sew
much
or
practise
doing
your
hair
new
ways
because
you
need
all
your
strength
to
get
up
when
the
barks
next
morning
and
then
there
always
the
if
you
have
nothing
but
your
salary
of
course
this
last
year
when
i
been
getting
fifty
dollars
a
month
things
have
been
all
right
but
when
it
was
only
thirty
a
month
in
the
circulation
well
that
was
pretty
hard
pulling
said
phyllis
thoughtfully
but
the
worst
the
worst
allan
was
waking
up
nights
and
wondering
what
would
happen
if
you
broke
down
for
a
long
time
because
you
very
well
save
for
on
even
fifty
a
month
and
the
work
well
of
course
most
girls
work
is
just
a
little
more
than
they
have
the
strength
for
always
but
i
was
awfully
lucky
to
get
into
work
some
of
my
imps
little
poles
and
slovaks
and
hungarians
mostly
are
the
cleverest
most
affectionate
babies
she
began
to
tell
him
stories
of
wonderful
who
were
socialists
by
conviction
and
read
economics
and
dazed
little
atypical
who
read
mother
goose
and
stopped
even
that
because
they
got
married
you
poor
little
girl
said
allan
unheeding
what
brutes
they
were
to
you
well
thank
heaven
that
over
now
why
allan
she
said
laying
a
soothing
hand
on
his
nobody
was
a
brute
there
never
more
than
one
in
any
library
they
say
ours
was
the
supervisor
of
the
left
half
of
the
desk
and
after
i
got
out
of
circulation
i
never
saw
anything
of
her
allan
burst
into
unexpected
laughter
it
sounds
like
a
chinese
title
of
honor
he
explained
warder
of
the
emperor
left
or
something
of
the
sort
the
desk
where
you
get
your
books
stamped
she
explained
and
the
two
shifts
of
girls
who
attend
to
that
part
of
the
work
each
have
a
supervisor
the
right
and
left
halves
the
one
that
was
horrid
had
favorites
and
snapped
at
the
ones
that
were
i
was
under
her
though
my
supervisor
was
lovely
an
irishwoman
with
the
most
florid
hats
and
the
kindest
most
just
disposition
and
always
laughing
we
all
adored
her
she
was
so
you
think
a
good
deal
about
laughing
said
allan
thoughtfully
does
it
rank
as
a
virtue
in
libraries
or
what
you
have
to
laugh
explained
phyllis
if
you
do
see
the
of
things
you
see
the
and
you
ca
afford
to
be
unhappy
if
you
have
to
earn
your
living
people
like
brightness
best
and
it
more
comfortable
for
yourself
once
you
get
used
to
it
so
that
was
your
philosophy
of
life
said
allan
his
hand
tightened
compassionately
on
hers
you
little
girl
tell
me
about
the
phyllis
his
voice
was
very
moved
and
caressing
and
the
darkness
was
deepening
as
the
fire
sank
only
an
occasional
tongue
of
flame
glinted
across
phyllis
silver
and
on
the
allan
wore
it
was
easy
to
tell
things
there
in
the
perfumed
duskiness
it
was
a
great
many
years
since
any
one
had
cared
to
hear
the
and
it
was
so
dark
and
the
hand
keeping
hers
in
the
shadows
might
have
been
any
kind
comforting
hand
she
found
herself
pouring
it
all
out
to
allan
there
close
by
her
the
loneliness
the
strain
the
hard
work
the
lack
of
all
the
in
her
life
the
isolation
and
dreariness
at
night
the
and
the
hurt
of
watching
youth
and
womanhood
sliding
away
unused
with
nothing
to
show
for
all
the
years
only
a
cold
hope
that
her
flock
of
little
transient
aliens
might
be
a
little
better
for
the
guidance
she
could
give
them
years
hence
in
rustic
speech
a
phrase
as
in
rude
earth
a
grecian
vase
and
then
that
wet
discouraged
day
in
february
and
the
vision
of
eva
atkinson
radiantly
fresh
and
happy
kept
young
and
pretty
by
unlimited
money
and
time
her
children
were
so
pretty
said
phyllis
wistfully
and
mine
dear
little
villains
were
such
dirty
untaught
rude
little
things
oh
it
sounds
snobbish
but
i
have
given
everything
i
had
to
have
a
dainty
clean
little
throw
her
arms
around
me
and
kiss
me
instead
of
my
pet
little
handsome
sticky
polish
jewess
up
at
home
everything
had
been
so
clean
and
old
and
still
that
you
always
could
remember
it
had
been
finished
for
three
hundred
years
and
father
clean
still
old
library
phyllis
did
not
know
how
she
was
revealing
to
allan
the
unconscious
motherhood
in
her
but
allan
femininely
sensitive
to
unspoken
things
from
his
long
sojourn
in
the
dark
allan
did
it
was
the
that
she
was
spending
on
him
but
of
a
kind
he
had
never
known
before
gayly
efficient
shown
only
in
its
results
and
she
could
never
have
anything
else
to
spend
it
on
he
thought
well
he
was
due
to
die
in
a
few
years
but
he
did
want
to
living
was
just
beginning
to
be
interesting
again
somehow
there
seemed
no
satisfactory
solution
for
the
two
of
them
well
he
be
unselfish
and
die
any
way
meanwhile
why
not
be
happy
here
was
phyllis
his
hand
clasped
hers
more
closely
and
when
de
guenther
made
me
that
offer
she
murmured
coloring
in
the
darkness
i
was
tired
and
discouraged
and
the
years
seemed
so
endless
it
did
seem
as
though
i
be
harming
any
one
but
i
have
done
it
if
you
said
a
word
against
it
truly
i
would
dear
the
last
little
word
slipped
out
unnoticed
she
had
been
calling
her
library
children
dear
for
a
year
now
and
the
word
slipped
out
of
itself
but
allan
liked
it
my
poor
little
girl
he
said
in
your
place
i
have
married
the
devil
himself
up
against
a
life
like
that
then
then
you
do
mind
asked
phyllis
anxiously
as
she
had
asked
before
no
indeed
said
allan
with
a
little
unnecessary
firmness
i
you
that
did
i
i
like
it
so
you
did
tell
me
she
said
penitently
but
supposing
de
guenther
had
picked
out
some
one
like
you
that
just
what
i
often
thought
myself
said
phyllis
naively
she
might
have
been
much
worse
than
i
oh
but
i
was
frightened
when
i
saw
you
first
i
did
know
what
you
be
like
and
then
when
i
looked
at
you
well
when
you
looked
at
me
demanded
allan
but
phyllis
refused
to
go
on
but
that
not
all
said
allan
what
about
men
what
men
asked
phyllis
innocently
why
men
you
were
interested
in
of
course
he
answered
there
were
any
said
phyllis
i
had
any
place
to
meet
them
or
anywhere
to
entertain
them
if
i
had
met
them
oh
yes
there
was
one
an
old
bookkeeper
at
the
all
the
boarders
there
were
old
that
was
why
the
people
at
home
had
chosen
it
they
thought
it
would
be
safe
it
was
all
of
that
well
the
bookkeeper
demanded
allan
you
straying
off
from
your
narrative
the
bookkeeper
phyllis
my
dear
i
telling
you
about
him
protested
phyllis
he
was
awfully
cross
because
i
would
marry
him
but
i
did
see
any
reason
why
i
should
i
did
like
him
especially
and
i
would
probably
have
gone
on
with
my
work
afterwards
there
did
seem
to
me
to
be
anything
to
it
for
any
one
but
him
for
of
course
i
have
had
his
mending
and
all
that
to
do
when
i
came
home
from
the
library
and
i
scarcely
got
time
for
my
own
but
he
lost
his
temper
fearfully
because
i
did
want
to
then
of
course
men
would
try
to
flirt
in
the
library
but
the
janitor
always
made
them
go
out
when
you
asked
him
to
he
loved
doing
it
why
allan
it
must
be
seven
shall
i
turn
on
more
lights
no
then
you
were
quite
as
shut
up
in
your
noisy
library
as
i
was
in
my
dark
rooms
said
allan
musingly
i
suppose
i
was
she
said
though
i
never
thought
of
it
before
you
must
think
it
was
horrid
it
was
fun
lots
of
it
only
there
any
being
a
real
girl
in
it
there
is
much
in
this
i
should
think
said
allan
savagely
except
looking
after
a
big
doll
phyllis
laugh
tinkled
out
oh
i
playing
with
dolls
she
said
mischievously
and
you
ought
to
see
my
new
slippers
i
have
pink
ones
and
blue
ones
and
lavender
and
green
all
satin
and
suede
and
when
i
get
time
i
going
to
buy
dresses
to
match
and
a
banjo
maybe
with
a
there
a
room
upstairs
where
nobody
can
hear
a
thing
you
do
i
wanted
slippers
and
a
banjo
ever
since
i
can
remember
then
you
fairly
happy
demanded
allan
suddenly
why
of
course
said
phyllis
though
she
had
not
really
stopped
to
ask
herself
before
whether
she
was
or
not
there
had
been
so
many
exciting
things
to
do
would
you
be
happy
if
you
could
buy
everything
you
wanted
and
every
one
was
lovely
to
you
and
you
had
pretty
clothes
and
a
lovely
house
and
a
yes
if
i
could
buy
everything
i
wanted
said
allan
his
voice
dragged
a
little
phyllis
sprang
up
instantly
penitent
you
tired
and
i
been
talking
and
talking
about
my
silly
little
woes
till
i
worn
you
out
she
said
but
allan
you
getting
better
try
to
move
this
arm
the
hand
i
holding
there
that
a
lot
more
than
you
could
do
when
i
first
came
i
think
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
plan
for
a
masseur
to
come
down
and
see
it
now
look
here
phyllis
protested
allan
i
like
your
taste
in
houses
and
and
but
i
be
hanged
if
i
stand
for
a
masseur
there
no
use
they
ca
do
me
any
good
and
the
last
one
almost
killed
me
there
no
reason
why
i
should
be
tormented
simply
because
a
professional
pounder
needs
the
money
no
no
said
phyllis
not
that
kind
wallis
can
have
orders
to
shoot
him
or
something
if
he
touches
your
spinal
column
all
i
meant
was
a
man
who
would
give
the
muscles
of
your
arms
and
shoulders
a
little
exercise
that
could
hurt
and
might
help
you
use
them
that
would
be
any
trouble
would
it
the
first
minute
he
hurts
you
can
send
him
flying
you
know
they
call
massage
lazy
people
exercise
i
believe
you
really
interested
in
making
me
better
said
allan
after
a
long
silence
why
of
course
said
phyllis
laughing
that
what
i
here
for
but
this
answer
did
not
seem
to
suit
allan
for
some
reason
phyllis
said
no
more
about
the
masseur
she
only
decided
to
summon
him
any
way
and
presently
wallis
came
in
and
turned
all
the
lights
on
xiii
in
due
course
of
time
june
came
so
did
the
masseur
and
more
flowered
frocks
for
phyllis
and
the
for
allan
the
immediate
effect
of
june
was
to
bring
out
buds
all
over
the
of
the
flowered
dresses
to
make
phyllis
very
picturesquely
pretty
as
for
the
masseur
he
had
more
effect
than
anything
else
it
was
as
phyllis
had
hoped
the
paralysis
of
allan
arms
had
been
less
permanent
than
any
one
had
thought
and
for
perhaps
the
last
three
years
there
had
been
little
more
the
matter
than
entire
loss
of
strength
and
from
long
disuse
by
the
time
they
had
been
a
month
in
the
country
allan
use
of
his
arms
and
shoulders
was
nearly
normal
and
phyllis
was
having
wild
hopes
that
she
confided
to
no
one
but
wallis
of
even
more
sweeping
betterments
allan
slept
much
better
from
the
slight
increase
of
activity
and
also
perhaps
because
phyllis
had
coaxed
him
outdoors
as
soon
as
the
weather
became
warm
and
was
keeping
him
there
sometimes
he
lay
in
the
garden
on
his
couch
sometimes
he
sat
up
in
the
almost
always
with
phyllis
sitting
or
lying
in
her
hammock
near
him
and
the
devoted
foxy
pretending
to
hunt
something
near
by
there
were
occasional
fits
of
the
old
depression
and
silence
when
allan
would
lie
silently
in
his
own
room
with
his
hands
crossed
and
his
eyes
shut
answering
no
one
not
even
foxy
wallis
and
phyllis
respected
these
moods
and
left
him
alone
till
they
were
over
but
the
adoring
foxy
had
no
such
delicacy
of
feeling
and
it
is
hard
to
remain
silently
sunk
in
depression
when
an
active
small
dog
is
imploring
you
by
every
means
he
knows
to
throw
balls
for
him
to
run
after
for
the
rest
allan
proved
to
have
naturally
a
lighter
heart
and
more
carefree
disposition
than
phyllis
his
natural
disposition
was
buoyant
wallis
said
that
he
had
never
had
a
mood
in
his
life
till
the
accident
his
attitude
to
his
wife
became
more
and
more
a
affection
and
dependence
it
is
to
be
feared
that
phyllis
spoiled
him
badly
but
it
was
so
long
since
she
had
been
needed
by
any
one
person
as
allan
needed
her
and
he
had
such
lovable
illogical
masculine
ways
of
being
wronged
if
he
did
get
the
requisite
amount
of
petting
and
grateful
for
foolish
little
favors
and
taking
big
ones
for
granted
that
entirely
as
phyllis
insisted
to
herself
from
a
sense
of
combined
duty
and
grateful
interest
she
would
have
had
her
pretty
head
removed
and
sent
him
by
if
he
had
idly
suggested
his
possible
need
of
a
girl
head
some
time
and
it
was
so
heavenly
oh
but
it
was
heavenly
there
in
with
the
colored
flowers
coming
out
and
the
little
green
caterpillars
roaming
over
the
leaves
and
pretty
dresses
to
wear
and
to
play
with
and
allan
allan
demanded
no
not
exactly
demanded
but
expected
and
got
so
much
of
phyllis
society
in
these
days
that
she
had
learned
to
carry
on
all
her
affairs
even
the
housekeeping
out
in
her
hammock
by
his
or
couch
she
wore
large
floppy
white
hats
with
roses
on
them
by
way
of
keeping
the
sun
off
but
allan
it
appeared
did
not
think
much
of
hats
except
as
an
ornament
for
girls
and
his
uncovered
curly
hair
was
burned
to
a
sort
of
all
through
and
his
pallor
turned
to
a
clear
pale
brown
phyllis
looked
up
from
her
work
one
of
these
heavenly
days
and
tried
to
decide
whether
she
really
liked
the
change
or
not
allan
was
handsomer
unquestionably
though
that
had
hardly
been
necessary
but
the
resignedly
statuesque
look
was
gone
allan
felt
her
look
and
looked
up
at
her
he
had
been
reading
a
magazine
for
phyllis
had
succeeded
in
a
large
measure
in
reviving
his
taste
for
magazines
and
books
well
phyllis
my
dear
said
he
smiling
what
the
problem
now
i
feel
sure
there
is
something
new
going
to
be
sprung
on
me
get
the
worst
over
you
wrong
me
she
said
beginning
to
thread
some
more
pink
embroidery
silk
i
was
only
wondering
whether
i
liked
you
as
well
tanned
as
i
did
when
you
were
so
nice
and
white
back
in
the
city
cheerful
thought
said
allan
laying
down
his
magazine
entirely
shall
i
ring
for
wallis
and
some
peroxide
as
you
said
the
other
day
have
to
be
approved
of
or
i
unhappy
oh
it
really
does
matter
said
phyllis
mischievously
you
know
i
married
you
principally
for
a
and
that
i
suppose
i
spoil
the
perspective
said
allan
unexpectedly
ruffled
phyllis
leaned
forward
in
her
draperies
and
stroked
his
hand
that
long
carven
hand
she
so
loved
to
watch
not
a
bit
allan
she
said
laughing
at
him
you
exceedingly
decorative
i
remember
the
first
time
i
saw
you
i
thought
you
looked
exactly
like
a
marble
knight
on
a
tomb
allan
allan
the
listless
tranced
invalid
of
four
months
before
threw
his
head
back
and
shouted
with
laughter
i
suppose
i
serve
the
purpose
of
garden
statuary
he
said
we
used
to
have
some
horrors
when
i
was
a
kid
i
remember
two
awful
bronze
deer
that
always
looked
as
if
they
were
trying
not
to
get
their
feet
wet
and
a
floppy
bronze
dog
we
called
fido
he
was
meant
for
a
gordon
setter
i
think
but
it
did
go
much
further
than
intention
louise
and
i
used
to
ride
the
deer
his
face
shadowed
a
little
as
he
spoke
for
nearly
the
first
time
of
the
dead
girl
allan
phyllis
said
bending
closer
to
him
all
rosy
and
golden
in
her
green
hammock
tell
me
about
louise
frey
if
you
do
mind
talking
about
her
would
it
be
bad
for
you
do
you
think
allan
eyes
dwelt
on
his
wife
pleasurably
she
was
very
real
and
near
and
lovable
and
louise
frey
seemed
far
away
and
shadowy
in
his
thoughts
he
had
loved
her
very
dearly
and
passionately
that
boisterous
handsome
young
louise
but
that
gay
she
had
belonged
to
seemed
separated
now
from
this
pleasant
with
its
young
chatelaine
by
thousands
of
black
years
the
blackness
came
back
when
he
remembered
what
lay
behind
it
there
nothing
much
to
tell
phyllis
he
said
frowning
a
little
she
was
pretty
and
full
of
life
she
had
black
hair
and
eyes
and
a
good
deal
of
color
we
were
more
or
less
friends
all
our
lives
for
our
adjoined
she
was
eighteen
when
it
happened
eighteen
said
phyllis
musingly
she
would
have
been
just
my
age
we
wo
talk
about
it
then
allan
well
viola
the
pretty
tuskegee
chambermaid
was
holding
out
a
tray
with
a
card
on
it
the
doctor
she
said
the
doctor
echoed
allan
i
you
had
something
up
your
sleeve
phyllis
what
on
earth
did
you
have
him
for
phyllis
face
was
a
study
of
astonishment
on
my
honor
i
had
a
notion
he
was
even
in
existence
she
protested
he
not
doctor
he
must
have
growed
or
else
called
him
in
suggested
allan
sunnily
bring
him
along
viola
viola
produced
him
so
promptly
that
nobody
had
time
to
remember
the
professional
doctor
visits
do
usually
have
cards
or
thought
to
look
at
the
card
for
enlightenment
so
the
surprise
was
complete
when
the
doctor
appeared
johnny
hewitt
ejaculated
allan
throwing
out
both
hands
in
greeting
of
all
people
well
you
old
fraud
pretending
to
be
a
doctor
the
last
i
heard
about
you
you
were
trying
to
prove
that
you
were
the
man
that
tied
a
mule
into
old
sumerley
chair
at
college
i
never
did
prove
it
responded
johnny
hewitt
shaking
hands
vigorously
but
the
fellows
said
afterwards
that
i
ought
to
apologize
to
the
mule
he
was
a
perfectly
good
mule
but
i
a
doctor
all
right
i
live
here
in
wallraven
i
wondered
if
it
might
be
you
by
any
chance
allan
when
i
heard
some
harringtons
had
bought
here
but
this
is
the
first
chance
a
promising
young
chickenpox
epidemic
has
given
me
to
find
out
it
what
left
of
me
said
allan
smiling
ruefully
and
phyllis
this
turns
out
to
be
an
old
friend
of
mine
this
is
harrington
johnny
oh
i
so
glad
beamed
phyllis
springing
up
from
her
hammock
and
looking
as
if
she
loved
johnny
here
was
exactly
what
was
needed
somebody
for
allan
to
play
with
she
made
herself
delightful
to
the
newcomer
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
excused
herself
they
would
have
a
better
time
alone
for
awhile
any
way
and
there
was
dinner
to
order
maybe
this
johnny
would
stay
for
dinner
he
should
if
she
could
make
him
she
sang
a
little
on
her
way
to
the
house
and
almost
forgot
the
tiny
hurt
it
had
been
when
allan
seemed
so
saddened
by
speaking
of
louise
frey
she
had
no
right
to
feel
hurt
she
knew
it
was
only
to
be
expected
that
allan
would
always
love
louise
memory
she
did
know
much
about
men
but
that
was
the
way
it
always
was
in
stories
a
man
heart
would
die
under
an
automobile
or
anywhere
else
and
all
there
was
left
for
anybody
else
was
leavings
it
was
fair
and
then
phyllis
threw
back
her
shoulders
and
laughed
as
she
had
sometimes
in
the
library
days
and
reminded
herself
what
a
nice
world
it
was
any
way
and
that
allan
was
going
to
be
much
helped
by
johnny
hewitt
that
was
a
cheering
thought
anyhow
she
went
on
singing
and
ordered
a
beautiful
dinner
a
very
poem
of
gratitude
then
she
pounced
on
the
doctor
as
he
was
leaving
and
made
him
stay
for
it
allan
eyes
were
bright
and
his
face
lighted
with
interest
phyllis
at
the
head
of
the
table
kept
just
enough
in
the
talk
to
push
the
men
on
when
it
seemed
flagging
which
was
not
often
she
learned
more
about
allan
and
incidentally
johnny
hewitt
in
the
talk
as
they
lingered
about
the
table
than
she
had
ever
known
before
she
and
allan
had
lived
so
deliberately
in
the
placid
present
with
its
almost
childish
brightnesses
and
interests
that
she
knew
scarcely
more
about
her
husband
life
than
the
de
guenthers
had
told
her
before
she
married
him
but
she
could
see
the
whole
picture
of
it
as
she
listened
now
the
active
merry
brilliant
boy
who
had
worked
and
played
all
day
and
danced
half
the
night
who
had
lived
it
almost
seemed
to
her
two
or
three
lives
in
one
and
then
the
change
to
the
darkened
room
helpless
unable
to
move
with
the
added
sorrow
of
his
sweetheart
death
and
his
mother
deliberate
fostering
of
that
sorrow
it
was
almost
a
shock
to
see
him
in
the
at
the
foot
of
the
table
his
face
lighted
with
interest
in
what
he
and
his
friend
were
saying
what
if
he
did
care
for
louise
frey
memory
still
he
had
such
a
hard
time
that
anything
phyllis
could
do
for
him
ought
to
be
too
much
when
hewitt
went
at
last
phyllis
accompanied
him
to
the
door
she
kept
him
there
for
a
few
minutes
talking
to
him
about
allan
and
making
him
promise
to
come
often
he
agreed
with
her
that
this
much
progress
made
a
good
deal
more
might
follow
he
promised
to
come
back
very
soon
and
see
as
much
of
them
as
possible
allan
watching
them
out
of
earshot
from
the
where
he
had
been
wheeled
saw
phyllis
smiling
warmly
up
at
his
friend
lingering
in
talk
with
him
giving
him
both
hands
in
farewell
and
he
saw
too
hewitt
rapt
interest
and
long
at
last
the
door
closed
and
phyllis
came
back
to
him
flushed
and
animated
he
realized
watching
her
return
with
that
swift
lightness
of
foot
her
long
years
of
work
had
lent
her
how
young
and
strong
and
lovely
she
was
with
the
in
her
cheeks
and
the
light
from
above
making
her
hair
glitter
and
suddenly
her
slim
young
strength
and
her
bright
vitality
seemed
to
mock
him
instead
of
being
a
comfort
and
support
as
heretofore
a
young
beautiful
kind
girl
like
that
it
was
natural
she
should
like
hewitt
and
it
was
going
to
come
natural
to
hewitt
to
like
phyllis
he
could
see
that
plainly
enough
tired
allan
harrington
she
asked
brightly
coming
over
to
him
and
dropping
a
light
hand
on
his
chair
in
a
caressing
little
way
she
had
dared
lately
kindness
yes
she
was
the
incarnation
of
kindness
doubtless
she
had
spoken
to
and
touched
those
little
ragamuffins
she
had
told
him
of
just
so
he
had
got
into
a
habit
of
feeling
that
phyllis
belonged
to
him
absolutely
he
had
forgotten
what
was
it
she
had
said
to
him
that
afternoon
half
in
fun
but
oh
doubtless
half
in
earnest
about
marrying
him
for
a
she
had
done
just
that
she
had
never
made
any
secret
of
it
why
how
could
she
marrying
him
before
she
had
spoken
a
words
to
him
but
how
wonderful
she
had
been
to
him
since
sometimes
almost
as
if
she
cared
for
him
he
moved
ungraciously
do
me
phyllis
he
said
irritably
wallis
you
can
wheel
me
into
my
room
said
phyllis
behind
him
the
little
forlorn
sound
hurt
him
but
it
pleased
him
too
so
he
could
hurt
her
if
only
by
rudeness
well
that
was
a
satisfaction
shut
the
door
he
ordered
wallis
swiftly
phyllis
her
hands
at
her
throat
stood
hurt
and
frightened
in
the
middle
of
the
room
it
never
occurred
to
her
that
allan
was
jealous
or
indeed
that
he
could
care
enough
for
her
to
be
jealous
it
was
talking
about
louise
frey
she
said
that
and
hewitt
bringing
up
old
times
oh
did
i
ask
about
her
he
was
contented
i
know
he
was
contented
he
gotten
to
like
having
me
with
him
he
even
wanted
me
oh
allan
allan
she
did
not
want
to
cry
downstairs
so
she
ran
for
her
own
room
there
she
threw
herself
down
and
cried
into
a
pillow
till
most
of
the
case
was
wet
she
was
silly
she
knew
she
was
silly
she
tried
to
think
of
all
the
things
that
were
still
hers
the
garden
the
the
leisure
the
pretty
gowns
but
nothing
seemed
of
any
consequence
beside
the
fact
that
she
had
not
kissed
allan
it
seemed
the
most
intolerable
thing
that
had
ever
happened
to
her
xiv
it
was
just
as
well
perhaps
that
phyllis
did
not
do
much
sleeping
that
night
for
at
about
two
wallis
knocked
at
her
door
it
seemed
like
history
repeating
itself
when
he
said
could
you
come
to
allan
please
he
seems
very
bad
she
threw
on
the
silk
crepe
negligee
and
followed
him
just
as
she
had
done
before
on
that
night
after
her
had
died
did
hewitt
visit
overexcite
him
do
you
think
he
asked
as
they
went
i
do
know
wallis
said
he
almost
as
bad
as
he
was
after
the
old
madam
died
you
remember
oh
yes
said
phyllis
mechanically
i
remember
allan
lay
so
exactly
as
he
had
on
that
other
night
that
the
strange
surroundings
seemed
incongruous
just
the
same
except
that
his
restlessness
was
more
visible
because
he
had
more
power
of
motion
she
bent
and
held
the
nervously
clenching
hands
as
she
had
before
what
is
it
allan
she
said
soothingly
nothing
said
her
husband
savagely
nerves
hysteria
any
other
silly
womanish
thing
a
cripple
could
have
let
me
alone
phyllis
i
wish
you
could
put
me
out
of
the
way
altogether
phyllis
made
herself
laugh
though
her
heart
hurried
with
fright
she
had
seen
allan
suffer
badly
before
be
apathetic
irritable
despondent
but
never
in
a
state
where
he
did
not
cling
to
her
i
ca
let
you
alone
she
said
brightly
i
come
to
stay
with
you
till
you
feel
quieter
would
you
rather
i
talked
to
you
or
kept
quiet
oh
do
your
wifely
duty
whatever
it
is
he
said
it
was
a
mistake
the
whole
thing
you
done
more
than
your
duty
child
but
oh
you
better
go
away
phyllis
heart
turned
over
was
it
as
bad
as
this
was
he
as
sick
of
her
as
this
you
mean
you
think
she
faltered
it
was
a
mistake
our
marriage
yes
he
said
restlessly
yes
it
was
fair
she
had
no
means
of
knowing
that
he
meant
it
was
unfair
to
her
she
held
on
to
herself
though
she
felt
her
face
turning
cold
with
the
sudden
pallor
of
fright
i
think
it
can
be
annulled
she
said
steadily
no
i
suppose
it
was
fair
she
stopped
to
get
her
breath
and
catch
at
the
only
things
that
mattered
steadiness
quietness
ability
to
soothe
allan
it
can
be
annulled
she
said
again
evenly
but
listen
to
me
now
allan
it
will
take
quite
a
while
it
ca
be
done
or
before
you
are
stronger
so
for
your
own
sake
you
must
try
to
rest
now
everything
shall
come
right
i
promise
you
it
shall
be
annulled
but
forget
it
now
please
i
am
going
to
hold
your
wrists
and
talk
to
you
recite
things
for
you
till
you
go
back
to
sleep
she
wondered
afterwards
how
she
could
have
spoken
with
that
hard
serenity
how
she
could
have
gone
steadily
on
with
story
after
story
poem
after
poem
till
allan
grip
on
her
hands
relaxed
and
he
fell
into
a
heavy
tired
sleep
illustration
but
you
see
he
all
i
have
wallis
she
sat
on
the
side
of
the
bed
and
looked
at
him
lying
still
against
his
white
pillows
she
looked
and
looked
and
presently
the
tears
began
to
slide
silently
down
her
cheeks
she
did
not
lift
her
hands
to
wipe
them
away
she
sat
and
cried
silently
openly
like
a
desolate
unkindly
treated
child
allan
allan
came
wallis
concerned
whisper
from
the
doorway
do
take
it
as
hard
as
that
it
just
a
little
relapse
he
was
overtired
i
should
have
called
you
but
you
always
quiet
him
so
phyllis
brushed
off
her
tears
and
smiled
you
seemed
to
have
to
do
so
much
smiling
in
this
house
i
know
she
said
i
worry
about
his
condition
too
much
but
you
see
he
all
i
have
wallis
once
out
of
allan
room
she
ran
at
full
speed
till
she
gained
her
own
bed
where
she
could
cry
in
peace
till
morning
if
she
wanted
to
with
no
one
to
interrupt
that
was
all
right
the
trouble
was
going
to
be
next
morning
but
somehow
when
morning
came
the
old
routine
was
dragged
through
with
directions
had
to
be
given
the
servants
as
usual
allan
comfort
and
amusement
seen
to
just
as
if
nothing
had
happened
it
was
a
perfect
day
golden
and
perfumed
with
just
that
little
tang
of
fresh
windiness
that
june
days
have
in
the
northern
states
and
allan
must
not
lose
it
he
must
be
wheeled
out
into
the
garden
she
came
out
to
him
in
the
place
where
they
usually
sat
and
sank
for
a
moment
in
the
hammock
that
afternoon
she
had
avoided
him
all
the
morning
i
just
came
to
see
if
everything
was
all
right
she
said
leaning
toward
him
in
that
childlike
earnest
way
he
knew
so
well
i
do
need
to
stay
here
if
i
worry
you
i
rather
you
stay
if
you
do
mind
he
answered
phyllis
looked
at
him
intently
he
was
white
and
dispirited
and
his
voice
was
listless
oh
phyllis
thought
if
louise
frey
had
only
been
kind
enough
to
die
in
babyhood
instead
of
under
allan
automobile
what
could
there
have
been
about
her
to
hold
allan
so
long
she
glanced
at
his
weary
face
again
this
would
never
do
what
had
come
to
be
her
dominant
instinct
keeping
allan
spirits
up
emboldened
her
to
bend
forward
and
even
laugh
a
little
come
allan
she
said
even
if
we
not
going
to
stay
together
always
we
might
as
well
be
cheerful
till
we
do
part
we
used
to
be
good
friends
enough
ca
we
be
so
a
little
longer
it
sounded
heartless
to
her
after
she
had
said
it
but
it
seemed
the
only
way
to
speak
she
smiled
at
him
bravely
allan
looked
at
her
mutely
for
a
moment
as
if
she
had
hurt
him
you
right
he
said
suddenly
there
no
time
but
the
present
after
all
come
over
here
closer
to
me
phyllis
you
been
awfully
good
to
me
child
is
there
anything
i
could
do
for
you
something
you
could
remember
afterwards
and
say
he
did
that
for
me
any
way
phyllis
eyes
filled
with
tears
you
have
given
me
everything
already
she
said
catching
her
breath
she
did
feel
as
if
she
could
stand
much
more
of
this
everything
he
said
bitterly
no
i
have
i
ca
give
you
what
every
girl
wants
a
well
strong
man
to
be
her
husband
the
health
and
strength
that
any
man
in
the
street
has
oh
do
speak
that
way
allan
she
bent
over
him
sympathetically
moved
by
his
words
in
another
moment
the
misunderstanding
might
have
been
straightened
out
if
it
had
not
been
for
his
reply
i
wish
i
never
had
to
see
you
at
all
he
said
involuntarily
in
her
sensitive
state
of
mind
the
hurt
was
all
she
felt
not
the
deeper
meaning
that
lay
behind
the
words
i
relieve
you
of
my
presence
for
awhile
she
flashed
back
before
she
gave
herself
time
to
think
she
had
left
the
garden
with
something
which
might
be
called
a
flounce
when
people
say
things
like
that
to
you
she
said
as
she
walked
away
from
him
it
carrying
being
an
invalid
a
little
far
allan
heard
the
slam
he
had
never
suspected
before
that
phyllis
had
a
temper
and
yet
what
could
he
have
said
but
she
gave
him
no
opportunity
to
find
out
in
just
about
the
time
it
might
take
to
find
gloves
and
a
parasol
another
door
clanged
in
the
distance
the
street
door
phyllis
had
evidently
gone
out
phyllis
on
her
swift
way
down
the
street
grew
angrier
and
angrier
she
tried
to
persuade
herself
to
make
allowances
for
allan
but
they
refused
to
be
made
she
felt
more
bitterly
toward
him
than
she
ever
had
toward
any
one
in
her
life
if
she
only
had
leaned
over
him
and
been
sorry
for
him
just
before
she
got
a
slap
in
the
face
like
that
she
walked
rapidly
down
the
main
street
of
the
little
village
she
hardly
knew
where
she
was
going
she
had
been
called
on
by
most
of
the
local
people
but
she
did
not
feel
like
being
agreeable
or
making
formal
calls
just
now
and
what
was
the
use
of
making
friends
any
way
when
she
was
going
back
to
her
rags
poor
little
cinderella
that
she
was
below
and
around
and
above
everything
else
came
the
stinging
thought
that
she
had
given
allan
so
much
that
she
had
taken
so
much
for
granted
her
quick
steps
finally
took
her
to
the
outskirts
of
the
village
to
a
little
green
stretch
of
woods
there
she
walked
up
and
down
for
awhile
trying
to
think
more
quietly
she
found
the
tide
of
her
anger
ebbing
suddenly
and
her
mind
forming
all
sorts
of
excuses
for
allan
but
that
was
not
the
way
to
get
quiet
thinking
of
allan
she
tried
to
put
him
resolutely
from
her
mind
and
think
about
her
own
future
plans
the
first
thing
to
do
she
decided
was
to
rub
up
her
library
work
a
little
it
was
with
an
unexpected
feeling
of
having
returned
to
her
own
place
that
she
crossed
the
marble
floor
of
the
village
library
she
felt
as
if
she
ought
to
hurry
down
to
the
instead
of
waiting
leisurely
at
the
desk
for
her
card
it
all
seemed
uncannily
like
home
there
was
even
a
girl
inside
the
desk
who
looked
like
anna
black
of
her
own
greenway
branch
phyllis
could
hear
with
a
faint
amusement
that
the
girl
was
scolding
energetically
in
anna
black
own
way
the
words
struck
on
her
quick
ears
though
they
were
not
intended
to
carry
that
what
comes
of
trusting
to
volunteer
help
telephones
at
the
last
moment
has
a
headache
and
not
a
single
soul
to
look
after
the
and
the
children
are
almost
all
here
already
we
just
have
to
send
them
home
said
the
other
girl
looking
up
from
her
trayful
of
cards
it
too
late
to
get
anybody
else
and
goodness
knows
ca
get
it
in
they
ought
to
have
another
librarian
fretted
the
girl
who
looked
like
anna
they
could
afford
it
well
enough
with
their
soldiers
monuments
and
all
phyllis
smiled
to
herself
from
where
she
was
investigating
the
it
all
sounded
so
exceedingly
natural
then
that
swift
instinct
of
hers
to
help
caught
her
over
to
the
desk
and
she
heard
herself
saying
i
had
some
experience
in
story
telling
maybe
i
could
help
you
with
the
i
could
help
hearing
that
your
has
disappointed
you
the
girl
like
anna
fell
on
her
with
rapture
heaven
must
have
sent
you
she
said
the
other
one
evidently
slower
and
more
cautious
by
nature
rose
too
and
came
toward
her
you
have
a
card
here
have
you
she
said
i
think
i
seen
you
yes
phyllis
said
with
a
pang
at
speaking
the
name
she
had
grown
to
love
bearing
i
harrington
phyllis
harrington
we
live
at
the
other
end
of
the
village
oh
in
the
house
with
the
garden
all
shut
off
from
the
lane
said
the
girl
like
anna
delightedly
that
lovely
old
house
that
used
to
belong
to
the
jamesons
oh
yes
i
know
you
here
for
the
summer
you
and
your
husband
has
been
very
ill
exactly
said
phyllis
smiling
though
she
wished
people
would
talk
about
allan
they
seemed
possessed
to
mention
him
we
be
obliged
forever
if
you
do
it
said
the
other
girl
evidently
the
head
librarian
can
you
do
it
now
the
children
are
waiting
certainly
said
phyllis
and
followed
the
younger
girl
straightway
to
the
basement
where
it
seemed
the
was
held
she
wondered
as
they
went
if
the
girl
envied
her
her
expensively
perishable
summer
organdie
with
its
flying
sashes
and
costly
accessories
if
the
girl
thought
about
her
swinging
jewelries
and
endless
leisure
with
a
wish
to
have
them
for
herself
she
had
wanted
such
things
she
knew
when
she
was
being
happy
on
fifty
dollars
a
month
and
perhaps
some
of
the
women
she
had
watched
then
had
had
heartaches
under
their
furs
the
children
already
sitting
in
a
decorous
ring
on
their
low
chairs
seemed
after
the
first
surprise
to
approve
of
phyllis
the
librarian
lingered
for
a
little
by
way
of
keeping
order
if
it
should
be
necessary
watched
the
competent
sweep
with
which
phyllis
gathered
the
children
around
her
heard
the
opening
of
the
story
and
left
with
an
air
of
astonished
approval
phyllis
late
best
of
the
greenway
branch
watched
her
go
with
a
bit
of
professional
triumph
in
her
heart
she
told
the
children
stories
till
the
time
was
up
and
then
just
one
story
more
she
had
not
forgotten
how
she
found
but
she
never
told
them
the
story
of
how
the
elephant
got
his
trunk
that
foolish
fascinating
classic
that
she
had
told
allan
the
night
his
mother
had
died
the
story
that
had
sent
him
to
sleep
quietly
for
the
first
time
in
years
oh
dear
was
everything
in
the
world
connected
with
allan
in
some
way
or
other
it
was
nearly
six
when
she
went
up
engulfed
in
children
to
the
circulating
room
there
the
caught
her
she
had
evidently
been
told
to
try
to
get
phyllis
for
more
for
she
did
her
best
to
make
her
promise
they
talked
shop
together
for
perhaps
an
hour
and
a
half
then
the
growing
twilight
reminded
phyllis
that
it
was
time
to
go
back
she
had
been
shirking
going
home
she
realized
now
all
the
afternoon
she
said
to
the
and
went
on
down
the
village
street
lagging
unconsciously
it
must
have
been
about
eight
by
this
time
it
was
a
mile
back
to
the
house
she
could
have
taken
the
trolley
part
of
the
way
but
she
felt
restless
and
like
walking
she
had
forgotten
that
walking
at
night
through
city
streets
and
going
in
through
country
byways
were
two
different
things
she
was
destined
to
be
reminded
of
the
difference
can
you
help
a
poor
man
lady
said
a
whining
voice
behind
her
when
she
had
a
quarter
of
the
way
yet
to
go
she
turned
to
see
a
big
tramp
a
terrifying
brute
with
a
look
on
his
heavy
unshaven
face
she
was
desperately
frightened
she
had
been
spoken
to
once
or
twice
in
the
city
but
there
there
was
always
a
policeman
or
a
house
you
could
run
into
if
you
had
to
but
here
in
the
unguarded
dusk
of
a
country
lane
it
was
a
different
matter
the
long
gold
chain
that
swung
below
her
waist
the
big
diamond
on
her
finger
the
gold
all
the
jewelry
she
took
such
a
childlike
delight
in
wearing
she
remembered
them
in
terror
she
was
no
little
now
to
slip
along
disregarded
and
the
tramp
did
not
look
like
a
deserving
object
if
you
will
come
to
the
house
she
said
hurrying
on
as
she
spoke
i
have
some
work
for
you
the
first
house
on
this
street
that
you
come
to
she
did
not
dare
give
him
anything
or
send
him
away
wo
you
gim
me
somethin
now
lady
whined
the
tramp
continuing
to
follow
i
a
starvin
man
she
dared
not
open
her
purse
and
appease
him
by
giving
him
money
she
had
too
much
with
her
that
morning
she
had
received
the
check
for
her
monthly
income
from
de
guenther
sent
wallis
down
to
cash
it
and
then
stuffed
it
in
her
bag
and
forgotten
it
in
the
distress
of
the
day
the
man
might
take
the
money
and
strike
her
senseless
even
kill
her
she
said
going
rapidly
on
she
had
now
what
would
amount
to
about
three
city
blocks
to
traverse
still
there
was
a
short
way
from
outside
the
through
to
the
garden
which
cut
off
about
a
if
she
could
gain
this
she
would
be
safe
naw
yeh
do
snarled
the
tramp
as
she
fled
on
ye
set
that
o
yours
on
me
i
been
there
an
come
away
again
you
just
gim
me
some
o
them
rings
an
things
an
we
call
it
square
me
fine
lady
phyllis
heart
stood
still
at
this
open
menace
but
she
ran
on
still
a
sudden
thought
came
to
her
she
snatched
her
gilt
a
pretty
thing
but
of
small
value
from
her
waist
and
hurled
it
far
behind
the
tramp
in
the
it
might
have
been
her
gold
there
my
money
go
get
it
she
gasped
and
ran
for
her
life
the
tramp
as
she
had
hoped
he
would
dashed
back
after
it
and
gave
her
the
start
she
needed
breathless
terrified
to
death
she
raced
on
tearing
her
frock
dropping
the
library
cards
and
parasol
she
still
had
held
in
her
hand
once
she
caught
her
sash
on
a
once
her
caught
and
nearly
threw
her
the
chase
seemed
unending
she
could
hear
the
dreadful
footsteps
of
the
tramp
behind
her
and
his
snarling
swearing
voice
panting
out
threats
he
was
drunk
she
realized
with
another
thrill
of
horror
it
was
a
nightmare
happening
on
and
on
she
stumbled
fell
caught
herself
but
the
tramp
had
gained
then
at
last
the
almost
invisible
gap
in
the
hedge
and
she
fled
through
allan
allan
she
screamed
fleeing
instinctively
to
his
chair
the
was
like
a
place
of
enchanted
peace
after
the
terror
of
outside
her
quick
vision
as
she
rushed
in
was
of
allan
still
there
moveless
in
his
chair
with
the
little
black
lying
asleep
across
his
arms
and
shoulder
like
a
child
it
often
lay
so
as
she
entered
the
scene
broke
up
before
her
eyes
like
a
dissolving
view
she
saw
the
little
dog
wake
and
make
what
seemed
one
flying
spring
to
the
tramp
throat
and
sink
his
teeth
in
it
and
allan
at
her
scream
from
his
phyllis
forgot
everything
at
the
sight
of
allan
standing
wallis
and
the
outdoor
man
who
had
run
to
the
spot
at
phyllis
screams
were
dealing
with
the
tramp
who
was
writhing
on
the
grass
choking
and
striking
out
wildly
but
neither
phyllis
nor
allan
saw
that
which
caught
the
other
in
an
embrace
they
never
knew
they
stood
locked
together
forgetting
everything
else
he
in
the
idea
of
her
peril
she
in
the
wonder
of
his
standing
oh
darling
darling
allan
was
saying
over
and
over
again
you
are
safe
thank
heaven
you
are
safe
oh
phyllis
i
could
never
forgive
myself
if
you
had
been
hurt
phyllis
speak
to
me
but
phyllis
own
safety
did
not
concern
her
now
she
could
only
think
of
one
thing
can
stand
you
can
stand
she
reiterated
then
a
wonderful
thought
came
to
her
striking
across
the
others
as
she
stood
locked
in
this
miraculously
raised
allan
arms
she
spoke
without
knowing
that
she
had
said
it
aloud
you
care
too
she
said
very
low
then
the
dominant
thought
returned
you
must
sit
down
again
she
said
hurriedly
to
cover
her
confusion
and
what
she
had
said
please
allan
sit
down
please
dear
you
tire
yourself
allan
sank
into
his
chair
again
still
holding
her
she
dropped
on
her
knees
beside
him
with
her
arms
around
him
she
had
a
little
leisure
now
to
observe
that
wallis
the
had
tied
the
tramp
neatly
with
the
outdoor
man
suspenders
which
were
nearer
the
surface
than
his
own
and
succeeded
in
prying
off
the
still
unappeased
foxy
who
evidently
was
wronged
at
not
having
the
tramp
to
finish
they
carried
him
off
into
the
back
kitchen
garden
allan
now
that
he
was
certain
of
phyllis
safety
paid
them
not
the
least
attention
did
you
mean
it
he
said
passionately
tell
me
did
you
mean
what
you
said
phyllis
dropped
her
dishevelled
head
on
allan
shoulder
i
afraid
i
going
to
cry
and
and
i
know
you
do
like
it
she
panted
allan
half
drew
half
guided
her
up
into
his
arms
was
it
true
he
insisted
giving
her
an
impulsive
little
shake
she
sat
up
on
his
knees
and
like
a
child
but
you
knew
that
all
along
she
said
that
was
why
i
felt
so
humiliated
it
was
that
thought
did
care
allan
laughed
joyously
care
he
said
i
should
think
i
did
first
last
and
all
the
time
why
phyllis
child
did
i
behave
like
a
brute
because
i
was
jealous
enough
of
john
hewitt
to
throw
him
in
the
river
he
was
the
first
man
you
had
seen
since
you
married
me
attractive
and
well
and
clever
and
all
that
it
would
have
been
natural
enough
if
you
liked
him
liked
him
said
phyllis
in
disdain
when
there
was
you
and
i
thought
i
thought
it
was
the
memory
of
louise
frey
that
made
you
act
that
way
you
did
want
to
talk
about
her
and
you
said
it
was
all
a
mistake
i
was
a
brute
said
allan
again
it
was
the
memory
that
i
was
about
as
useful
as
a
rag
doll
and
that
the
world
was
full
of
live
men
with
real
legs
and
arms
ready
to
fall
in
love
with
you
there
nobody
but
in
the
world
whispered
phyllis
but
you
well
now
or
you
will
be
soon
she
added
joyously
she
slipped
away
from
him
allan
do
you
want
to
try
to
stand
again
if
you
did
it
then
you
can
do
it
now
yes
by
jove
i
do
he
said
but
this
time
the
effort
to
rise
was
noticeable
still
he
could
do
it
with
phyllis
eager
help
it
must
have
been
what
hewitt
called
neurasthenic
inhibition
said
phyllis
watching
the
miracle
of
a
standing
allan
that
was
what
we
were
talking
about
by
the
door
that
night
you
foolish
boy
oh
how
tall
you
are
i
never
realized
you
were
tall
lying
down
somehow
i
do
have
to
bend
very
far
to
kiss
you
though
suggested
allan
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
but
phyllis
when
this
was
satisfactorily
concluded
went
back
to
the
great
business
of
seeing
how
much
allan
could
walk
he
sat
down
again
after
a
steps
a
little
tired
in
spite
of
his
excitement
i
ca
do
much
at
a
time
yet
i
suppose
he
said
a
little
ruefully
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
sweetheart
come
over
here
closer
where
i
can
touch
you
you
awfully
far
away
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
all
that
ailed
me
was
i
thought
i
could
move
oh
no
explained
phyllis
moving
her
chair
close
and
then
as
that
did
not
seem
satisfactory
perching
on
the
arm
of
allan
you
been
unable
to
move
for
so
long
that
when
you
were
able
to
at
last
your
subconscious
mind
clamped
down
on
your
muscles
and
was
convinced
you
could
so
no
matter
how
much
you
consciously
tried
you
could
make
the
muscles
go
till
you
were
so
strongly
excited
it
broke
the
inhibition
just
as
people
can
lift
things
in
delirium
or
excitement
that
they
could
possibly
move
at
other
times
do
you
see
i
do
said
allan
kissing
the
back
of
her
neck
irrelevantly
if
somebody
tried
to
shoot
me
up
five
years
ago
i
might
be
a
well
man
now
that
a
beautiful
word
of
yours
phyllis
inhibition
what
a
lot
of
big
words
you
know
oh
if
you
wo
be
serious
said
she
we
have
to
be
said
allan
laughing
for
here
wallis
and
as
i
live
from
the
direction
of
the
house
i
thought
they
carried
our
friend
the
tramp
out
through
the
hedge
he
must
have
gone
all
the
way
around
phyllis
was
secretly
certain
that
wallis
had
been
crying
a
little
but
all
he
said
was
we
taken
the
tramp
to
the
sir
but
his
master
and
his
mistress
were
not
so
dignified
they
showed
him
exhaustively
that
allan
could
really
stand
and
walk
and
allan
demonstrated
it
and
wallis
nearly
cried
again
then
they
went
in
for
phyllis
was
sure
allan
needed
a
thorough
rest
after
all
this
she
was
shaking
from
head
to
foot
herself
with
joyful
excitement
but
she
did
not
even
know
it
and
it
was
long
past
though
every
one
but
to
whom
the
happy
news
had
somehow
filtered
had
forgotten
it
i
always
wanted
to
hold
you
in
my
arms
this
way
said
allan
late
that
evening
as
they
stood
in
the
again
but
i
thought
i
never
would
phyllis
did
you
ever
want
me
to
it
was
too
beautiful
a
moonlight
night
to
waste
in
the
house
or
even
on
the
porch
the
couch
had
been
wheeled
to
its
accustomed
place
in
the
and
allan
was
supposed
to
be
lying
on
it
as
he
often
did
in
the
evenings
but
it
was
hard
to
make
him
stay
there
oh
you
lie
down
said
phyllis
hurriedly
trying
to
move
out
of
the
circle
of
his
arms
you
must
stand
till
we
find
how
much
is
enough
i
going
to
send
for
the
wolfhound
next
week
you
wo
mind
him
now
will
you
did
you
ever
want
to
be
here
in
my
arms
phyllis
of
course
not
said
phyllis
as
a
modest
young
person
should
but
but
well
my
wife
i
often
wondered
just
where
i
reach
to
said
phyllis
in
a
rush
allan
do
stand
any
longer
i
lie
down
if
you
sit
on
the
couch
by
me
very
well
said
phyllis
and
sat
obediently
in
the
curve
of
his
arm
when
he
had
settled
himself
in
the
old
position
the
one
that
looked
so
much
more
natural
for
him
mine
every
bit
of
you
he
said
exultantly
heaven
bless
that
tramp
and
to
think
we
were
talking
about
annulments
do
you
remember
that
first
night
dear
after
mother
died
i
was
with
grief
and
physical
pain
and
wallis
went
after
you
i
did
want
him
to
but
he
trusted
you
from
the
first
good
old
wallis
and
you
came
in
with
that
swift
sweeping
step
of
yours
as
i
seen
you
come
fifty
times
since
it
seemed
to
me
then
with
all
your
pretty
hair
loose
and
an
angelic
sort
of
a
white
thing
on
i
expect
i
was
a
brute
to
you
i
do
remember
how
i
acted
but
i
know
you
sat
on
the
bed
by
me
and
took
both
my
wrists
in
those
strong
little
hands
of
yours
and
talked
to
me
and
quieted
me
till
i
fell
fast
asleep
you
gave
me
the
first
consecutive
sleep
i
had
in
four
months
it
felt
as
if
life
and
calmness
and
strength
were
pouring
from
you
to
me
you
stayed
till
i
fell
asleep
i
remember
said
phyllis
softly
she
laid
her
cheek
by
his
as
it
had
been
on
that
strange
marriage
evening
that
seemed
so
far
away
now
i
was
afraid
of
you
at
first
but
i
felt
that
too
as
if
i
were
giving
you
my
strength
i
was
so
glad
i
could
and
then
i
fell
asleep
too
over
on
your
shoulder
you
never
told
me
that
said
allan
reproachfully
phyllis
laughed
a
little
there
never
seemed
to
be
any
point
in
our
conversations
where
it
fitted
in
neatly
she
said
demurely
allan
laughed
too
you
should
have
made
one
but
what
i
was
going
to
tell
you
was
i
think
i
began
to
be
in
love
with
you
then
i
did
know
it
but
i
did
and
it
got
worse
and
worse
but
i
did
know
what
ailed
me
till
johnny
drifted
in
bless
his
heart
then
i
did
oh
phyllis
it
was
awful
to
have
you
with
me
all
the
time
acting
like
an
angel
waiting
on
me
hand
and
foot
and
not
knowing
whether
you
had
any
use
for
me
or
not
and
you
never
kissed
me
last
night
phyllis
did
not
answer
she
only
bent
a
little
and
kissed
her
husband
on
the
lips
very
sweetly
and
simply
of
her
own
accord
but
she
said
nothing
then
of
the
long
restless
time
when
she
had
loved
him
and
never
even
hoped
he
would
care
for
her
there
was
time
for
all
that
there
were
going
to
be
long
joyous
years
together
years
of
being
a
real
woman
as
she
had
so
passionately
wished
to
be
that
day
in
the
library
she
would
never
again
need
to
envy
any
woman
happiness
or
love
or
laughter
it
was
all
before
her
now
youth
and
joy
and
love
and
allan
her
allan
soon
to
be
well
and
loving
her
loving
nobody
else
but
her
oh
i
love
you
allan
was
all
she
said
