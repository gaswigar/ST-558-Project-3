john
buchan
to
caroline
grosvenor
during
the
past
year
in
the
intervals
of
an
active
life
i
have
amused
myself
with
constructing
this
tale
it
has
been
scribbled
in
every
kind
of
odd
place
and
moment
in
england
and
abroad
during
long
journeys
in
between
graver
tasks
and
it
bears
i
fear
the
mark
of
its
gipsy
begetting
but
it
has
amused
me
to
write
and
i
shall
be
well
repaid
if
it
amuses
you
and
a
few
others
to
read
let
no
man
or
woman
call
its
events
improbable
the
war
has
driven
that
word
from
our
vocabulary
and
melodrama
has
become
the
prosiest
realism
things
unimagined
before
happen
daily
to
our
friends
by
sea
and
land
the
one
chance
in
a
thousand
is
habitually
taken
and
as
often
as
not
succeeds
coincidence
like
some
new
briareus
stretches
a
hundred
long
arms
hourly
across
the
earth
some
day
when
the
full
history
is
written
sober
history
with
ample
documents
the
poor
romancer
will
give
up
business
and
fall
to
reading
miss
austen
in
a
hermitage
the
characters
of
the
tale
if
you
think
hard
you
will
recall
sandy
you
know
well
that
great
spirit
was
last
heard
of
at
basra
where
he
occupies
the
post
that
once
was
harry
bullivant
richard
hannay
is
where
he
longed
to
be
commanding
his
battalion
on
the
ugliest
bit
of
front
in
the
west
mr
john
blenkiron
full
of
honour
and
wholly
cured
of
dyspepsia
has
returned
to
the
states
after
vainly
endeavouring
to
take
peter

him
as
for
peter

has
attained
the
height
of
his
ambition

has
shaved
his

chapter
one
a
mission
is
proposed
i
had
just
finished
breakfast
and
was
filling
my
pipe
when
i
got
bullivant
telegram
it
was
at
furling
the
big
country
house
in
hampshire
where
i
had
come
to
convalesce
after
loos
and
sandy
who
was
in
the
same
case
was
hunting
for
the
marmalade
i
flung
him
the
flimsy
with
the
blue
strip
pasted
down
on
it
and
he
whistled
dick
you
got
the
battalion
or
maybe
it
a
staff
billet
you
be
a
blighted
coming
it
heavy
over
the
regimental
officer
and
to
think
of
the
language
you
wasted
on
in
your
time
i
sat
and
thought
for
a
bit
for
the
name
carried
me
back
eighteen
months
to
the
hot
summer
before
the
war
i
had
not
seen
the
man
since
though
i
had
read
about
him
in
the
papers
for
more
than
a
year
i
had
been
a
busy
battalion
officer
with
no
other
thought
than
to
hammer
a
lot
of
raw
stuff
into
good
soldiers
i
had
succeeded
pretty
well
and
there
was
no
prouder
man
on
earth
than
richard
hannay
when
he
took
his
lennox
highlanders
over
the
parapets
on
that
glorious
and
bloody
day
of
september
loos
was
no
picnic
and
we
had
had
some
ugly
bits
of
scrapping
before
that
but
the
worst
bit
of
the
campaign
i
had
seen
was
a
to
the
show
i
had
been
in
with
bullivant
before
the
war
started
major
hannay
narrative
of
this
affair
has
been
published
under
the
title
of
the
sight
of
his
name
on
a
telegram
form
seemed
to
change
all
my
outlook
on
life
i
had
been
hoping
for
the
command
of
the
battalion
and
looking
forward
to
being
in
at
the
finish
with
brother
boche
but
this
message
jerked
my
thoughts
on
to
a
new
road
there
might
be
other
things
in
the
war
than
straightforward
fighting
why
on
earth
should
the
foreign
office
want
to
see
an
obscure
major
of
the
new
army
and
want
to
see
him
in
time
going
up
to
town
by
the
ten
train
i
announced
be
back
in
time
for
dinner
my
tailor
said
sandy
got
a
very
nice
taste
in
red
tabs
you
can
use
my
name
an
idea
struck
me
pretty
well
all
right
now
if
i
wire
for
you
will
you
pack
your
own
kit
and
mine
and
join
me
i
accept
a
job
on
your
staff
if
they
give
you
a
corps
if
so
be
as
you
come
down
tonight
be
a
good
chap
and
bring
a
barrel
of
oysters
from
sweeting
i
travelled
up
to
london
in
a
regular
november
drizzle
which
cleared
up
about
wimbledon
to
watery
sunshine
i
never
could
stand
london
during
the
war
it
seemed
to
have
lost
its
bearings
and
broken
out
into
all
manner
of
badges
and
uniforms
which
did
not
fit
in
with
my
notion
of
it
one
felt
the
war
more
in
its
streets
than
in
the
field
or
rather
one
felt
the
confusion
of
war
without
feeling
the
purpose
i
dare
say
it
was
all
right
but
since
august
i
never
spent
a
day
in
town
without
coming
home
depressed
to
my
boots
i
took
a
taxi
and
drove
straight
to
the
foreign
office
sir
walter
did
not
keep
me
waiting
long
but
when
his
secretary
took
me
to
his
room
i
would
not
have
recognized
the
man
i
had
known
eighteen
months
before
his
big
frame
seemed
to
have
dropped
flesh
and
there
was
a
stoop
in
the
square
shoulders
his
face
had
lost
its
rosiness
and
was
red
in
patches
like
that
of
a
man
who
gets
too
little
fresh
air
his
hair
was
much
greyer
and
very
thin
about
the
temples
and
there
were
lines
of
overwork
below
the
eyes
but
the
eyes
were
the
same
as
before
keen
and
kindly
and
shrewd
and
there
was
no
change
in
the
firm
set
of
the
jaw
must
on
no
account
be
disturbed
for
the
next
hour
he
told
his
secretary
when
the
young
man
had
gone
he
went
across
to
both
doors
and
turned
the
keys
in
them
major
hannay
he
said
flinging
himself
into
a
chair
beside
the
fire
do
you
like
soldiering
enough
i
said
this
is
just
the
kind
of
war
i
would
have
picked
myself
it
a
comfortless
bloody
business
but
got
the
measure
of
the
old
boche
now
and
it
dogged
as
does
it
i
count
on
getting
back
to
the
front
in
a
week
or
two
you
get
the
battalion
he
asked
he
seemed
to
have
followed
my
doings
pretty
closely
believe
i
a
good
chance
i
not
in
this
show
for
honour
and
glory
though
i
want
to
do
the
best
i
can
but
i
wish
to
heaven
it
was
over
all
i
think
of
is
coming
out
of
it
with
a
whole
skin
he
laughed
do
yourself
an
injustice
what
about
the
forward
observation
post
at
the
lone
tree
you
forgot
about
the
whole
skin
then
i
felt
myself
getting
red
was
all
rot
i
said
i
think
who
told
you
about
it
i
hated
the
job
but
i
had
to
do
it
to
prevent
my
subalterns
going
to
glory
they
were
a
lot
of
young
lunatics
if
i
had
sent
one
of
them
he
have
gone
on
his
knees
to
providence
and
asked
for
trouble
sir
walter
was
still
grinning
not
questioning
your
caution
you
have
the
rudiments
of
it
or
our
friends
of
the
black
stone
would
have
gathered
you
in
at
our
last
merry
meeting
i
would
question
it
as
little
as
your
courage
what
exercises
my
mind
is
whether
it
is
best
employed
in
the
trenches
the
war
office
dissatisfied
with
me
i
asked
sharply
are
profoundly
satisfied
they
propose
to
give
you
command
of
your
battalion
presently
if
you
escape
a
stray
bullet
you
will
no
doubt
be
a
brigadier
it
is
a
wonderful
war
for
youth
and
brains
but
i
take
it
you
are
in
this
business
to
serve
your
country
hannay
reckon
i
am
i
said
am
certainly
not
in
it
for
my
health
he
looked
at
my
leg
where
the
doctors
had
dug
out
the
shrapnel
fragments
and
smiled
quizzically
fit
again
he
asked
as
a
sjambok
i
thrive
on
the
racket
and
eat
and
sleep
like
a
schoolboy
he
got
up
and
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fire
his
eyes
staring
abstractedly
out
of
the
window
at
the
wintry
park
is
a
great
game
and
you
are
the
man
for
it
no
doubt
but
there
are
others
who
can
play
it
for
soldiering
today
asks
for
the
average
rather
than
the
exception
in
human
nature
it
is
like
a
big
machine
where
the
parts
are
standardized
you
are
fighting
not
because
you
are
short
of
a
job
but
because
you
want
to
help
england
how
if
you
could
help
her
better
than
by
commanding
a
battalion
or
a
brigade
or
if
it
comes
to
that
a
division
how
if
there
is
a
thing
which
you
alone
can
do
not
some
business
in
an
office
but
a
thing
compared
to
which
your
fight
at
loos
was
a
picnic
you
are
not
afraid
of
danger
well
in
this
job
you
would
not
be
fighting
with
an
army
around
you
but
alone
you
are
fond
of
tackling
difficulties
well
i
can
give
you
a
task
which
will
try
all
your
powers
have
you
anything
to
say
my
heart
was
beginning
to
thump
uncomfortably
sir
walter
was
not
the
man
to
pitch
a
case
too
high
am
a
soldier
i
said
under
orders
but
what
i
am
about
to
propose
does
not
come
by
any
conceivable
stretch
within
the
scope
of
a
soldier
duties
i
shall
perfectly
understand
if
you
decline
you
will
be
acting
as
i
should
act
myself
as
any
sane
man
would
i
would
not
press
you
for
worlds
if
you
wish
it
i
will
not
even
make
the
proposal
but
let
you
go
here
and
now
and
wish
you
good
luck
with
your
battalion
i
do
not
wish
to
perplex
a
good
soldier
with
impossible
decisions
this
piqued
me
and
put
me
on
my
mettle
am
not
going
to
run
away
before
the
guns
fire
let
me
hear
what
you
propose
sir
walter
crossed
to
a
cabinet
unlocked
it
with
a
key
from
his
chain
and
took
a
piece
of
paper
from
a
drawer
it
looked
like
an
ordinary
of
take
it
he
said
your
travels
have
not
extended
to
the
east
i
said
a
shooting
trip
in
east
africa
you
by
any
chance
been
following
the
present
campaign
there
read
the
newspapers
pretty
regularly
since
i
went
to
hospital
i
got
some
pals
in
the
mesopotamia
show
and
of
course
i
keen
to
know
what
is
going
to
happen
at
gallipoli
and
salonika
i
gather
that
egypt
is
pretty
safe
you
will
give
me
your
attention
for
ten
minutes
i
will
supplement
your
newspaper
reading
sir
walter
lay
back
in
an
and
spoke
to
the
ceiling
it
was
the
best
story
the
clearest
and
the
fullest
i
had
ever
got
of
any
bit
of
the
war
he
told
me
just
how
and
why
and
when
turkey
had
left
the
rails
i
heard
about
her
grievances
over
our
seizure
of
her
ironclads
of
the
mischief
the
coming
of
the
had
wrought
of
enver
and
his
precious
committee
and
the
way
they
had
got
a
cinch
on
the
old
turk
when
he
had
spoken
for
a
bit
he
began
to
question
me
are
an
intelligent
fellow
and
you
will
ask
how
a
polish
adventurer
meaning
enver
and
a
collection
of
jews
and
gipsies
should
have
got
control
of
a
proud
race
the
ordinary
man
will
tell
you
that
it
was
german
organization
backed
up
with
german
money
and
german
arms
you
will
inquire
again
how
since
turkey
is
primarily
a
religious
power
islam
has
played
so
small
a
part
in
it
all
the
is
neglected
and
though
the
kaiser
proclaims
a
holy
war
and
calls
himself
hadji
mohammed
guilliamo
and
says
the
hohenzollerns
are
descended
from
the
prophet
that
seems
to
have
fallen
pretty
flat
the
ordinary
man
again
will
answer
that
islam
in
turkey
is
becoming
a
back
number
and
that
krupp
guns
are
the
new
gods
yet
i
do
know
i
do
not
quite
believe
in
islam
becoming
a
back
number
at
it
in
another
way
he
went
on
it
were
enver
and
germany
alone
dragging
turkey
into
a
european
war
for
purposes
that
no
turk
cared
a
rush
about
we
might
expect
to
find
the
regular
army
obedient
and
constantinople
but
in
the
provinces
where
islam
is
strong
there
would
be
trouble
many
of
us
counted
on
that
but
we
have
been
disappointed
the
syrian
army
is
as
fanatical
as
the
hordes
of
the
mahdi
the
senussi
have
taken
a
hand
in
the
game
the
persian
moslems
are
threatening
trouble
there
is
a
dry
wind
blowing
through
the
east
and
the
parched
grasses
wait
the
spark
and
that
wind
is
blowing
towards
the
indian
border
whence
comes
that
wind
think
you
sir
walter
had
lowered
his
voice
and
was
speaking
very
slow
and
distinct
i
could
hear
the
rain
dripping
from
the
eaves
of
the
window
and
far
off
the
hoot
of
taxis
in
whitehall
you
an
explanation
hannay
he
asked
again
looks
as
if
islam
had
a
bigger
hand
in
the
thing
than
we
thought
i
said
fancy
religion
is
the
only
thing
to
knit
up
such
a
scattered
empire
are
right
he
said
must
be
right
we
have
laughed
at
the
holy
war
the
jehad
that
old
von
der
goltz
prophesied
but
i
believe
that
stupid
old
man
with
the
big
spectacles
was
right
there
is
a
jehad
preparing
the
question
is
how
hanged
if
i
know
i
said
i
bet
it
wo
be
done
by
a
pack
of
stout
german
officers
in
i
fancy
you
manufacture
holy
wars
out
of
krupp
guns
alone
and
a
few
staff
officers
and
a
battle
cruiser
with
her
boilers
burst
they
are
not
fools
however
much
we
try
to
persuade
ourselves
of
the
contrary
but
supposing
they
had
got
some
tremendous
sacred
sanction
some
holy
thing
some
book
or
gospel
or
some
new
prophet
from
the
desert
something
which
would
cast
over
the
whole
ugly
mechanism
of
german
war
the
glamour
of
the
old
torrential
raids
which
crumpled
the
byzantine
empire
and
shook
the
walls
of
vienna
islam
is
a
fighting
creed
and
the
mullah
still
stands
in
the
pulpit
with
the
koran
in
one
hand
and
a
drawn
sword
in
the
other
supposing
there
is
some
ark
of
the
covenant
which
will
madden
the
remotest
moslem
peasant
with
dreams
of
paradise
what
then
my
friend
there
will
be
hell
let
loose
in
those
parts
pretty
soon
which
may
spread
beyond
persia
remember
lies
india
keep
to
suppositions
how
much
do
you
know
i
asked
little
except
the
fact
but
the
fact
is
beyond
dispute
i
have
reports
from
agents
everywhere
pedlars
in
south
russia
afghan
turcoman
merchants
pilgrims
on
the
road
to
mecca
sheikhs
in
north
africa
sailors
on
the
black
sea
coasters
mongols
hindu
fakirs
greek
traders
in
the
gulf
as
well
as
respectable
consuls
who
use
cyphers
they
tell
the
same
story
the
east
is
waiting
for
a
revelation
it
has
been
promised
one
some
star
man
prophecy
or
trinket
is
coming
out
of
the
west
the
germans
know
and
that
is
the
card
with
which
they
are
going
to
astonish
the
world
the
mission
you
spoke
of
for
me
is
to
go
and
find
out
he
nodded
gravely
is
the
crazy
and
impossible
mission
me
one
thing
sir
walter
i
said
know
it
is
the
fashion
in
this
country
if
a
man
has
a
special
knowledge
to
set
him
to
some
job
exactly
the
opposite
i
know
all
about
damaraland
but
instead
of
being
put
on
botha
staff
as
i
applied
to
be
i
was
kept
in
hampshire
mud
till
the
campaign
in
german
south
west
africa
was
over
i
know
a
man
who
could
pass
as
an
arab
but
do
you
think
they
would
send
him
to
the
east
they
left
him
in
my
battalion
a
lucky
thing
for
me
for
he
saved
my
life
at
loos
i
know
the
fashion
but
is
this
just
carrying
it
a
bit
too
far
there
must
be
thousands
of
men
who
have
spent
years
in
the
east
and
talk
any
language
they
the
fellows
for
this
job
i
never
saw
a
turk
in
my
life
except
a
chap
who
did
wrestling
turns
in
a
show
at
kimberley
you
picked
about
the
most
useless
man
on
earth
been
a
mining
engineer
hannay
sir
walter
said
you
wanted
a
man
to
prospect
for
gold
in
barotseland
you
would
of
course
like
to
get
one
who
knew
the
country
and
the
people
and
the
language
but
the
first
thing
you
would
require
in
him
would
be
that
he
had
a
nose
for
finding
gold
and
knew
his
business
that
is
the
position
now
i
believe
that
you
have
a
nose
for
finding
out
what
our
enemies
try
to
hide
i
know
that
you
are
brave
and
cool
and
resourceful
that
is
why
i
tell
you
the
story
besides
he
unrolled
a
big
map
of
europe
on
the
wall
ca
tell
you
where
you
get
on
the
track
of
the
secret
but
i
can
put
a
limit
to
the
quest
you
wo
find
it
east
of
the
bosporus
not
yet
it
is
still
in
europe
it
may
be
in
constantinople
or
in
thrace
it
may
be
farther
west
but
it
is
moving
eastwards
if
you
are
in
time
you
may
cut
into
its
march
to
constantinople
that
much
i
can
tell
you
the
secret
is
known
in
germany
too
to
those
whom
it
concerns
it
is
in
europe
that
the
seeker
must
search
at
present
me
more
i
said
can
give
me
no
details
and
no
instructions
obviously
you
can
give
me
no
help
if
i
come
to
grief
he
nodded
would
be
beyond
the
pale
give
me
a
free
hand
you
can
have
what
money
you
like
and
you
can
get
what
help
you
like
you
can
follow
any
plan
you
fancy
and
go
anywhere
you
think
fruitful
we
can
give
no
directions
last
question
you
say
it
is
important
tell
me
just
how
important
is
life
and
death
he
said
solemnly
can
put
it
no
higher
and
no
lower
once
we
know
what
is
the
menace
we
can
meet
it
as
long
as
we
are
in
the
dark
it
works
unchecked
and
we
may
be
too
late
the
war
must
be
won
or
lost
in
europe
yes
but
if
the
east
blazes
up
our
effort
will
be
distracted
from
europe
and
the
great
may
fail
the
stakes
are
no
less
than
victory
and
defeat
hannay
i
got
out
of
my
chair
and
walked
to
the
window
it
was
a
difficult
moment
in
my
life
i
was
happy
in
my
soldiering
above
all
happy
in
the
company
of
my
brother
officers
i
was
asked
to
go
off
into
the
enemy
lands
on
a
quest
for
which
i
believed
i
was
manifestly
unfitted
a
business
of
lonely
days
and
nights
of
strain
of
deadly
peril
shrouding
me
like
a
garment
looking
out
on
the
bleak
weather
i
shivered
it
was
too
grim
a
business
too
inhuman
for
flesh
and
blood
but
sir
walter
had
called
it
a
matter
of
life
and
death
and
i
had
told
him
that
i
was
out
to
serve
my
country
he
could
not
give
me
orders
but
was
i
not
under
orders
higher
orders
than
my
brigadier
i
thought
myself
incompetent
but
cleverer
men
than
me
thought
me
competent
or
at
least
competent
enough
for
a
sporting
chance
i
knew
in
my
soul
that
if
i
declined
i
should
never
be
quite
at
peace
in
the
world
again
and
yet
sir
walter
had
called
the
scheme
madness
and
said
that
he
himself
would
never
have
accepted
how
does
one
make
a
great
decision
i
swear
that
when
i
turned
round
to
speak
i
meant
to
refuse
but
my
answer
was
yes
and
i
had
crossed
the
rubicon
my
voice
sounded
cracked
and
far
away
sir
walter
shook
hands
with
me
and
his
eyes
blinked
a
little
may
be
sending
you
to
your
death
hannay
good
god
what
a
damned
duty
is
if
so
i
shall
be
haunted
with
regrets
but
you
will
never
repent
have
no
fear
of
that
you
have
chosen
the
roughest
road
but
it
goes
straight
to
the
he
handed
me
the
of
on
it
were
written
three
words
and
is
the
only
clue
we
possess
he
said
can
not
construe
it
but
i
can
tell
you
the
story
we
have
had
our
agents
working
in
persia
and
mesopotamia
for
years
mostly
young
officers
of
the
indian
army
they
carry
their
lives
in
their
hands
and
now
and
then
one
disappears
and
the
sewers
of
baghdad
might
tell
a
tale
but
they
find
out
many
things
and
they
count
the
game
worth
the
candle
they
have
told
us
of
the
star
rising
in
the
west
but
they
could
give
us
no
details
all
but
one
the
best
of
them
he
had
been
working
between
mosul
and
the
persian
frontier
as
a
muleteer
and
had
been
south
into
the
bakhtiari
hills
he
found
out
something
but
his
enemies
knew
that
he
knew
and
he
was
pursued
three
months
ago
just
before
kut
he
staggered
into
delamain
camp
with
ten
bullet
holes
in
him
and
a
knife
slash
on
his
forehead
he
mumbled
his
name
but
beyond
that
and
the
fact
that
there
was
a
something
coming
from
the
west
he
told
them
nothing
he
died
in
ten
minutes
they
found
this
paper
on
him
and
since
he
cried
out
the
word
kasredin
in
his
last
moments
it
must
have
had
something
to
do
with
his
quest
it
is
for
you
to
find
out
if
it
has
any
meaning
i
folded
it
up
and
placed
it
in
my
a
great
fellow
what
was
his
name
i
asked
sir
walter
did
not
answer
at
once
he
was
looking
out
of
the
window
name
he
said
at
last
harry
bullivant
he
was
my
son
god
rest
his
brave
soul
chapter
two
the
gathering
of
the
missionaries
i
wrote
out
a
wire
to
sandy
asking
him
to
come
up
by
the
train
and
meet
me
at
my
flat
have
chosen
my
colleague
i
said
arbuthnot
boy
his
father
was
at
harrow
with
me
i
know
the
fellow
harry
used
to
bring
him
down
to
fish
tallish
with
a
lean
face
and
a
pair
of
brown
eyes
like
a
pretty
girl
i
know
his
record
too
there
a
good
deal
about
him
in
this
office
he
rode
through
yemen
which
no
white
man
ever
did
before
the
arabs
let
him
pass
for
they
thought
him
stark
mad
and
argued
that
the
hand
of
allah
was
heavy
enough
on
him
without
their
efforts
to
every
kind
of
albanian
bandit
also
he
used
to
take
a
hand
in
turkish
politics
and
got
a
huge
reputation
some
englishman
was
once
complaining
to
old
mahmoud
shevkat
about
the
scarcity
of
statesmen
in
western
europe
and
mahmoud
broke
in
with
have
you
not
the
honourable
arbuthnot
you
say
he
in
your
battalion
i
was
wondering
what
had
become
of
him
for
we
tried
to
get
hold
of
him
here
but
he
had
left
no
address
ludovick
arbuthnot
yes
that
the
man
buried
deep
in
the
commissioned
ranks
of
the
new
army
well
we
get
him
out
pretty
quick
knew
he
had
knocked
about
the
east
but
i
did
know
he
was
that
kind
of
swell
sandy
not
the
chap
to
buck
about
himself
would
said
sir
walter
had
always
a
more
than
oriental
reticence
i
got
another
colleague
for
you
if
you
like
him
he
looked
at
his
watch
can
get
to
the
savoy
grill
room
in
five
minutes
in
a
go
in
from
the
strand
turn
to
your
left
and
you
will
see
in
the
alcove
on
the
side
a
table
with
one
large
american
gentleman
sitting
at
it
they
know
him
there
so
he
will
have
the
table
to
himself
i
want
you
to
go
and
sit
down
beside
him
say
you
come
from
me
his
name
is
mr
john
scantlebury
blenkiron
now
a
citizen
of
boston
but
born
and
raised
in
indiana
put
this
envelope
in
your
pocket
but
do
read
its
contents
till
you
have
talked
to
him
i
want
you
to
form
your
own
opinion
about
mr
blenkiron
i
went
out
of
the
foreign
office
in
as
muddled
a
frame
of
mind
as
any
diplomatist
who
ever
left
its
portals
i
was
most
desperately
depressed
to
begin
with
i
was
in
a
complete
funk
i
had
always
thought
i
was
about
as
brave
as
the
average
man
but
there
courage
and
courage
and
mine
was
certainly
not
the
impassive
kind
stick
me
down
in
a
trench
and
i
could
stand
being
shot
at
as
well
as
most
people
and
my
blood
could
get
hot
if
it
were
given
a
chance
but
i
think
i
had
too
much
imagination
i
could
shake
off
the
beastly
forecasts
that
kept
crowding
my
mind
in
about
a
fortnight
i
calculated
i
would
be
dead
shot
as
a
spy
a
rotten
sort
of
ending
at
the
moment
i
was
quite
safe
looking
for
a
taxi
in
the
middle
of
whitehall
but
the
sweat
broke
on
my
forehead
i
felt
as
i
had
felt
in
my
adventure
before
the
war
but
this
was
far
worse
for
it
was
more
and
premeditated
and
i
did
seem
to
have
even
a
sporting
chance
i
watched
the
figures
in
khaki
passing
on
the
pavement
and
thought
what
a
nice
safe
prospect
they
had
compared
to
mine
yes
even
if
next
week
they
were
in
the
hohenzollern
or
the
hairpin
trench
at
the
quarries
or
that
ugly
angle
at
hooge
i
wondered
why
i
had
not
been
happier
that
morning
before
i
got
that
infernal
wire
suddenly
all
the
trivialities
of
english
life
seemed
to
me
inexpressibly
dear
and
terribly
far
away
i
was
very
angry
with
bullivant
till
i
remembered
how
fair
he
had
been
my
fate
was
my
own
choosing
when
i
was
hunting
the
black
stone
the
interest
of
the
problem
had
helped
to
keep
me
going
but
now
i
could
see
no
problem
my
mind
had
nothing
to
work
on
but
three
words
of
gibberish
on
a
sheet
of
paper
and
a
mystery
of
which
sir
walter
had
been
convinced
but
to
which
he
could
give
a
name
it
was
like
the
story
i
had
read
of
saint
teresa
setting
off
at
the
age
of
ten
with
her
small
brother
to
convert
the
moors
i
sat
huddled
in
the
taxi
with
my
chin
on
my
breast
wishing
that
i
had
lost
a
leg
at
loos
and
been
comfortably
tucked
away
for
the
rest
of
the
war
sure
enough
i
found
my
man
in
the
grill
room
there
he
was
feeding
solemnly
with
a
napkin
tucked
under
his
chin
he
was
a
big
fellow
with
a
fat
sallow
face
i
disregarded
the
hovering
waiter
and
pulled
up
a
chair
beside
the
american
at
the
little
table
he
turned
on
me
a
pair
of
full
sleepy
eyes
like
a
ruminating
ox
blenkiron
i
asked
have
my
name
sir
he
said
john
scantlebury
blenkiron
i
would
wish
you
good
morning
if
i
saw
anything
good
in
this
darned
british
weather
come
from
sir
walter
bullivant
i
said
speaking
low
said
he
walter
is
a
very
good
friend
of
mine
pleased
to
meet
you
mr
or
i
guess
it
colonel
i
said
hannay
i
was
wondering
what
this
sleepy
yankee
could
do
to
help
me
me
to
offer
you
luncheon
major
here
waiter
bring
the
carte
i
regret
that
i
can
not
join
you
in
sampling
the
efforts
of
the
management
of
this
hotel
i
suffer
sir
from
dyspepsia
duodenal
dyspepsia
it
gets
me
two
hours
after
a
meal
and
gives
me
hell
just
below
the
so
i
am
obliged
to
adopt
a
diet
my
nourishment
is
fish
sir
and
boiled
milk
and
a
little
dry
toast
a
melancholy
descent
from
the
days
when
i
could
do
justice
to
a
lunch
at
sherry
and
sup
off
and
devilled
bones
he
sighed
from
the
depths
of
his
capacious
frame
i
ordered
an
omelette
and
a
chop
and
took
another
look
at
him
the
large
eyes
seemed
to
be
gazing
steadily
at
me
without
seeing
me
they
were
as
vacant
as
an
abstracted
child
but
i
had
an
uncomfortable
feeling
that
they
saw
more
than
mine
have
been
fighting
major
the
battle
of
loos
well
i
guess
that
must
have
been
some
battle
we
in
america
respect
the
fighting
of
the
british
soldier
but
we
do
quite
catch
on
to
the
of
the
british
generals
we
opine
that
there
is
more
bellicosity
than
science
among
your
highbrows
that
is
so
my
father
fought
at
chattanooga
but
these
eyes
have
seen
nothing
gorier
than
a
presidential
election
say
is
there
any
way
i
could
be
let
into
a
scene
of
real
bloodshed
his
serious
tone
made
me
laugh
are
plenty
of
your
countrymen
in
the
present
show
i
said
french
foreign
legion
is
full
of
young
americans
and
so
is
our
army
service
corps
half
the
chauffeurs
you
strike
in
france
seem
to
come
from
the
states
he
sighed
did
think
of
some
belligerent
stunt
a
year
back
but
i
reflected
that
the
good
god
had
not
given
john
blenkiron
the
kind
of
martial
figure
that
would
do
credit
to
the
tented
field
also
i
recollected
that
we
americans
were
nootrals
benevolent
nootrals
and
that
it
did
not
become
me
to
be
butting
into
the
struggles
of
the
effete
monarchies
of
europe
so
i
stopped
at
home
it
was
a
big
renunciation
major
for
i
was
lying
sick
during
the
philippines
business
and
i
have
never
seen
the
lawless
passions
of
men
let
loose
on
a
battlefield
and
as
a
stoodent
of
humanity
i
hankered
for
the
experience
have
you
been
doing
i
asked
the
calm
gentleman
had
begun
to
interest
me
he
said
just
waited
the
lord
has
blessed
me
with
money
to
burn
so
i
did
need
to
go
scrambling
like
a
wild
cat
for
war
contracts
but
i
reckoned
i
would
get
let
into
the
game
somehow
and
i
was
being
a
nootral
i
was
in
an
advantageous
position
to
take
a
hand
i
had
a
pretty
hectic
time
for
a
while
and
then
i
reckoned
i
would
leave
god
country
and
see
what
was
doing
in
europe
i
have
counted
myself
out
of
the
bloodshed
business
but
as
your
poet
sings
peace
has
its
victories
not
less
renowned
than
war
and
i
reckon
that
means
that
a
nootral
can
have
a
share
in
a
scrap
as
well
as
a
belligerent
the
best
kind
of
neutrality
i
ever
heard
of
i
said
the
right
kind
he
replied
solemnly
major
what
are
your
lot
fighting
for
for
your
own
skins
and
your
empire
and
the
peace
of
europe
waal
those
ideals
do
concern
us
one
cent
we
not
europeans
and
there
are
any
german
trenches
on
long
island
yet
you
made
the
ring
in
europe
and
if
we
came
butting
in
it
be
the
rules
of
the
game
you
would
welcome
us
and
i
guess
be
right
we
that
we
ca
interfere
and
that
was
what
my
friend
president
wilson
meant
when
he
opined
that
america
was
too
proud
to
fight
so
we
nootrals
but
likewise
we
benevolent
nootrals
as
i
follow
events
there
a
skunk
been
let
loose
in
the
world
and
the
odour
of
it
is
going
to
make
life
none
too
sweet
till
it
is
cleared
away
it
was
us
that
stirred
up
that
skunk
but
got
to
take
a
hand
in
disinfecting
the
planet
see
we
ca
fight
but
by
god
some
of
us
are
going
to
sweat
blood
to
sweep
the
mess
up
officially
we
do
nothing
except
give
off
notes
like
a
leaky
boiler
gives
off
steam
but
as
individooal
citizens
we
in
it
up
to
the
neck
so
in
the
spirit
of
jefferson
davis
and
woodrow
wilson
going
to
be
the
nootralist
kind
of
nootral
till
kaiser
will
be
sorry
he
did
declare
war
on
america
at
the
beginning
i
was
completely
recovering
my
temper
this
fellow
was
a
perfect
jewel
and
his
spirit
put
purpose
into
me
guess
you
british
were
the
same
kind
of
nootral
when
your
admiral
warned
off
the
german
fleet
from
interfering
with
dewey
in
manila
bay
in
mr
blenkiron
drank
up
the
last
drop
of
his
boiled
milk
and
lit
a
thin
black
cigar
i
leaned
forward
you
talked
to
sir
walter
i
asked
have
talked
to
him
and
he
has
given
me
to
understand
that
there
a
deal
ahead
which
you
going
to
boss
there
are
no
flies
on
that
big
man
and
if
he
says
it
good
business
then
you
can
count
me
in
know
that
it
uncommonly
dangerous
judged
so
but
it
do
do
to
begin
counting
risks
i
believe
in
an
and
beneficent
providence
but
you
have
got
to
trust
him
and
give
him
a
chance
what
life
anyhow
for
me
it
living
on
a
strict
diet
and
having
frequent
pains
in
my
stomach
it
is
such
an
almighty
lot
to
give
up
provided
you
get
a
good
price
in
the
deal
besides
how
big
is
the
risk
about
one
in
the
morning
when
you
ca
sleep
it
will
be
the
size
of
mount
everest
but
if
you
run
out
to
meet
it
it
will
be
a
hillock
you
can
jump
over
the
grizzly
looks
very
fierce
when
you
taking
your
ticket
for
the
rockies
and
wondering
if
you
come
back
but
he
just
an
ordinary
bear
when
you
got
the
sight
of
your
rifle
on
him
i
wo
think
about
risks
till
i
up
to
my
neck
in
them
and
do
see
the
road
out
i
scribbled
my
address
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
handed
it
to
the
stout
philosopher
to
dinner
tonight
at
eight
i
said
thank
you
major
a
little
fish
please
and
some
hot
milk
you
will
forgive
me
if
i
borrow
your
couch
after
the
meal
and
spend
the
evening
on
my
back
that
is
the
advice
of
my
noo
doctor
i
got
a
taxi
and
drove
to
my
club
on
the
way
i
opened
the
envelope
sir
walter
had
given
me
it
contained
a
number
of
jottings
the
dossier
of
mr
blenkiron
he
had
done
wonders
for
the
allies
in
the
states
he
had
nosed
out
the
dumba
plot
and
had
been
instrumental
in
getting
the
portfolio
of
dr
albert
von
papen
spies
had
tried
to
murder
him
after
he
had
defeated
an
attempt
to
blow
up
one
of
the
big
gun
factories
sir
walter
had
written
at
the
end
best
man
we
ever
had
better
than
scudder
he
would
go
through
hell
with
a
box
of
bismuth
tablets
and
a
pack
of
patience
cards
i
went
into
the
little
back
borrowed
an
atlas
from
the
library
poked
up
the
fire
and
sat
down
to
think
mr
blenkiron
had
given
me
the
fillip
i
needed
my
mind
was
beginning
to
work
now
and
was
running
wide
over
the
whole
business
not
that
i
hoped
to
find
anything
by
my
cogitations
it
was
thinking
in
an
that
would
solve
the
mystery
but
i
was
getting
a
sort
of
grip
on
a
plan
of
operations
and
to
my
relief
i
had
stopped
thinking
about
the
risks
blenkiron
had
shamed
me
out
of
that
if
a
sedentary
dyspeptic
could
show
that
kind
of
nerve
i
was
going
to
be
behind
him
i
went
back
to
my
flat
about
five
my
man
paddock
had
gone
to
the
wars
long
ago
so
i
had
shifted
to
one
of
the
new
blocks
in
park
lane
where
they
provide
food
and
service
i
kept
the
place
on
to
have
a
home
to
go
to
when
i
got
leave
it
a
miserable
business
holidaying
in
an
hotel
sandy
was
devouring
with
the
serious
resolution
of
a
convalescent
dick
what
the
news
is
it
a
brass
hat
or
the
boot
i
said
you
and
i
are
going
to
disappear
from
his
majesty
forces
seconded
for
special
service
my
sainted
aunt
said
sandy
is
it
for
heaven
sake
put
me
out
of
pain
have
we
to
tout
deputations
of
suspicious
neutrals
over
munition
works
or
take
the
shivering
journalist
in
a
where
he
can
imagine
he
sees
a
boche
news
will
keep
but
i
can
tell
you
this
much
it
about
as
safe
and
easy
as
to
go
through
the
german
lines
with
a
that
not
so
dusty
said
sandy
and
began
cheerfully
on
the
muffins
i
must
spare
a
moment
to
introduce
sandy
to
the
reader
for
he
can
not
be
allowed
to
slip
into
this
tale
by
a
if
you
will
consult
the
peerage
you
will
find
that
to
edward
cospatrick
fifteenth
baron
clanroyden
there
was
born
in
the
year
as
his
second
son
ludovick
gustavus
arbuthnot
commonly
called
the
honourable
etc
the
said
son
was
educated
at
eton
and
new
college
oxford
was
a
captain
in
the
tweeddale
yeomanry
and
served
for
some
years
as
honorary
attache
at
various
embassies
the
peerage
will
stop
short
at
this
point
but
that
is
by
no
means
the
end
of
the
story
for
the
rest
you
must
consult
very
different
authorities
lean
brown
men
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
may
be
seen
on
the
london
pavements
now
and
then
in
creased
clothes
walking
with
the
light
outland
step
slinking
into
clubs
as
if
they
could
not
remember
whether
or
not
they
belonged
to
them
from
them
you
may
get
news
of
sandy
better
still
you
will
hear
of
him
at
little
forgotten
fishing
ports
where
the
albanian
mountains
dip
to
the
adriatic
if
you
struck
a
mecca
pilgrimage
the
odds
are
you
would
meet
a
dozen
of
sandy
friends
in
it
in
shepherds
huts
in
the
caucasus
you
will
find
bits
of
his
clothing
for
he
has
a
knack
of
shedding
garments
as
he
goes
in
the
caravanserais
of
bokhara
and
samarkand
he
is
known
and
there
are
shikaris
in
the
pamirs
who
still
speak
of
him
round
their
fires
if
you
were
going
to
visit
petrograd
or
rome
or
cairo
it
would
be
no
use
asking
him
for
introductions
if
he
gave
them
they
would
lead
you
into
strange
haunts
but
if
fate
compelled
you
to
go
to
llasa
or
yarkand
or
seistan
he
could
map
out
your
road
for
you
and
pass
the
word
to
potent
friends
we
call
ourselves
insular
but
the
truth
is
that
we
are
the
only
race
on
earth
that
can
produce
men
capable
of
getting
inside
the
skin
of
remote
peoples
perhaps
the
scots
are
better
than
the
english
but
we
all
a
thousand
per
cent
better
than
anybody
else
sandy
was
the
wandering
scot
carried
to
the
pitch
of
genius
in
old
days
he
would
have
led
a
crusade
or
discovered
a
new
road
to
the
indies
today
he
merely
roamed
as
the
spirit
moved
him
till
the
war
swept
him
up
and
dumped
him
down
in
my
battalion
i
got
out
sir
walter
of
it
was
not
the
original
naturally
he
wanted
to
keep
that
but
it
was
a
careful
tracing
i
took
it
that
harry
bullivant
had
not
written
down
the
words
as
a
memo
for
his
own
use
people
who
follow
his
career
have
good
memories
he
must
have
written
them
in
order
that
if
he
perished
and
his
body
was
found
his
friends
might
get
a
clue
wherefore
i
argued
the
words
must
be
intelligible
to
somebody
or
other
of
our
persuasion
and
likewise
they
must
be
pretty
well
gibberish
to
any
turk
or
german
that
found
them
the
first
i
could
make
nothing
of
i
asked
sandy
mean
he
said
still
munching
crumpets
that
i
asked
sharply
the
general
believed
to
be
commanding
against
us
in
mesopotamia
i
remember
him
years
ago
in
aleppo
he
talked
bad
french
and
drank
the
sweetest
of
sweet
champagne
i
looked
closely
at
the
paper
the
was
unmistakable
is
nothing
it
means
in
arabic
the
house
of
faith
and
might
cover
anything
from
hagia
sofia
to
a
suburban
villa
what
your
next
puzzle
dick
have
you
entered
for
a
prize
competition
in
a
weekly
paper
i
read
out
is
the
latin
for
a
crab
likewise
it
is
the
name
of
a
painful
disease
it
is
also
a
sign
of
the
zodiac
i
read
you
have
me
it
sounds
like
the
number
of
a
the
police
would
find
out
for
you
i
call
this
rather
a
difficult
competition
what
the
prize
i
passed
him
the
paper
wrote
it
it
looks
as
if
he
had
been
in
a
hurry
bullivant
i
said
sandy
face
grew
solemn
harry
he
was
at
my
tutor
the
best
fellow
god
ever
made
i
saw
his
name
in
the
casualty
list
before
kut
harry
did
do
things
without
a
purpose
what
the
story
of
this
paper
till
after
dinner
i
said
going
to
change
and
have
a
bath
there
an
american
coming
to
dine
and
he
part
of
the
business
mr
blenkiron
arrived
punctual
to
the
minute
in
a
fur
coat
like
a
russian
prince
now
that
i
saw
him
on
his
feet
i
could
judge
him
better
he
had
a
fat
face
but
was
not
too
plump
in
figure
and
very
muscular
wrists
showed
below
his
i
fancied
that
if
the
occasion
called
he
might
be
a
good
man
with
his
hands
sandy
and
i
ate
a
hearty
meal
but
the
american
picked
at
his
boiled
fish
and
sipped
his
milk
a
drop
at
a
time
when
the
servant
had
cleared
away
he
was
as
good
as
his
word
and
laid
himself
out
on
my
sofa
i
offered
him
a
good
cigar
but
he
preferred
one
of
his
own
lean
black
abominations
sandy
stretched
his
length
in
an
easy
chair
and
lit
his
pipe
for
your
story
dick
he
said
i
began
as
sir
walter
had
begun
with
me
by
telling
them
about
the
puzzle
in
the
near
east
i
pitched
a
pretty
good
yarn
for
i
had
been
thinking
a
lot
about
it
and
the
mystery
of
the
business
had
caught
my
fancy
sandy
got
very
keen
is
possible
enough
indeed
i
been
expecting
it
though
hanged
if
i
can
imagine
what
card
the
germans
have
got
up
their
sleeve
it
might
be
any
one
of
twenty
things
thirty
years
ago
there
was
a
bogus
prophecy
that
played
the
devil
in
yemen
or
it
might
be
a
flag
such
as
ali
wad
helu
had
or
a
jewel
like
solomon
necklace
in
abyssinia
you
never
know
what
will
start
off
a
jehad
but
i
rather
think
it
a
man
could
he
get
his
purchase
i
asked
hard
to
say
if
it
were
merely
wild
tribesmen
like
the
bedouin
he
might
have
got
a
reputation
as
a
saint
and
or
he
might
be
a
fellow
that
preached
a
pure
religion
like
the
chap
that
founded
the
senussi
but
i
inclined
to
think
he
must
be
something
extra
special
if
he
can
put
a
spell
on
the
whole
moslem
world
the
turk
and
the
persian
would
follow
the
ordinary
new
theology
game
he
must
be
of
the
blood
your
mahdis
and
mullahs
and
imams
were
nobodies
but
they
had
only
a
local
prestige
to
capture
all
islam
and
i
gather
that
is
what
we
fear
the
man
must
be
of
the
koreish
the
tribe
of
the
prophet
himself
how
could
any
impostor
prove
that
for
i
suppose
he
an
impostor
would
have
to
combine
a
lot
of
claims
his
descent
must
be
pretty
good
to
begin
with
and
there
are
families
remember
that
claim
the
koreish
blood
then
he
have
to
be
rather
a
wonder
on
his
own
account
saintly
eloquent
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
i
expect
have
to
show
a
sign
though
what
that
could
be
i
have
a
notion
know
the
east
about
as
well
as
any
living
man
do
you
think
that
kind
of
thing
is
possible
i
asked
said
sandy
with
a
grave
face
there
the
ground
cleared
to
begin
with
then
there
the
evidence
of
pretty
well
every
secret
agent
we
possess
that
all
seems
to
prove
the
fact
but
we
have
no
details
and
no
clues
except
that
bit
of
paper
i
told
them
the
story
of
it
sandy
studied
it
with
wrinkled
brows
beats
me
but
it
may
be
the
key
for
all
that
a
clue
may
be
dumb
in
london
and
shout
aloud
at
baghdad
just
the
point
i
was
coming
to
sir
walter
says
this
thing
is
about
as
important
for
our
cause
as
big
guns
he
ca
give
me
orders
but
he
offers
the
job
of
going
out
to
find
what
the
mischief
is
once
he
knows
that
he
says
he
can
checkmate
it
but
it
got
to
be
found
out
soon
for
the
mine
may
be
sprung
at
any
moment
i
taken
on
the
job
will
you
help
sandy
was
studying
the
ceiling
should
add
that
it
about
as
safe
as
playing
at
the
loos
the
day
you
and
i
went
in
and
if
we
fail
nobody
can
help
us
of
course
of
course
said
sandy
in
an
abstracted
voice
mr
blenkiron
having
finished
his
recumbency
had
sat
up
and
pulled
a
small
table
towards
him
from
his
pocket
he
had
taken
a
pack
of
patience
cards
and
had
begun
to
play
the
game
called
the
double
napoleon
he
seemed
to
be
oblivious
of
the
conversation
suddenly
i
had
a
feeling
that
the
whole
affair
was
stark
lunacy
here
were
we
three
simpletons
sitting
in
a
london
flat
and
projecting
a
mission
into
the
enemy
citadel
without
an
idea
what
we
were
to
do
or
how
we
were
to
do
it
and
one
of
the
three
was
looking
at
the
ceiling
and
whistling
softly
through
his
teeth
and
another
was
playing
patience
the
farce
of
the
thing
struck
me
so
keenly
that
i
laughed
sandy
looked
at
me
sharply
feel
like
that
same
with
me
it
idiocy
but
all
war
is
idiotic
and
the
most
idiot
is
apt
to
win
we
to
go
on
this
mad
trail
wherever
we
think
we
can
hit
it
well
i
with
you
but
i
do
mind
admitting
that
i
in
a
blue
funk
i
had
got
myself
adjusted
to
this
trench
business
and
was
quite
happy
and
now
you
have
hoicked
me
out
and
my
feet
are
cold
do
believe
you
know
what
fear
is
i
said
you
wrong
dick
he
said
earnestly
man
who
is
a
maniac
knows
fear
i
have
done
some
daft
things
but
i
never
started
on
them
without
wishing
they
were
over
once
i
in
the
show
i
get
easier
and
by
the
time
i
coming
out
i
sorry
to
leave
it
but
at
the
start
my
feet
are
icy
i
take
it
you
coming
he
said
did
imagine
i
would
go
back
on
you
you
sir
i
addressed
blenkiron
his
game
of
patience
seemed
to
be
coming
out
he
was
completing
eight
little
heaps
of
cards
with
a
contented
grunt
as
i
spoke
he
raised
his
sleepy
eyes
and
nodded
yes
he
said
gentlemen
must
think
that
i
have
been
following
your
most
engrossing
conversation
i
guess
i
have
missed
a
syllable
i
find
that
a
game
of
patience
stimulates
the
digestion
after
meals
and
conduces
to
quiet
reflection
john
blenkiron
is
with
you
all
the
time
he
shuffled
the
cards
and
dealt
for
a
new
game
i
do
think
i
ever
expected
a
refusal
but
this
ready
assent
cheered
me
wonderfully
i
could
have
faced
the
thing
alone
that
settled
now
for
ways
and
means
we
three
have
got
to
put
ourselves
in
the
way
of
finding
out
germany
secret
and
we
have
to
go
where
it
is
known
somehow
or
other
we
have
to
reach
constantinople
and
to
beat
the
biggest
area
of
country
we
must
go
by
different
roads
sandy
my
lad
you
got
to
get
into
turkey
the
only
one
of
us
that
knows
that
engaging
people
you
ca
get
in
by
europe
very
easily
so
you
must
try
asia
what
about
the
coast
of
asia
minor
could
be
done
he
said
better
leave
that
entirely
to
me
i
find
out
the
best
way
i
suppose
the
foreign
office
will
help
me
to
get
to
the
place
i
said
no
good
getting
too
far
east
the
secret
so
far
as
concerns
us
is
still
west
of
constantinople
see
that
i
blow
in
on
the
bosporus
by
a
short
tack
you
mr
blenkiron
i
would
suggest
a
straight
journey
you
an
american
and
can
travel
through
germany
direct
but
i
wonder
how
far
your
activities
in
new
york
will
allow
you
to
pass
as
a
neutral
have
considered
that
sir
he
said
have
given
some
thought
to
the
pecooliar
psychology
of
the
great
german
nation
as
i
read
them
they
as
cunning
as
cats
and
if
you
play
the
feline
game
they
will
outwit
you
every
time
yes
sir
they
are
no
slouches
at
if
i
were
to
buy
a
pair
of
false
whiskers
and
dye
my
hair
and
dress
like
a
baptist
parson
and
go
into
germany
on
the
peace
racket
i
guess
they
be
on
my
trail
like
a
knife
and
i
should
be
shot
as
a
spy
inside
of
a
week
or
doing
solitary
in
the
moabite
prison
but
they
lack
the
larger
vision
they
can
be
bluffed
sir
with
your
approval
i
shall
visit
the
fatherland
as
john
blenkiron
once
a
thorn
in
the
side
of
their
brightest
boys
on
the
other
side
but
it
will
be
a
different
john
i
reckon
he
will
have
experienced
a
change
of
heart
he
will
have
come
to
appreciate
the
great
pure
noble
soul
of
germany
and
he
will
be
sorrowing
for
his
past
like
a
converted
at
a
camp
meeting
he
will
be
a
victim
of
the
meanness
and
perfidy
of
the
british
government
i
am
going
to
have
a
row
with
your
foreign
office
about
my
passport
and
i
am
going
to
speak
harsh
words
about
them
up
and
down
this
metropolis
i
am
going
to
be
shadowed
by
your
sleuths
at
my
port
of
embarkation
and
i
guess
i
shall
run
up
hard
against
the
british
legations
in
scandinavia
by
that
time
our
teutonic
friends
will
have
begun
to
wonder
what
has
happened
to
john
and
to
think
that
maybe
they
have
been
mistaken
in
that
child
so
when
i
get
to
germany
they
will
be
waiting
for
me
with
an
open
mind
then
i
judge
my
conduct
will
surprise
and
encourage
them
i
will
confide
to
them
valuable
secret
information
about
british
preparations
and
i
will
show
up
the
british
lion
as
the
meanest
kind
of
cur
you
may
trust
me
to
make
a
good
impression
after
that
i
move
eastwards
to
see
the
demolition
of
the
british
empire
in
those
parts
by
the
way
where
is
the
is
the
day
of
november
if
we
ca
find
out
what
we
want
in
two
months
we
may
chuck
the
job
on
the
of
january
we
should
forgather
in
constantinople
whoever
gets
there
first
waits
for
the
others
if
by
that
date
we
not
all
present
it
will
be
considered
that
the
missing
man
has
got
into
trouble
and
must
be
given
up
if
ever
we
get
there
we
be
coming
from
different
points
and
in
different
characters
so
we
want
a
rendezvous
where
all
kinds
of
odd
folk
assemble
sandy
you
know
constantinople
you
fix
the
already
thought
of
that
he
said
and
going
to
the
he
drew
a
little
plan
on
a
sheet
of
paper
lane
runs
down
from
the
kurdish
bazaar
in
galata
to
the
ferry
of
ratchik
down
on
the
side
is
a
cafe
kept
by
a
greek
called
kuprasso
behind
the
cafe
is
a
garden
surrounded
by
high
walls
which
were
parts
of
the
old
byzantine
theatre
at
the
end
of
the
garden
is
a
shanty
called
the
of
suliman
the
red
it
has
been
in
its
time
a
and
a
gambling
hell
and
god
knows
what
else
it
not
a
place
for
respectable
people
but
the
ends
of
the
earth
converge
there
and
no
questions
are
asked
that
the
best
spot
i
can
think
of
for
a
the
kettle
was
simmering
by
the
fire
the
night
was
raw
and
it
seemed
the
hour
for
i
made
a
brew
for
sandy
and
myself
and
boiled
some
milk
for
blenkiron
about
language
i
asked
all
right
sandy
know
german
fairly
well
and
i
can
pass
anywhere
as
a
turk
the
first
will
do
for
eavesdropping
and
the
second
for
ordinary
business
you
i
asked
blenkiron
was
left
out
at
pentecost
he
said
regret
to
confess
i
have
no
gift
of
tongues
but
the
part
i
have
chosen
for
myself
do
require
the
polyglot
never
forget
i
plain
john
blenkiron
a
citizen
of
the
great
american
republic
have
told
us
your
own
line
dick
sandy
said
am
going
to
the
bosporus
through
germany
and
not
being
a
neutral
it
wo
be
a
very
cushioned
journey
sandy
looked
grave
sounds
pretty
desperate
is
your
german
good
enough
fair
quite
good
enough
to
pass
as
a
native
but
officially
i
shall
not
understand
one
word
i
shall
be
a
boer
from
western
cape
colony
one
of
maritz
old
lot
who
after
a
bit
of
trouble
has
got
through
angola
and
reached
europe
i
shall
talk
dutch
and
nothing
else
and
my
hat
i
shall
be
pretty
bitter
about
the
british
a
powerful
lot
of
good
in
the
taal
i
shall
know
all
about
africa
and
be
panting
to
get
another
whack
at
the
with
luck
they
may
send
me
to
the
uganda
show
or
to
egypt
and
i
shall
take
care
to
go
by
constantinople
if
i
to
deal
with
the
mohammedan
natives
they
bound
to
show
me
what
hand
they
hold
at
least
the
way
i
look
at
it
we
filled
our
glasses
two
of
punch
and
one
of
milk
and
drank
to
our
next
merry
meeting
then
sandy
began
to
laugh
and
i
joined
in
the
sense
of
hopeless
folly
again
descended
on
me
the
best
plans
we
could
make
were
like
a
few
buckets
of
water
to
ease
the
drought
of
the
sahara
or
the
old
lady
who
would
have
stopped
the
atlantic
with
a
broom
i
thought
with
sympathy
of
little
saint
teresa
chapter
three
peter
pienaar
our
various
departures
were
unassuming
all
but
the
american
sandy
spent
a
busy
fortnight
in
his
subterranean
fashion
now
in
the
british
museum
now
running
about
the
country
to
see
old
exploring
companions
now
at
the
war
office
now
at
the
foreign
office
but
mostly
in
my
flat
sunk
in
an
and
meditating
he
left
finally
on
december
as
a
king
messenger
for
cairo
once
there
i
knew
the
messenger
would
disappear
and
some
queer
oriental
ruffian
take
his
place
it
would
have
been
impertinence
in
me
to
inquire
into
his
plans
he
was
the
real
professional
and
i
was
only
the
dabbler
blenkiron
was
a
different
matter
sir
walter
told
me
to
look
out
for
squalls
and
the
twinkle
in
his
eye
gave
me
a
notion
of
what
was
coming
the
first
thing
the
sportsman
did
was
to
write
a
letter
to
the
papers
signed
with
his
name
there
had
been
a
debate
in
the
house
of
commons
on
foreign
policy
and
the
speech
of
some
idiot
there
gave
him
his
cue
he
declared
that
he
had
been
heart
and
soul
with
the
british
at
the
start
but
that
he
was
reluctantly
compelled
to
change
his
views
he
said
our
blockade
of
germany
had
broken
all
the
laws
of
god
and
humanity
and
he
reckoned
that
britain
was
now
the
worst
exponent
of
prussianism
going
that
letter
made
a
fine
racket
and
the
paper
that
printed
it
had
a
row
with
the
censor
but
that
was
only
the
beginning
of
mr
blenkiron
campaign
he
got
mixed
up
with
some
mountebanks
called
the
league
of
democrats
against
aggression
gentlemen
who
thought
that
germany
was
all
right
if
we
could
only
keep
from
hurting
her
feelings
he
addressed
a
meeting
under
their
auspices
which
was
broken
up
by
the
crowd
but
not
before
john
had
got
off
his
chest
a
lot
of
amazing
stuff
i
was
there
but
a
man
who
was
told
me
that
he
never
heard
such
clotted
nonsense
he
said
that
germany
was
right
in
wanting
the
freedom
of
the
seas
and
that
america
would
back
her
up
and
that
the
british
navy
was
a
bigger
menace
to
the
peace
of
the
world
than
the
kaiser
army
he
admitted
that
he
had
once
thought
differently
but
he
was
an
honest
man
and
not
afraid
to
face
facts
the
oration
closed
suddenly
when
he
got
a
in
the
eye
at
which
my
friend
said
he
swore
in
a
very
unpacifist
style
after
that
he
wrote
other
letters
to
the
press
saying
that
there
was
no
more
liberty
of
speech
in
england
and
a
lot
of
scallywags
backed
him
up
some
americans
wanted
to
tar
and
feather
him
and
he
got
kicked
out
of
the
savoy
there
was
an
agitation
to
get
him
deported
and
questions
were
asked
in
parliament
and
the
for
foreign
affairs
said
his
department
had
the
matter
in
hand
i
was
beginning
to
think
that
blenkiron
was
carrying
his
tomfoolery
too
far
so
i
went
to
see
sir
walter
but
he
told
me
to
keep
my
mind
easy
friend
motto
is
thorough
he
said
he
knows
very
well
what
he
is
about
we
have
officially
requested
him
to
leave
and
he
sails
from
newcastle
on
monday
he
will
be
shadowed
wherever
he
goes
and
we
hope
to
provoke
more
outbreaks
he
is
a
very
capable
fellow
the
last
i
saw
of
him
was
on
the
saturday
afternoon
when
i
met
him
in
st
james
street
and
offered
to
shake
hands
he
told
me
that
my
uniform
was
a
pollution
and
made
a
speech
to
a
small
crowd
about
it
they
hissed
him
and
he
had
to
get
into
a
taxi
as
he
departed
there
was
just
the
suspicion
of
a
wink
in
his
left
eye
on
monday
i
read
that
he
had
gone
off
and
the
papers
observed
that
our
shores
were
well
quit
of
him
i
sailed
on
december
from
liverpool
in
a
boat
bound
for
the
argentine
that
was
due
to
put
in
at
lisbon
i
had
of
course
to
get
a
foreign
office
passport
to
leave
england
but
after
that
my
connection
with
the
government
ceased
all
the
details
of
my
journey
were
carefully
thought
out
lisbon
would
be
a
good
place
for
it
was
the
rendezvous
of
scallywags
from
most
parts
of
africa
my
kit
was
an
old
gladstone
bag
and
my
clothes
were
the
relics
of
my
south
african
wardrobe
i
let
my
beard
grow
for
some
days
before
i
sailed
and
since
it
grows
fast
i
went
on
board
with
the
kind
of
hairy
chin
you
will
see
on
the
young
boer
my
name
was
now
brandt
cornelis
brandt
at
least
so
my
passport
said
and
passports
never
lie
there
were
just
two
other
passengers
on
that
beastly
boat
and
they
never
appeared
till
we
were
out
of
the
bay
i
was
pretty
bad
myself
but
managed
to
move
about
all
the
time
for
the
frowst
in
my
cabin
would
have
sickened
a
hippo
the
old
tub
took
two
days
and
a
night
to
waddle
from
ushant
to
finisterre
then
the
weather
changed
and
we
came
out
of
into
something
very
like
summer
the
hills
of
portugal
were
all
blue
and
yellow
like
the
kalahari
and
before
we
made
the
tagus
i
was
beginning
to
forget
i
had
ever
left
rhodesia
there
was
a
dutchman
among
the
sailors
with
whom
i
used
to
patter
the
taal
and
but
for
morning
and
evening
in
broken
english
to
the
captain
that
was
about
all
the
talking
i
did
on
the
cruise
we
dropped
anchor
off
the
quays
of
lisbon
on
a
shiny
blue
morning
pretty
near
warm
enough
to
wear
flannels
i
had
now
got
to
be
very
wary
i
did
not
leave
the
ship
with
the
boat
but
made
a
leisurely
breakfast
then
i
strolled
on
deck
and
there
just
casting
anchor
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
was
another
ship
with
a
blue
and
white
funnel
i
knew
so
well
i
calculated
that
a
month
before
she
had
been
smelling
the
mangrove
swamps
of
angola
nothing
could
better
answer
my
purpose
i
proposed
to
board
her
pretending
i
was
looking
for
a
friend
and
come
on
shore
from
her
so
that
anyone
in
lisbon
who
chose
to
be
curious
would
think
i
had
landed
straight
from
portuguese
africa
i
hailed
one
of
the
adjacent
ruffians
and
got
into
his
rowboat
with
my
kit
we
reached
the
vessel
they
called
her
the
the
just
as
the
first
was
leaving
the
crowd
in
it
were
all
portuguese
which
suited
my
book
but
when
i
went
up
the
ladder
the
first
man
i
met
was
old
peter
pienaar
here
was
a
piece
of
sheer
monumental
luck
peter
had
opened
his
eyes
and
his
mouth
and
had
got
as
far
as
when
i
shut
him
up
i
said
brandt
that
my
name
now
and
do
you
forget
it
who
is
the
captain
here
is
it
still
old
sloggett
said
peter
pulling
himself
together
was
speaking
about
you
yesterday
this
was
better
and
better
i
sent
peter
below
to
get
hold
of
sloggett
and
presently
i
had
a
few
words
with
that
gentleman
in
his
cabin
with
the
door
shut
got
to
enter
my
name
in
the
ship
books
i
came
aboard
at
mossamedes
and
my
name
cornelis
brandt
at
first
sloggett
was
for
objecting
he
said
it
was
a
felony
i
told
him
that
i
dared
say
it
was
but
he
had
got
to
do
it
for
reasons
which
i
could
give
but
which
were
highly
creditable
to
all
parties
in
the
end
he
agreed
and
i
saw
it
done
i
had
a
pull
on
old
sloggett
for
i
had
known
him
ever
since
he
owned
a
dissolute
at
delagoa
bay
then
peter
and
i
went
ashore
and
swaggered
into
lisbon
as
if
we
owned
de
beers
we
put
up
at
the
big
hotel
opposite
the
railway
station
and
looked
and
behaved
like
a
pair
of
lowbred
south
africans
home
for
a
spree
it
was
a
fine
bright
day
so
i
hired
a
and
said
i
would
drive
it
myself
we
asked
the
name
of
some
to
visit
and
were
told
cintra
and
shown
the
road
to
it
i
wanted
a
quiet
place
to
talk
for
i
had
a
good
deal
to
say
to
peter
pienaar
i
christened
that
car
the
lusitanian
terror
and
it
was
a
marvel
that
we
did
not
smash
ourselves
up
there
was
something
immortally
wrong
with
its
steering
gear
half
a
dozen
times
we
slewed
across
the
road
inviting
destruction
but
we
got
there
in
the
end
and
had
luncheon
in
an
hotel
opposite
the
moorish
palace
there
we
left
the
car
and
wandered
up
the
slopes
of
a
hill
where
sitting
among
scrub
very
like
the
veld
i
told
peter
the
situation
of
affairs
but
first
a
word
must
be
said
about
peter
he
was
the
man
that
taught
me
all
i
ever
knew
of
and
a
good
deal
about
human
nature
besides
he
was
out
of
the
old
colony
burgersdorp
i
think
but
he
had
come
to
the
transvaal
when
the
lydenburg
goldfields
started
he
was
prospector
and
hunter
in
turns
but
principally
hunter
in
those
early
days
he
was
none
too
good
a
citizen
he
was
in
swaziland
with
bob
macnab
and
you
know
what
that
means
then
he
took
to
working
off
bogus
gold
propositions
on
kimberley
and
johannesburg
magnates
and
what
he
did
know
about
salting
a
mine
knowledge
after
that
he
was
in
the
kalahari
where
he
and
scotty
smith
were
familiar
names
an
era
of
comparative
respectability
dawned
for
him
with
the
matabele
war
when
he
did
uncommon
good
scouting
and
transport
work
cecil
rhodes
wanted
to
establish
him
on
a
stock
farm
down
salisbury
way
but
peter
was
an
independent
devil
and
would
call
no
man
master
he
took
to
hunting
which
was
what
god
intended
him
for
for
he
could
track
a
tsessebe
in
thick
bush
and
was
far
the
finest
shot
i
have
seen
in
my
life
he
took
parties
to
the
pungwe
flats
and
barotseland
and
up
to
tanganyika
then
he
made
a
speciality
of
the
ngami
region
where
i
once
hunted
with
him
and
he
was
with
me
when
i
went
prospecting
in
damaraland
when
the
boer
war
started
peter
like
many
of
the
very
great
hunters
took
the
british
side
and
did
most
of
our
intelligence
work
in
the
north
transvaal
beyers
would
have
hanged
him
if
he
could
have
caught
him
and
there
was
no
love
lost
between
peter
and
his
own
people
for
many
a
day
when
it
was
all
over
and
things
had
calmed
down
a
bit
he
settled
in
bulawayo
and
used
to
go
with
me
when
i
went
on
trek
at
the
time
when
i
left
africa
two
years
before
i
had
lost
sight
of
him
for
months
and
heard
that
he
was
somewhere
on
the
congo
poaching
elephants
he
had
always
a
great
idea
of
making
things
hum
so
loud
in
angola
that
the
union
government
would
have
to
step
in
and
annex
it
after
rhodes
peter
had
the
biggest
notions
south
of
the
line
he
was
a
man
of
about
five
foot
ten
very
thin
and
active
and
as
strong
as
a
buffalo
he
had
pale
blue
eyes
a
face
as
gentle
as
a
girl
and
a
soft
sleepy
voice
from
his
present
appearance
it
looked
as
if
he
had
been
living
hard
lately
his
clothes
were
of
the
cut
you
might
expect
to
get
at
lobito
bay
he
was
as
lean
as
a
rake
deeply
browned
with
the
sun
and
there
was
a
lot
of
grey
in
his
beard
he
was
years
old
and
used
to
be
taken
for
forty
now
he
looked
about
his
age
i
first
asked
him
what
he
had
been
up
to
since
the
war
began
he
spat
in
the
kaffir
way
he
had
and
said
he
had
been
having
hell
time
got
hung
up
on
the
kafue
he
said
i
heard
from
old
letsitela
that
the
white
men
were
fighting
i
had
a
bright
idea
that
i
might
get
into
german
south
west
from
the
north
you
see
i
knew
that
botha
could
long
keep
out
of
the
war
well
i
got
into
german
territory
all
right
and
then
a
of
an
officer
came
along
and
commandeered
all
my
mules
and
wanted
to
commandeer
me
with
them
for
his
fool
army
he
was
a
very
ugly
man
with
a
yellow
face
peter
filled
a
deep
pipe
from
a
pouch
you
commandeered
i
asked
i
shot
him
not
so
as
to
kill
but
to
wound
badly
it
was
all
right
for
he
fired
first
on
me
got
me
too
in
the
left
shoulder
but
that
was
the
beginning
of
bad
trouble
i
trekked
east
pretty
fast
and
got
over
the
border
among
the
ovamba
i
have
made
many
journeys
but
that
was
the
worst
four
days
i
went
without
water
and
six
without
food
then
by
bad
luck
i
fell
in
with
you
remember
the
chief
he
said
i
owed
him
money
for
cattle
which
i
bought
when
i
came
there
with
carowab
it
was
a
lie
but
he
held
to
it
and
would
give
me
no
transport
so
i
crossed
the
kalahari
on
my
feet
ugh
it
was
as
slow
as
a
vrouw
coming
from
it
took
weeks
and
weeks
and
when
i
came
to
lechwe
kraal
i
heard
that
the
fighting
was
over
and
that
botha
had
conquered
the
germans
that
too
was
a
lie
but
it
deceived
me
and
i
went
north
into
rhodesia
where
i
learned
the
truth
but
by
then
i
judged
the
war
had
gone
too
far
for
me
to
make
any
profit
out
of
it
so
i
went
into
angola
to
look
for
german
refugees
by
that
time
i
was
hating
germans
worse
than
hell
what
did
you
propose
to
do
with
them
i
asked
had
a
notion
they
would
make
trouble
with
the
government
in
those
parts
i
do
specially
love
the
portugoose
but
i
for
him
against
the
germans
every
day
well
there
was
trouble
and
i
had
a
merry
time
for
a
month
or
two
but
by
and
by
it
petered
out
and
i
thought
i
had
better
clear
for
europe
for
south
africa
was
settling
down
just
as
the
big
show
was
getting
really
interesting
so
here
i
am
cornelis
my
old
friend
if
i
shave
my
beard
will
they
let
me
join
the
flying
corps
i
looked
at
peter
sitting
there
smoking
as
imperturbable
as
if
he
had
been
growing
mealies
in
natal
all
his
life
and
had
run
home
for
a
month
holiday
with
his
people
in
peckham
coming
with
me
my
lad
i
said
going
into
germany
peter
showed
no
surprise
in
mind
that
i
do
like
the
germans
was
all
he
said
a
quiet
christian
man
but
i
the
devil
of
a
temper
then
i
told
him
the
story
of
our
mission
and
i
have
got
to
be
maritz
men
we
went
into
angola
and
now
we
trekking
for
the
fatherland
to
get
a
bit
of
our
own
back
from
the
infernal
english
neither
of
us
knows
any
german
publicly
we
better
plan
out
the
fighting
we
were
in
kakamas
will
do
for
one
and
schuit
drift
you
were
a
ngamiland
hunter
before
the
war
they
wo
have
your
so
you
can
tell
any
lie
you
like
i
better
be
an
educated
afrikander
one
of
beyers
bright
lads
and
a
pal
of
old
hertzog
we
can
let
our
imagination
loose
about
that
part
but
we
must
stick
to
the
same
yarn
about
the
fighting
cornelis
said
peter
he
had
called
me
cornelis
ever
since
i
had
told
him
my
new
name
he
was
a
wonderful
chap
for
catching
on
to
any
game
after
we
get
into
germany
what
then
there
ca
be
much
difficulty
about
the
beginning
but
once
we
among
the
i
do
quite
see
our
line
we
to
find
out
about
something
that
going
on
in
turkey
when
i
was
a
boy
the
predikant
used
to
preach
about
turkey
i
wish
i
was
better
educated
and
remembered
whereabouts
in
the
map
it
was
leave
that
to
me
i
said
explain
it
all
to
you
before
we
get
there
we
have
got
much
of
a
spoor
but
we
cast
about
and
with
luck
will
pick
it
up
i
seen
you
do
it
often
enough
when
we
hunted
kudu
on
the
kafue
peter
nodded
we
sit
still
in
a
german
town
he
asked
anxiously
should
like
that
cornelis
move
gently
eastward
to
constantinople
i
said
peter
grinned
should
cover
a
lot
of
new
country
you
can
reckon
on
me
friend
cornelis
i
always
had
a
hankering
to
see
europe
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
stretched
his
long
arms
better
begin
at
once
god
i
wonder
what
happened
to
old
solly
maritz
with
his
bottle
face
yon
was
a
fine
battle
at
the
drift
when
i
was
sitting
up
to
my
neck
in
the
orange
praying
that
brits
lads
would
take
my
head
for
a
stone
peter
was
as
thorough
a
mountebank
when
he
got
started
as
blenkiron
himself
all
the
way
back
to
lisbon
he
yarned
about
maritz
and
his
adventures
in
german
south
west
till
i
half
believed
they
were
true
he
made
a
very
good
story
of
our
doings
and
by
his
constant
harping
on
it
i
pretty
soon
got
it
into
my
memory
that
was
always
peter
way
he
said
if
you
were
going
to
play
a
part
you
must
think
yourself
into
it
convince
yourself
that
you
were
it
till
you
really
were
it
and
did
act
but
behaved
naturally
the
two
men
who
had
started
that
morning
from
the
hotel
door
had
been
bogus
enough
but
the
two
men
that
returned
were
genuine
desperadoes
itching
to
get
a
shot
at
england
we
spent
the
evening
piling
up
evidence
in
our
favour
some
kind
of
republic
had
been
started
in
portugal
and
ordinarily
the
cafes
would
have
been
full
of
politicians
but
the
war
had
quieted
all
these
local
squabbles
and
the
talk
was
of
nothing
but
what
was
doing
in
france
and
russia
the
place
we
went
to
was
a
big
show
on
a
main
street
and
there
were
a
lot
of
fellows
wandering
about
that
i
guessed
were
spies
and
police
agents
i
knew
that
britain
was
the
one
country
that
does
bother
about
this
kind
of
game
and
that
it
would
be
safe
enough
to
let
ourselves
go
i
talked
portuguese
fairly
well
and
peter
spoke
it
like
a
lourenco
marques
with
a
lot
of
shangaan
words
to
fill
up
he
started
on
curacao
which
i
reckoned
was
a
new
drink
to
him
and
presently
his
tongue
ran
freely
several
neighbours
pricked
up
their
ears
and
soon
we
had
a
small
crowd
round
our
table
we
talked
to
each
other
of
maritz
and
our
doings
it
did
seem
to
be
a
popular
subject
in
that
cafe
one
big
fellow
said
that
maritz
was
a
dirty
swine
who
would
soon
be
hanged
peter
quickly
caught
his
with
one
hand
and
his
throat
with
the
other
and
demanded
an
apology
he
got
it
the
lisbon
have
not
lost
any
lions
after
that
there
was
a
bit
of
a
squash
in
our
corner
those
near
to
us
were
very
quiet
and
polite
but
the
outer
fringe
made
remarks
when
peter
said
that
if
portugal
which
he
admitted
he
loved
was
going
to
stick
to
england
she
was
backing
the
wrong
horse
there
was
a
murmur
of
disapproval
one
old
fellow
who
had
the
air
of
a
ship
captain
flushed
all
over
his
honest
face
and
stood
up
looking
straight
at
peter
i
saw
that
we
had
struck
an
englishman
and
mentioned
it
to
peter
in
dutch
peter
played
his
part
perfectly
he
suddenly
shut
up
and
with
furtive
looks
around
him
began
to
jabber
to
me
in
a
low
voice
he
was
the
very
picture
of
the
old
stage
conspirator
the
old
fellow
stood
staring
at
us
do
very
well
understand
this
damned
lingo
he
said
if
so
be
you
dirty
dutchmen
are
anything
against
england
i
ask
you
to
repeat
it
and
if
so
be
as
you
repeats
it
i
take
either
of
you
on
and
knock
the
face
off
him
he
was
a
chap
after
my
own
heart
but
i
had
to
keep
the
game
up
i
said
in
dutch
to
peter
that
we
must
get
brawling
in
a
public
house
the
big
thing
i
said
darkly
peter
nodded
and
the
old
fellow
after
staring
at
us
for
a
bit
spat
scornfully
and
walked
out
time
is
coming
when
the
englander
will
sing
small
i
observed
to
the
crowd
we
stood
drinks
to
one
or
two
and
then
swaggered
into
the
street
at
the
door
a
hand
touched
my
arm
and
looking
down
i
saw
a
little
scrap
of
a
man
in
a
fur
coat
the
gentlemen
walk
a
step
with
me
and
drink
a
glass
of
beer
he
said
in
very
stiff
dutch
the
devil
are
you
i
asked
strafe
england
was
his
answer
and
turning
back
the
lapel
of
his
coat
he
showed
some
kind
of
ribbon
in
his
buttonhole
said
peter
on
friend
we
do
mind
if
we
do
he
led
us
to
a
back
street
and
then
up
two
pairs
of
stairs
to
a
very
snug
little
flat
the
place
was
filled
with
fine
red
lacquer
and
i
guessed
that
was
his
nominal
business
portugal
since
the
republic
broke
up
the
convents
and
sold
up
the
big
royalist
grandees
was
full
of
bargains
in
the
lacquer
and
curio
line
he
filled
us
two
long
tankards
of
very
good
munich
beer
he
said
raising
his
glass
are
from
south
africa
what
make
you
in
europe
we
both
looked
sullen
and
secretive
our
own
business
i
answered
do
expect
to
buy
our
confidence
with
a
glass
of
beer
he
said
i
will
put
it
differently
from
your
speech
in
the
cafe
i
judge
you
do
not
love
the
english
peter
said
something
about
stamping
on
their
grandmothers
a
kaffir
phrase
which
sounded
gruesome
in
dutch
the
man
laughed
is
all
i
want
to
know
you
are
on
the
german
side
remains
to
be
seen
i
said
they
treat
me
fair
i
fight
for
them
or
for
anybody
else
that
makes
war
on
england
england
has
stolen
my
country
and
corrupted
my
people
and
made
me
an
exile
we
afrikanders
do
not
forget
we
may
be
slow
but
we
win
in
the
end
we
two
are
men
worth
a
great
price
germany
fights
england
in
east
africa
we
know
the
natives
as
no
englishmen
can
ever
know
them
they
are
too
soft
and
easy
and
the
kaffirs
laugh
at
them
but
we
can
handle
the
blacks
so
that
they
will
fight
like
devils
for
fear
of
us
what
is
the
reward
little
man
for
our
services
i
will
tell
you
there
will
be
no
reward
we
ask
none
we
fight
for
hate
of
england
peter
grunted
a
deep
approval
is
good
talk
said
our
entertainer
and
his
eyes
flashed
is
room
in
germany
for
such
men
as
you
where
are
you
going
now
i
beg
to
know
holland
i
said
maybe
we
will
go
to
germany
we
are
tired
with
travel
and
may
rest
a
bit
this
war
will
last
long
and
our
chance
will
come
you
may
miss
your
market
he
said
significantly
ship
sails
tomorrow
for
rotterdam
if
you
take
my
advice
you
will
go
with
her
this
was
what
i
wanted
for
if
we
stayed
in
lisbon
some
real
soldier
of
maritz
might
drop
in
any
day
and
blow
the
gaff
recommend
you
to
sail
in
the
he
repeated
is
work
for
you
in
germany
oh
yes
much
work
but
if
you
delay
the
chance
may
pass
i
will
arrange
your
journey
it
is
my
business
to
help
the
allies
of
my
fatherland
he
wrote
down
our
names
and
an
epitome
of
our
doings
contributed
by
peter
who
required
two
mugs
of
beer
to
help
him
through
he
was
a
bavarian
it
seemed
and
we
drank
to
the
health
of
prince
rupprecht
the
same
blighter
i
was
trying
to
do
in
at
loos
that
was
an
irony
which
peter
unfortunately
could
not
appreciate
if
he
could
he
would
have
enjoyed
it
the
little
chap
saw
us
back
to
our
hotel
and
was
with
us
the
next
morning
after
breakfast
bringing
the
steamer
tickets
we
got
on
board
about
two
in
the
afternoon
but
on
my
advice
he
did
not
see
us
off
i
told
him
that
being
british
subjects
and
rebels
at
that
we
did
not
want
to
run
any
risks
on
board
assuming
a
british
cruiser
caught
us
up
and
searched
us
but
peter
took
twenty
pounds
off
him
for
travelling
expenses
it
being
his
rule
never
to
miss
an
opportunity
of
spoiling
the
egyptians
as
we
were
dropping
down
the
tagus
we
passed
the
old
the
met
sloggett
in
the
street
this
morning
said
peter
he
told
me
a
little
german
man
had
been
off
in
a
boat
at
daybreak
looking
up
the
passenger
list
yon
was
a
right
notion
of
yours
cornelis
i
am
glad
we
are
going
among
germans
they
are
careful
people
whom
it
is
a
pleasure
to
meet
chapter
four
adventures
of
two
dutchmen
on
the
loose
the
germans
as
peter
said
are
a
careful
people
a
man
met
us
on
the
quay
at
rotterdam
i
was
a
bit
afraid
that
something
might
have
turned
up
in
lisbon
to
discredit
us
and
that
our
little
friend
might
have
warned
his
pals
by
telegram
but
apparently
all
was
serene
peter
and
i
had
made
our
plans
pretty
carefully
on
the
voyage
we
had
talked
nothing
but
dutch
and
had
kept
up
between
ourselves
the
role
of
maritz
men
which
peter
said
was
the
only
way
to
play
a
part
well
upon
my
soul
before
we
got
to
holland
i
was
not
very
clear
in
my
own
mind
what
my
past
had
been
indeed
the
danger
was
that
the
other
side
of
my
mind
which
should
be
busy
with
the
great
problem
would
get
atrophied
and
that
i
should
soon
be
mentally
on
a
par
with
the
ordinary
backveld
desperado
we
had
agreed
that
it
would
be
best
to
get
into
germany
at
once
and
when
the
agent
on
the
quay
told
us
of
a
train
at
midday
we
decided
to
take
it
i
had
another
fit
of
cold
feet
before
we
got
over
the
frontier
at
the
station
there
was
a
king
messenger
whom
i
had
seen
in
france
and
a
war
correspondent
who
had
been
trotting
round
our
part
of
the
front
before
loos
i
heard
a
woman
speaking
pretty
english
which
amid
the
hoarse
dutch
jabber
sounded
like
a
lark
among
crows
there
were
copies
of
the
english
papers
for
sale
and
english
cheap
editions
i
felt
pretty
bad
about
the
whole
business
and
wondered
if
i
should
ever
see
these
homely
sights
again
but
the
mood
passed
when
the
train
started
it
was
a
clear
blowing
day
and
as
we
crawled
through
the
flat
pastures
of
holland
my
time
was
taken
up
answering
peter
questions
he
had
never
been
in
europe
before
and
formed
a
high
opinion
of
the
farming
he
said
he
reckoned
that
such
land
would
carry
four
sheep
a
morgen
we
were
thick
in
talk
when
we
reached
the
frontier
station
and
jolted
over
a
canal
bridge
into
germany
i
had
expected
a
big
barricade
with
barbed
wire
and
entrenchments
but
there
was
nothing
to
see
on
the
german
side
but
half
a
dozen
sentries
in
the
i
had
hunted
at
loos
an
with
the
button
of
the
landsturm
hoicked
us
out
of
the
train
and
we
were
all
shepherded
into
a
big
bare
where
a
large
stove
burned
they
took
us
two
at
a
time
into
an
inner
room
for
examination
i
had
explained
to
peter
all
about
this
formality
but
i
was
glad
we
went
in
together
for
they
made
us
strip
to
the
skin
and
i
had
to
curse
him
pretty
seriously
to
make
him
keep
quiet
the
men
who
did
the
job
were
fairly
civil
but
they
were
mighty
thorough
they
took
down
a
list
of
all
we
had
in
our
pockets
and
bags
and
all
the
details
from
the
passports
the
rotterdam
agent
had
given
us
we
were
dressing
when
a
man
in
a
lieutenant
uniform
came
in
with
a
paper
in
his
hand
he
was
a
lad
of
about
twenty
with
spectacled
eyes
brandt
he
called
out
i
nodded
this
is
herr
pienaar
he
asked
in
dutch
he
saluted
i
apologize
i
am
late
because
of
the
slowness
of
the
herr
commandant
had
i
been
in
time
you
would
not
have
been
required
to
go
through
this
ceremony
we
have
been
advised
of
your
coming
and
i
am
instructed
to
attend
you
on
your
journey
the
train
for
berlin
leaves
in
half
an
hour
pray
do
me
the
honour
to
join
me
in
a
bock
with
a
feeling
of
distinction
we
stalked
out
of
the
ordinary
ruck
of
passengers
and
followed
the
lieutenant
to
the
station
restaurant
he
plunged
at
once
into
conversation
talking
the
dutch
of
holland
which
peter
who
had
forgotten
his
found
a
bit
hard
to
follow
he
was
unfit
for
active
service
because
of
his
eyes
and
a
weak
heart
but
he
was
a
desperate
in
that
stuffy
restaurant
by
his
way
of
it
germany
could
gobble
up
the
french
and
the
russians
whenever
she
cared
but
she
was
aiming
at
getting
all
the
middle
east
in
her
hands
first
so
that
she
could
come
out
conqueror
with
the
practical
control
of
half
the
world
friends
the
english
he
said
grinning
come
last
when
we
have
starved
them
and
destroyed
their
commerce
with
our
boats
we
will
show
them
what
our
navy
can
do
for
a
year
they
have
been
wasting
their
time
in
brag
and
politics
and
we
have
been
building
great
ships
oh
so
many
my
cousin
at
kiel
and
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
but
we
never
heard
about
that
cousin
at
kiel
a
short
sunburnt
man
came
in
and
our
friend
sprang
up
and
saluted
clicking
his
heels
like
a
pair
of
tongs
are
the
south
african
dutch
herr
captain
he
said
the
looked
us
over
with
bright
intelligent
eyes
and
started
questioning
peter
in
the
taal
it
was
well
that
we
had
taken
some
pains
with
our
story
for
this
man
had
been
years
in
german
south
west
and
knew
every
mile
of
the
borders
zorn
was
his
name
and
both
peter
and
i
thought
we
remembered
hearing
him
spoken
of
i
am
thankful
to
say
that
we
both
showed
up
pretty
well
peter
told
his
story
to
perfection
not
pitching
it
too
high
and
asking
me
now
and
then
for
a
name
or
to
verify
some
detail
captain
zorn
looked
satisfied
seem
the
right
kind
of
fellows
he
said
remember
and
he
bent
his
brows
on
us
do
not
understand
slimness
in
this
land
if
you
are
honest
you
will
be
rewarded
but
if
you
dare
to
play
a
double
game
you
will
be
shot
like
dogs
your
race
has
produced
over
many
traitors
for
my
taste
ask
no
reward
i
said
gruffly
are
not
germans
or
slaves
but
so
long
as
she
fights
against
england
we
will
fight
for
her
words
he
said
you
must
bow
your
stiff
necks
to
discipline
first
discipline
has
been
the
weak
point
of
you
boers
and
you
have
suffered
for
it
you
are
no
more
a
nation
in
germany
we
put
discipline
first
and
last
and
therefore
we
will
conquer
the
world
off
with
you
now
your
train
starts
in
three
minutes
we
will
see
what
von
stumm
will
make
of
you
that
fellow
gave
me
the
best
of
any
german
i
had
yet
met
he
was
a
white
man
and
i
could
have
worked
with
him
i
liked
his
stiff
chin
and
steady
blue
eyes
my
chief
recollection
of
our
journey
to
berlin
was
its
commonplaceness
the
spectacled
lieutenant
fell
asleep
and
for
the
most
part
we
had
the
carriage
to
ourselves
now
and
again
a
soldier
on
leave
would
drop
in
most
of
them
tired
men
with
heavy
eyes
no
wonder
poor
devils
for
they
were
coming
back
from
the
yser
or
the
ypres
salient
i
would
have
liked
to
talk
to
them
but
officially
of
course
i
knew
no
german
and
the
conversation
i
overheard
did
not
signify
much
it
was
mostly
about
regimental
details
though
one
chap
who
was
in
better
spirits
than
the
rest
observed
that
this
was
the
last
christmas
of
misery
and
that
next
year
he
would
be
holidaying
at
home
with
full
pockets
the
others
assented
but
without
much
conviction
the
winter
day
was
short
and
most
of
the
journey
was
made
in
the
dark
i
could
see
from
the
window
the
lights
of
little
villages
and
now
and
then
the
blaze
of
ironworks
and
forges
we
stopped
at
a
town
for
dinner
where
the
platform
was
crowded
with
drafts
waiting
to
go
westward
we
saw
no
signs
of
any
scarcity
of
food
such
as
the
english
newspapers
wrote
about
we
had
an
excellent
dinner
at
the
station
restaurant
which
with
a
bottle
of
white
wine
cost
just
three
shillings
apiece
the
bread
to
be
sure
was
poor
but
i
can
put
up
with
the
absence
of
bread
if
i
get
a
juicy
fillet
of
beef
and
as
good
vegetables
as
you
will
see
in
the
savoy
i
was
a
little
afraid
of
our
giving
ourselves
away
in
our
sleep
but
i
need
have
had
no
fear
for
our
escort
slumbered
like
a
hog
with
his
mouth
wide
open
as
we
roared
through
the
darkness
i
kept
pinching
myself
to
make
myself
feel
that
i
was
in
the
enemy
land
on
a
wild
mission
the
rain
came
on
and
we
passed
through
dripping
towns
with
the
lights
shining
from
the
wet
streets
as
we
went
eastward
the
lighting
seemed
to
grow
more
generous
after
the
murk
of
london
it
was
queer
to
slip
through
garish
stations
with
a
hundred
arc
lights
glowing
and
to
see
long
lines
of
lamps
running
to
the
horizon
peter
dropped
off
early
but
i
kept
awake
till
midnight
trying
to
focus
thoughts
that
persistently
strayed
then
i
too
dozed
and
did
not
awake
till
about
five
in
the
morning
when
we
ran
into
a
great
busy
terminus
as
bright
as
midday
it
was
the
easiest
and
most
unsuspicious
journey
i
ever
made
the
lieutenant
stretched
himself
and
smoothed
his
rumpled
uniform
we
carried
our
scanty
luggage
to
a
for
there
seemed
to
be
no
porters
our
escort
gave
the
address
of
some
hotel
and
we
rumbled
out
into
brightly
lit
empty
streets
mighty
dorp
said
peter
a
truth
the
germans
are
a
great
people
the
lieutenant
nodded
greatest
people
on
earth
he
said
their
enemies
will
soon
bear
witness
i
would
have
given
a
lot
for
a
bath
but
i
felt
that
it
would
be
outside
my
part
and
peter
was
not
of
the
washing
persuasion
but
we
had
a
very
good
breakfast
of
coffee
and
eggs
and
then
the
lieutenant
started
on
the
telephone
he
began
by
being
dictatorial
then
he
seemed
to
be
switched
on
to
higher
authorities
for
he
grew
more
polite
and
at
the
end
he
fairly
crawled
he
made
some
arrangements
for
he
informed
us
that
in
the
afternoon
we
would
see
some
fellow
whose
title
he
could
not
translate
into
dutch
i
judged
he
was
a
great
swell
for
his
voice
became
reverential
at
the
mention
of
him
he
took
us
for
a
walk
that
morning
after
peter
and
i
had
attended
to
our
toilets
we
were
an
odd
pair
of
scallywags
to
look
at
but
as
south
african
as
a
bush
both
of
us
had
tweed
suits
grey
flannel
shirts
with
flannel
collars
and
felt
hats
with
broader
brims
than
they
like
in
europe
i
had
brown
boots
peter
a
pair
of
those
abominations
which
the
portuguese
affect
and
which
made
him
hobble
like
a
chinese
lady
he
had
a
scarlet
satin
tie
which
you
could
hear
a
mile
off
my
beard
had
grown
to
quite
a
respectable
length
and
i
trimmed
it
like
general
smuts
peter
was
the
kind
of
loose
flapping
thing
the
loves
which
has
scarcely
ever
been
shaved
and
is
combed
once
in
a
blue
moon
i
must
say
we
made
a
pretty
solid
pair
any
south
african
would
have
set
us
down
as
a
boer
from
the
who
had
bought
a
suit
of
clothes
in
the
nearest
store
and
his
cousin
from
some
dorp
who
had
been
to
school
and
thought
himself
the
devil
of
a
fellow
we
fairly
reeked
of
the
as
the
papers
call
it
it
was
a
fine
morning
after
the
rain
and
we
wandered
about
in
the
streets
for
a
couple
of
hours
they
were
busy
enough
and
the
shops
looked
rich
and
bright
with
their
christmas
goods
and
one
big
store
where
i
went
to
buy
a
was
packed
with
customers
one
did
see
very
many
young
men
and
most
of
the
women
wore
mourning
uniforms
were
everywhere
but
their
wearers
generally
looked
like
or
office
fellows
we
had
a
glimpse
of
the
squat
building
which
housed
the
general
staff
and
took
off
our
hats
to
it
then
we
stared
at
the
marinamt
and
i
wondered
what
plots
were
hatching
there
behind
old
tirpitz
whiskers
the
capital
gave
one
an
impression
of
ugly
cleanness
and
a
sort
of
dreary
effectiveness
and
yet
i
found
it
depressing
more
depressing
than
london
i
do
know
how
to
put
it
but
the
whole
big
concern
seemed
to
have
no
soul
in
it
to
be
like
a
big
factory
instead
of
a
city
you
wo
make
a
factory
look
like
a
house
though
you
decorate
its
front
and
plant
all
round
it
the
place
depressed
and
yet
cheered
me
it
somehow
made
the
german
people
seem
smaller
at
three
the
lieutenant
took
us
to
a
plain
white
building
in
a
side
street
with
sentries
at
the
door
a
young
staff
officer
met
us
and
made
us
wait
for
five
minutes
in
an
then
we
were
ushered
into
a
big
room
with
a
polished
floor
on
which
peter
nearly
sat
down
there
was
a
log
fire
burning
and
seated
at
a
table
was
a
little
man
in
spectacles
with
his
hair
brushed
back
from
his
brow
like
a
popular
violinist
he
was
the
boss
for
the
lieutenant
saluted
him
and
announced
our
names
then
he
disappeared
and
the
man
at
the
table
motioned
us
to
sit
down
in
two
chairs
before
him
brandt
and
herr
pienaar
he
asked
looking
over
his
glasses
but
it
was
the
other
man
that
caught
my
eye
he
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fire
leaning
his
elbows
on
the
mantelpiece
he
was
a
perfect
mountain
of
a
fellow
six
and
a
half
feet
if
he
was
an
inch
with
shoulders
on
him
like
a
shorthorn
bull
he
was
in
uniform
and
the
ribbon
of
the
iron
cross
showed
at
a
buttonhole
his
tunic
was
all
wrinkled
and
strained
as
if
it
could
scarcely
contain
his
huge
chest
and
mighty
hands
were
clasped
over
his
stomach
that
man
must
have
had
the
length
of
reach
of
a
gorilla
he
had
a
great
lazy
smiling
face
with
a
square
cleft
chin
which
stuck
out
beyond
the
rest
his
brow
retreated
and
the
stubby
back
of
his
head
ran
forward
to
meet
it
while
his
neck
below
bulged
out
over
his
collar
his
head
was
exactly
the
shape
of
a
pear
with
the
sharp
end
topmost
he
stared
at
me
with
his
small
bright
eyes
and
i
stared
back
i
had
struck
something
i
had
been
looking
for
for
a
long
time
and
till
that
moment
i
was
sure
that
it
existed
here
was
the
german
of
caricature
the
real
german
the
fellow
we
were
up
against
he
was
as
hideous
as
a
hippopotamus
but
effective
every
bristle
on
his
odd
head
was
effective
the
man
at
the
table
was
speaking
i
took
him
to
be
a
civilian
official
of
sorts
pretty
high
up
from
his
surroundings
perhaps
an
his
dutch
was
slow
and
careful
but
good
too
good
for
peter
he
had
a
paper
before
him
and
was
asking
us
questions
from
it
they
did
not
amount
to
much
being
pretty
well
a
repetition
of
those
zorn
had
asked
us
at
the
frontier
i
answered
fluently
for
i
had
all
our
lies
by
heart
then
the
man
on
the
hearthrug
broke
in
talk
to
them
excellency
he
said
in
german
are
too
academic
for
those
outland
swine
he
began
in
the
with
the
thick
guttural
accent
that
you
get
in
german
south
west
have
heard
of
me
he
said
am
the
colonel
von
stumm
who
fought
the
heraros
peter
pricked
up
his
ears
baas
you
cut
off
the
chief
baviaan
head
and
sent
it
in
pickle
about
the
country
i
have
seen
it
the
big
man
laughed
see
i
am
not
forgotten
he
said
to
his
friend
and
then
to
us
i
treat
my
enemies
and
so
will
germany
treat
hers
you
too
if
you
fail
me
by
a
fraction
of
an
inch
and
he
laughed
loud
again
there
was
something
horrible
in
that
boisterousness
peter
was
watching
him
from
below
his
eyelids
as
i
have
seen
him
watch
a
lion
about
to
charge
he
flung
himself
on
a
chair
put
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
thrust
his
face
forward
have
come
from
a
damned
muddled
show
if
i
had
maritz
in
my
power
i
would
have
him
flogged
at
a
wagon
end
fools
and
they
had
the
game
in
their
hands
and
they
flung
it
away
we
could
have
raised
a
fire
that
would
have
burned
the
english
into
the
sea
and
for
lack
of
fuel
they
let
it
die
down
then
they
try
to
fan
it
when
the
ashes
are
cold
he
rolled
a
paper
pellet
and
flicked
it
into
the
air
is
what
i
think
of
your
idiot
general
he
said
of
all
you
dutch
as
slow
as
a
fat
vrouw
and
as
greedy
as
an
aasvogel
we
looked
very
glum
and
sullen
pair
of
dumb
dogs
he
cried
thousand
brandenburgers
would
have
won
in
a
fortnight
seitz
had
much
to
boast
of
mostly
clerks
and
farmers
and
and
no
soldier
worth
the
name
to
lead
them
but
it
took
botha
and
smuts
and
a
dozen
generals
to
hunt
him
down
but
maritz
his
scorn
came
like
a
gust
of
wind
did
all
the
fighting
there
was
said
peter
sulkily
any
rate
he
was
afraid
of
the
sight
of
the
khaki
like
your
lot
he
was
said
the
giant
in
a
cooing
voice
he
had
his
reasons
for
that
you
dutchmen
have
always
a
to
fall
on
you
can
always
turn
traitor
maritz
now
calls
himself
robinson
and
has
a
pension
from
his
friend
botha
said
peter
a
very
damned
lie
asked
for
information
said
stumm
with
a
sudden
politeness
that
is
all
past
and
done
with
maritz
matters
no
more
than
your
old
cronjes
and
krugers
the
show
is
over
and
you
are
looking
for
safety
for
a
new
master
perhaps
but
man
what
can
you
bring
what
can
you
offer
you
and
your
dutch
are
lying
in
the
dust
with
the
yoke
on
your
necks
the
pretoria
lawyers
have
talked
you
round
you
see
that
map
and
he
pointed
to
a
big
one
on
the
wall
africa
is
coloured
green
not
red
for
the
english
or
yellow
for
the
germans
some
day
it
will
be
yellow
but
for
a
little
it
will
be
green
the
colour
of
neutrals
of
nothings
of
boys
and
young
ladies
and
i
kept
wondering
what
he
was
playing
at
then
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
peter
do
you
come
here
for
the
game
up
in
your
own
country
what
can
you
offer
us
germans
if
we
gave
you
ten
million
marks
and
sent
you
back
you
could
do
nothing
stir
up
a
village
row
perhaps
and
shoot
a
policeman
south
africa
is
counted
out
in
this
war
botha
is
a
cleverish
man
and
has
beaten
you
of
rebels
can
you
deny
it
peter
could
he
was
terribly
honest
in
some
things
and
these
were
for
certain
his
opinions
he
said
is
true
baas
what
in
god
name
can
you
do
shouted
stumm
peter
mumbled
some
foolishness
about
nobbling
angola
for
germany
and
starting
a
revolution
among
the
natives
stumm
flung
up
his
arms
and
cursed
and
the
laughed
it
was
high
time
for
me
to
chip
in
i
was
beginning
to
see
the
kind
of
fellow
this
stumm
was
and
as
he
talked
i
thought
of
my
mission
which
had
got
overlaid
by
my
boer
past
it
looked
as
if
he
might
be
useful
me
speak
i
said
friend
is
a
great
hunter
but
he
fights
better
than
he
talks
he
is
no
politician
you
speak
truth
south
africa
is
a
closed
door
for
the
present
and
the
key
to
it
is
elsewhere
here
in
europe
and
in
the
east
and
in
other
parts
of
africa
we
have
come
to
help
you
to
find
the
key
stumm
was
listening
on
my
little
boer
it
will
be
a
new
thing
to
hear
a
on
are
fighting
i
said
east
africa
and
soon
you
may
fight
in
egypt
all
the
east
coast
north
of
the
zambesi
will
be
your
the
english
run
about
the
world
with
little
expeditions
i
do
not
know
where
the
places
are
though
i
read
of
them
in
the
papers
but
i
know
my
africa
you
want
to
beat
them
here
in
europe
and
on
the
seas
therefore
like
wise
generals
you
try
to
divide
them
and
have
them
scattered
throughout
the
globe
while
you
stick
at
home
that
is
your
plan
second
falkenhayn
said
stumm
laughing
england
will
not
let
east
africa
go
she
fears
for
egypt
and
she
fears
too
for
india
if
you
press
her
there
she
will
send
armies
and
more
armies
till
she
is
so
weak
in
europe
that
a
child
can
crush
her
that
is
england
way
she
cares
more
for
her
empire
than
for
what
may
happen
to
her
allies
so
i
say
press
and
still
press
there
destroy
the
railway
to
the
lakes
burn
her
capital
pen
up
every
englishman
in
mombasa
island
at
this
moment
it
is
worth
for
you
a
thousand
damaralands
the
man
was
really
interested
and
the
too
pricked
up
his
ears
can
keep
our
territory
said
the
former
as
for
pressing
how
the
devil
are
we
to
press
the
accursed
english
hold
the
sea
we
can
not
ship
men
or
guns
there
south
are
the
portuguese
and
west
the
belgians
you
can
not
move
a
mass
without
a
lever
lever
is
there
ready
for
you
i
said
for
god
sake
show
it
me
he
cried
i
looked
at
the
door
to
see
that
it
was
shut
as
if
what
i
had
to
say
was
very
secret
need
men
and
the
men
are
waiting
they
are
black
but
they
are
the
stuff
of
warriors
all
round
your
borders
you
have
the
remains
of
great
fighting
tribes
the
angoni
the
masai
the
manyumwezi
and
above
all
the
somalis
of
the
north
and
the
dwellers
on
the
upper
nile
the
british
recruit
their
black
regiments
there
and
so
do
you
but
to
get
recruits
is
not
enough
you
must
set
whole
nations
moving
as
the
zulu
under
tchaka
flowed
over
south
africa
can
not
be
done
said
the
can
be
done
i
said
quietly
two
are
here
to
do
it
this
kind
of
talk
was
jolly
difficult
for
me
chiefly
because
of
stumm
asides
in
german
to
the
official
i
had
above
all
things
to
get
the
credit
of
knowing
no
german
and
if
you
understand
a
language
well
it
is
not
very
easy
when
you
are
interrupted
not
to
show
that
you
know
it
either
by
a
direct
answer
or
by
referring
to
the
interruption
in
what
you
say
next
i
had
to
be
always
on
my
guard
and
yet
it
was
up
to
me
to
be
very
persuasive
and
convince
these
fellows
that
i
would
be
useful
somehow
or
other
i
had
to
get
into
their
confidence
have
been
for
years
up
and
down
in
africa
uganda
and
the
congo
and
the
upper
nile
i
know
the
ways
of
the
kaffir
as
no
englishman
does
we
afrikanders
see
into
the
black
man
heart
and
though
he
may
hate
us
he
does
our
will
you
germans
are
like
the
english
you
are
too
big
folk
to
understand
plain
men
civilize
you
cry
educate
say
the
english
the
black
man
obeys
and
puts
away
his
gods
but
he
worships
them
all
the
time
in
his
soul
we
must
get
his
gods
on
our
side
and
then
he
will
move
mountains
we
must
do
as
john
laputa
did
with
sheba
necklace
all
in
the
air
said
stumm
but
he
did
not
laugh
is
sober
common
sense
i
said
you
must
begin
at
the
right
end
first
find
the
race
that
fears
its
priests
it
is
waiting
for
you
the
mussulmans
of
somaliland
and
the
abyssinian
border
and
the
blue
and
white
nile
they
would
be
like
dried
grasses
to
catch
fire
if
you
used
the
flint
and
steel
of
their
religion
look
what
the
english
suffered
from
a
crazy
mullah
who
ruled
only
a
dozen
villages
once
get
the
flames
going
and
they
will
lick
up
the
pagans
of
the
west
and
south
this
is
the
way
of
africa
how
many
thousands
think
you
were
in
the
mahdi
army
who
never
heard
of
the
prophet
till
they
saw
the
black
flags
of
the
emirs
going
into
battle
stumm
was
smiling
he
turned
his
face
to
the
official
and
spoke
with
his
hand
over
his
mouth
but
i
caught
his
words
they
were
is
the
man
for
hilda
the
other
pursed
his
lips
and
looked
a
little
scared
stumm
rang
a
bell
and
the
lieutenant
came
in
and
clicked
his
heels
he
nodded
towards
peter
this
man
away
with
you
we
have
done
with
him
the
other
fellow
will
follow
presently
peter
went
out
with
a
puzzled
face
and
stumm
turned
to
me
are
a
dreamer
brandt
he
said
i
do
not
reject
you
on
that
account
dreams
sometimes
come
true
when
an
army
follows
the
visionary
but
who
is
going
to
kindle
the
flame
i
said
the
devil
do
you
mean
he
asked
is
your
part
you
are
the
cleverest
people
in
the
world
you
have
already
half
the
mussulman
lands
in
your
power
it
is
for
you
to
show
us
how
to
kindle
a
holy
war
for
clearly
you
have
the
secret
of
it
never
fear
but
we
will
carry
out
your
order
have
no
secret
he
said
shortly
and
glanced
at
the
official
who
stared
out
of
the
window
i
dropped
my
jaw
and
looked
the
picture
of
disappointment
do
not
believe
you
i
said
slowly
play
a
game
with
me
i
have
not
come
six
thousand
miles
to
be
made
a
fool
of
by
god
stumm
cried
is
none
of
your
ragged
commandos
in
two
strides
he
was
above
me
and
had
lifted
me
out
of
my
seat
his
great
hands
clutched
my
shoulders
and
his
thumbs
gouged
my
armpits
i
felt
as
if
i
were
in
the
grip
of
a
big
ape
then
very
slowly
he
shook
me
so
that
my
teeth
seemed
loosened
and
my
head
swam
he
let
me
go
and
i
dropped
limply
back
in
the
chair
go
and
remember
that
i
am
your
master
i
ulric
von
stumm
who
owns
you
as
a
kaffir
owns
his
mongrel
germany
may
have
some
use
for
you
my
friend
when
you
fear
me
as
you
never
feared
your
god
as
i
walked
dizzily
away
the
big
man
was
smiling
in
his
horrible
way
and
that
little
official
was
blinking
and
smiling
too
i
had
struck
a
dashed
queer
country
so
queer
that
i
had
had
no
time
to
remember
that
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
had
been
bullied
without
hitting
back
when
i
realized
it
i
nearly
choked
with
anger
but
i
thanked
heaven
i
had
shown
no
temper
for
i
remembered
my
mission
luck
seemed
to
have
brought
me
into
useful
company
chapter
five
further
adventures
of
the
same
next
morning
there
was
a
touch
of
frost
and
a
nip
in
the
air
which
stirred
my
blood
and
put
me
in
buoyant
spirits
i
forgot
my
precarious
position
and
the
long
road
i
had
still
to
travel
i
came
down
to
breakfast
in
great
form
to
find
peter
even
temper
badly
ruffled
he
had
remembered
stumm
in
the
night
and
disliked
the
memory
this
he
muttered
to
me
as
we
rubbed
shoulders
at
the
door
peter
and
i
got
no
opportunity
for
private
talk
the
lieutenant
was
with
us
all
the
time
and
at
night
we
were
locked
in
our
rooms
peter
discovered
this
through
trying
to
get
out
to
find
matches
for
he
had
the
bad
habit
of
smoking
in
bed
our
guide
started
on
the
telephone
and
announced
that
we
were
to
be
taken
to
see
a
prisoners
camp
in
the
afternoon
i
was
to
go
somewhere
with
stumm
but
the
morning
was
for
will
see
he
told
us
merciful
is
a
great
people
you
will
also
see
some
of
the
hated
english
in
our
power
that
will
delight
you
they
are
the
forerunners
of
all
their
nation
we
drove
in
a
taxi
through
the
suburbs
and
then
over
a
stretch
of
flat
country
to
a
low
rise
of
wooded
hills
after
an
hour
ride
we
entered
the
gate
of
what
looked
like
a
big
reformatory
or
hospital
i
believe
it
had
been
a
home
for
destitute
children
there
were
sentries
at
the
gate
and
massive
concentric
circles
of
barbed
wire
through
which
we
passed
under
an
arch
that
was
let
down
like
a
portcullis
at
nightfall
the
lieutenant
showed
his
permit
and
we
ran
the
car
into
a
yard
and
marched
through
a
lot
more
sentries
to
the
office
of
the
commandant
he
was
away
from
home
and
we
were
welcomed
by
his
deputy
a
pale
young
man
with
a
head
nearly
bald
there
were
introductions
in
german
which
our
guide
translated
into
dutch
and
a
lot
of
elegant
speeches
about
how
germany
was
foremost
in
humanity
as
well
as
martial
valour
then
they
stood
us
sandwiches
and
beer
and
we
formed
a
procession
for
a
tour
of
inspection
there
were
two
doctors
both
men
in
spectacles
and
a
couple
of
warders
of
the
good
old
burly
bullying
sort
i
knew
well
that
was
the
cement
which
kept
the
german
army
together
her
men
were
nothing
to
boast
of
on
the
average
no
more
were
the
officers
even
in
crack
corps
like
the
guards
and
the
brandenburgers
but
they
seemed
to
have
an
inexhaustible
supply
of
hard
competent
we
marched
round
the
the
the
kitchens
the
hospital
with
nobody
in
it
save
one
chap
with
the
it
did
seem
to
be
badly
done
this
place
was
entirely
for
officers
and
i
expect
it
was
a
show
place
where
american
visitors
were
taken
if
half
the
stories
one
heard
were
true
there
were
some
pretty
ghastly
prisons
away
in
south
and
east
germany
i
did
half
like
the
business
to
be
a
prisoner
has
always
seemed
to
me
about
the
worst
thing
that
could
happen
to
a
man
the
sight
of
german
prisoners
used
to
give
me
a
bad
feeling
inside
whereas
i
looked
at
dead
boches
with
nothing
but
satisfaction
besides
there
was
the
that
i
might
be
recognized
so
i
kept
very
much
in
the
shadow
whenever
we
passed
anybody
in
the
corridors
the
few
we
met
passed
us
incuriously
they
saluted
the
but
scarcely
wasted
a
glance
on
us
no
doubt
they
thought
we
were
inquisitive
germans
come
to
gloat
over
them
they
looked
fairly
fit
but
a
little
puffy
about
the
eyes
like
men
who
get
too
little
exercise
they
seemed
thin
too
i
expect
the
food
for
all
the
commandant
talk
was
nothing
to
boast
of
in
one
room
people
were
writing
letters
it
was
a
big
place
with
only
a
tiny
stove
to
warm
it
and
the
windows
were
shut
so
that
the
atmosphere
was
a
cold
frowst
in
another
room
a
fellow
was
lecturing
on
something
to
a
dozen
hearers
and
drawing
figures
on
a
blackboard
some
were
in
ordinary
khaki
others
in
any
old
thing
they
could
pick
up
and
most
wore
greatcoats
your
blood
gets
thin
when
you
have
nothing
to
do
but
hope
against
hope
and
think
of
your
pals
and
the
old
days
i
was
moving
along
listening
with
half
an
ear
to
the
prattle
and
the
loud
explanations
of
the
when
i
pitchforked
into
what
might
have
been
the
end
of
my
business
we
were
going
through
a
sort
of
convalescent
room
where
people
were
sitting
who
had
been
in
hospital
it
was
a
big
place
a
little
warmer
than
the
rest
of
the
building
but
still
abominably
fuggy
there
were
about
half
a
dozen
men
in
the
room
reading
and
playing
games
they
looked
at
us
with
eyes
for
a
moment
and
then
returned
to
their
occupations
being
convalescents
i
suppose
they
were
not
expected
to
get
up
and
salute
all
but
one
who
was
playing
patience
at
a
little
table
by
which
we
passed
i
was
feeling
very
bad
about
the
thing
for
i
hated
to
see
these
good
fellows
locked
away
in
this
infernal
german
hole
when
they
might
have
been
giving
the
boche
his
deserts
at
the
front
the
commandant
went
first
with
peter
who
had
developed
a
great
interest
in
prisons
then
came
our
lieutenant
with
one
of
the
doctors
then
a
couple
of
warders
and
then
the
second
doctor
and
myself
i
was
at
the
moment
and
was
last
in
the
queue
the
suddenly
looked
up
and
i
saw
his
face
i
hanged
if
it
was
dolly
riddell
who
was
our
brigade
officer
at
loos
i
had
heard
that
the
germans
had
got
him
when
they
blew
up
a
mine
at
the
quarries
i
had
to
act
pretty
quick
for
his
mouth
was
agape
and
i
saw
he
was
going
to
speak
the
doctor
was
a
yard
ahead
of
me
i
stumbled
and
spilt
his
cards
on
the
floor
then
i
kneeled
to
pick
them
up
and
gripped
his
knee
his
head
bent
to
help
me
and
i
spoke
low
in
his
ear
hannay
all
right
for
god
sake
do
wink
an
eye
i
here
on
a
secret
job
the
doctor
had
turned
to
see
what
was
the
matter
i
got
a
few
more
words
in
up
old
man
we
winning
hands
down
then
i
began
to
talk
excited
dutch
and
finished
the
collection
of
the
cards
dolly
was
playing
his
part
well
smiling
as
if
he
was
amused
by
the
antics
of
a
monkey
the
others
were
coming
back
the
with
an
angry
light
in
his
dull
eye
to
the
prisoners
is
forbidden
he
shouted
i
looked
blankly
at
him
till
the
lieutenant
translated
kind
of
fellow
is
he
said
dolly
in
english
to
the
doctor
spoils
my
game
and
then
jabbers
at
me
officially
i
knew
english
and
that
speech
of
dolly
gave
me
my
cue
i
pretended
to
be
very
angry
with
the
very
damned
englishman
and
went
out
of
the
room
close
by
the
grumbling
like
a
sick
jackal
after
that
i
had
to
act
a
bit
the
last
place
we
visited
was
the
part
where
prisoners
were
kept
as
a
punishment
for
some
breach
of
the
rules
they
looked
cheerless
enough
but
i
pretended
to
gloat
over
the
sight
and
said
so
to
the
lieutenant
who
passed
it
on
to
the
others
i
have
rarely
in
my
life
felt
such
a
cad
on
the
way
home
the
lieutenant
discoursed
a
lot
about
prisoners
and
for
at
one
time
he
had
been
on
duty
at
ruhleben
peter
who
had
been
in
quod
more
than
once
in
his
life
was
deeply
interested
and
kept
on
questioning
him
among
other
things
he
told
us
was
that
they
often
put
bogus
prisoners
among
the
rest
who
acted
as
spies
if
any
plot
to
escape
was
hatched
these
fellows
got
into
it
and
encouraged
it
they
never
interfered
till
the
attempt
was
actually
made
and
then
they
had
them
on
toast
there
was
nothing
the
boche
liked
so
much
as
an
excuse
for
sending
a
poor
devil
to
that
afternoon
peter
and
i
separated
he
was
left
behind
with
the
lieutenant
and
i
was
sent
off
to
the
station
with
my
bag
in
the
company
of
a
landsturm
sergeant
peter
was
very
cross
and
i
did
care
for
the
look
of
things
but
i
brightened
up
when
i
heard
i
was
going
somewhere
with
stumm
if
he
wanted
to
see
me
again
he
must
think
me
of
some
use
and
if
he
was
going
to
use
me
he
was
bound
to
let
me
into
his
game
i
liked
stumm
about
as
much
as
a
dog
likes
a
scorpion
but
i
hankered
for
his
society
at
the
station
platform
where
the
ornament
of
the
landsturm
saved
me
all
the
trouble
about
tickets
i
could
not
see
my
companion
i
stood
waiting
while
a
great
crowd
mostly
of
soldiers
swayed
past
me
and
filled
all
the
front
carriages
an
officer
spoke
to
me
gruffly
and
told
me
to
stand
aside
behind
a
wooden
rail
i
obeyed
and
suddenly
found
stumm
eyes
looking
down
at
me
know
german
he
asked
sharply
dozen
words
i
said
carelessly
been
to
windhuk
and
learned
enough
to
ask
for
my
dinner
peter
my
friend
speaks
it
a
bit
said
stumm
get
into
the
carriage
not
that
one
there
thickhead
i
did
as
i
was
bid
he
followed
and
the
door
was
locked
behind
us
the
precaution
was
needless
for
the
sight
of
stumm
profile
at
the
platform
end
would
have
kept
out
the
most
brazen
i
wondered
if
i
had
woken
up
his
suspicions
i
must
be
on
my
guard
to
show
no
signs
of
intelligence
if
he
suddenly
tried
me
in
german
and
that
would
be
easy
for
i
knew
it
as
well
as
i
knew
dutch
we
moved
into
the
country
but
the
windows
were
blurred
with
frost
and
i
saw
nothing
of
the
landscape
stumm
was
busy
with
papers
and
let
me
alone
i
read
on
a
notice
that
one
was
forbidden
to
smoke
so
to
show
my
ignorance
of
german
i
pulled
out
my
pipe
stumm
raised
his
head
saw
what
i
was
doing
and
gruffly
bade
me
put
it
away
as
if
he
were
an
old
lady
that
disliked
the
smell
of
tobacco
in
half
an
hour
i
got
very
bored
for
i
had
nothing
to
read
and
my
pipe
was
people
passed
now
and
then
in
the
corridors
but
no
one
offered
to
enter
no
doubt
they
saw
the
big
figure
in
uniform
and
thought
he
was
the
deuce
of
a
staff
swell
who
wanted
solitude
i
thought
of
stretching
my
legs
in
the
corridor
and
was
just
getting
up
to
do
it
when
somebody
slid
the
door
back
and
a
big
figure
blocked
the
light
he
was
wearing
a
heavy
ulster
and
a
green
felt
hat
he
saluted
stumm
who
looked
up
angrily
and
smiled
pleasantly
on
us
both
gentlemen
he
said
you
room
in
here
for
a
little
one
i
guess
i
about
smoked
out
of
my
car
by
your
brave
soldiers
gotten
a
delicate
stomach
stumm
had
risen
with
a
brow
of
wrath
and
looked
as
if
he
were
going
to
pitch
the
intruder
off
the
train
then
he
seemed
to
halt
and
collect
himself
and
the
other
face
broke
into
a
friendly
grin
it
colonel
stumm
he
cried
he
pronounced
it
like
the
first
syllable
in
pleased
to
meet
you
again
colonel
i
had
the
honour
of
making
your
acquaintance
at
our
embassy
i
reckon
ambassador
gerard
did
cotton
to
our
conversation
that
night
and
the
plumped
himself
down
in
the
corner
opposite
me
i
had
been
pretty
certain
i
would
run
across
blenkiron
somewhere
in
germany
but
i
did
think
it
would
be
so
soon
there
he
sat
staring
at
me
with
his
full
unseeing
eyes
rolling
out
platitudes
to
stumm
who
was
nearly
bursting
in
his
effort
to
keep
civil
i
looked
moody
and
suspicious
which
i
took
to
be
the
right
line
are
getting
a
bit
dead
at
salonika
said
mr
blenkiron
by
way
of
a
conversational
opening
stumm
pointed
to
a
notice
which
warned
officers
to
refrain
from
discussing
military
operations
with
mixed
company
in
a
railway
carriage
said
blenkiron
ca
read
that
tombstone
language
of
yours
but
i
reckon
that
that
notice
to
trespassers
whatever
it
signifies
do
apply
to
you
and
me
i
take
it
this
gentleman
is
in
your
party
i
sat
and
scowled
fixing
the
american
with
suspicious
eyes
is
a
dutchman
said
stumm
african
dutch
and
he
is
not
happy
for
he
does
like
to
hear
english
spoken
shake
on
that
said
blenkiron
cordially
who
said
i
spoke
english
it
good
american
cheer
up
friend
for
it
is
the
call
that
makes
the
big
wapiti
as
they
say
out
west
in
my
country
i
hate
john
bull
worse
than
a
poison
rattle
the
colonel
can
tell
you
that
i
dare
say
he
could
but
at
that
moment
we
slowed
down
at
a
station
and
stumm
got
up
to
leave
day
to
you
herr
blenkiron
he
cried
over
his
shoulder
you
consider
your
comfort
do
talk
english
to
strange
travellers
they
do
distinguish
between
the
different
brands
i
followed
him
in
a
hurry
but
was
recalled
by
blenkiron
voice
friend
he
shouted
left
your
grip
and
he
handed
me
my
bag
from
the
luggage
rack
but
he
showed
no
sign
of
recognition
and
the
last
i
saw
of
him
was
sitting
sunk
in
a
corner
with
his
head
on
his
chest
as
if
he
were
going
to
sleep
he
was
a
man
who
kept
up
his
parts
well
there
was
a
waiting
one
of
the
grey
military
kind
and
we
started
at
a
terrific
pace
over
bad
forest
roads
stumm
had
put
away
his
papers
in
a
portfolio
and
flung
me
a
few
sentences
on
the
journey
have
made
up
my
mind
about
you
brandt
he
announced
may
be
a
fool
or
a
knave
or
a
good
man
if
you
are
a
knave
we
will
shoot
you
if
i
am
a
fool
i
asked
you
to
the
yser
or
the
dvina
you
will
be
respectable
can
not
do
that
unless
i
consent
i
said
we
he
said
smiling
wickedly
you
are
a
citizen
of
nowhere
technically
you
are
a
rebel
and
the
british
if
you
go
to
them
will
hang
you
supposing
they
have
any
sense
you
are
in
our
power
my
friend
to
do
precisely
what
we
like
with
you
he
was
silent
for
a
second
and
then
he
said
meditatively
i
do
think
you
are
a
fool
you
may
be
a
scoundrel
some
kinds
of
scoundrel
are
useful
enough
other
kinds
are
strung
up
with
a
rope
of
that
we
shall
know
more
soon
if
i
am
a
good
man
will
be
given
a
chance
to
serve
germany
the
proudest
privilege
a
mortal
man
can
have
the
strange
man
said
this
with
a
ringing
sincerity
in
his
voice
that
impressed
me
the
car
swung
out
from
the
trees
into
a
park
lined
with
saplings
and
in
the
twilight
i
saw
before
me
a
biggish
house
like
an
overgrown
swiss
chalet
there
was
a
kind
of
archway
with
a
sham
portcullis
and
a
terrace
with
battlements
which
looked
as
if
they
were
made
of
stucco
we
drew
up
at
a
gothic
front
door
where
a
thin
man
in
a
was
waiting
as
we
moved
into
the
lighted
hall
i
got
a
good
look
at
our
host
he
was
very
lean
and
brown
with
the
stoop
in
the
shoulder
that
one
gets
from
being
constantly
on
horseback
he
had
untidy
grizzled
hair
and
a
ragged
beard
and
a
pair
of
pleasant
brown
eyes
my
colonel
he
said
this
the
friend
you
spoke
of
is
the
dutchman
said
stumm
name
is
brandt
brandt
you
see
before
you
herr
gaudian
i
knew
the
name
of
course
there
were
many
in
my
profession
that
did
he
was
one
of
the
biggest
railway
engineers
in
the
world
the
man
who
had
built
the
baghdad
and
syrian
railways
and
the
new
lines
in
german
east
i
suppose
he
was
about
the
greatest
living
authority
on
tropical
construction
he
knew
the
east
and
he
knew
africa
clearly
i
had
been
brought
down
for
him
to
put
me
through
my
paces
a
blonde
maidservant
took
me
to
my
room
which
had
a
bare
polished
floor
a
stove
and
windows
that
unlike
most
of
the
german
kind
i
had
sampled
seemed
made
to
open
when
i
had
washed
i
descended
to
the
hall
which
was
hung
round
with
trophies
of
travel
like
dervish
jibbahs
and
masai
shields
and
one
or
two
good
buffalo
heads
presently
a
bell
was
rung
stumm
appeared
with
his
host
and
we
went
in
to
supper
i
was
jolly
hungry
and
would
have
made
a
good
meal
if
i
constantly
had
to
keep
jogging
my
wits
the
other
two
talked
in
german
and
when
a
question
was
put
to
me
stumm
translated
the
first
thing
i
had
to
do
was
to
pretend
i
did
know
german
and
look
listlessly
round
the
room
while
they
were
talking
the
second
was
to
miss
not
a
word
for
there
lay
my
chance
the
third
was
to
be
ready
to
answer
questions
at
any
moment
and
to
show
in
the
answering
that
i
had
not
followed
the
previous
conversation
likewise
i
must
not
prove
myself
a
fool
in
these
answers
for
i
had
to
convince
them
that
i
was
useful
it
took
some
doing
and
i
felt
like
a
witness
in
the
box
under
a
stiff
or
a
man
trying
to
play
three
games
of
chess
at
once
i
heard
stumm
telling
gaudian
the
gist
of
my
plan
the
engineer
shook
his
head
late
he
said
should
have
been
done
at
the
beginning
we
neglected
africa
you
know
the
reason
why
stumm
laughed
von
einem
perhaps
but
her
charm
works
well
enough
gaudian
glanced
towards
me
while
i
was
busy
with
an
orange
salad
have
much
to
tell
you
of
that
but
it
can
wait
your
friend
is
right
in
one
thing
uganda
is
a
vital
spot
for
the
english
and
a
blow
there
will
make
their
whole
fabric
shiver
but
how
can
we
strike
they
have
still
the
coast
and
our
supplies
grow
daily
smaller
can
send
no
reinforcements
but
have
we
used
all
the
local
resources
that
is
what
i
can
not
satisfy
myself
about
zimmerman
says
we
have
but
tressler
thinks
differently
and
now
we
have
this
fellow
coming
out
of
the
void
with
a
story
which
confirms
my
doubt
he
seems
to
know
his
job
you
try
him
thereupon
gaudian
set
about
questioning
me
and
his
questions
were
very
thorough
i
knew
just
enough
and
no
more
to
get
through
but
i
think
i
came
out
with
credit
you
see
i
have
a
capacious
memory
and
in
my
time
i
had
met
scores
of
hunters
and
pioneers
and
listened
to
their
yarns
so
i
could
pretend
to
knowledge
of
a
place
even
when
i
been
there
besides
i
had
once
been
on
the
point
of
undertaking
a
job
up
tanganyika
way
and
i
had
got
up
that
pretty
accurately
say
that
with
our
help
you
can
make
trouble
for
the
british
on
the
three
borders
gaudian
asked
at
length
can
spread
the
fire
if
some
one
else
will
kindle
it
i
said
there
are
thousands
of
tribes
with
no
affinities
are
all
african
you
can
bear
me
out
all
african
peoples
are
alike
in
one
thing
they
can
go
mad
and
the
madness
of
one
infects
the
others
the
english
know
this
well
enough
would
you
start
the
fire
he
asked
the
fuel
is
dryest
up
in
the
north
among
the
mussulman
peoples
but
there
you
must
help
me
i
know
nothing
about
islam
and
i
gather
that
you
do
he
asked
of
what
you
have
done
already
i
answered
stumm
had
translated
all
this
time
and
had
given
the
sense
of
my
words
very
fairly
but
with
my
last
answer
he
took
liberties
what
he
gave
was
the
dutchman
thinks
that
we
have
some
big
card
in
dealing
with
the
moslem
world
then
lowering
his
voice
and
raising
his
eyebrows
he
said
some
word
like
the
other
looked
with
a
quick
glance
of
apprehension
at
me
had
better
continue
our
talk
in
private
herr
colonel
he
said
herr
brandt
will
forgive
us
we
will
leave
him
for
a
little
to
entertain
himself
he
pushed
the
towards
me
and
the
two
got
up
and
left
the
room
i
pulled
my
chair
up
to
the
stove
and
would
have
liked
to
drop
off
to
sleep
the
tension
of
the
talk
at
supper
had
made
me
very
tired
i
was
accepted
by
these
men
for
exactly
what
i
professed
to
be
stumm
might
suspect
me
of
being
a
rascal
but
it
was
a
dutch
rascal
but
all
the
same
i
was
skating
on
thin
ice
i
could
not
sink
myself
utterly
in
the
part
for
if
i
did
i
would
get
no
good
out
of
being
there
i
had
to
keep
my
wits
going
all
the
time
and
join
the
appearance
and
manners
of
a
backveld
boer
with
the
mentality
of
a
british
any
moment
the
two
parts
might
clash
and
i
would
be
faced
with
the
most
alert
and
deadly
suspicion
there
would
be
no
mercy
from
stumm
that
large
man
was
beginning
to
fascinate
me
even
though
i
hated
him
gaudian
was
clearly
a
good
fellow
a
white
man
and
a
gentleman
i
could
have
worked
with
him
for
he
belonged
to
my
own
totem
but
the
other
was
an
incarnation
of
all
that
makes
germany
detested
and
yet
he
was
altogether
the
ordinary
german
and
i
could
help
admiring
him
i
noticed
he
neither
smoked
nor
drank
his
grossness
was
apparently
not
in
the
way
of
fleshly
appetites
cruelty
from
all
i
had
heard
of
him
in
german
south
west
was
his
hobby
but
there
were
other
things
in
him
some
of
them
good
and
he
had
that
kind
of
crazy
patriotism
which
becomes
a
religion
i
wondered
why
he
had
not
some
high
command
in
the
field
for
he
had
had
the
name
of
a
good
soldier
but
probably
he
was
a
big
man
in
his
own
line
whatever
it
was
for
the
fellow
had
talked
small
in
his
presence
and
so
great
a
man
as
gaudian
clearly
respected
him
there
must
be
no
lack
of
brains
inside
that
funny
pyramidal
head
as
i
sat
beside
the
stove
i
was
casting
back
to
think
if
i
had
got
the
slightest
clue
to
my
real
job
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
so
far
stumm
had
talked
of
a
von
einem
woman
who
was
interested
in
his
department
perhaps
the
same
woman
as
the
hilda
he
had
mentioned
the
day
before
to
the
there
was
not
much
in
that
she
was
probably
some
minister
or
ambassador
wife
who
had
a
finger
in
high
politics
if
i
could
have
caught
the
word
stumm
had
whispered
to
gaudian
which
made
him
start
and
look
askance
at
me
but
i
had
only
heard
a
gurgle
of
something
like
which
was
any
german
word
that
i
knew
the
heat
put
me
into
a
and
i
began
dreamily
to
wonder
what
other
people
were
doing
where
had
blenkiron
been
posting
to
in
that
train
and
what
was
he
up
to
at
this
moment
he
had
been
hobnobbing
with
ambassadors
and
swells
i
wondered
if
he
had
found
out
anything
what
was
peter
doing
i
fervently
hoped
he
was
behaving
himself
for
i
doubted
if
peter
had
really
tumbled
to
the
delicacy
of
our
job
where
was
sandy
too
as
like
as
not
bucketing
in
the
hold
of
some
greek
coaster
in
the
aegean
then
i
thought
of
my
battalion
somewhere
on
the
line
between
hulluch
and
la
bassee
hammering
at
the
boche
while
i
was
five
hundred
miles
or
so
inside
the
boche
frontier
it
was
a
comic
reflection
so
comic
that
it
woke
me
up
after
trying
in
vain
to
find
a
way
of
stoking
that
stove
for
it
was
a
cold
night
i
got
up
and
walked
about
the
room
there
were
portraits
of
two
decent
old
fellows
probably
gaudian
parents
there
were
enlarged
photographs
too
of
engineering
works
and
a
good
picture
of
bismarck
and
close
to
the
stove
there
was
a
case
of
maps
mounted
on
rollers
i
pulled
out
one
at
random
it
was
a
geological
map
of
germany
and
with
some
trouble
i
found
out
where
i
was
i
was
an
enormous
distance
from
my
goal
and
moreover
i
was
clean
off
the
road
to
the
east
to
go
there
i
must
first
go
to
bavaria
and
then
into
austria
i
noticed
the
danube
flowing
eastwards
and
remembered
that
that
was
one
way
to
constantinople
then
i
tried
another
map
this
one
covered
a
big
area
all
europe
from
the
rhine
and
as
far
east
as
persia
i
guessed
that
it
was
meant
to
show
the
baghdad
railway
and
the
through
routes
from
germany
to
mesopotamia
there
were
markings
on
it
and
as
i
looked
closer
i
saw
that
there
were
dates
scribbled
in
blue
pencil
as
if
to
denote
the
stages
of
a
journey
the
dates
began
in
europe
and
continued
right
on
into
asia
minor
and
then
south
to
syria
for
a
moment
my
heart
jumped
for
i
thought
i
had
fallen
by
accident
on
the
clue
i
wanted
but
i
never
got
that
map
examined
i
heard
footsteps
in
the
corridor
and
very
gently
i
let
the
map
roll
up
and
turned
away
when
the
door
opened
i
was
bending
over
the
stove
trying
to
get
a
light
for
my
pipe
it
was
gaudian
to
bid
me
join
him
and
stumm
in
his
study
on
our
way
there
he
put
a
kindly
hand
on
my
shoulder
i
think
he
thought
i
was
bullied
by
stumm
and
wanted
to
tell
me
that
he
was
my
friend
and
he
had
no
other
language
than
a
pat
on
the
back
the
soldier
was
in
his
old
position
with
his
elbows
on
the
mantelpiece
and
his
formidable
great
jaw
stuck
out
to
me
he
said
gaudian
and
i
are
inclined
to
make
use
of
you
you
may
be
a
charlatan
in
which
case
you
will
be
in
the
devil
of
a
mess
and
have
yourself
to
thank
for
it
if
you
are
a
rogue
you
will
have
little
scope
for
roguery
we
will
see
to
that
if
you
are
a
fool
you
will
yourself
suffer
for
it
but
if
you
are
a
good
man
you
will
have
a
fair
chance
and
if
you
succeed
we
will
not
forget
it
tomorrow
i
go
home
and
you
will
come
with
me
and
get
your
orders
i
made
shift
to
stand
at
attention
and
salute
gaudian
spoke
in
a
pleasant
voice
as
if
he
wanted
to
atone
for
imperiousness
are
men
who
love
our
fatherland
herr
brandt
he
said
are
not
of
that
fatherland
but
at
least
you
hate
its
enemies
therefore
we
are
allies
and
trust
each
other
like
allies
our
victory
is
ordained
by
god
and
we
are
none
of
us
more
than
his
instruments
stumm
translated
in
a
sentence
and
his
voice
was
quite
solemn
he
held
up
his
right
hand
and
so
did
gaudian
like
a
man
taking
an
oath
or
a
parson
blessing
his
congregation
then
i
realized
something
of
the
might
of
germany
she
produced
good
and
bad
cads
and
gentlemen
but
she
could
put
a
bit
of
the
fanatic
into
them
all
chapter
six
the
indiscretions
of
the
same
i
was
standing
stark
naked
next
morning
in
that
icy
bedroom
trying
to
bathe
in
about
a
quart
of
water
when
stumm
entered
he
strode
up
to
me
and
stared
me
in
the
face
i
was
half
a
head
shorter
than
him
to
begin
with
and
a
man
does
not
feel
his
stoutest
when
he
has
no
clothes
so
he
had
the
pull
on
me
every
way
have
reason
to
believe
that
you
are
a
liar
he
growled
i
pulled
the
round
me
for
i
was
shivering
with
cold
and
the
german
idea
of
a
towel
is
a
i
own
i
was
in
a
pretty
blue
funk
liar
he
repeated
and
that
swine
pienaar
with
my
best
effort
at
surliness
i
asked
what
we
had
done
lied
because
you
said
you
know
no
german
apparently
your
friend
knows
enough
to
talk
treason
and
blasphemy
this
gave
me
back
some
heart
told
you
i
knew
a
dozen
words
but
i
told
you
peter
could
talk
it
a
bit
i
told
you
that
yesterday
at
the
station
fervently
i
blessed
my
luck
for
that
casual
remark
he
evidently
remembered
for
his
tone
became
a
trifle
more
civil
are
a
precious
pair
if
one
of
you
is
a
scoundrel
why
not
the
other
take
no
responsibility
for
peter
i
said
i
felt
i
was
a
cad
in
saying
it
but
that
was
the
bargain
we
had
made
at
the
start
have
known
him
for
years
as
a
great
hunter
and
a
brave
man
i
knew
he
fought
well
against
the
english
but
more
i
can
not
tell
you
you
have
to
judge
him
for
yourself
what
has
he
done
i
was
told
for
stumm
had
got
it
that
morning
on
the
telephone
while
telling
it
he
was
kind
enough
to
allow
me
to
put
on
my
trousers
it
was
just
the
sort
of
thing
i
might
have
foreseen
peter
left
alone
had
become
first
bored
and
then
reckless
he
had
persuaded
the
lieutenant
to
take
him
out
to
supper
at
a
big
berlin
restaurant
there
inspired
by
the
lights
and
music
novel
things
for
a
backveld
hunter
and
no
doubt
bored
stiff
by
his
company
he
had
proceeded
to
get
drunk
that
had
happened
in
my
experience
with
peter
about
once
in
every
three
years
and
it
always
happened
for
the
same
reason
peter
bored
and
solitary
in
a
town
went
on
the
spree
he
had
a
head
like
a
rock
but
he
got
to
the
required
condition
by
wild
mixing
he
was
quite
a
gentleman
in
his
cups
and
not
in
the
least
violent
but
he
was
apt
to
be
very
free
with
his
tongue
and
that
was
what
occurred
at
the
franciscana
he
had
begun
by
insulting
the
emperor
it
seemed
he
drank
his
health
but
said
he
reminded
him
of
a
and
thereby
scarified
the
lieutenant
soul
then
an
officer
some
tremendous
swell
at
an
adjoining
table
had
objected
to
his
talking
so
loud
and
peter
had
replied
insolently
in
respectable
german
after
that
things
became
mixed
there
was
some
kind
of
a
fight
during
which
peter
calumniated
the
german
army
and
all
its
female
ancestry
how
he
was
shot
or
run
through
i
ca
imagine
except
that
the
lieutenant
loudly
proclaimed
that
he
was
a
crazy
boer
anyhow
the
upshot
was
that
peter
was
marched
off
to
gaol
and
i
was
left
in
a
pretty
pickle
do
believe
a
word
of
it
i
said
firmly
i
had
most
of
my
clothes
on
now
and
felt
more
courageous
is
all
a
plot
to
get
him
into
disgrace
and
draft
him
off
to
the
front
stumm
did
not
storm
as
i
expected
but
smiled
was
always
his
destiny
he
said
since
i
saw
him
he
was
no
use
to
us
except
as
a
man
with
a
rifle
nothing
else
do
you
imagine
you
fool
that
this
great
empire
in
the
thick
of
a
is
going
to
trouble
its
head
to
lay
snares
for
an
ignorant
wash
my
hands
of
him
i
said
what
you
say
of
his
folly
is
true
i
have
no
part
in
it
but
he
was
my
companion
and
i
wish
him
well
what
do
you
propose
to
do
with
him
will
keep
him
under
our
eye
he
said
with
a
wicked
twist
of
the
mouth
have
a
notion
that
there
is
more
at
the
back
of
this
than
appears
we
will
investigate
the
antecedents
of
herr
pienaar
and
you
too
my
friend
on
you
also
we
have
our
eye
i
did
the
best
thing
i
could
have
done
for
what
with
anxiety
and
disgust
i
lost
my
temper
here
sir
i
cried
had
about
enough
of
this
i
came
to
germany
abominating
the
english
and
burning
to
strike
a
blow
for
you
but
you
have
given
me
much
cause
to
love
you
for
the
last
two
days
i
had
nothing
from
you
but
suspicion
and
insult
the
only
decent
man
i
met
is
herr
gaudian
it
because
i
believe
that
there
are
many
in
germany
like
him
that
i
prepared
to
go
on
with
this
business
and
do
the
best
i
can
but
by
god
i
would
raise
my
little
finger
for
your
sake
he
looked
at
me
very
steadily
for
a
minute
sounds
like
honesty
he
said
at
last
in
a
civil
voice
had
better
come
down
and
get
your
coffee
i
was
safe
for
the
moment
but
in
very
low
spirits
what
on
earth
would
happen
to
poor
old
peter
i
could
do
nothing
even
if
i
wanted
and
besides
my
first
duty
was
to
my
mission
i
had
made
this
very
clear
to
him
at
lisbon
and
he
had
agreed
but
all
the
same
it
was
a
beastly
reflection
here
was
that
ancient
worthy
left
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
people
he
most
detested
on
earth
my
only
comfort
was
that
they
could
do
very
much
with
him
if
they
sent
him
to
the
front
which
was
the
worst
they
could
do
he
would
escape
for
i
would
have
backed
him
to
get
through
any
mortal
lines
it
was
much
fun
for
me
either
only
when
i
was
to
be
deprived
of
it
did
i
realize
how
much
his
company
had
meant
to
me
i
was
absolutely
alone
now
and
i
did
like
it
i
seemed
to
have
about
as
much
chance
of
joining
blenkiron
and
sandy
as
of
flying
to
the
moon
after
breakfast
i
was
told
to
get
ready
when
i
asked
where
i
was
going
stumm
advised
me
to
mind
my
own
business
but
i
remembered
that
last
night
he
had
talked
of
taking
me
home
with
him
and
giving
me
my
orders
i
wondered
where
his
home
was
gaudian
patted
me
on
the
back
when
we
started
and
wrung
my
hand
he
was
a
capital
good
fellow
and
it
made
me
feel
sick
to
think
that
i
was
humbugging
him
we
got
into
the
same
big
grey
car
with
servant
sitting
beside
the
chauffeur
it
was
a
morning
of
hard
frost
the
bare
fields
were
white
with
rime
and
the
powdered
like
a
we
took
a
different
road
from
the
night
before
and
after
a
run
of
half
a
dozen
miles
came
to
a
little
town
with
a
big
railway
station
it
was
a
junction
on
some
main
line
and
after
five
minutes
waiting
we
found
our
train
once
again
we
were
alone
in
the
carriage
stumm
must
have
had
some
colossal
graft
for
the
train
was
crowded
i
had
another
three
hours
of
complete
boredom
i
dared
not
smoke
and
could
do
nothing
but
stare
out
of
the
window
we
soon
got
into
hilly
country
where
a
good
deal
of
snow
was
lying
it
was
the
day
of
december
and
even
in
war
time
one
had
a
sort
of
feel
of
christmas
you
could
see
girls
carrying
evergreens
and
when
we
stopped
at
a
station
the
soldiers
on
leave
had
all
the
air
of
holiday
making
the
middle
of
germany
was
a
cheerier
place
than
berlin
or
the
western
parts
i
liked
the
look
of
the
old
peasants
and
the
women
in
their
neat
sunday
best
but
i
noticed
too
how
pinched
they
were
here
in
the
country
where
no
neutral
tourists
came
there
was
not
the
same
as
in
the
capital
stumm
made
an
attempt
to
talk
to
me
on
the
journey
i
could
see
his
aim
before
this
he
had
me
but
now
he
wanted
to
draw
me
into
ordinary
conversation
he
had
no
notion
how
to
do
it
he
was
either
peremptory
and
provocative
like
a
or
so
obviously
diplomatic
that
any
fool
would
have
been
put
on
his
guard
that
is
the
weakness
of
the
german
he
has
no
gift
for
laying
himself
alongside
different
types
of
men
he
is
such
a
being
that
he
can
not
put
out
feelers
to
his
kind
he
may
have
plenty
of
brains
as
stumm
had
but
he
has
the
poorest
notion
of
psychology
of
any
of
creatures
in
germany
only
the
jew
can
get
outside
himself
and
that
is
why
if
you
look
into
the
matter
you
will
find
that
the
jew
is
at
the
back
of
most
german
enterprises
after
midday
we
stopped
at
a
station
for
luncheon
we
had
a
very
good
meal
in
the
restaurant
and
when
we
were
finishing
two
officers
entered
stumm
got
up
and
saluted
and
went
aside
to
talk
to
them
then
he
came
back
and
made
me
follow
him
to
a
where
he
told
me
to
stay
till
he
fetched
me
i
noticed
that
he
called
a
porter
and
had
the
door
locked
when
he
went
out
it
was
a
chilly
place
with
no
fire
and
i
kicked
my
heels
there
for
twenty
minutes
i
was
living
by
the
hour
now
and
did
not
trouble
to
worry
about
this
strange
behaviour
there
was
a
volume
of
on
a
shelf
and
i
turned
the
pages
idly
till
i
struck
a
big
railway
map
then
it
occurred
to
me
to
find
out
where
we
were
going
i
had
heard
stumm
take
my
ticket
for
a
place
called
schwandorf
and
after
a
lot
of
searching
i
found
it
it
was
away
south
in
bavaria
and
so
far
as
i
could
make
out
less
than
fifty
miles
from
the
danube
that
cheered
me
enormously
if
stumm
lived
there
he
would
most
likely
start
me
off
on
my
travels
by
the
railway
which
i
saw
running
to
vienna
and
then
on
to
the
east
it
looked
as
if
i
might
get
to
constantinople
after
all
but
i
feared
it
would
be
a
useless
achievement
for
what
could
i
do
when
i
got
there
i
was
being
hustled
out
of
germany
without
picking
up
the
slenderest
clue
the
door
opened
and
stumm
entered
he
seemed
to
have
got
bigger
in
the
interval
and
to
carry
his
head
higher
there
was
a
proud
light
too
in
his
eye
he
said
are
about
to
receive
the
greatest
privilege
that
ever
fell
to
one
of
your
race
his
imperial
majesty
is
passing
through
here
and
has
halted
for
a
few
minutes
he
has
done
me
the
honour
to
receive
me
and
when
he
heard
my
story
he
expressed
a
wish
to
see
you
you
will
follow
me
to
his
presence
do
not
be
afraid
the
is
merciful
and
gracious
answer
his
questions
like
a
man
i
followed
him
with
a
quickened
pulse
here
was
a
bit
of
luck
i
had
never
dreamed
of
at
the
far
side
of
the
station
a
train
had
drawn
up
a
train
consisting
of
three
big
coaches
and
picked
out
with
gold
on
the
platform
beside
it
stood
a
small
group
of
officers
tall
men
in
long
cloaks
they
seemed
to
be
mostly
elderly
and
one
or
two
of
the
faces
i
thought
i
remembered
from
photographs
in
the
picture
papers
as
we
approached
they
drew
apart
and
left
us
face
to
face
with
one
man
he
was
a
little
below
middle
height
and
all
muffled
in
a
thick
coat
with
a
fur
collar
he
wore
a
silver
helmet
with
an
eagle
atop
of
it
and
kept
his
left
hand
resting
on
his
sword
below
the
helmet
was
a
face
the
colour
of
grey
paper
from
which
shone
curious
sombre
restless
eyes
with
dark
pouches
beneath
them
there
was
no
fear
of
my
mistaking
him
these
were
the
features
which
since
napoleon
have
been
best
known
to
the
world
i
stood
as
stiff
as
a
ramrod
and
saluted
i
was
perfectly
cool
and
most
desperately
interested
for
such
a
moment
i
would
have
gone
through
fire
and
water
this
is
the
dutchman
i
spoke
of
i
heard
stumm
say
language
does
he
speak
the
emperor
asked
was
the
reply
being
a
south
african
he
also
speaks
english
a
spasm
of
pain
seemed
to
flit
over
the
face
before
me
then
he
addressed
me
in
english
have
come
from
a
land
which
will
yet
be
our
ally
to
offer
your
sword
to
our
service
i
accept
the
gift
and
hail
it
as
a
good
omen
i
would
have
given
your
race
its
freedom
but
there
were
fools
and
traitors
among
you
who
misjudged
me
but
that
freedom
i
shall
yet
give
you
in
spite
of
yourselves
are
there
many
like
you
in
your
country
are
thousands
sire
i
said
lying
cheerfully
am
one
of
many
who
think
that
my
race
life
lies
in
your
victory
and
i
think
that
that
victory
must
be
won
not
in
europe
alone
in
south
africa
for
the
moment
there
is
no
chance
so
we
look
to
other
parts
of
the
continent
you
will
win
in
europe
you
have
won
in
the
east
and
it
now
remains
to
strike
the
english
where
they
can
not
fend
the
blow
if
we
take
uganda
egypt
will
fall
by
your
permission
i
go
there
to
make
trouble
for
your
enemies
a
flicker
of
a
smile
passed
over
the
worn
face
it
was
the
face
of
one
who
slept
little
and
whose
thoughts
rode
him
like
a
nightmare
is
well
he
said
englishman
once
said
that
he
would
call
in
the
new
world
to
redress
the
balance
of
the
old
we
germans
will
summon
the
whole
earth
to
suppress
the
infamies
of
england
serve
us
well
and
you
will
not
be
forgotten
then
he
suddenly
asked
you
fight
in
the
last
south
african
war
sir
i
said
was
in
the
commando
of
that
smuts
who
has
now
been
bought
by
england
were
your
countrymen
losses
he
asked
eagerly
i
did
not
know
but
i
hazarded
a
guess
the
field
some
twenty
thousand
but
many
more
by
sickness
and
in
the
accursed
of
the
english
again
a
spasm
of
pain
crossed
his
face
thousand
he
repeated
huskily
mere
handful
today
we
lose
as
many
in
a
skirmish
in
the
polish
marshes
then
he
broke
out
fiercely
did
not
seek
the
war
it
was
forced
on
me
i
laboured
for
peace
the
blood
of
millions
is
on
the
heads
of
england
and
russia
but
england
most
of
all
god
will
yet
avenge
it
he
that
takes
the
sword
will
perish
by
the
sword
mine
was
forced
from
the
scabbard
in
and
i
am
guiltless
do
they
know
that
among
your
people
the
world
knows
it
sire
i
said
he
gave
his
hand
to
stumm
and
turned
away
the
last
i
saw
of
him
was
a
figure
moving
like
a
with
no
spring
in
his
step
amid
his
tall
suite
i
felt
that
i
was
looking
on
at
a
far
bigger
tragedy
than
any
i
had
seen
in
action
here
was
one
that
had
loosed
hell
and
the
furies
of
hell
had
got
hold
of
him
he
was
no
common
man
for
in
his
presence
i
felt
an
attraction
which
was
not
merely
the
mastery
of
one
used
to
command
that
would
not
have
impressed
me
for
i
had
never
owned
a
master
but
here
was
a
human
being
who
unlike
stumm
and
his
kind
had
the
power
of
laying
himself
alongside
other
men
that
was
the
irony
of
it
stumm
would
not
have
cared
a
tinker
curse
for
all
the
massacres
in
history
but
this
man
the
chief
of
a
nation
of
stumms
paid
the
price
in
war
for
the
gifts
that
had
made
him
successful
in
peace
he
had
imagination
and
nerves
and
the
one
was
white
hot
and
the
others
were
quivering
i
would
not
have
been
in
his
shoes
for
the
throne
of
the
universe
all
afternoon
we
sped
southward
mostly
in
a
country
of
hills
and
wooded
valleys
stumm
for
him
was
very
pleasant
his
imperial
master
must
have
been
gracious
to
him
and
he
passed
a
bit
of
it
on
to
me
but
he
was
anxious
to
see
that
i
had
got
the
right
impression
is
merciful
as
i
told
you
he
said
i
agreed
with
him
is
the
prerogative
of
kings
he
said
sententiously
for
us
lesser
folks
it
is
a
trimming
we
can
well
do
without
i
nodded
my
approval
am
not
merciful
he
went
on
as
if
i
needed
telling
that
any
man
stands
in
my
way
i
trample
the
life
out
of
him
that
is
the
german
fashion
that
is
what
has
made
us
great
we
do
not
make
war
with
lavender
gloves
and
fine
phrases
but
with
hard
steel
and
hard
brains
we
germans
will
cure
the
of
the
world
the
nations
rise
against
us
pouf
they
are
soft
flesh
and
flesh
can
not
resist
iron
the
shining
ploughshare
will
cut
its
way
through
acres
of
mud
i
hastened
to
add
that
these
were
also
my
opinions
the
hell
do
your
opinions
matter
you
are
a
boor
of
the
veld
not
but
what
he
added
is
metal
in
you
slow
dutchmen
once
we
germans
have
had
the
forging
of
it
the
winter
evening
closed
in
and
i
saw
that
we
had
come
out
of
the
hills
and
were
in
flat
country
sometimes
a
big
sweep
of
river
showed
and
looking
out
at
one
station
i
saw
a
funny
church
with
a
thing
like
an
onion
on
top
of
its
spire
it
might
almost
have
been
a
mosque
judging
from
the
pictures
i
remembered
of
mosques
i
wished
to
heaven
i
had
given
geography
more
attention
in
my
time
presently
we
stopped
and
stumm
led
the
way
out
the
train
must
have
been
specially
halted
for
him
for
it
was
a
little
place
whose
name
i
could
not
make
out
the
was
waiting
bowing
and
saluting
and
outside
was
a
with
big
next
minute
we
were
sliding
through
dark
woods
where
the
snow
lay
far
deeper
than
in
the
north
there
was
a
mild
frost
in
the
air
and
the
tyres
slipped
and
skidded
at
the
corners
we
had
far
to
go
we
climbed
a
little
hill
and
on
the
top
of
it
stopped
at
the
door
of
a
big
black
castle
it
looked
enormous
in
the
winter
night
with
not
a
light
showing
anywhere
on
its
front
the
door
was
opened
by
an
old
fellow
who
took
a
long
time
about
it
and
got
well
cursed
for
his
slowness
inside
the
place
was
very
noble
and
ancient
stumm
switched
on
the
electric
light
and
there
was
a
great
hall
with
black
tarnished
portraits
of
men
and
women
in
clothes
and
mighty
horns
of
deer
on
the
walls
there
seemed
to
be
no
superfluity
of
servants
the
old
fellow
said
that
food
was
ready
and
without
more
ado
we
went
into
the
another
vast
chamber
with
rough
stone
walls
above
the
panelling
and
found
some
cold
meats
on
the
table
beside
a
big
fire
the
servant
presently
brought
in
a
ham
omelette
and
on
that
and
the
cold
stuff
we
dined
i
remember
there
was
nothing
to
drink
but
water
it
puzzled
me
how
stumm
kept
his
great
body
going
on
the
very
moderate
amount
of
food
he
ate
he
was
the
type
you
expect
to
swill
beer
by
the
bucket
and
put
away
a
pie
in
a
sitting
when
we
had
finished
he
rang
for
the
old
man
and
told
him
that
we
should
be
in
the
study
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
can
lock
up
and
go
to
bed
when
you
like
he
said
see
you
have
coffee
ready
at
seven
sharp
in
the
morning
ever
since
i
entered
that
house
i
had
the
uncomfortable
feeling
of
being
in
a
prison
here
was
i
alone
in
this
great
place
with
a
fellow
who
could
and
would
wring
my
neck
if
he
wanted
berlin
and
all
the
rest
of
it
had
seemed
comparatively
open
country
i
had
felt
that
i
could
move
freely
and
at
the
worst
make
a
bolt
for
it
but
here
i
was
trapped
and
i
had
to
tell
myself
every
minute
that
i
was
there
as
a
friend
and
colleague
the
fact
is
i
was
afraid
of
stumm
and
i
mind
admitting
it
he
was
a
new
thing
in
my
experience
and
i
like
it
if
only
he
had
drunk
and
guzzled
a
bit
i
should
have
been
happier
we
went
up
a
staircase
to
a
room
at
the
end
of
a
long
corridor
stumm
locked
the
door
behind
him
and
laid
the
key
on
the
table
that
room
took
my
breath
away
it
was
so
unexpected
in
place
of
the
grim
bareness
of
downstairs
here
was
a
place
all
luxury
and
colour
and
light
it
was
very
large
but
low
in
the
ceiling
and
the
walls
were
full
of
little
recesses
with
statues
in
them
a
thick
grey
carpet
of
velvet
pile
covered
the
floor
and
the
chairs
were
low
and
soft
and
upholstered
like
a
lady
boudoir
a
pleasant
fire
burned
on
the
hearth
and
there
was
a
flavour
of
scent
in
the
air
something
like
incense
or
burnt
sandalwood
a
french
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
told
me
that
it
was
ten
minutes
past
eight
everywhere
on
little
tables
and
in
cabinets
was
a
profusion
of
knickknacks
and
there
was
some
beautiful
embroidery
framed
on
screens
at
first
sight
you
would
have
said
it
was
a
woman
but
it
was
i
soon
saw
the
difference
there
had
never
been
a
woman
hand
in
that
place
it
was
the
room
of
a
man
who
had
a
passion
for
frippery
who
had
a
perverted
taste
for
soft
delicate
things
it
was
the
complement
to
his
bluff
brutality
i
began
to
see
the
queer
other
side
to
my
host
that
evil
side
which
gossip
had
spoken
of
as
not
unknown
in
the
german
army
the
room
seemed
a
horribly
unwholesome
place
and
i
was
more
than
ever
afraid
of
stumm
the
hearthrug
was
a
wonderful
old
persian
thing
all
faint
greens
and
pinks
as
he
stood
on
it
he
looked
uncommonly
like
a
bull
in
a
he
seemed
to
bask
in
the
comfort
of
it
and
sniffed
like
a
satisfied
animal
then
he
sat
down
at
an
escritoire
unlocked
a
drawer
and
took
out
some
papers
will
now
settle
your
business
friend
brandt
he
said
will
go
to
egypt
and
there
take
your
orders
from
one
whose
name
and
address
are
in
this
envelope
this
card
and
he
lifted
a
square
piece
of
grey
pasteboard
with
a
big
stamp
at
the
corner
and
some
code
words
stencilled
on
it
be
your
passport
you
will
show
it
to
the
man
you
seek
keep
it
jealously
and
never
use
it
save
under
orders
or
in
the
last
necessity
it
is
your
badge
as
an
accredited
agent
of
the
german
crown
i
took
the
card
and
the
envelope
and
put
them
in
my
do
i
go
after
egypt
i
asked
remains
to
be
seen
probably
you
will
go
up
the
blue
nile
riza
the
man
you
will
meet
will
direct
you
egypt
is
a
nest
of
our
agents
who
work
peacefully
under
the
nose
of
the
english
secret
service
am
willing
i
said
how
do
i
reach
egypt
will
travel
by
holland
and
london
here
is
your
route
and
he
took
a
paper
from
his
pocket
passports
are
ready
and
will
be
given
you
at
the
frontier
this
was
a
pretty
kettle
of
fish
i
was
to
be
packed
off
to
cairo
by
sea
which
would
take
weeks
and
god
knows
how
i
would
get
from
egypt
to
constantinople
i
saw
all
my
plans
falling
to
pieces
about
my
ears
and
just
when
i
thought
they
were
shaping
nicely
stumm
must
have
interpreted
the
look
on
my
face
as
fear
have
no
cause
to
be
afraid
he
said
have
passed
the
word
to
the
english
police
to
look
out
for
a
suspicious
south
african
named
brandt
one
of
maritz
rebels
it
is
not
difficult
to
have
that
kind
of
a
hint
conveyed
to
the
proper
quarter
but
the
description
will
not
be
yours
your
name
will
be
van
der
linden
a
respectable
java
merchant
going
home
to
his
plantations
after
a
visit
to
his
native
shores
you
had
better
get
your
by
heart
but
i
guarantee
you
will
be
asked
no
questions
we
manage
these
things
well
in
germany
i
kept
my
eyes
on
the
fire
while
i
did
some
savage
thinking
i
knew
they
would
not
let
me
out
of
their
sight
till
they
saw
me
in
holland
and
once
there
there
would
be
no
possibility
of
getting
back
when
i
left
this
house
i
would
have
no
chance
of
giving
them
the
slip
and
yet
i
was
well
on
my
way
to
the
east
the
danube
could
not
be
fifty
miles
off
and
that
way
ran
the
road
to
constantinople
it
was
a
fairly
desperate
position
if
i
tried
to
get
away
stumm
would
prevent
me
and
the
odds
were
that
i
would
go
to
join
peter
in
some
infernal
those
moments
were
some
of
the
worst
i
ever
spent
i
was
absolutely
and
utterly
baffled
like
a
rat
in
a
trap
there
seemed
nothing
for
it
but
to
go
back
to
london
and
tell
sir
walter
the
game
was
up
and
that
was
about
as
bitter
as
death
he
saw
my
face
and
laughed
your
heart
fail
you
my
little
dutchman
you
funk
the
english
i
will
tell
you
one
thing
for
your
comfort
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
to
be
feared
except
me
fail
and
you
have
cause
to
shiver
play
me
false
and
you
had
far
better
never
have
been
born
his
ugly
sneering
face
was
close
above
mine
then
he
put
out
his
hands
and
gripped
my
shoulders
as
he
had
done
the
first
afternoon
i
forget
if
i
mentioned
that
part
of
the
damage
i
got
at
loos
was
a
shrapnel
bullet
low
down
at
the
back
of
my
neck
the
wound
had
healed
well
enough
but
i
had
pains
there
on
a
cold
day
his
fingers
found
the
place
and
it
hurt
like
hell
there
is
a
very
narrow
line
between
despair
and
black
rage
i
had
about
given
up
the
game
but
the
sudden
ache
of
my
shoulders
gave
me
purpose
again
he
must
have
seen
the
rage
in
my
eyes
for
his
own
became
cruel
weasel
would
like
to
bite
he
cried
the
poor
weasel
has
found
its
master
stand
still
vermin
smile
look
pleasant
or
i
will
make
pulp
of
you
do
you
dare
to
frown
at
me
i
shut
my
teeth
and
said
never
a
word
i
was
choking
in
my
throat
and
could
not
have
uttered
a
syllable
if
i
had
tried
then
he
let
me
go
grinning
like
an
ape
i
stepped
back
a
pace
and
gave
him
my
left
between
the
eyes
for
a
second
he
did
not
realize
what
had
happened
for
i
do
suppose
anyone
had
dared
to
lift
a
hand
to
him
since
he
was
a
child
he
blinked
at
me
mildly
then
his
face
grew
as
red
as
fire
in
heaven
he
said
quietly
am
going
to
kill
you
and
he
flung
himself
on
me
like
a
mountain
i
was
expecting
him
and
dodged
the
attack
i
was
quite
calm
now
but
pretty
helpless
the
man
had
a
gorilla
reach
and
could
give
me
at
least
a
couple
of
stone
he
was
soft
either
but
looked
as
hard
as
granite
i
was
only
just
from
hospital
and
absurdly
out
of
training
he
would
certainly
kill
me
if
he
could
and
i
saw
nothing
to
prevent
him
my
only
chance
was
to
keep
him
from
getting
to
grips
for
he
could
have
squeezed
in
my
ribs
in
two
seconds
i
fancied
i
was
lighter
on
my
legs
than
him
and
i
had
a
good
eye
black
monty
at
kimberley
had
taught
me
to
fight
a
bit
but
there
is
no
art
on
earth
which
can
prevent
a
big
man
in
a
narrow
space
from
sooner
or
later
cornering
a
lesser
one
that
was
the
danger
backwards
and
forwards
we
padded
on
the
soft
carpet
he
had
no
notion
of
guarding
himself
and
i
got
in
a
good
few
blows
then
i
saw
a
queer
thing
every
time
i
hit
him
he
blinked
and
seemed
to
pause
i
guessed
the
reason
for
that
he
had
gone
through
life
keeping
the
crown
of
the
causeway
and
nobody
had
ever
stood
up
to
him
he
was
a
coward
by
a
long
chalk
but
he
was
a
bully
and
had
never
been
struck
in
his
life
he
was
getting
struck
now
in
real
earnest
and
he
did
like
it
he
had
lost
his
bearings
and
was
growing
as
mad
as
a
hatter
i
kept
half
an
eye
on
the
clock
i
was
hopeful
now
and
was
looking
for
the
right
kind
of
chance
the
risk
was
that
i
might
tire
sooner
than
him
and
be
at
his
mercy
then
i
learned
a
truth
i
have
never
forgotten
if
you
are
fighting
a
man
who
means
to
kill
you
he
will
be
apt
to
down
you
unless
you
mean
to
kill
him
too
stumm
did
not
know
any
rules
to
this
game
and
i
forgot
to
allow
for
that
suddenly
when
i
was
watching
his
eyes
he
launched
a
mighty
kick
at
my
stomach
if
he
had
got
me
this
yarn
would
have
had
an
abrupt
ending
but
by
the
mercy
of
god
i
was
moving
sideways
when
he
let
out
and
his
heavy
boot
just
grazed
my
left
thigh
it
was
the
place
where
most
of
the
shrapnel
had
lodged
and
for
a
second
i
was
sick
with
pain
and
stumbled
then
i
was
on
my
feet
again
but
with
a
new
feeling
in
my
blood
i
had
to
smash
stumm
or
never
sleep
in
my
bed
again
i
got
a
wonderful
power
from
this
new
cold
rage
of
mine
i
felt
i
could
tire
and
i
danced
round
and
dotted
his
face
till
it
was
streaming
with
blood
his
bulky
padded
chest
was
no
good
to
me
so
i
could
try
for
the
mark
he
began
to
snort
now
and
his
breath
came
heavily
infernal
cad
i
said
in
good
round
english
going
to
knock
the
stuffing
out
of
you
but
he
did
know
what
i
was
saying
then
at
last
he
gave
me
my
chance
he
half
tripped
over
a
little
table
and
his
face
stuck
forward
i
got
him
on
the
point
of
the
chin
and
put
every
ounce
of
weight
i
possessed
behind
the
blow
he
crumpled
up
in
a
heap
and
rolled
over
upsetting
a
lamp
and
knocking
a
big
china
jar
in
two
his
head
i
remember
lay
under
the
escritoire
from
which
he
had
taken
my
passport
i
picked
up
the
key
and
unlocked
the
door
in
one
of
the
gilded
mirrors
i
smoothed
my
hair
and
tidied
up
my
clothes
my
anger
had
completely
gone
and
i
had
no
particular
left
against
stumm
he
was
a
man
of
remarkable
qualities
which
would
have
brought
him
to
the
highest
distinction
in
the
stone
age
but
for
all
that
he
and
his
kind
were
back
numbers
i
stepped
out
of
the
room
locked
the
door
behind
me
and
started
out
on
the
second
stage
of
my
travels
chapter
seven
christmastide
everything
depended
on
whether
the
servant
was
in
the
hall
i
had
put
stumm
to
sleep
for
a
bit
but
i
could
flatter
myself
he
would
long
be
quiet
and
when
he
came
to
he
would
kick
the
locked
door
to
matchwood
i
must
get
out
of
the
house
without
a
minute
delay
and
if
the
door
was
shut
and
the
old
man
gone
to
bed
i
was
done
i
met
him
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
carrying
a
candle
master
wants
me
to
send
off
an
important
telegram
where
is
the
nearest
office
there
one
in
the
village
is
there
i
spoke
in
my
best
german
the
first
time
i
had
used
the
tongue
since
i
crossed
the
frontier
village
is
five
minutes
off
at
the
foot
of
the
avenue
he
said
you
be
long
sir
be
back
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
said
lock
up
till
i
get
in
i
put
on
my
ulster
and
walked
out
into
a
clear
starry
night
my
bag
i
left
lying
on
a
settle
in
the
hall
there
was
nothing
in
it
to
compromise
me
but
i
wished
i
could
have
got
a
toothbrush
and
some
tobacco
out
of
it
so
began
one
of
the
craziest
escapades
you
can
well
imagine
i
could
stop
to
think
of
the
future
yet
but
must
take
one
step
at
a
time
i
ran
down
the
avenue
my
feet
cracking
on
the
hard
snow
planning
hard
my
programme
for
the
next
hour
i
found
the
village
half
a
dozen
houses
with
one
biggish
place
that
looked
like
an
inn
the
moon
was
rising
and
as
i
approached
i
saw
that
there
was
some
kind
of
a
store
a
funny
little
car
was
purring
before
the
door
and
i
guessed
this
was
also
the
telegraph
office
i
marched
in
and
told
my
story
to
a
stout
woman
with
spectacles
on
her
nose
who
was
talking
to
a
young
man
is
too
late
she
shook
her
head
herr
burgrave
knows
that
well
there
is
no
connection
from
here
after
eight
if
the
matter
is
urgent
you
must
go
to
schwandorf
far
is
that
i
asked
looking
for
some
excuse
to
get
decently
out
of
the
shop
miles
she
said
here
is
franz
and
the
franz
you
will
be
glad
to
give
the
gentleman
a
seat
beside
you
the
youth
muttered
something
which
i
took
to
be
assent
and
finished
off
a
glass
of
beer
from
his
eyes
and
manner
he
looked
as
if
he
were
half
drunk
i
thanked
the
woman
and
went
out
to
the
car
for
i
was
in
a
fever
to
take
advantage
of
this
unexpected
bit
of
luck
i
could
hear
the
enjoining
franz
not
to
keep
the
gentleman
waiting
and
presently
he
came
out
and
flopped
into
the
driver
seat
we
started
in
a
series
of
voluptuous
curves
till
his
eyes
got
accustomed
to
the
darkness
at
first
we
made
good
going
along
the
straight
broad
highway
lined
with
woods
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
snowy
fields
melting
into
haze
then
he
began
to
talk
and
as
he
talked
he
slowed
down
this
by
no
means
suited
my
book
and
i
seriously
wondered
whether
i
should
pitch
him
out
and
take
charge
of
the
thing
he
was
obviously
a
weakling
left
behind
in
the
conscription
and
i
could
have
done
it
with
one
hand
but
by
a
fortunate
chance
i
left
him
alone
is
a
fine
hat
of
yours
mein
herr
he
said
he
took
off
his
own
blue
peaked
cap
the
uniform
i
suppose
of
the
driver
of
the
and
laid
it
on
his
knee
the
night
air
ruffled
a
shock
of
hair
then
he
calmly
took
my
hat
and
clapped
it
on
his
head
this
thing
i
should
be
a
gentleman
he
said
i
said
nothing
but
put
on
his
cap
and
waited
is
a
noble
overcoat
mein
herr
he
went
on
goes
well
with
the
hat
it
is
the
kind
of
garment
i
have
always
desired
to
own
in
two
days
it
will
be
the
holy
christmas
when
gifts
are
given
would
that
the
good
god
sent
me
such
a
coat
as
yours
can
try
it
on
to
see
how
it
looks
i
said
he
stopped
the
car
with
a
jerk
and
pulled
off
his
blue
coat
the
exchange
was
soon
effected
he
was
about
my
height
and
my
ulster
fitted
not
so
badly
i
put
on
his
overcoat
which
had
a
big
collar
that
buttoned
round
the
neck
the
idiot
preened
himself
like
a
girl
drink
and
vanity
had
primed
him
for
any
folly
he
drove
so
carelessly
for
a
bit
that
he
nearly
put
us
into
a
ditch
we
passed
several
cottages
and
at
the
last
he
slowed
down
friend
of
mine
lives
here
he
announced
would
like
to
see
me
in
the
fine
clothes
which
the
most
amiable
herr
has
given
me
wait
for
me
i
will
not
be
long
and
he
scrambled
out
of
the
car
and
lurched
into
the
little
garden
i
took
his
place
and
moved
very
slowly
forward
i
heard
the
door
open
and
the
sound
of
laughing
and
loud
voices
then
it
shut
and
looking
back
i
saw
that
my
idiot
had
been
absorbed
into
the
dwelling
of
his
gertrud
i
waited
no
longer
but
sent
the
car
forward
at
its
best
speed
five
minutes
later
the
infernal
thing
began
to
give
trouble
a
nut
loose
in
the
antiquated
i
unhooked
a
lamp
examined
it
and
put
the
mischief
right
but
i
was
a
quarter
of
an
hour
doing
it
the
highway
ran
now
in
a
thick
forest
and
i
noticed
branches
going
off
now
and
then
to
the
right
i
was
just
thinking
of
turning
up
one
of
them
for
i
had
no
anxiety
to
visit
schwandorf
when
i
heard
behind
me
the
sound
of
a
great
car
driven
furiously
i
drew
in
to
the
right
side
thank
goodness
i
remembered
the
rule
of
the
road
and
proceeded
decorously
wondering
what
was
going
to
happen
i
could
hear
the
brakes
being
clamped
on
and
the
car
slowing
down
suddenly
a
big
grey
bonnet
slipped
past
me
and
as
i
turned
my
head
i
heard
a
familiar
voice
it
was
stumm
looking
like
something
that
has
been
run
over
he
had
his
jaw
in
a
sling
so
that
i
wondered
if
i
had
broken
it
and
his
eyes
were
beautifully
bunged
up
it
was
that
that
saved
me
that
and
his
raging
temper
the
collar
of
the
postman
coat
was
round
my
chin
hiding
my
beard
and
i
had
his
cap
pulled
well
down
on
my
brow
i
remembered
what
blenkiron
had
said
that
the
only
way
to
deal
with
the
germans
was
naked
bluff
mine
was
naked
enough
for
it
was
all
that
was
left
to
me
is
the
man
you
brought
from
andersbach
he
roared
as
well
as
his
jaw
would
allow
him
i
pretended
to
be
mortally
scared
and
spoke
in
the
best
imitation
i
could
manage
of
the
postman
high
cracked
voice
got
out
a
mile
back
herr
burgrave
i
quavered
was
a
rude
fellow
who
wanted
to
go
to
schwandorf
and
then
changed
his
mind
you
fool
say
exactly
where
he
got
down
or
i
will
wring
your
neck
the
wood
this
side
of
gertrud
cottage
on
the
left
hand
i
left
him
running
among
the
trees
i
put
all
the
terror
i
knew
into
my
pipe
and
it
was
all
acting
means
the
henrichs
cottage
herr
colonel
said
the
chauffeur
man
is
courting
the
daughter
stumm
gave
an
order
and
the
great
car
backed
and
as
i
looked
round
i
saw
it
turning
then
as
it
gathered
speed
it
shot
forward
and
presently
was
lost
in
the
shadows
i
had
got
over
the
first
hurdle
but
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
stumm
would
meet
the
postman
and
would
be
tearing
after
me
any
minute
i
took
the
first
turning
and
bucketed
along
a
narrow
woodland
road
the
hard
ground
would
show
very
few
tracks
i
thought
and
i
hoped
the
pursuit
would
think
i
had
gone
on
to
schwandorf
but
it
would
do
to
risk
it
and
i
was
determined
very
soon
to
get
the
car
off
the
road
leave
it
and
take
to
the
forest
i
took
out
my
watch
and
calculated
i
could
give
myself
ten
minutes
i
was
very
nearly
caught
presently
i
came
on
a
bit
of
rough
heath
with
a
slope
away
from
the
road
and
here
and
there
a
patch
of
black
which
i
took
to
be
a
sandpit
opposite
one
of
these
i
slewed
the
car
to
the
edge
got
out
started
it
again
and
saw
it
pitch
into
the
darkness
there
was
a
splash
of
water
and
then
silence
craning
over
i
could
see
nothing
but
murk
and
the
marks
at
the
lip
where
the
wheels
had
passed
they
would
find
my
tracks
in
daylight
but
scarcely
at
this
time
of
night
then
i
ran
across
the
road
to
the
forest
i
was
only
just
in
time
for
the
echoes
of
the
splash
had
hardly
died
away
when
i
heard
the
sound
of
another
car
i
lay
flat
in
a
hollow
below
a
tangle
of
brambles
and
looked
between
the
at
the
moonlit
road
it
was
stumm
car
again
and
to
my
consternation
it
stopped
just
a
little
short
of
the
sandpit
i
saw
an
electric
torch
flashed
and
stumm
himself
got
out
and
examined
the
tracks
on
the
highway
thank
god
they
would
be
still
there
for
him
to
find
but
had
he
tried
half
a
dozen
yards
on
he
would
have
seen
them
turn
towards
the
sandpit
if
that
had
happened
he
would
have
beaten
the
adjacent
woods
and
most
certainly
found
me
there
was
a
third
man
in
the
car
with
my
hat
and
coat
on
him
that
poor
devil
of
a
postman
had
paid
dear
for
his
vanity
they
took
a
long
time
before
they
started
again
and
i
was
jolly
well
relieved
when
they
went
scouring
down
the
road
i
ran
deeper
into
the
woods
till
i
found
a
track
which
as
i
judged
from
the
sky
which
i
saw
in
a
clearing
took
me
nearly
due
west
that
was
the
direction
i
wanted
so
i
bore
off
at
right
angles
and
presently
struck
another
road
which
i
crossed
in
a
hurry
after
that
i
got
entangled
in
some
confounded
kind
of
enclosure
and
had
to
climb
paling
after
paling
of
rough
stakes
plaited
with
osiers
then
came
a
rise
in
the
ground
and
i
was
on
a
low
hill
of
pines
which
seemed
to
last
for
miles
all
the
time
i
was
going
at
a
good
pace
and
before
i
stopped
to
rest
i
calculated
i
had
put
six
miles
between
me
and
the
sandpit
my
mind
was
getting
a
little
more
active
now
for
the
first
part
of
the
journey
i
had
simply
staggered
from
impulse
to
impulse
these
impulses
had
been
uncommon
lucky
but
i
could
go
on
like
that
for
ever
sal
plan
says
the
old
boer
when
he
gets
into
trouble
and
it
was
up
to
me
now
to
make
a
plan
as
soon
as
i
began
to
think
i
saw
the
desperate
business
i
was
in
for
here
was
i
with
nothing
except
what
i
stood
up
in
including
a
coat
and
cap
that
were
mine
alone
in
in
the
heart
of
south
germany
there
was
a
man
behind
me
looking
for
my
blood
and
soon
there
would
be
a
for
me
up
and
down
the
land
i
had
heard
that
the
german
police
were
pretty
efficient
and
i
could
see
that
i
stood
the
slimmest
chance
if
they
caught
me
they
would
shoot
me
beyond
doubt
i
asked
myself
on
what
charge
and
answered
knocking
about
a
german
officer
they
could
have
me
up
for
espionage
for
as
far
as
i
knew
they
had
no
evidence
i
was
simply
a
dutchman
that
had
got
riled
and
had
run
amok
but
if
they
cut
down
a
cobbler
for
laughing
at
a
second
lieutenant
which
is
what
happened
at
zabern
i
calculated
that
hanging
would
be
too
good
for
a
man
that
had
broken
a
colonel
jaw
to
make
things
worse
my
job
was
not
to
escape
though
that
would
have
been
hard
enough
but
to
get
to
constantinople
more
than
a
thousand
miles
off
and
i
reckoned
i
could
get
there
as
a
tramp
i
had
to
be
sent
there
and
now
i
had
flung
away
my
chance
if
i
had
been
a
catholic
i
would
have
said
a
prayer
to
st
teresa
for
she
would
have
understood
my
troubles
my
mother
used
to
say
that
when
you
felt
down
on
your
luck
it
was
a
good
cure
to
count
your
mercies
so
i
set
about
counting
mine
the
first
was
that
i
was
well
started
on
my
journey
for
i
could
be
above
two
score
miles
from
the
danube
the
second
was
that
i
had
stumm
pass
i
did
see
how
i
could
use
it
but
there
it
was
lastly
i
had
plenty
of
money
english
sovereigns
and
the
equivalent
of
three
pounds
in
german
paper
which
i
had
changed
at
the
hotel
also
i
had
squared
accounts
with
old
stumm
that
was
the
biggest
mercy
of
all
i
thought
i
better
get
some
sleep
so
i
found
a
dryish
hole
below
an
oak
root
and
squeezed
myself
into
it
the
snow
lay
deep
in
these
woods
and
i
was
sopping
wet
up
to
the
knees
all
the
same
i
managed
to
sleep
for
some
hours
and
got
up
and
shook
myself
just
as
the
winter
dawn
was
breaking
through
the
tree
tops
breakfast
was
the
next
thing
and
i
must
find
some
sort
of
dwelling
almost
at
once
i
struck
a
road
a
big
highway
running
north
and
south
i
trotted
along
in
the
bitter
morning
to
get
my
circulation
started
and
presently
i
began
to
feel
a
little
better
in
a
little
i
saw
a
church
spire
which
meant
a
village
stumm
would
be
likely
to
have
got
on
my
tracks
yet
i
calculated
but
there
was
always
the
chance
that
he
had
warned
all
the
villages
round
by
telephone
and
that
they
might
be
on
the
for
me
but
that
risk
had
to
be
taken
for
i
must
have
food
it
was
the
day
before
christmas
i
remembered
and
people
would
be
holidaying
the
village
was
quite
a
big
place
but
at
this
hour
just
after
eight
there
was
nobody
in
the
street
except
a
wandering
dog
i
chose
the
most
unassuming
shop
i
could
find
where
a
little
boy
was
taking
down
the
shutters
one
of
those
general
stores
where
they
sell
everything
the
boy
fetched
a
very
old
woman
who
hobbled
in
from
the
back
fitting
on
her
spectacles
gott
she
said
in
a
friendly
voice
and
i
took
off
my
cap
i
saw
from
my
reflection
in
a
saucepan
that
i
looked
moderately
respectable
in
spite
of
my
night
in
the
woods
i
told
her
the
story
of
how
i
was
walking
from
schwandorf
to
see
my
mother
at
an
imaginary
place
called
judenfeld
banking
on
the
ignorance
of
villagers
about
any
place
five
miles
from
their
homes
i
said
my
luggage
had
gone
astray
and
i
had
time
to
wait
for
it
since
my
leave
was
short
the
old
lady
was
sympathetic
and
unsuspecting
she
sold
me
a
pound
of
chocolate
a
box
of
biscuits
the
better
part
of
a
ham
two
tins
of
sardines
and
a
rucksack
to
carry
them
i
also
bought
some
soap
a
comb
and
a
cheap
razor
and
a
small
tourists
guide
published
by
a
leipzig
firm
as
i
was
leaving
i
saw
what
seemed
like
garments
hanging
up
in
the
back
shop
and
turned
to
have
a
look
at
them
they
were
the
kind
of
thing
that
germans
wear
on
their
summer
walking
tours
long
shooting
capes
made
of
a
green
stuff
they
call
i
bought
one
and
a
green
felt
hat
and
an
alpenstock
to
keep
it
company
then
wishing
the
old
woman
and
her
belongings
a
merry
christmas
i
departed
and
took
the
shortest
cut
out
of
the
village
there
were
one
or
two
people
about
now
but
they
did
not
seem
to
notice
me
i
went
into
the
woods
again
and
walked
for
two
miles
till
i
halted
for
breakfast
i
was
not
feeling
quite
so
fit
now
and
i
did
not
make
much
of
my
provisions
beyond
eating
a
biscuit
and
some
chocolate
i
felt
very
thirsty
and
longed
for
hot
tea
in
an
icy
pool
i
washed
and
with
infinite
agony
shaved
my
beard
that
razor
was
the
worst
of
its
species
and
my
eyes
were
running
all
the
time
with
the
pain
of
the
operation
then
i
took
off
the
postman
coat
and
cap
and
buried
them
below
some
bushes
i
was
now
a
german
pedestrian
with
a
green
cape
and
hat
and
an
absurd
with
an
end
the
sort
of
person
who
roams
in
thousands
over
the
fatherland
in
summer
but
is
a
rarish
bird
in
the
tourists
guide
was
a
fortunate
purchase
for
it
contained
a
big
map
of
bavaria
which
gave
me
my
bearings
i
was
certainly
not
forty
miles
from
the
danube
more
like
thirty
the
road
through
the
village
i
had
left
would
have
taken
me
to
it
i
had
only
to
walk
due
south
and
i
would
reach
it
before
night
so
far
as
i
could
make
out
there
were
long
tongues
of
forest
running
down
to
the
river
and
i
resolved
to
keep
to
the
woodlands
at
the
worst
i
would
meet
a
forester
or
two
and
i
had
a
good
enough
story
for
them
on
the
highroad
there
might
be
awkward
questions
when
i
started
out
again
i
felt
very
stiff
and
the
cold
seemed
to
be
growing
intense
this
puzzled
me
for
i
had
not
minded
it
much
up
to
now
and
being
by
nature
it
never
used
to
worry
me
a
sharp
winter
night
on
the
was
a
long
sight
chillier
than
anything
i
had
struck
so
far
in
europe
but
now
my
teeth
were
chattering
and
the
marrow
seemed
to
be
freezing
in
my
bones
the
day
had
started
bright
and
clear
but
a
wrack
of
grey
clouds
soon
covered
the
sky
and
a
wind
from
the
east
began
to
whistle
as
i
stumbled
along
through
the
snowy
undergrowth
i
kept
longing
for
bright
warm
places
i
thought
of
those
long
days
on
the
veld
when
the
earth
was
like
a
great
yellow
bowl
with
white
roads
running
to
the
horizon
and
a
tiny
white
farm
basking
in
the
heart
of
it
with
its
blue
dam
and
patches
of
bright
green
lucerne
i
thought
of
those
baking
days
on
the
east
coast
when
the
sea
was
like
and
the
sky
one
burning
turquoise
but
most
of
all
i
thought
of
warm
scented
noons
on
trek
when
one
dozed
in
the
shadow
of
the
wagon
and
sniffed
the
from
the
fire
where
the
boys
were
cooking
dinner
from
these
pleasant
pictures
i
returned
to
the
beastly
present
the
thick
snowy
woods
the
lowering
sky
wet
clothes
a
hunted
present
and
a
dismal
future
i
felt
miserably
depressed
and
i
could
think
of
any
mercies
to
count
it
struck
me
that
i
might
be
falling
sick
about
midday
i
awoke
with
a
start
to
the
belief
that
i
was
being
pursued
i
can
not
explain
how
or
why
the
feeling
came
except
that
it
is
a
kind
of
instinct
that
men
get
who
have
lived
much
in
wild
countries
my
senses
which
had
been
numbed
suddenly
grew
keen
and
my
brain
began
to
work
double
quick
i
asked
myself
what
i
would
do
if
i
were
stumm
with
hatred
in
my
heart
a
broken
jaw
to
avenge
and
pretty
well
limitless
powers
he
must
have
found
the
car
in
the
sandpit
and
seen
my
tracks
in
the
wood
opposite
i
did
know
how
good
he
and
his
men
might
be
at
following
a
spoor
but
i
knew
that
any
ordinary
kaffir
could
have
nosed
it
out
easily
but
he
did
need
to
do
that
this
was
a
civilized
country
full
of
roads
and
railways
i
must
some
time
and
somewhere
come
out
of
the
woods
he
could
have
all
the
roads
watched
and
the
telephone
would
set
everyone
on
my
track
within
a
radius
of
fifty
miles
besides
he
would
soon
pick
up
my
trail
in
the
village
i
had
visited
that
morning
from
the
map
i
learned
that
it
was
called
greif
and
it
was
likely
to
live
up
to
that
name
with
me
presently
i
came
to
a
rocky
knoll
which
rose
out
of
the
forest
keeping
well
in
shelter
i
climbed
to
the
top
and
cautiously
looked
around
me
away
to
the
east
i
saw
the
vale
of
a
river
with
broad
fields
and
west
and
south
the
forest
rolled
unbroken
in
a
wilderness
of
snowy
there
was
no
sign
of
life
anywhere
not
even
a
bird
but
i
knew
very
well
that
behind
me
in
the
woods
were
men
moving
swiftly
on
my
track
and
that
it
was
pretty
well
impossible
for
me
to
get
away
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
go
on
till
i
dropped
or
was
taken
i
shaped
my
course
south
with
a
shade
of
west
in
it
for
the
map
showed
me
that
in
that
direction
i
would
soonest
strike
the
danube
what
i
was
going
to
do
when
i
got
there
i
did
trouble
to
think
i
had
fixed
the
river
as
my
immediate
goal
and
the
future
must
take
care
of
itself
i
was
now
certain
that
i
had
fever
on
me
it
was
still
in
my
bones
as
a
legacy
from
africa
and
had
come
out
once
or
twice
when
i
was
with
the
battalion
in
hampshire
the
bouts
had
been
short
for
i
had
known
of
their
coming
and
dosed
myself
but
now
i
had
no
quinine
and
it
looked
as
if
i
were
in
for
a
heavy
go
it
made
me
feel
desperately
wretched
and
stupid
and
i
all
but
blundered
into
capture
for
suddenly
i
came
on
a
road
and
was
going
to
cross
it
blindly
when
a
man
rode
slowly
past
on
a
bicycle
luckily
i
was
in
the
shade
of
a
clump
of
hollies
and
he
was
not
looking
my
way
though
he
was
not
three
yards
off
i
crawled
forward
to
reconnoitre
i
saw
about
half
a
mile
of
road
running
straight
through
the
forest
and
every
two
hundred
yards
was
a
bicyclist
they
wore
uniform
and
appeared
to
be
acting
as
sentries
this
could
only
have
one
meaning
stumm
had
picketed
all
the
roads
and
cut
me
off
in
an
angle
of
the
woods
there
was
no
chance
of
getting
across
unobserved
as
i
lay
there
with
my
heart
sinking
i
had
the
horrible
feeling
that
the
pursuit
might
be
following
me
from
behind
and
that
at
any
moment
i
would
be
enclosed
between
two
fires
for
more
than
an
hour
i
stayed
there
with
my
chin
in
the
snow
i
see
any
way
out
and
i
was
feeling
so
ill
that
i
did
seem
to
care
then
my
chance
came
suddenly
out
of
the
skies
the
wind
rose
and
a
great
gust
of
snow
blew
from
the
east
in
five
minutes
it
was
so
thick
that
i
could
see
across
the
road
at
first
i
thought
it
a
new
addition
to
my
troubles
and
then
very
slowly
i
saw
the
opportunity
i
slipped
down
the
bank
and
made
ready
to
cross
i
almost
blundered
into
one
of
the
bicyclists
he
cried
out
and
fell
off
his
machine
but
i
did
wait
to
investigate
a
sudden
access
of
strength
came
to
me
and
i
darted
into
the
woods
on
the
farther
side
i
knew
i
would
be
soon
swallowed
from
sight
in
the
drift
and
i
knew
that
the
falling
snow
would
hide
my
tracks
so
i
put
my
best
foot
forward
i
must
have
run
miles
before
the
hot
fit
passed
and
i
stopped
from
sheer
bodily
weakness
there
was
no
sound
except
the
crush
of
falling
snow
the
wind
seemed
to
have
gone
and
the
place
was
very
solemn
and
quiet
but
heavens
how
the
snow
fell
it
was
partly
screened
by
the
branches
but
all
the
same
it
was
piling
itself
up
deep
everywhere
my
legs
seemed
made
of
lead
my
head
burned
and
there
were
fiery
pains
over
all
my
body
i
stumbled
on
blindly
without
a
notion
of
any
direction
determined
only
to
keep
going
to
the
last
for
i
knew
that
if
i
once
lay
down
i
would
never
rise
again
when
i
was
a
boy
i
was
fond
of
fairy
tales
and
most
of
the
stories
i
remembered
had
been
about
great
german
forests
and
snow
and
charcoal
burners
and
woodmen
huts
once
i
had
longed
to
see
these
things
and
now
i
was
fairly
in
the
thick
of
them
there
had
been
wolves
too
and
i
wondered
idly
if
i
should
fall
in
with
a
pack
i
felt
myself
getting
i
fell
repeatedly
and
laughed
sillily
every
time
once
i
dropped
into
a
hole
and
lay
for
some
time
at
the
bottom
giggling
if
anyone
had
found
me
then
he
would
have
taken
me
for
a
madman
the
twilight
of
the
forest
grew
dimmer
but
i
scarcely
noticed
it
evening
was
falling
and
soon
it
would
be
night
a
night
without
morning
for
me
my
body
was
going
on
without
the
direction
of
my
brain
for
my
mind
was
filled
with
craziness
i
was
like
a
drunk
man
who
keeps
running
for
he
knows
that
if
he
stops
he
will
fall
and
i
had
a
sort
of
bet
with
myself
not
to
lie
down
not
at
any
rate
just
yet
if
i
lay
down
i
should
feel
the
pain
in
my
head
worse
once
i
had
ridden
for
five
days
down
country
with
fever
on
me
and
the
flat
bush
trees
had
seemed
to
melt
into
one
big
mirage
and
dance
quadrilles
before
my
eyes
but
then
i
had
more
or
less
kept
my
wits
now
i
was
fairly
daft
and
every
minute
growing
dafter
then
the
trees
seemed
to
stop
and
i
was
walking
on
flat
ground
it
was
a
clearing
and
before
me
twinkled
a
little
light
the
change
restored
me
to
consciousness
and
suddenly
i
felt
with
horrid
intensity
the
fire
in
my
head
and
bones
and
the
weakness
of
my
limbs
i
longed
to
sleep
and
i
had
a
notion
that
a
place
to
sleep
was
before
me
i
moved
towards
the
light
and
presently
saw
through
a
screen
of
snow
the
outline
of
a
cottage
i
had
no
fear
only
an
intolerable
longing
to
lie
down
very
slowly
i
made
my
way
to
the
door
and
knocked
my
weakness
was
so
great
that
i
could
hardly
lift
my
hand
there
were
voices
within
and
a
corner
of
the
curtain
was
lifted
from
the
window
then
the
door
opened
and
a
woman
stood
before
me
a
woman
with
a
thin
kindly
face
gott
she
said
while
children
peeped
from
behind
her
skirts
gott
i
replied
i
leaned
against
the
and
speech
forsook
me
she
saw
my
condition
in
sir
she
said
are
sick
and
it
is
no
weather
for
a
sick
man
i
stumbled
after
her
and
stood
dripping
in
the
centre
of
the
little
kitchen
while
three
wondering
children
stared
at
me
it
was
a
poor
place
scantily
furnished
but
a
good
burned
on
the
hearth
the
shock
of
warmth
gave
me
one
of
those
minutes
of
which
comes
sometimes
in
the
middle
of
a
fever
am
sick
mother
and
i
have
walked
far
in
the
storm
and
lost
my
way
i
am
from
africa
where
the
climate
is
hot
and
your
cold
brings
me
fever
it
will
pass
in
a
day
or
two
if
you
can
give
me
a
bed
are
welcome
she
said
first
i
will
make
you
coffee
i
took
off
my
dripping
cloak
and
crouched
close
to
the
hearth
she
gave
me
coffee
poor
washy
stuff
but
blessedly
hot
poverty
was
spelled
large
in
everything
i
saw
i
felt
the
tides
of
fever
beginning
to
overflow
my
brain
again
and
i
made
a
great
attempt
to
set
my
affairs
straight
before
i
was
overtaken
with
difficulty
i
took
out
stumm
pass
from
my
is
my
warrant
i
said
am
a
member
of
the
imperial
secret
service
and
for
the
sake
of
my
work
i
must
move
in
the
dark
if
you
will
permit
it
mother
i
will
sleep
till
i
am
better
but
no
one
must
know
that
i
am
here
if
anyone
comes
you
must
deny
my
presence
she
looked
at
the
big
seal
as
if
it
were
a
talisman
yes
she
said
will
have
the
bed
in
the
garret
and
be
left
in
peace
till
you
are
well
we
have
no
neighbours
near
and
the
storm
will
shut
the
roads
i
will
be
silent
i
and
the
little
ones
my
head
was
beginning
to
swim
but
i
made
one
more
effort
is
food
in
my
rucksack
biscuits
and
ham
and
chocolate
pray
take
it
for
your
use
and
here
is
some
money
to
buy
christmas
fare
for
the
little
ones
and
i
gave
her
some
of
the
german
notes
after
that
my
recollection
becomes
dim
she
helped
me
up
a
ladder
to
the
garret
undressed
me
and
gave
me
a
thick
coarse
nightgown
i
seem
to
remember
that
she
kissed
my
hand
and
that
she
was
crying
good
lord
has
sent
you
she
said
the
little
ones
will
have
their
prayers
answered
and
the
christkind
will
not
pass
by
our
door
chapter
eight
the
essen
barges
i
lay
for
four
days
like
a
log
in
that
garret
bed
the
storm
died
down
the
thaw
set
in
and
the
snow
melted
the
children
played
about
the
doors
and
told
stories
at
night
round
the
fire
stumm
myrmidons
no
doubt
beset
every
road
and
troubled
the
lives
of
innocent
wayfarers
but
no
one
came
near
the
cottage
and
the
fever
worked
itself
out
while
i
lay
in
peace
it
was
a
bad
bout
but
on
the
fifth
day
it
left
me
and
i
lay
as
weak
as
a
kitten
staring
at
the
rafters
and
the
little
skylight
it
was
a
leaky
draughty
old
place
but
the
woman
of
the
cottage
had
heaped
deerskins
and
blankets
on
my
bed
and
kept
me
warm
she
came
in
now
and
then
and
once
she
brought
me
a
brew
of
some
bitter
herbs
which
greatly
refreshed
me
a
little
thin
porridge
was
all
the
food
i
could
eat
and
some
chocolate
made
from
the
slabs
in
my
rucksack
i
lay
and
dozed
through
the
day
hearing
the
faint
chatter
of
children
below
and
getting
stronger
hourly
malaria
passes
as
quickly
as
it
comes
and
leaves
a
man
little
the
worse
though
this
was
one
of
the
sharpest
turns
i
ever
had
as
i
lay
i
thought
and
my
thoughts
followed
curious
lines
one
queer
thing
was
that
stumm
and
his
doings
seemed
to
have
been
shot
back
into
a
of
my
brain
and
the
door
locked
he
did
seem
to
be
a
creature
of
the
living
present
but
a
distant
memory
on
which
i
could
look
calmly
i
thought
a
good
deal
about
my
battalion
and
the
comedy
of
my
present
position
you
see
i
was
getting
better
for
i
called
it
comedy
now
not
tragedy
but
chiefly
i
thought
of
my
mission
all
that
wild
day
in
the
snow
it
had
seemed
the
merest
farce
the
three
words
harry
bullivant
had
scribbled
had
danced
through
my
head
in
a
crazy
fandango
they
were
present
to
me
now
but
coolly
and
sanely
in
all
their
meagreness
i
remember
that
i
took
each
one
separately
and
chewed
on
it
for
hours
there
was
nothing
to
be
got
out
of
that
there
were
too
many
meanings
all
blind
that
was
the
worst
gibberish
of
all
before
this
i
had
always
taken
the
i
as
the
letter
of
the
alphabet
i
had
thought
the
must
stand
for
von
and
i
had
considered
the
german
names
beginning
with
i
ingolstadt
ingeburg
ingenohl
and
all
the
rest
of
them
i
had
made
a
list
of
about
seventy
at
the
british
museum
before
i
left
london
now
i
suddenly
found
myself
taking
the
i
as
the
numeral
one
idly
not
thinking
what
i
was
doing
i
put
it
into
german
then
i
nearly
fell
out
of
the
bed
the
name
i
had
heard
at
gaudian
house
the
name
stumm
had
spoken
behind
his
hand
the
name
to
which
hilda
was
probably
the
prefix
it
was
a
tremendous
discovery
the
first
real
bit
of
light
i
had
found
harry
bullivant
knew
that
some
man
or
woman
called
von
einem
was
at
the
heart
of
the
mystery
stumm
had
spoken
of
the
same
personage
with
respect
and
in
connection
with
the
work
i
proposed
to
do
in
raising
the
moslem
africans
if
i
found
von
einem
i
would
be
getting
very
warm
what
was
the
word
that
stumm
had
whispered
to
gaudian
and
scared
that
worthy
it
had
sounded
like
if
i
could
only
get
that
clear
i
would
solve
the
riddle
i
think
that
discovery
completed
my
cure
at
any
rate
on
the
evening
of
the
fifth
day
it
was
wednesday
the
of
december
i
was
well
enough
to
get
up
when
the
dark
had
fallen
and
it
was
too
late
to
fear
a
visitor
i
came
downstairs
and
wrapped
in
my
green
cape
took
a
seat
by
the
fire
as
we
sat
there
in
the
firelight
with
the
three
children
staring
at
me
with
saucer
eyes
and
smiling
when
i
looked
their
way
the
woman
talked
her
man
had
gone
to
the
wars
on
the
eastern
front
and
the
last
she
had
heard
from
him
he
was
in
a
polish
bog
and
longing
for
his
dry
native
woodlands
the
struggle
meant
little
to
her
it
was
an
act
of
god
a
thunderbolt
out
of
the
sky
which
had
taken
a
husband
from
her
and
might
soon
make
her
a
widow
and
her
children
fatherless
she
knew
nothing
of
its
causes
and
purposes
and
thought
of
the
russians
as
a
gigantic
nation
of
savages
heathens
who
had
never
been
converted
and
who
would
eat
up
german
homes
if
the
good
lord
and
the
brave
german
soldiers
did
not
stop
them
i
tried
hard
to
find
out
if
she
had
any
notion
of
affairs
in
the
west
but
she
had
beyond
the
fact
that
there
was
trouble
with
the
french
i
doubt
if
she
knew
of
england
share
in
it
she
was
a
decent
soul
with
no
bitterness
against
anybody
not
even
the
russians
if
they
would
spare
her
man
that
night
i
realized
the
crazy
folly
of
war
when
i
saw
the
splintered
shell
of
ypres
and
heard
hideous
tales
of
german
doings
i
used
to
want
to
see
the
whole
land
of
the
boche
given
up
to
fire
and
sword
i
thought
we
could
never
end
the
war
properly
without
giving
the
huns
some
of
their
own
medicine
but
that
woodcutter
cottage
cured
me
of
such
nightmares
i
was
for
punishing
the
guilty
but
letting
the
innocent
go
free
it
was
our
business
to
thank
god
and
keep
our
hands
clean
from
the
ugly
blunders
to
which
germany
madness
had
driven
her
what
good
would
it
do
christian
folk
to
burn
poor
little
huts
like
this
and
leave
children
bodies
by
the
wayside
to
be
able
to
laugh
and
to
be
merciful
are
the
only
things
that
make
man
better
than
the
beasts
the
place
as
i
have
said
was
desperately
poor
the
woman
face
had
the
skin
stretched
tight
over
the
bones
and
that
transparency
which
means
i
fancied
she
did
not
have
the
liberal
allowance
that
soldiers
wives
get
in
england
the
children
looked
better
nourished
but
it
was
by
their
mother
sacrifice
i
did
my
best
to
cheer
them
up
i
told
them
long
yarns
about
africa
and
lions
and
tigers
and
i
got
some
pieces
of
wood
and
whittled
them
into
toys
i
am
fairly
good
with
a
knife
and
i
carved
very
presentable
likenesses
of
a
monkey
a
springbok
and
a
rhinoceros
the
children
went
to
bed
hugging
the
first
toys
i
expect
they
ever
possessed
it
was
clear
to
me
that
i
must
leave
as
soon
as
possible
i
had
to
get
on
with
my
business
and
besides
it
was
not
fair
to
the
woman
any
moment
i
might
be
found
here
and
she
would
get
into
trouble
for
harbouring
me
i
asked
her
if
she
knew
where
the
danube
was
and
her
answer
surprised
me
will
reach
it
in
an
hour
walk
she
said
track
through
the
wood
runs
straight
to
the
ferry
next
morning
after
breakfast
i
took
my
departure
it
was
drizzling
weather
and
i
was
feeling
very
lean
before
going
i
presented
my
hostess
and
the
children
with
two
sovereigns
apiece
is
english
gold
i
said
i
have
to
travel
among
our
enemies
and
use
our
enemies
money
but
the
gold
is
good
and
if
you
go
to
any
town
they
will
change
it
for
you
but
i
advise
you
to
put
it
in
your
and
use
it
only
if
all
else
fails
you
must
keep
your
home
going
for
some
day
there
will
be
peace
and
your
man
will
come
back
from
the
wars
i
kissed
the
children
shook
the
woman
hand
and
went
off
down
the
clearing
they
had
cried
wiedersehen
but
it
was
likely
i
would
ever
see
them
again
the
snow
had
all
gone
except
in
patches
in
the
deep
hollows
the
ground
was
like
a
full
sponge
and
a
cold
rain
drifted
in
my
eyes
after
half
an
hour
steady
trudge
the
trees
thinned
and
presently
i
came
out
on
a
knuckle
of
open
ground
cloaked
in
dwarf
junipers
and
there
before
me
lay
the
plain
and
a
mile
off
a
broad
brimming
river
i
sat
down
and
looked
dismally
at
the
prospect
the
exhilaration
of
my
discovery
the
day
before
had
gone
i
had
stumbled
on
a
worthless
piece
of
knowledge
for
i
could
not
use
it
hilda
von
einem
if
such
a
person
existed
and
possessed
the
great
secret
was
probably
living
in
some
big
house
in
berlin
and
i
was
about
as
likely
to
get
anything
out
of
her
as
to
be
asked
to
dine
with
the
kaiser
blenkiron
might
do
something
but
where
on
earth
was
blenkiron
i
dared
say
sir
walter
would
value
the
information
but
i
could
not
get
to
sir
walter
i
was
to
go
on
to
constantinople
running
away
from
the
people
who
really
pulled
the
ropes
but
if
i
stayed
i
could
do
nothing
and
i
could
not
stay
i
must
go
on
and
i
did
see
how
i
could
go
on
every
course
seemed
shut
to
me
and
i
was
in
as
pretty
a
tangle
as
any
man
ever
stumbled
into
for
i
was
morally
certain
that
stumm
would
not
let
the
thing
drop
i
knew
too
much
and
besides
i
had
outraged
his
pride
he
would
beat
the
countryside
till
he
got
me
and
he
undoubtedly
would
get
me
if
i
waited
much
longer
but
how
was
i
to
get
over
the
border
my
passport
would
be
no
good
for
the
number
of
that
pass
would
long
ere
this
have
been
wired
to
every
in
germany
and
to
produce
it
would
be
to
ask
for
trouble
without
it
i
could
not
cross
the
borders
by
any
railway
my
studies
of
the
tourists
guide
had
suggested
that
once
i
was
in
austria
i
might
find
things
slacker
and
move
about
easier
i
thought
of
having
a
try
at
the
tyrol
and
i
also
thought
of
bohemia
but
these
places
were
a
long
way
off
and
there
were
several
thousand
chances
each
day
that
i
would
be
caught
on
the
road
this
was
thursday
the
of
december
the
second
last
day
of
the
year
i
was
due
in
constantinople
on
the
of
january
constantinople
i
had
thought
myself
a
long
way
from
it
in
berlin
but
now
it
seemed
as
distant
as
the
moon
but
that
big
sullen
river
in
front
of
me
led
to
it
and
as
i
looked
my
attention
was
caught
by
a
curious
sight
on
the
far
eastern
horizon
where
the
water
slipped
round
a
corner
of
hill
there
was
a
long
trail
of
smoke
the
streamers
thinned
out
and
seemed
to
come
from
some
boat
well
round
the
corner
but
i
could
see
at
least
two
boats
in
view
therefore
there
must
be
a
long
train
of
barges
with
a
tug
in
tow
i
looked
to
the
west
and
saw
another
such
procession
coming
into
sight
first
went
a
big
river
steamer
it
ca
have
been
much
less
than
tons
and
after
came
a
string
of
barges
i
counted
no
less
than
six
besides
the
tug
they
were
heavily
loaded
and
their
draught
must
have
been
considerable
but
there
was
plenty
of
depth
in
the
flooded
river
a
moment
reflection
told
me
what
i
was
looking
at
once
sandy
in
one
of
the
discussions
you
have
in
hospital
had
told
us
just
how
the
germans
munitioned
their
balkan
campaign
they
were
pretty
certain
of
dishing
serbia
at
the
first
go
and
it
was
up
to
them
to
get
through
guns
and
shells
to
the
old
turk
who
was
running
pretty
short
in
his
first
supply
sandy
said
that
they
wanted
the
railway
but
they
wanted
still
more
the
river
and
they
could
make
certain
of
that
in
a
week
he
told
us
how
endless
strings
of
barges
loaded
up
at
the
big
factories
of
westphalia
were
moving
through
the
canals
from
the
rhine
or
the
elbe
to
the
danube
once
the
first
reached
turkey
there
would
be
regular
delivery
you
see
as
quick
as
the
turks
could
handle
the
stuff
and
they
did
return
empty
sandy
said
but
came
back
full
of
turkish
cotton
and
bulgarian
beef
and
rumanian
corn
i
do
know
where
sandy
got
the
knowledge
but
there
was
the
proof
of
it
before
my
eyes
it
was
a
wonderful
sight
and
i
could
have
gnashed
my
teeth
to
see
those
loads
of
munitions
going
snugly
off
to
the
enemy
i
calculated
they
would
give
our
poor
chaps
hell
in
gallipoli
and
then
as
i
looked
an
idea
came
into
my
head
and
with
it
an
eighth
part
of
a
hope
there
was
only
one
way
for
me
to
get
out
of
germany
and
that
was
to
leave
in
such
good
company
that
i
would
be
asked
no
questions
that
was
plain
enough
if
i
travelled
to
turkey
for
instance
in
the
kaiser
suite
i
would
be
as
safe
as
the
mail
but
if
i
went
on
my
own
i
was
done
i
had
so
to
speak
to
get
my
passport
inside
germany
to
join
some
caravan
which
had
free
marching
powers
and
there
was
the
kind
of
caravan
before
me
the
essen
barges
it
sounded
lunacy
for
i
guessed
that
munitions
of
war
would
be
as
jealously
guarded
as
old
hindenburg
health
all
the
safer
i
replied
to
myself
once
i
get
there
if
you
are
looking
for
a
deserter
you
do
seek
him
at
the
favourite
regimental
if
after
a
thief
among
the
places
you
be
apt
to
leave
unsearched
would
be
scotland
yard
it
was
sound
reasoning
but
how
was
i
to
get
on
board
probably
the
beastly
things
did
not
stop
once
in
a
hundred
miles
and
stumm
would
get
me
long
before
i
struck
a
and
even
if
i
did
get
a
chance
like
that
how
was
i
to
get
permission
to
travel
one
step
was
clearly
indicated
to
get
down
to
the
river
bank
at
once
so
i
set
off
at
a
sharp
walk
across
squelchy
fields
till
i
struck
a
road
where
the
ditches
had
overflowed
so
as
almost
to
meet
in
the
middle
the
place
was
so
bad
that
i
hoped
travellers
might
be
few
and
as
i
trudged
my
thoughts
were
busy
with
my
prospects
as
a
stowaway
if
i
bought
food
i
might
get
a
chance
to
lie
snug
on
one
of
the
barges
they
would
not
break
bulk
till
they
got
to
their
journey
end
suddenly
i
noticed
that
the
steamer
which
was
now
abreast
me
began
to
move
towards
the
shore
and
as
i
came
over
a
low
rise
i
saw
on
my
left
a
straggling
village
with
a
church
and
a
small
the
houses
stood
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
stream
and
between
them
was
a
straight
road
soon
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
it
the
procession
was
coming
to
a
standstill
the
big
tug
nosed
her
way
in
and
lay
up
alongside
the
pier
where
in
that
season
of
flood
there
was
enough
depth
of
water
she
signalled
to
the
barges
and
they
also
started
to
drop
anchors
which
showed
that
there
must
be
at
least
two
men
aboard
each
some
of
them
dragged
a
bit
and
it
was
rather
a
train
that
lay
in
the
tug
got
out
a
gangway
and
from
where
i
lay
i
saw
half
a
dozen
men
leave
it
carrying
something
on
their
shoulders
it
could
be
only
one
thing
a
dead
body
someone
of
the
crew
must
have
died
and
this
halt
was
to
bury
him
i
watched
the
procession
move
towards
the
village
and
i
reckoned
they
would
take
some
time
there
though
they
might
have
wired
ahead
for
a
grave
to
be
dug
anyhow
they
would
be
long
enough
to
give
me
a
chance
for
i
had
decided
upon
the
brazen
course
blenkiron
had
said
you
could
cheat
the
boche
but
you
could
bluff
him
i
was
going
to
put
up
the
most
monstrous
bluff
if
the
whole
countryside
was
hunting
for
richard
hannay
richard
hannay
would
walk
through
as
a
pal
of
the
hunters
for
i
remembered
the
pass
stumm
had
given
me
if
that
was
worth
a
tinker
curse
it
should
be
good
enough
to
impress
a
captain
of
course
there
were
a
thousand
risks
they
might
have
heard
of
me
in
the
village
and
told
the
ship
party
the
story
for
that
reason
i
resolved
not
to
go
there
but
to
meet
the
sailors
when
they
were
returning
to
the
boat
or
the
captain
might
have
been
warned
and
got
the
number
of
my
pass
in
which
case
stumm
would
have
his
hands
on
me
pretty
soon
or
the
captain
might
be
an
ignorant
fellow
who
had
never
seen
a
secret
service
pass
and
did
not
know
what
it
meant
and
would
refuse
me
transport
by
the
letter
of
his
instructions
in
that
case
i
might
wait
on
another
convoy
i
had
shaved
and
made
myself
a
fairly
respectable
figure
before
i
left
the
cottage
it
was
my
cue
to
wait
for
the
men
when
they
left
the
church
wait
on
that
of
straight
highway
i
judged
the
captain
must
be
in
the
party
the
village
i
was
glad
to
observe
seemed
very
empty
i
have
my
own
notions
about
the
bavarians
as
fighting
men
but
i
am
bound
to
say
that
judging
by
my
observations
very
few
of
them
stayed
at
home
that
funeral
took
hours
they
must
have
had
to
dig
the
grave
for
i
waited
near
the
road
in
a
clump
of
with
my
feet
in
two
inches
of
mud
and
water
till
i
felt
chilled
to
the
bone
i
prayed
to
god
it
would
not
bring
back
my
fever
for
i
was
only
one
day
out
of
bed
i
had
very
little
tobacco
left
in
my
pouch
but
i
stood
myself
one
pipe
and
i
ate
one
of
the
three
cakes
of
chocolate
i
still
carried
at
last
well
after
midday
i
could
see
the
ship
party
returning
they
marched
two
by
two
and
i
was
thankful
to
see
that
they
had
no
villagers
with
them
i
walked
to
the
road
turned
up
it
and
met
the
vanguard
carrying
my
head
as
high
as
i
knew
how
your
captain
i
asked
and
a
man
jerked
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
the
others
wore
thick
jerseys
and
knitted
caps
but
there
was
one
man
at
the
rear
in
uniform
he
was
a
short
broad
man
with
a
face
and
an
anxious
eye
i
have
a
word
with
you
herr
captain
i
said
with
what
i
hoped
was
a
judicious
blend
of
authority
and
conciliation
he
nodded
to
his
companion
who
walked
on
he
asked
rather
impatiently
i
proffered
him
my
pass
thank
heaven
he
had
seen
the
kind
of
thing
before
for
his
face
at
once
took
on
that
curious
look
which
one
person
in
authority
always
wears
when
he
is
confronted
with
another
he
studied
it
closely
and
then
raised
his
eyes
sir
he
said
observe
your
credentials
what
can
i
do
for
you
take
it
you
are
bound
for
constantinople
i
asked
boats
go
as
far
as
rustchuk
he
replied
the
stuff
is
transferred
to
the
railway
you
reach
rustchuk
when
ten
days
bar
accidents
let
us
say
twelve
to
be
safe
want
to
accompany
you
i
said
my
profession
herr
captain
it
is
necessary
sometimes
to
make
journeys
by
other
than
the
common
route
that
is
now
my
desire
i
have
the
right
to
call
upon
some
other
branch
of
our
country
service
to
help
me
hence
my
request
very
plainly
he
did
not
like
it
must
telegraph
about
it
my
instructions
are
to
let
no
one
aboard
not
even
a
man
like
you
i
am
sorry
sir
but
i
must
get
authority
first
before
i
can
fall
in
with
your
desire
besides
my
boat
is
you
had
better
wait
for
the
next
batch
and
ask
dreyser
to
take
you
i
lost
walter
today
he
was
ill
when
he
came
aboard
a
disease
of
the
heart
but
he
would
not
be
persuaded
and
last
night
he
died
that
him
you
have
been
burying
i
asked
so
he
was
a
good
man
and
my
wife
cousin
and
now
i
have
no
engineer
only
a
fool
of
a
boy
from
hamburg
i
have
just
come
from
wiring
to
my
owners
for
a
fresh
man
but
even
if
he
comes
by
the
quickest
train
he
will
scarcely
overtake
us
before
vienna
or
even
buda
i
saw
light
at
last
will
go
together
i
said
cancel
that
wire
for
behold
herr
captain
i
am
an
engineer
and
will
gladly
keep
an
eye
on
your
boilers
till
we
get
to
rustchuk
he
looked
at
me
doubtfully
am
speaking
truth
i
said
the
war
i
was
an
engineer
in
damaraland
mining
was
my
branch
but
i
had
a
good
general
training
and
i
know
enough
to
run
a
have
no
fear
i
promise
you
i
will
earn
my
passage
his
face
cleared
and
he
looked
what
he
was
an
honest
north
german
seaman
then
in
god
name
he
cried
we
will
make
a
bargain
i
will
let
the
telegraph
sleep
i
require
authority
from
the
government
to
take
a
passenger
but
i
need
none
to
engage
a
new
engineer
he
sent
one
of
the
hands
back
to
the
village
to
cancel
his
wire
in
ten
minutes
i
found
myself
on
board
and
ten
minutes
later
we
were
out
in
and
our
tows
were
lumbering
into
line
coffee
was
being
made
ready
in
the
cabin
and
while
i
waited
for
it
i
picked
up
the
binoculars
and
scanned
the
place
i
had
left
i
saw
some
curious
things
on
the
first
road
i
had
struck
on
leaving
the
cottage
there
were
men
on
bicycles
moving
rapidly
they
seemed
to
wear
uniform
on
the
next
parallel
road
the
one
that
ran
through
the
village
i
could
see
others
i
noticed
too
that
several
figures
appeared
to
be
beating
the
intervening
fields
stumm
cordon
had
got
busy
at
last
and
i
thanked
my
stars
that
not
one
of
the
villagers
had
seen
me
i
had
not
got
away
much
too
soon
for
in
another
he
would
have
had
me
chapter
nine
the
return
of
the
straggler
before
i
turned
in
that
evening
i
had
done
some
good
hours
work
in
the
the
boat
was
and
in
very
fair
order
so
my
duties
did
not
look
as
if
they
would
be
heavy
there
was
nobody
who
could
be
properly
called
an
engineer
only
besides
the
a
couple
of
lads
from
hamburg
who
had
been
a
year
ago
apprentices
in
a
yard
they
were
civil
fellows
both
of
them
consumptive
who
did
what
i
told
them
and
said
little
by
bedtime
if
you
had
seen
me
in
my
blue
jumper
a
pair
of
carpet
slippers
and
a
flat
cap
all
the
property
of
the
deceased
walter
you
would
have
sworn
i
had
been
bred
to
the
firing
of
whereas
i
had
acquired
most
of
my
knowledge
on
one
run
down
the
zambesi
when
the
proper
engineer
got
drunk
and
fell
overboard
among
the
crocodiles
the
captain
they
called
him
schenk
was
out
of
his
bearings
in
the
job
he
was
a
frisian
and
a
seaman
but
since
he
knew
the
rhine
delta
and
because
the
german
mercantile
marine
was
laid
on
the
ice
till
the
end
of
war
they
had
turned
him
on
to
this
show
he
was
bored
by
the
business
and
did
understand
it
very
well
the
river
charts
puzzled
him
and
though
it
was
pretty
plain
going
for
hundreds
of
miles
yet
he
was
in
a
perpetual
fidget
about
the
pilotage
you
could
see
that
he
would
have
been
far
more
in
his
element
smelling
his
way
through
the
shoals
of
the
ems
mouth
or
beating
against
a
northeaster
in
the
shallow
baltic
he
had
six
barges
in
tow
but
the
heavy
flood
of
the
danube
made
it
an
easy
job
except
when
it
came
to
going
slow
there
were
two
men
on
each
barge
who
came
aboard
every
morning
to
draw
rations
that
was
a
funny
business
for
we
never
lay
to
if
we
could
help
it
there
was
a
dinghy
belonging
to
each
barge
and
the
men
used
to
row
to
the
next
and
get
a
lift
in
that
barge
dinghy
and
so
forth
six
men
would
appear
in
the
dinghy
of
the
barge
nearest
us
and
carry
off
supplies
for
the
rest
the
men
were
mostly
frisians
lads
very
like
the
breed
you
strike
on
the
essex
coast
it
was
the
fact
that
schenk
was
really
a
sailor
and
so
a
novice
to
the
job
that
made
me
get
on
with
him
he
was
a
good
fellow
and
quite
willing
to
take
a
hint
so
before
i
had
been
hours
on
board
he
was
telling
me
all
his
difficulties
and
i
was
doing
my
best
to
cheer
him
and
difficulties
came
thick
because
the
next
night
was
new
year
eve
i
knew
that
that
night
was
a
season
of
gaiety
in
scotland
but
scotland
was
in
it
with
the
fatherland
even
schenk
though
he
was
in
charge
of
valuable
stores
and
was
voyaging
against
time
was
quite
clear
that
the
men
must
have
permission
for
some
kind
of
beano
just
before
darkness
we
came
abreast
a
town
whose
name
i
never
discovered
and
decided
to
lie
to
for
the
night
the
arrangement
was
that
one
man
should
be
left
on
guard
in
each
barge
and
the
other
get
four
hours
leave
ashore
then
he
would
return
and
relieve
his
friend
who
should
proceed
to
do
the
same
thing
i
foresaw
that
there
would
be
some
fun
when
the
first
batch
returned
but
i
did
not
dare
to
protest
i
was
desperately
anxious
to
get
past
the
austrian
frontier
for
i
had
a
we
might
be
searched
there
but
schenk
took
his
business
so
seriously
that
i
would
have
risked
a
row
if
i
had
tried
to
argue
the
upshot
was
what
i
expected
we
got
the
first
batch
aboard
about
midnight
blind
to
the
world
and
the
others
straggled
in
at
all
hours
next
morning
i
stuck
to
the
boat
for
obvious
reasons
but
next
day
it
became
too
serious
and
i
had
to
go
ashore
with
the
captain
to
try
and
round
up
the
stragglers
we
got
them
all
in
but
two
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
these
two
had
never
meant
to
come
back
if
i
had
a
soft
job
like
a
i
should
be
inclined
to
run
away
in
the
middle
of
germany
with
the
certainty
that
my
best
fate
would
be
to
be
scooped
up
for
the
trenches
but
your
frisian
has
no
more
imagination
than
a
haddock
the
absentees
were
both
watchmen
from
the
barges
and
i
fancy
the
monotony
of
the
life
had
got
on
their
nerves
the
captain
was
in
a
raging
temper
for
he
was
to
begin
with
he
would
have
started
a
but
there
was
no
superfluity
of
men
in
that
township
nothing
but
boys
and
grandfathers
as
i
was
helping
to
run
the
trip
i
was
pretty
annoyed
also
and
i
sluiced
down
the
drunkards
with
icy
danube
water
using
all
the
worst
language
i
knew
in
dutch
and
german
it
was
a
raw
morning
and
as
we
raged
through
the
streets
i
remember
i
heard
the
dry
crackle
of
wild
geese
going
overhead
and
wished
i
could
get
a
shot
at
them
i
told
one
fellow
he
was
the
most
troublesome
that
he
was
a
disgrace
to
a
great
empire
and
was
only
fit
to
fight
with
the
filthy
english
in
heaven
said
the
captain
can
delay
no
longer
we
must
make
shift
the
best
we
can
i
can
spare
one
man
from
the
deck
hands
and
you
must
give
up
one
from
the
that
was
arranged
and
we
were
tearing
back
rather
short
in
the
wind
when
i
espied
a
figure
sitting
on
a
bench
beside
the
on
the
pier
it
was
a
slim
figure
in
an
old
suit
of
khaki
some
duds
which
had
long
lost
the
semblance
of
a
uniform
it
had
a
gentle
face
and
was
smoking
peacefully
looking
out
upon
the
river
and
the
boats
and
us
noisy
fellows
with
meek
philosophical
eyes
if
i
had
seen
general
french
sitting
there
and
looking
like
nothing
on
earth
i
could
have
been
more
surprised
the
man
stared
at
me
without
recognition
he
was
waiting
for
his
cue
i
spoke
rapidly
in
sesutu
for
i
was
afraid
the
captain
might
know
dutch
have
you
come
from
i
asked
shut
me
up
in
said
peter
i
ran
away
i
am
tired
cornelis
and
want
to
continue
the
journey
by
boat
you
have
worked
for
me
in
africa
i
said
are
just
home
from
damaraland
you
are
a
german
who
has
lived
thirty
years
away
from
home
you
can
tend
a
furnace
and
have
worked
in
mines
then
i
spoke
to
the
captain
is
a
fellow
who
used
to
be
in
my
employ
captain
schenk
almighty
luck
we
struck
him
he
old
and
not
very
strong
in
the
head
but
i
go
bail
he
a
good
worker
he
says
he
come
with
us
and
i
can
use
him
in
the
up
said
the
captain
peter
stood
up
light
and
slim
and
wiry
as
a
leopard
a
sailor
does
not
judge
men
by
girth
and
weight
do
said
schenk
and
the
next
minute
he
was
readjusting
his
crews
and
giving
the
strayed
revellers
the
rough
side
of
his
tongue
as
it
chanced
i
could
keep
peter
with
me
but
had
to
send
him
to
one
of
the
barges
and
i
had
time
for
no
more
than
five
words
with
him
when
i
told
him
to
hold
his
tongue
and
live
up
to
his
reputation
as
a
that
accursed
had
played
havoc
with
the
whole
outfit
and
the
captain
and
i
were
weary
men
before
we
got
things
straight
in
one
way
it
turned
out
well
that
afternoon
we
passed
the
frontier
and
i
never
knew
it
till
i
saw
a
man
in
a
strange
uniform
come
aboard
who
copied
some
figures
on
a
schedule
and
brought
us
a
mail
with
my
dirty
face
and
general
air
of
absorption
in
duty
i
must
have
been
an
unsuspicious
figure
he
took
down
the
names
of
the
men
in
the
barges
and
peter
name
was
given
as
it
appeared
on
the
ship
roll
anton
blum
must
feel
it
strange
herr
brandt
said
the
captain
be
scrutinized
by
a
policeman
you
who
give
orders
i
doubt
not
to
many
policemen
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
is
my
profession
it
is
my
business
to
go
unrecognized
often
by
my
own
servants
i
could
see
that
i
was
becoming
rather
a
figure
in
the
captain
eyes
he
liked
the
way
i
kept
the
men
up
to
their
work
for
i
had
been
a
for
nothing
late
on
that
sunday
night
we
passed
through
a
great
city
which
the
captain
told
me
was
vienna
it
seemed
to
last
for
miles
and
miles
and
to
be
as
brightly
lit
as
a
circus
after
that
we
were
in
big
plains
and
the
air
grew
perishing
cold
peter
had
come
aboard
once
for
his
rations
but
usually
he
left
it
to
his
partner
for
he
was
lying
very
low
but
one
morning
i
think
it
was
the
of
january
when
we
had
passed
buda
and
were
moving
through
great
sodden
flats
just
sprinkled
with
snow
the
captain
took
it
into
his
head
to
get
me
to
overhaul
the
barge
loads
armed
with
a
mighty
list
i
made
a
tour
of
the
barges
beginning
with
the
hindmost
there
was
a
fine
old
stock
of
deadly
weapons
mostly
and
some
and
enough
shells
to
blow
up
the
gallipoli
peninsula
all
kinds
of
shell
were
there
from
the
big
crumps
to
rifle
grenades
and
it
made
me
fairly
sick
to
see
all
these
good
things
preparing
for
our
own
fellows
and
i
wondered
whether
i
would
not
be
doing
my
best
service
if
i
engineered
a
big
explosion
happily
i
had
the
common
sense
to
remember
my
job
and
my
duty
and
to
stick
to
it
peter
was
in
the
middle
of
the
convoy
and
i
found
him
pretty
unhappy
principally
through
not
being
allowed
to
smoke
his
companion
was
an
lad
whom
i
ordered
to
the
while
peter
and
i
went
over
the
lists
my
old
friend
he
said
are
some
pretty
toys
here
with
a
spanner
and
a
couple
of
clear
hours
i
could
make
these
maxims
about
as
deadly
as
bicycles
what
do
you
say
to
a
try
considered
that
i
said
it
wo
do
we
on
a
bigger
business
than
wrecking
munition
convoys
i
want
to
know
how
you
got
here
he
smiled
with
that
extraordinary
docility
of
his
was
very
simple
cornelis
i
was
foolish
in
the
cafe
but
they
have
told
you
of
that
you
see
i
was
angry
and
did
not
reflect
they
had
separated
us
and
i
could
see
would
treat
me
as
dirt
therefore
my
bad
temper
came
out
for
as
i
have
told
you
i
do
not
like
germans
peter
gazed
lovingly
at
the
little
bleak
farms
which
dotted
the
hungarian
plain
night
i
lay
in
with
no
food
in
the
morning
they
fed
me
and
took
me
hundreds
of
miles
in
a
train
to
a
place
which
i
think
is
called
neuburg
it
was
a
great
prison
full
of
english
officers
i
asked
myself
many
times
on
the
journey
what
was
the
reason
of
this
treatment
for
i
could
see
no
sense
in
it
if
they
wanted
to
punish
me
for
insulting
them
they
had
the
chance
to
send
me
off
to
the
trenches
no
one
could
have
objected
if
they
thought
me
useless
they
could
have
turned
me
back
to
holland
i
could
not
have
stopped
them
but
they
treated
me
as
if
i
were
a
dangerous
man
whereas
all
their
conduct
hitherto
had
shown
that
they
thought
me
a
fool
i
could
not
understand
it
i
had
not
been
one
night
in
that
neuburg
place
before
i
thought
of
the
reason
they
wanted
to
keep
me
under
observation
as
a
check
upon
you
cornelis
i
figured
it
out
this
way
they
had
given
you
some
very
important
work
which
required
them
to
let
you
into
some
big
secret
so
far
good
they
evidently
thought
much
of
you
even
yon
stumm
man
though
he
was
as
rude
as
a
buffalo
but
they
did
not
know
you
fully
and
they
wanted
to
check
on
you
that
check
they
found
in
peter
pienaar
peter
was
a
fool
and
if
there
was
anything
to
blab
sooner
or
later
peter
would
blab
it
then
they
would
stretch
out
a
long
arm
and
nip
you
short
wherever
you
were
therefore
they
must
keep
old
peter
under
their
eye
sounds
likely
enough
i
said
was
god
truth
said
peter
when
it
was
all
clear
to
me
i
settled
that
i
must
escape
partly
because
i
am
a
free
man
and
do
not
like
to
be
in
prison
but
mostly
because
i
was
not
sure
of
myself
some
day
my
temper
would
go
again
and
i
might
say
foolish
things
for
which
cornelis
would
suffer
so
it
was
very
certain
that
i
must
escape
cornelis
i
noticed
pretty
soon
that
there
were
two
kinds
among
the
prisoners
there
were
the
real
prisoners
mostly
english
and
french
and
there
were
humbugs
the
humbugs
were
treated
apparently
like
the
others
but
not
really
as
i
soon
perceived
there
was
one
man
who
passed
as
an
english
officer
another
as
a
french
canadian
and
the
others
called
themselves
russians
none
of
the
honest
men
suspected
them
but
they
were
there
as
spies
to
hatch
plots
for
escape
and
get
the
poor
devils
caught
in
the
act
and
to
worm
out
confidences
which
might
be
of
value
that
is
the
german
notion
of
good
business
i
am
not
a
british
soldier
to
think
all
men
are
gentlemen
i
know
that
amongst
men
there
are
desperate
so
i
soon
picked
up
this
game
it
made
me
very
angry
but
it
was
a
good
thing
for
my
plan
i
made
my
resolution
to
escape
the
day
i
arrived
at
neuburg
and
on
christmas
day
i
had
a
plan
made
you
an
old
marvel
do
you
mean
to
say
you
were
quite
certain
of
getting
away
whenever
you
wanted
certain
cornelis
you
see
i
have
been
wicked
in
my
time
and
know
something
about
the
inside
of
prisons
you
may
build
them
like
great
castles
or
they
may
be
like
a
backveld
only
mud
and
corrugated
iron
but
there
is
always
a
key
and
a
man
who
keeps
it
and
that
man
can
be
bested
i
knew
i
could
get
away
but
i
did
not
think
it
would
be
so
easy
that
was
due
to
the
bogus
prisoners
my
friends
the
spies
made
great
pals
with
them
on
christmas
night
we
were
very
jolly
together
i
think
i
spotted
every
one
of
them
the
first
day
i
bragged
about
my
past
and
all
i
had
done
and
i
told
them
i
was
going
to
escape
they
backed
me
up
and
promised
to
help
next
morning
i
had
a
plan
in
the
afternoon
just
after
dinner
i
had
to
go
to
the
commandant
room
they
treated
me
a
little
differently
from
the
others
for
i
was
not
a
prisoner
of
war
and
i
went
there
to
be
asked
questions
and
to
be
cursed
as
a
stupid
dutchman
there
was
no
strict
guard
kept
there
for
the
place
was
on
the
second
floor
and
distant
by
many
yards
from
any
staircase
in
the
corridor
outside
the
commandant
room
there
was
a
window
which
had
no
bars
and
four
feet
from
the
window
the
limb
of
a
great
tree
a
man
might
reach
that
limb
and
if
he
were
active
as
a
monkey
might
descend
to
the
ground
beyond
that
i
knew
nothing
but
i
am
a
good
climber
cornelis
told
the
others
of
my
plan
they
said
it
was
good
but
no
one
offered
to
come
with
me
they
were
very
noble
they
declared
that
the
scheme
was
mine
and
i
should
have
the
fruit
of
it
for
if
more
than
one
tried
detection
was
certain
i
agreed
and
thanked
them
thanked
them
with
tears
in
my
eyes
then
one
of
them
very
secretly
produced
a
map
we
planned
out
my
road
for
i
was
going
straight
to
holland
it
was
a
long
road
and
i
had
no
money
for
they
had
taken
all
my
sovereigns
when
i
was
arrested
but
they
promised
to
get
a
subscription
up
among
themselves
to
start
me
again
i
wept
tears
of
gratitude
this
was
on
sunday
the
day
after
christmas
and
i
settled
to
make
the
attempt
on
the
wednesday
afternoon
cornelis
when
the
lieutenant
took
us
to
see
the
british
prisoners
you
remember
he
told
us
many
things
about
the
ways
of
prisons
he
told
us
how
they
loved
to
catch
a
man
in
the
act
of
escape
so
that
they
could
use
him
harshly
with
a
clear
conscience
i
thought
of
that
and
calculated
that
now
my
friends
would
have
told
everything
to
the
commandant
and
that
they
would
be
waiting
to
bottle
me
on
the
wednesday
till
then
i
reckoned
i
would
be
slackly
guarded
for
they
would
look
on
me
as
safe
in
the
net
i
went
out
of
the
window
next
day
it
was
the
monday
afternoon
was
a
bold
stroke
i
said
admiringly
plan
was
bold
but
it
was
not
skilful
said
peter
modestly
had
no
money
beyond
seven
marks
and
i
had
but
one
stick
of
chocolate
i
had
no
overcoat
and
it
was
snowing
hard
further
i
could
not
get
down
the
tree
which
had
a
trunk
as
smooth
and
branchless
as
a
blue
gum
for
a
little
i
thought
i
should
be
compelled
to
give
in
and
i
was
not
happy
i
had
leisure
for
i
did
not
think
i
would
be
missed
before
nightfall
and
given
time
a
man
can
do
most
things
by
and
by
i
found
a
branch
which
led
beyond
the
outer
wall
of
the
yard
and
hung
above
the
river
this
i
followed
and
then
dropped
from
it
into
the
stream
it
was
a
drop
of
some
yards
and
the
water
was
very
swift
so
that
i
nearly
drowned
i
would
rather
swim
the
limpopo
cornelis
among
all
the
crocodiles
than
that
icy
river
yet
i
managed
to
reach
the
shore
and
get
my
breath
lying
in
the
bushes
that
it
was
plain
going
though
i
was
very
cold
i
knew
that
i
would
be
sought
on
the
northern
roads
as
i
had
told
my
friends
for
no
one
could
dream
of
an
ignorant
dutchman
going
south
away
from
his
kinsfolk
but
i
had
learned
enough
from
the
map
to
know
that
our
road
lay
and
i
had
marked
this
big
river
you
hope
to
pick
me
up
i
asked
cornelis
i
thought
you
would
be
travelling
in
carriages
while
i
should
be
plodding
on
foot
but
i
was
set
on
getting
to
the
place
you
spoke
of
how
do
you
call
it
constant
nople
where
our
big
business
lay
i
thought
i
might
be
in
time
for
that
an
old
trojan
peter
i
said
go
on
how
did
you
get
to
that
where
i
found
you
was
a
hard
journey
he
said
meditatively
was
not
easy
to
get
beyond
the
entanglements
which
surrounded
neuburg
yes
even
across
the
river
but
in
time
i
reached
the
woods
and
was
safe
for
i
did
not
think
any
german
could
equal
me
in
wild
country
the
best
of
them
even
their
foresters
are
but
babes
in
veldcraft
compared
with
such
as
me
my
troubles
came
only
from
hunger
and
cold
then
i
met
a
peruvian
smouse
and
sold
him
my
clothes
and
bought
from
him
these
i
did
not
want
to
part
with
my
own
which
were
better
but
he
gave
me
ten
marks
on
the
deal
after
that
i
went
into
a
village
and
ate
heavily
peter
meant
a
fellow
you
pursued
i
asked
do
not
think
so
they
had
gone
north
as
i
expected
and
were
looking
for
me
at
the
railway
stations
which
my
friends
had
marked
for
me
i
walked
happily
and
put
a
bold
face
on
it
if
i
saw
a
man
or
woman
look
at
me
suspiciously
i
went
up
to
them
at
once
and
talked
i
told
a
sad
tale
and
all
believed
it
i
was
a
poor
dutchman
travelling
home
on
foot
to
see
a
dying
mother
and
i
had
been
told
that
by
the
danube
i
should
find
the
main
railway
to
take
me
to
holland
there
were
kind
people
who
gave
me
food
and
one
woman
gave
me
half
a
mark
and
wished
me
god
speed
then
on
the
last
day
of
the
year
i
came
to
the
river
and
found
many
drunkards
that
when
you
resolved
to
get
on
one
of
the
cornelis
as
soon
as
i
heard
of
the
boats
i
saw
where
my
chance
lay
but
you
might
have
knocked
me
over
with
a
straw
when
i
saw
you
come
on
shore
that
was
good
fortune
my
friend
i
have
been
thinking
much
about
the
germans
and
i
will
tell
you
the
truth
it
is
only
boldness
that
can
baffle
them
they
are
a
most
diligent
people
they
will
think
of
all
likely
difficulties
but
not
of
all
possible
ones
they
have
not
much
imagination
they
are
like
steam
engines
which
must
keep
to
prepared
tracks
there
they
will
hunt
any
man
down
but
let
him
trek
for
open
country
and
they
will
be
at
a
loss
therefore
boldness
my
friend
for
ever
boldness
remember
as
a
nation
they
wear
spectacles
which
means
that
they
are
always
peering
peter
broke
off
to
gloat
over
the
wedges
of
geese
and
the
strings
of
wild
swans
that
were
always
winging
across
those
plains
his
tale
had
bucked
me
up
wonderfully
our
luck
had
held
beyond
all
belief
and
i
had
a
kind
of
hope
in
the
business
now
which
had
been
wanting
before
that
afternoon
too
i
got
another
fillip
i
came
on
deck
for
a
breath
of
air
and
found
it
pretty
cold
after
the
heat
of
the
so
i
called
to
one
of
the
deck
hands
to
fetch
me
up
my
cloak
from
the
cabin
the
same
i
had
bought
that
first
morning
in
the
greif
village
grune
the
man
shouted
up
and
i
cried
but
the
words
seemed
to
echo
in
my
ears
and
long
after
he
had
given
me
the
garment
i
stood
staring
abstractedly
over
the
bulwarks
his
tone
had
awakened
a
chord
of
memory
or
to
be
accurate
they
had
given
emphasis
to
what
before
had
been
only
blurred
and
vague
for
he
had
spoken
the
words
which
stumm
had
uttered
behind
his
hand
to
gaudian
i
had
heard
something
like
and
could
make
nothing
of
it
now
i
was
as
certain
of
those
words
as
of
my
own
existence
they
had
been
whatever
it
might
be
was
the
name
which
stumm
had
not
meant
me
to
hear
which
was
some
talisman
for
the
task
i
had
proposed
and
which
was
connected
in
some
way
with
the
mysterious
von
einem
this
discovery
put
me
in
high
fettle
i
told
myself
that
considering
the
difficulties
i
had
managed
to
find
out
a
wonderful
amount
in
a
very
few
days
it
only
shows
what
a
man
can
do
with
the
slenderest
evidence
if
he
keeps
chewing
and
chewing
on
it
two
mornings
later
we
lay
alongside
the
quays
at
belgrade
and
i
took
the
opportunity
of
stretching
my
legs
peter
had
come
ashore
for
a
smoke
and
we
wandered
among
the
battered
riverside
streets
and
looked
at
the
broken
arches
of
the
great
railway
bridge
which
the
germans
were
working
at
like
beavers
there
was
a
big
temporary
pontoon
affair
to
take
the
railway
across
but
i
calculated
that
the
main
bridge
would
be
ready
inside
a
month
it
was
a
clear
cold
blue
day
and
as
one
looked
south
one
saw
ridge
after
ridge
of
snowy
hills
the
upper
streets
of
the
city
were
still
fairly
whole
and
there
were
shops
open
where
food
could
be
got
i
remember
hearing
english
spoken
and
seeing
some
red
cross
nurses
in
the
custody
of
austrian
soldiers
coming
from
the
railway
station
it
would
have
done
me
a
lot
of
good
to
have
had
a
word
with
them
i
thought
of
the
gallant
people
whose
capital
this
had
been
how
three
times
they
had
flung
the
austrians
back
over
the
danube
and
then
had
only
been
beaten
by
the
black
treachery
of
their
allies
somehow
that
morning
in
belgrade
gave
both
peter
and
me
a
new
purpose
in
our
task
it
was
our
business
to
put
a
spoke
in
the
wheel
of
this
monstrous
bloody
juggernaut
that
was
crushing
the
life
out
of
the
little
heroic
nations
we
were
just
getting
ready
to
cast
off
when
a
distinguished
party
arrived
at
the
quay
there
were
all
kinds
of
uniforms
german
austrian
and
bulgarian
and
amid
them
one
stout
gentleman
in
a
fur
coat
and
a
black
felt
hat
they
watched
the
barges
and
before
we
began
to
jerk
into
line
i
could
hear
their
conversation
the
fur
coat
was
talking
english
reckon
that
pretty
good
noos
general
it
said
the
english
have
run
away
from
we
can
use
these
noo
consignments
for
the
bigger
game
i
guess
it
wo
be
long
before
we
see
the
british
lion
moving
out
of
egypt
with
sore
paws
they
all
laughed
privilege
of
that
spectacle
may
soon
be
ours
was
the
reply
i
did
not
pay
much
attention
to
the
talk
indeed
i
did
not
realize
till
weeks
later
that
that
was
the
first
tidings
of
the
great
evacuation
of
cape
helles
what
rejoiced
me
was
the
sight
of
blenkiron
as
bland
as
a
barber
among
those
swells
here
were
two
of
the
missionaries
within
reasonable
distance
of
their
goal
chapter
ten
the
of
suliman
the
red
we
reached
rustchuk
on
january
but
by
no
means
landed
on
that
day
something
had
gone
wrong
with
the
unloading
arrangements
or
more
likely
with
the
railway
behind
them
and
we
were
kept
swinging
all
day
well
out
in
the
turbid
river
on
the
top
of
this
captain
schenk
got
an
ague
and
by
that
evening
was
a
blue
and
shivering
wreck
he
had
done
me
well
and
i
reckoned
i
would
stand
by
him
so
i
got
his
papers
and
the
manifests
of
cargo
and
undertook
to
see
to
the
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
tackled
that
kind
of
business
and
i
had
much
to
learn
about
steam
cranes
i
told
him
i
was
going
on
to
constantinople
and
would
take
peter
with
me
and
he
was
agreeable
he
would
have
to
wait
at
rustchuk
to
get
his
return
cargo
and
could
easily
inspan
a
fresh
engineer
i
worked
about
the
hardest
hours
of
my
life
getting
the
stuff
ashore
the
landing
officer
was
a
bulgarian
quite
a
competent
man
if
he
could
have
made
the
railways
give
him
the
trucks
he
needed
there
was
a
collection
of
hungry
german
transport
officers
always
putting
in
their
oars
and
being
infernally
insolent
to
everybody
i
took
the
high
and
mighty
line
with
them
and
as
i
had
the
bulgarian
commandant
on
my
side
after
about
two
hours
blasphemy
got
them
quieted
but
the
big
trouble
came
the
next
morning
when
i
had
got
nearly
all
the
stuff
aboard
the
trucks
a
young
officer
in
what
i
took
to
be
a
turkish
uniform
rode
up
with
an
i
noticed
the
german
guards
saluting
him
so
i
judged
he
was
rather
a
swell
he
came
up
to
me
and
asked
me
very
civilly
in
german
for
the
i
gave
him
them
and
he
looked
carefully
through
them
marking
certain
items
with
a
blue
pencil
then
he
coolly
handed
them
to
his
and
spoke
to
him
in
turkish
here
i
want
these
back
i
said
ca
do
without
them
and
we
no
time
to
waste
he
said
smiling
and
went
off
i
said
nothing
reflecting
that
the
stuff
was
for
the
turks
and
they
naturally
had
to
have
some
say
in
its
handling
the
loading
was
practically
finished
when
my
gentleman
returned
he
handed
me
a
neatly
typed
new
set
of
one
glance
at
them
showed
that
some
of
the
big
items
had
been
left
out
this
wo
do
i
cried
me
back
the
right
set
this
thing
no
good
to
me
for
answer
he
winked
gently
smiled
like
a
dusky
seraph
and
held
out
his
hand
in
it
i
saw
a
roll
of
money
yourself
he
said
is
the
usual
custom
it
was
the
first
time
anyone
had
ever
tried
to
bribe
me
and
it
made
me
boil
up
like
a
geyser
i
saw
his
game
clearly
enough
turkey
would
pay
for
the
lot
to
germany
probably
had
already
paid
the
bill
but
she
would
pay
double
for
the
things
not
on
the
and
pay
to
this
fellow
and
his
friends
this
struck
me
as
rather
steep
even
for
oriental
methods
of
doing
business
look
here
sir
i
said
do
stir
from
this
place
till
i
get
the
correct
if
you
wo
give
me
them
i
will
have
every
item
out
of
the
trucks
and
make
a
new
list
but
a
correct
list
i
have
or
the
stuff
stays
here
till
doomsday
he
was
a
slim
foppish
fellow
and
he
looked
more
puzzled
than
angry
offer
you
enough
he
said
again
stretching
out
his
hand
at
that
i
fairly
roared
you
try
to
bribe
me
you
infernal
little
haberdasher
i
have
you
off
that
horse
and
chuck
you
in
the
river
he
no
longer
misunderstood
me
he
began
to
curse
and
threaten
but
i
cut
him
short
along
to
the
commandant
my
boy
i
said
and
i
marched
away
tearing
up
his
typewritten
sheets
as
i
went
and
strewing
them
behind
me
like
a
paper
chase
we
had
a
fine
old
racket
in
the
commandant
office
i
said
it
was
my
business
as
representing
the
german
government
to
see
the
stuff
delivered
to
the
consignee
at
constantinople
and
i
told
him
it
was
my
habit
to
proceed
with
cooked
documents
he
could
but
agree
with
me
but
there
was
that
wrathful
oriental
with
his
face
as
fixed
as
a
buddha
am
sorry
rasta
bey
he
said
this
man
is
in
the
right
have
authority
from
the
committee
to
receive
the
stores
he
said
sullenly
are
not
my
instructions
was
the
answer
are
consigned
to
the
artillery
commandant
at
chataldja
general
von
oesterzee
the
man
shrugged
his
shoulders
well
i
will
have
a
word
to
say
to
general
von
oesterzee
and
many
to
this
fellow
who
flouts
the
committee
and
he
strode
away
like
an
impudent
boy
the
harassed
commandant
grinned
offended
his
lordship
and
he
is
a
bad
enemy
all
those
damned
comitadjis
are
you
would
be
well
advised
not
to
go
on
to
constantinople
have
that
blighter
in
the
red
hat
loot
the
trucks
on
the
road
no
thank
you
i
am
going
to
see
them
safe
at
chataldja
or
whatever
they
call
the
artillery
depot
i
said
a
good
deal
more
but
that
is
an
abbreviated
translation
of
my
remarks
my
word
for
was
but
i
used
some
other
expressions
which
would
have
ravished
my
young
turk
friend
to
hear
looking
back
it
seems
pretty
ridiculous
to
have
made
all
this
fuss
about
guns
which
were
going
to
be
used
against
my
own
people
but
i
did
see
that
at
the
time
my
professional
pride
was
up
in
arms
and
i
could
bear
to
have
a
hand
in
a
crooked
deal
i
advise
you
to
go
armed
said
the
commandant
will
have
a
guard
for
the
trucks
of
course
and
i
will
pick
you
good
men
they
may
hold
you
up
all
the
same
i
ca
help
you
once
you
are
past
the
frontier
but
i
send
a
wire
to
oesterzee
and
he
make
trouble
if
anything
goes
wrong
i
still
think
you
would
have
been
wiser
to
humour
rasta
bey
as
i
was
leaving
he
gave
me
a
telegram
a
wire
for
your
captain
schenk
i
slipped
the
envelope
in
my
pocket
and
went
out
schenk
was
pretty
sick
so
i
left
a
note
for
him
at
one
i
got
the
train
started
with
a
couple
of
german
landwehr
in
each
truck
and
peter
and
i
in
a
presently
i
remembered
schenk
telegram
which
still
reposed
in
my
pocket
i
took
it
out
and
opened
it
meaning
to
wire
it
from
the
first
station
we
stopped
at
but
i
changed
my
mind
when
i
read
it
it
was
from
some
official
at
regensburg
asking
him
to
put
under
arrest
and
send
back
by
the
first
boat
a
man
called
brandt
who
was
believed
to
have
come
aboard
at
absthafen
on
the
of
december
i
whistled
and
showed
it
to
peter
the
sooner
we
were
at
constantinople
the
better
and
i
prayed
we
would
get
there
before
the
fellow
who
sent
this
wire
repeated
it
and
got
the
commandant
to
send
on
the
message
and
have
us
held
up
at
chataldja
for
my
back
had
fairly
got
stiffened
about
these
munitions
and
i
was
going
to
take
any
risk
to
see
them
safely
delivered
to
their
proper
owner
peter
understand
me
at
all
he
still
hankered
after
a
grand
destruction
of
the
lot
somewhere
down
the
railway
but
then
this
was
the
line
of
peter
profession
and
his
pride
was
not
at
stake
we
had
a
mortally
slow
journey
it
was
bad
enough
in
bulgaria
but
when
we
crossed
the
frontier
at
a
place
called
mustafa
pasha
we
struck
the
real
supineness
of
the
east
happily
i
found
a
german
officer
there
who
had
some
notion
of
hustling
and
after
all
it
was
his
interest
to
get
the
stuff
moved
it
was
the
morning
of
the
after
peter
and
i
had
been
living
like
pigs
on
black
bread
and
condemned
tin
stuff
that
we
came
in
sight
of
a
blue
sea
on
our
right
hand
and
knew
we
could
be
very
far
from
the
end
it
was
jolly
near
the
end
in
another
sense
we
stopped
at
a
station
and
were
stretching
our
legs
on
the
platform
when
i
saw
a
familiar
figure
approaching
it
was
rasta
with
half
a
dozen
turkish
gendarmes
i
called
peter
and
we
clambered
into
the
truck
next
our
i
had
been
half
expecting
some
move
like
this
and
had
made
a
plan
the
turk
swaggered
up
and
addressed
us
can
get
back
to
rustchuk
he
said
take
over
from
you
here
hand
me
the
papers
this
chataldja
i
asked
innocently
is
the
end
of
your
affair
he
said
haughtily
or
it
will
be
the
worse
for
you
look
here
my
son
i
said
a
kid
and
know
nothing
i
hand
over
to
general
von
oesterzee
and
to
no
one
else
are
in
turkey
he
cried
will
obey
the
turkish
government
obey
the
government
right
enough
i
said
if
you
the
government
i
could
make
a
better
one
with
a
bib
and
a
rattle
he
said
something
to
his
men
who
unslung
their
rifles
do
begin
shooting
i
said
are
twelve
armed
guards
in
this
train
who
will
take
their
orders
from
me
besides
i
and
my
friend
can
shoot
a
bit
he
cried
getting
very
angry
can
order
up
a
regiment
in
five
minutes
you
can
i
said
observe
the
situation
i
am
sitting
on
enough
toluol
to
blow
up
this
countryside
if
you
dare
to
come
aboard
i
will
shoot
you
if
you
call
in
your
regiment
i
will
tell
you
what
i
do
i
fire
this
stuff
and
i
reckon
they
be
picking
up
the
bits
of
you
and
your
regiment
off
the
gallipoli
peninsula
he
had
put
up
a
bluff
a
poor
one
and
i
had
called
it
he
saw
i
meant
what
i
said
and
became
silken
sir
he
said
have
had
a
fair
chance
and
rejected
it
we
shall
meet
again
soon
and
you
will
be
sorry
for
your
insolence
he
strutted
away
and
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
keep
from
running
after
him
i
wanted
to
lay
him
over
my
knee
and
spank
him
we
got
safely
to
chataldja
and
were
received
by
von
oesterzee
like
brothers
he
was
the
regular
not
thinking
about
anything
except
his
guns
and
shells
i
had
to
wait
about
three
hours
while
he
was
checking
the
stuff
with
the
invoices
and
then
he
gave
me
a
receipt
which
i
still
possess
i
told
him
about
rasta
and
he
agreed
that
i
had
done
right
it
did
make
him
as
mad
as
i
expected
because
you
see
he
got
his
stuff
safe
in
any
case
it
was
only
that
the
wretched
turks
had
to
pay
twice
for
the
lot
of
it
he
gave
peter
and
me
luncheon
and
was
altogether
very
civil
and
inclined
to
talk
about
the
war
i
would
have
liked
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
for
it
would
have
been
something
to
get
the
inside
view
of
germany
eastern
campaign
but
i
did
not
dare
to
wait
any
moment
there
might
arrive
an
incriminating
wire
from
rustchuk
finally
he
lent
us
a
car
to
take
us
the
few
miles
to
the
city
so
it
came
about
that
at
five
past
three
on
the
day
of
january
with
only
the
clothes
we
stood
up
in
peter
and
i
entered
constantinople
i
was
in
considerable
spirits
for
i
had
got
the
final
lap
successfully
over
and
i
was
looking
forward
madly
to
meeting
my
friends
but
all
the
same
the
first
sight
was
a
mighty
disappointment
i
do
quite
know
what
i
had
expected
a
sort
of
fairyland
eastern
city
all
white
marble
and
blue
water
and
stately
turks
in
surplices
and
veiled
houris
and
roses
and
nightingales
and
some
sort
of
string
band
discoursing
sweet
music
i
had
forgotten
that
winter
is
pretty
much
the
same
everywhere
it
was
a
drizzling
day
with
a
wind
blowing
and
the
streets
were
long
troughs
of
mud
the
first
part
i
struck
looked
like
a
dingy
colonial
suburb
wooden
houses
and
corrugated
iron
roofs
and
endless
dirty
sallow
children
there
was
a
cemetery
i
remember
with
turks
caps
stuck
at
the
head
of
each
grave
then
we
got
into
narrow
steep
streets
which
descended
to
a
kind
of
big
canal
i
saw
what
i
took
to
be
mosques
and
minarets
and
they
were
about
as
impressive
as
factory
chimneys
by
and
by
we
crossed
a
bridge
and
paid
a
penny
for
the
privilege
if
i
had
known
it
was
the
famous
golden
horn
i
would
have
looked
at
it
with
more
interest
but
i
saw
nothing
save
a
lot
of
barges
and
some
queer
little
boats
like
gondolas
then
we
came
into
busier
streets
where
ramshackle
cabs
drawn
by
lean
horses
spluttered
through
the
mud
i
saw
one
old
fellow
who
looked
like
my
notion
of
a
turk
but
most
of
the
population
had
the
appearance
of
london
men
all
but
the
soldiers
turk
and
german
who
seemed
fellows
peter
had
paddled
along
at
my
side
like
a
faithful
dog
not
saying
a
word
but
clearly
not
approving
of
this
wet
and
dirty
metropolis
you
know
that
we
are
being
followed
cornelis
he
said
suddenly
since
we
came
into
this
dorp
peter
was
infallible
in
a
thing
like
that
the
news
scared
me
badly
for
i
feared
that
the
telegram
had
come
to
chataldja
then
i
thought
it
could
be
that
for
if
von
oesterzee
had
wanted
me
he
have
taken
the
trouble
to
stalk
me
it
was
more
likely
my
friend
rasta
i
found
the
ferry
of
ratchik
by
asking
a
soldier
and
a
german
sailor
there
told
me
where
the
kurdish
bazaar
was
he
pointed
up
a
steep
street
which
ran
past
a
high
block
of
warehouses
with
every
window
broken
sandy
had
said
the
side
coming
down
so
it
must
be
the
side
going
up
we
plunged
into
it
and
it
was
the
filthiest
place
of
all
the
wind
whistled
up
it
and
stirred
the
garbage
it
seemed
densely
inhabited
for
at
all
the
doors
there
were
groups
of
people
squatting
with
their
heads
covered
though
scarcely
a
window
showed
in
the
blank
walls
the
street
corkscrewed
endlessly
sometimes
it
seemed
to
stop
then
it
found
a
hole
in
the
opposing
masonry
and
edged
its
way
in
often
it
was
almost
pitch
dark
then
would
come
a
greyish
twilight
where
it
opened
out
to
the
width
of
a
decent
lane
to
find
a
house
in
that
murk
was
no
easy
job
and
by
the
time
we
had
gone
a
quarter
of
a
mile
i
began
to
fear
we
had
missed
it
it
was
no
good
asking
any
of
the
crowd
we
met
they
did
look
as
if
they
understood
any
civilized
tongue
at
last
we
stumbled
on
it
a
coffee
house
with
kuprasso
above
the
door
in
queer
amateur
lettering
there
was
a
lamp
burning
inside
and
two
or
three
men
smoking
at
small
wooden
tables
we
ordered
coffee
thick
black
stuff
like
treacle
which
peter
anathematized
a
negro
brought
it
and
i
told
him
in
german
i
wanted
to
speak
to
mr
kuprasso
he
paid
no
attention
so
i
shouted
louder
at
him
and
the
noise
brought
a
man
out
of
the
back
parts
he
was
a
fat
oldish
fellow
with
a
long
nose
very
like
the
greek
traders
you
see
on
the
zanzibar
coast
i
beckoned
to
him
and
he
waddled
forward
smiling
oilily
then
i
asked
him
what
he
would
take
and
he
replied
in
very
halting
german
that
he
would
have
a
sirop
are
mr
kuprasso
i
said
wanted
to
show
this
place
to
my
friend
he
has
heard
of
your
and
the
fun
there
signor
is
mistaken
i
have
no
i
said
been
here
before
my
boy
i
recall
your
shanty
at
the
back
and
many
merry
nights
there
what
was
it
you
called
it
oh
i
remember
the
of
suliman
the
red
he
put
his
finger
to
his
lip
and
looked
incredibly
sly
signor
remembers
that
but
that
was
in
the
old
happy
days
before
war
came
the
place
is
long
since
shut
the
people
here
are
too
poor
to
dance
and
sing
the
same
i
would
like
to
have
another
look
at
it
i
said
and
i
slipped
an
english
sovereign
into
his
hand
he
glanced
at
it
in
surprise
and
his
manner
changed
signor
is
a
prince
and
i
will
do
his
will
he
clapped
his
hands
and
the
negro
appeared
and
at
his
nod
took
his
place
behind
a
little
me
he
said
and
led
us
through
a
long
noisome
passage
which
was
pitch
dark
and
very
unevenly
paved
then
he
unlocked
a
door
and
with
a
swirl
the
wind
caught
it
and
blew
it
back
on
us
we
were
looking
into
a
mean
little
yard
with
on
one
side
a
high
curving
wall
evidently
of
great
age
with
bushes
growing
in
the
cracks
of
it
some
scraggy
myrtles
stood
in
broken
pots
and
nettles
flourished
in
a
corner
at
one
end
was
a
wooden
building
like
a
dissenting
chapel
but
painted
a
dingy
scarlet
its
windows
and
skylights
were
black
with
dirt
and
its
door
tied
up
with
rope
flapped
in
the
wind
the
pavilion
kuprasso
said
proudly
is
the
old
place
i
observed
with
feeling
times
seen
there
tell
me
mr
kuprasso
do
you
ever
open
it
now
he
put
his
thick
lips
to
my
ear
the
signor
will
be
silent
i
will
tell
him
it
is
sometimes
open
not
often
men
must
amuse
themselves
even
in
war
some
of
the
german
officers
come
here
for
their
pleasure
and
but
last
week
we
had
the
ballet
of
mademoiselle
cici
the
police
approve
but
not
often
for
this
is
no
time
for
too
much
gaiety
i
will
tell
you
a
secret
tomorrow
afternoon
there
will
be
dancing
wonderful
dancing
only
a
few
of
my
patrons
know
who
think
you
will
be
here
he
bent
his
head
closer
and
said
in
a
whisper
compagnie
des
heures
roses
indeed
i
said
with
a
proper
tone
of
respect
though
i
had
a
notion
what
he
meant
the
signor
wish
to
come
i
said
of
us
we
all
for
the
rosy
hours
the
fourth
hour
after
midday
walk
straight
through
the
cafe
and
one
will
be
there
to
unlock
the
door
you
are
here
take
the
advice
of
angelo
kuprasso
and
avoid
the
streets
after
nightfall
stamboul
is
no
safe
place
nowadays
for
quiet
men
i
asked
him
to
name
a
hotel
and
he
rattled
off
a
list
from
which
i
chose
one
that
sounded
modest
and
in
keeping
with
our
it
was
not
far
off
only
a
hundred
yards
to
the
right
at
the
top
of
the
hill
when
we
left
his
door
the
night
had
begun
to
drop
we
had
gone
twenty
yards
before
peter
drew
very
near
to
me
and
kept
turning
his
head
like
a
hunted
stag
are
being
followed
close
cornelis
he
said
calmly
another
ten
yards
and
we
were
at
a
where
a
little
faced
a
biggish
mosque
i
could
see
in
the
waning
light
a
crowd
of
people
who
seemed
to
be
moving
towards
us
i
heard
a
voice
cry
out
a
jabber
of
excited
words
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
heard
the
voice
before
chapter
eleven
the
companions
of
the
rosy
hours
we
battled
to
a
corner
where
a
jut
of
building
stood
out
into
the
street
it
was
our
only
chance
to
protect
our
backs
to
stand
up
with
the
rib
of
stone
between
us
it
was
only
the
work
of
seconds
one
instant
we
were
groping
our
solitary
way
in
the
darkness
the
next
we
were
pinned
against
a
wall
with
a
throaty
mob
surging
round
us
it
took
me
a
moment
or
two
to
realize
that
we
were
attacked
every
man
has
one
special
funk
in
the
back
of
his
head
and
mine
was
to
be
the
quarry
of
an
angry
crowd
i
hated
the
thought
of
it
the
mess
the
blind
struggle
the
sense
of
unleashed
passions
different
from
those
of
any
single
blackguard
it
was
a
dark
world
to
me
and
i
do
like
darkness
but
in
my
nightmares
i
had
never
imagined
anything
just
like
this
the
narrow
fetid
street
with
the
icy
winds
fanning
the
filth
the
unknown
tongue
the
hoarse
savage
murmur
and
my
utter
ignorance
as
to
what
it
might
all
be
about
made
me
cold
in
the
pit
of
my
stomach
got
it
in
the
neck
this
time
old
man
i
said
to
peter
who
had
out
the
pistol
the
commandant
at
rustchuk
had
given
him
these
pistols
were
our
only
weapons
the
crowd
saw
them
and
hung
back
but
if
they
chose
to
rush
us
it
was
much
of
a
barrier
two
pistols
would
make
rasta
voice
had
stopped
he
had
done
his
work
and
had
retired
to
the
background
there
were
shouts
from
the
crowd
and
a
word
constantly
repeated
i
did
know
what
it
meant
at
the
time
but
now
i
know
that
they
were
after
us
because
we
were
boches
and
spies
there
was
no
love
lost
between
the
constantinople
scum
and
their
new
masters
it
seemed
an
ironical
end
for
peter
and
me
to
be
done
in
because
we
were
boches
and
done
in
we
should
be
i
had
heard
of
the
east
as
a
good
place
for
people
to
disappear
in
there
were
no
inquisitive
newspapers
or
incorruptible
police
i
wished
to
heaven
i
had
a
word
of
turkish
but
i
made
my
voice
heard
for
a
second
in
a
pause
of
the
din
and
shouted
that
we
were
german
sailors
who
had
brought
down
big
guns
for
turkey
and
were
going
home
next
day
i
asked
them
what
the
devil
they
thought
we
had
done
i
do
know
if
any
fellow
there
understood
german
anyhow
it
only
brought
a
pandemonium
of
cries
in
which
that
ominous
word
was
predominant
then
peter
fired
over
their
heads
he
had
to
for
a
chap
was
pawing
at
his
throat
the
answer
was
a
clatter
of
bullets
on
the
wall
above
us
it
looked
as
if
they
meant
to
take
us
alive
and
that
i
was
very
clear
should
not
happen
better
a
bloody
end
in
a
street
scrap
than
the
tender
mercies
of
that
bandbox
bravo
i
do
quite
know
what
happened
next
a
press
drove
down
at
me
and
i
fired
someone
squealed
and
i
looked
the
next
moment
to
be
strangled
and
then
suddenly
the
scrimmage
ceased
and
there
was
a
wavering
splash
of
light
in
that
pit
of
darkness
i
never
went
through
many
worse
minutes
than
these
when
i
had
been
hunted
in
the
past
weeks
there
had
been
mystery
enough
but
no
immediate
peril
to
face
when
i
had
been
up
against
a
real
urgent
physical
risk
like
loos
the
danger
at
any
rate
had
been
clear
one
knew
what
one
was
in
for
but
here
was
a
threat
i
could
put
a
name
to
and
it
was
in
the
future
but
pressing
hard
at
our
throats
and
yet
i
could
feel
it
was
quite
real
the
patter
of
the
pistol
bullets
against
the
wall
like
so
many
crackers
the
faces
felt
rather
than
seen
in
the
dark
the
clamour
which
to
me
was
pure
gibberish
had
all
the
madness
of
a
nightmare
only
peter
cursing
steadily
in
dutch
by
my
side
was
real
and
then
the
light
came
and
made
the
scene
more
eerie
it
came
from
one
or
two
torches
carried
by
wild
fellows
with
long
staves
who
drove
their
way
into
the
heart
of
the
mob
the
flickering
glare
ran
up
the
steep
walls
and
made
monstrous
shadows
the
wind
swung
the
flame
into
long
streamers
dying
away
in
a
fan
of
sparks
and
now
a
new
word
was
heard
in
the
crowd
it
was
shouted
not
in
anger
but
in
fear
at
first
i
could
not
see
the
newcomers
they
were
hidden
in
the
deep
darkness
under
their
canopy
of
light
for
they
were
holding
their
torches
high
at
the
full
stretch
of
their
arms
they
were
shouting
too
wild
shrill
cries
ending
sometimes
in
a
gush
of
rapid
speech
their
words
did
not
seem
to
be
directed
against
us
but
against
the
crowd
a
sudden
hope
came
to
me
that
for
some
unknown
reason
they
were
on
our
side
the
press
was
no
longer
heavy
against
us
it
was
thinning
rapidly
and
i
could
hear
the
scuffle
as
men
made
off
down
the
side
streets
my
first
notion
was
that
these
were
the
turkish
police
but
i
changed
my
mind
when
the
leader
came
out
into
a
patch
of
light
he
carried
no
torch
but
a
long
stave
with
which
he
belaboured
the
heads
of
those
who
were
too
tightly
packed
to
flee
it
was
the
most
eldritch
apparition
you
can
conceive
a
tall
man
dressed
in
skins
with
bare
legs
and
feet
a
wisp
of
scarlet
cloth
clung
to
his
shoulders
and
drawn
over
his
head
down
close
to
his
eyes
was
a
of
some
kind
of
pelt
with
the
tail
waving
behind
it
he
capered
like
a
wild
animal
keeping
up
a
strange
high
monotone
that
fairly
gave
me
the
creeps
i
was
suddenly
aware
that
the
crowd
had
gone
before
us
was
only
this
figure
and
his
companions
some
carrying
torches
and
all
wearing
clothes
of
skin
but
only
the
one
who
seemed
to
be
their
leader
wore
the
the
rest
had
bare
heads
and
long
tangled
hair
the
fellow
was
shouting
gibberish
at
me
his
eyes
were
glassy
like
a
man
who
smokes
hemp
and
his
legs
were
never
still
for
a
second
you
would
think
such
a
figure
no
better
than
a
mountebank
and
yet
there
was
nothing
comic
in
it
fearful
and
sinister
and
uncanny
it
was
and
i
wanted
to
do
anything
but
laugh
as
he
shouted
he
kept
pointing
with
his
stave
up
the
street
which
climbed
the
hillside
means
us
to
move
said
peter
god
sake
let
us
get
away
from
this
i
could
make
sense
of
it
but
one
thing
was
clear
these
maniacs
had
delivered
us
for
the
moment
from
rasta
and
his
friends
then
i
did
a
dashed
silly
thing
i
pulled
out
a
sovereign
and
offered
it
to
the
leader
i
had
some
kind
of
notion
of
showing
gratitude
and
as
i
had
no
words
i
had
to
show
it
by
deed
he
brought
his
stick
down
on
my
wrist
and
sent
the
coin
spinning
in
the
gutter
his
eyes
blazed
and
he
made
his
weapon
sing
round
my
head
he
cursed
me
oh
i
could
tell
cursing
well
enough
though
i
follow
a
word
and
he
cried
to
his
followers
and
they
cursed
me
too
i
had
offered
him
a
mortal
insult
and
stirred
up
a
worse
hornet
nest
than
rasta
push
peter
and
i
with
a
common
impulse
took
to
our
heels
we
were
not
looking
for
any
trouble
with
demoniacs
up
the
steep
narrow
lane
we
ran
with
that
bedlamite
crowd
at
our
heels
the
torches
seemed
to
have
gone
out
for
the
place
was
black
as
pitch
and
we
tumbled
over
heaps
of
offal
and
splashed
through
running
drains
the
men
were
close
behind
us
and
more
than
once
i
felt
a
stick
on
my
shoulder
but
fear
lent
us
wings
and
suddenly
before
us
was
a
blaze
of
light
and
we
saw
the
debouchment
of
our
street
in
a
main
thoroughfare
the
others
saw
it
too
for
they
slackened
off
just
before
we
reached
the
light
we
stopped
and
looked
round
there
was
no
sound
or
sight
behind
us
in
the
dark
lane
which
dipped
to
the
harbour
is
a
queer
country
cornelis
said
peter
feeling
his
limbs
for
bruises
many
things
happen
in
too
short
a
time
i
am
breathless
the
big
street
we
had
struck
seemed
to
run
along
the
crest
of
the
hill
there
were
lamps
in
it
and
crawling
cabs
and
quite
shops
we
soon
found
the
hotel
to
which
kuprasso
had
directed
us
a
big
place
in
a
courtyard
with
a
very
portico
and
green
which
rattled
drearily
in
the
winter
wind
it
proved
as
i
had
feared
to
be
packed
to
the
door
mostly
with
german
officers
with
some
trouble
i
got
an
interview
with
the
proprietor
the
usual
greek
and
told
him
that
we
had
been
sent
there
by
mr
kuprasso
that
did
affect
him
in
the
least
and
we
would
have
been
shot
into
the
street
if
i
had
remembered
about
stumm
pass
so
i
explained
that
we
had
come
from
germany
with
munitions
and
only
wanted
rooms
for
one
night
i
showed
him
the
pass
and
blustered
a
good
deal
till
he
became
civil
and
said
he
would
do
the
best
he
could
for
us
that
best
was
pretty
poor
peter
and
i
were
doubled
up
in
a
small
room
which
contained
two
and
little
else
and
had
broken
windows
through
which
the
wind
whistled
we
had
a
wretched
dinner
of
stringy
mutton
boiled
with
vegetables
and
a
white
cheese
strong
enough
to
raise
the
dead
but
i
got
a
bottle
of
whisky
for
which
i
paid
a
sovereign
and
we
managed
to
light
the
stove
in
our
room
fasten
the
shutters
and
warm
our
hearts
with
a
brew
of
toddy
after
that
we
went
to
bed
and
slept
like
logs
for
twelve
hours
on
the
road
from
rustchuk
we
had
had
uneasy
slumbers
i
woke
next
morning
and
looking
out
from
the
broken
window
saw
that
it
was
snowing
with
a
lot
of
trouble
i
got
hold
of
a
servant
and
made
him
bring
us
some
of
the
treacly
turkish
coffee
we
were
both
in
pretty
low
spirits
is
a
poor
cold
place
said
peter
worth
fighting
for
there
is
only
one
white
man
land
and
that
is
south
africa
at
the
time
i
heartily
agreed
with
him
i
remember
that
sitting
on
the
edge
of
my
bed
i
took
stock
of
our
position
it
was
not
very
cheering
we
seemed
to
have
been
amassing
enemies
at
a
furious
pace
first
of
all
there
was
rasta
whom
i
had
insulted
and
who
would
forget
it
in
a
hurry
he
had
his
crowd
of
turkish
and
was
bound
to
get
us
sooner
or
later
then
there
was
the
maniac
in
the
skin
hat
he
did
like
rasta
and
i
made
a
guess
that
he
and
his
weird
friends
were
of
some
party
hostile
to
the
young
turks
but
on
the
other
hand
he
did
like
us
and
there
would
be
bad
trouble
the
next
time
we
met
him
finally
there
was
stumm
and
the
german
government
it
could
only
be
a
matter
of
hours
at
the
best
before
he
got
the
rustchuk
authorities
on
our
trail
it
would
be
easy
to
trace
us
from
chataldja
and
once
they
had
us
we
were
absolutely
done
there
was
a
big
black
against
us
which
by
no
conceivable
piece
of
luck
could
be
upset
it
was
very
clear
to
me
that
unless
we
could
find
sanctuary
and
shed
all
our
various
pursuers
during
this
day
we
should
be
done
in
for
good
and
all
but
where
on
earth
were
we
to
find
sanctuary
we
had
neither
of
us
a
word
of
the
language
and
there
was
no
way
i
could
see
of
taking
on
new
characters
for
that
we
wanted
friends
and
help
and
i
could
think
of
none
anywhere
somewhere
to
be
sure
there
was
blenkiron
but
how
could
we
get
in
touch
with
him
as
for
sandy
i
had
pretty
well
given
him
up
i
always
thought
his
enterprise
the
craziest
of
the
lot
and
bound
to
fail
he
was
probably
somewhere
in
asia
minor
and
a
month
or
two
later
would
get
to
constantinople
and
hear
in
some
the
yarn
of
the
two
wretched
dutchmen
who
had
disappeared
so
soon
from
men
sight
that
rendezvous
at
kuprasso
was
no
good
it
would
have
been
all
right
if
we
had
got
here
unsuspected
and
could
have
gone
on
quietly
frequenting
the
place
till
blenkiron
picked
us
up
but
to
do
that
we
wanted
leisure
and
secrecy
and
here
we
were
with
a
pack
of
hounds
at
our
heels
the
place
was
horribly
dangerous
already
if
we
showed
ourselves
there
we
should
be
gathered
in
by
rasta
or
by
the
german
military
police
or
by
the
madman
in
the
skin
cap
it
was
a
stark
impossibility
to
hang
about
on
the
of
meeting
blenkiron
i
reflected
with
some
bitterness
that
this
was
the
day
of
january
the
day
of
our
assignation
i
had
had
high
hopes
all
the
way
down
the
danube
of
meeting
with
blenkiron
for
i
knew
he
would
be
in
time
of
giving
him
the
information
i
had
had
the
good
fortune
to
collect
of
piecing
it
together
with
what
he
had
found
out
and
of
getting
the
whole
story
which
sir
walter
hungered
for
after
that
i
thought
it
would
be
hard
to
get
away
by
rumania
and
to
get
home
through
russia
i
had
hoped
to
be
back
with
my
battalion
in
february
having
done
as
good
a
bit
of
work
as
anybody
in
the
war
as
it
was
it
looked
as
if
my
information
would
die
with
me
unless
i
could
find
blenkiron
before
the
evening
i
talked
the
thing
over
with
peter
and
he
agreed
that
we
were
fairly
up
against
it
we
decided
to
go
to
kuprasso
that
afternoon
and
to
trust
to
luck
for
the
rest
it
would
do
to
wander
about
the
streets
so
we
sat
tight
in
our
room
all
morning
and
swopped
old
hunting
yarns
to
keep
our
minds
from
the
beastly
present
we
got
some
food
at
midday
cold
mutton
and
the
same
cheese
and
finished
our
whisky
then
i
paid
the
bill
for
i
did
dare
to
stay
there
another
night
about
three
we
went
into
the
street
without
the
foggiest
notion
where
we
would
find
our
next
quarters
it
was
snowing
heavily
which
was
a
piece
of
luck
for
us
poor
old
peter
had
no
greatcoat
so
we
went
into
a
jew
shop
and
bought
a
abomination
which
looked
as
if
it
might
have
been
meant
for
a
dissenting
parson
it
was
no
good
saving
my
money
when
the
future
was
so
black
the
snow
made
the
streets
deserted
and
we
turned
down
the
long
lane
which
led
to
ratchik
ferry
and
found
it
perfectly
quiet
i
do
not
think
we
met
a
soul
till
we
got
to
kuprasso
shop
we
walked
straight
through
the
cafe
which
was
empty
and
down
the
dark
passage
till
we
were
stopped
by
the
garden
door
i
knocked
and
it
swung
open
there
was
the
bleak
yard
now
puddled
with
snow
and
a
blaze
of
light
from
the
pavilion
at
the
other
end
there
was
a
scraping
of
fiddles
too
and
the
sound
of
human
talk
we
paid
the
negro
at
the
door
and
passed
from
the
bitter
afternoon
into
a
garish
saloon
there
were
forty
or
fifty
people
there
drinking
coffee
and
sirops
and
filling
the
air
with
the
fumes
of
latakia
most
of
them
were
turks
in
european
clothes
and
the
fez
but
there
were
some
german
officers
and
what
looked
like
german
civilians
army
service
corps
clerks
probably
and
mechanics
from
the
arsenal
a
woman
in
cheap
finery
was
tinkling
at
the
piano
and
there
were
several
shrill
females
with
the
officers
peter
and
i
sat
down
modestly
in
the
nearest
corner
where
old
kuprasso
saw
us
and
sent
us
coffee
a
girl
who
looked
like
a
jewess
came
over
to
us
and
talked
french
but
i
shook
my
head
and
she
went
off
again
presently
a
girl
came
on
the
stage
and
danced
a
silly
affair
all
a
clashing
of
tambourines
and
wriggling
i
have
seen
native
women
do
the
same
thing
better
in
a
mozambique
kraal
another
sang
a
german
song
a
simple
sentimental
thing
about
golden
hair
and
rainbows
and
the
germans
present
applauded
the
place
was
so
tinselly
and
common
that
coming
to
it
from
weeks
of
rough
travelling
it
made
me
impatient
i
forgot
that
while
for
the
others
it
might
be
a
vulgar
little
for
us
it
was
as
perilous
as
a
brigands
den
peter
did
not
share
my
mood
he
was
quite
interested
in
it
as
he
was
interested
in
everything
new
he
had
a
genius
for
living
in
the
moment
i
remember
there
was
a
on
which
was
daubed
a
blue
lake
with
very
green
hills
in
the
distance
as
the
tobacco
smoke
grew
thicker
and
the
fiddles
went
on
squealing
this
tawdry
picture
began
to
mesmerize
me
i
seemed
to
be
looking
out
of
a
window
at
a
lovely
summer
landscape
where
there
were
no
wars
or
danger
i
seemed
to
feel
the
warm
sun
and
to
smell
the
fragrance
of
blossom
from
the
islands
and
then
i
became
aware
that
a
queer
scent
had
stolen
into
the
atmosphere
there
were
braziers
burning
at
both
ends
to
warm
the
room
and
the
thin
smoke
from
these
smelt
like
incense
somebody
had
been
putting
a
powder
in
the
flames
for
suddenly
the
place
became
very
quiet
the
fiddles
still
sounded
but
far
away
like
an
echo
the
lights
went
down
all
but
a
circle
on
the
stage
and
into
that
circle
stepped
my
enemy
of
the
skin
cap
he
had
three
others
with
him
i
heard
a
whisper
behind
me
and
the
words
were
those
which
kuprasso
had
used
the
day
before
these
bedlamites
were
called
the
companions
of
the
rosy
hours
and
kuprasso
had
promised
great
dancing
i
hoped
to
goodness
they
would
not
see
us
for
they
had
fairly
given
me
the
horrors
peter
felt
the
same
and
we
both
made
ourselves
very
small
in
that
dark
corner
but
the
newcomers
had
no
eyes
for
us
in
a
twinkling
the
pavilion
changed
from
a
common
saloon
which
might
have
been
in
chicago
or
paris
to
a
place
of
mystery
yes
and
of
beauty
it
became
the
of
suliman
the
red
whoever
that
sportsman
may
have
been
sandy
had
said
that
the
ends
of
the
earth
converged
there
and
he
had
been
right
i
lost
all
consciousness
of
my
neighbours
stout
german
turk
frowsy
jewess
and
saw
only
strange
figures
leaping
in
a
circle
of
light
figures
that
came
out
of
the
deepest
darkness
to
make
a
big
magic
the
leader
flung
some
stuff
into
the
brazier
and
a
great
fan
of
blue
light
flared
up
he
was
weaving
circles
and
he
was
singing
something
shrill
and
high
whilst
his
companions
made
a
chorus
with
their
deep
monotone
i
ca
tell
you
what
the
dance
was
i
had
seen
the
russian
ballet
just
before
the
war
and
one
of
the
men
in
it
reminded
me
of
this
man
but
the
dancing
was
the
least
part
of
it
it
was
neither
sound
nor
movement
nor
scent
that
wrought
the
spell
but
something
far
more
potent
in
an
instant
i
found
myself
reft
away
from
the
present
with
its
dull
dangers
and
looking
at
a
world
all
young
and
fresh
and
beautiful
the
gaudy
had
vanished
it
was
a
window
i
was
looking
from
and
i
was
gazing
at
the
finest
landscape
on
earth
lit
by
the
pure
clean
light
of
morning
it
seemed
to
be
part
of
the
veld
but
like
no
veld
i
had
ever
seen
it
was
wider
and
wilder
and
more
gracious
indeed
i
was
looking
at
my
first
youth
i
was
feeling
the
kind
of
immortal
which
only
a
boy
knows
in
the
dawning
of
his
days
i
had
no
longer
any
fear
of
these
they
were
kindly
wizards
who
had
brought
me
into
fairyland
then
slowly
from
the
silence
there
distilled
drops
of
music
they
came
like
water
falling
a
long
way
into
a
cup
each
the
essential
quality
of
pure
sound
we
with
our
elaborate
harmonies
have
forgotten
the
charm
of
single
notes
the
african
natives
know
it
and
i
remember
a
learned
man
once
telling
me
that
the
greeks
had
the
same
art
those
silver
bells
broke
out
of
infinite
space
so
exquisite
and
perfect
that
no
mortal
words
could
have
been
fitted
to
them
that
was
the
music
i
expect
that
the
morning
stars
made
when
they
sang
together
slowly
very
slowly
it
changed
the
glow
passed
from
blue
to
purple
and
then
to
an
angry
red
bit
by
bit
the
notes
spun
together
till
they
had
made
a
harmony
a
fierce
restless
harmony
and
i
was
conscious
again
of
the
dancers
beckoning
out
of
their
circle
there
was
no
mistake
about
the
meaning
now
all
the
daintiness
and
youth
had
fled
and
passion
was
beating
the
air
terrible
savage
passion
which
belonged
neither
to
day
nor
night
life
nor
death
but
to
the
between
them
i
suddenly
felt
the
dancers
as
monstrous
inhuman
devilish
the
thick
scents
that
floated
from
the
brazier
seemed
to
have
a
tang
of
blood
cries
broke
from
the
hearers
cries
of
anger
and
lust
and
terror
i
heard
a
woman
sob
and
peter
who
is
as
tough
as
any
mortal
took
tight
hold
of
my
arm
i
now
realized
that
these
companions
of
the
rosy
hours
were
the
only
thing
in
the
world
to
fear
rasta
and
stumm
seemed
feeble
simpletons
by
contrast
the
window
i
had
been
looking
out
of
was
changed
to
a
prison
wall
i
could
see
the
mortar
between
the
massive
blocks
in
a
second
these
devils
would
be
smelling
out
their
enemies
like
some
foul
i
felt
the
burning
eyes
of
their
leader
looking
for
me
in
the
gloom
peter
was
praying
audibly
beside
me
and
i
could
have
choked
him
his
infernal
chatter
would
reveal
us
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
was
no
one
in
the
place
except
us
and
the
then
suddenly
the
spell
was
broken
the
door
was
flung
open
and
a
great
gust
of
icy
wind
swirled
through
the
hall
driving
clouds
of
ashes
from
the
braziers
i
heard
loud
voices
without
and
a
hubbub
began
inside
for
a
moment
it
was
quite
dark
and
then
someone
lit
one
of
the
flare
lamps
by
the
stage
it
revealed
nothing
but
the
common
squalor
of
a
low
saloon
white
faces
sleepy
eyes
and
frowsy
heads
the
was
there
in
all
its
tawdriness
the
companions
of
the
rosy
hours
had
gone
but
at
the
door
stood
men
in
uniform
i
heard
a
german
a
long
way
off
murmur
bodyguards
and
i
heard
him
distinctly
for
though
i
could
not
see
clearly
my
hearing
was
desperately
acute
that
is
often
the
way
when
you
suddenly
come
out
of
a
swoon
the
place
emptied
like
magic
turk
and
german
tumbled
over
each
other
while
kuprasso
wailed
and
wept
no
one
seemed
to
stop
them
and
then
i
saw
the
reason
those
guards
had
come
for
us
this
must
be
stumm
at
last
the
authorities
had
tracked
us
down
and
it
was
all
up
with
peter
and
me
a
sudden
revulsion
leaves
a
man
with
a
low
vitality
i
did
seem
to
care
greatly
we
were
done
and
there
was
an
end
of
it
it
was
kismet
the
act
of
god
and
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
submit
i
had
a
flicker
of
a
thought
of
escape
or
resistance
the
game
was
utterly
and
absolutely
over
a
man
who
seemed
to
be
a
sergeant
pointed
to
us
and
said
something
to
kuprasso
who
nodded
we
got
heavily
to
our
feet
and
stumbled
towards
them
with
one
on
each
side
of
us
we
crossed
the
yard
walked
through
the
dark
passage
and
the
empty
shop
and
out
into
the
snowy
street
there
was
a
closed
carriage
waiting
which
they
motioned
us
to
get
into
it
looked
exactly
like
the
black
maria
both
of
us
sat
still
like
truant
schoolboys
with
our
hands
on
our
knees
i
did
know
where
i
was
going
and
i
did
care
we
seemed
to
be
rumbling
up
the
hill
and
then
i
caught
the
glare
of
lighted
streets
is
the
end
of
it
peter
i
said
cornelis
he
replied
and
that
was
all
our
talk
by
and
by
hours
later
it
seemed
we
stopped
someone
opened
the
door
and
we
got
out
to
find
ourselves
in
a
courtyard
with
a
huge
dark
building
around
the
prison
i
guessed
and
i
wondered
if
they
would
give
us
blankets
for
it
was
perishing
cold
we
entered
a
door
and
found
ourselves
in
a
big
stone
hall
it
was
quite
warm
which
made
me
more
hopeful
about
our
cells
a
man
in
some
kind
of
uniform
pointed
to
the
staircase
up
which
we
plodded
wearily
my
mind
was
too
blank
to
take
clear
impressions
or
in
any
way
to
forecast
the
future
another
warder
met
us
and
took
us
down
a
passage
till
we
halted
at
a
door
he
stood
aside
and
motioned
us
to
enter
i
guessed
that
this
was
the
governor
room
and
we
should
be
put
through
our
first
examination
my
head
was
too
stupid
to
think
and
i
made
up
my
mind
to
keep
perfectly
mum
yes
even
if
they
tried
thumbscrews
i
had
no
kind
of
story
but
i
resolved
not
to
give
anything
away
as
i
turned
the
handle
i
wondered
idly
what
kind
of
sallow
turk
or
german
we
should
find
inside
it
was
a
pleasant
room
with
a
polished
wood
floor
and
a
big
fire
burning
on
the
hearth
beside
the
fire
a
man
lay
on
a
couch
with
a
little
table
drawn
up
beside
him
on
that
table
was
a
small
glass
of
milk
and
a
number
of
patience
cards
spread
in
rows
i
stared
blankly
at
the
spectacle
till
i
saw
a
second
figure
it
was
the
man
in
the
the
leader
of
the
dancing
maniacs
both
peter
and
i
backed
sharply
at
the
sight
and
then
stood
stock
still
for
the
dancer
crossed
the
room
in
two
strides
and
gripped
both
of
my
hands
old
man
he
cried
most
awfully
glad
to
see
you
again
chapter
twelve
four
missionaries
see
light
in
their
mission
a
spasm
of
incredulity
a
vast
relief
and
that
sharp
joy
which
comes
of
reaction
chased
each
other
across
my
mind
i
had
come
suddenly
out
of
very
black
waters
into
an
unbelievable
calm
i
dropped
into
the
nearest
chair
and
tried
to
grapple
with
something
far
beyond
words
i
said
as
soon
as
i
got
my
breath
an
incarnate
devil
you
given
peter
and
me
the
fright
of
our
lives
was
the
only
way
dick
if
i
had
come
mewing
like
a
at
your
heels
yesterday
rasta
would
have
had
you
long
before
you
got
to
your
hotel
you
two
have
given
me
a
pretty
anxious
time
and
it
took
some
doing
to
get
you
safe
here
however
that
is
all
over
now
make
yourselves
at
home
my
children
i
cried
incredulously
for
my
wits
were
still
place
is
this
may
call
it
my
humble
home
it
was
blenkiron
sleek
voice
that
spoke
been
preparing
for
you
major
but
it
was
only
yesterday
i
heard
of
your
friend
i
introduced
peter
pienaar
said
blenkiron
to
meet
you
well
as
i
was
observing
you
safe
enough
here
but
you
cut
it
mighty
fine
officially
a
dutchman
called
brandt
was
to
be
arrested
this
afternoon
and
handed
over
to
the
german
authorities
when
germany
begins
to
trouble
about
that
dutchman
she
will
find
difficulty
in
getting
the
body
but
such
are
the
languid
ways
of
an
oriental
despotism
meantime
the
dutchman
will
be
no
more
he
will
have
ceased
upon
the
midnight
without
pain
as
your
poet
sings
i
do
understand
i
stammered
arrested
us
men
said
sandy
have
a
bit
of
a
graft
here
and
it
difficult
to
manage
it
old
moellendorff
will
be
nosing
after
the
business
tomorrow
but
he
will
find
the
mystery
too
deep
for
him
that
is
the
advantage
of
a
government
run
by
a
pack
of
adventurers
but
by
jove
dick
we
had
any
time
to
spare
if
rasta
had
got
you
or
the
germans
had
had
the
job
of
lifting
you
your
goose
would
have
been
jolly
well
cooked
i
had
some
unquiet
hours
this
morning
the
thing
was
too
deep
for
me
i
looked
at
blenkiron
shuffling
his
patience
cards
with
his
old
sleepy
smile
and
sandy
dressed
like
some
bandit
in
melodrama
his
lean
face
as
brown
as
a
nut
his
bare
arms
all
tattooed
with
crimson
rings
and
the
fox
pelt
drawn
tight
over
brow
and
ears
it
was
still
a
nightmare
world
but
the
dream
was
getting
pleasanter
peter
said
not
a
word
but
i
could
see
his
eyes
heavy
with
his
own
thoughts
blenkiron
hove
himself
from
the
sofa
and
waddled
to
a
cupboard
boys
must
be
hungry
he
said
has
been
giving
me
hell
as
usual
and
i
do
eat
no
more
than
a
squirrel
but
i
laid
in
some
stores
for
i
guessed
you
would
want
to
stoke
up
some
after
your
travels
he
brought
out
a
couple
of
strassburg
pies
a
cheese
a
cold
chicken
a
loaf
and
three
bottles
of
champagne
said
sandy
rapturously
a
dry
heidsieck
too
we
in
luck
dick
old
man
i
never
ate
a
more
welcome
meal
for
we
had
starved
in
that
dirty
hotel
but
i
had
still
the
old
feeling
of
the
hunted
and
before
i
began
i
asked
about
the
door
all
right
said
sandy
fellows
are
on
the
stair
and
at
the
gate
if
the
are
in
possession
you
may
bet
that
other
people
will
keep
off
your
past
is
blotted
out
clean
vanished
away
and
you
begin
tomorrow
morning
with
a
new
sheet
blenkiron
the
man
you
got
to
thank
for
that
he
was
pretty
certain
you
get
here
but
he
was
also
certain
that
you
arrive
in
a
hurry
with
a
good
many
inquirers
behind
you
so
he
arranged
that
you
should
leak
away
and
start
fresh
name
is
richard
hanau
blenkiron
said
in
cleveland
ohio
of
german
parentage
on
both
sides
one
of
our
brightest
and
the
apple
of
guggenheim
eye
you
arrived
this
afternoon
from
constanza
and
i
met
you
at
the
packet
the
clothes
for
the
part
are
in
your
bedroom
next
door
but
i
guess
all
that
can
wait
for
i
anxious
to
get
to
business
we
not
here
on
a
major
so
i
reckon
we
leave
out
the
adventures
i
just
dying
to
hear
them
but
they
keep
i
want
to
know
how
our
mutual
inquiries
have
prospered
he
gave
peter
and
me
cigars
and
we
sat
ourselves
in
armchairs
in
front
of
the
blaze
sandy
squatted
on
the
hearthrug
and
lit
a
foul
old
briar
pipe
which
he
extricated
from
some
pouch
among
his
skins
and
so
began
that
conversation
which
had
never
been
out
of
my
thoughts
for
four
hectic
weeks
i
presume
to
begin
said
blenkiron
because
i
reckon
my
story
is
the
shortest
i
have
to
confess
to
you
gentlemen
that
i
have
failed
he
drew
down
the
corners
of
his
mouth
till
he
looked
a
cross
between
a
comedian
and
a
sick
child
you
were
looking
for
something
in
the
root
of
the
hedge
you
would
want
to
scour
the
road
in
a
automobile
and
still
less
would
you
want
to
get
a
view
in
an
aeroplane
that
parable
about
fits
my
case
i
have
been
in
the
clouds
and
i
been
scorching
on
the
pikes
but
what
i
was
wanting
was
in
the
ditch
all
the
time
and
i
naturally
missed
it
i
had
the
wrong
stunt
major
i
was
too
high
up
and
refined
i
been
processing
through
europe
like
barnum
circus
and
living
with
generals
and
transparencies
not
that
i
have
picked
up
a
lot
of
noos
and
got
some
very
interesting
sidelights
on
high
politics
but
the
thing
i
was
after
was
to
be
found
on
my
beat
for
those
that
knew
it
were
going
to
tell
in
that
kind
of
society
they
do
get
drunk
and
blab
after
their
tenth
cocktail
so
i
guess
i
no
contribution
to
make
to
quieting
sir
walter
bullivant
mind
except
that
he
dead
right
yes
sir
he
has
hit
the
spot
and
rung
the
bell
there
is
a
mighty
proposition
being
floated
in
these
parts
but
the
promoters
are
keeping
it
to
themselves
they
are
taking
in
more
than
they
can
help
on
the
blenkiron
stopped
to
light
a
fresh
cigar
he
was
leaner
than
when
he
left
london
and
there
were
pouches
below
his
eyes
i
fancy
his
journey
had
not
been
as
as
he
made
out
found
out
one
thing
and
that
is
that
the
last
dream
germany
will
part
with
is
the
control
of
the
near
east
that
is
what
your
statesmen
do
figure
enough
on
she
give
up
belgium
and
and
poland
but
by
god
she
never
give
up
the
road
to
mesopotamia
till
you
have
her
by
the
throat
and
make
her
drop
it
sir
walter
is
a
pretty
citizen
and
he
sees
it
right
enough
if
the
worst
happens
kaiser
will
fling
overboard
a
lot
of
ballast
in
europe
and
it
will
look
like
a
big
victory
for
the
allies
but
he
wo
be
beaten
if
he
has
the
road
to
the
east
safe
germany
like
a
scorpion
her
sting
in
her
tail
and
that
tail
stretches
way
down
into
asia
got
that
clear
and
i
also
made
out
that
it
was
going
to
be
dead
easy
for
her
to
keep
that
tail
healthy
turkey
a
bit
of
an
anxiety
as
you
soon
discover
but
germany
thinks
she
can
manage
it
and
i
wo
say
she
ca
it
depends
on
the
hand
she
holds
and
she
reckons
it
a
good
one
i
tried
to
find
out
but
they
gave
me
nothing
but
eyewash
i
had
to
pretend
to
be
satisfied
for
the
position
of
john
was
so
strong
as
to
allow
him
to
take
liberties
if
i
asked
one
of
the
highbrows
he
looked
wise
and
spoke
of
the
might
of
german
arms
and
german
organization
and
german
i
used
to
nod
my
head
and
get
enthusiastic
about
these
stunts
but
it
was
all
soft
soap
she
has
a
trick
in
hand
that
much
i
know
but
i
darned
if
i
can
put
a
name
to
it
i
pray
to
god
you
boys
have
been
cleverer
his
tone
was
quite
melancholy
and
i
was
mean
enough
to
feel
rather
glad
he
had
been
the
professional
with
the
best
chance
it
would
be
a
good
joke
if
the
amateur
succeeded
where
the
expert
failed
i
looked
at
sandy
he
filled
his
pipe
again
and
pushed
back
his
skin
cap
from
his
brows
what
with
his
long
dishevelled
hair
his
face
and
stained
eyebrows
he
had
the
appearance
of
some
mad
mullah
went
straight
to
smyrna
he
said
was
difficult
for
you
see
i
had
laid
down
a
good
many
lines
in
former
travels
i
reached
the
town
as
a
greek
from
the
fayum
but
i
had
friends
there
i
could
count
on
and
the
same
evening
i
was
a
turkish
gipsy
a
member
of
the
most
famous
fraternity
in
western
asia
i
had
long
been
a
member
and
i
of
the
chief
boss
so
i
stepped
into
the
part
ready
made
but
i
found
out
that
the
company
of
the
rosy
hours
was
not
what
i
had
known
it
in
then
it
had
been
all
for
the
young
turks
and
reform
now
it
hankered
after
the
old
regime
and
was
the
last
hope
of
the
orthodox
it
had
no
use
for
enver
and
his
friends
and
it
did
not
regard
with
pleasure
the
of
the
teuton
it
stood
for
islam
and
the
old
ways
and
might
be
described
as
a
caucus
but
it
was
uncommon
powerful
in
the
provinces
and
enver
and
talaat
dare
meddle
with
it
the
dangerous
thing
about
it
was
that
it
said
nothing
and
apparently
did
nothing
it
just
bided
its
time
and
took
notes
can
imagine
that
this
was
the
very
kind
of
crowd
for
my
purpose
i
knew
of
old
its
little
ways
for
with
all
its
orthodoxy
it
dabbled
a
good
deal
in
magic
and
owed
half
its
power
to
its
atmosphere
of
the
uncanny
the
companions
could
dance
the
heart
out
of
the
ordinary
turk
you
saw
a
bit
of
one
of
our
dances
this
afternoon
dick
pretty
good
was
it
they
could
go
anywhere
and
no
questions
asked
they
knew
what
the
ordinary
man
was
thinking
for
they
were
the
best
intelligence
department
in
the
ottoman
empire
far
better
than
and
they
were
popular
too
for
they
had
never
bowed
the
knee
to
the
the
germans
who
are
squeezing
out
the
of
the
osmanli
for
their
own
ends
it
would
have
been
as
much
as
the
life
of
the
committee
or
its
german
masters
was
worth
to
lay
a
hand
on
us
for
we
clung
together
like
leeches
and
we
were
not
in
the
habit
of
sticking
at
trifles
you
may
imagine
it
was
difficult
for
me
to
move
where
i
wanted
my
dress
and
the
franked
me
anywhere
i
travelled
from
smyrna
by
the
new
railway
to
panderma
on
the
marmora
and
got
there
just
before
christmas
that
was
after
anzac
and
suvla
had
been
evacuated
but
i
could
hear
the
guns
going
hard
at
cape
helles
from
panderma
i
started
to
cross
to
thrace
in
a
coasting
steamer
and
there
an
uncommon
funny
thing
happened
i
got
torpedoed
must
have
been
about
the
last
effort
of
a
british
submarine
in
those
waters
but
she
got
us
all
right
she
gave
us
ten
minutes
to
take
to
the
boats
and
then
sent
the
blighted
old
packet
and
a
fine
cargo
of
shells
to
the
bottom
there
were
many
passengers
so
it
was
easy
enough
to
get
ashore
in
the
ship
boats
the
submarine
sat
on
the
surface
watching
us
as
we
wailed
and
howled
in
the
true
oriental
way
and
i
saw
the
captain
quite
close
in
the
who
do
you
think
it
was
tommy
elliot
who
lives
on
the
other
side
of
the
hill
from
me
at
home
gave
tommy
the
surprise
of
his
life
as
we
bumped
past
him
i
started
the
flowers
of
the
forest
the
old
version
on
the
antique
stringed
instrument
i
carried
and
i
sang
the
words
very
plain
tommy
eyes
bulged
out
of
his
head
and
he
shouted
at
me
in
english
to
know
who
the
devil
i
was
i
replied
in
the
broadest
scots
which
no
man
in
the
submarine
or
in
our
boat
could
have
understood
a
word
of
maister
tammy
i
cried
what
for
wad
ye
skail
a
dacent
tinkler
lad
intil
a
cauld
sea
i
gie
ye
your
kail
through
the
reek
for
this
ploy
the
next
time
i
forgaither
wi
ye
on
the
tap
o
caerdon
spotted
me
in
a
second
he
laughed
till
he
cried
and
as
we
moved
off
shouted
to
me
in
the
same
language
to
pit
a
stoot
hert
tae
a
stey
brae
i
hope
to
heaven
he
had
the
sense
not
to
tell
my
father
or
the
old
man
will
have
had
a
fit
he
never
much
approved
of
my
wanderings
and
thought
i
was
safely
anchored
in
the
battalion
to
make
a
long
story
short
i
got
to
constantinople
and
pretty
soon
found
touch
with
blenkiron
the
rest
you
know
and
now
for
business
i
have
been
fairly
lucky
but
no
more
for
i
have
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
thing
nor
anything
like
it
but
i
solved
the
first
of
harry
bullivant
riddles
i
know
the
meaning
of
walter
was
right
as
blenkiron
has
told
us
there
a
great
stirring
in
islam
something
moving
on
the
face
of
the
waters
they
make
no
secret
of
it
those
religious
revivals
come
in
cycles
and
one
was
due
about
now
and
they
are
quite
clear
about
the
details
a
seer
has
arisen
of
the
blood
of
the
prophet
who
will
restore
the
khalifate
to
its
old
glories
and
islam
to
its
old
purity
his
sayings
are
everywhere
in
the
moslem
world
all
the
orthodox
believers
have
them
by
heart
that
is
why
they
are
enduring
grinding
poverty
and
preposterous
taxation
and
that
is
why
their
young
men
are
rolling
up
to
the
armies
and
dying
without
complaint
in
gallipoli
and
transcaucasia
they
believe
they
are
on
the
eve
of
a
great
deliverance
the
first
thing
i
found
out
was
that
the
young
turks
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
they
are
unpopular
and
unorthodox
and
no
true
turks
but
germany
has
how
i
do
know
but
i
could
see
quite
plainly
that
in
some
subtle
way
germany
was
regarded
as
a
collaborator
in
the
movement
it
is
that
belief
that
is
keeping
the
present
regime
going
the
ordinary
turk
loathes
the
committee
but
he
has
some
queer
perverted
expectation
from
germany
it
is
not
a
case
of
enver
and
the
rest
carrying
on
their
shoulders
the
unpopular
teuton
it
is
a
case
of
the
teuton
carrying
the
unpopular
committee
and
germany
graft
is
just
this
and
nothing
more
that
she
has
some
hand
in
the
coming
of
the
new
deliverer
talk
about
the
thing
quite
openly
it
is
called
the
the
palladium
of
liberty
the
prophet
himself
is
known
as
zimrud
the
emerald
and
his
four
ministers
are
called
also
after
jewels
sapphire
ruby
pearl
and
topaz
you
will
hear
their
names
as
often
in
the
talk
of
the
towns
and
villages
as
you
will
hear
the
names
of
generals
in
england
but
no
one
knew
where
zimrud
was
or
when
he
would
reveal
himself
though
every
week
came
his
messages
to
the
faithful
all
that
i
could
learn
was
that
he
and
his
followers
were
coming
from
the
west
will
say
what
about
that
puzzled
me
dreadfully
for
no
one
used
the
phrase
the
home
of
the
spirit
it
is
an
obvious
cliche
just
as
in
england
some
new
sect
might
call
itself
the
church
of
christ
only
no
one
seemed
to
use
it
by
and
by
i
discovered
that
there
was
an
inner
and
an
outer
circle
in
this
mystery
every
creed
has
an
esoteric
side
which
is
kept
from
the
common
herd
i
struck
this
side
in
constantinople
now
there
is
a
very
famous
turkish
called
one
of
those
old
miracle
plays
with
an
allegorical
meaning
which
they
call
and
which
take
a
week
to
read
that
tale
tells
of
the
coming
of
a
prophet
and
i
found
that
the
select
of
the
faith
spoke
of
the
new
revelation
in
terms
of
it
the
curious
thing
is
that
in
that
tale
the
prophet
is
aided
by
one
of
the
few
women
who
play
much
part
in
the
hagiology
of
islam
that
is
the
point
of
the
tale
and
it
is
partly
a
jest
but
mainly
a
religious
mystery
the
prophet
too
is
not
called
emerald
know
i
said
is
called
greenmantle
sandy
scrambled
to
his
feet
letting
his
pipe
drop
in
the
fireplace
how
on
earth
did
you
find
out
that
he
cried
then
i
told
them
of
stumm
and
gaudian
and
the
whispered
words
i
had
not
been
meant
to
hear
blenkiron
was
giving
me
the
benefit
of
a
steady
stare
unusual
from
one
who
seemed
always
to
have
his
eyes
abstracted
and
sandy
had
taken
to
ranging
up
and
down
the
room
in
the
heart
of
the
plan
that
is
what
i
always
thought
if
we
to
find
the
it
is
no
good
fossicking
among
the
committee
or
in
the
turkish
provinces
the
secret
in
germany
dick
you
should
not
have
crossed
the
danube
what
i
half
feared
i
said
on
the
other
hand
it
is
obvious
that
the
thing
must
come
east
and
sooner
rather
than
later
i
take
it
they
ca
afford
to
delay
too
long
before
they
deliver
the
goods
if
we
can
stick
it
out
here
we
must
hit
the
trail
i
got
another
bit
of
evidence
i
have
solved
harry
bullivant
third
puzzle
sandy
eyes
were
very
bright
and
i
had
an
audience
on
wires
you
say
that
in
the
tale
of
a
woman
is
the
ally
of
the
prophet
said
sandy
of
that
that
the
same
thing
is
true
of
greenmantle
i
can
give
you
her
name
i
fetched
a
piece
of
paper
and
a
pencil
from
blenkiron
desk
and
handed
it
to
sandy
down
harry
bullivant
third
word
he
promptly
wrote
down
then
i
told
them
of
the
other
name
stumm
and
gaudian
had
spoken
i
told
of
my
discovery
as
i
lay
in
the
woodman
cottage
i
is
not
the
letter
of
the
alphabet
but
the
numeral
the
name
is
von
einem
hilda
von
einem
old
harry
said
sandy
softly
was
a
dashed
clever
chap
hilda
von
einem
who
and
where
is
she
for
if
we
find
her
we
have
done
the
trick
then
blenkiron
spoke
reckon
i
can
put
you
wise
on
that
gentlemen
he
said
saw
her
no
later
than
yesterday
she
is
a
lovely
lady
she
happens
also
to
be
the
owner
of
this
house
both
sandy
and
i
began
to
laugh
it
was
too
comic
to
have
stumbled
across
europe
and
lighted
on
the
very
headquarters
of
the
puzzle
we
had
set
out
to
unriddle
but
blenkiron
did
not
laugh
at
the
mention
of
hilda
von
einem
he
had
suddenly
become
very
solemn
and
the
sight
of
his
face
pulled
me
up
short
do
like
it
gentlemen
he
said
would
rather
you
had
mentioned
any
other
name
on
god
earth
i
have
been
long
in
this
city
but
i
have
been
long
enough
to
size
up
the
various
political
bosses
they
have
much
to
them
i
reckon
they
would
stand
up
against
what
we
could
show
them
in
the
states
but
i
have
met
the
frau
von
einem
and
that
lady
a
very
different
proposition
the
man
that
will
understand
her
has
got
to
take
a
biggish
size
in
hats
is
she
i
asked
that
is
just
what
i
ca
tell
you
she
was
a
great
excavator
of
babylonish
and
hittite
ruins
and
she
married
a
diplomat
who
went
to
glory
three
years
back
it
is
what
she
has
been
but
what
she
is
and
that
a
mighty
clever
woman
blenkiron
respect
did
not
depress
me
i
felt
as
if
at
last
we
had
got
our
job
narrowed
to
a
decent
compass
for
i
had
hated
casting
about
in
the
dark
i
asked
where
she
lived
i
do
know
said
blenkiron
wo
find
people
unduly
anxious
to
gratify
your
natural
curiosity
about
frau
von
einem
can
find
that
out
said
sandy
the
advantage
of
having
a
push
like
mine
meantime
i
got
to
clear
for
my
day
work
finished
dick
you
and
peter
must
go
to
bed
at
once
i
asked
in
amazement
sandy
spoke
like
a
medical
adviser
i
want
your
clothes
the
things
you
got
on
now
i
take
them
off
with
me
and
you
never
see
them
again
a
queer
taste
in
souvenirs
i
said
rather
the
turkish
police
the
current
in
the
bosporus
is
pretty
strong
and
these
sad
relics
of
two
misguided
dutchmen
will
be
washed
up
tomorrow
about
seraglio
point
in
this
game
you
must
drop
the
curtain
neat
and
pat
at
the
end
of
each
scene
if
you
do
want
trouble
later
with
the
missing
heir
and
the
family
lawyer
chapter
thirteen
i
move
in
good
society
i
walked
out
of
that
house
next
morning
with
blenkiron
arm
in
mine
a
different
being
from
the
friendless
creature
who
had
looked
vainly
the
day
before
for
sanctuary
to
begin
with
i
was
splendidly
dressed
i
had
a
suit
with
square
padded
shoulders
a
neat
black
shoes
with
a
hump
at
the
toe
and
a
brown
bowler
over
that
i
wore
a
greatcoat
lined
with
wolf
fur
i
had
a
smart
malacca
cane
and
one
of
blenkiron
cigars
in
my
mouth
peter
had
been
made
to
trim
his
beard
and
dressed
in
unassuming
looked
with
his
docile
eyes
and
quiet
voice
a
very
respectable
servant
old
blenkiron
had
done
the
job
in
style
for
if
you
believe
it
he
had
brought
the
clothes
all
the
way
from
london
i
realized
now
why
he
and
sandy
had
been
fossicking
in
my
wardrobe
peter
suit
had
been
of
procuring
and
it
was
not
the
fit
of
mine
i
had
no
difficulty
about
the
accent
any
man
brought
up
in
the
colonies
can
get
his
tongue
round
american
and
i
flattered
myself
i
made
a
very
fair
shape
at
the
lingo
of
the
middle
west
the
wind
had
gone
to
the
south
and
the
snow
was
melting
fast
there
was
a
blue
sky
above
asia
and
away
to
the
north
masses
of
white
cloud
drifting
over
the
black
sea
what
had
seemed
the
day
before
the
dingiest
of
cities
now
took
on
a
strange
beauty
the
beauty
of
unexpected
horizons
and
tongues
of
grey
water
winding
below
shores
a
man
temper
has
a
lot
to
do
with
his
appreciation
of
scenery
i
felt
a
free
man
once
more
and
could
use
my
eyes
that
street
was
a
jumble
of
every
nationality
on
earth
there
were
turkish
regulars
in
their
queer
conical
khaki
helmets
and
levies
who
had
no
kin
with
europe
there
were
squads
of
germans
in
flat
staring
vacantly
at
novel
sights
and
quick
to
salute
any
officer
on
the
turks
in
closed
carriages
passed
and
turks
on
good
arab
horses
and
turks
who
looked
as
if
they
had
come
out
of
the
ark
but
it
was
the
rabble
that
caught
the
eye
very
wild
pinched
miserable
rabble
i
never
in
my
life
saw
such
swarms
of
beggars
and
you
walked
down
that
street
to
the
accompaniment
of
entreaties
for
alms
in
all
the
tongues
of
the
tower
of
babel
blenkiron
and
i
behaved
as
if
we
were
interested
tourists
we
would
stop
and
laugh
at
one
fellow
and
give
a
penny
to
a
second
passing
comments
in
western
voices
we
went
into
a
cafe
and
had
a
cup
of
coffee
a
beggar
came
in
and
asked
alms
hitherto
blenkiron
purse
had
been
closed
but
now
he
took
out
some
small
nickels
and
planked
five
down
on
the
table
the
man
cried
down
blessings
and
picked
up
three
blenkiron
very
swiftly
swept
the
other
two
into
his
pocket
that
seemed
to
me
queer
and
i
remarked
that
i
had
never
before
seen
a
beggar
who
gave
change
blenkiron
said
nothing
and
presently
we
moved
on
and
came
to
the
there
were
a
number
of
small
tugs
moored
alongside
and
one
or
two
bigger
craft
fruit
boats
i
judged
which
used
to
ply
in
the
aegean
they
looked
pretty
well
from
disuse
we
stopped
at
one
of
them
and
watched
a
fellow
in
a
blue
nightcap
splicing
ropes
he
raised
his
eyes
once
and
looked
at
us
and
then
kept
on
with
his
business
blenkiron
asked
him
where
he
came
from
but
he
shook
his
head
not
understanding
the
tongue
a
turkish
policeman
came
up
and
stared
at
us
suspiciously
till
blenkiron
opened
his
coat
as
if
by
accident
and
displayed
a
tiny
square
of
ribbon
at
which
he
saluted
failing
to
make
conversation
with
the
sailor
blenkiron
flung
him
three
of
his
black
cigars
guess
you
can
smoke
friend
if
you
ca
talk
he
said
the
man
turned
and
caught
the
three
neatly
in
the
air
then
to
my
amazement
he
tossed
one
of
them
back
the
donor
regarded
it
quizzically
as
it
lay
on
the
pavement
boy
a
connoisseur
of
tobacco
he
said
as
we
moved
away
i
saw
the
turkish
policeman
pick
it
up
and
put
it
inside
his
cap
we
returned
by
the
long
street
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
there
was
a
man
selling
oranges
on
a
tray
and
blenkiron
stopped
to
look
at
them
i
noticed
that
the
man
shuffled
fifteen
into
a
cluster
blenkiron
felt
the
oranges
as
if
to
see
that
they
were
sound
and
pushed
two
aside
the
man
instantly
restored
them
to
the
group
never
raising
his
eyes
ai
the
time
of
year
to
buy
fruit
said
blenkiron
as
we
passed
on
oranges
are
rotten
as
medlars
we
were
almost
on
our
own
doorstep
before
i
guessed
the
meaning
of
the
business
your
morning
work
finished
i
said
morning
walk
he
asked
innocently
said
work
he
smiled
blandly
reckoned
you
tumble
to
it
why
yes
except
that
i
some
figuring
still
to
do
give
me
half
an
hour
and
i
be
at
your
service
major
that
afternoon
after
peter
had
cooked
a
wonderfully
good
luncheon
i
had
a
talk
with
blenkiron
business
is
to
get
noos
he
said
before
i
start
on
a
stunt
i
make
considerable
preparations
all
the
time
in
london
when
i
was
yelping
at
the
british
government
i
was
busy
with
sir
walter
arranging
things
ahead
we
used
to
meet
in
queer
places
and
at
all
hours
of
the
night
i
fixed
up
a
lot
of
connections
in
this
city
before
i
arrived
and
especially
a
noos
service
with
your
foreign
office
by
way
of
rumania
and
russia
in
a
day
or
two
i
guess
our
friends
will
know
all
about
our
discoveries
at
that
i
opened
my
eyes
very
wide
yes
you
britishers
have
any
notion
how
your
intelligence
service
is
i
reckon
it
easy
the
best
of
all
the
belligerents
you
never
talked
about
it
in
peace
time
and
you
shunned
the
theatrical
ways
of
the
teuton
but
you
had
the
wires
laid
good
and
sure
i
calculate
there
is
much
that
happens
in
any
corner
of
the
earth
that
you
do
know
within
hours
i
do
say
your
highbrows
use
the
noos
well
i
do
take
much
stock
in
your
political
push
they
a
lot
of
no
doubt
but
it
ai
oratory
that
is
wanted
in
this
racket
the
william
jennings
bryan
stunt
languishes
in
politics
is
like
a
and
those
inside
get
to
behave
as
if
their
little
run
were
all
the
world
but
if
the
politicians
make
mistakes
it
is
from
lack
of
good
instruction
to
guide
their
steps
if
i
had
a
big
proposition
to
handle
and
could
have
my
pick
of
helpers
i
plump
for
the
intelligence
department
of
the
british
admiralty
yes
sir
i
take
off
my
hat
to
your
government
sleuths
they
provide
you
with
spies
here
i
asked
in
astonishment
no
he
said
they
gave
me
the
key
and
i
could
make
my
own
arrangements
in
germany
i
buried
myself
deep
in
the
local
atmosphere
and
never
peeped
out
that
was
my
game
for
i
was
looking
for
something
in
germany
itself
and
did
want
any
foreign
as
you
know
i
failed
where
you
succeeded
but
so
soon
as
i
crossed
the
danube
i
set
about
opening
up
my
lines
of
communication
and
i
had
been
two
days
in
this
metropolis
before
i
had
got
my
telephone
exchange
buzzing
sometime
i
explain
the
thing
to
you
for
it
a
pretty
little
business
i
got
the
cutest
cypher
no
it
ai
my
invention
it
your
government
any
one
babe
imbecile
or
dotard
can
carry
my
messages
you
saw
some
of
them
today
but
it
takes
some
mind
to
set
the
piece
and
it
takes
a
lot
of
figuring
at
my
end
to
work
out
the
results
some
day
you
shall
hear
it
all
for
i
guess
it
would
please
you
do
you
use
it
i
asked
i
get
early
noos
of
what
is
going
on
in
this
likewise
i
get
authentic
noos
of
the
rest
of
europe
and
i
can
send
a
message
to
mr
in
petrograd
and
mr
in
london
or
if
i
wish
to
mr
in
noo
york
what
the
matter
with
that
for
a
i
the
best
informed
man
in
constantinople
for
old
general
liman
only
hears
one
side
and
mostly
lies
at
that
and
enver
prefers
not
to
listen
at
all
also
i
could
give
them
points
on
what
is
happening
at
their
very
door
for
our
friend
sandy
is
a
big
boss
in
the
crowd
of
mountebanks
that
ever
fiddled
secrets
out
of
men
hearts
without
their
help
i
would
have
cut
much
ice
in
this
city
want
you
to
tell
me
one
thing
blenkiron
i
said
been
playing
a
part
for
the
past
month
and
it
wears
my
nerves
to
tatters
is
this
job
very
tiring
for
if
it
is
i
doubt
i
may
buckle
up
he
looked
thoughtful
ca
call
our
business
an
absolute
any
time
you
got
to
keep
your
eyes
skinned
and
there
always
the
risk
of
the
little
packet
of
dynamite
going
off
unexpected
but
as
these
things
go
i
rate
this
stunt
as
easy
we
only
got
to
be
natural
we
wear
our
natural
clothes
and
talk
english
and
sport
a
teddy
roosevelt
smile
and
there
is
any
call
for
theatrical
talent
where
i
found
the
job
tight
was
when
i
had
got
to
be
natural
and
my
naturalness
was
the
same
brand
as
that
of
everybody
round
about
and
all
the
time
i
had
to
do
unnatural
things
it
is
easy
to
be
going
down
town
to
business
and
taking
cocktails
with
mr
carl
rosenheim
and
next
hour
being
engaged
trying
to
blow
mr
rosenheim
friends
and
it
is
easy
to
keep
up
a
part
which
is
clean
outside
your
ordinary
life
i
never
tried
that
my
line
has
always
been
to
keep
my
normal
personality
but
you
have
major
and
i
guess
you
found
it
wearing
a
mild
word
i
said
i
want
to
know
another
thing
it
seems
to
me
that
the
line
you
picked
is
as
good
as
could
be
but
it
a
line
it
commits
us
pretty
deep
and
it
wo
be
a
simple
job
to
drop
it
that
just
the
point
i
was
coming
to
he
said
was
going
to
put
you
wise
about
that
very
thing
when
i
started
out
i
figured
on
some
situation
like
this
i
argued
that
unless
i
had
a
very
clear
part
with
a
big
bluff
in
it
i
would
get
the
confidences
which
i
needed
we
got
to
be
at
the
heart
of
the
show
taking
a
real
hand
and
not
just
looking
on
so
i
settled
i
would
be
a
big
engineer
there
was
a
time
when
there
were
many
bigger
in
the
united
states
than
john
blenkiron
i
talked
large
about
what
might
be
done
in
mesopotamia
in
the
way
of
washing
the
british
down
the
river
well
that
talk
caught
on
they
knew
of
my
reputation
as
an
hydraulic
expert
and
they
were
tickled
to
death
to
rope
me
in
i
told
them
i
wanted
a
helper
and
i
told
them
about
my
friend
richard
hanau
as
good
a
german
as
ever
supped
sauerkraut
who
was
coming
through
russia
and
rumania
as
a
benevolent
neutral
but
when
he
got
to
constantinople
would
drop
his
neutrality
and
double
his
benevolence
they
got
reports
on
you
by
wire
from
the
states
i
arranged
that
before
i
left
london
so
you
going
to
be
welcomed
and
taken
to
their
bosoms
just
like
john
was
both
got
jobs
we
can
hold
down
and
now
you
in
these
pretty
clothes
you
the
dead
ringer
of
the
brightest
kind
of
american
engineer
but
we
ca
go
back
on
our
tracks
if
we
wanted
to
leave
for
constanza
next
week
they
be
very
polite
but
they
never
let
us
we
got
to
go
on
with
this
adventure
and
nose
our
way
down
into
mesopotamia
hoping
that
our
luck
will
hold
god
knows
how
we
will
get
out
of
it
but
it
no
good
going
out
to
meet
trouble
as
i
observed
before
i
believe
in
an
and
beneficent
providence
but
you
got
to
give
him
a
chance
i
am
bound
to
confess
the
prospect
staggered
me
we
might
be
let
in
for
fighting
and
worse
than
fighting
against
our
own
side
i
wondered
if
it
would
be
better
to
make
a
bolt
for
it
and
said
so
he
shook
his
head
reckon
not
in
the
first
place
we
finished
our
inquiries
we
got
greenmantle
located
right
enough
thanks
to
you
but
we
still
know
mighty
little
about
that
holy
man
in
the
second
place
it
wo
be
as
bad
as
you
think
this
show
lacks
cohesion
sir
it
is
not
going
to
last
for
ever
i
calculate
that
before
you
and
i
strike
the
site
of
the
garden
that
adam
and
eve
frequented
there
will
be
a
queer
turn
of
affairs
anyhow
it
good
enough
to
gamble
on
then
he
got
some
sheets
of
paper
and
drew
me
a
plan
of
the
dispositions
of
the
turkish
forces
i
had
no
notion
he
was
such
a
close
student
of
war
for
his
exposition
was
as
good
as
a
staff
lecture
he
made
out
that
the
situation
was
none
too
bright
anywhere
the
troops
released
from
gallipoli
wanted
a
lot
of
refitment
and
would
be
slow
in
reaching
the
transcaucasian
frontier
where
the
russians
were
threatening
the
army
of
syria
was
pretty
nearly
a
rabble
under
the
lunatic
djemal
there
was
the
foggiest
chance
of
a
serious
invasion
of
egypt
being
undertaken
only
in
mesopotamia
did
things
look
fairly
cheerful
owing
to
the
blunders
of
british
strategy
you
may
take
it
from
me
he
said
if
the
old
turk
mobilized
a
total
of
a
million
men
he
has
lost
per
cent
of
them
already
and
if
i
anything
of
a
prophet
he
going
pretty
soon
to
lose
more
he
tore
up
the
papers
and
enlarged
on
politics
reckon
i
got
the
measure
of
the
young
turks
and
their
precious
committee
those
boys
are
any
good
enver
bright
enough
and
for
sure
he
got
sand
he
stick
out
a
fight
like
a
vermont
but
he
lacks
the
larger
vision
sir
he
does
understand
the
intricacies
of
the
job
no
more
than
a
so
the
germans
play
with
him
till
his
temper
goes
and
he
bucks
like
a
mule
talaat
is
a
sulky
dog
who
wants
to
batter
mankind
with
a
club
both
these
boys
would
have
made
good
in
the
old
days
and
they
might
have
got
a
living
out
west
as
the
of
a
labour
union
they
about
the
class
of
jesse
james
or
billy
the
kid
excepting
that
they
and
can
patter
languages
but
they
have
the
organizing
power
to
manage
the
irish
vote
in
a
ward
election
their
one
notion
is
to
get
busy
with
their
firearms
and
people
are
getting
tired
of
the
black
hand
stunt
their
hold
on
the
country
is
just
the
hold
that
a
man
with
a
browning
has
over
a
crowd
with
the
cooler
heads
in
the
committee
are
growing
shy
of
them
and
an
old
fox
like
david
is
lying
low
till
his
time
comes
now
it
does
want
arguing
that
a
gang
of
that
kind
has
got
to
hang
close
together
or
they
may
hang
separately
they
got
no
grip
on
the
ordinary
turk
barring
the
fact
that
they
are
active
and
he
is
sleepy
and
that
they
got
their
guns
loaded
about
the
germans
here
i
asked
blenkiron
laughed
is
no
sort
of
a
happy
family
but
the
young
turks
know
that
without
the
german
boost
they
be
strung
up
like
haman
and
the
germans
ca
afford
to
neglect
an
ally
consider
what
would
happen
if
turkey
got
sick
of
the
game
and
made
a
separate
peace
the
road
would
be
open
for
russia
to
the
aegean
ferdy
of
bulgaria
would
take
his
depreciated
goods
to
the
other
market
and
not
waste
a
day
thinking
about
it
you
have
rumania
coming
in
on
the
side
things
would
look
pretty
black
for
that
control
of
the
near
east
on
which
germany
has
banked
her
winnings
kaiser
says
that
got
to
be
prevented
at
all
costs
but
how
is
it
going
to
be
done
blenkiron
face
had
become
very
solemn
again
wo
be
done
unless
germany
got
a
trump
card
to
play
her
game
mighty
near
bust
but
it
still
got
a
chance
and
that
chance
is
a
woman
and
an
old
man
i
reckon
our
landlady
has
a
bigger
brain
than
enver
and
liman
she
the
real
boss
of
the
show
when
i
came
here
i
reported
to
her
and
presently
you
got
to
do
the
same
i
am
curious
as
to
how
she
strike
you
for
i
free
to
admit
that
she
impressed
me
considerable
looks
as
if
our
job
were
a
long
way
from
the
end
i
said
scarcely
begun
said
blenkiron
that
talk
did
a
lot
to
cheer
my
spirits
for
i
realized
that
it
was
the
biggest
of
big
game
we
were
hunting
this
time
i
an
economical
soul
and
if
i
going
to
be
hanged
i
want
a
good
stake
for
my
neck
then
began
some
varied
experiences
i
used
to
wake
up
in
the
morning
wondering
where
i
should
be
at
night
and
yet
quite
pleased
at
the
uncertainty
greenmantle
became
a
sort
of
myth
with
me
somehow
i
could
fix
any
idea
in
my
head
of
what
he
was
like
the
nearest
i
got
was
a
picture
of
an
old
man
in
a
turban
coming
out
of
a
bottle
in
a
cloud
of
smoke
which
i
remembered
from
a
child
edition
of
the
but
if
he
was
dim
the
lady
was
dimmer
sometimes
i
thought
of
her
as
a
fat
old
german
crone
sometimes
as
a
woman
like
a
schoolmistress
with
thin
lips
and
eyeglasses
but
i
had
to
fit
the
east
into
the
picture
so
i
made
her
young
and
gave
her
a
touch
of
the
languid
houri
in
a
veil
i
was
always
wanting
to
pump
blenkiron
on
the
subject
but
he
shut
up
like
a
he
was
looking
for
bad
trouble
in
that
direction
and
was
disinclined
to
speak
about
it
beforehand
we
led
a
peaceful
existence
our
servants
were
two
of
sandy
lot
for
blenkiron
had
very
rightly
cleared
out
the
turkish
caretakers
and
they
worked
like
beavers
under
peter
eye
till
i
reflected
i
had
never
been
so
well
looked
after
in
my
life
i
walked
about
the
city
with
blenkiron
keeping
my
eyes
open
and
speaking
very
civil
the
third
night
we
were
bidden
to
dinner
at
moellendorff
so
we
put
on
our
best
clothes
and
set
out
in
an
ancient
cab
blenkiron
had
fetched
a
dress
suit
of
mine
from
which
my
own
tailor
label
had
been
cut
and
a
new
york
one
substituted
general
liman
and
metternich
the
ambassador
had
gone
up
the
line
to
nish
to
meet
the
kaiser
who
was
touring
in
those
parts
so
moellendorff
was
the
biggest
german
in
the
city
he
was
a
thin
fellow
cleverish
but
monstrously
vain
and
he
was
not
very
popular
either
with
the
germans
or
the
turks
he
was
polite
to
both
of
us
but
i
am
bound
to
say
that
i
got
a
bad
fright
when
i
entered
the
room
for
the
first
man
i
saw
was
gaudian
i
doubt
if
he
would
have
recognized
me
even
in
the
clothes
i
had
worn
in
stumm
company
for
his
eyesight
was
wretched
as
it
was
i
ran
no
risk
in
with
my
hair
brushed
back
and
a
fine
american
accent
i
paid
him
high
compliments
as
a
fellow
engineer
and
translated
part
of
a
very
technical
conversation
between
him
and
blenkiron
gaudian
was
in
uniform
and
i
liked
the
look
of
his
honest
face
better
than
ever
but
the
great
event
was
the
sight
of
enver
he
was
a
slim
fellow
of
rasta
build
very
foppish
and
precise
in
his
dress
with
a
smooth
oval
face
like
a
girl
and
rather
fine
straight
black
eyebrows
he
spoke
perfect
german
and
had
the
best
kind
of
manners
neither
pert
nor
overbearing
he
had
a
pleasant
trick
too
of
appealing
all
round
the
table
for
confirmation
and
so
bringing
everybody
into
the
talk
not
that
he
spoke
a
great
deal
but
all
he
said
was
good
sense
and
he
had
a
smiling
way
of
saying
it
once
or
twice
he
ran
counter
to
moellendorff
and
i
could
see
there
was
no
love
lost
between
these
two
i
did
think
i
wanted
him
as
a
friend
he
was
too
and
artificial
and
i
was
pretty
certain
that
i
did
want
those
steady
black
eyes
as
an
enemy
but
it
was
no
good
denying
his
quality
the
little
fellow
was
all
cold
courage
like
the
fine
polished
blue
steel
of
a
sword
i
fancy
i
was
rather
a
success
at
that
dinner
for
one
thing
i
could
speak
german
and
so
had
a
pull
on
blenkiron
for
another
i
was
in
a
good
temper
and
really
enjoyed
putting
my
back
into
my
part
they
talked
very
stuff
about
what
they
had
done
and
were
going
to
do
and
enver
was
great
on
gallipoli
i
remember
he
said
that
he
could
have
destroyed
the
whole
british
army
if
it
had
been
for
cold
feet
at
which
moellendorff
looked
daggers
they
were
so
bitter
about
britain
and
all
her
works
that
i
gathered
they
were
getting
pretty
panicky
and
that
made
me
as
jolly
as
a
sandboy
i
afraid
i
was
not
free
from
bitterness
myself
on
that
subject
i
said
things
about
my
own
country
that
i
sometimes
wake
in
the
night
and
sweat
to
think
of
gaudian
got
on
to
the
use
of
water
power
in
war
and
that
gave
me
a
chance
my
country
i
said
we
want
to
get
rid
of
a
mountain
we
wash
it
away
there
nothing
on
earth
that
will
stand
against
water
now
speaking
with
all
respect
gentlemen
and
as
an
absolute
novice
in
the
military
art
i
sometimes
ask
why
this
weapon
is
more
used
in
the
present
war
i
have
been
to
any
of
the
fronts
but
studied
them
some
from
maps
and
the
newspapers
take
your
german
position
in
flanders
where
you
got
the
high
ground
if
i
were
a
british
general
i
reckon
i
would
very
soon
make
it
no
sort
of
position
moellendorff
asked
i
wash
it
away
wash
away
the
fourteen
feet
of
soil
down
to
the
stone
there
a
heap
of
coalpits
behind
the
british
front
where
they
could
generate
power
and
i
judge
there
ample
water
supply
from
the
rivers
and
canals
i
guarantee
to
wash
you
away
in
hours
yes
in
spite
of
all
your
big
guns
it
beats
me
why
the
british
have
got
on
to
this
notion
they
used
to
have
some
bright
engineers
enver
was
on
the
point
like
a
knife
far
quicker
than
gaudian
he
me
in
a
way
that
showed
he
knew
how
to
approach
a
technical
subject
though
he
might
have
much
technical
knowledge
he
was
just
giving
me
a
sketch
of
the
flooding
in
mesopotamia
when
an
brought
in
a
chit
which
fetched
him
to
his
feet
have
gossiped
long
enough
he
said
kind
host
i
must
leave
you
gentlemen
all
my
apologies
and
farewells
before
he
left
he
asked
my
name
and
wrote
it
down
is
an
unhealthy
city
for
strangers
mr
hanau
he
said
in
very
good
english
have
some
small
power
of
protecting
a
friend
and
what
i
have
is
at
your
disposal
this
with
the
condescension
of
a
king
promising
his
favour
to
a
subject
the
little
fellow
amused
me
tremendously
and
rather
impressed
me
too
i
said
so
to
gaudian
after
he
had
left
but
that
decent
soul
agree
do
not
love
him
he
said
are
allies
yes
but
friends
no
he
is
no
true
son
of
islam
which
is
a
noble
faith
and
despises
liars
and
boasters
and
betrayers
of
their
salt
that
was
the
verdict
of
one
honest
man
on
this
ruler
in
israel
the
next
night
i
got
another
from
blenkiron
on
a
greater
than
enver
he
had
been
out
alone
and
had
come
back
pretty
late
with
his
face
grey
and
drawn
with
pain
the
food
we
ate
not
at
all
bad
of
its
kind
and
the
cold
east
wind
played
havoc
with
his
dyspepsia
i
can
see
him
yet
boiling
milk
on
a
while
peter
worked
at
a
primus
stove
to
get
him
a
bottle
he
was
using
horrid
language
about
his
inside
god
major
if
i
were
you
with
a
sound
stomach
i
fairly
conquer
the
world
as
it
is
i
got
to
do
my
work
with
half
my
mind
while
the
other
half
is
dwelling
in
my
intestines
i
like
the
child
in
the
bible
that
had
a
fox
gnawing
at
its
vitals
he
got
his
milk
boiling
and
began
to
sip
it
been
to
see
our
pretty
landlady
he
said
sent
for
me
and
i
hobbled
off
with
a
grip
full
of
plans
for
she
mighty
set
on
mesopotamy
about
greenmantle
i
asked
eagerly
no
but
i
have
reached
one
conclusion
i
opine
that
the
hapless
prophet
has
no
sort
of
time
with
that
lady
i
opine
that
he
will
soon
wish
himself
in
paradise
for
if
almighty
god
ever
created
a
female
devil
it
madame
von
einem
he
sipped
a
little
more
milk
with
a
grave
face
is
my
duodenal
dyspepsia
major
it
the
verdict
of
a
ripe
experience
for
i
have
a
cool
and
penetrating
judgement
even
if
i
a
deranged
stomach
and
i
give
it
as
my
considered
conclusion
that
that
woman
mad
and
bad
but
principally
bad
chapter
fourteen
the
lady
of
the
mantilla
since
that
first
night
i
had
never
clapped
eyes
on
sandy
he
had
gone
clean
out
of
the
world
and
blenkiron
and
i
waited
anxiously
for
a
word
of
news
our
own
business
was
in
good
trim
for
we
were
presently
going
east
towards
mesopotamia
but
unless
we
learned
more
about
greenmantle
our
journey
would
be
a
grotesque
failure
and
learn
about
greenmantle
we
could
not
for
nobody
by
word
or
deed
suggested
his
existence
and
it
was
impossible
of
course
for
us
to
ask
questions
our
only
hope
was
sandy
for
what
we
wanted
to
know
was
the
whereabouts
and
his
plans
i
suggested
to
blenkiron
that
we
might
do
more
to
cultivate
frau
von
einem
but
he
shut
his
jaw
like
a
nothing
doing
for
us
in
that
quarter
he
said
the
most
dangerous
woman
on
earth
and
if
she
got
any
kind
of
notion
that
we
were
wise
about
her
pet
schemes
i
reckon
you
and
i
would
very
soon
be
in
the
bosporus
this
was
all
very
well
but
what
was
going
to
happen
if
the
two
of
us
were
bundled
off
to
baghdad
with
instructions
to
wash
away
the
british
our
time
was
getting
pretty
short
and
i
doubted
if
we
could
spin
out
more
than
three
days
more
in
constantinople
i
felt
just
as
i
had
felt
with
stumm
that
last
night
when
i
was
about
to
be
packed
off
to
cairo
and
saw
no
way
of
avoiding
it
even
blenkiron
was
getting
anxious
he
played
patience
incessantly
and
was
disinclined
to
talk
i
tried
to
find
out
something
from
the
servants
but
they
either
knew
nothing
or
would
speak
the
former
i
think
i
kept
my
eyes
lifting
too
as
i
walked
about
the
streets
but
there
was
no
sign
anywhere
of
the
skin
coats
or
the
weird
stringed
instruments
the
whole
company
of
the
rosy
hours
seemed
to
have
melted
into
the
air
and
i
began
to
wonder
if
they
had
ever
existed
anxiety
made
me
restless
and
restlessness
made
me
want
exercise
it
was
no
good
walking
about
the
city
the
weather
had
become
foul
again
and
i
was
sick
of
the
smells
and
the
squalor
and
the
crowds
so
blenkiron
and
i
got
horses
turkish
cavalry
mounts
with
heads
like
trees
and
went
out
through
the
suburbs
into
the
open
country
it
was
a
grey
drizzling
afternoon
with
the
beginnings
of
a
sea
fog
which
hid
the
asiatic
shores
of
the
straits
it
was
easy
to
find
open
ground
for
a
gallop
for
there
were
endless
small
patches
of
cultivation
and
the
gardens
of
country
houses
we
kept
on
the
high
land
above
the
sea
and
when
we
reached
a
bit
of
downland
came
on
squads
of
turkish
soldiers
digging
trenches
whenever
we
let
the
horses
go
we
had
to
pull
up
sharp
for
a
digging
party
or
a
stretch
of
barbed
wire
coils
of
the
beastly
thing
were
lying
loose
everywhere
and
blenkiron
nearly
took
a
nasty
toss
over
one
then
we
were
always
being
stopped
by
sentries
and
having
to
show
our
passes
still
the
ride
did
us
good
and
shook
up
our
livers
and
by
the
time
we
turned
for
home
i
was
feeling
more
like
a
white
man
we
jogged
back
in
the
short
winter
twilight
past
the
wooded
grounds
of
white
villas
held
up
every
few
minutes
by
and
companies
of
soldiers
the
rain
had
come
on
in
real
earnest
and
it
was
two
very
bedraggled
horsemen
that
crawled
along
the
muddy
lanes
as
we
passed
one
villa
shut
in
by
a
high
white
wall
a
pleasant
smell
of
wood
smoke
was
wafted
towards
us
which
made
me
sick
for
the
burning
veld
my
ear
too
caught
the
twanging
of
a
zither
which
somehow
reminded
me
of
the
afternoon
in
kuprasso
i
pulled
up
and
proposed
to
investigate
but
blenkiron
very
testily
declined
are
as
common
here
as
fleas
he
said
do
want
to
be
fossicking
around
somebody
stables
and
find
a
entertaining
his
friends
they
do
like
visitors
in
this
country
and
you
be
asking
for
trouble
if
you
go
inside
those
walls
i
guess
it
some
old
buzzard
harem
buzzard
was
his
own
private
peculiar
name
for
the
turk
for
he
said
he
had
had
as
a
boy
a
natural
history
book
with
a
picture
of
a
bird
called
the
and
could
get
out
of
the
habit
of
applying
it
to
the
ottoman
people
i
was
convinced
so
i
tried
to
mark
down
the
place
it
seemed
to
be
about
three
miles
out
from
the
city
at
the
end
of
a
steep
lane
on
the
inland
side
of
the
hill
coming
from
the
bosporus
i
fancied
somebody
of
distinction
lived
there
for
a
little
farther
on
we
met
a
big
empty
snorting
its
way
up
and
i
had
a
notion
that
the
car
belonged
to
the
walled
villa
next
day
blenkiron
was
in
grievous
trouble
with
his
dyspepsia
about
midday
he
was
compelled
to
lie
down
and
having
nothing
better
to
do
i
had
out
the
horses
again
and
took
peter
with
me
it
was
funny
to
see
peter
in
a
turkish
riding
with
the
long
boer
stirrup
and
the
slouch
of
the
backveld
that
afternoon
was
unfortunate
from
the
start
it
was
not
the
mist
and
drizzle
of
the
day
before
but
a
stiff
northern
gale
which
blew
sheets
of
rain
in
our
faces
and
numbed
our
bridle
hands
we
took
the
same
road
but
pushed
west
of
the
parties
and
got
to
a
shallow
valley
with
a
white
village
among
the
cypresses
beyond
that
there
was
a
very
respectable
road
which
brought
us
to
the
top
of
a
crest
that
in
clear
weather
must
have
given
a
fine
prospect
then
we
turned
our
horses
and
i
shaped
our
course
so
as
to
strike
the
top
of
the
long
lane
that
abutted
on
the
down
i
wanted
to
investigate
the
white
villa
but
we
had
gone
far
on
our
road
back
before
we
got
into
trouble
it
arose
out
of
a
a
yellow
mongrel
brute
that
came
at
us
like
a
thunderbolt
it
took
a
special
fancy
to
peter
and
bit
savagely
at
his
horse
heels
and
sent
it
capering
off
the
road
i
should
have
warned
him
but
i
did
not
realize
what
was
happening
till
too
late
for
peter
being
accustomed
to
mongrels
in
kaffir
kraals
took
a
summary
way
with
the
pest
since
it
despised
his
whip
he
out
with
his
pistol
and
put
a
bullet
through
its
head
the
echoes
of
the
shot
had
scarcely
died
away
when
the
row
began
a
big
fellow
appeared
running
towards
us
shouting
wildly
i
guessed
he
was
the
dog
owner
and
proposed
to
pay
no
attention
but
his
cries
summoned
two
other
fellows
soldiers
by
the
look
of
them
who
closed
in
on
us
unslinging
their
rifles
as
they
ran
my
first
idea
was
to
show
them
our
heels
but
i
had
no
desire
to
be
shot
in
the
back
and
they
looked
like
men
who
would
stop
short
of
shooting
so
we
slowed
down
and
faced
them
they
made
as
a
trio
as
you
would
want
to
avoid
the
shepherd
looked
as
if
he
had
been
dug
up
a
dirty
ruffian
with
matted
hair
and
a
beard
like
a
bird
nest
the
two
soldiers
stood
staring
with
sullen
faces
fingering
their
guns
while
the
other
chap
raved
and
stormed
and
kept
pointing
at
peter
whose
mild
eyes
stared
unwinkingly
at
his
assailant
the
mischief
was
that
neither
of
us
had
a
word
of
turkish
i
tried
german
but
it
had
no
effect
we
sat
looking
at
them
and
they
stood
storming
at
us
and
it
was
fast
getting
dark
once
i
turned
my
horse
round
as
if
to
proceed
and
the
two
soldiers
jumped
in
front
of
me
they
jabbered
among
themselves
and
then
one
said
very
slowly
want
pounds
and
he
held
up
five
fingers
they
evidently
saw
by
the
cut
of
our
jib
that
we
were
germans
be
hanged
if
he
gets
a
penny
i
said
angrily
and
the
conversation
languished
the
situation
was
getting
serious
so
i
spoke
a
word
to
peter
the
soldiers
had
their
rifles
loose
in
their
hands
and
before
they
could
lift
them
we
had
the
pair
covered
with
our
pistols
you
move
i
said
are
dead
they
understood
that
all
right
and
stood
stock
still
while
the
shepherd
stopped
his
raving
and
took
to
muttering
like
a
gramophone
when
the
record
is
finished
your
guns
i
said
sharply
or
we
shoot
the
tone
if
not
the
words
conveyed
my
meaning
still
staring
at
us
they
let
the
rifles
slide
to
the
ground
the
next
second
we
had
forced
our
horses
on
the
top
of
them
and
the
three
were
off
like
rabbits
i
sent
a
shot
over
their
heads
to
encourage
them
peter
dismounted
and
tossed
the
guns
into
a
bit
of
scrub
where
they
would
take
some
finding
this
had
wasted
time
by
now
it
was
getting
very
dark
and
we
had
ridden
a
mile
before
it
was
black
night
it
was
an
annoying
predicament
for
i
had
completely
lost
my
bearings
and
at
the
best
i
had
only
a
foggy
notion
of
the
lie
of
the
land
the
best
plan
seemed
to
be
to
try
and
get
to
the
top
of
a
rise
in
the
hope
of
seeing
the
lights
of
the
city
but
all
the
countryside
was
so
pockety
that
it
was
hard
to
strike
the
right
kind
of
rise
we
had
to
trust
to
peter
instinct
i
asked
him
where
our
line
lay
and
he
sat
very
still
for
a
minute
sniffing
the
air
then
he
pointed
the
direction
it
was
what
i
would
have
taken
myself
but
on
a
point
like
that
he
was
pretty
near
infallible
presently
we
came
to
a
long
slope
which
cheered
me
but
at
the
top
there
was
no
light
visible
anywhere
only
a
black
void
like
the
inside
of
a
shell
as
i
stared
into
the
gloom
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
were
patches
of
deeper
darkness
that
might
be
woods
is
a
house
in
front
of
us
said
peter
i
peered
till
my
eyes
ached
and
saw
nothing
for
heaven
sake
guide
me
to
it
i
said
and
with
peter
in
front
we
set
off
down
the
hill
it
was
a
wild
journey
for
darkness
clung
as
close
to
us
as
a
vest
twice
we
stepped
into
patches
of
bog
and
once
my
horse
saved
himself
by
a
hair
from
going
head
forward
into
a
gravel
pit
we
got
tangled
up
in
strands
of
wire
and
often
found
ourselves
rubbing
our
noses
against
tree
trunks
several
times
i
had
to
get
down
and
make
a
gap
in
barricades
of
loose
stones
but
after
a
ridiculous
amount
of
slipping
and
stumbling
we
finally
struck
what
seemed
the
level
of
a
road
and
a
piece
of
special
darkness
in
front
which
turned
out
to
be
a
high
wall
i
argued
that
all
mortal
walls
had
doors
so
we
set
to
groping
along
it
and
presently
found
a
gap
there
was
an
old
iron
gate
on
broken
hinges
which
we
easily
pushed
open
and
found
ourselves
on
a
back
path
to
some
house
it
was
clearly
disused
for
masses
of
rotting
leaves
covered
it
and
by
the
feel
of
it
underfoot
it
was
we
dismounted
now
leading
our
horses
and
after
about
fifty
yards
the
path
ceased
and
came
out
on
a
carriage
drive
so
at
least
we
guessed
for
the
place
was
as
black
as
pitch
evidently
the
house
could
be
far
off
but
in
which
direction
i
had
a
notion
now
i
did
want
to
be
paying
calls
on
any
turk
at
that
time
of
day
our
job
was
to
find
where
the
road
opened
into
the
lane
for
after
that
our
way
to
constantinople
was
clear
one
side
the
lane
lay
and
the
other
the
house
and
it
did
seem
wise
to
take
the
risk
of
tramping
up
with
horses
to
the
front
door
so
i
told
peter
to
wait
for
me
at
the
end
of
the
while
i
would
prospect
a
bit
i
turned
to
the
right
my
intention
being
if
i
saw
the
light
of
a
house
to
return
and
with
peter
take
the
other
direction
i
walked
like
a
blind
man
in
that
of
darkness
the
road
seemed
well
kept
and
the
soft
wet
gravel
muffled
the
sounds
of
my
feet
great
trees
overhung
it
and
several
times
i
wandered
into
dripping
bushes
and
then
i
stopped
short
in
my
tracks
for
i
heard
the
sound
of
whistling
it
was
quite
close
about
ten
yards
away
and
the
strange
thing
was
that
it
was
a
tune
i
knew
about
the
last
tune
you
would
expect
to
hear
in
this
part
of
the
world
it
was
the
scots
air
the
yowes
to
the
knowes
which
was
a
favourite
of
my
father
the
whistler
must
have
felt
my
presence
for
the
air
suddenly
stopped
in
the
middle
of
a
bar
an
unbounded
curiosity
seized
me
to
know
who
the
fellow
could
be
so
i
started
in
and
finished
it
myself
there
was
silence
for
a
second
and
then
the
unknown
began
again
and
stopped
once
more
i
chipped
in
and
finished
it
then
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
coming
nearer
the
air
in
that
dank
tunnel
was
very
still
and
i
thought
i
heard
a
light
foot
i
think
i
took
a
step
backward
suddenly
there
was
a
flash
of
an
electric
torch
from
a
yard
off
so
quick
that
i
could
see
nothing
of
the
man
who
held
it
then
a
low
voice
spoke
out
of
the
darkness
a
voice
i
knew
well
and
following
it
a
hand
was
laid
on
my
arm
the
devil
are
you
doing
here
dick
it
said
and
there
was
something
like
consternation
in
the
tone
i
told
him
in
a
hectic
sentence
for
i
was
beginning
to
feel
badly
rattled
myself
never
been
in
greater
danger
in
your
life
said
the
voice
god
man
what
brought
you
wandering
here
today
of
all
days
you
can
imagine
that
i
was
pretty
scared
for
sandy
was
the
last
man
to
put
a
case
too
high
and
the
next
second
i
felt
worse
for
he
clutched
my
arm
and
dragged
me
in
a
bound
to
the
side
of
the
road
i
could
see
nothing
but
i
felt
that
his
head
was
screwed
round
and
mine
followed
suit
and
there
a
dozen
yards
off
were
the
acetylene
lights
of
a
big
it
came
along
very
slowly
purring
like
a
great
cat
while
we
pressed
into
the
bushes
the
headlights
seemed
to
spread
a
fan
far
to
either
side
showing
the
full
width
of
the
drive
and
its
borders
and
about
half
the
height
of
the
trees
there
was
a
figure
in
uniform
sitting
beside
the
chauffeur
whom
i
saw
dimly
in
the
reflex
glow
but
the
body
of
the
car
was
dark
it
crept
towards
us
passed
and
my
mind
was
just
getting
easy
again
when
it
stopped
a
switch
was
snapped
within
and
the
limousine
was
brightly
lit
up
inside
i
saw
a
woman
figure
the
servant
had
got
out
and
opened
the
door
and
a
voice
came
from
within
a
clear
soft
voice
speaking
in
some
tongue
i
did
understand
sandy
had
started
forward
at
the
sound
of
it
and
i
followed
him
it
would
never
do
for
me
to
be
caught
skulking
in
the
bushes
i
was
so
dazzled
by
the
suddenness
of
the
glare
that
at
first
i
blinked
and
saw
nothing
then
my
eyes
cleared
and
i
found
myself
looking
at
the
inside
of
a
car
upholstered
in
some
soft
fabric
and
beautifully
finished
off
in
ivory
and
silver
the
woman
who
sat
in
it
had
a
mantilla
of
black
lace
over
her
head
and
shoulders
and
with
one
slender
jewelled
hand
she
kept
its
fold
over
the
greater
part
of
her
face
i
saw
only
a
pair
of
pale
eyes
these
and
the
slim
fingers
i
remember
that
sandy
was
standing
very
upright
with
his
hands
on
his
hips
by
no
means
like
a
servant
in
the
presence
of
his
mistress
he
was
a
fine
figure
of
a
man
at
all
times
but
in
those
wild
clothes
with
his
head
thrown
back
and
his
dark
brows
drawn
below
his
he
looked
like
some
savage
king
out
of
an
older
world
he
was
speaking
turkish
and
glancing
at
me
now
and
then
as
if
angry
and
perplexed
i
took
the
hint
that
he
was
not
supposed
to
know
any
other
tongue
and
that
he
was
asking
who
the
devil
i
might
be
then
they
both
looked
at
me
sandy
with
the
slow
unwinking
stare
of
the
gipsy
the
lady
with
those
curious
beautiful
pale
eyes
they
ran
over
my
clothes
my
my
splashed
boots
my
hat
i
took
off
the
last
and
made
my
best
bow
i
said
have
to
ask
pardon
for
trespassing
in
your
garden
the
fact
is
i
and
my
servant
he
down
the
road
with
the
horses
and
i
guess
you
noticed
him
the
two
of
us
went
for
a
ride
this
afternoon
and
got
good
and
well
lost
we
came
in
by
your
back
gate
and
i
was
prospecting
for
your
front
door
to
find
someone
to
direct
us
when
i
bumped
into
this
who
did
understand
my
talk
american
and
i
here
on
a
big
government
proposition
i
hate
to
trouble
you
but
if
you
send
a
man
to
show
us
how
to
strike
the
city
i
be
very
much
in
your
debt
her
eyes
never
left
my
face
you
come
into
the
car
she
said
in
english
the
house
i
will
give
you
a
servant
to
direct
you
she
drew
in
the
skirts
of
her
fur
cloak
to
make
room
for
me
and
in
my
muddy
boots
and
sopping
clothes
i
took
the
seat
she
pointed
out
she
said
a
word
in
turkish
to
sandy
switched
off
the
light
and
the
car
moved
on
women
had
never
come
much
my
way
and
i
knew
about
as
much
of
their
ways
as
i
knew
about
the
chinese
language
all
my
life
i
had
lived
with
men
only
and
rather
a
rough
crowd
at
that
when
i
made
my
pile
and
came
home
i
looked
to
see
a
little
society
but
i
had
first
the
business
of
the
black
stone
on
my
hands
and
then
the
war
so
my
education
languished
i
had
never
been
in
a
with
a
lady
before
and
i
felt
like
a
fish
on
a
dry
sandbank
the
soft
cushions
and
the
subtle
scents
filled
me
with
acute
uneasiness
i
thinking
now
about
sandy
grave
words
or
about
blenkiron
warning
or
about
my
job
and
the
part
this
woman
must
play
in
it
i
was
thinking
only
that
i
felt
mortally
shy
the
darkness
made
it
worse
i
was
sure
that
my
companion
was
looking
at
me
all
the
time
and
laughing
at
me
for
a
clown
the
car
stopped
and
a
tall
servant
opened
the
door
the
lady
was
over
the
threshold
before
i
was
at
the
step
i
followed
her
heavily
the
wet
squelching
from
my
at
that
moment
i
noticed
that
she
was
very
tall
she
led
me
through
a
long
corridor
to
a
room
where
two
pillars
held
lamps
in
the
shape
of
torches
the
place
was
dark
but
for
their
glow
and
it
was
as
warm
as
a
hothouse
from
invisible
stoves
i
felt
soft
carpets
underfoot
and
on
the
walls
hung
some
tapestry
or
rug
of
an
amazingly
intricate
geometrical
pattern
but
with
every
strand
as
rich
as
jewels
there
between
the
pillars
she
turned
and
faced
me
her
furs
were
thrown
back
and
the
black
mantilla
had
slipped
down
to
her
shoulders
have
heard
of
you
she
said
are
called
richard
hanau
the
american
why
have
you
come
to
this
land
have
a
share
in
the
campaign
i
said
an
engineer
and
i
thought
i
could
help
out
with
some
business
like
mesopotamia
are
on
germany
side
she
asked
yes
i
replied
americans
are
supposed
to
be
nootrals
and
that
means
we
free
to
choose
any
side
we
fancy
i
for
the
kaiser
her
cool
eyes
searched
me
but
not
in
suspicion
i
could
see
she
was
troubling
with
the
question
whether
i
was
speaking
the
truth
she
was
sizing
me
up
as
a
man
i
can
not
describe
that
calm
appraising
look
there
was
no
sex
in
it
nothing
even
of
that
implicit
sympathy
with
which
one
human
being
explores
the
existence
of
another
i
was
a
chattel
a
thing
infinitely
removed
from
intimacy
even
so
i
have
myself
looked
at
a
horse
which
i
thought
of
buying
scanning
his
shoulders
and
hocks
and
paces
even
so
must
the
old
lords
of
constantinople
have
looked
at
the
slaves
which
the
chances
of
war
brought
to
their
markets
assessing
their
usefulness
for
some
task
or
other
with
no
thought
of
a
humanity
common
to
purchased
and
purchaser
and
yet
not
quite
this
woman
eyes
were
weighing
me
not
for
any
special
duty
but
for
my
essential
qualities
i
felt
that
i
was
under
the
scrutiny
of
one
who
was
a
connoisseur
in
human
nature
i
see
i
have
written
that
i
knew
nothing
about
women
but
every
man
has
in
his
bones
a
consciousness
of
sex
i
was
shy
and
perturbed
but
horribly
fascinated
this
slim
woman
poised
exquisitely
like
some
statue
between
the
pillared
lights
with
her
fair
cloud
of
hair
her
long
delicate
face
and
her
pale
bright
eyes
had
the
glamour
of
a
wild
dream
i
hated
her
instinctively
hated
her
intensely
but
i
longed
to
arouse
her
interest
to
be
valued
coldly
by
those
eyes
was
an
offence
to
my
manhood
and
i
felt
antagonism
rising
within
me
i
am
a
strong
fellow
well
set
up
and
rather
above
the
average
height
and
my
irritation
stiffened
me
from
heel
to
crown
i
flung
my
head
back
and
gave
her
cool
glance
for
cool
glance
pride
against
pride
once
i
remember
a
doctor
on
board
ship
who
dabbled
in
hypnotism
told
me
that
i
was
the
most
unsympathetic
person
he
had
ever
struck
he
said
i
was
about
as
good
a
mesmeric
subject
as
table
mountain
suddenly
i
began
to
realize
that
this
woman
was
trying
to
cast
some
spell
over
me
the
eyes
grew
large
and
luminous
and
i
was
conscious
for
just
an
instant
of
some
will
battling
to
subject
mine
i
was
aware
too
in
the
same
moment
of
a
strange
scent
which
recalled
that
wild
hour
in
kuprasso
it
passed
quickly
and
for
a
second
her
eyes
drooped
i
seemed
to
read
in
them
failure
and
yet
a
kind
of
satisfaction
too
as
if
they
had
found
more
in
me
than
they
expected
life
have
you
led
the
soft
voice
was
saying
i
was
able
to
answer
quite
naturally
rather
to
my
surprise
have
been
a
mining
engineer
up
and
down
the
world
have
faced
danger
many
times
have
faced
danger
have
fought
with
men
in
battles
have
fought
in
battles
her
bosom
rose
and
fell
in
a
kind
of
sigh
a
smile
a
very
beautiful
thing
flitted
over
her
face
she
gave
me
her
hand
horses
are
at
the
door
now
she
said
your
servant
is
with
them
one
of
my
people
will
guide
you
to
the
city
she
turned
away
and
passed
out
of
the
circle
of
light
into
the
darkness
beyond
peter
and
i
jogged
home
in
the
rain
with
one
of
sandy
companions
loping
at
our
side
we
did
not
speak
a
word
for
my
thoughts
were
running
like
hounds
on
the
track
of
the
past
hours
i
had
seen
the
mysterious
hilda
von
einem
i
had
spoken
to
her
i
had
held
her
hand
she
had
insulted
me
with
the
subtlest
of
insults
and
yet
i
was
not
angry
suddenly
the
game
i
was
playing
became
invested
with
a
tremendous
solemnity
my
old
antagonists
stumm
and
rasta
and
the
whole
german
empire
seemed
to
shrink
into
the
background
leaving
only
the
slim
woman
with
her
inscrutable
smile
and
devouring
eyes
and
bad
blenkiron
had
called
her
principally
bad
i
did
not
think
they
were
the
proper
terms
for
they
belonged
to
the
narrow
world
of
our
common
experience
this
was
something
beyond
and
above
it
as
a
cyclone
or
an
earthquake
is
outside
the
decent
routine
of
nature
mad
and
bad
she
might
be
but
she
was
also
great
before
we
arrived
our
guide
had
plucked
my
knee
and
spoken
some
words
which
he
had
obviously
got
by
heart
master
says
ran
the
message
him
at
midnight
chapter
fifteen
an
embarrassed
toilet
i
was
soaked
to
the
bone
and
while
peter
set
off
to
look
for
dinner
i
went
to
my
room
to
change
i
had
a
rubdown
and
then
got
into
pyjamas
for
some
exercises
with
two
chairs
for
that
long
wet
ride
had
stiffened
my
arm
and
shoulder
muscles
they
were
a
vulgar
suit
of
primitive
blue
which
blenkiron
had
looted
from
my
london
wardrobe
as
cornelis
brandt
i
had
sported
a
flannel
nightgown
my
bedroom
opened
off
the
and
while
i
was
busy
with
my
gymnastics
i
heard
the
door
open
i
thought
at
first
it
was
blenkiron
but
the
briskness
of
the
tread
was
unlike
his
measured
gait
i
had
left
the
light
burning
there
and
the
visitor
whoever
he
was
had
made
himself
at
home
i
slipped
on
a
green
blenkiron
had
lent
me
and
sallied
forth
to
investigate
my
friend
rasta
was
standing
by
the
table
on
which
he
had
laid
an
envelope
he
looked
round
at
my
entrance
and
saluted
come
from
the
minister
of
war
sir
he
said
bring
you
your
passports
for
tomorrow
you
will
travel
by
and
then
his
voice
tailed
away
and
his
black
eyes
narrowed
to
slits
he
had
seen
something
which
switched
him
off
the
metals
at
that
moment
i
saw
it
too
there
was
a
mirror
on
the
wall
behind
him
and
as
i
faced
him
i
could
not
help
seeing
my
reflection
it
was
the
exact
image
of
the
engineer
on
the
danube
boat
blue
jeans
cloak
and
all
the
accursed
mischance
of
my
costume
had
given
him
the
clue
to
an
identity
which
was
otherwise
buried
deep
in
the
bosporus
i
am
bound
to
say
for
rasta
that
he
was
a
man
of
quick
action
in
a
trice
he
had
whipped
round
to
the
other
side
of
the
table
between
me
and
the
door
where
he
stood
regarding
me
wickedly
by
this
time
i
was
at
the
table
and
stretched
out
a
hand
for
the
envelope
my
one
hope
was
nonchalance
down
sir
i
said
have
a
drink
it
a
filthy
night
to
move
about
in
you
no
herr
brandt
he
said
may
burn
these
passports
for
they
will
not
be
used
the
matter
with
you
i
cried
mistaken
the
house
my
lad
i
called
hanau
richard
hanau
and
my
partner
mr
john
blenkiron
he
be
here
presently
never
knew
anyone
of
the
name
of
brandt
barring
a
tobacconist
in
denver
city
have
never
been
to
rustchuk
he
said
with
a
sneer
that
i
know
of
but
pardon
me
sir
if
i
ask
your
name
and
your
business
here
i
darned
if
i
accustomed
to
be
called
by
dutch
names
or
have
my
word
doubted
in
my
country
we
consider
that
impolite
as
between
gentlemen
i
could
see
that
my
bluff
was
having
its
effect
his
stare
began
to
waver
and
when
he
next
spoke
it
was
in
a
more
civil
tone
will
ask
pardon
if
i
mistaken
sir
but
you
the
image
of
a
man
who
a
week
ago
was
at
rustchuk
a
man
much
wanted
by
the
imperial
government
week
ago
i
was
tossing
in
a
dirty
little
hooker
coming
from
constanza
unless
rustchuk
in
the
middle
of
the
black
sea
i
never
visited
the
township
i
guess
you
barking
up
the
wrong
tree
come
to
think
of
it
i
was
expecting
passports
say
do
you
come
from
enver
damad
have
that
honour
he
said
enver
is
a
very
good
friend
of
mine
he
the
brightest
citizen
i
struck
this
side
of
the
atlantic
the
man
was
calming
down
and
in
another
minute
his
suspicions
would
have
gone
but
at
that
moment
by
the
crookedest
kind
of
luck
peter
entered
with
a
tray
of
dishes
he
did
not
notice
rasta
and
walked
straight
to
the
table
and
plumped
down
his
burden
on
it
the
turk
had
stepped
aside
at
his
entrance
and
i
saw
by
the
look
in
his
eyes
that
his
suspicions
had
become
a
certainty
for
peter
stripped
to
shirt
and
breeches
was
the
identical
shabby
little
companion
of
the
rustchuk
meeting
i
had
never
doubted
rasta
pluck
he
jumped
for
the
door
and
had
a
pistol
out
in
a
trice
pointing
at
my
head
he
cried
the
birds
at
one
shot
his
hand
was
on
the
latch
and
his
mouth
was
open
to
cry
i
guessed
there
was
an
orderly
waiting
on
the
stairs
he
had
what
you
call
the
strategic
advantage
for
he
was
at
the
door
while
i
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
and
peter
at
the
side
of
it
at
least
two
yards
from
him
the
road
was
clear
before
him
and
neither
of
us
was
armed
i
made
a
despairing
step
forward
not
knowing
what
i
meant
to
do
for
i
saw
no
light
but
peter
was
before
me
he
had
never
let
go
of
the
tray
and
now
as
a
boy
skims
a
stone
on
a
pond
he
skimmed
it
with
its
contents
at
rasta
head
the
man
was
opening
the
door
with
one
hand
while
he
kept
me
covered
with
the
other
and
he
got
the
contrivance
fairly
in
the
face
a
pistol
shot
cracked
out
and
the
bullet
went
through
the
tray
but
the
noise
was
drowned
in
the
crash
of
glasses
and
crockery
the
next
second
peter
had
wrenched
the
pistol
from
rasta
hand
and
had
gripped
his
throat
a
dandified
young
turk
brought
up
in
paris
and
finished
in
berlin
may
be
as
brave
as
a
lion
but
he
can
not
stand
in
a
against
a
backveld
hunter
though
more
than
double
his
age
there
was
no
need
for
me
to
help
him
peter
had
his
own
way
learned
in
a
wild
school
of
knocking
the
sense
out
of
a
foe
he
gagged
him
scientifically
and
trussed
him
up
with
his
own
belt
and
two
straps
from
a
trunk
in
my
bedroom
man
is
too
dangerous
to
let
go
he
said
as
if
his
procedure
were
the
most
ordinary
thing
in
the
world
will
be
quiet
now
till
we
have
time
to
make
a
plan
at
that
moment
there
came
a
knocking
at
the
door
that
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
happens
in
melodrama
just
when
the
villain
has
finished
off
his
job
neatly
the
correct
thing
to
do
is
to
pale
to
the
teeth
and
with
a
rolling
eye
glare
round
the
horizon
but
that
was
not
peter
way
better
tidy
up
if
we
to
have
visitors
he
said
calmly
now
there
was
one
of
those
big
oak
german
cupboards
against
the
wall
which
must
have
been
brought
in
in
sections
for
complete
it
would
never
have
got
through
the
door
it
was
empty
now
but
for
hatbox
in
it
he
deposited
the
unconscious
rasta
and
turned
the
key
enough
ventilation
through
the
top
he
observed
keep
the
air
good
then
he
opened
the
door
a
magnificent
kavass
in
blue
and
silver
stood
outside
he
saluted
and
proffered
a
card
on
which
was
written
in
pencil
von
einem
i
would
have
begged
for
time
to
change
my
clothes
but
the
lady
was
behind
him
i
saw
the
black
mantilla
and
the
rich
sable
furs
peter
vanished
through
my
bedroom
and
i
was
left
to
receive
my
guest
in
a
room
littered
with
broken
glass
and
a
senseless
man
in
the
cupboard
there
are
some
situations
so
crazily
extravagant
that
they
key
up
the
spirit
to
meet
them
i
was
almost
laughing
when
that
stately
lady
stepped
over
my
threshold
i
said
with
a
bow
that
shamed
my
old
and
strident
pyjamas
find
me
at
a
disadvantage
i
came
home
soaking
from
my
ride
and
was
in
the
act
of
changing
my
servant
has
just
upset
a
tray
of
crockery
and
i
fear
this
room
no
fit
place
for
a
lady
allow
me
three
minutes
to
make
myself
presentable
she
inclined
her
head
gravely
and
took
a
seat
by
the
fire
i
went
into
my
bedroom
and
as
i
expected
found
peter
lurking
by
the
other
door
in
a
hectic
sentence
i
bade
him
get
rasta
orderly
out
of
the
place
on
any
pretext
and
tell
him
his
master
would
return
later
then
i
hurried
into
decent
garments
and
came
out
to
find
my
visitor
in
a
brown
study
at
the
sound
of
my
entrance
she
started
from
her
dream
and
stood
up
on
the
hearthrug
slipping
the
long
robe
of
fur
from
her
slim
body
are
alone
she
said
will
not
be
disturbed
then
an
inspiration
came
to
me
i
remembered
that
frau
von
einem
according
to
blenkiron
did
not
see
eye
to
eye
with
the
young
turks
and
i
had
a
queer
instinct
that
rasta
could
not
be
to
her
liking
so
i
spoke
the
truth
must
tell
you
that
there
another
guest
here
tonight
i
reckon
he
feeling
pretty
uncomfortable
at
present
he
trussed
up
on
a
shelf
in
that
cupboard
she
did
not
trouble
to
look
round
he
dead
she
asked
calmly
no
means
i
said
he
fixed
so
he
ca
speak
and
i
guess
he
ca
hear
much
was
the
man
who
brought
you
this
she
asked
pointing
to
the
envelope
on
the
table
which
bore
the
big
blue
stamp
of
the
ministry
of
war
same
i
said
not
perfectly
sure
of
his
name
but
i
think
they
call
him
rasta
not
a
flicker
of
a
smile
crossed
her
face
but
i
had
a
feeling
that
the
news
pleased
her
he
thwart
you
she
asked
yes
he
thwarted
me
some
his
head
is
a
bit
swelled
and
an
hour
or
two
on
the
shelf
will
do
him
good
is
a
powerful
man
she
said
jackal
of
enver
you
have
made
a
dangerous
enemy
do
value
him
at
two
cents
said
i
though
i
thought
grimly
that
as
far
as
i
could
see
the
value
of
him
was
likely
to
be
about
the
price
of
my
neck
you
are
right
she
said
with
serious
eyes
these
days
no
enemy
is
dangerous
to
a
bold
man
i
have
come
tonight
mr
hanau
to
talk
business
with
you
as
they
say
in
your
country
i
have
heard
well
of
you
and
today
i
have
seen
you
i
may
have
need
of
you
and
you
assuredly
will
have
need
of
me
she
broke
off
and
again
her
strange
potent
eyes
fell
on
my
face
they
were
like
a
burning
searchlight
which
showed
up
every
cranny
and
crack
of
the
soul
i
felt
it
was
going
to
be
horribly
difficult
to
act
a
part
under
that
compelling
gaze
she
could
not
mesmerize
me
but
she
could
strip
me
of
my
fancy
dress
and
set
me
naked
in
the
masquerade
came
you
forth
to
seek
she
asked
are
not
like
the
stout
american
blenkiron
a
lover
of
shoddy
power
and
a
devotee
of
a
feeble
science
there
is
something
more
than
that
in
your
face
you
are
on
our
side
but
you
are
not
of
the
germans
with
their
hankerings
for
a
rococo
empire
you
come
from
america
the
land
of
pious
follies
where
men
worship
gold
and
words
i
ask
what
came
you
forth
to
seek
as
she
spoke
i
seemed
to
get
a
vision
of
a
figure
like
one
of
the
old
gods
looking
down
on
human
nature
from
a
great
height
a
figure
disdainful
and
passionless
but
with
its
own
magnificence
it
kindled
my
imagination
and
i
answered
with
the
stuff
i
had
often
cogitated
when
i
had
tried
to
explain
to
myself
just
how
a
case
could
be
made
out
against
the
allied
cause
will
tell
you
madam
i
said
am
a
man
who
has
followed
a
science
but
i
have
followed
it
in
wild
places
and
i
have
gone
through
it
and
come
out
at
the
other
side
the
world
as
i
see
it
had
become
too
easy
and
cushioned
men
had
forgotten
their
manhood
in
soft
speech
and
imagined
that
the
rules
of
their
smug
civilization
were
the
laws
of
the
universe
but
that
is
not
the
teaching
of
science
and
it
is
not
the
teaching
of
life
we
have
forgotten
the
greater
virtues
and
we
were
becoming
emasculated
humbugs
whose
gods
were
our
own
weaknesses
then
came
war
and
the
air
was
cleared
germany
in
spite
of
her
blunders
and
her
grossness
stood
forth
as
the
scourge
of
cant
she
had
the
courage
to
cut
through
the
bonds
of
humbug
and
to
laugh
at
the
fetishes
of
the
herd
therefore
i
am
on
germany
side
but
i
came
here
for
another
reason
i
know
nothing
of
the
east
but
as
i
read
history
it
is
from
the
desert
that
the
purification
comes
when
mankind
is
smothered
with
shams
and
phrases
and
painted
idols
a
wind
blows
out
of
the
wild
to
cleanse
and
simplify
life
the
world
needs
space
and
fresh
air
the
civilization
we
have
boasted
of
is
a
and
a
blind
alley
and
i
hanker
for
the
open
country
this
confounded
nonsense
was
well
received
her
pale
eyes
had
the
cold
light
of
the
fanatic
with
her
bright
hair
and
the
long
exquisite
oval
of
her
face
she
looked
like
some
destroying
fury
of
a
norse
legend
at
that
moment
i
think
i
first
really
feared
her
before
i
had
and
thank
heaven
in
her
absorption
she
did
not
notice
that
i
had
forgotten
the
speech
of
cleveland
ohio
are
of
the
household
of
faith
she
said
will
presently
learn
many
things
for
the
faith
marches
to
victory
meantime
i
have
one
word
for
you
you
and
your
companion
travel
eastward
go
to
mesopotamia
i
said
reckon
these
are
our
passports
and
i
pointed
to
the
envelope
she
picked
it
up
opened
it
and
then
tore
it
in
pieces
and
tossed
it
in
the
fire
orders
are
countermanded
she
said
have
need
of
you
and
you
go
with
me
not
to
the
flats
of
the
tigris
but
to
the
great
hills
tomorrow
you
will
receive
new
passports
she
gave
me
her
hand
and
turned
to
go
at
the
threshold
she
paused
and
looked
towards
the
oak
cupboard
i
will
relieve
you
of
your
prisoner
he
will
be
safer
in
my
hands
she
left
me
in
a
condition
of
pretty
blank
bewilderment
we
were
to
be
tied
to
the
of
this
fury
and
started
on
an
enterprise
compared
to
which
fighting
against
our
friends
at
kut
seemed
tame
and
reasonable
on
the
other
hand
i
had
been
spotted
by
rasta
and
had
got
the
envoy
of
the
most
powerful
man
in
constantinople
locked
in
a
cupboard
at
all
costs
we
had
to
keep
rasta
safe
but
i
was
very
determined
that
he
should
not
be
handed
over
to
the
lady
i
was
going
to
be
no
party
to
murder
which
i
judged
to
be
her
expedient
it
was
a
pretty
kettle
of
fish
but
in
the
meantime
i
must
have
food
for
i
had
eaten
nothing
for
nine
hours
so
i
went
in
search
of
peter
i
had
scarcely
begun
my
long
deferred
meal
when
sandy
entered
he
was
before
his
time
and
he
looked
as
solemn
as
a
sick
owl
i
seized
on
him
as
a
drowning
man
clutches
a
spar
he
heard
my
story
of
rasta
with
a
lengthening
face
bad
he
said
say
he
spotted
you
and
your
subsequent
doings
of
course
would
not
disillusion
him
it
an
infernal
nuisance
but
there
only
one
way
out
of
it
i
must
put
him
in
charge
of
my
own
people
they
will
keep
him
safe
and
sound
till
he
wanted
only
he
must
see
me
and
he
went
out
in
a
hurry
i
fetched
rasta
from
his
prison
he
had
come
to
his
senses
by
this
time
and
lay
regarding
me
with
stony
malevolent
eyes
very
sorry
sir
i
said
what
has
happened
but
you
left
me
no
alternative
i
got
a
big
job
on
hand
and
i
ca
have
it
interfered
with
by
you
or
anyone
you
paying
the
price
of
a
suspicious
nature
when
you
know
a
little
more
you
want
to
apologize
to
me
i
going
to
see
that
you
are
kept
quiet
and
comfortable
for
a
day
or
two
you
no
cause
to
worry
for
suffer
no
harm
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
as
an
american
citizen
two
of
sandy
miscreants
came
in
and
bore
him
off
and
presently
sandy
himself
returned
when
i
asked
him
where
he
was
being
taken
sandy
said
he
did
know
got
their
orders
and
they
carry
them
out
to
the
letter
there
a
big
unknown
area
in
constantinople
to
hide
a
man
into
which
the
never
enter
then
he
flung
himself
in
a
chair
and
lit
his
old
pipe
he
said
job
is
getting
very
difficult
and
very
dark
but
my
knowledge
has
grown
in
the
last
few
days
i
found
out
the
meaning
of
the
second
word
that
harry
bullivant
scribbled
i
asked
it
means
just
what
it
reads
and
no
more
greenmantle
is
dying
has
been
dying
for
months
this
afternoon
they
brought
a
german
doctor
to
see
him
and
the
man
gave
him
a
few
hours
of
life
by
now
he
may
be
dead
the
news
was
a
staggerer
for
a
moment
i
thought
it
cleared
up
things
that
busts
the
show
i
said
ca
have
a
crusade
without
a
prophet
wish
i
thought
it
did
it
the
end
of
one
stage
but
the
start
of
a
new
and
blacker
one
do
you
think
that
woman
will
be
beaten
by
such
a
small
thing
as
the
death
of
her
prophet
she
find
a
substitute
one
of
the
four
ministers
or
someone
else
she
a
devil
incarnate
but
she
has
the
soul
of
a
napoleon
the
big
danger
is
only
beginning
then
he
told
me
the
story
of
his
recent
doings
he
had
found
out
the
house
of
frau
von
einem
without
much
trouble
and
had
performed
with
his
ragamuffins
in
the
servants
quarters
the
prophet
had
a
large
retinue
and
the
fame
of
his
minstrels
for
the
companions
were
known
far
and
wide
in
the
land
of
islam
came
speedily
to
the
ears
of
the
holy
ones
sandy
a
leader
in
this
most
orthodox
coterie
was
taken
into
favour
and
brought
to
the
notice
of
the
four
ministers
he
and
his
retainers
became
inmates
of
the
villa
and
sandy
from
his
knowledge
of
islamic
lore
and
his
ostentatious
piety
was
admitted
to
the
confidence
of
the
household
frau
von
einem
welcomed
him
as
an
ally
for
the
companions
had
been
the
most
devoted
propagandists
of
the
new
revelation
as
he
described
it
it
was
a
strange
business
greenmantle
was
dying
and
often
in
great
pain
but
he
struggled
to
meet
the
demands
of
his
protectress
the
four
ministers
as
sandy
saw
them
were
unworldly
ascetics
the
prophet
himself
was
a
saint
though
a
practical
saint
with
some
notions
of
policy
but
the
controlling
brain
and
will
were
those
of
the
lady
sandy
seemed
to
have
won
his
favour
even
his
affection
he
spoke
of
him
with
a
kind
of
desperate
pity
never
saw
such
a
man
he
is
the
greatest
gentleman
you
can
picture
with
a
dignity
like
a
high
mountain
he
is
a
dreamer
and
a
poet
too
a
genius
if
i
can
judge
these
things
i
think
i
can
assess
him
rightly
for
i
know
something
of
the
soul
of
the
east
but
it
would
be
too
long
a
story
to
tell
now
the
west
knows
nothing
of
the
true
oriental
it
pictures
him
as
lapped
in
colour
and
idleness
and
luxury
and
gorgeous
dreams
but
it
is
all
wrong
the
he
yearns
for
is
an
austere
thing
it
is
the
austerity
of
the
east
that
is
its
beauty
and
its
terror
it
always
wants
the
same
things
at
the
back
of
its
head
the
turk
and
the
arab
came
out
of
big
spaces
and
they
have
the
desire
of
them
in
their
bones
they
settle
down
and
stagnate
and
by
the
by
they
degenerate
into
that
appalling
subtlety
which
is
their
ruling
passion
gone
crooked
and
then
comes
a
new
revelation
and
a
great
simplifying
they
want
to
live
face
to
face
with
god
without
a
screen
of
ritual
and
images
and
priestcraft
they
want
to
prune
life
of
its
foolish
fringes
and
get
back
to
the
noble
bareness
of
the
desert
remember
it
is
always
the
empty
desert
and
the
empty
sky
that
cast
their
spell
over
them
these
and
the
hot
strong
antiseptic
sunlight
which
burns
up
all
rot
and
decay
it
is
inhuman
it
the
humanity
of
one
part
of
the
human
race
it
is
ours
it
is
as
good
as
ours
but
it
jolly
good
all
the
same
there
are
times
when
it
grips
me
so
hard
that
i
inclined
to
forswear
the
gods
of
my
fathers
greenmantle
is
the
prophet
of
this
great
simplicity
he
speaks
straight
to
the
heart
of
islam
and
it
an
honourable
message
but
for
our
sins
it
been
twisted
into
part
of
that
damned
german
propaganda
his
unworldliness
has
been
used
for
a
cunning
political
move
and
his
creed
of
space
and
simplicity
for
the
furtherance
of
the
last
word
in
human
degeneracy
my
god
dick
it
like
seeing
st
francis
run
by
messalina
woman
has
been
here
tonight
i
said
asked
me
what
i
stood
for
and
i
invented
some
infernal
nonsense
which
she
approved
of
but
i
can
see
one
thing
she
and
her
prophet
may
run
for
different
stakes
but
it
the
same
course
sandy
started
has
been
here
he
cried
me
dick
what
do
you
think
of
her
thought
she
was
about
two
parts
mad
but
the
third
part
was
uncommon
like
inspiration
about
right
he
said
was
wrong
in
comparing
her
to
messalina
she
something
a
dashed
sight
more
complicated
she
runs
the
prophet
just
because
she
shares
his
belief
only
what
in
him
is
sane
and
fine
in
her
is
mad
and
horrible
you
see
germany
also
wants
to
simplify
life
know
i
said
told
her
that
an
hour
ago
when
i
talked
more
rot
to
the
second
than
any
normal
man
ever
achieved
it
will
come
between
me
and
my
sleep
for
the
rest
of
my
days
simplicity
is
that
of
the
neurotic
not
the
primitive
it
is
megalomania
and
egotism
and
the
pride
of
the
man
in
the
bible
that
waxed
fat
and
kicked
but
the
results
are
the
same
she
wants
to
destroy
and
simplify
but
it
is
the
simplicity
of
the
ascetic
which
is
of
the
spirit
but
the
simplicity
of
the
madman
that
grinds
down
all
the
contrivances
of
civilization
to
a
featureless
monotony
the
prophet
wants
to
save
the
souls
of
his
people
germany
wants
to
rule
the
inanimate
corpse
of
the
world
but
you
can
get
the
same
language
to
cover
both
and
so
you
have
the
partnership
of
st
francis
and
messalina
dick
did
you
ever
hear
of
a
thing
called
the
superman
was
a
time
when
the
papers
were
full
of
nothing
else
i
answered
gather
it
was
invented
by
a
sportsman
called
nietzsche
said
sandy
nietzsche
has
been
blamed
for
a
great
deal
of
rubbish
he
would
have
died
rather
than
acknowledge
but
it
a
craze
of
the
new
fatted
germany
it
a
fancy
type
which
could
never
really
exist
any
more
than
the
economic
man
of
the
politicians
mankind
has
a
sense
of
humour
which
stops
short
of
the
final
absurdity
there
never
has
been
and
there
never
could
be
a
real
superman
but
there
might
be
a
superwoman
get
into
trouble
my
lad
if
you
talk
like
that
i
said
true
all
the
same
women
have
got
a
perilous
logic
which
we
never
have
and
some
of
the
best
of
them
do
see
the
joke
of
life
like
the
ordinary
man
they
can
be
far
greater
than
men
for
they
can
go
straight
to
the
heart
of
things
there
never
was
a
man
so
near
the
divine
as
joan
of
arc
but
i
think
too
they
can
be
more
entirely
damnable
than
anything
that
ever
was
breeched
for
they
do
stop
still
now
and
then
and
laugh
at
themselves
there
is
no
superman
the
poor
old
donkeys
that
fancy
themselves
in
the
part
are
either
crackbrained
professors
who
could
rule
a
class
or
bristling
soldiers
with
heads
who
imagine
that
the
shooting
of
a
duc
made
a
napoleon
but
there
is
a
superwoman
and
her
name
hilda
von
einem
thought
our
job
was
nearly
over
i
groaned
now
it
looks
as
if
it
had
well
started
bullivant
said
that
all
we
had
to
do
was
to
find
out
the
truth
did
know
no
man
knows
except
you
and
me
i
tell
you
the
woman
has
immense
power
the
germans
have
trusted
her
with
their
trump
card
and
she
going
to
play
it
for
all
she
is
worth
no
crime
that
will
stand
in
her
way
she
has
set
the
ball
rolling
and
if
need
be
she
cut
all
her
prophets
throats
and
run
the
show
herself
i
do
know
about
your
job
for
honestly
i
ca
quite
see
what
you
and
blenkiron
are
going
to
do
but
i
very
clear
about
my
own
duty
she
let
me
into
the
business
and
i
going
to
stick
to
it
in
the
hope
that
i
find
a
chance
of
wrecking
it
we
moving
eastward
tomorrow
with
a
new
prophet
if
the
old
one
is
dead
are
you
going
i
asked
do
know
but
i
gather
it
a
long
journey
judging
by
the
preparations
and
it
must
be
to
a
cold
country
judging
by
the
clothes
provided
wherever
it
is
we
going
with
you
you
have
heard
the
end
of
our
yarn
blenkiron
and
i
have
been
moving
in
the
best
circles
as
skilled
american
engineers
who
are
going
to
play
old
harry
with
the
british
on
the
tigris
i
a
pal
of
enver
now
and
he
has
offered
me
his
protection
the
lamented
rasta
brought
our
passports
for
the
journey
to
mesopotamia
tomorrow
but
an
hour
ago
your
lady
tore
them
up
and
put
them
in
the
fire
we
are
going
with
her
and
she
vouchsafed
the
information
that
it
was
towards
the
great
hills
sandy
whistled
long
and
low
wonder
what
the
deuce
she
wants
with
you
this
thing
is
getting
dashed
complicated
dick
where
more
by
token
is
blenkiron
he
the
fellow
to
know
about
high
politics
the
missing
blenkiron
as
sandy
spoke
entered
the
room
with
his
slow
quiet
step
i
could
see
by
his
carriage
that
for
once
he
had
no
dyspepsia
and
by
his
eyes
that
he
was
excited
boys
he
said
got
something
pretty
considerable
in
the
way
of
noos
there
been
big
fighting
on
the
eastern
border
and
the
buzzards
have
taken
a
bad
knock
his
hands
were
full
of
papers
from
which
he
selected
a
map
and
spread
it
on
the
table
keep
mum
about
this
thing
in
the
capital
but
i
been
piecing
the
story
together
these
last
days
and
i
think
i
got
it
straight
a
fortnight
ago
old
man
nicholas
descended
from
his
mountains
and
scuppered
his
enemies
there
at
kuprikeui
where
the
main
road
eastwards
crosses
the
araxes
that
was
only
the
beginning
of
the
stunt
for
he
pressed
on
on
a
broad
front
and
the
gentleman
called
kiamil
who
commands
in
those
parts
was
not
up
to
the
job
of
holding
him
the
buzzards
were
shepherded
in
from
north
and
east
and
south
and
now
the
muscovite
is
sitting
down
outside
the
forts
of
erzerum
i
can
tell
you
they
pretty
miserable
about
the
situation
in
the
highest
quarters
enver
is
sweating
blood
to
get
fresh
divisions
to
erzerum
from
but
it
a
long
road
and
it
looks
as
if
they
would
be
too
late
for
the
fair
you
and
i
major
start
for
mesopotamy
tomorrow
and
that
about
the
meanest
bit
of
bad
luck
that
ever
happened
to
john
we
missing
the
chance
of
seeing
the
goriest
fight
of
this
campaign
i
picked
up
the
map
and
pocketed
it
maps
were
my
business
and
i
had
been
looking
for
one
not
going
to
mesopotamia
i
said
orders
have
been
cancelled
i
just
seen
enver
and
he
said
he
had
sent
round
our
passports
in
the
fire
i
said
right
ones
will
come
along
tomorrow
morning
sandy
broke
in
his
eyes
bright
with
excitement
great
hills
we
going
to
erzerum
do
you
see
that
the
germans
are
playing
their
big
card
they
sending
greenmantle
to
the
point
of
danger
in
the
hope
that
his
coming
will
rally
the
turkish
defence
things
are
beginning
to
move
dick
old
man
no
more
kicking
the
heels
for
us
we
going
to
be
in
it
up
to
the
neck
and
heaven
help
the
best
man
i
must
be
off
now
for
i
a
lot
to
do
we
meet
some
time
in
the
hills
blenkiron
still
looked
puzzled
till
i
told
him
the
story
of
that
night
doings
as
he
listened
all
the
satisfaction
went
out
of
his
face
and
that
funny
childish
air
of
bewilderment
crept
in
not
for
me
to
complain
for
it
in
the
straight
line
of
our
dooty
but
i
reckon
there
going
to
be
big
trouble
ahead
of
this
caravan
it
kismet
and
we
got
to
bow
but
i
wo
pretend
that
i
not
considerable
scared
at
the
prospect
so
am
i
i
said
woman
frightens
me
into
fits
we
up
against
it
this
time
all
right
all
the
same
i
glad
we
to
be
let
into
the
real
star
metropolitan
performance
i
did
relish
the
idea
of
touring
the
provinces
guess
that
correct
but
i
could
wish
that
the
good
god
would
see
fit
to
take
that
lovely
lady
to
himself
she
too
much
for
a
quiet
man
at
my
time
of
life
when
she
invites
us
to
go
in
on
the
i
feel
like
taking
the
elevator
to
the
chapter
sixteen
the
battered
caravanserai
two
days
later
in
the
evening
we
came
to
angora
the
first
stage
in
our
journey
the
passports
had
arrived
next
morning
as
frau
von
einem
had
promised
and
with
them
a
plan
of
our
journey
more
one
of
the
companions
who
spoke
a
little
english
was
detailed
to
accompany
us
a
wise
precaution
for
no
one
of
us
had
a
word
of
turkish
these
were
the
sum
of
our
instructions
i
heard
nothing
more
of
sandy
or
greenmantle
or
the
lady
we
were
meant
to
travel
in
our
own
party
we
had
the
railway
to
angora
a
very
comfortable
german
tacked
to
the
end
of
a
there
was
much
to
be
seen
of
the
country
for
after
we
left
the
bosporus
we
ran
into
scuds
of
snow
and
except
that
we
seemed
to
be
climbing
on
to
a
big
plateau
i
had
no
notion
of
the
landscape
it
was
a
marvel
that
we
made
such
good
time
for
that
line
was
congested
beyond
anything
i
have
ever
seen
the
place
was
crawling
with
the
gallipoli
troops
and
every
siding
was
packed
with
supply
trucks
when
we
stopped
which
we
did
on
an
average
about
once
an
hour
you
could
see
vast
camps
on
both
sides
of
the
line
and
often
we
struck
regiments
on
the
march
along
the
railway
track
they
looked
a
fine
hardy
lot
of
ruffians
but
many
were
deplorably
ragged
and
i
did
think
much
of
their
boots
i
wondered
how
they
would
do
the
five
hundred
miles
of
road
to
erzerum
blenkiron
played
patience
and
peter
and
i
took
a
hand
at
picquet
but
mostly
we
smoked
and
yarned
getting
away
from
that
infernal
city
had
cheered
us
up
wonderfully
now
we
were
out
on
the
open
road
moving
to
the
sound
of
the
guns
at
the
worst
we
should
not
perish
like
rats
in
a
sewer
we
would
be
all
together
too
and
that
was
a
comfort
i
think
we
felt
the
relief
which
a
man
who
has
been
on
a
lonely
outpost
feels
when
he
is
brought
back
to
his
battalion
besides
the
thing
had
gone
clean
beyond
our
power
to
direct
it
was
no
good
planning
and
scheming
for
none
of
us
had
a
notion
what
the
next
step
might
be
we
were
fatalists
now
believing
in
kismet
and
that
is
a
comfortable
faith
all
but
blenkiron
the
coming
of
hilda
von
einem
into
the
business
had
put
a
very
ugly
complexion
on
it
for
him
it
was
curious
to
see
how
she
affected
the
different
members
of
our
gang
peter
did
not
care
a
rush
man
woman
and
hippogriff
were
the
same
to
him
he
met
it
all
as
calmly
as
if
he
were
making
plans
to
round
up
an
old
lion
in
a
patch
of
bush
taking
the
facts
as
they
came
and
working
at
them
as
if
they
were
a
sum
in
arithmetic
sandy
and
i
were
impressed
it
no
good
denying
it
horribly
impressed
but
we
were
too
interested
to
be
scared
and
we
were
a
bit
fascinated
we
hated
her
too
much
for
that
but
she
fairly
struck
blenkiron
dumb
he
said
himself
it
was
just
like
a
rattlesnake
and
a
bird
i
made
him
talk
about
her
for
if
he
sat
and
brooded
he
would
get
worse
it
was
a
strange
thing
that
this
man
the
most
imperturbable
and
i
think
about
the
most
courageous
i
have
ever
met
should
be
paralysed
by
a
slim
woman
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
the
thought
of
her
made
the
future
to
him
as
black
as
a
thunder
cloud
it
took
the
power
out
of
his
joints
and
if
she
was
going
to
be
much
around
it
looked
as
if
blenkiron
might
be
counted
out
i
suggested
that
he
was
in
love
with
her
but
this
he
vehemently
denied
sir
i
have
got
no
sort
of
affection
for
the
lady
my
trouble
is
that
she
puts
me
out
of
countenance
and
i
ca
fit
her
in
as
an
antagonist
i
guess
we
americans
have
got
the
right
poise
for
dealing
with
that
kind
of
female
we
exalted
our
womenfolk
into
little
tin
gods
and
at
the
same
time
left
them
out
of
the
real
business
of
life
consequently
when
we
strike
one
playing
the
biggest
kind
of
man
game
we
ca
place
her
we
are
used
to
regarding
them
as
anything
except
angels
and
children
i
wish
i
had
had
you
boys
upbringing
angora
was
like
my
notion
of
some
place
such
as
amiens
in
the
retreat
from
mons
it
was
one
mass
of
troops
and
transport
the
neck
of
the
bottle
for
more
arrived
every
hour
and
the
only
outlet
was
the
single
eastern
road
the
town
was
pandemonium
into
which
distracted
german
officers
were
trying
to
introduce
some
order
they
did
worry
much
about
us
for
the
heart
of
anatolia
was
a
likely
for
suspicious
characters
we
took
our
passport
to
the
commandant
who
visaed
them
readily
and
told
us
he
do
his
best
to
get
us
transport
we
spent
the
night
in
a
sort
of
hotel
where
all
four
crowded
into
one
little
bedroom
and
next
morning
i
had
my
work
cut
out
getting
a
it
took
four
hours
and
the
use
of
every
great
name
in
the
turkish
empire
to
raise
a
dingy
sort
of
studebaker
and
another
two
to
get
the
petrol
and
spare
tyres
as
for
a
chauffeur
love
or
money
could
find
him
and
i
was
compelled
to
drive
the
thing
myself
we
left
just
after
midday
and
swung
out
into
bare
bleak
downs
patched
with
scrubby
woodlands
there
was
no
snow
here
but
a
wind
was
blowing
from
the
east
which
searched
the
marrow
presently
we
climbed
up
into
hills
and
the
road
though
not
badly
engineered
to
begin
with
grew
as
rough
as
the
channel
of
a
stream
no
wonder
for
the
traffic
was
like
what
one
saw
on
that
awful
stretch
between
cassel
and
ypres
and
there
were
no
gangs
of
belgian
roadmakers
to
mend
it
up
we
found
troops
by
the
thousands
striding
along
with
their
impassive
turkish
faces
ox
convoys
mule
convoys
wagons
drawn
by
sturdy
little
anatolian
horses
and
coming
in
the
contrary
direction
many
shabby
red
crescent
cars
and
wagons
of
the
wounded
we
had
to
crawl
for
hours
on
end
till
we
got
past
a
block
just
before
the
darkening
we
seemed
to
outstrip
the
first
press
and
had
a
clear
run
for
about
ten
miles
over
a
low
pass
in
the
hills
i
began
to
get
anxious
about
the
car
for
it
was
a
poor
one
at
the
best
and
the
road
was
guaranteed
sooner
or
later
to
knock
even
a
into
scrap
iron
all
the
same
it
was
glorious
to
be
out
in
the
open
again
peter
face
wore
a
new
look
and
he
sniffed
the
bitter
air
like
a
stag
there
floated
up
from
little
wayside
camps
the
odour
of
and
that
and
the
curious
acrid
winter
smell
of
great
spaces
will
always
come
to
my
memory
as
i
think
of
that
day
every
hour
brought
me
peace
of
mind
and
resolution
i
felt
as
i
had
felt
when
the
battalion
first
marched
from
aire
towards
the
a
kind
of
and
wild
expectation
i
not
used
to
cities
and
lounging
about
constantinople
had
slackened
my
fibre
now
as
the
sharp
wind
buffeted
us
i
felt
braced
to
any
kind
of
risk
we
were
on
the
great
road
to
the
east
and
the
border
hills
and
soon
we
should
stand
upon
the
farthest
of
the
war
this
was
no
commonplace
intelligence
job
that
was
all
over
and
we
were
going
into
the
going
to
take
part
in
what
might
be
the
downfall
of
our
enemies
i
did
reflect
that
we
were
among
those
enemies
and
would
probably
share
their
downfall
if
we
were
not
shot
earlier
the
truth
is
i
had
got
out
of
the
way
of
regarding
the
thing
as
a
struggle
between
armies
and
nations
i
hardly
bothered
to
think
where
my
sympathies
lay
first
and
foremost
it
was
a
contest
between
the
four
of
us
and
a
crazy
woman
and
this
personal
antagonism
made
the
strife
of
armies
only
a
background
we
slept
that
night
like
logs
on
the
floor
of
a
dirty
khan
and
started
next
morning
in
a
powder
of
snow
we
were
getting
very
high
up
now
and
it
was
perishing
cold
the
companion
his
name
sounded
like
hussin
had
travelled
the
road
before
and
told
me
what
the
places
were
but
they
conveyed
nothing
to
me
all
morning
we
wriggled
through
a
big
lot
of
troops
a
brigade
at
least
who
swung
along
at
a
great
pace
with
a
fine
free
stride
that
i
do
think
i
have
ever
seen
bettered
i
must
say
i
took
a
fancy
to
the
turkish
fighting
man
i
remembered
the
testimonial
our
fellows
gave
him
as
a
clean
fighter
and
i
felt
very
bitter
that
germany
should
have
lugged
him
into
this
dirty
business
they
halted
for
a
meal
and
we
stopped
too
and
lunched
off
some
brown
bread
and
dried
figs
and
a
flask
of
very
sour
wine
i
had
a
few
words
with
one
of
the
officers
who
spoke
a
little
german
he
told
me
they
were
marching
straight
for
russia
since
there
had
been
a
great
turkish
victory
in
the
caucasus
have
beaten
the
french
and
the
british
and
now
it
is
russia
turn
he
said
stolidly
as
if
repeating
a
lesson
but
he
added
that
he
was
mortally
sick
of
war
in
the
afternoon
we
cleared
the
column
and
had
an
open
road
for
some
hours
the
land
now
had
a
tilt
eastward
as
if
we
were
moving
towards
the
valley
of
a
great
river
soon
we
began
to
meet
little
parties
of
men
coming
from
the
east
with
a
new
look
in
their
faces
the
first
lots
of
wounded
had
been
the
ordinary
thing
you
see
on
every
front
and
there
had
been
some
pretence
at
organization
but
these
new
lots
were
very
weary
and
broken
they
were
often
barefoot
and
they
seemed
to
have
lost
their
transport
and
to
be
starving
you
would
find
a
group
stretched
by
the
roadside
in
the
last
stages
of
exhaustion
then
would
come
a
party
limping
along
so
tired
that
they
never
turned
their
heads
to
look
at
us
almost
all
were
wounded
some
badly
and
most
were
horribly
thin
i
wondered
how
my
turkish
friend
behind
would
explain
the
sight
to
his
men
if
he
believed
in
a
great
victory
they
had
not
the
air
of
the
backwash
of
a
conquering
army
even
blenkiron
who
was
no
soldier
noticed
it
boys
look
mighty
bad
he
observed
got
to
hustle
major
if
we
going
to
get
seats
for
the
last
act
that
was
my
own
feeling
the
sight
made
me
mad
to
get
on
faster
for
i
saw
that
big
things
were
happening
in
the
east
i
had
reckoned
that
four
days
would
take
us
from
angora
to
erzerum
but
here
was
the
second
nearly
over
and
we
were
not
yet
a
third
of
the
way
i
pressed
on
recklessly
and
that
hurry
was
our
undoing
i
have
said
that
the
studebaker
was
a
rotten
old
car
its
was
pretty
dicky
and
the
bad
surface
and
continual
hairpin
bends
of
the
road
did
improve
it
soon
we
came
into
snow
lying
fairly
deep
frozen
hard
and
rutted
by
the
big
we
bumped
and
bounced
horribly
and
were
shaken
about
like
peas
in
a
bladder
i
began
to
be
acutely
anxious
about
the
old
boneshaker
the
more
as
we
seemed
a
long
way
short
of
the
village
i
had
proposed
to
spend
the
night
in
twilight
was
falling
and
we
were
still
in
an
unfeatured
waste
crossing
the
shallow
glen
of
a
stream
there
was
a
bridge
at
the
bottom
of
a
slope
a
bridge
of
logs
and
earth
which
had
apparently
been
freshly
strengthened
for
heavy
traffic
as
we
approached
it
at
a
good
pace
the
car
ceased
to
answer
to
the
wheel
i
struggled
desperately
to
keep
it
straight
but
it
swerved
to
the
left
and
we
plunged
over
a
bank
into
a
marshy
hollow
there
was
a
sickening
bump
as
we
struck
the
lower
ground
and
the
whole
party
were
shot
out
into
the
frozen
slush
i
do
yet
know
how
i
escaped
for
the
car
turned
over
and
by
rights
i
should
have
had
my
back
broken
but
no
one
was
hurt
peter
was
laughing
and
blenkiron
after
shaking
the
snow
out
of
his
hair
joined
him
for
myself
i
was
feverishly
examining
the
machine
it
was
about
as
ugly
as
it
could
be
for
the
front
axle
was
broken
here
was
a
piece
of
hopeless
bad
luck
we
were
stuck
in
the
middle
of
asia
minor
with
no
means
of
conveyance
for
to
get
a
new
axle
there
was
as
likely
as
to
find
snowballs
on
the
congo
it
was
all
but
dark
and
there
was
no
time
to
lose
i
got
out
the
petrol
tins
and
spare
tyres
and
cached
them
among
some
rocks
on
the
hillside
then
we
collected
our
scanty
baggage
from
the
derelict
studebaker
our
only
hope
was
hussin
he
had
got
to
find
us
some
lodging
for
the
night
and
next
day
we
would
have
a
try
for
horses
or
a
lift
in
some
passing
wagon
i
had
no
hope
of
another
car
every
automobile
in
anatolia
would
now
be
at
a
premium
it
was
so
disgusting
a
mishap
that
we
all
took
it
quietly
it
was
too
bad
to
be
helped
by
hard
swearing
hussin
and
peter
set
off
on
different
sides
of
the
road
to
prospect
for
a
house
and
blenkiron
and
i
sheltered
under
the
nearest
rock
and
smoked
savagely
hussin
was
the
first
to
strike
oil
he
came
back
in
twenty
minutes
with
news
of
some
kind
of
dwelling
a
couple
of
miles
up
the
stream
he
went
off
to
collect
peter
and
humping
our
baggage
blenkiron
and
i
plodded
up
the
waterside
darkness
had
fallen
thick
by
this
time
and
we
took
some
bad
tosses
among
the
bogs
when
hussin
and
peter
overtook
us
they
found
a
better
road
and
presently
we
saw
a
light
twinkle
in
the
hollow
ahead
it
proved
to
be
a
wretched
farm
in
a
grove
of
poplars
a
muddy
yard
a
hovel
of
a
house
and
a
barn
which
was
tolerably
dry
and
which
we
selected
for
our
the
owner
was
a
broken
old
fellow
whose
sons
were
all
at
the
war
and
he
received
us
with
the
profound
calm
of
one
who
expects
nothing
but
unpleasantness
from
life
by
this
time
we
had
recovered
our
tempers
and
i
was
trying
hard
to
put
my
new
kismet
philosophy
into
practice
i
reckoned
that
if
risks
were
foreordained
so
were
difficulties
and
both
must
be
taken
as
part
of
the
day
work
with
the
remains
of
our
provisions
and
some
curdled
milk
we
satisfied
our
hunger
and
curled
ourselves
up
among
the
pease
straw
of
the
barn
blenkiron
announced
with
a
happy
sigh
that
he
had
now
been
for
two
days
quit
of
his
dyspepsia
that
night
i
remember
i
had
a
queer
dream
i
seemed
to
be
in
a
wild
place
among
mountains
and
i
was
being
hunted
though
who
was
after
me
i
could
tell
i
remember
sweating
with
fright
for
i
seemed
to
be
quite
alone
and
the
terror
that
was
pursuing
me
was
more
than
human
the
place
was
horribly
quiet
and
still
and
there
was
deep
snow
lying
everywhere
so
that
each
step
i
took
was
heavy
as
lead
a
very
ordinary
sort
of
nightmare
you
will
say
yes
but
there
was
one
strange
feature
in
this
one
the
night
was
pitch
dark
but
ahead
of
me
in
the
throat
of
the
pass
there
was
one
patch
of
light
and
it
showed
a
rum
little
hill
with
a
rocky
top
what
we
call
in
south
africa
a
or
saucepan
i
had
a
notion
that
if
i
could
get
to
that
i
should
be
safe
and
i
panted
through
the
drifts
towards
it
with
the
avenger
of
blood
at
my
heels
i
woke
gasping
to
find
the
winter
morning
struggling
through
the
cracked
rafters
and
to
hear
blenkiron
say
cheerily
that
his
duodenum
had
behaved
all
night
like
a
gentleman
i
lay
still
for
a
bit
trying
to
fix
the
dream
but
it
all
dissolved
into
haze
except
the
picture
of
the
little
hill
which
was
quite
clear
in
every
detail
i
told
myself
it
was
a
reminiscence
of
the
veld
some
spot
down
in
the
wakkerstroom
country
though
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
place
it
i
pass
over
the
next
three
days
for
they
were
one
uninterrupted
series
of
hussin
and
peter
scoured
the
country
for
horses
blenkiron
sat
in
the
barn
and
played
patience
while
i
haunted
the
roadside
near
the
bridge
in
the
hope
of
picking
up
some
kind
of
conveyance
my
task
was
perfectly
futile
the
columns
passed
casting
wondering
eyes
on
the
wrecked
car
among
the
frozen
rushes
but
they
could
offer
no
help
my
friend
the
turkish
officer
promised
to
wire
to
angora
from
some
place
or
other
for
a
fresh
car
but
remembering
the
state
of
affairs
at
angora
i
had
no
hope
from
that
quarter
cars
passed
plenty
of
them
packed
with
turkish
and
german
but
they
were
in
far
too
big
a
hurry
even
to
stop
and
speak
the
only
conclusion
i
reached
from
my
roadside
vigil
was
that
things
were
getting
very
warm
in
the
neighbourhood
of
erzerum
everybody
on
that
road
seemed
to
be
in
mad
haste
either
to
get
there
or
to
get
away
hussin
was
the
best
chance
for
as
i
have
said
the
companions
had
a
very
special
and
peculiar
graft
throughout
the
turkish
empire
but
the
first
day
he
came
back
all
the
horses
had
been
commandeered
for
the
war
he
said
and
though
he
was
certain
that
some
had
been
kept
back
and
hidden
away
he
could
not
get
on
their
track
the
second
day
he
returned
with
two
miserable
screws
and
deplorably
short
in
the
wind
from
a
diet
of
beans
there
was
no
decent
corn
or
hay
left
in
the
countryside
the
third
day
he
picked
up
a
nice
little
arab
stallion
in
poor
condition
it
is
true
but
perfectly
sound
for
these
beasts
we
paid
good
money
for
blenkiron
was
well
supplied
and
we
had
no
time
to
spare
for
the
interminable
oriental
bargaining
hussin
said
he
had
cleaned
up
the
countryside
and
i
believed
him
i
dared
not
delay
another
day
even
though
it
meant
leaving
him
behind
but
he
had
no
notion
of
doing
anything
of
the
kind
he
was
a
good
runner
he
said
and
could
keep
up
with
such
horses
as
ours
for
ever
if
this
was
the
manner
of
our
progress
i
reckoned
we
would
be
weeks
in
getting
to
erzerum
we
started
at
dawn
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
day
after
the
old
farmer
had
blessed
us
and
sold
us
some
stale
blenkiron
bestrode
the
arab
being
the
heaviest
and
peter
and
i
had
the
screws
my
worst
forebodings
were
soon
realized
and
hussin
loping
along
at
my
side
had
an
easy
job
to
keep
up
with
us
we
were
about
as
slow
as
an
the
brutes
were
unshod
and
with
the
rough
roads
i
saw
that
their
feet
would
very
soon
go
to
pieces
we
jogged
along
like
a
tinker
caravan
about
five
miles
to
the
hour
as
feckless
a
party
as
ever
disgraced
a
highroad
the
weather
was
now
a
drizzle
which
increased
my
depression
cars
passed
us
and
disappeared
in
the
mist
going
at
thirty
miles
an
hour
to
mock
our
slowness
none
of
us
spoke
for
the
futility
of
the
business
clogged
our
spirits
i
bit
hard
on
my
lip
to
curb
my
restlessness
and
i
think
i
would
have
sold
my
soul
there
and
then
for
anything
that
could
move
fast
i
do
know
any
sorer
trial
than
to
be
mad
for
speed
and
have
to
crawl
at
a
snail
pace
i
was
getting
ripe
for
any
kind
of
desperate
venture
about
midday
we
descended
on
a
wide
plain
full
of
the
marks
of
rich
cultivation
villages
became
frequent
and
the
land
was
studded
with
olive
groves
and
scarred
with
water
furrows
from
what
i
remembered
of
the
map
i
judged
that
we
were
coming
to
that
champagne
country
near
siwas
which
is
the
granary
of
turkey
and
the
home
of
the
true
osmanli
stock
then
at
the
turning
of
the
road
we
came
to
the
caravanserai
it
was
a
dingy
battered
place
with
the
pink
plaster
falling
in
patches
from
its
walls
there
was
a
courtyard
abutting
on
the
road
and
a
house
with
a
big
hole
in
its
side
it
was
a
long
way
from
any
and
i
guessed
that
some
explosion
had
wrought
the
damage
behind
it
a
few
hundred
yards
off
a
detachment
of
cavalry
were
encamped
beside
a
stream
with
their
horses
tied
up
in
long
lines
of
pickets
and
by
the
roadside
quite
alone
and
deserted
stood
a
large
new
in
all
the
road
before
and
behind
there
was
no
man
to
be
seen
except
the
troops
by
the
stream
the
owners
whoever
they
were
must
be
inside
the
caravanserai
i
have
said
i
was
in
the
mood
for
some
desperate
deed
and
lo
and
behold
providence
had
given
me
the
chance
i
coveted
that
car
as
i
have
never
coveted
anything
on
earth
at
the
moment
all
my
plans
had
narrowed
down
to
a
feverish
passion
to
get
to
the
we
had
to
find
greenmantle
at
erzerum
and
once
there
we
should
have
hilda
von
einem
protection
it
was
a
time
of
war
and
a
front
of
brass
was
the
surest
safety
but
indeed
i
could
not
figure
out
any
plan
worth
speaking
of
i
saw
only
one
thing
a
fast
car
which
might
be
ours
i
said
a
word
to
the
others
and
we
dismounted
and
tethered
our
horses
at
the
near
end
of
the
courtyard
i
heard
the
low
hum
of
voices
from
the
cavalrymen
by
the
stream
but
they
were
three
hundred
yards
off
and
could
not
see
us
peter
was
sent
forward
to
scout
in
the
courtyard
in
the
building
itself
there
was
but
one
window
looking
on
the
road
and
that
was
in
the
upper
floor
meantime
i
crawled
along
beside
the
wall
to
where
the
car
stood
and
had
a
look
at
it
it
was
a
splendid
affair
brand
new
with
the
tyres
little
worn
there
were
seven
tins
of
petrol
stacked
behind
as
well
as
spare
tyres
and
looking
in
i
saw
and
strewn
on
the
seats
as
if
the
owners
had
only
got
out
for
a
minute
to
stretch
their
legs
peter
came
back
and
reported
that
the
courtyard
was
empty
are
men
in
the
upper
room
he
said
than
one
for
i
heard
their
voices
they
are
moving
about
restlessly
and
may
soon
be
coming
out
i
reckoned
that
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
so
i
told
the
others
to
slip
down
the
road
fifty
yards
beyond
the
caravanserai
and
be
ready
to
climb
in
as
i
passed
i
had
to
start
the
infernal
thing
and
there
might
be
shooting
i
waited
by
the
car
till
i
saw
them
reach
the
right
distance
i
could
hear
voices
from
the
second
floor
of
the
house
and
footsteps
moving
up
and
down
i
was
in
a
fever
of
anxiety
for
any
moment
a
man
might
come
to
the
window
then
i
flung
myself
on
the
starting
handle
and
worked
like
a
demon
the
cold
made
the
job
difficult
and
my
heart
was
in
my
mouth
for
the
noise
in
that
quiet
place
must
have
woke
the
dead
then
by
the
mercy
of
heaven
the
engine
started
and
i
sprang
to
the
driving
seat
released
the
clutch
and
opened
the
throttle
the
great
car
shot
forward
and
i
seemed
to
hear
behind
me
shrill
voices
a
pistol
bullet
bored
through
my
hat
and
another
buried
itself
in
a
cushion
beside
me
in
a
second
i
was
clear
of
the
place
and
the
rest
of
the
party
were
embarking
blenkiron
got
on
the
step
and
rolled
himself
like
a
sack
of
coals
into
the
tonneau
peter
nipped
up
beside
me
and
hussin
scrambled
in
from
the
back
over
the
folds
of
the
hood
we
had
our
baggage
in
our
pockets
and
had
nothing
to
carry
bullets
dropped
round
us
but
did
no
harm
then
i
heard
a
report
at
my
ear
and
out
of
a
corner
of
my
eye
saw
peter
lower
his
pistol
presently
we
were
out
of
range
and
looking
back
i
saw
three
men
gesticulating
in
the
middle
of
the
road
the
devil
fly
away
with
this
pistol
said
peter
ruefully
never
could
make
good
shooting
with
a
little
gun
had
i
had
my
rifle
did
you
shoot
for
i
asked
in
amazement
got
the
fellows
car
and
we
do
want
to
do
them
any
harm
would
have
saved
trouble
had
i
had
my
rifle
said
peter
quietly
little
man
you
call
rasta
was
there
and
he
knew
you
i
heard
him
cry
your
name
he
is
an
angry
little
man
and
i
observe
that
on
this
road
there
is
a
telegraph
chapter
seventeen
trouble
by
the
waters
of
babylon
from
that
moment
i
date
the
beginning
of
my
madness
suddenly
i
forgot
all
cares
and
difficulties
of
the
present
and
future
and
became
foolishly
we
were
rushing
towards
the
great
battle
where
men
were
busy
at
my
proper
trade
i
realized
how
much
i
had
loathed
the
lonely
days
in
germany
and
still
more
the
dawdling
week
in
constantinople
now
i
was
clear
of
it
all
and
bound
for
the
clash
of
armies
it
did
trouble
me
that
we
were
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
battle
line
i
had
a
sort
of
instinct
that
the
darker
and
wilder
things
grew
the
better
chance
for
us
to
me
said
blenkiron
bending
over
me
this
is
going
to
come
to
an
untimely
end
pretty
soon
peter
right
that
young
man
will
set
the
telegraph
going
and
we
be
held
up
at
the
next
township
got
to
get
to
a
telegraph
office
first
i
answered
where
we
have
the
pull
on
him
he
welcome
to
the
screws
we
left
behind
and
if
he
finds
an
operator
before
the
evening
i
the
worst
kind
of
a
dutchman
i
going
to
break
all
the
rules
and
bucket
this
car
for
what
she
worth
do
you
see
that
the
nearer
we
get
to
erzerum
the
safer
we
are
do
follow
he
said
slowly
erzerum
i
reckon
they
be
waiting
for
us
with
the
handcuffs
why
in
thunder
could
those
hairy
ragamuffins
keep
the
little
cuss
safe
your
record
a
bit
too
precipitous
major
for
the
most
military
boss
you
remember
what
you
said
about
the
germans
being
open
to
bluff
well
i
going
to
put
up
the
steepest
sort
of
bluff
of
course
they
stop
us
rasta
will
do
his
damnedest
but
remember
that
he
and
his
friends
are
not
very
popular
with
the
germans
and
madame
von
einem
is
we
her
proteges
and
the
bigger
the
german
swell
i
get
before
the
safer
i
feel
we
got
our
passports
and
our
orders
and
he
be
a
bold
man
that
will
stop
us
once
we
get
into
the
german
zone
therefore
i
going
to
hurry
as
fast
as
god
will
let
me
it
was
a
ride
that
deserved
to
have
an
epic
written
about
it
the
car
was
good
and
i
handled
her
well
though
i
say
it
who
should
the
road
in
that
big
central
plain
was
fair
and
often
i
knocked
fifty
miles
an
hour
out
of
her
we
passed
troops
by
a
circuit
over
the
veld
where
we
took
some
awful
risks
and
once
we
skidded
by
some
transport
with
our
off
wheels
almost
over
the
lip
of
a
ravine
we
went
through
the
narrow
streets
of
siwas
like
a
while
i
shouted
out
in
german
that
we
carried
despatches
for
headquarters
we
shot
out
of
drizzling
rain
into
brief
spells
of
winter
sunshine
and
then
into
a
snow
blizzard
which
all
but
whipped
the
skin
from
our
faces
and
always
before
us
the
long
road
unrolled
with
somewhere
at
the
end
of
it
two
armies
clinched
in
a
that
night
we
looked
for
no
lodging
we
ate
a
sort
of
meal
in
the
car
with
the
hood
up
and
felt
our
way
on
in
the
darkness
for
the
headlights
were
in
perfect
order
then
we
turned
off
the
road
for
four
hours
sleep
and
i
had
a
go
at
the
map
before
dawn
we
started
again
and
came
over
a
pass
into
the
vale
of
a
big
river
the
winter
dawn
showed
its
gleaming
stretches
among
the
sprinkled
meadows
i
called
to
blenkiron
believe
that
river
is
the
euphrates
i
said
he
said
acutely
interested
that
the
waters
of
babylon
great
snakes
that
i
should
have
lived
to
see
the
fields
where
king
nebuchadnezzar
grazed
do
you
know
the
name
of
that
big
hill
major
as
like
as
not
i
cried
and
he
believed
me
we
were
among
the
hills
now
great
rocky
black
slopes
and
seen
through
side
glens
a
hinterland
of
snowy
peaks
i
remember
i
kept
looking
for
the
i
had
seen
in
my
dream
the
thing
had
never
left
off
haunting
me
and
i
was
pretty
clear
now
that
it
did
not
belong
to
my
south
african
memories
i
am
not
a
superstitious
man
but
the
way
that
little
clung
to
my
mind
made
me
think
it
was
a
warning
sent
by
providence
i
was
pretty
certain
that
when
i
clapped
eyes
on
it
i
would
be
in
for
bad
trouble
all
morning
we
travelled
up
that
broad
vale
and
just
before
noon
it
spread
out
wider
the
road
dipped
to
the
water
edge
and
i
saw
before
me
the
white
roofs
of
a
town
the
snow
was
deep
now
and
lay
down
to
the
riverside
but
the
sky
had
cleared
and
against
a
space
of
blue
heaven
some
peaks
to
the
south
rose
glittering
like
jewels
the
arches
of
a
bridge
spanning
two
forks
of
the
stream
showed
in
front
and
as
i
slowed
down
at
the
bend
a
sentry
challenge
rang
out
from
a
we
had
reached
the
fortress
of
erzingjan
the
headquarters
of
a
turkish
corps
and
the
gate
of
armenia
i
showed
the
man
our
passports
but
he
did
not
salute
and
let
us
move
on
he
called
another
fellow
from
the
guardhouse
who
motioned
us
to
keep
pace
with
him
as
he
stumped
down
a
side
lane
at
the
other
end
was
a
big
barracks
with
sentries
outside
the
man
spoke
to
us
in
turkish
which
hussin
interpreted
there
was
somebody
in
that
barracks
who
wanted
badly
to
see
us
the
waters
of
babylon
we
sat
down
and
wept
quoted
blenkiron
softly
fear
major
we
soon
be
remembering
zion
i
tried
to
persuade
myself
that
this
was
merely
the
red
tape
of
a
frontier
fortress
but
i
had
an
instinct
that
difficulties
were
in
store
for
us
if
rasta
had
started
wiring
i
was
prepared
to
put
up
the
brazenest
bluff
for
we
were
still
eighty
miles
from
erzerum
and
at
all
costs
we
were
going
to
be
landed
there
before
night
a
fussy
met
us
at
the
door
at
the
sight
of
us
he
cried
to
a
friend
to
come
and
look
are
the
birds
safe
a
fat
man
and
two
lean
ones
and
a
savage
who
looks
like
a
kurd
call
the
guard
and
march
them
off
there
no
doubt
about
their
identity
me
sir
i
said
we
have
no
time
to
spare
and
we
like
to
be
in
erzerum
before
the
dark
i
would
beg
you
to
get
through
any
formalities
as
soon
as
possible
this
man
and
i
pointed
to
the
sentry
our
passports
yourself
he
said
impudently
not
going
on
just
yet
and
when
you
do
it
wo
be
in
a
stolen
car
he
took
the
passports
and
fingered
them
casually
then
something
he
saw
there
made
him
cock
his
eyebrows
did
you
steal
these
he
asked
but
with
less
assurance
in
his
tone
i
spoke
very
gently
seem
to
be
the
victim
of
a
mistake
sir
these
are
our
papers
we
are
under
orders
to
report
ourselves
at
erzerum
without
an
hour
delay
whoever
hinders
us
will
have
to
answer
to
general
von
liman
we
will
be
obliged
if
you
will
conduct
us
at
once
to
the
governor
ca
see
general
posselt
he
said
is
my
business
i
have
a
wire
from
siwas
that
four
men
stole
a
car
belonging
to
one
of
enver
damad
staff
it
describes
you
all
and
says
that
two
of
you
are
notorious
spies
wanted
by
the
imperial
government
what
have
you
to
say
to
that
that
it
is
rubbish
my
good
sir
you
have
seen
our
passes
our
errand
is
not
to
be
cried
on
the
housetops
but
five
minutes
with
general
posselt
will
make
things
clear
you
will
be
exceedingly
sorry
for
it
if
you
delay
another
minute
he
was
impressed
in
spite
of
himself
and
after
pulling
his
moustache
turned
on
his
heel
and
left
us
presently
he
came
back
and
said
very
gruffly
that
the
governor
would
see
us
we
followed
him
along
a
corridor
into
a
big
room
looking
out
on
the
river
where
an
oldish
fellow
sat
in
an
by
a
stove
writing
letters
with
a
fountain
pen
this
was
posselt
who
had
been
governor
of
erzerum
till
he
fell
sick
and
ahmed
fevzi
took
his
place
he
had
a
peevish
mouth
and
big
blue
pouches
below
his
eyes
he
was
supposed
to
be
a
good
engineer
and
to
have
made
erzerum
impregnable
but
the
look
on
his
face
gave
me
the
impression
that
his
reputation
at
the
moment
was
a
bit
unstable
the
spoke
to
him
in
an
undertone
yes
i
know
he
said
testily
these
the
men
they
look
a
pretty
lot
of
scoundrels
what
that
you
say
they
deny
it
but
they
got
the
car
they
ca
deny
that
here
you
and
he
fixed
on
blenkiron
the
devil
are
you
blenkiron
smiled
sleepily
at
him
not
understanding
one
word
and
i
took
up
the
parable
passports
sir
give
our
credentials
i
said
he
glanced
through
them
and
his
face
lengthened
right
enough
but
what
about
this
story
of
stealing
a
car
is
quite
true
i
said
i
would
prefer
to
use
a
pleasanter
word
you
will
see
from
our
papers
that
every
authority
on
the
road
is
directed
to
give
us
the
best
transport
our
own
car
broke
down
and
after
a
long
delay
we
got
some
wretched
horses
it
is
vitally
important
that
we
should
be
in
erzerum
without
delay
so
i
took
the
liberty
of
appropriating
an
empty
car
we
found
outside
an
inn
i
am
sorry
for
the
discomfort
of
the
owners
but
our
business
was
too
grave
to
wait
the
telegram
says
you
are
notorious
spies
i
smiled
sent
the
telegram
see
no
reason
why
i
should
give
you
his
name
it
was
rasta
bey
you
picked
an
awkward
fellow
to
make
an
enemy
of
i
did
not
smile
but
laughed
i
cried
one
of
satellites
that
explains
many
things
i
should
like
a
word
with
you
alone
sir
he
nodded
to
the
and
when
he
had
gone
i
put
on
my
most
bible
face
and
looked
as
important
as
a
provincial
mayor
at
a
royal
visit
can
speak
freely
i
said
i
am
speaking
to
a
soldier
of
germany
there
is
no
love
lost
between
enver
and
those
i
serve
i
need
not
tell
you
that
this
rasta
thought
he
had
found
a
chance
of
delaying
us
so
he
invents
this
trash
about
spies
those
comitadjis
have
spies
on
the
brain
especially
he
hates
frau
von
einem
he
jumped
at
the
name
have
orders
from
her
he
asked
in
a
respectful
tone
yes
i
answered
those
orders
will
not
wait
he
got
up
and
walked
to
a
table
whence
he
turned
a
puzzled
face
on
me
torn
in
two
between
the
turks
and
my
own
countrymen
if
i
please
one
i
offend
the
other
and
the
result
is
a
damnable
confusion
you
can
go
on
to
erzerum
but
i
shall
send
a
man
with
you
to
see
that
you
report
to
headquarters
there
i
sorry
gentlemen
but
i
obliged
to
take
no
chances
in
this
business
rasta
got
a
grievance
against
you
but
you
can
easily
hide
behind
the
lady
skirts
she
passed
through
this
town
two
days
ago
ten
minutes
later
we
were
coasting
through
the
slush
of
the
narrow
streets
with
a
stolid
german
lieutenant
sitting
beside
me
the
afternoon
was
one
of
those
rare
days
when
in
the
pauses
of
snow
you
have
a
spell
of
weather
as
mild
as
may
i
remembered
several
like
it
during
our
winter
training
in
hampshire
the
road
was
a
fine
one
well
engineered
and
well
kept
too
considering
the
amount
of
traffic
we
were
little
delayed
for
it
was
sufficiently
broad
to
let
us
pass
troops
and
transport
without
slackening
pace
the
fellow
at
my
side
was
enough
but
his
presence
naturally
put
the
lid
on
our
conversation
i
did
want
to
talk
however
i
was
trying
to
piece
together
a
plan
and
making
very
little
of
it
for
i
had
nothing
to
go
upon
we
must
find
hilda
von
einem
and
sandy
and
between
us
we
must
wreck
the
greenmantle
business
that
done
it
did
matter
so
much
what
happened
to
us
as
i
reasoned
it
out
the
turks
must
be
in
a
bad
way
and
unless
they
got
a
fillip
from
greenmantle
would
crumple
up
before
the
russians
in
the
rout
i
hoped
we
might
get
a
chance
to
change
our
sides
but
it
was
no
good
looking
so
far
forward
the
first
thing
was
to
get
to
sandy
now
i
was
still
in
the
mood
of
reckless
bravado
which
i
had
got
from
bagging
the
car
i
did
not
realize
how
thin
our
story
was
and
how
easily
rasta
might
have
a
big
graft
at
headquarters
if
i
had
i
would
have
shot
out
the
german
lieutenant
long
before
we
got
to
erzerum
and
found
some
way
of
getting
mixed
up
in
the
ruck
of
the
population
hussin
could
have
helped
me
to
that
i
was
getting
so
confident
since
our
interview
with
posselt
that
i
thought
i
could
bluff
the
whole
outfit
but
my
main
business
that
afternoon
was
pure
nonsense
i
was
trying
to
find
my
little
hill
at
every
turn
of
the
road
i
expected
to
see
the
before
us
you
must
know
that
ever
since
i
could
stand
i
have
been
crazy
about
high
mountains
my
father
took
me
to
basutoland
when
i
was
a
boy
and
i
reckon
i
have
scrambled
over
almost
every
bit
of
upland
south
of
the
zambesi
from
the
hottentots
holland
to
the
zoutpansberg
and
from
the
ugly
yellow
kopjes
of
damaraland
to
the
noble
cliffs
of
mont
aux
sources
one
of
the
things
i
had
looked
forward
to
in
coming
home
was
the
chance
of
climbing
the
alps
but
now
i
was
among
peaks
that
i
fancied
were
bigger
than
the
alps
and
i
could
hardly
keep
my
eyes
on
the
road
i
was
pretty
certain
that
my
was
among
them
for
that
dream
had
taken
an
almighty
hold
on
my
mind
funnily
enough
i
was
ceasing
to
think
it
a
place
of
evil
omen
for
one
soon
forgets
the
atmosphere
of
nightmare
but
i
was
convinced
that
it
was
a
thing
i
was
destined
to
see
and
to
see
pretty
soon
darkness
fell
when
we
were
some
miles
short
of
the
city
and
the
last
part
was
difficult
driving
on
both
sides
of
the
road
transport
and
engineers
stores
were
parked
and
some
of
it
strayed
into
the
highway
i
noticed
lots
of
small
details
detachments
signalling
parties
squads
of
which
mean
the
fringe
of
an
army
and
as
soon
as
the
night
began
the
white
fingers
of
searchlights
began
to
grope
in
the
skies
and
then
above
the
hum
of
the
roadside
rose
the
voice
of
the
great
guns
the
shells
were
bursting
four
or
five
miles
away
and
the
guns
must
have
been
as
many
more
distant
but
in
that
upland
pocket
of
plain
in
the
frosty
night
they
sounded
most
intimately
near
they
kept
up
their
solemn
litany
with
a
minute
interval
between
each
no
which
rumbles
like
a
drum
but
the
steady
persistence
of
artillery
exactly
ranged
on
a
target
i
judged
they
must
be
bombarding
the
outer
forts
and
once
there
came
a
loud
explosion
and
a
red
glare
as
if
a
magazine
had
suffered
it
was
a
sound
i
had
not
heard
for
five
months
and
it
fairly
crazed
me
i
remembered
how
i
had
first
heard
it
on
the
ridge
before
laventie
then
i
had
been
but
every
nerve
had
been
quickened
then
it
had
been
the
new
thing
in
my
life
that
held
me
breathless
with
anticipation
now
it
was
the
old
thing
the
thing
i
had
shared
with
so
many
good
fellows
my
proper
work
and
the
only
task
for
a
man
at
the
sound
of
the
guns
i
felt
that
i
was
moving
in
natural
air
once
more
i
felt
that
i
was
coming
home
we
were
stopped
at
a
long
line
of
ramparts
and
a
german
sergeant
stared
at
us
till
he
saw
the
lieutenant
beside
me
when
he
saluted
and
we
passed
on
almost
at
once
we
dipped
into
narrow
twisting
streets
choked
with
soldiers
where
it
was
hard
business
to
steer
there
were
few
lights
only
now
and
then
the
flare
of
a
torch
which
showed
the
grey
stone
houses
with
every
window
latticed
and
shuttered
i
had
put
out
my
headlights
and
had
only
side
lamps
so
we
had
to
pick
our
way
gingerly
through
the
labyrinth
i
hoped
we
would
strike
quarters
soon
for
we
were
all
pretty
empty
and
a
frost
had
set
in
which
made
our
thick
coats
seem
as
thin
as
paper
the
lieutenant
did
the
guiding
we
had
to
present
our
passports
and
i
anticipated
no
more
difficulty
than
in
landing
from
the
boat
at
boulogne
but
i
wanted
to
get
it
over
for
my
hunger
pinched
me
and
it
was
fearsome
cold
still
the
guns
went
on
like
hounds
baying
before
a
quarry
the
city
was
out
of
range
but
there
were
strange
lights
on
the
ridge
to
the
east
at
last
we
reached
our
goal
and
marched
through
a
fine
old
carved
archway
into
a
courtyard
and
thence
into
a
draughty
hall
must
see
the
said
our
guide
i
looked
round
to
see
if
we
were
all
there
and
noticed
that
hussin
had
disappeared
it
did
not
matter
for
he
was
not
on
the
passports
we
followed
as
we
were
directed
through
an
open
door
there
was
a
man
standing
with
his
back
towards
us
looking
at
a
wall
map
a
very
big
man
with
a
neck
that
bulged
over
his
collar
i
would
have
known
that
neck
among
a
million
at
the
sight
of
it
i
made
a
to
bolt
back
it
was
too
late
for
the
door
had
closed
behind
us
and
there
were
two
armed
sentries
beside
it
the
man
slewed
round
and
looked
into
my
eyes
i
had
a
despairing
hope
that
i
might
bluff
it
out
for
i
was
in
different
clothes
and
had
shaved
my
beard
but
you
can
not
spend
ten
minutes
in
a
without
your
adversary
getting
to
know
you
he
went
very
pale
then
recollected
himself
and
twisted
his
features
into
the
old
grin
he
said
little
dutchmen
we
meet
after
many
days
it
was
no
good
lying
or
saying
anything
i
shut
my
teeth
and
waited
you
herr
blenkiron
i
never
liked
the
look
of
you
you
babbled
too
much
like
all
your
damned
americans
guess
your
personal
dislikes
have
got
anything
to
do
with
the
matter
said
blenkiron
calmly
you
the
boss
here
i
thank
you
to
cast
your
eye
over
these
passports
for
we
ca
stand
waiting
for
ever
this
fairly
angered
him
teach
you
manners
he
cried
and
took
a
step
forward
to
reach
for
blenkiron
shoulder
the
game
he
had
twice
played
with
me
blenkiron
never
took
his
hands
from
his
coat
pockets
your
distance
he
drawled
in
a
new
voice
got
you
covered
and
make
a
hole
in
your
bullet
head
if
you
lay
a
hand
on
me
with
an
effort
stumm
recovered
himself
he
rang
a
bell
and
fell
to
smiling
an
orderly
appeared
to
whom
he
spoke
in
turkish
and
presently
a
file
of
soldiers
entered
the
room
going
to
have
you
disarmed
gentlemen
he
said
can
conduct
our
conversation
more
pleasantly
without
pistols
it
was
idle
to
resist
we
surrendered
our
arms
peter
almost
in
tears
with
vexation
stumm
swung
his
legs
over
a
chair
rested
his
chin
on
the
back
and
looked
at
me
game
is
up
you
know
he
said
fools
of
turkish
police
said
the
dutchmen
were
dead
but
i
had
the
happier
inspiration
i
believed
the
good
god
had
spared
them
for
me
when
i
got
telegram
i
was
certain
for
your
doings
reminded
me
of
a
little
trick
you
once
played
me
on
the
schwandorf
road
but
i
did
think
to
find
this
plump
old
partridge
and
he
smiled
at
blenkiron
eminent
american
engineers
and
their
servant
bound
for
mesopotamia
on
business
of
high
government
importance
it
was
a
good
lie
but
if
i
had
been
in
constantinople
it
would
have
had
a
short
life
rasta
and
his
friends
are
no
concern
of
mine
you
can
trick
them
as
you
please
but
you
have
attempted
to
win
the
confidence
of
a
certain
lady
and
her
interests
are
mine
likewise
you
have
offended
me
and
i
do
not
forgive
by
god
he
cried
his
voice
growing
shrill
with
passion
the
time
i
have
done
with
you
your
mothers
in
their
graves
will
weep
that
they
ever
bore
you
it
was
blenkiron
who
spoke
his
voice
was
as
level
as
the
of
a
bogus
company
and
it
fell
on
that
turbid
atmosphere
like
acid
on
grease
do
take
no
stock
in
if
you
trying
to
scare
me
by
that
talk
i
guess
you
hit
the
wrong
man
you
like
the
sweep
that
stuck
in
the
chimney
a
bit
too
big
for
your
job
i
reckon
you
a
talent
for
romance
that
just
wasted
in
soldiering
but
if
you
going
to
play
any
ugly
games
on
me
i
like
you
to
know
that
i
an
american
citizen
and
pretty
well
considered
in
my
own
country
and
in
yours
and
you
sweat
blood
for
it
later
that
a
fair
warning
colonel
stumm
i
do
know
what
stumm
plans
were
but
that
speech
of
put
into
his
mind
just
the
needed
amount
of
uncertainty
you
see
he
had
peter
and
me
right
enough
but
he
had
properly
connected
blenkiron
with
us
and
was
afraid
either
to
hit
out
at
all
three
or
to
let
blenkiron
go
it
was
lucky
for
us
that
the
american
had
cut
such
a
dash
in
the
fatherland
is
no
hurry
he
said
blandly
shall
have
long
happy
hours
together
i
going
to
take
you
all
home
with
me
for
i
am
a
hospitable
soul
you
will
be
safer
with
me
than
in
the
town
gaol
for
it
a
trifle
draughty
it
lets
things
in
and
it
might
let
things
out
again
he
gave
an
order
and
we
were
marched
out
each
with
a
soldier
at
his
elbow
the
three
of
us
were
bundled
into
the
back
seat
of
the
car
while
two
men
sat
before
us
with
their
rifles
between
their
knees
one
got
up
behind
on
the
baggage
rack
and
one
sat
beside
chauffeur
packed
like
sardines
we
moved
into
the
bleak
streets
above
which
the
stars
twinkled
in
ribbons
of
sky
hussin
had
disappeared
from
the
face
of
the
earth
and
quite
right
too
he
was
a
good
fellow
but
he
had
no
call
to
mix
himself
up
in
our
troubles
chapter
eighteen
sparrows
on
the
housetops
often
regretted
said
blenkiron
miracles
have
left
off
happening
he
got
no
answer
for
i
was
feeling
the
walls
for
something
in
the
nature
of
a
window
i
reckon
he
went
on
it
wants
a
good
miracle
to
get
us
out
of
this
fix
it
plumb
against
all
my
principles
i
spent
my
life
using
the
talents
god
gave
me
to
keep
things
from
getting
to
the
point
of
rude
violence
and
so
far
succeeded
but
now
you
come
along
major
and
you
hustle
a
respectable
citizen
into
an
aboriginal
it
mighty
indelicate
i
reckon
the
next
move
is
up
to
you
for
i
no
good
at
the
housebreaking
stunt
more
am
i
i
answered
i
hanged
if
i
chuck
up
the
sponge
sandy
somewhere
outside
and
he
got
a
hefty
crowd
at
his
heels
i
simply
could
not
feel
the
despair
which
by
every
law
of
common
sense
was
due
to
the
case
the
guns
had
intoxicated
me
i
could
still
hear
their
deep
voices
though
yards
of
wood
and
stone
separated
us
from
the
upper
air
what
vexed
us
most
was
our
hunger
barring
a
few
mouthfuls
on
the
road
we
had
eaten
nothing
since
the
morning
and
as
our
diet
for
the
past
days
had
not
been
generous
we
had
some
leeway
to
make
up
stumm
had
never
looked
near
us
since
we
were
shoved
into
the
car
we
had
been
brought
to
some
kind
of
house
and
bundled
into
a
place
like
a
it
was
pitch
dark
and
after
feeling
round
the
walls
first
on
my
feet
and
then
on
peter
back
i
decided
that
there
were
no
windows
it
must
have
been
lit
and
ventilated
by
some
lattice
in
the
ceiling
there
was
not
a
stick
of
furniture
in
the
place
nothing
but
a
damp
earth
floor
and
bare
stone
sides
the
door
was
a
relic
of
the
iron
age
and
i
could
hear
the
paces
of
a
sentry
outside
it
when
things
get
to
the
pass
that
nothing
you
can
do
can
better
them
the
only
thing
is
to
live
for
the
moment
all
three
of
us
sought
in
sleep
a
refuge
from
our
empty
stomachs
the
floor
was
the
poorest
kind
of
bed
but
we
rolled
up
our
coats
for
pillows
and
made
the
best
of
it
soon
i
knew
by
peter
regular
breathing
that
he
was
asleep
and
i
presently
followed
him
i
was
awakened
by
a
pressure
below
my
left
ear
i
thought
it
was
peter
for
it
is
the
old
hunter
trick
of
waking
a
man
so
that
he
makes
no
noise
but
another
voice
spoke
it
told
me
that
there
was
no
time
to
lose
and
to
rise
and
follow
and
the
voice
was
the
voice
of
hussin
peter
was
awake
and
we
stirred
blenkiron
out
of
heavy
slumber
we
were
bidden
take
off
our
boots
and
hang
them
by
their
laces
round
our
necks
as
country
boys
do
when
they
want
to
go
barefoot
then
we
tiptoed
to
the
door
which
was
ajar
outside
was
a
passage
with
a
flight
of
steps
at
one
end
which
led
to
the
open
air
on
these
steps
lay
a
faint
shine
of
starlight
and
by
its
help
i
saw
a
man
huddled
up
at
the
foot
of
them
it
was
our
sentry
neatly
and
scientifically
gagged
and
tied
up
the
steps
brought
us
to
a
little
courtyard
about
which
the
walls
of
the
houses
rose
like
cliffs
we
halted
while
hussin
listened
intently
apparently
the
coast
was
clear
and
our
guide
led
us
to
one
side
which
was
clothed
by
a
stout
wooden
trellis
once
it
may
have
supported
but
now
the
plants
were
dead
and
only
withered
tendrils
and
rotten
stumps
remained
it
was
child
play
for
peter
and
me
to
go
up
that
trellis
but
it
was
the
deuce
and
all
for
blenkiron
he
was
in
poor
condition
and
puffed
like
a
grampus
and
he
seemed
to
have
no
sort
of
head
for
heights
but
he
was
as
game
as
a
buffalo
and
started
in
gallantly
till
his
arms
gave
out
and
he
fairly
stuck
so
peter
and
i
went
up
on
each
side
of
him
taking
an
arm
apiece
as
i
had
once
seen
done
to
a
man
with
vertigo
in
the
kloof
chimney
on
table
mountain
i
was
mighty
thankful
when
i
got
him
panting
on
the
top
and
hussin
had
shinned
up
beside
us
we
crawled
along
a
broadish
wall
with
an
inch
or
two
of
powdery
snow
on
it
and
then
up
a
sloping
buttress
on
to
the
flat
roof
of
the
house
it
was
a
miserable
business
for
blenkiron
who
would
certainly
have
fallen
if
he
could
have
seen
what
was
below
him
and
peter
and
i
had
to
stand
to
attention
all
the
time
then
began
a
more
difficult
job
hussin
pointed
out
a
ledge
which
took
us
past
a
stack
of
chimneys
to
another
building
slightly
lower
this
being
the
route
he
fancied
at
that
i
sat
down
resolutely
and
put
on
my
boots
and
the
others
followed
feet
would
be
a
poor
asset
in
this
kind
of
travelling
it
was
a
bad
step
for
blenkiron
and
we
only
got
him
past
it
by
peter
and
i
ourselves
against
the
wall
and
passing
him
in
front
of
us
with
his
face
towards
us
we
had
no
grip
and
if
he
had
stumbled
we
should
all
three
have
been
in
the
courtyard
but
we
got
it
over
and
dropped
as
softly
as
possible
on
to
the
roof
of
the
next
house
hussin
had
his
finger
on
his
lips
and
i
soon
saw
why
for
there
was
a
lighted
window
in
the
wall
we
had
descended
some
imp
prompted
me
to
wait
behind
and
explore
the
others
followed
hussin
and
were
soon
at
the
far
end
of
the
roof
where
a
kind
of
wooden
pavilion
broke
the
line
while
i
tried
to
get
a
look
inside
the
window
was
curtained
and
had
two
folding
sashes
which
clasped
in
the
middle
through
a
gap
in
the
curtain
i
saw
a
little
room
and
a
big
man
sitting
at
a
table
littered
with
papers
i
watched
him
fascinated
as
he
turned
to
consult
some
document
and
made
a
marking
on
the
map
before
him
then
he
suddenly
rose
stretched
himself
cast
a
glance
at
the
window
and
went
out
of
the
room
making
a
great
clatter
in
descending
the
wooden
staircase
he
left
the
door
ajar
and
the
lamp
burning
i
guessed
he
had
gone
to
have
a
look
at
his
prisoners
in
which
case
the
show
was
up
but
what
filled
my
mind
was
an
insane
desire
to
get
a
sight
of
his
map
it
was
one
of
those
mad
impulses
which
utterly
cloud
right
reason
a
thing
independent
of
any
plan
a
crazy
leap
in
the
dark
but
it
was
so
strong
that
i
would
have
pulled
that
window
out
by
its
frame
if
need
be
to
get
to
that
table
there
was
no
need
for
the
flimsy
clasp
gave
at
the
first
pull
and
the
sashes
swung
open
i
scrambled
in
after
listening
for
steps
on
the
stairs
i
crumpled
up
the
map
and
stuck
it
in
my
pocket
as
well
as
the
paper
from
which
i
had
seen
him
copying
very
carefully
i
removed
all
marks
of
my
entry
brushed
away
the
snow
from
the
boards
pulled
back
the
curtain
got
out
and
refastened
the
window
still
there
was
no
sound
of
his
return
then
i
started
off
to
catch
up
the
others
i
found
them
shivering
in
the
roof
pavilion
got
to
move
pretty
fast
i
said
i
just
been
burgling
old
stumm
private
cabinet
hussin
my
lad
hear
that
they
may
be
after
us
any
moment
so
i
pray
heaven
we
soon
strike
better
going
hussin
understood
he
led
us
at
a
smart
pace
from
one
roof
to
another
for
here
they
were
all
of
the
same
height
and
only
low
parapets
and
screens
divided
them
we
never
saw
a
soul
for
a
winter
night
is
not
the
time
you
choose
to
saunter
on
your
housetop
i
kept
my
ears
open
for
trouble
behind
us
and
in
about
five
minutes
i
heard
it
a
riot
of
voices
broke
out
with
one
louder
than
the
rest
and
looking
back
i
saw
lanterns
waving
stumm
had
realized
his
loss
and
found
the
tracks
of
the
thief
hussin
gave
one
glance
behind
and
then
hurried
us
on
at
pace
with
old
blenkiron
gasping
and
stumbling
the
shouts
behind
us
grew
louder
as
if
some
eye
quicker
than
the
rest
had
caught
our
movement
in
the
starlit
darkness
it
was
very
evident
that
if
they
kept
up
the
chase
we
should
be
caught
for
blenkiron
was
about
as
useful
on
a
roof
as
a
hippo
presently
we
came
to
a
big
drop
with
a
kind
of
ladder
down
it
and
at
the
foot
a
shallow
ledge
running
to
the
left
into
a
pit
of
darkness
hussin
gripped
my
arm
and
pointed
down
it
it
he
whispered
you
will
reach
a
roof
which
spans
a
street
cross
it
and
on
the
other
side
is
a
mosque
turn
to
the
right
there
and
you
will
find
easy
going
for
fifty
metres
well
screened
from
the
higher
roofs
for
allah
sake
keep
in
the
shelter
of
the
screen
somewhere
there
i
will
join
you
he
hurried
us
along
the
ledge
for
a
bit
and
then
went
back
and
with
snow
from
the
corners
covered
up
our
tracks
after
that
he
went
straight
on
himself
taking
strange
short
steps
like
a
bird
i
saw
his
game
he
wanted
to
lead
our
pursuers
after
him
and
he
had
to
multiply
the
tracks
and
trust
to
stumm
fellows
not
spotting
that
they
all
were
made
by
one
man
but
i
had
quite
enough
to
think
of
in
getting
blenkiron
along
that
ledge
he
was
pretty
nearly
foundered
he
was
in
a
sweat
of
terror
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
taking
one
of
the
biggest
risks
of
his
life
for
we
had
no
rope
and
his
neck
depended
on
himself
i
could
hear
him
invoking
some
unknown
deity
called
holy
mike
but
he
ventured
gallantly
and
we
got
to
the
roof
which
ran
across
the
street
that
was
easier
though
ticklish
enough
but
it
was
no
joke
skirting
the
cupola
of
that
infernal
mosque
at
last
we
found
the
parapet
and
breathed
more
freely
for
we
were
now
under
shelter
from
the
direction
of
danger
i
spared
a
moment
to
look
round
and
thirty
yards
off
across
the
street
i
saw
a
weird
spectacle
the
hunt
was
proceeding
along
the
roofs
parallel
to
the
one
we
were
lodged
on
i
saw
the
flicker
of
the
lanterns
waved
up
and
down
as
the
bearers
slipped
in
the
snow
and
i
heard
their
cries
like
hounds
on
a
trail
stumm
was
not
among
them
he
had
not
the
shape
for
that
sort
of
business
they
passed
us
and
continued
to
our
left
now
hid
by
a
jutting
chimney
now
clear
to
view
against
the
sky
line
the
roofs
they
were
on
were
perhaps
six
feet
higher
than
ours
so
even
from
our
shelter
we
could
mark
their
course
if
hussin
were
going
to
be
hunted
across
erzerum
it
was
a
bad
for
us
for
i
had
the
foggiest
notion
where
we
were
or
where
we
were
going
to
but
as
we
watched
we
saw
something
more
the
wavering
lanterns
were
now
three
or
four
hundred
yards
away
but
on
the
roofs
just
opposite
us
across
the
street
there
appeared
a
man
figure
i
thought
it
was
one
of
the
hunters
and
we
all
crouched
lower
and
then
i
recognized
the
lean
agility
of
hussin
he
must
have
doubled
back
keeping
in
the
dusk
to
the
left
of
the
pursuit
and
taking
big
risks
in
the
open
places
but
there
he
was
now
exactly
in
front
of
us
and
separated
only
by
the
width
of
the
narrow
street
he
took
a
step
backward
gathered
himself
for
a
spring
and
leaped
clean
over
the
gap
like
a
cat
he
lighted
on
the
parapet
above
us
and
stumbled
forward
with
the
impetus
right
on
our
heads
are
safe
for
the
moment
he
whispered
when
they
miss
me
they
will
return
we
must
make
good
haste
the
next
was
a
maze
of
twists
and
turns
slipping
down
icy
roofs
and
climbing
icier
the
stir
of
the
city
had
gone
and
from
the
black
streets
below
came
scarcely
a
sound
but
always
the
great
tattoo
of
guns
beat
in
the
east
gradually
we
descended
to
a
lower
level
till
we
emerged
on
the
top
of
a
shed
in
a
courtyard
hussin
gave
an
odd
sort
of
cry
like
a
demented
owl
and
something
began
to
stir
below
us
it
was
a
big
covered
wagon
full
of
bundles
of
forage
and
drawn
by
four
mules
as
we
descended
from
the
shed
into
the
frozen
litter
of
the
yard
a
man
came
out
of
the
shade
and
spoke
low
to
hussin
peter
and
i
lifted
blenkiron
into
the
cart
and
scrambled
in
beside
him
and
i
never
felt
anything
more
blessed
than
the
warmth
and
softness
of
that
place
after
the
frosty
roofs
i
had
forgotten
all
about
my
hunger
and
only
yearned
for
sleep
presently
the
wagon
moved
out
of
the
courtyard
into
the
dark
streets
then
blenkiron
began
to
laugh
a
deep
internal
rumble
which
shook
him
violently
and
brought
down
a
heap
of
forage
on
his
head
i
thought
it
was
hysterics
the
relief
from
the
tension
of
the
past
hour
but
it
was
his
body
might
be
out
of
training
but
there
was
never
anything
the
matter
with
his
nerves
he
was
consumed
with
honest
merriment
major
he
gasped
do
usually
cherish
dislikes
for
my
fellow
men
but
somehow
i
did
cotton
to
colonel
stumm
but
now
i
almost
love
him
you
hit
his
jaw
very
bad
in
germany
and
now
annexed
his
private
file
and
i
guess
it
important
or
he
have
been
so
mighty
set
on
over
those
roofs
i
done
such
a
thing
since
i
broke
into
neighbour
brown
woodshed
to
steal
his
tame
and
that
forty
years
back
it
the
first
piece
of
genooine
amusement
i
struck
in
this
game
and
i
laughed
so
much
since
old
jim
hooker
told
the
tale
of
cousin
sally
dillard
when
we
were
hunting
ducks
in
michigan
and
his
wife
brother
had
an
apoplexy
in
the
night
and
died
of
it
to
the
accompaniment
of
blenkiron
chuckles
i
did
what
peter
had
done
in
the
first
minute
and
fell
asleep
when
i
woke
it
was
still
dark
the
wagon
had
stopped
in
a
courtyard
which
seemed
to
be
shaded
by
great
trees
the
snow
lay
deeper
here
and
by
the
feel
of
the
air
we
had
left
the
city
and
climbed
to
higher
ground
there
were
big
buildings
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
what
looked
like
the
lift
of
a
hill
no
lights
were
shown
the
place
was
in
profound
gloom
but
i
felt
the
presence
near
me
of
others
besides
hussin
and
the
driver
we
were
hurried
blenkiron
only
half
awake
into
an
outbuilding
and
then
down
some
steps
to
a
roomy
cellar
there
hussin
lit
a
lantern
which
showed
what
had
once
been
a
storehouse
for
fruit
old
husks
still
strewed
the
floor
and
the
place
smelt
of
apples
straw
had
been
piled
in
corners
for
beds
and
there
was
a
rude
table
and
a
divan
of
boards
covered
with
sheepskins
are
we
i
asked
hussin
the
house
of
the
master
he
said
will
be
safe
here
but
you
must
keep
still
till
the
master
comes
the
frankish
lady
here
i
asked
hussin
nodded
and
from
a
wallet
brought
out
some
food
raisins
and
cold
meat
and
a
loaf
of
bread
we
fell
on
it
like
vultures
and
as
we
ate
hussin
disappeared
i
noticed
that
he
locked
the
door
behind
him
as
soon
as
the
meal
was
ended
the
others
returned
to
their
interrupted
sleep
but
i
was
wakeful
now
and
my
mind
was
on
many
things
i
got
blenkiron
electric
torch
and
lay
down
on
the
divan
to
study
stumm
map
the
first
glance
showed
me
that
i
had
lit
on
a
treasure
it
was
the
staff
map
of
the
erzerum
defences
showing
the
forts
and
the
field
trenches
with
little
notes
scribbled
in
stumm
neat
small
handwriting
i
got
out
the
big
map
which
i
had
taken
from
blenkiron
and
made
out
the
general
lie
of
the
land
i
saw
the
horseshoe
of
deve
boyun
to
the
east
which
the
russian
guns
were
battering
stumm
was
just
like
the
kind
of
squared
artillery
map
we
used
in
france
in
with
spidery
red
lines
showing
the
trenches
but
with
the
difference
that
it
was
the
turkish
trenches
that
were
shown
in
detail
and
the
russian
only
roughly
indicated
the
thing
was
really
a
confidential
plan
of
the
whole
erzerum
and
would
be
worth
untold
gold
to
the
enemy
no
wonder
stumm
had
been
in
a
wax
at
its
loss
the
deve
boyun
lines
seemed
to
me
monstrously
strong
and
i
remembered
the
merits
of
the
turk
as
a
fighter
behind
strong
defences
it
looked
as
if
russia
were
up
against
a
second
plevna
or
a
new
gallipoli
then
i
took
to
studying
the
flanks
south
lay
the
palantuken
range
of
mountains
with
forts
defending
the
passes
where
ran
the
roads
to
mush
and
lake
van
that
side
too
looked
pretty
strong
north
in
the
valley
of
the
euphrates
i
made
out
two
big
forts
tafta
and
kara
gubek
defending
the
road
from
olti
on
this
part
of
the
map
stumm
notes
were
plentiful
and
i
gave
them
all
my
attention
i
remembered
blenkiron
news
about
the
russians
advancing
on
a
broad
front
for
it
was
clear
that
stumm
was
taking
pains
about
the
flank
of
the
fortress
kara
gubek
was
the
point
of
interest
it
stood
on
a
rib
of
land
between
two
peaks
which
from
the
contour
lines
rose
very
steep
so
long
as
it
was
held
it
was
clear
that
no
invader
could
move
down
the
euphrates
glen
stumm
had
appended
a
note
to
the
peaks
and
about
two
miles
to
the
there
was
a
red
cross
and
the
name
i
assumed
that
to
be
the
farthest
point
yet
reached
by
the
right
wing
of
the
russian
attack
then
i
turned
to
the
paper
from
which
stumm
had
copied
the
jottings
on
to
his
map
it
was
typewritten
and
consisted
of
notes
on
different
points
one
was
headed
and
read
time
to
fortify
adjacent
peaks
difficult
for
enemy
to
get
batteries
there
but
not
impossible
this
the
real
point
of
danger
for
if
prjevalsky
wins
the
peaks
kara
gubek
and
tafta
must
fall
and
enemy
will
be
on
left
rear
of
deve
boyun
main
i
was
soldier
enough
to
see
the
tremendous
importance
of
this
note
on
kara
gubek
depended
the
defence
of
erzerum
and
it
was
a
broken
reed
if
one
knew
where
the
weakness
lay
yet
searching
the
map
again
i
could
not
believe
that
any
mortal
commander
would
see
any
chance
in
the
adjacent
peaks
even
if
he
thought
them
unfortified
that
was
information
confined
to
the
turkish
and
german
staff
but
if
it
could
be
conveyed
to
the
grand
duke
he
would
have
erzerum
in
his
power
in
a
day
otherwise
he
would
go
on
battering
at
the
deve
boyun
ridge
for
weeks
and
long
ere
he
won
it
the
gallipoli
divisions
would
arrive
he
would
be
by
two
to
one
and
his
chance
would
have
vanished
my
discovery
set
me
pacing
up
and
down
that
cellar
in
a
perfect
fever
of
excitement
i
longed
for
wireless
a
carrier
pigeon
an
aeroplane
anything
to
bridge
over
that
space
of
half
a
dozen
miles
between
me
and
the
russian
lines
it
was
maddening
to
have
stumbled
on
vital
news
and
to
be
wholly
unable
to
use
it
how
could
three
fugitives
in
a
cellar
with
the
whole
hornet
nest
of
turkey
and
germany
stirred
up
against
them
hope
to
send
this
message
of
life
and
death
i
went
back
to
the
map
and
examined
the
nearest
russian
positions
they
were
carefully
marked
prjevalsky
in
the
north
the
main
force
beyond
deve
boyun
and
the
southern
columns
up
to
the
passes
of
the
palantuken
but
not
yet
across
them
i
could
not
know
which
was
nearest
to
us
till
i
discovered
where
we
were
and
as
i
thought
of
this
i
began
to
see
the
rudiments
of
a
desperate
plan
it
depended
on
peter
now
slumbering
like
a
tired
dog
on
a
couch
of
straw
hussin
had
locked
the
door
and
i
must
wait
for
information
till
he
came
back
but
suddenly
i
noticed
a
trap
in
the
roof
which
had
evidently
been
used
for
raising
and
lowering
the
cellar
stores
it
looked
and
might
be
unbarred
so
i
pulled
the
table
below
it
and
found
that
with
a
little
effort
i
could
raise
the
flap
i
knew
i
was
taking
immense
risks
but
i
was
so
keen
on
my
plan
that
i
disregarded
them
after
some
trouble
i
got
the
thing
prised
open
and
catching
the
edges
of
the
hole
with
my
fingers
raised
my
body
and
got
my
knees
on
the
edge
it
was
the
outbuilding
of
which
our
refuge
was
the
cellar
and
it
was
half
filled
with
light
not
a
soul
was
there
and
i
hunted
about
till
i
found
what
i
wanted
this
was
a
ladder
leading
to
a
sort
of
loft
which
in
turn
gave
access
to
the
roof
here
i
had
to
be
very
careful
for
i
might
be
overlooked
from
the
high
buildings
but
by
good
luck
there
was
a
trellis
for
grape
vines
across
the
place
which
gave
a
kind
of
shelter
lying
flat
on
my
face
i
stared
over
a
great
expanse
of
country
looking
north
i
saw
the
city
in
a
haze
of
morning
smoke
and
beyond
the
plain
of
the
euphrates
and
the
opening
of
the
glen
where
the
river
left
the
hills
up
there
among
the
snowy
heights
were
tafta
and
kara
gubek
to
the
east
was
the
ridge
of
deve
boyun
where
the
mist
was
breaking
before
the
winter
sun
on
the
roads
up
to
it
i
saw
transport
moving
i
saw
the
circle
of
the
inner
forts
but
for
a
moment
the
guns
were
silent
south
rose
a
great
wall
of
white
mountain
which
i
took
to
be
the
palantuken
i
could
see
the
roads
running
to
the
passes
and
the
smoke
of
camps
and
right
under
the
cliffs
i
had
learned
what
i
needed
we
were
in
the
outbuildings
of
a
big
country
house
two
or
three
miles
south
of
the
city
the
nearest
point
of
the
russian
front
was
somewhere
in
the
foothills
of
the
palantuken
as
i
descended
i
heard
thin
and
faint
and
beautiful
like
the
cry
of
a
wild
bird
the
muezzin
from
the
minarets
of
erzerum
when
i
dropped
through
the
trap
the
others
were
awake
hussin
was
setting
food
on
the
table
and
viewing
my
descent
with
anxious
disapproval
all
right
i
said
wo
do
it
again
for
i
found
out
all
i
wanted
peter
old
man
the
biggest
job
of
your
life
is
before
you
chapter
nineteen
greenmantle
peter
scarcely
looked
up
from
his
breakfast
willing
dick
he
said
you
must
ask
me
to
be
friends
with
stumm
he
makes
my
stomach
cold
that
one
for
the
first
time
he
had
stopped
calling
me
the
day
of
was
over
for
all
of
us
to
be
friends
with
him
i
said
to
bust
him
and
all
his
kind
i
ready
said
peter
cheerfully
is
it
i
spread
out
the
maps
on
the
divan
there
was
no
light
in
the
place
but
blenkiron
electric
torch
for
hussin
had
put
out
the
lantern
peter
got
his
nose
into
the
things
at
once
for
his
intelligence
work
in
the
boer
war
had
made
him
handy
with
maps
it
did
want
much
telling
from
me
to
explain
to
him
the
importance
of
the
one
i
had
looted
news
is
worth
many
a
million
pounds
said
he
wrinkling
his
brows
and
scratching
delicately
the
tip
of
his
left
ear
it
was
a
way
he
had
when
he
was
startled
can
we
get
it
to
our
friends
peter
cogitated
is
but
one
way
a
man
must
take
it
once
i
remember
when
we
fought
the
matabele
it
was
necessary
to
find
out
whether
the
chief
makapan
was
living
some
said
he
had
died
others
that
he
gone
over
the
portuguese
border
but
i
believed
he
lived
no
native
could
tell
us
and
since
his
kraal
was
well
defended
no
runner
could
get
through
so
it
was
necessary
to
send
a
man
peter
lifted
up
his
head
and
laughed
man
found
the
chief
makapan
he
was
very
much
alive
and
made
good
shooting
with
a
but
the
man
brought
the
chief
makapan
out
of
his
kraal
and
handed
him
over
to
the
mounted
police
you
remember
captain
arcoll
dick
jim
arcoll
well
jim
laughed
so
much
that
he
broke
open
a
wound
in
his
head
and
had
to
have
a
doctor
were
that
man
peter
i
said
i
was
the
man
there
are
more
ways
of
getting
into
kraals
than
there
are
ways
of
keeping
people
out
you
take
this
chance
certain
dick
i
am
getting
stiff
with
doing
nothing
and
if
i
sit
in
houses
much
longer
i
shall
grow
old
a
man
bet
me
five
pounds
on
the
ship
that
i
could
not
get
through
a
and
if
there
had
been
a
handy
i
would
have
taken
him
on
i
will
be
very
happy
dick
but
i
do
not
say
i
will
succeed
it
is
new
country
to
me
and
i
will
be
hurried
and
hurry
makes
bad
stalking
i
showed
him
what
i
thought
the
likeliest
place
in
the
spurs
of
the
palantuken
mountains
peter
way
of
doing
things
was
all
his
own
he
scraped
earth
and
plaster
out
of
a
corner
and
sat
down
to
make
a
little
model
of
the
landscape
on
the
table
following
the
contours
of
the
map
he
did
it
extraordinarily
neatly
for
like
all
great
hunters
he
was
as
deft
as
a
weaver
bird
he
puzzled
over
it
for
a
long
time
and
conned
the
map
till
he
must
have
got
it
by
heart
then
he
took
his
a
very
good
single
zeiss
which
was
part
of
the
spoils
from
rasta
and
announced
that
he
was
going
to
follow
my
example
and
get
on
to
the
presently
his
legs
disappeared
through
the
trap
and
blenkiron
and
i
were
left
to
our
reflections
peter
must
have
found
something
uncommon
interesting
for
he
stayed
on
the
roof
the
better
part
of
the
day
it
was
a
dull
job
for
us
since
there
was
no
light
and
blenkiron
had
not
even
the
consolation
of
a
game
of
patience
but
for
all
that
he
was
in
good
spirits
for
he
had
had
no
dyspepsia
since
we
left
constantinople
and
announced
that
he
believed
he
was
at
last
getting
even
with
his
darned
duodenum
as
for
me
i
was
pretty
restless
for
i
could
not
imagine
what
was
detaining
sandy
it
was
clear
that
our
presence
must
have
been
kept
secret
from
hilda
von
einem
for
she
was
a
pal
of
stumm
and
he
must
by
now
have
blown
the
gaff
on
peter
and
me
how
long
could
this
secrecy
last
i
asked
myself
we
had
now
no
sort
of
protection
in
the
whole
outfit
rasta
and
the
turks
wanted
our
blood
so
did
stumm
and
the
germans
and
once
the
lady
found
we
were
deceiving
her
she
would
want
it
most
of
all
our
only
hope
was
sandy
and
he
gave
no
sign
of
his
existence
i
began
to
fear
that
with
him
too
things
had
miscarried
and
yet
i
was
really
depressed
only
impatient
i
could
never
again
get
back
to
the
beastly
stagnation
of
that
constantinople
week
the
guns
kept
me
cheerful
there
was
the
devil
of
a
bombardment
all
day
and
the
thought
that
our
allies
were
thundering
there
half
a
dozen
miles
off
gave
me
a
perfectly
groundless
hope
if
they
burst
through
the
defence
hilda
von
einem
and
her
prophet
and
all
our
enemies
would
be
overwhelmed
in
the
deluge
and
that
blessed
chance
depended
very
much
on
old
peter
now
brooding
like
a
pigeon
on
the
it
was
not
till
the
late
afternoon
that
hussin
appeared
again
he
took
no
notice
of
peter
absence
but
lit
a
lantern
and
set
it
on
the
table
then
he
went
to
the
door
and
waited
presently
a
light
step
fell
on
the
stairs
and
hussin
drew
back
to
let
someone
enter
he
promptly
departed
and
i
heard
the
key
turn
in
the
lock
behind
him
sandy
stood
there
but
a
new
sandy
who
made
blenkiron
and
me
jump
to
our
feet
the
pelts
and
had
gone
and
he
wore
instead
a
long
linen
tunic
clasped
at
the
waist
by
a
broad
girdle
a
strange
green
turban
adorned
his
head
and
as
he
pushed
it
back
i
saw
that
his
hair
had
been
shaved
he
looked
like
some
acolyte
a
weary
acolyte
for
there
was
no
spring
in
his
walk
or
nerve
in
his
carriage
he
dropped
numbly
on
the
divan
and
laid
his
head
in
his
hands
the
lantern
showed
his
haggard
eyes
with
dark
lines
beneath
them
god
old
man
have
you
been
sick
i
cried
sick
he
said
hoarsely
body
is
right
enough
but
the
last
few
days
i
have
been
living
in
hell
blenkiron
nodded
sympathetically
that
was
how
he
himself
would
have
described
the
company
of
the
lady
i
marched
across
to
him
and
gripped
both
his
wrists
at
me
i
said
in
the
eyes
his
eyes
were
like
a
unwinking
unseeing
heavens
man
you
been
drugged
i
said
he
cried
with
a
weary
laugh
i
have
been
drugged
but
not
by
any
physic
no
one
has
been
doctoring
my
food
but
you
ca
go
through
hell
without
getting
your
eyes
i
kept
my
grip
on
his
wrists
your
time
old
chap
and
tell
us
about
it
blenkiron
and
i
are
here
and
old
peter
on
the
roof
not
far
off
we
look
after
you
does
me
good
to
hear
your
voice
dick
he
said
reminds
me
of
clean
honest
things
come
back
never
fear
we
at
the
last
lap
now
one
more
spurt
and
it
over
you
got
to
tell
me
what
the
new
snag
is
is
it
that
woman
he
shivered
like
a
frightened
colt
he
cried
a
woman
drag
a
man
through
the
she
a
oh
it
madness
that
wrong
with
her
she
as
sane
as
you
and
as
cool
as
blenkiron
her
life
is
an
infernal
game
of
chess
and
she
plays
with
souls
for
pawns
she
is
evil
evil
evil
and
once
more
he
buried
his
head
in
his
hands
it
was
blenkiron
who
brought
sense
into
this
hectic
atmosphere
his
slow
beloved
drawl
was
an
antiseptic
against
nerves
boy
he
said
feel
just
like
you
about
the
lady
but
our
job
is
not
to
investigate
her
character
her
maker
will
do
that
good
and
sure
some
day
we
got
to
figure
how
to
circumvent
her
and
for
that
you
got
to
tell
us
what
exactly
been
occurring
since
we
parted
company
sandy
pulled
himself
together
with
a
great
effort
died
that
night
i
saw
you
we
buried
him
secretly
by
her
order
in
the
garden
of
the
villa
then
came
the
trouble
about
his
successor
the
four
ministers
would
be
no
party
to
a
swindle
they
were
honest
men
and
vowed
that
their
task
now
was
to
make
a
tomb
for
their
master
and
pray
for
the
rest
of
their
days
at
his
shrine
they
were
as
immovable
as
a
granite
hill
and
she
knew
it
then
they
too
died
i
gasped
all
four
in
one
morning
i
do
not
know
how
but
i
helped
to
bury
them
oh
she
had
germans
and
kurds
to
do
her
foul
work
but
their
hands
were
clean
compared
to
hers
pity
me
dick
for
i
have
seen
honesty
and
virtue
put
to
the
shambles
and
have
abetted
the
deed
when
it
was
done
it
will
haunt
me
to
my
dying
day
i
did
not
stop
to
console
him
for
my
mind
was
on
fire
with
his
news
the
prophet
is
gone
and
the
humbug
is
over
i
cried
prophet
still
lives
she
has
found
a
successor
he
stood
up
in
his
linen
tunic
do
i
wear
these
clothes
because
i
am
greenmantle
i
am
the
for
all
islam
in
three
days
time
i
will
reveal
myself
to
my
people
and
wear
on
my
breast
the
green
ephod
of
the
prophet
he
broke
off
with
an
hysterical
laugh
you
see
i
wo
i
will
cut
my
throat
first
up
said
blenkiron
soothingly
find
some
prettier
way
than
that
is
no
way
he
said
way
but
death
we
done
for
all
of
us
hussin
got
you
out
of
stumm
clutches
but
you
in
danger
every
moment
at
the
best
you
have
three
days
and
then
you
too
will
be
dead
i
had
no
words
to
reply
this
change
in
the
bold
and
unshakeable
sandy
took
my
breath
away
made
me
her
accomplice
he
went
on
should
have
killed
her
on
the
graves
of
those
innocent
men
but
instead
i
did
all
she
asked
and
joined
in
her
game
she
was
very
candid
you
know
she
cares
no
more
than
enver
for
the
faith
of
islam
she
can
laugh
at
it
but
she
has
her
own
dreams
and
they
consume
her
as
a
saint
is
consumed
by
his
devotion
she
has
told
me
them
and
if
the
day
in
the
garden
was
hell
the
days
since
have
been
the
innermost
fires
of
tophet
i
think
it
is
horrible
to
say
it
that
she
has
got
some
kind
of
crazy
liking
for
me
when
we
have
reclaimed
the
east
i
am
to
be
by
her
side
when
she
rides
on
her
horse
into
jerusalem
and
there
have
been
moments
only
moments
i
swear
to
god
when
i
have
been
fired
myself
by
her
madness
sandy
figure
seemed
to
shrink
and
his
voice
grew
shrill
and
wild
it
was
too
much
for
blenkiron
he
indulged
in
a
torrent
of
blasphemy
such
as
i
believe
had
never
before
passed
his
lips
blessed
if
i
listen
to
this
stuff
it
delicate
you
get
busy
major
and
pump
some
sense
into
your
afflicted
friend
i
was
beginning
to
see
what
had
happened
sandy
was
a
man
of
genius
as
much
as
anybody
i
ever
struck
but
he
had
the
defects
of
such
fanciful
souls
he
would
take
more
than
mortal
risks
and
you
could
scare
him
by
any
ordinary
terror
but
let
his
old
conscience
get
let
him
find
himself
in
some
situation
which
in
his
eyes
involved
his
honour
and
he
might
go
stark
crazy
the
woman
who
roused
in
me
and
blenkiron
only
hatred
could
catch
his
imagination
and
stir
in
him
for
the
moment
only
an
unwilling
response
and
then
came
bitter
and
morbid
repentance
and
the
last
desperation
it
was
no
time
to
mince
matters
you
old
fool
i
cried
thankful
you
have
friends
to
keep
you
from
playing
the
fool
you
saved
my
life
at
loos
and
i
jolly
well
going
to
get
you
through
this
show
i
bossing
the
outfit
now
and
for
all
your
confounded
prophetic
manners
you
got
to
take
your
orders
from
me
you
are
going
to
reveal
yourself
to
your
people
and
still
less
are
you
going
to
cut
your
throat
greenmantle
will
avenge
the
murder
of
his
ministers
and
make
that
bedlamite
woman
sorry
she
was
born
we
going
to
get
clear
away
and
inside
of
a
week
we
be
having
tea
with
the
grand
duke
nicholas
i
was
bluffing
puzzled
as
i
was
about
ways
and
means
i
had
still
the
blind
belief
that
we
should
win
out
and
as
i
spoke
two
legs
dangled
through
the
trap
and
a
dusty
and
blinking
peter
descended
in
our
midst
i
took
the
maps
from
him
and
spread
them
on
the
table
you
must
know
that
we
had
an
almighty
piece
of
luck
last
night
hussin
took
us
for
a
walk
over
the
roofs
of
erzerum
and
by
the
blessing
of
providence
i
got
into
stumm
room
and
bagged
his
staff
map
look
there
see
his
notes
that
the
of
the
whole
defence
once
the
russians
get
that
fort
kara
gubek
they
turned
the
main
position
and
it
can
be
got
stumm
knows
it
can
for
these
two
adjacent
hills
are
not
held
it
looks
a
mad
enterprise
on
paper
but
stumm
knows
that
it
is
possible
enough
the
question
is
will
the
russians
guess
that
i
say
no
not
unless
someone
tells
them
therefore
by
hook
or
by
crook
we
got
to
get
that
information
through
to
them
sandy
interest
in
ordinary
things
was
beginning
to
flicker
up
again
he
studied
the
map
and
began
to
measure
distances
going
to
have
a
try
for
it
he
thinks
there
a
sporting
chance
of
his
getting
through
the
lines
if
he
does
if
he
gets
this
map
to
the
grand
duke
staff
then
stumm
goose
is
cooked
in
three
days
the
cossacks
will
be
in
the
streets
of
erzerum
are
the
chances
sandy
asked
i
glanced
at
peter
fellows
and
can
face
the
truth
i
think
the
chances
against
success
are
about
five
to
one
to
one
said
peter
modestly
worse
than
that
i
think
you
fair
to
me
dick
my
old
friend
i
looked
at
that
lean
tight
figure
and
the
gentle
resolute
face
and
i
changed
my
mind
hanged
if
i
think
there
are
any
odds
i
said
anybody
else
it
would
want
a
miracle
but
with
peter
i
believe
the
chances
are
level
to
one
peter
persisted
it
was
evens
i
would
be
interested
me
go
sandy
cried
talk
the
lingo
and
can
pass
as
a
turk
and
i
a
million
times
likelier
to
get
through
for
god
sake
dick
let
me
go
you
you
wanted
here
if
you
disappear
the
whole
busted
too
soon
and
the
three
of
us
left
behind
will
be
strung
up
before
morning
no
my
son
you
going
to
escape
but
it
will
be
in
company
with
blenkiron
and
me
we
got
to
blow
the
whole
greenmantle
business
so
high
that
the
bits
of
it
will
never
come
to
earth
again
first
tell
me
how
many
of
your
fellows
will
stick
by
you
i
mean
the
companions
whole
they
are
very
worried
already
about
what
has
happened
she
made
me
sound
them
in
her
presence
and
they
were
quite
ready
to
accept
me
as
greenmantle
successor
but
they
have
their
suspicions
about
what
happened
at
the
villa
and
they
no
love
for
the
woman
they
follow
me
through
hell
if
i
bade
them
but
they
would
rather
it
was
my
own
show
all
right
i
cried
is
the
one
thing
i
been
doubtful
about
now
observe
this
map
erzerum
is
invested
by
a
long
chalk
the
russians
are
round
it
in
a
broad
that
means
that
all
the
west
and
is
open
and
undefended
by
trench
lines
there
are
flanks
far
away
to
the
north
and
south
in
the
hills
which
can
be
turned
and
once
we
get
round
a
flank
there
nothing
between
us
and
our
friends
i
figured
out
our
road
and
i
traced
it
on
the
map
we
can
make
that
big
circuit
to
the
west
and
get
over
that
pass
unobserved
we
bound
to
strike
a
russian
column
the
next
day
it
be
a
rough
road
but
i
fancy
we
all
ridden
as
bad
in
our
time
but
one
thing
we
must
have
and
that
horses
can
we
and
your
six
ruffians
slip
off
in
the
darkness
on
the
best
beasts
in
this
township
if
you
can
manage
that
we
do
the
trick
sandy
sat
down
and
pondered
thank
heaven
he
was
thinking
now
of
action
and
not
of
his
own
conscience
must
be
done
he
said
at
last
it
wo
be
easy
hussin
a
great
fellow
but
as
you
know
well
dick
horses
right
up
at
the
are
not
easy
to
come
by
tomorrow
i
got
some
kind
of
infernal
fast
to
observe
and
the
next
day
that
woman
will
be
coaching
me
for
my
part
we
have
to
give
hussin
time
i
wish
to
heaven
it
could
be
tonight
he
was
silent
again
for
a
bit
and
then
he
said
believe
the
best
time
would
be
the
third
night
the
eve
of
the
revelation
she
bound
to
leave
me
alone
that
night
i
said
wo
be
much
fun
sitting
waiting
in
this
cold
sepulchre
but
we
must
keep
our
heads
and
risk
nothing
by
being
in
a
hurry
besides
if
peter
wins
through
the
turk
will
be
a
busy
man
by
the
day
after
tomorrow
the
key
turned
in
the
door
and
hussin
stole
in
like
a
shade
it
was
the
signal
for
sandy
to
leave
fellows
have
given
me
a
new
lease
of
life
he
said
got
a
plan
now
and
i
can
set
my
teeth
and
stick
it
out
he
went
up
to
peter
and
gripped
his
hand
luck
you
the
bravest
man
i
ever
met
and
i
seen
a
few
then
he
turned
abruptly
and
went
out
followed
by
an
exhortation
from
blenkiron
to
busy
about
the
quadrupeds
then
we
set
about
equipping
peter
for
his
crusade
it
was
a
simple
job
for
we
were
not
rich
in
properties
his
with
his
thick
greatcoat
was
not
unlike
the
ordinary
turkish
officer
seen
in
a
dim
light
but
peter
had
no
intention
of
passing
for
a
turk
or
indeed
of
giving
anybody
the
chance
of
seeing
him
and
he
was
more
concerned
to
fit
in
with
the
landscape
so
he
stripped
off
the
greatcoat
and
pulled
a
grey
sweater
of
mine
over
his
jacket
and
put
on
his
head
a
woollen
helmet
of
the
same
colour
he
had
no
need
of
the
map
for
he
had
long
since
got
his
route
by
heart
and
what
was
once
fixed
in
that
mind
stuck
like
wax
but
i
made
him
take
stumm
plan
and
paper
hidden
below
his
shirt
the
big
difficulty
i
saw
would
be
getting
to
the
russians
without
getting
shot
assuming
he
passed
the
turkish
trenches
he
could
only
hope
that
he
would
strike
someone
with
a
smattering
of
english
or
german
twice
he
ascended
to
the
roof
and
came
back
cheerful
for
there
was
promise
of
wild
weather
hussin
brought
in
our
supper
and
peter
made
up
a
parcel
of
food
blenkiron
and
i
had
both
small
flasks
of
brandy
and
i
gave
him
mine
then
he
held
out
his
hand
quite
simply
like
a
good
child
who
is
going
off
to
bed
it
was
too
much
for
blenkiron
with
large
tears
rolling
down
his
face
he
announced
that
if
we
all
came
through
he
was
going
to
fit
him
into
the
softest
berth
that
money
could
buy
i
do
think
he
was
understood
for
old
peter
eyes
had
now
the
faraway
absorption
of
the
hunter
who
has
found
game
he
was
thinking
only
of
his
job
two
legs
and
a
pair
of
very
shabby
boots
vanished
through
the
trap
and
suddenly
i
felt
utterly
lonely
and
desperately
sad
the
guns
were
beginning
to
roar
again
in
the
east
and
in
the
intervals
came
the
whistle
of
the
rising
storm
chapter
twenty
peter
pienaar
goes
to
the
wars
this
chapter
is
the
tale
that
peter
told
me
long
after
sitting
beside
a
stove
in
the
hotel
at
bergen
where
we
were
waiting
for
our
boat
he
climbed
on
the
roof
and
shinned
down
the
broken
bricks
of
the
outer
wall
the
outbuilding
we
were
lodged
in
abutted
on
a
road
and
was
outside
the
proper
of
the
house
at
ordinary
times
i
have
no
doubt
there
were
sentries
but
sandy
and
hussin
had
probably
managed
to
clear
them
off
this
end
for
a
little
anyhow
he
saw
nobody
as
he
crossed
the
road
and
dived
into
the
snowy
fields
he
knew
very
well
that
he
must
do
the
job
in
the
twelve
hours
of
darkness
ahead
of
him
the
immediate
front
of
a
battle
is
a
bit
too
public
for
anyone
to
lie
hidden
in
by
day
especially
when
two
or
three
feet
of
snow
make
everything
kenspeckle
now
hurry
in
a
job
of
this
kind
was
abhorrent
to
peter
soul
for
like
all
boers
his
tastes
were
for
slowness
and
sureness
though
he
could
hustle
fast
enough
when
haste
was
needed
as
he
pushed
through
the
winter
fields
he
reckoned
up
the
things
in
his
favour
and
found
the
only
one
the
dirty
weather
there
was
a
high
gusty
wind
blowing
scuds
of
snow
but
never
coming
to
any
great
fall
the
frost
had
gone
and
the
lying
snow
was
as
soft
as
butter
that
was
all
to
the
good
he
thought
for
a
clear
hard
night
would
have
been
the
devil
the
first
bit
was
through
farmlands
which
were
seamed
with
little
now
and
then
would
come
a
house
and
a
patch
of
fruit
trees
but
there
was
nobody
abroad
the
roads
were
crowded
enough
but
peter
had
no
use
for
roads
i
can
picture
him
swinging
along
with
his
bent
back
stopping
every
now
and
then
to
sniff
and
listen
alert
for
the
foreknowledge
of
danger
when
he
chose
he
could
cover
country
like
an
antelope
soon
he
struck
a
big
road
full
of
transport
it
was
the
road
from
erzerum
to
the
palantuken
pass
and
he
waited
his
chance
and
crossed
it
after
that
the
ground
grew
rough
with
boulders
and
patches
of
splendid
cover
where
he
could
move
fast
without
worrying
then
he
was
pulled
up
suddenly
on
the
bank
of
a
river
the
map
had
warned
him
of
it
but
not
that
it
would
be
so
big
it
was
a
torrent
swollen
with
melting
snow
and
rains
in
the
hills
and
it
was
running
fifty
yards
wide
peter
thought
he
could
have
swum
it
but
he
was
very
averse
to
a
drenching
wet
man
makes
too
much
noise
he
said
and
besides
there
was
the
that
the
current
would
be
too
much
for
him
so
he
moved
up
stream
to
look
for
a
bridge
in
ten
minutes
he
found
one
a
thing
of
trestles
broad
enough
to
take
transport
wagons
it
was
guarded
for
he
heard
the
tramp
of
a
sentry
and
as
he
pulled
himself
up
the
bank
he
observed
a
couple
of
long
wooden
huts
obviously
some
kind
of
billets
these
were
on
the
near
side
of
the
stream
about
a
dozen
yards
from
the
bridge
a
door
stood
open
and
a
light
showed
in
it
and
from
within
came
the
sound
of
voices
peter
had
a
sense
of
hearing
like
a
wild
animal
and
he
could
detect
even
from
the
confused
gabble
that
the
voices
were
german
as
he
lay
and
listened
someone
came
over
the
bridge
it
was
an
officer
for
the
sentry
saluted
the
man
disappeared
in
one
of
the
huts
peter
had
struck
the
billets
and
repairing
shop
of
a
squad
of
german
sappers
he
was
just
going
ruefully
to
retrace
his
steps
and
try
to
find
a
good
place
to
swim
the
stream
when
it
struck
him
that
the
officer
who
had
passed
him
wore
clothes
very
like
his
own
he
too
had
had
a
grey
sweater
and
a
balaclava
helmet
for
even
a
german
officer
ceases
to
be
dressy
on
a
night
in
anatolia
the
idea
came
to
peter
to
walk
boldly
across
the
bridge
and
trust
to
the
sentry
not
seeing
the
difference
he
slipped
round
a
corner
of
the
hut
and
marched
down
the
road
the
sentry
was
now
at
the
far
end
which
was
lucky
for
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
he
could
throttle
him
peter
mimicking
the
stiff
german
walk
swung
past
him
his
head
down
as
if
to
protect
him
from
the
wind
the
man
saluted
he
did
more
for
he
offered
conversation
the
officer
must
have
been
a
genial
soul
a
rough
night
captain
he
said
in
german
wagons
are
late
pray
god
michael
has
got
a
shell
in
his
lot
they
begun
putting
over
some
big
ones
peter
grunted
good
night
in
german
and
strode
on
he
was
just
leaving
the
road
when
he
heard
a
great
halloo
behind
him
the
real
officer
must
have
appeared
on
his
heels
and
the
doubts
had
been
stirred
a
whistle
was
blown
and
looking
back
peter
saw
lanterns
waving
in
the
gale
they
were
coming
out
to
look
for
the
duplicate
he
stood
still
for
a
second
and
noticed
the
lights
spreading
out
south
of
the
road
he
was
just
about
to
dive
off
it
on
the
north
side
when
he
was
aware
of
a
difficulty
on
that
side
a
steep
bank
fell
to
a
ditch
and
the
bank
beyond
bounded
a
big
flood
he
could
see
the
dull
ruffle
of
the
water
under
the
wind
on
the
road
itself
he
would
soon
be
caught
south
of
it
the
search
was
beginning
and
the
ditch
itself
was
no
place
to
hide
for
he
saw
a
lantern
moving
up
it
peter
dropped
into
it
all
the
same
and
made
a
plan
the
side
below
the
road
was
a
little
undercut
and
very
steep
he
resolved
to
plaster
himself
against
it
for
he
would
be
hidden
from
the
road
and
a
searcher
in
the
ditch
would
not
be
likely
to
explore
the
unbroken
sides
it
was
always
a
maxim
of
peter
that
the
best
was
the
worst
the
least
obvious
to
the
minds
of
those
who
were
looking
for
you
he
waited
until
the
lights
both
in
the
road
and
the
ditch
came
nearer
and
then
he
gripped
the
edge
with
his
left
hand
where
some
stones
gave
him
purchase
dug
the
toes
of
his
boots
into
the
wet
soil
and
stuck
like
a
limpet
it
needed
some
strength
to
keep
the
position
for
long
but
the
muscles
of
his
arms
and
legs
were
like
whipcord
the
searcher
in
the
ditch
soon
got
tired
for
the
place
was
very
wet
and
joined
his
comrades
on
the
road
they
came
along
running
flashing
the
lanterns
into
the
trench
and
exploring
all
the
immediate
countryside
then
rose
a
noise
of
wheels
and
horses
from
the
opposite
direction
michael
and
the
delayed
wagons
were
approaching
they
dashed
up
at
a
great
pace
driven
wildly
and
for
one
horrid
second
peter
thought
they
were
going
to
spill
into
the
ditch
at
the
very
spot
where
he
was
concealed
the
wheels
passed
so
close
to
the
edge
that
they
almost
grazed
his
fingers
somebody
shouted
an
order
and
they
pulled
up
a
yard
or
two
nearer
the
bridge
the
others
came
up
and
there
was
a
consultation
michael
swore
he
had
passed
no
one
on
the
road
fool
hannus
has
seen
a
ghost
said
the
officer
testily
too
cold
for
this
child
play
hannus
almost
in
tears
repeated
his
tale
man
spoke
to
me
in
good
german
he
cried
or
no
ghost
he
is
safe
enough
up
the
road
said
the
officer
god
that
was
a
big
one
he
stopped
and
stared
at
a
for
the
bombardment
from
the
east
was
growing
fiercer
they
stood
discussing
the
fire
for
a
minute
and
presently
moved
off
peter
gave
them
two
minutes
law
and
then
clambered
back
to
the
highway
and
set
off
along
it
at
a
run
the
noise
of
the
shelling
and
the
wind
together
with
the
thick
darkness
made
it
safe
to
hurry
he
left
the
road
at
the
first
chance
and
took
to
the
broken
country
the
ground
was
now
rising
towards
a
spur
of
the
palantuken
on
the
far
slope
of
which
were
the
turkish
trenches
the
night
had
begun
by
being
pretty
nearly
as
black
as
pitch
even
the
smoke
from
the
shell
explosions
which
is
often
visible
in
darkness
could
not
be
seen
but
as
the
wind
blew
the
athwart
the
sky
patches
of
stars
came
out
peter
had
a
compass
but
he
did
need
to
use
it
for
he
had
a
kind
of
for
landscape
a
special
sense
which
is
born
in
savages
and
can
only
be
acquired
after
long
experience
by
the
white
man
i
believe
he
could
smell
where
the
north
lay
he
had
settled
roughly
which
part
of
the
line
he
would
try
merely
because
of
its
nearness
to
the
enemy
but
he
might
see
reason
to
vary
this
and
as
he
moved
he
began
to
think
that
the
safest
place
was
where
the
shelling
was
hottest
he
did
like
the
notion
but
it
sounded
sense
suddenly
he
began
to
puzzle
over
queer
things
in
the
ground
and
as
he
had
never
seen
big
guns
before
it
took
him
a
moment
to
fix
them
presently
one
went
off
at
his
elbow
with
a
roar
like
the
last
day
these
were
austrian
howitzers
nothing
over
i
fancy
but
to
peter
they
looked
like
leviathans
here
too
he
saw
for
the
first
time
a
big
and
quite
recent
for
the
russian
guns
were
searching
out
the
position
he
was
so
interested
in
it
all
that
he
poked
his
nose
where
he
should
have
been
and
dropped
plump
into
the
pit
behind
a
gunners
all
the
world
over
are
the
same
shy
people
who
hide
themselves
in
holes
and
hibernate
and
mortally
dislike
being
detected
a
gruff
voice
cried
and
a
heavy
hand
seized
his
neck
peter
was
ready
with
his
story
he
belonged
to
michael
and
had
been
left
behind
he
wanted
to
be
told
the
way
to
the
camp
he
was
very
apologetic
not
to
say
obsequious
is
one
of
those
prussian
swine
from
the
marta
bridge
said
a
gunner
him
a
kick
to
teach
him
sense
bear
to
your
right
mannikin
and
you
will
find
a
road
and
have
a
care
when
you
get
there
for
the
russkoes
are
registering
on
it
peter
thanked
them
and
bore
off
to
the
right
after
that
he
kept
a
wary
eye
on
the
howitzers
and
was
thankful
when
he
got
out
of
their
area
on
to
the
slopes
up
the
hill
here
was
the
type
of
country
that
was
familiar
to
him
and
he
defied
any
turk
or
boche
to
spot
him
among
the
scrub
and
boulders
he
was
getting
on
very
well
when
once
more
close
to
his
ear
came
a
sound
like
the
crack
of
doom
it
was
the
now
and
the
sound
of
a
close
at
hand
is
bad
for
the
nerves
if
you
are
expecting
it
peter
thought
he
had
been
hit
and
lay
flat
for
a
little
to
consider
then
he
found
the
right
explanation
and
crawled
forward
very
warily
presently
he
saw
his
first
russian
shell
it
dropped
half
a
dozen
yards
to
his
right
making
a
great
hole
in
the
snow
and
sending
up
a
mass
of
mixed
earth
snow
and
broken
stones
peter
spat
out
the
dirt
and
felt
very
solemn
you
must
remember
that
never
in
his
life
had
he
seen
big
shelling
and
was
now
being
landed
in
the
thick
of
a
show
without
any
preparation
he
said
he
felt
cold
in
his
stomach
and
very
wishful
to
run
away
if
there
had
been
anywhere
to
run
to
but
he
kept
on
to
the
crest
of
the
ridge
over
which
a
big
glow
was
broadening
like
sunrise
he
tripped
once
over
a
wire
which
he
took
for
some
kind
of
snare
and
after
that
went
very
warily
by
and
by
he
got
his
face
between
two
boulders
and
looked
over
into
the
true
he
told
me
it
was
exactly
what
the
predikant
used
to
say
that
hell
would
be
like
about
fifty
yards
down
the
slope
lay
the
turkish
trenches
they
were
dark
against
the
snow
and
now
and
then
a
black
figure
like
a
devil
showed
for
an
instant
and
disappeared
the
turks
clearly
expected
an
infantry
attack
for
they
were
sending
up
calcium
rockets
and
very
flares
the
russians
were
battering
their
line
and
spraying
all
the
hinterland
not
with
shrapnel
but
with
good
solid
the
place
would
be
as
bright
as
day
for
a
moment
all
smothered
in
a
scurry
of
smoke
and
snow
and
debris
and
then
a
black
pall
would
fall
on
it
when
only
the
thunder
of
the
guns
told
of
the
battle
peter
felt
very
sick
he
had
not
believed
there
could
be
so
much
noise
in
the
world
and
the
drums
of
his
ears
were
splitting
now
for
a
man
to
whom
courage
is
habitual
the
taste
of
fear
naked
utter
fear
is
a
horrible
thing
it
seems
to
wash
away
all
his
manhood
peter
lay
on
the
crest
watching
the
shells
burst
and
confident
that
any
moment
he
might
be
a
shattered
remnant
he
lay
and
reasoned
with
himself
calling
himself
every
name
he
could
think
of
but
conscious
that
nothing
would
get
rid
of
that
lump
of
ice
below
his
heart
then
he
could
stand
it
no
longer
he
got
up
and
ran
for
his
life
but
he
ran
forward
it
was
the
craziest
performance
he
went
over
a
piece
of
ground
which
was
being
watered
with
but
by
the
mercy
of
heaven
nothing
hit
him
he
took
some
fearsome
tosses
in
but
partly
erect
and
partly
on
all
fours
he
did
the
fifty
yards
and
tumbled
into
a
turkish
trench
right
on
top
of
a
dead
man
the
contact
with
that
body
brought
him
to
his
senses
that
men
could
die
at
all
seemed
a
comforting
homely
thing
after
that
unnatural
pandemonium
the
next
moment
a
crump
took
the
parapet
of
the
trench
some
yards
to
his
left
and
he
was
half
buried
in
an
avalanche
he
crawled
out
of
that
pretty
badly
cut
about
the
head
he
was
quite
cool
now
and
thinking
hard
about
his
next
step
there
were
men
all
around
him
sullen
dark
faces
as
he
saw
them
when
the
flares
went
up
they
were
manning
the
parapets
and
waiting
tensely
for
something
else
than
the
shelling
they
paid
no
attention
to
him
for
i
fancy
in
that
trench
units
were
pretty
well
mixed
up
and
under
a
bad
bombardment
no
one
bothers
about
his
neighbour
he
found
himself
free
to
move
as
he
pleased
the
ground
of
the
trench
was
littered
with
empty
and
there
were
many
dead
bodies
the
last
shell
as
i
have
said
had
played
havoc
with
the
parapet
in
the
next
spell
of
darkness
peter
crawled
through
the
gap
and
twisted
among
some
snowy
hillocks
he
was
no
longer
afraid
of
shells
any
more
than
he
was
afraid
of
a
veld
thunderstorm
but
he
was
wondering
very
hard
how
he
should
ever
get
to
the
russians
the
turks
were
behind
him
now
but
there
was
the
biggest
danger
in
front
then
the
artillery
ceased
it
was
so
sudden
that
he
thought
he
had
gone
deaf
and
could
hardly
realize
the
blessed
relief
of
it
the
wind
too
seemed
to
have
fallen
or
perhaps
he
was
sheltered
by
the
lee
of
the
hill
there
were
a
lot
of
dead
here
also
and
that
he
could
understand
for
they
were
new
dead
had
the
turks
attacked
and
been
driven
back
when
he
had
gone
about
thirty
yards
he
stopped
to
take
his
bearings
on
the
right
were
the
ruins
of
a
large
building
set
on
fire
by
the
guns
there
was
a
blur
of
woods
and
the
debris
of
walls
round
it
away
to
the
left
another
hill
ran
out
farther
to
the
east
and
the
place
he
was
in
seemed
to
be
a
kind
of
cup
between
the
spurs
just
before
him
was
a
little
ruined
building
with
the
sky
seen
through
its
rafters
for
the
smouldering
ruin
on
the
right
gave
a
certain
light
he
wondered
if
the
russian
lay
there
just
then
he
heard
voices
smothered
voices
not
a
yard
away
and
apparently
below
the
ground
he
instantly
jumped
to
what
this
must
mean
it
was
a
turkish
trench
a
communication
trench
peter
know
much
about
modern
warfare
but
he
had
read
in
the
papers
or
heard
from
me
enough
to
make
him
draw
the
right
moral
the
fresh
dead
pointed
to
the
same
conclusion
what
he
had
got
through
were
the
turkish
support
trenches
not
their
that
was
still
before
him
he
did
despair
for
the
rebound
from
panic
had
made
him
extra
courageous
he
crawled
forward
an
inch
at
a
time
taking
no
sort
of
risk
and
presently
found
himself
looking
at
the
parados
of
a
trench
then
he
lay
quiet
to
think
out
the
next
step
the
shelling
had
stopped
and
there
was
that
queer
kind
of
peace
which
falls
sometimes
on
two
armies
not
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
peter
said
he
could
hear
nothing
but
the
sighing
of
the
wind
there
seemed
to
be
no
movement
of
any
kind
in
the
trench
before
him
which
ran
through
the
ruined
building
the
light
of
the
burning
was
dying
and
he
could
just
make
out
the
mound
of
earth
a
yard
in
front
he
began
to
feel
hungry
and
got
out
his
packet
of
food
and
had
a
swig
at
the
brandy
flask
that
comforted
him
and
he
felt
a
master
of
his
fate
again
but
the
next
step
was
not
so
easy
he
must
find
out
what
lay
behind
that
mound
of
earth
suddenly
a
curious
sound
fell
on
his
ears
it
was
so
faint
that
at
first
he
doubted
the
evidence
of
his
senses
then
as
the
wind
fell
it
came
louder
it
was
exactly
like
some
hollow
piece
of
metal
being
struck
by
a
stick
musical
and
oddly
resonant
he
concluded
it
was
the
wind
blowing
a
branch
of
a
tree
against
an
old
boiler
in
the
ruin
before
him
the
trouble
was
that
there
was
scarcely
enough
wind
now
for
that
in
this
sheltered
cup
but
as
he
listened
he
caught
the
note
again
it
was
a
bell
a
fallen
bell
and
the
place
before
him
must
have
been
a
chapel
he
remembered
that
an
armenian
monastery
had
been
marked
on
the
big
map
and
he
guessed
it
was
the
burned
building
on
his
right
the
thought
of
a
chapel
and
a
bell
gave
him
the
notion
of
some
human
agency
and
then
suddenly
the
notion
was
confirmed
the
sound
was
regular
and
concerted
dot
dash
dot
dash
dot
dot
the
branch
of
a
tree
and
the
wind
may
play
strange
pranks
but
they
do
not
produce
the
longs
and
shorts
of
the
morse
code
this
was
where
peter
intelligence
work
in
the
boer
war
helped
him
he
knew
the
morse
he
could
read
it
but
he
could
make
nothing
of
the
signalling
it
was
either
in
some
special
code
or
in
a
strange
language
he
lay
still
and
did
some
calm
thinking
there
was
a
man
in
front
of
him
a
turkish
soldier
who
was
in
the
enemy
pay
therefore
he
could
fraternize
with
him
for
they
were
on
the
same
side
but
how
was
he
to
approach
him
without
getting
shot
in
the
process
again
how
could
a
man
send
signals
to
the
enemy
from
a
without
being
detected
peter
found
an
answer
in
the
strange
configuration
of
the
ground
he
had
not
heard
a
sound
until
he
was
a
few
yards
from
the
place
and
they
would
be
inaudible
to
men
in
the
reserve
trenches
and
even
in
the
communication
trenches
if
somebody
moving
up
the
latter
caught
the
noise
it
would
be
easy
to
explain
it
naturally
but
the
wind
blowing
down
the
cup
would
carry
it
far
in
the
enemy
direction
there
remained
the
risk
of
being
heard
by
those
parallel
with
the
bell
in
the
firing
trenches
peter
concluded
that
that
trench
must
be
very
thinly
held
probably
only
by
a
few
observers
and
the
nearest
might
be
a
dozen
yards
off
he
had
read
about
that
being
the
french
fashion
under
a
big
bombardment
the
next
thing
was
to
find
out
how
to
make
himself
known
to
this
ally
he
decided
that
the
only
way
was
to
surprise
him
he
might
get
shot
but
he
trusted
to
his
strength
and
agility
against
a
man
who
was
almost
certainly
wearied
when
he
had
got
him
safe
explanations
might
follow
peter
was
now
enjoying
himself
hugely
if
only
those
infernal
guns
kept
silent
he
would
play
out
the
game
in
the
sober
decorous
way
he
loved
so
very
delicately
he
began
to
wriggle
forward
to
where
the
sound
was
the
night
was
now
as
black
as
ink
around
him
and
very
quiet
too
except
for
soughings
of
the
dying
gale
the
snow
had
drifted
a
little
in
the
lee
of
the
ruined
walls
and
peter
progress
was
naturally
very
slow
he
could
not
afford
to
dislodge
one
ounce
of
snow
still
the
tinkling
went
on
now
in
greater
volume
peter
was
in
terror
lest
it
should
cease
before
he
got
his
man
presently
his
hand
clutched
at
empty
space
he
was
on
the
lip
of
the
front
trench
the
sound
was
now
a
yard
to
his
right
and
with
infinite
care
he
shifted
his
position
now
the
bell
was
just
below
him
and
he
felt
the
big
rafter
of
the
woodwork
from
which
it
had
fallen
he
felt
something
else
a
stretch
of
wire
fixed
in
the
ground
with
the
far
end
hanging
in
the
void
that
would
be
the
spy
explanation
if
anyone
heard
the
sound
and
came
seeking
the
cause
somewhere
in
the
darkness
before
him
and
below
was
the
man
not
a
yard
off
peter
remained
very
still
studying
the
situation
he
could
not
see
but
he
could
feel
the
presence
and
he
was
trying
to
decide
the
relative
position
of
the
man
and
bell
and
their
exact
distance
from
him
the
thing
was
not
so
easy
as
it
looked
for
if
he
jumped
for
where
he
believed
the
figure
was
he
might
miss
it
and
get
a
bullet
in
the
stomach
a
man
who
played
so
risky
a
game
was
probably
handy
with
his
firearms
besides
if
he
should
hit
the
bell
he
would
make
a
hideous
row
and
alarm
the
whole
front
fate
suddenly
gave
him
the
right
chance
the
unseen
figure
stood
up
and
moved
a
step
till
his
back
was
against
the
parados
he
actually
brushed
against
peter
elbow
who
held
his
breath
there
is
a
catch
that
the
kaffirs
have
which
would
need
several
diagrams
to
explain
it
is
partly
a
neck
hold
and
partly
a
paralysing
backward
twist
of
the
right
arm
but
if
it
is
practised
on
a
man
from
behind
it
locks
him
as
sure
as
if
he
were
handcuffed
peter
slowly
got
his
body
raised
and
his
knees
drawn
under
him
and
reached
for
his
prey
he
got
him
a
head
was
pulled
backward
over
the
edge
of
the
trench
and
he
felt
in
the
air
the
motion
of
the
left
arm
pawing
feebly
but
unable
to
reach
behind
still
whispered
peter
in
german
mean
you
no
harm
we
are
friends
of
the
same
purpose
do
you
speak
german
said
a
muffled
voice
said
the
voice
god
said
peter
we
can
understand
each
other
watched
your
notion
of
signalling
and
a
very
good
one
it
is
i
got
to
get
through
to
the
russian
lines
somehow
before
morning
and
i
want
you
to
help
me
i
english
a
kind
of
english
so
we
on
the
same
side
if
i
let
go
your
neck
will
you
be
good
and
talk
reasonably
the
voice
assented
peter
let
go
and
in
the
same
instant
slipped
to
the
side
the
man
wheeled
round
and
flung
out
an
arm
but
gripped
vacancy
friend
said
peter
must
play
tricks
with
me
or
be
angry
are
you
who
sent
you
asked
the
puzzled
voice
peter
had
a
happy
thought
companions
of
the
rosy
hours
he
said
are
we
friends
indeed
said
the
voice
out
of
the
darkness
friend
and
i
will
do
you
no
harm
i
am
a
good
turk
and
i
fought
beside
the
english
in
kordofan
and
learned
their
tongue
i
live
only
to
see
the
ruin
of
enver
who
has
beggared
my
family
and
slain
my
twin
brother
therefore
i
serve
the
do
know
what
the
musky
jaws
are
but
if
you
mean
the
russians
with
you
i
got
news
for
them
which
will
make
enver
green
the
question
is
how
i
to
get
to
them
and
that
is
where
you
shall
help
me
my
friend
playing
that
little
tune
of
yours
again
tell
them
to
expect
within
the
next
a
deserter
with
an
important
message
tell
them
for
god
sake
not
to
fire
at
anybody
till
they
made
certain
it
is
me
the
man
took
the
blunt
end
of
his
bayonet
and
squatted
beside
the
bell
the
first
stroke
brought
out
a
clear
searching
note
which
floated
down
the
valley
he
struck
three
notes
at
slow
intervals
for
all
the
world
peter
said
he
was
like
a
telegraph
operator
calling
up
a
station
the
message
in
english
said
peter
may
not
understand
it
said
the
man
send
it
any
way
you
like
i
trust
you
for
we
are
brothers
after
ten
minutes
the
man
ceased
and
listened
from
far
away
came
the
sound
of
a
the
kind
of
thing
they
used
on
the
western
front
to
give
the
say
they
will
be
ready
he
said
can
not
take
down
messages
in
the
darkness
but
they
have
given
me
the
signal
which
means
consent
that
is
pretty
good
said
peter
now
i
must
be
moving
you
take
a
hint
from
me
when
you
hear
big
firing
up
to
the
north
get
ready
to
beat
a
quick
retreat
for
it
will
be
all
up
with
that
city
of
yours
and
tell
your
folk
too
that
they
making
a
bad
mistake
letting
those
fool
germans
rule
their
land
let
them
hang
enver
and
his
little
friends
and
we
be
happy
once
more
satan
receive
his
soul
said
the
turk
is
wire
before
us
but
i
will
show
you
a
way
through
the
guns
this
evening
made
many
rents
in
it
but
haste
for
a
working
party
may
be
here
presently
to
repair
it
remember
there
is
much
wire
before
the
other
lines
peter
with
certain
directions
found
it
pretty
easy
to
make
his
way
through
the
entanglement
there
was
one
bit
which
scraped
a
hole
in
his
back
but
very
soon
he
had
come
to
the
last
posts
and
found
himself
in
open
country
the
place
he
said
was
a
graveyard
of
the
unburied
dead
that
smelt
horribly
as
he
crawled
among
them
he
had
no
inducements
to
delay
for
he
thought
he
could
hear
behind
him
the
movement
of
the
turkish
working
party
and
was
in
terror
that
a
flare
might
reveal
him
and
a
volley
accompany
his
retreat
from
one
to
another
he
wormed
his
way
till
he
struck
an
old
ruinous
communication
trench
which
led
in
the
right
direction
the
turks
must
have
been
forced
back
in
the
past
week
and
the
russians
were
now
in
the
evacuated
trenches
the
thing
was
half
full
of
water
but
it
gave
peter
a
feeling
of
safety
for
it
enabled
him
to
get
his
head
below
the
level
of
the
ground
then
it
came
to
an
end
and
he
found
before
him
a
forest
of
wire
the
turk
in
his
signal
had
mentioned
half
an
hour
but
peter
thought
it
was
nearer
two
hours
before
he
got
through
that
noxious
entanglement
shelling
had
made
little
difference
to
it
the
uprights
were
all
there
and
the
barbed
strands
seemed
to
touch
the
ground
remember
he
had
no
nothing
but
his
bare
hands
once
again
fear
got
hold
of
him
he
felt
caught
in
a
net
with
monstrous
vultures
waiting
to
pounce
on
him
from
above
at
any
moment
a
flare
might
go
up
and
a
dozen
rifles
find
their
mark
he
had
altogether
forgotten
about
the
message
which
had
been
sent
for
no
message
could
dissuade
the
death
he
felt
around
him
it
was
he
said
like
following
an
old
lion
into
bush
when
there
was
but
one
narrow
way
in
and
no
road
out
the
guns
began
again
the
turkish
guns
from
behind
the
ridge
and
a
shell
tore
up
the
wire
a
short
way
before
him
under
cover
of
the
burst
he
made
good
a
few
yards
leaving
large
portions
of
his
clothing
in
the
strands
then
quite
suddenly
when
hope
had
almost
died
in
his
heart
he
felt
the
ground
rise
steeply
he
lay
very
still
a
from
the
turkish
side
lit
up
the
place
and
there
in
front
was
a
rampart
with
the
points
of
bayonets
showing
beyond
it
it
was
the
russian
hour
for
he
raised
his
cramped
limbs
from
the
ground
and
shouted
english
a
face
looked
down
at
him
and
then
the
darkness
again
descended
he
said
hoarsely
he
heard
speech
behind
the
parapet
an
electric
torch
was
flashed
on
him
for
a
second
a
voice
spoke
a
friendly
voice
and
the
sound
of
it
seemed
to
be
telling
him
to
come
over
he
was
now
standing
up
and
as
he
got
his
hands
on
the
parapet
he
seemed
to
feel
bayonets
very
near
him
but
the
voice
that
spoke
was
kindly
so
with
a
heave
he
scrambled
over
and
flopped
into
the
trench
once
more
the
electric
torch
was
flashed
and
revealed
to
the
eyes
of
the
onlookers
an
indescribably
dirty
lean
man
with
a
bloody
head
and
scarcely
a
rag
of
shirt
on
his
back
the
said
man
seeing
friendly
faces
around
him
grinned
cheerfully
was
a
rough
trek
friends
he
said
want
to
see
your
general
pretty
quick
for
i
got
a
present
for
him
he
was
taken
to
an
officer
in
a
who
addressed
him
in
french
which
he
did
not
understand
but
the
sight
of
stumm
plan
worked
wonders
after
that
he
was
fairly
bundled
down
communication
trenches
and
then
over
swampy
fields
to
a
farm
among
trees
there
he
found
staff
officers
who
looked
at
him
and
looked
at
his
map
and
then
put
him
on
a
horse
and
hurried
him
eastwards
at
last
he
came
to
a
big
ruined
house
and
was
taken
into
a
room
which
seemed
to
be
full
of
maps
and
generals
the
conclusion
must
be
told
in
peter
words
was
a
big
man
sitting
at
a
table
drinking
coffee
and
when
i
saw
him
my
heart
jumped
out
of
my
skin
for
it
was
the
man
i
hunted
with
on
the
pungwe
in
him
whom
the
kaffirs
called
buck
horn
because
of
his
long
curled
moustaches
he
was
a
prince
even
then
and
now
he
is
a
very
great
general
when
i
saw
him
i
ran
forward
and
gripped
his
hand
and
cried
gat
het
and
he
knew
me
and
shouted
in
dutch
damn
if
it
is
old
peter
pienaar
then
he
gave
me
coffee
and
ham
and
good
bread
and
he
looked
at
my
map
what
is
this
he
cried
growing
red
in
the
face
it
is
the
of
one
stumm
a
german
who
commands
in
yon
city
i
said
looked
at
it
close
and
read
the
markings
and
then
he
read
the
other
paper
which
you
gave
me
dick
and
then
he
flung
up
his
arms
and
laughed
he
took
a
loaf
and
tossed
it
into
the
air
so
that
it
fell
on
the
head
of
another
general
he
spoke
to
them
in
their
own
tongue
and
they
too
laughed
and
one
or
two
ran
out
as
if
on
some
errand
i
have
never
seen
such
merrymaking
they
were
clever
men
and
knew
the
worth
of
what
you
gave
me
he
got
to
his
feet
and
hugged
me
all
dirty
as
i
was
and
kissed
me
on
both
cheeks
before
god
peter
he
said
you
the
mightiest
hunter
since
nimrod
you
often
found
me
game
but
never
game
so
big
as
this
chapter
the
little
hill
it
was
a
wise
man
who
said
that
the
biggest
kind
of
courage
was
to
be
able
to
sit
still
i
used
to
feel
that
when
we
were
getting
shelled
in
the
reserve
trenches
outside
vermelles
i
felt
it
before
we
went
over
the
parapets
at
loos
but
i
never
felt
it
so
much
as
on
the
last
two
days
in
that
cellar
i
had
simply
to
set
my
teeth
and
take
a
pull
on
myself
peter
had
gone
on
a
crazy
errand
which
i
scarcely
believed
could
come
off
there
were
no
signs
of
sandy
somewhere
within
a
hundred
yards
he
was
fighting
his
own
battles
and
i
was
tormented
by
the
thought
that
he
might
get
jumpy
again
and
wreck
everything
a
strange
companion
brought
us
food
a
man
who
spoke
only
turkish
and
could
tell
us
nothing
hussin
i
judged
was
busy
about
the
horses
if
i
could
only
have
done
something
to
help
on
matters
i
could
have
scotched
my
anxiety
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
nothing
but
wait
and
brood
i
tell
you
i
began
to
sympathize
with
the
general
behind
the
lines
in
a
battle
the
fellow
who
makes
the
plan
which
others
execute
leading
a
charge
can
be
nothing
like
so
a
business
as
sitting
in
an
and
waiting
on
the
news
of
it
it
was
bitter
cold
and
we
spent
most
of
the
day
wrapped
in
our
greatcoats
and
buried
deep
in
the
straw
blenkiron
was
a
marvel
there
was
no
light
for
him
to
play
patience
by
but
he
never
complained
he
slept
a
lot
of
the
time
and
when
he
was
awake
talked
as
cheerily
as
if
he
were
starting
out
on
a
holiday
he
had
one
great
comfort
his
dyspepsia
was
gone
he
sang
hymns
constantly
to
the
benign
providence
that
had
squared
his
duodenum
my
only
occupation
was
to
listen
for
the
guns
the
first
day
after
peter
left
they
were
very
quiet
on
the
front
nearest
us
but
in
the
late
evening
they
started
a
terrific
racket
the
next
day
they
never
stopped
from
dawn
to
dusk
so
that
it
reminded
me
of
that
tremendous
hours
before
loos
i
tried
to
read
into
this
some
proof
that
peter
had
got
through
but
it
would
not
work
it
looked
more
like
the
opposite
for
this
desperate
hammering
must
mean
that
the
frontal
assault
was
still
the
russian
game
two
or
three
times
i
climbed
on
the
housetop
for
fresh
air
the
day
was
foggy
and
damp
and
i
could
see
very
little
of
the
countryside
transport
was
still
bumping
southward
along
the
road
to
the
palantuken
and
the
slow
of
wounded
returning
one
thing
i
noticed
however
there
was
a
perpetual
coming
and
going
between
the
house
and
the
city
motors
and
mounted
messengers
were
constantly
arriving
and
departing
and
i
concluded
that
hilda
von
einem
was
getting
ready
for
her
part
in
the
defence
of
erzerum
these
ascents
were
all
on
the
first
day
after
peter
going
the
second
day
when
i
tried
the
trap
i
found
it
closed
and
heavily
weighted
this
must
have
been
done
by
our
friends
and
very
right
too
if
the
house
were
becoming
a
place
of
public
resort
it
would
never
do
for
me
to
be
journeying
late
on
the
second
night
hussin
reappeared
it
was
after
supper
when
blenkiron
had
gone
peacefully
to
sleep
and
i
was
beginning
to
count
the
hours
till
the
morning
i
could
not
close
an
eye
during
these
days
and
not
much
at
night
hussin
did
not
light
a
lantern
i
heard
his
key
in
the
lock
and
then
his
light
step
close
to
where
we
lay
you
asleep
he
said
and
when
i
answered
he
sat
down
beside
me
horses
are
found
he
said
the
master
bids
me
tell
you
that
we
start
in
the
morning
three
hours
before
dawn
it
was
welcome
news
me
what
is
happening
i
begged
have
been
lying
in
this
tomb
for
three
days
and
heard
nothing
guns
are
busy
he
said
allemans
come
to
this
place
every
hour
i
know
not
for
what
also
there
has
been
a
great
search
for
you
the
searchers
have
been
here
but
they
were
sent
away
empty
sleep
my
lord
for
there
is
wild
work
before
us
i
did
not
sleep
much
for
i
was
strung
too
high
with
expectation
and
i
envied
blenkiron
his
now
eupeptic
slumbers
but
for
an
hour
or
so
i
dropped
off
and
my
old
nightmare
came
back
once
again
i
was
in
the
throat
of
a
pass
hotly
pursued
straining
for
some
sanctuary
which
i
knew
i
must
reach
but
i
was
no
longer
alone
others
were
with
me
how
many
i
could
not
tell
for
when
i
tried
to
see
their
faces
they
dissolved
in
mist
deep
snow
was
underfoot
a
grey
sky
was
over
us
black
peaks
were
on
all
sides
but
ahead
in
the
mist
of
the
pass
was
that
curious
which
i
had
first
seen
in
my
dream
on
the
erzerum
road
i
saw
it
distinct
in
every
detail
it
rose
to
the
left
of
the
road
through
the
pass
above
a
hollow
where
great
boulders
stood
out
in
the
snow
its
sides
were
steep
so
that
the
snow
had
slipped
off
in
patches
leaving
stretches
of
glistening
black
shale
the
at
the
top
did
not
rise
sheer
but
sloped
at
an
angle
of
and
on
the
very
summit
there
seemed
a
hollow
as
if
the
earth
within
the
had
been
beaten
by
weather
into
a
cup
that
is
often
the
way
with
a
south
african
and
i
knew
it
was
so
with
this
we
were
straining
for
it
but
the
snow
clogged
us
and
our
enemies
were
very
close
behind
then
i
was
awakened
by
a
figure
at
my
side
ready
my
lord
it
said
is
the
hour
to
ride
like
we
moved
into
the
sharp
air
hussin
led
us
out
of
an
old
postern
and
then
through
a
place
like
an
orchard
to
the
shelter
of
some
tall
evergreen
trees
there
horses
stood
champing
quietly
from
their
nosebags
i
thought
feed
of
oats
before
a
big
effort
there
were
nine
beasts
for
nine
riders
we
mounted
without
a
word
and
filed
through
a
grove
of
trees
to
where
a
broken
paling
marked
the
beginning
of
cultivated
land
there
for
the
matter
of
twenty
minutes
hussin
chose
to
guide
us
through
deep
clogging
snow
he
wanted
to
avoid
any
sound
till
we
were
well
beyond
earshot
of
the
house
then
we
struck
a
which
presently
merged
in
a
hard
highway
running
as
i
judged
by
west
there
we
delayed
no
longer
but
galloped
furiously
into
the
dark
i
had
got
back
all
my
exhilaration
indeed
i
was
intoxicated
with
the
movement
and
could
have
laughed
out
loud
and
sung
under
the
black
canopy
of
the
night
perils
are
either
forgotten
or
terribly
alive
mine
were
forgotten
the
darkness
i
galloped
into
led
me
to
freedom
and
friends
yes
and
success
which
i
had
not
dared
to
hope
and
scarcely
even
to
dream
of
hussin
rode
first
with
me
at
his
side
i
turned
my
head
and
saw
blenkiron
behind
me
evidently
mortally
unhappy
about
the
pace
we
set
and
the
mount
he
sat
he
used
to
say
that
was
good
for
his
liver
but
it
was
a
gentle
amble
and
a
short
gallop
that
he
liked
and
not
this
mad
his
thighs
were
too
round
to
fit
a
saddle
leather
we
passed
a
fire
in
a
hollow
the
bivouac
of
some
turkish
unit
and
all
the
horses
shied
violently
i
knew
by
blenkiron
oaths
that
he
had
lost
his
stirrups
and
was
sitting
on
his
horse
neck
beside
him
rode
a
tall
figure
swathed
to
the
eyes
in
wrappings
and
wearing
round
his
neck
some
kind
of
shawl
whose
ends
floated
behind
him
sandy
of
course
had
no
european
ulster
for
it
was
months
since
he
had
worn
proper
clothes
i
wanted
to
speak
to
him
but
somehow
i
did
not
dare
his
stillness
forbade
me
he
was
a
wonderful
fine
horseman
with
his
firm
english
hunting
seat
and
it
was
as
well
for
he
paid
no
attention
to
his
beast
his
head
was
still
full
of
unquiet
thoughts
then
the
air
around
me
began
to
smell
acrid
and
raw
and
i
saw
that
a
fog
was
winding
up
from
the
hollows
the
devil
own
luck
i
cried
to
hussin
you
guide
us
in
a
mist
do
not
know
he
shook
his
head
had
counted
on
seeing
the
shape
of
the
hills
a
map
and
compass
anyhow
but
these
make
slow
travelling
pray
god
it
lifts
presently
the
black
vapour
changed
to
grey
and
the
day
broke
it
was
little
comfort
the
fog
rolled
in
waves
to
the
horses
ears
and
riding
at
the
head
of
the
party
i
could
but
dimly
see
the
next
rank
is
time
to
leave
the
road
said
hussin
we
may
meet
inquisitive
folk
we
struck
to
the
left
over
ground
which
was
for
all
the
world
like
a
scotch
moor
there
were
pools
of
rain
on
it
and
masses
of
tangled
junipers
and
long
reefs
of
wet
slaty
stone
it
was
bad
going
and
the
fog
made
it
hopeless
to
steer
a
good
course
i
had
out
the
map
and
the
compass
and
tried
to
fix
our
route
so
as
to
round
the
flank
of
a
spur
of
the
mountains
which
separated
us
from
the
valley
we
were
aiming
at
a
stream
ahead
of
us
i
said
to
hussin
it
fordable
is
only
a
trickle
he
said
coughing
accursed
mist
is
from
eblis
but
i
knew
long
before
we
reached
it
that
it
was
no
trickle
it
was
a
hill
stream
coming
down
in
spate
and
as
i
soon
guessed
in
a
deep
ravine
presently
we
were
at
its
edge
one
long
whirl
of
yeasty
falls
and
brown
rapids
we
could
as
soon
get
horses
over
it
as
to
the
topmost
cliffs
of
the
palantuken
hussin
stared
at
it
in
consternation
allah
forgive
my
folly
for
i
should
have
known
we
must
return
to
the
highway
and
find
a
bridge
my
sorrow
that
i
should
have
led
my
lords
so
back
over
that
moor
we
went
with
my
spirits
badly
damped
we
had
none
too
long
a
start
and
hilda
von
einem
would
rouse
heaven
and
earth
to
catch
us
up
hussin
was
forcing
the
pace
for
his
anxiety
was
as
great
as
mine
before
we
reached
the
road
the
mist
blew
back
and
revealed
a
wedge
of
country
right
across
to
the
hills
beyond
the
river
it
was
a
clear
view
every
object
standing
out
wet
and
sharp
in
the
light
of
morning
it
showed
the
bridge
with
horsemen
drawn
up
across
it
and
it
showed
too
cavalry
pickets
moving
along
the
road
they
saw
us
at
the
same
instant
a
word
was
passed
down
the
road
a
shrill
whistle
blew
and
the
pickets
put
their
horses
at
the
bank
and
started
across
the
moor
i
not
say
this
mist
was
from
eblis
growled
hussin
as
we
swung
round
and
galloped
back
on
our
tracks
cursed
zaptiehs
have
seen
us
and
our
road
is
cut
i
was
for
trying
the
stream
at
all
costs
but
hussin
pointed
out
that
it
would
do
us
no
good
the
cavalry
beyond
the
bridge
was
moving
up
the
other
bank
is
a
path
through
the
hills
that
i
know
but
it
must
be
travelled
on
foot
if
we
can
increase
our
lead
and
the
mist
cloaks
us
there
is
yet
a
chance
it
was
a
weary
business
plodding
up
to
the
skirts
of
the
hills
we
had
the
pursuit
behind
us
now
and
that
put
an
edge
on
every
difficulty
there
were
long
banks
of
broken
screes
i
remember
where
the
snow
slipped
in
wreaths
from
under
our
feet
great
boulders
had
to
be
circumvented
and
patches
of
bog
where
the
streams
from
the
snows
first
made
contact
with
the
plains
mired
us
to
our
girths
happily
the
mist
was
down
again
but
this
though
it
hindered
the
chase
lessened
the
chances
of
hussin
finding
the
path
he
found
it
nevertheless
there
was
the
gully
and
the
rough
leading
upwards
but
there
also
had
been
a
landslip
quite
recent
from
the
marks
a
large
scar
of
raw
earth
had
broken
across
the
hillside
which
with
the
snow
above
it
looked
like
a
slice
cut
out
of
an
iced
we
stared
blankly
for
a
second
till
we
recognized
its
hopelessness
trying
for
the
crags
i
said
there
once
was
a
way
another
can
be
found
be
picked
off
at
their
leisure
by
these
marksmen
said
hussin
grimly
the
mist
had
opened
again
and
a
glance
behind
showed
me
the
pursuit
closing
up
on
us
they
were
now
less
than
three
hundred
yards
off
we
turned
our
horses
and
made
off
along
the
skirts
of
the
cliffs
then
sandy
spoke
for
the
first
time
do
know
how
you
fellows
feel
but
i
not
going
to
be
taken
there
nothing
much
to
do
except
to
find
a
place
and
put
up
a
fight
we
can
sell
our
lives
dearly
about
all
said
blenkiron
cheerfully
he
had
suffered
such
tortures
on
that
gallop
that
he
welcomed
any
kind
of
stationary
fight
out
the
arms
said
sandy
the
companions
all
carried
rifles
slung
across
their
shoulders
hussin
from
a
deep
brought
out
rifles
and
bandoliers
for
the
rest
of
us
as
i
laid
mine
across
my
i
saw
it
was
a
german
mauser
of
the
latest
pattern
till
we
find
a
place
for
a
stand
said
sandy
game
against
us
this
time
once
more
we
entered
the
mist
and
presently
found
better
going
on
a
long
stretch
of
even
slope
then
came
a
rise
and
on
the
crest
of
it
i
saw
the
sun
presently
we
dipped
into
bright
daylight
and
looked
down
on
a
broad
glen
with
a
road
winding
up
it
to
a
pass
in
the
range
i
had
expected
this
it
was
one
way
to
the
palantuken
pass
some
miles
south
of
the
house
where
we
had
been
lodged
and
then
as
i
looked
southward
i
saw
what
i
had
been
watching
for
for
days
a
little
hill
split
the
valley
and
on
its
top
was
a
of
rocks
it
was
the
of
my
persistent
dream
on
that
i
promptly
took
charge
our
fort
i
cried
we
once
get
there
we
can
hold
it
for
a
week
sit
down
and
ride
for
it
we
bucketed
down
that
hillside
like
men
possessed
even
blenkiron
sticking
on
manfully
among
the
twists
and
turns
and
slithers
presently
we
were
on
the
road
and
were
racing
past
marching
infantry
and
gun
teams
and
empty
wagons
i
noted
that
most
seemed
to
be
moving
downward
and
few
going
up
hussin
screamed
some
words
in
turkish
that
secured
us
a
passage
but
indeed
our
crazy
speed
left
them
staring
out
of
a
corner
of
my
eye
i
saw
that
sandy
had
flung
off
most
of
his
wrappings
and
seemed
to
be
all
a
dazzle
of
rich
colour
but
i
had
thought
for
nothing
except
the
little
hill
now
almost
fronting
us
across
the
shallow
glen
no
horses
could
breast
that
steep
we
urged
them
into
the
hollow
and
then
hastily
dismounted
humped
the
packs
and
began
to
struggle
up
the
side
of
the
it
was
strewn
with
great
boulders
which
gave
a
kind
of
cover
that
very
soon
was
needed
for
snatching
a
glance
back
i
saw
that
our
pursuers
were
on
the
road
above
us
and
were
getting
ready
to
shoot
at
normal
times
we
would
have
been
easy
marks
but
fortunately
wisps
and
streamers
of
mist
now
clung
about
that
hollow
the
rest
could
fend
for
themselves
so
i
stuck
to
blenkiron
and
dragged
him
wholly
breathless
by
the
least
exposed
route
bullets
spattered
now
and
then
against
the
rocks
and
one
sang
unpleasantly
near
my
head
in
this
way
we
covered
of
the
distance
and
had
only
the
bare
dozen
yards
where
the
gradient
eased
off
up
to
the
edge
of
the
blenkiron
got
hit
in
the
leg
our
only
casualty
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
carry
him
so
i
swung
him
on
my
shoulders
and
with
a
bursting
heart
did
that
last
lap
it
was
hottish
work
and
the
bullets
were
pretty
thick
about
us
but
we
all
got
safely
to
the
and
a
short
scramble
took
us
over
the
edge
i
laid
blenkiron
inside
the
and
started
to
prepare
our
defence
we
had
little
time
to
do
it
out
of
the
thin
fog
figures
were
coming
crouching
in
cover
the
place
we
were
in
was
a
natural
redoubt
except
that
there
were
no
loopholes
or
sandbags
we
had
to
show
our
heads
over
the
rim
to
shoot
but
the
danger
was
lessened
by
the
superb
field
of
fire
given
by
those
last
dozen
yards
of
glacis
i
posted
the
men
and
waited
and
blenkiron
with
a
white
face
insisted
on
taking
his
share
announcing
that
he
used
to
be
handy
with
a
gun
i
gave
the
order
that
no
man
was
to
shoot
till
the
enemy
had
come
out
of
the
rocks
on
to
the
glacis
the
thing
ran
right
round
the
top
and
we
had
to
watch
all
sides
to
prevent
them
getting
us
in
flank
or
rear
hussin
rifle
cracked
out
presently
from
the
back
so
my
precautions
had
not
been
needless
we
were
all
three
fair
shots
though
none
of
us
up
to
miraculous
standard
and
the
companions
too
made
good
practice
the
mauser
was
the
weapon
i
knew
best
and
i
did
miss
much
the
attackers
never
had
a
chance
for
their
only
hope
was
to
rush
us
by
numbers
and
the
whole
party
being
not
above
two
dozen
they
were
far
too
few
i
think
we
killed
three
for
their
bodies
were
left
lying
and
wounded
at
least
six
while
the
rest
fell
back
towards
the
road
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
it
was
all
over
are
dogs
of
kurds
i
heard
hussin
say
fiercely
a
kurdish
would
fire
on
the
livery
of
the
kaaba
then
i
had
a
good
look
at
sandy
he
had
discarded
shawls
and
wrappings
and
stood
up
in
the
strangest
costume
man
ever
wore
in
battle
somehow
he
had
procured
and
an
old
pair
of
above
these
reaching
well
below
his
middle
he
had
a
wonderful
silken
jibbah
or
ephod
of
a
bright
emerald
i
call
it
silk
but
it
was
like
no
silk
i
have
ever
known
so
exquisite
in
the
mesh
with
such
a
sheen
and
depth
in
it
some
strange
pattern
was
woven
on
the
breast
which
in
the
dim
light
i
could
not
trace
i
warrant
no
rarer
or
costlier
garment
was
ever
exposed
to
lead
on
a
bleak
winter
hill
sandy
seemed
unconscious
of
his
garb
his
eye
listless
no
more
scanned
the
hollow
only
the
overture
he
cried
opera
will
soon
begin
we
must
put
a
breastwork
up
in
these
gaps
or
pick
us
off
from
a
thousand
yards
i
had
meantime
roughly
dressed
blenkiron
wound
with
a
linen
rag
which
hussin
provided
it
was
from
a
ricochet
bullet
which
had
chipped
into
his
left
shin
then
i
took
a
hand
with
the
others
in
getting
up
earthworks
to
complete
the
circuit
of
the
defence
it
was
no
easy
job
for
we
wrought
only
with
our
knives
and
had
to
dig
deep
down
below
the
snowy
gravel
as
we
worked
i
took
stock
of
our
refuge
the
was
a
rough
circle
about
ten
yards
in
diameter
its
interior
filled
with
boulders
and
loose
stones
and
its
parapet
about
four
feet
high
the
mist
had
cleared
for
a
considerable
space
and
i
could
see
the
immediate
surroundings
west
beyond
the
hollow
was
the
road
we
had
come
where
now
the
remnants
of
the
pursuit
were
clustered
north
the
hill
fell
steeply
to
the
valley
bottom
but
to
the
south
after
a
dip
there
was
a
ridge
which
shut
the
view
east
lay
another
fork
of
the
stream
the
chief
fork
i
guessed
and
it
was
evidently
followed
by
the
main
road
to
the
pass
for
i
saw
it
crowded
with
transport
the
two
roads
seemed
to
converge
somewhere
farther
south
of
my
sight
i
guessed
we
could
not
be
very
far
from
the
front
for
the
noise
of
guns
sounded
very
near
both
the
sharp
crack
of
the
and
the
deeper
boom
of
the
howitzers
more
i
could
hear
the
chatter
of
the
a
magpie
note
among
the
baying
of
hounds
i
even
saw
the
bursting
of
russian
shells
evidently
trying
to
reach
the
main
road
one
big
fellow
an
landed
not
ten
yards
from
a
convoy
to
the
east
of
us
and
another
in
the
hollow
through
which
we
had
come
these
were
clearly
ranging
shots
and
i
wondered
if
the
russians
had
on
the
heights
to
mark
them
if
so
they
might
soon
try
a
curtain
and
we
should
be
very
near
its
edge
it
would
be
an
odd
irony
if
we
were
the
target
of
friendly
shells
the
lord
harry
i
heard
sandy
say
we
had
a
brace
of
we
could
hold
this
place
against
a
division
price
shells
i
asked
they
get
a
gun
up
they
can
blow
us
to
atoms
in
ten
minutes
god
the
russians
keep
them
too
busy
for
that
was
his
answer
with
anxious
eyes
i
watched
our
enemies
on
the
road
they
seemed
to
have
grown
in
numbers
they
were
signalling
too
for
a
white
flag
fluttered
then
the
mist
rolled
down
on
us
again
and
our
prospect
was
limited
to
ten
yards
of
vapour
i
cried
may
try
to
rush
us
at
any
moment
every
man
keep
his
eye
on
the
edge
of
the
fog
and
shoot
at
the
first
sign
for
nearly
half
an
hour
by
my
watch
we
waited
in
that
queer
white
world
our
eyes
smarting
with
the
strain
of
peering
the
sound
of
the
guns
seemed
to
be
hushed
and
everything
grown
deathly
quiet
blenkiron
squeal
as
he
knocked
his
wounded
leg
against
a
rock
made
every
man
start
then
out
of
the
mist
there
came
a
voice
it
was
a
woman
voice
high
penetrating
and
sweet
but
it
spoke
in
no
tongue
i
knew
only
sandy
understood
he
made
a
sudden
movement
as
if
to
defend
himself
against
a
blow
the
speaker
came
into
clear
sight
on
the
glacis
a
yard
or
two
away
mine
was
the
first
face
she
saw
come
to
offer
terms
she
said
in
english
you
permit
me
to
enter
i
could
do
nothing
except
take
off
my
cap
and
say
blenkiron
snuggled
up
against
the
parapet
was
cursing
furiously
below
his
breath
she
climbed
up
the
and
stepped
over
the
edge
as
lightly
as
a
deer
her
clothes
were
strange
spurred
boots
and
breeches
over
which
fell
a
short
green
kirtle
a
little
cap
skewered
with
a
jewelled
pin
was
on
her
head
and
a
cape
of
some
coarse
country
cloth
hung
from
her
shoulders
she
had
rough
gauntlets
on
her
hands
and
she
carried
for
weapon
a
the
clung
to
her
hair
i
remember
and
a
silvery
film
of
fog
lay
on
her
garments
i
had
never
before
thought
of
her
as
beautiful
strange
uncanny
wonderful
if
you
like
but
the
word
beauty
had
too
kindly
and
human
a
sound
for
such
a
face
but
as
she
stood
with
heightened
colour
her
eyes
like
stars
her
poise
like
a
wild
bird
i
had
to
confess
that
she
had
her
own
loveliness
she
might
be
a
devil
but
she
was
also
a
queen
i
considered
that
there
might
be
merits
in
the
prospect
of
riding
by
her
side
into
jerusalem
sandy
stood
rigid
his
face
very
grave
and
set
she
held
out
both
hands
to
him
speaking
softly
in
turkish
i
noticed
that
the
six
companions
had
disappeared
from
the
and
were
somewhere
out
of
sight
on
the
farther
side
i
do
not
know
what
she
said
but
from
her
tone
and
above
all
from
her
eyes
i
judged
that
she
was
pleading
pleading
for
his
return
for
his
partnership
in
her
great
adventure
pleading
for
all
i
knew
for
his
love
his
expression
was
like
a
his
brows
drawn
tight
in
a
little
frown
and
his
jaw
rigid
he
said
ask
you
to
tell
your
business
quick
and
to
tell
it
in
english
my
friends
must
hear
it
as
well
as
me
friends
she
cried
has
a
prince
to
do
with
these
hirelings
your
slaves
perhaps
but
not
your
friends
friends
sandy
repeated
grimly
must
know
madam
that
i
am
a
british
officer
that
was
beyond
doubt
a
clean
staggering
stroke
what
she
had
thought
of
his
origin
god
knows
but
she
had
never
dreamed
of
this
her
eyes
grew
larger
and
more
lustrous
her
lips
parted
as
if
to
speak
but
her
voice
failed
her
then
by
an
effort
she
recovered
herself
and
out
of
that
strange
face
went
all
the
glow
of
youth
and
ardour
it
was
again
the
unholy
mask
i
had
first
known
these
others
she
asked
in
a
level
voice
is
a
brother
officer
of
my
regiment
the
other
is
an
american
friend
but
all
three
of
us
are
on
the
same
errand
we
came
east
to
destroy
greenmantle
and
your
devilish
ambitions
you
have
yourself
destroyed
your
prophets
and
now
it
is
your
turn
to
fail
and
disappear
make
no
mistake
madam
that
folly
is
over
i
will
tear
this
sacred
garment
into
a
thousand
pieces
and
scatter
them
on
the
wind
the
people
wait
today
for
the
revelation
but
none
will
come
you
may
kill
us
if
you
can
but
we
have
at
least
crushed
a
lie
and
done
service
to
our
country
i
would
not
have
taken
my
eyes
from
her
face
for
a
king
ransom
i
have
written
that
she
was
a
queen
and
of
that
there
is
no
manner
of
doubt
she
had
the
soul
of
a
conqueror
for
not
a
flicker
of
weakness
or
disappointment
marred
her
air
only
pride
and
the
stateliest
resolution
looked
out
of
her
eyes
said
i
came
to
offer
terms
i
will
still
offer
them
though
they
are
other
than
i
thought
for
the
fat
american
i
will
send
him
home
safely
to
his
own
country
i
do
not
make
war
on
such
as
he
he
is
germany
foe
not
mine
you
she
said
turning
fiercely
on
me
will
hang
before
dusk
never
in
my
life
had
i
been
so
pleased
i
had
got
my
revenge
at
last
this
woman
had
singled
me
out
above
the
others
as
the
object
of
her
wrath
and
i
almost
loved
her
for
it
she
turned
to
sandy
and
the
fierceness
went
out
of
her
face
seek
the
truth
she
said
also
do
i
and
if
we
use
a
lie
it
is
only
to
break
down
a
greater
you
are
of
my
household
in
spirit
and
you
alone
of
all
men
i
have
seen
are
fit
to
ride
with
me
on
my
mission
germany
may
fail
but
i
shall
not
fail
i
offer
you
the
greatest
career
that
mortal
has
known
i
offer
you
a
task
which
will
need
every
atom
of
brain
and
sinew
and
courage
will
you
refuse
that
destiny
i
do
not
know
what
effect
this
vapouring
might
have
had
in
hot
scented
rooms
or
in
the
languor
of
some
rich
garden
but
up
on
that
cold
it
was
as
unsubstantial
as
the
mist
around
us
it
sounded
not
even
impressive
only
crazy
stay
with
my
friends
said
sandy
i
will
offer
more
i
will
save
your
friends
they
too
shall
share
in
my
triumph
this
was
too
much
for
blenkiron
he
scrambled
to
his
feet
to
speak
the
protest
that
had
been
wrung
from
his
soul
forgot
his
game
leg
and
rolled
back
on
the
ground
with
a
groan
then
she
seemed
to
make
a
last
appeal
she
spoke
in
turkish
now
and
i
do
not
know
what
she
said
but
i
judged
it
was
the
plea
of
a
woman
to
her
lover
once
more
she
was
the
proud
beauty
but
there
was
a
tremor
in
her
pride
i
had
almost
written
tenderness
to
listen
to
her
was
like
horrid
treachery
like
eavesdropping
on
something
pitiful
i
know
my
cheeks
grew
scarlet
and
blenkiron
turned
away
his
head
sandy
face
did
not
move
he
spoke
in
english
can
offer
me
nothing
that
i
desire
he
said
am
the
servant
of
my
country
and
her
enemies
are
mine
i
can
have
neither
part
nor
lot
with
you
that
is
my
answer
madam
von
einem
then
her
steely
restraint
broke
it
was
like
a
dam
giving
before
a
mass
of
icy
water
she
tore
off
one
of
her
gauntlets
and
hurled
it
in
his
face
implacable
hate
looked
out
of
her
eyes
have
done
with
you
she
cried
have
scorned
me
but
you
have
dug
your
own
grave
she
leaped
on
the
parapet
and
the
next
second
was
on
the
glacis
once
more
the
mist
had
fled
and
across
the
hollow
i
saw
a
in
place
and
men
around
it
who
were
not
turkish
she
waved
her
hand
to
them
and
hastened
down
the
hillside
but
at
that
moment
i
heard
the
whistle
of
a
russian
shell
among
the
boulders
there
was
the
dull
shock
of
an
explosion
and
a
mushroom
of
red
earth
it
all
passed
in
an
instant
of
time
i
saw
the
gunners
on
the
road
point
their
hands
and
i
heard
them
cry
i
heard
too
a
kind
of
sob
from
blenkiron
all
this
before
i
realized
myself
what
had
happened
the
next
thing
i
saw
was
sandy
already
beyond
the
glacis
leaping
with
great
bounds
down
the
hill
they
were
shooting
at
him
but
he
heeded
them
not
for
the
space
of
a
minute
he
was
out
of
sight
and
his
whereabouts
was
shown
only
by
the
patter
of
bullets
then
he
came
back
walking
quite
slowly
up
the
last
slope
and
he
was
carrying
something
in
his
arms
the
enemy
fired
no
more
they
realized
what
had
happened
he
laid
his
burden
down
gently
in
a
corner
of
the
the
cap
had
fallen
off
and
the
hair
was
breaking
loose
the
face
was
very
white
but
there
was
no
wound
or
bruise
on
it
was
killed
at
once
i
heard
him
saying
back
was
broken
by
a
dick
we
must
bury
her
here
you
see
she
she
liked
me
i
can
make
her
no
return
but
this
we
set
the
companions
to
guard
and
with
infinite
slowness
using
our
hands
and
our
knives
we
made
a
shallow
grave
below
the
eastern
parapet
when
it
was
done
we
covered
her
face
with
the
linen
cloak
which
sandy
had
worn
that
morning
he
lifted
the
body
and
laid
it
reverently
in
its
place
did
not
know
that
anything
could
be
so
light
he
said
it
was
for
me
to
look
on
at
that
kind
of
scene
i
went
to
the
parapet
with
blenkiron
and
had
a
stare
at
our
friends
on
the
road
there
was
no
turk
there
and
i
guessed
why
for
it
would
not
be
easy
to
use
the
men
of
islam
against
the
wearer
of
the
green
ephod
the
enemy
were
german
or
austrian
and
they
had
a
they
seemed
to
have
got
it
laid
on
our
fort
but
they
were
waiting
as
i
looked
i
saw
behind
them
a
massive
figure
i
seemed
to
recognize
stumm
had
come
to
see
the
destruction
of
his
enemies
to
the
east
i
saw
another
gun
in
the
fields
just
below
the
main
road
they
had
got
us
on
both
sides
and
there
was
no
way
of
escape
hilda
von
einem
was
to
have
a
noble
pyre
and
goodly
company
for
the
dark
journey
dusk
was
falling
now
a
clear
bright
dusk
where
the
stars
pricked
through
a
sheen
of
amethyst
the
artillery
were
busy
all
around
the
horizon
and
towards
the
pass
on
the
other
road
where
fort
palantuken
stood
there
was
the
dust
and
smoke
of
a
furious
bombardment
it
seemed
to
me
too
that
the
guns
on
the
other
fronts
had
come
nearer
deve
boyun
was
hidden
by
a
spur
of
hill
but
up
in
the
north
white
clouds
like
the
streamers
of
evening
were
hanging
over
the
euphrates
glen
the
whole
firmament
hummed
and
twanged
like
a
taut
string
that
has
been
struck
as
i
looked
the
gun
to
the
west
fired
the
gun
where
stumm
was
the
shell
dropped
ten
yards
to
our
right
a
second
later
another
fell
behind
us
blenkiron
had
dragged
himself
to
the
parapet
i
do
suppose
he
had
ever
been
shelled
before
but
his
face
showed
curiosity
rather
than
fear
poor
shooting
i
reckon
he
said
the
contrary
i
said
know
their
business
bracketing
the
words
were
not
out
of
my
mouth
when
one
fell
right
among
us
it
struck
the
far
rim
of
the
shattering
the
rock
but
bursting
mainly
outside
we
all
ducked
and
barring
some
small
scratches
no
one
was
a
penny
the
worse
i
remember
that
much
of
the
debris
fell
on
hilda
von
einem
grave
i
pulled
blenkiron
over
the
far
parapet
and
called
on
the
rest
to
follow
meaning
to
take
cover
on
the
rough
side
of
the
hill
but
as
we
showed
ourselves
shots
rang
out
from
our
front
shots
fired
from
a
range
of
a
few
hundred
yards
it
was
easy
to
see
what
had
happened
riflemen
had
been
sent
to
hold
us
in
rear
they
would
not
assault
so
long
as
we
remained
in
the
but
they
would
block
any
attempt
to
find
safety
outside
it
stumm
and
his
gun
had
us
at
their
mercy
we
crouched
below
the
parapet
again
may
as
well
toss
for
it
i
said
only
two
ways
to
stay
here
and
be
shelled
or
try
to
break
through
those
fellows
behind
either
pretty
unhealthy
but
i
knew
there
was
no
choice
with
blenkiron
crippled
we
were
pinned
to
the
our
numbers
were
up
all
right
chapter
the
guns
of
the
north
but
no
more
shells
fell
the
night
grew
dark
and
showed
a
field
of
glittering
stars
for
the
air
was
sharpening
again
towards
frost
we
waited
for
an
hour
crouching
just
behind
the
far
parapets
but
never
came
that
ominous
familiar
whistle
then
sandy
rose
and
stretched
himself
hungry
he
said
have
out
the
food
hussin
we
eaten
nothing
since
before
daybreak
i
wonder
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
respite
i
fancied
i
knew
stumm
way
i
said
wants
to
torture
us
he
keep
us
hours
on
tenterhooks
while
he
sits
over
yonder
exulting
in
what
he
thinks
we
enduring
he
has
just
enough
imagination
for
that
he
would
rush
us
if
he
had
the
men
as
it
is
he
going
to
blow
us
to
pieces
but
do
it
slowly
and
smack
his
lips
over
it
sandy
yawned
disappoint
him
for
we
wo
be
worried
old
man
we
three
are
beyond
that
kind
of
fear
we
going
to
do
the
best
we
can
i
said
got
the
exact
range
for
his
we
got
to
find
a
hole
somewhere
just
outside
the
and
some
sort
of
we
bound
to
get
damaged
whatever
happens
but
we
stick
it
out
to
the
end
when
they
think
they
have
finished
with
us
and
rush
the
place
there
may
be
one
of
us
alive
to
put
a
bullet
through
old
stumm
what
do
you
say
they
agreed
and
after
our
meal
sandy
and
i
crawled
out
to
prospect
leaving
the
others
on
guard
in
case
there
should
be
an
attack
we
found
a
hollow
in
the
glacis
a
little
south
of
the
and
working
very
quietly
managed
to
enlarge
it
and
cut
a
kind
of
shallow
cave
in
the
hill
it
would
be
no
use
against
a
direct
hit
but
it
would
give
some
cover
from
flying
fragments
as
i
read
the
situation
stumm
could
land
as
many
shells
as
he
pleased
in
the
and
would
bother
to
attend
to
the
flanks
when
the
bad
shelling
began
there
would
be
shelter
for
one
or
two
in
the
cave
our
enemies
were
watchful
the
riflemen
on
the
east
burnt
very
flares
at
intervals
and
stumm
lot
sent
up
a
great
i
remember
that
just
before
midnight
hell
broke
loose
round
fort
palantuken
no
more
russian
shells
came
into
our
hollow
but
all
the
road
to
the
east
was
under
fire
and
at
the
fort
itself
there
was
a
shattering
explosion
and
a
queer
scarlet
glow
which
looked
as
if
a
magazine
had
been
hit
for
about
two
hours
the
firing
was
intense
and
then
it
died
down
but
it
was
towards
the
north
that
i
kept
turning
my
head
there
seemed
to
be
something
different
in
the
sound
there
something
sharper
in
the
report
of
the
guns
as
if
shells
were
dropping
in
a
narrow
valley
whose
rock
walls
doubled
the
echo
had
the
russians
by
any
blessed
chance
worked
round
that
flank
i
got
sandy
to
listen
but
he
shook
his
head
guns
are
a
dozen
miles
off
he
said
no
nearer
than
three
days
ago
but
it
looks
as
if
the
sportsmen
on
the
south
might
have
a
chance
when
they
break
through
and
stream
down
the
valley
they
be
puzzled
to
account
for
what
remains
of
us
we
no
longer
three
adventurers
in
the
enemy
country
we
the
advance
guard
of
the
allies
our
pals
do
know
about
us
and
we
going
to
be
cut
off
which
has
happened
to
advance
guards
before
now
but
all
the
same
we
in
our
own
again
does
that
cheer
you
dick
it
cheered
me
wonderfully
for
i
knew
now
what
had
been
the
weight
on
my
heart
ever
since
i
accepted
sir
walter
mission
it
was
the
loneliness
of
it
i
was
fighting
far
away
from
my
friends
far
away
from
the
true
fronts
of
battle
it
was
a
which
whatever
its
importance
had
none
of
the
exhilaration
of
the
main
effort
but
now
we
had
come
back
to
familiar
ground
we
were
like
the
highlanders
cut
off
at
cite
st
auguste
on
the
first
day
of
loos
or
those
scots
guards
at
festubert
of
whom
i
had
heard
only
the
others
did
not
know
of
it
would
never
hear
of
it
if
peter
succeeded
he
might
tell
the
tale
but
most
likely
he
was
lying
dead
somewhere
in
the
between
the
lines
we
should
never
be
heard
of
again
any
more
but
our
work
remained
sir
walter
would
know
that
and
he
would
tell
our
few
belongings
that
we
had
gone
out
in
our
country
service
we
were
in
the
again
sitting
under
the
parapets
the
same
thoughts
must
have
been
in
sandy
mind
for
he
suddenly
laughed
a
queer
ending
dick
we
simply
vanish
into
the
infinite
if
the
russians
get
through
they
will
never
recognize
what
is
left
of
us
among
so
much
of
the
wreckage
of
battle
the
snow
will
soon
cover
us
and
when
the
spring
comes
there
will
only
be
a
few
bleached
bones
upon
my
soul
it
is
the
kind
of
death
i
always
wanted
and
he
quoted
softly
to
himself
a
verse
of
an
old
scots
ballad
the
ane
for
him
maks
mane
but
nane
sall
ken
whar
he
is
gane
ower
his
white
banes
when
they
are
bare
the
wind
sall
blaw
for
evermair
our
work
lives
i
cried
with
a
sudden
great
gasp
of
happiness
the
job
that
matters
not
the
men
that
do
it
and
our
done
we
have
won
old
chap
won
hands
down
and
there
is
no
going
back
on
that
we
have
won
anyway
and
if
peter
has
had
a
slice
of
luck
we
scooped
the
pool
after
all
we
never
expected
to
come
out
of
this
thing
with
our
lives
blenkiron
with
his
leg
stuck
out
stiffly
before
him
was
humming
quietly
to
himself
as
he
often
did
when
he
felt
cheerful
he
had
only
one
song
brown
body
usually
only
a
line
at
a
time
but
now
he
got
as
far
as
the
whole
verse
captured
harper
ferry
with
his
nineteen
men
so
true
and
he
frightened
old
virginny
till
she
trembled
through
and
through
they
hung
him
for
a
traitor
themselves
the
traitor
crew
but
his
soul
goes
marching
along
good
i
asked
i
about
the
luckiest
man
on
god
earth
major
i
always
wanted
to
get
into
a
big
show
but
i
did
see
how
it
would
come
the
way
of
a
homely
citizen
like
me
living
in
a
house
and
going
down
town
to
my
office
every
morning
i
used
to
envy
my
old
dad
that
fought
at
chattanooga
and
never
forgot
to
tell
you
about
it
but
i
guess
chattanooga
was
like
a
scrap
in
a
bowery
bar
compared
to
this
when
i
meet
the
old
man
in
glory
he
have
to
listen
some
to
me
it
was
just
after
blenkiron
spoke
that
we
got
a
reminder
of
presence
the
gun
was
well
laid
for
a
shell
plumped
on
the
near
edge
of
the
castro
it
made
an
end
of
one
of
the
companions
who
was
on
guard
there
badly
wounded
another
and
a
fragment
gashed
my
thigh
we
took
refuge
in
the
shallow
cave
but
some
wild
shooting
from
the
east
side
brought
us
back
to
the
parapets
for
we
feared
an
attack
none
came
nor
any
more
shells
and
once
again
the
night
was
quiet
i
asked
blenkiron
if
he
had
any
near
relatives
no
except
a
sister
son
a
who
has
no
need
of
his
uncle
it
fortunate
that
we
three
have
no
wives
i
have
any
regrets
neither
for
i
had
a
mighty
deal
out
of
life
i
was
thinking
this
morning
that
it
was
a
pity
i
was
going
out
when
i
had
just
got
my
to
listen
to
reason
but
i
reckon
that
another
of
my
mercies
the
good
god
took
away
the
pain
in
my
stomach
so
that
i
might
go
to
him
with
a
clear
head
and
a
thankful
heart
lucky
fellows
said
sandy
all
had
our
whack
when
i
remember
the
good
times
i
had
i
could
sing
a
hymn
of
praise
lived
long
enough
to
know
ourselves
and
to
shape
ourselves
into
some
kind
of
decency
but
think
of
those
boys
who
have
given
their
lives
freely
when
they
scarcely
knew
what
life
meant
they
were
just
at
the
beginning
of
the
road
and
they
did
know
what
dreary
bits
lay
before
them
it
was
all
sunshiny
and
and
yet
they
gave
it
up
without
a
moment
doubt
and
think
of
the
men
with
wives
and
children
and
homes
that
were
the
biggest
things
in
life
to
them
for
fellows
like
us
to
shirk
would
be
black
cowardice
it
small
credit
for
us
to
stick
it
out
but
when
those
others
shut
their
teeth
and
went
forward
they
were
blessed
heroes
after
that
we
fell
silent
a
man
thoughts
at
a
time
like
that
seem
to
be
and
the
memory
becomes
very
sharp
and
clear
i
do
know
what
was
in
the
others
minds
but
i
know
what
filled
my
own
i
fancy
it
is
the
men
who
get
most
out
of
the
world
and
are
always
buoyant
and
cheerful
that
most
fear
to
die
rather
it
is
the
souls
who
go
about
with
dull
eyes
that
cling
most
fiercely
to
life
they
have
not
the
joy
of
being
alive
which
is
a
kind
of
earnest
of
immortality
i
know
that
my
thoughts
were
chiefly
about
the
jolly
things
that
i
had
seen
and
done
not
regret
but
gratitude
the
panorama
of
blue
noons
on
the
veld
unrolled
itself
before
me
and
hunter
nights
in
the
bush
the
taste
of
food
and
sleep
the
bitter
stimulus
of
dawn
the
joy
of
wild
adventure
the
voices
of
old
staunch
friends
hitherto
the
war
had
seemed
to
make
a
break
with
all
that
had
gone
before
but
now
the
war
was
only
part
of
the
picture
i
thought
of
my
battalion
and
the
good
fellows
there
many
of
whom
had
fallen
on
the
loos
parapets
i
had
never
looked
to
come
out
of
that
myself
but
i
had
been
spared
and
given
the
chance
of
a
greater
business
and
i
had
succeeded
that
was
the
tremendous
fact
and
my
mood
was
humble
gratitude
to
god
and
exultant
pride
death
was
a
small
price
to
pay
for
it
as
blenkiron
would
have
said
i
had
got
good
value
in
the
deal
the
night
was
getting
bitter
cold
as
happens
before
dawn
it
was
frost
again
and
the
sharpness
of
it
woke
our
hunger
i
got
out
the
remnants
of
the
food
and
wine
and
we
had
a
last
meal
i
remember
we
pledged
each
other
as
we
drank
have
eaten
our
passover
feast
said
sandy
do
you
look
for
the
end
dawn
i
said
wants
daylight
to
get
the
full
savour
of
his
revenge
slowly
the
sky
passed
from
ebony
to
grey
and
black
shapes
of
hill
outlined
themselves
against
it
a
wind
blew
down
the
valley
bringing
the
acrid
smell
of
burning
but
something
too
of
the
freshness
of
morn
it
stirred
strange
thoughts
in
me
and
woke
the
old
morning
vigour
of
the
blood
which
was
never
to
be
mine
again
for
the
first
time
in
that
long
vigil
i
was
torn
with
a
sudden
regret
must
get
into
the
cave
before
it
is
full
light
i
said
had
better
draw
lots
for
the
two
to
go
the
choice
fell
on
one
of
the
companions
and
blenkiron
can
count
me
out
said
the
latter
it
your
wish
to
find
a
man
to
be
alive
when
our
friends
come
up
to
count
their
spoil
i
guess
i
the
worst
of
the
lot
i
prefer
if
you
do
mind
to
stay
here
i
made
my
peace
with
my
maker
and
i
like
to
wait
quietly
on
his
call
play
a
game
of
patience
to
pass
the
time
he
would
take
no
denial
so
we
drew
again
and
the
lot
fell
to
sandy
i
the
last
to
go
he
said
promise
i
do
miss
stumm
be
long
in
following
me
he
shook
hands
with
his
cheery
smile
and
he
and
the
companion
slipped
over
the
parapet
in
the
final
shadows
before
dawn
blenkiron
spread
his
patience
cards
on
a
flat
rock
and
dealt
out
the
double
napoleon
he
was
perfectly
calm
and
hummed
to
himself
his
only
tune
for
myself
i
was
drinking
in
my
last
draught
of
the
hill
air
my
contentment
was
going
i
suddenly
felt
bitterly
loath
to
die
something
of
the
same
kind
must
have
passed
through
blenkiron
head
he
suddenly
looked
up
and
asked
anne
sister
anne
do
you
see
anybody
coming
i
stood
close
to
the
parapet
watching
every
detail
of
the
landscape
as
shown
by
the
revealing
daybreak
up
on
the
shoulders
of
the
palantuken
snowdrifts
lipped
over
the
edges
of
the
cliffs
i
wondered
when
they
would
come
down
as
avalanches
there
was
a
kind
of
croft
on
one
hillside
and
from
a
hut
the
smoke
of
breakfast
was
beginning
to
curl
stumm
gunners
were
awake
and
apparently
holding
council
far
down
on
the
main
road
a
convoy
was
moving
i
heard
the
creak
of
the
wheels
two
miles
away
for
the
air
was
deathly
still
then
as
if
a
spring
had
been
loosed
the
world
suddenly
leaped
to
a
hideous
life
with
a
growl
the
guns
opened
round
all
the
horizon
they
were
especially
fierce
to
the
south
where
a
beat
as
i
had
never
heard
it
before
the
one
glance
i
cast
behind
me
showed
the
gap
in
the
hills
choked
with
fumes
and
dust
but
my
eyes
were
on
the
north
from
erzerum
city
tall
tongues
of
flame
leaped
from
a
dozen
quarters
beyond
towards
the
opening
of
the
euphrates
glen
there
was
the
sharp
crack
of
i
strained
eyes
and
ears
mad
with
impatience
and
i
read
the
riddle
i
yelled
has
got
through
the
russians
are
round
the
flank
the
town
is
burning
glory
to
god
we
won
we
won
and
as
i
spoke
the
earth
seemed
to
split
beside
me
and
i
was
flung
forward
on
the
gravel
which
covered
hilda
von
einem
grave
as
i
picked
myself
up
and
to
my
amazement
found
myself
uninjured
i
saw
blenkiron
rubbing
the
dust
out
of
his
eyes
and
arranging
a
disordered
card
he
had
stopped
humming
and
was
singing
aloud
captured
harper
ferry
with
his
nineteen
men
so
true
and
he
frightened
old
virginny
major
he
cried
believe
this
game
of
mine
is
coming
out
i
was
now
pretty
well
mad
the
thought
that
old
peter
had
won
that
we
had
won
beyond
our
wildest
dreams
that
if
we
died
there
were
those
coming
who
would
exact
the
uttermost
vengeance
rode
my
brain
like
a
fever
i
sprang
on
the
parapet
and
waved
my
hand
to
stumm
shouting
defiance
rifle
shots
cracked
out
from
behind
and
i
leaped
back
just
in
time
for
the
next
shell
the
charge
must
have
been
short
for
it
was
a
bad
miss
landing
somewhere
on
the
glacis
the
next
was
better
and
crashed
on
the
near
parapet
carving
a
great
hole
in
the
rocky
this
time
my
arm
hung
limp
broken
by
a
fragment
of
stone
but
i
felt
no
pain
blenkiron
seemed
to
bear
a
charmed
life
for
he
was
smothered
in
dust
but
unhurt
he
blew
the
dust
away
from
his
cards
very
gingerly
and
went
on
playing
then
came
a
dud
which
dropped
neatly
inside
on
the
soft
ground
i
was
determined
to
break
for
the
open
and
chance
the
rifle
fire
for
if
stumm
went
on
shooting
the
was
certain
death
i
caught
blenkiron
round
the
middle
scattering
his
cards
to
the
winds
and
jumped
over
the
parapet
apologize
major
said
he
game
was
as
good
as
won
but
for
god
sake
drop
me
for
if
you
wave
me
like
the
banner
of
freedom
i
get
plugged
sure
and
good
my
one
thought
was
to
get
cover
for
the
next
minutes
for
i
had
an
instinct
that
our
vigil
was
near
its
end
the
defences
of
erzerum
were
crumbling
like
and
it
was
a
proof
of
the
tenseness
of
my
nerves
that
i
seemed
to
be
deaf
to
the
sound
stumm
had
seen
us
cross
the
parapet
and
he
started
to
sprinkle
all
the
surroundings
of
the
blenkiron
and
i
lay
like
a
between
the
lines
caught
by
taking
a
pull
on
ourselves
as
best
we
could
sandy
had
some
kind
of
cover
but
we
were
on
the
bare
farther
slope
and
the
riflemen
on
that
side
might
have
had
us
at
their
mercy
but
no
shots
came
from
them
as
i
looked
east
the
hillside
which
a
little
before
had
been
held
by
our
enemies
was
as
empty
as
the
desert
and
then
i
saw
on
the
main
road
a
sight
which
for
a
second
time
made
me
yell
like
a
maniac
down
that
glen
came
a
throng
of
men
and
galloping
limbers
a
crazy
jostling
crowd
spreading
away
beyond
the
road
to
the
steep
slopes
and
leaving
behind
it
many
black
dots
to
darken
the
snows
the
gates
of
the
south
had
yielded
and
our
friends
were
through
them
at
that
sight
i
forgot
all
about
our
danger
i
did
give
a
cent
for
stumm
shells
i
did
believe
he
could
hit
me
the
fate
which
had
mercifully
preserved
us
for
the
first
taste
of
victory
would
see
us
through
to
the
end
i
remember
bundling
blenkiron
along
the
hill
to
find
sandy
but
our
news
was
anticipated
for
down
our
own
came
the
same
broken
tumult
of
men
more
for
at
their
backs
far
up
at
the
throat
of
the
pass
i
saw
horsemen
the
horsemen
of
the
pursuit
old
nicholas
had
flung
his
cavalry
in
sandy
was
on
his
feet
with
his
lips
set
and
his
eye
abstracted
if
his
face
had
been
burned
black
by
weather
it
would
have
been
pale
as
a
a
man
like
him
does
make
up
his
mind
for
death
and
then
be
given
his
life
again
without
being
wrenched
out
of
his
bearings
i
thought
he
did
understand
what
had
happened
so
i
beat
him
on
the
shoulders
see
i
cried
cossacks
the
cossacks
god
how
they
taking
that
slope
they
into
them
now
by
heaven
ride
with
them
we
get
the
gun
horses
a
little
knoll
prevented
stumm
and
his
men
from
seeing
what
was
happening
farther
up
the
glen
till
the
first
wave
of
the
rout
was
on
them
he
had
gone
on
bombarding
the
and
its
environs
while
the
world
was
cracking
over
his
head
the
gun
team
was
in
the
hollow
below
the
road
and
down
the
hill
among
the
boulders
we
crawled
blenkiron
as
lame
as
a
duck
and
me
with
a
limp
left
arm
the
poor
beasts
were
straining
at
their
pickets
and
sniffing
the
morning
wind
which
brought
down
the
thick
fumes
of
the
great
bombardment
and
the
indescribable
babbling
cries
of
a
beaten
army
before
we
reached
them
that
maddened
horde
had
swept
down
on
them
men
panting
and
gasping
in
their
flight
many
of
them
bloody
from
wounds
many
tottering
in
the
first
stages
of
collapse
and
death
i
saw
the
horses
seized
by
a
dozen
hands
and
a
desperate
fight
for
their
possession
but
as
we
halted
there
our
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
battery
on
the
road
above
us
for
round
it
was
now
sweeping
the
van
of
the
retreat
i
had
never
seen
a
rout
before
when
strong
men
come
to
the
end
of
their
tether
and
only
their
broken
shadows
stumble
towards
the
refuge
they
never
find
no
more
had
stumm
poor
devil
i
had
no
left
for
him
though
coming
down
that
hill
i
was
rather
hoping
that
the
two
of
us
might
have
a
final
scrap
he
was
a
brute
and
a
bully
but
by
god
he
was
a
man
i
heard
his
great
roar
when
he
saw
the
tumult
and
the
next
i
saw
was
his
monstrous
figure
working
at
the
gun
he
swung
it
south
and
turned
it
on
the
fugitives
but
he
never
fired
it
the
press
was
on
him
and
the
gun
was
swept
sideways
he
stood
up
a
foot
higher
than
any
of
them
and
he
seemed
to
be
trying
to
check
the
rush
with
his
pistol
there
is
power
in
numbers
even
though
every
unit
is
broken
and
fleeing
for
a
second
to
that
wild
crowd
stumm
was
the
enemy
and
they
had
strength
enough
to
crush
him
the
wave
flowed
round
and
then
across
him
i
saw
the
of
rifles
crash
on
his
head
and
shoulders
and
the
next
second
the
stream
had
passed
over
his
body
that
was
god
judgement
on
the
man
who
had
set
himself
above
his
kind
sandy
gripped
my
shoulder
and
was
shouting
in
my
ear
coming
dick
look
at
the
grey
devils
oh
god
be
thanked
it
our
friends
the
next
minute
we
were
tumbling
down
the
hillside
blenkiron
hopping
on
one
leg
between
us
i
heard
dimly
sandy
crying
well
done
our
side
and
blenkiron
declaiming
about
harper
ferry
but
i
had
no
voice
at
all
and
no
wish
to
shout
i
know
the
tears
were
in
my
eyes
and
that
if
i
had
been
left
alone
i
would
have
sat
down
and
cried
with
pure
thankfulness
for
sweeping
down
the
glen
came
a
cloud
of
grey
cavalry
on
little
wiry
horses
a
cloud
which
stayed
not
for
the
rear
of
the
fugitives
but
swept
on
like
a
flight
of
rainbows
with
the
steel
of
their
glittering
in
the
winter
sun
they
were
riding
for
erzerum
remember
that
for
three
months
we
had
been
with
the
enemy
and
had
never
seen
the
face
of
an
ally
in
arms
we
had
been
cut
off
from
the
fellowship
of
a
great
cause
like
a
fort
surrounded
by
an
army
and
now
we
were
delivered
and
there
fell
around
us
the
warm
joy
of
comradeship
as
well
as
the
exultation
of
victory
we
flung
caution
to
the
winds
and
went
stark
mad
sandy
still
in
his
emerald
coat
and
turban
was
scrambling
up
the
farther
slope
of
the
hollow
yelling
greetings
in
every
language
known
to
man
the
leader
saw
him
with
a
word
checked
his
men
for
a
moment
it
was
marvellous
to
see
the
horses
reined
in
in
such
a
ride
and
from
the
squadron
half
a
dozen
troopers
swung
loose
and
wheeled
towards
us
then
a
man
in
a
grey
overcoat
and
a
sheepskin
cap
was
on
the
ground
beside
us
wringing
our
hands
are
safe
my
old
friends
it
was
peter
voice
that
spoke
will
take
you
back
to
our
army
and
get
you
breakfast
by
the
lord
you
wo
cried
sandy
had
the
rough
end
of
the
job
and
now
we
have
the
fun
look
after
blenkiron
and
these
fellows
of
mine
i
going
to
ride
knee
by
knee
with
your
sportsmen
for
the
city
peter
spoke
a
word
and
two
of
the
cossacks
dismounted
the
next
i
knew
i
was
mixed
up
in
the
cloud
of
greycoats
galloping
down
the
road
up
which
the
morning
before
we
had
strained
to
the
that
was
the
great
hour
of
my
life
and
to
live
through
it
was
worth
a
dozen
years
of
slavery
with
a
broken
left
arm
i
had
little
hold
on
my
beast
so
i
trusted
my
neck
to
him
and
let
him
have
his
will
black
with
dirt
and
smoke
hatless
with
no
kind
of
uniform
i
was
a
wilder
figure
than
any
cossack
i
soon
was
separated
from
sandy
who
had
two
hands
and
a
better
horse
and
seemed
resolute
to
press
forward
to
the
very
van
that
would
have
been
suicide
for
me
and
i
had
all
i
could
do
to
keep
my
place
in
the
bunch
i
rode
with
but
great
god
what
an
hour
it
was
there
was
loose
shooting
on
our
flank
but
nothing
to
trouble
us
though
the
gun
team
of
some
austrian
howitzer
struggling
madly
at
a
bridge
gave
us
a
bit
of
a
tussle
everything
flitted
past
me
like
smoke
or
like
the
mad
finale
of
a
dream
just
before
waking
i
knew
the
living
movement
under
me
and
the
companionship
of
men
but
all
dimly
for
at
heart
i
was
alone
grappling
with
the
realization
of
a
new
world
i
felt
the
shadows
of
the
palantuken
glen
fading
and
the
great
burst
of
light
as
we
emerged
on
the
wider
valley
somewhere
before
us
was
a
pall
of
smoke
seamed
with
red
flames
and
beyond
the
darkness
of
still
higher
hills
all
that
time
i
was
dreaming
crooning
daft
catches
of
song
to
myself
so
happy
so
deliriously
happy
that
i
dared
not
try
to
think
i
kept
muttering
a
kind
of
prayer
made
up
of
bible
words
to
him
who
had
shown
me
his
goodness
in
the
land
of
the
living
but
as
we
drew
out
from
the
skirts
of
the
hills
and
began
the
long
slope
to
the
city
i
woke
to
clear
consciousness
i
felt
the
smell
of
sheepskin
and
lathered
horses
and
above
all
the
bitter
smell
of
fire
down
in
the
trough
lay
erzerum
now
burning
in
many
places
and
from
the
east
past
the
silent
forts
horsemen
were
closing
in
on
it
i
yelled
to
my
comrades
that
we
were
nearest
that
we
would
be
first
in
the
city
and
they
nodded
happily
and
shouted
their
strange
as
we
topped
the
last
ridge
i
saw
below
me
the
van
of
our
charge
a
dark
mass
on
the
snow
while
the
broken
enemy
on
both
sides
were
flinging
away
their
arms
and
scattering
in
the
fields
in
the
very
front
now
nearing
the
city
ramparts
was
one
man
he
was
like
the
point
of
the
steel
spear
soon
to
be
driven
home
in
the
clear
morning
air
i
could
see
that
he
did
not
wear
the
uniform
of
the
invaders
he
was
turbaned
and
rode
like
one
possessed
and
against
the
snow
i
caught
the
dark
sheen
of
emerald
as
he
rode
it
seemed
that
the
fleeing
turks
were
stricken
still
and
sank
by
the
roadside
with
eyes
strained
after
his
unheeding
figure
then
i
knew
that
the
prophecy
had
been
true
and
that
their
prophet
had
not
failed
them
the
for
revelation
had
come
greenmantle
had
appeared
at
last
to
an
awaiting
people
