dillsborough
i
never
could
understand
why
anybody
should
ever
have
begun
to
live
at
dillsborough
or
why
the
population
there
should
have
been
at
any
time
recruited
by
new
comers
that
a
man
with
a
family
should
cling
to
a
house
in
which
he
has
once
established
himself
is
intelligible
the
butcher
who
supplied
dillsborough
or
the
baker
or
the
ironmonger
though
he
might
not
drive
what
is
called
a
roaring
trade
nevertheless
found
himself
probably
able
to
live
and
might
well
hesitate
before
he
would
encounter
the
dangers
of
a
more
energetic
locality
but
how
it
came
to
pass
that
he
first
got
himself
to
dillsborough
or
his
father
or
his
grandfather
before
him
has
always
been
a
mystery
to
me
the
town
has
no
attractions
and
never
had
any
it
does
not
stand
on
a
bed
of
coal
and
has
no
connection
with
iron
it
has
no
water
peculiarly
adapted
for
beer
or
for
dyeing
or
for
the
cure
of
maladies
it
is
not
surrounded
by
beauty
of
scenery
strong
enough
to
bring
tourists
and
holiday
travellers
there
is
no
cathedral
there
to
form
with
its
bishops
prebendaries
and
minor
canons
the
nucleus
of
a
clerical
circle
it
manufactures
nothing
specially
it
has
no
great
horse
fair
or
cattle
fair
or
even
pig
market
of
special
notoriety
every
saturday
farmers
and
graziers
and
buyers
of
corn
and
sheep
do
congregate
in
a
sleepy
fashion
about
the
streets
but
dillsborough
has
no
character
of
its
own
even
as
a
market
town
its
chief
glory
is
its
parish
church
which
is
ancient
and
inconvenient
having
not
as
yet
received
any
of
those
modern
improvements
which
have
of
late
become
common
throughout
england
but
its
parish
church
though
remarkable
is
hardly
celebrated
the
town
consists
chiefly
of
one
street
which
is
over
a
mile
long
with
a
square
or
in
the
middle
round
which
a
few
lanes
with
queer
old
names
are
congregated
and
a
second
small
open
space
among
these
lanes
in
which
the
church
stands
as
you
pass
along
the
street
away
from
the
railway
station
and
from
london
there
is
a
steep
hill
beginning
to
rise
just
beyond
the
up
to
that
point
it
is
the
high
street
thence
it
is
called
bullock
hill
beyond
that
you
come
to
norrington
road
norrington
being
the
next
town
distant
from
dillsborough
about
twelve
miles
dillsborough
however
stands
in
the
county
of
rufford
whereas
at
the
top
of
bullock
hill
you
enter
the
county
of
ufford
of
which
norrington
is
the
assize
town
the
dillsborough
people
are
therefore
divided
some
two
thousand
five
hundred
of
them
belonging
to
rufford
and
the
remaining
five
hundred
to
the
neighbouring
county
this
accident
has
given
rise
to
not
a
few
feuds
ufford
being
a
large
county
with
pottery
and
ribbons
and
watches
going
on
in
the
farther
confines
whereas
rufford
is
small
and
thoroughly
agricultural
the
men
at
the
top
of
hill
are
therefore
disposed
to
think
themselves
better
than
their
though
they
are
small
in
number
and
not
specially
thriving
in
their
circumstances
at
every
interval
of
ten
years
when
the
census
is
taken
the
population
of
dillsborough
is
always
found
to
have
fallen
off
in
some
slight
degree
for
a
few
months
after
the
publication
of
the
figures
a
slight
tinge
of
melancholy
comes
upon
the
town
the
landlord
of
the
bush
inn
who
is
really
an
enterprising
man
in
his
way
and
who
has
looked
about
in
every
direction
for
new
sources
of
business
becomes
taciturn
for
a
while
and
forgets
to
smile
upon
comers
ribbs
the
butcher
tells
his
wife
that
it
is
out
of
the
question
that
she
and
the
children
should
take
that
journey
to
the
and
gregory
masters
the
attorney
of
dillsborough
whispers
to
some
confidential
friend
that
he
might
as
well
take
down
his
plate
and
shut
up
his
house
but
in
a
month
or
two
all
that
is
forgotten
and
new
hopes
spring
up
even
in
dillsborough
runciman
at
the
bush
is
putting
up
new
stables
for
that
being
the
special
trade
for
which
he
now
finds
that
there
is
an
opening
ribbs
is
again
allowed
to
suggest
and
masters
goes
on
as
he
has
done
for
the
last
forty
years
making
the
best
he
can
of
a
decreasing
business
dillsborough
is
built
chiefly
of
brick
and
is
in
its
own
way
solid
enough
the
bush
which
in
the
time
of
the
present
father
was
one
of
the
best
posting
inns
on
the
road
is
not
only
substantial
but
almost
handsome
a
broad
coach
way
cut
through
the
middle
of
the
house
leads
into
a
spacious
clean
yard
and
on
each
side
of
the
coach
way
there
are
bay
windows
looking
into
the
street
the
one
belonging
to
the
commercial
parlour
and
the
other
to
the
but
the
has
in
truth
fallen
away
from
its
former
purposes
and
is
now
used
for
a
ordinary
on
market
days
and
other
similar
purposes
travellers
who
require
the
use
of
a
public
must
all
congregate
in
the
commercial
parlour
at
the
bush
so
far
the
interior
of
the
house
has
fallen
from
its
past
greatness
but
the
exterior
is
maintained
with
much
care
the
brickwork
up
to
the
eaves
is
well
pointed
fresh
and
comfortable
to
look
at
in
front
of
the
swings
on
two
massive
supports
the
old
sign
of
the
bush
as
to
which
it
may
be
doubted
whether
even
runciman
himself
knows
that
it
has
swung
there
or
been
displayed
in
some
fashion
since
it
was
the
custom
for
the
landlord
to
beat
up
wine
to
freshen
it
before
it
was
given
to
the
customers
to
drink
the
church
too
is
of
brick
though
the
tower
and
chancel
are
of
stone
the
attorney
house
is
of
brick
which
shall
not
be
more
particularly
described
now
as
many
of
the
scenes
which
these
pages
will
have
to
describe
were
acted
there
and
almost
the
entire
high
street
in
the
centre
of
the
town
was
brick
also
but
the
most
remarkable
house
in
dillsborough
was
one
standing
in
a
short
thoroughfare
called
hobbs
gate
leading
down
by
the
side
of
the
bush
inn
from
the
to
church
square
as
it
is
called
as
you
pass
down
towards
the
church
this
house
is
on
the
right
hand
and
it
occupies
with
its
garden
the
whole
space
between
the
and
church
square
but
though
the
house
enjoys
the
privilege
of
a
large
garden
so
large
that
the
land
being
in
the
middle
of
a
town
would
be
of
great
value
were
it
not
that
dillsborough
is
in
its
decadence
still
it
stands
flush
up
to
the
street
upon
which
the
front
door
opens
it
has
an
imposing
flight
of
stone
steps
guarded
by
iron
rails
leading
up
to
it
and
on
each
side
of
the
door
there
is
a
row
of
three
windows
and
on
the
two
upper
stories
rows
of
seven
windows
over
the
door
there
is
a
covering
on
which
there
are
carved
wooden
faces
and
over
the
centre
of
each
window
let
into
the
brickwork
is
a
carved
stone
there
are
also
numerous
underground
windows
sunk
below
the
earth
and
protected
by
iron
railings
altogether
the
house
is
one
which
can
not
fail
to
attract
attention
and
in
the
brickwork
is
clearly
marked
the
date
not
the
very
best
period
for
english
architecture
as
regards
beauty
but
one
in
which
walls
and
roofs
ceilings
and
buttresses
were
built
more
substantially
than
they
are
this
was
the
only
house
in
dillsborough
which
had
a
name
of
its
own
and
it
was
called
hoppet
hall
the
dillsborough
chronicles
telling
that
it
had
been
originally
built
for
and
inhabited
by
the
hoppet
family
the
only
hoppet
now
left
in
dillsborough
is
old
joe
hoppet
the
ostler
at
the
bush
and
the
house
as
was
well
known
had
belonged
to
some
member
of
the
morton
family
for
the
last
hundred
years
at
least
the
garden
and
ground
it
stands
upon
comprise
three
acres
all
of
which
are
surrounded
by
a
high
brick
wall
which
is
supposed
to
be
coeval
with
the
house
the
best
ribston
pippins
some
people
say
the
only
real
ribston
pippins
in
all
rufford
are
to
be
found
here
and
its
burgundy
pears
and
walnuts
are
almost
equally
celebrated
there
are
rumours
also
that
its
roses
beat
everything
in
the
way
of
roses
for
ten
miles
round
but
in
these
days
very
few
strangers
are
admitted
to
see
the
hoppet
hall
roses
the
pears
and
apples
do
make
their
way
out
and
are
distributed
either
by
masters
the
attorney
wife
or
runciman
the
innkeeper
the
present
occupier
of
the
house
is
a
certain
reginald
morton
with
whom
we
shall
also
be
much
concerned
in
these
pages
but
whose
introduction
to
the
reader
shall
be
postponed
for
awhile
the
land
around
dillsborough
is
chiefly
owned
by
two
landlords
of
whom
the
greatest
and
richest
is
lord
rufford
he
however
does
not
live
near
the
town
but
away
at
the
other
side
of
the
county
and
is
not
much
seen
in
these
parts
unless
when
the
hounds
bring
him
here
or
when
with
two
or
three
friends
he
will
sometimes
stay
for
a
few
days
at
the
bush
inn
for
the
sake
of
shooting
the
coverts
he
is
much
liked
by
all
sporting
men
but
is
not
otherwise
very
popular
with
the
people
round
dillsborough
a
landlord
if
he
wishes
to
be
popular
should
be
seen
frequently
if
he
lives
among
his
farmers
they
will
swear
by
him
even
though
he
raises
his
rental
every
ten
or
twelve
years
and
never
puts
a
new
roof
to
a
barn
for
them
lord
rufford
is
a
rich
man
who
thinks
of
nothing
but
sport
in
all
its
various
shapes
from
at
hurlingham
to
the
slaughter
of
elephants
in
africa
and
though
he
is
lenient
in
all
his
dealings
is
not
much
thought
of
in
the
dillsborough
side
of
the
county
except
by
those
who
go
out
with
the
hounds
at
rufford
where
he
generally
has
a
full
house
for
three
months
in
the
year
and
spends
a
vast
amount
of
money
he
is
more
highly
considered
the
other
extensive
landlord
is
john
morton
a
young
man
who
in
spite
of
his
position
as
squire
of
bragton
owner
of
bragton
park
and
landlord
of
the
entire
parishes
of
bragton
and
mallingham
the
latter
of
which
comes
close
up
to
the
confines
of
dillsborough
was
at
the
time
at
which
our
story
begins
secretary
of
legation
at
washington
as
he
had
been
an
absentee
since
he
came
of
age
soon
after
which
time
he
inherited
the
property
he
had
been
almost
less
liked
in
the
neighbourhood
than
the
lord
indeed
no
one
in
dillsborough
knew
much
about
him
although
bragton
hall
was
but
four
miles
from
the
town
and
the
mortons
had
possessed
the
property
and
lived
on
it
for
the
last
three
centuries
but
there
had
been
extravagance
as
will
hereafter
have
to
be
told
and
there
had
been
no
continuous
residence
at
bragton
since
the
death
of
old
reginald
morton
who
had
been
the
best
known
and
the
best
loved
of
all
the
squires
in
rufford
and
had
for
many
years
been
master
of
the
rufford
hounds
he
had
lived
to
a
very
great
age
and
though
the
of
the
present
man
had
not
been
dead
above
twenty
years
he
was
the
man
of
whom
the
older
inhabitants
of
dillsborough
and
the
neighbourhood
still
thought
and
still
spoke
when
they
gave
vent
to
their
feelings
in
favour
of
gentlemen
and
yet
the
old
squire
in
his
latter
days
had
been
able
to
do
little
or
nothing
for
them
being
sometimes
backward
as
to
the
payment
of
money
he
owed
among
them
but
he
had
lived
all
his
days
at
bragton
park
and
his
figure
had
been
familiar
to
all
eyes
in
the
high
street
of
dillsborough
and
at
the
front
entrance
of
the
bush
people
still
spoke
of
old
reginald
morton
as
though
his
death
had
been
a
sore
loss
to
the
neighbourhood
and
there
were
in
the
country
round
sundry
yeomen
as
they
ought
to
be
called
as
they
now
like
to
style
themselves
men
who
owned
some
acres
of
land
and
farmed
these
acres
themselves
of
these
we
may
specially
mention
lawrence
twentyman
who
was
quite
the
he
possessed
over
three
hundred
acres
of
land
on
which
his
father
had
built
an
excellent
house
the
present
twentyman
lawrence
twentyman
esquire
as
he
was
called
by
everybody
was
by
no
means
unpopular
in
the
neighbourhood
he
not
only
rode
well
to
hounds
but
paid
pounds
annually
to
the
hunt
which
entitled
him
to
feel
quite
at
home
in
his
red
coat
he
generally
owned
a
racing
colt
or
two
and
attended
meetings
but
was
supposed
to
know
what
he
was
about
and
to
have
kept
safely
the
five
or
six
thousand
pounds
which
his
father
had
left
him
and
his
farming
was
well
done
for
though
he
was
a
he
knew
how
to
get
the
full
worth
in
work
done
for
the
fourteen
shillings
a
week
which
he
paid
to
his
labourers
a
deficiency
in
which
knowledge
is
the
cause
why
gentlemen
in
general
find
farming
so
expensive
an
amusement
he
was
a
handsome
man
of
about
thirty
and
would
have
been
a
happy
man
had
he
not
been
too
ambitious
in
his
aspirations
after
gentry
he
had
been
at
school
for
three
years
at
cheltenham
college
which
together
with
his
money
and
appearance
and
undoubted
freehold
property
should
he
thought
have
made
his
position
quite
secure
to
him
but
though
he
sometimes
called
young
hampton
of
hampton
wick
hampton
and
the
son
of
the
rector
of
dillsborough
mainwaring
and
always
called
the
rich
young
brewers
from
norrington
botsey
partners
in
the
firm
of
billbrook
botsey
and
though
they
in
return
called
him
larry
and
admitted
the
intimacy
still
he
did
not
get
into
their
houses
and
lord
rufford
when
he
came
into
the
neighbourhood
never
asked
him
to
dine
at
the
bush
and
worst
of
all
some
of
the
sporting
men
and
others
in
the
neighbourhood
who
decidedly
were
not
gentlemen
also
called
him
larry
runciman
always
did
so
twenty
or
years
ago
runciman
had
been
his
father
special
friend
before
the
house
had
been
built
and
before
the
days
at
cheltenham
college
remembering
this
lawrence
was
too
good
a
fellow
to
rebuke
runciman
but
to
younger
men
of
that
class
he
would
sometimes
make
himself
objectionable
there
was
another
keeper
of
hunting
stables
a
younger
man
named
stubbings
living
at
stanton
corner
a
great
hunting
rendezvous
about
four
miles
from
dillsborough
and
not
long
since
twentyman
had
threatened
to
lay
his
whip
across
stubbings
shoulders
if
stubbings
ever
called
him
larry
again
stubbings
who
was
a
little
man
and
rode
races
only
laughed
at
twentyman
who
was
six
feet
high
and
told
the
story
round
to
all
the
hunt
twentyman
was
more
laughed
at
than
perhaps
he
deserved
a
man
should
not
have
his
christian
name
used
by
every
tom
and
dick
without
his
sanction
but
the
difficulty
is
one
to
which
men
in
the
position
of
lawrence
twentyman
are
often
subject
those
whom
i
have
named
together
with
mainwaring
the
rector
and
surtees
his
curate
made
up
the
very
sparse
aristocracy
of
dillsborough
the
hamptons
of
hampton
wick
were
ufford
men
and
belonged
rather
to
norrington
than
dillsborough
the
botseys
also
from
norrington
were
members
of
the
or
ufford
and
rufford
united
hunt
club
but
they
did
not
much
affect
dillsborough
as
a
town
mainwaring
who
has
been
mentioned
lived
in
another
brick
house
behind
the
church
the
old
parsonage
of
john
there
was
also
a
mainwaring
but
she
was
an
invalid
their
family
consisted
of
one
son
who
was
at
brasenose
at
this
time
he
always
had
a
horse
during
the
christmas
vacation
and
if
rumour
did
not
belie
him
kept
two
or
three
up
at
oxford
surtees
the
curate
lived
in
lodgings
in
the
town
he
was
a
painstaking
eager
clever
young
man
with
aspirations
in
church
matters
which
were
always
being
checked
by
his
rector
quieta
non
movere
was
the
motto
by
which
the
rector
governed
his
life
and
he
certainly
was
not
at
all
the
man
to
allow
his
curate
to
drive
him
into
activity
such
at
the
time
of
our
story
was
the
little
town
of
dillsborough
chapter
ii
the
morton
family
i
can
hardly
describe
accurately
the
exact
position
of
the
masters
family
without
first
telling
all
that
i
know
about
the
morton
family
and
it
is
absolutely
essential
that
the
reader
should
know
all
the
masters
family
intimately
masters
as
i
have
said
in
the
last
chapter
was
the
attorney
in
dillsborough
and
the
mortons
had
been
for
centuries
past
the
squires
of
bragton
i
need
not
take
the
reader
back
farther
than
old
reginald
morton
he
had
come
to
the
throne
of
his
family
as
a
young
man
and
had
sat
upon
it
for
more
than
half
a
century
he
had
been
a
squire
of
the
old
times
having
no
inclination
for
london
seasons
never
wishing
to
keep
up
a
second
house
quite
content
with
his
position
as
squire
of
bragton
but
with
considerable
pride
about
him
as
to
that
position
he
had
always
liked
to
have
his
house
full
and
had
hated
petty
oeconomies
he
had
for
many
years
hunted
the
county
at
his
own
expense
the
amusement
at
first
not
having
been
so
expensive
as
it
afterwards
became
when
he
began
the
work
it
had
been
considered
sufficient
to
hunt
twice
a
week
now
the
rufford
and
ufford
hounds
have
four
days
and
sometimes
a
bye
it
went
much
against
reginald
morton
pride
when
he
was
first
driven
to
take
a
subscription
but
the
temporary
distress
into
which
the
family
fell
was
caused
not
so
much
by
his
own
extravagance
as
by
that
of
two
sons
and
by
his
indulgence
in
regard
to
them
he
had
three
children
none
of
whom
were
very
fortunate
in
life
the
eldest
john
married
the
daughter
of
a
peer
stood
for
parliament
had
one
son
and
died
before
he
was
forty
owing
something
over
the
estate
was
then
worth
a
year
certain
lands
not
lying
either
in
bragton
or
mallingham
were
sold
and
that
difficulty
was
surmounted
not
without
a
considerable
diminution
of
income
in
process
of
time
the
grandson
who
was
a
second
john
morton
grew
up
and
married
and
became
the
father
of
a
third
john
morton
the
young
man
who
afterwards
became
owner
of
the
property
and
secretary
of
legation
at
washington
but
the
old
squire
outlived
his
son
and
his
grandson
and
when
he
died
had
three
or
four
playing
about
the
lawns
of
bragton
park
the
peer
daughter
had
lived
and
had
for
many
years
drawn
a
dower
from
the
bragton
property
and
had
been
altogether
a
very
heavy
incumbrance
but
the
great
trial
of
the
old
man
life
as
also
the
great
romance
had
arisen
from
the
career
of
his
second
son
reginald
of
all
his
children
reginald
had
been
the
dearest
to
him
he
went
to
oxford
and
had
there
spent
much
money
not
as
young
men
now
spend
money
but
still
to
an
extent
that
had
been
grievous
to
the
old
squire
but
everything
was
always
paid
for
reginald
it
was
necessary
of
course
that
he
should
have
a
profession
and
he
took
a
commission
in
the
army
as
a
young
man
he
went
to
canada
this
was
in
when
all
the
world
was
at
peace
and
his
only
achievement
in
canada
was
to
marry
a
young
woman
who
is
reported
to
have
been
pretty
and
good
but
who
had
no
advantages
either
of
fortune
or
birth
she
was
indeed
the
daughter
of
a
bankrupt
innkeeper
in
montreal
soon
after
this
he
sold
out
and
brought
his
wife
home
to
bragton
it
was
at
this
period
of
the
squire
life
that
the
romance
spoken
of
occurred
john
morton
the
brother
with
the
aristocratic
wife
was
ten
or
twelve
years
older
than
reginald
and
at
this
time
lived
chiefly
at
bragton
when
he
was
not
in
town
he
was
perhaps
justified
in
regarding
bragton
as
almost
belonging
to
him
knowing
as
he
did
that
it
must
belong
to
him
after
his
father
lifetime
and
to
his
son
after
him
his
anger
against
his
brother
was
hot
and
that
of
his
wife
still
hotter
he
himself
had
squandered
thousands
but
then
he
was
the
heir
reginald
who
was
only
a
younger
brother
had
sold
his
commission
and
then
he
had
done
so
much
more
than
this
he
had
married
a
woman
who
was
not
a
lady
john
was
clearly
of
opinion
that
at
any
rate
the
wife
should
not
be
admitted
into
bragton
house
the
old
squire
in
those
days
was
not
a
happy
man
he
had
never
been
very
but
now
he
was
strong
enough
to
declare
that
his
should
not
be
shut
against
a
son
of
his
or
a
wife
as
long
as
she
was
honest
hereupon
the
honourable
morton
took
her
departure
and
was
never
seen
at
bragton
again
in
the
old
squire
time
reginald
morton
came
to
the
house
and
soon
afterwards
another
little
reginald
was
born
at
bragton
park
this
happened
as
long
ago
as
twenty
years
before
the
death
of
the
old
squire
but
there
had
been
another
child
a
daughter
who
had
come
between
the
two
sons
still
living
in
these
days
who
will
become
known
to
any
reader
who
will
have
patience
to
follow
these
pages
to
the
end
she
married
not
very
early
in
life
a
certain
sir
william
ushant
who
was
employed
by
his
country
in
india
and
elsewhere
but
who
found
soon
after
his
marriage
that
the
service
of
his
country
required
that
he
should
generally
leave
his
wife
at
bragton
as
her
father
had
been
for
many
years
a
widower
lady
ushant
became
the
mistress
of
the
house
but
death
was
very
busy
with
the
mortons
almost
every
one
died
except
the
squire
himself
and
his
daughter
and
that
honourable
dowager
with
her
income
and
her
pride
who
could
certainly
very
well
have
been
spared
when
at
last
in
the
old
squire
went
full
of
years
full
of
respect
but
laden
also
with
debts
and
money
troubles
not
only
had
his
son
john
and
his
grandson
john
gone
before
him
but
reginald
and
his
wife
were
both
lying
in
bragton
churchyard
the
elder
branch
of
the
family
john
the
and
his
little
sisters
were
at
once
taken
away
from
bragton
by
the
honourable
grandmother
john
who
was
then
about
seven
years
old
was
of
course
the
young
squire
and
was
the
owner
of
the
property
the
dowager
therefore
did
not
undertake
an
altogether
unprofitable
burden
lady
ushant
was
left
at
the
house
and
with
lady
ushant
or
rather
immediately
subject
to
her
care
young
reginald
morton
who
was
then
nineteen
years
of
age
and
who
was
about
to
go
to
oxford
but
there
immediately
sprang
up
family
lawsuits
instigated
by
the
honourable
lady
on
behalf
of
her
grandchildren
of
which
reginald
morton
was
the
object
the
old
man
had
left
certain
outlying
properties
to
his
grandson
reginald
of
which
hoppet
hall
was
a
part
for
eight
or
ten
years
the
lawsuit
was
continued
and
much
money
was
expended
reginald
was
at
last
successful
and
became
the
undoubted
owner
of
hoppet
hall
but
in
the
meantime
he
went
to
germany
for
his
education
instead
of
to
oxford
and
remained
abroad
even
after
the
matter
was
decided
living
no
one
but
lady
ushant
knew
where
or
after
what
fashion
when
the
old
squire
died
the
children
were
taken
away
and
bragton
was
nearly
deserted
the
young
heir
was
brought
up
with
every
caution
and
under
the
auspices
of
his
grandmother
and
her
family
behaved
himself
very
unlike
the
old
mortons
he
was
educated
at
eton
after
leaving
which
he
was
at
once
examined
for
foreign
office
employment
and
commenced
his
career
with
great
éclat
he
had
been
made
to
understand
clearly
that
it
would
be
better
that
he
should
not
enter
in
upon
his
squirearchy
early
in
life
the
estate
when
he
came
of
age
had
already
had
some
years
to
recover
itself
and
as
he
went
from
capital
to
capital
he
was
quite
content
to
draw
from
it
an
income
which
enabled
him
to
shine
with
peculiar
brilliance
among
his
brethren
he
had
visited
bragton
once
since
the
old
squire
death
and
had
found
the
place
very
dull
and
uninviting
he
had
no
ambition
whatever
to
be
master
of
the
but
did
look
forward
to
a
time
when
he
might
be
minister
plenipotentiary
at
some
foreign
court
for
many
years
after
the
old
man
death
lady
ushant
who
was
then
a
widow
was
allowed
to
live
at
bragton
she
was
herself
childless
and
being
now
robbed
of
her
and
nieces
took
a
little
girl
to
live
with
her
named
mary
masters
it
was
a
very
desolate
house
in
those
days
but
the
old
lady
was
careful
as
to
the
education
of
the
child
and
did
her
best
to
make
the
home
happy
for
her
some
two
or
three
years
before
the
commencement
of
this
story
there
arose
a
difference
between
the
manager
of
the
property
and
lady
ushant
and
she
was
made
to
understand
after
some
manner
that
bragton
house
and
park
would
do
better
without
her
there
would
be
no
longer
any
cows
kept
and
painters
must
come
into
the
house
and
there
were
difficulties
about
fuel
she
was
not
turned
out
exactly
but
she
went
and
established
herself
in
lonely
lodgings
at
cheltenham
then
mary
masters
who
had
lived
for
more
than
a
dozen
years
at
bragton
went
back
to
her
father
house
in
dillsborough
any
reader
with
an
aptitude
for
family
pedigrees
will
now
understand
that
reginald
master
of
hoppet
hall
was
first
cousin
to
the
father
of
the
foreign
office
paragon
and
that
he
is
therefore
the
first
cousin
once
removed
the
relationship
is
not
very
distant
but
the
two
men
one
of
whom
was
a
dozen
years
older
than
the
other
had
not
seen
each
other
for
more
than
twenty
years
at
a
time
when
one
of
them
was
a
big
boy
and
the
other
a
very
little
one
and
during
the
greater
part
of
that
time
a
lawsuit
had
been
carried
on
between
them
in
a
very
rigorous
manner
it
had
done
much
to
injure
both
and
had
created
such
a
feeling
of
hostility
that
no
intercourse
of
any
kind
now
existed
between
them
it
does
not
much
concern
us
to
know
how
far
back
should
be
dated
the
beginning
of
the
connection
between
the
morton
family
and
that
of
masters
the
attorney
but
it
is
certain
that
the
first
attorney
of
that
name
in
dillsborough
became
learned
in
the
law
through
the
patronage
of
some
former
morton
the
father
of
the
present
gregory
masters
and
the
grandfather
had
been
thoroughly
trusted
and
employed
by
old
reginald
morton
and
the
former
of
the
two
had
made
his
will
very
much
of
the
stewardship
and
management
of
the
property
had
been
in
their
hands
and
they
had
thriven
as
honest
men
but
as
men
with
a
tolerably
sharp
eye
to
their
own
interests
the
late
masters
had
died
a
few
years
before
the
squire
and
the
present
attorney
had
seemed
to
succeed
to
these
family
blessings
but
the
whole
order
of
things
became
changed
within
a
few
weeks
of
the
squire
death
masters
found
that
he
was
to
be
entrusted
no
further
with
the
affairs
of
the
property
but
that
in
lieu
of
such
care
was
thrown
upon
him
the
task
of
defending
the
will
which
he
had
made
against
the
owner
of
the
estate
his
father
and
grandfather
had
contrived
between
them
to
establish
a
fairly
good
business
independently
of
bragton
which
business
of
course
was
now
his
as
far
as
reading
went
and
knowledge
he
was
probably
a
better
lawyer
than
either
of
them
but
he
lacked
their
enterprise
and
special
genius
and
the
thing
had
dwindled
with
him
it
seemed
to
him
perhaps
not
unnaturally
that
he
had
been
robbed
of
an
inheritance
he
had
no
title
deeds
as
had
the
owners
of
the
property
but
his
ancestors
before
him
from
generation
to
generation
had
lived
by
managing
the
bragton
property
they
had
drawn
the
leases
and
made
the
wills
and
collected
the
rents
and
had
taught
themselves
to
believe
that
a
morton
could
not
live
on
his
land
without
a
masters
now
there
was
a
morton
who
did
not
live
on
his
land
but
spent
his
rents
elsewhere
without
the
aid
of
any
masters
and
it
seemed
to
the
old
lawyer
that
all
the
good
things
of
the
world
had
passed
away
he
had
married
twice
his
first
wife
having
before
her
marriage
been
well
known
at
bragton
park
when
she
had
died
and
masters
had
brought
a
second
wife
home
lady
ushant
took
the
only
child
of
the
mother
whom
she
had
known
as
a
girl
into
her
own
keeping
till
she
also
had
been
compelled
to
leave
bragton
then
mary
masters
had
returned
to
her
father
and
stepmother
the
bragton
park
residence
is
a
large
comfortable
house
but
by
no
means
a
magnificent
mansion
the
greater
part
of
it
was
built
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
and
the
rooms
are
small
and
low
in
the
palmy
days
of
his
reign
which
is
now
more
than
half
a
century
since
the
old
squire
made
alterations
and
built
new
stables
and
kennels
and
put
up
a
conservatory
but
what
he
did
then
has
already
become
almost
now
what
he
added
he
added
in
stone
but
the
old
house
was
brick
he
was
much
abused
at
the
time
for
his
want
of
taste
and
heard
a
good
deal
about
putting
new
cloth
as
patches
on
old
rents
but
as
the
shrubs
and
ivy
have
grown
up
a
certain
picturesqueness
has
come
upon
the
place
which
is
greatly
due
to
the
difference
of
material
the
place
is
somewhat
sombre
as
there
is
no
garden
close
to
the
house
there
is
a
lawn
at
the
back
with
gravel
walks
round
it
but
it
is
only
a
small
lawn
and
then
divided
from
the
lawn
by
a
fence
is
the
park
the
place
too
has
that
sad
look
which
always
comes
to
a
house
from
the
want
of
a
tenant
poor
lady
ushant
when
she
was
there
could
do
little
or
nothing
a
gardener
was
kept
but
there
should
have
been
three
or
four
gardeners
the
man
grew
cabbages
and
onions
which
he
sold
but
cared
nothing
for
the
walks
or
borders
whatever
it
may
have
been
in
the
old
time
bragton
park
was
certainly
not
a
cheerful
place
when
lady
ushant
lived
there
in
the
squire
time
the
park
itself
had
always
been
occupied
by
deer
even
when
distress
came
he
would
not
allow
the
deer
to
be
sold
but
after
his
death
they
went
very
soon
and
from
that
day
to
the
time
of
which
i
am
writing
the
park
has
been
leased
to
some
butchers
or
graziers
from
dillsborough
the
ground
hereabouts
is
nearly
level
but
it
falls
away
a
little
and
becomes
broken
and
pretty
where
the
river
dill
runs
through
the
park
about
half
a
mile
from
the
house
there
is
a
walk
called
the
pleasance
passing
down
through
shrubs
to
the
river
and
then
crossing
the
stream
by
a
and
leading
across
the
fields
towards
dillsborough
this
bridge
is
perhaps
the
prettiest
spot
in
bragton
or
for
that
matter
anywhere
in
the
county
round
but
even
here
there
is
not
much
of
beauty
to
be
praised
it
is
here
on
the
side
of
the
river
away
from
the
house
that
the
home
meet
of
the
hounds
used
to
be
held
and
still
the
meet
at
bragton
bridge
is
popular
in
the
county
chapter
iii
the
masters
family
at
six
one
november
evening
masters
the
attorney
was
sitting
at
home
with
his
family
in
the
large
parlour
of
his
house
his
office
being
on
the
other
side
of
the
passage
which
cut
the
house
in
two
and
was
formally
called
the
hall
upstairs
over
the
parlour
was
a
but
this
chamber
which
was
supposed
to
be
elegantly
furnished
was
very
rarely
used
and
masters
did
not
see
much
company
and
for
family
purposes
the
elegance
of
the
made
it
unfit
it
added
however
not
a
little
to
the
glory
of
masters
life
the
house
itself
was
a
low
brick
building
in
the
high
street
at
the
corner
where
the
high
street
runs
into
the
and
therefore
nearly
opposite
to
the
bush
it
had
none
of
the
elaborate
grandeur
of
the
inn
nor
of
the
simple
stateliness
of
hoppet
hall
but
nevertheless
it
maintained
the
character
of
the
town
and
was
old
substantial
respectable
and
dark
i
think
it
a
very
spirited
thing
of
him
to
do
then
said
masters
i
do
know
my
dear
perhaps
it
is
only
revenge
what
have
you
to
do
with
that
what
can
it
matter
to
a
lawyer
whether
it
revenge
or
anything
else
he
got
the
means
i
suppose
i
do
know
my
dear
what
does
nickem
say
i
suppose
he
has
the
means
said
masters
who
was
aware
that
if
he
told
his
wife
a
fib
on
the
matter
she
would
learn
the
truth
from
his
senior
clerk
samuel
nickem
among
the
professional
gifts
which
masters
possessed
had
not
been
that
great
gift
of
being
able
to
keep
his
office
and
his
family
distinct
from
each
other
his
wife
always
knew
what
was
going
on
and
was
very
free
with
her
advice
generally
tendering
it
on
that
side
on
which
money
was
to
be
made
and
doing
so
with
much
feminine
darkness
as
to
right
or
wrong
his
clerk
nickem
who
was
afflicted
with
no
such
darkness
but
who
ridiculed
the
idea
of
scruple
in
an
attorney
often
took
part
against
him
it
was
the
wish
of
his
heart
to
get
rid
of
nickem
but
nickem
would
have
carried
business
with
him
and
gone
over
to
some
enemy
or
perhaps
have
set
up
in
some
irregular
manner
on
his
own
bottom
and
his
wife
would
have
given
him
no
peace
had
he
done
so
for
she
regarded
nickem
as
the
mainstay
of
the
house
what
is
lord
rufford
to
you
asked
masters
he
has
always
been
very
friendly
i
do
see
it
at
all
you
have
never
had
any
of
his
money
i
know
that
you
are
a
pound
richer
by
him
i
have
always
gone
with
the
gentry
of
the
county
fiddlesticks
gentry
gentry
are
very
well
as
long
as
you
can
make
a
living
out
of
them
you
could
afford
to
stick
up
for
gentry
till
you
lost
the
bragton
property
this
was
a
subject
that
was
always
sore
between
masters
and
his
wife
the
former
masters
had
been
a
lady
the
daughter
of
a
neighbouring
clergyman
and
had
been
much
considered
by
the
family
at
bragton
the
present
masters
was
the
daughter
of
an
ironmonger
at
norrington
who
had
brought
a
thousand
pounds
with
her
which
had
been
very
useful
no
doubt
practice
had
been
considerably
affected
by
the
lowliness
of
his
second
marriage
people
who
used
to
know
the
first
masters
such
as
mainwaring
and
the
doctor
wife
and
old
cooper
the
wife
of
the
vicar
of
mallingham
would
not
call
on
the
second
masters
as
masters
was
too
to
run
after
people
who
did
not
want
her
she
took
to
hating
gentry
instead
we
have
always
been
on
the
other
side
said
the
old
attorney
i
and
my
father
and
grandfather
before
me
they
lived
on
it
and
you
ca
if
you
are
going
to
say
that
you
wo
have
any
client
that
is
a
gentleman
you
might
as
well
put
up
your
shutters
at
once
i
have
said
so
is
runciman
my
client
he
always
goes
with
the
gentry
he
thinks
he
one
of
them
himself
and
old
nobbs
the
greengrocer
but
it
all
nonsense
any
man
is
my
client
or
any
woman
who
can
come
and
pay
me
for
business
that
is
fit
for
me
to
do
why
is
this
fit
to
be
done
if
the
man
been
damaged
why
should
he
be
paid
he
had
money
offered
him
if
he
thinks
it
ai
enough
who
to
say
that
it
is
unless
a
jury
said
masters
becoming
quite
eloquent
and
how
a
poor
man
to
get
a
jury
to
say
that
unless
he
comes
to
a
lawyer
of
course
if
you
wo
have
it
he
go
to
bearside
bearside
turn
him
away
bearside
was
another
attorney
an
interloper
of
about
ten
years
standing
whose
name
was
odious
to
masters
you
do
know
anything
about
it
my
dear
said
he
aroused
at
last
to
anger
i
know
you
letting
anybody
who
likes
take
the
bread
out
of
the
children
mouths
the
children
so
called
were
sitting
round
the
table
and
could
not
but
take
an
interest
in
the
matter
the
eldest
was
that
mary
masters
the
daughter
of
the
former
wife
whom
lady
ushant
had
befriended
a
tall
girl
with
dark
brown
hair
so
dark
as
almost
to
be
black
and
large
soft
thoughtful
grey
eyes
we
shall
have
much
to
say
of
mary
masters
and
can
hardly
stop
to
give
an
adequate
description
of
her
here
the
others
were
dolly
and
kate
two
girls
aged
sixteen
and
fifteen
the
two
younger
children
were
eating
bread
and
butter
and
jam
in
a
very
healthy
manner
but
still
had
their
ears
wide
open
to
the
conversation
that
was
being
held
the
two
younger
girls
sympathised
strongly
with
their
mother
mary
who
had
known
much
about
the
mortons
and
was
old
enough
to
understand
the
position
which
her
grandfather
had
held
in
reference
to
the
family
of
course
leaned
in
her
heart
to
her
father
side
but
she
was
wiser
than
her
father
and
knew
that
in
such
discussions
her
mother
often
showed
a
worldly
wisdom
which
in
their
present
circumstances
they
could
hardly
afford
to
disregard
unpalatable
though
it
might
be
masters
disliked
these
discussions
altogether
but
he
disliked
them
most
of
all
in
presence
of
his
children
he
looked
round
upon
them
in
a
deprecatory
manner
making
a
slight
motion
with
his
hand
and
bringing
his
head
down
on
one
side
and
then
he
gave
a
long
sigh
if
it
was
his
intention
to
convey
some
subtle
warning
to
his
wife
some
caution
that
she
alone
should
understand
he
was
deceived
the
children
all
knew
what
he
meant
quite
as
well
as
did
their
mother
shall
we
go
out
mamma
asked
dolly
finish
your
teas
my
dears
said
masters
who
wished
to
stop
the
discussion
rather
than
to
carry
it
on
before
a
more
select
audience
you
got
to
make
up
your
mind
said
masters
and
you
be
going
over
to
the
bush
at
eight
no
i
need
he
is
to
come
on
monday
i
told
nickem
i
would
see
him
nor
of
course
then
he
go
to
bearside
he
may
go
to
bearside
and
be
oh
lord
i
do
wish
you
let
me
drop
the
business
for
a
few
minutes
when
i
am
in
here
you
do
know
anything
about
it
how
should
you
i
know
that
if
i
did
speak
you
let
everything
slip
through
your
fingers
there
twentyman
kate
open
the
door
kate
who
was
fond
of
twentyman
rushed
up
and
opened
the
front
door
at
once
in
saying
so
much
of
kate
i
do
not
mean
it
to
be
understood
that
any
precocious
ideas
of
love
were
troubling
that
young
lady
bosom
kate
masters
was
a
jolly
bouncing
schoolgirl
of
fifteen
who
was
not
too
proud
to
eat
toffy
and
thought
herself
still
a
child
but
she
was
very
fond
of
lawrence
twentyman
who
had
a
pony
that
she
could
ride
and
who
was
always
to
her
all
the
family
liked
twentyman
unless
it
might
be
mary
who
was
the
one
that
he
specially
liked
himself
and
mary
was
not
altogether
averse
to
him
knowing
him
to
be
manly
and
straightforward
but
twentyman
had
proposed
to
her
and
she
had
certainly
not
accepted
him
this
however
had
broken
none
of
the
family
friendship
every
one
in
the
house
unless
it
might
be
mary
herself
hoped
that
twentyman
might
prevail
at
last
the
man
was
worth
six
or
seven
hundred
a
year
and
had
a
good
house
and
owed
no
one
a
shilling
he
was
handsome
and
about
the
fellow
known
of
course
they
all
desired
that
he
should
prevail
with
mary
i
wish
that
i
were
old
enough
larry
that
all
kate
had
said
to
him
once
laughing
i
would
have
you
if
you
were
ever
so
old
larry
had
replied
you
want
to
be
out
hunting
every
day
that
will
show
the
sort
of
terms
that
larry
was
on
with
his
friend
kate
he
called
at
the
house
every
saturday
with
the
declared
object
of
going
over
to
the
club
that
was
held
that
evening
in
the
parlour
at
the
bush
whither
masters
also
always
went
it
was
understood
at
home
that
masters
should
attend
this
club
every
saturday
from
eight
till
eleven
but
that
he
was
not
at
any
other
time
to
give
way
to
the
fascinations
of
the
bush
on
this
occasion
and
we
may
say
on
almost
every
saturday
night
twentyman
arrived
a
full
hour
before
the
appointed
time
the
reason
of
his
doing
so
was
of
course
well
understood
and
was
quite
approved
by
masters
she
was
not
at
any
rate
as
yet
a
cruel
stepmother
but
still
if
the
girl
could
be
transferred
to
so
eligible
a
home
as
that
which
twentyman
could
give
her
it
would
be
well
for
all
parties
when
he
took
his
seat
he
did
not
address
himself
specially
to
the
lady
of
his
love
i
do
know
how
a
gentleman
is
to
do
so
in
the
presence
of
her
father
and
mother
and
sisters
saturday
after
saturday
he
probably
thought
that
some
occasion
would
arise
but
if
his
words
could
have
been
counted
it
would
have
been
found
that
he
addressed
fewer
to
her
than
to
any
one
in
the
room
larry
said
his
special
friend
kate
am
i
to
have
the
pony
at
the
bridge
meet
how
very
free
you
are
miss
said
her
mother
i
do
know
about
that
said
larry
when
is
there
to
be
a
meet
at
the
bridge
i
have
heard
but
i
have
tony
tuppett
told
me
that
they
would
be
there
this
day
fortnight
tony
tuppett
was
the
huntsman
of
the
u
that
more
than
tony
can
know
he
may
have
guessed
it
shall
i
have
the
pony
if
he
has
guessed
right
then
the
pony
was
promised
and
kate
trusting
in
tony
sagacity
was
happy
have
you
heard
of
all
this
about
dillsborough
wood
asked
masters
the
attorney
shrank
at
the
question
and
shook
himself
uneasily
in
his
chair
yes
i
heard
about
it
said
larry
and
what
do
you
think
about
it
i
do
see
why
lord
rufford
is
to
ride
over
everybody
because
he
a
lord
twentyman
scratched
his
head
though
a
keen
sportsman
himself
he
did
not
specially
like
lord
rufford
a
fact
which
had
been
very
well
known
to
masters
but
nevertheless
this
threatened
action
against
the
nobleman
was
distasteful
to
him
it
was
not
a
hunting
affair
or
twentyman
could
not
have
doubted
for
a
moment
it
was
a
shooting
difficulty
and
as
twentyman
had
never
been
asked
to
fire
a
gun
on
the
rufford
preserves
it
was
no
great
sorrow
to
him
that
there
should
be
such
a
difficulty
but
the
thing
threatened
was
an
attack
upon
the
country
gentry
and
their
amusements
and
twentyman
was
a
country
gentleman
who
followed
sport
upon
the
whole
his
sympathies
were
with
lord
rufford
the
man
is
an
utter
blackguard
you
know
said
larry
last
year
he
threatened
to
shoot
the
foxes
in
dillsborough
wood
no
said
kate
quite
horrified
i
afraid
he
a
bad
sort
of
fellow
all
round
said
the
attorney
i
do
see
why
he
should
claim
what
he
thinks
due
to
him
said
masters
i
told
that
his
lordship
offered
him
an
acre
for
the
whole
of
the
two
fields
said
the
goarly
declares
said
masters
that
the
pheasants
leave
him
four
bushels
of
wheat
to
the
acre
goarly
was
the
man
who
had
proposed
himself
as
a
client
to
masters
and
who
was
desirous
of
claiming
damages
to
the
amount
of
forty
shillings
an
acre
for
injury
done
to
the
crops
on
two
fields
belonging
to
himself
which
lay
adjacent
to
dillsborough
wood
a
covert
belonging
to
lord
rufford
about
four
miles
from
the
town
in
which
both
pheasants
and
foxes
were
preserved
with
great
care
has
goarly
been
to
you
asked
twentyman
masters
nodded
his
head
that
just
it
said
masters
i
do
see
why
a
man
is
to
go
to
law
if
he
pleases
that
is
if
he
can
afford
to
pay
for
it
i
have
nothing
to
say
against
sport
but
i
do
say
that
they
should
run
the
same
chance
as
others
and
i
say
it
a
shame
if
they
to
band
themselves
together
and
make
the
county
too
hot
to
hold
any
one
as
does
like
to
have
his
things
ridden
over
and
his
crops
devoured
and
his
fences
knocked
to
jericho
i
think
there
a
deal
of
selfishness
in
sport
and
a
deal
of
tyranny
oh
mrs
masters
exclaimed
larry
well
i
do
and
if
a
poor
man
or
a
man
whether
he
poor
or
no
added
masters
correcting
herself
as
she
thought
of
the
money
which
this
man
ought
to
have
in
order
that
he
might
pay
for
his
lawsuit
thinks
hisself
injured
it
nonsense
to
tell
me
that
nobody
should
take
up
his
case
it
just
as
though
the
butcher
would
sell
a
man
a
leg
of
mutton
because
lord
rufford
had
a
spite
against
him
who
lord
rufford
everybody
knows
that
i
care
very
little
for
his
lordship
said
twentyman
nor
i
and
i
do
see
why
gregory
should
if
goarly
is
entitled
to
what
he
wants
he
wo
get
it
that
all
but
let
it
be
tried
fairly
hereupon
masters
took
up
his
hat
and
left
the
room
and
twentyman
followed
him
not
having
yet
expressed
any
positive
opinion
on
the
delicate
matter
submitted
to
his
judgment
of
course
goarly
was
a
brute
had
he
not
threatened
to
shoot
foxes
but
then
an
attorney
must
live
by
lawsuits
and
it
seemed
to
twentyman
that
an
attorney
should
not
stop
to
inquire
whether
a
new
client
is
a
brute
or
not
chapter
iv
the
dillsborough
club
the
club
so
called
at
dillsborough
was
held
every
saturday
evening
in
a
back
parlour
at
the
bush
and
was
attended
generally
by
seven
or
eight
members
it
was
a
very
easy
club
there
was
no
balloting
and
no
other
expense
attending
it
other
than
that
of
paying
for
the
liquor
which
each
man
chose
to
drink
sometimes
about
ten
there
was
a
little
supper
the
cost
of
which
was
defrayed
by
subscription
among
those
who
partook
of
it
it
was
one
rule
of
the
club
or
a
habit
rather
which
had
grown
to
be
a
rule
that
runciman
might
introduce
into
it
any
one
he
pleased
i
do
not
know
that
a
similar
privilege
was
denied
to
any
one
else
but
as
runciman
had
a
direct
pecuniary
advantage
in
promoting
the
club
the
were
generally
ushered
in
by
him
when
the
attorney
and
twentyman
entered
the
room
runciman
was
seated
as
usual
in
an
at
the
corner
of
the
fire
nearest
to
the
door
with
the
bell
at
his
right
hand
he
was
a
hale
man
about
fifty
with
black
hair
now
turning
grey
at
the
edges
and
a
chin
he
had
a
pronounced
strong
face
of
his
own
one
capable
of
evincing
anger
and
determination
when
necessary
but
equally
apt
for
smiles
or
on
occasion
for
genuine
laughter
he
was
a
masterful
but
a
pleasant
man
very
civil
to
customers
and
to
his
friends
generally
while
they
took
him
the
right
way
but
one
who
could
be
a
tartar
if
he
were
offended
holding
an
opinion
that
his
position
as
landlord
of
an
inn
was
one
requiring
masterdom
and
his
wife
was
like
him
in
everything
except
in
this
that
she
always
submitted
to
him
he
was
a
temperate
man
in
the
main
but
on
saturday
nights
he
would
become
jovial
and
sometimes
a
little
quarrelsome
when
this
occurred
the
club
would
generally
break
itself
up
and
go
home
to
bed
not
in
the
least
offended
indeed
runciman
was
the
tyrant
of
the
club
though
it
was
held
at
his
house
expressly
with
the
view
of
putting
money
into
his
pocket
opposite
to
his
seat
was
another
not
so
big
as
runciman
but
still
a
soft
and
easy
chair
which
was
always
left
for
the
attorney
for
masters
was
a
man
much
respected
through
all
dillsborough
partly
on
his
own
account
but
more
perhaps
for
the
sake
of
his
father
and
grandfather
he
was
a
man
with
straggling
grey
hair
who
always
wore
black
clothes
and
a
white
cravat
there
was
something
in
his
appearance
which
recommended
him
among
his
neighbours
who
were
disposed
to
say
he
looked
the
gentleman
but
a
stranger
might
have
thought
his
cheeks
to
be
flabby
and
his
mouth
to
be
weak
making
a
circle
or
the
beginning
of
a
circle
round
the
fire
were
nupper
the
doctor
a
sporting
old
bachelor
doctor
who
had
the
reputation
of
riding
after
the
hounds
in
order
that
he
might
be
ready
for
broken
bones
and
minor
accidents
next
to
him
in
another
facing
the
fire
was
ned
botsey
the
younger
of
the
two
brewers
from
norrington
who
was
in
the
habit
during
the
hunting
season
of
stopping
from
saturday
to
monday
at
the
bush
partly
because
the
rufford
hounds
hunted
on
saturday
and
monday
and
on
those
days
seldom
met
in
the
norrington
direction
and
partly
because
he
liked
the
sporting
conversation
of
the
dillsborough
club
he
was
a
little
man
very
neat
in
his
attire
who
liked
to
be
above
his
company
and
fancied
that
he
was
so
in
runciman
parlour
between
him
and
the
attorney
chair
was
harry
stubbings
from
stanton
corner
the
man
who
let
out
hunters
and
whom
twentyman
had
threatened
to
thrash
his
introduction
to
the
club
had
taken
place
lately
not
without
some
opposition
but
runciman
had
set
his
foot
upon
that
saying
that
it
was
all
d
nonsense
he
had
prevailed
and
twentyman
had
consented
to
meet
the
man
but
there
was
no
great
friendship
between
them
seated
back
on
the
sofa
was
ribbs
the
butcher
who
was
allowed
into
the
society
as
being
a
specially
modest
man
his
modesty
perhaps
did
not
hinder
him
in
an
affair
of
sheep
or
bullocks
nor
yet
in
the
collection
of
his
debts
but
at
the
club
he
understood
his
position
and
rarely
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
when
twentyman
followed
the
attorney
into
the
room
there
was
a
vacant
chair
between
botsey
and
harry
stubbings
but
he
would
not
get
into
it
preferring
to
seat
himself
on
the
table
at
botsey
right
hand
so
goarly
was
with
you
masters
runciman
began
as
soon
as
the
attorney
was
seated
it
was
clear
that
they
had
all
been
talking
about
goarly
and
his
and
that
goarly
and
the
would
be
talked
about
very
generally
in
dillsborough
he
was
over
at
my
place
this
evening
said
the
attorney
you
are
not
going
to
take
his
case
up
for
him
mr
masters
said
young
botsey
we
expect
something
better
from
you
than
that
now
ned
botsey
was
rather
an
impudent
young
man
and
masters
though
he
was
mild
enough
at
home
did
not
like
impudence
from
the
world
at
large
i
suppose
botsey
said
he
that
if
goarly
were
to
go
to
you
for
a
barrel
of
beer
you
sell
it
to
him
i
do
know
whether
i
should
or
not
i
dare
say
my
people
would
but
that
a
different
thing
i
do
see
any
difference
at
all
you
not
very
particular
as
to
your
customers
and
i
do
ask
you
any
questions
about
them
ring
the
bell
runciman
please
the
bell
was
rung
and
the
two
ordered
their
liquor
it
was
quite
right
that
ned
botsey
should
be
put
down
every
one
in
the
room
felt
that
but
there
was
something
in
the
attorney
tone
which
made
the
assembled
company
feel
that
he
had
undertaken
case
whereas
in
the
opinion
of
the
company
goarly
was
a
scoundrel
with
whom
masters
should
have
had
nothing
to
do
the
attorney
had
never
been
a
sporting
man
himself
but
he
had
always
been
as
it
were
on
that
side
goarly
is
a
great
fool
for
his
pains
said
the
doctor
he
has
had
a
very
fair
offer
made
him
and
first
or
last
it
cost
him
forty
pounds
he
has
got
it
into
his
head
said
the
landlord
that
he
can
sue
lord
rufford
for
his
fences
lord
rufford
is
not
answerable
for
his
fences
it
the
loss
of
crop
he
going
for
said
twentyman
how
can
there
be
pheasants
to
that
amount
in
dillsborough
wood
continued
the
landlord
when
everybody
knows
that
foxes
breed
there
every
year
there
is
a
surer
find
for
a
fox
in
the
whole
county
everybody
knows
that
lord
rufford
never
lets
his
game
stand
in
the
way
of
foxes
lord
rufford
was
runciman
great
friend
and
patron
and
best
customer
and
not
a
word
against
lord
rufford
was
allowed
in
that
room
though
elsewhere
in
dillsborough
things
were
sometimes
said
of
his
lordship
then
there
came
on
that
dispute
among
sportsmen
whether
foxes
and
pheasants
are
or
are
not
pleasant
companions
to
each
other
every
one
was
agreed
that
if
not
then
the
pheasants
should
suffer
and
that
any
country
gentleman
who
allowed
his
gamekeeper
to
entrench
on
the
privileges
of
foxes
in
order
that
pheasants
might
be
more
abundant
was
a
brute
and
a
beast
and
altogether
unworthy
to
live
in
england
larry
twentyman
and
ned
botsey
expressed
an
opinion
that
pheasants
were
predominant
in
dillsborough
wood
while
runciman
the
doctor
and
harry
stubbings
declared
loudly
that
everything
that
foxes
could
desire
was
done
for
them
in
that
elysium
of
sport
we
drew
the
wood
blank
last
time
we
were
there
said
larry
you
remember
runciman
about
the
end
of
last
march
of
course
i
remember
said
the
landlord
just
the
end
of
the
season
when
two
vixens
had
litters
in
the
wood
you
do
suppose
bean
was
going
to
let
that
old
butcher
tony
find
a
fox
in
dillsborough
at
that
time
bean
was
his
lordship
head
gamekeeper
in
that
part
of
the
country
how
many
foxes
had
we
found
there
during
the
season
two
or
three
suggested
botsey
seven
said
the
energetic
landlord
seven
including
and
killed
four
if
you
kill
four
foxes
out
of
an
wood
and
have
two
litters
at
the
end
of
the
season
i
do
think
you
have
much
to
complain
of
if
they
all
did
as
well
as
lord
rufford
you
have
more
foxes
than
you
know
what
to
do
with
said
the
doctor
then
this
branch
of
the
conversation
was
ended
by
a
bet
of
a
new
hat
between
botsey
and
the
landlord
as
to
the
finding
of
a
fox
in
dillsborough
wood
when
it
should
next
be
drawn
as
to
which
when
the
speculation
was
completed
harry
stubbings
offered
runciman
ten
shillings
down
for
his
side
of
the
bargain
but
all
this
did
not
divert
the
general
attention
from
the
important
matter
of
goarly
attack
let
it
be
how
it
will
said
runciman
a
fellow
like
that
should
be
put
down
he
did
not
address
himself
specially
to
masters
but
that
gentleman
felt
that
he
was
being
talked
at
certainly
he
ought
said
nupper
if
he
did
feel
satisfied
with
what
his
lordship
offered
him
why
could
he
ask
his
lordship
to
refer
the
matter
to
a
couple
of
farmers
who
understood
it
it
the
spirit
of
the
thing
said
ribbs
from
his
place
on
the
sofa
it
a
hodious
spirit
that
just
it
ribbs
said
harry
stubbings
it
all
meant
for
opposition
whether
it
shooting
or
whether
it
hunting
all
one
such
a
chap
ought
to
be
allowed
to
have
land
i
take
it
away
from
him
by
act
of
parliament
it
such
as
him
as
is
destroying
the
country
there
ai
many
of
them
hereabouts
thank
god
said
the
landlord
now
twentyman
said
stubbings
who
was
anxious
to
make
friends
with
the
you
know
what
land
can
do
and
what
land
has
done
as
well
as
any
man
what
would
you
say
was
the
real
damage
done
to
them
two
by
his
lordship
game
last
autumn
you
saw
the
crops
as
they
were
growing
and
you
know
what
came
off
the
land
i
would
like
to
say
but
if
you
were
on
your
oath
twentyman
was
there
more
than
an
acre
lost
no
nor
five
shillings
said
runciman
i
think
goarly
ought
to
take
his
lordship
offer
if
you
mean
that
said
twentyman
then
there
was
a
pause
during
which
more
drink
was
brought
in
and
pipes
were
everybody
wished
that
masters
might
be
got
to
say
that
he
would
not
take
the
case
but
there
was
a
delicacy
about
asking
him
if
i
remember
right
he
was
in
rufford
gaol
once
said
runciman
he
was
let
out
on
bail
and
then
the
matter
was
hushed
up
somehow
said
the
attorney
it
was
something
about
a
woman
continued
runciman
i
know
that
on
that
occasion
he
came
out
an
awful
scoundrel
do
you
remember
asked
botsey
how
he
used
to
walk
up
and
down
the
with
a
gun
two
years
ago
swearing
he
would
shoot
the
fox
if
he
broke
over
his
land
i
heard
him
say
it
botsey
said
twentyman
it
would
have
been
the
first
fox
he
murdered
said
the
doctor
not
by
many
said
the
landlord
you
remember
that
old
woman
near
my
place
said
stubbings
it
was
he
that
put
her
up
to
tell
all
them
lies
about
her
turkeys
i
ran
it
home
to
him
a
blackguard
like
that
nobody
ought
to
take
him
up
i
hope
you
wo
masters
said
the
doctor
the
doctor
was
as
old
as
the
attorney
and
had
known
him
for
many
years
no
one
else
could
dare
to
ask
the
question
i
do
suppose
i
shall
nupper
said
the
attorney
from
his
chair
it
was
the
first
word
he
had
spoken
since
he
had
put
down
young
botsey
it
would
just
suit
me
but
a
man
has
to
judge
of
those
things
for
himself
then
there
was
a
general
rejoicing
and
runciman
stood
broiled
bones
and
ham
and
eggs
and
bottled
stout
for
the
entire
club
one
unfortunate
effect
of
which
unwonted
conviviality
was
that
masters
did
not
get
home
till
near
twelve
that
was
sure
to
cause
discomfort
and
then
he
had
pledged
himself
to
decline
business
chapter
reginald
morton
we
will
now
go
back
to
hoppet
hall
and
its
inhabitants
when
the
old
squire
died
he
left
by
his
will
hoppet
hall
and
certain
other
houses
in
dillsborough
which
was
all
that
he
could
leave
to
his
grandson
reginald
morton
then
there
arose
a
question
whether
this
property
also
was
not
entailed
the
former
masters
and
our
friend
of
the
present
day
had
been
quite
certain
of
the
squire
power
to
do
what
he
liked
with
it
but
others
had
been
equally
certain
on
the
other
side
and
there
had
been
a
lawsuit
during
that
time
reginald
morton
had
been
forced
to
live
on
a
very
small
allowance
his
aunt
lady
ushant
had
done
what
little
she
could
for
him
but
it
had
been
felt
to
be
impossible
that
he
should
remain
at
bragton
which
was
the
property
of
the
cousin
who
was
at
law
with
him
from
the
moment
of
his
birth
the
honourable
morton
who
was
also
his
aunt
by
marriage
had
been
his
bitter
enemy
he
was
the
son
of
an
daughter
and
according
to
her
theory
of
life
should
never
even
have
been
noticed
by
the
real
mortons
and
this
honourable
old
lady
was
almost
equally
adverse
to
lady
ushant
whose
husband
had
simply
been
a
knight
and
who
had
left
nothing
behind
him
thus
reginald
morton
had
been
friendless
since
his
grandfather
died
and
had
lived
in
germany
nobody
quite
knew
how
during
the
entire
period
of
this
hoppet
hall
had
remained
untenanted
when
the
property
was
finally
declared
to
belong
to
reginald
morton
the
hall
before
it
could
be
used
required
considerable
repair
but
there
was
other
property
the
bush
inn
belonged
to
reginald
morton
as
did
the
house
in
which
masters
lived
and
sundry
other
smaller
tenements
in
the
vicinity
there
was
an
income
from
these
of
about
five
hundred
pounds
a
year
reginald
who
was
then
nearly
thirty
years
of
age
came
over
to
england
and
stayed
for
a
month
or
two
at
bragton
with
his
aunt
to
the
infinite
chagrin
of
the
old
dowager
the
management
of
the
town
property
was
entrusted
to
masters
and
hoppet
hall
was
repaired
at
this
period
mainwaring
had
just
come
to
dillsborough
and
having
a
wife
with
some
money
and
perhaps
quite
as
much
pretension
had
found
the
rectory
too
small
and
had
taken
the
hall
on
a
lease
for
seven
years
when
this
was
arranged
reginald
morton
again
went
to
germany
and
did
not
return
till
the
lease
had
run
out
by
that
time
mainwaring
having
spent
a
little
money
found
that
the
rectory
would
be
large
enough
for
his
small
family
then
the
hall
was
again
untenanted
for
awhile
till
quite
suddenly
reginald
morton
returned
to
dillsborough
and
took
up
his
permanent
residence
in
his
own
house
it
soon
became
known
that
the
would
not
add
much
to
the
gaiety
of
the
place
the
only
people
whom
he
knew
in
dillsborough
were
his
own
tenants
runciman
and
masters
and
the
attorney
eldest
daughter
during
those
months
which
he
had
spent
with
lady
ushant
at
bragton
mary
had
been
living
there
then
a
child
of
twelve
years
old
and
as
a
child
had
become
his
fast
friend
with
his
aunt
he
had
continually
corresponded
and
partly
at
her
instigation
and
partly
from
feelings
of
his
own
he
had
at
once
gone
to
the
attorney
house
this
was
now
two
years
since
and
he
had
found
in
his
old
playmate
a
beautiful
young
woman
in
his
opinion
very
unlike
the
people
with
whom
she
lived
for
the
first
twelvemonths
he
saw
her
occasionally
though
not
indeed
very
often
once
or
twice
he
had
drunk
tea
at
the
attorney
house
on
which
occasions
the
upstairs
had
been
almost
as
grand
as
it
was
uncomfortable
then
the
attentions
of
larry
twentyman
began
to
make
themselves
visible
infinitely
to
reginald
morton
disgust
up
to
that
time
he
had
no
idea
of
falling
in
love
with
the
girl
himself
since
he
had
begun
to
think
on
such
subjects
at
all
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
not
marry
he
was
almost
the
more
proud
of
his
birth
by
his
father
side
because
he
had
been
made
to
hear
so
much
of
his
mother
low
position
he
had
told
himself
a
hundred
times
that
under
no
circumstances
could
he
marry
any
other
than
a
lady
of
good
birth
but
his
own
fortune
was
small
and
he
knew
himself
well
enough
to
be
sure
that
he
would
not
marry
for
money
he
was
now
nearly
forty
years
of
age
and
had
never
yet
been
thrown
into
the
society
of
any
one
that
had
attracted
him
he
was
sure
that
he
would
not
marry
and
yet
when
he
saw
that
twentyman
was
made
much
of
and
flattered
by
the
whole
masters
family
apparently
because
he
was
regarded
as
an
eligible
husband
for
mary
reginald
morton
was
not
only
disgusted
but
personally
offended
being
a
most
unreasonable
man
he
conceived
a
bitter
dislike
to
poor
larry
who
at
any
rate
was
truly
in
love
and
was
not
looking
too
high
in
desiring
to
marry
the
portionless
daughter
of
the
attorney
but
morton
thought
that
the
man
ought
to
be
kicked
and
horsewhipped
or
at
any
rate
banished
into
some
speechless
exile
for
his
presumption
with
runciman
he
had
dealings
and
in
some
sort
friendship
there
were
two
meadows
attached
to
hoppet
hall
fields
lying
close
to
the
town
which
were
very
suitable
for
the
landlord
purposes
mainwaring
had
held
them
in
his
own
hands
taking
them
up
from
runciman
who
had
occupied
them
while
the
house
was
untenanted
in
a
manner
which
induced
runciman
to
feel
that
it
was
useless
to
go
to
church
to
hear
such
sermons
as
those
preached
by
the
rector
but
morton
had
restored
the
fields
giving
them
rent
free
on
condition
that
he
should
be
supplied
with
milk
and
butter
runciman
no
doubt
had
the
best
of
the
bargain
as
he
generally
had
in
all
bargains
but
he
was
a
man
who
liked
to
be
generous
when
generously
treated
consequently
he
almost
overdid
his
neighbour
with
butter
and
cream
and
occasionally
sent
in
quarters
of
lamb
and
sweetbreads
to
make
up
the
weight
i
do
know
that
the
offerings
were
particularly
valued
but
friendship
was
engendered
runciman
too
had
his
grounds
for
quarrelling
with
those
who
had
taken
up
the
management
of
the
bragton
property
after
the
squire
death
and
had
his
own
antipathy
to
the
honourable
morton
and
her
grandson
the
secretary
of
legation
when
the
was
going
on
he
had
been
altogether
on
reginald
morton
side
it
was
an
affair
of
sides
and
quite
natural
that
runciman
and
the
attorney
should
be
friendly
with
the
at
hoppet
hall
though
there
were
very
few
points
of
personal
sympathy
between
them
reginald
morton
was
no
sportsman
nor
was
he
at
all
likely
to
become
a
member
of
the
dillsborough
club
it
was
currently
reported
of
him
in
the
town
that
he
had
never
sat
on
a
horse
or
fired
off
a
gun
as
he
had
been
brought
up
as
a
boy
by
the
old
squire
this
was
probably
an
exaggeration
but
it
is
certain
that
at
this
period
of
his
life
he
had
given
up
any
aptitudes
in
that
direction
for
which
his
early
training
might
have
suited
him
he
had
brought
back
with
him
to
hoppet
hall
many
cases
of
books
which
the
ignorance
of
dillsborough
had
magnified
into
an
enormous
library
and
he
was
certainly
a
sedentary
reading
man
there
was
already
a
report
in
the
town
that
he
was
engaged
in
some
stupendous
literary
work
and
the
men
and
women
generally
looked
upon
him
as
a
disagreeable
marvel
of
learning
dillsborough
of
itself
was
not
bookish
and
would
have
regarded
any
one
known
to
have
written
an
article
in
a
magazine
almost
as
a
phenomenon
he
seldom
went
to
church
much
to
the
sorrow
of
surtees
who
ventured
to
call
at
the
house
and
remonstrate
with
him
he
never
called
again
and
though
it
was
the
habit
of
surtees
life
to
speak
as
little
ill
as
possible
of
any
one
he
was
not
able
to
say
any
good
of
morton
mainwaring
who
would
never
have
troubled
himself
though
his
parishioner
had
not
entered
a
place
of
worship
once
in
a
twelvemonth
did
say
many
severe
things
against
his
former
landlord
he
hated
people
who
were
unsocial
and
averse
to
dining
out
and
who
departed
from
the
ways
of
living
common
among
english
country
gentlemen
mainwaring
was
upon
the
whole
prepared
to
take
the
other
side
reginald
morton
though
he
was
now
nearly
forty
was
a
handsome
man
with
fair
hair
cut
short
and
a
light
beard
which
was
always
clipped
though
his
mother
had
been
an
innkeeper
daughter
in
montreal
he
had
the
morton
blue
eyes
and
the
handsome
morton
nose
he
was
nearly
six
feet
high
and
strongly
made
and
was
known
to
be
a
much
finer
man
than
the
secretary
of
legation
who
was
rather
small
and
supposed
to
be
not
very
robust
our
lonely
man
was
a
great
walker
and
had
investigated
every
lane
and
pathway
and
almost
every
hedge
within
ten
miles
of
dillsborough
before
he
had
resided
there
two
years
but
his
favourite
rambles
were
all
in
the
neighbourhood
of
bragton
as
there
was
no
one
living
in
the
house
no
one
but
the
old
housekeeper
who
had
lived
there
always
he
was
able
to
wander
about
the
place
as
he
pleased
on
the
tuesday
afternoon
after
the
meeting
of
the
dillsborough
club
which
has
been
recorded
he
was
seated
about
three
on
the
rail
of
the
over
the
dill
with
a
long
german
pipe
hanging
from
his
mouth
he
was
noted
throughout
the
whole
country
for
this
pipe
or
for
others
like
it
such
a
one
usually
being
in
his
mouth
as
he
wandered
about
the
amount
of
tobacco
which
he
had
smoked
since
his
return
to
these
parts
exactly
in
that
spot
was
considerable
for
there
he
might
have
been
found
at
some
period
of
the
afternoon
at
least
three
times
a
week
he
would
sit
on
this
rail
for
half
an
hour
looking
down
at
the
sluggish
waters
of
the
little
river
rolling
the
smoke
out
of
his
mouth
at
long
intervals
and
thinking
perhaps
of
the
great
book
which
he
was
supposed
to
be
writing
as
he
sat
there
now
he
suddenly
heard
voices
and
laughter
and
presently
three
girls
came
round
the
corner
of
the
hedge
which
at
this
spot
hid
the
dillsborough
path
and
he
saw
the
attorney
three
daughters
it
morton
said
dolly
in
a
whisper
he
always
walking
about
bragton
said
kate
in
another
whisper
tony
tuppett
says
that
he
the
bragton
ghost
kate
said
mary
also
in
a
low
voice
you
should
talk
so
much
about
what
you
hear
from
tony
tuppett
bosh
said
kate
who
knew
that
she
could
not
be
scolded
in
the
presence
of
morton
he
came
forward
and
shook
hands
with
them
all
and
took
off
his
hat
to
mary
you
walked
a
long
way
miss
masters
he
said
we
do
think
it
far
i
like
sometimes
to
come
and
look
at
the
old
place
and
so
do
i
wonder
whether
you
remember
how
often
i
sat
you
on
this
rail
and
threatened
to
throw
you
into
the
river
i
remember
very
well
that
you
did
threaten
me
once
and
that
i
almost
believed
that
you
would
throw
me
in
what
had
she
done
that
was
naughty
mr
morton
asked
kate
i
do
think
she
ever
did
anything
naughty
in
those
days
i
know
whether
she
has
changed
for
the
worse
since
mary
is
never
naughty
now
said
dolly
kate
and
i
are
naughty
and
it
very
much
better
fun
than
being
good
the
world
has
found
out
that
long
ago
miss
dolly
only
the
world
is
not
quite
so
candid
in
owning
it
as
you
are
will
you
come
and
walk
round
the
house
miss
masters
i
never
go
in
but
i
have
no
scruples
about
the
paths
and
park
at
the
end
of
the
bridge
leading
into
the
shrubbery
there
was
a
stile
high
indeed
but
made
commodiously
with
steps
almost
like
a
double
staircase
so
that
ladies
could
pass
it
without
trouble
mary
had
given
her
assent
to
the
proposed
walk
and
was
in
the
act
of
putting
out
her
hand
to
be
helped
over
the
stile
when
twentyman
appeared
at
the
other
side
of
it
if
here
is
larry
said
kate
morton
face
turned
as
black
as
thunder
but
he
immediately
went
back
across
the
bridge
leading
mary
with
him
the
other
girls
who
had
followed
him
on
to
the
bridge
had
of
course
to
go
back
also
mary
was
made
very
unhappy
by
the
meeting
morton
would
of
course
think
that
it
had
been
planned
whereas
by
mary
herself
it
had
been
altogether
unexpected
kate
when
the
bridge
was
free
rushed
over
it
and
whispered
something
to
larry
the
meeting
had
indeed
been
planned
between
her
and
dolly
and
the
lover
and
this
special
walk
had
been
taken
at
the
request
of
the
two
younger
girls
morton
stood
stock
still
as
though
he
expected
that
twentyman
would
pass
by
larry
hurried
over
the
bridge
feeling
sure
that
the
meeting
with
morton
had
been
accidental
and
thinking
that
he
would
pass
on
towards
the
house
larry
was
not
at
all
ashamed
of
his
purpose
nor
was
he
inclined
to
give
way
and
pass
on
he
came
up
boldly
to
his
love
and
shook
hands
with
her
with
a
pleasant
smile
if
you
are
walking
back
to
dillsborough
he
said
maybe
you
let
me
go
a
little
way
with
you
i
was
going
round
the
house
with
morton
she
said
timidly
perhaps
i
can
join
you
said
he
bobbing
his
head
at
the
other
man
if
you
intended
to
walk
back
with
twentyman
began
morton
but
i
did
said
the
poor
girl
who
in
truth
understood
more
of
it
all
than
did
either
of
the
two
men
i
did
expect
him
and
i
did
expect
you
it
a
pity
i
ca
go
both
ways
is
it
she
added
attempting
to
appear
cheerful
come
back
mary
said
kate
we
had
walking
enough
and
shall
be
awfully
tired
before
we
get
home
mary
had
thought
that
she
would
like
extremely
to
go
round
the
house
with
her
old
friend
and
have
a
hundred
incidents
of
her
early
life
called
to
her
memory
the
meeting
with
reginald
morton
had
been
altogether
pleasant
to
her
she
had
often
felt
how
much
she
would
have
liked
it
had
the
chance
of
her
life
enabled
her
to
see
more
frequently
one
whom
as
a
child
she
had
so
intimately
known
but
at
the
moment
she
lacked
the
courage
to
walk
boldly
across
the
bridge
and
thus
to
rid
herself
of
lawrence
twentyman
she
had
already
perceived
that
morton
manner
had
rendered
it
impossible
that
her
lover
should
follow
them
i
am
afraid
i
must
go
home
she
said
it
was
the
very
thing
she
did
not
want
to
do
this
going
home
with
lawrence
twentyman
and
yet
she
herself
said
that
she
must
do
it
driven
to
say
so
by
a
nervous
dread
of
showing
herself
to
be
fond
of
the
other
man
company
good
afternoon
to
you
said
morton
very
gloomily
waving
his
hat
and
stalking
across
the
bridge
chapter
vi
not
in
love
reginald
morton
as
he
walked
across
the
bridge
towards
the
house
was
thoroughly
disgusted
with
all
the
world
he
was
very
angry
with
himself
feeling
that
he
had
altogether
made
a
fool
of
himself
by
his
manner
he
had
shown
himself
to
be
offended
not
only
by
twentyman
but
by
miss
masters
also
and
he
was
well
aware
as
he
thought
of
it
all
that
neither
of
them
had
given
him
any
cause
of
offence
if
she
chose
to
make
an
appointment
for
a
walk
with
lawrence
twentyman
and
to
keep
it
what
was
that
to
him
his
anger
was
altogether
irrational
and
he
knew
that
it
was
so
what
right
had
he
to
have
an
opinion
about
it
if
mary
masters
should
choose
to
like
the
society
of
twentyman
it
was
an
affair
between
her
and
her
father
and
mother
in
which
he
could
have
no
interest
and
yet
he
had
not
only
taken
offence
but
was
well
aware
that
he
had
shown
his
feeling
nevertheless
as
to
the
girl
herself
he
could
not
argue
himself
out
of
his
anger
it
was
grievous
to
him
that
he
should
have
gone
out
of
his
way
to
ask
her
to
walk
with
him
just
at
the
moment
when
she
was
expecting
this
vulgar
lover
for
that
she
had
expected
him
he
felt
no
doubt
yet
he
had
heard
her
disclaim
any
intention
of
walking
with
the
man
but
girls
are
sly
especially
when
their
lovers
are
concerned
it
made
him
sore
at
heart
to
feel
that
this
girl
should
be
sly
and
doubly
sore
to
think
that
she
should
have
been
able
to
love
such
a
one
as
lawrence
twentyman
as
he
roamed
about
among
the
grounds
this
idea
troubled
him
much
he
assured
himself
that
he
was
not
in
love
with
her
himself
and
that
he
had
no
idea
of
falling
in
love
with
her
but
it
sickened
him
to
think
that
a
girl
who
had
been
brought
up
by
his
aunt
who
had
been
loved
at
bragton
whom
he
had
liked
who
looked
so
like
a
lady
should
put
herself
on
a
par
with
such
a
wretch
as
that
in
all
this
he
was
most
unjust
to
both
of
them
he
was
specially
unjust
to
poor
larry
who
was
by
no
means
a
wretch
his
costume
was
not
that
to
which
morton
had
been
accustomed
in
germany
nor
would
it
have
passed
without
notice
in
bond
street
but
it
was
rational
and
clean
when
he
came
to
the
bridge
to
meet
his
sweetheart
he
had
on
a
shooting
coat
a
billicock
hat
brown
breeches
and
gaiters
nearly
up
to
his
knees
i
do
know
that
a
young
man
in
the
country
could
wear
more
suitable
attire
and
he
was
a
man
just
such
a
one
as
in
this
dress
would
take
the
eye
of
a
country
girl
there
was
a
little
bit
of
dash
about
him
just
a
touch
of
swagger
which
better
breeding
might
have
prevented
but
it
was
not
enough
to
make
him
odious
to
an
unprejudiced
observer
i
could
fancy
that
an
old
lady
from
london
with
an
eye
in
her
head
for
manly
symmetry
would
have
liked
to
look
at
larry
and
would
have
thought
that
a
girl
in
position
would
be
happy
in
having
such
a
lover
providing
that
his
character
was
good
and
his
means
adequate
but
reginald
morton
was
not
an
old
woman
and
to
his
eyes
the
smart
young
farmer
with
his
billicock
hat
not
quite
straight
on
his
head
was
an
odious
thing
to
behold
he
exaggerated
the
swagger
and
took
no
notice
whatever
of
the
limbs
and
then
this
man
had
proposed
to
accompany
him
had
wanted
to
join
his
party
had
thought
it
possible
that
a
flirtation
might
be
carried
on
in
his
presence
he
sincerely
hated
the
man
but
what
was
he
to
think
of
such
a
girl
as
mary
masters
when
she
could
bring
herself
to
like
the
attentions
of
such
a
lover
he
was
very
cross
with
himself
because
he
knew
how
unreasonable
was
his
anger
of
one
thing
only
could
he
assure
himself
that
he
would
never
again
willingly
put
himself
in
mary
company
what
was
dillsborough
and
the
ways
of
its
inhabitants
to
him
why
should
he
so
far
leave
the
old
fashions
of
his
life
as
to
fret
himself
about
an
attorney
daughter
in
a
little
english
town
and
yet
he
did
fret
himself
walking
rapidly
and
smoking
his
pipe
a
great
deal
quicker
than
was
his
custom
when
he
was
about
to
return
home
he
passed
the
front
of
the
house
and
there
standing
at
the
open
door
he
saw
hopkins
the
housekeeper
who
had
in
truth
been
waiting
for
him
he
said
a
word
to
her
intending
to
make
his
way
on
without
stopping
but
she
called
him
back
have
you
heard
the
news
mr
reginald
she
said
i
have
heard
any
news
this
twelvemonth
he
replied
laws
that
is
so
like
you
reginald
the
young
squire
is
to
be
here
next
week
who
is
the
young
squire
i
did
know
there
was
any
squire
now
mr
reginald
a
squire
as
i
take
it
hopkins
is
a
country
gentleman
who
lives
on
his
own
property
since
my
grandfather
time
no
such
gentleman
has
lived
at
bragton
that
true
too
reginald
any
way
morton
is
coming
down
next
week
i
thought
he
was
in
america
he
has
come
home
for
a
turn
like
and
is
staying
up
in
town
with
the
old
lady
the
old
lady
always
meant
the
honourable
morton
and
is
the
old
lady
coming
down
with
him
i
fancy
she
is
reginald
he
did
say
as
much
but
only
that
there
would
be
three
or
four
a
couple
of
ladies
he
said
and
perhaps
more
so
i
am
getting
the
east
bedroom
with
the
and
the
blue
room
for
her
ladyship
people
about
bragton
had
been
accustomed
to
call
morton
her
ladyship
that
where
she
always
used
to
be
would
you
come
in
and
see
mr
reginald
certainly
not
hopkins
if
you
were
asking
me
into
a
house
of
your
own
i
would
go
in
and
see
all
the
rooms
and
chat
with
you
for
an
hour
but
i
do
suppose
i
shall
ever
go
into
this
house
again
unless
things
change
very
much
indeed
then
i
sure
i
hope
they
will
change
mr
reginald
hopkins
had
known
reginald
morton
as
a
boy
growing
up
into
manhood
had
almost
been
present
at
his
birth
and
had
renewed
her
friendship
while
he
was
staying
with
lady
ushant
but
of
the
present
squire
as
she
called
him
she
had
seen
almost
nothing
and
what
she
had
once
remembered
of
him
had
now
been
obliterated
by
an
absence
of
twenty
years
of
course
she
was
on
reginald
side
in
the
family
quarrel
although
she
was
the
paid
servant
of
the
foreign
office
paragon
and
they
are
to
be
here
next
week
what
day
next
week
mrs
hopkins
hopkins
did
know
on
what
day
she
was
to
expect
the
visitors
nor
how
long
they
intended
to
stay
john
morton
had
said
in
his
letter
that
he
would
send
his
own
man
down
two
days
before
his
arrival
and
that
was
nearly
all
that
he
had
said
then
morton
started
on
his
return
walk
to
dillsborough
again
taking
the
path
across
the
bridge
ah
he
said
to
himself
with
a
shudder
as
he
crossed
the
stile
thinking
of
his
own
softened
feelings
as
he
had
held
out
his
hand
to
help
mary
masters
and
then
of
his
revulsion
of
feeling
when
she
declared
her
purpose
of
walking
home
with
twentyman
and
he
struck
the
rail
of
the
bridge
with
his
stick
as
though
he
were
angry
with
the
place
altogether
and
he
thought
to
himself
that
he
would
never
come
there
any
more
that
he
hated
the
place
and
that
he
would
never
cross
that
bridge
again
then
his
mind
reverted
to
the
tidings
he
had
heard
from
hopkins
what
ought
he
to
do
when
his
cousin
arrived
though
there
had
been
a
long
lawsuit
there
had
been
no
actual
declared
quarrel
between
him
and
the
heir
he
had
indeed
never
seen
the
heir
for
the
last
twenty
years
nor
had
they
ever
interchanged
letters
there
had
been
no
communication
whatever
between
them
and
therefore
there
could
hardly
be
a
quarrel
he
disliked
his
cousin
nay
almost
hated
him
he
was
quite
aware
of
that
and
he
was
sure
also
that
he
hated
that
honourable
old
woman
worse
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
and
that
he
always
would
do
so
he
knew
that
the
honourable
old
woman
had
attempted
to
drive
his
own
mother
from
bragton
and
of
course
he
hated
her
but
that
was
no
reason
why
he
should
not
call
on
his
cousin
he
was
anxious
to
do
what
was
right
he
was
specially
anxious
that
blame
should
not
be
attributed
to
him
what
he
would
like
best
would
be
that
he
might
call
might
find
nobody
at
home
and
that
then
john
morton
should
not
return
the
courtesy
he
did
not
want
to
go
to
bragton
as
a
guest
he
did
not
wish
to
be
in
the
wrong
himself
but
he
was
by
no
means
equally
anxious
that
his
cousin
should
keep
himself
free
from
reproach
the
bridge
path
came
out
on
the
dillsborough
road
just
two
miles
from
the
town
and
morton
as
he
got
over
the
last
stile
saw
lawrence
twentyman
coming
towards
him
on
the
road
the
man
no
doubt
had
gone
all
the
way
into
dillsborough
with
the
girls
and
was
now
returning
home
the
parish
of
bragton
lies
to
the
left
of
the
high
road
as
you
go
into
the
town
from
rufford
and
the
direction
of
london
whereas
chowton
farm
the
property
of
twentyman
is
on
the
right
of
the
road
but
in
the
large
parish
of
john
dillsborough
dillsborough
wood
lies
at
the
back
of
larry
twentyman
land
and
joining
on
to
larry
land
and
also
to
the
wood
is
the
patch
of
ground
owned
by
that
scoundrel
goarly
chowton
farm
gate
opens
on
to
the
high
road
so
that
larry
was
now
on
his
direct
way
home
as
soon
as
he
saw
morton
he
made
up
his
mind
to
speak
to
him
he
was
quite
sure
from
what
had
passed
between
him
and
the
girls
on
the
road
home
that
he
had
done
something
wrong
he
was
convinced
that
he
had
interfered
in
some
way
though
he
did
not
at
all
know
how
of
reginald
morton
he
was
not
in
the
least
jealous
he
too
was
of
a
jealous
temperament
but
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
to
join
reginald
morton
and
mary
masters
together
he
was
very
much
in
love
with
mary
but
had
no
idea
that
she
was
in
any
way
above
the
position
which
she
might
naturally
hold
as
daughter
of
the
dillsborough
attorney
but
of
reginald
morton
attributes
and
scholarship
and
general
standing
he
had
a
mystified
appreciation
which
saved
him
from
the
pain
of
thinking
that
such
a
man
could
be
in
love
with
his
sweetheart
as
he
certainly
did
not
wish
to
quarrel
with
morton
having
always
taken
reginald
side
in
the
family
disputes
he
thought
that
he
would
say
a
civil
word
in
passing
and
if
possible
apologise
when
morton
came
up
he
raised
his
hand
to
his
head
and
did
open
his
mouth
though
not
pronouncing
any
word
very
clearly
morton
looked
at
him
as
grim
as
death
just
raised
his
hand
and
then
passed
on
with
a
quick
step
larry
was
displeased
but
the
other
was
so
thoroughly
a
gentleman
one
of
the
mortons
and
a
man
of
property
in
the
county
that
he
did
even
yet
wish
to
quarrel
with
him
what
the
deuce
have
i
done
said
he
to
himself
as
he
walked
on
i
tell
her
not
to
go
up
to
the
house
if
i
offered
to
walk
with
her
what
was
that
to
him
it
must
be
remembered
that
lawrence
twentyman
was
twelve
years
younger
than
reginald
morton
and
that
a
man
of
is
apt
to
regard
a
man
of
forty
as
very
much
too
old
for
falling
in
love
it
is
a
mistake
which
it
will
take
him
fully
ten
years
to
rectify
and
then
he
will
make
a
similar
mistake
as
to
men
of
fifty
with
his
awe
for
morton
combined
learning
and
age
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
be
jealous
morton
passed
on
rapidly
almost
feeling
that
he
had
been
a
brute
but
what
business
had
the
objectionable
man
to
address
him
he
tried
to
excuse
himself
but
yet
he
felt
that
he
had
been
a
brute
and
had
so
demeaned
himself
in
reference
to
the
daughter
of
the
dillsborough
attorney
he
would
teach
himself
to
do
all
he
could
to
promote
the
marriage
he
would
give
sage
advice
to
mary
masters
as
to
the
wisdom
of
establishing
herself
having
not
an
hour
since
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
never
see
her
again
he
would
congratulate
the
attorney
and
masters
he
would
conquer
the
absurd
feeling
which
at
present
was
making
him
wretched
he
would
cultivate
some
sort
of
acquaintance
with
the
man
and
make
the
happy
pair
a
wedding
present
but
yet
what
a
beast
the
man
was
with
that
billicock
hat
on
one
side
of
his
head
and
those
tight
leather
gaiters
as
he
passed
through
the
town
towards
his
own
house
he
saw
runciman
standing
in
front
of
the
hotel
his
road
took
him
up
hobbs
gate
by
the
corner
of
the
bush
but
runciman
came
a
little
out
of
the
way
to
meet
him
you
have
heard
the
news
said
the
innkeeper
i
have
heard
one
piece
of
news
what
that
sir
come
you
tell
me
yours
first
the
young
squire
is
coming
down
to
bragton
next
week
that
my
news
too
it
is
not
likely
that
there
should
be
two
matters
of
interest
in
dillsborough
on
the
same
day
i
do
know
why
dillsborough
should
be
worse
off
than
any
other
place
morton
but
at
any
rate
the
squire
coming
so
hopkins
told
me
has
he
written
to
you
his
coachman
or
his
groom
has
or
perhaps
he
keeps
what
they
call
an
ekkery
he
much
too
big
a
swell
to
write
to
the
likes
of
me
lord
bless
me
when
i
think
of
it
i
wonder
how
many
dozen
of
orders
had
from
lord
rufford
under
his
own
hand
runciman
dinner
at
eight
ten
of
us
wo
wait
a
moment
yours
i
suppose
morton
would
think
that
his
lordship
had
let
himself
down
by
anything
of
that
sort
what
does
my
cousin
want
two
pair
of
horses
for
a
week
certain
and
perhaps
longer
and
two
carriages
how
am
i
to
let
anyone
have
two
pair
of
horses
for
a
week
certain
and
perhaps
longer
what
are
other
customers
to
do
i
can
supply
a
gentleman
by
the
month
and
buy
horses
to
suit
or
i
can
supply
him
by
the
job
but
i
guess
morton
do
well
know
how
things
are
managed
in
this
country
he
have
to
learn
what
day
does
he
come
they
have
told
me
that
yet
mr
morton
chapter
vii
the
walk
home
mary
masters
when
reginald
morton
had
turned
his
back
upon
her
at
the
bridge
was
angry
with
herself
and
with
him
which
was
reasonable
and
very
angry
also
with
larry
twentyman
which
was
unreasonable
as
she
had
at
once
acceded
to
morton
proposal
that
they
should
walk
round
the
house
together
surely
he
should
not
have
deserted
her
so
soon
it
had
not
been
her
fault
that
the
other
man
had
come
up
she
had
not
wanted
him
but
she
was
aware
that
when
the
option
had
in
some
sort
been
left
to
herself
she
had
elected
to
walk
back
with
larry
she
knew
her
own
motives
and
her
own
feelings
but
neither
of
the
men
would
understand
them
because
she
preferred
the
company
of
morton
and
had
at
the
moment
feared
that
her
sisters
would
have
deserted
her
had
she
followed
him
therefore
she
had
declared
her
purpose
of
going
back
to
dillsborough
in
doing
which
she
knew
that
larry
and
the
girls
would
accompany
her
but
of
course
morton
would
think
that
she
had
preferred
the
company
of
her
recognised
admirer
it
was
pretty
well
known
in
dillsborough
that
larry
was
her
lover
her
stepmother
had
spoken
of
it
very
freely
and
larry
himself
was
a
man
who
did
not
keep
his
lights
hidden
under
a
bushel
i
hope
i
not
been
in
the
way
mary
said
twentyman
as
soon
as
morton
was
out
of
hearing
in
the
way
of
what
i
did
think
there
was
any
harm
in
offering
to
go
up
to
the
house
with
you
if
you
were
going
who
has
said
there
was
any
harm
the
path
was
only
broad
enough
for
one
and
she
was
walking
first
larry
was
following
her
and
the
girls
were
behind
him
i
think
that
morton
is
a
very
fellow
said
kate
who
was
the
last
hold
your
tongue
kate
said
mary
you
do
know
what
you
are
talking
about
i
know
as
well
as
any
one
when
a
person
is
what
made
him
go
off
in
that
fashion
nobody
had
said
anything
to
him
he
always
looks
as
though
he
were
going
to
eat
somebody
said
dolly
he
sha
eat
me
said
kate
then
there
was
a
pause
during
which
they
all
went
along
quickly
mary
leading
the
way
larry
felt
that
he
was
wasting
his
opportunity
and
yet
hardly
knew
how
to
use
it
feeling
that
the
girl
was
angry
with
him
i
wish
you
say
mary
whether
you
think
that
i
did
anything
wrong
nothing
wrong
to
me
mr
twentyman
did
i
do
anything
wrong
to
him
i
do
know
how
far
you
may
be
acquainted
with
him
he
was
proposing
to
go
somewhere
and
you
offered
to
go
with
him
i
offered
to
go
with
you
said
larry
sturdily
i
suppose
sufficiently
acquainted
with
you
quite
so
said
mary
why
should
he
be
so
proud
i
never
said
an
uncivil
word
to
him
he
nothing
to
me
if
he
can
do
without
me
i
sure
that
i
can
do
without
him
very
well
indeed
i
should
think
the
truth
is
mary
there
has
been
quite
enough
said
about
it
mr
twentyman
the
truth
is
mary
i
came
on
purpose
to
have
a
word
with
you
hearing
this
kate
rushed
on
and
pulled
larry
by
the
tail
of
his
coat
how
did
you
know
i
was
to
be
there
demanded
mary
sharply
i
did
know
i
had
reason
to
think
you
perhaps
might
be
there
the
girls
i
knew
had
been
asking
you
to
come
as
far
as
the
bridge
at
any
rate
i
took
my
chance
i
seen
him
some
time
before
and
then
i
saw
you
if
i
to
be
watched
about
in
that
way
said
mary
angrily
i
go
out
at
all
of
course
i
want
to
see
you
why
should
i
i
all
fair
and
above
board
ai
i
your
father
and
mother
know
all
about
it
it
as
though
i
were
doing
anything
clandestine
he
paused
for
a
reply
but
mary
walked
on
in
silence
she
knew
quite
well
that
he
was
warranted
in
seeking
her
and
that
nothing
but
a
very
positive
decision
on
her
part
could
put
an
end
to
his
courtship
at
the
present
moment
she
was
inclined
to
be
very
positive
but
he
had
hardly
as
yet
given
her
an
opportunity
of
speaking
out
i
think
you
know
mary
what
it
is
that
i
want
they
were
now
at
a
rough
stile
which
enabled
him
to
come
close
up
to
her
and
help
her
she
tripped
over
the
stile
with
a
light
step
and
again
walked
on
rapidly
the
field
they
were
in
enabled
him
to
get
up
to
her
side
and
now
if
ever
was
his
opportunity
it
was
a
long
straggling
meadow
which
he
knew
well
with
the
dill
running
by
it
all
the
way
or
rather
two
meadows
with
an
open
space
where
there
had
once
been
a
gate
he
had
ridden
through
the
gap
a
score
of
times
and
knew
that
at
the
further
side
of
the
second
meadow
they
would
come
upon
the
high
road
the
fields
were
certainly
much
better
for
his
purpose
than
the
road
do
you
think
mary
you
could
say
a
kind
word
to
me
i
never
said
anything
unkind
you
ca
think
ill
of
me
for
loving
you
better
than
all
the
world
i
do
think
ill
of
you
at
all
i
think
very
well
of
you
that
kind
so
i
do
how
can
i
help
thinking
well
of
you
when
i
never
heard
anything
but
good
of
you
then
why
should
you
say
at
once
that
you
have
me
and
make
me
the
happiest
man
in
all
the
county
because
well
i
told
you
before
twentyman
and
that
ought
to
have
been
enough
a
young
woman
does
fall
in
love
with
every
man
that
she
thinks
well
of
i
should
like
you
as
well
as
all
the
rest
of
the
family
if
you
would
only
marry
some
other
girl
i
shall
never
do
that
yes
you
will
some
day
never
i
set
my
heart
upon
it
and
i
mean
to
stick
to
it
i
not
the
fellow
to
turn
about
from
one
girl
to
another
what
i
want
is
the
girl
i
love
i
money
enough
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
of
my
own
i
sure
you
disinterested
mr
twentyman
yes
i
am
ever
since
you
been
home
from
bragton
it
has
been
the
same
thing
and
when
i
felt
that
it
was
so
i
spoke
up
to
your
father
honestly
i
have
been
beating
about
the
bush
and
i
have
done
anything
that
was
honourable
they
were
very
near
the
last
stile
now
come
mary
if
you
wo
make
me
a
promise
say
that
think
of
it
i
have
thought
of
it
twentyman
and
i
ca
make
you
any
other
answer
i
dare
say
i
very
foolish
i
wish
you
were
more
foolish
perhaps
then
you
would
be
so
hard
to
please
whether
i
wise
or
foolish
indeed
indeed
it
no
good
your
going
on
now
we
on
the
road
pray
go
back
home
mr
twentyman
it
be
getting
dark
in
a
little
time
not
before
we
in
dillsborough
if
it
were
ever
so
dark
we
could
find
our
way
home
by
ourselves
come
along
dolly
over
the
last
stile
he
had
stayed
a
moment
to
help
the
younger
girl
and
as
he
did
so
kate
whispered
a
word
in
his
ear
she
angry
because
she
could
go
up
to
the
house
with
that
fellow
it
was
a
foolish
word
but
then
kate
masters
had
not
had
much
experience
in
the
world
whether
overcome
by
mary
resolute
mode
of
speaking
or
aware
that
the
high
road
would
not
suit
his
purpose
he
did
turn
back
as
soon
as
he
had
seen
them
a
little
way
on
their
return
towards
the
town
he
had
not
gone
half
a
mile
before
he
met
morton
and
had
been
to
make
some
apology
to
him
but
morton
had
denied
him
the
opportunity
and
he
had
walked
on
to
his
own
house
low
in
spirits
indeed
but
still
with
none
of
that
sorest
of
agony
which
comes
to
a
lover
from
the
feeling
that
his
love
loves
some
one
else
mary
had
been
very
decided
with
him
more
so
he
feared
than
before
but
still
he
saw
no
reason
why
he
should
not
succeed
at
last
masters
had
told
him
that
mary
would
certainly
give
a
little
trouble
in
winning
but
would
be
the
more
worth
the
winner
trouble
when
won
and
she
had
certainly
shown
no
preference
for
any
other
young
man
about
the
town
there
had
been
a
moment
when
he
had
much
dreaded
surtees
young
clergymen
are
apt
to
be
formidable
rivals
and
surtees
had
certainly
made
some
overtures
of
friendship
to
mary
masters
but
larry
had
thought
that
he
had
seen
that
these
overtures
had
not
led
to
much
and
then
that
fear
had
gone
from
him
he
did
believe
that
mary
was
now
angry
because
she
had
not
been
allowed
to
walk
about
bragton
with
her
old
friend
morton
it
had
been
natural
that
she
should
like
to
do
so
it
was
the
pride
of
life
that
she
had
been
befriended
by
the
mortons
and
lady
ushant
but
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
he
ought
to
be
jealous
of
morton
though
it
had
occurred
to
kate
masters
there
was
very
little
said
between
the
sisters
on
their
way
back
to
the
town
mary
was
pretty
sure
now
that
the
two
girls
had
made
the
appointment
with
larry
but
she
was
unwilling
to
question
them
on
the
subject
immediately
on
their
arrival
at
home
they
heard
the
great
news
john
morton
was
coming
to
bragton
with
a
party
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
hopkins
had
spoken
of
four
persons
masters
told
mary
that
there
were
to
be
a
dozen
at
least
and
that
four
or
five
pairs
of
horses
and
half
a
dozen
carriages
had
been
ordered
from
runciman
he
means
to
cut
a
dash
when
he
does
begin
said
masters
is
he
going
to
stay
mother
he
would
come
down
in
that
way
if
it
was
only
for
a
few
days
i
suppose
but
what
they
will
do
for
furniture
i
do
know
there
plenty
of
furniture
mother
a
thousand
years
old
or
for
wine
or
fruit
or
plate
the
old
plate
was
there
when
lady
ushant
left
people
do
things
now
in
a
very
different
way
from
what
they
used
a
couple
of
dozen
silver
forks
made
quite
a
show
on
the
old
table
now
they
change
the
things
so
often
that
ten
dozen
is
nothing
i
do
suppose
there
a
bottle
of
wine
in
the
cellar
they
can
get
wine
from
cobbold
mother
cobbold
wine
wo
go
down
with
them
i
fancy
i
wonder
what
servants
they
bringing
when
masters
came
in
from
his
office
the
news
was
corroborated
john
morton
was
certainly
coming
to
bragton
the
attorney
had
still
a
small
unsettled
and
disputed
claim
against
the
owner
of
the
property
and
he
had
now
received
by
the
day
mail
an
answer
to
a
letter
which
he
had
written
to
morton
saying
that
that
gentleman
would
see
him
in
the
course
of
the
next
fortnight
chapter
viii
the
paragon
party
at
bragton
there
was
certainly
a
great
deal
of
fuss
made
about
john
return
to
the
home
of
his
ancestors
made
altogether
by
himself
and
those
about
him
and
not
by
those
who
were
to
receive
him
on
the
thursday
in
the
week
following
that
of
which
we
have
been
speaking
two
carriages
from
the
bush
met
the
party
at
the
railway
station
and
took
them
to
bragton
runciman
after
due
consideration
put
up
with
the
inconsiderate
nature
of
the
order
given
and
supplied
the
coaches
and
horses
as
required
consoling
himself
no
doubt
with
the
reflection
that
he
could
charge
for
the
unreasonableness
of
the
demand
in
the
bill
the
coachman
and
butler
had
come
down
two
days
before
their
master
so
that
things
might
be
in
order
hopkins
learned
from
the
butler
that
though
the
party
would
at
first
consist
only
of
three
two
other
very
august
persons
were
to
follow
on
the
saturday
no
less
than
lady
augustus
trefoil
and
her
daughter
arabella
and
hopkins
was
soon
led
to
imagine
though
no
positive
information
was
given
to
her
on
the
subject
that
miss
trefoil
was
engaged
to
be
married
to
their
master
will
he
live
here
altogether
mr
tankard
hopkins
asked
to
this
question
tankard
was
able
to
give
a
very
definite
answer
he
was
quite
sure
that
morton
would
not
live
anywhere
altogether
according
to
tankard
ideas
the
whole
foreign
policy
of
england
depended
on
john
morton
presence
in
some
capital
either
in
europe
asia
or
america
upon
morton
presence
and
of
course
upon
his
own
also
tankard
thought
it
not
improbable
that
they
might
soon
be
wanted
at
hong
kong
or
some
very
distant
place
but
in
the
meantime
they
were
bound
to
be
back
at
washington
very
shortly
tankard
had
himself
been
at
washington
and
also
before
that
at
lisbon
and
could
tell
hopkins
how
utterly
unimportant
had
been
the
actual
ministers
at
those
places
and
how
the
welfare
of
england
had
depended
altogether
on
the
discretion
and
general
omniscience
of
his
young
master
and
of
himself
he
tankard
had
been
the
only
person
in
washington
who
had
really
known
in
what
order
americans
should
go
out
to
dinner
one
after
another
elias
gotobed
who
was
coming
was
perhaps
the
most
distinguished
american
of
the
day
and
was
senator
for
mickewa
mickey
war
said
poor
hopkins
that
been
one
of
them
terrible
american
wars
we
used
to
hear
of
then
tankard
explained
to
her
that
mickewa
was
one
of
the
western
states
and
elias
gotobed
was
a
great
republican
who
had
very
advanced
opinions
of
his
own
respecting
government
liberty
and
public
institutions
in
general
with
morton
and
the
senator
was
coming
the
honourable
morton
the
lady
had
her
lady
maid
and
morton
had
his
own
man
so
that
there
would
be
a
great
influx
of
persons
of
course
there
was
very
much
perturbation
of
spirit
hopkins
after
that
first
letter
the
contents
of
which
she
had
communicated
to
reginald
morton
had
received
various
despatches
and
been
asked
various
questions
could
she
find
a
cook
could
she
find
two
housemaids
and
all
these
were
only
wanted
for
a
time
in
her
distress
she
went
to
runciman
and
did
get
assistance
i
suppose
he
thinks
he
to
have
the
cook
out
of
my
kitchen
runciman
had
said
somebody
however
was
found
who
said
she
could
cook
and
two
girls
who
professed
that
they
knew
how
to
make
beds
and
in
this
way
an
establishment
was
ready
before
the
arrival
of
the
secretary
of
legation
and
the
great
american
senator
those
other
questions
of
wine
and
plate
and
vegetables
had
no
doubt
settled
themselves
after
some
fashion
john
morton
had
come
over
to
england
on
leave
of
absence
for
four
months
and
had
brought
with
him
the
senator
from
mickewa
the
senator
had
never
been
in
england
before
and
was
especially
anxious
to
study
the
british
constitution
and
to
see
the
ways
of
britons
with
his
own
eyes
he
had
only
been
a
fortnight
in
london
before
this
journey
down
to
the
county
had
been
planned
gotobed
wished
to
see
english
country
life
and
thought
that
he
could
not
on
his
first
arrival
have
a
better
opportunity
it
must
be
explained
also
that
there
was
another
motive
for
this
english
rural
sojourn
lady
augustus
trefoil
who
was
an
adventurous
lady
had
been
travelling
in
the
united
states
with
her
daughter
and
had
there
fallen
in
with
john
morton
arabella
trefoil
was
a
beauty
and
a
woman
of
fashion
and
had
captivated
the
paragon
an
engagement
had
been
made
subject
to
various
stipulations
the
consent
of
lord
augustus
in
the
first
place
as
to
which
john
morton
who
only
understood
foreign
affairs
was
not
aware
as
he
would
have
been
had
he
lived
in
england
that
lord
augustus
was
nobody
lady
augustus
had
spoken
freely
as
to
settlements
value
of
property
life
insurance
and
such
matters
and
had
spoken
firmly
as
well
as
freely
expressing
doubt
as
to
the
expediency
of
such
an
engagement
all
of
which
had
surprised
morton
considerably
for
the
young
lady
had
at
first
been
left
in
his
hands
with
almost
american
freedom
and
now
lady
augustus
and
her
daughter
were
coming
down
on
a
visit
of
inspection
they
had
been
told
as
had
the
senator
that
things
would
be
in
the
rough
the
house
had
not
been
properly
inhabited
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
century
the
senator
had
expressed
himself
quite
contented
lady
augustus
had
only
hoped
that
everything
would
be
made
as
comfortable
as
possible
for
her
daughter
i
do
know
what
more
could
have
been
done
at
so
short
a
notice
than
to
order
two
carriages
two
housemaids
and
a
cook
a
word
or
two
must
also
be
said
of
the
old
lady
who
made
one
of
the
party
the
honourable
morton
was
now
seventy
but
no
old
lady
ever
showed
less
signs
of
advanced
age
it
is
not
to
be
understood
from
this
that
she
was
beautiful
but
that
she
was
very
strong
what
might
be
the
colour
of
her
hair
or
whether
she
had
any
no
man
had
known
for
many
years
but
she
wore
so
perfect
a
front
that
some
people
were
absolutely
deluded
she
was
very
much
wrinkled
but
as
there
are
wrinkles
which
seem
to
come
from
the
decay
of
those
muscles
which
should
uphold
the
skin
so
are
there
others
which
seem
to
denote
that
the
owner
has
simply
got
rid
of
the
watery
weaknesses
of
juvenility
morton
wrinkles
were
strong
wrinkles
she
was
thin
but
always
carried
herself
bolt
upright
and
would
never
even
lean
back
in
her
chair
she
had
a
great
idea
of
her
duty
and
hated
everybody
who
differed
from
her
with
her
whole
heart
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
viscount
a
fact
which
she
never
forgot
for
a
single
moment
and
which
she
thought
gave
her
positive
superiority
to
all
women
who
were
not
the
daughters
of
dukes
or
marquises
or
of
earls
therefore
as
she
did
not
live
much
in
the
fashionable
world
she
rarely
met
any
one
above
herself
her
own
fortune
on
her
marriage
had
been
small
but
now
she
was
a
rich
woman
her
husband
had
been
dead
nearly
half
a
century
and
during
the
whole
of
that
time
she
had
been
saving
money
to
two
charities
she
gave
annually
per
annum
each
duty
demanded
it
and
the
money
was
given
beyond
that
she
had
never
been
known
to
spend
a
penny
in
charity
duty
she
had
said
more
than
once
required
of
her
that
she
do
something
to
repair
the
ravages
made
on
the
morton
property
by
the
preposterous
extravagance
of
the
old
squire
in
regard
to
the
younger
son
and
that
son
child
in
her
anger
she
had
not
hesitated
on
different
occasions
to
call
the
present
reginald
a
bastard
though
the
expression
was
a
wicked
calumny
for
which
there
was
no
excuse
without
any
aid
of
hers
the
morton
property
had
repaired
itself
there
had
been
a
minority
of
thirteen
or
fourteen
years
and
since
that
time
the
present
owner
had
not
spent
his
income
but
john
morton
was
not
himself
averse
to
money
and
had
always
been
careful
to
maintain
good
relations
with
his
grandmother
she
had
now
been
asked
down
to
bragton
in
order
that
she
might
approve
if
possible
of
the
proposed
wife
it
was
not
likely
that
she
should
approve
absolutely
of
anything
but
to
have
married
without
an
appeal
to
her
would
have
been
to
have
sent
the
money
flying
into
the
hands
of
some
of
her
poor
paternal
cousins
arabella
trefoil
was
the
granddaughter
of
a
duke
and
a
step
had
so
far
been
made
in
the
right
direction
but
morton
knew
that
lord
augustus
was
nobody
that
there
would
be
no
money
and
that
lady
augustus
had
been
the
daughter
of
a
banker
and
that
her
fortune
had
been
nearly
squandered
the
paragon
was
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
his
american
visitor
nor
as
far
as
the
comforts
of
his
house
were
concerned
of
his
grandmother
of
the
beauty
and
her
mother
he
did
stand
in
awe
but
he
had
two
days
in
which
to
look
to
things
before
they
would
come
the
train
reached
the
dillsborough
station
at
three
and
the
two
carriages
were
there
to
meet
them
you
will
understand
gotobed
said
the
old
lady
that
my
grandson
has
nothing
of
his
own
established
here
as
yet
this
little
excuse
was
produced
by
certain
patches
and
tears
in
the
cushions
and
linings
of
the
carriages
gotobed
smiled
and
bowed
and
declared
that
everything
was
fixed
convenient
then
the
senator
followed
the
old
lady
into
one
carriage
morton
followed
alone
into
the
other
and
they
were
driven
away
to
bragton
when
hopkins
had
taken
the
old
lady
up
to
her
room
morton
asked
the
senator
to
walk
round
the
grounds
gotobed
lighting
an
enormous
cigar
of
which
he
put
half
down
his
throat
for
more
commodious
and
quick
consumption
walked
on
to
the
middle
of
the
drive
and
turning
back
looked
up
at
the
house
quite
a
pile
he
said
observing
that
the
offices
and
outhouses
extended
a
long
way
to
the
left
till
they
almost
joined
other
buildings
in
which
were
the
stables
and
it
a
house
said
the
owner
nothing
very
particular
as
houses
are
built
damp
i
should
say
i
think
not
i
have
never
lived
here
much
myself
but
i
have
not
heard
that
it
is
considered
so
i
guess
it
damp
very
lonely
is
it
we
like
to
have
our
society
inside
among
ourselves
in
the
country
keep
a
sort
of
hotel
like
suggested
gotobed
well
i
dislike
hotel
life
especially
when
there
are
no
charges
how
many
servants
do
you
want
to
keep
up
such
a
house
as
that
morton
explained
that
at
present
he
knew
very
little
about
it
himself
then
led
him
away
by
the
path
over
the
bridge
and
turning
to
the
left
showed
him
the
building
which
had
once
been
the
kennels
of
the
rufford
hounds
all
that
for
dogs
exclaimed
gotobed
all
for
dogs
said
morton
hounds
we
generally
call
them
hounds
are
they
well
i
remember
though
seems
to
me
more
civil
how
many
used
there
to
be
about
fifty
couple
i
think
a
hundred
dogs
no
wonder
your
country
gentlemen
burst
up
so
often
would
do
as
well
except
for
the
show
of
the
thing
hounds
could
hunt
a
fox
mr
gotobed
i
guess
would
do
just
as
well
only
for
the
show
what
strikes
me
morton
on
visiting
this
old
country
is
that
so
much
is
done
for
show
what
do
you
say
to
new
york
mr
gotobed
there
certainly
are
a
couple
of
hundred
fools
in
new
york
who
having
more
money
than
brains
amuse
themselves
by
imitating
european
follies
but
you
wo
find
that
through
the
country
morton
you
wo
find
a
hundred
dogs
at
an
american
planter
house
when
ten
or
twelve
would
do
as
well
hunting
is
not
one
of
your
amusements
yes
it
is
i
been
a
hunter
myself
i
had
nothing
to
eat
but
what
i
killed
for
a
month
together
that
more
than
any
of
your
hunters
can
say
a
hundred
dogs
to
kill
one
fox
not
all
at
the
same
time
mr
gotobed
and
you
have
got
none
now
i
do
hunt
myself
and
does
nobody
hunt
the
foxes
about
here
at
present
then
morton
explained
that
on
the
saturday
following
the
hounds
under
the
mastership
of
that
celebrated
sportsman
captain
glomax
would
meet
at
eleven
exactly
at
the
spot
on
which
they
were
then
standing
and
that
if
gotobed
would
walk
out
after
breakfast
he
should
see
the
whole
paraphernalia
including
about
half
a
hundred
dogs
and
perhaps
a
couple
of
hundred
men
on
horseback
i
shall
be
delighted
to
see
any
institution
of
this
great
country
said
gotobed
however
much
opposed
it
may
be
to
my
opinion
either
of
utility
or
rational
recreation
then
having
nearly
eaten
up
one
cigar
he
lit
another
preparatory
to
eating
it
and
sauntered
back
to
the
house
before
dinner
that
evening
there
were
a
few
words
between
the
paragon
and
his
grandmother
i
afraid
you
wo
like
my
american
friend
he
said
he
is
all
very
well
john
of
course
an
american
member
of
congress
ca
be
an
english
gentleman
you
in
your
position
have
to
be
civil
to
such
people
i
dare
say
i
shall
get
on
very
well
with
mr
gotobed
i
must
get
somebody
to
meet
him
lady
augustus
and
her
daughter
are
coming
they
knew
each
other
in
washington
and
there
will
be
so
many
ladies
you
could
ask
the
coopers
from
mallingham
suggested
the
lady
i
do
think
they
would
dine
out
he
getting
very
old
and
i
told
the
mainwarings
at
dillsborough
are
very
nice
people
said
morton
who
knew
that
mainwaring
at
any
rate
came
from
a
good
family
i
suppose
they
ought
to
call
first
i
never
saw
them
in
my
life
reginald
morton
you
know
is
living
at
hoppet
hall
in
dillsborough
you
do
mean
to
say
you
wish
to
ask
him
to
this
house
i
think
i
ought
why
should
i
take
upon
myself
to
quarrel
with
a
man
i
have
not
seen
since
i
was
a
child
and
who
certainly
is
my
cousin
i
do
not
know
that
he
is
your
cousin
nor
do
you
john
morton
passed
by
the
calumny
which
he
had
heard
before
and
which
he
knew
that
it
was
no
good
for
him
to
attempt
to
subvert
he
was
received
here
as
one
of
the
family
i
know
he
was
and
with
what
result
i
do
think
that
i
ought
to
turn
my
back
upon
him
because
my
left
property
away
from
me
to
him
it
would
give
me
a
bad
name
in
the
county
it
would
be
against
me
when
i
settle
down
to
live
here
i
think
quarrelling
is
the
most
foolish
thing
a
man
can
do
especially
with
his
own
relations
i
can
only
say
this
john
let
me
know
if
he
is
coming
so
that
i
may
not
be
called
upon
to
meet
him
i
will
not
eat
at
table
with
reginald
morton
so
saying
the
old
lady
in
a
stately
fashion
stalked
out
of
the
room
chapter
ix
the
old
kennels
on
the
next
morning
morton
asked
her
grandson
what
he
meant
to
do
with
reference
to
his
suggested
invitation
to
reginald
as
you
will
not
meet
him
of
course
i
have
given
up
the
idea
he
said
the
of
course
had
been
far
from
true
he
had
debated
the
matter
very
much
with
himself
he
was
an
obstinate
man
with
something
of
independence
in
his
spirit
he
liked
money
but
he
liked
having
his
own
way
too
the
old
lady
looked
as
though
she
might
live
to
be
a
hundred
and
though
she
might
last
only
for
ten
years
longer
was
it
worth
his
while
to
be
a
slave
for
that
time
and
he
was
by
no
means
sure
of
her
money
though
he
should
be
a
slave
he
almost
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
ask
reginald
morton
but
then
the
old
lady
would
be
in
her
tantrums
and
there
would
be
the
disagreeable
necessity
of
making
an
explanation
to
that
inquisitive
gentleman
elias
gotobed
i
could
have
met
him
john
i
could
indeed
i
remember
so
well
all
that
occurred
when
your
poor
infatuated
old
would
have
that
woman
into
the
house
i
was
forced
to
have
my
meals
in
my
bedroom
and
to
get
myself
taken
away
as
soon
as
i
could
get
a
carriage
and
horses
after
all
that
i
ought
not
to
be
asked
to
meet
the
child
i
was
thinking
of
asking
old
cooper
on
monday
i
know
she
does
go
out
and
perhaps
mainwaring
would
take
it
amiss
puttock
i
know
is
at
home
but
if
he
were
he
come
puttock
was
the
rector
of
bragton
a
very
rich
living
but
was
unfortunately
afflicted
with
asthma
poor
man
i
heard
of
that
and
he
only
been
here
about
six
years
i
do
see
why
mainwaring
should
take
it
amiss
at
all
you
can
explain
that
you
are
only
here
a
few
days
i
like
to
meet
clergymen
i
think
that
it
is
the
duty
of
a
country
gentleman
to
ask
them
to
his
house
it
shows
a
proper
regard
for
religion
john
i
hope
that
you
see
that
they
have
a
fire
in
the
church
on
sunday
the
honourable
morton
always
went
to
church
and
had
no
doubt
of
her
own
sincerity
when
she
reiterated
her
prayer
that
as
she
forgave
others
their
trespasses
so
might
she
be
forgiven
hers
as
reginald
morton
had
certainly
never
trespassed
against
her
perhaps
there
was
no
reason
why
her
thoughts
should
be
carried
to
the
necessity
of
forgiving
him
the
paragon
wrote
two
very
diplomatic
notes
explaining
his
temporary
residence
and
expressing
his
great
desire
to
become
acquainted
with
his
neighbours
neither
of
the
two
clergymen
were
offended
and
both
of
them
promised
to
eat
his
dinner
on
monday
mainwaring
was
very
fond
of
dining
out
and
would
have
gone
almost
to
any
house
cooper
had
been
enough
in
the
neighbourhood
to
have
known
the
old
squire
and
wrote
an
affectionate
note
expressing
his
gratification
at
the
prospect
of
renewing
his
acquaintance
with
the
little
boy
whom
he
remembered
so
the
party
was
made
up
for
monday
john
morton
was
very
nervous
on
the
matter
fearing
that
lady
augustus
would
think
the
land
to
be
barren
the
friday
passed
by
without
much
difficulty
the
senator
was
driven
about
and
everything
was
inquired
into
one
or
two
were
visited
and
the
farmers
wives
were
much
disturbed
by
the
questions
asked
them
i
do
think
they
get
a
living
in
the
states
was
the
senator
remark
after
leaving
one
of
the
homesteads
in
which
neither
the
farmer
nor
his
wife
had
shown
much
power
of
conversation
then
they
right
to
stay
where
they
are
replied
morton
who
in
spite
of
his
diplomacy
could
not
save
himself
from
being
nettled
they
seem
to
get
a
very
good
living
here
and
they
pay
their
rent
punctually
on
the
saturday
morning
the
hounds
met
at
the
old
kennels
as
the
meet
was
always
called
and
here
was
an
excellent
opportunity
of
showing
to
gotobed
one
of
the
great
institutions
of
the
country
it
was
close
to
the
house
and
therefore
could
be
reached
without
any
trouble
and
as
it
was
held
on
morton
own
ground
he
could
do
more
towards
making
his
visitor
understand
the
thing
than
might
have
been
possible
elsewhere
when
the
hounds
moved
the
carriage
would
be
ready
to
take
them
about
the
roads
and
show
them
as
much
as
could
be
seen
on
wheels
punctually
at
eleven
john
morton
and
his
american
guest
were
on
the
bridge
and
tony
tuppett
was
already
occupying
his
wonted
place
seated
on
a
strong
grey
mare
that
had
done
a
great
deal
of
work
but
would
live
as
tony
used
to
say
to
do
a
great
deal
more
round
him
the
hounds
were
clustered
couple
in
all
some
seated
on
their
haunches
some
standing
obediently
still
while
a
few
moved
about
restlessly
subject
to
the
voices
and
on
one
or
two
occasions
to
a
gentle
administration
of
thong
from
the
attendant
whips
four
or
five
horsemen
were
clustering
round
most
of
them
farmers
and
were
talking
to
tony
our
friend
twentyman
was
the
only
man
in
a
red
coat
who
had
yet
arrived
and
with
him
on
her
brown
pony
was
kate
masters
who
was
listening
with
all
her
ears
to
every
word
that
tony
said
that
i
guess
is
the
captain
you
spoke
of
said
the
senator
pointing
to
tony
tuppett
oh
no
that
the
huntsman
those
three
men
in
caps
are
the
servants
who
do
the
work
the
dogs
ca
be
brought
out
without
servants
to
mind
them
what
you
call
gamekeepers
morton
was
explaining
that
the
men
were
not
gamekeepers
when
captain
glomax
himself
arrived
driving
a
tandem
there
was
no
road
up
to
the
spot
but
on
hunt
mornings
or
at
any
rate
when
the
meet
was
at
the
old
kennels
the
were
open
so
that
vehicles
could
come
up
on
the
green
sward
that
captain
glomax
i
suppose
said
morton
i
do
know
him
but
from
the
way
he
talking
to
the
huntsman
you
may
be
sure
of
it
he
is
the
great
man
is
he
all
these
dogs
belong
to
him
either
to
him
or
the
hunt
and
he
pays
for
those
servants
certainly
he
is
a
very
rich
man
i
suppose
then
morton
endeavoured
to
explain
the
position
of
captain
glomax
he
was
not
rich
he
was
no
one
in
particular
except
that
he
was
captain
glomax
and
his
one
attribute
was
a
knowledge
of
hunting
he
did
keep
the
dogs
out
of
his
own
pocket
he
received
a
year
from
the
gentlemen
of
the
county
and
he
himself
only
paid
anything
which
the
hounds
and
horses
might
cost
over
that
he
a
sort
of
upper
servant
then
asked
the
senator
not
at
all
he
the
greatest
man
in
the
county
on
hunting
days
does
he
live
out
of
it
i
should
think
not
it
a
deal
of
trouble
is
it
full
work
for
an
active
man
time
i
should
say
a
great
many
more
questions
were
asked
and
answered
at
the
end
of
which
the
senator
declared
that
he
did
not
quite
understand
it
but
that
as
far
as
he
saw
he
did
not
think
very
much
of
captain
glomax
if
he
could
make
a
living
out
of
it
i
should
respect
him
said
the
senator
though
it
like
or
handling
arsenic
an
unwholesome
sort
of
profession
i
think
they
look
very
nice
said
morton
as
one
or
two
young
men
rode
up
to
the
place
they
seem
to
me
to
have
thought
more
about
their
breeches
than
anything
else
said
the
senator
but
if
they
going
to
hunt
why
do
they
hunt
have
they
got
a
fox
with
them
then
there
was
a
further
explanation
at
this
moment
there
was
a
murmur
as
of
a
great
coming
arrival
and
then
an
open
carriage
with
four
was
brought
at
a
quick
trot
into
the
open
space
there
were
four
men
dressed
for
hunting
inside
and
two
others
on
the
box
they
were
all
smoking
and
all
talking
it
was
easy
to
see
that
they
did
not
consider
themselves
the
least
among
those
who
were
gathered
together
on
this
occasion
the
carriage
was
immediately
surrounded
by
grooms
and
horses
and
the
ceremony
of
disencumbering
themselves
of
great
coats
and
aprons
of
putting
on
spurs
and
fastening
was
commenced
then
there
were
whispered
communications
from
the
grooms
and
long
faces
under
some
of
the
hats
this
horse
had
been
fit
since
last
monday
run
and
that
man
hack
was
as
it
should
be
a
muttered
curse
might
have
been
heard
from
one
gentleman
as
he
was
told
on
jumping
from
the
box
that
harry
stubbings
had
sent
him
any
second
horse
to
ride
i
did
hear
nothing
about
it
till
yesterday
captain
said
harry
stubbings
and
every
foot
i
had
fit
to
come
out
was
bespoke
the
groom
however
who
heard
this
was
quite
aware
that
stubbings
did
not
wish
to
give
unlimited
credit
to
the
captain
and
he
knew
also
that
the
second
horse
was
to
have
carried
his
master
the
whole
day
as
the
animal
which
was
brought
to
the
meet
had
been
ridden
hard
on
the
previous
wednesday
at
all
this
the
senator
looked
with
curious
eyes
thinking
that
he
had
never
in
his
life
seen
brought
together
a
set
of
more
useless
human
beings
that
is
lord
rufford
said
morton
pointing
to
a
stout
handsome
man
of
about
thirty
who
was
the
owner
of
the
carriage
oh
a
lord
do
the
lords
hunt
generally
that
as
they
like
it
senators
with
us
would
have
time
for
that
said
the
senator
but
you
are
paid
to
do
your
work
everybody
from
whom
work
is
expected
should
be
paid
then
the
work
will
be
done
or
those
who
pay
will
know
the
reason
why
i
must
speak
to
lord
rufford
said
morton
if
you
come
with
me
i
introduce
you
the
senator
followed
willingly
enough
and
the
introduction
was
made
while
his
lordship
was
still
standing
by
his
horse
the
two
men
had
known
each
other
in
london
and
it
was
natural
that
morton
as
owner
of
the
ground
should
come
out
and
speak
to
the
only
man
who
knew
him
it
soon
was
spread
about
that
the
gentleman
talking
to
lord
rufford
was
john
morton
and
many
who
lived
in
the
county
came
up
to
shake
hands
with
him
to
some
of
these
the
senator
was
introduced
and
the
conversation
for
a
few
minutes
seemed
to
interrupt
the
business
on
hand
i
am
sorry
you
should
be
on
foot
gotobed
said
the
lord
and
i
am
sorry
that
i
can
not
mount
him
said
morton
we
can
soon
get
over
that
difficulty
if
he
will
allow
me
to
offer
him
a
horse
the
senator
looked
as
though
he
would
almost
like
it
but
he
quite
like
it
perhaps
your
horse
might
kick
me
off
my
lord
i
ca
answer
for
that
but
he
is
given
to
kicking
and
there
he
is
if
you
get
on
him
but
the
senator
felt
that
the
exhibition
would
suit
neither
his
age
nor
position
and
refused
we
better
be
moving
said
captain
glomax
i
suppose
lord
rufford
we
might
as
well
trot
over
to
dillsborough
wood
at
once
i
saw
bean
as
i
came
along
and
he
seemed
to
wish
we
should
draw
the
wood
first
then
there
was
a
little
whispering
between
his
lordship
and
the
master
and
tony
tuppett
his
lordship
thought
that
as
morton
was
there
the
hounds
might
as
well
be
run
through
the
bragton
spinnies
tony
made
a
wry
face
and
shook
his
head
he
knew
that
though
the
old
kennels
might
be
a
very
good
place
for
meeting
there
was
no
chance
of
finding
a
fox
at
bragton
and
captain
glomax
who
being
an
itinerary
master
had
no
respect
whatever
for
a
country
gentleman
who
did
preserve
also
made
a
long
face
and
also
shook
his
head
but
lord
rufford
who
knew
the
wisdom
of
reconciling
a
newcomer
in
the
county
to
foxhunting
prevailed
and
the
hounds
and
men
were
taken
round
a
part
of
bragton
park
what
t
old
squire
said
if
he
known
there
had
been
a
fox
at
bragton
for
more
nor
ten
year
this
remark
was
made
by
tuppett
to
runciman
who
was
riding
by
him
runciman
replied
that
there
was
a
great
difference
in
people
you
may
say
that
runciman
it
all
changes
his
lordship
father
could
bear
the
sight
of
a
hound
nor
a
horse
and
saddle
well
i
suppose
i
gammon
any
furder
we
just
trot
across
to
the
wood
at
once
they
have
begun
yet
as
far
as
i
can
see
said
gotobed
standing
up
in
the
carriage
they
have
found
as
yet
replied
morton
they
must
go
on
till
they
find
a
fox
they
never
bring
him
with
them
then
there
was
an
explanation
as
to
bagged
foxes
morton
not
being
very
conversant
with
the
subject
he
had
to
explain
and
if
they
should
find
one
all
day
then
it
be
a
blank
and
these
hundred
gentlemen
will
go
home
quite
satisfied
with
themselves
no
they
go
home
quite
dissatisfied
and
have
paid
their
money
and
given
their
time
for
nothing
do
you
know
it
does
seem
to
me
the
most
thing
in
the
world
do
they
ride
faster
than
that
at
this
moment
tony
with
the
hounds
at
his
heels
was
trotting
across
the
park
at
a
usual
pace
from
covert
to
covert
the
senator
was
certainly
ungracious
nothing
that
he
saw
produced
from
him
a
single
word
expressive
of
satisfaction
less
than
a
mile
brought
them
to
the
gate
and
road
leading
up
to
chowton
farm
they
passed
close
by
larry
twentyman
door
and
not
a
few
though
it
was
not
yet
more
than
eleven
stopped
to
have
a
glass
of
larry
beer
when
the
hounds
were
in
the
neighbourhood
larry
beer
was
always
ready
but
tony
and
his
attendants
trotted
by
with
eyes
averted
as
though
no
thought
of
beer
was
in
their
minds
nothing
had
been
done
and
a
huntsman
is
not
entitled
to
beer
till
he
has
found
a
fox
captain
glomax
followed
with
lord
rufford
and
a
host
of
others
there
was
plenty
of
way
here
for
carriages
and
half
a
dozen
vehicles
passed
through
farmyard
immediately
behind
the
house
was
a
meadow
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
meadow
a
stubble
field
next
to
which
was
the
ditch
and
bank
which
formed
the
bounds
of
dillsborough
wood
just
at
this
side
of
the
gate
leading
into
the
there
was
already
a
concourse
of
people
when
tony
arrived
near
it
with
the
hounds
and
immediately
there
was
a
holloaing
and
loud
screeching
of
directions
which
was
soon
understood
to
mean
that
the
hounds
were
at
once
to
be
taken
away
the
captain
rode
on
rapidly
and
then
sharply
gave
his
orders
tony
was
to
take
the
hounds
back
to
twentyman
farmyard
as
fast
as
he
could
and
shut
them
up
in
a
barn
the
whips
were
put
into
violent
commotion
tony
was
eagerly
at
work
not
a
hound
was
to
be
allowed
near
the
gate
and
then
as
the
crowd
of
horsemen
and
carriages
came
on
the
word
poison
was
passed
among
them
from
mouth
to
mouth
what
does
all
this
mean
said
the
senator
i
do
at
all
know
i
afraid
there
something
wrong
replied
morton
i
heard
that
man
say
they
have
taken
the
dogs
back
again
then
the
senator
and
morton
got
out
of
the
carriage
and
made
their
way
into
the
crowd
the
riders
who
had
grooms
on
second
horses
were
soon
on
foot
and
a
circle
was
made
inside
which
there
was
some
object
of
intense
interest
in
the
meantime
the
hounds
had
been
secured
in
one
of
twentyman
barns
what
was
that
object
of
interest
shall
be
told
in
the
next
chapter
chapter
goarly
revenge
the
senator
and
morton
followed
close
on
the
steps
of
lord
rufford
and
captain
glomax
and
were
thus
able
to
make
their
way
into
the
centre
of
the
crowd
there
on
a
clean
sward
of
grass
laid
out
as
carefully
as
though
he
were
a
royal
child
prepared
for
burial
was
a
dead
fox
it
my
lord
it
to
a
moral
said
bean
who
as
keeper
of
the
wood
was
bound
to
vindicate
himself
and
his
master
and
the
wood
feel
of
him
how
stiff
he
is
a
good
many
did
feel
but
lord
rufford
stood
still
and
looked
at
the
poor
victim
in
silence
it
easy
knowing
how
he
come
by
it
said
bean
the
men
around
gazed
into
each
other
faces
with
a
sad
tragic
air
as
though
the
occasion
were
one
which
at
the
first
blush
was
too
melancholy
for
many
words
there
was
whispering
here
and
there
and
one
young
farmer
son
gave
a
deep
sigh
like
a
beginning
to
work
and
rubbed
his
eyes
with
the
back
of
his
hand
there
ai
nothin
too
bad
nothin
said
another
leaving
his
audience
to
imagine
whether
he
were
alluding
to
the
wretchedness
of
the
world
in
general
or
to
the
punishment
which
was
due
to
the
perpetrator
of
this
nefarious
act
the
dreadful
word
vulpecide
was
heard
from
various
lips
with
an
oath
or
two
before
it
it
makes
me
sick
of
my
own
land
to
think
it
should
be
done
so
near
said
larry
twentyman
who
had
just
come
up
runciman
declared
that
they
must
set
their
wits
to
work
not
only
to
find
the
criminal
but
to
prove
the
crime
against
him
and
offered
to
subscribe
a
couple
of
sovereigns
on
the
spot
to
a
common
fund
to
be
raised
for
the
purpose
i
do
know
what
is
to
be
done
with
a
country
like
this
said
captain
glomax
who
as
an
itinerant
was
not
averse
to
cast
a
slur
upon
the
land
of
his
present
sojourn
i
do
remember
anything
like
it
on
my
property
before
said
the
lord
standing
up
for
his
own
estate
and
the
county
at
large
nor
in
the
hunt
said
young
hampton
of
course
such
a
thing
may
happen
anywhere
they
had
foxes
poisoned
in
the
pytchley
last
year
it
shows
a
d
bad
feeling
somewhere
said
the
master
we
know
very
well
where
the
feeling
is
said
bean
who
had
by
this
time
taken
up
the
fox
determined
not
to
allow
it
to
pass
into
any
hands
less
careful
than
his
own
it
that
scoundrel
goarly
said
one
of
the
botseys
then
there
was
an
indignant
murmur
heard
first
of
all
from
two
or
three
and
then
running
among
the
whole
crowd
everybody
knew
as
well
as
though
he
had
seen
it
that
goarly
had
baited
meat
with
strychnine
and
put
it
down
in
the
wood
might
have
half
the
pack
said
tony
tuppett
who
had
come
up
on
foot
from
the
barn
where
the
hounds
were
still
imprisoned
and
had
caught
hold
in
an
affectionate
manner
of
a
fore
pad
of
the
fox
which
bean
had
clutched
by
the
two
hind
legs
poor
tony
tuppett
almost
shed
tears
as
he
looked
at
the
dead
animal
and
thought
what
might
have
been
the
fate
of
the
pack
it
him
my
lord
he
said
as
we
run
through
littleton
gorse
monday
after
christmas
last
and
up
to
impington
park
where
he
got
away
from
us
in
a
hollow
tree
he
four
year
old
added
tony
looking
at
the
animal
mouth
and
there
war
a
finer
dog
fox
in
the
county
do
they
know
all
the
foxes
asked
the
senator
in
answer
to
this
morton
only
shook
his
head
not
feeling
quite
sure
himself
how
far
a
huntsman
acquaintance
in
that
line
might
go
and
being
also
too
much
impressed
by
the
occasion
for
speculative
conversation
it
that
scoundrel
goarly
had
been
repeated
again
and
again
and
then
on
a
sudden
goarly
himself
was
seen
standing
on
the
further
hedge
of
larry
field
with
a
gun
in
his
hand
he
was
not
at
this
time
above
two
hundred
yards
from
them
and
was
declared
by
one
of
the
young
farmers
to
be
grinning
with
delight
the
next
field
was
goarly
but
the
hedge
and
ditch
belonged
to
twentyman
larry
rushed
forward
as
though
determined
to
thrash
the
man
and
two
or
three
followed
him
but
lord
rufford
galloped
on
and
stopped
them
get
into
a
row
with
a
fellow
like
that
he
said
to
twentyman
he
on
my
land
my
lord
said
larry
impatiently
i
on
my
own
now
and
let
me
see
who
dare
to
touch
me
said
goarly
jumping
down
you
put
poison
down
in
that
wood
said
larry
no
i
did
but
i
knows
who
did
it
ai
i
as
am
afeard
for
my
young
turkeys
now
it
was
well
known
that
old
twentyman
larry
mother
was
fond
of
young
turkeys
and
that
her
had
suffered
larry
in
his
determination
to
be
a
gentleman
had
always
laughed
at
his
mother
losses
but
now
to
be
accused
in
this
way
was
terrible
to
his
feelings
he
made
a
rush
as
though
to
jump
over
the
hedge
but
lord
rufford
again
intercepted
him
i
think
twentyman
that
you
care
for
what
such
a
fellow
as
that
might
say
by
this
time
lord
rufford
was
off
his
horse
and
had
taken
hold
of
larry
i
tell
you
all
what
it
is
screamed
goarly
standing
just
at
the
edge
of
his
own
field
if
a
hound
comes
out
of
the
wood
on
to
my
land
i
shoot
him
i
do
know
nothing
about
though
i
dare
say
twentyman
does
but
if
a
hound
comes
on
my
land
shoot
him
open
before
you
all
there
was
however
no
danger
of
such
a
threat
being
executed
on
this
day
as
of
course
no
hound
would
be
allowed
to
go
into
dillsborough
wood
twentyman
was
reluctantly
brought
back
into
the
meadow
where
the
horses
were
standing
and
then
a
consultation
was
held
as
to
what
they
should
do
next
there
were
some
who
thought
that
the
hounds
should
be
taken
home
for
the
day
it
was
as
though
some
special
friend
of
the
had
died
that
morning
and
that
the
spirits
of
the
sportsmen
were
too
dejected
for
their
sport
others
with
prudent
foresight
suggested
that
the
hounds
might
run
back
from
some
distant
covert
to
dillsborough
and
that
there
should
be
no
hunting
till
the
wood
had
been
thoroughly
searched
but
the
strangers
especially
those
who
had
hired
horses
would
not
hear
of
this
and
after
considerable
delay
it
was
arranged
that
the
hounds
should
be
trotted
off
as
quickly
as
possible
to
impington
gorse
which
was
on
the
other
side
of
impington
park
and
fully
five
miles
distant
and
so
they
started
leaving
the
dead
fox
in
the
hands
of
bean
the
gamekeeper
is
this
the
sort
of
thing
that
occurs
every
day
asked
the
senator
as
he
got
back
into
the
carriage
i
should
fancy
not
answered
morton
somebody
has
poisoned
a
fox
and
i
do
think
that
that
is
very
often
done
about
here
why
did
he
poison
him
to
save
his
fowls
i
suppose
why
should
he
poison
him
if
the
fox
takes
his
fowls
fowls
are
better
than
foxes
not
in
this
country
said
morton
then
i
very
glad
i
do
live
here
said
gotobed
these
friends
of
yours
are
dressed
very
nicely
and
look
very
well
but
a
fox
is
a
nasty
animal
it
was
that
man
standing
up
on
the
bank
was
it
continued
the
senator
who
was
determined
to
understand
it
all
to
the
very
bottom
in
reference
to
certain
lectures
which
he
intended
to
give
on
his
return
to
the
states
and
perhaps
also
in
the
old
country
before
he
left
it
they
suspect
him
that
man
with
the
gun
one
man
against
two
hundred
now
i
respect
that
man
i
do
with
all
my
heart
you
better
not
say
so
here
mr
gotobed
i
know
how
full
of
prejudice
you
all
air
but
i
do
respect
him
if
i
comprehend
the
matter
rightly
he
was
on
his
own
land
when
we
saw
him
yes
that
was
his
own
field
and
they
meant
to
ride
across
it
whether
he
liked
it
or
no
everybody
rides
across
everybody
land
out
hunting
would
they
ride
across
your
park
morton
if
you
did
let
them
certainly
they
would
and
break
down
all
my
gates
if
i
had
them
locked
and
pull
down
my
park
palings
to
let
the
hounds
through
and
you
could
get
no
compensation
practically
i
could
get
none
and
certainly
i
should
not
try
the
greatest
enemy
to
hunting
in
the
whole
county
would
not
be
foolish
enough
to
make
the
attempt
why
so
he
would
get
no
satisfaction
and
everybody
would
hate
him
then
i
respect
that
man
the
more
what
is
that
man
name
morton
had
heard
the
name
or
had
forgotten
it
i
shall
find
that
man
out
and
have
some
conversation
with
him
morton
i
respect
that
man
morton
he
one
against
two
hundred
and
he
insists
upon
his
rights
those
men
standing
round
and
wiping
their
eyes
and
stifled
with
grief
because
a
fox
had
been
poisoned
as
though
some
great
patriot
had
died
among
them
in
the
service
of
his
country
formed
one
of
the
most
remarkable
phenomena
sir
that
ever
i
beheld
in
any
country
when
i
get
among
my
own
people
in
mickewa
and
tell
them
that
they
wo
believe
me
sir
in
the
meantime
the
cavalcade
was
hurrying
away
to
impington
gorse
and
john
morton
feeling
that
he
had
not
had
an
opportunity
as
yet
of
showing
his
american
friend
the
best
side
of
hunting
went
with
them
the
five
miles
were
five
long
miles
and
as
the
pace
was
not
above
seven
miles
an
hour
nearly
an
hour
was
occupied
there
was
therefore
plenty
of
opportunity
for
the
senator
to
inquire
whether
the
gentlemen
around
him
were
as
yet
enjoying
their
sport
there
was
an
air
of
triumph
about
him
as
to
the
misfortunes
of
the
day
joined
to
a
battery
of
continued
raillery
which
made
it
almost
impossible
for
morton
to
keep
his
temper
he
asked
whether
it
was
not
at
any
rate
better
than
trotting
a
pair
of
horses
backwards
and
forwards
over
the
same
mile
of
road
for
half
the
day
as
is
the
custom
in
the
states
but
the
senator
though
he
did
not
quite
approve
of
trotting
matches
argued
that
there
was
infinitely
more
of
skill
and
ingenuity
in
the
american
pastime
everybody
is
so
gloomy
said
the
senator
lighting
his
third
cigar
i
been
watching
that
young
man
in
pink
boots
for
the
last
half
hour
and
he
has
spoken
a
word
to
any
one
perhaps
he
a
stranger
said
morton
and
that
the
way
you
treat
him
it
was
past
two
when
the
hounds
were
put
into
the
gorse
and
certainly
no
one
was
in
a
very
good
humour
a
trot
of
five
miles
is
disagreeable
and
two
in
november
is
late
for
finding
a
first
fox
and
then
poisoning
is
a
vice
that
may
grow
into
a
habit
there
was
a
general
feeling
that
goarly
ought
to
be
extinguished
but
an
idea
that
it
might
be
difficult
to
extinguish
him
the
whips
nevertheless
cantered
on
to
the
corner
of
the
covert
and
tony
put
in
his
hounds
with
a
cheery
voice
the
senator
remarked
that
the
gorse
was
a
very
little
place
for
as
they
were
on
the
side
of
an
opposite
hill
they
could
see
it
all
lord
rufford
who
was
standing
by
the
carriage
explained
to
him
that
it
was
a
favourite
resort
of
foxes
and
difficult
to
draw
as
being
very
close
perhaps
poisoned
him
too
said
the
senator
it
was
evident
from
his
voice
that
had
such
been
the
case
he
would
not
have
been
among
the
mourners
the
blackguards
are
not
yet
thick
enough
in
our
country
for
that
said
lord
rufford
meaning
to
be
sarcastic
then
a
whimper
was
heard
from
a
hound
at
first
very
low
and
then
growing
into
a
fuller
sound
there
he
is
said
young
hampton
for
heaven
sake
get
those
fellows
away
from
that
side
glomax
this
was
uttered
with
so
much
vehemence
that
the
senator
looked
up
in
surprise
then
the
captain
galloped
round
the
side
of
the
covert
and
making
use
of
some
strong
language
stopped
the
ardour
of
certain
gentlemen
who
were
in
a
hurry
to
get
away
on
what
they
considered
good
terms
lord
rufford
hampton
larry
twentyman
and
others
sat
on
their
horses
watching
the
gorse
ned
botsey
urged
himself
a
little
forward
down
the
hill
and
was
creeping
on
when
captain
glomax
asked
him
whether
he
would
be
so
obliging
kind
as
to
remain
where
he
was
for
half
a
minute
ned
took
the
observations
in
good
part
and
stopped
his
horse
does
he
do
all
that
cursing
and
swearing
for
the
asked
the
senator
the
fox
traversed
the
gorse
back
from
side
to
side
and
from
corner
to
corner
again
and
again
there
were
two
sides
certainly
at
which
he
might
break
but
though
he
came
out
more
than
once
he
could
not
be
got
to
go
away
they
kill
him
now
before
he
breaks
said
the
elder
botsey
brute
exclaimed
his
brother
they
hot
on
him
now
said
hampton
at
this
time
the
whole
side
of
the
hill
was
ringing
with
the
music
of
the
hounds
he
was
out
then
but
dick
turned
him
said
larry
dick
was
one
of
the
whips
will
you
be
so
kind
morton
asked
the
senator
as
to
tell
me
whether
they
hunting
yet
they
been
at
it
for
three
hours
and
a
half
and
i
should
like
to
know
when
they
begin
to
amuse
themselves
just
as
he
had
spoken
there
came
from
dick
a
cry
that
he
was
away
tony
who
had
been
down
at
the
side
of
the
gorse
at
once
jumped
into
it
knowing
the
passage
through
lord
rufford
who
for
the
last
five
or
six
minutes
had
sat
perfectly
still
on
his
horse
started
down
the
hill
as
though
he
had
been
thrown
from
a
catapult
there
was
a
little
through
which
it
was
expedient
to
pass
and
in
a
minute
a
score
of
men
were
jostling
for
the
way
among
whom
were
the
two
botseys
our
friend
runciman
and
larry
twentyman
with
kate
masters
on
the
pony
close
behind
him
young
hampton
jumped
a
very
nasty
fence
by
the
side
of
the
wicket
and
lord
rufford
followed
him
a
score
of
elderly
men
with
some
young
men
among
them
too
turned
back
into
a
lane
behind
them
having
watched
long
enough
to
see
that
they
were
to
take
the
lane
to
the
left
and
not
the
lane
to
the
right
after
all
there
was
time
enough
for
when
the
men
had
got
through
the
the
hounds
were
hardly
free
of
the
covert
and
tony
riding
up
the
side
of
the
hill
opposite
was
still
blowing
his
horn
but
they
were
off
at
last
and
the
bulk
of
the
field
got
away
on
good
terms
with
the
hounds
now
they
are
hunting
said
morton
to
the
senator
they
all
seemed
to
be
very
angry
with
each
other
at
that
narrow
gate
they
were
in
a
hurry
i
suppose
two
of
them
jumped
over
the
hedge
why
did
they
all
jump
how
long
will
it
be
now
before
they
catch
him
very
probably
they
may
not
catch
him
at
all
not
catch
him
after
all
that
then
the
man
was
certainly
right
to
poison
that
other
fox
in
the
wood
how
long
will
they
go
on
half
an
hour
perhaps
and
you
call
that
hunting
is
it
worth
the
while
of
all
those
men
to
expend
all
that
energy
for
such
a
result
upon
the
whole
morton
i
should
say
that
it
is
one
of
the
most
incomprehensible
things
that
i
have
ever
seen
in
the
course
of
a
rather
long
and
varied
life
shooting
i
can
understand
for
you
have
your
birds
fishing
i
can
understand
as
you
have
your
fish
here
you
get
a
fox
to
begin
with
and
are
all
then
you
come
across
another
after
riding
about
all
day
and
the
chances
are
you
ca
catch
him
i
suppose
said
morton
angrily
the
habits
of
one
country
are
incomprehensible
to
the
people
of
another
when
i
see
americans
loafing
about
in
the
of
an
hotel
i
am
lost
in
amazement
there
is
not
a
man
you
see
who
could
give
a
reason
for
his
being
there
he
has
an
object
in
view
though
perhaps
it
may
be
no
better
than
to
rob
his
neighbour
but
here
there
seems
to
be
no
possible
motive
chapter
xi
from
impington
gorse
the
fox
ran
straight
from
the
covert
through
his
haunts
to
impington
park
and
as
the
hounds
were
astray
there
for
two
or
three
minutes
there
was
a
general
idea
that
he
too
had
got
up
into
a
tree
which
would
have
amused
the
senator
very
much
had
the
senator
been
there
but
neither
had
the
country
nor
the
pace
been
adapted
to
wheels
and
the
senator
and
the
paragon
were
now
returning
along
the
road
towards
bragton
the
fox
had
tried
his
old
earths
at
impington
high
wood
and
had
then
skulked
back
along
the
outside
of
the
covert
had
not
one
of
the
whips
seen
him
he
would
have
been
troubled
no
further
on
that
day
a
fact
which
if
it
could
have
been
explained
to
the
senator
in
all
its
bearings
would
greatly
have
added
to
his
delight
but
dick
viewed
him
and
with
many
holloas
and
much
blowing
of
horns
and
prayers
from
captain
glomax
that
gentlemen
would
only
be
so
good
as
to
hold
their
tongues
and
a
volley
of
abuse
from
half
the
field
against
an
unfortunate
gentleman
who
rode
after
the
escaping
fox
before
a
hound
was
out
of
the
covert
they
settled
again
to
their
business
it
was
pretty
to
see
the
quiet
ease
and
apparent
nonchalance
and
almost
affected
absence
of
bustle
of
those
who
knew
their
work
among
whom
were
especially
to
be
named
young
hampton
and
the
elder
botsey
and
lord
rufford
and
above
all
a
sombre
military
man
who
had
been
in
the
carriage
with
lord
rufford
and
who
had
hardly
spoken
a
word
to
any
one
the
whole
day
this
was
the
celebrated
major
caneback
known
to
all
the
world
as
one
of
the
dullest
men
and
best
riders
across
country
that
england
had
ever
produced
but
he
was
not
so
dull
but
that
he
knew
how
to
make
use
of
his
accomplishment
so
as
always
to
be
able
to
get
a
mount
on
a
friend
horses
if
a
man
wanted
to
make
a
horse
or
to
try
a
horse
or
to
sell
a
horse
or
to
buy
a
horse
he
delighted
to
put
major
caneback
up
the
major
was
sympathetic
and
made
his
friend
horses
and
tried
them
and
sold
them
then
he
would
take
his
two
bottles
of
wine
of
course
from
his
friend
cellar
and
when
asked
about
the
day
sport
would
be
oracular
in
two
words
rather
slow
quick
spurt
goodish
thing
regularly
mulled
and
such
like
nevertheless
it
was
a
great
thing
to
have
major
caneback
with
you
to
the
list
of
those
who
rode
well
and
quietly
must
in
justice
be
added
our
friend
larry
twentyman
who
was
in
truth
a
good
horseman
and
he
had
three
things
to
do
which
it
was
difficult
enough
to
combine
he
had
a
young
horse
which
he
would
have
liked
to
sell
he
had
to
coach
kate
masters
on
his
pony
and
he
desired
to
ride
like
major
caneback
from
impington
park
they
went
in
a
straight
line
to
littleton
gorse
skirting
certain
small
woods
which
the
fox
disdained
to
enter
here
the
pace
was
very
good
and
the
country
was
all
grass
it
was
the
very
cream
of
the
and
could
the
senator
have
read
the
feelings
of
the
dozen
leading
men
in
the
run
he
would
have
owned
that
they
were
for
the
time
satisfied
with
their
amusement
could
he
have
read
kate
masters
feelings
he
would
have
had
to
own
that
she
was
in
an
earthly
paradise
when
the
pony
paused
at
the
big
brook
brought
his
four
legs
steadily
down
on
the
brink
as
though
he
were
going
to
bathe
then
with
a
bend
of
his
back
leaped
to
the
other
side
dropping
his
hind
legs
in
and
instantly
recovering
them
and
when
she
saw
that
larry
had
waited
just
a
moment
for
her
watching
to
see
what
might
be
her
fate
she
was
in
heaven
was
it
a
big
one
larry
she
asked
in
her
triumph
he
did
go
in
behind
those
cats
of
things
always
do
it
somehow
larry
replied
darting
forward
again
and
keeping
the
major
well
in
his
eye
the
brook
had
stopped
one
or
two
and
tidings
came
up
that
ned
botsey
had
broken
his
horse
back
the
knowledge
of
the
brook
had
sent
some
round
by
the
road
steady
riding
men
such
as
runciman
and
doctor
nupper
captain
glomax
had
got
into
it
and
came
up
afterwards
wet
through
with
temper
by
no
means
improved
but
the
glory
of
the
day
had
been
the
way
in
which
lord
rufford
young
bay
mare
who
had
never
seen
a
brook
before
had
flown
over
it
with
the
major
on
her
back
taking
it
as
larry
afterwards
described
just
in
her
stride
without
condescending
to
look
at
it
i
was
just
behind
the
major
and
saw
her
do
it
larry
understood
that
a
man
should
never
talk
of
his
own
place
in
a
run
but
he
did
quite
understand
that
neither
should
he
talk
of
having
been
close
to
another
man
who
was
supposed
to
have
had
the
best
of
it
lord
rufford
who
did
talk
much
of
these
things
quite
understood
that
he
had
received
full
value
for
his
billet
and
mount
in
the
improved
character
of
his
mare
then
there
was
a
little
difficulty
at
the
boundary
fence
of
impington
hall
farm
the
major
who
did
know
the
ground
tried
it
at
an
impracticable
place
and
brought
his
mare
down
but
she
fell
at
the
right
side
and
he
was
quick
enough
in
getting
away
from
her
not
to
fall
under
her
in
the
ditch
tony
tuppet
who
knew
every
foot
of
that
double
ditch
and
bank
and
every
foot
in
the
hedge
above
kept
well
to
the
left
and
crept
through
a
spot
where
one
ditch
ran
into
the
other
intersecting
of
the
fence
tony
like
a
knowing
huntsman
as
he
was
rode
always
for
the
finish
and
not
for
immediate
glory
both
lord
rufford
and
hampton
who
in
spite
of
their
affected
nonchalance
were
in
truth
rather
riding
against
one
another
took
it
all
in
a
fly
choosing
a
lighter
spot
than
that
which
the
major
had
encountered
larry
had
longed
to
follow
them
or
rather
to
take
it
alongside
of
them
but
was
mindful
at
last
of
kate
and
hurried
down
the
ditch
to
the
spot
which
tony
had
chosen
and
which
was
now
crowded
by
horsemen
he
would
have
done
it
as
well
as
the
best
of
them
said
kate
panting
for
breath
we
all
right
said
larry
follow
me
do
let
them
hustle
you
out
now
mat
ca
you
make
way
for
a
lady
half
a
minute
mat
growled
quite
understanding
the
use
which
was
being
made
of
kate
masters
but
he
did
give
way
and
was
rewarded
with
a
gracious
smile
you
are
going
uncommon
well
miss
kate
said
mat
and
i
wo
stop
you
i
am
so
much
obliged
to
you
ruggles
said
kate
not
scrupling
for
a
moment
to
take
the
advantage
offered
her
the
fox
had
turned
a
little
to
the
left
which
was
in
larry
favour
and
the
major
was
now
close
to
him
covered
on
one
side
with
mud
but
still
looking
as
though
the
mud
were
all
right
there
are
some
men
who
can
crush
their
hats
have
their
boots
and
breeches
full
of
water
and
be
covered
with
dirt
from
their
faces
downwards
and
yet
look
as
though
nothing
were
amiss
while
with
others
the
marks
of
a
fall
are
always
provocative
either
of
pity
or
ridicule
i
hope
you
not
hurt
major
caneback
said
larry
glad
of
the
occasion
to
speak
to
so
distinguished
an
individual
the
major
grunted
as
he
rode
on
finding
no
necessity
here
even
for
his
customary
two
words
little
accidents
such
as
that
were
the
price
he
paid
for
his
entertainment
as
they
got
within
view
of
littleton
gorse
hampton
lord
rufford
and
tony
had
the
best
of
it
though
two
or
three
farmers
were
very
close
to
them
at
this
moment
tony
mind
was
much
disturbed
and
he
looked
round
more
than
once
for
captain
glomax
captain
glomax
had
got
into
the
brook
and
had
then
ridden
down
to
the
high
road
which
ran
here
near
to
them
and
which
as
he
knew
ran
within
one
field
of
the
gorse
he
had
lost
his
place
and
had
got
a
ducking
and
was
a
little
out
of
humour
with
things
in
general
it
had
not
been
his
purpose
to
go
to
impington
on
this
day
and
he
was
still
in
his
mind
saying
evil
things
of
the
respecting
that
poisoned
fox
perhaps
he
was
thinking
as
itinerant
masters
often
must
think
that
it
was
very
hard
to
have
to
bear
so
many
unpleasant
things
for
a
poor
a
year
and
meditating
as
he
had
done
for
the
last
two
seasons
a
threat
that
unless
the
money
were
increased
he
would
hunt
the
country
more
than
three
times
a
week
as
tony
got
near
to
the
gorse
and
also
near
to
the
road
he
managed
with
infinite
skill
to
get
the
hounds
off
the
scent
and
to
make
a
fictitious
cast
to
the
left
as
though
he
thought
the
fox
had
traversed
that
way
tony
knew
well
enough
that
the
fox
was
at
that
moment
in
littleton
gorse
but
he
knew
also
that
the
gorse
was
only
six
acres
that
such
a
fox
as
he
had
before
him
would
stay
there
two
minutes
after
the
first
hound
was
in
it
and
that
dillsborough
wood
which
to
his
imagination
was
full
of
poison
would
then
be
only
a
mile
and
a
half
before
him
tony
whose
fault
was
a
tendency
to
mystery
as
is
the
fault
of
most
huntsmen
having
accomplished
his
object
in
stopping
the
hounds
pretended
to
cast
about
with
great
diligence
he
crossed
the
road
and
was
down
one
side
of
a
field
and
along
another
looking
anxiously
for
the
captain
the
fox
has
gone
on
to
the
gorse
said
the
elder
botsey
what
a
stupid
old
pig
he
is
meaning
that
tony
tuppett
was
the
pig
he
was
seen
going
on
said
larry
who
had
come
across
a
man
mending
a
drain
it
would
be
his
run
of
course
said
hampton
who
was
generally
up
to
tony
wiles
but
who
was
now
as
much
in
the
dark
as
others
then
four
or
five
rode
up
to
the
huntsman
and
told
him
that
the
fox
had
been
seen
heading
for
the
gorse
tony
said
not
a
word
but
bit
his
lips
and
scratched
his
head
and
bethought
himself
what
fools
men
might
be
even
though
they
did
ride
well
to
hounds
one
word
of
explanation
would
have
settled
it
all
but
he
would
not
speak
that
word
till
he
whispered
it
to
captain
glomax
in
the
meantime
there
was
a
crowd
in
the
road
waiting
to
see
the
result
of
tony
manoeuvres
and
then
as
is
usual
on
such
occasions
a
little
mild
repartee
went
about
what
the
sportsmen
themselves
would
have
called
chaff
ned
botsey
came
up
not
having
broken
his
horse
back
as
had
been
rumoured
but
having
had
to
drag
the
brute
out
of
the
brook
with
the
help
of
two
countrymen
and
the
major
was
asked
about
his
fall
till
he
was
forced
to
open
his
mouth
double
ditch
mare
fell
matter
of
course
and
then
he
got
himself
out
of
the
crowd
disgusted
with
the
littleness
of
mankind
lord
rufford
had
been
riding
a
very
big
chestnut
horse
and
had
watched
the
anxious
struggles
of
kate
masters
to
hold
her
place
kate
though
fifteen
and
quite
up
to
that
age
in
intelligence
and
impudence
was
small
and
looked
almost
a
child
that
a
nice
pony
of
yours
my
dear
said
the
lord
kate
who
did
quite
like
being
called
my
dear
but
who
knew
that
a
lord
has
privileges
said
that
it
was
a
very
good
pony
suppose
we
change
said
his
lordship
could
you
ride
my
horse
he
very
big
said
kate
you
look
like
a
on
a
haystack
said
his
lordship
and
if
you
got
on
my
pony
you
look
like
a
haystack
on
a
said
kate
then
it
was
felt
that
kate
masters
had
had
the
best
of
that
little
encounter
yes
i
got
one
there
said
lord
rufford
while
his
friends
were
laughing
at
him
at
length
captain
glomax
was
seen
in
the
road
and
tony
was
with
him
at
once
whispering
in
his
ear
that
the
hounds
if
allowed
to
go
on
would
certainly
run
into
dillsborough
wood
d
the
hounds
muttered
the
captain
but
he
knew
too
well
what
he
was
about
to
face
so
terrible
a
danger
they
going
home
he
said
as
soon
as
he
had
joined
lord
rufford
and
the
crowd
going
home
exclaimed
a
young
rider
of
a
hired
horse
which
had
been
going
well
with
him
and
as
he
said
so
he
looked
at
his
watch
unless
you
particularly
wish
me
to
take
the
hounds
to
some
covert
twenty
miles
off
answered
the
sarcastic
master
the
fox
certainly
went
on
to
littleton
said
the
elder
botsey
my
dear
fellow
said
the
captain
i
can
tell
you
where
the
fox
went
quite
as
well
as
you
can
tell
me
do
allow
a
man
to
know
what
he
about
some
times
it
is
generally
the
custom
here
to
take
the
hounds
off
a
running
fox
continued
botsey
who
subscribed
and
did
not
like
being
snubbed
and
it
is
generally
the
custom
to
have
poisoned
said
the
captain
assuming
to
himself
the
credit
due
to
sagacity
if
you
wish
to
be
master
of
these
hounds
i
have
the
slightest
objection
but
while
i
responsible
you
must
allow
me
to
do
my
work
according
to
my
own
judgment
then
the
thing
was
understood
and
captain
glomax
was
allowed
to
carry
off
the
hounds
and
his
without
another
word
but
just
at
that
moment
while
the
hounds
and
the
master
and
lord
rufford
and
his
friends
were
turning
back
in
their
own
direction
john
morton
came
up
with
his
carriage
and
the
senator
is
it
all
over
asked
the
senator
all
over
for
said
lord
rufford
did
you
catch
the
animal
no
gotobed
we
could
catch
him
to
tell
the
truth
we
try
but
we
had
a
nice
little
skurry
for
four
or
five
miles
some
of
you
look
very
wet
captain
glomax
and
ned
botsey
were
standing
near
the
carriage
but
the
captain
as
soon
as
he
heard
this
broke
into
a
trot
and
followed
the
hounds
some
of
us
are
very
wet
said
ned
that
part
of
the
fun
oh
that
part
of
the
fun
you
found
one
fox
dead
and
you
kill
another
because
you
did
try
well
morton
i
do
think
i
shall
take
to
fox
hunting
even
though
they
should
introduce
it
in
mickewa
what
become
of
the
rest
of
the
men
most
of
them
are
in
the
brook
said
ned
botsey
as
he
rode
on
towards
dillsborough
runciman
was
also
there
and
trotted
on
homewards
with
botsey
larry
and
kate
masters
i
think
i
won
my
bet
said
the
i
do
see
that
at
all
we
did
find
in
dillsborough
wood
i
say
we
did
find
in
dillsborough
wood
we
found
a
fox
though
unfortunately
the
poor
brute
was
dead
the
bet
off
i
should
say
what
do
you
say
larry
then
runciman
argued
his
case
at
great
length
and
with
much
ability
it
had
been
intended
that
the
bet
should
be
governed
by
the
fact
whether
dillsborough
wood
did
or
did
not
contain
a
fox
on
that
morning
he
himself
had
backed
the
wood
and
botsey
had
been
strong
in
his
opinion
against
the
wood
which
of
them
had
been
practically
right
had
not
the
presence
of
the
poisoned
fox
shown
that
he
was
right
i
think
you
ought
to
pay
said
larry
all
right
said
botsey
riding
on
and
telling
himself
that
that
was
what
came
from
making
a
bet
with
a
man
who
was
not
a
gentleman
he
as
unhappy
about
that
hat
said
runciman
as
though
beer
had
gone
down
a
penny
a
gallon
chapter
xii
arabella
trefoil
on
the
sunday
the
party
from
bragton
went
to
the
parish
church
and
found
it
very
cold
the
duty
was
done
by
a
young
curate
who
lived
in
dillsborough
there
being
no
house
in
bragton
for
him
the
rector
himself
had
not
been
in
the
church
for
the
last
six
months
being
an
invalid
at
present
he
and
his
wife
were
away
in
london
but
the
vicarage
was
kept
up
for
his
use
the
service
was
certainly
not
alluring
it
was
a
very
wet
morning
and
the
curate
had
ridden
over
from
dillsborough
on
a
little
pony
which
the
rector
kept
for
him
in
addition
to
the
per
annum
paid
for
his
services
that
he
should
have
got
over
his
service
quickly
was
not
a
matter
of
surprise
nor
was
it
wonderful
that
there
should
have
been
no
matter
in
his
discourse
as
he
had
two
sermons
to
preach
every
week
and
to
perform
all
the
other
clerical
duties
of
a
parish
lying
four
miles
distant
from
his
lodgings
perhaps
had
he
expected
the
presence
of
so
distinguished
a
critic
as
the
senator
from
mickewa
he
might
have
done
better
as
it
was
being
nearly
wet
through
and
muddy
up
to
his
knees
he
did
not
do
the
work
very
well
when
morton
and
his
friends
left
the
church
and
got
into
the
carriage
for
their
drive
home
across
the
park
morton
was
the
first
to
speak
john
she
said
that
church
is
enough
to
give
any
woman
her
death
i
wo
go
there
any
more
they
do
understand
warming
a
church
in
the
country
said
john
apologetically
is
it
not
a
little
too
large
for
the
congregation
asked
the
senator
the
church
was
large
and
straggling
and
ill
arranged
and
on
this
particular
sunday
had
been
almost
empty
there
was
in
it
an
harmonium
which
puttock
played
when
she
was
at
home
but
in
her
absence
the
attempt
made
by
a
few
rustics
to
sing
the
hymns
had
not
been
a
musical
success
the
whole
affair
had
been
very
sad
and
so
the
paragon
had
felt
it
who
knew
and
was
remembering
through
the
whole
service
how
these
things
are
done
in
transatlantic
cities
the
weather
kept
the
people
away
i
suppose
said
morton
does
that
gentleman
generally
draw
large
congregations
asked
the
persistent
senator
we
do
go
in
for
drawing
congregations
here
under
the
of
his
guest
the
secretary
of
legation
almost
lost
his
diplomatic
good
temper
we
have
a
church
in
every
parish
for
those
who
choose
to
attend
it
and
very
few
do
choose
said
the
senator
i
ca
say
that
wrong
there
seemed
at
the
moment
to
be
no
necessity
to
carry
the
disagreeable
conversation
any
further
as
they
had
now
reached
the
house
morton
immediately
went
and
the
two
gentlemen
took
themselves
to
the
fire
in
the
library
which
room
was
being
used
as
more
commodious
than
the
big
gotobed
placed
himself
on
the
rug
with
his
back
to
the
fire
and
immediately
reverted
to
the
church
that
gentleman
is
paid
by
tithes
i
suppose
he
not
the
rector
he
a
curate
ah
just
so
he
looked
like
a
curate
does
the
rector
do
anything
then
morton
who
was
by
this
time
heartily
sick
of
explaining
explained
the
unfortunate
state
of
puttock
health
and
the
conversation
was
carried
on
till
gradually
the
senator
learned
that
puttock
received
a
year
and
a
house
for
doing
nothing
and
that
he
paid
his
deputy
a
year
with
the
use
of
a
pony
and
how
long
will
that
be
allowed
to
go
on
mr
morton
asked
the
senator
to
all
these
inquiries
morton
found
himself
compelled
not
only
to
answer
but
to
answer
the
truth
any
prevarication
or
attempt
at
mystification
fell
to
the
ground
at
once
under
the
tremendous
powers
of
inquiry
it
had
been
going
on
for
four
years
and
would
probably
go
on
now
till
puttock
died
a
man
of
his
age
with
the
asthma
may
live
for
twenty
years
said
the
senator
who
had
already
learned
that
puttock
was
only
fifty
then
he
ascertained
that
puttock
had
not
been
presented
to
or
selected
for
the
living
on
account
of
any
peculiar
fitness
but
that
he
had
been
a
fellow
of
rufford
at
oxford
till
he
was
when
he
had
thought
it
well
to
marry
and
take
a
living
but
he
must
have
been
asthmatic
then
said
the
senator
he
may
have
had
all
the
ailments
endured
by
the
human
race
for
anything
i
know
said
the
unhappy
host
and
for
anything
the
bishop
cared
as
far
as
i
can
see
said
the
senator
well
now
i
guess
that
could
occur
in
our
country
a
minister
may
turn
out
badly
with
us
as
well
as
with
you
but
we
appoint
a
man
without
inquiry
as
to
his
fitness
and
if
a
man
do
his
duty
he
has
to
give
way
to
some
one
who
can
if
the
sick
gentleman
took
the
small
portion
of
the
stipend
and
the
working
man
the
larger
would
not
better
justice
be
done
and
the
people
better
served
puttock
has
a
freehold
in
the
parish
a
freehold
possession
of
men
souls
the
fact
is
morton
that
the
spirit
of
conservatism
in
this
country
is
so
strong
that
you
can
not
bear
to
part
with
a
shred
of
the
barbarism
of
the
middle
ages
and
when
a
rag
is
sent
to
the
winds
you
shriek
with
agony
at
the
disruption
and
think
that
the
wound
will
be
mortal
as
gotobed
said
this
he
extended
his
right
hand
and
laid
his
left
on
his
breast
as
though
he
were
addressing
the
senate
from
his
own
chair
morton
who
had
offered
to
entertain
the
gentleman
for
ten
days
sincerely
wished
that
he
were
doing
so
on
the
monday
afternoon
the
trefoils
arrived
morton
with
his
grandmother
and
both
the
carriages
went
down
to
receive
them
with
a
cart
also
for
the
luggage
which
was
fortunate
as
arabella
trefoil
big
box
was
very
big
indeed
and
lady
augustus
though
she
was
economical
in
most
things
had
brought
a
comfortable
amount
of
clothes
each
of
them
had
her
own
lady
maid
so
that
the
two
carriages
were
necessary
how
it
was
that
these
ladies
lived
so
luxuriously
was
a
mystery
to
their
friends
as
for
some
time
past
they
had
enjoyed
no
particular
income
of
their
own
lord
augustus
had
spent
everything
that
came
to
his
hand
and
the
family
owned
no
house
at
all
nevertheless
arabella
trefoil
was
to
be
seen
at
all
parties
magnificently
dressed
and
never
stirred
anywhere
without
her
own
maid
it
would
have
been
as
grievous
to
her
to
be
called
on
to
live
without
food
as
to
go
without
this
necessary
appendage
she
was
a
big
fair
girl
whose
copious
hair
was
managed
after
such
a
fashion
that
no
one
could
guess
what
was
her
own
and
what
was
purchased
she
certainly
had
fine
eyes
though
i
could
never
imagine
how
any
one
could
look
at
them
and
think
it
possible
that
she
should
be
in
love
they
were
very
large
beautifully
blue
but
never
bright
and
the
eyebrows
over
them
were
perfect
her
cheeks
were
somewhat
too
long
and
the
distance
from
her
nose
to
her
upper
lip
too
great
her
mouth
was
small
and
her
teeth
excellent
but
the
charm
of
which
men
spoke
the
most
was
the
brilliance
of
her
complexion
if
as
the
ladies
said
it
was
all
paint
she
or
her
maid
must
have
been
a
great
artist
it
never
betrayed
itself
to
be
paint
but
the
beauty
on
which
she
prided
herself
was
the
grace
of
her
motion
though
she
was
tall
and
big
she
never
allowed
an
awkward
movement
to
escape
from
her
she
certainly
did
it
very
well
no
young
woman
could
walk
across
an
archery
ground
with
a
finer
step
or
manage
a
train
with
more
perfect
ease
or
sit
upon
her
horse
with
a
more
complete
look
of
being
at
home
there
no
doubt
she
was
slow
but
though
slow
she
never
seemed
to
drag
now
she
was
after
a
certain
fashion
engaged
to
marry
john
morton
and
perhaps
she
was
one
of
the
most
unhappy
young
persons
in
england
she
had
long
known
that
it
was
her
duty
to
marry
and
especially
her
duty
to
marry
well
between
her
and
her
mother
there
had
been
no
reticence
on
this
subject
with
worldly
people
in
general
though
the
worldliness
is
manifest
enough
and
is
taught
by
plain
lessons
from
parents
to
their
children
yet
there
is
generally
some
thin
veil
even
among
themselves
some
transparent
tissue
of
lies
which
though
they
never
quite
hope
to
deceive
each
other
does
produce
among
them
something
of
the
comfort
of
deceit
but
between
lady
augustus
and
her
daughter
there
had
for
many
years
been
nothing
of
the
kind
the
daughter
herself
had
been
too
honest
for
it
as
for
caring
about
him
mamma
she
had
once
said
speaking
of
a
suitor
of
course
i
do
he
is
nasty
and
odious
in
every
way
but
i
have
got
to
do
the
best
i
can
and
what
is
the
use
of
talking
about
such
trash
as
that
then
there
had
been
no
more
trash
between
them
it
was
not
john
morton
whom
arabella
trefoil
had
called
nasty
and
odious
she
had
had
many
lovers
and
had
been
engaged
to
not
a
few
and
perhaps
she
liked
john
morton
as
well
as
any
of
them
except
one
he
was
quiet
and
looked
like
a
gentleman
and
was
reputed
for
no
vices
nor
did
she
quarrel
with
her
fate
in
that
he
himself
was
not
addicted
to
any
pleasures
she
herself
did
not
care
much
for
pleasure
but
she
did
care
to
be
a
great
lady
one
who
would
be
allowed
to
swim
out
of
rooms
before
others
one
who
could
snub
others
one
who
could
show
real
diamonds
when
others
wore
paste
one
who
might
be
sure
to
be
asked
everywhere
even
by
the
people
who
hated
her
she
rather
liked
being
hated
by
women
and
did
not
want
any
man
to
be
in
love
with
her
except
as
far
as
might
be
sufficient
for
the
purpose
of
marriage
the
real
diamonds
and
the
high
rank
would
not
be
hers
with
john
morton
she
would
have
to
be
content
with
such
rank
as
is
accorded
to
ministers
at
the
courts
at
which
they
are
employed
the
fall
would
be
great
from
what
she
had
once
expected
and
therefore
she
was
miserable
there
had
been
a
young
man
of
immense
wealth
of
great
rank
whom
at
one
time
she
really
had
fancied
that
she
had
loved
but
just
as
she
was
landing
her
prey
the
prey
had
been
rescued
from
her
by
powerful
friends
and
she
had
been
all
but
morton
fortune
was
in
her
eyes
small
and
she
was
beginning
to
learn
that
he
knew
how
to
take
care
of
his
own
money
already
there
had
been
difficulties
as
to
settlements
difficulties
as
to
difficulties
as
to
residence
lady
augustus
having
been
very
urgent
john
morton
who
had
really
been
captivated
by
the
beauty
of
arabella
was
quite
in
earnest
but
there
were
subjects
on
which
he
would
not
give
way
he
was
anxious
to
put
his
best
leg
foremost
so
that
the
beauty
might
be
satisfied
and
might
become
his
own
but
there
was
a
limit
beyond
which
he
would
not
go
lady
augustus
had
more
than
once
said
to
her
daughter
that
it
would
not
do
and
then
there
would
be
all
the
weary
work
to
do
again
nobody
seeing
the
meeting
on
the
platform
would
have
imagined
that
morton
and
miss
trefoil
were
lovers
and
as
for
lady
augustus
it
would
have
been
thought
that
she
was
in
some
special
degree
offended
with
the
gentleman
who
had
come
to
meet
her
she
just
gave
him
the
tip
of
her
fingers
and
then
turned
away
to
her
maid
and
called
for
the
porters
and
made
herself
particular
and
disagreeable
arabella
vouchsafed
a
cold
smile
but
then
her
smiles
were
always
cold
after
that
she
stood
still
and
shivered
are
you
cold
asked
morton
she
shook
her
head
and
shivered
again
perhaps
you
are
tired
then
she
nodded
her
head
when
her
maid
came
to
her
in
some
trouble
about
the
luggage
she
begged
that
she
might
not
be
bothered
saying
that
no
doubt
her
mother
knew
all
about
it
can
i
do
anything
asked
morton
nothing
at
all
i
should
think
said
miss
trefoil
in
the
meantime
old
morton
was
standing
by
as
black
as
thunder
for
the
trefoil
ladies
had
hardly
noticed
her
the
luggage
turned
up
all
right
at
last
as
luggage
always
does
and
was
stowed
away
in
the
cart
then
came
the
carriage
arrangement
morton
had
intended
that
the
two
elder
ladies
should
go
together
with
one
of
the
maids
and
that
he
should
put
his
love
into
the
other
which
having
a
seat
behind
could
accommodate
the
second
girl
without
disturbing
them
in
the
carriage
but
lady
augustus
had
made
some
exception
to
this
and
had
begged
that
her
daughter
might
be
seated
with
herself
it
was
a
point
which
morton
could
not
contest
out
there
among
the
porters
and
drivers
so
that
at
last
he
and
his
grandmother
had
the
phaeton
together
with
the
two
maids
in
the
rumble
i
never
saw
such
manners
in
all
my
life
said
the
honourable
morton
almost
bursting
with
passion
they
are
cold
and
tired
no
lady
should
be
too
cold
or
too
tired
to
conduct
herself
with
propriety
no
real
lady
is
ever
so
the
place
is
strange
to
them
you
know
i
hope
with
all
my
heart
that
it
may
never
be
otherwise
than
strange
to
them
when
they
arrived
at
the
house
the
strangers
were
carried
into
the
library
and
tea
was
of
course
brought
to
them
the
american
senator
was
there
but
the
greetings
were
very
cold
morton
took
her
place
and
offered
her
hospitality
in
the
most
frigid
manner
there
had
not
been
the
smallest
spark
of
love
flame
shown
as
yet
nor
did
the
girl
as
she
sat
sipping
her
tea
seem
to
think
that
any
such
spark
was
wanted
morton
did
get
a
seat
beside
her
and
managed
to
take
away
her
muff
and
one
of
her
shawls
but
she
gave
them
to
him
almost
as
she
might
have
done
to
a
servant
she
smiled
indeed
but
she
smiled
as
some
women
smile
at
everybody
who
has
any
intercourse
with
them
i
think
perhaps
morton
will
let
us
go
said
lady
augustus
morton
immediately
rang
the
bell
and
prepared
to
precede
the
ladies
to
their
chambers
let
them
be
as
insolent
as
they
would
she
would
do
what
she
conceived
to
be
her
duty
then
lady
augustus
stalked
out
of
the
room
and
her
daughter
swum
after
her
they
do
seem
to
be
quite
the
same
as
they
were
in
washington
said
the
senator
john
morton
got
up
and
left
the
room
without
making
any
reply
he
was
thoroughly
unhappy
what
was
he
to
do
for
a
week
with
such
a
houseful
of
people
and
then
what
was
he
to
do
for
all
his
life
if
the
presiding
spirit
of
the
house
was
to
be
such
a
one
as
this
she
was
very
beautiful
certainly
so
he
told
himself
and
yet
as
he
walked
round
the
park
he
almost
repented
of
what
he
had
done
but
after
twenty
minutes
fast
walking
he
was
able
to
convince
himself
that
all
the
fault
on
this
occasion
lay
with
the
mother
lady
augustus
had
been
fatigued
with
her
journey
and
had
therefore
made
everybody
near
her
miserable
chapter
xiii
at
bragton
when
the
ladies
went
the
afternoon
was
not
half
over
and
they
did
not
dine
till
past
seven
as
morton
returned
to
the
house
in
the
dusk
he
thought
that
perhaps
arabella
might
make
some
attempt
to
throw
herself
in
his
way
she
had
often
done
so
when
they
were
not
engaged
and
surely
she
might
do
so
now
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
her
coming
down
to
the
library
when
she
had
got
rid
of
her
travelling
clothes
and
in
this
hope
he
looked
into
the
room
as
soon
as
the
door
was
open
the
senator
who
was
preparing
his
lecture
in
his
mind
at
once
asked
whether
no
one
in
england
had
an
apparatus
for
warming
rooms
such
as
was
to
be
found
in
every
house
in
the
states
the
paragon
hardly
vouchsafed
him
a
word
of
reply
but
escaped
trusting
that
he
might
meet
miss
trefoil
on
the
way
he
was
a
bold
man
and
even
ventured
to
knock
at
her
door
but
there
was
no
reply
and
fearing
the
senator
he
had
to
betake
himself
to
his
own
privacy
miss
trefoil
had
migrated
to
her
room
and
there
over
the
fire
was
holding
a
little
domestic
conversation
i
never
saw
such
a
barrack
in
my
life
said
lady
augustus
of
course
mamma
we
knew
that
we
should
find
the
house
such
as
it
was
left
a
hundred
years
ago
he
told
us
that
himself
he
should
have
put
something
in
it
to
make
it
at
any
rate
decent
before
we
came
in
what
the
use
if
he
to
live
always
at
foreign
courts
he
intends
to
come
home
sometimes
i
suppose
and
if
he
did
you
would
lady
augustus
was
not
going
to
let
her
daughter
marry
a
man
who
could
not
give
her
a
home
for
at
any
rate
a
part
of
the
year
of
course
he
must
furnish
the
place
and
have
an
immense
deal
done
before
he
can
marry
i
think
it
is
a
piece
of
impudence
to
bring
one
to
such
a
place
as
this
that
nonsense
mamma
because
he
told
us
all
about
it
the
more
i
see
of
it
all
arabella
the
more
sure
i
am
that
it
do
it
must
do
mamma
twelve
hundred
a
year
is
all
that
he
offers
and
his
lawyer
says
that
he
will
make
no
stipulation
whatever
as
to
an
allowance
really
mamma
you
might
leave
that
to
me
i
like
to
have
everything
fixed
my
dear
and
certain
nothing
really
ever
is
certain
while
there
is
anything
to
get
you
may
be
sure
that
i
shall
have
my
share
as
far
as
money
goes
i
not
a
bit
afraid
of
having
the
worst
of
it
only
there
will
be
so
very
little
between
us
that
just
it
there
no
doubt
about
the
property
mamma
a
nasty
beggarly
place
and
from
what
everybody
says
he
sure
to
be
a
minister
or
ambassador
or
something
of
that
sort
i
no
doubt
he
will
and
where
he
have
to
go
to
to
brazil
or
the
west
indies
or
some
british
colony
said
her
ladyship
showing
her
ignorance
of
the
foreign
office
service
that
might
be
very
well
you
could
stay
at
home
only
where
would
you
live
he
keep
a
house
in
town
for
you
is
this
the
sort
of
place
you
like
i
do
think
it
makes
any
difference
where
one
is
said
arabella
disgusted
but
i
do
a
very
great
difference
it
seems
to
me
that
altogether
under
the
control
of
that
hideous
old
termagant
arabella
i
think
you
better
make
up
your
mind
that
it
wo
do
it
must
do
said
arabella
you
very
fond
of
him
it
seems
mamma
how
you
do
delight
to
torture
me
as
if
my
life
were
bad
enough
without
your
making
it
worse
i
tell
you
my
dear
what
i
bound
to
tell
you
as
your
mother
i
have
my
duty
to
do
whether
it
painful
or
not
that
nonsense
mamma
you
know
it
is
that
might
have
been
all
very
well
ten
years
ago
you
were
almost
in
your
cradle
my
dear
psha
cradle
i
tell
you
what
it
is
mamma
i
been
at
it
till
i
nearly
broken
down
i
must
settle
somewhere
or
else
die
or
else
run
away
i
ca
stand
this
any
longer
and
i
wo
talk
of
work
men
work
what
man
ever
has
to
work
as
i
do
i
wonder
which
was
the
hardest
part
of
that
work
the
hairdressing
and
painting
and
companionship
of
the
lady
maid
or
the
continual
smiling
upon
unmarried
men
to
whom
she
had
nothing
to
say
and
for
whom
she
did
not
in
the
least
care
i
ca
do
it
any
more
and
i
wo
as
for
morton
i
do
care
that
for
him
you
know
i
do
i
never
cared
much
for
anybody
and
shall
never
again
care
at
all
you
find
that
will
come
all
right
after
you
are
married
like
you
and
papa
i
suppose
my
dear
i
had
no
mother
to
take
care
of
me
or
i
should
have
married
your
father
i
wish
you
had
because
then
i
should
be
going
to
marry
morton
but
as
i
have
got
so
far
for
heaven
sake
let
it
go
on
if
you
break
with
him
i
tell
him
everything
and
throw
myself
into
his
hands
lady
augustus
sighed
deeply
i
will
mamma
it
was
you
spotted
this
man
and
when
you
said
that
you
thought
it
would
do
i
gave
way
he
was
the
last
man
in
the
world
i
should
have
thought
of
myself
we
had
heard
so
much
about
bragton
and
bragton
is
here
the
estate
is
not
out
of
elbows
my
dear
my
opinion
is
that
we
made
a
mistake
he
not
the
sort
of
man
i
took
him
to
be
he
as
hard
as
a
file
leave
that
to
me
mamma
you
are
determined
then
i
think
i
am
at
any
rate
let
me
look
about
me
do
give
him
an
opportunity
of
breaking
off
till
i
have
made
up
my
mind
i
can
always
break
off
if
i
like
it
no
one
in
london
has
heard
of
the
engagement
yet
just
leave
me
alone
for
this
week
to
see
what
i
think
about
it
then
lady
augustus
threw
herself
back
in
her
chair
and
went
to
sleep
or
pretended
to
do
so
a
little
after
seven
she
and
her
daughter
dressed
for
dinner
went
down
to
the
library
together
the
other
guests
were
assembled
there
and
morton
was
already
plainly
expressing
her
anger
at
the
tardiness
of
her
son
guests
the
senator
had
got
hold
of
mainwaring
and
was
asking
pressing
questions
as
to
church
patronage
a
subject
not
very
agreeable
to
the
rector
of
john
as
his
living
had
been
bought
for
him
with
his
wife
money
during
the
incumbency
of
an
old
gentleman
of
cooper
who
was
himself
nearly
that
age
and
who
was
vicar
of
mallingham
a
parish
which
ran
into
dillsborough
and
comprehended
a
part
of
its
population
was
listening
to
these
queries
with
awe
and
perhaps
with
some
little
gratification
as
he
had
been
presented
to
his
living
by
the
bishop
after
a
curacy
of
many
years
this
kind
of
things
i
believe
can
be
bought
and
sold
in
the
market
said
the
senator
speaking
every
word
with
absolute
distinctness
but
as
he
paused
for
an
answer
the
two
ladies
came
in
and
the
conversation
was
changed
both
the
clergymen
were
introduced
to
lady
augustus
and
her
daughter
and
mainwaring
at
once
took
refuge
under
the
shadow
of
the
ladies
title
arabella
did
not
sit
down
so
that
morton
had
an
opportunity
of
standing
near
to
his
love
i
suppose
you
are
very
tired
he
said
not
in
the
least
she
smiled
her
sweetest
as
she
answered
him
but
yet
it
was
not
very
sweet
of
course
we
were
tired
and
cross
when
we
got
out
of
the
train
people
always
are
are
they
perhaps
ladies
are
we
were
but
all
that
about
the
carriages
morton
was
my
doing
mamma
had
been
talking
to
me
so
much
that
i
did
know
whether
i
was
on
my
head
or
my
heels
it
was
very
good
of
you
to
come
and
meet
us
and
i
ought
to
have
been
more
gracious
in
this
way
she
made
her
peace
and
as
she
was
quite
in
earnest
doing
a
portion
of
the
hard
work
of
her
life
she
continued
to
smile
as
sweetly
as
she
could
perhaps
he
liked
it
but
any
man
endowed
with
that
power
of
appreciation
which
we
call
sympathy
would
have
felt
it
to
be
as
cold
as
though
it
had
come
from
a
figure
on
a
glass
window
the
dinner
was
announced
morton
was
honoured
with
the
hand
of
lady
augustus
the
senator
handed
the
old
lady
into
the
and
mainwaring
the
younger
lady
so
that
arabella
was
sitting
next
to
her
lover
it
had
all
been
planned
by
morton
and
acceded
to
by
his
grandmother
gotobed
throughout
the
dinner
had
the
best
of
the
conversation
though
lady
augustus
had
power
enough
to
snub
him
on
more
than
one
occasion
suppose
we
were
to
allow
at
once
she
said
that
everything
is
better
in
the
united
states
than
anywhere
else
should
we
get
along
easier
i
do
know
that
getting
along
easy
is
what
we
have
particularly
got
in
view
said
gotobed
who
was
certainly
in
quest
of
information
but
it
is
what
i
have
in
view
gotobed
so
if
you
please
take
the
of
your
country
for
granted
then
she
turned
to
mainwaring
on
the
other
side
upon
this
the
senator
addressed
himself
for
a
while
to
the
table
at
large
and
had
soon
forgotten
altogether
the
expression
of
the
lady
wishes
i
believe
you
have
a
good
many
churches
about
here
said
lady
augustus
trying
to
make
conversation
to
her
neighbour
one
in
every
parish
i
fancy
said
mainwaring
who
preferred
all
subjects
to
clerical
subjects
i
suppose
london
is
quite
empty
now
we
came
direct
from
the
duke
said
lady
augustus
and
did
not
even
sleep
in
town
but
it
is
empty
the
duke
was
the
brother
of
lord
augustus
and
a
compromise
had
been
made
with
lady
augustus
by
which
she
and
her
daughter
should
be
allowed
a
fortnight
every
year
at
the
duke
place
in
the
country
and
a
certain
amount
of
entertainment
in
town
i
remember
the
duke
at
christchurch
said
the
parson
he
and
i
were
of
the
same
par
he
was
lord
mistletoe
then
dear
me
that
was
a
long
time
ago
i
wonder
whether
he
remembers
being
upset
out
of
a
trap
with
me
one
day
after
dinner
i
suppose
we
had
dined
in
earnest
he
has
gone
his
way
and
i
have
gone
mine
and
i
never
seen
him
since
pray
remember
me
to
him
lady
augustus
said
she
would
and
did
entertain
some
little
increased
respect
for
the
clergyman
who
could
boast
that
he
had
been
tipsy
in
company
with
her
worthy
poor
cooper
did
not
get
on
very
well
with
morton
all
his
remembrances
of
the
old
squire
were
eulogistic
and
affectionate
hers
were
just
the
reverse
he
had
a
good
word
to
say
for
reginald
morton
to
which
she
would
not
even
listen
she
was
willing
enough
to
ask
questions
about
the
mallingham
tenants
but
cooper
would
revert
back
to
the
old
days
and
so
conversation
was
at
an
end
morton
tried
to
make
himself
agreeable
to
his
neighbour
trying
also
very
hard
to
make
himself
believe
that
he
was
happy
in
his
immediate
position
how
often
in
the
various
amusements
of
the
world
is
one
tempted
to
pause
a
moment
and
ask
oneself
whether
one
really
likes
it
he
was
conscious
that
he
was
working
hard
struggling
to
be
happy
painfully
anxious
to
be
sure
that
he
was
enjoying
the
luxury
of
being
in
love
but
he
was
not
at
all
contented
there
she
was
and
very
beautiful
she
looked
and
he
thought
that
he
could
be
proud
of
her
if
she
sat
at
the
end
of
his
table
and
he
knew
that
she
was
engaged
to
be
his
wife
but
he
doubted
whether
she
was
in
love
with
him
and
he
almost
doubted
sometimes
whether
he
was
very
much
in
love
with
her
he
asked
her
in
so
many
words
what
he
should
do
to
amuse
her
would
she
like
to
ride
with
him
as
if
so
he
would
endeavour
to
get
would
she
like
to
go
out
hunting
would
she
be
taken
round
to
see
the
neighbouring
towns
rufford
and
norrington
lord
rufford
lives
somewhere
near
rufford
she
asked
yes
he
lived
at
rufford
hall
three
or
four
miles
from
the
town
did
lord
rufford
hunt
morton
believed
that
he
was
greatly
given
to
hunting
then
he
asked
arabella
whether
she
knew
the
young
lord
she
had
just
met
him
she
said
and
had
only
asked
the
question
because
of
the
name
he
is
one
of
my
neighbours
down
here
said
morton
but
being
always
away
of
course
i
see
nothing
of
him
after
that
arabella
consented
to
be
taken
out
on
horseback
to
see
a
meet
of
the
hounds
although
she
could
not
hunt
we
must
see
what
we
can
do
about
horses
he
said
she
however
professed
her
readiness
to
go
in
the
carriage
if
a
could
not
be
found
the
dinner
party
i
fear
was
very
dull
mainwaring
perhaps
liked
it
because
he
was
fond
of
dining
anywhere
away
from
home
cooper
was
glad
once
more
to
see
his
late
old
friend
old
gotobed
perhaps
obtained
some
information
but
otherwise
the
affair
was
dull
are
we
to
have
a
week
of
this
said
lady
augustus
when
she
found
herself
you
must
mamma
if
we
are
to
stay
till
we
go
to
the
gores
lord
rufford
is
here
in
the
neighbourhood
but
they
do
know
each
other
yes
they
do
slightly
i
am
to
go
to
the
meet
some
day
and
he
be
there
it
might
be
dangerous
nonsense
mamma
and
after
all
you
been
saying
about
dropping
mr
morton
but
there
is
nothing
so
bad
as
a
useless
flirtation
do
i
ever
flirt
oh
mamma
that
after
so
many
years
you
know
me
did
you
ever
see
me
yet
making
myself
happy
in
any
way
what
nonsense
you
talk
then
without
waiting
for
or
making
any
apology
she
walked
off
to
her
own
room
chapter
xiv
the
dillsborough
feud
it
that
nasty
beastly
drunken
club
said
masters
to
her
unfortunate
husband
on
the
wednesday
morning
it
may
perhaps
be
remembered
that
the
poisoned
fox
was
found
on
the
saturday
and
it
may
be
imagined
that
goarly
had
risen
in
importance
since
that
day
on
the
saturday
bean
with
a
couple
of
men
employed
by
lord
rufford
had
searched
the
wood
and
found
four
or
five
red
herrings
poisoned
with
strychnine
there
had
been
no
doubt
about
the
magnitude
of
the
offence
on
the
monday
a
detective
policeman
dressed
of
course
in
rustic
disguise
but
not
the
less
known
to
every
one
in
the
place
was
wandering
about
between
dillsborough
and
dillsborough
wood
and
making
futile
inquiries
as
to
the
purchase
of
strychnine
and
also
as
to
the
purchase
of
red
herrings
but
every
one
knew
and
such
leading
people
as
runciman
and
nupper
were
not
slow
to
declare
that
dillsborough
was
the
only
place
in
england
in
which
one
might
be
sure
that
those
articles
had
not
been
purchased
and
on
the
tuesday
it
began
to
be
understood
that
goarly
had
applied
to
bearside
the
other
attorney
in
reference
to
his
claim
against
lord
pheasants
he
had
contemptuously
refused
the
an
acre
offered
him
and
put
his
demand
at
as
to
the
poisoned
fox
and
the
herrings
and
the
strychnine
goarly
declared
that
he
did
care
if
there
were
twenty
detectives
in
the
place
he
stated
it
to
be
his
opinion
that
larry
twentyman
had
put
down
the
poison
it
was
all
very
well
goarly
said
for
larry
to
be
fond
of
gentlemen
and
to
ride
to
hounds
and
make
pretences
but
larry
liked
his
turkeys
as
well
as
anybody
else
and
larry
had
put
down
the
poison
in
this
matter
goarly
overreached
himself
no
one
in
dillsborough
could
be
brought
to
believe
that
even
harry
stubbings
was
ready
to
swear
that
he
should
suspect
himself
as
soon
but
nothing
was
clearer
than
this
that
goarly
was
going
to
make
a
stand
against
the
hunt
and
especially
against
lord
rufford
he
had
gone
to
bearside
and
bearside
had
taken
up
the
matter
in
a
serious
way
then
it
became
known
very
quickly
that
bearside
had
already
received
money
and
it
was
surmised
that
goarly
had
some
one
at
his
back
lord
rufford
had
lately
ejected
from
a
house
of
his
on
the
other
side
of
the
county
a
discontented
litigious
retired
grocer
from
rufford
who
had
made
some
money
and
had
set
himself
up
in
a
pretty
little
residence
with
a
few
acres
of
land
the
man
had
made
himself
objectionable
and
had
been
dispossessed
the
man
name
was
scrobby
and
hence
had
come
these
sorrows
this
was
the
story
that
had
already
made
itself
known
in
dillsborough
on
the
tuesday
evening
but
up
to
that
time
not
a
tittle
of
evidence
had
come
to
light
as
to
the
purchase
of
the
red
herrings
or
the
strychnine
all
that
was
known
was
the
fact
that
had
not
tony
tuppett
stopped
the
hounds
before
they
reached
the
wood
there
must
have
been
a
terrible
mortality
it
that
nasty
beastly
drunken
club
said
masters
to
her
husband
of
course
it
was
at
this
time
known
to
the
lady
that
her
husband
had
thrown
away
business
and
that
it
had
been
transferred
to
bearside
it
was
also
surmised
by
her
as
it
was
by
the
town
in
general
that
business
would
come
to
considerable
dimensions
just
the
sort
of
case
as
would
have
been
sure
to
bring
popularity
if
carried
through
as
nickem
the
senior
clerk
would
have
carried
it
and
as
soon
as
scrobby
name
was
heard
by
masters
there
was
no
end
to
the
money
in
the
lady
imagination
to
which
this
very
case
might
not
have
amounted
the
club
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
my
dear
what
time
did
you
come
home
on
saturday
night
or
sunday
morning
i
mean
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
you
did
settle
it
there
there
was
no
nastiness
and
no
beastliness
and
no
drunkenness
about
it
i
told
you
before
i
went
that
i
would
take
it
no
you
did
how
on
earth
are
you
to
go
on
if
you
chuck
the
children
bread
out
of
their
mouths
in
that
way
you
wo
believe
me
do
you
ask
twentyman
what
sort
of
a
man
goarly
is
the
attorney
knew
that
larry
was
in
great
favour
with
his
wife
as
being
the
favoured
suitor
for
mary
hand
and
had
thought
that
this
argument
would
be
very
strong
i
do
want
twentyman
to
teach
me
what
is
proper
for
my
family
nor
yet
to
teach
you
your
business
twentyman
has
his
own
way
of
living
he
brought
home
kate
the
other
day
with
hardly
a
rag
of
her
sister
habit
left
she
do
go
out
hunting
any
more
very
well
my
dear
indeed
for
the
matter
of
that
i
do
see
how
any
of
them
are
to
do
anything
what
lord
rufford
do
for
you
i
do
want
lord
rufford
to
do
anything
for
me
the
attorney
was
beginning
to
have
his
spirit
stirred
within
him
you
do
want
anybody
to
do
anything
and
yet
you
will
do
nothing
yourself
just
because
a
set
of
drinking
fellows
in
a
which
you
call
a
club
it
is
a
it
worse
because
nobody
can
see
what
you
doing
i
know
how
it
was
you
had
the
pluck
to
hold
to
your
own
when
runciman
told
you
not
there
was
a
spice
of
truth
in
this
which
made
it
all
the
more
bitter
runciman
knows
on
which
side
his
bread
is
buttered
he
can
make
his
money
out
of
these
fellows
he
can
send
in
his
bills
and
get
them
paid
too
and
it
all
very
well
for
larry
twentyman
to
be
hobbing
and
nobbing
with
the
likes
of
them
botseys
but
for
a
father
of
a
family
like
you
to
be
put
off
his
business
by
what
runciman
says
is
a
shame
i
shall
manage
my
business
as
i
think
fit
said
the
attorney
and
when
we
all
in
the
what
you
do
then
said
masters
with
her
handkerchief
out
at
the
spur
of
the
moment
whenever
she
roused
her
husband
to
a
state
of
bellicose
ire
by
her
taunts
she
could
always
reduce
him
again
by
her
tears
being
well
aware
of
this
he
would
bear
the
taunts
as
long
as
he
could
knowing
that
the
tears
would
be
still
worse
he
was
so
that
when
she
affected
to
be
miserable
he
could
not
maintain
the
sternness
of
his
demeanour
and
leave
her
in
her
misery
when
everything
has
gone
away
from
us
what
are
we
to
do
my
little
bit
of
money
has
disappeared
ever
so
long
then
she
sat
herself
down
in
her
chair
and
had
a
great
cry
it
was
useless
for
him
to
remind
her
that
hitherto
she
had
never
wanted
anything
for
herself
or
her
children
she
was
resolved
that
everything
was
going
to
the
dogs
because
goarly
case
had
been
refused
and
what
will
all
those
sporting
men
do
for
you
she
repeated
i
hate
the
very
name
of
a
gentleman
so
i
do
i
wish
goarly
had
killed
all
the
foxes
in
the
county
nasty
vermin
what
good
are
the
likes
of
them
nickem
the
senior
clerk
was
at
first
made
almost
as
unhappy
as
masters
by
the
weak
decision
to
which
his
employer
had
come
and
had
in
the
first
flush
of
his
anger
resolved
to
leave
the
office
he
was
sure
that
the
case
was
one
which
would
just
have
suited
him
he
would
have
got
up
the
evidence
as
to
the
fertility
of
the
land
the
enormous
promise
of
crop
and
the
ultimate
absolute
barrenness
to
a
marvel
he
would
have
proved
clouds
of
pheasants
and
then
humble
position
futile
industry
and
general
poverty
might
have
been
contrasted
beautifully
with
lord
rufford
wealth
idleness
and
devotion
to
sport
anything
above
the
an
acre
obtained
against
the
lord
would
have
been
a
triumph
and
he
thought
that
if
the
thing
had
been
well
managed
they
might
probably
have
got
and
then
in
such
a
case
lord
rufford
could
hardly
have
taxed
the
costs
it
was
really
suicide
for
an
attorney
to
throw
away
business
so
excellent
as
this
and
now
it
had
gone
to
bearside
whom
nickem
remembered
as
a
junior
to
himself
when
they
were
both
young
hobbledehoys
at
norrington
a
dirty
boy
who
was
suspected
of
purloining
halfpence
out
of
the
thing
was
very
trying
to
nat
nickem
but
suddenly
before
that
wednesday
was
over
another
idea
had
occurred
to
him
and
he
was
almost
content
he
knew
goarly
and
he
had
heard
of
scrobby
and
scrobby
history
in
regard
to
the
tenement
at
rufford
as
he
could
not
get
goarly
case
why
should
he
not
make
something
of
the
case
against
goarly
that
detective
was
merely
eking
out
his
time
and
having
an
idle
week
among
the
if
he
could
set
himself
up
as
an
amateur
detective
he
thought
that
he
might
perhaps
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
all
it
is
not
a
bad
thing
to
be
concerned
on
the
same
side
with
a
lord
when
the
lord
is
in
earnest
lord
rufford
was
very
angry
about
the
poison
in
the
covert
and
would
probably
be
ready
to
pay
very
handsomely
for
having
the
criminal
found
and
punished
the
criminal
of
course
was
goarly
nickem
did
not
doubt
that
for
a
moment
and
would
not
have
doubted
it
whichever
side
he
might
have
taken
nickem
did
not
suppose
that
any
one
for
a
moment
really
doubted
goarly
guilt
but
to
his
eyes
such
certainty
amounted
to
nothing
if
evidence
of
the
crime
were
not
forthcoming
he
probably
felt
within
his
own
bosom
that
the
last
judgment
of
all
would
depend
in
some
way
on
terrestrial
evidence
and
was
quite
sure
that
it
was
by
such
that
a
man
conscience
should
be
affected
if
goarly
had
so
done
the
deed
as
to
be
beyond
the
possibility
of
detection
nickem
could
not
have
brought
himself
to
regard
goarly
as
a
sinner
as
it
was
he
had
considerable
respect
for
goarly
but
might
it
not
be
possible
to
drop
down
upon
scrobby
bearside
with
his
case
against
the
lord
would
be
nowhere
if
goarly
could
be
got
to
own
that
he
had
been
suborned
by
scrobby
to
put
down
the
poison
or
if
in
default
of
this
any
close
communication
could
be
proved
between
goarly
and
scrobby
scrobby
injury
and
spirit
of
revenge
being
patent
then
too
bearside
would
not
have
much
of
a
case
a
jury
would
look
at
that
question
of
damages
with
a
very
different
eye
if
scrobby
spirit
of
revenge
could
be
proved
at
the
trial
and
also
the
poisoning
and
also
machinations
between
scrobby
and
goarly
nickem
was
a
little
man
about
forty
who
wrote
a
good
flourishing
hand
could
endure
an
immense
amount
of
work
and
drink
a
large
amount
of
alcohol
without
being
drunk
his
nose
and
face
were
all
over
blotches
and
he
looked
to
be
dissipated
and
disreputable
but
as
he
often
boasted
no
one
could
say
that
black
was
the
white
of
his
eye
by
which
he
meant
to
insinuate
that
he
had
not
been
detected
in
anything
dishonest
and
that
he
was
never
too
tipsy
to
do
his
work
he
was
a
married
man
and
did
not
keep
his
wife
and
children
in
absolute
comfort
but
they
lived
and
nickem
in
some
fashion
paid
his
way
there
was
another
clerk
in
the
office
a
very
much
younger
man
named
sundown
and
nickem
could
not
make
his
proposition
to
masters
till
sundown
had
left
the
office
nickem
himself
had
only
matured
his
plans
at
dinner
time
and
was
obliged
to
be
reticent
till
at
six
sundown
took
himself
off
masters
was
at
the
moment
locking
his
own
desk
when
nickem
winked
at
him
to
stay
masters
did
stay
and
sundown
did
at
last
leave
the
office
you
could
let
me
leave
home
for
three
days
said
nickem
there
ai
much
a
doing
what
do
you
want
it
for
that
goarly
is
a
great
blackguard
mr
masters
very
likely
do
you
know
anything
about
him
nickem
scratched
his
head
and
rubbed
his
chin
i
think
i
could
manage
to
know
something
in
what
way
i
do
think
i
quite
prepared
to
say
sir
i
should
use
your
name
of
course
but
they
down
upon
lord
rufford
and
if
you
could
lend
me
a
trifle
of
sir
i
think
i
could
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
his
lordship
would
be
awful
obliged
to
any
one
who
could
hit
it
off
masters
did
give
his
clerk
leave
for
three
days
and
did
advance
him
the
required
money
and
when
he
suggested
in
a
whisper
that
perhaps
the
circumstance
need
not
be
mentioned
to
masters
nickem
winked
again
and
put
his
to
the
side
of
his
big
carbuncled
nose
that
evening
larry
twentyman
came
in
but
was
not
received
with
any
great
favour
by
masters
there
was
growing
up
at
this
moment
in
dillsborough
the
bitterness
of
real
warfare
between
the
friends
and
enemies
of
sport
in
general
and
masters
was
ranking
herself
thereby
among
the
enemies
larry
was
of
course
one
of
the
friends
but
unhappily
there
was
a
slight
difference
of
sentiment
even
in
larry
own
house
and
on
this
very
morning
old
twentyman
had
expressed
to
masters
a
feeling
of
wrong
which
had
gradually
risen
from
the
annual
demolition
of
her
pet
broods
of
turkeys
she
declared
that
for
the
last
three
years
every
turkey
poult
had
gone
and
that
at
last
she
was
beginning
to
feel
it
it
over
a
hundred
of
they
had
and
it
is
wearing
said
the
old
woman
larry
had
twenty
times
begged
her
to
give
up
the
rearing
turkeys
but
her
heart
had
been
too
high
for
that
i
do
know
why
lord
rufford
foxes
are
to
be
thought
of
always
and
nobody
is
to
think
about
your
poor
mother
poultry
said
masters
lugging
the
subject
in
neck
and
heels
has
she
been
talking
to
you
masters
about
her
turkeys
your
mother
may
speak
to
me
i
suppose
if
she
likes
it
without
offence
to
lord
rufford
lord
rufford
has
got
nothing
to
do
with
it
the
wood
belongs
to
him
said
masters
foxes
are
much
better
than
turkeys
anyway
said
kate
masters
if
you
do
hold
your
tongue
miss
you
be
sent
to
bed
the
wood
belongs
to
his
lordship
and
the
foxes
are
a
nuisance
he
keeps
the
foxes
for
the
county
and
where
would
the
county
be
without
them
began
larry
what
is
it
brings
money
into
such
a
place
as
this
to
runciman
stables
and
harry
stubbings
and
the
like
of
them
what
money
does
it
bring
in
to
steady
honest
people
look
at
all
the
grooms
said
larry
the
impudentest
set
of
young
vipers
about
the
place
said
the
lady
look
at
grice
business
grice
was
the
saddler
grice
indeed
what
grice
and
the
price
of
horses
yes
making
everything
dear
that
ought
to
be
cheap
i
do
see
and
i
never
shall
see
and
i
never
will
see
any
good
in
extravagant
idleness
as
for
kate
she
shall
never
go
out
hunting
again
she
has
torn
mary
habit
to
pieces
and
shooting
is
worse
why
is
a
man
to
have
a
flock
of
voracious
cormorants
come
down
upon
his
corn
fields
i
all
in
favour
of
goarly
and
so
i
tell
you
mr
twentyman
after
this
poor
larry
went
away
finding
that
he
had
no
opportunity
for
saying
a
word
to
mary
masters
chapter
xv
a
fit
companion
for
me
and
my
sisters
on
that
same
wednesday
reginald
morton
had
called
at
the
house
had
asked
for
miss
masters
and
had
found
her
alone
masters
at
the
time
had
been
out
picking
up
intelligence
about
the
great
case
and
the
two
younger
girls
had
been
at
school
reginald
as
he
walked
home
from
bragton
all
alone
on
that
occasion
when
larry
had
returned
with
mary
was
quite
sure
that
he
would
never
willingly
go
into
mary
presence
again
why
should
he
disturb
his
mind
about
such
a
girl
one
who
could
rush
into
the
arms
of
such
a
man
as
larry
twentyman
or
indeed
why
disturb
his
mind
about
any
girl
that
was
not
the
manner
of
life
which
he
planned
for
himself
after
that
he
shut
himself
up
for
a
few
days
and
was
not
much
seen
by
any
of
the
dillsborough
folk
but
on
this
wednesday
he
received
a
letter
and
as
he
told
himself
merely
in
consequence
of
that
letter
he
called
at
the
attorney
house
and
asked
for
miss
masters
he
was
shown
up
into
the
beautiful
and
in
a
few
minutes
mary
came
to
him
i
have
brought
you
a
letter
from
my
aunt
he
said
from
lady
ushant
i
am
so
glad
she
was
writing
to
me
and
she
put
this
under
cover
i
know
what
it
contains
she
wants
you
to
go
to
her
at
cheltenham
for
a
month
oh
mr
morton
would
you
like
to
go
how
should
i
not
like
to
go
lady
ushant
is
my
dearest
dearest
friend
it
is
so
very
good
of
her
to
think
of
me
she
talks
of
the
first
week
in
december
and
wants
you
to
be
there
for
christmas
i
do
at
all
know
that
i
can
go
mr
morton
why
not
go
i
afraid
mamma
will
not
spare
me
there
were
many
reasons
she
could
hardly
go
on
such
a
visit
without
some
renewal
of
her
scanty
wardrobe
which
perhaps
the
family
funds
would
not
permit
and
as
she
knew
very
well
masters
was
not
at
all
favourable
to
lady
ushant
if
the
old
lady
had
altogether
kept
mary
it
might
have
been
very
well
but
she
had
not
done
so
and
masters
had
more
than
once
said
that
that
kind
of
thing
must
be
all
over
meaning
that
mary
was
to
drop
her
intimacy
with
people
that
were
of
no
real
use
and
then
there
was
twentyman
and
his
suit
mary
had
for
some
time
felt
that
her
intended
her
to
understand
that
her
only
escape
from
home
would
be
by
becoming
twentyman
i
do
think
it
will
be
possible
mr
morton
my
aunt
will
be
very
sorry
oh
how
sorry
shall
i
be
it
is
like
having
another
little
bit
of
heaven
before
me
then
he
said
what
he
certainly
should
not
have
said
i
thought
miss
masters
that
your
heaven
was
all
here
what
do
you
mean
by
that
mr
morton
she
asked
blushing
up
to
her
hair
of
course
she
knew
what
he
meant
and
of
course
she
was
angry
with
him
ever
since
that
walk
her
mind
had
been
troubled
by
ideas
as
to
what
he
would
think
about
her
and
now
he
was
telling
her
what
he
thought
i
fancied
that
you
were
happy
here
without
going
to
see
an
old
woman
who
after
all
has
not
much
amusement
to
offer
to
you
i
do
want
any
amusement
at
any
rate
you
will
answer
lady
ushant
of
course
i
shall
answer
her
perhaps
you
can
let
me
know
she
wishes
me
to
take
you
to
cheltenham
i
shall
go
for
a
couple
of
days
but
i
shall
not
stay
longer
if
you
are
going
perhaps
you
would
allow
me
to
travel
with
you
of
course
it
would
be
very
kind
but
i
do
suppose
that
i
shall
go
i
am
sure
lady
ushant
wo
believe
that
i
am
kept
away
from
her
by
any
pleasure
of
my
own
here
i
can
explain
it
all
to
her
and
she
will
understand
me
she
hardly
meant
to
reproach
him
she
did
not
mean
to
assume
an
intimacy
sufficient
for
reproach
but
he
felt
that
she
had
reproached
him
i
love
lady
ushant
so
dearly
that
i
would
go
anywhere
to
see
her
if
i
could
then
i
think
it
could
be
managed
your
father
papa
does
not
attend
much
to
us
girls
it
is
mamma
that
manages
all
that
at
any
rate
i
will
write
to
lady
ushant
and
will
ask
papa
to
let
you
know
then
it
seemed
as
though
there
were
nothing
else
for
him
but
to
go
and
yet
he
wanted
to
say
some
other
word
if
he
had
been
cruel
in
throwing
twentyman
in
her
teeth
surely
he
ought
to
apologize
i
did
not
mean
to
say
anything
to
offend
you
you
have
not
offended
me
at
all
mr
morton
if
i
did
think
that
that
it
does
not
signify
in
the
least
i
only
want
lady
ushant
to
understand
that
if
i
could
possibly
go
to
her
i
would
rather
do
that
than
anything
else
in
the
world
because
lady
ushant
is
kind
to
me
i
need
expect
other
people
to
be
so
reginald
morton
was
of
course
the
other
people
then
he
paused
a
moment
i
did
so
long
he
said
to
walk
round
the
old
place
with
you
the
other
day
before
these
people
came
there
and
i
was
so
disappointed
when
you
would
not
come
with
me
i
was
coming
but
you
went
back
with
that
other
man
of
course
i
did
when
you
showed
so
plainly
that
you
did
want
him
to
join
you
what
was
i
to
do
i
could
send
him
away
twentyman
is
a
very
intimate
friend
of
ours
and
very
kind
to
dolly
and
kate
i
wished
so
much
to
talk
to
you
about
the
old
days
and
i
wish
to
go
to
your
aunt
morton
but
we
ca
all
of
us
have
what
we
wish
of
course
i
saw
that
you
were
very
angry
but
i
could
help
that
perhaps
it
was
wrong
in
twentyman
to
offer
to
walk
with
you
i
did
say
so
at
all
you
looked
it
at
any
rate
morton
and
as
twentyman
is
a
friend
of
ours
you
were
angry
with
me
i
do
say
that
but
as
you
were
too
grand
for
our
friend
of
course
you
were
too
grand
for
us
that
is
a
very
unkind
way
of
putting
it
i
do
think
i
am
grand
a
man
may
wish
to
have
a
little
conversation
with
a
very
old
friend
without
being
interrupted
and
yet
not
be
grand
i
dare
say
twentyman
is
just
as
good
as
i
am
you
do
think
that
mr
morton
i
believe
him
to
be
a
great
deal
better
for
he
earns
his
bread
and
takes
care
of
his
mother
and
as
far
as
i
know
does
his
duty
thoroughly
i
know
the
difference
morton
and
of
course
i
know
how
you
feel
it
i
do
suppose
that
twentyman
is
a
fit
companion
for
any
of
the
mortons
but
for
all
that
he
may
be
a
fit
companion
for
me
and
my
sisters
surely
she
must
have
said
this
with
the
express
object
of
declaring
to
him
that
in
spite
of
the
advantages
of
her
education
she
chose
to
put
herself
in
the
ranks
of
the
twentymans
runcimans
and
such
like
he
had
come
there
ardently
wishing
that
she
might
be
allowed
to
go
to
his
aunt
and
resolved
that
he
would
take
her
himself
if
it
were
possible
but
now
he
almost
thought
that
she
had
better
not
go
if
she
had
made
her
election
she
must
be
allowed
to
abide
by
it
if
she
meant
to
marry
twentyman
what
good
could
she
get
by
associating
with
his
aunt
or
with
him
and
had
she
not
as
good
as
told
him
that
she
meant
to
marry
twentyman
she
had
at
any
rate
very
plainly
declared
that
she
regarded
twentyman
as
her
equal
in
rank
then
he
took
his
leave
without
any
further
explanation
even
if
she
did
go
to
cheltenham
he
would
not
take
her
after
that
he
walked
straight
out
to
bragton
he
was
of
course
altogether
unconscious
what
grand
things
his
cousin
john
had
intended
to
do
by
him
had
not
the
honourable
old
lady
interfered
but
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
duty
required
him
to
call
at
the
house
so
he
walked
by
the
path
across
the
bridge
and
when
he
came
out
on
the
gravel
road
near
the
front
door
he
found
a
gentleman
smoking
a
cigar
and
looking
around
him
it
was
gotobed
who
had
just
returned
from
a
visit
which
he
had
made
the
circumstances
of
which
must
be
narrated
in
the
next
chapter
the
senator
lifted
his
hat
and
remarked
that
it
was
a
very
fine
afternoon
reginald
lifted
his
hat
and
assented
morton
sir
i
think
is
out
with
the
ladies
taking
a
drive
i
will
leave
a
card
then
the
old
lady
is
at
home
sir
if
you
wish
to
see
her
continued
the
senator
following
reginald
up
to
the
door
oh
reginald
is
that
you
said
old
hopkins
taking
the
card
they
are
all
out
except
herself
as
he
certainly
did
not
wish
to
see
herself
he
greeted
the
old
woman
and
left
his
card
you
live
in
these
parts
sir
asked
the
senator
in
the
town
yonder
because
morton
housekeeper
seems
to
know
you
she
knows
me
very
well
as
i
was
brought
up
in
this
house
good
morning
to
you
good
afternoon
to
you
sir
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
who
lives
in
that
country
residence
what
you
call
a
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
reginald
said
that
he
presumed
the
gentleman
was
alluding
to
twentyman
house
ah
yes
i
dare
say
that
was
the
name
i
heard
up
there
you
are
not
twentyman
sir
my
name
is
morton
morton
is
it
perhaps
my
friend
ah
ah
yes
he
did
like
to
say
uncle
because
reginald
did
look
old
enough
and
he
knew
he
ought
not
to
say
brother
because
the
elder
brother
in
england
would
certainly
have
had
the
property
i
am
john
morton
cousin
oh
morton
cousin
i
asked
whether
you
were
the
owner
of
that
because
i
intruded
just
now
by
passing
through
the
yards
and
i
would
have
apologized
good
afternoon
to
you
sir
then
reginald
having
thus
done
his
duty
returned
home
mary
masters
when
she
was
alone
was
again
very
angry
with
herself
she
knew
thoroughly
how
perverse
she
had
been
when
she
declared
that
larry
twentyman
was
a
fit
companion
for
herself
and
that
she
had
said
it
on
purpose
to
punish
the
man
who
was
talking
to
her
not
a
day
passed
or
hardly
an
hour
of
a
day
in
which
she
did
not
tell
herself
that
the
education
she
had
received
and
the
early
associations
of
her
life
had
made
her
unfit
for
the
marriage
which
her
friends
were
urging
upon
her
it
was
the
one
great
sorrow
of
her
life
she
even
repented
of
the
good
things
of
her
early
days
because
they
had
given
her
a
distaste
for
what
might
have
otherwise
been
happiness
and
good
fortune
there
had
been
moments
in
which
she
had
told
herself
that
she
ought
to
marry
larry
twentyman
and
adapt
herself
to
the
surroundings
of
her
life
since
she
had
seen
reginald
morton
frequently
she
had
been
less
prone
to
tell
herself
so
than
before
and
yet
to
this
very
man
she
had
declared
her
fitness
for
larry
companionship
chapter

gotobed
philanthropy
gotobed
when
the
persecutions
of
goarly
were
described
to
him
at
the
scene
of
the
dead
fox
had
expressed
considerable
admiration
for
the
man
character
as
portrayed
by
what
he
then
heard
the
man
a
poor
man
too
and
despised
in
the
land
was
standing
up
for
his
rights
all
alone
against
the
aristocracy
and
plutocracy
of
the
county
he
had
killed
the
demon
whom
the
aristocracy
and
plutocracy
worshipped
and
had
appeared
there
in
arms
ready
to
defend
his
own
territory
one
against
so
many
and
so
poor
a
man
against
men
so
rich
the
senator
had
at
once
said
that
he
would
call
upon
goarly
and
the
senator
was
a
man
who
always
carried
out
his
purposes
afterwards
from
john
morton
and
from
others
who
knew
the
country
better
than
morton
he
learned
further
particulars
on
the
monday
and
tuesday
he
fathomed
or
nearly
fathomed
that
matter
of
the
an
acre
he
learned
at
any
rate
that
the
owner
of
the
wood
admitted
a
damage
done
by
him
to
the
corn
and
had
then
himself
assessed
the
damage
without
consultation
with
the
injured
party
and
he
was
informed
also
that
goarly
was
going
to
law
with
the
lord
for
a
fuller
compensation
he
liked
goarly
for
killing
the
fox
and
he
liked
him
more
for
going
to
law
with
lord
rufford
he
declared
openly
at
bragton
his
sympathy
with
the
man
and
his
intention
of
expressing
it
morton
was
annoyed
and
endeavoured
to
persuade
him
to
leave
the
man
alone
but
in
vain
no
doubt
had
he
expressed
himself
decisively
and
told
his
friend
that
he
should
be
annoyed
by
a
guest
from
his
house
taking
part
in
such
a
matter
the
senator
would
have
abstained
and
would
merely
have
made
one
more
note
as
to
english
peculiarities
and
english
ideas
of
justice
but
morton
could
not
bring
himself
to
do
this
the
feeling
of
the
country
will
be
altogether
against
you
he
had
said
hoping
to
deter
the
senator
the
senator
had
replied
that
though
the
feeling
of
that
little
bit
of
the
country
might
be
against
him
he
did
not
believe
that
such
would
be
the
case
with
the
feeling
of
england
generally
the
ladies
had
all
become
a
little
afraid
of
gotobed
and
hardly
dared
to
express
an
opinion
lady
augustus
did
say
that
she
supposed
that
goarly
was
a
low
vulgar
fellow
which
of
course
strengthened
the
senator
in
his
purpose
the
senator
on
wednesday
would
not
wait
for
lunch
but
started
a
little
before
one
with
a
crust
of
bread
in
his
pocket
to
find
his
way
to
goarly
house
there
was
no
difficulty
in
this
as
he
could
see
the
wood
as
soon
as
he
had
got
upon
the
high
road
he
found
twentyman
gate
and
followed
directly
the
route
which
the
hunting
party
had
taken
till
he
came
to
the
spot
on
which
the
crowd
had
been
assembled
close
to
this
there
was
a
leading
into
dillsborough
wood
and
standing
in
the
gateway
was
a
man
the
senator
thought
that
this
might
not
improbably
be
goarly
himself
and
asked
the
question
might
your
name
be
goarly
sir
me
goarly
said
the
man
in
infinite
disgust
i
ai
nothing
of
the
kind
and
you
knows
it
that
the
man
should
have
been
annoyed
at
being
taken
for
goarly
that
man
being
bean
the
gamekeeper
who
would
willingly
have
hung
goarly
if
he
could
and
would
have
thought
it
quite
proper
that
a
law
should
be
now
passed
for
hanging
him
at
once
was
natural
enough
but
why
he
should
have
told
the
senator
that
the
senator
knew
he
was
not
goarly
it
might
be
difficult
to
explain
he
probably
at
once
regarded
the
senator
as
an
enemy
as
a
man
on
the
other
side
and
therefore
as
a
cunning
knave
who
would
be
sure
to
come
creeping
about
on
false
pretences
bean
who
had
already
heard
of
bearside
and
had
heard
of
scrobby
in
connection
with
this
matter
looked
at
the
senator
very
hard
he
knew
bearside
the
man
certainly
was
not
the
attorney
and
from
what
he
had
heard
of
scrobby
he
did
think
he
was
scrobby
the
man
was
not
like
what
in
his
imagination
scrobby
would
be
he
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
gotobed
who
was
a
person
of
an
imposing
appearance
tall
and
thin
with
a
long
nose
and
look
of
great
acuteness
dressed
in
black
from
head
to
foot
but
yet
not
looking
quite
like
an
english
gentleman
he
was
a
man
to
whom
bean
in
an
ordinary
way
would
have
been
civil
civil
in
a
cold
guarded
way
but
how
was
he
to
be
civil
to
anybody
who
addressed
him
as
goarly
i
did
not
know
it
said
the
senator
as
goarly
lives
near
here
i
thought
you
might
be
goarly
when
i
saw
goarly
he
had
a
gun
and
you
have
a
gun
can
you
tell
me
where
goarly
lives
tother
side
of
the
wood
said
bean
pointing
back
with
his
thumb
he
never
had
a
gun
like
this
in
his
hand
in
all
his
born
days
i
dare
say
not
my
friend
i
can
go
through
the
wood
i
guess
for
bean
had
pointed
exactly
over
the
gateway
i
guess
you
ca
then
said
bean
the
man
who
like
other
gamekeepers
lived
much
in
the
company
of
gentlemen
was
ordinarily
a
civil
courteous
fellow
who
knew
how
to
smile
and
make
things
pleasant
but
at
this
moment
he
was
very
much
put
out
his
covert
had
been
found
full
of
red
herrings
and
strychnine
and
his
fox
had
been
poisoned
he
had
lost
his
guinea
on
the
day
of
the
hunt
the
guinea
which
would
have
been
his
perquisite
had
they
found
a
live
fox
in
his
wood
and
all
this
was
being
done
by
such
a
fellow
as
goarly
and
now
this
abandoned
wretch
was
bringing
an
action
against
his
lordship
and
was
leagued
with
such
men
as
scrobby
and
bearside
it
was
a
dreadful
state
of
things
how
was
it
likely
that
he
should
give
a
passage
through
the
wood
to
anybody
coming
after
goarly
you
on
twentyman
land
now
as
i
dare
say
you
know
i
do
know
anything
about
it
well
that
wood
is
lord
rufford
wood
i
did
know
as
much
as
that
certainly
and
you
ca
go
into
it
how
shall
i
find
goarly
house
if
you
get
over
that
there
ditch
you
be
on
mister
land
and
that
all
about
it
bean
as
he
said
this
put
a
strongly
ironical
emphasis
on
the
term
of
respect
and
then
turned
back
into
the
wood
the
senator
made
his
way
down
the
fence
to
the
bank
on
which
goarly
had
stood
with
his
gun
then
over
into
goarly
field
and
so
round
the
back
of
the
wood
till
he
saw
a
small
red
brick
house
standing
perhaps
four
hundred
yards
from
the
covert
just
on
the
elbow
of
a
lane
it
was
a
place
with
a
pigsty
and
a
and
a
small
or
all
close
around
it
the
stack
of
chimneys
seemed
to
threaten
to
fall
and
as
he
approached
from
behind
he
could
see
that
the
two
windows
opening
that
way
were
stuffed
with
rags
there
was
a
little
cabbage
garden
which
now
seemed
to
be
all
stalks
and
a
single
goose
waddling
about
the
the
senator
went
to
the
door
and
having
knocked
was
investigated
by
a
woman
from
behind
it
yes
this
was
goarly
house
what
did
the
gentleman
want
goarly
was
at
work
in
the
field
then
she
came
out
the
senator
having
signified
his
friendly
intentions
and
summoned
goarly
to
the
spot
i
hope
i
see
you
well
sir
said
the
senator
putting
out
his
hand
as
goarly
came
up
dragging
a
behind
him
goarly
rubbed
his
hand
on
his
breeches
before
he
gave
it
to
be
shaken
and
declared
himself
to
be
pretty
tidy
considering
i
was
present
the
other
day
goarly
when
that
dead
fox
was
exposed
to
view
was
you
sir
i
was
given
to
understand
that
you
had
destroyed
the
brute
do
you
believe
a
word
on
it
then
said
the
woman
interposing
he
did
do
nothing
of
the
kind
who
ever
seed
him
a
buying
of
red
herrings
and
hold
your
jaw
said
goarly
familiarly
let
prove
it
i
know
who
you
are
sir
but
let
prove
it
my
name
goarly
is
elias
gotobed
i
am
an
american
citizen
and
senator
for
the
state
of
mickewa
and
goarly
shook
their
heads
at
every
separate
item
of
information
tendered
to
them
i
am
on
a
visit
to
this
country
and
am
at
present
staying
at
the
house
of
my
friend
john
morton
he
the
from
bragton
dan
hold
your
jaw
ca
you
said
the
husband
then
he
touched
his
hat
to
the
senator
intending
to
signify
that
the
senator
might
if
he
pleased
continue
his
narrative
if
you
did
kill
that
fox
goarly
i
think
you
were
quite
right
to
kill
him
then
goarly
winked
at
him
i
can
not
imagine
that
even
the
laws
of
england
could
justify
a
man
in
perpetuating
a
breed
of
wild
animals
that
are
destructive
to
his
neighbours
property
i
could
shoot
not
a
doubt
about
that
mister
i
could
shoot
and
i
wull
have
a
care
dan
whispered
goarly
hold
your
jaw
will
ye
i
could
shoot
mister
i
do
rightly
know
about
that
fox
we
saw
was
poisoned
i
suppose
said
the
senator
carelessly
have
a
care
dan
have
a
care
whispered
the
wife
allow
me
to
assure
both
of
you
said
the
senator
that
you
need
fear
nothing
from
me
i
have
come
quite
as
a
friend
thank
sir
said
goarly
again
touching
his
hat
it
seems
to
me
said
the
senator
that
in
this
matter
a
great
many
men
are
leagued
together
against
you
you
may
say
that
sir
i
did
just
catch
your
name
sir
my
name
is
gotobed
gotobed
elias
gotobed
senator
from
the
state
of
mickewa
to
the
united
states
congress
goarly
who
understood
nothing
of
all
these
titles
and
who
had
all
along
doubted
dropped
a
suspicious
curtsey
goarly
who
understood
a
little
now
took
his
hat
altogether
off
he
was
very
much
puzzled
but
inclined
to
think
that
if
he
managed
matters
rightly
profit
might
be
got
out
of
this
very
strange
meeting
in
my
country
goarly
all
men
are
free
and
equal
that
a
fine
thing
sir
it
is
a
fine
thing
my
friend
if
properly
understood
and
properly
used
coming
from
such
a
country
i
was
shocked
to
see
so
many
rich
men
banded
together
against
one
who
i
suppose
is
not
rich
very
far
from
it
said
the
woman
it
my
own
land
you
know
said
goarly
who
was
proud
of
his
position
as
a
landowner
no
one
ca
touch
me
on
it
as
long
as
the
rates
is
paid
i
as
good
a
man
here
and
he
stamped
his
foot
on
the
ground
as
his
lordship
is
in
that
there
wood
this
was
the
first
word
spoken
by
the
goarlys
that
had
pleased
the
senator
and
this
set
him
off
again
just
so
and
i
admire
a
man
that
will
stand
up
for
his
own
rights
i
am
told
that
you
have
found
his
lordship
pheasants
destructive
to
your
corn
did
leave
him
hardly
a
grain
last
august
said
goarly
will

the

her

mr
gotobed

a
poor
man
for
what
harm

look
at
that
there
goose
gotobed
did
look
at
the
goose
there
nine
and
twenty
they
tuk
from
me
and
only
left
un
that
now
goarly
goose
was
well
known
in
those
parts
it
was
declared
that
she
was
more
than
a
match
for
any
fox
in
the
county
but
that
goarly
for
the
last
two
years
had
never
owned
any
goose
but
this
one
the
foxes
have
eaten
them
all
asked
the
senator
every
mortal
one
and
the
gentlemen
of
the
hunt
have
paid
you
nothing
i
had
four
once
said
the
woman
if
you
do
send
the
heads

get

said
the
man
and
then
they
keep
you
waiting
months
and
months
just
for
their
pleasures
who
a
going
to
put
up
with
that
i
ai
and
now
you
going
to
law
i
am
like
a
man
his
lordship

nothin
to
me
i
ai
afeard
of
his
lordship
will
it
cost
you
much
that
just
what
it
will
do
sir
said
the
woman
did
i
tell
you
hold
your
jaw
the
was
going
to
offer
to
help
us
a
little
dan
i
was
going
to
say
that
i
am
interested
in
the
case
and
that
you
have
all
my
good
wishes
i
do
not
like
to
offer
pecuniary
help
you
very
good
sir
very
good
this
bit
of
land
is
mine
not
a
doubt
of
it
but
we
poor
sir
indeed
we
is
said
the
woman
what
with
taxes
and
rates
and
them
foxes
as
wo
let
me
rear
a
head
of
poultry
and
them
brutes
of
birds
as
eats
up
the
corn
i
often
tells
him
he
better
sell
the
bit
land
and
just
set
up
for
a
public
it
belonged
to
my
feyther
and
grandfeyther
said
goarly
then
the
senator
heart
was
softened
again
and
he
explained
at
great
length
that
he
would
watch
the
case
and
if
he
saw
his
way
clearly
befriend
it
with
substantial
aid
he
asked
about
the
attorney
and
took
down
bearside
address
after
that
he
shook
hands
with
both
of
them
and
then
made
his
way
back
to
bragton
through
farm
and
goarly
were
left
in
a
state
of
great
perturbation
of
mind
they
could
not
in
the
least
make
out
among
themselves
who
the
gentleman
was
or
whether
he
had
come
for
good
or
evil
that
he
called
himself
gotobed
goarly
did
remember
and
also
that
he
had
said
that
he
was
an
american
all
that
which
had
referred
to
senatorial
honours
and
the
state
of
mickewa
had
been
lost
upon
goarly
the
question
of
course
arose
whether
he
was
not
a
spy
sent
out
by
lord
rufford
man
of
business
and
goarly
was
clearly
of
opinion
that
such
had
been
the
nature
of
his
employment
had
he
really
been
a
friend
she
suggested
he
would
have
left
a
sovereign
behind
him
he
did
get
no
information
from
me
said
goarly
only
about
mr
bearside
what
the
odds
of
that
they
all
knows
that
bearside
why
should
i
be
ashamed
of
bearside
i
do
a
deal
better
with
bearside
than
i
would
with
that
old
woman
masters
but
he
took
it
down
in
writing
dan
what
the
d
the
odds
in
that
i
do
like
it
when
they
puts
it
down
in
writing
hold
your
jaw
said
goarly
as
he
slowly
shouldered
the
to
take
it
back
to
his
work
but
as
they
again
discussed
the
matter
that
night
the
opinion
gained
ground
upon
them
that
the
senator
had
been
an
emissary
from
the
enemy
chapter
xvii
lord
rufford
invitation
on
that
same
wednesday
afternoon
when
morton
returned
with
the
ladies
in
the
carriage
he
found
that
a
mounted
servant
had
arrived
from
rufford
hall
with
a
letter
and
had
been
instructed
to
wait
for
an
answer
the
man
was
now
refreshing
himself
in
the
servants
hall
morton
when
he
had
read
the
letter
found
that
it
required
some
consideration
before
he
could
answer
it
it
was
to
the
following
purport
lord
rufford
had
a
party
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
at
rufford
hall
as
his
sister
lady
penwether
was
staying
with
him
would
morton
and
his
guests
come
over
to
rufford
hall
on
monday
and
stay
till
wednesday
on
tuesday
there
was
to
be
a
dance
for
the
people
of
the
neighbourhood
then
he
specified
as
the
guests
invited
lady
augustus
and
her
daughter
and
gotobed
omitting
the
honourable
morton
of
whose
sojourn
in
the
county
he
might
have
been
ignorant
his
lordship
went
on
to
say
that
he
trusted
the
abruptness
of
the
invitation
might
be
excused
on
account
of
the
nearness
of
their
neighbourhood
and
the
old
friendship
which
had
existed
between
their
families
he
had
had
he
said
the
pleasure
of
being
acquainted
with
lady
augustus
and
her
daughter
in
london
and
would
be
proud
to
see
gotobed
at
his
house
during
his
sojourn
in
the
county
then
he
added
in
a
postscript
that
the
hounds
met
at
rufford
hall
on
tuesday
and
that
he
had
a
horse
that
carried
a
lady
well
if
miss
trefoil
would
like
to
ride
him
he
could
also
put
up
a
horse
for
morton
this
was
all
very
civil
but
there
was
something
in
it
that
was
almost
too
civil
there
came
upon
morton
a
suspicion
which
he
did
not
even
define
to
himself
that
the
invitation
was
due
to
charms
there
were
many
reasons
why
he
did
not
wish
to
accept
it
his
grandmother
was
left
out
and
he
feared
that
she
would
be
angry
he
did
not
feel
inclined
to
take
the
american
senator
to
the
house
knowing
as
he
did
that
the
american
senator
was
interfering
in
a
ridiculous
manner
on
behalf
of
goarly
and
he
did
not
particularly
wish
to
be
present
at
rufford
hall
with
the
trefoil
ladies
hitherto
he
had
received
very
little
satisfaction
from
their
visit
to
bragton
so
little
that
he
had
been
more
than
once
on
the
verge
of
asking
arabella
whether
she
wished
to
be
relieved
from
her
engagement
she
had
never
quite
given
him
the
opportunity
she
had
always
been
gracious
to
him
in
a
cold
disagreeable
glassy
manner
in
a
manner
that
irked
his
spirit
but
still
did
not
justify
him
in
expressing
anger
lady
augustus
was
almost
uncivil
to
him
and
from
time
to
time
said
little
things
which
were
hard
to
bear
but
he
was
not
going
to
marry
lady
augustus
and
could
revenge
himself
against
her
by
resolving
in
his
own
breast
that
he
would
have
as
little
as
possible
to
do
with
her
after
his
marriage
that
was
the
condition
of
his
mind
towards
them
and
in
that
condition
he
did
not
want
to
take
them
to
lord
rufford
house
their
visit
to
him
would
be
over
on
monday
and
it
would
he
thought
be
better
for
him
that
they
should
then
go
on
their
way
to
the
gores
as
they
had
proposed
but
he
did
not
like
to
answer
the
letter
by
a
refusal
without
saying
a
word
to
his
guests
on
the
subject
he
would
not
object
to
ignore
the
senator
but
he
was
afraid
that
if
nothing
were
to
be
said
to
arabella
she
would
hear
of
it
hereafter
and
would
complain
of
such
treatment
he
therefore
directed
that
the
man
might
be
kept
waiting
while
he
consulted
the
lady
of
his
choice
it
was
with
difficulty
that
he
found
himself
alone
with
her
and
then
only
by
sending
her
maid
in
quest
of
her
he
did
get
her
at
last
into
his
own
and
then
having
placed
her
in
a
chair
near
the
fire
gave
her
lord
rufford
letter
to
read
what
can
it
be
said
she
looking
up
into
his
face
with
her
great
inexpressive
eyes
that
has
required
all
this
solemnity
she
still
looked
up
at
him
and
did
not
even
open
the
letter
i
did
not
like
to
answer
that
without
showing
it
to
you
i
suppose
you
would
care
to
go
go
where
it
is
from
lord
rufford
for
monday
from
lord
rufford
it
would
break
up
all
your
plans
and
your
mother
and
would
probably
be
a
great
bore
then
she
did
read
the
letter
very
carefully
and
very
slowly
weighing
every
word
of
it
as
she
read
it
did
it
mean
more
than
it
said
but
though
she
read
it
slowly
and
carefully
and
was
long
before
she
made
him
any
answer
she
had
very
quickly
resolved
that
the
invitation
should
be
accepted
it
would
suit
her
very
well
to
know
lady
penwether
it
might
possibly
suit
her
still
better
to
become
intimate
with
lord
rufford
she
was
delighted
at
the
idea
of
riding
lord
rufford
horse
as
her
eyes
dwelt
on
the
paper
she
too
began
to
think
that
the
invitation
had
been
chiefly
given
on
her
account
at
any
rate
she
would
go
she
had
understood
perfectly
well
from
the
first
tone
of
her
lover
voice
that
he
did
not
wish
to
subject
her
to
the
allurements
of
rufford
hall
she
was
clever
enough
and
could
read
it
all
but
she
did
not
mean
to
throw
away
a
chance
for
the
sake
of
pleasing
him
she
must
not
at
once
displease
him
by
declaring
her
purpose
strongly
and
therefore
as
she
slowly
continued
her
reading
she
resolved
that
she
would
throw
the
burden
upon
her
mother
had
i
not
better
show
this
to
mamma
she
said
you
can
if
you
please
you
are
going
to
the
gores
on
monday
we
could
not
go
earlier
but
we
might
put
it
off
for
a
couple
of
days
if
we
pleased
would
it
bore
you
i
do
mind
about
myself
i
not
a
very
great
man
for
dances
you
sooner
write
a
report
would
you
about
the
products
of
the
country
a
great
deal
sooner
said
the
paragon
but
you
see
we
have
all
of
us
got
products
to
write
about
i
do
care
very
much
about
it
myself
but
if
you
do
mind
i
ask
mamma
of
course
he
was
obliged
to
consent
and
merely
informed
her
as
she
went
off
with
the
letter
that
a
servant
was
waiting
for
an
answer
to
go
to
lord
rufford
said
lady
augustus
from
monday
till
wednesday
mamma
of
course
we
must
go
i
promised
poor
mrs
gore
nonsense
mamma
the
gores
can
do
very
well
without
us
that
was
only
to
be
a
week
and
we
can
still
stay
out
our
time
of
course
this
has
only
been
sent
because
we
are
here
i
should
say
so
i
do
suppose
lord
rufford
would
care
to
know
morton
lady
penwether
goes
everywhere
does
she
everywhere
it
would
suit
me
to
a
to
get
on
to
lady
books
but
mamma
of
course
it
not
that
if
lord
rufford
should
say
a
word
it
is
so
much
easier
to
manage
down
in
the
country
than
up
in
london
he
has
a
year
if
he
has
a
penny
how
many
girls
have
tried
the
same
thing
with
him
but
i
do
mind
i
always
said
that
john
morton
and
bragton
would
not
do
no
mamma
you
have
you
were
the
first
to
say
they
would
do
i
only
said
that
if
there
were
nothing
else
oh
mamma
how
can
you
say
such
things
nothing
else
as
if
he
were
the
last
man
you
said
distinctly
that
bragton
was
a
year
and
that
it
would
do
very
well
you
may
change
your
mind
if
you
like
but
it
no
good
trying
to
back
out
of
your
own
doings
then
i
have
changed
my
mind
yes
without
thinking
what
i
have
to
go
through
i
not
going
to
throw
myself
at
lord
rufford
head
so
as
to
lose
my
chance
here
but
we
go
and
see
how
the
land
lies
of
course
you
go
mamma
if
you
think
it
is
for
your
advantage
my
dear
my
advantage
it
part
of
the
work
to
be
done
and
we
may
as
well
do
it
at
any
rate
i
tell
him
to
accept
we
shall
have
this
odious
american
with
us
but
that
ca
be
helped
and
the
old
woman
lord
rufford
does
say
anything
about
her
i
do
suppose
such
a
muff
but
what
he
can
leave
his
grandmother
behind
for
a
couple
of
days
then
she
went
back
to
morton
and
told
him
that
her
mother
was
particularly
anxious
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
lady
penwether
and
that
she
had
decided
upon
going
to
rufford
hall
it
will
be
a
very
nice
opportunity
said
she
for
you
to
become
acquainted
with
lord
rufford
then
he
was
almost
angry
i
can
make
plenty
of
such
opportunities
for
myself
when
i
want
them
he
said
of
course
if
you
and
lady
augustus
like
it
we
will
go
but
let
it
stand
on
its
right
bottom
it
may
stand
on
any
bottom
you
please
do
you
mean
to
ride
the
man
horse
certainly
i
do
i
never
refuse
a
good
offer
why
should
i
ride
the
man
horse
did
you
never
hear
before
of
a
young
lady
borrowing
a
gentleman
horse
no
lady
belonging
to
me
will
ever
do
so
unless
the
gentleman
be
a
very
close
friend
indeed
the
lady
in
this
case
does
not
belong
to
you
morton
and
therefore
if
you
have
no
other
objection
she
will
ride
lord
rufford
horse
perhaps
you
will
not
think
it
too
much
trouble
to
signify
the
lady
acceptance
of
the
mount
in
your
letter
then
she
swam
out
of
the
room
knowing
that
she
left
him
in
anger
after
that
he
had
to
find
gotobed
the
going
was
now
decided
on
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
and
it
would
make
very
little
difference
whether
the
american
went
or
not
except
that
his
letter
would
have
been
easier
to
him
in
accepting
the
invitation
for
three
persons
than
for
four
but
the
senator
was
of
course
willing
it
was
the
senator
object
to
see
england
and
lord
rufford
house
would
be
an
additional
bit
of
england
the
senator
would
be
delighted
to
have
an
opportunity
of
saying
what
he
thought
about
goarly
at
lord
rufford
table
after
that
before
this
weary
letter
could
be
written
he
was
compelled
to
see
his
grandmother
and
explain
to
her
that
she
had
been
omitted
of
course
they
did
not
know
that
you
were
at
bragton
as
you
were
not
in
the
carriage
at
the
that
nonsense
john
did
lord
rufford
suppose
that
you
were
entertaining
ladies
here
without
some
one
to
be
mistress
of
the
house
of
course
he
knew
that
i
was
here
i
should
have
gone
you
may
be
sure
of
that
i
not
in
the
habit
of
going
to
the
houses
of
people
i
do
know
indeed
i
think
it
an
impertinence
in
them
to
ask
in
that
way
i
surprised
that
you
would
go
on
such
an
invitation
the
trefoils
knew
them
if
lady
penwether
knew
them
why
could
not
lady
penwether
ask
them
independently
of
us
i
do
believe
they
ever
spoke
to
lady
penwether
in
their
lives
lord
rufford
and
miss
trefoil
may
very
likely
be
london
acquaintances
he
may
admire
her
and
therefore
choose
to
have
her
at
his
ball
i
know
nothing
about
that
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
he
quite
welcome
to
keep
her
all
this
was
not
very
pleasant
to
john
morton
he
knew
already
that
his
grandmother
and
lady
augustus
hated
each
other
and
said
spiteful
things
not
only
behind
each
other
backs
but
openly
to
each
faces
but
now
he
had
been
told
by
the
girl
who
was
engaged
to
be
his
wife
that
she
did
not
belong
to
him
and
by
his
grandmother
who
stood
to
him
in
the
place
of
his
mother
that
she
wished
that
this
girl
belonged
to
some
one
else
he
was
not
quite
sure
that
he
did
not
wish
it
himself
but
even
were
it
to
be
so
and
should
there
be
reason
for
him
to
be
gratified
at
the
escape
still
he
did
not
relish
the
idea
of
taking
the
girl
himself
to
the
other
man
house
he
wrote
the
letter
however
and
dispatched
it
but
even
the
writing
of
it
was
difficult
and
disagreeable
when
various
details
of
hospitality
have
been
offered
by
a
comparative
stranger
a
man
hardly
likes
to
accept
them
all
but
in
this
case
he
had
to
do
it
he
would
be
delighted
he
said
to
stay
at
rufford
hall
from
the
monday
to
the
wednesday
lady
augustus
and
miss
trefoil
would
also
be
delighted
and
so
also
would
gotobed
be
delighted
and
miss
trefoil
would
be
further
delighted
to
accept
lord
rufford
offer
of
a
horse
for
the
tuesday
as
for
himself
if
he
rode
at
all
a
horse
would
come
for
him
to
the
meet
then
he
wrote
another
note
to
harry
stubbings
bespeaking
a
mount
for
the
occasion
on
that
evening
the
party
at
bragton
was
not
a
very
pleasant
one
no
doubt
you
are
intimate
with
lady
penwether
lady
augustus
said
morton
now
lady
penwether
was
a
very
fashionable
woman
whom
to
know
was
considered
an
honour
what
makes
you
ask
said
lady
augustus
only
as
you
were
taking
your
daughter
to
her
brother
house
and
as
he
is
a
bachelor
my
dear
morton
really
you
may
leave
me
to
take
care
of
myself
and
of
my
daughter
too
you
have
lived
so
much
out
of
the
world
for
the
last
thirty
years
that
it
is
quite
amusing
there
are
some
persons
worlds
that
it
is
a
great
deal
better
for
a
lady
to
be
out
of
said
morton
then
lady
augustus
put
up
her
hands
and
turned
round
and
affected
to
laugh
of
all
which
things
gotobed
who
was
studying
english
society
made
notes
in
his
own
mind
what
sort
of
position
does
that
man
goarly
occupy
here
the
senator
asked
immediately
after
dinner
no
position
at
all
said
morton
every
man
created
holds
some
position
as
i
take
it
the
land
is
his
own
he
has
i
believe
about
fifty
acres
and
yet
he
seems
to
be
in
the
lowest
depth
of
poverty
and
ignorance
of
course
he
mismanages
his
property
and
probably
drinks
i
dare
say
morton
he
is
proud
of
his
rights
and
talked
of
his
father
and
his
grandfather
and
yet
i
doubt
whether
you
would
find
a
man
so
squalid
and
so
ignorant
in
all
the
states
i
suppose
he
is
injured
by
having
a
lord
so
near
him
quite
the
contrary
if
he
would
be
amenable
you
mean
if
he
would
be
a
creature
of
the
lord
and
why
was
that
other
man
so
uncivil
to
me
the
man
who
was
the
lord
gamekeeper
because
you
went
there
as
a
friend
of
goarly
and
that
his
idea
of
english
fair
play
asked
the
senator
with
a
jeer
the
truth
is
gotobed
said
morton
endeavouring
to
explain
it
all
you
see
a
part
only
and
not
the
whole
that
man
goarly
is
a
rascal
so
everybody
says
and
why
ca
you
believe
everybody
so
everybody
says
on
the
lord
side
but
before
i
done
i
find
out
what
people
say
on
the
other
side
i
can
see
that
he
is
ignorant
and
squalid
but
that
very
probably
is
the
lord
fault
it
may
be
that
he
is
a
rascal
and
that
the
lord
is
to
blame
for
that
too
but
if
the
lord
pheasants
have
eaten
up
goarly
corn
the
lord
ought
to
pay
for
the
corn
whether
goarly
be
a
rascal
or
not
then
john
morton
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
never
ask
another
american
senator
to
his
house
chapter
xviii
the
attorney
family
is
disturbed
on
that
wednesday
evening
mary
masters
said
nothing
to
any
of
her
family
as
to
the
invitation
from
lady
ushant
she
very
much
wished
to
accept
it
latterly
for
the
last
month
or
two
her
distaste
to
the
kind
of
life
for
which
her
stepmother
was
preparing
her
had
increased
upon
her
greatly
there
had
been
days
in
which
she
had
doubted
whether
it
might
not
be
expedient
that
she
should
accept
twentyman
offer
she
believed
no
ill
of
him
she
thought
him
to
be
a
fine
manly
young
fellow
with
a
good
heart
and
high
principles
she
never
asked
herself
whether
he
were
or
were
not
a
gentleman
she
had
never
even
inquired
of
herself
whether
she
herself
were
or
were
not
especially
a
lady
but
with
all
her
efforts
to
like
the
man
because
she
thought
that
by
doing
so
she
would
relieve
and
please
her
father
yet
he
was
distasteful
to
her
and
now
since
that
walk
home
with
him
from
bragton
bridge
he
was
more
distasteful
than
ever
she
did
not
tell
herself
that
a
short
visit
say
for
a
month
to
cheltenham
would
prevent
his
further
attentions
but
she
felt
that
there
would
be
a
temporary
escape
i
do
not
think
that
she
dwelt
much
on
the
suggestion
that
reginald
morton
should
be
her
companion
on
the
journey
but
the
idea
of
such
companionship
even
for
a
short
time
was
pleasant
to
her
if
he
did
this
surely
then
he
would
forgive
her
for
having
left
him
at
the
bridge
she
had
much
to
think
of
before
she
could
resolve
how
she
should
tell
her
tidings
should
she
show
the
letter
first
to
her
stepmother
or
to
her
father
in
the
ordinary
course
of
things
in
that
house
the
former
course
would
be
expected
it
was
masters
who
managed
everything
affecting
the
family
it
was
she
who
gave
permission
or
denied
permission
for
every
indulgence
she
was
generally
fair
to
the
three
girls
taking
special
pride
to
herself
for
doing
her
duty
by
her
stepdaughter
but
on
this
very
account
she
was
the
more
likely
to
be
angry
if
mary
passed
her
by
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
and
went
to
her
father
but
should
her
stepmother
have
once
refused
her
permission
then
the
matter
would
have
been
decided
against
her
it
would
be
quite
useless
to
appeal
from
her
stepmother
to
her
father
nor
would
such
an
appeal
come
within
the
scope
of
her
own
principles
the
mortons
and
especially
lady
ushant
had
been
her
father
friends
in
old
days
and
she
thought
that
perhaps
she
might
prevail
in
this
case
if
she
could
speak
to
her
father
first
she
knew
well
what
would
be
the
great
or
rather
the
real
objection
her
mother
would
not
wish
that
she
should
be
removed
so
long
from
larry
twentyman
there
might
be
difficulties
about
her
clothes
but
her
father
she
knew
would
be
kind
to
her
at
last
she
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
ask
her
father
he
was
always
at
his
for
half
an
hour
in
the
morning
before
the
clerks
had
come
and
on
the
following
day
a
minute
or
two
after
he
had
taken
his
seat
she
knocked
at
the
door
he
was
busy
reading
a
letter
from
lord
rufford
man
of
business
asking
him
certain
questions
about
goarly
and
almost
employing
him
to
get
up
the
case
on
lord
rufford
behalf
there
was
a
certain
triumph
to
him
in
this
it
was
not
by
his
means
that
tidings
had
reached
lord
rufford
of
his
refusal
to
undertake
goarly
case
but
runciman
who
was
often
allowed
by
his
lordship
to
say
a
few
words
to
him
in
the
had
mentioned
the
circumstance
a
man
like
masters
is
better
without
such
a
blackguard
as
that
the
lord
had
said
then
runciman
had
replied
no
doubt
my
lord
no
doubt
but
dillsborough
is
a
poor
place
and
business
is
business
my
lord
then
lord
rufford
had
remembered
it
and
the
letter
which
the
attorney
was
somewhat
triumphantly
reading
had
been
the
consequence
is
that
you
mary
what
can
i
do
for
you
my
love
papa
i
want
you
to
read
this
then
masters
read
the
letter
i
should
so
like
to
go
should
you
my
dear
oh
yes
lady
ushant
has
been
so
kind
to
me
all
my
life
and
i
do
so
love
her
what
does
mamma
say
i
have
asked
mamma
is
there
any
reason
why
you
should
go
of
that
one
reason
as
to
larry
twentyman
of
course
she
would
say
nothing
she
must
leave
him
to
discuss
that
with
her
mother
i
should
want
some
clothes
papa
a
dress
and
some
boots
and
a
new
hat
and
there
would
be
money
for
the
journey
and
a
few
other
things
the
attorney
winced
but
at
the
same
time
remembered
that
something
was
due
to
his
eldest
child
in
the
way
of
garments
and
relaxation
i
never
like
to
be
an
expense
papa
you
are
very
good
about
that
my
dear
i
do
see
why
you
go
it
very
kind
of
lady
ushant
i
talk
to
mamma
then
mary
went
away
to
get
the
breakfast
fearing
that
before
long
there
would
be
black
looks
in
the
house
masters
at
once
went
up
to
his
wife
having
given
himself
a
minute
or
two
to
calculate
that
he
would
let
mary
have
twenty
pounds
for
the
occasion
and
made
his
proposition
i
never
heard
of
such
nonsense
in
my
life
said
masters
nonsense
my
dear
why
should
it
be
nonsense
cocking
her
up
with
lady
ushant
what
good
will
lady
ushant
do
her
she
not
going
to
live
with
ladies
of
quality
all
her
life
why
should
she
live
with
ladies
you
know
what
i
mean
gregory
the
mortons
have
dropped
you
for
any
use
they
were
to
you
long
ago
and
you
may
as
well
make
up
your
mind
to
drop
them
you
go
on
hankering
after
gentlefolks
till
about
ruined
yourself
when
he
remembered
that
he
had
that
very
morning
received
a
commission
from
lord
rufford
he
thought
that
this
was
a
little
too
bad
but
he
was
not
now
in
a
humour
to
make
known
to
her
this
piece
of
good
news
i
like
to
feel
that
she
has
got
friends
he
said
going
back
to
mary
proposed
visit
of
course
she
has
got
friends
if
she
only
take
up
with
them
as
she
ought
to
do
why
does
she
go
on
with
that
young
man
instead
of
closing
upon
it
at
once
if
she
did
that
she
want
such
friends
as
lady
ushant
why
did
the
girl
come
to
you
with
all
this
instead
of
asking
me
there
would
be
a
little
money
wanted
money
yes
i
dare
say
it
very
easy
to
want
money
but
very
hard
to
get
it
if
you
send
clients
away
out
of
the
office
with
a
flea
in
their
ear
i
do
see
how
she
to
have
all
manner
of
luxuries
she
ought
to
have
come
to
me
i
do
see
that
at
all
my
dear
if
i
to
look
after
her
she
shall
be
said
by
me
that
all
done
for
her
just
as
i
have
for
my
own
and
i
not
going
to
have
her
turn
up
her
nose
at
me
directly
she
wants
anything
for
herself
i
know
what
fit
for
mary
and
it
ai
fit
that
she
should
go
trapesing
away
to
cheltenham
doing
nothing
in
that
old
parlour
and
losing
her
chances
for
life
who
is
to
suppose
that
larry
twentyman
will
go
on
dangling
after
her
in
this
way
month
after
month
the
young
man
wants
a
wife
and
of
course
he
get
one
you
ca
make
her
marry
the
man
if
she
do
like
him
like
him
she
ought
to
be
made
to
like
him
a
young
man
well
off
as
he
is
and
she
without
a
shilling
all
that
comes
from
ushanting
it
never
occurred
to
masters
that
perhaps
the
very
qualities
that
had
made
poor
larry
so
vehemently
in
love
with
mary
had
come
from
her
intercourse
with
lady
ushant
if
i
to
have
my
way
she
wo
go
a
yard
on
the
way
to
cheltenham
i
told
her
she
may
go
said
masters
whose
mind
was
wandering
back
to
old
days
to
his
first
wife
and
to
the
time
when
he
used
to
be
an
occasional
guest
in
the
big
parlour
at
bragton
he
was
always
ready
to
acknowledge
to
himself
that
his
present
wife
was
a
good
and
helpful
companion
to
him
and
a
careful
mother
to
his
children
but
there
were
moments
in
which
he
would
remember
with
soft
regret
a
different
phase
of
his
life
just
at
present
he
was
somewhat
angry
and
resolving
in
his
own
mind
that
in
this
case
he
would
have
his
own
way
then
i
shall
tell
her
she
may
said
masters
with
a
look
of
dogged
determination
i
hope
you
will
do
nothing
of
the
kind
my
dear
i
told
her
that
she
shall
have
a
few
pounds
to
get
what
she
wants
and
i
wo
have
her
disappointed
after
that
masters
bounced
out
of
the
room
and
made
herself
very
disagreeable
indeed
over
the
the
whole
household
was
much
disturbed
that
day
masters
said
nothing
to
mary
about
lady
ushant
all
the
morning
but
said
a
great
deal
about
other
things
poor
mary
was
asked
whether
she
was
not
ashamed
to
treat
a
young
man
as
she
was
treating
twentyman
then
again
it
was
demanded
of
her
whether
she
thought
it
right
that
all
the
house
should
be
knocked
about
for
her
at
dinner
masters
would
hardly
speak
to
her
husband
but
addressed
herself
exclusively
to
dolly
and
kate
masters
was
not
a
man
who
could
usually
stand
this
kind
of
thing
very
long
and
was
accustomed
to
give
up
in
despair
and
then
take
himself
off
to
the
solace
of
his
but
on
the
present
occasion
he
went
through
his
meal
like
a
spartan
and
retired
from
the
room
without
a
sign
of
surrender
in
the
afternoon
about
five
mary
watched
her
opportunity
and
found
him
again
alone
it
was
incumbent
on
her
to
reply
to
lady
ushant
would
it
not
be
better
that
she
should
write
and
say
how
sorry
she
was
that
she
could
not
come
but
i
want
you
to
go
said
he
oh
papa
i
can
not
bear
to
cause
trouble
no
my
dear
no
and
i
sure
i
do
like
trouble
myself
but
in
this
case
i
think
you
ought
to
go
what
day
has
she
named
then
mary
declared
that
she
could
not
possibly
go
so
soon
as
lady
ushant
had
suggested
but
that
she
could
be
ready
by
the
of
december
then
write
and
tell
her
so
my
dear
and
i
will
let
your
mother
know
that
it
is
fixed
but
mary
still
hesitated
desiring
to
know
whether
she
had
not
better
speak
to
her
mother
first
i
think
you
had
better
write
your
letter
first
and
then
he
absolutely
made
her
write
it
in
the
office
and
give
it
to
him
to
be
posted
after
that
he
promised
to
communicate
to
reginald
morton
what
had
been
done
the
household
was
very
much
disturbed
the
whole
of
that
evening
poor
mary
never
remembered
such
a
state
of
things
and
when
there
had
been
any
difference
of
opinion
she
had
hitherto
never
been
the
cause
of
it
now
it
was
all
owing
to
her
and
things
were
said
so
terrible
that
she
hardly
knew
how
to
bear
them
her
father
had
promised
her
the
twenty
pounds
and
it
was
insinuated
that
all
the
comforts
of
the
family
must
be
stopped
because
of
this
lavish
extravagance
her
father
sat
still
and
bore
it
almost
without
a
word
both
dolly
and
kate
were
silent
and
wretched
masters
every
now
and
then
gurgled
in
her
throat
and
three
or
four
times
wiped
her
eyes
better
out
of
the
way
altogether
she
said
at
last
jumping
up
and
walking
towards
the
door
as
though
she
were
going
to
leave
the
room
and
the
house
for
ever
mamma
said
mary
rising
from
her
seat
i
wo
go
i
write
and
tell
lady
ushant
that
i
ca
do
it
you
not
to
mind
me
said
masters
you
to
do
what
your
papa
tells
you
everything
that
i
been
striving
at
is
to
be
thrown
away
i
to
be
nobody
and
it
quite
right
that
your
papa
should
tell
you
so
dear
mamma
do
talk
like
that
said
mary
clinging
hold
of
her
stepmother
your
papa
sits
there
and
wo
say
a
word
said
masters
stamping
her
foot
what
the
good
of
speaking
when
you
go
on
like
that
before
the
children
said
masters
getting
up
from
his
chair
i
say
that
it
a
proper
thing
that
the
girl
should
go
to
see
the
old
friend
who
brought
her
up
and
has
been
always
kind
to
her
and
she
shall
go
masters
seated
herself
on
the
nearest
chair
and
leaning
her
head
against
the
wall
began
to
go
into
hysterics
your
letter
has
already
gone
mary
and
i
desire
you
will
write
no
other
without
letting
me
know
then
he
left
the
room
and
the
house
and
absolutely
went
over
to
the
bush
this
latter
proceeding
was
however
hardly
more
than
a
bravado
for
he
merely
took
the
opportunity
of
asking
runciman
a
question
at
the
bar
and
then
walked
back
to
his
own
house
and
shut
himself
up
in
the
office
on
the
next
morning
he
called
on
reginald
morton
and
told
him
that
his
daughter
had
accepted
lady
ushant
invitation
but
could
not
go
till
the
i
shall
be
proud
to
take
charge
of
her
said
reginald
and
as
for
the
change
in
the
day
it
will
suit
me
all
the
better
so
that
was
settled
on
the
next
day
friday
masters
did
not
come
down
to
breakfast
but
was
waited
upon
upstairs
by
her
own
daughters
this
with
her
was
a
most
unusual
circumstance
the
two
maids
were
of
opinion
that
such
a
thing
had
never
occurred
before
and
that
therefore
masters
must
have
been
out
half
the
night
at
the
although
they
had
not
known
it
to
mary
she
would
hardly
speak
a
word
she
appeared
at
dinner
and
called
her
husband
masters
when
she
helped
him
to
stew
all
the
afternoon
she
averred
that
her
head
was
splitting
but
managed
to
say
many
very
bitter
things
about
gentlemen
in
general
and
expressed
a
vehement
hope
that
that
poor
man
goarly
would
get
at
least
a
hundred
pounds
it
must
be
owned
however
that
at
this
time
she
had
heard
nothing
of
lord
rufford
commission
to
her
husband
in
the
evening
larry
came
in
and
was
at
once
told
the
terrible
news
larry
said
kate
mary
is
going
away
for
a
month
where
are
you
going
mary
asked
the
lover
eagerly
to
lady
ushant
mr
twentyman
for
a
month
she
has
asked
me
for
a
month
said
mary
it
a
regular
fool
errand
said
masters
it
not
done
with
my
consent
twentyman
i
do
think
she
ought
to
stir
from
home
till
things
are
more
settled
they
can
be
settled
this
moment
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
said
larry
standing
up
there
now
said
masters
at
this
time
masters
was
not
in
the
room
if
you
can
make
it
straight
with
twentyman
i
wo
say
a
word
against
your
going
away
for
a
month
mamma
you
should
exclaimed
mary
i
hate
such
nonsense
twentyman
is
behaving
honest
and
genteel
what
more
would
you
have
give
him
an
answer
like
a
sensible
girl
i
have
given
him
an
answer
and
i
can
not
say
anything
more
said
mary
as
she
left
the
room
chapter
xix
who
valued
the
geese
before
the
time
had
come
for
the
visit
to
rufford
hall
gotobed
had
called
upon
bearside
the
attorney
and
had
learned
as
much
as
bearside
chose
to
tell
him
of
the
facts
of
the
case
this
took
place
on
the
saturday
morning
and
the
interview
was
on
the
whole
satisfactory
to
the
senator
but
then
having
a
theory
of
his
own
in
his
head
and
being
fond
of
ventilating
his
own
theories
he
explained
thoroughly
to
the
man
the
story
which
he
wished
to
hear
before
the
man
was
called
upon
to
tell
his
story
bearside
of
course
told
it
accordingly
goarly
was
a
very
poor
man
and
very
ignorant
was
perhaps
not
altogether
so
good
a
member
of
society
as
he
might
have
been
but
no
doubt
he
had
a
strong
case
against
the
lord
the
lord
so
said
bearside
had
fallen
into
a
way
of
paying
a
certain
recompense
in
certain
cases
for
crops
damaged
by
game
and
having
in
this
way
laid
down
a
rule
for
himself
did
not
choose
to
have
that
rule
disturbed
just
feudalism
said
the
indignant
senator
no
better
nor
yet
no
worse
than
that
sir
said
the
attorney
who
did
not
in
the
least
know
what
feudalism
was
the
strong
hand
backed
by
the
strong
rank
and
the
strong
purse
determined
to
have
its
own
way
continued
the
senator
a
most
determined
man
is
his
lordship
said
the
attorney
then
the
senator
expressed
his
hope
that
bearside
would
be
able
to
see
the
poor
man
through
it
and
bearside
explained
to
the
senator
that
the
poor
man
was
a
very
poor
man
indeed
who
had
been
so
unfortunate
with
his
land
that
he
was
hardly
able
to
provide
bread
for
himself
and
his
children
he
went
so
far
as
to
insinuate
that
he
was
taking
up
this
matter
himself
solely
on
the
score
of
charity
adding
that
as
he
could
not
of
course
afford
to
be
money
out
of
pocket
for
expenses
of
witnesses
he
did
not
quite
see
how
he
was
to
proceed
then
the
senator
made
certain
promises
he
was
he
said
going
back
to
london
in
the
course
of
next
week
but
he
did
not
mind
making
himself
responsible
to
the
extent
of
fifty
dollars
if
the
thing
were
carried
on
bonâ
fide
to
a
conclusion
bearside
declared
that
it
would
of
course
be
bonâ
fide
and
asked
the
senator
for
his
address
would
gotobed
object
to
putting
his
name
to
a
little
docket
certifying
to
the
amount
promised
gotobed
gave
an
address
but
thought
that
in
such
a
matter
as
that
his
word
might
be
trusted
if
it
were
not
trusted
then
the
offer
might
fall
to
the
ground
bearside
was
profuse
in
his
apologies
and
declared
that
the
gentleman
word
was
as
good
as
his
bond
gotobed
made
no
secret
of
his
doings
perhaps
he
had
a
feeling
that
he
could
not
justify
himself
in
so
strange
a
proceeding
without
absolute
candour
he
saw
mainwaring
in
the
street
as
he
left
bearside
office
and
told
him
all
about
it
i
just
want
sir
to
see
what
come
of
it
you
lose
your
fifty
dollars
gotobed
and
only
cause
a
little
vexation
to
a
young
nobleman
very
likely
sir
but
neither
the
loss
of
my
dollars
nor
lord
rufford
slight
vexation
will
in
the
least
disturb
my
rest
not
a
rich
man
sir
but
i
should
like
to
watch
the
way
in
which
such
a
question
will
be
tried
and
brought
to
a
conclusion
in
this
aristocratic
country
i
do
quite
know
what
your
laws
may
be
mr
mainwaring
just
the
same
as
your
own
gotobed
i
take
it
we
have
no
game
laws
sir
as
i
was
saying
i
do
understand
your
laws
but
justice
is
the
same
everywhere
if
this
great
lord
game
has
eaten
up
the
poor
man
wheat
the
great
lord
ought
to
pay
for
it
the
owners
of
game
pay
for
the
damage
they
do
three
times
over
said
the
parson
who
was
very
strongly
on
that
side
of
the
question
do
you
think
that
such
men
as
goarly
would
be
better
off
if
the
gentry
were
never
to
come
into
the
country
at
all
perhaps
mainwaring
i
may
think
that
there
would
be
no
goarlys
if
there
were
no
ruffords
that
however
is
a
great
question
which
can
not
be
argued
on
this
case
all
we
can
hope
here
is
that
one
poor
man
may
have
an
act
of
justice
done
him
though
in
seeking
for
it
he
has
to
struggle
against
so
wealthy
a
magnate
as
lord
rufford
what
i
hope
is
that
he
may
be
found
out
replied
mainwaring
with
equal
enthusiasm
and
then
he
will
be
in
rufford
gaol
before
long
that
the
justice
i
look
for
who
do
you
think
put
down
the
poison
in
dillsborough
wood
how
was
it
that
the
poor
woman
lost
all
her
geese
asked
the
senator
she
was
paid
for
a
great
many
more
than
she
lost
mr
gotobed
that
does
touch
upon
the
injustice
of
the
proceeding
who
assessed
the
loss
sir
who
valued
the
geese
am
i
to
keep
a
pet
tiger
in
my
garden
and
give
you
a
couple
of
dollars
when
he
destroys
your
pet
dog
and
think
myself
justified
because
dogs
as
a
rule
are
not
worth
more
than
two
dollars
each
she
has
a
right
to
her
own
geese
on
her
own
ground
and
lord
rufford
sir
as
i
take
it
said
runciman
who
had
been
allowed
to
come
up
and
hear
the
end
of
the
conversation
has
a
right
to
his
own
foxes
in
his
own
coverts
yes
if
he
could
keep
them
there
my
friend
but
as
it
is
the
nature
of
foxes
to
wander
away
and
to
be
thieves
he
has
no
such
right
of
course
sir
begging
your
pardon
said
runciman
i
was
speaking
of
england
runciman
had
heard
of
the
senator
gotobed
as
indeed
had
all
dillsborough
by
this
time
and
i
am
speaking
of
justice
all
the
world
over
said
the
senator
slapping
his
hand
upon
his
thigh
but
i
only
want
to
see
it
may
be
that
england
is
a
country
in
which
a
poor
man
should
not
attempt
to
hold
a
few
acres
of
land
on
that
night
the
dillsborough
club
met
as
usual
and
as
a
matter
of
course
goarly
and
the
american
senator
were
the
subjects
chiefly
discussed
everybody
in
the
room
knew
or
thought
that
he
knew
that
goarly
was
a
cheating
fraudulent
knave
and
that
lord
rufford
was
at
any
rate
in
this
case
acting
properly
they
all
understood
the
old
goose
and
were
aware
nearly
to
a
bushel
of
the
amount
of
wheat
which
the
man
had
sold
off
those
two
fields
runciman
knew
that
the
interest
on
the
mortgage
had
been
paid
and
could
only
have
been
paid
out
of
the
produce
and
larry
twentyman
knew
that
if
goarly
took
his
an
acre
he
would
be
better
off
than
if
the
wood
had
not
been
there
but
yet
among
them
all
they
did
quite
see
how
they
were
to
confute
the
senator
logic
they
could
not
answer
it
satisfactorily
even
among
themselves
but
they
felt
that
if
goarly
could
be
detected
in
some
offence
that
would
confute
the
senator
among
themselves
it
was
sufficient
to
repeat
the
fact
that
goarly
was
a
rascal
but
with
reference
to
this
aggravating
interfering
and
most
obnoxious
american
it
would
be
necessary
to
prove
it
his
lordship
has
put
it
into
masters
hands
i
told
said
the
doctor
at
this
time
neither
the
attorney
nor
larry
twentyman
was
in
the
room
he
could
have
done
better
said
runciman
speaking
from
behind
a
long
clay
pipe
all
the
same
he
was
nibbling
at
goarly
said
ned
botsey
i
do
know
that
he
was
nibbling
at
goarly
at
all
botsey
said
the
landlord
goarly
came
to
him
and
goarly
was
refused
what
more
would
you
have
it
all
one
to
me
said
botsey
only
i
do
think
that
in
a
sporting
county
like
this
the
place
ought
to
be
made
too
hot
to
hold
a
blackguard
like
that
if
he
comes
out
at
me
with
his
gun
i
ride
over
him
and
i
would
mind
riding
over
that
american
too
that
just
what
would
suit
goarly
book
said
the
doctor
exactly
what
goarly
would
like
said
harry
stubbings
then
masters
and
larry
entered
the
room
on
that
evening
two
things
had
occurred
to
the
attorney
nickem
had
returned
and
had
asked
for
and
received
an
additional
week
leave
of
absence
he
had
declined
to
explain
accurately
what
he
was
doing
but
gave
the
attorney
to
understand
that
he
thought
that
he
was
on
the
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
whole
thing
then
after
nickem
had
left
him
masters
had
a
letter
of
instructions
from
lord
rufford
steward
when
he
received
it
and
found
that
his
paid
services
had
been
absolutely
employed
on
behalf
of
his
lordship
he
almost
regretted
the
encouragement
he
had
given
to
nickem
in
the
first
place
he
might
want
nickem
and
then
he
felt
that
in
his
present
position
he
ought
not
to
be
a
party
to
anything
underhand
but
nickem
was
gone
and
he
was
obliged
to
console
himself
by
thinking
that
nickem
was
at
any
rate
employing
his
intellect
on
the
right
side
when
he
left
his
house
with
larry
twentyman
he
had
told
his
wife
nothing
about
lord
rufford
up
to
this
time
he
and
his
wife
had
not
as
yet
reconciled
their
difference
and
poor
mary
was
still
living
in
misery
larry
though
he
had
called
for
the
attorney
had
not
sat
down
in
the
parlour
and
had
barely
spoken
to
mary
for
gracious
sake
twentyman
do
let
him
stay
in
that
place
there
half
the
night
said
masters
it
ai
fit
for
a
father
of
a
family
father
never
does
stay
half
the
night
said
kate
who
took
more
liberties
in
that
house
than
any
one
else
hold
your
tongue
miss
i
do
know
whether
it
would
be
better
for
you
twentyman
if
you
were
not
there
so
often
yourself
poor
larry
felt
this
to
be
hard
he
was
not
even
engaged
as
yet
and
as
far
as
he
could
see
was
not
on
the
way
to
be
engaged
in
such
condition
surely
his
possible
could
have
no
right
to
interfere
with
him
he
condescended
to
make
no
reply
but
crossed
the
passage
and
carried
the
attorney
off
with
him
you
heard
what
that
american
gentleman
has
been
about
mr
masters
asked
the
landlord
i
told
he
been
with
bearside
and
has
offered
to
pay
his
bill
for
him
if
he
carry
on
the
business
for
goarly
whoever
heard
the
like
of
that
what
sort
of
a
man
is
he
asked
the
doctor
a
great
man
in
his
own
country
everybody
says
answered
runciman
i
wish
he
stayed
there
he
comes
over
here
and
thinks
he
understands
everything
just
as
though
he
had
lived
here
all
his
life
did
you
say
gin
cold
larry
and
rum
for
you
mr
masters
then
the
landlord
gave
the
orders
to
the
girl
who
had
answered
the
bell
but
they
say
he
actually
going
to
lord
rufford
said
young
botsey
who
would
have
given
one
of
his
fingers
to
be
asked
to
the
lord
house
they
are
all
going
from
bragton
said
runciman
the
young
squire
is
going
to
ride
one
of
my
horses
said
harry
stubbings
that
be
an
easy
three
pounds
in
your
pockets
harry
said
the
doctor
in
answer
to
which
harry
remarked
that
he
took
all
that
as
it
came
the
heavies
and
lights
together
and
that
there
was
not
much
change
to
be
got
out
of
three
sovereigns
when
some
gentlemen
had
had
a
horse
out
for
the
day
particularly
when
a
gentleman
did
pay
perhaps
for
twelve
months
the
whole
party
is
going
continued
the
landlord
how
he
is
to
have
the
cheek
to
go
into
his
lordship
house
after
what
he
is
doing
is
more
than
i
can
understand
what
business
is
it
of
his
said
larry
angrily
that
what
i
want
to
know
what
he
think
if
we
went
and
interfered
over
there
i
should
be
surprised
if
he
got
a
little
rough
usage
before
he
out
of
the
county
i
told
he
came
across
bean
when
he
was
ferretting
about
the
other
day
and
that
bean
gave
him
quite
as
good
as
he
brought
i
say
he
a
spy
said
ribbs
the
butcher
from
his
seat
on
the
sofa
i
hates
a
spy
soon
after
that
masters
left
the
room
and
larry
twentyman
followed
him
there
was
something
almost
ridiculous
in
the
way
the
young
man
would
follow
the
attorney
about
on
these
saturday
evenings
as
though
he
could
make
love
to
the
girl
by
talking
to
the
father
but
on
this
occasion
he
had
something
special
to
say
so
mary
going
to
cheltenham
mr
masters
yes
she
is
you
do
see
any
objection
to
that
i
hope
not
in
the
least
masters
i
wish
she
might
go
anywhere
to
enjoy
herself
and
from
all
i
heard
lady
ushant
is
a
very
good
sort
of
lady
a
very
good
sort
of
lady
she
wo
do
mary
any
harm
twentyman
i
do
suppose
she
will
but
there
one
thing
i
should
like
to
know
why
should
she
tell
me
before
she
goes
that
she
have
me
i
wish
she
would
with
all
my
heart
and
masters
is
all
on
my
side
quite
so
and
the
girls
have
always
been
my
friends
i
think
we
are
all
your
friends
twentyman
i
sure
mary
is
but
that
is
marrying
is
it
if
you
would
speak
to
her
mr
masters
what
would
you
have
me
say
i
could
bid
my
girl
to
have
one
man
or
another
i
could
only
tell
her
what
i
think
and
that
she
knows
already
if
you
were
to
say
that
you
wished
it
she
thinks
so
much
about
you
i
could
tell
her
that
i
wished
it
in
a
manner
that
would
drive
her
into
it
of
course
it
would
be
a
very
good
match
but
i
have
only
to
think
of
her
happiness
and
i
must
leave
her
to
judge
what
will
make
her
happy
i
should
like
to
have
it
fixed
some
way
before
she
starts
said
larry
in
an
altered
tone
of
course
you
are
your
own
master
twentyman
and
you
have
behaved
very
well
this
is
a
kind
of
thing
that
a
man
ca
stand
said
the
young
farmer
sulkily
good
night
mr
masters
then
he
walked
off
home
to
chowton
farm
meditating
on
his
own
condition
and
trying
to
make
up
his
mind
to
leave
the
scornful
girl
and
become
a
free
man
but
he
could
do
it
he
could
even
quite
make
up
his
mind
that
he
would
try
to
do
it
there
was
a
bitterness
within
as
he
thought
of
permanent
fixed
failure
which
he
could
not
digest
there
was
a
craving
in
his
heart
which
he
did
not
himself
quite
understand
but
which
made
him
think
that
the
world
would
be
unfit
to
be
lived
in
if
he
were
to
be
altogether
separated
from
mary
masters
he
separate
himself
from
her
it
was
all
very
well
thinking
of
it
talking
of
it
threatening
it
but
in
truth
he
could
do
it
there
might
of
course
be
an
emergency
in
which
he
must
do
it
she
might
declare
that
she
loved
some
one
else
and
she
might
marry
that
other
person
in
that
event
he
saw
no
other
alternative
but
as
he
expressed
it
to
himself
to
run
a
mucker
whether
the
mucker
should
be
run
against
mary
or
against
the
fortunate
lover
or
against
himself
he
did
not
at
present
resolve
but
he
did
resolve
as
he
reached
his
own
that
he
would
make
one
more
passionate
appeal
to
mary
herself
before
she
started
for
cheltenham
and
that
he
would
not
make
it
out
on
a
public
path
or
in
the
masters
family
parlour
before
all
the
masters
family
but
that
he
would
have
her
secluded
by
herself
so
that
he
might
speak
out
all
that
was
in
him
to
the
best
of
his
ability
chapter
xx
there
are
convenances
before
the
monday
came
the
party
to
rufford
hall
had
become
quite
a
settled
thing
and
had
been
very
much
discussed
on
the
saturday
the
senator
had
been
driven
to
the
meet
a
distance
of
about
ten
miles
on
purpose
that
he
might
see
lord
rufford
and
explain
his
views
about
goarly
lord
rufford
had
bowed
and
stared
and
laughed
and
had
then
told
the
senator
that
he
thought
he
would
find
himself
in
the
wrong
box
that
quite
possible
my
lord
i
guess
it
wo
be
the
first
time
i
been
in
the
wrong
box
my
lord
sometimes
i
do
get
right
but
i
thought
i
would
not
enter
your
lordship
house
as
a
guest
without
telling
you
what
i
was
doing
then
lord
rufford
assured
him
that
this
little
affair
about
goarly
would
make
no
difference
in
that
respect
gotobed
again
scrutinised
the
hounds
and
tony
tuppett
laughed
in
his
sleeve
because
a
fox
was
found
in
the
first
quarter
of
an
hour
and
after
that
was
driven
back
to
bragton
the
sunday
was
a
day
of
preparation
for
the
trefoils
of
course
they
did
go
to
church
arabella
indeed
was
never
up
in
time
for
church
and
lady
augustus
only
went
when
her
going
would
be
duly
registered
among
fashionable
people
gotobed
laughed
when
he
was
invited
and
asked
whether
anybody
was
ever
known
to
go
to
church
two
sundays
running
at
bragton
people
have
been
known
to
refuse
with
less
acrimony
said
morton
i
always
speak
my
mind
sir
replied
the
senator
poor
john
morton
therefore
went
to
his
parish
church
alone
there
were
many
things
to
be
considered
by
the
trefoils
there
was
the
question
of
dress
if
any
good
was
to
be
done
by
arabella
at
rufford
it
must
be
done
with
great
despatch
there
would
be
the
dinner
on
monday
the
hunting
on
tuesday
the
ball
and
then
the
interesting
moment
of
departure
no
girl
could
make
better
use
of
her
time
but
then
think
of
her
difficulties
all
that
she
did
would
have
to
be
done
under
the
very
eyes
of
the
man
to
whom
she
was
engaged
and
to
whom
she
wished
to
remain
engaged
unless
as
she
said
to
herself
she
could
pull
off
the
other
event
a
great
deal
must
depend
on
appearance
as
she
and
her
mother
were
out
on
a
lengthened
cruise
among
acquaintances
going
to
the
de
brownes
after
the
gores
and
the
smijthes
after
the
de
brownes
with
as
many
holes
to
run
to
afterwards
as
a
fox
though
with
the
same
probability
of
finding
them
stopped
of
course
she
had
her
wardrobe
with
her
to
see
her
night
after
night
one
would
think
that
it
was
supplied
with
all
that
wealth
would
give
but
there
were
deficiencies
and
there
were
very
well
known
to
herself
and
well
understood
by
her
maid
she
could
generally
supply
herself
with
gloves
by
bets
as
to
which
she
had
never
any
scruple
in
taking
either
what
she
did
win
or
did
not
and
in
dunning
any
who
might
chance
to
be
defaulters
on
occasions
too
when
not
afraid
of
the
bystanders
she
would
venture
on
a
hat
and
though
there
was
difficulty
as
to
the
payment
not
being
able
to
give
her
number
as
she
did
with
gloves
so
that
the
tradesmen
could
send
the
article
still
she
would
manage
to
get
the
hat
and
the
trimmings
it
was
said
of
her
that
she
once
offered
to
lay
an
ulster
to
a
sealskin
jacket
but
that
the
young
man
had
coolly
said
that
a
sealskin
jacket
was
beyond
a
joke
and
had
asked
her
whether
she
was
ready
to
put
down
her
ulster
these
were
little
difficulties
from
which
she
usually
knew
how
to
extricate
herself
without
embarrassment
but
she
had
not
expected
to
have
to
marshal
her
forces
against
such
an
enemy
as
lord
rufford
or
to
sit
down
for
the
besieging
of
such
a
city
this
campaign
there
were
little
things
which
required
to
be
done
and
the
certainly
had
not
time
to
go
to
church
on
sunday
but
there
were
other
things
which
troubled
her
even
more
than
her
clothes
she
did
not
much
like
bragton
and
at
bragton
in
his
own
house
she
did
not
very
much
like
her
proposed
husband
at
washington
he
had
been
somebody
she
had
met
him
everywhere
then
and
had
heard
him
much
talked
about
at
washington
he
had
been
a
popular
man
and
had
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
rich
man
also
but
here
at
home
in
the
country
he
seemed
to
her
to
fall
off
in
importance
and
he
certainly
had
not
made
himself
pleasant
whether
any
man
could
be
pleasant
to
her
in
the
retirement
of
a
country
house
any
man
whom
she
would
have
no
interest
in
running
down
she
did
not
ask
herself
an
engagement
to
her
must
under
any
circumstances
be
a
humdrum
thing
to
be
brightened
only
by
wealth
but
here
she
saw
no
signs
of
wealth
nevertheless
she
was
not
prepared
to
shove
away
the
plank
from
below
her
feet
till
she
was
sure
that
she
had
a
more
substantial
board
on
which
to
step
her
mother
who
perhaps
did
not
see
in
the
character
of
morton
all
the
charms
which
she
would
wish
to
find
in
a
was
anxious
to
shake
off
the
bragton
alliance
but
arabella
as
she
said
so
often
both
to
herself
and
to
her
mother
was
sick
of
the
dust
of
the
battle
and
conscious
of
fading
strength
she
would
make
this
one
more
attempt
but
must
make
it
with
great
care
when
last
in
town
this
young
lord
had
whispered
a
word
or
two
to
her
which
then
had
set
her
hoping
for
a
couple
of
days
and
now
when
chance
had
brought
her
into
his
neighbourhood
he
had
gone
out
of
his
way
very
much
out
of
his
way
to
renew
his
acquaintance
with
her
she
would
be
mad
not
to
give
herself
the
chance
but
yet
she
could
not
afford
to
let
the
plank
go
from
under
her
feet
but
the
part
she
had
to
play
was
one
which
even
she
felt
to
be
almost
beyond
her
powers
she
could
perceive
that
morton
was
beginning
to
be
jealous
and
that
his
jealousy
was
not
of
that
nature
which
strengthens
a
tie
but
which
is
apt
to
break
it
altogether
his
jealousy
if
fairly
aroused
would
not
be
appeased
by
a
final
return
to
himself
she
had
already
given
him
occasion
to
declare
himself
off
and
if
thoroughly
angered
he
would
no
doubt
use
it
day
by
day
and
almost
hour
by
hour
he
was
becoming
more
sombre
and
hard
and
she
was
well
aware
that
there
was
reason
for
it
it
did
not
suit
her
to
walk
about
alone
with
him
through
the
shrubberies
it
did
not
suit
her
to
be
seen
with
his
arm
round
her
waist
of
course
the
people
of
bragton
would
talk
of
the
engagement
but
she
would
prefer
that
they
should
talk
of
it
with
doubt
even
her
own
maid
had
declared
to
hopkins
that
she
did
not
know
whether
there
was
or
was
not
an
engagement
her
own
maid
being
at
the
time
almost
in
her
confidence
very
few
of
the
comforts
of
a
lover
had
been
vouchsafed
to
john
morton
during
this
sojourn
at
bragton
and
very
little
had
been
done
in
accordance
with
his
wishes
even
this
visit
to
rufford
as
she
well
knew
was
being
made
in
opposition
to
him
she
hoped
that
her
lover
would
not
attempt
to
ride
to
hounds
on
the
tuesday
so
that
she
might
be
near
the
lord
unseen
by
him
and
that
he
would
leave
rufford
on
the
wednesday
before
herself
and
her
mother
at
the
ball
of
course
she
could
dance
with
lord
rufford
and
could
keep
her
eye
on
her
lover
at
the
same
time
she
hardly
saw
morton
on
the
sunday
afternoon
and
she
was
again
closeted
on
the
monday
till
lunch
they
were
to
start
at
four
and
there
would
not
be
much
more
than
time
after
lunch
for
her
to
put
on
her
travelling
gear
then
as
they
all
felt
there
was
a
difficulty
about
the
carriages
who
was
to
go
with
whom
arabella
after
lunch
took
the
bull
by
the
horns
i
suppose
she
said
as
morton
followed
her
out
into
the
hall
mamma
and
i
had
better
go
in
the
phaeton
i
was
thinking
that
lady
augustus
might
consent
to
travel
with
gotobed
and
that
you
and
i
might
have
the
phaeton
of
course
it
would
be
very
pleasant
she
answered
smiling
then
why
not
let
it
be
so
there
are
convenances
how
would
it
be
if
you
and
i
were
going
without
anybody
else
do
you
mean
to
say
that
in
that
case
we
might
not
sit
in
the
same
carriage
i
mean
to
say
that
in
that
case
i
should
not
go
at
all
it
done
in
england
you
have
been
in
the
states
so
long
that
you
forget
all
our
ways
i
do
think
that
is
nonsense
she
only
smiled
and
shook
her
head
then
the
senator
shall
go
in
the
phaeton
and
i
will
go
with
you
and
your
mother
yes
and
quarrel
with
mamma
all
the
time
as
you
always
do
let
me
have
it
my
own
way
this
time
upon
my
word
i
believe
you
are
ashamed
of
me
he
said
leaning
back
upon
the
hall
table
he
had
shut
the
door
and
she
was
standing
close
to
him
what
nonsense
you
have
only
got
to
say
so
arabella
and
let
there
be
an
end
of
it
all
if
you
wish
it
mr
morton
you
know
i
do
wish
it
you
know
i
am
ready
to
marry
you
you
have
made
ever
so
many
difficulties
as
far
as
i
can
understand
you
have
unreasonable
people
acting
for
you
arabella
and
of
course
i
do
mean
to
give
way
to
them
pray
do
talk
to
me
about
money
i
know
nothing
about
it
and
have
taken
no
part
in
the
matter
i
suppose
there
must
be
settlements
of
course
there
must
and
i
can
only
do
what
other
people
tell
me
you
at
any
rate
have
something
to
do
with
it
all
and
i
have
absolutely
nothing
that
is
no
reason
you
should
go
in
the
same
carriage
with
me
to
rufford
are
you
coming
back
to
that
just
like
a
big
child
do
let
us
consider
that
as
settled
i
sure
you
let
mamma
and
me
have
the
use
of
the
phaeton
of
course
the
little
contest
was
ended
in
the
manner
proposed
by
arabella
i
do
think
said
arabella
when
she
and
her
mother
were
seated
in
the
carriage
that
we
have
treated
him
very
badly
quite
as
well
as
he
deserves
what
a
house
to
bring
us
to
and
what
people
did
you
ever
come
across
such
an
old
woman
before
and
she
has
him
completely
under
her
thumb
are
you
prepared
to
live
with
that
harridan
you
may
let
me
alone
mamma
for
all
that
she
wo
be
in
my
way
after
i
married
i
can
tell
you
you
have
something
to
do
then
i
ai
a
bit
afraid
of
her
and
to
ask
us
to
meet
such
people
as
this
american
he
going
back
to
washington
and
it
suited
him
to
have
him
i
quarrel
with
him
for
that
i
wish
i
were
married
to
him
and
back
in
the
states
you
do
i
do
you
have
given
it
all
up
about
lord
rufford
then
no
that
just
where
it
is
i
have
given
it
up
and
i
still
see
trouble
upon
trouble
before
me
but
i
know
how
it
will
be
he
mean
anything
he
only
amusing
himself
if
he
once
say
the
word
he
could
get
back
again
the
duke
would
interfere
then
what
would
he
care
for
the
duke
the
duke
is
no
more
than
anybody
else
nowadays
i
shall
just
fall
to
the
ground
between
two
stools
i
know
it
as
well
as
if
it
were
done
already
and
then
i
shall
have
to
begin
again
if
it
comes
to
that
i
shall
do
something
terrible
i
know
i
shall
then
they
turned
in
at
lord
rufford
gates
and
as
they
were
driven
up
beneath
the
oaks
through
the
gloom
both
mother
and
daughter
thought
how
charming
it
would
be
to
be
the
mistress
of
such
a
park
chapter
xxi
the
first
evening
at
rufford
hall
the
phaeton
arrived
the
first
the
driver
having
been
especially
told
by
arabella
that
he
need
not
delay
on
the
road
for
the
other
carriage
she
had
calculated
that
she
might
make
her
entrance
with
better
effect
alone
with
her
mother
than
in
company
with
morton
and
the
senator
it
would
have
been
worth
the
while
of
any
one
who
had
witnessed
her
troubles
on
that
morning
to
watch
the
bland
serenity
and
happy
ease
with
which
she
entered
the
room
her
mother
was
fond
of
a
prominent
place
but
was
quite
contented
on
this
occasion
to
play
a
second
fiddle
for
her
daughter
she
had
seen
at
a
glance
that
rufford
hall
was
a
delightful
house
oh
if
it
might
become
the
home
of
her
child
and
her
grandchildren
and
possibly
a
retreat
for
herself
arabella
was
certainly
very
handsome
at
this
moment
never
did
she
look
better
than
when
got
up
with
care
for
travelling
especially
as
seen
by
an
evening
light
her
slow
motions
were
adapted
to
heavy
wraps
and
however
she
might
procure
her
large
sealskin
jacket
she
graced
it
well
when
she
had
it
lord
rufford
came
to
the
door
to
meet
them
and
immediately
introduced
them
to
his
sister
there
were
six
or
seven
people
in
the
room
mostly
ladies
and
tea
was
offered
to
the
lady
penwether
was
largely
made
like
her
brother
but
was
a
languidly
lovely
woman
not
altogether
unlike
arabella
herself
in
her
figure
and
movements
but
with
a
more
expressive
face
with
less
colour
and
much
more
positive
assurance
of
high
breeding
lady
penwether
was
said
to
be
haughty
but
it
was
admitted
by
all
people
that
when
lady
penwether
had
said
a
thing
or
had
done
a
thing
it
might
be
taken
for
granted
that
the
way
in
which
she
had
done
or
said
that
thing
was
the
right
way
the
only
other
gentleman
there
was
major
caneback
who
had
just
come
in
from
hunting
with
some
distant
pack
and
who
had
been
brought
into
the
room
by
lord
rufford
that
he
might
give
some
account
of
the
doings
of
the
day
according
to
caneback
they
had
been
talking
in
the
brake
country
about
nothing
but
goarly
and
the
enormities
which
had
been
perpetrated
in
the
u
miss
trefoil
said
lord
rufford
what
have
you
done
with
your
senator
he
on
the
road
lord
rufford
examining
english
institutions
as
he
comes
along
he
be
here
by
midnight
imagine
the
man
coming
to
me
and
telling
me
that
he
was
a
friend
of
goarly
i
rather
liked
him
for
it
there
was
a
thorough
pluck
about
it
they
say
he
going
to
find
all
the
money
i
thought
scrobby
was
to
do
that
said
lady
penwether
scrobby
will
not
have
the
slightest
objection
to
have
that
part
of
the
work
done
for
him
if
all
we
hear
is
true
miss
senator
may
have
to
defend
both
scrobby
and
goarly
my
senator
as
you
call
him
will
be
quite
up
to
the
occasion
you
knew
him
in
america
miss
trefoil
asked
lady
penwether
oh
yes
we
used
to
meet
him
and
gotobed
everywhere
but
we
did
exactly
bring
him
over
with
us
though
our
party
down
to
bragton
was
made
up
in
washington
she
added
feeling
that
she
might
in
this
way
account
in
some
degree
for
her
own
presence
in
john
morton
house
it
was
mamma
and
morton
arranged
it
all
oh
my
dear
it
was
you
and
the
senator
said
lady
augustus
ready
for
the
occasion
miss
trefoil
said
the
lord
let
us
have
it
all
out
at
once
are
you
taking
goarly
part
taking
goarly
part
ejaculated
the
major
arabella
affected
to
give
a
little
start
as
though
frightened
by
the
major
enthusiasm
for
heaven
sake
let
us
know
our
foes
continued
lord
rufford
you
see
the
effect
such
an
announcement
had
upon
major
caneback
have
you
made
an
appointment
before
dawn
with
scrobby
under
the
elms
now
i
look
at
you
i
believe
in
my
heart
you
a
goarlyite
only
without
the
senator
courage
to
tell
me
the
truth
beforehand
i
really
am
very
much
obliged
to
goarly
said
arabella
because
it
is
so
nice
to
have
something
to
talk
about
that
just
what
i
think
miss
trefoil
declared
a
young
lady
miss
penge
who
was
a
friend
of
lady
penwether
the
gentlemen
have
so
much
to
say
about
hunting
which
nobody
can
understand
but
now
this
delightful
man
has
scattered
poison
all
over
the
country
there
is
something
that
comes
home
to
our
understanding
i
declare
myself
a
goarlyite
at
once
lord
rufford
and
shall
put
myself
under
the
senator
leading
directly
he
comes
during
all
this
time
not
a
word
had
been
said
of
john
morton
the
master
of
bragton
the
man
to
whose
party
these
belonged
lady
augustus
and
arabella
clearly
understood
that
john
morton
was
only
a
peg
on
which
the
invitation
to
them
had
been
hung
the
feeling
that
it
was
so
grew
upon
them
with
every
word
that
was
spoken
and
also
the
conviction
that
he
must
be
treated
like
a
peg
at
rufford
the
sight
of
the
hangings
of
the
room
so
different
to
the
dingy
curtains
at
bragton
the
brilliancy
of
the
mirrors
all
the
decorations
of
the
place
the
very
blaze
from
the
big
grate
forced
upon
the
girl
feelings
a
conviction
that
this
was
her
proper
sphere
here
she
was
being
made
much
of
as
a
and
here
if
possible
she
must
remain
everything
smiled
on
her
with
gilded
dimples
and
these
were
the
smiles
she
valued
as
the
softness
of
the
cushions
sank
into
her
heart
and
mellow
nothingnesses
from
voices
greeted
her
ears
and
the
air
of
wealth
and
idleness
floated
about
her
cheeks
her
imagination
rose
within
her
and
assured
her
that
she
could
secure
something
better
than
bragton
the
cautions
with
which
she
had
armed
herself
faded
away
this
this
was
the
kind
of
thing
for
which
she
had
been
striving
as
a
girl
of
spirit
was
it
not
worth
her
while
to
make
another
effort
even
though
there
might
be
danger
aut
cæsar
aut
nihil
she
knew
nothing
about
cæsar
but
before
the
tardy
wheels
which
brought
the
senator
and
morton
had
stopped
at
the
door
she
had
declared
to
herself
that
she
would
be
lady
rufford
the
fresh
party
was
of
course
brought
into
the
and
tea
was
offered
but
arabella
hardly
spoke
to
them
and
lady
augustus
did
not
speak
to
them
at
all
and
they
were
shown
up
to
their
bedrooms
with
very
little
preliminary
conversation
it
was
very
hard
to
put
gotobed
down
or
it
might
be
more
correctly
said
as
there
was
no
effort
to
put
him
down
that
it
was
not
often
that
he
failed
in
coming
to
the
surface
he
took
lady
penwether
out
to
dinner
and
was
soon
explaining
to
her
that
this
little
experiment
of
his
in
regard
to
goarly
was
being
tried
simply
with
the
view
of
examining
the
institutions
of
the
country
we
mind
it
from
you
said
lady
penwether
because
you
are
in
a
certain
degree
a
foreigner
the
senator
declared
himself
flattered
by
being
regarded
as
a
foreigner
only
in
a
certain
degree
you
see
you
speak
our
language
gotobed
and
we
ca
help
thinking
you
are
we
are
english
my
lady
said
gotobed
but
then
we
think
the
other
third
is
an
improvement
very
likely
we
have
nothing
so
nice
as
this
as
he
spoke
he
waved
his
right
hand
to
the
different
corners
of
the
room
such
a
as
i
am
sitting
down
to
now
could
be
fixed
in
all
the
united
states
though
a
man
might
spend
three
times
as
many
dollars
on
it
as
his
lordship
does
that
is
very
often
done
i
should
think
but
then
as
we
have
nothing
so
well
done
as
a
house
like
this
so
also
have
we
nothing
so
ill
done
as
the
houses
of
your
poor
people
wages
are
higher
with
you
mr
gotobed
and
public
spirit
and
the
philanthropy
of
the
age
and
the
enlightenment
of
the
people
and
the
institutions
of
the
country
all
round
they
are
all
higher
ducks
said
the
major
who
was
sitting
two
or
three
off
on
the
other
side
yes
sir
we
have
ducks
make
up
for
a
great
many
faults
said
the
major
of
course
sir
when
a
man
stomach
rises
above
his
intelligence
he
have
to
argue
accordingly
said
the
senator
caneback
what
are
you
going
to
ride
asked
the
lord
who
saw
the
necessity
of
changing
the
conversation
as
far
at
least
as
the
major
was
concerned
jemima
mare
of
purefoy
have
my
neck
broken
they
tell
me
it
not
improbable
said
sir
john
purefoy
who
was
sitting
at
lady
penwether
left
hand
nobody
ever
could
ride
her
yet
i
was
thinking
of
asking
you
to
let
miss
trefoil
try
her
said
lord
rufford
arabella
was
sitting
between
sir
john
purefoy
and
the
major
miss
trefoil
is
quite
welcome
said
sir
john
it
is
a
bad
idea
perhaps
she
may
carry
a
lady
because
she
has
never
been
tried
i
know
that
she
objects
strongly
to
carry
a
man
my
dear
said
lady
augustus
you
sha
do
anything
of
the
kind
and
lady
augustus
pretended
to
be
frightened
mamma
you
do
suppose
lord
rufford
wants
to
kill
me
at
once
you
shall
either
ride
her
miss
trefoil
or
my
little
horse
jack
but
i
warn
you
beforehand
that
as
jack
is
the
easiest
ridden
horse
in
the
country
and
can
scramble
over
anything
and
never
came
down
in
his
life
you
wo
get
any
honour
and
glory
but
on
jemima
you
might
make
a
character
that
would
stick
to
you
till
your
dying
day
but
if
i
ride
jemima
that
dying
day
might
be
i
think
take
jack
lord
rufford
and
let
major
caneback
have
the
honour
is
jack
fast
in
this
way
the
anger
arising
between
the
senator
and
the
major
was
assuaged
the
senator
still
held
his
own
and
before
the
question
was
settled
between
jack
and
jemima
had
told
the
company
that
no
englishman
knew
how
to
ride
and
that
the
only
seat
fit
for
a
man
on
horseback
was
that
suited
for
the
pacing
horses
of
california
and
mexico
then
he
assured
sir
john
purefoy
that
eighty
miles
a
day
was
no
great
journey
for
a
pacing
horse
with
a
man
of
fourteen
stone
and
a
saddle
and
accoutrements
weighing
four
more
the
countenance
when
the
senator
declared
that
no
englishman
could
ride
was
a
sight
worth
seeing
that
evening
even
in
the
the
conversation
was
chiefly
about
horses
and
hunting
and
those
terrible
enemies
goarly
and
scrobby
lady
penwether
and
miss
penge
who
did
hunt
were
distantly
civil
to
lady
augustus
of
whom
of
course
a
woman
so
much
in
the
world
as
lady
penwether
knew
something
lady
penwether
had
shrugged
her
shoulders
when
consulted
as
to
these
special
guests
and
had
expressed
a
hope
that
rufford
was
going
to
make
a
goose
of
himself
but
she
was
fond
of
her
brother
and
as
both
lady
purefoy
and
miss
penge
were
special
friends
of
hers
and
as
she
had
also
been
allowed
to
invite
a
couple
of
godolphin
girls
to
whom
she
wished
to
be
civil
she
did
as
she
was
asked
the
girl
she
said
to
miss
penge
that
evening
was
handsome
but
penniless
and
a
flirt
the
mother
she
declared
to
be
a
regular
old
soldier
as
to
lady
augustus
she
was
right
but
she
had
perhaps
failed
to
read
arabella
character
correctly
arabella
trefoil
was
certainly
not
a
flirt
in
all
the
horsey
conversation
arabella
joined
and
her
low
clear
slow
voice
could
be
heard
now
and
then
as
though
she
were
really
animated
with
the
subject
at
bragton
she
had
never
once
spoken
as
though
any
matter
had
interested
her
during
this
time
morton
fell
into
conversation
first
with
lady
purefoy
and
then
with
the
two
miss
godolphins
and
afterwards
for
a
few
minutes
with
lady
penwether
who
knew
that
he
was
a
county
gentleman
and
a
respectable
member
of
the
diplomatic
profession
but
during
the
whole
evening
his
ear
was
intent
on
the
notes
of
arabella
voice
and
also
during
the
whole
evening
her
eye
was
watching
him
she
would
not
lose
her
chance
with
lord
rufford
for
want
of
any
effort
on
her
own
part
if
aught
were
required
from
her
in
her
present
task
that
might
be
offensive
to
morton
anything
that
was
peremptorily
demanded
for
the
effort
she
would
not
scruple
to
offend
the
man
but
if
it
might
be
done
without
offence
so
much
the
better
once
he
came
across
the
room
and
said
a
word
to
her
as
she
was
talking
to
lord
rufford
and
the
purefoys
you
are
really
in
earnest
about
riding
oh
dear
yes
why
should
i
be
in
earnest
you
are
coming
out
yourself
i
hope
said
the
lord
i
have
no
horses
here
of
my
own
but
i
have
told
that
man
stubbings
to
send
me
something
and
as
i
have
been
at
bragton
for
the
last
seven
years
i
have
nothing
proper
to
wear
i
sha
be
called
a
goarlyite
i
hope
if
i
appear
in
trowsers
not
unless
you
have
a
basket
of
red
herrings
on
your
arm
said
lord
rufford
then
morton
retired
back
to
the
miss
godolphins
finding
that
he
had
nothing
more
to
say
to
arabella
he
was
very
angry
though
he
hardly
knew
why
or
with
whom
a
girl
when
she
is
engaged
is
not
supposed
to
talk
to
no
one
but
her
recognised
lover
in
a
mixed
party
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
and
she
is
especially
absolved
from
such
a
duty
when
they
chance
to
meet
in
the
house
of
a
comparative
stranger
in
such
a
house
and
among
such
people
it
was
natural
that
the
talk
should
be
about
hunting
and
as
the
girl
had
accepted
the
loan
of
a
horse
it
was
natural
that
she
should
join
in
such
conversation
she
had
never
sat
for
a
moment
apart
with
lord
rufford
it
was
impossible
to
say
that
she
had
flirted
with
the
man
and
yet
morton
felt
that
he
was
neglected
and
felt
also
that
he
was
only
there
because
this
young
lord
had
liked
to
have
in
his
house
the
handsome
girl
whom
he
morton
intended
to
marry
he
felt
thoroughly
ashamed
of
being
there
as
it
were
in
the
train
of
miss
trefoil
he
was
almost
disposed
to
get
up
and
declare
that
the
girl
was
engaged
to
marry
him
he
thought
that
he
could
put
an
end
to
the
engagement
without
breaking
his
heart
but
if
the
engagement
was
an
engagement
he
could
not
submit
to
treatment
such
as
this
either
from
her
or
from
others
he
would
see
her
for
the
last
time
in
the
country
at
the
ball
on
the
following
evening
as
of
course
he
would
not
be
near
her
during
the
hunting
and
then
he
would
make
her
understand
that
she
must
be
altogether
his
or
altogether
cease
to
be
his
and
so
resolving
he
went
to
bed
refusing
to
join
the
gentlemen
in
the
oh
mamma
arabella
said
to
her
mother
that
evening
i
do
so
wish
i
could
break
my
arm
break
your
arm
my
dear
or
my
leg
would
be
better
i
wish
i
could
have
the
courage
to
chuck
myself
off
going
over
some
gate
if
i
could
be
laid
up
here
now
with
a
broken
limb
i
really
think
i
could
do
it
chapter
xxii
jemima
as
the
meet
on
the
next
morning
was
in
the
park
the
party
at
rufford
hall
was
able
to
enjoy
the
luxury
of
an
easy
morning
together
with
the
pleasures
of
the
field
there
was
no
getting
up
at
eight
no
hurry
and
scurry
to
do
twenty
miles
and
yet
be
in
time
no
necessity
for
the
tardy
dressers
to
swallow
their
breakfasts
while
their
more
energetic
companions
were
raving
at
them
for
compromising
the
chances
of
the
day
by
their
delay
there
was
a
public
breakfast
at
which
all
the
hunting
farmers
of
the
country
were
to
be
seen
and
some
who
only
pretended
to
be
hunting
farmers
on
such
occasions
but
there
was
a
private
breakfast
for
the
ladies
and
such
of
the
gentlemen
as
preferred
tea
to
champagne
and
cherry
brandy
lord
rufford
was
in
and
out
of
both
rooms
making
himself
generally
agreeable
in
the
public
room
there
was
a
great
deal
said
about
goarly
to
all
of
which
the
senator
listened
with
eager
ears
for
the
senator
preferred
the
public
breakfast
as
offering
another
institution
to
his
notice
he
swing
on
a
gallows
afore
he
dead
said
one
energetic
farmer
who
was
sitting
next
to
gotobed
a
fat
man
with
a
round
head
and
a
bullock
neck
dressed
in
a
black
coat
with
breeches
and
john
runce
was
not
a
riding
man
he
was
too
heavy
and
too
fond
of
his
beer
and
port
wine
but
he
was
a
hunting
man
all
over
one
who
always
had
a
fox
in
the
springs
at
the
bottom
of
his
big
meadows
one
to
whom
it
was
the
very
breath
of
his
nostrils
to
shake
hands
with
the
hunting
gentry
and
to
be
known
as
a
staunch
friend
to
the
u
a
man
did
not
live
in
the
county
more
respected
than
john
runce
or
who
was
better
able
to
pay
his
way
to
his
thinking
an
animal
more
injurious
than
goarly
to
the
best
interests
of
civilisation
could
not
have
been
produced
by
all
the
evil
influences
of
the
world
combined
do
you
really
think
said
the
senator
calmly
that
a
man
should
be
hanged
for
killing
a
fox
john
runce
who
was
not
very
ready
turned
round
and
stared
at
him
i
have
heard
of
any
other
harm
that
he
has
done
and
perhaps
he
had
some
provocation
for
that
words
were
wanting
to
runce
but
not
indignation
he
collected
together
his
plate
and
knife
and
fork
and
his
two
glasses
and
his
lump
of
bread
and
looking
the
senator
full
in
the
face
slowly
pushed
back
his
chair
and
carrying
his
provisions
with
him
toddled
off
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
when
he
reached
a
spot
where
place
was
made
for
him
he
had
hardly
breath
left
to
speak
well
he
said
i
never
he
sat
a
minute
in
silence
shaking
his
head
and
continued
to
shake
his
head
and
look
round
upon
his
neighbours
as
he
devoured
his
food
there
was
a
very
cosy
party
who
came
in
by
degrees
lady
penwether
was
there
soon
after
ten
with
miss
penge
and
some
of
the
gentlemen
including
morton
who
was
the
only
man
seen
in
that
room
in
black
young
hampton
who
was
intimate
in
the
house
made
his
way
up
there
and
sir
john
purefoy
joined
the
party
sir
john
was
a
hunting
man
who
lived
in
the
county
and
was
an
old
friend
of
the
family
lady
purefoy
hunted
also
and
came
in
later
arabella
was
the
last
not
from
laziness
but
aware
that
in
this
way
the
effect
might
be
the
best
lord
rufford
was
in
the
room
when
she
entered
it
and
of
course
she
addressed
herself
to
him
which
is
it
to
be
lord
rufford
jack
or
jemima
which
ever
you
like
i
am
quite
indifferent
if
you
put
me
on
the
mare
i
ride
her
or
try
indeed
you
wo
said
lady
augustus
mamma
knows
nothing
about
it
lord
rufford
i
believe
i
could
do
just
as
well
as
major
caneback
she
never
had
a
lady
on
her
in
her
life
said
sir
john
then
it
time
for
her
to
begin
but
at
any
rate
i
must
have
some
breakfast
first
then
lord
rufford
brought
her
a
cup
of
tea
and
sir
john
gave
her
a
cutlet
and
she
felt
herself
to
be
happy
she
was
quite
content
with
her
hat
and
though
her
habit
was
not
exactly
a
hunting
habit
it
fitted
her
well
morton
had
never
before
seen
her
in
a
riding
dress
and
acknowledged
that
it
became
her
he
struggled
to
think
of
something
special
to
say
to
her
but
there
was
nothing
he
was
not
at
home
on
such
an
occasion
his
long
trowsers
weighed
him
down
and
his
ordinary
morning
coat
cowed
him
he
knew
in
his
heart
that
she
thought
nothing
of
him
as
he
was
now
but
she
said
a
word
to
him
with
that
usual
smile
of
hers
of
course
morton
you
are
coming
with
us
a
little
way
perhaps
you
find
that
any
horse
from
stubbings
can
go
said
lord
rufford
i
wish
i
could
say
as
much
of
all
mine
jack
can
go
i
hope
lord
rufford
lord
rufford
nodded
his
head
and
i
shall
expect
you
to
give
me
a
lead
to
this
he
assented
though
it
was
perhaps
more
than
he
had
intended
but
on
such
an
occasion
it
is
almost
impossible
to
refuse
such
a
request
at
eleven
they
were
all
out
in
the
park
and
tony
was
elate
as
a
prince
having
been
regaled
with
a
tumbler
of
champagne
but
the
great
interest
of
the
immediate
moment
were
the
frantic
efforts
made
by
jemima
to
get
rid
of
her
rider
once
or
twice
sir
john
asked
the
major
to
give
it
up
but
the
major
swore
that
the
mare
was
a
good
mare
and
only
wanted
riding
she
kicked
and
squealed
and
backed
and
went
round
the
park
with
him
at
a
full
gallop
in
the
park
there
was
a
rail
with
a
ditch
and
the
major
rode
her
at
it
in
a
gallop
she
went
through
the
timber
fell
in
the
ditch
and
then
was
brought
up
again
without
giving
the
man
a
fall
he
at
once
put
her
back
at
the
same
fence
and
she
took
it
almost
in
her
stride
without
touching
it
have
her
like
a
spaniel
before
the
day
over
said
the
major
who
thoroughly
enjoyed
these
little
encounters
among
the
laurels
at
the
bottom
of
the
park
a
fox
was
found
and
then
there
was
a
great
deal
of
riding
about
the
grounds
all
this
was
much
enjoyed
by
the
ladies
who
were
on
foot
and
by
the
senator
who
wandered
about
the
place
alone
a
gentleman
park
is
not
always
the
happiest
place
for
finding
a
fox
the
animal
has
usually
many
resources
there
and
does
not
like
to
leave
it
and
when
he
does
go
away
it
is
not
always
easy
to
get
after
him
but
ladies
in
a
carriage
or
on
foot
on
such
occasions
have
their
turn
of
the
sport
on
this
occasion
it
was
nearly
one
before
the
fox
allowed
himself
to
be
killed
and
then
he
had
hardly
been
outside
the
park
palings
there
was
a
good
deal
of
sherry
drank
before
the
party
got
away
and
hunting
men
such
as
major
caneback
began
to
think
that
the
day
was
to
be
thrown
away
as
they
started
off
for
shugborough
springs
the
little
covert
on
john
runce
farm
which
was
about
four
miles
from
rufford
hall
sir
john
asked
the
major
to
get
on
another
animal
you
had
trouble
enough
with
her
for
one
day
and
given
her
enough
to
do
but
the
major
was
not
of
that
way
of
thinking
let
her
have
the
work
said
the
major
do
her
good
remember
what
she
learned
and
so
they
trotted
off
to
shugborough
while
they
were
riding
about
the
park
morton
had
kept
near
to
miss
trefoil
lord
rufford
being
on
his
own
place
and
among
his
own
coverts
had
had
cares
on
his
hand
and
been
unable
to
devote
himself
to
the
young
lady
she
had
never
for
a
moment
looked
up
at
her
lover
or
tried
to
escape
from
him
she
had
answered
all
his
questions
saying
however
very
little
and
had
bided
her
time
the
more
gracious
she
was
to
morton
now
the
less
ground
would
he
have
for
complaining
of
her
when
she
should
leave
him
as
they
were
trotting
along
the
road
lord
rufford
came
up
and
apologized
afraid
i
been
very
inattentive
miss
trefoil
but
i
dare
say
you
been
in
better
hands
there
has
been
much
to
do
has
there
very
little
i
suppose
a
man
is
responsible
for
having
foxes
that
wo
break
did
you
see
the
senator
he
seemed
to
think
it
was
all
right
did
you
hear
of
john
runce
then
he
told
the
story
of
john
runce
which
had
been
told
to
him
what
a
fine
old
fellow
i
should
forgive
him
his
rent
he
is
much
better
able
to
pay
me
double
your
senator
morton
is
a
very
peculiar
man
he
is
peculiar
said
morton
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
can
make
himself
very
disagreeable
we
might
as
well
trot
on
as
shugborough
is
a
small
place
and
a
fox
always
goes
away
from
it
at
once
john
runce
knows
how
to
train
them
better
than
i
do
then
they
made
their
way
on
through
the
straggling
horses
and
john
morton
not
wishing
to
seem
to
be
afraid
of
his
rival
remained
alone
i
wish
caneback
had
left
that
mare
behind
said
the
lord
as
they
went
it
is
the
country
for
her
and
she
is
going
very
nastily
with
him
are
you
fond
of
hunting
miss
trefoil
very
fond
of
it
said
arabella
who
had
been
out
two
or
three
times
in
her
life
i
like
a
girl
to
ride
to
hounds
said
his
lordship
i
do
think
she
ever
looks
so
well
then
arabella
determined
that
come
what
might
she
would
ride
to
hounds
at
shugborough
springs
a
fox
was
found
before
half
the
field
was
up
and
he
broke
almost
as
soon
as
he
was
found
follow
me
through
the
handgates
said
the
lord
and
from
the
third
field
out
it
fair
riding
let
him
have
his
head
and
remember
he
hangs
a
moment
as
he
comes
to
his
fence
you
wo
be
left
behind
unless
there
something
out
of
the
way
to
stop
us
arabella
heart
was
in
her
mouth
but
she
was
quite
resolved
where
he
went
she
would
follow
as
for
being
left
behind
she
would
not
care
the
least
for
that
if
he
were
left
behind
with
her
they
got
well
away
having
to
pause
a
moment
while
the
hounds
came
up
to
tony
horn
out
of
the
wood
then
there
was
plain
sailing
and
there
were
very
few
before
them
he
one
of
the
old
sort
my
lord
said
tony
as
he
pressed
on
speaking
of
the
fox
not
too
near
me
and
you
go
like
a
bird
said
his
lordship
he
a
nice
little
horse
is
he
when
i
going
to
be
married
he
be
the
first
present
i
shall
make
her
he
tempt
almost
any
girl
said
arabella
it
was
wonderful
how
well
she
went
knowing
so
little
about
it
as
she
did
the
horse
was
one
easily
ridden
and
on
plain
ground
she
knew
what
she
was
about
in
a
saddle
at
any
rate
she
did
not
disgrace
herself
and
when
they
had
already
run
some
three
or
four
miles
lord
rufford
had
nearly
the
best
of
it
and
she
had
kept
with
him
you
do
know
where
you
are
i
suppose
he
said
when
they
came
to
a
check
and
i
do
in
the
least
care
if
they
only
go
on
said
she
eagerly
we
back
at
rufford
park
we
left
the
road
nearly
a
mile
to
our
left
but
there
we
are
those
trees
are
the
park
but
must
we
stop
there
that
as
the
fox
may
choose
to
behave
we
sha
stop
unless
he
does
then
young
hampton
came
up
declaring
that
there
was
the
very
mischief
going
on
between
major
caneback
and
jemima
according
to
hampton
account
the
major
had
been
down
three
or
four
times
but
was
determined
to
break
either
the
mare
neck
or
her
spirit
he
had
been
considerably
hurt
so
hampton
said
in
one
shoulder
but
had
insisted
on
riding
on
that
the
worst
of
him
said
lord
rufford
he
never
knows
when
to
give
up
then
the
hounds
were
again
on
the
scent
and
were
running
very
fast
towards
the
park
that
a
nasty
ditch
before
us
said
the
lord
come
down
a
little
to
the
left
the
hounds
are
heading
that
way
and
there
a
gate
young
hampton
in
the
meantime
was
going
straight
for
the
fence
i
not
afraid
said
arabella
very
well
give
him
his
head
and
he
do
it
just
at
that
moment
there
was
a
noise
behind
them
and
the
major
on
jemima
rushed
up
she
was
covered
with
foam
and
he
with
dirt
and
her
sides
were
sliced
with
the
spur
his
hat
was
crushed
and
he
was
riding
almost
altogether
with
his
right
hand
he
came
close
to
arabella
and
she
could
see
the
rage
in
his
face
as
the
animal
rushed
on
with
her
head
almost
between
her
knees
he
have
another
fall
there
said
lord
rufford
hampton
who
had
passed
them
was
the
first
over
the
fence
and
the
other
three
all
took
it
abreast
the
major
was
to
the
right
the
lord
to
the
left
and
the
girl
between
them
the
mare
head
was
perhaps
the
first
she
rushed
at
the
fence
made
no
leap
at
all
and
of
course
went
headlong
into
the
ditch
the
major
still
stuck
to
her
though
two
or
three
voices
implored
him
to
get
off
he
afterwards
declared
that
he
had
not
strength
to
lift
himself
out
of
the
saddle
the
mare
lay
for
a
moment
then
blundered
out
rolled
over
him
jumped
on
to
her
feet
and
lunging
out
kicked
her
rider
on
the
head
as
he
was
rising
then
she
went
away
and
afterwards
jumped
the
palings
into
rufford
park
that
evening
she
was
shot
the
man
when
kicked
had
fallen
back
close
under
the
feet
of
miss
trefoil
horse
she
screamed
and
fell
also
but
fell
without
hurting
herself
lord
rufford
of
course
stopped
as
did
also
hampton
and
one
of
the
whips
with
several
others
in
the
course
of
a
minute
or
two
the
major
was
senseless
but
they
who
understood
what
they
were
looking
at
were
afraid
that
the
case
was
very
bad
he
was
picked
up
and
put
on
a
door
and
within
half
an
hour
was
on
his
bed
in
rufford
hall
but
he
did
not
speak
for
some
hours
and
before
six
that
evening
the
doctor
from
rufford
had
declared
that
he
had
mounted
his
last
horse
and
ridden
his
last
hunt
oh
lord
rufford
said
arabella
i
shall
never
recover
that
i
heard
the
horse
feet
against
his
head
lord
rufford
shuddered
and
put
his
hand
round
her
waist
to
support
her
at
that
time
they
were
standing
on
the
ground
do
mind
me
if
you
can
do
any
good
to
him
but
there
was
nothing
that
lord
rufford
could
do
as
four
men
were
carrying
the
major
on
a
shutter
so
he
and
arabella
returned
together
and
when
she
got
off
her
horse
she
was
only
able
to
throw
herself
into
his
arms
chapter
xxiii
poor
caneback
a
closer
intimacy
will
occasionally
be
created
by
some
accident
some
fortuitous
circumstance
than
weeks
of
ordinary
intercourse
will
produce
walk
down
bond
street
in
a
hailstorm
of
peculiar
severity
and
you
may
make
a
friend
of
the
first
person
you
meet
whereas
you
would
be
held
to
have
committed
an
affront
were
you
to
speak
to
the
same
person
in
the
same
place
on
a
fine
day
you
shall
travel
smoothly
to
york
with
a
lady
and
she
will
look
as
though
she
would
call
the
guard
at
once
were
you
so
much
as
to
suggest
that
it
were
a
fine
day
but
if
you
are
lucky
enough
to
break
a
wheel
before
you
get
to
darlington
she
will
have
told
you
all
her
history
and
shared
your
sherry
by
the
time
you
have
reached
that
town
arabella
was
very
much
shocked
by
the
dreadful
accident
she
had
seen
her
nerves
had
suffered
though
it
may
be
doubted
whether
her
heart
had
been
affected
much
but
she
was
quite
conscious
when
she
reached
her
room
that
the
poor
major
misfortune
happening
as
it
had
done
just
beneath
her
horse
feet
had
been
a
godsend
to
her
for
a
moment
the
young
lord
arm
had
been
round
her
waist
and
her
head
had
been
upon
his
shoulder
and
again
when
she
had
slipped
from
her
saddle
she
had
felt
his
embrace
his
fervour
to
her
had
been
simply
the
uncontrolled
expression
of
his
feeling
at
the
moment
as
one
man
squeezes
another
tightly
by
the
hand
in
any
crisis
of
sudden
impulse
she
knew
this
but
she
knew
also
that
he
would
probably
revert
to
the
intimacy
which
the
sudden
emotion
had
created
the
mutual
galvanic
shock
might
be
continued
at
the
next
meeting
and
so
on
they
had
seen
the
tragedy
together
and
it
would
not
fail
to
be
a
bond
of
union
as
she
told
the
tragedy
to
her
mother
she
delicately
laid
aside
her
hat
and
whip
and
riding
dress
and
then
asked
whether
it
was
not
possible
that
they
might
prolong
their
stay
at
rufford
but
the
gores
my
dear
i
put
them
off
you
know
for
two
days
only
then
arabella
declared
that
she
did
not
care
a
straw
for
the
gores
in
such
a
matter
as
this
what
would
it
signify
though
they
should
quarrel
with
a
whole
generation
of
gores
for
some
time
she
thought
that
she
would
not
come
down
again
that
afternoon
or
even
that
evening
it
might
well
be
that
the
sight
of
the
accident
should
have
made
her
too
ill
to
appear
she
felt
conscious
that
in
that
moment
and
in
the
subsequent
half
hour
she
had
carried
herself
well
and
that
there
would
be
an
interest
about
her
were
she
to
own
herself
compelled
to
keep
her
room
were
she
now
to
take
to
her
bed
they
could
not
turn
her
out
on
the
following
day
but
at
last
her
counsel
put
an
end
to
that
plan
time
was
too
precious
i
think
you
might
lose
more
than
you
gain
said
her
mother
both
lord
rufford
and
his
sister
were
very
much
disturbed
as
to
what
they
should
do
on
the
occasion
at
six
lord
rufford
was
told
that
the
major
had
recovered
his
senses
but
that
the
case
was
almost
hopeless
of
course
he
saw
his
guest
i
all
right
said
the
major
the
lord
sat
there
by
the
bedside
holding
the
man
hand
for
a
few
moments
and
then
got
up
to
leave
him
no
nonsense
about
putting
off
said
the
major
in
a
faint
voice
beastly
bosh
all
that
but
what
was
to
be
done
the
dozen
people
who
were
in
the
house
must
of
course
sit
down
to
dinner
and
then
all
the
neighbourhood
for
miles
round
were
coming
to
a
ball
it
would
be
impossible
to
send
messages
to
everybody
and
there
was
the
feeling
too
that
the
man
was
as
yet
only
ill
and
that
his
recovery
was
possible
a
ball
with
a
dead
man
in
one
of
the
bedrooms
would
be
dreadful
with
a
dying
man
it
was
bad
enough
but
then
a
dying
man
is
always
also
a
living
man
lord
rufford
had
already
telegraphed
for
a
surgeon
from
london
it
having
been
whispered
to
him
that
perhaps
old
nokes
from
rufford
might
be
mistaken
the
surgeon
could
not
be
there
till
four
in
the
morning
by
which
time
care
would
have
been
taken
to
remove
the
signs
of
the
ball
but
if
there
was
reason
to
send
for
a
london
surgeon
then
also
was
there
reason
for
hope
and
if
there
were
ground
for
hope
then
the
desirability
of
putting
off
the
ball
was
very
much
reduced
he
at
the
furthest
end
of
the
corridor
the
lord
said
to
his
sister
and
wo
hear
a
sound
of
the
music
though
the
man
were
to
die
why
should
the
people
dance
had
the
major
been
dying
three
or
four
miles
off
at
the
hotel
at
rufford
there
would
only
have
been
a
few
sad
looks
a
few
shakings
of
the
head
and
the
people
would
have
danced
without
any
flaw
in
their
gaiety
had
it
been
known
at
rufford
hall
that
he
was
lying
at
that
moment
in
his
mortal
agony
at
aberdeen
an
exclamation
or
two
poor
caneback
poor
major
would
have
been
the
extent
of
the
wailing
and
not
the
pressure
of
a
lover
hand
would
have
been
lightened
or
the
note
of
a
fiddle
delayed
and
nobody
in
that
house
really
cared
much
for
caneback
he
was
not
a
man
worthy
of
much
care
he
was
possessed
of
infinite
pluck
and
now
that
he
was
dying
could
bear
it
well
but
he
had
loved
no
one
particularly
had
been
dear
to
no
one
in
these
latter
days
of
his
life
had
been
of
very
little
use
in
the
world
and
had
done
very
little
more
for
society
than
any
other
but
nevertheless
it
is
a
bore
when
a
gentleman
dies
in
your
house
and
a
worse
bore
if
he
dies
from
an
accident
than
from
an
illness
for
which
his
own
body
may
be
supposed
to
be
responsible
though
the
gout
should
fly
to
a
man
stomach
in
your
best
bedroom
the
idea
never
strikes
you
that
your
burgundy
has
done
it
but
here
the
mare
had
done
the
mischief
poor
caneback
and
poor
lord
rufford
the
major
was
quite
certain
that
it
was
all
over
with
himself
he
had
broken
so
many
of
his
bones
and
had
his
head
so
often
cracked
that
he
understood
his
own
anatomy
pretty
well
there
he
lay
quiet
and
composed
sipping
small
modicums
of
brandy
and
water
and
taking
his
outlook
into
such
transtygian
world
as
he
had
fashioned
for
himself
in
his
dull
imagination
if
he
had
misgivings
he
showed
them
to
no
bystander
if
he
thought
then
that
he
might
have
done
better
with
his
energies
than
devote
them
to
dangerous
horses
he
never
said
so
his
voice
was
weak
but
it
never
quailed
and
the
only
regret
he
expressed
was
that
he
had
not
changed
the
bit
in
jemima
mouth
lord
rufford
position
was
made
worse
by
an
expression
from
sir
john
purefoy
that
the
party
ought
to
be
put
off
sir
john
was
in
a
measure
responsible
for
what
his
mare
had
done
and
was
in
a
wretched
state
if
it
could
possibly
affect
the
poor
fellow
i
would
do
it
said
lord
rufford
but
it
would
create
very
great
inconvenience
and
disappointment
i
have
to
think
of
other
people
then
i
shall
send
my
wife
home
said
sir
john
and
lady
purefoy
was
sent
home
sir
john
himself
of
course
could
not
leave
the
house
while
the
man
was
alive
before
they
all
sat
down
to
dinner
the
major
was
declared
to
be
a
little
stronger
that
settled
the
question
and
the
ball
was
not
put
off
the
ladies
came
down
to
dinner
in
a
melancholy
guise
they
were
not
fully
dressed
for
the
evening
and
were
of
course
inclined
to
be
silent
and
sad
before
lord
rufford
came
in
arabella
managed
to
get
herself
on
to
the
sofa
next
to
lady
penwether
and
then
to
undergo
some
little
hysterical
manifestation
oh
lady
penwether
if
you
had
seen
it
and
heard
it
i
am
very
glad
that
i
was
spared
anything
so
horrible
and
the
man
face
as
he
passed
me
going
to
the
leap
it
will
haunt
me
to
my
dying
day
then
she
shivered
and
gurgled
in
her
throat
and
turning
suddenly
round
hid
her
face
on
the
elbow
of
the
couch
i
been
afraid
all
the
afternoon
that
she
would
be
ill
whispered
lady
augustus
to
miss
penge
she
is
so
susceptible
when
lord
rufford
came
into
the
room
arabella
at
once
got
up
and
accosted
him
with
a
whisper
either
he
took
her
or
she
took
him
into
a
distant
part
of
the
room
where
they
conversed
apart
for
five
minutes
and
he
as
he
told
her
how
things
were
going
and
what
was
being
done
bent
over
her
and
whispered
also
what
good
would
it
do
you
know
she
said
with
affected
intimacy
as
he
spoke
of
his
difficulty
about
the
ball
one
would
do
anything
if
one
could
be
of
service
but
that
would
do
nothing
she
felt
completely
that
her
presence
at
the
accident
had
given
her
a
right
to
have
peculiar
conversations
and
to
be
consulted
about
everything
of
course
she
was
very
sorry
for
major
caneback
but
as
it
had
been
ordained
that
major
caneback
was
to
have
his
head
split
in
two
by
a
kick
from
a
horse
and
that
lord
rufford
was
to
be
there
to
see
it
how
great
had
been
the
blessing
which
had
brought
her
to
the
spot
at
the
same
time
everybody
there
saw
the
intimacy
and
most
of
them
understood
the
way
in
which
it
was
being
used
that
girl
is
very
clever
rufford
his
sister
whispered
to
him
before
dinner
she
is
very
much
excited
rather
than
clever
just
at
present
he
answered
upon
which
lady
penwether
shook
her
head
miss
penge
whispered
to
miss
godolphin
that
miss
trefoil
was
making
the
most
of
it
and
morton
who
had
come
into
the
room
while
the
conversation
apart
was
going
on
had
certainly
been
of
the
same
opinion
she
had
seated
herself
in
an
away
from
the
others
after
that
conversation
was
over
and
as
she
sat
there
morton
came
up
to
her
he
had
been
so
little
intimate
with
the
members
of
the
party
assembled
and
had
found
himself
so
much
alone
that
he
had
only
lately
heard
the
story
about
major
caneback
and
had
now
only
heard
it
imperfectly
but
he
did
see
that
an
absolute
intimacy
had
been
effected
where
two
days
before
there
had
only
been
a
slight
acquaintance
and
he
believed
that
this
sudden
rush
had
been
in
some
way
due
to
the
accident
of
which
he
had
been
told
you
know
what
has
happened
he
said
oh
morton
do
not
talk
to
me
about
it
were
you
not
speaking
of
it
to
lord
rufford
of
course
i
was
we
were
together
did
you
see
it
then
she
shuddered
put
her
handkerchief
up
to
her
eyes
and
turned
her
face
away
and
yet
the
ball
is
to
go
on
he
asked
pray
pray
do
not
dwell
on
it
unless
you
wish
to
force
me
back
to
my
room
when
i
left
it
i
felt
that
i
was
attempting
to
do
too
much
this
might
have
been
all
very
well
had
she
not
been
so
manifestly
able
to
talk
to
lord
rufford
on
the
same
subject
if
there
is
any
young
man
to
whom
a
girl
should
be
able
to
speak
when
she
is
in
a
state
of
violent
emotion
it
is
the
young
man
to
whom
she
is
engaged
so
at
least
thought
john
morton
then
dinner
was
announced
and
the
dinner
certainly
was
sombre
enough
a
dinner
before
a
ball
in
the
country
never
is
very
much
of
a
dinner
the
ladies
know
that
there
is
work
before
them
and
keep
themselves
for
the
greater
occasion
lady
purefoy
had
gone
and
lady
penwether
was
not
very
happy
in
the
prospects
for
the
evening
neither
miss
penge
nor
either
of
the
two
miss
godolphins
had
entertained
personal
hopes
in
regard
to
lord
rufford
but
nevertheless
they
took
badly
the
great
favour
shown
to
arabella
lady
augustus
did
not
get
on
particularly
well
with
any
of
the
other
ladies
and
there
seemed
during
the
dinner
to
be
an
air
of
unhappiness
over
them
all
they
retired
as
soon
as
it
was
possible
and
then
arabella
at
once
went
up
to
her
bedroom
nokes
says
he
is
a
little
stronger
my
lord
said
the
butler
coming
into
the
room
nokes
had
gone
home
and
had
returned
again
he
might
pull
through
yet
said
hampton
lord
rufford
shook
his
head
then
gotobed
told
a
wonderful
story
of
an
american
who
had
had
his
brains
knocked
almost
out
of
his
head
and
had
sat
in
congress
afterwards
he
was
the
finest
horseman
i
ever
saw
on
a
horse
said
hampton
a
little
too
much
temper
said
captain
battersby
who
was
a
very
old
friend
of
the
major
i
give
a
good
deal
that
that
mare
had
never
been
brought
to
my
stables
said
lord
rufford
purefoy
will
never
get
over
it
and
i
sha
forget
it
in
a
hurry
sir
john
at
this
time
was
with
the
sufferer
even
while
drinking
their
wine
they
could
not
keep
themselves
from
the
subject
and
were
convivial
in
a
cadaverous
fashion
chapter
xxiv
the
ball
the
people
came
of
course
but
not
in
such
numbers
as
had
been
expected
many
of
those
in
rufford
had
heard
of
the
accident
and
having
been
made
acquainted
with
nokes
report
stayed
away
everybody
was
told
that
supper
would
be
on
the
table
at
twelve
and
that
it
was
generally
understood
that
the
house
was
to
be
cleared
by
two
nokes
seemed
to
think
that
the
sufferer
would
live
at
least
till
the
morrow
and
it
was
ascertained
to
a
certainty
that
the
music
could
not
affect
him
it
was
agreed
among
the
party
in
the
house
that
the
ladies
staying
there
should
stand
up
for
the
first
dance
or
two
as
otherwise
the
strangers
would
be
discouraged
and
the
whole
thing
would
be
a
failure
this
request
was
made
by
lady
penwether
because
miss
penge
had
said
that
she
thought
it
impossible
for
her
to
dance
poor
miss
penge
who
was
generally
regarded
as
a
brilliant
young
woman
had
been
a
good
deal
eclipsed
by
arabella
and
had
seen
the
necessity
of
striking
out
some
line
for
herself
then
arabella
had
whispered
a
few
words
to
lord
rufford
and
the
lord
had
whispered
a
few
words
to
his
sister
and
lady
penwether
had
explained
what
was
to
be
done
to
the
ladies
around
lady
augustus
nodded
her
head
and
said
that
it
was
all
right
the
other
ladies
of
course
agreed
and
partners
were
selected
within
the
house
party
lord
rufford
stood
up
with
arabella
and
john
morton
with
lady
penwether
gotobed
selected
miss
penge
and
hampton
and
battersby
the
two
miss
godolphins
they
all
took
their
places
with
a
lugubrious
but
air
as
aware
that
they
were
sacrificing
themselves
in
the
performance
of
a
sad
duty
but
morton
was
not
allowed
to
dance
in
the
same
quadrille
with
the
lady
of
his
affections
lady
penwether
explained
to
him
that
she
and
her
brother
had
better
divide
themselves
for
the
good
of
the
company
generally
and
therefore
he
and
arabella
were
also
divided
a
rumour
had
reached
lady
penwether
of
the
truth
in
regard
to
their
guests
from
bragton
gotobed
had
whispered
to
her
that
he
had
understood
that
they
certainly
were
engaged
and
even
before
that
the
names
of
the
two
lovers
had
been
wafted
to
her
ears
from
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
both
john
morton
and
lady
augustus
were
somebodies
and
lady
penwether
generally
knew
what
there
was
to
be
known
of
anybody
who
was
anybody
but
it
was
quite
clear
to
her
more
so
even
than
to
poor
john
morton
that
the
lady
was
conducting
herself
now
as
though
she
were
fettered
by
no
bonds
and
it
seemed
to
lady
penwether
also
that
the
lady
was
very
anxious
to
contract
other
bonds
she
knew
her
brother
well
he
was
always
in
love
with
somebody
but
as
he
had
hitherto
failed
of
success
where
marriage
was
desirable
so
had
he
avoided
disaster
when
it
was
not
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
are
generally
supposed
to
be
averse
to
matrimony
lady
penwether
and
some
other
relatives
were
anxious
that
he
should
take
a
wife
but
his
sister
was
by
no
means
anxious
that
he
should
take
such
a
one
as
arabella
trefoil
therefore
she
thought
that
she
might
judiciously
ask
morton
a
few
questions
i
believe
you
knew
the
trefoils
in
washington
she
said
morton
acknowledged
that
he
had
seen
much
of
them
there
she
is
very
handsome
certainly
i
think
so
and
rides
well
i
suppose
i
do
know
i
never
heard
much
of
her
riding
has
she
been
staying
long
at
bragton
just
a
week
do
you
know
lord
augustus
morton
said
that
he
did
not
know
lord
augustus
and
then
answered
sundry
other
questions
of
the
same
nature
in
the
same
uncommunicative
way
though
he
had
once
or
twice
almost
fancied
that
he
would
like
to
proclaim
aloud
that
the
girl
was
engaged
to
him
yet
he
did
not
like
to
have
the
fact
pumped
out
of
him
and
if
she
were
such
a
girl
as
she
now
appeared
to
be
might
it
not
be
better
for
him
to
let
her
go
surely
her
conduct
here
at
rufford
hall
was
opportunity
enough
no
doubt
she
was
handsome
no
doubt
he
loved
her
after
his
fashion
of
loving
but
to
lose
her
now
would
not
break
his
heart
whereas
to
lose
her
after
he
was
married
to
her
would
he
knew
well
bring
him
to
the
very
ground
he
would
ask
her
a
question
or
two
this
very
night
and
then
come
to
some
resolution
with
such
thoughts
as
these
crossing
his
mind
he
certainly
was
not
going
to
proclaim
his
engagement
to
lady
penwether
but
lady
penwether
was
a
determined
woman
her
smile
when
she
condescended
to
smile
was
very
sweet
lighting
up
her
whole
face
and
flattering
for
the
moment
the
person
on
whom
it
shone
it
was
as
though
a
rose
in
emitting
its
perfume
could
confine
itself
to
the
nostrils
of
its
one
favoured
friend
and
now
she
smiled
on
morton
as
she
asked
another
question
i
did
hear
she
said
from
one
of
your
foreign
office
young
men
that
you
and
miss
trefoil
were
very
intimate
who
was
that
lady
penwether
of
course
i
shall
mention
no
name
you
might
call
out
the
poor
lad
and
shoot
him
or
worse
still
have
him
put
down
to
the
bottom
of
his
class
but
i
did
hear
it
and
then
when
i
find
her
staying
with
her
mother
at
your
house
of
course
i
believe
it
to
be
true
now
she
is
staying
at
your
brother
house
which
is
much
the
same
thing
but
i
am
here
and
my
grandmother
is
at
bragton
that
puts
me
in
mind
morton
i
am
so
sorry
that
we
did
not
know
it
so
that
we
might
have
asked
her
she
never
goes
out
anywhere
lady
penwether
and
there
is
nothing
then
in
the
report
that
i
heard
morton
paused
a
moment
before
he
answered
and
during
that
moment
collected
his
diplomatic
resources
he
was
not
a
weak
man
who
could
be
made
to
tell
anything
by
the
wiles
of
a
pretty
woman
i
think
he
said
that
when
people
have
anything
of
that
kind
which
they
wish
to
be
known
they
declare
it
i
beg
your
pardon
i
did
not
mean
to
unravel
a
secret
there
are
secrets
lady
penwether
which
people
do
like
to
unravel
but
which
the
owners
of
them
sometimes
wo
abandon
then
there
was
nothing
more
said
on
the
subject
lady
penwether
did
not
smile
again
and
left
him
to
go
about
the
room
on
her
business
as
hostess
as
soon
as
the
dance
was
over
but
she
was
sure
that
they
were
engaged
in
the
meantime
the
conversation
between
lord
rufford
and
arabella
was
very
different
in
its
tone
though
on
the
same
subject
he
was
certainly
very
much
struck
with
her
not
probably
ever
waiting
to
declare
to
himself
that
she
was
the
most
beautiful
woman
he
had
ever
seen
in
his
life
but
still
feeling
towards
her
an
attraction
which
for
the
time
was
strong
a
very
clever
girl
would
frighten
him
a
very
horsey
girl
would
disgust
him
a
very
quiet
girl
would
bore
him
or
a
very
noisy
girl
annoy
him
with
a
shy
girl
he
could
never
be
at
his
ease
not
enjoying
the
labour
of
overcoming
such
a
barrier
and
yet
he
liked
to
be
able
to
feel
that
any
female
intimacy
which
he
admitted
was
due
to
his
own
choice
and
not
to
that
of
the
young
woman
arabella
trefoil
was
not
very
clever
but
she
had
given
all
her
mind
to
this
peculiar
phase
of
life
and
to
use
a
common
phrase
knew
what
she
was
about
she
was
quite
alive
to
the
fact
that
different
men
require
different
manners
in
a
young
woman
and
as
she
had
adapted
herself
to
morton
at
washington
so
could
she
at
rufford
adapt
herself
to
lord
rufford
at
the
present
moment
the
lord
was
in
love
with
her
as
much
as
he
was
wont
to
be
in
love
it
seem
an
immense
time
since
we
came
here
yesterday
she
said
to
him
there
has
been
so
much
done
there
has
been
a
great
misfortune
i
suppose
that
is
it
only
for
that
how
very
very
pleasant
it
would
have
been
yes
indeed
it
was
a
nice
run
and
that
little
horse
carried
you
charmingly
i
wish
i
could
see
you
ride
him
again
she
shook
her
head
as
she
looked
up
into
his
face
why
do
you
shake
your
head
because
i
am
afraid
there
is
no
possible
chance
of
such
happiness
we
are
going
to
such
a
dull
house
and
then
to
so
many
dull
houses
afterwards
i
do
know
why
you
should
come
back
and
have
another
day
or
two
when
all
this
sadness
has
gone
by
do
talk
about
it
lord
rufford
why
not
i
never
like
to
talk
about
any
pleasure
because
it
always
vanishes
as
soon
as
it
has
come
and
when
it
has
been
real
pleasure
it
never
comes
back
again
i
do
think
i
ever
enjoyed
anything
so
much
as
our
ride
this
morning
till
that
tragedy
came
poor
caneback
i
suppose
there
is
no
hope
he
shook
his
head
and
we
must
go
on
to
those
gores
without
knowing
anything
about
it
i
wonder
whether
you
could
send
me
a
line
of
course
i
can
and
i
will
then
he
asked
her
a
question
looking
into
her
face
you
are
not
going
back
to
bragton
oh
dear
no
was
bragton
dull
awfully
dull
frightfully
dull
you
know
what
they
say
what
who
say
lord
rufford
people
say
anything
the
more
the
better
they
like
it
i
think
have
you
not
heard
what
they
say
about
you
and
mr
morton
just
because
mamma
made
a
promise
when
in
washington
to
go
to
bragton
with
that
gotobed
do
you
find
they
marry
you
to
everybody
they
have
married
me
to
a
good
many
people
perhaps
they
marry
me
to
you
that
would
not
be
so
bad
oh
lord
rufford
nobody
has
ever
condemned
you
to
anything
so
terrible
as
that
there
was
no
truth
in
it
then
miss
trefoil
none
at
all
lord
rufford
only
i
do
know
why
you
should
ask
me
well
i
do
know
a
man
likes
sometimes
to
be
sure
how
the
land
lies
morton
looks
so
cross
that
i
thought
that
perhaps
the
very
fact
of
my
dancing
with
you
might
be
an
offence
is
he
cross
you
know
him
better
than
i
do
perhaps
it
his
nature
now
i
must
do
one
other
dance
with
a
native
and
then
my
work
will
be
over
that
is
very
civil
lord
rufford
if
you
do
not
know
what
i
meant
you
not
the
girl
i
take
you
to
be
then
as
she
walked
with
him
back
out
of
the
into
the
she
assured
him
that
she
did
know
what
he
meant
and
that
therefore
she
was
the
girl
he
took
her
to
be
she
had
determined
that
she
would
not
dance
again
and
had
resolved
to
herd
with
the
other
ladies
of
the
house
waiting
for
any
opportunity
that
chance
might
give
her
for
having
a
last
word
with
lord
rufford
before
they
parted
for
the
night
when
morton
came
up
to
her
and
demanded
rather
than
asked
that
she
would
stand
up
with
him
for
a
quadrille
we
settled
it
all
among
ourselves
you
know
she
said
we
were
to
dance
only
once
just
to
set
the
people
off
he
still
persisted
but
she
still
refused
alleging
that
she
was
bound
by
the
general
compact
and
though
he
was
very
urgent
she
would
not
yield
i
wonder
how
you
can
ask
me
she
said
you
do
suppose
that
after
what
has
occurred
i
can
have
any
pleasure
in
dancing
upon
this
he
asked
her
to
take
a
turn
with
him
through
the
rooms
and
to
that
she
found
herself
compelled
to
assent
then
he
spoke
out
to
her
arabella
he
said
i
am
not
quite
content
with
what
has
been
going
on
since
we
came
to
this
house
i
am
sorry
for
that
nor
indeed
have
i
been
made
very
happy
by
all
that
has
occurred
since
your
mother
and
you
did
me
the
honour
of
coming
to
bragton
i
must
acknowledge
you
have
seemed
to
be
very
happy
mr
morton
i
do
want
to
distress
you
and
as
far
as
possible
i
wish
to
avoid
distressing
myself
if
it
is
your
wish
that
our
engagement
should
be
over
i
will
endeavour
to
bear
it
if
it
is
to
be
continued
i
expect
that
your
manner
to
me
should
be
altered
what
am
i
to
say
say
what
you
feel
i
feel
that
i
ca
alter
my
manner
as
you
call
it
you
do
wish
the
engagement
to
be
over
then
i
did
not
say
so
the
truth
is
morton
that
there
is
some
trouble
about
the
lawyers
why
do
you
always
call
me
mr
morton
because
i
am
aware
how
probable
it
is
that
all
this
may
come
to
nothing
i
ca
walk
out
of
the
house
and
marry
you
as
the
cookmaid
does
the
gardener
i
got
to
wait
till
i
told
that
everything
is
settled
and
at
present
i
told
that
things
are
not
settled
because
you
wo
agree
i
leave
it
to
anybody
to
say
whether
i
been
unreasonable
i
wo
go
into
that
i
have
meddled
with
it
and
i
do
know
anything
about
it
but
until
it
is
all
settled
as
a
matter
of
course
there
must
be
some
little
distance
between
us
it
the
commonest
thing
in
the
world
i
should
say
what
is
to
be
the
end
of
it
i
do
not
know
if
you
think
yourself
injured
you
can
back
out
of
it
at
once
i
nothing
more
to
say
about
it
and
you
think
i
can
like
the
way
you
going
on
here
if
you
jealous
morton
there
an
end
of
it
i
tell
you
fairly
once
for
all
that
as
long
as
i
a
single
woman
i
will
regulate
my
conduct
as
i
please
you
can
do
the
same
and
i
shall
not
say
a
word
to
you
then
she
withdrew
her
arm
from
him
and
leaving
him
walked
across
the
room
and
joined
her
mother
he
went
off
at
once
to
his
own
room
resolving
that
he
would
write
to
her
from
bragton
he
had
made
his
propositions
in
regard
to
money
which
he
was
quite
aware
were
as
liberal
as
was
fit
if
she
would
now
fix
a
day
for
their
marriage
he
would
be
a
happy
man
if
she
would
not
bring
herself
to
do
this
then
he
would
have
no
alternative
but
to
regard
their
engagement
as
at
an
end
at
two
the
guests
were
nearly
all
gone
the
major
was
alive
and
likely
to
live
at
least
for
some
hours
and
the
rufford
people
generally
were
glad
that
they
had
not
put
off
the
ball
some
of
them
who
were
staying
in
the
house
had
already
gone
to
bed
and
lady
penwether
with
miss
penge
at
her
side
was
making
her
last
adieux
in
the
the
was
reached
from
the
with
a
vestibule
between
them
and
opening
from
this
was
a
small
chamber
prettily
furnished
but
seldom
used
which
had
no
peculiar
purpose
of
its
own
but
in
which
during
the
present
evening
many
sweet
words
had
probably
been
spoken
now
at
this
last
moment
lord
rufford
and
arabella
trefoil
were
there
alone
together
she
had
just
got
up
from
a
sofa
and
he
had
taken
her
hand
in
his
she
did
not
attempt
to
withdraw
it
but
stood
looking
down
upon
the
ground
then
he
passed
his
arm
round
her
waist
and
lifting
her
face
to
his
held
her
in
a
close
embrace
from
which
she
made
no
effort
to
free
herself
as
soon
as
she
was
released
she
hastened
to
the
door
which
was
all
but
closed
and
as
she
opened
it
and
passed
through
to
the
said
some
ordinary
word
to
him
quite
aloud
in
her
ordinary
voice
if
his
action
had
disturbed
her
she
knew
very
well
how
to
recover
her
equanimity
chapter
xxv
the
last
morning
at
rufford
hall
well
my
love
said
lady
augustus
as
soon
as
her
daughter
had
joined
her
in
her
bedroom
on
such
occasions
there
was
always
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
going
to
bed
in
which
the
mother
and
daughter
discussed
their
affairs
while
the
two
lady
maids
were
discussing
their
affairs
in
the
other
room
the
two
maids
probably
did
not
often
quarrel
but
the
mother
and
daughter
usually
did
i
wish
that
stupid
man
had
got
himself
hurt
of
course
my
dear
we
all
wish
that
but
i
really
do
see
that
it
has
stood
much
in
your
way
yes
it
has
after
all
there
is
nothing
like
dancing
and
we
should
all
have
been
sent
to
bed
at
two
then
it
has
come
to
nothing
i
did
say
that
at
all
mamma
i
think
i
have
done
uncommonly
well
indeed
i
know
i
have
but
then
if
everything
had
not
been
upset
i
might
have
done
so
much
better
what
have
you
done
asked
lady
augustus
timidly
she
knew
perfectly
well
that
her
daughter
would
tell
her
nothing
and
yet
she
always
asked
these
questions
and
was
always
angry
when
no
information
was
given
to
her
any
young
woman
would
have
found
it
very
hard
to
give
the
information
needed
when
we
were
alone
he
sat
for
five
minutes
with
his
arm
round
my
waist
and
then
he
kissed
me
he
say
much
but
then
i
knew
perfectly
well
that
he
would
be
on
his
guard
not
to
commit
himself
by
words
but
i
got
him
to
promise
that
he
write
to
me
and
of
course
i
answer
in
such
a
way
that
he
must
write
again
i
know
he
want
to
see
me
and
i
think
i
can
go
very
near
doing
it
but
he
an
old
stager
and
knows
what
about
and
of
course
there
be
ever
so
many
people
to
tell
him
not
the
sort
of
girl
he
ought
to
marry
he
hear
about
colonel
de
b
and
sir
d
and
lord
f
and
there
are
ever
so
many
chances
against
me
but
i
made
up
my
mind
to
try
it
taking
the
long
odds
i
can
hardly
expect
to
win
but
if
i
do
pull
it
off
i
made
for
ever
a
daughter
can
hardly
say
all
that
to
her
mother
even
arabella
trefoil
could
not
say
it
to
her
mother
or
at
any
rate
she
would
not
what
a
question
that
is
to
ask
mamma
she
did
say
tossing
her
head
well
my
dear
unless
you
tell
me
something
how
can
i
help
you
i
do
know
that
i
want
you
to
help
me
at
any
rate
not
in
that
way
in
what
way
oh
mamma
you
are
so
odd
has
he
said
anything
yes
he
has
he
said
he
liked
dry
champagne
and
that
he
never
ate
supper
if
you
wo
tell
me
how
things
are
going
you
may
fight
your
own
battles
by
yourself
that
just
what
i
must
do
nobody
else
can
fight
my
battles
for
me
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
mr
morton
nothing
i
saw
him
talking
to
you
and
looking
as
black
as
thunder
he
always
looks
as
black
as
thunder
is
that
to
be
all
off
i
insist
upon
having
an
answer
to
that
question
i
believe
you
fancy
mamma
that
a
lot
of
men
can
be
played
like
a
parcel
of
chessmen
and
that
as
soon
as
a
knight
is
knocked
on
the
head
you
can
take
him
up
and
put
him
into
the
box
and
have
done
with
him
you
have
done
with
morton
then
poor
morton
i
do
feel
he
is
badly
used
because
he
is
so
honest
i
sometimes
wish
that
i
could
afford
to
be
honest
too
and
to
tell
somebody
the
downright
truth
i
should
like
to
tell
him
the
truth
and
i
almost
think
i
will
dear
fellow
i
did
for
a
time
think
i
could
do
better
and
i
not
at
all
sure
now
that
i
can
but
then
you
are
so
very
dull
and
i
not
certain
that
i
should
care
to
be
queen
of
the
english
society
at
the
court
of
the
emperor
of
morocco
but
if
you
wait
for
another
six
months
i
shall
be
able
to
tell
you
that
what
i
should
have
to
say
to
him
who
is
talking
nonsense
now
arabella
i
am
not
but
i
sha
say
it
and
now
mamma
i
tell
you
what
we
must
do
you
must
tell
me
why
also
i
can
do
nothing
of
the
kind
he
knows
the
duke
the
duke
with
the
trefoils
always
meant
the
duke
of
mayfair
who
was
arabella
ducal
uncle
intimately
well
enough
to
go
there
there
is
to
be
a
great
shooting
at
mistletoe
mistletoe
was
the
duke
place
in
january
i
got
that
from
him
and
he
can
go
if
he
likes
he
wo
go
as
it
is
but
if
i
tell
him
i
to
be
there
i
think
he
will
what
did
you
tell
him
well
i
told
him
a
tarradiddle
of
course
i
made
him
understand
that
i
could
be
there
if
i
pleased
and
he
thinks
that
i
mean
to
be
there
if
he
goes
but
i
sure
the
duchess
wo
have
me
again
she
might
let
me
come
and
what
am
i
to
do
you
could
go
to
brighton
with
miss
de
groat
or
what
does
it
matter
for
a
fortnight
you
get
the
advantage
when
it
done
it
as
well
to
have
the
truth
out
at
once
mamma
i
can
not
carry
on
if
always
to
be
stuck
close
to
your
there
are
so
many
people
wo
have
you
arabella
i
do
think
you
are
the
most
ungrateful
creature
that
ever
lived
very
well
i
do
know
what
i
have
to
be
grateful
about
and
i
need
to
be
of
course
i
am
the
thing
will
be
to
get
papa
to
see
his
brother
your
papa
yes
that
what
i
mean
to
try
the
duke
of
course
would
like
me
to
marry
lord
rufford
do
you
think
that
if
i
were
at
home
here
it
would
make
mistletoe
a
very
different
sort
of
place
for
you
the
duke
does
like
papa
in
a
sort
of
way
and
he
civil
enough
to
me
when
i
there
he
never
did
like
you
everybody
is
so
fond
of
you
it
was
what
you
did
when
young
stranorlar
was
there
which
made
the
duchess
almost
turn
us
out
of
the
house
what
the
good
of
your
saying
that
mamma
if
you
go
on
like
that
i
separate
myself
from
you
and
throw
myself
on
papa
your
father
would
lift
his
little
finger
for
you
i
try
at
any
rate
will
you
consent
to
my
going
there
without
you
if
i
can
manage
it
what
did
lord
rufford
say
arabella
here
made
a
grimace
you
can
tell
me
something
what
are
the
lawyers
to
say
to
people
whatever
they
like
if
they
come
to
arrangements
do
you
mean
to
marry
him
not
for
the
next
two
months
certainly
i
sha
see
him
again
now
heaven
knows
when
he
write
no
doubt
one
of
his
awfully
sensible
letters
and
i
shall
take
my
time
about
answering
him
i
can
stretch
it
out
for
two
months
if
i
to
do
any
good
with
this
man
it
will
be
all
arranged
before
that
time
if
the
duke
could
really
be
made
to
believe
that
lord
rufford
was
in
earnest
i
sure
he
have
me
there
as
to
her
she
always
does
what
he
tells
her
he
is
going
to
write
to
you
i
told
you
that
before
mamma
what
is
the
good
of
asking
a
lot
of
questions
you
know
now
what
my
plan
is
and
if
you
wo
help
me
i
must
carry
it
out
alone
and
remember
i
do
want
to
start
till
after
morton
and
that
american
have
gone
then
without
a
kiss
or
wishing
her
mother
good
night
she
went
off
to
her
own
room
the
next
morning
at
about
nine
arabella
heard
from
her
maid
that
the
major
was
still
alive
but
senseless
the
london
surgeon
had
been
there
and
had
declared
it
to
be
possible
that
the
patient
should
live
but
barely
possible
at
ten
they
were
all
at
breakfast
and
the
carriage
from
bragton
was
already
at
the
door
to
take
back
morton
and
his
american
friend
lady
augustus
had
been
clever
enough
to
arrange
that
she
should
have
the
phaeton
to
take
her
to
the
rufford
station
a
little
later
on
in
the
day
and
had
already
hinted
to
one
of
the
servants
that
perhaps
a
cart
might
be
sent
with
the
luggage
the
cart
was
forthcoming
lady
augustus
was
very
clever
in
arranging
her
locomotion
and
seldom
paid
for
much
more
than
her
railway
tickets
i
had
meant
to
say
a
few
words
to
you
my
lord
about
that
man
goarly
said
the
senator
standing
before
the
fire
in
the
but
this
sad
catastrophe
has
stopped
me
there
is
much
to
say
about
him
mr
gotobed
perhaps
not
only
i
would
not
wish
you
to
think
that
i
would
oppose
you
without
some
cause
if
the
man
is
in
the
wrong
according
to
law
let
him
be
proved
to
be
so
the
cost
to
you
will
be
nothing
to
him
it
might
be
of
considerable
importance
just
so
wo
you
sit
down
and
have
some
breakfast
if
goarly
ever
makes
himself
nuisance
enough
it
may
be
worth
my
while
to
buy
him
out
at
three
times
the
value
of
his
land
but
he
have
to
be
a
very
great
nuisance
before
i
shall
do
that
dillsborough
wood
is
not
the
only
fox
covert
in
the
county
after
that
there
was
no
more
said
about
it
but
neither
did
lord
rufford
understand
the
senator
nor
did
the
senator
understand
lord
rufford
john
runce
had
a
clearer
conviction
on
his
mind
than
either
of
them
goarly
ought
to
be
hanged
and
no
american
should
under
any
circumstances
be
allowed
to
put
his
foot
upon
british
soil
that
was
runce
idea
of
the
matter
the
parting
between
morton
and
the
trefoils
was
very
chill
and
uncomfortable
morton
we
had
such
a
pleasant
time
at
bragton
said
lady
augustus
i
shall
write
to
you
this
afternoon
he
whispered
to
arabella
as
he
took
her
hand
she
smiled
and
murmured
a
word
of
adieu
but
made
him
no
reply
then
they
were
gone
and
as
he
got
into
the
carriage
he
told
himself
that
in
all
probability
he
would
never
see
her
again
it
might
be
that
he
would
curtail
his
leave
of
absence
and
get
back
to
washington
as
quickly
as
possible
the
trefoils
did
not
start
for
an
hour
after
this
during
which
arabella
could
hardly
find
an
opportunity
for
a
word
in
private
she
could
not
quite
appeal
to
him
to
walk
with
her
in
the
grounds
or
even
to
take
a
turn
with
her
round
the
empty
she
came
down
dressed
for
walking
thinking
that
so
she
might
have
the
best
chance
of
getting
him
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
herself
but
he
was
either
too
wary
or
else
the
habits
of
his
life
prevented
it
and
in
what
she
had
to
do
it
was
so
easy
to
go
beyond
the
proper
line
she
would
wish
him
to
understand
that
she
would
like
to
be
alone
with
him
after
what
had
passed
between
them
on
the
previous
evening
but
she
must
be
careful
not
to
let
him
imagine
that
she
was
too
anxious
and
then
whatever
she
did
she
had
to
do
with
so
many
eyes
upon
her
and
when
she
went
as
she
would
do
now
in
so
short
a
time
so
many
hostile
tongues
would
attack
her
he
had
everything
to
protect
him
and
she
had
nothing
absolutely
nothing
to
help
her
it
was
thus
that
she
looked
at
it
and
yet
she
had
courage
for
the
battle
almost
at
the
last
moment
she
did
get
a
word
with
him
in
the
hall
how
is
he
oh
better
decidedly
i
am
so
glad
if
i
could
only
think
that
he
could
live
well
my
lord
we
have
to
say
i
suppose
so
you
write
me
a
line
about
him
certainly
i
shall
be
so
glad
to
have
a
line
from
rufford
maddox
hall
you
know
stafford
i
will
remember
and
dear
old
jack
tell
me
when
you
write
what
jack
has
been
doing
then
she
put
out
her
hand
and
he
held
it
i
wonder
whether
you
will
ever
remember
but
she
did
not
quite
know
what
to
bid
him
remember
and
therefore
turned
away
her
face
and
wiped
away
a
tear
and
then
smiled
as
she
turned
her
back
on
him
the
carriage
was
at
the
door
and
the
ladies
flocked
into
the
hall
and
then
not
another
word
could
be
said
that
what
i
call
a
really
nice
country
house
said
lady
augustus
as
she
was
driven
away
arabella
sat
back
in
the
phaeton
lost
in
thought
and
said
nothing
everything
so
well
done
and
yet
none
of
all
that
fuss
that
there
is
at
mistletoe
she
paused
but
still
her
daughter
did
not
speak
if
i
were
beginning
the
world
again
i
would
not
wish
for
a
better
establishment
than
that
why
ca
you
answer
me
a
word
when
i
speak
to
you
of
course
it
all
very
nice
what
the
good
of
going
on
in
that
way
what
a
shame
it
is
that
a
man
like
that
should
have
so
much
and
that
a
girl
like
me
should
have
nothing
at
all
i
know
twice
as
much
as
he
does
and
am
twice
as
clever
and
yet
i
got
to
treat
him
as
though
he
were
a
god
he
all
very
well
but
what
would
anybody
think
of
him
if
he
were
a
younger
brother
with
a
year
this
was
a
kind
of
philosophy
which
lady
augustus
hated
she
threw
herself
back
therefore
in
the
phaeton
and
pretended
to
go
to
sleep
the
wheels
were
not
out
of
sight
of
the
house
before
the
attack
on
the
trefoils
began
i
had
heard
of
lady
augustus
before
said
lady
penwether
but
i
did
think
that
any
woman
could
be
so
disagreeable
so
vulgar
said
miss
penge
was
she
the
daughter
of
an
ironmonger
asked
the
elder
miss
godolphin
the
girl
of
course
is
handsome
said
lady
penwether
but
so
said
miss
godolphin
and
almost
as
vulgar
as
her
mother
said
miss
penge
she
may
be
clever
said
lady
penwether
but
i
do
not
think
i
should
ever
like
her
she
is
one
of
those
girls
whom
only
gentlemen
like
said
miss
penge
and
whom
they
do
like
very
long
said
lady
penwether
how
well
i
understand
all
this
said
lord
rufford
turning
to
the
younger
miss
godolphin
it
is
all
said
for
my
benefit
and
considered
to
be
necessary
because
i
danced
with
the
young
lady
last
night
i
hope
you
are
not
attributing
such
a
motive
to
me
said
miss
penge
or
to
me
said
miss
godolphin
i
look
on
both
of
you
and
eleanor
as
all
one
on
the
present
occasion
i
am
considered
to
be
falling
over
a
precipice
and
she
has
got
hold
of
my
coat
tails
of
course
you
would
be
christians
if
you
did
both
of
you
seize
a
foot
looking
at
it
in
that
light
i
certainly
wish
to
be
understood
as
holding
on
very
fast
said
miss
penge
chapter
xxvi
give
me
six
months
there
was
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
some
very
genuine
sorrow
in
the
attorney
house
at
dillsborough
during
the
first
week
in
december
masters
had
declared
to
his
wife
that
mary
should
go
to
cheltenham
and
a
letter
was
written
to
lady
ushant
accepting
the
invitation
the
too
was
forthcoming
and
the
dress
and
the
boots
and
the
hat
were
bought
but
while
this
was
going
on
masters
took
care
that
there
should
be
no
comfort
whatever
around
them
and
made
every
meal
a
separate
curse
to
the
unfortunate
lawyer
she
told
him
ten
times
a
day
that
she
had
been
a
mother
to
his
daughter
but
declared
that
such
a
position
was
no
longer
possible
to
her
as
the
girl
had
been
taken
altogether
out
of
her
hands
to
mary
she
hardly
spoke
at
all
and
made
her
thoroughly
wish
that
lady
ushant
kindness
had
been
declined
mamma
she
said
one
day
i
had
rather
write
now
and
tell
her
that
i
can
not
come
after
all
the
money
has
been
wasted
i
have
only
got
things
that
i
must
have
had
very
soon
if
you
have
got
anything
to
say
you
had
better
talk
to
your
father
i
know
nothing
about
it
you
break
my
heart
when
you
say
that
mamma
you
think
nothing
about
breaking
mine
or
that
young
who
is
behaving
so
well
to
you
what
makes
me
mad
is
to
see
you
with
him
mamma
i
have
that
what
i
call
it
why
ca
you
speak
him
fair
and
tell
him
you
have
him
and
settle
yourself
down
properly
you
got
some
idea
into
your
silly
head
that
what
you
call
a
gentleman
will
come
after
you
mamma
that
is
fair
very
well
miss
as
your
father
takes
your
part
of
course
you
can
say
what
you
please
to
me
i
say
it
is
so
mary
knew
very
well
what
her
mother
meant
and
was
safe
at
least
from
any
allusion
to
reginald
morton
there
was
an
idea
prevalent
in
the
house
and
not
without
some
cause
that
surtees
the
curate
had
looked
with
an
eye
of
favour
on
mary
masters
surtees
was
certainly
a
gentleman
but
his
income
was
strictly
limited
to
the
sum
of
per
annum
which
he
received
from
mainwaring
now
masters
disliked
clergymen
disliked
gentlemen
and
especially
disliked
poverty
and
therefore
was
not
disposed
to
look
upon
surtees
as
an
eligible
suitor
for
her
stepdaughter
but
as
the
curate
courtship
had
hitherto
been
of
the
coldest
kind
and
as
it
had
received
no
encouragement
from
the
young
lady
mary
was
certainly
justified
in
declaring
that
the
allusion
was
not
fair
what
i
want
to
know
is
this
are
you
prepared
to
marry
lawrence
twentyman
to
this
question
as
mary
could
not
give
a
favourable
answer
she
thought
it
best
to
make
none
at
all
there
is
a
man
as
has
got
a
house
fit
for
any
woman
and
means
to
keep
it
who
can
give
a
young
woman
everything
that
she
ought
to
want
and
a
handsome
fellow
too
with
some
life
in
him
one
who
really
dotes
on
you
as
men
do
often
do
on
young
women
now
as
far
as
i
can
see
i
wonder
what
it
is
you
would
have
i
want
nothing
mamma
yes
you
do
you
have
been
reading
books
of
poetry
till
you
know
what
it
is
you
do
want
you
got
your
head
full
of
claptraps
and
tantrums
till
you
have
a
grain
of
sense
belonging
to
you
i
hate
such
ways
it
a
spurning
of
the
gifts
of
providence
not
to
have
such
a
man
as
lawrence
twentyman
when
he
comes
in
your
way
who
are
you
i
wonder
that
you
should
be
contented
with
such
as
him
he
go
and
take
some
one
else
and
then
you
be
fit
to
break
your
heart
fretting
after
him
and
i
sha
pity
you
a
bit
it
serve
you
right
and
you
die
an
old
maid
and
what
there
will
be
for
you
to
live
upon
god
in
heaven
only
knows
you
breaking
your
heart
as
it
is
then
she
sat
down
in
a
and
throwing
her
apron
over
her
eyes
gave
herself
up
to
a
deluge
of
hysterical
tears
this
was
very
hard
upon
mary
for
though
she
did
not
believe
all
the
horrible
things
which
her
stepmother
said
to
her
she
did
believe
some
of
them
she
was
not
afraid
of
the
fate
of
an
old
maid
which
was
threatened
but
she
did
think
that
her
marriage
with
this
man
would
be
for
the
benefit
of
the
family
and
a
great
relief
to
her
father
and
she
knew
too
that
he
was
respectable
and
believed
him
to
be
thoroughly
earnest
in
his
love
for
such
love
as
that
it
is
impossible
that
a
girl
should
not
be
grateful
there
was
nothing
to
allure
him
nothing
to
tempt
him
to
such
a
marriage
but
a
simple
appreciation
of
her
personal
merits
and
in
life
he
was
at
any
rate
her
equal
she
had
told
reginald
morton
that
larry
twentyman
was
a
fit
companion
for
her
and
for
her
sisters
and
she
owned
as
much
to
herself
every
day
when
she
acknowledged
all
this
she
was
tempted
to
ask
herself
whether
she
ought
not
to
accept
the
man
if
not
for
her
own
sake
at
least
for
that
of
the
family
that
same
evening
her
father
called
her
into
the
office
after
the
clerks
were
gone
and
spoke
to
her
thus
your
mamma
is
very
unhappy
my
dear
he
said
i
afraid
i
have
made
everybody
unhappy
by
wanting
to
go
to
cheltenham
it
is
not
only
that
that
is
reasonable
enough
and
you
ought
to
go
mamma
would
say
nothing
more
about
that
if
you
would
make
up
your
mind
to
one
thing
what
thing
papa
of
course
she
knew
very
well
what
the
thing
was
it
is
time
for
you
to
think
of
settling
in
life
mary
i
never
would
put
it
into
a
girl
head
that
she
ought
to
worry
herself
about
getting
a
husband
unless
the
opportunity
seemed
to
come
in
her
way
young
women
should
be
quiet
and
wait
till
they
sought
after
but
here
is
a
young
man
seeking
you
whom
we
all
like
and
approve
a
good
house
is
a
very
good
thing
when
it
fairly
come
by
yes
papa
and
so
is
a
full
house
a
girl
should
run
after
money
but
plenty
is
a
great
comfort
in
this
world
when
it
can
be
had
without
blushing
for
yes
papa
and
so
is
an
honest
man
love
i
do
like
to
see
any
girl
wearying
after
some
fellow
to
be
always
with
her
a
good
girl
will
be
able
to
be
happy
and
contented
without
that
but
a
lone
life
is
a
poor
life
and
a
good
husband
is
about
the
best
blessing
that
a
young
woman
can
have
to
this
proposition
mary
perhaps
agreed
in
her
own
mind
but
she
gave
no
spoken
assent
now
this
young
man
that
is
wanting
to
marry
you
has
got
all
these
things
and
as
far
as
i
can
judge
with
my
experience
in
the
world
is
as
likely
to
make
a
good
husband
as
any
one
i
know
he
paused
for
an
answer
but
mary
could
only
lean
close
upon
his
arm
and
be
silent
have
you
anything
to
say
about
it
my
dear
you
see
it
has
been
going
on
now
a
long
time
and
of
course
he
look
to
have
it
decided
but
still
she
could
say
nothing
well
now
he
has
been
with
me
mr
twentyman
yes
twentyman
he
knows
you
going
to
cheltenham
and
of
course
he
has
nothing
to
say
against
that
no
young
man
such
as
he
would
be
sorry
that
his
sweetheart
should
be
entertained
by
such
a
lady
as
lady
ushant
but
he
says
that
he
wants
to
have
an
answer
before
you
go
i
did
answer
him
papa
yes
you
refused
him
but
he
hopes
that
perhaps
you
may
think
better
of
it
he
has
been
with
me
and
i
have
told
him
that
if
he
will
come
you
will
see
him
he
is
to
be
here
after
dinner
and
you
had
better
just
take
him
and
hear
what
he
has
to
say
if
you
can
make
up
your
mind
to
like
him
you
will
please
all
your
family
but
if
you
ca
i
wo
quarrel
with
you
my
dear
oh
papa
you
are
always
so
good
of
course
i
am
anxious
that
you
should
have
a
home
of
your
own
but
let
it
be
how
it
may
i
will
not
quarrel
with
my
child
all
that
evening
and
almost
all
the
night
and
again
on
the
following
morning
mary
turned
it
over
in
her
mind
she
was
quite
sure
that
she
was
not
in
love
with
larry
twentyman
but
she
was
by
no
means
sure
that
it
might
not
be
her
duty
to
accept
him
without
being
in
love
with
him
of
course
he
must
know
the
whole
truth
but
she
could
tell
him
the
truth
and
then
leave
it
for
him
to
decide
what
right
had
she
to
stand
in
the
way
of
her
friends
or
to
be
a
burden
to
them
when
such
a
mode
of
life
was
offered
to
her
she
had
nothing
of
her
own
and
regarded
herself
as
being
a
dead
weight
on
the
family
and
she
was
conscious
in
a
certain
degree
of
isolation
in
the
household
as
being
her
father
only
child
by
the
first
marriage
she
would
hardly
know
how
to
look
her
father
in
the
face
and
tell
him
that
she
had
again
refused
the
man
but
yet
there
was
something
awful
to
her
in
the
idea
of
giving
herself
to
a
man
without
loving
him
in
becoming
a
man
wife
when
she
would
fain
remain
away
from
him
would
it
be
possible
that
she
should
live
with
him
while
her
feelings
were
of
such
a
nature
and
then
she
blushed
as
she
lay
in
the
dark
with
her
cheek
on
her
pillow
when
she
found
herself
forced
to
inquire
within
her
own
heart
whether
she
did
not
love
some
one
else
she
would
not
own
it
and
yet
she
blushed
and
yet
she
thought
of
it
if
there
might
be
such
a
man
it
was
not
the
young
clergyman
to
whom
her
mother
had
alluded
through
all
that
morning
she
was
very
quiet
very
pale
and
in
truth
very
unhappy
her
father
said
no
further
word
to
her
and
her
stepmother
had
been
implored
to
be
equally
reticent
i
sha
speak
another
word
said
masters
her
fortune
is
in
her
own
hands
and
if
she
do
choose
to
take
it
i
done
with
her
one
man
may
lead
a
horse
to
water
but
a
hundred
ca
make
him
drink
it
just
the
same
with
an
obstinate
young
woman
at
three
twentyman
came
and
was
at
once
desired
to
go
up
to
mary
who
was
waiting
for
him
in
the
masters
smiled
and
was
gracious
as
she
spoke
to
him
having
for
the
moment
wreathed
herself
in
good
humour
so
that
he
might
go
to
his
wooing
in
better
spirit
he
had
learned
his
lesson
by
heart
as
nearly
as
he
was
able
and
began
to
recite
it
as
soon
as
he
had
closed
the
door
so
you
going
to
cheltenham
on
thursday
he
said
yes
mr
twentyman
i
hope
you
enjoy
your
visit
there
i
remember
lady
ushant
myself
very
well
i
do
suppose
she
will
remember
me
but
you
can
give
her
my
compliments
i
certainly
will
do
that
and
now
mary
what
have
you
got
to
say
to
me
he
looked
for
a
moment
as
though
he
expected
she
would
say
what
she
had
to
say
at
once
without
further
question
from
him
but
he
knew
that
it
could
not
be
so
and
he
had
prepared
his
lesson
further
than
that
i
think
you
must
believe
that
i
really
do
love
you
with
all
my
heart
i
know
that
you
are
very
good
to
me
mr
twentyman
i
do
say
anything
about
being
good
but
i
true
that
i
am
take
you
for
my
wife
if
you
had
a
friend
in
the
world
just
for
downright
love
i
got
you
so
in
my
heart
mary
that
i
could
get
rid
of
you
if
i
tried
ever
so
you
must
know
that
true
i
do
know
that
it
true
well
do
you
think
that
a
fellow
like
that
deserves
something
from
a
girl
indeed
i
do
well
he
deserves
a
great
deal
too
much
for
any
girl
to
deceive
him
you
would
like
a
young
woman
to
marry
you
without
loving
you
i
think
you
deserve
a
great
deal
too
well
of
me
for
that
he
paused
a
moment
before
he
replied
i
do
know
about
that
he
said
at
last
i
believe
i
should
be
glad
to
take
you
just
anyhow
i
do
think
you
can
hate
me
certainly
not
i
like
you
as
well
twentyman
as
one
friend
can
like
another
without
loving
i
be
content
with
that
mary
and
chance
it
for
the
rest
i
be
that
kind
to
you
that
i
make
you
love
me
before
twelve
months
are
over
you
come
and
try
you
shall
be
mistress
of
everything
mother
is
one
that
will
want
to
be
in
the
way
it
is
that
larry
she
said
she
had
called
him
larry
for
a
long
time
and
the
sound
of
his
own
name
from
her
lips
gave
him
infinite
hope
come
and
try
say
you
try
if
ever
a
man
did
his
best
to
please
a
woman
i
do
it
to
please
you
then
he
attempted
to
take
her
in
his
arms
but
she
glided
away
from
him
round
the
table
i
wo
ask
you
not
to
go
to
cheltenham
or
anything
of
that
you
shall
have
your
own
time
by
george
you
shall
have
everything
your
own
way
still
she
did
not
answer
him
but
stood
looking
down
upon
the
table
come
say
a
word
to
a
fellow
then
at
last
she
spoke
give
me
six
months
to
think
of
it
six
months
if
you
say
six
weeks
it
is
such
a
serious
thing
to
do
it
is
serious
of
course
i
serious
i
know
i
should
hunt
above
half
as
often
as
i
do
now
and
as
for
the
club
i
suppose
i
should
go
near
the
place
once
a
month
say
six
weeks
and
then
if
you
let
me
have
one
kiss
i
not
trouble
you
till
you
back
from
cheltenham
mary
at
once
perceived
that
he
had
taken
her
doubt
almost
as
a
complete
surrender
and
had
again
to
become
obdurate
at
last
she
promised
to
give
him
a
final
answer
in
two
months
but
declared
as
she
said
so
that
she
was
afraid
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
do
as
he
desired
she
declined
altogether
to
comply
with
that
other
request
which
he
made
and
then
left
him
in
the
room
declaring
that
at
present
she
could
say
nothing
further
as
she
did
so
she
felt
sure
that
she
would
not
be
able
to
accept
him
in
two
months
time
whatever
she
might
bring
herself
to
do
when
the
vast
abyss
of
six
months
should
have
passed
by
larry
made
his
way
down
into
the
parlour
with
hopes
considerably
raised
there
he
found
masters
and
when
he
told
her
what
had
passed
she
assured
him
that
the
thing
was
as
good
as
settled
everybody
knew
she
said
that
when
a
girl
doubted
she
meant
to
yield
and
what
were
two
months
the
time
would
have
nearly
gone
by
the
end
of
her
visit
to
cheltenham
it
was
now
early
in
december
and
they
might
be
married
and
settled
at
home
before
the
end
of
april
masters
to
give
him
courage
took
out
a
bottle
of
currant
wine
and
drank
his
health
and
told
him
that
in
three
months
time
she
would
give
him
a
kiss
and
call
him
her
son
and
she
believed
what
she
said
this
she
thought
was
merely
mary
way
of
letting
herself
down
without
a
sudden
fall
then
the
attorney
came
in
and
also
congratulated
him
when
the
attorney
was
told
that
mary
had
taken
two
months
for
her
decision
he
also
felt
that
the
matter
was
almost
as
good
as
settled
this
at
any
rate
was
clear
to
him
that
the
existing
misery
of
his
household
would
for
the
present
cease
and
that
mary
would
be
allowed
to
go
upon
her
visit
without
further
opposition
he
at
present
did
not
think
it
wise
to
say
another
word
to
mary
about
the
young
man
nor
would
masters
condescend
to
do
so
mary
would
of
course
now
accept
her
lover
like
any
other
girl
and
had
been
such
a
fool
so
thought
masters
that
she
had
thoroughly
deserved
to
lose
him
chapter
xxvii
wonderful
bird
there
were
but
two
days
between
the
scenes
described
in
the
last
chapter
and
the
day
fixed
for
mary
departure
and
during
these
two
days
larry
twentyman
name
was
not
mentioned
in
the
house
masters
did
not
make
herself
quite
pleasant
to
her
stepdaughter
having
still
some
grudge
against
her
as
to
the
nor
though
she
had
submitted
to
the
visit
to
cheltenham
did
she
approve
of
it
it
was
the
way
she
said
to
make
such
a
girl
as
mary
like
her
life
at
chowton
farm
going
and
sitting
and
doing
nothing
in
old
lady
ushant
it
was
cocking
her
up
with
gimcrack
notions
about
ladies
till
she
be
ashamed
to
look
at
her
own
hands
after
she
had
done
a
day
work
with
them
there
was
no
doubt
some
truth
in
this
the
woman
understood
the
world
and
was
able
to
measure
larry
twentyman
and
lady
ushant
and
the
rest
of
them
books
and
pretty
needlework
and
easy
conversation
would
consume
the
time
at
cheltenham
whereas
at
chowton
farm
there
would
be
a
dairy
and
a
poultry
yard
under
difficulties
on
account
of
the
foxes
with
a
prospect
of
baby
linen
and
children
shoes
and
stockings
it
was
all
that
question
of
gentlemen
and
ladies
and
of
and
they
ought
masters
thought
to
be
kept
distinct
she
had
never
she
said
wanted
to
put
her
finger
into
a
pie
that
did
belong
to
her
she
had
never
tried
to
be
a
grand
lady
but
mary
was
perilously
near
the
brink
on
either
side
and
as
it
was
to
be
her
lucky
fate
at
last
to
sit
down
to
a
plentiful
but
life
at
chowton
farm
she
ought
to
have
been
kept
away
from
the
maundering
idleness
of
lady
ushant
lodgings
at
cheltenham
but
mary
heard
nothing
of
this
during
these
two
days
masters
bestowing
the
load
of
her
wisdom
upon
her
unfortunate
husband
reginald
morton
had
been
twice
over
at
masters
house
with
reference
to
the
proposed
journey
masters
was
hardly
civil
to
him
as
he
was
supposed
to
be
among
the
enemies
but
she
had
no
suspicion
that
he
himself
was
the
enemy
of
enemies
had
she
entertained
such
an
idea
she
might
have
reconciled
herself
to
it
as
the
man
was
able
to
support
a
wife
and
by
such
a
marriage
she
would
have
been
at
once
relieved
from
all
further
charge
in
her
own
mind
she
would
have
felt
very
strongly
that
mary
had
chosen
the
wrong
man
and
thrown
herself
into
the
inferior
mode
of
life
but
her
own
difficulties
in
the
matter
would
have
been
solved
there
was
however
no
dream
of
such
a
kind
entertained
by
any
of
the
family
reginald
morton
was
hardly
regarded
as
a
young
man
and
was
supposed
to
be
gloomy
misanthropic
and
bookish
masters
was
not
at
all
averse
to
the
companionship
for
the
journey
and
masters
was
really
grateful
to
one
of
the
old
family
for
being
kind
to
his
girl
nor
must
it
be
supposed
that
mary
herself
had
any
expectations
or
even
any
hopes
with
juvenile
aptness
to
make
much
of
the
little
things
which
had
interested
her
and
prone
to
think
more
than
was
reasonable
of
any
intercourse
with
a
man
who
seemed
to
her
to
be
so
superior
to
others
as
reginald
morton
she
was
anxious
for
an
opportunity
to
set
herself
right
with
him
about
that
scene
at
the
bridge
she
still
thought
that
he
was
offended
and
that
she
had
given
him
cause
for
offence
he
had
condescended
to
make
her
a
request
to
which
she
had
acceded
and
she
had
then
not
done
as
she
had
promised
she
thought
she
was
sure
that
this
was
all
she
had
to
say
to
him
and
yet
she
was
aware
that
she
was
unnaturally
excited
at
the
idea
of
spending
three
or
four
hours
alone
with
him
the
fly
which
was
to
take
him
to
the
railway
station
called
for
mary
at
the
attorney
door
at
ten
and
the
attorney
handed
her
in
it
is
very
good
of
you
indeed
morton
to
take
so
much
trouble
with
my
girl
said
the
attorney
really
feeling
what
he
said
it
is
very
good
of
you
to
trust
her
to
me
said
reginald
also
sincerely
mary
was
still
to
him
the
girl
who
had
been
brought
up
by
his
aunt
at
bragton
and
not
the
fit
companion
for
larry
twentyman
reginald
morton
had
certainly
not
made
up
his
mind
to
ask
mary
masters
to
be
his
wife
thinking
of
mary
masters
very
often
as
he
had
done
during
the
last
two
months
he
was
quite
sure
that
he
did
not
mean
to
marry
at
all
he
did
acknowledge
to
himself
that
were
he
to
allow
himself
to
fall
in
love
with
any
one
it
would
be
with
mary
masters
but
for
not
doing
so
there
were
many
reasons
he
had
lived
so
long
alone
that
a
married
life
would
not
suit
him
as
a
married
man
he
would
be
a
poor
man
he
himself
was
averse
to
company
whereas
most
women
prefer
society
and
then
as
to
this
special
girl
had
he
not
reason
for
supposing
that
she
preferred
another
man
to
him
and
a
man
of
such
a
class
that
the
very
preference
showed
her
to
be
unfit
to
mate
with
him
he
also
cozened
himself
with
an
idea
that
it
was
well
that
he
should
have
the
opportunity
which
the
journey
would
give
him
of
apologising
for
his
previous
rudeness
to
her
in
the
carriage
they
had
the
compartment
to
themselves
with
the
exception
of
an
old
lady
at
the
further
end
who
had
a
parrot
in
a
cage
for
which
she
had
taken
a
ticket
i
ca
offer
you
this
seat
said
the
old
lady
because
it
has
been
booked
and
paid
for
for
my
bird
as
neither
of
the
new
passengers
had
shown
the
slightest
wish
for
the
seat
the
communication
was
perhaps
unnecessary
neither
of
the
two
had
any
idea
of
separating
from
the
other
for
the
sake
of
the
old
lady
company
they
had
before
them
a
journey
of
thirty
miles
on
one
railway
then
a
stop
of
half
an
hour
at
the
hinxton
junction
and
then
another
journey
of
about
equal
length
in
the
first
hour
very
little
was
said
that
might
not
have
been
said
in
the
presence
of
lady
ushant
or
even
of
masters
there
might
be
a
question
whether
upon
the
whole
the
parrot
had
not
the
best
of
the
conversation
as
the
bird
which
the
old
lady
declared
to
be
the
wonder
of
his
species
repeated
the
last
word
of
nearly
every
sentence
spoken
either
by
our
friends
or
by
the
old
lady
herself
do
you
think
you
be
less
liable
to
cold
with
that
window
closed
the
old
lady
said
to
mary
cosed
cosed
cosed
said
the
bird
and
morton
was
of
course
constrained
to
shut
the
window
he
is
a
wonderful
bird
said
the
old
lady
wonderful
bird
wonderful
bird
wonderful
bird
said
the
parrot
who
was
quite
at
home
with
this
expression
we
shall
be
able
to
get
some
lunch
at
hinxton
said
reginald
inxton
screamed
the
bird
caw
caw
caw
he
worth
a
deal
of
money
said
the
old
lady
deal
o
money
deal
o
money
repeated
the
bird
as
he
scrambled
round
the
wire
cage
with
a
tremendous
noise
to
the
great
triumph
of
the
old
lady
no
doubt
the
close
attention
which
the
bird
paid
to
everything
that
passed
and
the
presence
of
the
old
lady
as
well
did
for
a
time
interfere
with
their
conversation
but
after
awhile
the
old
lady
was
asleep
and
the
bird
having
once
or
twice
attempted
to
imitate
the
somnolent
sounds
which
his
mistress
was
making
seemed
also
to
go
to
sleep
himself
then
reginald
beginning
with
lady
ushant
and
the
old
morton
family
generally
gradually
got
the
conversation
round
to
bragton
and
the
little
bridge
he
had
been
very
stern
when
he
had
left
her
there
and
he
knew
also
that
at
that
subsequent
interview
when
he
had
brought
lady
ushant
note
to
her
at
her
father
house
he
had
not
been
cordially
kind
to
her
now
they
were
thrown
together
for
an
hour
or
so
in
the
closest
companionship
and
he
wished
to
make
her
comfortable
and
happy
i
suppose
you
remember
bragton
he
said
every
path
and
almost
every
tree
about
the
place
so
do
i
called
there
the
other
day
family
quarrels
are
so
silly
you
know
did
you
see
mr
morton
no
and
he
has
returned
my
visit
yet
i
do
know
whether
he
will
and
i
do
much
mind
whether
he
does
or
not
that
old
woman
is
there
and
she
is
very
bitter
against
me
i
do
care
about
the
people
but
i
am
sorry
that
i
can
not
see
the
place
i
ought
to
have
walked
with
you
that
day
she
said
in
a
very
low
tone
the
parrot
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
at
them
as
though
he
were
striving
to
catch
his
cue
of
course
you
ought
but
as
he
said
this
he
smiled
and
there
was
no
offence
in
his
voice
i
dare
say
you
did
guess
how
much
i
thought
of
it
and
then
i
was
a
bear
to
you
i
always
am
a
bear
when
i
am
not
pleased
peas
peas
peas
said
the
parrot
i
shall
be
a
bear
to
that
brute
of
a
bird
before
long
what
a
very
queer
bird
he
is
he
is
a
public
nuisance
and
so
is
the
old
lady
who
brought
him
here
this
was
said
quite
in
a
whisper
it
is
very
odd
miss
masters
but
you
are
literally
the
only
person
in
all
dillsborough
in
regard
to
whom
i
have
any
genuine
feeling
of
old
friendship
you
must
remember
a
great
many
but
i
did
not
know
any
well
enough
i
was
too
young
to
have
seen
much
of
your
father
but
when
i
came
back
at
that
time
you
and
i
were
always
together
gedder
gedder
gedder
said
the
parrot
if
that
bird
goes
on
like
that
i
speak
to
the
guard
said
morton
with
affected
anger
polly
must
talk
said
the
old
lady
waking
up
tok
tok
tok
tok
screamed
the
parrot
then
the
old
lady
threw
a
shawl
over
him
and
again
went
to
sleep
if
i
behaved
badly
i
beg
your
pardon
said
mary
that
just
what
i
wanted
to
say
to
you
miss
masters
only
a
man
never
can
do
those
things
as
well
as
a
lady
i
did
behave
badly
and
i
do
beg
your
pardon
of
course
i
ought
to
have
asked
twentyman
to
come
with
us
i
know
that
he
is
a
very
good
fellow
indeed
he
is
said
mary
masters
with
all
the
emphasis
in
her
power
deedy
is
deedy
is
deedy
is
deedy
is
repeated
the
parrot
in
a
very
angry
voice
about
a
dozen
times
under
his
shawl
and
while
the
old
lady
was
remonstrating
with
her
too
talkative
companion
their
tickets
were
taken
and
they
ran
into
the
hinxton
station
if
the
old
lady
is
going
on
to
cheltenham
we
travel
third
class
before
sit
in
the
same
carriage
again
with
that
bird
said
morton
laughing
as
he
took
mary
into
the
but
the
old
lady
did
not
get
into
the
same
compartment
as
they
started
and
the
last
that
was
heard
of
the
parrot
at
hinxton
was
a
quarrel
between
him
and
the
guard
as
to
certain
railway
privileges
when
they
had
got
back
into
the
railway
carriage
morton
was
very
anxious
to
ask
whether
she
was
in
truth
engaged
to
marry
the
young
man
as
to
whose
good
fellowship
she
and
the
parrot
had
spoken
up
so
emphatically
but
he
hardly
knew
how
to
put
the
question
and
were
she
to
declare
that
she
was
engaged
to
him
what
should
he
say
then
would
he
not
be
bound
to
congratulate
her
and
yet
it
would
be
impossible
that
any
word
of
such
congratulation
should
pass
his
lips
you
will
stay
a
month
at
cheltenham
he
said
your
aunt
was
kind
enough
to
ask
me
for
so
long
i
shall
go
back
on
saturday
if
i
were
to
stay
longer
i
should
feel
myself
to
be
in
her
way
and
i
have
come
to
live
a
sort
of
life
i
hardly
know
how
to
sit
down
and
eat
my
dinner
in
company
and
have
no
idea
of
seeing
a
human
being
before
two
what
do
you
do
with
yourself
i
rush
in
and
out
of
the
garden
and
spend
my
time
between
my
books
and
my
flowers
and
my
tobacco
pipes
do
you
mean
to
live
always
like
that
she
asked
in
perfect
innocency
i
think
so
sometimes
i
doubt
whether
it
wise
i
do
think
it
wise
at
all
said
mary
why
not
people
should
live
together
i
think
you
mean
that
i
ought
to
have
a
wife
no
i
did
mean
that
of
course
that
must
be
just
as
you
might
come
to
like
any
one
well
enough
but
a
person
need
not
shut
himself
up
and
be
a
hermit
because
he
is
not
married
lord
rufford
is
not
married
and
he
goes
everywhere
he
has
money
and
property
and
is
a
man
of
pleasure
and
your
cousin
john
morton
he
is
essentially
a
man
of
business
which
i
never
could
have
been
and
they
say
he
is
going
to
be
married
to
that
miss
trefoil
who
has
been
staying
there
unfortunately
i
have
never
had
anything
that
i
need
do
in
all
my
life
and
therefore
i
have
shut
myself
up
as
you
call
it
i
wonder
what
your
life
will
be
mary
blushed
and
said
nothing
if
there
were
anything
to
tell
i
wish
i
knew
it
there
is
nothing
to
tell
nothing
she
thought
a
moment
before
she
answered
him
and
then
she
said
nothing
what
should
i
have
to
tell
she
added
trying
to
laugh
he
remained
for
a
few
minutes
silent
and
then
put
his
head
out
towards
her
as
he
spoke
i
was
afraid
that
you
might
have
to
tell
that
you
were
engaged
to
marry
mr
twentyman
i
am
not
oh
i
am
so
glad
to
hear
it
i
do
know
why
you
should
be
glad
if
i
had
said
i
was
it
would
have
been
very
uncivil
if
you
had
declared
yourself
glad
to
hear
that
then
i
must
have
been
uncivil
for
i
could
have
done
it
knowing
how
my
aunt
loves
you
knowing
what
she
thinks
of
you
and
what
she
would
think
of
such
a
match
remembering
myself
what
i
do
of
you
i
could
not
have
congratulated
you
on
your
engagement
to
a
man
whom
i
think
so
much
inferior
to
yourself
in
every
respect
now
you
know
it
all
why
i
was
angry
at
the
bridge
why
i
was
hardly
civil
to
you
at
your
father
house
and
to
tell
the
truth
why
i
have
been
so
anxious
to
be
alone
with
you
for
half
an
hour
if
you
think
it
an
offence
that
i
should
take
so
much
interest
in
you
i
will
beg
your
pardon
for
that
also
oh
no
i
have
never
spoken
to
my
aunt
about
it
but
i
do
not
think
that
she
would
have
been
contented
to
hear
that
you
were
to
become
the
wife
of
mr
twentyman
what
answer
she
was
to
make
to
this
or
whether
she
was
to
make
any
she
had
not
decided
when
they
were
interrupted
by
the
reappearance
of
the
old
lady
and
the
bird
she
was
declaring
to
the
guard
at
the
window
that
as
she
had
paid
for
a
seat
for
her
parrot
she
would
get
into
any
carriage
she
liked
in
which
there
were
two
empty
seats
her
bird
had
been
by
some
scurrilous
travellers
and
she
had
therefore
returned
to
the
comparative
kindness
of
her
former
companions
they
threatened
to
put
him
out
of
the
window
sir
said
the
old
woman
to
morton
as
she
was
forcing
her
way
in
windersir
windersir
said
the
parrot
i
hope
he
behave
himself
here
said
morton
heremam
heremam
heremam
said
the
parrot
now
go
to
bed
like
a
good
bird
said
the
old
lady
putting
her
shawl
over
the
cage
whereupon
the
parrot
made
a
more
diabolical
noise
than
ever
under
the
curtain
mary
felt
that
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
about
twentyman
and
her
hopes
and
prospects
and
for
the
moment
she
was
glad
to
be
left
in
peace
the
old
lady
and
the
parrot
continued
their
conversation
till
they
had
all
arrived
in
cheltenham
and
mary
as
she
sat
alone
thinking
of
it
afterwards
might
perhaps
feel
a
soft
regret
that
reginald
morton
had
been
interrupted
by
the
talkative
animal
volume
ii
chapter
mounser
green
so
peter
boyd
is
to
go
to
washington
in
the
paragon
place
and
jack
slade
goes
to
vienna
and
young
palliser
is
to
get
berth
at
lisbon
this
information
was
given
by
a
handsome
man
known
as
mounser
green
about
six
feet
high
wearing
a
velvet
shooting
coat
more
properly
called
an
office
coat
from
its
present
uses
who
had
just
entered
a
spacious
comfortable
room
in
which
three
other
gentlemen
were
sitting
at
their
different
tables
this
was
one
of
the
rooms
in
the
foreign
office
and
looked
out
into
james
park
mounser
green
was
a
distinguished
clerk
in
that
department
and
distinguished
also
in
various
ways
being
one
of
the
fashionable
men
about
town
a
great
adept
at
private
theatricals
remarkable
as
a
billiard
player
at
his
club
and
a
contributor
to
various
magazines
at
this
moment
he
had
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
and
when
he
entered
the
room
he
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fire
ready
for
conversation
and
looking
very
unlike
a
clerk
who
intended
to
do
any
work
but
there
was
a
general
idea
that
mounser
green
was
invaluable
to
the
foreign
office
he
could
speak
and
write
two
or
three
foreign
languages
he
could
do
a
spurt
of
work
ten
hours
at
a
sitting
when
required
he
was
ready
to
go
through
fire
and
water
for
his
chief
and
was
a
gentleman
all
round
though
still
nominally
a
young
man
being
perhaps
years
of
age
he
had
entered
the
service
before
competitive
examination
had
assumed
its
present
shape
and
had
therefore
the
gifts
which
were
required
for
his
special
position
some
critics
on
the
civil
service
were
no
doubt
apt
to
find
fault
with
mounser
green
when
called
upon
at
his
office
he
was
never
seen
to
be
doing
anything
and
he
always
had
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
these
gentlemen
found
out
too
that
he
never
entered
his
office
till
twelve
perhaps
not
having
also
learned
that
he
was
generally
there
till
nearly
seven
no
doubt
during
the
time
that
he
remained
there
he
read
a
great
many
newspapers
and
wrote
a
great
many
private
notes
on
official
paper
but
there
may
be
a
question
whether
even
these
employments
did
not
help
to
make
mounser
green
the
valuable
man
he
was
what
a
lounge
for
jack
slade
said
young
hoffmann
i
tell
you
who
it
wo
be
a
lounge
for
green
said
archibald
currie
the
clerk
who
held
the
second
authority
among
them
what
will
bell
trefoil
think
of
going
to
patagonia
that
all
off
said
mounser
green
i
do
think
so
said
charley
glossop
one
of
the
numerous
younger
sons
of
lord
glossop
she
was
staying
only
the
other
day
down
at
the
paragon
place
in
rufford
and
they
went
together
to
my
cousin
rufford
house
his
sister
that
lady
penwether
told
me
they
were
certainly
engaged
then
that
was
before
the
paragon
had
been
named
for
patagonia
to
tell
you
a
little
bit
of
my
own
private
mind
which
is
scandal
said
mounser
green
because
it
is
only
given
as
opinion
i
think
it
just
possible
that
the
paragon
has
taken
this
very
uncomfortable
mission
because
it
offered
him
some
chance
of
escape
then
he
has
more
sense
about
him
than
i
gave
him
credit
for
said
archibald
currie
why
should
a
man
like
morton
go
to
patagonia
continued
green
he
has
an
independent
fortune
and
does
want
the
money
he
have
been
sure
to
have
something
comfortable
in
europe
very
soon
if
he
had
waited
and
was
much
better
off
as
second
at
a
place
like
washington
i
was
quite
surprised
when
he
took
it
patagonia
is
bad
at
all
said
currie
that
depends
on
whether
a
man
has
got
money
of
his
own
when
i
heard
about
the
paragon
and
bell
trefoil
at
washington
i
knew
there
had
been
a
mistake
made
he
did
know
what
he
was
doing
i
a
poor
man
but
i
would
take
her
with
a
year
settled
on
myself
poor
mounser
green
i
think
she
the
handsomest
girl
in
london
said
hoffmann
who
was
a
young
man
of
german
parentage
and
perhaps
of
german
taste
that
may
be
continued
green
but
heaven
and
earth
what
a
life
she
would
lead
a
man
like
the
paragon
he
found
it
out
and
therefore
thought
it
well
to
go
to
south
america
she
has
declined
already
i
told
but
he
means
to
stick
to
the
mission
during
all
this
time
mounser
green
was
smoking
his
cigar
with
his
back
to
the
fire
and
the
other
clerks
looked
as
though
they
had
nothing
to
do
but
talk
about
the
private
affairs
of
ministers
abroad
and
their
friends
of
course
it
will
be
understood
that
since
we
last
saw
john
morton
the
position
of
minister
plenipotentiary
at
patagonia
had
been
offered
to
him
and
that
he
had
accepted
the
place
in
spite
of
bragton
and
of
arabella
trefoil
at
that
moment
a
card
was
handed
to
mounser
green
by
a
messenger
who
was
desired
to
show
the
gentleman
up
it
the
paragon
himself
said
green
we
make
him
tell
us
whether
he
going
out
single
or
double
said
archibald
currie
after
what
the
rufford
people
said
to
me
i
sure
he
going
to
marry
her
said
young
glossop
no
doubt
lady
penwether
had
been
anxious
to
make
it
understood
by
every
one
connected
with
the
family
that
if
any
gossip
should
be
heard
about
rufford
and
arabella
trefoil
there
was
nothing
in
it
then
the
paragon
was
shown
into
the
room
and
mounser
green
and
the
young
men
were
delighted
to
see
him
colonial
governors
at
their
seats
of
government
and
ministers
plenipotentiary
in
their
ambassadorial
residences
are
very
great
persons
indeed
and
when
met
in
society
at
home
with
the
stars
and
ribbons
which
are
common
among
them
now
they
are
less
indeed
but
still
something
but
at
the
colonial
and
foreign
offices
in
london
among
the
assistant
secretaries
and
clerks
they
are
hardly
more
than
common
men
all
the
gingerbread
is
gone
there
his
excellency
is
no
more
than
jones
and
the
representative
or
alter
ego
of
royalty
mildly
asks
little
favours
of
the
junior
clerks
lord
drummond
only
wants
to
know
what
you
wish
and
it
shall
be
done
said
mounser
green
lord
drummond
was
the
minister
for
foreign
affairs
of
the
day
i
hope
i
need
hardly
say
that
we
were
delighted
that
you
accepted
the
offer
one
does
like
to
refuse
a
step
upward
said
morton
otherwise
patagonia
is
exactly
the
place
one
would
like
very
good
climate
said
currie
ladies
i
have
known
who
have
gone
there
have
enjoyed
it
very
much
a
little
rough
i
suppose
they
did
seem
to
say
so
young
bartletot
took
his
wife
out
there
just
married
he
liked
it
there
was
much
society
but
they
did
care
about
that
just
at
first
ah
i
a
single
man
said
morton
laughing
he
was
too
good
a
diplomate
to
be
pumped
in
that
simple
way
by
such
a
one
as
archibald
currie
you
like
to
see
lord
drummond
he
is
here
and
will
be
glad
to
shake
hands
with
you
come
into
my
room
then
mounser
green
led
the
way
into
a
small
inner
sanctum
in
which
it
may
be
presumed
that
he
really
did
his
work
it
was
here
at
any
rate
that
he
wrote
the
notes
on
official
note
paper
they
have
settled
as
yet
how
they
to
be
off
it
said
currie
in
a
whisper
as
soon
as
the
two
men
were
gone
but
i
bet
a
note
that
bell
trefoil
does
go
out
to
patagonia
as
his
wife
we
know
the
senator
here
well
enough
this
was
said
in
the
inner
room
by
mounser
green
to
morton
who
had
breakfasted
with
the
senator
that
morning
and
had
made
an
appointment
to
meet
him
at
the
foreign
office
the
senator
wanted
to
secure
a
seat
for
himself
at
the
opening
of
parliament
which
was
appointed
to
take
place
in
the
course
of
the
next
month
and
being
a
member
of
the
committee
on
foreign
affairs
in
the
american
senate
of
course
thought
himself
entitled
to
have
things
done
for
him
by
the
foreign
office
clerks
oh
yes
see
him
lord
drummond
will
get
him
a
seat
as
a
matter
of
course
how
is
he
getting
on
with
your
neighbour
at
dillsborough
so
you
heard
of
that
heard
of
it
who
has
heard
of
it
at
this
moment
the
messenger
came
in
again
and
the
senator
was
announced
lord
drummond
will
manage
about
the
seats
in
the
house
of
lords
gotobed
of
course
he
see
you
if
you
wish
it
but
i
take
a
note
of
it
if
you
do
that
green
i
shall
be
fixed
up
straight
and
a
great
deal
sooner
see
you
than
his
lordship
that
very
flattering
gotobed
but
i
sure
i
do
know
why
because
lord
drummond
always
seems
to
me
to
have
more
on
hand
than
he
knows
how
to
get
through
and
you
never
seem
to
have
anything
to
do
that
not
quite
so
flattering
and
would
be
killing
only
that
i
feel
that
your
opinion
is
founded
on
error
mens
conscia
recti
mr
gotobed
exactly
i
understand
english
pretty
well
better
as
far
as
i
can
see
than
some
of
those
i
meet
around
me
here
but
i
do
go
beyond
that
mr
green
i
merely
meant
to
observe
gotobed
that
as
within
my
own
breast
i
am
conscious
of
my
zeal
and
diligence
in
her
service
your
shafts
of
satire
pass
me
by
without
hurting
me
shall
i
offer
you
a
cigar
a
candle
burned
at
both
ends
is
soon
consumed
it
was
quite
clear
that
as
quickly
as
the
senator
got
through
one
end
of
his
cigar
by
the
usual
process
of
burning
so
quickly
did
he
eat
the
other
end
but
he
took
that
which
mounser
green
offered
him
without
any
displeasure
at
the
allusion
i
sorry
to
say
that
i
have
a
spittoon
said
mounser
green
but
the
whole
is
at
your
service
the
senator
could
hardly
have
heard
this
as
it
made
no
difference
in
his
practice
morton
at
this
moment
was
sent
for
by
the
secretary
of
state
and
the
senator
expressed
his
intention
of
waiting
for
him
in
room
how
does
the
great
goarly
case
get
on
mr
gotobed
asked
the
clerk
well
i
do
know
that
it
getting
on
very
much
you
are
not
growing
tired
of
it
senator
not
by
any
means
but
it
getting
itself
complicated
green
i
mean
to
see
the
end
of
it
and
if
i
beat
why
i
can
take
a
beating
as
well
as
another
man
you
begin
to
think
you
will
be
beat
i
did
say
so
green
it
is
very
hard
to
understand
all
the
ins
and
outs
of
a
case
like
that
in
a
foreign
country
then
i
should
try
it
senator
there
i
differ
it
is
my
object
to
learn
all
i
can
at
any
rate
i
should
pay
for
the
lesson
as
you
are
like
to
do
what
the
bill
be
four
hundred
dollars
never
mind
green
if
you
take
the
opinion
of
a
good
deal
older
man
than
yourself
and
one
who
has
perhaps
worked
harder
understand
that
there
no
knowledge
got
so
thoroughly
as
that
for
which
a
man
pays
soon
after
this
morton
came
out
from
the
great
man
room
and
went
away
in
company
with
the
senator
chapter
ii
the
senator
letter
soon
after
this
senator
gotobed
went
down
alone
to
dillsborough
and
put
himself
up
at
the
bush
inn
although
he
had
by
no
means
the
reputation
of
being
a
rich
man
he
did
not
seem
to
care
much
what
money
he
spent
in
furthering
any
object
he
had
taken
in
hand
he
never
knew
how
near
he
had
been
to
meeting
the
direst
inhospitality
at
runciman
house
that
worthy
innkeeper
knowing
well
the
senator
sympathy
with
goarly
scrobby
and
bearside
and
being
heart
and
soul
devoted
to
the
rufford
interest
had
almost
refused
the
senator
the
accommodation
he
wanted
it
was
only
when
runciman
represented
to
him
that
she
could
charge
ten
shillings
a
day
for
the
use
of
her
and
also
that
lord
rufford
himself
had
condescended
to
entertain
the
gentleman
that
runciman
gave
way
gotobed
would
no
doubt
have
delighted
in
such
inhospitality
he
would
have
gone
to
the
inn
which
was
very
indeed
and
have
acquired
a
further
insight
into
british
manners
and
british
prejudices
as
it
was
he
made
himself
at
home
in
the
best
upstairs
at
the
bush
and
was
quite
unaware
of
the
indignity
offered
to
him
when
runciman
refused
to
send
him
up
the
best
sherry
let
us
hope
that
this
refusal
was
remembered
by
the
young
woman
in
the
bar
when
she
made
out
the
senator
bill
he
stayed
at
dillsborough
for
three
or
four
days
during
which
he
saw
goarly
once
and
bearside
on
two
or
three
occasions
and
moreover
handed
to
that
busy
attorney
three
bank
notes
for
each
bearside
was
clever
enough
to
make
him
believe
that
goarly
would
certainly
obtain
serious
damages
from
the
lord
with
bearside
he
was
fairly
satisfied
thinking
however
that
the
man
was
much
more
illiterate
and
ignorant
than
the
general
run
of
lawyers
in
the
united
states
but
with
goarly
he
was
by
no
means
satisfied
goarly
endeavoured
to
keep
out
of
his
way
and
could
not
be
induced
to
come
to
him
at
the
bush
three
times
he
walked
out
to
the
house
near
dillsborough
wood
on
each
of
which
occasions
goarly
pestered
him
for
money
and
told
him
at
great
length
the
history
of
her
forlorn
goose
scrobby
of
whom
he
had
heard
he
could
not
see
at
all
and
he
found
that
bearside
was
very
unwilling
to
say
anything
about
scrobby
scrobby
and
the
red
herrings
and
the
strychnine
and
the
dead
fox
were
according
to
bearside
to
be
kept
quite
distinct
from
the
pheasants
and
the
wheat
bearside
declared
over
and
over
again
that
there
was
no
evidence
to
connect
his
client
with
the
demise
of
the
fox
when
asked
whether
he
did
not
think
that
his
client
had
compassed
the
death
of
the
animal
he
assured
the
senator
that
in
such
matters
he
never
ventured
to
think
let
us
go
by
the
evidence
gotobed
he
said
but
i
am
paying
my
money
for
the
sake
of
getting
at
the
facts
evidence
is
facts
sir
said
the
attorney
any
way
let
us
settle
about
the
pheasants
first
the
condition
of
the
senator
mind
may
perhaps
be
best
made
known
by
a
letter
which
he
wrote
from
dillsborough
to
his
especial
and
friend
josiah
scroome
a
member
of
the
house
of
representatives
from
his
own
state
of
mickewa
since
he
had
been
in
england
he
had
written
constantly
to
his
friend
giving
him
the
result
of
his
british
experiences
bush
inn
dillsborough
ufford
county
england
december
my
dear
sir
since
my
last
i
have
enjoyed
myself
very
well
and
i
am
i
trust
beginning
to
understand
something
of
the
mode
of
thinking
of
this
very
peculiar
people
that
there
should
be
so
wide
a
difference
between
us
americans
and
these
english
from
whom
we
were
divided
so
to
say
but
the
other
day
is
one
of
the
most
peculiar
physiological
phenomena
that
the
history
of
the
world
will
have
afforded
as
far
as
i
can
hear
a
german
or
even
a
frenchman
thinks
much
more
as
an
englishman
thinks
than
does
an
american
nor
does
this
come
mainly
from
the
greater
prevalence
with
us
of
democratic
institutions
i
do
not
think
that
any
one
can
perceive
in
half
an
conversation
the
difference
between
a
swiss
and
a
german
but
i
fancy
and
i
may
say
i
flatter
myself
that
an
american
is
as
easily
distinguished
from
an
englishman
as
a
sheep
from
a
goat
or
a
tall
man
from
one
who
is
short
and
yet
there
is
a
pleasure
in
associating
with
those
here
of
the
highest
rank
which
i
find
it
hard
to
describe
and
which
perhaps
i
ought
to
regard
as
a
pernicious
temptation
to
useless
luxury
there
is
an
ease
of
manner
with
them
which
recalls
with
unfavourable
reminiscences
the
hard
of
the
better
class
of
our
citizens
there
is
a
story
of
an
old
hero
who
with
his
companions
fell
among
beautiful
women
and
luscious
wine
and
but
that
the
hero
had
been
warned
in
time
they
would
all
have
been
turned
into
filthy
animals
by
yielding
to
the
allurements
around
them
the
temptation
here
is
perhaps
the
same
i
am
not
a
hero
and
though
i
too
have
been
warned
by
the
lessons
i
have
learned
under
our
happy
constitution
i
feel
that
i
might
easily
become
one
of
the
animals
in
question
and
to
give
them
their
due
it
is
better
than
merely
beautiful
women
and
luscious
wine
there
is
a
reality
about
them
and
a
desire
to
live
up
to
their
principles
which
is
very
grand
their
principles
are
no
doubt
bad
utterly
antagonistic
to
all
progress
unconscious
altogether
of
the
demand
for
progressive
equality
which
is
made
by
the
united
voices
of
suffering
mankind
the
man
who
is
born
a
lord
and
who
sees
a
dozen
serfs
around
him
who
have
been
born
to
be
ploughmen
thinks
that
god
arranged
it
all
and
that
he
is
bound
to
maintain
a
state
of
things
so
comfortable
to
himself
as
being
god
vicegerent
here
on
earth
but
they
do
their
work
as
vicegerents
with
an
easy
grace
and
with
sweet
pleasant
voices
and
soft
movements
which
almost
make
a
man
doubt
whether
the
almighty
has
not
in
truth
intended
that
such
injustice
should
be
permanent
that
one
man
should
be
rich
and
another
poor
is
a
necessity
in
the
present
imperfect
state
of
civilisation
but
that
one
man
should
be
born
to
be
a
legislator
born
to
have
everything
born
to
be
a
tyrant
and
should
think
it
all
right
is
to
me
miraculous
but
the
greatest
miracle
of
all
is
that
they
who
are
not
so
born
who
have
been
born
to
suffer
the
reverse
side
should
also
think
it
to
be
all
right
with
us
it
is
necessary
that
a
man
to
shine
in
society
should
have
done
something
or
should
at
any
rate
have
the
capacity
of
doing
something
but
here
the
greatest
fool
that
you
meet
will
shine
and
will
be
admitted
to
be
brilliant
simply
because
he
has
possessions
such
a
one
will
take
his
part
in
conversation
though
he
knows
nothing
and
when
inquired
into
he
will
own
that
he
knows
nothing
to
know
anything
is
not
his
line
in
life
but
he
can
move
about
and
chatter
like
a
child
of
ten
and
amuse
himself
from
morning
to
night
with
various
empty
playthings
and
be
absolutely
proud
of
his
life
i
have
lately
become
acquainted
with
a
certain
young
lord
here
of
this
class
who
has
treated
me
with
great
kindness
although
i
have
taken
it
into
my
head
to
oppose
him
as
to
a
matter
in
which
he
is
much
interested
i
ventured
to
inquire
of
him
as
to
the
pursuits
of
his
life
he
is
a
lord
and
therefore
a
legislator
but
he
made
no
scruple
to
tell
me
that
he
never
goes
near
the
chamber
in
which
it
is
his
privilege
to
have
a
seat
but
his
party
does
not
lose
his
support
though
he
never
goes
near
the
place
he
can
vote
and
is
enabled
to
trust
his
vote
to
some
other
more
ambitious
lord
who
does
go
there
it
required
the
absolute
evidence
of
personal
information
from
those
who
are
themselves
concerned
to
make
me
believe
that
legislation
in
great
britain
could
be
carried
on
after
such
a
fashion
as
this
then
he
told
me
what
he
does
do
all
the
winter
he
hunts
and
shoots
going
about
to
other
rich
men
houses
when
there
is
no
longer
sufficient
for
him
to
shoot
left
on
his
own
estate
that
lasts
him
from
the
of
september
to
the
end
of
march
and
occupies
all
his
time
august
he
spends
in
scotland
also
shooting
other
animals
during
the
other
months
he
fishes
and
plays
cricket
and
tennis
and
attends
races
and
goes
about
to
parties
in
london
his
evenings
he
spends
at
a
card
table
when
he
can
get
friends
to
play
with
him
it
is
the
employment
of
his
life
to
fit
in
his
amusements
so
that
he
may
not
have
a
dull
day
wherever
he
goes
he
carries
his
wine
with
him
and
his
valet
and
his
grooms
and
if
he
thinks
there
is
anything
to
fear
his
cook
also
he
very
rarely
opens
a
book
he
is
more
ignorant
than
a
boy
of
fifteen
with
us
and
yet
he
manages
to
have
something
to
say
about
everything
when
his
ignorance
has
been
made
as
clear
as
the
sun
at
he
is
no
whit
ashamed
one
would
say
that
such
a
life
would
break
the
heart
of
any
man
but
upon
my
word
i
doubt
whether
i
ever
came
across
a
human
being
so
as
this
young
lord
i
have
come
down
here
to
support
the
case
of
a
poor
man
who
is
i
think
being
trampled
on
by
this
legislator
but
i
am
bound
to
say
that
the
lord
in
his
kind
is
very
much
better
than
the
poor
man
in
his
such
a
wretched
squalid
lying
cowardly
creature
i
did
not
think
that
even
england
could
produce
and
yet
the
man
has
a
property
in
land
on
which
he
ought
to
be
able
to
live
in
humble
comfort
i
feel
sure
that
i
have
leagued
myself
with
a
rascal
whereas
i
believe
the
lord
in
spite
of
his
ignorance
and
his
idleness
to
be
honest
but
yet
the
man
is
being
hardly
used
and
has
had
the
spirit
or
rather
perhaps
has
been
instigated
by
others
to
rebel
his
crops
have
been
eaten
up
by
the
lord
pheasants
and
the
lord
exercising
plenary
power
as
though
he
were
subject
to
no
laws
will
only
pay
what
compensation
he
himself
chooses
to
award
the
whole
country
here
is
in
arms
against
the
rebel
thinking
it
monstrous
that
a
man
living
in
a
hovel
should
contest
such
a
point
with
the
owner
of
palaces
i
have
come
forward
to
help
the
man
for
the
sake
of
seeing
how
the
matter
will
go
and
i
have
to
confess
that
though
those
under
the
lord
have
treated
me
as
though
i
were
a
miscreant
the
lord
himself
and
his
friends
have
been
civil
enough
i
say
what
i
think
wherever
i
go
and
i
do
not
find
it
taken
in
bad
part
in
that
respect
we
might
learn
something
even
from
englishmen
when
a
britisher
over
in
the
states
says
what
he
thinks
about
us
we
are
apt
to
be
a
little
rough
with
him
i
have
indeed
known
towns
in
which
he
could
speak
out
with
personal
safety
here
there
is
no
danger
of
that
kind
i
am
getting
together
the
materials
for
a
lecture
on
british
institutions
in
general
in
which
i
shall
certainly
speak
my
mind
plainly
and
i
think
i
shall
venture
to
deliver
it
in
london
before
i
leave
for
new
york
in
the
course
of
next
spring
i
will
however
write
to
you
again
before
that
time
comes
believe
me
to
be
dear
sir
with
much
sincerity
yours
truly
elias
gotobed
the
honble
josiah
scroome
q
street
minnesota
avenue
washington
on
the
morning
of
the
senator
departure
from
dillsborough
runciman
met
him
standing
under
the
covered
way
leading
from
the
inn
yard
into
the
street
he
was
waiting
for
the
omnibus
which
was
being
driven
about
the
town
and
which
was
to
call
for
him
and
take
him
down
to
the
railway
station
runciman
had
not
as
yet
spoken
to
him
since
he
had
been
at
the
inn
and
had
not
even
made
himself
personally
known
to
his
guest
so
sir
you
are
going
to
leave
us
said
the
landlord
with
a
smile
which
was
intended
probably
as
a
smile
of
triumph
yes
sir
said
the
senator
it
about
time
i
guess
that
i
should
get
back
to
london
i
dare
say
it
is
sir
said
the
landlord
i
dare
say
you
seen
enough
of
goarly
by
this
time
that
as
may
be
i
do
know
whom
i
have
the
pleasure
of
speaking
to
my
name
is
runciman
sir
i
the
landlord
here
i
hope
i
see
you
well
runciman
i
have
about
come
to
an
end
of
my
business
here
i
dare
say
you
have
sir
i
should
say
so
perhaps
i
might
express
an
opinion
that
you
never
came
across
a
greater
blackguard
than
goarly
either
in
this
country
or
your
own
that
a
strong
opinion
mr
runciman
it
the
general
opinion
here
sir
i
should
have
thought
found
it
out
before
this
i
do
know
that
i
am
prepared
at
this
moment
to
declare
all
that
i
have
found
out
i
thought
you
have
been
tired
of
it
by
this
time
mr
gotobed
tired
of
what
tired
of
the
wrong
side
sir
i
do
know
that
i
am
on
the
wrong
side
a
man
may
be
in
the
right
on
one
point
even
though
his
life
is
all
that
it
ought
to
be
that
true
sir
but
if
they
told
you
all
that
they
know
up
street
and
runciman
pointed
to
the
part
of
the
town
in
which
bearside
office
was
situated
i
should
have
thought
you
would
have
understood
who
was
going
to
win
and
who
was
going
to
lose
good
day
sir
i
hope
you
have
a
pleasant
journey
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
patronage
sir
and
runciman
still
smiling
unpleasantly
touched
his
hat
as
the
senator
got
into
the
omnibus
the
senator
was
not
very
happy
as
to
the
goarly
business
he
had
paid
some
money
and
had
half
promised
more
and
had
found
out
that
he
was
in
a
boat
with
thoroughly
disreputable
persons
as
he
had
said
to
the
landlord
a
man
may
have
the
right
on
his
side
in
an
action
at
law
though
he
be
a
knave
or
a
rascal
and
if
a
lord
be
unjust
to
a
poor
man
the
poor
man
should
have
justice
done
him
even
though
he
be
not
quite
a
pattern
poor
man
but
now
he
was
led
to
believe
by
what
the
landlord
had
said
to
him
that
he
was
being
kept
in
the
dark
and
that
there
were
facts
generally
known
that
he
did
not
know
he
had
learned
something
of
english
manners
and
english
institutions
by
his
interference
but
there
might
be
a
question
whether
he
was
not
paying
too
dearly
for
his
whistle
and
there
was
growing
upon
him
a
feeling
that
before
he
had
done
he
would
have
to
blush
for
his
colleagues
as
the
omnibus
went
away
nupper
joined
runciman
under
the
archway
i
blessed
if
i
can
understand
that
man
said
runciman
what
is
it
he
after
notoriety
said
the
doctor
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
has
completely
solved
a
difficult
question
he
have
to
pay
for
it
and
that
pretty
smart
said
runciman
i
never
heard
of
such
a
foolish
thing
in
all
my
life
what
the
dickens
is
it
to
him
one
can
understand
bearside
and
scrobby
too
when
a
fellow
has
something
to
get
one
does
understand
it
but
why
an
old
fellow
like
that
should
come
down
from
the
moon
to
pay
ever
so
much
money
for
such
a
man
as
goarly
is
what
i
do
understand
notoriety
said
the
doctor
he
evidently
do
know
that
nickem
has
got
round
goarly
said
the
landlord
chapter
iii
at
cheltenham
the
month
at
cheltenham
was
passed
very
quietly
and
would
have
been
a
very
happy
month
with
mary
masters
but
that
there
grew
upon
her
from
day
to
day
increasing
fears
of
what
she
would
have
to
undergo
when
she
returned
to
dillsborough
at
the
moment
when
she
was
hesitating
with
larry
twentyman
when
she
begged
him
to
wait
six
months
and
then
at
last
promised
to
give
him
an
answer
at
the
end
of
two
she
had
worked
herself
up
to
think
that
it
might
possibly
be
her
duty
to
accept
her
lover
for
the
sake
of
her
family
at
any
rate
she
had
at
that
moment
thought
that
the
question
of
duty
ought
to
be
further
considered
and
therefore
she
had
vacillated
when
the
two
delay
was
accorded
to
her
and
within
that
period
the
privilege
of
a
long
absence
from
dillsborough
she
put
the
trouble
aside
for
a
while
with
the
common
feeling
that
the
chapter
of
accidents
might
do
something
for
her
before
she
had
reached
cheltenham
the
chapter
of
accidents
had
done
much
when
reginald
morton
told
her
that
he
could
not
have
congratulated
her
on
such
prospects
and
had
explained
to
her
why
in
truth
he
had
been
angry
at
the
bridge
how
he
had
been
anxious
to
be
alone
with
her
that
he
might
learn
whether
she
were
really
engaged
to
this
man
then
she
had
known
that
her
answer
to
larry
twentyman
at
the
end
of
the
two
months
must
be
a
positive
refusal
but
as
she
became
aware
of
this
a
new
trouble
arose
and
harassed
her
very
soul
when
she
had
asked
for
the
six
months
she
had
not
at
the
moment
been
aware
she
had
not
then
felt
that
a
girl
who
asks
for
time
is
supposed
to
have
already
surrendered
but
since
she
had
made
that
unhappy
request
the
conviction
had
grown
upon
her
she
had
read
it
in
every
word
her
stepmother
said
to
her
and
in
her
manner
the
very
winks
and
hints
and
little
jokes
which
fell
from
her
younger
sisters
told
her
that
it
was
so
she
could
see
around
her
the
satisfaction
which
had
come
from
the
settlement
of
that
difficult
question
a
satisfaction
which
was
perhaps
more
apparent
with
her
father
than
even
with
the
others
then
she
knew
what
she
had
done
and
remembered
to
have
heard
that
a
girl
who
expresses
a
doubt
is
supposed
to
have
gone
beyond
doubting
while
she
was
still
at
dillsborough
there
was
a
feeling
that
no
evil
would
arise
from
this
if
she
could
at
last
make
up
her
mind
to
be
twentyman
but
when
the
settled
conviction
came
upon
her
after
hearing
reginald
words
then
she
was
much
troubled
he
stayed
only
a
couple
of
days
at
cheltenham
and
during
that
time
said
very
little
to
her
he
certainly
spoke
no
word
which
would
give
her
a
right
to
think
that
he
himself
was
attached
to
her
he
had
been
interested
about
her
as
was
his
aunt
lady
ushant
because
she
had
been
known
and
her
mother
had
been
known
by
the
old
mortons
but
there
was
nothing
of
love
in
all
that
she
had
never
supposed
that
there
would
be
and
yet
there
was
a
vague
feeling
in
her
bosom
that
as
he
had
been
strong
in
expressing
his
objection
to
twentyman
there
might
have
been
something
more
to
stir
him
than
the
memory
of
those
old
days
at
bragton
to
my
thinking
there
is
a
sweetness
about
her
which
i
have
never
seen
equalled
in
any
young
woman
this
was
said
by
lady
ushant
to
her
nephew
after
mary
had
gone
to
bed
on
the
night
before
he
left
one
would
suppose
he
answered
that
you
wanted
me
to
ask
her
to
be
my
wife
i
never
want
anything
of
that
kind
reg
i
never
make
in
such
matters
or
mar
if
i
can
help
it
there
is
a
man
at
dillsborough
wants
to
marry
her
i
can
easily
believe
that
there
should
be
two
or
three
who
is
the
man
do
you
remember
old
twentyman
of
chowton
he
was
our
near
neighbour
of
course
i
remember
him
i
can
remember
well
when
they
bought
the
land
it
is
his
son
surely
he
can
hardly
be
worthy
of
her
reg
and
yet
they
say
he
is
very
worthy
i
have
asked
about
him
and
he
is
not
a
bad
fellow
he
keeps
his
money
and
has
ideas
of
living
decently
he
does
drink
or
gamble
but
he
not
a
gentleman
or
anything
like
one
i
should
think
he
never
opens
a
book
of
course
it
would
be
a
degradation
and
what
does
mary
say
herself
i
fancy
she
has
refused
him
then
he
added
after
a
pause
indeed
i
know
she
has
how
should
you
know
has
she
told
you
in
answer
to
this
he
only
nodded
his
head
at
the
old
lady
there
must
have
been
close
friendship
reg
between
you
two
when
she
told
you
that
i
hope
you
have
not
made
her
give
up
one
suitor
by
leading
her
to
love
another
who
does
not
mean
to
ask
her
i
certainly
have
not
done
that
said
reg
men
may
often
do
much
without
knowing
that
they
do
anything
and
such
probably
had
been
the
case
with
reginald
morton
during
the
journey
from
dillsborough
to
cheltenham
what
would
her
father
wish
they
all
want
her
to
take
the
man
how
can
she
do
better
would
you
have
her
marry
a
man
who
is
not
a
gentleman
whose
wife
will
never
be
visited
by
other
ladies
in
marrying
whom
she
would
go
altogether
down
into
another
and
a
lower
world
this
was
a
matter
on
which
lady
ushant
and
her
nephew
had
conversed
often
and
he
thought
he
knew
her
to
be
thoroughly
wedded
to
the
privileges
which
she
believed
to
be
attached
to
her
birth
with
him
the
same
feeling
was
almost
the
stronger
because
he
was
so
well
aware
of
the
blot
upon
himself
caused
by
the
lowness
of
his
own
marriage
but
a
man
he
held
could
raise
a
woman
to
his
own
rank
whereas
a
woman
must
accept
the
level
of
her
husband
bread
and
meat
and
chairs
and
tables
are
very
serious
things
reg
you
would
then
recommend
her
to
take
this
man
and
pass
altogether
out
of
your
own
sphere
what
can
i
do
for
her
i
am
an
old
woman
who
will
be
dead
probably
before
the
first
five
years
of
her
married
life
have
passed
over
her
and
as
for
recommending
i
do
not
know
enough
to
recommend
anything
does
she
like
the
man
i
am
sure
she
would
feel
herself
degraded
by
marrying
him
i
trust
she
will
never
live
to
feel
herself
degraded
i
do
not
believe
that
she
could
do
anything
that
she
thought
would
degrade
her
but
i
think
that
you
and
i
had
better
leave
her
to
herself
in
this
matter
further
on
in
the
same
evening
or
rather
late
in
the
night
for
they
had
then
sat
talking
together
for
hours
over
the
fire
she
made
a
direct
statement
to
him
when
i
die
reg
i
have
but
to
leave
behind
me
and
this
i
have
divided
between
you
and
her
i
shall
not
tell
her
because
i
might
do
more
harm
than
good
but
you
may
know
that
would
make
no
difference
to
me
he
said
very
likely
not
but
i
wish
you
to
know
it
what
troubles
me
is
that
she
will
have
to
pay
so
much
out
of
it
for
legacy
duty
i
might
leave
it
all
to
you
and
you
could
give
it
her
an
honester
or
more
religious
or
better
woman
than
old
lady
ushant
there
was
not
in
cheltenham
but
it
never
crossed
her
conscience
that
it
would
be
wrong
to
cheat
the
revenue
it
may
be
doubted
whether
any
woman
has
ever
been
brought
to
such
honesty
as
that
on
the
next
morning
morton
went
away
without
saying
another
word
in
private
to
mary
masters
and
she
was
left
to
her
quiet
life
with
the
old
lady
to
an
ordinary
visitor
nothing
could
have
been
less
exciting
for
lady
ushant
very
seldom
went
out
and
never
entertained
company
she
was
a
tall
thin
old
lady
with
bright
eyes
and
grey
hair
and
a
face
that
was
still
pretty
in
spite
of
sunken
eyes
and
sunken
cheeks
and
wrinkled
brow
there
was
ever
present
with
her
an
air
of
melancholy
which
told
a
whole
tale
of
the
sadness
of
a
long
life
her
chief
excitement
was
in
her
two
visits
to
church
on
sunday
and
in
the
letter
which
she
wrote
every
week
to
her
nephew
at
dillsborough
now
she
had
her
young
friend
with
her
and
that
too
was
an
excitement
to
her
and
the
more
so
since
she
had
heard
the
tidings
of
larry
twentyman
courtship
she
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
not
speak
on
the
subject
to
her
young
friend
unless
her
young
friend
should
speak
to
her
in
the
first
three
weeks
nothing
was
said
but
four
or
five
days
before
mary
departure
there
came
up
a
conversation
about
dillsborough
and
bragton
there
had
been
many
conversations
about
dillsborough
and
bragton
but
in
all
of
them
the
name
of
lawrence
twentyman
had
been
scrupulously
avoided
each
had
longed
to
name
him
and
yet
each
had
determined
not
to
do
so
but
at
length
it
was
avoided
no
longer
lady
ushant
had
spoken
of
chowton
farm
and
the
widow
then
mary
had
spoken
of
the
place
and
its
inhabitants
twentyman
comes
a
great
deal
to
our
house
now
she
said
has
he
any
reason
my
dear
he
goes
with
papa
once
a
week
to
the
club
and
he
sometimes
lends
my
sister
kate
a
pony
kate
is
very
fond
of
riding
there
is
nothing
else
he
has
got
to
be
intimate
and
i
think
mamma
likes
him
he
is
a
good
young
man
then
very
good
said
mary
with
an
emphasis
and
chowton
belongs
to
him
oh
yes
it
belongs
to
him
some
young
men
make
such
ducks
and
drakes
of
their
property
when
they
get
it
they
say
that
he
not
like
that
at
all
people
say
that
he
understands
farming
very
well
and
that
he
minds
everything
himself
what
an
excellent
young
man
there
is
no
other
reason
for
his
coming
to
your
house
mary
then
the
were
opened
and
the
whole
story
was
told
sitting
there
late
into
the
night
mary
told
it
all
as
well
as
she
knew
how
all
of
it
except
in
regard
to
any
spark
of
love
which
might
have
fallen
upon
her
in
respect
of
reginald
morton
of
reginald
morton
in
her
story
of
course
she
did
not
speak
but
all
the
rest
she
declared
she
did
not
love
the
man
she
was
quite
sure
of
that
though
she
thought
so
well
of
him
there
was
she
was
quite
sure
no
feeling
in
her
heart
akin
to
love
she
had
promised
to
take
time
because
she
had
thought
that
she
might
perhaps
be
able
to
bring
herself
to
marry
him
without
loving
him
to
marry
him
because
her
father
wished
it
and
because
her
going
from
home
would
be
a
relief
to
her
stepmother
and
sisters
because
it
would
be
well
for
them
all
that
she
should
be
settled
out
of
the
way
but
since
that
she
had
made
up
her
mind
she
thought
that
she
had
quite
made
up
her
mind
that
it
would
be
impossible
there
is
nobody
else
mary
said
lady
ushant
putting
her
hand
on
to
mary
lap
mary
protested
that
there
was
nobody
else
without
any
consciousness
that
she
was
telling
a
falsehood
and
you
are
quite
sure
that
you
can
not
do
it
do
you
think
that
i
ought
lady
ushant
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
say
that
my
dear
a
young
woman
in
such
a
matter
must
be
governed
by
her
feelings
only
he
seems
to
be
a
deserving
young
man
mary
looked
askance
at
her
friend
remembering
at
the
moment
reginald
morton
assurance
that
his
aunt
would
have
disapproved
of
such
an
engagement
but
i
never
would
persuade
a
girl
to
marry
a
man
she
did
not
love
i
think
it
would
be
wicked
i
always
thought
so
there
was
nothing
about
degradation
in
all
this
it
was
quite
clear
to
mary
that
had
she
been
able
to
tell
lady
ushant
that
she
was
head
over
ears
in
love
with
this
young
man
and
that
therefore
she
was
going
to
marry
him
her
old
friend
would
have
found
no
reason
to
lament
such
an
arrangement
her
old
friend
would
have
congratulated
her
lady
ushant
evidently
thought
larry
twentyman
to
be
good
enough
as
soon
as
she
heard
what
mary
found
herself
compelled
to
say
in
the
young
man
favour
mary
was
almost
disappointed
but
reconciled
herself
to
it
very
quickly
telling
herself
that
there
was
yet
time
for
her
to
decide
in
favour
of
her
lover
if
she
could
bring
herself
to
do
so
and
she
did
try
that
night
and
all
the
next
day
thinking
that
if
she
could
so
make
up
her
mind
she
would
declare
her
purpose
to
lady
ushant
before
she
left
cheltenham
but
she
could
not
do
it
and
in
the
struggle
with
herself
at
last
she
learned
something
of
the
truth
lady
ushant
saw
nothing
but
what
was
right
and
proper
in
a
marriage
with
lawrence
twentyman
but
reginald
morton
had
declared
it
to
be
improper
and
therefore
it
was
out
of
her
reach
she
could
not
do
it
she
could
not
bring
herself
after
what
he
had
said
to
look
him
in
the
face
and
tell
him
that
she
was
going
to
become
the
wife
of
larry
twentyman
then
she
asked
herself
the
fatal
question
was
she
in
love
with
reginald
morton
i
do
not
think
that
she
answered
it
in
the
affirmative
but
she
became
more
and
more
sure
that
she
could
never
marry
larry
twentyman
lady
ushant
declared
herself
to
have
been
more
than
satisfied
with
the
visit
and
expressed
a
hope
that
it
might
be
repeated
in
the
next
year
i
would
ask
you
to
come
and
make
your
home
here
while
i
have
a
home
to
offer
you
only
that
you
would
be
so
much
more
buried
here
than
at
dillsborough
and
you
have
duties
there
which
perhaps
you
ought
not
to
leave
but
come
again
when
your
papa
will
spare
you
on
her
journey
back
she
certainly
was
not
very
happy
there
were
yet
three
weeks
wanting
to
the
time
at
which
she
would
be
bound
to
give
her
answer
to
larry
twentyman
but
why
should
she
keep
the
man
waiting
for
three
weeks
when
her
answer
was
ready
her
stepmother
she
knew
would
soon
force
her
answer
from
her
and
her
father
would
be
anxious
to
know
what
had
been
the
result
of
her
meditations
the
real
period
of
her
reprieve
had
been
that
of
her
absence
at
cheltenham
and
that
period
was
now
come
to
an
end
at
each
station
as
she
passed
them
she
remembered
what
reginald
morton
had
been
saying
to
her
and
how
their
conversation
had
been
interrupted
and
perhaps
occasionally
aided
by
the
absurdities
of
the
bird
how
sweet
it
had
been
to
be
near
him
and
to
listen
to
his
whispered
voice
how
great
was
the
difference
between
him
and
that
other
young
man
the
smartness
of
whose
apparel
was
now
becoming
peculiarly
distasteful
to
her
certainly
it
would
have
been
better
for
her
not
to
have
gone
to
cheltenham
if
it
was
to
be
her
fate
to
become
twentyman
she
was
quite
sure
of
that
now
she
came
up
from
the
dillsborough
station
alone
in
the
bush
omnibus
she
had
not
expected
any
one
to
meet
her
why
should
any
one
meet
her
the
porter
put
up
her
box
and
the
omnibus
left
her
at
the
door
but
she
remembered
well
how
she
had
gone
down
with
reginald
morton
and
how
delightful
had
been
every
little
incident
of
the
journey
even
to
walk
with
him
up
and
down
the
platform
while
waiting
for
the
train
had
been
a
privilege
she
thought
of
it
as
she
got
out
of
the
carriage
and
remembered
that
she
had
felt
that
the
train
had
come
too
soon
at
her
own
door
her
father
met
her
and
took
her
into
the
parlour
where
the
were
spread
and
where
her
sisters
were
already
seated
her
stepmother
soon
came
in
and
kissed
her
kindly
she
was
asked
how
she
had
enjoyed
herself
and
no
disagreeable
questions
were
put
to
her
that
night
no
questions
at
least
were
asked
which
she
felt
herself
bound
to
answer
after
she
was
in
bed
kate
came
to
her
and
did
say
a
word
well
mary
do
tell
me
i
wo
tell
any
one
but
mary
refused
to
speak
a
word
chapter
iv
the
rufford
correspondence
it
might
be
surmised
from
the
description
which
lord
rufford
had
given
of
his
own
position
to
his
sister
and
his
sister
two
friends
when
he
pictured
himself
as
falling
over
the
edge
of
the
precipice
while
they
hung
on
behind
to
save
him
that
he
was
sufficiently
aware
of
the
inexpediency
of
the
proposed
intimacy
with
miss
trefoil
any
one
hearing
him
would
have
said
that
miss
trefoil
chances
in
that
direction
were
very
poor
that
a
man
seeing
his
danger
so
plainly
and
so
clearly
understanding
the
nature
of
it
would
certainly
avoid
it
but
what
he
had
said
was
no
more
than
miss
trefoil
knew
that
he
would
say
or
at
any
rate
would
think
of
course
she
had
against
her
not
only
all
his
friends
but
the
man
himself
also
and
his
own
fixed
intentions
lord
rufford
was
not
a
marrying
man
which
was
supposed
to
signify
that
he
intended
to
lead
a
life
of
pleasure
till
the
necessity
of
providing
an
heir
should
be
forced
upon
him
when
he
would
take
to
himself
a
wife
out
of
his
own
class
in
life
twenty
years
younger
than
himself
for
whom
he
would
not
care
a
straw
the
odds
against
miss
trefoil
were
of
course
great
but
girls
have
won
even
against
such
odds
as
these
she
knew
her
own
powers
and
was
aware
that
lord
rufford
was
fond
of
feminine
beauty
and
feminine
flutter
and
feminine
flattery
though
he
was
not
prepared
to
marry
it
was
quite
possible
that
she
might
be
able
to
dig
such
a
pit
for
him
that
it
would
be
easier
for
him
to
marry
her
than
to
get
out
in
any
other
way
of
course
she
must
trust
something
to
his
own
folly
at
first
nor
did
she
trust
in
vain
before
her
week
was
over
at
gore
she
received
from
him
a
letter
which
with
the
correspondence
to
which
it
immediately
led
shall
be
given
in
this
chapter
letter
no
rufford
sunday
my
dear
miss
trefoil
we
have
had
a
sad
house
since
you
left
us
poor
caneback
got
better
and
then
worse
and
then
better
and
at
last
died
yesterday
afternoon
and
now
there
is
to
be
the
funeral
the
poor
dear
old
boy
seems
to
have
had
nobody
belonging
to
him
and
very
little
in
the
way
of
possessions
i
never
knew
anything
of
him
except
that
he
was
or
had
been
in
the
blues
and
that
he
was
about
the
best
man
in
england
to
hounds
on
a
bad
horse
it
now
turns
out
that
his
father
made
some
money
in
india
a
sort
of
commissary
purveyor
and
bought
a
commission
for
him
years
ago
everybody
knew
him
but
nobody
knew
anything
about
him
poor
old
caneback
i
wish
he
had
managed
to
die
anywhere
else
and
i
do
feel
at
all
obliged
to
purefoy
for
sending
that
brute
of
a
mare
here
he
said
something
to
me
about
that
wretched
ball
not
altogether
so
wretched
was
it
but
i
did
like
what
he
said
and
told
him
a
bit
of
my
mind
now
we
two
for
a
while
and
i
do
care
for
how
long
unless
he
comes
round
i
can
not
stand
a
funeral
and
i
shall
get
away
from
this
i
will
pay
the
bill
and
purefoy
may
do
the
rest
i
going
for
christmas
to
surbiton
near
melton
with
a
string
of
horses
surbiton
is
a
bachelor
and
as
there
will
be
no
young
ladies
to
interfere
with
me
i
shall
have
the
more
time
to
think
of
you
we
shall
have
a
little
play
there
instead
i
do
know
whether
it
is
the
better
of
the
two
as
if
one
does
get
sat
upon
one
does
feel
so
confoundedly
i
have
been
out
with
the
hounds
two
or
three
times
since
you
went
as
i
could
do
no
good
staying
with
that
poor
fellow
and
there
was
a
time
when
we
thought
he
would
have
pulled
through
i
rode
jack
one
day
but
he
did
carry
me
as
well
as
he
did
you
i
think
more
of
a
lady
horse
if
i
go
to
mistletoe
i
shall
have
some
horses
somewhere
in
the
neighbourhood
and
i
make
them
take
jack
so
that
you
may
have
a
chance
i
never
know
how
to
sign
myself
to
young
ladies
suppose
i
say
that
i
am
yours
anything
you
like
best
this
was
a
much
nicer
letter
than
arabella
had
expected
as
there
were
one
or
two
touches
in
it
apart
from
the
dead
man
and
the
horses
which
she
thought
might
lead
to
something
and
there
was
a
tone
in
the
letter
which
seemed
to
show
that
he
was
given
to
correspondence
she
took
care
to
answer
it
so
that
he
should
get
her
letter
on
his
arrival
at
surbiton
house
she
found
out
surbiton
address
and
then
gave
a
great
deal
of
time
to
her
letter

thursday
my
dear
lord
rufford
as
we
are
passing
through
london
on
our
way
from
one
purgatory
with
the
gores
to
another
purgatory
with
old
lady
de
browne
and
as
mamma
is
asleep
in
her
chair
opposite
and
as
i
have
nothing
else
on
earth
to
do
i
think
i
might
as
well
answer
your
letter
poor
old
major
i
am
sorry
for
him
because
he
rode
so
bravely
i
shall
never
forget
his
face
as
he
passed
us
and
again
as
he
rose
upon
his
knee
when
that
horrid
blow
came
how
very
odd
that
he
should
have
been
like
that
without
any
friends
what
a
terrible
nuisance
to
you
i
think
you
were
quite
wise
to
come
away
i
am
sure
i
should
have
done
so
i
ca
conceive
what
right
sir
john
purefoy
can
have
had
to
say
anything
for
after
all
it
was
his
doing
do
you
remember
when
you
talked
of
my
riding
jemima
when
i
think
of
it
i
can
hardly
hold
myself
for
shuddering
it
is
so
kind
of
you
to
think
of
me
about
jack
i
am
never
very
fond
of
mistletoe
do
you
be
mischievous
now
and
tell
the
duchess
i
said
so
but
with
jack
in
the
neighbourhood
i
can
stand
even
her
grace
i
think
i
shall
be
there
about
the
middle
of
january
but
it
must
depend
on
all
those
people
mamma
is
going
to
i
shall
have
to
make
a
great
fight
for
mamma
thinks
that
ten
days
in
the
year
at
mistletoe
is
all
that
duty
requires
but
i
always
stick
up
for
my
uncle
and
mean
in
this
instance
to
have
a
little
of
my
own
way
what
are
parental
commands
in
opposition
to
jack
and
all
his
glories
besides
mamma
does
not
mean
to
go
herself
i
shall
leave
it
to
you
to
say
whether
the
ball
was
altogether
wretched
of
course
there
must
have
been
infinite
vexation
to
you
and
to
us
who
knew
of
it
all
there
was
a
feeling
of
deep
sorrow
but
perhaps
we
were
able
some
of
us
to
make
it
a
little
lighter
for
you
at
any
rate
i
shall
never
forget
rufford
whether
the
memory
be
more
pleasant
or
more
painful
there
are
moments
which
one
never
can
forget
do
go
and
gamble
away
your
money
among
a
lot
of
men
though
i
dare
say
you
have
got
so
much
that
it
signify
whether
you
lose
some
of
it
or
not
i
do
think
it
is
such
a
shame
that
a
man
like
you
should
have
such
a
quantity
and
that
a
poor
girl
such
as
i
am
have
enough
to
pay
for
her
hats
and
gloves
why
i
send
a
string
of
horses
about
just
when
i
please
i
believe
i
could
make
as
good
a
use
of
them
as
you
do
and
then
i
could
lend
you
jack
i
would
be
so
you
should
have
jack
every
day
you
wanted
him
you
must
write
and
tell
me
what
day
you
will
be
at
mistletoe
it
is
you
that
have
tempted
me
and
i
do
mean
to
be
there
without
you
or
i
suppose
i
ought
to
say
without
the
horse
but
of
course
you
will
have
understood
that
no
young
lady
ever
is
supposed
to
desire
the
presence
of
any
young
man
it
would
be
very
improper
of
course
but
a
young
man
jack
is
quite
another
thing
so
far
her
pen
had
flown
with
her
but
then
there
came
the
necessity
for
a
conclusion
which
must
be
worded
in
some
peculiar
way
as
his
had
been
so
peculiar
how
far
might
she
dare
to
be
affectionate
without
putting
him
on
his
guard
or
in
what
way
might
she
be
saucy
so
as
best
to
please
him
she
tried
two
or
three
and
at
last
she
ended
her
letter
as
follows
i
have
not
had
much
experience
in
signing
myself
to
young
gentlemen
and
am
therefore
quite
in
as
great
a
difficulty
as
you
were
but
though
i
ca
swear
that
i
am
everything
that
you
like
best
i
will
protest
that
i
am
pretty
nearly
what
you
ought
to
like
as
far
as
young
ladies
go
in
the
meantime
i
certainly
am
yours
truly
mind
you
write
about
jack
and
address
to
lady
smijth
greenacres
manor
hastings
there
was
a
great
deal
in
this
letter
which
was
not
true
but
then
such
ladies
as
miss
trefoil
can
never
afford
to
tell
the
truth
the
letter
was
not
written
from
murray
hotel
lady
augustus
having
insisted
on
staying
at
certain
lodgings
in
orchard
street
because
her
funds
were
low
but
on
previous
occasions
they
had
stayed
at
murray
and
her
mamma
instead
of
being
asleep
when
the
letter
was
written
was
making
up
her
accounts
and
every
word
about
mistletoe
had
been
false
she
had
not
yet
secured
her
invitation
she
was
hard
at
work
on
the
attempt
having
induced
her
father
absolutely
to
beg
the
favour
from
his
brother
but
at
the
present
moment
she
was
altogether
diffident
of
success
should
she
fail
she
must
only
tell
lord
rufford
that
her
mother
numerous
engagements
had
at
the
last
moment
made
her
happiness
impossible
that
she
was
going
to
lady
smijth
was
true
and
at
lady
smijth
house
she
received
the
following
note
from
lord
rufford
it
was
then
january
and
the
great
mistletoe
question
was
not
as
yet
settled
letter
no
december
my
dear
miss
trefoil
here
i
am
still
at
surbiton
and
we
have
had
such
good
sport
that
i
half
inclined
to
give
the
duke
the
slip
what
a
pity
that
you
ca
come
here
instead
it
be
nice
for
you
and
half
a
dozen
more
without
any
of
the
dowagers
or
duennas
you
might
win
some
of
the
money
which
i
lose
i
have
been
very
unlucky
and
if
you
had
won
it
all
there
would
be
plenty
of
room
for
hats
and
gloves
and
for
sending
two
or
three
jacks
about
all
the
winter
into
the
bargain
i
never
did
win
yet
i
do
care
very
much
about
it
but
i
do
know
why
i
should
always
be
so
uncommonly
unlucky
we
had
such
a
day
yesterday
an
hour
and
ten
minutes
all
in
the
open
and
then
a
kill
just
as
the
poor
fellow
was
trying
to
make
a
drain
under
the
high
road
there
were
only
five
of
us
up
surbiton
broke
his
horse
back
at
a
bank
and
young
de
canute
came
down
on
to
a
road
and
smashed
his
collar
bone
three
or
four
of
the
hounds
were
so
done
that
they
could
be
got
home
i
was
riding
black
harry
and
he
wo
be
out
again
for
a
fortnight
it
was
the
best
thing
i
seen
these
two
years
we
never
have
it
quite
like
that
with
the
u
if
i
do
go
to
mistletoe
i
send
jack
and
a
groom
if
you
think
the
duke
would
take
them
in
and
let
you
ride
the
horse
if
so
i
shall
stay
here
pretty
nearly
all
january
unless
there
should
be
a
frost
in
that
case
i
should
go
back
to
rufford
as
i
have
a
deal
of
shooting
to
do
i
shall
be
so
sorry
not
to
see
you
but
there
is
always
a
sort
of
sin
in
not
sticking
to
hunting
when
it
good
it
so
seldom
is
just
what
it
ought
to
be
i
rather
think
that
after
all
we
shall
be
down
on
that
fellow
who
poisoned
our
fox
in
spite
of
your
friend
the
senator
yours
always
faithfully
there
was
a
great
deal
in
this
letter
which
was
quite
terrible
to
miss
trefoil
in
the
first
place
by
the
time
she
received
it
she
had
managed
the
matter
with
her
uncle
her
father
had
altogether
refused
to
mention
lord
rufford
name
though
he
had
heard
the
very
plain
proposition
which
his
daughter
made
to
him
with
perfect
serenity
but
he
had
said
to
the
duke
that
it
would
be
a
great
convenience
if
bell
could
be
received
at
mistletoe
for
a
few
days
and
the
duke
had
got
the
duchess
to
assent
lady
augustus
too
had
been
disposed
of
and
two
very
handsome
new
dresses
had
been
acquired
her
habit
had
been
altered
with
reckless
disregard
of
the
coming
spring
and
she
was
fully
prepared
for
her
campaign
but
what
would
mistletoe
be
to
her
without
lord
rufford
in
spite
of
all
that
had
been
done
she
would
not
go
there
unless
she
could
turn
him
by
her
entreaties
she
would
pack
up
everything
and
start
for
patagonia
with
the
determination
to
throw
herself
overboard
on
the
way
there
if
she
could
find
the
courage
she
had
to
think
very
much
of
her
next
letter
should
she
write
in
anger
or
should
she
write
in
love
or
should
she
mingle
both
there
was
no
need
for
care
now
as
there
had
been
at
first
she
must
reach
him
at
once
or
everything
would
be
over
she
must
say
something
that
would
bring
him
to
mistletoe
whatever
that
something
might
be
after
much
thought
she
determined
that
mingled
anger
and
love
would
be
the
best
so
she
mingled
them
as
follows
letter
no
greenacre
manor
monday
your
last
letter
which
i
have
just
got
has
killed
me
you
must
know
that
i
have
altered
my
plans
and
done
it
at
immense
trouble
for
the
sake
of
meeting
you
at
mistletoe
it
will
be
most
unkind
i
might
say
worse
if
you
put
me
off
i
do
think
you
can
do
it
as
a
gentleman
i
sure
you
would
not
if
you
knew
what
i
have
gone
through
with
mamma
and
the
whole
set
of
them
to
arrange
it
of
course
i
sha
go
if
you
do
come
your
talk
of
sending
the
horse
there
is
adding
an
insult
to
the
injury
you
must
have
meant
to
annoy
me
or
you
would
have
pretended
to
suppose
that
it
was
the
horse
i
wanted
to
see
i
think
i
could
have
taken
so
violent
a
dislike
to
poor
jack
as
i
did
for
a
moment
let
me
tell
you
that
i
think
you
are
bound
to
go
to
mistletoe
though
the
hunting
at
melton
should
be
better
than
was
ever
known
before
when
the
hunting
is
good
in
one
place
of
course
it
is
good
in
another
even
i
am
sportsman
enough
to
know
that
i
suppose
you
have
been
losing
a
lot
of
money
and
are
foolish
enough
to
think
you
can
win
it
back
again
please
please
come
it
was
to
be
the
little
cream
of
the
year
for
me
it
was
jack
there
that
ought
to
bring
you
and
yet
if
you
come
i
will
worship
jack
i
have
not
said
a
word
to
mamma
about
altering
my
plans
nor
shall
i
while
there
is
a
hope
but
to
mistletoe
i
will
not
go
unless
you
are
to
be
there
pray
answer
this
by
return
of
post
if
we
have
gone
your
letter
will
of
course
follow
us
pray
come
yours
if
you
do
come
what
shall
i
say
fill
it
as
you
please
lord
rufford
when
he
received
the
above
very
ardent
epistle
was
quite
aware
that
he
had
better
not
go
to
mistletoe
he
understood
the
matter
nearly
as
well
as
arabella
did
herself
but
there
was
a
feeling
with
him
that
up
to
that
stage
of
the
affair
he
ought
to
do
what
he
was
asked
by
a
young
lady
even
though
there
might
be
danger
though
there
was
danger
there
would
still
be
amusement
he
therefore
wrote
again
as
follows
letter
no
dear
miss
trefoil
you
sha
be
disappointed
whether
it
be
jack
or
any
less
useful
animal
that
you
wish
to
see
at
any
rate
jack
and
the
other
animal
will
be
at
mistletoe
on
the
i
have
written
to
the
duke
by
this
post
i
can
only
hope
that
you
will
be
grateful
after
all
your
abuse
about
my
getting
back
my
money
i
think
you
ought
to
be
very
grateful
i
have
got
it
back
again
but
i
can
assure
you
that
has
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
yours
ever
we
had
two
miserably
abortive
days
last
week
arabella
felt
that
a
great
deal
of
the
compliment
was
taken
away
by
the
postscript
but
still
she
was
grateful
and
contented
chapter
it
is
a
long
way
while
the
correspondence
given
in
the
last
chapter
was
going
on
miss
trefoil
had
other
troubles
besides
those
there
narrated
and
other
letters
to
answer
soon
after
her
departure
from
rufford
she
received
a
very
serious
but
still
an
affectionate
epistle
from
john
morton
in
which
he
asked
her
if
it
was
her
intention
to
become
his
wife
or
not
the
letter
was
very
long
as
well
as
very
serious
and
need
not
be
given
here
at
length
but
that
was
the
gist
of
it
and
he
went
on
to
say
that
in
regard
to
money
he
had
made
the
most
liberal
proposition
in
his
power
that
he
must
decline
to
have
any
further
communication
with
lawyers
and
that
he
must
ask
her
to
let
him
know
at
once
quite
at
once
whether
she
did
or
did
not
regard
herself
as
engaged
to
him
it
was
a
manly
letter
and
ended
by
a
declaration
that
as
far
as
he
himself
was
concerned
his
feelings
were
not
at
all
altered
this
she
received
while
staying
at
the
gores
but
in
accordance
with
her
predetermined
strategy
did
not
at
once
send
any
answer
to
it
before
she
heard
again
from
morton
she
had
received
that
pleasant
first
letter
from
lord
rufford
and
was
certainly
then
in
no
frame
of
mind
to
assure
morton
that
she
was
ready
to
declare
herself
his
affianced
wife
before
all
the
world
then
after
ten
days
he
had
written
to
her
again
and
had
written
much
more
severely
it
wanted
at
that
time
but
a
few
days
to
christmas
and
she
was
waiting
for
a
second
letter
from
lord
rufford
let
what
might
come
of
it
she
could
not
now
give
up
the
rufford
chance
as
she
sat
thinking
of
it
giving
the
very
best
of
her
mind
to
it
she
remembered
the
warmth
of
that
embrace
in
the
little
room
behind
the
and
those
halcyon
minutes
in
which
her
head
had
been
on
his
shoulder
and
his
arm
round
her
waist
not
that
they
were
made
halcyon
to
her
by
any
of
the
joys
of
love
in
giving
the
girl
her
due
it
must
be
owned
that
she
rarely
allowed
herself
to
indulge
in
simple
pleasures
if
lord
rufford
with
the
same
rank
and
property
had
been
personally
disagreeable
to
her
it
would
have
been
the
same
business
to
her
had
for
many
years
been
business
and
her
business
had
been
so
very
hard
that
she
had
never
allowed
lighter
things
to
interfere
with
it
she
had
had
justice
on
her
side
when
she
rebuked
her
mother
for
accusing
her
of
flirtations
but
could
such
a
man
as
lord
rufford
with
his
hands
so
free
venture
to
tell
himself
that
such
tokens
of
affection
with
such
a
girl
would
mean
nothing
if
she
might
contrive
to
meet
him
again
of
course
they
would
be
repeated
and
then
he
should
be
forced
to
say
that
they
did
mean
something
when
therefore
the
severe
letter
came
from
morton
severe
and
pressing
telling
her
that
she
was
bound
to
answer
him
at
once
and
that
were
she
still
silent
he
must
in
regard
to
his
own
honour
take
that
as
an
indication
of
her
intention
to
break
off
the
match
she
felt
that
she
must
answer
it
the
answer
must
however
still
be
ambiguous
she
would
not
if
possible
throw
away
that
stool
quite
as
yet
though
her
mind
was
intent
on
ascending
to
the
throne
which
it
might
be
within
her
power
to
reach
she
wrote
to
him
an
ambiguous
letter
but
a
letter
which
certainly
was
not
intended
to
liberate
him
he
ought
she
said
to
understand
that
a
girl
situated
as
she
was
could
not
ultimately
dispose
of
herself
till
her
friends
had
told
her
that
she
was
free
to
do
so
she
herself
did
not
pretend
to
have
any
interest
in
the
affairs
as
to
which
her
father
and
his
lawyers
were
making
themselves
busy
they
had
never
even
condescended
to
tell
her
what
it
was
they
wanted
on
her
behalf
nor
for
the
matter
of
that
had
he
morton
ever
told
her
what
it
was
that
he
refused
to
do
of
course
she
could
not
throw
herself
into
his
arms
till
these
things
were
settled
by
that
expression
she
had
meant
a
metaphorical
throwing
of
herself
and
not
such
a
flesh
and
blood
embracing
as
she
had
permitted
to
the
lord
in
the
little
room
at
rufford
then
she
suggested
that
he
should
appeal
again
to
her
father
it
need
hardly
be
said
that
her
father
knew
very
little
about
it
and
that
the
lawyers
had
long
since
written
to
lady
augustus
to
say
that
better
terms
as
to
settlement
could
not
be
had
from
john
morton
morton
when
he
wrote
his
second
letter
had
received
the
offer
of
the
mission
to
patagonia
and
had
asked
for
a
few
days
to
think
of
it
after
much
consideration
he
had
determined
that
he
would
say
nothing
to
arabella
of
the
offer
her
treatment
of
him
gave
her
no
right
to
be
consulted
should
she
at
once
write
back
declaring
her
readiness
to
become
his
wife
then
he
would
consult
her
and
would
not
only
consult
her
but
would
be
prepared
to
abandon
the
mission
at
the
expression
of
her
lightest
wish
indeed
in
that
case
he
thought
that
he
would
himself
advise
that
it
should
be
abandoned
why
should
he
expatriate
himself
to
such
a
place
with
such
a
wife
as
arabella
trefoil
he
received
her
answer
and
at
once
accepted
the
offer
he
accepted
it
though
he
by
no
means
assured
himself
that
the
engagement
was
irrevocably
annulled
but
now
if
she
came
to
him
she
must
take
her
chance
she
must
be
told
that
he
at
any
rate
was
going
to
patagonia
and
that
unless
she
could
make
up
her
mind
to
do
so
too
she
must
remain
arabella
trefoil
for
him
he
would
not
even
tell
her
of
his
appointment
he
had
done
all
that
in
him
lay
and
would
prepare
himself
for
his
journey
as
a
single
man
a
minister
going
out
to
patagonia
would
of
course
have
some
little
leave
of
absence
allowed
him
and
he
arranged
with
his
friend
mounser
green
that
he
should
not
start
till
april
but
when
lord
rufford
second
letter
reached
miss
trefoil
down
at
greenacre
manor
where
she
had
learned
by
common
report
that
morton
was
to
be
the
new
minister
at
patagonia
when
she
believed
as
she
then
did
that
the
lord
was
escaping
her
that
seeing
and
feeling
his
danger
he
had
determined
not
to
jump
into
the
lion
mouth
by
meeting
her
at
mistletoe
that
her
chance
there
was
all
over
then
she
remembered
her
age
her
many
seasons
the
hard
work
of
her
toilet
those
tedious
long
and
bitter
quarrels
with
her
mother
the
trouble
of
her
smiles
the
hopelessness
of
her
future
should
she
smile
in
vain
to
the
last
and
the
countless
miseries
of
her
endless
visitings
and
she
remembered
too
the
a
year
that
morton
had
offered
to
settle
on
her
and
the
assurance
of
a
home
of
her
own
though
that
home
should
be
at
bragton
for
an
hour
or
two
she
had
almost
given
up
the
hope
of
rufford
and
had
meditated
some
letter
to
her
other
lover
which
might
at
any
rate
secure
him
but
she
had
collected
her
courage
sufficiently
to
make
that
last
appeal
to
the
lord
which
had
been
successful
three
weeks
now
might
settle
all
that
and
for
three
weeks
it
might
still
be
possible
so
to
manage
her
affairs
that
she
might
fall
back
upon
patagonia
as
her
last
resource
about
this
time
morton
returned
to
bragton
waiting
however
till
he
was
assured
that
the
senator
had
completed
his
visit
to
dillsborough
he
had
been
a
little
ashamed
of
the
senator
in
regard
to
the
great
goarly
conflict
and
was
not
desirous
of
relieving
his
solitude
by
the
presence
of
the
american
on
this
occasion
he
went
quite
alone
and
ordered
no
carriages
from
the
bush
and
no
increased
establishment
of
servants
he
certainly
was
not
happy
in
his
mind
the
mission
to
patagonia
was
well
paid
being
worth
with
house
and
etceteras
nearly
a
year
and
it
was
great
and
quick
promotion
for
one
so
young
as
himself
for
one
neither
a
lord
nor
connected
with
a
cabinet
minister
patagonia
was
a
great
place
at
which
to
begin
his
career
as
plenipotentiary
on
his
own
bottom
but
it
is
a
long
way
off
and
has
its
drawbacks
he
could
not
look
to
be
there
for
less
than
four
years
and
there
was
hardly
reason
why
a
man
in
his
position
should
expatriate
himself
to
such
a
place
for
so
long
a
time
he
felt
that
he
should
not
have
gone
but
for
his
engagement
to
arabella
trefoil
and
that
neither
would
he
have
gone
had
his
engagement
been
solid
and
permanent
he
was
going
in
order
that
he
might
be
rid
of
that
trouble
and
a
man
feelings
in
such
circumstances
can
not
be
satisfactory
to
himself
however
he
had
said
that
he
would
go
and
he
knew
enough
of
himself
to
be
certain
that
having
said
so
he
would
not
alter
his
mind
but
he
was
very
melancholy
and
hopkins
declared
to
old
twentyman
that
the
young
squire
was
hipped
along
of
his
lady
love
as
she
thought
his
hands
had
been
so
full
of
his
visitors
when
at
bragton
before
and
he
had
been
carried
off
so
suddenly
to
rufford
and
then
had
hurried
up
to
london
in
such
misery
that
he
had
hardly
had
time
to
attend
to
his
own
business
masters
had
made
a
claim
upon
him
since
he
had
been
in
england
for
in
reference
to
certain
affairs
in
which
the
attorney
declared
he
had
been
badly
treated
by
those
who
had
administered
the
morton
estate
john
morton
had
promised
to
look
into
the
matter
and
to
see
masters
he
had
partially
looked
into
it
and
now
felt
ashamed
that
he
had
not
fully
kept
his
promise
the
old
attorney
had
not
had
much
hope
of
getting
his
money
it
was
doubtful
to
himself
whether
he
could
make
good
his
claim
against
the
squire
at
law
and
it
was
his
settled
purpose
to
make
no
such
attempt
although
he
was
quite
sure
that
the
money
was
his
due
indeed
if
morton
would
not
do
anything
further
in
the
matter
neither
would
he
he
was
almost
too
mild
a
man
to
be
a
successful
lawyer
and
had
a
dislike
to
asking
for
money
morton
had
promised
to
see
him
but
morton
had
probably
forgotten
it
some
gentlemen
seem
apt
to
forget
such
promises
masters
was
somewhat
surprised
therefore
when
he
was
told
one
morning
in
his
office
that
morton
from
bragton
wished
to
see
him
he
thought
that
it
must
be
reginald
morton
having
not
heard
that
the
squire
had
returned
to
the
country
but
john
morton
was
shown
into
the
office
and
the
old
attorney
immediately
arose
from
his
sundown
was
there
and
was
at
once
sent
out
of
the
room
sundown
on
such
occasions
was
accustomed
to
retire
to
some
settlement
seldom
visited
by
the
public
which
was
called
the
back
office
nickem
was
away
intent
on
unravelling
the
goarly
mystery
and
the
attorney
could
ask
his
visitor
to
take
a
confidential
seat
morton
however
had
very
little
to
say
he
was
full
of
apologies
and
at
once
handed
out
a
cheque
for
the
sum
demanded
the
money
was
so
much
to
the
attorney
that
he
was
flurried
by
his
own
success
perhaps
said
morton
i
ought
in
fairness
to
add
interest
not
at
all
by
no
means
lawyers
never
expect
that
really
morton
i
am
very
much
obliged
it
was
so
long
ago
that
i
thought
that
perhaps
you
might
think
i
do
not
doubt
that
it
all
right
yes
morton
it
is
all
right
it
is
quite
right
but
your
coming
in
this
way
is
quite
a
compliment
i
am
so
proud
to
see
the
owner
of
bragton
once
more
in
this
house
i
respect
the
family
as
i
always
did
and
as
for
the
money
i
am
only
sorry
that
it
has
been
delayed
so
long
good
morning
mr
masters
the
attorney
affairs
were
in
such
a
condition
that
an
unexpected
cheque
for
sufficed
to
exhilarate
him
it
was
as
though
the
money
had
come
down
to
him
from
the
very
skies
as
it
happened
mary
returned
from
cheltenham
on
that
same
evening
and
the
attorney
felt
that
if
she
had
brought
back
with
her
an
intention
to
be
twentyman
he
could
still
be
a
happy
and
contented
man
and
there
had
been
another
trouble
on
john
morton
mind
he
had
received
his
cousin
card
but
had
not
returned
the
visit
while
his
grandmother
had
been
at
bragton
now
he
walked
on
to
hoppet
hall
and
knocked
at
the
yes
mr
morton
was
at
home
and
then
he
was
shown
into
the
presence
of
his
cousin
whom
he
had
not
seen
since
he
was
a
boy
i
ought
to
have
come
sooner
said
the
squire
who
was
hardly
at
his
ease
i
heard
you
had
a
house
full
of
people
at
bragton
just
that
and
then
i
went
off
rather
suddenly
to
the
other
side
of
the
country
and
then
i
had
to
go
up
to
london
now
i
going
to
patagonia
patagonia
that
a
long
way
off
we
foreign
office
slaves
have
to
be
sent
a
long
way
off
but
we
heard
john
said
reginald
who
did
not
feel
it
to
be
his
duty
to
stand
on
any
ceremony
with
his
younger
cousin
we
heard
that
you
were
going
to
be
married
to
miss
trefoil
are
you
going
to
take
a
wife
out
to
patagonia
this
was
a
question
which
he
certainly
had
not
expected
i
know
how
that
may
be
he
said
frowning
we
were
told
here
in
dillsborough
that
it
was
all
settled
i
hope
i
have
asked
an
improper
question
of
course
people
will
talk
if
it
only
talk
i
beg
pardon
whatever
concerns
bragton
is
interesting
to
me
and
from
the
way
in
which
i
heard
this
i
thought
it
was
a
certainty
patagonia
well
you
do
want
an
assistant
private
secretary
i
suppose
i
should
like
to
see
patagonia
we
are
not
allowed
to
appoint
those
gentlemen
ourselves
and
i
suppose
i
should
be
too
old
to
get
in
at
the
bottom
it
seems
a
long
way
off
for
a
man
who
is
the
owner
of
bragton
it
is
a
long
way
and
what
will
you
do
with
the
old
place
there
no
one
to
live
there
if
you
were
married
you
might
perhaps
take
it
this
was
of
course
said
in
joke
as
old
morton
would
have
thought
bragton
to
be
disgraced
for
ever
even
by
such
a
proposition
you
might
let
it
who
would
take
such
a
place
for
five
years
i
suppose
old
hopkins
will
remain
and
that
it
will
become
more
and
more
desolate
every
year
i
must
let
the
old
house
tumble
down
that
all
then
the
minister
plenipotentiary
to
patagonia
took
his
departure
and
walked
back
to
bragton
thinking
of
the
publicity
of
his
engagement
all
dillsborough
had
heard
that
he
was
to
be
married
to
miss
trefoil
and
this
cousin
of
his
had
been
so
sure
of
the
fact
that
he
had
not
hesitated
to
ask
a
question
about
it
in
the
first
moment
of
their
first
interview
under
such
circumstances
it
would
be
better
for
him
to
go
to
patagonia
than
to
remain
in
england
chapter
vi
the
beginning
of
persecution
when
mary
masters
got
up
on
the
morning
after
her
arrival
she
knew
that
she
would
have
to
endure
much
on
that
day
everybody
had
smiled
on
her
the
preceding
evening
but
the
smiles
were
of
a
nature
which
declared
themselves
to
be
preparatory
to
some
coming
event
the
people
around
her
were
gracious
on
the
presumption
that
she
was
going
to
do
as
they
wished
and
would
be
quite
prepared
to
withdraw
their
smiles
should
she
prove
to
be
contumacious
mary
as
she
crept
down
in
the
morning
understood
all
this
perfectly
she
found
her
stepmother
alone
in
the
parlour
and
was
at
once
attacked
with
the
all
important
question
my
dear
i
hope
you
have
made
up
your
mind
about
mr
twentyman
there
were
to
be
two
months
mamma
that
nonsense
mary
of
course
you
must
know
what
you
mean
to
tell
him
mary
thought
that
she
did
know
but
was
not
at
the
present
moment
disposed
to
make
known
her
knowledge
and
therefore
remained
silent
you
should
remember
how
much
this
is
to
your
papa
and
me
and
should
speak
out
at
once
of
course
you
need
not
tell
twentyman
till
the
end
of
the
time
unless
you
like
it
i
thought
i
was
to
be
left
alone
for
two
months
mary
that
is
wicked
when
your
papa
has
so
many
things
to
think
of
and
so
much
to
provide
for
you
should
be
more
thoughtful
of
him
of
course
he
will
want
to
be
prepared
to
give
you
what
things
will
be
necessary
masters
had
not
as
yet
heard
of
morton
cheque
and
perhaps
would
not
hear
of
it
till
her
husband
bank
book
fell
into
her
hands
the
attorney
had
lately
found
it
necessary
to
keep
such
matters
to
himself
when
it
was
possible
as
otherwise
he
was
asked
for
explanations
which
it
was
not
always
easy
for
him
to
give
you
know
continued
masters
how
hard
your
father
finds
it
to
get
money
as
it
is
wanted
i
do
want
anything
mamma
you
must
want
things
if
you
are
to
be
married
in
march
or
april
but
i
sha
be
married
in
march
or
april
oh
mamma
pray
do
in
a
week
time
or
so
you
must
tell
larry
after
all
that
has
passed
of
course
he
wo
expect
to
have
to
wait
long
and
you
ask
him
kate
my
dear
kate
had
just
entered
the
room
go
into
the
office
and
tell
your
father
to
come
into
breakfast
in
five
minutes
you
must
know
mary
and
i
insist
on
your
telling
me
when
i
said
two
months
only
it
was
he
said
two
months
what
difference
does
it
make
my
dear
it
was
only
because
he
asked
me
to
put
it
off
i
knew
it
could
make
no
difference
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
mary
that
you
are
going
to
refuse
him
after
all
i
ca
help
it
said
mary
bursting
out
into
tears
ca
help
it
did
anybody
ever
see
such
an
idiot
since
girls
were
first
created
not
help
it
after
having
given
him
as
good
as
a
promise
you
must
help
it
you
must
be
made
to
help
it
there
was
an
injustice
in
this
which
nearly
killed
poor
mary
she
had
been
persuaded
among
them
to
put
off
her
final
decision
not
because
she
had
any
doubt
in
her
own
mind
but
at
their
request
and
now
she
was
told
that
in
granting
this
delay
she
had
given
as
good
as
a
promise
and
her
stepmother
also
had
declared
that
she
must
be
made
to
help
it
or
in
other
words
be
made
to
marry
twentyman
in
opposition
to
her
own
wishes
she
was
quite
sure
that
no
human
being
could
have
such
right
of
compulsion
over
her
her
father
would
not
attempt
it
and
it
was
after
all
to
her
father
alone
that
she
was
bound
by
duty
at
the
moment
she
could
make
no
reply
and
then
her
father
with
the
two
girls
came
in
from
the
office
the
attorney
was
still
a
little
radiant
with
his
triumph
about
the
cheque
and
was
also
pleased
with
his
own
discernment
in
the
matter
of
goarly
he
had
learned
that
morning
from
nickem
that
goarly
had
consented
to
take
an
acre
from
lord
rufford
and
was
prepared
to
act
quite
the
honourable
part
on
behalf
of
his
lordship
nickem
had
seemed
to
think
that
the
triumph
would
not
end
here
but
had
declined
to
make
any
very
definite
statements
nickem
clearly
fancied
that
he
had
been
doing
great
things
himself
and
that
he
might
be
allowed
to
have
a
little
mystery
but
the
attorney
took
great
credit
to
himself
in
that
he
had
rejected
goarly
case
and
had
been
employed
by
lord
rufford
in
lieu
of
goarly
when
he
entered
the
parlour
he
had
for
the
moment
forgotten
larry
twentyman
and
was
disposed
to
greet
his
girl
lovingly
but
he
found
her
dissolved
in
bitter
tears
mary
my
darling
what
is
it
ails
you
he
said
never
mind
about
your
darling
now
but
come
to
breakfast
she
is
giving
herself
airs
as
usual
but
mary
never
did
give
herself
airs
and
her
father
could
not
endure
the
accusation
she
would
not
be
crying
he
said
unless
she
had
something
to
cry
for
pray
do
make
a
fuss
about
things
you
do
understand
said
his
wife
mary
are
you
coming
to
the
table
if
not
you
had
better
go
i
hate
such
ways
and
i
wo
have
them
this
comes
of
ushanting
i
knew
what
it
would
be
the
place
for
girls
is
to
stay
at
home
and
mind
their
work
till
they
have
got
houses
of
their
own
to
look
after
that
what
i
intend
my
girls
to
do
there
nothing
on
earth
so
bad
for
girls
as
that
visiting
about
when
they
think
they
nothing
to
do
but
to
show
what
sort
of
ribbons
and
gloves
they
got
now
dolly
if
you
got
any
hands
will
you
cut
the
bread
for
your
father
mary
a
deal
too
fine
a
lady
to
do
anything
but
sit
there
and
rub
her
eyes
after
that
the
breakfast
was
eaten
in
silence
when
the
meal
was
over
mary
followed
her
father
into
the
office
and
said
that
she
wanted
to
speak
to
him
when
sundown
had
disappeared
she
told
her
tale
papa
she
said
i
am
so
sorry
but
i
ca
do
what
you
want
about
mr
twentyman
is
it
so
mary
do
be
angry
with
me
papa
angry
no
i
wo
be
angry
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
be
angry
with
my
girl
but
what
you
tell
me
will
make
us
all
very
unhappy
very
unhappy
indeed
what
will
you
say
to
lawrence
twentyman
what
i
said
before
papa
but
he
is
quite
certain
now
that
you
mean
to
take
him
of
course
we
were
all
certain
when
you
only
wanted
a
few
more
days
to
think
of
it
mary
felt
this
to
be
the
cruellest
thing
of
all
when
he
asked
me
i
said
i
would
pledge
you
but
i
certainly
had
no
doubt
what
is
the
matter
mary
she
could
understand
that
a
girl
might
be
asked
why
she
wanted
to
marry
a
man
and
that
in
such
a
condition
she
ought
to
be
able
to
give
a
reason
but
it
was
she
thought
very
hard
that
she
should
be
asked
why
she
did
want
to
marry
a
man
i
suppose
papa
she
said
after
a
pause
i
do
like
him
in
that
way
your
mamma
will
be
sure
to
say
that
it
is
because
you
went
to
lady
ushant
and
so
in
part
it
was
as
mary
herself
very
well
knew
though
lady
ushant
herself
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
lady
ushant
she
said
would
be
very
well
pleased
if
she
thought
that
i
liked
him
well
enough
did
you
tell
lady
ushant
yes
i
told
her
all
about
it
and
how
you
would
all
be
pleased
and
i
did
try
to
bring
myself
to
it
papa
pray
pray
do
want
to
send
me
away
from
you
you
would
be
so
near
to
us
all
at
chowton
farm
i
am
nearer
here
papa
then
she
embraced
him
and
he
in
a
manner
yielded
to
her
he
yielded
to
her
so
far
as
to
part
with
her
at
the
present
moment
with
soft
loving
words
masters
had
a
long
conversation
with
her
husband
on
the
subject
that
same
day
and
condescended
even
to
say
a
few
words
to
the
two
girls
she
had
her
own
theory
and
her
own
plan
in
the
present
emergency
according
to
her
theory
girls
should
be
indulged
in
any
vagaries
and
this
rejecting
of
a
highly
valuable
suitor
was
a
most
inexcusable
vagary
and
if
her
plan
were
followed
a
considerable
amount
of
wholesome
coercion
would
at
once
be
exercised
towards
this
refractory
young
woman
there
was
in
fact
more
than
a
fortnight
wanting
to
the
expiration
of
larry
two
months
and
masters
was
strongly
of
opinion
that
if
mary
were
put
into
a
sort
of
domestic
coventry
during
this
period
if
she
were
debarred
from
friendly
intercourse
with
the
family
and
made
to
feel
that
such
wickedness
as
hers
if
continued
would
make
her
an
outcast
then
she
would
come
round
and
accept
larry
twentyman
before
the
end
of
the
time
but
this
plan
could
not
be
carried
out
without
her
husband
were
she
to
attempt
it
mary
would
take
refuge
in
her
father
softness
of
heart
and
there
would
simply
be
two
parties
in
the
household
if
you
would
leave
her
to
me
and
not
speak
to
her
it
would
be
all
right
masters
said
to
her
husband
not
speak
to
her
not
cosset
her
and
spoil
her
for
the
next
week
or
two
just
leave
her
to
herself
and
let
her
feel
what
she
doing
think
what
chowton
farm
would
be
and
you
with
your
business
all
slipping
through
your
fingers
i
do
know
that
it
slipping
through
my
fingers
at
all
said
the
attorney
mindful
of
his
recent
successes
if
you
mean
to
say
you
do
care
about
it
i
do
care
about
it
very
much
you
know
i
do
you
ought
not
to
talk
to
me
in
that
way
then
why
wo
you
be
said
by
me
of
course
if
you
cocker
her
up
she
think
she
to
have
her
own
way
like
a
grand
lady
she
like
him
because
he
works
for
his
bread
that
what
it
is
and
because
she
been
taught
by
that
old
woman
to
read
poetry
i
never
knew
that
stuff
do
any
good
to
anybody
i
hate
them
fandangled
lines
that
are
all
cut
up
short
to
make
pretence
if
she
wants
to
read
why
ca
she
take
the
cookery
book
and
learn
something
useful
it
just
comes
to
this
if
you
want
her
to
marry
larry
twentyman
you
had
better
not
notice
her
for
the
next
fortnight
let
her
go
and
come
and
say
nothing
to
her
she
think
about
it
if
she
left
to
herself
the
attorney
did
want
his
daughter
to
marry
the
man
and
was
half
convinced
by
his
wife
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
be
cruel
and
felt
that
his
heart
would
bleed
every
hour
of
the
day
that
he
separated
himself
from
his
girl
but
still
he
thought
that
he
might
perhaps
best
in
this
way
bring
about
a
result
which
would
be
so
manifestly
for
her
advantage
it
might
be
that
the
books
of
poetry
and
the
modes
of
thought
which
his
wife
described
as
ushanting
were
of
a
nature
to
pervert
his
girl
mind
from
the
material
necessities
of
life
and
that
a
little
hardship
would
bring
her
round
to
a
more
rational
condition
with
a
very
heavy
heart
he
consented
to
do
his
part
which
was
to
consist
mainly
of
silence
any
words
which
might
be
considered
expedient
were
to
come
from
his
wife
three
or
four
days
went
on
in
this
way
which
were
days
of
absolute
misery
to
mary
she
soon
perceived
and
partly
understood
her
silence
she
knew
at
any
rate
that
for
the
present
she
was
debarred
from
his
confidence
her
mother
did
not
say
much
but
what
she
did
say
was
all
founded
on
the
theory
that
ushanting
and
softness
in
general
are
very
bad
for
young
women
even
dolly
and
kate
were
hard
to
her
each
having
some
dim
idea
that
mary
was
to
be
coerced
towards
larry
twentyman
and
her
own
good
at
the
end
of
that
time
when
mary
had
been
at
home
nearly
a
week
larry
came
as
usual
on
the
saturday
evening
she
well
knowing
his
habit
took
care
to
be
out
of
the
way
larry
with
a
pleasant
face
asked
after
her
and
expressed
a
hope
that
she
had
enjoyed
herself
at
cheltenham
a
nasty
idle
place
where
nobody
does
anything
as
i
believe
said
masters
larry
received
a
shock
from
the
tone
of
the
voice
he
had
allowed
himself
to
think
that
all
his
troubles
were
now
nearly
over
but
the
words
and
the
voice
frightened
him
he
had
told
himself
that
he
was
not
to
speak
of
his
love
again
till
the
two
months
were
over
and
like
an
honourable
man
he
was
prepared
to
wait
the
full
time
he
would
not
now
have
come
to
the
attorney
house
but
that
he
knew
the
attorney
would
wait
for
him
before
going
over
to
the
club
he
had
no
right
to
draw
deductions
till
the
time
should
be
up
but
he
could
not
help
his
own
feelings
and
was
aware
that
his
heart
sank
within
him
when
he
was
told
that
cheltenham
was
a
nasty
idle
place
abuse
of
cheltenham
at
the
present
moment
was
in
fact
abuse
of
mary
and
the
one
sin
which
mary
could
commit
was
persistence
in
her
rejection
of
his
suit
but
he
determined
to
be
a
man
as
he
walked
across
the
street
with
his
old
friend
and
said
not
a
word
about
his
love
they
tell
me
that
goarly
has
taken
his
mr
masters
of
course
he
has
taken
it
larry
the
worse
luck
for
me
if
he
had
gone
on
i
might
have
had
a
bill
against
his
lordship
as
long
as
my
arm
now
it
wo
be
worth
looking
after
i
sure
you
very
glad
mr
masters
well
yes
i
am
glad
i
do
hate
to
see
a
fellow
like
that
who
got
a
farthing
of
his
own
propped
up
from
behind
just
to
annoy
his
betters
they
say
that
bearside
got
a
lot
of
money
out
of
that
american
i
suppose
he
got
something
what
an
idiot
that
man
must
be
can
you
understand
it
mr
masters
they
now
entered
the
club
and
goarly
and
nickem
and
scrobby
were
of
course
being
discussed
is
it
true
masters
that
scrobby
is
to
be
arrested
asked
fred
botsey
at
once
upon
my
word
i
ca
say
botsey
but
if
you
tell
me
it
is
so
i
sha
cry
my
eyes
out
i
thought
you
would
have
known
a
gentleman
may
know
a
thing
botsey
said
the
landlord
and
not
exactly
choose
to
tell
it
i
did
suppose
there
was
any
secret
said
the
brewer
as
masters
made
no
further
remark
it
was
of
course
conceived
that
he
knew
all
about
it
and
he
was
therefore
treated
with
some
increased
deference
but
there
was
on
that
night
great
triumph
in
the
club
as
it
was
known
as
a
fact
that
goarly
had
withdrawn
his
claim
and
that
the
american
senator
had
paid
his
money
for
nothing
it
was
moreover
very
generally
believed
that
goarly
was
going
to
turn
evidence
against
scrobby
in
reference
to
the
poison
chapter
vii
mary
letter
the
silent
system
in
regard
to
mary
was
carried
on
in
the
house
for
a
week
during
which
her
sufferings
were
very
great
from
the
first
she
made
up
her
mind
to
oppose
her
stepmother
cruelty
by
sheer
obstinacy
she
had
been
told
that
she
must
be
made
to
marry
twentyman
and
the
injustice
of
that
threat
had
at
once
made
her
rebel
against
her
stepmother
authority
she
would
never
allow
her
stepmother
to
make
her
marry
any
one
she
put
herself
into
a
state
of
general
defiance
and
said
as
little
as
was
said
to
her
but
her
father
silence
to
her
nearly
broke
her
heart
on
one
or
two
occasions
as
opportunity
offered
itself
to
her
she
said
little
soft
words
to
him
in
privacy
then
he
would
partly
relent
would
kiss
her
and
bid
her
be
a
good
girl
and
would
quickly
hurry
away
from
her
she
could
understand
that
he
suffered
as
well
as
herself
and
she
perhaps
got
some
consolation
from
the
conviction
at
last
on
the
following
saturday
she
watched
her
opportunity
and
brought
to
him
when
he
was
alone
in
his
office
a
letter
which
she
had
written
to
larry
twentyman
papa
she
said
would
you
read
that
he
took
and
read
the
letter
which
was
as
follows
my
dear
twentyman
something
was
said
about
two
months
which
are
now
very
nearly
over
i
think
i
ought
to
save
you
from
the
trouble
of
coming
to
me
again
by
telling
you
in
a
letter
that
it
can
not
be
as
you
would
have
it
i
have
thought
of
it
a
great
deal
and
have
of
course
been
anxious
to
do
as
my
friends
wish
and
i
am
very
grateful
to
you
and
know
how
good
and
how
kind
you
are
and
i
would
do
anything
for
you
except
this
but
it
never
can
be
i
should
not
write
like
this
unless
i
were
quite
certain
i
hope
you
wo
be
angry
with
me
and
think
that
i
should
have
spared
you
the
trouble
of
doubting
so
long
i
know
now
that
i
ought
not
to
have
doubted
at
all
but
i
was
so
anxious
not
to
seem
to
be
obstinate
that
i
became
foolish
about
it
when
you
asked
me
what
i
say
now
is
quite
certain
dear
twentyman
i
shall
always
think
of
you
with
esteem
and
regard
because
i
know
how
good
you
are
and
i
hope
you
will
come
to
like
somebody
a
great
deal
better
than
me
who
will
always
love
you
with
her
whole
heart
yours
very
truly
mary
masters
i
shall
show
this
letter
to
papa
masters
read
it
as
she
stood
by
him
and
then
read
it
again
very
slowly
rubbing
one
hand
over
the
other
as
he
did
so
he
was
thinking
what
he
should
do
or
rather
what
he
should
say
the
idea
of
stopping
the
letter
never
occurred
to
him
if
she
chose
to
refuse
the
man
of
course
she
must
do
so
and
perhaps
if
she
did
refuse
him
there
was
no
way
better
than
this
must
it
be
so
mary
he
said
at
last
yes
papa
but
why
because
i
do
not
love
him
as
i
should
have
to
love
any
man
that
i
wanted
to
marry
i
have
tried
it
because
you
wished
it
but
i
can
not
do
it
what
will
mamma
say
i
am
thinking
more
papa
of
you
she
said
putting
her
arm
over
his
shoulder
you
have
always
been
so
good
to
me
and
so
kind
here
his
heart
misgave
him
for
he
felt
that
during
the
last
week
he
had
not
been
kind
to
her
but
you
would
not
wish
me
to
give
myself
to
a
man
and
then
not
to
care
for
him
no
my
dear
i
could
do
it
i
should
fall
down
dead
first
i
have
thought
so
much
about
it
for
your
sake
and
have
tried
it
with
myself
i
could
do
it
is
there
anybody
else
mary
as
he
asked
the
question
he
held
her
hand
beneath
his
own
on
the
desk
but
he
did
not
dare
to
look
into
her
face
he
had
been
told
by
his
wife
that
there
was
somebody
else
that
the
girl
mind
was
running
upon
surtees
because
surtees
was
a
gentleman
he
was
thinking
of
surtees
and
certainly
not
of
reginald
morton
to
her
the
moment
was
very
solemn
and
when
the
question
was
asked
she
felt
that
she
could
not
tell
her
father
a
falsehood
she
had
gradually
grown
bold
enough
to
assure
herself
that
her
heart
was
occupied
with
that
man
who
had
travelled
with
her
to
cheltenham
and
she
felt
that
that
feeling
alone
must
keep
her
apart
from
any
other
love
and
yet
as
she
had
no
hope
as
she
had
assured
herself
that
her
love
was
a
burden
to
be
borne
and
could
never
become
a
source
of
enjoyment
why
should
her
secret
be
wrested
from
her
what
good
would
such
a
violation
do
but
she
could
not
tell
the
falsehood
and
therefore
she
held
her
tongue
gradually
he
looked
up
into
her
face
still
keeping
her
hand
pressed
on
the
desk
under
his
it
was
his
left
hand
that
so
guarded
her
while
she
stood
by
his
right
shoulder
then
he
gently
wound
his
right
arm
round
her
waist
and
pressed
her
to
him
mary
he
said
if
it
is
so
had
you
not
better
tell
me
but
she
was
sure
that
she
had
better
not
mention
that
name
even
to
him
it
was
impossible
that
she
should
mention
it
she
would
have
outraged
to
herself
her
own
maiden
modesty
by
doing
so
is
it
he
asked
very
softly
is
it
mr
surtees
oh
no
she
said
quickly
almost
escaping
from
the
grasp
of
his
arm
in
her
start
then
he
was
absolutely
at
a
loss
beyond
surtees
or
larry
twentyman
he
did
not
know
what
possible
lover
dillsborough
could
have
afforded
and
yet
the
very
rapidity
of
her
answer
when
the
name
had
been
mentioned
had
convinced
him
that
there
was
some
other
person
had
increased
the
strength
of
that
conviction
which
her
silence
had
produced
have
you
nothing
that
you
can
tell
me
mary
no
papa
then
he
gave
her
back
the
letter
and
she
left
the
room
without
another
word
of
course
his
sanction
to
the
letter
had
now
been
given
and
it
was
addressed
to
chowton
farm
and
posted
before
half
an
hour
was
over
she
saw
him
again
in
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
and
asked
him
to
tell
her
stepmother
what
she
had
done
mamma
ought
to
know
she
said
but
you
have
sent
it
yes
papa
it
is
in
the
post
then
it
occurred
to
him
that
his
wife
would
tell
him
that
he
should
have
prevented
the
sending
of
the
letter
that
he
should
have
destroyed
it
and
altogether
taken
the
matter
with
a
high
hand
you
ca
tell
her
yourself
he
asked
i
would
rather
you
did
mamma
has
been
so
hard
to
me
since
i
came
home
he
did
tell
his
wife
and
she
overwhelmed
him
by
the
violence
of
her
reproaches
he
could
never
have
been
in
earnest
or
he
would
not
have
allowed
such
a
letter
as
that
to
pass
through
his
hands
he
must
be
afraid
of
his
own
child
he
did
not
know
his
own
duty
he
had
been
deceiving
her
his
wife
from
first
to
last
then
she
threw
herself
into
a
torrent
of
tears
declaring
that
she
had
been
betrayed
there
had
been
a
conspiracy
between
them
and
now
everything
might
go
to
the
dogs
and
she
would
not
lift
up
her
hands
again
to
save
them
but
before
the
evening
came
round
she
was
again
on
the
alert
and
again
resolved
that
she
would
not
even
yet
give
way
what
was
there
in
a
letter
more
than
in
a
spoken
word
she
would
tell
larry
to
disregard
the
letter
but
first
she
made
a
futile
attempt
to
clutch
the
letter
from
the
guardianship
of
the
post
office
and
she
went
to
the
postmaster
assuring
him
that
there
had
been
a
mistake
in
the
family
that
a
wrong
letter
had
been
put
into
a
wrong
envelope
and
begging
that
the
letter
addressed
to
twentyman
might
be
given
back
to
her
the
postmaster
half
vacillating
in
his
desire
to
oblige
a
neighbour
produced
the
letter
and
masters
put
out
her
hand
to
grasp
it
but
the
servant
of
the
public
who
had
been
thoroughly
grounded
in
his
duties
by
one
of
those
trusty
guardians
of
our
correspondence
who
inspect
and
survey
our
provincial
post
offices
remembered
himself
at
the
last
moment
and
expressing
the
violence
of
his
regret
replaced
the
letter
in
the
box
masters
in
her
anger
and
grief
condescended
to
say
very
hard
things
to
her
neighbour
but
the
man
remembered
his
duty
and
was
firm
on
that
evening
larry
twentyman
did
not
attend
the
dillsborough
club
having
in
the
course
of
the
week
notified
to
the
attorney
that
he
should
be
a
defaulter
masters
himself
went
over
earlier
than
usual
his
own
house
having
become
very
uncomfortable
to
him
masters
for
an
hour
sat
expecting
that
larry
would
come
and
when
the
evening
passed
away
without
his
appearance
she
was
convinced
that
the
unusual
absence
was
a
part
of
the
conspiracy
against
her
larry
did
not
get
his
letter
till
the
monday
morning
on
the
last
thursday
and
saturday
he
had
consoled
himself
for
his
doubts
with
the
and
was
minded
to
do
so
on
the
monday
also
he
had
not
gone
to
the
club
on
saturday
and
had
moped
about
chowton
all
the
sunday
in
a
feverish
state
because
of
his
doubts
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
two
months
would
never
be
over
on
the
monday
he
was
out
early
on
the
farm
and
then
came
down
in
his
boots
and
breeches
and
had
his
red
coat
ready
at
the
fire
while
he
sat
at
breakfast
the
meet
was
fifteen
miles
off
and
he
had
sent
on
his
hunter
intending
to
travel
thither
in
his
dog
cart
just
as
he
was
cutting
himself
a
slice
of
beef
the
postman
came
and
of
course
he
read
his
letter
he
read
it
with
the
carving
knife
in
his
hand
and
then
he
stood
gazing
at
his
mother
what
is
it
larry
she
asked
is
anything
wrong
wrong
well
i
do
know
he
said
i
do
know
what
you
call
wrong
i
sha
hunt
that
all
then
he
threw
aside
the
knife
and
pushed
away
his
plate
and
marched
out
of
the
room
with
the
open
letter
in
his
hand
twentyman
knew
very
well
of
his
love
as
indeed
did
nearly
all
dillsborough
but
she
had
heard
nothing
of
the
two
months
and
did
not
connect
the
letter
with
mary
masters
surely
he
must
have
lost
a
large
sum
of
money
that
was
her
idea
till
she
saw
him
again
late
in
the
afternoon
he
never
went
near
the
hounds
that
day
or
near
his
business
he
was
not
then
man
enough
for
either
but
he
walked
about
the
fields
keeping
out
of
sight
of
everybody
it
was
all
over
now
it
must
be
all
over
when
she
wrote
to
him
a
letter
like
that
why
had
she
tempted
him
to
thoughts
of
happiness
and
success
by
that
promise
of
two
months
grace
he
supposed
that
he
was
not
good
enough
or
that
she
thought
he
was
not
good
enough
then
he
remembered
his
acres
and
his
material
comforts
and
tried
to
console
himself
by
reflecting
that
mary
masters
might
very
well
do
worse
in
the
world
but
there
was
no
consolation
in
it
he
had
tried
his
best
because
he
had
really
loved
the
girl
he
had
failed
and
all
the
world
all
his
world
would
know
that
he
had
failed
there
was
not
a
man
in
the
club
hardly
a
man
in
the
hunt
who
was
not
aware
that
he
had
offered
to
mary
masters
during
the
last
two
months
he
had
not
been
so
reticent
as
was
prudent
and
had
almost
boasted
to
fred
botsey
of
success
and
then
how
was
he
to
live
at
chowton
farm
without
mary
masters
as
his
wife
as
he
returned
home
he
almost
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
not
continue
to
live
at
chowton
farm
he
came
back
through
dillsborough
wood
and
there
prowling
about
he
met
goarly
well
twentyman
said
the
man
i
am
making
it
all
straight
now
with
his
lordship
i
do
care
what
you
doing
said
larry
in
his
misery
you
are
an
infernal
blackguard
and
that
the
best
of
you
chapter
viii
chowton
farm
for
sale
john
morton
had
returned
to
town
soon
after
his
walk
into
dillsborough
and
had
there
learned
from
different
sources
that
both
arabella
trefoil
and
lord
rufford
had
gone
or
were
going
to
mistletoe
he
had
seen
lord
augustus
who
though
he
could
tell
him
nothing
else
about
his
daughter
had
not
been
slow
to
inform
him
that
she
was
going
to
the
house
of
her
noble
uncle
when
morton
had
spoken
to
him
very
seriously
about
the
engagement
he
declared
that
he
knew
nothing
about
it
except
that
he
had
given
his
consent
if
the
settlements
were
all
right
lady
augustus
managed
all
that
morton
had
then
said
that
under
those
circumstances
he
feared
he
must
regard
the
honour
which
he
had
hoped
to
enjoy
as
being
beyond
his
reach
lord
augustus
had
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
had
gone
back
to
his
whist
this
interview
having
taken
place
in
the
strangers
room
of
his
club
that
lord
rufford
was
also
going
to
mistletoe
he
heard
from
young
glossop
at
the
foreign
office
it
was
quite
possible
that
glossop
had
been
instructed
to
make
this
known
to
morton
by
his
sister
lady
penwether
then
morton
declared
that
the
thing
was
over
and
that
he
would
trouble
himself
no
more
about
it
but
this
resolution
did
not
make
him
at
all
contented
and
in
his
misery
he
went
again
down
to
his
solitude
at
bragton
and
now
when
he
might
fairly
consider
himself
to
be
free
and
when
he
should
surely
have
congratulated
himself
on
a
most
lucky
escape
from
the
great
danger
into
which
he
had
fallen
his
love
and
admiration
for
the
girl
returned
to
him
in
a
most
wonderful
manner
he
thought
of
her
beauty
and
her
grace
and
the
manner
in
which
she
would
sit
at
the
head
of
his
table
when
the
time
should
come
for
him
to
be
promoted
to
some
great
capital
to
him
she
had
fascinations
which
the
reader
who
perhaps
knows
her
better
than
he
ever
did
will
not
share
he
could
forgive
the
coldness
of
her
conduct
to
himself
he
himself
not
being
by
nature
demonstrative
or
impassioned
if
only
she
were
not
more
kind
to
any
rival
it
was
the
fact
that
she
should
be
visiting
at
the
same
house
with
lord
rufford
after
what
he
had
seen
at
rufford
hall
which
had
angered
him
but
now
in
his
solitude
he
thought
that
he
might
have
been
wrong
at
rufford
hall
if
it
were
the
case
that
the
girl
feared
that
her
marriage
might
be
prevented
by
the
operations
of
lawyers
and
family
friends
of
course
she
would
be
right
not
to
throw
herself
into
his
arms
even
metaphorically
he
was
a
cold
just
man
who
when
he
had
loved
could
not
easily
get
rid
of
his
love
and
now
he
would
ask
himself
whether
he
was
not
hard
upon
the
girl
it
was
natural
that
she
should
be
at
mistletoe
but
then
why
should
lord
rufford
be
there
with
her
his
prospects
at
patagonia
did
not
console
him
much
no
doubt
it
was
a
handsome
mission
for
a
man
of
his
age
and
there
were
sundry
patagonian
questions
of
importance
at
the
present
moment
which
would
give
him
a
certain
weight
patagonia
was
repudiating
a
loan
and
it
was
hoped
that
he
might
induce
a
better
feeling
in
the
patagonian
parliament
there
was
the
patagonian
railway
for
joining
the
straits
to
the
cape
the
details
of
which
he
was
now
studying
with
great
diligence
and
then
there
was
the
vital
question
of
boundary
between
patagonia
and
the
argentine
republic
by
settling
which
should
he
be
happy
enough
to
succeed
in
doing
so
he
would
prevent
the
horrors
of
warfare
he
endeavoured
to
fix
his
mind
with
satisfaction
on
these
great
objects
as
he
pored
over
the
reports
and
papers
which
had
been
heaped
upon
him
since
he
had
accepted
the
mission
but
there
was
present
to
him
always
a
feeling
that
the
men
at
the
foreign
office
had
been
glad
to
get
any
respectable
diplomate
to
go
to
patagonia
and
that
his
brethren
in
the
profession
had
marvelled
at
his
acceptance
of
such
a
mission
one
never
likes
to
be
thanked
over
much
for
doing
anything
it
creates
a
feeling
that
one
has
given
more
than
was
expedient
he
knew
that
he
must
now
go
to
patagonia
but
he
repented
the
alacrity
with
which
he
had
acceded
to
the
proposition
whether
he
did
marry
arabella
trefoil
or
whether
he
did
not
there
was
no
adequate
reason
for
such
a
banishment
and
yet
he
could
not
now
escape
it
it
was
on
a
monday
morning
that
larry
twentyman
had
found
himself
unable
to
go
hunting
on
the
tuesday
he
gave
his
workmen
about
the
farm
such
a
routing
as
they
had
not
received
for
many
a
month
there
had
not
been
a
dungheap
or
a
cowshed
which
he
had
not
visited
nor
a
fence
about
the
place
with
which
he
had
not
found
fault
he
was
at
it
all
day
trying
thus
to
console
himself
but
in
vain
and
when
his
mother
in
the
evening
said
some
word
of
her
misery
in
regard
to
the
turkeys
he
had
told
her
that
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
goarly
might
poison
every
fox
in
the
county
then
the
poor
woman
knew
that
matters
were
going
badly
with
her
son
on
the
wednesday
when
the
hounds
met
within
two
miles
of
chowton
he
again
stayed
at
home
but
in
the
afternoon
he
rode
into
dillsborough
and
contrived
to
see
the
attorney
without
being
seen
by
any
of
the
ladies
of
the
family
the
interview
did
not
seem
to
do
him
any
good
on
the
thursday
morning
he
walked
across
to
bragton
and
with
a
firm
voice
asked
to
see
the
squire
morton
who
was
deep
in
the
boundary
question
put
aside
his
papers
and
welcomed
his
neighbour
now
it
must
be
explained
that
when
in
former
years
his
son
debts
had
accumulated
on
old
reginald
morton
so
that
he
had
been
obliged
to
part
with
some
portion
of
his
unentailed
property
he
had
sold
that
which
lay
in
the
parish
of
john
dillsborough
the
lands
in
bragton
and
mallingham
he
could
not
sell
but
chowton
farm
which
was
in
john
had
been
bought
by
larry
grandfather
for
a
time
there
had
been
some
bitterness
of
feeling
but
the
twentymans
had
been
respectable
people
most
anxious
to
be
good
neighbours
and
had
gradually
made
themselves
liked
by
the
owner
of
bragton
the
present
squire
had
of
course
known
nothing
of
chowton
as
a
part
of
the
morton
property
and
had
no
more
desire
for
it
than
for
any
of
lord
rufford
acres
which
were
contiguous
to
his
own
he
shook
hands
cordially
with
his
neighbour
as
though
this
visit
were
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
and
asked
some
questions
about
goarly
and
the
hunt
i
believe
that
all
come
square
morton
i
not
interesting
myself
much
about
it
now
larry
was
not
dressed
like
himself
he
had
on
a
dark
brown
coat
and
dark
pantaloons
and
a
hat
he
was
conspicuous
generally
for
garments
and
for
a
billycock
hat
he
was
very
unlike
his
usual
self
on
the
present
occasion
i
thought
you
were
just
the
man
who
did
interest
himself
about
those
things
well
yes
once
it
was
so
morton
what
i
got
to
say
now
morton
is
this
chowton
farm
is
in
the
market
but
i
would
say
a
word
to
any
one
about
it
till
you
had
had
the
offer
you
going
to
sell
chowton
yes
morton
i
am
from
all
i
have
heard
of
you
i
would
have
believed
it
if
anybody
else
had
told
me
it
a
fact
morton
there
are
three
hundred
and
twenty
acres
i
put
the
rental
at
an
acre
you
know
what
you
get
morton
for
the
land
that
lies
next
to
it
and
i
think
purchase
is
more
than
it
worth
those
are
my
ideas
as
to
price
morton
there
is
a
halfpenny
owing
on
it
not
in
the
way
of
mortgage
i
dare
say
it
worth
that
up
at
auction
i
might
get
a
turn
more
morton
but
those
are
my
ideas
at
present
john
morton
who
was
a
man
of
business
went
to
work
at
once
with
his
pencil
and
in
two
minutes
had
made
out
a
total
i
do
know
that
i
could
put
my
hand
on
even
if
i
were
minded
to
make
the
purchase
that
need
stand
in
the
way
sir
any
part
you
please
could
lie
on
mortgage
at
per
cent
larry
in
the
midst
of
his
distress
had
certain
clear
ideas
about
business
this
is
a
very
serious
proposition
mr
twentyman
yes
indeed
sir
have
you
any
other
views
in
life
i
ca
say
as
i
have
any
fixed
i
sha
be
idle
morton
i
never
was
idle
i
was
thinking
perhaps
of
new
zealand
a
very
fine
colony
for
a
young
man
no
doubt
but
seeing
how
well
you
are
established
here
i
ca
stay
here
morton
i
made
up
my
mind
about
that
there
are
things
which
a
man
ca
bear
not
and
live
quiet
as
for
hunting
i
do
care
about
it
any
more
than
nothing
i
am
sorry
that
anything
should
have
made
you
so
unhappy
well
i
am
unhappy
that
about
the
truth
of
it
and
i
always
shall
be
unhappy
here
there
nothing
else
for
it
but
going
away
if
it
anything
sudden
twentyman
allow
me
to
say
that
you
ought
not
to
sell
your
property
without
grave
consideration
i
have
considered
it
very
grave
mr
morton
ah
but
i
mean
long
consideration
take
a
year
to
think
of
it
you
ca
buy
such
a
place
back
in
a
year
i
do
know
you
well
enough
to
be
justified
in
inquiring
into
the
circumstances
of
your
trouble
but
unless
it
be
something
which
makes
it
altogether
inexpedient
or
almost
impossible
that
you
should
remain
in
the
neighbourhood
you
should
not
sell
chowton
i
tell
you
morton
said
larry
almost
weeping
poor
larry
whether
in
his
triumph
or
his
sorrow
had
no
gift
of
reticence
and
now
told
his
neighbour
the
whole
story
of
his
love
he
was
certain
it
had
become
quite
hopeless
he
was
sure
that
she
would
never
have
written
him
a
letter
if
there
had
been
any
smallest
chance
left
according
to
his
ideas
a
girl
might
say
no
times
and
yet
not
mean
much
but
when
she
had
committed
herself
to
a
letter
she
could
not
go
back
from
it
is
there
anybody
else
asked
morton
not
as
i
know
i
never
saw
anything
like
like
lightness
with
her
with
any
man
they
said
something
about
the
curate
but
i
believe
a
word
of
it
and
the
family
approve
of
it
every
one
of
them
father
and
stepmother
and
sisters
and
all
my
own
mother
too
there
ai
a
against
it
i
do
want
any
one
to
give
me
sixpence
in
money
and
she
should
live
just
like
a
lady
i
can
keep
a
servant
for
her
to
cook
and
do
every
mortal
thing
but
it
ai
nothing
of
all
that
mr
morton
what
is
it
then
the
poor
man
paused
before
he
made
his
answer
but
when
he
did
he
made
it
plain
enough
i
ai
good
enough
for
her
nor
more
i
ai
morton
she
was
brought
up
in
this
house
morton
by
your
own
so
i
have
heard
mr
twentyman
and
there
more
of
bragton
than
there
is
of
dillsborough
about
her
that
just
where
it
is
i
know
what
i
am
and
i
know
what
she
is
and
i
ai
good
enough
for
her
it
should
be
somebody
that
can
talk
books
to
her
i
can
tell
her
how
to
plant
a
field
of
wheat
or
how
to
run
a
foal
but
i
ca
sit
and
read
poetry
nor
yet
be
read
to
there
plenty
of
would
sell
themselves
because
the
all
there
and
the
house
and
the
things
in
it
what
makes
me
mad
is
that
i
should
love
her
all
the
better
because
she
wo
my
belief
is
morton
they
as
poor
as
job
that
makes
no
difference
to
me
because
i
do
want
it
but
it
makes
no
difference
to
her
neither
she
right
morton
i
not
good
enough
and
so
just
cut
it
as
far
as
dillsborough
is
concerned
you
think
of
what
i
said
of
taking
the
land
morton
said
much
more
to
him
walking
with
him
to
the
gate
of
chowton
farm
he
assured
him
that
the
young
lady
might
yet
be
won
he
had
only
morton
said
to
plead
his
case
to
her
as
well
as
he
had
pleaded
up
at
bragton
and
he
thought
that
she
would
be
won
i
could
speak
out
free
to
her
not
if
it
was
to
save
the
whole
place
said
the
unfortunate
lover
but
morton
still
continued
his
advice
as
to
leaving
chowton
because
a
young
lady
refused
him
that
would
be
unmanly
there
is
a
bit
of
a
man
left
about
me
said
larry
weeping
morton
nevertheless
went
on
time
would
cure
these
wounds
but
no
time
would
give
him
back
chowton
should
he
once
part
with
it
if
he
must
leave
the
place
for
a
time
let
him
put
a
caretaker
on
the
farm
even
though
by
doing
so
the
loss
might
be
great
he
should
do
anything
rather
than
surrender
his
house
as
to
buying
the
land
himself
morton
would
not
talk
about
it
in
the
present
circumstances
then
they
parted
at
chowton
gate
with
many
expressions
of
friendship
on
each
side
john
morton
as
he
returned
home
could
not
help
thinking
that
the
young
farmer
condition
was
after
all
better
than
his
own
there
was
an
honesty
about
both
the
persons
concerned
of
which
at
any
rate
they
might
be
proud
there
was
real
love
and
though
that
love
was
not
at
present
happy
it
was
of
a
nature
to
inspire
perfect
respect
but
in
his
own
case
he
was
sure
of
nothing
chapter
ix
mistletoe
when
arabella
trefoil
started
from
london
for
mistletoe
with
no
companion
but
her
own
maid
she
had
given
more
serious
consideration
to
her
visit
than
she
had
probably
ever
paid
to
any
matter
up
to
that
time
she
had
often
been
much
in
earnest
but
never
so
much
in
earnest
as
now
those
other
men
had
perhaps
been
worthy
worthy
as
far
as
her
ideas
went
of
worth
but
none
of
them
so
worthy
as
this
man
everything
was
there
if
she
could
only
get
it
money
rank
fashion
and
an
appetite
for
pleasure
and
he
was
handsome
too
and
though
these
qualities
told
less
with
her
than
the
others
and
now
she
was
to
meet
him
in
the
house
of
her
great
relations
in
a
position
in
which
her
rank
and
her
fashion
would
seem
to
be
equal
to
his
own
and
she
would
meet
him
with
the
remembrance
fresh
in
his
mind
as
in
her
own
of
those
passages
of
love
at
rufford
it
would
be
impossible
that
he
should
even
seem
to
forget
them
the
most
that
she
could
expect
would
be
four
or
five
days
of
his
company
and
she
knew
that
she
must
be
upon
her
mettle
she
must
do
more
now
than
she
had
ever
attempted
before
she
must
scruple
at
nothing
that
might
bind
him
she
would
be
in
the
house
of
her
uncle
and
that
uncle
a
duke
and
she
thought
that
those
facts
might
help
to
quell
him
and
she
would
be
there
without
her
mother
who
was
so
often
a
heavy
incubus
on
her
shoulders
she
thought
of
it
all
and
made
her
plans
carefully
and
even
painfully
she
would
be
at
any
rate
two
days
in
the
house
before
his
arrival
during
that
time
she
would
curry
favour
with
her
uncle
by
all
her
arts
and
would
if
possible
reconcile
herself
to
her
aunt
she
thought
once
of
taking
her
aunt
into
her
full
confidence
and
balanced
the
matter
much
in
her
mind
the
duchess
she
knew
was
afraid
of
her
or
rather
afraid
of
the
relationship
and
would
of
course
be
pleased
to
have
all
fears
set
at
rest
by
such
an
alliance
but
her
aunt
was
a
woman
who
had
never
suffered
hardships
whose
own
marriage
had
been
easily
arranged
and
whose
two
daughters
had
been
pleasantly
married
before
they
were
twenty
years
old
she
had
had
no
experience
of
feminine
difficulties
and
would
have
no
mercy
for
such
labours
as
those
to
which
her
less
fortunate
niece
was
driven
it
would
have
been
a
great
thing
to
have
the
cordial
of
her
aunt
but
she
could
not
venture
to
ask
for
it
she
had
stretched
her
means
and
her
credit
to
the
utmost
in
regard
to
her
wardrobe
and
was
aware
that
she
had
never
been
so
well
equipped
since
those
early
days
of
her
career
in
which
her
father
and
mother
had
thought
that
her
beauty
assisted
by
a
generous
expenditure
would
serve
to
dispose
of
her
without
delay
a
generous
expenditure
may
be
incurred
once
even
by
poor
people
but
can
not
possibly
be
maintained
over
a
dozen
years
now
she
had
taken
the
matter
into
her
own
hands
and
had
done
that
which
would
be
ruinous
if
not
successful
she
was
venturing
her
all
upon
the
die
with
the
prospect
of
drowning
herself
on
the
way
out
to
patagonia
should
the
chances
of
the
game
go
against
her
she
forgot
nothing
she
could
hardly
hope
for
more
than
one
day
hunting
and
yet
that
had
been
provided
for
as
though
she
were
going
to
ride
with
the
hounds
through
all
the
remainder
of
the
season
when
she
reached
mistletoe
there
were
people
going
and
coming
every
day
so
that
an
arrival
was
no
event
she
was
kissed
by
her
uncle
and
welcomed
with
characteristic
coldness
by
her
aunt
then
allowed
to
settle
in
among
the
other
guests
as
though
she
had
been
there
all
the
winter
everybody
knew
that
she
was
a
trefoil
and
her
presence
therefore
raised
no
question
the
duchess
of
omnium
was
among
the
guests
the
duchess
knew
all
about
her
and
vouchsafed
to
her
the
smallest
possible
recognition
lady
chiltern
had
met
her
before
and
as
lady
chiltern
was
always
generous
she
was
gracious
to
arabella
she
was
sorry
to
see
lady
drummond
because
she
connected
lady
drummond
with
the
foreign
office
and
feared
that
the
conversation
might
be
led
to
patagonia
and
its
new
minister
she
contrived
to
squeeze
her
uncle
hand
and
to
utter
a
word
of
warm
thanks
which
his
grace
did
not
perfectly
understand
the
girl
was
his
niece
and
the
duke
had
an
idea
that
he
should
be
kind
to
the
family
of
which
he
was
the
head
his
brother
wife
had
become
objectionable
to
him
but
as
to
the
girl
if
she
wanted
a
home
for
a
week
or
two
he
thought
it
to
be
his
duty
to
give
it
to
her
mistletoe
is
an
enormous
house
with
a
frontage
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
mile
long
combining
as
it
does
all
the
offices
coach
houses
and
stables
there
is
nothing
in
england
more
ugly
or
perhaps
more
comfortable
it
stands
in
a
huge
park
which
as
it
is
quite
flat
never
shows
its
size
and
is
altogether
unattractive
the
duke
himself
was
a
hospitable
easy
man
who
was
very
fond
of
his
dinner
and
performed
his
duties
well
but
could
never
be
touched
by
any
sentiment
he
always
spent
six
months
in
the
country
in
which
he
acted
as
landlord
to
a
great
crowd
of
shooting
hunting
and
flirting
visitors
and
six
in
london
in
which
he
gave
dinners
and
dined
out
and
regularly
took
his
place
in
the
house
of
lords
without
ever
opening
his
mouth
he
was
a
comely
man
of
sixty
with
a
large
body
and
a
wonderful
appetite
by
many
who
understood
the
subject
he
was
supposed
to
be
the
best
amateur
judge
of
wine
in
england
his
son
lord
mistletoe
was
member
for
the
county
and
as
the
duke
had
no
younger
sons
he
was
supposed
to
be
happy
at
all
points
lord
mistletoe
who
had
a
large
family
of
his
own
lived
twenty
miles
off
so
that
the
father
and
son
could
meet
pleasantly
without
fear
of
quarrelling
during
the
first
evening
arabella
did
contrive
to
make
herself
very
agreeable
she
was
much
quieter
than
had
been
her
wont
when
at
mistletoe
before
and
though
there
were
present
two
or
three
very
well
circumstanced
young
men
she
took
but
little
notice
of
them
she
went
out
to
dinner
with
sir
jeffrey
bunker
and
made
herself
agreeable
to
that
old
gentleman
in
a
remarkable
manner
after
dinner
something
having
been
said
of
the
respectable
old
game
called
cradle
she
played
it
to
perfection
with
sir
jeffrey
till
her
aunt
thought
that
she
must
have
been
unaware
that
sir
jeffrey
had
a
wife
and
family
she
was
all
smiles
and
all
pleasantness
and
seemed
to
want
no
other
happiness
than
what
the
present
moment
gave
her
nor
did
she
once
mention
lord
rufford
name
on
the
next
morning
after
breakfast
her
aunt
sent
for
her
to
come
such
a
thing
had
never
happened
to
her
before
she
could
not
recollect
that
on
any
of
those
annual
visits
which
she
had
made
to
mistletoe
for
more
years
than
she
now
liked
to
think
of
she
had
ever
had
five
minutes
conversation
alone
with
her
aunt
it
had
always
seemed
that
she
was
to
be
allowed
to
come
and
go
by
reason
of
her
relationship
but
that
she
was
to
receive
no
special
mark
of
confidence
or
affection
the
message
was
whispered
into
her
ear
by
her
aunt
own
woman
as
she
was
listening
with
great
attention
to
lady
drummond
troubles
in
regard
to
her
nursery
arrangements
she
nodded
her
head
heard
a
few
more
words
from
lady
drummond
and
then
with
a
pretty
apology
and
a
statement
made
so
that
all
should
hear
her
that
her
aunt
wanted
her
followed
the
maid
my
dear
said
her
aunt
when
the
door
was
closed
i
want
to
ask
you
whether
you
would
like
me
to
ask
morton
to
come
here
while
you
are
with
us
a
thunderbolt
at
her
feet
could
hardly
have
surprised
or
annoyed
her
more
if
there
was
one
thing
that
she
wanted
less
than
another
it
was
the
presence
of
the
paragon
at
mistletoe
it
would
utterly
subvert
everything
and
rob
her
of
every
chance
with
a
great
effort
she
restrained
all
emotion
and
simply
shook
her
head
she
did
it
very
well
and
betrayed
nothing
i
ask
said
the
duchess
because
i
have
been
very
glad
to
hear
that
you
are
engaged
to
marry
him
lord
drummond
tells
me
that
he
is
a
most
respectable
young
man
morton
will
be
so
much
obliged
to
lord
drummond
and
i
thought
that
if
it
were
so
you
would
be
glad
that
he
should
meet
you
here
i
could
manage
it
very
well
as
the
drummonds
are
here
and
lord
drummond
would
be
glad
to
meet
him
they
had
not
been
above
a
minute
or
two
together
and
arabella
had
been
called
upon
to
expend
her
energy
in
suppressing
any
expression
of
her
horror
but
still
by
the
time
that
she
was
called
on
to
speak
she
had
fabricated
her
story
thanks
aunt
it
is
so
good
of
you
and
if
everything
was
going
straight
there
would
be
nothing
of
course
that
i
should
like
so
much
you
are
engaged
to
him
well
i
was
going
to
tell
you
i
dare
say
it
is
not
his
fault
but
papa
and
mamma
and
the
lawyers
think
that
he
is
not
behaving
well
about
money
settlements
and
all
that
i
suppose
it
will
all
come
right
but
in
the
meantime
perhaps
i
had
better
not
meet
him
but
you
were
engaged
to
him
this
had
to
be
answered
without
a
moment
pause
yes
said
arabella
i
was
engaged
to
him
and
he
is
going
out
as
minister
to
patagonia
almost
immediately
he
is
going
i
know
i
suppose
you
will
go
with
him
this
was
very
hard
she
could
not
say
that
she
certainly
was
not
going
with
him
and
yet
she
had
to
remember
that
her
coming
campaign
with
lord
rufford
must
be
carried
on
in
part
beneath
her
aunt
eyes
when
she
had
come
to
mistletoe
she
had
fondly
hoped
that
none
of
the
family
there
would
know
anything
about
morton
and
now
she
was
called
upon
to
answer
these
horrid
questions
without
a
notice
i
do
think
i
shall
go
with
him
aunt
though
i
am
unable
to
say
anything
certain
just
at
present
if
he
behaves
badly
of
course
the
engagement
must
be
off
i
hope
not
you
should
think
of
it
very
seriously
as
for
money
you
know
you
have
none
of
your
own
and
i
am
told
that
he
has
a
very
nice
property
in
rufford
there
is
a
neighbour
of
his
coming
here
and
perhaps
he
knows
him
who
is
the
neighbour
aunt
asked
arabella
innocently
lord
rufford
he
is
coming
to
shoot
i
will
ask
him
about
the
property
pray
do
mention
my
name
aunt
it
would
be
so
unpleasant
if
nothing
were
to
come
of
it
i
know
lord
rufford
very
well
know
lord
rufford
very
well
as
one
does
know
men
that
one
meets
about
i
thought
it
might
settle
everything
if
we
had
morton
here
i
could
meet
him
aunt
i
could
indeed
mamma
does
think
that
he
is
behaving
well
to
the
duchess
condemnation
from
lady
augustus
almost
amounted
to
praise
she
felt
sure
that
morton
was
a
worthy
man
who
would
not
probably
behave
badly
and
though
she
could
not
unravel
the
mystery
and
certainly
had
no
suspicion
in
regard
to
lord
rufford
she
was
sure
that
there
was
something
wrong
but
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
at
present
after
what
arabella
had
told
her
morton
could
not
be
asked
there
to
meet
her
niece
but
all
the
slight
feeling
of
kindness
to
the
girl
which
had
been
created
by
the
tidings
of
so
respectable
an
engagement
were
at
once
obliterated
from
the
duchess
bosom
arabella
with
many
expressions
of
thanks
and
a
countenance
left
the
room
cursing
the
untowardness
of
her
fate
which
would
let
nothing
run
smooth
lord
rufford
was
to
come
that
at
any
rate
was
now
almost
certain
up
to
the
present
she
had
doubted
knowing
the
way
in
which
such
men
will
change
their
engagements
at
the
least
caprice
but
the
duchess
expected
him
on
the
morrow
she
had
prepared
the
way
for
meeting
him
as
an
old
friend
without
causing
surprise
and
had
gained
that
step
but
should
she
succeed
as
she
hoped
in
exacting
continued
homage
from
the
man
homage
for
the
four
or
five
days
of
his
sojourn
at
mistletoe
this
must
be
carried
on
with
the
knowledge
on
the
part
of
many
in
the
house
that
she
was
engaged
to
that
horrid
patagonian
minister
was
ever
a
girl
called
upon
to
risk
her
entire
fate
under
so
many
disadvantages
when
she
went
up
to
dress
for
dinner
on
the
day
of
his
expected
arrival
lord
rufford
had
not
come
since
the
interview
in
her
room
she
had
not
heard
his
name
mentioned
when
she
came
into
the
a
little
late
he
was
not
there
we
wo
wait
duchess
said
the
duke
to
his
wife
at
three
minutes
past
eight
the
duke
punctuality
at
was
well
known
and
everybody
else
was
then
assembled
within
two
minutes
after
the
duke
word
dinner
was
announced
and
a
party
numbering
about
thirty
walked
away
into
the
arabella
when
they
were
all
settled
found
that
there
was
a
vacant
seat
next
herself
if
the
man
were
to
come
fortune
would
have
favoured
her
in
that
the
fish
and
soup
had
already
disappeared
and
the
duke
was
wakening
himself
to
eloquence
on
the
first
entrée
when
lord
rufford
entered
the
room
there
never
were
trains
so
late
as
yours
duchess
he
said
nor
any
part
of
the
world
in
which
hired
horses
travel
so
slowly
i
beg
the
duke
pardon
but
i
suffer
the
less
because
i
know
his
grace
never
waits
for
anybody
certainly
not
said
the
duke
having
some
regard
for
my
dinners
and
i
find
myself
next
to
you
said
lord
rufford
as
he
took
his
seat
well
that
is
more
than
i
deserve
chapter
x
how
things
were
arranged
jack
is
here
said
lord
rufford
as
soon
as
the
fuss
of
his
late
arrival
had
worn
itself
away
i
shall
be
proud
to
renew
my
acquaintance
can
you
come
oh
yes
said
arabella
rapturously
there
are
difficulties
and
i
ought
to
have
written
to
you
about
them
i
am
going
with
the
fitzwilliam
now
mistletoe
was
in
lincolnshire
not
very
far
from
peterborough
not
very
far
from
stamford
not
very
far
from
oakham
a
regular
hunting
man
like
lord
rufford
knew
how
to
compass
the
difficulties
of
distance
in
all
hunting
countries
horses
could
go
by
one
train
or
overnight
and
he
could
follow
by
another
and
a
postchaise
could
meet
him
here
or
there
but
when
a
lady
is
added
the
difficulty
is
often
increased
fivefold
is
it
very
far
asked
arabella
it
is
a
little
far
i
wonder
who
are
going
from
here
heaven
only
knows
i
have
passed
my
time
in
playing
cat
cradle
with
sir
jeffrey
bunker
for
the
amusement
of
the
company
and
in
confidential
communications
with
my
aunt
and
lady
drummond
i
heard
hunting
mentioned
have
you
anything
on
wheels
going
across
to
holcombe
cross
duke
asked
lord
rufford
the
duke
said
that
he
did
not
know
of
anything
on
wheels
going
to
holcombe
cross
then
a
hunting
man
who
had
heard
the
question
said
that
he
and
another
intended
to
travel
by
train
to
oundle
upon
this
lord
rufford
turned
round
and
looked
at
arabella
mournfully
can
not
i
go
by
train
to
oundle
she
asked
nothing
on
earth
so
jolly
if
your
pastors
and
masters
and
all
that
will
let
you
i
have
got
any
pastors
and
masters
the
duchess
suggested
lord
rufford
i
thought
all
that
kind
of
nonsense
was
over
said
arabella
i
believe
a
great
deal
is
over
you
can
do
many
things
that
your
mother
and
grandmother
could
do
but
absolute
freedom
what
you
may
call
universal
suffrage
has
come
yet
i
fear
it
twenty
miles
by
road
and
the
duchess
would
say
something
awful
if
i
were
to
propose
to
take
you
in
a
postchaise
but
the
railway
i
afraid
that
would
be
worse
we
could
ride
back
you
know
as
we
did
at
rufford
at
the
best
it
would
be
rather
a
rough
and
tumble
kind
of
arrangement
i
afraid
we
must
put
it
off
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
the
least
bit
in
the
world
afraid
of
the
duchess
i
am
not
at
all
said
arabella
angrily
then
lord
rufford
ate
his
dinner
and
seemed
to
think
that
that
matter
was
settled
arabella
knew
that
he
might
have
hunted
elsewhere
that
the
cottesmore
would
be
out
in
their
own
county
within
twelve
miles
of
them
and
that
the
difficulty
of
that
ride
would
be
very
much
less
the
duke
might
have
been
persuaded
to
send
a
carriage
that
distance
but
lord
rufford
cared
more
about
the
chance
of
a
good
run
than
her
company
for
a
while
she
was
sulky
for
a
little
while
till
she
remembered
how
ill
she
could
afford
to
indulge
in
such
a
feeling
then
she
said
a
demure
word
or
two
to
the
gentleman
on
the
other
side
of
her
who
happened
to
be
a
clergyman
and
did
not
return
to
the
hunting
till
lord
rufford
had
eaten
his
cheese
and
is
that
to
be
the
end
of
jack
as
far
as
i
concerned
i
have
been
thinking
about
it
ever
since
this
is
thursday
not
a
doubt
about
it
will
be
friday
and
the
duke
has
his
great
shooting
on
saturday
there
nothing
within
a
hundred
miles
of
us
on
saturday
i
shall
go
with
the
pytchley
if
i
do
shoot
but
i
shall
have
to
get
up
just
when
other
people
are
going
to
bed
that
would
suit
you
i
would
mind
if
i
did
go
to
bed
at
all
at
any
rate
it
would
suit
the
duchess
i
had
meant
to
go
away
on
sunday
i
hate
being
anywhere
on
sunday
except
in
a
railway
carriage
but
if
i
thought
the
duke
would
keep
me
till
tuesday
morning
we
might
manage
peltry
on
monday
i
meant
to
have
got
back
to
surbiton
on
sunday
and
have
gone
from
there
where
is
peltry
it
a
cottesmore
meet
about
five
miles
this
side
of
melton
we
could
ride
from
here
it
rather
far
for
that
but
we
could
talk
over
the
duke
to
send
a
carriage
ladies
always
like
to
see
a
meet
and
perhaps
we
could
make
a
party
if
not
we
must
put
a
good
face
on
it
and
go
in
anything
we
can
get
i
should
fear
the
duchess
so
much
for
twelve
miles
as
i
should
for
twenty
i
do
mean
to
let
the
duchess
interfere
with
me
said
arabella
in
a
whisper
that
evening
lord
rufford
was
very
and
managed
to
arrange
everything
lady
chiltern
and
another
lady
said
that
they
would
be
glad
to
go
to
the
meet
and
a
carriage
or
carriages
were
organised
but
nothing
was
said
as
to
arabella
hunting
because
the
question
would
immediately
be
raised
as
to
her
return
to
mistletoe
in
the
evening
it
was
however
understood
that
she
was
to
have
a
place
in
the
carriage
arabella
had
gained
two
things
she
would
have
her
one
day
hunting
and
she
had
secured
the
presence
of
lord
rufford
at
mistletoe
for
sunday
with
such
a
man
as
his
lordship
it
was
almost
impossible
to
find
a
moment
for
confidential
conversation
he
worked
so
hard
at
his
amusements
that
he
was
as
bad
a
lover
as
a
barrister
who
has
to
be
in
court
all
day
almost
as
bad
as
a
sailor
who
is
always
going
round
the
world
on
this
evening
it
was
ten
before
the
gentlemen
came
into
the
and
then
lord
rufford
time
was
spent
in
arranging
the
party
for
the
meet
on
monday
when
the
ladies
went
up
to
bed
arabella
had
had
no
other
opportunity
than
what
fortune
had
given
her
at
dinner
and
even
then
she
had
been
watched
that
juxtaposition
at
the
had
come
of
chance
and
had
been
caused
by
lord
late
arrival
old
sir
jeffrey
should
have
been
her
neighbour
with
the
clergyman
on
the
other
side
an
arrangement
which
her
grace
had
thought
safe
with
reference
to
the
rights
of
the
minister
to
patagonia
the
duchess
though
she
was
at
some
distance
down
the
table
had
seen
that
her
niece
and
lord
rufford
were
intimate
and
remembered
immediately
what
had
been
said
they
could
not
have
talked
as
they
were
then
talking
sometimes
whispering
as
the
duchess
could
perceive
very
well
unless
there
had
been
considerable
former
intimacy
she
began
gradually
to
understand
various
things
why
arabella
trefoil
had
been
so
anxious
to
come
to
mistletoe
just
at
this
time
why
she
had
behaved
so
unlike
her
usual
self
before
lord
rufford
arrival
and
why
she
had
been
so
unwilling
to
have
morton
invited
the
duchess
was
in
her
way
a
clever
woman
and
could
see
many
things
she
could
see
that
though
her
niece
might
be
very
anxious
to
marry
lord
rufford
lord
rufford
might
indulge
himself
in
a
close
intimacy
with
the
girl
without
any
such
intention
on
his
part
and
as
far
as
the
family
was
concerned
she
would
have
been
quite
contented
with
the
morton
alliance
she
would
have
asked
morton
now
only
that
it
would
be
impossible
that
he
should
come
in
time
to
be
of
service
had
she
been
consulted
in
the
first
instance
she
would
have
put
her
veto
on
that
drive
to
the
meet
but
she
had
heard
nothing
about
it
until
lady
chiltern
had
said
that
she
would
go
the
duchess
of
omnium
had
since
declared
that
she
also
would
go
and
there
were
to
be
two
carriages
but
still
it
never
occurred
to
the
duchess
that
arabella
intended
to
hunt
nor
did
arabella
intend
that
she
should
know
it
till
the
morning
came
the
friday
was
very
dull
the
hunting
men
of
course
had
gone
before
arabella
came
down
to
breakfast
she
would
willingly
have
got
up
at
seven
to
pour
out
lord
rufford
tea
had
that
been
possible
but
as
it
was
she
strolled
into
the
breakfast
room
at
ten
she
could
see
by
her
aunt
eye
and
hear
in
her
voice
that
she
was
in
part
detected
and
that
she
would
do
herself
no
further
service
by
acting
the
good
girl
and
she
therefore
resolutely
determined
to
listen
to
no
more
twaddle
she
read
a
french
novel
which
she
had
brought
with
her
and
spent
as
much
of
the
day
as
she
could
in
her
bedroom
she
did
not
see
lord
rufford
before
dinner
and
at
dinner
sat
between
sir
jeffrey
and
an
old
gentleman
out
of
stamford
who
dined
at
mistletoe
that
evening
we
had
no
such
luck
lord
rufford
said
to
her
in
the
the
old
dragon
took
care
of
that
replied
arabella
why
should
the
old
dragon
think
that
i
dangerous
because
i
ca
very
well
tell
you
why
but
i
dare
say
you
know
and
do
you
think
i
am
dangerous
you
a
sort
of
a
gate
said
arabella
laughing
of
course
there
is
a
little
danger
but
who
is
going
to
be
stopped
by
that
he
could
make
no
reply
to
this
because
the
duchess
called
him
away
to
give
some
account
to
lady
chiltern
about
goarly
and
the
lady
chiltern
husband
being
a
master
of
hounds
and
a
great
authority
on
all
matters
relating
to
hunting
nasty
old
dragon
arabella
said
to
herself
when
she
was
thus
left
alone
the
saturday
was
the
day
of
the
great
shooting
and
at
two
the
ladies
went
out
to
lunch
with
the
gentlemen
by
the
side
of
the
wood
lord
rufford
had
at
last
consented
to
be
one
of
the
party
with
logs
of
trees
a
few
hurdles
and
other
field
appliances
a
rustic
banqueting
hall
was
prepared
and
everything
was
very
nice
tons
of
game
had
been
killed
and
tons
more
were
to
be
killed
after
luncheon
the
duchess
was
not
there
and
arabella
contrived
so
to
place
herself
that
she
could
be
waited
upon
by
lord
rufford
or
could
wait
upon
him
of
course
a
great
many
eyes
were
upon
her
but
she
knew
how
to
sustain
that
nobody
was
present
who
could
dare
to
interfere
with
her
when
the
eating
and
drinking
were
over
she
walked
with
him
to
his
corner
by
the
next
covert
not
heeding
the
other
ladies
and
she
stood
with
him
for
some
minutes
after
the
slaughter
had
begun
she
had
come
to
feel
that
the
time
was
slipping
between
her
fingers
and
that
she
must
say
something
effective
the
fatal
word
upon
which
everything
would
depend
must
be
spoken
at
the
very
latest
on
their
return
home
on
monday
and
she
was
aware
that
much
must
probably
be
said
before
that
do
we
hunt
or
shoot
she
said
is
sunday
i
am
quite
aware
of
that
but
i
did
know
whether
you
could
live
a
day
without
sport
the
country
is
so
full
of
prejudice
that
i
am
driven
to
sabbatical
quiescence
take
a
walk
with
me
said
arabella
but
the
duchess
exclaimed
lord
rufford
in
a
stage
whisper
one
of
the
beaters
was
so
near
that
he
could
not
but
have
heard
but
what
does
a
beater
signify
the
duchess
you
be
at
the
path
behind
the
great
conservatory
at
three
and
we
wo
mind
the
duchess
lord
rufford
was
forced
to
ask
for
many
other
particulars
as
to
the
locality
and
then
promised
that
he
would
be
there
at
the
time
named
chapter
xi
you
are
so
severe
on
the
next
morning
arabella
went
to
church
as
did
of
course
a
great
many
of
the
party
by
remaining
at
home
she
could
only
have
excited
suspicion
the
church
was
close
to
the
house
and
the
family
pew
consisted
of
a
large
room
screened
off
from
the
rest
of
the
church
with
a
of
its
own
so
that
the
labour
of
attending
divine
service
was
reduced
to
a
minimum
at
two
they
lunched
and
that
amusement
lasted
nearly
an
hour
there
was
an
afternoon
service
at
three
in
attending
which
the
duchess
was
very
particular
the
duke
never
went
at
that
time
nor
was
it
expected
that
any
of
the
gentlemen
would
do
so
but
women
are
supposed
to
require
more
church
than
men
and
the
duchess
rather
made
it
a
point
that
at
any
rate
the
young
ladies
staying
in
the
house
should
accompany
her
over
the
other
young
ladies
there
her
authority
could
only
be
that
of
influence
but
such
authority
generally
sufficed
from
her
niece
it
might
be
supposed
that
she
would
exact
obedience
and
in
this
instance
she
tried
it
we
start
in
five
minutes
she
said
to
arabella
as
that
young
lady
was
loitering
at
the
table
do
wait
for
me
aunt
i
not
going
said
arabella
boldly
i
hope
you
will
come
to
church
with
us
said
the
duchess
sternly
not
this
afternoon
why
not
arabella
i
never
do
go
to
church
twice
on
sundays
some
people
do
and
some
people
do
i
suppose
that
about
it
i
think
that
all
young
women
ought
to
go
to
church
on
sunday
afternoon
unless
there
is
something
particular
to
prevent
them
arabella
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
the
duchess
stalked
angrily
away
that
makes
me
feel
so
awfully
wicked
said
the
duchess
of
omnium
who
was
the
only
other
lady
then
left
in
the
room
then
she
got
up
and
went
out
and
arabella
of
course
followed
her
lord
rufford
had
heard
it
all
but
had
stood
at
the
window
and
said
nothing
he
had
not
been
to
church
at
all
and
was
quite
accustomed
to
the
idea
that
as
a
young
nobleman
who
only
lived
for
pleasure
he
was
privileged
to
be
wicked
had
the
duchess
of
mayfair
been
blessed
with
a
third
daughter
fit
for
marriage
she
would
not
have
thought
of
repudiating
such
a
suitor
as
lord
rufford
because
he
did
not
go
to
church
when
the
house
was
cleared
arabella
went
upstairs
and
put
on
her
hat
it
was
a
bright
beautiful
winter
day
not
painfully
cold
because
the
air
was
dry
but
still
a
day
that
warranted
furs
and
a
muff
having
prepared
herself
she
made
her
way
alone
to
a
side
door
which
led
from
a
branch
of
the
hall
on
to
the
garden
terrace
and
up
and
down
that
she
walked
two
or
three
times
so
that
any
of
the
household
that
saw
her
might
perceive
that
she
had
come
out
simply
for
exercise
at
the
end
of
the
third
turn
instead
of
coming
back
she
went
on
quickly
to
the
conservatory
and
took
the
path
which
led
round
to
the
further
side
there
was
a
small
lawn
here
fitted
for
garden
games
and
on
the
other
end
of
it
an
iron
gate
leading
to
a
path
into
the
woods
at
the
further
side
of
the
iron
gate
and
leaning
against
it
stood
lord
rufford
smoking
a
cigar
she
did
not
pause
a
moment
but
hurried
across
the
lawn
to
join
him
he
opened
the
gate
and
she
passed
through
i
not
going
to
be
done
by
a
dragon
she
said
as
she
took
her
place
alongside
of
him
upon
my
word
miss
trefoil
i
do
think
i
ever
knew
a
human
being
with
so
much
pluck
as
you
have
got
girls
have
to
have
pluck
if
they
do
mean
to
be
sat
upon
a
great
deal
more
than
men
the
idea
of
telling
me
that
i
was
to
go
to
church
as
though
i
were
twelve
years
old
what
would
she
say
if
she
knew
that
you
were
walking
here
with
me
i
do
care
what
she
say
i
dare
say
she
walked
with
somebody
once
only
i
should
think
the
somebody
must
have
found
it
very
dull
does
she
know
that
you
to
hunt
i
have
told
her
and
do
mean
i
shall
just
come
down
in
my
habit
and
hat
and
say
nothing
about
it
at
what
time
must
we
start
the
carriages
are
ordered
for
nine
but
i
afraid
you
have
clearly
before
your
eyes
all
the
difficulties
which
are
incidental
to
hunting
what
do
you
mean
it
looks
as
like
a
black
frost
as
anything
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
but
we
should
go
the
horses
wo
be
there
if
there
is
a
really
hard
frost
nobody
would
stir
it
will
be
the
first
question
i
shall
ask
the
man
when
he
comes
to
me
and
if
there
have
been
seven
or
eight
degrees
of
frost
i
sha
get
up
how
am
i
to
know
my
man
shall
tell
your
maid
but
everybody
will
soon
know
all
about
it
it
will
alter
everything
i
think
i
shall
go
mad
in
white
satin
no
in
my
habit
and
hat
it
will
be
the
hardest
thing
after
all
i
ought
to
have
insisted
on
going
to
holcombe
cross
on
friday
the
sun
is
shining
now
surely
it
can
not
freeze
it
will
be
uncommonly
if
it
does
but
after
all
the
hunting
was
not
the
main
point
the
hunting
had
been
only
intended
as
an
opportunity
and
if
that
were
to
be
lost
in
which
case
lord
rufford
would
no
doubt
at
once
leave
mistletoe
there
was
the
more
need
for
using
the
present
hour
the
more
for
using
even
the
present
minute
though
she
had
said
that
the
sun
was
shining
it
was
the
setting
sun
and
in
another
half
hour
the
gloom
of
the
evening
would
be
there
even
lord
rufford
would
not
consent
to
walk
about
with
her
in
the
dark
oh
lord
rufford
she
said
i
did
so
look
forward
to
your
giving
me
another
lead
then
she
put
her
hand
upon
his
arm
and
left
it
there
it
would
have
been
nice
said
he
drawing
her
hand
a
little
on
and
remembering
as
he
did
so
his
own
picture
of
himself
on
the
cliff
with
his
sister
holding
his
if
you
could
possibly
know
she
said
the
condition
i
am
in
what
condition
i
know
that
i
can
trust
you
i
am
sure
that
i
can
trust
you
oh
dear
yes
if
you
mean
about
telling
i
never
tell
anything
that
what
i
do
mean
you
remember
that
man
at
your
place
what
man
poor
caneback
oh
dear
no
i
wish
they
could
change
places
because
then
he
could
give
me
no
more
trouble
that
wishing
him
to
be
dead
whoever
he
is
yes
why
should
he
persecute
me
i
mean
that
man
we
were
staying
with
at
bragton
mr
morton
of
course
i
do
do
you
remember
your
asking
me
about
him
and
my
telling
you
that
i
was
not
engaged
to
him
i
remember
that
mamma
and
this
horrid
old
duchess
here
want
me
to
marry
him
got
an
idea
that
he
is
going
to
be
ambassador
at
pekin
or
something
very
grand
and
they
at
me
day
and
night
you
need
take
him
unless
you
like
him
they
do
make
me
so
miserable
and
then
she
leaned
heavily
upon
his
arm
he
was
a
man
who
could
not
stand
such
pressure
as
this
without
returning
it
though
he
were
on
the
precipice
and
though
he
must
go
over
still
he
could
not
stand
it
you
remember
that
night
after
the
ball
indeed
i
do
and
you
too
had
asked
me
whether
i
cared
for
that
horrid
man
i
did
see
anything
horrid
you
had
been
staying
at
his
house
and
people
had
told
me
what
was
i
to
think
you
ought
to
have
known
what
to
think
there
let
me
go
for
now
he
had
got
his
arm
round
her
waist
you
do
care
for
me
a
bit
i
know
you
do
it
would
be
all
the
same
to
you
whom
i
married
or
whether
i
died
you
do
think
that
bella
he
fancied
that
he
had
heard
her
mother
call
her
bella
and
that
the
name
was
softer
and
easier
than
the
full
four
syllables
it
was
at
any
rate
something
for
her
to
have
gained
i
do
think
it
when
i
came
here
on
purpose
to
have
a
skurry
over
the
country
with
you
you
went
away
to
holcombe
cross
though
you
could
have
hunted
here
close
in
the
neighbourhood
and
now
you
tell
me
there
will
be
a
frost
can
i
help
that
darling
darling
i
ai
your
darling
you
do
care
a
bit
for
me
i
believe
you
hope
there
be
a
frost
he
pressed
her
tighter
but
laughed
as
he
did
so
it
was
evidently
a
joke
to
him
a
pleasant
joke
no
doubt
leave
me
alone
lord
rufford
i
wo
let
you
for
i
know
you
do
love
me
very
suddenly
he
did
leave
his
hold
of
her
and
stood
erect
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
for
the
rustle
of
a
dress
was
heard
it
was
still
daylight
but
the
light
was
dim
and
the
last
morsel
of
the
grandeur
of
the
sun
had
ceased
to
be
visible
through
the
trees
the
people
had
been
released
and
the
duchess
having
probably
heard
certain
tidings
had
herself
come
to
take
a
walk
in
the
shrubbery
behind
the
conservatory
arabella
had
probably
been
unaware
that
she
and
her
companion
by
a
turn
in
the
walks
were
being
brought
back
towards
the
iron
gate
as
it
was
they
met
the
duchess
face
to
face
lord
rufford
had
spoken
the
truth
when
he
had
said
that
he
was
a
little
afraid
of
the
duchess
such
was
his
fear
that
at
the
moment
he
hardly
knew
what
he
was
to
say
arabella
had
boasted
when
she
had
declared
that
she
was
not
at
all
afraid
of
her
aunt
but
she
was
steadfastly
minded
that
she
would
not
be
cowed
by
her
fears
she
had
known
beforehand
that
she
would
have
occasion
for
much
presence
of
mind
and
was
prepared
to
exercise
it
at
a
moment
notice
she
was
the
first
to
speak
is
that
you
aunt
you
are
out
of
church
very
soon
lord
rufford
said
the
duchess
i
do
think
this
is
a
proper
time
for
walking
out
do
you
duchess
the
air
is
very
nice
it
is
becoming
dark
and
my
niece
had
better
return
to
the
house
with
me
arabella
you
can
come
this
way
it
is
just
as
short
as
the
other
if
you
go
on
straight
lord
rufford
it
will
take
you
to
the
house
of
course
lord
rufford
went
on
straight
and
of
course
arabella
had
to
turn
with
her
aunt
such
conduct
as
this
is
shocking
began
the
duchess
aunt
let
me
tell
you
what
can
you
tell
me
i
can
tell
you
a
great
deal
if
you
will
let
me
of
course
i
am
quite
prepared
to
own
that
i
did
not
intend
to
tell
you
anything
i
can
well
believe
that
because
i
could
hardly
hope
for
your
sympathy
you
have
never
liked
me
you
have
no
right
to
say
that
i
do
do
it
in
the
way
of
finding
fault
i
do
know
why
you
should
but
i
have
been
too
much
afraid
of
you
to
tell
you
my
secrets
i
must
do
so
now
because
you
have
found
me
walking
with
lord
rufford
i
could
not
otherwise
excuse
myself
is
he
engaged
to
marry
you
he
has
asked
me
no
but
he
has
aunt
you
must
be
a
little
patient
and
let
me
tell
it
you
all
mamma
did
make
up
an
engagement
between
me
and
morton
at
washington
did
you
know
lord
rufford
then
i
knew
him
but
did
not
think
he
was
behaving
quite
well
it
is
very
hard
sometimes
to
know
what
a
man
means
i
was
angry
when
i
went
to
washington
he
has
told
me
since
that
he
loves
me
and
has
offered
but
you
are
engaged
to
marry
the
other
man
nothing
on
earth
shall
make
me
marry
morton
mamma
did
it
and
mamma
now
has
very
nearly
broken
it
off
because
she
says
he
is
very
shabby
about
money
indeed
it
is
broken
off
i
had
told
him
so
even
before
lord
rufford
had
proposed
to
me
when
did
he
propose
and
where
at
rufford
we
were
staying
there
in
november
and
you
asked
to
come
here
that
you
might
meet
him
just
so
was
that
strange
where
could
i
be
better
pleased
to
meet
him
than
in
my
own
uncle
house
yes
if
you
had
told
us
all
this
before
perhaps
i
ought
but
you
are
so
severe
that
i
did
not
dare
do
not
turn
against
me
now
my
uncle
could
not
but
like
that
his
niece
should
marry
lord
rufford
how
can
i
turn
against
you
if
it
is
settled
lord
rufford
can
do
as
he
pleases
has
he
told
your
father
or
your
mother
mamma
knows
it
but
not
from
him
asked
the
duchess
arabella
paused
a
moment
but
hardly
a
moment
before
she
answered
it
was
hard
upon
her
that
she
should
have
to
make
up
her
mind
on
matters
of
such
importance
with
so
little
time
for
consideration
yes
she
said
mamma
knows
it
from
him
papa
is
so
very
indifferent
about
everything
that
lord
rufford
has
not
spoken
to
him
if
so
it
will
be
best
that
the
duke
should
speak
to
him
there
was
another
pause
but
hardly
long
enough
to
attract
notice
perhaps
so
she
said
but
not
quite
yet
he
is
so
peculiar
so
touchy
the
duke
is
not
quite
like
my
father
and
he
would
think
himself
suspected
i
can
not
imagine
that
if
he
is
in
earnest
that
is
because
you
do
not
know
him
as
i
do
only
think
where
i
should
be
if
i
were
to
lose
him
lose
him
oh
aunt
now
that
you
know
it
i
do
hope
that
you
will
be
my
friend
it
would
kill
me
if
he
were
to
throw
me
over
but
why
should
he
throw
you
over
if
he
proposed
to
you
only
last
month
he
might
do
it
if
he
thought
that
he
were
interfered
with
of
course
i
should
like
my
uncle
to
speak
to
him
but
not
quite
immediately
if
he
were
to
say
that
he
had
changed
his
mind
what
could
i
do
or
what
could
my
uncle
do
that
would
be
very
singular
conduct
men
are
so
different
now
aunt
they
give
themselves
so
much
more
latitude
a
man
has
only
to
say
that
he
has
changed
his
mind
and
nothing
ever
comes
of
it
i
have
never
been
used
to
such
men
my
dear
at
any
rate
do
not
ask
the
duke
to
speak
to
him
i
will
think
about
it
and
perhaps
you
will
let
me
see
you
after
we
all
come
in
to
this
the
duchess
gravely
assented
and
i
hope
you
be
angry
because
you
found
me
walking
with
him
or
because
i
did
not
go
to
church
it
is
everything
to
me
i
am
sure
dear
aunt
you
will
understand
that
to
this
the
duchess
made
no
reply
and
they
both
entered
the
house
together
what
became
of
lord
rufford
neither
of
them
saw
arabella
when
she
regained
her
room
thought
that
upon
the
whole
fortune
had
favoured
her
by
throwing
her
aunt
in
her
way
she
had
no
doubt
been
driven
to
tell
a
series
of
barefaced
impudent
lies
lies
of
such
a
nature
that
they
almost
made
her
own
hair
stand
on
end
as
she
thought
of
them
but
they
would
matter
nothing
if
she
succeeded
and
if
she
failed
in
this
matter
she
did
not
care
much
what
her
aunt
thought
of
her
her
aunt
might
now
do
her
a
good
turn
and
some
lies
she
must
have
told
such
had
been
the
emergencies
of
her
position
as
she
thought
of
it
all
she
was
glad
that
her
aunt
had
met
her
and
when
lord
rufford
was
summoned
to
take
her
out
to
dinner
on
that
very
sunday
a
matter
as
to
which
her
aunt
managed
everything
herself
she
was
immediately
aware
that
her
lies
had
done
her
good
service
this
was
more
than
i
expected
lord
rufford
said
when
they
were
seated
she
knew
that
she
had
overdone
it
when
she
sent
you
away
in
that
cavalier
way
replied
arabella
and
now
she
wants
to
show
that
she
did
mean
anything
chapter
xii
the
day
at
peltry
the
duchess
did
tell
the
duke
the
whole
story
about
lord
rufford
and
arabella
that
night
as
to
which
it
may
be
said
that
she
also
was
false
but
according
to
her
conscience
there
were
two
ways
of
telling
such
a
secret
as
a
matter
of
course
she
told
her
husband
everything
that
idle
placid
man
was
in
truth
consulted
about
each
detail
of
the
house
and
family
but
the
secret
was
told
to
him
with
injunctions
that
he
was
to
say
nothing
about
it
to
any
one
for
hours
after
that
the
duchess
was
of
opinion
that
he
should
speak
to
lord
rufford
what
could
i
say
to
him
asked
the
duke
i
not
her
father
but
your
brother
is
so
indifferent
no
doubt
but
that
gives
me
no
authority
if
he
does
mean
to
marry
the
girl
he
must
go
to
her
father
or
it
is
possible
that
he
might
come
to
me
but
if
he
does
not
mean
it
what
can
i
do
he
promised
however
that
he
would
think
of
it
it
was
still
dark
night
or
the
morning
was
still
dark
as
night
when
arabella
got
out
of
bed
and
opened
her
window
the
coming
of
a
frost
now
might
ruin
her
the
absence
of
it
might
give
her
everything
in
life
that
she
wanted
lord
rufford
had
promised
her
a
tedious
communication
through
servants
as
to
the
state
of
the
weather
she
was
far
too
energetic
far
too
much
in
earnest
to
wait
for
that
she
opened
the
window
and
putting
out
her
hand
she
felt
a
drizzle
of
rain
and
the
air
though
the
damp
from
it
seemed
to
chill
her
all
through
was
not
a
frosty
air
she
stood
there
a
minute
so
as
to
be
sure
and
then
retreated
to
her
bed
fortune
was
again
favouring
her
but
then
how
would
it
be
if
it
should
turn
to
hard
rain
in
that
case
lady
chiltern
and
the
other
ladies
certainly
would
not
go
and
how
in
such
case
should
she
get
herself
conveyed
to
the
meet
she
would
at
any
rate
go
down
in
her
hat
and
habit
and
trust
that
somebody
would
provide
for
her
there
might
be
much
that
would
be
disagreeable
and
difficult
but
hardly
anything
could
be
worse
than
the
necessity
of
telling
such
lies
as
those
which
she
had
fabricated
on
the
previous
afternoon
she
had
been
much
in
doubt
whether
her
aunt
had
or
had
not
believed
her
that
the
belief
was
not
a
thorough
belief
she
was
almost
certain
but
then
there
was
the
great
fact
that
after
the
story
had
been
told
she
had
been
sent
out
to
dinner
leaning
on
lord
arm
unless
her
aunt
had
believed
something
that
would
not
have
taken
place
and
then
so
much
of
it
was
true
surely
it
would
be
impossible
that
he
should
not
propose
after
what
had
occurred
her
aunt
was
evidently
alive
to
the
advantage
of
the
marriage
to
the
advantage
which
would
accrue
not
to
her
arabella
individually
but
to
the
trefoils
generally
she
almost
thought
that
her
aunt
would
not
put
spokes
in
her
wheel
for
this
day
she
wished
now
that
she
had
told
her
aunt
that
she
intended
to
hunt
so
that
there
need
not
be
any
surprise
she
slept
again
and
again
looked
out
of
the
window
it
rained
a
little
but
still
there
were
hours
in
which
the
rain
might
cease
again
she
slept
and
at
eight
her
maid
brought
her
word
that
there
would
be
hunting
it
did
rain
a
little
but
very
little
of
course
she
would
dress
herself
in
riding
attire
at
nine
she
walked
into
the
breakfast
parlour
properly
equipped
for
the
day
sport
there
were
four
or
five
men
there
in
red
coats
and
top
boots
among
whom
lord
rufford
was
conspicuous
they
were
just
seating
themselves
at
the
breakfast
table
and
her
aunt
was
already
in
her
place
lady
chiltern
had
come
into
the
room
with
herself
and
at
the
door
had
spoken
some
words
of
surprise
i
did
not
know
that
you
were
a
sportswoman
miss
trefoil
i
do
ride
a
little
when
i
am
well
mounted
arabella
had
said
as
she
entered
the
room
then
she
collected
herself
and
arranged
her
countenance
and
endeavoured
to
look
as
though
she
were
doing
the
most
ordinary
thing
in
the
world
she
went
round
the
room
and
kissed
her
aunt
brow
this
she
had
not
done
on
any
other
morning
but
then
on
other
mornings
she
had
been
late
are
you
going
to
ride
said
the
duchess
i
believe
so
aunt
who
is
giving
you
a
horse
lord
rufford
is
lending
me
one
i
do
think
even
his
will
extend
to
giving
away
so
perfect
an
animal
i
know
him
well
for
i
rode
him
when
i
was
at
rufford
this
she
said
so
that
all
the
room
should
hear
her
you
need
not
be
afraid
duchess
said
lord
rufford
he
is
quite
safe
and
his
name
is
jack
said
arabella
laughing
as
she
took
her
place
with
a
little
air
of
triumph
lord
rufford
offered
to
let
me
have
him
all
the
time
i
was
here
but
i
did
know
whether
you
would
take
me
in
so
attended
there
was
not
one
who
heard
her
who
did
not
feel
that
she
spoke
as
though
lord
rufford
were
all
her
own
lord
rufford
felt
it
himself
and
almost
thought
he
might
as
well
turn
himself
round
and
bid
his
sister
and
miss
penge
let
him
go
he
must
marry
some
day
and
why
should
not
this
girl
do
as
well
as
any
one
else
the
duchess
did
not
approve
of
young
ladies
hunting
she
certainly
would
not
have
had
her
niece
at
mistletoe
had
she
expected
such
a
performance
but
she
could
not
find
fault
now
there
was
a
feeling
in
her
bosom
that
if
there
were
an
engagement
it
would
be
cruel
to
cause
obstructions
she
certainly
could
not
allow
a
lover
in
her
house
for
her
niece
without
having
official
authenticated
knowledge
of
the
respectability
of
the
lover
but
the
whole
thing
had
come
upon
her
so
suddenly
that
she
was
at
a
loss
what
to
do
or
what
to
say
it
certainly
did
not
seem
to
her
that
arabella
was
in
the
least
afraid
of
being
found
out
in
any
untruth
if
the
girl
were
about
to
become
lady
rufford
then
it
would
be
for
lord
rufford
to
decide
whether
or
no
she
should
hunt
soon
after
this
the
duke
came
in
and
he
also
alluded
to
his
niece
costume
and
was
informed
that
she
was
to
ride
one
of
lord
rufford
horses
i
did
hear
it
mentioned
before
said
the
duke
he
carry
miss
trefoil
quite
safely
said
lord
rufford
who
was
at
the
moment
standing
over
a
game
pie
on
the
sideboard
then
the
subject
was
allowed
to
drop
at
nine
there
was
no
rain
and
the
ladies
were
so
nearly
punctual
that
the
carriages
absolutely
started
at
ten
some
of
the
men
rode
on
one
got
a
seat
on
the
carriage
and
lord
rufford
drove
himself
and
a
friend
in
a
tandem
the
tandem
was
off
before
the
carriages
but
lord
rufford
assured
them
that
he
would
get
the
master
to
allow
them
a
quarter
of
an
hour
arabella
contrived
to
say
one
word
to
him
if
you
start
without
me
i
never
speak
to
you
again
he
nodded
and
smiled
but
perhaps
thought
that
if
so
it
might
be
as
well
that
he
should
start
without
waiting
for
her
at
the
last
moment
the
duchess
had
taken
it
into
her
head
that
she
too
would
go
to
the
meet
no
doubt
she
was
actuated
by
some
feeling
in
regard
to
her
niece
but
it
was
not
till
arabella
was
absolutely
getting
on
to
jack
at
the
side
of
the
carriage
under
the
auspices
of
jack
owner
that
the
idea
occurred
to
her
grace
that
there
would
be
a
great
difficulty
as
to
the
return
home
arabella
how
do
you
mean
to
get
back
she
asked
that
will
be
all
right
aunt
said
arabella
i
will
see
to
that
said
lord
rufford
the
gracious
but
impatient
master
of
the
hounds
had
absolutely
waited
full
twenty
minutes
for
the
duchess
party
and
was
not
minded
to
wait
a
minute
longer
for
conversation
the
moment
that
the
carriages
were
there
the
huntsmen
had
started
so
that
there
was
an
excuse
for
hurry
lord
rufford
as
he
was
speaking
got
on
to
his
own
horse
and
before
the
duchess
could
expostulate
they
were
away
there
was
a
feeling
of
triumph
in
arabella
bosom
as
she
told
herself
that
she
had
at
any
rate
secured
her
day
hunting
in
spite
of
such
difficulties
the
sport
was
fairly
good
they
had
twenty
minutes
in
the
morning
and
a
kill
then
they
drew
a
big
wood
during
which
they
ate
their
lunch
and
drank
their
sherry
in
the
big
wood
they
found
a
fox
but
could
not
do
anything
with
him
after
that
they
came
on
a
third
in
a
stubble
field
and
ran
him
well
for
half
an
hour
when
he
went
to
ground
it
was
then
three
and
as
the
days
were
now
at
the
shortest
the
master
declined
to
draw
again
they
were
then
about
sixteen
miles
from
mistletoe
and
about
ten
from
stamford
where
lord
rufford
horses
were
standing
the
distance
from
stamford
to
mistletoe
was
eight
lord
rufford
proposed
that
they
should
ride
to
stamford
and
then
go
home
in
a
hired
carriage
there
seemed
indeed
to
be
no
other
way
of
getting
home
without
taking
three
tired
horses
fourteen
miles
out
of
their
way
arabella
made
no
objection
whatever
to
the
arrangement
lord
rufford
did
in
truth
make
a
slight
effort
the
slightest
possible
to
induce
a
third
person
to
join
their
party
there
was
still
something
pulling
at
his
so
that
there
might
yet
be
a
chance
of
saving
him
from
the
precipice
but
he
failed
the
tired
horseman
before
whom
the
suggestion
was
casually
thrown
out
would
have
been
delighted
to
accept
it
instead
of
riding
all
the
way
to
mistletoe
but
he
did
not
look
upon
it
as
made
in
earnest
two
he
knew
were
company
and
three
none
the
hunting
field
is
by
no
means
a
place
suited
for
real
very
much
of
preliminary
conversation
may
be
done
there
in
a
pleasant
way
and
intimacies
may
be
formed
but
when
lovers
have
already
walked
with
arms
round
each
other
in
a
wood
riding
together
may
be
very
pleasant
but
can
hardly
be
ecstatic
lord
rufford
might
indeed
have
asked
her
to
be
lady
while
they
were
breaking
up
the
first
fox
or
as
they
loitered
about
in
the
big
wood
but
she
did
not
expect
that
there
was
no
moment
during
the
day
sport
in
which
she
had
a
right
to
tell
herself
that
he
was
misbehaving
because
he
did
not
so
ask
her
but
in
a
postchaise
it
would
be
different
at
the
inn
at
stamford
the
horses
were
given
up
and
arabella
condescended
to
take
a
glass
of
cherry
brandy
she
had
gone
through
a
long
day
it
was
then
four
and
she
was
not
used
to
be
many
hours
on
horseback
the
fatigue
seemed
to
her
to
be
very
much
greater
than
it
had
been
when
she
got
back
to
rufford
immediately
after
the
fatal
accident
the
ten
miles
along
the
road
which
had
been
done
in
little
more
than
an
hour
had
almost
overcome
her
she
had
determined
not
to
cry
for
mercy
as
the
hard
trot
went
on
she
had
passed
herself
off
as
an
accustomed
horsewoman
and
having
done
so
well
across
the
country
would
not
break
down
coming
home
but
as
she
got
into
the
carriage
she
was
very
tired
she
could
almost
have
cried
with
fatigue
and
yet
she
told
herself
that
now
now
must
the
work
be
done
she
would
perhaps
tell
him
that
she
was
tired
she
might
even
assist
her
cause
by
her
languor
but
though
she
should
die
for
it
she
would
not
waste
her
precious
moments
by
absolute
rest
may
i
light
a
cigar
he
said
as
he
got
in
you
know
you
may
wherever
i
may
be
with
you
do
you
think
that
i
would
interfere
with
your
gratifications
you
are
the
best
girl
in
all
the
world
he
said
as
he
took
out
his
case
and
threw
himself
back
in
the
corner
do
you
call
that
a
long
day
she
asked
when
he
had
lit
his
cigar
not
very
long
because
i
am
so
tired
we
came
home
pretty
sharp
i
thought
it
best
not
to
shock
her
grace
by
too
great
a
stretch
into
the
night
as
it
is
you
will
have
time
to
go
to
bed
for
an
hour
or
two
before
you
dress
that
what
i
do
when
i
am
in
time
you
be
right
as
a
trivet
then
oh
i
right
now
only
tired
it
was
very
nice
pretty
well
we
ought
to
have
killed
that
last
fox
and
why
on
earth
we
made
nothing
of
that
fellow
in
gooseberry
grove
i
understand
old
tony
would
never
have
left
that
fox
alive
above
ground
would
you
like
to
go
to
sleep
o
dear
no
afraid
of
gloves
said
he
drawing
nearer
to
her
they
might
pull
him
as
they
liked
by
his
but
as
he
was
in
a
postchaise
with
her
he
must
make
himself
agreeable
she
shook
her
head
and
laughed
as
she
looked
at
him
through
the
gloom
then
of
course
he
kissed
her
lord
rufford
what
does
this
mean
do
you
know
what
it
means
hardly
it
means
that
i
think
you
the
jolliest
girl
out
i
never
liked
anybody
so
well
as
i
do
you
perhaps
you
never
liked
anybody
said
she
well
yes
i
have
but
i
am
not
going
to
boast
of
what
fortune
has
done
for
me
in
that
way
i
wonder
whether
you
care
for
me
do
you
want
to
know
i
should
like
to
know
you
have
never
said
that
you
did
because
you
have
never
asked
me
am
i
not
asking
you
now
bella
there
are
different
ways
of
asking
but
there
is
only
one
way
that
will
get
an
answer
from
me
no
no
i
will
not
have
it
i
have
allowed
too
much
to
you
already
oh
i
am
so
tired
then
she
sank
back
almost
into
his
arms
but
recovered
herself
very
quickly
lord
rufford
she
said
if
you
are
a
man
of
honour
let
there
be
an
end
of
this
i
am
sure
you
do
not
wish
to
make
me
wretched
i
would
do
anything
to
make
you
happy
then
tell
me
that
you
love
me
honestly
sincerely
with
all
your
heart
and
i
shall
be
happy
you
know
i
do
do
you
do
you
she
said
and
then
she
flung
herself
on
to
his
shoulder
and
for
a
while
she
seemed
to
faint
for
a
few
minutes
she
lay
there
and
as
she
was
lying
she
calculated
whether
it
would
be
better
to
try
at
this
moment
to
drive
him
to
some
clearer
declaration
or
to
make
use
of
what
he
had
already
said
without
giving
him
an
opportunity
of
protesting
that
he
had
not
meant
to
make
her
an
offer
of
marriage
he
had
declared
that
he
loved
her
honestly
and
with
his
whole
heart
would
not
that
justify
her
in
setting
her
uncle
at
him
and
might
it
not
be
that
the
duke
would
carry
great
weight
with
him
that
the
duke
might
induce
him
to
utter
the
fatal
word
though
she
were
she
to
demand
it
now
might
fail
as
she
thought
of
it
all
she
affected
to
swoon
and
almost
herself
believed
that
she
was
swooning
she
was
conscious
but
hardly
more
than
conscious
that
he
was
kissing
her
and
yet
her
brain
was
at
work
she
felt
that
he
would
be
startled
repelled
perhaps
disgusted
were
she
absolutely
to
demand
more
from
him
now
oh
rufford
oh
my
dearest
she
said
as
she
woke
up
and
with
her
face
close
to
his
so
that
he
could
look
into
her
eyes
and
see
their
brightness
even
through
the
gloom
then
she
extricated
herself
from
his
embrace
with
a
shudder
and
a
laugh
you
would
hardly
believe
how
tired
i
am
she
said
putting
out
her
ungloved
hand
he
took
it
and
drew
her
to
him
and
there
she
sat
in
his
arms
for
the
short
remainder
of
the
journey
they
were
now
in
the
park
and
as
the
lights
of
the
house
came
in
sight
he
gave
her
some
counsel
go
up
to
your
room
at
once
dearest
and
lay
down
i
will
i
do
think
i
could
go
in
among
them
i
should
fall
i
will
see
the
duchess
and
tell
her
that
you
are
all
right
but
very
tired
if
she
goes
up
to
you
you
had
better
see
her
oh
yes
but
i
had
rather
not
she
be
sure
to
come
and
bella
jack
must
be
yours
now
you
are
joking
never
more
serious
in
my
life
of
course
he
must
remain
with
me
just
at
present
but
he
is
your
horse
then
as
the
carriage
was
stopping
she
took
his
hand
and
kissed
it
she
got
to
her
room
as
quickly
as
possible
and
then
before
she
had
even
taken
off
her
hat
she
sat
down
to
think
of
it
all
sending
her
maid
away
meanwhile
to
fetch
her
a
cup
of
tea
he
must
have
meant
it
for
an
offer
there
had
at
any
rate
been
enough
to
justify
her
in
so
taking
it
the
present
he
had
made
to
her
of
the
horse
could
mean
nothing
else
under
no
other
circumstances
would
it
be
possible
that
she
should
either
take
the
horse
or
use
him
certainly
it
was
an
offer
and
as
such
she
would
instruct
her
uncle
to
use
it
then
she
allowed
her
imagination
to
revel
in
thoughts
of
rufford
hall
of
the
rufford
house
in
town
and
a
final
end
to
all
those
weary
labours
which
she
would
thus
have
brought
to
so
glorious
a
termination
chapter
xiii
lord
rufford
wants
to
see
a
horse
lord
rufford
had
been
quite
right
about
the
duchess
arabella
had
only
taken
off
her
hat
and
was
drinking
her
tea
when
the
duchess
came
up
to
her
lord
rufford
says
that
you
were
too
tired
to
come
in
said
the
duchess
i
am
tired
aunt
very
tired
but
there
is
nothing
the
matter
with
me
we
had
to
ride
ever
so
far
coming
home
and
it
was
that
knocked
me
up
it
was
very
bad
your
coming
home
with
him
in
a
postchaise
arabella
why
was
it
bad
aunt
i
thought
it
very
nice
my
dear
it
should
have
been
done
you
ought
to
have
known
that
i
certainly
would
have
had
you
here
had
i
thought
that
there
would
be
anything
of
the
kind
it
is
going
to
be
all
right
said
arabella
laughing
according
to
her
grace
view
of
things
it
was
not
and
could
not
be
made
all
right
it
would
not
have
been
all
right
were
the
girl
to
become
lady
rufford
the
scandal
or
loud
reproach
due
to
evil
doings
may
be
silenced
by
subsequent
conduct
the
merited
punishment
may
not
come
visibly
but
nothing
happening
after
could
make
it
right
that
a
young
lady
should
come
home
from
hunting
in
a
postchaise
alone
with
a
young
unmarried
man
when
the
duchess
first
heard
it
she
thought
what
would
have
been
her
feelings
if
such
a
thing
had
been
suggested
in
reference
to
one
of
her
own
daughters
lord
rufford
had
come
to
her
in
the
and
had
told
her
the
story
in
a
quiet
pleasant
manner
merely
saying
that
miss
trefoil
was
too
much
fatigued
to
show
herself
at
the
present
moment
she
had
thought
from
his
manner
that
her
niece
story
had
been
true
there
was
a
cordiality
and
apparent
earnestness
as
to
the
girl
comfort
which
seemed
to
be
compatible
with
the
story
but
still
she
could
hardly
understand
that
lord
rufford
should
wish
to
have
it
known
that
he
travelled
about
the
country
in
such
a
fashion
with
the
girl
he
intended
to
marry
but
if
it
were
true
then
she
must
look
after
her
niece
and
even
if
it
were
not
true
in
which
case
she
would
never
have
the
girl
at
mistletoe
again
yet
she
could
not
ignore
her
presence
in
the
house
it
was
now
the
of
january
lord
rufford
was
to
go
on
the
following
day
and
arabella
on
the
the
invitation
had
not
been
given
so
as
to
stretch
beyond
that
if
it
could
be
at
once
decided
declared
by
lord
rufford
to
the
duke
that
the
match
was
to
be
a
match
then
the
invitation
should
be
renewed
arabella
should
be
advised
to
put
off
her
other
friends
and
lord
rufford
should
be
invited
to
come
back
early
in
the
next
month
and
spend
a
week
or
two
in
the
proper
fashion
with
his
future
bride
all
that
had
been
settled
between
the
duke
and
the
duchess
so
much
should
be
done
for
the
sake
of
the
family
but
the
duke
had
not
seen
his
way
to
asking
lord
rufford
any
question
the
duchess
must
now
find
out
the
truth
if
she
could
so
that
if
the
story
were
false
she
might
get
rid
of
the
girl
and
altogether
shake
her
off
from
the
mistletoe
roof
tree
arabella
manner
was
certainly
free
from
any
appearance
of
hesitation
or
fear
i
do
know
about
being
all
right
said
the
duchess
it
can
not
be
right
that
you
should
have
come
home
with
him
alone
in
a
hired
carriage
is
a
hired
carriage
wickeder
than
a
private
one
if
a
carriage
had
been
sent
from
here
for
you
it
would
have
been
different
but
even
then
he
should
not
have
come
with
you
but
he
would
i
sure
and
i
should
have
asked
him
what
the
man
i
engaged
to
marry
may
he
sit
in
a
carriage
with
me
the
duchess
could
not
explain
herself
and
thought
that
she
had
better
drop
that
topic
what
does
he
mean
to
do
now
arabella
what
does
who
mean
aunt
lord
rufford
he
means
to
marry
me
and
he
means
to
go
from
here
to
i
do
quite
understand
the
question
and
what
do
you
mean
to
do
i
mean
to
marry
him
and
i
mean
to
join
mamma
in
london
on
wednesday
i
believe
we
are
to
go
to
the
connop
green
the
next
day
connop
green
is
a
sort
of
cousin
of
mamma
but
they
are
odious
people
who
is
to
see
lord
rufford
however
my
dear
if
you
are
very
tired
i
will
leave
you
now
no
aunt
stay
a
moment
if
you
will
be
so
very
kind
i
am
tired
but
if
i
were
twice
as
tired
i
would
find
strength
to
talk
about
this
if
my
uncle
would
speak
to
lord
rufford
at
once
i
should
take
it
as
the
very
kindest
thing
he
could
do
i
could
not
send
him
to
my
uncle
for
after
all
one
uncle
and
one
father
are
not
the
same
i
could
only
refer
him
to
papa
but
if
the
duke
would
speak
to
him
did
he
renew
his
offer
he
has
done
nothing
else
but
renew
it
ever
since
he
has
been
in
the
carriage
with
me
that
the
plain
truth
he
made
his
offer
at
rufford
he
renewed
it
in
the
wood
yesterday
and
he
repeated
it
over
and
over
again
as
we
came
home
it
may
have
been
very
wrong
but
so
it
was
miss
trefoil
must
have
thought
that
kissing
and
proposing
were
the
same
thing
other
young
ladies
have
perhaps
before
now
made
such
a
mistake
but
this
young
lady
had
had
much
experience
and
should
have
known
better
lord
rufford
had
better
perhaps
speak
to
your
uncle
will
you
tell
him
so
aunt
the
duchess
thought
about
it
for
a
moment
she
certainly
could
not
tell
lord
rufford
to
speak
to
the
duke
without
getting
the
leave
to
tell
him
so
and
then
if
all
this
were
done
and
lord
rufford
were
to
assure
the
duke
that
the
young
lady
had
made
a
mistake
how
derogatory
would
all
that
be
to
the
exalted
quiescence
of
the
house
of
mayfair
she
thoroughly
wished
that
her
niece
were
out
of
the
house
for
though
she
did
believe
the
story
her
belief
was
not
thorough
i
will
speak
to
your
uncle
she
said
and
now
you
had
better
go
to
sleep
and
dear
aunt
pray
excuse
me
at
dinner
i
have
been
so
excited
so
flurried
and
so
fatigued
that
i
fear
i
should
make
a
fool
of
myself
if
i
attempted
to
come
down
i
should
get
into
a
swoon
which
would
be
dreadful
my
maid
shall
bring
me
a
bit
of
something
and
a
glass
of
sherry
and
you
shall
find
me
in
the
when
you
come
out
then
the
duchess
went
and
arabella
was
left
alone
to
take
another
view
of
the
circumstances
of
the
campaign
though
there
were
still
infinite
dangers
yet
she
could
hardly
wish
that
anything
should
be
altered
should
lord
rufford
disown
her
which
she
knew
to
be
quite
possible
there
would
be
a
general
collapse
and
the
world
would
crash
over
her
head
but
she
had
known
when
she
took
this
business
in
hand
that
as
success
would
open
elysium
to
her
so
would
failure
involve
her
in
absolute
ruin
she
was
determined
that
she
would
mar
nothing
now
by
cowardice
and
having
so
resolved
and
having
fortified
herself
with
perhaps
two
glasses
of
sherry
she
went
down
to
the
a
little
before
nine
and
laid
herself
out
upon
a
sofa
till
the
ladies
should
come
in
lord
rufford
had
gone
to
bed
as
was
his
wont
on
such
occasions
with
orders
that
he
should
be
called
to
dress
for
dinner
at
seven
but
as
he
laid
himself
down
he
made
up
his
mind
that
instead
of
sleeping
he
would
give
himself
up
to
thinking
about
arabella
trefoil
the
matter
was
going
beyond
a
joke
and
would
require
some
thinking
he
liked
her
well
enough
but
was
certainly
not
in
love
with
her
i
doubt
whether
men
ever
are
in
love
with
girls
who
throw
themselves
into
their
arms
a
man
love
till
it
has
been
chastened
and
fastened
by
the
feeling
of
duty
which
marriage
brings
with
it
is
instigated
mainly
by
the
difficulty
of
pursuit
it
is
hardly
possible
that
anything
so
sweet
as
that
should
ever
be
mine
and
yet
because
i
am
a
man
and
because
it
is
so
heavenly
sweet
i
will
try
that
is
what
men
say
to
themselves
but
lord
rufford
had
had
no
opportunity
of
saying
that
to
himself
in
regard
to
miss
trefoil
the
thing
had
been
sweet
but
not
heavenly
sweet
and
he
had
never
for
a
moment
doubted
the
possibility
now
at
any
rate
he
would
make
up
his
mind
but
instead
of
doing
so
he
went
to
sleep
and
when
he
got
up
he
was
ten
minutes
late
and
was
forced
as
he
dressed
himself
to
think
of
the
duke
dinner
instead
of
arabella
trefoil
the
duchess
before
dinner
submitted
herself
and
all
her
troubles
at
great
length
to
the
duke
but
the
duke
could
give
her
no
substantial
comfort
of
course
it
had
all
been
wrong
he
supposed
that
they
ought
not
to
have
been
found
walking
together
in
the
dark
on
sunday
afternoon
the
hunting
should
not
have
been
arranged
without
sanction
and
the
return
home
in
the
hired
carriage
had
no
doubt
been
highly
improper
but
what
could
he
do
if
the
marriage
came
off
it
would
be
all
well
if
not
this
niece
must
not
be
invited
to
mistletoe
again
as
to
speaking
to
lord
rufford
he
did
not
quite
see
how
he
was
to
set
about
it
his
own
girls
had
been
married
in
so
very
different
a
fashion
he
could
imagine
nothing
so
disagreeable
as
to
have
to
ask
a
gentleman
his
intentions
parental
duty
might
make
it
necessary
when
a
daughter
had
not
known
how
to
keep
her
own
position
intact
but
here
there
was
no
parental
duty
if
lord
rufford
would
speak
to
him
then
indeed
there
would
be
no
difficulty
at
last
he
told
his
wife
that
if
she
could
find
an
opportunity
of
suggesting
to
the
young
lord
that
he
might
perhaps
say
a
word
to
the
young
uncle
without
impropriety
if
she
could
do
this
in
a
light
easy
way
so
as
to
run
no
peril
of
a
scene
she
might
do
so
when
the
two
duchesses
and
all
the
other
ladies
came
out
into
the
arabella
was
found
upon
the
sofa
of
course
she
became
the
centre
of
a
little
interest
for
a
few
minutes
and
the
more
so
as
her
aunt
went
up
to
her
and
made
some
inquiries
had
she
had
any
dinner
was
she
less
fatigued
the
fact
of
the
improper
return
home
in
the
postchaise
had
become
generally
known
and
there
were
some
there
who
would
have
turned
a
very
cold
shoulder
to
arabella
had
not
her
aunt
noticed
her
perhaps
there
were
some
who
had
envied
her
jack
and
lord
rufford
admiration
and
even
the
postchaise
but
as
long
as
her
aunt
countenanced
her
it
was
not
likely
that
any
one
at
mistletoe
would
be
unkind
to
her
the
duchess
of
omnium
did
indeed
remark
to
lady
chiltern
that
she
remembered
something
of
the
same
kind
happening
to
the
same
girl
soon
after
her
own
marriage
as
the
duchess
had
now
been
married
a
great
many
years
this
was
unkind
but
it
was
known
that
when
the
duchess
of
omnium
did
dislike
any
one
she
never
scrupled
to
show
it
lord
rufford
is
about
the
silliest
man
of
his
day
she
said
afterwards
to
the
same
lady
but
there
is
one
thing
which
i
do
not
think
even
he
is
silly
enough
to
do
it
was
nearly
ten
when
the
gentlemen
came
into
the
room
and
then
it
was
that
the
duchess
arabella
aunt
must
find
the
opportunity
of
giving
lord
rufford
the
hint
of
which
the
duke
had
spoken
he
was
to
leave
mistletoe
on
the
morrow
and
might
not
improbably
do
so
early
of
all
women
she
was
the
steadiest
the
most
tranquil
the
least
abrupt
in
her
movements
she
could
not
pounce
upon
a
man
and
nail
him
down
and
say
what
she
had
to
say
let
him
be
as
unwilling
as
he
might
to
hear
it
at
last
however
seeing
lord
rufford
standing
alone
he
had
then
just
left
the
sofa
on
which
arabella
was
still
lying
without
any
apparent
effort
she
made
her
way
up
to
his
side
you
had
rather
a
long
day
she
said
not
particularly
duchess
you
had
to
come
home
so
far
about
the
average
distance
did
you
think
it
a
hard
day
maurice
then
he
called
to
his
aid
a
certain
lord
maurice
john
a
and
old
friend
of
the
trefoil
family
who
gave
the
duchess
a
very
clear
account
of
all
the
performance
during
which
lord
rufford
fell
into
an
interesting
conversation
with
mulready
the
wife
of
the
neighbouring
bishop
after
that
the
duchess
made
another
attempt
lord
rufford
she
said
we
should
be
so
glad
if
you
would
come
back
to
us
the
first
week
in
february
the
prices
will
be
here
and
the
mackenzies
and
i
am
pledged
to
stay
with
my
sister
till
the
fifth
and
on
the
sixth
surbiton
and
all
his
lot
come
to
me
battersby
is
it
not
the
sixth
that
you
and
surbiton
come
to
rufford
i
rather
think
it
is
said
battersby
i
wish
it
were
possible
i
like
mistletoe
so
much
it
so
central
very
well
for
hunting
is
it
not
lord
rufford
but
that
horrid
captain
battersby
did
not
go
out
of
the
way
i
wonder
whether
lady
chiltern
would
do
me
a
favour
said
lord
rufford
stepping
across
the
room
in
search
of
that
lady
he
might
be
foolish
but
when
the
duchess
of
omnium
declared
him
to
be
the
silliest
man
of
the
day
i
think
she
used
a
wrong
epithet
the
duchess
was
very
patient
and
intended
to
try
again
but
on
that
evening
she
got
no
opportunity
captain
battersby
was
lord
rufford
particular
friend
on
this
occasion
and
had
come
over
with
him
from
surbiton
house
bat
he
said
as
they
were
sitting
close
to
each
other
in
the
that
night
i
mean
to
make
an
early
start
what
to
get
to
surbiton
i
got
something
to
do
on
the
way
i
want
to
look
at
a
horse
at
stamford
i
be
off
with
you
no
do
do
that
i
go
in
my
own
cart
i
make
my
man
get
hold
of
my
groom
and
manage
it
somehow
i
can
leave
my
things
and
you
can
bring
them
only
say
that
i
was
obliged
to
go
i
understand
heard
something
you
know
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
make
my
apologies
to
the
duchess
in
point
of
fact
i
must
be
in
stamford
at
ten
i
manage
it
all
said
captain
battersby
who
made
a
very
shrewd
guess
at
the
cause
which
drew
his
friend
to
such
an
uncomfortable
proceeding
after
that
lord
rufford
went
to
his
room
and
gave
a
good
deal
of
trouble
that
night
to
some
of
the
servants
in
reference
to
the
steps
which
would
be
necessary
to
take
him
out
of
harm
way
before
the
duchess
would
be
up
on
the
morrow
arabella
when
she
heard
of
the
man
departure
on
the
following
morning
which
she
luckily
did
from
her
own
maid
was
for
some
time
overwhelmed
by
it
of
course
the
man
was
running
away
from
her
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
it
she
had
watched
him
narrowly
on
the
previous
evening
and
had
seen
that
her
aunt
had
tried
in
vain
to
speak
to
him
but
she
did
not
on
that
account
give
up
the
game
at
any
rate
they
had
not
found
her
out
at
mistletoe
that
was
something
of
course
it
would
have
been
infinitely
better
for
her
could
he
have
been
absolutely
caught
and
nailed
down
before
he
left
the
house
but
that
was
perhaps
more
than
she
had
a
right
to
expect
she
could
still
pursue
him
still
write
to
him
and
at
last
if
necessary
force
her
father
to
do
so
but
she
must
trust
now
chiefly
to
her
own
correspondence
he
told
me
aunt
the
last
thing
last
night
that
he
was
going
she
said
why
did
you
not
mention
it
i
thought
he
would
have
told
you
i
saw
him
speaking
to
you
he
had
received
some
telegram
about
a
horse
he
the
most
flighty
man
in
the
world
about
such
things
i
am
to
write
to
him
before
i
leave
this
then
the
duchess
did
not
believe
a
word
of
the
engagement
she
felt
at
any
rate
certain
that
if
there
was
an
engagement
lord
rufford
did
not
mean
to
keep
it
chapter
xiv
the
senator
is
badly
treated
while
these
great
efforts
were
being
made
by
arabella
trefoil
at
mistletoe
john
morton
was
vacillating
in
an
unhappy
mood
between
london
and
bragton
it
may
be
remembered
that
an
offer
was
made
to
him
as
to
the
purchase
of
chowton
farm
at
that
time
the
mistletoe
party
was
broken
up
and
miss
trefoil
was
staying
with
her
mother
at
the
connop
greens
by
the
morning
post
on
the
next
day
he
received
a
note
from
the
senator
in
which
gotobed
stated
that
business
required
his
presence
at
dillsborough
and
suggested
that
he
should
again
become
a
guest
at
bragton
for
a
few
days
morton
was
so
sick
of
his
own
company
and
so
tired
of
thinking
of
his
own
affairs
that
he
was
almost
glad
to
welcome
the
senator
at
any
rate
he
had
no
means
of
escaping
and
the
senator
came
the
two
men
were
alone
at
the
house
and
the
senator
was
full
of
his
own
wrongs
as
well
as
those
of
englishmen
in
general
bearside
had
written
to
him
very
cautiously
but
pressing
for
an
immediate
remittance
of
and
explaining
that
the
great
case
could
not
be
carried
on
without
that
sum
of
money
this
might
have
been
very
well
as
being
open
to
the
idea
that
the
senator
had
the
option
of
either
paying
the
money
or
of
allowing
the
great
case
to
be
abandoned
but
that
the
attorney
in
the
last
paragraph
of
his
letter
intimated
that
the
senator
would
be
of
course
aware
that
he
was
liable
for
the
whole
cost
of
the
action
be
it
what
it
might
he
had
asked
a
legal
friend
in
london
his
opinion
and
the
legal
friend
had
seemed
to
think
that
perhaps
he
was
liable
what
orders
he
had
given
to
bearside
he
had
given
without
any
witness
and
at
any
rate
had
already
paid
a
certain
sum
the
legal
friend
when
he
heard
all
that
gotobed
was
able
to
tell
him
about
goarly
had
advised
the
senator
to
settle
with
bearside
taking
a
due
receipt
and
having
some
person
with
him
when
he
did
so
the
legal
friend
had
thought
that
a
small
sum
of
money
would
suffice
he
went
so
far
as
to
suggest
said
the
senator
with
indignant
energy
that
if
i
contested
my
liability
to
the
man
charges
the
matter
would
go
against
me
because
i
had
interfered
in
such
a
case
on
the
unpopular
side
i
should
think
that
in
this
great
country
i
should
find
justice
administered
on
other
terms
than
that
morton
attempted
to
explain
to
him
that
his
legal
friend
had
not
been
administering
justice
but
only
giving
advice
he
had
so
morton
told
him
undoubtedly
taken
up
the
case
of
one
blackguard
and
in
urging
it
had
paid
his
money
to
another
he
had
done
so
as
a
foreigner
loudly
proclaiming
as
his
reason
for
such
action
that
the
man
he
supported
would
be
unfairly
treated
unless
he
gave
his
assistance
of
course
he
could
not
expect
sympathy
i
want
no
sympathy
said
the
senator
i
only
want
justice
then
the
two
gentlemen
had
become
a
little
angry
with
each
other
morton
was
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
have
been
aggressive
on
such
a
matter
but
with
the
senator
it
was
necessary
either
to
be
prostrate
or
to
fight
but
with
gotobed
such
fighting
never
produced
ill
blood
it
was
the
condition
of
his
life
and
it
must
be
supposed
that
he
liked
it
on
the
next
morning
he
did
not
scruple
to
ask
his
host
advice
as
to
what
he
had
better
do
and
they
agreed
to
walk
across
to
house
and
to
ascertain
from
the
man
himself
what
he
thought
or
might
have
to
say
about
his
own
case
on
their
way
they
passed
up
the
road
leading
to
chowton
farm
and
at
the
gate
leading
into
the
garden
they
found
larry
twentyman
standing
morton
shook
hands
with
the
young
farmer
and
introduced
the
senator
larry
was
still
though
he
endeavoured
to
shake
off
his
sorrows
and
to
appear
to
be
gay
i
never
see
much
of
the
man
he
said
when
they
told
him
that
they
were
going
across
to
call
upon
his
neighbour
and
i
do
know
that
i
want
to
he
does
seem
to
have
much
friendship
among
you
all
said
the
senator
quite
as
much
as
he
deserves
gotobed
replied
larry
the
senator
name
had
lately
become
familiar
as
a
household
word
in
dillsborough
and
was
to
tell
the
truth
odious
to
such
men
as
larry
twentyman
he
a
thundering
rascal
and
the
only
place
fit
for
him
in
the
county
is
rufford
gaol
he
like
to
be
there
soon
i
think
that
what
provokes
me
said
the
senator
you
think
he
a
rascal
mister
i
do
and
because
you
take
upon
yourself
to
think
so
you
send
him
to
rufford
gaol
there
was
one
gentleman
somewhere
about
here
told
me
he
ought
to
be
hung
and
because
i
would
not
agree
with
him
he
got
up
and
walked
away
from
me
at
table
carrying
his
provisions
with
him
another
man
in
the
next
field
to
this
insulted
me
because
i
said
i
was
going
to
see
goarly
the
clergyman
in
dillsborough
and
the
hotelkeepers
were
just
as
hard
upon
me
but
you
see
mister
that
what
we
want
to
find
out
is
whether
goarly
or
the
lord
has
the
right
of
it
in
this
particular
case
i
know
which
has
the
right
without
any
more
finding
out
said
larry
the
shortest
way
to
his
house
is
by
the
ride
through
the
wood
morton
it
takes
you
out
on
his
land
on
the
other
side
but
i
do
think
you
find
him
there
one
of
my
men
told
me
that
he
had
made
himself
scarce
then
he
added
as
the
two
were
going
on
i
should
like
to
have
just
a
word
with
you
morton
been
thinking
of
what
you
said
and
i
know
it
was
kind
i
take
a
month
over
it
i
wo
talk
of
selling
chowton
till
the
end
of
february
but
if
i
feel
about
it
then
as
i
do
now
i
ca
stay
that
right
twentyman
and
work
hard
like
a
man
through
the
month
go
out
hunting
and
do
allow
yourself
a
moment
for
moping
i
will
said
larry
as
he
retreated
to
the
house
and
then
he
gave
directions
that
his
horse
might
be
ready
for
the
morrow
they
went
in
through
the
wood
and
the
senator
pointed
out
the
spot
at
which
bean
the
gamekeeper
had
been
so
insolent
to
him
he
could
not
understand
he
said
why
he
should
be
treated
so
roughly
as
these
men
must
be
aware
that
he
had
nothing
to
gain
himself
if
i
were
to
go
into
mickewa
said
morton
and
interfere
there
with
the
peculiarities
of
the
people
as
you
have
done
here
it
my
belief
that
they
have
had
the
eyes
out
of
my
head
long
before
this
that
only
shows
that
you
do
know
mickewa
said
the
senator
its
people
are
the
most
population
on
the
face
of
the
earth
they
passed
through
the
wood
and
a
couple
of
fields
brought
them
to
goarly
house
as
they
approached
it
by
the
back
the
only
live
thing
they
saw
was
the
old
goose
which
had
been
so
cruelly
deprived
of
her
companions
and
progeny
the
goose
was
waddling
round
the
dirty
pool
and
there
were
to
be
seen
sundry
ugly
signs
of
a
poor
habitation
but
it
was
not
till
they
had
knocked
at
the
window
as
well
as
the
door
that
goarly
showed
herself
she
remembered
the
senator
at
once
and
curtseyed
to
him
and
when
morton
introduced
himself
she
curtseyed
again
to
the
squire
of
bragton
when
goarly
was
asked
for
she
shook
her
head
and
declared
that
she
knew
nothing
about
him
he
had
been
gone
she
said
for
the
last
week
and
had
left
no
word
as
to
whither
he
was
going
nor
had
he
told
her
why
has
he
given
up
his
action
against
lord
rufford
asked
the
senator
indeed
then
sir
i
ca
tell
you
a
word
about
it
i
been
told
that
he
has
taken
lord
rufford
money
he
ai
taken
no
money
as
i
seed
sir
i
wish
he
had
for
money
sore
wanted
here
and
if
the
has
a
mind
to
be
then
she
intimated
her
own
readiness
to
take
any
contribution
to
the
good
cause
which
the
senator
might
be
willing
to
make
at
that
moment
but
the
senator
buttoned
up
his
breeches
pockets
with
stern
resolution
though
he
still
believed
lord
rufford
to
be
altogether
wrong
he
was
beginning
to
think
that
the
goarlys
were
not
worthy
his
benevolence
as
she
came
to
the
door
with
them
and
accompanied
them
a
few
yards
across
the
field
she
again
told
the
tragic
tale
of
her
goose
but
the
senator
had
not
another
word
to
say
to
her
on
that
same
day
morton
drove
gotobed
into
dillsborough
and
consented
to
go
with
him
to
bearside
office
they
found
the
attorney
at
home
and
before
anything
was
said
as
to
payment
they
heard
his
account
of
the
action
if
goarly
had
consented
to
take
any
money
from
lord
rufford
he
knew
nothing
about
it
as
far
as
he
was
aware
the
action
was
going
on
ever
so
many
witnesses
must
be
brought
from
a
distance
who
had
seen
the
crop
standing
and
who
would
have
no
bias
against
the
owner
as
would
be
the
case
with
neighbours
such
as
lawrence
twentyman
of
course
it
was
not
easy
to
oppose
such
a
man
as
lord
rufford
and
a
little
money
must
be
spent
indeed
such
he
said
was
his
interest
in
the
case
that
he
had
already
gone
further
than
he
ought
to
have
done
out
of
his
own
pocket
of
course
they
would
be
successful
that
is
if
the
matter
were
carried
on
with
spirit
and
then
the
money
would
all
come
back
again
but
just
at
present
a
little
money
must
be
spent
i
do
mean
to
spend
it
said
the
senator
i
hope
you
wo
stick
to
that
mr
gotobed
but
i
shall
sir
i
understand
from
your
letter
that
you
look
to
me
for
funds
certainly
i
do
gotobed
because
you
told
me
to
do
so
i
told
you
nothing
of
the
kind
mr
bearside
you
paid
me
on
account
mr
gotobed
i
paid
you
certainly
and
told
me
that
more
should
be
coming
as
it
was
wanted
do
you
think
i
should
have
gone
on
for
such
a
man
as
goarly
a
fellow
without
a
shilling
unless
he
had
some
one
like
you
to
back
him
it
is
likely
now
morton
i
appeal
to
you
i
do
suppose
that
my
friend
has
made
himself
liable
for
your
bill
because
he
paid
you
with
the
view
of
assisting
goarly
said
morton
but
he
said
that
he
meant
to
go
on
morton
he
said
that
plain
and
i
can
swear
it
now
gotobed
you
just
say
out
like
an
honest
man
whether
you
did
give
me
to
understand
that
you
meant
to
go
on
i
never
employed
you
or
made
myself
responsible
for
your
bill
you
authorized
me
distinctly
most
distinctly
and
i
shall
stick
to
it
when
a
gentleman
comes
to
a
lawyer
office
and
pays
his
money
and
tells
that
lawyer
as
how
he
means
to
see
the
case
out
explaining
his
reasons
as
you
did
when
you
said
all
that
against
the
landlords
and
squires
and
nobility
of
this
here
country
why
then
that
lawyer
has
a
right
to
think
that
that
gentleman
is
his
mark
i
thought
you
were
employed
by
scrobby
said
morton
who
had
heard
much
of
the
story
by
this
time
then
morton
i
must
make
bold
to
say
that
you
have
heard
wrong
i
know
nothing
of
scrobby
and
do
want
there
ai
nothing
about
the
poisoning
of
that
fox
in
this
case
of
ours
scrobby
and
goarly
may
have
done
that
or
scrobby
and
goarly
may
be
as
innocent
as
two
babes
unborn
for
aught
i
know
or
care
excuse
me
morton
but
i
have
to
be
on
my
p
and
q
i
see
this
is
a
case
for
trespass
and
damage
against
lord
rufford
in
which
we
ask
for
an
acre
of
course
there
is
expenses
there
my
own
time
i
ai
to
be
kept
here
talking
to
you
two
gentlemen
for
nothing
i
suppose
well
this
gentleman
comes
to
me
and
pays
me
to
go
on
i
could
have
gone
on
without
something
the
gentleman
saw
that
plain
enough
and
he
told
me
he
see
me
through
the
rest
of
it
i
said
nothing
of
the
kind
sir
very
well
then
we
must
put
it
to
a
jury
may
i
make
bold
to
ask
whether
you
are
going
out
of
the
country
all
at
once
i
shall
be
here
for
the
next
two
months
at
least
happy
to
hear
it
sir
and
have
no
doubt
it
will
all
be
settled
before
that
time
amiable
or
otherwise
but
as
i
am
money
out
of
pocket
i
did
hope
you
would
have
paid
me
something
on
account
then
gotobed
made
his
offer
informing
bearside
that
he
had
brought
his
friend
morton
with
him
in
order
that
there
might
be
a
witness
i
could
see
that
sir
with
half
an
eye
said
the
attorney
unabashed
he
was
willing
to
pay
bearside
a
further
sum
of
immediately
to
be
quit
of
the
affair
not
because
he
thought
that
any
such
sum
was
due
but
because
he
wished
to
free
himself
from
further
trouble
in
the
matter
bearside
hinted
in
a
very
cavalier
way
that
might
be
thought
of
a
further
payment
of
would
cover
the
money
he
was
out
of
pocket
but
this
proposition
gotobed
indignantly
refused
and
then
left
the
office
with
his
friend
wherever
there
are
lawyers
there
will
be
rogues
said
the
senator
as
soon
as
he
found
himself
in
the
street
it
is
a
noble
profession
that
of
the
law
the
finest
perhaps
that
the
work
of
the
world
affords
but
it
gives
scope
and
temptation
for
roguery
i
do
not
think
however
that
you
would
find
anything
in
america
so
bad
as
that
why
did
you
go
to
him
without
asking
any
questions
of
whom
was
i
to
ask
questions
when
i
took
up
goarly
case
he
had
already
put
it
into
this
man
hands
i
am
sorry
you
should
be
troubled
gotobed
but
upon
my
word
i
can
not
say
but
what
it
serves
you
right
that
is
because
you
are
offended
with
me
i
endeavoured
to
protect
a
poor
man
against
a
rich
man
and
that
in
this
country
is
cause
of
offence
after
leaving
the
attorney
office
they
called
on
mainwaring
the
rector
and
found
that
he
knew
or
professed
to
know
a
great
deal
more
about
goarly
than
they
had
learned
from
bearside
according
to
his
story
nickem
who
was
clerk
to
masters
had
goarly
in
safe
keeping
somewhere
the
rector
indeed
was
acquainted
with
all
the
details
scrobby
had
purchased
the
red
herrings
and
strychnine
and
had
employed
goarly
to
walk
over
by
night
to
rufford
and
fetch
them
the
poison
at
that
time
had
been
duly
packed
in
the
herrings
goarly
had
done
this
and
had
at
scrobby
instigation
laid
the
bait
down
in
dillsborough
wood
nickem
was
now
at
work
trying
to
learn
where
scrobby
had
purchased
the
poison
as
it
was
feared
that
evidence
alone
would
not
suffice
to
convict
the
man
but
if
the
strychnine
could
be
traced
and
the
herrings
then
there
would
be
almost
a
certainty
of
punishing
scrobby
and
what
about
goarly
asked
the
senator
he
would
escape
of
course
said
the
rector
he
would
get
a
little
money
and
after
such
an
experience
would
probably
become
a
good
friend
to
and
quite
a
respectable
man
the
rector
did
not
guarantee
this
but
seemed
to
think
that
there
would
at
any
rate
be
promise
of
improved
conduct
the
place
ought
to
be
too
hot
to
hold
him
exclaimed
the
senator
indignantly
the
rector
seemed
to
think
it
possible
that
he
might
find
it
uncomfortable
at
first
in
which
case
he
would
sell
the
land
at
a
good
price
to
lord
rufford
and
every
one
concerned
would
have
been
benefited
by
the
transaction
except
scrobby
for
whom
no
one
would
feel
any
pity
the
two
gentlemen
then
promised
to
come
and
dine
with
the
rector
on
the
following
day
he
feared
he
said
that
he
could
not
make
up
a
party
as
there
was
he
declared
nobody
in
dillsborough
i
never
knew
such
a
place
said
the
rector
except
old
nupper
who
is
there
masters
is
a
very
decent
fellow
himself
but
he
has
got
out
of
that
kind
of
thing
and
you
ca
ask
a
man
without
asking
his
wife
as
for
clergymen
i
sick
of
dining
with
my
own
cloth
and
discussing
the
troubles
of
sermons
there
never
was
such
a
place
as
dillsborough
then
he
whispered
a
word
to
the
squire
was
the
squire
unwilling
to
meet
his
cousin
reginald
morton
things
were
said
and
people
never
knew
what
was
true
and
what
was
false
then
john
morton
declared
that
he
would
be
very
happy
to
meet
his
cousin
chapter
xv
mainwaring
little
dinner
the
company
at
the
rector
house
consisted
of
the
senator
the
two
mortons
surtees
the
curate
and
old
doctor
nupper
mainwaring
was
not
well
enough
to
appear
and
the
rector
therefore
was
able
to
indulge
himself
in
what
he
called
a
bachelor
party
as
a
rule
he
disliked
clergymen
but
at
the
last
had
been
driven
to
invite
his
curate
because
he
thought
six
a
better
number
than
five
for
joviality
he
began
by
asking
questions
as
to
the
trefoils
which
were
not
very
fortunate
of
course
he
had
heard
that
morton
was
to
marry
arabella
trefoil
and
though
he
made
no
direct
allusion
to
the
fact
as
reginald
had
done
he
spoke
in
that
bland
eulogistic
tone
which
clearly
showed
his
purpose
they
went
with
you
to
lord
rufford
i
was
told
yes
they
did
and
now
they
have
left
the
neighbourhood
a
very
clever
young
lady
miss
trefoil
and
so
is
her
mother
a
very
clever
woman
the
senator
to
whom
a
sort
of
appeal
was
made
nodded
his
assent
lord
augustus
i
believe
is
a
brother
of
the
duke
of
mayfair
yes
he
is
said
morton
i
am
afraid
we
are
going
to
have
frost
again
then
reginald
morton
was
sure
that
the
marriage
would
never
take
place
the
trefoils
are
a
very
distinguished
family
continued
the
rector
i
remember
the
present
duke
father
when
he
was
in
the
cabinet
and
knew
this
man
almost
intimately
when
we
were
at
christchurch
together
i
do
think
this
duke
ever
took
a
prominent
part
in
politics
i
do
know
that
he
ever
did
said
morton
dear
dear
how
tipsy
he
was
once
driving
back
to
oxford
with
me
in
a
gig
but
he
has
the
reputation
of
being
one
of
the
best
landlords
in
the
country
now
i
wonder
what
it
is
that
gives
a
man
the
reputation
of
being
a
good
landlord
is
it
foxes
asked
the
senator
the
rector
acknowledged
with
a
smile
that
foxes
helped
or
does
it
mean
that
he
lets
his
land
below
the
value
if
so
he
certainly
does
more
harm
than
good
though
he
may
like
the
popularity
which
he
is
rich
enough
to
buy
it
means
that
he
does
not
exact
more
than
his
due
said
the
rector
indiscreetly
when
i
hear
a
man
so
highly
praised
for
common
honesty
i
am
of
course
led
to
suppose
that
dishonesty
in
his
particular
trade
is
the
common
rule
the
body
of
english
landlords
must
be
exorbitant
tyrants
when
one
among
them
is
so
highly
eulogised
for
taking
no
more
than
his
own
luckily
at
that
moment
dinner
was
announced
and
the
exceptional
character
of
the
duke
of
mayfair
was
allowed
to
drop
mainwaring
dinner
was
very
good
and
his
wines
were
excellent
a
fact
of
which
mainwaring
himself
was
much
better
aware
than
any
of
his
guests
there
is
a
difficulty
in
the
giving
of
dinners
of
which
mainwaring
and
some
other
hosts
have
become
painfully
aware
what
service
do
you
do
to
any
one
in
pouring
your
best
claret
down
his
throat
when
he
knows
no
difference
between
that
and
a
much
more
humble
vintage
your
best
claret
which
you
feel
so
sure
you
can
not
replace
why
import
ducks
for
appetites
which
would
be
quite
as
well
satisfied
with
those
out
of
the
next
your
soup
which
has
been
a
care
since
yesterday
your
fish
got
down
with
so
great
trouble
from
bond
street
on
that
very
day
your
saddle
of
mutton
in
selecting
which
you
have
affronted
every
butcher
in
the
neighbourhood
are
all
plainly
thrown
away
and
yet
the
hospitable
hero
who
would
fain
treat
his
friends
as
he
would
be
treated
himself
can
hardly
arrange
his
dinners
according
to
the
palates
of
his
different
guests
nor
will
he
like
when
strangers
sit
at
his
board
to
put
nothing
better
on
his
table
than
that
cheaper
wine
with
which
needful
economy
induces
him
to
solace
himself
when
alone
i
i
who
write
this
have
myself
seen
an
honoured
guest
deluge
with
the
pump
my
ah
so
hardly
earned
most
scarce
and
most
peculiar
vintage
there
is
a
pang
in
such
usage
which
some
will
not
understand
but
which
cut
mainwaring
to
the
very
soul
there
was
not
one
among
them
there
who
appreciated
the
fact
that
the
claret
on
his
dinner
table
was
almost
the
best
that
its
year
had
produced
it
was
impossible
not
to
say
a
word
on
such
a
subject
at
such
a
moment
though
our
rector
was
not
a
man
who
usually
lauded
his
own
viands
i
think
you
will
find
that
claret
what
you
like
gotobed
he
said
it
a
mouton
and
judges
say
that
it
is
good
very
good
indeed
said
the
senator
in
the
states
we
have
got
into
the
way
yet
of
using
dinner
clarets
it
was
as
good
as
a
play
to
see
the
rector
wince
under
the
ignominious
word
your
great
statesman
added
much
to
your
national
comfort
when
he
took
the
duty
off
the
lighter
kinds
of
french
wines
the
rector
could
not
stand
it
he
hated
light
wines
he
hated
cheap
things
in
general
and
he
hated
gladstone
in
particular
nothing
said
he
that
the
statesman
you
speak
of
ever
did
could
make
such
wine
as
that
any
cheaper
i
am
sorry
sir
that
you
do
perceive
the
difference
in
the
matter
of
wine
said
the
senator
i
do
think
that
i
have
happened
to
come
across
anything
so
good
in
this
country
as
our
old
madeiras
but
then
sir
we
have
been
fortunate
in
our
climate
the
english
atmosphere
is
not
one
in
which
wine
seems
to
reach
its
full
perfection
the
rector
heaved
a
deep
sigh
as
he
looked
up
to
the
ceiling
with
his
hands
in
his
he
knew
or
thought
that
he
knew
that
no
one
could
ever
get
a
glass
of
good
wine
in
the
united
states
he
knew
or
thought
that
he
knew
that
the
best
wine
in
the
world
was
brought
to
england
he
knew
or
thought
he
knew
that
in
no
other
country
was
wine
so
well
understood
so
diligently
sought
for
and
so
truly
enjoyed
as
in
england
and
he
imagined
that
it
was
less
understood
and
less
sought
for
and
less
enjoyed
in
the
states
than
in
any
other
country
he
did
not
as
yet
know
the
senator
well
enough
to
fight
with
him
at
his
own
table
and
could
only
groan
and
moan
and
look
up
at
the
ceiling
doctor
nupper
endeavoured
to
take
away
the
sting
by
smacking
his
lips
and
reginald
morton
who
did
not
in
truth
care
a
straw
what
he
drank
was
moved
to
pity
and
declared
the
claret
to
be
very
fine
i
have
nothing
to
say
against
it
said
the
senator
who
was
not
in
the
least
abashed
but
when
the
cloth
was
drawn
for
the
rector
clung
so
lovingly
to
old
habits
that
he
delighted
to
see
his
mahogany
beneath
the
wine
glasses
a
more
serious
subject
of
dispute
arose
suddenly
though
perhaps
hardly
more
disagreeable
the
thing
in
england
said
the
senator
which
i
find
most
difficult
to
understand
is
the
matter
of
what
you
call
church
patronage
if
you
pass
half
an
hour
with
surtees
morning
he
explain
it
all
to
you
said
the
rector
who
did
not
like
that
any
subject
connected
with
his
profession
should
be
mooted
after
dinner
i
should
be
delighted
said
surtees
nothing
would
give
me
more
pleasure
said
the
senator
but
what
i
mean
is
this
the
question
is
of
course
one
of
paramount
importance
no
doubt
it
is
said
the
deluded
rector
it
is
very
necessary
to
get
good
doctors
well
yes
rather
considering
that
all
men
wish
to
live
that
observation
of
course
came
from
doctor
nupper
and
care
is
taken
in
employing
a
lawyer
though
after
my
experience
of
yesterday
not
always
i
should
say
so
much
care
as
is
needful
the
man
who
wants
such
aid
looks
about
him
and
gets
the
best
doctor
he
can
for
his
money
or
the
best
lawyer
but
here
in
england
he
must
take
the
clergyman
provided
for
him
it
would
be
very
much
better
for
him
if
he
did
said
the
rector
a
clergyman
at
any
rate
is
supposed
to
be
appointed
and
that
clergyman
he
must
pay
not
at
all
said
the
rector
the
clergy
are
paid
by
the
wise
provision
of
former
ages
we
will
let
that
pass
for
the
present
said
the
senator
there
he
is
however
he
may
be
paid
how
does
he
get
there
now
it
was
the
fact
that
mainwaring
living
had
been
bought
for
him
with
his
wife
money
a
fact
of
which
gotobed
was
not
aware
but
which
he
would
hardly
have
regarded
had
he
known
it
how
does
he
get
there
in
the
majority
of
cases
the
bishop
puts
him
there
said
surtees
and
how
is
the
bishop
governed
in
his
choice
as
far
as
i
can
learn
the
stipends
are
absurdly
various
one
man
getting
a
year
for
working
like
a
horse
in
a
big
town
and
another
for
living
an
idle
life
in
a
luxurious
country
house
but
the
bishop
of
course
gives
the
bigger
plums
to
the
best
men
how
is
it
then
that
the
big
plums
find
their
way
so
often
to
the
sons
and
and
nephews
of
the
bishops
because
the
bishop
has
looked
after
their
education
and
principles
said
the
rector
and
taught
them
how
to
choose
their
wives
said
the
senator
with
imperturbable
gravity
i
am
not
the
son
of
a
bishop
sir
exclaimed
the
rector
i
wish
you
had
been
sir
if
it
would
have
done
you
any
good
a
general
ca
make
his
son
a
colonel
at
the
age
of
or
an
admiral
his
son
a
first
lieutenant
or
a
judge
his
a
counsellor
nor
can
the
head
of
an
office
promote
his
to
be
a
chief
secretary
it
is
only
a
bishop
can
do
this
i
suppose
because
a
cure
of
souls
is
so
much
less
important
than
the
charge
of
a
ship
or
the
discipline
of
twenty
or
thirty
clerks
the
bishops
do
do
it
said
the
rector
fiercely
then
the
statistics
which
have
been
put
into
my
hands
belie
them
but
how
is
it
with
those
the
bishops
do
appoint
there
seems
to
me
to
be
such
a
complication
of
absurdities
as
to
defy
explanation
i
think
i
could
explain
them
all
said
surtees
mildly
if
you
can
do
so
satisfactorily
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
hear
it
continued
the
senator
who
seemed
in
truth
to
be
glad
to
hear
no
one
but
himself
a
lad
of
learns
his
lessons
so
well
that
he
has
to
be
rewarded
at
his
college
and
a
part
of
his
reward
consists
in
his
having
a
parish
entrusted
to
him
when
he
is
forty
years
old
to
which
he
can
maintain
his
right
whether
he
be
in
any
way
trained
for
such
work
or
no
is
that
true
his
collegiate
education
is
the
best
training
he
can
have
said
the
rector
i
came
across
a
young
fellow
the
other
day
continued
the
senator
in
a
very
nice
house
with
a
year
and
learned
that
he
had
inherited
the
living
because
he
was
his
father
second
son
some
poor
clergyman
had
been
keeping
it
ready
for
him
for
the
last
fifteen
years
and
had
to
turn
out
as
soon
as
this
young
spark
could
be
made
a
clergyman
it
was
his
father
property
said
the
rector
and
the
poor
man
had
had
great
kindness
shown
him
for
those
fifteen
years
exactly
his
father
property
and
this
is
what
you
call
a
cure
of
souls
and
another
man
had
absolutely
had
his
living
bought
for
him
by
his
uncle
just
as
he
might
have
bought
him
a
farm
he
have
bought
him
the
command
of
a
regiment
or
a
small
judgeship
in
those
matters
you
require
capacity
it
is
only
when
you
deal
with
the
church
that
you
throw
to
the
winds
all
ideas
of
fitness
or
or
perhaps
little
dear
you
are
bound
to
come
to
your
places
in
church
and
hear
me
expound
the
word
of
god
because
i
have
paid
a
heavy
sum
of
money
for
the
privilege
of
teaching
you
at
the
moderate
salary
of
a
year
surtees
sat
aghast
with
his
mouth
open
and
knew
not
how
to
say
a
word
doctor
nupper
rubbed
his
red
nose
reginald
morton
attempted
some
suggestion
about
the
wine
which
fell
wretchedly
flat
john
morton
ventured
to
tell
his
friend
that
he
did
not
understand
the
subject
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
be
instructed
said
the
senator
understand
it
said
the
rector
almost
rising
in
his
chair
to
rebuke
the
insolence
of
his
guest
he
understands
nothing
about
it
and
yet
he
ventures
to
fall
foul
with
unmeasured
terms
on
an
establishment
which
has
been
brought
to
its
present
condition
by
the
fostering
care
of
perhaps
the
most
pious
set
of
divines
that
ever
lived
and
which
has
produced
results
with
which
those
of
no
other
church
can
compare
have
i
represented
anything
untruly
asked
the
senator
a
great
deal
sir
only
put
me
right
and
no
man
will
recall
his
words
more
readily
is
it
not
the
case
that
livings
in
the
church
of
england
can
be
bought
and
sold
the
matter
is
one
sir
said
the
rector
which
can
not
be
discussed
in
this
manner
there
are
two
clergymen
present
to
whom
such
language
is
distasteful
as
it
is
also
i
hope
to
the
others
who
are
all
members
of
the
church
of
england
perhaps
you
will
allow
me
to
request
that
the
subject
may
be
changed
after
that
conversation
flagged
and
the
evening
was
by
no
means
joyous
the
rector
certainly
regretted
that
his
claret
should
have
been
expended
on
such
a
man
i
do
think
said
he
when
john
morton
had
taken
the
senator
away
that
in
my
whole
life
before
i
ever
met
such
a
brute
as
that
american
senator
chapter
xvi
persecution
there
was
great
consternation
in
the
attorney
house
after
the
writing
of
the
letter
to
lawrence
twentyman
for
hours
masters
did
not
speak
to
mary
not
at
all
intending
to
let
her
sin
pass
with
such
moderate
punishment
as
that
but
thinking
during
that
period
that
as
she
might
perhaps
induce
larry
to
ignore
the
letter
and
look
upon
it
as
though
it
were
not
written
it
would
be
best
to
say
nothing
till
the
time
should
come
in
which
the
lover
might
again
urge
his
suit
but
when
she
found
on
the
evening
of
the
second
day
that
larry
did
not
come
near
the
place
she
could
control
herself
no
longer
and
accused
her
of
ruining
herself
her
father
and
the
whole
family
that
is
very
unfair
mamma
mary
said
i
have
done
nothing
i
have
only
not
done
that
which
nobody
had
a
right
to
ask
me
to
do
right
indeed
and
who
are
you
with
your
rights
a
decent
young
man
with
five
or
six
hundred
a
year
has
no
right
to
ask
you
to
be
his
wife
all
this
comes
of
you
staying
with
an
old
woman
with
a
handle
to
her
name
it
was
in
vain
that
mary
endeavoured
to
explain
that
she
had
not
alluded
to
larry
when
she
declared
that
no
one
had
a
right
to
ask
her
to
do
it
she
had
she
said
always
thanked
him
for
his
good
opinion
of
her
and
had
spoken
well
of
him
whenever
his
name
was
mentioned
but
it
was
a
matter
on
which
a
young
woman
was
entitled
to
judge
for
herself
and
no
one
had
a
right
to
scold
her
because
she
could
not
love
him
masters
hated
such
arguments
despised
this
rodomontade
about
love
and
would
have
crushed
the
girl
into
obedience
could
it
have
been
possible
you
are
an
idiot
she
said
an
ungrateful
idiot
and
unless
you
think
better
of
it
you
repent
your
folly
to
your
dying
day
who
do
you
think
is
to
come
running
after
a
moping
slut
like
you
then
mary
gathered
herself
up
and
left
the
room
feeling
that
she
could
not
live
in
the
house
if
she
were
to
be
called
a
slut
soon
after
this
larry
came
to
the
attorney
and
got
him
to
come
out
into
the
street
and
to
walk
with
him
round
the
churchyard
it
was
the
spot
in
dillsborough
in
which
they
would
most
certainly
be
left
undisturbed
this
took
place
on
the
day
before
his
proposition
for
the
sale
of
chowton
farm
when
he
got
the
attorney
into
the
churchyard
he
took
out
mary
letter
and
in
speechless
agony
handed
it
to
the
attorney
i
saw
it
before
it
went
said
masters
putting
it
back
with
his
hand
i
suppose
she
means
it
asked
larry
i
ca
say
to
you
but
what
she
does
twentyman
as
far
as
i
know
her
she
is
a
girl
that
would
ever
say
anything
that
she
mean
i
was
sure
of
that
when
i
got
it
and
read
it
it
was
just
as
though
some
one
had
come
behind
me
and
hit
me
over
the
head
with
a
i
could
have
ate
a
morsel
of
breakfast
if
i
knew
i
was
to
see
another
bit
of
food
for
hours
i
knew
you
would
feel
it
larry
feel
it
till
it
came
to
this
i
did
think
of
myself
but
what
i
had
more
strength
it
has
knocked
me
about
till
i
feel
all
over
like
drinking
do
do
that
larry
i
wo
answer
for
myself
what
i
do
a
man
sets
his
heart
on
a
thing
just
on
one
thing
and
has
grit
enough
in
him
to
be
sure
of
himself
that
if
he
can
get
that
nothing
shall
knock
him
over
when
that
thoroughbred
mare
of
mine
slipped
her
foal
who
can
say
i
ever
whimpered
when
i
got
pleuro
among
the
cattle
i
killed
the
lot
of
out
of
hand
and
never
laid
awake
a
night
about
it
but
got
it
so
heavy
this
time
i
ca
stand
it
you
do
think
i
have
any
chance
mr
masters
you
can
try
of
course
you
welcome
to
the
house
but
what
do
you
think
you
must
know
her
girls
do
change
their
minds
but
she
is
like
other
girls
is
she
now
i
come
to
you
because
i
sometimes
think
masters
is
a
little
hard
on
her
masters
is
about
the
best
friend
i
have
there
is
anybody
more
on
my
side
than
she
is
but
i
feel
sure
of
this
mary
will
never
be
drove
i
do
think
she
will
larry
she
got
a
will
of
her
own
as
well
as
another
no
man
alive
ever
had
a
better
daughter
i
sure
of
that
masters
and
no
man
alive
ever
have
a
better
wife
but
she
wo
be
drove
i
might
ask
her
again
you
think
you
certainly
have
my
leave
but
would
it
be
any
good
i
rather
cut
my
throat
and
have
done
with
it
than
go
about
teasing
her
because
her
parents
let
me
come
to
her
then
there
was
a
pause
during
which
they
walked
on
the
attorney
feeling
that
he
had
nothing
more
to
say
what
i
want
to
know
said
larry
is
this
is
there
anybody
else
that
was
just
the
point
on
which
the
attorney
himself
was
perplexed
he
had
asked
mary
that
question
and
her
silence
had
assured
him
that
it
was
so
then
he
had
suggested
to
her
the
name
of
the
only
probable
suitor
that
occurred
to
him
and
she
had
repelled
the
idea
in
a
manner
that
had
convinced
him
at
once
there
was
some
one
but
surtees
was
not
the
man
there
was
some
one
he
was
sure
but
he
had
not
been
able
to
her
on
the
subject
he
had
since
that
cudgelled
his
brain
to
think
who
that
some
one
might
be
but
had
not
succeeded
in
suggesting
a
name
even
to
himself
that
of
reginald
morton
who
hardly
ever
came
to
the
house
and
whom
he
regarded
as
a
silent
severe
unapproachable
man
did
not
come
into
his
mind
among
the
young
ladies
of
dillsborough
reginald
morton
was
never
regarded
as
even
a
possible
lover
and
yet
there
was
assuredly
some
one
if
there
is
any
one
else
i
think
you
ought
to
tell
me
continued
larry
it
is
quite
possible
young
surtees
i
suppose
i
do
not
say
there
is
anybody
but
if
there
be
anybody
i
do
not
think
it
is
surtees
who
else
then
i
can
not
say
larry
i
know
nothing
about
it
but
there
is
some
one
i
do
not
say
so
you
ask
me
and
i
tell
you
all
i
know
again
they
walked
round
the
churchyard
in
silence
and
the
attorney
began
to
be
anxious
that
the
interview
might
be
over
he
hardly
liked
to
be
interrogated
about
the
state
of
his
daughter
heart
and
yet
he
had
felt
himself
bound
to
tell
what
he
knew
to
the
man
who
had
in
all
respects
behaved
well
to
him
when
they
had
returned
for
the
third
or
fourth
time
to
the
gate
by
which
they
had
entered
larry
spoke
again
i
suppose
i
may
as
well
give
it
up
what
can
i
say
you
have
been
fair
enough
masters
and
so
has
she
and
so
has
everybody
i
shall
just
get
away
as
quick
as
i
can
and
go
and
hang
myself
i
feel
above
bothering
her
any
more
when
she
sat
down
to
write
a
letter
like
that
she
must
have
been
in
earnest
she
certainly
was
in
earnest
larry
what
the
use
of
going
on
after
that
only
it
is
so
hard
for
a
fellow
to
feel
that
everything
is
gone
it
is
just
as
though
the
house
was
burnt
down
or
i
was
to
wake
in
the
morning
and
find
that
the
land
did
belong
to
me
not
so
bad
as
that
larry
not
so
bad
masters
then
you
do
know
what
it
is
i
feeling
i
let
his
lordship
or
squire
morton
have
it
all
and
go
in
upon
it
as
a
tenant
at
an
acre
so
that
i
could
take
her
along
with
me
i
would
and
sell
the
horses
and
set
to
and
work
in
my
a
man
could
stand
that
nobody
would
laugh
at
me
then
but
there
an
emptiness
now
here
that
makes
me
sick
all
through
as
though
i
had
got
stomach
left
for
anything
then
poor
larry
put
his
hand
upon
his
heart
and
hid
his
face
upon
the
churchyard
wall
the
attorney
made
some
attempt
to
say
a
kind
word
to
him
and
then
leaving
him
there
slowly
made
his
way
back
to
his
office
we
already
know
what
first
step
larry
took
with
the
intention
of
running
away
from
his
cares
in
the
house
at
dillsborough
things
were
almost
as
bad
as
they
were
with
him
over
and
over
again
masters
told
her
husband
that
it
was
all
his
fault
and
that
if
he
had
torn
the
letter
when
it
was
showed
to
him
everything
would
have
been
right
by
the
end
of
the
two
months
this
he
bore
with
what
equanimity
he
could
shutting
himself
up
very
much
in
his
office
occasionally
escaping
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
of
ease
to
his
friends
at
the
bush
and
eating
his
meals
in
silence
but
when
he
became
aware
that
his
girl
was
being
treated
with
cruelty
that
she
was
never
spoken
to
by
her
stepmother
without
harsh
words
and
that
her
sisters
were
encouraged
to
be
disdainful
to
her
then
his
heart
rose
within
him
and
he
rebelled
he
declared
aloud
that
mary
should
not
be
persecuted
and
if
this
kind
of
thing
were
continued
he
would
defend
his
girl
let
the
consequences
be
what
they
might
what
are
you
going
to
defend
her
against
asked
his
wife
i
wo
have
her
because
she
refuses
to
marry
at
your
bidding
bah
you
know
as
much
how
to
manage
a
girl
as
though
you
were
an
old
maid
yourself
cocker
her
up
and
make
her
think
that
nothing
is
good
enough
for
her
break
her
spirit
and
make
her
come
round
and
teach
her
to
know
what
it
is
to
have
an
honest
man
house
offered
to
her
if
she
do
take
larry
twentyman
she
like
to
have
none
of
her
own
before
long
but
masters
would
not
assent
to
this
plan
of
breaking
his
girl
spirit
and
so
there
was
continual
war
in
the
place
and
every
one
there
was
miserable
mary
herself
was
so
unhappy
that
she
convinced
herself
that
it
was
necessary
that
some
change
should
be
made
then
she
remembered
lady
ushant
offer
of
a
home
and
not
only
the
offer
but
the
old
assurance
that
to
herself
such
an
arrangement
if
possible
would
be
very
comfortable
she
did
not
suggest
to
herself
that
she
would
leave
her
father
home
for
ever
and
always
but
it
might
be
that
an
absence
of
some
months
might
relieve
the
absolute
misery
of
their
present
mode
of
living
the
effect
on
her
father
was
so
sad
that
she
was
almost
driven
to
regret
that
he
should
have
taken
her
own
part
her
stepmother
was
not
a
bad
woman
nor
did
mary
even
now
think
her
to
be
bad
she
was
a
hardworking
painstaking
wife
with
a
good
general
idea
of
justice
in
the
division
of
puddings
and
pies
and
other
material
comforts
of
the
household
she
would
deal
evenly
between
her
own
children
and
her
she
had
not
desired
to
send
mary
away
to
an
inadequate
home
or
with
a
worthless
husband
but
when
the
proper
home
and
the
proper
man
were
there
she
was
prepared
to
use
any
amount
of
hardship
to
secure
these
good
things
to
the
family
generally
this
hardship
mary
could
not
endure
nor
could
mary
father
on
her
behalf
and
therefore
mary
prepared
a
letter
to
lady
ushant
in
which
at
great
length
she
told
her
old
friend
the
whole
story
she
spoke
as
tenderly
as
was
possible
of
all
concerned
but
declared
that
her
stepmother
feelings
on
the
subject
were
so
strong
that
every
one
in
the
house
was
made
wretched
under
these
circumstances
for
her
father
sake
if
only
for
that
she
thought
herself
bound
to
leave
the
house
it
is
quite
impossible
she
said
that
i
should
do
as
they
wish
me
that
is
a
matter
on
which
a
young
woman
must
judge
for
herself
if
you
could
have
me
for
a
few
months
it
would
perhaps
all
pass
by
i
should
not
dare
to
ask
this
but
for
what
you
said
yourself
and
dear
lady
ushant
pray
remember
that
i
do
not
want
to
be
idle
there
are
a
great
many
things
i
can
do
and
though
i
know
that
nothing
can
pay
for
kindness
i
might
perhaps
be
able
not
to
be
a
burden
then
she
added
in
a
postscript
papa
is
everything
that
is
kind
but
then
all
this
makes
him
so
miserable
when
she
had
kept
the
letter
by
her
for
a
day
she
showed
it
to
her
father
and
by
his
consent
it
was
sent
after
much
consultation
it
was
agreed
between
them
that
nothing
should
be
said
about
it
to
masters
till
the
answer
should
come
and
that
should
the
answer
be
favourable
the
plan
should
be
carried
out
in
spite
of
any
domestic
opposition
in
this
letter
mary
told
as
accurately
as
she
could
the
whole
story
of
larry
courtship
and
was
very
clear
in
declaring
that
under
no
possible
circumstances
could
she
encourage
any
hope
but
of
course
she
said
not
a
word
as
to
any
other
man
or
as
to
any
love
on
her
side
have
you
told
her
everything
said
her
father
as
he
closed
the
letter
yes
papa
everything
that
there
is
to
be
told
then
there
arose
within
his
own
bosom
an
immense
desire
to
know
that
secret
so
that
if
possible
he
might
do
something
to
relieve
her
pain
but
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
ask
further
questions
lady
ushant
on
receiving
the
letter
much
doubted
what
she
ought
to
do
she
acknowledged
at
once
mary
right
to
appeal
to
her
and
assured
herself
that
the
girl
presence
would
be
a
comfort
and
a
happiness
to
herself
if
mary
were
quite
alone
in
the
world
lady
ushant
would
have
been
at
once
prepared
to
give
her
a
home
but
she
doubted
as
to
the
propriety
of
taking
the
girl
from
her
own
family
she
doubted
even
whether
it
would
not
be
better
that
mary
should
be
left
within
the
influence
of
larry
twentyman
charms
a
settlement
an
income
and
assured
comforts
for
life
are
very
serious
things
to
all
people
who
have
reached
lady
ushant
age
and
then
she
had
a
doubt
within
her
own
mind
whether
mary
might
not
be
debarred
from
accepting
this
young
man
by
some
unfortunate
preference
for
reginald
morton
she
had
seen
them
together
and
had
suspected
something
of
the
truth
before
it
had
glimmered
before
the
eyes
of
any
one
in
dillsborough
had
reginald
been
so
inclined
lady
ushant
would
have
been
very
glad
to
see
him
marry
mary
masters
for
both
their
sakes
she
would
have
preferred
such
a
match
to
one
with
the
owner
of
chowton
farm
but
she
did
not
think
that
reginald
himself
was
that
way
minded
and
she
fancied
that
poor
mary
might
be
throwing
away
her
prosperity
in
life
were
she
to
wait
for
reginald
love
larry
twentyman
was
at
any
rate
sure
and
perhaps
it
might
be
unwise
to
separate
the
girl
from
her
lover
in
her
doubt
she
determined
to
refer
the
case
to
reginald
himself
and
instead
of
writing
to
mary
she
wrote
to
him
she
did
not
send
him
mary
letter
which
would
she
felt
have
been
a
breach
of
faith
nor
did
she
mention
the
name
of
larry
twentyman
but
she
told
him
that
mary
had
proposed
to
come
to
cheltenham
for
a
long
visit
because
there
were
disturbances
at
home
which
disturbances
had
arisen
from
her
rejection
of
a
certain
suitor
lady
ushant
said
a
great
deal
as
to
the
inexpediency
of
fostering
family
quarrels
and
suggested
that
mary
might
perhaps
have
been
a
little
impetuous
the
presence
of
this
lover
could
hardly
do
her
much
injury
these
were
not
days
in
which
young
women
were
forced
to
marry
men
what
did
he
reginald
morton
think
about
it
he
was
to
remember
that
as
far
as
she
herself
was
concerned
she
dearly
loved
mary
masters
and
would
be
delighted
to
have
her
at
cheltenham
and
so
remembering
he
was
to
see
the
attorney
and
mary
herself
and
if
necessary
masters
and
then
to
report
his
opinion
to
cheltenham
then
fearing
that
her
nephew
might
be
away
for
a
day
or
two
or
that
he
might
not
be
able
to
perform
his
commission
instantly
and
thinking
that
mary
might
be
unhappy
if
she
received
no
immediate
reply
to
such
a
request
as
hers
had
been
lady
ushant
by
the
same
post
wrote
to
her
young
friend
as
follows
dear
mary
reginald
will
go
over
and
see
your
father
about
your
proposition
as
far
as
i
myself
am
concerned
nothing
would
give
me
so
much
pleasure
this
is
quite
sincere
but
the
matter
is
in
other
respects
very
important
of
course
i
have
kept
your
letter
all
to
myself
and
in
writing
to
reginald
i
have
mentioned
no
names
your
affectionate
friend
margaret
ushant
chapter
xvii
particularly
proud
of
you
arabella
trefoil
left
her
uncle
mansion
on
the
day
after
her
lover
departure
certainly
not
in
triumph
but
with
somewhat
recovered
spirits
when
she
first
heard
that
lord
rufford
was
gone
that
he
had
fled
away
as
it
were
in
the
middle
of
the
night
without
saying
a
word
to
her
without
a
syllable
to
make
good
the
slight
assurances
of
his
love
that
had
been
given
to
her
in
the
post
carriage
she
felt
that
she
was
deserted
and
betrayed
and
when
she
found
herself
altogether
neglected
on
the
following
day
and
that
the
slightly
valuable
impression
which
she
had
made
on
her
aunt
was
apparently
gone
she
did
for
half
an
hour
think
in
earnest
of
the
paragon
and
patagonia
but
after
a
while
she
called
to
mind
all
that
she
knew
of
great
efforts
successfully
made
in
opposition
to
almost
overwhelming
difficulties
she
had
heard
of
forlorn
hopes
and
perhaps
in
her
young
days
had
read
something
of
cæsar
still
clinging
to
his
commentaries
as
he
struggled
in
the
waves
this
was
her
forlorn
hope
and
she
would
be
as
brave
as
any
soldier
of
them
all
lord
rufford
embraces
were
her
commentaries
and
let
the
winds
blow
and
the
waves
roll
as
they
might
she
would
still
cling
to
them
after
lunch
she
spoke
to
her
aunt
with
great
courage
as
the
duchess
thought
with
great
effrontery
my
uncle
would
speak
to
lord
rufford
before
he
went
how
could
he
speak
to
a
man
who
ran
away
from
his
house
in
that
way
the
running
away
as
you
call
it
aunt
did
not
take
place
till
two
days
after
i
had
told
you
all
about
it
i
thought
he
would
have
done
as
much
as
that
for
his
brother
daughter
i
do
believe
in
it
at
all
said
the
duchess
sternly
do
believe
in
what
aunt
you
do
mean
to
say
that
you
believe
that
lord
rufford
has
asked
me
to
be
his
wife
then
she
paused
but
the
duchess
absolutely
lacked
the
courage
to
express
her
conviction
again
i
do
suppose
it
signifies
much
continued
arabella
but
of
course
it
would
have
been
something
to
me
that
lord
rufford
should
have
known
that
the
duke
was
anxious
for
my
welfare
he
was
quite
prepared
to
have
assured
my
uncle
of
his
intentions
then
why
did
he
speak
himself
because
the
duke
is
not
my
father
really
aunt
when
i
hear
you
talk
of
his
running
away
i
do
feel
it
to
be
unkind
as
if
we
all
know
that
a
man
like
that
goes
and
comes
as
he
pleases
it
was
just
before
dinner
that
he
got
the
message
and
was
he
to
run
round
and
wish
everybody
like
a
schoolgirl
going
to
bed
the
duchess
was
almost
certain
that
no
message
had
come
and
from
various
little
things
which
she
had
observed
and
from
tidings
which
had
reached
her
very
much
doubted
whether
arabella
had
known
anything
of
his
intended
going
she
too
had
a
maid
of
her
own
who
on
occasions
could
bring
information
but
she
had
nothing
further
to
say
on
the
subject
if
arabella
should
ever
become
lady
rufford
she
would
of
course
among
other
visitors
be
occasionally
received
at
mistletoe
she
could
never
be
a
favourite
but
things
would
to
a
certain
degree
have
rectified
themselves
but
if
as
the
duchess
expected
no
such
marriage
took
place
then
this
niece
should
never
be
admitted
within
the
house
again
later
on
in
the
afternoon
some
hours
after
it
became
dusk
arabella
contrived
to
meet
her
aunt
in
the
hall
with
a
letter
in
her
hand
and
asked
where
the
was
she
knew
where
to
deposit
her
letters
as
well
as
did
the
duchess
herself
but
she
desired
an
opportunity
of
proclaiming
what
she
had
done
i
am
writing
to
lord
rufford
perhaps
as
i
am
in
your
house
i
ought
to
tell
you
what
i
have
done
the
is
in
the
close
to
the
door
said
the
duchess
passing
on
then
she
added
as
she
went
the
post
for
has
gone
already
his
lordship
will
have
to
wait
a
day
for
his
letter
i
dare
say
it
wo
break
his
heart
said
arabella
as
she
turned
away
to
the
all
this
had
been
planned
and
moreover
she
had
so
written
her
letter
that
if
her
magnificent
aunt
should
condescend
to
tamper
with
it
all
that
was
in
it
should
seem
to
corroborate
her
own
story
the
duchess
would
have
considered
herself
disgraced
if
ever
she
had
done
such
a
thing
but
the
niece
of
the
duchess
did
not
quite
understand
that
this
would
be
so
the
letter
was
as
follows
mistletoe
jany
dearest
your
going
off
like
that
was
after
all
very
horrid
my
aunt
thinks
that
you
were
running
away
from
me
i
think
that
you
were
running
away
from
her
which
was
true
in
real
earnest
i
do
for
a
moment
think
that
either
i
or
the
duchess
had
anything
to
do
with
it
and
that
you
did
go
because
some
horrid
man
wrote
and
asked
you
i
know
you
do
like
being
bound
by
any
of
the
conventionalities
i
hope
there
is
such
a
word
and
that
if
not
understand
it
just
the
same
oh
peltry
and
oh
jack
and
oh
that
road
back
to
stamford
i
am
so
stiff
that
i
ca
sit
upright
and
everybody
is
cross
to
me
and
everything
is
uncomfortable
what
horrible
things
women
are
there
is
one
here
not
even
old
lady
rumpus
who
has
an
unmarried
daughter
left
in
the
world
who
is
jealous
of
me
because
because
i
must
leave
you
to
guess
why
they
all
hate
me
so
and
i
sure
if
you
had
given
jack
to
any
other
woman
i
should
hate
her
though
you
may
give
every
horse
you
have
to
any
man
that
you
please
i
wonder
whether
i
shall
have
another
day
hunting
before
it
is
all
over
i
suppose
not
it
was
almost
by
a
miracle
that
we
managed
yesterday
only
fancy
yesterday
it
seems
to
be
an
age
ago
pray
pray
pray
write
to
me
at
once
to
the
connop
greens
so
that
i
may
get
a
nice
soft
pleasant
word
directly
i
get
among
those
nasty
hard
unpleasant
people
they
have
lots
of
money
and
plenty
of
furniture
and
i
dare
say
the
best
things
to
eat
and
drink
in
the
world
but
nothing
else
there
will
be
no
jack
and
if
there
were
alas
alas
no
one
to
show
me
the
way
to
ride
him
i
start
and
as
far
as
i
understand
shall
have
to
make
my
way
into
hampshire
all
by
myself
with
only
such
security
as
my
maid
can
give
me
i
shall
make
her
go
in
the
same
carriage
and
shall
have
the
gratification
of
looking
at
her
all
the
way
i
suppose
i
ought
not
to
say
that
i
will
shut
my
eyes
and
try
to
think
that
somebody
else
is
there
dear
dear
dear
i
shall
be
dying
for
a
letter
from
you
yours
ever
with
all
my
heart
i
shall
write
you
such
a
serious
epistle
when
i
get
to
the
greens
this
was
not
such
a
letter
as
she
thought
that
her
aunt
would
approve
but
it
was
she
fancied
such
as
the
duchess
would
believe
that
she
would
write
to
her
lover
and
if
it
were
allowed
to
go
on
its
way
it
would
make
lord
rufford
feel
that
she
was
neither
alarmed
nor
displeased
by
the
suddenness
of
his
departure
but
it
was
not
expected
to
do
much
good
it
might
produce
some
short
joking
reply
but
would
not
draw
from
him
that
serious
word
which
was
so
necessary
for
the
success
of
her
scheme
therefore
she
had
told
him
that
she
intended
to
prepare
a
serious
missile
should
this
pleasant
little
message
of
love
miscarry
the
serious
missile
would
still
be
sent
and
the
miscarriage
would
occasion
no
harm
but
then
further
plans
were
necessary
it
might
be
that
lord
rufford
would
take
no
notice
of
the
serious
missile
which
she
thought
very
probable
or
it
might
be
that
he
would
send
back
a
serious
reply
in
which
he
would
calmly
explain
to
her
that
she
had
unfortunately
mistaken
his
sentiments
which
she
believed
would
be
a
stretch
of
manhood
beyond
his
reach
but
in
either
case
she
would
be
prepared
with
the
course
which
she
would
follow
in
the
first
she
would
begin
by
forcing
her
father
to
write
to
him
a
letter
which
she
herself
would
dictate
in
the
second
she
would
set
the
whole
family
at
him
as
far
as
the
family
were
within
her
reach
with
her
cousin
lord
mistletoe
who
was
only
two
years
older
than
herself
she
had
always
held
pleasant
relations
they
had
been
children
together
and
as
they
had
grown
up
the
young
lord
had
liked
his
pretty
cousin
latterly
they
had
seen
each
other
but
rarely
and
therefore
the
feeling
still
remained
she
would
tell
lord
mistletoe
her
whole
story
that
is
the
story
as
she
would
please
to
tell
it
and
implore
his
aid
her
father
should
be
driven
to
demand
from
lord
rufford
an
execution
of
his
alleged
promises
she
herself
would
write
such
a
letter
to
the
duke
as
an
uncle
should
be
unable
not
to
notice
she
would
move
heaven
and
earth
as
to
her
wrongs
she
thought
that
if
her
friends
would
stick
to
her
lord
rufford
would
be
weak
as
water
in
their
hands
but
it
must
be
all
done
immediately
so
that
if
everything
failed
she
might
be
ready
to
start
to
patagonia
some
time
in
april
when
she
looked
back
and
remembered
that
it
was
hardly
more
than
two
months
since
she
had
been
taken
to
rufford
hall
by
morton
she
could
not
accuse
herself
of
having
lost
any
time
in
london
she
met
her
mother
as
to
which
meeting
there
had
been
some
doubt
and
underwent
the
tortures
of
a
close
examination
she
had
thought
it
prudent
on
this
occasion
to
tell
her
mother
something
but
not
to
tell
anything
quite
truly
he
has
proposed
to
me
she
said
he
has
said
lady
augustus
holding
up
her
hands
almost
in
awe
is
there
anything
so
wonderful
in
that
then
it
is
all
arranged
does
the
duke
know
it
it
is
not
all
arranged
by
any
means
and
the
duke
does
know
it
now
mamma
after
that
i
must
decline
to
answer
any
more
questions
i
have
done
this
all
myself
and
i
mean
to
continue
it
in
the
same
way
did
he
speak
to
the
duke
you
will
tell
me
that
i
will
tell
you
nothing
you
will
drive
me
mad
arabella
that
will
be
better
than
your
driving
me
mad
just
at
present
you
ought
to
feel
that
i
have
a
great
deal
to
think
of
and
have
not
i
you
ca
help
me
not
at
present
but
he
did
propose
in
absolute
words
mamma
what
a
goose
you
are
do
you
suppose
that
men
do
it
all
now
just
as
it
is
done
in
books
arabella
trefoil
will
you
do
me
the
honour
to
become
my
wife
do
you
think
that
lord
rufford
would
ask
the
question
in
that
way
it
is
a
very
good
way
any
way
is
a
good
way
that
answers
the
purpose
he
has
proposed
and
i
mean
to
make
him
stick
to
it
you
doubt
then
mamma
you
are
so
silly
do
you
not
know
what
such
a
man
is
well
enough
to
be
sure
that
he
change
his
mind
times
if
he
can
i
do
mean
to
let
him
and
now
after
that
i
wo
say
another
word
i
have
got
a
letter
here
from
short
saying
that
something
must
be
fixed
about
mr
morton
short
was
the
lawyer
who
had
been
instructed
to
prepare
the
settlements
short
may
do
whatever
he
likes
said
arabella
there
were
very
hot
words
between
them
that
night
in
london
but
the
mother
could
obtain
no
further
information
from
her
daughter
that
serious
epistle
had
been
commenced
even
before
arabella
had
left
mistletoe
but
the
composition
was
one
which
required
great
care
and
it
was
not
completed
and
copied
and
recopied
till
she
had
been
two
days
in
hampshire
not
even
when
it
was
finished
did
she
say
a
word
to
her
mother
about
it
she
had
doubted
much
as
to
the
phrases
which
in
such
an
emergency
she
ought
to
use
but
she
thought
it
safer
to
trust
to
herself
than
to
her
mother
in
writing
such
a
letter
as
that
posted
at
mistletoe
she
believed
herself
to
be
happy
she
could
write
it
quickly
and
understood
that
she
could
convey
to
her
correspondent
some
sense
of
her
assumed
mood
but
her
serious
letter
would
she
feared
be
stiff
and
repulsive
whether
her
fears
were
right
the
reader
shall
judge
for
the
letter
when
written
was
as
follows
marygold
place
basingstoke
saturday
my
dear
lord
rufford
you
will
i
suppose
have
got
the
letter
that
i
wrote
before
i
left
mistletoe
and
which
i
directed
to
surbiton
there
was
not
much
in
it
except
a
word
or
two
as
to
your
going
and
as
to
my
desolation
and
just
a
reminiscence
of
the
hunting
there
was
no
reproach
that
you
should
have
left
me
without
any
farewell
or
that
you
should
have
gone
so
suddenly
after
saying
so
much
without
saying
more
i
wanted
you
to
feel
that
you
had
made
me
very
happy
and
not
to
feel
that
your
departure
in
such
a
way
had
robbed
me
of
part
of
the
happiness
it
was
a
little
bad
of
you
because
it
did
of
course
leave
me
to
the
hardness
of
my
aunt
and
because
all
the
other
women
there
would
of
course
follow
her
she
had
inquired
about
our
journey
home
that
dear
journey
home
and
i
had
of
course
told
her
well
i
had
better
say
it
out
at
once
i
told
her
that
we
were
engaged
you
i
am
sure
will
think
that
the
truth
was
best
she
wanted
to
know
why
you
did
not
go
to
the
duke
i
told
her
that
the
duke
was
not
my
father
but
that
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
the
duke
might
speak
to
you
or
not
as
he
pleased
i
had
nothing
to
conceal
i
am
very
glad
he
did
not
because
he
is
pompous
and
you
would
have
been
bored
if
there
is
one
thing
i
desire
more
than
another
it
is
that
nothing
belonging
to
me
shall
ever
be
a
bore
to
you
i
hope
i
may
never
stand
in
the
way
of
anything
that
will
gratify
you
as
i
said
when
you
lit
that
cigar
you
will
have
forgotten
i
dare
say
but
dear
rufford
dearest
i
may
say
that
i
say
something
or
do
something
to
make
me
satisfied
you
know
what
i
mean
do
you
it
is
that
i
am
a
bit
afraid
myself
i
do
think
so
little
of
myself
or
so
badly
of
you
but
i
do
like
other
women
to
look
at
me
as
though
i
ought
not
to
be
proud
of
anything
i
am
proud
of
everything
particularly
proud
of
you
and
of
jack
now
there
is
my
serious
epistle
and
i
am
sure
that
you
will
answer
it
like
a
dear
good
loving
lover
i
wo
be
afraid
of
writing
the
word
nor
of
saying
that
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
and
that
i
am
always
your
own
arabella
she
kept
the
letter
till
the
sunday
thinking
that
she
might
have
an
answer
to
that
written
from
mistletoe
and
that
his
reply
might
alter
its
tone
or
induce
her
to
put
it
aside
altogether
but
when
on
sunday
morning
none
came
her
own
was
sent
the
word
in
it
which
frightened
herself
was
the
word
engaged
she
tried
various
other
phrases
but
declared
to
herself
at
last
that
it
was
useless
to
beat
about
the
bush
he
must
know
the
light
in
which
she
was
pleased
to
regard
those
passages
of
love
which
she
had
permitted
so
that
there
might
be
no
mistake
whether
the
letter
would
be
to
his
liking
or
not
it
must
be
of
such
a
nature
that
it
would
certainly
draw
from
him
an
answer
on
which
she
could
act
she
herself
did
not
like
the
letter
but
considering
her
difficulties
we
may
own
that
it
was
not
much
amiss
chapter
xviii
lord
rufford
makes
up
his
mind
as
it
happened
lord
rufford
got
the
two
letters
together
the
cause
of
which
was
as
follows
when
he
ran
away
from
mistletoe
as
he
certainly
did
he
had
thought
much
about
that
journey
home
in
the
carriage
and
was
quite
aware
that
he
had
made
an
ass
of
himself
as
he
sat
at
dinner
on
that
day
at
mistletoe
his
neighbour
had
said
some
word
to
him
in
joke
as
to
his
attachment
to
miss
trefoil
and
after
the
ladies
had
left
the
room
another
neighbour
of
the
other
sex
had
hoped
that
he
had
had
a
pleasant
time
on
the
road
again
in
the
it
had
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
observed
he
could
not
refrain
from
saying
a
few
words
to
arabella
as
she
lay
on
the
sofa
not
to
do
so
after
what
had
occurred
would
have
been
in
itself
peculiar
but
when
he
did
so
some
other
man
who
was
near
her
made
way
for
him
as
though
she
were
acknowledged
to
be
altogether
his
property
and
then
the
duchess
had
striven
to
catch
him
and
lead
him
into
special
conversation
when
this
attempt
was
made
he
decided
that
he
must
at
once
retreat
or
else
make
up
his
mind
to
marry
the
young
lady
and
therefore
he
retreated
he
breakfasted
that
morning
at
the
inn
at
stamford
and
as
he
smoked
his
cigar
afterwards
he
positively
resolved
that
he
would
under
no
circumstances
marry
arabella
trefoil
he
was
being
hunted
and
run
down
and
with
the
instinct
of
all
animals
that
are
hunted
he
prepared
himself
for
escape
it
might
be
said
no
doubt
would
be
said
that
he
behaved
badly
that
would
be
said
because
it
would
not
be
open
to
him
to
tell
the
truth
the
lady
in
such
a
case
can
always
tell
her
story
with
what
exaggeration
she
may
please
to
give
and
can
complain
the
man
never
can
do
so
when
inquired
into
he
can
not
say
that
he
has
been
pursued
he
can
not
tell
her
friends
that
she
began
it
and
in
point
of
fact
did
it
all
she
would
fall
into
my
arms
she
would
embrace
me
she
persisted
in
asking
me
whether
i
loved
her
though
a
man
have
to
be
shot
for
it
or
kicked
for
it
or
even
though
he
have
to
endure
perpetual
scorn
for
it
he
can
not
say
that
let
it
be
ever
so
true
and
yet
is
a
man
to
be
forced
into
a
marriage
which
he
despises
he
would
not
be
forced
into
the
marriage
and
the
sooner
he
retreated
the
less
would
be
the
metaphorical
shooting
and
kicking
and
the
real
scorn
he
must
get
out
of
it
as
best
he
could
but
that
he
would
get
out
of
it
he
was
quite
determined
that
afternoon
he
reached
surbiton
house
as
did
also
captain
battersby
and
his
horses
grooms
and
other
belongings
when
there
he
received
a
lot
of
letters
and
among
others
one
from
runciman
of
the
bush
inquiring
as
to
a
certain
hiring
of
rooms
and
preparation
for
a
dinner
or
dinners
which
had
been
spoken
of
in
reference
to
a
final
shooting
decreed
to
take
place
in
the
neighbourhood
of
dillsborough
in
the
last
week
of
january
such
things
were
often
planned
by
lord
rufford
and
afterwards
forgotten
or
neglected
when
he
declared
his
purpose
to
runciman
he
had
not
intended
to
go
to
mistletoe
nor
to
stay
so
long
with
his
friend
surbiton
but
now
he
almost
thought
that
it
would
be
better
for
him
to
be
back
at
rufford
hall
where
at
present
his
sister
was
staying
with
her
husband
sir
george
penwether
in
the
evening
of
the
second
or
third
day
his
old
friend
tom
surbiton
said
a
few
words
to
him
which
had
the
effect
of
sending
him
back
to
rufford
they
had
sat
out
the
rest
of
the
men
who
formed
the
party
and
were
alone
in
the
so
you
going
to
marry
miss
trefoil
said
tom
surbiton
who
perhaps
of
all
his
friends
was
the
most
intimate
who
says
so
i
am
saying
so
at
present
you
are
not
saying
it
on
your
own
authority
you
have
never
seen
me
and
miss
trefoil
in
a
room
together
everybody
says
so
of
course
such
a
thing
can
not
be
arranged
without
being
talked
about
it
has
not
been
arranged
if
you
do
mean
to
have
it
arranged
you
had
better
look
to
it
i
am
speaking
in
earnest
rufford
i
am
not
going
to
give
up
authorities
indeed
if
i
did
i
might
give
up
everybody
the
very
servants
suppose
that
they
know
it
and
there
is
a
groom
or
horseboy
about
who
is
in
his
heart
congratulating
the
young
lady
on
her
promotion
i
tell
you
what
it
is
tom
well
what
is
it
if
this
had
come
from
any
other
man
than
yourself
i
should
quarrel
with
him
i
am
not
engaged
to
the
young
lady
nor
have
i
done
anything
to
warrant
anybody
in
saying
so
then
i
may
contradict
it
i
do
want
you
either
to
contradict
it
or
affirm
it
it
would
be
an
impertinence
to
the
young
lady
if
i
were
to
instruct
any
one
to
contradict
such
a
report
but
as
a
fact
i
am
not
engaged
to
marry
miss
trefoil
nor
is
there
the
slightest
chance
that
i
ever
shall
be
so
engaged
so
saying
he
took
up
his
candlestick
and
walked
off
early
on
the
next
morning
he
saw
his
friend
and
made
some
sort
of
laughing
apology
for
his
heat
on
the
previous
evening
it
is
so
d
hard
when
these
kind
of
things
are
said
because
a
man
has
lent
a
young
lady
a
horse
however
tom
between
you
and
me
the
thing
is
a
lie
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
it
said
tom
and
now
i
want
you
to
come
over
to
rufford
on
the
then
he
explained
the
details
of
his
proposed
party
and
got
his
friend
to
promise
that
he
would
come
he
also
made
it
understood
that
he
was
going
home
at
once
there
were
a
hundred
things
he
said
which
made
it
necessary
so
the
horses
and
grooms
and
servant
and
portmanteaus
were
again
made
to
move
and
lord
rufford
left
his
friend
on
that
day
and
went
up
to
london
on
his
road
to
rufford
he
was
certainly
disturbed
in
his
mind
foreseeing
that
there
might
be
much
difficulty
in
his
way
he
remembered
with
fair
accuracy
all
that
had
occurred
during
the
journey
from
stamford
to
mistletoe
he
felt
assured
that
up
to
that
time
he
had
said
nothing
which
could
be
taken
to
mean
a
real
declaration
of
love
all
that
at
rufford
had
been
nothing
he
had
never
said
a
word
which
could
justify
the
girl
in
a
hope
in
the
carriage
she
had
asked
him
whether
he
loved
her
and
he
had
said
that
he
did
he
had
also
declared
that
he
would
do
anything
in
his
power
to
make
her
happy
was
a
man
to
be
bound
to
marry
a
girl
because
of
such
a
scene
as
that
there
was
however
nothing
for
him
to
do
except
to
keep
out
of
the
girl
way
if
she
took
any
steps
then
he
must
act
but
as
he
thought
of
it
he
swore
to
himself
that
nothing
should
induce
him
to
marry
her
he
remained
a
couple
of
days
in
town
and
reached
rufford
hall
on
the
monday
just
a
week
from
the
day
of
that
fatal
meet
at
peltry
there
he
found
sir
george
and
his
sister
and
miss
penge
and
spent
his
first
evening
in
quiet
on
the
tuesday
he
hunted
with
the
and
made
his
arrangements
with
runciman
he
invited
hampton
to
shoot
with
him
surbiton
and
battersby
were
coming
and
his
not
wishing
to
have
less
than
six
guns
he
asked
hampton
how
he
could
make
up
his
party
morton
does
shoot
he
said
and
is
as
stiff
as
a
post
then
he
was
told
that
john
morton
was
supposed
to
be
very
ill
at
bragton
i
sick
of
both
the
botseys
continued
the
lord
thinking
more
of
his
party
than
of
morton
health
purefoy
is
still
sulky
with
me
because
he
killed
poor
old
caneback
then
hampton
suggested
that
if
he
would
ask
lawrence
twentyman
it
might
be
the
means
of
saving
that
unfortunate
young
man
life
the
story
of
his
unrequited
love
was
known
to
every
one
at
dillsborough
and
it
was
now
told
to
lord
rufford
he
is
not
half
a
bad
fellow
said
hampton
and
quite
as
much
like
a
gentleman
as
either
of
the
botseys
i
shall
be
delighted
to
save
the
life
of
so
good
a
man
on
such
easy
terms
said
the
lord
then
and
there
with
a
pencil
on
the
back
of
an
old
letter
he
wrote
a
line
to
larry
asking
him
to
shoot
on
next
saturday
and
to
dine
with
him
afterwards
at
the
bush
that
evening
on
his
return
home
he
found
both
the
letters
from
arabella
as
it
happened
he
read
them
in
the
order
in
which
they
had
been
written
first
the
laughing
letter
and
then
the
one
that
was
declared
to
be
serious
the
earlier
of
the
two
did
not
annoy
him
much
it
contained
hardly
more
than
those
former
letters
which
had
induced
him
to
go
to
mistletoe
but
the
second
letter
opened
up
her
entire
strategy
she
had
told
the
duchess
that
she
was
engaged
to
him
and
the
duchess
of
course
would
have
told
the
duke
and
now
she
wrote
to
him
asking
him
to
acknowledge
the
engagement
in
black
and
white
the
first
letter
he
might
have
ignored
he
might
have
left
it
unanswered
without
gross
misconduct
but
the
second
letter
which
she
herself
had
declared
to
be
a
serious
epistle
was
one
which
he
could
not
neglect
now
had
come
his
difficulty
what
must
he
do
how
should
he
answer
it
was
it
imperative
on
him
to
write
the
words
with
his
own
hand
would
it
be
possible
that
he
should
get
his
sister
to
undertake
the
commission
he
said
nothing
about
it
to
any
one
for
four
and
twenty
hours
but
he
passed
those
hours
in
much
discomfort
it
did
seem
so
hard
to
him
that
because
he
had
been
forced
to
carry
a
lady
home
from
hunting
in
a
postchaise
that
he
should
be
driven
to
such
straits
as
this
the
girl
was
evidently
prepared
to
make
a
fight
of
it
there
would
be
the
duke
and
the
duchess
and
that
prig
mistletoe
and
that
idle
ass
lord
augustus
and
that
venomous
old
woman
her
mother
all
at
him
he
almost
doubted
whether
a
shooting
excursion
in
central
africa
or
a
visit
to
the
pampas
would
not
be
the
best
thing
for
him
but
still
though
he
should
resolve
to
pass
five
years
among
the
andes
he
must
answer
the
lady
letter
before
he
went
then
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
tell
everything
to
his
as
far
as
everything
can
be
told
in
such
a
matter
sir
george
was
near
fifty
full
fifteen
years
older
than
his
wife
who
was
again
older
than
her
brother
he
was
a
man
of
moderate
wealth
very
much
respected
and
supposed
to
be
possessed
of
almost
infinite
wisdom
he
was
one
of
those
few
human
beings
who
seem
never
to
make
a
mistake
whatever
he
put
his
hand
to
came
out
well
and
yet
everybody
liked
him
his
was
a
little
afraid
of
him
but
yet
was
always
glad
to
see
him
he
kept
an
excellent
house
in
london
but
having
no
country
house
of
his
own
passed
much
of
his
time
at
rufford
hall
when
the
owner
was
not
there
in
spite
of
the
young
peer
numerous
faults
sir
george
was
much
attached
to
him
and
always
ready
to
help
him
in
his
difficulties
penwether
said
the
lord
i
have
got
myself
into
an
awful
scrape
i
am
sorry
to
hear
it
a
woman
i
suppose
oh
yes
i
never
gamble
and
therefore
no
other
scrape
can
be
awful
a
young
lady
wants
to
marry
me
that
is
not
unnatural
but
i
am
quite
determined
let
the
result
be
what
it
may
that
i
wo
marry
the
young
lady
that
will
be
unfortunate
for
her
and
the
more
so
if
she
has
a
right
to
expect
it
is
the
young
lady
miss
trefoil
i
did
not
mean
to
mention
any
name
till
i
was
sure
it
might
be
necessary
but
it
is
miss
trefoil
eleanor
had
told
me
something
of
it
eleanor
knows
nothing
about
this
and
i
do
not
wish
you
to
tell
her
the
young
lady
was
here
with
her
mother
and
for
the
matter
of
that
with
a
gentleman
to
whom
she
was
certainly
engaged
but
nothing
particular
occurred
here
that
unfortunate
ball
was
going
on
when
poor
caneback
was
dying
but
i
met
her
since
that
at
mistletoe
i
can
hardly
advise
you
know
unless
you
tell
me
everything
then
lord
rufford
began
these
kind
of
things
are
sometimes
deuced
hard
upon
a
man
of
course
if
a
man
were
a
saint
or
a
philosopher
or
a
joseph
he
would
get
into
such
scrapes
and
perhaps
every
man
ought
to
be
something
of
that
sort
but
i
do
know
how
a
man
is
to
do
it
unless
it
born
with
him
a
little
prudence
i
should
say
you
might
as
well
tell
a
fellow
that
it
is
his
duty
to
be
six
feet
high
but
what
have
you
said
to
the
young
lady
or
what
has
she
said
to
you
there
has
been
a
great
deal
more
of
the
latter
than
the
former
i
say
so
to
you
but
of
course
it
is
not
to
be
said
that
i
have
said
so
i
can
not
go
forth
to
the
world
complaining
of
a
young
conduct
to
me
it
is
a
matter
in
which
a
man
must
not
tell
the
truth
but
what
is
the
truth
she
writes
me
word
to
say
that
she
has
told
all
her
friends
that
i
am
engaged
to
her
and
kindly
presses
me
to
make
good
her
assurances
by
becoming
so
and
what
has
passed
between
you
a
fainting
fit
in
a
carriage
and
kisses
nothing
more
nothing
more
that
is
material
of
course
one
can
not
tell
it
all
down
to
each
mawkish
word
of
humbugging
sentiment
there
are
her
letters
and
what
i
want
you
to
remember
is
that
i
never
asked
her
to
be
my
wife
and
that
no
consideration
on
earth
shall
induce
me
to
become
her
husband
though
all
the
duchesses
in
england
were
to
persecute
me
to
the
death
i
mean
to
stick
to
that
then
sir
george
read
the
letters
and
handed
them
back
she
seems
to
me
said
he
to
have
more
wit
about
her
than
any
of
the
family
that
i
have
had
the
honour
of
meeting
she
has
wit
enough
and
pluck
too
you
have
never
said
a
word
to
her
to
encourage
these
hopes
my
dear
penwether
do
you
know
that
if
a
man
with
a
large
income
says
to
a
girl
like
that
that
the
sun
shines
he
encourages
hope
i
understand
that
well
enough
i
am
a
rich
man
with
a
title
and
a
big
house
and
a
great
command
of
luxuries
there
are
so
many
young
ladies
who
would
also
like
to
be
rich
and
to
have
a
title
and
a
big
house
and
a
command
of
luxuries
one
sometimes
feels
oneself
like
a
carcase
in
the
midst
of
vultures
marry
after
a
proper
fashion
and
you
get
rid
of
all
that
i
think
about
it
but
in
the
meantime
what
can
i
say
to
this
young
woman
when
i
acknowledge
that
i
kissed
her
of
course
i
encouraged
hopes
no
doubt
but
anthony
would
have
had
to
kiss
this
young
woman
if
she
had
made
her
attack
upon
him
as
she
did
on
me
and
after
all
a
kiss
does
go
for
everything
these
are
things
penwether
that
must
not
be
inquired
into
too
curiously
but
i
wo
marry
her
though
it
were
a
score
of
kisses
and
now
what
must
i
do
sir
george
said
that
he
would
take
till
the
next
morning
to
think
about
it
meaning
to
make
a
draft
of
the
reply
which
he
thought
his
might
best
send
to
the
lady
chapter
xix
it
can
not
be
arranged
when
reginald
morton
received
his
aunt
letter
he
understood
from
it
more
than
she
had
intended
of
course
the
man
to
whom
allusion
was
made
was
twentyman
and
of
course
the
discomfort
at
home
had
come
from
masters
approval
of
that
suitor
claim
reginald
though
he
had
seen
but
little
of
the
inside
of
the
attorney
household
thought
it
very
probable
that
the
stepmother
would
make
the
home
very
uncomfortable
for
her
though
he
knew
well
all
the
young
farmer
qualifications
as
a
husband
namely
that
he
was
well
to
do
in
the
world
and
bore
a
good
character
for
honesty
and
general
conduct
still
he
thoroughly
nay
heartily
approved
of
rejection
of
the
man
hand
it
seemed
to
him
to
be
sacrilege
that
such
a
one
should
have
given
to
him
such
a
woman
there
was
to
his
thinking
something
about
mary
masters
that
made
it
altogether
unfit
that
she
should
pass
her
life
as
the
mistress
of
chowton
farm
and
he
honoured
her
for
the
persistence
of
her
refusal
he
took
his
pipe
and
went
out
into
the
garden
in
order
that
he
might
think
of
it
all
as
he
strolled
round
his
little
domain
but
why
should
he
think
so
much
about
it
why
should
he
take
so
deep
an
interest
in
the
matter
what
was
it
to
him
whether
mary
masters
married
after
her
kind
or
descended
into
what
he
felt
to
be
an
inferior
manner
of
life
then
he
tried
to
tell
himself
what
were
the
gifts
in
the
girl
possession
which
made
her
what
she
was
and
he
pictured
her
to
himself
running
over
all
her
attributes
it
was
not
that
she
specially
excelled
in
beauty
he
had
seen
miss
trefoil
as
she
was
being
driven
about
the
neighbourhood
and
having
heard
much
of
the
young
lady
as
the
future
wife
of
his
own
cousin
had
acknowledged
to
himself
that
she
was
very
handsome
but
he
had
thought
at
the
same
time
that
under
no
possible
circumstances
could
he
have
fallen
in
love
with
miss
trefoil
he
believed
that
he
did
not
care
much
for
female
beauty
and
yet
he
felt
that
he
could
sit
and
look
at
mary
masters
by
the
hour
together
there
was
a
quiet
even
composure
about
her
always
lightened
by
the
brightness
of
her
modest
eyes
which
seemed
to
tell
him
of
some
mysterious
world
within
which
was
like
the
unseen
loveliness
that
one
fancies
to
be
hidden
within
the
bosom
of
distant
mountains
there
was
a
poem
to
be
read
there
of
surpassing
beauty
rhythmical
and
eloquent
as
the
music
of
the
spheres
if
it
might
only
be
given
to
a
man
to
read
it
there
was
an
absence
too
of
all
attempt
at
feminine
which
he
did
not
analyse
but
thoroughly
appreciated
there
was
no
fussy
amplification
of
hair
no
smiles
no
affectation
either
in
her
good
humour
or
her
anger
no
attempt
at
effect
in
her
gait
in
her
speech
or
her
looks
she
seemed
to
him
to
be
one
who
had
something
within
her
on
which
she
could
feed
independently
of
the
grosser
details
of
the
world
to
which
it
was
her
duty
to
lend
her
hand
and
then
her
colour
charmed
his
eyes
miss
trefoil
was
white
and
red
white
as
pearl
powder
and
red
as
paint
mary
masters
to
tell
the
truth
was
brown
no
doubt
that
was
the
prevailing
colour
if
one
colour
must
be
named
but
there
was
so
rich
a
tint
of
young
life
beneath
the
surface
so
soft
but
yet
so
visible
an
assurance
of
blood
and
health
and
spirit
that
no
one
could
describe
her
complexion
by
so
ugly
a
word
without
falsifying
her
gifts
in
all
her
movements
she
was
tranquil
as
a
noble
woman
should
be
even
when
she
had
turned
from
him
with
some
anger
at
the
bridge
she
had
walked
like
a
princess
there
was
a
certainty
of
modesty
about
her
which
was
like
a
granite
wall
or
a
strong
fortress
as
he
thought
of
it
all
he
did
not
understand
how
such
a
one
as
lawrence
twentyman
should
have
dared
to
ask
her
to
be
his
wife
or
should
even
have
wished
it
we
know
what
were
her
feelings
in
regard
to
himself
how
she
had
come
to
look
almost
with
worship
on
the
walls
within
which
he
lived
but
he
had
guessed
nothing
of
this
even
now
when
he
knew
that
she
had
applied
to
his
aunt
in
order
that
she
might
escape
from
her
lover
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
she
could
care
for
himself
he
was
older
than
she
nearly
twenty
years
older
and
even
in
his
younger
years
in
the
hard
struggles
of
his
early
life
had
never
regarded
himself
as
a
man
likely
to
find
favour
with
women
there
was
in
his
character
much
of
that
modesty
for
which
he
gave
her
such
infinite
credit
though
he
thought
but
little
of
most
of
those
around
him
he
thought
also
but
little
of
himself
it
would
break
his
heart
to
ask
and
be
refused
but
he
could
he
fancied
live
very
well
without
mary
masters
such
at
any
rate
had
been
his
own
idea
of
himself
hitherto
and
now
though
he
was
driven
to
think
much
of
her
though
on
the
present
occasion
he
was
forced
to
act
on
her
behalf
he
would
not
tell
himself
that
he
wanted
to
take
her
for
his
wife
he
constantly
assured
himself
that
he
wanted
no
wife
that
for
him
a
solitary
life
would
be
the
best
but
yet
it
made
him
wretched
when
he
reflected
that
some
man
would
assuredly
marry
mary
masters
he
had
heard
of
that
excellent
but
young
man
surtees
when
the
idea
occurred
to
him
he
found
himself
reviling
surtees
as
being
of
all
men
the
most
puny
the
most
unmanly
and
the
least
worthy
of
marrying
mary
masters
now
that
twentyman
was
certainly
disposed
of
he
almost
became
jealous
of
surtees
it
was
not
till
three
or
four
in
the
afternoon
that
he
went
out
on
his
commission
to
the
attorney
house
having
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
do
everything
in
his
power
to
facilitate
proposed
return
to
cheltenham
he
asked
first
for
masters
and
then
for
miss
masters
and
learned
that
they
were
both
out
together
but
he
had
been
desired
also
to
see
masters
and
on
inquiring
for
her
was
again
shown
into
the
grand
here
he
remained
a
quarter
of
an
hour
while
the
lady
of
the
house
was
changing
her
cap
and
apron
which
he
spent
in
convincing
himself
that
this
house
was
altogether
an
unfit
residence
for
mary
in
the
chamber
in
which
he
was
standing
it
was
clear
enough
that
no
human
being
ever
lived
mary
ought
to
be
a
bower
in
which
she
at
least
might
pass
her
time
with
books
and
music
and
pretty
things
around
her
the
squalor
of
the
real
living
room
might
be
conjectured
from
the
untouched
cleanliness
of
this
useless
sanctum
at
last
the
lady
came
to
him
and
welcomed
him
with
very
grim
courtesy
as
a
client
of
her
husband
he
was
very
well
but
as
a
nephew
of
lady
ushant
he
was
injurious
it
was
he
who
had
carried
mary
away
to
cheltenham
where
she
had
been
instigated
to
throw
her
into
the
fire
as
masters
expressed
it
by
that
pernicious
old
woman
lady
ushant
masters
is
out
walking
she
said
reginald
clearly
understood
by
the
contempt
which
she
threw
almost
unconsciously
into
her
words
that
she
did
not
approve
of
her
husband
going
out
walking
at
such
an
hour
i
had
a
message
for
him
and
also
for
you
my
aunt
lady
ushant
is
very
anxious
that
your
daughter
mary
should
return
to
her
at
cheltenham
for
a
while
the
proposition
to
masters
thinking
was
so
monstrous
and
was
at
the
same
time
so
unexpected
that
it
almost
took
away
her
breath
at
any
rate
she
stood
for
a
moment
speechless
my
aunt
is
very
fond
of
your
daughter
he
continued
and
if
she
can
be
spared
would
be
delighted
to
have
her
perhaps
she
has
written
to
miss
masters
but
she
has
asked
me
to
come
over
and
see
if
it
can
not
be
arranged
it
can
not
be
arranged
said
masters
nothing
of
the
kind
can
be
arranged
i
am
sorry
for
that
it
is
only
disturbing
the
girl
and
upsetting
her
and
filling
her
head
full
of
nonsense
what
is
she
to
do
at
cheltenham
this
is
her
home
and
here
she
had
better
be
though
things
had
hitherto
gone
very
badly
though
larry
twentyman
had
not
shown
himself
since
the
receipt
of
the
letter
still
masters
had
not
abandoned
all
hope
she
was
fixed
in
opinion
that
if
her
husband
were
joined
with
her
they
could
still
between
them
so
break
the
girl
spirit
as
to
force
her
into
a
marriage
as
for
letters
she
continued
i
know
anything
about
them
there
may
have
been
letters
but
if
so
they
have
been
kept
from
me
she
was
so
angry
that
she
could
not
even
attempt
to
conceal
her
wrath
lady
ushant
thinks
began
the
messenger
oh
yes
lady
ushant
is
very
well
of
course
lady
ushant
is
your
aunt
morton
and
i
have
anything
to
say
against
her
but
lady
ushant
ca
do
any
good
to
that
girl
she
has
got
her
bread
to
earn
and
if
she
wo
do
it
one
way
then
she
must
do
it
another
obstinate
and
pigheaded
that
the
truth
of
it
and
her
just
as
bad
he
has
taken
her
out
now
merely
because
she
likes
to
be
idle
and
to
go
about
thinking
herself
a
fine
lady
lady
ushant
does
do
her
any
good
at
all
by
cockering
her
up
my
aunt
you
know
saw
very
much
of
her
when
she
was
young
i
know
she
did
morton
and
all
that
has
to
be
undone
and
i
have
got
the
undoing
of
it
lady
ushant
is
one
thing
and
her
business
is
quite
another
at
any
rate
if
i
have
my
say
she
not
go
to
cheltenham
any
more
i
do
mean
to
be
uncivil
to
you
morton
or
to
say
anything
as
ought
to
be
said
of
your
aunt
but
when
you
ca
make
people
anything
but
what
they
are
it
my
opinion
that
it
best
to
leave
them
alone
good
day
to
you
sir
and
i
hope
you
understand
what
it
is
that
i
mean
then
morton
retreated
and
went
down
the
stairs
leaving
the
lady
in
possession
of
her
own
grandeur
he
had
not
quite
understood
what
she
had
meant
and
was
still
wondering
at
the
energy
of
her
opposition
when
he
met
mary
herself
at
the
front
door
her
father
was
not
with
her
but
his
retreating
form
was
to
be
seen
entering
the
portal
of
the
bush
oh
mr
morton
exclaimed
mary
surprised
to
have
the
opened
for
her
by
him
i
have
come
with
a
message
from
my
aunt
she
told
me
that
you
would
do
so
lady
ushant
would
of
course
be
delighted
to
have
you
if
it
could
be
arranged
then
lady
ushant
will
be
disappointed
said
masters
who
had
descended
the
stairs
there
has
been
something
going
on
behind
my
back
i
wrote
to
lady
ushant
said
mary
i
call
that
sly
and
deceitful
very
sly
and
very
deceitful
if
i
know
it
you
wo
stir
out
of
this
house
to
go
to
cheltenham
i
wonder
lady
ushant
would
go
to
put
you
up
in
that
way
against
those
you
bound
to
obey
i
thought
masters
had
been
told
said
reginald
papa
did
know
that
i
wrote
said
mary
yes
and
in
this
way
a
conspiracy
is
to
be
made
up
in
the
house
if
she
goes
to
cheltenham
i
wo
stay
here
you
may
tell
lady
ushant
that
i
say
that
i
not
going
to
be
one
thing
one
day
and
another
another
and
to
be
made
a
tool
of
all
round
by
this
time
dolly
and
kate
had
come
down
from
the
upper
regions
and
were
standing
behind
their
mother
what
do
you
two
do
there
standing
gaping
like
fools
said
the
angry
mother
i
suppose
your
father
has
gone
over
to
the
again
that
miss
is
what
comes
from
your
pigheadedness
did
i
tell
you
that
you
were
ruining
everybody
belonging
to
you
before
all
this
was
over
reginald
morton
had
escaped
feeling
that
he
could
do
no
good
to
either
side
by
remaining
a
witness
to
such
a
scene
he
must
take
some
other
opportunity
of
finding
the
attorney
and
of
learning
from
him
whether
he
intended
that
his
daughter
should
be
allowed
to
accept
lady
invitation
poor
mary
as
she
shrunk
into
the
house
was
nearly
heartbroken
that
such
things
should
be
at
all
was
very
dreadful
but
that
the
scene
should
have
taken
place
in
the
presence
of
reginald
morton
was
an
aggravation
of
the
misery
which
nearly
overwhelmed
her
how
could
she
make
him
understand
whence
had
arisen
her
stepmother
anger
and
that
she
herself
had
been
neither
sly
nor
deceitful
nor
pigheaded
chapter
xx
but
there
is
some
one
when
masters
had
gone
across
to
the
bush
his
purpose
had
certainly
been
ignoble
but
it
had
had
no
reference
to
brandy
and
water
and
the
allusion
made
by
masters
to
the
probable
ruin
which
was
to
come
from
his
tendencies
in
that
direction
had
been
calumnious
for
she
knew
that
the
man
was
not
given
to
excess
in
liquor
but
as
he
approached
his
own
house
he
bethought
himself
that
it
would
not
lead
to
domestic
comfort
if
he
were
seen
returning
from
his
walk
with
mary
and
he
had
therefore
made
some
excuse
as
to
the
expediency
of
saying
a
word
to
runciman
whom
he
espied
at
his
own
door
he
said
his
word
to
runciman
and
so
loitered
away
perhaps
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
then
went
back
to
his
office
but
his
wife
had
kept
her
anger
at
burning
heat
and
pounced
upon
him
before
he
had
taken
his
seat
sundown
was
there
copying
sitting
with
his
eyes
intent
on
the
board
before
him
as
though
he
were
quite
unaware
of
the
sudden
entrance
of
his
master
wife
she
in
her
fury
did
not
regard
sundown
in
the
least
but
at
once
commenced
her
attack
what
is
all
this
masters
she
said
about
lady
ushant
and
going
to
cheltenham
i
wo
have
any
going
to
cheltenham
and
that
flat
now
the
attorney
had
altogether
made
up
his
mind
that
his
daughter
should
go
to
cheltenham
if
her
friend
would
receive
her
whatever
might
be
the
consequences
they
must
be
borne
but
he
thought
it
best
to
say
nothing
at
the
first
moment
of
the
attack
and
simply
turned
his
sorrowful
round
face
in
silence
up
to
the
partner
of
all
his
cares
and
the
source
of
so
many
of
them
there
have
been
letters
continued
the
lady
letters
which
nobody
has
told
me
nothing
about
that
proud
peacock
from
hoppet
hall
has
been
here
as
though
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
carry
mary
away
about
the
country
just
as
he
pleased
mary
wo
go
to
cheltenham
with
him
nor
yet
without
him
not
if
i
am
to
remain
here
where
else
should
you
remain
my
dear
asked
the
attorney
i
sooner
go
into
the
workhouse
than
have
all
this
turmoil
where
we
are
all
likely
to
go
if
you
pass
your
time
between
walking
about
with
that
minx
and
the
opposite
then
the
attorney
was
aware
that
he
had
been
watched
and
his
spirit
began
to
rise
within
him
he
looked
at
sundown
but
the
man
went
on
copying
quicker
than
ever
my
dear
said
masters
you
should
talk
in
that
way
before
the
clerk
i
wanted
to
speak
to
runciman
and
as
to
the
workhouse
i
do
know
that
there
is
any
more
danger
now
than
there
has
been
for
the
last
twenty
years
it
always
off
and
on
as
far
as
i
can
see
do
you
mean
to
send
that
girl
to
cheltenham
i
rather
think
she
had
better
go
for
a
time
then
i
shall
leave
this
house
and
go
with
my
girls
to
norrington
now
this
threat
which
had
been
made
before
was
quite
without
meaning
masters
parents
were
both
dead
and
her
brother
who
had
a
large
family
certainly
would
not
receive
her
i
wo
remain
here
masters
if
i
ai
to
be
mistress
of
my
own
house
what
is
she
to
go
to
cheltenham
for
i
should
like
to
know
then
sundown
was
desired
by
his
wretched
employer
to
go
into
the
back
settlement
and
the
poor
man
prepared
himself
for
the
battle
as
well
as
he
could
she
is
not
happy
here
he
said
whose
fault
is
that
why
should
she
be
happy
of
course
you
know
what
it
means
she
has
got
round
you
because
she
wants
to
be
a
fine
lady
what
means
have
you
to
make
her
a
fine
lady
if
you
was
to
die
what
would
there
be
for
any
of
my
little
bit
of
money
is
all
gone
let
her
stay
here
and
be
made
to
marry
lawrence
twentyman
that
what
i
say
she
will
never
marry
mr
twentyman
not
if
you
go
on
like
this
she
wo
if
you
done
your
duty
by
her
like
a
real
father
instead
of
being
afraid
of
her
when
she
puts
on
her
tantrums
she
have
been
at
chowton
farm
by
this
time
it
was
clear
to
him
that
now
was
the
time
not
to
be
afraid
of
his
wife
when
she
put
on
her
tantrums
or
at
any
rate
to
appear
not
to
be
afraid
she
has
been
very
unhappy
of
late
oh
unhappy
she
been
made
more
of
than
anybody
else
in
this
house
and
a
change
will
do
her
good
she
has
my
permission
to
go
and
go
she
shall
then
the
word
had
been
spoken
she
shall
it
is
very
much
for
the
best
while
she
is
here
the
house
is
made
wretched
for
us
all
it
be
wretcheder
yet
unless
it
would
make
you
happy
to
see
me
dead
on
the
threshold
which
i
believe
it
would
as
for
her
an
ungrateful
sly
wicked
slut
she
has
done
nothing
wicked
that
i
know
of
not
writing
to
that
old
woman
behind
my
back
she
told
me
what
she
was
doing
and
showed
me
the
letter
yes
of
course
the
two
of
you
were
in
it
does
that
make
it
any
better
i
say
it
was
sly
and
wicked
and
you
were
sly
and
wicked
as
well
as
she
she
has
got
the
better
of
you
and
now
you
are
going
to
send
her
away
from
the
only
chance
she
ever
get
of
having
a
decent
home
of
her
own
over
her
head
there
nothing
more
to
be
said
about
it
my
dear
she
go
to
lady
ushant
having
thus
pronounced
his
dictum
with
all
the
marital
authority
he
was
able
to
assume
he
took
his
hat
and
sallied
forth
masters
when
she
was
left
alone
stamped
her
foot
and
hit
the
desk
with
a
ruler
that
was
lying
there
then
she
went
and
threw
herself
on
her
bed
in
a
paroxysm
of
weeping
and
wailing
masters
when
he
closed
his
door
looked
up
the
street
and
down
the
street
and
then
again
went
across
to
the
bush
runciman
was
still
there
and
was
standing
with
a
letter
in
his
hand
while
one
of
the
grooms
from
rufford
hall
was
holding
a
horse
beside
him
any
answer
mr
runciman
said
the
groom
only
to
tell
his
lordship
that
everything
will
be
ready
for
him
you
better
go
through
and
give
the
horse
a
feed
of
corn
and
get
a
bit
of
something
to
eat
and
a
glass
of
beer
yourself
the
man
was
slow
to
do
as
he
was
bid
and
in
this
way
the
bush
had
become
very
popular
with
the
servants
of
the
gentry
around
the
place
his
lordship
is
to
be
here
from
friday
to
sunday
with
a
party
mr
masters
oh
indeed
for
the
end
of
the
shooting
and
who
do
you
think
he
has
asked
to
be
one
of
the
party
not
mr
reginald
i
do
think
they
ever
spoke
in
their
lives
who
but
larry
twentyman
no
it
be
the
making
of
larry
i
only
hope
he
wo
cock
his
beaver
too
high
is
he
coming
i
suppose
so
he
be
sure
to
come
his
lordship
only
tells
me
that
there
are
to
be
six
of
on
saturday
and
five
on
friday
night
but
the
lad
there
knew
who
they
all
were
there
surbiton
and
captain
battersby
and
sir
george
are
to
come
over
with
his
lordship
from
rufford
and
young
hampton
is
to
join
them
here
and
larry
twentyman
is
to
shoot
with
them
on
saturday
and
dine
afterwards
wo
those
two
botseys
be
jealous
that
all
it
only
shows
what
they
think
of
larry
said
the
attorney
larry
twentyman
is
a
very
good
fellow
said
the
landlord
i
know
a
better
fellow
round
dillsborough
or
one
who
is
more
always
on
the
square
but
he
weak
you
know
him
as
well
as
i
mr
masters
he
not
so
weak
but
what
he
can
keep
what
he
got
this
be
the
way
to
try
him
he
melt
away
like
water
into
sand
if
he
were
to
live
for
a
few
weeks
with
such
men
as
his
friends
i
suppose
there
no
chance
of
his
taking
a
wife
home
to
chowton
with
him
the
attorney
shook
his
head
that
be
the
making
of
him
masters
a
good
girl
like
that
who
keep
him
at
home
if
he
takes
it
to
heart
he
burst
out
somewhere
and
spend
a
lot
of
money
the
attorney
declined
runciman
offer
of
a
glass
of
beer
and
slowly
made
his
way
round
the
corner
of
the
inn
by
hobb
gate
to
the
front
door
of
hoppet
hall
then
he
passed
on
to
the
churchyard
still
thinking
of
the
misery
of
his
position
when
he
reached
the
church
he
turned
back
still
going
very
slowly
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
hoppet
hall
he
was
shown
at
once
by
reginald
old
housekeeper
up
to
the
library
and
there
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
joined
by
the
master
of
the
house
i
was
over
looking
for
you
an
hour
or
two
ago
said
reginald
i
heard
you
were
there
morton
and
so
i
thought
i
would
come
to
you
you
did
see
mary
i
just
saw
her
but
could
hardly
say
much
she
had
written
to
my
aunt
about
going
to
cheltenham
i
saw
the
letter
before
she
sent
it
mr
morton
so
she
told
me
my
aunt
would
be
delighted
to
have
her
but
it
seems
that
masters
does
not
wish
her
to
go
there
is
some
trouble
about
it
morton
but
i
may
as
well
tell
you
at
once
that
i
wish
her
to
go
she
would
be
better
for
awhile
at
cheltenham
with
such
a
lady
as
your
aunt
than
she
can
be
at
home
her
stepmother
and
she
can
not
agree
on
a
certain
point
i
dare
say
you
know
what
it
is
mr
morton
in
regard
i
suppose
to
mr
twentyman
just
that
masters
thinks
that
twentyman
would
make
an
excellent
husband
and
so
do
i
there
nothing
in
the
world
against
him
and
as
compared
with
me
he
a
rich
man
i
could
give
the
poor
girl
any
fortune
and
he
would
want
any
but
money
everything
no
indeed
he
an
industrious
steady
young
man
too
and
he
has
had
my
word
with
him
all
through
but
i
ca
compel
my
girl
to
marry
him
if
she
do
like
him
i
ca
even
try
to
compel
her
she
as
good
a
girl
as
ever
stirred
about
a
house
i
can
well
believe
that
and
nothing
would
take
such
a
load
off
me
as
to
know
that
she
was
going
to
be
well
married
but
as
she
do
like
the
young
man
well
enough
i
wo
have
her
hardly
used
masters
perhaps
is
hard
to
her
god
forbid
i
should
say
anything
against
my
wife
i
never
did
and
i
wo
now
but
mary
will
be
better
away
and
if
lady
ushant
will
be
good
enough
to
take
her
she
shall
go
when
will
she
be
ready
mr
masters
i
must
ask
her
about
that
in
a
week
perhaps
or
ten
days
she
is
quite
decided
against
the
young
man
quite
at
the
bidding
of
all
of
us
she
said
she
take
two
months
to
think
of
it
but
before
the
time
was
up
she
wrote
to
him
to
say
it
could
never
be
it
quite
upset
my
wife
because
it
would
have
been
such
an
excellent
arrangement
reginald
wished
to
learn
more
but
hardly
knew
how
to
ask
the
father
questions
yet
as
he
had
been
trusted
so
far
he
thought
that
he
might
be
trusted
altogether
i
must
own
he
said
that
i
think
that
twentyman
would
hardly
be
a
fit
husband
for
your
daughter
he
is
a
very
good
young
man
very
likely
but
she
is
something
more
than
a
very
good
young
woman
a
young
lady
with
her
gifts
will
be
sure
to
settle
well
in
life
some
day
the
attorney
shook
his
head
he
had
lived
long
enough
to
see
many
young
ladies
with
good
gifts
find
it
difficult
to
settle
in
life
and
perhaps
that
mysterious
poem
which
reginald
found
in
mary
eyes
was
neither
visible
nor
audible
to
mary
father
i
did
hear
said
reginald
that
surtees
there
nothing
in
that
oh
indeed
i
thought
that
perhaps
as
she
is
so
determined
not
to
do
as
her
friends
would
wish
that
there
might
be
something
else
he
said
this
almost
as
a
question
looking
close
into
the
eyes
as
he
spoke
it
is
always
possible
said
masters
but
you
do
think
there
is
anybody
it
is
very
hard
to
say
mr
morton
you
do
expect
anything
of
that
sort
then
the
attorney
broke
forth
into
sudden
confidence
to
tell
the
truth
then
morton
i
think
there
is
somebody
though
who
it
is
i
know
as
little
as
the
baby
unborn
she
sees
nobody
here
at
dillsborough
to
be
intimate
with
she
is
one
of
those
who
would
write
letters
or
do
anything
on
the
sly
but
there
is
some
one
she
told
me
as
much
herself
that
is
when
i
asked
her
she
would
not
deny
it
then
i
thought
that
perhaps
it
might
be
somebody
at
cheltenham
i
think
not
she
was
there
so
short
a
time
morton
and
lady
ushant
would
be
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
let
such
a
thing
as
that
go
on
without
telling
her
parents
i
do
think
there
was
any
one
at
cheltenham
she
was
only
there
a
month
i
did
fancy
that
perhaps
that
was
one
reason
why
she
should
want
to
go
back
i
do
believe
it
i
do
in
the
least
believe
it
said
reginald
enthusiastically
my
aunt
would
have
been
sure
to
have
seen
it
it
would
have
been
impossible
without
her
knowledge
but
there
is
somebody
i
think
so
morton
and
if
she
does
go
to
cheltenham
perhaps
lady
ushant
had
better
know
to
this
reginald
agreed
or
half
agreed
it
did
not
seem
to
him
to
be
of
much
consequence
what
might
be
done
at
cheltenham
he
felt
certain
that
the
lover
was
not
there
and
yet
who
was
there
at
dillsborough
he
had
seen
those
young
botseys
about
could
it
possibly
be
one
of
them
and
during
the
christmas
vacation
the
rector
scamp
of
a
son
had
been
home
from
oxford
to
whom
mary
masters
had
barely
spoken
was
it
young
mainwaring
or
could
it
be
possible
that
she
had
turned
an
eye
of
favour
on
nupper
assistant
there
was
nothing
too
monstrous
for
him
to
suggest
to
himself
as
soon
as
the
attorney
had
left
him
but
there
was
a
young
man
in
dillsborough
one
man
at
any
rate
young
enough
to
be
a
lover
of
whom
reginald
did
not
think
as
to
whom
had
his
name
been
suggested
as
that
of
the
young
man
to
whom
heart
had
been
given
he
would
have
repudiated
such
a
suggestion
with
astonishment
and
anger
but
now
having
heard
this
from
the
father
he
was
again
vexed
and
almost
as
much
disgusted
as
when
he
had
first
become
aware
that
larry
twentyman
was
a
suitor
for
her
hand
why
should
he
trouble
himself
about
a
girl
who
was
ready
to
fall
in
love
with
the
first
man
that
she
saw
about
the
place
he
tried
to
pacify
himself
by
some
such
question
as
this
but
tried
in
vain
chapter
xxi
the
dinner
at
the
bush
here
is
the
letter
which
at
his
advice
lord
rufford
wrote
to
arabella
rufford
february
my
dear
miss
trefoil
it
is
a
great
grief
to
me
that
i
should
have
to
answer
your
letter
in
a
manner
that
will
i
fear
not
be
satisfactory
to
you
i
can
only
say
that
you
have
altogether
mistaken
me
if
you
think
that
i
have
said
anything
which
was
intended
as
an
offer
of
marriage
i
can
not
but
be
much
flattered
by
your
good
opinion
i
have
had
much
pleasure
from
our
acquaintance
and
i
should
have
been
glad
if
it
could
have
been
continued
but
i
have
had
no
thoughts
of
marriage
if
i
have
said
a
word
which
has
unintentionally
on
my
part
given
rise
to
such
an
idea
i
can
only
beg
your
pardon
heartily
if
i
were
to
add
more
after
what
i
have
now
said
perhaps
you
would
take
it
as
an
impertinence
yours
most
sincerely
rufford
he
had
desired
to
make
various
additions
and
suggestions
which
however
had
all
been
disallowed
by
sir
george
penwether
he
had
proposed
among
other
things
to
ask
her
whether
he
should
keep
jack
for
her
for
the
remainder
of
the
season
or
whether
he
should
send
the
horse
elsewhere
but
sir
george
would
not
allow
a
word
in
the
letter
about
jack
you
did
give
her
the
horse
then
he
asked
i
had
hardly
any
alternative
as
the
things
went
she
would
have
been
quite
welcome
to
the
horse
if
she
would
have
let
me
alone
afterwards
no
doubt
but
when
young
gentlemen
give
young
ladies
horses
i
know
all
about
it
my
dear
fellow
pray
do
preach
more
than
you
can
help
of
course
i
have
been
an
infernal
ass
i
know
all
that
but
as
the
horse
is
hers
say
nothing
about
the
horse
were
she
to
ask
for
it
of
course
she
could
have
it
but
that
is
not
likely
and
you
think
i
had
better
say
nothing
else
not
a
word
of
course
it
will
be
shown
to
all
her
friends
and
may
possibly
find
its
way
into
print
i
do
know
what
steps
such
a
young
lady
may
be
advised
to
take
her
uncle

a
man
of
honour

is
an
ass
and
careless
about
everything
mistletoe
will
not
improbably
feel
himself
bound
to
act
as
though
he
were
her
brother
they
will
of
course
all
think
you
to
be
a
rascal
and
will
say
so
if
mistletoe
says
so
i
horsewhip
him
no
you
wo
rufford
you
will
remember
that
this
woman
is
a
woman
and
that
a
woman
friends
are
bound
to
stand
up
for
her
after
all
your
hands
are
not
quite
clean
in
the
matter
i
am
heavy
enough
on
myself
penwether
i
have
been
a
fool
and
i
own
it
but
i
have
done
nothing
unbecoming
a
gentleman
he
was
almost
tempted
to
quarrel
with
his
but
at
last
he
allowed
the
letter
to
be
sent
just
as
sir
george
had
written
it
and
then
tried
to
banish
the
affair
from
his
mind
for
the
present
so
that
he
might
enjoy
his
life
till
the
next
hostile
step
should
be
taken
by
the
trefoil
clan
when
larry
twentyman
received
the
lord
note
which
was
left
at
chowton
farm
by
hampton
groom
he
was
in
the
lowest
depth
of
desolation
he
had
intended
to
hunt
that
day
in
compliance
with
john
morton
advice
but
had
felt
himself
quite
unable
to
make
the
effort
it
was
not
only
that
he
had
been
thrown
over
by
mary
masters
but
that
everybody
knew
that
he
had
been
thrown
over
if
he
had
kept
the
matter
secret
perhaps
he
might
have
borne
it
but
it
is
so
hard
to
bear
a
sorrow
of
which
all
one
neighbours
are
conscious
when
a
man
is
reduced
by
poverty
to
the
drinking
of
beer
instead
of
wine
it
is
not
the
loss
of
the
wine
that
is
so
heavy
on
him
as
the
consciousness
that
those
around
him
are
aware
of
the
reason
and
he
is
apt
to
extend
his
idea
of
this
consciousness
to
a
circle
that
is
altogether
indifferent
of
the
fact
that
a
man
should
fail
in
his
love
seems
to
him
to
be
of
all
failures
the
most
contemptible
and
larry
thought
that
there
would
not
be
one
in
the
field
unaware
of
his
miserable
rejection
in
spite
of
his
mother
prayers
he
had
refused
to
go
and
had
hung
about
the
farm
all
day
then
there
came
to
him
lord
rufford
note
it
had
been
quite
unexpected
and
a
month
or
two
before
when
his
hopes
had
still
been
high
in
regard
to
mary
masters
would
have
filled
him
with
delight
it
was
the
foible
of
his
life
to
be
esteemed
a
gentleman
and
his
poor
ambition
to
be
allowed
to
live
among
men
of
higher
social
standing
than
himself
those
dinners
of
lord
rufford
at
the
bush
had
been
a
special
grief
to
him
the
young
lord
had
been
always
courteous
to
him
in
the
field
and
he
had
been
able
as
he
thought
to
requite
such
courtesy
by
little
attentions
in
the
way
of
game
preserving
if
pheasants
from
dillsborough
wood
ate
goarly
wheat
so
did
they
eat
larry
twentyman
barley
he
had
a
sportsman
heart
above
complaint
as
to
such
matters
and
had
always
been
neighbourly
to
the
lord
no
doubt
pheasants
and
hares
were
left
at
his
house
whenever
there
was
shooting
in
the
neighbourhood
which
to
his
mother
afforded
great
consolation
but
larry
did
not
care
for
the
pheasants
and
hares
had
he
so
pleased
he
could
have
shot
them
on
his
own
land
but
he
did
not
preserve
and
as
a
good
neighbour
he
regarded
the
pheasants
and
hares
as
lord
rufford
property
he
felt
that
he
was
behaving
as
a
gentleman
as
well
as
a
neighbour
and
that
he
should
be
treated
as
such
fred
botsey
had
dined
at
the
bush
with
lord
rufford
and
larry
looked
on
fred
as
in
no
way
better
than
himself
now
at
last
the
invitation
had
come
he
was
asked
to
a
day
shooting
and
to
dine
with
the
lord
and
his
party
at
the
inn
how
pleasant
would
it
be
to
give
a
friendly
nod
to
runciman
as
he
went
into
the
room
and
to
assert
afterwards
in
botsey
hearing
something
of
the
joviality
of
the
evening
of
course
hampton
would
be
there
as
hampton
servant
had
brought
the
note
and
he
was
very
anxious
to
be
on
friendly
terms
with
hampton
next
to
the
lord
himself
there
was
no
one
in
the
hunt
who
carried
his
head
so
high
as
young
hampton
but
there
arose
to
him
the
question
whether
all
this
had
not
arrived
too
late
of
what
good
is
it
to
open
up
the
true
delights
of
life
to
a
man
when
you
have
so
scotched
and
wounded
him
that
he
has
no
capability
left
of
enjoying
anything
as
he
sat
lonely
with
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
he
thought
for
a
while
that
he
would
decline
the
invitation
the
idea
of
selling
chowton
farm
and
of
establishing
himself
at
some
antipodes
in
which
the
name
of
mary
masters
should
never
have
been
heard
was
growing
upon
him
of
what
use
would
the
friendship
of
lord
rufford
be
to
him
at
the
other
side
of
the
globe
at
last
however
the
hope
of
giving
that
friendly
nod
to
runciman
overcame
him
and
he
determined
to
go
he
wrote
a
note
which
caused
him
no
little
thought
presenting
his
compliments
to
lord
rufford
and
promising
to
meet
his
lordship
party
at
dillsborough
wood
the
shooting
went
off
very
well
and
larry
behaved
himself
with
propriety
he
wanted
the
party
to
come
in
and
lunch
and
had
given
sundry
instructions
to
his
mother
on
that
head
but
they
did
not
remain
near
to
his
place
throughout
the
day
and
his
efforts
in
that
direction
were
not
successful
between
five
and
six
he
went
home
and
at
seven
appeared
at
the
bush
attired
in
his
best
he
never
yet
had
sat
down
with
a
lord
and
his
mind
misgave
him
a
little
but
he
had
spirit
enough
to
look
about
for
runciman
who
however
was
not
to
be
seen
sir
george
was
not
there
but
the
party
had
been
made
up
as
regarded
the
dinner
by
the
addition
of
captain
glomax
who
had
returned
from
hunting
captain
glomax
was
in
high
glee
having
had
as
he
declared
the
run
of
the
season
when
a
master
has
been
deserted
on
any
day
by
the
choice
spirits
of
his
hunt
he
is
always
apt
to
boast
to
them
that
he
had
on
that
occasion
the
run
of
the
season
he
had
taken
a
fox
from
impington
right
across
to
hogsborough
which
as
every
one
knows
is
just
on
the
borders
of
the
had
then
run
him
for
five
miles
into
lord
chiltern
country
and
had
killed
him
in
the
centre
of
the
brake
hunt
after
an
hour
and
a
half
almost
without
a
check
it
was
one
of
those
straight
things
that
one
does
often
see
said
glomax
any
pace
asked
lord
rufford
very
good
indeed
for
the
first
forty
minutes
i
wish
you
had
all
been
there
it
was
better
fun
i
take
it
than
shooting
rabbits
then
hampton
put
the
captain
through
his
facings
as
to
time
and
distance
and
exact
places
that
had
been
passed
and
ended
by
expressing
an
opinion
that
he
could
have
kicked
his
hat
as
fast
on
foot
whereupon
the
captain
begged
him
to
try
and
hinted
that
he
did
not
know
the
country
in
answer
to
which
hampton
offered
to
bet
a
note
that
young
jack
runce
would
say
that
the
pace
had
been
slow
jack
was
the
son
of
the
old
farmer
whom
the
senator
had
so
disgusted
and
was
supposed
to
know
what
he
was
about
on
a
horse
but
glomax
declined
the
bet
saying
that
he
did
not
care
a
for
jack
runce
he
knew
as
much
about
pace
as
any
farmer
or
for
the
matter
of
that
any
gentleman
in
ufford
or
rufford
and
the
pace
for
forty
minutes
had
been
very
good
nevertheless
all
the
party
were
convinced
that
the
thing
had
been
so
slow
that
it
had
not
been
worth
riding
to
a
conviction
which
is
not
uncommon
with
gentlemen
when
they
have
missed
a
run
in
all
this
discussion
poor
larry
took
no
great
part
though
he
knew
the
country
as
well
as
any
one
larry
had
not
as
yet
got
over
the
awe
inspired
by
the
lord
in
his
black
coat
perhaps
larry
happiest
moment
in
the
evening
was
when
runciman
himself
brought
in
the
soup
for
at
that
moment
lord
rufford
put
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
desired
him
to
sit
down
and
runciman
both
heard
and
saw
it
and
at
dinner
when
the
champagne
had
been
twice
round
he
became
more
comfortable
the
conversation
got
upon
goarly
and
in
reference
to
that
matter
he
was
quite
at
home
it
not
my
doing
said
lord
rufford
i
have
instructed
no
one
to
keep
him
locked
up
it
a
very
good
job
from
all
that
i
can
hear
said
tom
surbiton
all
i
did
was
to
get
masters
here
to
take
up
the
case
for
me
and
i
learned
from
him
that
the
rascal
had
already
agreed
to
take
the
money
i
offered
he
only
bargains
that
it
shall
be
paid
into
his
own
hands
no
doubt
desiring
to
sell
the
attorney
he
has
employed
bearside
has
got
his
money
from
the
american
senator
my
lord
said
larry
they
may
fight
it
out
among
them
i
do
care
who
gets
the
money
or
who
pays
it
as
long
as
i
not
imposed
upon
we
must
proceed
against
that
man
scrobby
said
glomax
with
all
the
authority
of
a
master
you
never
convict
him
on
goarly
evidence
said
the
lord
then
larry
could
give
them
further
information
nickem
had
positively
traced
the
purchase
of
the
red
herrings
an
old
woman
in
rufford
was
ready
to
swear
that
she
herself
had
sold
them
to
scrobby
tom
surbiton
suggested
that
the
possession
of
red
herrings
was
not
of
itself
a
crime
hampton
thought
that
it
was
corroborative
captain
battersby
wanted
to
know
whether
any
of
the
herrings
were
still
in
existence
so
that
they
could
be
sworn
to
glomax
was
of
opinion
that
villainy
of
so
deep
a
dye
could
not
have
taken
place
in
any
other
hunting
country
in
england
there
been
strychnine
put
down
in
the
brake
too
said
hampton
but
not
in
cartloads
said
the
master
i
rather
think
said
larry
that
nickem
knows
where
the
strychnine
was
bought
that
make
a
clear
case
of
it
hanging
would
be
too
good
for
such
a
scoundrel
this
was
said
after
the
third
glass
of
champagne
but
the
opinion
was
one
which
was
well
received
by
the
whole
company
after
that
the
senator
conduct
was
discussed
and
they
all
agreed
that
in
the
whole
affair
that
was
the
most
marvellous
circumstance
they
must
be
queer
people
over
there
said
larry
brutes
said
glomax
they
once
tried
a
pack
of
hounds
somewhere
in
one
of
the
states
but
they
never
could
run
a
yard
there
was
a
good
deal
of
wine
drank
which
was
not
unusual
at
lord
rufford
dinners
most
of
the
company
were
seasoned
vessels
and
none
of
them
were
much
the
worse
for
what
they
drank
but
the
generous
wine
got
to
larry
heart
and
perhaps
made
his
brain
a
little
soft
lord
rufford
remembering
what
had
been
said
about
the
young
man
misery
tried
to
console
him
by
attention
and
as
the
evening
wore
on
and
when
the
second
cigars
had
been
lit
all
round
the
two
were
seated
together
in
confidential
conversation
at
a
corner
of
the
table
yes
my
lord
i
think
i
shall
hook
it
said
larry
something
has
occurred
that
has
made
the
place
not
quite
so
comfortable
to
me
and
as
it
is
all
my
own
i
think
i
shall
sell
it
we
should
miss
you
immensely
in
the
hunt
said
lord
rufford
who
of
course
knew
what
the
something
was
it
very
kind
of
you
to
say
so
my
lord
but
there
are
things
which
may
make
a
man
go
nothing
serious
i
hope
just
a
young
woman
my
lord
i
do
want
it
talked
about
but
i
do
mind
mentioning
it
to
you
you
should
never
let
those
troubles
touch
you
so
closely
said
his
lordship
whose
own
withers
at
this
moment
were
by
no
means
unwrung
i
dare
say
not
but
if
you
feel
it
how
are
you
to
help
it
i
shall
do
very
well
when
i
get
away
chowton
farm
is
not
the
only
spot
in
the
world
but
a
man
so
fond
of
hunting
as
you
are
well
yes
i
shall
miss
the
hunting
my
lord
sha
i
if
morton
do
buy
the
place
i
should
like
it
to
go
to
your
lordship
i
offered
it
to
him
first
because
it
came
from
them
quite
right
i
hear
that
morton
is
very
so
i
heard
said
larry
nupper
has
been
with
him
i
know
and
i
fancy
they
have
sent
for
somebody
from
london
i
do
know
that
he
cares
much
about
the
land
he
thinks
more
of
the
foreign
parts
always
in
i
do
believe
we
should
fall
out
about
the
price
my
lord
then
lord
rufford
explained
that
he
would
not
go
into
that
matter
just
at
present
but
that
if
the
place
were
in
the
market
he
would
certainly
like
to
buy
it
he
however
did
as
john
morton
had
done
before
and
endeavoured
to
persuade
the
poor
fellow
that
he
should
not
alter
the
whole
tenor
of
his
life
because
a
young
lady
would
not
look
at
him
good
night
runciman
said
larry
as
he
made
his
way
to
the
yard
we
had
an
uncommon
pleasant
evening
i
glad
you
enjoyed
yourself
larry
larry
thought
that
his
christian
name
from
the
hotel
keeper
lips
had
never
sounded
so
offensively
as
on
the
present
occasion
chapter
xxii
miss
trefoil
decision
lord
rufford
letter
reached
arabella
at
her
cousin
house
in
due
course
and
was
handed
to
her
in
the
morning
as
she
came
down
to
breakfast
the
envelope
bore
his
crest
and
coronet
and
she
was
sure
that
more
than
one
pair
of
eyes
had
already
seen
it
her
mother
had
been
in
the
room
some
time
before
her
and
would
of
course
know
that
the
letter
was
from
lord
rufford
an
indiscreet
word
or
two
had
been
said
in
the
hearing
of
connop
green
as
to
which
arabella
had
already
scolded
her
mother
most
vehemently
and
connop
green
too
would
probably
have
seen
the
letter
and
would
know
that
it
had
come
from
the
lover
of
whom
boasts
had
been
made
the
connop
greens
would
be
ready
to
worship
arabella
down
to
the
very
soles
of
her
feet
if
she
were
certainly
without
a
vestige
of
doubt
engaged
to
be
the
wife
of
lord
rufford
but
there
had
been
so
many
previous
mistakes
and
they
too
had
heard
of
john
morton
they
too
were
a
little
afraid
of
arabella
though
she
was
undoubtedly
the
niece
of
a
duke
she
was
aware
now
as
always
how
much
depended
on
her
personal
bearing
but
this
was
a
moment
of
moments
she
would
fain
have
kept
the
letter
and
have
opened
it
in
the
retirement
of
her
own
room
she
knew
its
terrible
importance
and
was
afraid
of
her
own
countenance
when
she
should
read
it
all
the
hopes
of
her
life
were
contained
in
that
letter
but
were
she
to
put
it
in
her
pocket
she
would
betray
her
anxiety
by
doing
so
she
found
herself
bound
to
open
it
and
read
it
at
once
and
she
did
open
it
and
read
it
after
all
it
was
what
she
had
expected
it
was
very
decided
very
short
very
cold
and
carrying
with
it
no
sign
of
weakness
but
it
was
of
such
a
letter
that
she
had
thought
when
she
resolved
that
she
would
apply
to
lord
mistletoe
and
endeavour
to
put
the
whole
family
of
trefoil
in
arms
she
had
been
so
she
had
assured
herself
quite
sure
that
that
kind
loving
response
which
she
had
solicited
would
not
be
given
to
her
but
yet
the
stern
fact
now
that
it
was
absolutely
in
her
hands
almost
overwhelmed
her
she
could
not
restrain
the
dull
dead
look
of
sorrow
which
for
a
few
moments
clouded
her
face
a
look
which
took
away
all
her
beauty
lengthening
her
cheeks
and
robbing
her
eyes
of
that
vivacity
which
it
was
the
task
of
her
life
to
assume
is
anything
the
matter
my
dear
asked
connop
green
then
she
made
a
final
effort
an
heroic
effort
what
do
you
think
mamma
she
said
paying
no
attention
to
her
cousin
inquiry
what
is
it
arabella
jack
got
some
injury
that
day
at
peltry
and
is
so
lame
that
they
do
know
whether
he
ever
put
his
foot
to
the
ground
again
poor
fellow
said
green
who
is
jack
jack
is
a
horse
green
and
such
a
horse
that
one
can
not
but
be
sorry
for
him
poor
jack
i
do
know
any
christian
whose
lameness
would
be
such
a
nuisance
does
lord
rufford
write
about
his
horses
asked
connop
green
thus
betraying
that
knowledge
as
to
the
letter
which
she
had
obtained
from
the
envelope
if
you
must
know
all
the
truth
about
it
said
arabella
the
horse
is
my
horse
and
not
lord
rufford
and
as
he
is
the
only
horse
i
have
got
and
as
he
the
dearest
horse
in
all
the
world
you
must
excuse
my
being
a
little
sorry
about
him
poor
jack
after
that
the
breakfast
was
eaten
and
everybody
in
the
room
believed
the
story
of
the
horse
lameness
except
lady
augustus
when
breakfast
and
the
loitering
after
breakfast
were
well
over
so
that
she
could
escape
without
exciting
any
notice
she
made
her
way
up
to
her
bedroom
in
a
few
minutes
so
that
again
there
should
be
nothing
noticeable
her
mother
followed
her
but
her
door
was
locked
it
is
i
arabella
said
her
mother
you
ca
come
in
at
present
mamma
i
am
busy
but
arabella
you
ca
come
in
at
present
mamma
then
lady
augustus
slowly
glided
away
to
her
own
room
and
there
waited
for
tidings
the
whole
form
of
the
girl
face
was
altered
when
she
was
alone
her
features
in
themselves
were
not
lovely
her
cheeks
and
chin
were
heavy
her
brow
was
too
low
and
her
upper
lip
too
long
her
nose
and
teeth
were
good
and
would
have
been
very
handsome
had
they
belonged
to
a
man
her
complexion
had
always
been
good
till
it
had
been
injured
by
being
improved
and
so
was
the
carriage
of
her
head
and
the
outside
lines
of
her
bust
and
figure
and
her
large
eyes
though
never
soft
could
be
bright
and
sparkle
skill
had
done
much
for
her
and
continued
effort
almost
more
but
now
the
effort
was
dropped
and
that
which
skill
had
done
turned
against
her
she
was
haggard
lumpy
and
almost
hideous
in
her
bewildered
grief
had
there
been
a
word
of
weakness
in
the
short
letter
she
might
have
founded
upon
it
some
hope
it
did
not
occur
to
her
that
he
had
had
the
letter
written
for
him
and
she
was
astonished
at
its
curt
strength
how
could
he
dare
to
say
that
she
had
mistaken
him
had
she
not
lain
in
his
arms
while
he
embraced
her
how
could
he
have
found
the
courage
to
say
that
he
had
had
no
thought
of
marriage
when
he
had
declared
to
her
that
he
loved
her
she
must
have
known
that
she
had
hunted
him
as
a
fox
is
hunted
and
yet
she
believed
that
she
was
being
cruelly
for
a
time
all
that
dependence
on
lord
mistletoe
and
her
uncle
deserted
her
what
effect
could
they
have
on
a
man
who
would
write
such
a
letter
as
that
had
she
known
that
the
words
were
the
words
of
his
even
that
would
have
given
her
some
hope
but
what
should
she
do
whatever
steps
she
took
she
must
take
at
once
and
she
must
tell
her
mother
her
mother
help
would
be
necessary
to
her
now
in
whatever
direction
she
might
turn
her
mind
she
almost
thought
that
she
would
abandon
him
without
another
word
she
had
been
strong
in
her
reliance
on
family
aid
till
the
time
for
invoking
it
had
come
but
now
she
believed
that
it
would
be
useless
could
it
be
that
such
a
man
as
this
would
be
driven
into
marriage
by
the
interference
of
lord
mistletoe
she
would
much
like
to
bring
down
some
punishment
on
his
head
but
in
doing
so
she
would
cut
all
other
ground
from
under
her
own
feet
there
were
still
open
to
her
patagonia
and
the
paragon
she
hated
the
paragon
and
she
recoiled
with
shuddering
from
the
idea
of
patagonia
but
as
for
hating
she
hated
lord
rufford
most
and
what
was
there
that
she
loved
she
tried
to
ask
herself
some
question
even
as
to
that
there
certainly
was
no
man
for
whom
she
cared
a
straw
nor
had
there
been
for
the
last
six
or
eight
years
even
when
he
was
kissing
her
she
was
thinking
of
her
hair
of
her
pearl
powder
her
paint
and
of
possible
accidents
and
untoward
revelations
the
loan
of
her
lips
had
been
for
use
only
and
not
for
any
pleasure
which
she
had
even
in
pleasing
him
in
her
very
swoon
she
had
felt
the
need
of
being
careful
at
all
points
it
was
all
labour
and
all
care
and
alas
alas
all
disappointment
but
there
was
a
future
through
which
she
must
live
how
might
she
best
avoid
the
misfortune
of
poverty
for
the
twenty
thirty
or
forty
years
which
might
be
accorded
to
her
what
did
it
matter
whom
or
what
she
hated
the
housemaid
probably
did
not
like
cleaning
grates
nor
the
butcher
killing
sheep
nor
the
sempstress
stitching
silks
she
must
live
and
if
she
could
only
get
away
from
her
mother
that
in
itself
would
be
something
most
people
were
distasteful
to
her
but
no
one
so
much
as
her
mother
here
in
england
she
knew
that
she
was
despised
among
the
people
with
whom
she
lived
and
now
she
would
be
more
despised
than
ever
her
uncle
and
aunt
though
she
disliked
them
had
been
much
to
her
it
was
something
that
annual
visit
to
mistletoe
though
she
never
enjoyed
it
when
she
was
there
but
she
could
well
understand
that
after
such
a
failure
as
this
after
such
a
game
played
before
their
own
eyes
in
their
own
house
her
uncle
and
her
aunt
would
drop
her
altogether
she
had
played
this
game
so
boldly
that
there
was
no
retreat
would
it
not
therefore
be
better
that
she
should
fly
altogether
there
was
a
time
on
that
morning
in
which
she
had
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
write
a
most
affectionate
letter
to
morton
telling
him
that
her
people
had
now
agreed
to
his
propositions
as
to
settlement
and
assuring
him
that
from
henceforward
she
would
be
all
his
own
she
did
think
that
were
she
to
do
so
she
might
still
go
with
him
to
patagonia
but
if
so
she
must
do
it
at
once
the
delay
had
already
been
almost
too
long
in
that
case
she
would
not
say
a
word
in
reply
to
lord
rufford
and
would
allow
all
that
to
be
as
though
it
had
never
been
then
again
there
arose
to
her
mind
the
remembrance
of
rufford
hall
of
all
the
glories
of
the
triumph
over
everybody
then
again
there
was
the
idea
of
a
forlorn
hope
she
thought
that
she
could
have
brought
herself
to
do
it
if
only
death
would
have
been
the
alternative
of
success
when
she
had
resolved
to
make
the
rush
it
was
nearly
one
when
she
went
to
her
mother
and
even
then
she
was
undecided
but
the
joint
agony
of
the
solitude
and
the
doubts
had
been
too
much
for
her
and
she
found
herself
constrained
to
seek
a
counsellor
he
has
thrown
you
over
said
lady
augustus
as
soon
as
the
door
was
closed
of
course
he
has
said
arabella
walking
up
the
room
and
again
playing
her
part
even
before
her
mother
i
knew
it
would
be
so
you
knew
nothing
of
the
kind
mamma
and
your
saying
so
is
simply
an
untruth
it
was
you
who
put
me
up
to
it
arabella
that
is
false
it
was
you
i
suppose
who
made
me
throw
over
morton
and
bragton
certainly
not
that
is
so
like
you
mamma
there
is
a
single
thing
that
you
do
or
say
that
you
do
deny
afterwards
these
little
compliments
were
so
usual
among
them
that
at
the
present
moment
they
excited
no
great
danger
there
his
letter
i
suppose
you
had
better
read
it
and
she
chucked
the
document
to
her
mother
it
is
very
decided
said
lady
augustus
it
is
the
falsest
the
most
impudent
and
the
most
scandalous
letter
that
a
man
ever
wrote
to
a
woman
i
could
horsewhip
him
for
it
myself
if
i
could
get
near
him
is
it
all
over
arabella
all
over
what
questions
you
do
ask
mamma
no
it
is
not
all
over
i
stick
to
him
like
a
leech
he
proposed
to
me
as
plainly
as
any
man
ever
did
to
any
woman
i
do
care
what
people
may
say
or
think
he
has
heard
the
last
of
me
and
so
he
find
and
thus
in
her
passion
she
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
not
yet
abandon
the
hunt
what
will
you
do
my
dear
what
will
i
do
how
am
i
to
say
what
i
will
do
if
i
were
standing
near
him
with
a
knife
in
my
hand
i
would
stick
it
into
his
heart
i
would
mistaken
him
liar
they
talk
of
girls
lying
but
what
girl
would
lie
like
that
but
something
must
be
done
if
papa
were
not
such
a
fool
as
he
is
he
could
manage
it
all
for
me
said
arabella
dutifully
i
must
see
my
father
and
i
must
dictate
a
letter
for
him
where
is
papa
in
london
i
suppose
you
must
come
up
to
london
with
me
we
shall
have
to
go
to
his
club
and
get
him
out
it
must
be
done
immediately
and
then
i
must
see
lord
mistletoe
and
i
will
write
to
the
duke
would
it
not
be
better
to
write
to
your
papa
said
lady
augustus
not
liking
the
idea
of
being
dragged
away
so
quickly
from
comfortable
quarters
no
it
would
if
you
wo
go
i
shall
and
you
must
give
me
some
money
i
shall
write
to
lord
rufford
too
and
so
it
was
at
last
decided
the
wretched
old
woman
being
dragged
away
up
to
london
on
some
excuse
which
the
connop
greens
were
not
sorry
to
accept
but
on
that
same
afternoon
arabella
wrote
to
lord
rufford
your
letter
has
amazed
me
i
can
not
understand
it
it
seems
to
be
almost
impossible
that
it
should
really
have
come
from
you
how
can
you
say
that
i
have
mistaken
you
there
has
been
no
mistake
surely
that
letter
can
not
have
been
written
by
you
of
course
i
have
been
obliged
to
tell
my
father
everything
arabella
on
the
following
day
at
about
four
in
the
afternoon
the
mother
and
daughter
drove
up
to
the
door
of
graham
club
in
bond
street
and
there
they
found
lord
augustus
with
considerable
difficulty
he
was
induced
to
come
down
from
the
whist
room
and
was
forced
into
the
brougham
he
was
a
handsome
fat
man
with
a
long
grey
beard
who
passed
his
whole
life
in
eating
drinking
and
playing
whist
and
was
troubled
by
no
scruples
and
no
principles
he
would
not
cheat
at
cards
because
it
was
dangerous
and
ungentlemanlike
and
if
discovered
would
lead
to
his
social
annihilation
but
as
to
paying
money
that
he
owed
to
tradesmen
it
never
occurred
to
him
as
being
a
desirable
thing
as
long
as
he
could
get
what
he
wanted
without
doing
so
he
had
expended
his
own
patrimony
and
his
wife
fortune
and
now
lived
on
an
allowance
made
to
him
by
his
brother
whatever
funds
his
wife
might
have
not
a
shilling
of
them
ever
came
from
him
when
he
began
to
understand
something
of
the
nature
of
the
business
on
hand
he
suggested
that
his
brother
the
duke
could
do
what
was
desirable
infinitely
better
than
he
could
he
wo
think
anything
of
me
said
lord
augustus
we
make
him
think
something
said
arabella
sternly
you
must
do
it
papa
they
turn
you
out
of
the
club
if
they
knew
that
you
had
refused
then
he
looked
up
in
the
brougham
and
snarled
at
her
papa
you
must
copy
the
letter
and
sign
it
how
am
i
to
know
the
truth
of
it
all
he
asked
it
is
quite
true
said
lady
augustus
there
was
very
much
more
of
it
but
at
last
he
was
carried
away
bodily
and
in
his
presence
he
did
write
and
sign
the
following
letter
my
lord
i
have
heard
from
my
daughter
a
story
which
has
surprised
me
very
much
it
appears
that
she
has
been
staying
with
you
at
rufford
hall
and
again
at
mistletoe
and
that
while
at
the
latter
place
you
proposed
marriage
to
her
she
tells
me
with
concern
that
you
have
now
repudiated
your
own
proposition
not
only
once
made
but
repeated
her
condition
is
most
distressing
she
is
in
all
respects
your
lordship
equal
as
her
father
i
am
driven
to
ask
you
what
excuse
you
have
to
make
or
whether
she
has
interpreted
you
aright
i
have
the
honour
to
be
your
very
humble
servant
augustus
trefoil
chapter
xxiii
in
these
days
one
ca
make
a
man
marry
this
was
going
on
while
lord
rufford
was
shooting
in
the
neighbourhood
of
dillsborough
and
when
the
letter
was
being
put
into
its
envelope
at
the
lodgings
in
orchard
street
his
lordship
was
just
sitting
down
to
dinner
with
his
guests
at
the
bush
at
the
same
time
john
morton
was
lying
ill
at
bragton
a
fact
of
which
arabella
was
not
aware
the
letter
from
lord
augustus
was
put
into
the
post
on
saturday
evening
but
when
that
line
of
action
was
decided
upon
by
arabella
she
was
aware
that
she
must
not
trust
solely
to
her
father
various
plans
were
fermenting
in
her
brain
all
or
any
of
which
if
carried
out
at
all
must
be
carried
out
at
the
same
time
and
at
once
there
must
be
no
delay
or
that
final
chance
of
patagonia
would
be
gone
the
leader
of
a
forlorn
hope
though
he
be
ever
so
resolved
to
die
in
the
breach
still
makes
some
preparation
for
his
escape
among
her
plans
the
first
in
order
was
a
resolution
to
see
lord
mistletoe
whom
she
knew
to
be
in
town
parliament
was
to
meet
in
the
course
of
the
next
week
and
he
was
to
move
the
address
there
had
been
much
said
about
all
this
at
mistletoe
from
which
she
knew
that
he
was
in
london
preparing
himself
among
the
gentlemen
at
the
treasury
then
she
herself
would
write
to
the
duke
she
thought
that
she
could
concoct
a
letter
that
would
move
even
his
heart
she
would
tell
him
that
she
was
a
daughter
of
the
house
of
trefoil
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
she
had
it
distinctly
laid
down
in
her
mind
and
then
there
was
another
move
which
she
would
make
before
she
altogether
threw
up
the
game
she
would
force
herself
into
lord
rufford
presence
and
throw
herself
into
his
arms
at
his
feet
if
need
be
and
force
him
into
compliance
should
she
fail
then
she
too
had
an
idea
what
a
raging
woman
could
do
but
her
first
step
now
must
be
with
her
cousin
mistletoe
she
would
not
write
to
the
duke
till
she
had
seen
her
cousin
lord
mistletoe
when
in
london
lived
at
the
family
house
in
piccadilly
and
thither
early
on
the
sunday
morning
she
sent
a
note
to
say
that
she
especially
wished
to
see
her
cousin
and
would
call
at
three
on
that
day
the
messenger
brought
back
word
that
lord
mistletoe
would
be
at
home
and
exactly
at
that
hour
the
hired
brougham
stopped
at
the
door
her
mother
had
wished
to
accompany
her
but
she
had
declared
that
if
she
could
not
go
alone
she
would
not
go
at
all
in
that
she
was
right
for
whatever
favour
the
young
heir
to
the
family
honours
might
retain
for
his
fair
cousin
who
was
at
any
rate
a
trefoil
he
had
none
for
his
uncle
wife
she
was
shown
into
his
own
on
the
ground
floor
and
then
he
immediately
joined
her
i
would
have
you
shown
upstairs
he
said
because
i
understand
from
your
note
that
you
want
to
see
me
in
particular
that
is
so
kind
of
you
lord
mistletoe
was
a
young
man
about
thirty
less
in
stature
than
his
father
or
uncle
but
with
the
same
handsome
inexpressive
face
almost
all
men
take
to
some
line
in
life
his
father
was
known
as
a
manager
of
estates
his
uncle
as
a
he
was
minded
to
follow
the
steps
of
his
grandfather
and
be
a
statesman
he
was
eaten
up
by
no
high
ambition
but
lived
in
the
hope
that
by
perseverance
he
might
live
to
become
a
useful
under
secretary
and
perhaps
ultimately
a
privy
seal
as
he
was
well
educated
and
laborious
and
had
no
objection
to
sitting
for
five
hours
together
in
the
house
of
commons
with
nothing
to
do
and
sometimes
with
very
little
to
hear
it
was
thought
by
his
friends
that
he
would
succeed
and
what
is
it
i
can
do
he
said
with
that
affable
smile
to
which
he
had
already
become
accustomed
as
a
government
politician
i
am
in
great
trouble
said
arabella
leaving
her
hand
for
a
moment
in
his
as
she
spoke
i
am
sorry
for
that
what
sort
of
trouble
he
knew
that
his
uncle
and
his
aunt
family
were
always
short
of
money
and
was
already
considering
to
what
extent
he
would
go
in
granting
her
petition
do
you
know
lord
rufford
lord
rufford
yes
i
know
him
but
very
slightly
my
father
knows
him
very
much
better
than
i
do
i
have
just
been
at
mistletoe
and
he
was
there
my
story
is
so
hard
to
tell
i
had
better
out
with
it
at
once
lord
rufford
has
asked
me
to
be
his
wife
the
deuce
he
has
it
a
very
fine
property
and
quite
unembarrassed
and
now
he
repudiates
his
engagement
upon
hearing
this
the
young
lord
face
became
very
long
he
also
had
heard
something
of
the
past
life
of
his
handsome
cousin
though
he
had
always
felt
kindly
to
her
it
was
not
once
only
dear
me
i
should
have
thought
your
father
would
be
the
proper
person
papa
has
written
but
you
know
what
papa
is
does
the
duke
know
of
it
or
my
mother
it
partly
went
on
at
mistletoe
i
would
tell
you
the
whole
story
if
i
knew
how
then
she
did
tell
him
her
story
during
the
telling
of
which
he
sat
profoundly
silent
she
had
gone
to
stay
with
lady
penwether
at
lord
rufford
house
and
then
he
had
first
told
her
of
his
love
then
they
had
agreed
to
meet
at
mistletoe
and
she
had
begged
her
aunt
to
receive
her
she
had
not
told
her
aunt
at
once
and
her
aunt
had
been
angry
with
her
because
they
had
walked
together
then
she
had
told
everything
to
the
duchess
and
had
begged
the
duchess
to
ask
the
duke
to
speak
to
lord
rufford
at
mistletoe
lord
rufford
had
twice
renewed
his
offer
and
she
had
then
accepted
him
but
the
duke
had
not
spoken
to
him
before
he
left
the
place
she
owned
that
she
thought
the
duchess
had
been
a
little
hard
to
her
of
course
she
did
not
mean
to
complain
but
the
duchess
had
been
angry
with
her
because
she
had
hunted
and
now
in
answer
to
the
note
from
herself
had
come
a
letter
from
lord
rufford
in
which
he
repudiated
the
engagement
i
only
got
it
yesterday
and
i
came
at
once
to
you
i
do
not
think
you
will
see
your
cousin
treated
in
that
way
without
raising
your
hand
you
will
remember
that
i
have
no
brother
but
what
can
i
do
asked
lord
mistletoe
she
had
taken
great
trouble
with
her
face
so
that
she
was
able
to
burst
out
into
tears
she
had
on
a
veil
which
partly
concealed
her
she
did
not
believe
in
the
effect
of
a
pocket
handkerchief
but
sat
with
her
face
half
averted
tell
him
what
you
think
about
it
she
said
such
engagements
arabella
he
said
should
always
be
authenticated
by
a
third
party
it
is
for
that
reason
that
a
girl
generally
refers
her
lover
to
her
father
before
she
allows
herself
to
be
considered
as
engaged
think
what
my
position
has
been
i
wanted
to
refer
him
to
my
uncle
and
asked
the
duchess
my
mother
must
have
had
some
reason
i
sure
she
must
there
a
woman
in
london
knows
how
such
things
should
be
done
better
than
my
mother
i
can
write
to
lord
rufford
and
ask
him
for
an
explanation
but
i
do
not
see
what
good
it
would
do
if
you
were
in
earnest
about
it
he
would
be
afraid
of
you
i
do
think
he
would
in
the
least
if
i
were
to
make
a
noise
about
it
it
would
only
do
you
harm
you
would
wish
all
the
world
to
know
that
he
had
jilted
me
i
do
care
what
the
world
knows
am
i
to
put
up
with
such
treatment
as
that
and
do
nothing
do
you
like
to
see
your
cousin
treated
in
that
way
i
do
like
it
at
all
lord
rufford
is
a
good
sort
of
man
in
his
way
and
has
a
large
property
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
that
it
had
come
off
all
right
but
in
these
days
one
ca
make
a
man
marry
there
used
to
be
the
alternative
of
going
out
and
being
shot
at
but
that
is
over
now
and
a
man
is
to
do
just
as
he
pleases
i
am
afraid
so
if
a
man
is
known
to
have
behaved
badly
to
a
girl
public
opinion
will
condemn
him
can
anything
be
worse
than
this
treatment
of
me
lord
mistletoe
could
not
tell
her
that
he
had
alluded
to
absolute
knowledge
and
that
at
present
he
had
no
more
than
her
version
of
the
story
or
that
the
world
would
require
more
than
that
before
the
general
condemnation
of
which
he
had
spoken
would
come
so
he
sat
in
silence
and
shook
his
head
and
you
think
that
i
should
put
up
with
it
quietly
i
think
that
your
father
should
see
the
man
arabella
shook
her
head
contemptuously
if
you
wish
it
i
will
write
to
my
mother
i
would
rather
trust
to
my
uncle
i
do
know
what
he
could
do
but
i
will
write
to
him
if
you
please
and
you
wo
see
lord
rufford
he
sat
silent
for
a
minute
or
two
during
which
she
pressed
him
over
and
over
again
to
have
an
interview
with
her
recreant
lover
bringing
up
all
the
arguments
that
she
knew
reminding
him
of
their
former
affection
for
each
other
telling
him
that
she
had
no
brother
of
her
own
and
that
her
own
father
was
worse
than
useless
in
such
a
matter
a
word
or
two
she
said
of
the
nature
of
the
prize
to
be
gained
and
many
words
as
to
her
absolute
right
to
regard
that
prize
as
her
own
but
at
last
he
refused
i
am
not
the
person
to
do
it
he
said
even
if
i
were
your
brother
i
should
not
be
so
unless
with
the
view
of
punishing
him
for
his
conduct
in
which
place
the
punishment
to
you
would
be
worse
than
any
i
could
inflict
on
him
it
can
not
be
good
that
any
young
lady
should
have
her
name
in
the
mouths
of
all
the
lovers
of
gossip
in
the
country
she
was
going
to
burst
out
at
him
in
her
anger
but
before
the
words
were
out
of
her
mouth
she
remembered
herself
she
could
not
afford
to
make
enemies
and
certainly
not
an
enemy
of
him
perhaps
then
she
said
you
had
better
tell
your
mother
all
that
i
have
told
you
i
will
write
to
the
duke
myself
and
so
she
left
him
and
as
she
returned
to
orchard
street
in
the
brougham
she
applied
to
him
every
term
of
reproach
she
could
bring
to
mind
he
was
selfish
and
a
coward
and
utterly
devoid
of
all
feeling
of
family
honour
he
was
a
prig
and
unmanly
and
false
a
real
cousin
would
have
burst
out
into
a
passion
and
have
declared
himself
ready
to
seize
lord
rufford
by
the
throat
and
shake
him
into
instant
matrimony
but
this
man
through
whose
veins
water
was
running
instead
of
blood
had
no
feeling
no
heart
no
capability
for
anger
oh
what
a
vile
world
it
was
a
little
help
so
very
little
would
have
made
everything
straight
for
her
if
her
aunt
had
only
behaved
at
mistletoe
as
aunts
should
behave
there
would
have
been
no
difficulty
in
her
misery
she
thought
that
the
world
was
more
cruel
to
her
than
to
any
other
person
in
it
on
her
arrival
at
home
she
was
astounded
by
a
letter
that
she
found
there
a
letter
of
such
a
nature
that
it
altogether
drove
out
of
her
head
the
purpose
which
she
had
of
writing
to
the
duke
on
that
evening
the
letter
was
from
john
morton
and
now
reached
her
through
the
lawyer
to
whom
it
had
been
sent
by
private
hand
for
immediate
delivery
it
ran
as
follows
dearest
arabella
i
am
very
ill
so
ill
that
fanning
who
has
come
down
from
london
has
i
think
but
a
poor
opinion
of
my
case
he
does
not
say
that
it
is
hopeless
and
that
is
all
i
think
it
right
to
tell
you
this
as
my
affection
for
you
is
what
it
always
has
been
if
you
wish
to
see
me
you
and
your
mother
had
better
come
to
bragton
at
once
you
can
telegraph
i
am
too
weak
to
write
more
yours
most
affectionately
john
morton
there
is
nothing
infectious
john
morton
is
dying
she
almost
screamed
out
to
her
mother
dying
so
he
says
oh
what
an
unfortunate
wretch
i
am
everything
that
touches
me
comes
to
grief
then
she
burst
out
into
a
flood
of
true
unfeigned
tears
it
wo
matter
so
much
said
lady
augustus
if
you
mean
to
write
to
the
duke
and
go
on
with
this
other
affair
oh
mamma
how
can
you
talk
in
that
way
well
my
dear
you
know
i
am
heartless
i
know
that
but
you
are
ten
times
worse
think
how
i
have
treated
him
i
do
want
him
to
die
my
dear
but
what
can
i
say
i
ca
do
him
any
good
it
is
all
in
god
hands
and
if
he
must
die
why
it
make
so
much
difference
to
you
i
have
looked
upon
all
that
as
over
for
a
long
time
it
is
not
over
after
all
he
has
liked
me
better
than
any
of
them
he
wants
me
to
go
to
bragton
that
of
course
is
out
of
the
question
it
is
not
out
of
the
question
at
all
i
shall
go
arabella
and
you
must
go
with
me
mamma
i
will
do
no
such
thing
said
lady
augustus
to
whom
the
idea
of
bragton
was
terrible
indeed
you
must
he
has
asked
me
to
go
and
i
shall
do
it
you
can
hardly
let
me
go
alone
and
what
will
you
say
to
lord
rufford
i
do
care
for
lord
rufford
is
he
to
prevent
my
going
where
i
please
and
your
father
and
the
duke
and
the
duchess
how
can
you
go
there
after
all
that
you
have
been
doing
since
you
left
what
do
i
care
for
the
duke
and
the
duchess
it
has
come
to
that
that
i
care
for
no
one
they
are
all
throwing
me
over
that
little
wretch
mistletoe
will
do
nothing
this
man
really
loved
me
he
has
never
treated
me
badly
whether
he
live
or
whether
he
die
he
has
been
true
to
me
then
she
sat
and
thought
of
it
all
what
would
lord
rufford
care
for
her
father
letter
if
her
cousin
mistletoe
would
not
stir
in
her
behalf
what
chance
had
she
with
her
uncle
and
though
she
had
thoroughly
despised
her
cousin
she
had
understood
and
had
unconsciously
believed
much
that
he
had
said
to
her
in
these
days
one
ca
make
a
man
marry
what
horrid
days
they
were
but
john
morton
would
marry
her
if
he
were
well
in
spite
of
all
her
ill
usage
of
course
he
would
die
and
so
she
would
again
be
overwhelmed
but
yet
she
would
go
and
see
him
as
she
determined
to
do
so
there
was
something
even
in
her
hard
callous
heart
softer
than
the
love
of
money
and
more
human
than
the
dream
of
an
advantageous
settlement
in
life
chapter
xxiv
the
senator
second
letter
in
the
mean
time
our
friend
the
senator
up
in
london
was
much
distracted
in
his
mind
finding
no
one
to
sympathise
with
him
in
his
efforts
conscious
of
his
own
rectitude
of
purpose
always
brave
against
others
and
yet
with
a
sad
doubt
in
his
own
mind
whether
it
could
be
possible
that
he
should
always
be
right
and
everybody
around
him
wrong
coming
away
from
mainwaring
dinner
he
had
almost
quarrelled
with
john
morton
or
rather
john
morton
had
altogether
quarrelled
with
him
on
their
way
back
from
dillsborough
to
bragton
the
minister
elect
to
patagonia
had
told
him
in
so
many
words
that
he
had
misbehaved
himself
at
the
clergyman
house
did
i
say
anything
that
was
untrue
asked
the
senator
was
i
inaccurate
in
my
statements
if
so
no
man
alive
will
be
more
ready
to
recall
what
he
has
said
and
to
ask
for
pardon
morton
endeavoured
to
explain
to
him
that
it
was
not
his
statements
which
were
at
fault
so
much
as
the
opinions
based
on
them
and
the
language
in
which
those
opinions
were
given
but
the
senator
could
not
be
made
to
understand
that
a
man
had
not
a
right
to
his
opinions
and
a
right
also
to
the
use
of
forcible
language
as
long
as
he
abstained
from
personalities
it
was
extremely
personal
all
that
you
said
about
the
purchase
of
livings
said
morton
how
was
i
to
know
that
rejoined
the
senator
when
in
private
society
i
inveigh
against
pickpockets
i
can
not
imagine
sir
that
there
should
be
a
pickpocket
in
the
company
as
the
senator
said
this
he
was
grieving
in
his
heart
at
the
trouble
he
had
occasioned
and
was
almost
repenting
the
duties
he
had
imposed
on
himself
but
yet
his
voice
was
bellicose
and
antagonistic
the
conversation
was
carried
on
till
morton
found
himself
constrained
to
say
that
though
he
entertained
great
personal
respect
for
his
guest
he
could
not
go
with
him
again
into
society
he
was
ill
at
the
time
though
neither
he
himself
knew
it
nor
the
senator
on
the
next
morning
gotobed
returned
to
london
without
seeing
his
host
and
before
the
day
was
over
nupper
was
at
morton
bedside
he
was
already
suffering
from
gastric
fever
the
senator
was
in
truth
unhappy
as
he
returned
to
town
the
intimacy
between
him
and
the
late
secretary
of
legation
at
his
capital
had
arisen
from
a
mutual
understanding
between
them
that
each
was
to
be
allowed
to
see
the
faults
and
to
admire
the
virtues
of
their
two
countries
and
that
conversation
between
them
was
to
be
based
on
the
mutual
system
but
nobody
can
in
truth
endure
to
be
told
of
shortcomings
either
on
his
own
part
or
on
that
of
his
country
he
himself
can
abuse
himself
or
his
country
but
he
can
not
endure
it
from
alien
lips
gotobed
had
hardly
said
a
word
about
england
which
morton
himself
might
not
have
said
but
such
words
coming
from
an
american
had
been
too
much
even
for
the
guarded
temper
of
an
unprejudiced
and
phlegmatic
englishman
the
senator
as
he
returned
alone
to
london
understood
something
of
this
and
when
a
few
days
later
he
heard
that
the
friend
who
had
quarrelled
with
him
was
ill
he
was
discontented
with
himself
and
sore
at
heart
but
he
had
his
task
to
perform
and
he
meant
to
perform
it
to
the
best
of
his
ability
in
his
own
country
he
had
heard
vehement
abuse
of
the
old
land
from
the
lips
of
politicians
and
had
found
at
the
same
time
almost
on
all
sides
great
social
admiration
for
the
people
so
abused
he
had
observed
that
every
englishman
of
distinction
was
received
in
the
states
as
a
demigod
and
that
some
who
were
not
very
great
in
their
own
land
had
been
converted
into
heroes
in
his
english
books
were
read
there
english
laws
were
obeyed
there
english
habits
were
cultivated
often
at
the
expense
of
american
comfort
and
yet
it
was
the
fashion
among
orators
to
speak
of
the
english
as
a
stupid
and
enslaved
people
he
was
a
thoughtful
man
and
all
this
had
perplexed
him
so
that
he
had
obtained
leave
from
his
state
and
from
congress
to
be
absent
during
a
part
of
a
short
session
and
had
come
over
determined
to
learn
as
much
as
he
could
everything
he
heard
and
almost
everything
he
saw
offended
him
at
some
point
and
yet
in
the
midst
of
it
all
he
was
conscious
that
he
was
surrounded
by
people
who
claimed
and
made
good
their
claims
to
superiority
what
was
a
lord
let
him
be
ever
so
rich
and
have
ever
so
many
titles
and
yet
even
with
such
a
popinjay
as
lord
rufford
he
himself
felt
the
lordship
when
that
old
farmer
at
the
hunt
breakfast
had
removed
himself
and
his
belongings
to
the
other
side
of
the
table
the
senator
though
aware
of
the
justice
of
his
cause
had
been
keenly
alive
to
the
rebuke
he
had
expressed
himself
very
boldly
at
the
rector
house
at
dillsborough
and
had
been
certain
that
not
a
word
of
real
argument
had
been
possible
in
answer
to
him
but
yet
he
left
the
house
with
a
feeling
almost
of
shame
which
had
grown
into
real
penitence
before
he
reached
bragton
he
knew
that
he
had
already
been
condemned
by
englishmen
as
and
absurd
he
was
as
much
alive
as
any
man
to
the
inward
distress
of
heart
which
such
a
conviction
brings
with
it
to
all
sensitive
minds
and
yet
he
had
his
purpose
and
would
follow
it
out
he
was
already
hard
at
work
on
the
lecture
which
he
meant
to
deliver
somewhere
in
london
before
he
went
back
to
his
home
duties
and
had
made
it
known
to
the
world
at
large
that
he
meant
to
say
some
sharp
things
of
the
country
he
was
visiting
soon
after
his
return
to
town
he
was
present
at
the
opening
of
parliament
mounser
green
of
the
foreign
office
having
seen
that
he
was
properly
accommodated
with
a
seat
then
he
went
down
to
the
election
of
a
member
of
parliament
in
the
little
borough
of
quinborough
it
was
unfortunate
for
great
britain
which
was
on
its
trial
and
unpleasant
also
for
the
poor
senator
who
had
appointed
himself
judge
that
such
a
seat
should
have
fallen
vacant
at
that
moment
quinborough
was
a
little
town
of
inhabitants
clustering
round
the
gates
of
a
great
whig
marquis
which
had
been
spared
who
can
say
why
at
the
first
reform
bill
and
having
but
one
member
had
come
out
scatheless
from
the
second
quinborough
still
returned
its
one
member
with
something
less
than
constituents
and
in
spite
of
household
suffrage
and
the
ballot
had
always
returned
the
member
favoured
by
the
marquis
this
nobleman
driven
no
doubt
by
his
conscience
to
make
some
return
to
the
country
for
the
favour
shown
to
his
family
had
always
sent
to
parliament
some
useful
and
distinguished
man
who
without
such
patronage
might
have
been
unable
to
serve
his
country
on
the
present
occasion
a
friend
of
the
people
so
called
an
unlettered
demagogue
such
as
is
in
england
in
truth
distasteful
to
all
classes
had
taken
himself
down
to
quinborough
as
a
candidate
in
opposition
to
the
nobleman
nominee
he
had
been
backed
by
all
the
sympathies
of
the
american
senator
who
knew
nothing
of
him
or
his
unfitness
and
nothing
whatever
of
the
patriotism
of
the
marquis
but
he
did
know
what
was
the
population
and
what
the
constituency
of
liverpool
and
also
what
were
those
of
quinborough
he
supposed
that
he
knew
what
was
the
theory
of
representation
in
england
and
he
understood
correctly
that
hitherto
the
member
for
quinborough
had
been
the
nominee
of
that
great
lord
these
things
were
horrid
to
him
there
was
to
his
thinking
a
fiction
more
than
fiction
a
falseness
about
all
this
which
not
only
would
but
ought
to
bring
the
country
prostrate
to
the
dust
when
the
candidate
whose
political
programme
consisted
of
a
general
disbelief
in
all
religions
received
by
ballot
only
nine
votes
from
those
voters
the
senator
declared
to
himself
that
the
country
must
be
rotten
to
the
core
it
was
not
only
that
britons
were
slaves
but
that
they
hugged
their
chains
to
the
gentleman
who
assured
him
that
the
right
honble
would
make
a
much
better
member
of
parliament
than
tom
bobster
the
plasterer
from
shoreditch
he
in
vain
tried
to
prove
that
the
respective
merits
of
the
two
men
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
it
had
been
the
duty
of
those
voters
to
show
to
the
world
that
in
the
exercise
of
a
privilege
entrusted
to
them
for
the
public
service
they
had
not
been
under
the
dictation
of
their
rich
neighbour
instead
of
doing
so
they
had
almost
unanimously
grovelled
in
the
dust
at
their
rich
feet
there
are
but
one
or
two
such
places
left
in
all
england
said
the
gentleman
but
those
one
or
two
answered
the
senator
were
wilfully
left
there
by
the
parliament
which
represented
the
whole
nation
then
quite
early
in
the
session
immediately
after
the
voting
of
the
address
a
motion
had
been
made
by
the
government
of
the
day
for
introducing
household
suffrage
into
the
counties
no
one
knew
the
labour
to
which
the
senator
subjected
himself
in
order
that
he
might
master
all
these
peculiarities
that
he
might
learn
how
men
became
members
of
parliament
and
how
they
ceased
to
be
so
in
what
degree
the
house
of
commons
was
made
up
of
different
elements
how
it
came
to
pass
that
though
there
was
a
house
of
lords
so
many
lords
sat
in
the
lower
chamber
all
those
matters
which
to
ordinary
educated
englishmen
are
almost
as
common
as
the
breath
of
their
nostrils
had
been
to
him
matter
of
long
and
serious
study
and
as
the
intent
student
who
has
zealously
buried
himself
for
a
week
among
commentaries
and
notes
feels
himself
qualified
to
question
porson
and
to
bentley
so
did
our
senator
believe
while
still
he
was
groping
among
the
rudiments
that
he
had
all
our
political
intricacies
at
his
fingers
ends
when
he
heard
the
arguments
used
for
a
difference
of
suffrage
in
the
towns
and
counties
and
found
that
even
they
who
were
proposing
the
change
were
not
ready
absolutely
to
assimilate
the
two
and
still
held
that
rural
ascendancy
feudalism
as
he
called
it
should
maintain
itself
by
barring
a
fraction
of
the
house
of
commons
from
the
votes
of
the
majority
he
pronounced
the
whole
thing
to
be
a
sham
the
intention
was
he
said
to
delude
the
people
it
is
all
coming
said
the
gentleman
who
was
accustomed
to
argue
with
him
in
those
days
he
spoke
in
a
sad
vein
which
was
in
itself
distressing
to
the
senator
why
should
you
be
in
such
a
hurry
the
senator
suggested
that
if
the
country
delayed
much
longer
this
imperative
task
of
putting
its
house
in
order
the
roof
would
have
fallen
in
before
the
repairs
were
done
then
he
found
that
this
gentleman
too
avoided
his
company
and
declined
to
sit
with
him
any
more
in
the
gallery
of
the
house
of
commons
added
to
all
this
was
a
private
rankling
sore
in
regard
to
goarly
and
bearside
he
had
now
learned
nearly
all
the
truth
about
goarly
and
had
learned
also
that
bearside
had
known
the
whole
when
he
had
last
visited
that
eminent
lawyer
office
goarly
had
deserted
his
supporters
and
had
turned
evidence
against
scrobby
his
partner
in
iniquity
that
goarly
was
a
rascal
the
senator
had
acknowledged
so
far
the
general
opinion
down
in
rufford
had
been
correct
but
he
could
get
nobody
to
see
or
at
any
rate
could
get
nobody
to
acknowledge
that
the
rascality
of
goarly
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
as
he
had
taken
it
up
the
man
right
to
his
own
land
his
right
to
be
protected
from
pheasants
and
foxes
from
horses
and
hounds
was
not
lessened
by
the
fact
that
he
was
a
poor
ignorant
squalid
dishonest
wretch
gotobed
had
now
received
a
bill
from
bearside
for
for
costs
in
the
case
leaving
after
the
deduction
of
already
paid
a
sum
of
stated
to
be
still
due
and
this
was
accompanied
by
an
intimation
that
as
he
gotobed
was
a
foreigner
soon
about
to
leave
the
country
bearside
must
request
that
his
claim
might
be
settled
quite
at
once
no
one
could
be
less
likely
than
our
senator
to
leave
a
foreign
country
without
paying
his
bills
he
had
quarrelled
with
morton
who
also
at
this
time
was
too
ill
to
have
given
him
much
assistance
though
he
had
become
acquainted
with
half
dillsborough
there
was
nobody
there
to
whom
he
could
apply
thus
he
was
driven
to
employ
a
london
attorney
and
the
london
attorney
told
him
that
he
had
better
pay
bearside
the
senator
remembering
at
the
time
that
he
would
also
have
to
pay
the
london
attorney
for
his
advice
he
gave
this
second
lawyer
authority
to
conclude
the
matter
and
at
last
bearside
accepted
when
the
london
attorney
refused
to
take
anything
for
his
trouble
the
senator
felt
such
conduct
almost
as
an
additional
grievance
in
his
existing
frame
of
mind
he
would
sooner
have
expended
a
few
more
dollars
than
be
driven
to
think
well
of
anything
connected
with
english
law
it
was
immediately
after
he
had
handed
over
the
money
in
liquidation
of
bearside
claim
that
he
sat
down
to
write
a
further
letter
to
his
friend
and
correspondent
josiah
scroome
his
letter
was
not
written
in
the
best
of
tempers
but
still
through
it
all
there
was
a
desire
to
be
just
and
an
anxiety
to
abstain
from
the
use
of
hard
phrases
the
letter
was
as
follows
fenton
hotel
james
street
london
my
dear
sir
since
i
last
wrote
i
have
had
much
to
trouble
me
and
little
perhaps
to
compensate
me
for
my
trouble
i
told
you
i
think
in
one
of
my
former
letters
that
wherever
i
went
i
found
myself
able
to
say
what
i
pleased
as
to
the
peculiarities
of
this
very
peculiar
people
i
am
not
now
going
to
contradict
what
i
said
then
wherever
i
go
i
do
speak
out
and
my
eyes
are
still
in
my
head
and
my
head
is
on
my
shoulders
but
i
have
to
acknowledge
to
myself
that
i
give
offence
morton
whom
you
knew
at
the
british
embassy
in
washington
and
who
i
fear
is
now
very
ill
parted
from
me
when
last
i
saw
him
in
anger
because
of
certain
opinions
i
had
expressed
in
a
clergyman
house
not
as
being
but
as
being
antagonistic
to
the
clergyman
himself
this
i
feel
to
be
unreasonable
and
in
the
neighbourhood
of
house
i
have
encountered
the
ill
will
of
a
great
many
not
for
having
spoken
untruth
for
that
i
have
never
heard
alleged
but
because
i
have
not
been
reticent
in
describing
the
things
which
i
have
seen
i
told
you
i
think
that
i
had
returned
to
neighbourhood
with
the
view
of
defending
an
oppressed
man
against
the
power
of
the
lord
who
was
oppressing
him
unfortunately
for
me
the
lord
though
a
scapegrace
spends
his
money
freely
and
is
a
hospitable
honest
fellow
whereas
the
injured
victim
has
turned
out
to
be
a
wretched
scoundrel
scoundrel
though
he
is
he
has
still
been
ill
used
and
the
lord
though
has
been
a
tyrant
but
the
poor
wretch
has
thrown
me
over
and
sold
himself
to
the
other
side
and
i
have
been
held
up
to
ignominy
by
all
the
provincial
newspapers
i
have
also
had
to
pay
through
the
nose
for
my
quixotism
a
sum
which
i
can
not
very
well
afford
this
money
i
have
lost
solely
with
the
view
of
defending
the
weak
but
nobody
with
whom
i
have
discussed
the
matter
seems
to
recognise
the
purity
of
my
object
i
am
only
reminded
that
i
have
put
myself
into
the
same
boat
with
a
rascal
i
feel
from
day
to
day
how
thoroughly
i
could
have
enjoyed
a
sojourn
in
this
country
if
i
had
come
here
without
any
line
of
duty
laid
down
for
myself
could
i
have
swum
with
the
stream
and
have
said
yes
or
no
as
yes
or
no
were
expected
i
might
have
revelled
in
generous
hospitality
nothing
can
be
pleasanter
than
the
houses
here
if
you
will
only
be
as
idle
as
the
owners
of
them
but
when
once
you
show
them
that
you
have
an
object
they
become
afraid
of
you
and
industry
in
such
houses
as
i
now
speak
of
is
a
crime
you
are
there
to
glide
through
the
day
luxuriously
in
the
house
or
to
rush
through
it
impetuously
on
horseback
or
with
a
gun
if
you
be
a
sportsman
sometimes
when
i
have
asked
questions
about
the
most
material
institutions
of
the
country
i
have
felt
that
i
was
looked
upon
with
absolute
loathing
this
is
disagreeable
and
yet
i
find
it
more
easy
in
this
country
to
sympathise
with
the
rich
than
with
the
poor
i
do
not
here
describe
my
own
actual
sympathies
but
only
the
easiness
with
which
they
might
be
evoked
the
rich
are
at
any
rate
pleasant
the
poor
are
very
much
the
reverse
there
is
no
backbone
of
mutiny
in
them
against
the
oppression
to
which
they
are
subjected
but
only
the
whining
of
a
dog
that
knows
itself
to
be
a
slave
and
pleads
with
his
soft
paw
for
tenderness
from
his
master
or
the
futile
growlings
of
the
caged
tiger
who
paces
up
and
down
before
his
bars
and
has
long
ago
forgotten
to
attempt
to
break
them
they
are
a
race
who
only
now
and
then
feel
themselves
stirred
up
to
contest
a
point
against
their
masters
on
the
basis
of
starvation
we
wo
work
but
on
such
and
such
terms
and
if
we
can
not
get
them
we
will
lie
down
and
die
that
i
take
it
is
the
real
argument
of
a
strike
but
they
never
do
lie
down
and
die
if
one
in
every
parish
one
in
every
county
would
do
so
then
the
agricultural
labourers
of
the
country
might
live
almost
as
well
as
the
farmers
pigs
i
was
present
the
other
day
at
the
opening
of
parliament
it
was
a
very
grand
ceremony
though
the
queen
did
not
find
herself
well
enough
to
do
her
duty
in
person
but
the
grandeur
was
everything
a
royal
programme
was
read
from
the
foot
of
the
throne
of
which
even
i
knew
all
the
details
beforehand
having
read
them
in
the
newspapers
two
opening
speeches
were
then
made
by
two
young
lords
not
after
all
so
very
young
which
sounded
like
lessons
recited
by
schoolboys
there
was
no
touch
of
eloquence
no
approach
to
it
it
was
clear
that
either
of
them
would
have
been
afraid
to
attempt
the
idiosyncrasy
of
passionate
expression
but
they
were
exquisitely
dressed
and
had
learned
their
lessons
to
a
marvel
the
flutter
of
the
ladies
dresses
and
the
presence
of
the
peers
and
the
historic
ornamentation
of
the
house
were
all
very
pleasant
but
they
reminded
me
of
a
last
year
nut
of
which
the
outside
appearance
has
been
mellowed
and
improved
by
time
but
the
fruit
inside
has
withered
away
and
become
tasteless
since
that
i
have
been
much
interested
with
an
attempt
a
further
morsel
of
cobbling
which
is
being
done
to
improve
the
representation
of
the
people
though
it
be
but
cobbling
if
it
be
in
the
right
direction
one
is
glad
of
it
i
do
not
know
how
far
you
may
have
studied
the
theories
and
system
of
the
british
house
of
commons
but
for
myself
i
must
own
that
it
was
not
till
the
other
day
that
i
was
aware
that
though
it
acts
together
as
one
whole
it
is
formed
of
two
distinct
parts
the
one
part
is
sent
thither
from
the
towns
by
household
suffrage
and
this
which
may
be
said
to
be
the
healthier
of
the
two
as
coming
more
directly
from
the
people
is
nevertheless
disfigured
by
a
multitude
of
anomalies
population
hardly
bears
upon
the
question
a
town
with
inhabitants
has
two
members
whereas
another
with
has
only
three
and
another
with
has
one
but
there
is
worse
disorder
than
this
in
the
happy
little
village
of
portarlington
constituents
choose
a
member
among
them
or
have
one
chosen
for
them
by
their
careful
lord
whereas
in
the
great
city
of
london
something
like
registered
electors
only
send
four
to
parliament
with
this
the
country
is
presumed
to
be
satisfied
but
in
the
counties
which
by
a
different
system
send
up
the
other
part
of
the
house
there
exists
still
a
heavy
property
qualification
for
voting
there
is
apparent
to
all
a
necessity
for
change
here
but
the
change
proposed
is
simply
a
reduction
of
the
qualification
so
that
the
rural
labourer
whose
class
is
probably
the
largest
as
it
is
the
poorest
in
the
country
is
still
disfranchised
and
will
remain
so
unless
it
be
his
chance
to
live
within
the
arbitrary
line
of
some
borough
for
these
boroughs
you
must
know
are
sometimes
strictly
confined
to
the
aggregations
of
houses
which
constitute
the
town
but
sometimes
stretch
out
their
arms
so
as
to
include
rural
districts
the
divisions
i
am
assured
were
made
to
suit
the
aspirations
of
political
magnates
when
the
first
reform
bill
was
passed
what
is
to
be
expected
of
a
country
in
which
such
absurdities
are
loved
and
sheltered
i
am
still
determined
to
express
my
views
on
these
matters
before
i
leave
england
and
am
with
great
labour
preparing
a
lecture
on
the
subject
i
am
assured
that
i
shall
not
be
debarred
from
my
utterances
because
that
which
i
say
is
unpopular
i
am
told
that
as
long
as
i
do
not
touch
her
majesty
or
her
majesty
family
or
the
christian
religion
which
is
only
the
second
holy
of
holies
i
may
say
anything
good
taste
would
save
me
from
the
former
offence
and
my
own
convictions
from
the
latter
but
my
friend
who
so
informs
me
doubts
whether
many
will
come
to
hear
me
he
tells
me
that
the
serious
american
is
not
popular
here
whereas
the
joker
is
much
run
after
of
that
i
must
take
my
chance
in
all
this
i
am
endeavouring
to
do
a
duty
feeling
every
day
more
strongly
my
own
inadequacy
were
i
to
follow
my
own
wishes
i
should
return
by
the
next
steamer

providence
interferes
the
battle
was
carried
on
very
fiercely
in
masters
house
in
dillsborough
to
the
misery
of
all
within
it
but
the
conviction
gained
ground
with
every
one
there
that
mary
was
to
be
sent
to
cheltenham
for
some
indefinite
time
dolly
and
kate
seemed
to
think
that
she
was
to
go
never
to
return
six
months
which
had
been
vaguely
mentioned
as
the
proposed
period
of
her
sojourn
was
to
them
almost
as
indefinite
as
eternity
the
two
girls
had
been
intensely
anxious
for
the
marriage
wishing
to
have
larry
for
a
brother
looking
forward
with
delight
to
their
share
in
the
unrestricted
plenteousness
of
chowton
farm
longing
to
be
allowed
to
consider
themselves
at
home
among
the
ricks
and
barns
and
wide
fields
but
at
this
moment
things
had
become
so
tragic
that
they
were
cowed
and
unhappy
not
that
mary
should
still
refuse
larry
twentyman
but
that
she
should
be
going
away
for
so
long
a
time
they
could
quarrel
with
their
elder
sister
while
the
assurance
was
still
with
them
that
she
would
be
there
to
forgive
them
but
now
that
she
was
going
away
and
that
it
had
come
to
be
believed
by
both
of
them
that
poor
lawrence
had
no
chance
they
were
sad
and
downhearted
in
all
that
misery
the
poor
attorney
had
the
worst
of
it
mary
was
free
from
her
stepmother
zeal
and
her
stepmother
persecution
at
any
rate
at
night
but
the
poor
father
was
hardly
allowed
to
sleep
for
masters
never
gave
up
her
game
as
altogether
lost
though
she
might
be
driven
alternately
into
towering
passion
and
prostrate
hysterics
she
would
still
come
again
to
the
battle
a
word
of
encouragement
would
she
said
bring
larry
twentyman
back
to
his
courtship
and
that
word
might
be
spoken
if
mary
visit
to
cheltenham
were
forbidden
what
did
the
letter
signify
or
all
the
protestations
did
not
everybody
know
how
young
women
were
but
how
they
could
be
brought
round
by
proper
usage
let
mary
once
be
made
to
understand
that
she
would
not
be
allowed
to
be
a
fine
lady
and
then
she
would
marry
twentyman
quick
enough
but
this
ushanting
this
journeying
to
cheltenham
in
order
that
nothing
might
be
done
was
the
very
way
to
promote
the
disease
this
masters
said
in
season
and
out
of
season
night
and
day
till
the
poor
husband
longed
for
his
daughter
departure
in
order
that
that
point
might
at
any
rate
be
settled
in
all
these
disputes
he
never
quite
yielded
though
his
heart
sank
within
him
he
was
still
firm
he
would
turn
his
back
to
his
wife
and
let
her
run
on
with
her
arguments
without
a
word
of
answer
till
at
last
he
would
bounce
out
of
bed
and
swear
that
if
she
did
not
leave
him
alone
he
would
go
and
lock
himself
into
the
office
and
sleep
with
his
head
on
the
office
desk
masters
was
almost
driven
to
despair
but
at
last
there
came
to
her
a
gleam
of
hope
most
unexpectedly
it
had
been
settled
that
mary
should
make
her
journey
on
friday
the
february
and
that
reginald
morton
was
again
to
accompany
her
this
in
itself
was
to
masters
an
aggravation
of
the
evil
which
was
being
done
she
was
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
reginald
morton
but
this
attendance
on
mary
was
in
the
eyes
of
her
stepmother
a
cockering
of
her
up
a
making
a
fine
lady
of
her
which
was
in
itself
of
all
things
the
most
pernicious
if
mary
must
go
to
cheltenham
why
could
she
not
go
by
herself
second
class
like
any
other
young
woman
nobody
would
eat
her
masters
declared
but
reginald
was
firm
in
his
purpose
of
accompanying
her
he
had
no
objection
whatever
to
the
second
class
if
masters
preferred
it
but
as
he
meant
to
make
the
journey
on
the
same
day
of
course
they
would
go
together
masters
said
that
he
was
very
much
obliged
masters
protested
that
it
was
all
trash
from
beginning
to
the
end
then
there
came
a
sudden
disruption
to
all
these
plans
and
a
sudden
renewal
of
her
hopes
to
masters
which
for
one
half
day
nearly
restored
her
to
good
humour
lady
ushant
wrote
to
postpone
the
visit
because
she
herself
had
been
summoned
to
bragton
her
letter
to
mary
though
affectionate
was
very
short
her
john
the
head
of
the
family
had
expressed
a
desire
to
see
her
and
with
that
wish
she
was
bound
to
comply
of
course
she
said
she
would
see
mary
at
bragton
or
if
that
were
not
possible
she
herself
would
come
into
dillsborough
she
did
not
know
what
might
be
the
length
of
her
visit
but
when
it
was
over
she
hoped
that
mary
would
return
with
her
to
cheltenham
the
old
lady
letter
to
reginald
was
much
longer
because
in
that
she
had
to
speak
of
the
state
of
john
health
and
of
her
surprise
that
she
should
be
summoned
to
his
bedside
of
course
she
would
go
though
she
could
not
look
forward
with
satisfaction
to
a
meeting
with
the
honble
morton
then
she
could
not
refrain
from
alluding
to
the
fact
that
if
anything
were
to
happen
to
john
morton
reginald
himself
would
be
the
squire
of
bragton
reginald
when
he
received
this
at
once
went
over
to
the
attorney
house
but
he
did
not
succeed
in
seeing
mary
he
learned
however
that
they
were
all
aware
that
the
journey
had
been
postponed
to
masters
it
seemed
that
all
this
had
been
a
dispensation
of
providence
lady
ushant
letter
had
been
received
on
the
thursday
and
masters
at
once
found
it
expedient
to
communicate
with
larry
twentyman
she
was
not
excellent
herself
at
the
writing
of
letters
and
therefore
she
got
dolly
to
be
the
scribe
before
the
thursday
evening
the
following
note
was
sent
to
chowton
farm
dear
larry
pray
come
and
go
to
the
club
with
father
on
saturday
we
have
seen
you
for
so
long
mother
has
got
something
to
tell
you
your
affectionate
friend
dolly
when
this
was
received
the
poor
man
was
smoking
his
moody
pipe
in
silence
as
he
roamed
about
his
own
farmyard
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
he
had
not
as
yet
known
any
comfort
and
was
still
firm
in
his
purpose
of
selling
the
farm
he
had
been
out
hunting
once
or
twice
but
fancied
that
people
looked
at
him
with
peculiar
eyes
he
could
not
ride
though
he
made
one
or
two
forlorn
attempts
to
break
his
neck
he
did
not
care
in
the
least
whether
they
found
or
not
and
when
captain
glomax
was
held
to
have
disgraced
himself
thoroughly
by
wasting
an
hour
in
digging
out
and
then
killing
a
vixen
he
had
not
a
word
to
say
about
it
but
as
he
read
dolly
note
there
came
back
something
of
life
into
his
eyes
he
had
forsworn
the
club
but
would
certainly
go
when
thus
invited
he
wrote
a
scrawl
to
dolly
come
and
having
sent
it
off
by
the
messenger
tried
to
trust
that
there
might
yet
be
ground
for
hope
masters
would
not
have
allowed
dolly
to
send
such
a
message
without
good
reason
on
the
friday
masters
could
not
abstain
from
proposing
that
mary
visit
to
cheltenham
should
be
regarded
as
altogether
out
of
the
question
she
had
no
new
argument
to
offer
except
this
last
interposition
of
providence
in
her
favour
masters
said
that
he
did
not
see
why
mary
should
not
return
with
lady
ushant
various
things
however
might
happen
john
morton
might
die
and
then
who
could
tell
whether
lady
ushant
would
ever
return
to
cheltenham
in
this
way
the
peace
soon
came
to
an
end
especially
as
masters
endeavoured
to
utilize
for
general
family
purposes
certain
articles
which
had
been
purchased
with
a
view
to
prolonged
residence
away
from
home
this
was
resented
by
the
attorney
and
the
peace
was
on
the
saturday
larry
came
to
the
astonishment
of
masters
who
was
still
in
his
office
at
seven
masters
at
once
got
hold
of
him
and
conveyed
him
away
into
the
sacred
mary
is
not
going
she
said
not
going
to
cheltenham
it
has
all
been
put
off
she
sha
go
at
all
if
i
can
help
it
but
why
has
it
been
put
off
mrs
masters
lady
ushant
is
coming
to
bragton
i
suppose
that
poor
man
is
dying
he
is
very
ill
certainly
and
if
anything
happens
there
who
can
say
what
may
happen
anywhere
else
lady
ushant
will
have
something
else
except
mary
to
think
of
if
her
own
nephew
comes
into
all
the
property
i
did
know
she
was
such
friends
with
the
squire
as
that
well
there
it
is
lady
ushant
is
coming
to
bragton
and
mary
is
not
going
to
cheltenham
this
she
said
as
though
the
news
must
be
of
vital
importance
to
larry
twentyman
he
stood
for
awhile
scratching
his
head
as
he
thought
of
it
at
last
it
appeared
to
him
that
mary
continual
residence
in
dillsborough
would
of
itself
hardly
assist
him
i
do
see
masters
that
that
will
make
her
a
bit
kinder
to
me
larry
do
you
be
a
coward
nor
yet
soft
as
for
coward
masters
i
do
know
i
suppose
you
really
do
love
the
girl
i
do
i
think
i
shown
that
and
you
have
changed
your
mind
not
a
bit
that
why
i
speak
open
to
you
do
you
be
afraid
of
her
the
letter
which
a
girl
like
that
writes
when
she
gets
tantrums
into
her
head
of
course
she
write
a
letter
but
there
somebody
else
mrs
masters
who
says
so
i
say
there
ai
nobody
nobody
if
anybody
tells
you
that
it
only
just
to
put
you
off
it
just
poetry
and
books
and
rubbish
she
wants
to
be
a
fine
lady
i
make
her
a
lady
you
make
her
twentyman
and
do
you
be
made
by
any
one
to
give
it
up
go
to
the
club
with
masters
now
and
come
here
just
the
same
as
usual
come
and
have
a
gossip
with
the
girls
together
and
show
that
you
can
keep
your
pluck
up
that
the
way
to
win
her
larry
did
go
to
the
club
and
did
think
very
much
of
it
as
he
walked
home
he
had
promised
to
come
on
the
sunday
afternoon
but
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
believe
in
that
theory
of
books
and
poetry
put
forward
by
masters
books
and
poetry
would
not
teach
a
girl
like
mary
to
reject
her
suitor
if
she
really
loved
him
chapter
xxvi
lady
ushant
at
bragton
on
the
sunday
larry
came
into
dillsborough
and
had
his
gossip
with
the
girls
according
to
order
but
it
was
not
very
successful
masters
who
opened
the
door
for
him
instructed
him
in
a
special
whisper
to
talk
away
just
as
though
he
did
not
care
a
fig
for
mary
he
made
the
attempt
manfully
but
with
slight
effect
his
love
was
too
genuine
too
absorbing
to
leave
with
him
the
power
which
masters
assumed
him
to
have
when
she
gave
him
such
advice
a
man
can
not
walk
when
he
has
broken
his
let
him
be
ever
so
brave
in
the
attempt
larry
heart
was
so
weighed
that
he
could
not
hide
the
weight
dolly
and
kate
had
also
received
hints
and
struggled
hard
to
be
merry
in
the
afternoon
a
walk
was
suggested
and
mary
complied
but
when
an
attempt
was
made
by
the
younger
girls
to
leave
the
lover
and
mary
together
she
resented
it
by
clinging
closely
to
dolly
and
then
all
larry
courage
deserted
him
very
little
good
was
done
on
the
occasion
by
masters
manoeuvres
on
the
monday
morning
in
compliance
with
a
request
made
by
lady
ushant
mary
walked
over
to
bragton
to
see
her
old
friend
masters
had
declared
the
request
to
be
very
unreasonable
who
is
to
walk
five
miles
and
back
to
see
an
old
woman
like
that
to
this
mary
had
replied
that
the
distance
across
the
fields
to
bragton
was
only
four
miles
and
that
she
had
often
walked
it
with
her
sisters
for
the
very
pleasure
of
the
walk
not
in
weather
like
this
said
masters
but
the
day
was
well
enough
roads
in
february
are
often
a
little
wet
but
there
was
no
rain
falling
i
say
it
unreasonable
said
masters
if
she
ca
send
a
carriage
she
ought
to
expect
it
this
coming
from
masters
whose
great
doctrine
it
was
that
young
women
ought
not
to
be
afraid
of
work
was
so
clearly
the
effect
of
sheer
opposition
that
mary
disdained
to
answer
it
then
she
was
accused
of
treating
her
stepmother
with
contempt
she
did
walk
to
bragton
taking
the
path
by
the
fields
and
over
the
bridge
and
loitering
for
a
few
minutes
as
she
leant
upon
the
rail
it
was
there
and
there
only
that
she
had
seen
together
the
two
men
who
between
them
seemed
to
cloud
all
her
life
the
man
whom
she
loved
and
the
man
who
loved
her
she
knew
now
she
thought
that
she
knew
quite
well
that
her
feelings
for
reginald
morton
were
of
such
a
nature
that
she
could
not
possibly
become
the
wife
of
any
one
else
but
had
she
not
seen
him
for
those
few
minutes
on
this
spot
had
he
not
fired
her
imagination
by
telling
her
of
his
desire
to
go
back
with
her
over
the
sites
which
they
had
seen
together
when
she
was
a
child
she
would
not
she
thought
have
been
driven
to
make
to
herself
so
grievous
a
confession
in
that
case
it
might
have
been
that
she
would
have
brought
herself
to
give
her
hand
to
the
suitor
of
whom
all
her
friends
approved
and
then
with
infinite
tenderness
she
thought
of
all
virtues
and
especially
of
that
great
virtue
in
a
woman
eyes
the
constancy
of
his
devotion
to
herself
she
did
love
him
but
with
a
varied
love
a
love
which
was
most
earnest
in
wishing
his
happiness
which
would
have
been
desirous
of
the
closest
friendship
if
only
nothing
more
were
required
she
swore
to
herself
a
thousand
times
that
she
did
not
look
down
upon
him
because
he
was
only
a
farmer
that
she
did
not
think
herself
in
any
way
superior
to
him
but
it
was
impossible
that
she
should
consent
to
be
his
wife
and
then
she
thought
of
the
other
man
with
feelings
much
less
kind
why
had
he
thrust
himself
upon
her
life
and
disturbed
her
why
had
he
taught
her
to
think
herself
unfit
to
mate
with
this
lover
who
was
her
equal
why
had
he
assured
her
that
were
she
to
do
so
her
old
friends
would
be
revolted
why
had
he
exacted
from
her
a
promise
a
promise
which
was
sacred
to
her
that
she
would
not
so
give
herself
away
yes
the
promise
was
certainly
sacred
but
he
had
been
cold
and
cruel
in
forcing
it
from
her
lips
what
business
was
it
of
his
why
should
he
have
meddled
with
her
in
the
shallow
streamlet
of
her
lowly
life
the
waters
might
have
glided
on
slow
but
smoothly
had
he
not
taught
them
to
be
ambitious
of
a
rapider
grander
course
now
they
were
disturbed
by
mud
and
there
could
be
no
pleasure
in
them
she
went
on
over
the
bridge
and
round
by
the
shrubbery
to
the
hall
door
which
was
opened
to
her
by
hopkins
yes
lady
ushant
was
there
but
the
young
squire
was
very
ill
and
his
aunt
was
then
with
him
reginald
was
in
the
library
would
miss
masters
be
shown
in
there
or
would
she
go
up
to
lady
ushant
own
room
of
course
she
replied
that
she
would
go
and
there
wait
for
lady
ushant
when
she
was
found
by
her
friend
she
was
told
at
length
the
story
of
all
the
circumstances
which
had
brought
lady
ushant
to
bragton
when
john
morton
had
first
been
taken
ill
before
any
fixed
idea
of
danger
had
occurred
to
himself
or
to
others
his
grandmother
had
come
to
him
then
as
he
gradually
became
weaker
he
made
various
propositions
which
were
all
of
them
terribly
distasteful
to
the
old
woman
in
the
first
place
he
had
insisted
on
sending
for
miss
trefoil
up
to
this
period
mary
masters
had
hardly
heard
the
name
of
miss
trefoil
and
almost
shuddered
as
she
was
at
once
immersed
in
all
these
family
secrets
she
is
to
be
here
said
lady
ushant
oh
dear
how
sad
he
insists
upon
it
and
she
is
coming
she
was
here
before
and
it
now
turns
out
that
all
the
world
knew
that
they
were
engaged
that
was
no
secret
for
everybody
had
heard
it
and
where
is
morton
now
then
lady
ushant
went
on
with
her
story
the
sick
man
had
insisted
on
making
his
will
and
had
declared
his
purpose
of
leaving
the
property
to
his
cousin
reginald
as
lady
ushant
said
there
was
no
one
else
to
whom
he
could
leave
it
with
any
propriety
but
this
had
become
matter
for
bitter
contention
between
the
old
woman
and
her
grandson
who
did
she
think
should
have
it
asked
mary
ah
that
i
do
know
that
he
has
never
told
me
but
she
has
had
the
wickedness
to
say
oh
such
things
of
reginald
i
knew
all
that
before
but
that
she
should
repeat
them
now
is
terrible
i
suppose
she
wanted
it
for
some
of
her
own
people
but
it
was
so
horrible
you
know
when
he
was
so
ill
then
he
said
that
he
should
send
for
me
so
that
what
is
left
of
the
family
might
be
together
after
that
she
went
away
in
anger
hopkins
says
that
she
did
not
even
see
him
the
morning
she
left
bragton
she
was
always
said
mary
and
dictatorial
beyond
measure
she
nearly
broke
my
poor
dear
father
heart
and
then
she
left
the
house
because
he
would
not
shut
his
doors
against
reginald
mother
and
now
i
hardly
know
what
i
am
to
do
here
or
what
i
must
say
to
this
young
lady
when
she
comes
is
she
coming
alone
we
do
know
she
has
a
mother
lady
augustus
trefoil
but
whether
lady
augustus
will
accompany
her
daughter
we
have
not
heard
reginald
says
certainly
not
or
they
would
have
told
us
so
you
have
seen
reginald
no
lady
ushant
you
must
see
him
he
is
here
now
think
what
a
difference
it
will
make
to
him
but
lady
ushant
is
he
so
bad
fanning
almost
says
that
there
is
no
hope
this
poor
young
woman
that
is
coming
what
am
i
to
say
to
her
he
has
made
his
will
that
was
done
before
i
came
i
do
know
why
he
should
have
sent
for
your
father
but
he
had
a
gentleman
down
from
town
i
suppose
he
will
leave
her
something
but
it
is
a
great
thing
that
bragton
should
remain
in
the
family
oh
dear
oh
dear
if
any
one
but
a
morton
were
to
be
here
it
would
break
my
heart
reginald
is
the
only
one
left
now
of
the
old
branch
he
getting
old
and
he
ought
to
marry
it
is
so
serious
when
there
an
old
family
property
i
suppose
he
will
only
yes
exactly
one
ca
even
think
about
it
while
this
poor
young
man
is
lying
so
morton
has
been
almost
like
his
mother
and
has
lived
upon
the
bragton
property
absolutely
lived
upon
it
and
now
she
is
away
from
him
because
he
chooses
to
do
what
he
likes
with
his
own
is
it
not
awful
and
she
would
not
put
her
foot
in
the
house
if
she
knew
that
reginald
was
here
she
told
hopkins
as
much
and
she
said
that
she
would
so
much
as
write
a
line
to
me
poor
fellow
he
wrote
it
himself
and
now
he
thinks
so
much
about
it
when
fanning
went
back
to
london
yesterday
i
think
he
took
some
message
to
her
mary
remained
there
till
lunch
was
announced
but
refused
to
go
down
into
the
parlour
urging
that
she
was
expected
home
for
dinner
and
there
is
no
chance
for
mr
twentyman
asked
lady
ushant
mary
shook
her
head
poor
man
i
do
feel
sorry
for
him
as
everybody
speaks
so
well
of
him
of
course
my
dear
i
have
nothing
to
say
about
it
i
do
think
girls
should
ever
be
in
a
hurry
to
marry
and
if
you
ca
love
him
dear
lady
ushant
it
is
quite
settled
poor
young
man
but
you
must
go
and
see
reginald
then
she
was
taken
into
the
library
and
did
see
reginald
were
she
to
avoid
him
specially
she
would
tell
her
tale
almost
as
plainly
as
though
she
were
to
run
after
him
he
greeted
her
kindly
almost
affectionately
expressing
his
extreme
regret
that
his
visit
to
cheltenham
should
have
been
postponed
and
a
hope
that
she
would
be
much
at
bragton
the
distance
is
so
great
reginald
said
lady
ushant
i
can
drive
her
over
it
is
a
long
walk
and
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
get
runciman
little
phaeton
i
shall
order
it
for
if
miss
masters
will
come
but
miss
masters
would
not
agree
to
this
she
would
walk
over
again
some
day
as
she
liked
the
walk
but
no
doubt
she
would
only
be
in
the
way
if
she
were
to
come
often
i
have
told
her
about
miss
trefoil
said
lady
ushant
you
know
my
dear
i
look
upon
you
almost
as
one
of
ourselves
because
you
lived
here
so
long
but
perhaps
you
had
better
postpone
coming
again
till
she
has
gone
certainly
lady
ushant
it
might
be
difficult
to
explain
i
do
suppose
she
will
stay
long
perhaps
she
will
go
back
the
same
day
i
am
sure
i
sha
know
what
to
say
to
her
but
when
anything
is
fixed
i
will
send
you
in
word
by
the
postman
reginald
would
have
walked
back
with
her
across
the
bridge
but
that
he
had
promised
to
go
to
his
cousin
immediately
after
lunch
as
it
was
he
offered
to
accompany
her
a
part
of
the
way
but
was
stopped
by
his
aunt
greatly
to
mary
comfort
he
was
now
more
beyond
her
reach
than
ever
more
utterly
removed
from
her
he
would
probably
become
squire
of
bragton
and
she
in
her
earliest
days
had
heard
the
late
squire
spoken
of
as
though
he
were
one
of
the
potentates
of
the
earth
she
had
never
thought
it
possible
but
now
it
was
less
possible
than
ever
there
was
something
in
his
manner
to
her
almost
protective
almost
fatherly
as
though
he
had
some
authority
over
her
lady
ushant
had
authority
once
but
he
had
none
in
every
tone
of
his
voice
she
felt
that
she
heard
an
expression
of
interest
in
her
welfare
but
it
was
the
interest
which
a
person
takes
in
a
child
or
a
superior
in
an
inferior
of
course
he
was
her
superior
but
yet
the
tone
of
his
voice
was
distasteful
to
her
as
she
walked
back
to
dillsborough
she
told
herself
that
she
would
not
go
again
to
bragton
without
assuring
herself
that
he
was
not
there
when
she
reached
home
many
questions
were
asked
of
her
but
she
told
nothing
of
the
secrets
of
the
morton
family
which
had
been
so
openly
confided
to
her
she
would
only
say
that
she
was
afraid
that
john
morton
was
very
chapter
xxvii
arabella
again
at
bragton
arabella
trefoil
had
adhered
without
flinching
to
the
purpose
she
had
expressed
of
going
down
to
bragton
to
see
the
sick
man
and
yet
at
that
very
time
she
was
in
the
midst
of
her
contest
with
lord
rufford
she
was
aware
that
a
correspondence
was
going
on
between
her
father
and
the
young
lord
and
that
her
father
had
demanded
an
interview
she
was
aware
also
that
the
matter
had
been
discussed
at
the
family
mansion
in
piccadilly
the
duke
having
come
up
to
london
for
the
purpose
and
that
the
duke
and
his
brother
who
hardly
ever
spoke
to
each
other
had
absolutely
had
a
conference
and
this
conference
had
had
results
the
duke
had
not
himself
consented
to
interfere
but
he
had
agreed
to
a
compromise
proposed
by
his
son
lord
augustus
should
be
authorised
to
ask
lord
rufford
to
meet
him
in
the
library
of
the
piccadilly
mansion
so
that
there
should
be
some
savour
of
the
dukedom
in
what
might
be
done
and
said
there
lord
rufford
would
by
the
surroundings
be
made
to
feel
that
in
rejecting
arabella
he
was
rejecting
the
duke
and
all
the
mayfair
belongings
and
that
in
accepting
her
he
would
be
entitled
to
regard
himself
as
accepting
them
all
but
by
allowing
thus
much
the
duke
would
not
compromise
himself
nor
the
duchess
nor
lord
mistletoe
lord
mistletoe
with
that
prudence
which
will
certainly
in
future
years
make
him
a
useful
assistant
to
some
minister
of
the
day
had
seen
all
this
and
so
it
had
been
arranged
but
in
spite
of
these
doings
arabella
had
insisted
on
complying
with
john
morton
wish
that
she
go
down
and
visit
him
in
his
bed
at
bragton
her
mother
who
in
these
days
was
driven
almost
to
desperation
by
her
daughter
conduct
tried
her
best
to
prevent
the
useless
journey
but
tried
in
vain
then
she
said
in
wrath
to
arabella
i
will
tell
your
father
and
i
will
tell
the
duke
and
i
will
tell
lord
rufford
that
they
need
not
trouble
themselves
any
further
you
know
mamma
that
you
will
do
nothing
of
the
kind
said
arabella
and
the
poor
woman
did
do
nothing
of
the
kind
what
is
it
to
them
whether
i
see
the
man
or
not
the
girl
said
they
are
not
such
fools
as
to
suppose
that
because
lord
rufford
has
engaged
himself
to
me
now
i
was
never
engaged
to
any
one
before
there
one
of
them
does
know
that
you
had
made
up
an
engagement
between
us
and
had
afterwards
tried
to
break
it
off
when
she
heard
this
the
unfortunate
mother
raved
but
she
raved
in
vain
she
told
her
daughter
that
she
would
not
supply
her
with
money
for
the
expenses
of
her
journey
but
her
daughter
replied
that
she
would
have
no
difficulty
in
finding
her
way
to
a
pawn
shop
what
is
to
be
got
by
it
asked
the
unfortunate
mother
in
reply
to
this
arabella
would
say
mamma
you
have
no
heart
absolutely
none
you
ought
to
manoeuvre
better
than
you
do
for
your
feelings
never
stand
in
your
way
for
a
moment
all
this
had
to
be
borne
and
the
old
woman
was
forced
at
last
not
only
to
yield
but
to
promise
that
she
would
accompany
her
daughter
to
bragton
i
know
how
all
this
will
end
she
said
to
arabella
you
will
have
to
go
your
way
and
i
must
go
mine
just
so
replied
the
daughter
i
do
not
often
agree
with
you
mamma
but
i
do
there
altogether
lady
augustus
was
absolutely
at
a
loss
to
understand
what
were
the
motives
and
what
the
ideas
which
induced
her
daughter
to
take
the
journey
if
the
man
were
to
die
no
good
could
come
of
it
if
he
were
to
live
then
surely
that
love
which
had
induced
him
to
make
so
foolish
a
petition
would
suffice
to
ensure
the
marriage
if
the
marriage
should
then
be
thought
desirable
but
at
the
present
moment
arabella
was
still
hot
in
pursuit
of
lord
rufford
to
whom
this
journey
as
soon
as
it
should
be
known
to
him
would
give
the
easiest
mode
of
escape
how
would
it
be
possible
that
they
two
should
get
out
at
the
dillsborough
station
and
be
taken
to
bragton
without
all
rufford
knowing
it
of
course
there
would
be
hymns
sung
in
praise
of
arabella
love
and
constancy
but
such
hymns
would
be
absolutely
ruinous
to
her
it
was
growing
clear
to
lady
augustus
that
her
daughter
was
giving
up
the
game
and
becoming
frantic
as
she
thought
of
her
age
her
failure
and
her
future
if
so
it
would
be
well
that
they
should
separate
on
the
day
fixed
a
close
carriage
awaited
them
at
the
dillsborough
station
they
arrived
both
dressed
in
black
and
both
veiled
and
with
but
one
maid
between
them
this
arrangement
had
been
made
with
some
vague
idea
of
escaping
scrutiny
rather
than
from
economy
they
had
never
hitherto
been
known
to
go
anywhere
without
one
apiece
there
were
no
airs
on
the
station
now
as
on
that
former
occasion
no
loud
talking
not
even
a
word
spoken
lady
augustus
was
asking
herself
why
why
she
should
have
been
put
into
so
lamentable
a
position
and
arabella
was
endeavouring
to
think
what
she
would
say
to
the
dying
man
she
did
think
that
he
was
dying
it
was
not
the
purport
of
her
present
visit
to
strengthen
her
position
by
making
certain
of
the
man
hand
should
he
live
when
she
said
that
she
was
not
as
yet
quite
so
as
her
mother
she
spoke
the
truth
something
of
regret
something
of
penitence
had
at
times
crept
over
her
in
reference
to
her
conduct
to
this
man
he
had
been
very
unlike
others
on
whom
she
had
played
her
arts
none
of
her
lovers
or
mock
lovers
had
been
serious
and
stern
and
uncomfortable
as
he
there
had
been
no
other
who
had
ever
attempted
to
earn
his
bread
to
her
the
butterflies
of
the
world
had
been
all
in
all
and
the
working
bees
had
been
a
tribe
apart
with
which
she
was
no
more
called
upon
to
mix
than
is
my
lady
spaniel
with
the
kennel
hounds
but
the
chance
had
come
she
had
consented
to
exhibit
her
allurements
before
a
man
of
business
and
the
man
of
business
had
at
once
sat
at
her
feet
she
had
soon
repented
as
the
reader
has
seen
the
alliance
had
been
distasteful
to
her
she
had
found
that
the
man
ways
were
in
no
wise
like
her
ways
and
she
had
found
also
that
were
she
to
become
his
wife
he
certainly
would
not
change
she
had
looked
about
for
a
means
of
escape
but
as
she
did
so
she
had
recognized
the
man
truth
no
doubt
he
had
been
different
from
the
others
less
gay
in
his
attire
less
jocund
in
his
words
less
given
to
flattery
and
sport
and
gems
and
all
the
little
wickednesses
which
she
had
loved
but
they
those
others
had
one
and
all
struggled
to
escape
from
her
through
all
the
gems
and
mirth
and
flattery
there
had
been
the
same
purpose
they
liked
the
softness
of
her
hand
they
liked
the
flutter
of
her
silk
they
liked
to
have
whispered
in
their
ears
the
bold
words
of
her
practised
raillery
each
liked
for
a
month
or
two
to
be
her
special
friend
but
then
after
that
each
had
deserted
her
as
had
done
the
one
before
till
in
each
new
alliance
she
felt
that
such
was
to
be
her
destiny
and
that
she
was
rolling
a
stone
which
would
never
settle
itself
straining
for
waters
which
would
never
come
lip
high
but
john
morton
after
once
saying
that
he
loved
her
had
never
tired
had
never
wished
to
escape
he
had
been
so
true
to
his
love
so
true
to
his
word
that
he
had
borne
from
her
usage
which
would
have
fully
justified
escape
had
escape
been
to
his
taste
but
to
the
last
he
had
really
loved
her
and
now
on
his
death
bed
he
had
sent
for
her
to
come
to
him
she
would
not
be
coward
enough
to
refuse
his
request
should
he
say
anything
to
you
about
his
will
do
refuse
to
hear
him
because
it
may
be
of
the
greatest
importance
lady
augustus
whispered
to
her
daughter
as
the
carriage
was
driven
up
to
the
front
door
it
was
then
four
and
it
was
understood
that
the
two
ladies
were
to
stay
that
one
night
at
bragton
a
letter
having
been
received
by
lady
ushant
that
morning
informing
her
that
the
mother
as
well
as
the
daughter
was
coming
poor
lady
ushant
was
almost
beside
herself
not
knowing
what
she
would
do
with
the
two
women
and
having
no
one
in
the
house
to
help
her
something
she
had
heard
of
lady
augustus
but
chiefly
from
hopkins
who
certainly
had
not
admired
her
master
future
nor
had
arabella
been
popular
but
of
her
hopkins
had
only
dared
to
say
that
she
was
very
handsome
and
a
little
upstartish
how
she
was
to
spend
the
evening
with
them
lady
ushant
could
not
conceive
it
having
been
decided
in
accordance
with
the
doctor
orders
that
the
interview
should
not
take
place
till
the
next
morning
when
they
were
shown
in
lady
ushant
stood
just
within
the
door
and
muttered
a
few
words
as
she
gave
her
hand
to
each
how
is
he
asked
arabella
throwing
up
her
veil
boldly
as
soon
as
the
door
was
closed
lady
ushant
only
shook
her
head
i
knew
it
would
be
so
it
is
always
so
with
anything
i
care
for
she
is
so
distressed
lady
ushant
said
the
mother
that
she
hardly
knows
what
she
does
arabella
shook
her
head
it
is
so
lady
ushant
am
i
to
go
to
him
now
said
arabella
then
the
old
lady
explained
the
doctor
orders
and
offered
to
take
them
to
their
rooms
perhaps
i
might
say
a
word
to
you
alone
i
will
stay
here
if
you
will
go
with
mamma
and
she
did
stay
till
lady
ushant
came
down
to
her
do
you
mean
to
say
it
is
certain
she
asked
certain
that
he
must
die
no
i
do
not
say
that
it
is
possible
that
he
may
recover
certainly
it
is
possible
what
is
not
possible
with
god
ah
that
means
that
he
will
die
then
she
sat
herself
down
and
almost
unconsciously
took
off
her
bonnet
and
laid
it
aside
lady
ushant
then
looking
into
her
face
for
the
first
time
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
what
she
had
heard
of
her
beauty
could
it
be
the
same
girl
of
whom
hopkins
had
spoken
and
of
whose
brilliant
beauty
reginald
had
repeated
what
he
had
heard
she
was
haggard
almost
old
with
black
lines
round
her
eyes
there
was
nothing
soft
or
gracious
in
the
tresses
of
her
hair
when
lady
ushant
had
been
young
men
had
liked
hair
such
as
was
that
of
mary
masters
arabella
yellow
locks
whencesoever
they
might
have
come
were
rough
and
uncombed
but
it
was
the
look
of
age
and
the
almost
masculine
strength
of
the
lower
face
which
astonished
lady
ushant
the
most
has
he
spoken
to
you
about
me
she
said
not
to
me
then
lady
ushant
went
on
to
explain
that
though
she
was
there
now
as
the
female
representative
of
the
family
she
had
never
been
so
intimate
with
john
morton
as
to
admit
of
such
confidence
as
that
suggested
i
wonder
whether
he
can
love
me
said
the
girl
assuredly
he
does
miss
trefoil
why
else
should
he
send
for
you
because
he
is
an
honest
man
i
hardly
think
that
he
can
love
me
much
he
was
to
have
been
my
husband
but
he
will
escape
that
if
i
thought
that
he
would
live
i
would
tell
him
that
he
was
free
he
would
not
want
to
be
free
he
ought
to
want
it
i
am
not
fit
for
him
i
have
come
here
lady
ushant
because
i
want
to
tell
him
the
truth
but
you
love
him
arabella
made
no
answer
but
sat
looking
steadily
into
lady
ushant
face
surely
you
do
love
him
i
do
not
know
i
do
think
i
did
love
him
though
now
i
may
it
is
so
horrible
that
he
should
die
and
die
while
all
this
is
going
on
that
softens
one
you
know
have
you
ever
heard
of
lord
rufford
lord
rufford
the
young
man
yes
the
young
man
never
particularly
i
knew
his
father
but
not
this
man
morton
never
spoke
to
you
of
him
not
a
word
i
have
been
engaged
to
him
since
i
became
engaged
to
your
nephew
engaged
to
lord
rufford
to
marry
him
yes
indeed
and
will
you
marry
him
i
can
not
say
i
tell
you
this
lady
ushant
because
i
must
tell
somebody
in
this
house
i
have
behaved
very
badly
to
morton
and
lord
rufford
is
behaving
as
badly
to
me
did
john
know
of
this
no
but
i
meant
to
tell
him
i
determined
that
i
would
tell
him
had
he
lived
when
he
sent
for
me
i
swore
that
i
would
tell
him
if
he
is
dying
how
can
i
say
it
lady
ushant
sat
bewildered
thinking
over
it
understanding
nothing
of
the
world
in
which
this
girl
had
lived
and
not
knowing
now
how
things
could
have
been
as
she
described
them
it
was
not
as
yet
three
months
since
to
her
knowledge
this
young
woman
had
been
staying
at
bragton
as
the
affianced
bride
of
the
owner
of
the
house
staying
there
with
her
own
mother
and
his
grandmother
and
now
she
declared
that
since
that
time
she
had
become
engaged
to
another
man
and
that
that
other
man
had
already
jilted
her
and
yet
she
was
here
that
she
might
make
a
deathbed
parting
with
the
man
who
regarded
himself
as
her
affianced
husband
if
i
were
sure
that
he
were
dying
why
should
i
trouble
him
she
said
again
lady
ushant
found
herself
utterly
unable
to
give
any
counsel
to
such
a
condition
of
circumstances
why
should
she
be
asked
this
young
woman
had
her
mother
with
her
did
her
mother
know
all
this
and
nevertheless
bring
her
daughter
to
the
house
of
a
man
who
had
been
so
treated
i
really
do
not
know
what
to
say
she
replied
at
last
but
i
was
determined
that
i
would
tell
some
one
i
thought
that
morton
would
have
been
here
lady
ushant
shook
her
head
i
am
glad
she
is
not
because
she
was
not
civil
to
me
when
i
was
here
before
she
would
have
said
hard
things
to
me
though
not
perhaps
harder
than
i
have
deserved
i
suppose
i
may
still
see
him
oh
yes
he
expects
it
i
shall
not
tell
him
now
i
could
not
tell
him
if
i
thought
he
were
dying
if
he
gets
better
you
must
tell
him
all
i
do
think
i
could
do
that
miss
trefoil
pray
do
pray
do
i
call
upon
you
to
tell
him
everything
tell
him
that
you
will
be
married
to
lord
rufford
no
not
that
if
morton
were
well
i
would
have
him
if
he
chose
to
take
me
after
what
i
have
told
you
you
do
love
him
then
at
any
rate
i
like
no
one
better
not
the
young
lord
no
why
should
i
like
him
he
does
not
love
me
i
hate
him
i
would
marry
morton
and
go
with
him
to
patagonia
or
anywhere
else
if
he
would
have
me
after
hearing
what
i
have
done
then
she
rose
from
her
chair
but
before
she
left
the
room
she
said
a
word
further
do
not
speak
a
word
to
my
mother
about
this
mamma
knows
nothing
of
my
purpose
mamma
only
wants
me
to
marry
lord
rufford
and
to
throw
morton
over
do
not
tell
anyone
else
lady
ushant
but
if
he
is
ever
well
enough
then
you
must
tell
him
after
that
she
went
leaving
lady
ushant
in
the
room
astounded
by
the
story
she
had
heard
volume
iii
chapter
i
i
have
told
him
everything
that
evening
was
very
long
and
very
sad
to
the
three
ladies
assembled
in
the
at
bragton
park
but
it
was
probably
more
so
to
lady
augustus
than
the
other
two
she
hardly
spoke
to
either
of
them
nor
did
they
to
her
while
a
certain
amount
of
conversation
in
a
low
tone
was
carried
on
between
lady
ushant
and
miss
trefoil
when
arabella
came
down
to
dinner
she
received
a
message
from
the
sick
man
he
sent
his
love
and
would
so
willingly
have
seen
her
instantly
only
that
the
doctor
would
not
allow
it
but
he
was
so
glad
so
very
glad
that
she
had
come
this
lady
ushant
said
to
her
in
a
whisper
and
seemed
to
say
it
as
though
she
had
heard
nothing
of
that
frightful
story
which
had
been
told
to
her
not
much
more
than
an
hour
ago
arabella
did
not
utter
a
word
in
reply
but
put
out
her
hand
secretly
as
it
were
and
grasped
that
of
the
old
lady
to
whom
she
had
told
the
tale
of
her
later
intrigues
the
dinner
did
not
keep
them
long
but
it
was
very
grievous
to
them
all
lady
ushant
might
have
made
some
effort
to
be
at
least
a
complaisant
hostess
to
lady
augustus
had
she
not
heard
this
story
had
she
not
been
told
that
the
woman
knowing
her
daughter
to
be
engaged
to
john
morton
had
wanted
her
to
marry
lord
rufford
the
story
having
come
from
the
lips
of
the
girl
herself
had
moved
some
pity
in
the
old
woman
breast
in
regard
to
her
but
for
lady
augustus
she
could
feel
nothing
but
horror
in
the
evening
lady
augustus
sat
alone
not
even
pretending
to
open
a
book
or
to
employ
her
fingers
she
seated
herself
on
one
side
of
the
fire
with
a
screen
in
her
hand
turning
over
such
thoughts
in
her
mind
as
were
perhaps
customary
to
her
would
there
ever
come
a
period
to
her
misery
an
hour
of
release
in
which
she
might
be
in
comfort
ere
she
died
hitherto
from
one
year
to
another
from
one
decade
to
the
following
it
had
all
been
struggle
and
misery
contumely
and
contempt
she
thought
that
she
had
done
her
duty
by
her
child
and
her
child
hated
and
despised
her
it
was
but
the
other
day
that
arabella
had
openly
declared
that
in
the
event
of
her
marriage
she
would
not
have
her
mother
as
a
guest
in
her
own
house
there
could
be
no
longer
hope
for
triumph
and
glory
but
how
might
she
find
peace
so
that
she
might
no
longer
be
driven
hither
and
thither
by
this
ungrateful
tyrant
child
oh
how
hard
she
had
worked
in
the
world
and
how
little
the
world
had
given
her
in
return
lady
ushant
and
arabella
sat
at
the
other
side
of
the
fire
at
some
distance
from
it
on
a
sofa
and
carried
on
a
fitful
conversation
in
whispers
of
which
a
word
would
now
and
then
reach
the
ears
of
the
wretched
mother
it
consisted
chiefly
of
a
description
of
the
illness
and
of
the
different
sayings
which
had
come
from
the
doctors
who
had
attended
him
it
was
marvellous
to
lady
augustus
as
she
sat
there
listening
that
her
daughter
should
condescend
to
take
an
interest
in
such
details
what
could
it
be
to
her
now
how
the
fever
had
taken
him
or
why
or
when
on
the
very
next
day
the
very
morning
on
which
she
would
go
and
sit
ah
so
uselessly
by
the
dying
bedside
her
father
was
to
meet
lord
rufford
at
the
ducal
mansion
in
piccadilly
to
see
if
anything
could
be
done
in
that
quarter
it
was
impossible
that
she
should
really
care
whether
john
morton
lease
of
life
was
to
be
computed
at
a
week
purchase
or
at
that
of
a
month
and
yet
arabella
sat
there
asking
questions
and
listening
to
replies
as
though
her
very
nature
had
been
changed
lady
augustus
heard
her
daughter
inquire
what
food
the
sick
man
took
and
then
lady
ushant
at
great
length
gave
the
list
of
his
nourishment
what
sickening
hypocrisy
thought
lady
augustus
lady
augustus
must
have
known
her
daughter
well
and
yet
it
was
not
hypocrisy
the
girl
nature
which
had
become
thoroughly
evil
from
the
treatment
it
had
received
was
not
altered
such
sudden
changes
do
not
occur
more
frequently
than
other
miracles
but
zealously
as
she
had
practised
her
arts
she
had
not
as
yet
practised
them
long
enough
not
to
be
cowed
by
certain
outward
circumstances
there
were
moments
when
she
still
heard
in
her
imagination
the
sound
of
that
horse
foot
as
it
struck
the
skull
of
the
unfortunate
fallen
rider
and
now
the
prospect
of
the
death
of
this
man
whom
she
had
known
so
intimately
and
who
had
behaved
so
well
to
her
to
whom
her
own
conduct
had
been
so
foully
false
for
a
time
brought
her
back
to
humanity
but
lady
augustus
had
got
beyond
that
and
could
not
at
all
understand
it
by
nine
they
had
all
retired
for
the
night
it
was
necessary
that
lady
ushant
should
again
visit
her
nephew
and
the
mother
and
daughter
went
to
their
own
rooms
i
can
not
in
the
least
make
out
what
you
are
doing
said
lady
augustus
in
her
most
severe
voice
i
dare
say
not
mamma
i
have
been
brought
here
at
a
terrible
sacrifice
sacrifice
what
sacrifice
you
are
as
well
here
as
anywhere
else
i
say
i
have
been
brought
here
at
a
terrible
sacrifice
for
no
purpose
whatever
what
use
is
it
to
be
and
then
you
pretend
to
care
what
this
poor
man
is
eating
and
drinking
and
what
physic
he
is
taking
when
the
last
time
you
were
in
his
company
you
would
so
much
as
look
at
him
for
fear
you
should
make
another
man
jealous
he
was
not
dying
then
psha
oh
yes
i
know
all
that
i
do
feel
a
little
ashamed
of
myself
when
i
am
almost
crying
for
him
as
if
you
loved
him
dear
mamma
i
do
own
that
it
is
foolish
having
listened
to
you
on
these
subjects
for
a
dozen
years
at
least
i
ought
to
have
got
rid
of
all
that
i
do
suppose
i
do
love
him
two
or
three
weeks
ago
i
almost
thought
i
loved
lord
rufford
and
now
i
am
quite
sure
that
i
hate
him
but
if
i
heard
that
he
had
broken
his
neck
out
hunting
i
ai
sure
but
what
i
should
feel
something
but
he
would
not
send
for
me
as
this
man
has
done
it
was
very
impertinent
perhaps
it
was
as
he
must
have
suspected
something
as
to
lord
rufford
however
we
are
here
now
i
will
never
allow
you
to
drag
me
anywhere
again
it
will
be
for
yourself
to
judge
of
that
if
i
want
to
go
anywhere
i
shall
go
what
the
good
of
quarrelling
you
know
that
i
mean
to
have
my
way
the
next
morning
neither
lady
augustus
nor
miss
trefoil
came
down
to
breakfast
but
at
ten
arabella
was
ready
as
appointed
to
be
taken
into
the
sick
man
bedroom
she
was
still
dressed
in
black
but
had
taken
some
trouble
with
her
face
and
hair
she
followed
lady
ushant
in
and
silently
standing
by
the
bedside
put
her
hand
upon
that
of
john
morton
which
was
laying
outside
on
the
bed
i
will
leave
you
now
john
said
lady
ushant
retiring
and
come
again
in
half
an
hour
when
i
ring
he
said
you
must
let
him
talk
for
more
than
that
said
the
old
lady
to
arabella
as
she
went
it
was
more
than
an
hour
afterwards
when
arabella
crept
into
her
mother
room
during
which
time
lady
ushant
had
twice
knocked
at
her
nephew
door
and
had
twice
been
sent
away
it
is
all
over
mamma
she
said
lady
augustus
looked
into
her
daughter
eyes
and
saw
that
she
had
really
been
weeping
all
over
i
mean
for
me
and
you
we
have
only
got
to
go
away
will
he
die
it
will
make
no
matter
though
he
should
live
for
ever
i
have
told
him
everything
i
did
not
mean
to
do
it
because
i
thought
that
he
would
be
weak
but
he
has
been
strong
enough
for
that
what
have
you
told
him
just
everything
about
you
and
lord
rufford
and
myself
and
what
an
escape
he
had
had
not
to
marry
me
he
understands
it
all
now
it
is
a
great
deal
more
than
i
do
he
knows
that
lord
rufford
has
been
engaged
to
me
she
clung
to
this
statement
so
vehemently
that
she
had
really
taught
herself
to
believe
that
it
was
so
well
and
he
knows
also
how
his
lordship
is
behaving
to
me
of
course
he
thinks
that
i
have
deserved
it
of
course
i
have
deserved
it
we
have
nothing
to
do
now
but
to
go
back
to
london
you
have
brought
me
here
all
the
way
for
that
only
for
that
as
the
man
was
dying
i
thought
that
i
would
be
honest
just
for
once
now
that
i
have
told
him
i
do
believe
that
he
will
die
he
does
not
look
to
be
so
very
and
you
have
thrown
away
that
chance
altogether
you
did
like
bragton
you
know
and
therefore
it
matter
to
you
like
it
to
be
sure
you
would
have
got
rid
of
me
had
i
gone
to
patagonia
but
he
will
not
go
to
patagonia
now
even
if
he
gets
well
and
so
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
the
carriage
is
to
be
here
at
two
to
take
us
to
the
station
and
you
may
as
well
let
judith
come
and
put
the
things
up
just
before
they
took
their
departure
lady
ushant
came
to
arabella
saying
that
morton
wanted
to
speak
one
other
word
to
her
before
she
went
so
she
returned
to
the
room
and
was
again
left
alone
at
the
man
bedside
arabella
he
said
i
thought
that
i
would
tell
you
that
i
have
forgiven
everything
how
can
you
have
forgiven
me
there
are
things
which
a
man
can
not
forgive
give
me
your
hand
he
said
and
she
gave
him
her
hand
i
do
forgive
it
all
even
should
i
live
it
would
be
impossible
that
we
should
be
man
and
wife
oh
yes
but
nevertheless
i
love
you
try
try
to
be
true
to
some
one
there
is
no
truth
left
in
me
morton
i
should
not
dishonour
my
husband
if
i
had
one
but
still
i
should
be
a
curse
to
him
i
shall
marry
some
day
i
suppose
and
i
know
it
will
be
so
i
wish
i
could
change
with
you
and
die
you
are
unhappy
now
indeed
i
am
i
am
always
unhappy
i
do
not
think
you
can
tell
what
it
is
to
be
so
wretched
but
i
am
glad
that
you
have
forgiven
me
then
she
stooped
down
and
kissed
his
hand
as
she
did
so
he
touched
her
brow
with
his
hot
lips
and
then
she
left
him
again
lady
ushant
was
waiting
outside
the
door
he
knows
it
all
said
arabella
you
need
not
trouble
yourself
with
the
message
i
gave
you
the
carriage
is
at
the
door
you
need
not
come
down
mamma
will
not
expect
it
lady
ushant
hardly
knowing
how
she
ought
to
behave
did
not
go
down
lady
augustus
and
her
daughter
got
into
carriage
without
any
farewells
and
were
driven
back
from
the
park
to
the
dillsborough
station
to
poor
lady
ushant
the
whole
thing
had
been
very
terrible
she
sat
silent
and
unoccupied
the
whole
of
that
evening
wondering
at
the
horror
of
such
a
history
this
girl
had
absolutely
dared
to
tell
the
dying
man
all
her
own
disgrace
and
had
travelled
down
from
london
to
bragton
with
the
purpose
of
doing
so
when
next
she
crept
into
the
she
almost
expected
that
her
nephew
would
speak
to
her
on
the
subject
but
he
only
asked
whether
that
sound
of
wheels
which
he
heard
beneath
his
window
had
come
from
the
carriage
which
had
taken
them
away
and
then
did
not
say
a
further
word
of
either
lady
augustus
or
her
daughter
and
what
do
you
mean
to
do
now
said
lady
augustus
as
the
train
approached
the
london
terminus
nothing
you
have
given
up
lord
rufford
indeed
i
have
not
your
journey
to
bragton
will
hardly
help
you
much
with
him
i
do
want
it
to
help
me
at
all
what
have
i
done
that
lord
rufford
can
complain
of
i
have
not
abandoned
lord
rufford
for
the
sake
of
morton
lord
rufford
ought
only
to
be
too
proud
if
he
knew
it
all
of
course
he
could
make
use
of
such
an
escapade
as
this
let
him
try
i
have
not
done
with
lord
rufford
yet
and
so
i
can
tell
him
i
shall
be
at
the
duke
in
piccadilly
morning
that
will
be
impossible
arabella
they
shall
see
whether
it
is
impossible
i
have
got
beyond
caring
very
much
what
people
say
now
i
know
the
kind
of
way
papa
would
be
thrown
over
if
there
is
no
one
there
to
back
him
i
shall
be
there
and
i
will
ask
lord
rufford
to
his
face
whether
we
did
not
become
engaged
when
we
were
at
mistletoe
they
wo
let
you
in
i
find
a
way
to
make
my
way
in
i
shall
never
be
his
wife
i
do
know
that
i
want
it
after
all
what
the
good
of
living
with
a
man
if
you
hate
each
other
or
living
apart
like
you
and
papa
he
has
income
enough
for
anything
exclaimed
lady
augustus
shocked
at
her
daughter
apparent
blindness
it
is
that
i
thinking
of
but
i
have
my
revenge
on
him
liar
to
write
and
say
that
i
had
made
a
mistake
he
had
not
the
courage
to
get
out
of
it
when
we
were
together
but
when
he
had
run
away
in
the
night
like
a
thief
and
got
into
his
own
house
then
he
could
write
and
say
that
i
had
made
a
mistake
i
have
sometimes
pitied
men
when
i
have
seen
girls
hunting
them
down
but
upon
my
word
they
deserve
it
this
renewal
of
spirit
did
something
to
comfort
lady
augustus
she
had
begun
to
fear
that
her
daughter
in
her
despair
would
abandon
altogether
the
one
pursuit
of
her
life
but
it
now
seemed
that
there
was
still
some
courage
left
for
the
battle
that
night
nothing
more
was
said
but
arabella
applied
all
her
mind
to
the
present
condition
of
her
circumstances
should
she
or
should
she
not
go
to
the
house
in
piccadilly
on
the
following
morning
at
last
she
determined
that
she
would
not
do
so
believing
that
should
her
father
fail
she
might
make
a
better
opportunity
for
herself
afterwards
at
her
uncle
house
she
would
hardly
have
known
where
or
how
to
wait
for
the
proper
moment
of
her
appearance
so
you
are
not
going
to
piccadilly
said
her
mother
on
the
following
morning
it
appears
not
said
arabella
chapter
ii
now
what
have
you
got
to
say
it
may
be
a
question
whether
lord
augustus
trefoil
or
lord
rufford
looked
forward
to
the
interview
which
was
to
take
place
at
the
mansion
with
the
greater
dismay
the
unfortunate
father
whose
only
principle
in
life
had
been
that
of
avoiding
trouble
would
have
rather
that
his
daughter
should
have
been
jilted
a
score
of
times
than
that
he
should
have
been
called
upon
to
interfere
once
there
was
in
this
demand
upon
him
a
breach
of
a
silent
but
compact
his
wife
and
daughter
had
been
allowed
to
do
just
what
they
pleased
and
to
be
free
of
his
authority
upon
an
understanding
that
they
were
never
to
give
him
any
trouble
she
might
have
married
lord
rufford
or
morton
or
any
other
man
she
might
have
succeeded
in
catching
and
he
would
not
have
troubled
her
either
before
or
after
her
marriage
but
it
was
not
fair
that
he
should
be
called
upon
to
interfere
in
her
failures
and
what
was
he
to
say
to
this
young
lord
being
fat
and
old
and
plethoric
he
could
not
be
expected
to
use
a
stick
and
thrash
the
young
lord
pistols
were
gone
a
remembrance
of
which
fact
perhaps
afforded
some
consolation
nobody
now
need
be
afraid
of
anybody
and
the
young
lord
would
not
be
afraid
of
him
arabella
declared
that
there
had
been
an
engagement
the
young
lord
would
of
course
declare
that
there
had
been
none
upon
the
whole
he
was
inclined
to
believe
it
most
probable
that
his
daughter
was
lying
he
did
not
think
it
likely
that
lord
rufford
should
have
been
such
a
fool
as
for
taking
lord
rufford
by
the
back
of
his
neck
and
shaking
him
into
matrimony
he
knew
that
that
would
be
altogether
out
of
his
power
and
then
the
hour
was
so
wretchedly
early
it
was
that
little
fool
mistletoe
who
had
named
ten
a
fellow
who
took
parliamentary
papers
to
bed
with
him
and
had
a
blue
book
brought
to
him
every
morning
at
seven
with
a
cup
of
tea
by
ten
lord
augustus
would
not
have
had
time
to
take
his
first
glass
of
soda
and
brandy
preparatory
to
the
labour
of
getting
into
his
clothes
but
he
was
afraid
of
his
wife
and
daughter
and
absolutely
did
get
into
a
cab
at
the
door
of
his
lodgings
in
duke
street
james
precisely
at
a
quarter
past
ten
as
the
duke
house
was
close
to
the
corner
of
clarges
street
the
journey
he
had
to
make
was
not
long
lord
rufford
would
not
have
agreed
to
the
interview
but
that
it
was
forced
upon
him
by
his
what
good
can
it
do
lord
rufford
had
asked
but
his
had
held
that
that
was
a
question
to
be
answered
by
the
other
side
in
such
a
position
sir
george
thought
that
he
was
bound
to
concede
as
much
as
this
in
fact
to
concede
almost
anything
short
of
marriage
he
ca
do
the
girl
any
good
by
talking
lord
rufford
had
said
sir
george
assented
to
this
but
nevertheless
thought
that
any
friend
deputed
by
her
should
be
allowed
to
talk
at
any
rate
once
i
do
know
what
he
say
do
you
think
he
bring
a
big
stick
sir
george
who
knew
lord
augustus
did
not
imagine
that
a
stick
would
be
brought
i
hit
him
you
know
he
so
fat
that
a
blow
would
kill
him
lord
rufford
wanted
his
to
go
with
him
but
sir
george
assured
him
that
this
was
impossible
it
was
a
great
bore
he
had
to
go
up
to
london
all
alone
in
february
when
the
weather
was
quite
open
and
hunting
was
nearly
coming
to
an
end
and
for
what
was
it
likely
that
such
a
man
as
lord
augustus
should
succeed
in
talking
him
into
marrying
any
girl
nevertheless
he
went
prepared
to
be
very
civil
full
of
sorrow
at
the
misunderstanding
but
strong
in
his
determination
not
to
yield
an
inch
he
arrived
at
the
mansion
precisely
at
ten
and
was
at
once
shown
into
a
back
room
on
the
ground
floor
he
saw
no
one
but
a
very
demure
old
servant
who
seemed
to
look
upon
him
as
one
who
was
sinning
against
the
trefoil
family
in
general
and
who
shut
the
door
upon
him
leaving
him
as
it
were
in
prison
he
was
so
accustomed
to
be
the
absolute
master
of
his
own
minutes
and
hours
that
he
chafed
greatly
as
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
for
what
seemed
to
him
the
greater
part
of
a
day
he
looked
repeatedly
at
his
watch
and
at
ten
declared
to
himself
that
if
that
fat
old
fool
did
not
come
within
two
minutes
he
would
make
his
escape
the
fat
old
fool
when
he
reached
the
house
asked
for
his
nephew
and
endeavoured
to
persuade
lord
mistletoe
to
go
with
him
to
the
interview
but
lord
mistletoe
was
as
firm
in
refusing
as
had
been
sir
george
penwether
you
are
quite
wrong
said
the
young
man
with
sententious
gravity
i
could
do
nothing
to
help
you
you
are
arabella
father
and
no
one
can
plead
her
cause
but
yourself
lord
augustus
dropped
his
eyebrows
over
his
eyes
as
this
was
said
they
who
knew
him
well
and
had
seen
the
same
thing
done
when
his
partner
would
not
answer
his
call
at
whist
or
had
led
up
to
his
discard
were
aware
that
the
motion
was
tantamount
to
a
very
strong
expression
of
disgust
he
did
not
however
argue
the
matter
any
further
but
allowed
himself
to
be
led
away
slowly
by
the
same
solemn
servant
lord
rufford
had
taken
up
his
hat
preparatory
to
his
departure
when
lord
augustus
was
announced
just
five
minutes
after
the
half
hour
when
the
elder
man
entered
the
room
the
younger
one
put
down
his
hat
and
bowed
lord
augustus
also
bowed
and
then
stood
for
a
few
moments
silent
with
his
fat
hands
extended
on
the
round
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
this
is
a
very
disagreeable
kind
of
thing
my
lord
he
said
very
disagreeable
and
one
that
i
lament
above
all
things
answered
lord
rufford
that
all
very
well
very
well
indeed
but
damme
what
the
meaning
of
it
all
that
what
i
want
to
ask
what
the
meaning
of
it
all
then
he
paused
as
though
he
had
completed
the
first
part
of
his
business
and
might
now
wait
awhile
till
the
necessary
explanation
had
been
given
but
lord
rufford
did
not
seem
disposed
to
give
any
immediate
answer
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
taking
up
his
hat
passed
his
hand
once
or
twice
round
the
nap
lord
augustus
opened
his
eyes
very
wide
as
he
waited
and
looked
at
the
other
man
but
it
seemed
that
the
other
man
had
nothing
to
say
for
himself
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
i
suppose
that
what
my
daughter
says
true
some
unfortunate
mistake
lord
augustus
most
unfortunate
mistake
be
he
stopped
himself
before
the
sentence
was
completed
remembering
that
such
an
interview
should
be
conducted
on
the
part
of
him
as
father
with
something
of
dignity
i
understand
anything
about
mistakes
ladies
do
make
mistakes
of
that
kind
i
wo
hear
of
mistakes
lord
rufford
again
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
have
engaged
my
daughter
affections
i
have
the
greatest
regard
for
miss
trefoil
regard
be
then
again
he
remembered
himself
lord
rufford
you
got
to
marry
her
that
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
i
sure
i
ought
to
be
proud
so
you
ought
but
i
do
know
the
meaning
of
but
my
lord
i
want
to
know
what
you
mean
to
do
marriage
is
in
my
line
at
all
then
what
the
d
business
have
you
to
go
about
and
talk
to
a
girl
like
that
marriage
not
in
your
line
who
cares
for
your
line
i
never
heard
such
impudence
in
all
my
life
you
get
yourself
engaged
to
a
young
lady
of
high
rank
and
position
and
then
you
say
that
marriage
is
in
your
line
upon
that
he
opened
his
eyes
still
wider
and
glared
upon
the
offender
wrathfully
i
ca
admit
that
i
was
ever
engaged
to
miss
trefoil
did
you
make
love
to
her
the
poor
victim
paused
a
moment
before
he
answered
this
question
thereby
confessing
his
guilt
before
he
denied
it
no
my
lord
i
do
think
i
ever
did
you
do
think
you
do
know
whether
you
asked
my
daughter
to
marry
you
or
not
you
do
think
you
made
love
to
her
i
am
sure
i
did
ask
her
to
marry
me
i
am
sure
you
did
and
now
what
have
you
got
to
say
here
there
was
another
shrug
of
the
shoulders
i
suppose
you
think
because
you
are
a
rich
man
that
you
may
do
whatever
you
please
but
you
have
to
learn
the
difference
you
must
be
exposed
sir
i
hope
for
the
lady
sake
that
as
little
as
possible
may
be
said
of
it
d
the
lord
augustus
in
his
assumed
wrath
was
about
to
be
very
severe
on
his
daughter
but
he
checked
himself
again
i
not
going
to
stop
here
talking
all
day
he
said
i
want
to
hear
your
explanation
and
then
i
shall
know
how
to
act
up
to
this
time
he
had
been
standing
which
was
unusual
with
him
now
he
flung
himself
into
an
armchair
really
lord
augustus
i
do
know
what
i
got
to
say
i
admire
your
daughter
exceedingly
i
was
very
much
honoured
when
she
and
her
mother
came
to
my
house
at
rufford
i
was
delighted
to
be
able
to
show
her
a
little
sport
it
gave
me
the
greatest
satisfaction
when
i
met
her
again
at
your
brother
house
coming
home
from
hunting
we
happened
to
be
thrown
together
it
a
kind
of
thing
that
will
occur
you
know
the
duchess
seemed
to
think
a
great
deal
of
it
but
what
can
one
do
we
could
have
had
two
postchaises
of
course
only
one
does
generally
send
a
young
lady
alone
she
was
very
tired
and
fainted
with
the
fatigue
that
i
think
is
about
all
but
damme
sir
what
did
you
say
to
her
lord
rufford
again
rubbed
the
nap
of
his
hat
what
did
you
say
to
her
first
of
all
at
your
own
house
a
poor
fellow
was
killed
out
hunting
and
everybody
was
talking
about
that
your
daughter
saw
it
herself
excuse
me
lord
rufford
if
i
say
that
that
what
we
used
to
call
shuffling
at
school
because
a
man
broke
his
neck
out
hunting
it
was
a
kick
on
the
head
lord
augustus
i
do
care
where
he
was
kicked
what
has
that
to
do
with
your
asking
my
daughter
to
be
your
wife
but
i
did
i
say
you
did
over
and
over
again
here
lord
augustus
got
out
of
his
chair
and
made
a
little
attempt
to
reach
the
recreant
lover
but
he
failed
and
fell
back
again
into
his
armchair
it
was
first
at
rufford
and
then
you
made
an
appointment
to
meet
her
at
mistletoe
how
do
you
explain
that
miss
trefoil
is
very
fond
of
hunting
i
do
believe
she
ever
went
out
hunting
in
her
life
before
she
saw
you
you
mounted
her
and
gave
her
a
horse
and
took
her
out
and
brought
her
home
everybody
at
mistletoe
knew
all
about
it
my
brother
and
the
duchess
were
told
of
it
it
was
one
of
those
things
that
are
plain
to
everybody
as
the
nose
on
your
face
what
did
you
say
to
her
when
you
were
coming
home
in
that
postchaise
she
was
fainting
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
i
do
care
whether
she
fainted
or
not
i
do
believe
she
fainted
at
all
when
she
got
into
that
carriage
she
was
engaged
to
you
and
when
she
got
out
of
it
she
was
engaged
ever
so
much
more
the
duchess
knew
all
about
it
now
what
have
you
got
to
say
lord
rufford
felt
that
he
had
nothing
to
say
i
insist
upon
having
an
answer
it
one
of
the
most
unfortunate
mistakes
that
ever
were
made
by
g
exclaimed
lord
augustus
turning
his
eyes
up
against
the
wall
and
appealing
to
some
dark
ancestor
who
hung
there
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
in
all
my
life
never
i
suppose
i
might
as
well
go
now
said
lord
rufford
after
a
pause
you
may
go
to
the
d
sir
for
the
present
then
lord
rufford
took
his
departure
leaving
the
injured
parent
panting
with
his
exertions
as
lord
rufford
went
away
he
felt
that
that
difficulty
had
been
overcome
with
much
more
ease
than
he
had
expected
he
hardly
knew
what
it
was
that
he
had
dreaded
but
he
had
feared
something
much
worse
than
that
had
an
appeal
been
made
to
his
affections
he
would
hardly
have
known
how
to
answer
he
remembered
well
that
he
had
assured
the
lady
that
he
loved
her
and
had
a
direct
question
been
asked
him
on
that
subject
he
would
not
have
lied
he
must
have
confessed
that
such
a
declaration
had
been
made
by
him
but
he
had
escaped
that
he
was
quite
sure
that
he
had
never
uttered
a
hint
in
regard
to
marriage
and
he
came
away
from
the
duke
house
almost
with
an
assurance
that
he
had
done
nothing
that
was
worthy
of
much
blame
lord
augustus
looked
at
his
watch
rang
the
bell
and
ordered
a
cab
he
must
now
go
and
see
his
daughter
and
then
he
would
have
done
with
the
matter
for
ever
but
as
he
was
passing
through
the
hall
his
nephew
caught
hold
of
him
and
took
him
back
into
the
room
what
does
he
say
for
himself
asked
lord
mistletoe
i
do
know
what
he
says
of
course
he
swears
that
he
never
spoke
a
word
to
her
my
mother
saw
him
paying
her
the
closest
attention
how
can
i
help
that
what
can
i
do
why
did
your
mother
pin
him
then
and
there
women
can
always
do
that
kind
of
thing
if
they
choose
it
is
all
over
then
i
ca
make
a
man
marry
if
he
wo
he
ought
to
be
thrashed
within
an
inch
of
his
life
but
if
one
does
that
kind
of
thing
the
police
are
down
upon
one
all
the
same
i
think
the
duchess
might
have
managed
it
if
she
had
chosen
after
that
he
went
to
the
lodgings
in
orchard
street
and
there
repeated
his
story
i
have
done
all
i
can
he
said
and
i
do
mean
to
interfere
any
further
arabella
should
know
how
to
manage
her
own
affairs
and
you
do
mean
to
punish
him
asked
the
mother
punish
him
how
am
i
to
punish
him
if
i
were
to
throw
a
decanter
at
his
head
what
good
would
that
do
and
you
mean
to
say
that
she
must
put
up
with
it
arabella
was
sitting
by
as
these
questions
were
asked
he
says
that
he
never
said
a
word
to
her
whom
am
i
to
believe
you
did
believe
him
papa
who
said
so
miss
but
i
do
see
why
his
word
is
as
good
as
yours
there
was
nobody
to
hear
it
i
suppose
why
did
you
get
it
in
writing
or
make
your
uncle
fix
him
at
once
if
you
mismanage
your
own
affairs
i
ca
put
them
right
for
you
thank
you
papa
i
am
so
much
obliged
to
you
you
come
back
and
tell
me
that
every
word
he
says
is
to
be
taken
for
gospel
and
that
you
do
believe
a
word
i
have
spoken
that
is
so
kind
of
you
i
suppose
he
and
you
will
be
the
best
friends
in
the
world
now
but
i
mean
to
let
him
off
in
that
way
as
you
wo
help
me
i
must
help
myself
what
did
you
expect
me
to
do
never
to
leave
him
till
you
had
forced
him
to
keep
his
word
i
should
have
thought
that
you
would
have
taken
him
by
the
throat
in
such
a
cause
any
other
father
would
have
done
so
you
are
an
impudent
wicked
girl
and
i
do
believe
he
was
ever
engaged
to
you
at
all
said
lord
augustus
as
he
took
his
leave
now
you
have
made
your
father
your
enemy
said
the
mother
everybody
is
my
enemy
said
arabella
there
are
no
such
things
as
love
and
friendship
papa
pretends
that
he
does
not
believe
me
just
because
he
wants
to
shirk
the
trouble
i
suppose
you
say
you
believe
me

chapter
iii
morton
returns
a
few
days
after
that
on
which
lady
augustus
and
her
daughter
left
bragton
old
morton
returned
to
that
place
she
had
gone
away
in
very
bitterness
of
spirit
against
her
grandson
in
the
early
days
of
his
illness
for
some
period
antecedent
to
that
there
had
been
causes
for
quarrelling
john
morton
had
told
her
that
he
had
been
to
reginald
house
and
she
in
her
wrath
replied
that
he
had
disgraced
himself
by
doing
so
when
those
harsh
words
had
been
forgotten
or
at
any
rate
forgiven
other
causes
of
anger
had
sprung
up
she
had
endeavoured
to
drive
him
to
repudiate
arabella
trefoil
and
in
order
that
she
might
do
so
effectually
had
contrived
to
find
out
something
of
arabella
doings
at
rufford
and
at
mistletoe
her
efforts
in
this
direction
had
had
an
effect
directly
contrary
to
that
which
she
had
intended
there
had
been
moments
in
which
morton
had
been
willing
enough
to
rid
himself
of
that
burden
he
had
felt
the
lady
conduct
in
his
own
house
and
had
seen
it
at
rufford
he
too
had
heard
something
of
mistletoe
but
the
spirit
within
him
was
aroused
at
the
idea
of
dictation
and
he
had
been
prompted
to
contradict
the
old
woman
accusation
against
his
intended
bride
by
the
very
fact
that
they
were
made
by
her
and
then
she
threatened
him
if
he
did
these
things
if
he
would
consort
with
an
outcast
from
the
family
such
as
reginald
morton
and
take
to
himself
such
a
bride
as
arabella
trefoil
he
could
never
more
be
to
her
as
her
child
this
of
course
was
tantamount
to
saying
that
she
would
leave
her
money
to
some
one
else
money
which
as
he
well
knew
had
all
been
collected
from
the
bragton
property
he
had
ever
been
to
her
as
her
son
and
yet
he
was
aware
of
a
propensity
on
her
part
to
enrich
her
own
noble
relatives
with
her
hoards
a
desire
from
gratifying
which
she
had
hitherto
been
restrained
by
conscience
morton
had
been
anxious
enough
for
his
grandmother
money
but
even
in
the
hope
of
receiving
it
would
not
bear
indignity
beyond
a
certain
point
he
had
therefore
declared
it
to
be
his
purpose
to
marry
arabella
trefoil
and
because
he
had
so
declared
he
had
almost
brought
himself
to
forgive
that
young
lady
sins
against
him
then
as
his
illness
became
serious
there
arose
the
question
of
disposing
of
the
property
in
the
event
of
his
death
morton
was
herself
very
old
and
was
near
her
grave
she
was
apt
to
speak
of
herself
as
one
who
had
but
a
few
days
left
to
her
in
this
world
but
to
her
property
was
more
important
than
life
or
death
and
rank
probably
more
important
than
either
she
was
a
brave
fierce
but
conscientious
old
woman
one
we
may
say
with
very
bad
lights
indeed
but
who
was
steadfastly
minded
to
walk
by
those
lights
such
as
they
were
she
did
not
scruple
to
tell
her
grandson
that
it
was
his
duty
to
leave
the
property
away
from
his
cousin
reginald
nor
to
allege
as
a
reason
for
his
doing
so
that
in
all
probability
reginald
morton
was
not
the
legitimate
heir
of
his
sir
reginald
for
such
an
assertion
john
morton
knew
there
was
not
a
shadow
of
ground
no
one
but
this
old
woman
had
ever
suspected
that
the
canadian
girl
whom
reginald
father
had
brought
with
him
to
bragton
had
been
other
than
his
honest
wife
and
her
suspicions
had
only
come
from
vague
assertions
made
by
herself
in
blind
anger
till
at
last
she
had
learned
to
believe
them
then
when
in
addition
to
this
he
asserted
his
purpose
of
asking
arabella
trefoil
to
come
to
him
at
bragton
the
cup
of
her
wrath
was
overflowing
and
she
withdrew
from
the
house
altogether
it
might
be
that
he
was
dying
she
did
in
truth
believe
that
he
was
dying
but
there
were
things
more
serious
to
her
than
life
or
death
should
she
allow
him
to
trample
upon
all
her
feelings
because
he
was
on
his
when
perhaps
in
very
truth
he
might
not
be
on
his
at
all
she
at
any
rate
was
near
her
death
and
she
would
do
her
duty
so
she
packed
up
her
things
to
the
last
black
skirt
of
an
old
gown
so
that
every
one
at
bragton
might
know
that
it
was
her
purpose
to
come
back
no
more
and
she
went
away
then
lady
ushant
came
to
take
her
place
and
with
lady
ushant
came
reginald
morton
the
one
lived
in
the
house
and
the
other
visited
it
daily
and
as
the
reader
knows
lady
augustus
came
with
her
daughter
morton
though
she
had
gone
for
ever
took
care
to
know
of
the
comings
and
goings
at
bragton
hopkins
was
enjoined
to
write
to
her
and
tell
her
everything
and
though
hopkins
with
all
her
heart
took
the
side
of
lady
ushant
and
reginald
she
had
never
been
well
inclined
to
miss
trefoil
presents
too
were
given
and
promises
were
made
and
hopkins
not
without
some
little
treachery
did
from
time
to
time
send
to
the
old
lady
a
record
of
what
took
place
at
bragton
arabella
came
and
went
and
hopkins
thought
that
her
coming
had
not
led
to
much
lady
ushant
was
always
with
john
such
was
the
account
given
by
hopkins
and
the
general
opinion
was
that
the
squire
days
were
numbered
then
the
old
woman
jealousy
was
aroused
and
perhaps
her
heart
was
softened
it
was
still
hard
black
winter
and
she
was
living
alone
in
lodgings
in
london
the
noble
cousin
a
man
nearly
as
old
as
herself
whose
children
she
was
desirous
to
enrich
took
but
little
notice
of
her
nor
would
she
have
been
happy
had
she
lived
with
him
her
life
had
been
usually
solitary
with
little
breaks
to
its
loneliness
occasioned
by
the
visits
to
england
of
him
whom
she
had
called
her
child
that
this
child
should
die
before
her
should
die
in
his
youth
did
not
shock
her
much
her
husband
had
done
so
and
her
own
son
and
sundry
of
her
noble
brothers
and
sisters
she
was
hardened
against
death
life
to
her
had
never
been
joyous
though
the
trappings
of
life
were
so
great
in
her
eyes
but
it
broke
her
heart
that
her
child
should
die
in
the
arms
of
another
old
woman
who
had
always
been
to
her
as
an
enemy
lady
ushant
in
days
now
long
gone
by
but
still
remembered
as
though
they
were
yesterday
had
counselled
the
reception
of
the
canadian
female
and
lady
ushant
when
the
canadian
female
and
her
husband
were
dead
had
been
a
mother
to
the
boy
whom
she
morton
would
so
fain
have
repudiated
altogether
lady
ushant
had
always
been
on
the
other
side
and
now
lady
ushant
was
paramount
at
bragton
and
doubtless
there
was
some
tenderness
though
morton
was
unwilling
to
own
even
to
herself
that
she
was
moved
by
any
such
feeling
if
she
had
done
her
duty
in
counselling
him
to
reject
both
reginald
morton
and
arabella
trefoil
as
to
which
she
admitted
no
doubt
in
her
own
mind
and
if
duty
had
required
her
to
absent
herself
when
her
counsel
was
spurned
then
would
she
be
weak
and
unmindful
of
duty
should
she
allow
any
softness
of
heart
to
lure
her
back
again
it
was
so
she
reasoned
but
still
some
softness
was
there
and
when
she
heard
that
miss
trefoil
had
gone
and
that
her
visit
had
not
in
hopkins
opinion
led
to
much
she
wrote
to
say
that
she
would
return
she
made
no
request
and
clothed
her
suggestion
in
no
words
of
tenderness
but
simply
told
her
grandson
that
she
would
come
back
as
the
trefoils
had
left
him
and
she
did
come
when
the
news
were
first
told
to
lady
ushant
by
the
sick
man
himself
that
lady
proposed
that
she
should
at
once
go
back
to
cheltenham
but
when
she
was
asked
whether
her
animosity
to
morton
was
so
great
that
she
could
not
consent
to
remain
under
the
same
roof
she
at
once
declared
that
she
had
no
animosity
whatsoever
the
idea
of
animosity
running
over
nearly
half
a
century
was
horrible
to
her
and
therefore
though
she
did
in
her
heart
of
hearts
dread
the
other
old
woman
she
consented
to
stay
and
what
shall
reginald
do
she
asked
john
morton
had
thought
about
this
too
and
expressed
a
wish
that
reginald
should
come
regularly
as
he
had
come
during
the
last
week
or
two
it
was
just
a
week
from
the
day
on
which
the
trefoils
had
gone
that
morton
was
driven
up
to
the
door
in
runciman
fly
this
was
at
four
in
the
afternoon
and
had
the
old
woman
looked
out
of
the
fly
window
she
might
have
seen
reginald
making
his
way
by
the
little
path
to
the
bridge
which
led
back
to
dillsborough
it
was
at
this
hour
that
he
went
daily
and
he
had
not
now
thought
it
worth
his
while
to
remain
to
welcome
morton
and
she
might
also
have
seen
had
she
looked
out
that
with
him
was
walking
a
young
woman
she
would
not
have
known
mary
masters
but
had
she
seen
them
both
and
had
she
known
the
young
woman
she
would
have
declared
in
her
pride
that
they
were
fit
associates
but
she
saw
nothing
of
this
sitting
there
behind
her
veil
thinking
whether
she
might
still
do
anything
and
if
so
what
she
might
do
to
avert
the
present
evil
destination
of
the
bragton
estate
there
was
an
honourable
nephew
of
her
own
or
rather
a
who
might
easily
take
the
name
who
would
so
willingly
take
the
name
or
if
this
were
impracticable
there
was
a
distant
morton
very
distant
whom
she
had
never
seen
and
certainly
did
not
love
but
who
was
clearly
a
morton
and
who
would
certainly
be
preferable
to
that
enemy
of
forty
years
standing
might
there
not
be
some
bargain
made
would
not
her
dying
grandson
be
alive
to
the
evident
duty
of
enriching
the
property
and
leaving
behind
him
a
wealthy
heir
she
could
enrich
the
property
and
make
the
heir
wealthy
by
her
money
how
is
he
that
of
course
was
the
first
question
when
hopkins
met
her
in
the
hall
hopkins
only
shook
her
head
and
said
that
perhaps
he
had
taken
his
food
that
day
a
little
better
than
on
the
last
then
there
was
a
whisper
to
which
hopkins
whispered
back
her
answer
yes
lady
ushant
was
in
the
house
was
at
this
moment
in
the
sick
man
room
reginald
was
not
staying
there
had
never
stayed
there
but
came
every
day
he
had
only
just
left
and
is
he
to
come
still
asked
morton
with
wrath
in
her
eyes
hopkins
did
not
know
but
was
disposed
to
think
that
reginald
would
come
every
day
then
morton
went
up
to
her
own
room
and
while
she
prepared
herself
for
her
visit
to
the
sick
room
lady
ushant
retired
she
had
a
cup
of
tea
refusing
all
other
refreshment
and
then
walking
erect
as
though
she
had
been
forty
instead
of
she
entered
her
grandson
chamber
and
took
her
old
place
at
his
bedside
nothing
was
then
said
about
arabella
nor
indeed
at
any
future
time
was
her
name
mentioned
between
them
nor
was
anything
then
said
about
the
future
fate
of
the
estate
she
did
not
dare
to
bring
up
the
subject
at
once
though
on
the
journey
down
from
london
she
had
determined
that
she
would
do
so
but
she
was
awed
by
his
appearance
and
by
the
increased
appanages
of
his
he
spoke
indeed
of
the
property
and
expressed
his
anxiety
that
chowton
farm
should
be
bought
if
it
came
into
market
he
thought
that
the
old
acres
should
be
redeemed
if
the
opportunity
arose
and
if
the
money
could
be
found
chowton
farm
exclaimed
the
old
woman
who
remembered
well
the
agony
which
had
attended
the
alienation
of
that
portion
of
the
morton
lands
it
may
be
that
it
will
be
sold
lawrence
twentyman
sell
chowton
farm
i
thought
he
was
well
off
little
as
she
had
been
at
bragton
she
knew
all
about
chowton
farm
except
that
its
owner
was
so
wounded
by
vain
love
as
to
be
like
a
hurt
deer
her
grandson
did
not
tell
her
all
the
story
but
explained
to
her
that
lawrence
twentyman
though
not
poor
had
other
plans
of
life
and
thought
of
leaving
the
neighbourhood
she
of
course
had
the
money
and
as
she
believed
that
land
was
the
one
proper
possession
for
an
english
gentleman
of
ancient
family
she
doubtless
would
have
been
willing
to
buy
it
had
she
approved
of
the
hands
into
which
it
would
fall
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
was
her
duty
to
do
as
much
for
the
estate
with
which
all
her
fortune
had
been
concerned
yes
she
said
it
should
be
bought
if
other
things
suited
we
will
talk
of
it
john
then
he
spoke
of
his
mission
to
patagonia
and
of
his
regret
that
it
should
be
abandoned
even
were
he
ever
to
be
well
again
his
strength
would
return
to
him
too
late
for
this
purpose
he
had
already
made
known
to
the
foreign
office
his
inability
to
undertake
that
service
but
she
could
perceive
that
he
had
not
in
truth
abandoned
his
hopes
of
living
for
he
spoke
much
of
his
ambition
as
to
the
public
service
the
more
he
thought
of
it
he
said
the
more
certain
he
became
that
it
would
suit
him
better
to
go
on
with
his
profession
than
to
live
the
life
of
a
country
squire
in
england
and
yet
she
could
see
the
change
which
had
taken
place
since
she
was
last
there
and
was
aware
that
he
was
fading
away
from
day
to
day
it
was
not
till
they
were
summoned
to
dine
together
that
she
saw
lady
ushant
very
many
years
had
passed
since
last
they
were
together
and
yet
neither
seemed
to
the
other
to
be
much
changed
lady
ushant
was
still
soft
retiring
and
almost
timid
whereas
morton
showed
her
inclination
to
domineer
even
in
the
way
in
which
she
helped
herself
to
salt
while
the
servant
was
with
them
very
little
was
said
on
either
side
there
was
a
word
or
two
from
morton
to
show
that
she
considered
herself
the
mistress
there
and
a
word
from
the
other
lady
proclaiming
that
she
had
no
pretensions
of
that
kind
but
after
dinner
in
the
little
they
were
more
communicative
something
of
course
was
said
as
to
the
health
of
the
invalid
lady
ushant
was
not
the
woman
to
give
a
pronounced
opinion
on
such
a
subject
she
used
doubtful
hesitating
words
and
would
in
one
minute
almost
contradict
what
she
had
said
in
the
former
but
morton
was
clever
enough
to
perceive
that
lady
ushant
was
almost
without
hope
then
she
made
a
little
speech
with
a
fixed
purpose
it
must
be
a
great
trouble
to
you
lady
ushant
to
be
so
long
away
from
home
not
at
all
said
lady
ushant
in
perfect
innocence
i
have
nothing
to
bind
me
anywhere
i
shall
think
it
my
duty
to
remain
here
now
till
the
end
i
suppose
so
he
has
always
been
almost
the
same
to
you
as
your
own
quite
so
quite
the
same
he
is
my
own
and
yet
thought
lady
ushant
she
left
him
in
his
illness
she
too
had
heard
something
from
hopkins
of
the
temper
in
which
morton
had
last
left
bragton
but
you
are
not
bound
to
him
in
that
way
not
in
that
way
certainly
in
no
way
i
may
say
it
was
very
kind
of
you
to
come
when
business
made
it
imperative
on
me
to
go
to
town
but
i
do
not
think
we
can
call
upon
you
for
further
sacrifice
it
is
no
sacrifice
mrs
morton
lady
ushant
was
as
meek
as
a
worm
but
a
worm
will
turn
and
though
innocent
she
was
quick
enough
to
perceive
that
at
this
their
first
meeting
the
other
old
woman
was
endeavouring
to
turn
her
out
of
the
house
i
mean
that
it
can
hardly
be
necessary
to
call
upon
you
to
give
up
your
time
what
has
an
old
woman
to
do
with
her
time
mrs
morton
hitherto
morton
had
smiled
the
smile
indeed
had
been
grim
but
it
had
been
intended
to
betoken
outward
civility
now
there
came
a
frown
upon
her
brow
which
was
more
grim
and
by
no
means
civil
the
truth
is
that
at
such
a
time
one
who
is
almost
a
stranger
i
am
no
stranger
said
lady
ushant
you
had
not
seen
him
since
he
was
an
infant
my
name
was
morton
as
is
his
and
my
dear
father
was
the
owner
of
this
house
your
husband
morton
was
his
grandfather
and
my
brother
i
will
allow
no
one
to
tell
me
that
i
am
a
stranger
at
bragton
i
have
lived
here
many
more
years
than
you
a
stranger
to
him
i
meant
and
now
that
he
is
ill
i
shall
stay
with
him
till
he
desires
me
to
go
away
he
asked
me
to
stay
and
that
is
quite
enough
then
she
got
up
and
left
the
room
with
more
dignity
as
also
she
had
spoken
with
more
earnestness
than
morton
had
given
her
credit
for
possessing
after
that
the
two
ladies
did
not
meet
again
till
the
next
day
chapter
iv
the
two
old
ladies
on
the
next
morning
morton
did
not
come
down
to
breakfast
but
sat
alone
upstairs
nursing
her
wrath
during
the
night
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
one
or
two
things
she
would
never
enter
her
grandson
chambers
when
lady
ushant
was
there
she
would
not
speak
to
reginald
morton
and
should
he
come
into
her
presence
while
she
was
at
bragton
she
would
leave
the
room
she
would
do
her
best
to
make
the
house
in
common
parlance
too
hot
to
hold
that
other
woman
and
she
would
make
use
of
those
words
which
john
had
spoken
concerning
chowton
farm
as
a
peg
on
which
she
might
hang
her
discourse
in
reference
to
his
will
if
in
doing
all
this
she
should
receive
that
dutiful
assistance
which
she
thought
that
he
owed
her
then
she
should
stand
by
his
and
be
tender
to
him
and
nurse
him
to
the
last
as
a
mother
would
nurse
a
child
but
if
as
she
feared
he
were
headstrong
in
disobeying
then
she
would
remember
that
her
duty
to
her
family
if
done
with
a
firm
purpose
would
have
lasting
results
while
his
life
might
probably
be
an
affair
of
a
few
weeks
or
even
days
at
about
eleven
lady
ushant
was
with
her
patient
when
a
message
was
brought
by
hopkins
morton
wished
to
see
her
grandson
and
desired
to
know
whether
it
would
suit
him
that
she
should
come
now
why
not
said
the
sick
man
who
was
sitting
up
in
his
bed
then
lady
ushant
collected
her
knitting
and
was
about
to
depart
must
you
go
because
she
is
coming
morton
asked
lady
ushant
shocked
at
the
necessity
of
explaining
to
him
the
ill
feeling
that
existed
said
that
perhaps
it
would
be
best
why
should
it
be
best
lady
ushant
shook
her
head
and
smiled
and
put
her
hand
upon
the
counterpane
and
retired
as
she
passed
the
door
of
her
rival
room
she
could
see
the
black
silk
dress
moving
behind
the
partly
open
door
and
as
she
entered
her
own
she
heard
morton
steps
upon
the
corridor
the
place
was
already
almost
too
hot
for
her
anything
would
be
better
than
scenes
like
this
in
the
house
of
a
dying
man
need
my
aunt
have
gone
away
he
asked
after
the
first
greeting
i
did
not
say
so
she
seemed
to
think
that
she
was
not
to
stay
can
i
help
what
she
thinks
john
of
course
she
feels
that
she
is
is
what
an
interloper
if
i
must
say
it
but
i
have
sent
for
her
and
i
have
begged
her
to
stay
of
course
she
can
stay
if
she
wishes
but
dear
john
there
must
be
much
to
be
said
between
you
and
me
which
which
can
not
interest
her
or
which
at
least
she
ought
not
to
hear
he
did
not
contradict
this
in
words
feeling
himself
to
be
too
weak
for
contest
but
within
his
own
mind
he
declared
that
it
was
not
so
the
things
which
interested
him
now
were
as
likely
to
interest
his
as
his
grandmother
and
to
be
as
fit
for
the
ears
of
the
one
as
for
those
of
the
other
an
hour
had
passed
after
this
during
which
she
tended
him
giving
him
food
and
medicine
and
he
had
slept
before
she
ventured
to
allude
to
the
subject
which
was
nearest
to
her
heart
john
she
said
at
last
i
have
been
thinking
about
chowton
farm
well
it
certainly
should
be
bought
if
the
man
resolves
on
selling
it
of
course
i
mean
that
how
much
would
it
be
then
he
mentioned
the
sum
which
twentyman
had
named
saying
that
he
had
inquired
and
had
been
told
that
the
price
was
reasonable
it
is
a
large
sum
of
money
john
there
might
be
a
mortgage
for
part
of
it
i
do
like
mortgages
the
property
would
not
be
yours
at
all
if
it
were
mortgaged
as
soon
as
bought
you
would
pay
per
cent
for
the
money
and
only
get
per
cent
from
the
land
the
old
lady
understood
all
about
it
i
could
pay
it
off
in
two
years
said
the
sick
man
there
need
be
no
paying
off
and
no
mortgage
if
i
did
it
i
almost
believe
i
have
got
enough
to
do
it
he
knew
very
well
that
she
had
much
more
than
enough
i
think
more
of
this
property
than
of
anything
in
the
world
my
dear
chowton
farm
could
be
yours
you
know
what
should
i
do
with
chowton
farm
i
shall
probably
be
in
my
grave
before
the
slow
lawyer
would
have
executed
the
deeds
and
i
in
mine
thought
he
to
himself
before
the
present
owner
has
quite
made
up
his
mind
to
part
with
his
land
what
would
a
little
place
like
that
do
for
me
but
in
my
time
it
was
part
of
the
bragton
property
he
sold
it
to
pay
the
debts
of
a
younger
son
forgetting
as
i
thought
what
he
owed
to
the
estate
it
had
in
truth
been
sold
on
behalf
of
the
husband
of
this
old
woman
who
was
now
complaining
and
if
it
can
be
recovered
it
is
our
duty
to
get
it
back
again
a
property
like
this
should
never
be
lessened
it
is
in
that
way
that
the
country
is
given
over
to
shopkeepers
and
speculators
and
is
made
to
be
like
france
or
italy
i
quite
think
that
chowton
farm
should
be
bought
and
though
i
might
die
before
it
was
done
i
would
find
the
money
i
knew
what
your
feeling
would
be
yes
john
you
could
not
but
know
it
well
but
then
she
paused
a
moment
looking
into
his
face
but
i
should
wish
to
know
what
would
become
of
it
eventually
if
it
were
yours
you
could
do
what
you
pleased
with
it
but
it
would
be
yours
then
it
would
go
with
the
rest
of
the
property
to
whom
would
it
go
we
have
all
to
die
my
dear
and
who
can
say
whom
it
may
please
the
almighty
to
take
first
in
this
house
every
one
can
give
a
shrewd
guess
i
know
my
own
condition
if
i
die
without
children
of
my
own
every
acre
i
possess
will
go
to
the
proper
heir
thinking
as
you
do
you
ought
to
agree
with
me
in
that
but
who
is
the
proper
heir
my
cousin
reginald
do
not
let
us
contest
it
as
certainly
as
i
lie
here
he
will
have
bragton
when
i
am
gone
will
you
not
listen
to
me
john
not
about
that
how
could
i
die
in
peace
were
i
to
rob
him
it
is
all
your
own
to
do
as
you
like
with
it
is
all
my
own
but
not
to
do
as
i
like
with
with
your
feelings
with
your
ideas
how
can
you
urge
me
to
such
an
injustice
do
i
want
it
for
myself
i
do
not
even
want
it
for
any
one
belonging
to
me
there
is
your
cousin
peter
if
he
were
the
heir
he
should
have
it
though
i
know
nothing
of
him
and
believe
him
to
be
but
a
poor
creature
and
very
unfit
to
have
the
custody
of
a
family
property
but
he
is
his
father
son
i
will
believe
nothing
of
that
said
the
sick
man
raising
himself
in
his
bed
it
is
a
slander
it
is
based
on
no
evidence
whatsoever
no
one
even
thought
of
it
but
you
john
is
that
the
way
to
speak
to
me
it
is
the
way
to
speak
of
an
assertion
so
injurious
then
he
fell
back
again
on
his
pillows
and
she
sat
by
his
bedside
for
a
full
half
hour
speechless
thinking
of
it
all
at
the
end
of
that
time
she
had
resolved
that
she
would
not
yet
give
it
up
should
he
regain
his
health
and
strength
and
she
would
pray
fervently
night
and
day
that
god
would
be
so
good
to
him
then
everything
would
be
well
then
he
would
marry
and
have
children
and
bragton
would
descend
in
the
right
line
but
were
it
to
be
ordained
otherwise
should
it
be
god
will
that
he
must
die
then
as
he
grew
weaker
he
would
become
more
plastic
in
her
hands
and
she
might
still
prevail
at
present
he
was
stubborn
with
the
old
stubbornness
and
would
not
see
with
her
eyes
she
would
bide
her
time
and
be
careful
to
have
a
lawyer
ready
she
turned
it
all
over
in
her
mind
as
she
sat
there
watching
him
in
his
sleep
she
knew
of
no
one
but
masters
whom
she
distrusted
as
being
connected
with
the
other
side
of
the
family
whose
father
had
made
that
will
by
which
the
property
in
dillsborough
had
been
dissevered
from
bragton
but
masters
would
probably
obey
instructions
if
they
were
given
to
him
definitely
she
thought
of
it
all
and
then
went
down
to
lunch
she
did
not
dare
to
refuse
altogether
to
meet
the
other
woman
lest
such
resolve
on
her
part
might
teach
those
in
the
house
to
think
that
lady
ushant
was
the
mistress
she
took
her
place
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
interchanged
a
few
words
with
her
grandson
guest
which
of
course
had
reference
to
his
health
lady
ushant
was
very
ill
able
to
carry
on
a
battle
of
any
sort
and
was
willing
to
show
her
submission
in
everything
unless
she
were
desired
to
leave
the
house
while
they
were
still
sitting
at
table
reginald
morton
walked
into
the
room
it
had
been
his
habit
to
do
so
regularly
for
the
last
week
a
daily
visitor
does
not
wait
to
have
himself
announced
reginald
had
considered
the
matter
and
had
determined
that
he
would
follow
his
practice
just
as
though
morton
were
not
there
if
she
were
civil
to
him
then
would
he
be
very
courteous
to
her
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
to
expect
conduct
such
as
that
with
which
she
greeted
him
the
old
woman
got
up
and
looked
at
him
sternly
my
nephew
reginald
said
lady
ushant
supposing
that
some
introduction
might
be
necessary
morton
gathered
the
folds
of
her
dress
together
and
without
a
word
stalked
out
of
the
room
and
yet
she
believed
she
could
not
but
believe
that
her
grandson
was
on
his
deathbed
in
the
room
above
o
reginald
what
are
we
to
do
said
lady
ushant
is
she
like
that
to
you
she
told
me
last
night
that
i
was
a
stranger
and
that
i
ought
to
leave
the
house
and
what
did
you
say
i
told
her
i
should
stay
while
he
wished
me
to
stay
but
it
is
all
so
terrible
that
i
think
i
had
better
go
i
would
not
stir
a
step
on
her
account
but
why
should
she
be
so
bitter
i
have
done
nothing
to
offend
her
it
is
more
than
half
of
even
my
long
lifetime
since
i
saw
her
she
is
nothing
but
i
have
to
think
of
his
comfort
i
suppose
she
is
good
to
him
and
though
he
may
bid
me
stay
such
scenes
as
this
in
the
house
must
be
a
trouble
to
him
nevertheless
reginald
was
strong
in
opinion
that
lady
ushant
ought
not
to
allow
herself
to
be
driven
away
and
declared
his
own
purpose
of
coming
daily
as
had
of
late
been
his
wont
soon
after
this
reginald
was
summoned
to
go
upstairs
and
he
again
met
the
angry
woman
in
the
passage
passing
her
of
course
without
a
word
and
then
mary
came
to
see
her
friend
and
she
also
encountered
morton
who
was
determined
that
no
one
should
come
into
that
house
without
her
knowledge
who
is
that
young
woman
said
morton
to
the
old
housekeeper
that
is
miss
masters
my
lady
and
who
is
miss
masters
and
why
does
she
come
here
at
such
a
time
as
this
she
is
the
daughter
of
attorney
masters
my
lady
it
was
she
as
was
brought
up
here
by
lady
ushant
oh
that
young
person
she
come
here
generally
of
a
day
now
to
see
her
ladyship
and
is
she
taken
up
to
my
grandson
oh
dear
no
my
lady
she
sits
with
lady
ushant
for
an
hour
or
so
and
then
goes
back
with
mr
reginald
oh
that
is
it
is
it
the
house
is
made
use
of
for
such
purposes
as
that
i
do
think
there
is
any
purposes
my
lady
said
hopkins
almost
roused
to
indignation
although
she
was
talking
to
the
acknowledged
mistress
of
the
house
whom
she
always
called
my
lady
lady
ushant
told
the
whole
story
to
her
young
friend
bitterly
bewailing
her
position
reginald
tells
me
not
to
go
but
i
do
not
think
that
i
can
stand
it
i
should
not
mind
the
quarrel
so
much
only
that
he
is
so
she
must
be
a
very
person
she
was
always
arrogant
and
always
hard
i
can
remember
her
just
the
same
but
that
was
so
many
years
ago
she
left
bragton
then
because
she
could
not
banish
his
mother
from
the
house
but
to
bear
it
all
in
her
heart
so
long
is
not
like
a
human
being
let
alone
a
woman
what
did
he
say
to
you
going
home
yesterday
nothing
lady
ushant
does
he
know
that
it
will
all
be
his
if
that
poor
young
man
should
die
he
never
speaks
to
me
as
if
he
thought
of
it
he
would
certainly
not
speak
to
me
about
it
i
do
not
think
he
thinks
of
it
he
is
not
like
that
men
do
consider
such
things
and
they
are
only
cousins
and
they
have
never
known
each
other
oh
mary
what
are
you
thinking
of
lady
ushant
men
ought
not
to
care
for
money
or
position
but
they
do
if
he
comes
here
all
that
i
have
will
be
yours
oh
lady
ushant
it
is
not
much
but
it
will
be
enough
i
do
not
want
to
hear
about
such
things
now
but
you
ought
to
be
told
ah
dear
if
it
could
be
as
i
wish
the
imprudent
loving
old
woman
longed
to
hear
a
tale
of
mutual
love
longed
to
do
something
which
should
cause
such
a
tale
to
be
true
on
both
sides
and
yet
she
could
not
quite
bring
herself
to
express
her
wish
either
to
the
man
or
to
the
woman
poor
mary
almost
understood
it
but
was
not
quite
sure
of
her
friend
meaning
she
was
however
quite
sure
that
if
such
were
the
wish
of
lady
ushant
heart
lady
ushant
was
wishing
in
vain
she
had
twice
walked
back
to
dillsborough
with
reginald
morton
and
he
had
been
more
sedate
more
less
like
a
lover
than
ever
she
knew
now
that
she
might
safely
walk
with
him
being
sure
that
he
was
no
more
likely
to
talk
of
love
than
would
have
been
old
nupper
had
she
accepted
the
offer
which
he
had
made
her
of
a
cast
in
his
gig
and
now
that
reginald
would
probably
become
squire
of
bragton
it
was
more
impossible
than
ever
as
squire
of
bragton
he
would
seek
some
highly
born
bride
quite
out
of
her
way
whom
she
could
never
know
and
then
she
would
see
neither
him
nor
bragton
any
more
would
it
not
have
been
better
that
she
should
have
married
larry
twentyman
and
put
an
end
to
so
many
troubles
beside
her
own
again
she
walked
back
with
him
to
dillsborough
passing
as
they
always
did
across
the
little
bridge
he
seemed
to
be
very
silent
as
he
went
more
so
than
usual
and
as
was
her
wont
with
him
she
only
spoke
to
him
when
he
addressed
her
it
was
only
when
he
got
out
on
the
road
that
he
told
her
what
was
on
his
mind
mary
he
said
how
will
it
be
with
me
if
that
poor
fellow
dies
in
what
way
mr
morton
all
that
place
will
be
mine
he
told
me
so
just
now
but
that
would
be
of
course
not
at
all
he
might
give
it
to
you
if
he
pleased
he
could
not
have
an
heir
who
would
care
for
it
less
but
it
is
right
that
it
should
be
so
whether
it
would
suit
my
taste
or
not
to
live
as
squire
of
bragton
and
i
do
not
think
it
would
suit
my
taste
well
it
ought
to
be
so
i
am
the
next
and
it
will
be
my
duty
i
am
sure
you
do
not
want
him
to
die
no
indeed
if
i
could
save
him
by
my
right
hand
if
i
could
save
him
by
my
life
i
would
do
it
but
of
all
lives
it
must
surely
be
the
best
do
you
think
so
what
is
such
a
one
likely
to
do
but
then
what
do
i
do
as
it
is
it
is
the
sort
of
life
you
would
like
if
you
were
a
man
yes
if
i
were
a
man
said
mary
then
he
again
relapsed
into
silence
and
hardly
spoke
again
till
he
left
her
at
her
father
door
chapter
the
last
effort
when
mary
reached
her
home
she
was
at
once
met
by
her
stepmother
in
the
passage
with
tidings
of
importance
he
is
in
the
said
masters
mary
whose
mind
was
laden
with
thoughts
of
reginald
morton
asked
who
was
the
he
lawrence
twentyman
said
masters
and
now
my
dear
do
do
think
of
it
before
you
go
to
him
there
was
no
anger
now
in
her
face
but
entreaty
and
almost
love
she
had
not
called
mary
my
dear
for
many
weeks
past
not
since
that
journey
to
cheltenham
now
she
grasped
the
girl
hand
as
she
went
on
with
her
prayer
he
is
so
good
and
so
true
and
what
better
can
there
be
for
you
with
your
advantages
and
lady
ushant
and
all
that
you
would
be
quite
the
lady
at
chowton
think
of
your
father
and
sisters
what
a
good
you
could
do
them
and
think
of
the
respect
they
all
have
for
him
dining
with
lord
rufford
the
other
day
and
all
the
other
gentlemen
it
only
that
he
has
got
plenty
to
live
on
but
he
knows
how
to
keep
it
as
a
man
ought
he
sure
to
hold
up
his
head
and
be
as
good
a
squire
as
any
of
this
was
a
very
different
tale
a
note
altogether
changed
it
must
not
be
said
that
the
difference
of
the
tale
and
the
change
of
the
note
affected
mary
heart
but
her
manner
to
her
did
soften
her
and
then
why
should
she
regard
herself
or
her
own
feelings
like
others
she
had
thought
much
of
her
own
happiness
had
made
herself
the
centre
of
her
own
circle
had
in
her
imagination
built
castles
in
the
air
and
filled
them
according
to
her
fancy
but
her
fancies
had
been
all
shattered
into
fragments
not
a
stone
of
her
castles
was
standing
she
had
told
herself
unconsciously
that
there
was
no
longer
a
circle
and
no
need
for
a
centre
that
last
which
she
had
passed
with
reginald
morton
on
the
road
home
had
made
quite
sure
that
which
had
been
sure
enough
before
he
was
now
altogether
out
of
her
reach
thinking
only
of
the
new
duties
which
were
coming
to
him
she
would
never
walk
with
him
again
never
put
herself
in
the
way
of
indulging
some
fragment
of
an
illusory
hope
she
was
nothing
now
nothing
even
to
herself
why
should
she
not
give
herself
and
her
services
to
this
young
man
if
the
young
man
chose
to
take
her
as
she
was
it
would
be
well
that
she
should
do
something
in
the
world
why
should
she
not
look
after
his
house
and
mend
his
shirts
and
reign
over
his
poultry
yard
in
this
way
she
would
be
useful
and
respected
by
all
unless
perhaps
by
the
man
she
loved
mary
say
that
you
will
think
of
it
once
more
pleaded
masters
i
may
go
to
my
own
room
certainly
do
go
up
and
smooth
your
hair
i
will
tell
him
that
you
are
coming
to
him
he
will
wait
but
he
is
so
much
in
earnest
now
and
so
sad
that
i
know
he
will
not
come
again
then
mary
went
determined
to
think
of
it
she
began
at
once
to
smooth
her
hair
as
her
stepmother
had
recommended
and
to
remove
the
dust
of
the
road
from
her
face
and
dress
but
not
the
less
was
she
thinking
of
it
the
while
could
she
do
it
how
much
pain
would
be
spared
even
to
herself
how
much
that
was
now
bitter
as
gall
in
her
mouth
would
become
not
sweet
but
tasteless
there
are
times
in
one
life
in
which
the
absence
of
all
savour
seems
to
be
sufficient
for
life
in
this
world
were
she
to
do
this
thing
she
thought
that
she
would
have
strength
to
banish
that
other
man
from
her
mind
and
at
last
from
her
heart
he
would
be
there
close
to
her
but
of
a
different
kind
and
leading
a
different
life
masters
had
told
her
that
larry
would
be
as
good
a
squire
as
the
best
of
them
but
it
should
be
her
care
to
keep
him
and
herself
in
their
proper
position
to
teach
him
the
vanity
of
such
aspirations
and
the
real
squire
opposite
who
would
despise
her
for
had
he
not
told
her
that
she
would
be
despicable
if
she
married
this
man
would
not
trouble
her
then
they
might
meet
on
the
roads
and
there
would
be
a
cold
question
or
two
as
to
each
welfare
and
a
vain
shaking
of
hands
but
they
would
know
nothing
and
care
for
nothing
as
to
each
other
thoughts
and
there
would
come
some
stately
dame
who
hearing
how
things
had
been
many
years
ago
would
perhaps
but
no
the
stately
dame
should
be
received
with
courtesy
but
there
should
be
no
patronising
even
in
these
few
minutes
she
thought
much
of
the
stately
dame
and
was
quite
sure
that
she
would
endure
no
patronage
from
bragton
she
almost
thought
that
she
could
do
it
there
were
hideous
ideas
afflicting
her
soul
dreadfully
but
which
she
strove
to
banish
of
course
she
could
not
love
him
not
at
first
but
all
those
who
wished
her
to
marry
him
including
himself
knew
that
and
still
they
wished
her
to
marry
him
how
could
that
be
disgraceful
which
all
her
friends
desired
her
father
to
whom
she
was
as
she
knew
well
the
very
apple
of
his
eye
wished
her
to
marry
this
man
and
yet
her
father
knew
that
her
heart
was
elsewhere
had
not
women
done
it
by
hundreds
by
thousands
and
had
afterwards
performed
their
duties
well
as
mothers
and
wives
in
other
countries
as
she
had
read
girls
took
the
husbands
found
for
them
by
their
parents
as
a
matter
of
course
as
she
left
the
room
and
slowly
crept
she
almost
thought
she
would
do
it
she
almost
thought
but
yet
when
her
hand
was
on
the
lock
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
say
that
it
should
be
so
he
was
not
dressed
as
usual
in
the
first
place
there
was
a
round
hat
on
the
table
such
as
men
wear
in
cities
she
had
never
before
seen
such
a
hat
with
him
except
on
a
sunday
and
he
wore
a
black
cloth
coat
and
dark
brown
pantaloons
and
a
black
silk
handkerchief
she
observed
it
all
and
thought
that
he
had
not
changed
for
the
better
as
she
looked
into
his
face
it
seemed
to
her
more
common
meaner
than
before
no
doubt
he
was
but
his
were
almost
repulsive
to
her
he
had
altogether
lost
his
little
swagger
but
he
had
borne
that
little
swagger
well
and
in
her
presence
it
had
never
been
offensive
now
he
seemed
as
though
he
had
thrown
aside
all
the
old
habits
of
his
life
and
was
pining
to
death
from
the
loss
of
them
mary
he
said
i
have
come
to
you
for
the
last
time
i
thought
i
would
give
myself
one
more
chance
and
your
father
told
me
that
i
might
have
it
he
paused
as
though
expecting
an
answer
but
she
had
not
yet
quite
made
up
her
mind
had
she
known
her
mind
she
would
have
answered
him
frankly
she
was
quite
resolved
as
to
that
if
she
could
once
bring
herself
to
give
him
her
hand
she
would
not
coy
it
for
a
moment
i
will
be
your
wife
larry
that
was
the
form
on
which
she
had
determined
should
she
find
herself
able
to
yield
but
she
had
not
brought
herself
to
it
as
yet
if
you
can
take
me
mary
you
will
well
save
me
from
lifelong
misery
and
make
the
man
who
loves
you
the
and
the
happiest
man
in
england
but
larry
i
do
not
love
you
i
will
make
you
love
me
good
usage
will
make
a
wife
love
her
husband
do
you
think
you
can
trust
me
i
do
believe
that
i
can
trust
you
for
everything
good
is
that
nothing
it
is
a
great
deal
larry
but
not
enough
not
enough
to
bring
together
a
man
and
woman
as
husband
and
wife
i
would
sooner
marry
a
man
i
loved
though
i
knew
he
would
me
would
you
to
marry
either
would
be
wrong
i
sometimes
think
dearest
that
if
i
could
talk
better
i
should
be
better
able
to
persuade
you
i
sometimes
think
you
talk
so
well
that
i
ought
to
be
persuaded
but
i
ca
it
is
not
lack
of
talking
what
is
it
then
just
this
my
heart
does
not
turn
itself
that
way
it
is
the
same
chance
that
has
made
you
partial
to
me
partial
why
i
love
the
very
air
you
breathe
when
i
am
near
you
everything
smells
sweet
there
is
anything
that
belongs
to
you
but
i
think
i
should
know
it
though
i
found
it
a
hundred
miles
away
to
have
you
in
the
room
with
me
would
be
like
heaven
if
i
only
knew
that
you
were
thinking
kindly
of
me
i
always
think
kindly
of
you
larry
then
say
that
you
will
be
my
wife
she
paused
and
became
red
up
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
she
seated
herself
on
a
chair
and
then
rose
again
and
again
sat
down
the
struggle
was
going
on
within
her
and
he
perceived
something
of
the
truth
say
the
word
once
mary
say
it
but
once
and
as
he
prayed
to
her
he
came
forward
and
went
down
upon
his
knees
i
can
not
do
it
she
replied
at
last
speaking
very
hoarsely
not
looking
at
him
not
even
addressing
herself
to
him
mary
larry
i
can
not
do
it
i
have
tried
but
i
can
not
do
it
o
larry
dear
larry
do
not
ask
me
again
larry
i
have
no
heart
to
give
another
man
has
it
all
is
it
so
she
bowed
her
head
in
token
of
assent
is
it
that
young
parson
exclaimed
larry
in
anger
it
is
not
but
larry
you
must
ask
no
questions
now
i
have
told
you
my
secret
that
all
this
might
be
set
at
rest
but
if
you
are
generous
as
i
know
you
are
you
will
keep
my
secret
and
will
ask
no
questions
and
larry
if
you
are
unhappy
so
am
i
if
your
heart
is
sore
so
is
mine
he
knows
nothing
of
my
love
and
cares
nothing
for
me
then
throw
him
aside
she
smiled
and
shook
her
head
do
you
think
i
would
not
if
i
could
why
do
you
not
throw
me
aside
oh
mary
can
not
i
love
as
well
as
you
you
are
a
man
and
have
the
liberty
to
speak
of
it
though
i
can
not
return
it
i
can
be
proud
of
your
love
and
feel
grateful
to
you
i
can
not
tell
mine
i
can
not
think
of
it
without
blushing
but
i
can
feel
it
and
know
it
and
be
as
sure
that
it
has
trodden
me
down
and
got
the
better
of
me
as
you
can
but
you
can
go
out
into
the
world
and
teach
yourself
to
forget
i
must
go
away
from
here
then
you
have
your
business
and
your
pleasures
your
horses
and
your
fields
and
your
friends
i
have
nothing
but
to
remain
here
and
know
that
i
have
disobliged
all
those
that
love
me
do
you
think
larry
i
would
not
go
and
be
your
wife
if
i
could
i
have
told
you
all
larry
and
now
do
not
ask
me
again
is
it
so
yes
it
is
so
then
i
shall
cut
it
all
i
shall
sell
chowton
and
go
away
you
tell
me
i
have
my
horses
and
my
pleasures
what
pleasures
i
know
nothing
of
my
horses
not
whether
they
are
lame
or
sound
i
could
not
tell
you
of
one
of
them
whether
he
is
fit
to
go
business
the
place
may
farm
itself
for
me
for
i
ca
stay
there
everything
sickens
me
to
look
at
it
pleasures
indeed
is
that
manly
larry
how
can
a
man
be
manly
when
the
manliness
is
knocked
out
of
him
a
man
courage
lies
in
his
heart
but
if
his
heart
is
broken
where
will
his
courage
be
then
i
could
hold
my
head
up
here
any
more
and
i
shall
go
you
must
not
do
that
she
said
getting
up
and
laying
hold
of
his
arm
but
i
must
do
it
for
my
sake
you
must
stay
here
larry
so
that
i
may
not
have
to
think
that
i
have
injured
you
so
deeply
larry
though
i
can
not
be
your
wife
i
think
i
could
die
of
sorrow
if
you
were
always
unhappy
what
is
a
poor
girl
that
you
should
grieve
for
her
in
that
way
i
think
if
i
were
a
man
i
would
master
my
love
better
than
that
he
shook
his
head
and
faintly
strove
to
drag
his
arm
from
out
of
her
grasp
promise
me
that
you
will
take
a
year
to
think
of
it
before
you
go
will
you
take
a
year
to
think
of
me
said
he
rising
again
to
sudden
hope
no
larry
no
i
should
deceive
you
were
i
to
say
so
i
deceived
you
before
when
i
put
it
off
for
two
months
but
you
can
promise
me
without
deceit
for
my
sake
larry
and
she
almost
embraced
him
as
she
begged
for
his
promise
i
know
you
would
wish
to
spare
me
pain
think
what
will
be
my
sufferings
if
i
hear
that
you
have
really
gone
from
chowton
you
will
promise
me
larry
promise
what
that
the
farm
shall
not
be
sold
for
twelve
months
oh
yes
i
promise
i
do
care
for
the
farm
and
stay
there
if
you
can
do
leave
the
place
to
strangers
and
go
about
your
business
and
hunt
and
be
a
man
i
shall
always
be
thinking
of
what
you
do
i
shall
always
watch
you
i
shall
always
love
you
always
always
always
i
always
have
loved
you
because
you
are
so
good
but
it
is
a
different
love
and
now
larry
so
saying
she
raised
her
face
to
look
into
his
eyes
then
he
suddenly
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
kissed
her
forehead
and
left
the
room
without
another
word
masters
saw
him
as
he
went
and
must
have
known
from
his
gait
what
was
the
nature
of
the
answer
he
had
received
but
yet
she
went
quickly
upstairs
to
inquire
the
matter
was
one
of
too
much
consequence
for
a
mere
inference
mary
had
gone
from
the
but
her
stepmother
followed
her
upstairs
to
her
mamma
she
said
i
could
do
it
i
could
do
it
i
did
try
pray
do
not
scold
me
i
did
try
but
i
could
not
do
it
then
she
threw
herself
into
the
arms
of
the
unsympathetic
woman
who
however
was
now
somewhat
less
unsympathetic
than
she
had
hitherto
been
masters
did
not
understand
it
at
all
but
she
did
perceive
that
there
was
something
which
she
did
not
understand
what
did
the
girl
mean
by
saying
that
she
had
tried
and
could
not
do
it
try
to
do
it
if
she
tried
why
could
she
not
tell
the
man
that
she
would
have
him
there
was
surely
some
shamefacedness
in
this
some
overstrained
modesty
which
she
masters
could
not
comprehend
how
could
she
have
tried
to
accept
a
man
who
was
so
anxious
to
marry
her
and
have
failed
in
the
effort
scolding
i
suppose
will
be
no
good
now
she
said
oh
no
but
well
i
suppose
we
must
put
up
with
it
everything
on
earth
that
a
girl
could
possibly
wish
for
he
was
that
in
love
that
it
my
belief
he
have
settled
it
all
on
you
if
you
only
asked
him
let
it
go
mamma
let
it
go
it
gone
i
suppose
well
i
ai
going
to
say
any
more
about
it
but
as
for
not
sorrowing
how
is
a
woman
not
to
sorrow
when
so
much
has
been
lost
it
your
poor
father
i
thinking
of
mary
this
was
so
much
better
than
she
had
expected
that
poor
mary
almost
felt
that
her
heart
was
lightened
chapter
vi
again
at
mistletoe
the
reader
will
have
been
aware
that
arabella
trefoil
was
not
a
favourite
at
mistletoe
she
was
so
much
disliked
by
the
duchess
that
there
had
almost
been
words
about
her
between
her
grace
and
the
duke
since
her
departure
the
duchess
always
submitted
and
it
was
the
rule
of
her
life
to
submit
with
so
good
a
grace
that
her
husband
never
fearing
rebellion
should
never
be
driven
to
assume
the
tyrant
but
on
this
occasion
the
duke
had
objected
to
the
term
thoroughly
bad
girl
which
had
been
applied
by
his
wife
to
his
niece
he
had
said
that
thoroughly
bad
girl
was
strong
language
and
when
the
duchess
defended
the
phrase
he
had
expressed
his
opinion
that
arabella
was
only
a
bad
girl
and
not
a
thoroughly
bad
girl
the
duchess
had
said
that
it
was
the
same
thing
then
said
the
duke
why
use
a
redundant
expletive
against
your
own
relative
the
duchess
when
she
was
accused
of
strong
language
had
not
minded
it
much
but
her
feelings
were
hurt
when
a
redundant
expletive
was
attributed
to
her
the
effect
of
all
this
had
been
that
the
duke
in
a
mild
way
had
taken
up
arabella
part
and
that
the
duchess
following
her
husband
at
last
had
been
brought
round
to
own
that
arabella
though
bad
had
been
badly
treated
she
had
disbelieved
and
then
believed
and
had
again
disbelieved
arabella
own
statement
as
to
the
offer
of
marriage
but
the
girl
had
certainly
been
in
earnest
when
she
had
begged
her
aunt
to
ask
her
uncle
to
speak
to
lord
rufford
surely
when
she
did
she
must
have
thought
that
an
offer
had
been
made
to
her
such
offer
if
made
had
no
doubt
been
produced
by
very
hard
pressure
but
still
an
offer
of
marriage
is
an
offer
and
a
girl
if
she
can
obtain
it
has
a
right
to
use
such
an
offer
as
so
much
property
then
came
lord
mistletoe
report
after
his
meeting
with
arabella
up
in
london
he
had
been
unable
to
give
his
cousin
any
satisfaction
but
he
was
clearly
of
opinion
that
she
had
been
he
did
not
venture
to
suggest
any
steps
but
did
think
that
lord
rufford
was
bound
as
a
gentleman
to
marry
the
young
lady
after
that
lord
augustus
saw
her
mother
up
in
town
and
said
that
it
was
a
d
shame
he
in
truth
had
believed
nothing
and
would
have
been
delighted
to
allow
the
matter
to
drop
but
as
this
was
not
permitted
he
thought
it
easier
to
take
his
daughter
part
than
to
encounter
family
enmity
by
entering
the
lists
against
her
so
it
came
to
pass
that
down
at
mistletoe
there
grew
an
opinion
that
lord
rufford
ought
to
marry
arabella
trefoil
but
what
should
be
done
the
duke
was
alive
to
the
feeling
that
as
the
girl
was
certainly
his
niece
and
as
she
was
not
to
be
regarded
as
a
thoroughly
bad
girl
some
assistance
was
due
to
her
from
the
family
lord
mistletoe
volunteered
to
write
to
lord
rufford
lord
augustus
thought
that
his
brother
should
have
a
personal
interview
with
his
young
brother
peer
and
bring
his
strawberry
leaves
to
bear
the
duke
himself
suggested
that
the
duchess
should
see
lady
penwether
a
scheme
to
which
her
grace
objected
strongly
knowing
something
of
lady
penwether
and
being
sure
that
her
strawberry
leaves
would
have
no
effect
whatever
on
the
baronet
wife
at
last
it
was
decided
that
a
family
meeting
should
be
held
and
lord
augustus
was
absolutely
summoned
to
meet
lord
mistletoe
at
the
paternal
mansion
it
was
now
some
years
since
lord
augustus
had
been
at
mistletoe
as
he
had
never
been
separated
that
is
formally
separated
from
his
wife
he
and
she
had
been
always
invited
there
together
year
after
year
she
had
accepted
the
invitation
and
it
had
been
declined
on
his
behalf
because
it
did
not
suit
him
and
his
wife
to
meet
each
other
but
now
he
was
obliged
to
go
there
just
at
the
time
of
the
year
when
whist
at
his
club
was
most
attractive
to
meet
the
convenience
of
lord
mistletoe
and
the
house
of
commons
a
saturday
afternoon
was
named
for
the
conference
which
made
it
worse
for
lord
augustus
as
he
was
one
of
a
little
party
which
had
private
gatherings
for
whist
on
sunday
afternoons
but
he
went
to
the
conference
travelling
down
by
the
same
train
with
his
nephew
but
not
in
the
same
compartment
as
he
solaced
with
tobacco
the
time
which
lord
mistletoe
devoted
to
parliamentary
erudition
the
four
met
in
her
grace
boudoir
and
the
duke
began
by
declaring
that
all
this
was
very
sad
lord
augustus
shook
his
head
and
put
his
hands
in
his
trousers
pockets
which
was
as
much
as
to
say
that
his
feelings
as
a
british
parent
were
almost
too
strong
for
him
your
mother
and
i
think
that
something
ought
to
be
done
said
the
duke
turning
to
his
son
something
ought
to
be
done
said
lord
mistletoe
they
wo
let
a
fellow
go
out
with
a
fellow
now
said
lord
augustus
heaven
forbid
said
the
duchess
raising
both
her
hands
i
was
thinking
mistletoe
that
your
mother
might
have
met
lady
penwether
what
could
i
do
with
lady
penwether
duke
or
what
could
she
do
with
him
a
man
wo
care
for
what
his
sister
says
to
him
and
i
suppose
she
undertake
to
speak
to
lord
rufford
on
the
subject
lady
penwether
is
an
honourable
and
an
accomplished
woman
i
dare
say
though
she
gives
herself
abominable
airs
of
course
if
you
do
like
it
my
dear
it
sha
be
pressed
i
thought
perhaps
you
see
him
yourself
said
lord
augustus
turning
to
his
brother
you
carry
more
weight
than
anybody
of
course
i
will
if
it
be
necessary
but
it
would
be
disagreeable
very
disagreeable
the
appeal
should
be
made
to
his
feelings
and
that
i
think
would
better
come
through
female
influence
as
far
as
i
know
the
world
a
man
is
always
more
prone
to
be
led
in
such
matters
by
a
woman
than
by
another
man
if
you
mean
me
said
the
duchess
i
do
think
i
could
see
him
of
course
augustus
i
do
wish
to
say
anything
hard
of
arabella
the
fact
that
we
have
all
met
here
to
take
her
part
will
prove
that
i
think
but
i
did
quite
approve
of
all
that
was
done
here
lord
augustus
stroked
his
beard
and
looked
out
of
the
window
i
do
think
my
dear
we
need
go
into
that
just
now
said
the
duke
not
at
all
said
the
duchess
and
i
do
intend
to
say
a
word
only
if
i
were
to
meet
lord
rufford
he
might
refer
to
things
which
which
which
in
point
of
fact
i
had
rather
not
i
might
see
him
suggested
lord
mistletoe
no
doubt
that
might
be
done
with
advantage
said
the
duke
only
that
as
he
is
my
senior
in
age
what
i
might
say
to
him
would
lack
that
weight
which
any
observations
which
might
be
made
on
such
a
matter
should
carry
with
them
he
did
care
a
straw
for
me
said
lord
augustus
and
then
continued
lord
mistletoe
i
so
completely
agree
with
what
my
father
says
as
to
the
advantage
of
female
influence
with
a
man
of
lord
rufford
temperament
female
influence
is
everything
if
my
aunt
were
to
try
it
lord
augustus
blew
the
breath
out
of
his
mouth
and
raised
his
eyebrows
knowing
what
he
did
of
his
wife
or
thinking
that
he
knew
what
he
did
he
did
not
conceive
it
possible
that
a
worse
messenger
should
be
chosen
he
had
known
himself
to
be
a
very
bad
one
but
he
did
honestly
believe
her
to
be
even
less
fitted
for
the
task
than
he
himself
but
he
said
nothing
simply
wishing
that
he
had
not
left
his
whist
for
such
a
purpose
as
this
perhaps
lady
augustus
had
better
see
him
said
the
duke
the
duchess
who
did
not
love
hypocrisy
would
not
actually
assent
to
this
but
she
said
nothing
i
suppose
my
would
not
object
augustus
g
almighty
only
knows
said
the
younger
brother
the
duchess
grievously
offended
by
the
impropriety
of
this
language
drew
herself
up
haughtily
perhaps
you
would
not
mind
suggesting
it
to
her
sir
said
lord
mistletoe
i
could
do
that
by
letter
said
the
duke
and
when
she
has
assented
as
of
course
she
will
then
perhaps
you
would
mind
writing
a
line
to
him
to
make
an
appointment
if
you
were
to
do
so
he
could
not
refuse
to
this
proposition
the
duke
returned
no
immediate
answer
but
looked
at
it
round
and
round
carefully
at
last
however
he
acceded
to
this
also
and
so
the
matter
was
arranged
all
these
influential
members
of
the
ducal
family
met
together
at
the
ducal
mansion
on
arabella
behalf
and
settled
their
difficulty
by
deputing
the
work
of
bearding
the
lion
of
tying
the
bell
on
the
cat
to
an
absent
lady
whom
they
all
despised
and
disliked
that
afternoon
the
duke
with
the
assistance
of
his
son
who
was
a
great
writer
of
letters
prepared
an
epistle
to
his
and
another
to
lord
rufford
which
was
to
be
sent
as
soon
as
lady
augusta
had
agreed
to
the
arrangement
in
the
former
letter
a
good
deal
was
said
as
to
a
mother
solicitude
for
her
daughter
it
had
been
felt
the
letter
said
that
no
one
could
speak
for
a
daughter
so
well
as
a
mother
that
no
other
words
would
so
surely
reach
the
heart
of
a
man
who
was
not
all
evil
but
who
was
tempted
by
the
surroundings
of
the
world
to
do
evil
in
this
particular
case
the
letter
began
my
dear
and
ended
your
affectionate
mayfair
and
was
in
fact
the
first
letter
that
the
duke
had
ever
written
to
his
brother
wife
the
other
letter
was
more
difficult
but
it
was
accomplished
at
last
and
confined
itself
to
a
request
that
lord
rufford
would
meet
lady
augustus
trefoil
at
a
place
and
at
a
time
both
of
which
were
for
the
present
left
blank
on
the
monday
lord
augustus
and
lord
mistletoe
were
driven
to
the
station
in
the
same
carriage
and
on
this
occasion
the
uncle
said
a
few
strong
words
to
his
nephew
on
the
subject
lord
augustus
though
perhaps
a
coward
in
the
presence
of
his
brother
was
not
so
with
other
members
of
the
family
it
may
be
very
well
you
know
but
all
d
nonsense
i
sorry
that
you
should
think
so
uncle
what
do
you
suppose
her
mother
can
do
a
thoroughly
vulgar
woman
i
never
could
live
with
her
as
far
as
i
can
see
wherever
she
goes
everybody
hates
her
my
dear
uncle
rufford
will
only
laugh
at
her
if
mayfair
would
have
gone
himself
it
is
just
possible
that
he
might
have
done
something
my
father
is
so
unwilling
to
mix
himself
up
in
these
things
of
course
he
is
everybody
knows
that
what
the
deuce
was
the
good
then
of
our
going
down
there
i
could
do
anything
and
i
knew
he
would
the
truth
is
mistletoe
a
man
may
do
just
what
he
pleases
you
ai
in
that
line
and
it
wo
do
you
any
good
knowing
it
but
since
we
did
away
with
pistols
everybody
may
do
just
what
he
likes
i
do
like
brute
force
said
lord
mistletoe
you
may
call
it
what
you
please
but
i
do
know
that
it
was
so
brutal
after
all
at
the
station
they
separated
again
as
lord
augustus
was
panting
for
tobacco
and
lord
mistletoe
for
parliamentary
erudition
chapter
vii
the
success
of
lady
augustus
lady
augustus
was
still
staying
with
the
connop
greens
in
hampshire
when
she
received
the
duke
letter
and
arabella
was
with
her
the
story
of
lord
rufford
infidelity
had
been
told
to
connop
green
and
of
course
through
her
to
connop
green
both
the
mother
and
daughter
affected
to
despise
the
connop
greens
but
it
is
so
hard
to
restrain
oneself
from
confidences
when
difficulties
arise
arabella
had
by
this
time
quite
persuaded
herself
that
there
had
been
an
absolute
engagement
and
did
in
truth
believe
that
she
had
been
most
cruelly
she
was
headstrong
fickle
and
beyond
measure
insolent
to
her
mother
she
had
as
we
know
at
one
time
gone
down
to
the
house
of
her
former
lover
thereby
indicating
that
she
had
abandoned
all
hope
of
catching
lord
rufford
but
still
the
connop
greens
either
felt
or
pretended
to
feel
great
sympathy
with
her
and
she
would
still
declare
from
time
to
time
that
lord
rufford
had
not
heard
the
last
of
her
it
was
now
more
than
a
month
since
she
had
seen
that
perjured
lord
at
mistletoe
and
more
than
a
week
since
her
father
had
brought
him
so
uselessly
up
to
london
though
determined
that
lord
rufford
should
hear
more
of
her
she
hardly
knew
how
to
go
to
work
and
on
these
days
spent
most
of
her
time
in
idle
denunciations
of
her
false
lover
then
came
her
uncle
letter
which
was
of
course
shown
to
her
she
was
quite
of
opinion
that
they
must
do
as
the
duke
directed
it
was
so
great
a
thing
to
have
the
duke
interesting
himself
in
the
matter
that
she
would
have
assented
to
anything
proposed
by
him
the
suggestion
even
inspired
some
temporary
respect
or
at
any
rate
observance
towards
her
mother
hitherto
her
mother
had
been
nobody
to
her
in
the
matter
a
person
belonging
to
her
whom
she
had
to
regard
simply
as
a
burden
she
could
not
at
all
understand
how
the
duke
had
been
guided
in
making
such
a
choice
of
a
new
emissary
but
there
it
was
under
his
own
hand
and
she
must
now
in
some
measure
submit
herself
to
her
mother
unless
she
were
prepared
to
repudiate
altogether
the
duke
assistance
as
to
lady
augustus
herself
the
suggestion
gave
to
her
quite
a
new
life
she
had
no
clear
conception
what
she
should
say
to
lord
rufford
if
the
meeting
were
arranged
but
it
was
gratifying
to
her
to
find
herself
brought
back
into
authority
over
her
daughter
she
read
the
duke
letter
to
connop
green
with
certain
very
slight
additions
or
innuendos
as
to
additions
and
was
pleased
to
find
that
the
letter
was
taken
by
connop
green
as
positive
proof
of
the
existence
of
the
engagement
she
wrote
begging
the
duke
to
allow
her
to
have
the
meeting
at
the
family
house
in
piccadilly
and
to
this
prayer
the
duke
was
obliged
to
assent
it
would
she
said
give
her
so
much
assistance
in
speaking
to
lord
rufford
she
named
a
day
also
and
then
spent
her
time
in
preparing
herself
for
the
interview
by
counsel
with
green
and
by
exacting
explanations
from
her
daughter
this
was
a
very
bad
time
for
arabella
so
bad
that
had
she
known
to
what
she
would
be
driven
she
would
probably
have
repudiated
the
duke
and
her
mother
altogether
now
my
dear
she
began
you
must
tell
me
everything
that
occurred
first
at
rufford
and
then
at
mistletoe
you
know
very
well
what
occurred
mamma
i
know
nothing
about
it
and
unless
everything
is
told
me
i
will
not
undertake
this
mission
your
uncle
evidently
thinks
that
by
my
interference
the
thing
may
be
arranged
i
have
had
the
same
idea
all
through
myself
but
as
you
have
been
so
obstinate
i
have
not
liked
to
say
so
now
arabella
begin
from
the
beginning
when
was
it
that
he
first
suggested
to
you
the
idea
of
marriage
good
heavens
mamma
i
must
have
it
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
did
he
speak
of
marriage
at
rufford
i
suppose
he
did
because
you
told
me
that
you
were
engaged
to
him
when
you
went
to
mistletoe
so
i
was
what
had
he
said
what
nonsense
how
am
i
to
remember
what
he
said
as
if
a
girl
ever
knows
what
a
man
says
to
her
did
he
kiss
you
yes
at
rufford
i
can
not
stand
this
mamma
if
you
like
to
go
you
may
go
my
uncle
seems
to
think
it
is
the
best
thing
and
so
i
suppose
it
ought
to
be
done
but
i
wo
answer
such
questions
as
you
are
asking
for
lord
rufford
and
all
that
he
possesses
what
am
i
to
say
then
how
am
i
to
call
back
to
his
recollection
the
fact
that
he
committed
himself
unless
you
will
tell
me
how
and
when
he
did
so
ask
him
if
he
did
not
assure
me
of
his
love
when
we
were
in
the
carriage
together
what
carriage
coming
home
from
hunting
was
that
at
mistletoe
or
rufford
at
mistletoe
mamma
replied
arabella
stamping
her
foot
but
you
must
let
me
know
how
it
was
that
you
became
engaged
to
him
at
rufford
mamma
you
mean
to
drive
me
mad
exclaimed
arabella
as
she
bounced
out
of
the
room
there
was
very
much
more
of
this
till
at
last
arabella
found
herself
compelled
to
invent
facts
lord
rufford
she
said
had
assured
her
of
his
everlasting
affection
in
the
little
room
at
rufford
and
had
absolutely
asked
her
to
be
his
wife
coming
home
in
the
carriage
with
her
to
stamford
she
told
herself
that
though
this
was
not
strictly
true
it
was
as
good
as
true
as
that
which
was
actually
done
and
said
by
lord
rufford
on
those
occasions
could
have
had
no
other
meaning
but
before
her
mother
had
completed
her
investigation
arabella
had
become
so
sick
of
the
matter
that
she
shut
herself
up
in
her
room
and
declared
that
nothing
on
earth
should
induce
her
to
open
her
mouth
on
the
subject
again
when
lord
rufford
received
the
letter
he
was
aghast
with
new
disgust
he
had
begun
to
flatter
himself
that
his
interview
with
lord
augustus
would
be
the
end
of
the
affair
looking
at
it
by
degrees
with
coolness
he
had
allowed
himself
to
think
that
nothing
very
terrible
could
be
done
to
him
some
few
people
particularly
interested
in
the
mistletoe
family
might
give
him
a
cold
shoulder
or
perhaps
cut
him
directly
but
such
people
would
not
belong
to
his
own
peculiar
circle
and
the
annoyance
would
not
be
great
but
if
all
the
family
one
after
another
were
to
demand
interviews
with
him
up
in
london
he
did
not
see
when
the
end
of
it
would
be
there
would
be
the
duke
himself
and
the
duchess
and
mistletoe
and
the
affair
would
in
this
way
become
gossip
for
the
whole
town
he
was
almost
minded
to
write
to
the
duke
saying
that
such
an
interview
could
do
no
good
but
at
last
he
thought
it
best
to
submit
the
matter
to
his
mentor
sir
george
penwether
sir
george
was
clearly
of
opinion
that
it
was
lord
rufford
duty
to
see
lady
augustus
yes
you
must
have
interviews
with
all
of
them
if
they
ask
it
said
sir
george
you
must
show
that
you
are
not
afraid
to
hear
what
her
friends
have
got
to
say
when
a
man
gets
wrong
he
ca
put
himself
right
without
some
little
annoyance
since
the
world
began
said
lord
rufford
i
do
think
that
there
was
ever
a
man
born
so
well
adapted
for
preaching
sermons
as
you
are
nevertheless
he
did
as
he
was
bid
and
consented
to
meet
lady
augustus
in
piccadilly
on
the
day
named
by
her
on
that
very
day
the
hounds
met
at
impington
and
lord
rufford
began
to
feel
his
punishment
he
assented
to
the
proposal
made
and
went
up
to
london
leaving
the
members
of
the
to
have
the
run
of
the
season
from
the
impington
coverts
when
lady
augustus
was
sitting
in
the
back
room
of
the
mansion
waiting
for
lord
rufford
she
was
very
much
puzzled
to
think
what
she
would
say
to
him
when
he
came
with
all
her
investigation
she
had
received
no
clear
idea
of
the
circumstances
as
they
occurred
that
her
daughter
had
told
her
a
fib
in
saying
that
she
was
engaged
when
she
went
to
mistletoe
she
was
all
but
certain
that
something
had
occurred
in
the
carriage
which
might
be
taken
for
an
offer
she
thought
possible
she
therefore
determined
to
harp
upon
the
carriage
as
much
as
possible
and
to
say
as
little
as
might
be
as
to
the
doings
at
rufford
then
as
she
was
trying
to
arrange
her
countenance
and
her
dress
and
her
voice
so
that
they
might
tell
on
his
feelings
lord
rufford
was
announced
lady
augustus
said
he
at
once
beginning
the
lesson
which
he
had
taught
himself
i
hope
i
see
you
quite
well
i
have
come
here
because
you
have
asked
me
but
i
really
do
know
that
i
have
anything
to
say
lord
rufford
you
must
hear
me
oh
yes
i
will
hear
you
certainly
only
this
kind
of
thing
is
so
painful
to
all
parties
and
i
do
see
the
use
of
it
are
you
aware
that
you
have
plunged
me
and
my
daughter
into
a
state
of
misery
too
deep
to
be
fathomed
i
should
be
sorry
to
think
that
how
can
it
be
otherwise
when
you
assure
a
girl
in
her
position
in
life
that
you
love
her
a
lady
whose
rank
is
quite
as
high
as
your
own
quite
so
quite
so
and
when
in
return
for
that
assurance
you
have
received
vows
of
love
from
her
what
is
she
to
think
and
what
are
her
friends
to
think
lord
rufford
had
always
kept
in
his
mind
a
clear
remembrance
of
the
transaction
in
the
carriage
and
was
well
aware
that
the
young
mother
had
inverted
the
circumstances
or
as
he
expressed
it
to
himself
had
put
the
cart
before
the
horse
he
had
assured
the
young
lady
that
he
loved
her
and
he
had
also
been
assured
of
her
love
but
her
assurance
had
come
first
he
felt
that
this
made
all
the
difference
in
the
world
so
much
difference
that
no
one
cognisant
in
such
matters
would
hold
that
his
assurance
obtained
after
such
a
fashion
meant
anything
at
all
but
how
was
he
to
explain
this
to
the
lady
mother
you
will
admit
that
such
assurances
were
given
continued
lady
augustus
upon
my
word
i
do
know
there
was
a
little
foolish
talk
but
it
meant
nothing
my
lord
what
am
i
to
say
i
do
want
to
give
offence
and
i
am
heartily
sorry
that
you
and
your
daughter
should
be
under
any
misapprehension
but
as
i
sit
here
there
was
no
engagement
between
us
nor
if
i
must
speak
out
lady
augustus
could
your
daughter
have
thought
that
there
was
an
engagement
did
you
not
embrace
her
i
did
that
the
truth
and
after
that
you
mean
to
say
after
that
i
mean
to
say
that
nothing
more
was
intended
there
was
a
certain
meanness
of
appearance
about
the
mother
which
emboldened
him
what
a
declaration
to
make
to
the
mother
of
a
young
lady
and
that
young
lady
the
niece
of
the
duke
of
mayfair
it
not
the
first
time
such
a
thing
has
been
done
lady
augustus
i
know
nothing
about
that
nothing
i
do
know
whom
you
may
have
lived
with
it
never
was
done
to
her
before
if
i
understand
right
she
was
engaged
to
marry
morton
when
she
came
to
rufford
it
was
all
at
an
end
before
that
at
any
rate
you
both
came
from
his
house
where
he
had
been
staying
with
mrs
morton
and
where
she
has
been
since
without
mrs
morton
lady
ushant
was
there
lord
rufford
but
she
has
been
staying
at
the
house
of
this
gentleman
to
whom
you
admit
that
she
was
engaged
a
short
time
before
she
came
to
us
he
is
on
his
and
he
thought
that
he
had
behaved
badly
to
her
she
did
go
to
bragton
the
other
day
at
his
request
merely
that
she
might
say
that
she
forgave
him
i
only
hope
that
she
will
forgive
me
too
there
is
really
nothing
else
to
be
said
if
there
were
anything
i
could
do
to
atone
to
her
for
this
trouble
if
you
only
could
know
the
brightness
of
the
hopes
you
have
shattered
and
the
purity
of
that
girl
affection
for
yourself
it
was
then
that
an
idea
a
idea
occurred
to
lord
rufford
while
all
this
was
going
on
he
had
of
course
made
various
inquiries
about
this
branch
of
the
trefoil
family
and
had
learned
that
arabella
was
altogether
portionless
he
was
told
too
that
lady
augustus
was
much
harassed
by
impecuniosity
might
it
be
possible
to
offer
a
recompense
if
i
could
do
anything
else
lady
augustus
but
really
i
am
not
a
marrying
man
then
lady
augustus
wept
bitterly
but
while
she
was
weeping
a
idea
occurred
to
her
also
it
was
clear
to
her
that
there
could
be
no
marriage
she
had
never
expected
that
there
would
be
a
marriage
but
if
this
man
who
was
rolling
in
wealth
should
offer
some
sum
of
money
to
her
daughter
something
so
considerable
as
to
divest
the
transaction
of
the
meanness
which
would
be
attached
to
a
small
bribe
something
which
might
be
really
useful
throughout
life
would
it
not
be
her
duty
on
behalf
of
her
dear
child
to
accept
such
an
offer
but
the
beginnings
of
such
dealings
are
always
difficult
could
my
lawyer
see
yours
lady
augustus
said
lord
rufford
i
do
want
the
family
lawyer
to
know
anything
about
it
said
lady
augustus
then
there
was
silence
between
them
for
a
few
moments
you
do
know
what
we
have
to
bear
lord
rufford
my
husband
has
spent
all
my
fortune
which
was
considerable
and
the
duke
does
nothing
for
us
then
he
took
a
bit
of
paper
and
writing
on
it
the
figures
pushed
it
across
the
table
she
gazed
at
the
scrap
for
a
minute
and
then
borrowing
his
pencil
without
a
word
scratched
out
his
lordship
figures
and
wrote
beneath
them
and
then
added
no
one
to
know
it
after
that
he
held
the
scrap
for
two
or
three
minutes
in
his
hands
and
then
wrote
beneath
the
figures
very
well
to
be
settled
on
your
daughter
no
one
shall
know
it
she
bowed
her
head
but
kept
the
scrap
of
paper
in
her
possession
shall
i
ring
for
your
carriage
he
asked
the
bell
was
rung
and
lady
augustus
was
taken
back
to
the
lodgings
in
orchard
street
in
the
hired
brougham
as
she
went
she
told
herself
that
if
everything
else
failed
a
year
would
support
her
daughter
or
that
in
the
event
of
any
further
matrimonial
attempt
such
a
fortune
would
be
a
great
assistance
she
had
been
sure
that
there
could
be
no
marriage
and
was
disposed
to
think
that
she
had
done
a
good
morning
work
on
behalf
of
her
unnatural
child
chapter
viii
we
shall
kill
each
other
lady
augustus
as
she
was
driven
back
to
orchard
street
and
as
she
remained
alone
during
the
rest
of
that
day
and
the
next
in
london
became
a
little
afraid
of
what
she
had
done
she
began
to
think
how
she
should
communicate
her
tidings
to
her
daughter
and
thinking
of
it
grew
to
be
nervous
and
ill
at
ease
how
would
it
be
with
her
should
arabella
still
cling
to
the
hope
of
marrying
the
lord
that
any
such
hope
would
be
altogether
illusory
lady
augustus
was
now
sure
she
had
been
quite
certain
that
there
was
no
ground
for
such
hope
when
she
had
spoken
to
the
man
of
her
own
poverty
she
was
almost
certain
that
there
had
never
been
an
offer
of
marriage
made
in
the
first
place
lord
rufford
word
went
further
with
her
than
arabella
and
then
his
story
had
been
consistent
and
probable
whereas
hers
had
been
inconsistent
and
improbable
at
any
rate
ropes
and
horses
would
not
bring
lord
rufford
to
the
hymeneal
altar
that
being
so
was
it
not
natural
that
she
should
then
have
considered
what
result
would
be
next
best
to
a
marriage
she
was
very
poor
having
saved
only
some
few
hundreds
a
year
from
the
wreck
of
her
own
fortune
independently
of
her
her
daughter
had
nothing
and
in
spite
of
this
poverty
arabella
was
very
extravagant
running
up
bills
for
finery
without
remorse
wherever
credit
could
be
found
and
excusing
herself
by
saying
that
on
this
or
that
occasion
such
expenditure
was
justified
by
the
matrimonial
prospects
which
it
opened
out
to
her
and
now
of
late
arabella
had
been
talking
of
living
separately
from
her
mother
lady
augustus
who
was
thoroughly
tired
of
her
company
was
not
at
all
averse
to
such
a
scheme
but
any
such
scheme
was
impracticable
without
money
by
a
happy
accident
the
money
would
now
be
forthcoming
there
would
be
a
year
for
ever
and
nobody
would
know
whence
it
came
she
was
confident
that
they
might
trust
to
the
lord
honour
for
secrecy
as
far
as
her
own
opinion
went
the
result
of
the
transaction
would
be
most
happy
but
still
she
feared
arabella
she
felt
that
she
would
not
know
how
to
tell
her
story
when
she
got
back
to
marygold
place
my
dear
he
wo
marry
you
but
he
is
to
give
you
that
was
what
she
would
have
to
say
but
she
doubted
her
own
courage
to
put
her
story
into
words
so
curt
and
explanatory
even
at
thirty
a
year
has
not
the
charms
which
accompany
it
to
eyes
which
have
seen
sixty
years
she
remained
in
town
that
night
and
the
next
day
and
went
down
by
train
to
basingstoke
on
the
following
morning
with
her
heart
not
altogether
free
from
trepidation
lord
rufford
the
very
moment
that
the
interview
was
over
started
off
to
his
lawyer
considering
how
very
little
had
been
given
to
him
the
sum
he
was
to
pay
was
prodigious
in
his
desire
to
get
rid
of
the
bore
of
these
appeals
he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
foolishly
generous
he
certainly
never
would
kiss
a
young
lady
in
a
carriage
again
nor
even
lend
a
horse
to
a
young
lady
till
he
was
better
acquainted
with
her
ambition
and
character
but
the
word
had
gone
from
him
and
he
must
be
as
good
as
his
word
the
girl
must
have
her
and
must
have
it
instantly
he
would
put
the
matter
into
such
a
position
that
if
any
more
interviews
were
suggested
he
might
with
perfect
safety
refer
the
suggester
back
to
miss
trefoil
there
was
to
be
secrecy
and
he
would
be
secret
as
the
grave
but
in
such
matters
one
lawyer
is
the
grave
he
had
proposed
that
two
lawyers
should
arrange
it
objection
had
been
made
to
this
because
lady
augustus
had
no
lawyer
ready
but
on
his
side
some
one
must
be
employed
so
he
went
to
his
own
solicitor
and
begged
that
the
thing
might
be
done
quite
at
once
he
was
very
definite
in
his
instructions
and
would
listen
to
no
doubts
would
the
lawyer
write
to
miss
trefoil
on
that
very
day
or
rather
not
on
that
very
day
but
the
next
as
he
suggested
this
he
thought
it
well
that
lady
augustus
should
have
an
opportunity
of
explaining
the
transaction
to
her
daughter
before
the
lawyer
letter
should
be
received
he
had
he
said
his
own
reason
for
such
haste
consequently
the
lawyer
did
prepare
the
letter
to
miss
trefoil
at
once
drafting
it
in
his
noble
client
presence
in
what
way
should
the
money
be
disposed
so
as
best
to
suit
her
convenience
the
letter
was
very
short
with
an
intimation
that
lady
augustus
would
no
doubt
have
explained
the
details
of
the
arrangement
when
lady
augustus
reached
marygold
the
family
were
at
lunch
and
as
strangers
were
present
nothing
was
said
as
to
the
great
mission
the
mother
had
already
bethought
herself
how
she
must
tell
this
and
that
lie
to
the
connop
greens
explaining
that
lord
rufford
had
confessed
his
iniquity
but
had
disclosed
that
for
certain
mysterious
reasons
he
could
not
marry
arabella
though
he
loved
her
better
than
all
the
world
arabella
asked
some
questions
about
her
mother
shopping
and
general
business
in
town
and
did
not
leave
the
room
till
she
could
do
so
without
the
slightest
appearance
of
anxiety
connop
green
marvelled
at
her
coolness
knowing
how
much
must
depend
on
the
answer
which
her
mother
had
brought
back
from
london
and
knowing
nothing
of
the
contents
of
the
letter
which
arabella
had
received
that
morning
from
the
lawyer
in
a
moment
or
two
lady
augustus
followed
her
daughter
upstairs
and
on
going
into
her
own
room
found
the
damsel
standing
in
the
middle
of
it
with
an
open
paper
in
her
hand
mamma
she
said
shut
the
door
then
the
door
was
closed
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
and
she
held
out
the
lawyer
letter
the
meaning
of
what
said
lady
augustus
trembling
i
have
no
doubt
you
know
but
you
had
better
read
it
lady
augustus
read
the
letter
and
attempted
to
smile
he
has
been
very
quick
she
said
i
thought
i
should
have
been
the
first
to
tell
you
what
is
the
meaning
of
it
why
is
the
man
to
give
me
all
that
money
is
it
not
a
good
escape
from
so
great
a
trouble
think
what
will
do
it
will
enable
you
to
live
in
comfort
wherever
you
may
please
to
go
i
am
to
understand
then
you
have
sold
me
sold
all
my
hopes
and
my
very
name
and
character
for
your
name
and
character
will
not
be
touched
my
dear
as
for
his
marrying
you
i
soon
found
that
that
was
absolutely
out
of
the
question
this
is
what
has
come
of
sending
you
to
see
him
of
course
i
shall
tell
my
uncle
everything
you
will
do
no
such
thing
arabella
do
not
make
a
fool
of
yourself
do
you
know
what
will
do
for
you
it
is
to
be
your
own
absolutely
beyond
my
reach
or
your
father
i
would
sooner
go
into
the
thames
off
waterloo
bridge
than
touch
a
farthing
of
his
money
said
arabella
with
a
spirit
which
the
other
woman
did
not
at
all
understand
hitherto
in
all
these
little
dirty
ways
they
had
run
with
equal
steps
the
pretences
the
subterfuges
the
lies
of
the
one
had
always
been
open
to
the
other
arabella
earnest
in
supplying
herself
with
gloves
from
the
pockets
of
her
male
acquaintances
had
endured
her
mother
tricks
with
complacency
she
had
condescended
when
living
in
humble
lodgings
to
date
her
letters
from
a
hotel
and
had
not
feared
to
declare
that
she
had
done
so
in
their
family
conversations
together
they
had
fished
in
turbid
waters
for
marital
nibbles
and
had
told
mutual
falsehoods
to
unbelieving
tradesmen
and
yet
the
younger
woman
when
tempted
with
a
bribe
worth
lies
and
tricks
as
deep
and
as
black
as
acheron
now
stood
on
her
dignity
and
her
purity
and
stamped
her
foot
with
honest
indignation
i
do
think
you
can
understand
it
said
lady
augustus
i
can
understand
this
that
you
have
betrayed
me
and
that
i
shall
tell
him
so
in
the
plainest
words
that
i
can
use
to
get
his
lawyer
to
write
and
offer
me
money
he
should
not
have
gone
to
his
lawyer
i
do
think
he
was
wrong
there
but
you
settled
it
with
him
you
my
mother
a
price
at
which
he
should
buy
himself
off
would
he
have
offered
me
money
if
he
did
not
know
that
he
had
bound
himself
to
me
nothing
on
earth
would
make
him
marry
you
i
would
not
for
a
moment
have
allowed
him
to
allude
to
money
if
that
had
not
been
quite
certain
who
proposed
the
money
first
lady
augustus
considered
a
moment
before
she
answered
upon
my
word
my
dear
i
ca
say
he
wrote
the
figures
on
a
bit
of
paper
that
was
the
way
then
she
produced
the
scrap
he
wrote
the
figures
first
and
then
i
altered
them
just
as
you
see
the
proposition
came
first
from
him
of
course
and
you
did
not
spit
at
him
said
arabella
as
she
tore
the
scrap
into
fragments
arabella
said
the
mother
it
is
clear
that
you
do
not
look
into
the
future
how
do
you
mean
to
live
you
are
getting
old
old
yes
my
love
old
of
course
i
am
willing
to
do
everything
for
you
as
i
always
have
done
for
so
many
years
but
there
is
a
man
in
london
who
does
not
know
how
long
you
have
been
about
it
hold
your
tongue
mamma
said
arabella
jumping
up
that
is
all
very
well
but
the
truth
has
to
be
spoken
you
and
i
can
not
go
on
as
we
have
been
doing
certainly
not
i
would
sooner
be
in
a
workhouse
and
here
there
is
provided
for
you
an
income
on
which
you
can
live
not
a
soul
will
know
anything
about
it
even
your
own
father
need
not
be
told
as
for
the
lawyer
that
is
nothing
they
never
talk
of
things
it
would
make
a
man
comparatively
poor
quite
a
fit
match
or
if
you
do
not
marry
it
would
enable
you
to
live
where
you
pleased
independently
of
me
you
had
better
think
twice
of
it
before
you
refuse
it
i
will
not
think
of
it
at
all
as
sure
as
i
am
living
here
i
will
write
to
rufford
this
very
evening
and
tell
him
in
what
light
i
regard
both
him
and
you
and
what
will
you
do
then
hang
myself
that
is
all
very
well
arabella
but
hanging
yourself
and
jumping
off
waterloo
bridge
do
not
mean
anything
you
must
live
and
you
must
pay
your
debts
i
ca
pay
them
for
you
you
go
into
your
own
room
and
think
of
it
all
and
be
thankful
for
what
providence
has
sent
you
you
may
as
well
understand
that
i
am
in
earnest
the
daughter
said
as
she
left
the
room
i
shall
write
to
lord
rufford
and
tell
him
what
i
think
of
him
and
his
money
you
need
not
trouble
yourself
as
to
what
shall
be
done
with
it
for
i
certainly
shall
not
take
it
and
she
did
write
to
lord
rufford
as
follows
my
lord
i
have
been
much
astonished
by
a
letter
i
have
received
from
a
gentleman
in
london
shaw
who
i
presume
is
your
lawyer
when
i
received
it
i
had
not
as
yet
seen
mamma
i
now
understand
that
you
and
she
between
you
have
determined
that
i
should
be
compensated
by
a
sum
of
money
for
the
injury
you
have
done
me
i
scorn
your
money
i
can
not
think
where
you
found
the
audacity
to
make
such
a
proposal
or
how
you
have
taught
yourself
to
imagine
that
i
should
listen
to
it
as
to
mamma
she
was
not
commissioned
to
act
for
me
and
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
anything
she
may
have
said
i
can
hardly
believe
that
she
should
have
agreed
to
such
a
proposal
it
was
very
little
like
a
gentleman
in
you
to
offer
it
why
did
you
offer
it
you
would
not
have
proposed
to
give
me
a
large
sum
of
money
like
that
without
some
reason
i
have
been
shocked
to
hear
that
you
have
denied
that
you
ever
engaged
yourself
to
me
you
know
that
you
were
engaged
to
me
it
would
have
been
more
honest
and
more
manly
if
you
had
declared
at
once
that
you
repented
of
your
engagement
but
the
truth
is
that
till
i
see
you
myself
and
hear
what
you
have
to
say
out
of
your
own
mouth
i
can
not
believe
what
other
people
tell
me
i
must
ask
you
to
name
some
place
where
we
can
meet
as
for
this
offer
of
money
it
goes
for
nothing
you
must
have
known
that
i
would
not
take
it
arabella
it
was
now
just
the
end
of
february
and
the
visit
of
the
trefoil
ladies
to
the
connop
greens
had
to
come
to
an
end
they
had
already
overstaid
the
time
at
first
arranged
and
lady
augustus
when
she
hinted
that
another
week
at
marygold
just
till
this
painful
affair
was
finally
settled
would
be
beneficial
to
her
was
informed
that
the
connop
greens
themselves
were
about
to
leave
home
lady
augustus
had
reported
to
connop
green
that
lord
rufford
was
behaving
very
badly
but
that
the
matter
was
still
in
a
transition
state
connop
green
was
very
sorry
but
so
lady
augustus
and
arabella
betook
themselves
to
orchard
street
being
at
that
moment
unable
to
enter
in
upon
better
quarters
what
a
home
it
was
and
what
a
journey
up
to
town
arabella
had
told
her
mother
that
the
letter
to
lord
rufford
had
been
written
and
posted
and
since
that
hardly
a
word
had
passed
between
them
when
they
left
marygold
in
the
connop
green
carriage
they
smiled
and
shook
hands
and
kissed
their
friends
in
unison
and
then
sank
back
into
silence
at
the
station
they
walked
up
and
down
the
platform
together
for
the
sake
of
appearance
but
did
not
speak
in
the
train
there
were
others
with
them
and
they
both
feigned
to
be
asleep
then
they
were
driven
to
their
lodgings
in
a
cab
still
speechless
it
was
the
mother
who
first
saw
that
the
horror
of
this
if
continued
would
be
too
great
to
be
endured
arabella
she
said
in
a
hoarse
voice
why
do
you
speak
because
i
got
nothing
to
say
that
nonsense
there
is
always
something
to
say
you
have
ruined
me
mamma
just
ruined
me
i
did
for
you
the
very
best
i
could
if
you
would
have
been
advised
by
me
instead
of
being
ruined
you
would
have
had
a
handsome
fortune
i
have
slaved
for
you
for
the
last
twelve
years
no
mother
ever
sacrificed
herself
for
her
child
more
than
i
have
done
for
you
and
now
see
the
return
i
get
i
sometimes
think
that
it
will
kill
me
that
nonsense
everything
i
say
is
nonsense
while
you
tell
me
one
day
that
you
are
going
to
hang
yourself
and
another
day
that
you
will
drown
yourself
so
i
would
if
i
dared
what
is
it
that
you
have
brought
me
to
who
will
have
me
in
their
houses
when
they
hear
that
you
consented
to
take
lord
rufford
money
nobody
will
hear
it
unless
you
tell
them
i
shall
tell
my
uncle
and
my
aunt
and
mistletoe
in
order
that
they
may
know
how
it
is
that
lord
rufford
has
been
allowed
to
escape
i
say
that
you
have
ruined
me
if
it
had
not
been
for
your
vulgar
bargain
with
him
he
must
have
been
brought
to
keep
his
word
at
last
oh
that
he
should
have
ever
thought
it
was
possible
that
i
was
to
be
bought
off
for
a
sum
of
money
later
on
in
the
evening
the
mother
again
implored
her
daughter
to
speak
to
her
what
the
use
mamma
when
you
know
what
we
think
of
each
other
what
the
good
of
pretending
there
is
nobody
here
to
hear
us
later
on
still
she
herself
began
i
do
know
how
much
you
got
mamma
but
whatever
it
is
we
better
divide
it
after
what
you
did
in
piccadilly
we
shall
never
get
on
together
again
there
is
not
enough
to
divide
said
lady
augustus
if
i
had
not
you
to
go
about
with
me
i
could
get
taken
in
pretty
nearly
all
the
year
round
who
take
you
leave
that
to
me
i
would
manage
it
and
you
could
join
with
some
other
old
person
we
shall
kill
each
other
if
we
stay
like
this
said
arabella
as
she
took
up
her
candle
you
have
pretty
nearly
killed
me
as
it
is
said
the
old
woman
as
the
other
shut
the
door
chapter
ix
changes
at
bragton
day
after
day
old
morton
urged
her
purpose
with
her
grandson
at
bragton
not
quite
directly
as
she
had
done
at
first
but
by
gradual
approaches
and
little
soft
attempts
made
in
the
midst
of
all
the
tenderness
which
as
a
nurse
she
was
able
to
display
it
soon
came
to
pass
that
the
intruders
were
banished
from
the
house
or
almost
banished
mary
daily
visits
were
discontinued
immediately
after
that
last
walk
home
with
reginald
morton
which
has
been
described
twice
in
the
course
of
the
next
week
she
went
over
but
on
both
occasions
she
did
so
early
in
the
day
and
returned
alone
just
as
he
was
reaching
the
house
and
then
before
a
week
was
over
early
in
march
lady
ushant
told
the
invalid
that
she
would
be
better
away
morton
does
like
me
she
said
and
i
had
better
go
but
i
shall
stay
for
a
while
at
hoppet
hall
and
come
in
and
see
you
from
time
to
time
till
you
get
better
john
morton
replied
that
he
should
never
get
better
but
though
he
said
so
then
there
was
at
times
evidence
that
he
did
not
yet
quite
despond
as
to
himself
he
could
still
talk
to
morton
of
buying
chowton
farm
and
was
very
anxious
that
he
should
not
be
forgotten
at
the
foreign
office
lady
ushant
had
herself
driven
to
hoppet
hall
and
there
took
up
her
residence
with
her
nephew
every
other
day
runciman
fly
came
for
her
and
carried
her
backwards
and
forwards
to
bragton
on
those
occasions
she
would
remain
an
hour
with
the
invalid
and
then
would
go
back
again
never
even
seeing
morton
though
always
seen
by
her
and
twice
after
this
banishment
reginald
walked
over
but
on
the
second
occasion
there
was
a
scene
morton
to
whom
he
had
never
spoken
since
he
was
a
boy
met
him
in
the
hall
and
told
him
that
his
visits
only
disturbed
his
sick
cousin
i
certainly
will
not
disturb
him
reginald
had
said
in
the
condition
in
which
he
is
now
he
should
not
see
many
people
rejoined
the
lady
if
you
will
ask
fanning
he
will
tell
you
the
same
fanning
was
the
london
doctor
who
came
down
once
a
week
whom
it
was
improbable
that
reginald
should
have
an
opportunity
of
consulting
but
he
remembered
or
thought
that
he
remembered
that
his
cousin
had
been
fretful
and
during
his
last
visit
and
so
turned
himself
round
and
went
home
without
another
word
i
am
afraid
there
may
be
i
do
know
what
said
lady
ushant
to
him
in
a
whisper
the
next
morning
what
do
you
mean
i
do
know
what
i
mean
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
say
a
word
only
so
much
does
depend
on
it
if
you
are
thinking
about
the
property
aunt
wipe
it
out
of
your
mind
let
him
do
what
he
pleases
and
do
think
about
it
no
one
should
trouble
their
minds
about
such
things
it
is
his
to
do
what
he
pleases
with
it
it
is
not
him
that
i
fear
reginald
if
he
chooses
to
be
guided
by
her
who
shall
say
that
he
is
wrong
get
it
out
of
your
mind
the
very
thinking
about
such
things
is
dirtiness
the
poor
old
lady
submitted
to
the
rebuke
and
did
not
dare
to
say
another
word
daily
lady
ushant
would
send
over
for
mary
masters
thinking
it
cruel
that
her
young
friend
should
leave
her
alone
and
yet
understanding
in
part
the
reason
why
mary
did
not
come
to
her
constantly
at
hoppet
hall
poor
mary
was
troubled
much
by
these
messages
of
course
she
went
now
and
again
she
had
no
alternative
but
to
go
and
yet
feeling
that
the
house
was
his
house
she
was
most
unwilling
to
enter
it
then
grew
within
her
a
feeling
which
she
could
not
analyse
that
he
had
her
of
course
she
was
not
entitled
to
his
love
she
would
acknowledge
to
herself
over
and
over
again
that
he
had
never
spoken
a
word
to
her
which
could
justify
her
in
expecting
his
love
but
why
had
he
not
let
her
alone
why
had
he
striven
by
his
words
and
his
society
to
make
her
other
than
she
would
have
been
had
she
been
left
to
the
atmosphere
of
her
stepmother
home
why
had
he
spoken
so
strongly
to
her
as
to
that
young
man
love
and
then
she
was
almost
angry
with
him
because
by
a
turn
in
the
wheel
of
fortune
he
was
about
to
become
as
she
thought
squire
of
bragton
had
he
remained
simply
morton
of
hoppet
hall
it
would
still
have
been
impossible
but
this
exaltation
of
her
idol
altogether
out
of
her
reach
was
an
added
injustice
she
could
remember
not
the
person
but
all
the
recent
memories
of
the
old
squire
the
veneration
with
which
he
was
named
the
masterdom
which
was
attributed
to
him
the
unequalled
nobility
of
his
position
in
regard
to
dillsborough
his
successor
would
be
to
her
as
some
one
crowned
and
removed
by
his
crown
altogether
from
her
world
then
she
pictured
to
herself
the
stately
dame
who
would
certainly
come
and
she
made
fresh
resolutions
with
a
sore
heart
i
do
know
why
you
should
be
so
very
little
with
me
said
lady
ushant
almost
whining
when
i
was
at
cheltenham
you
wanted
to
come
to
me
there
are
so
many
things
to
be
done
at
home
and
yet
you
would
have
come
to
cheltenham
we
were
in
great
trouble
then
lady
ushant
of
course
i
would
like
to
be
with
you
you
ought
not
to
scold
me
because
you
know
how
i
love
you
has
the
young
man
gone
away
altogether
now
mary
altogether
and
masters
is
satisfied
she
knows
it
can
never
be
and
therefore
she
is
quiet
about
it
i
was
sorry
for
that
young
man
because
he
was
so
true
you
could
be
more
sorry
than
i
was
lady
ushant
i
love
him
as
though
he
were
a
brother
but
mary
dear
mary
i
fear
you
are
in
trouble
i
think
it
is
all
trouble
said
mary
rushing
forward
and
hiding
her
face
in
her
old
friend
lap
as
she
knelt
on
the
ground
before
her
lady
ushant
longed
to
ask
a
question
but
she
did
not
dare
and
mary
masters
longed
to
have
one
friend
to
whom
she
could
confide
her
secret
but
neither
did
she
dare
on
the
next
day
very
early
in
the
morning
there
came
a
note
from
morton
to
masters
the
attorney
could
masters
come
out
on
that
day
to
bragton
and
see
morton
the
note
was
very
particular
in
saying
that
morton
was
to
be
the
person
seen
the
messenger
who
waited
for
an
answer
brought
back
word
that
masters
would
be
there
at
noon
the
circumstance
was
one
which
agitated
him
considerably
as
he
had
not
been
inside
the
house
at
bragton
since
the
days
immediately
following
the
death
of
the
old
squire
as
it
happened
lady
ushant
was
going
to
bragton
on
the
same
day
and
at
the
suggestion
of
runciman
whose
horses
in
the
hunting
season
barely
sufficed
for
his
trade
the
old
lady
and
the
lawyer
went
together
not
a
word
was
said
between
them
as
to
the
cause
which
took
either
of
them
on
their
journey
but
they
spoke
much
of
the
days
in
which
they
had
known
each
other
when
the
old
squire
was
alive
and
masters
thanked
lady
ushant
for
her
kindness
to
his
daughter
i
love
her
almost
as
though
she
were
my
own
said
lady
ushant
when
i
am
dead
she
will
have
half
of
what
i
have
got
she
will
have
no
right
to
expect
that
said
the
gratified
father
she
will
have
half
or
the
whole
just
as
reginald
may
be
situated
then
i
do
know
why
i
should
tell
her
father
what
it
is
i
mean
to
do
the
attorney
knew
to
a
shilling
the
amount
of
lady
income
and
thought
that
this
was
the
best
news
he
had
heard
for
many
a
day
while
lady
ushant
was
in
the
sick
man
room
morton
was
closeted
with
the
attorney
she
had
thought
much
of
this
step
before
she
had
dared
to
take
it
and
even
now
doubted
whether
it
would
avail
her
anything
as
she
entered
the
in
which
masters
was
seated
she
almost
repented
but
the
man
was
there
and
she
was
compelled
to
go
on
with
her
scheme
masters
she
said
it
is
i
think
a
long
time
since
you
have
been
employed
by
this
family
a
very
long
time
madam
and
i
have
now
sent
for
you
under
circumstances
of
great
difficulty
she
answered
but
as
he
said
nothing
she
was
forced
to
go
on
my
grandson
made
his
will
the
other
day
up
in
london
when
he
thought
that
he
was
going
out
to
patagonia
masters
bowed
it
was
done
when
he
was
in
sound
health
and
he
is
now
not
satisfied
with
it
then
there
was
another
bow
but
not
a
word
was
spoken
of
course
you
know
that
he
is
very
we
have
all
been
very
much
grieved
to
hear
it
i
am
sure
you
would
be
for
the
sake
of
old
days
when
fanning
was
last
here
he
thought
that
my
grandson
was
something
better
he
held
out
stronger
hopes
than
before
but
still
he
is
very
his
mind
has
never
wavered
for
a
moment
mr
masters
again
masters
bowed
and
now
he
thinks
that
some
changes
should
be
made
indeed
that
there
should
be
a
new
will
does
he
wish
me
to
see
him
mrs
morton
not
i
think
he
is
not
quite
prepared
but
i
wanted
to
ask
whether
you
could
come
at
a
moment
notice
quite
at
a
moment
notice
i
thought
it
better
so
that
you
should
know
why
we
sent
for
you
if
we
did
send
so
that
you
might
be
prepared
it
could
be
done
here
i
suppose
it
would
be
possible
mrs
morton
and
you
could
do
it
then
there
was
a
long
pause
altering
a
will
is
a
very
serious
thing
morton
and
when
it
is
done
on
what
perhaps
may
be
a
it
is
a
very
serious
thing
indeed
morton
i
believe
employs
a
london
solicitor
i
know
the
firm
and
more
respectable
gentlemen
do
not
exist
a
telegram
would
bring
down
one
of
the
firm
from
london
by
the
next
train
a
frown
a
very
heavy
frown
came
across
the
old
woman
brow
she
would
have
repressed
it
had
it
been
possible
but
she
could
not
command
herself
and
the
frown
was
there
if
that
had
been
practicable
masters
she
said
we
should
not
have
sent
for
you
i
was
only
suggesting
madame
what
might
be
the
best
course
exactly
and
of
course
i
am
much
obliged
but
if
we
are
driven
to
call
upon
you
for
your
assistance
we
shall
find
it
madame
said
the
attorney
very
slowly
it
is
of
course
part
of
my
business
to
make
wills
and
when
called
upon
to
do
so
i
perform
my
business
to
the
best
of
my
ability
but
in
altering
a
will
during
illness
great
care
is
necessary
a
codicil
might
be
added
a
new
will
would
be
necessary
a
new
will
thought
the
attorney
could
only
be
necessary
for
altering
the
disposition
of
the
whole
estate
he
knew
enough
of
the
family
circumstances
to
be
aware
that
the
property
should
go
to
reginald
morton
whether
with
or
without
a
will
and
also
enough
to
be
aware
that
this
old
lady
was
reginald
bitter
enemy
he
did
not
think
that
he
could
bring
himself
to
take
instructions
from
a
dying
man
from
the
squire
of
bragton
on
his
for
an
instrument
which
should
alienate
the
property
from
the
proper
heir
he
too
had
his
strong
feelings
perhaps
his
prejudices
about
bragton
i
would
wish
that
the
task
were
in
other
hands
mrs
morton
why
so
it
is
hard
to
measure
the
capacity
of
an
invalid
his
mind
is
as
clear
as
yours
it
might
be
so
and
yet
i
might
not
be
able
to
satisfy
myself
that
it
was
so
i
should
have
to
ask
long
and
tedious
questions
which
would
be
offensive
and
i
should
find
myself
giving
advice
which
would
not
be
called
for
for
instance
were
your
grandson
to
wish
to
leave
this
estate
away
from
the
heir
i
am
not
discussing
his
wishes
mr
masters
i
beg
your
pardon
morton
for
making
the
suggestion
but
as
i
said
before
i
should
prefer
that
he
should
employ
some
one
else
you
refuse
then
if
morton
were
to
send
for
me
i
should
go
to
him
instantly
but
i
fear
i
might
be
slow
in
taking
his
instructions
and
it
is
possible
that
i
might
refuse
to
act
on
them
then
she
got
up
from
her
chair
and
bowing
to
him
with
stately
displeasure
left
the
room
all
this
she
had
done
without
any
authority
from
her
grandson
simply
encouraged
in
her
object
by
his
saying
in
his
weakness
that
he
would
think
of
her
proposition
so
intent
was
she
on
her
business
that
she
was
resolved
to
have
everything
ready
if
only
he
could
once
be
brought
to
say
that
peter
morton
should
be
his
heir
having
abandoned
all
hopes
for
her
noble
cousin
she
could
tell
her
conscience
that
she
was
instigated
simply
by
an
idea
of
justice
peter
morton
was
at
any
rate
the
legitimate
son
of
a
father
and
a
mother
what
had
she
or
any
one
belonging
to
her
to
gain
by
it
but
forty
years
since
a
brat
had
been
born
at
bragton
in
opposition
to
her
wishes
by
whose
means
she
had
been
expelled
from
the
place
and
now
it
seemed
to
her
to
be
simple
justice
that
he
should
on
this
account
be
robbed
of
that
which
would
otherwise
be
naturally
his
own
as
masters
would
not
serve
her
turn
she
must
write
to
the
london
lawyers
the
thing
would
be
more
difficult
but
nevertheless
if
the
sick
man
could
once
be
got
to
say
that
peter
should
be
his
heir
she
thought
that
she
could
keep
him
to
his
word
lady
ushant
and
masters
went
back
to
dillsborough
in
runciman
fly
and
it
need
hardly
be
said
that
the
attorney
said
nothing
of
the
business
which
had
taken
him
to
bragton
this
happened
on
a
wednesday
wednesday
the
of
march
on
friday
morning
at
during
the
darkness
of
the
night
john
morton
was
lying
dead
on
his
bed
and
the
old
woman
was
at
his
bedside
she
had
done
her
duty
by
him
as
far
as
she
knew
how
in
tending
him
had
been
assiduous
with
the
diligence
of
much
younger
years
but
now
as
she
sat
there
having
had
the
fact
absolutely
announced
to
her
by
nupper
her
greatest
agony
arose
from
the
feeling
that
the
roof
which
covered
her
probably
the
chair
in
which
she
sat
were
the
property
of
reginald
morton
bastard
she
said
to
herself
between
her
teeth
but
she
so
said
it
that
neither
nupper
who
was
in
the
room
nor
the
woman
who
was
with
her
should
hear
it
nupper
took
the
news
into
dillsborough
and
as
the
folk
sat
down
to
breakfast
they
all
heard
that
the
squire
of
bragton
was
dead
the
man
had
been
too
little
known
had
been
too
short
a
time
in
the
neighbourhood
to
give
occasion
for
tears
there
was
certainly
more
of
interest
than
of
grief
in
the
matter
masters
said
to
himself
that
the
time
had
been
too
short
for
any
change
in
the
will
and
therefore
felt
tolerably
certain
that
reginald
would
be
the
heir
but
for
some
days
this
opinion
was
not
general
in
dillsborough
mainwaring
had
heard
that
reginald
had
been
sent
away
from
bragton
with
a
flea
in
his
ear
and
was
pretty
certain
that
when
the
will
was
read
it
would
be
found
that
the
property
was
to
go
to
friends
nupper
was
of
the
same
opinion
there
were
many
in
dillsborough
with
whom
reginald
was
not
popular
and
who
thought
that
some
man
of
a
different
kind
would
do
better
as
squire
of
bragton
he
do
know
a
fox
when
he
sees
said
tony
tuppett
to
larry
twentyman
whom
he
had
come
across
the
county
to
call
upon
and
to
console
chapter
x
the
will
on
that
saturday
the
club
met
at
dillsborough
even
though
the
squire
of
bragton
had
died
on
friday
morning
through
the
whole
of
that
saturday
the
town
had
been
much
exercised
in
its
belief
and
expressions
as
to
the
disposition
of
the
property
the
town
knew
very
well
that
masters
the
attorney
had
been
sent
for
to
bragton
on
the
previous
wednesday
whence
the
deduction
as
to
a
new
will
made
of
course
under
the
auspices
of
morton
would
have
been
quite
plain
to
the
town
had
not
a
portion
of
the
town
heard
that
the
attorney
had
not
been
for
a
moment
with
the
dying
man
during
his
visit
this
latter
piece
of
information
had
come
through
lady
ushant
who
had
been
in
her
nephew
bedroom
the
whole
time
but
lady
ushant
had
not
much
personal
communication
with
the
town
generally
and
would
probably
have
said
nothing
on
this
subject
had
not
runciman
walked
up
to
hoppet
hall
behind
the
fly
after
masters
had
left
it
and
while
helping
her
ladyship
out
made
inquiry
as
to
the
condition
of
things
at
bragton
generally
i
was
sorry
to
hear
of
their
sending
for
any
lawyer
said
runciman
then
lady
ushant
protested
that
the
lawyer
had
not
been
sent
for
by
her
nephew
and
that
her
nephew
had
not
even
seen
him
oh
indeed
said
runciman
who
immediately
took
a
walk
round
his
own
paddock
with
the
object
of
putting
two
and
two
together
runciman
was
a
discreet
man
and
did
not
allow
this
piece
of
information
to
spread
itself
generally
he
told
nupper
and
hampton
and
lord
rufford
for
the
hounds
went
out
on
friday
though
the
squire
of
bragton
was
lying
dead
but
he
did
not
tell
mainwaring
whom
he
encountered
in
the
street
of
the
town
as
he
was
coming
home
early
and
who
was
very
keen
to
learn
whatever
news
there
was
reginald
morton
on
friday
did
not
go
near
bragton
that
of
course
was
palpable
to
all
and
was
a
great
sign
that
he
himself
did
not
regard
himself
as
the
heir
he
had
for
awhile
been
very
intimate
at
the
house
visiting
it
daily
and
during
a
part
of
that
time
the
grandmother
had
been
altogether
absent
then
she
had
come
back
and
he
had
discontinued
his
visits
and
now
he
did
not
even
go
over
to
seal
up
the
drawers
and
to
make
arrangements
as
to
the
funeral
he
did
not
at
any
rate
go
on
the
friday
nor
on
the
saturday
and
on
the
saturday
wobytrade
the
undertaker
had
received
orders
from
morton
to
go
at
once
to
bragton
all
this
was
felt
to
be
strong
against
reginald
but
when
it
was
discovered
that
on
the
saturday
afternoon
morton
herself
had
gone
up
to
london
not
waiting
even
for
the
coming
of
any
one
else
to
take
possession
of
the
house
and
that
she
had
again
carried
all
her
own
personal
luggage
with
her
then
opinion
in
dillsborough
again
veered
upon
the
whole
the
betting
was
a
point
or
two
in
favour
of
reginald
when
the
club
met
masters
who
had
been
much
quelled
of
late
had
been
urgent
with
her
husband
to
go
over
to
the
bush
but
he
was
unwilling
he
said
to
be
making
jolly
while
the
squire
of
bragton
was
lying
unburied
he
was
nothing
to
you
gregory
said
his
wife
who
had
in
vain
endeavoured
to
learn
from
him
why
he
had
been
summoned
to
bragton
you
will
hear
something
over
there
and
it
will
relieve
your
spirits
so
instigated
he
did
go
across
and
found
all
the
accustomed
members
of
the
club
congregated
in
the
room
even
larry
twentyman
was
present
who
of
late
had
kept
himself
aloof
from
all
such
meetings
both
the
botseys
were
there
and
nupper
and
harry
stubbings
and
ribbs
the
butcher
runciman
himself
of
course
was
in
the
room
and
he
had
introduced
on
this
occasion
captain
glomax
the
master
of
the
hunt
who
was
staying
at
his
house
that
night
perhaps
with
a
view
to
hunting
duties
on
the
monday
perhaps
in
order
that
he
might
hear
something
as
to
the
bragton
property
it
had
already
been
suggested
to
him
that
he
might
possibly
hire
the
house
for
a
year
or
two
at
little
more
than
a
nominal
rent
that
the
old
kennels
might
be
resuscitated
and
that
such
arrangements
would
be
in
all
respects
convenient
he
was
the
master
of
the
hunt
and
of
course
there
was
no
difficulty
as
to
introducing
him
to
the
club
captain
glomax
was
speaking
in
a
somewhat
dictatorial
voice
as
becomes
a
master
of
hounds
when
in
the
field
though
perhaps
it
should
be
dropped
afterwards
when
the
attorney
entered
there
was
a
sudden
rise
of
voices
striving
to
interrupt
the
captain
as
it
was
felt
by
them
all
that
masters
must
be
in
possession
of
information
but
the
captain
himself
went
on
of
course
it
is
the
place
for
the
hounds
nobody
can
doubt
that
who
knows
the
country
and
understands
the
working
of
it
the
hunt
ought
to
have
subscribed
and
hired
the
kennels
and
stables
permanently
there
would
have
wanted
two
to
that
bargain
captain
said
runciman
of
course
there
would
but
what
would
you
think
of
a
man
who
would
refuse
such
a
proposition
when
he
did
want
the
place
himself
do
you
think
if
i
been
there
foxes
would
have
been
poisoned
in
dillsborough
wood
i
have
had
that
fellow
goarly
under
my
thumb
then
you
have
had
an
awful
blackguard
under
your
thumb
captain
glomax
said
larry
who
could
not
restrain
his
wrath
when
name
was
mentioned
what
does
that
matter
if
you
get
foxes
continued
the
master
but
the
fact
is
gentlemen
in
a
county
like
this
always
want
to
have
everything
done
for
them
and
never
to
do
anything
for
themselves
i
sick
of
it
i
know
nobody
is
fonder
of
hunting
a
country
than
i
am
and
i
think
i
know
what
i
about
that
you
do
said
fred
botsey
who
like
most
men
was
always
ready
to
flatter
the
master
and
i
do
care
how
hard
i
work
from
the
first
of
august
till
the
end
of
may
i
never
have
a
day
to
myself
what
with
cubbing
and
then
the
season
and
entering
the
young
hounds
and
buying
and
selling
horses
by
george
i
at
it
the
whole
year
a
master
of
hounds
looks
for
that
captain
said
the
innkeeper
looks
for
it
yes
he
must
look
for
it
but
i
would
mind
that
if
i
could
get
gentlemen
to
pull
a
little
with
me
i
ca
stand
being
out
of
pocket
as
i
have
been
and
so
i
must
let
them
know
if
the
country
would
get
the
kennels
and
the
stables
and
lay
out
a
few
pounds
so
that
horses
and
hounds
and
men
could
go
into
them
i
would
mind
having
a
shot
for
the
house
it
killing
work
where
i
am
now
the
other
side
of
rufford
you
may
say
then
he
stopped
but
no
one
would
undertake
to
answer
him
the
meaning
of
it
was
that
captain
glomax
wanted
a
year
more
than
he
received
and
every
one
there
knew
that
there
was
not
a
year
more
to
be
got
out
of
the
country
unless
lord
rufford
would
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
now
the
present
stables
and
the
present
kennels
had
been
made
comfortable
by
lord
rufford
and
it
was
not
thought
probable
that
he
would
pay
for
the
move
to
bragton
when
the
funeral
to
be
mr
masters
asked
runciman
who
knew
very
well
the
day
fixed
but
who
thought
it
well
to
get
back
to
the
subject
of
real
interest
in
the
town
next
thursday
i
told
there
no
hurry
with
weather
like
this
said
nupper
professionally
they
ca
open
the
will
till
the
late
squire
is
buried
continued
the
innkeeper
and
there
will
be
one
or
two
very
anxious
to
know
what
is
in
it
i
suppose
it
will
all
go
to
the
man
who
lives
up
here
at
hoppet
hall
said
the
captain
a
man
that
was
never
outside
a
horse
in
his
life
he
not
a
bad
fellow
said
runciman
he
is
a
very
good
fellow
said
the
attorney
and
i
trust
he
may
have
the
property
if
it
be
left
away
from
him
i
for
one
shall
think
that
a
great
injustice
has
been
done
this
was
listened
to
with
attention
as
every
one
there
thought
that
masters
must
know
i
ca
understand
said
glomax
how
any
man
can
be
considered
a
good
fellow
as
a
country
gentleman
who
does
not
care
for
sport
just
look
at
it
all
round
suppose
others
were
like
him
what
would
become
of
us
all
yes
indeed
what
would
become
of
us
asked
the
two
botseys
in
a
breath
ho
our
runciman
suggested
harry
stubbings
with
a
laugh
think
what
england
would
be
said
the
captain
when
i
hear
of
a
country
gentleman
sticking
to
books
and
all
that
i
feel
that
the
glory
is
departing
from
the
land
where
are
the
sinews
of
war
to
come
from
that
what
i
want
to
know
who
will
it
be
masters
if
the
gent
do
get
it
asked
ribbs
from
his
corner
on
the
sofa
this
was
felt
to
be
a
pushing
question
how
am
i
to
know
mr
ribbs
said
the
attorney
i
did
make
the
late
will
and
if
i
did
you
do
suppose
i
should
tell
you
i
told
that
the
next
is
peter
morton
said
fred
botsey
something
in
a
public
office
up
in
london
it
wo
go
to
him
said
fred
brother
that
old
lady
has
relations
of
her
own
who
have
had
their
mouths
open
for
the
last
forty
years
away
from
the
mortons
altogether
said
harry
that
would
be
an
awful
shame
i
do
see
what
good
the
mortons
have
done
this
last
half
century
said
the
captain
you
do
remember
the
old
squire
captain
said
the
innkeeper
and
i
do
remember
him
well
indeed
i
was
only
a
little
chap
when
they
buried
him
but
there
that
feeling
left
behind
him
to
this
day
that
not
a
poor
man
in
the
country
would
be
sorry
to
think
that
there
was
a
morton
left
among
of
course
a
hunting
gentleman
is
a
good
thing
about
the
best
thing
out
said
the
captain
but
a
hunting
gentleman
is
everything
i
know
nothing
of
the
old
lady
people
only
this
that
none
of
their
money
ever
came
into
dillsborough
i
all
for
reginald
morton
he
my
landlord
as
it
is
and
he
a
gentleman
i
hate
foreigners
coming
said
ribbs
ai
too
old
to
take
it
yet
said
harry
fred
botsey
declared
that
he
did
believe
in
men
hunting
unless
they
began
young
whereupon
nupper
declared
that
he
had
never
ridden
over
a
fence
till
he
was
and
that
he
was
ready
now
to
ride
fred
across
country
for
a
new
hat
larry
suggested
that
a
man
might
be
a
good
friend
to
sport
though
he
did
ride
much
himself
and
runciman
again
asserted
that
hunting
was
everything
upon
the
whole
reginald
was
the
favourite
but
the
occasion
was
so
special
that
a
little
supper
was
ordered
and
i
fear
the
attorney
did
not
get
home
till
after
twelve
till
the
news
reached
hoppet
hall
that
morton
had
taken
herself
off
to
london
there
was
great
doubt
there
as
to
what
ought
to
be
done
and
even
then
the
difficulty
was
not
altogether
over
till
she
was
gone
neither
lady
ushant
nor
her
nephew
would
go
there
and
he
could
only
declare
his
purpose
of
attending
the
funeral
whether
he
were
asked
or
not
when
his
aunt
again
spoke
of
the
will
he
desired
her
with
much
emphasis
not
to
allude
to
the
subject
if
the
property
is
to
come
to
me
he
said
anything
of
good
that
may
be
in
it
can
not
be
much
sweeter
by
anticipation
and
if
it
is
not
i
shall
only
encourage
disappointment
by
thinking
of
it
but
it
would
be
such
a
shame
that
i
deny
altogether
it
was
his
own
to
do
as
he
liked
with
it
had
he
married
i
should
not
have
expected
it
because
i
am
the
heir
but
if
you
please
aunt
do
not
say
a
word
more
about
it
on
the
sunday
morning
he
heard
that
morton
was
gone
to
london
and
then
he
walked
over
to
bragton
he
found
that
she
had
locked
and
sealed
up
everything
with
so
much
precision
that
she
must
have
worked
hard
at
the
task
from
the
hour
of
his
death
almost
to
that
of
her
departure
she
never
rested
herself
all
day
said
hopkins
till
i
thought
she
would
sink
from
very
weariness
she
had
gone
into
every
room
and
opened
every
drawer
and
had
had
every
piece
of
plate
through
her
fingers
and
then
hopkins
told
him
that
just
as
she
was
departing
she
had
said
that
the
keys
would
be
given
to
the
lawyer
after
that
he
wandered
about
the
place
thinking
what
his
life
would
be
should
he
find
himself
the
owner
of
bragton
at
this
moment
he
almost
felt
that
he
disliked
the
place
though
there
had
been
times
in
which
he
had
thought
that
he
loved
it
too
well
of
one
thing
he
was
conscious
that
if
bragton
should
become
his
it
would
be
his
duty
to
live
there
he
must
move
his
books
and
pipes
and
other
household
gods
from
hoppet
hall
and
become
an
english
squire
would
it
be
too
late
for
him
to
learn
to
ride
to
hounds
would
it
be
possible
that
he
should
ever
succeed
in
shooting
a
pheasant
if
he
were
to
study
the
art
patiently
could
he
interest
himself
as
to
the
prevalence
or
decadence
of
ground
game
and
what
must
he
do
with
his
neighbours
of
course
he
would
have
to
entertain
mainwaring
and
the
other
parsons
and
perhaps
once
in
the
year
to
ask
lord
rufford
to
dine
with
him
if
lord
rufford
came
what
on
earth
would
he
say
to
him
and
then
there
arose
another
question
would
it
not
be
his
duty
to
marry
and
if
so
whom
he
had
been
distinctly
told
that
mary
masters
had
given
her
heart
to
some
one
and
he
certainly
was
not
the
man
to
ask
for
the
hand
of
a
girl
who
had
not
a
heart
to
give
and
yet
he
thought
that
it
would
be
impossible
that
he
should
marry
any
other
person
he
spent
hours
in
walking
about
the
grounds
looking
at
the
garden
and
belongings
which
would
so
probably
be
his
own
within
a
week
and
thinking
whether
it
would
be
possible
that
he
should
bring
a
mistress
to
preside
over
them
before
he
reached
home
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
only
one
mistress
would
be
possible
and
that
she
was
beyond
his
reach
on
the
tuesday
he
received
a
scrawl
from
hopkins
with
a
letter
from
the
lawyer
addressed
to
her
the
lawyer
wrote
to
say
that
he
would
be
down
on
wednesday
evening
would
attend
the
funeral
and
read
his
client
will
after
they
had
performed
the
ceremony
he
went
on
to
add
that
in
obedience
to
morton
directions
he
had
invited
peter
morton
to
be
present
on
the
occasion
on
the
wednesday
reginald
again
went
over
but
left
before
the
arrival
of
the
two
gentlemen
on
the
thursday
he
was
there
early
and
of
course
took
upon
himself
the
duty
of
chief
mourner
peter
morton
was
there
and
showed
in
a
bewildered
way
that
he
had
been
summoned
rather
to
the
opening
of
the
will
than
to
the
funeral
of
a
man
he
had
never
seen
then
the
will
was
read
there
were
only
two
names
mentioned
in
it
john
morton
left
and
his
watch
and
chain
and
rings
to
arabella
trefoil
and
everything
else
of
which
he
was
possessed
to
his
cousin
reginald
morton
upon
my
word
i
do
know
why
they
sent
for
me
said
the
other
cousin
peter
morton
seemed
to
think
that
you
would
like
to
pay
a
tribute
of
respect
said
the
lawyer
peter
looked
at
him
and
went
upstairs
and
packed
his
portmanteau
the
lawyer
handed
over
the
keys
to
the
new
squire
and
then
everything
was
done
chapter
xi
the
new
minister
poor
old
paragon
exclaimed
archibald
currie
as
he
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fire
among
his
colleagues
at
the
foreign
office
on
the
day
after
john
morton
death
poor
young
paragon
that
the
pity
of
it
said
mounser
green
i
do
suppose
he
was
turned
thirty
and
he
was
a
useful
man
a
very
useful
man
that
the
worst
of
it
he
was
just
one
of
those
men
that
the
country
ca
afford
to
lose
and
whom
it
is
so
very
hard
to
replace
mounser
green
was
always
eloquent
as
to
the
needs
of
the
public
service
and
did
really
in
his
heart
of
hearts
care
about
his
office
who
is
to
go
to
patagonia
i
sure
i
do
know
platitude
was
asking
me
about
it
and
i
told
him
that
i
could
name
a
man
old
platitude
always
thinks
that
the
world
is
coming
to
an
end
said
currie
there
are
as
good
fish
in
the
sea
as
ever
were
caught
who
is
there
monsoon
wo
go
even
if
they
ask
him
the
paragon
was
just
the
fellow
for
it
he
had
his
heart
in
the
work
an
immense
deal
depends
on
what
sort
of
man
we
have
in
patagonia
at
the
present
moment
if
paraguay
gets
the
better
of
the
patagonese
all
brazil
will
be
in
a
ferment
and
you
know
how
that
kind
of
thing
spreads
among
spaniards
and
portuguese
nobody
can
interfere
but
the
british
minister
when
i
suggested
morton
i
knew
i
had
the
right
man
if
he
only
take
it
and
now
he
has
gone
and
died
said
hoffmann
and
now
he
has
gone
and
died
continued
mounser
green
never
nursed
a
dear
gazelle
and
all
the
rest
of
it
poor
paragon
i
fear
he
was
a
little
cut
about
miss
trefoil
she
was
down
with
him
the
day
before
he
died
said
young
glossop
i
happen
to
know
that
it
was
before
he
thought
of
going
to
patagonia
that
she
was
at
bragton
said
currie
that
all
you
know
about
it
old
fellow
said
the
indignant
young
one
she
was
there
a
second
time
just
before
his
death
i
had
it
from
lady
penwether
who
was
in
the
neighbourhood
my
dear
little
boy
said
mounser
green
that
was
exactly
what
was
likely
to
happen
and
he
yet
may
have
broken
his
heart
i
have
seen
a
good
deal
of
the
lady
lately
and
under
no
circumstances
would
she
have
married
him
when
he
accepted
the
mission
that
at
any
rate
was
all
over
the
rufford
affair
had
begun
before
that
said
hoffmann
the
rufford
affair
as
you
call
it
said
glossop
was
no
affair
at
all
what
do
you
mean
by
that
asked
currie
i
mean
that
rufford
was
never
engaged
to
her
not
for
an
instant
said
the
lad
urgent
in
spreading
the
lesson
which
he
had
received
from
his
cousin
it
was
all
a
dead
who
was
taken
in
asked
mounser
green
well
nobody
was
taken
in
as
it
happened
but
i
suppose
there
be
a
doubt
that
she
tried
her
best
to
catch
him
and
that
the
duke
and
duchess
and
mistletoe
and
old
trefoil
all
backed
her
up
it
was
a
regular
plant
the
only
thing
is
it
did
come
off
look
here
young
shaver
this
was
mounser
green
again
when
you
speak
of
a
young
lady
do
you
be
a
little
more
discreet
but
did
she
do
it
green
that
more
than
you
or
i
can
tell
if
you
want
to
know
what
i
think
i
believe
he
paid
her
a
great
deal
of
attention
and
then
behaved
very
badly
to
her
he
did
behave
badly
at
all
said
young
glossop
my
dear
boy
when
you
are
as
old
as
i
am
you
will
have
learned
how
very
hard
it
is
to
know
everything
i
only
say
what
i
believe
and
perhaps
i
may
have
better
ground
for
believing
than
you
he
certainly
paid
her
a
great
deal
of
attention
and
then
her
friends
especially
the
duchess
went
to
work
they
wanted
to
get
her
off
their
hands
these
six
or
eight
years
said
currie
that
nonsense
again
continued
the
new
advocate
for
there
is
no
doubt
she
might
have
married
morton
all
the
time
had
she
pleased
yes
but
rufford
a
fellow
with
sixty
thousand
a
year
said
glossop
about
a
third
of
that
would
be
nearer
the
mark
glossy
take
my
word
for
it
you
do
know
everything
yet
though
you
have
so
many
advantages
after
that
mounser
green
retreated
to
his
own
room
with
a
look
and
tone
as
though
he
were
angry
what
makes
him
so
ferocious
about
it
asked
glossop
when
the
door
was
shut
you
are
always
putting
your
foot
in
it
said
currie
i
kept
on
winking
to
you
but
it
was
no
good
he
sees
her
almost
every
day
now
she
staying
with
old
green
in
portugal
street
there
has
been
some
break
up
between
her
and
her
mother
and
old
green
has
taken
her
in
there
some
sort
of
relationship
mounser
is
the
old
woman
nephew
and
she
is
aunt
by
marriage
to
the
connop
greens
down
in
hampshire
and
connop
green
is
first
cousin
to
lady
augustus
if
dick
sister
married
tom
brother
what
relation
would
dick
be
to
tom
mother
that
the
kind
of
thing
is
it
suggested
hoffmann
at
any
rate
there
she
is
and
mounser
sees
her
every
day
it
do
make
any
difference
about
rufford
said
young
glossop
stoutly
all
this
happened
before
the
will
had
been
declared
when
arabella
did
not
dream
that
she
was
an
heiress
a
day
or
two
afterwards
she
received
a
letter
from
the
lawyer
telling
her
of
her
good
fortune
and
informing
her
that
the
trinkets
would
be
given
up
to
her
and
the
money
paid
short
of
legacy
duty
whenever
she
would
fix
a
time
and
place
the
news
almost
stunned
her
there
was
a
moment
in
which
she
thought
that
she
was
bound
to
reject
this
money
as
she
had
rejected
that
tendered
to
her
by
the
other
man
poor
as
she
was
greedy
as
she
was
alive
as
she
was
to
the
necessity
of
doing
something
for
herself
still
this
legacy
was
to
her
at
first
bitter
rather
than
sweet
she
had
never
treated
any
man
so
ill
as
she
had
treated
this
man
and
it
was
thus
that
he
punished
her
she
was
alive
to
the
feeling
that
he
had
always
been
true
to
her
in
her
intercourse
with
other
men
there
had
been
generally
a
battle
carried
on
with
some
fairness
diamond
had
striven
to
cut
diamond
but
here
the
dishonesty
had
all
been
on
one
side
and
she
was
aware
that
it
had
been
so
in
her
later
affair
with
lord
rufford
she
really
did
think
that
she
had
been
ill
used
but
she
was
quite
alive
to
the
fact
that
her
treatment
of
john
morton
had
been
abominable
the
one
man
in
order
that
he
might
escape
without
further
trouble
had
in
the
grossest
manner
sent
to
her
the
offer
of
a
bribe
the
other
in
regard
to
whose
end
her
hard
heart
was
touched
even
her
conscience
seared
had
named
her
in
his
will
as
though
his
affection
was
unimpaired
of
course
she
took
the
money
but
she
took
it
with
inward
groans
she
took
the
money
and
the
trinkets
and
the
matter
was
all
arranged
for
her
by
mounser
green
so
after
all
the
paragon
left
her
whatever
he
could
leave
said
currie
in
the
same
room
at
the
foreign
office
a
week
had
passed
since
the
last
conversation
and
at
this
moment
mounser
green
was
not
in
the
room
oh
dear
no
said
young
glossy
she
does
have
bragton
that
goes
to
his
cousin
that
was
entailed
glossy
my
boy
not
a
bit
of
it
everybody
thought
he
would
leave
the
place
to
another
morton
a
fellow
he
never
seen
in
one
of
those
somerset
house
offices
he
and
this
fellow
who
is
to
have
it
were
enemies
but
he
would
put
it
out
of
the
right
line
it
all
very
well
for
mounser
to
be
down
on
me
but
i
do
happen
to
know
what
goes
on
in
that
country
she
gets
a
pot
of
money
and
no
end
of
family
jewels
but
he
did
leave
her
the
estate
as
he
might
have
done
at
that
moment
mounser
green
came
into
the
room
it
was
rather
later
than
usual
being
past
one
and
he
looked
as
though
he
were
flurried
he
did
speak
for
a
few
minutes
but
stood
before
the
fire
smoking
a
cigar
and
there
was
a
general
silence
there
being
now
a
feeling
among
them
that
arabella
trefoil
was
not
to
be
talked
about
in
the
old
way
before
mounser
green
at
last
he
spoke
himself
i
suppose
you
have
heard
who
is
to
go
to
patagonia
after
all
is
it
settled
asked
currie
anybody
we
know
asked
hoffmann
i
hope
it
no
d
outsider
said
the
too
energetic
glossop
it
is
settled
and
it
is
somebody
you
know
and
it
is
not
a
d
outsider
unless
indeed
he
may
be
considered
to
be
an
outsider
in
reference
to
that
branch
of
the
service
it
some
consul
said
currie
backstairs
from
panama
i
bet
a
crown
it
is
backstairs
it
is
a
consul
gentlemen
get
out
your
mounser
green
has
consented
to
be
expatriated
for
the
good
of
his
country
you
going
to
patagonia
said
currie
you
chaffing
said
glossop
i
never
was
so
shot
in
my
life
said
hoffmann
it
true
my
dear
boys
i
never
was
so
sorry
for
anything
in
all
my
born
days
said
glossop
almost
crying
why
on
earth
should
you
go
to
patagonia
patagonia
ejaculated
currie
what
will
you
do
in
patagonia
it
an
opening
my
dear
fellow
said
mounser
green
leaning
affectionately
on
glossop
shoulder
what
should
i
do
by
remaining
here
when
drummond
asked
me
i
saw
he
wanted
me
to
go
they
forget
that
kind
of
thing
at
that
moment
a
messenger
opened
the
door
and
the
senator
gotobed
almost
without
being
announced
entered
the
room
he
had
become
so
intimate
of
late
at
the
foreign
office
and
his
visits
were
so
frequent
that
he
was
almost
able
to
dispense
with
the
assistance
of
any
messenger
perhaps
mounser
green
and
his
colleagues
were
a
little
tired
of
him
but
yet
after
their
fashion
they
were
always
civil
to
him
and
remembered
as
they
were
bound
to
do
that
he
was
one
of
the
leading
politicians
of
a
great
nation
i
have
secured
the
hall
he
said
at
once
as
though
aware
that
no
news
could
be
so
important
as
the
news
he
thus
conveyed
have
you
indeed
said
currie
secured
it
for
the
fifteenth
now
the
question
is
what
do
you
think
said
glossop
interrupting
him
without
the
slightest
hesitation
mounser
green
is
going
to
patagonia
in
place
of
the
poor
paragon
i
beg
to
congratulate
green
with
all
my
heart
by
george
i
do
said
the
juvenile
clerk
fancy
congratulating
a
fellow
on
going
to
patagonia
it
what
i
call
an
awful
sell
for
everybody
but
as
i
was
saying
i
have
the
hall
for
the
fifteenth
you
mean
to
lecture
then
after
all
said
green
certainly
i
do
i
am
not
going
to
be
deterred
from
doing
my
duty
because
i
am
told
there
is
a
little
danger
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
i
can
depend
on
having
a
staff
of
policemen
of
course
there
will
be
police
said
green
but
i
mean
some
extra
strength
i
do
mind
for
myself
but
i
should
be
so
unhappy
if
there
were
anything
of
a
commotion
then
he
was
assured
that
the
officers
of
the
police
force
would
look
to
that
and
was
assured
also
that
mounser
green
and
the
other
gentlemen
in
the
room
would
certainly
attend
the
lecture
i
do
suppose
i
shall
be
gone
by
that
time
said
mounser
green
in
a
melancholy
tone
of
voice
chapter
xii
i
must
go
rufford
march
my
dear
miss
trefoil
i
am
indeed
sorry
that
i
should
have
offended
you
by
acceding
to
a
suggestion
which
i
think
i
may
say
originated
with
your
mother
when
she
told
me
that
her
circumstances
and
yours
were
not
in
a
pecuniary
point
of
view
so
comfortable
as
they
might
be
i
did
feel
that
it
was
in
my
power
to
alleviate
that
trouble
the
sum
of
money
mentioned
by
my
lawyer
was
certainly
named
by
your
mother
at
any
rate
pray
believe
that
i
meant
to
be
of
service
as
to
naming
a
place
where
we
might
meet
it
really
could
be
of
no
service
it
would
be
painful
to
both
of
us
and
could
have
no
good
result
again
apologizing
for
having
inadvertently
offended
you
by
adopting
the
views
which
lady
augustus
entertained
i
beg
to
assure
you
that
i
am
yours
faithfully
rufford
this
letter
came
from
the
peer
himself
without
assistance
after
his
interview
with
lady
augustus
he
simply
told
his
mentor
sir
george
that
he
had
steadfastly
denied
the
existence
of
any
engagement
not
daring
to
acquaint
him
with
the
offer
he
had
made
neither
therefore
could
he
tell
sir
george
of
the
manner
in
which
the
young
lady
had
repudiated
the
offer
that
she
should
have
repudiated
it
was
no
doubt
to
her
credit
as
he
thought
of
it
afterwards
he
felt
that
had
she
accepted
it
she
would
have
been
base
indeed
and
yet
as
he
thought
of
what
had
taken
place
at
the
house
in
piccadilly
he
was
confident
that
the
proposition
had
in
some
way
come
from
her
mother
no
doubt
he
had
first
written
a
sum
of
money
on
the
fragment
of
paper
which
she
had
preserved
and
the
evidence
would
so
far
go
against
him
but
lady
augustus
had
spoken
piteously
of
their
joint
poverty
and
had
done
so
in
lieu
of
insisting
with
a
indignation
on
her
daughter
rights
of
course
she
had
intended
to
ask
for
money
what
other
purpose
could
she
have
had
it
was
so
he
had
argued
at
the
moment
and
so
he
had
argued
since
if
it
were
so
he
would
not
admit
that
he
had
behaved
unlike
a
gentleman
in
offering
the
money
yet
he
did
not
dare
to
tell
sir
george
and
therefore
was
obliged
to
answer
arabella
letter
without
assistance
he
was
not
altogether
sorry
to
have
his
being
fully
as
much
alive
to
the
value
of
money
as
any
brother
peer
in
the
kingdom
but
he
would
sooner
have
paid
the
money
than
be
subject
to
an
additional
interview
he
had
been
forced
up
to
london
to
see
first
the
father
and
then
the
mother
and
thought
that
he
had
paid
penalty
enough
for
any
offence
that
he
might
have
committed
an
additional
interview
with
the
young
lady
herself
would
distress
him
beyond
anything
would
be
worse
than
any
other
interview
he
would
sooner
leave
rufford
and
go
abroad
than
encounter
it
he
promised
himself
that
nothing
should
induce
him
to
encounter
it
therefore
he
wrote
the
above
letter
arabella
when
she
received
it
had
ceased
to
care
very
much
about
the
insult
of
the
offer
she
had
then
quarrelled
with
her
mother
and
had
insisted
on
some
separation
even
without
any
arrangement
as
to
funds
requiring
some
confidant
she
had
told
a
great
deal
though
not
quite
all
to
connop
green
and
that
lady
had
passed
her
on
for
a
while
to
her
husband
aunt
in
london
at
this
time
she
had
heard
nothing
of
john
morton
will
and
had
perhaps
thought
with
some
tender
regret
of
the
munificence
of
her
other
lover
which
she
had
scorned
but
she
was
still
intent
on
doing
something
the
fury
of
her
despair
was
still
on
her
so
that
she
could
not
weigh
the
injury
she
might
do
herself
against
some
possible
gratification
to
her
wounded
spirit
up
to
this
moment
she
had
formed
no
future
hope
at
this
epoch
she
had
no
string
to
her
bow
john
morton
was
dead
and
she
had
absolutely
wept
for
him
in
solitude
though
she
had
certainly
never
loved
him
nor
did
she
love
lord
rufford
as
far
as
she
knew
how
to
define
her
feelings
she
thought
that
she
hated
him
but
she
told
herself
hourly
that
she
had
not
done
with
him
she
was
instigated
by
the
true
feminine
medea
feeling
that
she
would
find
some
way
to
wring
his
heart
even
though
in
the
process
she
might
suffer
twice
as
much
as
he
did
she
had
convinced
herself
that
in
this
instance
he
was
the
offender
painful
to
both
of
us
no
doubt
but
because
it
would
be
painful
to
him
it
should
be
exacted
though
he
was
a
coward
and
would
fain
shirk
such
pain
she
could
be
brave
enough
even
though
she
should
be
driven
to
catch
him
by
the
arm
in
the
open
street
she
would
have
it
out
with
him
he
was
a
liar
and
a
coward
and
she
would
at
any
rate
have
the
satisfaction
of
telling
him
so
she
thought
much
about
it
before
she
could
resolve
on
what
she
would
do
she
could
not
ask
old
green
to
help
her
green
was
a
kind
old
woman
who
had
lived
much
in
the
world
and
would
wish
to
see
much
of
it
still
had
age
allowed
her
arabella
trefoil
was
at
any
rate
the
niece
of
a
duke
and
the
duke
in
this
affair
with
lord
rufford
had
taken
his
niece
part
she
opened
her
house
and
as
much
of
her
heart
as
was
left
to
arabella
and
was
ready
to
mourn
with
her
over
the
wicked
lord
she
could
sympathise
with
her
too
as
to
the
iniquities
of
her
mother
whom
none
of
the
greens
loved
but
she
would
have
been
frightened
by
any
proposition
as
to
medean
vengeance
in
these
days
still
winter
days
and
not
open
to
much
feminine
gaiety
in
london
even
if
in
the
present
constitution
of
her
circumstances
gaiety
would
have
come
in
her
way
in
these
days
the
hours
in
her
life
which
interested
her
most
were
those
in
which
mounser
green
was
dutifully
respectful
to
his
aunt
patagonia
had
not
yet
presented
itself
to
him
some
four
or
five
hundred
a
year
which
the
old
lady
had
at
her
own
disposal
had
for
years
past
contributed
to
mounser
ideas
of
duty
and
now
arabella
presence
at
the
small
house
in
portugal
street
certainly
added
a
new
zest
to
those
ideas
the
niece
of
the
duke
of
mayfair
and
the
rejected
of
lord
rufford
was
at
the
present
moment
an
interesting
young
woman
in
mounser
green
world
there
were
many
who
thought
that
she
had
been
had
she
succeeded
all
the
world
would
have
pitied
lord
rufford
but
as
he
had
escaped
there
was
a
strong
party
for
the
lady
and
gradually
mounser
green
who
some
weeks
ago
had
not
thought
very
much
of
her
became
one
of
the
party
she
had
brought
her
maid
with
her
and
when
she
found
that
mounser
green
came
to
the
house
every
evening
either
before
or
after
dinner
she
had
recourse
to
her
accustomed
lures
she
would
sit
quiet
dejected
almost
in
the
corner
of
a
sofa
but
when
he
spoke
to
her
she
would
come
to
life
and
raise
her
eyes
not
ignoring
the
recognised
dejection
of
her
jilted
position
not
pretending
to
this
minor
stag
of
six
tines
that
she
was
a
sprightly
unwooed
young
fawn
fresh
out
of
the
forest
almost
asking
him
to
weep
with
her
and
playing
her
accustomed
lures
though
in
a
part
which
she
had
not
hitherto
filled
but
still
she
was
resolved
that
her
jason
should
not
as
yet
be
quit
of
his
medea
so
she
made
her
plot
she
would
herself
go
down
to
rufford
and
force
her
way
into
her
late
lover
presence
in
spite
of
all
obstacles
it
was
possible
that
she
should
do
this
and
get
back
to
london
the
same
day
but
to
do
so
she
must
leave
london
by
an
early
train
at
stay
seven
or
eight
hours
at
rufford
and
reach
the
london
station
at
for
such
a
journey
there
must
be
some
valid
excuse
made
to
green
there
must
be
some
necessity
shown
for
such
a
journey
she
would
declare
that
a
meeting
was
necessary
with
her
mother
and
that
her
mother
was
at
any
town
she
chose
to
name
at
the
requisite
distance
from
london
in
this
way
she
might
start
with
her
maid
before
daylight
and
get
back
after
dark
and
have
the
meeting
with
her
mother
or
with
lord
rufford
as
the
case
might
be
but
mounser
green
knew
very
well
that
lady
augustus
was
in
orchard
street
and
knew
also
that
arabella
was
determined
not
to
see
her
mother
and
if
she
declared
her
purpose
without
a
caution
to
mounser
green
the
old
woman
would
tell
her
nephew
and
the
nephew
would
unwittingly
expose
the
deceit
it
was
necessary
therefore
that
she
should
admit
mounser
green
to
at
any
rate
half
a
confidence
this
she
did
do
ask
me
any
questions
she
said
i
know
i
can
trust
you
i
must
be
out
of
town
the
whole
day
and
perhaps
the
next
and
your
aunt
must
not
know
why
i
am
going
or
where
you
will
help
me
of
course
he
said
that
he
would
help
her
and
the
lie
with
a
vast
accompaniment
of
little
lies
was
told
there
must
be
a
meeting
on
business
matters
between
her
and
her
mother
and
her
mother
was
now
in
the
neighbourhood
of
birmingham
this
was
the
lie
told
to
green
she
would
go
down
and
if
possible
be
back
on
the
same
day
she
would
take
her
maid
with
her
she
thought
that
in
such
a
matter
as
that
she
could
trust
her
maid
and
was
in
truth
afraid
to
travel
alone
i
will
come
in
the
morning
and
take
miss
trefoil
to
the
station
said
mounser
and
will
meet
her
in
the
evening
and
so
the
matter
was
arranged
the
journey
was
not
without
its
drawbacks
and
almost
its
perils
summer
or
winter
arabella
trefoil
was
seldom
out
of
bed
before
nine
it
was
incumbent
on
her
now
to
get
up
on
a
cold
march
morning
when
the
lion
had
not
as
yet
made
way
for
the
lamb
at
five
that
itself
seemed
to
be
all
but
impossible
to
her
nevertheless
she
was
ready
and
had
tried
to
swallow
half
a
cup
of
tea
when
mounser
green
came
to
the
door
with
a
cab
a
little
after
six
she
had
endeavoured
to
dispense
with
this
new
friend
attendance
but
he
had
insisted
assuring
her
that
without
some
such
aid
no
cab
would
be
forthcoming
she
had
not
told
him
and
did
not
intend
that
he
should
know
to
what
station
she
was
going
you
begged
me
to
ask
no
questions
he
said
when
he
was
in
the
cab
with
her
the
maid
having
been
induced
most
unwillingly
to
seat
herself
with
the
cabman
on
the
box
and
i
have
obeyed
you
but
i
wish
i
knew
how
i
could
help
you
you
have
helped
me
and
you
are
helping
me
but
do
not
ask
anything
more
will
you
be
angry
with
me
if
i
say
that
i
fear
you
are
intending
something
rash
of
course
i
am
how
could
it
be
otherwise
with
me
do
you
think
there
are
turns
in
a
person
life
when
she
must
do
something
rash
think
of
yourself
if
everybody
crushed
you
if
you
were
beyond
all
belief
if
the
very
people
who
ought
to
trust
you
doubted
you
would
you
turn
upon
somebody
and
rend
him
are
you
going
to
rend
anybody
i
do
not
know
as
yet
i
wish
you
would
let
me
go
down
with
you
no
that
you
certainly
can
not
you
must
not
come
even
into
the
station
with
me
you
have
been
very
good
to
me
you
will
not
now
turn
against
me
i
certainly
will
do
nothing
but
what
you
tell
me
then
here
we
are
and
now
you
must
go
jane
can
carry
my
and
cloak
if
you
choose
to
come
in
the
evening
at
ten
it
will
be
an
additional
favour
i
certainly
will
do
so
but
miss
trefoil
one
word
they
were
now
standing
under
cover
of
the
portico
in
front
of
the
railway
station
into
which
he
was
not
to
be
allowed
to
enter
what
i
fear
is
this
that
in
your
first
anger
you
may
be
tempted
to
do
something
which
may
be
injurious
to
to
your
prospects
in
life
i
have
no
prospects
in
life
mr
green
ah
that
is
just
it
there
are
for
most
of
us
moments
of
unhappiness
in
which
we
are
tempted
by
our
misery
to
think
that
we
are
relieved
at
any
rate
from
the
burden
of
caution
because
nothing
that
can
occur
to
us
can
make
us
worse
than
we
are
nothing
can
make
me
worse
than
i
am
but
in
a
few
months
or
weeks
continued
mounser
green
bringing
up
in
his
benevolence
all
the
wisdom
of
his
experience
we
have
got
a
new
footing
amidst
our
troubles
and
then
we
may
find
how
terrible
is
the
injury
which
our
own
indiscretion
has
brought
on
us
i
do
not
want
to
ask
any
questions
but
it
might
be
so
much
better
that
you
should
abandon
your
intention
and
go
back
with
me
she
seemed
to
be
almost
undecided
for
a
moment
as
she
thought
over
his
words
but
she
remembered
her
pledge
to
herself
that
lord
rufford
should
find
that
she
had
not
done
with
him
yet
i
must
go
she
said
in
a
hoarse
voice
if
you
must
i
must
go
i
have
no
way
out
of
it
green
i
can
not
tell
you
how
much
obliged
to
you
i
am
then
he
turned
back
and
she
went
into
the
station
and
took
two
tickets
for
rufford
at
that
moment
lord
rufford
was
turning
himself
comfortably
in
his
bed
how
would
he
have
sprung
up
and
how
would
he
have
fled
had
he
known
the
evil
that
was
coming
upon
him
this
happened
on
a
thursday
a
day
on
which
as
arabella
knew
the
did
not
go
out
the
very
thursday
on
which
john
morton
was
buried
and
the
will
was
read
at
bragton
she
was
fully
determined
to
speak
her
mind
to
the
man
and
to
be
checked
by
no
feminine
squeamishness
she
would
speak
her
mind
to
him
if
she
could
force
her
way
into
his
presence
and
in
doing
this
she
would
be
debarred
by
no
etiquette
it
might
be
that
she
would
fail
that
he
would
lack
the
courage
to
see
her
and
would
run
away
even
before
all
his
servants
when
he
should
hear
who
was
standing
in
his
hall
but
if
he
did
so
she
would
try
again
even
though
she
should
have
to
ride
out
into
the
after
him
face
to
face
she
would
tell
him
that
he
was
a
liar
and
a
slanderer
and
no
gentleman
though
she
should
have
to
run
round
the
world
to
catch
him
when
she
reached
rufford
she
went
to
the
town
and
ordered
breakfast
and
a
carriage
as
soon
as
she
had
eaten
the
meal
she
desired
the
driver
in
a
clear
voice
to
take
her
to
rufford
hall
was
her
maid
to
go
with
her
no
she
would
be
back
soon
and
her
maid
would
wait
there
till
she
had
returned
chapter
xiii
in
the
park
this
thing
that
she
was
doing
required
an
infinite
amount
of
pluck
of
that
sort
of
hardihood
which
we
may
not
quite
call
courage
but
which
in
a
world
well
provided
with
policemen
is
infinitely
more
useful
than
courage
lord
rufford
himself
was
endowed
with
all
the
ordinary
bravery
of
an
englishman
but
he
could
have
flown
as
soon
as
run
into
a
lion
den
as
arabella
was
doing
she
had
learned
that
lady
penwether
and
miss
penge
were
both
at
rufford
hall
and
understood
well
the
difficulty
there
would
be
in
explaining
her
conduct
should
she
find
herself
in
their
presence
and
there
were
all
the
servants
there
to
stare
at
her
and
the
probability
that
she
might
be
shown
to
the
door
and
told
that
no
one
there
would
speak
to
her
she
saw
it
all
before
her
and
knew
how
bitter
it
might
be
but
her
heart
was
big
enough
to
carry
her
through
it
she
was
dressed
very
simply
but
still
by
no
means
dowdily
in
a
black
silk
dress
and
though
she
wore
a
thick
veil
when
she
got
out
of
the
fly
and
rang
the
door
bell
she
had
been
at
some
pains
with
her
hair
before
she
left
the
inn
her
purpose
was
revenge
but
still
she
had
an
eye
to
the
possible
chance
the
chance
barely
possible
of
bringing
the
man
to
submit
when
the
door
was
opened
she
raised
her
veil
and
asked
for
lord
rufford
but
as
she
did
so
she
walked
on
through
the
broad
passage
which
led
from
the
front
door
into
a
wide
central
space
which
they
called
the
but
which
really
was
the
hall
of
the
house
this
she
did
as
a
manifesto
that
she
did
not
mean
to
leave
the
house
because
she
might
be
told
that
he
was
out
or
could
not
be
seen
or
that
he
was
engaged
it
was
then
nearly
one
and
no
doubt
he
would
be
there
for
luncheon
of
course
he
might
be
in
truth
away
from
home
but
she
must
do
her
best
to
judge
of
that
by
the
manner
the
man
knew
her
well
and
not
improbably
had
heard
something
of
his
master
danger
he
was
however
very
respectful
and
told
her
that
his
lordship
was
out
in
the
grounds
but
that
lady
penwether
was
in
the
then
a
sudden
thought
struck
her
and
she
asked
the
man
whether
he
would
show
her
in
what
part
of
the
grounds
she
might
find
lord
rufford
upon
that
he
took
her
to
the
front
door
and
pointing
across
the
park
to
a
belt
of
trees
showed
her
three
or
four
men
standing
round
some
piece
of
work
he
believed
he
said
that
one
of
those
men
was
his
lordship
she
bowed
her
thanks
and
was
descending
the
steps
on
her
way
to
join
the
group
when
whom
should
she
see
but
lady
penwether
coming
into
the
house
with
her
and
gloves
it
was
unfortunate
but
she
would
not
allow
herself
to
be
stopped
by
lady
penwether
she
bowed
stiffly
and
would
have
passed
on
without
a
word
but
that
was
impossible
miss
trefoil
said
lady
penwether
with
astonishment
your
brother
is
just
across
the
park
i
think
i
see
him
and
will
go
to
him
i
had
better
send
and
tell
him
that
you
are
here
said
her
ladyship
i
need
not
trouble
you
so
far
i
can
be
my
own
messenger
perhaps
you
will
allow
the
fly
to
be
sent
round
to
the
yard
for
as
she
said
this
she
was
still
passing
down
the
steps
but
lady
penwether
knew
that
it
behoved
her
to
prevent
this
if
it
might
be
possible
of
late
she
had
had
little
or
no
conversation
with
her
brother
about
miss
trefoil
but
she
had
heard
much
from
her
husband
she
would
be
justified
she
thought
in
saying
or
in
doing
almost
anything
which
would
save
him
from
such
an
encounter
i
really
think
she
said
that
he
had
better
be
told
that
you
are
here
and
as
she
spoke
she
strove
to
put
herself
in
the
way
you
had
better
come
in
miss
trefoil
and
he
shall
be
informed
at
once
by
no
means
lady
penwether
i
would
not
for
worlds
give
him
or
you
so
much
trouble
i
see
him
and
i
will
go
to
him
then
lady
penwether
absolutely
put
out
her
hand
to
detain
her
but
arabella
shook
it
off
angrily
and
looked
into
the
other
woman
face
with
fierce
eyes
allow
me
she
said
to
conduct
myself
at
this
moment
as
i
may
think
best
i
shall
do
so
at
any
rate
then
she
stalked
on
and
lady
penwether
saw
that
any
contest
was
hopeless
had
she
sent
the
servant
on
with
all
his
speed
so
as
to
gain
three
or
four
moments
her
brother
could
hardly
have
fled
through
the
trees
in
face
of
the
enemy
lord
rufford
who
was
busy
planning
the
prolongation
of
a
fence
saw
nothing
of
all
this
but
after
a
while
he
was
aware
that
a
woman
was
coming
to
him
and
then
gradually
he
saw
who
that
woman
was
arabella
when
she
had
found
herself
advancing
closer
went
slowly
enough
she
was
sure
of
her
prey
now
and
was
wisely
mindful
that
it
might
be
well
that
she
should
husband
her
breath
the
nearer
she
drew
to
him
the
slower
became
her
pace
and
more
majestic
her
veil
was
well
thrown
back
and
her
head
was
raised
in
the
air
she
knew
these
little
tricks
of
deportment
and
could
carry
herself
like
a
queen
he
had
taken
a
moment
or
two
to
consider
should
he
fly
it
was
possible
he
might
vault
over
a
railed
fence
in
among
the
trees
at
a
spot
not
ten
yards
from
her
and
then
it
would
be
impossible
that
she
should
run
him
down
he
might
have
done
it
had
not
the
men
been
there
to
see
it
as
it
was
he
left
them
in
the
other
direction
and
came
forward
to
meet
her
he
tried
to
smile
pleasantly
as
he
spoke
to
her
so
i
see
that
you
would
not
take
my
advice
he
said
neither
your
advice
nor
your
money
my
lord
ah
i
was
so
sorry
about
that
but
indeed
indeed
the
fault
was
not
mine
they
were
your
figures
that
i
saw
upon
the
paper
and
by
your
orders
no
doubt
that
the
lawyer
acted
but
i
have
not
come
to
say
much
of
that
you
meant
i
suppose
to
be
gracious
i
meant
to
be
goodnatured
i
daresay
you
were
willing
enough
to
give
away
what
you
did
not
want
but
there
must
be
more
between
us
than
any
question
of
money
lord
rufford
you
have
treated
me
most
shamefully
i
hope
not
i
think
not
and
you
yourself
must
be
well
aware
of
it
quite
as
well
aware
of
it
as
i
am
you
have
thrown
me
over
and
absolutely
destroyed
me
and
why
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
because
you
have
been
afraid
of
others
because
your
sister
has
told
you
that
you
were
mistaken
in
your
choice
the
women
around
you
have
been
too
many
for
you
and
have
not
allowed
you
to
dispose
of
your
hand
and
your
name
and
your
property
as
you
pleased
i
defy
you
to
say
that
this
was
not
your
sister
doing
he
was
too
much
astounded
to
contradict
her
rapidly
and
then
she
passed
on
not
choosing
to
give
him
time
for
contradiction
will
you
have
the
hardihood
to
say
that
you
did
not
love
me
then
she
paused
thinking
that
he
would
not
dare
to
contradict
her
then
feeling
that
in
that
she
was
on
strong
ground
were
you
lying
when
you
told
me
that
you
did
what
did
you
mean
when
i
was
in
your
arms
up
in
the
house
there
what
did
you
intend
me
to
think
that
you
meant
then
she
stopped
standing
well
in
front
of
him
and
looking
fixedly
into
his
face
this
was
the
very
thing
that
he
had
feared
lord
augustus
had
been
a
trouble
the
duke
letter
had
been
a
trouble
lady
augustus
had
been
a
trouble
and
sir
george
sermons
had
been
troublesome
but
what
were
they
all
when
compared
to
this
how
is
it
possible
that
a
man
should
tell
a
girl
that
he
has
not
loved
her
when
he
has
embraced
her
again
and
again
he
may
know
it
and
she
may
know
it
and
each
may
know
that
the
other
knows
it
but
to
say
that
he
does
not
and
did
not
then
love
her
is
beyond
the
scope
of
his
audacity
unless
he
be
a
heartless
nero
no
one
can
grieve
about
this
so
much
as
i
do
he
said
weakly
can
not
i
grieve
more
do
you
think
i
who
told
all
my
relatives
that
i
was
to
become
your
wife
and
was
justified
in
so
telling
them
was
i
not
justified
i
think
not
you
think
not
what
did
you
mean
then
what
were
you
thinking
of
when
we
were
coming
back
in
the
carriage
from
stamford
when
with
your
arms
round
me
you
swore
that
you
loved
me
better
than
all
the
world
is
that
true
did
you
so
swear
what
a
question
for
a
man
to
have
to
answer
it
was
becoming
clear
to
him
that
there
was
nothing
for
him
but
to
endure
and
be
silent
even
to
this
interview
the
gods
would
at
last
give
an
end
the
hour
would
pass
though
alas
so
slowly
and
she
could
not
expect
that
he
should
stand
there
to
be
rated
much
after
the
accustomed
time
for
feeding
you
acknowledge
that
and
do
you
dare
to
say
that
i
had
no
right
to
tell
my
friends
there
was
a
moment
in
which
he
thought
it
was
almost
a
pity
that
he
had
not
married
her
she
was
very
beautiful
in
her
present
form
more
beautiful
he
thought
than
ever
she
was
the
niece
of
a
duke
and
certainly
a
very
clever
woman
he
had
not
wanted
money
and
why
should
he
have
married
her
as
for
hunting
him
that
was
a
matter
of
course
he
was
as
much
born
and
bred
to
be
hunted
as
a
fox
he
could
not
do
it
now
as
he
had
put
too
much
power
into
the
hands
of
the
penwethers
but
he
almost
wished
that
he
had
i
never
intended
it
he
said
what
did
you
intend
after
what
has
occurred
i
suppose
i
have
a
right
to
ask
such
a
question
i
have
made
a
somewhat
unpleasant
journey
all
alone
on
purpose
to
ask
that
question
what
did
you
intend
in
his
great
annoyance
he
struck
his
shovel
angrily
against
the
ground
and
i
will
not
leave
you
till
i
get
an
answer
to
the
question
what
did
you
intend
lord
rufford
there
was
nothing
for
him
but
silence
and
a
gradual
progress
back
towards
the
house
but
from
the
latter
resource
she
cut
him
off
for
a
time
you
will
do
me
the
favour
to
remain
with
me
here
till
this
conversation
is
ended
you
can
not
refuse
me
so
slight
a
request
as
that
seeing
the
trouble
to
which
you
have
put
me
i
never
saw
a
man
so
forgetful
of
words
you
can
not
speak
have
you
no
excuse
to
offer
not
a
word
to
say
in
explanation
of
conduct
so
black
that
i
do
think
here
in
england
i
ever
heard
a
case
to
equal
it
if
your
sister
had
been
treated
so
it
would
have
been
impossible
i
believe
it
her
cautious
nature
would
have
trusted
no
man
as
i
trusted
you
her
lips
doubtless
were
never
unfrozen
till
the
settlements
had
been
signed
with
her
it
was
a
matter
of
bargain
not
of
love
i
can
well
believe
that
i
will
not
talk
about
my
sister
it
seems
to
me
lord
rufford
that
you
object
to
talk
about
anything
you
certainly
have
been
very
uncommunicative
with
reference
to
yourself
were
you
lying
when
you
told
me
that
you
loved
me
no
did
i
lie
when
i
told
the
duchess
that
you
had
promised
me
your
love
did
i
lie
when
i
told
my
mother
that
in
these
days
a
man
does
not
always
mention
marriage
when
he
asks
a
girl
to
be
his
wife
you
said
you
loved
me
and
i
believed
you
and
the
rest
was
a
thing
of
course
and
you
meant
it
you
know
you
meant
it
when
you
held
me
in
your
arms
in
the
carriage
you
know
you
meant
me
to
suppose
that
it
would
always
be
so
then
the
fear
of
your
sister
came
upon
you
and
of
your
sister
husband
and
you
ran
away
i
wonder
whether
you
think
yourself
a
man
and
yet
she
felt
that
she
had
not
hit
him
yet
he
was
wretched
enough
and
she
could
see
that
he
was
wretched
but
the
wretchedness
would
pass
away
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
how
could
she
stab
him
so
that
the
wound
would
remain
with
what
virus
could
she
poison
her
arrow
so
that
the
agony
might
be
prolonged
and
such
a
coward
too
i
began
to
suspect
it
when
you
started
that
night
from
mistletoe
though
i
did
not
think
then
that
you
could
be
all
mean
all
cowardly
from
that
day
to
this
you
have
not
dared
to
speak
a
word
of
truth
every
word
has
been
a
falsehood
by
heavens
no
every
word
a
falsehood
and
i
a
lady
a
lady
whom
you
have
so
deeply
injured
whose
cruel
injury
even
you
have
not
the
face
to
deny
am
forced
by
your
cowardice
to
come
to
you
here
because
you
have
not
dared
to
come
out
to
meet
me
is
that
true
what
good
can
it
do
none
to
me
god
knows
you
are
such
a
thing
that
i
would
not
have
you
now
i
know
you
though
you
were
twice
lord
rufford
but
i
have
chosen
to
speak
my
mind
to
you
and
to
tell
you
what
i
think
did
you
suppose
that
when
i
said
i
would
meet
you
face
to
face
i
was
to
be
deterred
by
such
girl
excuses
as
you
made
i
chose
to
tell
you
to
your
face
that
you
are
false
a
coward
and
no
gentleman
and
though
you
had
hidden
yourself
under
the
very
earth
i
would
have
found
you
then
she
turned
round
and
saw
sir
george
penwether
standing
close
to
them
lord
rufford
had
seen
him
approaching
for
some
time
and
had
made
one
or
two
futile
attempts
to
meet
him
arabella
back
had
been
turned
to
the
house
and
she
had
not
heard
the
steps
or
observed
the
direction
of
her
companion
eyes
he
came
so
near
before
he
was
seen
that
he
heard
her
concluding
words
then
lord
rufford
with
a
ghastly
attempt
at
pleasantry
introduced
them
george
he
said
i
do
not
think
you
know
miss
trefoil
sir
george
penwether
miss
trefoil
the
interview
had
been
watched
from
the
house
and
the
husband
had
been
sent
down
by
his
wife
to
mitigate
the
purgatory
which
she
knew
that
her
brother
must
be
enduring
my
wife
said
sir
george
has
sent
me
to
ask
miss
trefoil
whether
she
will
not
come
into
lunch
i
believe
it
is
lord
rufford
house
said
arabella
if
miss
trefoil
frame
of
mind
will
allow
her
to
sit
at
table
with
me
i
shall
be
proud
to
see
her
said
lord
rufford
miss
trefoil
frame
of
mind
will
not
allow
her
to
eat
or
to
drink
with
such
a
dastard
said
she
turning
away
in
the
direction
of
the
park
gates
perhaps
sir
george
you
will
be
kind
enough
to
direct
the
man
who
brought
me
here
to
pick
me
up
at
the
lodge
and
so
she
walked
away
a
mile
across
the
park
neither
of
them
caring
to
follow
her
it
seemed
to
her
as
she
stood
at
the
lodge
gate
having
obstinately
refused
to
enter
the
house
to
be
an
eternity
before
the
fly
came
to
her
when
it
did
come
she
felt
as
though
her
strength
would
barely
enable
her
to
climb
into
it
and
when
she
was
there
she
wept
with
bitter
throbbing
woe
all
the
way
to
rufford
it
was
over
now
at
any
rate
now
there
was
not
a
possible
chance
on
which
a
gleam
of
hope
might
be
made
to
settle
and
how
handsome
he
was
and
how
beautiful
the
place
and
how
perfect
would
have
been
the
triumph
could
she
have
achieved
it
one
more
word
one
other
pressure
of
the
hand
in
the
might
have
done
it
had
he
really
promised
her
marriage
she
did
not
even
now
think
that
he
would
have
gone
back
from
his
word
if
that
heavy
stupid
duke
would
have
spoken
to
him
that
night
at
mistletoe
all
would
have
been
well
but
now
now
there
was
nothing
for
her
but
weeping
and
gnashing
of
teeth
he
was
gone
and
poor
morton
was
gone
and
all
those
others
whose
memories
rose
like
ghosts
before
her
they
were
all
gone
and
she
wept
as
she
thought
that
she
might
perhaps
have
made
a
better
use
of
the
gifts
which
providence
had
put
in
her
way
when
mounser
green
met
her
at
the
station
she
was
beyond
measure
weary
through
the
whole
journey
she
had
been
struggling
to
restrain
her
sobs
so
that
her
maid
should
neither
hear
nor
see
them
mind
me
green
i
am
only
tired
so
tired
she
said
as
she
got
into
the
carriage
which
he
had
brought
he
had
with
him
a
long
letter
addressed
to
herself
but
she
was
too
weary
to
open
it
that
night
it
was
the
letter
conveying
the
tidings
of
the
legacy
which
morton
had
made
in
her
favour
chapter
xiv
lord
rufford
model
farm
at
this
time
senator
gotobed
was
paying
a
second
visit
to
rufford
hall
in
the
matter
of
goarly
and
scrobby
he
had
never
given
way
an
inch
he
was
still
strongly
of
opinion
that
a
gentleman
pheasants
had
no
right
to
eat
his
neighbour
corn
and
that
if
damage
were
admitted
the
person
committing
the
injury
should
not
take
upon
himself
to
assess
the
damage
he
also
thought
and
very
often
declared
his
thoughts
that
goarly
was
justified
in
shooting
not
only
foxes
but
hounds
also
when
they
came
upon
his
property
and
in
moments
of
excitement
had
gone
so
far
as
to
say
that
not
even
horses
should
be
held
sacred
he
had
however
lately
been
driven
to
admit
that
goarly
himself
was
not
all
that
a
man
should
be
and
that
goarly
goose
was
an
impostor
it
was
the
theory
the
principle
for
which
he
combated
declaring
that
the
evil
condition
of
the
man
himself
was
due
to
the
evil
institutions
among
which
he
had
been
reared
by
degrees
evidence
had
been
obtained
of
scrobby
guilt
in
the
matter
of
the
red
herrings
and
he
was
to
be
tried
for
the
offence
of
putting
down
poison
goarly
was
to
be
the
principal
witness
against
his
brother
conspirator
lord
rufford
instigated
by
his
and
liking
the
spirit
of
the
man
had
invited
the
senator
to
stay
at
the
hall
while
the
case
was
being
tried
at
the
rufford
quarter
sessions
i
am
afraid
the
invitation
was
given
in
a
spirit
of
triumph
over
the
senator
rather
than
with
genuine
hospitality
it
was
thought
well
that
the
american
should
be
made
to
see
in
public
the
degradation
of
the
abject
creature
with
whom
he
had
sympathised
perhaps
there
were
some
who
thought
that
in
this
way
they
would
get
the
senator
neck
under
their
heels
if
there
were
such
they
were
likely
to
be
mistaken
as
the
senator
was
not
a
man
prone
to
submit
himself
to
such
treatment
he
was
seated
at
table
with
lady
penwether
and
miss
penge
when
lord
rufford
and
his
came
into
the
room
after
parting
with
miss
trefoil
in
the
manner
described
in
the
last
chapter
lady
penwether
had
watched
their
unwelcome
visitor
as
she
took
her
way
across
the
park
and
had
whispered
something
to
miss
penge
miss
penge
understood
the
matter
thoroughly
and
would
not
herself
have
made
the
slightest
allusion
to
the
other
young
lady
had
the
senator
not
been
there
the
two
gentlemen
would
have
been
allowed
to
take
their
places
without
a
word
on
the
subject
but
the
senator
had
a
marvellous
gift
of
saying
awkward
things
and
would
never
be
reticent
he
stood
for
a
while
at
the
window
in
the
before
he
went
across
the
hall
and
even
took
up
a
pair
of
to
scrutinise
the
lady
and
when
they
were
all
present
he
asked
whether
that
was
not
miss
trefoil
whom
he
had
seen
down
by
the
new
fence
lady
penwether
without
seeming
to
look
about
her
did
look
about
her
for
a
few
seconds
to
see
whether
the
question
might
be
allowed
to
die
away
unanswered
she
perceived
from
the
senator
face
that
he
intended
to
have
an
answer
yes
she
said
that
was
miss
trefoil
i
am
very
glad
that
she
is
not
coming
in
to
disturb
us
a
great
blessing
said
miss
penge
where
is
she
staying
asked
the
senator
i
think
she
drove
over
from
rufford
said
the
elder
lady
poor
young
lady
she
was
engaged
to
marry
my
friend
john
morton
she
must
have
felt
his
death
very
bitterly
he
was
an
excellent
young
man
rather
opinionated
and
perhaps
too
much
wedded
to
the
traditions
of
his
own
country
but
nevertheless
a
painstaking
excellent
young
man
i
had
hoped
to
welcome
her
as
morton
in
america
he
was
to
have
gone
to
patagonia
said
lord
rufford
endeavouring
to
come
to
himself
after
the
sufferings
of
the
morning
we
should
have
seen
him
back
in
washington
sir
whenever
you
have
anything
good
in
diplomacy
you
generally
send
him
to
us
poor
young
lady
was
she
talking
about
him
not
particularly
said
his
lordship
she
must
have
remembered
that
when
she
was
last
here
he
was
of
the
party
and
it
was
but
a
few
weeks
ago
only
a
little
before
christmas
he
struck
me
as
being
cold
in
his
manner
as
an
affianced
lover
was
not
that
your
idea
lady
penwether
i
do
think
i
observed
him
especially
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
he
was
much
attached
to
her
she
could
be
sprightly
enough
but
at
times
there
seemed
to
come
a
cold
melancholy
upon
her
too
it
is
i
fancy
so
with
most
of
your
english
ladies
miss
trefoil
always
gave
me
the
idea
of
being
a
good
type
of
the
english
aristocracy
lady
penwether
and
miss
penge
drew
themselves
up
very
stiffly
you
admired
her
i
think
my
lord
very
much
indeed
said
lord
rufford
filling
his
mouth
with
as
he
spoke
and
not
lifting
his
eyes
from
his
plate
will
she
be
back
to
dinner
oh
dear
no
said
lady
penwether
there
was
something
in
her
tone
which
at
last
startled
the
senator
into
perceiving
that
miss
trefoil
was
not
popular
at
rufford
hall
she
only
came
for
a
morning
call
said
lord
rufford
poor
young
woman
she
has
lost
her
husband
and
i
am
afraid
now
has
lost
her
friends
also
i
am
told
that
she
is
not
well
off
and
from
what
i
see
and
hear
i
fancy
that
here
in
england
a
young
lady
without
a
dowry
can
not
easily
replace
a
lover
i
suppose
too
miss
trefoil
is
not
quite
in
her
first
youth
if
you
have
done
caroline
said
lady
penwether
to
miss
penge
i
think
we
go
into
the
other
room
that
afternoon
sir
george
asked
the
senator
to
accompany
him
for
a
walk
sir
george
was
held
to
be
responsible
for
the
presence
and
was
told
by
the
ladies
that
he
must
do
something
with
him
the
next
day
which
was
friday
would
be
occupied
by
the
affairs
of
scrobby
and
goarly
and
on
the
saturday
he
was
to
return
to
town
the
two
started
about
three
with
the
object
of
walking
round
the
park
and
the
home
farm
the
senator
intent
on
his
duty
of
examining
the
ways
of
english
life
to
the
very
bottom
i
hope
i
did
not
say
anything
amiss
about
miss
trefoil
he
remarked
as
they
passed
through
a
shrubbery
gate
into
the
park
no
i
think
not
i
thought
your
good
lady
looked
as
though
she
did
not
like
the
subject
i
am
not
sure
that
miss
trefoil
is
very
popular
with
the
ladies
up
there
she
a
handsome
young
woman
and
clever
though
as
i
said
before
given
to
melancholy
and
sometimes
fastidious
when
we
were
all
here
i
thought
that
lord
rufford
admired
her
and
that
poor
morton
was
a
little
jealous
i
was
at
rufford
then
here
we
get
out
of
the
park
on
to
the
home
farm
rufford
does
it
very
well
very
well
indeed
looks
after
it
altogether
himself
i
can
not
quite
say
that
he
has
a
who
lives
in
the
house
there
with
a
salary
oh
yes
a
year
i
think
the
man
has
and
that
house
asked
the
senator
why
the
house
and
garden
are
worth
a
year
i
dare
say
they
are
of
course
it
costs
money
it
near
the
park
and
had
to
be
made
ornamental
and
does
it
pay
well
no
i
should
think
not
in
point
of
fact
i
know
it
does
not
he
loses
about
the
value
of
the
ground
the
senator
asked
a
great
many
more
questions
and
then
began
his
lecture
a
man
who
goes
into
trade
and
loses
by
it
can
not
be
doing
good
to
himself
or
to
others
you
say
sir
george
that
it
is
a
model
farm
but
it
a
model
of
ruin
if
you
want
to
teach
a
man
any
other
business
you
do
specially
select
an
example
in
which
the
proprietors
are
spending
all
their
capital
without
any
return
and
if
you
would
not
do
this
in
shoemaking
why
in
farming
the
neighbours
are
able
to
see
how
work
should
be
done
excuse
me
sir
george
but
it
seems
to
me
that
they
are
enabled
to
see
how
work
should
not
be
done
if
his
lordship
would
stick
up
over
his
gate
a
notice
to
the
effect
that
everything
seen
there
was
to
be
avoided
he
might
do
some
service
if
he
would
publish
his
accounts
in
the
village
newspaper
there
is
a
village
newspaper
in
the
there
is
a
and
rufford
is
much
more
than
a
village
if
he
would
publish
his
accounts
in
the
honestly
showing
how
much
he
had
lost
by
his
system
how
much
capital
had
been
misapplied
and
how
much
labour
wasted
he
might
serve
as
an
example
like
the
pictures
of
idle
apprentice
i
do
see
that
he
can
do
any
other
good
unless
it
be
to
the
estimable
gentleman
who
is
allowed
to
occupy
the
pretty
house
i
do
think
you
see
anything
like
that
model
farm
in
our
country
sir
your
views
gotobed
are
utilitarian
rather
than
picturesque
oh
if
you
say
that
it
is
done
for
the
picturesque
that
is
another
thing
lord
rufford
is
a
wealthy
lord
and
can
afford
to
be
picturesque
a
green
sward
i
should
have
thought
handsomer
as
well
as
less
expensive
than
a
ploughed
field
but
that
is
a
matter
of
taste
only
why
call
a
pretty
toy
a
model
farm
you
might
mislead
the
british
rustics
they
had
by
this
time
passed
through
a
couple
of
fields
which
formed
part
of
the
model
farm
and
had
come
to
a
stile
leading
into
a
large
meadow
this
i
take
it
said
the
senator
looking
about
him
is
beyond
the
limits
of
my
lord
plaything
this
is
shugborough
said
sir
george
and
there
is
john
runce
the
occupier
on
his
pony
he
at
any
rate
is
a
model
farmer
as
he
spoke
runce
slowly
trotted
up
to
them
touching
his
hat
and
gotobed
recognized
the
man
who
had
declined
to
sit
next
to
him
at
the
hunting
breakfast
runce
also
thought
that
he
knew
the
gentleman
do
you
hunt
mr
runce
asked
sir
george
well
sir
george
no
i
think
not
i
i
must
go
to
rufford
and
hear
that
fellow
scrobby
get
it
hot
and
heavy
we
seem
all
to
be
going
that
way
you
think
he
be
convicted
sir
if
there
a
juryman
left
in
the
country
worth
his
salt
he
be
convicted
said
runce
almost
enraged
at
the
doubt
but
that
other
fellow
he
to
get
off
that
what
kills
me
sir
george
you
alluding
to
goarly
sir
said
the
senator
that
about
it
certainly
said
runce
still
looking
very
suspiciously
at
his
companion
i
almost
think
he
is
the
bigger
rogue
of
the
two
said
the
senator
well
said
runce
well
i
do
know
as
he
ai
six
of
one
and
half
a
dozen
of
the
other
that
about
it
but
he
was
evidently
pacified
by
the
opinion
goarly
is
certainly
a
rascal
all
round
continued
the
senator
runce
looked
at
him
to
make
sure
whether
he
was
the
man
who
had
uttered
such
fearful
blasphemies
at
the
i
think
we
had
a
little
discussion
about
this
before
mr
runce
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
have
changed
your
principles
sir
not
a
bit
of
it
i
am
too
old
to
change
my
principles
runce
and
much
as
i
admire
this
country
i
do
think
it
the
place
in
which
i
should
be
induced
to
do
so
runce
looked
at
him
again
with
a
scowl
on
his
face
and
with
a
falling
mouth
goarly
is
certainly
a
blackguard
well
i
rather
think
he
is
but
a
blackguard
may
have
a
good
cause
put
it
in
your
own
case
runce
if
his
lordship
pheasants
ate
up
your
wheat
they
welcome
they
welcome
the
more
the
merrier
but
they
do
pheasants
know
when
they
well
off
or
if
a
crowd
of
horsemen
rode
over
your
fences
do
you
think
my
fences
they
be
welcome
in
my
wife
bedroom
if
the
fox
took
that
way
my
fences
it
what
i
has
fences
for
to
be
ridden
over
you
did
exactly
hear
what
i
have
to
say
mr
runce
and
i
do
want
no
offence
sir
if
you
be
a
friend
of
my
lord
but
if
his
lordship
was
to
say
hisself
that
goarly
was
right
i
would
listen
to
him
a
good
cause
and
he
going
about
at
dead
with
his
pockets
full
of
hounds
and
foxes
all
one
or
little
childer
either
for
the
matter
o
that
if
they
happened
on
the
herrings
i
have
not
said
his
cause
was
good
mr
runce
i
wish
you
good
evening
sir
george
said
the
farmer
reining
his
pony
round
good
evening
to
you
sir
and
runce
trotted
or
rather
ambled
off
unable
to
endure
another
word
an
honest
man
i
dare
say
said
the
senator
certainly
and
not
a
bad
specimen
of
a
british
farmer
not
a
bad
specimen
of
a
briton
generally
but
still
perhaps
a
little
unreasonable
after
that
sir
george
said
as
little
as
he
could
till
he
had
brought
the
senator
back
to
the
hall
i
think
it
all
over
now
said
lady
penwether
to
miss
penge
when
the
gentlemen
had
left
them
alone
in
the
afternoon
i
sure
i
hope
so
for
his
sake
what
a
woman
to
come
here
by
herself
in
that
way
i
do
think
he
ever
cared
for
her
in
the
least
i
ca
say
that
i
have
troubled
myself
much
about
that
replied
miss
penge
for
the
sake
of
the
family
generally
and
the
property
and
all
that
i
should
be
very
very
sorry
to
think
that
he
was
going
to
make
her
lady
rufford
i
dare
say
he
has
amused
himself
with
her
there
was
very
little
of
that
as
far
as
i
can
learn
very
little
encouragement
indeed
what
we
saw
here
was
the
worst
of
it
he
was
hardly
with
her
at
all
at
mistletoe
i
hope
it
will
make
him
more
cautious
that
all
said
miss
penge
miss
penge
was
now
a
great
heiress
having
had
her
lawsuit
respecting
certain
shares
in
a
welsh
settled
since
we
last
saw
her
as
all
the
world
knows
she
came
from
one
of
the
oldest
commoner
families
in
the
west
of
england
and
is
moreover
a
handsome
young
woman
only
years
of
age
lady
penwether
thinks
that
she
is
the
very
woman
to
be
mistress
of
rufford
and
i
do
not
know
that
miss
penge
herself
is
averse
to
the
idea
lord
rufford
has
been
too
lately
wounded
to
rise
at
the
bait
quite
immediately
but
his
sister
knows
that
her
brother
is
impressionable
and
that
a
little
patience
will
go
a
long
way
they
have
however
all
agreed
at
the
hall
that
arabella
name
shall
not
again
be
mentioned
chapter
xv
scrobby
trial
rufford
was
a
good
deal
moved
as
to
the
trial
of
scrobby
scrobby
was
a
man
who
not
long
since
had
held
his
head
up
in
rufford
and
had
the
reputation
of
a
tradesman
enemies
had
perhaps
doubted
his
probity
but
he
had
gone
on
and
prospered
and
two
or
three
years
before
the
events
which
are
now
chronicled
had
retired
on
a
competence
he
had
then
taken
a
house
with
a
few
acres
of
land
lying
between
rufford
and
rufford
hall
the
property
of
lord
rufford
and
had
commenced
genteel
life
many
in
the
neighbourhood
had
been
astonished
that
such
a
man
should
have
been
accepted
as
a
tenant
in
such
a
house
and
it
was
generally
understood
that
lord
rufford
himself
had
been
very
angry
with
his
agent
scrobby
did
not
prosper
greatly
in
his
new
career
he
became
a
guardian
of
the
poor
and
quarrelled
with
all
the
board
he
tried
to
become
a
municipal
counsellor
in
the
borough
but
failed
then
he
quarrelled
with
his
landlord
insisted
on
making
changes
in
the
grounds
which
were
not
authorised
by
the
terms
of
his
holding
would
not
pay
his
rent
and
was
at
last
ejected
having
caused
some
considerable
amount
of
trouble
then
he
occupied
a
portion
of
his
leisure
with
spreading
calumnies
as
to
his
lordship
and
was
generally
understood
to
have
made
up
his
mind
to
be
disagreeable
as
lord
rufford
was
a
sportsman
rather
than
anything
else
scrobby
studied
how
he
might
best
give
annoyance
in
that
direction
and
some
time
before
the
goarly
affair
had
succeeded
in
creating
considerable
disturbance
when
a
man
will
do
this
pertinaciously
and
when
his
selected
enemy
is
wealthy
and
of
high
standing
he
will
generally
succeed
in
getting
a
party
round
him
in
rufford
there
were
not
a
few
who
thought
that
lord
rufford
pheasants
and
foxes
were
a
nuisance
though
probably
these
persons
had
never
suffered
in
any
way
themselves
it
was
a
grand
thing
to
fight
a
lord
and
so
scrobby
had
a
party
when
the
action
against
his
lordship
was
first
threatened
by
goarly
and
when
it
was
understood
that
scrobby
had
backed
him
with
money
there
was
a
feeling
that
scrobby
was
doing
rather
a
fine
thing
he
had
not
indeed
used
his
money
openly
as
the
senator
had
afterwards
done
but
that
was
not
scrobby
way
if
goarly
had
been
any
help
was
legitimate
and
the
party
as
a
party
was
proud
of
their
man
but
when
it
came
to
pass
that
poison
had
been
laid
down
wholesale
as
the
hunting
men
said
in
dillsborough
wood
in
the
close
vicinity
of
goarly
house
then
the
party
hesitated
such
strategy
as
that
was
disgusting
but
was
there
reason
to
think
that
scrobby
had
been
concerned
in
the
matter
scrobby
still
had
an
income
and
ate
roast
meat
or
boiled
every
day
for
his
dinner
was
it
likely
that
such
a
man
should
deal
in
herrings
and
strychnine
nickem
had
been
at
work
for
the
last
three
months
backed
up
by
funds
which
had
latterly
been
provided
by
the
lord
agent
and
had
in
truth
run
the
matter
down
nickem
had
found
out
all
about
it
and
in
his
pride
had
resigned
his
stool
in
masters
office
but
the
scrobby
party
in
rufford
could
not
bring
itself
to
believe
that
nickem
was
correct
that
goarly
hand
had
actually
placed
the
herrings
no
man
either
at
rufford
or
dillsborough
had
doubted
such
was
now
nickem
story
but
of
what
avail
would
be
the
evidence
of
such
a
man
as
goarly
against
such
a
man
as
scrobby
it
would
be
utterly
worthless
unless
corroborated
and
the
scrobby
party
was
not
yet
aware
how
clever
nickem
had
been
thus
all
rufford
was
interested
in
the
case
lord
rufford
sir
george
penwether
his
lordship
agent
and
gotobed
had
been
summoned
as
witnesses
the
expenditure
of
money
by
the
senator
having
by
this
time
become
notorious
and
on
the
morning
of
the
trial
they
all
went
into
the
town
in
his
lordship
drag
the
senator
as
the
guest
was
on
the
with
his
lordship
and
as
they
passed
old
runce
trotting
into
rufford
on
his
nag
gotobed
began
to
tell
the
story
of
yesterday
meeting
complaining
of
the
absurdity
of
the
old
farmer
anger
penwether
told
me
about
it
said
the
lord
i
suppose
your
tenant
is
a
little
crazy
by
no
means
i
thought
he
was
right
in
what
he
said
if
i
understood
penwether
he
could
have
been
right
he
turned
from
me
in
disgust
simply
because
i
tried
to
explain
to
him
that
a
rogue
has
as
much
right
to
be
defended
by
the
law
as
an
honest
man
runce
looks
upon
these
men
as
vermin
which
ought
to
be
hunted
down
but
they
are
not
vermin
they
are
men
and
till
they
have
been
found
guilty
they
are
innocent
men
if
a
man
had
murdered
your
child
would
he
be
innocent
in
your
eyes
till
he
was
convicted
i
hope
so
but
i
should
be
very
anxious
to
bring
home
the
crime
against
him
and
should
he
be
found
guilty
even
then
he
should
not
be
made
subject
to
other
punishment
than
that
the
law
awards
runce
is
angry
with
me
because
i
do
not
think
that
goarly
should
be
crushed
under
the
heels
of
all
his
neighbours
take
care
my
lord
did
we
come
round
that
corner
rather
sharp
then
lord
rufford
emphatically
declared
that
such
men
as
scrobby
and
goarly
should
be
crushed
and
the
senator
with
an
inward
sigh
declared
that
between
landlord
and
tenant
between
peer
and
farmer
between
legislator
and
rustic
there
was
in
capacity
for
logical
inference
no
difference
whatever
the
british
heart
might
be
all
right
but
the
british
head
was
ah
hopelessly
wooden
it
would
be
his
duty
to
say
so
in
his
lecture
and
perhaps
some
good
might
be
done
to
so
gracious
but
so
stolid
a
people
if
only
they
could
be
got
to
listen
scrobby
had
got
down
a
barrister
from
london
and
therefore
the
case
was
allowed
to
drag
itself
out
through
the
whole
day
lord
rufford
as
a
magistrate
went
on
to
the
bench
himself
though
he
explained
that
he
only
took
his
seat
there
as
a
spectator
sir
george
and
gotobed
were
also
allowed
to
sit
in
the
high
place
though
the
senator
complained
even
of
this
goarly
and
scrobby
were
not
allowed
to
be
there
and
lord
rufford
in
his
opinion
should
also
have
been
debarred
from
such
a
privilege
a
long
time
was
occupied
before
even
a
jury
could
be
sworn
the
barrister
earning
his
money
by
the
provincial
bench
and
putting
various
obstacles
in
the
way
of
the
trial
as
he
was
used
to
practice
at
the
assizes
of
course
he
was
able
to
domineer
this
juror
would
not
do
nor
that
the
chairman
was
all
wrong
in
his
law
the
officers
of
the
court
knew
nothing
about
it
at
first
there
was
quite
a
triumph
for
the
scrobbyites
and
even
nickem
himself
was
frightened
but
at
last
the
real
case
was
allowed
to
begin
and
goarly
was
soon
in
the
goarly
did
not
seem
to
enjoy
the
day
and
was
with
difficulty
got
to
tell
his
own
story
even
on
his
own
side
but
the
story
when
it
was
told
was
simple
enough
he
had
met
scrobby
accidentally
in
rufford
and
they
two
had
together
discussed
the
affairs
of
the
young
lord
they
came
to
an
agreement
that
the
young
lord
was
a
tyrant
and
ought
to
be
put
down
and
scrobby
showed
how
it
was
to
be
done
scrobby
instigated
the
action
about
the
pheasants
and
undertook
to
pay
the
expenses
if
goarly
would
act
in
the
other
little
matter
but
when
he
found
that
the
senator
money
was
forthcoming
he
had
been
anything
but
as
good
as
his
word
goarly
swore
that
in
hard
cash
he
had
never
seen
more
than
four
shillings
of
scrobby
money
as
to
the
poison
goarly
declared
that
he
knew
nothing
about
it
but
he
certainly
had
received
a
parcel
of
herrings
from
scrobby
own
hands
and
in
obedience
to
scrobby
directions
had
laid
them
down
in
dillsborough
wood
the
very
morning
on
which
the
hounds
had
come
there
he
owned
that
he
supposed
that
there
might
be
something
in
the
herrings
something
that
would
probably
be
deleterious
to
hounds
as
well
as
foxes
or
to
children
should
the
herrings
happen
to
fall
into
children
hands
but
he
assured
the
court
that
he
had
no
knowledge
of
poison
none
whatever
then
he
was
made
by
the
other
side
to
give
a
complete
and
a
somewhat
prolonged
account
of
his
own
life
up
to
the
present
time
this
information
being
of
course
required
by
the
learned
barrister
on
the
other
side
in
listening
to
which
the
senator
did
become
thoroughly
ashamed
of
the
briton
whom
he
had
assisted
with
his
generosity
but
all
this
would
have
been
nothing
had
not
nickem
secured
the
old
woman
who
had
sold
the
herrings
and
also
the
chemist
from
whom
the
strychnine
had
been
purchased
as
much
as
three
years
previously
this
latter
feat
was
nickem
great
triumph
the
feeling
of
the
glory
of
which
induced
him
to
throw
up
his
employment
in
office
and
thus
brought
him
and
his
family
to
absolute
ruin
within
a
few
months
in
spite
of
the
liberal
answers
which
were
made
by
lord
rufford
to
many
of
his
numerous
appeals
away
in
norrington
the
poison
had
been
purchased
as
much
as
three
years
ago
and
yet
nickem
had
had
the
luck
to
find
it
out
when
the
scrobbyites
heard
that
scrobby
had
gone
all
the
way
to
norrington
to
buy
strychnine
to
kill
rats
they
were
scrobbyites
no
longer
i
hope
they
hang
i
do
hope
they
hang
said
runce
quite
out
loud
from
his
crowded
seat
just
behind
the
attorney
bench
the
barrister
of
course
struggled
hard
to
earn
his
money
though
he
could
not
save
his
client
he
might
annoy
the
other
side
he
insisted
therefore
on
bringing
the
whole
affair
of
the
pheasants
before
the
court
and
examined
the
senator
at
great
length
he
asked
the
senator
whether
he
had
not
found
himself
compelled
to
sympathise
with
the
wrongs
he
had
witnessed
the
senator
declared
that
he
had
witnessed
no
wrongs
why
then
had
he
interfered
because
he
had
thought
that
there
might
be
wrong
and
because
he
wished
to
see
what
power
a
poor
man
in
this
country
would
have
against
a
rich
one
he
was
induced
still
to
think
that
goarly
had
been
about
the
pheasants
but
he
could
not
take
upon
himself
to
say
that
he
had
witnessed
any
wrong
done
but
he
was
quite
sure
that
the
system
on
which
such
things
were
managed
in
england
was
at
variance
with
that
even
justice
which
prevailed
in
his
own
country
yes
by
his
own
country
he
did
mean
mickewa
he
could
tell
that
learned
gentleman
in
spite
of
his
sneers
and
in
spite
of
his
evident
ignorance
of
geography
that
nowhere
on
the
earth
surface
was
justice
more
purely
administered
than
in
the
great
western
state
of
mickewa
it
was
felt
by
everybody
that
the
senator
had
the
best
of
it
scrobby
was
sent
into
durance
for
twelve
months
with
hard
labour
and
goarly
was
conveyed
away
in
the
custody
of
the
police
lest
he
should
be
torn
to
pieces
by
the
rough
lovers
of
hunting
who
were
congregated
outside
when
the
sentence
had
reached
runce
ears
and
had
been
twice
explained
to
him
first
by
one
neighbour
and
then
by
another
his
face
assumed
the
very
look
which
it
had
worn
when
he
carried
away
his
victuals
from
the
senator
side
at
rufford
hall
and
when
he
had
turned
his
pony
round
on
his
own
land
on
the
previous
evening
the
man
had
killed
a
fox
and
might
have
killed
a
dozen
hounds
and
was
to
be
locked
up
only
for
twelve
months
he
indignantly
asked
his
neighbour
what
had
come
of
van
diemen
land
and
what
was
the
use
of
botany
bay
on
their
way
back
to
rufford
hall
lord
rufford
would
have
been
triumphant
had
not
the
senator
checked
him
it
a
bad
state
of
things
altogether
he
said
of
course
the
promiscuous
use
of
strychnine
is
objectionable
rather
said
his
lordship
but
is
it
odd
that
an
utterly
uneducated
man
one
whom
his
country
has
left
to
grow
up
in
the
ignorance
of
a
brute
should
have
recourse
to
any
measure
however
objectionable
when
the
law
will
absolutely
give
him
no
redress
against
the
trespass
made
by
a
couple
of
hundred
horsemen
lord
rufford
gave
it
up
feeling
the
senator
to
be
a
man
with
whom
he
could
not
argue
chapter
xvi
at
last
when
once
morton
had
taken
her
departure
for
london
on
the
day
after
her
grandson
death
nothing
further
was
heard
of
her
at
bragton
she
locked
up
everything
and
took
all
the
keys
away
as
though
still
hoping
against
hope
that
the
will
might
turn
out
to
be
other
than
she
expected
but
when
the
lawyer
came
down
to
read
the
document
he
brought
the
keys
back
with
him
and
no
further
tidings
reached
dillsborough
respecting
the
old
woman
she
still
drew
her
income
as
she
had
done
for
half
a
century
but
never
even
came
to
look
at
the
stone
which
reginald
put
up
on
the
walls
of
bragton
church
to
perpetuate
the
memory
of
his
cousin
what
moans
she
made
she
made
in
silent
obscurity
and
devoted
the
remainder
of
her
years
to
putting
together
money
for
members
of
her
own
family
who
took
no
notice
of
her
after
the
funeral
lady
ushant
returned
to
the
house
at
the
request
of
her
nephew
who
declared
his
purpose
of
remaining
at
hoppet
hall
for
the
present
she
expostulated
with
him
and
received
from
him
an
assurance
that
he
would
take
up
his
residence
as
squire
at
bragton
as
soon
as
he
married
a
wife
should
he
ever
do
so
in
the
meantime
he
could
he
thought
perform
his
duties
from
hoppet
hall
as
well
as
on
the
spot
as
a
residence
for
a
bachelor
he
preferred
he
said
hoppet
hall
to
the
park
lady
ushant
yielded
and
returned
once
again
to
her
old
home
the
house
in
which
she
had
been
born
and
gave
up
her
lodgings
at
cheltenham
the
word
that
he
said
about
his
possible
marriage
set
her
mind
at
work
and
induced
her
to
put
sundry
questions
to
him
of
course
you
will
marry
she
said
men
who
have
property
to
leave
behind
them
usually
do
marry
and
as
i
am
not
wiser
than
others
i
probably
may
do
so
but
i
will
not
admit
that
it
is
a
matter
of
course
i
may
escape
yet
i
do
hope
you
will
marry
i
hope
it
may
be
before
i
die
so
that
i
may
see
her
and
disapprove
of
her
ten
to
one
certainly
i
shall
not
if
you
tell
me
that
you
love
her
then
i
will
tell
you
so
to
prevent
disagreeable
results
i
am
quite
sure
there
must
be
somebody
that
you
like
reginald
she
said
after
a
pause
are
you
i
do
know
that
i
have
shown
any
very
strong
preference
i
am
not
disposed
to
praise
myself
for
many
things
but
i
really
do
think
that
i
have
been
as
undemonstrative
as
most
men
of
my
age
still
i
did
hope
what
did
you
hope
i
wo
mention
any
name
i
do
think
it
is
right
i
have
observed
that
more
harm
than
good
comes
of
such
talking
and
i
have
determined
always
to
avoid
it
but
then
there
was
another
pause
remember
how
old
i
am
reginald
and
when
it
is
to
be
done
give
me
at
any
rate
the
pleasure
of
knowing
it
of
course
he
knew
to
whom
she
alluded
and
of
course
he
laughed
at
her
feeble
caution
but
he
would
not
say
a
word
to
encourage
her
to
mention
the
name
of
mary
masters
he
thought
that
he
was
sure
that
were
the
girl
free
he
would
now
ask
her
to
be
his
wife
if
he
loved
any
one
it
was
her
if
he
had
ever
known
a
woman
with
whom
he
thought
it
would
be
pleasant
to
share
the
joy
and
labours
of
life
it
was
mary
masters
if
he
could
imagine
that
any
one
constant
companion
would
be
a
joy
to
him
she
would
be
that
person
but
he
had
been
distinctly
informed
that
she
was
in
love
with
some
one
and
not
for
worlds
would
he
ask
for
that
which
had
been
given
to
another
and
not
for
worlds
would
he
hazard
the
chance
of
a
refusal
he
thought
that
he
could
understand
the
delight
that
he
could
thoroughly
enjoy
the
rapture
of
hearing
her
whisper
with
downcast
eyes
that
she
could
love
him
he
had
imagination
enough
to
build
castles
in
the
air
in
which
she
reigned
as
princess
in
which
she
would
lie
with
her
head
upon
his
bosom
and
tell
him
that
he
was
her
chosen
prince
but
he
would
hardly
know
how
to
bear
himself
should
he
ask
in
vain
he
believed
he
could
love
as
well
as
lawrence
twentyman
but
he
was
sure
that
he
could
not
continue
his
quest
as
that
young
man
had
done
when
lady
ushant
had
been
a
day
or
two
at
the
house
she
asked
him
whether
she
might
invite
mary
there
as
her
guest
as
her
perpetual
i
have
no
objection
in
life
he
said
but
take
care
that
you
do
interfere
with
her
happiness
because
of
her
father
and
sisters
suggested
the
innocent
old
lady
she
a
father
has
she
a
mother
or
has
she
a
dearer
one
still
than
all
other
said
reginald
laughing
perhaps
she
has
then
do
interfere
with
her
happiness
in
that
direction
how
is
she
to
have
a
lover
come
to
see
her
out
here
why
not
i
do
see
why
she
should
have
a
lover
here
as
well
as
in
dillsborough
i
do
object
to
lovers
if
they
are
of
the
proper
sort
and
i
am
sure
mary
would
have
anything
else
reginald
told
her
she
might
do
as
she
pleased
and
made
no
further
inquiry
as
to
mary
lovers
a
few
days
afterwards
mary
went
with
her
boxes
to
bragton
masters
repeating
her
objections
but
repeating
them
with
but
little
energy
just
at
this
time
a
stroke
of
good
fortune
befell
the
masters
family
generally
which
greatly
reduced
her
power
over
her
husband
reginald
morton
had
spent
an
hour
in
the
attorney
office
and
had
declared
his
purpose
of
restoring
masters
to
his
old
family
position
in
regard
to
the
bragton
estate
when
she
heard
it
she
felt
at
once
that
her
dominion
was
gone
she
had
based
everything
on
the
growing
inferiority
of
her
husband
position
and
now
he
was
about
to
have
all
his
glory
back
again
she
had
inveighed
against
gentlemen
from
the
day
of
her
marriage
and
here
he
was
again
to
be
immersed
up
to
his
eyes
in
the
affairs
of
a
gentleman
and
then
she
had
been
so
wrong
about
goarly
and
lord
rufford
had
been
so
much
better
a
client
and
ready
money
had
been
so
much
more
plentiful
of
late
owing
to
poor
john
morton
honesty
she
had
very
little
to
say
about
it
when
mary
packed
her
boxes
and
was
taken
in
runciman
fly
to
bragton
since
the
old
days
the
old
days
of
all
since
the
days
to
which
reginald
had
referred
when
he
asked
her
to
pass
over
the
bridge
with
him
she
had
never
yet
walked
about
the
bragton
grounds
she
had
often
been
to
the
house
visiting
lady
ushant
but
she
had
simply
gone
thither
and
returned
and
indeed
when
the
house
had
been
empty
the
walk
from
dillsborough
to
the
bridge
and
back
had
been
sufficient
exercise
for
herself
and
her
sisters
but
now
she
could
go
whither
she
listed
and
bring
her
memory
to
all
the
old
spots
with
the
tenacity
as
to
household
matters
which
characterised
the
ladies
of
the
country
some
years
since
lady
ushant
employed
all
her
mornings
and
those
of
her
young
friend
in
making
inventories
of
everything
that
was
found
in
the
house
but
her
afternoons
were
her
own
and
she
wandered
about
with
a
freedom
she
had
never
known
before
at
this
time
reginald
morton
was
up
in
london
and
had
been
away
nearly
a
week
he
had
gone
intending
to
be
absent
for
some
undefined
time
so
that
lady
ushant
and
hopkins
were
free
from
all
interruption
it
was
as
yet
only
the
middle
of
march
and
the
lion
had
not
altogether
disappeared
but
still
mary
could
get
out
she
did
not
care
much
for
the
wind
and
she
roamed
about
among
the
leafless
shrubberies
thinking
probably
not
of
many
things
meaning
always
to
think
of
the
past
but
unable
to
keep
her
mind
from
the
future
the
future
which
would
so
soon
be
the
present
how
long
would
it
be
before
the
coming
of
that
stately
dame
was
he
in
quest
of
her
now
had
he
perhaps
postponed
his
demand
upon
her
till
fortune
had
made
him
rich
of
course
she
had
no
right
to
be
sorry
that
he
had
inherited
the
property
which
had
been
his
almost
of
right
but
yet
had
it
been
otherwise
might
she
not
have
had
some
chance
but
oh
if
he
had
said
a
word
to
her
only
a
word
more
than
he
had
spoken
already
a
word
that
might
have
sounded
like
encouragement
to
others
beside
herself
and
then
have
been
obliged
to
draw
back
because
of
the
duty
which
he
owed
to
the
property
how
much
worse
would
that
have
been
she
did
own
to
herself
that
the
squire
of
bragton
should
not
look
for
his
wife
in
the
house
of
a
dillsborough
attorney
as
she
thought
of
this
a
tear
ran
down
her
cheek
and
trickled
down
on
to
the
wooden
rail
of
the
little
bridge
there
no
one
to
give
you
an
excuse
now
and
you
must
come
and
walk
round
with
me
said
a
voice
close
to
her
ear
oh
morton
how
you
have
startled
me
is
there
anything
the
matter
mary
said
he
looking
up
into
her
face
only
you
have
startled
me
so
has
that
brought
tears
into
your
eyes
well
i
suppose
so
she
said
trying
to
smile
you
were
so
very
quiet
and
i
thought
you
were
in
london
so
i
was
this
morning
and
now
i
am
here
but
something
else
has
made
you
unhappy
no
nothing
i
wish
we
could
be
friends
mary
i
wish
i
could
know
your
secret
you
have
a
secret
no
she
said
boldly
is
there
nothing
what
should
there
be
mr
morton
tell
me
why
you
were
crying
i
was
not
crying
just
a
tear
is
not
crying
sometimes
one
does
get
melancholy
one
ca
cry
when
there
is
any
one
to
look
and
so
one
does
it
alone
i
have
been
laughing
if
i
knew
that
you
were
coming
come
round
by
the
kennels
you
can
get
over
the
wall
ca
you
oh
yes
and
we
go
down
the
old
orchard
and
get
out
by
the
corner
of
the
park
fence
then
he
walked
and
she
followed
him
hardly
keeping
close
by
his
side
and
thinking
as
she
went
how
foolish
she
had
been
not
to
have
avoided
the
perils
and
fresh
troubles
of
such
a
walk
when
he
was
helping
her
over
the
wall
he
held
her
hands
for
a
moment
and
she
was
aware
of
unusual
pressure
it
was
the
pressure
of
love
or
of
that
pretence
of
love
which
young
men
and
perhaps
old
men
sometimes
permit
themselves
to
affect
in
an
ordinary
way
mary
would
have
thought
as
little
of
it
as
another
girl
she
might
feel
dislike
to
the
man
but
the
affair
would
be
too
light
for
resentment
with
this
man
it
was
different
he
certainly
was
not
justified
in
making
the
slightest
expression
of
factitious
affection
he
at
any
rate
should
have
felt
himself
bound
to
abstain
from
any
touch
of
peculiar
tenderness
she
would
not
say
a
word
she
would
not
even
look
at
him
with
angry
eyes
but
she
twitched
both
her
hands
away
from
him
as
she
sprang
to
the
ground
then
there
was
a
passage
across
the
orchard
not
more
than
a
hundred
yards
and
after
that
a
stile
at
the
stile
she
insisted
on
using
her
own
hand
for
the
custody
of
her
dress
she
would
not
even
touch
his
outstretched
arm
you
are
very
independent
he
said
i
have
to
be
so
i
can
not
make
you
out
mary
i
wonder
whether
there
is
still
anything
rankling
in
your
bosom
against
me
oh
dear
no
what
should
rankle
with
me
what
indeed
unless
you
resent
my
regard
i
am
not
so
rich
in
friends
as
to
do
that
mr
morton
i
do
suppose
there
can
be
many
people
who
have
the
same
sort
of
feeling
for
you
that
i
have
there
are
not
many
who
have
known
me
so
long
certainly
you
have
some
friend
i
know
he
said
more
than
one
i
hope
some
special
friend
who
is
he
mary
i
do
know
what
you
mean
mr
morton
she
then
thought
that
he
was
still
alluding
to
lawrence
twentyman
tell
me
mary
what
am
i
to
tell
you
your
father
says
that
there
is
some
one
papa
yes
your
father
then
she
remembered
it
all
how
she
had
been
driven
into
a
half
confession
to
her
father
she
could
not
say
there
was
nobody
she
certainly
could
not
say
who
that
some
one
was
she
could
not
be
silent
for
by
silence
she
would
be
confessing
a
passion
for
some
other
man
a
passion
which
certainly
had
no
existence
i
do
know
why
papa
should
talk
about
me
she
said
and
i
certainly
do
know
why
you
should
repeat
what
he
said
but
there
is
some
one
she
clenched
her
fist
and
hit
out
at
the
air
with
her
parasol
and
knit
her
brows
as
she
looked
up
at
him
with
a
glance
of
fire
in
her
eye
which
he
had
never
seen
there
before
believe
me
mary
he
said
if
ever
a
girl
had
a
sincere
friend
you
have
one
in
me
i
would
not
tease
you
by
impertinence
in
such
a
matter
i
will
be
as
faithful
to
you
as
the
sun
do
you
love
any
one
yes
she
said
turning
round
at
him
with
ferocity
and
shouting
out
her
answer
as
she
pressed
on
who
is
he
mary
what
right
have
you
to
ask
me
what
right
can
any
one
have
even
your
aunt
would
not
press
me
as
you
are
doing
my
aunt
could
not
have
the
same
interest
who
is
he
mary
i
will
not
tell
you
he
paused
a
few
moments
and
walked
on
a
step
or
two
before
he
spoke
again
i
would
it
were
i
he
said
what
she
ejaculated
i
would
it
were
i
he
repeated
one
glance
of
her
eye
stole
itself
round
into
his
face
and
then
her
face
was
turned
quickly
to
the
ground
her
parasol
which
had
been
raised
drooped
listless
from
her
hand
all
unconsciously
she
hastened
her
steps
and
became
aware
that
the
tears
were
streaming
from
her
eyes
for
a
moment
or
two
it
seemed
to
her
that
all
was
still
hopeless
if
he
had
no
more
to
say
than
that
certainly
she
had
not
a
word
he
had
made
her
no
tender
of
his
love
he
had
not
told
her
that
in
very
truth
she
was
his
chosen
one
after
all
she
was
not
sure
that
she
understood
the
meaning
of
those
words
i
would
it
were
i
but
the
tears
were
coming
so
quick
that
she
could
see
nothing
of
the
things
around
her
and
she
did
not
dare
even
to
put
her
hand
up
to
her
eyes
if
he
wanted
her
love
if
it
was
possible
that
he
really
wished
for
it
why
did
he
not
ask
for
it
she
felt
his
footsteps
close
to
hers
and
she
was
tempted
to
walk
on
quicker
even
than
before
then
there
came
the
fingers
of
a
hand
round
her
waist
stealing
gradually
on
till
she
felt
the
pressure
of
his
body
on
her
shoulders
she
put
her
hand
up
weakly
to
push
back
the
intruding
fingers
only
to
leave
it
tight
in
his
grasp
then
then
was
the
first
moment
in
which
she
realized
the
truth
after
all
he
did
love
her
surely
he
would
not
hold
her
there
unless
he
meant
her
to
know
that
he
loved
her
mary
he
said
to
speak
was
impossible
but
she
turned
round
and
looked
at
him
with
imploring
eyes
mary
say
that
you
will
be
my
wife
chapter
xvii
my
own
own
husband
yes
it
had
come
at
last
as
one
may
imagine
to
be
the
certainty
of
paradise
to
the
doubting
fearful
all
but
despairing
soul
when
it
has
passed
through
the
gates
of
death
and
found
in
new
worlds
a
reality
of
assured
bliss
so
was
the
assurance
to
her
conveyed
by
that
simple
request
mary
say
that
you
will
be
my
wife
it
did
not
seem
to
her
that
any
answer
was
necessary
will
it
be
required
that
the
spirit
shall
assent
to
its
entrance
into
elysium
was
there
room
for
doubt
he
would
never
go
back
from
his
word
now
he
would
not
have
spoken
the
word
had
he
not
been
quite
quite
certain
and
he
had
loved
her
all
that
time
when
she
was
so
hard
to
him
it
must
have
been
so
he
had
loved
her
this
bright
one
even
when
he
thought
that
she
was
to
be
given
to
that
rustic
lover
perhaps
that
was
the
sweetest
of
it
all
though
in
draining
the
sweet
draught
she
had
to
accuse
herself
of
hardness
blindness
and
injustice
could
it
be
real
was
it
true
that
she
had
her
foot
firmly
placed
in
paradise
he
was
there
close
to
her
with
his
arm
still
round
her
and
her
fingers
grasped
within
his
the
word
wife
was
still
in
her
ears
surely
the
sweetest
word
in
all
the
language
what
protestation
of
love
could
have
been
so
eloquent
as
that
question
will
you
be
my
wife
no
true
man
she
thought
ever
ought
to
ask
the
question
in
any
other
form
but
her
eyes
were
still
full
of
tears
and
as
she
went
she
knew
not
where
she
was
going
she
had
forgotten
all
her
surroundings
being
only
aware
that
he
was
with
her
and
that
no
other
eyes
were
on
them
then
there
was
another
stile
on
reaching
which
he
withdrew
his
arm
and
stood
facing
her
with
his
back
leaning
against
it
why
do
you
weep
he
said
and
mary
why
do
you
not
answer
my
question
if
there
be
anybody
else
you
must
tell
me
now
there
is
nobody
else
she
said
almost
angrily
there
never
was
there
never
could
be
and
yet
there
was
somebody
she
pouted
her
lips
at
him
glancing
up
into
his
face
for
half
a
second
and
then
again
hung
her
head
down
mary
do
not
grudge
me
my
delight
no
no
no
but
you
do
no
if
there
can
be
delight
to
you
in
so
poor
a
thing
have
it
all
then
you
must
kiss
me
dear
she
gently
came
to
him
oh
so
gently
and
with
her
head
still
hanging
creeping
towards
his
shoulder
thinking
perhaps
that
the
motion
should
have
been
his
but
still
obeying
him
and
then
leaning
against
him
seemed
as
though
she
would
stoop
with
her
lips
to
his
hand
but
this
he
did
not
endure
seizing
her
quickly
in
his
arms
he
drew
her
up
till
her
not
unwilling
face
was
close
to
his
and
there
he
kept
her
till
she
was
almost
frightened
by
his
violence
and
now
mary
what
do
you
say
to
my
question
it
has
to
be
answered
you
know
but
that
will
not
do
i
will
have
it
in
words
i
will
not
be
shorn
of
my
delight
that
it
should
be
a
delight
to
him
was
the
very
essence
of
her
heaven
tell
me
what
to
say
she
answered
how
may
i
say
it
best
reginald
morton
he
began
reginald
she
repeated
it
after
him
but
went
no
farther
in
naming
him
because
i
love
you
better
than
any
other
being
in
the
world
i
do
ah
but
say
it
because
i
love
you
oh
so
much
better
than
all
the
world
besides
therefore
my
own
own
husband
therefore
my
own
own
then
she
paused
say
the
word
my
own
own
husband
i
will
be
your
true
wife
i
will
be
your
own
true
loving
wife
then
he
kissed
her
again
that
he
said
is
our
little
marriage
ceremony
under
god
sky
and
no
other
can
be
more
binding
as
soon
as
you
in
the
plentitude
of
your
maiden
power
will
fix
a
day
for
the
other
one
and
when
we
can
get
that
over
then
we
will
begin
our
little
journey
together
but
reginald
well
dear
you
have
said
anything
have
i
i
thought
i
had
said
it
all
but
you
have
said
it
for
yourself
you
say
what
you
want
and
i
repeat
it
quite
as
well
as
you
did
i
ca
do
that
say
it
yourself
i
will
be
your
true
husband
for
the
rest
of
the
journey
by
which
i
mean
it
to
be
understood
that
i
take
you
into
partnership
on
equal
terms
but
that
i
am
to
be
allowed
to
manage
the
business
just
as
i
please
yes
that
you
shall
she
said
quite
in
earnest
only
as
you
are
practical
and
i
am
vague
i
do
doubt
that
everything
will
fall
into
your
hands
before
five
years
are
over
and
that
i
shall
have
to
be
told
whether
i
can
afford
to
buy
a
new
book
and
when
i
am
to
ask
all
the
gentry
to
dinner
now
you
are
laughing
at
me
because
i
shall
know
so
little
about
anything
come
dear
let
us
get
over
the
stile
and
go
on
for
another
field
or
we
shall
never
get
round
the
park
then
she
jumped
over
after
him
just
touching
his
hand
i
was
not
laughing
at
you
at
all
i
do
in
the
least
doubt
that
in
a
very
little
time
you
will
know
everything
about
everything
i
am
so
much
afraid
you
need
be
i
know
you
well
enough
for
that
but
suppose
i
had
taken
such
a
one
as
that
young
woman
who
was
here
with
my
poor
cousin
oh
heavens
perhaps
you
ought
to
have
done
so
i
thank
the
lord
that
hath
delivered
me
you
ought
you
ought
to
have
chosen
some
lady
of
high
standing
said
mary
thinking
with
ineffable
joy
of
the
stately
dame
who
was
not
to
come
to
bragton
do
you
know
what
i
was
thinking
only
the
other
day
about
it
that
you
had
gone
up
to
london
to
look
for
some
proper
sort
of
person
and
how
did
you
mean
to
receive
her
i
should
have
received
her
at
all
i
should
have
gone
away
you
ca
do
it
now
ca
i
what
were
you
thanking
the
lord
for
so
heartily
for
you
were
you
that
is
the
sweetest
thing
you
have
said
yet
my
own
my
darling
my
dearest
if
only
i
can
so
live
that
you
may
be
able
to
thank
the
lord
for
me
in
years
to
come
i
will
not
trouble
the
reader
with
all
that
was
said
at
every
stile
no
doubt
very
much
of
what
has
been
told
was
repeated
again
and
again
so
that
the
walk
round
the
park
was
abnormally
long
at
last
however
they
reached
the
house
and
as
they
entered
the
hall
mary
whispered
to
him
who
is
to
tell
your
aunt
she
said
come
along
he
replied
striding
upstairs
to
his
aunt
bedroom
where
he
knew
she
would
be
at
this
time
he
opened
the
door
without
any
notice
and
having
waited
till
mary
had
joined
him
led
her
forcibly
into
the
middle
of
the
room
here
she
is
he
said
my
wife
elect
oh
reginald
we
have
managed
it
all
and
there
need
be
any
more
said
about
it
except
to
settle
the
day
mary
has
been
looking
about
the
house
and
learning
her
duty
already
she
be
able
to
have
every
bedstead
and
every
chair
by
heart
which
is
an
advantage
ladies
seldom
possess
then
mary
rushed
forward
and
was
received
into
the
old
woman
arms
when
reginald
left
them
which
he
did
very
soon
after
the
announcement
was
made
lady
ushant
had
a
great
deal
to
say
i
have
been
thinking
of
it
my
dear
oh
for
years
ever
since
he
came
to
hoppet
hall
but
i
am
sure
the
best
way
is
never
to
say
anything
if
i
had
interfered
there
is
no
knowing
how
it
might
have
been
then
dear
lady
ushant
i
am
so
glad
you
did
said
mary
being
tolerably
sure
at
the
same
time
within
her
own
bosom
that
her
loving
old
friend
could
have
done
no
harm
in
that
direction
i
would
say
a
word
though
i
was
always
thinking
of
it
but
then
he
is
so
odd
and
no
one
can
know
what
he
means
sometimes
what
made
me
think
when
twentyman
was
so
very
pressing
that
could
could
have
been
possible
poor
young
man
but
i
always
told
him
it
was
impossible
i
wonder
whether
you
cared
about
reginald
all
that
time
in
answer
to
this
mary
only
hid
her
face
in
the
old
woman
lap
dear
me
i
suppose
you
did
all
along
but
i
am
sure
it
was
better
not
to
say
anything
and
now
what
will
your
papa
and
mamma
say
they
hardly
believe
it
at
first
i
hope
they
be
glad
glad
why
what
do
you
suppose
they
would
want
me
to
do
dear
papa
and
dear
mamma
too
because
she
has
really
been
good
to
me
i
wonder
when
it
must
be
then
that
question
was
discussed
at
great
length
and
lady
ushant
had
a
great
deal
of
very
good
advice
to
bestow
she
did
like
long
engagements
and
it
was
very
essential
for
reginald
welfare
that
he
should
settle
himself
at
bragton
as
soon
as
possible
mary
pleas
for
a
long
day
were
not
very
urgent
that
evening
at
bragton
was
rather
long
and
rather
dull
it
was
almost
the
first
that
she
had
ever
passed
in
company
with
reginald
and
there
now
seemed
to
be
a
necessity
of
doing
something
peculiar
whereas
there
was
nothing
peculiar
to
be
done
it
was
his
custom
to
betake
himself
to
his
books
after
dinner
but
he
could
hardly
do
so
with
ease
in
company
with
the
girl
who
had
just
promised
him
to
be
his
wife
lady
ushant
too
wished
to
show
her
extreme
joy
and
made
flattering
but
vain
attempts
to
be
ecstatic
mary
to
tell
the
truth
was
longing
for
solitude
feeling
that
she
could
not
yet
realise
her
happiness
not
even
when
she
was
in
bed
could
she
reduce
her
mind
to
order
it
would
have
been
all
but
impossible
even
had
he
remained
the
comparatively
humble
lord
of
hoppet
hall
but
that
the
squire
of
bragton
should
be
her
promised
husband
was
a
marvel
so
great
that
from
every
short
slumber
she
waked
with
fear
of
treacherous
dreams
a
minute
sleep
might
rob
her
of
her
joy
and
declare
to
her
in
the
moment
of
waking
that
it
was
all
an
hallucination
it
was
not
that
he
was
dearer
to
her
or
that
her
condition
was
the
happier
because
of
his
position
and
wealth
but
that
the
chance
of
his
inheritance
had
lifted
him
so
infinitely
above
her
she
thought
of
the
little
room
at
home
which
she
generally
shared
with
one
of
her
sisters
of
her
all
too
scanty
wardrobe
of
her
daily
tasks
about
the
house
of
her
stepmother
late
severity
and
of
her
father
cares
surely
he
would
not
hinder
her
from
being
good
to
them
surely
he
would
let
the
young
girls
come
to
her
from
time
to
time
what
an
added
happiness
it
would
be
if
he
would
allow
her
to
pass
on
to
them
some
sparks
of
the
prosperity
which
he
was
bestowing
on
her
and
then
her
thoughts
travelled
on
to
poor
larry
would
he
not
be
more
contented
now
now
when
he
would
be
certain
that
no
further
frantic
efforts
could
avail
him
anything
poor
larry
would
reginald
permit
her
to
regard
him
as
a
friend
and
would
he
submit
to
friendly
treatment
she
could
look
forward
and
see
him
happy
with
his
wife
the
best
loved
of
their
neighbours
for
who
was
there
in
the
world
better
than
larry
but
she
did
not
know
how
two
men
who
had
both
been
her
lovers
would
allow
themselves
to
be
brought
together
but
oh
what
peril
had
been
there
it
was
but
the
other
day
she
had
striven
so
hard
to
give
the
lie
to
her
love
and
to
become
larry
wife
she
shuddered
beneath
the
bedclothes
as
she
thought
of
the
danger
she
had
run
one
word
would
have
changed
all
her
paradise
into
a
perpetual
wail
of
tears
and
waste
of
desolation
when
she
woke
in
the
morning
from
her
long
sleep
an
effort
was
wanting
to
tell
her
that
it
was
all
true
oh
if
it
had
slipped
from
her
then
if
she
had
waked
after
such
a
dream
to
find
herself
loving
in
despair
with
a
sore
bosom
and
angry
heart
she
met
him
downstairs
early
in
the
study
having
her
first
request
to
make
to
him
might
she
go
in
at
once
after
breakfast
and
tell
them
all
i
suppose
i
ought
to
go
to
your
father
he
said
let
me
go
first
she
pleaded
hanging
on
his
arm
i
would
not
think
that
i
was
not
mindful
of
them
from
the
very
beginning
so
she
was
driven
into
dillsborough
in
the
pony
carriage
which
had
been
provided
for
old
morton
use
and
told
her
own
story
papa
she
said
going
to
the
office
door
come
into
the
house
come
at
once
and
then
within
her
father
arms
while
her
stepmother
listened
she
told
them
of
her
triumph
reginald
morton
wants
me
to
be
his
wife
and
he
is
coming
here
to
ask
you
the
lord
in
heaven
be
good
to
us
said
masters
holding
up
both
her
hands
is
it
true
child
the
squire
it
is
true
papa
and
and
and
what
my
love
when
he
comes
to
you
you
must
say
i
will
be
there
was
not
much
danger
on
that
score
was
it
he
that
you
told
me
of
said
the
attorney
to
this
she
only
nodded
her
assent
it
was
reginald
morton
all
the
time
well
why
should
it
be
he
oh
no
my
dear
you
are
a
most
fortunate
girl
most
fortunate
but
somehow
i
never
thought
of
it
that
a
child
of
mine
should
come
to
live
at
bragton
and
have
it
one
may
say
partly
as
her
own
it
is
odd
after
all
that
has
come
and
gone
god
bless
you
my
dear
and
make
you
happy
you
are
a
very
fortunate
child
masters
was
quite
overpowered
she
had
thrown
herself
on
to
the
old
family
sofa
and
was
fanning
herself
with
her
handkerchief
she
had
been
wrong
throughout
and
was
now
completely
humiliated
by
the
family
success
and
yet
she
was
delighted
though
she
did
not
dare
to
be
triumphant
she
had
so
often
asked
both
father
and
daughter
what
good
gentlemen
would
do
to
either
of
them
and
now
the
girl
was
engaged
to
marry
the
richest
gentleman
in
the
neighbourhood
in
any
expression
of
joy
she
would
be
driven
to
confess
how
wrong
she
had
always
been
how
often
had
she
asked
what
would
come
of
ushanting
this
it
was
that
had
come
of
ushanting
the
girl
had
been
made
fit
to
be
the
companion
of
such
a
one
as
reginald
morton
and
had
now
fallen
into
the
position
which
was
suited
to
her
of
course
we
shall
see
nothing
of
you
now
she
said
in
a
whimpering
voice
it
was
not
a
gracious
speech
but
it
was
almost
justified
by
disappointments
mamma
you
know
that
i
shall
never
separate
myself
from
you
and
the
girls
poor
larry
said
the
woman
sobbing
of
course
it
is
all
for
the
best
but
i
do
know
what
he
do
now
you
must
tell
him
papa
said
mary
and
give
him
my
love
and
bid
him
be
a
man
chapter
xviii
bid
him
be
a
man
the
little
phaeton
remained
in
dillsborough
to
take
mary
back
to
bragton
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
the
attorney
went
over
to
the
bush
with
the
purpose
of
borrowing
runciman
pony
so
that
he
might
ride
over
to
chowton
farm
and
at
once
execute
his
daughter
last
request
in
the
yard
of
the
inn
he
saw
runciman
himself
and
was
quite
unable
to
keep
his
good
news
to
himself
my
girl
has
just
been
with
me
he
said
and
what
do
you
think
she
tells
me
that
she
is
going
to
take
poor
larry
after
all
she
might
do
worse
mr
masters
poor
larry
i
am
sorry
for
him
i
have
always
liked
larry
twentyman
but
that
is
all
over
now
she
not
going
to
have
that
tweedledum
young
parson
surely
reginald
morton
has
made
her
a
set
offer
the
squire
masters
nodded
his
head
three
times
you
do
say
so
well
masters
i
do
begrudge
it
you
he
might
do
worse
she
has
taken
her
pigs
well
to
market
at
last
he
is
to
come
to
me
at
four
this
afternoon
well
done
miss
mary
i
suppose
it
been
going
on
ever
so
long
we
fathers
and
mothers
said
the
attorney
never
really
know
what
the
young
ones
are
after
do
mention
it
just
at
present
runciman
you
are
such
an
old
friend
that
i
could
help
telling
you
poor
larry
i
can
have
the
pony
runciman
certainly
you
can
masters
tell
him
to
come
in
and
talk
it
all
over
with
me
if
we
do
look
to
it
he
be
taking
to
drink
regular
at
that
last
meeting
at
the
club
when
the
late
will
was
discussed
at
which
as
the
reader
may
perhaps
remember
a
little
supper
was
also
discussed
in
honour
of
the
occasion
poor
larry
had
not
only
been
present
but
had
drunk
so
that
the
landlord
had
been
obliged
to
put
him
to
bed
at
the
inn
and
he
had
not
been
at
all
as
he
ought
to
have
been
after
lord
dinner
such
delinquencies
were
quite
outside
the
young
accustomed
way
of
his
life
it
had
been
one
of
his
recognised
virtues
that
living
as
he
did
a
good
deal
among
sporting
men
and
with
a
full
command
of
means
he
had
never
drank
but
now
he
had
twice
sinned
before
the
eyes
of
all
dillsborough
and
runciman
thought
that
he
knew
how
it
would
be
with
a
young
man
in
his
own
house
who
got
drunk
in
public
to
drown
his
sorrow
i
would
see
larry
go
astray
and
spoil
himself
with
liquor
said
the
publican
for
more
than
i
should
like
to
name
masters
promised
to
take
the
hint
and
rode
off
on
his
mission
the
entrance
to
chowton
farm
and
bragton
gate
were
nearly
opposite
the
latter
being
perhaps
a
furlong
nearer
to
dillsborough
the
attorney
when
he
got
to
the
gate
stopped
a
moment
and
looked
up
the
avenue
with
pardonable
pride
the
great
calamity
of
his
life
the
stunning
blow
which
had
almost
unmanned
him
when
he
was
young
and
from
which
he
had
never
quite
been
able
to
rouse
himself
had
been
the
loss
of
the
management
of
the
bragton
property
his
grandfather
and
his
father
had
been
powerful
at
bragton
and
he
had
been
brought
up
in
the
hope
of
walking
in
their
paths
then
strangers
had
come
in
and
he
had
been
dispossessed
but
how
was
it
with
him
now
it
had
almost
made
a
young
man
of
him
again
when
reginald
morton
stepping
into
his
office
asked
him
as
a
favour
to
resume
his
old
task
but
what
was
that
in
comparison
with
this
later
triumph
his
own
child
was
to
be
made
queen
of
the
place
his
grandson
should
she
be
fortunate
enough
to
be
the
mother
of
a
son
would
be
the
squire
himself
his
visits
to
the
place
for
the
last
twenty
years
had
been
very
rare
indeed
he
had
been
sent
for
lately
by
old
morton
for
a
purpose
which
if
carried
out
would
have
robbed
him
of
all
his
good
fortune
but
he
could
not
remember
when
before
that
he
had
even
passed
through
the
gateway
now
it
would
all
become
familiar
to
him
again
that
pony
of
runciman
was
pleasant
in
his
paces
and
he
began
to
calculate
whether
the
innkeeper
would
part
with
the
animal
he
stood
thus
gazing
at
the
place
for
some
minutes
till
he
saw
reginald
morton
in
the
distance
turning
a
corner
of
the
road
with
mary
at
his
side
he
had
taken
her
from
the
phaeton
and
had
then
insisted
on
her
coming
out
with
him
before
she
took
off
her
hat
masters
as
soon
as
he
saw
them
trotted
off
to
chowton
farm
finding
larry
lounging
at
the
little
garden
gate
masters
got
off
the
pony
and
taking
the
young
man
arm
walked
off
with
him
towards
dillsborough
wood
he
told
all
his
news
at
once
almost
annihilating
poor
larry
by
the
suddenness
of
the
blow
larry
reginald
morton
has
asked
my
girl
to
marry
him
and
she
has
accepted
him
the
new
squire
said
larry
stopping
himself
on
the
path
and
looking
as
though
a
gentle
wind
would
suffice
to
blow
him
over
i
suppose
it
has
been
that
way
all
along
larry
though
we
have
not
known
it
it
was
morton
then
that
she
told
me
of
she
did
tell
you
of
course
there
was
no
chance
for
me
if
he
wanted
her
but
why
did
they
speak
out
so
that
i
could
have
gone
away
oh
mr
masters
it
was
only
yesterday
she
knew
it
herself
she
must
have
guessed
it
no
she
knew
nothing
till
he
declared
himself
and
this
very
morning
she
has
bade
me
come
to
you
and
let
you
know
it
and
she
sent
you
her
love
her
love
said
larry
chucking
the
stick
which
he
held
in
his
hands
down
to
the
ground
and
then
stooping
to
pick
it
up
again
yes
her
love
those
were
her
words
and
i
am
to
tell
you
from
her
to
be
a
man
did
she
say
that
yes
i
was
to
come
out
to
you
at
once
and
bring
you
that
as
a
message
from
her
be
a
man
i
could
have
been
a
man
right
enough
if
she
would
have
made
me
one
as
good
a
man
as
reginald
morton
though
he
is
squire
of
bragton
but
of
course
i
could
have
given
her
a
house
like
that
nor
a
carriage
nor
made
her
one
of
the
county
people
if
it
was
to
go
in
that
way
what
could
i
hope
for
do
be
unjust
to
her
larry
unjust
to
her
if
giving
her
every
blessed
thing
i
had
in
the
world
at
a
moment
notice
was
unjust
i
was
ready
to
be
unjust
any
day
of
the
week
or
any
hour
of
the
day
what
i
mean
is
that
her
heart
was
fixed
that
way
before
reginald
morton
was
squire
of
bragton
what
shall
i
say
in
answer
to
her
message
you
will
wish
her
happiness
will
you
not
wish
her
happiness
oh
heavens
he
could
not
explain
what
was
in
his
mind
wish
her
happiness
yes
the
happiness
of
the
angels
but
not
him
nor
yet
with
him
and
as
there
could
be
no
arranging
of
this
he
must
leave
his
wishes
unsettled
and
yet
there
was
a
certain
relief
to
him
in
the
tidings
he
had
heard
there
was
now
no
more
doubt
he
need
not
now
remain
at
chowton
thinking
it
possible
that
the
girl
might
even
yet
change
her
mind
and
you
will
bear
in
mind
that
she
wishes
you
to
be
a
man
why
did
she
not
make
me
one
but
that
is
all
all
over
you
tell
her
from
me
that
i
am
not
the
man
to
whimper
because
i
am
hurt
what
ought
a
man
to
do
that
i
ca
do
let
her
know
that
you
are
going
about
your
old
pursuits
and
larry
would
you
wish
her
to
know
how
it
was
with
you
at
the
club
last
saturday
did
she
hear
of
that
i
am
sure
she
has
not
heard
of
it
but
if
that
kind
of
thing
becomes
a
habit
of
course
she
will
hear
of
it
all
dillsborough
would
hear
of
it
if
that
became
common
at
any
rate
it
is
not
manly
to
drown
it
in
drink
who
says
i
do
that
nothing
will
drown
it
i
would
speak
if
i
had
not
known
you
so
long
and
loved
you
so
well
what
she
means
is
that
you
should
work
i
do
work
and
hunt
go
out
and
show
yourself
to
everybody
if
i
could
break
my
neck
i
would
do
let
every
farmer
son
in
the
county
say
that
lawrence
twentyman
was
so
mastered
by
a
girl
that
he
could
ride
on
horseback
when
she
said
him
nay
everybody
knows
it
mr
masters
go
among
them
as
if
nobody
knew
it
i
warrant
that
nobody
will
speak
of
it
i
do
think
any
one
of
would
dare
to
do
that
said
larry
brandishing
his
stick
where
is
it
that
the
hounds
are
larry
here
at
the
old
kennel
go
out
and
let
her
see
that
you
have
taken
her
advice
she
is
there
at
the
house
and
she
will
recognise
you
in
the
park
remember
that
she
sends
her
love
to
you
and
bids
you
be
a
man
and
larry
come
in
and
see
us
sometimes
the
time
will
come
i
do
doubt
when
you
and
the
squire
will
be
fast
friends
never
you
do
not
know
what
time
can
do
i
just
go
back
now
because
he
is
to
come
to
me
this
afternoon
try
and
bear
up
and
remember
that
it
is
she
who
bids
you
be
a
man
the
attorney
got
upon
his
pony
and
rode
back
to
dillsborough
larry
who
had
come
back
to
the
yard
to
see
his
friend
off
returned
by
the
road
into
the
fields
and
went
wandering
about
for
a
while
in
dillsborough
wood
bid
him
be
a
man
was
he
a
man
was
it
disgraceful
to
him
as
a
man
to
be
because
a
woman
would
not
love
him
if
he
were
provoked
he
would
fight
perhaps
better
than
ever
because
he
would
be
reckless
would
he
not
be
ready
to
fight
reginald
morton
with
any
weapon
which
could
be
thought
of
for
the
possession
of
mary
masters
if
she
were
in
danger
would
he
not
go
down
into
the
deep
or
through
fire
to
save
her
were
not
his
old
instincts
of
honesty
and
truth
as
strong
in
him
as
ever
did
manliness
require
that
his
heart
should
be
invulnerable
if
so
he
doubted
whether
he
could
ever
be
a
man
but
what
if
she
meant
that
manliness
required
him
to
hide
the
wound
then
there
did
come
upon
him
a
feeling
of
shame
as
he
remembered
how
often
he
had
spoken
of
his
love
to
those
who
were
little
better
than
strangers
to
him
and
thought
that
perhaps
such
loquacity
was
opposed
to
the
manliness
which
she
recommended
and
his
conscience
smote
him
as
it
brought
to
his
recollection
the
condition
of
his
mind
as
he
woke
in
runciman
bed
at
the
bush
on
last
sunday
morning
that
at
any
rate
had
not
been
manly
how
would
it
be
with
him
if
he
made
up
his
mind
never
to
speak
again
to
her
and
certainly
not
to
him
and
to
take
care
that
that
should
be
the
only
sign
left
of
his
suffering
he
would
hunt
and
be
keener
than
ever
he
would
work
upon
the
land
with
increased
diligence
he
would
give
himself
not
a
moment
to
think
of
anything
she
should
see
and
hear
what
he
could
do
but
he
would
never
speak
to
her
again
the
hounds
would
be
at
the
old
kennels
he
would
be
there
the
place
no
doubt
was
property
but
on
hunting
mornings
all
the
lands
of
the
county
and
of
the
next
counties
if
they
can
be
reached
are
the
property
of
the
hunt
yes
he
would
be
there
and
she
would
see
him
in
his
scarlet
coat
and
smartest
cravat
with
his
boots
and
breeches
neat
as
those
of
lord
rufford
and
she
should
know
that
he
was
doing
as
she
bade
him
but
he
would
never
speak
to
her
again
as
he
was
returning
round
the
wood
whom
should
he
see
skulking
round
the
corner
of
it
but
goarly
what
business
have
you
in
here
he
said
feeling
to
take
the
man
by
the
neck
and
drag
him
out
of
the
copse
i
saw
you
twentyman
and
i
wanted
just
to
have
a
word
with
you
you
are
the
biggest
rascal
in
all
rufford
said
larry
i
wonder
the
lads
have
left
you
with
a
whole
bone
in
your
skin
what
have
i
done
worse
than
any
other
poor
man
twentyman
when
i
took
them
herrings
i
did
know
there
was
and
if
i
took
another
would
i
am
going
to
cut
it
out
of
this
mr
twentyman
may
the
go
along
with
you
said
larry
wishing
his
neighbour
a
very
unpleasant
companion
and
of
course
i
must
sell
the
place
think
what
it
would
be
to
you
i
should
like
it
to
go
into
his
lordship
hands
it
all
through
bean
i
know
but
his
lordship
has
had
a
down
on
me
ever
since
he
came
to
the
property
it
as
true
as
true
about
my
old
woman
geese
there
forty
acres
of
it
what
would
you
say
to
an
acre
the
idea
of
having
the
two
extra
fields
made
larry
mouth
water
in
spite
of
all
his
misfortunes
the
desire
for
land
among
such
as
larry
twentyman
is
almost
a
disease
in
england
with
these
two
fields
he
would
be
able
to
walk
almost
round
dillsborough
wood
without
quitting
his
own
property
he
had
been
talking
of
selling
chowton
within
the
last
week
or
two
he
had
been
thinking
of
selling
it
at
the
moment
when
masters
rode
up
to
him
and
yet
now
he
was
almost
tempted
to
a
new
purchase
by
this
man
but
the
man
was
too
utterly
a
blackguard
was
too
odious
to
him
if
it
comes
into
the
market
i
may
bid
for
it
as
well
as
another
he
said
but
i
would
let
myself
down
to
have
any
dealings
with
you
then
larry
you
shall
never
have
a
sod
of
it
said
goarly
dropping
himself
over
the
fence
on
to
his
own
field
a
few
minutes
afterwards
larry
met
bean
and
told
him
that
goarly
had
been
in
the
wood
if
i
catch
him
twentyman
i
give
him
sore
bones
said
bean
i
wonder
how
he
ever
got
back
to
his
own
place
alive
that
day
then
bean
asked
larry
whether
he
meant
to
be
at
the
meet
and
larry
said
that
he
thought
he
should
almost
afraid
to
bring
them
in
even
yet
said
bean
but
if
a
herring
left
in
this
wood
i
eat
it
myself
strychnine
and
all
after
that
larry
went
and
looked
at
his
horses
and
absolutely
gave
his
mare
bicycle
a
gallop
round
the
big
grass
field
himself
then
those
who
were
about
the
place
knew
that
something
had
happened
and
that
he
was
in
a
way
to
be
cured
you
hunt
wo
you
larry
said
his
mother
affectionately
who
told
you
nobody
told
me
but
you
will
larry
wo
you
may
be
i
will
then
as
he
was
leaving
the
room
when
he
was
in
the
so
that
she
should
not
see
his
face
he
told
her
the
news
she
going
to
marry
the
squire
yonder
mary
masters
i
always
hated
him
from
the
first
moment
i
saw
him
what
do
you
expect
from
a
fellow
who
never
gets
of
a
horse
then
he
turned
away
and
was
not
seen
again
till
long
after
chapter
xix
is
it
tanti
reginald
morton
entertained
serious
thoughts
of
cleansing
himself
from
the
reproach
which
larry
cast
upon
him
when
describing
his
character
to
his
mother
i
think
i
shall
take
to
hunting
he
said
to
mary
but
you
tumble
off
dear
no
doubt
i
shall
and
i
must
try
to
begin
in
soft
places
i
see
why
i
should
do
it
gradually
in
a
small
way
i
should
ever
become
a
nimrod
like
lord
rufford
or
your
particular
friend
mr
twentyman
he
is
my
particular
friend
so
i
perceive
i
could
shine
as
he
shines
but
i
might
gradually
learn
to
ride
after
him
at
a
respectful
distance
a
man
at
rome
ought
to
do
as
the
romans
do
why
was
hoppet
hall
rome
as
much
as
bragton
well
it
was
while
fortune
enabled
me
to
be
happy
at
hoppet
hall
that
is
unkind
reg
while
fortune
oppressed
me
with
celibate
misery
at
hoppet
hall
nobody
hated
me
for
not
hunting
and
as
i
could
not
very
well
afford
it
i
was
not
considered
to
be
entering
a
protest
against
the
amusement
as
it
is
now
i
find
that
unless
i
consent
to
risk
my
neck
at
any
rate
five
or
six
times
every
winter
i
shall
be
regarded
in
that
light
i
would
be
frightened
into
doing
anything
i
did
like
said
mary
how
do
you
know
that
i
sha
like
it
the
truth
is
i
have
had
a
letter
this
morning
from
a
benevolent
philosopher
which
has
almost
settled
the
question
for
me
he
wants
me
to
join
a
society
for
the
suppression
of
british
sports
as
being
barbarous
and
antipathetic
to
the
intellectual
pursuits
of
an
educated
man
i
would
immediately
shoot
fish
hunt
and
go
out
ratting
if
i
could
hope
for
the
least
success
i
know
i
should
never
shoot
anything
but
the
dog
and
the
gamekeepers
and
that
i
should
catch
every
weed
in
the
river
but
i
think
that
in
the
process
of
seasons
i
might
jump
over
a
hedge
kate
will
show
you
the
way
to
do
that
with
kate
and
twentyman
to
help
me
and
a
judicious
system
of
liberal
tips
to
tony
tuppett
i
could
make
my
way
about
on
a
quiet
old
nag
and
live
respected
by
my
neighbours
the
fact
is
i
hate
with
my
whole
heart
the
trash
of
the
philanimalist
what
is
a
a
i
did
quite
catch
the
thing
you
hate
the
thing
is
a
small
knot
of
people
who
think
that
they
possess
among
them
all
the
bowels
of
the
world
possess
all
the
what
reginald
i
said
bowels
using
an
ordinary
but
very
metaphor
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
to
whom
i
allude
not
looking
very
clearly
into
the
systems
of
pains
and
pleasures
in
accordance
with
which
we
have
to
live
put
their
splay
feet
down
now
upon
this
ordinary
operation
and
now
upon
that
and
call
upon
the
world
to
curse
the
cruelty
of
those
who
will
not
agree
with
them
a
lady
whose
tippet
is
made
from
the
skins
of
twenty
animals
who
have
been
wired
in
the
snow
and
then
left
to
die
of
starvation
oh
reginald
that
is
the
way
of
it
i
am
not
now
saying
whether
it
is
right
or
wrong
the
lady
with
the
tippet
will
justify
the
wires
and
the
starvation
because
as
she
will
say
she
uses
the
fur
an
honest
blanket
would
keep
her
just
as
warm
but
the
fox
who
suffers
perhaps
ten
minutes
of
agony
should
he
not
succeed
as
he
usually
does
in
getting
away
is
hunted
only
for
amusement
it
is
true
that
the
one
fox
gives
amusement
for
hours
to
perhaps
some
hundred
but
it
is
only
for
amusement
what
riles
me
most
is
that
these
philosophers
do
not
or
will
not
see
that
recreation
is
as
necessary
to
the
world
as
clothes
or
food
and
the
providing
of
the
one
is
as
legitimate
a
business
as
the
purveying
of
the
other
people
must
eat
and
wear
clothes
and
practically
they
must
be
amused
they
ignore
the
great
doctrine
of
i
never
heard
of
it
you
shall
dear
some
day
it
is
the
doctrine
by
which
you
should
regulate
everything
you
do
and
every
word
you
utter
now
do
you
and
kate
put
on
your
hats
and
we
walk
to
the
bridge
this
preaching
of
a
sermon
took
place
after
breakfast
at
bragton
on
the
morning
of
saturday
and
the
last
order
had
reference
to
a
scheme
they
had
on
foot
to
see
the
meet
at
the
old
kennels
on
the
previous
afternoon
reginald
morton
had
come
into
dillsborough
and
had
very
quietly
settled
everything
with
the
attorney
having
made
up
his
mind
to
do
the
thing
he
was
very
quick
in
the
doing
of
it
he
hated
the
idea
of
secrecy
in
such
an
affair
and
when
masters
asked
him
whether
he
had
any
objection
to
have
the
marriage
talked
about
expressed
his
willingness
that
she
should
employ
the
town
crier
to
make
it
public
if
she
thought
it
expedient
oh
morton
how
very
funny
you
are
said
the
lady
quite
in
earnest
masters
he
replied
then
he
kissed
the
two
girls
who
were
to
be
his
sisters
and
finished
the
visit
by
carrying
off
the
younger
to
spend
a
day
or
two
with
her
sister
at
bragton
i
know
he
said
whispering
to
mary
as
he
left
the
front
door
that
i
ought
not
to
go
out
hunting
so
soon
after
my
poor
cousin
death
but
as
he
was
a
cousin
once
removed
i
believe
i
may
walk
as
far
as
the
bridge
without
giving
offence
when
they
were
there
they
saw
all
the
arrivals
just
as
they
were
seen
on
the
same
spot
a
few
months
earlier
by
a
very
different
party
mary
and
kate
stood
on
the
bridge
together
while
he
remained
a
little
behind
leaning
on
the
stile
she
poor
girl
had
felt
some
shame
in
showing
herself
knowing
that
some
who
were
present
would
have
heard
of
her
engagement
and
that
others
would
be
told
of
it
as
soon
as
she
was
seen
are
you
ashamed
of
what
you
are
going
to
do
he
asked
ashamed
i
do
suppose
that
there
is
a
girl
in
england
so
proud
as
i
am
at
this
minute
i
do
know
that
there
is
anything
to
be
proud
of
but
if
you
are
not
ashamed
why
should
you
show
yourself
marriage
is
an
honourable
state
she
could
only
pinch
his
arm
and
do
as
he
bade
her
glomax
in
his
tandem
and
lord
rufford
in
his
drag
were
rather
late
first
there
came
one
or
two
hunting
men
out
of
the
town
runciman
nupper
and
the
hunting
saddler
then
there
arrived
henry
stubbings
with
a
string
of
horses
mounted
by
little
boys
ready
for
his
customers
and
full
of
wailing
to
his
friend
runciman
here
was
nearly
the
end
of
march
and
the
money
he
had
seen
since
christmas
was
little
more
as
he
declared
than
what
he
could
put
into
his
eye
and
see
none
the
worse
charge
ten
per
cent
interest
said
runciman
then
they
thinks
they
can
carry
on
for
another
year
said
stubbings
despondingly
while
this
was
going
on
larry
walked
his
favourite
mare
bicycle
on
to
the
ground
dressed
with
the
utmost
care
but
looking
very
moody
almost
fierce
as
though
he
did
not
wish
anybody
to
speak
to
him
tony
tuppett
who
had
known
him
since
a
boy
nodded
at
him
affectionately
and
said
how
glad
he
was
to
see
him
but
even
this
was
displeasing
to
larry
he
did
not
see
the
girls
on
the
bridge
but
took
up
his
place
near
them
he
was
thinking
so
much
of
his
own
unhappiness
and
of
what
he
believed
others
would
say
of
him
that
he
saw
almost
nothing
there
he
sat
on
his
mare
carrying
out
the
purpose
to
which
he
had
been
led
by
mary
message
but
wishing
with
all
his
heart
that
he
was
back
again
hidden
within
his
own
house
at
the
other
side
of
the
wood
mary
as
soon
as
she
saw
him
blushed
up
to
her
eyes
then
turning
round
looked
with
wistful
eyes
into
the
face
of
the
man
she
was
engaged
to
marry
and
with
rapid
step
walked
across
the
bridge
up
to
the
side
of
larry
horse
and
spoke
to
him
with
her
sweet
low
voice
larry
she
said
he
turned
round
to
her
very
quickly
showing
how
much
he
was
startled
then
she
put
up
her
hand
to
him
and
of
course
he
took
it
larry
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
did
papa
give
you
a
message
yes
miss
masters
he
told
me
i
know
it
all
say
a
kind
word
to
me
larry
i
i
i
you
know
very
well
what
in
my
mind
though
it
were
to
kill
me
i
should
wish
you
well
i
hope
you
have
a
good
hunt
larry
then
she
retired
back
to
the
bridge
and
again
looked
to
her
lover
to
know
whether
he
would
approve
there
were
so
few
there
and
larry
had
been
so
far
apart
from
the
others
that
she
was
sure
no
one
had
heard
the
few
words
which
had
passed
between
them
nor
could
anyone
have
observed
what
she
had
done
unless
it
were
old
nupper
or
runciman
or
tony
tuppett
but
yet
she
thought
that
it
perhaps
was
bold
and
that
he
would
be
angry
but
he
came
up
to
her
and
placing
himself
between
her
and
kate
whispered
into
her
ear
bravely
done
my
girl
after
a
little
i
will
try
to
be
as
brave
but
i
could
never
do
it
as
well
larry
in
the
meantime
had
moved
his
mare
away
and
before
the
master
had
arrived
was
walking
slowly
up
his
own
road
to
chowton
farm
the
captain
was
soon
there
and
lord
rufford
with
his
friends
and
harry
stubbings
string
and
tony
were
set
in
motion
but
before
they
stirred
there
was
a
consultation
to
which
bean
the
gamekeeper
was
called
as
to
the
safety
of
dillsborough
wood
dillsborough
wood
had
not
been
drawn
yet
since
scrobby
poison
had
taken
effect
on
the
old
fox
and
there
were
some
few
who
affected
to
think
that
there
still
might
be
danger
among
these
was
the
master
himself
who
asked
fred
botsey
with
a
sneer
whether
he
thought
that
such
hounds
as
those
were
to
be
picked
up
at
every
corner
but
bean
again
offered
to
eat
any
herring
that
might
be
there
poison
included
and
lord
rufford
laughed
at
the
danger
it
no
use
my
having
foxes
glomax
if
you
wo
draw
the
cover
this
the
lord
said
with
a
touch
of
anger
and
the
lord
anger
if
really
roused
might
be
injurious
it
was
therefore
decided
that
the
hounds
should
again
be
put
through
the
bragton
shrubberies
just
for
compliment
to
the
new
squire
and
that
then
they
should
go
off
to
dillsborough
wood
as
rapidly
as
might
be
larry
walked
his
beast
all
the
way
up
home
very
slowly
and
getting
off
her
put
her
into
the
stable
and
went
into
the
house
is
anything
wrong
asked
the
mother
everything
is
wrong
then
he
stood
with
his
back
to
the
kitchen
fire
for
nearly
half
an
hour
without
speaking
a
word
he
was
trying
to
force
himself
to
follow
out
her
idea
of
manliness
and
telling
himself
that
it
was
impossible
the
first
tone
of
her
voice
the
first
glance
at
her
face
had
driven
him
home
why
had
she
called
him
larry
again
and
again
so
tenderly
in
that
short
moment
and
looked
at
him
with
those
loving
eyes
then
he
declared
to
himself
without
uttering
a
word
that
she
did
not
understand
anything
about
it
she
did
not
comprehend
the
fashion
of
his
love
when
she
thought
as
she
did
think
that
a
soft
word
would
be
compensation
he
looked
round
to
see
if
his
mother
or
the
servant
were
there
and
when
he
found
that
the
coast
was
clear
he
dashed
his
hands
to
his
eyes
and
knocked
away
the
tears
he
threw
up
both
his
arms
and
groaned
and
then
he
remembered
her
message
bid
him
be
a
man
at
that
moment
he
heard
the
sound
of
horses
and
going
near
the
window
so
as
to
be
hidden
from
curious
eyes
as
they
passed
he
saw
the
first
whip
trot
on
with
the
hounds
after
him
and
tony
tuppett
among
them
then
there
was
a
long
string
of
horsemen
all
moving
up
to
the
wood
and
a
carriage
or
two
and
after
them
the
stragglers
of
the
field
he
let
them
all
go
by
and
then
he
repeated
the
words
again
bid
him
be
a
man
he
took
up
his
hat
jammed
it
on
his
head
and
went
out
into
the
yard
as
he
crossed
to
the
stables
runciman
came
up
alone
why
larry
you
be
late
he
said
go
on
runciman
i
follow
i
wait
till
you
are
mounted
you
be
better
for
somebody
with
you
you
got
the
mare
have
you
you
show
some
of
them
your
heels
if
they
get
away
from
here
is
she
as
fast
as
she
was
last
year
do
you
think
upon
my
word
i
do
know
said
larry
as
he
dragged
himself
into
the
saddle
shake
yourself
old
fellow
and
do
carry
on
like
that
what
is
she
after
all
but
a
girl
the
poor
fellow
looked
at
his
intending
comforter
but
could
speak
a
word
a
man
should
let
hisself
be
put
upon
by
circumstances
so
as
to
be
only
half
hisself
hang
it
man
cheer
up
and
do
let
see
you
going
about
like
that
it
ai
what
a
fellow
of
your
kidney
ought
to
be
if
they
have
found
i
a
nigger
and
by
the
holy
he
away
come
along
larry
and
forget
the
petticoats
for
half
an
hour
so
saying
runciman
broke
into
a
gallop
and
larry
mare
doing
the
same
he
soon
passed
the
innkeeper
and
was
up
at
the
covert
side
just
as
tony
tuppett
with
half
a
score
of
hounds
round
him
was
forcing
his
way
through
the
bushes
out
of
the
coverts
into
the
open
field
there
ai
no
poison
this
time
twentyman
said
the
huntsman
as
setting
his
eye
on
a
gap
in
the
further
fence
he
made
his
way
across
the
field
the
fox
headed
away
for
a
couple
of
miles
towards
impington
as
was
the
custom
with
the
dillsborough
foxes
and
then
turning
to
the
left
was
soon
over
the
country
borders
into
ufford
the
pace
from
the
first
starting
was
very
good
larry
under
such
provocation
as
that
of
course
would
ride
and
he
did
ride
up
as
far
as
the
country
brook
many
were
well
up
the
land
was
no
longer
deep
and
as
the
field
had
not
been
scattered
at
the
starting
all
the
men
who
usually
rode
were
fairly
well
placed
as
they
came
to
the
brook
but
it
was
acknowledged
afterwards
that
larry
was
over
it
the
first
glomax
got
into
it
as
he
always
does
into
brooks
and
young
runce
hurt
his
horse
shoulder
at
the
opposite
bank
lord
rufford
horse
balked
it
to
the
lord
disgust
but
took
it
afterwards
not
losing
very
much
ground
tony
went
in
and
out
the
crafty
old
dog
knowing
the
one
bit
of
hard
ground
then
they
crossed
purbeck
field
as
it
is
still
called
which
twenty
years
since
was
a
wide
waste
of
land
but
is
now
divided
by
new
fences
very
grievous
to
horses
sir
john
purefoy
got
a
nasty
fall
over
some
stiff
timber
and
here
many
a
rider
turned
to
the
right
into
the
lane
hampton
and
his
lordship
and
battersby
with
fred
botsey
and
larry
took
it
all
as
it
came
but
through
it
all
not
one
of
them
could
give
larry
a
lead
then
there
was
manoeuvring
into
a
wood
and
out
of
it
again
and
that
saddest
of
all
sights
to
the
riding
man
a
cloud
of
horsemen
on
the
road
as
well
placed
as
though
they
had
ridden
the
line
throughout
in
getting
out
of
the
road
hampton
horse
slipped
up
with
him
and
though
he
saw
it
all
he
was
never
able
again
to
compete
for
a
place
the
fox
went
through
the
hampton
wick
coverts
without
hanging
a
moment
just
throwing
the
hounds
for
two
minutes
off
their
scent
at
the
gravel
pits
the
check
was
very
useful
to
tony
who
had
got
his
second
horse
and
came
up
sputtering
begging
the
field
for
g
sake
to
be
in
short
to
be
anywhere
but
where
they
were
then
they
were
off
again
down
the
hill
to
the
left
through
mappy
springs
and
along
the
top
of
ilveston
copse
every
yard
of
which
is
grass
till
the
number
began
to
be
select
at
last
in
a
turnip
field
three
yards
from
the
fence
they
turned
him
over
and
tony
as
he
jumped
off
his
horse
among
the
hounds
acknowledged
to
himself
that
larry
might
have
had
his
hand
first
upon
the
animal
had
he
cared
to
do
so
twentyman
i
give
you
two
hundred
for
your
mare
said
lord
rufford
ah
my
lord
there
are
two
things
that
would
about
kill
me
what
are
they
larry
asked
harry
stubbings
to
offend
his
lordship
or
to
part
with
the
mare
you
shall
do
neither
said
lord
rufford
but
upon
my
word
i
think
she
the
fastest
thing
in
this
county
all
of
which
did
not
cure
poor
larry
but
it
helped
to
enable
him
to
be
a
man
the
fox
had
been
killed
close
to
norrington
and
the
run
was
remembered
with
intense
gratification
for
many
a
long
day
after
it
that
kind
of
thing
that
makes
hunting
beat
everything
else
said
lord
rufford
as
he
went
home
that
day
sport
certainly
had
been
tanti
and
glomax
and
the
two
counties
boasted
of
it
for
the
next
three
years
chapter
xx
benedict
lady
penwether
declared
to
her
husband
that
she
had
never
seen
her
brother
so
much
cowed
as
he
had
been
by
miss
trefoil
visit
to
rufford
it
was
not
only
that
he
was
unable
to
assert
his
usual
powers
immediately
after
the
attack
made
upon
him
but
that
on
the
following
day
at
scrobby
trial
on
the
saturday
when
he
started
to
the
meet
and
on
the
sunday
following
when
he
allowed
himself
to
be
easily
persuaded
to
go
to
church
he
was
silent
sheepish
and
evidently
afraid
of
himself
it
is
a
great
pity
that
we
take
the
ball
at
the
hop
she
said
to
sir
george
what
ball
and
what
hop
get
him
to
settle
himself
there
ought
to
be
an
end
to
this
kind
of
thing
now
he
has
got
out
of
this
mess
but
every
time
it
becomes
worse
and
worse
and
he
be
taken
in
horribly
by
some
harpy
if
we
do
get
him
to
marry
decently
i
fancy
he
was
very
nearly
going
in
this
last
affair
sir
george
in
this
matter
did
not
quite
agree
with
his
wife
it
was
in
his
opinion
right
to
avoid
miss
trefoil
but
he
did
not
see
why
his
should
be
precipitated
into
matrimony
with
miss
penge
according
to
his
ideas
in
such
matters
a
man
should
be
left
alone
therefore
as
was
customary
with
him
when
he
opposed
his
wife
he
held
his
tongue
you
have
been
called
in
three
or
four
times
when
he
has
been
just
on
the
edge
of
the
cliff
i
do
know
that
that
is
any
reason
why
he
should
be
pushed
over
there
is
not
a
word
to
be
said
against
caroline
she
has
a
fine
fortune
of
her
own
and
some
of
the
best
blood
in
the
kingdom
but
if
your
brother
does
not
care
for
her
that
nonsense
george
as
for
liking
it
all
the
same
to
him
rufford
is
and
easily
pleased
and
can
like
any
woman
caroline
is
very
a
great
deal
handsomer
than
that
horrid
creature
ever
was
and
with
manners
fit
for
any
position
i
no
reason
to
wish
to
force
a
wife
on
him
but
of
course
marry
and
unless
he
guided
he
certainly
marry
badly
is
miss
penge
in
love
with
him
asked
sir
george
in
a
tone
of
voice
that
was
intended
to
be
provoking
his
wife
looked
at
him
asking
him
plainly
by
her
countenance
whether
he
was
such
a
fool
as
that
was
it
likely
that
any
untitled
young
lady
of
should
be
wanting
in
the
capacity
of
being
in
love
with
a
young
lord
handsome
and
possessed
of
forty
thousand
a
year
without
encumbrances
sir
george
though
he
did
not
approve
was
not
eager
enough
in
his
disapproval
to
lay
any
serious
embargo
on
his
wife
proceedings
the
first
steps
taken
were
in
the
direction
of
the
hero
personal
comfort
he
was
flattered
and
petted
as
his
sister
knew
how
to
flatter
and
pet
him
and
miss
penge
in
a
quiet
way
assisted
lady
penwether
in
the
operation
for
a
day
or
two
he
had
not
much
to
say
for
himself
but
every
word
he
did
say
was
an
oracle
his
horses
were
spoken
of
as
demigods
and
his
projected
fishing
operations
for
june
and
july
became
matters
of
most
intense
interest
evil
things
were
said
of
arabella
trefoil
but
in
all
the
evil
things
said
no
hint
was
given
that
lord
rufford
had
behaved
badly
or
had
been
in
danger
lady
penwether
not
quite
knowing
the
state
of
his
mind
thought
that
there
might
still
be
some
lurking
affection
for
the
young
lady
did
you
ever
see
anybody
look
so
vulgar
and
hideous
as
she
did
when
she
marched
across
the
park
asked
lady
penwether
thank
goodness
i
did
not
see
her
said
miss
penge
i
never
saw
her
look
so
handsome
as
when
she
came
up
to
me
said
lord
rufford
but
such
a
thing
to
do
awful
said
miss
penge
she
is
the
pluckiest
girl
i
ever
came
across
in
my
life
said
lord
rufford
he
knew
very
well
what
they
were
at
and
was
already
almost
inclined
to
think
that
they
might
as
well
be
allowed
to
have
their
way
miss
penge
was
ladylike
quiet
and
good
and
was
like
a
cool
salad
in
a
man
mouth
after
spiced
meat
and
the
money
would
enable
him
to
buy
the
purefoy
property
which
would
probably
be
soon
in
the
market
but
he
felt
that
he
might
as
well
give
them
a
little
trouble
before
he
allowed
himself
to
be
hooked
it
certainly
was
not
by
any
arrangement
of
his
own
that
he
found
himself
walking
alone
with
miss
penge
that
sunday
afternoon
in
the
park
nor
did
it
seem
to
be
by
hers
he
thought
of
that
other
sunday
at
mistletoe
when
he
had
been
compelled
to
wander
with
arabella
when
he
met
the
duchess
and
when
as
he
often
told
himself
a
little
more
or
a
little
more
courage
on
her
grace
part
would
have
completed
the
work
entirely
certainly
had
the
duke
come
to
him
that
night
after
the
journey
from
stamford
he
would
have
capitulated
as
he
walked
along
and
allowed
himself
to
be
talked
to
by
miss
penge
he
did
tell
himself
that
she
would
be
the
better
angel
of
the
two
she
could
not
hunt
with
him
as
arabella
would
have
done
but
then
a
man
does
not
want
his
wife
to
gallop
across
the
country
after
him
she
might
perhaps
object
to
cigars
and
soda
water
after
eleven
but
then
what
assurance
had
he
that
arabella
would
not
have
objected
still
more
loudly
she
had
sworn
that
she
would
never
be
opposed
to
his
little
pleasures
but
he
knew
what
such
oaths
were
worth
marriage
altogether
was
a
bore
but
having
a
name
and
a
large
fortune
it
was
incumbent
on
him
to
transmit
them
to
an
immediate
descendant
and
perhaps
it
was
a
worse
bore
to
grow
old
without
having
specially
bound
any
other
human
being
to
his
interests
how
well
i
recollect
that
spot
said
miss
penge
it
was
there
that
major
caneback
took
the
fence
that
was
not
where
he
fell
oh
no
i
did
not
see
that
it
would
have
haunted
me
for
ever
had
i
done
so
but
it
was
there
that
i
thought
he
must
kill
himself
that
was
a
terrible
time
lord
rufford
terrible
to
poor
caneback
certainly
yes
and
to
all
of
us
do
you
remember
that
fearful
ball
we
were
all
so
unhappy
because
you
suffered
so
much
it
was
bad
and
that
woman
who
persecuted
you
we
all
knew
that
you
felt
it
i
felt
that
poor
man
death
yes
and
you
felt
the
other
nuisance
too
i
remember
that
you
told
me
that
you
would
cling
on
to
my
legs
eleanor
said
so
and
when
it
was
explained
to
me
what
clinging
on
to
your
legs
meant
i
remember
saying
that
i
wished
to
be
understood
as
being
one
to
help
i
love
your
sister
so
well
that
anything
which
would
break
her
heart
would
make
me
unhappy
you
did
not
care
for
my
own
welfare
in
the
matter
what
ought
i
say
lord
rufford
in
answer
to
that
of
course
i
did
care
but
i
knew
that
it
was
impossible
that
you
should
really
set
your
affections
on
such
a
person
as
miss
trefoil
i
told
eleanor
that
it
would
come
to
nothing
i
was
sure
of
it
why
should
it
have
come
to
nothing
as
you
call
it
because
you
are
a
gentleman
and
because
she
is
not
a
lady
i
know
that
we
women
can
quite
understand
how
it
is
that
you
men
amuse
yourselves
with
such
persons
i
did
amuse
myself
i
never
thought
you
did
very
much
there
was
something
i
suppose
in
her
riding
something
in
her
audacity
something
perhaps
in
her
vivacity
but
through
it
all
i
did
not
think
that
you
were
enjoying
yourself
you
may
be
sure
of
this
lord
rufford
that
when
a
woman
is
not
specially
liked
by
any
other
woman
she
ought
not
to
be
specially
liked
by
any
man
i
have
never
heard
that
miss
trefoil
had
a
female
friend
from
day
to
day
there
were
little
meetings
and
conversations
of
this
kind
till
lord
rufford
found
himself
accustomed
to
miss
solicitude
for
his
welfare
in
all
that
passed
between
them
the
lady
affected
a
status
that
was
altogether
removed
from
that
of
making
or
receiving
love
there
had
come
to
be
a
peculiar
friendship
because
of
eleanor
a
week
of
this
kind
of
thing
had
not
gone
by
before
miss
penge
found
herself
able
to
talk
of
and
absolutely
to
describe
this
peculiar
feeling
and
could
almost
say
how
pleasant
was
such
friendship
divested
of
the
burden
of
all
amatory
possibilities
but
through
it
all
lord
rufford
knew
that
he
would
have
to
marry
miss
penge
it
was
not
long
before
he
yielded
in
pure
weariness
who
has
not
felt
as
he
stood
by
a
stream
into
which
he
knew
that
it
was
his
fate
to
plunge
the
folly
of
delaying
the
shock
in
his
present
condition
he
had
no
ease
his
sister
threatened
him
with
a
return
of
arabella
miss
penge
required
from
him
sensational
conversation
his
was
laughing
at
him
in
his
sleeve
his
very
hunting
friends
treated
him
as
though
the
time
were
come
in
all
that
he
did
the
young
lady
took
an
interest
which
bored
him
excessively
to
put
an
end
to
which
he
only
saw
one
certain
way
he
therefore
asked
her
to
be
lady
rufford
before
he
got
on
his
drag
to
go
out
hunting
on
the
last
saturday
in
march
rufford
she
said
looking
up
into
his
face
with
her
lustrous
eyes
and
speaking
with
a
sweet
low
silvery
voice
are
you
sure
of
yourself
oh
yes
quite
sure
of
yourself
never
so
sure
in
my
life
then
dearest
dearest
rufford
i
will
not
scruple
to
say
that
i
also
am
sure
and
so
the
thing
was
settled
very
much
to
his
comfort
he
could
hardly
have
done
better
had
he
sought
through
all
england
for
a
bride
she
will
be
true
to
him
and
never
give
him
cause
for
a
moment
jealousy
she
will
like
his
title
his
house
and
his
property
she
will
never
spend
a
shilling
more
than
she
ought
to
do
she
will
look
very
sharply
after
him
but
will
not
altogether
debar
him
from
his
accustomed
pleasures
she
will
grace
his
table
nurse
his
children
and
never
for
a
moment
give
him
cause
to
be
ashamed
of
her
he
will
think
that
he
loves
her
and
after
a
lapse
of
ten
or
fifteen
years
will
probably
really
be
fond
of
her
from
the
moment
that
she
is
lady
rufford
she
will
love
him
as
she
loves
everything
that
is
her
own
in
spite
of
all
his
antecedents
no
one
doubted
his
faith
in
this
engagement
no
one
wished
to
hurry
him
very
much
when
the
proposition
had
been
made
and
accepted
and
when
the
hero
of
it
had
gone
off
on
his
drag
miss
penge
communicated
the
tidings
to
her
friend
i
think
he
has
behaved
very
wisely
said
lady
penwether
well
feeling
as
i
do
of
course
i
think
he
has
i
hope
he
thinks
the
same
of
me
i
had
many
doubts
about
it
but
i
do
believe
that
i
can
make
him
a
good
wife
lady
penwether
thought
that
her
friend
was
hardly
sufficiently
thankful
and
strove
to
tell
her
so
in
her
own
gentle
friendly
way
but
miss
penge
held
her
head
up
and
was
very
stout
and
would
not
acknowledge
any
cause
for
gratitude
lady
penwether
when
she
saw
how
it
was
to
be
gave
way
a
little
close
friendship
with
her
future
would
be
very
necessary
to
her
comfort
and
miss
penge
since
the
was
settled
had
never
been
given
to
yielding
my
dear
rufford
said
the
sister
affectionately
i
congratulate
you
with
all
my
heart
i
do
indeed
i
am
quite
sure
that
you
could
not
have
done
better
i
do
know
that
i
could
she
is
a
gem
of
inestimable
price
and
most
warmly
attached
to
you
and
if
this
property
is
to
be
bought
of
course
the
money
will
be
a
great
thing
money
is
always
comfortable
of
course
it
is
and
then
there
is
nothing
to
be
desired
if
i
had
named
the
girl
that
i
would
have
wished
you
to
love
it
would
have
been
caroline
penge
she
need
hardly
have
said
this
as
she
had
in
fact
been
naming
the
girl
for
the
last
three
or
four
months
the
news
was
soon
spread
about
the
country
and
the
fashionable
world
and
everybody
was
pleased
except
the
trefoil
family
chapter
xxi
arabella
success
when
arabella
trefoil
got
back
to
portugal
street
after
her
visit
to
rufford
she
was
ill
the
effort
she
had
made
the
unaccustomed
labour
and
the
necessity
of
holding
herself
aloft
before
the
man
who
had
rejected
her
were
together
more
than
her
strength
could
bear
and
she
was
taken
up
to
bed
in
a
fainting
condition
it
was
not
till
the
next
morning
that
she
was
able
even
to
open
the
letter
which
contained
the
news
of
john
morton
legacy
when
she
had
read
the
letter
and
realized
the
contents
she
took
to
weeping
in
a
fashion
very
unlike
her
usual
habits
she
was
still
in
bed
and
there
she
remained
for
two
or
three
days
during
which
she
had
time
to
think
of
her
past
life
and
to
think
also
a
little
of
the
future
old
green
came
to
her
once
or
twice
a
day
but
she
was
necessarily
left
to
the
nursing
of
her
own
maid
every
evening
mounser
green
called
and
sent
up
tender
enquiries
but
in
all
this
there
was
very
little
to
comfort
her
there
she
lay
with
the
letter
in
her
hand
thinking
that
the
only
man
who
had
endeavoured
to
be
of
service
to
her
was
he
whom
she
had
treated
with
unexampled
perfidy
other
men
had
petted
her
had
amused
themselves
with
her
and
then
thrown
her
over
had
lied
to
her
and
laughed
at
her
till
she
had
been
taught
to
think
that
a
man
was
a
heartless
cruel
slippery
animal
made
indeed
to
be
caught
occasionally
but
in
the
catching
of
which
infinite
skill
was
wanted
and
in
which
infinite
skill
might
be
thrown
away
but
this
man
had
been
true
to
her
to
the
last
in
spite
of
her
treachery
she
knew
that
she
was
heartless
herself
and
that
she
belonged
to
a
heartless
world
but
she
knew
also
that
there
was
a
world
of
women
who
were
not
heartless
such
women
had
looked
down
upon
her
as
from
a
great
height
but
she
in
return
had
been
able
to
ridicule
them
they
had
chosen
their
part
and
she
had
chosen
hers
and
had
thought
that
she
might
climb
to
the
glory
of
wealth
and
rank
while
they
would
have
to
marry
clergymen
and
briefless
barristers
she
had
often
been
called
upon
to
vindicate
to
herself
the
part
she
had
chosen
and
had
always
done
so
by
magnifying
in
her
own
mind
the
sin
of
the
men
with
whom
she
had
to
deal
at
this
moment
she
thought
that
lord
rufford
had
treated
her
villainously
whereas
her
conduct
to
him
had
been
only
that
which
the
necessity
of
the
case
required
to
lord
rufford
she
had
simply
behaved
after
the
manner
of
her
class
heartless
of
course
but
only
in
the
way
which
the
custom
of
the
trade
justified
each
had
tried
to
circumvent
the
other
and
she
as
the
weaker
had
gone
to
the
wall
but
john
morton
had
believed
in
her
and
loved
her
oh
how
she
wished
that
she
had
deserted
her
class
and
clung
to
him
even
though
she
should
now
have
been
his
widow
the
legacy
was
a
burden
to
her
even
she
had
conscience
enough
to
be
sorry
for
a
day
or
two
that
he
had
named
her
in
his
will
and
what
would
she
do
with
herself
for
the
future
her
quarrel
with
her
mother
had
been
very
serious
each
swearing
that
under
no
circumstances
would
she
again
consent
to
live
with
the
other
the
daughter
of
course
knew
that
the
mother
would
receive
her
again
should
she
ask
to
be
received
but
in
such
case
she
must
go
back
with
shortened
pinions
and
blunted
beak
her
sojourn
with
green
was
to
last
for
one
month
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
she
must
seek
for
a
home
if
she
put
john
morton
legacy
out
to
interest
she
would
now
be
mistress
of
a
small
income
but
she
understood
money
well
enough
to
know
to
what
obduracy
of
poverty
she
would
thus
be
subjected
as
she
looked
the
matter
closer
in
the
face
the
horrors
became
more
startling
and
more
manifest
who
would
have
her
in
their
houses
where
should
she
find
society
where
the
possibility
of
lovers
what
would
be
her
life
and
what
her
prospects
must
she
give
up
for
ever
the
game
for
which
she
had
lived
and
own
that
she
had
been
conquered
in
the
fight
and
beaten
even
to
death
then
she
thought
over
the
long
list
of
her
past
lovers
trying
to
see
whether
there
might
be
one
of
the
least
desirable
at
whom
she
might
again
cast
her
javelins
but
there
was
not
one
the
tender
messages
from
mounser
green
came
to
her
day
by
day
mounser
green
as
the
nephew
of
her
hostess
had
been
very
kind
to
her
but
hitherto
he
had
never
appeared
to
her
in
the
light
of
a
possible
lover
he
was
a
clerk
in
the
foreign
office
waiting
for
his
aunt
money
a
man
whom
she
had
met
in
society
and
whom
she
knew
to
be
well
thought
of
by
those
above
him
in
wealth
and
rank
but
she
had
never
regarded
him
as
prey
or
as
a
man
whom
any
girl
would
want
to
marry
he
was
one
of
those
of
the
other
sex
who
would
most
probably
look
out
for
prey
who
if
he
married
at
all
would
marry
an
heiress
she
in
her
time
had
been
on
good
terms
with
many
such
a
one
had
counted
them
among
her
intimate
friends
had
made
use
of
them
and
been
useful
to
them
but
she
had
never
dreamed
of
marrying
any
one
of
them
they
were
there
in
society
for
altogether
a
different
purpose
she
had
not
hesitated
to
talk
to
mounser
green
about
lord
rufford
and
though
she
had
pretended
to
make
a
secret
of
the
place
to
which
she
was
going
when
he
had
taken
her
to
the
railway
she
had
not
at
all
objected
to
his
understanding
her
purpose
up
to
that
moment
there
had
certainly
been
no
thought
on
her
part
of
transferring
what
she
was
wont
to
call
her
affections
to
mounser
green
as
a
suitor
but
as
she
lay
in
bed
thinking
of
her
future
life
tidings
were
brought
to
her
by
green
that
mounser
had
accepted
the
mission
to
patagonia
could
it
be
that
her
destiny
intended
her
to
go
out
to
patagonia
as
the
wife
if
not
of
one
minister
then
of
another
there
would
be
a
career
a
way
of
living
if
not
exactly
that
which
she
would
have
chosen
of
patagonia
as
a
place
of
residence
she
had
already
formed
ideas
in
some
of
those
moments
in
which
she
had
foreseen
that
lord
rufford
would
be
lost
to
her
she
had
told
herself
that
it
would
be
better
to
reign
in
hell
than
serve
in
heaven
among
patagonian
women
she
would
probably
be
the
first
among
english
ladies
it
did
not
seem
that
at
present
she
had
prospect
of
a
high
place
it
would
be
long
before
lord
rufford
would
be
forgotten
and
she
had
not
space
enough
before
her
for
forgettings
which
would
require
time
for
their
accomplishment
mounser
green
had
declared
with
energy
that
lord
rufford
had
behaved
very
badly
there
are
men
who
feel
it
to
be
their
mission
to
come
in
for
the
relief
of
ladies
who
have
been
badly
treated
if
mounser
green
wished
to
be
one
of
them
on
her
behalf
and
to
take
her
out
with
him
to
his
very
employment
might
not
this
be
the
best
possible
solution
of
her
present
difficulties
on
the
evening
of
the
third
day
after
her
return
she
was
able
to
come
and
the
line
of
thought
which
has
been
suggested
for
her
induced
her
to
undertake
some
trouble
with
the
white
and
pink
robe
or
in
which
she
had
appeared
well
my
dear
you
are
smart
the
old
lady
said
in
woollen
a
saint
provoke
were
the
last
words
which
poor
narcissa
spoke
said
arabella
who
had
long
since
provided
herself
with
this
quotation
for
such
occasions
i
hope
i
am
not
exactly
dying
green
but
i
do
see
why
i
should
not
object
to
be
as
well
as
the
young
lady
who
was
i
suppose
it
all
done
for
mounser
benefit
partly
for
you
partly
for
mounser
and
a
good
deal
for
myself
what
a
very
odd
name
why
did
they
call
him
mounser
i
used
to
think
it
was
because
he
was
in
the
foreign
office
a
kind
of
chaff
as
being
half
a
frenchman
my
mother
maiden
name
was
mounser
and
it
is
french
at
all
i
do
see
why
it
should
not
be
as
good
a
christian
name
as
willoughby
or
howard
quite
as
good
and
much
more
distinctive
there
ca
be
another
mounser
green
in
the
world
and
very
few
other
young
men
like
him
at
my
time
of
life
i
find
it
very
hard
his
going
away
and
what
will
he
do
in
such
a
place
as
that
all
alone
and
without
a
wife
why
do
you
make
him
take
a
wife
there
is
time
now
he
have
to
start
in
may
plenty
of
time
trousseaus
are
now
got
up
by
steam
and
girls
are
kept
ready
to
marry
at
the
shortest
notice
if
i
were
you
i
should
certainly
advise
him
to
take
out
some
healthy
young
woman
capable
of
bearing
the
inclemencies
of
the
patagonian
climate
as
for
that
the
climate
is
delicious
said
green
who
certainly
was
not
led
by
her
guest
manner
to
suspect
the
nature
of
her
guest
more
recent
intentions
mounser
green
on
this
afternoon
came
to
portugal
street
before
he
himself
went
out
to
dinner
choosing
the
hour
at
which
his
aunt
was
wont
to
adorn
herself
and
so
you
are
to
be
the
hero
of
patagonia
said
arabella
as
she
put
out
her
hand
to
congratulate
him
on
his
appointment
i
do
know
about
heroism
but
it
seems
that
i
am
to
go
there
said
mounser
with
much
melancholy
in
his
voice
i
should
have
thought
you
were
the
last
man
to
leave
london
willingly
well
yes
i
should
have
said
so
myself
and
i
do
flatter
myself
i
shall
be
missed
but
what
had
i
before
me
here
this
may
lead
to
something
indeed
you
will
be
missed
mr
green
it
very
kind
of
you
to
say
so
patagonia
it
is
such
a
long
way
off
then
she
began
to
consider
whether
he
had
ever
heard
of
her
engagement
with
the
last
to
that
country
that
he
should
know
all
about
lord
rufford
was
a
matter
of
course
but
what
chance
could
there
be
for
her
if
he
also
knew
that
other
affair
we
were
intimately
acquainted
with
morton
in
washington
and
were
surprised
that
he
should
have
accepted
it
poor
morton
he
was
a
friend
of
mine
we
used
to
call
him
the
paragon
because
he
never
made
mistakes
i
had
heard
that
you
and
lady
augusta
were
a
good
deal
with
him
in
washington
we
were
indeed
you
do
not
know
my
good
news
as
yet
i
suppose
your
paragon
as
you
call
him
has
left
me
five
thousand
pounds
of
course
it
would
be
necessary
that
he
should
know
it
some
day
if
this
new
plan
of
hers
were
to
be
carried
out
and
if
the
plan
should
fail
his
knowing
it
could
do
no
harm
how
very
nice
for
you
poor
morton
it
is
well
that
somebody
should
behave
well
when
others
treat
one
so
badly
green
yes
he
has
left
me
five
thousand
pounds
then
she
showed
him
the
lawyer
letter
perhaps
as
i
am
so
separated
at
present
from
all
my
own
people
by
this
affair
with
lord
rufford
you
would
not
mind
seeing
the
man
for
me
of
course
he
promised
to
see
the
lawyer
and
to
do
everything
that
was
necessary
the
truth
is
green
morton
was
very
warmly
attached
to
me
i
was
a
foolish
girl
and
could
not
return
it
i
thought
of
it
long
and
was
then
obliged
to
tell
him
that
i
could
not
entertain
just
that
sort
of
feeling
for
him
you
can
not
think
now
how
bitter
is
my
regret
that
i
should
have
allowed
myself
to
trust
a
man
so
false
and
treacherous
as
lord
rufford
and
that
i
should
have
perhaps
added
a
pang
to
the
deathbed
of
one
so
good
as
mr
morton
and
so
she
told
her
little
story
not
caring
very
much
whether
it
were
believed
or
not
but
finding
it
to
be
absolutely
essential
that
some
story
should
be
told
during
the
next
day
or
two
mounser
green
thought
a
great
deal
about
it
that
the
story
was
not
exactly
true
he
knew
very
well
but
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
a
girl
before
her
marriage
should
be
exactly
true
about
her
old
loves
that
she
had
been
engaged
to
lord
rufford
and
had
been
cruelly
jilted
by
him
he
did
believe
that
she
had
at
one
time
been
engaged
to
the
paragon
he
was
almost
sure
the
fact
that
the
paragon
had
left
her
money
was
a
strong
argument
that
she
had
not
behaved
badly
to
him
but
there
was
much
that
was
quite
certain
the
five
thousand
pounds
were
quite
certain
and
the
money
though
it
could
not
be
called
a
large
fortune
for
a
young
lady
would
pay
his
debts
and
send
him
out
a
free
man
to
patagonia
and
the
family
honours
were
certainly
true
she
was
the
undoubted
niece
of
the
duke
of
mayfair
and
such
a
connection
might
in
his
career
be
of
service
to
him
lord
mistletoe
was
a
prig
but
would
probably
be
a
member
of
the
government
mounser
green
liked
dukes
and
loved
a
duchess
in
his
heart
of
hearts
if
he
could
only
be
assured
that
this
niece
would
not
be
repudiated
he
thought
that
the
speculation
might
answer
in
spite
of
any
ambiguity
in
the
lady
antecedents
have
you
heard
about
arabella
good
fortune
young
glossop
asked
the
next
morning
at
the
office
you
forget
my
boy
said
mounser
green
that
the
young
lady
of
whom
you
speak
is
a
friend
of
mine
oh
lord
so
i
did
i
beg
your
pardon
old
fellow
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
room
at
the
moment
and
glossop
in
asking
the
question
had
in
truth
forgotten
what
he
had
heard
of
this
new
intimacy
do
you
learn
to
be
glossop
and
remember
that
there
is
no
form
so
bad
as
that
of
calling
young
ladies
by
their
christian
names
i
do
know
that
poor
morton
has
left
miss
trefoil
a
sum
of
money
which
is
at
any
rate
evidence
that
he
thought
well
of
her
to
the
last
of
course
it
is
i
did
mean
to
offend
you
i
would
do
it
for
worlds
as
you
are
going
away
that
afternoon
when
green
back
was
turned
glossop
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
something
particular
would
turn
up
between
mounser
and
miss
trefoil
an
opinion
which
brought
down
much
ridicule
upon
him
from
both
hoffmann
and
archibald
currie
but
before
that
week
was
over
in
the
early
days
of
april
they
were
forced
to
retract
their
opinion
and
to
do
honour
to
young
glossop
sagacity
mounser
green
was
engaged
to
miss
trefoil
and
for
a
day
or
two
the
foreign
office
could
talk
of
nothing
else
a
very
handsome
girl
said
lord
drummond
to
one
of
his
subordinates
i
met
her
at
mistletoe
as
to
that
affair
with
lord
rufford
he
treated
her
abominably
and
when
mounser
showed
himself
at
the
office
which
he
did
boldly
immediately
after
the
engagement
was
made
known
they
all
received
him
with
open
arms
and
congratulated
him
sincerely
on
his
happy
fortune
he
himself
was
quite
contented
with
what
he
had
done
and
thought
that
he
was
taking
out
for
himself
the
very
wife
for
patagonia
chapter
xxii
the
wedding
no
sooner
did
the
new
two
lovers
mounser
green
and
arabella
trefoil
understand
each
other
than
they
set
their
wits
to
work
to
make
the
best
of
their
natural
advantages
the
latter
communicated
the
fact
in
a
very
dry
manner
to
her
father
and
mother
nothing
was
to
be
got
from
them
and
it
was
only
just
necessary
that
they
should
know
what
she
intended
to
do
with
herself
my
dear
mamma
i
am
to
be
married
some
time
early
in
may
to
mounser
green
of
the
foreign
office
i
do
think
you
know
him
but
i
daresay
you
have
heard
of
him
he
goes
to
patagonia
immediately
after
the
wedding
and
i
shall
go
with
him
your
affectionate
daughter
arabella
trefoil
that
was
all
she
said
and
the
letter
to
her
father
was
word
for
word
the
same
but
how
to
make
use
of
those
friends
who
were
more
happily
circumstanced
was
matter
for
frequent
counsel
between
her
and
green
in
these
days
i
do
not
think
that
she
concealed
very
much
from
him
to
tell
him
all
the
little
details
of
her
adventures
with
lord
rufford
would
have
been
neither
useful
nor
pleasant
but
as
to
the
chief
facts
reticence
would
have
been
foolish
to
the
statement
that
lord
rufford
had
absolutely
proposed
to
her
she
clung
fast
and
really
did
believe
it
herself
that
she
had
been
engaged
to
john
morton
she
did
not
deny
but
she
threw
the
blame
of
that
matter
on
her
mother
and
explained
to
him
that
she
had
broken
off
the
engagement
down
at
bragton
because
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
regard
the
man
with
sufficient
personal
favour
mounser
was
satisfied
but
was
very
strong
in
urging
her
to
seek
yet
once
again
the
favour
of
her
magnificent
uncle
and
her
magnificent
aunt
what
good
can
they
do
us
said
arabella
who
was
almost
afraid
to
make
the
appeal
it
would
be
everything
for
you
to
be
married
from
mistletoe
he
said
people
would
know
then
that
you
were
not
blamed
about
lord
rufford
and
it
might
serve
me
very
much
in
my
profession
these
things
do
help
very
much
it
would
cost
us
nothing
and
the
proper
kind
of
notice
would
then
get
into
the
newspapers
if
you
will
write
direct
to
the
duchess
i
will
get
at
the
duke
through
lord
drummond
they
know
where
we
are
going
and
that
we
are
not
likely
to
want
anything
else
for
a
long
time
i
do
think
the
duchess
would
have
mamma
if
it
were
ever
so
then
we
must
drop
your
mother
for
the
time
that
all
when
my
aunt
hears
that
you
are
to
be
married
from
the
duke
she
will
be
quite
willing
that
you
should
remain
with
her
till
you
go
down
to
mistletoe
arabella
who
perhaps
knew
a
little
more
than
her
lover
could
not
bring
herself
to
believe
that
the
appeal
would
be
successful
but
she
made
it
it
was
a
very
difficult
letter
to
write
as
she
could
not
but
allude
to
the
rapid
transference
of
her
affections
i
will
not
conceal
from
you
she
said
that
i
have
suffered
very
much
from
lord
rufford
heartless
conduct
my
misery
has
been
aggravated
by
the
feeling
that
you
and
my
uncle
will
hardly
believe
him
to
be
so
false
and
will
attribute
part
of
the
blame
to
me
i
had
to
undergo
an
agonizing
revulsion
of
feeling
during
which
green
behaviour
to
me
was
at
first
so
considerate
and
then
so
kind
that
it
has
gone
far
to
cure
the
wound
from
which
i
have
been
suffering
he
is
so
well
known
in
reference
to
foreign
affairs
that
i
think
my
uncle
can
not
but
have
heard
of
him
my
cousin
mistletoe
is
certainly
acquainted
with
him
and
i
think
that
you
can
not
but
approve
of
the
match
you
know
what
is
the
position
of
my
father
and
my
mother
and
how
little
able
they
are
to
give
us
any
assistance
if
you
would
be
kind
enough
to
let
us
be
married
from
mistletoe
you
will
confer
on
both
of
us
a
very
very
great
favour
there
was
more
of
it
but
that
was
the
first
of
the
prayer
and
most
of
the
words
given
above
came
from
the
dictation
of
mounser
himself
she
had
pleaded
against
making
the
direct
request
but
he
had
assured
her
that
in
the
world
as
at
present
arranged
the
best
way
to
get
a
thing
is
to
ask
for
it
you
make
yourself
at
any
rate
understood
he
said
and
you
may
be
sure
that
people
who
receive
petitions
do
not
feel
the
hardihood
of
them
so
much
as
they
who
make
them
arabella
comforting
herself
by
declaring
that
the
duchess
at
any
rate
could
not
eat
her
wrote
the
letter
and
sent
it
the
duchess
at
first
was
most
serious
in
her
intention
to
refuse
she
was
indeed
made
very
angry
by
the
request
though
it
had
been
agreed
at
mistletoe
that
lord
rufford
had
behaved
badly
the
duchess
was
thoroughly
well
aware
that
arabella
conduct
had
been
abominable
lord
rufford
probably
had
made
an
offer
but
it
had
been
extracted
from
him
by
the
vilest
of
manoeuvres
the
girl
had
been
personally
insolent
to
herself
and
this
rapid
change
this
third
engagement
within
a
few
weeks
was
disgusting
to
her
as
a
woman
but
unluckily
for
herself
she
would
not
answer
the
letter
till
she
had
consulted
her
husband
as
it
happened
the
duke
was
in
town
and
while
he
was
there
lord
drummond
got
hold
of
him
lord
drummond
had
spoken
very
highly
of
mounser
green
and
the
duke
who
was
never
dead
to
the
feeling
that
as
the
head
of
the
family
he
should
always
do
what
he
could
for
the
junior
branches
had
almost
made
a
promise
i
never
take
such
things
upon
myself
he
said
but
if
the
duchess
has
no
objection
we
will
have
them
down
to
mistletoe
of
course
if
you
wish
it
said
the
duchess
with
more
acerbity
in
her
tone
than
the
duke
had
often
heard
there
wish
it
what
do
you
mean
by
wishing
it
it
will
be
a
great
bore
terrible
but
she
is
the
only
one
there
is
and
then
we
shall
have
done
with
it
done
with
it
they
will
be
back
from
patagonia
before
you
can
turn
yourself
and
then
of
course
we
must
have
them
here
drummond
tells
me
that
green
is
one
of
the
most
useful
men
they
have
at
the
foreign
office
just
the
man
that
one
ought
to
give
a
lift
to
of
course
the
duke
had
his
way
the
duchess
could
not
bring
herself
to
write
the
letter
but
the
duke
wrote
to
his
dear
niece
saying
that
they
would
be
very
glad
to
see
her
and
that
if
she
would
name
the
day
proposed
for
the
wedding
one
should
be
fixed
for
her
visit
to
mistletoe
you
had
better
tell
your
mother
and
your
father
mounser
said
to
her
what
the
use
the
duchess
hates
my
mother
and
my
father
never
goes
near
the
place
nevertheless
tell
them
people
care
a
great
deal
for
appearances
she
did
as
she
was
bid
and
the
result
was
that
lord
augustus
and
his
wife
on
the
occasion
of
their
daughter
marriage
met
each
other
at
mistletoe
for
the
first
time
for
the
last
dozen
years
before
the
day
came
round
arabella
was
quite
astonished
to
find
how
popular
and
fashionable
her
wedding
was
likely
to
be
and
how
the
world
at
large
approved
of
what
she
was
doing
the
newspapers
had
paragraphs
about
alliances
and
noble
families
and
all
the
relatives
sent
tribute
there
was
a
gold
candlestick
from
the
duke
a
gilt
dish
from
the
duchess
which
came
however
without
a
word
of
personal
congratulation
and
a
gorgeous
set
of
from
cousin
mistletoe
the
connop
greens
were
lavish
with
sapphires
the
de
brownes
with
pearls
and
the
smijths
with
opal
gore
sent
a
huge
carbuncle
which
arabella
strongly
suspected
to
be
glass
from
her
paternal
parent
there
came
a
pair
of
silver
and
from
the
maternal
a
newly
done
up
old
green
gave
her
a
couple
of
ornamental
and
innumerable
came
from
distant
greens
but
there
was
a
diamond
ring
with
a
single
stone
from
a
friend
without
a
name
which
she
believed
to
be
worth
all
the
rest
in
money
value
should
she
send
it
back
to
lord
rufford
or
make
a
gulp
and
swallow
it
how
invincible
must
be
the
of
the
man
when
he
could
send
her
such
a
present
after
such
a
rating
as
she
had
given
him
in
the
park
at
rufford
do
as
you
like
mounser
green
said
when
she
consulted
him
she
very
much
wished
to
keep
it
but
what
am
i
to
say
and
to
whom
write
a
note
to
the
jewellers
saying
that
you
have
got
it
she
did
write
to
the
jeweller
saying
that
she
had
got
the
ring
from
a
friend
and
the
ring
with
the
other
tribute
went
to
patagonia
he
had
certainly
behaved
very
badly
to
her
but
she
was
quite
sure
that
he
would
never
tell
the
story
of
the
ring
to
any
one
perhaps
she
thought
that
as
she
had
spared
him
in
the
great
matter
of
eight
thousand
pounds
she
was
entitled
to
take
this
smaller
contribution
it
was
late
in
april
when
she
went
down
to
mistletoe
the
marriage
having
been
fixed
for
the
of
may
after
that
they
were
to
spend
a
fortnight
in
paris
and
leave
england
for
patagonia
at
the
end
of
the
month
the
only
thing
which
arabella
dreaded
was
the
meeting
with
the
duchess
when
that
was
once
over
she
thought
that
she
could
bear
with
equanimity
all
that
could
come
after
the
week
before
her
marriage
could
not
be
a
pleasant
week
but
then
she
had
been
accustomed
to
endure
evil
hours
her
uncle
would
be
blandly
mistletoe
should
he
be
there
would
make
civil
speeches
to
compensate
for
his
indifference
when
called
upon
to
attack
lord
rufford
other
guests
would
tender
to
her
the
caressing
observance
always
shown
to
a
bride
but
as
she
got
out
of
the
ducal
carriage
at
the
front
door
her
heart
was
uneasy
at
the
coming
meeting
the
duchess
herself
almost
went
to
bed
when
the
time
came
so
much
did
she
dread
the
same
thing
she
was
quite
alone
having
felt
that
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
give
the
affectionate
embrace
which
the
presence
of
others
would
require
she
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
then
came
forward
three
steps
to
meet
the
bride
arabella
she
said
i
am
very
glad
that
everything
has
been
settled
so
comfortably
for
you
that
is
so
kind
of
you
aunt
said
arabella
who
was
watching
the
duchess
closely
ready
to
jump
into
her
aunt
arms
if
required
to
do
so
or
to
stand
quite
aloof
then
the
duchess
signified
her
pleasure
that
her
cheek
should
be
touched
and
it
was
touched
pepper
will
show
you
your
room
it
is
the
same
you
had
when
you
were
here
before
perhaps
you
know
that
green
comes
down
to
stamford
on
the
first
and
that
he
will
dine
here
on
that
day
and
on
sunday
that
will
be
very
nice
he
had
told
me
how
it
was
arranged
it
seems
that
he
knows
one
of
the
clergymen
in
stamford
and
will
stay
at
his
house
perhaps
you
will
like
to
go
upstairs
now
that
was
all
there
was
and
that
had
not
been
very
bad
during
the
entire
week
the
duchess
hardly
spoke
to
her
another
word
and
certainly
did
not
speak
to
her
a
word
in
private
arabella
now
could
go
where
she
pleased
without
any
danger
of
meeting
her
aunt
on
her
walks
when
sunday
came
nobody
asked
her
to
go
to
church
she
did
go
twice
mounser
green
accompanying
her
to
the
morning
service
but
there
was
no
restraint
the
duchess
only
thought
of
her
as
a
disagreeable
incubus
who
luckily
was
about
to
be
taken
away
to
patagonia
it
had
been
settled
on
all
sides
that
the
marriage
was
to
be
very
quiet
the
bride
was
of
course
consulted
about
her
bridesmaids
as
to
whom
there
was
a
little
difficulty
but
a
distant
trefoil
was
found
willing
to
act
in
payment
for
the
unaccustomed
invitation
to
mistletoe
and
one
connop
green
young
lady
with
one
de
browne
young
lady
and
one
smijth
young
lady
came
on
the
same
terms
arabella
herself
was
surprised
at
the
ease
with
which
it
was
all
done
on
the
saturday
lady
augustus
came
and
on
the
sunday
lord
augustus
the
parents
of
course
kissed
their
child
but
there
was
very
little
said
in
the
way
either
of
congratulation
or
farewell
lord
augustus
did
have
some
conversation
with
mounser
green
but
it
all
turned
on
the
probability
of
there
being
whist
in
patagonia
on
the
monday
morning
they
were
married
and
then
arabella
was
taken
off
by
the
happy
bridegroom
when
the
ceremony
was
over
it
was
expected
that
lady
augustus
should
take
herself
away
as
quickly
as
possible
not
perhaps
on
that
very
afternoon
but
at
any
rate
on
the
next
morning
as
soon
as
the
carriage
was
gone
she
went
to
her
own
room
and
wept
bitterly
it
was
all
done
now
everything
was
over
though
she
had
quarrelled
daily
with
her
daughter
for
the
last
twelve
years
to
such
an
extent
lately
that
no
decently
civil
word
ever
passed
between
them
still
there
had
been
something
to
interest
her
there
had
been
something
to
fear
and
something
to
hope
the
girl
had
always
had
some
prospect
before
her
more
or
less
brilliant
her
life
had
had
its
occupation
and
future
triumph
was
possible
now
it
was
all
over
the
link
by
which
she
had
been
bound
to
the
world
was
broken
the
connop
greens
and
the
smijths
would
no
longer
have
her
unless
it
might
be
on
short
and
special
occasions
as
a
great
favour
she
knew
that
she
was
an
old
woman
without
money
without
blood
and
without
attraction
whom
nobody
would
ever
again
desire
to
see
she
had
her
things
packed
up
and
herself
taken
off
to
london
almost
without
a
word
of
farewell
to
the
duchess
telling
herself
as
she
went
that
the
world
had
produced
no
other
people
so
heartless
as
the
family
of
the
trefoils
i
wonder
what
you
will
think
of
patagonia
said
mounser
green
as
he
took
his
bride
away
i
do
suppose
i
shall
think
much
as
far
as
i
can
see
one
place
is
always
like
another
but
then
you
will
have
duties
not
very
heavy
i
hope
then
he
preached
her
a
sermon
expressing
a
hope
as
he
went
on
that
as
she
was
leaving
the
pleasures
of
life
behind
her
she
would
learn
to
like
the
work
of
life
i
have
found
the
pleasures
very
hard
she
said
he
spoke
to
her
of
the
companion
he
hoped
to
find
of
the
possible
children
who
might
be
dependent
on
their
mother
of
the
position
which
she
would
hold
and
of
the
manner
in
which
she
should
fill
it
she
as
she
listened
to
him
was
almost
stunned
by
the
change
in
the
world
around
her
she
need
never
again
seem
to
be
gay
in
order
that
men
might
be
attracted
she
made
her
promises
and
made
them
with
an
intention
of
keeping
them
but
it
may
we
fear
be
doubted
whether
he
was
justified
in
expecting
that
he
could
get
a
wife
fit
for
his
purpose
out
of
the
school
in
which
arabella
trefoil
had
been
educated

will
pass
out
of

sight
and
we
can
only
hope
that
he
may
not
be
disappointed
chapter
xxiii
the
senator
no
wednesday
april
was
the
day
at
last
fixed
for
the
lecture
his
little
proposal
to
set
england
right
on
all
those
matters
in
which
she
had
hitherto
gone
astray
had
created
a
considerable
amount
of
attention
the
goarly
affair
with
the
subsequent
trial
of
scrobby
had
been
much
talked
about
and
the
senator
doings
in
reference
to
it
had
been
made
matter
of
comment
in
the
newspapers
some
had
praised
him
for
courage
benevolence
and
a
steadfast
purpose
others
had
ridiculed
his
inability
to
understand
manners
different
from
those
of
his
own
country
he
had
seen
a
good
deal
of
society
both
in
london
and
in
the
country
and
had
never
hesitated
to
express
his
opinions
with
an
audacity
which
some
had
called
insolence
when
he
had
trodden
with
his
whole
weight
hard
down
on
individual
corns
of
course
he
had
given
offence
as
on
the
memorable
occasion
of
the
dinner
at
the
parson
house
in
dillsborough
but
on
the
whole
he
had
produced
for
himself
a
general
respect
among
educated
men
which
was
not
diminished
by
the
fact
that
he
seemed
to
count
quite
as
little
on
that
as
on
the
and
abuse
of
others
for
some
days
previous
to
the
delivery
of
the
lecture
the
hoardings
in
london
were
crowded
with
sesquipedalian
notices
of
the
entertainment
so
that
senator
gotobed
great
oration
on
the
irrationality
of
englishmen
was
looked
to
with
considerable
interest
when
an
intelligent
japanese
travels
in
great
britain
or
an
intelligent
briton
in
japan
he
is
struck
with
no
wonder
at
national
differences
he
is
on
the
other
hand
rather
startled
to
find
how
like
his
strange
brother
is
to
him
in
many
things
crime
is
persecuted
wickedness
is
condoned
and
goodness
treated
with
indifference
in
both
countries
men
care
more
for
what
they
eat
than
anything
else
and
combine
a
closely
defined
idea
of
meum
with
a
lax
perception
as
to
tuum
barring
a
little
difference
of
complexion
and
feature
the
englishman
would
make
a
good
japanese
or
the
japanese
a
englishman
but
when
an
american
comes
to
us
or
a
briton
goes
to
the
states
each
speaking
the
same
language
using
the
same
cookery
governed
by
the
same
laws
and
wearing
the
same
costume
the
differences
which
present
themselves
are
so
striking
that
neither
can
live
six
months
in
the
country
of
the
other
without
a
holding
up
of
the
hands
and
a
torrent
of
exclamations
and
in
nineteen
cases
out
of
twenty
the
surprise
and
the
ejaculations
take
the
place
of
censure
the
intelligence
of
the
american
displayed
through
the
nose
worries
the
englishman
the
unconscious
of
the
englishman
not
always
unaccompanied
by
a
sneer
irritates
the
american
they
meet
as
might
a
lad
from
harrow
and
another
from
brumby
successful
mechanical
cramming
establishment
the
harrow
boy
can
not
answer
a
question
but
is
sure
that
he
is
the
proper
thing
and
is
ready
to
face
the
world
on
that
assurance
brumby
paragon
is
shocked
at
the
other
inaptitude
for
examination
but
is
at
the
same
time
tortured
by
envy
of
he
knows
not
what
in
this
spirit
we
americans
and
englishmen
go
on
writing
books
about
each
other
sometimes
with
bitterness
enough
but
generally
with
good
final
results
but
in
the
meantime
there
has
sprung
up
a
jealousy
which
makes
each
inclined
to
hate
the
other
at
first
sight
hate
is
difficult
and
expensive
and
between
individuals
soon
gives
place
to
love
i
can
not
bear
americans
as
a
rule
though
i
have
been
very
lucky
myself
with
a
few
friends
who
in
england
has
not
heard
that
form
of
speech
over
and
over
again
and
what
englishman
has
travelled
in
the
states
without
hearing
abuse
of
all
english
institutions
uttered
amidst
the
pauses
of
a
hospitality
which
has
left
him
nothing
to
desire
mr
senator
gotobed
had
expressed
his
mind
openly
wheresoever
he
went
but
being
a
man
of
immense
energy
was
not
content
with
such
private
utterances
he
could
not
liberate
his
soul
without
doing
something
in
public
to
convince
his
cousins
that
in
their
general
practices
of
life
they
were
not
guided
by
reason
he
had
no
object
of
making
money
to
give
him
his
due
we
must
own
that
he
had
no
object
of
making
fame
he
was
impelled
by
that
intense
desire
to
express
himself
which
often
amounts
to
passion
with
us
and
sometimes
to
fury
with
americans
and
he
hardly
considered
much
what
reception
his
words
might
receive
it
was
only
when
he
was
told
by
others
that
his
lecture
might
give
offence
which
possibly
would
turn
to
violence
that
he
made
inquiry
as
to
the
attendance
of
the
police
but
though
they
should
tear
him
to
pieces
he
would
say
what
he
had
to
say
it
should
not
be
his
fault
if
the
absurdities
of
a
people
whom
he
really
loved
were
not
exposed
to
light
so
that
they
might
be
acknowledged
and
abandoned
he
had
found
time
to
travel
to
birmingham
to
manchester
to
liverpool
to
glasgow
and
to
other
places
and
really
thought
that
he
had
mastered
his
great
subject
he
had
worked
very
hard
but
was
probably
premature
in
thinking
that
he
knew
england
thoroughly
he
had
however
undoubtedly
dipped
into
a
great
many
matters
and
could
probably
have
told
many
englishmen
much
that
they
did
know
about
their
own
affairs
he
had
poked
his
nose
everywhere
and
had
scrupled
to
ask
no
question
he
had
seen
the
miseries
of
a
casual
ward
the
despair
of
an
expiring
strike
the
amenities
of
a
city
slum
and
the
stolid
apathy
of
a
rural
labourer
home
he
had
measured
the
animal
food
consumed
by
the
working
classes
and
knew
the
exact
amount
of
alcohol
swallowed
by
the
average
briton
he
had
seen
also
the
luxury
of
baronial
halls
the
extravagances
of
commercial
palaces
the
unending
labours
of
our
as
with
lord
rufford
and
the
dullness
of
ordinary
country
life
as
experienced
by
himself
at
bragton
and
now
he
was
going
to
tell
the
english
people
at
large
what
he
thought
about
it
all
the
great
room
at
james
hall
had
been
secured
for
the
occasion
and
lord
drummond
the
minister
of
state
in
foreign
affairs
had
been
induced
to
take
the
chair
in
these
days
our
governments
are
very
anxious
to
be
civil
to
foreigners
and
there
is
nothing
that
a
robust
secretary
of
state
will
not
do
for
them
on
the
platform
there
were
many
members
of
both
houses
of
parliament
and
almost
everybody
connected
with
the
foreign
office
every
ticket
had
been
taken
for
weeks
since
the
front
benches
were
filled
with
the
wives
and
daughters
of
those
on
the
platform
and
back
behind
into
the
distant
spaces
in
which
seeing
was
difficult
and
hearing
impossible
the
crowd
was
gathered
at
a
head
all
of
which
was
going
to
some
great
british
charity
from
seven
to
eight
piccadilly
and
regent
street
were
crammed
and
when
the
senator
came
himself
with
his
chairman
he
could
hardly
make
his
way
in
at
the
doors
a
great
treat
was
expected
but
there
was
among
the
officers
of
police
some
who
thought
that
a
portion
of
the
audience
would
not
bear
quietly
the
hard
things
that
would
be
said
and
that
there
was
an
uncanny
gathering
of
roughs
about
the
street
who
were
not
prepared
to
be
on
their
best
behaviour
when
they
should
be
told
that
old
england
was
being
abused
lord
drummond
opened
the
proceedings
by
telling
the
audience
in
a
voice
clearly
audible
to
the
reporters
and
the
first
benches
that
they
had
come
there
to
hear
what
a
and
distinguished
foreigner
thought
of
their
country
they
would
not
he
was
sure
expect
to
be
flattered
than
flattery
nothing
was
more
useless
or
ignoble
this
gentleman
coming
from
a
new
country
in
which
tradition
was
of
no
avail
and
on
which
the
customs
of
former
centuries
had
had
no
opportunities
to
engraft
themselves
had
seen
many
things
here
which
in
his
eyes
could
not
justify
themselves
by
reason
lord
drummond
was
a
little
too
prolix
for
a
chairman
and
at
last
concluded
by
expressing
his
conviction
that
his
countrymen
would
listen
to
the
distinguished
senator
with
that
courtesy
which
was
due
to
a
foreigner
and
due
also
to
the
great
and
brotherly
nation
from
which
he
had
come
then
the
senator
rose
and
the
clapping
of
hands
and
kicking
of
heels
was
most
satisfactory
there
was
at
any
rate
no
prejudice
at
the
onset
english
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
said
i
am
in
the
unenviable
position
of
having
to
say
hard
things
to
you
for
about
an
hour
and
a
half
together
if
i
do
not
drive
you
from
your
seats
before
my
lecture
is
done
and
this
is
the
more
the
pity
because
i
could
talk
to
you
for
three
hours
about
your
country
and
not
say
an
unpleasant
word
his
lordship
has
told
you
that
flattery
is
not
my
purpose
neither
is
praise
which
would
not
be
flattery
why
should
i
collect
three
or
four
thousand
people
here
to
tell
them
of
virtues
the
consciousness
of
which
is
the
inheritance
of
each
of
them
you
are
brave
and
generous
and
you
are
lovely
to
look
at
with
sweetly
polished
manners
but
you
know
all
that
quite
well
enough
without
my
telling
you
but
it
strikes
me
that
you
do
not
know
how
little
prone
you
are
to
admit
the
light
of
reason
into
either
your
public
or
private
life
and
how
generally
you
allow
yourselves
to
be
guided
by
traditions
prejudices
and
customs
which
should
be
obsolete
if
you
will
consent
to
listen
to
what
one
foreigner
thinks
though
he
himself
be
a
man
of
no
account
you
may
perchance
gather
from
his
words
something
of
the
opinion
of
bystanders
in
general
and
so
be
able
perhaps
a
little
to
rectify
your
gait
and
your
costume
and
the
tones
of
your
voice
as
we
are
all
apt
to
do
when
we
come
from
our
private
homes
out
among
the
eyes
of
the
public
this
was
received
very
well
the
senator
spoke
with
a
clear
sonorous
voice
no
doubt
with
a
twang
but
so
audibly
as
to
satisfy
the
room
in
general
i
shall
not
he
said
dwell
much
on
your
form
of
government
were
i
to
praise
a
republic
i
might
seem
to
belittle
your
throne
and
the
lady
who
sits
on
it
an
offence
which
would
not
be
endured
for
a
moment
by
english
ears
i
will
take
the
monarchy
as
it
is
simply
remarking
that
its
recondite
forms
are
very
hard
to
be
understood
by
foreigners
and
that
they
seem
to
me
to
be
for
the
most
part
equally
dark
to
natives
i
have
hardly
as
yet
met
two
englishmen
who
were
agreed
as
to
the
political
power
of
the
sovereign
and
most
of
those
of
whom
i
have
enquired
have
assured
me
that
the
matter
is
one
as
to
which
they
have
not
found
it
worth
their
while
to
make
inquiry
here
a
voice
from
the
end
of
the
hall
made
some
protestation
but
the
nature
of
the
protest
did
not
reach
the
platform
but
continued
the
senator
now
rising
into
energy
tho
i
will
not
meddle
with
your
form
of
government
i
may
i
hope
be
allowed
to
allude
to
the
political
agents
by
which
it
is
conducted
you
are
proud
of
your
parliament
we
are
said
a
voice
i
wonder
of
which
house
i
do
not
ask
the
question
that
it
may
be
answered
because
it
is
advisable
at
the
present
moment
that
there
should
be
only
one
speaker
that
labour
is
unfortunately
for
me
at
present
in
my
hands
and
i
am
sure
you
will
agree
with
me
that
it
should
not
be
divided
you
mean
probably
that
you
are
proud
of
your
house
of
commons
and
that
you
are
so
because
it
speaks
with
the
voice
of
the
people
the
voice
of
the
people
in
order
that
it
may
be
heard
without
unjust
preponderance
on
this
side
or
on
that
requires
much
manipulation
that
manipulation
has
in
latter
years
been
effected
by
your
reform
bills
of
which
during
the
last
half
century
there
have
in
fact
been
four
or
five
the
latter
in
favour
of
the
ballot
having
been
perhaps
the
greatest
there
have
been
bills
for
purity
of
elections
very
necessary
bills
for
creating
constituencies
bills
for
abolishing
them
bills
for
dividing
them
bills
for
extending
the
suffrage
and
bills
if
i
am
not
mistaken
for
curtailing
it
and
what
has
been
the
result
how
many
men
are
there
in
this
room
who
know
the
respective
nature
of
their
votes
and
is
there
a
single
woman
who
knows
the
political
worth
of
her
husband
vote
passing
the
other
day
from
the
bank
of
this
great
metropolis
to
its
suburb
called
brentford
journeying
as
i
did
the
whole
way
through
continuous
rows
of
houses
i
found
myself
at
first
in
a
very
ancient
borough
returning
four
members
double
the
usual
number
not
because
of
its
population
but
because
it
has
always
been
so
here
i
was
informed
that
the
residents
had
little
or
nothing
to
do
with
it
i
was
told
though
i
did
not
quite
believe
what
i
heard
that
there
were
no
residents
the
voters
however
at
any
rate
the
influential
voters
never
pass
a
night
there
and
combine
their
city
franchise
with
franchises
elsewhere
i
then
went
through
two
enormous
boroughs
one
so
old
as
to
have
a
great
political
history
of
its
own
and
the
other
so
new
as
to
have
none
it
did
strike
me
as
odd
that
there
should
be
a
new
borough
with
new
voters
and
new
franchises
not
yet
ten
years
old
in
the
midst
of
this
city
of
london
but
when
i
came
to
brentford
everything
was
changed
i
was
not
in
a
town
at
all
though
i
was
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
houses
everything
around
me
was
grim
and
dirty
enough
but
i
am
supposed
to
have
reached
politically
the
rustic
beauties
of
the
country
those
around
me
who
had
votes
voted
for
the
county
of
middlesex
on
the
other
side
of
the
invisible
border
i
had
just
past
the
poor
wretch
with
a
day
who
lived
in
a
grimy
lodging
or
a
hut
but
who
at
any
rate
possessed
the
political
privilege
now
i
had
suddenly
emerged
among
the
aristocrats
and
quite
another
state
of
things
prevailed
is
that
a
reasonable
manipulation
of
the
votes
of
the
people
does
that
arrangement
give
to
any
man
an
equal
share
in
his
country
and
yet
i
fancy
that
the
thing
is
so
little
thought
of
that
few
among
you
are
aware
that
in
this
way
the
largest
class
of
british
labour
is
excluded
from
the
franchise
in
a
country
which
boasts
of
equal
representation
the
chief
object
of
your
first
reform
bill
was
that
of
realising
the
very
fact
of
representation
up
to
that
time
your
members
of
the
house
of
commons
were
in
truth
deputies
of
the
lords
or
of
other
rich
men
lord
a
or
b
or
perhaps
lady
c
sent
whom
she
pleased
to
parliament
to
represent
this
or
that
town
or
occasionally
this
or
that
county
that
absurdity
is
supposed
to
be
past
and
on
evils
that
have
been
cured
no
one
should
dwell
but
how
is
it
now
i
have
a
list
in
my
memory
for
i
would
not
care
to
make
out
so
black
a
catalogue
in
legible
letters
of
forty
members
who
have
been
returned
to
the
present
house
of
commons
by
the
single
voices
of
influential
persons
what
will
not
forty
voices
do
even
in
your
parliament
and
if
i
can
count
forty
how
many
more
must
there
be
of
which
i
have
not
heard
then
there
was
a
voice
calling
upon
the
senator
to
name
those
men
and
other
voices
denying
the
fact
i
will
name
no
one
said
the
senator
how
could
i
tell
what
noble
friend
i
might
put
on
a
stool
of
repentance
by
doing
so
and
he
looked
round
on
the
gentlemen
on
the
platform
behind
him
but
i
defy
any
member
of
parliament
here
present
to
get
up
and
say
that
it
is
not
so
then
he
paused
a
moment
and
if
it
be
so
is
that
rational
is
that
in
accordance
with
the
theory
of
representation
as
to
which
you
have
all
been
so
ardent
and
which
you
profess
to
be
so
dear
to
you
is
the
country
not
by
the
aristocracy
when
lord
lambswool
not
only
possesses
his
own
hereditary
seat
in
the
house
of
lords
but
also
has
a
seat
for
his
eldest
son
in
the
house
of
commons
then
a
voice
from
the
back
called
out
what
the
deuce
is
all
that
to
you
chapter
xxiv
the
senator
no
ii
if
i
see
a
man
hungry
in
the
street
said
the
senator
instigated
by
the
question
asked
him
at
the
end
of
the
last
chapter
and
give
him
a
bit
of
bread
i
do
do
it
for
my
own
sake
but
for
his
up
to
this
time
the
britishers
around
him
on
the
platform
and
those
in
the
benches
near
to
him
had
received
what
he
said
with
a
good
grace
the
allusion
to
lord
lambswool
had
not
been
pleasant
to
them
but
it
had
not
been
worse
than
they
had
expected
but
now
they
were
displeased
they
did
not
like
being
told
that
they
were
taking
a
bit
of
bread
from
him
in
their
own
political
destitution
they
did
not
like
that
he
an
individual
should
presume
that
he
had
bread
to
offer
to
them
as
a
nation
and
yet
had
they
argued
it
out
in
their
own
minds
they
would
have
seen
that
the
senator
metaphor
was
appropriate
his
purpose
in
being
there
was
to
give
advice
and
theirs
in
coming
to
listen
to
it
but
it
was
unfortunate
when
i
ventured
to
come
before
you
here
i
made
all
this
my
business
continued
the
senator
then
he
paused
and
glanced
round
the
hall
with
a
defiant
look
and
now
about
your
house
of
lords
he
went
on
i
have
not
much
to
say
about
the
house
of
lords
because
if
i
understand
rightly
the
feeling
of
this
country
it
is
already
condemned
no
such
thing
who
told
you
that
you
know
nothing
about
it
these
and
other
words
of
curt
denial
came
from
the
distant
corners
and
a
slight
murmur
of
disapprobation
was
heard
even
from
the
seats
on
the
platform
then
lord
drummond
got
up
and
begged
that
there
might
be
silence
gotobed
had
come
there
to
tell
them
his
views
and
as
they
had
come
there
expressly
to
listen
to
him
they
could
not
without
impropriety
interrupt
him
that
such
will
be
the
feeling
of
the
country
before
long
continued
the
senator
i
think
no
one
can
doubt
who
has
learned
how
to
look
to
the
signs
of
the
times
in
such
matters
is
it
possible
that
the
theory
of
an
hereditary
legislature
can
be
defended
with
reason
for
a
legislature
you
want
the
best
and
wisest
of
your
people
you
do
get
them
in
america
said
a
voice
which
was
beginning
to
be
recognised
we
try
at
any
rate
said
the
senator
now
is
it
possible
that
an
accident
of
birth
should
give
you
excellence
and
wisdom
what
is
the
result
not
a
tenth
of
your
hereditary
legislators
assemble
in
the
beautiful
hall
that
you
have
built
for
them
and
of
that
tenth
the
greater
half
consists
of
counsellors
of
state
who
have
been
placed
there
in
order
that
the
business
of
the
country
may
not
be
brought
to
a
standstill
your
hereditary
chamber
is
a
fiction
supplemented
by
the
element
of
election
the
election
resting
generally
in
the
very
bosom
of
the
house
of
commons
on
this
subject
although
he
had
promised
to
be
short
he
said
much
more
which
was
received
for
the
most
part
in
silence
but
when
he
ended
by
telling
them
that
they
could
have
no
right
to
call
themselves
a
free
people
till
every
legislator
in
the
country
was
elected
by
the
votes
of
the
people
another
murmur
was
heard
through
the
hall
i
told
you
said
he
waxing
more
and
more
energetic
as
he
felt
the
opposition
which
he
was
bound
to
overcome
that
what
i
had
to
say
to
you
would
not
be
pleasant
if
you
can
not
endure
to
hear
me
let
us
break
up
and
go
away
in
that
case
i
must
tell
my
friends
at
home
that
the
tender
ears
of
a
british
audience
can
not
bear
rough
words
from
american
lips
and
yet
if
you
think
of
it
we
have
borne
rough
words
from
you
and
have
borne
them
with
again
he
paused
but
as
none
rose
from
their
seats
he
went
on
proceeding
from
hereditary
legislature
i
come
to
hereditary
property
it
is
natural
that
a
man
should
wish
to
give
to
his
children
after
his
death
the
property
which
he
has
enjoyed
during
their
life
but
let
me
ask
any
man
here
who
has
not
been
born
an
eldest
son
himself
whether
it
is
natural
that
he
should
wish
to
give
it
all
to
one
son
would
any
man
think
of
doing
so
by
the
light
of
his
own
reason
out
of
his
own
head
as
we
say
would
any
man
be
so
unjust
to
those
who
are
equal
in
his
love
were
he
not
constrained
by
law
and
by
custom
more
even
than
the
law
the
senator
had
here
made
a
mistake
very
common
with
americans
and
a
great
many
voices
were
on
him
at
once
what
law
there
is
no
law
you
know
nothing
about
it
go
back
and
learn
what
cried
the
senator
coming
forward
to
the
extreme
verge
of
the
platform
and
putting
down
his
foot
as
though
there
were
strength
enough
in
his
leg
to
crush
them
all
will
any
one
have
the
hardihood
to
tell
me
that
property
in
this
country
is
not
affected
by
primogeniture
go
back
and
learn
the
law
i
know
the
law
perhaps
better
than
most
of
you
do
you
mean
to
assert
that
my
lord
lambswool
can
leave
his
land
to
whom
he
pleases
i
tell
you
that
he
has
no
more
than
a
in
it
and
that
his
son
will
only
have
the
same
then
an
eager
briton
on
the
platform
got
up
and
whispered
to
the
senator
for
a
few
minutes
during
which
the
murmuring
was
continued
my
friend
reminds
me
said
the
senator
that
the
matter
is
one
of
custom
rather
than
law
and
i
am
obliged
to
him
but
the
custom
which
is
damnable
and
cruel
is
backed
by
law
which
is
equally
so
if
i
have
land
i
can
not
only
give
it
all
to
my
eldest
son
but
i
can
assure
the
right
of
primogeniture
to
his
son
though
he
be
not
yet
born
no
one
i
think
will
deny
that
there
must
be
a
special
law
to
enable
me
to
commit
an
injustice
so
unnatural
as
that
hence
it
comes
that
you
still
suffer
under
an
aristocracy
almost
as
dominant
and
in
its
essence
as
irrational
as
that
which
created
feudalism
the
gentlemen
collected
on
the
platform
looked
at
each
other
and
smiled
perhaps
failing
to
catch
the
exact
meaning
of
the
senator
words
a
lord
here
has
a
power
as
a
lord
which
he
can
not
himself
fathom
and
of
which
he
daily
makes
an
unconscious
but
most
deleterious
use
he
is
brought
up
to
think
it
natural
that
he
should
be
a
tyrant
the
proclivities
of
his
order
are
generous
and
as
a
rule
he
gives
more
than
he
takes
but
he
is
as
injurious
in
the
one
process
as
in
the
other
your
ordinary
briton
in
his
dealing
with
a
lord
expects
payment
in
some
shape
for
every
repetition
of
the
absurd
title
and
payment
is
made
the
titled
aristocrat
pays
dearer
for
his
horse
dearer
for
his
coat
dearer
for
his
servant
than
other
people
but
in
return
he
exacts
much
which
no
other
person
can
get
knowing
his
own
magnanimity
he
expects
that
his
word
shall
not
be
questioned
if
i
may
be
allowed
i
will
tell
a
little
story
as
to
one
of
the
most
generous
gentlemen
i
have
had
the
happiness
of
meeting
in
this
country
which
will
explain
my
meaning
then
without
mentioning
names
he
told
the
story
of
lord
rufford
goarly
and
scrobby
in
such
a
way
as
partly
to
redeem
himself
with
his
audience
he
acknowledged
how
absolutely
he
had
been
himself
befooled
and
how
he
had
been
done
out
of
his
money
by
misplaced
sympathy
he
made
goarly
goose
immortal
and
in
imitating
the
indignation
of
runce
the
farmer
and
bean
the
gamekeeper
showed
that
he
was
master
of
considerable
humour
but
he
brought
it
all
round
at
last
to
his
own
purpose
and
ended
this
episode
of
his
lecture
by
his
view
of
the
absurdity
and
illegality
of
british
hunting
i
can
talk
about
it
to
you
he
said
and
you
will
know
whether
i
am
speaking
the
truth
but
when
i
get
home
among
my
own
people
and
repeat
my
lecture
there
as
i
shall
do
with
some
little
additions
as
to
the
good
things
i
have
found
here
from
which
your
ears
may
be
spared
i
shall
omit
this
story
as
i
know
it
will
be
impossible
to
make
my
countrymen
believe
that
a
hundred
tomboys
may
ride
at
their
pleasure
over
every
man
land
destroying
crops
and
trampling
down
fences
going
if
their
vermin
leads
them
there
with
reckless
violence
into
the
sweet
domestic
garden
of
your
country
residences
and
that
no
one
can
either
stop
them
or
punish
them
an
american
will
believe
much
about
the
wonderful
ways
of
his
british
cousin
but
no
american
will
be
got
to
believe
that
till
he
sees
it
i
find
said
he
that
this
irrationality
as
i
have
ventured
to
call
it
runs
through
all
your
professions
we
will
take
the
church
as
being
the
highest
at
any
rate
in
its
objects
then
he
recapitulated
all
those
arguments
against
our
mode
of
dispensing
church
patronage
with
which
the
reader
is
already
familiar
if
he
has
attended
to
the
senator
earlier
words
as
given
in
this
chronicle
in
other
lines
of
business
there
is
even
here
in
england
some
attempt
made
to
get
the
man
best
suited
for
the
work
he
has
to
do
if
any
one
wants
a
domestic
servant
he
sets
about
the
work
of
getting
a
proper
person
in
a
very
determined
manner
indeed
but
for
the
care
or
as
you
call
it
the
cure
of
his
soul
he
has
to
put
up
with
the
man
who
has
bought
the
right
to
minister
to
his
wants
or
with
him
whose
father
wants
a
means
of
living
for
his
younger
son
the
elder
being
destined
to
swallow
all
the
family
property
or
with
him
who
has
become
sick
of
drinking
his
wine
in
an
oxford
college
or
with
him
again
who
has
pleaded
his
cause
successfully
with
a
bishop
daughter
it
is
not
often
that
the
british
public
is
angered
by
abuse
of
the
church
and
this
part
of
the
lecture
was
allowed
to
pass
without
strong
marks
of
disapprobation
i
have
been
at
some
trouble
he
continued
to
learn
the
very
complex
rules
by
which
your
army
is
now
regulated
and
those
by
which
it
was
regulated
a
very
short
time
since
unhappily
for
me
i
have
found
it
in
a
state
of
transition
and
nothing
is
so
difficult
to
a
stranger
comprehension
as
a
transition
state
of
affairs
but
this
i
can
see
plainly
that
every
improvement
which
is
made
is
received
by
those
whom
it
most
concerns
with
a
horror
which
amounts
almost
to
madness
so
lovely
to
the
ancient
british
feudal
instinct
is
a
state
of
unreason
that
the
very
absence
of
any
principle
endears
to
it
institutions
which
no
one
can
attempt
to
support
by
argument
had
such
a
thing
not
existed
as
the
right
to
purchase
military
promotion
would
any
satirist
have
been
listened
to
who
had
suggested
it
as
a
possible
outcome
of
british
irrationality
think
what
it
carries
with
it
the
man
who
has
proved
himself
fit
to
serve
his
country
by
serving
it
in
twenty
foughten
fields
who
has
bled
for
his
country
and
perhaps
preserved
his
country
shall
rot
in
obscurity
because
he
has
no
money
to
buy
promotion
whereas
the
young
dandy
who
has
done
no
more
than
glitter
along
the
pavements
with
his
sword
and
spurs
shall
have
the
command
of
men
because
he
has
so
many
thousand
dollars
in
his
pocket
shouted
the
inimical
voice
but
is
it
asked
the
intrepid
senator
will
any
one
who
knows
what
he
is
talking
about
say
that
i
am
describing
a
state
of
things
which
did
not
exist
yesterday
i
will
acknowledge
that
this
has
been
rectified
tho
i
see
symptoms
of
relapse
a
fault
that
has
been
mended
is
a
fault
no
longer
but
what
i
speak
of
now
is
the
disruption
of
all
concord
in
your
army
caused
by
the
reform
which
has
forced
itself
upon
you
all
loyalty
has
gone
all
that
love
of
his
profession
which
should
be
the
breath
of
a
soldier
nostrils
a
fine
body
of
fighting
heroes
is
not
because
injury
has
been
done
to
them
or
to
any
of
them
but
because
the
system
had
become
peculiarly
british
by
reason
of
its
special
absurdity
and
therefore
peculiarly
dear
buncombe
again
said
the
voice
and
the
word
was
now
repeated
by
a
dozen
voices
let
any
one
show
me
that
it
is
buncombe
if
i
say
what
is
untrue
do
with
me
what
you
please
if
i
am
ignorant
set
me
right
and
laugh
at
me
but
if
what
i
say
is
true
then
your
interruption
is
surely
a
sign
of
imbecility
i
say
that
the
change
was
forced
upon
you
by
the
feeling
of
the
people
but
that
its
very
expediency
has
demoralized
the
army
because
the
army
was
irrational
and
how
is
it
with
the
navy
what
am
i
to
believe
when
i
hear
so
many
conflicting
statements
among
yourselves
during
this
last
appeal
however
the
noise
at
the
back
of
the
hall
had
become
so
violent
that
the
senator
was
hardly
able
to
make
his
voice
heard
by
those
immediately
around
him
he
himself
did
not
quail
for
a
moment
going
on
with
his
gestures
and
setting
down
his
foot
as
though
he
were
still
confident
in
his
purpose
of
overcoming
all
opposition
he
had
not
much
above
half
done
yet
there
were
the
lawyers
before
him
and
the
civil
service
and
the
railways
and
the
commerce
of
the
country
and
the
labouring
classes
but
lord
drummond
and
others
near
him
were
becoming
terrified
thinking
that
something
worse
might
occur
unless
an
end
was
put
to
the
proceedings
then
a
superintendent
of
police
came
in
and
whispered
to
his
lordship
a
crowd
was
collecting
itself
in
piccadilly
and
james
street
and
perhaps
the
senator
had
better
be
withdrawn
the
officer
did
not
think
that
he
could
safely
answer
for
the
consequences
if
this
were
carried
on
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
longer
then
lord
drummond
having
meditated
for
a
moment
touched
the
senator
arm
and
suggested
a
withdrawal
into
a
side
room
for
a
minute
gotobed
he
said
a
little
feeling
has
been
excited
and
we
had
better
put
an
end
to
this
for
the
present
put
an
end
to
it
i
am
afraid
we
must
the
police
are
becoming
alarmed
oh
of
course
you
know
best
in
our
country
a
man
is
allowed
to
express
himself
unless
he
utters
either
blasphemy
or
calumny
but
i
am
in
your
hands
and
of
course
you
must
do
as
you
please
then
he
sat
down
in
a
corner
and
wiped
his
brow
lord
drummond
returned
to
the
hall
and
there
endeavoured
to
explain
that
the
lecture
was
over
for
that
night
the
row
was
so
great
that
it
did
not
matter
much
what
he
said
but
the
people
soon
understood
that
the
american
senator
was
not
to
appear
before
them
again
it
was
not
much
after
nine
when
the
senator
reached
his
hotel
lord
drummond
having
accompanied
him
thither
in
a
cab
good
night
gotobed
said
his
lordship
i
can
not
tell
you
how
much
i
respect
both
your
purpose
and
your
courage
but
i
do
know
how
far
it
is
wise
for
a
man
to
tell
any
other
man
much
less
a
nation
of
all
his
faults
you
english
tell
us
of
ours
pretty
often
said
the
senator
when
he
found
himself
alone
he
thought
of
it
all
giving
himself
no
special
credit
for
what
he
had
done
acknowledging
to
himself
that
he
had
often
chosen
his
words
badly
and
expressed
himself
imperfectly
but
declaring
to
himself
through
it
all
that
the
want
of
reason
among
britishers
was
so
great
that
no
one
ought
to
treat
them
as
wholly
responsible
beings
chapter
xxv
the
last
days
of
mary
masters
the
triumph
of
mary
masters
was
something
more
than
a
nine
wonder
to
the
people
of
dillsborough
they
had
all
known
larry
twentyman
intentions
and
aspirations
and
had
generally
condemned
the
young
lady
obduracy
thinking
and
not
being
slow
to
say
that
she
would
live
to
repent
her
perversity
runciman
who
had
a
thoroughly
friendship
for
both
the
attorney
and
larry
had
sometimes
been
very
severe
on
mary
she
wants
a
touch
of
hardship
he
would
say
to
bring
her
to
if
larry
would
just
give
her
a
cold
shoulder
for
six
months
she
be
ready
to
jump
into
his
arms
and
nupper
had
been
heard
to
remark
that
she
might
go
farther
and
fare
worse
if
it
were
my
girl
i
let
her
know
all
about
it
ribbs
the
butcher
had
said
in
the
bosom
of
his
own
family
when
it
was
found
that
surtees
the
curate
was
not
to
be
the
fortunate
man
the
matter
was
more
inexplicable
than
ever
had
it
then
been
declared
that
the
owner
of
hoppet
hall
had
proposed
to
her
all
these
tongues
would
have
been
silenced
and
the
refusal
even
of
larry
twentyman
would
have
been
justified
but
what
was
to
be
said
and
what
was
to
be
thought
when
it
was
known
that
she
was
to
be
the
mistress
of
bragton
for
a
day
or
two
the
prosperity
of
the
attorney
was
hardly
to
be
endured
by
his
neighbours
when
it
was
first
known
that
the
stewardship
of
the
property
was
to
go
back
into
his
hands
his
rise
in
the
world
was
for
a
time
slightly
prejudicial
to
his
popularity
but
this
greater
stroke
of
luck
this
latter
promotion
which
would
place
him
so
much
higher
in
dillsborough
than
even
his
father
or
his
grandfather
had
ever
been
was
a
great
trial
of
friendship
masters
felt
it
all
very
keenly
all
possibility
for
reproach
against
either
her
husband
or
her
was
of
course
at
an
end
even
she
did
not
pretend
to
say
that
mary
ought
to
refuse
the
squire
nor
as
far
as
mary
was
concerned
could
she
have
further
recourse
to
the
evils
of
ushanting
and
the
peril
of
social
intercourse
with
ladies
and
gentlemen
it
was
manifest
that
mary
was
to
be
a
lady
with
a
big
house
and
many
servants
and
no
doubt
a
carriage
and
horses
but
still
masters
was
not
quite
silenced
she
had
daughters
of
her
own
and
would
solace
herself
by
declaring
to
them
to
her
husband
and
to
her
specially
intimate
friends
that
of
course
they
would
see
no
more
of
mary
it
was
for
them
to
expect
to
be
asked
to
bragton
and
as
for
herself
she
would
much
rather
not
she
knew
her
own
place
and
what
she
was
born
to
and
was
going
to
let
her
own
children
spoil
themselves
and
ruin
their
chances
by
dining
at
seven
and
being
waited
upon
by
servants
at
every
turn
thank
god
her
girls
could
make
their
own
beds
and
she
hoped
they
might
continue
to
do
so
at
any
rate
till
they
had
houses
of
their
own
and
there
seemed
to
dillsborough
to
be
some
justification
for
all
this
in
the
fact
that
mary
was
now
living
at
bragton
and
that
she
did
not
apparently
intend
to
return
to
her
father
house
at
this
time
reginald
morton
himself
was
still
at
hoppet
hall
and
had
declared
that
he
would
remain
there
till
after
his
marriage
lady
ushant
was
living
at
the
big
house
which
was
henceforth
to
be
her
home
mary
was
her
visitor
and
was
to
be
married
from
bragton
as
though
bragton
were
her
residence
rather
than
the
squire
the
plan
had
originated
with
reginald
and
when
it
had
been
hinted
to
him
that
mary
would
in
this
way
seem
to
slight
her
home
he
had
proposed
that
all
the
masters
should
come
and
stay
at
bragton
previous
to
the
ceremony
masters
yielded
as
to
residence
saying
with
mock
humility
that
of
course
she
had
no
room
fit
to
give
a
marriage
feast
to
the
squire
of
bragton
but
she
was
steadfast
in
saying
to
her
husband
who
made
the
proposition
to
her
that
she
would
stay
at
home
of
course
she
would
be
present
at
the
wedding
but
she
would
not
trouble
the
like
of
lady
ushant
by
any
prolonged
visiting
the
wedding
was
to
take
place
about
the
beginning
of
may
and
all
these
things
were
being
considered
early
in
april
at
this
time
one
of
the
girls
was
always
at
bragton
and
mary
had
done
her
best
but
hitherto
in
vain
to
induce
her
to
come
to
her
when
she
heard
that
there
was
a
doubt
as
to
the
accomplishment
of
the
plan
for
the
coming
of
the
whole
family
she
drove
herself
into
dillsborough
in
the
old
phaeton
and
then
pleaded
her
cause
for
herself
mamma
she
said
wo
you
come
with
the
girls
and
papa
on
the
i
think
not
my
dear
the
girls
can
go
if
they
like
it
but
it
will
be
more
fitting
for
papa
and
me
to
come
to
the
church
on
the
morning
why
more
fitting
mamma
well
my
dear
it
will
dear
mamma
why
why
of
course
my
dear
i
am
very
glad
that
you
are
going
to
get
such
a
lift
my
lift
is
marrying
the
man
i
love
that
of
course
is
all
right
i
have
nothing
on
earth
to
say
against
it
and
i
will
say
that
through
it
all
you
have
behaved
as
a
young
woman
should
i
do
think
you
meant
to
throw
yourself
at
him
mamma
but
as
it
has
turned
up
you
have
to
go
one
way
and
me
another
no
but
it
must
be
so
the
squire
of
bragton
is
the
squire
and
his
wife
must
act
accordingly
of
course
you
be
visiting
at
rufford
and
hampton
wick
and
all
the
places
i
know
very
well
who
i
am
and
what
i
came
from
i
not
a
bit
ashamed
of
myself
but
i
not
going
to
stick
myself
up
with
my
betters
then
mamma
i
shall
come
and
be
married
from
here
it
too
late
for
that
now
my
dear
no
it
is
not
and
then
a
couple
of
tears
began
to
roll
down
from
her
eyes
i
wo
be
married
without
your
coming
in
to
see
me
the
night
before
and
being
with
me
in
the
morning
when
i
dress
i
been
a
good
child
to
you
mamma
then
the
began
to
cry
also
have
i
mamma
yes
my
dear
whimpered
the
poor
woman
and
wo
you
be
my
mamma
to
the
last
wo
you
and
she
threw
her
arms
round
her
neck
and
kissed
her
i
wo
go
one
way
and
you
another
he
does
wish
it
it
is
quite
different
from
that
i
do
care
a
straw
for
hampton
wick
and
rufford
but
i
will
never
be
separated
from
you
and
the
girls
and
papa
say
you
will
come
mamma
i
will
not
let
you
go
till
you
say
you
will
come
of
course
she
had
her
own
way
and
masters
had
to
feel
with
a
sore
heart
that
she
also
must
go
out
ushanting
she
knew
that
in
spite
of
her
domestic
powers
she
would
be
stricken
dumb
in
the
at
bragton
and
was
unhappy
mary
had
another
scheme
in
which
she
was
less
fortunate
she
took
it
into
her
head
that
larry
twentyman
might
possibly
be
induced
to
come
to
her
wedding
she
had
heard
how
he
had
ridden
and
gained
honour
for
himself
on
the
day
that
the
hounds
killed
their
fox
at
norrington
and
thought
that
perhaps
her
own
message
to
him
had
induced
him
so
far
to
return
to
his
old
habits
and
now
she
longed
to
ask
him
for
her
sake
to
be
happy
once
again
if
any
girl
ever
loved
the
man
she
was
going
to
marry
with
all
her
heart
this
girl
loved
reginald
morton
he
had
been
to
her
when
her
love
was
hopeless
so
completely
the
master
of
her
heart
that
she
could
not
realise
the
possibility
of
affection
for
another
but
yet
she
was
pervaded
by
a
tenderness
of
feeling
in
regard
to
larry
which
was
love
also
though
love
altogether
of
another
kind
she
thought
of
him
daily
his
future
was
one
of
the
cares
of
her
life
that
her
husband
might
be
able
to
call
him
a
friend
was
among
her
prayers
had
anybody
spoken
ill
of
him
in
her
presence
she
would
have
resented
it
hotly
had
she
been
told
that
another
girl
had
consented
to
be
his
wife
she
would
have
thought
that
girl
to
be
happy
in
her
destiny
when
she
heard
that
he
was
leading
a
wretched
moping
aimless
life
for
her
sake
her
heart
was
sad
within
her
it
was
necessary
to
the
completion
of
her
happiness
that
larry
should
recover
his
tone
of
mind
and
be
her
friend
reg
she
said
leaning
on
his
arm
out
in
the
park
i
want
you
to
do
me
a
favour
watch
and
chain
do
be
an
idiot
you
know
i
got
a
watch
and
chain
some
girls
like
two
to
have
the
wooden
bridge
pulled
down
and
a
stone
one
built
if
any
one
touched
a
morsel
of
that
sacred
timber
he
should
be
banished
from
bragton
for
ever
i
want
you
to
ask
twentyman
to
come
to
our
wedding
who
to
do
it
who
to
bell
the
cat
you
i
would
sooner
fight
a
saracen
or
ride
such
a
horse
as
killed
that
poor
major
joking
apart
i
do
see
how
it
is
to
be
done
why
do
you
wish
it
because
i
am
so
fond
of
him
oh
indeed
if
you
a
goose
i
hit
you
i
am
fond
of
him
next
to
you
and
my
own
people
and
lady
ushant
i
like
him
best
in
all
the
world
what
a
pity
you
could
have
put
him
up
a
little
higher
i
used
to
think
so
too
only
i
could
if
anybody
loved
you
as
he
did
me
offered
you
everything
he
had
in
the
world
thought
that
you
were
the
best
in
the
world
would
have
given
his
life
for
you
would
not
you
be
grateful
i
do
know
that
i
need
wish
to
ask
such
a
person
to
my
wedding
yes
you
would
if
in
that
way
you
could
build
a
bridge
to
bring
him
back
to
happiness
and
reg
though
you
used
to
despise
him
i
never
despised
him
a
little
i
think
before
you
knew
him
but
he
is
not
despicable
not
at
all
my
dear
he
is
honest
and
good
and
has
a
real
heart
of
his
own
i
am
afraid
he
has
parted
with
that
you
know
what
i
mean
and
if
you
wo
be
serious
i
shall
think
there
is
no
seriousness
in
you
i
want
you
to
tell
me
how
it
can
be
done
then
he
was
serious
and
tried
to
explain
to
her
that
he
could
not
very
well
do
what
she
wanted
he
is
your
friend
you
know
rather
than
mine
but
if
you
like
to
write
to
him
you
can
do
so
this
seemed
to
her
to
be
very
difficult
and
as
she
thought
more
of
it
almost
impossible
a
written
letter
remains
and
may
be
taken
as
evidence
of
so
much
more
than
it
means
but
a
word
sometimes
may
be
spoken
which
if
it
be
well
spoken
if
assurance
of
its
truth
be
given
by
the
tone
and
by
the
eye
of
the
speaker
shall
do
so
much
more
than
any
letter
and
shall
yet
only
remain
with
the
hearer
as
the
remembrance
of
the
scent
of
a
flower
remains
nevertheless
she
did
at
last
write
the
letter
and
brought
it
to
her
husband
is
it
necessary
that
i
should
see
it
he
asked
not
absolutely
necessary
then
send
it
without
but
i
should
like
you
to
see
what
i
have
said
you
know
about
things
and
if
it
is
too
much
or
too
little
you
can
tell
me
then
he
read
her
letter
which
ran
as
follows
dear
twentyman
perhaps
you
have
heard
that
we
are
to
be
married
on
thursday
may
i
do
so
wish
that
you
would
come
it
would
make
me
so
much
happier
on
that
day
we
shall
be
very
quiet
and
if
you
would
come
to
the
house
at
eleven
you
could
go
across
the
park
with
them
all
to
the
church
i
am
to
be
taken
in
a
carriage
because
of
my
finery
then
there
will
be
a
little
breakfast
papa
and
mamma
and
dolly
and
kate
would
be
so
glad
and
so
would
morton
but
none
of
them
will
be
half
so
glad
as
your
old
old
affectionate
friend
mary
masters
if
that
do
fetch
him
said
reginald
he
is
a
poorer
creature
than
i
take
him
to
be
but
i
may
send
it
certainly
you
may
send
it
and
so
the
letter
was
sent
across
to
chowton
farm
but
the
letter
did
not
fetch
him
nor
am
i
prepared
to
agree
with
morton
that
he
was
a
poor
creature
for
not
being
fetched
there
are
things
which
the
heart
of
a
man
should
bear
without
whimpering
but
which
it
can
not
bear
in
public
with
that
appearance
of
stoical
indifference
which
the
manliness
of
a
man
is
supposed
to
require
were
he
to
go
should
he
be
jovial
before
the
wedding
party
or
should
he
be
sober
and
saturnine
should
he
appear
to
have
forgotten
his
love
or
should
he
go
about
lovelorn
among
the
wedding
guests
it
was
impossible
at
any
rate
impossible
as
yet
that
he
should
fall
into
that
state
of
almost
brotherly
regard
which
it
was
so
natural
that
she
should
desire
but
as
he
had
determined
to
forgive
her
he
went
across
that
afternoon
to
the
house
and
was
the
bearer
of
his
own
answer
he
asked
hopkins
who
came
to
the
door
whether
she
were
alone
and
was
then
shown
into
an
empty
room
where
he
waited
for
her
she
came
to
him
as
quickly
as
she
could
leaving
lady
ushant
in
the
middle
of
the
page
she
was
reading
and
feeling
as
she
tripped
downstairs
that
the
colour
was
rushing
to
her
face
you
will
come
larry
she
said
no
miss
masters
let
me
be
mary
till
i
am
morton
she
said
trying
to
smile
i
was
always
mary
and
then
she
burst
into
tears
why
why
wo
you
come
i
should
only
stalk
about
like
a
ghost
i
could
be
merry
as
a
man
should
be
at
a
wedding
i
do
see
how
a
man
is
to
do
such
a
thing
she
looked
up
into
his
face
imploring
him
not
to
come
for
that
she
felt
now
to
be
impossible
but
imploring
him
to
express
in
some
way
forgiveness
of
the
sin
she
had
committed
against
him
but
i
shall
think
of
you
and
shall
wish
you
well
and
after
that
we
shall
be
friends
by
and
bye
if
he
pleases
he
will
please
he
does
please
of
course
he
saw
what
i
wrote
to
you
and
now
larry
if
i
have
ever
treated
you
badly
say
that
you
pardon
me
if
i
had
known
it
he
said
how
could
i
tell
you
till
he
had
spoken
and
yet
i
knew
it
myself
it
has
been
so
oh
ever
so
long
what
could
i
do
you
will
say
that
you
will
forgive
me
yes
i
will
say
that
and
you
will
not
go
away
from
chowton
oh
no
they
tell
me
i
ought
to
stay
here
and
i
suppose
i
shall
stay
i
thought
i
just
come
over
and
say
a
word
i
going
away
for
a
month
there
is
a
fellow
has
got
some
fishing
in
ireland
larry
and
i
thought
perhaps
you
take
this
now
then
he
brought
out
from
his
pocket
a
little
ruby
ring
which
he
had
carried
often
in
his
pocket
to
the
attorney
house
thinking
that
perhaps
then
might
come
the
happy
hour
in
which
he
could
get
her
to
accept
it
but
the
hour
had
never
come
as
yet
and
the
ring
had
remained
in
the
little
drawer
beneath
his
it
need
hardly
be
said
that
she
now
accepted
the
gift
chapter
xxvi
conclusion
the
senator
for
mickewa
whose
name
we
have
taken
for
a
book
which
might
perhaps
have
been
better
called
the
chronicle
of
a
winter
at
dillsborough
did
not
stay
long
in
london
after
the
unfortunate
close
of
his
lecture
he
was
a
man
not
very
pervious
to
criticism
nor
afraid
of
it
but
he
did
not
like
the
treatment
he
had
received
at
james
hall
nor
the
remarks
which
his
lecture
produced
in
the
newspapers
he
was
angry
because
people
were
unreasonable
with
him
which
was
surely
unreasonable
in
him
who
accused
englishmen
generally
of
want
of
reason
one
ought
to
take
it
as
a
matter
of
course
that
a
bull
should
use
his
horns
and
a
wolf
his
teeth
the
senator
read
everything
that
was
said
of
him
and
then
wrote
numerous
letters
to
the
different
journals
which
had
condemned
him
had
any
one
accused
him
of
an
untruth
or
had
his
inaccuracies
been
glaring
had
he
not
always
expressed
his
readiness
to
acknowledge
his
own
mistake
if
convicted
of
ignorance
but
when
he
was
told
that
he
had
persistently
trodden
upon
all
the
corns
of
his
english
cousins
he
declared
that
corns
were
evil
things
which
should
be
abolished
and
that
with
corns
such
as
these
there
was
no
mode
of
abolition
so
efficacious
as
treading
on
them
i
am
sorry
that
you
should
have
encountered
anything
so
unpleasant
lord
drummond
said
to
him
when
he
went
to
bid
adieu
to
his
friend
at
the
foreign
office
and
i
am
sorry
too
my
lord
for
your
sake
rather
than
my
own
a
man
is
in
a
bad
case
who
can
not
endure
to
hear
of
his
faults
perhaps
you
take
our
national
sins
a
little
too
much
for
granted
i
do
think
so
my
lord
if
you
knew
me
to
be
wrong
you
would
not
be
so
sore
with
me
nevertheless
i
am
under
deep
obligation
for
hospitality
if
an
american
can
make
up
his
mind
to
crack
up
everything
he
sees
here
there
is
no
part
of
the
world
in
which
he
can
get
along
better
he
had
already
written
a
long
letter
home
to
his
friend
josiah
scroome
and
had
impartially
sent
to
that
gentleman
not
only
his
own
lecture
but
also
a
large
collection
of
the
criticisms
made
on
it
a
few
weeks
afterwards
he
took
his
departure
and
when
we
last
heard
of
him
was
thundering
in
the
senate
against
certain
practices
on
the
part
of
his
own
country
which
he
thought
to
be
unjust
to
other
nations
don
quixote
was
not
more
just
than
the
senator
or
more
philanthropic
nor
perhaps
more
apt
to
wage
war
against
the
windmills
having
in
this
our
last
chapter
given
the
place
of
honour
to
the
senator
we
must
now
say
a
parting
word
as
to
those
countrymen
of
our
own
who
have
figured
in
our
pages
lord
rufford
married
miss
penge
of
course
and
used
the
lady
fortune
in
buying
the
property
of
sir
john
purefoy
we
may
probably
be
safe
in
saying
that
the
acquisition
added
very
little
to
his
happiness
what
difference
can
it
make
to
a
man
whether
he
has
forty
or
fifty
thousand
pounds
a
year
or
at
any
rate
to
such
a
man
perhaps
miss
penge
herself
was
an
acquisition
he
did
not
hunt
so
often
or
shoot
so
much
and
was
seen
in
church
once
at
least
on
every
sunday
in
a
very
short
time
his
friends
perceived
that
a
very
great
change
had
come
over
him
he
was
growing
fat
and
soon
disliked
the
trouble
of
getting
up
early
to
go
to
a
distant
meet
and
before
a
year
or
two
had
passed
away
it
had
become
an
understood
thing
that
in
country
houses
he
was
not
one
of
the
men
who
went
down
at
night
into
the
in
a
short
and
a
picturesque
cap
miss
penge
had
done
all
this
he
had
had
his
period
of
pleasure
and
no
doubt
the
change
was
desirable
but
he
sometimes
thought
with
regret
of
the
promise
arabella
trefoil
had
made
him
that
she
would
never
interfere
with
his
gratification
at
dillsborough
everything
during
the
summer
after
the
marriage
fell
back
into
its
usual
routine
the
greatest
change
made
there
was
in
the
residence
of
the
attorney
who
with
his
family
went
over
to
live
at
hoppet
hall
giving
up
his
old
house
to
a
young
man
from
norrington
who
had
become
his
partner
but
keeping
the
old
office
for
his
business
masters
did
i
think
like
the
honour
and
glory
of
the
big
house
but
she
would
never
admit
that
she
did
and
when
she
was
constrained
once
or
twice
in
the
year
to
give
a
dinner
to
her
husband
and
lady
ushant
that
i
think
was
really
a
period
of
discomfort
to
her
when
at
bragton
she
could
at
any
rate
be
quiet
and
mary
caressing
care
almost
made
the
place
pleasant
to
her
runciman
prospers
at
the
bush
though
he
has
entirely
lost
his
best
customer
lord
rufford
but
the
is
still
strong
in
spite
of
the
philosophers
and
in
the
hunting
season
the
boxes
of
the
bush
inn
are
full
of
horses
the
club
goes
on
without
much
change
masters
being
very
regular
in
his
attendance
undeterred
by
the
grandeur
of
his
new
household
and
larry
is
always
there
with
increased
spirit
for
he
has
dined
two
or
three
times
lately
at
hampton
wick
having
met
young
hampton
at
the
squire
house
at
bragton
on
this
point
fred
botsey
was
for
a
time
very
jealous
but
he
found
that
larry
popularity
was
not
to
be
shaken
and
now
is
very
keen
in
pushing
an
intimacy
with
the
owner
of
chowton
farm
perhaps
the
most
stirring
event
in
the
neighbourhood
has
been
the
retirement
of
captain
glomax
from
the
post
of
master
when
the
season
was
over
he
made
an
application
to
lord
rufford
respecting
certain
stable
and
kennel
expenses
which
that
nobleman
snubbed
very
bluntly
thereupon
the
captain
intimated
to
the
committee
that
unless
some
advances
were
made
he
should
go
the
committee
refused
and
thereupon
the
captain
went
not
altogether
to
the
dissatisfaction
of
the
farmers
with
whom
an
itinerant
master
is
seldom
altogether
popular
then
for
a
time
there
was
great
gloom
in
the
u
what
hunting
man
or
woman
does
not
know
the
gloom
which
comes
over
a
hunting
county
when
one
master
goes
before
another
is
ready
to
step
in
his
shoes
there
had
been
a
hope
a
still
growing
hope
that
lord
rufford
would
come
forward
at
any
such
pinch
but
since
miss
penge
had
come
to
the
front
that
hope
had
altogether
vanished
there
was
a
word
said
at
rufford
on
the
subject
but
miss
penge
or
lady
rufford
as
she
was
then
at
once
put
her
foot
on
the
project
and
extinguished
it
then
when
despair
was
imminent
old
hampton
gave
way
and
young
hampton
came
forward
acknowledged
on
all
sides
as
the
man
for
the
place
a
master
always
does
appear
at
last
though
for
a
time
it
appears
that
the
kingdom
must
come
to
an
end
because
no
one
will
consent
to
sit
on
the
throne
perhaps
the
most
loudly
triumphant
man
in
dillsborough
was
mainwaring
the
parson
when
he
heard
of
the
discomfiture
of
senator
gotobed
he
could
hardly
restrain
his
joy
and
confided
first
to
nupper
and
then
to
runciman
his
opinion
that
of
all
the
blackguards
that
had
ever
put
their
foot
in
dillsborough
that
vile
yankee
was
the
worst
gotobed
was
no
more
a
yankee
than
was
the
parson
himself
but
of
any
distinction
among
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
mainwaring
knew
very
little
a
word
or
two
more
must
be
said
of
our
dear
friend
larry
twentyman
for
in
finishing
this
little
story
we
must
own
that
he
has
in
truth
been
our
hero
he
went
away
on
his
fishing
expedition
and
when
he
came
back
the
girl
of
his
heart
had
become
morton
hunting
had
long
been
over
then
but
the
great
hunting
difficulty
was
in
course
of
solution
and
larry
took
his
part
in
the
matter
when
there
was
a
suggestion
as
to
a
committee
of
three
than
which
nothing
for
hunting
purposes
can
be
much
worse
there
was
a
question
whether
he
should
not
be
one
of
them
this
nearly
killed
both
the
botseys
the
evil
thing
was
prevented
by
the
timely
pressure
put
on
old
hampton
but
the
excitement
did
our
friend
larry
much
good
bicycle
and
the
other
mare
were
at
once
summered
with
the
greatest
care
and
it
is
generally
understood
that
young
hampton
means
to
depend
upon
larry
very
much
in
regard
to
the
rufford
side
of
the
country
larry
has
bought
goarly
two
fields
goarly
having
altogether
vanished
from
those
parts
and
is
supposed
to
have
dillsborough
wood
altogether
in
his
charge
he
is
frequently
to
be
seen
at
hoppet
hall
calling
there
every
saturday
to
take
down
the
attorney
to
the
dillsborough
club
as
was
his
habit
of
old
but
it
would
perhaps
be
premature
to
say
that
there
are
very
valid
grounds
for
the
hopes
which
masters
already
entertains
in
reference
to
kate
kate
is
still
too
young
and
childish
to
justify
any
prediction
in
that
quarter
what
further
need
be
said
as
to
reginald
and
his
happy
bride
very
little
except
that
in
the
course
of
her
bridal
tour
she
did
gradually
find
words
to
give
him
a
true
and
accurate
account
of
all
her
own
feelings
from
the
time
at
which
he
first
asked
her
to
walk
with
him
across
the
bridge
over
the
dill
and
look
at
the
old
place
they
had
both
passed
their
childish
years
there
but
could
have
but
little
thought
that
they
were
destined
then
to
love
and
grow
old
together
i
was
longing
longing
longing
to
come
she
said
and
why
did
you
come
how
little
you
know
about
girls
of
course
i
had
to
go
with
the
one
i
i
i
well
with
the
one
i
did
not
love
down
to
the
very
soles
of
his
feet
and
then
there
was
the
journey
with
the
parrot
i
rather
liked
the
bird
i
do
know
that
you
said
very
much
but
i
think
you
would
have
said
less
if
there
had
been
no
bird
in
fact
i
have
been
a
fool
all
along
you
were
a
fool
when
you
took
me
out
through
the
orchard
and
caught
me
when
i
jumped
over
the
wall
do
you
remember
when
you
asked
me
all
of
a
sudden
whether
i
should
like
to
be
your
wife
you
were
a
fool
then
but
you
knew
what
was
coming
not
a
bit
of
it
i
knew
it
was
coming
i
had
quite
made
up
my
mind
about
that
i
was
as
sure
of
it
oh
as
sure
of
it
as
i
am
that
i
got
you
now
and
then
it
came
like
a
great
thunderclap
a
thunderclap
mary
well
yes
i
was
quite
sure
at
first
you
might
have
been
laughing
at
me
might
you
just
the
kind
of
joke
for
me
how
was
i
to
understand
it
all
in
a
moment
and
you
made
me
repeat
all
those
words
i
believed
it
then
or
i
should
have
said
them
i
knew
that
must
be
serious
and
so
she
deified
him
and
sat
at
his
feet
looking
up
into
his
eyes
and
fooled
him
for
a
while
into
the
most
perfect
happiness
that
a
man
ever
knows
in
this
world
but
she
was
not
altogether
happy
herself
till
she
had
got
larry
to
come
to
her
at
the
house
at
bragton
and
swear
to
her
that
he
would
be
her
friend
