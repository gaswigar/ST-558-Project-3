prelude
rifts
of
sullen
gray
in
the
dirty
veil
of
vapor
beyond
the
reaches
of
dunes
where
the
sea
in
long
lines
of
white
like
the
ghostly
hosts
of
lost
regiments
clamored
along
the
sand
a
soughing
wind
a
shrieking
of
audible
in
pauses
between
the
faraway
crackle
of
and
the
deep
reverberations
of
artillery
familiar
music
to
ears
trained
by
long
listening
a
shrill
scream
of
flying
shrapnel
a
distant
crash
and
then
a
tense
hush
silence
nearly
but
not
quite
a
sound
so
small
as
to
be
almost
lost
in
the
echoes
of
the
clamor
an
impact
upon
the
air
like
the
tapping
of
the
wings
of
an
insect
against
one
s
a
persistent
staccato
note
which
no
other
noise
could
still
borne
with
curious
distinctness
upon
some
aÃ«rial
current
of
the
fog
bank
and
yet
this
tiny
sound
had
a
strange
effect
upon
the
desolate
scene
for
in
a
moment
as
if
they
had
been
sown
with
dragon
s
teeth
the
sand
dunes
suddenly
vomited
forth
armed
men
who
ran
hither
and
thither
their
hands
to
their
ears
peering
aloft
as

a

out
from

ran
for

the
fog
lifted
a
little
and
a
shaft
of
light
touched
the
leaden
gray
of
the
sea
like
the
sheen
on

the

were

fruitlessly

sounds

to

and
i

abaht
you

that
s
the
sounds
of
firing
rose
and
fell
again
the
fog
thickened
and
the
last
crashes
of
the
guns
echoed
out
to
sea
but
the
rush
of
the
flying
planes
continued
three
machines
there
were
by
the
sound
of
them
but
one
grew
ever
more
distinct
until
the
sounds
of
the
three
were
merged
into
one
closer
it
came
until
like
the
blast
of
a
storm
down
a
mountainside
a
huge
shadow
fell
across
the
dunes
and
was
gone
amid
a
scattering
of
futile
shots
into
the
fog
which
might
as
well
have
been
aimed
at
the
moon

straightened
and
peered
through
the
fog
toward

a
earse
he
muttered
that
s
wot
it
was
a
chapter
i
sheltered
people
lady
betty
heathcote
had
a
reputation
in
which
she
took
pride
for
giving
successful
dinners
in
a
neighborhood
where
successful
dinners
were
a
rule
rather
than
an
exception
her
prescription
was
simple
and
consisted
solely
in
compounding
her
social
elements
by
strenuous
mixing
she
had
a
faculty
for
discovering
cubs
with
incipient
manes
and
saw
them
safely
grown
without
mishap
at
her
house
in
park
lane
politics
art
literature
and
science
rubbed
elbows
here
pictures
had
been
born
plays
had
had
their
real
novels
had
been
devised
and
poems
without
number
not
a
few
of
which
were
indited
to
my
lady
betty
s
eyebrow
here
first
saw
the
light
of
day
for
all
her
dynamic
energy
in
a
variety
of
causes
most
of
them
wise
all
of
them
altruistic
lady
betty
had
the
rare
faculty
of
knowing
when
to
be
restful
tired
cabinet
ministers
overworked
lords
of
the
admiralty
leaders
in
all
parties
knew
that
in
park
lane
there
would
be
no
questions
asked
which
it
would
not
be
possible
to
answer
that
there
was
always
an
excellent
dinner
to
be
had
without
frills
a
lounge
in
a
quiet
room
or
indeed
a
pair
of
pyjamas
and
a
bed
if
necessary
but
since
the
desperate
character
of
the
war
with
germany
had
been
driven
home
into
the
hearts
of
the
people
of
london
a
change
had
taken
place
in
the
complexion
of
many
private
entertainments
and
the
same
serious
air
which
was
to
be
noted
in
the
mien
of
people
of
all
classes
upon
the
street
was
reflected
in
the
faces
of
her
guests
her
scientists
were
engrossed
with
utilitarian
problems
her
literary
men
were
sending
vivid
of
ruined
rheims
and
louvain
to
their
brothers
across
the
atlantic
and
her
cabinet
ministers
conversed
less
than
usual
addressing
themselves
with
a
greater
particularity
to
her
roasts
or
her
spare
bedrooms
torn
between
many
duties
as
patroness
to
bazaars
as
head
of
a
variety
of
sewing
guilds
as
president
of
the
new
association
for
the
training
and
equipment
of
nurses
lady
heathcote
herself
showed
signs
of
the
wear
and
tear
of
an
extraordinary
situation
but
she
managed
to
meet
it
squarely
by
using
every
ounce
of
her
abundant
energy
and
every
faculty
of
her
resourceful
mind
many
secrets
were
hers
both
political
and
departmental
but
she
kept
them
nobly
aware
that
she
lived
in
parlous
times
when
an
unconsidered
word
might
do
a
damage
irreparable
agents
of
the
enemy
she
knew
had
been
discovered
in
every
walk
of
life
and
while
she
lived
in
london
s
innermost
circle
she
knew
that
even
her
own
house
might
not
have
been
immune
from
visitors
whose
secret
motives
were
open
to
question
it
was
therefore
with
the
desire
to
reassure
herself
as
to
the
unadulterated
loyalty
of
her
intimates
that
she
had
carefully
scrutinized
her
dinner
lists
eliminating
all
uncertain
quantities
through
whom
or
by
whom
the
unreserved
character
of
the
conversation
across
her
board
might
in
any
way
be
jeopardized
so
it
was
that
tonight
s
had
something
of
the
complexion
of
a
family
party
in
which
john
rizzio
the
bright
particular
star
in
london
s
firmament
of
art
was
to
lend
his
effulgence
john
rizzio
dean
of
collectors
whose
wonderful
house
in
berkeley
square
rivaled
the
british
museum
and
the
wallace
collection
combined
an
italian
by
birth
an
englishman
by
adoption
who
because
of
his
public
benefactions
had
been
offered
a
knighthood
and
had
refused
it
john
rizzio
who
had
been
an
intimate
of
king
edward
a
friend
of
cabinet
ministers
who
knew
as
much
about
the
inner
workings
of
the
government
as
majesty
itself
long
a
member
of
lady
heathcote
s
circle
it
had
been
her
custom
to
give
him
a
dinner
on
the
anniversary
of
the
day
of
the
acquisition
of
the
most
famous
picture
in
his
collection
the
conningsby
venus
which
had
before
the
death
of
the
old
earl
been
the
aim
of
collectors
throughout
the
world
as
usual
the
selection
of
her
guests
had
been
left
to
rizzio
whose
variety
of
taste
in
friendships
could
have
been
no
better
shown
than
in
the
company
which
now
graced
lady
heathcote
s
table
the
earl
and
countess
of
kipshaven
the
one
artistic
the
other
literary
their
daughter
the
honorable
jacqueline
morley

retired

officer

on

office

interesting
widow

bud
of
whose
new
affections
was
already
emerging
from
her
weeds
john

for
foreign
affairs
the
object
of
those
affections
miss
doris
mather
daughter
of
the
american
cotton
king
who
was
known
for
doing
unusual
things
not
the
least
of
which
was
her
recent
refusal
of
the
hand
of
john
rizzio
one
of
london
s
catches
and
the
acceptance
of
that
of
the
honorable
cyril
hammersley
the
last
to
be
mentioned
member
of
this
distinguished
company
gentleman
sportsman
and
man
about
town
who
as
everybody
knew
would
never
set
the
world
afire
no
one
knew
how
this
miracle
had
happened
for
doris
mather
s
brains
were
above
the
ordinary
she
had
a
discriminating
taste
in
books
and
a
knowledge
of
pictures
and
just
before
dinner
upstairs
in
a
burst
of
confidence
she
had
given
her
surprised
hostess
an
idea
of
what
a
man
should
be
he
should
be
clever
betty
she
sighed
a
worker
a
dreamer
of
great
dreams
a
firebrand
in
every
good
cause
a
patriot
willing
to
fight
to
the
last
drop
of
his
blood
lady
betty
s
laughter
disconcerted
her
and
she
paused
and
that
is
why
you
chose
the
honorable
cyril
miss
mather
compressed
her
lips
and
frowned
at
her
image
in
the
mirror
don
t
be
nasty
betty
i
couldn
t
marry
a
man
as
old
as
john
lady
betty
only
laughed
again
forgive
me
dear
but
it
really
is
most
curious
i
wouldn
t
laugh
if
you
hadn
t
been
so
careful
to
describe
to
me
all
the
virtues
that
cyril
hasn
doris
powdered
the
end
of
her
nose
thoughtfully
i
suppose
they
re
all
a
myth
men
like
that
they
simply
don
t
exist
that
s
lady
betty
pinned
a
final
jewel
on
her
bodice
i
m
sure
john
rizzio
is
flattered
at
your
choice
cyril
is
an
old
dear
but
to
marry
i
d
as
soon
take
the
automatic
chess
player
why
are
you
going
to
marry
cyril
doris
she
asked
a
long
pause
and
more
powder
i
m
not
sure
that
i
am
i
don
t
even
know
why
i
thought
him
possible
i
think
it
s
the
feeling
of
the
potter
for
his
clay
something
be
made
of
him
he
seems
so
helpless
somehow
men
of
his
sort
always
are
i
d
like
to
mother
him
besides
and
she
flashed
around
on
her
hostess
brightly
he
does
sit
a
horse
like
a
he
s
also
an
excellent
shot
a
good
chauffeur
a
tolerable
dancer
and
the
best
bat
in
england
all
agreeable
talents
in
a
gentleman
of
fashion
but
er
hardly
lady
betty
burst
into
laughter
good
lord
doris
cyril
a
firebrand
doris
mather
eyed
her
hostess
reproachfully
and
moved
toward
the
door
into
the
hallway
come
betty
she
said
with
some
dignity
are
you
ready
to
go
down
all
of
which
goes
to
show
that
matches
are
not
made
in
heaven
and
that
the
motives
of
young
women
in
making
important
decisions
are
actuated
by
the
most
unimportant
details
hammersley
s
good
fortune
was
still
a
secret
except
to
miss
mather
s
most
intimate
friends
but
the
conviction
was
slowly
growing
in
the
mind
of
the
girl
that
unless
cyril
stopped
sitting
around
in
tweeds
when
everybody
else
was
getting
into
khaki
the
engagement
would
never
be
announced
as
the
foreign
situation
had
grown
more
serious
she
had
seen
other
men
who
weighed
less
than
cyril
throw
off
the
boredom
of
their
london
habits
and
go
soldiering
into
france
but
the
desperate
need
of
his
country
for
men
had
apparently
made
no
impression
upon
the
placid
mind
of
the
honorable
cyril
it
was
as
unruffled
as
a
highland
lake
in
he
had
contributed
liberally
from
his
large
means
to
lady
heathcote
s
ambulance
fund
but
his
manner
had
become
if
anything
more
bored
than
ever
miss
mather
entered
the
thoughtfully
with
the
helpless
feeling
of
one
who
having
made
a
mistake
pauses
between
the
alternatives
of
tenacity
and
recantation
and
yet
as
soon
as
she
saw
him
a
little
tremor
of
pleasure
passed
over
her
in
spite
of
his
drooping
pose
his
vacant
stare
his
obvious
inadequacy
she
was
sure
there
was
something
about
cyril
hammersley
that
made
him
beyond
doubt
the
most
person
in
the
room
not
even
excepting
rizzio
he
came
over
to
her
at
once
the
monocle
dropping
from
his
eye
aw
fly
glad
jolly
good
to
see
you
m
dear
handsome
no
he
took
her
hand
and
bent
over
her
fingers
such
a
broad
back
he
had
such
a
finely
shaped
head
such
shoulders
such
strong
hands
that
were
capable
of
so
much
but
had
achieved
so
little
and
were
these
all
that
she
could
have
seen
in
him
reason
told
her
that
it
was
her
mind
that
demanded
a
mate
could
it
be
that
she
was
in
love
with
a
beautiful
body
there
was
something
pathetic
in
the
way
he
looked
at
her
she
felt
very
sorry
for
him
but
betty
heathcote
s
laughter
was
still
ringing
in
her
ears
thanks
cyril
she
said
coolly
i
ve
wanted
to
see
you
tonight
to
tell
you
that
at
last
i
ve
volunteered
with
the
red
hammersley
peered
at
her
blankly
and
then
with
a
contortion
set
his
eyeglass
red
cross
you
oh
i
say
now
doris
that
s
goin
it
rather
thick
on
a
chap
it
s
true
father
s
fitting
out
an
ambulance
corps
and
has
promised
to
let
me
john
rizzio
tall
urbane
dark
and
cynical
who
had
joined
them
heard
her
last
words
and
broke
into
a
shrug
it
s
the
khaki
hammersley
the
women
will
follow
it
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
broadcloth
and
tweeds
are
not
the
he
ran
his
arm
through
hammersley
s
there
s
nothing
for
you
and
me
but
to
the
honorable
cyril
only
stared
at
him
blankly
haw
he
said
which
as
lady
betty
once
expressed
it
was
half
the
note
of
a
jackass
here
the
kipshavens
arrived
and
their
hostess
signaled
the
advance
upon
the
one
of
the
secrets
of
the
success
of
lady
heathcote
s
dinners
was
the
size
and
shape
of
her
table
which
seated
no
more
than
ten
and
was
round
her
centerpieces
were
flat
and
her
candelabra
low
so
that
any
person
at
the
table
could
see
and
converse
with
anyone
else
it
was
thus
possible
delicately
to
remind
those
who
insisted
on
completely
appropriating
their
dinner
partners
that
private
matters
could
be
much
more
safely
discussed
in
the
many
corners
of
the
house
designed
for
the
purpose
doris
sat
between
rizzio
and
byfield
hammersley
with
lady
joyliffe
just
opposite
and
when
rizzio
announced
the
american
girl
s
decision
to
go
to
france
as
soon
as
her
training
was
completed
she
became
the
immediate
center
of
interest
that
s
neutrality
of
the
right
sort
said
kipshaven
heartily
i
wish
all
of
your
countrymen
felt
as
you
i
think
most
of
them
do
replied
doris
smiling
slowly
but
you
know
you
haven
t
always
been
nice
to
us
there
have
been
many
times
when
we
felt
that
as
an
older
brother
you
treated
us
rather
shabbily
i
m
heaping
coals
of
fire
you
said
rizzio
with
a
laugh
i
bare
my
head
said
the
earl
ashes
to
ashes
from
lady
joyliffe
kipshaven
smiled
once
in
england
gray
hairs
were
venerated
even
among
the
frivolous
now
he
sighed
they
are
only
a
reproach
forgive
me
i
wish
i
could
set
the
clock
you
d
go
asked
doris
tomorrow
said
the
old
earl
with
enthusiasm
miss
mather
glanced
at
hammersley
who
was
enjoying
his
soup
a
purÃ©e
he
liked
particularly
but
isn
t
there
something
you
could
do
yes
write
for
america
for
italy
for
sweden
and
holland
for
spain
it
s
something
but
it
isn
t
enough
my
fingers
are
itching
for
a
the
honorable
cyril
looked
up
pen
mightier
than
sword
he
quoted
vacuously
and
went
on
with
his
soup
you
don
t
really
mean
that
hammersley
said
kipshaven
amid
smiles
well
rather
drawled
the
other
all
silly
rot
fightin
what
s
the
use
spoiled
my
in
no
season
at
carlsbad
no
season
anywhere
everything
the
same
winter
summer
you
wouldn
t
think
so
if
you
were
in
the
trenches
my
boy
laughed
byfield
beastly
happy
i
m
not
said
hammersley
don
t
mind
shootin
pheasant
or
boar
bad
form
shootin
men
not
the
sportin
thing
you
know
pottin
a
bird
on
the
ground
specially
said
lady
betty
contemptuously
she
was
inclined
to
be
intolerant
for
her
algy
had
already
been
mentioned
in
dispatches
i
don
t
understand
you
hammersley
regarded
her
gravely
while
constance
joyliffe
took
up
his
cudgels
you
forget
cyril
s
four
years
at
no
i
don
t
said
their
hostess
warmly
and
i
could
almost
believe
cyril
had
german
i
have
you
know
said
hammersley
calmly
sniffing
at
the
rim
of
his
wineglass
this
is
hardly
the
time
to
confess
it
said
kipshaven
dryly
doris
sat
silent
aware
of
a
deep
humiliation
which
seemed
to
envelop
them
both
rizzio
laughed
and
produced
a
clipping
from
hammersley
is
merely
stoically
peaceful
and
he
read
i
was
playing
golf
one
day
when
the
germans
landed
all
our
troops
had
run
away
and
all
our
ships
were
stranded
and
the
thought
of
england
s
shame
nearly
put
me
off
my
amid
the
laughter
the
honorable
cyril
straightened
silly
stuff
that
he
said
quite
seriously
to
put
a
fellow
off
his
and
turning
to
lady
joyliffe
a
bit
brackish
lately
what
cyril
you
re
insular
from
lady
heathcote
no
insulated
said
doris
with
a
flash
of
the
eyes
rizzio
laughed
highly
potential
but
er
not
dangerous
why
should
he
be
he
s
your
typical
briton
calm
and
nerveless
in
the
most
exacting
situations
i
was
at
lords
you
know
when
hammersley
made
that
winning
run
for
marylebone
two
minutes
to
play
every
bowler
they
put
up
it
s
hardly
a
time
for
bats
put
in
kipshaven
dryly
what
we
need
is
fast
bowlers
with
the
object
of
these
remarks
sat
serenely
smiling
blandly
around
the
table
but
made
no
reply
in
the
pause
that
followed
sandys
was
heard
in
a
half
whisper
to
byfield
what
s
this
i
hear
of
a
leak
at
the
war
office
captain
byfield
glanced
down
the
table
have
you
heard
that
yes
at
the
captain
byfield
touched
the
rim
of
his
glass
to
his
lips
i
ve
heard
nothing
of
what
from
a
chorus
information
is
getting
out
somewhere
i
violate
no
confidences
in
telling
you
the
war
office
is
how
terrible
said
lady
joyliffe
and
don
t
they
suspect
that
s
the
worst
of
it
the
germans
got
wind
of
some
of
lord
kitchener
s
plans
and
some
of
the
admiralty
s
which
nobody
knew
but
those
very
near
the
men
at
the
a
spy
in
that
circle
unbelievable
said
kipshaven
my
authority
is
a
man
of
importance
fortunately
no
damage
has
been
done
the
story
goes
that
we
re
issuing
false
statements
in
certain
channels
to
mislead
the
enemy
and
find
the
but
how
does
the
news
reach
the
germans
asked
rizzio
no
one
knows
by
courier
to
the
coast
and
then
by
fast
perhaps
or
by
aÃ«roplane
it
s
very
mysterious
a
huge
yellow
in
color
flying
over
the
north
sea
between
england
and
the
continent
has
been
sighted
and
reported
by
english
vessels
again
and
again
and
each
flight
has
coincided
with
some
unexpected
move
on
the
part
of
the
enemy
once
it
was
seen
just
before
the
raid
at
falmouth
again
before
the
zeppelin
visit
to
a
yellow
dove
said
lady
kipshaven
a
bird
of
ill
omen
but
how
could
such
an
aÃ«roplane
leave
the
shores
of
england
without
being
remarked
asked
kipshaven
oh
laughed
sandys
answer
me
that
and
we
have
the
solution
of
the
problem
a
strict
watch
is
being
kept
on
the
coasts
and
the
government
employees
the
postmen
police
men
of
every
town
and
village
from
here
to
the
shetlands
are
on
the
lookout
but
not
a
glimpse
have
they
had
of
him
not
a
sign
of
his
arrival
or
departure
but
only
last
week
he
was
reported
by
a
destroyer
flying
toward
the
english
most
extraordinary
from
lady
kipshaven
it
s
a
large
machine
asked
rizzio
larger
than
any
aÃ«roplane
ever
built
in
europe
they
say
curtis
the
american
was
building
a
thousand
horsepower
machine
at
hammondsport
in
the
states
this
one
must
be
at
least
as
large
as
but
surely
such
a
machine
could
not
be
hidden
in
england
for
any
length
of
time
without
it
would
seem
so
but
there
you
are
the
main
point
is
that
he
hasn
t
been
discovered
and
that
its
pilot
is
here
in
england
ready
to
fly
across
the
sea
with
our
military
secrets
when
he
gets
d
n
him
growled
kipshaven
quite
audibly
a
sentiment
which
echoed
so
truly
in
the
hearts
of
those
present
that
it
passed
without
comment
the
captain
of
a
merchant
steamer
who
saw
it
quite
plainly
reported
that
the
power
of
the
machine
was
simply
amazing
that
it
flew
at
about
six
thousand
feet
and
was
lost
to
sight
in
an
incredibly
brief
time
in
short
my
friends
the
yellow
dove
is
one
of
the
miracles
of
the
day
and
its
pilot
one
of
its
but
our
aviation
men
can
they
do
nothing
what
chase
rainbows
where
shall
their
voyage
begin
and
where
end
he
s
over
the
north
sea
one
minute
and
in
belgium
the
next
our
troops
in
the
trenches
think
he
s
a
phantom
they
say
even
the
bombs
he
drops
are
phantoms
they
are
heard
to
explode
but
nobody
has
ever
been
hit
by
what
will
the
war
office
do
sandys
shrugged
expressively
what
would
do
shoot
the
beggar
said
the
honorable
cyril
impassively
shoot
the
moon
sir
roared
the
earl
angrily
it
s
no
time
for
idiotic
remarks
if
this
story
is
true
a
danger
hangs
over
england
no
wholesome
briton
here
he
glanced
again
at
hammersley
ought
to
go
to
sleep
until
this
menace
is
discovered
and
the
yellow
dove
is
occult
said
sandys
like
a
witch
on
a
a
flying
dutchman
returned
lady
joyliffe
there
seems
to
be
no
joke
about
that
said
the
earl
chapter
ii
the
undercurrent
they
were
still
discussing
the
strange
story
of
sandys
when
lady
heathcote
signaled
her
feminine
guests
and
they
retired
to
the
over
the
coffee
the
interest
persisted
and
lord
kipshaven
was
not
to
be
denied
if
as
it
seemed
probable
this
german
spy
was
making
frequent
flights
between
england
and
the
continent
he
must
have
some
landing
field
a
hangar
a
machine
shop
with
supplies
of
oil
and
fuel
where
in
this
tight
little
island
could
a
german
airman
descend
with
a
thousand
horsepower
machine
and
not
be
discovered
unless
with
the
connivance
of
englishmen
the
thing
looked
bad
if
there
were
englishmen
in
high
places
in
london
who
could
be
bought
there
were
others
many
others
who
helped
to
form
the
vicious
chain
which
led
to
germany
i
tell
you
i
believe
we
re
honeycombed
with
spies
he
growled
for
one
that
we
ve
caught
and
imprisoned
or
shot
there
are
dozens
in
the
very
midst
of
us
if
this
thing
keeps
up
we
ll
all
of
us
be
suspecting
one
another
how
do
i
know
that
you
sandys
you
rizzio
byfield
or
even
hammersley
here
isn
t
a
secret
agent
of
the
germans
what
in
england
is
safe
when
spies
are
found
in
the
official
family
at
the
war
office
rizzio
smiled
we
who
are
about
to
die
salute
you
he
said
raising
his
liqueur
glass
and
you
lord
kipshaven
how
can
we
be
sure
of
you
by
this
token
said
the
old
man
rising
and
putting
his
back
to
the
fire
that
if
i
even
suspected
i
d
shoot
any
one
of
you
down
here
now
with
as
little
compunction
as
i
d
kill
a
i
ll
have
my
coffee
first
laughed
byfield
if
you
don
t
coffee
then
coffin
said
rizzio
jolly
unpleasant
conversation
this
remarked
hammersley
makes
a
chap
a
bit
fidgety
roared
the
earl
we
ought
to
be
fidgety
with
the
germans
winning
east
and
west
and
the
finest
flower
of
our
service
already
killed
in
battle
we
need
men
and
still
more
men
any
fellow
under
forty
who
stays
at
home
and
he
glanced
meaningly
at
the
honorable
cyril
ought
to
be
put
to
work
mending
the
object
of
these
remarks
turned
the
blank
stare
of
his
monocle
but
made
no
reply
yes
i
mean
you
cyril
went
on
the
earl
steadily
your
mother
was
born
a
prussian
i
knew
her
well
and
i
think
she
learned
to
thank
god
that
fortune
had
given
her
an
englishman
for
a
husband
but
the
taint
is
in
you
your
brother
has
been
wounded
at
the
front
his
blood
is
cleansed
but
what
of
yours
you
went
to
a
german
university
with
your
prussian
kinsmen
and
now
openly
flaunt
your
sympathies
at
a
dinner
of
british
patriots
speak
up
how
do
you
stand
your
friends
demand
hammersley
turned
his
cigarette
carefully
in
its
long
amber
holder
oh
i
say
lord
kipshaven
he
said
with
a
slow
smile
you
re
not
spoofing
a
chap
are
you
i
was
never
more
in
earnest
in
my
life
how
do
you
stand
haw
said
hammersley
with
obvious
effort
i
m
british
you
know
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
how
can
an
englishman
be
anything
else
silly
rot
fightin
that
s
what
i
say
that
s
all
i
say
he
finished
looking
calmly
for
approval
from
one
to
the
other
smiles
from
sandys
and
rizzio
met
this
inadequacy
but
the
earl
after
glaring
at
him
moodily
for
a
moment
uttered
a
smothered
paugh
and
shrugging
a
shoulder
turned
to
rizzio
and
sandys
who
were
discussing
a
recent
submarine
raid
hammersley
and
byfield
sat
near
each
other
at
the
side
of
the
table
away
from
the
others
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
which
hammersley
improved
by
blowing
smoke
rings
toward
the
ceiling
captain
byfield
watched
him
a
moment
and
then
after
a
glance
in
the
direction
of
the
earl
leaned
carelessly
on
an
elbow
toward
hammersley
any
shootin
at
the
north
he
asked
hammersley
s
monocle
dropped
and
the
eyes
of
the
two
men
met
yes
i
m
shootin
the
day
after
tomorrow
said
hammersley
quietly
byfield
looked
away
and
another
long
moment
of
silence
followed
then
the
honorable
cyril
after
a
puff
or
two
took
the
long
amber
holder
from
his
mouth
removed
the
cigarette
and
smudged
the
ash
upon
the
receiver
bally
heady
cigarettes
these
of
algy
s
don
t
happen
to
have
any
baccy
and
papers
about
you
do
you
byfield
well
rather
replied
the
captain
and
he
pushed
a
pouch
and
a
package
of
cigarette
papers
along
the
tablecloth
it
s
a
mix
of
my
own
i
hope
you
ll
like
hammersley
opened
the
bag
and
sniffed
at
its
contents
good
stuff
that
virginia
perique
and
a
bit
of
turkish
what
byfield
nodded
and
watched
hammersley
as
he
poured
out
the
tobacco
rolled
the
paper
and
lighted
it
at
the
candelabra
inhaling
luxuriously
thanks
he
sighed
jolly
good
of
you
and
he
pushed
the
pouch
back
to
byfield
along
the
table
you
must
come
to
scotland
some
day
old
chap
said
the
honorable
cyril
carelessly
delighted
when
the
war
is
over
returned
byfield
quietly
not
until
the
war
is
awf
ly
glad
to
have
you
any
time
you
know
awf
ly
in
case
of
furlough
i
ll
look
you
do
said
the
honorable
cyril
hammersley
s
rather
bovine
gaze
passed
slowly
around
the
room
and
just
over
lord
kipshaven
s
head
in
the
mirror
over
the
mantel
it
met
the
dark
gaze
of
john
rizzio
the
fraction
of
a
second
it
paused
there
and
then
he
stretched
his
long
legs
and
rose
stifling
a
yawn
let
s
go
in
what
he
said
to
byfield
byfield
got
up
and
at
the
same
time
there
was
a
movement
at
the
mantel
don
t
be
too
hard
on
the
chap
rizzio
was
saying
in
an
undertone
to
kipshaven
you
re
singing
the
he
s
harmless
i
tell
you
positively
and
then
as
the
others
moved
toward
the
door
come
lady
heathcote
won
t
mind
our
hammersley
led
the
way
with
byfield
and
rizzio
at
his

jacqueline
morley
had
been
trying
to
play
the
piano
but
there
was
no
heart
in
the
music
until
she
struck
up
tipperary
when
there
was
a
generous
chorus
in
which
the
men
joined
hammersley
found
doris
with
constance
joyliffe
in
an
alcove
at
his
approach
lady
joyliffe
retired
handsome
no
end
he
murmured
to
her
as
he
sank
beside
her
handsome
is
as
handsome
does
cyril
she
said
slowly
if
you
knew
what
i
was
thinking
of
you
wouldn
t
be
so
what
just
what
everybody
is
thinking
about
you
that
you
ve
got
to
do
something
enlist
to
fight
go
to
france
if
only
as
a
chauffeur
they
d
let
you
do
that
tomorrow
if
you
d
chauffeur
me
not
really
yes
that
or
something
else
determinedly
why
she
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
went
on
distinctly
because
i
could
never
marry
a
man
people
talked
about
as
people
are
talking
about
not
marry
the
honorable
cyril
s
face
for
the
first
time
that
evening
showed
an
expression
of
concern
not
marry
me
you
can
t
mean
that
i
do
mean
it
cyril
she
said
firmly
i
can
t
marry
why
because
to
me
love
is
a
sacrament
love
of
woman
love
of
country
but
the
last
is
the
greater
of
the
two
no
man
who
isn
t
a
patriot
is
fit
to
be
a
a
patriot
she
broke
in
before
he
could
protest
yes
a
patriot
you
re
not
a
patriot
that
is
if
you
re
an
englishman
i
don
t
know
you
cyril
you
puzzle
me
you
re
lukewarm
day
after
day
you
ve
seen
your
friends
and
mine
go
off
in
uniform
but
it
doesn
t
mean
anything
to
you
it
doesn
t
mean
anything
to
you
that
england
is
in
danger
and
that
she
needs
every
man
who
can
be
spared
at
home
to
go
to
the
front
you
see
them
go
and
the
only
thing
it
means
to
you
is
that
you
re
losing
and
instead
of
taking
the
infection
of
fervor
you
go
to
scotland
to
shoot
not
germans
but
deer
deer
she
repeated
scathingly
but
there
aren
t
any
germans
in
scotland
at
least
none
that
a
chap
could
shoot
he
said
with
a
smile
then
go
where
there
germans
to
shoot
she
said
impetuously
she
put
her
face
to
her
hands
a
moment
oh
don
t
you
understand
you
ve
got
to
prove
yourself
you
ve
got
to
make
people
stop
speaking
of
you
as
i
ve
heard
them
speak
of
you
tonight
here
you
are
in
the
midst
of
friends
people
who
know
you
and
like
you
but
what
must
other
people
who
don
t
know
you
so
well
or
care
so
much
as
we
what
must
they
think
and
say
of
your
indifference
of
your
openly
expressed
sympathy
with
england
s
enemies
even
lady
betty
a
kinswoman
and
one
of
your
truest
friends
has
lost
patience
with
you
i
had
almost
said
lost
confidence
in
her
voice
trailed
into
silence
hammersley
was
moving
the
toe
of
his
varnished
boot
along
the
border
of
the
aubusson
rug
i
m
sorry
he
said
slowly
awf
ly
sorry
are
you
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
do
he
said
vaguely
i
don
t
know
i
m
sure
i
m
no
bally
use
you
know
wouldn
t
be
any
bally
use
over
there
make
some
silly
ass
mistake
probably
no
end
of
trouble
all
and
you
re
willing
to
sacrifice
the
goodwill
the
affection
of
your
friends
the
respect
of
the
girl
you
say
you
love
oh
i
say
doris
not
that
yes
i
ve
got
to
tell
you
i
can
t
be
unfair
to
myself
i
can
t
respect
a
man
who
sees
others
cheerfully
carrying
burdens
doing
work
accepting
hardships
in
order
that
he
may
sleep
soundly
at
home
far
away
from
the
nightmare
of
shot
and
shell
cyril
is
it
that
the
love
of
ease
or
is
it
something
else
something
to
do
with
your
german
kinship
the
memory
of
your
mother
what
is
it
if
you
still
want
me
cyril
it
is
my
right
to
know
want
you
doris
his
voice
went
a
little
lower
yes
i
want
you
you
might
know
then
you
must
tell
he
hesitated
and
peered
at
the
eyeglass
in
his
fingers
i
think
it
s
because
i
he
paused
and
then
crossed
his
hands
and
bowed
his
head
with
an
air
of
relinquishment
because
i
think
i
must
be
a
he
almost
whispered
the
word
a
doris
mather
gazed
at
him
a
long
moment
of
mingled
dismay
and
incredulity
you
she
whispered
the
first
sportsman
of
england
a
a
he
gave
a
short
mirthless
laugh
queer
isn
t
it
the
way
a
chap
feels
about
such
things
i
always
hated
the
idea
of
being
mangled
awf
ly
unpleasant
idea
that
specially
in
the
tummy
in
india
once
i
saw
a
chap
you
a
coward
doris
repeated
i
don
t
believe
he
bent
his
head
again
i
i
m
afraid
you
d
better
he
said
uncertainly
she
rose
still
looking
at
him
incredulously
another
doubt
a
more
dreadful
one
winging
its
flight
to
and
fro
across
her
inner
vision
come
she
said
in
a
tone
she
hardly
recognized
as
her
own
come
let
us
join
the
he
stood
uncertainly
and
as
she
started
to
go
you
ll
let
me
take
you
home
doris
he
asked
she
bent
her
head
and
without
replying
made
her
way
to
the
group
beyond
the
alcove
hammersley
stood
a
moment
watching
her
diminishing
back
and
then
a
curious
expression
half
of
trouble
half
of
resolution
came
into
his
eyes
then
after
a
quick
glance
around
the
curtain
he
suddenly
reached
into
his
trousers
pocket
took
something
out
and
scrutinized
it
carefully
by
the
light
of
the
lamp
he
put
it
back
quickly
and
setting
his
monocle
sauntered
forth
into
the
room
as
he
moved
to
join
the
group
at
the
piano
john
rizzio
met
him
in
the
middle
of
the
room
could
i
have
a
word
with
you
hammersley
he
asked
happy
said
the
honorable
cyril
here
in
the
if
you
don
t
mind
hammersley
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
swung
on
his
heels
and
led
the
way
at
the
door
from
the
hallway
rizzio
paused
then
quietly
drew
the
heavy
curtains
behind
them
hammersley
standing
by
the
table
followed
this
action
with
a
kind
of
bored
curiosity
aware
that
rizzio
s
dark
gaze
had
never
once
left
him
since
they
had
entered
the
room
slowly
hammersley
took
his
hands
from
his
pockets
reached
into
his
waistcoat
for
his
cigarette
case
and
as
rizzio
approached
opened
and
offered
it
to
him
smoke
he
asked
carelessly
i
don
t
mind
if
i
do
but
i
ve
taken
a
curious
liking
for
rolled
cigarettes
ah
i
thought
he
opened
the
tobacco
jar
and
sniffed
at
it
searched
around
the
articles
on
the
table
then
how
disappointing
nothing
but
algy
s
dreadful
pipes
you
don
t
happen
to
have
any
do
you
hammersley
was
lighting
his
own
cigarette
at
the
brazier
no
sorry
he
replied
laconically
rizzio
leaned
beside
him
against
the
edge
of
the
table
strange
i
thought
i
saw
you
making
a
cigarette
in
the
hammersley
s
face
brightened
oh
yes
byfield
byfield
has
i
d
rather
have
yours
he
said
quietly
the
honorable
cyril
looked
up
mine
old
chap
i
thought
i
told
you
i
hadn
t
rizzio
smiled
amiably
then
i
must
have
misunderstood
you
he
said
politely
yes
said
hammersley
and
sank
into
an
armchair
rizzio
did
not
move
and
the
honorable
cyril
his
head
back
was
already
blowing
smoke
rings
rizzio
suddenly
relaxed
with
a
laugh
and
put
his
legs
over
a
small
chair
near
hammersley
s
and
folded
his
arms
along
its
back
do
you
know
hammersley
he
said
with
a
laugh
i
sometimes
think
that
as
i
grow
older
my
hearing
is
not
as
good
as
it
used
to
be
perhaps
you
ll
say
that
i
cling
to
my
vanishing
youth
with
a
fatuous
desperation
i
do
rather
silly
isn
t
it
because
i
m
quite
but
i
ve
a
curiosity
even
in
so
small
a
matter
to
learn
whether
things
are
as
bad
with
me
as
i
think
they
are
now
unless
you
re
going
to
add
a
few
more
gray
hairs
to
my
head
by
telling
me
that
i
m
losing
my
sight
as
well
as
my
hearing
you
ll
gratify
my
curiosity
an
idle
curiosity
if
you
like
but
still
strangely
important
to
my
peace
of
he
paused
a
moment
and
looked
at
cyril
who
was
examining
him
with
frank
bewilderment
i
don
t
think
i
understand
said
hammersley
politely
i
ll
try
to
make
it
clearer
something
has
happened
tonight
that
makes
me
think
that
i
m
getting
either
blind
or
deaf
or
both
to
begin
with
i
thought
you
said
you
had
no
cigarette
papers
if
i
heard
you
wrong
then
the
burden
of
proof
rests
upon
my
ears
if
my
eyes
are
at
fault
it
s
high
time
i
consulted
a
specialist
because
you
know
at
the
table
in
the
when
you
were
sitting
with
byfield
quite
distinctly
i
saw
you
put
a
package
of
into
your
trousers
pocket
the
color
as
you
know
is
yellow
a
color
to
which
my
optic
nerve
is
peculiarly
he
laughed
again
i
know
you
d
hardly
go
out
of
your
way
to
make
a
misstatement
on
so
small
a
matter
and
if
you
don
t
mind
satisfying
a
foible
of
my
vanity
i
wish
you
d
tell
me
whether
or
not
i
m
he
stopped
and
looked
at
hammersley
who
was
regarding
him
with
polite
if
puzzled
tolerance
then
as
if
realizing
that
something
was
required
of
him
hammersley
leaned
forward
i
say
rizzio
what
the
deuce
is
it
all
about
i
m
sorry
you
re
gettin
old
an
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
i
can
t
help
it
now
can
i
old
chap
rizzio
s
smile
slowly
faded
and
his
gaze
passed
hammersley
and
rested
on
the
brass
fender
of
the
fireplace
you
don
t
care
to
tell
me
he
asked
what
about
that
package
of
byfield
has
not
that
package
put
in
rizzio
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
and
then
leaning
forward
in
a
low
tone
the
hammersley
sat
upright
a
moment
his
hands
on
the
and
then
sank
back
in
his
chair
with
a
laugh
i
say
i
can
take
a
joke
as
well
as
the
next
but
er
what
s
the
answer
rizzio
rose
his
graceful
figure
dominant
i
don
t
think
that
sort
of
thing
will
do
his
demeanor
was
perfectly
correct
his
easy
and
a
smile
flickered
at
his
lips
but
his
tone
masked
a
mystery
hammersley
rose
removing
his
cigarette
with
great
deliberateness
from
its
holder
and
throwing
it
into
the
fire
if
there
isn
t
anything
else
you
want
to
see
me
about
he
took
a
step
in
the
direction
of
the
door
one
moment
hammersley
paused
i
think
we
d
better
drop
subterfuge
i
know
why
you
were
here
tonight
why
byfield
was
here
and
perhaps
you
know
now
why
i
am
can
t
imagine
i
m
sure
said
cyril
perhaps
you
can
guess
when
i
tell
you
that
this
party
was
of
my
own
choosing
that
my
plans
were
made
with
a
view
to
arranging
your
meeting
with
captain
byfield
in
a
place
known
to
be
above
suspicion
i
have
been
empowered
to
relieve
you
of
any
further
responsibility
in
the
matter
in
question
in
short
of
the
papers
oh
i
say
vanished
youth
cigarette
papers
and
all
that
you
re
goin
it
a
bit
thick
rizzio
old
rizzio
put
a
hand
into
the
inside
pocket
of
his
evening
coat
and
drew
out
a
which
he
opened
under
hammersley
s
eyes
look
hammersley
he
whispered
maxwell
gave
me
this
perhaps
you
understand
the
honorable
cyril
fixed
his
eyeglass
carefully
and
stared
at
the
by
jove
he
muttered
with
sudden
interest
now
you
understand
said
rizzio
you
whispered
hammersley
looking
at
him
the
languor
of
a
moment
before
had
fallen
from
him
with
his
dropping
monocle
yes
i
now
quick
the
papers
muttered
rizzio
putting
the
in
his
pocket
someone
may
come
at
any
for
a
long
space
of
time
hammersley
stood
uncertainly
peering
down
at
the
pattern
in
the
rug
then
he
straightened
and
crossing
the
room
put
his
back
to
the
fireplace
there
may
be
a
mistake
he
said
firmly
i
can
t
risk
rizzio
stood
for
a
moment
staring
at
him
as
though
he
had
not
heard
correctly
then
he
crossed
over
and
faced
the
other
man
you
mean
that
hammersley
put
his
hands
in
his
trousers
pockets
i
fancy
what
are
you
going
to
do
what
i
ve
been
told
to
my
orders
supersede
i
m
not
you
can
t
doubt
my
hardly
that
er
i
think
i
know
best
that
s
rizzio
took
a
pace
or
two
before
the
fireplace
in
front
of
him
his
brows
tangled
his
fingers
twitching
behind
his
back
then
he
stopped
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
has
reached
a
decision
you
understand
what
this
refusal
means
hammersley
shrugged
you
realize
that
it
makes
you
an
object
of
suspicion
asked
the
other
how
in
doing
what
was
expected
of
me
said
hammersley
easily
you
are
expected
to
give
those
papers
to
i
can
rizzio
s
fine
face
had
gone
a
shade
paler
under
the
glossy
black
of
his
hair
and
his
eyes
gleamed
dangerously
under
his
shaggy
brows
he
measured
the
honorable
cyril
s
six
feet
two
against
his
own
and
then
turned
away
i
think
i
understand
he
said
slowly
your
action
leaves
me
no
other
hammersley
his
hands
still
deep
in
his
pockets
seemed
to
be
thinking
deeply
oh
i
wouldn
t
say
that
each
man
according
to
his
lights
you
have
your
orders
i
have
mine
they
seem
to
conflict
i
m
going
to
carry
mine
out
if
that
interferes
with
carrying
out
yours
i
m
not
to
blame
it
s
what
happens
in
the
end
that
matters
he
finished
significantly
rizzio
thought
deeply
for
a
moment
you
ll
at
least
let
me
see
them
no
i
can
why
i
have
my
own
another
pause
in
which
rizzio
gave
every
appearance
of
a
baffled
man
you
realize
that
if
i
gave
the
alarm
and
those
papers
were
found
on
you
you
wouldn
t
do
why
not
because
of
your
that
signifies
nothing
to
anyone
but
you
and
hammersley
smiled
i
ll
take
the
risk
rizzio
he
said
finally
the
two
men
had
been
so
absorbed
in
their
conversation
that
they
had
not
heard
the
drawing
of
the
curtains
of
the
door
but
a
sound
made
them
turn
and
there
stood
doris
mather
chapter
iii
doris
looked
from
the
man
whose
hand
she
had
accepted
to
the
one
she
had
refused
their
attitudes
were
eloquent
of
concealment
and
the
few
phrases
which
had
reached
her
ears
as
she
paused
outside
the
curtain
did
nothing
to
relieve
the
sudden
tension
of
her
fears
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
as
rizzio
recovered
himself
with
an
effort
do
come
in
doris
he
said
with
a
smile
hammersley
and
i
were
er
discussing
the
scrap
of
paper
i
m
sure
of
it
she
said
coolly
nothing
is
so
fruitful
of
argument
i
shouldn
t
have
intruded
but
cyril
was
to
take
me
home
and
i
m
ready
to
a
look
passed
between
the
men
by
jove
of
course
said
cyril
with
a
glance
at
his
watch
if
you
ll
excuse
me
rizzio
betty
is
going
to
scotland
tomorrow
early
and
i
think
she
wants
to
go
to
rizzio
laughed
the
war
has
made
us
virtuous
eleven
o
clock
we
re
losing
our
beauty
he
followed
them
to
the
door
but
pleading
a
desire
for
a
remained
in
the
i
promised
that
you
should
take
me
home
said
the
girl
to
hammersley
as
they
passed
along
the
hall
but
i
m
sorry
if
i
interrupted
awf
ly
glad
he
murmured
nothing
important
you
know
club
matter
doris
stopped
just
outside
the
door
and
searched
his
face
keenly
while
she
whispered
and
the
threats
of
exposure
oh
i
heard
that
i
couldn
t
help
it
cyril
he
glanced
down
at
her
quickly
hush
something
she
saw
in
his
expression
changed
her
resolution
to
question
him
the
mystery
which
she
had
felt
to
hang
about
him
since
he
had
said
he
was
a
coward
had
deepened
something
told
her
that
she
had
been
treading
on
forbidden
ground
and
that
in
obeying
him
she
served
his
interests
best
so
she
led
the
way
into
the
where
they
made
their
adieux
byfield
had
already
gone
and
sandys
and
lady
joyliffe
were
just
getting
into
their
wraps
you
ll
meet
me
here
at
ten
their
hostess
was
asking
of
constance
joyliffe
if
i
m
not
demolished
by
a
zeppelin
in
the
meanwhile
laughed
the
widow
or
the
yellow
dove
said
jacqueline
morley
i
m
he
alights
on
the
roofs
of
the
parliament
you
ll
be
safe
in
scotland
at
any
rate
constance
we
re
quite
too
unimportant
up
there
to
be
visited
by
engines
of
destruction
she
laughed
meaningly
that
is
always
excepting
jack
sandys
looked
but
lady
joyliffe
merely
beamed
benignly
it
will
really
be
quite
restful
i
m
sure
she
said
easily
is
cyril
going
to
be
at
hammersley
awoke
from
a
fit
of
abstraction
quite
possible
he
murmured
gettin
to
be
a
bit
of
a
hermit
lately
like
it
though
cyril
hasn
t
anyone
to
play
with
said
betty
heathcote
so
he
has
taken
to
building
fearfully
absorbin
workin
em
out
on
a
plan
of
my
own
you
ll
see
goin
in
for
hens
to
lay
two
eggs
a
and
then
to
kipshaven
so
the
submarines
can
t
starve
us
out
you
know
he
explained
i
don
t
think
you
need
worry
about
that
said
the
earl
dryly
moving
toward
the
door
doris
mather
went
upstairs
for
her
wraps
and
when
she
came
down
she
found
hammersley
in
his
topcoat
awaiting
her
as
they
went
down
the
steps
into
the
waiting
limousine
her
companion
offered
her
his
arm
was
it
only
fancy
that
gave
her
the
impression
that
his
glance
was
searching
the
darkness
of
the
park
beyond
the
lights
of
the
waiting
cars
with
a
keenness
which
seemed
uncalled
for
on
so
prosaic
an
occasion
he
helped
her
in
and
gave
the
direction
to
the
chauffeur
ashwater
park
stryker
by
way
of
hampstead
and
hurry
she
heard
him
say
which
was
surprising
since
the
nearer
way
lay
through
harlenden
and
the
orders
to
hurry
too
save
in
the
stress
of
need
were
under
the
circumstances
hardly
flattering
to
her
but
she
remembered
the
urgent
look
in
his
eyes
in
the
hall
when
he
had
silenced
her
questions
and
sank
back
in
the
seat
her
gaze
fixed
on
the
gloom
of
hyde
park
to
their
left
waiting
for
him
to
speak
he
sat
rigidly
beside
her
his
hands
clasped
about
his
stick
his
eyes
peering
straight
before
him
at
the
back
of
stryker
s
head
she
felt
his
restraint
and
a
little
bitterly
remembered
the
cause
of
it
buoyed
by
a
hope
that
since
he
had
thought
it
fit
to
enact
a
lie
the
whole
tissue
of
doubts
which
assailed
her
might
be
based
on
misconception
also
that
he
was
no
coward
she
knew
more
than
one
instance
of
his
physical
courage
came
back
to
her
incidents
of
his
life
before
fortune
had
thrown
them
together
and
she
only
too
well
remembered
the
time
when
he
had
jumped
from
her
car
and
thrown
himself
in
front
of
a
runaway
horse
saving
the
necks
of
the
occupants
of
the
vehicle
he
had
lied
to
her
but
why
why
she
closed
her
eyes
trying
to
shut
out
the
darkness
and
seek
the
sanctuary
of
some
inner
light
but
she
failed
to
find
it
it
seemed
as
though
the
gloom
which
spread
over
london
had
fallen
over
her
spirit
the
city
of
dreadful
night
she
murmured
at
last
i
can
t
ever
seem
to
get
used
to
she
heard
his
light
laugh
and
the
sound
of
it
comforted
her
jolly
murky
isn
t
it
i
miss
that
fireworks
johnny
pourin
whiskey
over
by
waterloo
bridge
and
big
ben
doesn
t
seem
like
london
all
rot
you
don
t
think
there
s
danger
she
asked
cautiously
he
hesitated
a
moment
before
replying
and
then
no
he
said
not
silence
fell
over
them
again
it
was
as
though
a
shape
sat
between
a
phantom
of
her
dead
hopes
and
his
something
so
cold
and
tangible
that
she
drew
away
in
her
own
corner
and
looked
out
at
the
meaningless
blur
of
the
sleeping
city
her
lips
were
tightly
closed
she
had
given
him
his
chance
to
speak
but
he
had
not
spoken
and
every
foot
of
road
that
they
traversed
seemed
to
carry
them
further
apart
the
end
of
their
journey
was
it
to
be
the
end
of
everything
between
them
after
a
while
that
seemed
interminable
she
heard
his
voice
again
i
suppose
you
think
i
m
an
awful
she
turned
her
head
and
tried
to
read
his
face
but
he
kept
it
away
from
her
toward
the
opposite
window
the
feeling
that
she
had
voiced
to
betty
heathcote
of
wanting
to
mother
him
came
over
her
in
a
warm
effusion
nothing
that
you
can
to
me
will
make
me
think
you
one
cyril
she
said
gently
thanks
awf
ly
he
murmured
and
after
a
pause
i
am
though
you
she
leaned
forward
impulsively
and
laid
a
hand
on
his
knee
no
you
re
acting
strangely
but
i
know
that
there
s
a
reason
for
it
as
for
your
being
a
coward
she
laughed
softly
it
s
impossible
quite
impossible
to
make
me
believe
he
laid
his
fingers
over
hers
for
a
moment
nice
of
you
to
have
confidence
in
a
chap
and
all
that
but
appearances
are
against
me
that
s
the
why
are
they
against
you
why
should
they
be
against
you
because
you
she
stopped
for
here
she
felt
that
she
was
approaching
dangerous
ground
instead
of
parleying
longer
she
used
her
woman
s
weapons
frankly
and
leaning
toward
him
put
an
arm
around
his
neck
and
compelled
him
to
turn
his
face
to
hers
oh
cyril
won
t
you
tell
me
what
this
mystery
is
that
is
coming
between
us
won
t
you
let
me
help
you
i
want
to
be
in
the
sunlight
with
you
again
it
can
t
go
on
this
way
one
of
us
in
the
dark
and
the
other
in
the
light
i
have
felt
it
for
weeks
when
i
spoke
to
you
tonight
about
going
to
france
it
was
in
the
hope
that
you
might
give
me
some
explanation
that
would
satisfy
me
my
heart
is
wrapped
up
in
the
cause
of
england
but
if
the
german
blood
in
you
is
calling
you
away
from
your
duties
as
an
englishman
tell
me
frankly
and
i
will
try
to
forgive
you
but
don
t
let
the
shadow
stay
over
us
any
longer
cyril
i
must
know
the
truth
what
is
the
mystery
that
hangs
over
you
and
makes
mystery
he
put
in
quickly
you
re
a
bit
seedy
doris
thinkin
too
much
about
the
war
nothin
mysterious
about
he
turned
his
head
away
from
her
again
people
don
t
like
my
sittin
tight
here
in
england
he
said
more
slowly
when
all
the
chaps
i
know
are
off
to
the
front
i
i
can
t
help
it
that
s
but
it
s
so
unlike
you
she
pleaded
it
s
the
sporting
thing
i
want
you
to
believe
he
put
in
slowly
it
isn
t
the
kind
of
sport
i
care
i
won
t
believe
it
i
can
t
i
know
you
better
than
that
s
the
trouble
he
insisted
i
m
afraid
you
don
t
know
me
at
i
don
t
know
you
tonight
she
said
sadly
it
almost
seems
as
though
you
were
trying
to
get
rid
of
he
clasped
her
tightly
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
gently
god
forbid
he
muttered
then
tell
me
what
it
is
that
is
worrying
you
she
whispered
not
a
living
soul
shall
ever
know
what
were
the
threats
of
exposure
that
passed
between
you
and
rizzio
he
can
t
bear
you
any
illwill
because
i
chose
you
instead
of
him
i
didn
t
mean
to
listen
but
i
couldn
t
help
it
what
was
the
menace
in
his
tone
to
you
what
is
the
danger
that
hangs
over
you
that
puts
you
in
his
power
it
s
my
right
to
know
tell
me
cyril
tell
she
felt
the
pressure
of
the
arm
around
her
relax
and
the
sudden
rigidity
of
his
whole
body
as
he
drew
away
i
think
you
must
have
been
mistaken
in
what
you
say
you
heard
he
said
evenly
i
told
you
that
it
was
a
personal
matter
a
club
matter
in
which
you
couldn
t
possibly
be
they
were
speaking
formally
now
almost
as
strangers
she
felt
the
indifference
in
his
tone
and
couldn
t
restrain
the
bitterness
that
rose
in
hers
one
gentleman
doesn
t
threaten
a
with
exposure
in
a
club
matter
unless
unless
he
has
done
something
discreditable
something
dishonorable
the
honorable
cyril
bent
his
head
you
have
guessed
he
said
he
he
is
jealous
he
wants
to
humiliate
she
laughed
miserably
then
why
did
you
threaten
him
i
had
to
defend
you
dishonorable
i
ll
have
to
have
proofs
of
that
what
are
the
papers
you
have
that
he
wants
and
what
is
there
incriminating
in
rizzio
s
you
see
i
heard
what
else
did
you
hear
he
asked
quickly
she
drew
away
from
him
and
sank
back
heavily
in
her
corner
nothing
she
muttered
isn
t
that
enough
it
seemed
to
the
girl
as
though
her
companion
s
figure
relaxed
a
little
and
he
turned
toward
her
gently
don
t
bother
about
me
i
m
not
worth
bothering
about
the
worst
of
it
is
that
i
can
t
make
any
explanation
at
least
any
that
will
satisfy
you
all
i
ask
is
that
you
have
patience
with
me
if
you
can
trust
me
if
you
can
and
try
to
forget
try
to
forget
what
you
have
heard
if
you
should
mention
my
conversation
with
rizzio
it
might
lead
to
grave
consequences
for
him
for
the
girl
listened
as
though
in
a
nightmare
the
suspicions
that
had
been
slowly
gathering
in
her
brain
throughout
the
evening
now
focusing
upon
him
from
every
incident
with
a
persistence
that
was
not
to
be
denied
the
shape
sat
between
them
again
more
tangible
more
cold
and
cruel
than
before
all
his
excuses
all
his
explanations
gave
it
substance
and
reality
the
phantom
of
their
dead
hopes
it
had
been
before
now
it
was
something
more
sinister
something
that
put
all
thoughts
of
the
cyril
she
knew
from
her
mind
the
shade
of
judas
fawning
for
his
pieces
of
silver
a
pale
judas
in
a
monocle
she
closed
her
eyes
again
and
tried
to
think
cyril
it
was
unbelievable
and
a
moment
ago
he
had
kissed
her
she
felt
again
the
touch
of
his
lips
on
her
forehead
it
seemed
as
though
she
too
were
being
betrayed
you
ask
something
very
difficult
of
me
she
stammered
chokingly
i
can
only
ask
he
said
and
only
hope
that
you
ll
take
my
word
for
its
she
shivered
in
her
corner
the
sound
of
his
voice
was
so
impersonal
so
different
from
the
easy
bantering
tone
to
which
she
was
accustomed
that
it
seemed
that
what
he
had
said
was
true
that
she
did
not
know
him
another
surprise
awaited
her
for
he
leaned
forward
peering
into
the
mirror
beside
the
wind
shield
in
front
of
stryker
and
turned
and
looked
quickly
out
of
the
rear
window
of
the
car
then
she
heard
his
voice
in
quick
peremptory
notes
through
the
there
s
a
car
behind
us
lose
the
driver
touched
his
cap
and
she
felt
the
machine
leap
forward
the
thin
stream
of
light
far
in
front
of
them
played
on
the
gray
road
and
danced
on
the
dim
faÃ§ades
of
unlighted
houses
which
emerged
from
the
obscurity
slid
by
and
were
lost
again
as
the
car
twisted
and
turned
rocking
from
side
to
side
moving
ever
more
rapidly
toward
the
open
country
to
the
north
the
dark
corners
of
cross
streets
menaced
for
a
moment
and
were
gone
a
reflector
gleamed
from
one
but
they
went
by
it
without
slowing
the
signal
shrieking
a
flash
full
upon
them
a
sound
of
voices
cursing
in
the
darkness
and
the
danger
was
passed
at
the
end
of
a
long
piece
of
straight
road
cyril
turned
again
and
reached
for
the
but
his
voice
was
quite
cool
they
re
coming
on
faster
and
faster
they
went
they
had
reached
the
region
of
villas
and
the
going
was
good
the
road
was
a
narrow
ribbon
of
light
reeling
in
upon
its
spool
with
frightful
rapidity
the
machine
was
a
fine
one
and
its
usual
purr
had
grown
into
a
roar
which
seemed
to
threaten
immediate
disruption
doris
sat
rigidly
clutching
at
the
door
sill
and
seat
trying
to
adjust
her
braced
muscles
to
the
task
of
keeping
upright
but
a
jolt
of
the
car
tore
her
grasp
loose
and
threw
her
into
cyril
s
arms
and
there
he
held
her
steadily
she
was
too
disturbed
to
resist
and
lay
quietly
conscious
of
the
strength
of
the
long
arms
that
enfolded
her
and
aware
in
spite
of
herself
of
a
sense
of
exhilaration
and
triumph
triumph
with
cyril
what
triumph
over
whom
it
didn
t
seem
to
matter
just
then
whom
he
was
trying
to
escape
she
seemed
very
safe
in
his
arms
and
very
contented
though
the
car
rocked
ominously
while
its
headlight
whirled
drunkenly
in
a
wild
orbit
of
tossed
shadows
the
sportswoman
in
her
responded
to
the
call
of
speed
the
chance
of
accident
the
danger
of
capture
for
she
felt
sure
now
that
there
was
a
danger
to
cyril
over
her
shoulder
she
saw
the
lights
of
the
pursuing
machine
glowing
unblinkingly
as
though
endowed
with
a
persistence
which
couldn
t
know
failure
under
the
light
of
an
incandescent
she
saw
that
its
lines
were
those
of
a
and
realized
the
handicap
of
the
heavy
car
with
its
limousine
body
but
stryker
was
doing
his
best
running
with
a
wide
throttle
picking
his
road
with
a
skill
which
would
have
done
credit
to
cyril
himself
the
heath
was
already
behind
them
at
hendon
having
gained
a
little
stryker
put
out
his
lights
and
turned
into
a
hoping
to
slip
away
in
the
darkness
but
as
luck
would
have
it
the
moon
was
bright
and
in
a
moment
they
saw
the
long
spoke
of
light
swing
in
behind
them
good
driver
that
johnny
she
heard
her
companion
say
in
a
note
of
admiration
to
stryker
have
to
run
for
it
the
road
was
not
so
good
here
and
they
lost
time
without
the
searchlights
so
stryker
turned
them
on
again
this
evasion
of
the
straight
issue
of
speed
had
been
a
confession
of
weakness
and
the
other
car
seemed
to
realize
it
for
it
came
on
at
increased
speed
which
shortened
the
distance
so
that
the
figures
of
the
occupants
of
the
other
were
plainly
discernible
five
men
in
all
huddled
low
a
good
piece
of
road
widened
the
distance
the
limousine
now
thoroughly
warmed
was
doing
the
best
that
she
was
capable
of
and
the
tires
cyril
told
her
were
all
new
her
question
seemed
to
give
him
an
idea
for
he
reached
for
the
flower
vase
and
thrusting
out
a
hand
jerked
it
back
into
the
road
a
torn
tire
might
help
a
little
he
said
but
the
fellow
behind
swerved
and
came
faster
it
was
now
a
test
of
metal
their
pursuer
lagged
a
little
on
the
levels
but
caught
them
on
the
grades
and
barring
an
accident
it
was
doubtful
whether
they
would
reach
the
gates
of
ashwater
park
safely
she
heard
a
reflection
of
this
in
cyril
s
voice
as
he
shouted
through
the
open
front
window
how
far
by
the
road
stryker
five
miles
i
d
say
give
her
all
she
can
stryker
nodded
and
from
a
hill
crest
they
seemed
to
soar
into
space
the
car
shivered
and
groaned
like
a
stricken
thing
but
kept
on
down
the
hill
without
the
touch
of
a
brake
they
crossed
a
bridge
rattled
from
side
to
side
cyril
steadied
the
girl
in
his
arms
and
held
her
tight
are
you
frightened
he
asked
her
no
but
what
is
it
all
about
her
companion
glanced
back
to
where
the
long
beams
of
light
were
searching
their
dust
when
he
turned
toward
her
his
face
was
grave
he
held
her
closely
for
a
moment
peering
into
her
eyes
will
you
help
me
doris
she
heard
him
say
but
how
what
can
i
do
cyril
he
hesitated
again
glancing
over
his
shoulder
bally
nuisance
to
have
to
drive
you
like
this
wouldn
t
do
it
if
it
wasn
t
most
important
yes

laugh
when
i
tell
you

amusin
cigarette
papers
cigarette
that

all
i
give
you
my
word
here
they
and
reaching
down
into
his
trousers
pocket
he
produced
a
little
yellow
packet
cigarette
papers
that
s
all
these
chaps
must
be
perishin
for
a
smoke
what
he
laughed
but
i
don
t
it
isn
t
necessary
that
you
should
take
my
word
for
it
won
t
you
it
s
what
they
want
and
i
m
jolly
determined
they
re
not
goin
to
get
you
want
me
to
help
you
how
he
looked
back
again
and
the
lights
behind
them
found
a
reflection
in
his
eyes
if
earlier
in
the
evening
she
had
hoped
to
see
him
fully
awake
she
had
her
wish
now
he
was
quite
cool
and
ready
to
take
an
amused
view
of
things
but
in
his
coolness
she
felt
a
new
power
an
inventiveness
a
readiness
to
resort
to
extremes
to
baffle
his
pursuers
her
apprehension
had
grown
with
the
moments
who
were
these
men
in
the
special
agents
of
scotland
yard
she
had
never
been
so
doubtful
nor
so
proud
of
him
weighed
in
the
balance
of
emotion
the
woman
in
her
decided
it
she
caught
at
his
hand
impulsively
yes
i
ll
help
if
i
can
whatever
he
raised
her
fingers
to
his
lips
and
kissed
them
gently
thank
god
he
muttered
i
knew
you
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
and
then
peered
out
in
search
of
familiar
they
had
passed
canons
hill
and
swung
into
the
main
road
to
watford
if
they
reached
there
safely
they
would
get
to
ashwater
park
which
was
but
a
short
distance
beyond
she
heard
him
speaking
again
and
felt
something
thrust
into
the
palm
of
her
hand
take
this
he
said
it
s
what
they
want
they
mustn
t
get
but
who
are
i
don
t
know
except
that
they
ve
been
sent
by
rizzio
yes
he
s
not
with
them
this
sort
of
game
requires
chaps
of
a
different
you
mean
that
they
oh
don
t
be
alarmed
they
won
t
hurt
me
and
of
course
they
won
t
hurt
you
i
m
going
to
get
you
out
of
the
way
with
this
my
success
depends
on
you
we
ll
drive
past
the
park
entrance
close
to
wicket
gate
in
the
hedge
near
the
house
just
as
we
stop
jump
out
run
through
and
hide
among
the
shrubbery
your
cloak
is
dark
they
won
t
see
you
when
they
re
gone
make
your
way
to
the
house
it
s
a
chance
but
i
ve
got
to
take
and
you
she
faltered
i
ll
get
away
don
t
worry
but
the
packet
whatever
happens
don
t
let
them
get
the
no
she
said
in
a
daze
i
won
keep
it
for
me
until
i
come
but
don
t
examine
it
it
s
quite
unimportant
to
anybody
but
me
he
laughed
that
is
anybody
but
she
stared
straight
in
front
of
her
trying
to
think
but
thought
seemed
impossible
the
speed
had
got
into
her
blood
and
she
was
mastered
by
a
spirit
stronger
than
her
own
he
held
her
in
his
arms
again
and
she
gloried
in
the
thought
that
she
could
help
him
whatever
his
cause
her
heart
and
soul
were
in
it
they
roared
into
watford
and
turning
sharp
to
the
left
took
the
road
to
croxley
green
the
machine
hadn
t
missed
a
spark
but
the
was
creeping
up
was
so
close
that
its
lights
were
blinding
them
hammersley
leaned
forward
and
gave
a
hurried
order
to
stryker
they
passed
the
park
gates
at
full
speed
the
wicket
gate
was
a
quarter
of
a
mile
beyond
would
they
make
it
the
was
roaring
up
alongside
but
stryker
jockeyed
it
into
the
gutter
voices
were
shouting
and
doris
got
the
gleam
of
something
in
the
hand
of
a
tall
figure
standing
up
in
the
other
car
there
followed
shots
four
of
them
and
an
ominous
sound
came
from
somewhere
underneath
as
the
limousine
limped
forward
it
s
our
right
rear
tire
said
stryker
have
we
a
spare
wheel
she
heard
cyril
say
yes
when
we
stop
put
it
on
as
quick
as
you
can
a
hundred
yards
easy
so
and
we
re
there
stryker
now
over
to
the
left
and
give
em
the
road
quick
now
stop
the
other
machine
came
alongside
at
their
right
and
the
men
jumped
down
just
as
cyril
threw
open
the
door
and
doris
leaped
out
and
went
through
the
gate
in
the
hedge
chapter
iv
dangerous
secrets
once
within
the
borders
of
her
father
s
estate
and
hidden
in
a
clump
of
bushes
near
the
hedge
all
idea
of
flight
left
doris
s
head
she
was
home
and
the
familiar
scene
gave
her
confidence
from
the
middle
of
her
clump
of
bushes
grew
a
spruce
tree
and
into
it
she
quickly
climbed
until
she
reached
a
point
where
she
could
see
the
figures
in
the
road
beside
the
quivering
machines
she
had
not
been
followed
the
five
men
were
gathered
around
cyril
who
was
protesting
violently
at
the
outrage
they
had
not
missed
her
yet
stryker
was
on
his
knees
beside
the
stricken
wheel
come
now
she
heard
the
leader
saying
you
re
not
to
be
hurt
if
you
ll
give
em
why
old
chap

re
mad
cyril
was
saying

of

said
the
tall
man
gruffly
off
with
his
coat
jim
now
search
cyril
made
no
resistance
doris
could
see
his
face
quite
plainly
he
was
smiling
rum

he
said
with
a
puzzled
air
i
only
smoke

cigarettes

but
they
searched
him
thoroughly
even
taking
off
his
shoes
i
say

she
heard
him
laugh
you

ticklin
shut
up
d
n

said
the
tall
man
with
a
scowl
said
cyril
cheerfully
but
you
re
wastin
they
found
that
out
in
a
while
and
the
leader
of
the
men
straightened
suddenly
he
gave
a
sound
of
triumph
the
girl
he
cried
and
rushing
to
the
limousine
threw
open
the
door
gone
he
shouted
excitedly
she
can
t
be
far
find
he
rushed
around
the
rear
wheels
of
the
limousine
and
for
the
first
time
spied
the
gate
in
the
hedge
tricked
by
god
in
after
her
some
of
it
won
t
do
a
bit
of
good
remarked
cyril
he
was
sitting
in
the
dirt
of
the
middle
of
the
road
near
the
front
wheels
of
the
machines
she
doesn
t
smoke
o
chap
bad
taste
i
call

gettin
a
lady
mixed
up
in
a
hunt
for
cigarettes
besides
she
s
almost
home
by
this
the
house
isn
t
far
she
lives
there
you
in
her
tree
doris
trembled
she
was
well
screened
by
the
branches
and
she
heard
the
crackle
of
footsteps
in
the
dry
leaves
as
the
searchers
beat
the
bushes
below
her
but
they
passed
on
following
the
path
toward
the
house
as
the
sounds
diminished
in
the
distance
she
saw
cyril
still
seated
on
the
ground
leaning
against
the
front
wheels
of
the
while
he
argued
and
cajoled
the
men
nearest
him
helping
himself
by
a
wheel
as
he
arose
he
faced
the
tall
man
who
had
come
up
waving
his
revolver
and
uttering
wild
threats
it
won
t
help
matters
calling
me
a
lot
of
names
said
cyril
brushing
the
dust
from
his
clothes
you
want
something
i
haven
t
got
that
s
flat
i
hope
you
re
not
yet
they
ll
bring
the
girl
in
a
minute
she
can
t
have
gone
cyril
glanced
around
him
carelessly
and
brushed
his
clothes
again
he
had
discovered
that
stryker
had
put
on
the
spare
wheel
and
was
parleying
with
one
of
their
captors
oh
very
well
have
your
way
what
more
can
i
do
for
you
if
you
don
t
mind
i
d
like
to
be
going
you
ll
wait
for
the
girl
doris
watched
stryker
skulking
along
in
the
shadow
of
the
limousine
she
saw
him
reach
his
seat
heard
a
grinding
of
the
clutches
and
a
confused
scuffle
out
of
which
his
blond
hair
disheveled
his
shoulders
coatless
cyril
emerged
and
leaped
for
the
of
the
moving
machine
you
forgot
to
search
the
limousine
she
heard
him
shout
the
tall
man
scrambled
to
his
knees
and
fired
at
the
retreating
machine
while
the
others
jumped
for
the
it
had
no
sooner
begun
to
move
than
there
was
a
sound
of
escaping
air
and
an
oath
from
the
chauffeur
a
puncture
someone
said
and
doris
heard
a
volley
of
curses
which
spoke
eloquently
of
the
sharpness
of
cyril
s
doris
in
her
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
cyril
had
gotten
safely
off
and
his
last
words
had
created
a
diversion
in
the
camp
of
the
enemy
they
were
working
furiously
at
the
tire
but
she
knew
that
the
chance
of
coming
up
with
cyril
again
that
night
was
gone
now
that
the
affair
had
resulted
so
favorably
to
cyril
she
began
to
regret
her
imprudence
in
remaining
to
see
the
adventure
to
its
end
cyril
had
played
for
time
and
if
she
had
followed
his
instructions
she
could
have
gotten
far
enough
away
to
have
eluded
her
pursuers
by
this
time
in
all
probability
she
would
have
been
safe
beneath
the
parental
roof
the
worst
of
it
was
that
cyril
thought
her
safe
the
packet
in
her
glove
burned
in
her
hand
beneath
her
somewhere
between
her
refuge
and
the
house
were
two
men
and
how
to
pass
them
with
her
precious
possession
became
now
the
sole
object
of
her
thoughts
cyril
had
told
her
that
the
packet
must
under
no
circumstances
fall
into
the
hands
of
their
pursuers
and
the
desperateness
of
his
efforts
to
elude
them
gave
her
a
renewed
sense
of
her
importance
as
an
instrument
for
good
or
ill
in
cyril
s
cause
whatever
it
might
be
now
that
cyril
had
gone
she
felt
singularly
helpless
and
small
in
the
face
of
such
odds
for
a
moment
she
thought
of
hiding
the
packet
in
the
crotch
of
one
of
the
branches
where
she
might
come
and
reclaim
it
at
her
leisure
and
go
down
and
run
the
chance
of
being
taken
without
it
but
the
unpleasantness
which
might
result
from
such
an
encounter
deterred
her
and
so
she
sat
her
chilly
ankles
depending
awaiting
she
knew
not
what
she
had
almost
reconciled
herself
to
the
thought
of
spending
several
hours
in
this
uncomfortable
position
when
the
tall
man
in
the
road
blew
a
blast
on
a
sporting
whistle
and
soon
the
passing
of
footsteps
through
the
gate
advised
her
that
the
men
inside
the
grounds
had
returned
this
was
her
opportunity
and
without
waiting
to
listen
she
dropped
quietly
down
on
the
side
of
the
tree
away
from
the
gate
and
stealing
furtively
along
in
the
shadow
of
the
hedge
made
her
way
as
quickly
as
possible
in
the
direction
of
the
house
out
of
breath
with
exercise
and
excitement
when
she
reached
a
patch
of
trees
at
the
edge
of
the
lawn
she
stopped
and
looked
behind
her
then
she
blessed
her
luck
in
coming
down
when
she
did
for
she
saw
the
thin
ray
of
a
pocket
light
gleaming
like
a
in
her
place
of
concealment
and
knew
that
the
search
for
her
was
still
on
fear
lent
her
caution
she
skirted
the
edge
of
the
wide
lawn
in
the
shadow
of
the
trees
running
like
a
deer
across
the
moonlit
spaces
always
keeping
the
masses
of
evergreens
between
her
and
the
wicket
gate
until
she
reached
the
flower
garden
where
she
paused
a
moment
to
get
her
breath
a
patch
of
moonlight
lay
between
her
and
the
entrance
and
the
hedge
was
impenetrable
there
was
no
other
way
she
bent
low
and
hurried
forward
trusting
to
the
good
fortune
that
had
so
far
aided
her
halfway
across
the
open
she
heard
a
shout
and
knew
that
she
had
been
seen
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
run
straight
for
the
house
so
catching
her
skirts
up
above
her
knees
and
scorning
the
garden
path
which
would
have
taken
her
a
longer
way
she
made
straight
for
the
terrace
the
main
door
of
which
she
knew
had
been
left
open
for
her
return
across
the
wide
lawn
in
the
bright
moonlight
she
ran
her
heart
throbbing
madly
the
precious
yellow
packet
clutched
tightly
against
her
palm
out
of
the
tail
of
her
eye
she
saw
dark
forms
emerge
from
the
bushes
and
run
diagonally
for
the
terrace
steps
in
the
hope
of
intercepting
her
but
she
was
fast
and
she
blessed
her
tennis
for
the
wind
and
muscle
to
stand
the
strain
she
was
much
nearer
her
goal
than
her
pursuers
but
they
came
rapidly
their
bulk
looming
larger
every
moment
she
saw
the
lights
and
knew
that
servants
were
at
hand
her
father
too
was
in
the
library
for
she
saw
the
glow
of
his
she
had
only
to
shout
for
help
now
and
someone
would
hear
her
she
tried
to
but
not
a
sound
came
from
her
parching
throat
with
a
last
effort
she
raced
up
the
terrace
steps
pushed
open
the
heavy
door
and
shut
and
bolted
it
quickly
behind
her
then
sank
into
the
nearest
piece
of
furniture
in
a
state
of
physical
collapse
doris
mather
did
not
faint
an
act
which
might
readily
have
been
forgiven
her
under
the
circumstances
her
nerves
were
shaken
by
the
violence
of
her
exercise
and
the
narrowness
of
her
escape
and
it
was
some
moments
before
she
could
reply
to
the
anxious
questions
that
were
put
to
her
then
she
answered
evasively
peering
through
the
windows
at
the
moonlit
lawn
and
seeing
no
sign
of
her
pursuers
in
a
few
moments
she
drank
a
glass
of
water
and
took
the
arm
of
wilson
her
maid
up
the
stairway
to
her
rooms
after
giving
orders
to
the
servants
that
her
father
was
not
to
be
told
anything
except
that
she
had
come
in
very
tired
and
had
gone
directly
to
bed
for
the
present
at
least
cyril
s
packet
was
safe
in
her
wilson
took
off
her
cloak
and
helped
her
into
bedroom
slippers
not
however
without
a
comment
on
the
bedraggled
state
of
her
dinner
dress
and
the
shocking
condition
of
her
slippers
but
doris
explained
with
some
care
that
hammersley
s
machine
had
had
a
near
the
wicket
gate
that
she
had
become
frightened
and
had
run
all
the
way
across
the
lawn
all
of
which
was
true
it
didn
t
explain
hammersley
s
deficiencies
as
an
escort
but
wilson
was
too
well
trained
to
presume
further
a
little
sherry
and
a
biscuit
and
doris
revived
rapidly
while
the
maid
drew
her
bath
she
locked
cyril
s
cigarette
papers
in
the
drawer
of
the
desk
in
her
bedroom
and
when
she
was
bathed
and
ready
for
the
night
she
dismissed
wilson
to
her
to
wait
within
call
until
she
had
gone
to
bed
alone
with
her
thoughts
her
first
act
was
to
turn
out
her
lights
and
kneel
in
the
window
where
she
could
peer
out
through
the
hangings
it
was
inconceivable
that
her
pursuers
would
dare
to
make
any
attempt
upon
the
house
but
even
now
she
wondered
whether
it
would
not
have
been
wiser
if
she
had
taken
her
father
into
her
confidence
and
had
the
gardeners
out
to
keep
an
eye
open
for
suspicious
characters
but
the
motives
that
had
kept
her
silent
downstairs
in
the
hall
were
even
stronger
with
her
now
she
could
not
have
borne
to
discuss
with
her
father
who
had
an
extraordinary
talent
for
getting
at
the
root
of
difficulties
the
subject
of
cyril
s
questionable
packet
of
cigarette
papers
she
was
quite
sure
from
the
adventure
which
had
befallen
them
tonight
and
the
mystery
with
which
cyril
had
chosen
to
invest
the
article
committed
to
her
care
that
cyril
himself
would
not
have
approved
of
any
course
which
would
have
brought
the
packet
or
his
own
actions
into
the
light
of
publicity
the
packet
of
cigarette
papers
with
a
last
scrutiny
of
the
landscape
she
pulled
the
shades
and
hangings
so
that
no
ray
of
light
could
reach
the
outside
of
the
house
then
groped
her
way
across
the
room
a
thin
line
of
light
beneath
the
door
of
her
showed
that
wilson
was
still
there
so
she
took
the
precaution
of
locking
that
door
as
well
as
the
others
leading
to
the
upstairs
hall
then
went
to
her
desk
and
turned
on
her
lamp
she
unlocked
the
drawer
of
the
desk
and
taking
the
small
object
gingerly
in
her
fingers
scrutinized
it
carefully
it
was
yellow
in
color
quite
new
bound
with
a
small
rubber
band
a
very
prosaic
a
very
harmless
looking
object
to
have
caused
so
much
excitement
and
trouble
to
all
who
had
been
concerned
about
it
she
turned
it
over
and
stretched
its
rubber
band
snapping
it
thoughtfully
two
or
three
times
now
for
the
first
time
since
cyril
had
given
it
to
her
did
she
permit
herself
to
think
of
the
hidden
meanings
the
thing
might
possess
in
the
machine
during
the
chase
cyril
had
won
her
unreservedly
to
his
side
as
against
the
mysterious
men
of
john
rizzio
cyril
s
cause
had
been
the
only
one
to
be
considered
she
had
been
carried
off
her
feet
and
there
hadn
t
been
time
to
think
of
anything
but
the
real
necessity
of
acceding
to
cyril
s
wishes
in
getting
the
small
object
to
a
place
of
safety
then
it
had
only
been
a
packet
of
cigarette
papers
a
mere
package
of
which
everybody
for
some
reason
or
other
seemed
to
want
now
weighed
lightly
in
her
hand
the
seclusion
of
her
room
gave
it
a
different
character
she
recalled
cyril
s
bantering
tone
at
having
been
chased
twenty
miles
for
a
cigarette
but
his
attitude
deceived
doris
no
more
than
it
had
his
pursuers
there
was
material
here
for
something
more
deadly
than
cigarettes
she
took
the
yellow
packet
in
both
hands
and
pressed
it
to
her
temples
as
though
by
this
act
she
could
pass
its
secrets
into
her
own
brain
in
spite
of
herself
she
was
frightfully
curious
and
frightfully
afraid
she
got
up
and
paced
the
floor
rapidly
no
it
couldn
t
go
on
she
must
know
the
truth
as
the
key
of
the
one
unopened
room
fascinated
blue
beard
s
wife
as
the
box
fascinated
pandora
so
this
unopened
yellow
packet
plagued
and
fascinated
doris
mather
she
hesitated
another
long
moment
and
then
slipped
off
the
rubber
band
and
opened
it
trembling
so
that
the
first
leaf
of
paper
came
out
in
her
fingers
and
fell
to
the
floor
she
picked
the
paper
up
and
examined
it
minutely
holding
it
up
to
the
light
there
was
nothing
unusual
about
it
no
mark
no
sign
of
any
kind
that
might
indicate
a
secret
mission
leaf
by
leaf
slowly
at
first
and
then
more
rapidly
she
went
through
the
leaves
examining
each
page
back
and
front
without
success
it
was
not
until
she
was
almost
half
through
it
that
she
came
upon
the
writing
four
pages
written
lengthways
in
ink
with
a
line
too
fine
almost
for
legibility
she
put
the
packet
down
for
a
moment
her
heart
throbbing
with
excitement
and
incredulity
too
apprehensive
to
read
in
mortal
dread
of
a
revelation
which
was
to
change
the
whole
course
of
her
life
and
cyril
s
there
was
still
time
to
close
the
book
and
go
to
bed
why
did
she
sit
there
holding
the
thing
open
stupidly
gazing
at
nothing
if
cyril
yes
if
cyril
was
the
unspeakable
thing
of
her
doubts
it
was
time
that
she
knew
it
and
no
compunctions
of
honor
should
hold
her
with
such
a
man
besides
she
had
promised
him
nothing
hesitating
no
longer
she
held
the
leaves
under
the
light
of
her
lamp
and
slowly
deciphered
the
thin
script
at
first
she
could
make
little
of
it
as
it
seemed
to
consist
of
numerals
which
she
couldn
t
understand
but
here
and
there
she
made
out
the
names
of
towns
the
names
of
regiments
familiar
to
her
and
a
series
of
dates
beginning
in
march
and
ending
in
may
as
the
meaning
of
the
writing
grew
clearer
to
her
she
read
on
her
eyes
distended
with
horror
even
a
child
could
have
seen
that
this
was
a
list
of
the
british
forces
under
arms
the
proposed
dates
for
the
completion
of
their
equipment
training
and
departure
for
france
when
she
had
finished
reading
the
written
pages
her
inert
fingers
slowly
turned
the
blank
papers
over
to
the
end
there
was
nothing
more
god
knows
it
was
enough
cyril
the
honorable
cyril
a
spy
of
the
germans
she
sank
low
in
her
armchair
her
senses
numb
from
the
horror
of
the
revelation
her
thoughts
became
confused
like
those
of
a
sick
person
awaking
from
a
nightmare
to
a
half
consciousness
peopled
with
strange
beautiful
images
doing
the
dark
things
of
dreams
cyril
cyril
a
spy
what
would
happen
now
and
which
way
did
duty
lie
toward
england
or
toward
cyril
she
sat
crouched
on
the
floor
in
an
agony
of
misery
at
the
thought
of
cyril
s
baseness
the
package
of
paper
clenched
in
her
hand
trying
to
think
clearly
for
england
for
cyril
for
herself
but
the
longer
she
battled
the
deeper
became
her
desperation
and
despair
the
world
seemed
to
be
slipping
away
from
her
the
orderly
arrangement
of
her
thoughts
was
twisted
and
distorted
so
that
wrong
had
become
right
and
right
wrong
she
had
lost
her
standard
of
judgment
she
did
not
know
which
way
to
turn
so
she
bent
her
head
forward
into
her
hands
and
silently
prayed
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
else
to
do
for
a
long
while
she
remained
prostrate
by
the
window
her
brain
tortured
her
body
stiff
with
weariness
until
she
could
think
no
more
then
slowly
and
painfully
she
rose
and
still
clutching
the
yellow
packet
groped
her
way
to
bed
into
which
she
fell
exhausted
in
mind
and
body
chapter
v
the
pursuit
continues
at
eight
o
clock
doris
was
awakened
by
a
loud
knocking
on
the
door
leading
to
her
she
had
slept
the
sleep
of
utter
exhaustion
and
aroused
herself
with
difficulty
a
little
bewildered
at
the
unusual
sounds
then
she
dimly
remembered
locking
the
door
and
got
quickly
out
of
bed
put
the
yellow
packet
in
the
drawer
of
her
desk
and
pushed
back
the
bolt
of
the
door
to
her
surprise
her
father
confronted
her
and
behind
him
were
other
members
of
the
family
in
various
stages
of
their
morning
toilets
thank
the
lord
said
david
mather
with
a
sigh
of
relief
what
on
earth
is
the
matter
asked
the
girl
glancing
from
one
to
the
other
in
alarm
her
father
laughed
oh
nothing
now
that
you
re
all
right
burglars
that
s
doris
s
heart
stopped
beating
as
in
a
flash
of
reviving
memory
the
incidents
of
the
night
before
came
quickly
back
to
her
burglars
she
stammered
yes
they
got
in
here
came
up
the
water
spout
pointing
to
the
window
and
a
fine
mess
they
made
of
things
you
ll
have
to
take
account
of
stock
child
and
see
how
you
she
glanced
around
the
disordered
room
very
much
alarmed
the
drawers
of
her
cupboards
were
all
pulled
out
and
their
contents
scattered
about
on
the
floor
when
did
did
it
happen
she
asked
timorously
more
because
she
had
to
say
something
than
because
that
was
what
she
wanted
to
know
some
time
before
dawn
said
her
father
wilson
was
here
until
three
thinking
that
you
might
want
her
and
then
went
out
to
her
own
room
in
the
yes
i
remember
said
the
girl
passing
her
hand
across
her
eyes
i
wasn
t
feeling
very
well
so
i
asked
her
to
stay
here
for
a
while
but
i
can
t
understand
why
i
didn
t
that
s
what
frightened
us
cousin
tom
broke
in
we
were
afraid
the
snoozers
might
have
got
in
to
you
it
s
lucky
you
had
your
door
they
were
at
my
library
desk
too
she
heard
her
father
saying
must
have
gone
down
the
hall
from
here
but
so
far
as
i
can
see
they
didn
t
get
her
aunt
sophia
gasped
a
sigh
thank
the
lord
she
put
in
reverently
at
least
we
re
all
safe
and
stunned
at
the
daring
of
rizzio
s
men
and
bewildered
by
the
persistence
with
which
they
had
followed
their
quest
while
she
was
sleeping
doris
managed
to
formulate
a
quick
plan
to
hide
the
meaning
of
this
intrusion
from
the
members
of
her
family
she
had
been
examining
the
disordered
contents
of
the
upper
drawers
of
a
bureau
my
jewel
case
fortunately
i
keep
in
my
bedroom
she
said
but
there
was
an
emerald
brooch
to
be
repaired
which
i
put
in
this
drawer
yesterday
it
s
she
saw
a
puzzled
look
come
into
the
eyes
of
wilson
who
stood
near
the
window
and
a
glance
passed
between
them
oh
well
her
father
said
as
he
turned
toward
the
door
we
re
lucky
it
wasn
t
worse
i
m
phoning
to
watford
for
a
this
was
what
doris
had
feared
and
yet
she
could
not
protest
so
she
shut
her
lips
firmly
and
let
them
go
out
of
the
room
leaving
her
alone
with
wilson
she
knew
that
the
woman
was
devoted
to
her
and
that
she
was
not
in
the
habit
of
talking
belowstairs
but
her
mistress
had
seen
the
look
of
incredulity
in
the
woman
s
eyes
last
night
and
the
puzzled
expression
a
moment
ago
which
indicated
a
suspicion
connecting
doris
s
arrival
in
the
hall
with
the
mysterious
entrance
of
the
doris
knew
that
she
must
tell
her
something
that
would
satisfy
her
curiosity
my
bath
please
wilson
she
said
coolly
in
order
to
gain
time
and
say
nothing
you
of
course
miss
mather
said
wilson
with
her
broad
kentish
smile
i
wouldn
t
ha
dreamed
of
the
cool
water
refreshed
and
invigorated
the
girl
and
she
planned
skillfully
by
the
time
wilson
brought
her
breakfast
tray
she
had
already
wrapped
the
yellow
packet
of
cigarette
papers
and
her
cousin
tom
s
tobacco
pouch
in
a
pair
of
silk
stockings
surrounded
by
many
thicknesses
of
paper
and
in
a
disguised
handwriting
had
addressed
it
to
lady
heathcote
at
her
place
in
scotland
she
had
also
written
a
note
to
betty
advising
her
of
a
change
in
plans
and
of
her
intention
to
come
to
her
upon
the
following
day
asking
in
a
postscript
twice
underlined
to
keep
a
certain
package
addressed
to
her
and
carefully
described
safely
under
lock
and
key
for
her
without
opening
until
her
arrival
she
would
explain
later
a
gleam
of
hope
had
penetrated
to
her
through
the
gloom
that
encompassed
her
thoughts
only
a
gleam
at
the
best
but
it
was
enough
to
give
her
courage
to
go
on
with
her
efforts
to
save
cyril
from
immediate
danger
and
this
was
the
belief
born
of
the
forcible
and
secret
entry
of
the
house
that
the
men
who
were
in
pursuit
of
the
fateful
packet
were
not
in
any
way
connected
with
scotland
yard
or
the
war
office
otherwise
if
they
believed
the
papers
to
be
in
her
possession
they
would
have
come
boldly
in
the
light
of
day
and
demanded
of
her
father
the
right
to
search
the
house
these
were
not
times
when
the
war
office
hesitated
in
matters
which
concerned
the
public
interest
john
rizzio
for
some
reason
which
she
could
not
fathom
was
acting
upon
his
own
initiative
with
a
desire
as
urgent
as
cyril
s
to
keep
his
object
secret
she
pondered
those
things
for
a
long
while
and
then
with
a
sigh
of
uncertainty
dismissed
them
from
her
thoughts
which
were
too
full
of
the
immediate
necessity
to
carry
out
her
carefully
formulated
plans
first
she
called
wilson
and
after
assuring
herself
that
she
was
making
no
mistake
took
her
partially
into
confidence
telling
her
of
the
important
paper
intrusted
by
hammersley
to
her
care
which
it
was
to
the
interest
of
other
persons
to
possess
and
the
necessity
for
getting
them
safely
out
of
the
house
her
mistress
s
confidences
flattered
the
maid
and
she
entered
very
willingly
into
the
affair
concealing
the
emerald
brooch
which
doris
produced
from
her
jewel
box
in
a
trunk
containing
old
clothes
which
had
long
stood
neglected
in
a
dusty
corner
of
the
attic
after
the
visit
of
the
man
from
watford
who
went
over
the
situation
with
a
puzzled
brow
and
departed
still
puzzled
she
confided
to
her
father
the
letter
and
package
which
were
to
be
mailed
from
london
the
letter
in
the
morning
the
package
not
until
night
don
t
fail
me
daddy
it
s
important
she
said
as
she
kissed
him
it
s
a
surprise
for
betty
but
it
mustn
t
get
to
scotland
until
tomorrow
night
at
the
earliest
and
and
she
kissed
him
again
i
m
going
with
tonight
mather
smiled
and
pinched
her
cheeks
he
was
quite
accustomed
to
sudden
changes
of
plan
on
the
part
of
his
daughter
and
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
questioning
them
as
he
would
the
changes
in
the
weather
he
hadn
t
liked
the
idea
of
her
hunting
or
playing
polo
but
she
had
done
them
both
and
cajoled
him
into
approving
of
her
he
had
objected
fearfully
when
she
went
in
for
aviation
but
had
learned
to
watch
the
flights
of
her
little
nieuport
with
growing
confidence
and
had
even
erected
a
shed
for
her
machines
in
the
meadow
behind
the
stables
take
care
of
yourself
he
said
lightly
you
re
looking
a
little
peaky
lately
if
you
don
t
get
rosier
i
ll
withdraw
my
ambulance
she
laughed
don
t
forget
she
flung
after
him
as
he
got
into
the
car
with
the
departure
of
the
yellow
packet
a
weight
had
been
lifted
from
doris
s
mind
john
rizzio
s
men
might
come
now
if
they
liked
and
she
would
invite
them
to
search
the
place
she
was
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
herself
and
she
knew
that
the
danger
to
cyril
had
passed
at
least
for
the
present
she
hoped
that
cyril
wouldn
t
come
today
or
telephone
her
she
wanted
time
to
think
of
what
she
should
say
to
him
at
moments
it
even
seemed
as
though
she
didn
t
care
if
she
ever
saw
him
again
but
as
the
day
passed
and
she
had
no
word
from
him
she
grew
anxious
what
if
rizzio
had
told
the
war
office
that
night
men
from
watford
kept
a
watch
upon
the
house
but
there
was
no
disturbance
her
watchers
had
evidently
taken
the
alarm
but
it
was
in
no
very
certain
or
very
happy
state
that
doris
drove
her
machine
out
of
the
gate
of
the
park
in
the
later
afternoon
of
the
next
day
with
her
cousin
tom
beside
her
and
wilson
and
the
luggage
in
the
rear
seat
the
main
road
to
london
was
empty
of
vehicles
except
for
a
man
on
a
just
ahead
of
her
bound
in
the
same
direction
at
least
she
was
no
longer
to
be
watched
there
was
plenty
of
time
so
she
drove
leisurely
reaching
euston
station
with
twenty
minutes
to
spare
she
sent
a
wire
to
lady
heathcote
and
then
tom
saw
her
safely
into
her
carriage
the
movement
of
the
train
soothed
her
and
she
closed
her
eyes
and
slept
wilson
like
a
watchful
gorgon
guarding
against
intrusion
there
was
but
one
incident
which
destroyed
the
peace
of
the
journey
toward
morning
wilson
who
slept
with
one
eye
open
wakened
her
suddenly
and
asked
her
quietly
to
look
out
of
the
window
her
train
had
stopped
at
a
large
station
the
platform
of
which
was
well
lighted
from
the
darkness
of
their
compartment
she
followed
the
direction
of
wilson
s
figure
outside
pacing
the
platform
and
smoking
cigarettes
were
two
men
what
is
it
asked
doris
half
asleep
the
big
one
whispered
wilson
excitedly
it
was
him
that
was
ridin
the
doris
remembered
passing
and
repassing
the
vehicle
on
the
road
to
london
and
the
face
of
its
driver
came
back
to
her
she
peered
out
at
him
eagerly
and
as
the
man
turned
she
saw
the
face
and
figure
of
the
larger
man
clearly
it
was
the
man
and
in
a
rush
the
thought
came
to
her
that
his
figure
and
bearing
were
strangely
familiar
it
s
true
she
whispered
her
fingers
on
wilson
s
arm
we
re
followed
it
s
the
same
man
last
night
last
night
yes
it
s
the
man
called
jim
who
searched
hammersley
in
the
no
said
wilson
her
eyes
brightening
you
don
t
say
so
miss
mather
of
all
the
brazen
sh
said
doris
but
there
was
no
more
sleep
for
either
of
them
that
night
bolt
upright
side
by
side
they
watched
the
dawn
grow
into
sunrise
and
the
sunrise
into
broad
day
they
saw
no
more
of
the
man
and
doris
reassured
herself
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
feared
now
that
the
packet
was
she
started
in
affright
the
packet
at
betty
heathcote
s
perhaps
at
this
very
moment
lying
innocently
in
betty
s
or
in
the
careless
hands
of
some
stupid
scotch
gardener
or
worse
yet
inviting
curiosity
on
betty
s
desk
or
library
table
her
heart
sank
within
her
as
she
realized
that
her
brave
plans
might
yet
miscarry
it
was
with
a
sense
of
joyous
relief
that
the
train
pulled
at
last
into
innerwick
station
when
she
got
down
she
saw
betty
heathcote
s
yellow
brake
the
four
chestnuts
restive
in
the
keen
moorland
air
and
looking
very
youthful
and
handsome
in
a
brown
coat
which
made
the
symphony
complete
the
lady
herself
the
wind
in
her
cheeks
and
in
her
cheery
greeting
of
course
doris
you
re
to
be
trusted
to
do
something
surprising
oh
here
s
jack
sandys
you
didn
t
know
of
the
sight
of
these
familiar
faces
gave
doris
renewed
confidence
and
when
from
the
box
seat
she
glanced
around
in
search
of
her
pursuer
he
had
disappeared
sandys
clambered
up
behind
them
wilson
got
into
the
back
seat
with
the
grooms
the
boxes
went
in
between
and
they
were
off
constance
was
tired
jack
at
least
she
said
she
was
i
really
think
that
all
she
wanted
was
to
disappoint
you
nothing
like
disappointment
it
breeds
aspiration
but
she
added
mischievously
i
m
sure
she
s
to
see
you
awf
ly
sad
especially
since
it
s
not
quite
hours
since
you
were
waving
a
tearful
in
euston
did
you
get
my
package
whispered
doris
in
her
ear
at
the
first
opportunity
what
package
oh
yes
the
stockings
it
was
torn
and
awf
ly
muddy
higgins
dropped
it
from
the
on
the
way
over
and
had
to
go
back
for
it
lucky
he
found
it
in
the
middle
of
the
road
what
a
silly
thing
to
make
such
a
mystery
of
and
the
cigarette
papers
you
might
be
sure
i
d
have
something
to
smoke
at
kilmorack
house
i
can
t
understand
you
really
smoke
here
if
you
want
to
without
so
much
secrecy
about
i
i
didn
t
know
stammered
the
girl
i
i
ve
just
taken
it
up
and
i
thought
you
mightn
t
betty
glanced
at
her
narrowly
whatever
ails
you
child
disapprove
you
know
i
smoke
when
i
feel
like
it
which
isn
t
the
subject
fortunately
was
turned
when
they
passed
the
road
to
i
always
envied
cyril
his
cliffs
i
love
the
sea
and
cyril
hates
it
so
jolly
restless
she
mimicked
him
makes
one
and
there
i
am
away
inland
five
miles
to
the
firth
at
the
very
nearest
but
i
suppose
she
sighed
one
has
to
overlook
the
deficiencies
of
one
s
grandfather
if
he
had
known
i
d
have
liked
the
sea
cyril
of
course
would
have
come
into
with
this
kind
of
light
chatter
of
which
lady
heathcote
possessed
a
fund
their
whip
drove
them
upon
their
way
her
own
fine
spirits
oblivious
of
the
silence
of
her
companions
but
at
last
she
glanced
at
them
suspiciously
if
i
didn
t
know
that
you
were
both
hopelessly
in
love
with
other
persons
i
d
think
you
were
of
each
doris
laughed
we
are
that
s
why
we
chose
opposite
ends
of
the
but
sandys
only
smiled
nothing
that
s
happening
makes
a
chap
happy
nowadays
i
bring
bad
lady
heathcote
relaxed
the
reins
so
that
one
of
her
leaders
plunged
madly
while
her
face
went
white
not
algy
no
no
forgive
me
he
s
safe
i
ve
kept
watch
of
the
thank
god
said
lady
heathcote
and
sent
her
whiplash
swirling
over
the
ears
of
the
erring
leader
not
algy
byfield
byfield
not
dead
no
what
in
prison
he
was
taken
into
custody
yesterday
afternoon
as
he
was
leaving
the
war
office
orders
from
you
can
t
mean
that
richard
byfield
is
sandys
nodded
quickly
yes
he
was
one
of
the
leaks
a
a
spy
betty
heathcote
whispered
in
awestricken
tones
a
spy
dick
horrible
i
can
t
i
won
t
unfortunately
there
s
not
the
least
doubt
about
it
they
found
incriminating
evidence
at
his
my
god
said
lady
heathcote
what
are
we
coming
to
dick
byfield
why
two
nights
ago
he
was
a
guest
at
my
table
with
you
and
you
doris
nodded
faintly
the
landscape
swimming
in
a
dark
mist
before
her
eyes
byfield
cyril
rizzio
all
three
had
been
at
lady
heathcote
s
dinner
something
had
happened
that
night
only
a
part
of
which
she
knew
byfield
was
arrested
and
cyril
she
clutched
desperately
at
the
edge
of
the
seat
and
set
her
jaw
to
keep
herself
from
speaking
cyril
s
name
were
there
any
others
she
asked
with
an
effort
none
so
far
but
there
must
have
been
others
god
help
them
they
won
t
get
any
but
what
made
him
do
such
a
thing
asked
betty
i
could
have
sworn
money
lots
of
it
he
wasn
t
very
well
off
you
they
were
swinging
over
the
ridge
towards
kilmorack
house
in
a
tragic
silence
mocked
by
the
high
jubilant
notes
of
the
coach
horn
which
the
groom
was
winding
to
announce
their
approach
doris
got
down
swiftly
summoning
her
courage
to
be
silent
and
wait
in
the
when
the
news
was
told
constance
joyliffe
added
another
note
of
gloom
we
re
going
to
be
a
lively
party
said
lady
heathcote
bitterly
thank
the
lord
john
rizzio
is
rizzio
doris
flashed
around
her
terror
written
so
plainly
that
anyone
might
read
yes
i
had
his
wire
at
innerwick
when
i
was
waiting
for
and
then
catching
the
girl
by
the
arm
why
dear
what
is
the
matter
i
i
think
i
ll
go
up
to
my
room
if
you
don
t
mind
betty
i
won
t
have
any
luncheon
a
cup
of
tea
is
she
moved
toward
the
door
her
hand
in
lady
heathcote
s
and
betty
the
package
please
i
i
think
it
may
soothe
me
to
betty
examined
her
quizzically
but
made
no
comment
though
she
couldn
t
understand
such
a
strange
proceeding
in
a
girl
who
was
accustomed
to
do
exactly
as
she
pleased
she
got
the
package
from
her
desk
in
the
library
and
handed
doris
the
silk
stockings
tobacco
and
the
yellow
packet
the
wrapping
paper
which
had
been
soiled
had
been
relegated
to
the
and
betty
pleaded
doris
as
she
quickly
took
them
promise
me
that
you
won
t
tell
john
lady
heathcote
glanced
at
her
quickly
and
then
laughed
i
suppose
i
m
the
least
curious
woman
in
scotland
she
laughed
but
i
would
really
like
to
know
don
t
ask
me
betty
doris
pleaded
i
ve
a
reason
a
silly
one
perhaps
but
i
ask
you
not
to
speak
of
this
to
oh
very
well
said
lady
heathcote
i
won
t
but
don
t
be
mysterious
all
mysteries
nowadays
are
looked
on
with
suspicion
even
such
an
innocent
little
mystery
and
she
laughed
as
a
package
of
cigarette
doris
made
some
light
reply
and
went
to
her
room
where
with
the
doors
locked
she
quickly
examined
the
packet
to
be
sure
that
it
had
not
been
tampered
with
nothing
seemed
to
have
been
changed
and
she
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
to
think
that
thus
far
her
secret
had
escaped
detection
it
was
very
clear
to
her
now
that
john
rizzio
had
decided
that
the
secret
information
was
in
her
possession
and
that
his
visit
was
planned
with
the
object
of
getting
it
away
from
her
this
should
never
be
by
the
light
of
the
window
she
read
and
the
thin
script
until
the
lines
were
etched
upon
her
memory
she
would
burn
the
papers
if
they
were
in
danger
if
cyril
was
to
meet
captain
byfield
s
fate
it
would
be
upon
other
evidence
than
this
her
hands
at
least
with
regard
to
cyril
must
be
clean
a
knock
upon
the
door
and
she
hurriedly
thrust
the
packet
under
a
table
cover
and
answered
it
was
the
maid
with
her
tea
and
upon
the
tray
lay
a
note
in
an
unfamiliar
handwriting
when
the
maid
had
gone
she
tore
the
flap
and
read
hammersley
begs
that
miss
mather
will
not
be
unduly
alarmed
upon
his
account
business
of
an
urgent
nature
has
detained
him
but
he
assures
her
that
he
will
join
her
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
he
begs
that
she
will
be
careful
there
was
no
signature
and
the
handwriting
was
curious
like
none
to
which
she
was
accustomed
but
the
message
seemed
somehow
to
sound
like
cyril
she
rang
for
the
maid
questioned
her
and
found
that
the
note
had
just
come
over
by
messenger
from
when
the
maid
went
down
doris
the
message
thankfully
cyril
was
safe
at
least
for
the
present
and
her
relief
in
the
knowledge
was
the
true
measure
of
her
relation
to
him
whatever
else
he
was
he
was
the
man
she
had
promised
to
marry
the
man
who
a
little
later
would
have
been
hers
for
better
or
for
worse
and
between
cyril
and
john
rizzio
it
had
not
been
difficult
to
choose
it
did
not
seem
difficult
now
she
took
up
the
packet
of
papers
and
paused
before
the
open
fire
a
smile
playing
for
the
first
time
at
the
corners
of
her
lips
john
rizzio
he
was
clever
as
she
knew
but
there
was
more
than
one
way
of
playing
the
game
perhaps
with
her
john
rizzio
might
be
at
a
disadvantage
she
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
pulled
up
her
skirts
and
slipped
the
yellow
packet
into
her
stocking
chapter
vi
rizzio
takes
charge
rizzio
was
to
arrive
that
night
meanwhile
with
the
papers
hidden
about
her
and
bright
fires
burning
in
all
the
of
the
house
in
which
they
could
in
a
moment
be
destroyed
doris
thought
herself
well
placed
upon
the
defensive
cyril
s
note
had
cheered
her
and
after
removing
the
dust
of
her
journey
she
went
down
into
the
library
where
she
joined
the
other
members
of
the
house
party
assembled
black
seemed
to
be
the
prevailing
color
for
in
addition
to
the
weeds
of
lady
constance
there
was
wilfred
hammersley
cyril
s
uncle
who
had
lost
an
only
son
at
la
bassÃ©e
and
the
heatherington
girls
who
had
lost
a
brother
ugh
lady
betty
was
saying
i
came
to
scotland
to
try
and
forget
but
the
war
follows
me
dick
byfield
a
traitor
who
next
let
s
not
even
speak
of
it
come
i
ve
ordered
the
brake
doris
we
re
going
out
for
a
spin
you
and
i
and
angeline
constance
of
course
has
a
headache
and
jack
will
be
having
another
for
the
air
outside
was
and
when
she
returned
later
doris
felt
that
her
brain
had
been
swept
clear
of
its
cobwebs
of
perplexity
she
found
wilson
standing
in
her
room
gazing
with
a
puzzled
expression
at
the
tray
of
her
unpacked
box
the
contents
of
which
were
in
a
state
of
confusion
it
s
strange
miss
mather
someone
has
been
at
your
things
while
i
was
down
in
the
servants
hall
at
you
re
sure
yes
miss
mather
sure
quite
positive
in
fact
those
waists
were
lying
flat
when
i
the
window
wasn
t
open
asked
doris
with
a
glance
around
oh
no
she
looked
about
and
lowered
her
voice
it
s
somebody
curious
said
doris
thoughtfully
nothing
has
been
taken
is
the
jewel
box
there
together
they
examined
the
things
and
found
that
nothing
was
missing
say
nothing
about
this
wilson
said
doris
thoughtfully
unless
something
is
taken
i
shouldn
t
care
to
disturb
lady
it
can
t
be
wilson
paused
her
voice
hushed
the
papers
are
safe
wilson
as
long
as
i
am
safe
replied
the
girl
and
told
the
maid
of
her
place
of
concealment
wilson
looked
dubious
i
wish
you
d
give
them
to
me
miss
but
the
girl
shook
her
head
she
was
thoroughly
alive
now
to
the
perils
which
hung
about
her
here
within
the
very
doors
of
lady
heathcote
s
house
but
she
had
determined
that
if
she
could
not
find
it
possible
to
keep
the
papers
until
cyril
appeared
she
would
destroy
them
she
was
not
frightened
for
however
clumsy
john
rizzio
s
agents
might
be
she
was
in
no
danger
from
himself
whatever
the
interests
which
made
the
possession
of
the
yellow
packet
so
vital
she
knew
the
man
well
enough
to
be
sure
that
if
there
came
an
issue
between
them
he
would
act
with
her
as
he
had
always
acted
the
part
of
a
gentleman
instead
of
apprehension
at
his
approaching
visit
she
now
felt
only
interest
and
a
kind
of
suppressed
exhilaration
as
at
the
prospect
of
a
flight
in
a
new
plane
or
the
trying
out
of
a
green
hunter
excitement
like
that
which
preceded
all
her
sportive
ventures
so
that
when
she
met
john
rizzio
in
the
after
dinner
he
had
not
been
able
to
manage
a
more
opportune
train
she
gave
him
a
warm
of
greeting
and
a
smile
which
caused
him
some
surprise
and
not
a
little
regret
surprise
that
she
was
carrying
off
a
difficult
situation
with
consummate
ease
regret
that
such
and
artistry
were
not
to
be
added
to
the
ornaments
of
his
house
in
berkeley
square
perhaps
still
how
agreeable
she
was
saying
charmingly
the
great
man
actually
condescends
to
come
to
the
land
of
calvin
oatcake
and
sulphur
when
there
are
truffles
and
old
madeira
still
to
be
had
in
he
laughed
his
dark
eyes
appraising
her
slender
blond
beauty
eagerly
i
have
no
quarrel
with
calvin
oatcake
by
all
means
sulphur
er
i
suppose
the
sulphur
will
come
in
not
if
you
re
polite
said
the
girl
coolly
and
tell
me
what
brought
you
so
unexpectedly
to
they
were
standing
near
the
fire
apart
from
the
others
doris
with
one
slipper
on
the
fender
which
she
was
regarding
approvingly
her
head
upon
one
side
he
admired
her
careless
tone
she
was
quite
wonderful
perhaps
you
will
not
believe
me
he
said
suavely
if
i
were
to
tell
you
that
i
came
to
see
me
i
flattered
i
thought
that
great
collectors
were
always
deterred
by
fear
of
the
she
was
carrying
the
war
into
his
camp
he
met
the
issue
squarely
they
are
deterred
by
the
spurious
therefore
i
am
here
the
inference
is
he
had
always
showed
the
slightest
trace
of
his
foreign
accent
it
went
admirably
with
his
shrug
and
mobile
fingers
i
am
genuine
in
this
she
laughed
that
however
much
you
know
about
pictures
about
de
women
must
remain
for
you
and
for
all
other
men
an
unknown
not
when
they
are
both
he
said
gallantly
there
are
good
and
bad
pictures
objects
of
virtue
excessively
ugly
objects
of
virtue
are
usually
excessively
ugly
especially
if
they
are
thanks
said
doris
you
re
most
flattering
there
s
something
in
the
air
of
scotland
that
makes
one
tell
the
he
laughed
if
scotland
is
as
merciless
as
that
i
shall
be
off
in
the
morning
i
could
imagine
no
worse
purgatory
than
a
place
in
which
one
always
tells
the
truth
lying
is
one
of
the
highest
arts
of
a
mature
civilization
i
haven
t
the
slightest
notion
nor
have
you
that
either
of
us
means
a
thing
he
says
we
were
all
born
to
deceive
some
of
us
do
it
in
one
way
some
in
another
but
we
all
do
it
to
the
very
best
of
our
bent
for
instance
you
said
a
while
ago
that
it
was
agreeable
for
you
to
see
me
but
i
m
quite
sure
you
know
that
it
wasn
it
isn
t
agreeable
if
you
re
going
to
be
horrid
and
cynical
why
i
be
glad
to
see
you
you
always
stimulate
my
intelligence
even
if
you
don
t
flatter
the
others
had
moved
on
to
the
library
and
they
had
the
room
to
themselves
i
don
t
see
how
i
could
flatter
it
more
than
i
have
already
done
he
said
in
a
low
tone
of
voice
she
raised
her
chin
a
trifle
and
peered
at
him
slantwise
do
you
think
that
you
flatter
it
now
when
you
recall
the
mistakes
of
my
past
he
searched
her
face
keenly
but
her
blue
eyes
met
his
gaze
steadily
she
was
smiling
up
at
him
guilelessly
a
mistake
of
course
he
said
slowly
you
are
young
enough
to
afford
to
make
mistakes
but
i
am
old
enough
to
wish
that
it
hadn
t
been
made
at
my
you
still
care
she
asked
i
if
i
hadn
t
thought
that
you
wanted
me
for
your
collection
you
are
cruel
no
i
know
you
wanted
me
for
your
portrait
harem
and
i
should
have
been
frightfully
jealous
of
the
coningsby
venus
i
couldn
t
compete
with
that
sort
of
thing
you
he
smiled
at
her
admiringly
and
went
on
in
a
low
tone
you
know
why
i
wanted
you
then
and
why
i
want
you
now
because
you
re
the
cleverest
woman
in
england
and
the
most
it
took
courage
to
refuse
the
hand
of
john
it
takes
more
courage
in
john
rizzio
to
hear
those
words
from
the
lips
that
refused
she
laid
her
hand
gently
on
his
arm
i
am
sorry
she
said
he
bent
his
head
and
kissed
her
fingers
it
is
not
the
coningsby
venus
who
is
essential
to
my
happiness
he
whispered
it
s
the
doris
she
laughed
that
s
the
disillusionment
of
no
the
only
disillusionments
of
life
are
its
failures
i
got
the
venus
by
infinite
patience
the
diana
he
paused
and
drew
in
his
breath
you
think
that
you
may
get
the
diana
by
patience
also
she
asked
quietly
he
looked
at
her
with
a
gaze
that
seemed
to
pierce
all
her
subterfuges
i
waited
for
the
coningsby
venus
he
said
in
measured
tones
until
the
man
who
possessed
her
was
she
started
and
the
color
left
her
cheeks
you
mean
cyril
she
stammered
i
mean
he
replied
urbanely
precisely
nothing
except
that
i
will
never
give
you
she
recovered
her
poise
with
an
effort
and
when
she
replied
she
was
smiling
gayly
i
m
not
at
all
sure
that
i
want
to
be
given
up
she
said
with
a
laugh
that
was
meant
to
relax
the
tension
you
are
after
all
one
of
the
best
friends
i
i
hope
that
nothing
may
ever
happen
to
make
you
think
was
this
a
threat
she
glanced
at
him
keenly
as
she
quoted
friendship
is
constant
in
all
other
things
save
in
the
office
and
affairs
of
may
i
trust
you
try
no
i
might
put
you
to
a
test
that
would
be
try
very
well
i
will
go
back
to
london
in
the
he
looked
at
her
and
laughed
why
it
will
be
easier
for
you
to
be
patient
there
than
here
when
hammersley
comes
oh
she
said
quickly
then
he
coming
i
don
t
know
why
he
shouldn
t
he
said
slowly
there
was
a
pause
shall
you
go
to
london
i
ll
think
about
there
you
see
you
refuse
my
first
i
would
like
to
know
your
i
think
you
know
it
already
she
put
in
quickly
you
want
something
that
i
can
not
give
you
something
that
is
not
mine
to
she
had
come
out
into
the
open
defiantly
and
he
met
her
challenge
with
a
laugh
because
it
is
hammersley
s
he
said
you
think
so
and
hammersley
thinks
so
and
possession
is
nine
points
of
the
law
but
i
will
your
visit
is
vain
go
back
to
london
my
i
find
it
pleasanter
then
you
refuse
i
then
it
is
war
between
if
you
will
have
it
so
he
said
with
an
inclination
of
the
head
doris
put
her
foot
on
the
fender
and
leaned
with
her
hands
upon
her
knee
for
a
moment
as
though
in
deep
thought
then
she
turned
toward
the
door
come
she
said
coolly
let
us
join
the
there
was
a
relief
in
the
thought
that
at
least
they
had
come
to
an
understanding
and
that
the
matter
of
the
possession
of
the
papers
had
at
last
become
a
private
contest
between
them
she
had
brought
the
interview
to
an
end
not
because
she
was
afraid
to
continue
it
but
because
she
wanted
to
think
of
a
plan
to
disarm
him
she
felt
that
she
was
moving
in
the
dark
but
she
trusted
to
her
delicate
woman
s
sense
of
touch
to
stumble
upon
some
chance
some
slip
of
his
tongue
which
might
lead
her
into
the
light
in
the
by
common
consent
all
talk
of
war
had
been
abolished
she
sat
in
at
a
hand
of
auction
but
playing
badly
she
was
gladly
relinquished
by
her
partner
at
the
end
of
the
rubber
john
rizzio
who
disliked
the
game
had
gone
off
for
a
quiet
smoke
but
when
she
got
up
from
the
card
table
he
was
there
waiting
for
her
cyril
shall
know
of
this
laughed
betty
as
they
went
toward
the
door
they
say
that
absence
makes
the
heart
grow
fonder
of
the
other
doris
led
the
way
to
the
a
place
used
by
algie
heathcote
for
his
sporting
implements
and
trophies
of
the
chase
it
was
comfortably
furnished
in
leather
and
oak
and
a
cheerful
fire
was
burning
in
the
grate
doris
sank
into
the
davenport
and
motioned
to
her
companion
to
the
place
at
her
side
she
was
thoroughly
alive
to
her
danger
but
the
sportswoman
in
her
made
her
keen
to
put
it
to
the
test
we
are
quite
alone
here
she
said
coolly
the
others
are
not
even
within
call
now
what
do
you
want
of
me
her
audacity
rather
startled
him
but
he
folded
his
arms
and
leaned
back
smiling
the
papers
of
of
course
he
said
amiably
and
how
do
you
know
they
re
in
my
possession
he
shrugged
because
they
couldn
t
possibly
be
anywhere
how
do
you
know
because
i
have
exhausted
every
other
you
re
frank
at
least
including
the
burglary
at
ashwater
park
and
the
messing
in
my
box
upstairs
and
since
you
must
know
the
full
truth
he
continued
politely
the
careful
search
of
your
room
in
your
absence
this
evening
including
the
removal
of
the
rugs
and
bedding
oh
don
t
be
disturbed
i
beg
of
you
as
she
made
a
movement
of
alarm
they
have
all
been
replaced
with
a
nice
care
for
and
if
i
told
lady
heathcote
of
this
i
am
quite
sure
that
the
best
interests
of
all
he
said
politely
are
conserved
by
she
meditated
a
moment
her
gaze
on
the
coals
yes
she
said
slowly
you
re
clever
more
than
ordinarily
clever
i
can
t
understand
how
i
could
ever
have
refused
you
but
don
t
you
think
your
methods
have
been
a
little
er
unchivalrous
the
importance
of
my
objects
admitted
of
no
delay
i
hope
you
have
not
been
inconvenienced
not
in
the
least
calmly
my
recollection
of
your
many
civilities
merely
made
me
think
that
your
agents
were
i
am
sorry
he
said
genuinely
it
could
not
be
helped
you
and
i
are
merely
pawns
in
a
game
greater
than
anything
the
world
has
ever
i
didn
t
want
you
to
apologize
i
merely
thought
in
order
to
avoid
comment
that
you
might
have
come
to
me
i
thought
i
might
save
you
the
unpleasantness
of
a
controversy
which
can
only
have
one
you
mean
that
you
will
i
how
you
will
give
me
the
papers
here
and
if
i
told
you
that
i
had
destroyed
them
that
would
be
manifestly
untrue
since
at
the
present
moment
in
the
position
of
your
body
their
outline
is
quite
clearly
defined
on
the
inside
of
your
right
doris
put
both
slippers
upon
the
ground
her
feet
together
her
face
flushing
warmly
i
hope
you
will
forgive
my
frankness
she
heard
him
say
gently
but
the
method
of
your
challenge
is
she
clasped
her
hands
around
her
knees
and
frowned
into
the
fire
you
mistake
i
think
my
friend
it
is
not
a
challenge
it
is
merely
a
method
of
defense
the
safest
i
am
sure
against
john
he
bowed
low
with
deep
ceremony
of
course
i
am
and
then
i
can
only
rely
on
your
good
sense
and
here
his
voice
sunk
a
note
lower
and
on
your
loyalty
to
the
cause
of
this
was
the
opening
that
she
had
been
waiting
for
she
thrust
quickly
and
if
the
cause
is
england
s
why
didn
t
scotland
yard
come
to
ashwater
park
dunsinane
to
burnam
wood
he
shrugged
they
would
have
made
asinine
mistakes
as
they
always
do
the
chief
of
which
would
have
been
that
of
denouncing
miss
doris
mather
as
an
agent
of
england
s
the
girl
tapped
her
toe
reflectively
upon
the
rug
i
won
t
attempt
subterfuge
of
course
i
know
the
contents
of
that
you
wouldn
t
be
a
woman
if
you
didn
and
how
it
was
passed
from
captain
byfield
to
cyril
this
was
a
random
shot
but
it
hit
the
mark
rizzio
s
eyes
dilated
slightly
but
she
saw
them
byfield
not
at
all
cyril
told
me
she
lied
he
told
you
he
paused
aghast
for
now
she
was
laughing
at
him
no
but
you
his
brow
tangled
and
he
folded
his
arms
again
of
course
you
know
the
importance
to
cyril
and
captain
byfield
of
keeping
such
a
matter
he
had
not
heard
he
did
not
know
she
remembered
that
the
subject
of
the
dreadful
news
from
london
had
not
been
reopened
and
jack
sandys
sources
of
information
were
probably
semiofficial
she
controlled
her
voice
with
an
effort
i
would
hardly
be
the
one
to
mention
names
under
the
circumstances
since
my
own
fortunes
seem
to
be
involved
in
the
matter
but
as
for
captain
byfield
i
m
afraid
that
further
secrecy
will
hardly
help
what
do
you
mean
merely
that
he
was
arrested
late
yesterday
afternoon
as
he
was
leaving
the
war
she
had
not
counted
on
the
effect
she
created
she
knew
that
her
last
thrust
had
put
him
more
carefully
on
guard
but
he
could
not
hide
the
sudden
intake
of
breath
and
the
quick
searching
glance
his
dark
eyes
shot
at
her
what
is
your
source
of
information
jack
sandys
he
came
here
directly
from
downing
she
saw
rizzio
s
lips
meet
under
his
mustache
in
a
thin
line
so
it
has
come
sooner
than
i
he
got
up
and
paced
the
floor
his
fingers
twitching
behind
his
back
she
said
nothing
waiting
for
him
to
rejoin
her
when
he
did
it
was
with
a
serious
expression
i
suppose
you
know
what
this
means
to
to
hammersley
he
said
in
a
low
voice
doris
sat
without
moving
but
her
brain
was
busy
weighing
rizzio
no
she
replied
calmly
i
don
t
won
t
you
tell
me
he
leaned
forward
toward
her
along
the
back
of
their
seat
his
look
and
voice
concentrated
upon
her
is
it
possible
he
continued
that
you
haven
t
realized
by
this
time
exactly
what
cyril
hammersley
is
no
she
said
staunchly
i
will
believe
nothing
of
him
unless
he
tells
it
to
me
he
waited
a
moment
watching
her
and
fancied
that
he
saw
her
lips
tremble
slightly
her
loyalty
to
hammersley
inflamed
him
he
followed
up
his
advantage
quickly
there
are
reasons
why
i
should
dislike
to
give
you
pain
greater
reasons
why
i
should
be
generous
with
a
successful
rival
and
i
have
done
what
i
can
to
take
this
matter
out
of
your
hands
there
is
still
time
will
you
give
me
that
packet
she
shook
her
head
then
i
must
speak
he
went
on
my
duty
demands
it
whatever
happens
to
him
whatever
happens
to
you
don
t
make
me
go
to
extremes
with
you
i
can
not
bear
to
do
it
hammersley
is
a
german
spy
those
papers
were
to
be
forwarded
to
germany
you
are
saving
them
for
him
that
he
may
betray
that
is
not
true
she
said
chokingly
i
do
not
believe
you
must
isn
t
there
proof
enough
in
what
you
have
read
there
is
some
no
there
can
t
be
your
sentiments
are
blinding
one
moment
doris
had
risen
and
faced
him
across
the
hearth
a
new
fire
of
resolution
in
her
eyes
to
rizzio
the
lover
of
beauty
she
was
a
mockery
of
lost
happiness
she
was
diana
not
the
huntress
but
the
hunted
you
have
told
me
what
cyril
hammersley
is
now
if
you
please
i
would
like
to
know
what
are
he
paused
a
moment
and
then
with
a
step
toward
her
said
gently
i
think
my
interests
should
be
fairly
obvious
i
am
acting
for
the
english
i
have
only
your
word
for
it
have
you
any
papers
that
would
prove
it
in
your
for
instance
he
started
back
his
fingers
instinctively
reaching
upward
then
he
shrugged
and
laughed
you
are
surely
the
most
amazing
person
unfortunately
i
have
no
documents
i
am
only
doing
my
duty
as
a
private
citizen
a
loyal
resident
of
the
but
not
a
briton
neither
am
i
we
meet
on
equal
then
you
refuse
me
definitely
yes
i
i
beg
that
you
will
consider
carefully
the
alternatives
if
you
give
me
the
papers
silence
on
my
part
safety
for
hammersley
if
you
refuse
to
give
them
up
he
paused
then
what
will
you
do
she
defied
him
it
would
be
the
most
terrible
moment
of
my
life
but
i
will
denounce
him
here
tonight
tomorrow
in
london
those
papers
must
not
reach
germany
even
if
i
have
to
denounce
you
and
if
i
promise
that
the
papers
will
not
reach
germany
he
hesitated
a
moment
there
is
too
much
at
stake
i
can
t
take
the
risk
no
woman
can
be
trusted
not
even
the
woman
john
rizzio
would
have
made
his
wife
he
moved
his
shoulders
expressively
her
youth
and
cleverness
were
bewildering
him
no
that
will
not
do
he
said
in
desperation
you
must
give
me
the
i
will
not
you
shall
have
to
take
them
from
he
leaned
toward
her
along
the
mantel
aware
of
her
dominant
loveliness
you
would
not
drive
me
to
that
yes
it
a
challenge
i
offer
it
i
will
fight
you
and
i
am
strong
i
have
a
voice
and
i
will
raise
an
outcry
they
will
come
and
i
will
tell
them
then
you
can
denounce
me
will
you
dare
he
came
toward
her
while
she
fled
around
the
davenport
eluding
him
with
ease
she
was
swifter
of
foot
than
he
he
stopped
a
moment
near
the
to
plead
she
kept
the
huge
oak
lounge
between
them
and
listened
by
the
fire
something
she
saw
in
his
eyes
decided
her
for
as
he
came
forward
to
leap
over
the
davenport
she
threw
something
yellow
toward
him
he
gave
a
gasp
of
relief
picked
the
object
up
and
made
a
cry
of
dismay
the
cover
i
must
have
the
papers
he
cried
coming
forward
again
by
this
time
the
girl
was
standing
upright
a
poker
in
one
hand
the
thin
cigarette
papers
cramped
in
the
fingers
of
the
other
over
the
open
fire
rizzio
paused
in
the
very
act
of
leaping
not
that
he
whispered
hoarsely
for
god
s
sake
not
illustration
not
that
he
whispered
hoarsely
for
god
s
sake
not
stay
where
you
are
then
said
the
girl
in
a
low
resolute
tone
rizzio
straightened
doris
still
bent
over
the
fire
give
it
to
me
he
said
again
no
england
s
secrets
shall
be
don
t
you
understand
he
whispered
wildly
i
ve
got
to
prove
that
they
i
can
prove
that
as
well
as
you
but
you
won
t
hammersley
is
he
paused
and
both
of
them
straightened
listening
outside
in
the
hall
there
was
a
commotion
and
a
familiar
voice
as
the
honorable
cyril
his
face
and
fur
coat
spattered
with
mud
came
into
the
room
chapter
vii
an
intruder
he
looked
from
one
to
the
other
with
a
quickly
appraising
eye
the
girl
was
fingering
the
lace
of
her
bodice
rizzio
had
turned
toward
the
newcomer
recovering
his
poise
hope
i
m
not
intrudin
said
hammersley
with
a
laugh
well
hardly
you
ve
come
in
a
yes
drawled
hammersley
i
missed
your
train
i
think
too
bad
jolly
slow
work
travelin
alone
stryker
picked
me
up
at
edinburgh
and
we
came
on
by
he
took
off
his
fur
coat
in
leisurely
fashion
and
crossing
to
the
fireplace
took
doris
s
proffered
hand
you
had
my
note
he
asked
carelessly
the
girl
nodded
i
was
glad
she
said
well
i
m
here
jolly
happy
too
had
a
narrow
squeak
of
it
though
some
bally
idiot
stretched
rope
across
the
road
over
by
saltham
rocks
but
we
saw
it
in
time
and
went
around
fired
a
few
shots
at
us
too
must
have
taken
me
for
rizzio
what
he
laughed
thus
directly
appealed
to
rizzio
smiled
grudgingly
you
don
t
ask
me
to
believe
that
story
hammersley
he
said
dryly
you
don
t
have
to
the
girl
s
look
was
fixed
on
hammersley
s
face
suddenly
she
broke
in
with
a
voice
of
alarm
cyril
you
re
hurt
and
there
s
blood
on
your
coat
is
there
by
jove
so
there
is
it
doesn
t
matter
i
wouldn
t
mind
a
peg
though
and
a
doris
had
started
for
the
door
in
alarm
wait
hammersley
s
voice
came
sharply
and
as
she
paused
ring
she
understood
and
touched
the
button
beside
the
door
we
might
as
well
have
an
understanding
before
they
come
rizzio
put
in
hammersley
quickly
do
you
prefer
to
believe
my
story
or
would
you
like
to
invent
one
of
your
own
rizzio
shrugged
as
you
please
he
said
it
seems
that
i
am
at
the
door
he
paused
and
finished
distinctly
i
hope
that
your
explanations
will
prove
doris
had
helped
cyril
off
with
his
coat
and
by
the
time
the
maid
brought
betty
heathcote
had
cut
away
the
sleeve
of
his
shirt
with
cyril
s
pocket
knife
it
was
merely
a
gash
across
the
upper
arm
which
a
bandage
and
some
remedies
would
set
right
lady
heathcote
heard
the
story
from
which
hammersley
eliminated
the
rope
with
amazement
and
was
for
sending
at
once
for
the
local
constabulary
oh
it
s
hardly
worth
while
said
the
honorable
cyril
sipping
his
whiskey
and
water
comfortably
poor
devils
out
of
work
i
fancy
wanted
my
money
if
they
d
come
to
tomorrow
i
d
give
it
to

but
i
wouldn
t
mind
betty
if
you
could
put
me
up
for
the
night
i
m
not
keen
to
be
dodgin
bullets
in
the
of

said
lady
heathcote
how
extraordinary
i
can
t
understand
saltham
rocks
that
s
on
my
place
something
must
be
done
hammersley
yawned
oh

t
catch
the
beggars
in
the
dark
besides
it
s
late
do
me
a
favor
betty
don

let
those
people
come
in
here
again
i
want
a
word
with
he
had
stretched
himself
out
comfortably
on
the
davenport
his
eyes
on
the
girl
who
still
stood
uncertainly
beside
him
lady
betty
shrugged
and
taking
up
her
basin
and
lotion
moved
toward
the
door
it
s
most
mysterious
are
you
sure
we
re
quite
safe
quite
but
i
think
it
might
be
better
if
i
had
the
room
between
yours
and
doris
i
was
putting
john
rizzio
well
change
there
s
a
dear
and
say
nothing
about
it
i
i
might
need
a
new
dressing
on
this
thing
in
the
she
examined
him
curiously
but
he
was
looking
lazily
into
the
fire
having
already
taken
her
acquiescence
for
granted
when
she
went
out
hammersley
sat
up
and
threw
his
cigarette
into
the
fire
you
have
it
still
he
whispered
anxiously
taking
doris
by
both
hands
she
nodded
thank
god
for
that
i
seemed
to
have
arrived
at
the
proper
i
was
about
to
burn
he
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
you
know
what
they
are
yes
i
read
i
was
afraid
you
would
you
have
spoken
to
no
no
proudly
hardly
after
what
i
went
and
with
an
air
of
restraint
she
told
him
everything
he
listened
a
serious
look
in
his
eyes
it
was
my
fault
i
should
have
left
them
in
the
machine
i
got
away
scot
yes
i
know
i
saw
you
poor
child
he
said
softly
i
was
desperate
i
thought
it
necessary
how
can
i
ever
thank
you
you
can
the
tones
of
her
voice
were
strange
i
d
jolly
well
give
my
life
for
you
doris
you
know
that
he
said
earnestly
it
s
something
less
than
that
that
i
want
and
something
more
your
word
of
my
word
yes
she
went
on
quietly
to
forswear
your
german
kinship
and
give
me
an
oath
of
loyalty
to
england
difficult
as
it
is
i
ll
believe
sh
he
glanced
toward
the
door
all
the
windows
of
the
room
were
closed
he
told
you
that
i
was
a
german
spy
he
whispered
anxiously
you
forget
that
i
had
proof
of
that
he
sat
up
and
looked
into
the
fire
i
hoped
you
wouldn
t
read
em
it
has
done
no
i
have
no
regrets
i
will
not
betray
england
cyril
even
for
he
rose
and
paced
the
rug
in
front
of
her
for
a
moment
then
he
spoke
incredulously
in
a
whisper
you
mean
that
you
won
t
give
em
to
me
i
mean
that
but
that
is
impossible
he
went
on
with
greater
signs
of
excitement
than
she
had
ever
seen
in
him
don
t
you
realize
now
that
every
moment
the
things
are
in
your
possession
you
re
in
danger
great
danger
isn
t
what
you
ve
gone
through
isn
t
this
and
he
indicated
his
arm
the
proof
of
it
yes
she
said
firmly
but
i
would
rather
suffer
injury
myself
than
see
you
share
the
fate
of
captain
he
started
oh
you
heard
that
yes
jack
sandys
is
she
put
her
face
in
her
hands
in
the
throes
of
her
doubts
of
him
and
then
suddenly
thrust
out
her
hands
and
laced
her
fingers
around
his
arm
oh
give
it
up
cyril
for
my
sake
give
it
all
up
can
t
you
see
the
terrible
position
you
ve
placed
me
in
if
i
give
these
papers
to
jack
sandys
they
ll
come
and
take
you
as
they
took
captain
byfield
i
ve
kept
them
for
you
because
i
promised
but
i
can
not
let
this
information
get
to
germany
i
would
die
first
what
shall
i
do
she
wailed
what
on
earth
i
do
his
reply
made
her
gasp
there
s
a
fire
he
said
quietly
burn
her
fingers
went
to
her
corsage
and
her
eyes
gleamed
with
a
new
hope
she
took
the
crumpled
out
and
looked
at
them
then
in
a
flash
the
thought
came
to
her
you
know
the
information
contained
in
these
papers
she
asked
in
an
accent
of
deprecation
no
he
replied
shortly
i
merely
glanced
at
you
hadn
t
the
chance
to
study
them
still
she
hesitated
but
what
what
is
rizzio
he
walked
to
the
door
of
the
room
opening
it
suddenly
then
he
shut
it
quietly
and
coming
back
to
the
fire
took
the
poker
and
made
a
hole
between
the
glowing
coals
burn
em
he
commanded
she
obeyed
him
wonderingly
and
together
they
watched
the
package
of
flame
into
a
live
coal
and
then
turn
to
ashes
when
the
last
vestige
of
them
had
disappeared
they
sat
together
on
the
davenport
cyril
thoughtful
the
girl
bewildered
what
is
rizzio
she
repeated
he
told
me
that
he
was
an
agent
of
the
english
i
can
t
tell
you
he
whispered
hoarsely
i
can
t
tell
you
anything
even
you
don
t
you
understand
no
i
don
t
it
s
your
word
against
his
i
would
rather
believe
you
than
him
i
want
to
cyril
god
knows
i
want
didn
t
i
ask
you
to
burn
the
papers
didn
t
he
try
to
prevent
it
can
t
you
see
if
he
were
acting
for
england
it
wouldn
t
matter
what
became
of
em
if
they
didn
t
reach
oh
i
thought
of
that
but
what
you
have
told
me
bewilders
me
why
should
you
run
away
with
secrets
of
england
given
you
by
a
traitor
who
is
about
to
pay
the
penalty
with
with
death
what
does
it
mean
why
didn
t
you
take
those
papers
at
once
to
the
war
office
why
did
captain
byfield
give
them
to
you
he
a
traitor
to
you
cyril
it
is
all
so
horrible
i
am
frightened
your
danger
rizzio
s
men
here
tonight
all
about
if
they
were
english
secret
service
men
cyril
put
in
quietly
wouldn
t
they
come
here
to
this
house
and
arrest
me
in
the
name
of
the
law
yes
there
must
be
other
reasons
why
they
can
t
what
is
the
contest
between
you
and
rizzio
tell
me
tell
me
everything
i
will
believe
you
haven
t
i
kept
your
trust
if
i
could
do
that
for
your
sake
do
you
not
think
that
i
could
keep
silent
for
england
s
sake
her
arms
were
about
his
neck
and
her
lips
very
close
to
his
but
he
turned
his
head
away
so
that
the
temptation
might
not
be
too
strong
for
him
i
can
t
he
muttered
i
can
not
speak
even
to
you
i
am
sworn
to
she
drooped
upon
his
arms
and
then
moved
away
despairingly
it
was
the
failure
of
the
appeal
of
her
femininity
that
condemned
him
oh
you
won
t
let
me
believe
in
you
you
won
t
let
me
it
s
too
great
a
test
you
re
asking
of
me
everything
is
against
you
but
the
worst
witness
is
your
silence
he
stood
by
the
mantel
his
head
lowered
it
is
hard
for
you
hard
for
us
both
he
said
softly
but
i
can
t
tell
you
anythin
anythin
he
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
her
with
pity
she
had
sunk
upon
the
divan
her
head
upon
her
arms
in
a
despair
too
deep
for
tears
he
crossed
and
laid
his
hand
gently
upon
her
shoulder
you
must
trust
in
me
if
you
can
i
will
try
to
be
worthy
of
it
that
s
all
i
can
he
paused
and
now
you
must
go
to
bed
you
re
a
bit
fagged
perhaps
in
the
mornin
you
ll
pull
up
a
bit
and
see
things
she
straightened
slowly
and
their
eyes
met
for
a
moment
his
never
wavered
and
she
saw
that
they
were
very
kind
but
she
rose
silently
and
without
offering
him
her
lips
or
even
her
hand
moved
slowly
toward
the
door
he
reached
it
in
a
stride
before
her
and
put
his
hand
upon
the
knob
there
s
one
thing
more
i
ve
got
to
her
look
questioned
you
must
sleep
in
my
room
tonight
next
to
betty
s
i
shall
sleep
in
her
weary
eyes
sought
his
with
an
effort
you
mean
you
think
rizzio
would
still
she
paused
yes
he
thinks
you
would
not
give
them
to
and
then
with
a
laugh
you
wouldn
t
you
and
if
i
tell
him
i
have
burned
them
he
will
not
believe
he
would
not
believe
me
she
repeated
in
a
daze
you
must
do
what
i
ask
cyril
went
on
quietly
i
know
what
is
best
i
ll
arrange
it
with
he
glanced
at
his
watch
one
o
clock
by
jove
it
s
time
even
for
auction
she
promised
him
at
last
after
a
protest
on
his
own
account
nothin
to
worry
about
he
laughed
they
may
not
try
anythin
and
when
they
find
i
m
there
they
ll
bundle
out
in
a
thus
reassured
she
went
out
to
the
where
the
card
players
were
just
rising
rizzio
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
cyril
at
once
took
their
hostess
aside
and
told
her
that
doris
was
a
little
upset
by
the
shooting
asking
if
betty
would
mind
letting
her
take
the
room
next
to
her
own
so
that
she
could
open
the
door
between
don
t
say
anything
about
it
betty
he
urged
just
ask
her
in
won
t
you
when
you
get
and
you
i
could
do
a
turn
on
steel
spikes
he
laughed
your
arm
right
as
rain
it
s
nothing
at
doris
accepted
the
situation
without
a
word
indeed
she
was
numbed
with
the
fatigue
of
strained
nerves
the
swift
rush
of
incident
since
betty
s
london
dinner
with
its
rapid
alternations
of
hope
and
fear
had
left
her
bewildered
and
helpless
but
it
was
the
interview
with
cyril
tonight
that
had
plunged
her
into
the
dark
abyss
of
despair
she
had
tried
so
hard
to
believe
in
him
but
he
would
do
nothing
to
take
away
the
weight
that
had
been
dragging
her
down
further
and
further
from
the
light
a
new
kind
of
love
had
come
to
her
born
of
the
new
cyril
who
had
won
her
over
by
the
sheer
force
of
a
personality
the
existence
of
which
she
had
not
dreamed
a
short
time
ago
she
had
wanted
to
see
him
awake
a
firebrand
and
she
had
had
her
wish
for
she
had
kindled
to
his
touch
like
tinder
but
tonight
in
her
utter
weariness
it
seemed
as
though
her
spirit
was
charred
burnt
to
a
cinder
like
the
package
of
papers
in
the
grate
in
the
destroyed
as
the
secret
message
had
been
in
the
great
game
that
cyril
was
playing
she
undressed
slowly
listening
for
any
sounds
that
might
come
from
the
room
next
door
but
the
only
sign
she
had
of
him
was
the
familiar
smell
of
his
pipe
tobacco
which
came
through
the
cracks
and
a
little
later
betty
heathcote
came
in
prepared
for
what
she
called
a
back
hair
talk
but
found
her
guest
so
unresponsive
that
at
last
she
went
into
her
own
room
and
bed
doris
lay
for
a
while
watching
the
line
of
light
under
cyril
s
door
wondering
what
he
was
doing
and
what
the
night
was
to
bring
forth
one
memory
persisted
in
the
chaos
of
the
night
s
events
cyril
didn
t
know
the
contents
of
the
papers
and
yet
he
had
commanded
her
to
burn
them
the
thought
quieted
her
and
at
last
she
saw
the
light
in
his
room
go
out
then
after
a
time
in
spite
of
her
weariness
she
slept
she
awakened
trembling
with
terror
listening
for
she
knew
not
what
and
then
as
her
wits
slowly
came
to
her
she
was
aware
of
the
sounds
which
had
awakened
her
they
were
suppressed
secret
and
strange
but
none
the
less
terrible
the
shuffling
of
feet
hoarse
whispers
and
the
creaking
of
straining
furniture
she
sat
upright
slipped
to
the
floor
quickly
and
getting
into
the
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
middle
of
the
room
her
heart
beating
wildly
then
with
quick
resolution
she
moved
swiftly
to
betty
heathcote
s
room
and
after
assuring
herself
that
her
hostess
still
slept
closed
the
door
softly
and
passed
the
bolt
again
she
hesitated
the
sounds
from
cyril
s
room
continued
the
hard
breathing
of
men
who
seemed
with
one
accord
to
be
trying
to
keep
their
struggles
silent
aware
of
her
danger
but
considering
it
less
than
the
physical
need
for
immediate
action
with
trembling
fingers
she
turned
the
key
and
quickly
opened
the
door
at
first
silence
utter
and
profound
but
full
of
a
terror
which
a
breath
might
reveal
cyril
what
is
it
she
managed
to
whisper
sh
she
heard
and
dimly
in
the
pale
moonlight
she
made
out
the
dark
blur
of
figures
upon
the
floor
in
the
corner
of
the
room
cyril
she
repeated
it
s
all
right
she
heard
in
a
breathless
whisper
go
back
to
your
room
it
s
nothin
but
having
ventured
thus
far
she
did
not
hesitate
and
closing
the
door
behind
her
came
forward
upon
the
floor
half
against
the
wall
was
the
figure
of
a
man
cyril
was
sitting
on
his
legs
and
holding
him
with
one
hand
by
the
neck
cloth
you
re
safe
she
whispered
yes
go
back
to
bed
don
t
you
understand
if
anyone
came
i
don
t
her
curiosity
had
triumphed
she
leaned
forward
and
saw
that
it
was
john
rizzio
rizzio
she
whispered
my
room
i
ought
to
kill
him
doris
said
cyril
savagely
but
i
ve
only
choked
him
a
little
he
ll
come
around
in
a
and
then
more
quietly
get
me
a
glass
of
water
but
don
t
make
a
fuss
and
don
t
make
a
light
there
are
men
she
obeyed
and
in
a
moment
rizzio
revived
and
sat
up
cyril
standing
over
him
his
fist
clenched
oh
let
him
go
cyril
please
doris
pleaded
at
the
sound
of
the
girl
s
voice
rizzio
started
and
with
cyril
s
help
struggled
to
his
feet
yes
he
s
going
the
way
he
came
by
the
window
growled
hammersley
head
first
if
i
have
my
rizzio
succeeded
in
a
smile
though
he
was
still
struggling
for
breath
i
suppose
i
i
must
thank
you
for
your
generosity
hammersley
he
said
with
as
fine
a
return
of
his
composure
as
his
throat
permitted
i
have
been
guilty
of
of
an
error
in
judgment
i
m
sorry
you
think
it
s
only
that
said
cyril
dryly
now
go
he
whispered
threateningly
pointing
to
the
window
in
a
moment
with
your
permission
he
said
recovering
his
suavity
with
his
breath
in
extenuation
of
this
visit
terrible
as
it
seems
to
miss
mather
i
i
can
only
say
that
if
i
had
succeeded
i
would
have
saved
her
from
remembering
some
day
that
she
had
given
england
s
secrets
into
the
hands
of
the
you
re
mistaken
said
doris
quietly
i
have
burned
you
you
burned
them
yes
rizzio
peered
at
her
in
silence
for
a
long
moment
and
then
shrugged
oh
he
said
in
that
case
i
have
made
two
errors
in
judgment
you
ll
make
a
third
if
you
re
not
out
of
that
window
in
half
a
second
said
cyril
but
rizzio
laughed
at
him
i
don
t
think
it
would
be
wise
to
make
a
disturbance
he
said
coolly
i
think
miss
mather
will
admit
my
generosity
to
herself
and
to
you
when
i
say
that
i
ve
only
to
raise
my
voice
and
have
half
a
dozen
men
up
here
in
a
doris
clutched
him
fearfully
by
the
arm
thinking
of
cyril
you
d
not
do
that
hammersley
laughed
dryly
there
s
no
danger
he
said
no
returned
rizzio
with
a
touch
of
his
old
magnificence
there
is
no
danger
of
that
the
reasons
are
as
he
moved
toward
the
window
hammersley
touched
him
lightly
on
the
arm
i
warn
you
rizzio
he
said
in
a
low
concentrated
tone
that
you
re
playing
a
dangerous
hand
i
should
punish
you
but
other
agencies
rizzio
halted
yes
other
agencies
he
replied
significantly
he
bowed
in
the
girl
s
direction
and
sitting
on
the
he
threw
his
feet
outside
i
bid
you
good
and
carefully
feeling
for
his
footing
he
slowly
descended
cyril
hammersley
followed
him
to
the
window
and
doris
took
a
step
in
his
direction
when
her
thinly
slippered
foot
touched
something
in
the
wooden
floor
something
which
slid
upon
the
polished
surface
from
the
shadow
into
the
moonlight
instinctively
she
glanced
down
and
then
started
scarcely
restraining
a
gasp
there
unmistakable
in
the
shape
and
color
for
so
many
hours
graven
on
her
mind
was
a
yellow
packet
of
cigarette
papers
she
glanced
at
cyril
who
was
closing
the
casement
window
then
stooped
and
picking
up
the
packet
fled
noiselessly
into
her
room
and
quickly
locked
the
door
chapter
viii
evidence
inside
her
own
room
she
stood
for
a
moment
tremulously
in
the
dark
fingering
the
guilty
thing
in
her
hands
as
she
had
fingered
the
other
one
the
one
she
had
destroyed
or
hadn
t
she
destroyed
it
for
a
moment
the
thought
came
to
her
that
cyril
had
practiced
some
trick
upon
her
when
they
had
knelt
before
the
fire
substituting
other
papers
for
the
ones
that
were
to
be
burned
but
that
was
impossible
the
papers
had
not
touched
his
fingers
he
it
was
who
had
made
a
hole
for
them
in
the
fire
but
her
fingers
had
thrust
the
original
papers
into
the
glowing
coals
she
turned
the
packet
over
and
over
in
her
fingers
glancing
at
the
closed
door
that
separated
her
from
cyril
another
message
it
must
be
she
pulled
the
curtains
at
the
window
and
then
moving
quietly
to
the
bed
lit
the
candle
on
the
another
packet
of
new
like
the
other
with
its
tiny
thin
rubber
band
she
opened
it
quickly
and
scanned
its
pages
finding
what
she
sought
without
difficulty
the
writing
was
not
in
the
same
hand
it
was
rounder
and
less
minute
covering
in
all
seven
pages
and
it
was
written
carelessly
as
if
the
writer
had
been
in
a
hurry
cyril
s
own
handwriting
it
seemed
the
purport
of
its
message
was
the
same
no
she
remembered
the
dates
these
were
somewhat
different
the
names
of
the
regiments
were
the
same
but
the
dates
instead
of
days
in
april
and
may
gave
days
in
the
months
of
june
and
july
and
the
numerals
which
at
first
had
puzzled
her
were
smaller
for
instance
among
highland
regiments
foot
the
numerals
of
which
she
remembered
particularly
instead
of
she
saw
the
numerals
it
was
the
same
under
other
headings
in
the
remainder
of
the
items
under
shrapnel
there
were
changes
and
under
artillery
she
closed
the
packet
in
icy
fingers
for
the
figures
swam
before
her
eyes
they
were
all
true
all
the
horrible
things
that
she
had
thought
of
cyril
this
was
later
and
more
accurate
information
the
exact
reason
for
which
she
did
not
pretend
to
understand
and
was
intended
to
follow
the
previous
message
perhaps
to
be
used
as
a
code
in
connection
with
it
cyril
was
oh
the
dishonor
of
it
and
she
had
gone
to
sleep
almost
ready
to
believe
in
him
again
because
he
had
let
her
burn
the
other
papers
what
did
it
matter
to
him
whether
she
burned
the
papers
when
he
had
other
messages
to
send
and
had
committed
to
memory
the
facts
he
had
let
her
destroy
he
had
lied
to
her
he
was
false
as
judas
and
more
dangerous
for
now
she
knew
that
he
was
desperate
as
well
as
cunning
stooping
to
any
means
no
matter
how
ignoble
to
gain
his
ends
she
had
been
a
mere
bauble
in
his
hands
a
child
upon
whose
credulity
he
had
played
without
scruple
he
had
used
her
the
woman
he
had
said
he
loved
for
his
own
unworthy
ends
as
he
used
betty
heathcote
and
her
house
she
was
filled
with
shame
for
him
and
for
herself
who
could
love
something
shameful
and
john
rizzio
rizzio
cyril
s
enemy
stood
for
england
and
right
and
she
had
permitted
herself
to
see
through
cyril
s
eyes
just
as
cyril
had
wanted
her
to
see
it
seemed
as
she
compared
them
that
rizzio
s
nobility
attained
a
firmer
contour
he
had
come
to
her
room
to
save
her
from
her
own
ignorance
and
wilfulness
from
committing
a
crime
the
greatest
of
all
crimes
against
england
rizzio
knew
what
cyril
was
and
on
her
account
had
refrained
from
giving
cyril
up
to
the
officers
of
the
law
although
they
were
within
call
even
when
he
felt
himself
yielding
to
the
fury
of
cyril
s
superior
physical
strength
not
even
the
spirit
of
revenge
for
the
punishment
cyril
had
given
him
not
even
the
humiliation
he
had
suffered
before
her
eyes
had
been
enough
to
make
him
forget
his
intention
to
save
if
he
could
for
the
woman
who
loved
him
a
successful
rival
and
she
doris
had
stood
by
cyril
s
side
warm
in
cyril
s
cause
against
the
one
man
who
held
cyril
s
fate
as
the
bearer
of
treacherous
messages
in
his
hand
there
was
still
danger
in
the
air
the
last
words
of
the
two
men
to
each
other
had
been
hidden
threats
of
other
agencies
whatever
they
were
and
she
found
herself
praying
in
a
whisper
that
the
agency
of
england
even
if
it
meant
cyril
s
danger
might
conquer
o
god
it
would
have
been
better
it
seemed
if
the
bullet
at
saltham
rocks
that
had
grazed
cyril
s
arm
had
killed
him
that
death
would
at
least
have
been
free
from
the
shame
of
that
which
awaited
captain
byfield
she
gazed
with
wide
eyes
at
her
guttering
candle
she
was
wishing
for
cyril
s
death
she
shivered
with
pity
for
herself
and
for
him
and
huddled
down
in
the
bed
a
very
small
very
miserable
object
seeking
in
vain
some
hope
some
rest
for
her
mind
amid
the
torture
of
her
thoughts
suddenly
she
started
up
and
sat
clutching
the
yellow
packet
to
her
breast
her
gaze
fixed
on
the
door
into
cyril
s
room
had
she
heard
a
knock
or
was
it
only
imagination
yes
there
it
was
again
she
leaned
over
hurriedly
and
blew
out
the
candle
and
lay
very
still
her
teeth
chattering
with
the
cold
her
body
trembling
he
was
knocking
again
a
little
louder
this
time
and
she
heard
his
voice
through
the
keyhole
whispering
her
name
she
made
no
response
and
feigned
sleep
he
knocked
again
still
louder
and
she
heard
her
name
spoken
quite
distinctly
he
would
awaken
the
house
if
this
went
on
when
he
knocked
again
she
got
up
and
went
over
to
the
door
doris
he
was
saying
she
answered
him
will
you
open
the
door
just
a
crack
no
she
whispered
i
want
to
speak
to
you
can
not
i
m
listening
what
do
you
want
to
say
i
ve
lost
something
something
that
must
have
fallen
from
my
she
was
silent
and
then
in
quick
anxious
tones
you
didn
t
see
anythin
on
the
floor
by
the
door
no
she
lied
trembling
i
didn
she
heard
him
mutter
you
re
sure
came
his
voice
again
and
then
in
dubious
tones
oh
very
well
then
sorry
to
have
troubled
you
good
she
didn
t
reply
and
stole
back
through
the
darkness
to
her
bed
into
which
she
crept
like
some
thin
wraith
of
vengeance
biding
her
time
into
bed
but
not
to
sleep
she
watched
the
moonlight
grow
pale
into
the
west
and
saw
the
first
gray
streaks
of
dawn
paint
the
wooded
slopes
of
ben
darrah
across
the
valley
of
the
dorth
in
pity
for
herself
and
cyril
she
watched
the
new
day
born
a
new
day
bleak
and
cheerless
which
seemed
by
its
very
aspect
to
pronounce
a
sentence
upon
them
the
new
day
which
was
to
mark
the
passing
of
all
the
things
growing
womanhood
holds
most
dear
her
first
faith
her
first
tenderness
her
first
passion
doris
kept
to
her
room
until
betty
came
in
awakening
her
from
a
heavy
sleep
into
which
she
had
fallen
just
before
sunrise
lady
heathcote
rang
for
wilson
and
then
retired
to
the
ministrations
of
her
own
maid
leaving
doris
to
dress
for
the
morning
at
her
leisure
and
when
the
girl
got
downstairs
to
breakfast
she
found
that
the
other
guests
had
preceded
her
but
betty
heathcote
was
still
in
the
breakfast
room
picking
with
dainty
fingers
at
the
various
dishes
upon
the
sideboard
and
making
sparkling
comment
as
was
her
custom
on
men
and
things
she
found
the
disappearance
of
john
rizzio
bag
baggage
and
man
from
kilmorack
house
without
even
a
line
to
his
hostess
both
unusual
and
surprising
since
her
guest
was
a
man
who
made
much
of
the
amenities
and
forms
of
proper
behavior
doris
commented
in
a
desultory
way
trying
to
put
on
an
air
of
cheerfulness
aware
of
cyril
hammersley
somewhere
in
the
background
awaiting
the
chance
to
speak
to
her
alone
she
did
not
hurry
and
when
betty
arose
sauntered
into
the
library
where
the
other
guests
were
waiting
for
the
horses
to
come
around
twice
cyril
tried
to
speak
to
her
but
she
avoided
him
skillfully
contriving
to
be
a
part
of
a
group
where
personal
topics
were
not
to
be
discussed
that
kind
of
maneuvering
she
knew
was
a
game
at
which
any
woman
is
more
than
a
match
for
any
man
but
she
saw
by
the
cloud
that
was
growing
in
cyril
s
eyes
that
he
was
not
in
the
mood
to
be
put
off
with
excuses
and
realized
that
the
sooner
the
pain
of
their
interview
was
over
the
better
it
would
be
for
both
of
them
she
was
dressed
in
the
long
coat
and
breeches
which
she
wore
in
the
hunting
field
and
in
her
waistcoat
pocket
was
the
yellow
packet
i
ve
got
to
see
you
for
half
an
hour
alone
he
said
at
last
taking
the
bull
by
the
horns
i
shall
miss
my
they
re
taking
the
long
road
to
i
ll
take
you
there
in
the
motor
and
send
your
mount
on
by
a
she
acquiesced
with
a
cool
shrug
which
put
him
at
once
upon
his
guard
but
doris
had
reached
a
pass
when
all
she
wanted
was
to
bring
their
relations
to
an
end
as
speedily
and
with
as
little
pain
as
possible
so
that
when
the
others
had
gone
she
sank
into
a
chair
before
the
fire
coldly
asking
him
what
he
wanted
he
stood
with
his
back
to
the
hearth
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
in
a
long
moment
of
silence
as
though
trying
to
find
the
words
to
begin
well
she
asked
insolently
what
has
happened
since
last
night
to
change
you
so
doris
i
ve
had
a
chance
to
of
what
that
it
was
time
you
and
i
had
an
i
don
t
see
wait
she
commanded
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
there
isn
t
anything
that
you
can
say
that
will
make
me
change
my
mind
therefore
the
sooner
this
talk
is
over
the
better
for
both
of
us
i
ve
told
you
and
you
know
already
that
my
whole
soul
is
wrapped
in
the
cause
of
england
in
this
war
i
can
have
nothing
but
pity
and
contempt
for
any
englishman
she
paused
for
at
this
moment
the
parlor
maid
appeared
and
gathering
up
some
brasses
on
lady
heathcote
s
desk
went
out
of
the
room
i
beg
that
you
will
be
more
careful
doris
cyril
whispered
she
was
silent
a
moment
and
then
after
a
glance
at
the
door
went
on
with
more
restraint
pity
and
contempt
are
hardly
the
kind
of
ingredients
that
love
can
live
on
they
ve
poisoned
mine
it
s
dead
i
don
t
want
to
see
you
again
she
finished
coldly
ever
i
hope
you
he
bowed
his
head
and
for
a
moment
made
no
reply
i
asked
he
said
slowly
i
hoped
that
you
would
be
willin
to
trust
me
that
you
d
wait
until
i
was
able
to
speak
to
you
to
explain
the
the
things
you
do
not
unfortunately
she
put
in
distinctly
there
is
nothing
that
i
do
not
understand
i
know
god
help
you
what
you
are
i
have
done
what
i
can
to
save
you
from
the
fate
you
re
courting
and
i
shall
still
do
so
for
the
sake
of
of
what
once
was
was
between
us
but
i
do
not
want
to
see
you
again
i
have
put
you
out
of
my
life
completely
as
though
you
never
had
been
in
it
and
now
she
rose
will
you
let
me
go
one
moment
please
he
said
calmly
you
found
those
papers
last
night
yes
she
said
coolly
and
if
i
did
he
seemed
to
breathe
more
freely
i
have
nothing
to
say
he
muttered
oh
she
said
quickly
i
m
glad
of
that
you
don
t
deny
i
deny
nothing
he
said
with
a
shrug
i
see
that
it
would
be
i
m
glad
you
give
me
credit
for
that
much
intelligence
she
said
scathingly
you
haven
t
done
so
it
was
not
your
intelligence
he
said
gently
so
much
as
your
heart
that
i
had
relied
oh
you
thought
i
was
a
fool
that
you
could
use
indefinitely
no
i
thought
you
were
a
woman
that
i
could
count
on
something
in
the
tone
of
his
own
voice
made
her
turn
and
look
at
him
a
woman
yes
but
not
an
enemy
of
he
was
silent
again
and
when
he
spoke
it
was
not
to
argue
his
voice
was
subdued
shamed
even
it
seemed
and
now
i
suppose
you
will
give
the
the
papers
to
sandys
he
said
she
examined
him
closely
and
pity
for
him
seemed
even
stronger
than
shame
it
is
a
part
of
our
misunderstanding
she
said
coolly
that
you
should
think
so
little
of
me
i
have
told
you
that
i
shall
protect
you
my
hands
shall
be
clean
if
my
heart
isn
what
will
you
do
with
the
papers
he
asked
this
and
she
turned
toward
him
burn
she
put
her
hand
into
her
pocket
drew
out
the
papers
and
went
toward
the
hearth
her
hand
was
even
extended
toward
the
fire
when
with
a
quick
movement
he
snatched
the
yellow
packet
from
her
fingers
she
fell
away
from
him
in
dismay
as
if
she
had
been
touched
by
something
poisonous
touching
her
wrist
and
the
fingers
into
which
her
rings
had
been
driven
then
she
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
and
closed
her
eyes
oh
she
gasped
you
d
pay
my
generosity
with
he
had
examined
the
papers
coolly
and
had
put
them
into
his
pocket
i
i
don
t
count
in
a
game
like
this
nor
do
you
i
m
sorry
they
were
mine
you
took
them
i
had
to
have
then
she
stammered
was
what
you
kept
me
here
for
i
had
to
have
them
he
repeated
dully
that
was
all
her
wrist
and
fingers
burned
where
he
had
hurt
them
a
brute
a
coward
as
well
as
a
traitor
she
straightened
proudly
and
with
a
look
at
his
bowed
head
she
went
by
him
and
out
of
the
room
hammersley
stood
as
she
had
left
him
for
a
moment
and
only
raised
his
head
when
the
parlor
maid
came
in
again
and
replaced
the
brasses
on
lady
heathcote
s
desk
in
his
eyes
there
came
a
keen
look
and
he
took
a
step
forward
do
you
always
clean
lady
heathcote
s
brasses
on
friday
he
asked
the
maid
she
turned
around
with
a
startled
air
oh
yes
sir
she
replied
demurely
friday
oh
said
hammersley
she
stood
a
moment
as
if
awaiting
further
questions
and
then
went
out
hammersley
followed
her
with
his
gaze
and
then
with
a
last
look
around
the
room
went
into
the
hall
put
on
his
fur
coat
and
cap
and
quickly
made
his
way
toward
the
garage
upstairs
doris
paced
her
room
in
an
agony
of
rage
and
humiliation
she
had
meant
to
give
him
his
dismissal
kindly
but
it
was
his
abjectness
that
had
made
her
scornful
abjectness
worn
as
she
now
knew
with
an
object
that
was
indifferent
to
scorn
it
was
only
with
the
purpose
of
getting
the
papers
from
her
that
he
had
kept
her
there
and
the
contempt
that
she
had
shown
for
him
seemed
but
a
piteous
thing
beside
the
enormity
of
his
brutality
he
had
not
cared
what
she
thought
of
him
he
had
not
cared
he
had
said
so
himself
their
love
was
a
trifle
beside
the
greater
matter
that
concerned
him
he
had
led
her
on
under
the
guise
of
a
shame
he
did
not
feel
from
one
revelation
to
another
playing
upon
her
emotions
upon
things
which
should
have
been
sacred
even
to
him
in
such
an
hour
until
with
infinite
cunning
he
had
made
her
bring
out
the
papers
and
then
rage
possessed
her
she
felt
that
she
had
been
tricked
with
weapons
that
he
should
have
scorned
to
use
she
hated
him
at
that
moment
not
as
she
hated
the
secrecy
and
dishonor
of
his
cause
but
as
a
man
who
could
take
advantage
of
a
woman
as
a
hypocrite
a
coward
a
bully
she
knew
the
fury
of
dido
but
she
felt
the
pain
of
ariadne
too
she
heard
the
sound
of
his
roadster
and
ran
to
the
window
peering
through
the
muslin
curtains
and
saw
him
go
by
under
her
windows
low
down
in
his
seat
his
gaze
fixed
on
the
road
ahead
driving
fast
stryker
beside
him
he
passed
without
even
a
glance
upward
or
back
out
of
her
life
it
seemed
to
her
that
if
he
had
turned
his
head
just
then
and
given
one
look
at
the
house
even
she
could
have
forgiven
him
much
but
she
watched
him
until
he
turned
the
angle
of
the
road
and
was
gone
their
interview
had
seemed
so
brief
in
all
it
seemed
scarcely
more
than
a
moment
to
have
made
such
a
horrible
change
in
her
way
of
looking
at
things
if
he
had
protested
innocence
fought
if
even
so
weakly
against
her
evidence
fought
with
a
man
s
strength
against
odds
the
danger
of
losing
the
woman
he
wanted
she
could
have
seen
him
go
with
a
calmness
born
of
woman
s
inherent
right
to
dismiss
but
this
death
surely
was
no
worse
than
for
a
woman
to
be
spurned
by
such
a
man
after
a
while
tears
came
and
they
helped
her
tears
of
anger
if
you
will
but
tears
soft
and
humid
in
which
to
a
woman
there
is
always
a
kind
of
bitter
sweetness
too
she
threw
herself
on
her
bed
in
her
riding
togs
her
mannish
coat
and
mannish
boots
eloquent
of
their
own
pretensions
in
spite
of
them
and
the
things
they
typified
she
was
merely
a
very
tired
little
girl
weeping
her
heart
out
as
other
little
girls
had
done
before
and
will
again
because
her
lover
had
gone
away
from
her
toward
luncheon
time
when
the
others
were
expected
to
return
she
got
up
bathed
her
eyes
and
summoning
wilson
changed
into
a
dress
for
the
afternoon
pride
came
to
her
rescue
now
and
with
the
help
of
her
maid
and
the
mysterious
process
with
which
maids
are
familiar
she
managed
to
make
herself
presentable
enough
to
avoid
notice
from
so
keen
an
observer
as
her
hostess
doris
found
herself
smiling
and
doing
her
share
of
conversation
in
a
mechanical
way
which
left
a
question
in
her
mind
as
to
the
depth
of
her
own
emotions
but
the
weight
about
her
heart
the
dull
echo
of
reiterated
thoughts
pervaded
all
and
she
knew
that
it
was
merely
that
her
spirit
was
dulled
her
heart
numb
like
a
nerve
from
the
shock
of
a
blow
she
stole
away
when
she
could
with
a
book
to
the
where
she
could
sit
alone
and
try
to
put
her
thoughts
in
order
chapter
ix
the
viking
s
tower
there
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
the
butler
brought
her
a
note
for
a
moment
before
she
read
the
superscription
a
wild
rush
of
something
which
might
have
been
joy
yet
could
not
be
sent
a
pale
flush
of
color
into
her
cheek
but
she
glanced
at
the
envelope
carelessly
and
when
the
man
had
gone
quickly
opened
it
it
was
from
john
rizzio
signed
with
the
familiar
initials
and
begun
without
either
name
or
qualification
you
will
think
it
strange
perhaps
that
i
should
write
to
you
after
the
events
of
last
night
because
the
modesty
of
a
woman
is
the
last
thing
that
forgives
my
action
is
beyond
apology
and
i
offer
none
for
fear
that
it
may
be
construed
into
a
hope
a
selfish
hope
of
an
unimaginable
forgiveness
hope
has
passed
that
with
the
others
but
something
else
remains
something
less
selfish
than
hope
and
more
vital
than
and
that
is
a
wish
that
your
honor
may
be
kept
free
from
the
taint
of
the
dark
and
furtive
things
with
which
it
has
come
into
contact
i
am
not
a
man
as
you
know
to
boast
of
disinterestedness
i
have
lived
a
life
in
which
my
own
affairs
were
always
paramount
my
own
aims
always
most
important
i
am
telling
you
this
to
warn
you
that
my
generosity
to
hammersley
is
not
actuated
by
any
love
of
a
man
who
has
spoiled
my
dearest
ambition
but
by
the
continued
esteem
with
which
i
still
regard
yourself
i
do
not
love
him
and
my
own
wish
my
duty
my
own
honor
my
loyalty
to
england
all
acclaim
that
he
should
be
delivered
at
once
to
those
in
authority
and
yet
i
have
refrained
for
you
doris
but
i
have
learned
that
h
is
in
communication
with
g
and
that
crenshaw
of
scotland
yard
is
on
the
alert
i
may
not
be
able
to
save
him
this
is
an
appeal
to
the
one
person
who
has
the
most
influence
with
him
and
i
ask
that
you
use
whatever
power
over
him
you
possess
to
bring
him
to
a
sense
of
the
impossibility
of
his
mad
plans
if
you
still
have
doubt
as
to
the
character
of
the
work
he
has
undertaken
i
ask
that
you
go
to
tonight
and
listen
secretly
to
convincing
proof
of
what
he
is
for
tonight
at
one
o
clock
on
the
cliffs
near
the
old
viking
s
tower
he
will
meet
a
personal
messenger
from
g
i
appeal
to
you
for
england
but
more
than
for
england
for
yourself
yours
doris
read
the
note
through
again
and
again
her
thoughts
blurring
unpleasantly
like
a
photograph
out
of
focus
it
seemed
impossible
that
she
could
do
what
he
asked
of
her
every
instinct
wounded
and
sore
from
her
last
encounter
revolted
at
the
thought
of
meeting
cyril
again
under
the
conditions
presented
it
was
impossible
that
she
should
go
cyril
would
only
laugh
at
her
or
what
would
be
worse
show
her
the
callousness
and
brutality
that
he
had
done
this
morning
rizzio
asked
her
to
do
what
she
could
why
should
she
save
him
what
had
he
done
to
merit
such
a
sacrifice
of
pride
on
her
part
the
past
that
was
dead
and
cyril
buried
with
it
england
she
put
her
head
forward
into
her
hands
and
pressed
her
fingers
to
her
temples
england
as
the
afternoon
faded
into
night
the
conviction
grew
in
doris
s
mind
that
the
situation
made
personal
considerations
unimportant
after
dinner
she
excused
herself
and
dressing
warmly
toward
twelve
o
clock
went
downstairs
past
the
library
door
and
out
to
the
stables
she
found
a
sleepy
groom
and
giving
him
a
liberal
fee
as
the
price
of
his
silence
had
a
put
on
a
good
horse
and
made
her
way
in
the
direction
of
she
knew
the
road
well
for
she
had
traveled
it
many
times
with
cyril
and
betty
during
the
previous
summer
when
all
the
world
was
gay
and
she
and
cyril
were
lovers
she
was
a
little
nervous
at
being
alone
on
the
moor
in
the
darkness
but
not
frightened
she
gave
herself
greater
hardihood
by
trying
to
remember
that
cyril
and
rizzio
were
gentlemen
one
of
whom
she
had
thought
she
could
have
trusted
with
her
life
the
other
a
friend
who
wanted
to
be
trusted
with
it
and
now
protested
he
held
her
honor
dearer
than
his
own
not
her
enemies
surely
and
the
thought
of
physical
harm
from
either
of
them
the
only
thing
that
could
have
deterred
her
from
this
midnight
venture
did
not
occur
to
her
but
as
she
came
to
saltham
rocks
the
scene
of
cyril
s
last
night
s
encounter
she
pressed
forward
more
rapidly
with
a
keen
eye
upon
the
gray
blur
of
the
road
she
reached
the
her
breath
coming
a
little
more
rapidly
pulled
her
horse
down
to
a
walk
and
turned
in
upon
cyril
s
property
going
forward
more
slowly
until
the
present
moment
she
had
formulated
no
plan
of
action
nor
had
counted
upon
the
possibilities
of
discovery
so
she
rode
cautiously
making
a
long
detour
across
the
moor
to
avoid
the
lights
of
one
of
the
keepers
houses
which
stood
upon
the
road
she
found
that
she
had
to
choose
her
way
among
the
rocks
and
whins
but
her
horse
was
and
at
a
walk
there
was
little
danger
of
a
cropper
she
kept
the
road
in
sight
and
by
the
fitful
light
of
the
stars
between
the
rack
of
mist
and
clouds
that
were
coming
in
from
the
sea
she
made
her
way
in
the
general
direction
of
the
lodge
on
her
right
she
had
glimpses
of
the
sea
beyond
the
cliffs
and
heard
the
pounding
of
the
surf
upon
the
rocks
and
shingle
the
viking
s
tower
was
up
among
the
rocks
near
beaufort
head
half
a
mile
beyond
the
house
she
had
been
there
with
cyril
many
times
and
from
the
ruined
wall
had
sat
with
him
and
looked
out
over
the
north
sea
while
he
had
told
her
in
his
sportive
vernacular
the
story
of
the
tower
and
of
the
johnnies
who
had
built
it
it
was
difficult
to
identify
that
cyril
now
with
the
man
of
mystery
lurking
out
here
somewhere
in
the
dark
his
mind
set
on
the
odious
business
of
betraying
his
country
the
lodge
was
set
inland
from
the
sea
in
a
valley
between
two
ridges
which
narrowed
down
to
a
fissure
in
the
rocks
that
fell
away
to
beaufort
cove
a
small
harbor
almost
where
cyril
kept
his
and
sloop
as
the
girl
approached
the
lodge
she
turned
far
to
the
left
and
made
a
wide
circle
among
the
hills
so
that
there
could
be
no
chance
of
inquisitive
eyes
discovering
the
bold
silhouette
of
her
horse
against
the
sky
slowly
she
climbed
the
lower
ridges
of
until
she
reached
a
level
spot
high
above
the
house
garage
stables
and
hangar
where
she
stopped
for
a
moment
to
rest
her
winded
horse
below
her
a
wild
panorama
of
land
and
sky
the
ragged
profile
of
black
rocks
etched
deep
into
the
sullen
gray
of
the
sea
seen
from
this
height
the
contours
were
unfamiliar
to
her
and
the
purpose
of
her
grim
visit
gave
the
grim
vista
a
dramatic
significance
that
was
almost
theatrical
long
lines
emerged
from
the
dark
blur
of
sea
and
sky
and
roared
in
upon
the
rocks
that
guarded
the
harbor
upon
which
they
were
shivered
into
foam
inside
the
rim
of
rocks
the
placid
cove
calmly
reflected
the
sky
she
saw
the
near
the
landing
made
out
the
specter
lines
of
cyril
s
sloop
the
and
in
the
shadow
of
the
cliffs
saw
another
vessel
the
lines
of
which
were
unfamiliar
this
craft
was
long
and
slender
with
a
wireless
mast
and
two
large
no
lights
showed
aboard
of
her
but
there
were
signs
of
activity
for
while
the
girl
looked
a
small
boat
was
lowered
and
was
pulled
for
the
landing
and
suddenly
the
real
meaning
of
this
dark
vessel
was
borne
to
her
there
was
no
mistaking
the
grim
profile
of
the
thing
that
projected
from
the
forward
superstructure
and
the
curving
decks
which
met
the
water
in
such
slender
lines
it
was
a
a
destroyer
and
the
man
who
was
putting
out
for
the
shore
was
the
german
messenger
who
was
to
meet
cyril
hammersley
at
she
trembled
and
clung
to
the
pommel
of
her
saddle
the
brief
joyous
moments
that
had
come
to
her
at
intervals
during
the
evening
as
she
thought
of
the
inflections
of
cyril
s
voice
of
the
weary
look
she
had
seen
in
his
eyes
and
hoped
that
even
tonight
he
might
be
able
to
justify
himself
in
her
own
thoughts
at
least
were
engulfed
in
the
damning
conviction
of
what
she
saw
before
her
john
rizzio
had
told
her
the
truth
how
he
had
learned
what
was
to
happen
she
did
not
know
or
care
but
the
accuracy
of
his
information
was
no
longer
a
matter
to
doubt
she
looked
around
her
in
the
darkness
toward
the
way
by
which
she
had
come
really
frightened
for
the
first
time
that
evening
as
at
the
palpable
presence
of
sin
for
a
moment
she
hesitated
in
her
intention
to
go
forward
she
had
seen
enough
to
convince
her
there
was
no
need
of
more
but
the
real
object
of
her
mission
nerved
her
to
her
task
she
must
go
on
at
once
if
she
wished
to
reach
the
tower
in
time
to
conceal
herself
so
she
pressed
her
horse
along
the
hill
and
when
she
had
crossed
the
ridge
rode
down
in
a
path
parallel
to
the
edge
of
the
cliffs
which
brought
her
after
a
while
into
a
line
with
beaufort
head
where
she
could
see
the
dim
mass
of
the
ruin
rising
above
the
chaos
of
rock
that
surrounded
it
when
she
reached
a
spot
not
too
far
distant
she
dismounted
in
a
clump
of
bushes
and
fastening
the
bridle
of
her
horse
to
the
gnarled
limb
of
a
stunted
tree
crept
forward
on
foot
the
excitement
of
the
venture
and
its
possible
consequences
now
gave
her
renewed
strength
and
caution
moving
to
the
left
toward
the
northern
side
of
the
tower
she
clambered
over
the
rocks
toward
the
sea
there
should
be
plenty
of
time
to
reach
a
place
of
concealment
before
the
occupant
of
the
boat
had
time
to
climb
the
steep
and
tortuous
path
from
the
landing
and
peering
from
side
to
side
pausing
from
time
to
time
to
listen
she
reached
the
shadow
of
table
rock
a
huge
slab
of
granite
which
had
been
tossed
by
some
convulsion
of
nature
upon
the
very
summit
of
the
head
the
physical
contours
of
the
place
made
her
approach
an
easy
one
for
the
cliffs
were
strewn
with
bowlders
and
it
was
easy
to
slip
from
one
to
another
without
detection
assured
that
the
spot
that
she
had
reached
was
as
near
the
tower
as
she
dared
approach
for
the
present
she
wedged
herself
into
a
crevice
between
two
rocks
into
which
she
might
pass
and
go
out
by
the
other
side
and
sank
down
upon
her
knees
and
waited
the
moments
passed
slowly
where
was
john
rizzio
would
cyril
never
come
she
had
a
moment
of
horror
in
the
thought
that
the
german
messenger
might
come
and
discover
her
before
cyril
arrived
what
would
he
do
to
her
kill
her
of
course
and
in
a
panic
of
sinking
nerves
she
thought
of
getting
to
her
feet
and
fleeing
into
the
friendly
darkness
from
which
she
had
come
she
had
even
risen
and
her
head
was
just
below
the
level
of
the
top
of
her
refuge
when
she
heard
footsteps
close
by
and
got
the
odor
of
a
cigarette
so
she
sank
back
her
hand
at
her
heart
to
quiet
its
throbbings
the
footsteps
passed
her
returned
and
then
went
toward
the
tower
and
she
bared
her
head
and
peered
cautiously
out
a
tall
figure
in
a
long
coat
and
cap
was
standing
watching
the
path
to
the
landing
she
could
not
see
his
features
but
she
knew
that
it
was
cyril
for
one
moment
she
thought
of
running
to
him
and
throwing
herself
at
his
feet
and
pleading
with
him
while
there
was
still
time
to
go
away
into
the
darkness
with
her
anywhere
before
this
stranger
should
reach
him
but
her
courage
failed
her
and
she
sank
back
into
her
corner
and
when
she
straightened
again
her
moment
had
passed
for
she
heard
other
footsteps
to
her
right
of
a
man
as
he
clambered
up
the
rocks
he
passed
quite
near
her
a
burly
man
in
a
naval
cap
and
coat
out
of
breath
from
his
exertions
cyril
came
forward
to
meet
him
and
she
heard
the
short
words
of
their
greeting
herr
hammersley
she
peered
out
and
saw
the
burly
man
straighten
his
heels
together
and
touch
his
fingers
to
the
rim
of
his
cap
cyril
bowed
and
asked
a
question
and
the
other
replied
in
a
sentence
that
contained
the
word
which
was
the
only
word
she
understood
she
crept
a
little
closer
so
that
she
could
hear
more
distinctly
hoping
that
her
slight
knowledge
of
german
might
aid
her
she
watched
cyril
to
see
if
he
passed
anything
to
the
german
officer
instead
of
this
the
german
took
a
letter
from
an
inside
pocket
and
handed
it
to
cyril
and
she
heard
the
words
again
and
a
message
it
seemed
from
some
prince
or
from
some
general
or
high
official
of
the
german
government
cyril
appeared
to
offer
apologies
and
broke
the
seal
of
the
envelope
bringing
from
the
pocket
of
his
overcoat
an
electric
torch
by
the
aid
of
which
he
read
the
letter
doris
could
see
his
face
quite
plainly
in
the
reflected
light
from
the
page
and
marked
the
deep
lines
at
his
brows
and
the
stern
look
at
his
mouth
and
chin
he
went
over
the
document
twice
very
carefully
and
then
as
he
turned
to
his
companion
she
heard
his
voice
saying
quite
distinctly
in
german
you
know
the
purport
of
this
paper
no
herr
hammersley
said
the
officer
my
orders
are
merely
to
deliver
this
letter
which
was
to
receive
your
cyril
paused
for
a
long
moment
tapping
the
document
lightly
with
his
finger
and
then
taking
a
pencil
from
his
pocket
bent
over
and
upon
the
nearest
rock
wrote
something
then
he
slipped
the
letter
into
its
envelope
and
handed
it
to
the
other
who
put
it
into
his
pocket
saluted
again
and
with
a
hurried
farewell
turned
down
the
path
and
was
gone
that
was
all
the
interview
had
not
lasted
more
than
five
minutes
but
doris
knew
by
the
look
she
had
seen
on
cyril
s
face
that
danger
threatened
the
letter
had
contained
a
command
a
command
from
a
german
officer
of
high
rank
to
cyril
hammersley
a
spy
receiving
his
orders
from
the
government
he
served
if
he
had
gone
back
to
the
lodge
at
this
moment
she
would
have
let
him
go
past
her
without
a
word
for
the
bitterness
came
back
into
her
heart
and
engulfed
all
purpose
she
sat
in
her
place
of
concealment
peering
out
at
him
fascinated
he
moved
nearer
and
then
stood
his
feet
braced
on
the
rocks
gazing
down
the
path
by
which
his
midnight
visitor
had
disappeared
how
long
he
stood
there
motionless
she
could
not
know
but
as
the
moments
passed
and
he
did
not
move
she
rose
from
her
cranny
her
trembling
nerves
seeking
an
outlet
in
motion
or
speech
why
didn
t
he
move
at
last
her
overtaxed
nerves
could
no
longer
endure
and
she
came
out
of
the
shadow
and
spoke
his
name
still
he
made
no
motion
and
she
realized
that
her
lips
had
made
no
sound
but
her
foot
touched
a
small
stone
which
fell
among
the
rocks
and
she
saw
him
wheel
around
and
face
her
quickly
something
glittering
in
his
hand
while
his
voice
rang
sharply
stand
where
you
are
he
took
a
few
threatening
steps
toward
her
his
look
studying
her
small
bulk
it
s
i
cyril
she
said
faintly
you
he
glanced
to
right
and
left
putting
the
thing
in
his
pocket
and
faced
her
incredulous
what
are
you
doing
here
doris
i
came
to
to
see
you
again
his
eyes
were
still
searching
the
darkness
around
them
who
told
you
to
come
here
no
one
she
lied
i
followed
who
saw
you
come
you
heard
yes
slowly
o
cyril
i
can
t
let
you
go
from
me
like
this
she
put
her
face
to
her
hands
and
felt
his
arms
enfold
her
she
trembled
but
in
this
weakness
a
new
kind
of
strength
came
to
her
i
want
you
to
come
with
me
away
away
from
all
this
for
me
for
england
it
s
my
last
appeal
you
must
not
refuse
it
i
i
want
you
so
cyril
as
it
used
to
she
felt
his
lips
gently
touch
her
brow
and
heard
his
whisper
god
bless
you
she
clung
to
him
desperately
to
his
caress
the
one
sure
symbol
of
his
purity
i
love
you
cyril
she
murmured
i
can
t
help
it
i
ve
tried
not
to
but
you
couldn
t
kiss
me
like
this
reverently
if
you
did
not
love
me
well
enough
to
forget
everything
else
say
you
do
i
love
you
he
whispered
again
but
you
must
not
stay
here
you
must
doesn
t
it
mean
something
to
you
that
i
came
she
went
on
breathlessly
that
i
could
forget
what
happened
that
the
love
that
was
in
my
heart
for
you
was
greater
than
my
hatred
of
what
you
are
i
came
so
that
you
could
know
it
by
the
difficulty
the
danger
that
i
ran
i
don
t
care
what
others
may
think
of
me
the
only
thing
that
matters
is
to
have
you
again
you
don
t
know
what
it
cost
me
to
come
i
am
not
the
kind
to
be
held
so
lightly
cyril
i
have
forgotten
my
pride
even
my
sense
of
what
is
fitting
for
a
girl
to
do
in
the
hope
that
you
will
listen
to
yes
he
murmured
but
not
now
doris
you
must
go
not
yet
she
protested
i
i
have
much
to
do
he
said
that
messenger
o
cyril
you
mustn
t
come
back
with
me
tonight
now
i
can
t
he
muttered
it
it
is
important
for
me
to
stay
here
she
loosened
his
arms
and
stood
away
from
him
peering
down
into
the
cove
where
clouds
of
black
smoke
were
belching
from
the
funnels
of
the
black
vessel
the
water
of
the
cove
was
churning
in
its
wake
and
its
prow
was
turning
toward
the
harbor
mouth
suddenly
she
saw
cyril
start
and
peer
around
him
in
the
darkness
who
sent
you
here
she
heard
his
voice
in
a
strangled
whisper
at
her
ear
no
one
she
denied
again
i
followed
that
isn
t
possible
doris
he
said
quickly
i
have
reasons
for
knowing
you
were
here
before
i
came
rizzio
told
you
he
knew
what
was
to
happen
he
was
the
only
one
who
could
have
why
her
curiosity
sent
all
subterfuge
flying
she
could
see
his
pale
face
in
the
moonlight
because
it
was
rizzio
who
sent
this
messenger
to
meet
rizzio
the
mystery
was
deepening
i
can
t
he
hesitated
a
long
moment
before
replying
as
though
weighing
something
in
his
mind
i
ll
tell
you
this
much
he
said
at
last
you
ve
a
right
to
know
rizzio
told
you
that
he
was
an
agent
of
the
english
government
it
s
my
word
against
his
you
can
believe
me
or
not
if
you
like
rizzio
is
a
spy
of
germany
impossible
john
rizzio
she
whispered
aghast
he
laughed
the
pot
callin
the
kettle
black
what
it
s
the
but
rizzio
what
object
would
he
have
in
betraying
england
a
man
of
his
position
that
s
the
kind
of
men
england
s
enemies
want
put
in
cyril
dryly
but
he
has
no
need
of
money
not
money
impossible
no
not
money
there
are
other
things
that
john
rizzio
values
more
than
what
he
caught
her
by
the
arm
impressively
to
make
his
meaning
clear
you
don
t
know
the
passion
of
collectors
they
would
sell
their
souls
for
the
things
they
want
the
things
that
seem
impossible
are
the
things
they
want
the
but
i
don
t
after
the
war
rizzio
is
to
be
permitted
to
buy
rubens
s
descent
from
the
cross
from
the
german
oh
she
gasped
in
horror
a
new
idea
of
the
terrible
possibilities
of
duplicity
was
borne
to
her
but
she
couldn
t
believe
how
do
you
know
this
she
asked
he
laughed
it
s
one
of
the
things
i
stopped
in
london
to
find
then
you
i
am
a
german
i
don
t
believe
you
she
cried
proudly
there
was
a
note
of
joy
in
her
voice
a
momentary
note
which
seemed
to
trail
off
into
one
of
terror
cyril
she
whispered
rizzio
he
wrote
me
to
come
i
knew
but
he
said
he
she
hesitated
why
did
he
want
me
to
come
there
must
have
been
some
other
reasons
besides
wanting
me
to
see
he
s
here
cyril
somewhere
hammersley
started
and
turned
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
doris
followed
his
look
three
men
had
risen
from
among
the
rocks
toward
the
tower
don
t
move
hammersley
said
rizzio
s
voice
you
re
in
danger
but
the
girl
was
clinging
to
cyril
s
arm
no
no
she
was
crying
several
shots
rang
out
as
cyril
threw
her
aside
dashing
forward
one
of
the
men
seemed
to
stumble
among
the
rocks
and
fall
heavily
the
other
came
in
toward
cyril
his
arm
raised
but
another
shot
from
behind
the
rocks
made
him
pause
twist
half
around
his
hand
to
his
shoulder
as
cyril
caught
him
a
blow
which
sent
him
reeling
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
over
which
he
hung
for
a
moment
peering
downwards
in
horror
and
then
disappeared
from
view
well
done
stryker
she
heard
cyril
cry
the
other
this
way
don
t
let
him
get
and
stryker
disappeared
after
rizzio
chapter
x
the
yellow
dove
in
a
daze
doris
saw
cyril
bend
over
the
prostrate
figure
and
then
come
toward
her
dead
she
whispered
in
horror
but
he
didn
t
seem
to
hear
her
he
caught
her
by
the
arm
and
forcibly
led
her
inland
dead
she
whispered
again
it
might
have
been
or
you
she
heard
him
say
sharply
me
yes
but
it
s
my
fault
i
should
have
john
rizzio
would
kill
oh
it
s
unbelievable
you
know
too
he
gave
a
short
laugh
far
too
much
for
your
own
good
or
he
caught
her
suddenly
by
both
arms
and
made
her
look
straight
into
his
eyes
doris
you
ve
seen
nothing
you
ve
heard

his
grasp

her
but
she
bore
it
without
a
murmur

said

yes
faintly

blindly
where

pleaded

horse
and
untied
the
bridle

doris
and
if
you
love
me
he
gave
her
a
lift
into
the
saddle
and
kissed
her
hand
then
he
looked
around
him
and
gave
a
parting
injunction
now
cut
sharp
off
to
the
right
in
the
darkness
until
you
strike
the
old
sheep
trail
you
can
see
it
quite
plainly
in
the
heather
follow
it
to
the
head
of
the
ridge
then
take
the
road
to
horsham
hill
and
god
bless
a
sob
rose
in
her
throat
and
she
could
only
wave
a
hand
in
reply
and
so
she
left
him
standing
there
alone
gazing
after
her
with
bared
head
in
the
darkness
the
strain
on
her
nerves
had
told
on
her
and
she
sat
her
listlessly
holding
on
by
the
pommel
and
peering
into
the
darkness
before
her
with
eyes
that
saw
nothing
but
pictures
of
death
she
could
not
forget
the
wounded
man
grasping
at
space
as
he
tottered
on
the
rim
of
the
rocks
cyril
had
killed
a
man
war
she
had
thought
war
a
more
glorious
thing
this
seemed
very
like
murder
she
blessed
god
for
stryker
who
had
come
so
opportunely
rizzio
had
tried
to
kill
cyril
in
horror
she
had
seen
him
raise
his
pistol
and
aim
but
at
her
cry
he
had
missed
his
shot
and
with
the
disabling
of
his
confederates
he
had
fled
rizzio
was
a
german
spy
then
since
they
were
enemies
of
course
cyril
was
loyal
playing
a
part
to
deceive
the
enemy
learning
its
secrets
that
england
might
profit
by
them
the
message
what
was
the
message
that
the
german
naval
officer
had
brought
which
had
so
disturbed
cyril
what
was
this
mysterious
duty
of
cyril
s
which
meant
so
much
to
his
cause
the
success
or
failure
of
which
hung
by
a
thread
she
tried
to
think
what
cyril
could
do
in
england
and
after
a
time
the
thing
began
to
come
to
her
cyril
was
acting
for
england
he
had
succeeded
in
the
guise
of
a
german
secret
agent
in
finding
the
traitor
in
the
war
office
and
it
was
cyril
who
had
caused
the
arrest
of
captain
byfield
rizzio
too
was
a
german
spy
who
for
some
reason
or
other
had
been
sent
o
god
that
was
it
the
germans
suspected
cyril
and
had
used
john
rizzio
to
put
him
to
the
test
had
set
a
thief
to
catch
a
thief
cyril
had
found
that
the
message
was
a
dangerous
one
and
had
refused
to
give
it
up
to
rizzio
that
seemed
to
explain
everything
cyril
s
willingness
to
have
her
burn
the
papers
rizzio
s
anxiety
to
save
them
that
he
might
send
them
to
his
employers
the
second
packet
of
papers
a
false
message
prepared
for
a
purpose
which
cyril
was
to
fulfill
the
german
naval
officer
his
message
what
was
it
imagination
refused
to
aid
her
she
could
not
understand
he
brought
a
command
a
test
of
cyril
s
loyalty
to
germany
perhaps
was
that
it
and
if
so
what
a
test
which
meant
victory
or
defeat
that
was
what
cyril
s
last
words
had
meant
victory
or
defeat
life
or
death
it
was
a
desperate
game
that
he
was
playing
and
what
was
he
going
to
do
tonight
that
made
it
necessary
for
him
to
leave
her
to
ride
to
kilmorack
house
alone
bewildered
and
weary
with
excitement
and
much
thinking
she
gave
it
up
and
as
in
a
daze
set
her
mind
to
the
task
of
finding
the
way
to
horsham
hill
she
rode
on
inland
searching
for
the
old
sheep
trail
as
cyril
had
described
it
to
her
but
as
the
minutes
went
by
and
she
did
not
find
it
she
began
to
think
that
she
must
have
passed
it
in
the
darkness
she
had
ridden
at
a
walk
for
hours
it
seemed
keeping
as
she
thought
in
a
direction
which
would
surely
lead
her
to
a
road
toward
the
hill
but
she
realized
now
that
she
was
lost
on
the
moor
and
that
it
might
be
morning
before
she
would
find
her
way
to
betty
heathcote
s
she
stopped
her
horse
and
peered
in
every
direction
nothing
but
the
undulations
of
the
moor
hill
and
dale
a
dead
tree
outlined
against
the
sky
masses
of
rock
uncouth
in
form
bushes
which
whispered
in
the
wind
the
babble
of
a
tarn
somewhere
behind
her
though
she
had
not
remembered
passing
it
there
were
no
lights
in
any
direction
none
even
from
the
heavens
for
the
stars
had
gone
out
after
a
long
while
she
wondered
vaguely
what
time
it
was
she
had
no
watch
but
it
seemed
that
a
paleness
like
that
which
precedes
the
dawn
had
spread
along
the
sky
though
it
hardly
seemed
possible
it
could
be
so
late
as
that
three
four
o
clock
she
thought
it
might
be
perhaps
later
the
one
thing
that
now
seemed
to
persist
in
her
mind
was
the
hope
that
wilson
had
obeyed
orders
and
kept
lady
heathcote
in
ignorance
of
her
absence
she
was
startled
by
her
horse
which
without
moving
had
stretched
his
neck
and
whinnied
loudly
he
too
had
realized
the
aimlessness
of
their
wanderings
and
wanted
the
warm
stalls
at
the
kilmorack
stables
doris
tried
to
think
what
was
best
to
do
all
sense
of
direction
was
gone
and
she
was
beyond
even
the
sound
of
the
sea
at
last
she
decided
to
try
a
slight
eminence
and
see
if
she
could
make
out
the
bulk
of
but
a
mist
had
fallen
and
when
she
reached
the
height
she
was
no
wiser
than
before
fortunately
it
was
not
cold
and
if
she
did
not
fall
from
the
saddle
in
utter
weariness
daylight
would
show
her
a
way
she
got
down
from
her
horse
and
fastening
him
to
a
bush
walked
to
and
fro
to
keep
awake
waiting
for
the
day
for
at
sunrise
she
could
make
her
way
toward
the
east
until
she
reached
the
coast
after
which
by
following
the
cliffs
to
the
right
she
would
reach
the
lodge
and
from
there
the
way
to
kilmorack
house
she
had
grown
accustomed
to
the
silences
and
now
and
then
paused
in
her
pacing
to
stop
and
listen
she
thought
she
heard
a
sound
different
from
the
others
behind
her
it
seemed
a
subdued
murmur
which
as
she
listened
grew
in
intensity
until
she
clearly
made
it
out
to
be
the
quick
reverberations
of
a
motor
running
with
its
open
it
was
coming
fast
and
in
a
moment
a
long
fan
of
light
shot
across
the
sky
from
below
the
brow
of
a
distant
hill
and
then
fell
suddenly
to
earth
where
it
picked
out
the
shapes
of
trees
and
bushes
along
what
appeared
to
be
its
road
the
motor
was
not
traveling
toward
her
but
at
an
angle
which
would
make
it
pass
near
her
but
quickly
as
she
mounted
and
rode
toward
it
she
was
unable
even
to
come
within
earshot
before
the
machine
had
passed
and
was
lost
to
sight
in
the
distance
it
had
not
gone
by
so
rapidly
that
doris
had
not
been
able
to
make
out
on
a
rise
of
ground
against
the
sky
the
profile
of
a
roadster
and
the
shapes
of
two
men
cyril
and
stryker
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
it
for
the
body
of
cyril
s
car
was
familiar
to
her
and
the
chances
of
any
other
machine
being
abroad
in
this
locality
at
this
hour
were
remote
indeed
where
were
they
going
in
which
direction
toward
saltham
rocks
or
northward
she
did
not
know
but
decided
to
take
the
chance
and
follow
she
reached
the
road
without
difficulty
a
trail
it
appeared
to
be
with
wheel
tracks
and
the
marks
of
hoofs
she
pressed
her
horse
onward
in
the
wake
of
the
speeding
machine
not
to
overtake
it
but
to
reach
a
destination
of
some
sort
which
would
be
better
than
the
utter
loneliness
of
the
desolate
moor
the
silence
and
inaction
of
which
made
her
a
prey
to
unhappy
thoughts
her
horse
was
willing
and
as
the
going
was
good
broke
into
a
brisk
trot
which
for
a
while
kept
the
glow
of
the
swinging
searchlight
of
the
machine
in
sight
but
presently
that
too
disappeared
and
all
was
as
before
and
glancing
above
she
understood
to
her
right
a
pale
streak
of
light
was
showing
along
the
horizon
and
above
her
between
patches
of
dark
clouds
she
caught
a
faint
reflection
of
violet
light
it
was
the
beginning
of
the
dawn
dawn
on
her
right
that
meant
the
east
she
was
riding
north
then
north
and
to
what
destination
she
had
ridden
this
road
with
cyril
but
never
to
its
end
which
as
she
knew
was
among
the
unhospitable
crags
of
rudha
mor
a
wild
spot
unfrequented
by
any
except
cyril
s
gamekeepers
what
was
cyril
s
errand
in
the
night
to
such
a
place
when
everything
that
had
happened
would
seem
to
indicate
the
necessity
for
his
immediate
return
to
london
the
same
kind
of
curiosity
that
had
made
her
open
the
package
of
cigarette
papers
against
cyril
s
wishes
stimulated
her
to
follow
this
quest
to
its
end
she
forgot
that
she
had
had
no
sleep
all
night
and
little
the
night
before
of
physical
weariness
now
she
seemed
to
have
none
and
in
the
growing
light
she
urged
her
tired
horse
forward
into
a
hard
gallop
which
covered
the
miles
swiftly
she
came
to
the
cliffs
and
saw
the
sea
passed
inland
again
the
going
was
rougher
here
less
turf
and
more
rocks
and
whins
while
to
her
left
the
hills
were
split
by
crags
which
protruded
in
fantastic
shapes
like
heads
of
prisoned
monsters
of
the
underworld
which
had
forced
their
way
up
through
the
crust
of
the
earth
to
the
light
of
day
it
was
curious
the
trail
was
well
worn
here
as
it
had
been
before
and
there
were
signs
of
much
hauling
what
was
going
on
at
rudha
mor
the
place
could
not
be
far
distant
for
she
saw
that
the
road
wound
up
the
rocks
and
fell
away
rapidly
into
a
deep
gorge
the
further
side
of
which
she
could
see
dimly
colored
with
the
opalescent
tint
of
the
east
this
she
thought
must
be
nearly
the
end
of
her
ride
she
did
not
know
what
was
in
store
for
her
and
was
doubtful
as
to
her
wisdom
but
she
was
eaten
with
curiosity
and
dismounted
led
her
horse
slowly
to
the
lip
of
the
gorge
and
peered
over
what
she
saw
made
her
gasp
she
drew
quickly
back
tethered
her
horse
to
a
bush
and
came
forward
again
near
by
under
a
shed
built
on
the
brink
of
the
cliff
was
cyril
s
roadster
but
of
cyril
and
stryker
she
saw
no
sign
beneath
her
feet
the
cliffs
fell
away
rapidly
by
easy
steps
down
which
she
marked
a
footpath
the
bottom
of
the
gorge
was
of
rock
and
sand
shelving
gradually
toward
the
sea
and
fairly
in
its
middle
built
strongly
of
rough
lumber
she
saw
a
shed
with
wide
doors
which
even
now
were
open
a
large
hangar
from
which
as
she
looked
several
figures
wheeled
forth
a
huge
aÃ«roplane
to
a
platform
of
planks
which
extended
for
a
long
way
toward
the
sea
from
a
distance
it
was
difficult
to
judge
its
measurements
but
by
comparison
with
the
heights
of
the
men
doris
knew
that
she
had
never
seen
a
machine
so
large
as
the
east
grew
lighter
she
could
see
cyril
plainly
he
came
out
of
the
hangar
dressed
in
leather
gave
some
orders
which
made
the
other
figures
hurry
and
a
series
of
deafening
explosions
from
the
engine
as
they
tuned
it
up
gave
doris
a
sense
of
immediate
departure
for
a
while
she
watched
fascinated
her
interest
in
the
size
of
this
huge
toy
and
its
possibilities
making
a
separate
which
superseded
all
those
that
had
gone
before
but
as
the
light
grew
stronger
and
she
made
out
the
color
of
the
wide
yellow
planes
she
started
up
with
a
cry
which
would
have
been
heard
by
the
men
below
her
had
it
not
been
for
the
racket
that
the
engine
was
making
a
huge
machine
with
yellow
wings
she
remembered
jack
sandys
description
a
thousand
horsepower
at
the
yellow
dove
this
was
the
yellow
dove
and
the
man
of
mystery
its
driver
was
cyril
spellbound
and
trembling
with
excitement
she
watched
cyril
climb
up
into
one
of
the
seats
cyril
was
going
to
fly
to
the
germans
she
knew
it
now
to
obey
the
commands
which
had
been
brought
last
night
by
the
german
officer
commands
to
come
to
germany
and
explain
his
failure
to
deliver
his
secret
message
to
rizzio
they
suspected
him
and
yet
he
was
going
to
face
them
it
was
desperate
foolhardy
insane
he
would
never
come
back
not
victory
but
death
that
was
what
it
meant
she
ran
out
to
the
very
edge
of
the
rocks
shrieking
his
name
but
the
sounds
were
lost
in
the
fearful
din
of
the
motor
below
the
explosions
echoed
and
reÃ«choed
in
the
gorge
which
seemed
to
quiver
with
the
volume
of
sound
not
a
head
from
below
was
turned
up
to
look
at
her
and
she
had
a
sense
of
her
own
unimportance
in
the
immensity
of
cyril
s
viewpoint
she
saw
the
yellow
machine
start
slowly
down
the
incline
gathering
momentum
as
it
ran
until
it
left
the
runway
and
rose
magnificently
its
engine
roaring
steadily
clearing
the
surf
and
rocks
and
heading
straight
into
the
growing
day
o
god
that
she
should
have
suspected
him
of
anything
base
and
dishonorable
a
man
who
could
face
death
as
he
was
doing
as
he
had
been
doing
for
months
cyril
the
yellow
dove
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
it
for
she
had
seen
with
her
own
eyes
she
understood
now
many
things
that
had
been
a
mystery
before
why
he
could
not
speak
to
her
the
reasons
for
his
occasional
absences
for
his
air
of
indifference
for
his
coolness
in
the
face
of
adverse
criticism
she
understood
about
john
rizzio
and
the
reasons
why
cyril
had
wanted
her
to
take
such
precautions
in
getting
safely
back
to
ashwater
park
precautions
which
she
had
disregarded
but
what
mattered
about
her
when
cyril
every
day
every
hour
for
months
had
taken
chances
against
death
the
most
ignominious
death
of
all
her
heart
was
big
with
pride
in
him
and
she
followed
the
yellow
dove
with
her
gaze
now
rising
high
and
diminishing
rapidly
in
the
mist
her
soul
in
her
moist
eyes
and
on
her
lips
which
were
whispering
words
that
she
hoped
could
follow
him
into
the
distance
her
cyril
still
hers
and
england
s
the
honorable
cyril
whom
the

xi
von
stromberg
in
the
taunus
range
north
of
the
schwartzwald
lies
the
village
of
windenberg
on
the
slopes
of
the
hills
that
lead
by
slow
stages
to
higher
elevations
of
the
grosser
feldberg
in
the
valleys
are
vineyards
orchards
chestnut
and
and
in
times
of
peace
the
people
are
contented
and
industrious
the
schloss
of
the
counts
von
winden
stands
upon
an
eminence
and
looks
down
upon
a
rolling
country
of
velvety
woods
extending
for
miles
along
the
slope
of
the
range
in
this
region
of
firs
and
beech
trees
one
might
walk
for
miles
off
the
roads
without
coming
upon
a
sign
of
human
habitation
or
indeed
without
passing
the
boundaries
of
the
von
winden
estate
but
three
miles
from
winden
schloss
well
hidden
among
the
hills
was
a
spot
of
cleared
land
containing
perhaps
two
hundred
acres
which
had
been
once
used
by
the
von
winden
family
as
a
farm
but
had
been
taken
since
the
beginning
of
the
war
by
the
state
for
purposes
of
its
own
a
good
road
led
to
windenberg
five
miles
away
through
the
forest
but
much
secrecy
attached
to
blaufelden
as
the
place
was
called
men
of
the
imperial
forest
service
kept
guard
upon
all
the
roads
and
no
one
but
those
having
official
permission
were
allowed
to
come
within
two
miles
of
the
place
a
visit
would
have
soon
explained
the
reasons
for
this
extraordinary
care
on
the
part
of
the
men
in
uniform
for
not
far
from
the
house
and
stables
unobtrusive
buildings
of
brick
and
stone
were
aviation
sheds
a
garage
and
storage
houses
which
indicated
at
almost
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
a
military
activity
within
the
farmhouse
of
blaufelden
rather
late
in
a
night
in
march
a
tall
figure
slender
buttoned
to
the
neck
in
a
uniform
coat
paced
slowly
up
and
down
a
plain
wooden
table
stood
in
the
center
of
the
room
it
was
lighted
by
a
lamp
with
a
green
shade
and
covered
with
papers
arranged
in
orderly
piles
there
were
chairs
strongly
but
simply
made
and
a
rug
and
the
walls
were
decorated
with
pictures
of
hunting
scenes
while
over
the
stone
fireplace
in
which
the
pine
logs
intermittently
blazed
there
was
a
colored
lithograph
of
the
emperor
of
germany
it
was
the
kind
of
room
and
the
kind
of
furniture
one
would
expect
to
find
in
any
of
the
rural
districts
of
the
great
empire
with
the
one
difference
that
nowhere
was
there
visible
the
touch
of
a
woman
s
hand
whatever
its
original
purpose
the
room
at
the
present
moment
contained
only
the
essentials
of
the
barest
comfort
and
the
figure
of
the
man
in
uniform
erect
silent
and
austere
completed
the
impression
which
the
simplicity
of
his
surroundings
created
order
cleanliness
efficiency
expressed
in
the
simplest
terms
the
german
officer
stopped
pacing
the
room
and
touched
a
bell
upon
the
table
his
brows
were
furrowed
and
his
broad
capable
hands
tapped
impatiently
among
the
documents
his
summons
was
answered
almost
immediately
by
a
man
in
the
uniform
of
the
jÃ¤gers
the
imperial
forest
service
who
stood
silently
his
heels
together
awaiting
orders
there
has
been
no
word
asked
the
officer
in
german
none
you
stationed
your
men
as
i
directed
yes
excellenz
the
officer
paused
and
then
send
herr
hauptmann
von
winden
the
moment
he
the
man
saluted
wheeled
and
went
out
closing
the
door
noiselessly
behind
him
the
tall
figure
regarded
the
door
fixedly
for
a
moment
in
deep
thought
and
then
tapped
the
back
of
his
left
hand
with
the
fingers
of
his
right
a
habit
he
had
when
things
were
not
going
to
his
liking
general
graf
von
stromberg
privy
councilor
to
the
german
emperor
and
head
of
the
military
sections
of
the
secret
service
was
not
a
person
accustomed
to
have
things
go
wrong
and
delay
of
any
kind
annoyed
him
exceedingly
but
the
door
of
the
room
opened
and
a
young
officer
in
uniform
appeared
and
stood
awaiting
the
will
of
his
superior
he
was
blond
ruddy
and
well
set
up
and
bore
all
the
marks
of
the
army
training
a
member
beyond
doubt
of
the
military
caste
with
something
in
the
clearly
cut
if
somewhat
arrogant
features
of
his
face
which
suggested
good
blood
and
lineage
ah
herr
hauptmann
said
the
general
frowning
you
have
heard
yes
excellenz
he
should
be
here
by
what
was
the
cause
of
the
delay
he
was
forced
to
come
down
at
ostend
yesterday
it
has
taken
him
all
day
to
make
repairs
he
is
on
the
way
von
stromberg
grunted
and
sank
into
his
chair
at
the
table
motioning
the
younger
officer
into
one
beside
him
come
sit
down
let
s
forget
that
we
are
parts
of
the
intricate
machinery
of
state
here
is
a
cigar
smoke
it
will
do
you
von
winden
flattered
by
this
mark
of
condescension
obeyed
you
are
glad
von
stromberg
asked
yes
excellenz
i
am
glad
it
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
one
wants
to
be
worried
about
one
s
own
flesh
and
blood
but
i
knew
there
must
have
been
a
general
von
stromberg
puffed
his
smoke
toward
the
ceiling
and
stretched
his
long
legs
upon
the
floor
it
is
very
curious
i
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
herr
rizzio
is
a
careful
man
and
he
has
much
at
stake
why
should
your
cousin
hammersley
have
refused
to
take
cognizance
of
his
credentials
he
had
doubtless
good
reasons
of
his
own
but
since
he
will
soon
be
here
he
will
answer
your
questions
himself
the
fact
that
he
comes
at
all
excellenz
should
be
proof
of
his
yes
said
the
general
thoughtfully
that
should
be
true
one
doesn
t
thrust
one
s
head
into
the
lion
s
mouth
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
examining
his
teeth
who
sent
this
message
general
von
there
were
no
other
wireless
communications
none
excellenz
but
stammer
should
reach
wilhelmshaven
the
general
smoked
silently
for
a
moment
and
then
herr
hammersley
s
mother
was
a
prussian
yes
excellenz
a
sister
of
my
mother
yes
i
remember
now
von
eppingen
the
general
muttered
his
brows
wrinkled
and
then
you
saw
much
of
your
cousin
for
a
while
he
went
with
me
to
the
gymnasium
then
to
the
university
of
heidelberg
he
has
come
over
each
year
and
shot
with
me
here
at
you
are
fond
of
him
von
winden
shrugged
he
is
my
relative
we
have
always
got
along
i
should
not
have
cared
to
find
that
he
was
a
the
general
smoked
silently
his
gaze
on
the
fire
but
his
father
was
an
englishman
graf
von
winden
we
can
t
forget
that
tell
me
you
have
known
him
always
what
was
his
attitude
at
the
university
did
he
show
a
real
affection
for
german
life
and
customs
in
short
was
he
ever
able
to
forget
that
half
of
him
was
english
udo
von
winden
pulled
at
his
small
blond
mustache
thoughtfully
i
can
only
say
that
he
was
quieter
than
most
of
us
but
he
was
popular
he
was
a
member
of
the
and
represented
the
corps
on
the
mensurboden
against
suevia
and
guestphalia
a
prussian
for
all
that
any
of
us
knew
prussian
of
his
father
died
when
he
was
quite
young
i
believe
yes
excellenz
but
his
father
too
had
lived
much
in
germany
he
was
a
diplomat
and
scholar
and
enjoyed
the
friendship
of
the
iron
chancellor
that
was
before
the
hassgesang
or
before
the
tag
growled
the
general
your
loyalty
to
your
cousin
is
natural
but
loyalty
to
the
vaterland
udo
von
winden
rose
quickly
you
would
not
suggest
excellenz
sit
down
captain
i
suggest
nothing
there
are
merely
some
phases
of
the
question
which
puzzle
me
perhaps
when
he
arrives
he
can
explain
he
will
explain
i
will
stake
my
honor
on
i
trust
so
this
is
hardly
a
time
when
my
department
can
afford
to
make
mistakes
in
the
character
of
those
in
its
but
excellenz
you
surely
have
no
cause
to
doubt
the
exactness
of
the
information
he
has
furnished
you
it
depends
upon
what
you
mean
by
exactness
our
information
as
you
know
comes
from
a
number
of
sources
some
of
it
has
proven
valuable
some
useless
herr
hammersley
s
has
been
neither
the
one
nor
the
but
the
british
fleet
at
cuxhaven
yes
he
gave
us
that
but
they
came
two
days
earlier
than
we
expected
it
cost
us
the
but
you
knew
that
the
orders
were
changed
and
he
sent
a
wireless
the
morning
the
was
sunk
said
von
stromberg
dryly
but
excellenz
he
gave
us
a
clear
sea
for
the
raid
on
falmouth
general
von
stromberg
rose
and
laid
his
hand
on
von
winden
s
shoulder
you
are
younger
than
i
graf
von
winden
the
secret
service
makes
a
maxim
to
believe
everyone
guilty
until
he
proves
his
but
herr
hammersley
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
british
government
permitted
the
raid
on
falmouth
as
a
means
of
increasing
the
he
slowly
paced
the
floor
and
then
said
reassuringly
oh
i
merely
question
i
merely
question
his
words
trailed
off
and
udo
von
winden
stood
silently
until
he
spoke
again
oh
very
well
we
shall
see
we
shall
a
knock
at
the
door
and
an
orderly
entered
well
dispatches
udo
von
winden
watched
his
superior
officer
as
he
dismissed
the
man
and
broke
the
seal
of
a
large
envelope
and
read
the
lamplight
playing
on
his
long
bony
features
giving
his
sharp
nose
a
peculiarly
avidity
the
importance
of
the
communication
was
obvious
for
the
small
eyes
under
the
heavy
thatch
of
brows
flamed
in
sudden
interest
the
general
read
the
paper
through
quickly
and
then
slipped
it
between
the
buttons
of
his
coat
that
will
be
all
herr
hauptmann
he
said
with
a
return
of
his
military
abruptness
you
will
go
at
once
to
the
hangar
and
await
the
arrival
of
herr
and
as
the
officer
moved
toward
the
door
also
you
will
first
tell
herr
hauptmann
wentz
that
i
wish
to
see
him
at
von
winden
clapped
his
heels
together
saluted
and
went
out
while
the
general
paced
the
floor
of
the
room
again
tapping
the
back
of
his
left
hand
with
his
right
it
is
curious
he
muttered
to
himself
a
coincidence
perhaps
but
strange
and
yet
while
he
was
reading
the
document
again
captain
wentz
entered
he
was
short
thickly
set
and
dark
with
a
blue
chin
and
heavy
eyebrows
the
type
of
a
man
who
rises
in
the
service
from
sheer
ability
he
waited
at
the
door
immovable
in
the
presence
of
the
great
man
until
ordered
to
approach
an
important
message
has
come
from
the
wilhelmstrasse
which
indicates
a
mission
of
peculiar
the
general
paused
a
moment
his
keen
eyes
searching
captain
wentz
with
a
terrible
tensity
but
the
face
of
the
younger
man
remained
expressionless
he
was
merely
a
piece
of
machinery
excellent
machinery
you
may
have
thought
it
curious
herr
hauptmann
wentz
that
i
should
have
come
from
the
wilhelmstrasse
to
blaufelden
is
it
not
so
it
is
not
my
duty
to
think
excellenz
unless
ordered
to
do
so
said
the
other
briefly
the
general
smiled
the
answer
pleased
him
i
wished
to
see
herr
hammersley
as
you
know
that
is
important
and
the
yellow
dove
can
not
go
to
he
stopped
and
then
went
on
quickly
herr
hauptmann
you
have
been
attached
to
the
secret
service
department
three
years
yes
you
have
performed
several
important
duties
and
have
won
promotion
i
am
now
about
to
commit
to
your
care
a
at
a
gesture
of
von
stromberg
s
thumb
the
officer
went
on
tiptoe
to
the
door
and
opened
it
quickly
no
one
good
now
sit
first
you
speak
french
without
that
was
a
part
of
my
qualification
for
this
yes
it
is
in
my
mind
to
give
you
an
important
mission
one
which
will
require
great
skill
and
wentz
listened
attentively
but
he
made
no
comment
it
is
unnecessary
of
course
to
warn
you
to
hold
what
i
tell
you
in
the
strictest
i
do
not
talk
this
is
a
matter
of
grave
importance
to
the
empire
a
matter
which
concerns
one
of
the
enemies
of
the
vaterland
the
safe
delivery
of
certain
dispatches
which
i
am
to
receive
may
mean
a
readjustment
of
the
european
situation
perhaps
the
end
of
the
war
with
germany
victorious
and
england
the
eyes
of
captain
wentz
grew
a
little
rounder
and
sparkled
ever
so
slightly
but
he
said
nothing
i
am
telling
you
this
that
you
may
know
the
importance
of
the
duty
i
am
giving
you
it
is
an
honor
which
i
hope
you
will
appreciate
an
honor
that
may
lead
to
greater
favors
than
you
have
hitherto
i
hope
i
may
deserve
them
general
von
stromberg
took
the
paper
from
his
breast
and
glanced
over
it
again
you
will
remember
he
continued
the
affair
of
the
socialist
gottschalk
i
knew
nothing
of
the
details
excellenz
that
matter
came
in
the
duty
of
oberleutnant
von
this
much
then
only
i
need
tell
you
herr
gottschalk
who
lived
at
schÃ¶ndorf
near
here
came
into
the
possession
in
a
manner
which
need
not
be
described
of
certain
important
papers
he
kept
them
for
some
time
not
aware
of
their
importance
and
then
realizing
their
value
and
being
a
good
german
though
opposed
to
the
war
two
weeks
ago
communicated
with
the
government
the
result
of
this
correspondence
was
a
summons
from
berlin
and
the
delivery
of
these
papers
into
the
hands
of
the
emperor
do
you
follow
me
yes
this
letter
which
i
have
just
received
by
special
messenger
informs
me
that
his
majesty
has
decided
to
act
at
once
and
gives
me
three
days
in
which
to
make
arrangements
to
have
these
papers
which
will
be
forwarded
tomorrow
delivered
to
general
dalmier
commanding
at
verdun
to
be
handed
before
a
certain
date
to
the
president
of
the
french
republic
you
are
to
be
the
bearer
of
those
letters
they
must
be
delivered
personally
you
will
be
provided
with
the
proper
passes
and
facilities
including
an
armed
escort
to
the
french
lines
from
there
you
must
trust
to
your
own
resources
the
important
matter
is
that
no
one
not
even
captain
von
winden
shall
suspect
your
mission
perhaps
now
you
will
realize
the
confidence
i
am
i
am
honored
excellenz
these
papers
will
arrive
tomorrow
tomorrow
night
by
automobile
at
eleven
by
the
schÃ¶ndorf
and
until
then
you
will
have
time
to
make
your
i
shall
prepare
captain
wentz
rose
but
the
general
halted
him
one
thing
more
herr
hammersley
is
returning
tonight
from
england
with
dispatches
he
is
to
be
carefully
watched
tonight
and
tomorrow
though
i
shall
let
him
believe
that
he
moves
in
perfect
freedom
you
will
give
the
necessary
orders
also
i
would
like
you
to
keep
watch
outside
the
door
when
he
is
brought
to
this
room
which
may
be
at
any
befehl
that
is
all
you
may
left
alone
general
von
stromberg
took
a
chair
facing
the
fire
and
lighted
another
cigar
for
many
years
he
had
been
engaged
in
deciphering
interesting
problems
and
in
preparing
problems
for
other
persons
to
decipher
therefore
it
may
be
truly
said
that
his
was
the
analytical
mind
the
mind
of
the
chemist
of
the
mathematician
and
the
philosopher
with
so
complete
a
schooling
in
the
trade
of
deception
that
all
things
and
all
persons
in
the
cosmic
scheme
except
himself
were
objects
of
suspicion
for
him
the
obvious
was
the
negligible
and
by
converse
the
negligible
of
prime
importance
as
he
had
said
to
von
winden
every
man
was
guilty
until
he
was
proven
innocent
he
had
a
rare
nose
for
scenting
unsuspected
odors
and
a
fine
hand
for
finding
the
weak
links
in
the
armor
of
those
he
used
as
well
as
of
those
who
sought
to
use
him
he
had
a
faculty
for
appearing
at
places
where
he
was
least
expected
and
a
prescience
almost
miraculous
in
forestalling
the
moves
of
his
adversaries
he
ruled
by
fear
and
by
admiration
and
there
was
not
a
man
in
the
empire
with
a
skeleton
in
his
closet
no
matter
how
high
his
station
who
did
not
live
without
a
terror
of
von
stromberg
in
his
heart
but
the
habit
of
mind
of
suspecting
everybody
while
it
had
placed
him
upon
the
safe
side
of
every
equation
had
also
resulted
through
the
elimination
of
the
sentimental
in
eliminating
the
more
direct
contacts
with
human
nature
to
judge
a
man
by
his
possibilities
for
venality
is
like
judging
a
rose
by
the
sharpness
of
its
thorn
something
of
the
weakness
of
this
cynicism
had
been
apparent
to
the
keen
intellect
of
von
stromberg
and
he
had
been
finding
of
late
a
rare
pleasure
in
trifling
with
his
convictions
admitting
into
the
stored
cavern
of
his
mind
for
experimental
purposes
an
occasional
ray
of
optimism
at
the
present
moment
he
was
analyzing
the
result
of
his
summons
to
herr
hammersley
to
come
to
germany
at
once
and
the
communication
from
herr
rizzio
which
impugned
herr
hammersley
s
loyalty
to
germany
von
stromberg
had
known
herr
rizzio
for
years
and
had
done
him
more
than
one
service
in
finding
ways
to
cater
to
his
passion
for
collecting
objects
of
art
it
was
german
social
influence
secretly
exerted
that
had
helped
to
make
easy
rizzio
s
rise
in
favor
at
the
court
of
james
there
had
been
a
possibility
that
some
day
john
rizzio
might
be
of
service
to
von
stromberg
and
to
germany
and
von
stromberg
had
long
been
laying
the
plans
which
had
made
his
system
of
espionage
the
most
perfect
in
europe
von
stromberg
had
found
rizzio
s
weakness
and
had
traded
on
it
saving
his
most
tempting
bait
for
his
greatest
service
the
betrayal
of
the
home
of
his
adoption
he
weighed
rizzio
contentedly
sure
of
his
own
power
over
him
and
despising
him
for
having
been
so
easily
bought
rubens
s
descent
from
the
cross
there
were
fortunately
other
rubenses
in
conquered
territory
some
very
good
ones
that
john
rizzio
might
like
von
stromberg
had
made
a
list
of
them
he
had
learned
that
it
was
as
necessary
to
be
provided
with
bribes
as
with
threats
fortunately
rizzio
himself
had
given
him
material
for
the
latter
racially
the
great
councilor
did
not
like
latins
and
he
was
quite
sure
he
cared
less
for
italians
now
than
he
did
before
the
proclamation
of
neutrality
they
were
not
to
be
trusted
by
good
germans
if
rizzio
had
played
false
to
the
country
of
his
adoption
for
the
sake
of
a
paltry
picture
it
was
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
that
he
could
be
false
to
germany
if
the
necessity
arose
for
an
even
smaller
consideration
yesterday
morning
before
leaving
berlin
for
windenberg
von
stromberg
had
received
a
dispatch
from
rizzio
which
told
of
his
departure
on
his
yacht
from
scotland
for
bremen
this
was
curious
also
interesting
rizzio
was
needed
in
england
and
was
useless
in
germany
why
was
he
coming
had
something
been
learned
of
him
at
scotland
yard
or
had
his
departure
to
do
with
the
case
of
herr
hammersley
whatever
the
visit
meant
it
was
necessary
very
necessary
to
have
rizzio
and
hammersley
together
at
once
so
he
had
deemed
it
wise
to
send
orders
to
bremen
to
have
rizzio
caught
on
the
wireless
and
when
he
reached
port
sent
through
at
once
to
windenberg
von
stromberg
smiled
in
there
would
be
no
loose
ends
about
this
affair
merely
as
a
precaution
in
so
important
a
matter
he
had
set
one
agent
to
watch
another
byfield
had
been
watched
by
hammersley
who
in
turn
had
been
watched
by
rizzio
who
had
been
watched
by
herr
maxwell
an
agent
long
in
von
stromberg
s
service
rizzio
had
been
given
the
power
and
credentials
to
use
his
discretion
with
hammersley
why
had
not
hammersley
relinquished
the
cigarette
papers
to
rizzio
hammersley
should
have
good
reasons
for
his
refusal
was
there
reason
for
hammersley
to
suspect
rizzio
herr
maxwell
who
had
been
set
to
watch
rizzio
was
silent
this
was
puzzling
what
had
happened
to
herr
maxwell
general
von
stromberg
threw
his
finished
cigar
into
the
fire
and
got
up
rubbing
his
hands
together
oh
it
was
very
interesting
very
the
situation
was
rapidly
approaching
culmination
in
a
short
while
all
the
threads
of
this
pretty
tangle
would
be
within
reach
of
his
long
fingers
and
all
that
he
von
stromberg
had
to
do
was
to
catch
them
by
the
ends
and
hold
what
would
herr
hammersley
bring
general
von
stromberg
straightened
listening
the
sound
of
voices
and
men
outside
so
he
was
here
already
there
had
been
no
sound
from
the
machine
of
course
he
had
planed
down
a
knock
on
the
door
and
von
winden
wentz
and
hammersley
entered
chapter
xii
hammersley
explains
at
the
sight
of
the
tall
figure
of
von
stromberg
hammersley
halted
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
and
then
came
forward
into
the
room
he
still
wore
his
leather
jacket
and
cap
but
the
wind
burn
on
his
cheeks
gave
his
eyes
which
had
been
protected
by
goggles
a
singular
grayness
he
had
had
no
sleep
and
his
face
was
drawn
in
haggard
lines
but
his
greeting
showed
no
signs
of
uneasiness
had
i
known
you
were
awaiting
me
excellenz
i
should
perhaps
have
made
quicker
it
does
not
matter
that
you
are
late
said
von
stromberg
quickly
the
thing
of
main
importance
is
that
you
are
the
general
turned
and
made
a
motion
to
the
door
of
the
room
i
wish
to
be
alone
with
herr
hammersley
herr
hauptmann
von
winden
you
are
relieved
from
duty
for
the
night
herr
hauptmann
wentz
you
will
remain
within
the
two
officers
saluted
and
retired
and
the
general
motioned
hammersley
to
approach
you
have
it
he
asked
briefly
yes
excellenz
he
produced
from
an
inner
pocket
a
small
package
wrapped
in
oiled
paper
and
handed
it
to
von
stromberg
ah
he
went
quickly
over
to
the
table
and
tearing
off
the
wrapper
of
the
bundle
opened
the
packet
of
and
found
the
hidden
message
which
he
scanned
quickly
with
muttered
ejaculations
of
satisfaction
and
surprise
hammersley
by
the
fireplace
was
warming
his
hands
gut
said
the
general
straightening
and
turning
you
had
difficulties
more
than
usual
excellenz
captain
byfield
is
in
caught
hammersley
nodded
they
found
letters
at
his
were
there
no
fires
hammersley
shrugged
he
is
to
be
tried
by
he
will
be
von
stromberg
deliberated
a
moment
and
were
you
suspected
yes
they
followed
me
to
scotland
but
fortunately
the
yellow
dove
is
still
a
mystery
at
least
it
was
yesterday
morning
and
i
got
safely
von
stromberg
was
scrutinizing
him
keenly
h
what
makes
you
think
that
you
were
followed
i
left
london
by
night
train
but
got
off
at
edinburgh
where
my
motor
met
me
but
the
wire
was
faster
and
they
had
sent
word
to
stop
me
they
stretched
a
rope
across
the
road
but
i
saw
it
and
went
around
they
fired
at
me
when
was
this
three
nights
they
didn
t
hit
you
a
mere
scratch
across
the
arm
let
me
see
hammersley
looked
into
von
stromberg
s
face
and
laughed
really
he
asked
rather
stiffly
hammersley
took
off
his
leather
jacket
and
sweater
and
rolled
up
the
sleeve
of
his
flannel
shirt
von
stromberg
examined
the
wound
with
interest
so
he
said
put
on
your
coat
and
after
that
i
kept
away
from
and
put
up
for
the
night
at
my
cousin
who
is
that
lady
heathcote
oh
yes
it
was
at
her
house
in
london
that
the
message
passed
to
yes
von
stromberg
paused
a
moment
and
then
spoke
abruptly
why
did
you
not
give
the
papers
to
rizzio
hammersley
s
gaze
met
the
general
s
squarely
they
were
too
important
i
could
not
take
the
but
his
orders
superseded
i
saw
but
i
could
not
take
the
why
because
i
had
reason
to
believe
that
rizzio
was
acting
for
the
english
von
stromberg
s
burning
gaze
flickered
and
went
out
he
took
a
few
paces
across
the
room
his
right
hand
tapping
the
back
of
his
left
at
last
he
came
and
stood
before
hammersley
his
hands
behind
his
back
what
were
your
reasons
for
believing
that
maxwell
learned
it
from
maxwell
you
saw
maxwell
when
the
night
i
left
has
anything
happened
to
him
quickly
i
do
not
the
general
frowned
into
the
fire
it
is
strange
he
muttered
very
strange
you
did
not
realize
then
that
i
suspected
you
hammersley
laughed
not
at
once
i
did
later
that
is
your
privilege
excellenz
but
i
refused
to
be
caught
under
the
circumstances
i
preferred
to
take
the
risk
of
failure
after
all
you
see
i
general
von
stromberg
was
not
immune
from
the
frankness
of
hammersley
s
smile
he
turned
toward
the
table
and
scrutinized
the
papers
with
great
care
these
are
the
very
papers
you
got
from
herr
captain
byfield
hammersley
s
reply
was
startling
unfortunately
no
the
original
papers
were
burned
burned
cried
the
general
turning
in
his
chair
but
not
before
i
had
made
this
copy
which
i
put
in
a
safe
i
was
followed
leaving
lady
heathcote
s
dinner
party
in
an
automobile
by
agents
of
scotland
yard
i
had
the
slower
machine
and
they
caught
me
but
not
before
i
had
passed
the
original
papers
to
my
companion
your
companion
a
woman
yes
excellenz
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
she
escaped
while
they
were
searching
me
and
kept
the
papers
who
was
this
woman
my
her
name
doris
english
no
and
what
happened
then
excellenz
she
read
them
she
is
devoted
to
the
english
cause
i
could
do
nothing
she
learned
that
i
was
acting
for
germany
and
rather
than
let
them
fall
into
my
hands
she
burned
them
it
makes
no
difference
to
you
or
to
the
vaterland
since
i
have
brought
the
message
here
except
that
my
own
utility
in
england
is
i
should
be
sorry
to
be
obliged
to
believe
i
am
afraid
excellenz
that
there
is
nothing
left
for
you
to
general
von
stromberg
was
again
busy
examining
the
cigarette
papers
suddenly
he
raised
his
head
his
gaze
boring
into
hammersley
s
face
you
say
this
is
a
copy
of
the
original
message
yes
and
where
did
you
make
it
in
the
library
upstairs
at
lady
heathcote
s
in
park
when
after
my
interview
with
herr
rizzio
it
is
written
hurriedly
as
you
will
it
is
written
with
a
pen
finer
than
those
usually
employed
by
i
took
what
offered
excellenz
said
hammersley
what
was
your
thought
when
you
made
the
copy
that
rizzio
or
his
agents
would
attempt
to
get
it
away
from
me
it
seems
that
i
was
are
you
sure
that
he
was
acting
for
england
and
not
for
me
asked
von
stromberg
quickly
for
excellenz
did
it
not
occur
to
you
that
your
failure
to
accede
to
his
request
might
have
given
herr
rizzio
the
idea
that
you
were
saving
this
document
from
him
in
order
that
you
might
deliver
it
to
the
war
office
how
could
such
an
idea
occur
to
me
when
i
already
knew
what
his
object
was
oh
you
are
convinced
that
he
is
for
the
english
cause
naturally
i
can
conceive
of
no
reason
why
rizzio
should
be
for
von
stromberg
smiled
if
this
were
skill
in
parry
he
rejoiced
in
having
met
his
match
if
it
were
merely
ingenuousness
he
was
equally
at
a
loss
he
had
often
admitted
to
himself
that
there
were
but
two
kinds
of
people
in
the
world
that
he
could
not
cope
with
those
who
never
lost
their
tempers
and
those
who
told
the
truth
he
had
taken
advantage
of
hammersley
s
physical
condition
to
provoke
him
into
irritation
but
the
man
was
quite
unruffled
the
piercing
eye
the
threatening
tone
and
the
dominant
air
of
authority
which
von
stromberg
had
so
frequently
found
effective
with
others
had
been
of
no
avail
here
herr
hammersley
stood
by
the
fire
erect
and
unperturbed
calmly
awaiting
his
dismissal
if
he
had
told
the
truth
then
rizzio
herr
rizzio
has
advised
me
that
you
are
disloyal
to
germany
said
the
general
at
last
you
inform
me
that
he
is
loyal
to
hammersley
shrugged
and
laughed
if
i
were
disloyal
to
germany
surely
i
had
proof
enough
of
your
suspicions
in
your
secret
summons
to
remain
at
it
is
unnecessary
for
me
to
say
that
i
should
have
come
without
that
summons
because
it
was
dangerous
for
me
to
you
would
then
have
me
disregard
the
message
from
herr
rizzio
no
i
merely
ask
that
you
wait
until
you
hear
from
herr
and
if
herr
maxwell
be
dead
asked
von
stromberg
quietly
hammersley
s
face
became
grave
in
that
case
excellenz
i
must
rely
on
your
keenness
to
decide
the
issue
between
von
stromberg
slipped
the
packet
of
papers
into
an
inner
pocket
and
rose
with
a
laugh
he
covered
the
distance
between
himself
and
hammersley
in
three
paces
with
extended
hands
i
was
only
trying
you
herr
hammersley
it
is
a
habit
of
mine
it
amuses
me
you
will
forgive
me
willingly
excellenz
if
you
will
provide
me
with
food
and
a
bed
failing
those
you
may
have
me
shot
at
food
you
shall
have
and
a
bed
is
prepared
in
your
room
upstairs
as
for
the
shooting
perhaps
we
may
as
well
postpone
that
until
he
laughed
jovially
showing
a
very
fine
set
of
teeth
and
touching
a
bell
which
was
answered
by
captain
wentz
directed
that
food
and
coffee
be
prepared
at
once
one
word
more
he
went
on
when
wentz
went
out
where
did
you
put
this
copy
after
leaving
lady
heathcote
s
in
london
i
slipped
it
down
the
window
sash
in
my
automobile
they
did
not
even
search
for
it
i
got
away
by
a
no
one
saw
it
no
one
the
message
is
the
h
m
you
have
a
good
memory
are
you
sure
that
the
war
office
knew
of
your
movements
positive
i
know
of
no
one
who
would
try
to
kill
me
rizzio
acting
for
england
and
if
he
were
acting
for
germany
then
he
is
a
von
stromberg
folded
his
long
arms
and
gazed
at
the
lamp
you
do
not
feel
that
it
would
be
possible
to
return
at
once
not
unless
i
wished
to
be
shot
as
a
what
will
you
do
take
whatever
service
you
will
give
me
failing
that
i
will
volunteer
for
the
general
without
pursuing
the
subject
further
motioned
hammersley
to
the
door
you
will
find
food
ready
after
eating
you
had
better
get
to
bed
i
will
talk
with
you
further
in
the
as
the
door
closed
behind
his
visitor
von
stromberg
sank
into
the
chair
by
the
fire
and
lighted
a
third
cigar
upon
which
he
pulled
steadily
for
some
moments
rehearsing
by
question
and
reply
almost
every
word
of
hammersley
s
story
by
every
rule
of
the
game
as
he
knew
it
herr
hammersley
should
be
a
liar
and
yet
his
story
from
first
to
last
held
water
there
was
not
a
flaw
in
its
texture
from
beginning
to
end
if
hammersley
had
not
told
the
truth
he
was
the
most
skillful
liar
in
europe
a
man
who
gave
the
appearance
of
truthfulness
to
the
last
hair
of
his
head
and
yet
it
was
much
more
easy
to
lie
if
one
knew
that
there
was
no
man
to
oppose
him
hammersley
did
not
know
that
rizzio
was
on
the
way
tomorrow
they
would
meet
it
would
be
interesting
to
watch
that
meeting
for
as
to
this
thing
the
mind
of
the
general
was
clear
one
of
these
men
was
false
to
germany
the
other
true
but
which
both
had
come
willingly
or
was
it
by
necessity
and
herr
maxwell
it
was
strange
that
maxwell
should
have
failed
in
his
report
at
this
crucial
moment
and
if
maxwell
were
dead
who
had
betrayed
him
general
von
stromberg
s
thoughts
were
interrupted
by
a
knock
on
the
door
and
the
entrance
of
the
orderly
a
telegram
excellenz
by
motorcycle
from
the
general
opened
the
paper
it
was
in
code
and
he
translated
it
rapidly
von
stromberg
withhold
judgment
until
my
arrival
will
be
at
bremen
tomorrow
early
with
miss
mather
who
possesses
valuable
information
rizzio
general
von
stromberg
sank
deeper
into
his
chair
the
paper
in
his
fingers
a
smile
broadening
upon
his
features
the
woman
it
was
almost
too
good
to
be
true
miss
doris
mather
the
american
girl
hammersley
s
fiancÃ©e
coming
to
germany
with
rizzio
and
hammersley
obviously
did
not
know
it

to
my
room
good
good
night
meanwhile
upstairs
in
his
room
hammersley
after
having
eaten
was
preparing
for
bed
for
a
tired
man
he
went
about
it
in
a
very
leisurely
way
smoking
a
cigarette
and
wandering
about
the
room
stretching
his
long
limbs
and
yawning
between
whiles
then
after
a
time
he
took
off
his
clothes
and
bathed
it
was
perhaps
an
hour
before
he
blew
out
his
candle
and
even
then
he
did
not
get
immediately
into
bed
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
couch
for
a
while
listening
and
watching
the
cold
moonlight
outside
his
dormer
window
or
the
dim
line
of
light
that
came
from
beneath
the
door
into
the
hall
then
apparently
satisfied
that
he
was
to
be
quite
free
from
interruption
he
straightened
and
stood
up
waiting
again
still
no
sound
he
reached
for
the
table
where
he
had
put
his
watch
and
the
things
from
his
pockets
and
picked
up
a
large
carefully
opening
the
large
blade
then
with
quick
noiseless
footsteps
he
crossed
the
room
to
the
fireplace
and
felt
with
the
fingers
of
one
hand
carefully
along
the
edge
of
the
chimney
breast
his
fingers
reached
a
spot
where
there
was
an
unevenness
and
feeling
carefully
thrust
the
its
full
length
beneath
the
paper
slowly
withdrawing
it
something
protruded
which
was
quickly
taken
into
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
with
great
care
he
smoothed
the
broken
wallpaper
back
into
its
place
and
noiselessly
closing
the
knife
got
softly
into
bed
he
lay
on
his
back
for
a
while
his
eyes
wide
open
watching
the
window
and
the
door
and
then
pulling
the
heavy
blankets
up
slipped
lower
and
lower
under
the
covers
until
he
disappeared
from
view
in
the
room
all
was
dark
but
under
the
blankets
he
read
by
the
light
of
an
electric
pocket
torch
some
writing
in
german
upon
a
thin
slip
of
paper

chapter
xiii
the
unwilling
guest
after
the
light
of
dawn
went
out
upon
the
cliffs
of
rhuda
mor
doris
mather
hung
for
a
long
while
upon
the
brink
of
an
abyss
below
her
darkness
above
her
light
she
strove
upward
but
in
the
dim
moments
of
was
aware
of
a
force
restraining
her
and
a
recurrence
of
the
odor
in
which
the
darkness
had
first
come
she
had
a
sense
of
motion
and
of
jolting
the
feeling
of
arms
about
her
a
descent
the
sound
of
water
and
the
rocking
of
a
boat
brief
glimpses
she
had
of
sunlight
which
revealed
outlines
dimly
like
the
glow
of
summer
lightning
upon
familiar
objects
making
them
curiously
unfamiliar
john
rizzio
s
face
persisted
in
these
visions
a
fantastic
rizzio
much
larger
than
the
man
she
knew
deferential
and
punctilious
as
ever
and
strangely
grave
a
stout
man
with
a
swarthy
face
in
a
cap
and
brass
buttons
just
above
her
darkly
outlined
against
white
clouds
which
seemed
to
be
whirling
rapidly
past
him
dully
she
found
herself
wondering
where
the
clouds
were
going
so
rapidly
and
why
they
didn
t
come
back
later
darkness
and
peace
where
there
were
no
visions
and
the
sky
no
longer
whirled
a
steady
vibration
which
soothed
her
and
she
blissfully
slept
when
she
awoke
the
visions
were
gone
and
as
her
senses
returned
she
started
up
but
her
head
swam
and
she
sank
back
again
as
she
had
risen
a
woman
emerged
from
the
shadows
of
the
room
and
came
forward
and
then
slowly
as
full
consciousness
returned
the
girl
realized
that
she
was
on
an
vessel
in
a
cabin
or
stateroom
very
beautifully
appointed
she
started
up
in
her
bed
and
looked
out
of
the
to
see
the
amber
crests
of
waves
leaping
rapidly
past
then
she
heard
the
woman
s
voice
speaking
you
are
feeling
better
doris
turned
and
looked
at
her
a
woman
of
middle
age
with
a
kindly
face
dressed
in
white
linen
what
yacht
is
this
she
asked
the
miss
rizzio
s
she
replied
doris
thought
for
a
moment
the
last
thing
her
waking
consciousness
remembered
were
the
cliffs
of
rhuda
mor
how
did
i
come
here
she
asked
again
the
woman
shook
her
head
i
don
t
know
her
manner
was
kind
and
most
respectful
but
her
tone
was
decisive
she
was
obeying
instructions
is
rizzio
aboard
doris
asked
again
yes
miss
and
he
asked
me
to
tell
you
that
when
you
felt
sufficiently
recovered
he
would
be
glad
to
wait
upon
you
in
the
oh
i
when
doris
rose
and
put
her
feet
to
the
swaying
deck
nausea
overcame
her
but
the
woman
who
was
prepared
for
this
emergency
offered
a
glass
filled
with
cloudy
liquid
drink
this
she
said
it
will
make
you
feel
doris
looked
into
the
woman
s
face
and
recognizing
the
aromatic
odor
took
the
draught
the
nausea
passed
after
a
moment
and
she
managed
to
get
up
and
make
her
way
to
the
bathroom
as
she
bathed
her
face
memory
returned
full
memory
of
the
events
of
the
previous
night
the
scene
upon
the
cliffs
with
cyril
the
destroyer
rizzio
stryker
rudha
mor
the
yellow
dove
and
then
unconsciousness
chloroform
there
were
vestiges
of
it
upon
her
clothing
still
they
had
drugged
her
when
she
took
off
her
shirtwaist
something
fell
to
the
floor
a
paper
she
picked
it
up
and
looked
at
it
it
was
rizzio
s
note
to
her
at
kilmorack
house
asking
her
to
come
to
so
that
he
might
make
her
prisoner
she
remembered
now
that
she
had
thrust
it
into
her
waist
when
she
went
out
she
folded
the
letter
carefully
and
put
it
in
her
stays
after
the
other
indignity
she
had
suffered
it
seemed
strange
that
they
had
not
searched
her
too
she
would
keep
the
letter
perhaps
later
she
would
find
use
for
it
john
rizzio
it
was
difficult
for
her
mind
to
associate
him
with
the
villainy
of
abduction
and
yet
as
her
brain
grew
clearer
she
became
quite
sure
that
there
was
no
other
answer
to
the
problem
indeed
from
the
replies
of
the
stewardess
she
knew
that
john
rizzio
had
chosen
that
she
should
know
it
was
to
be
a
problem
no
longer
the
that
was
his
yacht
she
had
been
on
the
boat
before
two
years
ago
during
the
races
in
the
solent
abduction
he
had
dared
she
was
not
frightened
yet
fury
at
his
temerity
blinded
her
to
all
sense
of
danger
a
phrase
of
cyril
s
came
back
to
her
illuminating
the
chaos
of
her
thoughts
you
know
too
much
too
much
for
your
own
good
or
cyril
s
cigarette
papers
she
was
the
only
one
beside
cyril
who
had
read
their
contents
rizzio
had
carried
her
off
had
brought
her
to
the
which
was
out
of
sight
of
land
speeding
for
germany
what
was
he
going
to
do
with
her
fury
passed
and
weakness
followed
she
did
not
know
what
time
of
day
it
was
but
she
was
aware
that
it
had
been
long
since
she
had
eaten
in
the
cabin
she
found
a
tray
set
with
food
and
coffee
which
the
stewardess
insisted
upon
serving
her
she
sank
into
an
armchair
refusing
to
eat
but
the
woman
persisted
and
the
odor
of
the
coffee
was
tempting
it
was
luncheon
she
found
and
remembered
that
she
had
had
no
appetite
for
dinner
at
lady
heathcote
s
and
that
it
must
be
quite
hours
since
she
had
broken
bread
the
coffee
gave
her
courage
and
in
spite
of
herself
she
found
that
she
was
eating
heartily
with
a
genuine
relish
she
was
a
good
sailor
and
the
nausea
which
she
now
knew
was
the
effect
of
the
drug
had
passed
the
stewardess
stood
beside
her
and
to
the
other
questions
doris
put
to
her
answered
politely
but
volunteered
nothing
further
than
she
had
already
told
in
spite
of
the
woman
s
care
and
attention
the
girl
could
not
get
rid
of
the
idea
that
the
stewardess
had
been
sent
as
a
guardian
as
well
as
a
maid
she
was
a
prisoner
of
john
rizzio
of
germany
whither
he
was
bringing
her
as
fast
as
the
yacht
could
take
them
finding
at
last
that
her
attempts
to
extract
information
from
her
stolid
servitress
were
fruitless
and
feeling
strengthened
by
the
food
she
had
taken
she
got
up
and
told
the
woman
that
she
was
going
on
deck
asking
that
rizzio
be
informed
that
she
would
see
him
as
she
emerged
upon
deck
the
crisp
wintry
air
sent
the
color
slowly
into
her
pallid
cheeks
the
yacht
was
bowling
along
with
the
wind
and
sea
quartering
and
the
leaped
alongside
sending
an
occasional
spurt
of
spray
into
the
air
where
the
wind
caught
it
and
blew
it
across
the
decks
in
a
feathery
mist
of
rainbows
the
sunlight
glinted
on
polished
wood
and
brasswork
and
at
the
stern
caught
in
the
cross
of
george
where
the
flag
of
england
flapped
in
the
breeze
the
flag
of
england
sheltering
john
rizzio
she
scanned
the
horizon
anxiously
perhaps
an
english
cruiser
or
destroyer
might
come
to
whom
she
might
be
able
to
tell
the
real
character
of
the
owner
of
the
vessel
but
there
was
no
vessel
in
sight
a
sailor
passed
her
and
touched
his
cap
the
deference
encouraged
her
it
reminded
her
that
this
was
the
same
deck
upon
which
she
had
stood
when
john
rizzio
was
suing
for
her
hand
an
honorable
host
when
she
had
been
an
honored
guest
a
loud
crackling
came
to
her
ears
from
the
wireless
room
he
was
there
already
in
communication
with
his
employers
in
germany
even
now
with
cyril
s
words
still
ringing
in
her
ears
she
found
it
difficult
to
believe
that
john
rizzio
was
england
s
enemy
and
the
price
of
his
treachery
a
picture
the
descent
from
the
cross
what
a
mockery
that
a
man
who
would
stoop
to
such
dishonor
could
make
its
price
a
picture
which
typified
the
conquest
of
sublime
virtue
even
over
death
the
wind
was
searching
and
the
maid
brought
a
heavy
coat
with
brass
buttons
from
below
and
put
it
on
her
with
the
word
that
rizzio
had
sent
it
and
would
come
to
her
in
a
few
moments
she
sat
in
a
deckchair
in
the
lee
of
the
deckhouse
her
lips
firmly
compressed
trying
to
think
what
his
ulterior
purpose
might
be
planning
a
defense
which
might
make
her
invulnerable
an
attack
which
might
search
his
intentions
and
discover
the
true
relation
that
was
to
exist
between
them
he
came
toward
her
from
forward
muffled
in
a
greatcoat
and
carrying
a
rug
he
took
off
his
cap
with
an
air
of
deference
which
answered
at
once
some
of
her
questions
she
rose
and
faced
him
her
color
high
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
me
she
asked
trying
to
keep
her
lips
from
trembling
he
smiled
and
pulled
at
his
mustache
first
i
hope
you
ll
give
me
a
chance
to
what
she
cried
hotly
what
can
you
explain
don
t
you
suppose
i
know
what
you
are
a
german
spy
a
traitor
to
england
and
worse
than
that
a
and
a
coward
he
bent
his
head
i
make
no
defense
he
said
except
and
then
gravely
indicating
the
chair
from
which
she
had
risen
won
t
you
sit
down
the
voyage
may
be
but
she
still
stood
i
am
a
prisoner
not
a
then
i
command
you
to
sit
he
said
with
a
laugh
won
t
you
a
sound
of
exasperation
came
from
her
throat
and
she
obeyed
him
her
gaze
on
the
sea
while
with
some
ostentation
he
covered
her
with
a
rug
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
me
in
germany
she
repeated
dully
he
sank
into
the
chair
beside
her
as
i
have
often
told
you
you
are
a
woman
of
rare
intelligence
in
reply
i
can
only
say
that
unfortunately
i
do
not
a
coward
who
is
also
a
a
liar
she
said
bitterly
a
coward
is
usually
a
liar
but
a
liar
isn
t
always
a
coward
i
am
a
liar
doris
if
you
will
but
a
courageous
my
name
is
mather
she
said
distinctly
he
shrugged
and
turned
his
gaze
on
the
sea
you
hate
me
of
course
we
are
enemies
i
am
sorry
i
warned
you
that
you
were
entangled
in
an
affair
that
was
leading
you
into
dangerous
paths
i
would
have
saved
you
if
i
could
but
you
had
learned
too
and
so
you
had
me
chloroformed
it
was
a
pity
that
you
didn
t
complete
your
i
merely
did
what
was
required
of
me
through
a
most
unfortunate
combination
of
circumstances
you
came
into
possession
of
a
secret
known
to
but
one
person
in
england
and
you
are
the
only
person
with
english
sympathies
who
knows
my
exact
political
status
a
spy
contemptuously
what
you
will
a
spy
if
you
like
but
a
strong
friend
of
germany
who
resents
an
attempt
by
a
nation
jealous
of
her
growing
commercial
supremacy
to
wipe
her
out
of
existence
i
have
lived
in
england
long
and
i
have
known
many
of
the
men
who
have
made
her
what
she
is
but
never
in
all
those
years
has
england
ever
given
me
one
token
of
the
high
nobility
she
preaches
i
have
passed
for
many
years
as
an
englishman
i

pray

m
afraid
you

at
my
mercy
i
shall
try
to
be
lenient
you
are
an
american
i
am
an
italian
to
call
me
a
traitor
to
england
because
i
happen
to
have
a
liking
for
germany
would
be
much
like
my
calling
you
a
traitor
to
germany
because
you
happen
to
have
a
liking
for
i
have
never
eaten
the
bread
and
salt
of
germany
or
wormed
my
way
into
the
hearts
of
its
i
m
sure
you
flatter
me
the
people
of
my
set
in
london
are
agreeable
but
doris
had
straightened
in
the
act
of
rising
i
did
not
come
on
deck
to
discuss
your
ideals
or
germany
s
i
hope
that
you
will
excuse
you
will
not
listen
no
i
care
nothing
for
your
political
views
i
am
your
prisoner
i
want
to
know
without
further
words
the
worst
that
i
am
to
expect
from
you
have
been
upon
the
before
what
was
proper
for
you
then
is
proper
for
you
now
you
are
quite
safe
in
my
hands
i
shall
try
to
make
you
comfortable
does
that
answer
your
question
and
after
you
are
to
be
delivered
to
the
head
of
the
secret
service
department
of
the
german
the
girl
paled
and
sank
back
into
her
chair
why
she
asked
because
you
are
in
possession
of
information
that
he
what
information
it
isn
t
true
i
know
i
am
sorry
he
apologized
again
the
cigarette
papers
you
read
no
you
forget
that
you
have
already
admitted
that
you
have
also
read
the
second
message
which
was
to
take
the
place
of
the
you
are
dreaming
a
second
message
i
know
nothing
of
a
second
pardon
me
if
i
remind
you
of
it
you
would
have
burned
it
in
the
at
kilmorack
house
if
hammersley
hadn
t
taken
it
from
your
she
stared
at
him
bewildered
at
his
astounding
omniscience
his
devilish
ingenuity
it
frightened
her
his
cleverness
and
his
pursuit
of
her
it
seemed
that
she
had
never
had
a
chance
to
get
away
from
him
and
yet
his
manner
was
so
carefully
studied
his
attitude
toward
her
so
coldly
impersonal
that
as
a
man
once
a
lover
she
no
longer
feared
him
if
love
of
her
had
ever
been
in
his
heart
a
greater
passion
had
burned
it
out
she
was
grateful
for
this
and
prepared
to
measure
her
woman
s
wit
to
his
thinking
of
cyril
what
would
cyril
have
her
do
you
mean
that
you
will
let
them
the
germans
question
me
if
they
wish
to
do
but
how
will
it
benefit
them
if
the
papers
are
already
in
their
possession
you
will
forgive
me
if
i
find
it
possible
to
she
turned
away
from
him
and
studied
the
lines
of
foam
that
streamed
across
the
green
troughs
of
the
sea
i
suppose
that
conversation
between
us
two
is
superfluous
you
distrust
me
and
i
i
think
perhaps
he
said
gravely
that
it
would
be
pleasanter
for
both
of
us
not
to
hear
your
sentiments
toward
me
since
the
night
of
lady
heathcote
s
dinner
in
london
you
ceased
to
be
miss
doris
mather
and
became
merely
an
official
document
it
is
my
duty
to
preserve
it
and
deliver
it
i
hope
you
may
succeed
otherwise
the
american
ambassador
in
berlin
may
unfortunately
he
went
on
quietly
the
american
ambassador
can
not
be
she
laughed
with
a
greater
confidence
than
she
felt
you
surely
can
t
believe
that
my
absence
from
england
will
pass
unnoticed
do
you
think
that
my
father
that
lady
heathcote
she
paused
bewildered
they
will
merely
know
that
you
rode
late
at
night
to
and
that
your
horse
was
found
riderless
on
the
she
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
and
a
sob
broke
from
her
throat
it
was
true
they
would
think
her
dead
for
the
first
time
she
really
was
able
to
think
of
things
in
their
true
aspect
it
s
cruel
she
gasped
how
could
you
he
was
too
wise
to
touch
her
or
even
by
his
manner
to
show
too
deep
a
sympathy
i
am
sorry
he
said
coolly
awfully
sorry
as
you
know
i
would
have
had
things
different
you
may
still
doubt
me
when
i
say
that
what
i
have
done
is
the
hardest
task
that
i
ever
undertook
in
my
life
but
that
is
true
you
were
the
only
person
in
england
who
jeopardized
my
existence
there
i
had
to
take
you
away
i
regret
the
necessity
of
having
to
use
force
i
shall
do
what
i
can
here
upon
the
to
counteract
the
unpleasant
impression
of
my
brutality
i
am
not
a
bully
and
a
i
am
a
spoke
in
the
wheel
of
destiny
which
you
had
clogged
by
all
the
rules
of
the
game
you
should
have
died
reasons
which
i
need
not
mention
made
your
death
at
my
hands
an
impossibility
so
i
merely
removed
you
to
a
place
of
safety
no
harm
shall
come
to
you
i
pledge
my
thanks
she
said
dully
struggling
up
her
face
away
from
him
and
then
dauntlessly
small
a
thing
as
it
is
i
must
be
content
with
she
had
risen
and
turned
and
now
if
you
don
t
mind
i
will
go
below
i
would
prefer
to
be
alone
if
as
you
protest
you
would
do
me
kindness
you
will
not
ask
to
see
he
bowed
i
have
given
instructions
that
you
shall
be
allowed
to
do
as
you
please
madden
will
furnish
you
with
all
that
you
require
both
i
think
of
linen
and
toilet
articles
i
shall
not
try
to
see
you
again
until
we
she
bowed
her
head
and
went
down
rizzio
watched
her
until
she
disappeared
and
then
walked
over
to
the
rail
and
peered
out
over
the
sea
it
had
taken
some
to
go
through
this
interview
as
he
had
planned
it
and
in
conquering
himself
he
had
succeeded
in
establishing
a
relation
between
them
which
made
his
presence
at
least
bearable
to
her
the
impersonal
tone
which
he
had
used
through
the
interview
was
the
one
most
calculated
to
put
her
at
her
ease
with
him
and
the
perfect
frankness
of
his
confession
had
made
her
understand
at
once
that
sentimentally
at
least
she
had
nothing
to
fear
from
him
john
rizzio
was
wise
in
the
ways
of
women
and
the
particular
woman
now
thrown
upon
his
mercy
even
though
she
was
the
one
woman
in
the
world
he
had
thought
the
most
desirable
was
to
be
treated
with
the
delicate
consideration
due
to
her
unfortunate
dependence
upon
him
a
flash
of
sentiment
a
breath
of
revelation
of
his
ultimate
purposes
toward
her
and
the
woman
would
be
lost
to
him
her
misfortunes
if
anything
had
made
her
more
desirable
than
ever
especially
since
he
had
been
the
cause
of
them
for
one
mad
moment
he
had
thought
this
morning
of
turning
the
toward
the
waters
of
the
south
atlantic
forgetting
the
quarrels
of
the
nations
in
which
he
had
become
involved
and
of
seeking
a
new
world
where
he
could
begin
again
trusting
to
time
and
opportunity
and
his
own
patience
and
tact
to
bring
a
sentimental
victory
out
of
what
had
already
been
defeat
a
mad
moment
but
a
tempting
one
but
the
time
was
not
yet
he
must
be
patient
with
hammersley
gone
he
straightened
and
slowly
strolled
forward
to
the
wireless
room
toward
evening
he
was
given
confirmation
of
the
wisdom
of
his
course
for
as
he
was
pacing
the
deck
aft
she
came
up
from
below
and
joined
him
she
was
looking
rather
white
but
she
smiled
at
him
brightly
and
matched
her
steps
to
his
i
was
lonely
below
she
said
you
don
t
mind
he
had
never
thought
her
lovelier
her
face
if
anything
had
always
needed
just
those
shadows
of
pain
to
make
it
perfect
i
hadn
t
hoped
for
such
a
kindness
you
are
feeling
better
yes
thanks
and
since
we
must
meet
i
am
willing
to
try
to
be
i
m
sure
you
ll
find
that
i
ll
meet
you
more
than
halfway
he
said
politely
they
talked
far
into
the
evening
and
at
her
request
they
dined
together
in
the
saloon
he
was
reserved
but
not
cautious
and
when
the
evening
was
over
remembered
hazily
that
she
had
succeeded
in
learning
something
from
him
of
general
von
stromberg
the
head
of
the
german
secret
service
department
of
the
aviation
field
at
windenberg
and
of
the
frequent
flights
of
the
yellow
dove
since
the
beginning
of
the
winter
the
next
morning
passed
quietly
doris
did
not
appear
until
noon
but
just
before
luncheon
a
smudge
of
smoke
appeared
upon
the
horizon
which
rapidly
grew
larger
and
in
a
little
while
she
made
out
the
lines
of
a
war
vessel
steaming
in
a
direction
which
would
intercept
the
yacht
the
did
not
slow
down
until
a
solid
shot
from
a
gun
in
the
forecastle
of
the
destroyer
went
ricochetting
across
her
bows
when
the
engine
was
stopped
and
john
rizzio
made
slowly
aft
to
where
she
stood
miss
mather
he
said
briefly
i
must
ask
you
to
go
below
to
your
cabin
at
a
glance
at
his
face
showed
that
her
protests
would
have
been
useless
and
she
went
below
to
her
own
stateroom
the
door
of
which
was
locked
upon
her
through
the
heavy
glass
of
her
she
saw
the
vessel
approach
until
within
hailing
distance
when
a
boat
dropped
from
her
side
into
which
a
boat
s
crew
and
an
officer
clambered
and
rowed
alongside
the
vessel
bore
no
flag
but
the
girl
clearly
heard
the
hail
of
the
boarding
officer
and
realized
that
the
destroyer
was
an
english
vessel
her
hopes
rose
perhaps
even
now
the
englishman
would
find
something
irregular
in
the
yacht
s
papers
and
would
take
charge
conveying
her
back
to
england
she
waited
for
a
long
time
and
then
heard
the
clatter
of
oars
and
saw
the
boat
push
off
from
the
side
of
the
yacht
while
the
officer
young
slender
and
windburned
stood
up
in
the
stern
sheets
of
his
boat
all
right
she
heard
him
say
sorry
to
have
troubled
you
pleasant
voyage
never
had
english
sounded
so
good
to
her
but
it
was
with
a
sigh
of
despair
that
she
saw
the
boat
reach
the
side
of
the
war
vessel
and
felt
the
steadily
increasing
rhythm
of
the
engines
of
the
yacht
as
she
drove
once
more
upon
her
way
when
the
two
vessels
were
at
a
distance
from
each
other
the
key
turned
in
the
lock
of
the
door
and
in
reply
to
a
knock
she
found
john
rizzio
himself
standing
hat
in
hand
in
the
gangway
i
seem
to
be
in
a
continual
state
of
apology
but
of
course
you
realize
the
necessity
for
my
i
am
in
your
power
she
said
helplessly
i
hope
you
will
believe
that
i
shall
not
abuse
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
followed
him
to
luncheon
managing
to
preserve
at
table
a
cheerfulness
which
she
was
far
from
feeling
throughout
the
morning
she
had
been
thinking
hard
and
the
only
course
that
was
open
to
her
if
her
courage
did
not
fail
was
the
one
that
she
was
following
if
she
was
to
be
able
in
any
way
to
help
cyril
she
must
try
to
learn
what
she
could
accept
the
situation
with
good
grace
and
perhaps
by
some
turn
of
good
fortune
find
a
way
to
disarm
john
rizzio
and
profit
by
an
inadvertence
or
mistake
but
as
the
second
day
wore
on
she
found
her
task
increasingly
difficult
at
luncheon
rizzio
was
more
reserved
and
during
the
afternoon
as
they
approached
waters
in
which
german
warships
were
more
likely
to
be
found
he
spent
much
time
in
the
wireless
room
where
a
repetition
of
the
crackling
noises
advised
her
that
he
was
again
in
communication
with
the
land
of
her
enemies
after
dinner
at
which
rizzio
had
been
very
quiet
he
requested
politely
that
she
go
at
once
to
her
cabin
which
she
did
to
hear
the
sound
of
the
key
again
turned
in
the
lock
of
her
door
despair
came
over
her
and
at
last
she
cried
herself
to
sleep
awakening
during
the
night
at
the
glare
of
a
searchlight
which
pierced
her
window
port
she
got
up
and
looked
out
to
see
a
dark
bulk
looming
alongside
the
flashing
of
lanterns
and
heard
the
sound
of
voices
speaking
german
at
last
all
was
quiet
again
and
the
steady
hammer
of
the
vessel
s
propeller
told
her
that
the
was
again
on
her
way
she
must
have
slept
again
for
the
silver
of
dawn
was
already
modifying
the
gloom
of
her
cabin
when
there
was
a
knock
upon
her
door
and
she
rose
the
stewardess
fully
dressed
was
outside
mr
rizzio
asks
me
to
request
you
to
please
dress
at
once
as
breakfast
will
be
served
in
half
an
she
obeyed
blindly
aware
that
there
was
no
motion
to
the
deck
of
her
cabin
and
that
the
was
now
riding
on
an
even
keel
she
verified
her
guess
at
the
nearness
of
their
destination
by
a
glance
through
the
which
showed
her
that
the
vessel
had
reached
the
quieter
waters
of
a
bay
or
river
in
which
she
slipped
smoothly
onward
there
were
vessels
at
anchor
large
and
small
and
beyond
them
she
made
out
the
lines
of
a
shore
upon
which
at
intervals
buildings
loomed
madden
the
stewardess
would
not
talk
and
it
was
not
until
she
reached
the
breakfast
table
that
doris
learned
where
they
were
we
shall
reach
bremen
shortly
said
rizzio
i
do
not
know
how
you
feel
about
the
matter
but
i
would
suggest
that
it
would
save
you
much
trouble
and
anxiety
to
trust
yourself
entirely
into
my
i
know
of
nothing
else
she
said
quietly
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
shall
confer
with
certain
officials
when
we
reach
the
city
which
will
be
in
a
few
moments
after
that
we
will
take
the
seven
o
clock
train
for
chapter
xiv
von
stromberg
catechises
to
the
girl
the
way
from
bremen
to
windenberg
seemed
interminable
she
shared
with
john
rizzio
a
private
compartment
in
the
train
he
was
still
ceremoniously
polite
and
inclined
to
conversation
but
now
thoroughly
realizing
the
danger
which
faced
her
as
well
as
cyril
doris
had
decided
upon
a
policy
of
silence
she
would
wait
until
she
learned
what
they
required
of
her
and
then
perhaps
some
instinct
or
inspiration
would
direct
her
of
one
thing
she
was
certain
that
nothing
could
make
her
speak
if
she
did
not
think
it
wise
to
do
so
when
rizzio
commented
upon
the
beauty
of
the
passing
landscape
she
assented
with
a
smile
and
then
returned
to
her
own
thoughts
cyril
she
knew
would
be
at
windenberg
for
it
was
to
windenberg
that
the
yellow
dove
had
made
its
flights
she
had
succeeded
in
eliciting
that
much
information
from
her
captor
the
other
night
at
dinner
when
he
was
attempting
by
frankness
and
hospitality
to
minimize
the
brutality
of
his
actions
she
had
many
reasons
to
believe
that
he
had
already
regretted
that
frankness
for
at
every
subsequent
attempt
of
hers
to
get
more
information
about
von
stromberg
john
rizzio
had
turned
the
subject
adroitly
or
had
remained
obstinately
silent
she
tried
to
put
together
the
scraps
of
information
she
possessed
in
order
to
understand
just
what
cyril
s
position
at
windenberg
might
be
he
had
answered
the
summons
of
the
secret
messenger
willingly
and
at
once
that
much
was
in
his
favor
if
they
had
suspected
him
before
this
immediate
obedience
must
have
disarmed
them
in
the
mind
of
general
von
stromberg
there
could
be
no
possible
reason
why
cyril
should
put
himself
at
his
mercy
general
von
stromberg
could
not
know
as
she
knew
that
cyril
had
another
mission
to
perform
she
looked
up
quickly
to
find
john
rizzio
s
dark
eyes
gazing
at
her
he
frightened
her
at
that
moment
for
it
almost
seemed
from
the
expression
of
his
face
that
he
had
succeeded
in
reading
her
thoughts
and
in
the
light
of
his
previous
omniscience
even
that
psychic
feat
seemed
within
the
realm
of
possibility
but
he
merely
smiled
at
her
and
looked
out
of
the
window
that
mission
of
cyril
s
what
was
it
the
obtaining
of
some
information
necessary
to
england
some
military
secret
such
as
the
machinery
of
ordnance
or
the
chemical
mixture
of
explosive
shells
or
was
it
something
more
personal
more
sinister
and
dreadful
the
death
of
some
high
official
perhaps
the
emperor
himself
she
shuddered
and
shut
her
eyes
her
mind
painting
unimaginable
horrors
not
murder
even
for
cyril
she
could
not
connive
at
that
but
she
must
be
prepared
to
do
something
for
him
to
help
him
if
she
could
by
false
testimony
or
if
necessary
no
matter
what
they
did
to
her
by
silence
if
they
suspected
cyril
of
course
he
would
be
kept
in
ignorance
of
her
arrival
of
all
these
things
and
others
she
thought
with
doubt
and
timidity
and
all
the
while
in
the
back
of
her
head
was
the
idea
of
her
possible
appeal
to
the
american
ambassador
at
berlin
but
if
she
had
any
hopes
that
an
opportunity
would
be
given
her
to
use
the
post
or
even
to
be
free
from
surveillance
their
arrival
at
windenberg
speedily
diminished
them
for
upon
the
platform
of
the
small
station
a
german
officer
met
them
and
conducted
them
at
once
to
a
closed
carriage
which
started
off
through
the
village
immediately
the
officer
and
rizzio
exchanged
a
few
commonplaces
which
politely
included
her
but
as
to
the
real
meaning
of
her
visit
and
their
possible
intentions
nothing
so
she
sank
back
in
her
seat
and
looked
out
through
a
small
window
at
the
forest
into
which
the
road
almost
immediately
passed
reaching
their
destination
in
apparent
calmness
the
high
tension
of
her
nerves
resolutely
schooled
to
obedience
a
farmhouse
in
the
midst
of
meadows
surrounded
by
forests
with
a
broad
hospitable
door
in
which
they
entered
seeing
no
one
the
german
officer
who
directed
them
showed
her
the
way
to
a
room
upstairs
and
when
she
was
in
the
room
locked
the
door
she
was
in
the
dark
for
the
shutters
of
the
windows
were
closed
her
first
impulse
at
reaching
a
haven
of
privacy
even
though
a
prison
was
to
seek
the
line
of
least
resistance
and
give
her
nerves
the
relaxation
they
needed
in
tears
but
she
fought
the
weakness
down
going
to
the
windows
and
peering
out
through
a
crack
in
the
shutters
when
she
tried
to
open
them
she
discovered
that
they
were
locked
or
nailed
from
the
outside
she
had
been
a
prisoner
she
knew
upon
the
yacht
but
the
firmness
with
which
the
hard
wood
and
iron
resisted
her
efforts
gave
her
for
the
first
time
the
grim
reality
of
her
predicament
a
prisoner
in
the
heart
of
a
german
forest
with
no
way
to
turn
for
help
where
was
cyril
perhaps
after
all
her
surmises
had
been
incorrect
they
had
sent
him
away
to
berlin
or
perhaps
he
had
gone
back
in
freedom
to
england
grave
fears
assailed
her
as
to
rizzio
and
his
intentions
once
a
friend
but
after
that
an
unsuccessful
lover
what
did
she
know
of
him
or
of
these
people
into
whose
hands
he
was
committing
her
germans
she
was
ready
to
believe
anything
of
them
after
belgium
the
worst
had
rizzio
s
story
about
bringing
her
to
the
head
of
the
secret
service
of
germany
been
a
mere
invention
to
serve
other
ends
he
had
told
her
at
kilmorack
house
that
he
would
never
give
her
up
was
this
what
he
had
meant
a
blind
terror
seized
her
which
seemed
for
the
moment
to
deaden
all
her
faculties
for
analysis
the
room
though
chill
seemed
to
stifle
her
its
walls
and
ceiling
to
be
closing
in
to
crush
her
she
stumbled
to
the
bed
upon
which
she
fell
and
lay
for
a
long
while
exhausted
and
at
last
the
blessing
of
tears
came
to
her
and
then
sleep
how
long
doris
slept
she
did
not
know
but
she
realized
that
it
could
not
have
been
long
for
strange
ugly
figures
came
into
her
dreams
and
strange
ugly
events
followed
each
other
with
lightning
swiftness
but
a
knock
upon
the
door
brought
her
back
to
the
terrors
of
her
predicament
and
she
answered
it
wondering
what
was
to
happen
it
was
a
tall
man
in
the
jÃ¤ger
uniform
bearing
a
tray
of
food
some
toast
eggs
and
a
cup
of
chocolate
he
entered
with
a
smile
and
a
polite
greeting
in
german
putting
the
tray
upon
the
table
and
then
forcing
open
the
shutters
a
little
so
that
a
narrow
bar
of
sunlight
came
into
the
room
and
lay
upon
the
bright
drugget
upon
the
floor
by
its
light
she
examined
the
man
he
was
tall
grizzled
at
the
temples
and
walked
with
a
slight
limp
he
smiled
at
her
again
and
she
could
not
refrain
from
answering
the
smile
in
kind
i
hope
the
frÃ¤ulein
will
enjoy
her
lunch
he
said
the
toast
especially
for
i
have
made
it
myself
i
trust
that
the
frÃ¤ulein
prefers
dry
thanks
anything
will
do
i
am
not
i
am
sorry
said
the
forester
bowing
and
then
continuing
in
a
lower
tone
the
frÃ¤ulein
will
not
forget
that
the
toast
is
excellent
and
that
i
made
it
she
examined
him
curiously
wondering
whether
he
were
not
perhaps
a
little
demented
but
at
the
door
he
bowed
and
disappeared
and
she
heard
the
key
turn
in
the
lock
he
was
apparently
not
too
demented
to
forget
that
she
was
a
prisoner
she
was
not
hungry
but
she
knew
that
she
must
eat
something
to
keep
up
her
strength
for
any
ordeal
that
was
in
store
for
her
so
she
drew
a
chair
to
the
table
and
sat
pouring
out
the
chocolate
in
the
cup
and
helping
herself
to
the
eggs
all
the
while
she
thought
of
the
strange
behavior
of
her
servitor
why
did
he
lay
such
stress
upon
the
excellence
of
the
dry
toast
and
why
because
it
was
dry
she
raised
a
piece
of
it
with
her
fingers
and
examined
it
lifted
the
second
piece
when
a
gasp
of
surprise
escaped
her
above
the
third
piece
of
toast
folded
neatly
was
a
thin
strip
of
paper
she
glanced
toward
the
door
and
window
and
then
getting
up
from
the
table
and
going
to
a
spot
where
observation
of
her
actions
was
impossible
opened
the
slip
of
paper
it
was
in
cyril
s
hand
don
t
be
frightened
she
read
you
are
to
be
questioned
follow
these
instructions
i
made
copy
of
message
in
heathcote
library
night
of
dinner
while
waiting
for
you
to
get
wraps
i
hid
it
in
right
sash
of
motor
copy
and
original
of
message
the
same
you
and
i
are
enemies
therefore
ignore
me
rizzio
acted
for
scotland
yard
as
to
the
rest
tell
truth
exactly
and
no
harm
can
come
to
me
i
will
find
means
later
to
communicate
burn
this
immediately
her
heart
beating
high
she
read
the
paper
through
twice
to
familiarize
herself
with
the
instructions
which
she
perfectly
understood
then
she
found
a
matchbox
on
the
candlestick
put
the
paper
in
the
hearth
and
burned
it
after
that
she
sat
at
the
table
and
ate
it
was
there
that
captain
von
winden
found
her
some
moments
later
when
he
came
to
request
her
presence
in
the
room
on
the
ground
floor
during
the
time
that
doris
slept
in
the
downstairs
general
von
stromberg
sat
with
john
rizzio
a
peaceful
winter
landscape
looked
in
at
the
windows
the
sun
slanted
in
a
yellow
rhomboid
upon
the
floor
a
cheerful
fire
was
burning
upon
the
hearth
and
general
von
stromberg
his
left
hand
tapping
gently
upon
the
back
of
his
right
was
gravely
listening
to
john
rizzio
s
story
all
of
the
pieces
of
the
little
game
were
upon
the
board
he
was
now
about
to
move
them
skillfully
from
one
square
to
another
until
only
one
piece
remained
and
that
one
piece
the
victor
in
all
such
games
was
himself
and
what
was
his
manner
went
on
von
stromberg
when
you
showed
your
credentials
he
was
surprised
very
much
surprised
and
i
think
and
what
arguments
did
you
use
to
make
him
give
the
packet
up
i
threatened
him
with
serious
which
meant
said
von
stromberg
grimly
yes
excellenz
but
he
refused
without
other
grounds
than
his
own
and
then
excellenz
frÃ¤ulein
mather
came
in
she
heard
something
from
behind
the
curtain
but
she
gave
no
oh
she
is
clever
exceptionally
so
i
have
brought
her
here
of
my
own
volition
and
she
will
speak
if
properly
approached
but
i
hope
excellenz
will
be
pleased
to
make
the
interview
as
easy
for
her
as
possible
if
any
harm
should
come
to
her
it
is
not
the
practice
of
my
department
to
do
hurt
to
women
said
the
general
quickly
then
he
laughed
i
suspect
herr
rizzio
that
you
have
a
tenderness
in
that
it
is
true
i
hope
therefore
that
you
will
be
patient
with
von
stromberg
waved
his
hand
impatiently
and
what
happened
then
hammersley
and
miss
mather
went
out
i
remained
in
the
and
then
telephoned
to
maxwell
to
send
his
men
at
once
they
came
i
met
them
outside
the
house
before
hammersley
emerged
and
gave
them
my
instructions
to
follow
hammersley
s
machine
and
get
the
the
older
man
started
forward
his
long
acquisitive
nose
eagerly
scenting
a
clue
and
how
long
was
it
after
they
left
the
for
the
machine
rizzio
pulled
at
his
mustache
a
moment
thoughtfully
i
could
not
say
exactly
he
said
after
a
time
a
matter
of
half
an
hour
did
you
know
what
herr
hammersley
was
doing
in
the
meanwhile
no
i
could
not
say
i
telephoned
first
and
then
went
out
the
guests
were
all
in
the
did
you
go
up
to
the
library
rizzio
showed
surprise
no
are
you
sure
that
herr
hammersley
was
in
the
with
the
others
when
you
went
out
yes
excellenz
i
am
sure
of
it
there
was
no
reason
for
him
to
be
anywhere
there
was
no
chance
of
his
going
upstairs
to
the
library
for
ten
fifteen
minutes
without
your
seeing
him
rizzio
straightened
and
pulled
at
his
mustache
excellenz
i
think
i
understand
the
object
of
your
questions
it
is
not
possible
that
herr
hammersley
could
have
made
a
copy
of
the
papers
at
lady
heathcote
s
von
stromberg
paused
a
moment
then
he
asked
how
long
after
you
left
the
door
of
the
house
before
he
came
out
with
the
lady
scarcely
more
than
ten
the
general
s
fingers
tapped
more
rapidly
oh
he
growled
i
and
then
tell
me
how
the
matter
was
arranged
that
captain
byfield
should
deliver
those
maxwell
managed
it
through
a
cipher
the
war
office
had
grown
suspicious
and
all
the
usual
channels
were
closed
byfield
was
frightened
and
refused
to
deliver
further
messages
so
maxwell
hit
upon
the
scheme
of
the
cigarette
papers
to
be
delivered
to
hammersley
i
could
not
receive
them
from
byfield
because
of
your
instructions
not
to
let
my
interests
be
known
to
anyone
in
england
but
maxwell
you
thought
the
time
was
not
ripe
for
me
to
play
my
yes
said
von
stromberg
dryly
but
the
time
is
ripe
now
and
you
are
not
there
to
play
but
this
affair
was
of
such
importance
yes
yes
the
general
broke
in
quickly
go
it
was
the
day
of
an
anniversary
always
celebrated
for
me
by
lady
heathcote
whose
house
as
you
know
is
one
of
the
most
exclusive
in
england
and
above
suspicion
i
invited
the
guests
and
maxwell
communicated
with
hammersley
arranging
the
manner
of
the
exchange
which
was
accomplished
my
demand
upon
hammersley
was
made
in
accordance
with
your
orders
it
was
a
test
of
his
loyalty
he
do
you
think
he
had
an
opportunity
to
glance
at
the
papers
i
mean
between
the
time
he
received
them
and
the
time
of
your
demand
of
him
yes
he
studied
them
for
a
moment
behind
the
curtains
of
an
alcove
in
the
i
was
watching
i
saw
his
shadow
as
he
bent
over
to
the
light
of
the
by
that
you
mean
he
had
a
hope
that
they
might
be
spurious
yes
excellenz
when
it
was
discovered
that
there
was
a
leak
false
orders
were
issued
to
test
the
different
departments
of
the
war
h
and
then
maxwell
s
men
followed
him
and
when
he
was
on
the
point
of
capture
he
turned
the
papers
over
to
the
lady
who
escaped
through
the
hedge
as
i
have
said
before
excellenz
the
lady
is
clever
she
read
the
papers
but
her
loyalty
to
hammersley
kept
her
silent
though
at
that
time
she
suspected
that
he
was
a
german
i
see
said
von
stromberg
manifesting
a
sudden
activity
with
his
fingers
the
lady
is
interested
in
herr
hammersley
yes
more
interested
in
him
perhaps
than
she
is
in
you
rizzio
bowed
in
silence
said
von
stromberg
rising
that
perhaps
makes
matters
more
amusing
for
us
perhaps
a
little
more
amusing
for
herr
he
paced
the
floor
with
long
strides
while
rizzio
watched
him
until
he
stopped
before
the
fire
and
spoke
again
herr
rizzio
you
have
told
me
about
the
events
in
scotland
when
as
you
say
hammersley
acting
as
an
englishman
warned
the
lady
against
you
as
an
agent
of
germany
what
i
would
like
very
much
to
know
is
why
when
you
were
sure
he
was
acting
for
england
you
did
not
have
him
killed
at
i
tried
excellenz
but
he
was
too
well
prepared
for
me
my
men
shot
at
him
on
the
road
and
wounded
him
slightly
but
on
the
cliffs
at
he
had
a
confederate
who
killed
one
of
my
men
the
other
as
i
have
related
fell
over
the
but
you
put
in
the
officer
harshly
what
were
doing
all
the
while
i
shot
at
him
and
that
was
unfortunate
from
our
point
of
view
it
is
not
the
custom
of
agents
of
my
department
to
miss
at
anything
herr
rizzio
but
since
hammersley
is
here
the
damage
if
damage
there
is
can
be
repaired
what
did
you
do
after
that
i
had
reason
to
suspect
that
hammersley
was
the
cause
of
the
arrest
of
captain
byfield
i
had
also
reason
to
suspect
that
he
had
informed
or
would
inform
the
war
office
as
to
my
connection
with
germany
accordingly
i
had
made
arrangements
to
have
my
boat
within
easy
reaching
distance
of
with
the
help
of
two
other
men
who
had
been
set
to
watch
the
roads
in
case
of
surprises
i
kept
watch
on
hammersley
miss
mather
we
lost
in
the
darkness
of
the
moor
this
was
unfortunate
as
i
had
planned
to
take
her
too
but
we
followed
hammersley
on
horses
to
rudha
mor
to
be
sure
that
he
would
obey
your
summons
and
fortune
aided
us
for
doris
mather
had
followed
him
too
and
we
managed
to
take
her
without
difficulty
and
brought
her
aboard
the
yacht
hammersley
s
departure
for
germany
of
course
relieved
me
of
all
responsibility
on
his
von
stromberg
paused
before
the
fireplace
his
brows
puckering
on
the
whole
herr
rizzio
you
have
done
well
i
shall
not
complain
but
if
your
story
is
true
i
should
like
you
to
tell
me
two
things
the
first
is
why
should
herr
hammersley
return
to
germany
to
face
certain
death
at
my
hands
rizzio
shrugged
his
fine
shoulders
excellenz
i
do
not
know
i
did
not
think
he
would
come
when
i
sent
you
my
request
to
summon
him
the
knowledge
he
possessed
was
dangerous
to
me
and
i
had
made
every
possible
plan
to
kill
him
at
rudha
mor
nothing
that
could
have
happened
surprised
me
more
than
when
i
saw
him
fly
out
in
obedience
to
your
message
it
has
puzzled
me
i
do
not
know
why
he
came
unless
it
was
to
learn
something
in
germany
and
return
to
von
stromberg
gave
a
dry
chuckle
the
supposition
does
not
flatter
his
intelligence
or
mine
aside
from
the
difficulties
of
his
position
at
present
if
he
were
seeking
information
as
to
the
plans
of
the
empire
he
would
have
about
as
much
chance
of
getting
away
from
here
alive
as
you
would
have
herr
rizzio
in
the
same
the
old
man
towered
to
his
full
height
and
brought
his
huge
fist
down
with
a
crash
upon
the
table
which
startled
rizzio
who
fingered
his
mustache
his
face
a
shade
paler
i
am
glad
excellenz
he
said
with
a
laugh
that
i
am
not
in
hammersley
s
disregarding
rizzio
s
comment
the
old
man
paced
the
floor
again
storming
the
other
question
that
i
would
like
to
ask
you
is
what
has
become
of
herr
maxwell
rizzio
started
up
now
in
genuine
concern
have
you
not
heard
from
him
excellenz
no
roared
the
other
why
haven
t
i
you
should
i
do
not
know
i
saw
him
the
day
i
left
london
for
scotland
he
was
fully
informed
of
all
that
had
happened
could
it
be
that
rizzio
paused
with
a
deep
frown
where
is
he
why
has
he
not
reported
could
anything
have
happened
to
him
what
were
you
thinking
that
hammersley
perhaps
but
that
could
hardly
be
since
he
always
moved
under
cover
lieber
jesu
speak
out
will
you
i
thought
that
hammersley
might
have
been
the
cause
of
his
oh
you
think
that
why
because
it
was
hammersley
who
told
the
war
office
of
byfield
what
proof
have
you
of
that
no
one
knew
of
byfield
s
connection
with
us
but
hammersley
maxwell
and
those
were
my
orders
how
do
i
know
that
they
were
obeyed
one
doesn
t
disobey
orders
excellenz
with
one
s
head
in
a
h
there
are
many
necks
in
nooses
at
windenberg
and
one
of
the
nooses
will
be
he
had
stopped
before
rizzio
and
was
scowling
at
him
with
eyes
that
shot
malevolence
rizzio
knew
something
of
von
stromberg
s
methods
and
was
sure
that
he
was
merely
trying
to
intimidate
him
to
reduce
him
to
a
consistency
which
would
reveal
hidden
weaknesses
in
texture
yet
knowing
this
rizzio
felt
most
uncomfortable
he
twirled
his
mustache
and
looked
out
of
the
window
but
his
glance
came
back
to
von
stromberg
s
eyes
which
never
wavered
or
changed
in
intensity
as
though
under
the
influence
of
some
strange
hypnotic
attraction
you
know
of
course
the
old
man
s
harsh
voice
snapped
at
him
what
herr
hammersley
accuses
you
of
i
can
imagine
he
says
that
you
have
been
acting
for
the
english
rizzio
started
up
in
alarm
you
do
not
for
a
moment
believe
don
t
get
excited
i
believe
nothing
which
i
do
not
wish
to
believe
but
he
tells
a
very
pretty
story
herr
he
would
said
rizzio
easily
i
will
do
him
the
credit
of
saying
that
he
is
skillful
but
a
lie
will
discover
itself
in
the
exactly
i
am
glad
you
agree
with
me
what
i
now
propose
to
do
is
to
set
the
lie
in
motion
the
easiest
way
to
provoke
a
liar
is
to
put
him
upon
the
defensive
you
and
hammersley
shall
debate
the
matter
i
shall
be
the
judge
of
the
debate
we
shall
see
what
we
shall
he
strode
to
the
table
and
was
about
to
touch
the
bell
when
rizzio
broke
in
one
moment
excellenz
i
should
like
to
know
on
what
he
bases
his
humph
not
weakening
rizzio
hardly
excellenz
the
other
smiled
it
will
not
be
difficult
for
me
to
verify
my
statements
if
hammersley
will
only
you
need
not
fear
he
will
what
i
wanted
to
know
excellenz
was
the
nature
of
the
information
received
in
the
yellow
packet
would
you
permit
not
yet
herr
rizzio
not
yet
the
contents
of
the
message
will
come
in
time
for
the
present
there
is
quite
enough
to
occupy
herr
hammersley
s
mind
and
rizzio
shrugged
as
you
please
i
would
like
to
know
however
before
you
summon
him
whether
his
accusation
is
based
on
my
attempt
upon
his
von
stromberg
chuckled
is
not
that
enough
to
prejudice
a
man
if
he
were
honest
yes
if
he
were
honest
said
rizzio
did
he
have
any
authority
for
his
belief
yes
herr
rizzio
said
the
general
fixing
rizzio
with
his
stare
he
told
me
that
maxwell
had
learned
it
from
byfield
rizzio
started
forward
quickly
hammersley
is
a
fool
have
i
not
told
excellenz
that
byfield
knew
nothing
whatever
of
my
connection
with
the
affair
von
stromberg
stretched
his
long
arms
impatiently
herr
maxwell
unfortunately
is
silent
captain
byfield
is
in
a
position
where
the
only
questions
that
can
be
put
to
him
will
be
those
at
the
gates
of
heaven
by
his
he
gave
the
bell
on
the
table
a
resounding
blow
and
grinned
mischievously
at
rizzio
you
say
that
herr
hammersley
is
a
fool
he
asserts
that
you
are
one
i
shall
now
smoke
a
cigar
and
decide
for
myself
which
of
you
is
and
as
the
soldier
entered
tell
herr
hammersley
that
i
wish
to
see
him
here
at
i
can
only
say
excellenz
said
rizzio
when
the
man
went
out
that
i
am
willing
to
abide
by
your
even
though
it
should
be
unfavorable
to
yourself
growled
von
stromberg
that
excellenz
is
quite
i
have
known
stranger
things
to
happen
the
worst
aspect
of
your
case
is
that
herr
hammersley
is
here
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
come
you
yourself
admit
that
he
had
only
to
stay
in
england
to
devote
his
talents
to
a
more
congenial
von
stromberg
puffed
on
his
cigar
and
leaned
across
the
table
can
you
tell
me
why
herr
hammersley
came
to
germany
answer
me
correctly
rizzio
and
i
will
give
you
every
masterpiece
in
rizzio
frowned
into
the
fire
i
can
not
say
he
replied
i
have
admitted
that
he
has
puzzled
me
i
can
only
think
of
one
thing
hammersley
is
a
type
of
man
who
under
the
guise
of
inefficiency
does
all
things
well
he
is
a
sportsman
he
would
do
such
a
thing
for
the
love
of
adventure
because
the
danger
the
excitement
appealed
to
him
because
it
was
the
sporting
a
reason
rizzio
muttered
von
stromberg
but
not
the
real
rizzio
started
and
a
smile
broke
at
the
corners
of
his
lips
oh
you
realize
then
that
there
is
something
else
something
he
paused
i
realize
nothing
growled
the
general
realization
rizzio
is
the
one
banality
of
existence
uncertainty
is
the
only
thing
worth
while
when
one
is
certain
of
anything
it
ceases
to
be
interesting
that
is
why
herr
hammersley
whom
you
call
a
fool
in
one
breath
and
a
genius
in
the
next
excites
my
profound
attention
come
i
think
you
will
agree
with
me
that
he
is
worth
i
do
not
like
hammersley
but
that
need
not
prevent
your
interest
in
him
even
though
your
interest
is
largely
in
his
the
phrase
was
significant
delivered
significantly
and
in
spite
of
himself
rizzio
felt
the
gaze
of
the
general
piercing
his
veneer
i
could
feel
no
happiness
in
such
a
misfortune
he
said
gravely
notwithstanding
my
dislike
of
a
knock
at
the
door
interrupted
further
conversation
and
at
a
command
from
the
general
hammersley
entered
chapter
xv
the
inquisition
if
general
von
stromberg
had
counted
upon
playing
a
trump
card
in
producing
rizzio
at
this
interview
herr
hammersley
s
demeanor
must
have
disappointed
him
for
he
entered
the
room
with
cheerful
composure
noted
rizzio
stared
at
him
in
sudden
seriousness
and
then
turned
to
von
stromberg
with
the
air
of
a
man
briskly
intent
you
wanted
to
see
me
excellenz
he
asked
quietly
he
had
evinced
a
mild
surprise
at
rizzio
s
presence
but
no
discomposure
if
anything
his
manner
now
had
a
kind
of
sober
eagerness
as
at
the
imminence
of
an
issue
in
which
a
necessary
if
painful
duty
must
be
performed
general
von
stromberg
from
his
armchair
regarded
him
through
a
cloud
of
tobacco
smoke
yes
herr
hammersley
said
von
stromberg
as
you
will
observe
herr
rizzio
has
just
arrived
from
england
he
followed
you
almost
immediately
upon
his
yacht
it
is
most
fortunate
that
he
is
here
for
there
are
several
matters
which
we
can
discuss
in
privacy
i
am
at
your
service
excellenz
said
hammersley
if
there
are
any
facts
which
i
can
add
to
my
report
i
shall
be
his
idiom
was
hanoverian
rizzio
quite
cool
faced
him
upright
with
folded
arms
to
begin
with
we
will
sit
to
stand
is
the
attitude
of
discomposure
one
thinks
more
calmly
sitting
down
you
have
my
permission
so
now
we
will
proceed
i
will
outline
in
the
briefest
words
the
situation
herr
hammersley
an
agent
of
the
secret
service
department
of
the
imperial
government
is
intrusted
with
the
receipt
and
delivery
of
certain
secret
messages
he
receives
them
but
is
requested
by
herr
rizzio
also
an
agent
of
the
secret
service
department
of
the
imperial
government
on
authority
of
indubitable
credentials
to
relinquish
the
message
to
herr
rizzio
it
is
not
necessary
to
state
the
reasons
of
the
imperial
secret
service
department
in
desiring
the
transfer
of
this
message
it
is
sufficient
that
herr
hammersley
refused
to
obey
the
orders
he
has
given
explanations
which
on
their
face
seem
adequate
upon
the
side
of
herr
rizzio
it
may
be
said
that
failing
in
his
object
he
came
to
a
certain
conclusion
most
unflattering
to
the
loyalty
of
herr
hammersley
we
will
now
proceed
in
orderly
fashion
to
hear
the
cause
of
herr
hammersley
s
refusal
and
the
subsequent
acts
of
herr
rizzio
which
have
created
so
great
a
misunderstanding
herr
hammersley
you
will
tell
us
the
facts
as
you
have
related
i
learned
from
herr
maxwell
that
herr
rizzio
was
playing
a
double
game
captain
byfield
had
furnished
him
with
full
proofs
of
it
one
of
which
was
a
letter
he
had
seen
from
herr
rizzio
to
a
military
officer
high
in
the
councils
of
the
war
office
this
was
an
additional
reason
excellenz
why
herr
maxwell
arranged
with
captain
byfield
that
the
cigarette
papers
should
be
delivered
to
rizzio
leaned
quickly
forward
his
face
dark
with
passion
excellenz
he
began
that
could
not
possibly
be
true
the
real
reason
for
the
delivery
of
the
message
to
herr
hammersley
excellenz
well
knows
and
herr
maxwell
would
hardly
send
men
to
follow
herr
hammersley
at
my
request
if
he
disbelieved
in
my
quite
so
he
would
not
and
did
not
said
hammersley
the
men
were
not
herr
maxwell
s
they
were
men
of
scotland
yard
it
is
quite
obvious
by
the
way
they
bungled
the
general
smiled
delightedly
it
was
the
sort
of
joke
he
liked
that
is
one
point
in
your
favor
rizzio
shrugged
excellenz
well
knows
he
said
why
those
men
were
sent
they
had
instructions
to
get
the
papers
for
that
is
strange
said
hammersley
if
maxwell
had
asked
me
personally
for
the
papers
i
should
have
given
them
to
him
maxwell
would
have
known
better
than
to
intrust
those
papers
to
a
third
person
it
is
not
likely
that
i
should
have
given
them
up
to
any
man
even
if
maxwell
had
sent
it
is
unfortunate
that
herr
maxwell
is
not
here
to
one
moment
herr
rizzio
broke
in
the
general
then
to
hammersley
what
was
the
nature
of
the
letter
which
you
say
was
sent
by
herr
rizzio
to
a
high
official
of
the
war
office
it
was
a
statement
in
regard
to
the
case
of
carl
hÃ¼ber
who
as
you
know
was
shot
last
week
in
the
tower
of
von
stromberg
frowned
we
are
killing
our
evidence
too
fast
a
little
too
fast
for
convenience
we
will
kill
no
more
german
agents
in
the
tower
until
they
have
had
an
opportunity
to
hammersley
smiled
unfortunately
excellenz
i
have
no
means
of
restoring
him
to
life
he
said
he
was
an
excellent
man
and
leaves
i
believe
a
wife
and
six
von
stromberg
tapped
his
fingers
slowly
we
will
go
on
if
you
please
with
the
discussion
of
the
general
facts
you
claim
that
herr
maxwell
distrusting
rizzio
arranged
that
the
papers
should
be
handed
from
captain
byfield
to
you
i
have
told
you
that
maxwell
had
orders
from
me
to
put
you
to
this
test
pardon
excellenz
i
did
not
know
that
at
the
time
i
only
know
that
herr
maxwell
chose
to
disregard
your
orders
to
him
and
rizzio
instructing
me
not
to
deliver
the
papers
to
rizzio
under
any
when
did
herr
maxwell
make
the
discovery
of
herr
rizzio
s
er
treachery
it
was
the
evening
of
lady
heathcote
s
dinner
captain
byfield
had
learned
the
truth
that
one
moment
rizzio
rose
his
face
pale
with
anger
it
is
easy
to
manufacture
evidence
of
this
kind
where
both
of
the
witnesses
mentioned
are
beyond
reach
i
will
not
even
deny
the
truth
of
their
charges
they
are
too
absurd
if
i
was
acting
for
england
will
herr
hammersley
tell
me
why
the
agents
of
scotland
yard
whom
he
says
i
sent
for
did
not
surround
the
house
at
ashwater
park
and
boldly
demand
the
papers
from
miss
mather
in
the
name
of
the
government
and
the
law
the
reasons
are
obvious
replied
hammersley
i
will
give
herr
rizzio
the
credit
for
that
much
delicacy
if
his
men
had
found
the
papers
at
ashwater
park
frÃ¤ulein
mather
whom
herr
rizzio
esteems
most
highly
and
who
was
quite
innocent
would
have
eventually
been
imprisoned
by
the
government
as
a
spy
at
his
orders
the
house
was
therefore
secretly
searched
by
night
i
am
happy
to
say
unsuccessfully
herr
rizzio
will
surely
not
deny
the
kindness
of
his
motives
upon
that
occasion
excellenz
will
take
that
reply
for
what
it
is
worth
scotland
yard
has
never
permitted
sentimental
considerations
to
interfere
with
the
performance
of
its
hammersley
went
on
stolidly
i
can
not
conceive
of
any
agents
of
germany
attempting
to
kill
me
this
my
pursuers
did
at
saltham
rocks
and
again
in
the
person
of
rizzio
himself
on
the
cliffs
at
beaufort
head
even
excellenz
hammersley
leaned
forward
smiling
blandly
even
after
he
knew
that
i
had
met
captain
stammer
and
conveyed
my
acceptance
of
excellenz
s
invitation
to
return
to
i
was
not
sure
that
he
would
if
not
for
any
other
reasons
excellenz
the
pursuit
of
the
agents
of
scotland
yard
would
have
been
sufficient
fortunately
however
i
had
intended
going
as
the
bearer
of
the
byfield
message
and
i
carried
it
you
can
t
deny
he
brought
a
message
excellenz
put
in
rizzio
quickly
but
what
message
there
were
two
messages
one
prepared
by
captain
byfield
the
other
prepared
by
i
do
not
deny
that
when
i
discovered
that
i
was
likely
to
have
an
interesting
evening
i
made
a
copy
of
the
papers
in
a
package
of
which
i
had
in
my
rizzio
broke
in
quickly
that
copy
was
made
not
at
lady
heathcote
s
that
night
but
at
the
war
office
or
elsewhere
the
following
day
it
was
prepared
for
the
emergency
of
capture
and
escaping
that
for
delivery
to
general
von
general
von
stromberg
has
been
told
about
those
papers
i
have
told
him
where
and
when
i
made
the
and
where
was
that
asked
rizzio
keenly
in
the
library
at
lady
heathcote
s
while
you
were
telephoning
to
scotland
rizzio
struggled
for
control
and
then
with
dignity
to
von
stromberg
i
was
telephoning
to
herr
maxwell
he
turned
to
hammersley
with
a
confident
smile
assuming
for
the
moment
that
what
you
say
about
copying
the
papers
is
true
what
did
you
do
with
the
copy
i
took
it
out
to
the
motor
where
i
slipped
it
down
the
window
sash
hammersley
laughed
surely
rizzio
the
tall
man
from
scotland
yard
must
have
told
you
that
when
i
escaped
i
shouted
to
him
that
he
had
not
searched
the
general
von
stromberg
broke
in
suddenly
why
did
you
say
that
hammersley
shrugged
i
had
injured
their
motor
and
i
knew
that
i
should
escape
the
bravado
of
triumph
excellenz
i
was
rather
happy
for
as
a
fact
they
had
given
me
an
uncomfortable
rizzio
leaned
across
the
table
excellenz
it
was
to
draw
attention
from
the
girl
who
had
the
original
message
and
who
had
concealed
herself
in
a
general
von
stromberg
took
a
small
object
from
his
pocket
and
weighed
it
lightly
in
the
fingers
of
one
hand
it
was
the
package
of
as
hammersley
was
about
to
speak
he
held
up
the
other
hand
in
demand
for
silence
we
are
not
getting
very
far
he
said
both
of
you
tell
excellent
stories
of
your
adventures
worthy
of
the
best
traditions
of
the
secret
service
department
if
as
herr
rizzio
alleges
herr
hammersley
has
substituted
other
papers
for
the
original
ones
burned
by
miss
doris
mather
herr
hammersley
will
be
shot
if
as
herr
hammersley
alleges
herr
rizzio
was
in
communication
with
scotland
yard
the
officers
of
which
attempted
the
life
of
herr
hammersley
while
he
bore
dispatches
for
me
herr
rizzio
will
be
shot
it
is
a
very
delicate
matter
one
which
will
require
much
thought
since
the
one
man
who
could
settle
the
question
is
in
an
english
hammersley
started
a
pace
forward
oh
then
he
taken
rizzio
glanced
quickly
at
hammersley
excellenz
the
same
person
who
caused
the
arrest
of
captain
byfield
gave
maxwell
to
the
von
stromberg
s
gaze
followed
rizzio
s
to
hammersley
and
you
herr
hammersley
what
do
you
suggest
if
the
report
is
true
excellenz
i
quite
agree
with
herr
rizzio
he
said
easily
von
stromberg
showed
his
teeth
in
a
wolfish
smile
and
each
of
you
contends
that
it
was
the
other
hammersley
merely
nodded
but
rizzio
was
by
this
time
in
a
state
which
made
an
impossibility
excellenz
he
cried
hotly
is
it
conceivable
that
i
should
have
come
to
germany
if
i
had
been
guilty
of
the
crime
of
which
this
man
accuses
me
i
have
served
germany
against
you
forget
herr
rizzio
said
the
general
blandly
that
herr
hammersley
has
also
come
to
and
while
he
is
here
germany
is
in
danger
he
is
a
spy
of
england
hammersley
only
laughed
if
i
had
been
a
spy
of
england
excellenz
i
surely
had
many
chances
to
serve
england
s
cause
why
should
i
have
even
met
captain
stammer
at
beaufort
cove
it
would
have
been
quite
easy
to
have
informed
the
artillery
officer
at
innerwick
and
blown
his
destroyer
out
of
the
water
while
she
lay
at
anchor
herr
rizzio
forgets
that
honesty
is
always
provided
with
proof
in
reply
to
this
accusation
i
would
ask
herr
rizzio
how
he
managed
to
pass
through
the
cordon
of
british
destroyers
which
guard
the
coast
rizzio
hesitated
and
von
stromberg
spoke
that
is
a
fair
question
i
had
english
papers
as
well
as
german
i
came
away
before
the
war
office
had
time
to
act
upon
herr
hammersley
s
information
as
to
my
services
to
hammersley
shrugged
i
make
no
von
stromberg
frowned
at
the
opposite
wall
snapping
the
papers
of
the
package
in
his
fingers
impatiently
an
i
suspected
as
much
we
will
now
resort
to
other
means
the
only
possible
solution
of
this
case
barring
the
unpleasant
alternative
of
shooting
both
of
you
gentlemen
in
the
garden
this
afternoon
lies
in
the
nature
of
the
dispatches
themselves
and
in
the
production
of
a
material
he
brought
his
broad
palm
down
on
the
bell
upon
the
table
and
said
to
captain
von
winden
who
answered
it
you
will
bring
frÃ¤ulein
doris
mather
down
to
this
room
at
as
captain
von
winden
went
out
the
eyes
of
both
men
were
turned
to
hammersley
he
started
in
surprise
and
leaned
forward
toward
von
stromberg
slowly
turning
with
a
frown
to
rizzio
doris
miss
mather
here
he
muttered
she
came
with
with
herr
rizzio
von
stromberg
nodded
herr
rizzio
persuaded
her
to
come
with
persuaded
it
is
he
rose
and
took
a
pace
toward
rizzio
what
could
have
been
his
object
i
do
not
understand
it
will
be
very
cruel
for
her
to
to
see
me
since
she
knows
that
i
am
an
enemy
of
england
excellenz
she
it
was
who
read
the
papers
and
burned
them
if
herr
rizzio
supposes
that
frÃ¤ulein
mather
s
evidence
will
he
paused
his
brow
knitting
in
thought
her
evidence
is
important
said
von
stromberg
under
the
circumstances
you
should
be
glad
to
have
such
an
enemy
to
testify
against
you
sit
down
herr
hammersley
i
regret
that
the
necessities
of
the
case
require
this
hammersley
sat
and
frowning
at
the
wall
opposite
folded
his
arms
i
am
at
your
orders
excellenz
i
need
not
remind
you
that
she
will
tell
the
that
said
von
stromberg
with
a
wide
wave
of
the
hand
is
precisely
what
we
are
here
there
was
a
silence
grim
and
amusing
on
von
stromberg
s
part
on
rizzio
s
hammersley
still
sat
staring
at
the
wall
thoughtful
and
apparently
in
no
great
enjoyment
of
the
prospect
when
the
door
opened
and
doris
mather
entered
the
three
men
rose
her
face
was
pale
and
lines
of
care
were
at
her
eyes
and
lips
but
there
was
no
denying
the
proud
poise
of
her
head
the
firmness
of
her
mouth
and
the
steady
look
from
her
eyes
as
her
glance
passed
rizzio
and
hammersley
and
sought
the
figure
of
the
man
in
uniform
she
measured
him
with
a
look
that
neglected
nothing
her
gaze
finally
meeting
the
dark
shadow
under
the
gray
thatch
of
brows
where
his
small
eyes
gleamed
at
her
the
general
bowed
clicked
his
heels
together
and
brought
forward
a
chair
which
he
indicated
with
a
polite
gesture
i
offer
apologies
frÃ¤ulein
for
the
unfortunate
situation
in
which
destiny
has
placed
you
he
said
in
excellent
english
will
you
be
seated
the
girl
sat
and
faced
him
her
gaze
still
fixed
upon
his
face
it
was
as
though
she
meant
to
ignore
the
presence
of
the
other
two
men
general
von
stromberg
stared
at
her
for
a
moment
in
silence
and
then
finding
that
his
frown
was
only
met
by
a
look
of
calm
inquiry
smiled
at
her
instead
you
know
of
course
frÃ¤ulein
the
situation
with
which
you
are
confronted
herr
rizzio
has
brought
you
to
germany
to
shed
what
light
you
can
upon
the
mystery
of
these
cigarette
papers
herr
hammersley
says
that
herr
rizzio
has
been
acting
as
an
agent
of
the
english
government
while
professedly
in
the
service
of
germany
herr
rizzio
says
that
herr
hammersley
is
an
english
spy
your
position
is
a
difficult
one
but
circumstances
have
woven
you
into
a
piece
of
international
politics
your
testimony
is
of
the
utmost
importance
to
one
perhaps
both
of
these
i
i
will
do
what
i
can
to
enlighten
you
she
said
haltingly
what
do
you
wish
to
know
general
von
stromberg
beamed
on
her
i
am
glad
you
take
the
sensible
view
of
he
waved
the
package
of
cigarette
papers
in
his
fingers
you
have
seen
this
object
before
yes
i
think
so
will
you
let
me
look
at
it
the
general
moved
his
chair
closer
and
put
the
papers
in
her
fingers
she
opened
the
papers
and
finding
the
message
scanned
it
closely
reading
the
writing
with
deliberateness
and
then
looking
up
into
von
stromberg
s
face
you
have
seen
this
before
where
at
lady
heathcote
s
house
in
how
did
it
come
into
your
hands
i
found
it
on
the
floor
of
hammersley
s
the
night
herr
rizzio
entered
it
thinking
it
was
yours
yes
that
was
the
you
are
quite
sure
how
did
you
identify
it
by
certain
peculiar
characteristics
of
the
handwriting
with
which
i
am
mr
hammersley
s
is
it
not
and
how
did
this
package
of
papers
go
out
of
your
possession
mr
hammersley
took
them
from
by
force
she
raised
her
chin
proudly
and
looked
at
her
questioner
and
then
lowered
her
eyes
replying
quietly
there
was
another
package
of
cigarette
papers
of
the
same
make
as
these
there
you
read
them
i
was
this
before
or
after
you
found
the
second
package
these
which
i
now
have
in
my
hand
how
long
before
it
was
the
night
of
lady
heathcote
s
dinner
in
london
the
night
hammersley
took
me
home
in
the
the
night
you
were
followed
by
men
in
another
machine
you
escaped
to
ashwater
park
with
the
package
of
papers
which
herr
hammersley
had
given
you
and
after
hiding
in
a
tree
in
the
privacy
of
your
room
read
these
papers
i
were
the
contents
of
the
papers
you
read
at
ashwater
park
the
same
as
those
you
hold
in
your
hand
as
nearly
as
i
can
remember
they
were
word
for
word
i
can
not
say
that
there
were
certain
names
and
certain
figures
that
i
remember
very
clearly
as
being
exactly
the
same
i
i
she
hesitated
there
were
reasons
why
in
the
state
of
mind
that
i
was
in
what
i
saw
remained
impressed
upon
my
hammersley
throughout
had
sat
immovable
but
rizzio
who
had
shown
signs
of
anxiety
now
interrupted
excellenz
i
beg
von
stromberg
silenced
him
with
a
gesture
if
you
will
be
pleased
to
continue
frÃ¤ulein
do
you
remember
the
numerals
some
of
and
the
towns
and
dates
some
of
and
are
they
the
ones
that
you
remember
identical
in
both
packets
as
far
as
i
can
von
stromberg
took
the
packet
from
her
hands
and
turned
it
over
in
his
fingers
there
is
nothing
about
this
packet
no
distinguishing
mark
that
would
make
it
different
from
the
other
the
one
that
was
burned
none
except
the
general
von
stromberg
put
the
packet
into
an
inside
pocket
and
buttoned
his
coat
carefully
so
far
so
good
you
are
an
intelligent
witness
thank
if
the
words
of
her
questioner
contained
an
ulterior
suggestion
the
girl
gave
every
indication
of
being
oblivious
to
it
listening
with
a
grave
calmness
to
his
next
question
when
you
escaped
into
the
tree
were
you
in
a
position
to
hear
what
went
on
in
the
road
i
the
men
in
the
road
searched
herr
hammersley
they
and
at
last
he
escaped
do
you
remember
hearing
him
shout
anything
as
his
motor
moved
away
what
was
it
that
they
hadn
t
searched
the
machine
or
words
to
that
von
stromberg
glanced
at
rizzio
who
was
leaning
forward
in
his
chair
eager
to
speak
well
herr
rizzio
he
asked
that
was
a
diversion
intended
to
give
miss
mather
more
time
in
which
to
escape
the
second
package
was
not
in
the
motor
at
that
time
there
was
no
second
doris
mather
s
voice
was
raised
just
a
trifle
but
for
the
moment
it
dominated
there
was
hammersley
put
it
into
the
window
sash
when
he
was
in
danger
of
then
why
didn
t
he
put
them
both
there
i
suppose
because
he
wanted
to
be
sure
that
one
of
them
would
reach
its
von
stromberg
grunted
i
see
but
why
did
you
help
hammersley
to
save
those
papers
when
you
knew
that
they
were
dangerous
to
england
i
didn
t
know
what
they
were
i
did
what
he
asked
me
to
do
because
because
she
faltered
von
stromberg
waved
his
hand
oh
very
well
it
does
not
matter
who
did
you
think
was
pursuing
hammersley
agents
of
why
did
you
think
that
because
i
heard
part
of
what
happened
between
rizzio
and
hammersley
in
the
at
lady
heathcote
s
and
i
knew
that
rizzio
had
threatened
did
you
think
the
men
who
followed
you
in
the
other
machine
were
german
agents
doris
answered
quickly
oh
no
i
was
sure
that
they
were
men
of
scotland
are
you
sure
now
oh
yes
subsequent
events
have
proved
it
to
me
oh
what
events
the
things
that
rizzio
did
and
what
he
he
wrote
to
you
rizzio
was
swallowing
uneasily
his
face
pale
his
hands
trembling
excellenz
i
can
explain
at
another
von
stromberg
regarded
him
coolly
i
will
hear
you
at
another
time
for
the
present
frÃ¤ulein
mather
will
speak
what
did
rizzio
write
to
you
that
led
you
to
think
that
rizzio
was
in
communication
with
scotland
yard
this
letter
she
put
her
fingers
into
her
waist
and
handed
a
crumpled
paper
to
the
general
rizzio
had
risen
again
and
would
have
interposed
but
von
stromberg
waved
him
aside
you
will
all
keep
silence
until
questioned
he
said
abruptly
and
then
smoothing
the
letter
upon
his
knee
read
it
with
great
care
and
deliberateness
rizzio
made
an
effort
at
composure
but
only
succeeded
in
bringing
out
a
handkerchief
and
wiping
his
brows
hammersley
watched
von
stromberg
intently
he
was
not
aware
of
the
contents
of
this
letter
but
the
attitude
of
the
girl
was
distinctly
reassuring
von
stromberg
s
brow
puckered
disagreeably
and
his
long
nose
neared
the
paper
while
his
eyes
peered
at
the
sheet
as
though
his
fiery
gaze
would
burn
into
it
he
read
the
paper
through
twice
and
then
brought
his
hand
down
upon
the
table
with
a
crash
while
his
voice
thundered
at
rizzio
toward
whom
he
extended
the
note
it
is
signed
with
your
initials
did
you
write
this
rizzio
bent
and
examined
the
letter
excellenz
i
did
but
it
was
with
the
object
of
bringing
miss
mather
to
silence
perhaps
you
do
not
recall
its
terms
i
will
refresh
your
excellenz
if
i
had
not
written
that
letter
miss
mather
would
not
have
be
quiet
sit
down
please
listen
i
am
telling
you
this
he
read
to
warn
you
that
my
generosity
to
hammersley
is
not
actuated
by
any
love
of
a
man
who
has
spoiled
my
dearest
ambition
but
by
the
continued
esteem
with
which
i
still
regard
yourself
i
do
not
love
him
and
my
own
wish
my
duty
my
own
honor
my
loyalty
to
england
all
acclaim
that
he
should
be
delivered
at
once
to
those
in
authority
and
yet
i
have
refrained
for
you
doris
but
i
have
learned
that
h
is
in
communication
with
g
and
that
crenshaw
of
scotland
yard
is
on
the
alert
i
may
not
be
able
to
save
von
stromberg
paused
and
laid
the
letter
upon
the
table
i
could
read
more
he
said
but
that
is
enough
when
did
you
receive
this
letter
frÃ¤ulein
the
day
after
hammersley
was
shot
and
acting
upon
it
you
went
to
to
try
to
persuade
him
from
the
cause
of
yes
she
said
clearly
you
failed
i
h
the
general
paused
and
turned
to
rizzio
what
have
you
to
say
merely
excellenz
that
i
thought
miss
mather
knew
too
much
for
germany
s
good
and
i
chose
this
means
of
getting
her
to
where
she
could
witness
a
secret
meeting
between
two
officers
of
my
department
bah
herr
rizzio
your
story
leaks
like
a
sieve
it
is
full
of
he
touched
the
bell
at
his
elbow
and
von
winden
appeared
you
will
convey
herr
rizzio
to
the
room
on
the
third
floor
put
a
guard
over
rizzio
started
to
his
feet
his
face
ghastly
while
beads
of
moisture
stood
out
upon
his
forehead
you
will
not
give
me
a
chance
to
explain
he
protested
huskily
you
will
be
given
a
hearing
but
excellenz
take
him
away
as
the
door
closed
behind
the
two
men
general
von
stromberg
came
forward
and
took
hammersley
by
the
hand
i
am
glad
that
there
is
no
longer
any
suspicion
upon
you
i
have
always
liked
you
herr
hammersley
and
you
have
done
the
vaterland
excellent
service
i
am
sorry
that
this
investigation
was
necessary
but
in
times
like
these
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
take
i
understand
excellenz
but
it
hasn
t
discommoded
me
in
the
von
stromberg
laughed
i
can
readily
believe
it
you
are
always
as
cool
as
a
morning
in
may
as
for
frÃ¤ulein
mather
and
he
turned
ceremoniously
to
doris
and
bowed
deeply
it
has
all
been
a
mistake
if
the
efforts
of
a
councilor
of
the
empire
in
undoing
the
wrong
done
you
by
sending
you
with
every
comfort
and
dispatch
to
england
are
any
sign
of
regret
you
shall
be
safely
on
the
way
tomorrow
but
i
am
sure
that
in
your
heart
you
are
glad
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
clear
herr
hammersley
of
an
unjust
yes
she
murmured
turning
away
toward
the
window
but
you
still
wish
that
the
part
of
herr
hammersley
which
is
english
had
been
the
greater
part
of
him
instead
of
the
lesser
she
bowed
her
head
but
did
not
reply
perhaps
it
would
be
better
if
i
left
you
two
alone
together
there
is
doubtless
much
that
you
would
say
which
would
be
only
interesting
to
and
then
he
went
out
closing
the
door
behind
him
chapter
xvi
the
general
plays
to
win
when
general
von
stromberg
went
out
of
the
room
doris
turned
toward
cyril
her
happiness
in
her
eyes
where
he
could
read
it
if
he
wished
but
instead
of
coming
to
her
he
made
a
warning
gesture
and
then
walked
slowly
around
the
room
peering
out
of
the
windows
and
listening
at
the
doors
until
satisfied
that
they
were
unobserved
then
he
beckoned
her
to
a
spot
out
of
the
line
of
vision
of
the
door
into
the
adjoining
room
she
obeyed
it
wonderingly
while
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
passionately
thank
god
he
whispered
you
oh
cyril
she
gasped
if
anything
had
happened
to
you
we
must
be
careful
he
went
on
whispering
hastily
my
success
hangs
by
a
hair
tonight
the
thing
that
i
came
for
will
be
within
my
reach
i
must
have
there
will
be
danger
i
hope
not
but
you
must
not
trust
his
promises
to
send
you
away
you
must
get
away
from
here
tonight
before
eleven
i
will
help
you
before
then
i
must
see
you
alone
it
is
not
safe
to
talk
he
pressed
her
hand
hurriedly
and
moved
slowly
across
the
room
close
to
the
wall
and
door
which
he
examined
as
he
passed
but
cyril
a
warning
finger
stopped
her
there
is
no
use
in
your
trying
to
persuade
me
old
girl
he
said
his
voice
raised
to
a
tone
which
seemed
louder
than
necessary
i
am
only
doing
my
duty
as
i
see
it
but
whatever
happens
i
can
at
least
remember
that
you
told
the
what
did
he
mean
she
couldn
t
understand
she
followed
him
with
her
gaze
the
fingers
of
one
hand
were
tracing
the
flowers
of
the
wallpaper
upon
one
side
of
the
room
and
as
she
looked
he
glanced
out
of
the
window
and
then
got
quickly
upon
a
chair
and
peered
into
an
aperture
in
the
cornice
i
am
not
sorry
for
rizzio
he
said
again
dusting
off
the
chair
and
replacing
it
he
only
gets
what
he
deserved
what
did
he
do
to
you
how
did
he
find
you
a
glance
at
his
face
showed
her
that
he
expected
her
to
reply
i
was
lost
on
the
moor
she
faltered
i
followed
you
to
rudha
mor
and
saw
you
leave
in
the
yellow
dove
when
i
turned
to
go
back
a
cloth
was
thrown
over
my
head
they
chloroformed
me
he
muttered
an
imprecation
and
on
the
yacht
i
i
had
nothing
to
complain
of
he
did
everything
he
could
for
my
she
watched
him
again
moving
around
the
room
at
the
chimney
he
paused
and
reaching
swiftly
upward
lifted
the
clock
and
then
put
it
into
its
place
again
the
expression
in
his
face
still
strained
and
anxious
i
am
not
sorry
for
him
he
said
again
suddenly
he
came
to
her
saying
in
such
a
low
whisper
that
she
could
hardly
hear
him
i
m
not
satisfied
there
s
something
dangerous
in
von
stromberg
s
sudden
kindness
doris
we
are
and
then
in
louder
tones
if
anything
had
happened
to
you
she
glanced
around
her
timidly
her
initiative
suddenly
at
a
loss
happened
to
me
she
repeated
bewildered
i
would
have
made
another
death
for
him
a
man
s
death
at
it
is
terrible
she
managed
to
say
and
i
will
have
been
the
cause
of
he
came
closer
and
took
her
by
the
hand
speaking
distinctly
and
do
you
regret
that
it
is
rizzio
instead
of
me
no
no
she
stammered
her
accents
of
horror
were
genuine
but
it
seemed
more
horrible
that
she
should
be
making
a
farce
of
her
genuine
emotions
yet
cyril
s
eyes
impelled
her
it
is
terrible
i
can
t
believe
general
von
stromberg
is
not
a
man
to
make
idle
threats
i
am
glad
that
i
am
not
in
rizzio
s
she
saw
him
pause
his
mouth
open
gazing
upward
at
the
lithograph
of
emperor
william
to
doris
the
picture
merely
typified
power
ambition
intolerance
of
any
ideals
but
those
of
military
glory
but
it
was
not
at
the
portrait
that
cyril
was
looking
he
was
examining
the
frame
which
was
swung
a
little
to
one
side
revealing
a
patch
of
unfaded
wallpaper
he
looked
down
into
the
fireplace
thoughtfully
and
while
the
girl
wondered
what
he
was
going
to
do
next
he
whirled
suddenly
and
moved
quickly
toward
the
door
into
the
hall
which
he
opened
swiftly
straight
into
the
face
of
captain
wentz
who
managed
to
step
back
only
in
time
to
avoid
it
but
the
officer
was
equal
to
the
occasion
i
was
seeking
general
von
stromberg
he
said
coolly
he
isn
t
here
doris
heard
cyril
say
quietly
and
then
i
wanted
a
glass
of
water
frÃ¤ulein
mather
is
feeling
ah
i
will
have
it
brought
at
as
he
disappeared
in
the
passage
to
the
kitchen
cyril
closed
the
door
and
came
in
three
strides
to
the
fireplace
reached
up
and
raised
the
picture
from
the
wall
peering
under
it
and
touched
the
surface
of
the
wallpaper
with
the
tips
of
his
fingers
then
with
great
care
he
put
the
picture
back
in
its
place
and
bent
over
doris
close
to
her
ear
whispering
they
suspect
everything
we
have
said
has
been
overheard
a
microphone
i
knew
it
was
here
the
pallor
of
her
face
when
the
man
from
the
kitchen
brought
the
water
was
almost
convincing
proof
of
the
truth
of
hammersley
s
statement
she
did
look
ill
for
terror
of
the
situation
that
confronted
them
had
driven
the
blood
back
to
her
heart
a
moment
ago
the
room
had
seemed
so
friendly
and
now
every
object
in
it
was
a
menace
and
above
the
mantel
the
emperor
of
germany
with
his
upturned
mustaches
glared
down
at
her
austerely
eloquent
of
the
relentless
forces
that
held
them
in
their
thrall
behind
her
she
heard
cyril
whispering
with
the
man
who
had
brought
the
water
and
realized
that
it
was
the
tall
soldier
with
the
lame
leg
who
had
brought
her
toast
and
eggs
upstairs
lindberg
cyril
said
aloud
she
is
tired
from
the
perhaps
herr
hammersley
a
little
fresh
air
will
help
a
stroll
in
the
kitchen
doris
got
up
in
sudden
relief
as
she
understood
yes
she
said
perhaps
i
will
feel
better
in
the
cyril
led
the
way
to
the
door
and
together
they
went
out
they
heard
sounds
of
heavy
footsteps
in
the
hallway
above
but
did
not
pause
making
their
way
along
the
path
which
led
around
the
house
cyril
did
not
turn
toward
her
but
she
heard
him
speaking
they
will
call
us
back
do
not
be
frightened
if
von
stromberg
questions
again
answer
to
the
best
of
your
ability
i
will
find
a
means
of
reaching
your
room
tonight
in
the
meanwhile
keep
up
your
she
did
not
reply
for
she
heard
steps
behind
her
and
turning
found
captain
wentz
who
bowed
taking
off
his
cap
general
von
stromberg
requests
me
to
ask
he
said
in
very
good
english
if
miss
mather
will
not
give
him
the
pleasure
of
joining
him
in
a
cup
of
he
is
very
kind
she
said
slowly
with
a
glance
at
cyril
of
course
i
shall
be
very
the
officer
replaced
his
cap
and
turning
to
hammersley
spoke
in
german
his
excellenz
also
requests
that
herr
hammersley
will
remain
within
hammersley
bowed
tell
his
excellenz
with
my
compliments
that
with
his
permission
i
will
smoke
my
pipe
here
in
the
kitchen
doris
followed
the
officer
into
the
room
they
had
just
left
and
von
stromberg
joined
her
almost
immediately
gnÃ¤diges
he
said
with
his
blandest
manner
you
will
forgive
me
for
calling
you
back
from
your
contemplation
of
the
beauties
of
this
lovely
afternoon
but
there
are
certain
questions
merely
trifling
ones
which
have
to
do
with
the
fate
of
herr
rizzio
which
i
neglected
to
ask
you
you
will
not
begrudge
an
old
man
the
privilege
of
a
few
words
over
a
cup
of
chocolate
she
smiled
at
him
bravely
as
a
woman
can
do
even
in
a
last
extremity
and
told
him
that
she
was
flattered
by
this
mark
of
his
condescension
a
wave
of
the
hand
and
wentz
disappeared
while
lindberg
the
lame
man
entered
with
the
chocolate
the
general
had
the
tray
put
upon
the
table
before
her
and
asked
her
to
serve
it
standing
erect
and
watching
her
with
open
admiration
doris
was
frightened
for
she
had
already
seen
the
power
that
this
old
man
possessed
but
with
an
effort
she
found
her
composure
and
made
up
her
mind
that
if
she
was
alarmed
von
stromberg
at
least
should
not
be
aware
of
it
the
safest
defense
against
such
a
man
was
audacity
you
were
feeling
ill
he
said
suavely
sympathetic
the
long
morning
in
the
train
and
the
strain
of
your
ordeal
it
is
but
natural
a
little
cup
of
chocolate
and
a
biscuit
should
revive
you
wonderfully
wahr
his
english
though
excellent
had
a
slight
german
accent
and
his
tone
the
quality
of
a
lullaby
it
is
very
good
said
doris
i
have
often
heard
it
said
that
nowhere
in
the
world
is
chocolate
so
excellent
as
in
i
trust
that
you
may
find
it
so
there
are
many
things
beside
chocolate
that
are
excellent
in
germany
frÃ¤ulein
i
am
sure
that
must
be
true
she
said
politely
touching
the
cup
to
her
lips
then
why
do
you
dislike
us
so
much
he
asked
with
a
smile
it
is
not
your
people
that
i
dislike
so
much
general
von
stromberg
many
of
the
most
charming
people
i
have
ever
known
have
been
germans
it
is
not
what
you
are
but
what
you
want
to
be
that
i
dislike
not
your
habits
or
your
tastes
but
your
intolerance
of
any
civilization
which
happens
to
differ
from
she
paused
a
little
frightened
at
her
temerity
but
von
stromberg
still
smiled
go
on
he
chuckled
you
speak
very
i
am
an
american
general
von
stromberg
from
the
united
states
where
people
are
accustomed
to
speak
what
they
feel
without
fear
of
if
the
president
of
the
united
states
did
something
that
i
didn
t
like
i
would
write
him
a
and
would
he
answer
it
he
purred
if
he
had
time
yes
if
anyone
wrote
such
a
letter
to
your
emperor
he
would
be
boiled
in
von
stromberg
roared
with
delight
boiled
in
oil
he
repeated
yes
or
perhaps
some
more
exquisite
cruelty
that
your
ingenious
people
have
devised
she
said
coolly
to
prosaic
minds
like
mine
excellenz
you
germans
are
the
wonders
of
the
age
you
are
both
godlike
and
saturnian
a
nation
of
military
fanatics
a
nation
of
silly
sentimentalists
a
nation
trained
to
scientific
brutality
which
shares
the
sorrows
of
the
dying
rose
which
is
it
that
you
want
us
to
think
you
the
god
or
the
satyr
we
know
that
we
are
the
god
he
said
showing
his
teeth
but
we
want
you
to
think
us
the
you
have
succeeded
excellenz
she
replied
calmly
it
is
very
pleasant
to
be
sitting
here
drinking
chocolate
with
a
a
councilor
of
the
empire
but
you
ll
pardon
me
if
i
say
that
the
peculiarly
social
pleasure
of
the
occasion
is
somewhat
marred
by
the
fact
that
if
the
whim
happened
to
strike
you
you
could
have
me
strung
up
by
the
you
think
that
i
am
cruel
no
frÃ¤ulein
you
are
mistaken
in
his
blandest
tones
i
have
a
daughter
in
east
prussia
of
just
your
age
for
that
reason
i
would
like
to
have
you
think
of
me
a
little
as
the
sentimentalist
rather
than
as
the
the
brute
as
you
have
been
pleased
to
suggest
i
am
not
cruel
and
i
shall
prove
it
to
in
america
excellenz
we
do
not
make
war
upon
nor
do
i
make
war
upon
you
he
put
in
quickly
i
did
not
bring
you
to
germany
frÃ¤ulein
herr
rizzio
acted
upon
his
own
responsibility
even
yet
if
he
is
an
english
agent
i
can
not
understand
his
purpose
in
bringing
such
an
incriminating
he
smiled
as
he
spoke
but
she
felt
the
question
and
its
threat
for
a
moment
the
directness
of
his
attack
bewildered
her
and
so
she
sipped
her
chocolate
to
gain
a
moment
of
time
general
von
stromberg
she
said
at
last
as
the
idea
came
to
her
i
am
told
that
you
have
one
of
the
keenest
intellects
in
the
empire
of
germany
i
feel
much
like
a
child
before
you
who
should
see
matters
much
more
clearly
than
i
there
were
two
reasons
why
he
brought
me
one
of
which
bears
upon
our
personal
relations
the
other
upon
his
relation
to
england
i
knew
that
he
possessed
your
confidence
otherwise
he
would
not
have
been
in
possession
of
a
document
which
empowered
hammersley
to
give
up
the
secret
message
of
captain
byfield
i
knew
too
much
if
i
had
told
my
friends
in
england
what
i
knew
his
utility
to
england
would
have
been
why
it
seems
to
me
that
having
my
confidence
would
have
made
his
utility
to
england
the
he
would
have
been
suspected
of
double
dealing
would
he
not
as
a
friend
of
england
you
would
have
let
him
be
suspected
he
asked
quietly
given
evidence
against
a
man
whom
you
knew
to
be
acting
in
england
s
interests
there
were
other
other
interests
she
faltered
more
important
to
me
than
england
s
hammersley
s
you
have
a
daughter
excellenz
perhaps
you
would
try
to
think
of
me
as
you
would
think
of
her
in
a
similar
situation
when
i
read
those
papers
at
ashwater
park
i
knew
that
the
man
to
whom
i
was
promised
and
of
whom
i
had
always
thought
as
an
englishman
was
acting
as
a
secret
agent
a
spy
of
germany
he
was
pursued
by
agents
of
the
english
war
office
i
knew
that
if
his
connection
with
germany
were
discovered
he
would
be
shot
i
was
frightened
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
john
rizzio
followed
me
to
scotland
and
tried
to
get
the
papers
i
refused
to
give
them
to
him
and
then
when
when
hammersley
came
i
burned
them
there
was
nothing
left
for
me
to
do
for
england
for
him
if
there
were
no
papers
there
could
be
no
evidence
against
she
paused
to
get
her
breath
aware
that
her
companion
was
listening
intently
and
fearfully
afraid
that
she
was
saying
too
much
and
then
he
asked
and
then
she
went
on
more
slowly
i
found
the
other
papers
when
i
wouldn
t
give
them
to
him
hammersley
took
them
away
from
me
we
quarreled
excellenz
and
i
gave
him
and
after
that
after
that
came
rizzio
s
note
asking
me
to
go
to
and
see
the
meeting
between
cyr
between
hammersley
and
your
messenger
in
the
last
hope
that
i
could
make
hammersley
give
up
his
plans
to
deliver
the
message
to
you
as
you
know
i
failed
it
was
there
after
that
that
rizzio
who
had
overheard
our
conversation
tried
to
kill
hammersley
knowing
that
he
had
resolved
to
deliver
the
she
got
up
and
paced
the
floor
oh
it
is
so
clear
what
rizzio
was
that
i
wonder
that
it
should
be
necessary
for
me
to
tell
it
to
yes
i
see
and
the
other
the
personal
reasons
you
she
hesitated
it
is
difficult
to
speak
of
them
but
i
will
tell
you
rizzio
has
forfeited
all
right
to
my
loyalty
he
offered
to
marry
me
i
refused
him
he
told
me
he
would
never
give
me
up
in
scotland
he
threatened
cyril
hammersley
s
life
i
know
now
what
he
yes
but
in
his
letter
to
you
he
does
not
threaten
he
urges
that
he
is
doing
what
he
can
to
save
hammersley
i
did
not
believe
him
i
was
right
events
have
proved
it
he
would
have
been
glad
to
see
hammersley
out
of
the
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
sank
into
her
chair
again
oh
she
whispered
it
is
horrible
horrible
and
it
is
i
who
must
be
the
instrument
of
von
stromberg
waited
for
a
moment
tapping
one
finger
of
his
left
hand
very
slowly
upon
the
back
of
his
right
try
to
compose
yourself
he
urged
calmly
and
as
she
looked
up
at
him
you
say
he
wanted
to
be
rid
of
herr
hammersley
can
you
tell
me
then
why
his
men
did
not
shoot
him
when
they
had
him
prisoner
at
ashwater
park
gates
i
do
not
know
perhaps
they
would
have
done
so
if
he
hadn
t
von
stromberg
paused
again
and
then
gently
you
love
herr
hammersley
a
great
deal
frÃ¤ulein
she
bent
her
gaze
upon
him
appealingly
would
i
now
be
here
excellenz
she
asked
von
stromberg
bent
his
head
and
then
got
up
and
slowly
paced
the
length
of
the
room
when
he
returned
there
was
another
note
in
his
voice
it
was
still
quiet
but
the
legato
note
had
gone
and
it
was
you
do
well
to
tell
your
story
through
the
medium
of
sentiment
which
you
well
understand
rather
than
through
the
medium
of
logic
which
you
do
not
understand
which
no
woman
at
his
change
of
tone
she
glanced
up
he
was
leering
at
her
unpleasantly
i
do
not
know
what
you
mean
she
murmured
you
are
very
clever
frÃ¤ulein
but
your
story
has
a
great
many
holes
in
it
little
holes
which
might
grow
into
big
ones
if
one
were
disposed
to
enlarge
them
there
are
several
things
which
are
not
at
all
clear
to
me
of
course
it
must
be
as
apparent
to
you
as
it
is
to
me
that
if
herr
rizzio
was
an
english
agent
by
remaining
in
england
he
had
nothing
to
fear
from
you
or
anyone
else
his
object
too
in
bringing
you
to
germany
is
clear
as
you
say
you
knew
too
much
not
about
his
connection
with
the
english
war
office
which
of
course
would
not
matter
in
the
least
but
about
herr
rizzio
s
connection
with
which
would
have
mattered
a
great
he
tapped
his
long
forefinger
upon
his
breast
significantly
and
leaned
forward
ominously
across
the
table
he
dominated
hypnotized
her
she
closed
her
eyes
trembling
violently
do
you
mean
that
you
do
not
believe
his
letter
excellenz
surely
you
believe
that
to
be
genuine
bait
frÃ¤ulein
that
is
all
excellent
bait
you
swallowed
it
herr
hammersley
very
cleverly
prepared
himself
against
surprise
only
the
fortunate
accident
of
your
losing
yourself
upon
the
moor
saved
herr
rizzio
from
oh
you
are
all
wrong
you
are
willfully
making
me
suffer
i
have
told
the
von
stromberg
straightened
and
drew
from
his
pocket
a
military
telegraph
form
which
he
smoothed
out
gently
with
his
long
bony
fingers
unfortunately
for
herr
hammersley
i
have
just
received
a
message
from
another
agent
in
london
in
whom
i
have
implicit
faith
you
read
german
a
little
would
you
care
to
see
it
he
laid
it
upon
the
table
before
her
eyes
and
she
looked
her
eyes
distended
with
terror
of
she
knew
now
what
hammersley
caused
arrest
of
byfield
has
informed
on
rizzio
and
myself
am
in
hiding
in
kent
will
reach
germany
by
usual
methods
maxwell
doris
sat
immovable
petrified
with
horror
von
stromberg
s
voice
crackled
harshly
at
her
ear
well
and
what
have
you
to
say
it
is
a
lie
she
managed
to
stammer
he
lies
lies
i
tell
you
if
i
could
believe
you
why
should
he
lie
unlike
the
case
of
rizzio
herr
hammersley
has
not
robbed
herr
maxwell
of
a
there
is
a
mistake
i
fear
but
why
should
hammersley
have
come
he
would
have
been
safe
in
england
he
himself
says
to
the
contrary
she
was
breaking
fast
and
he
sought
further
to
involve
her
he
did
not
have
to
come
why
should
he
have
come
she
asked
wildly
rising
to
her
feet
and
laying
her
hands
upon
his
arm
answer
me
that
for
reply
he
turned
away
from
her
abruptly
and
walked
the
length
of
the
room
to
an
end
window
where
he
stood
for
a
moment
looking
out
come
frÃ¤ulein
and
i
will
show
you
she
approached
him
blindly
and
followed
his
gaze
around
the
corner
of
the
building
upon
a
tree
stump
in
the
kitchen
garden
looking
out
across
the
fields
toward
the
wooded
hills
sat
hammersley
calmly
smoking
half
of
his
blood
is
english
half
prussian
frÃ¤ulein
but
it
is
the
english
in
him
that
dominates
is
there
anything
that
is
prussian
about
him
tell
me
from
the
crown
of
his
head
to
the
sole
of
his
foot
his
pipe
his
bent
shoulders
his
careless
air
he
is
english
all
english
he
knows
that
at
this
moment
i
am
weighing
his
fate
in
the
balance
and
yet
he
smokes
his
short
wooden
pipe
if
he
has
prussian
blood
it
is
a
pity
for
germany
needs
all
the
prussian
blood
that
flows
red
in
the
veins
of
he
paused
and
then
abruptly
but
the
prussian
blood
must
be
sacrificed
with
the
english
she
fell
back
from
him
deathly
white
groping
for
a
chair
to
support
her
you
mean
she
whispered
that
i
can
take
no
chances
he
will
be
shot
o
god
he
is
loyal
to
germany
i
swear
her
utterance
was
choked
her
breath
came
with
difficulty
the
room
darkened
suddenly
and
she
seemed
about
to
swoon
she
dropped
to
her
knees
beside
the
armchair
clinging
to
it
trying
to
speak
but
no
words
would
come
she
was
aware
of
his
face
bending
over
her
as
though
in
the
act
of
striking
its
prey
and
she
heard
his
voice
at
her
ear
there
is
one
chance
to
save
she
reached
his
hand
and
clung
to
it
a
chance
what
tell
me
the
truth
he
said
sternly
i
i
have
told
you
the
truth
he
is
he
loosened
her
fingers
and
stood
away
he
muttered
leaning
forward
the
truth
girl
i
i
she
fell
against
the
chair
and
clung
to
it
for
support
the
truth
and
he
becomes
an
honorable
prisoner
of
war
silence
and
he
is
shot
tomorrow
illustration
the
truth
and
he
becomes
an
honorable
prisoner
of
war
silence
and
he
is
shot
tomorrow
he
is
the
words
choked
her
he
is
bah
he
growled
moving
toward
the
table
you
have
already
convicted
him
she
struggled
to
her
feet
and
followed
him
he
was
about
to
touch
the
bell
when
she
caught
his
arm
wait
she
whispered
what
guarantee
have
i
that
he
will
not
be
injured
he
shrugged
and
laughed
i
need
give
no
guarantee
now
frÃ¤ulein
this
is
not
a
court
of
law
i
am
the
judge
of
what
constitutes
proof
you
have
he
shook
her
off
and
sounded
the
bell
which
was
immediately
answered
by
udo
von
winden
you
will
conduct
frÃ¤ulein
mather
to
her
room
upstairs
lock
the
door
and
bring
me
the
key
then
tell
herr
hammersley
that
i
am
waiting
to
see
chapter
xvii
lindberg
when
hammersley
entered
the
house
with
von
winden
he
was
immediately
aware
that
a
crisis
had
come
in
his
affairs
for
in
the
hall
leading
to
the
stood
captain
wentz
and
two
soldiers
and
when
he
was
shown
into
von
stromberg
s
presence
the
councilor
stood
with
his
back
to
the
hearth
his
long
legs
wide
apart
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
the
expression
of
his
long
bony
face
was
not
pleasant
to
see
he
smiled
and
frowned
at
the
same
time
a
smile
which
possessed
so
few
of
the
ingredients
of
humor
that
the
tangled
brows
even
seemed
less
ominous
doris
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
hammersley
made
no
sign
of
his
prescience
of
trouble
he
put
his
pipe
in
the
pocket
of
his
leather
jacket
strolled
forward
into
the
room
and
stood
at
attention
search
him
snapped
von
stromberg
and
when
von
winden
had
finished
leave
us
he
said
to
the
officer
and
keep
within
call
i
shall
need
you
he
waited
until
the
door
was
closed
and
then
turned
to
hammersley
somberly
your
jig
is
danced
herr
hammersley
frÃ¤ulein
mather
has
confessed
what
excellenz
questioned
hammersley
calmly
she
has
told
the
of
course
that
was
to
be
expected
of
bah
roared
the
general
there
s
no
need
of
more
of
that
she
told
me
that
you
were
an
english
hammersley
started
forward
the
only
expression
on
his
face
one
of
complete
incredulity
frÃ¤ulein
mather
told
you
that
impossible
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
don
t
believe
me
hammersley
managed
a
smile
it
would
hardly
be
good
ethics
for
me
to
say
that
i
simply
repeat
that
it
is
why
von
stromberg
sneered
because
it
is
morally
impossible
for
her
to
tell
an
so
but
it
is
impossible
for
her
to
keep
from
doing
he
leaned
forward
grinning
craftily
in
the
small
games
of
life
in
the
things
which
amount
to
nothing
women
lie
with
a
careless
skill
that
is
amazing
but
in
a
game
of
life
and
death
their
little
tricks
are
negligible
pouf
herr
hammersley
did
you
expect
to
match
mere
falsehood
and
such
a
tissue
of
flimsy
evidence
against
a
man
of
my
experience
it
was
a
desperate
game
from
the
beginning
one
which
could
have
had
only
one
end
you
have
been
clever
very
very
clever
in
time
perhaps
under
proper
guidance
and
with
the
necessary
political
opinions
you
could
have
succeeded
in
becoming
a
very
useful
helper
of
the
universe
through
the
medium
of
the
secret
service
department
of
the
german
empire
but
such
cleverness
is
superficial
and
quickly
burns
out
in
the
hotter
fire
of
genius
i
would
like
you
to
know
one
moment
excellenz
put
in
hammersley
coolly
am
i
to
understand
from
your
attitude
that
you
believe
i
am
false
to
the
vaterland
von
stromberg
laughed
you
still
insist
on
acting
out
the
part
hammersley
did
not
answer
the
question
instead
he
asked
will
you
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
upon
what
new
evidence
you
base
your
present
position
the
councilor
strode
to
the
table
and
thrust
the
telegraphic
message
he
had
shown
to
the
girl
under
hammersley
s
nose
this
he
growled
i
will
read
it
to
you
hammersley
caused
arrest
of
byfield
has
informed
on
rizzio
and
myself
it
s
signed
what
do
you
think
of
my
evidence
he
grinned
convincing
hammersley
looked
up
into
von
stromberg
s
face
with
a
smile
not
even
in
code
excellenz
it
is
a
pity
you
did
not
write
it
in
english
but
under
the
circumstances
you
can
t
expect
me
to
take
any
interest
in
such
a
not
you
herr
hammersley
he
chuckled
it
is
not
necessary
that
you
should
believe
in
it
in
fact
there
are
reasons
why
you
shouldn
t
believe
in
it
the
most
important
reason
being
that
herr
maxwell
is
dead
obviously
you
condemned
him
and
he
was
put
in
prison
if
he
is
not
dead
it
is
through
no
fault
of
hammersley
smiled
you
can
not
get
me
to
acquiesce
in
such
strange
i
do
not
ask
you
to
acquiesce
i
could
not
expect
to
catch
herr
hammersley
by
a
trick
but
miss
mather
was
less
hammersley
s
jaws
set
i
understand
but
do
you
mean
to
say
that
i
can
be
incriminated
by
a
confession
made
under
the
stress
of
a
terror
artificially
produced
that
is
a
clever
turn
of
phrase
herr
hammersley
worthy
of
the
high
regard
with
which
i
hold
your
abilities
in
reply
i
can
only
say
that
in
time
of
war
my
deductions
in
all
matters
connected
with
my
department
are
final
you
are
an
english
spy
herr
hammersley
and
you
are
quite
aware
of
the
hammersley
raised
his
head
and
folded
his
arms
quite
he
replied
if
you
choose
to
take
that
action
i
can
only
say
that
the
time
will
come
when
you
will
regret
i
must
take
that
chance
for
there
will
be
no
hammersley
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
turned
aside
his
face
was
white
and
the
muscles
at
his
jaws
worked
for
a
moment
but
otherwise
he
gave
no
sign
of
emotion
general
von
stromberg
had
gone
back
to
his
favorite
pose
by
the
mantel
and
hammersley
again
heard
his
voice
it
seems
a
pity
herr
hammersley
that
after
all
it
should
be
you
instead
of
herr
rizzio
who
is
the
culprit
you
are
a
type
of
young
man
very
much
to
my
liking
and
the
position
of
the
young
lady
is
unpleasant
in
the
extreme
she
has
served
her
purpose
here
and
i
shall
of
course
take
immediate
steps
to
have
her
returned
to
her
own
thanks
said
hammersley
dryly
but
the
thing
that
has
interested
me
in
your
case
from
the
first
he
continued
with
a
return
of
his
mastodonic
playfulness
and
indeed
still
continues
to
interest
me
is
why
you
should
choose
to
return
to
germany
when
you
knew
that
you
were
under
suspicion
surely
you
did
not
come
here
to
pick
cowslips
in
march
come
now
i
could
have
you
shot
this
afternoon
if
i
chose
tell
me
the
truth
and
i
will
promise
to
postpone
the
affair
until
hammersley
studied
the
pattern
in
the
rug
thoughtfully
for
a
moment
and
at
last
he
straightened
and
shrugged
again
i
don
t
suppose
there
is
any
use
playing
the
game
further
since
i
am
to
go
it
doesn
t
matter
if
i
tell
you
i
have
planned
for
some
time
to
be
able
to
get
plans
of
the
recent
additions
to
the
fortifications
of
strassburg
and
what
may
i
ask
were
to
be
your
means
of
procuring
them
that
of
course
since
my
utility
has
ceased
can
not
possibly
be
of
interest
to
von
stromberg
studied
him
narrowly
for
a
long
moment
and
then
wagged
his
head
sagely
it
was
an
unnecessary
suspicion
that
he
had
cherished
this
had
been
a
case
with
interesting
aspects
but
after
all
it
was
not
much
out
of
the
usual
way
an
english
spy
betrayed
by
the
simplest
of
tricks
upon
the
credulity
and
affection
of
a
woman
he
thought
that
hammersley
had
been
after
bigger
game
plans
fortifications
the
same
objects
the
same
methods
von
stromberg
had
tried
to
puzzle
out
in
the
mazes
of
his
wonderful
brain
the
possible
chance
that
this
man
could
have
had
of
learning
of
the
whereabouts
of
herr
gottschalk
s
memoranda
and
of
the
momentous
decision
which
had
been
reached
in
the
wilhelmstrasse
with
regard
to
them
he
studied
hammersley
closely
with
something
approaching
regret
that
the
contest
between
them
could
not
have
been
waged
at
greater
length
and
for
higher
stakes
he
felt
a
genuine
human
sorrow
at
this
moment
over
the
impending
fate
of
this
handsome
young
man
who
was
only
doing
his
duty
for
the
fatuous
english
it
was
too
bad
but
there
was
much
else
to
do
tomorrow
his
mission
in
this
part
of
the
empire
would
be
ended
and
the
wilhelmstrasse
was
calling
he
touched
the
bell
upon
the
table
and
captain
wentz
entered
herr
hammersley
is
to
be
taken
to
the
room
on
the
third
floor
tonight
you
will
see
that
he
is
securely
bound
and
a
guard
set
over
him
within
the
room
you
will
place
another
guard
outside
below
his
window
if
he
tries
to
escape
shoot
wentz
spoke
to
the
man
in
the
hall
and
hammersley
between
them
was
led
to
the
foot
of
the
steps
and
followed
his
captors
to
the
upper
story
he
knew
in
view
of
the
instructions
that
he
had
overheard
that
any
effort
to
escape
would
be
fruitless
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
submitting
calmly
while
his
feet
and
hands
were
bound
under
the
direction
of
captain
wentz
after
which
the
officers
went
out
leaving
a
man
to
guard
him
and
locked
the
door
hammersley
rolled
over
on
the
bed
and
lay
for
a
long
while
staring
at
the
wall
the
day
was
fading
into
dusk
five
o
clock
it
might
be
hammersley
guessed
six
hours
or
less
remained
to
him
in
which
to
act
six
hours
in
which
he
must
lie
helpless
while
the
one
chance
of
intercepting
the
messenger
from
berlin
came
and
passed
he
lay
perfectly
still
as
he
had
fallen
but
his
spirit
writhed
in
agony
doris
was
in
a
room
near
him
likewise
a
prisoner
aware
of
the
fate
in
store
for
him
and
able
to
do
nothing
but
wait
as
he
would
wait
until
the
shots
were
fired
below
there
in
the
garden
which
would
be
the
end
of
all
things
for
him
he
found
that
he
was
thinking
little
of
himself
it
was
doris
and
what
she
must
be
suffering
that
occupied
the
moments
of
his
thoughts
which
were
not
given
to
the
remote
chances
of
escape
his
bonds
were
tightly
drawn
a
rope
tied
with
german
thoroughness
he
moved
his
hands
behind
him
and
tried
to
gain
a
little
room
for
his
present
ease
if
he
was
to
be
shot
tomorrow
morning
it
would
have
seemed
indeed
a
small
charity
to
have
permitted
him
to
pass
his
last
night
in
some
degree
of
comfort
could
it
be
that
after
all
von
stromberg
suspected
the
real
object
of
his
return
that
hardly
seemed
possible
for
his
informant
in
berlin
a
woman
close
to
those
in
high
authority
had
made
every
move
with
the
utmost
discretion
and
his
own
relations
to
lindberg
could
not
possibly
be
suspected
lindberg
hammersley
turned
and
looked
at
his
guard
who
was
standing
motionless
by
the
window
gazing
out
at
the
fading
landscape
lindberg
was
his
one
his
last
desperate
hope
udo
von
winden
his
cousin
it
was
too
much
to
hope
that
udo
would
be
of
service
to
him
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
udo
s
face
in
the
hallway
downstairs
when
von
stromberg
s
orders
were
given
he
had
gone
pale
and
stared
at
him
in
pity
and
horror
as
hammersley
had
gone
up
the
stairs
but
hammersley
knew
that
the
ties
of
kinship
the
memories
of
their
boyhood
together
were
nothing
beside
the
iron
will
and
indomitable
authority
of
the
great
man
who
had
condemned
him
udo
would
suffer
when
hammersley
died
for
there
had
been
a
time
when
the
two
had
been
much
to
each
other
but
he
would
do
his
duty
however
painful
as
a
small
unit
of
the
relentless
machine
which
hammersley
had
had
the
temerity
to
oppose
what
else
could
be
expected
a
word
a
sign
the
slightest
aid
to
such
a
prisoner
and
he
would
be
as
guilty
as
his
cousin
hammersley
knew
that
he
did
udo
no
injustice
in
supposing
that
any
help
from
such
a
source
was
out
of
the
question
if
udo
had
been
caught
in
england
as
hammersley
was
caught
in
germany
hammersley
knew
that
he
could
do
nothing
to
save
him
but
lindberg
here
the
case
was
different
it
was
lindberg
whose
life
hammersley
had
saved
three
years
ago
in
this
very
forest
when
the
forester
had
stumbled
and
fallen
in
the
path
of
an
angry
boar
who
would
have
gored
him
to
death
if
hammersley
had
not
shot
the
beast
lindberg
the
forester
it
was
who
in
his
hours
off
duty
had
been
hammersley
s
chosen
companion
in
many
a
hunt
up
through
the
rocky
gorges
of
these
very
mountains
every
stick
and
stone
of
which
he
knew
as
he
knew
his
own
rugged
face
in
the
mirror
it
was
lindberg
who
had
been
so
useful
in
keeping
him
informed
of
the
exact
state
of
affairs
at
blaufelden
it
was
lindberg
who
had
learned
of
the
microphone
that
von
stromberg
had
installed
and
it
was
lindberg
who
had
listened
at
the
receiver
upstairs
in
von
stromberg
s
room
to
the
conversation
when
the
councilor
had
told
captain
wentz
the
nature
of
the
documents
from
berlin
and
the
hour
of
their
arrival
already
lindberg
had
repaid
a
hundredfold
the
debt
of
hammersley
s
service
and
it
was
quite
possible
now
that
hammersley
s
actual
mission
had
been
discovered
that
he
would
take
to
cover
his
mind
clear
in
the
thought
that
he
had
done
all
that
could
be
expected
of
him
but
there
was
a
warm
affection
between
the
two
born
of
many
a
long
day
in
the
open
and
many
a
night
by
the
campfire
where
the
old
man
had
taught
him
the
foresters
secrets
of
the
trees
the
birds
in
their
branches
and
of
the
many
things
that
scurried
beneath
them
they
had
often
talked
too
of
many
other
things
and
hammersley
had
learned
that
lindberg
s
politics
were
those
that
one
learns
under
the
open
sky
the
eternal
peace
of
nature
before
which
war
and
men
its
armed
instruments
were
a
blasphemy
perhaps
lindberg
would
find
a
way
but
what
way
how
udo
von
winden
too
was
aware
of
the
woodcraft
fellowship
for
often
he
had
made
their
duet
a
trio
hammersley
knew
that
udo
von
winden
as
yet
suspected
nothing
of
the
services
lindberg
had
rendered
him
and
he
wondered
whether
in
this
pass
the
ties
of
kinship
would
be
strong
enough
to
keep
him
silent
as
to
the
possible
capabilities
of
the
old
forester
for
mischief
in
hammersley
s
behalf
hammersley
hoped
he
clung
to
the
thought
of
lindberg
s
fidelity
and
affection
as
a
dying
man
clings
to
the
hope
of
heaven
he
tried
to
analyze
the
old
man
s
capacities
for
sympathy
and
courage
to
help
a
man
in
his
position
seemed
to
require
larger
stores
of
both
of
these
qualities
than
human
clay
was
molded
for
lindberg
did
not
fear
death
he
knew
but
the
death
he
courted
was
the
kind
of
death
hammersley
had
saved
him
from
a
good
death
in
a
fair
game
with
a
noble
enemy
not
the
kind
of
death
that
awaited
hammersley
a
cold
death
against
a
kitchen
wall
and
he
must
know
as
hammersley
knew
that
this
was
what
would
follow
the
dusk
faded
into
dark
and
the
soldier
lit
a
candle
hammersley
turned
his
head
and
examined
him
attentively
his
face
was
unfamiliar
at
blaufelden
one
of
the
men
probably
sent
down
at
von
stromberg
s
orders
from
the
upper
district
to
be
useful
in
just
this
emergency
von
stromberg
would
make
no
mistakes
of
course
he
never
did
make
mistakes
he
had
enough
men
about
him
to
cope
with
the
situation
safely
he
would
leave
no
opportunity
for
his
plans
to
miscarry
any
opportunity
should
there
be
one
must
be
created
hammersley
managed
to
wriggle
into
a
sitting
posture
on
the
bed
and
spoke
to
his
captor
in
german
you
wouldn
t
mind
my
having
a
smoke
would
you
he
asked
the
man
looked
at
him
debating
the
matter
just
get
into
the
side
pocket
of
my
jacket
and
fish
out
my
pipe
and
tobacco
i
need
a
smoke
badly
and
so
would
you
if
you
were
going
to
be
shot
in
the
i
see
no
harm
in
that
you
can
not
smoke
yourself
he
came
over
brought
out
hammersley
s
short
pipe
filled
it
from
the
pouch
and
stuck
it
between
his
lips
then
he
got
out
a
match
and
lighted
it
while
hammersley
puffed
ah
said
hammersley
contentedly
you
are
a
good
fellow
tomorrow
morning
i
will
give
you
my
the
man
paced
stolidly
up
and
down
beside
the
bed
i
am
sorry
for
you
but
it
is
life
it
is
all
decided
for
us
beforehand
we
are
here
a
moment
and
then
we
are
hammersley
smiled
a
fatalist
then
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
if
there
is
any
chance
of
my
he
was
stopped
abruptly
i
can
tell
you
that
there
is
not
he
said
severely
i
would
have
said
as
much
but
it
was
a
pardonable
curiosity
pardonable
the
man
replied
but
most
unseemly
under
the
you
have
a
deep
sense
of
your
i
obey
my
orders
that
is
all
i
do
not
care
what
others
therefore
you
will
shoot
me
perhaps
he
shrugged
i
am
but
an
instrument
of
he
waved
his
hand
but
i
talk
too
much
and
so
do
you
it
is
not
seemly
in
a
soldier
and
a
hammersley
laughed
you
have
a
fine
sense
of
the
fitness
of
it
was
so
he
relapsed
into
silence
and
in
spite
of
efforts
on
hammersley
s
part
refused
to
speak
further
it
was
only
after
hammersley
badgered
him
for
his
unsociability
that
he
spoke
with
some
asperity
i
will
trouble
you
to
be
quiet
when
i
am
relieved
my
successor
may
let
you
speak
and
laugh
as
much
as
you
please
but
it
is
unnatural
in
a
man
at
the
point
of
death
it
would
be
better
if
you
were
saying
your
i
am
sure
that
you
are
right
but
i
still
have
a
few
hours
perhaps
you
wouldn
t
mind
telling
me
the
hour
at
which
you
are
to
be
relieved
the
hour
when
we
are
both
of
us
to
be
relieved
the
man
gazed
at
him
uncomprehendingly
after
he
finished
indifferently
eight
o
clock
hammersley
was
silent
two
hours
or
more
to
wait
before
a
change
of
guards
and
then
only
a
chance
that
lindberg
would
be
able
to
do
something
even
then
if
he
managed
to
get
loose
there
was
left
little
more
than
an
hour
in
which
to
reach
the
road
by
which
the
machine
would
come
from
berlin
and
even
then
what
should
he
do
without
doris
his
case
was
desperate
only
a
miracle
it
seemed
could
make
a
success
of
what
had
been
a
pitiful
failure
only
an
act
of
providence
could
save
him
from
the
discreditable
end
that
awaited
him
he
drew
up
his
knees
and
studied
the
knots
at
his
ankles
his
guardian
was
the
one
who
had
tied
them
you
tie
a
good
square
knot
my
friend
you
were
once
a
sailor
but
nothing
would
induce
the
soldier
to
talk
as
the
supper
hour
approached
hammersley
could
hear
the
rattle
of
pans
and
dishes
downstairs
and
noticed
the
odor
of
coffee
they
would
not
starve
him
of
course
in
a
little
while
someone
would
come
with
food
after
a
while
which
seemed
interminable
the
noise
of
the
rattling
dishes
ceased
and
there
was
a
sound
at
the
door
into
the
hall
as
the
key
turned
in
the
lock
and
captain
wentz
entered
his
sturdy
back
had
never
seemed
so
ugly
nor
so
welcome
for
the
silence
and
the
inaction
were
getting
on
hammersley
s
nerves
the
officer
came
over
to
the
bed
and
gravely
examined
the
knots
of
the
rope
that
bound
the
prisoner
then
satisfied
with
the
results
of
his
inspection
he
straightened
and
glanced
around
the
room
he
muttered
and
then
to
the
soldier
you
will
go
down
and
tell
lindberg
to
bring
herr
hammersley
s
supper
i
will
stay
here
in
the
meanwhile
you
will
then
relieve
the
man
at
the
door
of
his
the
man
saluted
and
departed
they
still
trusted
lindberg
then
udo
had
suspected
nothing
or
if
he
had
suspected
had
kept
his
thoughts
to
himself
hammersley
lay
back
on
the
pillow
preparing
a
stolid
indifference
for
lindberg
s
entrance
and
when
the
meal
was
brought
wentz
untied
his
hands
and
stood
over
him
with
an
automatic
while
he
ate
your
weapon
makes
a
poor
relish
herr
hauptmann
said
hammersley
with
a
laugh
i
greatly
regret
its
necessity
replied
wentz
with
his
politeness
hammersley
ventured
nothing
further
eating
silently
and
with
a
surprising
appetite
for
good
lindberg
s
face
in
the
background
had
given
him
new
courage
when
the
meal
was
done
he
asked
for
his
pipe
again
and
wentz
ordered
the
forester
to
fill
it
hammersley
inhaled
the
smoke
and
exhaled
a
sigh
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
herr
hauptmann
he
said
with
a
smile
when
this
pipe
is
finished
you
may
kill
me
at
he
extended
his
wrists
behind
him
in
silence
while
captain
wentz
took
half
a
dozen
turns
of
the
rope
and
made
it
fast
hammersley
sat
up
in
bed
puffing
at
his
pipe
and
wondering
whether
some
miracle
might
not
be
induced
that
would
kill
wentz
but
he
was
quickly
disillusioned
for
when
lindberg
took
the
dishes
and
moved
toward
the
door
he
heard
wentz
s
crisp
orders
you
will
send
max
senf
to
take
the
first
night
watch
upon
the
prisoner
he
is
awaiting
my
orders
in
the
guard
room
without
even
a
glance
at
the
prisoner
lindberg
saluted
and
went
out
and
hammersley
s
spirits
fell
help
from
lindberg
was
impossible
von
stromberg
was
taking
every
precaution
there
was
no
way
out
of
it
hammersley
was
doomed
but
while
wentz
was
in
the
room
he
kept
a
cheerful
countenance
though
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
that
he
could
remember
his
pipe
was
acrid
he
saw
the
new
guard
enter
and
heard
the
last
orders
of
the
officer
you
will
watch
until
one
o
clock
when
your
relief
will
be
sent
the
prisoner
is
to
be
allowed
no
privileges
under
no
circumstances
are
his
hands
to
be
untied
if
he
wants
water
you
will
give
it
to
him
with
your
own
hands
sie
the
man
stood
erect
and
saluted
befehl
herr
he
said
hammersley
saw
the
door
close
and
heard
the
key
turn
in
the
lock
while
senf
came
forward
into
the
room
and
stood
by
the
foot
of
the
bed
hammersley
studied
him
closely
a
tall
loosely
jointed
man
in
his
early
thirties
with
the
heavy
brows
and
high
cheekbones
of
the
east
prussian
the
face
of
a
slav
almost
with
something
of
the
thoughtful
intensity
of
the
south
german
mystic
his
eyes
were
large
his
nose
thin
and
his
face
was
bearded
but
the
lines
of
his
mouth
had
a
sensitive
curve
belied
by
the
big
bony
hands
and
broad
shoulders
a
sentimentalist
perhaps
hammersley
determined
to
try
him
for
a
plan
had
been
forming
in
his
mind
he
had
noticed
with
a
glance
which
had
included
everything
in
the
room
when
he
entered
a
bible
upon
the
mantelshelf
and
in
a
tone
which
had
in
it
a
solemn
sense
of
the
doom
which
awaited
him
in
the
morning
he
addressed
his
guardian
quietly
senf
you
have
a
kind
face
there
is
a
small
favor
that
you
may
do
if
it
does
not
conflict
with
my
not
at
all
tomorrow
morning
i
am
to
be
shot
all
i
ask
is
that
you
will
allow
me
to
read
for
a
while
the
bible
upon
the
i
see
no
harm
in
he
went
over
and
got
the
book
opening
the
pages
and
looking
through
them
it
is
little
enough
for
a
dying
man
to
ask
he
said
said
hammersley
quietly
his
face
solemn
but
his
mind
working
rapidly
it
is
but
right
to
make
one
s
peace
with
the
world
at
a
time
like
i
am
sorry
said
the
man
mournfully
it
is
not
good
for
a
man
to
die
in
the
first
flush
of
if
it
could
only
have
been
in
the
open
senf
a
soldier
s
death
but
this
we
can
only
go
once
it
doesn
t
he
gave
a
deep
sigh
and
asked
his
guardian
to
light
his
pipe
again
and
open
the
book
at
the
psalms
of
david
i
can
not
turn
the
pages
my
friend
it
is
a
pity
but
propped
upon
one
elbow
i
can
see
quite
well
if
you
will
but
put
the
candle
here
upon
the
the
man
did
as
requested
and
hammersley
thanked
him
you
are
a
kind
fellow
it
is
bread
upon
the
waters
you
will
find
it
after
many
it
is
nothing
i
would
expect
as
much
from
now
if
you
will
permit
i
would
prefer
the
solitude
of
my
the
soldier
turned
slowly
away
and
hammersley
bent
his
gaze
upon
the
open
page
but
he
did
not
read
he
was
thinking
planning
watching
the
movements
of
max
senf
eight
o
clock
was
long
past
it
must
be
nearly
nine
but
two
hours
remained
before
the
arrival
of
the
messenger
from
berlin
his
guardian
paced
slowly
up
and
down
the
room
between
the
door
and
window
and
hammersley
felt
if
he
did
not
see
his
deep
bovine
gaze
fixed
upon
him
from
time
to
time
eight
or
ten
times
the
man
took
the
length
of
the
room
and
then
with
a
deep
sigh
he
sank
into
the
chair
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
hammersley
did
not
move
his
head
which
remained
bent
forward
over
the
book
but
from
the
tail
of
his
eye
he
noted
that
the
tall
footboard
of
the
bed
partially
concealed
him
propped
up
as
he
was
he
could
see
the
man
s
head
as
far
down
as
the
tip
of
his
nose
but
all
of
his
head
was
in
shadow
arguing
from
this
everything
upon
the
bed
below
the
line
of
the
flame
of
the
candle
was
invisible
to
him
but
a
quick
glance
showed
hammersley
that
the
man
was
not
looking
at
him
his
dark
eyes
were
peering
straight
before
him
at
the
opposite
wall
and
his
mind
was
wrapped
in
some
gloomy
vision
the
plan
he
had
in
mind
required
subtlety
he
marked
the
shadows
upon
the
ceiling
and
moved
up
in
the
bed
so
that
his
own
shadow
would
be
thrown
behind
the
line
of
sight
of
his
guardian
then
he
paused
again
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
pages
waiting
for
senf
to
look
at
him
again
he
heard
the
man
move
in
his
chair
which
creaked
as
he
settled
more
comfortably
into
it
and
when
hammersley
looked
again
only
his
eyes
were
visible
their
gaze
fixed
darkly
ahead
of
him
hammersley
now
puffed
a
volume
of
smoke
from
his
pipe
and
slowly
wriggled
his
left
arm
forward
under
him
so
that
he
could
see
the
knot
that
tied
his
wrists
it
was
a
large
knot
but
vulnerable
he
puffed
more
smoke
meanwhile
watching
the
top
of
the
head
of
senf
as
it
did
not
move
he
lay
over
half
upon
his
back
and
taking
care
not
to
disturb
the
book
slowly
advanced
his
arms
behind
him
toward
the
blaze
of
the
candle
the
knot
of
the
rope
caught
and
blazed
but
the
candle
sputtered
and
he
quickly
withdrew
his
hands
sending
a
volume
of
smoke
from
his
pipe
to
neutralize
the
odor
senf
sniffed
the
air
curiously
something
is
burning
hammersley
heard
him
mutter
my
pipe
he
explained
carefully
it
is
a
vile
tobacco
but
it
will
go
out
of
the
crack
at
the
will
you
not
try
mine
herr
hammersley
perhaps
it
is
no
thanks
nothing
much
matters
to
a
dead
his
guardian
settled
back
in
his
chair
and
hammersley
repeated
his
maneuver
more
daringly
his
own
pipe
seething
like
a
furnace
you
are
a
furious
smoker
herr
hammersley
said
senf
again
it
is
the
way
one
smokes
when
one
smokes
for
the
last
time
he
replied
but
the
fellow
got
up
sniffing
and
walking
around
the
room
it
is
a
most
curious
tobacco
he
muttered
hammersley
s
wrists
pained
him
where
his
bonds
had
cut
but
he
kept
his
gaze
upon
the
page
of
the
book
and
senf
sat
in
his
chair
again
a
strong
pull
of
his
arms
and
hammersley
felt
the
tension
relax
his
bonds
came
looser
and
after
a
few
more
efforts
his
wrists
were
free
his
heart
was
jumping
and
he
feared
a
stray
glance
of
the
watcher
might
see
the
throbbing
of
the
blood
at
his
temples
but
he
clasped
his
hands
behind
him
and
waited
slipping
the
sundered
rope
beneath
a
fold
of
the
blanket
two
three
minutes
passed
and
senf
did
not
move
the
untying
of
his
feet
might
prove
a
difficult
matter
but
he
made
the
venture
working
slowly
and
patiently
his
gaze
on
senf
s
head
then
as
the
knot
yielded
a
little
to
his
prying
fingers
his
gaze
quickly
concentrated
on
it
in
his
efforts
he
must
have
made
a
sound
or
a
suspicious
movement
of
the
shoulders
for
when
he
looked
up
he
saw
the
head
of
max
senf
projecting
above
the
tailboard
of
the
bed
his
large
eyes
protruding
with
amazement
they
gazed
at
each
other
for
a
tense
fraction
of
a
second
and
then
sprang
upright
hammersley
threw
his
feet
out
upon
the
floor
and
leaped
for
the
man
catching
him
around
the
waist
so
that
he
could
not
draw
a
weapon
his
legs
were
useless
and
the
only
chance
he
had
a
desperate
one
at
best
was
to
drag
the
man
to
the
floor
by
sheer
weight
and
there
perhaps
throttle
him
senf
beat
with
his
heavy
fists
on
hammersley
s
head
and
shoulders
and
finally
forced
him
backwards
upon
the
floor
falling
with
him
but
hammersley
still
clung
with
frantic
grip
which
the
man
could
not
shake
off
but
at
last
he
managed
to
get
his
fingers
around
hammersley
s
throat
and
tried
to
force
his
head
back
hammersley
gasped
for
breath
but
still
struggled
gamely
though
he
realized
that
he
had
played
his
last
card
things
got
dark
and
dimly
he
saw
the
door
of
the
room
open
and
someone
enter
wentz
of
course
his
game
was
up
senf
was
panting
heavily
he
burnt
the
rope
hammersley
heard
him
say
come
and
help
me
he
has
a
grip
of
the
figure
from
the
door
moved
quickly
around
the
squirming
figures
and
hammersley
saw
the
reflection
of
the
candle
on
something
bright
a
knife
he
heard
a
blow
and
the
mass
of
struggling
flesh
above
him
suddenly
collapsed
and
smothered
him
with
its
weight
with
an
effort
he
struggled
free
and
rolled
aside
looking
up
into
the
grim
face
of
lindberg
sh
the
man
whispered
i
had
to
do
it
there
was
no
other
way
i
ve
been
waiting
hammersley
tried
to
speak
but
his
throat
closed
and
while
he
struggled
for
his
breath
he
saw
lindberg
go
to
the
door
and
stand
his
ear
to
the
keyhole
listening
in
a
moment
he
came
back
gut
they
have
heard
are
you
sure
hammersley
managed
to
gasp
as
lindberg
cut
the
rope
that
bound
his
ankles
yes
he
was
so
sure
of
himself
that
he
did
not
he
helped
the
prisoner
to
his
feet
and
they
clasped
hands
good
lindberg
my
friend
i
had
given
i
have
waited
until
the
beer
was
served
it
is
well
and

looked
around
the
room
quickly

had
a
sudden

lindberg
meanwhile
had
been
unstrapping
his
pistol
holster
and
put
it
on
a
chair
hammersley
glanced
over
his
shoulder
at
the
door
but
they
may
come
again
he
whispered
i
think
not
there
is
little
time
to
lose
we
will
have
to
take
the
but
if
they
return
and

free
it
will
only

death
and

herr
hammersley
you
should

by
this
time
that
i
do
not
waste
words

i

i
have
made
a
plan

this
is
my
story
for
herr
hauptmann

in
the
hallway
without
carrying
a
pitcher
of
water
to
the
room
of
miss
mather
the
pitcher
is
outside
on
the
table
when
i
hear
the
sounds
of
a
commotion
in
this
room
fearing
that
the
prisoner

some
miracle
gotten
free

the
door
with

and

paused
and
you
hammersley
broke
in
you

be
left
here

won
t
leave
you
not
to
that
fate
i
will
not
go
unless

way
to
get
out
of
the
nein
will
you
not
listen

i
not
told
you

i
have
thought
of
everything
i
have
communicated
with
the
lady
she
is
ready
to
go
with
you
her
room
has
a
dormer
window
around
the
corner
of
the
building
and
there
is
a
ledge
along
the
roof
you
will
go
to
her
the
distance
to
the
roof
of
the
kitchen
is
thirty
feet
it
will
require
four
sheets
yours
and
hers
they
are
new
ones
and
if
well
twisted
will
hold
if
you
get
away
safely
you
can
reach
the
cave
in
the
thorwald
no
one
will
ever
find
you
there
yes
lindberg
but
you
what
will

say
to
them
it
is
no
time
to
waste
words
even
now
the
lady
is
waiting
for
you
come
you
must
get
ready
at
he
walked
to
the
bed
and
quickly
stripped
off
the
blankets
twisting
the
sheets
and
tying
them
together
then
he
took
his
pistol
belt
and
fastened
it
around
hammersley
s
waist
slipping
a
handful
of
loose
cartridges
into
the
side
pocket
of
his
leather
jacket
hammersley
bewildered
by
the
devotion
of
his
old
friend
and
tossed
between
alternatives
of
duty
stood
helplessly
at
the
moment
when
he
needed
resolution
most
he
was
supine
but
the
minutes
were
passing
the
thought
of
his
mission
suddenly
brought
him
to
life
and
his
face
grew
hard
his
eyes
brilliant
with
purpose
come
lindberg
you
must
go
with
no
the
man
insisted
my
plan
is
the
no
you
must
come
with
i
have
made
other
plans
herr
hammersley
he
whispered
gently
you
will
go
alone
i
will
give
you
a
and
before
hammersley
could
know
what
he
meant
to
do
he
drew
his
from
its
sheath
in
hammersley
s
belt
and
plunged
it
into
his
own
shoulder
hammersley
could
scarcely
restrain
a
cry
but
lindberg
smiled
at
him
and
plucking
the
weapon
out
put
it
in
hammersley
s
outstretched
hand
it
is
nothing
he
said
it
will
bleed
a
little
the
more
it
bleeds
the
better
my
case
with
excellenz
they
will
be
here
in
three
hours
if
not
before
now
bind
and
gag
me
quick
there
is
no
time
to
he
lay
flat
upon
the
floor
and
as
in
a
dream
hammersley
obeyed
him
tying
his
arms
and
legs
when
he
had
finished
hammersley
bent
over
the
man
and
touched
his
hand
gently
old
friend
whatever
happens
i
will
not
forget
god
bless
there
was
a
bright
keen
look
in
the
small
gray
eyes
upturned
to
his
that
was
all
hammersley
could
see
of
the
swathed
head
but
it
gave
him
a
new
idea
of
chapter
xviii
success
hammersley
s
first
act
was
to
take
off
his
shoes
and
slip
one
into
each
pocket
of
his
jacket
they
were
soled
with
rubber
but
even
that
he
feared
would
make
a
sound
then
he
put
the
box
of
matches
in
his
pocket
and
blew
out
the
candle
overturning
it
on
the
floor
the
shutters
of
the
window
were
closed
and
if
they
were
opened
carefully
the
man
in
the
garden
below
might
not
notice
any
change
in
the
appearance
of
the
window
hammersley
buttoned
his
jacket
and
carefully
pushing
back
the
shutter
peered
out
fortunately
the
night
had
fallen
darkly
and
overhead
black
clouds
were
lowering
and
while
he
hesitated
searching
the
paths
below
for
the
figure
of
the
guard
there
was
a
patter
of
rain
upon
the
roof
the
gods
were
propitious
at
last
he
made
out
a
dark
bulk
moving
to
and
fro
along
the
garden
path
toward
the
toolhouse
hammersley
watched
waiting
until
the
man
s
back
was
turned
when
he
opened
the
shutter
wider
and
threw
the
rope
of
sheets
out
upon
the
ledge
closing
the
shutter
again
he
came
toward
the
house
so
far
so
good
for
the
whiteness
of
the
sheets
would
have
been
plainly
visible
had
the
guard
been
looking
the
next
stage
of
his
escape
was
more
difficult
and
he
let
the
fellow
go
and
come
twice
along
his
path
as
he
timed
his
new
move
he
tried
the
shutter
carefully
to
see
that
it
did
not
creak
and
measured
with
his
eye
the
distance
to
the
chimney
which
he
must
reach
during
the
twenty
paces
the
soldier
would
take
toward
the
toolhouse
a
wind
was
blowing
in
the
treetops
and
somewhere
below
him
a
young
oak
was
rustling
its
last
year
s
leaves
the
shutter
fortunately
opened
in
the
direction
in
which
he
must
go
so
he
sat
upon
the
doubled
up
and
when
the
time
came
without
looking
again
at
the
guard
moved
quickly
slipping
out
noiselessly
closing
the
shutter
behind
him
and
gathering
up
the
sheet
as
he
went
crept
like
a
cat
on
a
wall
along
the
narrow
ledge
it
creaked
with
his
weight
and
some
small
object
that
his
foot
had
touched
grated
along
the
roof
and
fell
to
the
ground
below
a
tiny
sound
at
best
but
magnified
in
hammersley
s
ears
a
hundred
times
he
had
reached
the
wide
chimney
and
waited
above
it
listening
for
the
footsteps
of
the
man
below
there
was
no
sound
the
man
had
stopped
walking
hammersley
did
not
dare
look
out
from
his
but
he
knew
that
in
that
moment
his
fate
was
hanging
in
a
balance
just
then
a
heavier
gust
of
wind
than
usual
dislodged
a
broken
branch
from
a
tree
nearby
which
fell
to
the
ground
still
the
man
below
did
not
move
and
hammersley
blessed
his
wisdom
in
closing
the
shutter
for
he
knew
that
the
guard
must
be
peering
upward
searching
for
a
sign
of
anything
unusual
in
its
appearance
hammersley
held
his
breath
straining
his
ears
for
the
sound
that
would
tell
him
that
he
had
not
failed
in
a
while
which
seemed
interminable
it
began
again
the
slow
crunch
of
gravel
under
a
heavy
foot
ceased
and
began
again
as
though
uncertainly
so
he
waited
until
the
sounds
were
regular
as
before
then
advancing
his
head
cautiously
he
waited
for
the
proper
time
and
keeping
the
chimney
between
himself
and
the
garden
ran
straight
up
the
roof
to
the
gable
and
crouched
quickly
upon
the
other
side
he
was
more
fortunate
this
time
for
the
roof
gave
forth
no
sound
once
beyond
the
protection
of
the
gables
he
could
for
the
moment
disregard
the
danger
of
the
guard
for
his
orders
had
been
to
watch
but
one
window
and
hammersley
knew
enough
of
the
german
character
to
be
sure
that
the
soldier
below
would
not
leave
that
side
of
the
house
as
he
slid
carefully
down
the
roof
upon
the
other
side
he
saw
that
there
were
two
dormers
and
for
a
moment
could
not
think
which
of
them
let
into
the
room
in
which
doris
was
imprisoned
he
reached
the
ledge
and
paused
the
shutters
of
both
windows
were
closed
lindberg
had
told
him
this
but
he
swore
mildly
to
himself
because
he
hadn
t
paid
closer
attention
to
the
forester
s
instructions
for
while
one
of
the
rooms
was
doris
s
the
other
he
knew
was
to
be
occupied
by
john
rizzio
it
was
while
he
hesitated
that
he
heard
a
whisper
at
his
left
and
crawling
along
the
ledge
in
a
moment
had
reached
the
window
is
it
you
cyril
he
heard
yes
he
whispered
let
me
lindberg
had
opened
the
shutter
in
the
afternoon
but
it
was
still
stubborn
and
when
cyril
put
his
strength
to
doris
s
it
creaked
abominably
it
was
not
really
a
loud
noise
but
to
the
sensitive
ears
of
the
fugitives
it
seemed
as
if
discovery
must
be
inevitable
at
last
they
managed
to
open
it
wide
enough
to
admit
cyril
s
long
legs
and
his
body
speedily
followed
inside
the
room
they
stood
their
hands
clasped
fearful
of
discovery
listening
for
sounds
without
or
within
which
would
tell
them
of
the
approach
of
the
dreaded
wentz
nothing
but
the
sighing
of
the
wind
in
the
treetops
and
the
patter
of
the
rain
as
hope
returned
hammersley
questioned
quickly
you
are
ready
to
go
yes
she
replied
eagerly
the
sheets
here
i
have
it
was
dark
and
he
could
not
see
but
he
followed
the
sheet
to
its
end
with
his
hand
and
found
that
it
was
fastened
to
the
bedpost
how
she
had
managed
to
move
the
heavy
bed
across
the
room
he
did
not
know
and
it
was
unnecessary
to
question
for
there
it
was
he
reassured
himself
as
to
the
knot
that
she
had
made
and
then
fastened
his
own
sheets
to
the
other
end
do
you
think
you
can
manage
it
alone
it
will
not
hold
us
try
me
she
whispered
bravely
the
rope
will
reach
almost
to
the
kitchen
yes
it
is
just
below
i
could
see
the
edge
of
it
through
the
shutter
this
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
their
lips
met
i
will
go
first
then
when
the
tension
relaxes
you
she
pressed
his
hand
as
he
slid
his
feet
out
of
the
window
and
paused
crouching
on
the
ledge
listening
then
he
waved
his
hand
and
slowly
went
down
he
knew
that
the
angle
of
the
building
quite
hid
him
from
the
garden
path
and
he
slid
down
the
improvised
rope
as
quickly
as
he
could
until
his
feet
dangled
in
space
he
looked
below
him
but
in
the
darkness
the
distance
was
uncertain
had
lindberg
miscalculated
or
had
doris
used
too
much
of
the
sheet
at
the
upper
end
he
let
himself
down
until
his
hands
groped
the
end
of
the
sheet
while
he
felt
for
a
landing
with
his
toes
he
touched
nothing
and
still
swayed
and
spun
in
the
air
like
an
apple
on
a
string
at
all
hallowe
en
a
fine
mark
for
an
automatic
from
any
of
the
windows
that
stared
blankly
at
him
from
the
second
story
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
drop
stretching
his
toes
down
to
meet
the
impact
fortunately
it
was
not
far
but
he
lost
his
balance
and
toppled
sideways
catching
himself
upon
an
arm
and
knee
here
again
the
wind
saved
him
from
discovery
but
he
drew
his
weapon
and
kept
a
look
on
the
corner
of
the
garden
meanwhile
watching
for
doris
she
came
at
once
slowly
but
fearlessly
and
in
a
moment
he
had
her
safely
in
his
arms
drawing
her
back
near
the
bulk
of
the
building
to
crouch
and
wait
and
listen
again
they
did
not
dare
to
speak
but
hammersley
s
blood
was
surging
madly
with
hope
if
they
had
not
been
discovered
now
the
chances
were
that
some
time
would
elapse
enough
at
least
to
enable
the
fugitives
to
get
a
good
start
of
their
pursuers
but
the
dangling
sheet
warned
hammersley
that
they
must
move
quickly
he
peered
over
the
edge
of
the
roof
a
light
was
burning
in
the
kitchen
but
whether
the
room
was
occupied
or
not
he
could
not
tell
he
did
not
dare
risk
a
sprained
ankle
by
jumping
but
found
that
by
lowering
himself
he
could
easily
reach
the
fuel
box
that
stood
near
the
kitchen
door
in
a
moment
they
were
on
the
ground
and
moving
along
in
the
shelter
of
the
hedge
toward
the
hangar
hammersley
exulted
it
was
something
to
have
brought
doris
away
but
it
was
something
more
to
have
circumvented
von
stromberg
the
bundled
figure
of
lindberg
lying
up
there
bleeding
in
the
dark
shot
a
pain
through
his
heart
but
in
action
moving
toward
the
goal
of
his
hopes
even
lindberg
was
put
behind
him
he
had
no
fear
for
the
wound
in
lindberg
s
shoulder
the
old
man
was
as
tough
as
a
pine
knot
and
would
survive
the
loss
of
blood
it
was
lindberg
s
ordeal
with
von
stromberg
that
bothered
him
when
they
reached
the
shelter
of
the
woods
the
tension
relaxed
we
re
going
to
get
off
doris
he
said
joyously
i
know
every
stick
of
these
woods
and
they
can
never
find
us
but
i
m
afraid
the
strain
has
been
too
much
for
you
how
are
you
feeling
never
better
she
said
bravely
which
way
now
hammersley
had
paused
a
moment
to
slip
on
his
shoes
and
as
he
got
to
his
feet
follow
me
he
said
if
i
go
too
fast
for
you
let
me
he
cut
into
the
woods
and
presently
struck
a
path
which
led
to
the
left
and
for
a
while
they
followed
this
rapidly
thanks
to
a
fine
physique
and
a
vigorous
life
the
girl
was
in
good
condition
and
though
breathing
hard
upon
the
slopes
made
no
murmur
hammersley
knew
that
he
had
little
time
to
spare
and
doris
followed
blindly
asking
no
questions
she
was
aware
from
what
cyril
had
said
in
the
afternoon
that
his
objective
in
coming
to
germany
was
now
within
reach
and
she
could
only
judge
of
its
importance
to
england
by
the
desperate
chances
he
had
taken
when
it
was
time
that
she
should
know
he
would
tell
her
she
judged
that
cyril
knew
that
she
had
been
tricked
into
betraying
him
and
she
made
up
her
mind
that
whatever
happened
now
she
would
stay
with
him
until
the
end
she
owed
him
that
after
a
while
when
they
had
been
moving
for
perhaps
twenty
minutes
they
reached
an
opening
in
the
trees
where
she
could
see
gray
patches
of
sky
through
the
branches
overhead
and
her
feet
emerging
from
the
dry
leaves
and
moss
felt
a
firmer
contact
the
schÃ¶ndorf
road
he
said
we
can
follow
it
side
by
side
are
you
tired
they
went
on
more
rapidly
while
hammersley
explained
the
documents
i
came
to
germany
for
are
to
be
brought
along
this
road
tonight
in
an
automobile
the
hour
they
are
due
to
reach
blaufelden
is
eleven
and
if
i
know
anything
of
the
infallibility
of
the
german
secret
messenger
they
will
be
here
on
time
it
is
now
after
ten
i
have
an
hour
or
less
to
make
my
what
are
you
going
to
do
she
asked
get
them
first
i
m
going
to
take
you
to
a
spot
where
you
will
be
as
safe
as
if
you
were
at
home
in
ashwater
no
she
said
firmly
i
m
going
with
but
that
s
impossible
i
don
t
know
what
may
happen
my
plans
are
of
the
vaguest
i
will
share
them
no
you
sha
n
t
refuse
me
i
will
follow
you
i
can
help
i
must
i
would
die
in
those
roads
alone
don
t
you
understand
but
if
i
fail
and
they
take
you
you
will
be
as
guilty
as
it
s
an
act
of
war
then
all
the
more
reason
why
i
should
be
committed
to
it
they
made
war
on
but
there
will
be
danger
i
can
t
let
you
take
the
i
don
t
know
how
you
are
going
to
stop
me
she
said
defiantly
he
paused
then
stopped
and
caught
her
by
the
elbows
peering
down
into
her
eyes
then
he
laughed
mated
he
cried
this
is
the
greatest
moment
of
my
and
mine
her
voice
answered
him
her
lips
met
his
in
a
quick
caress
like
those
the
wives
of
the
spartans
gave
when
they
sent
their
men
to
battle
he
caught
her
hand
in
his
and
they
moved
forward
more
quickly
along
this
path
death
was
riding
toward
them
but
they
strode
eagerly
to
meet
it
to
defy
it
to
defeat
it
cyril
planned
rapidly
casting
anxious
glances
along
the
road
behind
them
every
foot
they
traveled
took
them
further
from
pursuers
if
pursuers
there
were
every
foot
they
traveled
took
them
nearer
the
advancing
messenger
so
that
the
farther
they
went
the
longer
would
be
the
while
before
they
were
overtaken
but
the
shorter
the
time
for
preparation
to
stop
the
automobile
murder
was
not
in
hammersley
s
line
they
passed
many
places
difficult
spots
in
the
road
where
the
machine
must
almost
stop
and
go
into
low
gear
to
climb
declivities
places
where
projecting
rocks
jutted
rough
faces
up
to
the
very
ruts
of
the
road
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
kill
with
an
automatic
at
a
distance
of
two
paces
but
hammersley
could
not
play
the
game
that
way
he
was
a
spy
if
the
laws
of
war
called
him
so
but
he
would
not
even
in
this
extremity
use
the
spy
s
weapons
if
the
other
man
fought
it
would
be
different
the
desperate
nature
of
the
undertaking
was
beginning
to
come
to
him
two
men
perhaps
three
or
even
four
and
yet
he
must
win
he
must
slowly
but
surely
a
plan
was
forming
and
he
made
up
his
mind
to
put
it
into
practice
not
tired
yet
he
asked
no
i
could
go
on
then
listen
we
are
nearing
the
thorwald
it
is
just
beyond
here
less
than
half
a
mile
the
thorwald
it
s
a
favorite
place
of
mine
known
only
to
lindberg
and
udo
a
cave
high
up
in
the
rocks
safe
as
a
church
unless
udo
happens
to
hunt
for
us
and
will
he
i
hope
not
at
the
foot
of
the
crags
this
road
runs
we
must
get
there
first
can
you
run
i
ll
he
gave
her
his
hand
again
and
they
settled
into
a
jog
trot
she
was
breathing
fast
in
a
moment
but
she
was
game
and
did
not
falter
though
her
lungs
seemed
to
be
bursting
but
as
they
neared
the
spot
cyril
slowed
down
to
a
walk
again
at
the
foot
of
the
glen
there
s
a
dry
bed
of
a
stream
full
of
rocks
there
used
to
be
a
bridge
here
but
it
was
washed
away
it
s
an
awkward
spot
even
for
a
good
motor
i
m
going
to
make
it
he
left
her
dashing
on
ahead
while
she
followed
and
when
she
reached
the
stream
she
saw
him
dragging
one
of
the
bridge
timbers
across
the
road
she
wanted
to
help
but
he
told
her
to
watch
until
he
got
another
and
then
another
timber
into
place
and
in
another
moment
it
was
evident
that
the
barricade
was
formidable
enough
to
deter
any
machine
from
crossing
and
there
was
no
way
to
go
around
for
upon
one
side
rose
the
crags
and
upon
the
other
the
gully
fell
away
into
a
dark
pit
filled
with
rocks
and
tangled
branches
there
was
nothing
for
it
now
but
to
wait
and
yet
it
seemed
a
desperate
thing
to
do
weary
and
blown
as
doris
was
it
would
have
seemed
better
to
have
gone
on
and
on
anything
to
put
distance
between
cyril
and
the
death
that
surely
awaited
them
back
there
it
seemed
impossible
that
so
long
a
time
as
this
could
have
elapsed
before
the
rope
of
sheets
should
have
been
discovered
already
she
was
sure
that
wentz
and
his
men
must
be
on
the
way
in
a
machine
or
on
horses
perhaps
which
would
cover
the
distance
they
had
traveled
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
the
time
she
thought
that
she
heard
the
sound
of
a
machine
in
the
distance
and
the
voices
of
men
she
pleaded
with
him
to
go
on
but
he
only
smiled
at
her
you
must
do
what
i
say
doris
he
said
and
then
paused
listening
they
re
coming
he
whispered
she
heard
the
sound
of
a
machine
from
which
direction
she
gasped
there
and
he
pointed
across
the
gully
they
ll
be
here
in
a
moment
listen
to
me
walk
quickly
to
your
right
across
the
road
to
that
large
stone
stop
she
obeyed
wonderingly
now
cross
the
road
again
using
those
rocks
as
stepping
she
did
it
bewildered
pausing
on
a
ledge
of
rocks
that
formed
a
part
of
the
crag
now
follow
the
line
of
the
rocks
into
the
bushes
fifty
feet
from
the
road
hidden
among
the
shrubbery
you
ll
find
a
cleft
in
the
rocks
climb
it
and
you
ll
come
out
here
and
he
pointed
upward
just
above
the
road
wait
for
me
there
i
ll
come
in
a
and
as
she
hesitated
he
caught
her
by
the
elbows
and
shoved
her
along
the
ledge
backwards
go
do
you
hear
i
ll
have
no
there
was
no
denying
the
accent
of
command
in
his
voice
or
the
quick
flash
of
his
eye
never
until
von
stromberg
had
badgered
her
today
had
a
man
spoken
to
her
in
this
tone
before
but
she
loved
him
for
it
rejoiced
in
his
strength
the
primitive
instinct
of
woman
to
obey
when
she
had
gone
hammersley
quickly
crossed
the
stream
and
took
a
position
behind
a
thick
bush
listening
to
the
exhaust
of
the
approaching
machine
but
listening
and
looking
too
in
the
opposite
direction
for
sounds
of
his
pursuers
a
searchlight
made
fantastic
shapes
among
the
leaves
and
long
shadows
suddenly
shot
out
along
the
road
hammersley
had
drawn
his
automatic
from
his
pocket
and
was
fingering
it
coolly
he
put
his
fingers
over
his
eyes
so
that
the
light
would
not
mar
his
familiarity
with
the
darkness
he
did
not
know
how
many
men
opposed
him
and
did
not
seem
to
care
the
main
thing
now
was
to
keep
his
eye
undimmed
and
his
hand
steady
the
machine
came
slowed
down
and
stopped
while
a
guttural
exclamation
came
from
the
driver
the
searchlight
focused
downward
into
the
rocks
of
the
gully
screening
his
eyes
from
its
light
with
a
hand
hammersley
peered
out
at
the
occupants
of
the
car
there
were
two
men
better
than
three
but
not
so
good
as
one
the
man
at
the
wheel
rose
and
got
down
just
beside
him
moving
forward
to
remove
the
obstacles
hammersley
wasted
no
time
he
leveled
his
automatic
at
the
broad
back
of
the
driver
and
his
voice
rang
sharply
in
german
i
have
come
here
for
the
dispatches
intended
for
herr
general
von
stromberg
you
will
give
them
to
me
at
the
man
who
was
just
bending
over
toward
the
timber
straightened
quickly
and
turned
reaching
for
his
holster
but
the
man
in
the
seat
of
the
car
who
wore
a
military
cap
was
quicker
for
there
was
a
report
and
a
bullet
sang
close
to
hammersley
s
ear
a
stream
of
fire
came
from
hammersley
s
automatic
three
shots
in
quick
succession
and
the
man
in
the
car
pitched
forward
in
his
seat
and
slid
to
the
floor
and
by
the
time
the
other
man
had
drawn
his
pistol
hammersley
had
leaped
behind
a
tree
and
came
out
of
some
bushes
beyond
the
chauffeur
fired
but
not
in
hammersley
s
direction
the
continuous
glare
of
the
light
in
their
eyes
had
made
their
vision
in
the
darkness
uncertain
do
you
surrender
shouted
hammersley
the
german
s
reply
was
to
fire
at
him
again
and
miss
he
still
stood
in
the
reflection
of
the
headlight
a
bulky
silhouette
which
made
too
fair
a
mark
while
hammersley
stood
in
the
shadows
of
the
bushes
hammersley
pitied
him
surrender
he
repeated
the
man
was
not
a
coward
and
rushed
blindly
toward
the
voice
shooting
again
too
close
for
comfort
well
then
hammersley
said
and
fired
again
the
man
stumbled
to
his
knees
and
then
fell
prone
his
fingers
clutching
among
the
leaves
the
whole
incident
had
taken
less
than
a
minute
and
a
deathly
silence
seemed
to
fall
following
the
reverberations
of
the
shots
hammersley
stood
tensely
listening
and
peering
along
the
road
toward
blaufelden
there
was
a
glow
of
light
at
a
distance
and
he
could
now
hear
the
sound
of
another
machine
von
stromberg
had
learned
of
his
escape
and
with
a
perfect
intuition
was
coming
here
directly
and
fast
the
sound
of
the
shots
had
been
heard
there
was
no
time
to
lose
hammersley
bent
over
the
man
on
the
ground
and
searched
his
pockets
rapidly
gloves
matches
a
spark
plug
tobacco
but
no
papers
the
chauffeur
of
course
by
main
strength
he
lifted
the
dead
weight
of
the
man
in
the
car
and
carried
him
down
into
the
glare
of
the
searchlight
it
was
a
dangerous
thing
to
do
for
the
lights
of
the
machine
from
blaufelden
were
already
swinging
through
the
treetrunks
but
he
worked
quickly
and
skillfully
tearing
open
the
officer
s
gray
overcoat
and
searching
his
pockets
in
the
inside
pocket
of
his
uniform
he
found
them
a
bulky
package
and
other
papers
he
read
the
superscription
quickly
excellenz
general
graf
von
then
sprang
aside
out
of
the
glare
of
the
lights
at
the
very
moment
when
the
other
machine
came
swinging
rapidly
around
the
turn
in
the
road
the
papers
are
safe
roared
a
voice
which
hammersley
recognized
hammersley
replied
in
a
rough
tone
a
man
tried
to
stop
me
and
i
shot
gut
he
is
here
shouted
hammersley
again
all
the
while
he
had
been
moving
out
of
the
glare
of
the
searchlights
and
as
the
men
from
the
other
car
tumbled
out
and
came
forward
he
turned
into
the
darkness
and
abandoning
all
caution
took
to
his
heels
and
ran
at
top
speed
in
the
opposite
direction
behind
him
he
heard
shouts
as
his
trick
was
discovered
but
he
knew
that
in
the
matter
of
speed
he
had
nothing
to
fear
afoot
from
any
german
at
windenberg
the
thing
that
bothered
him
now
was
a
way
to
hide
the
marks
of
his
footsteps
for
in
places
the
mud
was
soft
and
he
knew
that
in
the
morning
light
they
would
follow
him
so
he
picked
his
way
carefully
running
at
top
speed
for
a
mile
at
least
to
lead
the
pursuit
away
from
the
thorwald
and
then
at
the
banks
of
a
small
stream
paused
a
moment
and
listened
he
had
eluded
them
then
without
hesitation
though
puffing
fearfully
from
his
exertions
he
stepped
down
into
the
cold
waters
of
the
stream
and
waded
up
it
avoiding
the
ledges
and
making
sure
that
he
left
no
mark
behind
him
as
he
climbed
higher
up
the
mountain
he
could
see
in
the
distance
the
glow
of
the
lights
of
the
machines
and
when
he
reached
a
mossy
bank
which
would
not
betray
him
he
clambered
out
of
the
water
and
turned
doubling
like
a
fox
upon
his
trail
turning
back
in
the
general
direction
from
which
he
had
come
doris
worried
him
he
could
imagine
her
crouching
there
two
hundred
feet
in
the
air
just
above
the
two
machines
half
dead
with
fear
of
capture
and
terror
for
him
had
she
seen
what
had
happened
and
understood
it
would
she
have
the
kind
of
silent
endurance
to
crouch
there
and
wait
he
hurried
on
into
the
maze
of
rocks
and
deep
woods
finding
at
last
a
deer
trail
that
he
knew
there
were
but
two
means
of
ingress
to
the
cave
of
the
thorwald
one
by
the
secret
path
in
the
bushes
up
the
rocks
which
doris
had
taken
the
other
from
the
upper
side
which
he
was
now
rapidly
approaching
he
ran
along
the
deer
trail
reloading
his
automatic
as
he
went
his
eyes
peering
ahead
for
familiar
landmarks
cutting
in
at
last
to
the
left
at
a
great
rock
around
which
the
deer
trail
led
he
now
proceeded
with
great
caution
far
below
him
he
could
see
the
reflections
of
the
lights
of
the
two
cars
and
heard
the
voices
of
men
he
went
down
a
way
toward
the
wall
of
rocks
clambering
over
huge
bowlders
hauling
himself
here
and
there
by
the
aid
of
tree
limbs
reaching
at
last
the
dry
bed
of
the
old
stream
which
down
in
the
road
had
been
of
such
assistance
to
him
now
the
wall
of
rock
rose
sheer
before
him
he
stole
cautiously
along
its
face
feeling
with
his
hands
and
peering
upward
in
a
moment
he
found
what
he
was
looking
for
a
small
projecting
ledge
which
he
mounted
and
followed
to
his
right
for
a
way
then
mounting
again
by
easy
stages
to
a
fissure
wider
than
his
body
which
he
entered
and
followed
quickly
it
led
downward
it
seemed
into
the
bowels
of
the
crag
but
came
out
suddenly
into
an
open
space
a
kind
of
amphitheater
with
a
ridge
of
rock
upon
one
side
and
upon
the
other
what
appeared
to
be
a
solid
wall
he
crossed
this
space
quickly
and
peered
over
below
him
the
crag
jutted
out
over
the
road
and
upon
it
somewhere
was
doris
he
strained
his
gaze
downward
but
could
not
see
her
what
if
they
had
found
her
footsteps
and
followed
no
that
was
hardly
possible
for
the
ridge
of
rock
began
immediately
at
the
road
and
thanks
to
his
precautions
she
would
leave
no
footprints
slowly
he
descended
choosing
his
footing
with
quick
deliberation
for
the
slightest
sound
the
dislodging
of
a
twig
or
a
sliver
of
crumbled
stone
and
the
crag
of
the
thorwald
would
become
in
a
moment
a
hornet
s
nest
fortunately
the
back
of
the
rock
screened
him
from
the
road
and
unless
von
stromberg
had
sent
men
into
the
woods
to
left
and
right
there
was
no
chance
of
discovery
at
last
he
reached
the
level
and
a
dark
shadow
rose
at
his
very
feet
and
silently
clasped
his
hand
he
took
her
in
his
arms
for
a
moment
in
devout
thankfulness
if
the
true
moment
of
their
mating
had
been
back
there
in
the
road
while
danger
threatened
them
before
and
behind
this
place
of
security
was
the
beginning
of
its
consummation
he
did
not
speak
and
only
motioned
her
to
sit
while
he
crouched
beside
her
waiting
below
in
the
road
he
heard
the
rasping
voice
of
his
excellenz
speaking
in
no
gentle
tones
to
the
wounded
chauffeur
of
the
messenger
s
machine
asking
question
after
question
which
were
answered
feebly
enough
after
a
while
the
men
who
had
followed
hammersley
returned
and
made
their
reports
the
dull
boom
of
the
voice
of
wentz
and
the
harsh
crackle
of
von
stromberg
s
in
rage
and
mortification
he
got
away

wentz
for
a
moment
only
i
saw
him

followed

i
could

my
legs
are

bah
you
are
an
imbecile
herr
hauptmann
and
the
other
men
are
not
their
legs
longer
yes
but
herr
hammersley
has
the
legs
of
a
deer
they
are
following
but
it
is
like
hunting
for
a
grain
of
barley
in
a
coal
scuttle
he
may
have
taken
to
the
woods
but
the
frÃ¤ulein
she
could
not
have
run
as
fast
as
he
it
is
my
opinion
said
wentz
with
some
temerity
that
they
had
a
somewhere
beyond
he
has
known
these
mountains
since
his
but
she
hasn
t
and
how
should
she
find
it
in
the
dark
perhaps
the
matter
being
so
important
he
would
have
deserted
find
me
the
girl
and
i
will
find
you
hammersley
felt

tighten
on
his
own

can
not
have
gotten
far
away
search
for
her
search
the
woods
and
rocks
until
morning
take
the
other
machine
and
follow
his
footsteps
until
you
see
them
no
more
then
follow
his
trail
in
the
woods
take
the
two
with
you
i
will
go
back
to
blaufelden
to
send
for
more
men
and
question
the
guards

permitted

escape

the
fugitives
sat
silently
listening
to
the
sounds
below
them
heard
the
orders
to
put
the
wounded
man
and
the
dead
messenger
into
the
machine
and
presently
the
commotion
of
departure
as
the
machines
were
backed
away
from
the
gully
turned
in
available
spots
and
then
departed

opposite
directions

while

wentz
walked
on
before
his
shoulders
bent
trying
to
follow
the
signs
of
hammersley
s
rubber
soles
in
the
road
but
it
had
begun
to
rain
steadily
again
and
hammersley
was
thankful
for
it
would
not
be
long
before
all
marks
of
his
footsteps
would
be
erased
chapter

the
cave
on
the
thorwald
safe
he
heard
her
whisper
yes
for
the
you
have
what
you
came
for
i
think
and
what
shall
we
do
now
sleep
you
re
dead

he
rose
and
helped
her
to
her
feet
then
after
another
pause
turned
toward
the
wall
of
rocks
behind
them
do
you
think
you
can
make
it
it
s
a
difficult
yes
i
ve
that
much
left
in
me
you
lead
the
way
and
i
ll
her
teeth
were
chattering
as
he
touched
her
sleeve
he
found
it
soaked
with
moisture
poor
child
you
re
nearly
he
had
not
been
conscious
of
the
occasional
spatter
of
rain
for
his
leather
jacket
had
kept
him
dry
but
i
ll
have
you
warm
and
snug
before
you
can
say
and
when
she
questioned
a
fire
he
replied
isn
t
that
what
one
uses
to
get
warm
with
but
here
tonight
oh
don
t
bother
you
ll
they
were
climbing
up
the
face
of
the
slippery
rocks
hammersley
pausing
from
time
to
time
to
let
her
rest
pulling
her
from
above
when
he
reached
the
ledges
and
at
last
they
came
out
into
the
amphitheater
of
bowlders
from
which
he
had
descended
she
was
almost
too
weary
for
comment
and
followed
blindly
as
he
led
her
to
the
wall
of
the
rock
where
he
seemed
to
disappear
in
its
very
face
she
followed
him
inside
a
dark
opening
and
when
they
were
well
within
he
relinquished
her
hand
and
struck
a
match
a
brief
glimpse
she
had
of
a
small
chamber
in
the
cliff
not
twenty
feet
square
when
the
match
went
out
he
struck
another
and
shading
it
with
his
hand
went
forward
she
saw
him
find
what
he
was
looking
for
and
in
a
moment
a
candle
after
faintly
sputtering
for
a
moment
sent
forth
a
steady
glow
of
light
sit
here
on
this
stool
i
ll
have
you
right
in
a
she
obeyed
him
and
looked
around
her
at
one
side
was
a
bed
of
pine
needles
at
another
a
small
table
and
in
the
middle
of
the
rocky
floor
the
gray
embers
of
what
had
been
a
fire
a
bit
roughish
but
not
so
bad
she
nodded
while
he
busied
himself
in
building
the
fire
there
were
dry
leaves
twigs
and
logs
in
the
corner
and
soon
a
blaze
was
leaping
cheerfully
upward
and
while
she
wondered
at
the
signs
of
occupancy
he
answered
her
thought
it
s
lindberg
s
he
comes
here
often
it
was
here
that
he
and
i
always
slept
when
we
went
on
hunting
trips
you
see
there
s
a
natural
chimney
overhead
in
the
rocks
where
the
bally
smoke
goes
out
they
might
observe
the
smoke
by
day
but
at
night
we
re
quite
safe
i
ve
been
all
around
the
place
when
the
fire
was
goin
and
there
isn
t
a
sign
of
it
he
helped
her
put
her
coat
off
and
made
her
comfortable
close
to
the
fire
after
which
he
quickly
took
the
package
of
papers
out
of
his
pocket
and
examined
them
the
single
papers
were
military
orders
of
no
importance
to
one
lieutenant
orstmann
obviously
the
dead
messenger
hammersley
put
them
aside
breaking
the
seal
of
the
heavy
envelope
and
examining
its
contents
carefully
first
a
letter
of
instructions
to
his
excellency
von
stromberg
signed
in
the
bold
hand
of
the
emperor
of
germany
himself
he
showed
her
the
signature
and
explained
its
contents
and
all
thought
of
weariness
went
from
her
mind
it
is
it
s
what
you
came
for
yes
he
replied
smiling
grimly
i
ve
got
is
it
it
isn
t
so
important
that
you
can
t
tell
me
she
asked
timidly
he
laughed
put
his
arm
around
her
and
held
her
for
a
moment
tenderly
she
had
endured
where
a
man
might
have
flinched
and
yet
at
this
moment
she
was
all
woman
timid
weary
unto
death
but
still
curious
it
was
the
master
impulse
no
he
smiled
you
ve
jolly
well
earned
the
right
to
know
i
ll
tell
he
was
so
big
so
strong
so
certain
of
himself
that
she
wondered
how
for
a
moment
even
she
could
have
thought
him
other
than
he
was
with
a
sudden
impulse
of
pride
and
tenderness
she
rose
put
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
bending
his
head
down
to
hers
kissed
him
upon
the
lips
he
caught
her
to
him
and
held
her
in
his
arms
o
cyril
she
murmured
that
i
could
ever
have
failed
in
my
belief
in
you
that
i
could
ever
have
thought
that
you
were
false
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
the
truth
i
would
have
kept
your
it
was
impossible
dear
it
was
too
big
a
thing
and
i
was
sworn
to
silence
but
since
you
found
out
did
you
think
me
curious
she
asked
naÃ¯vely
because
i
read
the
cigarette
papers
curious
he
laughed
well
rather
the
mistake
i
made
was
in
tellin
you
to
read
them
if
i
don
t
laugh
at
me
she
whispered
i
can
t
stand
that
the
only
retribution
for
what
i
did
this
afternoon
is
a
blow
if
you
struck
me
cyril
i
should
not
but
i
won
t
you
know
old
girl
but
i
m
going
to
kiss
you
again
if
you
don
t
and
he
did
while
a
shadow
darkened
her
eyes
it
seems
terrible
to
be
happy
even
in
our
moment
of
security
with
the
shadow
of
death
hanging
so
closely
over
us
i
know
you
had
to
kill
him
cyril
but
she
paused
it
was
either
that
or
he
would
have
killed
as
it
was
it
was
too
jolly
close
a
thing
for
comfort
i
gave
the
other
man
his
chance
but
he
wouldn
t
take
it
lucky
he
didn
t
for
i
might
have
missed
the
she
clung
to
him
more
closely
and
if
you
had
been
killed
she
whispered
i
saw
it
all
at
first
i
thought
you
had
fallen
o
cyril
the
agony
of
it
and
then
you
came
out
from
behind
the
tree
and
i
knew
that
you
were
unharmed
i
had
seen
a
man
die
as
i
had
there
upon
the
rocks
at
but
when
the
other
one
came
at
you
i
wanted
you
to
kill
him
i
it
i
prayed
that
you
would
it
was
murder
in
my
heart
i
can
t
understand
how
i
have
changed
and
i
ve
always
thought
death
such
a
fearsome
thing
she
hid
her
face
in
his
shoulder
and
clung
to
him
trembling
she
had
passed
through
danger
valiantly
carelessly
even
but
now
that
for
the
moment
danger
had
passed
she
yielded
to
the
reaction
he
kissed
her
gently
sh
child
don
t
let
it
work
on
you
no
bally
use
we
re
safe
yes
safe
for
the
present
that
ought
to
be
enough
for
me
but
if
anything
had
happened
to
you
she
shuddered
but
it
didn
t
oh
i
m
thankful
she
whispered
thankful
for
that
and
for
you
the
trouble
i
ve
passed
through
the
pain
of
my
thoughts
of
you
i
m
thankful
for
those
too
because
without
them
i
never
should
have
known
you
the
real
cyril
i
sometimes
think
that
life
deals
too
easily
with
most
of
us
to
bring
out
the
best
that
s
in
us
i
never
would
have
known
you
in
england

he
smiled
at
her
i
m
the
same
chap
though
can
t
tell
what
a
fellow
will
do
when
he
has
but
you
didn
t
have
to
you
might
have
gone
to
france
and
sat
in
a
trench
instead
of
that
you
did
what
was
harder
let
them
distrust
you
hold
you
in
contempt
keeping
silent
and
cheerful
while
you
were
doing
such
splendid
things
for
she
paused
while
she
caressed
him
and
said
in
a
proud
whisper
the
honorable
cyril
honorable
he
smiled
you
d
hardly

von
stromberg
to
think

terrible
old
man
she
went
on
clinging
to
him
i
can
see
his
vulture
face
now
he
would
have
shot
you
tomorrow
but
we
fooled
him
what
poor
lindberg
she
questioned
him
and
he
told
her
of
the
devotion
of
his
old
friend
and
what
will
von
stromberg
do
to
lindberg
she
asked
anxiously

he
said
slowly

he
paused
and
looked
into
the
fire

said
thoughtfully

he
said
quickly
she
read
the
anxiety
in
his
voice
and
knew
that
he
was
thinking
of
her
and
in
that
moment
a
new
idea
of
her
duty
came
to
her

said
quickly
that

get

it
wasn

for
me

she
clung
to
his
arms
and
looked
up
into
his
face
as
her
duty
came
more
clearly
to
her
while
her
voice
trembled
with
earnestness

she
looked
up
into
his
face
and
saw
that
its
expression
had
not
changed
he
was
still
smiling
at
her
softly
while
she
felt
the
touch
of
his
fingers
gently
petting
her
oh
you
won
t
go
you
won
t
she
cried
and
then
without
further
warning
burst
into
a
passion
of
tears
don
t
doris
for
god
s
sake
he
whispered

lurch
pretty
sort
of
a
johnny

a
thing

twenty
englands
doris
he
whispered
kissing
her
tenderly
not
for
twenty
englands
i
wouldn
his
touch
soothed
her
and
she
grew
more
quiet
of
of
course
you
t
she
murmured
but
i
you
her
hands
met
around
his
neck
and
he
raised
her
chin
and
kissed
her
on
the
mouth
it
was
a
kiss
of
plighted
troth
of
tenderness
faith
and
the
exalted
passion
that
comes
with
tears
mated
he
whispered
yes
yes
she
murmured
faintly
they
did
not
move
for
a
long
moment
when
doris
slowly
disengaged
her
arms
from
around
his
neck
and
moved
slightly
away
her
hair
had
fallen
and
hung
in
golden
disorder
about
her
shoulders
she
put
up
her
arm
trying
to
catch
the
escaping
pins
and
then
she
smiled
at
him
dimpling
adorably
come
he
said
gently
you
must
get
to
bed
your
coat
is
nearly
dry
but
i
ll
cover
you
with
my
jacket
you
must
sleep
too

shammin

know

t
tell
what
may
happen
i
ll
try
she
murmured
obediently
while
he
led
her
to
the
couch
of
boughs
and
made
her
lie
on
it
but
as
he
knelt
beside
her
covering
her
with
his
jacket
she
caught
his
hands
and
would
not
relinquish
them
he
raised
hers
to
his
lips
and
kissed
them
again
and
again
small
muscular
hands
they
were
but
now
very
brown
and
dirty
are
you
comfortable
sorry
i
haven
t
a
she
was
silent
a
moment
and
then
straightened
and
asked
him
you
promised
to
tell
me
about
the
papers
won
t
you
he
laughed
not
now
it
must
be
nearly
yes
now
i
m
not
tired
now
i
will
sleep
afterwards
i
like
to
hear
your
voice
cyril
perhaps
it
will
soothe
me
to
are
you
sure
he
asked
doubtfully
and
she
nodded
he
saw
that
she
was
still
nervous
and
wakeful
and
sank
beside
her
couch
taking
her
hand
in
his
it
is
really
quite
interestin
he
began
slowly
three
years
ago
at
the
invitation
of
the
emperor
of
germany
when
europe
was
at
peace
and
there
was
no
cloud
upon
the
horizon
bigger
than
a
chap
s
hand
there
met
in
a
shootin
lodge
near
schÃ¶ndorf
not
ten
miles
from
here
six
men
it
was
a
secret
conference
arranged
by
the
emperor
of
germany
through
his
excellency
graf
von
stromberg
the
six
men
were
his
highness
prince
von
waldheim
at
one
time
germany
s
ambassador
to
france
admiral
von
frankenhausen
head
and
front
of
the
imperial
german
navy
general
von
sandersdorf
the
brains
of
the
german
general
staff
his
excellency
moritz
von
komarom
minister
of
war
of
the
austrian
empire
viscount
melborne
english
secretary
of
state
for
foreign
affairs
and
of
the
british
she
was
listening
avidly
the
array
of
names
telling
her
as
nothing
else
could
have
done
the
importance
of
the
conference
this
meetin
was
a
secret
he
went
on
these
men
all
traveled
incognito
without
servants
and
were
met
by
an
agent
of
general
von
stromberg
at
schÃ¶ndorf
and
conducted
in
automobiles
to
the
huntin
lodge
i
have
spoken
of
these
men
remained
there
for
two
days
and
two
nights
and
then
went
home
but
while
they
were
there
they
were
makin
new
history
for
he
paused
to
fill
his
pipe
but
her
curiosity
could
not
be
restrained
and
what
were
they
doing
there
cyril
i
can
t
hammersley
got
up
and
held
his
pipe
to
the
candle
for
matches
were
scarce
and
then
with
maddening
calmness
sat
beside
her
again
that
secret
meetin
of
these
chaps
had
to
do
with
nothin
less
than
the
ruin
of
france
france
she
cried
england
had
nothing
against
france
and
now
she
is
her
three
years
ago
the
political
conditions
were
different
he
answered
those
representatives
of
england
came
and
sat
with
representatives
of
germany
and
austria
while
they
plotted
the
destruction
of
but
how
do
you
know
this
cyril
i
can
t
no
more
do
i
but
it
s
a
fact
let
me
go
on
at
the
table
in
the
lodge
where
this
conference
was
held
viscount
melborne
made
notes
of
what
was
goin
on
includin
the
combinations
of
land
and
naval
forces
that
could
be
made
against
france
and
russia
and
the
plans
to
break
the
russian
federation
in
the
balkans
when
the
meetin
was
over
all
the
scraps
of
paper
these
chaps
had
scribbled
on
were
destroyed
by
fire
before
the
eyes
of
the
men
who
had
made
em
except
those
of
viscount
melborne
who
put
em
in
his
pocket
and
with
them
a
pencil
copy
of
this
secret
treaty
in
his
own
handwriting
the
original
copy
of
the
treaty
was
entrusted
to
who
put
it
in
his
it
was
not
until
the
next
day
when
the
englishmen
in
the
train
on
the
way
to
paris
discovered
that
viscount
melborne
s
private
papers
were
missin
jolly
fine
mess
what
they
got
off
at
the
next
stop
went
back
to
schÃ¶ndorf
and
looked
for
the
papers
but
neither
there
nor
at
the
lodge
was
there
hair
or
hide
of
em
so
they
went
back
to
england
hopin
that
by
some
fortunate
accident
the
papers
had
been
and
these
asked
the
girl
are
they
he
nodded
to
make
the
story
short
i
found
out
where
they
had
gone
my
flights
to
germany
have
been
made
for
this
purpose
don
t
you
see
the
papers
came
into
the
hands
of
the
emperor
of
germany
and
he
was
plannin
to
have
em
sent
to
the
president
of
the
french
republic
england
s
ally
it
wouldn
t
do
you
know
to
have
such
papers
at
such
a
time
fall
into
the
hands
of
france
hardly
a
credit
to
english
diplomacy
what
might
even
result
in
a
new
but
where
were
the
papers
in
the
meanwhile
she
asked
that
is
what
took
me
so
bally
long
to
find
out
after
many
hunts
away
from
windenberg
at
night
i
traced
em
to
a
socialist
by
the
name
of
gottschalk
at
schÃ¶ndorf
who
had
received
em
from
a
pensioner
of
the
imperial
forest
service
one
of
the
attendants
at
the
huntin
lodge
where
the
conference
was
held
whether
he
found
em
or
stole
em
i
don
t
know
but
i
frightened
him
and
he
confessed
i
was
on
the
very
point
of
stealing
em
from
gottschalk
when
i
found
out
that
he
had
been
writin
to
the
wilhelmstrasse
and
when
i
tried
to
get
em
they
were
gone
if
i
d
got
em
then
you
would
not
be
here
doris
and
i
but
how
did
you
learn
what
the
wilhelmstrasse
proposed
to
do
with
them
oh
that
was
quite
clear
the
english
foreign
office
has
been
badly
frightened
and
has
used
every
effort
with
its
secret
agents
in
berlin
to
get
that
information
it
reached
london
the
other
day
and
just
before
i
left
scotland
i
knew
the
job
was
to
be
given
to
general
von
stromberg
the
rest
was
kismet
the
fortune
of
war
a
jolly
good
piece
of
luck
lindberg
overheard
through
the
microphone
von
stromberg
givin
instructions
to
wentz
so
that
his
excellency
s
own
weapons
were
turned
against
him
i
was
goin
to
waylay
wentz
on
the
way
to
france
but
circumstances
prevented
it
was
i
cyril
she
broke
in
pleadingly
i
didn
t
know
i
betrayed
a
trick
he
laughed
invented
in
the
rameses
family
but
still
he
frightened
me
she
stammered
i
believed
the
message
signed
maxwell
not
maxwell
he
said
gravely
for
maxwell
a
sore
spot
since
the
war
began
in
the
side
of
the
war
office
maxwell
is
you
she
exclaimed
fearfully
yes
he
replied
i
told
and
they
caught
him
i
couldn
t
do
so
before
it
s
war
doris
it
is
a
fair
game
i
ask
no
favors
nor
do
i
give
she
was
silent
a
moment
looking
into
the
fire
yes
i
understand
a
terrible
game
with
odds
against
and
then
after
a
pause
you
say
that
we
will
get
away
won
t
you
tell
me
your
plan
he
rose
with
a
confident
laugh
yes
i
have
a
plan
but
i
m
not
going
to
tell
it
now
you
are
going
to
she
laughed
wearily
and
sat
up
and
you
where
will
you
sleep
by
the
fire
i
ve
got
some
thinkin
to
do
i
m
not
sleepy
i
had
eight
hours
last
night
i
m
going
to
he
bent
over
her
and
gently
made
her
lie
down
i
will
talk
to
you
no
more
you
must
go
to
she
sighed
and
stretched
herself
out
while
he
covered
her
with
his
coat
then
he
put
a
fresh
log
on
the
fire
and
sat
beside
her
again
in
a
moment
he
heard
her
voice
i
hope
you
don
t
mind
my
telling
you
cyril
that
i
love
you
a
great
not
in
the
least
he
whispered
i
wouldn
t
mind
listenin
while
you
said
it
all
night
but
there
you
re
going
to
insist
on
my
sleeping
again
won
t
you
i
don
t
seem
to
feel
as
if
i
could
ever
sleep
again
you
re
so
cool
so
calm
cyril
how
you
be
no
bally
use
gettin
excited
here
we
are
snug
as
two
bugs
in
a
rug
we
ll
slip
through
them
some
but
where
will
we
go
he
smiled
i
have
a
notion
of
goin
to
his
kind
of
quiet
humor
always
put
her
on
her
mettle
to
england
she
started
up
there
won
t
be
much
chance
of
your
doin
anythin
tomorrow
if
you
don
t
get
your
sleep
he
insisted
gently
do
what
i
ask
doris
sleep
you
i
ll
try
good
night
good
he
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
and
drew
his
jacket
over
her
again
then
sat
beside
her
her
hand
in
his
watching
gradually
her
nerves
grew
quiet
and
weariness
mastered
her
he
waited
until
her
breathing
indicated
sleep
when
he
carefully
relinquished
her
hand
and
moved
to
the
fire
where
he
carefully
studied
the
papers
by
the
light
of
his
candle
after
which
he
slipped
them
into
the
pocket
of
his
trousers
and
moved
softly
across
the
cave
into
a
corner
where
he
opened
the
lid
of
a
tin
box
and
examined
its
contents
taking
out
a
fresh
candle
to
replace
the
other
one
which
was
on
the
point
of
expiring
then
he
filled
his
pipe
with
great
deliberateness
and
returning
to
the
stool
by
the
fire
crossed
his
knees
and
bent
forward
gazing
into
the
blaze
his
brows
tangled
in
deep
thought
he
had
succeeded
in
getting
what
he
came
for
so
far
the
secret
of
the
meeting
in
the
shooting
lodge
was
safe
but
for
how
long
by
this
time
a
description
of
the
two
of
them
had
of
course
been
telegraphed
to
every
village
and
military
station
in
germany
that
wouldn
t
do
at
all
alone
it
might
be
managed
with
a
german
officer
s
uniform
and
herr
lieutenant
orstmann
s
military
orders
but
with
doris
it
wasn
t
to
be
thought
of
the
other
alternative
appealed
to
him
more
strongly
he
had
matched
his
wits
against
von
stromberg
s
so
far
and
had
won
and
success
made
him
hopeful
where
carefulness
failed
audacity
sometimes
succeeded
the
more
he
thought
of
his
plan
the
deeper
became
his
conviction
that
it
was
the
only
one
possible
under
the
circumstances
there
was
continued
danger
for
the
papers
and
he
deliberated
for
a
long
while
upon
the
wisdom
of
destroying
them
at
once
finally
rejecting
that
idea
except
as
a
last
alternative
his
word
that
he
had
destroyed
them
would
perhaps
be
sufficient
to
ease
the
minds
of
the
gentlemen
at
the
foreign
office
but
there
were
certain
memoranda
about
the
promises
of
germany
to
england
signed
with
the
initials
of
prince
von
waldheim
which
should
at
all
costs
be
saved
but
aside
from
this
consideration
hammersley
having
carried
his
affairs
thus
far
successfully
had
a
pride
in
finishing
it
as
he
had
planned
it
could
be
done
he
would
do
it
he
got
up
and
put
another
log
on
the
fire
and
then
stretched
himself
out
at
full
length
upon
the
rocks
gazing
into
the
flame
in
the
corner
where
the
bed
was
he
heard
the
steady
breathing
of
the
girl
what
a
trump
she
was
what
a
tr
he
nodded
and
then
dozed
troubled
visions
flitted
across
his
mind
once
he
thought
he
heard
the
sound
of
a
footstep
on
the
rocks
and
started
up
it
was
broad
daylight
he
listened
for
a
while
and
then
slowly
sank
back
and
slept
again
how
long
he
did
not
know
for
something
awakened
him
and
he
sat
up
reaching
instinctively
for
the
holster
lying
at
his
side
to
look
straight
into
the
muzzle
of
an
automatic
behind
which
was
the
handsome
blond
head
of
udo
von
winden
chapter
xx
the
fight
in
the
cavern
udo
loomed
against
the
light
and
the
uniform
he
wore
seemed
to
give
the
projecting
weapon
a
new
significance
he
was
not
udo
the
kinsman
and
companion
who
had
so
often
shared
this
refuge
with
hammersley
in
the
hunting
days
he
was
germany
hammersley
could
never
remember
the
time
when
the
muzzle
of
a
weapon
had
seemed
so
large
it
was
much
better
to
sit
without
moving
and
udo
s
quick
instructions
were
not
wasted
don
t
move
cyril
he
said
coolly
in
german
up
with
your
hands
so
now
get
up
leaving
your
belt
where
it
is
and
sit
on
the
stool
yonder
quickly
i
will
shoot
to
hammersley
read
in
his
expression
a
determination
to
put
the
threat
into
practice
and
watching
narrowly
silently
obeyed
von
winden
still
covering
him
carefully
picked
up
the
belt
and
transferred
lindberg
s
pistol
to
his
own
holster
he
was
a
dead
shot
with
any
firearm
as
hammersley
knew
and
his
own
chances
at
three
paces
even
in
a
rush
were
small
it
was
decidedly
a
case
for
discretion
i
suppose
there
s
nothing
to
be
said
hammersley
muttered
you
outguessed
me
and
then
to
gain
a
moment
of
time
i
thought
that
your
memory
might
be
quite
good
enough
to
forget
the
von
winden
frowned
down
the
barrel
of
the
automatic
it
is
too
much
to
expect
even
from
me
he
said
crisply
i
am
your
kinsman
but
i
am
first
of
all
a
german
and
not
even
for
you
will
i
be
a
smiled
cyril
udo
von
winden
s
look
was
grave
his
voice
sober
and
the
muzzle
of
his
automatic
did
not
waver
i
have
already
had
a
bad
memory
my
cousin
this
afternoon
i
forgot
that
lindberg
who
served
your
meals
was
a
good
friend
of
yours
and
mine
and
that
he
might
be
counted
on
to
help
you
out
of
your
difficulties
i
also
forgot
that
there
was
such
a
place
as
the
cave
of
the
thorwald
until
i
learned
from
excellenz
last
night
the
price
germany
was
to
pay
for
my
indifference
if
you
had
failed
to
capture
the
documents
of
his
majesty
i
might
have
remained
silent
as
you
took
them
there
remained
nothing
but
to
act
i
came
here
for
i
knew
it
would
be
the
one
place
where
i
should
find
hammersley
bent
his
head
i
and
then
quickly
would
you
mind
telling
me
if
you
have
spoken
if
you
have
told
what
lindberg
no
von
winden
broke
in
i
have
told
nothing
lindberg
is
safe
i
have
come
here
alone
hammersley
gave
a
gasp
of
relief
and
leaned
forward
peering
into
the
fire
i
came
for
one
purpose
cyril
udo
went
on
quietly
i
have
no
personal
desire
for
your
death
but
i
would
kill
you
as
you
sit
rather
than
see
germany
suffer
the
loss
of
the
documents
in
your
possession
i
came
for
them
and
i
intend
that
you
shall
give
them
to
hammersley
looked
up
into
his
cousin
s
face
and
their
eyes
met
von
winden
s
tone
was
cool
and
his
manner
as
calm
as
on
the
days
last
year
when
they
were
hunting
together
but
hammersley
knew
that
when
udo
von
winden
was
most
calm
he
was
also
most
dangerous
so
he
slowly
reached
into
the
pocket
of
his
trousers
and
handed
his
cousin
the
papers
he
had
taken
from
the
german
messenger
said
udo
backing
to
the
light
of
the
entrance
of
the
cave
to
examine
them
you
are
sure
they
are
all
here
my
word
on
it
udo
said
hammersley
frankly
he
watched
his
cousin
examine
the
documents
and
heard
him
give
an
exclamation
of
satisfaction
but
hammersley
saw
that
his
eyes
neglected
no
detail
of
the
cavern
and
was
aware
that
the
muzzle
of
the
weapon
in
udo
s
hand
still
bore
directly
upon
him
in
the
shadows
hammersley
saw
the
face
of
doris
who
was
sitting
up
pallid
and
as
though
awakened
from
one
nightmare
into
another
as
udo
saw
her
the
muzzle
of
his
weapon
wavered
and
went
out
of
alignment
but
hammersley
did
not
move
or
even
appear
to
notice
the
girl
there
was
a
note
of
embarrassment
in
the
german
s
officer
s
voice
as
he
spoke
again
i
am
sorry
my
cousin
that
your
father
s
blood
called
you
to
be
false
to
germany
you
had
been
suspected
by
excellenz
but
i
would
have
sworn
that
he
was
mistaken
you
owe
me
nothing
of
course
but
it
s
war
udo
said
hammersley
quietly
you
will
remember
that
i
did
not
seek
duty
in
the
imperial
secret
service
it
was
the
herr
general
who
thought
it
valuable
to
use
our
kinship
for
his
own
udo
shrugged
yes
i
know
he
said
quietly
you
have
done
your
duty
but
you
must
now
be
aware
of
the
fact
that
you
can
ask
no
favors
of
i
don
t
i
am
in
your
power
shoot
me
if
you
udo
smiled
i
can
hardly
be
expected
to
do
that
i
do
not
love
you
now
my
cousin
i
can
not
love
anyone
who
is
false
to
my
country
but
i
can
not
forget
that
once
not
a
year
ago
we
were
brothers
no
i
can
not
shoot
you
cyril
though
perhaps
that
would
be
a
better
death
than
that
other
hammersley
shrugged
it
is
the
fortune
of
war
from
your
point
of
view
i
deserve
it
i
can
only
thank
you
again
for
myself
and
for
miss
mather
for
your
a
sound
from
the
girl
and
udo
acknowledged
her
presence
by
a
bow
under
other
circumstances
he
said
with
stiff
politeness
i
should
be
glad
to
extend
the
hospitalities
of
winden
schloss
but
of
course
as
miss
mather
can
see
my
mother
and
sisters
are
away
and
i
of
course
graf
von
winden
it
is
understood
she
said
haltingly
in
german
i
can
do
nothing
frÃ¤ulein
i
am
powerless
at
the
orders
of
general
von
stromberg
who
arranges
the
coming
and
the
going
of
all
at
the
coming
udo
said
hammersley
dryly
not
the
i
am
sorry
i
have
done
what
i
could
you
have
done
well
to
give
me
the
papers
i
shall
now
go
back
to
blaufelden
and
return
them
to
hammersley
started
up
you
mean
that
you
will
leave
us
here
i
do
not
wish
to
see
you
killed
against
the
kitchen
wall
it
is
not
the
death
for
the
blood
of
von
eppingen
even
if
you
are
shot
while
escaping
it
would
be
he
shrugged
my
position
is
this
you
can
do
germany
no
further
harm
i
shall
tell
a
likely
story
i
have
the
papers
they
are
what
i
came
for
if
you
had
not
given
them
to
me
i
would
have
killed
you
but
now
i
shall
go
away
alone
as
i
good
old
udo
said
hammersley
impulsively
taking
a
pace
toward
him
his
hand
outstretched
but
von
winden
s
automatic
came
quickly
into
line
and
hammersley
halted
one
moment
my
cousin
said
von
winden
coolly
i
am
quite
willing
to
accept
your
expressions
of
gratitude
from
a
distance
i
may
not
wish
to
see
you
killed
by
others
and
i
would
regret
the
necessity
of
killing
you
myself
i
shall
consider
you
my
prisoner
until
i
go
after
that
and
he
shrugged
expressively
you
can
go
where
you
hammersley
folded
his
arms
and
frowned
where
i
like
he
muttered
with
every
village
in
on
the
lookout
for
there
was
a
pause
after
which
von
winden
spoke
with
quiet
earnestness
unfortunately
i
may
not
help
you
further
since
there
is
food
to
wait
here
is
safer
alone
traveling
by
night
a
man
might
reach
basel
safely
as
for
the
frÃ¤ulein
if
she
will
return
to
blaufelden
and
give
herself
up
imprisonment
for
a
time
is
perhaps
the
worst
that
she
need
doris
had
risen
the
white
light
from
the
door
of
the
cavern
searching
her
face
pitilessly
it
is
what
i
would
do
she
said
haltingly
what
i
have
pleaded
with
him
to
let
me
do
cyril
she
implored
in
english
you
must
let
i
will
think
about
it
he
muttered
you
are
sure
that
no
harm
will
come
to
her
the
muzzle
of
the
automatic
had
wavered
out
of
line
again
and
hammersley
was
carefully
measuring
with
his
eye
the
distance
that
separated
him
from
his
cousin
the
bark
of
excellenz
is
much
worse
than
his
bite
he
will
bluster
and
storm
but
eventually
he
will
return
miss
mather
to
her
own
hammersley
was
shaking
his
head
in
indecision
i
am
not
so
sure
that
i
agree
with
you
about
the
bite
of
excellenz
i
shall
think
of
what
i
will
do
i
m
sure
of
one
thing
udo
he
said
with
sincerity
that
i
am
deeply
grateful
for
what
you
have
done
the
war
has
made
us
enemies
and
you
have
now
prevented
the
success
of
my
great
venture
but
i
bear
you
no
illwill
the
debt
is
still
mine
on
account
of
your
silence
back
there
a
debt
made
deeper
by
the
presence
of
frÃ¤ulein
he
paused
to
give
his
words
effect
i
had
not
told
you
udo
for
at
windenberg
one
has
no
time
to
think
of
the
gentler
things
of
life
but
just
before
the
war
broke
out
frÃ¤ulein
mather
had
promised
me
to
become
my
hammersley
watched
von
winden
as
he
turned
toward
doris
with
a
smile
bowing
deeply
his
sense
of
the
situation
lost
for
a
second
in
the
obligations
of
civility
as
he
murmured
a
phrase
of
congratulations
i
am
much
honored
by
your
confidences
he
said
formally
and
i
deeply
regret
he
got
no
further
for
hammersley
had
sprung
in
suddenly
toward
him
risking
udo
s
shot
which
was
fired
quickly
without
aim
a
furious
struggle
followed
hammersley
caught
at
von
winden
s
wrist
and
his
weight
bore
him
back
against
the
rock
while
both
of
them
fought
for
the
possession
of
the
weapon
the
german
officer
was
smaller
than
his
cousin
but
his
wrists
were
good
and
he
was
quicker
than
hammersley
they
bore
only
friendship
for
each
other
but
the
incentive
of
each
was
greater
even
than
hatred
could
have
been
they
struggled
in
silence
the
thought
of
the
possession
of
the
papers
uppermost
in
the
minds
of
both
the
struggle
was
not
that
of
kinsman
against
kinsman
but
of
england
against
germany
realizing
the
desperateness
of
hammersley
s
attack
and
the
purpose
of
it
von
winden
knew
that
a
victory
for
hammersley
meant
the
loss
of
the
papers
and
so
he
was
bent
on
killing
his
cousin
if
he
could
hammersley
on
preventing
him
from
doing
so
they
swayed
from
side
to
side
breathing
hard
while
doris
crouched
against
the
side
of
the
cavern
dumb
with
terror
twice
she
saw
the
weapon
in
the
german
officer
s
hand
point
downward
toward
cyril
s
back
and
then
before
it
could
be
used
saw
cyril
s
arm
quickly
push
it
upward
she
knew
that
she
was
in
danger
but
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
at
one
moment
von
winden
seemed
to
have
the
advantage
and
in
another
cyril
udo
s
back
was
against
the
wall
and
one
of
cyril
s
arms
was
around
him
while
their
legs
were
intertwined
as
each
tried
to
get
the
other
off
his
balance
suddenly
with
an
effort
hammersley
managed
to
wrench
the
pistol
from
von
winden
s
hand
and
he
tossed
it
into
the
corner
of
the
cavern
von
winden
had
every
ethical
right
to
kill
hammersley
if
he
could
but
after
what
his
cousin
had
done
for
him
hammersley
could
not
kill
udo
that
was
impossible
he
must
succeed
without
that
this
generosity
nearly
proved
fatal
to
him
for
the
german
managed
to
reach
hammersley
s
automatic
in
his
own
holster
and
had
almost
disengaged
it
when
hammersley
caught
his
hand
again
and
the
struggle
was
renewed
but
doris
whose
senses
and
initiative
had
slowly
returned
to
her
now
crept
around
the
walls
of
the
cave
and
when
von
winden
s
outstretched
hand
came
within
her
reach
she
seized
his
forearm
in
both
of
her
hands
and
clung
to
it
desperately
keeping
the
muzzle
pointed
away
from
cyril
she
was
swayed
to
and
fro
with
the
struggling
men
who
finally
toppled
sideways
and
fell
to
the
floor
dragging
her
with
them
but
von
winden
s
grasp
of
the
weapon
never
quite
secure
was
loosened
and
as
they
dropped
it
went
flying
under
the
table
the
fight
was
soon
out
of
the
german
for
hammersley
s
weight
had
fallen
on
him
heavily
and
in
a
moment
the
officer
was
flat
on
his
back
and
hammersley
was
sitting
on
him
doris
who
had
meanwhile
picked
up
the
pistol
now
heard
hammersley
gasping
jerkily
quick
doris
something
to
tie
with
your
she
understood
and
disappeared
outside
the
cavern
returning
presently
with
the
bonds
helping
cyril
while
he
made
the
wrists
and
ankles
of
von
winden
fast
i
might
have
killed
you
but
i
didn
t
hammersley
was
gasping
you
saw
that
udo
didn
t
you
you
needn
t
make
apologies
i
would
have
killed
you
i
tried
to
it
s
too
bad
too
bad
he
panted
i
m
sorry
hammersley
repeated
those
papers
they
re
england
s
udo
they
re
my
property
i
ve
got
to
take
and
without
further
words
he
put
his
hand
inside
the
breast
of
the
officer
s
coat
and
took
the
papers
out
i
wish
it
were
anybody
but
you
he
said
i
don
t
think
you
can
get
away
with
i
m
going
to
i
ll
prevent
you
if
i
how
i
ll
show
and
with
the
remnants
of
his
breath
he
shouted
lustily
for
help
hammersley
threw
him
back
none
too
gently
and
clapped
a
handkerchief
in
his
mouth
while
he
directed
doris
to
tear
her
and
make
bandages
for
a
gag
they
worked
quickly
and
in
a
moment
the
german
officer
was
silent
and
helpless
then
for
a
long
moment
hammersley
sat
by
the
prostrate
man
slowly
recovering
his
breath
doris
with
fear
crouched
beside
him
obedient
to
his
look
and
action
at
last
with
a
laugh
he
got
up
close
thing
that
he
said
my
word
he
nearly
got
and
then
with
a
look
at
the
prostrate
man
poor
old
udo
in
a
moment
with
a
word
to
doris
he
went
outside
the
cave
and
listened
intently
he
peered
cautiously
over
the
ridge
of
rocks
the
road
was
deserted
the
sound
of
the
shot
while
it
had
seemed
deafening
would
have
been
muffled
at
the
entrance
of
the
cavern
and
could
not
have
been
heard
from
a
distance
and
when
hammersley
returned
he
reassured
doris
as
to
the
immediate
danger
of
discovery
there
is
no
hurry
doris
i
must
think
he
said
filling
his
pipe
he
stood
upright
for
a
while
puffing
rapidly
peering
down
at
the
captive
his
expression
struggling
between
a
frown
and
a
smile
herr
graf
udo
von
winden
looked
so
very
much
like
a
mummy
the
eyes
of
his
cousin
the
only
visible
part
of
his
face
followed
hammersley
intently
i
could
have
done
for
you
udo
hammersley
repeated
i
want
to
be
sure
that
you
understand
von
winden
s
head
moved
ever
so
slightly
doris
had
sunk
upon
the
stool
her
face
buried
in
her
hands
oh
it
s
cruel
she
murmured
let
him
go
hardly
said
hammersley
coolly
he
d
raise
a
rumpus
wouldn
t
you
udo
the
officer
s
head
did
not
move
you
see
said
hammersley
but
i
m
going
to
make
him
as
comfortable
as
and
taking
him
by
the
armpits
he
dragged
his
cousin
over
to
the
corner
and
laid
him
gently
on
the
bed
of
balsam
and
then
stood
beside
the
bed
looking
down
at
him
thoughtfully
addressing
him
impersonally
in
english
as
though
thinking
aloud
what
s
to
become
of
you
when
we
go
old
chap
that
s
what
s
bothering
me
the
german
s
shoulders
moved
slightly
oh
that
s
all
very
well
but
i
can
t
leave
you
up
here
to
rot
my
cousin
no
one
knows
the
way
to
the
crag
of
the
thorwald
you
might
be
here
a
thousand
years
if
lindberg
shouldn
t
von
winden
made
no
sign
it
was
obvious
that
he
had
no
further
intention
of
helping
in
the
solution
of
the
difficulty
let
me
stay
here
with
him
cyril
doris
was
pleading
again
it
can
do
me
no
harm
and
when
you
are
well
on
your
way
i
will
release
him
and
go
back
to
i
can
t
take
that
chance
you
re
going
with
where
to
but
how
leave
that
to
me
at
present
we
must
have
breakfast
do
you
know
it
s
almost
ten
o
clock
bewildered
she
watched
him
go
to
the
large
tin
box
in
the
corner
of
the
cavern
from
which
he
brought
forth
some
dry
salt
biscuit
and
several
pieces
of
chocolate
it
isn
t
much
but
it
s
the
best
i
can
do
there
s
tea
too
but
i
don
t
dare
light
the
she
ate
slowly
at
first
for
the
food
seemed
to
choke
her
but
she
recalled
the
fact
that
except
for
two
pieces
of
toast
and
the
chocolate
of
von
stromberg
she
had
eaten
nothing
since
yesterday
morning
cyril
who
never
seemed
at
a
loss
for
anything
produced
a
metal
pitcher
and
going
outside
the
cave
for
a
moment
returned
with
it
full
of
water
lindberg
s
he
said
in
reply
to
her
question
his
food
too
good
old
he
frowned
and
then
went
over
to
the
prisoner
you
needn
t
tell
me
if
you
don
t
care
to
udo
but
i
d
like
to
know
how
lindberg
is
will
you
answer
me
von
winden
nodded
he
is
able
to
be
about
he
nodded
again
did
his
excellency
suspect
he
shook
his
head
thank
god
then
lindberg
is
at
liberty
udo
replied
in
the
affirmative
hammersley
gave
a
gasp
of
relief
that
is
well
i
need
not
worry
he
will
come
and
release
von
winden
only
frowned
listen
udo
went
on
hammersley
quickly
frÃ¤ulein
mather
and
i
are
going
down
from
here
leaving
you
alone
it
can
t
be
helped
you
ve
stumbled
up
here
and
you
ve
got
to
take
your
chance
in
time
you
may
wear
the
strings
through
against
a
rock
if
you
don
t
return
to
blaufelden
by
tomorrow
lindberg
will
find
but
suppose
anything
happened
to
lindberg
doris
was
whispering
ah
cyril
it
would
be
terrible
to
leave
him
here
i
should
dream
of
it
every
night
of
my
udo
s
eyes
smiled
at
her
there
is
little
danger
graf
von

is
not
a
man
to
be
so
easily
beaten
he
will
get
away
by
tonight
but
in
the
meanwhile
we
will
have
gone
far
enough
to
be
out
of

going
to
england
child
in
the
yellow
dove
he
laughed
doris
started
away
from
him
her
eyes
suddenly
brilliant
with
excitement
and
the
prisoner
who
had
lain
without
movement
showed
sudden
signs
of
activity
his
eyes
frowning
and
his
head
wagging
in
anxiety
he
wants
to
speak
said
doris
hammersley
bent
over
his
cousin
will
you
promise
not
to
shout
von
winden
nodded
quickly
so
hammersley
untied
the
bandages
that
held
the
handkerchief
in
the
prisoner
s
mouth
and
helped
him
to
a
sitting
posture
you
must
not
go
he
stammered
quickly
in
german
it
is
impossible
you
will
fail
i
warn
why
do
you
think
so
the
machines
are
guarded
and
the
of
your
taube
have
been
removed
and
h
m
said
hammersley
thoughtfully
excellenz
neglects
you
would
go
to
your
perhaps
thanks
for
the
warning
said
hammersley
bluntly
i
m
going
just
the
von
winden
looked
at
him
in
amazement
you
do
not
believe
me
he
asked
it
is
the
truth
i
tell
i
shall
find
a
but
there
is
no
way
you
think
that
i
am
trying
to
persuade
you
to
escape
by
the
mountains
so
that
you
may
be
captured
with
the
papers
yes
i
could
not
escape
that
way
now
you
know
perhaps
not
but
what
you
plan
is
fortune
favors
the
fool
i
ve
made
up
my
then
you
deserve
to
be
shot
said
udo
in
the
forest
at
least
you
would
have
a
chance
he
gave
a
guttural
exclamation
and
then
bind
me
and
leave
me
then
quickly
it
s
udo
said
hammersley
with
a
smile
we
ll
meet
again
when
is
an
english
bah
cyril
said
von
winden
i
have
always
said
that
you
were
a
hammersley
replaced
the
gag
and
bound
it
into
place
with
great
care
smiling
the
while
then
he
removed
the
belt
which
contained
his
cousin
s
supply
of
cartridges
and
fastened
it
around
his
own
body
above
lindberg
s
loading
the
two
weapons
with
care
and
placing
them
in
their
holsters
doris
watched
these
preparations
anxiously
but
hammersley
made
her
eat
her
fill
of
chocolate
and
biscuits
and
when
they
had
finished
he
went
to
the
corner
of
the
cavern
and
brought
forth
a
large
and
heavy
parcel
which
he
put
on
the
table
and
opened
doris
saw
that
captain
von
winden
was
straightening
on
the
couch
trying
to
see
what
it
contained
hammersley
did
not
even
glance
in
his
direction
he
seemed
to
know
by
instinct
that
udo
s
curiosity
had
gotten
the
better
of
his
dignity
he
opened
the
package
deliberately
and
spread
the
contents
out
upon
the
table
spare
parts
of
the
taube
udo
i
ve
had
them
here
for
weeks
i
ll
let
you
have
a
peep
at
em
if
you
like
a
bolts
nuts
and
wire
by
jove
we
might
have
used
that
on
you
are
afraid
that
what
he
says
is
true
whispered
doris
anxiously
von
stromberg
is
prepared
for
i
wonder
he
said
chapter
xxi
hare
and
hounds
for
two
hours
or
more
hammersley
and
the
girl
taking
turn
and
turn
watched
the
road
and
forest
from
the
amphitheater
of
rocks
the
road
in
times
of
peace
was
a
short
route
from
windenberg
to
schÃ¶ndorf
and
popular
with
the
but
the
restrictions
put
upon
visits
to
blaufelden
had
resulted
in
the
diversion
of
traffic
from
the
south
slope
of
the
mountains
to
the
longer
road
in
the
valley
upon
the
other
side
the
few
who
appeared
were
men
in
uniform
from
his
lofty
perch
hammersley
espied
captain
wentz
as
he
hurried
by
with
several
men
in
an
automobile
just
beyond
the
crag
the
automobile
was
stopped
and
the
men
dismounted
and
went
on
afoot
clearly
they
meant
to
continue
the
search
abroad
hammersley
chuckled
hare
and
hounds
he
muttered
to
himself
the
more
men
to
the
eastward
the
fewer
to
the
west
by
jove
the
expletive
was
not
unusual
with
hammersley
but
the
manner
of
its
utterance
gave
it
importance
he
crossed
the
level
quickly
and
peered
again
at
the
vanishing
figures
of
the
men
a
new
idea
had
been
born
hare
and
hounds
a
game
he
had
played
at
eton
a
game
as
old
as
sport
as
old
as
hunting
and
for
such
a
prize
he
hurried
into
the
cave
glancing
hurriedly
at
his
watch
it
was
noon
doris
sat
upon
the
stool
near
udo
von
winden
hammersley
went
over
to
their
captive
and
examined
his
bonds
and
then
gave
the
girl
a
few
hasty
instructions
i
am
going
down
below
to
be
gone
two
perhaps
three
a
quick
intake
of
the
breath
escaped
her
but
she
caught
her
under
lip
in
her
teeth
and
said
nothing
don
t
worry
he
went
on
cheerfully
i
m
coming
back
i
ll
promise
you
that
i
ve
got
a
plan
he
whispered
a
new
plan
a
noble
plan
a
plan
that
will
make
our
game
an
easy
one
it
will
be
harder
for
you
than
for
me
doris
because
you
ve
only
got
to
sit
and
wait
and
try
to
be
while
he
was
talking
he
had
taken
off
the
belts
that
contained
the
two
pistols
fastening
one
around
doris
then
he
took
off
his
leather
jacket
and
put
it
on
the
table
fastening
the
other
belt
containing
udo
s
cartridges
and
automatic
over
his
gray
sweater
she
watched
him
timidly
but
suppose
graf
von
winden
should
get
his
arms
free
she
protested
i
can
not
shoot
him
cyril
i
can
not
not
that
he
won
t
trouble
you
i
ll
arrange
he
took
from
his
coat
pocket
the
documents
captured
from
the
emperor
s
messenger
and
held
them
up
so
that
udo
von
winden
could
see
them
i
must
leave
you
for
a
while
udo
awfully
sorry
but
it
s
most
he
laughed
you
won
t
mind
will
you
or
try
to
make
things
difficult
he
turned
quickly
and
while
both
the
girl
and
the
prisoner
wondered
what
he
was
about
to
do
he
went
to
the
tin
box
in
the
corner
brought
out
a
new
candle
lighted
it
and
held
the
papers
so
that
the
prisoner
could
see
them
do
you
observe
what
i
am
doing
udo
miss
mather
will
sit
here
upon
the
opposite
side
of
the
cave
if
you
attempt
to
get
up
from
your
bed
she
will
burn
the
papers
simple
isn
t
it
also
quite
effective
she
doesn
t
want
to
shoot
you
udo
nor
do
i
and
of
course
if
the
papers
were
burned
it
wouldn
t
hurt
england
a
great
deal
as
long
as
the
papers
are
in
germany
my
capture
may
throw
them
into
german
hands
udo
von
winden
s
head
moved
slightly
from
left
to
right
with
an
thrown
over
his
shoulder
at
udo
hammersley
went
outside
the
cave
where
doris
followed
him
she
was
on
the
point
of
tears
but
she
succeeded
in
a
smile
don
t
worry
doris
old
girl
just
going
down
for
a
stroll
but
why
cyril
goin
to
throw
em
off
the
scent
he
whispered
but
they
re
already
off
the
for
answer
he
kissed
her
gently
and
bade
her
keep
up
her
courage
then
he
gave
her
the
papers
saw
her
inside
the
cave
again
and
in
a
moment
was
gone
the
more
hammersley
thought
of
his
plan
the
better
it
seemed
to
him
the
day
was
still
young
in
three
hours
he
could
do
much
he
crossed
the
amphitheater
of
rocks
and
followed
the
rocky
gorge
by
which
he
had
entered
last
night
and
when
he
emerged
upon
the
farther
side
paused
and
watched
for
a
while
to
be
sure
that
wentz
and
his
men
were
not
in
sight
and
then
descended
the
face
of
the
rocks
skillfully
and
in
a
moment
was
creeping
on
all
fours
through
the
underbrush
up
the
side
of
the
mountain
it
was
steep
here
and
rugged
but
in
a
while
he
reached
the
old
deer
trail
over
which
he
had
passed
when
he
had
doubled
on
his
pursuers
last
night
but
instead
of
following
it
he
halted
a
moment
to
listen
and
then
crossed
into
the
undergrowth
which
at
this
point
was
so
thick
that
at
twenty
paces
even
he
was
not
visible
he
slipped
among
the
treetrunks
and
evergreens
moving
rapidly
making
a
wide
circle
up
the
mountainside
almost
to
its
top
descending
then
by
easy
stages
until
he
had
covered
four
miles
at
least
when
he
bore
slowly
down
toward
the
schÃ¶ndorf
road
hare
and
hounds
an
exciting
game
even
in
the
old
days
when
it
meant
athletic
honors
but
now
with
the
alternatives
of
death
as
the
penalty
of
capture
and
a
great
triumph
as
the
reward
of
escape
it
made
his
blood
run
madly
a
good
game
a
fair
game
with
success
as
the
reward
of
intelligence
he
planned
carefully
he
must
be
sure
to
come
down
into
the
open
at
a
spot
beyond
where
wentz
and
his
men
were
searching
he
knew
the
country
well
there
was
a
village
on
the
hillside
half
a
mile
below
it
was
midway
between
schÃ¶ndorf
and
the
farm
house
at
blaufelden
the
families
of
some
of
the
foresters
lived
there
and
there
was
telephonic
connection
both
with
the
farm
and
windenberg
all
of
the
men
of
mittelwald
who
were
not
in
the
forest
service
were
off
at
the
front
and
the
chances
were
that
unless
wentz
and
his
men
were
there
hammersley
would
see
only
women
and
children
but
he
knew
that
von
stromberg
had
neglected
nothing
that
would
give
an
inkling
of
his
whereabouts
and
his
presence
would
be
at
once
reported
and
the
chase
begin
he
was
in
excellent
condition
trained
a
little
too
fine
perhaps
for
an
englishman
but
fit
he
had
done
little
running
since
leaving
the
university
and
though
he
had
lost
some
of
his
old
speed
he
could
rely
upon
the
thought
of
his
danger
and
doris
s
to
provide
the
incentive
for
extraordinary
effort
mittelwald
lay
in
a
clearing
similar
to
that
at
blaufelden
and
its
farms
if
farms
they
could
be
called
clambered
up
the
hillside
and
straggled
over
beyond
the
road
where
they
were
merged
into
the
undergrowth
of
young
oaks
the
schÃ¶ndorf
road
curving
this
way
and
that
passed
between
the
houses
which
were
set
at
irregular
intervals
like
the
strips
on
the
tail
of
a
kite
he
went
on
through
the
underbrush
coming
out
into
the
open
upon
the
road
at
the
point
where
it
entered
the
woods
upon
the
schÃ¶ndorf
side
then
he
settled
his
automatic
loosely
in
its
sheath
and
went
forward
boldly
his
eye
had
marked
the
line
of
the
telephone
wire
and
followed
it
to
the
gable
of
one
of
the
largest
houses
in
the
village
it
was
to
this
house
that
he
made
his
way
a
young
woman
was
working
in
the
garden
and
he
approached
her
quietly
and
politely
but
with
an
air
of
a
man
not
to
be
trifled
with
asked
for
food
he
was
aware
that
he
was
unshorn
covered
with
mud
and
that
his
face
was
streaked
with
dirt
and
perspiration
but
he
knew
that
his
appearance
alone
could
not
have
accounted
for
the
sudden
blanching
of
the
woman
s
face
and
the
air
of
alarm
with
which
she
regarded
him
she
straightened
and
fell
back
two
or
three
paces
toward
the
house
unable
to
speak
a
word
in
reply
so
he
repeated
his
request
while
her
mouth
gaped
at
him
and
her
eyes
grew
rounder
at
last
she
managed
to
stammer
food
you
are
hungry
yes
potato
bread
anything
but
quickly
i
will
go
with
you
to
the
and
he
indicated
the
way
she
stumbled
on
before
him
her
head
jerking
anxiously
this
way
and
that
over
her
shoulder
as
though
she
feared
at
any
moment
to
receive
a
blow
or
a
shot
in
the
back
but
he
followed
her
indoors
and
noted
with
satisfaction
that
she
appeared
after
all
to
be
a
woman
of
some
intelligence
a
thing
that
pleased
him
further
was
the
telephone
instrument
in
the
corner
milk
if
you
please
and
quickly
i
will
take
the
bread
with
and
while
she
timorously
brought
them
out
who
lives
here
where
is
he
peremptorily
at
oh
there
are
no
men
here
that
is
well
he
drank
a
glass
of
milk
greedily
and
tore
off
a
piece
of
the
loaf
you
are
a
good
girl
heaven
will
reward
he
made
his
way
to
the
door
looking
out
cautiously
and
then
turned
and
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
bringing
out
a
piece
of
money
see
he
laughed
i
have
concluded
to
reward
you
myself
cash
much
better
than
hopes
she
fetched
a
timorous
smile
and
bobbed
shyly
you
will
do
me
a
favor
he
said
in
a
whisper
as
he
went
out
of
the
door
if
you
will
tell
no
one
of
my
and
with
that
chuckling
to
himself
went
down
the
road
again
in
the
direction
of
schÃ¶ndorf
watching
the
turn
in
the
road
below
the
village
for
a
glimpse
of
wentz
and
his
men
before
he
reached
the
edge
of
the
open
country
he
paused
and
listened
from
the
house
that
he
had
visited
came
the
faint
tinkle
of
a
bell
frau
habermehl
had
lost
no
time
she
had
notified
the
master
of
the
hounds
who
was
clamoring
for
the
scent
hammersley
walked
around
the
turn
in
the
road
which
hid
him
from
the
house
and
then
went
into
the
bushes
where
he
sat
on
a
fallen
log
peeping
through
the
leaves
toward
the
further
side
of
the
clearing
where
general
von
stromberg
s
men
must
appear
he
did
not
know
how
long
he
would
have
to
wait
half
an
hour
perhaps
longer
if
he
knew
anything
of
von
stromberg
they
would
come
in
every
sort
of
available
vehicle
from
a
machine
to
a
donkey
cart
picking
up
the
misguided
wentz
and
his
men
upon
the
way
to
follow
this
new
scent
it
was
difficult
to
sit
still
and
wait
hammersley
wanted
a
smoke
awfully
but
he
chewed
a
twig
instead
for
he
needed
to
keep
his
wind
in
good
condition
and
had
purposely
left
his
pipe
at
the
thorwald
he
did
not
want
to
get
too
far
away
from
doris
by
the
way
he
intended
to
return
he
was
now
at
least
six
miles
from
the
cavern
and
with
the
mile
or
so
he
must
go
toward
schÃ¶ndorf
before
he
turned
a
good
eight
miles
of
rough
going
lay
between
himself
and
safety
under
other
circumstances
he
would
have
greatly
enjoyed
the
chance
for
a
rest
with
a
cooler
wind
from
the
northeast
the
weather
had
cleared
and
the
period
of
higher
temperatures
through
which
they
had
passed
seemed
to
be
drawing
to
a
close
in
spite
of
the
doubts
that
hung
about
his
plan
he
couldn
t
help
saying
to
himself
that
he
felt
jolly
fit
twenty
minutes
he
got
up
and
stretched
his
long
limbs
luxuriously
the
hare
was
ready
it
was
time
they
cast
forward
the
hounds
a
peep
through
the
bushes
showed
him
frau
habermehl
standing
near
her
home
watching
the
road
to
windenberg
so
he
came
out
of
his
place
of
concealment
and
stood
in
the
open
again
until
he
was
sure
that
she
saw
him
when
he
turned
and
went
slowly
toward
schÃ¶ndorf
he
had
planned
his
moment
nicely
for
before
he
was
out
of
sight
of
the
clearing
an
automobile
came
into
view
paused
a
moment
before
frau
habermehl
and
then
came
on
rapidly
hammersley
waited
until
they
had
viewed
him
and
then
cut
into
the
woods
to
his
left
slipping
from
tree
to
tree
not
fifty
yards
in
the
cover
when
the
machine
came
to
a
stop
and
the
men
jumped
down
and
came
after
him
he
did
not
know
who
was
in
command
and
did
not
care
but
just
to
show
them
that
he
was
the
man
they
were
after
he
risked
a
shot
with
his
automatic
and
then
sped
along
rapidly
working
up
the
mountainside
following
in
a
general
way
the
direction
of
schÃ¶ndorf
he
heard
them
plunging
after
him
in
full
cry
and
the
sound
of
their
footsteps
made
him
move
at
a
rare
pace
he
knew
well
this
piece
of
woods
and
in
a
moment
came
to
a
path
which
curved
to
the
right
leading
straight
up
the
mountain
when
he
reached
it
he
paused
to
look
over
his
shoulder
it
was
difficult
to
see
the
green
uniforms
but
there
was
a
flash
of
light
from
a
patch
of
fir
trees
and
a
twig
just
above
his
head
fell
across
his
path
his
curiosity
was
satisfied
he
shut
his
mouth
and
breathing
through
his
nostrils
went
off
with
a
burst
of
speed
which
put
him
around
a
turn
in
the
path
before
any
of
the
green
uniforms
had
come
into
sight
he
had
them
coming
now
two
three
men
one
little
one
and
two
big
ones
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
them
in
a
moment
when
the
path
came
into
a
glade
of
rocks
and
barrens
there
was
his
danger
a
chance
shot
might
get
him
when
they
emerged
before
he
found
the
cover
again
but
leaping
from
rock
to
rock
he
managed
to
reach
the
path
upon
the
other
side
and
their
shots
went
wild
when
he
reached
cover
he
halted
a
moment
for
a
breath
firing
a
shot
in
the
direction
of
the
advancing
men
who
promptly
dropped
to
cover
and
when
they
came
on
again
he
had
gained
a
clear
lead
of
a
hundred
yards
or
more
he
had
foreseen
his
greatest
danger
of
being
caught
in
thick
underbrush
and
surrounded
so
he
kept
to
the
main
path
only
leaving
it
for
a
smaller
and
more
tortuous
one
when
the
other
turned
down
the
mountain
toward
the
road
again
since
the
exchange
of
shots
his
pursuers
had
become
more
cautious
and
when
they
reached
the
fork
of
the
paths
they
stopped
sweating
in
their
heavy
coats
and
cursing
lustily
while
they
debated
upon
the
question
as
to
which
path
he
had
taken
the
hounds
were
at
fault
from
a
point
above
he
could
see
them
quite
clearly
and
one
of
them
was
the
fatalist
who
had
been
his
jailor
last
evening
just
to
discover
whether
he
was
sincere
in
his
philosophy
hammersley
sent
a
bullet
skipping
above
his
head
he
ducked
and
hammersley
laughed
silly
ass
he
muttered
fatalist
fatality
if
i
d
aimed
at
him
and
he
was
off
again
for
other
men
had
joined
the
leaders
and
the
scent
was
hot
he
carried
them
fast
up
to
the
bald
top
of
the
mountain
where
the
going
was
faster
and
down
in
the
valley
to
the
right
they
had
gained
nothing
on
him
and
hammersley
with
his
second
wind
was
breathing
more
easily
but
it
was
almost
time
to
double
here
was
as
good
a
place
as
another
for
the
pack
of
them
to
spend
the
afternoon
and
he
made
up
his
mind
to
lose
them
without
further
ado
there
was
only
one
runner
in
the
lot
and
he
was
the
fatalist
though
how
he
had
ever
happened
to
learn
to
run
in
the
imperial
navy
hammersley
had
not
the
time
or
inclination
to
decide
if
his
philosophy
limped
his
legs
at
least
were
strong
and
he
came
on
rapidly
leaping
like
a
young
buck
toward
the
opening
over
the
crest
of
the
knob
into
which
hammersley
had
disappeared
a
short
way
down
was
a
spur
of
rock
the
beginnings
of
a
ridge
which
cut
out
into
the
hills
the
watershed
of
two
rills
which
leaped
from
rock
to
rock
to
the
valleys
below
hammersley
chose
the
valley
for
the
going
was
better
and
went
down
it
at
top
speed
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
or
more
pausing
where
the
path
led
into
the
underbrush
and
pines
until
the
fatalist
should
view
him
when
he
disappeared
and
then
turning
into
the
thicket
circled
quickly
to
the
left
and
taking
advantage
of
every
cover
slowly
and
carefully
climbed
the
ridge
to
a
place
of
vantage
where
he
crouched
and
waited
to
have
the
satisfaction
a
moment
later
of
seeing
his
weapon
in
hand
go
plunging
down
the
path
past
his
place
of
concealment
hammersley
listened
a
moment
to
the
sounds
of
crashing
feet
in
front
of
him
and
behind
and
then
creeping
slowly
and
making
what
speed
he
could
crossed
the
ridge
and
in
a
while
was
out
of
sight
and
hearing
of
them
he
feared
little
in
crossing
the
other
valley
for
his
pursuers
were
strung
out
in
a
line
each
in
sight
of
the
other
and
would
follow
the
leader
like
a
flock
of
sheep
but
there
was
little
time
to
waste
and
the
greatest
test
of
hammersley
s
endurance
and
doris
s
was
to
come
for
two
perhaps
three
hours
these
men
would
search
for
him
and
more
would
come
the
fatalist
would
bear
the
brunt
of
their
failure
but
in
the
meanwhile
hammersley
must
reach
the
cave
in
the
thorwald
and
take
doris
to
blaufelden
the
first
part
of
the
return
run
must
be
done
at
top
speed
to
save
time
which
would
be
needed
later
so
when
he
crossed
the
second
valley
in
safety
and
had
reached
the
mountaintop
hammersley
abandoned
all
caution
risking
the
chance
of
meeting
wentz
and
his
men
and
with
a
sharp
lookout
ahead
of
him
went
as
fast
as
he
could
along
the
ridge
finding
at
last
the
trail
by
which
he
had
come
earlier
in
the
day
down
which
he
ran
with
a
long
stride
which
covered
the
four
miles
in
less
than
half
an
hour
he
reached
the
upper
passage
to
the
cave
in
safety
and
in
a
moment
was
safe
behind
the
projecting
bowlders
of
the
amphitheater
he
was
breathing
heavily
and
the
sweat
was
pouring
from
him
doris
was
watching
for
him
they
re
following
you
they
re
coming
she
asked
nervously
he
quieted
her
and
led
her
inside
the
cave
where
he
dropped
for
a
moment
of
rest
upon
the
stool
doris
watched
him
anxiously
in
a
moment
he
was
laughing
oh
i
led
em
a
rippin
run
straight
for
schÃ¶ndorf
he
gasped
they
re
pattin
me
out
six
miles
from
here
on
the
top
of
the
schmalzberg
lord
he
grinned
but
that
was
a
she
brought
him
the
pitcher
of
water
but
he
only
rinsed
his
mouth
how
are
you
feelin
fit
she
nodded
come
along
we
re
he
went
over
to
the
prisoner
and
examined
his
bonds
carefully
poor
old
udo
he
muttered
in
german
i
ve
got
to
go
you
might
worry
through
those
strings
it
s
the
only
way
because
i
m
not
leaving
any
he
leaned
over
and
patted
his
cousin
on
the
shoulder
udo
he
said
we
ll
meet
again
some
day
as
friends
my
cousin
as
von
winden
s
eyes
met
hammersley
s
and
then
he
lowered
his
head
upon
the
balsam
boughs
there
was
no
time
for
amenities
hammersley
slipped
on
his
leather
jacket
and
cap
fastening
his
belt
outside
reloaded
his
automatic
filled
the
pockets
of
doris
s
coat
with
biscuit
and
chocolate
then
made
a
bundle
of
the
tools
and
spare
parts
which
he
selected
carefully
and
in
a
moment
he
and
doris
were
outside
on
the
ridge
peering
over
toward
the
road
below
all
was
quiet
and
they
descended
carefully
to
the
projecting
rock
pausing
there
to
listen
again
the
machine
of
wentz
which
had
been
left
near
the
crag
had
gone
on
toward
mittelwald
hammersley
smiled
the
plan
had
worked
it
was
working
they
succeed
down
in
the
bushes
at
the
foot
of
the
crag
by
the
road
they
paused
again
listening
and
then
hammersley
went
forward
peering
out
up
and
down
the
road
silence
solitude
leading
the
way
with
the
hand
of
the
girl
in
his
he
quickly
crossed
and
plunged
into
the
undergrowth
silently
until
they
had
reached
a
distance
which
would
defy
detection
from
the
road
then
hammersley
bore
to
the
right
and
went
on
rapidly
doris
s
heart
was
beating
high
with
excitement
and
hope
the
yellow
dove
could
they
reach
the
hangar
safely
and
when
there
could
they
tune
up
undetected
the
success
of
the
venture
seemed
impossible
for
there
must
still
be
men
on
guard
at
blaufelden
someone
but
as
they
went
on
through
the
wood
she
found
some
of
the
contagion
of
cyril
s
audacity
he
seemed
tireless
when
they
reached
a
trail
which
led
in
the
desired
direction
without
speaking
to
her
he
set
forward
into
a
steady
jog
trot
which
put
them
well
upon
their
way
he
turned
around
from
time
to
time
and
watched
her
and
when
he
saw
that
she
was
nearly
blown
he
slowed
down
to
a
walk
and
explained
his
plan
jolly
flyin
weather
this
once
we
re
in
the
air
they
can
t
stop
us
doris
she
s
armored
around
the
cockpit
and
engines
and
they
haven
t
anything
heavier
than
a
rifle
at
blaufelden
we
ll
go
up
the
rhine
to
the
sea
flyin
high
then
cut
to
the
left
along
the
coast
as
far
as
the
french
line
and
then
go
in
to
ypres
and
from
there
to
general
french
s
headquarters
you
can
easily
tell
by
the
lines
of
trenches
i
want
you
to
listen
carefully
i
ve
got
two
seats
and
double
control
the
arrangement
is
just
the
same
as
on
your
nieuport
only
she
answers
her
control
much
more
slowly
the
wheel
is
on
a
universal
joint
the
gas
on
your
wheel
the
spark
to
your
left
the
magneto
a
button
in
front
of
you
she
starts
by
compressed
but
the
exhaust
cyril
she
gasped
before
we
go
it
s
only
a
few
hundred
yards
from
the
shed
to
the
house
we
re
going
to
risk
that
with
luck
we
ll
be
movin
in
three
minutes
and
then
he
paused
grimly
and
then
i
d
like
to
see
a
dozen
stop
he
had
such
perfect
assurance
that
all
doubt
left
her
indeed
to
doris
he
seemed
endowed
with
some
hidden
fount
of
initiative
and
inspiration
and
she
was
willing
to
believe
anything
he
told
her
they
went
on
rapidly
while
he
answered
all
her
questions
and
gave
her
final
instructions
until
at
last
they
reached
a
path
the
same
he
told
her
by
which
they
had
come
from
the
farm
last
night
they
started
up
a
frightened
deer
which
fled
away
from
them
but
they
didn
t
pause
until
the
path
cut
sharply
to
the
right
and
through
the
bushes
they
could
see
the
buildings
of
blaufelden
there
they
stopped
and
hammersley
went
forward
to
investigate
in
the
direction
of
the
farmhouse
was
no
sign
of
animation
except
the
thread
of
smoke
that
rose
from
the
kitchen
chimney
the
back
of
the
hangar
was
just
in
front
of
them
a
bare
wall
of
wood
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
long
the
opening
was
upon
the
other
side
to
the
west
a
huge
canvas
flap
toggled
at
the
bottom
to
rings
in
the
sill
hammersley
came
back
and
whispered
to
doris
to
follow
him
until
the
starting
of
the
engine
this
was
the
most
hazardous
part
of
the
proceeding
for
if
they
were
seen
from
the
house
there
would
be
no
time
for
hammersley
to
put
the
engines
in
order
he
led
her
south
to
a
point
in
the
woods
where
the
storehouse
hid
them
from
the
main
buildings
when
crouching
low
to
avoid
possible
detection
from
the
windenberg
road
they
covered
the
fifty
yards
to
the
storehouse
and
waited
again
completely
hidden
from
all
points
except
the
forest
behind
them
while
cyril
looked
around
the
edge
of
the
building
and
then
beckoned
to
her
to
follow
in
a
moment
they
had
slipped
between
the
end
of
the
canvas
flap
and
the
door
and
were
within
the
dusky
interior
of
the
shed
before
them
stretched
the
wide
expanse
of
the
yellow
dove
a
huge
biplane
with
a
spread
as
nearly
as
doris
could
figure
it
of
a
hundred
and
twenty
feet
from
tip
to
tip
she
stood
before
it
in
wonder
and
awe
admiring
its
fine
lines
and
sturdy
appearance
a
her
nieuport
was
beside
this
great
eagle
of
the
air
the
other
machine
an
etrich
monoplane
which
was
used
by
udo
von
winden
seemed
lost
in
the
shadows
of
the
larger
wings
doris
stood
quite
still
as
cyril
had
directed
while
he
moved
off
noiselessly
in
the
dim
light
she
saw
him
slipping
from
one
spot
to
another
quickly
examining
this
and
that
and
at
last
saw
him
climb
up
into
the
machine
with
his
kit
of
tools
she
came
nearer
as
he
whispered
down
to
her
they
ve
taken
out
some
plugs
i
ll
have
em
in
and
then
go
around
the
lower
plane
and
tell
me
if
the
guys
are
all
she
did
as
he
asked
while
she
heard
him
above
working
over
the
engines
how
long
will
it
take
she
whispered
i
can
t
tell
twenty
minutes
perhaps
the
petrol
tanks
are
empty
i
want
to
are
the
wires
all
fast
good
then
bring
me
the
hose
from
the
petrol
tank
it
s
there
beside
you
in
the
corner
you
can
run
it
in
while
i
m
workin
she
did
as
she
was
bid
climbing
up
with
a
feeling
of
exultation
into
the
tall
machine
beside
him
the
reserve
tank
first
he
whispered
up
here
between
the
planes
here
s
a
wrench
the
opening
is
on
the
they
worked
side
by
side
noiselessly
and
efficiently
hammersley
fitting
the
missing
and
connecting
a
new
coil
wire
which
had
been
removed
he
looked
over
the
machine
carefully
but
could
find
nothing
else
missing
or
even
needing
adjustment
for
he
had
taken
care
yesterday
morning
as
was
his
custom
to
go
over
the
engine
with
his
own
hands
the
impairment
of
the
engine
was
of
no
serious
consequence
and
intended
only
to
delay
von
stromberg
had
not
counted
on
such
a
chance
for
readjustment
as
this
or
upon
hammersley
s
reserve
supply
of
necessary
material
and
unless
they
had
done
something
else
that
he
could
not
discover
but
what
while
he
worked
hammersley
tried
to
think
casting
between
times
anxious
glances
at
the
gears
the
propellers
and
the
control
wires
the
reserve
tank
of
petrol
was
filled
and
the
hose
was
steadily
pouring
the
stuff
into
the
one
under
the
forward
cockpit
which
was
full
by
the
time
the
plugs
and
wires
were
all
adjusted
that
will
be
enough
doris
he
whispered
we
only
need
to
get
to
the
english
lines
there
s
no
time
for
she
saw
him
try
the
wheel
watching
the
connecting
gear
keenly
and
when
he
ordered
it
she
climbed
down
into
the
rear
seat
he
gave
her
a
leather
coat
gloves
and
helmet
and
buckled
her
into
her
seat
then
in
a
state
of
nervous
tension
they
waited
she
saw
cyril
climb
down
coolly
wiping
his
hands
with
a
piece
of
waste
restore
the
hose
to
its
place
and
then
peer
out
from
a
slit
in
the
canvas
door
then
he
bent
over
and
running
quickly
along
the
flap
from
side
to
side
one
after
another
quickly
unfastened
the
toggles
which
held
it
in
place
we
ve
got
to
chance
it
now
he
whispered
up
to
her
if
she
doesn
t
work
god
help
us
but
the
canvas
the
machine
will
he
stopped
abruptly
for
doris
s
eyes
were
staring
in
panic
at
something
behind
him
hammersley
whirled
quickly
toward
the
slit
in
the
canvas
his
automatic
in
his
hand
there
not
four
paces
away
blinking
into
the
dusk
stood
the
tall
figure
of
his
excellency
general
graf
von
stromberg
chapter
xxii
from
the
heights
hammersley
had
him
covered
and
the
general
made
no
move
to
defend
himself
he
bent
his
head
and
folded
his
arms
peering
into
hammersley
s
eyes
like
a
man
trying
to
adjust
his
vision
to
an
unaccustomed
task
but
his
frown
relaxed
almost
immediately
and
his
lips
separated
showing
a
gleam
of
teeth
my
compliments
herr
hammersley
he
said
you
have
done
well
it
pleases
me
to
meet
at
last
move
your
right
hand
again
the
fraction
of
an
inch
and
i
will
shoot
excellenz
said
hammersley
in
the
sharp
quick
accents
of
a
resolute
man
von
stromberg
only
smiled
more
broadly
but
he
did
not
move
he
had
seen
enough
of
herr
hammersley
to
respect
his
sincerity
i
have
staked
my
professional
reputation
upon
your
presence
elsewhere
herr
hammersley
instinct
perhaps
led
me
here
i
do
not
know
what
else
but
i
came
alone
i
am
not
hammersley
was
in
no
mood
for
trifling
and
time
was
flying
better
to
shoot
the
man
and
be
done
with
it
but
he
couldn
t
somehow
instead
he
searched
him
quickly
for
weapons
you
re
too
late
excellenz
i
am
sorry
but
i
have
no
time
for
you
will
at
least
let
me
pay
you
the
compliment
of
saying
that
the
prussian
blood
in
you
has
made
you
the
most
brilliant
englishman
i
have
ever
i
have
no
time
to
match
phrases
with
you
but
you
match
what
is
much
more
important
a
genius
for
dissimulation
yesterday
you
disappointed
me
herr
hammersley
with
your
talk
of
plans
of
fortifications
of
strassburg
i
had
been
hoping
that
you
were
playing
a
deeper
game
something
that
would
relieve
the
flat
monotony
of
my
routine
you
were
to
save
me
from
utter
boredom
it
is
true
i
had
hoped
that
i
was
disappointed
when
i
thought
that
you
were
like
the
others
disappointed
i
should
have
known
and
now
that
i
have
the
papers
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
asked
hammersley
with
a
touch
of
bravado
von
stromberg
shrugged
i
confess
that
i
am
so
rapt
in
admiration
of
your
genius
that
i
am
at
a
loss
i
must
yield
to
the
inevitable
but
i
am
happy
in
the
knowledge
that
only
a
person
of
the
skill
of
herr
hammersley
could
have
succeeded
in
outwitting
the
head
of
the
secret
service
department
of
the
enough
of
this
hammersley
broke
in
i
should
kill
you
general
von
stromberg
but
i
won
t
if
you
obey
me
promptly
stand
aside
over
there
against
the
wall
if
you
move
i
ll
shoot
i
m
going
out
of
von
stromberg
did
as
he
was
bidden
and
his
long
strides
and
erect
carriage
had
lost
none
of
their
dignity
when
he
reached
the
wall
he
turned
with
a
smile
then
he
said
suavely
i
fear
herr
hammersley
that
you
will
not
go
forth
as
rapidly
as
you
hammersley
only
laughed
at
him
we
ll
see
about
he
took
a
stride
to
the
canvas
curtain
and
had
a
quick
look
outside
and
then
to
the
girl
crank
her
doris
the
compressed
air
the
button
to
the
left
beside
the
wheel
there
was
a
long
pause
when
doris
reached
forward
in
her
seat
a
pause
filled
with
meanings
for
hammersley
in
which
his
fate
and
hers
was
hanging
in
the
balance
von
stromberg
seemed
to
read
his
thoughts
and
the
wolfish
smile
spread
again
over
his
face
it
is
just
possible
he
said
blandly
that
someone
may
have
been
tinkering
with
the
there
was
another
long
silence
a
moment
of
agony
for
hammersley
yes
have
roared
hammersley
exultantly
for
just
then
there
was
a
violent
explosion
deafening
in
the
enclosed
space
like
the
roar
of
a
giant
cracker
would
have
been
another
and
then
more
rapidly
another
followed
by
a
number
of
concussions
like
a
pack
of
giant
crackers
catching
intermittently
and
then
in
quick
succession
general
von
stromberg
s
smile
faded
then
vanished
in
a
look
of
inefficacy
and
dismay
he
was
senile
hammersley
s
grin
derided
him
speech
was
impossible
but
the
muzzle
of
the
automatic
was
as
eloquent
as
before
one
more
explosion
or
six
for
that
matter
would
add
little
to
the
din
von
stromberg
s
life
hung
by
a
hair
at
that
moment
and
he
knew
it
still
covering
his
excellency
who
was
now
glancing
at
the
slit
in
the
curtain
beside
him
hammersley
climbed
up
to
the
seat
in
front
of
doris
in
the
cockpit
of
the
machine
and
just
as
he
was
putting
a
leg
over
his
excellency
took
a
quick
glance
upward
which
had
in
it
a
world
of
expression
and
bolted
hammersley
s
shot
must
have
missed
he
looked
around
at
doris
and
laughed
and
she
saw
the
light
of
triumph
that
rode
in
his
eyes
the
exhaust
was
roaring
steadily
now
but
with
one
hand
on
the
wheel
and
in
the
other
his
automatic
hammersley
sat
motionless
watching
the
slits
in
the
canvas
for
the
men
that
he
knew
must
come
in
a
moment
at
a
gesture
of
his
doris
sank
low
in
the
cockpit
her
hands
on
the
wheel
watching
too
and
ready
to
do
her
share
as
cyril
had
directed
one
two
minutes
passed
she
seemed
to
be
counting
the
seconds
the
body
of
the
machine
was
trembling
as
though
with
the
excitement
of
the
moment
and
the
explosions
had
blended
into
one
continuous
roar
cyril
threw
the
clutch
in
and
the
note
lowered
as
the
propellers
began
to
whirr
the
huge
fabric
jumped
forward
gathering
momentum
as
it
went
until
by
the
time
it
reached
the
canvas
curtain
in
front
of
it
it
was
going
as
fast
as
a
man
would
run
the
weight
of
the
heavy
flap
retarded
it
for
a
moment
but
it
went
steadily
on
and
the
canvas
was
pushed
outward
then
rose
it
seemed
to
doris
like
the
curtain
on
a
melodrama
men
were
running
up
shooting
as
they
ran
they
clutched
at
the
toggles
and
swung
off
their
feet
falling
in
a
heap
upon
the
ground
she
saw
a
man
the
only
one
not
in
uniform
take
hold
of
the
lower
plane
and
try
to
stop
the
momentum
it
was
john
rizzio
she
saw
his
face
for
a
second
dark
handsome
smiling
cyril
rose
in
his
seat
and
their
weapons
streamed
fire
rizzio
moved
backward
with
the
machine
still
clinging
to
the
lower
plane
and
then
disappeared
passing
under
it
just
where
the
blades
of
the
propeller
were
a
slight
shock
and
a
shapeless
mass
went
rolling
over
and
over
until
it
brought
up
motionless
against
the
jamb
of
the
door
two
other
men
foresters
warned
by
rizzio
s
fate
sprang
aside
with
horror
in
their
eyes
doris
sank
lower
in
her
seat
her
cheeks
bloodless
grasping
her
wheel
with
icy
hands
filled
with
horror
cyril
had
sunk
down
in
his
seat
clutching
at
the
side
of
the
cockpit
his
weapon
falling
from
his
fingers
with
an
effort
she
steadied
her
hold
on
the
wheel
the
canvas
curtain
had
passed
over
their
heads
they
were
in
the
open
to
the
right
coming
from
the
windenberg
road
a
machine
filled
with
men
was
dashing
across
the
field
before
them
at
a
diagonal
which
would
intercept
them
she
heard
shots
near
at
hand
cyril
did
not
move
she
had
a
glimpse
of
general
von
stromberg
who
had
snatched
a
pistol
from
the
hand
of
the
nearest
soldier
and
fired
they
were
moving
fast
but
the
automobile
in
the
field
before
them
seemed
to
be
moving
faster
captain
wentz
and
four
men
she
saw
cyril
s
hand
rise
in
front
of
her
pointing
to
the
left
to
avoid
them
but
wentz
came
on
the
yellow
dove
was
still
running
on
its
wheels
she
saw
the
danger
wentz
was
aiming
at
a
collision
she
pulled
her
wheel
toward
her
instinctively
and
the
yellow
dove
rose
skimming
the
ground
she
felt
it
lifting
slowly
now
rapidly
the
automobile
seemed
about
to
strike
them
another
jerk
on
the
wheel
and
the
skids
of
the
yellow
dove
just
grazed
the
of
the
machine
and
a
soldier
leaped
into
the
air
trying
to
catch
a
hold
missed
and
tumbled
to
the
ground
in
the
car
men
were
shouting
like
demons
and
a
volley
of
pistol
bullets
pierced
the
planes
she
felt
them
strike
the
armored
body
but
she
sank
lower
clutching
her
wheel
clear
they
must
be
a
second
of
agonized
suspense
and
she
saw
cyril
turn
his
head
and
look
down
behind
them
his
face
was
white
but
his
eye
flashed
triumph
his
lips
moved
but
she
heard
nothing
safe
they
must
be
the
yellow
dove
mounting
easily
had
cleared
the
trees
at
the
border
of
the
farm
and
before
the
eyes
of
the
girl
stretched
only
undulating
surfaces
of
gray
and
green
in
front
of
her
cyril
lay
back
in
his
seat
his
hands
clutched
the
sides
of
the
cockpit
o
god
she
had
not
been
sure
before
what
his
sudden
lassitude
had
meant
he
had
been
hit
john
rizzio
he
turned
around
and
smiled
at
her
and
one
hand
stretched
before
him
pointed
up
and
to
the
right
her
throat
closed
and
her
heart
seemed
to
stop
its
beating
and
the
dove
for
a
moment
swung
and
tossed
like
a
drunken
thing
but
with
an
effort
she
inclined
her
wheel
and
met
it
cyril
again
raised
his
fingers
and
pointed
upwards
higher
she
tipped
the
wheel
further
toward
her
his
gesture
was
like
an
appeal
to
heaven
a
symbol
of
his
faith
in
her
and
in
the
god
of
both
she
set
her
lips
and
obeyed
broken
and
helpless
perhaps
dying
he
was
putting
his
faith
in
her
she
must
not
fail
him
now
she
kept
her
gaze
before
her
over
cyril
s
head
trying
to
gain
strength
for
what
she
had
to
do
thinking
that
she
was
in
england
at
ashwater
park
and
that
the
wheel
she
held
was
that
of
her
own
little
nieuport
there
seemed
to
be
little
difference
between
them
except
that
the
yellow
dove
was
easier
to
manage
it
responded
to
the
slightest
touch
and
had
a
magnificent
steadiness
that
reassured
doris
as
to
her
ability
to
do
the
thing
that
was
required
of
her
the
mountains
had
fallen
below
them
and
the
horizon
had
widened
until
it
blurred
into
the
haze
of
the
distance
she
looked
down
on
what
seemed
to
her
a
plain
of
purple
velvet
touched
with
lighter
patches
of
orange
and
violet
before
her
the
sun
was
setting
blood
red
in
a
sea
of
amber
she
mounted
above
it
into
the
clear
empyrean
of
azure
higher
higher
yet
she
felt
the
exhilaration
of
large
spaces
the
joy
of
conquest
over
all
material
things
death
even
did
not
dismay
her
cyril
s
her
own
she
seemed
to
have
crossed
at
a
bound
from
the
realm
of
substance
into
that
of
immateriality
her
soul
already
sang
in
accord
with
the
angels
they
were
mated
she
and
cyril
mated
and
even
death
should
not
separate
them
dusk
fell
slowly
below
them
like
a
black
giant
striding
across
the
face
of
the
earth
but
all
was
still
bright
and
clear
about
her
the
red
ball
of
the
sun
would
not
set
she
was
going
upward
upward
into
the
realm
of
continuous
and
perfect
day
below
her
a
thread
of
silk
thrown
carelessly
upon
a
purple
carpet
the
rhine
she
saw
cyril
s
hand
come
up
and
move
feebly
to
the
right
she
turned
slowly
and
followed
its
direction
the
rhine
she
remembered
cyril
s
words
back
there
in
the
woods
she
must
follow
the
rhine
to
the
sea
and
then
turn
to
the
westward
along
the
coast
she
would
do
it
she
must
cyril
was
hurt
but
perhaps
not
badly
his
gestures
reassured
her
he
moved
his
hand
in
a
level
line
in
front
of
him
and
she
understood
they
had
mounted
high
enough
the
barograph
showed
four
thousand
feet
she
brought
the
wheel
up
to
normal
and
held
it
there
the
wind
burned
her
cheeks
and
she
knew
from
the
changes
in
the
river
below
her
that
the
speed
of
the
yellow
dove
was
terrific
ninety
miles
a
hundred
a
hundred
and
twenty
an
hour
perhaps
much
more
she
did
not
know
the
speed
got
into
her
blood
faster
faster
was
the
song
her
pulses
sung
she
was
a
part
of
the
yellow
dove
now
and
it
was
a
part
of
herself
its
wings
were
her
wings
and
its
instinct
was
in
her
own
fingertips
night
fell
slowly
a
luminous
night
full
of
stars
she
seemed
to
be
hanging
among
them
to
be
one
of
them
watching
the
earth
pass
under
her
two
of
them
gleamed
like
elmo
s
lights
at
the
tips
of
the
planes
the
sky
was
clear
and
bright
of
a
deep
bluish
purple
like
the
skies
she
remembered
high
up
on
the
plains
of
the
great
west
in
her
own
country
the
air
was
bitter
cold
upon
her
face
and
she
blessed
cyril
s
foresight
for
the
helmet
gloves
and
old
leather
jacket
that
he
had
put
on
her
in
the
hangar
in
front
of
her
cyril
leaned
slightly
to
one
side
and
his
right
hand
touched
a
button
throwing
an
electric
light
in
a
hood
in
front
of
the
wheel
upon
the
face
of
the
compass
and
barograph
she
glanced
at
them
quickly
four
thousand
feet
the
direction
she
longed
to
speak
to
him
and
shouted
his
name
but
in
the
roar
of
the
engines
she
could
not
hear
her
own
voice
he
still
sat
up
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
moving
from
time
to
time
as
he
gave
her
the
direction
she
thanked
god
for
that
he
was
alive
he
would
live
until
they
reached
ypres
he
live
he
she
set
her
teeth
upon
the
words
and
it
praying
at
last
aloud
with
lips
that
screamed
yet
made
no
sound
below
her
moved
the
lights
of
a
city
she
did
not
know
what
it
was
cologne
perhaps
she
had
passed
it
yesterday
morning
in
the
train
with
john
rizzio
yesterday
it
seemed
a
year
ago
cologne
then
dusseldorf
the
river
was
not
difficult
to
follow
she
lost
it
once
and
then
moving
at
a
lower
altitude
she
found
it
quickly
but
the
old
terror
was
gripping
her
now
cyril
his
fingers
no
longer
moved
directing
her
he
had
sunk
lower
in
his
seat
and
his
head
had
fallen
back
upon
one
side
his
face
upturned
to
the
stars
was
he
she
put
the
thought
from
her
it
was
impossible
she
had
prayed
not
that
he
had
only
fainted
from
pain
from
sickness
not
dead
she
would
not
could
not
believe
it
she
longed
to
reach
forward
to
let
him
feel
her
hand
upon
his
neck
that
he
might
know
her
pity
and
her
pain
it
almost
seemed
better
that
death
should
come
to
them
both
now
than
that
he
should
die
and
not
know
the
comforting
touch
of
her
hand
she
leaned
forward
and
one
hand
left
the
wheel
but
she
lost
her
touch
of
the
air
and
the
planes
tipped
drunkenly
threatening
the
destruction
she
courted
the
madness
passed
and
with
its
passing
came
a
calm
she
was
no
longer
a
sentient
being
she
was
merely
an
instinct
with
wings
flying
as
the
eagle
flies
straight
for
its
goal
she
kept
her
glance
on
the
compass
and
followed
the
river
the
silver
thread
had
become
a
ribbon
now
reflecting
the
starlight
she
passed
over
other
towns
she
could
see
their
lights
but
her
gaze
was
fixed
most
often
on
the
distant
horizon
where
after
a
while
she
would
find
the
sea
a
yellowish
light
painting
the
under
side
of
the
plane
above
her
head
bewildered
her
she
could
not
understand
it
was
like
a
reflection
of
a
candle
inside
a
tent
low
as
it
was
it
blinded
her
eyes
accustomed
to
the
soft
light
of
the
stars
there
was
a
crash
nearby
in
the
very
air
beside
her
it
seemed
a
blinding
flash
of
light
and
the
yellow
dove
toppled
sideways
instinctively
she
caught
it
turning
as
she
went
and
rose
higher
higher
as
a
bird
flies
at
the
sound
of
a
shot
below
she
knew
now
what
it
meant
a
searchlight
they
were
firing
at
her
with
the
guns
she
had
come
fast
but
the
wire
from
windenberg
had
been
faster
she
put
the
light
behind
her
and
long
arms
of
light
still
groped
for
her
but
she
rose
still
higher
five
six
thousand
feet
her
barograph
told
her
below
to
her
right
a
small
thing
shaped
like
a
was
spitting
fire
to
her
left
another
but
she
sank
lower
in
her
seat
laughing
at
them
something
of
cyril
s
joyous
bravado
possessed
her
she
defied
them
rising
far
above
them
higher
seven
thousand
feet
eight
until
she
could
see
them
no
more
she
found
her
course
again
and
flew
on
into
the
night
she
had
lost
the
river
but
that
did
not
matter
now
she
knew
that
after
a
time
an
hour
or
more
she
must
come
to
the
sea
and
when
all
signs
of
danger
were
gone
she
went
down
again
where
she
could
more
plainly
see
the
earth
the
moon
had
come
up
and
bathed
the
scene
below
with
its
soft
light
and
far
ahead
of
her
she
saw
irregular
streaks
of
pale
gray
against
long
lines
of
purplish
black
the
sea
she
had
lost
all
idea
of
time
and
distance
how
far
the
sea
was
from
windenberg
she
did
not
know
and
if
she
had
known
it
the
passage
of
time
was
a
blank
to
her
a
continuous
roar
the
music
of
the
spheres
which
took
no
thought
of
time
or
space
the
flight
had
lasted
but
a
minute
and
an
eternity
to
her
left
the
gray
streaks
were
nearer
west
by
north
her
compass
said
and
she
steered
for
them
soon
she
made
out
distinctly
contours
of
large
masses
of
gray
against
the
black
water
and
land
the
air
was
milder
and
she
sniffed
the
salt
she
went
down
to
three
thousand
feet
to
get
her
bearings
ever
watchful
for
the
and
ready
to
soar
again
at
the
first
flash
of
a
searchlight
she
had
already
learned
to
avoid
the
planes
where
the
lights
were
grouped
the
colonies
of
that
here
meant
danger
had
she
crossed
the
belgian
line
she
had
been
to
antwerp
to
brussels
and
tried
to
remember
what
they
had
looked
like
on
the
map
there
was
water
near
antwerp
she
remembered
that
inland
bodies
of
water
which
led
to
the
sea
now
she
could
see
beyond
the
bodies
of
inland
water
to
a
wide
expanse
of
gray
beyond
the
dark
uninterrupted
gray
the
ocean
she
bore
to
her
left
until
her
course
was
due
west
a
searchlight
flashed
upon
her
for
a
second
and
was
gone
by
the
way
the
contours
were
changing
she
knew
that
her
speed
was
terrific
and
slowly
but
more
and
more
certainly
as
she
neared
the
sea
a
problem
presented
itself
her
goal
where
was
it
and
how
to
find
it
in
the
dark
cyril
had
said
that
they
must
land
back
of
ypres
but
where
was
ypres
beyond
ostend
and
inland
thirty
forty
miles
she
knew
that
much
from
the
war
maps
that
she
had
pored
over
with
her
father
but
how
to
find
it
she
was
over
the
sea
now
the
yellow
dove
felt
a
new
breeze
and
the
wheel
tugged
under
her
hand
but
the
machine
lifted
at
the
touch
and
wheeled
like
a
gull
to
speed
down
the
coast
ostend
the
kursaal
if
she
could
get
a
sight
of
it
it
was
dangerous
but
she
must
go
lower
three
two
hundred
feet
from
the
sea
where
she
might
make
out
familiar
profiles
against
the
sky
the
waves
rose
to
meet
her
reflecting
the
starlight
and
just
below
her
to
the
left
the
surf
rolled
in
lines
of
white
upon
the
beach
dunes
dunes
interminably
with
here
and
there
a
collection
of
huts
a
dark
shape
moved
in
the
water
ahead
of
her
another
warships
destroyers
she
wheeled
out
to
sea
and
flew
above
them
but
before
they
had
time
even
to
get
their
searchlights
ranged
upon
her
the
danger
was
past
she
would
win
now
the
yellow
dove
was
invincible
a
dark
irregular
mass
ahead
of
her
rose
above
the
monotony
of
dunes
buildings
and
a
bulk
she
seemed
to
recognize
a
round
dome
iridescent
like
a
soap
bubble
in
the
moonlight
the
kursaal
ostend
she
was
nearing
her
destination
the
end
of
the
german
lines
friends
were
near
belgians
french
and
english
twenty
thirty
miles
beyond
ostend
and
then
inland
somewhere
back
of
ypres
she
would
find
the
english
the
english
lines
were
thirty
or
forty
miles
long
she
remembered
it
should
not
be
difficult
to
find
them
she
must
be
sure
to
go
far
enough
but
not
too
far
not
to
where
the
french
army
joined
the
british
forces
cyril
s
papers
must
go
to
the
english
to
general
french
himself
he
had
said
so
she
had
no
way
of
judging
distance
except
by
the
passage
of
the
minutes
at
the
speed
she
was
flying
she
must
turn
inland
in
fifteen
minutes
she
had
no
watch
and
she
tried
counting
the
seconds
she
had
counted
sixty
four
times
when
a
battery
hidden
among
the
dunes
along
the
shore
opened
fire
on
her
she
was
half
a
mile
from
shore
flying
low
but
the
flash
of
light
startled
her
and
the
shell
burst
beyond
she
rose
quickly
moving
further
out
to
sea
frightened
but
still
it
would
not
do
to
fail
now
with
the
goal
in
sight
the
compass
gave
her
course
southwest
by
west
she
counted
again
guessing
at
the
time
she
had
lost
and
then
making
a
wide
spiral
out
to
sea
and
rising
to
three
thousand
feet
she
drove
the
yellow
dove
inland
searchlights
were
turned
on
her
and
shots
fired
but
she
went
higher
trying
to
make
out
if
she
could
the
lines
of
the
opposing
armies
red
and
yellow
lights
were
displayed
below
to
her
left
and
far
to
her
right
were
tiny
clusters
of
lights
but
there
seemed
to
be
no
order
in
their
arrangement
no
lines
that
she
could
distinguish
even
at
this
height
her
keen
eyes
now
inured
to
the
darkness
made
out
a
monoplane
against
the
starlight
ahead
of
her
but
she
swerved
to
the
right
the
greater
power
of
the
yellow
dove
enabling
her
to
rise
and
elude
it
she
flew
for
what
seemed
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
going
steadily
to
the
south
and
west
when
she
drove
for
a
spot
where
there
were
no
lights
and
then
shut
off
the
throttle
and
dove
she
knew
that
this
was
perhaps
the
greatest
moment
of
her
great
adventure
a
landing
place
in
the
dark
in
a
country
she
did
not
know
where
a
church
steeple
a
telegraph
wire
the
limb
of
a
tree
would
bring
her
and
her
precious
freight
to
disaster
with
the
sudden
shutting
off
of
the
power
a
silence
that
bewildered
her
a
silence
broken
only
by
the
whirr
of
the
wind
against
the
planes
her
ears
ached
from
the
change
of
pressure
in
her
swift
descent
she
eased
her
wheel
back
gently
trying
to
make
out
objects
below
dark
patches
woods
to
be
avoided
the
roof
of
a
house
another
lights
here
and
there
small
obscure
which
she
had
not
seen
she
avoided
them
all
planing
down
in
a
spiral
toward
what
seemed
to
be
unobstructed
space
she
breathed
a
prayer
as
the
earth
came
up
to
meet
her
death
whatever
came
cyril
too
she
stared
straight
before
her
feeling
out
the
wind
pressure
on
the
planes
gliding
as
near
the
horizontal
as
she
dared
an
open
field
thank
god
a
gentle
shock
and
the
springs
responded
the
yellow
dove
rebounded
slightly
and
ran
along
the
ground
smoothly
upon
its
wheels
then
stopped
she
tried
to
get
up
but
could
not
her
hands
seemed
fastened
to
the
wheel
she
heard
the
sound
of
men
s
voices
shouting
and
saw
lights
but
she
could
not
seem
to
make
a
sound
she
was
shivering
violently
also
laughing
a
little
but
she
had
no
sense
of
being
cold
she
seemed
very
weak
somehow
and
very
helpless
and
then
just
as
the
lights
grew
brighter
they
went
out
chapter
xxiii
headquarters
a
woman
she
heard
a
man
s
voice
say
at
her
ear
she
was
lying
upon
the
ground
and
strange
faces
were
bending
over
her
well
i
m
damned
english
and
the
other
she
heard
again
dead
as
a
errin
doris
sat
up
staring
at
them
wildly
wait
there
s
a
flutter
ere
she
heard
the
other
man
say
come
bill
let
s
have
im
over
to
the
doris
managed
to
find
a
whisper
a
surgeon
for
she
said
to
the
man
supporting
her
he
will
not
die
he
is
only
it
was
her
obsession
it
would
not
leave
her
she
saw
them
carrying
cyril
toward
the
house
and
when
they
wanted
to
take
her
too
she
said
that
she
would
walk
though
deathly
weak
she
managed
to
reach
the
house
where
they
had
carried
cyril
they
gave
her
a
drink
of
something
and
she
revived
it
was
a
red
cross
station
they
told
her
and
the
doctor
would
be
here
in
a
moment
but
in
the
meanwhile
first
aid
was
administered
and
at
her
place
at
his
bedside
she
saw
cyril
struggling
faintly
back
to
life
he
will
not
die
she
repeated
quietly
when
the
surgeon
had
examined
him
gravely
i
hope
not
but
he
s
bled
a
good
deal
we
ll
they
cut
away
his
coat
and
wanted
to
send
her
away
but
she
pleaded
to
remain
and
in
a
moment
she
heard
cyril
s
voice
whispering
hoarsely
papers
coat
pocket
sir
john
all
right
said
the
surgeon
cheerfully
we
ll
see
to
here
rippin
fine
of
you
no
mistake
old
girl
his
whisper
trailed
off
into
silence
and
at
the
surgeon
s
orders
they
led
her
away
from
his
cot
but
she
would
not
leave
the
room
until
she
got
the
papers
out
of
the
pocket
of
his
jacket
an
orderly
led
her
to
a
young
officer
with
his
arm
in
a
sling
who
sat
at
a
table
in
another
part
of
the
building
he
listened
to
her
story
attentively
and
read
the
documents
carefully
his
lips
as
he
read
emitting
a
thin
whistle
he
glanced
at
his
watch
and
for
a
moment
left
the
room
it
is
arranged
you
shall
go
he
said
when
he
came
back
a
machine
will
be
here
in
a
he
paused
examining
her
doubtfully
she
was
spattered
with
grease
and
oil
but
the
pallor
of
her
face
beneath
its
grime
showed
that
her
strength
was
near
its
end
wouldn
t
you
trust
those
dispatches
to
me
it
s
ten
miles
to
headquarters
and
no
no
i
will
go
i
but
he
ordered
some
hot
coffee
and
bread
and
thus
fortified
when
the
motor
came
around
she
was
driven
upon
her
way
the
young
officer
sat
beside
her
eagerly
listening
while
she
gave
him
a
brief
outline
of
their
adventures
amazin
he
said
from
time
to
time
most
amazin
and
then
as
she
went
on
he
said
quietly
you
re
goin
on
your
nerve
i
think
better
save
your
strength
until
we
get
to
headquarters
it
isn
t
far
she
tried
to
keep
silent
but
it
seemed
as
though
she
must
go
on
talking
that
seemed
to
give
her
strength
to
complete
her
task
for
when
she
sank
back
in
her
seat
and
tried
to
relax
she
only
grew
weak
thinking
of
cyril
lying
back
there
hovering
between
life
and
death
and
then
she
heard
herself
saying
aloud
he
will
not
die
he
has
gone
through
too
much
to
die
the
man
beside
her
glanced
down
at
her
and
smiled
gently
no
he
isn
t
going
to
die
bullets
don
t
kill
nowadays
unless
they
kill
at
yes
yes
she
assented
that
s
it
if
he
had
been
going
to
die
he
would
have
been
dead
now
wouldn
t
he
she
laid
her
hand
eagerly
on
the
young
officer
s
arm
and
he
put
his
hand
over

part
of
the
line

been
very
good
to
understand
everything
so
oh
it
s
nothing
there
are
reasons
i
m
on
headquarters
staff
you
that
was
one
reason
but
another
one
was
that
there
was
a
girl
at
home
just
as
much
worried
over
his
wound
as
miss
mather
was
over
hammersley
s
they
passed
from
the
rough
roads
between
gates
into
a
smoother
one
which
was
bordered
with
poplars
at
the
end
in
front
of
her
she
saw
lights
and
reached
a
doorway
where
an
orderly
opened
the
door
of
the
machine
and
saluted
her
companion
their
arrival
it
seemed
was
expected
captain
jackson
took
her
by
the
arm
and
led
her
indoors
for
her
courage
or
her
nerves
seemed
to
be
failing
her
again
down
a
quiet
hall
into
a
room
where
an
officer
with
a
gray
mustache
sat
before
a
lighted
lamp
at
a
table
covered
with
papers
she
recognized
him
at
once
from
the
many
portraits
that
had
appeared
in
the
weekly
papers
he
spoke
to
her
and
she
tried
to
reply
but
she
could
not
she
seemed
only
to
have
strength
enough
to
thrust
the
papers
forward
into
his
hand
when
her
knees
gave
way
under
her
and
she
sank
in
a
heap
upon
the
floor
gentle
hands
lifted
her
and
laid
her
upon
a
couch
in
the
corner
of
the
room
she
tried
to
get
up
but
could
not
she
heard
the
voices
of
the
officers
in
the
room
as
from
a
great
distance
and
then
a
woman
came
and
two
men
carried
her
upstairs
and
put
her
to
bed
she
realized
that
she
was
talking
incoherently
of
cyril
of
the
yellow
dove
they
gave
her
something
to
drink
and
her
nerves
grew
mysteriously
quiet
she
seemed
to
be
sailing
smoothly
through
the
air
higher
higher
cyril
s
fingers
were
pointing
upward
she
was
tipping
the
wheel
toward
her
ever
toward
her
and
they
rose
higher
they
had
reached
the
region
of
continuous
and
perfect
day
cyril
turned
his
head
and
looked
at
her
and
then
he
smiled
it
was
broad
daylight
when
she
awoke
for
the
sunshine
was
streaming
in
at
the
window
a
woman
sat
near
her
knitting
she
was
an
old
woman
of
many
wrinkles
kindly
wrinkles
which
seemed
to
vie
with
one
another
to
express
placidity
as
doris
rose
in
her
bed
the
old
woman
rose
too
and
came
forward
briskly
speaking
in
french
ah
mademoiselle
is
awake
she
is
feeling
better
yes
better
but
a
little
and
then
as
she
realized
where
she
was
could
you
tell
me
general
french
could
i
see
him
all
is
well
mademoiselle
monsieur
le
general
he
is
not
here
now
but
he
will
be
back
after
a
while
he
will
see
you
then
but
first
it
is
proper
that
you
have
breakfast
and
a
bath
mademoiselle
needs
a
bath
i
doris
glanced
at
her
hand
which
lay
upon
the
white
coverlid
it
was
black
yes
i
will
bathe
but
first
will
you
tell
me
the
old
woman
smiled
as
she
interrupted
i
was
to
tell
you
that
monsieur
yonder
is
better
that
is
what
mademoiselle
wished
to
know
is
it
not
doris
sank
back
upon
her
pillow
in
a
silence
which
gave
the
full
measure
of
her
joy
cyril
would
recover
she
had
been
sure
of
it
she
had
told
them
last
night
god
was
good
the
news
gave
her
strength
and
the
coffee
and
eggs
that
were
brought
revived
her
rapidly
her
nerves
still
trembled
in
memory
of
what
they
had
passed
through
but
when
she
was
bathed
and
dressed
in
clean
linen
garments
much
too
large
for
her
a
surgeon
brought
her
medicine
and
what
was
better
than
medicine
news
that
cyril
was
conscious
and
was
asking
for
her
but
they
would
not
let
her
go
to
him
tomorrow
perhaps
meanwhile
the
doctor
would
be
glad
to
take
a
message
doris
colored
gently
the
message
that
she
would
have
liked
to
send
was
not
to
be
transmitted
by
this
means
tell
him
she
said
at
last
quietly
that
i
am
well
and
that
i
will
see
him
when
i
have
permission
to
do
the
officer
smiled
gave
some
directions
to
the
old
woman
and
went
out
it
was
not
until
late
in
the
afternoon
when
dressed
in
her
own
garments
which
had
been
carefully
cleansed
and
brushed
by
her
nurse
that
she
was
admitted
to
the
office
of
the
field
marshal
she
was
shown
into
his
room
and
he
greeted
her
with
unmistakable
cordiality
offering
her
the
chair
next
his
own
and
congratulating
her
warmly
upon
the
success
of
her
achievement
and
cyril
s
you
know
he
asked
quietly
the
contents
of
these
documents
yes
their
importance
made
it
necessary
that
i
then
of
course
you
realize
the
necessity
for
the
utmost
secrecy
i
the
general
smiled
at
her
and
brought
forward
a
copy
of
a
recent
issue
of
the
london
did
you
know
that
for
the
past
three
days
england
has
actually
stopped
criticizing
me
to
talk
about
you
about
she
asked
yes
read
he
said
smiling
and
she
took
the
paper
from
him
skimming
the
headings
of
a
news
item
he
pointed
out
to
her
miss
mather
still
missing
mysterious
disappearance
still
unaccounted
for
lady
heathcote
tells
strange
story
john
rizzio
the
famous
collector
a
german
spy
and
then
in
the
news
item
below
allison
mather
of
ashwater
park
believing
that
his
daughter
is
still
alive
today
offered
a
reward
of
five
thousand
pounds
to
anyone
she
stopped
reading
and
put
the
paper
down
poor
daddy
she
whispered
o
sir
john
will
you
let
him
know
i
have
already
done
so
child
he
knows
that
you
are
and
then
with
a
laugh
the
five
thousand
pounds
i
think
are
mine
i
need
a
new
hospital
oh
he
ll
give
it
i
m
you
promise
he
took
her
hand
and
rose
in
the
act
of
dismissal
we
have
supper
at
six
i
hope
you
will
be
able
to
join
but
general
she
paused
at
the
door
he
smiled
at
her
softly
if
all
goes
well
you
shall
see
him
she
colored
prettily
everyone
seemed
to
know
but
she
didn
t
care
the
world
in
spite
of
its
terrors
was
a
garden
of
roses
to
doris
she
did
not
see
cyril
the
next
day
or
the
one
following
his
temperature
had
risen
and
while
the
danger
of
a
relapse
was
not
acute
they
thought
it
safer
that
she
be
kept
away
she
had
worried
fearing
the
worst
but
the
frankness
of
the
head
surgeon
reassured
her
the
bullet
had
drilled
through
him
just
scraping
the
lung
he
would
recover
but
why
take
a
chance
of
complication
when
all
was
going
well
there
was
no
reply
to
that
so
doris
waited
at
headquarters
thankful
and
trying
to
be
patient
sending
two
penciled
scrawls
which
were
delivered
to
the
wounded
man
it
was
not
until
three
days
later
that
she
received
word
that
she
would
be
permitted
to
see
him
his
cot
had
been
carried
into
a
small
room
at
the
front
of
the
building
and
she
entered
it
timidly
the
nurse
with
a
smile
and
a
glance
at
her
watch
both
of
which
were
eloquent
withdrawing
he
was
propped
up
on
pillows
and
though
pale
from
the
loss
of
blood
greeted
her
with
his
old
careless
smile
she
sank
into
the
chair
by
the
side
of
the
bed
and
caught
his
hand
to
her
lips
o
cyril
she
murmured
cyril
i
m
so
glad
but
i
knew
you
wouldn
t
die
you
couldn
t
after
getting
safely
through
everything
die
well
hardly
i
m
right
as
rain
jolly
close
shootin
that
of
rizzio
s
though
pity
he
had
to
go
that
she
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
don
t
let
s
forget
and
then
have
you
suffered
much
no
the
bally
thing
burns
a
bit
now
and
then
but
the
worst
of
it
is
they
won
t
let
a
chap
she
laughed
and
he
caught
her
hand
closer
how
did
you
do
it
doris
how
did
you
he
questioned
i
had
to
cyril
she
said
it
wasn
t
anything
except

where
to
come

bothered
me
i
guessed

ypres
the
rest

but

cold
with
reason
and
skill

poor
head

to

nurse

discreetly
and
entered
five
minutes
i

said
hammersley
with
a
sigh
three
weeks
later
they
stood
side
by
side
at
the
rail
of
the
channel
boat
on
the
way
to
ashwater
park
for
the
parental
blessing
the
shores
of
france
were
already
purple
in
the
distance
they
had
looked
upon
death
with
eyes
that
did
not
fear
but
the
sight
of
it
together
had
made
the
bond
of
their
fealty
and
tenderness
the
stronger
there
was
a
sadness
in
his
look
and
she
knew
instinctively
of
what
he
was
thinking
germany
cyril
she
said
aloud
i
love
it
because
a
part
of
it
is
you
but
i
love
england
more
because
it
hammersley
watched
the
receding
shores
beyond
the
vessel
s
wake
her
hand
in
his
they
re
followin
false
gods
doris
gods
of
steel
and
brass
they
fall
they
and
then
but
you
can
t
help
admirin
the
beggars
poor
old
udo
i
think
about
him
cyril
do
you
think
he
got
away
well
rather
i
cut
his
bonds
with
a
huntin
knife
before
we
went
she
looked
up
into
his
face
in
amazement
you
dared
do
that
he
laughed
you
wouldn
t
have
let
him
be
more
generous
than
and
he
let
us
go
he
didn
t
think
we
go
he
left
things
to
good
old
udo
she
repeated
and
then
dreamily
destiny
you
were
not
meant
to
die
not
he
said
slowly
but
i
must
go
back
over
there
she
shivered
a
little
and
drew
closer
to
him
yes
i
know
she
said
but
you
ve
earned
i
couldn
t
ever
earn
what
i
ve
got
he
broke
in
quickly
nor
i
i
m
not
much
of
a
chap
at
pretty
speeches
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
you
re
a
rare
one
you
know
the
rummiest
sort
of
a
rare
one
the
kind
a
chap
dreams
about
but
never
gets
and
yet
i
ve
got
you
oh
hang
it
all
doris
he
broke
off
helplessly
you
know
she
smiled
at
him
and
slipped
her
arm
through
his
yes
i
know
she
said
good
old
doris
he
muttered
silly
ass
aren
t
i
but
she
wouldn
t
admit
that
four
timely
books
of
international
importance
i
accuse
accuse
by
a
german
a
scathing
arraignment
of
the
german
war
policy
at
this
vital
time
in
the
nation
s
history
every
patriotic
american
should
read
and
reread
this
wonderful
book
and
learn
the
absurdity
of
the
german
excuse
that
they
wanted
a
place
in
the
learn
how
the
german
masses
were
deluded
with
the
idea
that
they
were
making
a
defensive
war
to
protect
the
fatherland
let
the
author
of
this
illuminating
book
again
show
the
sacrilege
of
claiming
a
christian
god
as
a
teutonic
ally
and
riddle
once
more
the
divine
right
of
kings
by
roland
usher
the
clear
graphic
style
gives
it
a
popular
appeal
that
sets
it
miles
apart
from
the
ordinary
treatise
and
for
the
reader
who
wishes
to
get
a
rapid
focus
on
the
world
events
of
the
present
perhaps
no
book
written
will
be
more
interesting
it
is
the
only
existing
forecast
of
exactly
the
present
development
of
events
in
europe
it
is
besides
a
brisk
clear
almost
reduction
of
the
complex
history
of
europe
during
the
last
forty
years
to
a
simple
connected
story
clear
enough
to
the
most
casual
reader
the
challenge
of
the
future
by
roland
usher
a
glance
into
america
s
future
by
the
man
who
in
his
book
foretold
with
such
amazing
accuracy
the
coming
of
the
present
european
events
an
exceedingly
live
and
timely
book
that
is
bound
to
be
read
and
discussed
widely
because
it
strikes
to
the
heart
of
american
problems
and
more
especially
because
it
hits
right
and
left
at
ideas
that
have
become
convictions
in
many
american
minds
the
evidence
in
the
case
by
james
beck
formerly
assistant
of
the
united
states
author
of
the
war
and
with
an
introduction
by
the
hon
joseph
choate
late
ambassador
to
great
britain
no
work
on
the
war
has
made
a
deeper
impression
throughout
the
