the
strange
schemes
of
randolph
mason
introduction
the
teller
of
strange
tales
is
not
the
least
among
benefactors
of
men
his
cup
of
lethe
is
welcome
at
times
even
to
the
strongest
when
the
of
the
commonplace
is
in
its
meridian
to
the
aching
victim
of
evil
fortune
it
is
ofttimes
the
divine
anaesthetic
a
bitter
critic
calls
down
to
the
storyteller
bidding
him
turn
out
with
the
hewers
of
wood
and
the
drawers
of
water
for
the
reason
that
there
is
no
new
thing
and
the
pieces
with
which
he
seeks
to
build
are
ancient
and
well
worn
at
best
he
cries
the
great
one
among
you
can
produce
but
combinations
of
the
old
some
quaint
some
monstrous
and
all
weary
but
the
writer
does
not
turn
out
and
the
world
swings
merrily
on
perhaps
the
critic
forgets
that
if
things
are
old
men
are
new
that
while
the
grain
field
stands
fast
the
waves
passing
over
it
are
not
one
like
the
other
the
new
child
is
the
best
answer
the
reader
is
a
clever
tyrant
he
demands
something
more
than
people
of
mist
there
must
be
tendons
in
the
ghost
hand
and
hard
bones
in
the
phantom
else
he
feels
that
he
has
been
cheated
perhaps
of
all
things
the
human
mind
loves
best
the
problem
not
the
problem
of
the
abacus
but
the
problem
of
the
when
the
pieces
are
living
the
problem
with
passion
and
peril
in
it
with
the
fresh
air
of
the
hills
and
the
salt
breath
of
the
sea
it
propounds
this
riddle
to
the
writer
create
o
magician
with
red
blood
in
their
faces
who
by
power
inherited
from
you
are
enabled
to
secure
the
fruits
of
drudgery
without
the
drudgery
nor
must
the
genius
of
circumstance
help
make
them
do
what
we
can
not
do
good
magician
but
make
them
of
clay
as
we
are
we
know
all
the
old
methods
so
well
and
we
are
weary
of
them
give
us
new
ones
exacting
is
this
taskmaster
it
demands
that
the
problem
builder
cunningly
join
together
the
fancy
and
the
fact
and
thereby
enchant
and
bewilder
but
not
deceive
it
demands
all
the
mighty
motives
of
life
in
the
problem
thus
it
happens
that
the
toiler
has
tramped
and
retramped
the
field
of
crime
poe
and
the
french
writers
constructed
masterpieces
in
the
early
day
later
came
the
flood
of
detective
stories
until
the
stomach
of
the
reader
failed
yesterday
conan
doyle
created
sherlock
holmes
and
the
public
pricked
up
its
ears
and
listened
with
interest
it
is
significant
that
the
general
plan
of
this
kind
of
tale
has
never
once
been
changed
to
any
degree
the
writers
one
and
all
have
labored
often
with
great
genius
to
construct
problems
in
crime
where
by
acute
deduction
the
criminal
and
his
methods
were
determined
or
reversing
it
they
have
sought
to
plan
the
crime
so
cunningly
as
to
effectually
conceal
the
criminal
and
his
methods
the
intent
has
always
been
to
baffle
the
trailer
and
when
the
identity
of
the
criminal
was
finally
revealed
the
story
ended
the
high
ground
of
the
field
of
crime
has
not
been
explored
it
has
not
even
been
entered
the
have
been
filled
to
weariness
with
tales
based
upon
plans
whereby
the
or
power
of
the
state
might
be
baffled
but
prodigious
marvel
no
writer
has
attempted
to
construct
tales
based
upon
plans
whereby
the
power
of
the
state
might
be
baffled
the
distinction
if
one
pauses
for
a
moment
to
consider
it
is
striking
it
is
possible
even
easy
deliberately
to
plan
crimes
so
that
the
criminal
agent
and
the
criminal
agency
can
not
be
detected
is
it
possible
to
plan
and
execute
wrongs
in
such
a
manner
that
they
will
have
all
the
effect
and
all
the
resulting
profit
of
desperate
crimes
and
yet
not
be
crimes
before
the
law
there
is
perhaps
nothing
of
which
the
layman
is
so
grossly
ignorant
as
of
the
law
he
has
grown
to
depend
upon
what
he
is
pleased
to
call
common
sense
indeed
his
refrain
the
law
is
common
sense
has
at
times
been
echoed
by
the
judiciary
there
was
never
a
graver
error
the
common
sense
of
the
common
man
is
at
best
a
poor
guide
to
the
criminal
law
it
is
no
guide
at
all
to
the
civil
law
there
is
here
no
legal
heresy
lord
coke
in
the
seventeenth
century
declared
that
the
law
was
not
the
natural
reason
of
man
and
that
men
could
not
out
of
their
common
reason
make
such
laws
as
the
laws
of
england
were
the
laws
have
not
grown
simpler
surely
and
if
they
could
not
be
constructed
by
the
common
reason
of
men
they
could
certainly
not
be
determined
by
it
that
men
have
but
indistinct
ideas
of
the
law
is
to
be
regretted
and
deplored
for
their
protection
they
should
know
it
and
there
is
need
of
this
protection
the
voices
of
all
men
were
not
joined
in
the
first
great
cry
for
law
and
order
nor
are
they
all
joined
now
the
hands
of
a
part
of
mankind
have
ever
been
set
against
their
fellows
for
what
great
reason
no
man
can
tell
maybe
the
potter
marred
some
and
certainly
evil
circumstance
marred
some
but
by
good
hap
industry
has
always
and
intelligence
has
usually
been
on
the
law
side
ofttimes
however
the
ishmælites
raise
up
a
genius
and
he
spying
deep
sees
the
weak
places
in
the
law
and
the
open
holes
in
it
and
forces
through
to
the
great
hurt
of
his
fellows
and
men
standing
in
the
marvel
we
are
prone
to
forget
that
the
law
is
no
perfect
structure
that
it
is
simply
the
result
of
human
labor
and
human
genius
and
that
whatever
laws
human
ingenuity
can
create
for
the
protection
of
men
those
same
laws
human
ingenuity
can
evade
the
spirit
of
evil
is
no
dwarf
he
has
developed
equally
with
the
spirit
of
good
all
wrongs
are
not
crimes
indeed
only
those
wrongs
are
crimes
in
which
certain
technical
elements
are
present
the
law
provides
a
procrustean
standard
for
all
crimes
thus
a
wrong
to
become
criminal
must
fit
exactly
into
the
measure
laid
down
by
the
law
else
it
is
no
crime
if
it
varies
never
so
little
from
the
legal
measure
the
law
must
and
will
refuse
to
regard
it
as
criminal
no
matter
how
injurious
a
wrong
it
may
be
there
is
no
measure
of
morality
or
equity
or
common
right
that
can
be
applied
to
the
individual
case
the
gauge
of
the
law
is
the
wrong
measured
by
this
gauge
is
either
a
crime
or
it
is
not
there
is
no
middle
ground
hence
is
it
that
if
one
knows
well
the
technicalities
of
the
law
one
may
commit
horrible
wrongs
that
will
yield
all
the
gain
and
all
the
resulting
effect
of
the
highest
crimes
and
yet
the
wrongs
perpetrated
will
constitute
no
one
of
the
crimes
described
by
the
law
thus
the
highest
crimes
even
murder
may
be
committed
in
such
manner
that
although
the
criminal
is
known
and
the
law
holds
him
in
custody
yet
it
can
not
punish
him
so
it
happens
that
in
this
year
of
our
lord
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
skilful
attorney
marvels
at
the
stupidity
of
the
rogue
who
committing
crimes
by
the
ordinary
methods
subjects
himself
to
unnecessary
peril
when
the
result
which
he
seeks
can
easily
be
attained
by
other
methods
equally
expeditious
and
without
danger
of
liability
in
any
criminal
tribunal
this
is
the
field
into
which
the
author
has
ventured
and
he
believes
it
to
be
new
and
full
of
interest
in
order
to
develop
these
legal
problems
the
author
appreciated
the
need
for
a
central
figure
this
central
figure
must
of
necessity
be
a
lawyer
of
shrewdness
and
ability
here
a
grave
difficulty
presented
itself
no
attorney
unless
he
were
a
superlative
knave
could
be
presumed
to
suggest
the
committing
of
wrongs
entailing
grievous
injury
upon
innocent
men
on
the
other
hand
no
knave
vicious
enough
to
resort
to
such
wrongs
could
be
presumed
to
have
learning
enough
to
plan
them
else
he
would
not
be
driven
to
such
straits
hence
the
necessity
for
a
character
who
should
be
without
moral
sense
and
yet
should
possess
all
the
requisite
legal
acumen
such
a
character
is
randolph
mason
and
while
he
may
seem
strange
he
is
not
impossible
that
great
shocks
and
dread
maladies
may
lop
off
a
limb
of
the
human
mind
and
leave
the
other
portions
perfect
nay
may
even
wrench
the
human
soul
into
one
narrow
groove
is
the
common
lesson
of
the
clinic
and
the
an
intellect
keen
powerful
and
yet
devoid
of
any
sense
of
moral
obligation
would
be
no
passing
wonder
to
the
skilled
physician
for
no
one
knows
better
than
he
that
often
in
the
house
of
the
soul
there
are
great
chambers
locked
and
barred
and
whole
passages
sealed
up
in
the
dark
nor
do
men
marvel
that
great
minds
concentrated
on
some
mighty
labor
grow
utterly
oblivious
to
human
relations
and
see
and
care
for
naught
save
the
result
which
they
are
seeking
the
chemist
forgets
that
the
diamond
is
precious
and
burns
it
the
surgeon
forgets
that
his
patient
is
living
and
that
the
knife
hurts
as
it
cuts
might
not
the
great
lawyer
striving
tirelessly
with
the
problems
of
men
come
at
last
to
see
only
the
problem
with
the
people
in
it
as
pieces
on
a
it
may
be
objected
that
the
writer
has
prepared
here
a
for
the
shrewd
knave
to
this
it
is
answered
that
if
he
instructs
the
enemies
he
also
warns
the
friends
of
law
and
order
and
that
evil
has
never
yet
been
stronger
because
the
sun
shone
on
it
it
should
not
be
forgotten
that
this
book
deals
with
the
law
as
it
is
and
with
no
fanciful
interpretation
of
it
the
colors
are
woven
into
a
gray
warp
of
ancient
and
well
settled
legal
principles
obtaining
with
full
virtue
in
almost
every
state
the
formula
for
every
wrong
in
this
book
is
as
practical
as
the
plan
of
an
architect
and
may
be
played
out
by
any
skilful
villain
nor
should
it
be
presumed
that
the
instances
dealt
with
are
exhaustive
the
writer
has
presented
but
a
few
of
the
simpler
and
more
conspicuous
there
is
in
truth
many
another
indeed
the
wonder
grows
upon
him
that

thief
should

the

of
a

western
states
where

i
that
man
mason
said
samuel
walcott
is
the
mysterious
member
of
this
club
he
is
more
than
that
he
is
the
mysterious
man
of
new
york
i
was
much
surprised
to
see
him
answered
his
companion
marshall
clair
of
the
great
law
firm
of
seward
clair
de
muth
i
had
lost
track
of
him
since
he
went
to
paris
as
counsel
for
the
american
stockholders
of
the
canal
company
when
did
he
come
back
to
the
states
he
turned
up
suddenly
in
his
ancient
haunts
about
four
months
ago
said
walcott
as
grand
gloomy
and
peculiar
as
napoleon
ever
was
in
his
palmiest
days
the
younger
members
of
the
club
call
him
redivivus
he
wanders
through
the
house
usually
late
at
night
apparently
without
noticing
anything
or
anybody
his
mind
seems
to
be
deeply
and
busily
at
work
leaving
his
bodily
self
to
wander
as
it
may
happen
naturally
strange
stories
are
told
of
him
indeed
his
individuality
and
his
habit
of
doing
some
unexpected
thing
and
doing
it
in
such
a
marvellously
original
manner
that
men
who
are
experts
at
it
look
on
in
wonder
can
not
fail
to
make
him
an
object
of
interest
he
has
never
been
known
to
play
at
any
game
whatever
and
yet
one
night
he
sat
down
to
the
chess
table
with
old
admiral
du
brey
you
know
the
admiral
is
the
great
champion
since
he
beat
the
french
and
english
officers
in
the
tournament
last
winter
well
you
also
know
that
the
conventional
openings
at
chess
are
scientifically
and
accurately
determined
to
the
utter
disgust
of
du
brey
mason
opened
the
game
with
an
unheard
of
attack
from
the
extremes
of
the
board
the
old
admiral
stopped
and
in
a
kindly
patronizing
way
pointed
out
the
weak
and
absurd
folly
of
his
move
and
asked
him
to
begin
again
with
some
one
of
the
safe
openings
mason
smiled
and
answered
that
if
one
had
a
head
that
he
could
trust
he
should
use
it
if
not
then
it
was
the
part
of
wisdom
to
follow
blindly
the
dead
forms
of
some
man
who
had
a
head
du
brey
was
naturally
angry
and
set
himself
to
demolish
mason
as
quickly
as
possible
the
game
was
rapid
for
a
few
moments
mason
lost
piece
after
piece
his
opening
was
broken
and
destroyed
and
its
utter
folly
apparent
to
the
the
admiral
smiled
and
the
game
seemed
all
when
suddenly
to
his
utter
horror
du
brey
found
that
his
king
was
in
a
trap
the
foolish
opening
had
been
only
a
piece
of
shrewd
strategy
the
old
admiral
fought
and
cursed
and
sacrificed
his
pieces
but
it
was
of
no
use
he
was
gone
mason
checkmated
him
in
two
moves
and
arose
wearily
in
heaven
name
man
said
the
old
admiral
thunderstruck
you
learn
that
masterpiece
here
replied
mason
play
chess
one
should
know
his
opponent
how
could
the
dead
masters
lay
down
rules
by
which
you
could
be
beaten
sir
they
had
never
seen
you
and
thereupon
he
turned
and
left
the
room
of
course
clair
such
a
strange
man
would
soon
become
an
object
of
all
kinds
of
mysterious
rumors
some
are
true
and
some
are
not
at
any
rate
i
know
that
mason
is
an
unusual
man
with
a
gigantic
intellect
of
late
he
seems
to
have
taken
a
strange
fancy
to
me
in
fact
i
seem
to
be
the
only
member
of
the
club
that
he
will
talk
with
and
i
confess
that
he
startles
and
fascinates
me
he
is
an
original
genius
clair
of
an
unusual
order
i
recall
vividly
said
the
younger
man
that
before
mason
went
to
paris
he
was
considered
one
of
the
greatest
lawyers
of
this
city
and
he
was
feared
and
hated
by
the
bar
at
large
he
came
here
i
believe
from
virginia
and
began
with
the
criminal
practice
he
soon
became
famous
for
his
powerful
and
ingenious
defences
he
found
holes
in
the
law
through
which
his
clients
escaped
holes
that
by
the
profession
at
large
were
not
suspected
to
exist
and
that
frequently
astonished
the
judges
his
ability
caught
the
attention
of
the
great
corporations
they
tested
him
and
found
in
him
learning
and
unlimited
resources
he
pointed
out
methods
by
which
they
could
evade
obnoxious
statutes
by
which
they
could
comply
with
the
apparent
letter
of
the
law
and
yet
violate
its
spirit
and
advised
them
well
in
that
most
important
of
all
things
just
how
far
they
could
bend
the
law
without
breaking
it
at
the
time
he
left
for
paris
he
had
a
vast
clientage
and
was
in
the
midst
of
a
brilliant
career
the
day
he
took
passage
from
new
york
the
bar
lost
sight
of
him
no
matter
how
great
a
man
may
be
the
wave
soon
closes
over
him
in
a
city
like
this
in
a
few
years
mason
was
forgotten
now
only
the
older
practitioners
would
recall
him
and
they
would
do
so
with
hatred
and
bitterness
he
was
a
tireless
savage
uncompromising
fighter
always
a
recluse
well
said
walcott
he
reminds
me
of
a
great
cynic
transplanted
from
some
ancient
mysterious
empire
when
i
come
into
the
man
presence
i
feel
instinctively
the
grip
of
his
intellect
i
tell
you
clair
randolph
mason
is
the
mysterious
man
of
new
york
at
this
moment
a
messenger
boy
came
into
the
room
and
handed
walcott
a
telegram
clair
said
that
gentleman
rising
the
directors
of
the
elevated
are
in
session
and
we
must
hurry
the
two
men
put
on
their
coats
and
left
the
house
samuel
walcott
was
not
a
club
man
after
the
manner
of
the
smart
set
and
yet
he
was
in
fact
a
club
man
he
was
a
bachelor
in
the
latter
thirties
and
resided
in
a
great
silent
house
on
the
avenue
on
the
street
he
was
a
man
of
substance
shrewd
and
progressive
backed
by
great
wealth
he
had
various
corporate
interests
in
the
larger
syndicates
but
the
basis
and
foundation
of
his
fortune
was
real
estate
his
houses
on
the
avenue
were
the
best
possible
property
and
his
elevator
row
in
the
quarter
was
indeed
a
literal
gold
mine
it
was
known
that
many
years
before
his
grandfather
had
died
and
left
him
the
property
which
at
that
time
was
of
no
great
value
young
walcott
had
gone
out
into
the
and
had
been
lost
sight
of
and
forgotten
ten
years
afterward
he
had
turned
up
suddenly
in
new
york
and
taken
possession
of
his
property
then
vastly
increased
in
value
his
speculations
were
almost
phenomenally
successful
and
backed
by
the
now
enormous
value
of
his
real
property
he
was
soon
on
a
level
with
the
merchant
princes
his
judgment
was
considered
sound
and
he
had
the
full
confidence
of
his
business
associates
for
safety
and
caution
fortune
heaped
up
riches
around
him
with
a
lavish
hand
he
was
unmarried
and
the
halo
of
his
wealth
caught
the
keen
eye
of
the
matron
with
marriageable
daughters
he
was
invited
out
caught
by
the
whirl
of
society
and
tossed
into
its
maelstrom
in
a
measure
he
reciprocated
he
kept
horses
and
a
yacht
his
dinners
at
delmonico
and
the
club
were
above
reproach
but
with
all
he
was
a
silent
man
with
a
shadow
deep
in
his
eyes
and
seemed
to
court
the
society
of
his
fellows
not
because
he
loved
them
but
because
he
either
hated
or
feared
solitude
for
years
the
strategy
of
the
had
gone
gracefully
afield
but
fate
is
relentless
if
she
shields
the
victim
from
the
traps
of
men
it
is
not
because
she
wishes
him
to
escape
but
because
she
is
pleased
to
reserve
him
for
her
own
trap
so
it
happened
that
when
virginia
clair
assisted
miriam
steuvisant
at
her
midwinter
reception
this
same
samuel
walcott
fell
deeply
and
hopelessly
and
utterly
in
love
and
it
was
so
apparent
to
the
beaten
generals
present
that
miriam
steuvisant
applauded
herself
so
to
speak
with
encore
after
encore
it
was
good
to
see
this
courteous
silent
man
literally
at
the
feet
of
the
young
debutante
he
was
there
of
right
even
the
mothers
of
marriageable
daughters
admitted
that
the
young
girl
was
and
tall
enough
said
the
experts
and
of
the
blue
blood
royal
with
all
the
grace
courtesy
and
inbred
genius
of
such
princely
heritage
perhaps
it
was
objected
by
the
censors
of
the
smart
set
that
miss
clair
frankness
and
honesty
were
a
trifle
and
that
she
was
a
shadowy
bit
of
a
puritan
and
perhaps
it
was
of
these
same
qualities
that
samuel
walcott
received
his
hurt
at
any
rate
the
hurt
was
there
and
deep
and
the
new
actor
stepped
up
into
the
old
drama
and
began
his
rôle
with
a
tireless
utter
sincerity
that
was
deadly
dangerous
if
he
lost
ii
perhaps
a
week
after
the
conversation
between
clair
and
walcott
randolph
mason
stood
in
the
private
of
the
club
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
he
was
a
man
apparently
in
the
middle
forties
tall
and
reasonably
broad
across
the
shoulders
muscular
without
being
either
stout
or
lean
his
hair
was
thin
and
of
a
brown
color
with
erratic
streaks
of
gray
his
forehead
was
broad
and
high
and
of
a
faint
reddish
color
his
eyes
were
restless
inky
black
and
not
the
nose
was
big
and
muscular
and
bowed
the
eyebrows
were
black
and
heavy
almost
bushy
there
were
heavy
furrows
running
from
the
nose
downward
and
outward
to
the
corners
of
the
mouth
the
mouth
was
straight
and
the
jaw
was
heavy
and
square
looking
at
the
face
of
randolph
mason
from
above
the
expression
in
repose
was
crafty
and
cynical
viewed
from
below
upward
it
was
savage
and
vindictive
almost
brutal
while
from
the
front
if
looked
squarely
in
the
face
the
stranger
was
fascinated
by
the
animation
of
the
man
and
at
once
concluded
that
his
expression
was
fearless
and
sneering
he
was
evidently
of
southern
extraction
and
a
man
of
unusual
power
a
fire
smouldered
on
the
hearth
it
was
a
crisp
evening
in
the
early
fall
and
with
that
touch
of
melancholy
which
ever
heralds
the
coming
winter
even
in
the
midst
of
a
city
the
man
face
looked
tired
and
ugly
his
long
white
hands
were
clasped
tight
together
his
entire
figure
and
face
wore
every
mark
of
weakness
and
physical
exhaustion
but
his
eyes
contradicted
they
were
red
and
restless
in
the
private
the
dinner
party
was
in
the
best
of
spirits
samuel
walcott
was
happy
across
the
table
from
him
was
miss
virginia
clair
radiant
a
tinge
of
color
in
her
cheeks
on
either
side
miriam
steuvisant
and
marshall
clair
were
brilliant
and
walcott
looked
at
the
young
girl
and
the
measure
of
his
worship
was
full
he
wondered
for
the
thousandth
time
how
she
could
possibly
love
him
and
by
what
earthly
miracle
she
had
come
to
accept
him
and
how
it
would
be
always
to
have
her
across
the
table
from
him
his
own
table
in
his
own
house
they
were
about
to
rise
from
the
table
when
one
of
the
waiters
entered
the
room
and
handed
walcott
an
envelope
he
thrust
it
quickly
into
his
pocket
in
the
confusion
of
rising
the
others
did
not
notice
him
but
his
face
was
and
his
hands
trembled
violently
as
he
placed
the
wraps
around
the
bewitching
shoulders
of
miss
clair
marshall
he
said
and
despite
the
powerful
effort
his
voice
was
hollow
you
will
see
the
ladies
safely
cared
for
i
am
called
to
attend
a
grave
matter
all
right
walcott
answered
the
young
man
with
cheery
you
are
too
serious
old
man
trot
along
the
poor
dear
murmured
steuvisant
after
walcott
had
helped
them
to
the
carriage
and
turned
to
go
up
the
steps
of
the
club
the
poor
dear
is
hard
hit
and
men
are
such
funny
creatures
when
they
are
hard
hit
samuel
walcott
as
his
fate
would
went
direct
to
the
private
and
opened
the
door
the
lights
were
not
turned
on
and
in
the
dark
he
did
not
see
mason
motionless
by
the
he
went
quickly
across
the
room
to
the
turned
on
one
of
the
lights
and
taking
the
envelope
from
his
pocket
tore
it
open
then
he
bent
down
by
the
light
to
read
the
contents
as
his
eyes
ran
over
the
paper
his
jaw
fell
the
skin
drew
away
from
his
and
his
face
seemed
literally
to
sink
in
his
knees
gave
way
under
him
and
he
would
have
gone
down
in
a
heap
had
it
not
been
for
mason
long
arms
that
closed
around
him
and
held
him
up
the
human
economy
is
ever
mysterious
the
moment
the
new
danger
threatened
the
latent
power
of
the
man
as
an
animal
hidden
away
in
the
centres
of
intelligence
asserted
itself
his
hand
clutched
the
paper
and
with
a
half
slide
he
turned
in
mason
arms
for
a
moment
he
stared
up
at
the
ugly
man
whose
thin
arms
felt
like
wire
ropes
you
are
under
the
aye
said
mason
the
cunning
of
my
enemy
is
sublime
your
enemy
gasped
walcott
when
did
you
come
into
it
how
in
name
did
you
know
it
how
your
enemy
mason
looked
down
at
the
wide
bulging
eyes
of
the
man
who
should
know
better
than
i
he
said
have
i
broken
through
all
the
traps
and
plots
that
she
could
set
she
she
trap
you
the
man
voice
was
full
of
horror
the
old
schemer
muttered
mason
the
cowardly
old
schemer
to
strike
in
the
back
but
we
can
beat
her
she
did
not
count
on
my
helping
you
i
who
know
her
so
well
mason
face
was
red
and
his
eyes
burned
in
the
midst
of
it
all
he
dropped
his
hands
and
went
over
to
the
fire
samuel
walcott
arose
panting
and
stood
looking
at
mason
with
his
hands
behind
him
on
the
table
the
naturally
strong
nature
and
the
rigid
school
in
which
the
man
had
been
trained
presently
began
to
tell
his
composure
in
part
returned
and
he
thought
rapidly
what
did
this
strange
man
know
was
he
simply
making
shrewd
guesses
or
had
he
some
mysterious
knowledge
of
this
matter
walcott
could
not
know
that
mason
meant
only
fate
that
he
believed
her
to
be
his
great
enemy
walcott
had
never
before
doubted
his
own
ability
to
meet
any
emergency
this
mighty
jerk
had
carried
him
off
his
feet
he
was
unstrung
and
at
any
rate
this
man
had
promised
help
he
would
take
it
he
put
the
paper
and
envelope
carefully
into
his
pocket
smoothed
out
his
rumpled
coat
and
going
over
to
mason
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
come
he
said
if
you
are
to
help
me
we
must
go
the
man
turned
and
followed
him
without
a
word
in
the
hall
mason
put
on
his
hat
and
overcoat
and
the
two
went
out
into
the
street
walcott
hailed
a
cab
and
the
two
were
driven
to
his
house
on
the
avenue
walcott
took
out
his
opened
the
door
and
led
the
way
into
the
library
he
turned
on
the
light
and
motioned
mason
to
seat
himself
at
the
table
then
he
went
into
another
room
and
presently
returned
with
a
bundle
of
papers
and
a
decanter
of
brandy
he
poured
out
a
glass
of
the
liquor
and
offered
it
to
mason
the
man
shook
his
head
walcott
poured
the
contents
of
the
glass
down
his
own
throat
then
he
set
the
decanter
down
and
drew
up
a
chair
on
the
side
of
the
table
opposite
mason
sir
said
walcott
in
a
voice
deliberate
indeed
but
as
hollow
as
a
sepulchre
i
am
done
for
god
has
finally
gathered
up
the
ends
of
the
net
and
it
is
knotted
tight
am
i
not
here
to
help
you
said
mason
turning
savagely
i
can
beat
fate
give
me
the
details
of
her
trap
he
bent
forward
and
rested
his
arms
on
the
table
his
streaked
gray
hair
was
rumpled
and
on
end
and
his
face
was
ugly
for
a
moment
walcott
did
not
answer
he
moved
a
little
into
the
shadow
then
he
spread
the
bundle
of
old
yellow
papers
out
before
him
to
begin
with
he
said
i
am
a
living
lie
a
gilded
sham
every
bit
of
me
there
is
not
an
honest
piece
anywhere
it
is
all
lie
i
am
a
liar
and
a
thief
before
men
the
property
which
i
possess
is
not
mine
but
stolen
from
a
dead
man
the
very
name
which
i
bear
is
not
my
own
but
is
the
bastard
child
of
a
crime
i
am
more
than
all
that
i
am
a
murderer
a
murderer
before
the
law
a
murderer
before
god
and
worse
than
a
murderer
before
the
pure
woman
whom
i
love
more
than
anything
that
god
could
make
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
face
sir
said
mason
this
is
all
drivel
infantile
drivel
what
you
are
is
of
no
importance
how
to
get
out
is
the
problem
how
to
get
out
samuel
walcott
leaned
forward
poured
out
a
glass
of
brandy
and
swallowed
it
well
he
said
speaking
slowly
my
right
name
is
richard
warren
in
the
spring
of
i
came
to
new
york
and
fell
in
with
the
real
samuel
walcott
a
young
man
with
a
little
money
and
some
property
which
his
grandfather
had
left
him
we
became
friends
and
concluded
to
go
to
the
far
west
together
accordingly
we
scraped
together
what
money
we
could
lay
our
hands
on
and
landed
in
the
regions
of
california
we
were
young
and
inexperienced
and
our
money
went
rapidly
one
april
morning
we
drifted
into
a
little
shack
camp
away
up
in
the
sierra
nevadas
called
hell
elbow
here
we
struggled
and
starved
for
perhaps
a
year
finally
in
utter
desperation
walcott
married
the
daughter
of
a
mexican
gambler
who
ran
an
and
a
poker
joint
with
them
we
lived
from
hand
to
mouth
in
a
wild
way
for
several
years
after
a
time
the
woman
began
to
take
a
strange
fancy
to
me
walcott
finally
noticed
it
and
grew
jealous
one
night
in
a
drunken
brawl
we
quarrelled
and
i
killed
him
it
was
late
at
night
and
beside
the
woman
there
were
four
of
us
in
the
poker
room
the
mexican
gambler
a
devil
called
cherubim
pete
walcott
and
myself
when
walcott
fell
the
whipped
out
his
weapon
and
fired
at
me
across
the
table
but
the
woman
nina
san
croix
struck
his
arm
and
instead
of
killing
me
as
he
intended
the
bullet
mortally
wounded
her
father
the
mexican
gambler
i
shot
the
through
the
forehead
and
turned
round
expecting
the
woman
to
attack
me
on
the
contrary
she
pointed
to
the
window
and
bade
me
wait
for
her
on
the
below
it
was
fully
three
hours
later
before
the
woman
joined
me
at
the
place
indicated
she
had
a
bag
of
gold
dust
a
few
jewels
that
belonged
to
her
father
and
a
package
of
papers
i
asked
her
why
she
had
stayed
behind
so
long
and
she
replied
that
the
men
were
not
killed
outright
and
that
she
had
brought
a
priest
to
them
and
waited
until
they
had
died
this
was
the
truth
but
not
all
the
truth
moved
by
superstition
or
foresight
the
woman
had
induced
the
priest
to
take
down
the
sworn
statements
of
the
two
dying
men
seal
it
and
give
it
to
her
this
paper
she
brought
with
her
all
this
i
learned
afterwards
at
the
time
i
knew
nothing
of
this
damning
evidence
we
struck
out
together
for
the
pacific
coast
the
country
was
lawless
the
privations
we
endured
were
almost
past
belief
at
times
the
woman
exhibited
cunning
and
ability
that
were
almost
genius
and
through
it
all
often
in
the
very
fingers
of
death
her
devotion
to
me
never
wavered
it
was
and
seemed
to
be
her
only
object
on
earth
when
we
reached
san
francisco
the
woman
put
these
papers
into
my
hands
walcott
took
up
the
yellow
package
and
pushed
it
across
the
table
to
mason
she
proposed
that
i
assume
walcott
name
and
that
we
come
boldly
to
new
york
and
claim
the
property
i
examined
the
papers
found
a
copy
of
the
will
by
which
walcott
inherited
the
property
a
bundle
of
correspondence
and
sufficient
documentary
evidence
to
establish
his
identity
beyond
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
desperate
gambler
as
i
now
was
i
quailed
before
the
daring
plan
of
nina
san
croix
i
urged
that
i
richard
warren
would
be
known
that
the
attempted
fraud
would
be
detected
and
would
result
in
investigation
and
perhaps
unearth
the
whole
horrible
matter
the
woman
pointed
out
how
much
i
resembled
walcott
what
vast
changes
ten
years
of
such
life
as
we
had
led
would
naturally
be
expected
to
make
in
men
how
utterly
impossible
it
would
be
to
trace
back
the
fraud
to
walcott
murder
at
hell
elbow
in
the
wild
passes
of
the
sierra
nevadas
she
bade
me
remember
that
we
were
both
outcasts
both
both
enemies
of
man
law
and
god
that
we
had
nothing
to
lose
we
were
both
sunk
to
the
bottom
then
she
laughed
and
said
that
she
had
not
found
me
a
coward
until
now
but
that
if
i
had
turned
that
was
the
end
of
it
of
course
the
result
was
we
sold
the
gold
dust
and
jewels
in
san
francisco
took
on
such
evidences
of
civilization
as
possible
and
purchased
passage
to
new
york
on
the
best
steamer
we
could
find
i
was
growing
to
depend
on
the
bold
gambler
spirit
of
this
woman
nina
san
croix
i
felt
the
need
of
her
strong
profligate
nature
she
was
of
a
queer
breed
and
a
queerer
school
her
mother
was
the
daughter
of
a
spanish
engineer
and
had
been
stolen
by
the
mexican
her
father
she
herself
had
been
raised
and
educated
as
best
might
be
in
one
of
the
monasteries
along
the
rio
grande
and
had
there
grown
to
womanhood
before
her
father
fleeing
into
the
mountains
of
california
carried
her
with
him
when
we
landed
in
new
york
i
offered
to
announce
her
as
my
wife
but
she
refused
saying
that
her
presence
would
excite
comment
and
perhaps
attract
the
attention
of
walcott
relatives
we
therefore
arranged
that
i
should
go
alone
into
the
city
claim
the
property
and
announce
myself
as
samuel
walcott
and
that
she
should
remain
under
cover
until
such
time
as
we
would
feel
the
ground
safe
under
us
every
detail
of
the
plan
was
fatally
successful
i
established
my
identity
without
difficulty
and
secured
the
property
it
had
increased
vastly
in
value
and
i
as
samuel
walcott
soon
found
myself
a
rich
man
i
went
to
nina
san
croix
in
hiding
and
gave
her
a
large
sum
of
money
with
which
she
purchased
a
residence
in
a
retired
part
of
the
city
far
up
in
the
northern
suburb
here
she
lived
secluded
and
unknown
while
i
remained
in
the
city
living
here
as
a
wealthy
bachelor
i
did
not
attempt
to
abandon
the
woman
but
went
to
her
from
time
to
time
in
disguise
and
under
cover
of
the
greatest
secrecy
for
a
time
everything
ran
smooth
the
woman
was
still
devoted
to
me
above
everything
else
and
thought
always
of
my
welfare
first
and
seemed
content
to
wait
so
long
as
i
thought
best
my
business
expanded
i
was
sought
after
and
consulted
and
drawn
into
the
higher
life
of
new
york
and
more
and
more
felt
that
the
woman
was
an
albatross
on
my
neck
i
put
her
off
with
one
excuse
after
another
finally
she
began
to
suspect
me
and
demanded
that
i
should
recognize
her
as
my
wife
i
attempted
to
point
out
the
difficulties
she
met
them
all
by
saying
that
we
should
both
go
to
spain
there
i
could
marry
her
and
we
could
return
to
america
and
drop
into
my
place
in
society
without
causing
more
than
a
passing
comment
i
concluded
to
meet
the
matter
squarely
once
for
all
i
said
that
i
would
convert
half
of
the
property
into
money
and
give
it
to
her
but
that
i
would
not
marry
her
she
did
not
fly
into
a
storming
rage
as
i
had
expected
but
went
quietly
out
of
the
room
and
presently
returned
with
two
papers
which
she
read
one
was
the
certificate
of
her
marriage
to
walcott
duly
authenticated
the
other
was
the
dying
statement
of
her
father
the
mexican
gambler
and
of
samuel
walcott
charging
me
with
murder
it
was
in
proper
form
and
certified
by
the
jesuit
priest
now
she
said
sweetly
when
she
had
finished
do
you
prefer
to
recognize
your
wife
or
to
turn
all
the
property
over
to
samuel
walcott
widow
and
hang
for
his
murder
i
was
dumbfounded
and
horrified
i
saw
the
trap
that
i
was
in
and
i
consented
to
do
anything
she
should
say
if
she
would
only
destroy
the
papers
this
she
refused
to
do
i
pleaded
with
her
and
implored
her
to
destroy
them
finally
she
gave
them
to
me
with
a
great
show
of
returning
confidence
and
i
tore
them
into
bits
and
threw
them
into
the
fire
that
was
three
months
ago
we
arranged
to
go
to
spain
and
do
as
she
said
she
was
to
sail
this
morning
and
i
was
to
follow
of
course
i
never
intended
to
go
i
congratulated
myself
on
the
fact
that
all
trace
of
evidence
against
me
was
destroyed
and
that
her
grip
was
now
broken
my
plan
was
to
induce
her
to
sail
believing
that
i
would
follow
when
she
was
gone
i
would
marry
miss
clair
and
if
nina
san
croix
should
return
i
would
defy
her
and
lock
her
up
as
a
lunatic
but
i
was
reckoning
like
an
infernal
ass
to
imagine
for
a
moment
that
i
could
thus
hoodwink
such
a
woman
as
nina
san
croix
i
received
this
walcott
took
the
envelope
from
his
pocket
and
gave
it
to
mason
you
saw
the
effect
of
it
read
it
and
you
will
understand
why
i
felt
the
death
hand
when
i
saw
her
writing
on
the
envelope
mason
took
the
paper
from
the
envelope
it
was
written
in
spanish
and
ran
greeting
to
richard
warren
the
great
senor
does
his
little
nina
injustice
to
think
she
would
go
away
to
spain
and
leave
him
to
the
beautiful
american
she
is
not
so
thoughtless
before
she
goes
she
shall
be
oh
so
very
rich
and
the
dear
senor
shall
be
oh
so
very
safe
the
archbishop
and
the
kind
church
hate
murderers
nina
san
croix
of
course
fool
the
papers
you
destroyed
were
copies
san
to
this
was
pinned
a
line
in
a
delicate
aristocratic
hand
saying
that
the
archbishop
would
willingly
listen
to
madam
san
croix
statement
if
she
would
come
to
him
on
friday
morning
at
eleven
you
see
said
walcott
desperately
there
is
no
possible
way
out
i
know
the
woman
when
she
decides
to
do
a
thing
that
is
the
end
of
it
she
has
decided
to
do
this
mason
turned
around
from
the
table
stretched
out
his
long
legs
and
thrust
his
hands
deep
into
his
pockets
walcott
sat
with
his
head
down
watching
mason
hopelessly
almost
indifferently
his
face
blank
and
sunken
the
ticking
of
the
bronze
clock
on
the
was
loud
painfully
loud
suddenly
mason
drew
his
knees
in
and
bent
over
put
both
his
bony
hands
on
the
table
and
looked
at
walcott
sir
he
said
this
matter
is
in
such
shape
that
there
is
only
one
thing
to
do
this
growth
must
be
cut
out
at
the
roots
and
cut
out
quickly
this
is
the
first
fact
to
be
determined
and
a
fool
would
know
it
the
second
fact
is
that
you
must
do
it
yourself
hired
killers
are
like
the
grave
and
the
daughters
of
the
they
cry
always
give
they
are
only
palliatives
not
cures
by
using
them
you
swap
perils
you
simply
take
a
stay
of
execution
at
best
the
common
criminal
would
know
this
these
are
the
facts
of
your
problem
the
master
plotters
of
crime
would
see
here
but
two
difficulties
to
meet
a
practical
method
for
accomplishing
the
body
of
the
crime
a
cover
for
the
criminal
agent
they
would
see
no
farther
and
attempt
to
guard
no
farther
after
they
had
provided
a
plan
for
the
killing
and
a
means
by
which
the
killer
could
cover
his
trail
and
escape
from
the
theatre
of
the
homicide
they
would
believe
all
the
requirements
of
the
problems
met
and
would
stop
the
greatest
the
very
giants
among
them
have
stopped
here
and
have
been
in
great
error
in
every
crime
especially
in
the
great
ones
there
exists
a
third
element
vital
this
third
element
the
master
plotters
have
either
overlooked
or
else
have
not
had
the
genius
to
construct
they
plan
with
rare
cunning
to
baffle
the
victim
they
plan
with
vast
wisdom
almost
genius
to
baffle
the
trailer
but
they
fail
utterly
to
provide
any
plan
for
baffling
the
punisher
ergo
their
plots
are
fatally
defective
and
often
result
in
ruin
hence
the
vital
necessity
for
providing
the
third
element
the
ipso
mason
arose
walked
around
the
table
and
put
his
hand
firmly
on
samuel
walcott
shoulder
this
must
be
done
night
he
continued
you
must
arrange
your
business
matters
and
announce
that
you
are
going
on
a
yacht
cruise
by
order
of
your
physician
and
may
not
return
for
some
weeks
you
must
prepare
your
yacht
for
a
voyage
instruct
your
men
to
touch
at
a
certain
point
on
staten
island
and
wait
until
six
day
after
morning
if
you
do
not
come
aboard
by
that
time
they
are
to
go
to
one
of
the
south
american
ports
and
remain
until
further
orders
by
this
means
your
absence
for
an
indefinite
period
will
be
explained
you
will
go
to
nina
san
croix
in
the
disguise
which
you
have
always
used
and
from
her
to
the
yacht
and
by
this
means
step
out
of
your
real
status
and
back
into
it
without
leaving
traces
i
will
come
here
evening
and
furnish
you
with
everything
that
you
shall
need
and
give
you
full
and
exact
instructions
in
every
particular
these
details
you
must
execute
with
the
greatest
care
as
they
will
be
vitally
essential
to
the
success
of
my
plan
through
it
all
walcott
had
been
silent
and
motionless
now
he
arose
and
in
his
face
there
must
have
been
some
premonition
of
protest
for
mason
stepped
back
and
put
out
his
hand
sir
he
said
with
brutal
emphasis
not
a
word
remember
that
you
are
only
the
hand
and
the
hand
does
not
think
then
he
turned
around
abruptly
and
went
out
of
the
house
iii
the
place
which
samuel
walcott
had
selected
for
the
residence
of
nina
san
croix
was
far
up
in
the
northern
suburb
of
new
york
the
place
was
very
old
the
lawn
was
large
and
the
house
a
square
brick
was
set
far
back
from
the
street
and
partly
hidden
by
trees
around
it
all
was
a
rusty
iron
fence
the
place
had
the
air
of
genteel
ruin
such
as
one
finds
in
the
virginias
on
a
thursday
of
november
about
three
in
the
afternoon
a
little
man
driving
a
dray
stopped
in
the
alley
at
the
rear
of
the
house
as
he
opened
the
back
gate
an
old
negro
woman
came
down
the
steps
from
the
kitchen
and
demanded
to
know
what
he
wanted
the
drayman
asked
if
the
lady
of
the
house
was
in
the
old
negro
answered
that
she
was
asleep
at
this
hour
and
could
not
be
seen
that
is
good
said
the
little
man
now
there
wo
be
any
row
i
brought
up
some
cases
of
wine
which
she
ordered
from
our
house
last
week
and
which
the
boss
told
me
to
deliver
at
once
but
i
forgot
it
until
just
let
me
put
it
in
the
cellar
now
auntie
and
do
say
a
word
to
the
lady
about
it
and
she
wo
ever
know
that
it
was
not
brought
up
on
time
the
drayman
stopped
fished
a
silver
dollar
out
of
his
pocket
and
gave
it
to
the
old
negro
there
now
auntie
he
said
my
job
depends
upon
the
lady
not
knowing
about
this
wine
keep
it
mum
dat
all
right
honey
said
the
old
servant
beaming
like
a
may
morning
de
cellar
door
is
open
carry
it
all
in
and
put
it
in
de
back
part
and
nobody
aint
never
going
to
know
how
long
it
has
been
in
the
old
negro
went
back
into
the
kitchen
and
the
little
man
began
to
unload
the
dray
he
carried
in
five
wine
cases
and
stowed
them
away
in
the
back
part
of
the
cellar
as
the
old
woman
had
directed
then
after
having
satisfied
himself
that
no
one
was
watching
he
took
from
the
dray
two
heavy
paper
sacks
presumably
filled
with
flour
and
a
little
bundle
wrapped
in
an
old
newspaper
these
he
carefully
hid
behind
the
wine
cases
in
the
cellar
after
a
while
he
closed
the
door
climbed
on
his
dray
and
drove
off
down
the
alley
about
eight
in
the
evening
of
the
same
day
a
mexican
sailor
dodged
in
the
front
gate
and
slipped
down
to
the
side
of
the
house
he
stopped
by
the
window
and
tapped
on
it
with
his
finger
in
a
moment
a
woman
opened
the
door
she
was
tall
lithe
and
splendidly
proportioned
with
a
dark
spanish
face
and
straight
hair
the
man
stepped
inside
the
woman
bolted
the
door
and
turned
round
ah
she
said
smiling
it
is
you
senor
how
good
of
you
the
man
started
whom
else
did
you
expect
he
said
quickly
oh
laughed
the
woman
perhaps
the
archbishop
nina
said
the
man
in
a
broken
voice
that
expressed
love
humility
and
reproach
his
face
was
white
under
the
black
sunburn
for
a
moment
the
woman
wavered
a
shadow
flitted
over
her
eyes
then
she
stepped
back
no
she
said
not
yet
the
man
walked
across
to
the
fire
sank
down
in
a
chair
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
the
woman
stepped
up
noiselessly
behind
him
and
leaned
over
the
chair
the
man
was
either
in
great
agony
or
else
he
was
a
superb
actor
for
the
muscles
of
his
neck
twitched
violently
and
his
shoulders
trembled
oh
he
muttered
as
though
echoing
his
thoughts
i
ca
do
it
i
ca
the
woman
caught
the
words
and
leaped
up
as
though
some
one
had
struck
her
in
the
face
she
threw
back
her
head
her
nostrils
dilated
and
her
eyes
flashed
you
ca
do
it
she
cried
then
you
do
love
her
you
shall
do
it
do
you
hear
me
you
shall
do
it
you
killed
him
you
got
rid
of
him
but
you
shall
not
get
rid
of
me
i
have
the
evidence
all
of
it
the
archbishop
will
have
it
they
shall
hang
you
do
you
hear
me
they
shall
hang
you
the
woman
voice
rose
it
was
loud
and
shrill
the
man
turned
slowly
round
without
looking
up
and
stretched
out
his
arms
toward
the
woman
she
stopped
and
looked
down
at
him
the
fire
glittered
for
a
moment
and
then
died
out
of
her
eyes
her
bosom
heaved
and
her
lips
began
to
tremble
with
a
cry
she
flung
herself
into
his
arms
caught
him
around
the
neck
and
pressed
his
face
up
close
against
her
cheek
oh
dick
dick
she
sobbed
i
do
love
you
so
i
ca
live
without
you
not
another
hour
dick
i
do
want
you
so
much
so
much
dick
the
man
shifted
his
right
arm
quickly
slipped
a
great
mexican
knife
out
of
his
sleeve
and
passed
his
fingers
slowly
up
the
woman
side
until
he
felt
the
heart
beat
under
his
hand
then
he
raised
the
knife
gripped
the
handle
tight
and
drove
the
keen
blade
into
the
woman
bosom
the
hot
blood
gushed
out
over
his
arm
and
down
on
his
leg
the
body
warm
and
limp
slipped
down
in
his
arms
the
man
got
up
pulled
out
the
knife
and
thrust
it
into
a
sheath
at
his
belt
unbuttoned
the
dress
and
slipped
it
off
of
the
body
as
he
did
this
a
bundle
of
papers
dropped
upon
the
floor
these
he
glanced
at
hastily
and
put
into
his
pocket
then
he
took
the
dead
woman
up
in
his
arms
went
out
into
the
hall
and
started
to
go
up
the
stairway
the
body
was
relaxed
and
heavy
and
for
that
reason
difficult
to
carry
he
doubled
it
up
into
an
awful
heap
with
the
knees
against
the
chin
and
walked
slowly
and
heavily
up
the
stairs
and
out
into
the
there
he
laid
the
corpse
down
on
the
tiled
floor
then
he
opened
the
window
closed
the
shutters
and
lighted
the
gas
the
was
small
and
contained
an
ordinary
steel
tub
standing
near
the
window
and
raised
about
six
inches
above
the
floor
the
sailor
went
over
to
the
tub
pried
up
the
metal
rim
of
the
outlet
with
his
knife
removed
it
and
fitted
into
its
place
a
porcelain
disk
which
he
took
from
his
pocket
to
this
disk
was
attached
a
long
platinum
wire
the
end
of
which
he
fastened
on
the
outside
of
the
tub
after
he
had
done
this
he
went
back
to
the
body
stripped
off
its
clothing
put
it
down
in
the
tub
and
began
to
dismember
it
with
the
great
mexican
knife
the
blade
was
strong
and
sharp
as
a
razor
the
man
worked
rapidly
and
with
the
greatest
care
when
he
had
finally
cut
the
body
into
as
small
pieces
as
possible
he
replaced
the
knife
in
its
sheath
washed
his
hands
and
went
out
of
the
and
down
stairs
to
the
lower
hall
the
sailor
seemed
perfectly
familiar
with
the
house
by
a
side
door
he
passed
into
the
cellar
there
he
lighted
the
gas
opened
one
of
the
wine
cases
and
taking
up
all
the
bottles
that
he
could
conveniently
carry
returned
to
the
there
he
poured
the
contents
into
the
tub
on
the
dismembered
body
and
then
returned
to
the
cellar
with
the
empty
bottles
which
he
replaced
in
the
wine
cases
this
he
continued
to
do
until
all
the
cases
but
one
were
emptied
and
the
bath
tub
was
more
than
half
full
of
liquid
this
liquid
was
sulphuric
acid
when
the
sailor
returned
to
the
cellar
with
the
last
empty
wine
bottles
he
opened
the
fifth
case
which
really
contained
wine
took
some
of
it
out
and
poured
a
little
into
each
of
the
empty
bottles
in
order
to
remove
any
possible
odor
of
the
sulphuric
acid
then
he
turned
out
the
gas
and
brought
up
to
the
with
him
the
two
paper
flour
sacks
and
the
little
heavy
bundle
these
sacks
were
filled
with
nitrate
of
soda
he
set
them
down
by
the
door
opened
the
little
bundle
and
took
out
two
long
rubber
tubes
each
attached
to
a
heavy
gas
burner
not
unlike
the
ordinary
burners
of
a
small
he
fastened
the
tubes
to
two
of
the
gas
jets
put
the
burners
under
the
tub
turned
the
gas
on
full
and
lighted
it
then
he
threw
into
the
tub
the
woman
clothing
and
the
papers
which
he
had
found
on
her
body
after
which
he
took
up
the
two
heavy
sacks
of
nitrate
of
soda
and
dropped
them
carefully
into
the
sulphuric
acid
when
he
had
done
this
he
went
quickly
out
of
the
and
closed
the
door
the
deadly
acids
at
once
attacked
the
body
and
began
to
destroy
it
as
the
heat
increased
the
acids
boiled
and
the
destructive
process
was
rapid
and
awful
from
time
to
time
the
sailor
opened
the
door
of
the
cautiously
and
holding
a
wet
towel
over
his
mouth
and
nose
looked
in
at
his
horrible
work
at
the
end
of
a
few
hours
there
was
only
a
swimming
mass
in
the
tub
when
the
man
looked
at
four
it
was
all
a
thick
murky
liquid
he
turned
off
the
gas
quickly
and
stepped
back
out
of
the
room
for
perhaps
half
an
hour
he
waited
in
the
hall
finally
when
the
acids
had
cooled
so
that
they
no
longer
gave
off
fumes
he
opened
the
door
and
went
in
took
hold
of
the
platinum
wire
and
pulling
the
porcelain
disk
from
the
allowed
the
awful
contents
of
the
tub
to
run
out
then
he
turned
on
the
hot
water
rinsed
the
tub
clean
and
replaced
the
metal
outlet
removing
the
rubber
tubes
he
cut
them
into
pieces
broke
the
porcelain
disk
and
rolling
up
the
platinum
wire
washed
it
all
down
the
sewer
pipe
the
fumes
had
escaped
through
the
open
window
this
he
now
closed
and
set
himself
to
putting
the
in
order
and
effectually
removing
every
trace
of
his
night
work
the
sailor
moved
around
with
the
very
greatest
degree
of
care
finally
when
he
had
arranged
everything
to
his
complete
satisfaction
he
picked
up
the
two
burners
turned
out
the
gas
and
left
the
closing
the
door
after
him
from
the
he
went
directly
to
the
attic
concealed
the
two
rusty
burners
under
a
heap
of
rubbish
and
then
walked
carefully
and
noiselessly
down
the
stairs
and
through
the
lower
hall
as
he
opened
the
door
and
stepped
into
the
room
where
he
had
killed
the
woman
two
sprang
out
and
seized
him
the
man
screamed
like
a
wild
beast
taken
in
a
trap
and
sank
down
oh
oh
he
cried
it
was
no
use
it
was
no
use
to
do
it
then
he
recovered
himself
in
a
manner
and
was
silent
the
officers
handcuffed
him
summoned
the
patrol
and
took
him
at
once
to
the
there
he
said
he
was
a
mexican
sailor
and
that
his
name
was
victor
ancona
but
he
would
say
nothing
further
the
following
morning
he
sent
for
randolph
mason
and
the
two
were
long
together
iv
the
obscure
defendant
charged
with
murder
has
little
reason
to
complain
of
the
law
delays
the
morning
following
the
arrest
of
victor
ancona
the
newspapers
published
long
sensational
articles
denounced
him
as
a
fiend
and
convicted
him
the
grand
jury
as
it
happened
was
in
session
the
preliminaries
were
soon
arranged
and
the
case
was
railroaded
into
trial
the
indictment
contained
a
great
many
counts
and
charged
the
prisoner
with
the
murder
of
nina
san
croix
by
striking
stabbing
choking
poisoning
and
so
forth
the
trial
had
continued
for
three
days
and
had
appeared
so
overwhelmingly
that
the
spectators
who
were
crowded
in
the
had
grown
to
be
violent
and
bitter
partisans
to
such
an
extent
that
the
police
watched
them
closely
the
attorneys
for
the
people
were
dramatic
and
denunciatory
and
forced
their
case
with
arrogant
confidence
mason
as
counsel
for
the
prisoner
was
indifferent
and
listless
throughout
the
entire
trial
he
had
sat
almost
motionless
at
the
table
his
gaunt
form
bent
over
his
long
legs
drawn
up
under
his
chair
and
his
weary
face
with
its
restless
eyes
fixed
and
staring
out
over
the
heads
of
the
jury
was
like
a
tragic
mask
the
bar
and
even
the
judge
believed
that
the
prisoner
counsel
had
abandoned
his
case
the
evidence
was
all
in
and
the
people
rested
it
had
been
shown
that
nina
san
croix
had
resided
for
many
years
in
the
house
in
which
the
prisoner
was
arrested
that
she
had
lived
by
herself
with
no
other
companion
than
an
old
negro
servant
that
her
past
was
unknown
and
that
she
received
no
visitors
save
the
mexican
sailor
who
came
to
her
house
at
long
intervals
nothing
whatever
was
shown
tending
to
explain
who
the
prisoner
was
or
whence
he
had
come
it
was
shown
that
on
tuesday
preceding
the
killing
the
archbishop
had
received
a
communication
from
nina
san
croix
in
which
she
said
she
desired
to
make
a
statement
of
the
greatest
import
and
asking
for
an
audience
to
this
the
archbishop
replied
that
he
would
willingly
grant
her
a
hearing
if
she
would
come
to
him
at
eleven
on
friday
morning
two
policemen
testified
that
about
eight
on
the
night
of
thursday
they
had
noticed
the
prisoner
slip
into
the
gate
of
nina
san
croix
residence
and
go
down
to
the
side
of
the
house
where
he
was
admitted
that
his
appearance
and
seeming
haste
had
attracted
their
attention
that
they
had
concluded
that
it
was
some
clandestine
amour
and
out
of
curiosity
had
both
slipped
down
to
the
house
and
endeavored
to
find
a
position
from
which
they
could
see
into
the
room
but
were
unable
to
do
so
and
were
about
to
go
back
to
the
street
when
they
heard
a
woman
voice
cry
out
in
great
anger
i
know
that
you
love
her
and
that
you
want
to
get
rid
of
me
but
you
shall
not
do
it
you
murdered
him
but
you
shall
not
murder
me
i
have
all
the
evidence
to
convict
you
of
murdering
him
the
archbishop
will
have
it
they
shall
hang
you
do
you
hear
me
they
shall
hang
you
for
his
murder
that
thereupon
one
of
the
policemen
proposed
that
they
should
break
into
the
house
and
see
what
was
wrong
but
the
other
had
urged
that
it
was
only
the
usual
lovers
quarrel
and
if
they
should
interfere
they
would
find
nothing
upon
which
a
charge
could
be
based
and
would
only
be
laughed
at
by
the
chief
that
they
had
waited
and
listened
for
a
time
but
hearing
nothing
further
had
gone
back
to
the
street
and
contented
themselves
with
keeping
a
strict
watch
on
the
house
the
people
proved
further
that
on
thursday
evening
nina
san
croix
had
given
the
old
negro
domestic
a
sum
of
money
and
dismissed
her
with
the
instruction
that
she
was
not
to
return
until
sent
for
the
old
woman
testified
that
she
had
gone
directly
to
the
house
of
her
son
and
later
had
discovered
that
she
had
forgotten
some
articles
of
clothing
which
she
needed
that
thereupon
she
had
returned
to
the
house
and
had
gone
up
the
back
way
to
her
room
this
was
about
eight
that
while
there
she
had
heard
nina
san
croix
voice
in
great
passion
and
remembered
that
she
had
used
the
words
stated
by
the
policemen
that
these
sudden
violent
cries
had
frightened
her
greatly
and
she
had
bolted
the
door
and
been
afraid
to
leave
the
room
shortly
thereafter
she
had
heard
heavy
footsteps
ascending
the
stairs
slowly
and
with
great
difficulty
as
though
some
one
were
carrying
a
heavy
burden
that
therefore
her
fear
had
increased
and
that
she
had
put
out
the
light
and
hidden
under
the
bed
she
remembered
hearing
the
footsteps
moving
about
for
many
hours
how
long
she
could
not
tell
finally
about
four
in
the
morning
she
crept
out
opened
the
door
slipped
down
stairs
and
ran
out
into
the
street
there
she
had
found
the
policemen
and
requested
them
to
search
the
house
the
two
officers
had
gone
to
the
house
with
the
woman
she
had
opened
the
door
and
they
had
had
just
time
to
step
back
into
the
shadow
when
the
prisoner
entered
when
arrested
victor
ancona
had
screamed
with
terror
and
cried
out
it
was
no
use
it
was
no
use
to
do
it
the
chief
of
police
had
come
to
the
house
and
instituted
a
careful
search
in
the
room
below
from
which
the
cries
had
come
he
found
a
dress
which
was
identified
as
belonging
to
nina
san
croix
and
which
she
was
wearing
when
last
seen
by
the
domestic
about
six
that
evening
this
dress
was
covered
with
blood
and
had
a
slit
about
two
inches
long
in
the
left
side
of
the
bosom
into
which
the
mexican
knife
found
on
the
prisoner
fitted
perfectly
these
articles
were
introduced
in
evidence
and
it
was
shown
that
the
slit
would
be
exactly
over
the
heart
of
the
wearer
and
that
such
a
wound
would
certainly
result
in
death
there
was
much
blood
on
one
of
the
chairs
and
on
the
floor
there
was
also
blood
on
the
prisoner
coat
and
the
leg
of
his
trousers
and
the
heavy
mexican
knife
was
also
bloody
the
blood
was
shown
by
the
experts
to
be
human
blood
the
body
of
the
woman
was
not
found
and
the
most
rigid
and
tireless
search
failed
to
develop
the
slightest
trace
of
the
corpse
or
the
manner
of
its
disposal
the
body
of
the
woman
had
disappeared
as
completely
as
though
it
had
vanished
into
the
air
when
counsel
announced
that
he
had
closed
for
the
people
the
judge
turned
and
looked
gravely
down
at
mason
sir
he
said
the
evidence
for
the
defence
may
now
be
introduced
randolph
mason
arose
slowly
and
faced
the
judge
if
your
honor
please
he
said
speaking
slowly
and
distinctly
the
defendant
has
no
evidence
to
offer
he
paused
while
a
murmur
of
astonishment
ran
over
the
but
if
your
honor
please
he
continued
i
move
that
the
jury
be
directed
to
find
the
prisoner
not
guilty
the
crowd
stirred
the
counsel
for
the
people
smiled
the
judge
looked
sharply
at
the
speaker
over
his
glasses
on
what
ground
he
said
curtly
on
the
ground
replied
mason
that
the
has
not
been
proven
ah
said
the
judge
for
once
losing
his
judicial
gravity
mason
sat
down
abruptly
the
senior
counsel
for
the
prosecution
was
on
his
feet
in
a
moment
what
he
said
the
gentleman
bases
his
motion
on
a
failure
to
establish
the
delicti
does
he
jest
or
has
he
forgotten
the
evidence
the
term
is
technical
and
means
the
body
of
the
crime
or
the
substantial
fact
that
a
crime
has
been
committed
does
any
one
doubt
it
in
this
case
it
is
true
that
no
one
actually
saw
the
prisoner
kill
the
decedent
and
that
he
has
so
sucessfully
hidden
the
body
that
it
has
not
been
found
but
the
powerful
chain
of
circumstances
clear
and
proving
motive
the
criminal
agency
and
the
criminal
act
is
overwhelming
the
victim
in
this
case
is
on
the
eve
of
making
a
statement
that
would
prove
fatal
to
the
prisoner
the
night
before
the
statement
is
to
be
made
he
goes
to
her
residence
they
quarrel
her
voice
is
heard
raised
high
in
the
greatest
passion
denouncing
him
and
charging
that
he
is
a
murderer
that
she
has
the
evidence
and
will
reveal
it
that
he
shall
be
hanged
and
that
he
shall
not
be
rid
of
her
here
is
the
motive
for
the
crime
clear
as
light
are
not
the
bloody
knife
the
bloody
dress
the
bloody
clothes
of
the
prisoner
unimpeachable
witnesses
to
the
criminal
act
the
criminal
agency
of
the
prisoner
has
not
the
shadow
of
a
possibility
to
obscure
it
his
motive
is
gigantic
the
blood
on
him
and
his
despair
when
arrested
cry
murder
with
a
thousand
tongues
men
may
lie
but
circumstances
can
not
the
thousand
hopes
and
fears
and
passions
of
men
may
delude
or
bias
the
witness
yet
it
is
beyond
the
human
mind
to
conceive
that
a
clear
complete
chain
of
concatenated
circumstances
can
be
in
error
hence
it
is
that
the
greatest
jurists
have
declared
that
such
evidence
being
rarely
liable
to
delusion
or
fraud
is
safest
and
most
powerful
the
machinery
of
human
justice
can
not
guard
against
the
remote
and
improbable
doubt
the
inference
is
persistent
in
the
affairs
of
men
it
is
the
only
means
by
which
the
human
mind
reaches
the
truth
if
you
forbid
the
jury
to
exercise
it
you
bid
them
work
after
first
striking
off
their
hands
rule
out
the
irresistible
inference
and
the
end
of
justice
is
come
in
this
land
and
you
may
as
well
leave
the
spider
to
weave
his
web
through
the
abandoned
courtroom
the
attorney
stopped
looked
down
at
mason
with
a
pompous
sneer
and
retired
to
his
place
at
the
table
the
judge
sat
thoughtful
and
motionless
the
jurymen
leaned
forward
in
their
seats
if
your
honor
please
said
mason
rising
this
is
a
matter
of
law
plain
clear
and
so
well
settled
in
the
state
of
new
york
that
even
counsel
for
the
people
should
know
it
the
question
before
your
honor
is
simple
if
the
delicti
the
body
of
the
crime
has
been
proven
as
required
by
the
laws
of
the
commonwealth
then
this
case
should
go
to
the
jury
if
not
then
it
is
the
duty
of
this
court
to
direct
the
jury
to
find
the
prisoner
not
guilty
there
is
here
no
room
for
judicial
discretion
your
honor
has
but
to
recall
and
apply
the
rigid
rule
announced
by
our
courts
prescribing
distinctly
how
the
in
murder
must
be
proven
the
prisoner
here
stands
charged
with
the
highest
crime
the
law
demands
first
that
the
crime
as
a
fact
be
established
the
fact
that
the
victim
is
indeed
dead
must
first
be
made
certain
before
any
one
can
be
convicted
for
her
killing
because
so
long
as
there
remains
the
remotest
doubt
as
to
the
death
there
can
be
no
certainty
as
to
the
criminal
agent
although
the
circumstantial
evidence
indicating
the
guilt
of
the
accused
may
be
positive
complete
and
utterly
irresistible
in
murder
the
or
body
of
the
crime
is
composed
of
two
elements
death
as
a
result
the
criminal
agency
of
another
as
the
means
it
is
the
fixed
and
immutable
law
of
this
state
laid
down
in
the
leading
case
of
ruloff
the
people
and
binding
upon
this
court
that
both

there
must

proof
of
one
or
the
other
of
these
two
component
elements
of
the
if
one
is
proven
by
direct
evidence
the

may
be
presumed
but
both
shall

be
presumed
from
circumstances
no
matter
how
powerful
how
cogent
or
how
completely
overwhelming
the
circumstances
may
be
in
other
words
no
man
can
be
convicted
of
murder
in
the
state
of
new
york
unless
the
body
of
the
victim
be
found
and
identified
or
there
be
direct
proof
that
the
prisoner
did
some
act
adequate
to
produce
death
and
did
it
in
such
a
manner
as
to
account
for
the
disappearance
of
the
body
the
face
of
the
judge
cleared
and
grew
hard
the
members
of
the
bar
were
attentive
and
alert
they
were
beginning
to
see
the
legal
escape
open
up
the
audience
were
puzzled
they
did
not
yet
understand
mason
turned
to
the
counsel
for
the
people
his
ugly
face
was
bitter
with
contempt
for
three
days
he
said
i
have
been
tortured
by
this
useless
and
expensive
farce
if
counsel
for
the
people
had
been
other
than
playactors
they
would
have
known
in
the
beginning
that
victor
ancona
could
not
be
convicted
for
murder
unless
he
were
confronted
in
this
courtroom
with
a
living
witness
who
had
looked
into
the
dead
face
of
nina
san
croix
or
if
not
that
a
living
witness
who
had
seen
him
drive
the
dagger
into
her
bosom
i
care
not
if
the
circumstantial
evidence
in
this
case
were
so
strong
and
irresistible
as
to
be
overpowering
if
the
judge
on
the
bench
if
the
jury
if
every
man
within
sound
of
my
voice
were
convinced
of
the
guilt
of
the
prisoner
to
the
degree
of
certainty
that
is
absolute
if
the
circumstantial
evidence
left
in
the
mind
no
shadow
of
the
remotest
improbable
doubt
yet
in
the
absence
of
the
this
prisoner
can
not
be
punished
and
this
court
must
compel
the
jury
to
acquit
him
the
audience
now
understood
and
they
were
dumbfounded
surely
this
was
not
the
law
they
had
been
taught
that
the
law
was
common
sense
and
this
this
was
anything
else
mason
saw
it
all
and
grinned
in
its
tenderness
he
sneered
the
law
shields
the
innocent
the
good
law
of
new
york
reaches
out
its
hand
and
lifts
the
prisoner
out
of
the
clutches
of
the
fierce
jury
that
would
hang
him
mason
sat
down
the
room
was
silent
the
jurymen
looked
at
each
other
in
amazement
the
counsel
for
the
people
arose
his
face
was
white
with
anger
and
incredulous
your
honor
he
said
this
doctrine
is
monstrous
can
it
be
said
that
in
order
to
evade
punishment
the
murderer
has
only
to
hide
or
destroy
the
body
of
the
victim
or
sink
it
into
the
sea
then
if
he
is
not
seen
to
kill
the
law
is
powerless
and
the
murderer
can
snap
his
finger
in
the
face
of
retributive
justice
if
this
is
the
law
then
the
law
for
the
highest
crime
is
a
dead
letter
the
great
commonwealth
winks
at
murder
and
invites
every
man
to
kill
his
enemy
provided
he
kill
him
in
secret
and
hide
him
i
repeat
your
honor
the
man
voice
was
now
loud
and
angry
and
rang
through
the
that
this
doctrine
is
monstrous
so
said
best
and
story
and
many
another
muttered
mason
and
the
law
remained
the
court
said
the
judge
abruptly
desires
no
further
argument
the
counsel
for
the
people
resumed
his
seat
his
face
lighted
up
with
triumph
the
court
was
going
to
sustain
him
the
judge
turned
and
looked
down
at
the
jury
he
was
grave
and
spoke
with
deliberate
emphasis
gentlemen
of
the
jury
he
said
the
rule
of
lord
hale
obtains
in
this
state
and
is
binding
upon
me
it
is
the
law
as
stated
by
counsel
for
the
prisoner
that
to
warrant
conviction
of
murder
there
must
be
direct
proof
either
of
the
death
as
of
the
finding
and
identification
of
the
corpse
or
of
criminal
violence
adequate
to
produce
death
and
exerted
in
such
a
manner
as
to
account
for
the
disappearance
of
the
body
and
it
is
only
when
there
is
direct
proof
of
the
one
that
the
other
can
be
established
by
circumstantial
evidence
this
is
the
law
and
can
not
now
be
departed
from
i
do
not
presume
to
explain
its
wisdom
johnson
has
observed
in
the
leading
case
that
it
may
have
its
probable
foundation
in
the
idea
that
where
direct
proof
is
absent
as
to
both
the
fact
of
the
death
and
of
criminal
violence
capable
of
producing
death
no
evidence
can
rise
to
the
degree
of
moral
certainty
that
the
individual
is
dead
by
criminal
intervention
or
even
lead
by
direct
inference
to
this
result
and
that
where
the
fact
of
death
is
not
certainly
ascertained
all
inculpatory
circumstantial
evidence
wants
the
key
necessary
for
its
satisfactory
interpretation
and
can
not
be
depended
on
to
furnish
more
than
probable
results
it
may
be
also
that
such
a
rule
has
some
reference
to
the
dangerous
possibility
that
a
general
preconception
of
guilt
or
a
general
excitement
of
popular
feeling
may
creep
in
to
supply
the
place
of
evidence
if
upon
other
than
direct
proof
of
death
or
a
cause
of
death
a
jury
are
permitted
to
pronounce
a
prisoner
guilty
in
this
case
the
body
has
not
been
found
and
there
is
no
direct
proof
of
criminal
agency
on
the
part
of
the
prisoner
although
the
chain
of
circumstantial
evidence
is
complete
and
irresistible
in
the
highest
degree
nevertheless
it
is
all
circumstantial
evidence
and
under
the
laws
of
new
york
the
prisoner
can
not
be
punished
i
have
no
right
of
discretion
the
law
does
not
permit
a
conviction
in
this
case
although
every
one
of
us
may
be
morally
certain
of
the
prisoner
guilt
i
am
therefore
gentlemen
of
the
jury
compelled
to
direct
you
to
find
the
prisoner
not
guilty
judge
interrupted
the
foreman
jumping
up
in
the
box
we
can
not
find
that
verdict
under
our
oath
we
know
that
this
man
is
guilty
sir
said
the
judge
this
is
a
matter
of
law
in
which
the
wishes
of
the
jury
can
not
be
considered
the
clerk
will
write
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
which
you
as
foreman
will
sign
the
spectators
broke
out
into
a
threatening
murmur
that
began
to
grow
and
gather
volume
the
judge
rapped
on
his
desk
and
ordered
the
bailiffs
promptly
to
suppress
any
demonstration
on
the
part
of
the
audience
then
he
directed
the
foreman
to
sign
the
verdict
prepared
by
the
clerk
when
this
was
done
he
turned
to
victor
ancona
his
face
was
hard
and
there
was
a
cold
glitter
in
his
eyes
prisoner
at
the
bar
he
said
you
have
been
put
to
trial
before
this
tribunal
on
a
charge
of
and
atrocious
murder
the
evidence
produced
against
you
was
of
such
powerful
and
overwhelming
character
that
it
seems
to
have
left
no
doubt
in
the
minds
of
the
jury
nor
indeed
in
the
mind
of
any
person
present
in
this
had
the
question
of
your
guilt
been
submitted
to
these
twelve
arbiters
a
conviction
would
certainly
have
resulted
and
the
death
penalty
would
have
been
imposed
but
the
law
rigid
passionless
has
thrust
in
between
you
and
the
wrath
of
your
fellows
and
saved
you
from
it
i
do
not
cry
out
against
the
impotency
of
the
law
it
is
perhaps
as
wise
as
imperfect
humanity
could
make
it
i
deplore
rather
the
genius
of
evil
men
who
by
cunning
design
are
enabled
to
slip
through
the
fingers
of
this
law
i
have
no
word
of
censure
or
admonition
for
you
victor
ancona
the
law
of
new
york
compels
me
to
acquit
you
i
am
only
its
mouthpiece
with
my
individual
wishes
throttled
i
speak
only
those
things
which
the
law
directs
i
shall
speak
you
are
now
at
liberty
to
leave
this
not
guiltless
of
the
crime
of
murder
perhaps
but
at
least
rid
of
its
punishment
the
eyes
of
men
may
see
cain
mark
on
your
brow
but
the
eyes
of
the
law
are
blind
to
it
when
the
audience
fully
realized
what
the
judge
had
said
they
were
amazed
and
silent
they
knew
as
well
as
men
could
know
that
victor
ancona
was
guilty
of
murder
and
yet
he
was
now
going
out
of
the
free
could
it
happen
that
the
law
protected
only
against
the
blundering
rogue
they
had
heard
always
of
the
boasted
completeness
of
the
law
which
magistrates
from
time
immemorial
had
labored
to
perfect
and
now
when
the
skilful
villain
sought
to
evade
it
they
saw
how
weak
a
thing
it
was
the
wedding
march
of
lohengrin
floated
out
from
the
episcopal
church
of

clear
and
sweet
and
perhaps
heavy
with
its
paradox

the
theatre
of
this
coming

wilderness

said
the

i
do
agree
with
your
faith
in
providence
at
all
for
the
last
ten
years
it
has
kept
too
far
afield
of
our
house
in
every
matter
of
importance
it
has
never
once
shown
its
face
to
us
except
for
the
purpose
of
interposing
some
fatal
wrecker
just
at
the
critical
moment
do
you
remember
how
it
helped
barton
woodlas
rob
our
father
in
that
shoe
trust
at
lynn
and
you
will
recall
the
railroad
venture
of
our
own
did
not
the
cursed
thing
go
into
the
hands
of
a
receiver
the
very
moment
we
had
gotten
the
stock
cornered
and
look
at
the
oil
deal
did
not
the
tools
stick
in
both
test
wells
within
fifty
feet
of
the
sand
and
all
the
saints
could
not
remove
them
i
tell
you
i
have
no
faith
in
it
the
same
thing
is
going
to
happen
again
there
is
some
truth
in
your
rant
brother
replied
the
light
man
but
i
cling
to
my
superstition
we
have
a
cool
million
in
this
thing
a
cool
million
if
we
can
only
break
the
chicago
corner
the
market
is
bound
to
turn
the
thing
is
below
the
cost
of
production
now
and
this
western
combine
is
already
groggy
ten
thousand
would
break
its
backbone
and
leave
us
in
a
position
to
force
the
market
up
to
the
ceiling
but
how
in
heaven
name
sidney
are
we
going
to
get
the
other
five
thousand
at
ten
i
put
up
everything
that
could
be
scraped
together
begged
or
borrowed
and
out
of
it
all
we
have
scarcely
five
thousand
dollars
for
any
good
that
amount
will
do
we
might
as
well
have
none
at
all
we
know
that
this
combine
would
in
all
probability
weather
a
plunge
of
five
thousand
while
a
bold
plunge
of
ten
thousand
would
rout
it
as
certainly
as
there
is
a
sun
in
heaven
but
we
only
have
half
enough
money
and
no
means
of
getting
another
dollar
if
there
were
ten
millions
in
it
the
case
would
be
the
same
the
jig
is
up
i
do
think
so
gordon
i
do
give
it
up
we
must
raise
the
money
raise
the
money
put
in
the
other
bitterly
as
well
talk
of
raising
the
soul
of
samuel
did
i
say
that
i
had
raised
the
last
money
that
human
ingenuity
could
raise
that
there
was
not
another
shining
thing
left
on
earth
to
either
of
us
but
our
beauty
and
it
would
take
genius
to
raise
money
on
that
sidney
gigantic
genius
he
stopped
and
looked
at
his
brother
the
brother
poured
his
soda
into
the
brandy
and
said
simply
we
must
find
it
you
find
it
said
gordon
montcure
getting
up
and
walking
backward
and
forward
across
the
room
for
full
ten
minutes
sidney
montcure
studied
the
bottom
of
his
glass
then
he
looked
up
and
said
brother
do
you
remember
the
little
man
who
stopped
us
on
the
steps
of
the
stock
exchange
last
week
yes
you
mean
the
old
ghost
with
the
thin
melancholy
face
the
same
you
remember
he
said
that
if
we
were
ever
in
a
desperate
financial
position
we
should
come
to
the
office
building
on
the
wall
street
corner
and
inquire
for
randolph
mason
and
that
mason
would
show
us
a
way
out
of
the
difficulty
but
that
under
no
circumstances
were
we
to
say
how
we
happened
to
come
to
him
except
that
we
had
heard
of
his
ability
i
recall
the
queer
old
chap
well
said
the
other
he
seemed
too
clean
and
serious
for
a
fakir
but
i
suppose
that
is
what
he
was
unless
he
is
wrong
in
the
head
which
is
more
probable
do
you
know
brother
said
sidney
montcure
thrusting
his
hands
into
his
pockets
i
have
been
thinking
of
him
and
i
have
a
great
mind
to
go
down
there
in
the
morning
just
for
a
flyer
if
there
is
any
such
man
as
randolph
mason
he
is
not
a
fakir
because
i
know
the
building
and
he
could
not
secure
an
office
in
any
such
prominent
place
unless
he
was
substantial
that
is
true
although
i
am
convinced
that
you
will
find
randolph
mason
a
myth
at
any
rate
we
have
nothing
to
lose
brother
there
may
be
something
in
it
will
you
go
with
me
morning
the
dark
man
nodded
assent
and
proceeded
to
add
his
autograph
to
the
club
collection
as
evidenced
by
its
wine
ticket
gordon
and
sidney
montcure
were
club
men
of
the
new
york
type
brokers
and
plungers
until
three
immaculate
gentlemen
thereafter
both
were
shrewd
men
of
the
world
and
as
they
left
the
ephmere
club
that
night
that
same
club
and
divers
of
various
guilds
had
heavy
equitable
interests
in
the
success
of
their
plans
shortly
after
ten
the
following
morning
the
two
brothers
entered
the
great
building
in
which
randolph
mason
was
supposed
to
have
his
office
there
on
the
directory
was
indeed
the
name
but
it
bore
no
indication
of
his
business
and
simply
informed
the
stranger
that
he
was
to
be
found
on
the
second
floor
front
the
two
men
stepped
into
the
elevator
and
asked
the
boy
to
show
them
to
mason
office
the
boy
put
them
off
on
the
second
floor
and
directed
them
to
enquire
at
the
third
door
to
the
left
they
found
here
a
frosted
glass
door
with
randolph
mason
counsellor
on
an
ancient
silver
strip
fastened
to
the
middle
panel
sidney
montcure
opened
the
door
and
the
two
entered
the
office
room
into
which
they
came
was
large
and
scrupulously
clean
the
walls
were
literally
covered
with
maps
of
every
description
two
rows
of
mammoth
closed
bookcases
extended
across
the
room
and
there
were
numerous
file
cases
of
the
most
improved
pattern
at
a
big
table
literally
heaped
with
letters
sat
their
friend
the
little
bald
melancholy
man
writing
as
though
his
very
life
and
soul
were
at
stake
we
desire
to
speak
with
mason
sir
said
sidney
montcure
addressing
the
little
man
the
man
arose
and
went
into
the
adjoining
room
in
a
moment
he
returned
and
announced
that
mason
would
see
the
gentlemen
at
once
in
his
private
office
they
found
the
private
office
of
randolph
mason
to
be
in
appearance
much
like
the
private
office
of
a
corporation
attorney
the
walls
were
lined
with
closed
bookcases
and
there
were
piles
of
plats
and
blue
prints
and
bundles
of
papers
scattered
over
a
mahogany
table
randolph
mason
turned
round
in
his
chair
as
the
men
entered
be
seated
gentlemen
he
said
removing
his
in
what
manner
can
i
be
of
service
his
articulation
was
metallic
and
precise
we
have
had
occasion
to
hear
of
your
ability
mason
said
gordon
montcure
and
we
have
called
to
lay
our
difficulty
before
you
in
the
hope
that
you
may
be
able
to
suggest
some
remedy
it
may
be
that
our
dilemma
is
beyond
the
scope
of
your
vocation
as
it
is
not
a
legal
matter
let
me
hear
the
difficulty
said
mason
bluntly
we
are
in
a
most
unfortunate
and
critical
position
said
gordon
montcure
my
brother
and
myself
are
members
of
the
board
of
trade
and
in
defiance
of
the
usual
rule
occasionally
speculate
for
ourselves
after
making
elaborate
and
careful
investigation
we
concluded
that
the
wheat
market
had
reached
bottom
and
was
on
the
verge
of
a
strong
and
unusual
advance
we
based
this
conclusion
on
two
safe
indications
the
failure
in
production
of
the
other
staples
and
the
fact
that
the
price
of
wheat
was
slightly
below
the
bare
cost
of
production
this
status
of
the
market
we
believed
could
not
remain
and
on
monday
last
we
bought
heavily
on
a
slight
margin
the
market
continued
to
fall
we
covered
our
margins
and
plunged
in
order
to
bull
the
market
to
our
surprise
the
decline
continued
we
gathered
all
our
ready
money
and
plunged
again
the
market
wavered
but
continued
to
decline
slowly
then
it
developed
that
there
was
a
chicago
combine
against
us
we
at
once
set
about
ascertaining
the
exact
financial
status
of
this
combine
and
discovered
that
it
was
now
very
weak
and
that
a
bold
plunge
of
ten
thousand
dollars
would
rout
it
but
unfortunately
all
our
ready
money
was
now
gone
after
exhausting
every
security
and
resorting
to
every
imaginable
means
we
have
only
five
thousand
dollars
in
all
this
sum
is
utterly
useless
under
the
circumstances
for
we
know
well
that
the
combine
would
hold
out
against
a
plunge
of
this
dimension
and
we
would
simply
lose
everything
while
a
bold
sudden
plunge
of
ten
thousand
would
certainly
break
the
market
and
make
us
a
vast
fortune
of
course
no
sane
man
will
lend
us
money
under
circumstances
of
this
kind
and
it
is
not
possible
for
us
to
raise
another
dollar
on
earth
the
speaker
leaned
back
in
his
chair
like
a
man
who
has
stated
what
he
knows
to
be
a
hopeless
case
we
are
consuming
your
time
unnecessarily
he
added
our
case
is
of
course
remediless
mason
did
not
at
once
reply
he
turned
round
in
his
chair
and
looked
out
of
the
open
window
the
two
brothers
observed
him
more
closely
they
noticed
that
his
clothing
was
evidently
of
the
best
that
he
was
scrupulously
neat
and
clean
and
wore
no
ornament
of
any
kind
even
the
eyeglasses
were
attached
to
a
black
silk
guard
and
had
a
severely
plain
steel
spring
have
you
a
middle
name
sir
he
said
turning
suddenly
to
sidney
montcure
yes
replied
the
man
addressed
van
guilder
i
am
named
for
my
grandfather
an
old
and
wealthy
family
of
this
city
and
well
known
in
new
england
said
mason
that
is
fortunate
then
he
bent
forward
and
looking
straight
into
the
eyes
of
his
clients
said
gentlemen
if
you
are
ready
to
do
exactly
what
i
direct
you
will
have
five
thousand
dollars
by
night
is
that
enough
ample
replied
gordon
montcure
and
we
are
ready
to
follow
your
instructions
to
the
letter
in
any
matter
that
is
not
criminal
the
transaction
will
be
safely
beyond
the
criminal
statutes
said
mason
although
it
is
close
to
the
border
line
of
the
law
is
as
good
as
a
mile
said
gordon
montcure
let
us
hear
your
plan
it
is
this
said
mason
down
at
lynn
massachusetts
there
is
a
certain
retired
shoe
manufacturer
of
vast
wealth
accumulated
by
questionable
transactions
he
is
now
passing
into
the
sixties
and
like
every
man
of
his
position
is
restless
and
unsatisfied
five
years
ago
he
concluded
to
build
a
magnificent
residence
in
the
suburbs
of
lynn
he
spared
nothing
to
make
the
place
palatial
in
every
respect
the
work
has
been
completed
within
the
past
summer
the
grounds
are
superb
and
the
place
is
indeed
princely
as
long
as
the
palace
was
in
process
of
building
the
old
gentleman
was
interested
and
delighted
but
no
sooner
was
it
finished
than
like
all
men
of
his
type
he
was
at
once
dissatisfied
he
now
thinks
that
he
would
like
to
travel
on
the
continent
but
he
has
constructed
a
frankenstein
monster
which
he
imagines
requires
his
personal
care
he
will
not
trust
it
to
an
agent
he
does
not
dare
to
rent
it
and
he
can
find
no
purchaser
for
such
a
palace
in
such
a
little
city
the
mere
fact
that
he
can
not
do
exactly
as
he
pleases
is
a
source
of
huge
vexation
to
such
a
man
as
old
barton
woodlas
of
the
shoe
trust
the
two
montcures
apparently
gave
no
visible
evidence
of
their
mighty
surprise
and
interest
at
the
mention
of
the
man
who
had
robbed
their
father
yet
mason
evidently
saw
something
in
the
tail
of
their
eyes
for
he
smiled
with
the
lower
half
of
his
face
and
continued
you
sir
he
said
speaking
directly
to
sidney
montcure
must
go
to
lynn
and
buy
this
house
in
the
morning
buy
the
house
answered
the
man
bitterly
your
irony
approaches
the
sublime
we
have
only
five
thousand
dollars
and
no
security
how
could
we
buy
a
house
i
am
meeting
the
difficulties
if
you
please
sir
said
mason
and
not
yourself
at
ten
tomorrow
you
must
be
at
lynn
at
two
you
will
call
upon
barton
woodlas
giving
your
name
as
sidney
van
guilder
from
new
york
he
knows
that
family
and
will
at
once
presume
your
wealth
you
will
say
to
him
that
you
desire
to
purchase
a
country
place
for
your
grandfather
and
heard
of
his
residence
the
old
gentleman
will
at
once
jump
at
this
chance
for
a
wealthy
purchaser
and
drive
you
out
to
his
grounds
you
will
criticise
somewhat
and
make
some
objections
but
will
finally
conclude
to
purchase
if
satisfactory
terms
can
be
made
here
you
will
find
barton
woodlas
a
shrewd
business
dealer
and
you
must
follow
my
instructions
to
the
very
letter
he
will
finally
agree
to
take
about
fifty
thousand
dollars
you
will
make
the
purchase
proposing
to
pay
down
five
thousand
cash
and
give
a
mortgage
on
the
property
for
the
residue
of
the
purchase
money
making
notes
five
thousand
in
hand
and
a
mortgage
will
of
course
be
safe
and
the
old
gentleman
will
take
it
you
demand
immediate
possession
and
as
he
is
not
residing
in
the
house
you
will
get
it
go
with
him
at
once
to
his
attorney
pay
the
money
have
the
papers
signed
and
recorded
and
be
in
full
possession
of
the
property
by
four
in
the
afternoon
mason
stopped
abruptly
and
turned
to
gordon
montcure
sir
he
said
curtly
i
must
ask
you
to
step
into
the
other
office
and
remain
until
i
have
finished
my
instructions
to
your
brother
i
have
found
it
best
to
explain
to
each
individual
that
part
of
the
transaction
which
he
is
expected
to
perform
suggestions
made
in
the
presence
of
a
third
party
invariably
lead
to
disaster
gordon
montcure
went
into
the
outer
room
and
sat
down
he
was
impressed
by
this
strange
interview
with
mason
here
was
certainly
one
of
the
most
powerful
and
mysterious
men
he
had
ever
met
one
whom
he
could
not
understand
who
was
a
mighty
enigma
but
the
man
was
so
clear
and
positive
that
montcure
concluded
to
do
exactly
as
he
said
after
all
the
money
they
were
risking
was
utterly
worthless
as
matters
now
stood
in
a
few
moments
sidney
montcure
came
out
of
the
private
office
and
took
a
cab
for
the
depot
leaving
his
brother
in
private
interview
with
randolph
mason
ii
the
following
afternoon
gordon
montcure
stepped
from
the
train
at
lynn
an
hour
before
he
had
received
a
telegram
from
mason
saying
that
the
deal
had
been
made
and
that
his
brother
was
in
possession
of
the
property
and
authorizing
him
to
proceed
according
to
instructions
he
was
a
man
of
business
methods
and
began
at
once
to
play
his
part
calling
a
carriage
he
went
to
the
and
ascertained
that
the
deed
had
been
properly
recorded
then
he
drove
to
the
hotel
of
barton
woodlas
and
demanded
to
see
that
gentleman
at
once
he
was
shown
into
a
private
parlor
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
shoe
capitalist
came
down
he
was
a
short
nervous
fat
man
with
a
pompous
strut
woodlas
i
presume
said
gordon
the
same
sir
was
the
answer
to
what
am
i
indebted
for
this
honor
to
be
brief
replied
montcure
i
am
looking
for
one
sidney
van
guilder
i
am
informed
that
he
was
with
you
in
this
city
can
you
tell
me
where
i
can
see
him
why
yes
said
the
old
gentleman
anxiously
i
suppose
he
is
out
at
the
residence
i
sold
him
for
his
grandfather
is
there
anything
wrong
what
cried
montcure
starting
up
you
sold
him
a
residence
curse
the
luck
i
am
too
late
he
is
evidently
into
his
old
tricks
old
tricks
said
the
little
fat
man
growing
pale
what
in
name
is
wrong
with
him
speak
out
man
speak
out
to
come
at
once
to
the
point
said
gordon
montcure
van
guilder
is
just
a
little
offcolor
he
is
shrewd
and
all
right
in
every
way
except
for
this
one
peculiarity
he
seems
to
have
an
insane
desire
to
purchase
fine
buildings
and
convert
them
into
homes
for
his
horses
he
has
attempted
to
change
several
houses
on
fifth
avenue
into
palatial
stables
and
has
only
been
prevented
by
the
city
authorities
in
all
human
probability
the
house
you
have
sold
him
will
be
full
of
stalls
by
morning
my
house
full
of
stalls
yelled
the
little
fat
man
my
house
that
i
have
spent
so
much
money
on
and
my
beautiful
grounds
a
never
never
come
on
sir
come
on
we
must
go
there
at
once
and
barton
woodlas
waddled
out
of
the
room
as
fast
as
his
short
legs
could
carry
him
gordon
montcure
followed
smiling
both
men
climbed
into
montcure
carriage
and
hurried
out
to
the
suburban
residence
the
grounds
were
indeed
magnificent
and
the
house
a
palace
as
they
drove
in
they
noticed
several
italian
laborers
digging
a
trench
across
the
lawn
barton
woodlas
tumbled
out
of
the
carriage
and
bolted
into
the
house
followed
by
montcure
here
they
found
a
scene
of
the
greatest
confusion
the
house
was
filled
with
grimy
workmen
they
were
taking
off
the
doors
and
shutters
and
removing
the
stairway
and
hammering
in
different
portions
of
the
house
until
the
noise
was
like
bedlam
sidney
van
guilder
stood
in
the
with
his
coat
off
directing
his
workmen
his
clothing
was
disarranged
and
dusty
but
he
was
apparently
enthusiastic
and
happy
stop
sir
stop
cried
barton
woodlas
waving
his
arms
and
rushing
into
the
room
put
these
dirty
workmen
out
of
here
and
stop
this
vandalism
at
once
at
once
sidney
van
guilder
turned
round
smiling
ah
he
said
is
it
you
woodlas
i
am
getting
on
swimmingly
you
see
this
will
make
a
magnificent
stable
i
can
put
my
horses
on
both
floors
but
i
will
be
compelled
to
cut
the
inside
all
out
and
make
great
changes
it
is
a
pity
that
you
built
your
rooms
so
big
for
a
moment
the
little
man
was
speechless
with
rage
then
he
danced
up
and
down
and
yelled
oh
you
crazy
fool
you
crazy
fool
you
are
destroying
my
house
it
wo
be
worth
a
dollar
i
beg
your
pardon
said
van
guilder
coldly
this
is
my
house
and
i
shall
do
with
it
as
i
like
i
have
bought
it
and
i
shall
make
a
home
for
my
horses
of
it
by
morning
it
can
not
possibly
be
any
business
of
yours
no
business
of
mine
shouted
woodlas
what
security
have
i
but
the
mortgage
and
if
you
go
on
with
this
cursed
gutting
the
mortgage
be
worth
a
dollar
oh
my
beautiful
house
my
beautiful
house
it
is
awful
awful
come
on
sir
he
yelled
to
gordon
montcure
i
will
find
a
way
to
stop
the
blooming
idiot
with
that
he
rushed
out
of
the
house
and
rolled
into
the
carriage
gordon
montcure
following
together
the
two
men
were
driven
furiously
to
the
office
of
vinson
harcout
counsellor
for
the
shoe
trust
that
usually
placid
and
unexcitable
gentleman
turned
round
in
astonishment
as
the
two
men
bolted
into
his
private
office
woodlas
dropped
into
a
chair
and
between
curses
and
puffs
of
exhaustion
began
to
describe
his
trouble
when
the
lawyer
had
finally
succeeded
in
drawing
from
the
irate
old
man
a
full
understanding
of
the
matter
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
stroked
his
chin
thoughtfully
well
he
said
this
is
an
unfortunate
state
of
affairs
but
there
is
really
no
legal
remedy
for
it
the
title
to
the
property
is
in
van
guilder
he
is
in
possession
by
due
and
proper
process
of
law
and
he
can
do
as
he
pleases
even
to
the
extent
of
destroying
the
property
utterly
if
he
chooses
to
convert
his
residence
into
a
stable
he
certainly
commits
no
crime
and
simply
exercises
a
right
which
is
legally
his
own
it
is
true
that
you
have
such
equitable
interest
in
the
property
that
you
might
be
able
to
stop
him
by
injunction
proceedings
we
will
try
that
at
any
rate
the
attorney
stopped
and
turned
to
his
stenographer
william
he
said
ask
the
clerk
if
judge
henderson
is
in
the
the
young
man
went
to
the
telephone
and
returned
in
a
moment
judge
henderson
is
not
in
the
city
sir
he
said
the
clerk
answers
that
he
went
to
boston
early
in
the
day
to
meet
with
some
judicial
committee
from
new
york
and
will
not
return
until
the
lawyer
face
lengthened
well
he
said
that
is
the
end
of
it
we
could
not
possibly
reach
him
in
time
to
prevent
van
guilder
from
carrying
out
his
intentions
gordon
montcure
smiled
grimly
mason
had
promised
to
inveigle
away
the
resident
judge
by
means
of
a
bogus
telegram
and
he
had
done
so
oh
wailed
the
little
fat
man
is
there
no
law
to
keep
me
from
being
ruined
ca
i
have
him
arrested
sir
unfortunately
no
replied
the
lawyer
he
is
committing
no
crime
he
is
simply
doing
what
he
has
a
full
legal
right
to
do
if
he
so
chooses
and
neither
you
nor
any
other
man
can
interfere
with
him
if
you
attempt
it
you
at
once
become
a
violator
of
the
law
and
proceed
at
your
peril
you
are
the
victim
of
a
grave
wrong
woodlas
your
security
is
being
destroyed
and
great
loss
may
possibly
result
yet
there
is
absolutely
no
remedy
except
the
possible
injunction
which
in
the
absence
of
the
judge
is
no
remedy
at
all
it
is
an
exasperating
and
unfortunate
position
for
you
but
as
i
said
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
the
face
of
barton
woodlas
grew
white
and
his
jaw
dropped
gone
he
muttered
all
gone
five
thousand
dollars
and
a
stable
as
security
for
forty
thousand
it
is
ruin
ruin
i
am
indeed
sorry
said
the
attorney
with
a
feeling
of
pity
that
was
unusual
but
there
is
no
remedy
unless
perhaps
you
could
repurchase
the
property
before
it
is
injured
ah
said
the
little
fat
man
straightening
up
in
his
chair
i
had
not
thought
of
that
i
will
do
it
come
on
both
of
you
and
he
hurried
to
the
carriage
without
waiting
for
an
answer
at
the
residence
in
question
the
three
men
found
matters
as
barton
woodlas
had
last
seen
them
except
that
the
trench
across
the
lawn
was
now
half
completed
and
the
doors
and
shutters
had
all
been
removed
from
the
house
and
piled
up
on
the
veranda
sidney
van
guilder
laughed
at
their
proposition
to
repurchase
he
assured
them
that
he
had
long
been
looking
for
just
this
kind
of
property
that
it
suited
him
perfectly
and
that
he
would
not
think
of
parting
with
it
the
attorney
for
offered
two
thousand
advance
then
three
then
four
but
sidney
van
guilder
was
immovable
finally
gordon
montcure
suggested
that
perhaps
the
city
would
not
allow
his
stable
to
remain
after
he
had
completed
it
and
advised
him
to
name
some
price
for
the
property
van
guilder
seemed
to
consider
this
possibility
with
some
seriousness
he
had
presumably
had
this
trouble
in
new
york
city
and
finally
said
that
he
would
take
ten
thousand
dollars
for
his
bargain
old
barton
woodlas
fumed
and
cursed
and
ground
his
teeth
and
damned
every
citizen
of
the
state
of
new
york
from
the
coast
to
the
lakes
for
a
thief
a
villain
and
a
robber
finally
when
the
italians
began
to
cut
through
the
wall
of
the
and
the
fat
old
gentleman
grief
and
rage
were
fast
approaching
apoplexy
the
lawyer
raised
his
offer
to
seven
thousand
dollars
cash
and
sidney
van
guilder
reluctantly
accepted
it
and
dismissed
his
workmen
the
four
went
at
once
to
the
law
office
of
vinson
harcout
where
the
mortgage
and
notes
were
cancelled
the
money
paid
and
the
deed
prepared
reconveying
the
property
and
giving
barton
woodlas
immediate
possession
iii
at
the
following
morning
the
two
brothers
walked
into
the
private
office
of
randolph
mason
and
laid
down
seven
thousand
dollars
on
his
desk
mason
counted
out
two
thousand
and
thrust
it
into
his
pocket
gentlemen
he
said
shortly
here
is
the
five
thousand
dollars
which
i
promised
i
commend
you
for
following
my
instructions
strictly
we
have
obeyed
you
to
the
very
letter
said
gordon
montcure
handing
the
money
to
his
brother
except
in
one
particular
what
cried
mason
turning
upon
him
you
dared
to
change
my
plans
no
said
gordon
montcure
stepping
back
only
the
fool
lawyer
suggested
the
repurchase
before
i
could
do
it
ah
said
randolph
mason
sinking
back
into
his
chair
a
trifling
detail
i
bid
you

after
some
thirty
years
one
begins
to
appreciate
in
a
slight
degree
the
mystery
of
things
in
to
the
mystery
of
men
he
learns
with
dumb
horror
that
startling
and
unforeseen
events
break
into
the
shrewdest
plans
and
dash
them
to
pieces
utterly
or
with
grim

wrench
them
into

destruction
as
though
some
mighty
hand
reached
out

shattered
the

caught
the
chisel
in

and
drove
it
back

as

the

of
these
unforeseen
interpositions

as
what
he
is

he

after

nevertheless
it
is
the
manner
of
men
to
calculate
closely
in
their
youth
disregarding
the
factor
of
safety
and
ignoring
utterly
the
element
of

it
may
please

the
fact
that
men
are
amazed
and
dumbfounded
when
they
first
realize
the
gigantic
part
played
by
this
mysterious
power
in
all
human
affairs
and
immediately
thereafter
plan
to
evade
it
would
tend
to
the
conviction
that
there
might
be
some
means
by
which
these
startling
accidents
could
be
guarded
against
or
at
least
their
effect
counteracted
the
laws
if
in
truth
there
be
any
by
which
these
fortunes
and
misfortunes
come
to
men
are
as
yet
undetermined
except
that
they
arise
from
the
quarter
of
the
unexpected
and
by
means
oftentimes
of
the
commonplace
on
a
certain
friday
evening
in
july
carper
harris
confidential
clerk
of
the
great
wholesale
house
of
beaumont
milton
company
of
baltimore
was
suddenly
prostrated
under
the
horror
of
this
great
truth
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
fate
had
turned
about
and
struck
him
and
the
blow
had
been
delivered
with
all
her
strength
up
to
this
time
he
had
been
an
exceedingly
fortunate
man
to
begin
with
he
had
been
born
of
a
good
family
although
at
the
time
of
his
death
reduced
in
circumstances
while
quite
a
small
boy
he
had
been
taken
in
as
clerk
through
the
influence
of
milton
who
had
been
a
friend
of
his
father
the
good
blood
in
the
young
man
had
told
from
the
start
he
had
shown
himself
capable
and
unusually
shrewd
in
business
matters
and
had
risen
rapidly
to
the
position
of
chief
confidential
clerk
in
this
position
he
was
intrusted
with
the
most
important
matters
of
the
firm
and
was
familiar
with
all
its
business
relations
his
abilities
had
expanded
with
the
increasing
duties
of
his
successive
positions
he
had
done
the
firm
much
service
and
had
shown
himself
to
be
a
most
valuable
and
trustworthy
man
but
with
it
all
the
eyes
of
old
silas
beaumont
had
followed
his
every
act
in
season
and
out
of
season
tirelessly
it
was
a
favorite
theory
of
old
beaumont
that
the
great
knave
was
usually
the
man
of
irreproachable
habits
and
necessarily
the
man
of
powerful
and
unusual
abilities
and
that
instead
of
resorting
to
ordinary
vices
or
slight
acts
of
rascality
he
was
wont
to
bide
his
time
until
his
reputation
gained
him
opportunity
for
some
gigantic
act
of
dishonesty
whereby
he
could
make
a
vast
sum
at
one
stroke
old
beaumont
was
accustomed
to
cite
two
scriptural
passages
as
the
basis
of
his
theory
one
being
that
remark
of
david
in
his
haste
and
the
other
explanatory
of
what
the
lord
saw
when
he
repented
that
he
had
made
man
on
the
earth
like
all
those
of
his
type
when
this
theory
had
once
become
fixed
with
him
he
sought
on
all
occasions
for
instances
by
which
to
demonstrate
its
truthfulness
thus
it
happened
that
the
honesty
and
industry
of
young
harris
were
the
very
grounds
upon
which
beaumont
based
his
suspicions
and
his
acts
of
vigilance
when
it
was
proposed
that
carper
harris
should
go
to
europe
in
order
to
buy
certain
grades
of
pottery
which
the
firm
imported
beaumont
grumbled
and
intimated
that
it
was
taking
a
large
risk
to
intrust
money
to
him
he
said
the
sum
was
greater
than
the
young
man
had
been
accustomed
to
handle
that
big
amounts
of
cash
were
dangerous
baits
and
then
he
switched
over
to
his
theory
and
hinted
that
just
this
kind
of
opportunity
would
be
the
one
which
a
man
would
seize
for
his
master
act
of
dishonesty
the
other
members
of
the
firm
ridiculed
the
idea
and
arranged
the
matter
over
silas
beaumont
protest
thus
it
happened
that
about
seven
on
the
eventful
friday
carper
harris
left
baltimore
for
new
york
he
carried
a
small
containing
twenty
thousand
dollars
with
which
he
was
to
buy
foreign
exchange
arriving
at
the
depot
he
had
checked
his
luggage
and
had
gone
into
the
with
only
his
overcoat
and
the
little
he
laid
his
overcoat
across
the
back
of
the
seat
and
set
the
little
satchel
down
in
the
seat
beside
him
he
had
been
particularly
careful
that
the
money
should
be
constantly
guarded
and
for
that
reason
he
had
attempted
to
keep
his
hand
on
the
handle
of
the
bag
during
the
entire
trip
although
he
was
convinced
that
there
was
no
danger
or
risk
of
any
consequence
for
the
reason
that
no
one
would
suspect
that
the
satchel
contained
cash
when
he
arrived
in
new
york
he
had
gone
directly
to
his
hotel
and
asked
to
be
shown
up
to
his
room
it
was
his
intention
to
look
over
the
money
carefully
and
see
that
it
was
all
right
after
which
he
would
have
it
placed
in
one
of
the
deposit
boxes
in
the
hotel
safe
until
morning
when
harris
set
the
down
on
the
table
under
the
light
after
the
servant
had
left
the
room
something
about
its
general
appearance
struck
his
attention
and
he
bent
down
to
examine
it
closely
as
he
did
so
his
heart
seemed
to
leap
into
his
throat
and
the
cold
perspiration
burst
out
on
his
forehead
and
began
to
run
down
his
face
in
streams
the
satchel
before
him
on
the
table
was
not
the
one
in
which
he
had
placed
the
money
in
baltimore
and
with
which
he
had
left
the
of
beaumont
milton
company
the
young
man
attempted
to
insert
the
key
in
the
lock
of
the
satchel
but
his
hand
trembled
so
that
he
could
not
do
it
and
in
an
agony
of
fear
he
threw
down
the
keys
and
wrenched
the
satchel
open
his
great
fear
was
only
too
well
founded
the
satchel
contained
a
roll
of
newspapers
for
a
moment
carper
harris
stood
dazed
and
dumbfounded
by
his
awful
discovery
then
he
sank
down
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
of
all
the
dreaded
calamities
that
fate
could
have
sent
this
was
the
worst
all
that
he
had
hoped
for
and
labored
for
was
gone
by
a
stroke
wiped
out
ruthlessly
and
by
no
act
or
wrong
of
his
the
man
sat
on
the
floor
like
a
child
and
literally
wrung
his
hands
in
anguish
and
strove
to
realize
all
the
terrible
results
that
would
follow
in
the
wake
of
this
unforeseen
calamity
first
of
all
there
was
beaumont
theory
and
the
horror
of
the
thought
gripped
his
heart
like
a
frozen
hand
it
stood
like
some
grim
demon
barring
the
only
truthful
and
honorable
way
out
of
the
matter
how
could
he
go
back
and
say
that
he
had
been
robbed
beaumont
would
laugh
the
idea
to
scorn
and
gloat
over
the
confirmation
of
his
protest
little
would
explanation
avail
his
friends
would
turn
against
him
and
join
with
beaumont
and
seek
to
make
the
severity
of
their
accusation
against
him
atone
for
their
previous
trust
and
confidence
and
their
disregard
of
what
they
would
now
characterize
as
beaumont
unusual
foresight
and
then
if
they
would
listen
to
explanation
what
explanation
was
there
to
make
he
had
left
their
with
the
money
in
the
afternoon
and
now
in
new
york
in
the
evening
he
claimed
to
have
been
robbed
and
how
that
some
one
had
substituted
another
for
the
one
with
which
he
started
without
attacking
him
and
even
without
his
slightest
suspicion
a
probable
story
indeed
why
the
there
on
the
table
was
almost
exactly
like
the
one
he
had
taken
with
him
to
the
company
office
no
one
but
himself
could
tell
that
it
was
not
the
same
bag
the
whole
matter
would
be
considered
a
shrewd
trick
on
his
part
a
cunningly
arranged
scheme
to
rob
his
employers
of
this
large
sum
of
money
in
his
heated
fancy
he
could
see
the
whole
future
as
it
would
come
the
hard
smile
of
incredulity
with
which
his
story
would
be
greeted
the
arrest
that
would
follow
the
sensational
newspaper
reports
of
the
defalcation
of
carper
harris
confidential
clerk
of
the
great
wholesale
house
of
beaumont
milton
company
the
newspapers
would
assume
his
guilt
as
they
always
do
when
one
is
charged
with
crime
they
would
speak
of
him
as
a
defaulter
and
would
comment
on
the
story
as
an
ingenious
defence
emanating
from
his
shrewd
counsel
even
the
newsboys
on
the
street
would
convict
him
with
the
cry
of
all
about
the
trial
of
the
great
defaulter
the
jury
its
very
self
when
it
went
into
the
box
would
be
going
there
to
try
a
man
already
convicted
of
crime
this
conviction
would
have
been
forced
upon
them
by
the
reports
and
they
could
not
entirely
escape
from
it
no
matter
how
hard
they
might
try
why
if
one
of
them
should
be
asked
suddenly
what
he
was
doing
in
all
possibility
if
he
should
reply
without
stopping
to
think
he
would
answer
that
he
was
trying
the
man
who
had
robbed
beaumont
milton
company
so
that
way
was
barred
and
it
was
a
demon
with
a
flaming
sword
that
kept
it
the
man
arose
and
began
to
pace
the
floor
he
could
not
go
back
and
tell
the
truth
what
other
thing
could
he
do
it
was
useless
to
inform
the
police
that
would
simply
precipitate
the
storm
it
would
be
going
by
another
path
the
same
way
which
he
had
convinced
himself
was
so
effectually
blocked
nor
did
he
dare
to
remain
silent
the
loss
would
soon
be
discovered
and
then
his
silence
would
convict
him
while
flight
was
open
confession
of
the
crime
carper
harris
had
one
brother
living
in
new
york
a
sort
of
black
sheep
of
the
family
who
had
left
home
when
a
child
to
hazard
his
fortunes
with
the
cattle
exporters
the
family
had
attempted
to
control
him
but
without
avail
he
had
shifted
around
the
in
baltimore
and
had
gone
finally
to
new
york
and
was
now
a
commission
merchant
with
an
office
in
jersey
city
the
relation
between
this
man
and
the
family
had
been
somewhat
strained
but
now
in
the
face
of
this
dreaded
disaster
harris
felt
that
he
was
the
only
one
to
appeal
to
not
that
he
hoped
that
his
brother
could
render
him
any
assistance
but
because
he
must
consult
with
some
one
and
this
man
was
after
all
the
only
human
being
whom
he
could
trust
he
hastily
scribbled
a
note
and
calling
a
messenger
sent
it
to
his
brother
hotel
then
he
threw
himself
down
on
the
bed
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
what
diabolical
patience
and
cunning
fate
sometimes
exhibits
all
the
good
fortune
which
had
come
to
young
harris
seemed
to
have
been
only
for
the
purpose
of
smoothing
the
way
into
this
trap
ii
what
is
wrong
here
carper
said
william
harris
as
he
shut
the
door
behind
him
i
expected
to
find
a
corpse
from
the
tone
of
your
note
what
up
the
commission
merchant
was
a
short
heavy
young
man
with
a
big
square
jaw
and
keen
gray
eyes
his
face
indicated
tenacity
and
unlimited
courage
of
the
sterner
sort
carper
harris
arose
when
his
brother
entered
he
was
as
white
as
the
dead
william
he
said
i
wish
i
were
a
corpse
ho
ho
cried
the
dropping
into
a
chair
there
is
a
big
on
the
track
that
is
evident
which
is
gone
your
girl
or
your
job
brother
continued
carper
harris
i
am
in
a
more
horrible
position
than
you
can
imagine
i
do
know
whether
you
will
believe
me
or
not
but
if
you
do
no
one
will
you
may
be
a
fool
carper
answered
the
commission
merchant
closing
his
hands
on
the
arms
of
his
chair
but
you
are
not
a
liar
go
on
tell
me
the
whole
thing
carper
harris
drew
up
a
chair
to
the
table
and
began
to
go
over
the
whole
affair
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
as
he
proceeded
the
muscles
of
his
brother
face
grew
more
and
more
rigid
until
they
looked
as
hard
and
as
firm
as
a
cast
when
he
finally
finished
and
dropped
back
into
his
chair
the
arose
and
without
a
word
went
over
to
the
window
and
stood
looking
out
over
the
city
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
there
was
no
indication
by
which
one
could
have
known
of
the
bitter
struggle
going
on
in
the
man
bosom
unless
one
could
have
looked
deep
into
his
eyes
there
the
danger
and
despair
which
he
realized
as
attendant
upon
this
matter
shone
through
in
a
kind
of
fierce
glare
finally
he
turned
round
and
looked
down
half
smilingly
at
his
brother
well
carper
he
said
is
that
all
the
trouble
we
can
fix
that
all
right
how
almost
screamed
young
harris
bounding
to
his
feet
how
the
commission
merchant
came
back
leisurely
to
his
chair
and
sat
down
his
features
were
composed
and
wore
an
air
of
pleasant
assurance
my
boy
he
began
this
is
tough
lines
to
be
sure
but
you
are
worth
a
of
convicts
yet
sit
down
then
and
i
will
straighten
this
thing
out
in
a
jiffy
i
have
been
devilish
lucky
this
season
and
i
now
have
about
sixteen
thousand
dollars
in
bank
you
have
i
happen
to
know
some
five
thousand
dollars
in
securities
which
came
to
you
out
of
father
estate
when
it
was
settled
turn
these
securities
over
to
me
and
go
right
on
to
europe
as
you
intended
i
will
realize
on
the
securities
and
with
the
money
i
now
have
will
be
enabled
to
purchase
the
exchange
which
you
require
and
will
have
it
sent
to
you
immediately
so
there
will
be
no
delay
you
can
go
right
on
with
your
business
as
you
intended
and
neither
old
beaumont
nor
any
other
living
skinflint
will
ever
know
of
this
robbery
carper
harris
could
not
speak
his
emotion
choked
him
he
seized
his
brother
hand
and
wrung
it
in
silence
while
the
tears
streamed
down
his
face
come
come
said
the
this
wo
do
brace
up
i
am
simply
lending
you
the
money
you
can
return
it
if
you
ever
get
able
if
you
do
why
it
came
easy
and
i
wo
ever
miss
the
loss
of
it
may
god
bless
you
brother
stammered
carper
harris
you
have
saved
me
from
the
very
grave
and
what
is
more
from
the
stigma
of
a
felon
you
shall
not
lose
this
money
by
me
i
will
repay
it
if
heaven
spares
my
life
do
go
on
like
a
carper
said
the
rising
and
turning
to
the
door
pull
yourself
together
gather
up
your
duds
and
skip
out
to
london
the
stuff
will
be
there
by
the
time
you
are
ready
for
it
then
he
went
out
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
iii
i
had
to
lie
to
him
said
william
harris
there
was
no
other
way
out
of
it
i
knew
it
was
the
only
means
by
which
i
could
get
him
out
of
the
country
if
he
stayed
here
they
would
nab
him
and
put
him
in
the
penitentiary
in
spite
of
the
very
devil
himself
it
is
all
very
well
to
talk
about
justice
and
all
that
rot
but
a
young
man
in
that
kind
of
a
position
would
have
about
as
much
show
as
a
snowball
in
vesuvius
the
best
thing
to
do
was
to
put
him
over
the
pond
and
the
next
thing
was
to
come
here
i
did
both
now
what
is
to
be
done
it
is
evident
said
randolph
mason
that
the
young
man
is
the
victim
of
one
of
our
numerous
gangs
of
train
robbers
and
it
is
quite
as
evident
that
it
is
utterly
impossible
to
recover
the
stolen
money
the
thing
to
be
done
is
to
shift
the
loss
shift
the
loss
sir
echoed
the
i
do
believe
that
i
quite
catch
your
meaning
sir
said
mason
the
law
of
is
the
great
law
governing
the
actions
of
men
all
other
considerations
are
of
a
secondary
nature
the
selfish
interest
is
the
great
motive
power
it
is
the
natural
instinct
to
seek
vicarious
atonement
men
do
not
bear
a
hurt
if
the
hurt
can
be
placed
upon
another
it
is
a
bitter
law
but
it
is
nevertheless
a
law
as
fixed
as
gravity
i
see
said
the
commission
merchant
but
how
is
this
loss
to
be
shifted
on
any
one
the
money
is
gone
for
good
there
is
no
way
to
get
it
back
and
there
is
no
means
by
which
we
can
switch
the
responsibility
to
the
shoulders
of
any
other
person
the
money
was
placed
in
carper
harris
custody
he
was
instructed
to
use
great
care
in
order
to
prevent
any
possible
loss
he
left
baltimore
with
it
the
story
of
his
robbery
would
only
render
him
ridiculous
if
it
were
urged
in
his
behalf
he
alone
is
responsible
for
the
money
there
is
no
way
to
shift
it
i
said
sir
growled
mason
that
the
loss
must
be
shifted
what
does
the
responsibility
matter
provided
the
burden
of
loss
can
be
placed
upon
other
shoulders
how
much
money
have
you
only
the
five
thousand
dollars
which
i
received
from
the
sale
of
his
securities
answered
the
man
the
story
which
i
told
him
about
the
sixteen
thousand
was
all
a
lie
i
have
scarcely
a
thousand
dollars
to
my
name
all
told
mason
looked
at
the
and
smiled
grimly
so
far
you
have
done
well
he
said
it
seems
that
you
must
be
the
instrument
through
which
this
cunning
game
of
fate
is
to
be
blocked
you
are
the
strong
one
therefore
the
burden
must
fall
on
your
shoulders
are
you
ready
to
bear
the
brunt
of
this
battle
i
am
said
the
man
quietly
the
boy
must
be
saved
if
i
have
to
go
to
sing
sing
for
the
next
twenty
years
iv
the
traveller
crossing
the
continent
in
a
pullman
car
is
convinced
that
west
virginia
is
one
continuous
mountain
he
has
no
desire
to
do
other
than
to
hurry
past
with
all
the
rapidity
of
which
the
iron
horse
is
capable
he
can
have
no
idea
that
in
its
central
portion
is
a
stretch
of
rolling
country
as
fertile
and
as
valuable
as
the
lands
of
kentucky
with
a
civilization
too
distinctly
its
own
and
not
to
be
met
with
in
any
other
country
of
the
world
it
seems
to
combine
queerly
enough
certain
of
the
elements
of
the
virginia
planter
the
western
ranchman
and
the
feudal
baron
perhaps
nowhere
in
any
of
the
united
states
can
be
found
such
decided
traces
of
the
ancient
feudal
system
as
in
this
inland
basin
of
west
virginia
surrounded
by
great
mountain
ranges
and
for
many
generations
cut
off
from
active
relations
with
the
outside
world
nor
is
this
civilization
of
any
other
than
natural
growth
in
the
beginning
those
who
came
to
this
region
were
colonial
families
of
degree
many
of
them
tories
hating
washington
and
his
government
and
staunch
lovers
of
the
king
at
heart
for
whom
the
more
closely
settled
east
and
south
were
too
unpleasant
after
the
success
of
the
revolution
many
of
them
found
in
this
fertile
land
lying
against
the
and
difficult
of
access
from
either
the
east
or
west
the
seclusion
and
the
utter
absence
of
relations
with
their
fellows
which
they
so
much
desired
with
them
they
brought
certain
feudal
customs
as
a
basis
for
the
civilization
which
they
builded
the
nature
of
the
country
forced
upon
them
others
and
the
desire
for
gain
ever
large
in
the
heart
brought
in
still
other
customs
foreign
and
incongruous
thus
it
happened
that
at
an
early
day
this
country
was
divided
into
great
tracts
containing
thousands
of
acres
of
grass
lands
owned
by
certain
powerful
families
who
resided
upon
it
and
to
a
very
large
extent
preserved
ancient
customs
and
ancient
ideas
in
relation
to
men
the
idea
of
a
centrally
situated
was
one
adhered
to
from
the
very
first
and
this
differed
from
the
virginia
manor
in
that
it
was
more
massive
and
seemed
to
be
built
with
the
desire
of
strength
predominating
as
though
the
builder
had
yet
in
mind
a
vague
notion
of
baronial
defences
and
some
half
hope
or
half
fear
of
grim
fights
in
which
he
and
his
henchmen
would
defend
against
the
invader
gradually
after
the
feudal
custom
the
owner
of
one
of
these
great
tracts
gathered
about
him
a
colony
of
tenants
and
retainers
who
looked
after
his
stock
and
grew
to
be
almost
fixtures
of
the
realty
and
partook
in
no
degree
of
the
shiftless
qualities
of
the
modern
tenant
they
were
attached
to
the
family
of
the
master
of
the
estate
and
shared
in
his
peculiarities
and
his
prejudices
his
quarrel
became
their
own
and
personal
conflicts
between
the
retainers
of
different
landowners
were
not
infrequent
at
such
times
if
the
breaches
of
the
peace
were
of
such
a
violent
order
as
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
law
the
master
was
in
honor
bound
to
shield
his
men
as
far
as
possible
and
usually
his
influence
was
sufficient
to
preserve
them
from
punishment
indeed
it
was
the
landowner
and
his
people
against
the
world
they
were
different
from
the
virginians
in
that
they
were
more
aggressive
and
powerful
and
were
of
a
more
adventurous
and
hardy
nature
they
were
never
content
to
be
mere
farmers
or
to
depend
upon
the
cultivation
of
the
soil
nor
were
they
careful
enough
to
become
breeders
of
fine
stock
for
these
reasons
it
came
about
that
they
adopted
a
certain
kind
of
stock
business
combining
the
qualities
of
the
ranch
and
the
farm
they
bought
in
the
autumn
great
herds
of
cattle
picking
them
up
along
the
borders
of
virginia
and
kentucky
these
cattle
they
brought
over
the
mountains
in
the
fall
fed
them
through
the
winter
and
turned
them
out
in
the
spring
to
fatten
on
their
great
tracts
of
pasture
land
in
the
summer
this
stock
was
shipped
to
the
eastern
market
and
sold
in
favorable
competition
with
the
stock
of
the
west
and
the
cattle
of
virginia
and
pennsylvania
as
this
business
grew
the
little
farmer
along
the
border
began
to
breed
the
finer
grades
of
stock
this
the
great
landowners
encouraged
and
as
the
breeds
grew
better
the
stock
put
upon
the
market
from
this
region
became
more
valuable
until
at
length
the
region
of
west
virginia
has
become
famous
for
its
beef
cattle
and
for
many
years
its
cattle
have
been
almost
entirely
purchased
by
the
exporters
for
the
liverpool
market
so
famous
have
the
cattle
of
certain
of
these
great
landowners
become
that
each
season
the
exporters
send
men
to
buy
the
stock
and
not
infrequently
contract
for
it
from
year
to
year
often
a
landowner
in
whom
the
speculative
spirit
is
rife
will
buy
up
the
cattle
and
make
great
contracts
with
the
exporter
or
he
will
form
a
partnership
with
an
eastern
commission
merchant
and
ship
with
the
market
the
risks
taken
in
this
business
are
great
and
often
vast
sums
of
money
are
made
or
lost
in
a
week
it
is
a
hazardous
kind
of
gambling
for
the
reason
that
great
amounts
are
involved
and
the
slightest
fall
in
the
market
will
often
result
in
big
loss
with
the
shipping
feature
of
this
business
have
grown
certain
customs
sometimes
partnerships
will
be
formed
to
continue
for
one
or
more
weeks
and
for
the
purpose
of
shipping
one
drove
of
cattle
or
a
number
of
droves
and
when
the
shippers
are
well
known
the
cattle
are
not
paid
for
until
the
shipper
returns
from
the
market
it
being
presumed
that
he
would
not
carry
in
bank
sufficient
money
to
pay
for
a
large
drove
it
is
a
business
containing
all
the
peril
and
excitement
of
the
stock
exchange
and
all
its
fascinating
hope
of
gain
as
well
as
its
dreaded
possibility
of
utter
ruin
often
in
a
grimy
caboose
at
the
end
of
a
slow
freight
train
is
as
true
and
fearless
a
devotee
of
fortune
and
as
reckless
a
plunger
as
one
would
find
in
the
pit
on
wall
street
and
not
infrequently
one
with
as
vast
plans
and
as
heavy
a
stake
in
the
play
as
his
brother
of
the
city
yet
to
look
at
him
big
muscular
and
uncouth
one
would
scarcely
suspect
that
every
week
he
was
juggling
with
values
ranging
from
ten
to
sixty
thousand
dollars
one
monday
morning
of
july
william
harris
a
passenger
on
the
through
louis
express
of
the
baltimore
ohio
said
to
the
conductor
that
he
desired
to
get
off
at
bridgeport
a
small
shipping
station
in
this
region
of
west
virginia
the
conductor
answered
that
his
train
did
not
stop
at
this
station
but
that
as
the
town
was
on
a
grade
at
the
mouth
of
a
tunnel
he
would
slow
up
sufficiently
for
harris
to
jump
off
if
he
desired
to
assume
the
risk
this
harris
concluded
to
do
and
accordingly
as
the
train
ran
by
the
long
open
platform
beside
the
cattle
pens
he
swung
himself
down
from
the
steps
of
the
car
and
jumped
the
platform
was
wet
and
as
harris
struck
the
planks
his
feet
slipped
and
he
would
have
fallen
forward
directly
under
the
wheels
of
the
coach
had
it
not
been
that
a
big
man
standing
near
by
sprang
forward
and
dragged
him
back
you
had
a
damned
close
call
there
my
friend
said
the
big
man
yes
said
harris
picking
himself
up
you
cut
the
undertaker
out
of
a
slight
fee
by
your
quick
work
the
stranger
turned
sharply
when
he
heard
harris
voice
and
grasped
him
by
the
hand
why
billy
he
said
i
did
know
it
was
you
what
are
you
doing
out
here
well
well
said
harris
shaking
the
man
hand
vigorously
there
is
a
god
in
israel
sure
you
are
the
very
man
i
am
looking
for
woodford
thomas
woodford
was
a
powerfully
built
man
big
and
muscular
as
an
ox
he
was
about
forty
a
man
of
property
and
a
known
through
the
whole
country
as
a
daring
speculator
of
almost
phenomenal
success
his
plans
were
often
gigantic
and
his
very
rashness
seemed
to
be
the
means
by
which
good
fortune
heaped
its
favors
upon
him
he
was
in
good
humor
this
morning
the
reports
from
the
foreign
markets
were
favorable
and
indications
seemed
to
insure
the
probability
of
a
decidedly
substantial
advance
at
home
he
put
his
big
hand
upon
arm
and
fairly
led
him
down
the
platform
what
is
up
billy
he
asked
lowering
his
voice
in
my
opinion
answered
harris
the
big
combine
among
the
exporters
is
going
to
burst
and
go
up
higher
than
gilderoy
kite
and
if
we
can
get
over
to
new
york
in
time
we
will
have
the
world
by
the
tail
exclaimed
the
dropping
his
hands
it
will
be
every
man
for
himself
and
they
will
have
to
pay
whatever
we
ask
but
we
must
get
over
there
this
week
next
week
everything
that
wears
hoofs
will
be
dumped
into
jersey
city
come
over
to
the
hotel
and
let
us
hold
a
council
of
war
the
two
men
crossed
the
railroad
track
and
entered
the
little
which
bore
the
and
euphonious
title
of
hotel
holloway
they
went
directly
up
the
steps
and
into
a
small
room
in
the
front
of
the
building
overlooking
the
railroad
here
woodford
locked
the
door
pulled
off
his
coat
and
took
a
large
chew
of
tobacco
it
was
his
way
of
preparing
to
wrestle
with
an
emergency
a
kind
of
mechanical
means
of
forcing
his
faculties
to
a
focus
now
billy
he
said
how
is
the
best
way
to
begin
harris
drew
up
his
chair
beside
the
bed
on
which
his
companion
had
seated
himself
the
situation
is
in
this
kind
of
shape
he
began
the
exporters
have
all
the
ships
chartered
and
expect
ball
holstein
to
furnish
the
cattle
for
next
week
shipments
i
believe
that
old
ball
will
kick
out
of
the
combine
and
tell
the
other
exporters
in
the
trust
that
they
may
go
to
the
devil
for
their
cattle
you
know
what
kind
of
a
panic
this
will
cause
the
space
on
the
boats
has
been
chartered
and
paid
for
and
it
would
be
a
great
loss
to
let
it
stand
empty
nor
could
they
ship
the
common
stock
on
the
market
all
these
men
have
foreign
contracts
made
in
advance
and
calling
for
certain
heavy
grades
of
stock
and
they
are
under
contract
to
furnish
a
certain
specified
number
of
bullocks
each
week
they
formed
the
combine
in
order
to
avoid
difficulties
and
have
depended
on
a
pool
of
all
the
stock
contracted
for
by
the
several
firms
out
of
which
they
could
fill
their
boats
when
the
supply
should
happen
to
be
short
or
the
market
temporarily
high
the
foreign
market
is
rising
and
the
old
man
is
dead
sure
to
hold
on
to
the
good
thing
in
his
clutches
i
was
so
firmly
convinced
that
the
combine
was
going
to
pieces
that
i
at
once
jumped
on
the
first
train
west
and
hurried
here
to
see
you
the
exporters
must
fill
their
contracts
no
matter
what
happens
if
old
ball
kicks
over
as
he
is
sure
to
do
the
market
will
sail
against
the
sky
we
will
have
them
on
the
hip
if
we
can
get
the
export
cattle
into
new
york
but
we
have
no
time
to
lose
these
cattle
must
be
bought
and
carred
here
do
you
understand
me
yes
said
the
striking
his
clenched
right
hand
into
the
palm
of
his
left
it
is
going
to
be
quick
work
but
we
can
do
it
or
my
name
is
not
woodford
we
must
have
at
least
twelve
carloads
of
big
export
cattle
continued
harris
not
one
to
weigh
less
than
sixteen
hundred
pounds
they
must
be
good
now
where
can
you
get
them
quickest
well
answered
the
shipper
thoughtfully
old
ralph
izzard
has
the
best
drove
but
he
wants
five
cents
for
them
and
that
is
steep
too
steep
no
said
harris
that
is
all
right
if
they
are
good
we
have
no
time
to
run
over
the
country
to
hunt
them
up
if
these
are
the
right
kind
we
will
not
stand
on
his
price
you
can
stake
your
soul
on
them
being
the
right
kind
billy
answered
the
enthusiastically
izzard
picked
them
out
of
a
drove
of
at
least
a
thousand
last
fall
and
he
has
looked
after
the
brutes
and
pampered
them
like
pet
cats
they
will
go
over
sixteen
hundred
every
one
of
them
and
they
are
as
fat
as
hogs
and
as
broad
on
the
backs
as
a
bed
i
could
slip
out
to
his
place
and
buy
them
and
have
them
here
in
time
to
car
if
you
think
we
can
give
the
old
man
his
price
they
will
bring
six
and
a
half
in
new
york
and
go
like
hot
cakes
said
harris
but
you
will
have
to
get
out
of
this
quick
or
you
may
run
into
a
crowd
of
buyers
from
baltimore
all
right
billy
said
the
rising
and
pulling
on
his
coat
i
will
tackle
the
old
man
we
had
better
go
to
clarksburg
and
there
you
can
lay
low
and
can
come
up
on
the
freight
that
stops
here
for
the
cattle
i
will
go
out
to
izzard
from
there
and
drive
here
by
noon
the
accommodation
will
be
along
in
about
a
half
hour
i
will
go
down
and
order
the
cars
wait
a
moment
woodford
said
harris
we
ought
to
have
some
written
agreement
about
this
business
what
is
the
use
answered
the
shipper
we
will
go
in
even
on
it
but
if
you
want
to
fix
up
a
little
contract
go
ahead
and
i
will
sign
it
by
the
way
old
izzard
is
a
little
closer
than
most
anybody
else
we
may
have
to
pay
him
something
down
i
thought
about
that
said
harris
and
i
brought
some
money
with
me
but
i
did
have
time
to
gather
up
much
i
have
about
six
thousand
dollars
here
can
you
piece
out
with
that
easy
replied
the
shipper
the
old
devil
would
not
have
the
nerve
to
ask
more
than
ten
thousand
down
william
harris
seated
himself
at
the
table
and
drew
up
a
memorandum
of
agreement
between
them
stating
that
they
had
formed
a
partnership
for
the
purpose
of
dealing
in
stock
and
had
put
into
it
ten
thousand
dollars
as
a
partnership
fund
that
they
were
to
share
the
profits
or
losses
equally
between
them
and
that
the
partnership
was
to
continue
for
thirty
days
this
agreement
both
men
signed
and
harris
placed
it
in
his
pocket
then
the
two
men
ordered
the
cattle
cars
for
the
following
day
and
went
to
clarksburg
on
the
evening
train
here
harris
asked
woodford
if
he
should
pay
over
to
him
the
five
thousand
dollars
or
put
it
in
the
bank
to
this
the
replied
that
he
did
not
like
to
take
the
risk
of
carrying
money
over
the
country
and
that
it
would
be
best
to
deposit
it
and
check
it
out
as
it
should
be
needed
woodford
and
harris
went
to
the
bank
the
shipper
drew
five
thousand
dollars
from
his
own
private
account
put
it
with
the
five
thousand
which
harris
handed
him
and
thrust
the
package
of
bills
through
the
window
to
the
teller
how
do
you
wish
to
deposit
this
money
gentlemen
asked
the
officer
i
do
know
hardly
said
the
shipper
turning
to
his
companion
what
do
you
think
about
it
billy
well
said
the
thoughtfully
i
suppose
we
had
better
deposit
it
in
the
firm
name
of
woodford
harris
then
you
can
give
your
checks
that
way
and
they
wont
get
mixed
with
your
private
matters
that
is
right
said
the
put
it
under
the
firm
name
whereupon
the
teller
deposited
the
money
subject
to
the
check
of
woodford
harris
now
billy
continued
woodford
as
they
passed
out
into
the
street
i
will
buy
these
cattle
and
put
them
on
the
train
you
go
down
with
them
i
will
stay
here
and
look
over
the
country
for
another
drove
and
if
you
want
more
telegraph
me
that
suits
me
perfectly
replied
harris
i
must
get
back
to
new
york
and
i
can
wire
you
just
how
matters
stand
the
moment
i
see
the
market
then
the
two
men
shook
hands
and
harris
returned
to
his
hotel
the
following
afternoon
william
harris
went
to
bridgeport
on
the
freight
train
there
he
found
twelve
cars
loaded
with
cattle
marked
woodford
harris
at
grafton
he
hired
a
man
to
go
through
with
the
stock
and
took
the
midnight
express
for
new
york
the
partnership
formed
to
take
advantage
of
the
situation
which
harris
had
so
fluently
described
had
been
brought
about
with
ease
and
expedition
woodford
was
well
known
to
william
harris
he
had
met
him
first
in
baltimore
where
young
harris
was
a
mere
underling
of
one
of
the
great
exporting
firms
afterwards
he
had
seen
him
frequently
in
jersey
city
and
of
late
had
sold
some
stock
for
him
the
whole
transaction
was
in
close
keeping
with
the
customs
of
men
in
this
business
the
confidence
of
one
average
in
another
is
a
matter
of
more
than
passing
wonder
yet
almost
from
time
immemorial
it
has
been
respected
and
instances
are
rare
indeed
where
this
confidence
has
been
betrayed
to
any
degree
perhaps
after
all
the
ancient
theory
that
trust
reposed
breeds
honesty
in
men
has
in
it
a
large
measure
of
truthfulness
and
if
practised
universally
might
result
in
huge
elevation
of
the
race
and
it
may
be
indeed
that
those
who
attempt
to
apply
this
principle
to
the
business
affairs
of
men
are
philanthropists
of
no
little
stature
but
it
is
at
best
a
dangerous
experiment
wherein
the
safeguards
of
society
are
lowered
and
whereby
grievous
wrongs
break
in
and
despoil
the
citizen
to
the
view
of
one
standing
out
from
the
circle
of
things
men
often
present
queer
contradictions
they
call
upon
the
state
to
protect
them
from
the
petty
rogue
and
make
no
effort
to
protect
themselves
from
the
great
one
they
place
themselves
voluntarily
in
positions
of
peril
and
then
cry
out
bitterly
if
by
any
mishap
they
suffer
hurt
from
it
and
fume
and
rail
at
the
law
when
it
is
themselves
they
should
rail
at
the
wonder
is
that
the
average
business
man
is
not
ruined
by
the
rogue
surely
the
ignorance
of
the
knave
will
not
protect
him
always
the
situation
would
seem
to
arise
from
a
false
belief
that
the
protection
of
the
law
is
a
great
shield
covering
at
all
points
against
the
attacks
of
wrong
on
saturday
afternoon
about
three
the
cashier
of
the
fourth
national
bank
in
the
town
of
clarksburg
called
thomas
woodford
as
he
was
passing
on
the
street
and
requested
him
to
come
at
once
into
the
directors
room
woodford
saw
by
the
man
face
that
there
was
something
serious
the
matter
and
he
hurried
after
him
to
the
door
of
the
private
office
as
he
entered
izzard
arose
and
crossed
the
room
to
him
the
old
man
held
a
check
in
his
hand
and
was
evidently
laboring
under
great
excitement
woodford
he
cried
thrusting
the
check
up
into
the
face
this
thing
is
not
worth
a
damn
there
is
no
money
here
to
pay
it
no
money
to
pay
it
echoed
woodford
you
must
be
crazy
we
put
the
money
in
here
monday
there
ten
thousand
dollars
here
to
pay
it
well
said
the
old
man
trembling
with
anger
there
is
none
here
now
you
gave
me
this
check
tuesday
on
my
cattle
which
you
and
harris
bought
and
you
told
me
there
was
money
here
to
meet
it
i
thought
you
were
all
right
of
course
and
i
did
not
come
to
town
until
now
the
cashier
says
there
is
not
a
cursèd
cent
here
to
the
credit
of
you
and
harris
the
blood
faded
out
of
the
face
leaving
him
as
white
as
a
sheet
he
turned
slowly
to
the
cashier
what
became
of
that
money
he
gasped
why
the
officer
replied
it
was
drawn
out
on
the
check
of
yourself
and
harris
did
you
know
about
it
the
check
was
properly
endorsed
show
me
the
check
said
thomas
woodford
striving
hard
to
control
the
trembling
of
his
voice
there
must
be
some
mistake
the
cashier
went
to
his
desk
and
returned
with
a
check
which
he
spread
out
on
the
table
before
the
the
man
seized
it
and
carried
it
to
the
light
where
he
scrutinized
it
closely
it
was
in
proper
form
and
drawn
in
the
firm
name
of
woodford
harris
directing
the
fourth
national
bank
to
pay
to
william
harris
ten
thousand
dollars
it
was
properly
endorsed
by
william
harris
and
bore
the
stamp
of
the
new
york
clearing
house
when
was
this
check
cashed
asked
woodford
it
was
sent
in
yesterday
answered
the
cashier
is
there
anything
wrong
with
it
for
a
time
woodford
did
not
speak
he
stood
with
his
back
to
the
two
men
and
was
evidently
attempting
to
arrive
at
some
solution
of
the
matter
presently
he
turned
and
faced
the
angry
there
has
been
a
mistake
here
izzard
he
said
speaking
slowly
and
calmly
suppose
i
give
you
my
note
for
the
money
the
bank
here
will
discount
it
and
you
will
not
be
put
to
any
inconvenience
to
this
the
old
gentleman
readily
assented
all
i
want
he
assured
the
shipper
is
to
be
safe
your
note
woodford
is
good
for
ten
times
the
sum
thomas
woodford
turned
to
the
desk
and
drew
a
negotiable
note
for
the
amount
of
the
check
this
he
gave
to
izzard
and
then
hurried
to
the
telegraph
office
where
he
wired
harris
asking
for
an
immediate
explanation
of
the
mysterious
transaction
he
was
a
man
accustomed
to
keep
his
own
counsels
and
he
was
not
yet
ready
to
abandon
them
he
gave
directions
where
the
answer
was
to
be
sent
then
he
went
to
the
hotel
locked
himself
in
his
room
and
began
to
pace
the
floor
striving
to
solve
the
enigma
of
this
queer
proceeding
on
the
part
of
william
harris
the
transaction
had
an
ugly
appearance
the
money
had
been
placed
in
the
bank
by
the
two
men
for
the
express
purpose
of
meeting
this
check
which
he
had
given
to
izzard
as
a
part
payment
on
his
stock
harris
knew
this
perfectly
and
had
suggested
it
now
how
should
it
happen
that
he
had
drawn
the
money
in
his
own
name
almost
immediately
upon
his
arrival
in
new
york
could
it
be
that
harris
had
concluded
to
steal
the
money
this
the
refused
to
believe
he
had
known
harris
for
years
and
knew
that
he
was
considered
honest
as
the
world
goes
besides
harris
would
not
dare
to
make
such
a
bold
move
for
the
purpose
of
robbery
his
name
was
on
the
back
of
the
check
there
was
no
apparent
attempt
to
conceal
it
no
there
could
be
but
one
explanation
considered
woodford
harris
had
found
the
market
rising
and
a
great
opportunity
to
make
a
vast
sum
of
money
consequently
he
had
bought
more
stock
and
had
been
compelled
to
use
this
money
for
the
purpose
of
payment
there
could
be
no
other
explanation
so
the
convinced
himself
thomas
woodford
was
not
a
man
of
wavering
decisions
when
his
conclusion
was
once
formed
that
was
the
end
of
it
he
went
over
to
the
bathed
his
face
and
turned
to
leave
the
room
as
he
did
so
some
one
rapped
on
the
door
when
he
opened
it
a
messenger
boy
handed
him
a
telegram
he
took
the
message
closed
the
door
and
went
over
to
the
window
for
a
moment
the
dread
of
what
the
little
yellow
envelope
might
possibly
contain
made
the
big
rough
tremble
then
he
dismissed
the
premonition
as
an
unreasonable
fear
and
with
calm
finger
opened
the
message
the
telegram
was
from
new
york
and
contained
these
few
words
have
been
robbed
everything
is
lost
and
was
signed
william
harris
thomas
woodford
staggered
as
if
some
one
had
dealt
him
a
terrible
blow
in
the
face
the
paper
fell
from
his
fingers
and
fluttered
down
on
the
floor
the
room
appeared
to
swim
round
him
his
heart
thumped
violently
for
a
moment
and
then
seemed
to
die
down
in
his
breast
and
cease
its
beating
he
sank
down
in
his
chair
and
fell
forward
on
the
table
his
big
body
limp
under
the
shock
of
this
awful
calamity
it
was
all
perfectly
plain
to
him
now
the
entire
transaction
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
had
been
a
cunning
plan
to
rob
him
the
checking
out
of
the
ten
thousand
dollars
was
but
a
small
part
of
it
harris
had
sold
the
cattle
and
seeking
to
keep
the
money
had
simply
said
that
he
had
been
robbed
the
story
about
the
probable
dissolution
of
the
combine
had
been
all
a
lie
he
had
been
the
dupe
the
easy
willing
dupe
of
a
cunning
villain
william
harris
had
come
to
west
virginia
with
the
deliberate
intention
of
inveigling
him
into
this
very
trap
he
had
left
new
york
with
the
entire
scheme
well
planned
he
had
stopped
at
bridgeport
and
told
him
the
plausible
story
about
what
would
happen
to
the
combine
in
order
to
arouse
his
interest
and
draw
him
into
the
plot
and
to
account
for
his
own
presence
in
the
cattle
region
it
was
a
shrewdly
constructed
tale
which
under
the
circumstances
the
most
cautious
man
in
the
business
would
have
believed
the
man
winced
as
he
recalled
how
cunningly
harris
had
forced
him
to
do
the
very
things
he
desired
done
without
appearing
to
even
suggest
them
there
was
the
deposit
of
the
fund
in
the
partnership
name
that
seemed
all
reasonable
enough
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
that
this
money
would
then
be
subject
to
harris
check
as
well
as
his
own
then
too
it
was
reasonable
that
he
should
go
out
and
buy
the
cattle
and
harris
ship
them
harris
was
a
by
trade
and
this
division
of
the
work
was
natural
such
a
robbery
had
not
occurred
before
in
all
the
history
of
this
business
and
how
fatally
well
all
the
circumstances
and
the
customs
of
the
trade
fitted
into
the
plan
of
this
daring
rascal
then
like
a
benumbing
ache
came
the
gradual
appreciation
of
the
magnitude
of
this
loss
the
cattle
were
worth
twenty
thousand
dollars
he
had
agreed
to
pay
izzard
that
sum
for
the
drove
and
then
there
was
the
five
thousand
of
his
own
money
thousand
dollars
in
all
it
was
no
small
sum
for
the
wealthiest
to
lose
and
to
this
man
in
his
despair
it
loomed
large
indeed
financial
ruin
is
an
demon
at
best
the
grasp
of
his
hand
is
blighting
the
leer
of
his
sunken
face
maddening
it
requires
strong
will
to
face
the
monster
when
one
knows
that
he
is
coming
even
after
his
shadow
has
been
flitting
across
one
path
for
years
when
he
leaps
down
suddenly
from
the
dark
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
unsuspecting
that
one
must
be
strong
indeed
if
all
that
he
possesses
of
virtue
and
honesty
and
good
motive
be
not
driven
out
from
him
the
old
clock
on
the
struck
five
its
battered
iron
tongue
crying
out
from
above
the
place
where
men
were
accustomed
to
resort
for
justice
the
sound
startled
woodford
and
reminded
him
of
something
he
arose
and
went
to
the
window
and
stood
looking
at
the
gaunt
old
building
yes
there
was
the
law
he
had
almost
forgotten
that
and
the
law
would
not
tolerate
wrong
it
hated
the
and
hunted
him
down
even
to
the
death
and
punished
him
men
were
often
weak
and
half
blind
but
the
law
was
strong
always
and
its
eyes
were
the
world
was
not
so
large
that
the
rogue
could
hide
from
it
in
its
strength
it
would
seek
him
out
and
hold
him
responsible
for
the
evil
he
had
done
it
stood
ever
in
its
majesty
between
the
knave
and
those
upon
whom
he
sought
to
prey
its
shadow
heavy
with
warning
lay
always
before
the
faces
of
vicious
men
in
his
bitterness
woodford
thanked
heaven
that
this
was
true
from
the
iron
hand
of
the
law
william
harris
should
have
vengeance
visited
upon
him
to
the
very
rim
of
the
measure
vi
randolph
mason
looked
up
from
his
desk
as
william
harris
burst
into
his
office
the
face
was
red
and
he
was
panting
with
excitement
mason
he
cried
there
is
trouble
on
foot
you
must
help
me
out
trouble
echoed
mason
is
it
any
new
thing
to
meet
why
do
you
come
back
with
your
petty
matters
it
is
no
petty
matter
sir
said
harris
you
planned
the
whole
thing
for
me
and
you
said
it
was
no
crime
now
they
are
trying
to
put
me
in
the
penitentiary
you
must
have
been
wrong
when
you
said
it
was
no
crime
wrong
said
mason
sharply
what
fool
says
i
am
wrong
why
sir
continued
harris
rapidly
thomas
woodford
has
applied
to
the
governor
for
an
extradition
asking
that
i
be
turned
over
to
the
authorities
of
west
virginia
on
the
charge
of
having
committed
a
felony
you
said
i
could
draw
out
the
partnership
fund
and
keep
it
and
that
i
could
sell
the
cattle
and
buy
foreign
exchange
with
the
money
and
it
would
be
no
crime
now
they
are
after
me
and
you
must
go
to
albany
and
see
about
it
i
shall
not
go
to
albany
said
mason
you
have
committed
no
crime
and
can
not
be
punished
but
said
harris
anxiously
wo
they
take
me
down
there
wo
the
governor
turn
me
over
to
them
the
governor
continued
mason
is
no
fool
the
affidavit
stating
the
facts
which
must
accompany
the
application
will
show
on
its
face
that
no
crime
has
been
committed
you
were
a
partner
with
a
control
of
the
funds
the
taking
of
partnership
property
by
one
partner
is
no
crime
neither
did
you
steal
the
cattle
they
were
sold
to
you
your
partner
trusted
you
if
you
do
not
pay
it
is
his
misfortune
it
was
all
a
business
affair
and
by
no
possible
construction
can
be
twisted
into
a
crime
nor
does
it
matter
how
the
partnership
was
formed
so
that
it
existed
it
is
no
crime
to
lie
in
regard
to
an
opinion
you
have
violated
no
law
you
have
simply
taken
advantage
of
its
weak
places
to
your
own
gain
and
to
the
hurt
of
certain
stupid
fools
the
attorney
general
will
never
permit
an
extradition
in
this
case
while
the
world
stands
go
home
man
and
sleep
you
are
as
safe
from
the
law
as
though
you
were
in
the
grave
with
that
randolph
mason
arose
and
opened
the
office
door
i
bid
you
sir
he
said
curtly
the
governor
of
new
york
pushed
the
papers
across
the
table
to
the
attorney
general
i
would
like
you
to
look
at
this
application
for
the
extradition
of
one
harris
charged
with
committing
a
felony
in
the
state
of
west
virginia
he
said
the
paper
seems
to
be
regular
but
i
am
somewhat
in
doubt
as
to
the
proper
construction
to
be
placed
upon
the
affidavit
stating
the
facts
alleged
to
constitute
this
crime
vii
the
attorney
general
took
the
papers
and
went
over
them
rapidly
well
he
said
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
application
everything
is
regular
except
the
affidavit
and
it
is
quite
clear
that
it
fails
to
support
this
charge
of
felony
i
was
inclined
to
that
opinion
said
the
governor
and
i
thought
best
to
submit
the
matter
to
you
it
is
usual
continued
the
attorney
general
to
grant
the
application
without
question
where
the
papers
are
regular
and
the
crime
is
charged
and
it
is
not
required
that
the
crime
be
charged
with
the
legal
exactness
necessary
in
an
indictment
the
governor
is
not
permitted
to
try
the
question
whether
the
accused
is
guilty
or
not
guilty
nor
is
he
to
be
controlled
by
the
question
whether
the
offence
is
or
is
not
a
crime
in
his
own
state
the
question
before
him
being
whether
the
act
is
punishable
as
a
crime
in
the
demanding
state
the
governor
can
not
go
behind
the
face
of
the
papers
nor
behind
the
facts
alleged
to
constitute
a
crime
and
if
these
facts
by
any
reasonable
construction
support
the
charge
of
crime
the
extradition
will
usually
be
granted
but
it
is
a
solemn
proceeding
and
one
not
to
be
trifled
with
and
not
to
be
invoked
without
good
cause
nor
to
be
used
for
the
purpose
of
redressing
civil
injuries
or
for
the
purpose
of
harassing
the
citizens
and
where
on
the
face
of
the
affidavit
it
is
plainly
evident
that
no
crime
has
been
committed
and
that
by
no
possible
construction
of
the
facts
stated
could
the
matter
be
punishable
as
a
crime
then
it
is
the
duty
of
the
governor
to
refuse
the
extradition
in
this
case
the
authorities
in
the
demanding
state
have
filed
an
affidavit
setting
forth
at
length
the
facts
alleged
to
constitute
a
felony
this
paper
shows
substantially
that
a
general
partnership
was
formed
by
william
harris
and
thomas
woodford
and
that
pursuant
to
such
business
relations
certain
partnership
property
came
into
the
possession
of
harris
this
property
he
converted
to
his
own
use
it
is
clear
that
this
act
constituted
no
crime
under
the
statutes
of
west
virginia
or
the
common
law
there
obtaining
the
property
was
general
partnership
property
the
money
taken
was
a
general
partnership
fund
subject
to
the
check
of
either
partner
the
partner
harris
was
properly
in
possession
of
the
cattle
as
a
part
owner
he
was
also
lawfully
entitled
to
the
possession
of
the
partnership
fund
if
he
saw
fit
to
draw
it
out
and
use
it
if
it
be
presumed
that
his
story
of
the
robbery
is
false
and
that
he
deliberately
planned
to
secure
possession
of
the
property
and
money
and
did
so
secure
possession
of
it
and
converted
it
to
his
own
use
yet
he
has
committed
no
crime
he
has
simply
taken
advantage
of
the
trust
reposed
in
him
by
his
partner
woodford
and
has
done
none
of
those
acts
essential
to
a
felony
the
application
must
be
refused
that
was
my
opinion
said
the
governor
but
such
a
great
wrong
had
been
done
that
i
hesitated
to
refuse
the
extradition
yes
answered
the
attorney
general
all
the
wrong
of
a
serious
felony
has
been
done
but
no
crime
has
been
committed
the
machinery
of
criminal
jurisprudence
can
not
be
used
for
the
purpose
of
redressing
civil
wrong
the
distinction
being
that
by
a
fiction
of
law
crimes
are
wrongs
against
the
state
and
in
order
to
be
a
crime
the
offence
must
be
one
of
those
wrongs
described
by
the
law
as
being
against
the
peace
and
dignity
of
the
state
if
on
the
other
hand
the
act
be
simply
a
wrong
to
the
citizen
and
not
of
the
class
described
as
being
offences
against
the
state
it
is
no
crime
no
matter
how
injurious
it
may
be
or
how
wrongful
to
the
individual
the
entire
transaction
was
a
civil
matter
resulting
in
injury
to
the
citizen
woodford
but
it
is
no
crime
and
is
not
the
proper
subject
of
an
extradition
the
governor
turned
around
in
his
chair
james
he
said
to
his
private
secretary
return
the
application
for
the
extradition
of
william
harris
and
say
that
upon
the
face
of
the
papers
it
is
plainly
evident
that
no
crime
has
been
committed
the
blow
which
fate
had
sought
to
deliver
with
such
malicious
cunning
against
the
confidential
clerk
of
beaumont
milton
company
had
been
turned
aside
and
had
fallen
with
all
its
crushing
weight
upon
the
shoulders
of
another
man
five
hundred
miles
to
westward
within
the
jurisdiction
of
a
distant
commonwealth
iv
the
error
of
william
van
broom
the
lawyer
will
at
once
see
that
the
false
making
of
this
paper
is
no
forgery
and
that
no
crime
has
been
committed
see
the
virginia
case
of
foulke
in
robinson
virginia
reports
the
case
of
jackson
weisiger
monroe
reports
and
the
later
case
of
charles
waterman
vs
the
people
i
the
morning
paper
contained
this
extravagant
personal
do
not
suicide
if
you
are
a
of
new
york
in
difficulty
at
nine
walk
east
by
the
corner
of
the
building
with
a
copy
of
this
paper
in
your
right
hand
the
conservative
foreigner
unfamiliar
with
our
great
dailies
would
perhaps
be
surprised
that
the
editor
would
print
such
a
questionable
announcement
in
his
paper
but
at
this
time
in
new
york
the
personal
column
had
become
a
very
questionable
directory
resorted
to
by
all
classes
of
mankind
for
every
conceivable
purpose
be
it
gain
adventure
or
even
crime
no
one
thought
to
question
the
propriety
of
such
publications
indeed
no
one
stopped
to
consider
them
at
all
unless
he
happened
to
be
a
party
in
interest
ii
a
few
minutes
before
the
hour
mentioned
in
the
above
personal
a
cab
came
rattling
down
street
the
driver
wore
a
and
a
buttoned
up
around
his
ears
as
he
turned
the
corner
to
the
building
he
glanced
down
at
his
front
wheel
and
brought
his
horses
up
with
a
jerk
there
was
evidently
something
wrong
with
the
wheel
for
he
jumped
down
from
the
box
to
examine
it
he
shook
the
wheel
took
off
the
tap
and
began
to
move
the
hub
carefully
out
toward
the
end
of
the
axle
as
he
worked
he
kept
his
eyes
on
the
corner
presently
a
big
plainly
dressed
man
walked
slowly
down
by
the
building
he
carried
a
newspaper
in
his
right
hand
and
seemed
to
be
keeping
a
sharp
lookout
around
him
he
stopped
for
a
moment
by
the
carriage
satisfied
himself
that
it
was
empty
and
went
on
at
the
next
corner
he
climbed
up
on
the
seat
of
the
waiting
patrol
wagon
and
disappeared
the
cabman
seemed
to
be
engrossed
with
the
repair
of
his
wheel
and
gave
no
indication
that
he
had
seen
the
stranger
almost
immediately
thereafter
a
second
man
passed
the
corner
with
a
newspaper
in
prominent
evidence
he
was
a
hobo
of
the
most
pronounced
type
and
marched
by
with
great
difficulty
after
he
had
passed
he
turned
round
and
threw
the
newspaper
into
the
gutter
with
a
volley
of
curses
the
cabman
worked
on
at
his
wheel
he
had
now
removed
it
to
the
end
of
the
axle
and
was
scraping
the
boxing
with
his
knife
at
this
moment
a
young
man
wearing
a
gray
overcoat
and
a
gray
slouch
hat
came
rapidly
down
the
street
at
the
corner
he
put
his
hand
quickly
into
his
overcoat
pocket
took
out
a
newspaper
and
immediately
thrust
it
into
his
other
pocket
the
cabman
darted
across
the
street
and
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
the
man
turned
with
a
quick
nervous
start
the
cabman
took
off
his
cap
said
something
in
a
low
tone
and
pointed
to
his
wheel
the
two
men
crossed
to
the
carriage
the
cabman
held
the
axle
and
the
stranger
slipped
the
wheel
into
place
while
the
two
talked
in
low
tones
when
it
was
done
the
stranger
turned
round
stepped
up
on
the
pavement
and
hurried
on
by
the
building
the
cabman
shut
his
door
with
a
bang
climbed
up
on
his
box
and
drove
rapidly
down
street
iii
parks
said
randolph
mason
taking
off
his
in
the
private
office
who
wanted
to
see
me
at
this
unusual
hour
he
was
a
philadelphia
man
he
said
sir
answered
the
little
melancholy
clerk
well
said
mason
sharply
did
he
expect
to
die
before
morning
that
i
should
be
sent
for
in
the
middle
of
the
night
he
said
that
he
would
leave
at
six
sir
and
must
see
you
as
soon
as
possible
so
i
thought
i
had
best
send
for
you
he
is
to
be
here
at
ten
you
say
at
ten
sir
answered
the
little
man
going
out
into
the
other
office
and
closing
the
door
behind
him
when
the
door
was
closed
parks
went
over
to
a
corner
of
the
room
took
up
a
hackman
overcoat
and
fur
cap
put
them
into
one
of
the
bookcases
and
locked
the
sliding
top
then
he
went
quietly
out
of
the
room
and
down
the
steps
to
the
entrance
of
the
building
in
the
private
office
randolph
mason
walked
backward
and
forward
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
he
was
restless
and
his
eyes
were
bright
another
weakling
he
muttered
making
puny
efforts
to
escape
from
fate
trap
or
seeking
to
slip
from
under
some
gin
set
by
his
fellows
surely
the
want
of
resources
on
the
part
of
the
race
is
utter
is
abysmal
what
miserable
puppets
men
are
moved
backward
and
forward
in
fate
games
as
though
they
were
strung
on
a
wire
and
had
their
bellies
filled
with
sawdust
yet
each
one
has
his
problem
and
that
is
the
important
matter
in
these
problems
one
pits
himself
against
the
mysterious
intelligence
of
chance
against
the
dread
cunning
and
the
fatal
patience
of
destiny
ah
these
are
worthy
foemen
the
steel
grates
when
one
crosses
swords
with
such
mighty
fencers
there
was
a
sound
as
of
men
conversing
in
low
tones
in
the
outer
office
mason
stopped
short
and
turned
to
the
door
as
he
did
so
the
door
was
opened
from
the
outside
and
a
man
entered
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
remained
standing
with
his
back
against
it
randolph
mason
looked
down
at
the
stranger
sharply
the
man
wore
a
gray
suit
and
gray
overcoat
he
was
about
of
medium
height
with
a
intelligent
face
that
was
peculiar
originally
it
had
expressed
an
indulgent
character
of
unusual
energy
now
it
could
not
be
read
at
all
it
was
simply
that
silent
immobile
mask
so
sought
after
by
the
criminal
his
face
was
white
and
the
perspiration
was
standing
out
on
his
forehead
indicating
that
he
was
laboring
under
some
deep
and
violent
emotion
yet
with
all
his
manner
was
composed
and
deliberate
and
his
face
gave
no
sign
other
than
its
whiteness
it
was
calm
and
expressionless
as
the
face
of
the
dead
randolph
mason
dragged
a
big
chair
up
to
his
desk
sat
down
in
his
office
chair
and
pointed
to
the
other
the
stranger
came
and
sat
down
in
the
big
chair
gripping
its
arms
with
his
hands
and
without
introduction
or
comment
began
to
talk
in
a
jerky
metallic
voice
this
is
all
waste
of
time
he
said
you
wo
help
me
there
is
no
reason
for
my
being
here
i
should
have
had
it
over
by
this
time
and
yet
that
would
not
help
her
and
she
is
the
only
one
it
would
be
the
meanest
kind
of
cowardice
to
leave
her
to
suffer
and
yet
i
dare
not
live
to
see
her
suffer
i
could
not
bear
that
i
love
her
too
much
for
that
i
sir
said
mason
brutally
this
is
all
irrelevant
rant
come
to
the
point
of
your
difficulty
the
stranger
straightened
up
and
passed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
yes
he
said
you
are
right
sir
it
is
all
rant
i
forget
where
i
am
i
will
be
as
brief
and
concise
as
possible
my
name
is
camden
gerard
i
am
a
gambler
by
profession
my
mother
died
when
i
was
about
ten
years
old
and
my
father
then
a
philadelphia
lawyer
found
himself
with
two
children
myself
and
my
little
sister
a
mere
baby
in
arms
he
sent
me
to
one
of
the
eastern
colleges
and
put
the
baby
in
a
convent
thus
things
ran
on
for
perhaps
ten
or
twelve
years
the
evil
effect
of
forcing
me
into
a
big
college
at
an
early
age
soon
became
apparent
i
came
under
the
influence
of
a
rapid
and
unscrupulous
class
and
soon
became
as
rapid
and
unscrupulous
as
the
worst
i
went
all
the
paces
and
gradually
became
an
expert
college
gambler
of
such
high
order
that
i
was
able
to
maintain
myself
at
about
twelve
my
sister
marie
began
to
show
remarkable
talent
as
an
artist
and
my
father
following
her
wishes
took
her
to
paris
and
placed
her
in
one
of
the
best
art
schools
of
that
city
in
a
short
time
thereafter
my
father
died
suddenly
and
it
developed
after
investigation
that
he
had
left
no
estate
whatever
i
sold
the
books
and
other
personal
effects
and
found
myself
adrift
in
the
world
with
a
few
hundred
dollars
no
business
no
profession
and
no
visible
means
of
support
and
further
i
had
this
helpless
child
to
look
after
i
went
to
supposed
friends
of
my
father
and
asked
them
to
help
me
into
some
business
by
which
i
could
maintain
myself
and
my
little
sister
they
promised
but
put
me
off
with
one
excuse
after
another
until
i
finally
saw
through
their
hypocrisy
and
knew
that
they
never
intended
to
assist
me
i
felt
indeed
that
i
was
adrift
utterly
helpless
and
friendless
and
the
result
was
that
i
resorted
to
my
skill
as
a
gambler
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
livelihood
for
a
time
fortune
favored
me
and
i
lived
well
and
paid
all
the
college
expenses
of
marie
i
was
proud
of
the
child
she
was
sweet
and
lovable
and
developing
into
a
remarkably
handsome
girl
about
two
months
ago
my
luck
turned
sharply
against
me
everything
went
wrong
with
long
jumps
night
after
night
i
was
beaten
anybody
broke
me
even
the
i
gathered
together
every
dollar
possible
and
struggled
against
my
bad
fortune
but
to
no
purpose
i
only
lost
night
after
night
in
the
midst
of
all
marie
wrote
to
me
for
money
to
pay
her
quarterly
bills
i
replied
that
i
would
send
it
in
a
short
time
i
pawned
everything
begged
and
borrowed
and
struggled
and
resorted
to
every
trick
and
resource
of
my
craft
but
all
was
utterly
vain
and
useless
i
was
penniless
and
stranded
on
the
heels
of
it
all
i
received
another
letter
from
marie
saying
that
her
bills
must
be
paid
by
the
end
of
the
month
or
they
would
turn
her
out
into
the
city
his
voice
trembled
and
the
perspiration
poured
out
on
his
forehead
you
know
what
it
means
for
a
helpless
young
girl
to
be
turned
out
in
paris
he
went
on
i
know
and
the
thought
of
it
makes
me
insanely
desperate
now
said
the
man
looking
mason
squarely
in
the
eyes
i
have
told
you
all
the
truth
what
am
i
to
do
for
a
time
mason
face
took
on
an
air
of
deep
abstraction
this
is
saturday
night
he
said
as
though
talking
to
himself
you
should
complete
it
by
friday
there
is
time
enough
young
man
he
continued
speaking
clearly
and
precisely
you
are
to
leave
new
york
for
west
virginia
morning
a
messenger
boy
will
meet
you
at
the
train
with
a
package
of
papers
which
i
shall
send
in
it
you
will
find
full
instructions
and
such
things
as
you
will
need
these
instructions
you
are
to
follow
to
the
very
letter
everything
will
depend
on
doing
exactly
as
i
say
but
he
continued
with
positive
and
deliberate
emphasis
this
must
not
fail
the
man
arose
and
drew
a
deep
breath
it
will
not
fail
he
said
i
will
do
anything
to
save
her
from
disgrace
anything
then
he
went
out
at
the
entrance
of
the
building
parks
stepped
up
and
touched
the
stranger
on
the
shoulder
my
friend
he
said
i
will
bring
those
papers
myself
and
i
will
see
that
you
have
sufficient
money
to
carry
this
thing
through
but
remember
that
i
am
not
to
be
trifled
with
you
are
to
come
here
just
as
soon
as
you
return
iv
shortly
before
noon
on
monday
morning
camden
gerard
stepped
into
the
jewelry
establishment
of
william
van
broom
in
the
city
of
wheeling
and
asked
for
the
proprietor
that
gentleman
came
forward
in
no
very
kindly
humor
upon
seeing
the
well
dressed
young
man
he
at
once
concluded
that
he
was
a
jewel
drummer
and
being
a
practical
business
man
he
was
kindly
at
sales
and
surly
at
purchases
this
is
van
broom
i
believe
said
the
young
man
my
name
is
gerard
i
am
from
new
york
sir
then
noticing
the
expression
he
added
quickly
i
am
not
a
salesman
sir
and
am
not
going
to
consume
your
time
i
am
in
west
virginia
on
business
and
stepped
in
here
to
present
a
letter
of
introduction
which
my
friend
bartholdi
insisted
upon
writing
the
affability
of
the
jeweller
returned
with
a
surge
he
bowed
and
beamed
sweetly
as
he
broke
the
seal
of
the
letter
of
introduction
the
paper
bore
the
artistic
stamp
of
bartholdi
and
banks
the
great
diamond
importers
and
ran
as
follows
william
van
broom
wheeling
west
dear
sir
this
will
introduce
camden
gerard
kindly
show
him
every
possible
courtesy
for
which
we
shall
be
under
the
greatest
obligations
most
sincerely
your
obedient
servants
bartholdi
and
banks
the
jeweller
eyes
opened
wide
with
wonder
he
knew
this
firm
to
be
the
largest
and
most
aristocratic
dealers
in
the
world
it
was
much
honor
and
perhaps
vast
benefit
to
be
of
service
to
them
and
he
was
flattered
into
the
seventh
heaven
i
am
indeed
glad
to
meet
you
sir
he
said
seizing
the
man
hand
and
shaking
it
vigorously
i
certainly
hope
that
i
can
be
of
service
it
is
now
near
twelve
you
will
come
with
me
to
lunch
at
the
club
i
thank
you
very
much
answered
camden
gerard
but
i
am
compelled
to
go
to
the
sistersville
oil
field
on
the
noon
train
however
i
will
return
at
eight
and
shall
expect
you
to
dine
with
me
at
the
hotel
the
jeweller
accepted
the
invitation
with
delight
the
young
man
thanked
him
warmly
for
his
kindly
interest
bade
him
and
went
out
that
night
at
eight
camden
gerard
and
william
van
broom
dined
in
the
best
style
the
city
could
afford
the
wine
was
excellent
and
plentiful
and
gerard
proved
to
be
most
entertaining
he
was
brilliant
and
considerate
to
such
a
degree
that
when
the
two
men
parted
for
the
night
the
jeweller
assured
himself
that
he
had
never
met
a
more
delightful
companion
the
following
morning
camden
gerard
dropped
into
the
store
for
a
few
moments
and
while
conversing
with
his
friend
van
broom
noticed
a
little
ring
in
the
show
window
he
remarked
on
its
beauty
and
intimated
that
he
must
purchase
a
birthday
present
for
his
little
daughter
the
jeweller
took
the
ring
from
the
case
and
handed
it
to
gerard
that
gentleman
discovered
that
it
was
far
prettier
than
he
had
at
first
imagined
it
and
inquired
the
price
it
is
marked
at
dollars
said
the
jeweller
why
said
camden
gerard
that
is
very
cheap
i
will
take
it
the
jeweller
wrapped
up
the
ring
and
gave
it
to
the
new
yorker
that
gentleman
paid
the
money
and
returned
to
his
hotel
the
next
day
camden
gerard
was
presumably
down
in
the
great
tyler
county
oil
field
at
any
rate
he
returned
to
the
city
on
the
evening
train
and
dined
with
van
broom
at
the
club
as
the
evening
waned
the
men
grew
confidential
gerard
spoke
of
the
vast
fortunes
that
were
made
in
oil
he
said
that
the
west
virginia
fields
were
scarce
half
developed
but
that
they
had
already
attracted
the
attention
of
the
great
russian
companies
and
that
gigantic
operations
might
be
soon
expected
he
denounced
the
autocratic
policy
of
the
czar
in
regard
to
oil
transportation
and
hinted
vaguely
at
vast
international
combines
he
spoke
of
petersburg
and
the
larger
russian
cities
of
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
nobility
of
their
vast
fortunes
and
their
very
great
desire
to
invest
in
america
he
intimated
vaguely
that
there
now
existed
in
new
york
a
colossal
syndicate
backed
by
unlimited
russian
capital
but
he
gave
the
now
excited
and
curious
jeweller
no
definite
information
concerning
himself
or
his
business
in
west
virginia
shrewdly
leaving
van
broom
to
draw
his
own
inferences
it
was
late
when
william
van
broom
retired
to
his
residence
he
was
happy
and
flattered
and
with
reason
had
he
not
been
selected
by
the
great
firm
of
bartholdi
banks
to
counsel
with
one
who
he
strongly
suspected
was
the
private
agent
of
princes
about
two
on
the
following
thursday
afternoon
camden
gerard
called
upon
william
van
broom
and
said
that
he
wished
to
speak
with
him
in
his
private
office
the
new
yorker
was
soiled
and
grimy
and
had
evidently
just
come
from
a
train
but
he
was
smiling
and
in
high
spirits
when
the
two
men
were
alone
in
the
private
office
camden
gerard
took
a
roll
of
paper
from
his
pocket
and
turned
to
van
broom
here
are
some
papers
he
said
speaking
low
that
he
might
not
be
overheard
i
have
no
secure
place
to
put
them
and
i
would
be
under
great
obligations
to
you
if
you
would
kindly
lock
them
up
in
your
safe
certainly
said
the
jeweller
taking
the
papers
and
crossing
to
the
safe
he
threw
back
the
door
and
pulled
out
one
of
the
little
boxes
it
contained
an
open
leather
case
in
which
there
was
a
magnificent
diamond
necklace
by
george
said
camden
gerard
those
are
splendid
stones
yes
answered
van
broom
taking
out
the
case
and
handing
it
to
the
new
yorker
they
are
too
valuable
for
my
trade
i
am
going
to
return
them
camden
gerard
carried
the
necklace
to
the
light
and
examined
it
critically
the
stones
were
not
large
but
they
were
clear
and
flawless
what
are
these
worth
he
said
turning
to
van
broom
hundred
dollars
answered
the
jeweller
what
cried
gerard
only
hundred
dollars
for
this
necklace
it
is
the
cheapest
thing
i
ever
saw
you
are
away
under
the
foreign
dealers
they
are
cheap
said
van
broom
that
is
almost
the
wholesale
price
but
said
camden
gerard
you
must
be
mistaken
your
mark
is
certainly
wrong
i
have
seen
smaller
stones
in
the
russian
shops
for
double
the
price
we
ca
sell
the
necklace
at
that
figure
said
van
broom
smiling
we
are
not
such
sharks
as
your
foreign
dealers
if
you
mean
that
said
camden
gerard
i
will
buy
these
jewels
here
and
now
i
had
intended
purchasing
something
in
the
east
for
my
wife
but
i
can
never
do
better
than
this
the
new
yorker
took
out
his
and
handed
van
broom
a
bill
before
you
retract
he
said
here
is
fifty
to
seal
the
bargain
get
your
hat
and
come
with
me
to
the
bank
all
right
said
van
broom
taking
the
money
the
necklace
is
yours
my
friend
camden
gerard
closed
the
leather
case
and
put
it
into
his
pocket
the
jeweller
locked
the
safe
put
on
his
hat
and
the
two
went
out
of
the
store
and
down
the
street
to
the
banking
house
of
the
mechanics
trust
company
gerard
enquired
for
the
cashier
the
teller
informed
him
that
the
cashier
was
in
the
back
room
of
the
bank
and
if
he
would
step
back
he
could
see
him
the
new
yorker
asked
his
companion
to
wait
for
a
moment
until
he
spoke
with
the
cashier
then
he
went
back
into
the
room
indicated
by
the
teller
closing
the
door
after
him
the
cashier
sat
at
a
table
engaged
with
a
pile
of
correspondence
he
was
busy
and
looked
up
sharply
as
the
man
entered
sir
said
the
new
yorker
have
you
received
a
sealed
package
from
the
adams
express
company
consigned
to
one
camden
gerard
no
answered
the
cashier
turning
to
his
work
you
have
not
repeated
gerard
excitedly
then
i
will
run
down
to
the
telegraph
office
and
see
what
is
the
matter
thereupon
he
crossed
hurriedly
to
the
side
door
of
the
office
opened
it
and
stepped
out
into
the
street
the
cashier
went
on
with
his
work
for
perhaps
a
quarter
of
an
hour
william
van
broom
waited
for
his
companion
to
conclude
his
business
with
the
cashier
finally
he
grew
impatient
and
asked
the
teller
to
remind
gerard
that
he
was
waiting
the
teller
returned
in
a
moment
and
said
that
the
gentleman
had
gone
to
the
telegraph
office
some
time
ago
the
jeweller
heart
dropped
like
a
lead
plummet
he
turned
without
a
word
and
hurried
to
the
office
of
the
western
union
here
his
fears
were
confirmed
camden
gerard
had
not
been
in
the
office
he
ran
across
the
street
to
the
hotel
and
enquired
for
the
new
yorker
the
clerk
informed
him
that
the
gentleman
had
paid
his
bill
and
left
the
hotel
that
morning
the
jeweller
anxiety
was
at
fever
heat
but
with
all
he
was
a
man
of
business
method
and
knew
the
very
great
value
of
silence
he
called
a
carriage
went
to
the
chief
of
police
and
set
his
machinery
in
motion
returning
to
his
place
of
business
he
opened
the
safe
and
took
out
the
package
of
papers
which
camden
gerard
had
given
him
upon
examination
this
proved
to
be
simply
a
roll
of
blank
oil
leases
then
remembering
the
letter
of
introduction
he
telegraphed
to
bartholdi
banks
hours
passed
and
not
the
slightest
trace
of
camden
gerard
could
be
found
the
presumed
friend
of
the
great
diamond
importers
had
literally
vanished
from
the
face
of
the
earth
about
four
the
jeweller
received
an
answer
from
bartholdi
banks
stating
that
they
knew
no
such
man
as
camden
gerard
and
that
his
letter
of
introduction
was
false

was
white
with
despair
he
put
the
letter
and
answer
into
his
pocket
and
went
at
once
to
the
office
of
the
prosecuting
attorney
for
the
state
and
laid
the
whole
matter
before
him
my
dear
sir
said
that
official
when
van
broom
had
finished
his
story
your
very
good
friend
camden
gerard
owes
you
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
which
he
will
perhaps
continue
to
owe
you
may
as
well
go
back
to
your
business
what
do
you
mean
said
the
jeweller
i
mean
replied
the
attorney
that
you
have
been
the
dupe
of
a
shrewd
knave
who
is
familiar
with
the
weak
places
in
the
law
and
has
resorted
to
an
ingenious
scheme
to
secure
possession
of
your
property
without
rendering
himself
liable
to
criminal
procedure
it
is
true
that
if
the
diamonds
were
located
you
could
attach
and
recover
them
by
a
civil
suit
but
it
is
scarcely
possible
that
such
a
shrewd
knave
would
permit
himself
to
be
caught
with
the
jewels
and
it
is
certain
that
he
has
some
reasonably
safe
method
by
which
he
can
dispose
of
them
without
fear
of
detection
he
has
trapped
you
and
has
committed
no
crime
if
you
had
the
fellow
in
custody
now
the
judge
would
release
him
the
moment
an
application
was
made
the
entire
matter
was
only
a
sale
he
bought
the
jewels
and
you
trusted
him
he
is
no
more
a
than
you
are
he
is
only
a
sharper
dealer
but
sir
cried
the
angry
van
broom
spreading
the
false
letter
out
on
the
table
that
is
forged
every
word
of
it
i
will
send
this
fellow
to
the
penitentiary
for
forgery
i
will
spend
a
thousand
dollars
to
catch
him
if
you
should
spend
a
thousand
dollars
to
catch
him
said
the
attorney
smiling
you
would
never
be
able
to
send
him
to
the
penitentiary
on
that
paper
it
is
not
forgery
not
forgery
shouted
the
jeweller
not
forgery
man
the
rascal
wrote
every
word
of
that
letter
he
signed
the
name
of
bartholdi
banks
at
the
bottom
of
it
every
word
of
that
paper
is
false
the
company
never
heard
of
it
here
is
their
telegram
van
broom
said
the
public
prosecutor
listen
to
me
sir
all
that
you
say
is
perhaps
true
camden
gerard
doubtless
wrote
the
entire
paper
and
signed
the
name
of
bartholdi
banks
and
presented
it
to
you
for
a
definite
purpose
to
such
an
act
men
commonly
apply
the
term
forgery
and
in
the
common
acceptation
of
the
word
it
is
forgery
and
a
reprehensible
wrong
but
legally
the
false
making
of
such
a
paper
as
this
is
not
forgery
and
is
no
crime
in
order
to
constitute
the
crime
of
forgery
the
instrument
falsely
made
must
be
apparently
capable
of
effecting
a
fraud
of
being
used
to
the
prejudice
of
another
right
it
must
be
such
as
might
be
of
legal
efficacy
or
might
be
the
foundation
of
some
legal
liability
this
paper
in
question
although
falsely
made
has
none
of
the
vital
elements
of
forgery
under
the
law
if
genuine
it
would
have
no
legal
validity
as
it
affects
no
legal
rights
it
would
merely
be
an
attempt
to
receive
courtesies
on
a
promise
of
no
legal
obligation
to
reciprocate
them
and
courtesies
have
never
been
held
to
be
the
subject
of
legal
fraud
this
is
a
mere
letter
of
introduction
which
by
no
possibility
could
subject
the
supposed
writer
to
any
pecuniary
loss
or
legal
liability
it
is
not
a
subject
of
forgery
and
its
false
making
is
no
crime
men
commonly
believe
that
all
writings
falsely
made
or
falsely
altered
are
forgeries
there
was
never
a
greater
error
forgery
may
be
committed
only
of
those
instruments
in
writing
which
if
genuine
would
or
might
appear
as
the
foundation
of
another
man
liability
or
the
evidence
of
his
right
all
wrongful
and
injurious
acts
are
not
punished
by
the
law
wrongs
to
become
crimes
must
measure
up
to
certain
definite
and
technical
standards
these
standards
are
laid
down
rigidly
by
the
law
and
can
not
be
contracted
or
expanded
they
are
fixed
and
immutable
the
act
done
must
fit
closely
into
the
prescribed
measure
else
it
is
no
crime
if
it
falls
short
never
so
little
in
any
one
vital
element
the
law
must
and
will
disregard
it
as
criminal
no
matter
how
injurious
or
wrongful
or
unjust
it
may
be
the
law
is
a
rigid
and
exact
science
william
van
broom
dropped
his
hands
to
his
sides
and
gazed
at
the
lawyer
in
wonder
these
facts
continued
the
attorney
in
his
clear
passionless
voice
are
matters
of
amazement
to
the
common
people
when
brought
to
their
attention
they
fail
to
see
the
wise
but
technical
distinctions
they
are
willing
to
trust
to
what
they
are
pleased
to
call
and
falling
into
traps
laid
by
the
cunning
villain
denounce
the
law
for
impotency
well
said
the
jeweller
as
he
arose
and
put
on
his
overcoat
what
is
the
good
of
the
law
anyhow
the
prosecuting
attorney
smiled
wearily
to
him
the
wisdom
of
the
law
was
clear
beautiful
and
superlatively
just
to
the
tradesman
it
was
as
color
to
the
blind
over
in
the
art
school
of
old
monsieur
pontique
marie
gerard
saw
the
result
of
the
entire
matter
in
the
light
of
kindness
and
sweet
and
perhaps
she
saw
it
as
it
was

queer
world

yes
sir
replied
the
bald
little
clerk
it
is
at
cliphmore
i
think
sir
well
said
mason
here
is
his
message
parks
asking
that
i
come
to
him
immediately
it
seems
urgent
and
probably
means
a
will
find
out
what
time
a
train
leaves
the
city
and
have
a
carriage
the
clerk
took
the
telegram
put
on
his
coat
and
went
down
on
the
street
it
was
cold
and
snowing
heavily
the
wind
blew
up
from
the
river
driving
the
snow
in
great
blinding
sheets
the
melancholy
parks
pulled
his
hat
down
over
his
face
walked
slowly
round
the
square
and
came
back
to
the
entrance
of
the
office
building
instead
of
taking
the
elevator
he
went
slowly
up
the
steps
into
the
outer
office
here
he
took
off
his
coat
and
went
over
to
the
window
and
stood
for
some
minutes
looking
out
at
the
white
city
at
any
rate
he
will
not
suspect
me
he
muttered
and
we
must
get
every
dollar
possible
while
we
can
he
wo
last
always
at
this
moment
a
carriage
drove
up
and
stopped
by
the
curb
parks
turned
round
quickly
and
went
into
mason
private
office
sir
he
said
your
train
leaves
at
six
ten
and
the
carriage
is
waiting
when
randolph
mason
stepped
from
the
train
at
the
little
cliphmore
station
it
was
pitch
dark
and
the
snow
was
sweeping
past
in
great
waves
he
groped
his
way
to
the
little
and
pounded
on
the
door
there
was
no
response
as
he
turned
round
a
man
stepped
up
on
the
platform
pulled
off
his
cap
and
said
excuse
me
sir
the
carriage
is
over
here
sir
mason
followed
the
man
across
the
platform
and
up
what
seemed
to
be
a
gravel
road
for
perhaps
twenty
yards
here
they
found
a
closed
carriage
the
man
threw
open
the
door
helped
mason
in
and
closed
it
forcing
the
handle
carefully
then
he
climbed
up
in
front
struck
the
horses
and
drove
away
for
perhaps
half
an
hour
the
carriage
rattled
along
the
gravel
road
and
mason
sat
motionless
suddenly
he
leaned
over
turned
the
handle
of
the
carriage
door
and
jerked
it
sharply
the
door
did
not
open
he
tucked
the
robes
around
him
and
leaned
back
in
the
seat
like
a
man
who
had
convinced
himself
of
the
truth
of
something
that
he
suspected
presently
the
carriage
began
to
wobble
and
jolt
as
though
upon
an
unkept
country
road
the
driver
pulled
up
his
horses
and
allowed
them
to
walk
the
snow
drifted
up
around
him
and
he
seemed
to
have
great
difficulty
in
keeping
to
the
road
presently
he
stopped
climbed
down
from
the
box
and
attempted
to
open
the
door
he
apparently
had
some
difficulty
but
finally
threw
it
back
and
said
dis
is
de
place
sir
randolph
mason
got
out
and
looked
around
him
this
may
be
the
place
he
said
to
the
man
but
this
is
not
wilder
i
said
dis
here
is
de
place
answered
the
man
doggedly
beyond
a
doubt
said
mason
and
since
you
are
such
a
cunning
liar
i
will
go
in
the
driver
left
the
horses
standing
and
led
the
way
across
what
seemed
to
be
an
unkept
lawn
mason
following
a
house
loomed
up
in
the
dark
before
them
the
driver
stopped
and
rapped
on
the
door
there
was
no
light
visible
and
no
indication
of
any
inhabitant
the
driver
rapped
again
without
getting
any
response
then
he
began
to
curse
and
to
kick
the
door
violently
will
you
be
quiet
said
a
voice
from
the
inside
and
the
door
opened
the
was
dark
and
the
men
on
the
outside
could
not
see
the
speaker
here
is
de
man
sir
said
the
driver
that
is
good
replied
the
voice
come
in
the
two
men
stepped
into
the
house
the
man
who
had
bid
them
enter
closed
the
door
and
bolted
it
then
he
took
a
lantern
from
under
his
coat
and
led
them
back
through
the
hall
to
the
rear
of
the
building
the
house
was
dilapidated
and
old
and
had
the
appearance
of
having
been
deserted
for
many
years
the
man
with
the
lantern
turned
down
a
side
hall
opened
a
door
and
ushered
mason
into
a
big
room
where
there
was
a
monster
log
fire
blazing
this
room
was
dirty
and
bare
the
windows
were
carefully
covered
from
the
inside
so
as
to
prevent
the
light
from
being
seen
there
was
no
furniture
except
a
broken
table
and
a
few
old
chairs
at
the
table
sat
an
old
man
smoking
a
pipe
he
had
on
a
cap
and
overcoat
and
was
studying
a
newspaper
spread
out
before
him
he
seemed
to
be
spelling
out
the
words
with
great
difficulty
and
did
not
look
up
randolph
mason
took
off
his
threw
it
over
a
chair
and
seated
himself
before
the
fire
the
man
with
the
lantern
placed
it
on
the
took
up
a
short
pipe
and
seating
himself
on
a
box
by
the
hearth
corner
began
to
smoke
he
was
a
powerful
man
perhaps
forty
years
old
clean
and
decently
dressed
his
forehead
was
broad
his
eyes
were
unusually
big
and
blue
he
seemed
to
be
of
considerable
intelligence
and
his
expression
taken
all
in
all
was
innocent
and
kindly
for
a
time
there
was
nothing
said
the
driver
went
out
to
look
after
his
horses
the
old
man
at
the
table
labored
on
at
his
newspaper
and
randolph
mason
sat
looking
into
the
fire
suddenly
he
turned
to
the
man
at
his
left
sir
said
he
to
what
difficulty
am
i
indebted
for
this
honor
well
said
the
man
putting
his
pipe
into
his
pocket
the
combination
is
too
high
for
us
this
time
we
ca
crack
it
we
knew
about
you
and
sent
for
you
your
plan
for
getting
me
here
does
little
credit
to
your
wits
said
mason
the
trick
is
infantile
and
trite
but
it
got
you
here
anyhow
replied
the
man
yes
said
mason
when
the
dupe
is
willing
to
be
one
but
suppose
i
had
rather
concluded
to
break
with
your
driver
at
the
station
it
is
likewise
dangerous
to
drive
a
man
locked
in
a
carriage
when
he
may
easily
kill
you
through
the
window
trow
on
de
light
barker
said
the
old
man
at
the
table
what
is
de
use
of
gropin
well
said
the
younger
man
the
fact
is
simply
this
the
boss
and
leary
and
a
were
cracking
a
safe
out
in
the
states
they
were
tunnelling
up
early
in
the
morning
when
the
forced
a
jimmy
through
the
floor
the
bank
janitor
saw
it
and
they
were
all
caught
and
sent
up
for
ten
years
we
have
tried
every
way
to
get
the
boys
out
but
have
been
unable
to
do
anything
at
all
until
a
few
days
ago
we
discovered
that
one
of
the
guards
could
be
bribed
to
pass
in
a
kit
and
to
hit
the
if
there
should
be
any
shooting
if
we
could
put
up
enough
stuff
he
was
to
be
discharged
at
the
end
of
his
month
anyway
and
he
did
not
care
but
he
would
not
move
a
finger
under
four
thousand
dollars
we
have
been
two
weeks
trying
to
raise
the
money
and
have
now
only
twelve
hundred
the
guard
has
only
a
week
longer
and
another
opportunity
will
not
occur
perhaps
in
a
lifetime
we
have
tried
everything
and
can
not
raise
another
hundred
and
it
is
our
only
chance
to
save
the
boss
and
leary
dat
is
right
put
in
the
old
man
it
do
go
at
all
wid
us
we
is
gittin
trowed
on
it
and
dat
is
sure
unless
dis
gent
knows
a
good
ting
to
push
and
dat
is
what
he
is
here
fur
to
name
de
good
ting
to

dat
is
right
dat
what
we

to
have
it
now
we
do
keer
no

de
it
de

and
leary
we
wants
randolph
mason
got
up
and
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fire
the
lines
of
his
face
grew
deep
and
hard
presently
he
thrust
out
his
jaw
and
began
to
walk
backward
and
forward
across
the
room
barker
muttered
the
old
man
looking
up
for
the
first
time
de
guy
has
jimmy
iron
in
him
the
man
nodded
and
continued
to
watch
mason
curiously
suddenly
as
he
passed
the
old
man
at
the
table
mason
stopped
short
and
put
his
finger
down
on
the
newspaper
the
younger
man
leaped
up
noiselessly
and
looking
over
mason
shoulder
read
the
under
his
finger
kidnapped
it
ran
the
youngest
son
of
cornelius
rockham
stolen
from
the
millionaire
carriage
large
rewards
offered
no
clew
do

know
anything
about

said
mason
shortly
dat

replied
the
old
man

mason
straightened
up
and
swung
round
on
his
heel
sir

said

the
man
barker

replied
i

said
mason
it
is
as
plain
as
a
blue
print
come
over
here
the
two
crossed
to
the
far
corner
of
the
room
there
mason
grasped
the
man
by
the
shoulder
and
began
to
talk
to
him
rapidly
but
in
a
voice
too
low
to
be
heard
by
the
old
man
at
the
table
smoove
guy
dis
muttered
the
old
man
he
may
be
fly
in
de
nut
but
he
takes
no
chances
on
de
large
audejence
for
perhaps
twenty
minutes
randolph
mason
talked
to
the
man
at
the
wall
at
first
the
fellow
did
not
seem
to
understand
but
after
a
time
his
face
lighted
up
with
wonder
and
eagerness
and
his
assurance
seemed
to
convince
the
speaker
for
presently
they
came
back
together
to
the
fire
you
said
mason
to
the
old
man
what
is
your
name
it
cuts
no
ice
about

replied
the
old
man
pulling
at
his
pipe
fur

purposes
of
dis
seeyance

said
mason
putting
on
his
coat

the
big
man
went
out
and
presently

with

he
said

drive

the
train

you

door

remarkable
proposition
that
i
have
ever
heard
it
is
strange
replied
the
police
chief
thoughtfully
you
say
the
fellow
declared
that
he
had
a
proposition
to
make
in
regard
to
the
child
and
that
he
refused
to
make
it
save
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
yes
he
actually
said
that
he
would
not
speak
with
me
alone
or
where
he
might
be
misunderstood
but
that
he
would
come
here
at
ten
and
state
the
matter
to
me
and
such
reliable
witnesses
as
i
should
see
fit
to
have
not
less
than
three
in
number
that
a
considerable
sum
of
money
might
be
required
and
that
i
would
do
well
to
have
it
in
readiness
that
if
i
feared
robbery
or
treachery
i
should
fill
the
house
with
policemen
and
take
any
and
every
precaution
that
i
thought
necessary
in
fact
he
urged
that
i
should
have
the
most
reliable
men
possible
for
witnesses
and
as
many
as
i
desired
and
that
i
must
avail
myself
of
every
police
protection
in
order
that
i
might
feel
amply
and
thoroughly
secure
well
said
the
police
chief
if
the
fellow
is
not
straight
he
is
a
fool
no
living
crook
would
ever
make
such
a
proposition
so
i
am
convinced
replied
rockham
the
precautions
he
suggests
certainly
prove
it
he
places
himself
absolutely
in
our
hands
and
knows
that
if
any
crooked
work
should
be
attempted
we
have
everything
ready
to
thwart
it
that
there
is
nothing
that
he
could
accomplish
and
he
would
only
be
placing
himself
helplessly
in
the
grasp
of
the
police
however
we
will
not
fail
to
avail
ourselves
of
his
suggestion
you
will
see
to
it
chief
yes
said
the
officer
rising
and
putting
on
his
coat
we
will
give
him
no
possible
chance
it
is
now
five
i
will
send
the
men
in
an
hour
at
ten
that
night
the
palatial
residence
of
cornelius
rockham
was
in
a
state
of
complete
police
blockade
all
the
approaches
were
carefully
guarded
the
house
itself
from
the
basement
to
the
very
roof
literally
swarmed
with
the
trusted
spies
of
the
police
the
chief
felt
indeed
that
his
elaborate
precautions
were
in
a
vast
measure
unnecessary
he
was
not
a
quick
man
but
he
was
careful
after
a
ponderous
method
and
trusted
much
to
precautionary
safeguards
cornelius
rockham
the
chief
and
two
sergeants
in
citizen
dress
were
waiting
presently
the
bell
rang
and
a
servant
ushered
a
man
into
the
room
he
was
big
and
plainly
dressed
his
hair
was
brown
and
his
eyes
were
blue
frank
and
kindly
and
his
expression
was
pleasant
and
innocent
almost
infantile
gentlemen
he
said
i
believe
i
am
here
by
appointment
with
mr
rockham
yes
replied
cornelius
rockham
rising
pray
be
seated
sir
i
have
asked
these
gentlemen
to
be
present
as
you
suggested
your
time
is
valuable
no
doubt
said
the
man
taking
the
proffered
chair
and
i
will
consume
as
little
of
it
as
possible
my
name
is
barker
i
am
a
comparative
stranger
in
this
city
and
by
pure
accident
am
enabled
to
make
the
proposition
which
i
am
going
to
make
your
child
has
been
missing
now
for
several
days
i
believe
without
any
clew
whatever
i
do
not
know
who
kidnapped
it
nor
any
of
the
circumstances
it
is
now
ten
i
do
not
know
where
it
is
at
this
time
and
i
could
not
now
take
you
to
it
at
eleven
i
shall
know
where
it
is
and
i
shall
be
able
to
take
you
to
it
but
i
need
money
and
i
must
have
five
thousand
dollars
to
compensate
me
for
the
information
the
man
paused
for
a
moment
and
passed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
now
he
went
on
to
be
perfectly
plain
i
will
not
trust
you
and
you
of
course
will
not
trust
me
in
order
to
insure
good
faith
on
both
sides
i
must
ask
that
you
pay
me
the
money
here
in
the
presence
of
these
witnesses
then
handcuff
me
to
a
police
officer
and
i
will
take
you
to
the
child
at
eleven
you
may
surround
me
with
all
the
guards
you
think
proper
and
take
every
precaution
to
insure
your
safety
and
prevent
my
escape
you
will
pardon
my
extreme
frankness
but
business
is
business
and
we
all
know
that
matters
of
this
kind
must
be
arranged
beforehand
men
are
too
indifferent
after
they
get
what
they
want
barker
stopped
short
and
looked
up
frankly
at
the
men
around
him
cornelius
rockham
did
not
reply
but
his
white
haggard
face
lighted
up
hopefully
he
beckoned
to
the
police
chief
and
the
two
went
into
an
adjoining
room
what
do
you
think
said
rockham
turning
to
the
officer
that
man
replied
the
chief
means
what
he
says
or
else
he
is
an
insane
fool
and
he
certainly
bears
no
indication
of
the
latter
it
is
evident
that
he
will
not
open
his
mouth
until
he
gets
the
money
for
the
reason
that
he
is
afraid
that
he
will
be
ignored
after
the
child
is
recovered
i
do
not
believe
there
is
any
risk
in
paying
him
now
and
doing
as
he
says
because
he
can
not
possibly
escape
when
fastened
to
a
sergeant
and
if
he
proves
to
be
a
fake
or
tries
any
crooked
work
we
will
return
the
money
to
you
and
lock
him
up
i
am
inclined
to
agree
with
you
replied
rockham
the
man
is
eccentric
and
suspicious
but
he
certainly
will
not
move
until
paid
and
we
have
no
charge
as
yet
upon
which
to
arrest
him
nor
would
it
avail
us
anything
if
we
did
there
is
little
if
any
risk
and
much
probability
of
learning
something
of
the
boy
i
will
do
it
he
went
down
to
the
far
end
of
the
hall
and
took
a
package
of
bills
from
a
desk
then
the
two
men
returned
to
the
sir
said
rockham
to
barker
i
accept
your
proposition
here
is
the
money
but
you
must
consider
yourself
utterly
in
our
hands
i
am
willing
to
trust
you
but
i
am
going
to
follow
your
suggestion
a
contract
is
a
contract
replied
barker
taking
the
money
and
counting
it
carefully
when
he
had
satisfied
himself
that
the
amount
was
correct
he
thrust
the
roll
of
bills
into
his
outside
it
is
now
fifteen
minutes
until
eleven
said
the
police
chief
stepping
up
to
barker
chair
and
if
you
are
ready
we
will
go
i
am
ready
said
the
man
getting
up
the
police
chief
took
a
pair
of
steel
handcuffs
from
his
pocket
locked
one
part
of
them
carefully
on
barker
left
wrist
and
fastened
the
other
to
the
right
wrist
of
the
sergeant
then
they
went
out
of
the
house
and
down
the
steps
to
the
carriages
the
police
chief
barker
and
the
sergeant
climbed
into
the
first
carriage
and
rockham
and
the
other
officer
into
the
second
have
your
man
drive
to
the
central
park
entrance
said
barker
to
the
chief
the
officer
called
to
the
driver
and
the
carriages
rolled
away
at
the
west
entrance
to
central
park
the
men
alighted
now
gentlemen
said
barker
we
must
walk
west
to
the
second
corner
and
wait
there
until
a
cab
passes
from
the
east
the
cab
will
be
close
curtained
and
will
be
drawn
by
a
sorrel
cob
as
it
passes
you
will
dart
out
seize
the
horse
and
take
possession
of
the
cab
you
will
find
the
child
in
the
cab
but
i
must
insist
for
my
own
welfare
that
you
make
every
appearance
of
having
me
under
arrest
and
in
close
custody
the
five
men
turned
down
the
street
in
the
direction
indicated
rockham
and
one
of
the
officers
in
the
front
and
the
other
two
following
with
barker
between
them
for
a
time
they
walked
along
in
silence
then
the
police
chief
took
some
cigars
from
his
pocket
gave
one
to
the
sergeant
and
offering
them
to
barker
said
will
you
smoke
sir
not
a
cigar
i
thank
you
replied
the
man
but
if
you
will
permit
me
i
will
light
my
pipe
the
two
men
stopped
barker
took
a
short
pipe
and
a
pouch
of
tobacco
from
his
pocket
filled
the
pipe
and
lighted
it
as
he
was
about
to
return
the
pouch
to
his
coat
pocket
an
old
hobbling
past
caught
the
odor
and
stopped

uv
yer
terbaccy
barker
laughed
tossed
her
the
pouch
and
the
three
hurried
on
at
the
corner
indicated
the
men
stopped
the
police
chief
examined
the
handcuffs
carefully
to
see
that
they
were
all
right
then
they
drew
back
in
the
shadow
and
waited
for
the
cab
eleven
came
and
passed
and
the
cab
did
not
appear
rockham
paced
the
sidewalk
nervously
and
the
policemen
gathered
close
around
barker
at
eleven
barker
straightened
up
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
turned
to
the
police
chief
it
is
no
use
he
said
they
are
not
here
and
they
never
will
come
now
what
cried
the
police
chief
savagely
do
you
mean
that
we
are
fooled
yes
said
barker
all
of
us
it
is
no
use
i
tell
you
the
thing
is
over
it
is
not
over
with
you
my
man
growled
the
chief
here
sergeant
get
rockham
his
money
and
let
us
lock
this
fellow
up
the
sergeant
turned
and
thrust
his
hand
into
barker
outside
then
his
chin
dropped
and
he
turned
white
it
is
gone
he
muttered
gone
shouted
rockham
search
the
rascal
the
sergeant
began
to
go
carefully
over
the
man
suddenly
he
stopped
chief
he
muttered
it
was
in
that
tobacco
pouch
the
police
chief
staggered
back
and
spun
round
on
his
heel
angels
of
hell
he
gasped
it
was
a
cute
trick
and
it
threw
us
all
every
one
of
us
rockham
bounded
forward
and
brought
his
hand
down
heavily
on
shoulder
as
for
you
my
fine
fellow
he
said
bitterly
we
have
you
all
right
and
we
will
land
you
in

barker
was
silent
in
the
dark
the
men
could
not
see
that
he
was
smiling
iii
the
of
judge
walter
wright
was
filled
with
an
interested
audience
of
the
greater
and
unpunished
criminals
of
new
york
the
application
of
barker
for
a
on
the
ground
that
he
had
committed
no
crime
had
attracted
wide
attention
it
was
known
that
the
facts
were
not
disputed
and
the
proceeding
was
a
matter
of
wonder
some
days
before
the
case
had
been
submitted
to
the
learned
judge
the
attorneys
for
the
people
had
not
been
anxious
enough
to
be
interested
and
looked
upon
the
application
as
a
farce
the
young
man
who
appeared
for
barker
announced
that
he
represented
one
randolph
mason
a
counsellor
and
was
present
only
for
the
purpose
of
asking
that
barker
be
discharged
and
for
the
further
purpose
of
filing
the
brief
of
mason
in
support
of
the
application
he
made
no
argument
whatever
and
had
simply
handed
up
the
brief
which
the
attorneys
for
the
people
had
not
thought
it
worth
their
while
to
examine
barker
sat
in
the
dock
grim
and
confident
the
attorneys
for
the
commonwealth
were
listless
the
audience
was
silent
and
attentive
it
was
a
vital
matter
to
them
if
barker
had
committed
no
crime
what
a
rich
untramped
field
was
open
the
judge
laid
his
hand
upon
the
books
piled
up
beside
him
and
looked
down
at
the
bar
this
proceeding
he
began
is
upon
the
application
of
one
lemuel
barker
for
a
writ
of
asking
that
he
be
discharged
from
custody
upon
the
ground
that
he
has
committed
no
crime
punishable
at
common
law
or
under
the
statutes
of
new
york
an
agreed
state
of
facts
has
been
submitted
upon
which
he
stands
charged
by
the
commonwealth
with
having
obtained
five
thousand
dollars
from
one
cornelius
rockham
by
false
pretences
the
facts
are
briefly
that
on
the
day
of
december
barker
called
at
the
residence
of
rockham
and
said
that
he
desired
to
make
a
proposition
looking
to
the
recovery
of
the
lost
child
of
said
rockham
but
he
desired
to
make
it
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
and
would
return
at
ten
that
night
pursuant
to
his
appointment
barker
again
presented
himself
at
the
residence
of
said
rockham
and
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
declared
in
substance
that
at
that
time
then
ten
he
knew
nothing
of
the
said
child
could
not
produce
it
and
could
give
no
information
in
regard
to
it
but
that
at
eleven
he
would
know
where
the
child
was
and
would
produce
it
and
that
if
the
said
rockham
would
then
and
there
pay
him
five
thousand
dollars
he
would
at
eleven
take
them
to
the
lost
child
the
money
was
paid
and
the
transaction
completed
at
eleven
barker
took
the
men
to
a
certain
corner
in
the
upper
part
of
this
city
and
it
there
developed
that
the
entire
matter
was
a
scheme
on
his
part
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
the
said
sum
of
money
which
he
had
in
some
manner
disposed
of
and
that
he
in
fact
knew
nothing
of
the
child
and
never
intended
to
produce
it
the
attorneys
for
the
people
considered
it
idle
to
discuss
what
they
believed
to
be
such
a
plain
case
of
obtaining
money
under
false
pretences
and
i
confess
that
upon
first
hearing
i
was
inclined
to
believe
the
proceeding
a
useless
imposition
upon
the
judiciary
i
have
had
occasion
to
change
my
opinion
the
attorneys
present
looked
at
each
other
with
wonder
and
drew
their
chairs
closer
to
the
table
the
audience
moved
anxiously
the
prisoner
continued
the
judge
has
filed
in
his
behalf
the
remarkable
brief
of
one
randolph
mason
a
counsellor
this
i
have
read
first
with
curiosity
then
interest
then
wonder
and
finally
conviction
in
it
the
crime
sought
to
be
charged
is
traced
from
the
days
of
the
west
saxon
wights
up
to
the
present
beginning
with
the
most
ancient
cases
and
ending
with
the
later
decisions
of
our
own
court
of
appeals
i
have
gone
over
these
cases
with
great
care
and
find
that
the
vital
element
of
this
crime
is
and
has
ever
been
the
false
and
fraudulent
representation
or
statement
as
to
an
or
hence
no
representation
however
false
in
regard
to
a
transaction
can
be
a
crime
nor
can
a
false
statement
in
its
nature
be
the
subject
of
a
criminal
charge
to
constitute
this
crime
there
must
always
be
a
false
representation
or
statement
as
to
a
and
that
must
be
a
or
an
these
are
plain
statements
of
ancient
and
well
settled
law
and
laid
here
in
this
brief
almost
in
the
exact
language
of
our
courts
in
this
case
the
vital
element
of
crime
is
wanting
the
evidence
fails
utterly
to
show
false
representation
as
to
any
the
prisoner
barker
at
the
time
of
the
transaction
positively
disclaimed
any
knowledge
of
the
child
or
any
ability
to
produce
it
what
he
did
represent
was
that
he
would
know
and
that
he
would
perform
certain
things
in
the
future
the
question
of
remoteness
is
irrelevant
it
is
immaterial
whether
the
future
time
be
removed
minutes
or
years
the
false
representation
complained
of
was
wholly
in
regard
to
a
future
transaction
and
essentially
promissory
in
its
nature
and
such
a
wrong
is
not
and
never
has
been
held
to
be
the
foundation
of
a
criminal
charge
but
if
your
honor
please
said
the
senior
counsel
for
the
people
rising
is
it
not
clearly
evident
that
the
prisoner
barker
began
with
a
design
to
defraud
that
that
design
was
present
and
obtained
at
the
time
of
this
transaction
that
a
representation
was
made
to
rockham
for
the
purpose
of
convincing
him
that
there
then
existed
a
intention
to
produce
his
child
that
money
was
obtained
by
false
statements
in
regard
to
this
intention
then
existing
when
in
fact
such
intention
did
not
exist
and
never
existed
and
statements
made
to
induce
rockham
to
believe
that
it
did
exist
were
all
utterly
false
fraudulent
and
delusive
surely
this
is
a
crime
the
attorney
sat
down
with
the
air
of
one
who
had
propounded
an
unanswerable
proposition
the
judge
adjusted
his
eyeglasses
and
began
to
turn
the
pages
of
a
report
i
read
he
said
from
the
syllabus
of
the
case
of
the
people
of
new
york
john
blanchard
indictment
for
false
pretences
may
not
be
founded
upon
an
assertion
of
an
existing
intention
although
it
did
not
in
fact
exist
there
must
be
a
false
representation
as
to
an
existing
fact
your
statement
sir
in
regard
to
intention
in
this
case
is
true
but
it
is
no
element
of
crime
but
sir
interposed
the
counsel
for
the
people
now
fully
awake
to
the
fact
that
barker
was
slipping
from
his
grasp
i
ask
to
hold
this
man
for
conspiracy
and
as
a
violator
of
the
statute
of
cheats
sir
said
the
judge
with
some
show
of
impatience
i
call
your
attention
to
scott
case
and
the
leading
case
of
ranney
in
the
former
the
learned
court
announces
that
if
the
false
and
fraudulent
representations
are
not
criminal
there
can
be
no
conspiracy
and
in
the
latter
the
court
says
plainly
that
false
pretences
in
former
statutes
and
gross
fraud
or
cheat
in
the
more
recent
acts
mean
essentially
the
same
thing
you
must
further
well
know
that
this
man
could
not
be
indicted
at
common
law
for
cheat
because
no
false
token
was
used
and
because
in
respect
to
the
instrumentality
by
which
it
was
accomplished
it
had
no
special
reference
to
the
public
interest
this
case
is
most
remarkable
in
that
it
bears
all
the
marks
of
a
gross
and
detestable
fraud
and
in
morals
is
a
vicious
and
grievous
wrong
but
under
our
law
it
is
no
crime
and
the
offender
can
not
be
punished
i
understand
your
honor
to
hold
said
the
baffled
attorney
jumping
to
his
feet
that
this
man
is
guilty
of
no
crime
that
the
dastardly
act
which
he
confesses
to
have
done
constitutes
no
crime
and
that
he
is
to
go
out
of
this
freed
from
every
description
of
liability
or
responsibility
to
any
criminal
tribunal
that
the
law
is
so
defective
and
its
arm
so
short
that
it
can
not
pluck
forth
the
offender
and
punish
him
when
by
every
instinct
of
morality
he
is
a
criminal
if
this
be
true
what
a
limitless
field
is
open
to
the
knave
and
what
a
snug
harbor
for
him
is
the
great
commonwealth
of
new
york
i
can
pardon
your
abruptness
said
the
judge
looking
down
upon
the
angry
and
excited
counsellor
for
the
reason
that
your
words
are
almost
exactly
the
lament
of
presiding
justice
mullin
in
the
case
of
scott
but
sir
this
is
not
a
matter
of
sentiment
it
is
not
a
matter
of
morality
it
is
not
even
a
matter
of
right
it
is
purely
and
simply
a
matter
of
law
and
there
is
no
law
the
judge
unconsciously
arose
and
stood
upright
beside
the
bench
the
audience
of
criminals
bent
forward
in
their
seats
i
feel
he
continued
for
the
first
time
the
utter
inability
of
the
law
to
cope
with
the
gigantic
cunning
of
evil
i
appreciate
the
utter
villainy
that
pervaded
this
entire
transaction
i
am
convinced
that
it
was
planned
with
painstaking
care
by
some
master
mind
moved
by
satanic
impulse
i
now
know
that
there
is
abroad
in
this
city
a
malicious
intelligence
of
almost
infinite
genius
against
which
the
machinery
of
the
law
is
inoperative
against
every
sentiment
of
common
right
of
common
justice
i
am
compelled
to
decide
that
lemuel
barker
is
guilty
of
no
crime
and
stands
acquit
it
was
high
noon
the
audience
of
criminals
passed
out
from
the
temple
of
justice
and
with
them
went
lemuel
barker
unwhipped
and
brazen
now
with
ample
means
by
which
to
wrest
his
fellows
in
villainy
from
the
righteous
wrath
of
the
commonwealth
they
were
all
enemies
of
this
same
commonwealth
bitter
never
wearying
enemies
and
they
had
learned
much
how
the
law
was
wondrous
marvel
that
they
had
not
known
it
sooner
to
be
sure
they
must
plan
so
cunningly
that
only
the
judge
should
pass
upon
them
he
was
a
mere
legal
machine
he
was
only
the
hand
applying
the
rigid
rule
of
the
law
the
danger
was
with
the
jury
there
lay
the
peril
to
be
avoided
the
jury
how
they
hated
it
and
feared
it
and
of
right
for
none
knew
better
than
they
that
whenever
and
and
however
men
stop
to
probe
for
it
they
always
find
far
down
in
the
human
heart
a
great
love
of
common
right
and
fair
dealing
that
is
as
and
abiding
as
the
very
springs
of
life
vi
the
sheriff
of
gullmore
the
crime
of
embezzlement
here
dealt
with
is
statutory
the
venue
of
this
story
could
have
been
laid
in
many
other
states
the
statutes
are
similar
to
a
degree
see
the
code
of
west
virginia
also
the
late
case
of
the
state
bolin
southwestern
reporter
also
the
long
list
of
ancient
cases
in
russell
on
crimes
volume
i
it
is
hard
luck
colonel
said
the
broker
but
you
are
are
not
the
only
one
skinned
in
the
deal
the
best
of
them
caught
it
by
jupiter
the
pit
was
like
dante
inferno
yes
it
gone
i
reckon
muttered
the
colonel
shutting
his
teeth
down
tight
on
his
cigar
i
guess
the
devil
wins
every
two
out
of
three
well
said
the
broker
turning
to
his
desk
it
is
the
fortune
of
war
no
young
man
growled
the
colonel
it
is
the
blasted
misfortune
of
peace
i
have
never
had
any
trouble
with
the
fortune
of
war
i
could
stand
on
an
ace
high
and
win
with
war
it
is
peace
that
queers
me
here
in
the
of
the
nineteenth
century
i
colonel
moseby
allen
sheriff
of
county
west
virginia
go
up
against
another
game
yes
and
go
up
in
the
daytime
say
young
man
it
feels
queer
at
the
mellow
age
of
after
you
have
been
in
the
legislature
of
a
great
commonwealth
and
at
the
very
expiration
of
your
term
as
sheriff
of
the
whitest
and
the
freest
county
in
west
virginia
i
say
it
feels
queer
after
all
those
high
honors
to
be
suddenly
reminded
that
you
need
to
be
accompanied
by
a
business
chaperon
the
colonel
stood
perfectly
erect
and
delivered
his
oration
with
the
fluency
and
the
abandon
of
a
southern
orator
when
he
had
finished
he
bowed
low
to
the
broker
pulled
his
big
slouch
hat
down
on
his
forehead
and
stalked
out
of
the
office
and
down
the
steps
to
the
street
colonel
moseby
allen
was
built
on
the
decided
lines
of
a
southern
mountaineer
he
was
big
and
but
he
was
not
well
proportioned
his
body
was
short
and
heavy
while
his
legs
were
long
his
eyes
were
and
shone
like
little
brown
beads
on
the
whole
his
face
indicated
cunning
bluster
and
rashness
the
ward
politician
would
have
recognized
him
among
a
thousand
as
a
kindred
spirit
and
the
professional
gambler
would
not
have
felt
so
sure
of
himself
with
such
a
face
across
the
table
from
him
when
the
colonel
stepped
out
on
the
pavement
he
stopped
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
looked
up
and
down
wall
street
then
he
jerked
the
cigar
out
of
his
mouth
threw
it
into
the
gutter
and
began
to
deliver
himself
of
a
philippic
upon
the
negative
merits
of
brokers
in
general
and
his
broker
in
particular
the
virginian
possessed
a
vocabulary
of
smooth
billingsgate
that
in
vividness
and
diversity
approached
the
sublime
when
he
had
consigned
some
seven
generations
of
his
broker
ancestry
to
divers
minutely
described
localities
in
perdition
he
began
to
warm
to
his
work
and
his
artistic
profanity
rolled
forth
in
startling
periods
the
stopped
and
looked
on
in
surprise
and
wonder
for
a
moment
they
were
half
convinced
that
the
man
was
a
religious
fanatic
his
eloquent
almost
poetic
tirade
was
so
thoroughly
filled
with
holy
names
the
effect
of
the
growing
audience
inspired
the
speaker
he
raised
his
voice
and
began
to
emphasize
with
sweeping
gestures
he
had
now
finished
with
the
broker
ancestry
and
was
plunging
with
a
rush
of
gorgeous
pyrotechnics
into
the
certain
future
of
the
broker
himself
when
a
police
officer
pushed
through
the
crowd
and
caught
the
irate
virginian
by
the
shoulder
colonel
allen
paused
and
looked
down
at
the
officer
you
he
said
calmly
i
opine
are
a
minion
of
the
law
a
hireling
of
the
municipal
authorities
see
here
said
the
officer
you
are
not
allowed
to
preach
on
the
street
you
will
have
to
come
with
me
to
the
the
colonel
bowed
suavely
sir
he
said
i
colonel
moseby
allen
sheriff
of
gullmore
county
in
the
mountain
state
of
west
virginia
am
a
respecter
of
the
law
even
in
the
body
of
its
petty
henchmen
and
if
the
ordinances
of
this
godforsaken
gomorrah
are
such
that
a
american
citizen
years
old
and
white
is
not
permitted
the
inalienable
privilege
of
expressing
his
opinion
without
let
or
hindrance
then
i
am
quite
content
to
accompany
you
to
the
confines
of
your
accursed
allen
turned
round
and
started
down
the
street
with
the
officer
he
walked
a
little
in
advance
and
continued
to
curse
glibly
in
a
low
monotone
when
they
were
half
way
to
the
corner
below
a
little
man
slipped
out
of
the
crowd
and
hurried
up
to
the
policeman
mike
he
whispered
putting
his
hand
under
the
officer
here
is
five
for
you
turn
him
over
to
me
the
officer
closed
his
hand
like
a
trap
stepped
quickly
forward
and
touched
his
prisoner
on
the
shoulder
as
the
virginian
turned
the
officer
said
in
a
loud
voice
mr
parks
here
says
that
he
knows
you
and
that
you
are
all
right
so
i
let
you
go
this
time
then
before
any
reply
could
be
made
he
vanished
around
the
corner
colonel
allen
regarded
his
deliverer
with
the
air
of
a
cynic
well
he
said
one
is
rarely
delivered
from
the
spoiler
by
the
hand
of
his
friend
and
i
can
not
now
recall
ever
having
had
you
for
an
enemy
may
i
inquire
what
motive
prompts
this
gracious
courtesy
do
speak
so
loud
said
parks
stepping
up
close
to
the
man
i
happen
to
know
something
about
your
loss
colonel
allen
and
perhaps
also
a
way
to
regain
it
will
you
come
with
me
the
virginian
whistled
softly
yes
he
said
ii
this
is
a
fine
hotel
observed
colonel
allen
beginning
to
mellow
under
the
mystic
spell
of
a
dinner
and
a
quart
of
cliquot
devilish
fine
hotel
mr
parks
all
the
divers
moneys
which
i
in
my
official
capacity
have
collected
in
taxes
from
the
fertile
county
of
gullmore
would
scarcely
pay
for
the
rich
embellishment
of
the
barber
shop
of
this
magnificent
edifice
well
colonel
said
the
bald
parks
with
a
sad
smile
that
would
depend
upon
the
amount
of
the
revenues
of
your
county
i
presume
that
they
are
large
and
consequently
the
office
of
sheriff
a
good
one
yes
sir
answered
the
virginian
it
is
generally
considered
desirable
from
the
standpoint
of
prominence
the
climate
of
gullmore
is
salubrious
its
pasture
lands
are
fertile
and
its
citizens
cultured
and
refined
to
a
degree
unusual
even
in
the
ancient
and
aristocratic
counties
of
the
old
dominion
and
sir
here
the
colonel
drew
himself
up
proudly
and
thrust
his
hand
into
the
breast
of
his
coat
i
am
proud
sir
proud
to
declare
that
from
time
to
time
the
good
citizens
of
gullmore
by
means
of
their
suffrage
and
with
large
and
comfortable
majorities
have
proclaimed
me
their
favorite
son
and
competent
official
six
years
ago
i
was
in
the
legislature
at
charleston
as
the
trusted
representative
of
this
grand
old
county
of
gullmore
and
four
years
ago
after
the
fiercest
and
most
bitterly
contested
political
conflict
of
all
the
history
of
the
south
i
was
elected
to
that
most
important
and
honorable
office
of
sheriff
to
the
lasting
glory
of
my
public
fame
and
the
great
gratification
of
the
commonwealth
that
gratification
is
now
four
years
old
mused
parks
colonel
moseby
allen
darted
a
swift
suspicious
glance
at
his
companion
but
in
a
moment
it
was
gone
and
he
had
dropped
back
into
his
grandiloquent
discourse
yes
sir
the
banner
county
of
west
virginia
deserting
her
ancient
and
sacred
traditions
and
forgetting
for
the
time
the
imperishable
precepts
of
her
patriotic
fathers
has
gone
over
to
affiliate
with
the
ungodly
we
were
beaten
sir
beaten
in
this
last
engagement
horse
foot
and
dragoons
beaten
by
a
set
of
a
set
of
unregenerate
political
tricksters
of
such
diabolical
cunning
that
nothing
but
the
gates
of
hell
could
have
prevailed
against
them
now
sir
now
and
i
say
it
mournfully
there
is
nothing
left
to
us
in
the
county
of
gullmore
save
only
honor
honor
sneered
parks
an
imaginary
rope
to
hold
fools
with
it
wont
fill
a
hungry
stomach
or
satisfy
a
delinquent
account
the
little
clerk
spoke
the
latter
part
of
his
sentence
slowly
and
deliberately
again
the
suspicious
expression
passed
over
the
face
of
colonel
allen
leaving
traces
of
fear
and
anxiety
in
its
wake
his
eyes
naturally
a
little
crossed
drew
in
toward
his
nose
and
the
muscles
around
his
mouth
grew
hard
for
a
moment
he
was
silent
looking
down
into
his
glass
then
with
an
effort
he
went
on
yes
the
whole
is
in
the
hands
of
the
philistines
from
the
members
of
the
county
court
up
to
the
important
and
responsible
position
which
i
have
filled
for
the
last
four
years
and
when
my
accounts
are
finally
wound
up
i
your
accounts
murmured
parks
when
they
are
finally
wound
up
what
then
every
trace
of
color
vanished
from
the
virginian
face
his
heavy
jaws
trembled
and
he
caught
hold
of
the
arms
of
the
chair
to
steady
himself
parks
did
not
look
up
he
seemed
deeply
absorbed
in
studying
the
bottom
of
his
glass
for
a
moment
colonel
moseby
allen
had
been
caught
off
his
guard
but
it
was
only
for
a
moment
he
straightened
up
and
underwent
a
complete
transformation
then
bending
forward
he
said
speaking
low
and
distinctly
look
here
my
friend
you
are
the
best
guesser
this
side
of
hell
now
if
you
can
pick
a
winning
horse
we
will
divide
the
pool
the
two
men
were
at
a
table
in
a
corner
of
the
hoffman
café
and
as
it
chanced
alone
in
the
room
parks
glanced
around
quickly
then
he
leaned
over
and
said
that
depends
on
just
one
thing
colonel
turn
up
the
cards
growled
the
virginian
shutting
his
teeth
down
tight
on
his
lip
well
said
parks
you
must
promise
to
stick
to
your
rôle
to
the
end
if
you
commence
with
the
play
the
southerner
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
stroked
his
chin
thoughtfully
finally
he
dropped
his
hand
and
looked
up
all
right
he
muttered
i
stand
by
the
deal
throw
out
the
cards
parks
moved
his
chair
nearer
to
the
table
and
leaned
over
on
his
elbow
colonel
he
said
there
is
only
one
living
man
who
can
set
up
a
successful
against
fate
that
is
dead
certain
to
win
and
that
man
is
here
in
new
york
he
is
a
great
lawyer
and
besides
being
that
he
is
the
greatest
plotter
since
the
days
of
napoleon
not
one
of
his
clients
ever
saw
the
inside
of
a
prison
he
can
show
men
how
to
commit
crimes
in
such
a
way
that
the
law
can
not
touch
them
no
matter
how
desperate
the
position
may
be
he
can
always
show
the
man
who
is
in
it
a
way
by
which
he
can
get
out
there
is
no
case
so
hopeless
that
he
can
not
manage
it
if
money
is
needed
he
can
show
you
how
to
get
it
a
plain
practical
way
by
which
you
can
get
what
you
need
and
as
much
as
you
need
he
has
a
great
mind
but
he
is
strangely
queer
and
erratic
and
must
be
approached
with
extreme
care
and
only
in
a
certain
way
this
man
continued
the
little
clerk
lowering
his
voice
is
named
randolph
mason
you
must
go
to
him
and
explain
the
whole
matter
and
you
must
do
it
just
in
the
way
i
tell
you
again
the
virginian
whistled
softly
my
friend
he
said
there
is
a
little
too
much
mystery
about
this
matter
i
am
not
afraid
of
you
because
you
are
a
rascal
no
one
ever
had
a
face
like
you
that
was
not
a
rascal
you
will
stick
to
me
because
you
are
out
for
the
stuff
and
there
is
no
possible
way
to
make
a
dollar
by
throwing
the
game
i
am
not
afraid
of
any
living
man
if
i
have
an
opportunity
to
see
his
face
before
the
bluff
is
made
you
are
all
right
your
game
is
to
use
me
in
making
some
haul
that
is
a
little
too
high
for
yourself
that
is
what
you
have
been
working
up
to
and
you
are
a
smooth
operator
my
friend
a
greenhorn
would
have
concluded
long
ago
that
you
were
a
detective
but
i
knew
a
blamed
sight
better
than
that
the
moment
you
made
your
first
lead
in
the
first
place
you
are
too
sharp
to
waste
your
time
with
any
such
bosh
and
in
the
second
place
it
takes
cash
to
buy
detectives
and
there
is
nobody
following
me
with
cash
gullmore
county
has
no
kick
coming
to
it
until
my
final
settlements
are
made
and
there
is
no
man
treading
shoe
leather
that
knows
anything
about
the
condition
of
my
official
business
except
myself
and
perhaps
also
that
shrewd
and
mysterious
guesser
yourself
so
you
see
i
am
not
standing
on
ceremonies
with
you
but
here
young
man
comes
in
a
dark
horse
and
you
want
me
to
bet
on
him
blindfolded
those
are
not
the
methods
of
moseby
allen
i
must
be
let
in
a
little
deeper
on
this
thing
all
i
want
you
to
do
said
parks
putting
his
hand
confidentially
on
the
virginian
arm
is
simply
to
go
and
see
randolph
mason
and
him
in
the
way
i
tell
you
and
when
you
have
done
that
i
will
wager
that
you
stay
and
explain
everything
to
him
colonel
allen
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
why
should
i
do
that
he
said
curtly
well
murmured
the
little
man
mournfully
one
bondsmen
are
entitled
to
some
consideration
and
then
there
is
the
penitentiary
courts
have
a
way
of
sending
men
there
for
embezzlement
you
are
correct
said
allen
quietly
and
i
have
not
time
to
go
at
any
rate
continued
parks
there
can
be
no
possible
danger
to
you
you
are
taking
no
chances
mason
is
a
member
of
the
new
york
bar
and
anything
you
may
tell
him
he
dare
not
reveal
the
law
would
not
permit
him
to
do
so
if
he
desired
the
whole
matter
would
be
kept
as
thoroughly
inviolate
as
though
it
were
made
in
the
confessional
your
objections
are
all
idle
you
are
a
man
in
a
desperate
position
you
are
up
to
your
waist
in
the
quicksand
now
and
at
the
end
of
the
year
it
is
bound
to
close
over
your
head
it
is
folly
to
look
up
at
the
sky
and
attempt
to
ignore
this
fact
i
offer
to
help
you
not
from
any
goodness
of
heart
understand
but
because
we
can
both
make
a
stake
in
this
thing
i
need
money
and
you
must
have
money
that
is
the
whole
thing
in
a
nutshell
now
said
parks
rising
from
his
chair
what
are
you
going
to
do
well
said
the
virginian
drawing
up
his
long
legs
and
spreading
out
his
fat
hands
on
the
table
moseby
allen
of
the
county
of
gullmore
will
take
five
cards
if
you
iii
this
must
be
the
place
muttered
the
virginian
stopping
under
the
electric
light
and
looking
up
at
the
big
house
on
the
avenue
that
fellow
said
i
would
know
the
place
by
the
door
and
there
it
is
as
certain
as
there
are
back
taxes
in
gullmore
with
that
colonel
moseby
allen
walked
up
the
granite
steps
and
began
to
grope
about
in
the
dark
for
the
electric
bell
he
could
find
no
trace
of
this
indispensable
convenience
and
was
beginning
to
lapse
into
a
flow
of
curses
when
he
noticed
for
the
first
time
an
ancient
silver
knocker
fastened
to
the
middle
of
the
door
he
seized
it
and
banged
it
vigorously
the
virginian
stood
in
the
dark
and
waited
finally
he
concluded
that
the
noise
had
not
been
heard
and
was
about
to
repeat
the
signal
when
the
door
was
flung
suddenly
open
and
a
tall
man
holding
a
candle
in
his
hand
loomed
up
in
the
i
am
looking
stammered
the
southerner
for
one
randolph
mason
an
i
am
randolph
mason
said
the
man
thrusting
the
silver
candlestick
out
before
him
who
are
you
sir
my
name
is
allen
answered
the
southerner
moseby
allen
of
gullmore
county
west
virginia
a
virginian
said
mason
what
evil
circumstance
brings
you
here
then
allen
remembered
the
instructions
which
parks
had
given
him
so
minutely
he
took
off
his
hat
and
passed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
well
he
said
i
suppose
the
same
thing
that
brings
the
others
we
get
in
and
plunge
along
just
as
far
as
we
can
then
fate
shuts
down
the
lid
of
her
trap
and
we
have
either
to
drop
off
the
bridge
or
come
here
come
in
said
mason
then
he
turned
abruptly
and
walked
down
the
the
southerner
followed
impressed
by
this
individuality
allen
had
pushed
his
way
through
life
with
bluff
and
bluster
and
like
that
one
in
the
scriptural
writings
neither
feared
god
nor
regarded
man
his
unlimited
assurance
had
never
failed
him
before
any
of
high
or
low
degree
and
to
be
impressed
with
the
power
of
any
man
was
to
him
strange
and
uncomfortable
mason
turned
into
his
library
and
placed
the
candlestick
on
a
table
in
the
centre
of
the
floor
then
he
drew
up
two
chairs
and
sat
down
in
one
of
them
motioning
allen
to
the
other
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
the
room
was
long
and
empty
except
for
the
rows
of
heavy
standing
back
in
the
darkness
the
floor
was
bare
and
there
was
no
furniture
of
any
kind
whatever
except
the
great
table
and
the
ancient
chairs
there
was
no
light
but
the
candle
standing
high
in
its
silver
candlestick
sir
said
mason
when
the
virginian
had
seated
himself
which
do
you
seek
to
evade
punishment
or
dishonor
the
virginian
turned
round
put
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
looked
squarely
across
at
his
questioner
i
am
not
fool
enough
to
care
for
the
bark
he
answered
provided
the
dog
teeth
are
muzzled
it
is
well
said
mason
slowly
there
is
often
difficulty
in
dealing
with
double
problems
where
both
disgrace
and
punishment
are
sought
to
be
evaded
where
there
is
but
one
difficulty
to
face
it
can
usually
be
handled
with
ease
what
others
are
involved
in
your
matter
no
others
answered
the
virginian
i
am
seeking
only
to
save
myself
from
the
law
only
continued
mason
or
does
private
vengeance
join
with
it
from
the
law
only
answered
allen
let
me
hear
it
all
said
mason
well
said
the
virginian
shifting
uneasily
in
his
chair
my
affairs
are
in
a
very
bad
way
and
every
attempt
that
i
have
made
to
remedy
them
has
resulted
only
in
disaster
i
am
walking
with
my
hands
tied
straight
into
the
penitentiary
unless
some
miracle
can
be
performed
in
my
favor
everything
has
gone
dead
against
me
from
my
first
fool
move
four
years
ago
i
was
elected
sheriff
of
gullmore
county
in
the
state
of
west
virginia
i
was
of
course
required
by
law
to
give
a
large
bond
this
i
had
much
difficulty
in
doing
for
the
reason
that
i
have
no
estate
whatever
finally
i
induced
my
brother
and
my
father
who
is
a
very
old
man
to
mortgage
their
property
and
thereby
secured
the
requisite
bond
i
entered
upon
the
duties
of
my
office
and
assumed
entire
control
of
the
revenues
of
the
county
for
a
time
i
managed
them
carefully
and
kept
my
private
business
apart
from
that
of
the
county
but
i
had
never
been
accustomed
to
strict
business
methods
and
i
soon
found
it
most
difficult
to
confine
myself
to
them
little
by
little
i
began
to
lapse
into
my
old
habit
of
carelessness
i
neglected
to
keep
up
the
settlements
and
permitted
the
official
business
to
become
intermixed
with
my
private
accounts
the
result
was
that
i
awoke
one
morning
to
find
that
i
owed
the
county
of
gullmore
ten
thousand
dollars
i
began
at
once
to
calculate
the
possibility
of
my
being
able
to
meet
this
deficit
before
the
expiration
of
my
term
of
office
and
soon
found
that
by
no
possible
means
would
i
be
able
to
raise
this
amount
out
of
the
remaining
fees
my
gambling
instincts
at
once
asserted
themselves
i
took
five
thousand
dollars
went
to
lexington
and
began
to
play
the
races
in
a
vain
reckless
hope
that
i
might
win
enough
to
square
my
accounts
i
lost
from
the
very
start
i
came
back
to
my
county
and
went
on
as
before
hoping
against
hope
that
something
would
turn
up
and
let
me
out
of
course
this
was
the
dream
of
an
idiot
and
when
the
opposition
won
at
the
last
election
and
a
new
sheriff
was
installed
and
i
was
left
but
a
few
months
within
which
to
close
up
my
accounts
the
end
which
i
had
refused
to
think
of
arose
and
stared
me
in
the
face
i
was
now
at
the
end
of
my
tether
and
there
was
nothing
there
but
a
tomb
and
even
that
way
was
not
open
if
i
should
escape
the
penitentiary
by
flight
or
by
suicide
i
would
still
leave
my
brother
and
my
aged
father
to
bear
the
entire
burden
of
my
defalcations
and
when
they
as
my
bondsmen
had
paid
the
sum
to
the
county
they
would
all
be
paupers
the
man
paused
and
mopped
the
perspiration
from
his
face
he
was
now
terribly
in
earnest
and
seemed
to
be
realizing
the
gravity
and
the
hopelessness
of
his
crime
all
his
bluster
and
grandiloquent
airs
had
vanished
reckless
and
unscrupulous
as
i
am
he
went
on
i
can
not
bear
to
think
of
my
brother
family
beggars
because
of
my
wrong
or
my
father
in
his
extreme
old
age
turned
out
from
under
his
own
roof
and
driven
into
the
and
yet
it
must
come
as
certainly
as
the
sun
will
rise
tomorrow
the
man
voice
trembled
now
and
the
flabby
muscles
of
his
face
quivered
in
despair
i
gathered
up
all
the
funds
of
the
county
remaining
in
my
hands
and
hurried
to
this
city
here
i
went
to
the
most
reliable
broker
i
could
find
and
through
him
plunged
into
speculation
but
all
the
devils
in
hell
seemed
to
be
fighting
for
my
ruin
i
was
caught
in
that
dread
and
unexpected
crash
of
yesterday
and
lost
everything
strange
to
say
when
i
realized
that
my
ruin
was
now
complete
i
felt
a
kind
of
exhilaration
such
i
presume
as
is
said
to
come
to
men
when
they
are
about
to
be
executed
standing
in
the
very
gaping
jaws
of
ruin
i
have
been
facetious
even
merry
now
in
the
full
glare
of
this
horrible
matter
i
scarcely
remember
what
i
have
been
doing
or
how
i
came
to
be
here
except
that
this
morning
in
wall
street
i
heard
some
one
speak
of
your
ability
and
i
hunted
up
your
address
and
came
without
any
well
defined
plan
and
if
you
will
pardon
me
i
will
add
that
it
was
also
without
any
hope
the
man
stopped
and
seemed
to
settle
back
in
his
chair
in
a
great
heap
randolph
mason
arose
and
stood
looking
down
at
the
virginian
sir
said
mason
none
are
ever
utterly
lost
but
the
weak
answer
my
question
the
virginian
pulled
himself
together
and
looked
up
is
there
any
large
fund
continued
mason
in
the
hands
of
the
officers
of
your
county
my
successor
said
allen
has
just
collected
the
amount
of
a
levy
ordered
by
the
county
court
for
the
purpose
of
paying
the
remainder
due
on
the
he
now
has
that
fund
in
his
hands
when
was
the
building
erected
said
mason
it
was
built
during
the
last
year
of
my
term
of
office
and
paid
for
in
part
out
of
levies
ordered
while
i
was
active
sheriff
when
my
successor
came
in
there
still
remained
due
the
contractors
on
the
work
some
thirty
thousand
dollars
a
levy
was
ordered
by
the
court
shortly
before
my
term
expired
but
the
collection
of
this
levy
fell
to
the
coming
officer
so
this
money
is
not
in
my
hands
although
all
the
business
up
to
this
time
has
been
managed
by
me
and
the
other
payments
on
the
building
made
from
time
to
time
out
of
moneys
in
my
hands
and
i
have
been
the
chief
manager
of
the
entire
work
and
know
more
about
it
than
any
one
else
the
new
sheriff
came
into
my
office
a
few
days
ago
to
inquire
how
he
was
to
dispose
of
this
money
mason
sat
down
abruptly
sir
he
said
almost
bitterly
there
is
not
enough
difficulty
in
your
matter
to
bother
the
cheapest
intriguer
in
kings
county
i
had
hoped
that
yours
was
a
problem
of
some
gravity
i
see
said
the
virginian
sarcastically
i
am
to
rob
the
sheriff
of
this
money
in
such
a
manner
that
it
wo
be
known
who
received
it
and
square
my
accounts
that
would
be
very
easy
indeed
i
would
have
only
to
kill
three
men
and
break
a
bank
yes
that
would
be
very
easy
you
might
as
well
tell
me
to
have
blue
eyes
sir
said
randolph
mason
slowly
you
are
the
worst
prophet
unhung
well
continued
the
man
there
can
be
no
other
way
if
it
were
turned
over
to
me
in
my
official
capacity
what
good
would
it
do
my
bondsmen
would
be
responsible
for
it
i
would
then
have
it
to
account
for
and
what
difference
in
god
name
can
it
make
whether
i
am
sent
to
the
penitentiary
for
stealing
money
which
i
have
already
used
or
for
stealing
this
money
it
all
belongs
to
the
county
it
is
two
times
six
one
way
and
six
times
two
the
other
way
sir
said
mason
i
retract
my
former
statement
in
regard
to
your
strong
point
let
me
insist
that
you
devote
your
time
to
prophecy
your
reasoning
is
atrocious
i
am
wasting
my
time
here
muttered
the
virginian
there
is
no
way
out
of
it
randolph
mason
turned
upon
the
man
are
you
afraid
of
courts
he
growled
no
said
the
southerner
i
am
afraid
of
nothing
but
the
penitentiary
then
said
mason
leaning
over
on
the
table
listen
to
me
and
you
will
never
see
the
shadow
of
it
iv
i
suppose
you
are
right
about
that
said
jacob
wade
the
newly
elected
sheriff
of
gullmore
county
as
he
and
colonel
moseby
allen
sat
in
the
office
of
that
shrewd
and
courteous
official
i
suppose
it
makes
no
difference
which
one
of
us
takes
this
money
and
pays
the
contractors
we
are
both
under
good
bonds
you
know
certainly
wade
certainly
put
in
the
colonel
your
bond
is
as
good
as
they
can
be
made
in
gullmore
county
and
i
mean
no
disrespect
to
the
omnipotent
ruler
of
the
universe
when
i
assert
that
the
whole
kingdom
of
heaven
could
not
give
a
better
bond
than
i
have
you
are
right
wade
you
are
always
right
you
are
away
ahead
of
the
ringleaders
of
your
party
i
do
mind
if
i
do
say
so
of
course
i
am
on
the
other
side
but
it
was
miraculous
i
tell
you
the
way
you
swung
your
forces
into
line
in
the
last
election
by
all
the
limping
gods
of
the
calendar
we
could
not
touch
you
colonel
moseby
allen
leaned
over
and
patted
his
companion
on
the
shoulder
you
are
a
sly
dog
wade
he
continued
if
it
had
not
been
for
you
we
would
have
beaten
the
bluebells
of
scotland
out
of
the
farmers
who
were
trying
to
run
your
party
i
told
the
boys
you
would
pull
the
whole
ticket
over
with
you
but
they
did
believe
me
next
time
they
will
have
more
regard
for
the
opinion
of
moseby
allen
of
the
colonel
burst
out
into
a
great
roar
of
laughter
and
brought
his
fat
hand
down
heavily
on
his
knee
jacob
wade
the
new
sheriff
was
a
countryman
with
a
face
that
indicated
honesty
and
egotism
he
had
come
up
from
a
farm
and
had
but
little
knowledge
of
business
methods
in
general
and
no
idea
of
how
the
duties
of
his
office
should
be
properly
performed
he
puffed
up
visibly
under
the
bald
flattery
of
allen
and
took
it
all
in
like
a
sponge
well
said
wade
i
suppose
the
boys
did
sort
of
expect
me
to
help
them
over
and
i
guess
i
did
i
have
been
getting
ready
to
run
for
a
long
time
and
i
aint
been
doing
no
fool
things
when
the
farmers
alliance
people
was
organizing
i
just
stayed
close
home
and
sawed
wood
and
when
the
county
was
all
stirred
up
about
that
there
dog
tax
i
kept
my
mouth
shut
and
never
said
nothing
that
what
you
did
wade
continued
the
colonel
rubbing
his
hands
you
are
too
smooth
to
get
yourself
mixed
up
with
a
lot
of
notions
that
would
brand
you
all
over
the
whole
county
as
a
crank
what
a
man
wants
in
order
to
run
for
the
office
of
sheriff
is
a
reputation
for
being
a
square
solid
substantial
business
man
and
that
is
what
you
had
wade
and
besides
that
you
were
a
smooth
shrewd
machine
politician
jacob
wade
flushed
and
grew
pompous
under
this
eloquent
recital
of
his
alleged
virtues
allen
was
handling
his
man
with
skill
he
was
a
natural
judge
of
men
and
possessed
in
no
little
degree
the
rare
ability
of
knowing
how
to
approach
the
individual
in
order
to
gain
his
confidence
and
goodwill
no
he
went
on
i
am
not
partisan
enough
to
prevent
me
from
appreciating
a
good
clearheaded
politician
no
matter
what
his
party
affiliations
may
be
i
am
as
firm
and
true
to
my
principles
as
any
of
those
high
up
in
the
affairs
of
state
i
have
been
honored
by
my
party
time
and
again
in
the
history
of
this
commonwealth
and
have
defended
and
supported
her
policies
on
the
stump
and
in
the
halls
of
legislation
and
i
know
a
smooth
man
when
i
see
him
and
i
honor
him
and
stick
to
him
out
of
pure
love
for
his
intelligence
and
genius
the
colonel
arose
he
now
felt
that
his
man
was
in
the
proper
humor
to
give
ready
assent
to
the
proposition
which
he
had
made
and
he
turned
back
to
it
with
careless
indifference
now
jacob
he
said
lowering
his
voice
this
is
not
all
talk
you
are
a
new
officer
and
i
am
an
old
one
i
am
familiar
with
all
the
routine
business
of
the
sheriffalty
and
i
am
ready
and
willing
and
anxious
to
give
all
the
information
that
can
be
of
any
benefit
to
you
and
to
do
any
and
everything
in
my
power
to
make
your
term
of
office
as
pleasant
and
profitable
as
it
can
be
made
i
am
wholly
and
utterly
at
your
service
and
want
you
to
feel
that
you
are
more
than
welcome
to
command
me
in
any
manner
you
see
fit
by
the
way
here
is
this
matter
that
we
were
just
discussing
i
am
perfectly
familiar
with
all
that
business
i
looked
after
the
building
for
the
county
collected
all
the
previous
levies
and
know
all
about
the
contracts
with
the
builders
just
what
is
due
each
one
and
just
how
the
settlements
are
to
be
made
and
i
am
willing
to
take
charge
of
this
fund
and
settle
the
thing
up
i
suppose
legally
it
is
my
duty
to
attend
to
this
work
as
it
is
in
the
nature
of
unfinished
business
of
my
term
but
i
could
have
shifted
the
whole
thing
over
on
you
and
gotten
out
of
the
trouble
of
making
the
final
settlements
with
the
contractors
the
levy
was
ordered
during
my
term
but
has
been
collected
by
you
and
on
that
ground
i
could
have
washed
my
hands
of
the
troublesome
matter
if
i
had
been
disposed
to
be
ugly
but
i
am
not
that
kind
of
a
man
wade
i
am
willing
to
shoulder
my
lawful
duties
and
wind
this
thing
up
and
leave
your
office
clear
and
free
from
any
old
matters
jacob
wade
sheriff
of
gullmore
county
was
now
thoroughly
convinced
of
two
things
first
that
he
himself
was
a
shrewd
politician
with
an
intellect
of
almost
colossal
proportions
and
second
that
colonel
moseby
allen
was
a
great
and
good
man
who
was
offering
to
do
him
a
service
out
of
sheer
kindness
of
heart
he
arose
and
seized
allen
hand
i
am
obliged
to
you
colonel
greatly
obliged
to
you
he
said
i
do
know
much
about
these
matters
yet
and
it
will
save
me
a
deal
of
trouble
if
you
will
allow
me
to
turn
this
thing
over
to
you
and
let
you
settle
it
up
i
reckon
from
the
standpoint
of
law
it
is
a
part
of
your
old
business
as
sheriff
yes
answered
allen
smiling
broadly
i
reckon
it
is
and
i
reckon
i
ought
to
shirk
it
all
right
said
wade
turning
to
leave
the
office
i
just
hand
the
whole
thing
over
to
you
in
the
morning
then
he
went
out
the
closed
the
door
sat
down
in
his
chair
and
put
his
feet
on
the
table
well
moseby
my
boy
he
said
that
was
dead
easy
the
honorable
jacob
wade
is
certainly
the
most
irresponsible
idiot
west
of
the
alleghany
mountains
he
ought
to
have
a
committee
yes
he
ought
to
have
two
committees
one
to
run
him
and
one
to
run
his
business
then
he
rubbed
his
hands
gleefully
it
is
working
like
a
greased
clock
he
chuckled
and
by
the
grace
of
god
and
the
continental
congress
when
this
funeral
procession
does
finally
start
it
wont
be
colonel
moseby
allen
of
the
county
of
gullmore
who
will
occupy
the
hearse
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
could
never
imagine
the
vast
interest
aroused
in
the
county
of
gullmore
by
the
trial
of
colonel
moseby
allen
for
embezzlement
in
all
their
quiet
lives
the
good
citizens
had
not
been
treated
to
such
a
sweeping
tidal
wave
of
excitement
the
annual
visits
of
the
greatest
show
on
earth
were
scarcely
able
to
fan
the
interests
of
the
countrymen
into
such
a
flame
the
news
of
arrest
had
spread
through
the
country
like
wildfire
men
had
talked
of
nothing
else
from
the
moment
this
startling
information
had
come
to
their
ears
the
crowds
on
saturday
afternoons
at
the
country
store
had
constituted
themselves
courts
of
first
and
last
resort
and
had
passed
on
the
matter
of
the
guilt
at
great
length
and
with
great
show
of
learning
the
village
blacksmith
had
delivered
ponderous
opinions
while
he
shod
the
traveller
horse
and
the
ubiquitous
justice
of
the
peace
had
demonstrated
time
and
again
with
huge
solemnity
that
moseby
allen
was
a
great
criminal
and
by
no
possible
means
could
be
saved
from
conviction
it
was
the
general
belief
that
the
would
not
stand
trial
that
he
would
by
some
means
escape
from
the
jail
where
he
was
confined
so
had
this
conviction
become
that
the
great
crowd
gathered
in
the
little
county
seat
on
the
day
fixed
for
the
trial
were
considerably
astonished
when
they
saw
the
sitting
in
the
dock
in
the
evening
after
the
first
day
of
the
trial
in
which
certain
wholly
unexpected
things
had
come
to
pass
the
crowd
gathered
on
the
porch
of
the
country
hotel
were
fairly
revelling
in
the
huge
sensation
duncan
hatfield
a
long
ungainly
mountaineer
wearing
a
red
and
a
pair
of
blue
jeans
trousers
was
evidently
the
of
the
occasion
i
tell
you
boys
he
was
saying
old
moseby
aint
got
no
more
show
than
a
calliker
apron
in
a
brush
fire
why
he
jest
laid
down
and
give
up
jest
naturally
lopped
his
ears
and
give
up
like
a
whipped
dog
yes
put
in
an
old
farmer
who
was
standing
a
little
back
in
the
crowd
i
reckon
nobody
calkerlated
on
jest

a
fizzle
when
he
come
into
court
this
mornin
continued
the
oracle
with
that
there
young
lawyer
man
edwards
i
poked
lum
bozier
in
the
side
and
told
him
to
keep
his
eye
skinned

he
would
see
the
fur

because
i
knowed
that
sam
lynch
the
prosecutin
attorney
allowed
to
go
fer
old
moseby
and
sam

that

to
this
yer
town
edwards
jest
sot
down
and
lopped
over
like
a
weed
and
sam
he
begun
and
he
showed
up
how
old
moseby
had
planned
this
here
thing
and
how
he
had
lied
to
jake
wade
all
the
way
through
and
jest
how
he
got
that
there
money
and
what
an
everlasting
old
rascal
he
was
and
there
sot
edwards
and
he
never
asked
no
questions
and
he
never
paid
no
attention
to
nuthin
did
the
lawyer
feller
do
nuthin
at
all
dunk
enquired
one
of
the
audience
who
had
evidently
suffered
the
great
misfortune
of
being
absent
from
the
trial
no
answered
the
oracle
with
a
bovine
sneer
he
never
did
nothin
till
late
this
evenin
then
he
untangled
his
legs
and
got
up
and
said
somethin
to
the
jedge
about
havin
to
let
old
moseby
allen
go
cause
what
he
had
done
was
no
crime
then
you
ought
to
a
heard

he
jest
naturally
took
the
roof
off
he
sailed
into
old
moseby
he
called
him
nine
different
kinds
of
and
when
he
got
through
i
could
see
old
ampe
props
noddin
his
head
back
thar
in
the
and
then
i
knowed
that
it
were
all
up
with
colonel
moseby
allen
cause
that
jury
will
go
the
way
old
ampe
goes
jest
like
a
pack
of
sheep
i
reckon
moseby

skeered
out
suggested
pooley
hornick
the
blacksmith
i
reckon
he
war
continued
the
oracle
cause
when
sam
sot
down
he
got
up
and
he
said
to
the
jedge
that
he
did
want
to
do
no
argufying
but
he
had
a
little
paper
that
would
show
why
the
jedge
would
have
to
let
old
moseby
go
free
and
then
he
asked
sam
if
he
wanted
to
see
it
and
sam
he
said
no
he
cared
nuthin
for
his
little
paper
then
the
feller
went
over
and
give
the
little
paper
to
the
jedge
and
the
jedge
he
took
it
and
he
said
he
would
decide
in
the
mornin
you
do
reckon
said
the
farmer
that
the
jedge
will
give
the
old
colonel
any
show
do
you
billdad
solsberry
said
the
oracle
with
a
grave
judicial
air
as
though
to
settle
the
matter
beyond
question
you
are
a
plumb
fool
if
the
angel
gabriel
war
to
drop
down
into
gullmore
county
he
could
keep
old
moseby
allen
from
goin
to
the
penitentiary
thus
the
good
citizens
sat
in
judgment
and
foretold
the
doom
of
their
fellow
vi
on
monday
night
the
eleventh
day
of
may
in
the
year
of
the
state
of
west
virginia
the
judge
of
the
criminal
court
of
gullmore
county
and
the
judge
of
the
circuit
court
of
gullmore
county
were
to
meet
together
for
the
purpose
of
deciding
two
matters
one
relating
to
the
trial
of
moseby
allen
the
retiring
sheriff
for
embezzling
funds
of
the
county
amounting
to
thirty
thousand
dollars
and
the
other
an
action
pending
in
the
circuit
court
wherein
the
state
of
west
virginia
at
the
relation
of
jacob
wade
was
seeking
to
recover
this
sum
from
the
bondsmen
of
allen
in
neither
of
the
two
cases
was
there
any
serious
doubt
as
to
the
facts
it
seemed
that
it
was
customary
for
the
retiring
sheriff
to
retain
an
office
in
the
court
building
after
the
installation
of
his
successor
and
continue
to
attend
to
the
unfinished
business
of
the
county
until
all
his
settlements
had
been
made
and
until
all
the
matters
relating
to
his
term
of
office
had
been
finally
wound
up
and
administered
in
accordance
with
this
custom
moseby
allen
after
the
expiration
of
his
term
had
continued
in
his
office
in
a
capacity
in
order
to
collect
back
taxes
and
settle
up
all
matters
carried
over
from
his
regular
term
it
appeared
that
during
allen
term
of
office
the
county
had
built
a
and
had
ordered
certain
levies
for
the
purpose
of
raising
the
necessary
funds
the
first
of
the
levies
had
been
collected
by
allen
and
paid
over
by
him
to
the
contractors
as
directed
by
the
county
court
the
remaining
levies
had
not
been
collected
during
his
term
but
had
been
collected
by
the
new
sheriff
immediately
after
his
installation
this
money
amounting
to
some
thirty
thousand
dollars
had
been
turned
over
to
allen
upon
his
claim
that
it
grew
out
of
the
unfinished
affairs
of
his
term
and
that
therefore
he
was
entitled
to
its
custody
he
had
said
to
the
new
sheriff
that
the
levy
upon
which
it
had
been
raised
was
ordered
during
his
term
and
the
work
for
which
it
was
to
be
paid
all
performed
and
the
bonds
of
the
county
issued
while
he
was
active
sheriff
and
that
he
believed
it
was
a
part
of
the
matters
which
were
involved
in
his
final
settlements
jacob
wade
then
sheriff
believing
that
allen
was
in
fact
the
proper
person
to
rightly
administer
this
fund
and
knowing
that
his
bond
to
the
county
was
good
and
would
cover
all
his
official
affairs
had
turned
the
entire
fund
over
to
him
and
paid
no
further
attention
to
the
matter
it
appeared
that
at
the
end
of
the
year
moseby
allen
had
made
all
of
his
proper
and
legitimate
settlements
fully
and
satisfactorily
and
had
accounted
to
the
proper
authorities
for
every
dollar
that
had
been
collected
by
him
during
his
term
of
office
but
had
refused
and
neglected
to
account
for
the
money
which
he
had
received
from
wade
when
approached
upon
the
subject
he
had
said
plainly
that
he
had
used
this
money
in
unfortunate
speculations
and
could
not
return
it
the
man
had
made
no
effort
to
check
the
storm
of
indignation
that
burst
upon
him
he
firmly
refused
to
discuss
the
matter
or
to
give
any
information
in
regard
to
it
when
arrested
he
had
expressed
no
surprise
and
had
gone
to
the
jail
with
the
officer
at
the
trial
his
attorney
had
simply
waited
until
the
evidence
had
been
introduced
and
had
then
arisen
and
moved
the
court
to
direct
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
on
the
ground
that
allen
upon
the
facts
shown
had
committed
no
crime
punishable
under
the
statutes
of
west
virginia
the
court
had
been
strongly
disposed
to
overrule
this
motion
without
stopping
to
consider
it
but
the
attorney
had
insisted
that
a
memorandum
which
he
handed
up
would
sustain
his
position
and
that
without
mature
consideration
the
judge
ought
not
to
force
him
into
the
superior
court
whereupon
his
honor
ephraim
haines
had
taken
the
matter
under
advisement
until
morning
in
the
circuit
court
the
question
had
been
raised
that
allen
bond
covered
only
those
matters
which
arose
by
virtue
of
his
office
and
that
this
fund
was
not
properly
included
whereupon
the
careful
judge
of
that
court
had
adjourned
to
consider
it
was
almost
nine
when
the
honorable
ephraim
haines
walked
into
the
library
to
consult
with
his
colleague
of
the
civil
court
he
found
that
methodical
jurist
seated
before
a
pile
of
reports
with
his
spectacles
far
out
on
the
end
of
his
nose
an
indication
as
the
said
haines
well
knew
that
the
said
jurist
had
arrived
at
a
decision
and
was
now
carefully
turning
it
over
in
his
mind
in
order
to
be
certain
that
it
was
in
spirit
and
truth
the
very
law
of
the
land
well
judge
said
haines
have
you
flipped
the
penny
on
it
and
if
so
who
wins
the
man
addressed
looked
up
from
his
book
and
removed
his
spectacles
he
was
an
angular
man
with
a
grave
analytical
face
it
is
not
a
question
of
who
wins
haines
he
answered
it
is
a
question
of
law
i
was
fairly
satisfied
when
the
objection
was
first
made
but
i
wanted
to
be
certain
before
i
rendered
my
decision
i
have
gone
over
the
authorities
and
there
is
no
question
about
the
matter
the
bondsmen
of
allen
are
not
liable
in
this
action
they
are
not
said
haines
dropping
his
long
body
down
into
a
chair
it
is
public
money
and
the
object
of
the
bond
is
certainly
to
cover
any
defalcations
this
bond
continued
the
circuit
judge
provides
for
the
faithful
discharge
according
to
law
of
the
duties
of
the
office
of
sheriff
during
his
continuance
in
said
office
moseby
allen
ceased
to
be
sheriff
of
this
county
the
day
his
successor
was
installed
and
on
that
day
this
bond
ceased
to
cover
his
acts
this
money
was
handed
over
by
the
lawful
sheriff
to
a
man
who
was
not
then
an
officer
of
this
county
moseby
allen
had
no
legal
right
to
the
custody
of
this
money
his
duties
as
sheriff
had
ceased
his
official
acts
had
all
determined
and
there
was
no
possible
way
whereby
he
could
then
perform
an
official
act
that
would
render
his
bondsmen
liable
the
action
pending
must
be
dismissed
the
present
sheriff
wade
is
the
one
responsible
to
the
county
for
this
money
his
only
recourse
is
an
action
of
debt
or
assumpsit
against
allen
individually
and
as
allen
is
notoriously
insolvent
wade
and
his
bondsmen
will
have
to
make
up
this
deficit
well
said
haines
that
is
hard
luck
no
answered
the
judge
it
is
not
luck
at
all
it
is
law
wade
permitted
himself
to
be
the
dupe
of
a
shrewd
knave
and
he
must
bear
the
consequences
you
can
depend
upon
it
said
the
honorable
ephraim
haines
criminal
judge
by
a
political
error
that
old
allen
wo
get
off
so
easy
with
me
the
jury
will
convict
him
and
i
will
land
him
for
the
full
term
i
was
under
the
impression
said
the
circuit
judge
gravely
that
a
motion
had
been
made
in
your
court
to
direct
an
acquittal
on
the
ground
that
no
crime
had
been
committed
it
was
said
haines
but
of
course
it
was
made
as
a
matter
of
form
and
there
is
nothing
in
it
have
you
considered
it
what
is
the
use
it
is
a
fool
motion
well
continued
the
judge
this
matter
comes
up
from
your
court
to
mine
on
appeal
and
you
should
be
correct
in
your
ruling
what
authorities
were
cited
here
is
the
memorandum
said
the
criminal
judge
you
can
run
down
the
cases
if
you
want
to
but
i
know
it
is
no
use
the
money
belonged
to
the
county
and
old
allen
embezzled
it
that
is
admitted
to
this
the
circuit
judge
did
not
reply
he
took
the
memorandum
which
randolph
mason
had
prepared
for
allen
and
which
the
local
attorney
had
submitted
and
turned
to
the
cases
of
reports
behind
him
he
was
a
conscientious
man
and
not
least
among
his
vexatious
cares
were
the
reckless
decisions
of
the
honorable
ephraim
haines
the
learned
judge
of
the
criminal
court
put
his
feet
on
the
table
and
began
to
whistle
when
at
length
wearied
of
this
intellectual
diversion
he
concentrated
all
the
energy
of
his
mammoth
faculties
on
the
highly
cultured
pastime
of
sharpening
his
penknife
on
the
back
of
the
code
at
length
the
judge
of
the
circuit
court
came
back
to
the
table
sat
down
and
adjusted
his
spectacles
haines
he
said
slowly
you
will
have
to
sustain
that
motion
what
cried
the
honorable
ephraim
bringing
the
legs
of
his
chair
down
on
the
floor
with
a
bang
that
motion
continued
the
judge
must
be
sustained
moseby
allen
has
committed
no
crime
under
the
statutes
of
west
virginia
committed
no
crime
almost
shouted
the
criminal
jurist
doubling
his
long
legs
up
under
his
chair
why
old
allen
admits
that
he
got
this
money
and
spent
it
he
says
that
he
converted
it
to
his
own
use
that
it
was
not
his
money
that
it
belonged
to
the
county
the
evidence
of
the
state
shows
that
he
cunningly
induced
wade
to
turn
this
money
over
to
him
saying
that
his
bond
was
good
and
that
he
was
entitled
to
the
custody
of
the
fund
the
old
rascal
secured
the
possession
of
this
money
by
trickery
and
kept
it
and
now
you
say
he
has
committed
no
crime
how
in
satan
name
do
you
figure
it
out
haines
said
the
judge
gravely
i
do
figure
it
out
the
law
can
not
be
figured
out
it
is
certain
and
exact
it
describes
perfectly
what
wrongs
are
punishable
as
crimes
and
exactly
what
elements
must
enter
into
each
wrong
in
order
to
make
it
a
crime
all
right
of
discretion
is
taken
from
the
trial
court
the
judge
must
abide
by
the
law
and
the
law
decides
matters
of
this
nature
in
no
uncertain
terms
surely
interrupted
haines
beginning
to
appreciate
the
gravity
of
the
situation
old
allen
can
be
sent
to
the
penitentiary
for
this
crime
he
is
a
rank
out
and
out
embezzler
he
stole
this
money
and
converted
it
to
his
own
use
are
you
going
to
say
that
the
crime
of
embezzlement
is
a
dead
letter
my
friend
said
the
judge
you
forget
that
there
is
no
equity
in
the
criminal
courts
the
crime
of
embezzlement
is
a
pure
creature
of
the
statute
under
the
old
common
law
there
was
no
such
crime
consequently
society
had
no
protection
from
wrongs
of
this
nature
until
this
evil
grew
to
such
proportions
that
the
power
began
by
statute
to
define
this
crime
and
provide
for
its
punishment
the
ancient
english
statutes
were
many
and
varied
and
following
in
some
degree
thereafter
each
of
the
united
states
has
its
own
particular
statute
describing
this
crime
as
being
composed
of
certain
fixed
technical
elements
this
indictment
against
moseby
allen
is
brought
under
section
of
chapter
of
the
code
of
west
virginia
which
provides
any
officer
agent
clerk
or
servant
of
this
state
or
of
any
county
district
school
district
or
municipal
corporation
thereof
or
of
any
incorporated
bank
or
other
corporation
or
any
officer
of
public
trust
in
this
state
or
any
agent
clerk
or
servant
of
such
officer
of
public
trust
or
any
agent
clerk
or
servant
of
any
firm
or
person
or
company
or
association
of
persons
not
incorporated
embezzle
or
fraudulently
convert
to
his
own
use
bullion
money
bank
notes
or
other
security
for
money
or
any
effects
or
property
of
another
person
which
shall
have
come
to
his
possession
or
been
placed
under
his
care
or
management
by
virtue
of
his
office
place
or
employment
he
shall
be
guilty
of
larceny
thereof
this
is
the
statute
describing
the
offence
sought
to
be
charged
all
such
statutes
must
be
strictly
construed
applying
these
requisites
of
the
crime
to
the
case
before
us
we
find
that
allen
can
not
be
convicted
for
the
reason
that
at
the
time
this
money
was
placed
in
his
hands
he
was
not
sheriff
of
gullmore
county
nor
was
he
in
any
sense
its
agent
clerk
or
servant
and
second
if
he
could
be
said
to
continue
an
agent
clerk
or
servant
of
this
county
after
the
expiration
of
his
term
he
would
continue
such
agent
clerk
or
servant
for
the
purpose
only
of
administering
those
matters
which
might
be
said
to
lawfully
pertain
to
the
unfinished
business
of
his
office
this
fund
was
in
no
wise
connected
with
such
unfinished
affairs
and
by
no
possible
construction
could
he
be
said
to
be
an
agent
clerk
or
servant
of
this
county
for
the
purpose
of
its
distribution
or
custody
again
in
order
to
constitute
such
embezzlement
the
money
must
have
come
into
his
possession
by
virtue
of
his
office
this
could
not
be
for
the
reason
that
he
held
no
office
his
time
had
expired
jacob
wade
was
sheriff
and
the
moment
jacob
wade
was
installed
allen
official
capacity
determined
and
he
became
a
private
citizen
with
only
the
rights
and
liabilities
of
such
a
citizen
nor
is
he
guilty
of
larceny
for
the
very
evident
reason
that
the
proper
custodian
wade
voluntarily
placed
this
money
in
his
hands
and
he
received
it
under
a
color
of
right
the
honorable
ephraim
haines
arose
and
brought
his
ponderous
fist
down
violently
on
the
table
by
the
eternal
he
said
this
is
the
cutest
trick
that
has
been
played
in
the
two
virginias
for
a
century
moseby
allen
has
slipped
out
of
the
clutches
of
the
law
like
an
eel
ephraim
said
the
circuit
judge
reproachfully
this
is
no
frivolous
matter
moseby
allen
has
wrought
a
great
wrong
by
which
many
innocent
men
will
suffer
vast
injury
perhaps
ruin
such
malicious
cunning
is
dangerous
to
society
justice
can
not
reach
all
wrongs
its
hands
are
tied
by
the
restrictions
of
the
law
why
under
this
very
statute
one
who
was
an
officer
of
the
county
or
state
by
inducing
some
other
officer
to
place
in
his
hands
funds
to
which
he
was
not
legally
entitled
could
appropriate
the
funds
so
received
with
perfect
impunity
and
without
committing
any
crime
or
rendering
his
bondsmen
liable
thus
a
clerk
of
the
circuit
court
could
use
without
criminal
liability
any
money
properly
belonging
to
the
clerk
of
the
county
court
or
sheriff
provided
he
could
convince
the
clerk
or
sheriff
that
he
was
entitled
to
its
custody
and
so
with
any
officer
of
the
state
or
county
and
this
could
be
done
with
perfect
ease
where
the
officers
were
well
known
to
each
other
and
strict
business
methods
were
not
observed
hence
all
the
great
wrong
and
injury
of
embezzlement
can
be
committed
and
all
the
gain
and
profit
of
it
be
secured
without
violating
the
statute
or
rendering
the
officer
liable
to
criminal
prosecution
it
would
seem
that
the
rogue
must
be
stupid
indeed
who
could
not
evade
the
crime
of
embezzlement
the
man
stopped
removed
his
spectacles
and
closed
them
up
in
their
case
he
was
a
painstaking
honest
servant
of
the
commonwealth
and
like
many
others
of
the
uncomplaining
strong
performed
his
own
duties
and
those
of
his
careless
companion
without
murmur
or
comment
or
hope
of
reward
the
honorable
ephraim
haines
arose
and
drew
himself
up
pompously
i
am
glad
he
said
that
we
agree
on
this
matter
i
shall
sustain
this
motion
the
circuit
judge
smiled
grimly
yes
he
said
it
is
not
reason
or
justice
but
it
is
the
law
at
twelve
the
following
night
colonel
moseby
allen
of
the
county
of
gullmore
now
acquitted
of
crime
by
the
commonwealth
hurried
across
the
border
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
certain
lawless
demonstrations
on
the
part
of
his
countrymen
and
of
all
his
acts
of
public
service
this
was
the
greatest
the
animus
furandi
see
the
case
of

the
strange
case
of

i
am
tired
of
your
devilish
hints
why
ca
you
come
out
with
it
man
the
speaker
was
half
angry
parks
leaned
forward
on
the
table
his
face
was
narrow
and
full
of
cunning
mystery
is
your
long
suit
hogarth
i
compliment
you
you
tire
me
said
the
man
if
you
have
any
reason
for
bringing
me
here
at
this
hour
of
the
night
i
want
to
know
it
would
i
be
here
in
the
office
at
two
in
the
morning
with
a
detective
and
without
a
reason
listen
i
will
be
plain
with
you
i
must
get
mason
out
of
new
york
he
is
going
rapidly
and
unless
he
gets
a
and
a
change
of
country
he
will
be
in
the
he
is
terribly
thin
and
scarcely
sleeps
any
more
at
all
no
human
being
can
imagine
what
a
monster
he
is
to
manage
or
in
what
an
infinitely
difficult
position
i
have
been
placed
when
we
came
here
from
paris
after
the
unfortunate
collapse
of
the
canal
syndicate
the
situation
that
confronted
me
was
of
the
most
desperate
character
mason
was
practically
a
bankrupt
he
had
spent
his
entire
fortune
in
a
mighty
effort
to
right
the
syndicate
and
would
have
succeeded
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
treachery
of
some
of
the
french
officials
he
had
been
absent
so
long
from
new
york
that
his
law
practice
was
now
entirely
lost
and
worst
of
all
this
mysterious
tilt
of
his
mind
would
render
it
utterly
impossible
for
him
ever
to
regain
his
clientage
for
a
time
i
was
in
despair
mason
was
of
course
utterly
oblivious
to
the
situation
and
there
was
no
one
with
whom
i
could
advise
even
if
i
dared
attempt
it
when
everything
failed
in
paris
mason
collapsed
physically
he
was
in
the
hospital
for
months
when
he
came
out
his
whole
nature
was
wrenched
into
this
strange
groove
although
his
mind
was
apparently
as
keen
and
powerful
as
ever
and
his
wonderful
faculties
unimpaired
he
seemed
now
possessed
by
this
one
idea
that
all
the
difficulties
of
men
were
problems
and
that
he
could
solve
them
a
few
days
after
we
landed
in
new
york
i
wandered
into
the
a
great
criminal
had
been
apprehended
and
was
being
tried
for
a
desperate
crime
i
sat
down
and
listened
as
the
case
developed
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
man
had
botched
his
work
fearfully
and
that
if
he
could
have
had
mason
plan
his
crime
for
him
he
need
never
have
been
punished
then
the
inspiration
came
why
not
turn
this
idea
of
mason
to
account
i
knew
that
the
city
was
filled
with
shrewd
desperate
men
who
feared
nothing
under
high
heaven
but
the
law
and
were
willing
to
take
desperate
chances
with
it
i
went
to
some
of
them
and
pointed
out
the
mighty
aid
that
i
could
give
they
hooted
at
the
idea
and
said
that
crime
was
crime
and
the
old
ways
were
the
best
ways
parks
paused
and
looked
up
at
the
detective
they
have
since
changed
their
minds
he
added
what
did
mason
think
of
your
method
of
securing
clients
said
hogarth
that
was
my
greatest
difficulty
continued
parks
i
resorted
to
every
known
trick
in
order
to
prevent
him
from
learning
how
the
men
happened
to
come
to
him
and
so
far
i
have
been
successful
he
has
never
suspected
me
and
has
steadily
believed
that
those
who
came
to
him
with
difficulties
were
attracted
by
his
great
reputation
by
this
means
mason
has
made
vast
sums
of
money
but
what
he
has
done
with
it
is
a
mystery
i
have
attempted
to
save
what
i
could
but
i
have
not
enough
for
this
extended
trip
to
the
south
of
france
now
do
you
understand
me
yes
answered
the
detective
you
want
to
find
where
his
money
is
hidden
no
said
parks
with
a
queer
smile
i
am
not
seeking
impossible
ventures
what
randolph
mason
chooses
to
make
a
mystery
will
remain
so
to
the
end
of
time
all
the
detectives
on
the
earth
to
the
contrary
what
do
you
want
then
asked
hogarth
doggedly
parks
drew
his
chair
nearer
to
the
man
and
lowered
his
voice
my
friend
he
said
this
recent
change
in
the
administration
of
the
city
has
thrown
you
out
on
your
uppers
your
chief
is
gone
for
good
and
with
him
all
your
hopes
in
new
york
it
was
a
rout
my
friend
and
they
have
all
saved
themselves
but
you
what
is
to
become
of
you
god
knows
said
the
detective
of
course
i
am
still
a
member
of
the
agency
but
there
is
scarcely
bread
in
that
this
world
is
a
fighting
station
continued
parks
the
one
intention
of
the
entire
business
world
is
robbery
the
man
on
the
street
has
no
sense
of
pity
he
grows
rich
because
he
conceives
some
shrewd
scheme
by
which
he
is
enabled
to
seize
and
enjoy
the
labor
of
others
his
only
object
is
to
avoid
the
law
he
commits
the
same
wrong
and
causes
the
same
resulting
injury
as
the
pirate
the
word
hogarth
was
invented
by
the
strong
with
which
to
frighten
the
weak
it
means
nothing
now
listen
since
the
thing
is
a
cutthroat
game
why
not
have
our
share
of
the
spoil
hogarth
face
was
a
study
parks
was
shrewdly
forcing
the
right
door
my
friend
the
little
man
went
on
we
can
make
a
fortune
by
a
twist
of
the
wrist
and
go
with
the
double
eagles
clinking
in
our
pockets
we
can
make
it
in
a
day
and
thereafter
wag
our
heads
at
fortune
and
snap
our
fingers
at
the
law
how
asked
the
detective
the
door
had
broken
and
swung
in
i
will
tell
you
said
parks
placing
his
hand
confidentially
on
the
man
shoulder
mason
has
a
plan
i
know
it
because
yesterday
he
was
walking
up
broadway
apparently
oblivious
to
everything
suddenly
his
face
cleared
up
and
he
stopped
and
snapped
his
fingers
he
said
detective
could
do
it
and
it
would
be
child
play
child
play
hogarth
countenance
fell
is
that
all
he
said
all
echoed
parks
bringing
his
hand
down
on
the
table
is
that
enough
man
you
do
know
randolph
mason
if
he
has
a
plan
by
which
a
detective
can
make
a
haul
it
is
good
do
you
hear
and
it
goes
what
does
this
mean
parks
said
a
voice
the
little
clerk
sprang
up
and
whirled
round
in
his
vehemence
he
had
not
noticed
the
randolph
mason
stood
in
the
shadow
he
was
thin
and
haggard
his
face
was
shrunken
and
unshaven
and
he
looked
worn
and
exhausted
oh
sir
said
parks
gathering
himself
quickly
this
is
my
friend
braxton
hogarth
and
he
is
in
great
trouble
he
came
here
to
ask
me
for
help
we
have
been
talking
over
the
matter
for
many
hours
and
i
see
any
way
out
for
him
where
has
the
trap
caught
him
said
mason
coming
into
the
room
it
is
an
awful
strange
thing
sir
answered
the
clerk
only
son
is
the
teller
of
the
bay
state
bank
in
new
jersey
this
morning
they
found
that
twenty
thousand
dollars
was
missing
from
the
vault
no
one
had
access
to
the
vault
yesterday
but
young
hogarth
the
cashier
was
in
this
city
the
combination
was
not
known
to
any
others
there
is
no
evidence
of
robbery
the
circumstances
are
so
overwhelming
against
young
hogarth
that
the
directors
went
to
him
and
said
plainly
that
if
the
money
was
in
its
place
by
saturday
night
he
would
not
be
prosecuted
and
the
matter
would
be
hushed
up
he
protested
his
innocence
but
they
simply
laughed
and
would
not
listen
to
him
the
boy
is
prostrated
and
we
know
that
he
is
innocent
but
there
is
no
way
on
earth
to
save
him
unless
hogarth
can
raise
the
money
which
is
a
hopeless
impossibility
parks
paused
and
glanced
at
hogarth
the
kind
of
glance
that
obtains
among
criminals
when
they
mean
back
up
the
lie
the
detective
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
the
discretion
of
fate
is
superb
said
mason
she
strikes
always
the
vulnerable
spot
she
gives
wealth
if
one
does
not
need
it
fame
if
one
does
not
care
for
it
and
drives
in
the
harpoon
where
the
heart
is
the
strange
thing
about
it
all
sir
continued
parks
is
that
hogarth
has
been
a
detective
all
his
life
and
now
is
a
member
of
the
atlantic
agency
it
looks
like
the
trailed
thing
turning
on
him
a
detective
said
mason
sharply
ah
there
is
the
open
place
and
there
we
will
force
through
the
whole
appearance
of
the
man
changed
in
an
instant
he
straightened
up
and
his
face
lighted
with
interest
he
drew
up
a
chair
and
sat
down
at
the
table
and
there
in
the
chill
dark
of
that
november
morning
he
unfolded
the
daring
details
of
his
and
the
men
beside
him
stared
in
wonder
ii
about
one
on
thursday
afternoon
william
walson
manager
of
the
great
oceanic
coal
company
stepped
out
of
the
fairmont
banking
house
in
the
monongahela
mining
regions
of
west
virginia
it
was
at
his
mine
and
he
carried
a
black
leather
satchel
in
his
hand
containing
twenty
thousand
dollars
in
bills
at
this
time
the
gigantic
plant
of
this
company
was
doing
an
enormous
business
the
labor
unions
of
the
vast
pennsylvania
coal
regions
were
out
on
the
bitterest
and
most
protracted
strike
of
all
history
the
west
virginia
operators
were
moving
the
heavens
in
order
to
supply
the
market
every
man
who
could
hold
a
pick
was
at
work
under
the
earth
day
and
night
the
excitement
was
something
undreamed
of
the
region
was
overrun
with
straggling
workmen
tramps
hobos
and
the
scum
criminals
of
the
cities
and
was
transformed
as
if
by
magic
into
a
where
the
keen
human
ferret
stalked
the
crook
and
the
killer
with
that
high
degree
of
care
and
patience
which
obtains
only
with
the
william
walson
was
tall
with
short
red
beard
and
red
hair
black
eyes
and
rather
a
sharp
face
his
jaw
was
square
bespeaking
energy
but
his
expression
was
rather
that
of
a
man
who
won
by
the
milder
measures
of
conciliation
and
diplomacy
for
almost
a
month
he
had
been
taxing
his
physical
strength
to
the
uttermost
and
on
this
afternoon
he
looked
worn
and
tired
out
utterly
he
walked
hurriedly
from
the
bank
door
to
the
untied
the
horse
raised
the
seat
and
put
the
satchel
down
in
the
box
under
the
cushion
then
climbed
in
and
drove
away
the
great
plant
of
the
oceanic
coal
company
was
on
a
branch
of
the
railroad
some
considerable
distance
from
the
main
line
by
rail
but
only
a
few
miles
over
the
hills
from
the
fairmont
junction
william
walson
struck
out
across
the
country
road
the
sun
shone
warm
he
had
lost
so
much
sleep
that
presently
he
began
to
feel
drowsy
and
as
the
horse
jogged
along
he
nodded
in
his
seat
about
a
mile
from
the
town
at
the
foot
of
a
little
hill
in
the
woods
a
man
stepped
suddenly
out
from
the
fence
and
caught
the
horse
by
the
bridle
walson
started
and
looked
up
as
he
did
so
the
stranger
covered
him
with
a
revolver
and
bade
him
put
up
his
hands
and
get
out
of
the
the
coal
dealer
saw
in
a
moment
that
the
highwayman
meant
what
he
said
and
that
resistance
would
be
folly
he
concluded
also
that
he
was
confronted
by
one
of
the
many
toughs
at
large
in
the
neighborhood
and
that
the
fellow
intention
was
simply
to
rob
him
of
his
personal
effects
and
such
money
as
he
might
have
in
his
pockets
it
was
more
than
probable
that
the
man
before
him
had
no
knowledge
of
the
money
hidden
under
the
seat
and
would
never
discover
it
tie
your
horse
sir
said
the
highwayman
walson
loosed
the
hitch
strap
and
fastened
the
horse
to
a
small
tree
by
the
roadside
turn
your
back
to
me
said
the
robber
and
put
out
your
hands
behind
you
the
coal
dealer
obeyed
thinking
that
the
fellow
was
now
going
through
his
pockets
to
his
surprise
and
astonishment
the
man
came
up
close
behind
him
and
snapped
a
pair
of
handcuffs
on
his
wrists
what
do
you
mean
by
this
cried
watson
whirling
round
on
his
heels
the
big
man
with
the
revolver
grinned
you
will
find
out
soon
enough
he
said
move
along
the
walking
is
good
william
watson
was
utterly
at
sea
he
could
not
understand
why
this
man
should
kidnap
him
and
start
back
with
him
to
the
town
what
could
the
highwayman
possibly
mean
by
this
queer
move
at
any
rate
it
was
evident
that
he
had
no
knowledge
of
the
money
and
walson
reasoned
shrewdly
that
if
he
remained
quiet
and
submissive
the
vast
sum
in
the
would
escape
the
notice
of
this
erratic
thief
the
two
men
walked
along
in
silence
for
some
time
the
highwayman
was
big
with
keen
gray
eyes
and
a
shrewd
face
he
seemed
curiously
elated
when
the
two
came
finally
to
the
brow
of
the
hill
overlooking
the
town
walson
stopped
and
turned
to
his
strange
captor
he
was
now
convinced
that
the
fellow
was
a
lunatic
sir
he
said
what
in
heaven
name
are
you
trying
to
do
introduce
you
to
your
fellows
in
sing
sing
my
friend
answered
the
highwayman
the
gang
will
be
glad
to
welcome
red
lead
jim
it
all
came
to
the
coal
dealer
in
a
moment
oh
you
miserable
ass
he
cried
what
an
infernal
mistake
my
name
is
william
walson
i
am
the
manager
of
the
oceanic
coal
company
there
is
twenty
thousand
dollars
in
that
i
must
go
back
to
it
or
it
will
be
lost
here
take
off
these
damned
handcuffs
and
be
quick
about
it
and
he
literally
danced
up
and
down
in
the
road
with
rage
his
companion
leaned
against
the
fence
and
roared
with
laughter
you
are
a
smooth
one
red
but
the
job
and
your
twenty
thousand
will
keep
walson
face
changed
come
he
said
let
us
get
this
fool
business
over
and
he
began
to
run
down
the
hill
to
the
town
his
captor
following
close
beside
him
men
came
out
into
the
street
in
astonishment
when
they
saw
the
strange
pair
walson
was
dusty
and
cursing
like
a
pirate
he
called
upon
the
crowd
that
was
quickly
gathering
to
identify
him
and
arrest
his
idiotic
kidnapper
the
people
explained
that
walson
was
all
right
that
he
was
a
prominent
citizen
that
it
was
all
some
horrible
mistake
but
the
fellow
hung
on
to
his
man
until
he
got
him
to
the
jail
there
the
sheriff
freed
walson
and
demanded
an
explanation
the
mob
crowded
around
to
hear
what
it
all
meant
the
stranger
seemed
utterly
astonished
at
the
way
the
people
acted
he
said
that
his
name
was
braxton
hogarth
that
he
was
a
new
york
detective
an
employee
of
the
atlantic
agency
that
he
was
trailing
one
red
lead
jim
a
famous
bank
cracker
who
was
wanted
in
new
york
for
robbery
and
murder
that
he
had
tracked
him
to
west
virginia
and
that
coming
suddenly
upon
william
walson
in
the
road
he
had
believed
him
to
be
the
man
had
arrested
him
and
brought
him
at
once
to
the
town
in
order
to
have
him
extradited
he
said
that
if
walson
was
not
the
man
it
was
the
most
remarkable
case
of
mistaken
identity
on
record
he
then
produced
a
photograph
to
which
was
attached
a
printed
description
the
photograph
was
an
excellent
likeness
of
walson
and
the
description
fitted
him
perfectly
the
coal
dealer
was
dumbfounded
and
joined
with
the
crowd
in
admitting
the
excusableness
of
the
mistake
under
the
very
peculiar
circumstances
but
he
said
that
the
story
might
not
be
true
and
asked
the
sheriff
to
hold
the
detective
in
custody
until
he
was
fully
convinced
that
everything
was
as
hogarth
said
the
detective
declared
himself
perfectly
satisfied
with
this
arrangement
and
william
walson
secured
a
horse
and
hurried
back
to
his
the
perilous
vocation
of
hogarth
had
inured
him
to
tragic
positions
he
was
thoroughly
master
of
his
hand
and
was
playing
it
with
quiet
and
accurate
precision
he
asked
the
sheriff
to
telegraph
the
agency
and
inform
it
of
the
situation
and
said
that
it
would
immediately
establish
the
truth
of
his
statement
that
night
the
mining
town
of
fairmont
was
in
an
uproar
the
streets
were
filled
with
excited
men
loudly
discussing
the
great
misfortune
that
had
so
strangely
befallen
the
manager
of
the
oceanic
coal
company
it
had
happened
that
when
william
walson
returned
to
his
after
his
release
by
the
sheriff
he
found
the
horse
lying
dead
by
the
roadside
and
the
a
heap
of
ashes
and
broken
irons
the
charred
remains
of
the
satchel
were
found
under
the
heap
of
rubbish
but
it
was
impossible
to
determine
whether
the
money
had
been
carried
away
or
destroyed
by
the
fire
a
jug
that
had
lately
contained
liquor
was
found
near
by
all
the
circumstances
indicated
that
the
atrocious
act
was
the
malicious
work
of
some
one
of
the
roving
bands
of
drunken
cutthroats
but
the
wonder
of
it
all
was
the
coincidence
of
the
detective
and
the
glaring
boldness
of
the
fiend
hobos
the
atlantic
agency
of
new
york
answered
the
sheriff
telegram
immediately
confirming
hogarth
statement
and
referring
to
the
district
attorney
of
new
york
and
the
chief
of
police
these
answered
that
the
agency
was
all
right
and
that
its
statement
should
be
accepted
as
correct
finally
as
a
last
precaution
the
sheriff
and
the
president
of
the
oceanic
coal
company
talked
with
the
new
york
police
chief
by
telephone
when
they
were
at
length
assured
that
the
detective
story
was
true
he
was
released
and
asked
to
go
with
the
president
before
the
board
of
directors
here
he
went
fully
over
the
whole
matter
explaining
that
the
man
red
lead
jim
was
a
desperate
character
and
for
that
reason
he
had
been
so
severe
and
careful
not
daring
to
risk
the
drive
back
to
town
in
the
when
asked
his
theory
of
the
robbery
he
said
that
the
first
impression
of
the
people
was
undoubtedly
correct
that
the
country
was
full
of
wandering
gangs
of
desperate
blacklegs
that
the
money
being
in
paper
was
perhaps
destroyed
by
the
fire
and
not
discovered
at
all
by
the
thugs
in
their
malicious
and
drunken
deviltry
the
board
of
directors
were
not
inclined
to
censure
hogarth
suggesting
that
after
all
he
had
perhaps
saved
the
life
of
william
walson
as
it
was
evident
that
the
drunken
hobos
would
have
murdered
him
if
he
had
been
present
when
they
chanced
upon
the
horse
and
nevertheless
the
detective
seemed
utterly
prostrated
over
the
great
loss
that
had
resulted
from
his
unfortunate
mistake
and
left
for
new
york
on
the
first
train
iii
the
following
night
two
men
stepped
from
the
train
at
jersey
city
and
turned
down
towards
the
ferry
for
a
time
they
walked
along
in
silence
suddenly
the
big
one
turned
to
his
companion
parks
he
said
you
are
a
lightning
operator
my
boy
you
should
play
the
mob
in
a
roman
drama
i
fixed
the
evidence
all
right
hogarth
answered
the
other
and
i
have
not
forgotten
the
trust
fund
whereupon
he
winked
at
his
big
companion
and
tapped
on
the
breast
of
his
coat
significantly
the
detective
face
lighted
up
and
then
grew
anxious
well
he
said
lowering
his
voice
are
we
going
to
try
the
other
end
of
it
why
not
answered
the
little
clerk
do
we
need
the
trust
fund
doubled
iv
the
great
gambling
house
of
morehead
opstein
company
was
beginning
to
be
deserted
by
the
crowd
that
had
tempted
the
fickle
goddess
all
night
long
to
their
great
hurt
it
was
now
four
in
the
morning
and
only
one
or
two
of
the
more
desperate
losers
hung
on
to
play
snakey
the
parson
a
thin
delicate
knave
with
a
long
innocent
melancholy
face
was
dealing
faro
for
the
house
snakey
was
a
special
in
the
parlance
of
the
guild
his
luck
was
known
to
come
in
blizzards
if
he
won
to
use
the
manager
language
he
won
out
through
the
ceiling
and
if
he
lost
he
lost
down
to
his
health
for
this
reason
snakey
the
parson
was
not
a
safe
man
as
a
regular
but
he
was
a
golden
bonanza
when
the
cards
went
his
way
and
they
were
going
his
way
the
stragglers
drifted
out
one
by
one
and
the
dealer
was
preparing
to
quit
the
table
when
the
door
opened
and
two
men
entered
one
was
a
little
old
man
with
a
white
beard
and
a
lean
hungry
face
the
other
was
a
big
cattle
drover
the
two
came
up
to
the
table
and
stood
for
a
moment
looking
at
the
a
faint
smile
passed
over
the
face
of
snakey
the
parson
he
knew
the
types
well
they
were
western
with
money
how
high
do
ye
go
mister
said
the
little
man
against
the
sky
answered
the
dealer
sadly
then
i
jist
double
me
pile
said
the
little
old
man
reaching
down
into
his
pocket
and
fishing
up
a
roll
of
bills
wrapped
in
a
dirty
old
newspaper
he
counted
the
money
and
placed
it
upon
the
table
the
dealer
looked
up
in
astonishment
ten
thousand
he
said
yep
answered
the
old
man
an
i
want
ter
bet
hit
on
the
jack
er
spades
the
dealer
pushed
a
stack
of
yellow
chips
across
the
table
no
siree
said
the
player
you
do
give
me
no
buttons
i
ll
put
my
pile
on
this
side
and
you
put
your
pile
on
side
and
the
winner
takes
snakey
the
parson
wavered
a
moment
it
was
against
the
rules
but
here
was
too
good
a
thing
to
lose
he
turned
counted
out
the
money
and
placed
it
on
his
right
and
began
to
deal
from
the
box
the
cards
fell
rapidly
for
a
time
the
blacks
ran
on
the
side
of
the
house
suddenly
they
changed
and
the
queen
and
the
ten
of
spades
fell
on
the
left
the
dealer
saw
the
card
under
his
thumb
and
paused
the
keen
eyes
of
the
old
man
were
fixed
on
him
he
determined
to
take
the
long
chance
knowing
that
the
loss
was
only
temporary
and
the
jack
of
spades
came
up
and
fell
on
the
side
of
the
stranger
with
a
whoop
of
joy
the
old
man
clutched
the
money
i
am
going
to
try
her
agin
he
cried
hold
on
said
the
big
pushing
up
to
the
table
my
wad
is
as
good
as
you
it
is
my
turn
now
the
dealer
grinned
you
can
both
play
gentlemen
he
said
speaking
with
a
low
sweet
accent
no
we
ca
muttered
the
drover
with
the
childish
obstinacy
of
a
man
i
want
the
whole
shooting
match
to
myself
he
can
have
the
next
whirl
at
her
thereupon
the
drover
dragged
a
big
red
pocket
book
from
somewhere
inside
his
coat
took
out
a
thick
straight
package
of
bills
and
laid
it
down
on
the
table
how
much
said
the
dealer
running
his
finger
over
the
end
of
the
package
same
as
abe
said
the
drover
here
said
the
little
old
man
peevishly
if
you
wo
let
me
play
bet
my
roll
with
yourn
and
he
pushed
the
ten
thousand
of
his
own
money
to
his
companion
and
placed
the
money
which
he
had
won
from
the
bank
in
his
pocket
the
drover
took
the
money
and
piled
it
up
on
the
ace
of
spades
the
dealer
face
grew
pensive
and
sweet
it
was
all
right
this
time
he
was
going
to
round
off
the
night
with
a
golden
d
he
opened
the
safe
behind
him
counted
out
twenty
thousand
in
big
bills
and
piled
it
up
on
one
side
of
the
bank
then
he
opened
the
box
and
began
the
old
man
wandered
around
the
room
the
big
hung
over
the
table
snakey
the
parson
scarcely
saw
either
he
was
intent
on
manipulating
the
box
and
his
hand
darted
in
and
out
like
a
white
snake
suddenly
the
ace
of
spades
flew
out
and
fell
on
the
side
of
the
house
the
quick
dealer
clapped
his
left
hand
over
the
box
and
put
out
his
right
for
the
player
money
as
he
did
so
the
big
drover
bent
forward
and
thrust
a
revolver
into
his
face
no
you
do
he
growled
this
is
my
money
and
i
will
not
leave
it
thank
you
snakey
the
parson
glanced
at
the
man
and
knew
that
he
had
been
fooled
but
he
was
composed
and
under
the
box
on
the
right
were
weapons
and
the
electric
button
he
began
to
take
his
right
hand
slowly
from
the
table
stop
said
the
drover
sharply
that
game
wo
work
the
dealer
looked
up
into
the
player
face
and
dropped
his
hands
he
was
a
brave
man
and
desperate
as
gamblers
go
but
he
knew
death
when
he
saw
it
his
face
turned
yellow
and
became
ghastly
but
he
did
not
move
the
drover
took
up
his
money
from
the
and
handed
it
to
the
old
man
he
used
his
left
hand
only
and
did
not
take
his
eyes
from
the
gambler
face
the
old
man
thrust
the
bundle
of
bills
in
his
pocket
and
hurried
from
the
room
the
gambler
sat
rigid
as
a
wax
figure
the
drover
waited
until
his
companion
had
sufficient
time
to
get
thoroughly
away
from
the
house
then
he
began
to
move
slowly
backward
to
the
door
keeping
the
gambler
covered
with
the
weapon
the
faro
dealer
watched
every
move
of
the
drover
like
a
hawk
but
he
did
not
attempt
to
take
his
hand
from
the
table
the
muzzle
of
the
revolver
was
too
rigid
it
was
simply
moving
backward
from
his
face
in
a
dead
straight
line
at
the
door
the
drover
stopped
drew
himself
together
then
sprang
suddenly
through
and
bounded
down
the
stairs
snakey
the
parson
touched
the
electric
button
and
as
the
drover
rushed
into
the
street
two
policemen
caught
him
by
the
shoulder
v
well
said
the
police
chief
i
am
tired
of
making
an
ass
of
myself
mason
says
this
cattle
drover
has
committed
no
crime
except
a
petty
assault
and
if
he
is
right
i
want
to
know
it
that
man
beats
the
very
devil
every
time
i
have
sent
up
a
case
against
his
protest
the
judges
have
pitched
me
out
on
my
neck
and
the
thing
has
got
to
be
cursedly
monotonous
the
district
attorney
smiled
grimly
and
turned
around
in
his
chair
have
you
given
me
all
the
details
he
said
yes
answered
the
official
just
exactly
as
they
occurred
the
district
attorney
arose
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
looked
down
at
the
great
there
was
a
queer
set
to
his
mouth
and
the
merest
shadow
of
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
well
my
friend
he
said
you
are
pitched
out
on
your
neck
again
the
official
drew
a
deep
breath
and
his
face
fell
then
it
is
not
robbery
he
said
no
answered
the
attorney
well
mused
the
police
chief
this
law
business
is
too
high
for
me
i
have
spent
my
life
dealing
with
crimes
and
i
thought
i
knew
one
when
i
saw
it
but
i
give
it
up
i
do
know
the
first
principles
why
here
is
a
fellow
who
voluntarily
goes
into
a
gambling
house
plays
and
loses
then
draws
a
revolver
and
forcibly
takes
away
the
money
which
by
the
rules
of
the
play
belongs
to
the
house
robs
the
dealer
by
threatening
to
kill
him
steals
the
bank
money
and
fights
his
way
out
it
can
not
matter
that
the
man
robbed
was
a
lawbreaker
himself
or
that
the
crime
occurred
in
a
gambling
house
it
is
the
law
of
new
york
that
has
been
violated
the
place
and
parties
are
of
no
importance
here
is
certainly
the
force
and
the
putting
in
fear
that
constitute
the
vital
element
of
robbery
and
yet
you
say
it
is
not
robbery
you
have
me
lost
all
right
my
dear
sir
put
in
the
district
attorney
the
vital
element
of
robbery
is
not
the
force
and
terror
but
is
what
is
called
in
the
books
the
meaning
the
intention
to
steal
the
presence
of
this
felonious
intent
determines
whether
or
not
the
wrong
is
a
crime
if
it
be
not
present
there
can
be
no
robbery
no
matter
how
great
the
force
violence
or
putting
in
fear
or
how
graven
serious
or
irreparable
the
resulting
injury
it
is
true
indeed
that
the
force
and
terror
are
elements
but
the
vital
one
is
the
intent
if
force
and
violence
one
takes
his
own
property
from
the
possession
of
another
it
is
no
robbery
nor
is
it
robbery
for
one
to
take
the
property
of
another
by
violence
under
the
belief
that
it
is
his
own
or
that
he
has
some
right
to
it
or
by
mistake
or
misunderstanding
although
vast
loss
be
caused
thereby
and
great
wrong
and
hurt
result
i
have
no
hope
of
ever
understanding
it
said
the
police
chief
i
am
only
a
common
man
with
a
short
life
time
why
sir
continued
the
attorney
it
is
as
plain
as
sunlight
robbery
is
compounded
of
larceny
and
force
it
is
larceny
from
the
person
by
violence
but
in
order
to
constitute
it
the
property
must
be
taken
from
the
peaceable
possession
of
the
party
and
it
must
be
taken
neither
of
these
happened
in
the
case
you
state
because
the
faro
dealer
by
means
of
an
unlawful
game
could
not
secure
any
color
of
right
or
title
to
the
money
which
he
should
win
by
it
therefore
the
money
taken
was
not
his
property
and
could
not
have
been
taken
from
his
peaceable
possession
in
the
second
place
this
vital
element
of
robbery
the
animus
furandi
is
totally
wanting
for
the
reason
that
the
player
in
forcibly
seizing
the
money
which
he
had
lost
was
actuated
by
no
intention
to
steal
but
on
the
contrary
was
simply
taking
possession
of
his
own
property
property
to
which
he
had
a
full
legal
right
and
title
but
put
in
the
officer
there
was
the
other
ten
thousand
which
the
old
man
won
they
got
away
with
that
if
the
game
was
unlawful
they
had
no
right
to
that
true
said
the
lawyer
the
old
man
had
no
title
to
the
ten
thousand
which
he
had
won
but
he
did
not
steal
it
the
dealer
gave
it
to
him
of
his
own
free
will
and
the
old
man
had
it
in
his
possession
by
the
full
voluntary
consent
of
the
dealer
some
time
before
the
resort
to
violence
there
was
clearly
no
crime
in
this
damn
it
all
said
the
police
chief
wearily
is
there
no
way
to
get
at
him
ca
we
railroad
him
before
a
jury
the
district
attorney
looked
at
the
baffled
officer
and
grinned
ominously
my
friend
he
said
there
is
no
power
in
venice
can
alter
a
decree
established
the
courts
have
time
and
again
passed
upon
cases
exactly
similar
to
this
and
have
held
that
there
was
no
crime
except
perhaps
a
petty
misdemeanor
we
could
not
weather
a
proceeding
on
ten
minutes
we
could
never
get
to
a
jury
when
the
judge
came
to
examine
the
decisions
on
this
question
we
would
go
out
as
you
expressed
it
on
our
necks
well
muttered
the
police
chief
as
he
pulled
on
his
coat
it
is
just
as
randolph
mason
said
out
he
goes
the
attorney
laughed
and
turned
to
his
desk
the
officer
crossed
to
the
door
jerked
it
open
then
stopped
and
faced
round
district
attorney
he
said
wo
there
be
hell
to
pay
when
the
crooks
learn
the
law
then
he
stalked
through
and
banged
the
door
after
him
the
district
attorney
looked
out
of
the
window
and
across
the
street
at
the
dirty
row
of
ugly
buildings
humph
he
said
there
is
something
in
that
last
remark
of
the
chief
vi
braxton
hogarth
detective
member
of
the
atlantic
agency
in
good
standing
now
by
right
of
law
and
by
virtue
of
his
craft
restored
to
his
freedom
and
identity
stepped
back
and
was
swallowed
up
by
the
crowd
the
great
ocean
liner
steamed
out
from
the
port
of
new
york
on
its
pathless
journey
to
the
sunny
south
of
france
randolph
mason
sat
in
an
invalid
chair
close
up
to
the
rail
of
the
deck
he
was
grim
emaciated
and
rigidly
ugly
his
body
was
exhausted
worn
out
utterly
long
ago
but
the
fierce
mysterious
spirit
of
the
man
was
tireless
and
wrought
on
unceasingly
for
a
time
he
was
silent
his
eyes
wide
and
his
jaw
set
like
a
wolf
trap
suddenly
he
clutched
the
rail
and
staggered
to
his
feet
parks
he
muttered
parks
this
ship
is
worth
a
million
dollars
come
with
me
to
the
cabin
and
i
will
show
you
how
it
may
be
wrested
from
the
owners
and
no
crime
committed
do
you
understand
me
parks
no
crime
for
the
purpose
of
a
complete
demonstration
two
situations
are
here
combined
in
the
first
the
crime
of
robbery
was
committed
but
in
such
a
manner
as
to
completely
evade
an
inference
of
the
although
it
was
in
fact
present
and
obtained
in
the
second
there
was
no
robbery
the
being
entirely
absent
although
it
apparently
existed
in
a
conspicuous
the
end
