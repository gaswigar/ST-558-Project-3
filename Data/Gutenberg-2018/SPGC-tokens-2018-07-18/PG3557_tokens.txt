one
of
the
circumstances
which
foretold
the
brief
duration
of
the
peace
of
amiens
was
that
pitt
was
out
of
office
at
the
time
of
its
conclusion
i
mentioned
this
to
bonaparte
and
i
immediately
perceived
by
his
hasty
what
do
you
say
that
my
observation
had
been
heard
but
not
liked
it
did
not
however
require
any
extraordinary
shrewdness
to
see
the
true
motive
of
pitt
retirement
that
distinguished
statesman
conceived
that
a
truce
under
the
name
of
a
peace
was
indispensable
for
england
but
intending
to
resume
the
war
with
france
more
fiercely
than
ever
he
for
a
while
retired
from
office
and
left
to
others
the
task
of
arranging
the
peace
but
his
intention
was
to
mark
his
return
to
the
ministry
by
the
renewal
of
the
implacable
hatred
he
had
vowed
against
france
still
i
have
always
thought
that
the
conclusion
of
peace
however
necessary
to
england
was
an
error
of
the
cabinet
of
london
england
alone
had
never
before
acknowledged
any
of
the
governments
which
had
risen
up
in
france
since
the
revolution
and
as
the
past
could
not
be
blotted
out
a
future
war
however
successful
to
england
could
not
take
from
bonaparte
government
the
immense
weight
it
had
acquired
by
an
interval
of
peace
besides
by
the
mere
fact
of
the
conclusion
of
the
treaty
england
proved
to
all
europe
that
the
restoration
of
the
bourbons
was
merely
a
pretext
and
she
defaced
that
page
of
her
history
which
might
have
shown
that
she
was
actuated
by
nobler
and
more
generous
sentiments
than
mere
hatred
of
france
it
is
very
certain
that
the
condescension
of
england
in
treating
with
the
first
consul
had
the
effect
of
rallying
round
him
a
great
many
partisans
of
the
bourbons
whose
hopes
entirely
depended
on
the
continuance
of
war
between
great
britain
and
france
this
opened
the
eyes
of
the
greater
number
namely
those
who
could
not
see
below
the
surface
and
were
not
previously
aware
that
the
demonstrations
of
friendship
so
liberally
made
to
the
bourbons
by
the
european
cabinets
and
especially
by
england
were
merely
false
pretences
assumed
for
the
purpose
of
disguising
beneath
the
semblance
of
honourable
motives
their
wish
to
injure
france
and
to
oppose
her
rapidly
increasing
power
when
the
misunderstanding
took
place
france
and
england
might
have
mutually
reproached
each
other
but
justice
was
apparently
on
the
side
of
france
it
was
evident
that
england
by
refusing
to
evacuate
malta
was
guilty
of
a
palpable
infraction
of
the
treaty
of
amiens
while
england
could
only
institute
against
france
what
in
the
french
law
language
is
called
a
suit
or
process
of
tendency
but
it
must
be
confessed
that
this
tendency
on
the
part
of
france
to
augment
her
territory
was
very
evident
for
the
consular
decrees
made
conquests
more
promptly
than
the
sword
the
union
of
piedmont
with
france
had
changed
the
state
of
europe
this
union
it
is
true
was
effected
previously
to
the
treaty
of
amiens
but
it
was
not
so
with
the
states
of
parma
and
piacenza
bonaparte
having
by
his
sole
authority
constituted
himself
the
heir
of
the
grand
duke
recently
deceased
it
may
therefore
be
easily
imagined
how
great
was
england
uneasiness
at
the
internal
prosperity
of
france
and
the
insatiable
ambition
of
her
ruler
but
it
is
no
less
certain
that
with
respect
to
malta
england
acted
with
decidedly
bad
faith
and
this
bad
faith
appeared
in
its
worst
light
from
the
following
circumstance
it
had
been
stipulated
that
england
should
withdraw
her
troops
from
malta
three
months
after
the
signing
of
the
treaty
yet
more
than
a
year
had
elapsed
and
the
troops
were
still
there
the
order
of
malta
was
to
be
restored
as
it
formerly
was
that
is
to
say
it
was
to
be
a
sovereign
and
independent
order
under
the
protection
of
the
holy
see
the
three
cabinets
of
vienna
berlin
and
petersburg
were
to
guarantee
the
execution
of
the
treaty
of
amiens
the
english
ambassador
to
excuse
the
evasions
of
his
government
pretended
that
the
russian
cabinet
concurred
with
england
in
the
delayed
fulfilment
of
the
conditions
of
the
treaty
but
at
the
very
moment
he
was
making
that
excuse
a
courier
arrived
from
the
cabinet
of
petersburg
bearing
despatches
completely
at
variance
with
the
assertion
of
lord
whitworth
his
lordship
left
paris
on
the
night
of
the
may
and
the
english
government
unsolicited
sent
passports
to
the
french
embassy
in
london
the
news
of
this
sudden
rupture
made
the
english
console
fall
four
per
but
did
not
immediately
produce
such
a
retrograde
effect
on
the
french
funds
which
were
then
quoted
at
francs
a
very
high
point
when
it
is
recollected
that
they
were
at
seven
or
eight
francs
on
the
eve
of
the
brumaire
in
this
state
of
things
france
proposed
to
the
english
government
to
admit
of
the
mediation
of
russia
but
as
england
had
declared
war
in
order
to
repair
the
error
she
committed
in
concluding
peace
the
proposition
was
of
course
rejected
thus
the
public
gave
the
first
consul
credit
for
great
moderation
and
a
sincere
wish
for
peace
thus
arose
between
england
and
france
a
contest
resembling
those
furious
wars
which
marked
the
reigns
of
king
john
and
charles
vii
our
beaux
esprits
drew
splendid
comparisons
between
the
existing
state
of
things
and
the
ancient
rivalry
of
carthage
and
rome
and
sapiently
concluded
that
as
carthage
fell
england
must
do
so
likewise
bonaparte
was
at
st
cloud
when
lord
whitworth
left
paris
a
fortnight
was
spent
in
useless
attempts
to
renew
negotiations
war
therefore
was
the
only
alternative
before
he
made
his
final
preparations
the
first
consul
addressed
a
message
to
the
senate
the
legislative
body
and
the
tribunate
in
this
message
he
mentioned
the
recall
of
the
english
ambassador
the
breaking
out
of
hostilities
the
unexpected
message
of
the
king
of
england
to
his
parliament
and
the
armaments
which
immediately
ensued
in
the
british
ports
in
vain
he
said
had
france
tried
every
means
to
induce
england
to
abide
by
the
treaty
she
had
repelled
every
overture
and
increased
the
insolence
of
her
demands
france
he
added
will
not
submit
to
menaces
but
will
combat
for
the
faith
of
treaties
and
the
honour
of
the
french
name
confidently
trusting
that
the
result
of
the
contest
will
be
such
as
she
has
a
right
to
expect
from
the
justice
of
her
cause
and
the
courage
of
her
people
this
message
was
dignified
and
free
from
that
vein
of
boasting
in
which
bonaparte
so
frequently
indulged
the
reply
of
the
senate
was
accompanied
by
a
vote
of
a
ship
of
the
line
to
be
paid
for
out
of
the
senatorial
salaries
with
his
usual
address
bonaparte
in
acting
for
himself
spoke
in
the
name
of
the
people
just
as
he
did
in
the
question
of
the
consulate
for
life
but
what
he
then
did
for
his
own
interests
turned
to
the
future
interests
of
the
bourbons
the
very
treaty
which
had
just
been
broken
off
gave
rise
to
a
curious
observation
bonaparte
though
not
yet
a
sovereign
peremptorily
required
the
king
of
england
to
renounce
the
empty
title
of
king
of
france
which
was
kept
up
as
if
to
imply
that
old
pretensions
were
not
yet
renounced
the
proposition
was
acceded
to
and
to
this
circumstance
was
owing
the
disappearance
of
the
title
of
king
of
france
from
among
the
titles
of
the
king
of
england
when
the
treaty
of
paris
was
concluded
on
the
return
of
the
bourbons
the
first
grievance
complained
of
by
england
was
the
prohibition
of
english
merchandise
which
had
been
more
rigid
since
the
peace
than
during
the
war
the
avowal
of
great
britain
on
this
point
might
well
have
enabled
her
to
dispense
with
any
other
subject
of
complaint
for
the
truth
is
she
was
alarmed
at
the
aspect
of
our
internal
prosperity
and
at
the
impulse
given
to
our
manufactures
the
english
government
had
hoped
to
obtain
from
the
first
consul
such
a
commercial
treaty
as
would
have
proved
a
to
our
rising
trade
but
bonaparte
opposed
this
and
from
the
very
circumstance
of
his
refusal
he
might
easily
have
foreseen
the
rupture
at
which
he
affected
to
be
surprised
what
i
state
i
felt
at
the
time
when
i
read
with
great
interest
all
the
documents
relative
to
this
great
dispute
between
the
two
rival
nations
which
eleven
years
afterwards
was
decided
before
the
walls
of
paris
it
was
evidently
disappointment
in
regard
to
a
commercial
treaty
which
created
the
animosity
of
the
english
government
as
that
circumstance
was
alluded
to
by
way
of
reproach
in
the
king
of
england
declaration
in
that
document
it
was
complained
that
france
had
sent
a
number
of
persona
into
the
ports
of
great
britain
and
ireland
in
the
character
of
commercial
agents
which
character
and
the
privileges
belonging
to
it
they
could
only
have
acquired
by
a
commercial
treaty
such
was
in
my
opinion
the
real
cause
of
the
complaints
of
england
but
as
it
would
have
seemed
too
absurd
to
make
it
the
ground
of
a
declaration
of
war
she
enumerated
other
grievances
the
union
of
piedmont
and
of
the
states
of
parma
and
piacenza
with
france
and
the
continuance
of
the
french
troops
in
holland
a
great
deal
was
said
about
the
views
and
projects
of
france
with
respect
to
turkey
and
this
complaint
originated
in
general
sebastiani
mission
to
egypt
on
that
point
i
can
take
upon
me
to
say
that
the
english
government
was
not
misinformed
bonaparte
too
frequently
spoke
to
are
of
his
ideas
respecting
the
east
and
his
project
of
attacking
the
english
power
in
india
to
leave
any
doubt
of
his
ever
having
renounced
them
the
result
of
all
the
reproaches
which
the
two
governments
addressed
to
each
other
was
that
neither
acted
with
good
faith
the
first
consul
in
a
communication
to
the
legislative
body
on
the
state
of
france
and
on
her
foreign
relations
had
said
england
handed
can
not
cope
with
france
this
sufficed
to
irritate
the
susceptibility
of
english
pride
and
the
british
cabinet
affected
to
regard
it
as
a
threat
however
it
was
no
such
thing
when
bonaparte
threatened
his
words
were
infinitely
more
energetic
the
passage
above
cited
was
merely
au
assurance
to
france
and
if
we
only
look
at
the
past
efforts
and
sacrifices
made
by
england
to
stir
up
enemies
to
france
on
the
continent
we
may
be
justified
in
supposing
that
her
anger
at
bonaparte
declaration
arose
from
a
conviction
of
its
truth
singly
opposed
to
france
england
could
doubtless
have
done
her
much
harm
especially
by
assailing
the
scattered
remnants
of
her
navy
but
she
could
have
done
nothing
against
france
on
the
continent
the
two
powers
unaided
by
allies
might
have
continued
long
at
war
without
any
considerable
acts
of
hostility
the
first
effect
of
the
declaration
of
war
by
england
was
the
invasion
of
hanover
by
the
french
troops
under
general
mortier
the
telegraphic
despatch
by
which
this
news
was
communicated
to
paris
was
as
laconic
as
correct
and
contained
in
a
few
words
the
complete
history
of
the
expedition
it
ran
as
follows
the
french
are
masters
of
the
electorate
of
hanover
and
the
enemy
army
are
made
prisoners
of
war
a
day
or
two
after
the
shop
windows
of
the
were
filled
with
caricatures
on
the
english
and
particularly
on
the
duke
of
cambridge
i
recollect
seeing
one
in
which
the
duke
was
represented
reviewing
his
troops
mounted
on
a
crab
i
mention
these
trifles
because
as
i
was
then
living
entirely
at
leisure
in
the
rue
hauteville
i
used
frequently
to
take
a
stroll
on
the
boulevards
where
i
was
sometimes
much
amused
with
these
prints
and
i
could
not
help
remarking
that
in
large
cities
such
triffles
have
more
influence
on
the
public
mind
than
is
usually
supposed
the
first
consul
thought
the
taking
of
the
prisoners
in
hanover
a
good
opportunity
to
exchange
them
for
those
taken
from
us
by
the
english
navy
a
proposition
to
this
effect
was
accordingly
made
but
the
english
cabinet
was
of
opinion
that
though
the
king
of
england
was
also
elector
of
hanover
yet
there
was
no
identity
between
the
two
governments
of
both
which
george
iii
was
the
head
in
consequence
of
this
subtle
distinction
the
proposition
for
the
exchange
of
prisoners
fell
to
the
ground
at
this
period
nothing
could
exceed
the
animosity
of
the
two
governments
towards
each
other
and
bonaparte
on
the
declaration
of
war
marked
his
indignation
by
an
act
which
no
consideration
can
justify
i
allude
to
the
order
for
the
arrest
of
all
the
english
in
france
a
truly
barbarious
measure
for
can
anything
be
more
cruel
and
unjust
than
to
visit
individuals
with
the
vengeance
due
to
the
government
whose
subjects
they
may
happen
to
be
but
bonaparte
when
under
the
influence
of
auger
was
never
troubled
by
scruples
i
must
here
notice
the
fulfilment
of
a
remark
bonaparte
often
made
use
of
to
me
during
the
consulate
you
shall
see
bourrienne
he
would
say
what
use
i
will
make
of
the
priests
war
being
declared
the
first
consul
in
imitation
of
the
most
christian
kings
of
olden
times
recommended
the
success
of
his
arms
to
the
prayers
of
the
faithful
through
the
medium
of
the
clergy
to
this
end
he
addressed
a
circular
letter
written
in
royal
style
to
the
cardinals
archbishops
and
bishops
of
france
it
was
as
follows
monsieur
the
motives
of
the
present
war
are
known
throughout
europe
the
bad
faith
of
the
king
of
england
who
has
violated
his
treaties
by
refusing
to
restore
malta
to
the
order
of
john
of
jerusalem
and
attacked
our
merchant
vessels
without
a
previous
declaration
of
war
together
with
the
necessity
of
a
just
defence
forced
us
to
have
recourse
to
arms
i
therefore
wish
you
to
order
prayers
to
be
offered
up
in
order
to
obtain
the
benediction
of
heaven
on
our
enterprises
the
proofs
i
have
received
of
your
zeal
for
the
public
service
give
me
an
assurance
of
your
readiness
to
conform
with
my
wishes
given
at
st
cloud
prairial
an
xi
june
signed
bonaparte
this
letter
was
remarkable
in
more
than
one
respect
it
astonished
most
of
his
old
who
turned
it
into
ridicule
observing
that
bonaparte
needed
no
praying
to
enable
him
to
conquer
italy
twice
over
the
first
consul
however
let
them
laugh
on
and
steadily
followed
the
line
he
had
traced
out
his
letter
was
admirably
calculated
to
please
the
court
of
rome
which
he
wished
should
consider
him
in
the
light
of
another
elder
son
of
the
church
the
letter
was
moreover
remarkable
for
the
use
of
the
word
monsieur
which
the
first
consul
now
employed
for
the
first
time
in
an
act
destined
for
publicity
this
circumstance
would
seem
to
indicate
that
he
considered
republican
designations
incompatible
with
the
forms
due
to
the
clergy
the
clergy
were
especially
interested
in
the
restoration
of
monarchy
it
may
perhaps
be
thought
that
i
dwell
too
much
on
trifles
but
i
lived
long
enough
in
confidence
to
know
the
importance
he
attached
to
trifles
the

restored
the
old
names
of
the
days
of
the
week
while
he
allowed
the
names
of
the
months
as
set
down
in
the
republican
calendar
to
remain
he
commenced
by
ordering
the
moniteur
to
be
dated
saturday

a
day
of

said
he
one
day
was
there
ever
such
an
inconsistency
we
shall
be
laughed
at
but
i
will
do
away
with
the
messidor
i
will
efface
all
the
inventions
of
the
jacobins
the
clergy
did
not
disappoint
the
expectations
of
the
first
consul
they
owed
him
much
already
and
hoped
for
still
more
from
him
the
letter
to
the
bishops
was
the
signal
for
a
number
of
circulars
full
of
eulogies
on
bonaparte
these
compliments
were
far
from
displeasing
to
the
first
consul
who
had
no
objection
to
flattery
though
he
despised
those
who
meanly
made
themselves
the
medium
of
conveying
it
to
him
duroc
once
told
me
that
they
had
all
great
difficulty
in
preserving
their
gravity
when
the
cure
of
a
parish
in
abbeville
addressed
bonaparte
one
day
while
he
was
on
his
journey
to
the
coast
religion
said
the
worthy
cure
with
pompous
solemnity
owes
to
you
all
that
it
is
we
owe
to
you
all
that
we
are
and
i
too
owe
to
you
all
that
i
am
not
so
fulsome

some
of
the
terms
used
a
year
later

napoleon

it

bonaparte
says
joseph

had
himself

in

by

was

by

caprara
about
the
end
of

bonaparte
proceeded
with
josephine
on
his
journey
to
belgium
and
the
seaboard
departments
many
curious
circumstances
were
connected
with
this
journey
of
which
i
was
informed
by
duroc
after
the
first
consul
return
bonaparte
left
paris
on
the
of
june
and
although
it
was
not
for
upwards
of
a
year
afterwards
that
his
brow
was
encircled
with
the
everything
connected
with
the
journey
had
an
imperial
air
it
was
formerly
the
custom
when
the
kings
of
france
entered
the
ancient
capital
of
picardy
for
the
town
of
amiens
to
offer
them
in
homage
some
beautiful
swans
care
was
taken
to
revive
this
custom
which
pleased
bonaparte
greatly
because
it
was
treating
him
like
a
king
the
swans
were
accepted
and
sent
to
paris
to
be
placed
in
the
basin
of
the
tuileries
in
order
to
show
the
parisians
the
royal
homage
which
the
first
consul
received
when
absent
from
the
capital
it
was
also
during
this
journey
that
bonaparte
began
to
date
his
decrees
from
the
places
through
which
he
passed
he
had
hitherto
left
a
great
number
of
signatures
in
paris
in
order
that
he
might
be
present
as
it
were
even
during
his
absence
by
the
acts
of
his
government
hitherto
public
acts
had
been
signed
in
the
name
of
the
consuls
of
the
republic
instead
of
this
formula
he
substituted
the
name
of
the
government
of
the
republic
by
means
of
this
variation
unimportant
as
it
might
appear
the
government
was
always
in
the
place
where
the
first
consul
happened
to
be
the
two
other
consuls
were
now
mere
nullities
even
in
appearance
the
decrees
of
the
government
which
cambaceres
signed
during
the
campaign
of
marengo
were
now
issued
from
all
the
towns
of
france
and
belgium
which
the
first
consul
visited
during
his
six
weeks
journey
having
thus
centred
the
sole
authority
of
the
republic
in
himself
the
performers
of
the
theatre
of
the
republic
became
by
a
natural
consequence
his
and
it
was
quite
natural
that
they
should
travel
in
his
suite
to
entertain
the
inhabitants
of
the
towns
in
which
he
stopped
by
their
performances
but
this
was
not
all
he
encouraged
the
renewal
of
a
host
of
ancient
customs
he
sanctioned
the
revival
of
the
festival
of
joan
of
arc
at
orleans
and
he
divided
the
institute
into
four
classes
with
the
intention
of
recalling
the
recollection
of
the
old
academies
the
names
of
which
however
he
rejected
in
spite
of
the
wishes
and
intrigues
of
suard
and
the
abby
morellet
who
had
gained
over
lucien
upon
this
point
however
the
first
consul
did
not
give
to
the
classes
of
the
institute
the
rank
which
they
formerly
possessed
as
academies
he
placed
the
class
of
sciences
in
the
first
rank
and
the
old
french
academy
in
the
second
rank
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
considering
the
state
of
literature
and
science
at
that
period
the
first
consul
did
not
make
a
wrong
estimate
of
their
importance
although
the
literature
of
france
could
boast
of
many
men
of
great
talent
such
as
la
harpe
who
died
during
the
consulate
ducis
bernardin
de
chenier
and
lemercier
yet
they
could
not
be
compared
with
lagrange
laplace
monge
fourcroy
berthollet
and
cuvier
whose
labours
have
so
prodigiously
extended
the
limits
of
human
knowledge
no
one
therefore
could
murmur
at
seeing
the
class
of
sciences
in
the
institute
take
precedence
of
its
elder
sister
besides
the
first
consul
was
not
sorry
to
show
by
this
arrangement
the
slight
estimation
in
which
he
held
literary
men
when
he
spoke
to
me
respecting
them
he
called
them
mere
manufacturers
of
phrases
he
could
not
pardon
them
for
excelling
him
in
a
pursuit
in
which
he
had
no
claim
to
distinction
i
never
knew
a
man
more
insensible
than
bonaparte
to
the
beauties
of
poetry
or
prose
a
certain
degree
of
vagueness
which
was
combined
with
his
energy
of
mind
led
him
to
admire
the
dreams
of
ossian
and
his
decided
character
found
itself
as
it
were
represented
in
the
elevated
thoughts
of
corneille
hence
his
almost
exclusive
predilection
for
these
two
authors
with
this
exception
the
finest
works
in
our
literature
were
in
his
opinion
merely
arrangements
of
sonorous
words
void
of
sense
and
calculated
only
for
the
ear
bonaparte
contempt
or
more
properly
speaking
his
dislike
of
literature
displayed
itself
particularly
in
the
feeling
he
cherished
towards
some
men
of
distinguished
literary
talent
he
hated
chenier
and
ducis
still
more
he
could
not
forgive
chenier
for
the
republican
principles
which
pervaded
his
tragedies
and
ducis
excited
in
him
as
if
instinctively
an
involuntary
hatred
ducis
on
his
part
was
not
backward
in
returning
the
consul
animosity
and
i
remember
his
writing
some
verses
which
were
inexcusably
violent
and
overstepped
all
the
bounds
of
truth
bonaparte
was
so
singular
a
composition
of
good
and
bad
that
to
describe
him
as
he
was
under
one
or
other
of
these
aspects
would
serve
for
panegyric
or
satire
without
any
departure
from
truth
bonaparte
was
very
fond
of
bernardin
romance
of
and
virginia
which
he
had
read
in
his
boyhood
i
remember
that
he
one
day
tried
to
read
etudes
de
la
nature
but
at
the
expiration
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
threw
down
the
book
exclaiming
how
can
any
one
read
such
silly
stuffy
it
is
insipid
and
vapid
there
is
nothing
in
it
these
are
the
dreams
of
a
visionary
what
is
nature
the
thing
is
vague
and
unmeaning
men
and
passions
are
the
subjects
to
write
about
there
is
something
there
for
study
these
fellows
are
good
for
nothing
under
any
government
i
will
however
give
them
pensions
because
i
ought
to
do
so
as
head
of
the
state
they
occupy
and
amuse
the
idle
i
will
make
lagrange
a
senator
he
has
a
head
although
bonaparte
spoke
so
disdainfully
of
literary
men
it
must
not
be
taken
for
granted
that
he
treated
them
on
the
contrary
all
those
who
visited
at
malmaison
were
the
objects
of
his
attention
and
even
flattery
lemercier
was
one
of
those
who
came
most
frequently
and
whom
bonaparte
received
with
the
greatest
pleasure
bonaparte
treated
lemercier
with
great
kindness
but
he
did
not
like
him
his
character
as
a
literary
man
and
poet
joined
to
a
polished
frankness
and
a
mild
but
inflexible
spirit
of
republicanism
amply
sufficed
to
explain
bonaparte
dislike
he
feared
lemercier
and
his
pen
and
as
happened
more
than
once
he
played
the
part
of
a
parasite
by
flattering
the
writer
lemercier
was
the
only
man
i
knew
who
refused
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honour
bonaparte
general
dislike
of
literary
men
was
less
the
result
of
prejudice
than
circumstances
in
order
to
appreciate
or
even
to
read
literary
works
time
is
requsite
and
time
was
so
precious
to
him
that
he
would
have
wished
as
one
may
say
to
shorten
a
straight
line
he
liked
only
those
writers
who
directed
their
attention
to
positive
and
precise
things
which
excluded
all
thoughts
of
government
and
censures
on
administration
he
looked
with
a
jealous
eye
on
political
economists
and
lawyers
in
short
as
all
persons
who
in
any
way
whatever
meddled
with
legislation
and
moral
improvements
his
hatred
of
discussions
on
those
subjects
was
strongly
displayed
on
the
occasion
of
the
classification
of
the
institute
whilst
he
permitted
the
reassembling
of
a
literary
class
to
the
number
of
forty
as
formerly
he
suppressed
the
class
of
moral
and
political
science
such
was
his
predilection
for
things
of
immediate
and
certain
utility
that
even
in
the
sciences
he
favoured
only
such
as
applied
to
terrestrial
objects
he
never
treated
lalande
with
so
much
distinction
as
monge
and
lagrange
astronomical
discoveries
could
not
add
directly
to
his
own
greatness
and
besides
he
could
never
forgive
lalande
for
having
wished
to
include
him
in
a
dictionary
of
atheists
precisely
at
the
moment
when
he
was
opening
negotiations
with
the
court
of
rome
bonaparte
wished
to
be
the
sole
centre
of
a
world
which
he
believed
he
was
called
to
govern
with
this
view
he
never
relaxed
in
his
constant
endeavour
to
concentrate
the
whole
powers
of
the
state
in
the
hands
of
its
chief
his
conduct
upon
the
subject
of
the
revival
of
public
instruction
affords
evidence
of
this
fact
he
wished
to
establish
bursaries
to
be
paid
by
government
and
to
be
exclusively
at
his
disposal
so
that
thus
possessing
the
monopoly
of
education
he
could
have
parcelled
it
out
only
to
the
children
of
those
who
were
blindly
devoted
to
him
this
was
what
the
first
consul
called
the
revival
of
public
instruction
during
the
period
of
my
closest
intimacy
with
him
he
often
spoke
to
me
on
this
subject
and
listened
patiently
to
my
observations
i
remember
that
one
of
his
chief
arguments
was
this
what
is
it
that
distinguishes
men
education
is
it
not
well
if
the
children
of
nobles
be
admitted
into
the
academies
they
will
be
as
well
educated
as
the
children
of
the
revolution
who
compose
the
strength
of
my
government
ultimately
they
will
enter
into
my
regiments
as
officers
and
will
naturally
come
in
competition
with
those
whom
they
regard
as
the
plunderers
of
their
families
i
do
not
wish
that
my
recollections
have
caused
me
to
wander
from
the
journey
of
the
first
consul
and
madame
bonaparte
to
the
seabord
departments
and
belgium
i
have
however
little
to
add
to
what
i
have
already
stated
on
the
subject
i
merely
remember
that
bonaparte
military
suite
and
lauriston
and
rapp
in
particular
when
speaking
to
me
about
the
journey
could
not
conceal
some
marks
of
discontent
on
account
of
the
great
respect
which
bonaparte
had
shown
the
clergy
and
particularly
to
de
roquelaure
the
archbishop
of
malines
or
mechlin
that
prelate
who
was
a
shrewd
man
and
had
the
reputation
of
having
been
in
his
youth
more
addicted
to
the
habits
of
the
world
than
to
those
of
the
cloister
had
become
an
ecclesiastical
courtier
he
went
to
antwerp
to
pay
his
homage
to
the
first
consul
upon
whom
he
heaped
the
most
extravagant
praises
afterwards
addressing
madame
bonaparte
he
told
her
that
she
was
united
to
the
first
consul
by
the
sacred
bonds
of
a
holy
alliance
in
this
harangue
in
which
unction
was
singularly
blended
with
gallantry
surely
it
was
a
departure
from
ecclesiastical
propriety
to
speak
of
sacred
bonds
and
holy
alliance
when
every
one
knew
that
those
bonds
and
that
alliance
existed
only
by
a
civil
contract
perhaps
de
roquelaure
merely
had
recourse
to
what
casuists
call
a
pious
fraud
in
order
to
engage
the
married
couple
to
do
that
which
he
congratulated
them
on
having
already
done
be
this
as
it
may
it
is
certain
that
this
honeyed
language
gained
de
roquelaure
the
consul
favour

prison

all
the
intrigues
of
europe
were
in
motion
emissaries
came
daily
from
england
who
if
they
could
not
penetrate
into
the
interior
of
france
remained
in
the
towns
near
the
frontiers
where
they
established
correspondence
and
published
pamphlets
which
they
sent
to
paris
by
post
in
the
form
of
letters
the
first
consul
on
the
other
hand
gave
way
without
reserve
to
the
natural
irritation
which
that
power
had
excited
by
her
declaration
of
war
he
knew
that
the
most
effective
war
he
could
carry
on
against
england
would
be
a
war
against
her
trade
as
a
prelude
to
that
piece
of
madness
known
by
the
name
of
the
continental
system
the
first
consul
adopted
every
possible
preventive
measure
against
the
introduction
of
english
merchandise
irritation
against
the
english
was
not
without
a
cause
the
intelligence
which
reached
paris
from
the
north
of
france
was
not
very
consolatory
the
english
fleets
not
only
blockaded
the
french
ports
but
were
acting
on
the
offensive
and
had
bombarded
granville
the
mayor
of
the
town
did
his
duty
but
his
colleagues
more
prudent
acted
differently
in
the
height
of
his
displeasure
bonaparte
issued
a
decree
by
which
he
bestowed
a
scarf
of
honour
on
letourneur
the
mayor
and
dismissed
his
colleagues
from
office
as
cowards
unworthy
of
trust
the
terms
of
this
decree
were
rather
severe
but
they
were
certainly
justified
by
the
conduct
of
those
who
had
abandoned
their
posts
at
s
critical
moment
i
come
now
to
the
subject
of
the
invasion
of
england
and
what
the
first
consul
said
to
me
respecting
it
i
have
stated
that
bonaparte
never
had
any
idea
of
realising
the
pretended
project
of
a
descent
on
england
the
truth
of
this
assertion
will
appear
from
a
conversation
which
i
had
with
him
after
he
returned
from
his
journey
to
the
north
in
this
conversation
he
repeated
what
he
had
often
before
mentioned
to
me
in
reference
to
the
projects
and
possible
steps
to
which
fortune
might
compel
him
to
resort
the
peace
of
amiens
had
been
broken
about
seven
months
when
on
the
of
december
the
first
consul
sent
for
me
to
the
tuileries
his
incomprehensible
behaviour
to
me
was
fresh
in
my
mind
and
as
it
was
upwards
of
a
year
since
i
had
seen
him
i
confess
i
did
not
feel
quite
at
ease
when
i
received
the
summons
he
was
perfectly
aware
that
i
possessed
documents
and
data
for
writing
his
history
which
would
describe
facts
correctly
and
destroy
the
illusions
with
which
his
flatterers
constantly
entertained
the
public
i
have
already
stated
that
at
that
period
i
had
no
intention
of
the
kind
but
those
who
laboured
constantly
to
incense
him
against
me
might
have
suggested
apprehensions
on
the
subject
at
all
events
the
fact
is
that
when
he
sent
for
me
i
took
the
precaution
of
providing
myself
with
a
conceiving
it
to
be
very
likely
that
i
should
be
sent
to
sleep
at
vincennes
on
the
day
appointed
for
the
interview
rapp
was
on
duty
i
did
not
conceal
from
him
my
opinion
as
to
the
possible
result
of
my
visit
you
need
not
be
afraid
said
rapp
the
first
consul
merely
wishes
to
talk
with
you
he
then
announced
me
bonaparte
came
into
the
grand
salon
where
i
awaited
him
and
addressing
me
in
the
most
way
said
what
do
the
gossips
say
of
my
preparations
for
the
invasion
of
england
there
is
a
great
difference
of
opinion
on
the
subject
general
i
replied
everyone
speaks
according
to
his
own
views
suchet
for
instance
who
comes
to
see
me
very
often
has
no
doubt
that
it
will
take
place
and
hopes
to
give
you
on
the
occasion
fresh
proofs
of
his
gratitude
and
fidelity
but
suchet
tells
me
that
you
do
not
believe
it
will
be
attempted
that
is
true
i
certainly
do
why
because
you
told
me
at
antwerp
five
years
ago
that
you
would
not
risk
france
on
the
cast
of
a
die
that
the
adventure
was
too
hazardous
and
circumstances
have
not
altered
since
that
time
you
are
right
those
who
look
forward
to
the
invasion
of
england
are
blockheads
they
do
not
see
the
affair
in
its
true
light
i
can
doubtless
land
in
england
with
men
a
great
battle
will
be
fought
which
i
shall
gain
but
i
must
reckon
upon
men
killed
wounded
and
prisoners
if
i
march
on
london
a
second
battle
must
be
fought
i
will
suppose
myself
again
victorious
but
what
should
i
do
in
london
with
an
army
diminished
and
without
the
hope
of
reinforcements
it
would
be
madness
until
our
navy
acquires
superiority
it
is
useless
to
think
of
such
a
project
the
great
assemblage
of
troops
in
the
north
has
another
object
my
government
must
be
the
first
in
the
world
or
it
must
fall
bonaparte
then
evidently
wished
it
to
be
supposed
that
he
entertained
the
design
of
invading
england
in
order
to
divert
the
attention
of
europe
to
that
direction
from
dunkirk
the
first
consul
proceeded
to
antwerp
where
also
he
had
assembled
experienced
men
to
ascertain
their
opinions
respecting
the
surest
way
of
attempting
a
landing
the
project
of
which
was
merely
a
pretence
the
employment
of
large
ships
of
was
after
rang
discussions
abandoned
in
favour
of
a
flotilla
at
this
period
a
caricature
by
gillray
appeared
in
london
which
was
sent
to
paris
and
strictly
sought
after
by
the
police
one
of
the
copies
was
shown
to
the
first
consul
who
was
highly
indignant
at
it
the
french
fleet
was
represented
by
a
number
of
an
english
sailor
seated
on
a
rock
was
quietly
smoking
his
pipe
the
whiffs
of
which
were
throwing
the
whole
squadron
into
bourrienne
gillray
caricatures
should
be
at
the
reader
side
during
the
perusal
of
this
work
also
english
caricature
and
satire
on
napoleon
by
ashton
chatto
and

after
visiting
belgium
and
giving
directions
there
the
first
consul
returned
from
brussels
to
paris
by
way
of
maestricht
liege
and
soissons
before
my
visit
to
the
tuileries
and
even
before
the
rupture
of
the
peace
of
amiens
certain
intriguing
speculators
whose
extravagant
zeal
was
not
less
fatal
to
the
cause
of
the
bourbons
than
was
the
blind
subserviency
of
his
unprincipled
adherents
to
the
first
consul
had
taken
part
in
some
underhand
manoeuvres
which
could
have
no
favourable
result
amongst
these
great
contrivers
of
petty
machinations
the
fauche
borel
the
bookseller
of
neufchatel
had
long
been
conspicuous
fauche
borel
whose
object
was
to
create
a
stir
and
who
wished
nothing
better
than
to
be
noticed
and
paid
failed
not
to
come
to
france
as
soon
as
the
peace
of
amiens
afforded
him
the
opportunity
i
was
at
that
time
still
with
bonaparte
who
was
aware
of
all
these
little
plots
but
who
felt
no
personal
anxiety
on
the
subject
leaving
to
his
police
the
care
of
watching
their
authors
the
object
of
fauche
borel
mission
was
to
bring
about
a
reconciliation
between
moreau
and
pichegru
the
latter
general
who
was
banished
on
the
fructidor
september
had
not
obtained
the
first
permission
to
return
to
france
he
lived
in
england
where
he
awaited
a
favourable
opportunity
for
putting
his
old
projects
into
execution
moreau
was
in
pains
but
no
longer
appeared
at
the
levees
or
parties
of
the
first
consul
and
the
enmity
of
both
generals
against
bonaparte
openly
avowed
on
the
part
of
pichegru
and
still
disguised
by
moreau
was
a
secret
to
nobody
but
as
everything
was
prosperous
with
bonaparte
he
evinced
contempt
rather
than
fear
of
the
two
generals
his
apprehensions
were
indeed
tolerably
allayed
by
the
absence
of
the
one
and
the
character
of
the
other
moreau
name
had
greater
weight
with
the
army
than
that
of
pichegru
and
those
who
were
plotting
the
overthrow
of
the
consular
government
knew
that
that
measure
could
not
be
attempted
with
any
chance
of
success
without
the
assistance
of
moreau
the
moment
was
inopportune
but
being
initiated
in
some
secrets
of
the
british
cabinet
they
knew
that
the
peace
was
but
a
truce
and
they
determined
to
profit
by
that
truce
to
effect
a
reconciliation
which
might
afterwards
secure
a
community
of
interests
moreau
and
pichegru
had
not
been
friends
since
moreau
sent
to
the
directory
the
papers
seized
in
de
carriage
which
placed
pichegru
treason
in
so
clear
a
light
since
that
period
pichegru
name
possessed
no
influence
over
the
minds
of
the
soldiers
amongst
whom
he
had
very
few
partisans
whilst
the
name
of
moreau
was
dear
to
all
who
had
conquered
under
his
command
fauche
borel
design
was
to
compromise
moreau
without
bringing
him
to
any
decisive
step
moreau
natural
indolence
and
perhaps
it
may
be
said
his
good
sense
induced
him
to
adopt
the
maxim
that
it
was
necessary
to
let
men
and
things
take
their
course
for
temporizing
policy
is
often
as
useful
in
politics
as
in
war
besides
moreau
was
a
sincere
republican
and
if
his
habit
of
indecision
had
permitted
him
to
adopt
any
resolution
it
is
quite
certain
that
he
would
not
then
have
assisted
in
the
reestablishment
of
the
bourbons
as
pichegru
wished
what
i
have
stated
is
an
indispensable
introduction
to
the
knowledge
of
plots
of
more
importance
which
preceded
the
great
event
that
marked
the
close
of
the
consulship
i
allude
to
the
conspiracy
of
georges
cadoudal
moreau
and
pichegru
and
that
indelible
stain
on
the
character
of
napoleon
the
death
of
the
duc
different
opinions
have
been
expressed
concerning
georges
conspiracy
i
shall
not
contradict
any
of
them
i
will
relate
what
i
learned
and
what
i
saw
in
order
to
throw
some
light
on
that
horrible
affair
i
am
far
from
believing
what
i
have
read
in
many
works
that
it
was
planned
by
the
police
in
order
to
pave
the
first
consul
way
to
the
throne
i
think
that
it
was
contrived
by
those
who
were
really
interested
in
it
and
encouraged
by
fouche
in
order
to
prepare
his
return
to
office
to
corroborate
my
opinion
respecting
fouche
conduct
and
his
manoeuvres
i
must
remind
the
reader
that
about
the
close
of
some
persons
conceived
the
project
of
reconciling
moreau
and
pichegru
fouche
who
was
then
out
of
the
ministry
caused
moreau
to
be
visited
by
men
of
his
own
party
and
who
were
induced
perhaps
unconsciously
by
fouche
art
to
influence
and
irritate
the
general
mind
it
was
at
first
intended
that
the
abbe
david
the
mutual
friend
of
moreau
and
pichegru
should
undertake
to
effect
their
reconciliation
but
he
being
arrested
and
confined
in
the
temple
was
succeeded
by
a
man
named
lajolais
whom
every
circumstance
proves
to
have
been
employed
by
fouche
he
proceeded
to
london
and
having
prevailed
on
pichegru
and
his
friends
to
return
to
france
he
set
off
to
announce
their
arrival
and
arrange
everything
for
their
reception
and
destruction
moreau
discontent
was
the
sole
foundation
of
this
intrigue
i
remember
that
one
day
about
the
end
of
january
i
called
on
fouche
who
informed
me
that
he
had
been
at
st
cloud
where
he
had
had
a
long
conversation
with
the
first
consul
on
the
situation
of
affairs
bonaparte
told
him
that
he
was
satisfied
with
the
existing
police
and
hinted
that
it
was
only
to
make
himself
of
consequence
that
he
had
given
a
false
colouring
to
the
picture
fouche
asked
him
what
he
would
say
if
he
told
him
that
georges
and
pichegru
had
been
for
some
time
in
paris
carrying
on
the
conspiracy
of
which
he
had
received
information
the
first
consul
apparently
delighted
at
what
he
conceived
to
be
fouche
mistake
said
with
an
air
of
contempt
you
are
well
informed
truly
regnier
has
just
received
a
letter
from
london
stating
that
pichegru
dined
three
days
ago
at
kingston
with
one
of
the
king
of
england
ministers
as
fouche
however
persisted
in
his
assertion
the
first
consul
sent
to
paris
for
the
grand
judge
regnier
who
showed
fouche
the
letter
he
had
received
the
first
consul
triumphed
at
first
to
see
fouche
at
fault
but
the
latter
so
clearly
proved
that
georges
and
pichegru
were
actually
in
paris
that
regnier
began
to
fear
he
had
been
misled
by
his
agents
whom
his
rival
paid
better
than
he
did
the
first
consul
convinced
that
his
old
minister
knew
more
than
his
new
one
dismissed
regnier
and
remained
a
long
time
in
consultation
with
fouche
who
on
that
occasion
said
nothing
about
his
reinstatement
for
fear
of
exciting
suspicion
he
only
requested
that
the
management
of
the
business
might
be
entrusted
to
real
with
orders
to
obey
whatever
instructions
he
might
receive
from
him
i
will
return
hereafter
to
the
arrest
of
moreau
and
the
other
persons
accused
and
will
now
subjoin
the
account
of
a
long
interview
which
i
had
with
bonaparte
in
the
midst
of
these
important
events
on
the
of
march
some
time
after
the
arrest
but
before
the
trial
of
general
moreau
i
had
an
audience
of
the
first
consul
which
was
unsought
on
my
part
bonaparte
after
putting
several
unimportant
questions
to
me
as
to
what
i
was
doing
what
i
expected
he
should
do
for
me
and
assuring
me
that
he
would
bear
me
in
mind
gave
a
sudden
turn
to
the
conversation
and
said
by
the
by
the
report
of
my
connection
with
hortense
is
still
kept
up
the
most
abominable
rumours
have
been
spread
as
to
her
first
child
i
thought
at
the
time
that
these
reports
had
only
been
admitted
by
the
public
in
consequence
of
the
great
desire
that
i
should
not
be
childless
since
you
and
i
separated
have
you
heard
them
repeated
yes
general
oftentimes
and
i
confess
i
could
not
have
believed
that
this
calumny
would
have
existed
so
long
it
is
truly
frightful
to
think
of
you
know
the
truth
you
have
seen
all
heard
all
nothing
could
have
passed
without
your
knowledge
you
were
in
her
full
confidence
during
the
time
of
her
attachment
to
duroc
i
therefore
expect
if
you
should
ever
write
anything
about
me
that
you
will
clear
me
from
this
infamous
imputation
i
would
not
have
it
accompany
my
name
to
posterity
i
trust
in
you
you
have
never
given
credit
to
the
horrid
accusation
no
general
never
napoleon
then
entered
into
a
number
of
details
on
the
previous
life
of
hortense
on
the
way
in
which
she
conducted
herself
and
on
the
turn
which
her
marriage
had
taken
it
has
not
turned
out
he
said
as
i
wished
the
union
has
not
been
a
happy
one
i
am
sorry
for
it
not
only
because
both
are
dear
to
me
but
because
the
circumstance
countenances
the
infamous
reports
that
are
current
among
the
idle
as
to
my
intimacy
with
her
he
concluded
the
conversation
with
these
words
bourrienne
i
sometimes
think
of
recalling
you
but
as
there
is
no
good
pretext
for
so
doing
the
world
would
say
that
i
have
need
of
you
and
i
wish
it
to
be
known
that
i
stand
in
need
of
nobody
he
again
said
a
few
words
about
hortense
i
answered
that
it
would
fully
coincide
with
my
conviction
of
the
truth
to
do
what
he
desired
and
that
i
would
do
it
but
that
suppressing
the
false
reports
did
not
depend
on
me
hortense
in
fact
while
she
was
mademoiselle
beauharnais
regarded
napoleon
with
respectful
awe
she
trembled
when
she
spoke
to
him
and
never
dared
to
ask
him
a
favour
when
she
had
anything
to
solicit
she
applied
to
me
and
if
i
experienced
any
difficulty
in
obtaining
for
her
what
she
sought
i
mentioned
her
as
the
person
for
whom
i
pleaded
the
little
simpleton
napoleon
would
say
why
does
she
not
ask
me
herself
is
the
girl
afraid
of
me
napoleon
never
cherished
for
her
any
feeling
but
paternal
tenderness
he
loved
her
after
his
marriage
with
her
mother
as
he
would
have
loved
his
own
child
during
three
years
i
was
a
witness
to
all
their
most
private
actions
and
i
declare
that
i
never
saw
or
heard
anything
that
could
furnish
the
least
ground
for
suspicion
or
that
afforded
the
slightest
trace
of
the
existence
of
a
culpable
intimacy
this
calumny
must
be
classed
among
those
with
which
malice
delights
to
blacken
the
characters
of
men
more
brilliant
than
their
fellows
and
which
are
so
readily
adopted
by
the
and
unreflecting
i
freely
declare
that
did
i
entertain
the
smallest
doubt
with
regard
to
this
odious
charge
of
the
existence
of
which
i
was
well
aware
before
napoleon
spoke
to
me
on
the
subject
i
would
candidly
avow
it
he
is
no
more
and
let
his
memory
be
accompanied
only
by
that
be
it
good
or
bad
which
really
belongs
to
it
let
not
this
reproach
be
one
of
those
charged
against
him
by
the
impartial
historian
i
must
say
in
concluding
this
delicate
subject
that
the
principles
of
napoleon
on
points
of
this
kind
were
rigid
in
the
utmost
degree
and
that
a
connection
of
the
nature
of
that
charged
against
him
was
neither
in
accordance
with
his
morals
nor
his
tastes
i
can
not
tell
whether
what
followed
was
a
portion
of
his
premeditated
conversation
with
me
or
whether
it
was
the
result
of
the
satisfaction
he
had
derived
from
ascertaining
my
perfect
conviction
of
the
purity
of
his
conduct
with
regard
to
hortense
and
being
assured
that
i
would
express
that
conviction
be
this
as
it
may
as
i
was
going
out
at
the
door
he
called
me
back
saying
oh
i
have
forgotten
something
i
returned
bourrienne
said
he
do
you
still
keep
up
your
acquaintance
with
the
fauchers
yes
general
i
see
them
frequently
you
are
wrong
why
should
i
not
they
are
clever
men
and
exceedingly
pleasant
company
especially
caesar
i
derive
great
pleasure
from
their
society
and
then
they
are
almost
the
only
persons
whose
friendship
has
continued
faithful
to
me
since
i
left
you
you
know
people
do
not
care
for
those
who
can
render
them
no
service
maret
will
not
see
the
fauchers
that
may
be
general
but
it
is
nothing
to
me
and
you
must
recollect
that
as
it
was
through
him
i
was
introduced
to
them
at
the
tuileries
i
think
he
ought
to
inform
me
of
his
reasons
for
dropping
their
acquaintance
i
tell
you
again
he
has
closed
his
door
against
them
do
you
the
same
i
advise
you
as
i
did
not
seem
disposed
to
follow
this
advice
without
some
plausible
reason
the
first
consul
added
you
must
know
then
that
i
learn
from
caesar
all
that
passes
in
your
house
you
do
not
speak
very
ill
of
me
yourself
nor
does
any
one
venture
to
do
so
in
your
presence
you
play
your
rubber
and
go
to
bed
but
no
sooner
are
you
gone
than
your
wife
who
never
liked
me
and
most
of
those
who
visit
at
your
house
indulge
in
the
most
violent
attacks
upon
me
i
receive
a
bulletin
from
caesar
faucher
every
day
when
he
visits
at
your
house
this
is
the
way
in
which
he
requites
you
for
your
kindness
and
for
the
asylum
you
afforded
his
constantine
rancher
had
been
condemned
in
contumacy
for
the
forgery
of
a
public
bourrienne
but
enough
you
see
i
know
all
farewell
and
he
left
me
the
grave
having
closed
over
these
two
brothers
the
fauchers
were
twin
brothers
distinguished
in
the
war
of
the
revolution
and
made
generals
at
the
same
time
on
the
field
of
battle
after
the
cent
jours
they
refused
to
recognise
the
bourbons
and
were
shot
by
sentence
of
at
bordeaux
bouillet
i
shall
merely
state
that
they
wrote
me
a
letter
the
evening
preceding
their
execution
in
which
they
begged
me
to
forgive
their
conduct
towards
me
the
following
is
an
extract
from
this
letter
in
our
dungeon
we
hear
our
sentence
of
death
being
cried
in
the
streets
we
shall
walk
to
the
scaffold
but
we
will
meet
death
with
such
calmness
and
courage
as
shall
make
our
executioners
blush
we
are
sixty
years
old
therefore
our
lives
will
only
be
shortened
by
a
brief
apace
during
our
lives
we
have
shared
in
common
illness
grief
pleasure
danger
and
good
fortune
we
both
entered
the
world
on
the
same
day
and
on
the
same
day
we
shall
both
depart
from
it
as
to
you
sir
i
suppress
what
relates
to
myself
the
hour
of
the
grand
levee
arrived
just
as
the
singular
interview
which
i
have
described
terminated
i
remained
a
short
time
to
look
at
this
phantasmagoria
duroc
was
there
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
he
came
up
and
taking
me
into
the
recess
of
a
window
told
me
that
moreau
guilt
was
evident
and
that
he
was
about
to
be
put
on
his
trial
i
made
some
observations
on
the
subject
and
in
particular
asked
whether
there
were
sufficient
proofs
of
his
guilt
to
justify
his
condemnation
they
should
be
cautious
said
i
it
is
no
joke
to
accuse
the
conqueror
of
hohenlinden
duroc
answer
satisfied
me
that
he
at
least
had
no
doubt
on
the
subject
besides
added
he
when
such
a
general
as
moreau
has
been
between
two
gendarmes
he
is
lost
and
is
good
for
nothing
more
he
will
only
inspire
pity
in
vain
i
tried
to
refute
this
assertion
so
entirely
contrary
to
facts
and
to
convince
duroc
that
moreau
would
never
be
damaged
by
calling
him
brigand
as
was
the
phrase
then
without
proofs
duroc
persisted
in
his
opinion
as
if
a
political
crime
ever
sullied
the
honour
of
any
one
the
result
has
proved
that
i
judged
rightly
no
person
possessing
the
least
degree
of
intelligence
will
be
convinced
that
the
conspiracy
of
moreau
georges
pichegru
and
the
other
persons
accused
would
ever
have
occurred
but
for
the
secret
connivance
of
fouche
police
moreau
never
for
a
moment
desired
the
restoration
of
the
bourbons
i
was
too
well
acquainted
with
carbonnet
his
most
intimate
friend
to
be
ignorant
of
his
private
sentiments
it
was
therefore
quite
impossible
that
he
could
entertain
the
same
views
as
georges
the
polignacs
riviera
and
others
and
they
had
no
intention
of
committing
any
overt
acts
these
latter
persons
had
come
to
the
continent
solely
to
investigate
the
actual
state
of
affairs
in
order
to
inform
the
princes
of
the
house
of
bourbon
with
certainty
how
far
they
might
depend
on
the
foolish
hopes
constantly
held
out
to
them
by
paltry
agents
who
were
always
ready
to
advance
their
own
interests
at
the
expense
of
truth
these
agents
did
indeed
conspire
but
it
was
against
the
treasury
of
london
to
which
they
looked
for
pay
without
entering
into
all
the
details
of
that
great
trial
i
will
relate
some
facts
which
may
assist
in
eliciting
the
truth
from
a
chaos
of
intrigue
and
falsehood
most
of
the
conspirators
had
been
lodged
either
in
the
temple
or
la
force
and
one
of
them
bouvet
de
lozier
who
was
confined
in
the
temple
attempted
to
hang
himself
he
made
use
of
his
cravat
to
effect
his
purpose
and
had
nearly
succeeded
when
a
turnkey
by
chance
entered
and
found
him
at
the
point
of
death
when
he
was
recovered
he
acknowledged
that
though
he
had
the
courage
to
meet
death
he
was
unable
to
endure
the
interrogatories
of
his
trial
and
that
he
had
determined
to
kill
himself
lest
he
might
be
induced
to
make
a
confession
he
did
in
fact
confess
and
it
was
on
the
day
after
this
occurred
that
moreau
was
arrested
while
on
his
way
from
his
of
grosbois
to
paris
fouche
through
the
medium
of
his
agents
had
given
pichegru
georges
and
some
other
partisans
of
royalty
to
understand
that
they
might
depend
on
moreau
who
it
was
said
was
quite
prepared
it
is
certain
that
moreau
informed
pichegru
that
he
pichegru
had
been
deceived
and
that
he
had
never
been
spoken
to
on
the
subject
russillon
declared
on
the
trial
that
on
the
of
march
the
polignacs
said
to
some
one
everything
is
going
wrong
they
do
not
understand
each
other
moreau
does
not
keep
his
word
we
have
been
deceived
de
riviera
declared
that
he
soon
became
convinced
they
had
been
deceived
and
was
about
to
return
to
england
when
he
was
arrested
it
is
certain
that
the
principal
conspirators
obtained
positive
information
which
confirmed
their
suspicions
they
learned
moreau
declaration
from
pichegru
many
of
the
accused
declared
that
they
soon
discovered
they
had
been
deceived
and
the
greater
part
of
them
were
about
to
quit
paris
when
they
were
all
arrested
almost
at
one
and
the
same
moment
georges
was
going
into
la
vendee
when
he
was
betrayed
by
the
man
who
with
the
connivance
of
the
police
had
escorted
him
ever
since
his
departure
from
london
and
who
had
protected
him
from
any
interruption
on
the
part
of
the
police
so
long
as
it
was
only
necessary
to
know
where
he
was
or
what
he
was
about
georges
had
been
in
paris
seven
months
before
it
was
considered
that
the
proper
moment
had
arrived
for
arresting
him
the
almost
simultaneous
arrest
of
the
conspirators
proves
clearly
that
the
police
knew
perfectly
well
where
they
could
lay
their
hands
upon
them
when
pichegru
was
required
to
sign
his
examination
he
refused
he
said
it
was
unnecessary
that
knowing
all
the
secret
machinery
of
the
police
he
suspected
that
by
some
chemical
process
they
would
erase
all
the
writing
except
the
signature
and
afterwards
fill
up
the
paper
with
statements
which
he
had
never
made
his
refusal
to
sign
the
interrogatory
he
added
would
not
prevent
him
from
repeating
before
a
court
of
justice
the
truth
which
he
had
stated
in
answer
to
the
questions
proposed
to
him
fear
was
entertained
of
the
disclosures
he
might
make
respecting
his
connection
with
moreau
whose
destruction
was
sought
for
and
also
with
respect
to
the
means
employed
by
the
agents
of
fouche
to
urge
the
conspirators
to
effect
a
change
which
they
desired
on
the
evening
of
the
of
february
i
heard
of
moreau
arrest
and
early
next
morning
i
proceeded
straight
to
the
rue
pierre
where
carbonnet
resided
with
his
nephew
i
was
anxious
to
hear
from
him
the
particulars
of
the
general
arrest
what
was
my
surprise
i
had
hardly
time
to
address
myself
to
the
porter
before
he
informed
me
that
carbonnet
and
his
nephew
were
both
arrested
i
advise
you
sir
added
the
man
to
retire
without
more
ado
for
i
can
assure
you
that
the
persons
who
visit
carbonnet
are
watched
is
he
still
at
home
said
i
yes
sir
they
are
examining
his
papers
then
said
i
i
will
go
up
carbonnet
of
whose
friendship
i
had
reason
to
be
proud
and
whose
memory
will
ever
be
dear
to
me
was
more
distressed
by
the
arrest
of
his
nephew
and
moreau
than
by
his
own
his
nephew
was
however
liberated
after
a
few
hours
carbonnet
papers
were
sealed
up
and
he
was
placed
in
solitary
confinement
at
pelagic
thus
the
police
who
previously
knew
nothing
were
suddenly
informed
of
all
in
spite
of
the
numerous
police
agents
scattered
over
france
it
was
only
discovered
by
the
declarations
of
bouvet
de
lozier
that
three
successive
landings
had
been
effected
and
that
a
fourth
was
expected
which
however
did
not
take
place
because
general
savary
was
despatched
by
the
first
consul
with
orders
to
seize
the
persons
whose
arrival
was
looked
for
there
can
not
be
a
more
convincing
proof
of
the
fidelity
of
the
agents
of
the
police
to
their
old
chief
and
their
combined
determination
of
trifling

their

in
order
to
form
a
just
idea
of
the
events
which
succeeded
each
other
so
rapidly
at
the
commencement
of
it
is
necessary
to
consider
them
both
separately
and
connectedly
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
all
bonaparte
machinations
tended
to
one
object
the
foundation
of
the
french
empire
in
his
favour
and
it
is
also
essential
to
consider
how
the
situation
of
the
emigrants
in
reference
to
the
first
consul
had
changed
since
the
declaration
of
war
as
long
as
bonaparte
continued
at
peace
the
cause
of
the
bourbons
had
no
support
in
foreign
cabinets
and
the
emigrants
had
no
alternative
but
to
yield
to
circumstances
but
on
the
breaking
out
of
a
new
war
all
was
changed
the
cause
of
the
bourbons
became
that
of
the
powers
at
war
with
france
and
as
many
causes
concurred
to
unite
the
emigrants
abroad
with
those
who
had
returned
but
half
satisfied
there
was
reason
to
fear
something
from
their
revolt
in
combination
with
the
powers
arrayed
against
bonaparte
such
was
the
state
of
things
with
regard
to
the
emigrants
when
the
leaders
and
accomplices
of
georges
conspiracy
were
arrested
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
assassination
of
the
due
louis
antoine
henri
de
bourbon
duc
son
of
the
duc
de
bourbon
and
grandson
of
the
prince
de
conde
served
against
france
in
the
army
of
conde
when
this
force
was
disbanded
he
stayed
at
ettenheim
on
account
of
a
love
affair
with
the
princesse
charlotte
de
arrested
in
the
territory
of
baden
he
was
taken
to
vincennes
and
after
trial
by
martial
shot
is
the
moat
may
with
him
practically
ended
the
house
of
as
his
grandfather
died
in
leaving
only
the
duc
de
bourbon
and
the
princesee
louise
adelaide
abbesse
de
remiremont
who
died
in
took
place
on
the
of
march
on
the
of
april
appeared
the
proposition
of
the
tribunate
to
found
a
government
in
france
under
the
authority
of
one
individual
on
the
of
may
came
the
consulte
naming
napoleon
bonaparte
emperor
and
lastly
on
the
of
june
the
sentence
of
condemnation
on
georges
and
his
accomplices
thus
the
shedding
of
the
blood
of
a
bourbon
and
the
placing
of
the
crown
of
france
on
the
head
of
a
soldier
of
fortune
were
two
acts
interpolated
in
the
sanguinary
drama
of
georges
conspiracy
it
must
be
remembered
too
that
during
the
period
of
these
events
we
were
at
war
with
england
and
on
the
point
of
seeing
austria
and
the
colossus
of
the
north
form
a
coalition
against
the
new
emperor
i
will
now
state
all
i
know
relative
to
the
death
of
the
due
that
unfortunate
prince
who
was
at
ettenheim
in
consequence
of
a
love
affair
had
no
communication
whatever
with
those
who
were
concocting
a
plot
in
the
interior
machiavelli
says
that
when
the
author
of
a
crime
can
not
be
discovered
we
should
seek
for
those
to
whose
advantage
it
turns
in
the
present
case
machiavelli
advice
will
find
an
easy
application
since
the
duke
death
could
be
advantageous
only
to
bonaparte
who
considered
it
indispensable
to
his
accession
to
the
crown
of
france
the
motives
may
be
explained
but
can
they
be
justified
how
could
it
ever
be
said
that
the
due
perished
as
a
presumed
accomplice
in
the
conspiracy
of
georges
moreau
was
arrested
on
the
of
february
at
which
time
the
existence
of
the
conspiracy
was
known
pichegru
and
georges
were
also
arrested
in
february
and
the
due
not
till
the
of
march
now
if
the
prince
had
really
been
concerned
in
the
plot
if
even
he
had
a
knowledge
of
it
would
he
have
remained
at
ettenheim
for
nearly
a
month
after
the
arrest
of
his
presumed
accomplices
intelligence
of
which
he
might
have
obtained
in
the
space
of
three
days
certainly
not
so
ignorant
was
he
of
that
conspiracy
that
when
informed
at
ettenheim
of
the
affair
he
doubted
it
declaring
that
if
it
were
true
his
father
and
grandfather
would
have
made
him
acquainted
with
it
would
so
long
an
interval
have
been
suffered
to
elapse
before
he
was
arrested
alas
cruel
experience
has
shown
that
that
step
would
have
been
taken
in
a
few
hours
the
sentence
of
death
against
georges
and
his
accomplices
was
not
pronounced
till
the
of
june
and
the
due
was
shot
on
the
of
march
before
the
trials
were
even
commenced
how
is
this
precipitation
to
be
explained
if
as
napoleon
has
declared
the
young
bourbon
was
an
accomplice
in
the
crime
why
was
he
not
arrested
at
the
time
the
others
were
why
was
he
not
tried
along
with
them
on
the
ground
of
his
being
an
actual
accomplice
or
of
being
compromised
by
communications
with
them
or
in
short
because
his
answers
might
have
thrown
light
on
that
mysterious
affair
how
was
it
that
the
name
of
the
illustrious
accused
was
not
once
mentioned
in
the
course
of
that
awful
trial
it
can
scarcely
be
conceived
that
napoleon
could
say
at
helena
either
they
contrived
to
implicate
the
unfortunate
prince
in
their
project
and
so
pronounced
his
doom
or
by
omitting
to
inform
him
of
what
was
going
on
allowed
him
imprudently
to
slumber
on
the
brink
of
a
precipice
for
he
was
only
a
stone
cast
from
the
frontier
when
they
were
about
to
strike
the
great
blow
in
the
name
and
for
the
interest
of
his
family
this
reasoning
is
not
merely
absurd
it
is
atrocious
if
the
duke
was
implicated
by
the
confession
of
his
accomplices
he
should
have
been
arrested
and
tried
along
with
them
justice
required
this
if
he
was
not
so
implicated
where
is
the
proof
of
his
guilt
because
some
individuals
without
his
knowledge
plotted
to
commit
a
crime
in
the
name
of
his
family
he
was
to
be
shot
because
he
was
leagues
from
the
scene
of
the
plot
and
had
no
connection
with
it
he
was
to
die
such
arguments
can
not
fail
to
inspire
horror
it
is
absolutely
impossible
any
reasonable
person
can
regard
the
due
as
an
accomplice
of
cadoudal
and
napoleon
basely
imposed
on
his
contemporaries
and
posterity
by
inventing
such
falsehoods
and
investing
them
with
the
authority
of
his
name
had
i
been
then
in
the
first
consul
intimacy
i
may
aver
with
as
much
confidence
as
pride
that
the
blood
of
the
due
would
not
have
imprinted
an
indelible
stain
on
the
glory
of
bonaparte
in
this
terrible
matter
i
could
have
done
what
no
one
but
me
could
even
attempt
and
this
on
account
of
my
position
which
no
one
else
has
since
held
with
bonaparte
i
quite
admit
that
he
would
have
preferred
others
to
me
and
that
he
would
have
had
more
friendship
for
them
than
for
me
supposing
friendship
to
be
compatible
with
the
character
of
bonaparte
but
i
knew
him
better
than
any
one
else
besides
among
those
who
surrounded
him
i
alone
could
have
permitted
myself
some
return
to
our
former
familiarity
on
account
of
our
intimacy
of
childhood
certainly
in
a
matter
which
permanently
touched
the
glory
of
bonaparte
i
should
not
have
been
restrained
by
the
fear
of
some
transitory
fit
of
anger
and
the
reader
has
seen
that
i
did
not
dread
disgrace
why
should
i
have
dreaded
it
i
had
neither
portfolio
nor
office
nor
salary
for
as
i
have
said
i
was
only
with
bonaparte
as
a
friend
and
we
had
as
it
were
a
common
purse
i
feel
a
conviction
that
it
would
have
been
very
possible
for
me
to
have
dissuaded
bonaparte
from
his
fatal
design
inasmuch
as
i
positively
know
that
his
object
after
the
termination
of
the
peace
was
merely
to
frighten
the
emigrants
in
order
to
drive
them
from
ettenheim
where
great
numbers
like
the
due
had
sought
refuge
his
anger
was
particularly
directed
against
a
baroness
de
reith
and
a
baroness
who
had
loudly
vituperated
him
and
distributed
numerous
libels
on
the
left
bank
of
the
rhine
at
that
period
bonaparte
had
as
little
design
against
the
due
life
as
against
that
of
any
other
emigrant
he
was
more
inclined
to
frighten
than
to
harm
him
and
certainly
his
first
intention
was
not
to
arrest
the
prince
but
as
i
have
said
to
frighten
the
and
to
drive
them
to
a
distance
i
must
however
admit
that
when
bonaparte
spoke
to
rapp
and
duroc
of
the
emigrants
on
the
other
side
of
the
rhine
he
expressed
himself
with
much
irritability
so
much
so
indeed
that
de
talleyrand
dreading
its
effects
for
the
due
warned
that
prince
through
the
medium
of
a
lady
to
whom
he
was
attached
of
his
danger
and
advised
him
to
proceed
to
a
greater
distance
from
the
frontier
on
receiving
this
notice
the
prince
resolved
to
rejoin
his
grandfather
which
he
could
not
do
but
by
passing
through
the
austrian
territory
should
any
doubt
exist
as
to
these
facts
it
may
be
added
that
sir
charles
stuart
wrote
to
de
cobentzel
to
solicit
a
passport
for
the
duc
and
it
was
solely
owing
to
the
delay
of
the
austrian
cabinet
that
time
was
afforded
for
the
first
consul
to
order
the
arrest
of
the
unfortunate
prince
as
soon
as
he
had
formed
the
horrible
resolution
of
shedding
the
blood
of
a
bourbon
this
resolution
could
have
originated
only
with
himself
for
who
would
have
dared
to
suggest
it
to
him
the
fact
is
bonaparte
knew
not
what
he
did
his
fever
of
ambition
amounted
to
delirium
and
he
knew
not
how
he
was
losing
himself
in
public
opinion
because
he
did
not
know
that
opinion
to
gain
which
he
would
have
made
every
sacrifice
when
cambaceres
who
with
a
slight
reservation
had
voted
the
death
of
louis
xvi
warmly
opposed
in
the
council
the
duc
arrest
the
first
consul
observed
to
him
methinks
sir
you
have
grown
very
chary
of
bourbon
blood
meanwhile
the
due
was
at
ettenheim
indulging
in
hope
rather
than
plotting
conspiracies
it
is
well
known
that
an
individual
made
an
offer
to
the
prince
de
conde
to
assassinate
the
first
consul
but
the
prince
indignantly
rejected
the
proposition
and
nobly
refused
to
recover
the
rights
of
the
bourbons
at
the
price
of
such
a
crime
the
individual
was
afterwards
discovered
to
be
an
agent
of
the
paris
police
who
had
been
commissioned
to
draw
the
princes
into
a
plot
which
would
have
ruined
them
for
public
feeling
revolts
at
assassination
under
any
circumstances
it
has
been
alleged
that
louis
xviii
refusal
to
treat
with
bonaparte
led
to
the
fatal
catastrophe
of
the
due
death
the
first
correspondence
between
louis
xviii
and
the
first
consul
which
has
been
given
in
these
memoirs
clearly
proves
the
contrary
it
is
certainly
probable
that
louis
xviii
refusal
to
renounce
his
rights
should
have
irritated
bonaparte
but
it
was
rather
late
to
take
his
revenge
two
years
after
and
that
too
on
a
prince
totally
ignorant
of
those
overtures
it
is
needless
to
comment
on
such
absurdities
it
is
equally
unnecessary
to
speak
of
the
mysterious
being
who
often
appeared
at
meetings
in
the
faubourg
germain
and
who
was
afterwards
discovered
to
be
pichegru
a
further
light
is
thrown
on
this
melancholy
catastrophe
by
a
conversation
napoleon
had
a
few
days
after
his
elevation
to
the
imperial
throne
with
masaias
the
french
minister
at
the
court
of
the
grand
duke
of
baden
this
conversation
took
place
at
after
some
remarks
on
the
intrigues
of
the
emigrants
bonaparte
observed
you
ought
at
least
to
have
prevented
the
plots
which
the
due
was
hatching
at
ettenheim
sire
i
am
too
old
to
learn
to
tell
a
falsehood
believe
me
on
this
subject
your
majesty
ear
has
been
abused
do
you
not
think
then
that
had
the
conspiracy
of
georges
and
pichegru
proved
successful
the
prince
would
have
passed
the
rhine
and
have
come
post
to
paris
massias
from
whom
i
had
these
particulars
added
at
this
last
question
of
the
emperor
i
hung
down
my
head
and
was
silent
for
i
saw
he
did
not
wish
to
hear
the
truth
now
let
us
consider
with
that
attention
which
the
importance
of
the
subject
demands
what
has
been
said
by
the
historians
of
helena
napoleon
said
to
his
companions
in
exile
that
the
due
death
must
be
attributed
either
to
an
excess
of
zeal
for
him
napoleon
to
private
views
or
to
mysterious
intrigues
he
had
been
blindly
urged
on
he
was
if
he
might
say
so
taken
by
surprise
the
measure
was
precipitated
and
the
result
predetermined
this
he
might
have
said
but
if
he
did
so
express
himself
how
are
we
to
reconcile
such
a
declaration
with
the
statement
of
how
give
credit
to
assertions
so
very
opposite
napoleon
said
to
de
las
casas
one
day
when
alone
i
recollect
it
well
i
was
taking
my
coffee
half
seated
on
the
table
at
which
i
had
just
dined
when
suddenly
information
was
brought
to
me
that
a
new
conspiracy
had
been
discovered
i
was
warmly
urged
to
put
an
end
to
these
enormities
they
represented
to
me
that
it
was
time
at
last
to
give
a
lesson
to
those
who
had
been
day
after
day
conspiring
against
my
life
that
this
end
could
only
be
attained
by
shedding
the
blood
of
one
of
them
and
that
the
due
who
might
now
be
convicted
of
forming
part
of
this
new
conspiracy
and
taken
in
the
very
act
should
be
that
one
it
was
added
that
he
had
been
seen
at
strasburg
that
it
was
even
believed
that
he
had
been
in
paris
and
that
the
plan
was
that
he
should
enter
france
by
the
east
at
the
moment
of
the
explosion
whilst
the
due
de
berri
was
disembarking
in
the
west
i
should
tell
you
observed
the
emperor
that
i
did
not
even
know
precisely
who
the
due
was
the
revolution
having
taken
place
when
i
was
yet
a
very
young
man
and
i
having
never
been
at
court
and
that
i
was
quite
in
the
dark
as
to
where
he
was
at
that
moment
having
been
informed
on
those
points
i
exclaimed
that
if
such
were
the
case
the
duke
ought
to
be
arrested
and
that
orders
should
be
given
to
that
effect
everything
had
been
foreseen
and
prepared
the
different
orders
were
already
drawn
up
nothing
remained
to
be
done
but
to
sign
them
and
the
fate
of
the
young
prince
was
thus
decided
napoleon
next
asserts
that
in
the
duke
arrest
and
condemnation
all
the
usual
forms
were
strictly
observed
but
he
has
also
declared
that
the
death
of
that
unfortunate
prince
will
be
an
eternal
reproach
to
those
who
carried
away
by
a
criminal
zeal
waited
not
for
their
orders
to
execute
the
sentence
of
the
he
would
perhaps
have
allowed
the
prince
to
live
but
yet
he
said
it
is
true
i
wished
to
make
an
example
which
should
deter
it
has
been
said
that
the
due
addressed
a
letter
to
napoleon
which
was
not
delivered
till
after
the
execution
this
is
false
and
absurd
how
could
that
prince
write
to
bonaparte
to
offer
him
his
services
and
to
solicit
the
command
of
an
army
his
interrogatory
makes
no
mention
of
this
letter
and
is
in
direct
opposition
to
the
sentiments
which
that
letter
would
attribute
to
him
the
truth
is
no
such
letter
ever
existed
the
individual
who
was
with
the
prince
declared
he
never
wrote
it
it
will
never
be
believed
that
any
one
would
have
presumed
to
withhold
from
bonaparte
a
letter
on
which
depended
the
fate
of
so
august
a
victim
in
his
declarations
to
his
companions
in
exile
napoleon
endeavoured
either
to
free
himself
of
this
crime
or
to
justify
it
his
fear
or
his
susceptibility
was
such
that
in
discoursing
with
strangers
he
merely
said
that
had
he
known
of
the
prince
letter
which
was
not
delivered
to
god
knows
why
until
after
he
had
breathed
his
last
he
would
have
pardoned
him
but
at
a
subsequent
date
he
traced
with
his
own
hand
his
last
thoughts
which
he
supposed
would
be
consecrated
in
the
minds
of
his
contemporaries
and
of
posterity
napoleon
touching
on
the
subject
which
he
felt
would
be
one
of
the
most
important
attached
to
his
memory
said
that
if
the
thing
were
to
do
again
he
would
act
as
he
then
did
how
does
this
declaration
tally
with
his
avowal
that
if
he
had
received
the
prince
letter
he
should
have
lived
this
is
irreconcilable
but
if
we
compare
all
that
napoleon
said
at
helena
and
which
has
been
transmitted
to
us
by
his
faithful
followers
if
we
consider
his
contradictions
when
speaking
of
the
due
death
to
strangers
to
his
friends
to
the
public
or
to
posterity
the
question
ceases
to
be
doubtful
bonaparte
wished
to
strike
a
blow
which
would
terrify
his
enemies
fancying
that
the
duc
de
berri
was
ready
to
land
in
france
he
despatched
his
aide
de
camp
savary
in
disguise
attended
by
gendarmes
to
watch
the
duke
landing
at
biville
near
dieppe
this
turned
out
a
fruitless
mission
the
duke
was
warned
in
time
not
to
attempt
the
useless
and
dangerous
enterprise
and
bonaparte
enraged
to
see
one
prey
escape
him
pounced
upon
another
it
is
well
known
that
bonaparte
often
and
in
the
presence
even
of
persons
whom
he
conceived
to
have
maintained
relations
with
the
partisans
of
the
bourbons
at
paris
expressed
himself
thus
i
will
put
an
end
to
these
conspiracies
if
any
of
the
emigrants
conspire
they
shall
be
shot
i
have
been
told
that
cobentzel
harbours
some
of
them
i
do
not
believe
this
but
if
it
be
true
cobentzel
shall
be
arrested
and
shot
along
with
them
i
will
let
the
bourbons
know
i
am
not
to
be
trifled
with
the
above
statement
of
facts
accounts
for
the
suppositions
respecting
the
probable
influence
of
the
jacobins
in
this
affair
it
has
been
said
not
without
some
appearance
of
reason
that
to
get
the
jacobins
to
help
him
to
ascend
the
throne
bonaparte
consented
to
sacrifice
a
victim
of
the
blood
royal
as
the
only
pledge
capable
of
ensuring
them
against
the
return
of
the
proscribed
family
be
this
as
it
may
there
are
no
possible
means
of
relieving
bonaparte
from
his
share
of
guilt
in
the
death
of
the
due
to
the
above
facts
which
came
within
my
own
knowledge
i
may
add
the
following
curious
story
which
was
related
to
me
by
an
individual
who
himself
heard
it
from
the
secretary
of
general
davoust
davoust
was
commanding
a
division
in
the
camp
of
boulogne
and
his
secretary
when
proceeding
thither
to
join
him
met
in
the
diligence
a
man
who
seemed
to
be
absorbed
in
affliction
this
man
during
the
whole
journey
never
once
broke
silence
but
by
some
deep
sighs
which
he
had
not
power
to
repress
general
davoust
secretary
observed
him
with
curiosity
and
interest
but
did
not
venture
to
intrude
upon
his
grief
by
any
conversation
the
concourse
of
travellers
from
paris
to
the
camp
was
however
at
that
time
very
great
and
the
inn
at
which
the
diligence
stopped
in
the
evening
was
so
crowded
that
it
was
impossible
to
assign
a
chamber
to
each
traveller
two
therefore
were
put
into
one
room
and
it
so
happened
that
the
secretary
was
lodged
with
his
mysterious
travelling
companion
when
they
were
alone
he
addressed
him
in
a
torso
of
interest
which
banished
all
appearance
of
intrusion
he
inquired
whether
the
cause
of
his
grief
was
of
a
nature
to
admit
of
any
alleviation
and
offered
to
render
him
any
assistance
in
his
power
sir
replied
the
stranger
i
am
much
obliged
for
the
sympathy
you
express
for
me
i
want
nothing
there
is
no
possible
consolation
for
me
my
affliction
can
end
only
with
my
life
you
shall
judge
for
yourself
for
the
interest
you
seem
to
take

my
misfortune

effect
of
the
due
death

courts
remarkable
words
of
pitt

xviii
sends
back
the
insignia
of
the
golden
fleece
to
the
king
of
spain
i
will
now
narrate
more
fully
the
sanguinary
scene
which
took
place
at
vincennes
general
ordener
commanding
the
mounted
grenadiers
of
the
guard
received
orders
from
the
war
minister
to
proceed
to
the
rhine
to
give
instructions
to
the
chiefs
of
the
gendarmerie
of
new
brissac
which
was
placed
at
his
disposal
general
ordener
sent
a
detachment
of
gendarmerie
to
ettenheim
where
the
due
was
arrested
on
the
of
march
he
was
immediately
conducted
to
the
citadel
of
strasburg
where
he
remained
till
the
to
give
time
for
the
arrival
of
orders
from
paris
these
orders
were
given
rapidly
and
executed
promptly
for
the
carriage
which
conveyed
the
unfortunate
prince
arrived
at
the
barrier
at
eleven
on
the
morning
of
the
where
it
remained
for
five
hours
and
afterwards
proceeded
by
the
exterior
boulevards
on
the
road
to
vincennes
where
it
arrived
at
night
every
scene
of
this
horrible
drama
was
acted
under
the
veil
of
night
the
sun
did
not
even
shine
upon
its
tragical
close
the
soldiers
received
orders
to
proceed
to
vincennes
at
night
it
was
at
night
that
the
fatal
gates
of
the
fortress
were
closed
upon
the
prince
at
night
the
council
assembled
and
tried
him
or
rather
condemned
him
without
trial
when
the
clock
struck
six
in
the
morning
the
orders
were
given
to
fire
and
the
prince
ceased
to
exist
here
a
reflection
occurs
to
me
supposing
one
were
inclined
to
admit
that
the
council
held
on
the
of
march
had
some
connection
with
the
due
arrest
yet
as
no
council
was
held
from
the
time
of
the
duke
arrival
at
the
barrier
to
the
moment
of
his
execution
it
could
only
be
bonaparte
himself
who
issued
the
orders
which
were
too
punctually
obeyed
when
the
dreadful
intelligence
of
the
duc
death
was
spread
in
paris
it
excited
a
feeling
of
consternation
which
recalled
the
recollection
of
the
reign
of
terror
could
bonaparte
have
seen
the
gloom
which
pervaded
paris
and
compared
it
with
the
joy
which
prevailed
on
the
day
when
he
returned
victorious
from
the
field
of
marengo
he
would
have
felt
that
he
had
tarnished
his
glory
by
a
stain
which
could
never
be
effaced
about
twelve
on
the
of
march
i
was
informed
that
some
one
wished
to
speak
with
me
it
was
harrel
harrel
who
had
been
unemployed
till
the
plot
of
arena
and
ceracchi
on
the
vendemiairean
ix
october
which
he
had
feigned
to
join
and
had
then
revealed
to
the
police
see
ante
had
been
made
governor
of
vincennes
i
will
relate
word
for
word
what
he
communicated
to
me
harrel
probably
thought
that
he
was
bound
in
gratitude
to
acquaint
me
with
these
details
but
he
owed
me
no
gratitude
for
it
was
much
against
my
will
that
he
had
encouraged
the
conspiracy
of
ceracchi
and
received
the
reward
of
his
treachery
in
that
crime
the
following
is
harrel
statement
on
the
evening
of
the
day
before
yesterday
when
the
prince
arrived
i
was
asked
whether
i
had
a
room
to
lodge
a
prisoner
in
i
replied
no
that
there
were
only
my
apartments
and
the
i
was
told
to
prepare
instantly
a
room
in
which
a
prisoner
could
sleep
who
was
to
arrive
that
evening
i
was
also
desired
to
dig
a
pit
in
the
courtyard
this
fact
must
be
noted
harrel
is
told
to
dig
a
trench
before
the
sentence
thus
it
was
known
that
they
had
come
to
kill
the
duc
how
can
this
be
answered
can
it
possibly
be
supposed
that
anyone
whoever
it
was
would
have
dared
to
give
each
an
order
in
anticipation
if
the
order
had
not
been
the
carrying
out
of
a
formal
command
of
bonaparte
that
is
bourrienne
i
replied
that
that
could
not
be
easily
done
as
the
courtyard
was
paved
the
moat
was
then
fixed
upon
and
there
the
pit
was
dug
the
prince
arrived
at
seven
in
the
evening
he
was
perishing
with
cold
and
hunger
he
did
not
appear
dispirited
he
said
he
wanted
something
to
eat
and
to
go
to
bed
afterwards
his
apartment
not
being
yet
sufficiently
aired
i
took
him
into
my
own
and
sent
into
the
village
for
some
refreshment
the
prince
sat
down
to
table
and
invited
me
to
eat
with
him
he
then
asked
me
a
number
of
questions
respecting
vincennes
what
was
going
on
there
and
other
particulars
he
told
me
that
he
had
been
brought
up
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
castle
and
spoke
to
me
with
great
freedom
and
kindness
do
they
want
with
me
he
said
what
do
they
mean
to
do
with
me
but
these
questions
betrayed
no
uneasiness
or
anxiety
my
wife
who
was
ill
was
lying
in
the
same
room
in
an
alcove
closed
by
a
railing
she
heard
without
being
perceived
all
our
conversation
and
she
was
exceedingly
agitated
for
she
recognised
the
prince
whose
she
was
and
whose
family
had
given
her
a
pension
before
the
revolution
the
prince
hastened
to
bed
but
before
he
could
have
fallen
asleep
the
judges
sent
to
request
his
presence
in
the
i
was
not
present
at
his
examination
but
when
it
was
concluded
he
returned
to
his
chamber
and
when
they
came
to
read
his
sentence
to
him
he
was
in
a
profound
sleep
in
a
few
moments
after
he
was
led
out
for
execution
he
had
so
little
suspicion
of
the
fate
that
awaited
him
that
on
descending
the
staircase
leading
to
the
moat
he
asked
where
they
were
taking
him
he
received
no
answer
i
went
before
the
prince
with
a
lantern
feeling
the
cold
air
which
came
up
the
staircase
he
pressed
my
arm
and
said
they
going
to
put
me
into
a
dungeon
the
rest
is
known
i
can
yet
see
harrel
shuddering
while
thinking
of
this
action
of
the
prince
much
has
been
said
about
a
lantern
which
it
is
pretended
was
attached
to
one
of
the
due
this
is
a
pure
invention
captain
dautancourt
whose
sight
was
not
very
good
took
the
lantern
out
of
harrel
hand
to
read
the
sentence
to
the
victim
who
had
been
condemned
with
as
little
regard
to
judicial
forms
as
to
justice
this
circumstance
probably
gave
rise
to
the
story
about
the
lantern
to
which
i
have
just
alluded
the
fatal
event
took
place
at
six
on
the
morning
of
the
of
march
and
it
was
then
daylight
general
savary
did
not
dare
to
delay
the
execution
of
the
sentence
although
the
prince
urgently
demanded
to
have
an
interview
with
the
first
consul
had
bonaparte
seen
the
prince
there
can
be
little
doubt
but
that
he
would
have
saved
his
life
savary
however
thought
himself
bound
to
sacrifice
his
own
opinions
to
the
powerful
faction
which
then
controlled
the
first
consul
and
whilst
he
thought
he
was
serving
his
master
he
was
in
fact
only
serving
the
faction
to
which
i
must
say
he
did
not
belong
the
truth
is
that
general
savary
can
only
be
reproached
for
not
having
taken
upon
himself
to
suspend
the
execution
which
very
probably
would
not
have
taken
place
had
it
been
suspended
he
was
merely
an
instrument
and
regret
on
his
part
would
perhaps
have
told
more
in
his
favour
than
his
vain
efforts
to
justify
bonaparte
i
have
just
said
that
if
there
had
been
any
suspension
there
would
have
been
no
execution
and
i
think
this
is
almost
proved
by
the
uncertainty
which
must
have
existed
in
the
mind
of
the
first
consul
if
he
had
made
up
his
mind
all
the
measures
would
have
been
taken
in
advance
and
if
they
had
been
the
carriage
of
the
duke
would
certainly
not
have
been
kept
for
five
hours
at
the
barriers
besides
it
is
certain
that
the
first
intention
was
to
take
the
prince
to
the
prison
of
the
temple
from
all
that
i
have
stated
and
particularly
from
the
of
the
execution
it
appears
to
me
as
clear
as
day
that
general
savary
had
received
a
formal
order
from
bonaparte
for
the
due
death
and
also
a
formal
order
that
it
should
be
so
managed
as
to
make
it
impossible
to
speak
to
bonaparte
again
on
the
subject
until
all
should
be
over
can
there
be
a
more
evident
a
more
direct
proof
of
this
than
the
digging
of
the
grave
beforehand
i
have
repeated
harrel
story
just
as
he
related
it
to
me
he
told
it
me
without
solicitation
and
he
could
not
invent
a
circumstance
of
this
nature
general
savary
was
not
in
the
moat
during
the
execution
but
on
the
bank
from
whence
he
could
easily
see
all
that
passed
another
circumstance
connected
with
the
due
death
has
been
mentioned
which
is
true
the
prince
had
a
little
dog
this
faithful
animal
returned
incessantly
to
the
fatal
spot
in
the
moat
there
are
few
who
have
not
seen
that
spot
who
has
not
made
a
pilgrimage
to
vincennes
and
dropped
a
tear
where
the
victim
fell
the
fidelity
of
the
poor
dog
excited
so
much
interest
that
the
police
prevented
any
one
from
visiting
the
fatal
spot
and
the
dog
was
no
longer
heard
to
howl
over
his
master
grave
i
promised
to
state
the
truth
respecting
the
death
of
the
due
and
i
have
done
so
though
it
has
cost
me
some
pain
harrel
narrative
and
the
shocking
circumstance
of
the
grave
being
dug
beforehand
left
me
no
opportunity
of
cherishing
any
doubts
i
might
have
wished
to
entertain
and
everything
which
followed
confirmed
the
view
i
then
took
of
the
subject
when
harrel
left
me
on
the
i
determined
to
go
to
malmaison
to
see
madame
bonaparte
knowing
from
her
sentiments
towards
the
house
of
bourbon
that
she
would
be
in
the
greatest
affliction
i
had
previously
sent
to
know
whether
it
would
be
convenient
for
her
to
see
me
a
precaution
i
had
never
before
observed
but
which
i
conceived
to
be
proper
upon
that
occasion
on
my
arrival
i
was
immediately
introduced
to
her
boudoir
where
she
was
alone
with
hortense
and
madame
de
remusat
they
were
all
deeply
afflicted
bourrienne
exclaimed
josephine
as
soon
as
she
perceived
me
what
a
dreadful
event
did
you
but
know
the
state
of
mind
bonaparte
is
in
he
avoids
he
dreads
the
presence
of
every
one
who
could
have
suggested
to
him
such
an
act
as
this
i
then
acquainted
josephine
with
the
particulars
which
i
had
received
from
harrel
what
barbarity
she
resumed
but
no
reproach
can
rest
upon
me
for
i
did
everything
to
dissuade
him
from
this
dreadful
project
he
did
not
confide
the
secret
to
me
but
i
guessed
it
and
he
acknowledged
all
how
harshly
he
repelled
my
entreaties
i
clung
to
him
i
threw
myself
at
his
feet
with
what
concerns
you
he
exclaimed
angrily
is
not
women
business
leave
me
and
he
repulsed
me
with
a
violence
which
be
had
never
displayed
since
our
first
interview
after
your
return
from
egypt
heavens
what
will
become
of
us
i
could
say
nothing
to
calm
affliction
and
alarm
in
which
i
participated
for
to
my
grief
for
the
death
of
the
due
was
added
my
regret
that
bonaparte
should
be
capable
of
such
a
crime
what
said
josephine
can
be
thought
of
this
in
paris
he
must
be
the
object
of
universal
imprecation
for
even
here
his
flatterers
appear
astounded
when
they
are
out
of
his
presence
how
wretched
we
have
been
since
yesterday
and
he
you
know
what
he
is
when
be
is
dissatisfied
with
himself
no
one
dare
speak
to
him
and
all
is
mournful
around
us
what
a
commission
he
gave
to
savary
you
know
i
do
not
like
the
general
because
he
is
one
of
those
whose
flatteries
will
contribute
to
ruin
bonaparte
well
i
pitied
savary
when
he
came
yesterday
to
fulfil
a
commission
which
the
due
had
entrusted
to
him
here
added
josephine
is
his
portrait
and
a
lock
of
his
hair
which
he
has
requested
me
to
transmit
to
one
who
was
dear
to
him
savary
almost
shed
tears
when
he
described
to
me
the
last
moments
of
the
duke
then
endeavouring
to
resume
his
he
said
is
in
vain
to
try
to
be
indifferent
madame
it
is
impossible
to
witness
the
death
of
such
a
man
unmoved
josephine
afterwards
informed
me
of
the
only
act
of
courage
which
occurred
at
this
period
namely
the
resignation
which
de
chateaubriand
had
sent
to
bonaparte
she
admired
his
conduct
greatly
and
said
what
a
pity
he
is
not
surrounded
by
men
of
this
description
it
would
be
the
means
of
preventing
all
the
errors
into
which
he
is
led
by
the
constant
approbation
of
those
about
him
josephine
thanked
me
for
my
attention
in
coming
to
see
her
at
such
an
unhappy
juncture
and
i
confess
that
it
required
all
the
regard
i
cherished
for
her
to
induce
me
to
do
so
for
at
that
moment
i
should
not
have
wished
to
see
the
first
consul
since
the
evil
was
irreparable
on
the
evening
of
that
day
nothing
was
spoken
of
but
the
transaction
of
the
of
march
and
the
noble
conduct
of
de
chateaubriand
as
the
name
of
that
celebrated
man
is
for
ever
written
in
characters
of
honour
in
the
history
of
that
period
i
think
i
may
with
propriety
relate
here
what
i
know
respecting
his
previous
connection
with
bonaparte
i
do
not
recollect
the
precise
date
of
de
chateaubriand
return
to
france
i
only
know
that
it
was
about
the
year
for
we
were
i
think
still
at
the
luxembourg
however
i
recollect
perfectly
that
bonaparte
began
to
conceive
prejudices
against
him
and
when
i
one
day
expressed
my
surprise
to
the
first
consul
that
de
chateaubriand
name
did
not
appear
on
any
of
the
lists
which
he
had
ordered
to
be
presented
to
him
for
filling
up
vacant
places
he
said
he
has
been
mentioned
to
me
but
i
replied
in
a
way
to
check
all
hopes
of
his
obtaining
any
appointment
he
has
notions
of
liberty
and
independence
which
will
not
suit
my
system
i
would
rather
have
him
my
enemy
than
my
forced
friend
at
all
events
he
must
wait
awhile
i
may
perhaps
try
him
first
in
a
secondary
place
and
if
he
does
well
i
may
advance
him
the
above
is
word
for
word
what
bonaparte
said
the
first
time
i
conversed
with
him
about
de
chateaubriand
the
publication
of
and
the
du
christianisme
suddenly
gave
chateaubriand
celebrity
and
attracted
the
attention
of
the
first
consul
bonaparte
who
then
meditated
the
restoration
of
religious
worship
in
france
found
himself
wonderfully
supported
by
the
publication
of
a
book
which
excited
the
highest
interest
and
whose
superior
merit
led
the
public
mind
to
the
consideration
of
religious
topics
i
remember
madame
bacciocchi
coming
one
day
to
visit
her
brother
with
a
little
volume
in
her
hand
it
was
she
presented
it
to
the
first
consul
and
begged
he
would
read
it
what
more
romances
exclaimed
he
do
you
think
i
have
time
to
read
all
your
fooleries
he
however
took
the
book
from
his
sister
and
laid
it
down
on
my
desk
madame
bacciocchi
then
solicited
the
erasure
of
de
chateaubriand
name
from
the
list
of
emigrants
oh
oh
said
bonaparte
it
is
chateaubriand
book
is
it
i
will
read
it
then
bourrienne
write
to
fouche
to
erase
his
name
from
the
list
bonaparte
at
that
time
paid
so
little
attention
to
what
was
doing
in
the
literary
world
that
he
was
not
aware
of
chateaubriand
being
the
author
of
it
was
on
the
recommendation
of
de
fontanel
that
madame
bacciocchi
tried
this
experiment
which
was
attended
by
complete
success
the
first
consul
read
and
was
much
pleased
with
it
on
the
publication
of
the
du
christianisme
some
time
after
his
first
prejudices
were
wholly
removed
among
the
persons
about
him
there
were
many
who
dreaded
to
see
a
man
of
de
chateaubriand
talent
approach
the
first
consul
who
knew
how
to
appreciate
superior
merit
when
it
did
not
exite
his
envy
our
relations
with
the
court
of
the
vatican
being
renewed
and
cardinal
fesch
appointed
ambassador
to
the
holy
see
bonaparte
conceived
the
idea
of
making
de
chateaubriand
first
secretary
to
the
embassy
thinking
that
the
author
of
the
du
christianisme
was
peculiarly
fitted
to
make
up
for
his
uncle
deficiency
of
talent
in
the
capital
of
the
christian
world
which
was
destined
to
become
the
second
city
of
the
empire
it
was
not
a
little
extraordinary
to
let
a
man
previously
a
stranger
to
diplomatic
business
stepping
over
all
the
intermediate
degrees
and
being
at
once
invested
with
the
functions
of
first
secretary
to
an
important
embassy
i
oftener
than
once
heard
the
first
consul
congratulate
himself
on
having
made
the
appointment
i
knew
though
bonaparte
was
not
aware
of
the
circumstance
at
the
time
that
chateaubriand
at
first
refused
the
situation
and
that
he
was
only
induced
to
accept
it
by
the
entreaties
of
the
head
of
the
clergy
particularly
of
the
abby
emery
a
man
of
great
influence
they
represented
to
the
author
of
the
genie
du
christianisme
that
it
was
necessary
he
should
accompany
the
uncle
of
the
first
consul
to
rome
and
de
chateaubriand
accordingly
resolved
to
do
so
however
clouds
gathered
i
do
not
know
from
what
cause
between
the
ambassador
and
his
secretary
all
i
know
is
that
on
bonaparte
being
informed
of
the
circumstance
he
took
the
part
of
the
cardinal
and
the
friends
of
de
chateaubriand
expected
to
see
him
soon
deprived
of
his
appointment
when
to
the
great
astonishment
of
every
one
the
secretary
to
the
roman
embassy
far
from
being
disgraced
was
raised
by
the
first
consul
to
the
rank
of
minister
plenipotentiary
to
the
valais
with
leave
to
travel
in
switzerland
and
italy
together
with
the
promise
of
the
first
vacant
embassy
this
favour
excited
a
considerable
sensation
at
the
tuileries
but
as
it
was
known
to
be
the
will
and
pleasure
of
the
first
consul
all
expression
of
opinion
on
the
subject
was
confined
to
a
few
quiet
murmurs
that
bonaparte
had
done
for
the
name
of
chateaubriand
what
in
fact
he
had
done
only
on
account
of
his
talent
it
was
during
the
continuance
of
this
favour
that
the
second
edition
of
the
du
christianisme
was
dedicated
to
the
first
consul
de
chateaubriand
returned
to
france
previously
to
entering
on
the
fulfilment
of
his
new
mission
he
remained
for
some
months
in
paris
and
on
the
day
appointed
for
his
departure
he
went
to
take
leave
of
the
first
consul
by
a
singular
chance
it
happened
to
be
the
fatal
morning
of
the
of
march
and
consequently
only
a
few
hours
after
the
duc
had
been
shot
it
is
unnecessary
to
observe
that
de
chateaubriand
was
ignorant
of
the
fatal
event
however
on
his
return
home
he
said
to
his
friends
that
he
had
remarked
a
singular
change
in
the
appearance
of
the
first
consul
and
that
there
was
a
sort
of
sinister
expression
in
his
countenance
bonaparte
saw
his
new
minister
amidst
the
crowd
who
attended
the
audience
and
several
times
seemed
inclined
to
step
forward
to
speak
to
him
but
as
often
turned
away
and
did
not
approach
him
the
whole
morning
a
few
hours
after
when
de
chatenubriand
mentioned
his
observations
to
some
of
his
friends
he
was
made
acquainted
with
the
cause
of
that
agitation
which
in
spite
of
all
his
strength
of
mind
and
bonaparte
could
not
disguise
de
chateaubriand
instantly
resigned
his
appointment
of
minister
plenipotentiary
to
the
valais
for
several
days
his
friends
were
much
alarmed
for
his
safety
and
they
called
every
morning
early
to
ascertain
whether
he
had
not
been
carried
off
during
the
night
their
fears
were
not
without
foundation
i
must
confess
that
i
who
knew
bonaparte
well
was
somewhat
surprised
that
no
serious
consequence
attended
the
anger
he
manifested
on
receiving
the
resignation
of
the
man
who
had
dedicated
his
work
to
him
in
fact
there
was
good
reason
for
apprehension
and
it
was
not
without
considerable
difficulty
that
elisa
succeeded
in
averting
the
threatened
storm
from
this
time
began
a
state
of
hostility
between
bonaparte
and
chateaubriand
which
only
terminated
at
the
restoration
i
am
persuaded
from
my
knowledge
of
bonaparte
character
that
though
he
retained
implacable
resentment
against
a
returned
emigrant
who
had
dared
to
censure
his
conduct
in
so
positive
a
manner
yet
his
first
burst
of
anger
being
soothed
that
which
was
the
cause
of
hatred
was
at
the
same
time
the
ground
of
esteem
bonaparte
animosity
was
i
confess
very
natural
for
he
could
not
disguise
from
himself
the
real
meaning
of
a
resignation
made
under
such
circumstances
it
said
plainly
you
have
committed
a
crime
and
i
will
not
serve
your
government
which
is
stained
with
the
blood
of
a
bourbon
i
can
therefore
very
well
imagine
that
bonaparte
could
never
pardon
the
only
man
who
dared
to
give
him
such
a
lesson
in
the
midst
of
the
plenitude
of
his
power
but
as
i
have
often
had
occasion
to
remark
there
was
no
unison
between
bonaparte
feelings
and
his
judgment
i
find
a
fresh
proof
of
this
in
the
following
passage
which
he
dictated
to
de
montholon
at
helena
memoires
tome
iv
p
if
said
he
the
royal
confidence
had
not
been
placed
in
men
whose
minds
were
unstrung
by
too
important
circumstances
or
who
renegade
to
their
country
saw
no
safety
or
glory
for
their
master
throne
except
under
the
yoke
of
the
holy
alliance
if
the
duc
de
richelieu
whose
ambition
was
to
deliver
his
country
from
the
presence
of
foreign
bayonets
if
chateaubriand
who
had
just
rendered
valuable
services
at
ghent
if
they
had
had
the
direction
of
affairs
france
would
have
emerged
from
these
two
great
national
crises
powerful
and
redoubtable
chateaubriand
had
received
from
nature
the
sacred
works
show
it
his
style
is
not
that
of
racine
but
of
a
prophet
only
he
could
have
said
with
impunity
in
the
chamber
of
peers
the
redingote
and
cocked
hat
of
napoleon
put
on
a
stick
on
the
coast
of
brest
would
make
all
europe
run
to
arms
the
immediate
consequences
of
the
duc
death
were
not
confined
to
the
general
consternation
which
that
unjustifiable
stroke
of
state
policy
produced
in
the
capital
the
news
spread
rapidly
through
the
provinces
and
foreign
countries
and
was
everywhere
accompanied
by
astonishment
and
sorrow
there
is
in
the
departments
a
separate
class
of
society
possessing
great
influence
and
constituted
entirely
of
persons
usually
called
the
gentry
of
the
chateaux
who
may
be
said
to
form
the
provincial
faubourg
germain
and
who
were
overwhelmed
by
the
news
the
opinion
of
the
gentry
of
the
chateaux
was
not
hitherto
unfavourable
to
the
first
consul
for
the
law
of
hostages
which
he
repealed
had
been
felt
very
severely
by
them
with
the
exception
of
some
families
accustomed
to
consider
themselves
in
relation
to
the
whole
world
what
they
were
only
within
the
circle
of
a
couple
of
leagues
that
is
to
say
illustrious
personages
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
provinces
though
they
might
retain
some
attachment
to
the
ancient
order
of
things
had
viewed
with
satisfaction
the
substitution
of
the
consular
for
the
directorial
government
and
entertained
no
personal
dislike
to
the
first
consul
among
the
chateaux
more
than
anywhere
else
it
had
always
been
the
custom
to
cherish
utopian
ideas
respecting
the
management
of
public
affairs
and
to
criticise
the
acts
of
the
government
it
is
well
known
that
at
this
time
there
was
not
in
all
france
a
single
old
mansion
surmounted
by
its
two
weathercocks
which
had
not
a
systems
of
policy
peculiar
to
itself
and
in
which
the
question
whether
the
first
consul
would
play
the
part
of
cromwell
or
monk
was
not
frequently
canvassed
in
those
innocent
controversies
the
little
news
which
the
paris
papers
were
allowed
to
publish
was
freely
discussed
and
a
confidential
letter
from
paris
sometimes
furnished
food
for
the
conversation
of
a
whole
week
while
i
was
with
bonaparte
he
often
talked
to
me
about
the
life
in
the
chateaux
which
he
considered
as
the
happiest
for
men
with
sufficient
income
and
exempt
from
ambition
he
knew
and
could
appreciate
this
sort
of
life
for
he
often
told
me
the
period
of
his
life
which
he
remembered
with
the
greatest
pleasure
was
that
which
he
had
passed
in
a
chateau
of
the
family
of
boulat
du
colombier
near
valence
bonaparte
set
great
value
on
the
opinion
of
the
chateaux
because
while
living
in
the
country
he
had
observed
the
moral
influence
which
their
inhabitants
exercise
over
their
neighbourhood
he
had
succeeded
to
a
great
degree
in
conciliating
them
but
the
news
of
the
death
of
the
due
alienated
from
him
minds
which
were
still
wavering
and
even
those
which
had
already
declared
in
his
favour
that
act
of
tyranny
dissolved
the
charm
which
had
created
hope
from
his
government
and
awakened
affections
which
had
as
yet
only
slumbered
those
to
whom
this
event
was
almost
indifferent
also
joined
in
condemning
it
for
there
are
certain
aristocratic
ideas
which
are
always
fashionable
in
a
certain
class
of
society
thus
for
different
causes
this
atrocity
gave
a
retrograde
direction
to
public
opinion
which
had
previously
been
favourably
disposed
to
bonaparte
throughout
the
whole
of
france
the
consequences
were
not
less
important
and
might
have
been
disastrous
with
respect
to
foreign
courts
i
learned
through
a
channel
which
does
not
permit
me
to
entertain
any
doubt
of
the
correctness
of
my
information
that
as
soon
as
the
emperor
alexander
received
the
news
it
became
clear
that
england
might
conceive
a
hope
of
forming
a
new
coalition
against
france
alexander
openly
expressed
his
indignation
i
also
learned
with
equal
certainty
that
when
pitt
was
informed
of
the
death
of
the
french
prince
he
said
bonaparte
has
now
done
himself
more
mischief
than
we
have
done
him
since
the
last
declaration
of
war
the
remark
made
on
this
murder
by
the
astute
fouche
is
well
known
he
said
it
was
worse
than
a
crime
it
was
a
blunder
editor
of
edition
pitt
was
not
the
man
to
feel
much
concern
for
the
death
of
any
one
but
he
understood
and
seized
all
the
advantages
afforded
to
him
by
this
great
error
of
policy
committed
by
the
most
formidable
enemy
of
england
in
all
the
treasury
journals
published
in
london
bonaparte
was
never
spoken
of
under
any
other
name
than
that
of
the
assassin
of
the
duc
the
inert
policy
of
the
cabinet
of
vienna
prevented
the
manifestation
of
its
displeasure
by
remonstrances
or
by
any
outward
act
at
berlin
in
consequence
of
the
neighbourhood
of
the
french
troops
in
hanover
the
commiseration
for
the
death
of
the
due
was
also
confined
to
the
king
cabinet
and
more
particularly
to
the
salons
of
the
queen
of
prussia
but
it
is
certain
that
that
transaction
almost
everywhere
changed
the
disposition
of
sovereigns
towards
the
first
consul
and
that
if
it
did
not
cause
it
at
least
hastened
the
success
of
the
negotiations
which
england
was
secretly
carrying
on
with
austria
and
prussia
every
prince
of
germany
was
offended
by
the
violation
of
the
grand
duke
of
baden
territory
and
the
death
of
a
prince
could
not
fail
everywhere
to
irritate
that
kind
of
sympathy
of
blood
and
of
race
which
had
hitherto
always
influenced
the
crowned
heads
and
sovereign
families
of
europe
for
it
was
felt
as
an
injury
to
all
of
them
when
louis
xviii
learned
the
death
of
the
due
he
wrote
to
the
king
of
spain
returning
him
the
insignia
of
the
order
of
the
golden
fleece
which
had
also
been
conferred
on
bonaparte
with
the
accompanying
letter
sire
monsieur
and
dear
cousin
it
is
with
regret
that
i
send
back
to
you
the
insignia
of
the
order
of
the
golden
fleece
which
his
majesty
your
father
of
glorious
memory
conferred
upon
me
there
can
be
nothing
in
common
between
me
and
the
great
criminal
whom
audacity
and
fortune
have
placed
on
my
throne
since
he
has
had
the
barbarity
to
stain
himself
with
the
blood
of
a
bourbon
the
duc
religion
might
make
me
pardon
an
assassin
but
the
tyrant
of
my
people
must
always
be
my
enemy
in
the
present
age
it
is
more
glorious
to
merit
a
sceptre
than
to
possess
one
providence
for
incomprehensible
reasons
may
condemn
me
to
end
my
days
in
exile
but
neither
my
contemporaries
nor
posterity
shall
ever
have
to
say
that
in
the
period
of
adversity
i
showed
my
self
unworthy
of
occupying
the
throne
of
my
ancestors
louis
the
death
of
the
due
was
a
horrible
episode
in
the
proceedings
of
the
great
trial
which
was
then
preparing
and
which
was
speedily
followed
by
the
accession
of
bonaparte
to
the
imperial
dignity
it
was
not
one
of
the
least
remarkable
anomalies
of
the
epoch
to
see
the
judgment
by
which
criminal
enterprises
against
the
republic
were
condemned
pronounced
in
the
name
of
the
emperor
who
had
so
evidently
destroyed
that
republic
this
anomaly
certainly
was
not
removed
by
the
subtlety
by
the
aid
of
which
he
at
first
declared
himself
emperor
of
the
republic
as
a
preliminary
to
his
proclaiming
himself
emperor
of
the
french
setting
aside
the
means
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
it
is
impossible
not
to
admire
the
genius
of
bonaparte
his
tenacity
in
advancing
towards
his
object
and
that
adroit
employment
of
suppleness
and
audacity
which
made
him
sometimes
dare
fortune
sometimes
avoid
difficulties
which
he
found
insurmountable
to
arrive
not
merely
at
the
throne
of
louis

at

reconstructed

shall
now
proceed
to
relate
what
i
knew
at
the
time
and
what
i
have
since
learnt
of
the
different
phases
of
the
trial
of
georges
pichegru
moreau
and
the
other
persons
accused
of
conspiracy
a
trial
to
all
the
proceedings
of
which
i
closely
attended
from
those
proceedings
i
was
convinced
that
moreau
was
no
conspirator
but
at
the
same
time
i
must
confess
that
it
is
very
probable
the
first
consul
might
believe
that
he
had
been
engaged
in
the
plot
and
i
am
also
of
opinion
that
the
real
conspirators
believed
moreau
to
be
their
accomplice
and
their
chief
for
the
object
of
the
machinations
of
the
police
agents
was
to
create
a
foundation
for
such
a
belief
it
being
important
to
the
success
of
their
scheme
it
has
been
stated
that
moreau
was
arrested
on
the
day
after
the
confessions
made
by
bouvet
de
lozier
pichegru
was
taken
by
means
of
the
most
infamous
treachery
that
a
man
can
be
guilty
of
the
official
police
had
at
last
ascertained
that
he
was
in
paris
but
they
could
not
learn
the
place
of
his
concealment
the
police
agents
had
in
vain
exerted
all
their
efforts
to
discover
him
when
an
old
friend
who
had
given
him
his
last
asylum
offered
to
deliver
him
up
for
crowns
this
infamous
fellow
gave
an
enact
description
of
the
chamber
which
pichegru
occupied
in
the
rue
de
chabanais
and
in
consequence
of
his
information
comminges
commissary
of
police
proceeded
thither
accompanied
by
some
determined
men
precautions
were
necessary
because
it
was
known
that
pichegru
was
a
man
of
prodigious
bodily
strength
and
that
besides
as
he
possessed
the
means
of
defence
he
would
not
allow
himself
to
be
taken
without
making
a
desperate
resistance
the
police
entered
his
chamber
by
using
false
keys
which
the
man
who
had
sold
him
had
the
baseness
to
get
made
for
them
a
light
was
burning
on
his
night
table
the
party
of
police
directed
by
comminges
overturned
the
table
extinguished
the
light
and
threw
themselves
on
the
general
who
struggled
with
all
his
strength
and
cried
out
loudly
they
were
obliged
to
bind
him
and
in
this
state
the
conqueror
of
holland
was
removed
to
the
temple
out
of
which
he
was
destined
never
to
come
alive
it
must
be
owned
that
pichegru
was
far
from
exciting
the
same
interest
as
moreau
the
public
and
more
especially
the
army
never
pardoned
him
for
his
negotiations
with
the
prince
de
conde
prior
to
the
fructidor
however
i
became
acquainted
with
a
trait
respecting
him
while
he
was
in
paris
which
i
think
does
him
much
honour
a
son
of
lagrenee
formerly
director
of
the
french
academy
at
rome
had
been
one
of
pichegru
aides
de
camp
this
young
man
though
he
had
obtained
the
rank
of
captain
resigned
on
the
banishment
of
his
general
and
resumed
the
pencil
which
he
had
lad
aside
for
the
sword
pichegru
while
he
was
concealed
in
paris
visited
his
former
aide
de
camp
who
insisted
upon
giving
him
an
asylum
but
pichegru
positively
refused
to
accept
lagrenee
offer
being
determined
not
to
commit
a
man
who
had
already
given
him
so
strong
a
proof
of
friendship
i
learned
this
fact
by
a
singular
coincidence
at
this
period
madame
de
bourrienne
wished
to
have
a
portrait
of
one
of
our
children
she
was
recommended
to
lagrenee
and
he
related
the
circumstance
to
her
it
was
on
the
night
of
the
of
february
that
pichegru
was
arrested
in
the
manner
i
have
described
the
deceitful
friend
who
gave
him
up
was
named
le
blanc
and
he
went
to
settle
at
hamburg
with
the
reward
of
his
treachery
i
had
entirely
lost
sight
of
pichegru
since
we
left
brienne
for
pichegru
was
also
a
pupil
of
that
establishment
but
being
older
than
either
bonaparte
or
i
he
was
already
a
tutor
when
we
were
only
scholars
and
i
very
well
recollect
that
it
was
he
who
examined
bonaparte
in
the
four
first
rules
of
arithmetic
pichegru
belonged
to
an
agricultural
family
of
he
had
a
relation
a
minim
in
that
country
the
minim
who
had
the
charge
of
educating
the
pupils
of
the
military
school
of
brienne
being
very
poor
and
their
poverty
not
enabling
them
to
hold
out
much
inducement
to
other
persons
to
assist
them
they
applied
to
the
minims
of
in
consequence
of
this
application
pichegru
relation
and
some
other
minims
repaired
to
brienne
an
aunt
of
pichegru
who
was
a
sister
of
the
order
of
charity
accompanied
them
and
the
care
of
the
infirmary
was
entrusted
to
her
this
good
woman
took
her
nephew
to
brienne
with
her
and
he
was
educated
at
the
school
gratuitously
as
soon
as
his
age
permitted
pichegru
was
made
a
tutor
but
all
his
ambition
was
to
become
a
minim
he
was
however
dissuaded
from
that
pursuit
by
his
relation
and
he
adopted
the
military
profession
there
is
this
further
remarkable
circumstance
in
the
youth
of
pichegru
that
though
he
was
older
by
several
years
than
bonaparte
they
were
both
made
lieutenants
of
artillery
at
the
same
time
what
a
difference
in
their
destiny
while
the
one
was
preparing
to
ascend
a
throne
the
other
was
a
solitary
prisoner
in
the
dungeon
of
the
temple
i
had
no
motive
to
induce
me
to
visit
either
the
temple
or
la
force
but
i
received
at
the
time
circumstantial
details
of
what
was
passing
in
those
prisons
particularly
in
the
former
i
went
however
frequently
to
pelagie
where
carbonnet
was
confined
as
soon
as
i
knew
that
he
was
lodged
in
that
prison
i
set
about
getting
an
admission
from
real
who
smoothed
all
difficulties
carbonnet
was
detained
two
months
in
solitary
confinement
he
was
several
times
examined
but
the
interrogatories
produced
no
result
and
notwithstanding
the
desire
to
implicate
him
in
consequence
of
the
known
intimacy
between
him
and
moreau
it
was
at
last
found
impossible
to
put
him
on
trial
with
the
other
parties
accused
the
temple
had
more
terrors
than
pelagie
but
not
for
the
prisoners
who
were
committed
to
it
for
none
of
those
illustrious
victims
of
police
machination
displayed
any
weakness
with
the
exception
of
bouvet
de
lozier
who
being
sensible
of
his
weakness
wished
to
prevent
its
consequences
by
death
the
public
however
kept
their
attention
riveted
on
the
prison
in
which
moreau
was
confined
i
have
already
mentioned
that
pichegru
was
conveyed
thither
on
the
night
of
the
of
february
a
fortnight
later
georges
was
arrested
and
committed
to
the
same
prison
either
real
or
desmarets
and
sometimes
both
together
repaired
to
the
temple
to
examine
the
prisoners
in
vain
the
police
endeavoured
to
direct
public
odium
against
the
prisoners
by
placarding
lists
of
their
names
through
the
whole
of
paris
even
before
they
were
arrested
in
those
lists
they
were
styled
brigands
and
at
the
head
of
the
brigands
the
name
of
general
moreau
shone
conspicuously
an
absurdity
without
a
parallel
the
effect
produced
was
totally
opposite
to
that
calculated
on
for
as
no
person
could
connect
the
idea
of
a
brigand
with
that
of
a
general
who
was
the
object
of
public
esteem
it
was
naturally
concluded
that
those
whose
names
were
placarded
along
with
his
were
no
more
brigands
than
he
public
opinion
was
decidedly
in
favour
of
moreau
and
every
one
was
indignant
at
seeing
him
described
as
a
brigand
far
from
believing
him
guilty
he
was
regarded
as
a
victim
fastened
on
because
his
reputation
embarrassed
bonaparte
for
moreau
had
always
been
looked
up
to
as
capable
of
opposing
the
accomplishment
of
the
first
consul
ambitious
views
the
whole
crime
of
moreau
was
his
having
numerous
partisans
among
those
who
still
clung
to
the
phantom
of
the
republic
and
that
crime
was
unpardonable
in
the
eyes
of
the
first
consul
who
for
two
years
had
ruled
the
destinies
of
france
as
sovereign
master
what
means
were
not
employed
to
mislead
the
opinion
of
the
public
respecting
moreau
the
police
published
pamphlets
of
all
sorts
and
the
comte
de
montgaillard
was
brought
from
lyons
to
draw
up
a
libel
implicating
him
with
pichegru
and
the
exiled
princes
but
nothing
that
was
done
produced
the
effect
proposed
the
weak
character
of
moreau
is
known
in
fact
he
allowed
himself
to
be
circumvented
by
a
few
intriguers
who
endeavoured
to
derive
advantage
from
the
influence
of
his
name
but
he
was
so
decidedly
opposed
to
the
reestablishment
of
the
ancient
system
that
he
replied
to
one
of
the
agents
who
addressed
him
i
can
not
put
myself
at
the
head
of
any
movement
for
the
bourbons
and
such
an
attempt
would
not
succeed
if
pichegru
act
on
another
principle
and
even
in
that
case
i
have
told
him
that
the
consuls
and
the
governor
of
paris
must
disappear
i
believe
that
i
have
a
party
strong
enough
in
the
senate
to
obtain
possession
of
authority
and
i
will
immediately
make
use
of
it
to
protect
his
friends
public
opinion
will
then
dictate
what
may
be
fit
to
be
done
but
i
will
promise
nothing
in
writing
admitting
these
words
attributed
to
moreau
to
be
true
they
prove
that
he
was
dissatisfied
with
the
consular
government
and
that
he
wished
a
change
but
there
is
a
great
difference
between
a
conditional
wish
and
a
conspiracy
the
commander
of
the
principal
guard
of
the
temple
was
general
savory
and
he
had
reinforced
that
guard
by
his
select
gendarmerie
the
prisoners
did
not
dare
to
communicate
one
with
another
for
fear
of
mutual
injury
but
all
evinced
a
courage
which
created
no
little
alarm
as
to
the
consequences
of
the
trial
neither
offers
nor
threats
produced
any
confessions
in
the
course
of
the
interrogatories
pichegru
in
particular
displayed
an
extraordinary
firmness
and
real
one
day
on
leaving
the
chamber
where
he
had
been
examining
him
said
aloud
in
the
presence
of
several
persons
what
a
man
that
pichegru
is
forty
days
elapsed
after
the
arrest
of
general
pichegru
when
on
the
morning
of
the
of
april
he
was
found
dead
in
the
chamber
he
occupied
in
the
temple
pichegru
had
undergone
ten
examinations
but
he
had
made
no
confessions
and
no
person
was
committed
by
his
replies
all
his
declarations
however
gave
reason
to
believe
that
he
would
speak
out
and
that
too
in
a
lofty
and
energetic
manner
during
the
progress
of
the
trial
when
i
am
before
my
judges
said
he
my
language
shall
be
conformable
to
truth
and
the
interests
of
my
country
what
would
that
language
have
been
without
doubt
there
was
no
wish
that
it
should
be
heard
pichegru
would
have
kept
his
promise
for
he
was
distinguished
for
his
firmness
of
character
above
everything
even
above
his
qualities
as
a
soldier
differing
in
this
respect
from
moreau
who
allowed
himself
to
be
guided
by
his
wife
and
both
of
whom
displayed
ridiculous
pretensions
in
their
visits
to
madame
bonaparte
the
day
on
which
real
spoke
before
several
persons
of
pichegru
in
the
way
i
have
related
was
the
day
of
his
last
examination
i
afterwards
learned
from
a
source
on
which
i
can
rely
that
during
his
examination
pichegru
though
careful
to
say
nothing
which
could
affect
the
other
prisoners
showed
no
disposition
to
be
tender
of
him
who
had
sought
and
resolved
his
death
but
evinced
a
firm
resolution
to
unveil
before
the
public
the
odious
machinery
of
the
plot
into
which
the
police
had
drawn
him
he
also
declared
that
he
and
his
companions
had
no
longer
any
object
but
to
consider
of
the
means
of
leaving
paris
with
the
view
of
escaping
from
the
snares
laid
for
them
when
their
arrest
took
place
he
declared
that
they
had
all
of
them
given
up
the
idea
of
overturning
the
power
of
bonaparte
a
scheme
into
which
they
had
been
enticed
by
shameful
intrigues
i
am
convinced
the
dread
excited
by
his
manifestation
of
a
resolution
to
speak
out
with
the
most
rigid
candour
hastened
the
death
of
pichegru
real
who
is
still
living
knows
better
than
any
one
else
what
were
pichegru
declarations
as
he
interrogated
him
i
know
not
whether
that
gentleman
will
think
fit
either
at
the
present
or
some
future
period
to
raise
the
veil
of
mystery
which
hangs
over
these
events
but
of
this
i
am
sure
he
will
be
unable
to
deny
anything
i
advance
there
is
evidence
almost
amounting
to
demonstration
that
pichegru
was
strangled
in
prison
and
consequently
all
idea
of
suicide
must
be
rejected
as
inadmissible
have
i
positive
and
substantive
proof
of
what
i
assert
i
have
not
but
the
concurrence
of
facts
and
the
weight
of
probabilities
do
not
leave
me
in
possession
of
the
doubts
i
should
wish
to
entertain
on
that
tragic
event
besides
there
exists
a
certain
popular
instinct
which
is
rarely
at
fault
and
it
must
be
in
the
recollection
of
many
not
only
that
the
general
opinion
favoured
the
notion
of
pichegru
assassination
but
that
the
pains
taken
to
give
that
opinion
another
direction
by
the
affected
exhibition
of
the
body
only
served
to
strengthen
it
he
who
spontaneously
says
i
have
not
committed
such
or
such
a
crime
at
least
admits
there
is
room
for
suspecting
his
guilt
the
truth
is
the
tide
of
opinion
never
set
in
with
such
force
against
bonaparte
as
during
the
trial
of
moreau
nor
was
the
popular
sentiment
in
error
on
the
subject
of
the
death
of
pichegru
who
was
clearly
strangled
in
the
temple
by
secret
agents
the
authors
the
actors
and
the
witnesses
of
the
horrible
prison
scenes
of
the
period
are
the
only
persons
capable
of
removing
the
doubts
which
still
hang
over
the
death
of
pichegru
but
i
must
nevertheless
contend
that
the
preceding
circumstances
the
general
belief
at
the
time
and
even
probability
are
in
contradiction
with
any
idea
of
suicide
on
the
part
of
pichegru
his
death
was
considered
necessary
and
this
necessity
was
its
real
cause

was

in

on

had
no

been
directed
by
the

agent
who
was
constantly
about
him
in
not
seizing

at

the

probably
was

to
produce

cost

named
caron
it
is
difficult
to
suppose
that
the
circumstance
of
the

being
on
the
spot
was
the
mere
effect
of
chance
the
daughter
was
putting
into
the
cabriolet
a
parcel
belonging
to
georges
at
the
moment
of
his
arrest
georges
seeing
the
officers
advance
to
seize
him
desired
the
girl
to
get
out
of
the
way
fearing
lest
he
should
shoot
her
when
he
fired
on
the
officers
she
ran
into
a
neighbouring
house
taking
the
parcel
along
with
her
the
police
it
may
readily
be
supposed
were
soon
after
her
the
master
of
the
house
in
which
she
had
taken
refuge
curious
to
know
what
the
parcel
contained
had
opened
it
and
discovered
among
other
things
a
bag
containing
dutch
sovereigns
from
which
he
acknowledged
he
had
abstracted
a
considerable
sum
he
and
his
wife
as
well
as
the
fruiterer
daughter
were
all
arrested
as
to
georges
he
was
taken
that
same
evening
to
the
temple
where
he
remained
until
his
removal
to
the
conciergerie
when
the
trial
commenced
during
the
whole
of
the
legal
proceedings
georges
and
the
other
important
prisoners
were
kept
in
solitary
confinement
immediately
on
death
the
prisoners
were
informed
of
the
circumstance
as
they
were
all
acquainted
with
the
general
and
none
believed
the
fact
of
his
reported
suicide
it
may
easily
be
conceived
what
consternation
and
horror
the
tragical
event
excited
among
them
i
learned
and
i
was
sorry
to
hear
of
it
that
louis
bonaparte
who
was
an
excellent
man
and
beyond
all
comparison
the
best
of
the
family
had
the
cruel
curiosity
to
see
georges
in
his
prison
a
few
days
after
the
death
of
pichegru
and
when
the
sensation
of
horror
excited
by
that
event
in
the
interior
of
the
temple
was
at
its
height
louis
repaired
to
the
prison
accompanied
by
a
brilliant
escort
of
and
general
savary
introduced
him
to
the
prisoners
when
louis
arrived
georges
was
lying
on
his
bed
with
his
hands
strongly
bound
by
manacles
lauriston
who
accompanied
louis
related
to
me
some
of
the
particulars
of
this
visit
which
in
spite
of
his
sincere
devotedness
to
the
first
consul
he
assured
me
had
been
very
painful
to
him
after
the
arrest
of
georges
there
were
still
some
individuals
marked
out
as
accomplices
in
the
conspiracy
who
had
found
means
to
elude
the
search
of
the
police
the
persons
last
arrested
were
i
think
villeneuve
of
the
principal
confidants
of
georges
burban
malabre
who
went
by
the
name
of
barco
and
charles
they
were
not
taken
till
five
days
after
the
arrest
of
the
duc
the
famous
commissioner
comminges
accompanied
by
an
inspector
and
a
detachment
of
gendarmes
found
villeneuve
and
burban
malabre
in
the
house
of
a
man
named
dubuisson
in
the
rue
jean
robert
this
dubuisson
and
his
wife
had
sheltered
some
of
the
principal
persons
proscribed
by
the
police
the
messieurs
de
polignac
and
de
riviere
had
lodged
with
them
when
the
police
came
to
arrest
villeneuve
and
burban
malabre
the
people
with
whom
they
lodged
declared
that
they
had
gone
away
in
the
morning
the
officers
however
searched
the
house
and
discovered
a
secret
door
within
a
closet
they
called
and
receiving
no
answer
the
gendarmerie
had
recourse
to
one
of
those
expedients
which
were
unfortunately
too
familiar
to
them
they
fired
a
pistol
through
the
door
villeneuve
who
went
by
the
name
of
joyau
was
wounded
in
the
arm
which
obliged
him
and
his
companion
to
come
from
the
place
of
their
concealment
and
they
were
then
made
prisoners
moreau
was
not
treated
with
the
degree
of
rigour
observed
towards
the
other
prisoners
indeed
it
would
not
have
been
safe
so
to
treat
him
for
even
in
his
prison
he
received
the
homage
and
respect
of
all
the
military
not
excepting
even
those
who
were
his
guards
many
of
these
soldiers
had
served
under
him
and
it
could
not
be
forgotten
how
much
he
was
beloved
by
the
troops
he
had
commanded
he
did
not
possess
that
irresistible
charm
which
in
bonaparte
excited
attachment
but
his
mildness
of
temper
and
excellent
character
inspired
love
and
respect
it
was
the
general
opinion
in
paris
that
a
single
word
from
moreau
to
the
soldiers
in
whose
custody
he
was
placed
would
in
a
moment
have
converted
the
into
a
guard
of
honour
ready
to
execute
all
that
might
be
required
for
the
safety
of
the
conqueror
of
hohenlinden
perhaps
the
respect
with
which
he
was
treated
and
the
indulgence
of
daily
seeing
his
wife
and
child
were
but
artful
calculations
for
keeping
him
within
the
limits
of
his
usual
character
besides
moreau
was
so
confident
of
the
injustice
of
the
charge
brought
against
him
that
he
was
calm
and
resigned
and
showed
no
disposition
to
rouse
the
anger
of
an
enemy
who
would
have
been
happy
to
have
some
real
accusation
against
him
to
these
causes
combined
i
always
attributed
the
resignation
and
i
may
say
the
indifference
of
moreau
while
he
was
in
prison
and
on
his
trial
when
the
legal
preparations
for
the
trial
were
ended
the
prisoners
of
the
temple
were
permitted
to
communicate
with
each
other
and
viewing
their
fate
with
that
indifference
which
youth
misfortune
and
courage
inspired
they
amused
themselves
with
some
of
those
games
which
usually
serve
for
boyish
recreation
while
they
were
thus
engaged
the
order
arrived
for
their
removal
to
the
conciergerie
the
firmness
of
all
remained
unshaken
and
they
made
their
preparations
for
departure
as
if
they
were
going
about
any
ordinary
business
this
fortitude
was
particularly
remarkable
in
georges
in
whose
manner
a
change
had
taken
place
which
was
remarked
by
all
his
companions
in
misfortune
for
some
time
past
the
agents
of
government
throughout
france
had
been
instructed
to
solicit
the
first
consul
to
grant
for
the
people
what
the
people
did
not
want
but
what
bonaparte
wished
to
take
while
he
appeared
to
yield
to
the
general
will
namely
unlimited
sovereign
authority
free
from
any
subterfuge
of
denomination
the
opportunity
of
the
great
conspiracy
just
discovered
and
in
which
bonaparte
had
not
incurred
a
moment
danger
as
he
did
at
the
time
of
the
infernal
machine
was
not
suffered
to
escape
that
opportunity
was
on
the
contrary
eagerly
seized
by
the
authorities
of
every
rank
civil
ecclesiastical
and
military
and
a
torrent
of
addresses
congratulations
and
thanksgivings
inundated
the
tuileries
most
of
the
authors
of
these
addressee
did
not
confine
themselves
to
mere
congratulations
they
entreated
bonaparte
to
consolidate
his
work
the
true
meaning
of
which
was
that
it
was
time
he
should
make
himself
emperor
and
establish
hereditary
succession
those
who
on
other
occasions
had
shown
an
officious
readiness
to
execute
bonaparte
commands
did
not
now
fear
to
risk
his
displeasure
by
opposing
the
opinion
he
had
expressed
in
the
council
of
state
on
the
discussion
of
the
question
of
the
consulate
for
life
bonaparte
then
said
hereditary
succession
is
absurd
it
is
irreconcilable
with
the
principle
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
and
impossible
in
france
in
this
scene
of
the
grand
drama
bonaparte
played
his
part
with
his
accustomed
talent
keeping
himself
in
the
background
and
leaving
to
others
the
task
of
preparing
the
catastrophe
the
senate
who
took
the
lead
in
the
way
of
insinuation
did
not
fail
while
congratulating
the
first
consul
on
his
escape
from
the
plots
of
foreigners
or
as
they
were
officially
styled
the
daggers
of
england
to
conjure
him
not
to
delay
the
completion
of
his
work
six
days
after
the
death
of
the
due
the
senate
first
expressed
this
wish
either
because
bonaparte
began
to
repent
of
a
useless
crime
and
felt
the
ill
effect
it
must
produce
on
the
public
mind
or
because
he
found
the
language
of
the
senate
somewhat
vague
he
left
the
address
nearly
a
month
unanswered
and
then
only
replied
by
the
request
that
the
intention
of
the
address
might
be
more
completely
expressed
these
negotiations
between
the
senate
and
the
head
of
the
government
were
not
immediately
published
bonaparte
did
not
like
publicity
except
for
what
had
arrived
at
a
result
but
to
attain
the
result
which
was
the
object
of
his
ambition
it
was
necessary
that
the
project
which
he
was
maturing
should
be
introduced
in
the
tribunate
and
the
tribune
curee
had
the
honour
to
be
the
first
to
propose
officially
on
the
of
april
the
conversion
of
the
consular
republic
into
an
empire
and
the
elevation
of
bonaparte
to
the
title
of
emperor
with
the
rights
of
hereditary
succession
if
any
doubts
could
exist
respecting
the
complaisant
part
which
curee
acted
on
this
occasion
one
circumstance
would
suffice
to
remove
them
that
is
that
ten
days
before
the
development
of
his
proposition
bonaparte
had
caused
the
question
of
founding
the
empire
and
establishing
hereditary
succession
in
his
family
to
be
secretly
discussed
in
the
council
of
state
i
learned
from
one
of
the
councillors
of
state
all
that
passed
on
that
occasion
and
i
may
remark
that
cambaceres
showed
himself
particularly
eager
in
the
council
of
state
as
well
as
afterwards
in
the
senate
to
become
the
exalted
subject
of
him
who
had
been
his
first
colleague
in
the
consulate
about
the
middle
of
april
the
council
of
state
being
assembled
as
for
an
ordinary
sitting
the
first
consul
who
was
frequently
present
at
the
sittings
did
not
appear
cambaceres
arrived
and
took
the
presidency
in
his
quality
of
second
consul
and
it
was
remarked
that
his
air
was
more
solemn
than
usual
though
he
at
all
times
affected
gravity
the
partisans
of
hereditary
succession
were
the
majority
and
resolved
to
present
an
address
to
the
first
consul
those
of
the
councillors
who
opposed
this
determined
on
their
part
to
send
a
and
to
avoid
this
clashing
of
opinions
bonaparte
signified
his
wish
that
each
member
of
the
council
should
send
him
his
opinion
individually
with
his
signature
affixed
by
a
singular
accident
it
happened
to
be
task
to
present
to
the
first
consul
the
separate
opinions
of
the
council
out
of
the
councillors
present
only
seven
opposed
the
question
bonaparte
received
them
all
most
graciously
and
told
them
among
other
things
that
be
wished
for
hereditary
power
only
for
the
benefit
of
france
that
the
citizens
would
never
be
his
subjects
and
that
the
french
people
would
never
be
his
people
such
were
the
preliminaries
to
the
official
proposition
of
curee
to
the
tribunate
and
upon
reflection
it
was
decided
that
as
all
opposition
would
be
useless
and
perhaps
dangerous
to
the
opposing
party
the
minority
should
join
the
majority
this
was
accordingly
done
the
tribunate
having
adopted
the
proposition
of
curee
there
was
no
longer
any
motive
for
concealing
the
overtures
of
the
senate
its
address
to
the
first
consul
was
therefore
published
forty
days
after
its
date
the
pear
was
then
ripe
this
period
is
so
important
that
i
must
not
omit
putting
together
the
most
remarkable
facts
which
either
came
within
my
own
observation
or
which
i
have
learned
since
respecting
the
foundation
of
the
empire
bonaparte
had
a
long
time
before
spoken
to
me
of
the
title
of
emperor
as
being
the
most
appropriate
for
the
new
sovereignty
which
he
wished
to
found
in
france
this
he
observed
was
not
restoring
the
old
system
entirely
and
he
dwelt
much
on
its
being
the
title
which
caesar
had
borne
he
often
said
one
may
be
the
emperor
of
a
republic
but
not
the
king
of
a
republic
those
two
terms
are
incongruous
in
its
first
address
the
senate
had
taken
as
a
test
the
documents
it
had
received
from
the
government
in
relation
to
the
intrigues
of
drake
who
had
been
sent
from
england
to
munich
that
text
afforded
the
opportunity
for
a
vague
expression
of
what
the
senate
termed
the
necessities
of
france
to
give
greater
solemnity
to
the
affair
the
senate
proceeded
in
a
body
to
the
tuileries
and
one
thing
which
gave
a
peculiar
character
to
the
preconcerted
advances
of
the
senate
was
that
cambaceres
the
second
consul
fulfilled
his
functions
of
president
on
this
occasion
and
delivered
the
address
to
the
first
consul
however
the
first
consul
thought
the
address
of
the
senate
which
i
have
been
informed
was
drawn
up
by
francois
de
neufchateau
was
not
expressed
with
sufficient
clearness
he
therefore
after
suffering
a
little
interval
to
elapse
sent
a
message
to
the
senate
signed
by
himself
in
which
he
said
your
address
has
been
the
object
of
my
earnest
consideration
and
though
the
address
contained
no
mention
of
hereditary
succession
he
added
you
consider
the
hereditary
succession
of
the
supreme
magistracy
necessary
to
defend
the
french
people
against
the
plots
of
our
enemies
and
the
agitation
arising
from
rival
ambition
at
the
same
time
several
of
our
institutions
appear
to
you
to
require
improvement
so
as
to
ensure
the
triumph
of
equality
and
public
liberty
and
to
offer
to
the
nation
and
the
government
the
double
guarantee
they
require
from
the
subsequent
passages
of
the
message
it
will
be
sufficient
to
extract
the
following
we
have
been
constantly
guided
by
this
great
truth
that
the
sovereignty
dwells
with
the
french
people
and
that
it
is
for
their
interest
happiness
and
glory
that
the
supreme
magistracy
the
senate
the
council
of
state
the
legislative
body
the
electoral
colleges
and
the
different
branches
of
the
government
are
and
must
be
instituted
the
omission
of
the
tribunate
in
this
enumeration
is
somewhat
remarkable
it
announced
a
promise
which
was
speedily
realised
the
will
of
bonaparte
being
thus
expressed
in
his
message
to
the
senate
that
body
which
was
created
to
preserve
the
institutions
consecrated
by
the
constitution
of
the
year
had
no
alternative
but
to
submit
to
the
intentions
manifested
by
the
first
consul
the
reply
to
the
message
was
therefore
merely
a
counterpart
of
the
message
itself
it
positively
declared
that
hereditary
government
was
essential
to
the
happiness
the
glory
and
the
prosperity
of
france
and
that
that
government
could
be
confided
only
to
bonaparte
and
his
family
while
the
senate
so
complaisantly
played
its
part
in
this
piece
yet
the
better
to
impose
on
the
credulity
of
the
multitude
its
reply
like
bonaparte
message
resounded
with
the
words
liberty
and
equality
indeed
it
was
impudently
asserted
in
that
reply
that
accession
to
hereditary
power
would
be
a
certain
guarantee
for
the
liberty
of
the
press
a
liberty
which
bonaparte
held
in
the
greatest
horror
and
without
which
all
other
liberty
is
but
a
vain
illusion
by
this
reply
of
the
senate
the
most
important
step
was
performed
there
now
remained
merely
ceremonies
to
regulate
and
formulas
to
fill
up
these
various
arrangements
occasioned
a
delay
of
a
fortnight
on
the
of
may
the
first
consul
was
greeted
for
the
first
time
by
the
appellation
of
sire
by
his
former
colleague
cambaceres
who
at
the
head
of
the
senate
went
to
present
to
bonaparte
the
organic
containing
the
foundation
of
the
empire
napoleon
was
at
st
cloud
whither
the
senate
proceeded
in
state
after
the
speech
of
cambaceres
in
which
the
old
designation
of
majesty
was
for
the
first
time
revived
the
emperor
replied
all
that
can
contribute
to
the
welfare
of
the
country
is
essentially
connected
with
my
happiness
i
accept
the
title
which
you
believe
to
be
conducive
to
the
glory
of
the
nation
i
submit
to
the
sanction
of
the
people
the
law
of
hereditary
succession
i
hope
that
france
will
never
repent
the
honours
she
may
confer
on
my
family
at
all
events
my
spirit
will
not
be
with
my
posterity
when
they
cease
to
merit
the
confidence
and
love
of
the
great
nation
cambaceres
next
went
to
congratulate
the
empress
and
then
was
realised
to
josephine
the
prediction
which
i
had
made
to
her
three
years
before
at
malmaison
in
the
original
motion
as
prepared
by
curee
the
imperial
dignity
was
to
be
declared
hereditary
in
the
family
of
napoleon
previous
to
being
formerly
read
before
the
tribunate
the
first
consul
sent
for
the
document
and
when
it
was
returned
it
was
found
that
the
word
family
was
altered
to
descendants
fabre
the
president
of
the
tribunate
who
received
the
altered
document
from
maret
seeing
the
effect
the
alteration
would
have
on
the
brothers
of
napoleon
and
finding
that
maret
affected
to
crest
the
change
as
immaterial
took
on
himself
to
restore
the
original
form
and
in
that
shape
it
was
read
by
the
unconscious
curee
to
the
tribunals
on
this
curious
passage
see
miot
de
melito
tome
ii
as
finally
settled
the
descent
of
the
crown
in
default
of
napoleon
children
was
limited
to
joseph
and
louis
and
their
descendants
but
the
power
of
adoption
was
given
to
napoleon
the
draft
of
the
was
heard
by
the
council
of
state
in
silence
and
napoleon
tried
in
vain
to
get
even
the
most
talkative
of
the
members
now
to
speak
the
senate
were
not
unanimous
in
rendering
the
the
three
votes
given
against
it
were
said
to
have
been
gregoire
the
former
constitutional
bishop
of
blois
carat
who
as
minister
of
justice
had
read
to
louis
xvi
the
sentence
of
death
and
lanjuinais
one
of
the
very
few
survivors
of
the
girondists
thiers
says
there
was
only
one
dissentient
voice
for
the
fury
of
the
brothers
of
napoleon
who
saw
the
destruction
of
all
their
ambitions
hopes
in
any
measure
for
the
descent
of
the
crown
except
in
the
family
see
miot
tome
ii
where
joseph
is
described
as
cursing
the
ambition
of
his
brother
and
desiring
his
death
as
a
benefit
for
france
and
his
family
bonaparte
first
act
as
emperor
on
the
very
day
of
his
elevation
to
the
imperial
throne
was
the
nomination
of
joseph
to
the
dignity
of
grand
elector
with
the
title
of
imperial
highness
louis
was
raised
to
the
dignity
of
constable
with
the
same
title
and
cambaceres
and
lebrun
were
created
and
of
the
empire
on
the
same
day
bonaparte
wrote
the
following
letter
to
cambaceres
the
first
which
he
signed
as
emperor
and
merely
with
the
name
of
napoleon
citizen
consul
cambaceres
your
title
has
changed
but
your
functions
and
my
confidence
remain
the
same
in
the
high
dignity
with
which
you
are
now
invested
you
will
continue
to
manifest
as
you
have
hitherto
done
in
that
of
consul
that
wisdom
and
that
distinguished
talent
which
entitle
you
to
so
important
a
share
in
all
the
good
which
i
may
have
effected
i
have
therefore
only
to
desire
the
continuance
of
the
sentiments
you
cherish
towards
the
state
and
me
given
at
the
palace
of
st
cloud
floreal
an
xii
may
signed
napoleon
by
the
emperor
maret
i
have
quoted
this
first
letter
of
the
emperor
because
it
is
characteristic
of
bonaparte
art
in
managing
transitions
it
was
to
the
citizen
consul
that
the
emperor
addressed
himself
and
it
was
dated
according
to
the
republican
calendar
that
calendar
together
with
the
delusive
inscription
on
the
coin
were
all
that
now
remained
of
the
republic
next
day
the
emperor
came
to
paris
to
hold
a
grand
levee
at
the
tuileries
for
he
was
not
the
man
to
postpone
the
gratification
that
vanity
derived
from
his
new
dignity
and
title
the
assembly
was
more
numerous
and
brilliant
than
on
any
former
occasion
bessieres
having
addressed
the
emperor
on
the
part
of
the
guards
the
emperor
replied
in
the
following
terms
i
know
the
sentiments
the
guards
cherish
towards
me
i
repose
perfect
confidence
in
their
courage
and
fidelity
i
constantly
see
with
renewed
pleasure
companions
in
arms
who
have
escaped
so
many
dangers
and
are
covered
with
so
many
honourable
wounds
i
experience
a
sentiment
of
satisfaction
when
i
look
at
the
guards
and
think
that
there
has
not
for
the
last
fifteen
years
in
any
of
the
four
quarters
of
the
world
been
a
battle
in
which
some
of
them
have
not
taken
part
on
the
same
day
all
the
generals
and
colonels
in
paris
were
presented
to
the
emperor
by
louis
bonaparte
who
had
already
begun
to
exercise
his
functions
of
constable
in
a
few
days
everything
assumed
a
new
aspect
but
in
spite
of
the
admiration
which
was
openly
expressed
the
parisians
secretly
ridiculed
the
new
courtiers
this
greatly
displeased
bonaparte
who
was
very
charitably
informed
of
it
in
order
to
check
his
prepossession
in
favour
of
the
men
of
the
old
court
such
as
the
comte
de
segur
and
at
a
later
period
comte
louis
de
narbonne
to
give
all
possible
solemnity
to
his
accession
napoleon
ordered
that
the
senate
itself
should
proclaim
in
paris
the
organic
which
entirely
changed
the
constitution
of
the
state
by
one
of
those
anomalies
which
i
have
frequently
had
occasion
to
remark
the
emperor
fixed
for
this
ceremony
sunday
the
floral
that
day
was
a
festival
in
all
paris
while
the
unfortunate
prisoners
were
languishing
in
the
dungeons
of
the
temple
on
the
day
after
bonaparte
accession
the
old
formulae
were
restored
the
emperor
determined
that
the
french
princes
and
princesses
should
receive
the
title
of
imperial
highness
that
his
sisters
should
take
the
same
title
that
the
grand
dignitaries
of
the
empire
should
be
called
serene
highnesses
that
the
princes
and
titularies
of
the
grand
dignitaries
should
be
addressed
by
the
title
of
monseigneur
that
maret
the
secretary
of
state
should
have
the
rank
of
minister
that
the
ministers
should
retain
the
title
of
excellency
to
which
should
be
added
that
of
monseigneur
in
the
petitions
addressed
to
them
and
that
the
title
of
excellency
should
be
given
to
the
president
of
the
senate
at
the
same
time
napoleon
appointed
the
first
marshals
of
the
empire
and
determined
that
they
should
be
called
monsieur
le
marechal
when
addressed
verbally
and
monseigneur
in
writing
the
following
are
the
names
of
these
sons
of
the
republic
transformed
into
props
of
the
empire
berthier
murat
moncey
jourdan
massena
augereau
bernadotte
soult
brune
lannes
mortier
ney
davoust
and
besaieres
the
title
of
marshal
of
the
empire
was
also
granted
to
the
generals
kellerman
lefebvre
perignon
and
serrurier
as
having
served
as
chief
the
reader
can
not
have
failed
to
observe
that
the
name
of
lucien
has
not
been
mentioned
among
the
individuals
of
bonaparte
family
on
whom
dignities
were
conferred
the
fact
is
the
two
brothers
were
no
longer
on
good
terms
with
each
other
not
as
it
has
been
alleged
because
lucien
wished
to
play
the
part
of
a
republican
but
because
he
would
not
submit
to
the
imperious
will
of
napoleon
in
a
circumstance
in
which
the
latter
counted
on
his
brother
docility
to
serve
the
interests
of
his
policy
in
the
conferences
which
preceded
the
great
change
in
the
form
of
government
it
was
not
lucien
but
joseph
who
probably
for
the
sake
of
sounding
opinion
affected
an
opposition
which
was
by
some
mistaken
for
republicanism
with
regard
to
lucien
as
he
had
really
rendered
great
services
to
napoleon
on
the
brumaire
at
st
cloud
and
as
he
himself
exaggerated
the
value
of
those
services
he
saw
no
reward
worthy
of
his
ambition
but
a
throne
independent
of
his
brother
it
is
certain
that
when
at
madrid
he
had
aspired
to
win
the
good
graces
of
a
spanish
infanta
and
on
that
subject
reports
were
circulated
with
which
i
have
nothing
to
do
because
i
never
had
any
opportunity
of
ascertaining
their
truth
all
i
know
is
that
lucien
first
wife
being
dead
bonaparte
wished
him
to
marry
a
german
princess
by
way
of
forming
the
first
great
alliance
in
the
family
lucien
however
refused
to
comply
with
napoleon
wishes
and
he
secretly
married
the
wife
of
an
agent
named
i
believe
joubertou
who
for
the
sake
of
convenience
was
sent
to
the
west
indies
where
he
died
shortly
after
when
bonaparte
heard
of
this
marriage
from
the
priest
by
whom
it
had
been
clandestinely
performed
he
fell
into
a
furious
passion
and
resolved
not
to
confer
on
lucien
the
title
of
french
prince
on
account
of
what
he
termed
his
unequal
match
lucien
therefore
obtained
no
other
dignity
than
that
of
senator
according
to
lucien
himself
napoleon
wished
him
to
marry
the
queen
of
etruria
daughter
of
charles
iv
of
spain
who
had
married
louie
de
bourbon
prince
of
parma
son
of
the
duke
of
parma
to
whom
napoleon
had
given
tuscany
in
as
the
kingdom
of
etruria
her
husband
had
died
in
may
and
she
governed
in
the
name
of
her
son
lucien
whose
first
wife
anne
christine
boyer
had
died
in
had
married
his
second
wife
alexandrine
laurence
de
bleschamps
who
had
married
but
who
had
divorced
a
jonberthon
when
lucien
had
been
ambassador
in
spain
in
charged
among
other
things
with
obtaining
elba
the
queen
he
says
wished
napoleon
should
marry
an
infanta
donna
isabella
her
youngest
daughter
afterwards
queen
of
naples
an
overture
to
which
napoleon
seems
not
to
have
made
any
answer
as
for
lucien
he
objected
to
his
brother
that
the
queen
was
ugly
and
laughed
at
napoleon
representations
as
to
her
being
propre
but
at
last
he
acknowledged
his
marriage
with
madame
jouberthon
this
made
a
complete
break
between
the
brothers
and
on
hearing
of
the
execution
of
the
due
lucien
said
to
his
wife
alexandrine
let
us
go
he
has
tasted
blood
he
went
to
italy
and
in
tried
to
go
to
the
united
states
taken
prisoner
by
the
english
he
was
detained
first
at
malta
and
then
in
england
at
ludlow
castle
and
at
thorngrove
till
when
he
went
to
rome
the
pope
who
ever
showed
a
kindly
feeling
towards
the
bonapartes
made
the
brutus
bonaparte
prince
de
canino
and
due
de
musignano
in
he
joined
napoleon
and
on
the
final
fall
of
the
empire
he
was
interned
at
rome
till
the
death
of
his
brother
jerome
who
pursued
an
opposite
line
of
conduct
was
afterwards
made
a
king
as
to
lucien
republicanism
it
did
not
survive
the
brumaire
and
he
was
always
a
warm
partisan
of
hereditary
succession
but
i
pass
on
to
relate
what
i
know
respecting
the
almost
incredible
influence
which
on
the
foundation
of
the
empire
bonaparte
exercised
over
the
powers
which
did
not
yet
dare
to
declare
war
against
him
i
studied
bonaparte
policy
closely
and
i
came
to
this
conclusion
on
the
subject
that
he
was
governed
by
ambition
by
the
passion
of
dominion
and
that
no
relations
on
a
footing
of
equality
between
himself
and
any
other
power
could
be
of
long
duration
the
other
states
of
europe
had
only
to
choose
one
of
two
things
submission
or
war
as
to
secondary
states
they
might
thenceforth
be
considered
as
fiefs
of
the
french
government
and
as
they
could
not
resist
bonaparte
easily
accustomed
them
to
bend
to
his
yoke
can
there
be
a
stronger
proof
of
this
arbitrary
influence
than
what
occurred
at
carlsruhe
after
the
violation
of
the
territory
of
baden
by
the
arrest
of
the
due
far
from
venturing
to
make
any
observation
on
that
violation
so
contrary
to
the
rights
of
nations
the
grand
duke
of
baden
was
obliged
to
publish
in
his
own
state
a
decree
evidently
dictated
by
bonaparte
the
decree
stated
that
many
individuals
formerly
belonging
to
the
army
of
conde
having
come
to
the
neighbourhood
of
carlsruhe
his
electoral
highness
had
felt
it
his
duty
to
direct
that
no
individual
coming
from
conde
army
nor
indeed
any
french
emigrant
should
unless
he
had
permission
previously
to
the
place
make
a
longer
sojourn
than
was
allowed
to
foreign
travellers
such
was
already
the
influence
which
bonaparte
exercised
over
germany
whose
princes
to
use
an
expression
which
he
employed
in
a
later
decree
were
crushed
by
the
grand
measures
of
the
empire
but
to
be
just
without
however
justifying
bonaparte
i
must
acknowledge
that
the
intrigues
which
england
fomented
in
all
parts
of
the
continent
were
calculated
to
excite
his
natural
irritability
to
the
utmost
degree
the
agents
of
england
were
spread
over
the
whole
of
europe
and
they
varied
the
rumours
which
they
were
commissioned
to
circulate
according
to
the
chances
of
credit
which
the
different
places
afforded
their
reports
were
generally
false
but
credulity
gave
ear
to
them
and
speculators
endeavoured
each
according
to
his
interest
to
give
them
support
the
headquarters
of
all
this
plotting
was
munich
where
drake
who
was
sent
from
england
had
the
supreme
direction
his
correspondence
which
was
seized
by
the
french
government
was
at
first
placed
amongst
the
documents
to
be
produced
on
the
trial
of
georges
moreau
and
the
other
prisoners
but
in
the
course
of
the
preliminary
proceedings
the
grand
judge
received
directions
to
detach
them
and
make
them
the
subject
of
a
special
report
to
the
first
consul
in
order
that
their
publication
beforehand
might
influence
public
opinion
and
render
it
unfavourable
to
those
who
were
doomed
to
be
sacrificed
the
instructions
given
by
drake
to
his
agents
render
it
impossible
to
doubt
that
england
wished
to
overthrow
the
government
of
bonaparte
drake
wrote
as
follows
to
a
man
who
was
appointed
to
travel
through
france
the
principal
object
of
your
journey
being
the
overthrow
of
the
existing
government
one
of
the
means
of
effecting
it
is
to
acquire
a
knowledge
of
the
enemy
plans
for
this
purpose
it
is
of
the
highest
importance
to
begin
in
the
first
place
by
establishing
communications
with
persons
who
may
be
depended
upon
in
the
different
government
offices
in
order
to
obtain
exact
information
of
all
plans
with
respect
to
foreign
or
internal
affairs
the
knowledge
of
these
plans
will
supply
the
best
means
of
defeating
them
and
failure
is
the
way
to
bring
the
government
into
complete
discredit
the
first
and
most
important
step
towards
the
end
proposed
try
to
gain
over
trustworthy
agents
in
the
different
government
departments
endeavour
also
to
learn
what
passes
in
the
secret
committee
which
is
supposed
to
be
established
at
st
cloud
and
composed
of
the
friends
of
the
first
consul
be
careful
to
furnish
information
of
the
various
projects
which
bonaparte
may
entertain
relative
to
turkey
and
ireland
likewise
send
intelligence
respecting
the
movements
of
troops
respecting
vessels
and
and
all
military
preparations
drake
in
his
instructions
also
recommended
that
the
subversion
of
bonaparte
government
should
for
the
time
be
the
only
object
in
view
and
that
nothing
should
be
said
about
the
king
intentions
until
certain
information
could
be
obtained
respecting
his
views
but
most
of
his
letters
and
instructions
were
anterior
to
the
whole
bearing
of
the
seized
documents
proved
what
bonaparte
could
not
be
ignorant
of
namely
that
england
was
his
constant
enemy
but
after
examining
them
i
was
of
opinion
that
they
contained
nothing
which
could
justify
the
belief
that
the
government
of
great
britain
authorised
any
attempt
at
assassination
when
the
first
consul
received
the
report
of
the
grand
judge
relative
to
drake
plots
against
his
government
he
transmitted
a
copy
of
it
to
the
senate
and
it
was
in
reply
to
this
communication
that
the
senate
made
those
first
overtures
which
bonaparte
thought
vague
but
which
nevertheless
led
to
the
formation
of
the
empire
notwithstanding
this
important
circumstance
i
have
not
hitherto
mentioned
drake
because
his
intrigues
for
appeared
to
me
to
be
more
immediately
connected
with
the
preliminaries
of
the
trial
of
georges
and
moreau
which
i
shall
notice
in
my
next
chapter
these
were
not
plots
for
assassination
bonaparte
in
the
same
way
had
his
secret
agents
in
every
country
of
europe
without
excepting
england
alison
chap
xxxvii
par
says
on
this
matter
of
drake
that
though
the
english
agents
were
certainly
attempting
a
they
had
no
idea
of
encouraging
the
assassination
of
napoleon
while
england
was
no
match
for
the
french
police
agents
in
a
transaction
of
this
description
for
the
publication
of
regular
revealed
the
mortifying
fact
that
the
whole
correspondence
both
of
drake
and
spencer
smith
had
been
regularly
transmitted
as
fast
as
it
took
place
to
the
police
of
paris
and
that
their
principal
corresponded
in
that
city
mehu
de
la
tonche
was
himself
an
agent
of
the
police
employed
to
tempt
the
british
envoys
into
this
perilous
enterprise
at
the
same
time
that
bonaparte
communicated
to
the
senate
the
report
of
the
grand
judge
the
minister
for
foreign
affairs
addressed
the
following
circular
letter
to
the
members
of
the
diplomatic
body
the
first
consul
has
commanded
me
to
forward
to
your
excellency
a
copy
of
a
report
which
has
been
presented
to
him
respecting
a
conspiracy
formed
in
france
by
drake
his
britannic
minister
at
the
court
of
munich
which
by
its
object
as
well
as
its
date
is
evidently
connected
with
the
infamous
plot
now
in
the
course
of
investigation
the
printed
copy
of
drake
letters
and
authentic
documents
is
annexed
to
the
report
the
originals
will
be
immediately
sent
by
order
of
the
first
consul
to
the
elector
of
bavaria
such
a
prostitution
of
the
most
honourable
function
which
can
be
intrusted
to
a
man
is
unexampled
in
the
history
of
civilised
nations
it
will
astonish
and
afflict
europe
as
an
unheard
of
crime
which
hitherto
the
most
perverse
governments
have
not
dared
to
meditate
the
first
consul
is
too
well
acquainted
with
sentiments
of
the
diplomatic
body
accredited
to
him
not
to
be
fully
convinced
that
every
one
of
its
members
will
behold
with
profound
regret
the
profanation
of
the
sacred
character
of
ambassador
basely
transformed
into
a
minister
of
plots
snares
and
corruption
all
the
ambassadors
ministers
plenipotentiaries
envoys
ordinary
or
extraordinary
whatever
might
be
their
denomination
addressed
answers
to
the
minister
for
foreign
affairs
in
which
they
expressed
horror
and
indignation
at
the
conduct
of
england
and
drake
machinations
these
answers
were
returned
only
five
days
after
the
duc
death
and
here
one

by
that
numerous

who
lent
implicit

public
interest
mm

and
above

the
name
of
moreau
towered
above
all
the
rest
and
with
respect
to
him
the
government
found
itself
not
a
little
perplexed
it
was
necessary
on
the
one
hand
to
surround
him
with
a
guard
sufficiently
imposing
to
repress
the
eagerness
of
the
people
and
of
his
friends
and
yet
on
the
other
hand
care
was
required
that
this
guard
should
not
be
so
strong
as
to
admit
of
the
possibility
of
making
it
a
should
the
voice
of
a
chief
so
honoured
by
the
army
appeal
to
it
for
defence
a
rising
of
the
populace
in
favour
of
moreau
was
considered
as
a
very
possible
event
some
hoped
for
it
others
dreaded
it
when
i
reflect
on
the
state
of
feeling
which
then
prevailed
i
am
certain
that
a
movement
in
his
favour
would
infallibly
have
taken
place
had
judges
more
complying
than
even
those
who
presided
at
the
trial
condemned
moreau
to
capital
punishment
it
is
impossible
to
form
an
idea
of
the
crowd
that
choked
up
the
avenues
of
the
palace
of
justice
on
the
day
the
trials
commenced
this
crowd
continued
during
the
twelve
days
the
proceedings
lasted
and
was
exceedingly
great
on
the
day
the
sentence
was
pronounced
persons
of
the
highest
class
were
anxious
to
be
present
i
was
one
of
the
first
in
the
hall
being
determined
to
watch
the
course
of
these
solemn
proceedings
the
court
being
assembled
the
president
ordered
the
prisoners
to
be
brought
in
they
entered
in
a
file
and
ranged
themselves
on
the
benches
each
between
two
gendarmes
they
appeared
composed
and
collected
and
resignation
was
depicted
on
the
countenances
of
all
except
bouvet
de
lozier
who
did
not
dare
to
raise
his
eyes
to
his
companions
in
misfortune
whom
his
weakness
rather
than
his
will
had
betrayed
i
did
not
recognise
him
until
the
president
proceeded
to
call
over
the
prisoners
and
to
put
the
usual
questions
respecting
their
names
professions
and
places
of
abode
of
the
nine
prisoners
among
whom
were
several
females
only
two
were
personally
known
to
me
namely
moreau
whose
presence
on
the
prisoner
bench
seemed
to
wring
every
heart
and
georges
whom
i
had
seen
at
the
tuileries
in
the
first
consul
cabinet
the
first
sitting
of
the
court
was
occupied
with
the
reading
of
the
act
of
accusation
or
indictment
and
the
voices
of
the
ushers
commanding
silence
could
scarce
suppress
the
buzz
which
pervaded
the
court
at
the
mention
of
moreau
name
all
eyes
were
turned
towards
the
conqueror
of
hohenlinden
and
while
the
procureur
imperial
read
over
the
long
indictment
and
invoked
the
vengeance
of
the
law
on
an
attempt
against
the
head
of
the
republic
it
was
easy
to
perceive
how
he
tortured
his
ingenuity
to
fasten
apparent
guilt
on
the
laurels
of
moreau
the
good
sense
of
the
public
discerned
proofs
of
his
innocence
in
the
very
circumstances
brought
forward
against
him
i
shall
never
forget
the
effect
produced
so
contrary
to
what
was
anticipated
by
the
prosecutors
by
the
reading
of
a
letter
addressed
by
moreau
from
his
prison
in
the
temple
to
the
first
consul
when
the
judges
appointed
to
interrogate
him
sought
to
make
his
past
conduct
the
subject
of
accusation
on
account
of
de
klinglin
papers
having
fallen
into
his
hands
he
was
reproached
with
having
too
long
delayed
transmitting
these
documents
to
the
directory
and
it
was
curious
to
see
the
emperor
napoleon
become
the
avenger
of
pretended
offences
committed
against
the
directory
which
he
had
overthrown
in
the
letter
here
alluded
to
moreau
said
to
bonaparte
then
first
consul
in
the
short
campaign
of
the
year
from
the
to
the
of
march
we
took
the
papers
belonging
to
the
staff
of
the
army
and
a
number
of
documents
were
brought
to
me
which
general
desaix
then
wounded
amused
himself
by
perusing
it
appeared
from
this
correspondence
that
general
pichegru
had
maintained
communications
with
the
french
princes
this
discovery
was
very
painful
and
particularly
to
me
and
we
agreed
to
say
nothing
of
the
matter
pichegru
as
a
member
of
the
legislative
body
could
do
but
little
to
injure
the
public
cause
since
peace
was
established
i
nevertheless
took
every
precaution
for
protecting
the
army
against
the
ill
effects
of
a
system
of
espionage
the
events
of
the
fructidor
occasioned
so
much
anxiety
that
two
officers
who
knew
of
the
existence
of
the
correspondence
prevailed
on
me
to
communicate
it
to
the
government
i
felt
that
as
a
public
functionary
i
could
no
longer
remain
silent
during
the
two
last
campaigns
in
germany
and
since
the
peace
distant
overtures
have
been
made
to
me
with
the
view
of
drawing
me
into
connection
with
the
french
princes
this
appeared
so
absurd
that
i
took
no
notice
of
these
overtures
as
to
the
present
conspiracy
i
can
assure
you
i
have
been
far
from
taking
any
share
in
it
i
repeat
to
you
general
that
whatever
proposition
to
that
effect
was
made
me
i
rejected
it
and
regarded
it
as
the
height
of
madness
when
it
was
represented
to
me
that
the
invasion
of
england
would
offer
a
favourable
opportunity
for
effecting
a
change
in
the
french
government
i
invariably
answered
that
the
senate
was
the
authority
to
which
the
whole
of
france
would
naturally
cling
in
the
time
of
trouble
and
that
i
would
be
the
first
to
place
myself
under
its
orders
to
such
overtures
made
to
a
private
individual
who
wished
to
preserve
no
connection
either
with
the
army
of
whom
tenths
have
served
under
me
or
any
constituted
authority
the
only
possible
answer
was
a
refusal
betrayal
of
confidence
i
disdained
such
a
step
which
is
always
base
becomes
doubly
odious
when
the
treachery
is
committed
against
those
to
whom
we
owe
gratitude
or
have
been
bound
by
old
friendship
this
general
is
all
i
have
to
tell
you
respecting
my
relations
with
pichegru
and
it
must
convince
you
that
very
false
and
hasty
inferences
have
been
drawn
from
conduct
which
though
perhaps
imprudent
was
far
from
being
criminal
moreau
fulfilled
his
duty
as
a
public
functionary
by
communicating
to
the
directory
the
papers
which
unfolded
a
plot
against
the
government
and
which
the
chances
of
war
had
thrown
into
his
hands
he
fulfilled
his
duty
as
a
man
of
honour
by
not
voluntarily
incurring
the
infamy
which
can
never
be
wiped
from
the
character
of
an
informer
bonaparte
in
situation
would
have
acted
the
same
part
for
i
never
knew
a
man
express
stronger
indignation
than
himself
against
informers
until
be
began
to
consider
everything
a
virtue
which
served
his
ambition
and
everything
a
crime
which
opposed
it
the
two
facts
which
most
forcibly
obtruded
themselves
on
my
attention
during
the
trial
were
the
inveterate
violence
of
the
president
of
the
court
towards
the
prisoners
and
the
innocence
of
moreau
it
is
strange
that
bourrienne
does
not
acknowledge
that
he
was
charged
by
napoleon
with
the
duty
of
attending
this
trial
of
moreau
and
of
sending
in
a
daily
report
of
the
proceedings
but
in
spite
of
the
most
insidious
examinations
which
can
be
conceived
moreau
never
once
fell
into
the
least
contradiction
if
my
memory
fail
me
not
it
was
on
the
fourth
day
that
he
was
examined
by
thuriot
one
of
the
judges
the
result
clear
as
day
to
all
present
was
that
moreau
was
a
total
stranger
to
all
the
plots
all
the
intrigues
which
had
been
set
on
foot
in
london
in
fact
during
the
whole
course
of
the
trial
to
which
i
listened
with
as
much
attention
as
interest
i
did
not
discover
the
shadow
of
a
circumstance
which
could
in
the
least
commit
him
or
which
had
the
least
reference
to
him
scarcely
one
of
the
hundred
and
witnesses
who
were
heard
for
the
prosecution
knew
him
and
he
himself
declared
on
the
fourth
sitting
which
took
place
on
the
of
may
that
there
was
not
an
individual
among
the
accused
whom
he
knew
not
one
whom
he
had
ever
seen
in
the
course
of
the
long
proceedings
notwithstanding
the
manifest
efforts
of
thuriot
to
extort
false
admissions
and
force
contradictions
no
fact
of
any
consequence
was
elicited
to
the
prejudice
of
moreau
his
appearance
was
as
calm
as
his
conscience
and
as
he
sat
on
the
bench
he
had
the
appearance
of
one
led
by
curiosity
to
be
present
at
this
interesting
trial
rather
than
of
an
accused
person
to
whom
the
proceedings
might
end
in
condemnation
and
death
but
for
the
fall
of
moreau
in
the
ranks
of
the
enemy
but
for
the
foreign
cockade
which
disgraced
the
cap
of
the
conqueror
of
hohenlinden
his
complete
innocence
would
long
since
have
been
put
beyond
doubt
and
it
would
have
been
acknowledged
that
the
most
infamous
machinations
were
employed
for
his
destruction
it
is
evident
that
lajolais
who
had
passed
from
london
to
paris
and
from
paris
to
london
had
been
acting
the
part
of
an
intriguer
rather
than
of
a
conspirator
and
that
the
object
of
his
missions
was
not
so
much
to
reconcile
moreau
and
pichegru
as
to
make
pichegru
the
instrument
of
implicating
moreau
those
who
supposed
lajolais
to
be
in
the
pay
of
the
british
government
were
egregiously
imposed
on
lajolais
was
only
in
the
pay
of
the
secret
police
he
was
condemned
to
death
as
was
expected
but
he
received
his
pardon
as
was
agreed
upon
here
was
one
of
the
disclosures
which
pichegru
might
have
made
hence
the
necessity
of
getting
him
out
of
the
way
before
the
trial
as
to
the
evidence
of
the
man
named
rolland
it
was
clear
to
everybody
that
moreau
was
right
when
he
said
to
the
president
in
my
opinion
rolland
is
either
a
creature
of
the
police
or
he
has
given
his
evidence
under
the
influence
of
fear
rolland
made
two
declarations
the
first
contained
nothing
at
all
the
second
was
in
answer
to
the
following
observations
you
see
you
stand
in
a
terrible
situation
you
must
either
be
held
to
be
an
accomplice
in
the
conspiracy
or
you
must
be
taken
as
evidence
if
you
say
nothing
you
will
be
considered
in
the
light
of
an
accomplice
if
you
confess
you
will
be
saved
this
single
circumstance
may
serve
to
give
an
idea
of
the
way
the
trials
were
conducted
so
as
to
criminate
moreau
on
his
part
the
general
repelled
the
attacks
of
which
he
was
the
object
with
calm
composure
and
modest
confidence
though
flashes
of
just
indignation
would
occasionally
burst
from
him
i
recollect
the
effect
he
produced
upon
the
court
and
the
auditors
at
one
of
the
sittings
when
the
president
had
accused
him
of
the
design
of
making
himself
dictator
he
exclaimed
i
dictator
what
make
myself
dictator
at
the
head
of
the
partisans
of
the
bourbons
point
out
my
partisans
my
partisans
would
naturally
be
the
soldiers
of
france
of
whom
i
have
commanded
and
saved
more
than
fifty
thousand
these
are
the
partisans
i
should
look
to
all
my
aides
de
camp
all
the
officers
of
my
acquaintance
have
been
arrested
not
the
shadow
of
a
suspicion
could
be
found
against
any
of
them
and
they
have
been
set
at
liberty
why
then
attribute
to
me
the
madness
of
aiming
to
get
myself
made
dictator
by
the
aid
of
the
adherents
of
the
old
french
princes
of
persons
who
have
fought
in
their
cause
since
you
allege
that
these
men
in
the
space
of
hours
formed
the
project
of
raising
me
to
the
dictatorship
it
is
madness
to
think
of
it
my
fortune
and
my
pay
have
been
alluded
to
i
began
the
world
with
nothing
i
might
have
had
by
this
time
fifty
millions
i
have
merely
a
house
and
a
bit
of
ground
as
to
my
pay
it
is
forty
thousand
francs
surely
that
sum
will
not
be
compared
with
my
services
during
the
trial
moreau
delivered
a
defence
which
i
knew
had
been
written
by
his
friend
garat
whose
eloquence
i
well
remember
was
always
disliked
by
bonaparte
of
this
i
had
a
proof
on
the
occasion
of
a
grand
ceremony
which
took
place
in
the
place
des
victoires
on
laying
the
first
stone
of
a
monument
which
was
to
have
been
erected
to
the
memory
of
desaix
but
which
was
never
executed
the
first
consul
returned
home
in
very
and
said
to
me
bourrienne
what
a
brute
that
garat
is
what
a
stringer
of
words
i
have
been
obliged
to
listen
to
him
for
of
an
hour
there
are
people
who
never
know
when
to
hold
their
tongues
whatever
might
be
the
character
of
garat
eloquence
or
opinion
of
it
his
conduct
was
noble
on
the
occasion
of
moreau
trial
for
he
might
be
sure
bonaparte
would
bear
him
a
grudge
for
lending
the
aid
of
his
pen
to
the
only
man
whose
military
glory
though
not
equal
to
that
of
the
first
consul
might
entitle
him
to
be
looked
upon
as
his
rival
in
fame
at
one
of
the
sittings
a
circumstance
occurred
which
produced
an
almost
electrical
effect
i
think
i
still
see
general
lecourbe
the
worthy
friend
of
moreau
entering
unexpectedly
into
the
court
leading
a
little
boy
raising
the
child
in
his
arms
he
exclaimed
aloud
and
with
considerable
emotion
soldiers
behold
the
son
of
your
general
this
action
of
lecourbe
together
with
the
part
played
in
this
trial
by
his
brother
one
of
the
judges
was
most
unfortunate
not
only
for
lecourbe
but
for
france
which
consequently
lost
the
services
of
its
best
general
of
mountain
warfare
his
campaigns
of
switzerland
in
on
the
gothard
against
suwarrow
are
well
known
naturally
disgraced
for
the
part
he
took
with
moreau
he
was
not
again
employed
till
the
cent
jours
when
he
did
good
service
although
he
had
disapproved
of
the
defection
of
ney
from
the
royalist
cause
he
died
in
his
brother
the
judge
had
a
most
furious
reception
from
napoleon
who
called
him
a
prevaricating
judge
and
dismissed
him
from
his
office
remusat
tome
ii
p
at
this
unexpected
movement
all
the
military
present
spontaneously
rose
and
presented
arms
while
a
murmur
of
approbation
from
the
spectators
applauded
the
act
it
is
certain
that
had
moreau
at
that
moment
said
but
one
word
such
was
the
enthusiasm
in
his
favour
the
tribunal
would
have
been
broken
up
and
the
prisoners
liberated
moreau
however
was
silent
and
indeed
appeared
the
only
unconcerned
person
in
court
throughout
the
whole
course
of
the
trial
moreau
inspired
so
much
respect
that
when
he
was
asked
a
question
and
rose
to
reply
the
gendarmes
appointed
to
guard
him
rose
at
the
same
time
and
stood
uncovered
while
he
spoke
georges
was
far
from
exciting
the
interest
inspired
by
moreau
he
was
an
object
of
curiosity
rather
than
of
interest
the
difference
of
their
previous
conduct
was
in
itself
sufficient
to
occasion
a
great
contrast
in
their
situation
before
the
court
moreau
was
full
of
confidence
and
georges
full
of
resignation
the
latter
regarded
his
fate
with
a
fierce
kind
of
resolution
he
occasionally
resumed
the
caustic
tone
which
he
seemed
to
have
renounced
when
he
harangued
his
associates
before
their
departure
from
the
temple
with
the
most
sarcastic
bitterness
he
alluded
to
the
name
and
vote
of
thuriot
one
of
the
most
violent
of
the
judges
often
terming
him
thuriot
and
the
president
hemart
both
voted
for
the
death
of
the
king
merlin
the
imperial
was
one
of
the
bourrienne
and
after
pronouncing
his
name
or
being
forced
to
reply
to
his
interrogatories
he
would
ask
for
a
glass
of
brandy
to
wash
his
mouth
georges
had
the
manners
and
bearing
of
a
rude
soldier
but
under
his
coarse
exterior
he
concealed
the
soul
of
a
hero
when
the
witnesses
of
his
arrest
had
answered
the
questions
of
the
president
hemart
this
judge
turned
towards
the
accused
and
inquired
whether
he
had
anything
to
say
in
no
do
you
admit
the
facts
yes
here
georges
busied
himself
in
looking
over
the
papers
which
lay
before
him
when
hemart
warned
him
to
desist
and
attend
to
the
questions
the
following
dialogue
then
commenced
do
you
confess
having
been
arrested
in
the
place
designated
by
the
witness
i
do
not
know
the
name
of
the
place
do
you
confess
having
been
arrested
yes
did
you
twice
fire
a
pistol
yes
did
you
kill
a
man
indeed
i
do
not
know
had
you
a
poniard
yes
and
two
pistols
yes
who
was
in
company
with
you
i
do
not
know
the
person
where
did
you
lodge
in
paris
nowhere
at
the
time
of
your
arrest
did
you
not
reside
in
the
house
of
a
fruiterer
in
the
rue
de
la
montagne
st
genevieve
at
the
time
of
my
arrest
i
was
in
a
cabriolet
i
lodged
nowhere
where
did
you
sleep
on
the
evening
of
your
arrest
nowhere
what
were
you
doing
in
paris
i
was
walking
about
whom
have
you
seen
in
paris
i
shall
name
no
one
i
know
no
one
from
this
short
specimen
of
the
manner
in
which
georges
replied
to
the
questions
of
the
president
we
may
judge
of
his
unshaken
firmness
during
the
proceedings
in
all
that
concerned
himself
he
was
perfectly
open
but
in
regard
to
whatever
tended
to
endanger
his
associates
he
maintained
the
most
obstinate
silence
notwithstanding
every
attempt
to
overcome
his
firmness
that
i
was
not
the
only
one
who
justly
appreciated
the
noble
character
of
georges
is
rendered
evident
by
the
following
circumstance
having
accompanied
carbonnet
to
the
police
where
he
went
to
demand
his
papers
on
the
day
of
his
removal
to
pelagic
we
were
obliged
to
await
the
return
of
real
who
was
absent
desmarets
and
several
other
persons
were
also
in
attendance
real
had
been
at
the
conciergerie
where
he
had
seen
georges
cadoudal
and
on
his
entrance
observed
to
desmarets
and
the
others
sufficiently
loud
to
be
distinctly
heard
by
carbonnet
and
myself
i
have
had
an
interview
with
georges
who
is
an
extraordinary
man
i
told
him
that
i
was
disposed
to
offer
him
a
pardon
if
he
would
promise
to
renounce
the
conspiracy
and
accept
of
employment
under
government
but
to
my
arguments
and
persuasions
he
only
replied
comrades
followed
me
to
france
and
i
shall
fellow
them
to
death
in
this
he
kept
his
word
were
we
to
judge
these
memorable
proceedings
from
the
official
documents
published
in
the
moniteur
and
other
journals
of
that
period
we
should
form
a
very
erroneous
opinion
those
falsities
were
even
the
object
of
a
very
serious
complaint
on
the
part
of
cosier
victor
one
of
the
accused
after
the
speech
of
gauthier
the
advocate
of
coster
victor
the
president
inquired
of
the
accused
whether
he
had
anything
further
to
say
in
his
defence
to
which
he
replied
i
have
only
to
add
that
the
witnesses
necessary
to
my
exculpation
have
not
yet
appeared
i
must
besides
express
my
surprise
at
the
means
which
have
been
employed
to
lead
astray
public
opinion
and
to
load
with
infamy
not
only
the
accused
but
also
their
intrepid
defenders
i
have
read
with
pain
in
the
journals
of
that
the
proceedings
here
the
president
interrupting
observed
that
these
were
circumstances
foreign
to
the
case
not
in
the
least
replied
cosier
victor
on
the
contrary
they
bear
very
materially
on
the
cause
since
mangling
and
misrepresenting
our
defence
is
a
practice
assuredly
calculated
to
ruin
us
in
the
estimation
of
the
public
in
the
journals
of
the
speech
of
gauthier
is
shamefully
garbled
and
i
should
be
deficient
in
gratitude
were
i
not
here
to
bear
testimony
to
the
zeal
and
courage
which
he
has
displayed
in
my
defence
i
protest
against
the
puerilities
and
absurdities
which
have
been
put
into
his
mouth
and
i
entreat
him
not
to
relax
in
his
generous
efforts
it
is
not
on
his
account
that
i
make
this
observation
he
does
not
require
it
at
my
hands
it
is
for
it
is
for
the
accused
whom
such
arts
tend
to
injure
in
the
estimation
of
the
public
coster
victor
had
something
chivalrous
in
his
language
and
manners
which
spoke
greatly
in
his
favour
he
conveyed
no
bad
idea
of
one
of
the
fiesco
conspirators
or
of
those
leaders
of
the
fronds
who
intermingled
gallantry
with
their
politics
an
anecdote
to
this
effect
was
current
about
the
period
of
the
trial
coster
victor
it
is
related
being
unable
any
longer
to
find
a
secure
asylum
in
paris
sought
refuge
for
a
single
night
in
the
house
of
a
beautiful
actress
formerly
in
the
good
graces
of
the
first
consul
and
it
is
added
that
bonaparte
on
the
same
night
having
secretly
arrived
on
a
visit
to
the
lady
found
himself
unexpectedly
in
the
presence
of
coster
victor
who
might
have
taken
his
life
but
that
only
an
interchange
of
courtesy
took
place
betwixt
the
rival
gallants
this
ridiculous
story
was
doubtless
intended
to
throw
additional
odium
on
the
first
consul
if
cosier
victor
should
be
condemned
and
not
obtain
a
pardon
in
which
case
malignity
would
not
fail
to
attribute
his
execution
to
the
vengeance
of
a
jealous
lover
i
should
blush
to
relate
such
stories
equally
destitute
of
probability
and
truth
had
they
not
obtained
some
credit
at
the
time
whilst
i
was
with
bonaparte
he
never
went
abroad
during
the
night
and
it
was
not
surely
at
a
moment
when
the
saying
of
fouche
the
air
is
full
of
poniards
was
fully
explained
that
he
would
have
risked
such
nocturnal
adventures
wright
was
heard
in
the
sixth
sitting
on
the
of
june
as
the
hundred
and
witness
in
support
of
the
prosecution
he
however
refused
to
answer
any
interrogatories
put
to
him
declaring
that
as
a
prisoner
of
war
he
considered
himself
only
amenable
to
his
own
government
the
requested
the
president
to
order
the
examinations
of
captain
wright
on
the
of
may
and
at
a
later
period
to
be
read
over
to
him
which
being
done
the
witness
replied
that
it
was
omitted
to
be
stated
that
on
these
occasions
the
questions
had
been
accompanied
with
the
threat
of
transferring
him
to
a
military
tribunal
in
order
to
be
shot
if
he
did
not
betray
the
secrets
of
his
country
in
the
course
of
the
trial
the
most
lively
interest
was
felt
for
mm
de
polignac
the
eldest
of
the
polignacs
armand
condemned
to
death
had
that
penalty
remitted
but
was
imprisoned
in
ham
till
permitted
to
escape
m
he
became
duc
de
richelieu
in
his
younger
brother
jules
was
also
imprisoned
and
escaped
in
he
was
one
of
the
first
to
display
the
white
flag
in
paris
in
he
became
minister
of
charles
and
was
responsible
for
the
ordinances
which
oust
his
master
his
throne
in
imprisoned
nominally
for
life
he
was
released
in
and
after
passing
some
time
in
england
returned
to
france
the
remission
of
the
sentence
of
death
on
prince
armand
was
obtained
by
the
empress
josephine
time
after
time
urged
on
by
madame
de
remusat
she
implored
mercy
from
napoleon
who
at
last
consented
to
see
the
wife
of
the
prince
unlike
the
bourbon
louis
who
could
see
madame
de
lavalette
only
to
refuse
the
wretched
prayer
for
her
husband
for
napoleon
to
grant
the
interview
was
to
concede
the
pardon
the
prince
escaped
death
and
his
wife
who
had
obtained
the
interview
by
applying
to
madame
de
remusat
when
she
met
her
benefactress
in
the
times
of
the
restoration
displayed
a
really
grand
forgetfulness
of
what
had
passed
see
remusat
tome
ii
chap
charles
and
de
riviere
so
short
a
period
had
elapsed
since
the
proscription
of
the
nobility
that
independently
of
every
feeling
of
humanity
it
was
certainly
impolitic
to
exhibit
before
the
public
the
heirs
of
an
illustrious
name
endowed
with
that
devoted
heroism
which
could
not
fail
to
extort
admiration
even
from
those
who
condemned
their
opinions
and
principles
the
prisoners
were
all
young
and
their
situation
create
universal
sympathy
the
greatest
number
of
them
disdained
to
have
recourse
to
a
denial
and
seemed
less
anxious
for
the
preservation
of
their
own
lives
than
for
the
honour
of
the
cause
in
which
they
had
embarked
not
with
the
view
of
assassination
as
had
been
demonstrated
but
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
the
true
state
of
the
public
feeling
which
had
been
represented
by
some
factious
intriguers
as
favourable
to
the
bourbons
even
when
the
sword
of
the
law
was
suspended
over
their
heads
the
faithful
adherents
of
the
bourbons
displayed
on
every
occasion
their
attachment
and
fidelity
to
the
royal
cause
i
recollect
that
the
court
was
dissolved
in
tears
when
the
president
adduced
as
a
proof
of
the
guilt
of
de
riviere
his
having
worn
a
medal
of
the
comte
which
the
prisoner
requested
to
examine
and
on
its
being
handed
to
him
by
an
officer
de
riviere
pressed
it
to
his
lips
and
his
heart
then
returning
it
he
said
that
he
only
wished
to
render
homage
to
the
prince
whom
he
loved
the
court
was
still
more
deeply
affected
on
witnessing
the
generous
fraternal
struggle
which
took
place
during
the
last
sitting
between
the
two
de
polignacs
the
emotion
was
general
when
the
eldest
of
the
brothers
after
having
observed
that
his
always
going
out
alone
and
during
the
day
did
not
look
like
a
conspirator
anxious
for
concealment
added
these
remarkable
words
which
will
remain
indelibly
engraven
on
my
memory
i
have
now
only
one
wish
which
is
that
as
the
sword
is
suspended
over
our
heads
and
threatens
to
cut
short
the
existence
of
several
of
the
accused
you
would
in
consideration
of
his
youth
if
not
of
his
innocence
spare
my
brother
and
shower
down
upon
me
the
whole
weight
of
your
vengeance
it
was
during
the
last
sitting
but
one
on
friday
the
of
june
that
armand
de
polignac
made
the
above
affecting
appeal
in
favour
of
his
brother
the
following
day
before
the
fatal
sentence
was
pronounced
jules
de
polignac
addressed
the
judges
saying
i
was
so
deeply
affected
yesterday
while
my
brother
was
speaking
as
not
fully
to
have
attended
to
what
i
read
in
my
own
defence
but
being
now
perfectly
tranquil
i
entreat
gentlemen
that
you
will
not
regard
what
he
urged
in
my
behalf
i
repeat
on
the
contrary
and
with
most
justice
if
one
of
us
must
fall
a
sacrifice
if
there
be
yet
time
save
him
restore
him
to
the
tears
of
his
wife
i
have
no
tie
like
him
i
can
meet
death
unappalled
too
young
to
have
tasted
the
pleasures
of
the
world
i
can
not
regret
their
loss
no
no
exclaimed
his
brother
you
are
still
in
the
outset
of
your
career
it
is
i
who
ought
to
fall
at
eight
in
the
morning
the
members
of
the
tribunal
withdrew
to
the
since
the
commencement
of
the
proceedings
the
crowd
far
from
diminishing
seemed
each
day
to
increase
this
morning
it
was
immense
and
though
the
sentence
was
not
expected
to
be
pronounced
till
a
late
hour
no
one
quitted
the
court
for
fear
of
not
being
able
to
find
a
place
when
the
tribunal
should
resume
its

this
decree
was
heard
with
consternation
by
the
assembly
and
soon
spread
throughout
paris
i
may
well
affirm
it
to
have
been
a
day
of
public
mourning
even
though
it
was
sunday
every
place
of
amusement
was
nearly
deserted
to
the
horror
inspired
by
a
sentence
of
death
passed
so
wantonly
and
of
which
the
greater
number
of
the
victims
belonged
to
the
most
distinguished
class
of
society
was
joined
the
ridicule
inspired
by
the
condemnation
of
moreau
of
the
absurdity
of
which
no
one
seemed
more
sensible
than
bonaparte
himself
and
respecting
which
he
expressed
himself
in
the
most
pointed
terms
i
am
persuaded
that
every
one
who
narrowly
watched
the
proceedings
of
this
celebrated
trial
must
have
been
convinced
that
all
means
were
resorted
to
in
order
that
moreau
once
accused
should
not
appear
entirely
free
from
guilt
bonaparte
is
reported
to
have
said
gentlemen
i
have
no
control
over
your
proceedings
it
is
your
duty
strictly
to
examine
the
evidence
before
presenting
a
report
to
me
but
when
it
has
once
the
sanction
of
your
signatures
woe
to
you
if
an
innocent
man
be
condemned
this
remark
is
in
strict
conformity
with
his
usual
language
and
bears
a
striking
similarity
to
the
conversation
i
held
with
him
on
the
following
thursday
but
though
this
language
might
be
appropriate
from
the
lips
of
a
sovereign
whose
ministers
are
responsible
it
appears
but
a
lame
excuse
in
the
mouth
of
bonaparte
the
possessor
of
absolute
power
the
condemned
busied
themselves
in
endeavouring
to
procure
a
repeal
of
their
sentence
the
greatest
number
of
them
yielded
in
this
respect
to
the
entreaties
of
their
friends
who
lost
no
time
in
taking
the
steps
requisite
to
obtain
the
pardon
of
those
in
whom
they
were
most
interested
moreau
at
first
also
determined
to
appeal
but
he
relinquished
his
purpose
before
the
court
of
cessation
commenced
its
sittings
as
soon
as
the
decree
of
the
special
tribunal
was
delivered
murat
governor
of
paris
and
to
the
emperor
sought
his
presence
and
conjured
him
in
the
most
urgent
manner
to
pardon
all
the
criminals
observing
that
such
an
act
of
clemency
would
redound
greatly
to
his
honour
in
the
opinion
of
france
and
all
europe
that
it
would
be
said
the
emperor
pardoned
the
attempt
against
the
life
of
the
first
consul
that
this
act
of
mercy
would
shed
more
glory
over
the
commencement
of
his
reign
than
any
security
which
could
accrue
from
the
execution
of
the
prisoners
such
was
the
conduct
of
murat
but
he
did
not
solicit
as
has
been
reported
the
pardon
of
any
one
in
particular
those
who
obtained
the
imperial
pardon
were

expected
