present
volume
aims
at
furnishing
a
succinct
exposure
of
the
pretensions
of
the
modern
feminist
movement
it
aims
at
presenting
the
case
against
it
with
an
especial
view
to
tracking
down
and
gibbetting
the
infamous
falsehoods
the
conventional
statements
which
are
not
merely
perversions
of
the
truth
but
which
are
directly
and
categorically
contrary
to
the
truth
but
which
pass
muster
by
sheer
force
of
uncontradicted
repetition
it
is
by
this
kind
of
bluff
that
the
claims
of
feminism
are
sustained
the
following
is
a
fair
example
of
the
statements
of
feminist
writers
as
for
accusing
the
world
at
large
of
fatuous
indulgence
for
womanhood
in
general
the
idea
is
too
preposterous
for
words
the
true
legends
of
the
old
bailey
tell
not
of
women
absurdly
acquitted
but
of
miserable
girls
sent
to
the
gallows
for
murders
committed
in
half
delirious
dread
of
the
ruthlessness
of
hypocritical
now
it
is
this
sort
of
legend
that
it
is
one
of
the
chief
objects
of
the
following
pages
to
explode
of
course
the
fatuous
indulgence
for
womanhood
in
general
practised
by
the
world
at
large
is
precisely
one
of
the
most
conspicuous
features
of
our
time
and
the
person
who
denies
it
if
he
is
not
deliberately
prevaricating
must
be
a
veritable
rip
van
winkle
awakening
out
of
a
sleep
lasting
at
least
two
generations
similarly
the
story
of
the
miserable
girls
sent
to
the
gallows
is
as
far
as
living
memory
is
concerned
a
pure
legend
it
is
well
known
that
in
the
cases
referred
to
of
the
murder
of
their
children
by
girls
at
the
very
outside
a
year
or
two
s
light
imprisonment
is
the
only
penalty
actually
inflicted
the
acquittal
of
women
on
the
most
serious
charges
especially
where
the
victims
are
men
in
the
teeth
of
the
strongest
evidence
is
on
the
other
hand
an
everyday
occurrence
now
it
is
statements
like
the
above
on
which
as
already
said
the
feminist
movement
thrives
its
most
powerful
argumentative
weapon
with
the
man
in
the
street
is
the
legend
that
woman
is
oppressed
by
man
it
is
rarely
that
anyone
takes
the
trouble
to
refute
the
legend
in
general
or
any
specific
case
adduced
as
an
illustration
of
it
when
however
the
bluff
is
exposed
when
the
real
facts
of
the
case
are
laid
bare
to
public
notice
and
woman
is
shown
not
only
as
not
oppressed
but
as
privileged
up
to
the
top
of
her
bent
then
the
apostles
of
feminism
male
and
female
being
unable
to
make
even
a
plausible
case
out
in
reply
with
one
consent
resort
to
the
boycott
and
by
ignoring
what
they
can
not
answer
seek
to
stop
the
spread
of
the
unpleasant
truth
so
dangerous
to
their
cause
the
pressure
put
upon
publishers
and
editors
by
the
influential
feminist
sisterhood
is
well
the
rest
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
this
little
book
makes
any
claim
to
exhaust
the
subject
or
to
be
a
scientific
treatise
it
is
and
is
meant
to
be
a
popular
refutation
of
the
current
arguments
in
favour
of
feminism
and
a
brief
statement
of
the
case
against
feminism
sir
almroth
wright
s
short
treatise
the
unexpurgated
case
against
woman
s
suffrage
which
deals
with
the
question
from
a
somewhat
different
standpoint
may
be
consulted
with
advantage
by
the
acknowledgment
should
be
made
to
the
editor
of
new
for
the
plucky
stand
made
by
that
journal
in
the
attempt
to
dam
the
onrush
of
sentimental
slush
set
free
by
the
champions
of
womanhood
i
have
also
to
thank
two
eminent
medical
authorities
for
reading
the
proofs
of
my
second
introduction
in
the
following
pages
it
is
not
intended
to
furnish
a
treatise
on
the
evolution
of
woman
generally
or
of
her
place
in
society
but
simply
to
offer
a
criticism
on
the
theory
and
practice
of
what
is
known
as
modern
feminism
by
modern
feminism
i
understand
a
certain
attitude
of
mind
towards
the
female
sex
this
attitude
of
mind
is
often
and
illogical
while
on
the
one
hand
it
will
claim
on
the
ground
of
the
intellectual
and
moral
equality
of
women
with
men
the
concession
of
female
suffrage
and
commonly
in
addition
thereto
the
admission
of
women
to
all
professions
offices
and
functions
of
public
life
on
the
other
it
will
strenuously
champion
the
preservation
and
intensification
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
before
the
law
criminal
and
civil
in
favour
of
women
which
have
grown
up
in
the
course
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
above
attitude
with
all
its
inconsistencies
has
at
its
back
a
strong
party
or
sex
union
as
we
may
term
it
among
women
and
a
floating
mass
of
inconsequent
slushy
sentiment
among
men
there
is
more
than
one
popular
prejudice
which
obscures
the
meaning
and
significance
of
modern
feminism
with
many
people
there
is
a
common
theory
for
instance
based
upon
what
really
obtained
to
some
extent
before
the
prevalence
of
modern
feminism
that
in
any
case
of
antagonism
between
the
two
sexes
women
always
take
the
man
s
side
against
the
woman
now
this
theory
if
it
ever
represented
the
true
state
of
the
case
has
long
ceased
to
do
so
the
powerful
female
sex
union
spoken
of
in
the
present
day
exercises
such
a
strong
pressure
in
the
formation
of
public
opinion
among
women
that
it
is
rapidly
becoming
next
to
impossible
even
in
the
most
flagrant
cases
where
man
is
the
victim
to
get
any
woman
to
acknowledge
that
another
woman
has
committed
a
wrong
on
the
other
hand
it
may
be
noted
that
the
entire
absence
of
any
consciousness
of
sex
antagonism
in
the
attitude
of
men
towards
women
combined
with
an
intensification
of
the
chivalry
prescribed
by
tradition
towards
the
weaker
sex
exercises
if
anything
an
increasing
sway
over
male
public
opinion
hence
the
terrific
force
feminism
has
obtained
in
the
world
of
the
early
twentieth
century
it
is
again
often
supposed
and
this
is
also
a
mistake
that
in
individual
cases
of
dispute
between
the
sexes
the
verdict
let
us
say
of
a
jury
of
men
in
favour
of
the
female
prisoner
or
the
female
litigant
is
solely
or
even
mainly
determined
by
the
fact
of
the
latter
s
good
looks
this
may
indeed
play
a
part
but
it
is
easy
to
show
from
records
of
cases
that
it
is
a
subordinate
whatever
her
looks
or
her
age
may
be
the
verdict
is
given
her
not
so
much
because
she
is
a
woman
as
because
she
is
a
here
again
the
question
of
attractiveness
may
have
played
a
more
potent
part
in
determining
male
verdicts
in
the
days
before
feminist
sentiment
and
feminist
views
had
reached
their
present
dominance
but
now
the
question
of
sex
alone
of
being
a
woman
is
sufficient
to
determine
judgment
in
her
favour
there
is
a
trick
with
which
votaries
of
feminism
seek
to
prejudice
the
public
mind
against
its
critics
and
that
is
the
fake
that
any
man
who
ventures
to
criticise
the
pretensions
of
feminism
is
actuated
by
motives
of
personal
rancour
against
the
female
sex
owing
to
real
or
imaginary
wrongs
suffered
by
him
at
the
hands
of
some
member
or
members
of
the
sex
i
suppose
it
may
be
possible
that
there
are
persons
not
precisely
microcephalous
idiots
who
could
be
made
to
believe
such
stuff
as
this
in
disparagement
of
him
who
ventures
an
independent
judgment
on
these
questions
otherwise
the
conduct
of
feminists
in
adopting
this
line
of
argument
would
be
incomprehensible
but
we
would
fain
believe
that
the
number
of
these
persons
who
believe
there
is
any
connection
between
a
man
having
independent
judgment
enough
to
refuse
to
bend
the
knee
to
modern
feminist
dogma
and
his
having
quarrelled
with
any
or
all
of
his
female
friends
or
relations
can
not
be
very
numerous
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
is
not
one
single
prominent
exponent
of
views
hostile
to
the
pretensions
of
what
is
called
the
woman
s
movement
of
the
present
day
respecting
whom
there
is
a
tittle
of
evidence
of
his
not
having
lived
all
his
life
on
the
best
of
terms
with
his
womankind
there
is
only
one
case
known
of
indirectly
by
the
present
writer
and
that
not
of
a
prominent
writer
or
speaker
on
the
subject
that
would
afford
any
plausible
excuse
whatever
for
alleging
views
to
have
been
influenced
by
personal
motives
of
this
kind
i
am
aware
of
course
that
feminists
with
their
usual
mendacity
have
made
lying
statements
to
this
effect
respecting
every
prominent
writer
on
the
side
in
the
hope
of
influencing
the
aforesaid
members
of
the
public
against
their
opponents
but
a
very
little
investigation
suffices
to
show
in
every
case
the
impudent
baselessness
of
their
allegations
the
contemptible
silliness
of
this
method
of
controversy
should
render
it
unworthy
of
serious
remark
and
my
only
excuse
for
alluding
to
it
is
the
significant
sidelight
it
casts
upon
the
intellectual
calibre
of
those
who
resort
to
it
and
of
the
confidence
or
want
of
confidence
they
have
in
the
inherent
justice
of
their
cause
and
the
logical
strength
of
their
case
chapter
i
historical
the
position
of
women
in
social
life
was
for
a
long
time
a
matter
of
course
it
did
not
arise
as
a
question
because
it
was
taken
for
granted
the
dominance
of
men
seemed
to
derive
so
obviously
from
natural
causes
from
the
possession
of
faculties
physical
moral
and
intellectual
in
men
which
were
wanting
in
women
that
no
one
thought
of
questioning
the
situation
at
the
same
time
the
inferiority
of
woman
was
never
conceived
as
so
great
as
to
diminish
seriously
much
less
to
eliminate
altogether
her
responsibility
for
crimes
she
might
commit
there
were
cases
of
course
such
as
that
of
offences
committed
by
women
under
coverture
in
which
a
diminution
of
responsibility
was
recognised
and
was
given
effect
to
in
condonation
of
the
offence
and
in
mitigation
of
the
punishment
but
there
was
no
sentiment
in
general
in
favour
of
a
female
more
than
of
a
male
criminal
it
entered
into
the
head
of
no
one
to
weep
tears
of
pity
over
the
murderess
of
a
lover
or
husband
rather
than
over
the
murderer
of
a
sweetheart
or
wife
similarly
minor
offenders
a
female
blackmailer
a
female
thief
a
female
perpetrator
of
an
assault
was
not
deemed
less
guilty
or
worthy
of
more
lenient
treatment
than
a
male
offender
in
like
cases
the
law
it
was
assumed
and
the
assumption
was
acted
upon
was
the
same
for
both
sexes
the
sexes
were
equal
before
the
law
the
laws
were
harsher
in
some
respects
than
now
although
not
perhaps
in
all
but
there
was
no
special
line
of
demarcation
as
regards
the
punishment
of
offences
as
between
men
and
women
the
penalty
ordained
by
the
law
for
crime
or
misdemeanour
was
the
same
for
both
and
in
general
applied
equally
to
both
likewise
in
civil
suits
proceedings
were
not
specially
weighted
against
the
man
and
in
favour
of
the
woman
there
was
as
a
general
rule
no
very
noticeable
sex
partiality
in
the
administration
of
the
law
this
state
of
affairs
continued
in
england
till
well
into
the
nineteenth
century
thenceforward
a
change
began
to
take
place
modern
feminism
rose
slowly
above
the
horizon
modern
feminism
has
two
distinct
sides
to
it
an
articulate
political
and
economic
side
embracing
demands
for
rights
and
a
sentimental
side
which
insists
in
an
accentuation
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
which
have
grown
up
not
articulately
or
as
the
result
of
definite
demands
but
as
the
consequence
of
sentimental
pleading
in
particular
cases
in
this
way
however
a
public
opinion
became
established
finding
expression
in
a
sex
favouritism
in
the
law
and
even
still
more
in
its
administration
in
favour
of
women
as
against
men
these
two
sides
of
modern
feminism
are
not
necessarily
combined
in
the
same
person
one
may
for
example
find
opponents
of
female
suffrage
who
are
strong
advocates
of
sentimental
favouritism
towards
women
in
matters
of
law
and
its
administration
on
the
other
hand
you
may
find
though
this
is
more
rare
strong
advocates
of
political
and
other
rights
for
the
female
sex
who
sincerely
deprecate
the
present
inequality
of
the
law
in
favour
of
women
as
a
rule
however
the
two
sides
go
together
the
vast
bulk
of
the
advocates
of
women
s
rights
being
equally
keen
on
the
retention
and
extension
of
women
s
privileges
indeed
it
would
seem
as
though
the
main
object
of
the
bulk
of
the
advocates
of
the
woman
s
movement
was
to
convert
the
female
sex
into
the
position
of
a
dominant
the
two
sides
of
feminism
have
advanced
hand
in
hand
for
the
last
two
generations
though
it
was
the
purely
sentimental
side
that
first
appeared
as
a
factor
in
public
opinion
the
attempt
to
paint
women
in
a
different
light
to
the
traditional
one
of
physical
intellectual
and
moral
inferiority
to
men
probably
received
its
first
literary
expression
in
a
treatise
published
in
by
cornelius
agrippa
of
nettesheim
entitled
nobilitate
et
praecellentia
feminei
and
dedicated
to
margaret
regent
of
the
netherlands
whose
favour
agrippa
was
at
that
time
desirous
of
courting
the
ancient
world
has
nothing
to
offer
in
the
shape
of
literary
forerunners
of
modern
feminism
although
that
industrious
collector
of
historical
odds
and
ends
valerius
maximus
relates
the
story
of
one
afrania
who
with
some
of
her
friends
created
disturbances
in
the
law
courts
of
ancient
rome
in
her
attempt
to
make
women
s
voices
heard
before
the
tribunals
as
regards
more
recent
ages
after
agrippa
we
have
to
wait
till
the
early
years
of
the
eighteenth
century
for
another
instance
of
feminism
before
its
time
in
an
essay
on
the
subject
of
woman
by
daniel
defoe
but
it
was
not
till
the
closing
years
of
the
eighteenth
century
that
any
considerable
expression
of
opinion
in
favour
of
changing
the
relative
positions
of
the
sexes
by
upsetting
the
view
of
their
respective
values
founded
on
the
general
experience
of
mankind
made
itself
noticeable
the
names
of
mary
wollstonecraft
in
english
literature
and
of
condorcet
in
french
will
hardly
fail
to
occur
to
the
reader
in
this
connection
during
the
french
revolution
the
crazy
olympe
de
gouges
achieved
ephemeral
notoriety
by
her
claim
for
the
intellectual
equality
of
women
with
men
up
to
this
time
the
close
of
the
eighteenth
century
no
advance
whatever
had
been
made
by
legislation
in
recognising
the
modern
theory
of
sex
equality
the
claims
of
women
and
their
apologists
for
entering
upon
the
functions
of
men
political
social
or
otherwise
although
put
forward
from
time
to
time
by
isolated
individuals
received
little
countenance
from
public
opinion
and
still
less
from
the
law
what
i
have
called
however
the
sentimental
aspect
of
modern
feminism
undoubtedly
did
make
some
headway
in
public
opinion
by
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
grew
in
volume
during
the
early
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
it
effectuated
in
the
act
passed
in
by
the
english
parliament
abolishing
the
punishment
of
flogging
for
female
criminals
this
was
the
first
beginning
of
the
differentiation
of
the
sexes
in
the
matter
of
the
criminal
law
the
parliamentary
debate
on
the
bill
in
question
shows
clearly
enough
the
power
that
sentimental
feminism
had
acquired
in
public
opinion
in
the
course
of
a
generation
for
no
proposal
was
made
at
the
same
time
to
abolish
the
punishment
of
flogging
so
far
as
men
were
concerned
up
to
this
time
the
criminal
law
of
england
as
of
other
countries
made
no
distinction
whatever
between
the
sexes
in
the
matter
of
crime
and
punishment
or
at
least
no
distinction
based
on
the
principle
or
sentiment
of
sex
privilege
a
slight
exception
might
be
made
perhaps
in
the
crime
of
petty
treason
which
distinguished
the
murder
of
a
husband
by
his
wife
from
other
cases
of
homicide
but
from
this
time
forward
legislation
and
administration
have
diverged
farther
and
farther
from
the
principle
of
sex
equality
in
this
connection
in
favour
of
female
immunity
the
result
being
that
at
the
present
day
assuming
the
punishment
meted
out
to
the
woman
for
a
given
crime
to
represent
a
normal
penalty
the
man
receives
an
additional
increment
over
and
above
that
accorded
to
the
crime
the
offence
of
having
been
born
a
man
and
not
a
i
should
explain
that
i
attach
a
distinct
meaning
to
the
word
as
used
by
me
it
does
not
signify
as
it
does
with
most
people
an
excess
of
sentiment
over
and
above
what
i
feel
myself
but
a
sentiment
unequally
distributed
as
used
in
this
sense
the
repulsion
to
the
flogging
of
women
while
no
repulsion
is
felt
to
the
flogging
of
men
is
pure
and
simple
on
the
other
hand
the
objection
to
flogging
altogether
as
punishment
for
men
or
women
could
not
be
described
as
sentimentalism
whatever
else
it
might
be
in
the
same
way
the
s
aversion
to
physiological
experiments
on
animals
if
confined
to
household
pets
and
not
extended
to
other
animals
might
be
justly
described
as
sentimentalism
but
one
who
objected
to
such
experiments
on
all
animals
no
matter
whether
one
agreed
with
his
point
of
view
or
not
could
not
be
justly
charged
with
sentimentalism
or
at
least
not
unless
while
objecting
to
vivisection
he
or
she
were
prepared
to
condone
other
acts
involving
an
equal
amount
of
cruelty
to
animals
the
original
divorce
law
of
in
its
provisions
respecting
costs
and
alimony
constitutes
another
landmark
in
the
matter
of
female
privilege
before
the
law
other
measures
of
unilateral
sex
legislation
followed
in
the
years
ensuing
until
the
present
state
of
things
by
which
the
whole
power
of
the
state
is
practically
at
the
disposal
of
woman
to
coerce
and
oppress
men
but
this
side
of
the
question
we
propose
to
deal
with
later
on
the
present
actual
movement
of
feminism
in
political
and
social
life
may
be
deemed
to
have
begun
in
the
early
sixties
in
the
agitation
which
preceded
the
motion
of
john
stuart
mill
in
on
the
question
of
conferring
the
parliamentary
franchise
upon
women
this
was
coincident
with
an
agitation
for
the
opening
of
various
careers
to
women
notably
the
medical
faculty
we
are
speaking
of
course
here
of
great
britain
which
was
first
in
the
field
in
europe
alike
in
the
theory
and
practice
of
modern
feminism
but
the
publication
by
the
great
protagonist
of
the
movement
john
stuart
mill
of
his
book
the
subjection
of
women
in
endowed
the
cause
with
a
literary
gospel
which
was
soon
translated
into
the
chief
languages
of
the
continent
and
corresponding
movements
started
in
other
countries
strangely
enough
it
made
considerable
headway
in
russia
the
awakening
of
russia
to
western
ideas
having
recently
begun
to
make
itself
felt
at
the
time
of
which
we
are
speaking
the
movement
henceforth
took
its
place
as
a
permanent
factor
in
the
political
and
social
life
of
this
and
other
countries
bills
for
female
suffrage
were
introduced
every
year
into
the
british
house
of
commons
with
on
the
whole
yearly
diminishing
majorities
against
these
measures
till
a
few
years
back
the
scale
turned
on
the
other
side
and
the
women
s
enfranchisement
bill
passed
every
year
its
second
reading
until
when
for
the
first
time
for
many
years
it
was
rejected
by
a
small
majority
meanwhile
both
sides
of
the
feminist
movement
apart
from
the
question
of
the
franchise
had
been
gaining
in
influence
municipal
franchise
on
the
same
terms
as
for
men
had
been
conceded
women
have
voted
for
and
sat
on
school
boards
boards
of
guardians
and
other
public
bodies
their
claim
to
exercise
the
medical
profession
has
been
not
merely
admitted
in
law
but
recognised
in
public
opinion
for
long
past
all
the
advantages
of
an
academic
career
have
been
opened
to
them
with
the
solitary
exception
of
the
actual
conferment
of
degrees
at
oxford
and
cambridge
such
has
been
the
growth
of
the
articulate
and
political
side
of
the
theory
of
modern
feminism
the
sentimental
side
of
feminism
with
its
practical
result
of
the
overweighting
of
justice
in
the
interests
of
women
in
the
courts
civil
as
well
as
criminal
and
their
practical
immunity
from
the
operation
of
the
criminal
law
when
in
the
dock
has
advanced
correspondingly
while
at
the
same
time
the
sword
of
that
same
criminal
law
is
sharpened
to
a
razor
edge
against
the
man
even
accused
let
alone
convicted
of
any
offence
against
the
sacrosanct
majesty
of
such
is
the
present
position
of
the
woman
question
in
this
country
which
we
take
as
typical
in
the
sense
that
in
great
britain
to
which
we
may
also
add
the
united
states
of
america
and
the
british
colonies
possible
the
movement
is
stronger
than
in
the
mother
country
see
the
logical
outcome
of
feminist
theory
and
sentiment
it
remains
to
consider
the
existing
facts
more
in
detail
and
the
psychological
bearings
of
that
large
number
of
persons
who
have
been
in
the
recent
past
and
are
being
at
the
present
time
influenced
to
accept
the
dogmas
of
modern
feminism
and
the
statements
of
alleged
facts
made
by
its
votaries
before
doing
so
it
behoves
us
to
examine
the
credibility
of
the
dogmas
themselves
and
the
nature
of
the
arguments
used
to
support
them
and
also
the
accuracy
of
the
alleged
facts
employed
by
the
feminists
to
stimulate
the
indignation
of
the
popular
mind
against
the
pretended
wrongs
of
women
chapter
ii
the
main
dogma
of
modern
feminism
we
have
pointed
out
in
the
last
chapter
that
modern
feminism
has
two
sides
the
positive
definite
and
articulate
side
which
ostensibly
claims
equality
between
the
sexes
the
chief
concern
of
which
is
the
conferring
of
all
the
rights
and
duties
of
men
upon
women
and
the
opening
up
of
all
careers
to
them
the
justification
of
these
demands
is
based
upon
the
dogma
that
notwithstanding
appearances
to
the
contrary
women
are
endowed
by
nature
with
the
same
capacity
intellectually
and
morally
as
men
we
have
further
pointed
out
that
there
is
another
side
in
modern
feminism
which
in
a
vague
way
claims
for
women
immunity
from
criminal
law
and
special
privileges
on
the
ground
of
sex
in
civil
law
the
basis
of
this
side
of
feminism
is
a
an
unequally
distributed
sentiment
in
favour
of
women
traditional
and
acquired
it
is
seldom
even
attempted
to
base
this
sentimental
claim
for
women
on
argument
at
all
the
utmost
attempts
in
this
direction
amount
to
vague
references
to
physical
weakness
and
to
the
claim
for
special
consideration
deriving
from
the
old
theory
of
the
mental
and
moral
weakness
of
the
female
sex
so
strenuously
combated
as
out
of
date
when
the
first
side
of
modern
feminism
is
being
contended
for
the
more
or
less
inchoate
assumptions
of
the
second
or
sentimental
side
of
the
modern
woman
s
movement
amounts
practically
as
already
stated
to
a
claim
for
women
to
be
allowed
to
commit
crimes
without
incurring
the
penalties
imposed
by
the
law
for
similar
crimes
when
committed
by
men
it
should
be
noted
that
in
practice
the
most
strenuous
advocates
of
the
positive
and
articulate
side
of
feminism
are
also
the
sincerest
upholders
of
the
unsubstantial
and
inarticulate
assumptions
of
the
sentimental
side
of
the
same
creed
this
is
noticeable
whenever
a
woman
is
found
guilty
of
a
particularly
atrocious
crime
it
is
somewhat
rare
for
women
to
be
convicted
of
such
crimes
at
all
since
the
influence
of
sentimental
feminism
with
judges
and
juries
is
sufficient
to
procure
an
acquittal
no
matter
how
conclusive
the
evidence
to
the
contrary
even
if
women
are
found
guilty
it
is
usual
for
a
virtually
nominal
sentence
to
be
passed
should
however
a
woman
by
any
chance
be
convicted
of
a
heinous
crime
such
as
murder
or
maiming
under
specially
aggravated
circumstances
and
a
sentence
be
passed
such
as
would
be
unanimously
sanctioned
by
public
opinion
in
the
case
of
a
man
then
we
find
the
whole
feminist
world
up
in
arms
the
outcry
is
led
by
upholders
of
equality
between
the
sexes
the
apostles
of
the
positive
side
of
feminism
who
claim
the
eradication
of
sex
boundaries
in
political
and
social
life
on
the
ground
of
women
being
of
equal
capacity
with
men
but
who
when
moral
responsibility
is
in
question
conveniently
fall
back
on
a
sentiment
the
only
conceivable
ground
for
which
is
to
be
found
in
the
theory
of
the
mental
and
moral
weakness
of
the
female
sex
as
illustrations
of
the
truth
of
the
foregoing
the
reader
may
be
referred
to
the
cases
of
florence
doughty
in
who
shot
at
and
wounded
a
solicitor
with
whom
she
had
relations
together
with
his
son
to
daisy
lord
in
for
the
murder
of
her
child
to
the
case
of
the
italian
murderess
napolitano
in
canada
convicted
of
the
butchery
of
her
husband
in
his
sleep
in
for
whose
reprieve
a
successful
agitation
was
got
up
by
the
suffrage
societies
let
us
first
of
all
consider
the
dogma
at
the
basis
of
the
positive
side
of
modern
feminism
which
claims
rational
grounds
of
fact
and
reason
for
itself
and
professes
to
be
able
to
make
good
its
case
by
virtue
of
such
grounds
this
dogma
consists
in
the
assertion
of
equality
in
intellectual
capacity
in
spite
of
appearances
to
the
contrary
of
women
with
men
i
think
it
will
be
admitted
that
the
articulate
objects
of
modern
feminism
taking
them
one
with
another
rest
on
this
dogma
and
on
this
dogma
alone
i
know
it
has
been
argued
as
regards
the
question
of
suffrage
that
the
demand
does
not
rest
solely
upon
the
admission
of
equality
of
capacity
since
men
of
a
notoriously
inferior
mental
order
are
not
excluded
from
voting
upon
that
ground
but
the
fallacy
of
this
last
argument
is
obvious
in
all
these
matters
we
have
to
deal
with
averages
public
opinion
has
hitherto
recognised
the
average
of
women
as
being
intellectually
below
the
voting
standard
and
the
average
man
as
not
this
if
admitted
is
enough
to
establish
the
thesis
the
latter
is
not
affected
by
the
fact
that
it
is
possible
to
find
certain
individual
men
of
inferior
intelligence
and
therefore
less
intrinsically
qualified
to
form
a
political
judgment
than
certain
specially
gifted
women
the
pretended
absurdity
of
george
eliot
having
no
vote
and
of
her
gardener
having
one
is
really
no
absurdity
at
all
in
the
first
place
given
the
economic
advantages
which
conferred
education
upon
the
novelist
and
not
upon
the
gardener
there
is
not
sufficient
evidence
available
that
his
judgment
in
public
affairs
might
not
have
been
even
superior
to
that
of
george
eliot
herself
moreover
the
possession
of
exceptionally
strong
imaginative
faculty
expressing
itself
as
literary
genius
or
talent
in
works
of
fiction
does
not
necessarily
imply
exceptional
power
of
political
judgment
but
be
this
as
it
may
where
averages
are
in
question
exceptions
obviously
do
not
count
the
underlying
assumption
of
the
suffrage
movement
may
therefore
be
taken
to
be
the
average
equality
of
the
sexes
as
regards
intellectual
value
i
believe
there
are
some
feminist
fanatics
who
pretend
to
maintain
the
superiority
of
the
female
mind
but
i
doubt
whether
this
thesis
is
taken
seriously
even
by
those
who
put
it
forward
in
any
case
there
are
limits
to
the
patent
absurditie
which
it
is
worth
while
to
refute
by
argument
an
initial
difficulty
exists
in
proving
theoretically
the
intellectual
inferiority
of
women
to
men
or
even
their
relative
unsuitability
for
fulfilling
functions
involving
a
special
order
of
judgment
there
are
such
things
as
matters
of
fact
which
are
open
to
common
observation
and
which
none
think
of
denying
or
calling
in
question
unless
they
have
some
special
reason
for
doing
so
now
it
is
always
possible
to
deny
a
fact
however
evident
it
may
be
to
ordinary
perception
and
it
is
equally
impossible
to
prove
that
the
person
calling
in
question
the
aforesaid
evident
fact
is
either
lying
or
shall
we
say
is
prevaricating
or
even
that
he
is
a
person
hopelessly
abnormal
in
his
organs
of
at
the
time
of
writing
the
normal
person
who
has
no
axe
to
grind
in
maintaining
the
contrary
declares
the
sun
to
be
shining
brightly
but
should
it
answer
the
purpose
of
anyone
to
deny
this
obvious
fact
and
declare
that
the
day
is
gloomy
and
overcast
there
is
no
power
of
argument
by
which
i
can
prove
that
i
am
right
and
he
is
wrong
i
may
point
to
the
sun
but
if
he
chooses
to
affirm
that
he
doesn
t
see
it
i
can
t
prove
that
he
does
this
is
of
course
an
extreme
case
scarcely
likely
to
occur
in
actual
life
but
it
is
in
essence
similar
to
those
cases
of
persons
and
they
are
not
seldom
met
with
who
when
they
find
facts
hopelessly
destructive
of
a
certain
theoretical
position
adopted
by
them
do
not
hesitate
to
cut
the
knot
of
controversy
in
their
own
favour
by
boldly
denying
the
inconvenient
facts
one
often
has
experience
of
this
trick
of
controversy
in
discussing
the
question
of
the
notorious
characteristics
of
the
female
sex
the
feminist
driven
into
a
corner
endeavours
to
save
his
face
by
flatly
denying
matters
open
to
common
observation
and
admitted
as
obvious
by
all
who
are
not
feminists
such
facts
are
the
pathological
mental
condition
peculiar
to
the
female
sex
commonly
connoted
by
the
term
hysteria
the
absence
or
at
best
the
extremely
imperfect
development
of
the
logical
faculty
in
most
women
the
inability
of
the
average
woman
in
her
judgment
of
things
to
rise
above
personal
considerations
and
what
is
largely
a
consequence
of
this
the
lack
of
a
sense
of
abstract
justice
and
fair
play
among
women
in
general
the
aforesaid
peculiarities
of
women
as
women
are
i
contend
matters
of
common
observation
and
are
only
disputed
by
those
wit
whose
theoretical
views
and
practical
demands
their
admission
would
be
inconvenient
if
not
fatal
of
course
these
characterisations
refer
to
averages
and
they
do
not
exclude
partial
or
even
occasionally
striking
exceptions
it
is
possible
therefore
although
perhaps
not
very
probable
that
individual
experience
may
in
the
case
of
certain
individuals
play
a
part
in
falsifying
their
general
outlook
it
is
as
i
before
said
not
perhaps
very
any
given
man
s
experience
of
the
other
sex
has
been
limited
to
a
few
quite
exceptional
women
and
that
hence
his
particular
experience
contradicts
that
of
the
general
run
of
mankind
in
this
case
of
course
his
refusal
to
admit
what
to
others
are
facts
would
be
perfectly
the
above
highly
improbable
contingency
is
the
only
refuge
for
those
who
would
contend
for
sincerity
in
the
feminist
s
denials
in
this
matter
i
only
deal
with
the
male
feminist
the
female
feminist
is
usually
too
biassed
a
witness
in
this
particular
question
now
let
us
consider
the
whole
of
the
differentiations
of
the
mental
character
between
man
and
woman
in
the
light
of
a
further
generalisation
which
is
sufficiently
obvious
in
itself
and
which
has
been
formulated
with
special
clearness
by
the
late
otto
weininger
in
his
remarkable
book
geschlecht
und
charakter
sex
and
character
i
refer
to
the
observations
contained
in
section
chaps
and
the
point
has
been
of
course
previously
noted
and
the
present
writer
among
others
has
on
various
occasions
called
special
attention
to
it
but
its
formulation
and
elaboration
by
weininger
is
the
most
complete
i
know
the
truth
in
question
consists
in
the
fact
undeniable
to
all
those
not
rendered
impervious
to
facts
by
preconceived
dogma
that
as
i
have
elsewhere
put
it
while
man
a
sex
woman
a
sex
let
us
hear
weininger
on
this
point
woman
is
sexual
man
is
sexual
alike
in
time
and
space
this
difference
may
be
traced
in
man
parts
of
his
body
susceptible
to
sexual
excitement
are
small
in
number
and
strictly
localised
in
woman
sexuality
is
diffused
over
the
whole
body
every
contact
on
whatever
part
excites
her
weininger
points
out
that
while
the
sexual
element
in
man
owing
to
the
physiological
character
of
the
sexual
organs
may
be
at
times
more
violent
than
that
in
woman
yet
that
it
is
spasmodic
and
occurs
in
crises
separated
by
intervals
of
quiescence
in
woman
on
the
other
hand
while
less
spasmodic
it
is
continuous
the
sexual
instinct
with
man
being
as
he
styles
it
an
appendix
and
no
more
he
can
raise
himself
mentally
entirely
outside
of
it
he
is
conscious
of
it
as
of
something
which
he
possesses
but
which
is
not
inseparate
from
the
rest
of
his
nature
he
can
view
it
objectively
with
woman
this
is
not
the
case
the
sex
element
is
part
of
her
whole
nature
hence
it
is
not
as
with
man
clearly
recognisable
in
local
manifestations
but
subtly
affects
the
whole
life
of
the
organism
for
this
reason
the
man
is
conscious
of
the
sexual
element
within
him
as
such
whereas
the
woman
is
unconscious
of
it
as
such
it
is
not
for
nothing
that
in
common
parlance
woman
is
spoken
of
as
the
in
this
sexual
differentiation
of
the
whole
of
woman
from
man
deducible
as
it
is
from
physiological
and
anatomical
distinctions
lies
the
ground
of
those
differentiations
of
function
which
culminate
in
the
fact
that
while
mankind
in
its
intellectual
moral
and
technical
development
is
represented
in
the
main
by
man
woman
has
continued
to
find
her
chief
function
in
the
direct
procreation
of
the
a
variety
of
causes
notably
modern
economic
development
in
their
effect
on
family
life
also
the
illegitimate
application
of
the
modern
democratic
notion
of
the
equality
of
classes
and
races
to
that
of
sex
has
contributed
to
the
modern
revolt
against
natural
sex
limitations
assuming
the
substantial
accuracy
of
the
above
statement
of
fact
the
absurdity
and
cheapness
of
the
of
the
modern
social
purity
monger
as
to
having
one
and
the
same
sexual
morality
for
both
sexes
will
be
readily
seen
the
recognition
of
the
necessity
of
admitting
greater
latitude
in
this
respect
to
men
than
to
women
is
based
clearly
on
physiology
and
with
men
sexual
instinct
manifests
itself
locally
and
at
intervals
its
satisfaction
is
an
urgent
and
pressing
need
with
woman
this
is
not
so
hence
the
recognised
distinction
between
the
sexes
in
this
respect
is
as
far
as
it
goes
a
thoroughly
sound
one
not
that
i
am
championing
the
severity
of
the
restrictions
of
the
current
sexual
code
as
regards
women
on
the
contrary
i
think
it
ought
to
be
and
will
be
in
a
reasonable
society
of
the
future
considerably
relaxed
i
am
only
pointing
out
that
the
urgency
is
not
so
great
in
the
one
case
as
in
the
other
and
this
fact
it
is
which
has
led
to
the
toleration
of
a
stringency
originally
arising
mainly
from
economic
causes
questions
of
inheritance
and
the
like
in
the
case
of
women
which
would
not
have
been
tolerated
in
that
of
men
even
had
similar
reasons
for
its
adoption
in
their
case
obtained
any
successful
attempt
of
social
purity
mongers
to
run
counter
to
physiology
in
enforcing
either
by
legislation
or
public
opinion
the
same
stringency
on
men
in
this
respect
as
on
women
could
but
have
the
most
disastrous
consequences
to
the
health
and
of
the
community
it
was
a
saying
of
the
late
dr
henry
maudsley
lies
deeper
than
by
this
we
may
understand
to
be
meant
that
sex
differences
are
organic
all
authorities
on
the
physiological
question
are
agreed
that
woman
is
less
less
than
man
dr
de
varigny
asserts
that
this
fact
is
traceable
throughout
the
whole
female
organism
throughout
all
its
tissues
and
all
its
functions
for
instance
the
stature
of
the
human
female
is
less
than
that
of
the
man
in
all
races
as
regards
weight
there
is
a
corresponding
difference
the
adult
woman
weighs
on
the
average
rather
more
than
lbs
less
than
the
man
moreover
as
a
rule
a
woman
completes
her
growth
some
years
earlier
than
a
man
the
bones
are
lighter
in
the
woman
than
in
the
man
not
absolutely
but
in
proportion
to
the
weight
of
the
body
they
are
it
is
stated
not
merely
thinner
but
more
fragile
the
difference
may
be
traced
even
to
their
chemical
composition
the
whole
muscular
development
is
inferior
in
woman
to
that
in
man
by
about
the
heart
in
woman
is
smaller
and
lighter
than
in
about
oz
in
man
as
against
slightly
over
oz
in
woman
in
the
woman
the
respiratory
organs
show
less
chest
and
lung
capacity
again
the
blood
contains
a
considerably
less
proportion
of
red
to
white
corpuscles
finally
we
come
to
the
question
of
the
size
and
constitution
of
the
brain
it
should
be
observed
that
all
these
distinctions
of
sex
show
themselves
more
or
less
from
birth
onwards
specialists
are
agreed
that
at
all
ages
the
size
of
the
brain
of
woman
is
less
than
that
of
man
the
difference
in
relative
size
is
greater
in
proportion
according
to
the
degree
of
civilisation
this
is
noteworthy
as
it
would
seem
as
though
the
brain
of
man
grew
with
the
progress
of
civilisation
whereas
that
of
woman
remains
nearly
stationary
the
average
proportion
as
regards
size
of
skull
between
the
woman
and
man
of
is
as
to
the
weight
of
brain
in
woman
varies
from
oz
to
oz
in
man
from
oz
to
oz
this
represents
the
absolute
difference
in
weight
but
according
to
dr
de
varigny
the
relative
the
weight
in
proportion
to
that
of
the
whole
even
more
striking
in
its
indication
of
inferiority
the
weight
of
the
brain
in
woman
is
but
of
the
weight
of
the
body
while
in
man
it
is
this
difference
accentuates
itself
with
age
it
is
only
per
cent
in
favour
of
man
between
twenty
and
thirty
years
it
is
per
cent
between
thirty
and
forty
years
as
regards
the
substance
of
the
brain
itself
and
its
convolutions
the
enormous
majority
of
physiologists
are
practically
unanimous
in
declaring
that
the
female
brain
is
simpler
and
smoother
its
convolutions
fewer
and
more
superficial
than
those
of
the
male
brain
that
the
frontal
lobes
generally
associated
with
the
intellectual
faculties
are
less
developed
than
the
occipital
lobes
which
are
universally
connected
with
the
lower
psychological
functions
the
grey
substance
is
poorer
and
less
abundant
in
woman
than
in
man
while
the
blood
vessels
of
the
occipital
region
are
correspondingly
fuller
than
those
supplying
the
frontal
lobes
in
man
the
case
is
exactly
the
reverse
it
can
not
be
denied
by
any
sane
person
familiar
with
the
barest
elements
of
physiology
that
the
whole
female
organism
is
subservient
to
the
functions
of
and
lactation
which
explains
the
inferior
development
of
those
organs
and
faculties
which
are
not
specially
connected
with
this
supreme
end
of
woman
it
is
the
fashion
of
feminists
ignoring
these
fundamental
physiological
sex
differences
to
affirm
that
the
actual
inferiority
of
women
where
they
have
the
honesty
to
admit
such
an
obvious
fact
is
accountable
by
the
centuries
of
oppression
in
which
woman
has
been
held
by
wicked
and
man
the
absurdity
of
this
contention
has
been
more
than
once
pointed
out
assuming
its
foundation
in
fact
what
does
it
imply
clearly
that
the
girls
inherit
only
through
their
mothers
and
boys
only
through
their
fathers
an
hypothesis
plainly
at
variance
with
the
known
facts
of
heredity
yet
those
who
maintain
that
distinction
of
intelligence
between
the
sexes
are
traceable
to
external
conditions
affecting
one
sex
only
and
inherited
through
that
sex
alone
can
not
evade
the
above
assumption
those
therefore
who
regard
it
as
an
article
of
their
faith
that
woman
would
show
herself
not
inferior
in
mental
power
to
man
if
only
she
had
the
chance
of
exercising
that
power
must
find
a
surer
foundation
for
their
opinion
than
this
theory
of
the
centuries
of
oppression
under
which
as
they
allege
the
female
sex
has
laboured
we
now
come
to
the
important
question
of
morbid
and
pathological
mental
conditions
to
which
the
female
sex
is
liable
and
which
are
usually
connected
with
those
constitutional
disturbances
of
the
nervous
system
which
pass
under
the
name
of
the
word
is
as
everyone
knows
derived
from
and
was
uniformly
regarded
by
the
ancients
as
directly
due
to
disease
of
the
this
view
maintaining
itself
in
modern
medicine
up
till
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
thus
dr
mason
good
in
his
study
of
medicine
vol
an
important
medical
during
the
earlier
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
says
with
a
morbid
condition
of
this
organ
hysteria
is
in
many
instances
very
closely
connected
though
it
is
going
too
far
to
say
that
it
is
always
dependent
upon
such
condition
for
we
meet
with
instances
occasionally
in
which
no
possible
connexion
can
be
traced
between
the
disease
and
the
organ
etc
this
is
perhaps
the
first
appearance
certainly
in
english
medicine
of
doubts
being
thrown
on
the
uterine
origin
of
the
various
symptoms
grouped
under
the
general
term
towards
the
latter
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
prevalent
view
tended
more
and
more
to
dissociate
hysteria
from
uterine
trouble
lately
however
some
eminent
pathologists
have
shown
a
tendency
to
qualify
the
terms
of
the
latter
view
thus
dr
thomas
stevenson
in
admits
that
it
hysteria
frequently
accompanies
a
morbid
state
of
the
uterus
especially
where
inflammation
and
congestion
are
present
and
it
is
not
an
uncommon
thing
for
surgeons
at
the
present
time
to
remove
the
ovaries
in
obstinate
cases
of
hysteria
on
the
other
hand
dr
thomas
buzzard
in
an
article
on
the
subject
in
quain
s
of
states
that
hysteria
is
only
exceptionally
found
in
women
suffering
from
diseases
of
the
genital
organs
and
its
relation
to
uterine
and
ovarian
disturbances
is
probably
neither
more
nor
less
than
that
which
pertains
to
the
other
affections
of
the
nervous
system
which
may
occur
without
any
obvious
material
cause
dr
thomas
luff
on
forensic
medicine
shows
that
the
derangements
of
the
reproductive
functions
are
undoubtedly
the
cause
of
various
attacks
of
insanity
in
the
female
dr
savage
in
his
book
on
neuroses
says
that
acute
mania
in
women
occurs
most
frequently
at
the
period
of
adult
and
mature
life
and
may
occasionally
take
place
at
either
extreme
age
acute
mania
sometimes
occurs
at
the
suppression
of
the
the
same
is
true
of
melancholia
and
other
pathological
mental
symptoms
dr
luff
states
that
acute
mania
may
replace
hysteria
that
this
happens
at
periods
such
as
puberty
change
of
life
and
menstruation
these
patients
in
the
intervals
of
their
attacks
are
often
morbidly
irritable
or
excitable
but
as
time
goes
on
their
energies
become
diminished
and
their
emotions
blunted
forensic
medicine
ii
such
patients
are
often
seized
with
a
desire
to
commit
violence
they
are
often
very
mischievous
tearing
up
clothes
breaking
windows
etc
in
this
mental
disorder
the
patient
is
driven
by
a
morbid
and
uncontrollable
impulse
to
such
acts
it
is
not
accompanied
by
delusions
and
frequently
no
change
will
have
been
noticed
in
the
individual
prior
to
the
commission
of
the
act
and
consequently
says
dr
luff
there
is
much
difference
of
opinion
as
to
the
responsibility
of
the
individual
ii
among
the
acts
spoken
of
dr
luff
mentions
a
propensity
to
set
fire
to
furniture
houses
etc
all
this
though
written
in
might
serve
as
a
commentary
on
the
suffragette
agitation
of
recent
years
the
renowned
french
professor
dr
paul
janet
les
hysteriques
thus
defined
hysteria
hysteria
is
a
mental
affection
belonging
to
the
large
group
of
diseases
due
to
cerebral
weakness
and
debility
its
physical
symptoms
are
somewhat
indefinite
consisting
chiefly
in
a
general
diminution
of
nutrition
it
is
largely
characterised
by
moral
symptoms
chief
of
which
is
an
impairment
of
the
faculty
of
psychological
synthesis
an
abolition
and
a
contraction
of
the
field
of
consciousness
this
manifests
itself
in
a
peculiar
manner
and
by
a
certain
number
of
elementary
phenomena
thus
sensations
and
images
are
no
longer
perceived
and
appear
to
be
blotted
out
from
the
individual
perception
a
tendency
which
results
in
their
persistent
and
complete
separation
from
the
personality
in
some
cases
and
in
the
formation
of
many
independent
groups
this
series
of
psychological
facts
alternate
the
one
with
the
other
or
finally
this
synthetic
defect
favours
the
formation
of
certain
independent
ideas
which
develop
complete
in
themselves
and
unattached
from
the
control
of
the
consciousness
of
the
personality
these
ideas
show
themselves
in
affections
possessing
very
various
and
unique
according
to
mr
millar
vol
hysteria
is
that
condition
in
which
there
is
imagination
imitation
or
exaggeration
it
occurs
mostly
in
females
and
persons
of
nervous
temperament
and
is
due
to
some
nervous
derangement
which
may
or
may
not
be
sir
james
paget
clinical
lectures
on
mimicry
says
also
that
hysterical
patients
are
mostly
females
of
nervous
temperament
they
think
of
themselves
constantly
are
fond
of
telling
everyone
of
their
troubles
and
thus
court
sympathy
for
which
they
have
a
morbid
craving
will
power
is
deficient
in
one
direction
though
some
have
it
very
strongly
where
their
interests
are
he
thinks
the
term
hysteria
in
the
sense
now
employed
incorrect
and
would
substitute
the
will
should
be
controlled
by
the
intellect
observes
dr
still
of
king
s
college
hospital
rather
than
by
the
emotions
and
the
lack
of
this
control
appears
to
be
at
the
root
of
some
at
least
of
the
manifestations
of
dr
thomas
buzzard
above
mentioned
thus
summarises
the
mental
symptoms
the
intelligence
may
be
apparently
of
good
quality
the
patient
evincing
sometimes
remarkable
quickness
of
apprehension
but
carefully
tested
it
is
found
to
be
wanting
in
the
essentials
of
the
highest
class
of
mental
power
the
memory
may
be
good
but
the
judgment
is
weak
and
the
ability
to
concentrate
the
attention
for
any
length
of
time
upon
a
subject
is
absent
so
also
regard
for
accuracy
and
the
energy
necessary
to
ensure
it
in
any
work
that
is
undertaken
is
deficient
the
emotions
are
excited
with
undue
readiness
and
when
aroused
are
incapable
of
control
tears
are
occasioned
not
only
by
pathetic
ideas
but
by
ridiculous
subjects
and
peals
of
laughter
may
incongruously
greet
some
tragic
announcement
or
the
converse
may
take
place
the
ordinary
signs
of
emotion
may
be
absent
and
replaced
by
an
attack
of
syncope
convulsion
pain
or
paralysis
perhaps
more
constant
than
any
other
phenomenon
in
hysteria
is
a
pronounced
desire
for
the
sympathy
and
interest
of
others
this
is
evidently
only
one
of
the
most
characteristic
qualities
of
femininity
uncontrolled
by
the
action
of
the
higher
nervous
centres
which
in
a
healthy
state
keep
it
in
subjection
there
is
very
frequently
not
only
a
deficient
regard
for
truthfulness
but
a
proneness
to
active
deception
and
dishonesty
so
common
is
this
that
the
various
phases
of
hysteria
are
often
assumed
to
be
simple
examples
of
voluntary
simulation
and
the
title
of
disease
refused
to
the
condition
but
it
seems
more
reasonable
to
refer
the
symptoms
to
impairment
of
the
highly
complex
nervous
processes
which
form
the
physiological
side
of
the
moral
faculties
quain
s
of
it
is
not
uncommon
to
find
hysteria
in
females
accompanied
by
an
utter
indifference
and
insensibility
to
sexual
relations
premature
cessation
of
ovulation
is
a
frequent
determining
cause
in
cases
where
the
ovaries
are
absent
the
change
from
girl
to
woman
which
normally
takes
place
at
puberty
does
not
occur
the
girl
grows
but
does
not
develop
a
masculine
appearance
supervenes
the
voice
becomes
manly
and
harsh
sexual
passion
is
absent
the
health
remains
good
the
most
violent
instances
of
hysteria
are
in
young
women
of
the
most
robust
and
masculine
constitution

hysteria
is
in
common
with
other
nervous
disorders
essentially
a
hereditary
malady
and
briquet
traité
de
l
hysterie
gives
statistics
to
show
that
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
hysterical
parents
have
hysterical
children
dr
paul
sainton
of
the
faculty
of
medicine
paris
says
the
appearance
of
a
symptom
of
hysteria
generally
proves
that
the
malady
has
already
existed
for
some
time
though
latent
the
name
of
a
provocative
agent
of
hysteria
is
given
to
any
circumstance
which
suddenly
reveals
the
malady
but
the
real
cause
of
the
disorder
is
a
hereditary
disposition
if
the
real
cause
is
unique
the
provocative
agents
are
numberless
the
moral
emotions
grief
fright
anger
and
other
psychic
disturbances
are
the
most
frequent
causes
of
hysterical
affections
and
in
every
walk
of
life
subjects
are
equally
liable
to
hysteria
may
appear
at
any
age
it
is
common
with
children
especially
during
the
five
or
six
years
preceding
puberty
of
cases
under
twelve
years
which
came
under
dr

notice

in

over

hysteria
in
women
is
most
frequent
between
the
ages
of
fifteen
and
thirty
and
most
frequently
of
all
between
fifteen
and
twenty
as
a
rule
there
is
a
tendency
to
cessation
after
the
it
frequently
happens
however
that
the
disease
is
continued
into
an
advanced
period
of
life
there
is
a
constant
change
says
professor
albert
moll
das
nervöse
weib
from
a
cheerful
to
a
depressed
mood
from
being
free
and
merry
the
woman
in
a
short
time
becomes
sulky
and
sad
while
a
moment
before
she
was
capable
of
entertaining
a
whole
company
without
pause
talking
to
each
member
about
that
which
interested
him
shortly
afterwards
she
does
not
speak
a
word
more
i
may
mention
the
example
of
the
refusal
of
a
new
hat
as
being
capable
of
converting
the
most
lively
mood
into
its
opposite
the
weakness
of
will
shows
itself
here
in
that
the
nervous
woman
by
nervous
dr
moll
means
what
is
commonly
termed
hysterical
can
not
like
the
normal
one
command
the
expression
of
her
emotions
she
can
laugh
uninterruptedly
over
the
most
indifferent
matter
until
she
falls
into
veritable
laughing
fits
the
crying
fits
which
we
sometimes
observe
belong
to
the
same
category
when
the
nervous
woman
is
excited
about
anything
she
exhibits
outbreaks
of
fury
wanting
all
the
characteristics
of
womanhood
and
she
is
not
able
to
prevent
these
emotional
outbursts
in
the
same
way
just
as
the
emotions
weaken
the
will
and
the
woman
can
not
suppress
this
or
that
action
it
is
noticeable
in
many
nervous
women
that
quite
independently
of
these
emotions
there
is
a
tendency
to
continuous
alterations
in
their
way
of
acting
it
has
been
noticed
as
characteristic
of
many
nervous
persons
that
their
only
consistency
lies
in
their
inconsistency
but
this
must
in
no
way
be
applied
to
all
nervous
persons
on
this
disposition
discoverable
in
the
nature
of
so
many
nervous
women
rests
the
craving
for
change
as
manifested
in
the
continual
search
for
new
pleasures
theatres
concerts
parties
tours
and
other
things
things
that
to
the
normal
woman
are
indifferent
or
to
which
she
has
in
a
sense
accustomed
herself
are
to
the
nervous
woman
a
source
of
constant
worry
although
she
may
perfectly
well
know
that
the
circumstances
of
herself
and
her
husband
are
the
most
brilliant
and
that
it
is
unnecessary
for
her
to
trouble
herself
in
the
least
about
her
material
position
as
regards
the
future
nevertheless
the
idea
of
financial
ruin
constantly
troubles
her
thus
if
she
is
a
millionaire
s
wife
she
never
escapes
from
constant
worry
similarly
the
nervous
woman
creates
troubles
out
of
things
that
are
unavoidable
if
in
the
course
of
years
she
gets
more
wrinkles
and
her
attraction
for
man
diminishes
this
may
easily
become
a
source
of
lasting
sorrow
for
the
nervous
we
now
have
to
consider
a
point
which
is
being
continually
urged
by
feminists
in
the
present
day
when
confronted
with
the
pathological
mental
symptoms
so
commonly
observed
in
women
which
are
usually
regarded
as
having
their
origin
in
hysteria
we
often
hear
it
said
by
feminists
in
answer
to
arguments
based
on
the
above
fact
oh
but
men
can
also
suffer
from
hysteria
in
england
says
dr
buzzard
hysteria
is
comparatively
rarely
met
with
in
males
the
female
sex
being
much
more
prone
to
the
the
proportion
of
males
to
females
in
hysteria
is
according
to
dr
pitrè
clinical
essay
on
hysteria
to
according
to
bodensheim
to
and
according
to
briquet
to
the
author
of
the
article
on
hysteria
in
encyclopædia
edition
also
gives
to
as
the
numerical
proportion
between
male
and
female
cases
dr
pitrè
in
the
work
above
cited
gives
per
cent
of
cases
of
convulsions
in
women
as
against
in
men
but
in
all
this
under
the
concept
hysteria
are
included
and
indeed
chiefly
referred
to
various
physical
symptoms
of
a
convulsive
and
epileptic
character
which
are
quite
distinct
from
the
mental
conditions
rightly
or
wrongly
connected
or
even
identified
with
hysteria
in
the
popular
mind
and
by
many
medical
authorities
but
even
as
regards
hysteria
in
the
former
sense
of
the
word
a
sharp
line
of
distinction
based
on
a
diagnosis
of
cases
was
long
ago
drawn
by
medical
men
between
and
and
in
the
present
day
eminent
dr
bernard
deny
that
the
symptoms
occasionally
diagnosed
as
hysteria
in
men
are
identical
with
or
due
to
the
same
causes
as
the
somewhat
similar
conditions
known
in
women
under
the
name
after
all
this
whole
question
in
its
broader
bearings
is
more
a
question
of
observation
than
one
for
medical
experts
what
we
are
here
chiefly
concerned
with
as
hysteria
in
accordance
with
popular
usage
of
the
term
are
certain
pathological
mental
symptoms
in
women
open
to
everybody
s
observation
and
denied
by
no
one
unprejudiced
by
feminist
views
every
impartial
person
has
only
to
cast
his
eye
round
his
female
acquaintance
and
to
recall
the
various
women
of
all
classes
conditions
and
nationalities
that
he
may
have
come
in
contact
with
in
the
course
of
his
life
to
recognise
those
symptoms
of
mental
instability
commonly
called
hysterical
as
obtaining
in
at
least
a
proportion
of
one
to
every
four
or
five
women
he
has
known
in
a
marked
and
unmistakable
degree
the
proportion
given
is
in
fact
stated
in
an
official
report
to
the
prussian
government
issued
some
ten
years
back
as
that
noticeable
among
female
clerks
post
office
servants
and
other
women
employed
in
the
prussian
civil
service
certainly
as
regards
women
in
general
the
observation
of
the
present
writer
and
others
whom
he
has
questioned
on
the
subject
would
seem
to
indicate
that
the
proportions
given
in
the
prussian
civil
service
report
as
regards
the
number
of
women
afflicted
in
this
way
are
rather
under
than
over
stated
there
are
many
medical
men
who
aver
that
no
woman
is
entirely
free
from
such
symptoms
at
least
immediately
before
and
during
the
menstrual
period
the
head
surgeon
at
a
london
hospital
informed
a
friend
of
mine
that
he
could
always
tell
when
this
period
was
on
or
approaching
with
his
nurses
by
the
mental
change
which
came
over
them
the
insanities
mentioned
above
are
the
extremes
there
are
mental
disturbances
of
less
severity
constantly
occurring
which
are
connected
with
the
regular
menstrual
period
as
well
as
with
disordered
menstruation
with
pregnancy
with
parturition
with
lactation
and
especially
with
the
change
of
life
now
these
pathological
symptoms
noticeable
in
a
slight
and
more
or
less
unimportant
degree
in
the
vast
majority
if
not
indeed
in
all
women
and
in
a
marked
pathological
degree
in
a
large
proportion
of
women
it
is
scarcely
too
much
to
say
do
not
occur
at
all
in
men
i
have
indeed
known
i
think
two
men
and
only
two
in
the
course
of
my
life
exhibiting
mental
symptoms
analogous
to
those
commonly
called
hysterical
in
women
on
the
other
hand
my
own
experience
and
it
is
not
alone
is
that
very
few
women
with
whom
i
have
come
into
more
or
less
frequent
contact
socially
or
otherwise
have
not
at
times
shown
the
symptoms
referred
to
in
a
marked
degree
if
therefore
we
are
to
admit
the
bare
possibility
of
men
being
afflicted
in
a
similar
way
it
must
be
conceded
that
such
cases
represent
such
as
to
be
negligible
for
practical
purposes
a
curious
thing
in
pronounced
examples
of
this
mental
instability
in
women
is
that
the
symptoms
are
often
so
very
similar
in
women
of
quite
different
birth
surroundings
and
nationality
i
can
recall
at
the
present
moment
three
cases
each
different
as
regards
birth
class
and
in
one
case
nationality
and
yet
who
are
liable
to
develop
the
same
symptoms
under
the
influence
of
quite
similar
but
it
seems
hardly
necessary
to
labour
the
point
in
question
at
greater
length
the
whole
experience
of
mankind
since
the
dawn
of
written
records
confirmed
by
as
above
said
that
of
every
living
person
not
specially
committed
to
the
theories
of
modern
feminism
bears
witness
alike
to
the
prevalence
of
what
we
may
term
the
hysterical
mind
in
woman
and
to
her
general
mental
frailty
it
is
not
for
nothing
that
women
and
children
have
always
been
classed
together
this
view
based
as
it
is
on
the
unanimous
experience
of
mankind
and
confirmed
by
the
observation
of
all
independent
persons
has
i
repeat
not
been
challenged
before
the
appearance
of
the
present
feminist
movement
and
hardly
by
anyone
outside
the
ranks
of
that
movement
it
is
not
proposed
here
to
dilate
at
length
on
the
fact
often
before
insisted
upon
of
the
absence
throughout
history
of
the
signs
of
genius
and
with
a
few
exceptions
of
conspicuous
talent
in
the
human
female
in
art
science
literature
invention
or
the
fact
is
incontestable
and
if
it
be
argued
that
this
absence
in
women
of
genius
or
even
of
a
high
degree
of
talent
is
no
proof
of
the
inferiority
of
the
average
woman
to
the
average
man
the
answer
is
obvious
apart
from
conclusive
proof
the
fact
of
the
existence
in
all
periods
of
civilisation
and
even
under
the
higher
barbarism
of
exceptionally
gifted
men
and
never
of
a
correspondingly
gifted
woman
does
undoubtedly
afford
an
indication
of
inferiority
of
the
average
woman
as
regards
the
average
man
from
the
height
of
the
mountain
peaks
we
may
other
things
equal
undoubtedly
conclude
the
existence
of
a
tableland
beneath
them
in
the
same
tract
of
country
whence
they
arise
i
have
already
in
the
present
chapter
besides
elsewhere
referred
to
the
fallacy
that
intellectual
or
other
fundamental
inferiority
in
woman
existing
at
the
present
day
is
traceable
to
any
alleged
repression
in
the
past
since
weissmann
and
his
denial
of
transmission
of
acquired
characteristics
apart
assuming
for
the
sake
of
the
argument
such
repression
to
have
really
attained
the
extent
alleged
and
its
effects
to
have
been
transmitted
to
future
generations
it
is
against
all
the
laws
of
heredity
that
such
transmission
should
have
taken
place
the
female
line
as
is
contended
by
the
advocates
of
this
theory
referring
to
this
point
herbert
spencer
has
expressed
the
conviction
of
most
scientific
thinkers
on
the
subject
when
he
declares
a
difference
between
the
mental
powers
of
men
and
women
to
result
from
a
physiological
necessity
and
that
no
amount
of
culture
can
obliterate
he
further
observes
the
passages
occur
in
a
letter
of
his
to
john
stuart
mill
that
the
relative
deficiency
of
the
female
mind
is
in
just
those
most
complex
faculties
intellectual
and
moral
which
have
political
action
for
their
one
of
the
points
as
regards
the
inferiority
of
women
which
feminists
are
willing
and
even
eager
to
concede
and
it
is
the
only
point
of
which
this
can
be
said
is
that
of
physical
weakness
the
reason
why
they
should
be
particularly
anxious
to
emphasise
this
deficiency
in
the
sex
is
not
difficult
to
discern
it
is
the
only
possible
semblance
of
an
argument
which
can
be
plausibly
brought
forward
to
justify
female
privileges
in
certain
directions
it
does
not
really
do
so
but
it
is
the
sole
pretext
which
they
can
adduce
with
any
show
of
reason
at
all
now
it
may
be
observed
that
the
general
frailty
of
woman
would
militate
against
their
own
dogma
of
the
intellectual
equality
between
the
sexes
that
this
physical
weakness
is
more
particularly
a
muscular
weakness
since
constitutionally
the
organism
of
the
human
female
has
enormous
power
of
resistance
and
resilience
in
general
far
greater
than
that
of
man
see
below
pp
it
is
a
matter
of
common
observation
that
the
average
woman
can
pass
through
strains
and
recover
in
a
way
few
men
can
do
but
as
we
shall
have
occasion
to
revert
to
these
two
points
at
greater
length
later
on
we
refrain
from
saying
more
here
how
then
after
consideration
shall
we
judge
of
the
feminist
thesis
affirmed
and
reaffirmed
insisted
upon
by
so
many
as
an
incontrovertible
axiom
that
woman
is
the
equal
intellectually
and
morally
if
not
physically
of
man
surely
that
it
has
all
the
characteristics
of
a
true
dogma
its
votaries
might
well
say
with
tertullian
quia
it
contradicts
the
whole
experience
of
mankind
in
the
past
it
is
refuted
by
all
impartial
observation
in
the
present
the
facts
which
undermine
it
are
seriously
denied
by
none
save
those
committed
to
the
dogma
in
question
like
all
dogmas
it
is
supported
by
in
this
case
the
bluff
is
to
the
effect
that
it
is
the
part
mark
business
lot
as
the
latin
grammars
of
our
youth
would
have
had
it
of
the
advanced
man
who
considers
himself
up
to
date
and
not
early
victorian
to
regard
it
as
unchallengeable
theological
dogmas
are
backed
up
by
the
bluff
of
authority
either
of
scriptures
or
of
churches
this
dogma
of
the
feminist
cult
is
not
vouchsafed
by
the
authority
of
a
communion
of
saints
but
by
that
of
the
communion
of
advanced
persons
up
to
date
unfortunately
dogma
does
not
sit
so
well
upon
the
community
of
advanced
persons
up
to
otherwise
profess
to
and
generally
do
bring
the
tenets
they
hold
to
the
bar
of
reason
and
critical
it
does
on
a
church
or
community
of
saints
who
suppose
themselves
to
be
individually
or
collectively
in
communication
with
wisdom
from
on
high
be
this
as
it
may
the
advanced
man
who
would
claim
to
be
up
to
date
has
to
swallow
this
dogma
and
digest
it
as
best
he
can
he
may
secretly
it
is
true
spew
it
out
of
his
mouth
but
in
public
at
least
he
must
make
a
pretence
of
accepting
it
without
flinching
chapter
iii
the
crusade
we
have
already
pointed
out
that
modern
feminism
has
two
sides
or
aspects
the
first
formulates
definite
political
juridical
and
economic
demands
on
the
grounds
of
justice
equity
equality
and
so
forth
as
general
principles
the
second
does
not
formulate
in
so
many
words
definite
demands
as
general
principles
but
seems
to
exploit
the
traditional
notions
of
chivalry
based
on
male
sex
sentiment
in
favour
of
according
women
special
privileges
on
the
ground
of
their
sex
in
the
law
and
still
more
in
the
administration
of
the
law
for
the
sake
of
brevity
we
call
the
first
for
although
its
demands
are
not
confined
to
the
political
sphere
it
is
first
and
foremost
a
political
movement
and
its
typical
claim
at
the
present
time
the
franchise
is
a
purely
political
one
and
the
second
inasmuch
as
it
commonly
does
not
profess
to
be
based
on
any
general
principle
whatever
whether
of
equity
or
otherwise
but
relies
exclusively
on
the
traditional
and
conventional
sex
sentiment
of
man
towards
woman
it
may
be
here
premised
that
most
political
feminists
however
much
they
may
refuse
to
admit
it
are
at
heart
also
sentimental
feminists
sentimental
feminists
on
the
other
hand
are
not
invariably
political
feminists
although
the
majority
of
them
undoubtedly
are
so
to
a
greater
or
lesser
extent
logically
as
we
shall
have
occasion
to
insist
upon
later
on
the
principles
professedly
at
the
root
of
political
feminism
are
in
flagrant
contradiction
with
any
that
can
justify
sentimental
feminism
now
both
the
orders
of
feminism
referred
to
have
been
active
for
more
than
a
generation
past
in
fomenting
a
crusade
against
the
male
crusade
their
efforts
have
been
largely
successful
owing
to
a
fact
to
which
attention
has
perhaps
not
enough
been
called
in
the
case
of
other
classes
or
bodies
of
persons
having
community
of
interests
this
common
interest
invariably
interprets
itself
in
a
sense
of
class
caste
or
race
solidarity
the
class
or
caste
has
a
certain
de
in
its
own
interest
the
whole
of
history
largely
turns
on
the
conflict
of
economic
classes
based
on
a
common
feeling
obtaining
between
members
of
the
respective
classes
on
a
small
scale
we
see
the
same
thing
in
the
solidarity
of
a
particular
trade
or
profession
but
it
is
unnecessary
to
do
more
than
call
attention
here
to
this
fundamental
sociological
law
upon
which
alike
the
class
struggles
of
history
and
of
modern
times
the
patriotism
of
states
from
the
of
the
ancient
world
to
the
national
state
of
the
modern
world
is
based
now
note
the
peculiar
manner
in
which
this
law
manifests
itself
in
the
sex
question
of
the
present
day
while
modern
feminism
has
succeeded
in
establishing
a
powerful
amongst
a
large
section
of
women
as
against
men
there
is
not
only
no
of
men
as
against
women
but
on
the
contrary
the
prevalence
of
an
altogether
opposed
sentiment
men
hate
their
in
their
capacity
of
male
persons
in
any
conflict
of
interests
between
a
man
and
a
woman
male
public
opinion
often
in
defiance
of
the
most
obvious
considerations
of
equity
sides
with
the
woman
and
glories
in
doing
so
here
we
seem
to
have
a
very
flagrant
contradiction
with
as
has
already
been
said
one
of
the
most
fundamental
sociological
laws
the
explanations
of
the
phenomena
in
question
are
of
course
ready
to
hand
of
chivalry
feelings
perhaps
inherited
dating
possibly
back
to
the
prehuman
stage
of
man
s
evolution
derived
from
the
competition
of
the
male
with
his
for
the
possession
of
the
coveted
female
etc
these
explanations
may
have
a
measure
of
validity
but
i
must
confess
they
are
to
me
scarcely
adequate
to
account
for
the
intense
hatred
which
the
large
section
of
men
seem
to
entertain
towards
their
in
the
world
of
and
their
eagerness
to
champion
the
female
in
the
sex
war
which
the
woman
s
sex
union
as
it
has
been
termed
has
declared
of
recent
years
whatever
may
be
the
explanation
and
i
confess
i
can
not
find
one
completely
satisfactory
the
fact
remains
a
woman
s
movement
unassisted
by
man
still
more
if
opposed
energetically
by
the
public
opinion
of
a
solid
phalanx
of
the
manhood
of
any
country
could
not
possibly
make
any
headway
as
it
is
we
see
the
legislature
judges
juries
parsons
specially
those
of
the
nonconformist
persuasion
all
vie
with
one
another
in
denouncing
the
villainy
and
baseness
of
the
male
person
and
ever
devising
ways
and
means
to
make
his
life
hard
for
him
to
these
are
joined
a
host
of
literary
men
and
journalists
of
varying
degrees
of
reputation
who
contribute
their
quota
to
the
stream
of
in
the
shape
of
novels
storiettes
essays
and
articles
the
design
of
which
is
to
paint
man
as
a
base
contemptible
creature
as
at
once
a
knave
and
an
imbecile
a
bird
of
prey
and
a
sheep
in
wolf
s
clothing
and
all
as
a
foil
to
the
glorious
majesty
of
womanhood
there
are
not
wanting
artists
who
are
pressed
into
this
service
the
picture
of
the
thames
embankment
at
night
of
the
drowned
unfortunate
with
the
angel
s
face
the
lady
and
gentleman
in
evening
dress
who
have
just
got
out
of
their
lady
with
uplifted
hands
bending
over
the
dripping
form
and
the
callous
and
brutal
gentleman
turning
aside
to
light
a
is
a
typical
specimen
of
feminist
didactic
art
by
these
means
which
have
been
carried
on
with
increasing
ardour
for
a
couple
of
generations
past
what
we
may
term
the
cultus
has
been
made
to
flourish
and
to
bear
fruit
till
we
find
nowadays
all
recent
legislation
affecting
the
relations
between
the
sexes
carrying
its
impress
and
the
whole
of
the
judiciary
and
magistracy
acting
as
its
priests
and
ministrants
on
the
subject
of
legislation
i
have
already
written
at
length
elsewhere
but
for
the
sake
of
completeness
i
state
the
case
briefly
here
the
marriage
laws
of
england
are
a
monument
of
feminist
sex
partiality
if
i
may
be
excused
the
paradox
the
partiality
of
the
marriage
laws
begins
with
the
law
relating
to
breach
of
promise
which
as
is
well
known
enables
a
woman
to
punish
a
man
vindictively
for
refusing
to
marry
her
after
having
once
engaged
himself
to
her
i
ought
to
add
and
this
oftentimes
however
good
his
grounds
may
be
for
doing
so
should
the
woman
commit
perjury
in
these
cases
she
is
never
prosecuted
for
the
offence
although
the
law
of
breach
of
promise
exists
also
for
the
man
it
is
well
known
to
be
totally
ineffective
and
practically
a
dead
letter
it
should
be
remarked
that
however
gross
the
misrepresentations
or
undue
influences
on
the
part
of
the
woman
may
have
been
to
induce
the
man
to
marry
her
they
do
not
cause
her
to
lose
her
right
to
compensation
as
for
instance
where
an
experienced
woman
of
the
world
of
thirty
or
forty
entraps
a
boy
scarcely
out
of
his
teens
again
according
to
the
law
of
england
the
right
to
maintenance
accrues
solely
to
the
woman
formerly
this
privilege
was
made
dependent
on
her
cohabitation
with
the
man
and
generally
decent
behaviour
to
him
now
even
these
limitations
cease
to
be
operative
while
the
man
is
liable
to
imprisonment
and
confiscation
of
any
property
he
may
have
a
wife
is
now
at
full
liberty
to
leave
her
husband
while
she
retains
her
right
to
get
her
husband
sent
to
gaol
if
he
refuses
to
maintain
put
the
matter
shortly
the
law
imposes
upon
the
wife
no
legally
enforceable
duties
whatever
her
husband
the
one
thing
which
it
will
enforce
with
iron
vigour
is
the
wife
s
right
of
maintenance
her
husband
in
the
case
of
a
man
of
the
classes
the
man
s
property
is
confiscated
by
the
law
in
favour
of
his
wife
in
the
case
of
a
working
man
the
law
compels
her
husband
to
do
for
her
as
the
feudal
serf
had
to
do
for
his
lord
the
wife
on
the
other
hand
however
wealthy
is
not
compelled
to
give
a
farthing
towards
the
support
of
her
husband
even
though
disabled
by
sickness
or
by
accident
the
single
exception
in
the
latter
case
being
should
he
become
chargeable
to
the
parish
in
which
case
the
wife
would
have
to
pay
the
authorities
a
pauper
s
rate
for
his
maintenance
in
a
word
a
wife
has
complete
possession
and
control
over
any
property
she
may
possess
as
well
as
over
her
earnings
the
husband
on
the
other
hand
is
liable
to
confiscation
of
capitalised
property
or
earnings
at
the
behest
of
the
law
courts
in
favour
of
his
wife
a
wife
may
even
make
her
husband
bankrupt
on
the
ground
of
money
she
alleges
that
she
lent
him
a
husband
on
the
other
hand
has
no
claim
against
his
wife
for
any
money
advanced
since
a
husband
is
supposed
to
and
not
to
his
wife
money
or
other
valuables
the
law
affords
the
wife
a
right
to
commit
torts
against
third
libels
and
husband
alone
being
responsible
and
this
rule
applies
even
although
the
wife
is
living
apart
from
her
husband
who
is
wholly
without
knowledge
of
her
misdeeds
with
the
exception
of
murder
a
wife
is
held
by
the
law
to
be
guiltless
of
practically
any
crime
committed
in
the
presence
of
her
husband
no
man
can
obtain
a
legal
separation
or
divorce
from
his
wife
save
under
the
licensing
act
of
a
police
court
separation
for
habitual
drunkenness
alone
without
a
costly
process
in
the
high
court
every
wife
can
obtain
if
not
a
divorce
at
least
a
legal
separation
by
going
whining
to
the
nearest
police
court
for
a
few
shillings
which
her
husband
of
course
has
to
pay
the
latter
it
is
needless
to
say
is
mulcted
in
alimony
at
the
discretion
of
the
this
discretion
is
very
often
of
a
queer
character
for
the
luckless
husband
thus
a
working
man
earning
only
twenty
shillings
a
week
may
easily
find
himself
in
the
position
of
having
to
pay
from
seven
to
ten
shillings
a
week
to
a
shrew
out
of
his
wages
cf
november
a
creature
of
privilege
also
a
pamphlet
collaboration
entitled
the
legal
subjection
of
twentieth
century
press
reprinted
by
new
age
press
in
cases
where
a
wife
proceeds
to
file
a
petition
for
divorce
the
way
is
once
more
smoothed
for
her
by
the
law
at
the
husband
s
expense
he
has
to
advance
her
money
to
enable
her
to
fight
him
should
the
case
come
on
for
hearing
the
husband
finds
the
scale
still
more
weighted
against
him
every
slander
of
his
wife
is
assumed
to
be
true
until
he
has
proved
its
falsity
the
slightest
act
or
a
word
during
a
moment
of
irritation
even
a
long
time
back
being
twisted
into
what
is
termed
legal
cruelty
even
though
such
has
been
provoked
by
a
long
course
of
ill
treatment
and
neglect
on
the
part
of
the
wife
the
husband
and
his
witnesses
can
be
indicted
for
perjury
for
the
slightest
exaggeration
or
inaccuracy
in
their
statements
while
the
most
calculated
falsity
in
the
evidence
of
the
wife
and
her
witnesses
is
passed
over
not
the
grossest
allegation
on
the
part
of
the
wife
against
the
husband
even
though
proved
in
court
to
be
false
is
sufficient
ground
for
the
husband
to
refuse
to
take
her
back
again
or
from
preventing
the
court
from
confiscating
his
property
if
he
resists
doing
so
knowledge
of
the
unfairness
of
the
court
to
the
husband
as
all
lawyers
are
aware
prevents
a
large
number
of
men
from
defending
divorce
actions
brought
by
their
wives
a
point
should
here
be
mentioned
as
regards
the
action
of
a
husband
for
damages
against
the
seducer
of
his
wife
such
damages
obviously
belong
to
the
husband
as
compensation
for
his
destroyed
home
life
now
these
damages
our
modern
judges
in
their
feminist
zeal
have
converted
into
a
fund
for
endowing
the
adulteress
depriving
the
husband
of
any
compensation
whatever
for
the
wrong
done
him
he
may
not
touch
the
income
derived
from
the
money
awarded
him
by
the
jury
which
is
handed
over
by
the
court
to
his
divorced
wife
it
would
take
us
too
long
to
go
through
all
the
privileges
direct
and
indirect
conferred
by
statute
or
created
by
the
rulings
of
judges
and
the
practice
of
the
courts
in
favour
of
the
wife
against
the
husband
it
is
the
more
unnecessary
to
go
into
them
here
as
they
may
be
found
in
detail
with
illustrative
cases
in
the
aforesaid
pamphlet
in
which
i
collaborated
entitled
the
legal
subjection
of
men
mentioned
in
the
footnote
to
at
this
point
it
may
be
well
to
say
a
word
on
the
one
rule
of
the
divorce
law
which
feminists
are
perennially
trotting
out
as
a
proof
of
the
shocking
injustice
of
the
marriage
law
to
women
that
to
obtain
her
divorce
the
woman
has
to
prove
cruelty
in
addition
to
adultery
against
her
husband
while
in
the
case
of
the
husband
it
is
sufficient
to
prove
adultery
alone
now
to
make
of
this
rule
a
grievance
for
the
woman
is
i
submit
evidence
of
the
destitution
of
the
feminist
case
in
default
of
any
real
injustice
pressing
on
the
woman
the
feminist
is
constrained
to
make
as
much
capital
as
possible
out
of
the
merest
semblance
of
a
grievance
he
can
lay
his
hand
on
the
reasons
for
this
distinction
which
the
law
draws
between
the
husband
and
the
wife
it
is
obvious
enough
are
perfectly
well
grounded
it
is
based
mainly
on
the
simple
fact
that
while
a
woman
by
her
adultery
may
foist
upon
her
husband
a
bastard
which
he
will
be
compelled
by
law
to
support
as
his
own
child
in
the
husband
s
case
of
having
an
illegitimate
child
the
wife
and
her
property
are
not
affected
now
in
a
society
such
as
ours
is
based
upon
private
it
is
only
natural
i
submit
that
the
law
should
take
account
of
this
fact
but
not
only
is
this
rule
of
law
almost
certainly
doomed
to
repeal
in
the
near
future
but
in
even
the
present
day
while
it
still
nominally
exists
it
is
practically
a
dead
letter
in
the
divorce
court
since
any
trivial
act
of
which
the
wife
chooses
to
complain
is
strained
by
the
court
into
evidence
of
cruelty
in
the
legal
and
technical
sense
as
the
matter
stands
the
practical
effect
of
the
rule
is
a
much
greater
injustice
to
the
husband
than
to
the
wife
since
the
former
often
finds
himself
convicted
of
cruelty
which
is
virtually
nothing
at
all
in
order
that
the
wife
s
petition
may
be
granted
and
which
is
often
made
the
excuse
by
feminist
judges
for
depriving
the
husband
of
the
custody
of
his
children
misconduct
on
the
wife
s
part
or
neglect
of
husband
and
children
does
not
weigh
with
the
court
which
will
not
on
that
ground
grant
relief
to
the
husband
from
his
obligation
for
maintenance
etc
on
the
other
hand
neglect
of
the
wife
by
the
husband
is
made
a
ground
for
judicial
separation
with
the
usual
etc
thus
as
it
has
been
put
between
the
upper
and
the
nether
millstone
cruelty
on
the
one
hand
neglect
on
the
other
the
unhappy
husband
can
be
legally
ground
to
pieces
whether
he
does
anything
or
whether
he
does
personal
violence
on
the
part
of
the
husband
is
severely
punished
on
the
part
of
a
wife
she
will
be
let
off
with
impunity
even
if
she
should
in
an
extreme
case
be
imprisoned
the
husband
if
a
poor
man
on
her
release
will
be
compelled
to
take
her
back
to
live
with
him
the
case
came
under
the
notice
of
the
writer
a
few
years
ago
in
which
a
humane
magistrate
was
constrained
to
let
off
a
woman
who
had
nearly
murdered
a
husband
on
the
condition
of
her
graciously
consenting
to
a
separation
but
she
had
presumably
still
to
be
supported
by
her
victim
the
decision
in
the
notorious
jackson
case
precluded
the
husband
from
compelling
his
wife
to
obey
an
order
of
the
court
for
the
restitution
of
conjugal
rights
the
persistent
feminist
tendency
of
all
is
illustrated
by
a
decision
of
the
house
of
lords
in
in
reference
to
the
law
of
scotland
constituting
desertion
for
four
years
a
ground
for
a
divorce
with
the
right
of
remarriage
here
divorce
was
refused
to
a
man
whose
wife
had
left
him
for
four
years
and
taken
her
child
with
her
the
law
lords
justified
their
own
interpretation
of
the
law
on
the
ground
that
the
man
did
not
really
want
her
to
come
back
but
inasmuch
as
this
plea
can
be
started
in
every
case
where
it
can
not
be
proved
that
the
husband
had
absolutely
grovelled
before
his
wife
imploring
her
to
return
and
possibly
even
the
sincerity
even
of
this
grovelling
might
conceivably
be
called
in
is
clear
that
the
decision
practically
rendered
this
old
scottish
law
inoperative
for
the
husband
as
regards
the
offence
of
bigamy
for
which
a
man
commonly
receives
a
heavy
sentence
of
penal
servitude
i
think
i
may
venture
to
state
without
risking
contradiction
that
no
woman
during
recent
years
has
been
imprisoned
for
this
offence
the

conferring
distinct
privileges
upon
married
women
as
to
the
control
of

the

sir
lindley
is
reported
to
have
said
the
authorities
showed
that
a
married
woman
could
not
by
hook
or
by
by
her
own
herself
of
restraint
upon
anticipation
he
would
say
nothing
as
to
the
policy
of
the
law
but
it
had
been
affirmed
by
the
married
woman
s
property
act
the
act
of
above
referred
to
and
the
result
was
that
a
married
woman
could
play
fast
and
loose
to
an
extent
to
which
no
other
person
a
male
person
it
has
indeed
been
held
to
such
a
length
does
the
law
extend
its
protection
and
privileges
to
the
female
that
even
the
concealment
by
a
wife
from
the
husband
at
the
time
of
marriage
that
she
was
then
pregnant
by
another
man
was
no
ground
for
declaring
the
marriage
null
and
void
the
above
may
be
taken
as
a
fair
although
by
no
means
an
exhaustive
statement
of
the
present
condition
of
the
civil
law
as
regards
the
relation
of
husband
and
wife
we
will
now
pass
on
to
the
consideration
of
the
relative
incidence
of
the
criminal
law
on
the
two
sexes
we
will
begin
with
the
crime
of
murder
the
law
of
murder
is
still
ostensibly
the
same
for
both
sexes
but
in
effect
the
application
of
its
provisions
in
the
two
cases
is
markedly
different
as
however
these
differences
lie
as
just
stated
not
in
the
law
itself
but
rather
in
its
administration
we
can
only
give
in
this
place
where
we
are
dealing
with
the
principles
of
law
rather
than
with
their
application
a
general
formula
of
the
mode
in
which
the
administration
of
the
law
of
murder
proceeds
which
briefly
stated
is
as
follows
the
evidence
even
to
secure
conviction
in
the
case
of
a
woman
must
be
many
times
stronger
than
that
which
would
suffice
to
hang
a
man
should
a
conviction
be
obtained
the
death
penalty
though
pronounced
is
not
given
effect
to
the
female
prisoner
being
almost
invariably
reprieved
in
most
cases
where
there
is
conviction
at
all
it
is
for
manslaughter
and
not
for
murder
when
a
light
or
almost
nominal
sentence
is
passed
cases
confirming
what
is
here
said
will
be
given
later
on
there
is
one
point
however
to
be
observed
here
and
that
is
the
crushing
incidence
of
the
law
of
libel
this
means
that
no
case
of
any
woman
however
notoriously
guilty
on
the
evidence
can
be
quoted
after
she
has
been
acquitted
by
a
feminist
jury
as
the
law
holds
such
to
be
innocent
and
provides
them
with
a
remedy
in
a
libel
action
now
seeing
that
most
women
accused
of
murder
are
acquitted
irrespective
of
the
evidence
it
is
clear
that
the
writer
is
fatally
handicapped
so
far
as
confirmation
of
his
thesis
by
cases
is
concerned
women
are
to
all
intents
and
purposes
allowed
to
harass
men
when
they
conceive
they
have
a
grievance
at
their
own
sweet
will
the
magistrate
usually
telling
their
victim
that
he
can
not
interfere
in
the
opposite
case
that
of
a
man
harassing
a
woman
the
latter
has
invariably
to
find
sureties
for
his
future
good
behaviour
or
else
go
to
gaol
one
of
the
most
infamous
enactments
indicative
of
feminist
sex
bias
is
the
criminal
law
amendment
act
of
the
act
itself
was
led
up
to
with
the
usual
effect
by
an
unscrupulous
newspaper
agitation
in
the
feminist
and
puritan
interest
designed
to
create
a
panic
in
the
public
mind
under
the
influence
of
which
legislation
of
this
description
can
generally
be
rushed
through
parliament
the
reckless
disregard
of
the
commonest
principles
of
justice
and
of
this
abominable
statute
may
be
seen
in
the
shameless
sex
privilege
it
accords
the
female
in
the
matter
of
seduction
under
its
provisions
a
boy
of
fourteen
years
can
be
prosecuted
and
sent
to
gaol
for
an
offence
to
which
he
has
been
instigated
by
a
girl
just
under
sixteen
years
whom
the
law
of
course
on
the
basis
of
the
aforesaid
sex
privilege
holds
guiltless
the
outrageous
infamy
of
this
provision
is
especially
apparent
when
we
consider
the
greater
precocity
of
the
average
girl
as
compared
with
the
average
boy
of
this
age
we
come
now
to
the
latest
piece
of
legislation
the
slave
trade
act
of
criminal
law
amendment
act
geo
this
statute
was
as
usual
rushed
through
the
legislature
on
the
wave
of
factitious
public
excitement
organised
for
the
purpose
and
backed
up
by
the
usual
faked
statements
and
exaggerated
allegations
the
whole
matter
being
three
parts
bogus
and
deliberate
lying
the
alleged
dangers
of
the
unprotected
female
were
for
the
object
of
the
agitation
purposely
exaggerated
in
the
proverbial
proportion
of
the
mountain
to
the
molehill
but
as
regards
many
of
those
most
eager
in
promoting
this
piece
of
legislation
there
were
probably
special
psychological
reasons
to
account
for
their
attitude
the
special
features
of
the
bill
the
act
in
question
are
increased
powers
given
to
the
police
in
the
matter
of
arrest
on
suspicion
and
the
flogging
clauses
up
till
now
the
flogging
of
garrotters
was
justified
against
opponents
by
its
upholders
on
the
ground
of
the
peculiarly
brutal
nature
of
the
offence
of
highway
robbery
with
violence
it
should
be
noted
that
in
the
act
in
question
no
such
excuse
can
apply
for
it
is
appointed
to
be
inflicted
for
offences
which
whatever
else
they
may
be
do
not
in
their
nature
involve
violence
and
hence
which
can
not
be
described
as
brutal
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
term
the
nature
of
the
whole
measure
as
of
the
agitation
itself
which
preceded
it
is
conclusively
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
while
it
is
well
known
that
the
number
of
women
gaining
a
living
by
procuration
is
much
greater
than
the
number
of
men
engaged
therein
comparatively
little
vituperation
was
heard
against
the
female
delinquents
in
the
matter
and
certainly
none
of
the
vitriolic
ferocity
that
was
poured
out
upon
the
men
alleged
to
participate
in
the
traffic
a
corresponding
distinction
was
represented
in
the
measure
itself
by
the
allocation
of
the
torture
of
the
lash
to
men
alone
it
is
clear
therefore
that
the
zeal
for
the
suppression
of
the
traffic
in
question
was
not
the
sole
motive
in
the
ardour
of
the
flogging
fraternity
even
the
at
the
back
of
the
whole
of
this
class
of
legislation
seems
insufficient
to
account
for
the
outbreak
of
bestial
for
the
tigerish
ferocity
of
which
the
flogging
clauses
in
the
act
are
the
outcome
there
is
i
take
it
no
doubt
that
psychical
sexual
aberration
plays
a
not
inconsiderable
part
in
many
of
those
a
word
that
they
are
labouring
under
some
degree
of
sadism
the
lustful
glee
on
the
part
of
the
aforesaid
persons
which
greets
the
notion
of
the
partial
flaying
alive
for
that
is
what
the
cat
means
of
some
poor
wretch
who
has
succumbed
to
the
temptation
of
getting
his
livelihood
by
an
improper
method
is
hardly
to
be
explained
on
any
other
hypothesis
experts
allege
that
traces
of
aberration
are
latent
in
many
persons
where
it
would
be
least
expected
and
it
is
likely
enough
that
these
latent
tendencies
in
both
men
and
women
should
become
active
under
the
cover
of
an
agitation
in
favour
of
purity
and
to
the
point
of
gratifying
itself
with
the
thought
of
torture
inflicted
upon
men
a
element
of
another
kind
doubtless
also
plays
a
not
unimportant
rôle
in
the
agitation
of
ladies
in
favour
of
that
abomination
social
purity
which
being
interpreted
generally
means
lubricity
turned
upside
down
the
fiery
zeal
manifested
by
many
of
those
ladies
for
the
suppression
of
the
male
sex
is
assuredly
not
without
its
pathological
significance
the
monstrosity
of
the
recent
slave
enactment
and
its
savage
vindictiveness
is
shown
not
merely
as
already
observed
in
the
agitation
which
preceded
it
with
its
exaggerated
vilification
of
the
male
offenders
in
the
matter
of
procuration
and
its
passing
over
with
comparative
slight
censure
the
more
numerous
female
offenders
or
in
the
general
spirit
animating
the
act
itself
but
it
is
noticeable
in
the
very
preposterous
exaggeration
of
its
provisions
for
example
in
the
section
dealing
with
the
the
framers
of
this
act
and
the
previous
criminal
law
amendment
acts
to
which
this
latest
one
is
merely
supplementary
are
not
satisfied
with
penalising
the
man
who
has
no
other
means
of
subsistence
beyond
what
he
derives
from
the
wages
of
some
female
friend
s
prostitution
but
they
strike
with
impartial
rigour
the
man
who
knowingly
lives
or
in
from
such
a
source
if
therefore
the
clause
were
taken
in
its
strict
sense
any
poor
man
who
accepted
the
hospitality
of
a
woman
of
doubtful
virtue
in
the
matter
of
a
drink
or
a
dinner
would
put
himself
within
the
pale
of
this
clause
in
the
act
and
might
be
duly
flayed
by
the
cat
in
consequence
the
most
flagrant
case
occurred
in
a
london
police
court
in
march
in
which
a
youth
of
eighteen
years
against
whose
general
character
nothing
was
alleged
and
who
was
known
to
be
in
employment
as
a
carman
was
sentenced
to
a
month
s
hard
labour
under
the
following
circumstances
was
reported
that
he
had
been
living
with
a
woman
apparently
considerably
older
than
himself
whom
admittedly
he
had
supported
by
his
own
exertions
and
when
this
was
insufficient
even
by
the
pawning
of
his
clothes
and
whom
as
soon
as
he
discovered
she
was
earning
money
by
prostitution
he
had
left
would
it
be
believed
that
a
prosecution
was
instituted
by
the
police
against
this
young
man
under
the
iniquitous
white
slave
traffic
act
but
what
seems
still
more
incredible
is
that
the
magistrate
presumably
a
sane
gentleman
after
admitting
that
the
poor
fellow
was
more
sinned
against
than
sinning
did
not
hesitate
to
pass
on
him
a
sentence
of
one
month
s
hard
labour
of
course
the
woman
who
was
the
head
and
front
of
the
offending
if
offending
there
was
remained
untouched
the
above
is
a
mild
specimen
of
justice
as
meted
out
in
our
police
courts
for
men
only
quite
recently
there
was
a
case
in
the
north
of
england
of
a
carter
who
admittedly
worked
at
his
calling
but
who
it
was
alleged
was
assisted
by
women
with
whom
he
had
lived
now
this
unfortunate
man
was
sentenced
to
a
long
term
of
imprisonment
plus
flogging
for
the
judges
of
course
any
extension
of
their
power
over
the
prisoner
in
the
dock
is
a
godsend
it
is
quite
evident
that
they
are
revelling
in
their
new
privilege
to
inflict
torture
one
of
them
had
the
shamelessness
recently
to
boast
of
the
satisfaction
it
gave
him
and
to
sneer
at
those
of
his
colleagues
who
did
not
make
full
use
of
their
judicial
powers
in
this
direction
the
bogus
nature
of
the
reasons
urged
in
favour
of
the
most
atrocious
clauses
of
this
abominable
act
came
out
clearly
enough
in
the
speeches
of
the
official
spokesmen
of
the
government
in
its
favour
for
example
lord
haldane
in
the
house
of
lords
besought
the
assembled
peers
to
bethink
themselves
of
the
unhappy
victim
of
the
he
drew
a
picture
of
how
a
heartless
bully
might
beat
starve
and
otherwise
ill
treat
his
victim
besides
taking
away
her
earnings
he
omitted
to
explain
how
the
heartless
bully
in
a
free
country
could
coerce
his
victim
to
remain
with
him
against
her
will
he
ignored
the
existence
of
the
police
or
of
a
whole
army
of
social
purity
busybodies
and
vigilance
societies
for
whom
her
case
would
be
a
tasty
morsel
only
too
eagerly
snapped
at
if
the
victim
does
not
avail
herself
of
any
of
those
means
of
escape
so
ready
to
her
hand
the
presumption
is
that
she
prefers
the
company
of
her
alleged
brutal
tyrant
to
that
of
the
chaste
puritan
ladies
of
the
vigilance
societies
to
those
who
follow
the
present
state
of
artificially
fomented
public
opinion
in
the
matter
lord
haldane
s
suggestion
that
there
was
any
danger
of
the
precious
victim
not
being
sufficiently
slobbered
over
will
seem
to
be
not
without
a
touch
of
humour
furthermore
as
illustrating
the
utter
illogicality
of
the
line
taken
by
the
promoters
of
the
act
for
whom
lord
haldane
acted
as
the
mouthpiece
we
have
only
to
note
the
fact
that
the
measure
does
not
limit
the
penalties
awarded
to
cases
accompanied
by
circumstances
of
aggravation
such
as
lord
haldane
pictures
which
it
might
easily
have
done
but
extends
it
impartially
to
all
cases
whether
accompanied
by
cruelty
or
not
we
can
hardly
imagine
that
a
man
of
lord
haldane
s
intellectual
power
and
general
humanity
should
not
have
been
aware
of
the
hollowness
of
the
case
he
had
to
put
as
an
official
advocate
and
of
the
rottenness
of
the
conventional
arguments
he
had
to
state
in
its
support
when
confronted
with
the
unquestionably
true
contention
that
corporal
punishments
especially
such
as
are
of
a
savage
and
vindictive
kind
are
degrading
alike
to
the
inflicters
of
them
and
to
those
who
are
their
victims
he
replied
that
criminals
in
the
cases
in
question
were
already
so
degraded
that
they
could
not
be
degraded
further
one
would
imagine
he
could
hardly
have
failed
to
know
that
he
was
talking
pernicious
twaddle
it
is
obvious
that
this
argument
in
addition
to
its
being
untrue
in
fact
opens
the
floodgates
to
brutal
penal
legislation
all
round
so
far
at
least
as
the
more
serious
offences
are
concerned
one
could
equally
well
assert
of
murder
burglary
even
de
in
some
cases
and
other
offences
that
the
perpetrators
of
them
must
be
so
degraded
that
no
amount
of
brutal
punishment
could
degrade
them
further
everybody
can
regard
the
crime
to
which
he
has
a
pet
aversion
more
than
other
crimes
as
indicating
the
perpetrator
thereof
to
be
outside
the
pale
of
humanity
but
as
regards
the
particular
case
in
point
let
us
for
a
moment
clear
our
minds
of
cant
upon
the
subject
procuration
and
also
living
on
the
proceeds
of
prostitution
may
be
morally
abominable
methods
of
securing
a
livelihood
though
even
here
as
in
most
other
offences
there
may
be
circumstances
of
palliation
in
individual
cases
but
after
all
is
said
and
done
it
is
doubtful
whether
apart
from
any
fraud
or
misrepresentation
which
of
course
places
it
altogether
in
a
different
category
these
ought
to
be
regarded
as
offences
to
offer
facilities
or
to
act
as
an
agent
for
women
who
are
anxious
to
lead
a
gay
life
or
even
to
suggest
such
a
course
to
women
long
as
prostitution
itself
is
not
recognised
by
the
law
as
however
reprehensible
morally
would
scarcely
seem
to
transcend
the
limits
of
legitimate
individual
liberty
in
any
case
the
constituting
of
such
an
action
a
crime
must
surely
open
out
an
altogether
new
principle
in
jurisprudence
and
one
of
consequences
the
same
remarks
apply
even
more
forcibly
to
the
question
of
sharing
the
earnings
of
a
prostitute
prostitution
is
not
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
a
crime
or
even
a
misdemeanour
the
woman
who
makes
her
living
as
a
prostitute
is
under
the
protection
of
the
law
and
the
money
she
receives
from
her
customer
is
recognised
as
her
property
if
she
however
in
the
exercise
of
her
right
of
free
disposition
of
that
property
gives
some
of
it
to
a
male
friend
that
friend
by
the
mere
acceptance
of
a
free
gift
becomes
a
criminal
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
anything
more
preposterous
judging
by
all
hitherto
recognised
principles
of
jurisprudence
can
scarcely
be
imagined
even
from
the
moral
point
of
view
of
the
class
of
cases
coming
under
the
purview
of
the
act
of
men
who
in
part
share
in
the
proceeds
of
their
female
friends
traffic
must
involve
many
instances
in
which
no
sane
one
who
is
not
bitten
by
the
rabid
of
the
feminist
and
social
purity
regard
the
moral
obliquity
involved
as
not
very
serious
take
for
instance
the
case
of
a
man
who
is
out
of
work
who
is
perhaps
starving
and
receives
temporary
assistance
of
this
kind
would
any
reasonable
person
allege
that
such
a
man
was
in
the
lowest
depths
of
moral
degradation
still
less
that
he
merited
for
this
breach
at
most
of
fine
delicacy
of
feeling
the
flaying
alive
prescribed
by
the
act
under
consideration
besides
all
this
it
is
well
known
that
some
women
shop
assistants
and
others
gain
part
of
their
living
by
their
reputable
avocation
and
part
in
another
way
now
presumably
the
handing
over
of
a
portion
of
her
regular
salary
to
her
lover
would
not
constitute
the
latter
a
flayable
criminal
but
the
endowment
of
him
with
a
portion
of
any
of
the
presents
obtained
by
her
pursuit
of
her
other
calling
would
do
so
the
process
of
earmarking
the
permissible
and
the
impermissible
gift
strikes
one
as
very
difficult
even
if
possible
the
point
last
referred
to
leads
us
on
to
another
reflection
if
the
man
who
in
whole
or
in
part
lives
on
the
proceeds
of
a
woman
s
prostitution
is
of
necessity
a
degraded
wretch
outside
the
pale
of
all
humanity
as
he
is
represented
to
be
by
the
flogging
fraternity
how
about
the
employer
or
employeress
of
female
labour
who
bases
his
or
her
scale
of
wages
on
the
assumption
that
the
girls
and
women
he
or
she
employs
supplement
these
wages
by
presents
received
after
working
hours
for
their
sexual
other
words
by
prostitution
many
of
these
employers
of
labour
are
doubtless
to
be
found
among
the
noble
band
of
advocates
of
white
slave
traffic
bills
flogging
and
social
purity
the
above
persons
of
course
are
respectable
members
of
society
while
a
is
an
outcast
in
addition
to
the
motives
before
alluded
to
as
actuating
the
promoters
of
the
factitious
and
bogus
white
slave
agitation
there
is
one
very
powerful
political
and
economic
motive
which
must
not
be
left
out
of
sight
in
view
of
the
existing
labour
unrest
it
is
highly
desirable
from
the
point
of
view
of
our
possessing
and
governing
classes
that
popular
attention
should
be
drawn
off
labour
wrongs
and
labour
grievances
on
to
something
less
harassing
to
the
capitalist
and
official
mind
now
the
agitation
forms
a
capital
red
herring
for
drawing
the
popular
scent
off
class
opposition
by
substituting
sex
antagonism
in
its
place
if
you
can
set
public
opinion
off
on
the
question
of
wicked
man
and
woman
you
have
done
a
good
deal
to
help
capitalistic
enterprise
to
tide
over
the
present
crisis
the
insistence
of
public
opinion
on
better
conditions
for
the
labourer
will
thus
be
weakened
by
being
diverted
into
urging
forward
vindictive
laws
against
men
and
for
placing
as
far
as
may
be
the
whole
power
of
the
state
at
the
disposal
of
the
virago
the
shrew
and
the
female
sharper
in
their
designs
upon
their
male
victim
for
be
it
remembered
it
is
always
the
worst
type
of
woman
to
whom
the
advantage
of
laws
passed
as
the
result
of
the
campaign
accrues
the
real
nature
of
the
campaign
is
crucially
exhibited
in
some
of
the
concrete
demands
put
forward
by
its
advocates
one
of
the
measures
proposed
in
the
woman
s
charter
drawn
up
with
the
approval
of
all
prominent
feminists
by
lady
m
laren
now
lady
aberconway
some
four
or
five
years
back
and
which
had
been
previously
advocated
by
other
feminist
writers
was
to
the
effect
that
a
husband
in
addition
to
his
other
liabilities
should
be
legally
compelled
to
pay
a
certain
sum
to
his
wife
ostensibly
as
wages
for
her
housekeeping
services
no
matter
whether
she
performs
the
services
well
or
ill
or
not
at
all
whatever
the
woman
is
or
does
the
husband
has
to
pay
all
the
same
another
of
the
clauses
in
this
precious
document
is
to
the
effect
that
a
wife
is
to
be
under
no
obligation
to
follow
her
husband
compelled
probably
by
the
necessity
of
earning
a
livelihood
for
himself
and
her
to
any
place
of
residence
outside
the
british
islands
that
favourite
crank
of
the
feminist
of
raising
the
age
of
consent
with
the
result
of
increasing
the
number
of
victims
of
the
designing
young
female
should
speak
for
itself
to
every
unbiassed
person
one
of
the
proposals
which
finds
most
favour
with
the
sentimental
feminist
is
the
demand
that
in
the
case
of
the
murder
by
a
woman
of
her
illegitimate
child
the
putative
father
should
be
placed
in
the
dock
as
an
accessory
in
other
words
a
man
should
be
punished
for
a
crime
of
which
he
is
wholly
innocent
because
the
guilty
person
was
forsooth
a
woman
that
such
a
suggestion
should
be
so
much
as
entertained
by
otherwise
sane
persons
is
indeed
significant
of
the
degeneracy
of
mental
and
moral
fibre
induced
by
the
feminist
movement
for
it
may
be
taken
as
typical
it
reminds
me
of
a
feminist
friend
of
mine
who
challenged
by
me
sought
for
long
in
vain
to
find
a
case
in
the
courts
in
which
a
man
was
unduly
favoured
at
the
expense
of
a
woman
at
last
he
succeeded
in
lighting
upon
the
following
from
somewhere
in
scotland
a
man
and
woman
who
had
been
drinking
went
home
to
bed
and
the
woman
caused
the
death
of
her
baby
by
overlaying
both
the
man
and
the
woman
were
brought
before
the
court
on
the
charge
of
manslaughter
for
causing
the
death
by
culpable
negligence
of
the
infant
in
accordance
with
the
evidence
the
woman
who
had
overlaid
the
baby
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
six
months
imprisonment
and
naturally
the
man
who
had
not
done
so
was
released
now
in
the
judgment
of
my
feminist
friend
in
other
matters
sane
enough
the
fact
that
the
man
who
had
not
committed
any
offence
was
let
off
while
his
female
companion
who
had
was
punished
showed
the
bias
of
the
court
in
favour
of
the
man
surely
this
is
a
noteworthy
illustration
glaring
as
it
is
of
how
all
judgment
is
completely
overbalanced
and
destroyed
in
otherwise
judicial
how
such
minds
are
completely
hypnotised
by
the
adoption
of
the
feminist
dogma
as
a
matter
of
fact
of
course
the
task
my
friend
set
himself
to
do
was
hopeless
as
against
the
cases
which
daily
occur
all
over
the
country
of
flagrant
injustice
to
men
and
partiality
to
women
on
the
part
of
the
courts
there
is
i
venture
to
assert
not
to
be
found
a
single
case
within
the
limits
of
the
four
seas
of
a
judicial
decision
in
the
contrary
of
one
favouring
the
man
at
the
expense
of
the
woman
this
sex
hatred
so
often
vindictive
in
its
character
of
men
for
men
which
has
for
its
results
that
laws
invariably
favour
the
opposite
sex
and
that
justice
follows
the
same
course
is
a
psychological
problem
which
is
well
worth
the
earnest
attention
of
students
of
sociology
and
thinkers
generally
chapter
iv
always
the
injured
innocent
while
what
we
have
termed
political
feminism
vehemently
asserts
its
favourite
dogma
the
intellectual
and
moral
equality
of
the
the
woman
is
as
good
as
the
man
if
not
feminism
as
vehemently
seeks
to
exonerate
every
female
criminal
and
protests
against
any
punishment
being
meted
out
to
her
approaching
in
severity
that
which
would
be
awarded
a
man
in
a
similar
case
it
does
so
on
grounds
which
presuppose
the
old
theory
of
the
immeasurable
inferiority
mental
and
moral
of
woman
which
are
so
indignantly
spurned
by
every
political
in
his
or
her
capacity
as
such
we
might
suppose
therefore
that
political
feminism
with
its
theory
of
sex
equality
based
on
the
assumption
of
equal
sex
capacity
would
be
in
strong
opposition
in
this
matter
with
sentimental
feminism
which
seeks
as
its
name
implies
to
attenuate
female
responsibility
on
grounds
which
are
not
distinguishable
from
the
assumption
of
inferiority
but
does
political
feminism
consistently
adopt
this
logical
position
not
one
whit
it
is
quite
true
that
some
feminists
when
hard
pressed
may
grudgingly
concede
the
untenability
on
rational
grounds
of
the
sentimental
feminists
claims
but
taken
as
a
whole
and
in
their
practical
dealings
the
political
feminists
are
in
accord
with
the
sentimental
feminists
in
claiming
female
immunity
on
the
ground
of
sex
this
is
shown
in
every
case
where
a
female
criminal
receives
more
than
a
nominal
sentence
we
have
already
given
examples
of
the
fact
in
question
and
they
could
be
indefinitely
extended
at
the
end
of
the
year
at
birmingham
in
the
case
of
a
woman
convicted
of
the
murder
of
her
paramour
by
deliberately
pouring
inflammable
oil
over
him
while
he
was
asleep
and
then
setting
it
afire
and
afterwards
not
only
exulting
in
the
action
but
saying
she
was
ready
to
do
it
again
the
jury
brought
in
recommendation
to
mercy
with
their
verdict
and
needless
to
say
the
influence
of
political
and
sentimental
feminism
was
too
strong
to
allow
the
capital
sentence
to
be
carried
out
even
with
such
a
fiendish
wretch
as
this
in
the
case
of
the
italian
woman
in
canada
napolitano
before
mentioned
the
female
franchise
societies
issued
a
petition
to
mr
borden
the
premier
of
canada
in
favour
of
the
commutation
of
sentence
the
usual
course
was
adopted
in
this
case
as
in
most
others
in
which
a
woman
murders
a
wit
the
truly
chivalrous
one
of
trying
to
blacken
the
character
of
the
dead
victim
in
defence
of
the
action
of
the
murderess
in
other
cases
more
especially
of
course
where
the
man
is
guilty
of
a
crime
against
a
woman
when
mercy
is
asked
for
the
offender
we
are
pitifully
adjured
to
think
of
the
poor
as
we
have
seen
lord
haldane
trotted
out
this
exhortation
in
a
case
where
it
was
absurdly
inappropriate
since
the
victim
had
only
herself
to
thank
for
being
a
victim
and
still
more
for
remaining
a
we
never
hear
this
plea
for
the
victim
urged
where
the
victim
happens
to
be
a
man
and
the
offender
a
woman
compare
this
with
the
case
of
the
boy
of
nineteen
beal
whom
mr
m
kenna
hanged
for
the
murder
of
his
sweetheart
and
that
in
the
teeth
of
an
explanation
given
in
the
defence
which
was
at
least
possible
if
not
probable
and
which
certainly
putting
it
at
the
very
lowest
introduced
an
element
of
doubt
into
the
case
fancy
a
girl
of
nineteen
being
convicted
whatever
the
evidence
of
having
poisoned
her
paramour
or
even
if
she
were
convicted
fancy
her
being
given
more
than
a
short
term
of
imprisonment
a
man
murdered
by
a
woman
is
always
the
horrid
brute
while
the
woman
murdered
by
the
man
is
just
as
surely
the
angelic
victim
anyone
who
reads
reports
of
cases
with
an
unbiassed
mind
must
admit
the
absolute
accuracy
of
this
statement
divine
woman
is
always
the
injured
innocent
not
only
in
the
graver
crimes
such
as
murder
but
also
in
the
minor
offences
coming
under
the
cognisance
of
the
law
at
the
ledbury
petty
sessions
a
woman
in
the
employment
of
a
draper
who
had
purloined
goods
to
the
amount
of
was
acquitted
on
the
ground
of
kleptomania
and
this
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
she
had
been
in
the
employment
of
the
prosecutor
for
over
five
years
had
never
complained
of
illness
and
had
never
been
absent
from
business
also
that
her
landlady
gave
evidence
showing
that
she
was
sound
in
mind
and
body
at
the
very
same
sessions
two
men
were
sentenced
respectively
to
eight
and
twelve
months
imprisonment
for
stealing
goods
to
the
value
of
november
at
this
point
i
may
be
permitted
to
quote
from
the
article
formerly
alluded
to
november
case
taken
from
a
report
in
news
of
the
of
february
a
young
woman
shot
at
the
local
postman
with
a
revolver
the
bullet
grazed
his
face
she
having
fired
point
blank
at
his
head
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
although
the
revolver
was
found
on
her
when
arrested
and
the
facts
were
admitted
and
were
as
follows
noon
she
left
her
house
crossing
three
fields
to
the
house
of
the
victim
who
was
at
home
and
alone
upon
his
appearing
she
fired
point
blank
at
his
head
he
banged
to
the
door
and
thus
turned
off
the
bullet
which
grazed
his
face
and
ploughed
a
furrow
through
his
she
had
by
her
when
arrested
a
revolver
cocked
and
with
four
chambers
let
us
now
take
the
crime
of
violent
assault
with
attempt
to
do
bodily
injury
the
following
cases
will
serve
as
illustrative
examples
news
of
the
may
a
nurse
in
belfast
sued
her
lost
swain
for
breach
of
promise
obtained
damages
although
it
was
admitted
by
her
counsel
that
she
had
thrown
vitriol
over
the
defendant
thereby
injuring
him
and
the
defendant
had
not
prosecuted
her
also
it
was
admitted
that
she
had
been
carrying
on
with
another
man
from
morning
of
july
i
have
taken
the
following
extraordinary
facts
as
to
the
varied
punishment
awarded
in
cases
of
that
of
a
woman
who
threw
vitriol
over
a
sergeant
at
aldershot
and
was
sentenced
to
six
months
imprisonment
without
hard
labour
while
a
man
who
threw
it
over
a
woman
at
portsmouth
was
tried
and
convicted
at
the
hants
assizes
on
july
and
sentenced
by
mr
justice
bigham
to
twelve
years
penal
servitude
as
regards
the
first
case
it
will
be
observed
that
notwithstanding
a
crime
which
in
the
case
of
a
man
was
described
by
the
judge
as
cowardly
and
vile
and
meriting
twelve
years
penal
servitude
the
woman
was
rewarded
by
damages
for
to
be
obtained
from
the
very
victim
whom
she
had
done
her
best
to
maim
for
life
besides
being
unfaithful
to
him
and
who
had
generously
abstained
from
prosecuting
but
it
is
not
merely
in
cases
of
murder
attempted
murder
or
serious
assault
that
justice
is
mocked
by
the
present
state
of
our
law
and
its
administration
in
the
interests
of
the
female
sex
the
same
attitude
is
observed
the
same
farcical
sentences
on
women
whether
the
crime
be
theft
fraud
common
assault
criminal
slander
or
other
minor
offences
we
have
the
same
preposterous
excuses
admitted
the
same
preposterous
pleas
allowed
and
the
same
farcical
sentences
indeed
any
sentence
be
passed
at
all
the
following
examples
i
have
culled
at
random
february
at
the
london
sessions
mr
robert
wallace

to
deal
with
the
case
of
a

living
at
hampstead

pleaded
guilty
to
obtaining
goods
to
the
amount
of
by
false
pretences
in
explanation
of
her
crime
it
was
stated
that
she
was
under
a
mistaken
impression
that
her
engagement
would
not
lead
to
marriage
that
she
became
depressed
and
that
she
did
not
know
what
she
said
or
did
while
in
mitigation
of
punishment
it
was
urged
that
the
money
had
been
repaid
that
her
fiancé
could
not
marry
her
if
she
were
sent
to
gaol
and
that
her
life
would
be
irretrievably
ruined

she
was
discharged

when

upon

two

she
thought
to
prevent

her
counsel
pleaded
for
leniency
on
the
ground
of

previous
good
character
because
she
was
the
recorder
merely
bound
her
over

that

so
was
the

guilty
to
embezzling
and
for
the
defence
it
was
urged
that
the
prisoner
had
been
poorly
paid
and
the
recorder
hearing
that
a
gentleman
was
prepared
to
employ

as

sentenced

o

the
injured
innocent
theory
usually
comes
into
play
with
magistrates
when
a
woman
is
charged
with
aggravated
annoyance
and
harassing
of
men
in
their
business
or
profession
when
as
already
stated
the
administrator
of
the
law
will
usually
tell
the
prosecutor
that
he
can
not
interfere
in
the
opposite
case
of
a
man
annoying
a
woman
under
like
circumstances
he
invariably
has
to
find
substantial
sureties
for
his
good
behaviour
or
go
to
gaol
no
injured
innocence
for
him
there
is
another
case
in
which
it
seems
probable
that
animated
by
the
same
fixed
idea
those
responsible
for
the
framing
of
laws
have
flagrantly
neglected
an
obvious
measure
for
public
safety
we
refer
to
the
unrestricted
sale
of
sulphuric
acid
vitriol
which
is
permitted
now
here
we
have
a
substance
subserving
only
very
special
purposes
in
industry
none
in
household
economy
or
in
other
departments
save
for
criminal
ends
which
is
nevertheless
procurable
without
let
or
hindrance
is
it
possible
to
believe
that
this
would
be
the
case
if
men
were
in
the
habit
of
using
this
substance
in
settling
their
differences
with
each
other
even
still
more
if
they
employed
it
by
way
of
emphasising
their
disapproval
of
the
jilting
of
sweethearts
that
it
should
be
employed
by
women
in
wreaking
their
vengeance
on
recalcitrant
lovers
seems
a
natural
if
not
precisely
a
commendable
action
in
the
eyes
of
a
sentimental
feminist
public
opinion
and
one
which
on
the
mildest
hypothesis
doesn
t
hence
a
deadly
substance
may
be
freely
bought
and
sold
as
though
it
were
oil
a
very
nice
thing
for
dastardly
viragoes
for
whom
public
opinion
has
only
the
mildest
of
censures
in
any
reasonable
society
the
indiscriminate
sale
of
corrosive
substances
would
in
itself
be
a
crime
punishable
with
a
heavy
term
of
imprisonment
it
is
not
only
by
men
and
by
a
morbid
public
opinion
inflamed
by
feminist
sentiment
in
general
that
female
criminals
are
surrounded
by
a
halo
of
injured
innocence
the
reader
can
hardly
fail
to
notice
that
such
women
have
the
effrontery
to
pretend
to
regard
themselves
in
this
light
this
is
often
so
in
cases
of
assault
murder
or
attempted
murder
of
lovers
by
their
sweethearts
such
is
of
course
particularly
noticeable
in
the
senselessly
wicked
outrages
of
which
more
anon
the
late
otto
weininger
in
his
book
before
quoted
geschlecht
und
charakter
sex
and
character
has
some
noteworthy
remarks
on
this
remarks
which
whether
we
accept
his
suggested
theory
or
not
might
well
have
been
written
as
a
comment
on
recent
cases
of
suffragette
crimes
and
criminals
the
male
criminal
says
weininger
has
from
his
birth
the
same
relation
to
the
idea
of
value
moral
value
as
any
other
man
in
whom
the
criminal
tendencies
governing
himself
may
be
wholly
absent
the
female
on
the
other
hand
often
claims
to
be
fully
justified
when
she
has
committed
the
greatest
conceivable
infamy
while
the
genuine
criminal
is
obtusely
silent
against
all
reproaches
a
woman
will
express
her
astonishment
and
indignation
that
anyone
can
doubt
her
perfect
right
to
act
as
she
has
done
women
are
convinced
of
their
being
in
the
right
without
ever
having
sat
in
judgment
on
themselves
the
male
criminal
it
may
be
true
does
not
do
so
either
but
then
he
never
maintains
that
he
is
in
the
right
he
rather
goes
hastily
out
of
the
way
of
discussing
right
and
wrong
because
it
reminds
him
of
his
guilt
in
this
fact
we
have
a
proof
that
he
has
a
relationship
to
the
moral
idea
and
that
it
is
unfaithfulness
to
his
better
self
of
which
he
is
unwilling
to
be
reminded
no
male
criminal
has
ever
really
believed
that
injustice
has
been
done
him
by
punishment
the
female
criminal
on
the
other
hand
is
convinced
of
the
maliciousness
of
her
accusers
and
if
she
is
unwilling
no
man
can
persuade
her
that
she
has
done
wrong
should
someone
admonish
her
it
is
true
that
she
often
bursts
into
tears
begs
for
forgiveness
and
admits
her
fault
she
may
even
believe
indeed
that
she
really
feels
this
fault
such
is
only
the
case
however
when
she
has
felt
inclined
to
do
so
for
this
very
dissolving
in
tears
affects
her
always
with
a
certain
voluptuous
pleasure
the
male
criminal
is
obstinate
he
does
not
allow
himself
to
be
turned
round
in
a
moment
as
the
apparent
defiance
of
a
woman
may
be
converted
into
an
apparent
sense
of
guilt
where
that
is
the
accuser
understands
how
to
handle
her
geschlecht
und
charakter
pp
weininger
s
conclusion
is
not
that
woman
is
naturally
evil
or
but
rather
that
she
is
merely
in
other
words
that
she
is
destitute
of
what
is
commonly
called
moral
the
cases
of
female
penitents
and
others
which
seem
to
contradict
this
announcement
weininger
explains
by
the
hypothesis
that
it
is
only
in
company
and
under
external
influence
that
woman
can
feel
be
all
this
as
it
may
the
fact
remains
that
women
when
most
patently
and
obviously
guilty
of
vile
and
criminal
actions
will
with
the
most
complete
nonchalance
insist
that
they
are
in
the
right
this
may
be
and
very
possibly
often
is
mere
impudent
effrontery
relying
on
the
privilege
of
the
female
sex
or
it
may
in
part
at
least
as
weininger
insists
be
traceable
to
special
but
in
any
case
the
singular
fact
is
that
men
and
men
even
of
otherwise
judicial
capacity
are
to
be
found
who
are
prepared
virtually
to
accept
the
justice
of
this
attitude
and
who
are
ready
to
condone
if
not
directly
to
defend
any
conduct
no
matter
how
vile
or
how
criminal
on
the
part
of
a
woman
we
have
illustrations
of
this
class
of
judgment
almost
every
day
but
i
propose
to
give
two
instances
of
what
i
should
deem
typical
if
slightly
extreme
perversions
of
moral
judgment
on
the
part
of
two
men
both
of
them
of
social
and
intellectual
standing
and
without
any
doubt
personally
of
the
highest
integrity
dr
james
donaldson
principal
of
the
university
of
st
andrews
in
his
work
entitled
woman
her
position
and
influence
in
ancient
greece
and
rome
and
among
the
early
christians
commenting
on
the
story
attributed
to
the
year
which
may
or
may
not
be
historical
of
the
wholesale
poisoning
of
their
husbands
by
roman
matrons
as
well
as
of
subsequent
cases
of
the
same
crime
concludes
his
remarks
with
these
words
it
seems
to
me
that
we
must
regard
them
namely
these
stories
or
facts
as
we
may
choose
to
consider
them
as
indicating
that
the
roman
matrons
felt
sometimes
that
they
were
badly
treated
that
they
ought
not
to
endure
the
bad
treatment
and
that
they
ought
to
take
the
only
means
that
they
possessed
of
expressing
their
feelings
and
of
wreaking
vengeance
by
employing
poison
now
though
it
may
be
said
that
in
this
passage
we
have
no
direct
justification
of
the
atrocious
crime
attributed
to
the
roman
matrons
yet
it
can
hardly
be
denied
that
we
have
here
a
distinct
condonation
of
the
infamous
and
dastardly
act
such
a
condonation
as
the
worthy
principal
of
st
andrews
university
would
hardly
have
meted
out
to
men
under
any
circumstances
probably
professor
donaldson
in
writing
the
above
felt
that
his
comments
would
not
be
resented
very
strongly
even
if
not
actually
approved
by
public
opinion
steeped
as
it
is
at
the
present
time
in
feminism
political
and
sentimental
another
instance
this
time
of
direct
special
pleading
to
prove
a
woman
guilty
of
an
atrocious
crime
to
be
an
injured
it
is
taken
from
an
eminent
swiss
alienist
in
his
work
on
sex
dr
forel
maintains
a
thesis
which
may
or
may
not
be
true
to
the
effect
that
the
natural
maternal
instinct
is
either
absent
or
materially
weakened
in
the
case
of
a
woman
who
has
given
birth
to
a
child
begotten
by
rape
or
under
circumstances
bordering
upon
rape
and
indeed
more
or
less
in
all
cases
where
the
woman
is
an
unwilling
participant
in
the
sexual
act
by
way
of
illustration
of
this
theory
he
cites
the
case
of
a
barmaid
in
st
gallen
who
was
seduced
by
her
employer
under
such
circumstances
as
those
above
mentioned
a
child
resulted
who
was
put
out
to
nurse
at
an
institution
until
five
years
of
age
when
it
was
handed
over
to
the
care
of
the
mother
now
what
does
the
woman
do
within
a
few
hours
of
receiving
the
little
boy
into
her
keeping
she
took
him
to
a
lonely
place
and
deliberately
strangled
him
in
consequence
of
which
she
was
tried
and
condemned
now
dr
forel
in
his
feminist
zeal
feels
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
try
to
whitewash
this
female
monster
by
urging
on
the
basis
of
this
theory
the
excuse
that
under
the
circumstances
of
its
conception
one
could
not
expect
the
mother
to
have
the
ordinary
instincts
of
maternity
as
regards
her
child
the
worthy
doctor
is
apparently
so
blinded
by
his
feminist
prejudices
that
quite
apart
from
the
correctness
or
otherwise
of
his
theory
he
is
oblivious
of
the
absurd
irrelevancy
of
his
argument
what
we
may
justly
ask
has
the
maternal
instinct
or
its
absence
to
do
with
the
guilt
of
the
murderess
of
a
helpless
child
committed
to
her
care
who
or
what
the
child
was
is
immaterial
that
a
humane
and
otherwise
man
like
dr
forel
could
take
a
wretch
of
this
description
under
his
and
still
more
that
in
doing
so
he
should
serve
up
such
utterly
illogical
balderdash
by
way
of
argument
is
only
one
more
instance
of
how
the
most
men
are
rendered
fatuous
by
the
glamour
of
sentimental
feminism
in
the
present
chapter
we
have
given
a
few
typical
instances
of
the
practice
which
constitutes
one
of
the
most
conspicuous
features
of
modern
feminism
and
of
the
public
opinion
which
it
has
engendered
we
hear
and
read
of
excuses
and
condonation
for
every
crime
committed
by
a
woman
while
a
crime
of
precisely
similar
a
character
and
under
precisely
similar
circumstances
where
a
man
is
the
perpetrator
meets
with
nothing
but
virulent
execration
from
that
truculent
ass
british
public
opinion
as
manipulated
by
the
feminist
fraternity
male
and
female
this
state
of
public
opinion
reacts
of
course
upon
the
tribunals
and
has
the
result
that
women
are
practically
free
to
commit
any
offence
they
please
with
always
a
splendid
sporting
chance
of
getting
acquitted
altogether
and
a
practical
certainty
that
even
if
convicted
they
will
receive
farcical
sentences
or
should
the
sentence
be
in
any
degree
adequate
to
the
offence
that
such
sentence
will
not
be
carried
out
the
way
in
which
criminal
law
is
made
a
jest
and
a
mockery
as
regards
female
prisoners
the
treatment
of
criminal
suffragettes
is
there
in
evidence
the
excuse
of
health
being
endangered
by
their
going
without
their
breakfasts
has
resulted
in
the
release
after
a
few
days
of
women
guilty
of
the
vilest
the
attempt
to
set
fire
to
the
theatre
at
dublin
it
may
be
well
to
recall
the
outrageous
facts
of
modern
female
immunity
and
free
defiance
of
the
law
as
illustrated
by
one
quotation
of
a
description
of
the
merry
time
of
the
of
march
in
holloway
prison
given
by
a
correspondent
of
daily
the
correspondent
of
that
journal
describes
his
visit
to
the
aforesaid
prison
where
he
said
there
appeared
to
have
been
no
punishment
of
any
kind
for
any
sort
of
misbehaviour
all
over
the
place
he
writes
is
calling
to
women
everywhere
and
the
officials
seem
powerless
to
preserve
even
the
semblance
of
discipline
a
suffragist
will
call
out
her
name
while
in
a
cell
and
another
one
who
knows
her
will
answer
giving
her
name
in
return
and
a
conversation
will
then
be
carried
on
between
the
two
this
chattering
obtains
all
day
and
far
into
the
night
the
officials
as
the
wardresses
prefer
themselves
called
have
already
given
the
prison
the
name
of
the
certain
it
is
that
the
prisoners
are
treated
with
all
deference
the
reason
being
perhaps
that
the
number
of
officials
is
insufficient
to
establish
proper
order
while
i
was
waiting
yesterday
one
lady
drove
up
in
a
carriage
and
pair
in
which
were
two
policemen
and
several
bundles
of
clothes
to
enter
upon
her
sentence
and
this
is
the
note
which
seems
to
dominate
the
whole
of
the
prison
of
the
prisoners
are
supposed
to
be
serving
sentences
with
hard
labour
but
none
of
them
are
wearing
prison
clothes
and
in
only
one
or
two
instances
have
any
tasks
of
any
description
been
given
those
generally
being
a
little
sewing
or
again
a
member
of
the
women
s
freedom
league
at
a
meeting
on
may
boasted
that
the
suffragettes
had
a
wing
of
their
own
at
holloway
they
had
nice
hot
water
pipes
and
all
the
latest
improvements
and
were
able
to
climb
up
to
the
window
and
exchange
sentiments
with
their
she
had
saved
money
and
enjoyed
herself
very
much
here
we
have
a
picture
of
the
way
the
modern
authorities
of
the
law
recognise
the
injured
innocence
of
female
delinquents
who
claim
the
right
wantonly
to
destroy
property
our
present
society
based
as
it
is
on
private
and
which
usually
punished
with
the
utmost
severity
any
breach
of
the
sanctity
of
private
property
waives
its
claims
where
women
are
concerned
similarly
arson
under
circumstances
directly
endangering
human
life
for
which
the
law
prescribes
the
maximum
sentence
of
penal
servitude
for
life
is
considered
adequately
punished
by
a
week
or
two
s
imprisonment
when
those
convicted
of
the
crime
are
of
the
female
sex
oh
but
they
were
acting
from
political
motives
good
and
have
not
terrorist
anarchists
fenians
and
irish
dynamiters
of
the
land
league
days
also
acted
from
political
motives
the
terrorist
anarchist
foolish
and
indefensible
though
his
tactics
may
be
believes
honestly
enough
that
he
is
paving
the
way
for
the
abolition
of
poverty
misery
and
social
injustice
a
far
more
vital
thing
than
the
franchise
the
irish
fenians
and
dynamiters
pursued
a
similar
policy
and
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
their
honest
belief
that
it
would
further
the
cause
of
the
freedom
and
national
independence
of
ireland
yet
were
these
political
offenders
dealt
with
otherwise
than
as
ordinary
criminals
when
convicted
of
acts
qualified
by
the
law
as
felonies
and
their
acts
moreover
whatever
we
may
think
of
them
otherwise
were
in
most
cases
at
least
politically
logical
from
their
own
point
of
view
and
not
senseless
injuries
to
unoffending
persons
as
those
of
the
female
seekers
after
the
suffrage
chapter
v
the
chivalry
fake
the
justification
for
the
whole
movement
of
modern
feminism
in
one
of
its
main
practical
the
placing
of
the
female
sex
in
the
position
of
privilege
advantage
and
concentrated
in
the
current
conception
of
it
behoves
us
therefore
to
devote
some
consideration
to
the
meaning
and
implication
of
this
notion
now
this
word
chivalry
is
the
of
those
at
a
loss
for
a
justification
of
the
modern
privileging
of
women
but
those
who
use
it
seldom
give
themselves
the
trouble
to
analyse
the
connotation
of
this
term
brought
to
book
as
to
its
meaning
most
persons
would
probably
define
it
as
deference
to
or
consideration
for
weakness
especially
bodily
weakness
used
in
this
sense
however
the
term
covers
a
very
much
wider
ground
than
the
to
the
female
section
of
the
human
race
usually
associated
with
it
boys
men
whose
muscular
strength
is
below
the
average
domestic
animals
might
all
claim
this
special
protection
as
a
plea
of
chivalry
in
their
favour
and
yet
we
do
not
find
different
criminal
laws
or
different
rules
of
prison
treatment
say
for
men
whose
stamina
is
below
the
average
neither
do
we
find
such
men
or
boys
exempted
by
law
from
corporal
punishment
in
consequence
of
their
weakness
unless
as
an
exception
in
individual
cases
when
the
weakness
amounts
to
dangerous
physical
disability
neither
again
in
the
general
affairs
of
life
are
we
accustomed
to
see
any
such
deference
to
men
of
weaker
muscular
or
constitutional
development
as
custom
exacts
in
the
case
of
women
once
more
looking
at
the
question
from
the
other
side
do
we
find
the
claim
of
chivalry
dropped
in
the
case
of
the
powerful
virago
or
the
muscularly
developed
female
athlete
the
sportswoman
who
rides
hunts
plays
cricket
football
golf
and
other
masculine
games
and
who
may
even
fence
or
box
not
one
whit
it
would
seem
then
that
the
definition
of
the
term
under
consideration
based
on
the
notion
of
deference
to
mere
weakness
as
such
will
hardly
hold
water
since
in
its
application
the
question
of
sex
always
takes
precedence
of
that
of
weakness
let
us
try
again
abandoning
for
the
moment
the
definition
of
chivalry
as
a
consideration
for
weakness
considered
as
we
may
term
it
let
us
see
whether
the
definition
of
consideration
for
defencelessness
in
a
given
coincide
with
the
current
usage
of
the
word
but
here
again
we
are
met
with
the
fact
that
the
man
in
the
hands
of
the
wit
in
the
grip
of
the
forces
of
the
state
ay
even
the
strongest
man
were
he
a
very
hercules
is
in
as
precisely
as
defenceless
and
helpless
a
position
relative
to
those
in
whose
power
he
finds
himself
as
the
weakest
woman
would
be
in
the
like
case
neither
more
nor
less
and
yet
an
enlightened
and
chivalrous
public
opinion
tolerates
the
most
fiendish
barbarities
and
excogitated
cruelties
being
perpetrated
upon
male
convicts
in
our
gaols
while
it
shudders
with
horror
at
the
notion
of
female
convicts
being
accorded
any
severity
of
punishment
at
all
even
for
the
same
or
for
that
matter
more
heinous
offences
a
particularly
crass
and
crucial
illustration
is
that
infamous
piece
of
sex
legislation
which
has
already
occupied
our
attention
in
the
course
of
the
present
wit
the
white
slave
traffic
act
it
is
plain
then
that
chivalry
as
understood
in
the
present
day
really
spells
sex
privilege
and
sex
favouritism
pure
and
simple
and
that
any
attempts
to
define
the
term
on
a
larger
basis
or
to
give
it
a
colourable
rationality
founded
on
fact
are
simply
subterfuges
conscious
or
unconscious
on
the
part
of
those
who
put
them
forward
the
etymology
of
the
word
chivalry
is
well
known
and
obvious
enough
the
term
meant
originally
the
virtues
associated
with
knighthood
considered
as
a
whole
bravery
even
to
the
extent
of
reckless
daring
loyalty
to
the
chief
or
feudal
superior
generosity
to
a
fallen
foe
general
and
including
of
course
the
succour
of
the
weak
and
the
oppressed
generally
the
female
sex
when
in
difficulties
it
would
be
idle
of
course
to
insist
upon
the
historical
definition
of
the
term
language
develops
and
words
in
course
of
time
depart
widely
from
their
original
connotation
so
that
etymology
alone
is
seldom
of
much
value
in
practically
determining
the
definition
of
words
in
their
application
at
the
present
day
but
the
fact
is
none
the
less
worthy
of
note
that
only
a
fragment
of
the
original
connotation
of
the
word
chivalry
is
covered
by
the
term
as
used
in
our
time
and
that
even
that
fragment
is
torn
from
its
original
connection
and
is
made
to
serve
as
a
scarecrow
in
the
field
of
public
opinion
to
intimidate
all
who
refuse
to
act
upon
or
who
protest
against
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
the
female
sex
one
among
many
apposite
cases
which
has
occurred
recently
was
protested
against
in
a
letter
to
daily
march
in
which
it
was
pointed
out
that
while
a
suffragette
got
a
few
months
imprisonment
in
the
second
division
for
wilfully
setting
fire
to
the
pavilion
in
kew
gardens
a
few
days
previously
at
the
lewes
assizes
a
man
had
been
sentenced
to
five
years
penal
servitude
for
burning
a
rick
i
have
said
that
even
that
subsidiary
element
in
the
old
original
notion
of
chivalry
which
is
now
the
only
surviving
remnant
of
its
original
connotation
is
torn
from
its
connection
and
hence
has
necessarily
become
radically
changed
in
its
meaning
from
being
part
of
a
general
code
of
manners
enjoined
upon
a
particular
guild
or
profession
it
has
been
degraded
to
mean
the
exclusive
right
in
one
sex
guaranteed
by
law
and
custom
to
certain
advantages
and
exemptions
without
any
corresponding
responsibility
let
us
make
no
mistake
about
this
when
the
limelight
of
a
little
plain
but
critical
is
turned
upon
this
notion
of
chivalry
hitherto
regarded
as
so
sacrosanct
it
is
seen
to
be
but
a
poor
thing
after
all
and
when
men
have
acquired
the
habit
of
habitually
turning
the
light
of
such
criticism
upon
it
the
accusation
so
terrible
in
the
present
state
of
public
opinion
of
being
unchivalrous
will
lose
its
terrors
for
them
in
the
ages
of
chivalry
themselves
it
never
meant
as
it
does
the
woman
right
or
wrong
it
never
meant
as
it
does
the
general
legal
and
social
privilege
of
sex
it
never
meant
a
social
defence
or
a
legal
exoneration
for
the
bad
and
even
the
criminal
woman
simply
because
she
is
a
woman
it
meant
none
of
these
things
all
it
meant
was
a
voluntary
or
gratuitous
personal
service
to
the
forlorn
women
which
the
members
of
the
knights
guild
among
other
such
services
many
of
them
taking
precedence
of
this
one
were
supposed
to
perform
so
far
as
courage
is
concerned
which
was
perhaps
the
first
of
the
chivalric
virtues
in
the
old
days
it
certainly
requires
more
courage
in
our
days
to
deal
severely
with
a
woman
when
she
deserves
it
as
a
man
would
be
dealt
with
in
like
circumstances
than
it
does
to
back
up
a
woman
against
her
wicked
male
opponent
it
is
a
cheap
thing
for
example
in
the
case
of
a
man
and
woman
quarrelling
in
the
street
to
play
out
the
stage
rôle
of
the
bold
and
gallant
englishman
who
won
t
see
a
woman
maltreated
and
put
upon
not
he
and
this
of
course
without
any
inquiry
into
the
merits
of
the
quarrel
to
swim
with
the
stream
to
make
a
pretence
of
boldness
and
bravery
when
all
the
time
you
know
you
have
the
backing
of
conventional
public
opinion
and
behind
you
is
the
cheapest
of
mock
heroics
chivalry
means
the
woman
right
or
wrong
just
as
patriotism
means
my
country
right
or
in
other
words
chivalry
is
only
another
name
for
sentimental
feminism
every
outrageous
pretension
of
sentimental
feminism
can
be
justified
by
the
appeal
to
chivalry
which
amounts
to
use
the
german
expression
to
an
appeal
from
pontius
to
this
sentimental
feminism
commonly
called
chivalry
is
sometimes
impudently
dubbed
by
its
votaries
it
will
presumably
continue
in
its
practical
effects
until
a
sufficient
minority
of
sensible
men
will
have
the
moral
courage
to
beard
a
feminist
public
opinion
and
shed
a
little
of
this
sort
of
the
plucky
welshmen
at
llandystwmdwy
in
their
dealings
with
the
suffragette
rowdies
on
a
memorable
occasion
showed
themselves
capable
of
doing
this
in
fact
one
good
effect
generally
of
militant
suffragetteism
seems
to
be
the
weakening
of
the
notion
of
in
its
modern
sense
of
sentimental
the
populace
of
this
country
the
combination
of
sentimental
feminism
with
its
invocation
of
the
sentiment
of
chivalry
which
was
based
essentially
on
the
assumption
of
the
mental
moral
and
physical
inferiority
of
woman
to
man
for
its
justification
with
the
pretensions
of
modern
political
feminism
is
simply
grotesque
in
its
inconsistent
absurdity
in
this
way
modern
feminism
would
fain
achieve
the
feat
of
eating
its
cake
and
having
it
too
when
political
and
economic
rights
are
in
question
such
as
involve
gain
and
social
standing
the
assumption
of
inferiority
magically
disappears
before
the
strident
assertion
of
the
dogma
of
the
equality
of
woman
with
mental
and
moral
equality
certainly
when
however
the
question
is
of
a
different
example
for
the
relieving
of
some
vile
female
criminal
of
the
penalty
of
her
sentimental
feminism
comes
into
play
then
the
whole
is
based
on
the
chivalric
sentiment
of
deference
and
consideration
for
poor
weak
woman
i
may
point
out
that
here
if
it
be
in
the
least
degree
logical
the
plea
for
mercy
or
immunity
can
hardly
be
based
on
any
other
consideration
than
that
of
an
intrinsic
moral
weakness
in
view
of
which
the
offence
is
to
be
condoned
the
plea
of
physical
weakness
if
such
be
entertained
is
here
in
most
cases
purely
irrelevant
thus
as
regards
the
commutation
of
the
death
sentence
the
question
of
the
muscular
strength
or
weakness
of
the
condemned
person
does
not
come
in
at
all
the
same
applies
to
many
other
forms
of
criminal
punishment
but
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
there
are
two
aspects
of
physical
strength
or
weakness
there
is
as
we
have
already
pointed
out
the
muscular
aspect
and
the
constitutional
aspect
if
we
concede
the
female
sex
as
essentially
and
inherently
weaker
in
muscular
power
and
development
than
the
male
this
by
no
means
involves
the
assumption
that
woman
is
constitutionally
weaker
than
man
on
the
contrary
it
is
a
known
fact
attested
as
far
as
i
am
aware
by
all
physiologists
no
less
than
by
common
observation
that
the
constitutional
toughness
and
power
of
endurance
of
woman
in
general
far
exceeds
that
of
man
as
explained
in
an
earlier
chapter
this
resilient
power
of
the
system
its
capacity
for
enduring
strain
it
may
here
be
remarked
in
passing
is
by
no
means
necessarily
a
characteristic
of
a
specially
high
stage
of
organic
evolution
we
find
it
indeed
in
many
orders
of
invertebrate
animals
in
striking
forms
be
this
as
it
may
however
the
existence
of
this
greater
constitutional
strength
or
resistant
power
in
the
female
than
in
the
male
organic
crucially
instanced
by
the
markedly
greater
of
boys
than
of
girls
in
infancy
and
early
in
respect
of
severity
of
punishment
prison
treatment
be
a
strong
against
the
plea
for
leniency
or
immunity
in
the
case
of
female
criminals
made
by
the
advocates
of
sentimental
feminism
but
these
considerations
afford
only
one
more
illustration
of
the
utter
irrationality
of
the
whole
movement
of
sentimental
feminism
identified
with
the
notion
of
for
the
rest
we
may
find
illustrations
of
this
galore
a
very
flagrant
case
is
that
infamous
rule
of
the
sea
which
came
so
much
into
prominence
at
the
time
of
the
disaster
according
to
this
preposterous
chivalric
feminism
in
the
case
of
a
ship
foundering
it
is
the
unwritten
law
of
the
seas
not
that
the
passengers
shall
leave
the
ship
and
be
rescued
in
their
order
as
they
come
but
that
the
whole
female
portion
shall
have
the
right
of
being
rescued
before
any
man
is
allowed
to
leave
the
ship
now
this
abominable
piece
of
sex
favouritism
on
the
face
of
it
cries
aloud
in
its
irrational
injustice
here
is
no
question
of
bodily
strength
or
weakness
either
muscular
or
constitutional
in
this
respect
for
the
nonce
all
are
on
a
level
but
it
is
a
case
of
life
itself
a
number
of
poor
wretches
are
doomed
to
a
watery
grave
simply
and
solely
because
they
have
not
had
the
luck
to
be
born
of
the
privileged
female
sex
such
is
chivalry
as
understood
deprivation
the
robbery
from
men
of
the
most
elementary
personal
rights
in
order
to
endow
women
with
privileges
at
the
expense
of
men
during
the
ages
of
chivalry
and
for
long
after
it
was
not
so
law
and
custom
then
was
the
same
for
men
as
for
women
in
its
incidence
to
quote
the
familiar
proverb
in
a
slightly
altered
form
what
was
sauce
for
the
gander
was
sauce
for
the
not
until
the
nineteenth
century
did
this
state
of
things
change
then
for
the
first
time
the
law
began
to
respect
persons
and
to
distinguish
in
favour
of
sex
even
taking
the
matter
on
the
conventional
ground
of
weakness
and
granting
for
the
sake
of
argument
the
relative
muscular
weakness
of
the
female
as
ground
for
her
being
allowed
the
immunity
claimed
by
modern
feminists
of
the
sentimental
school
the
distinction
is
altogether
lost
sight
of
between
weakness
as
such
and
weakness
now
i
submit
there
is
a
very
considerable
difference
between
what
is
due
to
weakness
that
is
harmless
and
unprovocative
and
weakness
that
is
still
more
when
this
aggressive
weakness
presumes
on
itself
as
weakness
and
on
the
consideration
extended
to
it
in
order
to
become
tyrannical
and
oppressive
weakness
as
such
assuredly
deserves
all
consideration
but
aggressive
weakness
deserves
none
save
to
be
crushed
beneath
the
iron
heel
of
strength
woman
at
the
present
day
has
been
encouraged
by
a
feminist
public
opinion
to
become
meanly
aggressive
under
the
protection
of
her
weakness
she
has
been
encouraged
to
forge
her
gift
of
weakness
into
a
weapon
of
tyranny
against
man
unwitting
that
in
so
doing
she
has
deprived
her
weakness
of
all
just
claim
to
consideration
or
even
to
toleration
chapter
vi
some
feminist
lies
and
fallacies
by
feminist
lies
i
understand
false
statements
put
forward
by
persons
many
of
whom
should
be
perfectly
well
aware
that
they
are
false
apparently
with
the
deliberate
intention
of
misleading
public
opinion
as
to
the
real
position
of
woman
before
the
law
by
fallacies
i
understand
statements
doubtless
dictated
by
feminist
prepossessions
or
feminist
bias
but
not
necessarily
suggesting
conscious
or
deliberate
of
the
first
order
the
statements
are
made
apparently
with
intentional
dishonesty
in
so
far
as
many
of
the
persons
making
them
are
concerned
since
we
may
reasonably
suppose
them
to
have
intelligence
and
knowledge
enough
to
be
aware
that
they
are
contrary
to
fact
the
talk
about
the
wife
being
a
chattel
for
example
is
so
palpably
absurd
in
the
face
of
the
existing
law
that
it
is
nowadays
scarcely
worth
making
although
we
do
hear
it
occasionally
even
now
but
it
was
not
even
true
under
the
old
common
law
of
england
which
for
certain
disabilities
on
the
one
hand
conceded
to
the
wife
certain
corresponding
privileges
on
the
other
the
law
of
husband
and
wife
as
modified
by
statute
in
the
course
of
the
nineteenth
century
as
i
have
often
enough
had
occasion
to
point
out
is
a
monument
of
legalised
tyranny
over
the
husband
in
the
interests
of
the
wife
if
in
the
face
of
the
facts
the
word
chattel
as
applied
to
the
wife
has
become
a
little
too
preposterous
even
for
feminist
controversial
methods
there
is
another
falsehood
scarcely
less
brazen
that
we
hear
from
feminist
fanatics
every
day
the
wife
we
are
told
is
the
only
a
more
blatant
lie
could
scarcely
be
imagined
as
every
educated
person
possessing
the
slightest
acquaintance
with
the
laws
of
england
knows
the
law
requires
the
husband
to
maintain
his
wife
in
a
manner
according
with
his
own
social
position
has
in
other
words
to
feed
clothe
and
afford
her
all
reasonable
luxuries
which
the
law
with
a
view
to
the
economic
standing
of
the
husband
regards
as
necessaries
this
although
the
husband
has
no
claim
on
the
wife
s
property
or
income
however
wealthy
she
may
be
furthermore
it
need
scarcely
be
said
a
servant
who
is
inefficient
lazy
or
otherwise
intolerable
can
be
dismissed
or
her
wage
can
be
lowered
not
so
that
privileged
person
the
legally
wedded
wife
it
matters
not
whether
she
perform
her
duties
well
badly
indifferently
or
not
at
all
the
husband
s
legal
obligations
remain
just
the
same
it
will
be
seen
therefore
that
the
wife
in
any
case
receives
from
the
husband
economic
advantages
compared
with
which
the
wages
of
the
most
highly
paid
servant
in
existence
are
a
mere
pauper
s
pittance
this
talk
we
hear
from
the
feminist
side
of
the
wife
being
an
unpaid
servant
is
typical
of
the
whole
feminist
agitation
we
find
the
same
deliberate
and
unscrupulous
dishonesty
characterising
it
throughout
facts
are
not
merely
perverted
or
exaggerated
they
are
simply
turned
upside
down
another
statement
commonly
made
is
that
women
s
lower
wages
as
compared
with
men
s
is
the
result
of
not
possessing
the
parliamentary
franchise
now
this
statement
though
not
perhaps
bearing
on
its
face
the
wilful
deception
characterising
the
one
just
mentioned
is
not
any
the
less
a
perversion
of
economic
fact
and
we
can
hardly
regard
it
otherwise
than
as
intentional
it
is
quite
clear
that
up
to
date
the
wages
of
men
have
not
been
raised
by
legislation
and
yet
sections
of
the
working
classes
have
possessed
the
franchise
at
least
since
what
legislation
has
done
for
the
men
has
been
simply
to
remove
obstacles
in
the
way
of
industrial
organisation
on
the
part
of
the
workman
in
freeing
the
trade
unions
from
disabilities
and
even
this
was
begun
owing
to
pressure
from
outside
long
long
ago
as
the
twenties
of
the
last
century
under
the
auspices
of
joseph
hume
and
francis
place
now
women
s
unions
enjoy
precisely
the
same
freedom
as
men
s
unions
and
nothing
stands
in
the
way
of
working
women
organising
and
agitating
for
higher
wages
those
who
talk
of
the
franchise
as
being
necessary
for
working
women
in
order
to
obtain
equal
industrial
and
economic
advantages
with
working
men
must
realise
perfectly
well
that
they
are
performing
the
oratorical
operation
colloquially
known
as
talking
through
their
the
reasons
why
the
wages
of
women
workers
are
lower
than
those
of
men
whatever
else
may
be
their
grounds
and
these
are
i
think
pretty
obvious
clearly
are
not
traceable
to
anything
which
the
concession
of
the
franchise
would
remove
if
it
be
suggested
that
a
law
could
be
enacted
compulsorily
enforcing
equal
rates
of
payment
for
women
as
for
men
what
the
result
would
be
the
merest
tyro
in
such
matters
can
wit
that
it
would
mean
the
wholesale
displacement
of
female
by
male
labour
over
large
branches
of
industry
and
this
we
imagine
is
not
precisely
what
the
advocates
of
female
suffrage
are
desirous
of
effecting
male
labour
owing
to
its
greater
efficiency
and
other
causes
being
generally
preferred
by
employers
to
female
labour
it
is
not
likely
that
even
for
the
sake
of
female
they
are
going
to
accept
female
labour
in
the
place
of
male
on
an
equal
wage
basis
all
this
of
course
is
quite
apart
from
the
question
referred
to
on
a
previous
page
as
to
the
economic
responsibilities
in
the
interests
of
women
which
our
feminist
have
saddled
on
the
the
responsibility
of
the
husband
and
the
husband
alone
for
the
maintenance
of
his
wife
and
family
obligations
from
anything
corresponding
to
which
the
female
sex
is
wholly
free
in
a
leaflet
issued
by
the
men
s
federation
for
women
s
suffrage
it
is
affirmed
that
many
laws
are
on
the
statute
book
which
inflict
injustice
on
we
challenge
this
statement
as
an
unmitigated
falsehood
its
makers
ought
to
know
perfectly
well
that
they
can
not
justify
it
there
are
no
laws
on
the
statute
book
inflicting
injustice
on
women
as
a
sex
but
there
are
many
laws
inflicting
injustice
on
men
in
the
supposed
interests
of
women
the
tag
which
has
so
long
done
duty
with
feminists
in
this
the
rule
of
the
divorce
court
that
in
order
to
procure
divorce
a
wife
has
to
prove
cruelty
as
well
as
adultery
on
the
part
of
a
husband
whereas
a
husband
has
to
prove
adultery
alone
on
the
part
of
a
already
been
dealt
with
and
its
rottenness
as
a
specimen
of
a
grievance
sufficiently
exposed
in
this
work
and
elsewhere
by
the
present
writer
is
what
the
authors
of
the
leaflet
may
possibly
have
in
their
mind
if
they
have
anything
at
all
when
they
talk
about
statutes
inflicting
injustice
on
women
that
the
law
does
not
carry
sex
vindictiveness
against
men
far
enough
to
please
them
with
all
its
flogging
penal
servitude
hard
labour
and
the
rest
for
offences
against
women
some
of
them
of
a
comparatively
trivial
kind
does
the
law
as
regards
severity
on
men
not
even
yet
satisfy
the
ferocious
feminist
souls
of
the
members
of
the
men
s
federation
for
women
s
suffrage
this
is
the
only
explanation
of
the
statement
in
question
other
than
that
it
is
sheer
bald
bluff
designed
to
mislead
those
ignorant
of
the
law
another
flagrant
falsehood
perpetually
being
dinned
into
our
ears
by
the
suffragists
is
the
statement
that
have
to
obey
the
same
laws
as
the
conclusion
drawn
from
this
false
statement
is
of
course
that
since
they
have
to
obey
these
laws
equally
with
men
they
have
an
equal
claim
with
men
to
take
part
in
the
making
or
the
modifying
of
them
now
without
pausing
to
consider
the
fallacy
underlying
the
conclusion
we
would
point
out
that
it
is
sufficient
for
our
present
purpose
to
call
attention
to
the
falsity
of
the
initial
assumption
itself
it
needs
only
one
who
follows
current
events
and
reads
his
newspaper
with
impartial
mind
to
see
that
to
allege
that
women
in
the
true
sense
of
the
words
are
compelled
to
obey
the
same
laws
as
men
is
a
glaringly
mendacious
statement
it
is
unnecessary
in
this
place
to
go
over
once
more
the
mass
of
evidence
comprised
in
previous
writings
of
my
in
the
pamphlet
the
legal
subjection
of
man
twentieth
century
press
in
the
article
a
creature
of
privilege
november
and
elsewhere
in
the
present
volume
illustrating
the
unquestionable
fact
that
though
in
theory
women
may
have
to
obey
the
law
as
men
have
yet
in
practice
they
are
absolved
from
all
the
more
serious
consequences
men
have
to
suffer
when
they
disobey
it
the
treatment
recently
accorded
to
the
suffragettes
for
crimes
such
as
wilful
damage
and
arson
not
to
speak
of
their
previous
prison
treatment
when
convicted
for
obstruction
disturbance
and
minor
police
misdemeanours
is
a
proof
writ
large
of
the
mendacity
of
the
statement
that
women
no
less
than
men
have
to
obey
the
laws
of
the
country
so
far
that
is
as
any
real
meaning
is
attached
to
this
phrase
another
suffragist
lie
which
is
invariably
allowed
to
pass
muster
by
default
save
for
an
occasional
protest
by
the
present
writer
is
the
assumption
that
the
english
law
draws
a
distinction
as
regards
prison
treatment
as
between
political
and
offenders
everyone
with
even
the
most
elementary
legal
knowledge
is
aware
that
no
such
distinction
has
ever
been
recognised
or
suggested
by
the
english
least
until
the
prison
ordinance
made
quite
recently
expressly
to
please
the
suffragettes
by
mr
winston
churchill
when
home
secretary
however
desirable
many
may
consider
such
a
distinction
to
be
nothing
is
more
indubitable
than
the
fact
that
it
has
never
previously
obtained
in
the
letter
or
practice
of
the
law
of
england
and
yet
without
a
word
of
contradiction
from
those
who
know
better
arguments
and
protests
galore
have
been
fabricated
on
the
suffragist
side
based
solely
on
this
impudently
false
assumption
misdemeanours
and
crimes
at
common
law
when
wilfully
committed
have
in
all
countries
always
remained
misdemeanours
and
crimes
whatever
motive
can
be
conveniently
put
forward
to
account
for
them
a
political
offence
has
always
meant
the
expression
of
opinions
or
the
advocacy
of
measures
or
acts
not
of
the
nature
of
common
law
crimes
which
are
in
contravention
of
the
existing
a
libel
on
the
constituted
authorities
of
the
state
or
the
forcible
disregard
of
a
law
or
police
regulation
in
hindrance
of
the
right
of
public
speech
or
meeting
this
is
what
is
meant
by
political
offence
in
any
country
recognising
such
as
a
special
class
of
offence
entitling
those
committing
it
to
special
treatment
this
is
so
where
the
matter
refers
to
the
internal
legislation
of
the
country
where
the
question
of
extradition
comes
in
the
definition
of
political
offence
is
of
course
wider
take
the
extreme
case
that
of
the
assassination
of
a
ruler
or
functionary
especially
in
a
despotic
state
where
free
press
and
the
free
expression
of
opinion
generally
do
not
exist
this
is
undoubtedly
a
political
not
a
common
law
offence
so
far
as
other
countries
are
and
hence
the
perpetrator
of
such
a
deed
has
the
right
to
claim
immunity
on
this
ground
from
extradition
the
position
assumable
is
that
under
despotic
conditions
the
progressive
man
is
at
war
with
the
despot
and
those
exercising
authority
under
him
therefore
in
killing
the
despot
or
the
repositories
of
despotic
authority
he
is
striking
directly
at
the
enemy
it
would
however
be
absurd
for
the
agent
in
a
deed
of
this
sort
to
expect
special
political
treatment
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
itself
immediately
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
never
does
so
fancy
a
russian
nihilist
when
brought
to
trial
whining
that
he
is
a
political
offender
and
hence
to
be
exempted
from
all
harsh
treatment
no
the
nihilist
has
too
much
to
make
himself
ridiculous
in
this
way
hardly
even
the
maddest
terrorist
anarchist
would
make
such
a
claim
for
example
the
french
law
recognises
the
distinction
between
political
and
common
law
offences
but
for
all
this
the
bonnot
and
his
associates
did
not
receive
any
benefit
from
the
distinction
or
even
claim
to
do
so
though
otherwise
they
were
loud
enough
in
proclaiming
the
political
motives
inspiring
them
even
as
regards
extradition
running
amuck
at
large
setting
fire
promiscuously
to
private
buildings
or
injuring
the
ordinary
citizen
as
a
protest
would
not
legally
come
into
the
category
of
political
offences
and
hence
protect
their
authors
from
being
surrendered
as
ordinary
criminals
the
real
fact
of
course
is
that
all
this
talk
on
the
part
of
suffragettes
and
their
backers
about
political
offences
and
political
prison
treatment
is
only
a
mean
and
underhand
way
of
trying
to
secure
special
sex
privileges
under
false
pretences
those
who
talk
the
loudest
in
the
strain
in
question
know
this
perfectly
well
these
falsehoods
are
dangerous
in
spite
of
what
one
would
think
ought
to
be
their
obvious
character
as
such
by
reason
of
the
psychological
fact
that
you
only
require
to
repeat
a
lie
often
enough
provided
you
are
uncontradicted
in
order
for
the
aforesaid
lie
to
be
received
as
established
truth
by
the
mass
of
mankind
mostly
fools
as
carlyle
had
it
it
is
a
preposterous
claim
i
contend
that
any
misdemeanour
and
any
felony
has
law
apart
and
even
from
a
merely
ethical
point
of
view
any
claim
to
special
consideration
and
leniency
on
the
bare
declaration
of
the
felon
or
misdemeanant
that
it
had
been
dictated
by
political
motive
in
no
country
at
any
time
has
the
mere
assertion
of
political
motive
been
held
to
bring
an
ordinary
crime
within
the
sphere
of
treatment
of
political
offences
according
to
the
legal
and
ethical
logic
of
the
suffragettes
it
is
perfectly
open
for
them
to
set
on
fire
theatres
churches
and
houses
and
even
to
shoot
down
the
harmless
in
the
street
and
claim
the
treatment
of
misdemeanants
on
the
ground
that
the
act
was
done
as
a
protest
against
some
political
grievance
under
which
they
imagined
themselves
to
be
labouring
the
absurdity
of
the
suggestion
is
evident
on
its
mere
statement
and
yet
the
above
preposterous
assumption
has
been
suffered
equally
with
the
one
last
noted
to
pass
virtually
without
protest
and
what
is
more
serious
it
has
been
acted
upon
by
the
authorities
as
though
it
were
indubitably
sound
law
as
well
as
sound
ethics
it
may
be
pointed
out
that
what
has
cost
many
an
irish
fenian
in
the
old
days
and
many
a
terrorist
anarchist
at
a
later
date
a
sentence
of
penal
servitude
for
life
can
be
indulged
in
by
modern
suffragettes
at
the
expense
of
a
few
weeks
imprisonment
in
the
first
or
second
division
of
course
this
whole
talk
of
political
offences
when
they
are
on
the
face
of
them
mere
common
crimes
is
purely
and
simply
a
trick
designed
to
shield
the
cowardly
and
contemptible
female
creatures
who
perpetrate
these
senseless
and
dastardly
outrages
from
the
punishment
they
deserve
and
would
receive
if
they
had
not
the
good
fortune
to
be
of
the
privileged
sex
in
the
case
of
men
this
impudent
nonsense
would
of
course
never
have
been
put
forward
and
if
it
had
would
have
been
summarily
laughed
out
of
court
that
it
should
be
necessary
to
point
out
these
things
in
so
many
words
is
a
striking
illustration
of
the
moral
and
intellectual
atrophy
produced
by
feminism
in
the
public
mind
there
is
another
falsehood
we
often
hear
by
way
of
condoning
the
infamous
outrages
of
the
suffragettes
the
excuse
is
often
offered
when
the
illogical
pointlessness
of
the
militant
methods
of
the
modern
suffragette
are
in
question
oh
men
have
also
done
the
same
things
men
have
used
violence
to
attain
political
ends
now
the
fallacy
involved
in
this
retort
is
plain
enough
it
may
be
perfectly
true
that
men
have
used
violence
to
attain
their
ends
on
occasion
but
to
assert
this
fact
in
the
connection
in
question
is
purely
irrelevant
there
is
violence
violence
it
is
absolutely
false
to
say
that
men
have
ever
adopted
purposeless
and
inane
violence
a
the
violence
of
men
has
always
had
an
intelligible
relation
to
the
ends
they
had
in
view
either
proximate
or
ultimate
they
pulled
down
hyde
park
railings
in
good
but
why
was
this
because
they
wanted
to
hold
a
meeting
and
found
the
park
closed
against
them
the
destruction
of
the
railings
being
the
only
means
of
gaining
access
to
the
park
again
the
reform
bill
riots
of
were
at
least
all
directed
against
government
property
and
governmental
is
the
enemy
with
whom
they
were
at
war
in
most
cases
as
at
bristol
and
nottingham
there
was
as
in
that
of
the
hyde
park
railings
a
very
definite
and
immediate
object
in
the
violence
and
destruction
the
release
of
persons
imprisoned
for
the
part
they
had
taken
in
the
reform
movement
by
the
destruction
of
the
gaols
where
they
were
confined
what
conceivable
analogy
have
these
things
with
a
policy
of
destroying
private
property
setting
fire
to
tea
pavilions
burning
destroying
private
houses
poisoning
pet
dogs
upsetting
jockeys
defacing
people
s
correspondence
including
the
postal
orders
of
the
poor
mutilating
books
in
a
college
library
pictures
in
a
public
gallery
and
all
these
not
openly
and
in
course
of
a
riot
but
furtively
in
the
pursuit
of
a
deliberately
premeditated
policy
have
i
ask
men
ever
in
the
course
of
the
world
s
history
committed
mean
futile
and
dastardly
crimes
such
as
these
in
pursuit
of
any
political
or
public
end
there
can
be
but
one
answer
to
this
question
every
reader
must
know
that
there
is
no
analogy
whatever
between
suffragettes
militancy
and
the
violence
and
crimes
of
which
men
may
have
been
guilty
even
the
terrorist
anarchist
however
he
may
be
and
however
much
his
deeds
may
be
deemed
morally
reprehensible
is
at
least
logical
in
his
actions
in
so
far
as
the
latter
have
always
had
some
definite
bearing
on
his
political
ends
and
were
not
mere
senseless
running
the
utterly
disconnected
meaningless
and
wanton
character
signalising
the
policy
of
the
militant
suffragettes
would
of
itself
suffice
to
furnish
a
conclusive
argument
for
the
incapacity
of
the
female
intellect
to
think
logically
or
politically
and
hence
against
the
concession
to
women
of
public
powers
political
judicial
or
otherwise
another
fallacy
analogous
to
the
preceding
inasmuch
as
it
seeks
to
counterbalance
female
defects
and
weaknesses
by
the
false
allegation
of
corresponding
deficiencies
in
men
is
the
feminist
retort
sometimes
heard
when
the
question
of
hysteria
in
women
is
raised
oh
men
can
also
suffer
from
hysteria
this
has
been
already
dealt
with
in
an
earlier
chapter
but
for
the
sake
of
completing
the
list
of
prominent
feminist
fallacies
i
restate
it
concisely
here
now
as
we
have
seen
it
is
exceedingly
doubtful
whether
this
statement
is
true
in
any
sense
whatever
there
are
eminent
authorities
who
would
deny
that
men
ever
have
true
hysteria
there
are
others
of
course
again
who
would
extend
the
term
hysteria
so
as
to
include
every
form
of
neurasthenic
disturbance
the
question
is
largely
with
many
persons
who
discuss
the
subject
one
of
terminology
it
suffices
here
to
cut
short
quibbling
on
this
score
for
the
nonce
let
us
drop
the
word
hysteria
and
formulate
the
matter
as
follows
are
frequently
subject
to
a
pathological
mental
condition
differing
in
different
cases
but
offering
certain
features
in
common
a
condition
which
seldom
if
ever
occurs
in
men
this
i
take
to
be
an
incontrovertible
proposition
based
upon
experience
which
will
be
admitted
by
every
impartial
person
now
the
existence
of
the
hysterical
man
i
have
hitherto
found
to
be
attested
on
personal
experience
solely
by
certain
feminist
medical
practitioners
who
allege
that
they
have
met
with
him
in
their
his
existence
is
thus
vouchsafed
for
just
as
the
reality
of
the
is
vouchsafed
for
by
certain
sea
captains
or
other
ancient
mariners
far
be
it
from
me
to
impugn
the
ability
still
less
the
integrity
of
these
worthy
persons
but
in
either
case
i
may
have
my
doubts
as
to
the
accuracy
of
their
observation
or
of
their
diagnosis
it
may
be
that
the
exists
and
it
may
be
that
hysteria
is
at
times
discoverable
in
male
persons
but
while
a
conclusive
proof
of
the
discovery
of
a
single
of
the
orthodox
pattern
would
go
far
to
justify
the
yarn
of
the
ancient
mariner
the
proof
of
the
occurrence
in
an
occasional
case
of
hysteria
in
men
would
not
by
far
justify
the
implied
contention
that
hysteria
is
not
essentially
a
female
malady
if
hysterical
men
are
as
common
a
phenomenon
as
certain
feminists
would
make
out
what
i
want
to
know
is
where
are
they
while
we
come
upon
symptoms
which
would
be
commonly
attributed
to
hysteria
in
every
second
or
third
woman
of
whose
life
we
have
any
intimate
knowledge
how
often
do
we
find
in
men
symptoms
in
any
way
resembling
these
in
my
own
experience
i
have
come
across
but
two
cases
of
men
giving
indications
of
a
temperament
in
any
way
analogous
to
that
of
the
hysterical
after
all
the
experience
of
the
average
layman
and
in
this
i
contend
my
own
is
more
or
less
typical
is
more
important
in
the
case
of
a
malady
manifesting
itself
in
symptoms
obvious
to
common
observation
such
as
the
one
we
are
considering
than
that
of
the
medical
practitioner
who
by
reason
of
his
profession
would
be
especially
likely
to
see
cases
if
there
were
any
at
all
however
few
they
might
be
the
possibility
moreover
at
least
suggests
itself
that
the
latter
may
often
mistake
for
hysteria
using
the
word
in
the
sense
commonly
applied
to
the
symptoms
presented
by
women
symptoms
resulting
from
general
neurasthenia
or
even
from
purely
extraneous
causes
such
as
alcohol
drugs
etc
that
this
is
sometimes
the
case
is
hardly
open
to
question
that
the
pathological
mental
symptoms
referred
to
as
prevalent
in
the
female
whether
we
attribute
them
to
hysteria
or
not
are
rarely
if
ever
found
in
the
male
sex
is
an
undoubted
fact
the
rose
it
is
said
is
as
sweet
by
any
other
name
and
whether
we
term
these
affections
symptoms
of
hysteria
or
describe
them
as
hysteria
itself
or
deny
that
they
have
anything
to
go
with
true
hysteria
their
existence
and
frequency
in
the
female
sex
remains
nevertheless
a
fact
no
whether
some
of
the
symptoms
of
hysteria
true
or
are
occasionally
to
be
found
in
men
or
not
every
impartial
person
must
admit
that
they
are
extremely
rare
whereas
as
regards
certain
pathological
mental
symptoms
common
in
women
and
popularly
identified
rightly
or
wrongly
with
hysteria
there
is
i
contend
little
evidence
of
their
occurring
in
men
at
all
wriggle
and
prevaricate
as
they
may
it
is
impossible
for
suffragists
and
feminists
to
successfully
evade
the
undoubted
truth
that
the
mentality
of
women
is
characterised
constitutionally
by
a
general
instability
manifesting
itself
in
pathological
symptoms
radically
differing
in
nature
and
in
frequency
from
any
that
obtain
in
men
very
conspicuous
among
the
fallacies
that
have
done
yeoman
service
in
the
feminist
movement
is
the
assumption
that
women
are
constitutionally
the
weaker
this
has
also
been
discussed
by
us
in
chapter
but
the
latter
may
again
be
supplemented
here
by
a
few
further
remarks
so
deeply
rooted
is
this
fallacy
in
public
opinion
the
reason
of
the
unquestioned
acceptance
of
the
assumption
is
partly
due
to
a
confusion
of
two
things
under
one
name
the
terms
bodily
strength
and
bodily
weakness
cover
two
distinct
facts
the
attribution
of
greater
bodily
weakness
to
the
female
sex
than
to
the
male
undoubtedly
expresses
a
truth
but
no
less
does
the
attribution
of
greater
bodily
strength
to
the
female
than
to
the
male
sex
equally
express
a
truth
in
size
weight
and
muscular
development
average
man
has
an
unquestionable
and
in
most
cases
enormous
advantage
over
average
woman
it
is
in
this
sense
that
the
bodily
structure
of
the
human
female
can
with
some
show
of
justice
be
described
as
frail
on
the
other
hand
as
regards
tenacity
of
life
recuperative
power
and
what
we
may
term
toughness
of
constitution
woman
is
without
doubt
considerably
stronger
than
man
now
this
vigour
of
constitution
may
of
course
also
be
described
as
bodily
strength
and
to
this
confusion
the
assumption
of
the
general
frailty
of
the
female
bodily
organism
as
compared
with
the
male
has
acquired
general
currency
in
the
popular
mind
the
most
carefully
controlled
and
reliable
statistics
of
the
and
other
sources
show
the
enormously
greater
mortality
of
men
than
of
women
at
all
ages
and
under
all
conditions
of
life
under
the
age
of
five
the
evidence
shows
that
boys
die
to
every
girls
in
adult
life
the
shows
that
diseases
of
the
chest
are
the
cause
of
nearly
per
cent
more
deaths
among
men
than
among
women
that
violence
and
accident
should
be
the
occasion
of
per
cent
more
deaths
amongst
men
than
women
is
accounted
for
partly
at
least
by
the
greater
exposure
of
men
although
the
enormous
disparity
would
lead
one
to
suspect
that
here
also
the
inferior
resisting
power
in
the
male
constitution
plays
a
not
inconsiderable
part
in
the
result
the
report
of
the
medical
officer
to
the
local
government
board
proves
that
between
the
ages
of
and
there
is
a
startling
difference
in
numbers
between
the
deaths
of
men
and
those
of
women
the
details
for
the
year
are
as
follows
diseases
males
females
nervous
system
heart
blood
vessels
respiratory
system
digestive
system
kidneys
etc
acute
infections
violent
deaths
various
additional
causes
connected
with
the
more
active
and
anxious
life
of
men
the
greater
strain
to
which
they
are
subjected
their
greater
exposure
alike
to
infection
and
to
accident
may
explain
a
certain
percentage
of
the
excessive
of
the
male
population
as
opposed
to
the
female
yet
these
explanations
even
allowing
the
utmost
possible
latitude
to
them
really
only
touch
the
fringe
of
the
difference
with
the
single
exception
of
deaths
from
violence
and
accident
above
alluded
to
where
liability
and
exposure
may
account
for
a
somewhat
larger
percentage
the
great
cause
of
the
discrepancy
remains
without
doubt
the
enormously
greater
potentiality
of
resistance
in
other
words
of
constitutional
strength
in
the
female
bodily
organism
as
compared
with
the
male
we
must
now
deal
at
some
length
with
a
fallacy
of
some
importance
owing
to
the
apparatus
of
learning
with
which
it
has
been
set
forth
to
be
found
in
mr
lester
ward
s
book
entitled
pure
sociology
notwithstanding
that
its
fallacious
nature
is
plain
enough
when
analysed
mr
ward
terms
his
speculation
the
gynœcocentric
theory
by
which
he
understands
apparently
the
feminist
dogma
of
the
supreme
importance
of
the
female
in
the
scheme
of
humanity
and
nature
generally
his
arguments
are
largely
drawn
from
general
biology
especially
that
of
inferior
organisms
he
traces
the
various
processes
of
reproduction
in
the
lower
departments
of
organic
nature
subdivision
germination
budding
up
to
the
earlier
forms
of
culminating
in
conjugation
or
true
sexual
union
his
standpoint
he
thus
states
in
the
terms
of
biological
origins
although
reproduction
and
sex
are
two
distinct
things
and
although
a
creature
that
reproduces
without
sex
can
not
properly
be
called
either
male
or
female
still
so
completely
have
these
conceptions
become
blended
in
the
popular
mind
that
a
creature
which
actually
brings
forth
offspring
out
of
its
own
body
is
instinctively
classed
as
female
the
female
is
the
fertile
sex
and
whatever
is
fertile
is
looked
upon
as
female
assuredly
it
would
be
absurd
to
look
upon
an
organism
propagating
sexually
as
male
biologists
have
proceeded
from
this
popular
standpoint
and
regularly
speak
of
mother
cells
and
daughter
it
therefore
does
no
violence
to
language
or
to
science
to
say
that
life
begins
with
the
female
organism
and
is
carried
on
a
long
distance
by
means
of
females
alone
in
all
the
different
forms
of
reproduction
from
fission
to
parthenogenesis
the
female
may
in
this
sense
be
said
to
exist
alone
and
perform
all
the
functions
of
life
including
reproduction
in
a
word
life
begins
as
in
the
above
remarks
it
will
be
seen
that
mr
ward
so
to
say
jumps
the
claim
of
organisms
to
be
considered
as
female
this
in
itself
a
somewhat
questionable
proceeding
serves
him
as
a
for
his
theory
the
female
he
observes
is
not
only
primarily
the
original
sex
but
continues
throughout
the
main
trunk
though
afterwards
the
male
element
is
added
for
the
purposes
of
among
millions
of
humble
creatures
says
mr
ward
the
male
is
simply
and
solely
a
the
writer
goes
on
in
his
efforts
to
belittle
the
male
sex
in
the
sphere
of
biology
the
gigantic
female
spider
and
the
tiny
male
fertiliser
the
mantis
insect
with
its
similarly
large
and
ferocious
female
bees
and
mosquitoes
all
are
pressed
into
the
service
even
the
vegetable
kingdom
in
so
far
as
it
shows
signs
of
sex
differentiation
is
brought
into
the
lists
in
favour
of
his
theory
of
female
supremacy
or
gynœcocentricism
as
he
terms
it
this
theory
may
be
briefly
stated
as
follows
the
earliest
organisms
displaying
sex
differentiation
it
is
the
female
which
represents
the
organism
proper
the
rudimentary
male
existing
solely
for
the
purpose
of
the
fertilisation
of
the
female
this
applies
to
most
of
the
lower
forms
of
life
in
which
the
differentiation
of
sex
obtains
and
in
many
insects
the
mantis
being
one
of
the
cases
specially
insisted
upon
by
our
author
the
process
of
the
development
of
the
male
sex
is
by
means
of
the
sexual
selection
of
the
female
from
being
a
mere
fertilising
agent
gradually
as
evolution
proceeds
it
assumes
the
form
and
characteristics
of
an
independent
organism
like
the
original
female
trunk
organism
but
the
latter
continues
to
maintain
its
supremacy
in
the
life
of
the
species
by
means
chiefly
of
sexual
selection
until
the
human
period
more
or
less
for
mr
ward
is
bound
to
admit
signs
of
male
superiority
in
the
higher
birds
and
mammals
this
superiority
manifests
itself
in
size
strength
ornamentation
alertness
etc
but
it
is
with
man
with
the
advent
of
the
reasoning
faculty
and
as
a
consequence
of
human
supremacy
that
it
becomes
first
unmistakably
manifest
this
superiority
mr
ward
contends
has
been
developed
under
the
ægis
of
the
sexual
selection
of
the
female
and
enabled
cruel
and
wicked
man
to
subject
and
enslave
and
oppressed
woman
who
has
thus
been
crushed
by
a
frankenstein
of
her
own
creation
although
in
various
earlier
phases
of
human
organisation
woman
still
maintains
her
social
supremacy
this
state
of
affairs
soon
changes
androcracy
establishes
itself
and
woman
is
reduced
to
the
rôle
of
breeding
the
race
and
of
being
the
servant
of
man
thus
she
has
remained
throughout
the
periods
of
the
higher
barbarism
and
of
civilisation
our
author
regards
the
lowest
point
of
what
he
terms
the
degradation
of
woman
to
have
been
reached
in
the
past
and
the
last
two
centuries
as
having
witnessed
a
movement
in
the
opposite
towards
the
emancipation
of
woman
and
equality
between
the
sexes
pure
sociology
chap
and
especially
pp
the
above
is
a
brief
but
i
think
not
unfair
skeleton
statement
of
the
theory
which
mr
lester
ward
has
elaborated
in
the
work
above
referred
to
in
great
detail
and
with
immense
wealth
of
illustration
but
now
i
ask
granting
the
correctness
of
mr
ward
s
biological
premises
and
the
accuracy
of
his
exposition
and
i
am
not
specialist
enough
to
be
capable
of
criticising
these
in
detail
what
does
it
all
amount
to
the
business
end
as
the
americans
would
say
of
the
whole
theory
it
is
quite
evident
is
to
afford
a
plausible
and
scientific
basis
for
the
modern
feminist
movement
and
thus
to
further
its
practical
pretensions
what
mr
ward
terms
the
androcentric
theory
at
least
as
regards
man
and
the
higher
vertebrates
which
is
on
the
face
of
it
supported
by
the
facts
of
human
experience
and
has
been
accepted
unanimously
up
to
quite
recent
times
is
according
to
him
all
wrong
the
male
element
in
the
universe
of
living
things
is
not
the
element
of
primary
importance
and
the
female
element
the
secondary
but
the
converse
is
the
case
for
this
contention
mr
ward
as
already
pointed
out
has
by
dint
of
his
biological
learning
succeeded
at
least
in
making
out
a
case
so
far
as
lower
forms
of
life
are
he
has
however
to
fatal
admission
evolution
has
tended
progressively
to
break
down
the
superiority
of
the
female
by
means
as
he
contends
of
her
own
sexual
selection
and
to
transfer
sex
supremacy
to
the
male
according
to
mr
ward
hitherto
a
secondary
being
and
that
this
tendency
becomes
very
obvious
in
most
species
of
birds
and
mammals
with
the
rise
of
man
however
out
of
the
the
or
by
whatever
other
designation
we
may
call
the
intermediate
organism
between
the
purely
animal
and
the
purely
human
and
the
consequent
supersession
of
instinct
as
the
dominant
form
of
intelligence
by
reason
the
question
of
superiority
as
mr
ward
candidly
admits
is
no
longer
doubtful
and
upon
the
unquestionable
superiority
of
the
male
in
due
course
of
time
follows
the
unquestioned
supremacy
it
is
clear
then
that
granting
the
biological
premises
of
our
author
that
the
lowest
sexual
organisms
are
virtually
female
and
that
in
the
hermaphrodites
the
female
element
predominates
that
in
the
earliest
forms
of
the
fertilising
or
male
element
was
merely
an
offshoot
of
the
female
trunk
and
that
this
offshoot
develops
mainly
by
means
of
sexual
selection
on
the
part
of
the
female
into
an
organism
similar
to
the
latter
that
not
until
we
reach
the
higher
vertebrates
the
birds
and
the
mammals
do
we
find
any
traces
of
male
superiority
and
that
this
superiority
only
becomes
definite
and
obvious
leading
to
male
domination
in
the
human
all
this
i
say
what
argument
can
be
founded
upon
it
in
support
of
the
equal
value
physically
intellectually
and
morally
of
the
female
sex
in
human
society
or
the
desirability
of
its
possessing
equal
political
power
with
men
in
such
society
on
the
contrary
mr
ward
s
whole
exposition
with
his
biological
facts
of
illustration
would
seem
to
point
rather
in
the
opposite
direction
we
seem
surely
to
have
here
if
mr
ward
s
premises
be
accepted
as
to
the
primitive
insignificance
of
the
male
first
overshadowed
and
dominated
by
the
female
stem
but
gradually
evolving
in
importance
character
and
fruition
till
we
arrive
at
man
the
highest
product
of
evolution
up
to
powerful
argument
for
on
mr
ward
s
own
showing
we
find
that
incontestible
superiority
both
in
size
and
power
of
body
and
brain
has
manifested
itself
in
androcracy
when
the
female
is
relegated
in
the
natural
course
of
things
to
the
function
of
this
it
can
hardly
be
denied
is
simply
one
more
instance
of
the
general
process
of
evolution
whereby
the
higher
being
is
evolved
from
the
lower
at
first
weak
and
dependent
upon
its
parent
the
latter
remaining
dominant
until
the
new
being
reaches
maturity
when
in
its
turn
it
becomes
supreme
while
that
out
of
which
it
developed
and
of
which
it
was
first
the
mere
offshoot
falls
into
the
background
and
becomes
in
its
turn
subordinate
to
its
own
product
let
us
turn
now
to
another
scientific
fallacy
the
result
of
a
good
man
struggling
with
a
sound
and
honest
scientific
investigator
but
one
who
at
the
same
time
is
either
himself
obsessed
with
the
principles
of
feminism
as
with
a
religious
dogma
or
else
is
nervously
afraid
of
offending
others
who
are
his
attitude
reminds
one
of
nothing
so
much
as
that
of
the
orthodox
geologist
of
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
who
wrote
in
mortal
fear
of
incurring
the
by
his
exposition
of
the
facts
of
geology
and
who
was
therefore
nervously
anxious
to
persuade
his
readers
that
the
facts
in
question
did
not
clash
with
the
mosaic
cosmogony
as
given
in
the
book
of
genesis
with
mr
havelock
ellis
in
his
work
man
and
woman
it
is
not
the
dogma
of
biblical
infallibility
that
he
is
concerned
to
defend
but
a
more
modern
dogma
that
of
female
equality
so
dear
to
the
heart
of
the
modern
feminist
mr
ellis
s
efforts
to
evade
the
consequences
of
the
scientific
truths
he
honestly
proclaims
are
almost
pathetic
one
can
not
help
noticing
after
his
exposition
of
some
fact
that
goes
dead
against
the
theory
as
contended
for
by
feminists
the
eagerness
with
which
he
hastens
to
add
some
qualifying
statement
tending
to
show
that
after
all
it
is
not
so
incompatible
with
the
feminist
dogma
as
it
might
appear
at
first
sight
the
de
however
of
mr
havelock
ellis
is
contained
in
his
the
author
has
for
his
problem
to
get
over
the
obvious
incompatibility
of
the
truth
he
has
himself
abundantly
demonstrated
in
the
course
of
his
book
that
the
in
every
respect
physiological
and
psychological
approaches
the
while
the
in
its
proper
progress
towards
maturity
increasingly
diverges
from
it
the
obvious
implication
of
this
fact
is
surely
plain
on
the
principle
of
the
development
of
the
individual
being
a
shorthand
reproduction
of
the
evolution
of
the
species
or
to
express
it
in
scientific
phraseology
of
being
the
abbreviated
recapitulation
of
the
stages
presented
by
if
we
proceed
on
this
and
otherwise
universally
accepted
principle
of
biology
the
inference
is
clear
wit
that
woman
is
as
herbert
spencer
and
others
have
pointed
out
simply
undeveloped
man
other
words
that
woman
represents
a
lower
stage
of
evolution
than
man
now
this
would
obviously
not
at
all
suit
the
book
of
mr
ellis
s
feminism
explained
away
it
has
to
be
in
some
fashion
or
other
so
our
author
is
driven
to
the
daring
expedient
of
throwing
overboard
one
of
the
best
established
generalisations
of
modern
biology
and
boldly
declaring
that
the
principle
contained
therein
is
reversed
we
suppose
for
this
occasion
only
in
the
case
of
man
in
this
way
he
is
enabled
to
postulate
a
theory
consoling
to
the
feminist
soul
which
affirms
that
adult
man
is
nearer
in
point
of
development
to
his
ancestor
than
either
the
child
or
the
woman
the
physiological
and
psychological
analogies
observable
between
the
child
and
the
savage
and
even
especially
in
early
childhood
between
the
child
and
the
lower
mammalian
which
notably
in
the
life
of
instinct
and
passion
are
traceable
readily
also
in
the
human
these
count
for
nothing
they
are
not
dreamt
of
in
mr
ellis
s
feminist
philosophy
the
modern
feminist
dogma
requires
that
woman
should
be
recognised
as
equal
in
every
respect
except
in
muscular
strength
with
man
and
if
possible
as
rather
superior
to
him
if
nature
has
not
worked
on
feminist
lines
as
common
observation
and
scientific
research
alike
testify
on
the
face
of
things
naughty
nature
must
be
corrected
in
theory
at
least
by
the
ingenuity
of
feminist
savants
of
the
degraded
male
persuasion
to
this
end
we
must
square
our
scientific
hypotheses
the
startling
theory
of
mr
havelock
ellis
which
must
seem
one
would
think
to
all
impartial
persons
so
out
of
accord
with
all
the
acknowledged
laws
and
facts
of
biological
science
appears
to
the
present
writer
it
must
be
confessed
the
very
ad
of
feminist
controversial
perversity
i
will
conclude
this
chapter
on
feminist
lies
and
fallacies
with
a
fallacy
of
false
analogy
or
false
illustration
according
as
we
may
choose
to
term
it
this
was
recently
put
forward
in
a
defence
speech
by
one
of
the
prisoners
in
a
suffragette
trial
and
was
subsequently
repeated
by
george
bernard
shaw
in
a
letter
to
put
briefly
the
point
attempted
to
be
made
is
as
follows
men
it
is
said
how
would
you
like
it
if
the
historical
relations
of
the
sexes
were
reversed
if
the
making
and
the
administrating
of
the
laws
and
the
whole
power
of
the
state
were
in
the
hands
of
women
would
not
you
revolt
in
such
a
condition
of
affairs
now
to
this
the
reply
is
sufficiently
clear
the
moral
intended
to
be
conveyed
in
the
hypothetical
question
put
is
that
women
have
just
as
much
right
to
object
to
men
s
domination
as
men
would
have
to
object
to
women
s
domination
but
it
is
plain
that
the
point
of
the
whole
question
resides
in
a
wit
in
the
assumption
that
those
challenged
admit
equal
intellectual
capacity
and
equal
moral
stability
as
between
the
average
woman
and
the
average
man
failing
this
assumption
the
challenge
becomes
senseless
and
futile
if
we
ignore
mental
and
moral
differences
it
is
only
a
question
of
degree
as
to
when
we
are
landed
in
obvious
absurdity
in
gulliver
s
travels
we
have
a
picture
of
society
in
which
horses
ruled
the
roost
and
lorded
it
over
human
beings
in
this
satire
swift
in
effect
put
the
question
how
would
you
humans
like
to
be
treated
by
horses
as
inferiors
just
as
horses
are
treated
by
you
i
am
be
it
remembered
not
instituting
any
comparison
between
the
two
cases
beyond
pointing
out
that
the
argument
as
an
argument
is
intrinsically
the
same
in
both
chapter
vii
the
psychology
of
the
movement
we
have
already
spoken
of
two
strains
in
modern
feminism
which
although
commonly
found
together
are
nevertheless
intrinsically
distinguishable
the
first
i
have
termed
sentimental
feminism
and
the
second
political
feminism
sentimental
feminism
is
in
the
main
an
extension
and
emotional
elaboration
of
the
old
notion
of
chivalry
a
notion
which
in
the
period
when
it
was
supposed
to
have
been
at
its
zenith
certainly
played
a
very
much
smaller
part
in
human
affairs
than
it
does
in
its
extended
and
metamorphosed
form
in
the
present
day
we
have
already
analysed
in
a
former
chapter
the
notion
of
chivalry
taken
in
its
most
general
and
barest
form
it
represents
the
consideration
for
weakness
which
is
very
apt
to
degenerate
into
a
worship
of
mere
weakness
faiblesse
prime
le
is
not
necessarily
nearer
justice
than
force
prime
le
although
to
hear
much
of
the
talk
in
the
present
day
one
would
imagine
that
the
inherent
right
of
the
weak
to
oppress
the
strong
were
a
first
principle
of
eternal
rectitude
but
the
theory
of
chivalry
is
scarcely
invoked
in
the
present
day
save
in
the
interests
of
one
particular
form
of
the
woman
as
the
muscularly
weaker
sex
and
here
it
has
acquired
an
utterly
different
character
as
regards
this
point
it
should
be
remarked
that
mediæval
chivalry
tolerated
as
wharton
expressed
it
in
his
history
of
poetry
the
grossest
indecencies
and
obscenities
between
the
sexes
such
things
as
modern
puritanism
would
stigmatise
with
such
words
as
unchivalrous
unmanly
and
the
like
the
resemblance
between
the
modern
worship
of
women
and
the
relations
of
the
mediæval
knight
to
the
female
sex
is
very
thin
indeed
modern
claims
to
immunity
for
women
from
the
criminal
law
and
mediæval
chivalry
are
quite
different
things
chivalry
as
understood
by
modern
sentimental
feminism
means
unlimited
licence
for
women
in
their
relations
with
men
and
unlimited
coercion
for
men
in
their
relations
with
women
to
men
all
duties
and
no
rights
to
women
all
rights
and
no
duties
is
the
basic
principle
underlying
modern
feminism
suffragism
and
the
bastard
chivalry
it
is
so
fond
of
invoking
the
most
insistent
female
shrieker
for
equality
between
the
sexes
among
political
feminists
it
is
interesting
to
observe
will
in
most
cases
on
occasion
be
found
an
equally
insistent
advocate
of
the
claims
of
sentimental
feminism
based
on
modern
metamorphosed
notions
of
chivalry
it
never
seems
to
strike
anyone
that
the
muscular
weakness
of
woman
has
been
forged
by
modern
feminists
into
an
abominable
weapon
of
tyranny
under
cover
of
the
notion
of
chivalry
as
understood
by
modern
feminism
political
and
sentimental
feminists
alike
would
deprive
men
of
the
most
elementary
rights
of
against
women
and
would
exonerate
the
latter
practically
from
all
punishment
for
the
most
dastardly
crimes
against
men
they
know
they
can
rely
upon
the
support
of
the
sentimental
section
of
public
opinion
with
some
such
parrot
cry
of
what
hit
a
woman
why
not
if
she
molests
you
treat
a
woman
in
this
way
shame
responds
automatically
the
crowd
of
sentimental
feminist
idiots
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
the
real
shame
lies
in
their
endorsement
of
an
iniquitous
sex
privilege
if
the
same
crowd
were
prepared
to
condemn
any
special
form
of
punishment
or
mode
of
treatment
as
inhumane
for
both
sexes
alike
there
would
of
course
be
nothing
to
be
said
but
it
is
not
so
the
most
savage
cruelty
and
vindictive
animosity
towards
men
leaves
them
comparatively
cold
at
most
evoking
a
mild
remonstrance
as
against
the
inflated
manifestation
of
sentimental
horror
and
frothy
indignation
produced
by
any
slight
hardship
inflicted
by
way
of
punishment
let
us
say
on
a
female
offender
the
psychology
of
sentimental
feminism
generally
is
intimately
bound
up
with
the
curious
phenomenon
of
the
hatred
of
men
by
their
own
sex
as
such
with
women
in
spite
of
what
is
sometimes
alleged
one
does
not
find
this
phenomenon
of
on
the
contrary
nowadays
we
are
in
presence
of
a
powerful
female
indicating
the
beginnings
of
a
strong
of
women
against
men
but
with
men
as
already
said
in
all
cases
of
conflict
between
the
sexes
we
are
met
with
a
callous
indifference
alternating
with
positive
hostility
towards
their
which
seems
at
times
to
kill
in
them
all
sense
of
justice
this
is
complemented
on
the
other
side
by
an
imbecile
softness
towards
the
female
sex
in
general
which
reminds
one
of
nothing
so
much
as
of
the
maudlin
of
the
amiable
drunkard
this
besotted
indulgence
as
before
noted
is
proof
even
against
the
outraged
sense
of
injury
to
property
as
we
all
know
offences
against
property
as
a
rule
are
those
the
average
bourgeois
is
least
inclined
to
condone
yet
we
have
recently
seen
a
campaign
of
deliberate
wanton
destruction
by
arson
and
other
means
directed
expressly
against
private
property
which
nevertheless
the
respectable
propertied
bourgeois
the
man
of
law
and
order
has
taken
pretty
much
lying
let
us
suppose
another
case
let
us
imagine
an
anarchist
agitation
with
a
known
centre
and
known
leaders
a
centre
from
which
daily
outrages
were
deliberately
planned
by
these
leaders
and
carried
out
by
their
emissaries
all
of
the
male
persuasion
now
what
attitude
does
the
reader
suppose
public
opinion
of
the
propertied
classes
would
adopt
towards
the
miscreants
who
were
responsible
for
these
acts
can
he
not
picture
to
himself
the
furious
indignation
the
rabid
diatribes
the
advocacy
of
hanging
flogging
penal
servitude
for
life
as
the
minimum
punishment
followed
by
panic
legislation
on
these
lines
which
would
ensue
as
a
consequence
yet
of
such
threatenings
and
slaughter
where
suffragettes
who
imitate
the
policy
of
the
terrorist
anarchist
are
concerned
we
hear
not
a
sound
the
respectable
propertied
bourgeois
the
man
of
law
and
order
will
it
is
true
probably
condemn
these
outrages
in
an
academic
way
but
there
is
an
undernote
of
hesitancy
which
damps
down
the
fire
of
his
indignation
there
is
no
vindictiveness
no
note
of
atrocity
in
his
expostulations
nay
he
is
even
prepared
on
occasion
to
argue
the
question
while
maintaining
the
impropriety
the
foolishness
the
unwomanliness
of
setting
fire
to
empty
houses
cutting
up
golf
links
destroying
correspondence
smashing
windows
and
the
like
but
of
fiery
indignation
of
lurid
advocacy
of
barbaric
punishments
or
of
ferocity
in
general
we
have
not
a
trace
on
the
contrary
a
certain
willingness
to
admit
and
even
to
emphasise
the
disinterestedness
of
these
female
criminals
is
observable
as
regards
this
last
point
we
must
again
insist
on
what
was
pointed
out
on
a
previous
page
that
the
disinterestedness
and
unselfishness
of
many
a
male
anarchist
who
has
come
in
for
the
righteous
bourgeois
sternest
indignation
are
at
least
as
unquestionable
as
those
of
the
female
and
moreover
the
anarchist
however
he
may
have
been
in
his
action
as
once
before
remarked
it
must
not
be
forgotten
had
at
least
for
the
goal
of
his
endeavours
not
merely
the
acquirement
of
a
vote
but
the
revolution
which
he
conceived
would
abolish
human
misery
and
raise
humanity
to
a
higher
level
in
this
strange
phenomenon
therefore
in
which
the
indignation
of
the
bourgeois
at
the
wanton
and
wilful
violation
of
the
sacredness
of
his
idol
is
reduced
to
mild
remonstrance
and
its
punitive
action
to
a
playful
pretence
we
have
a
crucial
instance
of
the
extraordinary
influence
of
feminism
over
the
modern
mind
that
the
propertied
classes
should
take
arson
and
wilful
destruction
of
property
in
general
with
such
comparative
equanimity
because
the
culprits
are
women
acting
in
the
assumed
interest
of
a
cause
that
aims
at
increasing
the
influence
of
women
in
the
state
is
the
most
striking
illustration
we
can
have
of
the
power
of
feminism
we
have
here
a
double
phenomenon
the
unreasoning
hatred
of
man
as
a
sex
by
men
and
their
equally
unreasoning
indulgence
towards
the
other
sex
as
we
indicated
above
not
only
is
the
sense
of
de
entirely
absent
among
modern
men
as
regards
their
own
sex
while
strongly
present
in
modern
women
but
this
negative
characteristic
has
become
positive
on
the
other
side
thus
the
modern
sex
problem
presents
us
with
a
reversal
of
the
ordinary
sociological
law
of
the
solidarity
of
those
possessing
common
interests
it
remains
to
consider
the
psychological
explanation
of
this
fact
why
should
men
so
conspicuously
prefer
the
interests
of
women
before
those
of
their
own
sex
that
this
is
the
case
with
modern
man
the
history
of
the
legislation
of
the
last
fifty
years
shows
and
the
undoubted
fact
may
be
found
further
illustrated
in
the
newspaper
reports
of
every
trial
whether
at
civil
or
criminal
law
quite
apart
from
the
ordinary
chivalric
acts
of
men
in
the
detail
of
social
life
this
question
of
sex
therefore
as
before
said
forms
the
solitary
exception
to
the
general
law
of
the
de
of
those
possessing
common
characteristics
and
interests
it
can
not
be
adequately
explained
by
a
reference
to
the
evolution
of
sex
functions
and
relations
from
primitive
man
onwards
since
it
is
at
least
in
the
extreme
form
we
see
it
a
comparatively
recent
social
phenomenon
the
theory
of
the
sacrosanctity
of
women
by
virtue
of
their
sex
quite
apart
from
their
character
and
conduct
as
individuals
scarcely
dates
back
farther
than
a
century
even
from
its
beginnings
the
earlier
chivalry
where
it
obtained
at
all
applied
only
to
the
woman
who
presented
what
were
conceived
of
as
the
ideal
moral
feminine
characteristics
in
some
appreciable
degree
the
mere
physical
fact
of
sex
was
never
for
a
moment
regarded
as
of
itself
sufficient
to
entitle
the
woman
to
any
special
homage
consideration
or
immunity
over
and
above
the
man
no
one
suggested
that
the
female
criminal
was
less
guilty
or
more
excusable
than
the
male
criminal
no
one
believed
that
a
woman
had
a
vested
right
to
rob
or
swindle
a
man
because
she
had
had
sexual
relations
with
him
this
notion
of
the
mere
fact
of
of
itself
constituting
a
title
to
special
privileges
and
immunities
apart
from
any
other
consideration
is
a
product
of
very
recent
times
in
treating
this
question
in
so
far
as
it
bears
on
the
criminal
law
it
is
important
to
distinguish
carefully
between
the
softening
of
the
whole
system
of
punishment
due
to
the
general
development
of
humanitarian
tendencies
and
the
special
discrimination
made
in
favour
of
the
female
sex
these
two
things
are
very
often
inadequately
distinguished
from
one
another
punishment
may
have
become
more
humane
where
men
are
concerned
it
may
have
advanced
up
to
a
certain
point
in
this
direction
but
its
character
is
not
essentially
changed
as
regards
women
however
the
whole
conception
of
criminal
punishment
and
penal
discipline
has
altered
sex
privilege
has
been
now
definitely
established
as
a
principle
now
a
complete
investigation
of
the
psychology
of
this
curious
phenomenon
we
have
been
the
hatred
so
common
with
men
for
their
as
a
a
task
which
has
never
yet
been
properly
taken
in
hand
its
obverse
side
is
to
be
seen
on
all
hands
in
the
conferring
and
confirming
of
sex
prerogative
on
women
not
very
long
ago
as
we
have
seen
one
of
its
most
striking
manifestations
came
strongly
under
public
the
rule
of
the
sea
by
which
women
by
virtue
of
their
sex
can
claim
to
be
saved
from
a
sinking
ship
before
men
the
fact
that
the
laws
and
practices
in
which
this
and
find
expression
are
contrary
to
every
elementary
sense
of
justice
in
many
cases
conflict
with
public
policy
and
can
obviously
be
seen
to
be
purely
arbitrary
matters
not
the
majority
of
men
feel
no
of
the
injustice
although
they
may
admit
the
fact
of
the
injustice
when
categorically
questioned
they
are
prepared
when
it
comes
to
the
point
to
let
public
policy
go
by
the
board
rather
than
entrench
upon
the
sacred
privilege
and
immunity
of
the
female
while
as
to
the
arbitrary
and
unreasoning
nature
of
the
aforesaid
laws
and
practices
not
being
troubled
with
a
logical
conscience
this
does
not
affect
them
i
must
confess
to
being
unequal
to
the
task
of
accurately
fathoming
the
psychological
condition
of
the
average
man
who
hates
man
in
general
and
loves
woman
in
general
to
the
extent
of
going
contrary
to
so
many
apparently
basal
tendencies
of
human
nature
as
we
know
it
otherwise
the
reply
of
course
will
be
an
appeal
to
the
power
of
the
sexual
instinct
but
this
i
must
again
repeat
will
not
explain
the
rise
or
if
not
the
rise
at
least
the
marked
expansion
of
the
sentiment
in
question
during
the
last
three
generations
or
thereabouts
even
apart
from
this
while
i
am
well
aware
of
the
power
of
sexual
love
to
effect
anything
in
the
mind
of
man
as
regards
its
individual
object
i
submit
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
how
it
can
influence
so
strongly
men
s
attitude
towards
women
they
have
not
seen
or
even
where
they
have
seen
them
when
there
is
no
question
of
sexual
attraction
or
again
as
regards
the
collectivity
of
abstract
category
woman
in
general
we
have
already
dealt
with
the
campaign
in
the
press
especially
in
modern
novels
and
plays
this
as
we
have
remarked
often
takes
the
form
of
direct
abuse
of
husbands
and
lovers
and
the
attempt
to
make
them
look
ridiculous
as
a
foil
to
the
brilliant
qualities
of
wives
and
sweethearts
but
we
sometimes
find
the
mere
laudation
of
woman
herself
apart
from
any
direct
assume
the
character
of
an
intellectual
emetic
a
contemporary
novelist
depicting
a
wedding
ceremony
in
fashionable
society
circles
describes
the
feelings
of
his
hero
a
young
man
disgusted
with
the
hollowness
and
vanity
of
society
and
all
its
ways
as
follows
the
bride
was
opposite
him
now
and
by
an
instinct
of
common
chivalry
he
turned
away
his
eyes
it
seemed
to
him
a
shame
to
look
at
that
downcast
head
above
the
silver
mystery
of
her
perfect
raiment
the
modest
head
full
doubtless
of
devotion
and
pure
yearnings
the
stately
head
where
no
such
thought
as
how
am
i
looking
this
day
of
all
days
before
all
london
had
ever
entered
the
proud
head
where
no
such
fear
as
how
am
i
carrying
it
off
could
surely
be
besmirching
he
saw
below
the
surface
of
this
drama
played
before
his
eyes
and
set
his
face
as
a
man
might
who
found
himself
assisting
at
a
now
i
ask
can
it
be
believed
that
the
writer
of
the
above
flamboyant
feminist
fustian
is
a
novelist
and
playwright
of
established
reputation
who
undoubtedly
has
done
good
work
the
obvious
criticism
must
surely
strike
every
reader
that
it
is
somewhat
strange
that
this
divinely
innocent
creature
he
glorifies
should
arise
straight
out
of
a
which
is
shown
up
as
the
embodiment
of
hollowness
and
conventional
superficiality
if
men
can
lay
the
butter
on
thick
in
their
laudation
of
womanhood
female
idolaters
of
their
own
sex
can
fairly
outbid
them
at
the
time
of
writing
there
has
just
come
under
my
notice
a
dithyramb
in
the
journal
by
miss
winnifred
blatchford
on
the
sacrosanct
perfections
of
womanhood
in
general
especially
as
exemplified
in
the
suicidal
exploits
of
the
late
lamented
emily
wilding
davidson
of
epsom
fame
and
a
diatribe
on
the
purity
beauty
and
unapproachable
glory
of
woman
according
to
this
lady
the
glory
of
womanhood
seems
to
extend
to
every
part
of
the
female
organism
but
we
are
told
is
especially
manifested
in
the
hair
oozing
into
the
roots
apparently
evidently
there
is
something
especially
sacred
in
woman
s
hair
this
prose
ode
to
woman
as
exemplified
in
emily
davidson
culminates
in
the
invocation
will
the
day
ever
come
when
a
woman
s
life
will
be
rated
higher
than
that
of
a
jockey
poor
jockey
we
will
trust
not
though
present
appearances
do
indicate
a
strong
tendency
to
regard
a
woman
as
possessing
the
prerogatives
of
the
sacred
cow
of
indian
or
ancient
egyptian
fame
it
is
impossible
to
read
or
hear
any
discussion
on
say
the
marriage
laws
without
it
being
apparent
that
the
female
side
of
the
question
is
the
one
element
of
the
problem
which
is
considered
worthy
of
attention
the
undoubted
iniquity
of
our
existing
marriage
laws
is
always
spoken
of
as
an
injustice
to
the
woman
and
the
changes
in
the
direction
of
greater
freedom
which
are
advocated
as
a
relief
to
the
wife
bound
to
a
bad
or
otherwise
unendurable
husband
that
the
converse
case
may
happen
that
that
reviled
and
despised
thing
a
husband
may
also
have
reason
to
desire
relief
from
a
wife
whose
angelic
qualities
and
vast
superiority
to
his
own
vile
male
self
he
fails
to
appreciate
never
seems
to
enter
into
the
calculation
at
all
that
no
satisfactory
formulation
of
the
psychology
of
the
movement
of
feminism
has
yet
been
offered
is
undoubtedly
true
for
the
moment
i
take
it
all
we
can
do
is
the
fact
as
a
case
of
what
we
may
term
social
hypnotism
of
those
waves
of
feeling
uninfluenced
by
reason
which
are
a
phenomenon
so
common
in
manias
flagellant
fanaticisms
religious
revivals
and
similar
social
upheavals
the
belief
that
woman
is
oppressed
by
man
and
that
the
need
for
remedying
that
oppression
at
all
costs
is
urgent
partly
at
least
doubtless
belongs
to
this
order
of
phenomena
that
this
feeling
is
widespread
and
held
in
various
degrees
of
intensity
by
large
numbers
of
persons
men
no
less
than
women
is
not
to
be
denied
that
it
is
of
the
nature
of
a
hypnotic
wave
of
sentiment
uninfluenced
by
reason
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
argument
does
not
seem
to
touch
it
you
may
show
conclusively
that
facts
are
opposed
to
the
assumption
that
so
far
from
women
being
oppressed
the
very
contrary
is
the
case
that
the
existing
law
and
its
administration
is
in
no
essential
respect
whatever
unfavourable
to
women
but
on
the
contrary
is
as
a
whole
grossly
unfair
to
is
all
to
no
purpose
your
remonstrances
in
the
main
fall
on
deaf
ears
or
shall
we
say
they
fall
off
the
mind
coated
with
feminist
sentiment
as
water
falls
from
the
proverbial
duck
s
back
the
facts
are
ignored
and
the
sentiment
prevails
the
same
old
catchwords
the
same
lies
and
threadbare
fallacies
are
repeated
the
fact
that
they
have
been
shown
to
be
false
counts
for
nothing
the
hypnotic
wave
of
sentiment
sweeps
reason
aside
and
compels
men
to
believe
that
woman
is
oppressed
and
man
the
oppressor
and
believe
it
they
will
if
facts
are
against
the
of
the
hypnotic
suggestion
so
much
the
worse
for
the
facts
thus
far
the
feminist
dogma
of
the
oppression
of
the
female
sex
as
regards
the
obverse
side
of
this
sentimental
feminism
which
issues
in
ferocious
directed
against
men
for
offences
against
enacting
barbarous
tortures
such
as
the
cat
and
which
are
ordered
with
gusto
in
all
their
severity
in
our
criminal
probably
is
largely
traceable
to
the
influence
of
sadic
lusts
an
agitation
such
as
that
which
led
to
the
passing
of
the
white
slave
traffic
act
of
is
started
an
agitation
engineered
largely
by
the
inverted
libidinousness
of
social
purity
mongers
and
on
the
crest
of
this
agitation
the
votaries
of
sadic
cruelty
have
their
innings
the
foolish
sentimental
feminist
at
large
whose
indignation
against
wicked
man
is
fanned
to
fury
by
bogus
tales
and
his
judgment
captured
by
representations
of
the
severities
requisite
to
stamp
out
the
evil
he
is
assured
is
so
widespread
lends
his
fatuous
support
to
the
measures
proposed
the
judicial
bench
is
of
course
delighted
at
the
increase
of
power
given
it
over
the
prisoner
in
the
dock
and
should
any
of
the
happen
to
have
sadic
proclivities
they
are
as
happy
as
horses
in
clover
and
the
cat
flourishes
like
a
green
bay
tree
let
us
now
turn
to
the
question
of
the
psychology
of
political
feminism
political
feminism
as
regards
its
immediate
demand
of
female
suffrage
is
based
directly
on
the
modern
conception
of
democracy
this
is
its
avowed
basis
with
modern
notions
of
universal
suffrage
it
is
declared
that
the
exclusion
of
women
from
the
franchise
is
logically
incompatible
if
you
include
in
the
parliamentary
voting
lists
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
men
it
is
said
it
is
plainly
a
violation
of
the
principle
of
democracy
to
exclude
more
than
one
half
of
the
adult
population
from
the
polls
as
mill
used
to
say
in
his
advocacy
of
female
suffrage
so
long
as
the
franchise
was
restricted
to
a
very
small
section
of
the
population
there
may
have
been
nothing
noteworthy
in
the
exclusion
of
women
but
now
that
the
mass
of
men
are
entitled
to
the
vote
and
the
avowed
aim
of
democracy
is
to
extend
it
to
all
men
the
refusal
to
extend
it
still
further
to
women
is
an
anomaly
and
a
manifest
inconsistency
but
in
this
mill
and
others
who
have
used
his
argument
omitted
to
consider
one
very
vital
point
the
extensions
of
the
suffrage
such
as
have
been
demanded
and
in
part
obtained
by
democracy
up
to
the
present
agitation
have
always
referred
to
the
removal
of
class
barriers
wealth
barriers
race
barriers
a
word
social
never
to
the
removal
of
barriers
based
on
organic
barriers
determining
not
sociological
but
biological
distinctions
the
case
of
sex
is
unique
in
this
connection
and
this
fact
vitiates
any
analogy
between
the
extension
of
suffrage
to
women
and
its
extension
to
fresh
social
strata
such
as
democracy
has
hitherto
had
in
view
terminating
in
the
manhood
suffrage
which
is
the
ultimate
goal
of
all
political
democrats
now
sex
constitutes
an
organic
or
biological
difference
just
as
a
species
constitutes
another
and
of
course
a
stronger
biological
difference
hence
i
contend
the
mere
fact
of
this
difference
rules
out
the
bare
appeal
to
the
principle
of
democracy
as
an
argument
in
favour
of
the
extension
of
the
suffrage
to
women
there
is
i
submit
no
parity
between
the
principle
and
practice
of
democracy
as
hitherto
understood
and
the
new
extension
proposed
to
be
given
to
the
franchise
by
the
inclusion
of
women
within
its
pale
and
yet
there
is
no
question
but
that
the
apparent
but
delusive
demand
of
logical
consistency
in
this
question
has
influenced
and
still
influences
many
an
honest
democrat
in
his
attitude
in
this
matter
but
although
the
recognition
of
the
difference
of
sex
as
being
an
organic
difference
and
therefore
radically
other
than
social
differences
of
caste
class
wealth
or
even
race
undoubtedly
invalidates
the
appeal
to
the
democrat
on
the
ground
of
consistency
to
accept
the
principle
of
female
suffrage
yet
it
does
not
necessarily
dispose
of
the
question
it
merely
leaves
the
ground
free
for
the
problem
as
to
whether
the
organic
distinction
implied
in
sex
does
or
does
not
involve
corresponding
intellectual
and
moral
differences
in
the
female
sex
which
it
is
proposed
to
enfranchise
and
furthermore
whether
such
differences
if
they
exist
involve
general
inferiority
or
at
least
an
unfitness
for
the
exercise
of
political
functions
these
questions
we
have
i
think
sufficiently
discussed
already
in
the
present
work
the
fact
of
the
existence
of
exceptionally
able
women
in
various
departments
does
undoubtedly
mislead
many
men
in
their
judgment
as
to
the
capacity
of
the
average
woman
to
think
politically
or
otherwise
to
show
herself
the
effective
equal
of
the
average
man
morally
and
intellectually
the
reasons
for
answering
this
question
in
the
negative
we
have
already
briefly
indicated
in
the
course
of
our
investigations
this
renders
it
unnecessary
to
discuss
the
matter
any
further
here
in
dealing
with
the
psychological
aspects
of
the
feminist
movement
the
intellectual
conditions
which
paved
the
way
for
its
acceptance
it
is
worth
while
recalling
two
or
three
typical
instances
of
the
class
of
argument
to
be
heard
on
occasion
from
the
female
advocates
for
the
suffrage
thus
when
the
census
was
taken
in
and
the
women
s
political
and
social
union
conceived
as
they
thought
the
brilliant
idea
of
annoying
the
authorities
and
vitiating
the
results
of
the
census
by
refusing
to
allow
themselves
to
be
enrolled
one
of
the
leaders
when
interviewed
on
the
point
gave
her
reason
for
her
refusal
to
be
included
in
the
following
terms
i
am
not
a
citizen
meaning
that
she
did
not
possess
the
franchise
and
i
am
not
going
to
pretend
to
be
the
silliness
of
this
observation
is
of
course
obvious
seeing
that
the
franchise
or
even
citizenship
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
census
which
includes
infants
besides
criminals
lunatics
imbeciles
etc
again
in
a
manifesto
of
the
women
s
political
and
social
union
defending
and
other
militant
outrages
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
coal
strike
had
caused
more
injury
than
the
and
yet
the
strikers
were
not
prosecuted
as
the
other
words
the
exercise
of
the
basal
personal
right
of
the
free
man
to
withhold
his
labour
save
under
the
conditions
agreed
to
by
him
is
paralleled
with
criminal
outrage
against
person
and
property
again
some
three
or
four
years
ago
when
the
women
s
suffrage
bill
had
passed
the
commons
on
its
being
announced
by
the
government
that
for
the
remainder
of
the
session
no
further
facilities
could
be
given
for
private
members
bills
save
for
those
of
a
character
one
of
these
sapient
females
urged
in
the
press
that
seeing
that
there
were
persons
to
be
found
in
both
the
orthodox
political
camps
who
were
in
favour
of
female
suffrage
therefore
the
bill
in
question
must
be
regarded
as
of
a
character
once
more
a
lady
writing
a
few
months
ago
to
one
of
the
weekly
journals
remarked
that
though
deliberate
destruction
of
letters
and
arson
might
be
illegal
acts
yet
that
the
punishing
of
them
by
imprisonment
with
hard
labour
they
being
political
offences
was
also
an
illegal
act
with
the
conclusion
that
the
militants
and
the
authorities
both
alike
having
committed
illegal
acts
were
quits
these
choice
specimens
of
suffragettes
logic
are
given
as
throwing
a
significant
light
on
the
mental
condition
of
women
in
the
suffragette
movement
and
indirectly
on
female
psychology
generally
one
would
presumably
suppose
that
the
women
who
put
them
forward
must
have
failed
to
see
the
exhibition
they
were
making
of
themselves
that
any
human
being
out
of
an
asylum
could
have
sunk
to
the
depth
of
fatuous
inconsequent
idiocy
they
indicate
would
seem
scarcely
credible
is
the
order
of
imbecility
which
the
above
and
many
similar
utterances
reflect
confined
to
suffragette
intelligence
alone
or
does
it
point
to
radical
inferiority
of
intellectual
fibre
not
in
degree
merely
but
in
kind
in
the
mental
constitution
of
the
human
female
generally
certainly
it
is
hard
to
think
that
any
man
however
low
his
intelligence
would
be
capable
of
making
a
fool
of
himself
precisely
in
the
way
these
women
are
continually
doing
in
their
attempts
to
defend
their
cause
and
their
tactics
in
the
foregoing
pages
we
have
endeavoured
to
trace
some
of
the
leading
strands
of
thought
going
to
make
up
the
modern
feminist
movement
sentimental
feminism
clearly
has
its
roots
in
sexual
feeling
and
in
the
tradition
of
chivalry
albeit
the
notion
of
chivalry
has
essentially
changed
in
the
course
of
its
evolution
for
the
rest
sentimental
feminism
with
its
double
character
of
and
as
we
see
it
has
assumed
the
character
of
one
of
those
psychopathic
social
phenomena
which
have
so
often
recurred
in
history
it
can
only
be
explained
like
the
latter
as
an
hypnotic
wave
passing
over
society
as
for
political
feminism
we
have
shown
that
this
largely
has
its
root
in
a
fallacious
application
of
the
notion
of
democracy
partaking
largely
of
the
logical
fallacy
known
technically
as
dicto
secundum
quid
ad
dictum
this
logical
fallacy
of
political
feminism
is
of
course
reinforced
and
urged
forward
by
sentimental
feminism
as
coming
under
the
head
of
the
psychology
of
the
movement
we
have
also
called
attention
to
some
curious
phenomena
of
logical
imbecility
noticeable
in
the
utterances
of
educated
women
in
the
suffragette
agitation
chapter
viii
the
indictment
feminism
or
as
it
is
sometimes
called
the
emancipation
of
woman
as
we
know
it
in
the
present
day
may
be
justifiably
indicted
as
a
gigantic
fraud
in
its
general
aim
and
a
fraud
alike
in
its
methods
of
controversy
and
in
its
practical
tactics
it
is
through
and
through
disingenuous
and
dishonest
modern
feminism
has
always
professed
to
be
a
movement
for
political
and
social
equality
between
the
sexes
the
claim
for
this
equalising
of
position
and
rights
in
modern
society
is
logically
based
upon
the
assumption
of
an
essential
equality
in
natural
ability
between
the
sexes
as
to
this
we
have
indicated
in
the
preceding
pages
on
broad
lines
the
grounds
for
regarding
the
foregoing
assumption
as
false
but
quite
apart
from
this
question
i
contend
the
fraudulent
nature
of
the
present
movement
can
readily
be
seen
by
showing
it
to
be
not
merely
based
on
false
grounds
but
directly
and
consciously
fraudulent
in
its
pretensions
it
uniformly
professes
to
aim
at
the
placing
of
the
sexes
on
a
footing
of
social
and
political
equality
a
very
little
inquiry
into
its
concrete
demands
suffices
to
show
that
its
aim
so
far
from
being
equality
is
the
very
to
bring
about
with
the
aid
of
men
themselves
as
embodied
in
the
forces
of
the
state
a
female
ascendancy
and
a
consolidation
and
extension
of
already
existing
female
privileges
that
this
is
so
may
be
seen
in
general
by
the
constant
conjunction
of
political
and
sentimental
feminism
in
the
same
persons
it
may
be
seen
more
particularly
in
detail
in
the
specific
demands
of
feminists
these
demands
as
formulated
by
suffragists
as
a
reason
why
the
vote
is
essential
to
the
interests
of
women
amount
to
little
if
anything
else
than
proposals
for
laws
to
enslave
and
browbeat
men
and
to
admit
women
to
virtual
if
not
actual
immunity
for
all
offences
committed
against
men
it
is
enough
to
consult
any
suggestions
for
a
woman
s
charter
in
order
to
confirm
what
is
here
said
such
proposals
invariably
suggest
the
sacrificing
of
man
at
every
turn
to
woman
this
is
arrived
at
by
the
clever
trick
of
appealing
to
the
modern
theory
of
the
equal
mental
capacity
of
the
sexes
when
it
is
a
question
of
political
and
economic
rights
and
advantages
for
women
and
of
counterappealing
to
the
traditional
sentiment
based
on
the
belief
in
the
inferiority
of
the
female
sex
when
it
is
a
question
of
legal
and
administrative
privilege
and
consideration
the
feminist
thus
succeeds
by
his
dexterity
in
the
usually
difficult
feat
of
getting
it
both
ways
for
his
fair
clients
in
the
early
eighties
of
the
last
century
appeared
a
skit
in
the
form
of
a
novel
from
the
pen
of
the
late
sir
walter
besant
entitled
the
revolt
of
man
depicting
the
oppression
of
man
under
a
feminist
régime
an
oppression
which
ended
in
a
revolt
and
the
of
male
supremacy
the
ideas
underlying
this
d
of
the
subjection
of
men
would
seem
to
be
seriously
entertained
by
the
female
leaders
of
the
present
woman
s
movement
it
is
many
years
ago
now
since
a
minister
holding
one
of
the
highest
positions
in
the
present
cabinet
made
the
remark
to
me
the
real
object
you
know
for
which
these
women
want
the
vote
is
simply
to
get
rascally
laws
passed
against
men
subsequent
feminist
agitation
has
abundantly
proved
the
truth
of
this
observation
an
illustration
of
the
practical
results
of
the
modern
woman
s
movement
is
to
be
seen
in
the
infamous
white
slave
traffic
act
of
rushed
through
parliament
as
a
piece
of
panic
legislation
by
dint
of
a
campaign
of
sheer
hard
lying
the
atrocity
of
this
act
has
been
sufficiently
dealt
with
in
a
previous
chapter
there
is
one
fortunate
thing
as
regards
these
savage
laws
aimed
at
the
suppression
of
certain
crimes
and
that
is
as
it
would
seem
they
are
never
effective
in
achieving
their
purpose
as
mr
tighe
hopkins
remarks
apropos
of
the
torture
of
the
cat
wards
of
the
state
the
attempt
to
correct
crime
with
crime
has
everywhere
repaid
us
in
the
old
properly
disastrous
it
would
indeed
be
regrettable
if
it
could
be
shown
that
penal
laws
of
this
kind
were
successful
far
better
is
it
that
the
crimes
of
isolated
individuals
should
continue
than
that
crimes
such
as
the
infliction
of
torture
and
death
committed
at
the
behest
of
the
state
as
supposed
to
represent
the
whole
of
society
should
attain
their
object
even
though
the
object
be
the
suppression
of
crimes
of
another
kind
perpetrated
by
the
aforesaid
individuals
within
society
the
successful
repression
of
crimes
committed
by
individuals
by
a
crime
committed
by
state
authority
can
only
act
as
an
encouragement
to
the
state
to
continue
its
course
of
inflicting
punishment
which
is
itself
a
crime
other
results
of
the
inequality
between
the
sexes
so
effectively
urged
by
feminism
may
be
seen
in
the
conduct
of
magistrates
judges
and
juries
in
our
courts
civil
and
criminal
this
has
been
already
animadverted
upon
in
the
course
of
the
present
work
and
illustrative
cases
given
as
also
in
previous
writings
of
the
present
author
to
which
allusion
has
already
been
made
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
a
man
has
practically
no
chance
in
the
present
day
in
a
court
of
law
civil
or
criminal
of
obtaining
justice
where
a
woman
is
in
the
case
the
savage
vindictiveness
exhibited
towards
men
as
displayed
in
the
eagerness
of
judges
to
obtain
and
the
readiness
of
juries
to
return
convictions
against
men
accused
of
crimes
against
women
on
evidence
which
in
many
cases
would
not
be
good
enough
to
use
the
common
phrase
to
hang
a
dog
on
with
the
inevitable
ferocious
sentence
following
conviction
may
be
witnessed
on
almost
every
occasion
when
such
cases
are
up
for
trial
i
have
spoken
of
the
eagerness
of
judges
to
obtain
convictions
as
an
illustration
of
this
sort
of
thing
the
following
may
be
given
the
trial
of
a
man
for
the
murder
of
a
woman
before
mr
justice
bucknill
which
took
place
some
time
ago
it
came
out
in
evidence
that
the
woman
had
violently
and
obscenely
abused
and
threatened
the
man
immediately
before
in
the
presence
of
other
persons
the
jury
were
so
impressed
with
the
evidence
of
unusually
strong
provocation
that
they
hesitated
whether
it
was
not
sufficient
to
reduce
the
crime
to
that
of
manslaughter
and
unable
to
agree
offhand
on
a
verdict
of
murder
asked
the
judge
for
further
guidance
their
deliberations
were
however
cut
short
by
the
judge
who
remarked
on
the
hesitation
they
had
in
arriving
at
their
verdict
finally
adding
only
think
gentlemen
how
you
would
view
it
had
this
been
your
own
wife
or
sister
who
was
cruelly
done
to
death
with
the
habitual
obsequiousness
of
a
british
jury
towards
the
occupant
of
the
bench
the
gentlemen
in
question
swallowed
complacently
the
insult
thrown
at
their
wives
and
sisters
in
putting
them
in
the
same
category
with
a
foul
strumpet
and
promptly
did
what
the
judge
obviously
wanted
of
wit
brought
in
a
verdict
of
wilful
murder
the
cases
on
the
obverse
side
where
the
judge
by
similar
sentimental
appeal
aims
at
procuring
the
acquittal
of
female
prisoners
notoriously
guilty
on
the
evidence
that
palladium
of
rogues
the
english
law
of
libel
precludes
me
from
referring
to
individually
as
regards
the
disparity
in
punishment
however
we
have
an
apt
and
recent
illustration
in
the
execution
of
the
youth
of
nineteen
convicted
on
doubtful
evidence
of
the
murder
of
his
sweetheart
and
the
reprieve
of
the
woman
convicted
on
her
own
admission
of
the
murder
of
her
paramour
by
soaking
him
in
paraffin
during
his
sleep
and
setting
him
alight
another
effect
of
the
influence
of
sentimental
feminism
is
seen
in
crimes
of
the
unwritten
law
description
the
of
the
french
the
most
atrocious
and
dastardly
murders
and
other
crimes
of
violence
are
condoned
and
even
glorified
if
they
can
but
be
covered
by
the
excuse
that
they
are
dictated
by
a
desire
to
avenge
a
woman
s
honour
or
to
enable
her
to
obtain
the
object
of
her
wishes
the
incident
in
sir
barrie
s
play
of
the
lady
who
murders
a
man
by
throwing
him
out
of
a
railway
carriage
over
a
dispute
respecting
the
opening
of
a
window
and
gets
acquitted
on
the
excuse
that
her
little
girl
had
got
a
cold
represents
a
not
exaggerated
picture
of
modern
justice
women
only
the
outrageous
application
of
the
principles
if
such
you
may
call
them
of
sentimental
feminism
in
this
country
in
the
case
of
the
suffragettes
has
made
english
justice
and
penal
administration
the
of
the
world
but
the
way
in
which
the
crimes
of
the
suffragettes
have
been
dealt
with
is
after
all
only
a
slight
exaggeration
of
the
immunity
from
all
the
severer
penalties
of
the
law
enjoyed
by
female
convicts
generally
this
has
been
carried
in
the
case
of
suffragette
criminals
to
the
utmost
limits
of
absurdity
in
fact
the
deference
exhibited
towards
these
deliberate
perpetrators
of
crimes
of
wanton
destruction
is
sometimes
comic
as
in
the
case
of
the
richmond
magistrate
who
rebuked
the
in
an
arson
charge
for
omitting
the
miss
in
referring
to
one
of
the
female
prisoners
in
the
dock
as
well
as
in
the
high
character
usually
attributed
to
the
perpetrators
of
these
deeds
of
outrage
and
violence
even
by
certain
functionaries
of
church
and
state
they
did
not
speak
in
this
strain
morebetoken
when
mere
male
anarchists
or
fenians
were
involved
in
difficulties
with
the
law
due
to
overzeal
for
their
cause
the
whole
movement
it
is
quite
evident
depends
for
its
success
largely
at
least
on
the
apathy
of
men
the
bulk
of
men
undoubtedly
do
not
sympathise
with
the
pretensions
of
the
feminist
agitation
but
the
bulk
of
men
are
indifferent
one
way
or
the
other
they
do
not
take
the
feminist
movement
seriously
the
bare
notion
of
women
as
such
being
a
danger
to
men
as
such
strikes
them
as
absurd
they
do
not
realise
that
the
question
is
not
of
the
physical
strength
of
women
as
women
but
of
the
whole
forces
of
the
state
being
at
the
disposal
of
women
to
set
in
motion
to
gratify
their
whims
and
passions
the
idea
of
a
sex
war
in
which
women
take
the
field
against
men
such
as
represents
the
inwardness
of
the
whole
feminist
movement
of
seems
to
them
ridiculous
the
feeling
at
the
root
of
most
men
s
patronage
of
or
indifference
to
modern
feminist
claims
is
roughly
expressed
in
a
remark
of
the
late
william
morris
in
replying
to
some
animadversions
of
mine
on
the
subject
what
does
it
matter
a
man
ought
to
be
always
able
to
deal
with
a
woman
if
necessary
why
i
could
tackle
a
half
dozen
women
at
once
for
that
matter
this
is
a
common
attitude
of
mind
on
the
subject
among
otherwise
sane
and
sensible
men
the
absurdity
of
it
is
manifest
when
one
considers
that
the
issue
of
man
versus
woman
as
units
of
physical
strength
respectively
is
purely
irrelevant
it
is
not
a
question
of
the
man
tackling
the
woman
or
any
number
of
women
it
is
the
question
of
the
whole
force
of
the
state
tackling
the
man
of
the
woman
the
prevalent
idea
in
many
men
s
minds
seems
to
be
that
of
the
state
drawing
a
around
the
disputant
man
and
woman
and
letting
them
fight
the
matter
out
between
themselves
which
to
speak
the
language
of
the
great
geometer
of
is
modern
feminism
tacking
itself
on
to
an
older
tradition
which
it
travesties
beyond
all
recognition
has
succeeded
in
affecting
modern
public
opinion
with
an
overpowering
sense
of
the
sacrosanctity
of
human
femality
as
such
it
is
not
content
with
respect
for
the
ideal
of
womanhood
but
it
would
fain
place
on
a
pedestal
the
mere
fact
of
femalehood
in
itself
this
is
illustrated
in
a
thousand
ways
thus
while
public
opinion
tolerates
the
most
bestial
and
infamous
forms
of
corporal
punishment
for
men
in
gaols
it
will
regard
the
slight
chastisement
by
the
medical
head
of
an
institution
for
mental
cases
of
a
girl
who
is
admittedly
obstinate
and
refractory
rather
than
mentally
afflicted
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
term
as
again
in
order
to
sustain
its
favourite
thesis
the
intellectual
equality
of
woman
with
man
it
resorts
whenever
a
plausible
case
presents
itself
to
its
usual
policy
of
the
falsification
of
fact
take
the
instance
of
madame
curie
when
radium
was
first
discovered
in
the
laboratory
of
the
late
professor
curie
we
were
told
that
the
latter
had
made
the
discovery
it
being
at
the
same
time
mentioned
that
he
possessed
in
his
wife
a
valuable
aid
in
his
laboratory
work
we
were
afterwards
told
that
the
discovery
of
radium
was
the
joint
work
of
both
the
implication
being
that
the
honours
were
equally
divided
now
feminist
influence
has
succeeded
in
getting
madame
curie
spoken
of
as
herself
the
discoverer
of
radium
i
venture
to
affirm
that
there
is
no
evidence
whatever
for
assuming
that
radium
would
ever
have
seen
the
light
had
the
late
professor
curie
not
himself
experimented
in
his
laboratory
not
to
speak
of
his
predecessor
becquerel
we
have
seen
that
feminists
are
in
this
country
at
least
zealous
in
championing
the
puritan
view
of
sexual
morality
many
of
them
in
the
vehemence
of
their
crusade
look
forward
with
relish
to
the
opportunity
they
anticipate
will
be
afforded
them
when
women
get
the
vote
of
passing
laws
rigorously
enforcing
asceticism
on
men
by
means
of
severe
penal
enactments
all
forms
of
indulgence
by
men
sexual
or
otherwise
uncongenial
to
the
puritanic
mind
would
be
equally
placed
under
the
ban
of
the
criminal
law
anyone
desirous
of
testing
the
truth
of
the
above
statement
has
only
to
read
the
suffragette
papers
and
other
expositions
of
the
gospel
of
feminism
as
held
by
its
most
devoted
advocates
one
point
should
not
be
lost
sight
of
and
that
is
the
attitude
of
the
press
almost
all
journals
are
ready
to
publish
any
argument
in
favour
of
the
suffrage
or
of
the
other
claims
of
the
movement
on
behalf
of
women
in
defiance
of
this
fact
a
prominent
feminist
prelate
some
time
ago
in
a
letter
to
alleged
among
the
other
grievances
of
women
at
the
present
day
and
apparently
as
in
some
sort
a
condonation
of
militancy
that
the
press
was
closed
to
women
anxious
to
air
their
grievances
a
statement
more
directly
the
reverse
of
the
truth
could
hardly
have
been
made
open
any
paper
of
general
any
of
the
morning
you
will
find
letters
galore
advocating
the
feminist
side
of
the
question
according
to
my
own
observation
they
are
in
the
proportion
of
something
like
three
or
four
in
favour
to
one
against
the
fact
is
useless
denying
that
this
has
every
favour
shown
it
by
current
public
opinion
including
even
that
of
its
opponents
female
militants
of
the
suffrage
have
pleas
urged
in
condonation
of
their
criminal
acts
such
as
their
alleged
high
character
which
would
be
laughed
at
in
the
case
of
yet
they
whine
at
being
boycotted
the
readiness
and
almost
eagerness
with
which
certain
sections
of
british
public
opinion
are
ready
to
view
favourably
anything
urged
on
behalf
of
female
suffrage
is
aptly
illustrated
by
the
argument
we
so
often
hear
when
the
existence
of
militancy
is
pointed
out
as
a
reason
for
withholding
the
argument
namely
as
to
the
unfairness
of
refusing
the
franchise
to
numbers
of
peaceable
and
women
who
are
asking
for
it
because
a
relatively
small
section
of
women
resort
to
criminal
methods
of
emphasising
their
demand
now
let
us
examine
the
real
interpretation
of
the
facts
it
is
quite
true
that
the
majority
of
the
women
agitating
for
the
suffrage
at
the
present
day
are
themselves
but
what
is
and
has
been
their
attitude
towards
their
militant
sisters
have
they
ever
repudiated
the
criminal
tactics
of
the
latter
with
the
decision
and
even
indignation
one
might
reasonably
have
expected
had
they
really
regarded
the
campaign
of
violence
and
wanton
outrage
with
strong
disapprobation
not
to
say
abhorrence
the
answer
must
be
a
decided
negative
at
the
very
most
they
mildly
rebuke
the
unwisdom
of
militant
methods
blessing
them
as
it
were
with
faint
blame
while
as
a
general
rule
they
will
not
go
even
so
far
as
this
but
are
content
while
graciously
deigning
to
tell
you
that
although
their
own
methods
are
not
those
of
militancy
yet
that
they
and
the
militants
are
alike
working
for
the
same
end
notwithstanding
they
may
differ
as
to
the
most
effective
methods
of
attaining
it
the
woman
suffragist
is
always
careful
never
to
appear
an
everyone
can
see
that
had
the
bulk
of
the
peaceable
and
suffragists
to
whose
claims
we
are
enjoined
to
give
ear
honestly
and
resolutely
set
their
faces
against
and
vigorously
denounced
the
criminal
campaign
refusing
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it
or
its
authors
the
campaign
in
question
would
have
come
to
an
end
long
ago
but
no
this
would
not
have
suited
the
book
of
the
peaceable
and
advocates
of
woman
s
suffrage
their
aim
has
been
and
is
still
to
run
with
the
militant
hare
and
hunt
with
the
peaceable
and
hounds
while
themselves
abstaining
from
any
unlawful
act
they
are
perfectly
willing
and
desirous
that
they
and
their
movement
shall
reap
all
the
advantages
of
advertisement
and
otherwise
that
may
accrue
from
the
militant
policy
that
the
above
is
a
true
state
of
the
case
as
regards
the
peaceful
and
elements
in
the
suffragist
movement
which
we
are
assured
so
largely
outnumber
the
militant
section
one
would
think
must
be
plain
to
everyone
however
obtuse
who
has
followed
with
attention
the
course
of
the
present
agitation
and
yet
there
are
fools
of
the
male
sex
who
consider
seriously
this
preposterous
plea
of
the
injustice
of
refusing
to
concede
the
suffrage
to
a
large
number
of
peaceable
and
women
who
are
demanding
it
because
of
the
action
of
a
small
body
of
violent
whom
the
aforesaid
large
body
of
peaceable
and
women
while
keeping
themselves
carefully
aloof
from
active
participation
in
militancy
do
not
pretend
to
conceal
their
sympathy
the
whole
modern
woman
s
movement
is
based
in
a
measure
at
least
on
an
assumption
which
is
absolutely
wit
that
man
has
systematically
oppressed
woman
in
the
past
that
the
natural
tendency
of
man
is
always
to
oppress
woman
or
to
put
it
from
the
other
side
that
woman
is
the
victim
of
man
s
egoism
the
unsoundness
of
this
view
ought
to
be
apparent
to
every
unbiassed
student
of
history
anthropology
and
physiology
the
feminist
prefers
to
see
evidence
of
male
oppression
in
the
place
woman
has
occupied
in
social
and
political
life
rather
than
the
natural
consequence
of
her
organic
constitution
her
secondary
sexual
characteristics
and
the
natural
average
inferiority
which
flows
therefrom
as
regards
the
personal
relations
between
men
and
women
an
impartial
view
of
the
case
must
inevitably
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
whatever
else
man
in
general
may
have
on
his
conscience
no
reasonable
reproach
lies
to
his
score
as
regards
his
treatment
of
woman
the
patience
forbearance
and
kindliness
with
which
from
socrates
downwards
men
as
a
rule
have
encountered
the
whims
the
tempers
and
the
tantrums
of
their
often
unworthy
womankind
is
indeed
a
marvel
but
it
is
a
still
greater
marvel
that
modern
feminism
in
this
as
in
other
things
should
have
succeeded
in
hocussing
public
opinion
into
the
delusion
that
the
exact
opposite
of
the
truth
represents
the
real
state
of
the
case
this
however
is
a
marvel
which
runs
through
the
history
of
the
controversial
exploits
of
the
whole
feminist
movement
in
the
foregoing
pages
we
have
striven
to
unmask
the
shameless
imposture
which
in
the
main
this
movement
represents
we
have
tracked
down
one
dishonest
argument
after
another
we
have
pointed
out
how
the
thinnest
and
hollowest
of
subterfuges
are
allowed
to
pass
muster
and
even
to
become
current
coin
by
dint
of
unrefuted
reiteration
the
feminist
trick
of
reversing
the
facts
of
the
case
as
for
example
the
assertion
that
law
and
its
administration
is
unjust
to
women
and
then
raising
a
howl
of
indignation
at
the
position
of
affairs
they
picture
such
being
of
course
the
diametrical
opposite
of
the
real
this
has
been
exposed
in
conclusion
i
can
only
express
the
hope
that
honest
straightforward
men
who
have
been
bitten
by
feminist
wiles
will
take
pause
and
reconsider
their
position
whatever
sentiment
or
sympathy
they
may
have
with
the
aims
of
the
movement
intrinsically
it
ought
to
be
not
too
much
to
expect
them
to
view
with
contempt
and
abhorrence
the
mass
of
disingenuous
falsehood
and
transparent
subterfuge
which
the
votaries
of
feminism
systematically
seek
to
palm
off
upon
a
public
too
easily
gullible
in
this
true
fact

valid
argument
