the
interurban
express
company

to
mike
flannery
th

they
chinese
or
tipperary
by
birth
morehouse
hesitated
he
bit
his
lip
and
then
flung
out
his
arms
wildly
very
well
he
shouted
you
shall
hear
of
this
your
president
shall
hear
of
this
it
is
an
outrage
i
have
offered
you
fifty
cents

keep
the
pigs
until

are
ready
to
take
the
fifty
cents
but
by
george
sir
if
one
hair
of
those
pigs
heads
is
harmed
i
will
have
the
law
on
you
he
turned
and
stalked
out
slamming
the
door
flannery
carefully
lifted
the
soap
box
from
the
counter
and
placed
it
in
a
corner
he
was
not
worried
he
felt
the
peace
that
comes
to
a
faithful
servant
who
has
done
his
duty
and
done
it
well
morehouse
went
home
raging
his
boy
who
had
been
awaiting
the
knew
better
than
to
ask
him
for
them
he
was
a
normal
boy
and
therefore
always
had
a
guilty
conscience
when
his
father
was
angry
so
the
boy
slipped
quietly
around
the
house
there
is
nothing
so
soothing
to
a
guilty
conscience
as
to
be
out
of
the
path
of
the
avenger
morehouse
stormed
into
the
house
where
the
ink
he
shouted
at
his
wife
as
soon
as
his
foot
was
across
the
doorsill
morehouse
jumped
guiltily
she
never
used
ink
she
had
not
seen
the
ink
nor
moved
the
ink
nor
thought
of
the
ink
but
her
tone
convicted
her
of
the
guilt
of
having
borne
and
reared
a
boy
and
she
knew
that
whenever
her
husband
wanted
anything
in
a
loud
voice
the
boy
had
been
at
it
i
find
sammy
she
said
meekly
when
the
ink
was
found
morehouse
wrote
rapidly
and
he
read
the
completed
letter
and
smiled
a
triumphant
smile
that
will
settle
that
crazy
irishman
he
exclaimed
when
they
get
that
letter
he
will
hunt
another
job
all
right
a
week
later
morehouse
received
a
long
official
envelope
with
the
card
of
the
interurban
express
company
in
the
upper
left
corner
he
tore
it
open
eagerly
and
drew
out
a
sheet
of
paper
at
the
top
it
bore
the
number
the
letter
was
short
subject
rate
on
it
said

and
westcote
addressed
to
the
president
of
this
company
all
claims
for
overcharge
should
be
addressed
to
the
claims
morehouse
wrote
to
the
claims
department
he
wrote
six
pages
of
choice
sarcasm
vituperation
and
argument
and
sent
them
to
the
claims
department
a
few
weeks
later
he
received
a
reply
from
the
claims
department
attached
to
it
was
his
last
letter

against
this
company
and
your
letter
regarding
the
proper
rate
on
the
consignment
should
be
addressed
to
our
tariff
morehouse
wrote
to
the
tariff
department
he
stated
his
case
clearly
and
gave
his
arguments
in
full
quoting
a
page
or
two
from
the
encyclopedia
to
prove
that
were
not
common
pigs
with
the
care
that
characterizes
corporations
when
they
are
systematically
conducted
morehouse
letter

numbered
and
started
through
the
regular
channels
duplicate

of
the

and
several
other

and
they
were
passed
to
the
head
of
the
tariff
department
the
head
of
the
tariff

put
his

to
me
morgan
the
head
of
the
tariff
department
consulted
the
president
of
the
interurban
express
company
regarding
as
to
whether
they
were
pigs
or
not
pigs
the
president
was
inclined
to
treat
the
matter
lightly
what
is
the
rate
on
pigs
and
on
pets
he
asked
pigs
thirty
cents
pets
said
morgan
then
of
course
are
pigs
said
the
president
yes
agreed
morgan
i
look
at
it
that
way
too
a
thing
that
can
come
under
two
rates
is
naturally
due
to
be
classed
as
the
higher
but
are
pigs
are
they
rabbits
come
to
think
of
it
said
the
president
i
believe
they
are
more
like
rabbits
sort
of
station
between
pig
and
rabbit
i
think
the
question
is
this
are
of
the
domestic
pig
family
i
ask
professor
gordon
he
is
authority
on
such
things
leave
the
papers
with
the
president
put
the
papers
on
his
desk
and
wrote
a
letter
to
professor
gordon
unfortunately
the
professor
was
in
south
america
collecting
zoological
specimens
and
the
letter
was
forwarded
to
him
by
his
wife
as
the
professor
was
in
the
highest
andes
where
no
white
man
had
ever
penetrated
the
letter
was
many
months
in
reaching
him
the
president
forgot
the
morgan
forgot
them
morehouse
forgot
them
but
flannery
did
not
of
his
time
he
gave
to
the
duties
of
his
agency
the
other
half
was
devoted
to
the
long
before
professor
gordon
received
the
president
letter
morgan
received
one
from
flannery
about
them
dago
pigs
it
said
what
shall
i
do
they
are
great
in
family
life
no
race
suicide
for
them
there
are
now
shall
i
sell
them
do
you
take
this
express
office
for
a
menagerie
answer
morgan
reached
for
a
telegraph
blank
and
wrote
agent
westcote
do
sell
he
then
wrote
flannery
a
letter
calling
his
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
pigs
were
not
the
property
of
the
company
but
were
merely
being
held
during
a
settlement
of
a
dispute
regarding
rates
he
advised
flannery
to
take
the
best
possible
care
of
them
flannery
letter
in
hand
looked
at
the
pigs
and
sighed
the
box
cage
had
become
too
small
he
boarded
up
twenty
feet
of
the
rear
of
the
express
office
to
make
a
large
and
airy
home
for
them
and
went
about
his
business
he
worked
with
feverish
intensity
when
out
on
his
rounds
for
the
pigs
required
attention
and
took
most
of
his
time
some
months
later
in
desperation
he
seized
a
sheet
of
paper
and
wrote
across
it
and
mailed
it
to
morgan
morgan
returned
it
asking
for
explanation
flannery
replied
there
be
now
one
hundred
sixty
of
them
dago
pigs
for
heavens
sake
let
me
sell
off
some
do
you
want
me
to
go
crazy
sell
no
pigs
morgan
wired
not
long
after
this
the
president
of
the
express
company
received
a
letter
from
professor
gordon
it
was
a
long
and
scholarly
letter
but
the
point
was
that
the
was
the
cava
aparoea
while
the
common
pig
was
the
genius
sus
of
the
family
suidae
he
remarked
that
they
were
prolific
and
multiplied
rapidly
they
are
not
pigs
said
the
president
decidedly
to
morgan
the
cent
rate
morgan
made
the
proper
notation
on
the
papers
that
had
accumulated
in
file
and
turned
them
over
to
the
audit
department
the
audit
department
took
some
time
to
look
the
matter
up
and
after
the
usual
delay
wrote
flannery
that
as
he
had
on
hand
one
hundred
and
sixty
the
property
of
consignee
he
should
deliver
them
and
collect
charges
at
the
rate
of
cents
each
flannery
spent
a
day
herding
his
charges
through
a
narrow
opening
in
their
cage
so
that
he
might
count
them
audit
he
wrote
when
he
had
finished
the
count
you
are
way
off
there
may
be
was
one
hundred
and
sixty
dago
pigs
once
but
wake
up
be
a
back
number
i
got
even
eight
hundred
now
shall
i
collect
for
eight
hundred
or
what
how
about
dollars
i
paid
out
for
it
required
a
great
many
letters
back
and
forth
before
the
audit
department
was
able
to
understand
why
the
error
had
been
made
of
billing
one
hundred
and
sixty
instead
of
eight
hundred
and
still
more
time
for
it
to
get
the
meaning
of
the
flannery
was
crowded
into
a
few
feet
at
the
extreme
front
of
the
office
the
pigs
had
all
the
rest
of
the
room
and
two
boys
were
employed
constantly
attending
to
them
the
day
after
flannery
had
counted
the
there
were
eight
more
added
to
his
drove
and
by
the
time
the
audit
department
gave
him
authority
to
collect
for
eight
hundred
flannery
had
given
up
all
attempts
to
attend
to
the
receipt
or
the
delivery
of
goods
he
was
hastily
building
galleries
around
the
express
office
tier
above
tier
he
had
four
thousand
and
to
care
for
more
were
arriving
daily
immediately
following
its
authorization
the
audit
department
sent
another
letter
but
flannery
was
too
busy
to
open
it
they
wrote
another
and
then
they
telegraphed
error
in
bill
collect
for
two
fifty
cents
deliver
all
to
flannery
read
the
telegram
and
cheered
up
he
wrote
out
a
bill
as
rapidly
as
his
pencil
could
travel
over
paper
and
ran
all
the
way
to
the
morehouse
home
at
the
gate
he
stopped
suddenly
the
house
stared
at
him
with
vacant
eyes
the
windows
were
bare
of
curtains
and
he
could
see
into
the
empty
rooms
a
sign
on
