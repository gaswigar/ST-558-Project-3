the
hill
of
dreams
by
arthur
machen
i
there
was
a
glow
in
the
sky
as
if
great
furnace
doors
were
opened
but
all
the
afternoon
his
eyes
had
looked
on
glamour
he
had
strayed
in
fairyland
the
holidays
were
nearly
done
and
lucian
taylor
had
gone
out
resolved
to
lose
himself
to
discover
strange
hills
and
prospects
that
he
had
never
seen
before
the
air
was
still
breathless
exhausted
after
heavy
rain
and
the
clouds
looked
as
if
they
had
been
molded
of
lead
no
breeze
blew
upon
the
hill
and
down
in
the
well
of
the
valley
not
a
dry
leaf
stirred
not
a
bough
shook
in
all
the
dark
january
woods
about
a
mile
from
the
rectory
he
had
diverged
from
the
main
road
by
an
opening
that
promised
mystery
and
adventure
it
was
an
old
neglected
lane
little
more
than
a
ditch
worn
ten
feet
deep
by
its
winter
waters
and
shadowed
by
great
untrimmed
hedges
densely
woven
together
on
each
side
were
turbid
streams
and
here
and
there
a
torrent
of
water
gushed
down
the
banks
flooding
the
lane
it
was
so
deep
and
dark
that
he
could
not
get
a
glimpse
of
the
country
through
which
he
was
passing
but
the
way
went
down
and
down
to
some
unconjectured
hollow
perhaps
he
walked
two
miles
between
the
high
walls
of
the
lane
before
its
descent
ceased
but
he
thrilled
with
the
sense
of
having
journeyed
very
far
all
the
long
way
from
the
know
to
the
unknown
he
had
come
as
it
were
into
the
bottom
of
a
bowl
amongst
the
hills
and
black
woods
shut
out
the
world
from
the
road
behind
him
from
the
road
before
him
from
the
unseen
wells
beneath
the
trees
rivulets
of
waters
swelled
and
streamed
down
towards
the
center
to
the
brook
that
crossed
the
lane
amid
the
dead
and
wearied
silence
of
the
air
beneath
leaden
and
motionless
clouds
it
was
strange
to
hear
such
a
tumult
of
gurgling
and
rushing
water
and
he
stood
for
a
while
on
the
quivering
footbridge
and
watched
the
rush
of
dead
wood
and
torn
branches
and
wisps
of
straw
all
hurrying
madly
past
him
to
plunge
into
the
heaped
spume
the
barmy
froth
that
had
gathered
against
a
fallen
tree
then
he
climbed
again
and
went
up
between
limestone
rocks
higher
and
higher
till
the
noise
of
waters
became
indistinct
a
faint
humming
of
swarming
hives
in
summer
he
walked
some
distance
on
level
ground
till
there
was
a
break
in
the
banks
and
a
stile
on
which
he
could
lean
and
look
out
he
found
himself
as
he
had
hoped
afar
and
forlorn
he
had
strayed
into
outland
and
occult
territory
from
the
eminence
of
the
lane
skirting
the
brow
of
a
hill
he
looked
down
into
deep
valleys
and
dingles
and
beyond
across
the
trees
to
remoter
country
wild
bare
hills
and
dark
wooded
lands
meeting
the
grey
still
sky
immediately
beneath
his
feet
the
ground
sloped
steep
down
to
the
valley
a
hillside
of
close
grass
patched
with
dead
bracken
and
dotted
here
and
there
with
stunted
thorns
and
below
there
were
deep
oak
woods
all
still
and
silent
and
lonely
as
if
no
one
ever
passed
that
way
the
grass
and
bracken
and
thorns
and
woods
all
were
brown
and
grey
beneath
the
leaden
sky
and
as
lucian
looked
he
was
amazed
as
though
he
were
reading
a
wonderful
story
the
meaning
of
which
was
a
little
greater
than
his
understanding
then
like
the
hero
of
a
he
went
on
and
on
catching
now
and
again
glimpses
of
the
amazing
country
into
which
he
had
penetrated
and
perceiving
rather
than
seeing
that
as
the
day
waned
everything
grew
more
grey
and
somber
as
he
advanced
he
heard
the
evening
sounds
of
the
farms
the
low
of
the
cattle
and
the
barking
of
the
sheepdogs
a
faint
thin
noise
from
far
away
it
was
growing
late
and
as
the
shadows
blackened
he
walked
faster
till
once
more
the
lane
began
to
descend
there
was
a
sharp
turn
and
he
found
himself
with
a
good
deal
of
relief
and
a
little
disappointment
on
familiar
ground
he
had
nearly
described
a
circle
and
knew
this
end
of
the
lane
very
well
it
was
not
much
more
than
a
mile
from
home
he
walked
smartly
down
the
hill
the
air
was
all
glimmering
and
indistinct
transmuting
trees
and
hedges
into
ghostly
shapes
and
the
walls
of
the
white
house
farm
flickered
on
the
hillside
as
if
they
were
moving
towards
him
then
a
change
came
first
a
little
breath
of
wind
brushed
with
a
dry
whispering
sound
through
the
hedges
the
few
leaves
left
on
the
boughs
began
to
stir
and
one
or
two
danced
madly
and
as
the
wind
freshened
and
came
up
from
a
new
quarter
the
sapless
branches
above
rattled
against
one
another
like
bones
the
growing
breeze
seemed
to
clear
the
air
and
lighten
it
he
was
passing
the
stile
where
a
path
led
to
old
gibbon
desolate
little
cottage
in
the
middle
of
the
fields
at
some
distance
even
from
the
lane
and
he
saw
the
light
blue
smoke
of
her
chimney
rise
distinct
above
the
gaunt
greengage
trees
against
a
pale
band
that
was
broadening
along
the
horizon
as
he
passed
the
stile
with
his
head
bent
and
his
eyes
on
the
ground
something
white
started
out
from
the
black
shadow
of
the
hedge
and
in
the
strange
twilight
now
tinged
with
a
flush
from
the
west
a
figure
seemed
to
swim
past
him
and
disappear
for
a
moment
he
wondered
who
it
could
be
the
light
was
so
flickering
and
unsteady
so
unlike
the
real
atmosphere
of
the
day
when
he
recollected
it
was
only
annie
morgan
old
morgan
daughter
at
the
white
house
she
was
three
years
older
than
he
and
it
annoyed
him
to
find
that
though
she
was
only
fifteen
there
had
been
a
dreadful
increase
in
her
height
since
the
summer
holidays
he
had
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
hill
and
lifting
up
his
eyes
saw
the
strange
changes
of
the
sky
the
pale
band
had
broadened
into
a
clear
vast
space
of
light
and
above
the
heavy
leaden
clouds
were
breaking
apart
and
driving
across
the
heaven
before
the
wind
he
stopped
to
watch
and
looked
up
at
the
great
mound
that
jutted
out
from
the
hills
into
it
was
a
natural
formation
and
always
it
must
have
had
something
of
the
form
of
a
fort
but
its
steepness
had
been
increased
by
roman
art
and
there
were
high
banks
on
the
summit
which
lucian
father
had
told
him
were
the
of
the
camp
and
a
deep
ditch
had
been
dug
to
the
north
to
sever
it
from
the
hillside
on
this
summit
oaks
had
grown
queer
trees
with
twisted
and
contorted
trunks
and
writhing
branches
and
these
now
stood
out
black
against
the
lighted
sky
and
then
the
air
changed
once
more
the
flush
increased
and
a
spot
like
blood
appeared
in
the
pond
by
the
gate
and
all
the
clouds
were
touched
with
fiery
spots
and
dapples
of
flame
here
and
there
it
looked
as
if
awful
furnace
doors
were
being
opened
the
wind
blew
wildly
and
it
came
up
through
the
woods
with
a
noise
like
a
scream
and
a
great
oak
by
the
roadside
ground
its
boughs
together
with
a
dismal
grating
jar
as
the
red
gained
in
the
sky
the
earth
and
all
upon
it
glowed
even
the
grey
winter
fields
and
the
bare
hillsides
crimsoned
the
waterpools
were
cisterns
of
molten
brass
and
the
very
road
glittered
he
was
almost
aghast
before
the
scarlet
magic
of
the
afterglow
the
old
roman
fort
was
invested
with
fire
flames
from
heaven
were
smitten
about
its
walls
and
above
there
was
a
dark
floating
cloud
like
fume
of
smoke
and
every
haggard
writhing
tree
showed
as
black
as
midnight
against
the
black
of
the
furnace
when
he
got
home
he
heard
his
mother
voice
calling
here
lucian
at
last
mary
master
lucian
has
come
you
can
get
the
tea
ready
he
told
a
long
tale
of
his
adventures
and
felt
somewhat
mortified
when
his
father
seemed
perfectly
acquainted
with
the
whole
course
of
the
lane
and
knew
the
names
of
the
wild
woods
through
which
he
had
passed
in
awe
you
must
have
gone
by
the
darren
i
suppose
that
was
all
he
said
yes
i
noticed
the
sunset
we
shall
have
some
stormy
weather
i
expect
to
see
many
in
church
tomorrow
there
was
buttered
toast
for
tea
because
it
was
holidays
the
red
curtains
were
drawn
and
a
bright
fire
was
burning
and
there
was
the
old
familiar
furniture
a
little
shabby
but
charming
from
association
it
was
much
pleasanter
than
the
cold
and
squalid
schoolroom
and
much
better
to
be
reading
than
learning
euclid
and
better
to
talk
to
his
father
and
mother
than
to
be
answering
such
remarks
as
i
say
taylor
i
torn
my
trousers
how
much
do
you
charge
for
mending
lucy
dear
come
quick
and
sew
this
button
on
my
shirt
that
night
the
storm
woke
him
and
he
groped
with
his
hands
amongst
the
bedclothes
and
sat
up
shuddering
not
knowing
where
he
was
he
had
seen
himself
in
a
dream
within
the
roman
fort
working
some
dark
horror
and
the
furnace
doors
were
opened
and
a
blast
of
flame
from
heaven
was
smitten
upon
him
lucian
went
slowly
but
not
discreditably
up
the
school
gaining
prizes
now
and
again
and
falling
in
love
more
and
more
with
useless
reading
and
unlikely
knowledge
he
did
his
elegiacs
and
iambics
well
enough
but
he
preferred
exercising
himself
in
the
rhymed
latin
of
the
middle
ages
he
liked
history
but
he
loved
to
meditate
on
a
land
laid
waste
britain
deserted
by
the
legions
the
rare
pavements
riven
by
frost
celtic
magic
still
brooding
on
the
wild
hills
and
in
the
black
depths
of
the
forest
the
rosy
marbles
stained
with
rain
and
the
walls
growing
grey
the
masters
did
not
encourage
these
researches
a
pure
enthusiasm
they
felt
should
be
for
cricket
and
football
the
might
even
play
fives
and
read
shakespeare
without
blame
but
healthy
english
boys
should
have
nothing
to
do
with
decadent
periods
he
was
once
found
guilty
of
recommending
villon
to
a
named
barnes
barnes
tried
to
extract
unpleasantness
from
the
text
during
preparation
and
rioted
in
his
place
owing
to
his
incapacity
for
the
language
the
matter
was
a
serious
one
the
headmaster
had
never
heard
of
villon
and
the
culprit
gave
up
the
name
of
his
literary
admirer
without
remorse
hence
sorrow
for
lucian
and
complete
immunity
for
the
miserable
illiterate
barnes
who
resolved
to
confine
his
researches
to
the
old
testament
a
book
which
the
headmaster
knew
well
as
for
lucian
he
plodded
on
learning
his
work
decently
and
sometimes
doing
very
creditable
latin
and
greek
prose
his
thought
him
quite
mad
and
tolerated
him
and
indeed
were
very
kind
to
him
in
their
barbarous
manner
he
often
remembered
in
after
life
acts
of
generosity
and
good
nature
done
by
wretches
like
barnes
who
had
no
care
for
old
french
nor
for
curious
meters
and
such
recollections
always
moved
him
to
emotion
travelers
tell
such
tales
cast
upon
cruel
shores
amongst
savage
races
they
have
found
no
little
kindness
and
warmth
of
hospitality
he
looked
forward
to
the
holidays
as
joyfully
as
the
rest
of
them
barnes
and
his
friend
duscot
used
to
tell
him
their
plans
and
anticipation
they
were
going
home
to
brothers
and
sisters
and
to
cricket
more
cricket
or
to
football
more
football
and
in
the
winter
there
were
parties
and
jollities
of
all
sorts
in
return
he
would
announce
his
intention
of
studying
the
hebrew
language
or
perhaps
provençal
with
a
walk
up
a
bare
and
desolate
mountain
by
way
of
amusement
and
on
a
rainy
day
for
choice
whereupon
barnes
would
impart
to
duscot
his
confident
belief
that
old
taylor
was
quite
cracked
it
was
a
queer
funny
life
that
of
school
and
so
very
unlike
anything
in
he
once
saw
the
headmaster
patting
the
head
of
the
bishop
little
boy
while
he
called
him
my
little
man
and
smiled
hideously
he
told
the
tale
grotesquely
in
the
lower
fifth
room
the
same
day
and
earned
much
applause
but
forfeited
all
liking
directly
by
proposing
a
voluntary
course
of
scholastic
logic
one
barbarian
threw
him
to
the
ground
and
another
jumped
on
him
but
it
was
done
very
pleasantly
there
were
indeed
some
few
of
a
worse
class
in
the
school
solemn
sycophants
prigs
perfected
from
tender
years
who
thought
life
already
serious
and
yet
as
the
headmaster
said
were
joyous
manly
young
fellows
some
of
these
dressed
for
dinner
at
home
and
talked
of
dances
when
they
came
back
in
january
but
this
virulent
sort
was
comparatively
infrequent
and
achieved
great
success
in
after
life
taking
his
school
days
as
a
whole
he
always
spoke
up
for
the
system
and
years
afterward
he
described
with
enthusiasm
the
strong
beer
at
a
roadside
tavern
some
way
out
of
the
town
but
he
always
maintained
that
the
taste
for
tobacco
acquired
in
early
life
was
the
great
life
was
the
great
note
of
the
english
public
school
three
years
after
lucian
discovery
of
the
narrow
lane
and
the
vision
of
the
flaming
fort
the
august
holidays
brought
him
home
at
a
time
of
great
heat
it
was
one
of
those
memorable
years
of
english
weather
when
some
provençal
spell
seems
wreathed
round
the
island
in
the
northern
sea
and
the
grasshoppers
chirp
loudly
as
the
cicadas
the
hills
smell
of
rosemary
and
white
walls
of
the
old
farmhouses
blaze
in
the
sunlight
as
if
they
stood
in
arles
or
avignon
or
famed
tarascon
by
rhone
lucian
father
was
late
at
the
station
and
consequently
lucian
bought
the
of
an
english
opium
which
he
saw
on
the
bookstall
when
his
father
did
drive
up
lucian
noticed
that
the
old
trap
had
had
a
new
coat
of
dark
paint
and
that
the
pony
looked
advanced
in
years
i
was
afraid
that
i
should
be
late
lucian
said
his
father
though
i
made
old
polly
go
like
anything
i
was
just
going
to
tell
george
to
put
her
into
the
trap
when
young
philip
harris
came
to
me
in
a
terrible
state
he
said
his
father
fell
down
of
a
sudden
like
in
the
middle
of
the
field
and
they
could
make
him
speak
and
would
i
please
to
come
and
see
him
so
i
had
to
go
though
i
could
do
anything
for
the
poor
fellow
they
had
sent
for
burrows
and
i
am
afraid
he
will
find
it
a
bad
case
of
sunstroke
the
old
people
say
they
never
remember
such
a
heat
before
the
pony
jogged
steadily
along
the
burning
turnpike
road
taking
revenge
for
the
hurrying
on
the
way
to
the
station
the
hedges
were
white
with
the
limestone
dust
and
the
vapor
of
heat
palpitated
over
the
fields
lucian
showed
his
to
his
father
and
began
to
talk
of
the
beautiful
bits
he
had
already
found
taylor
knew
the
book
well
had
read
it
many
years
before
indeed
he
was
almost
as
difficult
to
surprise
as
that
character
in
daudet
who
had
one
formula
for
all
the
chances
of
life
and
when
he
saw
the
drowned
academician
dragged
out
of
the
river
merely
observed
vu
tout
taylor
the
parson
as
his
parishioners
called
him
had
read
the
fine
books
and
loved
the
hills
and
woods
and
now
knew
no
more
of
pleasant
or
sensational
surprises
indeed
the
living
was
much
depreciated
in
value
and
his
own
private
means
were
reduced
almost
to
vanishing
point
and
under
such
circumstances
the
great
style
loses
many
of
its
finer
savors
he
was
very
fond
of
lucian
and
cheered
by
his
return
but
in
the
evening
he
would
be
a
sad
man
again
with
his
head
resting
on
one
hand
and
eyes
reproaching
sorry
fortune
nobody
called
out
here
your
master
with
master
lucian
you
can
get
tea
ready
when
the
pony
jogged
up
to
the
front
door
his
mother
had
been
dead
a
year
and
a
cousin
kept
house
she
was
a
respectable
person
called
deacon
of
middle
age
and
ordinary
standards
and
consequently
there
was
cold
mutton
on
the
table
there
was
a
cake
but
nothing
of
flour
baked
in
ovens
would
rise
at
miss
deacon
evocation
still
the
meal
was
laid
in
the
beloved
parlor
with
the
view
of
hills
and
valleys
and
climbing
woods
from
the
open
window
and
the
old
furniture
was
still
pleasant
to
see
and
the
old
books
in
the
shelves
had
many
memories
one
of
the
most
respected
of
the
armchairs
had
become
weak
in
the
castors
and
had
to
be
artfully
propped
up
but
lucian
found
it
very
comfortable
after
the
hard
forms
when
tea
was
over
he
went
out
and
strolled
in
the
garden
and
orchards
and
looked
over
the
stile
down
into
the
brake
where
foxgloves
and
bracken
and
broom
mingled
with
the
hazel
undergrowth
where
he
knew
of
secret
glades
and
untracked
recesses
deep
in
the
woven
green
the
cabinets
for
many
years
of
his
lonely
meditations
every
path
about
his
home
every
field
and
hedgerow
had
dear
and
friendly
memories
for
him
and
the
odor
of
the
meadowsweet
was
better
than
the
incense
steaming
in
the
sunshine
he
loitered
and
hung
over
the
stile
till
the
woods
began
to
turn
purple
till
the
white
mists
were
wreathing
in
the
valley
day
after
day
through
all
that
august
morning
and
evening
were
wrapped
in
haze
day
after
day
the
earth
shimmered
in
the
heat
and
the
air
was
strange
unfamiliar
as
he
wandered
in
the
lanes
and
sauntered
by
the
cool
sweet
verge
of
the
woods
he
saw
and
felt
that
nothing
was
common
or
accustomed
for
the
sunlight
transfigured
the
meadows
and
changed
all
the
form
of
the
earth
under
the
violent
provençal
sun
the
elms
and
beeches
looked
exotic
trees
and
in
the
early
morning
when
the
mists
were
thick
the
hills
had
put
on
an
unearthly
shape
the
one
adventure
of
the
holidays
was
the
visit
to
the
roman
fort
to
that
fantastic
hill
about
whose
steep
bastions
and
haggard
oaks
he
had
seen
the
flames
of
sunset
writhing
nearly
three
years
before
ever
since
that
saturday
evening
in
january
the
lonely
valley
had
been
a
desirable
place
to
him
he
had
watched
the
green
battlements
in
summer
and
winter
weather
had
seen
the
heaped
mounds
rising
dimly
amidst
the
drifting
rain
had
marked
the
violent
height
swim
up
from
the
mists
of
summer
evenings
had
watched
the
fairy
bulwarks
glimmer
and
vanish
in
hovering
april
twilight
in
the
hedge
of
the
lane
there
was
a
gate
on
which
he
used
to
lean
and
look
down
south
to
where
the
hill
surged
up
so
suddenly
its
summit
defined
on
summer
evenings
not
only
by
the
rounded
ramparts
but
by
the
ring
of
dense
green
foliage
that
marked
the
circle
of
oak
trees
higher
up
the
lane
on
the
way
he
had
come
that
saturday
afternoon
one
could
see
the
white
walls
of
morgan
farm
on
the
hillside
to
the
north
and
on
the
south
there
was
the
stile
with
the
view
of
old
gibbon
cottage
smoke
but
down
in
the
hollow
looking
over
the
gate
there
was
no
hint
of
human
work
except
those
green
and
antique
battlements
on
which
the
oaks
stood
in
circle
guarding
the
inner
wood
the
ring
of
the
fort
drew
him
with
stronger
fascination
during
that
hot
august
weather
standing
or
as
his
headmaster
would
have
said
mooning
by
the
gate
and
looking
into
that
enclosed
and
secret
valley
it
seemed
to
his
fancy
as
if
there
were
a
halo
about
the
hill
an
aureole
that
played
like
flame
around
it
one
afternoon
as
he
gazed
from
his
station
by
the
gate
the
sheer
sides
and
the
swelling
bulwarks
were
more
than
ever
things
of
enchantment
the
green
oak
ring
stood
out
against
the
sky
as
still
and
bright
as
in
a
picture
and
lucian
in
spite
of
his
respect
for
the
law
of
trespass
slid
over
the
gate
the
farmers
and
their
men
were
busy
on
the
uplands
with
the
harvest
and
the
adventure
was
irresistible
at
first
he
stole
along
by
the
brook
in
the
shadow
of
the
alders
where
the
grass
and
the
flowers
of
wet
meadows
grew
richly
but
as
he
drew
nearer
to
the
fort
and
its
height
now
rose
sheer
above
him
he
left
all
shelter
and
began
desperately
to
mount
there
was
not
a
breath
of
wind
the
sunlight
shone
down
on
the
bare
hillside
the
loud
chirp
of
the
grasshoppers
was
the
only
sound
it
was
a
steep
ascent
and
grew
steeper
as
the
valley
sank
away
he
turned
for
a
moment
and
looked
down
towards
the
stream
which
now
seemed
to
wind
remote
between
the
alders
above
the
valley
there
were
small
dark
figures
moving
in
the
cornfield
and
now
and
again
there
came
the
faint
echo
of
a
voice
singing
through
the
air
as
on
a
wire
he
was
wet
with
heat
the
sweat
streamed
off
his
face
and
he
could
feel
it
trickling
all
over
his
body
but
above
him
the
green
bastions
rose
defiant
and
the
dark
ring
of
oaks
promised
coolness
he
pressed
on
and
higher
and
at
last
began
to
crawl
up
the
on
hands
and
knees
grasping
the
turf
and
here
and
there
the
roots
that
had
burst
through
the
red
earth
and
then
he
lay
panting
with
deep
breaths
on
the
summit
within
the
fort
it
was
all
dusky
and
cool
and
hollow
it
was
as
if
one
stood
at
the
bottom
of
a
great
cup
within
the
wall
seemed
higher
than
without
and
the
ring
of
oaks
curved
up
like
a
dark
green
vault
there
were
nettles
growing
thick
and
rank
in
the
foss
they
looked
different
from
the
common
nettles
in
the
lanes
and
lucian
letting
his
hand
touch
a
leaf
by
accident
felt
the
sting
burn
like
fire
beyond
the
ditch
there
was
an
undergrowth
a
dense
thicket
of
trees
stunted
and
old
crooked
and
withered
by
the
winds
into
awkward
and
ugly
forms
beech
and
oak
and
hazel
and
ash
and
yew
twisted
and
so
shortened
and
deformed
that
each
seemed
like
the
nettle
of
no
common
kind
he
began
to
fight
his
way
through
the
ugly
growth
stumbling
and
getting
hard
knocks
from
the
rebound
of
twisted
boughs
his
foot
struck
once
or
twice
against
something
harder
than
wood
and
looking
down
he
saw
stones
white
with
the
leprosy
of
age
but
still
showing
the
work
of
the
axe
and
farther
the
roots
of
the
stunted
trees
gripped
the
relics
of
a
wall
and
a
round
heap
of
fallen
stones
nourished
rank
unknown
herbs
that
smelt
poisonous
the
earth
was
black
and
unctuous
and
bubbling
under
the
feet
left
no
track
behind
from
it
in
the
darkest
places
where
the
shadow
was
thickest
swelled
the
growth
of
an
abominable
fungus
making
the
still
air
sick
with
its
corrupt
odor
and
he
shuddered
as
he
felt
the
horrible
thing
pulped
beneath
his
feet
then
there
was
a
gleam
of
sunlight
and
as
he
thrust
the
last
boughs
apart
he
stumbled
into
the
open
space
in
the
heart
of
the
camp
it
was
a
lawn
of
sweet
close
turf
in
the
center
of
the
matted
brake
of
clean
firm
earth
from
which
no
shameful
growth
sprouted
and
near
the
middle
of
the
glade
was
a
stump
of
a
felled
left
untrimmed
by
the
woodman
lucian
thought
it
must
have
been
made
for
a
seat
a
crooked
bough
through
which
a
little
sap
still
ran
was
a
support
for
the
back
and
he
sat
down
and
rested
after
his
toil
it
was
not
really
so
comfortable
a
seat
as
one
of
the
school
forms
but
the
satisfaction
was
to
find
anything
at
all
that
would
serve
for
a
chair
he
sat
there
still
panting
after
the
climb
and
his
struggle
through
the
dank
and
thicket
and
he
felt
as
if
he
were
growing
hotter
and
hotter
the
sting
of
the
nettle
was
burning
his
hand
and
the
tingling
fire
seemed
to
spread
all
over
his
body
suddenly
he
knew
that
he
was
alone
not
merely
solitary
that
he
had
often
been
amongst
the
woods
and
deep
in
the
lanes
but
now
it
was
a
wholly
different
and
a
very
strange
sensation
he
thought
of
the
valley
winding
far
below
him
all
its
fields
by
the
brook
green
and
peaceful
and
still
without
path
or
track
then
he
had
climbed
the
abrupt
surge
of
the
hill
and
passing
the
green
and
swelling
battlements
the
ring
of
oaks
and
the
matted
thicket
had
come
to
the
central
space
and
behind
there
were
he
knew
many
desolate
fields
wild
as
common
untrodden
unvisited
he
was
utterly
alone
he
still
grew
hotter
as
he
sat
on
the
stump
and
at
last
lay
down
at
full
length
on
the
soft
grass
and
more
at
his
ease
felt
the
waves
of
heat
pass
over
his
body
and
then
he
began
to
dream
to
let
his
fancies
stray
over
delicious
things
indulging
a
virgin
mind
in
its
wanderings
the
hot
air
seemed
to
beat
upon
him
in
palpable
waves
and
the
nettle
sting
tingled
and
itched
intolerably
and
he
was
alone
upon
the
fairy
hill
within
the
great
mounds
within
the
ring
of
oaks
deep
in
the
heart
of
the
matted
thicket
slowly
and
timidly
he
began
to
untie
his
boots
fumbling
with
the
laces
and
glancing
all
the
while
on
every
side
at
the
ugly
misshapen
trees
that
hedged
the
lawn
not
a
branch
was
straight
not
one
was
free
but
all
were
interlaced
and
grew
one
about
another
and
just
above
ground
where
the
cankered
stems
joined
the
protuberant
roots
there
were
forms
that
imitated
the
human
shape
and
faces
and
twining
limbs
that
amazed
him
green
mosses
were
hair
and
tresses
were
stark
in
grey
lichen
a
twisted
root
swelled
into
a
limb
in
the
hollows
of
the
rotted
bark
he
saw
the
masks
of
men
his
eyes
were
fixed
and
fascinated
by
the
simulacra
of
the
wood
and
could
not
see
his
hands
and
so
at
last
and
suddenly
it
seemed
he
lay
in
the
sunlight
beautiful
with
his
olive
skin
dark
haired
dark
eyed
the
gleaming
bodily
vision
of
a
strayed
faun
quick
flames
now
quivered
in
the
substance
of
his
nerves
hints
of
mysteries
secrets
of
life
passed
trembling
through
his
brain
unknown
desires
stung
him
as
he
gazed
across
the
turf
and
into
the
thicket
the
sunshine
seemed
really
to
become
green
and
the
contrast
between
the
bright
glow
poured
on
the
lawn
and
the
black
shadow
of
the
brake
made
an
odd
flickering
light
in
which
all
the
grotesque
postures
of
stem
and
root
began
to
stir
the
wood
was
alive
the
turf
beneath
him
heaved
and
sank
as
with
the
deep
swell
of
the
sea
he
fell
asleep
and
lay
still
on
the
grass
in
the
midst
of
the
thicket
he
found
out
afterwards
that
he
must
have
slept
for
nearly
an
hour
the
shadows
had
changed
when
he
awoke
his
senses
came
to
him
with
a
sudden
shock
and
he
sat
up
and
stared
at
his
bare
limbs
in
stupid
amazement
he
huddled
on
his
clothes
and
laced
his
boots
wondering
what
folly
had
beset
him
then
while
he
stood
indecisive
hesitating
his
brain
a
whirl
of
puzzled
thought
his
body
trembling
his
hands
shaking
as
with
electric
heat
sudden
remembrance
possessed
him
a
flaming
blush
shone
red
on
his
cheeks
and
glowed
and
thrilled
through
his
limbs
as
he
awoke
a
brief
and
slight
breeze
had
stirred
in
a
nook
of
the
matted
boughs
and
there
was
a
glinting
that
might
have
been
the
flash
of
sudden
sunlight
across
shadow
and
the
branches
rustled
and
murmured
for
a
moment
perhaps
at
the
wind
passage
he
stretched
out
his
hands
and
cried
to
his
visitant
to
return
he
entreated
the
dark
eyes
that
had
shone
over
him
and
the
scarlet
lips
that
had
kissed
him
and
then
panic
fear
rushed
into
his
heart
and
he
ran
blindly
dashing
through
the
wood
he
climbed
the
and
looked
out
crouching
lest
anybody
should
see
him
only
the
shadows
were
changed
and
a
breath
of
cooler
air
mounted
from
the
brook
the
fields
were
still
and
peaceful
the
black
figures
moved
far
away
amidst
the
corn
and
the
faint
echo
of
the
voices
sang
thin
and
distant
on
the
evening
wind
across
the
stream
in
the
cleft
on
the
hill
opposite
to
the
fort
the
blue
wood
smoke
stole
up
a
spiral
pillar
from
the
chimney
of
old
gibbon
cottage
he
began
to
run
full
tilt
down
the
steep
surge
of
the
hill
and
never
stopped
till
he
was
over
the
gate
and
in
the
lane
again
as
he
looked
back
down
the
valley
to
the
south
and
saw
the
violent
ascent
the
green
swelling
bulwarks
and
the
dark
ring
of
oaks
the
sunlight
seemed
to
play
about
the
fort
with
an
aureole
of
flame
where
on
earth
have
you
been
all
this
time
lucian
said
his
cousin
when
he
got
home
why
you
look
quite
ill
it
is
really
madness
of
you
to
go
walking
in
such
weather
as
this
i
wonder
you
have
got
a
sunstroke
and
the
tea
must
be
nearly
cold
i
could
keep
your
father
waiting
you
know
he
muttered
something
about
being
rather
tired
and
sat
down
to
his
tea
it
was
not
cold
for
the
cozy
had
been
put
over
the
pot
but
it
was
black
and
bitter
strong
as
his
cousin
expressed
it
the
draught
was
unpalatable
but
it
did
him
good
and
the
thought
came
with
great
consolation
that
he
had
only
been
asleep
and
dreaming
queer
nightmarish
dreams
he
shook
off
all
his
fancies
with
resolution
and
thought
the
loneliness
of
the
camp
and
the
burning
sunlight
and
possibly
the
nettle
sting
which
still
tingled
most
abominably
must
have
been
the
only
factors
in
his
farrago
of
impossible
recollections
he
remembered
that
when
he
had
felt
the
sting
he
had
seized
a
nettle
with
thick
folds
of
his
handkerchief
and
having
twisted
off
a
good
length
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
to
show
his
father
taylor
was
almost
interested
when
he
came
in
from
his
evening
stroll
about
the
garden
and
saw
the
specimen
where
did
you
manage
to
come
across
that
lucian
he
said
you
been
to
caermaen
have
you
no
i
got
it
in
the
roman
fort
by
the
common
oh
the
twyn
you
must
have
been
trespassing
then
do
you
know
what
it
is
no
i
thought
it
looked
different
from
the
common
nettles
yes
it
a
roman
nettle
it
a
rare
plant
burrows
says
it
to
be
found
at
caermaen
but
i
was
never
able
to
come
across
it
i
must
add
it
to
the
of
the
parish
taylor
had
begun
to
compile
a
accompanied
by
a
but
both
stayed
on
high
shelves
dusty
and
fragmentary
he
put
the
specimen
on
his
desk
intending
to
fasten
it
in
the
book
but
the
maid
swept
it
away
dry
and
withered
in
a
day
or
two
lucian
tossed
and
cried
out
in
his
sleep
that
night
and
the
awakening
in
the
morning
was
in
a
measure
a
renewal
of
the
awakening
in
the
fort
but
the
impression
was
not
so
strong
and
in
a
plain
room
it
seemed
all
delirium
a
phantasmagoria
he
had
to
go
down
to
caermaen
in
the
afternoon
for
dixon
the
vicar
wife
had
commanded
his
presence
at
tea
dixon
though
fat
and
short
and
clean
shaven
ruddy
of
face
was
a
safe
man
with
no
extreme
views
on
anything
he
deplored
all
extreme
party
convictions
and
thought
the
great
needs
of
our
beloved
church
were
conciliation
moderation
and
above
all
amolgamation
so
he
pronounced
the
word
dixon
was
tall
imposing
splendid
well
fitted
for
the
episcopal
order
with
gifts
that
would
have
shone
at
the
palace
there
were
daughters
who
studied
german
literature
and
thought
miss
frances
ridley
havergal
wrote
poetry
but
lucian
had
no
fear
of
them
he
dreaded
the
boys
everybody
said
they
were
such
fine
manly
fellows
such
gentlemanly
boys
with
such
a
good
manner
sure
to
get
on
in
the
world
lucian
had
said
bother
in
a
very
violent
manner
when
the
gracious
invitation
was
conveyed
to
him
but
there
was
no
getting
out
of
it
miss
deacon
did
her
best
to
make
him
look
smart
his
ties
were
all
so
disgraceful
that
she
had
to
supply
the
want
with
a
narrow
ribbon
of
a
tint
and
she
brushed
him
so
long
and
so
violently
that
he
quite
understood
why
a
horse
sometimes
bites
and
sometimes
kicks
the
groom
he
set
out
between
two
and
three
in
a
gloomy
frame
of
mind
he
knew
too
well
what
spending
the
afternoon
with
honest
manly
boys
meant
he
found
the
reality
more
lurid
than
his
anticipation
the
boys
were
in
the
field
and
the
first
remark
he
heard
when
he
got
in
sight
of
the
group
was
hullo
lucian
how
much
for
the
tie
fine
tie
another
a
stranger
observed
you
bagged
it
from
the
kitten
did
you
then
they
made
up
a
game
of
cricket
and
he
was
put
in
first
he
was
in
his
second
over
so
they
all
said
and
had
to
field
for
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
arthur
dixon
who
was
about
his
own
age
forgetting
all
the
laws
of
hospitality
told
him
he
was
a
beastly
muff
when
he
missed
a
catch
rather
a
difficult
catch
he
missed
several
catches
and
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
always
panting
after
balls
which
as
edward
dixon
said
any
fool
even
a
baby
could
have
stopped
at
last
the
game
broke
up
solely
from
lucian
lack
of
skill
as
everybody
declared
edward
dixon
who
was
thirteen
and
had
a
swollen
red
face
and
a
projecting
eye
wanted
to
fight
him
for
spoiling
the
game
and
the
others
agreed
that
he
funked
the
fight
in
a
rather
dirty
manner
the
strange
boy
who
was
called
de
carti
and
was
understood
to
be
faintly
related
to
lord
de
carti
of
said
openly
that
the
fellows
at
his
place
would
stand
such
a
sneak
for
five
minutes
so
the
afternoon
passed
off
very
pleasantly
indeed
till
it
was
time
to
go
into
the
vicarage
for
weak
tea
homemade
cake
and
unripe
plums
he
got
away
at
last
as
he
went
out
at
the
gate
he
heard
de
carti
final
observation
we
like
to
dress
well
at
our
place
his
governor
must
be
beastly
poor
to
let
him
go
about
like
that
see
his
trousers
are
all
ragged
at
heel
is
old
taylor
a
gentleman
it
had
been
a
very
gentlemanly
afternoon
but
there
was
a
certain
relief
when
the
vicarage
was
far
behind
and
the
evening
smoke
of
the
little
town
once
the
glorious
capital
of
siluria
hung
over
the
ragged
roofs
and
mingled
with
the
river
mist
he
looked
down
from
the
height
of
the
road
on
the
huddled
houses
saw
the
points
of
light
start
out
suddenly
from
the
cottages
on
the
hillside
beyond
and
gazed
at
the
long
lovely
valley
fading
in
the
twilight
till
the
darkness
came
and
all
that
remained
was
the
somber
ridge
of
the
forest
the
way
was
pleasant
through
the
solemn
scented
lane
with
glimpses
of
dim
country
the
vague
mystery
of
night
overshadowing
the
woods
and
meadows
a
warm
wind
blew
gusts
of
odor
from
the
meadowsweet
by
the
brook
now
and
then
bee
and
beetle
span
homeward
through
the
air
booming
a
deep
note
as
from
a
great
organ
far
away
and
from
the
verge
of
the
wood
came
the
of
the
owls
a
wild
strange
sound
that
mingled
with
the
whirr
and
rattle
of
the
deep
in
the
bracken
the
moon
swam
up
through
the
films
of
misty
cloud
and
hung
a
golden
glorious
lantern
in
and
set
in
the
dusky
hedge
the
little
green
fires
of
the
glowworms
appeared
he
sauntered
slowly
up
the
lane
drinking
in
the
religion
of
the
scene
and
thinking
the
country
by
night
as
mystic
and
wonderful
as
a
cathedral
he
had
quite
forgotten
the
manly
young
fellows
and
their
sports
and
only
wished
as
the
land
began
to
shimmer
and
gleam
in
the
moonlight
that
he
knew
by
some
medium
of
words
or
color
how
to
represent
the
loveliness
about
his
way
had
a
pleasant
evening
lucian
said
his
father
when
he
came
in
yes
i
had
a
nice
walk
home
oh
in
the
afternoon
we
played
cricket
i
did
care
for
it
much
there
was
a
boy
named
de
carti
there
he
is
staying
with
the
dixons
dixon
whispered
to
me
when
we
were
going
in
to
tea
a
second
cousin
of
lord
de
carti
and
she
looked
quite
grave
as
if
she
were
in
church
the
parson
grinned
grimly
and
lit
his
old
pipe
baron
de
carti
was
a
dublin
attorney
he
remarked
which
his
name
was
jeremiah
his
prejudiced
called
him
the
unjust
steward
also
the
bloody
attorney
and
i
believe
that
hell
with
was
quite
a
popular
cry
about
the
time
of
the
union
taylor
was
a
man
of
very
wide
and
irregular
reading
and
a
tenacious
memory
he
often
used
to
wonder
why
he
had
not
risen
in
the
church
he
had
once
told
dixon
a
singular
and
anecdote
concerning
the
bishop
college
days
and
he
never
discovered
why
the
prelate
did
not
bow
according
to
his
custom
when
the
name
of
taylor
was
called
at
the
next
visitation
some
people
said
the
reason
was
lighted
candles
but
that
was
impossible
as
the
reverend
and
honorable
smallwood
stafford
lord
beamys
son
who
had
a
cure
of
souls
in
the
cathedral
city
was
well
known
to
burn
no
end
of
candles
and
with
him
the
bishop
was
on
the
best
of
terms
indeed
the
bishop
often
stayed
at
coplesey
pronounced
copsey
hall
lord
beamys
place
in
the
west
lucian
had
mentioned
the
name
of
de
carti
with
intention
and
had
perhaps
exaggerated
a
little
dixon
respectful
manner
he
knew
such
incidents
cheered
his
father
who
could
never
look
at
these
subjects
from
a
proper
point
of
view
and
as
people
said
sometimes
made
the
strangest
remarks
for
a
clergyman
this
irreverent
way
of
treating
serious
things
was
one
of
the
great
bonds
between
father
and
son
but
it
tended
to
increase
their
isolation
people
said
they
would
often
have
liked
to
asked
taylor
to
and
and
other
cheap
entertainments
if
only
he
had
not
been
such
an
man
and
so
indeed
a
year
before
taylor
had
gone
to
a
at
the
castle
caermaen
and
had
made
such
fun
of
the
bishop
recent
address
on
missions
to
the
portuguese
that
the
gervases
and
dixons
and
all
who
heard
him
were
quite
shocked
and
annoyed
and
as
meyrick
of
lanyravon
observed
his
black
coat
was
perfectly
with
age
so
on
the
whole
the
gervases
did
not
like
to
invite
taylor
again
as
for
the
son
nobody
cared
to
have
him
dixon
as
she
said
to
her
husband
really
asked
him
out
of
charity
i
am
afraid
he
seldom
gets
a
real
meal
at
home
she
remarked
so
i
thought
he
would
enjoy
a
good
wholesome
tea
for
once
in
a
way
but
he
is
such
an
boy
he
would
only
have
one
slice
of
that
nice
plain
cake
and
i
could
get
him
to
take
more
than
two
plums
they
were
really
quite
ripe
too
and
boys
are
usually
so
fond
of
fruit
thus
lucian
was
forced
to
spend
his
holidays
chiefly
in
his
own
company
and
make
the
best
he
could
of
the
ripe
peaches
on
the
south
wall
of
the
rectory
garden
there
was
a
certain
corner
where
the
heat
of
that
hot
august
seemed
concentrated
reverberated
from
one
wall
to
the
other
and
here
he
liked
to
linger
of
mornings
when
the
mists
were
still
thick
in
the
valleys
mooning
meditating
extending
his
walk
from
the
quince
to
the
medlar
and
back
again
beside
the
moldering
walls
of
mellowed
brick
he
was
full
of
a
certain
wonder
and
awe
not
unmixed
with
a
swell
of
strange
exultation
and
wished
more
and
more
to
be
alone
to
think
over
that
wonderful
afternoon
within
the
fort
in
spite
of
himself
the
impression
was
fading
he
could
not
understand
that
feeling
of
mad
panic
terror
that
drove
him
through
the
thicket
and
down
the
steep
hillside
yet
he
had
experienced
so
clearly
the
physical
shame
and
reluctance
of
the
flesh
he
recollected
that
for
a
few
seconds
after
his
awakening
the
sight
of
his
own
body
had
made
him
shudder
and
writhe
as
if
it
had
suffered
some
profoundest
degradation
he
saw
before
him
a
vision
of
two
forms
a
faun
with
tingling
and
prickling
flesh
lay
expectant
in
the
sunlight
and
there
was
also
the
likeness
of
a
miserable
shamed
boy
standing
with
trembling
body
and
shaking
unsteady
hands
it
was
all
confused
a
procession
of
blurred
images
now
of
rapture
and
ecstasy
and
now
of
terror
and
shame
floating
in
a
light
that
was
altogether
phantasmal
and
unreal
he
dared
not
approach
the
fort
again
he
lingered
in
the
road
to
caermaen
that
passed
behind
it
but
a
mile
away
and
separated
by
the
wild
land
and
a
strip
of
wood
from
the
towering
battlements
here
he
was
looking
over
a
gate
one
day
doubtful
and
wondering
when
he
heard
a
heavy
step
behind
him
and
glancing
round
quickly
saw
it
was
old
morgan
of
the
white
house
good
afternoon
master
lucian
he
began
taylor
pretty
well
i
suppose
i
be
goin
to
the
house
a
minute
the
men
in
the
fields
are
wantin
some
more
cider
would
you
come
and
taste
a
drop
of
cider
master
lucian
it
very
good
sir
indeed
lucian
did
not
want
any
cider
but
he
thought
it
would
please
old
morgan
if
he
took
some
so
he
said
he
should
like
to
taste
the
cider
very
much
indeed
morgan
was
a
sturdy
old
man
of
the
ancient
stock
a
stiff
churchman
who
breakfasted
regularly
on
fat
broth
and
caerphilly
cheese
in
the
fashion
of
his
ancestors
hot
spiced
elder
wine
was
for
winter
nights
and
gin
for
festal
seasons
the
farm
had
always
been
the
freehold
of
the
family
and
when
lucian
in
the
wake
of
the
yeoman
passed
through
the
deep
porch
by
the
oaken
door
down
into
the
long
dark
kitchen
he
felt
as
though
the
seventeenth
century
still
lingered
on
one
mullioned
window
set
deep
in
the
sloping
wall
gave
all
the
light
there
was
through
quarries
of
thick
glass
in
which
there
were
whorls
and
circles
so
that
the
lapping
and
the
garden
and
the
fields
beyond
were
distorted
to
the
sight
two
heavy
beams
oaken
but
whitewashed
ran
across
the
ceiling
a
little
glow
of
fire
sparkled
in
the
great
fireplace
and
a
curl
of
blue
smoke
fled
up
the
cavern
of
the
chimney
here
was
the
genuine
of
our
fathers
there
were
seats
on
each
side
of
the
fireplace
where
one
could
sit
snug
and
sheltered
on
december
nights
warm
and
merry
in
the
blazing
light
and
listen
to
the
battle
of
the
storm
and
hear
the
flame
spit
and
hiss
at
the
falling
snowflakes
at
the
back
of
the
fire
were
great
blackened
tiles
with
raised
initials
and
a
sit
down
master
lucian
sit
down
sir
said
morgan
annie
he
called
through
one
of
the
numerous
doors
here
master
lucian
the
parson
would
like
a
drop
of
cider
fetch
a
jug
will
you
directly
very
well
father
came
the
voice
from
the
dairy
and
presently
the
girl
entered
wiping
the
jug
she
held
in
his
boyish
way
lucian
had
been
a
good
deal
disturbed
by
annie
morgan
he
could
see
her
on
sundays
from
his
seat
in
church
and
her
skin
curiously
pale
her
lips
that
seemed
as
though
they
were
stained
with
some
brilliant
pigment
her
black
hair
and
the
quivering
black
eyes
gave
him
odd
fancies
which
he
had
hardly
shaped
to
himself
annie
had
grown
into
a
woman
in
three
years
and
he
was
still
a
boy
she
came
into
the
kitchen
curtsying
and
smiling
master
lucian
and
how
is
taylor
sir
pretty
well
thank
you
i
hope
you
are
well
nicely
sir
thank
you
how
nice
your
voice
do
sound
in
church
master
lucian
to
be
sure
i
was
telling
father
about
it
last
sunday
lucian
grinned
and
felt
uncomfortable
and
the
girl
set
down
the
jug
on
the
round
table
and
brought
a
glass
from
the
dresser
she
bent
close
over
him
as
she
poured
out
the
green
oily
cider
fragrant
of
the
orchard
her
hand
touched
his
shoulder
for
a
moment
and
she
said
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
very
prettily
he
looked
up
eagerly
at
her
face
the
black
eyes
a
little
oval
in
shape
were
shining
and
the
lips
smiled
annie
wore
a
plain
dress
of
some
black
stuff
open
at
the
throat
her
skin
was
beautiful
for
a
moment
the
ghost
of
a
fancy
hovered
unsubstantial
in
his
mind
and
then
annie
curtsied
as
she
handed
him
the
cider
and
replied
to
his
thanks
with
and
welcome
kindly
sir
the
drink
was
really
good
not
thin
nor
sweet
but
round
and
full
and
generous
with
a
fine
yellow
flame
twinkling
through
the
green
when
one
held
it
up
to
the
light
it
was
like
a
stray
sunbeam
hovering
on
the
grass
in
a
deep
orchard
and
he
swallowed
the
glassful
with
relish
and
had
some
more
warmly
commending
it
morgan
was
touched
i
see
you
do
know
a
good
thing
sir
he
said
is
indeed
now
good
stuff
though
it
my
own
makin
my
old
grandfather
he
planted
the
trees
in
the
time
of
the
wars
and
he
was
a
very
good
judge
of
an
apple
in
his
day
and
generation
and
a
famous
grafter
he
was
to
be
sure
you
will
never
see
no
swelling
in
the
trees
he
grafted
at
all
whatever
now
there
james
morris
penyrhaul
he
a
famous
grafter
too
and
yet
them
redstreaks
he
grafted
for
me
five
year
ago
they
be
all
below
the
graft
already
would
you
like
to
taste
a
blemmin
pippin
now
master
lucian
there
be
a
few
left
in
the
loft
i
believe
lucian
said
he
should
like
an
apple
very
much
and
the
farmer
went
out
by
another
door
and
annie
stayed
in
the
kitchen
talking
she
said
trevor
her
married
sister
was
coming
to
them
soon
to
spend
a
few
days
she
got
such
a
beautiful
baby
said
annie
and
he
quite
already
though
he
only
nine
months
old
mary
would
like
to
see
you
sir
if
you
would
be
so
kind
as
to
step
in
that
is
if
not
troubling
you
at
all
master
lucian
i
suppose
you
must
be
getting
a
fine
scholar
now
sir
i
am
doing
pretty
well
thank
you
said
the
boy
i
was
first
in
my
form
last
term
fancy
to
think
of
that
hear
father
what
a
scholar
master
lucian
be
getting
he
be
a
rare
grammarian
i
sure
said
the
farmer
you
do
take
after
your
father
sir
i
always
do
say
that
nobody
have
got
such
a
good
deliverance
in
the
pulpit
lucian
did
not
find
the
blenheim
orange
as
good
as
the
cider
but
he
ate
it
with
all
the
appearance
of
relish
and
put
another
with
thanks
in
his
pocket
he
thanked
the
farmer
again
when
he
got
up
to
go
and
annie
curtsied
and
smiled
and
wished
him
and
welcome
kindly
lucian
heard
her
saying
to
her
father
as
he
went
out
what
a
young
gentleman
he
was
getting
to
be
sure
and
he
went
on
his
way
thinking
that
annie
was
really
very
pretty
and
speculating
as
to
whether
he
would
have
the
courage
to
kiss
her
if
they
met
in
a
dark
lane
he
was
quite
sure
she
would
only
laugh
and
say
oh
master
lucian
for
many
months
he
had
occasional
fits
of
recollection
both
cold
and
hot
but
the
bridge
of
time
gradually
lengthening
made
those
dreadful
and
delicious
images
grow
more
and
more
indistinct
till
at
last
they
all
passed
into
that
wonderland
which
a
youth
looks
back
upon
in
amazement
not
knowing
why
this
used
to
be
a
symbol
of
terror
or
that
of
joy
at
the
end
of
each
term
he
would
come
home
and
find
his
father
a
little
more
despondent
and
harder
to
cheer
even
for
a
moment
and
the
wall
paper
and
the
furniture
grew
more
and
more
dingy
and
shabby
the
two
cats
loved
and
ancient
beasts
that
he
remembered
when
he
was
quite
a
little
boy
before
he
went
to
school
died
miserably
one
after
the
other
old
polly
the
pony
at
last
fell
down
in
the
stable
from
the
weakness
of
old
age
and
had
to
be
killed
there
the
battered
old
trap
ran
no
longer
along
the
lanes
there
was
long
meadow
grass
on
the
lawn
and
the
trained
fruit
trees
on
the
wall
had
got
quite
out
of
hand
at
last
when
lucian
was
seventeen
his
father
was
obliged
to
take
him
from
school
he
could
no
longer
afford
the
fees
this
was
the
sorry
ending
of
many
hopes
and
dreams
of
a
a
fellowship
distinction
and
glory
that
the
poor
parson
had
long
entertained
for
his
son
and
the
two
moped
together
in
the
shabby
room
one
on
each
side
of
the
sulky
fire
thinking
of
dead
days
and
finished
plans
and
seeing
a
grey
future
in
the
years
that
advanced
towards
them
at
one
time
there
seemed
some
chance
of
a
distant
relative
coming
forward
to
lucian
assistance
and
indeed
it
was
quite
settled
that
he
should
go
up
to
london
with
certain
definite
aims
taylor
told
the
good
news
to
his
acquaintances
his
coat
was
too
green
now
for
any
pretence
of
friendship
and
lucian
himself
spoke
of
his
plans
to
burrows
the
doctor
and
dixon
and
one
or
two
others
then
the
whole
scheme
fell
through
and
the
parson
and
his
son
suffered
much
sympathy
people
of
course
had
to
say
they
were
sorry
but
in
reality
the
news
was
received
with
high
spirits
with
the
joy
with
which
one
sees
a
stone
as
it
rolls
down
a
steep
place
give
yet
another
bounding
leap
towards
the
pool
beneath
dixon
heard
the
pleasant
tidings
from
colley
who
came
in
to
talk
about
the
mothers
meeting
and
the
band
of
hope
dixon
was
nursing
little
athelwig
or
some
such
name
at
the
time
and
made
many
affecting
observations
on
the
general
righteousness
with
which
the
world
was
governed
indeed
poor
lucian
disappointment
seemed
distinctly
to
increase
her
faith
in
the
divine
order
as
if
it
had
been
some
example
in
butler
are
taylor
views
very
she
said
to
her
husband
the
same
evening
i
am
afraid
they
are
he
replied
i
was
quite
at
the
last
diocesan
conference
at
the
way
in
which
he
spoke
the
dear
old
bishop
had
given
an
address
on
auricular
confession
he
was
to
do
so
you
know
after
what
had
happened
and
i
must
say
that
i
never
felt
prouder
of
our
beloved
church
dixon
told
all
the
homeric
story
of
the
conference
reciting
the
achievements
of
the
champions
deploring
this
and
applauding
that
it
seemed
that
taylor
had
had
the
audacity
to
quote
authorities
which
the
bishop
could
not
very
well
repudiate
though
they
were
directly
opposed
to
the
safe
episcopal
pronouncement
dixon
of
course
was
grieved
it
was
sad
to
think
of
a
clergyman
behaving
so
shamefully
but
you
know
dear
she
proceeded
i
have
been
thinking
about
that
unfortunate
taylor
boy
and
his
disappointments
and
after
what
just
told
me
i
am
sure
it
some
kind
of
judgment
on
them
both
has
taylor
forgotten
the
vows
he
took
at
his
ordination
but
do
you
think
dear
i
am
right
and
that
he
has
been
punished
sins
of
the
fathers
somehow
or
other
lucian
divined
the
atmosphere
of
threatenings
and
judgments
and
shrank
more
and
more
from
the
small
society
of
the
countryside
for
his
part
when
he
was
not
mooning
in
the
beloved
fields
and
woods
of
happy
memory
he
shut
himself
up
with
books
reading
whatever
could
be
found
on
the
shelves
and
amassing
a
store
of
incongruous
and
obsolete
knowledge
long
did
he
linger
with
the
men
of
the
seventeenth
century
delaying
the
gay
sunlit
streets
with
pepys
and
listening
to
the
charmed
sound
of
the
restoration
revel
roaming
by
peaceful
streams
with
izaak
walton
and
the
great
catholic
divines
enchanted
with
the
portrait
of
herbert
the
loving
ascetic
awed
by
the
mystic
breath
of
crashaw
then
the
cavalier
poets
sang
their
gallant
songs
and
herrick
made
dean
prior
magic
ground
by
the
holy
incantation
of
a
verse
and
in
the
old
proverbs
and
homely
sayings
of
the
time
he
found
the
good
and
beautiful
english
life
a
time
full
of
grace
and
dignity
and
rich
merriment
he
dived
deeper
and
deeper
into
his
books
he
had
taken
all
obsolescence
to
be
his
province
in
his
disgust
at
the
stupid
usual
questions
will
it
pay
what
good
is
it
and
so
forth
he
would
only
read
what
was
uncouth
and
useless
the
strange
pomp
and
symbolism
of
the
cabala
with
its
hint
of
more
terrible
things
the
rosicrucian
mysteries
of
fludd
the
enigmas
of
vaughan
dreams
of
alchemists
all
these
were
his
delight
such
were
his
companions
with
the
hills
and
hanging
woods
the
brooks
and
lonely
waterpools
books
the
thoughts
of
books
the
stirrings
of
imagination
all
fused
into
one
phantasy
by
the
magic
of
the
outland
country
he
held
himself
aloof
from
the
walls
of
the
fort
he
was
content
to
see
the
heaped
mounds
the
violent
height
with
faerie
bulwarks
from
the
gate
in
the
lane
and
to
leave
all
within
the
ring
of
oaks
in
the
mystery
of
his
boyhood
vision
he
professed
to
laugh
at
himself
and
at
his
fancies
of
that
hot
august
afternoon
when
sleep
came
to
him
within
the
thicket
but
in
his
heart
of
hearts
there
was
something
that
never
faded
something
that
glowed
like
the
red
glint
of
a
gypsy
fire
seen
from
afar
across
the
hills
and
mists
of
the
night
and
known
to
be
burning
in
a
wild
land
sometimes
when
he
was
sunken
in
his
books
the
flame
of
delight
shot
up
and
showed
him
a
whole
province
and
continent
of
his
nature
all
shining
and
aglow
and
in
the
midst
of
the
exultation
and
triumph
he
would
draw
back
a
little
afraid
he
had
become
ascetic
in
his
studious
and
melancholy
isolation
and
the
vision
of
such
ecstasies
frightened
him
he
began
to
write
a
little
at
first
very
tentatively
and
feebly
and
then
with
more
confidence
he
showed
some
of
his
verses
to
his
father
who
told
him
with
a
sigh
that
he
had
once
hoped
to
write
in
the
old
days
at
oxford
he
added
they
are
very
nicely
done
said
the
parson
but
i
afraid
you
find
anybody
to
print
them
my
boy
so
he
pottered
on
reading
everything
imitating
what
struck
his
fancy
attempting
the
effect
of
the
classic
meters
in
english
verse
trying
his
hand
at
a
masque
a
restoration
comedy
forming
impossible
plans
for
books
which
rarely
got
beyond
half
a
dozen
lines
on
a
sheet
of
paper
beset
with
splendid
fancies
which
refused
to
abide
before
the
pen
but
the
vain
joy
of
conception
was
not
altogether
vain
for
it
gave
him
some
armor
about
his
heart
the
months
went
by
monotonous
and
sometimes
blotted
with
despair
he
wrote
and
planned
and
filled
the
basket
with
hopeless
efforts
now
and
then
he
sent
verses
or
prose
articles
to
magazines
in
pathetic
ignorance
of
the
trade
he
felt
the
immense
difficulty
of
the
career
of
literature
without
clearly
understanding
it
the
battle
was
happily
in
a
mist
so
that
the
host
of
the
enemy
terribly
arrayed
was
to
some
extent
hidden
yet
there
was
enough
of
difficulty
to
appall
from
following
the
intricate
course
of
little
nameless
brooks
from
hushed
twilight
woods
from
the
vision
of
the
mountains
and
the
breath
of
the
great
wind
passing
from
deep
to
deep
he
would
come
home
filled
with
thoughts
and
emotions
mystic
fancies
which
he
yearned
to
translate
into
the
written
word
and
the
result
of
the
effort
seemed
always
to
be
bathos
wooden
sentences
a
portentous
stilted
style
obscurity
and
awkwardness
clogged
the
pen
it
seemed
impossible
to
win
the
great
secret
of
language
the
stars
glittered
only
in
the
darkness
and
vanished
away
in
clearer
light
the
periods
of
despair
were
often
long
and
heavy
the
victories
very
few
and
trifling
night
after
night
he
sat
writing
after
his
father
had
knocked
out
his
last
pipe
filling
a
page
with
difficulty
in
an
hour
and
usually
forced
to
thrust
the
stuff
away
in
despair
and
go
unhappily
to
bed
conscious
that
after
all
his
labor
he
had
done
nothing
and
these
were
moments
when
the
accustomed
vision
of
the
land
alarmed
him
and
the
wild
domed
hills
and
darkling
woods
seemed
symbols
of
some
terrible
secret
in
the
inner
life
of
that
stranger
himself
sometimes
when
he
was
deep
in
his
books
and
papers
sometimes
on
a
lonely
walk
sometimes
amidst
the
tiresome
chatter
of
caermaen
society
he
would
thrill
with
a
sudden
sense
of
awful
hidden
things
and
there
ran
that
quivering
flame
through
his
nerves
that
brought
back
the
recollection
of
the
matted
thicket
and
that
earlier
appearance
of
the
bare
black
boughs
enwrapped
with
flames
indeed
though
he
avoided
the
solitary
lane
and
the
sight
of
the
sheer
height
with
its
ring
of
oaks
and
molded
mounds
the
image
of
it
grew
more
intense
as
the
symbol
of
certain
hints
and
suggestions
the
exultant
and
insurgent
flesh
seemed
to
have
its
temple
and
castle
within
those
olden
walls
and
he
longed
with
all
his
heart
to
escape
to
set
himself
free
in
the
wilderness
of
london
and
to
be
secure
amidst
the
murmur
of
modern
streets
ii
lucian
was
growing
really
anxious
about
his
manuscript
he
had
gained
enough
experience
at
to
know
that
editors
and
publishers
must
not
be
hurried
but
his
book
had
been
lying
at
messrs
office
for
more
than
three
months
for
six
weeks
he
had
not
dared
to
expect
an
answer
but
afterwards
life
had
become
agonizing
every
morning
at
the
poor
wretch
nearly
choked
with
anxiety
to
know
whether
his
sentence
had
arrived
and
the
rest
of
the
day
was
racked
with
alternate
pangs
of
hope
and
despair
now
and
then
he
was
almost
assured
of
success
conning
over
these
painful
and
eager
pages
in
memory
he
found
parts
that
were
admirable
while
again
his
inexperience
reproached
him
and
he
feared
he
had
written
a
raw
and
awkward
book
wholly
unfit
for
print
then
he
would
compare
what
he
remembered
of
it
with
notable
magazine
articles
and
books
praised
by
reviewers
and
fancy
that
after
all
there
might
be
good
points
in
the
thing
he
could
not
help
liking
the
first
chapter
for
instance
perhaps
the
letter
might
come
tomorrow
so
it
went
on
week
after
week
of
sick
torture
made
more
exquisite
by
such
gleams
of
hope
it
was
as
if
he
were
stretched
in
anguish
on
the
rack
and
the
pain
relaxed
and
kind
words
spoken
now
and
again
by
the
tormentors
and
then
once
more
the
grinding
pang
and
burning
agony
at
last
he
could
bear
suspense
no
longer
and
he
wrote
to
messrs
beit
inquiring
in
a
humble
manner
whether
the
manuscript
had
arrived
in
safety
the
firm
replied
in
a
very
polite
letter
expressing
regret
that
their
reader
had
been
suffering
from
a
cold
in
the
head
and
had
therefore
been
unable
to
send
in
his
report
a
final
decision
was
promised
in
a
week
time
and
the
letter
ended
with
apologies
for
the
delay
and
a
hope
that
he
had
suffered
no
inconvenience
of
course
the
final
decision
did
not
come
at
the
end
of
the
week
but
the
book
was
returned
at
the
end
of
three
weeks
with
a
circular
thanking
the
author
for
his
kindness
in
submitting
the
manuscript
and
regretting
that
the
firm
did
not
see
their
way
to
producing
it
he
felt
relieved
the
operation
that
he
had
dreaded
and
deprecated
for
so
long
was
at
last
over
and
he
would
no
longer
grow
sick
of
mornings
when
the
letters
were
brought
in
he
took
his
parcel
to
the
sunny
corner
of
the
garden
where
the
old
wooden
seat
stood
sheltered
from
the
biting
march
winds
messrs
beit
had
put
in
with
the
circular
one
of
their
short
lists
a
neat
booklet
headed
beit
recent
he
settled
himself
comfortably
on
the
seat
lit
his
pipe
and
began
to
read
bad
un
to
beat
a
novel
of
sporting
life
by
the
honorable
scudamore
runnymede
author
of
with
the
mudshire
pack
the
sportleigh
vols
at
all
libraries
the
it
seemed
pronounced
this
to
be
a
charming
book
runnymede
has
wit
and
humor
enough
to
furnish
forth
ordinary
sporting
novels
told
with
the
sparkle
and
vivacity
of
a
in
the
art
of
novel
writing
said
the
while
miranda
of
positively
bubbled
with
enthusiasm
you
must
forgive
me
aminta
wrote
this
young
person
if
i
have
not
sent
the
description
i
promised
of
madame
lulu
new
creations
and
others
of
that
ilk
i
must
a
tale
unfold
tom
came
in
yesterday
and
began
to
rave
about
the
honorable
scudamore
runnymede
last
novel
bad
un
to
he
says
all
the
smart
set
are
talking
of
it
and
it
seems
the
police
have
to
regulate
the
crowd
at
mudie
you
know
i
read
everything
runnymede
writes
so
i
set
out
miggs
directly
to
beg
borrow
or
steal
a
copy
and
i
confess
i
burnt
the
midnight
oil
before
i
laid
it
down
now
mind
you
get
it
you
will
find
it
so
awfully
nearly
all
the
novelists
on
messrs
beit
list
were
ladies
their
works
all
ran
to
three
volumes
and
all
of
them
pleased
the
the
and
miranda
of
one
of
these
books
by
sarah
pocklington
sanders
was
pronounced
fit
to
lie
on
the
table
on
the
bookshelf
or
beneath
the
pillow
of
the
most
gently
nurtured
of
our
daughters
this
the
reviewer
went
on
is
high
praise
especially
in
these
days
when
we
are
deafened
by
the
clamor
of
we
would
warn
the
young
men
who
prate
so
persistently
of
style
and
literature
construction
and
prose
harmonies
that
we
believe
the
english
reading
public
will
have
none
of
them
harmless
amusement
a
gentle
flow
of
domestic
interest
a
faithful
reproduction
of
the
open
and
manly
life
of
the
hunting
field
pictures
of
innocent
and
healthy
english
girlhood
such
as
miss
sanders
here
affords
us
these
are
the
topics
that
will
always
find
a
welcome
in
our
homes
which
remain
bolted
and
barred
against
the
abandoned
artist
and
the
scrofulous
stylist
he
turned
over
the
pages
of
the
little
book
and
chuckled
in
high
relish
he
discovered
an
honest
enthusiasm
a
determination
to
strike
a
blow
for
the
good
and
true
that
refreshed
and
exhilarated
a
beaming
face
spectacled
and
whiskered
probably
an
expansive
waistcoat
and
a
tender
heart
seemed
to
shine
through
the
words
which
messrs
beit
had
quoted
and
the
alliteration
of
the
final
sentence
that
was
good
too
there
was
style
for
you
if
you
wanted
it
the
champion
of
the
blushing
cheek
and
the
gushing
eye
showed
that
he
too
could
handle
the
weapons
of
the
enemy
if
he
cared
to
trouble
himself
with
such
things
lucian
leant
back
and
roared
with
indecent
laughter
till
the
tabby
who
had
succeeded
to
the
poor
dead
beasts
looked
up
reproachfully
from
his
sunny
corner
with
a
face
like
the
reviewer
innocent
and
round
and
whiskered
at
last
he
turned
to
his
parcel
and
drew
out
some
sheets
of
manuscript
and
began
to
read
in
a
rather
desponding
spirit
it
was
pretty
obvious
he
thought
that
the
stuff
was
poor
and
beneath
the
standard
of
publication
the
book
had
taken
a
year
and
a
half
in
the
making
it
was
a
pious
attempt
to
translate
into
english
prose
the
form
and
mystery
of
the
domed
hills
the
magic
of
occult
valleys
the
sound
of
the
red
swollen
brook
swirling
through
leafless
woods
and
toil
at
nights
had
gone
into
the
eager
pages
he
had
labored
hard
to
do
his
very
best
writing
and
rewriting
weighing
his
cadences
beginning
over
and
over
again
grudging
no
patience
no
trouble
if
only
it
might
be
pretty
good
good
enough
to
print
and
sell
to
a
reading
public
which
had
become
critical
he
glanced
through
the
manuscript
in
his
hand
and
to
his
astonishment
he
could
not
help
thinking
that
in
its
measure
it
was
decent
work
after
three
months
his
prose
seemed
fresh
and
strange
as
if
it
had
been
wrought
by
another
man
and
in
spite
of
himself
he
found
charming
things
and
impressions
that
were
not
commonplace
he
knew
how
weak
it
all
was
compared
with
his
own
conceptions
he
had
seen
an
enchanted
city
awful
glorious
with
flame
smitten
about
its
battlements
like
the
cities
of
the
sangraal
and
he
had
molded
his
copy
in
such
poor
clay
as
came
to
his
hand
yet
in
spite
of
the
gulf
that
yawned
between
the
idea
and
the
work
he
knew
as
he
read
that
the
thing
accomplished
was
very
far
from
a
failure
he
put
back
the
leaves
carefully
and
glanced
again
at
messrs
beit
list
it
had
escaped
his
notice
that
bad
un
to
was
in
its
third
edition
it
was
a
great
thing
at
all
events
to
know
in
what
direction
to
aim
if
he
wished
to
succeed
if
he
worked
hard
he
thought
he
might
some
day
win
the
approval
of
the
coy
and
retiring
miranda
of
that
modest
maiden
might
in
his
praise
interrupt
her
task
of
disinterested
advertisement
her
philanthropic
counsels
to
go
to
jumper
and
mind
you
ask
for
jumper
who
will
show
you
the
lovely
blue
paper
with
the
yellow
spots
at
ten
shillings
the
piece
he
put
down
the
pamphlet
and
laughed
again
at
the
books
and
the
reviewers
so
that
he
might
not
weep
this
then
was
english
fiction
this
was
english
criticism
and
farce
after
all
was
but
an
tragedy
the
rejected
manuscript
was
hidden
away
and
his
father
quoted
maxim
as
to
the
benefit
of
keeping
literary
works
for
some
time
in
the
wood
there
was
nothing
to
grumble
at
though
lucian
was
inclined
to
think
the
duration
of
the
reader
catarrh
a
little
exaggerated
but
this
was
a
trifle
he
did
not
arrogate
to
himself
the
position
of
a
small
commercial
traveler
who
expects
prompt
civility
as
a
matter
of
course
and
not
at
all
as
a
favor
he
simply
forgot
his
old
book
and
resolved
that
he
would
make
a
better
one
if
he
could
with
the
hot
fit
of
resolution
the
determination
not
to
be
snuffed
out
by
one
refusal
upon
him
he
began
to
beat
about
in
his
mind
for
some
new
scheme
at
first
it
seemed
that
he
had
hit
upon
a
promising
subject
he
began
to
plot
out
chapters
and
scribble
hints
for
the
curious
story
that
had
entered
his
mind
arranging
his
circumstances
and
noting
the
effects
to
be
produced
with
all
the
enthusiasm
of
the
artist
but
after
the
first
breath
the
aspect
of
the
work
changed
page
after
page
was
tossed
aside
as
hopeless
the
beautiful
sentences
he
had
dreamed
of
refused
to
be
written
and
his
puppets
remained
stiff
and
wooden
devoid
of
life
or
motion
then
all
the
old
despairs
came
back
the
agonies
of
the
artificer
who
strives
and
perseveres
in
vain
the
scheme
that
seemed
of
amorous
fire
turned
to
cold
hard
ice
in
his
hands
he
let
the
pen
drop
from
his
fingers
and
wondered
how
he
could
have
ever
dreamed
of
writing
books
again
the
thought
occurred
that
he
might
do
something
if
he
could
only
get
away
and
join
the
sad
procession
in
the
murmuring
london
streets
far
from
the
shadow
of
those
awful
hills
but
it
was
quite
impossible
the
relative
who
had
once
promised
assistance
was
appealed
to
and
wrote
expressing
his
regret
that
lucian
had
turned
out
a
loafer
wasting
his
time
in
scribbling
instead
of
trying
to
earn
his
living
lucian
felt
rather
hurt
at
this
letter
but
the
parson
only
grinned
grimly
as
usual
he
was
thinking
of
how
he
signed
a
check
many
years
before
in
the
days
of
his
prosperity
and
the
check
was
payable
to
this
didactic
relative
then
in
but
a
poor
way
and
of
a
thankful
turn
of
mind
the
old
rejected
manuscript
had
almost
passed
out
of
his
recollection
it
was
recalled
oddly
enough
he
was
looking
over
the
and
enjoying
the
admirable
literary
criticisms
some
three
months
after
the
return
of
his
book
when
his
eye
was
attracted
by
a
quoted
passage
in
one
of
the
notices
the
thought
and
style
both
wakened
memory
the
cadences
were
familiar
and
beloved
he
read
through
the
review
from
the
beginning
it
was
a
very
favorable
one
and
pronounced
the
volume
an
immense
advance
on
ritson
previous
work
here
undoubtedly
the
author
has
discovered
a
vein
of
pure
metal
the
reviewer
added
and
we
predict
that
he
will
go
far
lucian
had
not
yet
reached
his
father
stage
he
was
unable
to
grin
in
the
manner
of
that
irreverent
parson
the
passage
selected
for
high
praise
was
taken
almost
word
for
word
from
the
manuscript
now
resting
in
his
room
the
work
that
had
not
reached
the
high
standard
of
messrs
beit
who
curiously
enough
were
the
publishers
of
the
book
reviewed
in
the
he
had
a
few
shillings
in
his
possession
and
wrote
at
once
to
a
bookseller
in
london
for
a
copy
of
chorus
in
as
the
author
had
oddly
named
the
book
he
wrote
on
june
and
thought
he
might
fairly
expect
to
receive
the
interesting
volume
by
the
but
the
postman
true
to
his
tradition
brought
nothing
for
him
and
in
the
afternoon
he
resolved
to
walk
down
to
caermaen
in
case
it
might
have
come
by
a
second
post
or
it
might
have
been
mislaid
at
the
office
they
forgot
parcels
sometimes
especially
when
the
bag
was
heavy
and
the
weather
hot
this
was
a
sultry
and
oppressive
day
a
grey
veil
of
cloud
obscured
the
sky
and
a
vaporous
mist
hung
heavily
over
the
land
and
fumed
up
from
the
valleys
but
at
five
when
he
started
the
clouds
began
to
break
and
the
sunlight
suddenly
streamed
down
through
the
misty
air
making
ways
and
channels
of
rich
glory
and
bright
islands
in
the
gloom
it
was
a
pleasant
and
shining
evening
when
passing
by
devious
back
streets
to
avoid
the
barbarians
as
he
very
rudely
called
the
respectable
inhabitants
of
the
town
he
reached
the
which
was
also
the
general
shop
yes
taylor
there
is
something
for
you
sir
said
the
man
williams
the
postman
forgot
to
take
it
up
this
morning
and
he
handed
over
the
packet
lucian
took
it
under
his
arm
and
went
slowly
through
the
ragged
winding
lanes
till
he
came
into
the
country
he
got
over
the
first
stile
on
the
road
and
sitting
down
in
the
shelter
of
a
hedge
cut
the
strings
and
opened
the
parcel
chorus
in
was
got
up
in
what
reviewers
call
a
dainty
manner
a
cloth
gold
lettering
wide
margins
and
black
type
all
witnessed
to
the
good
taste
of
messrs
beit
co
he
cut
the
pages
hastily
and
began
to
read
he
soon
found
that
he
had
wronged
ritson
that
old
literary
hand
had
by
no
means
stolen
his
book
wholesale
as
he
had
expected
there
were
about
two
hundred
pages
in
the
pretty
little
volume
and
of
these
about
ninety
were
lucian
dovetailed
into
a
rather
different
scheme
with
skill
that
was
nothing
short
of
exquisite
and
ritson
own
work
was
often
very
good
spoilt
here
and
there
for
some
tastes
by
the
cataloguing
method
a
somewhat
materialistic
way
of
taking
an
inventory
of
the
holy
country
things
but
for
that
very
reason
contrasting
to
a
great
advantage
with
lucian
hints
and
dreams
and
note
of
haunting
and
here
and
there
ritson
had
made
little
alterations
in
the
style
of
the
passages
he
had
conveyed
and
most
of
these
alterations
were
amendments
as
lucian
was
obliged
to
confess
though
he
would
have
liked
to
argue
one
or
two
points
with
his
collaborator
and
corrector
he
lit
his
pipe
and
leant
back
comfortably
in
the
hedge
thinking
things
over
weighing
very
coolly
his
experience
of
humanity
his
contact
with
the
society
of
the
countryside
the
affair
of
the
chorus
in
and
even
some
little
incidents
that
had
struck
him
as
he
was
walking
through
the
streets
of
caermaen
that
evening
at
the
when
he
was
inquiring
for
his
parcel
he
had
heard
two
old
women
grumbling
in
the
street
it
seemed
so
far
as
he
could
make
out
that
both
had
been
disappointed
in
much
the
same
way
one
was
a
roman
catholic
hardened
and
beyond
the
reach
of
conversion
she
had
been
advised
to
ask
alms
of
the
priests
who
are
always
creeping
and
crawling
about
the
other
old
sinner
was
a
dissenter
and
dixon
has
quite
enough
to
do
to
relieve
good
church
people
dixon
assisted
by
henrietta
was
it
seemed
the
lady
high
almoner
who
dispensed
these
charities
as
she
said
to
colley
they
would
end
by
keeping
all
the
beggars
in
the
county
and
they
really
could
afford
it
a
large
family
was
an
expensive
thing
and
the
girls
have
new
frocks
dixon
is
always
telling
me
and
the
girls
that
we
must
not
the
people
by
indiscriminate
charity
lucian
had
heard
of
these
sage
counsels
and
through
it
them
as
he
listened
to
the
bitter
complaints
of
the
gaunt
hungry
old
women
in
the
back
street
by
which
he
passed
out
of
the
town
he
saw
a
large
healthy
boy
kicking
a
sick
cat
the
poor
creature
had
just
strength
enough
to
crawl
under
an
outhouse
door
probably
to
die
in
torments
he
did
not
find
much
satisfaction
in
thrashing
the
boy
but
he
did
it
with
hearty
good
will
further
on
at
the
corner
where
the
turnpike
used
to
be
was
a
big
notice
announcing
a
meeting
at
the
in
aid
of
the
missions
to
the
portuguese
under
the
patronage
of
the
lord
bishop
of
the
diocese
was
the
imposing
headline
the
reverend
merivale
dixon
vicar
of
caermaen
was
to
be
in
the
chair
supported
by
stanley
gervase
and
by
many
of
the
clergy
and
gentry
of
the
neighborhood
senhor
diabo
formerly
a
romanist
priest
now
an
evangelist
in
lisbon
would
address
the
meeting
funds
are
urgently
needed
to
carry
on
this
good
work
concluded
the
notice
so
he
lay
well
back
in
the
shade
of
the
hedge
and
thought
whether
some
sort
of
an
article
could
not
be
made
by
vindicating
the
terrible
yahoos
one
might
point
out
that
they
were
in
many
respects
a
simple
and
unsophisticated
race
whose
faults
were
the
result
of
their
enslaved
position
while
such
virtues
as
they
had
were
all
their
own
they
might
be
compared
he
thought
much
to
their
advantage
with
more
complex
civilizations
there
was
no
hint
of
anything
like
the
beit
system
of
publishing
in
existence
amongst
them
the
great
yahoo
nation
would
surely
never
feed
and
encourage
a
scabby
houyhnhnm
expelled
for
his
foulness
from
the
and
the
witty
dean
in
all
his
minuteness
had
said
nothing
of
safe
yahoos
on
reflection
however
he
did
not
feel
quite
secure
of
this
part
of
his
defense
he
remembered
that
the
leading
brutes
had
favorites
who
were
employed
in
certain
simple
domestic
offices
about
their
masters
and
it
seemed
doubtful
whether
the
contemplated
vindication
would
not
break
down
on
this
point
he
smiled
queerly
to
himself
as
he
thought
of
these
comparisons
but
his
heart
burned
with
a
dull
fury
throwing
back
his
unhappy
memory
he
recalled
all
the
contempt
and
scorn
he
had
suffered
as
a
boy
he
had
heard
the
masters
murmuring
their
disdain
of
him
and
of
his
desire
to
learn
other
than
ordinary
school
work
as
a
young
man
he
had
suffered
the
insolence
of
these
wretched
people
about
him
their
cackling
laughter
at
his
poverty
jarred
and
grated
in
his
ears
he
saw
the
acrid
grin
of
some
miserable
idiot
woman
some
creature
beneath
the
swine
in
intelligence
and
manners
merciless
as
he
went
by
with
his
eyes
on
the
dust
in
his
ragged
clothes
he
and
his
father
seemed
to
pass
down
an
avenue
of
jeers
and
contempt
and
contempt
from
such
animals
as
these
this
putrid
filth
molded
into
human
shape
made
only
to
fawn
on
the
rich
and
beslaver
them
thinking
no
foulness
too
foul
if
it
were
done
in
honor
of
those
in
power
and
authority
and
no
refined
cruelty
of
contempt
too
cruel
if
it
were
contempt
of
the
poor
and
humble
and
oppressed
it
was
to
this
obscene
and
ghastly
throng
that
he
was
something
to
be
pointed
at
and
these
men
and
women
spoke
of
sacred
things
and
knelt
before
the
awful
altar
of
god
before
the
altar
of
tremendous
fire
surrounded
as
they
professed
by
angels
and
archangels
and
all
the
company
of
heaven
and
in
their
very
church
they
had
one
aisle
for
the
rich
and
another
for
the
poor
and
the
species
was
not
peculiar
to
caermaen
the
rich
business
men
in
london
and
the
successful
brother
author
were
probably
amusing
themselves
at
the
expense
of
the
poor
struggling
creature
they
had
injured
and
wounded
just
as
the
healthy
boy
had
burst
into
a
great
laugh
when
the
miserable
sick
cat
cried
out
in
bitter
agony
and
trailed
its
limbs
slowly
as
it
crept
away
to
die
lucian
looked
into
his
own
life
and
his
own
will
he
saw
that
in
spite
of
his
follies
and
his
want
of
success
he
had
not
been
consciously
malignant
he
had
never
deliberately
aided
in
oppression
or
looked
on
it
with
enjoyment
and
approval
and
he
felt
that
when
he
lay
dead
beneath
the
earth
eaten
by
swarming
worms
he
would
be
in
a
purer
company
than
now
when
he
lived
amongst
human
creatures
and
he
was
to
call
this
loathsome
beast
all
sting
and
filth
brother
i
had
rather
call
the
devils
my
brothers
he
said
in
his
heart
i
would
fare
better
in
hell
blood
was
in
his
eyes
and
as
he
looked
up
the
sky
seemed
of
blood
and
the
earth
burned
with
fire
the
sun
was
sinking
low
on
the
mountain
when
he
set
out
on
the
way
again
burrows
the
doctor
coming
home
in
his
trap
met
him
a
little
lower
on
the
road
and
gave
him
a
friendly
a
long
way
round
on
this
road
is
it
said
the
doctor
as
you
have
come
so
far
why
do
you
try
the
short
cut
across
the
fields
you
will
find
it
easily
enough
second
stile
on
the
left
hand
and
then
go
straight
ahead
he
thanked
burrows
and
said
he
would
try
the
short
cut
and
burrows
span
on
homeward
he
was
a
gruff
and
honest
bachelor
and
often
felt
very
sorry
for
the
lad
and
wished
he
could
help
him
as
he
drove
on
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
lucian
had
an
awful
look
on
his
face
and
he
was
sorry
he
had
not
asked
him
to
jump
in
and
to
come
to
supper
a
hearty
slice
of
beef
with
strong
ale
whisky
and
soda
afterwards
a
good
pipe
and
certain
rabelaisian
tales
which
the
doctor
had
treasured
for
many
years
would
have
done
the
poor
fellow
a
lot
of
good
he
was
certain
he
half
turned
round
on
his
seat
and
looked
to
see
if
lucian
were
still
in
sight
but
he
had
passed
the
corner
and
the
doctor
drove
on
shivering
a
little
the
mists
were
beginning
to
rise
from
the
wet
banks
of
the
river
lucian
trailed
slowly
along
the
road
keeping
a
look
out
for
the
stile
the
doctor
had
mentioned
it
would
be
a
little
of
an
adventure
he
thought
to
find
his
way
by
an
unknown
track
he
knew
the
direction
in
which
his
home
lay
and
he
imagined
he
would
not
have
much
difficulty
in
crossing
from
one
stile
to
another
the
path
led
him
up
a
steep
bare
field
and
when
he
was
at
the
top
the
town
and
the
valley
winding
up
to
the
north
stretched
before
him
the
river
was
stilled
at
the
flood
and
the
yellow
water
reflecting
the
sunset
glowed
in
its
deep
pools
like
dull
brass
these
burning
pools
the
level
meadows
fringed
with
shuddering
reeds
the
long
dark
sweep
of
the
forest
on
the
hill
were
all
clear
and
distinct
yet
the
light
seemed
to
have
clothed
them
with
a
new
garment
even
as
voices
from
the
streets
of
caermaen
sounded
strangely
mounting
up
thin
with
the
smoke
there
beneath
him
lay
the
huddled
cluster
of
caermaen
the
ragged
and
uneven
roofs
that
marked
the
winding
and
sordid
streets
here
and
there
a
pointed
gable
rising
above
its
meaner
fellows
beyond
he
recognized
the
piled
mounds
that
marked
the
circle
of
the
amphitheatre
and
the
dark
edge
of
trees
that
grew
where
the
roman
wall
whitened
and
waxed
old
beneath
the
frosts
and
rains
of
eighteen
hundred
years
thin
and
strange
mingled
together
the
voices
came
up
to
him
on
the
hill
it
was
as
if
an
outland
race
inhabited
the
ruined
city
and
talked
in
a
strange
language
of
strange
and
terrible
things
the
sun
had
slid
down
the
sky
and
hung
quivering
over
the
huge
dark
dome
of
the
mountain
like
a
burnt
sacrifice
and
then
suddenly
vanished
in
the
afterglow
the
clouds
began
to
writhe
and
turn
scarlet
and
shone
so
strangely
reflected
in
the
pools
of
the
river
that
one
would
have
said
the
still
waters
stirred
the
fleeting
and
changing
of
the
clouds
seeming
to
quicken
the
stream
as
if
it
bubbled
and
sent
up
gouts
of
blood
but
already
about
the
town
the
darkness
was
forming
fast
fast
the
shadows
crept
upon
it
from
the
forest
and
from
all
sides
banks
and
wreaths
of
curling
mist
were
gathering
as
if
a
ghostly
leaguer
were
being
built
up
against
the
city
and
the
strange
race
who
lived
in
its
streets
suddenly
there
burst
out
from
the
stillness
the
clear
and
piercing
music
of
the
calling
recalling
iterated
reiterated
and
ending
with
one
long
high
fierce
shrill
note
with
which
the
steep
hills
rang
perhaps
a
boy
in
the
school
band
was
practicing
on
his
bugle
but
for
lucian
it
was
magic
for
him
it
was
the
note
of
the
roman
trumpet
mirum
spargens
filling
all
the
hollow
valley
with
its
command
reverberated
in
dark
places
in
the
far
forest
and
resonant
in
the
old
graveyards
without
the
walls
in
his
imagination
he
saw
the
earthen
gates
of
the
tombs
broken
open
and
the
serried
legion
swarming
to
the
eagles
century
by
century
they
passed
by
they
rose
dripping
from
the
river
bed
they
rose
from
the
level
their
armor
shone
in
the
quiet
orchard
they
gathered
in
ranks
and
companies
from
the
cemetery
and
as
the
trumpet
sounded
the
hill
fort
above
the
town
gave
up
its
dead
by
hundreds
and
thousands
the
ghostly
battle
surged
about
the
standard
behind
the
quaking
mist
ready
to
march
against
the
moldering
walls
they
had
built
so
many
years
before
he
turned
sharply
it
was
growing
very
dark
and
he
was
afraid
of
missing
his
way
at
first
the
path
led
him
by
the
verge
of
a
wood
there
was
a
noise
of
rustling
and
murmuring
from
the
trees
as
if
they
were
taking
evil
counsel
together
a
high
hedge
shut
out
the
sight
of
the
darkening
valley
and
he
stumbled
on
mechanically
without
taking
much
note
of
the
turnings
of
the
track
and
when
he
came
out
from
the
wood
shadow
to
the
open
country
he
stood
for
a
moment
quite
bewildered
and
uncertain
a
dark
wild
twilight
country
lay
before
him
confused
dim
shapes
of
trees
near
at
hand
and
a
hollow
below
his
feet
and
the
further
hills
and
woods
were
dimmer
and
all
the
air
was
very
still
suddenly
the
darkness
about
him
glowed
a
furnace
fire
had
shot
up
on
the
mountain
and
for
a
moment
the
little
world
of
the
woodside
and
the
steep
hill
shone
in
a
pale
light
and
he
thought
he
saw
his
path
beaten
out
in
the
turf
before
him
the
great
flame
sank
down
to
a
red
glint
of
fire
and
it
led
him
on
down
the
ragged
slope
his
feet
striking
against
ridges
of
ground
and
falling
from
beneath
him
at
a
sudden
dip
the
bramble
bushes
shot
out
long
prickly
vines
amongst
which
he
was
entangled
and
lower
he
was
held
back
by
wet
bubbling
earth
he
had
descended
into
a
dark
and
shady
valley
beset
and
tapestried
with
gloomy
thickets
the
weird
wood
noises
were
the
only
sounds
strange
unutterable
mutterings
dismal
inarticulate
he
pushed
on
in
what
he
hoped
was
the
right
direction
stumbling
from
stile
to
gate
peering
through
mist
and
shadow
and
still
vainly
seeking
for
any
known
landmark
presently
another
sound
broke
upon
the
grim
air
the
murmur
of
water
poured
over
stones
gurgling
against
the
old
misshapen
roots
of
trees
and
running
clear
in
a
deep
channel
he
passed
into
the
chill
breath
of
the
brook
and
almost
fancied
he
heard
two
voices
speaking
in
its
murmur
there
seemed
a
ceaseless
utterance
of
words
an
endless
argument
with
a
mood
of
horror
pressing
on
him
he
listened
to
the
noise
of
waters
and
the
wild
fancy
seized
him
that
he
was
not
deceived
that
two
unknown
beings
stood
together
there
in
the
darkness
and
tried
the
balances
of
his
life
and
spoke
his
doom
the
hour
in
the
matted
thicket
rushed
over
the
great
bridge
of
years
to
his
thought
he
had
sinned
against
the
earth
and
the
earth
trembled
and
shook
for
vengeance
he
stayed
still
for
a
moment
quivering
with
fear
and
at
last
went
on
blindly
no
longer
caring
for
the
path
if
only
he
might
escape
from
the
toils
of
that
dismal
shuddering
hollow
as
he
plunged
through
the
hedges
the
bristling
thorns
tore
his
face
and
hands
he
fell
amongst
and
was
pricked
as
he
beat
out
his
way
amidst
the
gorse
he
raced
headlong
his
head
over
his
shoulder
through
a
windy
wood
bare
of
undergrowth
there
lay
about
the
ground
moldering
stumps
the
relics
of
trees
that
had
thundered
to
their
fall
crashing
and
tearing
to
earth
long
ago
and
from
these
remains
there
flowed
out
a
pale
thin
radiance
filling
the
spaces
of
the
sounding
wood
with
a
dream
of
light
he
had
lost
all
count
of
the
track
he
felt
he
had
fled
for
hours
climbing
and
descending
and
yet
not
advancing
it
was
as
if
he
stood
still
and
the
shadows
of
the
land
went
by
in
a
vision
but
at
last
a
hedge
high
and
straggling
rose
before
him
and
as
he
broke
through
it
his
feet
slipped
and
he
fell
headlong
down
a
steep
bank
into
a
lane
he
lay
still
for
a
moment
and
then
rising
unsteadily
he
looked
desperately
into
the
darkness
before
him
uncertain
and
bewildered
in
front
it
was
black
as
a
midnight
cellar
and
he
turned
about
and
saw
a
glint
in
the
distance
as
if
a
candle
were
flickering
in
a
window
he
began
to
walk
with
trembling
feet
towards
the
light
when
suddenly
something
pale
started
out
from
the
shadows
before
him
and
seemed
to
swim
and
float
down
the
air
he
was
going
down
hill
and
he
hastened
onwards
and
he
could
see
the
bars
of
a
stile
framed
dimly
against
the
sky
and
the
figure
still
advanced
with
that
gliding
motion
then
as
the
road
declined
to
the
valley
the
landmark
he
had
been
seeking
appeared
to
his
right
there
surged
up
in
the
darkness
the
darker
summit
of
the
roman
fort
and
the
streaming
fire
of
the
great
full
moon
glowed
through
the
bars
of
the
wizard
oaks
and
made
a
halo
shine
about
the
hill
he
was
now
quite
close
to
the
white
appearance
and
saw
that
it
was
only
a
woman
walking
swiftly
down
the
lane
the
floating
movement
was
an
effect
due
to
the
somber
air
and
the
moon
glamour
at
the
gate
where
he
had
spent
so
many
hours
gazing
at
the
fort
they
walked
foot
to
foot
and
he
saw
it
was
annie
morgan
good
evening
master
lucian
said
the
girl
it
very
dark
sir
indeed
good
evening
annie
he
answered
calling
her
by
her
name
for
the
first
time
and
he
saw
that
she
smiled
with
pleasure
you
are
out
late
you
yes
sir
but
i
been
taking
a
bit
of
supper
to
old
gibbon
been
very
poorly
the
last
few
days
and
there
nobody
to
do
anything
for
her
then
there
were
really
people
who
helped
one
another
kindness
and
pity
were
not
mere
myths
fictions
of
society
as
useful
as
doe
and
roe
and
as
the
thought
struck
lucian
with
a
shock
the
passion
and
delirium
the
wild
walk
and
physical
fatigue
had
almost
shattered
him
in
body
and
mind
he
was
degenerate
and
the
rough
rains
and
blustering
winds
of
life
which
a
stronger
man
would
have
laughed
at
and
enjoyed
were
to
him
and
after
all
messrs
beit
the
publishers
were
only
sharp
men
of
business
and
these
terrible
dixons
and
gervases
and
colleys
merely
the
ordinary
limited
clergy
and
gentry
of
a
quiet
country
town
sturdier
sense
would
have
dismissed
dixon
as
an
old
humbug
stanley
gervase
esquire
as
a
bit
of
a
bounder
and
the
ladies
as
rather
a
shoddy
lot
but
he
was
walking
slowly
now
in
painful
silence
his
heavy
lagging
feet
striking
against
the
loose
stones
he
was
not
thinking
of
the
girl
beside
him
only
something
seemed
to
swell
and
grow
and
swell
within
his
heart
it
was
all
the
torture
of
his
days
weary
hopes
and
weary
disappointment
scorn
rankling
and
throbbing
and
the
thought
i
had
rather
call
the
devils
my
brothers
and
live
with
them
in
hell
he
choked
and
gasped
for
breath
and
felt
involuntary
muscles
working
in
his
face
and
the
impulses
of
a
madman
stirring
him
he
himself
was
in
truth
the
realization
of
the
vision
of
caermaen
that
night
a
city
with
moldering
walls
beset
by
the
ghostly
legion
life
and
the
world
and
the
laws
of
the
sunlight
had
passed
away
and
the
resurrection
and
kingdom
of
the
dead
began
the
celt
assailed
him
becoming
from
the
weird
wood
he
called
the
world
and
his
ancestors
the
little
people
crept
out
of
their
caves
muttering
charms
and
incantations
in
hissing
inhuman
speech
he
was
beleaguered
by
desires
that
had
slept
in
his
race
for
ages
i
am
afraid
you
are
very
tired
master
lucian
would
you
like
me
to
give
you
my
hand
over
this
rough
bit
he
had
stumbled
against
a
great
round
stone
and
had
nearly
fallen
the
woman
hand
sought
his
in
the
darkness
as
he
felt
the
touch
of
the
soft
warm
flesh
he
moaned
and
a
pang
shot
through
his
arm
to
his
heart
he
looked
up
and
found
he
had
only
walked
a
few
paces
since
annie
had
spoken
he
had
thought
they
had
wandered
for
hours
together
the
moon
was
just
mounting
above
the
oaks
and
the
halo
round
the
dark
hill
brightened
he
stopped
short
and
keeping
his
hold
of
annie
hand
looked
into
her
face
a
hazy
glory
of
moonlight
shone
around
them
and
lit
up
their
eyes
he
had
not
greatly
altered
since
his
boyhood
his
face
was
pale
olive
in
color
thin
and
oval
marks
of
pain
had
gathered
about
the
eyes
and
his
black
hair
was
already
stricken
with
grey
but
the
eager
curious
gaze
still
remained
and
what
he
saw
before
him
lit
up
his
sadness
with
a
new
fire
she
stopped
too
and
did
not
offer
to
draw
away
but
looked
back
with
all
her
heart
they
were
alike
in
many
ways
her
skin
was
also
of
that
olive
color
but
her
face
was
sweet
as
a
beautiful
summer
night
and
her
black
eyes
showed
no
dimness
and
the
smile
on
the
scarlet
lips
was
like
a
flame
when
it
brightens
a
dark
and
lonely
land
you
are
sorely
tired
master
lucian
let
us
sit
down
here
by
the
gate
it
was
lucian
who
spoke
next
my
dear
my
dear
and
their
lips
were
together
again
and
their
arms
locked
together
each
holding
the
other
fast
and
then
the
poor
lad
let
his
head
sink
down
on
his
breast
and
burst
into
a
passion
of
weeping
the
tears
streamed
down
his
face
and
he
shook
with
sobbing
in
the
happiest
moment
that
he
had
ever
lived
the
woman
bent
over
him
and
tried
to
comfort
him
but
his
tears
were
his
consolation
and
his
triumph
annie
was
whispering
to
him
her
hand
laid
on
his
heart
she
was
whispering
beautiful
wonderful
words
that
soothed
him
as
a
song
he
did
not
know
what
they
meant
annie
dear
dear
annie
what
are
you
saying
to
me
i
have
never
heard
such
beautiful
words
tell
me
annie
what
do
they
mean
she
laughed
and
said
it
was
only
nonsense
that
the
nurses
sang
to
the
children
no
no
you
are
not
to
call
me
master
lucian
any
more
he
said
when
they
parted
you
must
call
me
lucian
and
i
i
worship
you
my
dear
annie
he
fell
down
before
her
embracing
her
knees
and
adored
and
she
allowed
him
and
confirmed
his
worship
he
followed
slowly
after
her
passing
the
path
which
led
to
her
home
with
a
longing
glance
nobody
saw
any
difference
in
lucian
when
he
reached
the
rectory
he
came
in
with
his
usual
dreamy
indifference
and
told
how
he
had
lost
his
way
by
trying
the
short
cut
he
said
he
had
met
burrows
on
the
road
and
that
he
had
recommended
the
path
by
the
fields
then
as
dully
as
if
he
had
been
reading
some
story
out
of
a
newspaper
he
gave
his
father
the
outlines
of
the
beit
case
producing
the
pretty
little
book
called
chorus
in
the
parson
listened
in
amazement
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
wrote
this
book
he
said
he
was
quite
roused
no
not
all
of
it
look
that
bit
is
mine
and
that
and
the
beginning
of
this
chapter
nearly
the
whole
of
the
third
chapter
is
by
me
he
closed
the
book
without
interest
and
indeed
he
felt
astonished
at
his
father
excitement
the
incident
seemed
to
him
unimportant
and
you
say
that
eighty
or
ninety
pages
of
this
book
are
yours
and
these
scoundrels
have
stolen
your
work
well
i
suppose
they
have
i
fetch
the
manuscript
if
you
would
like
to
look
at
it
the
manuscript
was
duly
produced
wrapped
in
brown
paper
with
messrs
beit
address
label
on
it
and
the
dated
stamps
and
the
other
book
has
been
out
a
month
the
parson
forgetting
the
sacerdotal
office
and
his
good
habit
of
grinning
swore
at
messrs
beit
and
ritson
calling
them
damned
thieves
and
then
began
to
read
the
manuscript
and
to
compare
it
with
the
printed
book
why
it
splendid
work
my
poor
fellow
he
said
after
a
while
i
had
no
notion
you
could
write
so
well
i
used
to
think
of
such
things
in
the
old
days
at
oxford
bill
the
tutor
used
to
praise
my
essays
but
i
never
wrote
anything
like
this
and
this
infernal
ruffian
of
a
ritson
has
taken
all
your
best
things
and
mixed
them
up
with
his
own
rot
to
make
it
go
down
of
course
you
expose
the
gang
lucian
was
mildly
amused
he
could
enter
into
his
father
feelings
at
all
he
sat
smoking
in
one
of
the
old
easy
chairs
taking
the
rare
relish
of
a
hot
grog
with
his
pipe
and
gazing
out
of
his
dreamy
eyes
at
the
violent
old
parson
he
was
pleased
that
his
father
liked
his
book
because
he
knew
him
to
be
a
deep
and
sober
scholar
and
a
cool
judge
of
good
letters
but
he
laughed
to
himself
when
he
saw
the
magic
of
print
the
parson
had
expressed
no
wish
to
read
the
manuscript
when
it
came
back
in
disgrace
he
had
merely
grinned
said
something
about
boomerangs
and
quoted
horace
with
relish
whereas
now
before
the
book
in
its
neat
case
lettered
with
another
man
name
his
approbation
of
the
writing
and
his
disapproval
of
the
scoundrels
as
he
called
them
were
loudly
expressed
and
though
a
good
smoker
he
blew
and
puffed
vehemently
at
his
pipe
you
expose
the
rascals
of
course
wo
you
he
said
again
oh
no
i
think
not
it
really
does
matter
much
does
it
after
all
there
are
some
very
weak
things
in
the
book
does
it
strike
you
as
i
have
been
thinking
of
another
plan
but
i
have
done
much
with
it
lately
but
i
believe
i
got
hold
of
a
really
good
idea
this
time
and
if
i
can
manage
to
see
the
heart
of
it
i
hope
to
turn
out
a
manuscript
worth
stealing
but
it
so
hard
to
get
at
the
core
of
an
idea
the
heart
as
i
call
it
he
went
on
after
a
pause
it
like
having
a
box
you
ca
open
though
you
know
there
something
wonderful
inside
but
i
do
believe
i
a
fine
thing
in
my
hands
and
i
mean
to
try
my
best
to
work
it
lucian
talked
with
enthusiasm
now
but
his
father
on
his
side
could
not
share
these
ardors
it
was
his
part
to
be
astonished
at
excitement
over
a
book
that
was
not
even
begun
the
mere
ghost
of
a
book
flitting
elusive
in
the
world
of
unborn
masterpieces
and
failures
he
had
loved
good
letters
but
he
shared
unconsciously
in
the
general
belief
that
literary
attempt
is
always
pitiful
though
he
did
not
subscribe
to
the
other
half
of
the
popular
faith
that
literary
success
is
a
matter
of
very
little
importance
he
thought
well
of
books
but
only
of
printed
books
in
manuscripts
he
put
no
faith
and
the
tense
he
could
not
in
any
manner
conjugate
he
returned
once
more
to
the
topic
of
palpable
interest
but
about
this
dirty
trick
these
fellows
have
played
on
you
you
sit
quietly
and
bear
it
surely
it
only
a
question
of
writing
to
the
papers
they
would
put
the
letter
in
and
if
they
did
i
should
only
get
laughed
at
some
time
ago
a
man
wrote
to
the
complaining
of
his
play
being
stolen
he
said
that
he
had
sent
a
little
comedy
to
burleigh
the
great
dramatist
asking
for
his
advice
burleigh
gave
his
advice
and
took
the
idea
for
his
own
very
successful
play
so
the
man
said
and
i
daresay
it
was
true
enough
but
the
victim
got
nothing
by
his
complaint
pretty
state
of
things
everybody
said
a
tomson
that
no
one
has
ever
heard
of
bothers
burleigh
with
his
rubbish
and
then
accuses
him
of
petty
larceny
is
it
likely
that
a
man
of
burleigh
position
a
playwright
who
can
make
his
five
thousand
a
year
easily
would
borrow
from
an
unknown
tomson
i
should
think
it
very
likely
indeed
lucian
went
on
chuckling
but
that
was
their
verdict
no
i
do
think
i
write
to
the
papers
well
well
my
boy
i
suppose
you
know
your
own
business
best
i
think
you
are
mistaken
but
you
must
do
as
you
like
it
all
so
unimportant
said
lucian
and
he
really
thought
so
he
had
sweeter
things
to
dream
of
and
desired
no
communion
of
feeling
with
that
madman
who
had
left
caermaen
some
few
hours
before
he
felt
he
had
made
a
fool
of
himself
he
was
ashamed
to
think
of
the
fatuity
of
which
he
had
been
guilty
such
boiling
hatred
was
not
only
wicked
but
absurd
a
man
could
do
no
good
who
put
himself
into
a
position
of
such
violent
antagonism
against
his
so
lucian
rebuked
his
heart
saying
that
he
was
old
enough
to
know
better
but
he
remembered
that
he
had
sweeter
things
to
dream
of
there
was
a
secret
ecstasy
that
he
treasured
and
locked
tight
away
as
a
joy
too
exquisite
even
for
thought
till
he
was
quite
alone
and
then
there
was
that
scheme
for
a
new
book
that
he
had
laid
down
hopelessly
some
time
ago
it
seemed
to
have
arisen
into
life
again
within
the
last
hour
he
understood
that
he
had
started
on
a
false
tack
he
had
taken
the
wrong
aspect
of
his
idea
of
course
the
thing
could
be
written
in
that
way
it
was
like
trying
to
read
a
page
turned
upside
down
and
he
saw
those
characters
he
had
vainly
sought
suddenly
disambushed
and
a
splendid
inevitable
sequence
of
events
unrolled
before
him
it
was
a
true
resurrection
the
dry
plot
he
had
constructed
revealed
itself
as
a
living
thing
stirring
and
mysterious
and
warm
as
life
itself
the
parson
was
smoking
stolidly
to
all
appearance
but
in
reality
he
was
full
of
amazement
at
his
own
son
and
now
and
again
he
slipped
sly
furtive
glances
towards
the
tranquil
young
man
in
the
by
the
empty
hearth
in
the
first
place
taylor
was
genuinely
impressed
by
what
he
had
read
of
lucian
work
he
had
so
long
been
accustomed
to
look
upon
all
effort
as
futile
that
success
amazed
him
in
the
abstract
of
course
he
was
prepared
to
admit
that
some
people
did
write
well
and
got
published
and
made
money
just
as
other
persons
successfully
backed
an
outsider
at
heavy
odds
but
it
had
seemed
as
improbable
that
lucian
should
show
even
the
beginnings
of
achievement
in
one
direction
as
in
the
other
then
the
boy
evidently
cared
so
little
about
it
he
did
not
appear
to
be
proud
of
being
worth
robbing
nor
was
he
angry
with
the
robbers
he
sat
back
luxuriously
in
the
disreputable
old
chair
drawing
long
slow
wreaths
of
smoke
tasting
his
whisky
from
time
to
time
evidently
well
at
ease
with
himself
the
father
saw
him
smile
and
it
suddenly
dawned
upon
him
that
his
son
was
very
handsome
he
had
such
kind
gentle
eyes
and
a
kind
mouth
and
his
pale
cheeks
were
flushed
like
a
girl
taylor
felt
moved
what
a
harmless
young
fellow
lucian
had
been
no
doubt
a
little
queer
and
different
from
others
but
wholly
inoffensive
and
patient
under
disappointment
and
miss
deacon
her
contribution
to
the
evening
discussion
had
been
characteristic
she
had
remarked
firstly
that
writing
was
a
very
unsettling
occupation
and
secondly
that
it
was
extremely
foolish
to
entrust
one
property
to
people
of
whom
one
knew
nothing
father
and
son
had
smiled
together
at
these
observations
which
were
probably
true
enough
taylor
at
last
left
lucian
along
he
shook
hands
with
a
good
deal
of
respect
and
said
almost
deferentially
you
must
work
too
hard
old
fellow
i
would
stay
up
too
late
if
i
were
you
after
that
long
walk
you
must
have
gone
miles
out
of
your
way
i
not
tired
now
though
i
feel
as
if
i
could
write
my
new
book
on
the
spot
and
the
young
man
laughed
a
gay
sweet
laugh
that
struck
the
father
as
a
new
note
in
his
son
life
he
sat
still
a
moment
after
his
father
had
left
the
room
he
cherished
his
chief
treasure
of
thought
in
its
secret
place
he
would
not
enjoy
it
yet
he
drew
up
a
chair
to
the
table
at
which
he
wrote
or
tried
to
write
and
began
taking
pens
and
paper
from
the
drawer
there
was
a
great
pile
of
ruled
paper
there
all
of
it
used
on
one
side
and
signifying
many
hours
of
desperate
scribbling
of
and
rack
of
his
brain
an
array
of
poor
eager
lines
written
by
a
waning
fire
with
waning
hope
all
useless
and
abandoned
he
took
up
the
sheets
cheerfully
and
began
in
delicious
idleness
to
look
over
these
fruitless
efforts
a
page
caught
his
attention
he
remembered
how
he
wrote
it
while
a
november
storm
was
dashing
against
the
panes
and
there
was
another
with
a
queer
blot
in
one
corner
he
had
got
up
from
his
chair
and
looked
out
and
all
the
earth
was
white
fairyland
and
the
snowflakes
whirled
round
and
round
in
the
wind
then
he
saw
the
chapter
begun
of
a
night
in
march
a
great
gale
blew
that
night
and
rooted
up
one
of
the
ancient
yews
in
the
churchyard
he
had
heard
the
trees
shrieking
in
the
woods
and
the
long
wail
of
the
wind
and
across
the
heaven
a
white
moon
fled
awfully
before
the
streaming
clouds
and
all
these
poor
abandoned
pages
now
seemed
sweet
and
past
unhappiness
was
transmuted
into
happiness
and
the
nights
of
toil
were
holy
he
turned
over
half
a
dozen
leaves
and
began
to
sketch
out
the
outlines
of
the
new
book
on
the
unused
pages
running
out
a
skeleton
plan
on
one
page
and
dotting
fancies
suggestions
hints
on
others
he
wrote
rapidly
overjoyed
to
find
that
loving
phrases
grew
under
his
pen
a
particular
scene
he
had
imagined
filled
him
with
desire
he
gave
his
hand
free
course
and
saw
the
written
work
glowing
and
action
and
all
the
heat
of
existence
quickened
and
beat
on
the
wet
page
happy
fancies
took
shape
in
happier
words
and
when
at
last
he
leant
back
in
his
chair
he
felt
the
stir
and
rush
of
the
story
as
if
it
had
been
some
portion
of
his
own
life
he
read
over
what
he
had
done
with
a
renewed
pleasure
in
the
nimble
and
flowing
workmanship
and
as
he
put
the
little
pile
of
manuscript
tenderly
in
the
drawer
he
paused
to
enjoy
the
anticipation
of
tomorrow
labor
and
then
but
the
rest
of
the
night
was
given
to
tender
and
delicious
things
and
when
he
went
up
to
bed
a
scarlet
dawn
was
streaming
from
the
east
iii
for
days
lucian
lay
in
a
swoon
of
pleasure
smiling
when
he
was
addressed
sauntering
happily
in
the
sunlight
hugging
recollection
warm
to
his
heart
annie
had
told
him
that
she
was
going
on
a
visit
to
her
married
sister
and
said
with
a
caress
that
he
must
be
patient
he
protested
against
her
absence
but
she
fondled
him
whispering
her
charms
in
his
ear
till
he
gave
in
and
then
they
said
lucian
adoring
on
his
knees
the
parting
was
as
strange
as
the
meeting
and
that
night
when
he
laid
his
work
aside
and
let
himself
sink
deep
into
the
joys
of
memory
all
the
encounter
seemed
as
wonderful
and
impossible
as
magic
and
you
really
do
mean
to
do
anything
about
those
rascals
said
his
father
rascals
which
rascals
oh
you
mean
beit
i
had
forgotten
all
about
it
no
i
do
think
i
shall
trouble
they
not
worth
powder
and
shot
and
he
returned
to
his
dream
pacing
slowly
from
the
medlar
to
the
quince
and
back
again
it
seemed
trivial
to
be
interrupted
by
such
questions
he
had
not
even
time
to
think
of
the
book
he
had
recommenced
so
eagerly
much
less
of
this
labor
of
long
ago
he
recollected
without
interest
that
it
cost
him
many
pains
that
it
was
pretty
good
here
and
there
and
that
it
had
been
stolen
and
it
seemed
that
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
on
the
matter
he
wished
to
think
of
the
darkness
in
the
lane
of
the
kind
voice
that
spoke
to
him
of
the
kind
hand
that
sought
his
own
as
he
stumbled
on
the
rough
way
so
far
it
was
wonderful
since
he
had
left
school
and
lost
the
company
of
the
worthy
barbarians
who
had
befriended
him
there
he
had
almost
lost
the
sense
of
kinship
with
humanity
he
had
come
to
dread
the
human
form
as
men
dread
the
hood
of
the
cobra
to
lucian
a
man
or
a
woman
meant
something
that
stung
that
spoke
words
that
rankled
and
poisoned
his
life
with
scorn
at
first
such
malignity
shocked
him
he
would
ponder
over
words
and
glances
and
wonder
if
he
were
not
mistaken
and
he
still
sought
now
and
then
for
sympathy
the
poor
boy
had
romantic
ideas
about
women
he
believed
they
were
merciful
and
pitiful
very
kind
to
the
unlucky
and
helpless
men
perhaps
had
to
be
different
after
all
the
duty
of
a
man
was
to
get
on
in
the
world
or
in
plain
language
to
make
money
to
be
successful
to
cheat
rather
than
to
be
cheated
but
always
to
be
successful
and
he
could
understand
that
one
who
fell
below
this
high
standard
must
expect
to
be
severely
judged
by
his
fellows
for
example
there
was
young
bennett
miss
nephew
lucian
had
met
him
once
or
twice
when
he
was
spending
his
holidays
with
miss
spurry
and
the
two
young
fellows
compared
literary
notes
together
bennett
showed
some
beautiful
things
he
had
written
over
which
lucian
had
grown
both
sad
and
enthusiastic
it
was
such
exquisite
magic
verse
and
so
much
better
than
anything
he
ever
hoped
to
write
that
there
was
a
touch
of
anguish
in
his
congratulations
but
when
bennett
after
many
vain
prayers
to
his
aunt
threw
up
a
safe
position
in
the
bank
and
betook
himself
to
a
london
garret
lucian
was
not
surprised
at
the
general
verdict
dixon
as
a
clergyman
viewed
the
question
from
a
high
standpoint
and
found
it
all
deplorable
but
the
general
opinion
was
that
bennett
was
a
hopeless
young
lunatic
old
gervase
went
purple
when
his
name
was
mentioned
and
the
young
dixons
sneered
very
merrily
over
the
adventure
i
always
thought
he
was
a
beastly
young
ass
said
edward
dixon
but
i
did
think
he
chuck
away
his
chances
like
that
said
he
stand
a
bank
i
hope
he
be
able
to
stand
bread
and
water
that
all
those
littery
fellows
get
i
believe
except
tennyson
and
mark
twain
and
those
sort
of
people
lucian
of
course
sympathized
with
the
unfortunate
bennett
but
such
judgments
were
after
all
only
natural
the
young
man
might
have
stayed
in
the
bank
and
succeeded
to
his
aunt
thousand
a
year
and
everybody
would
have
called
him
a
very
nice
young
fellow
clever
too
but
he
had
deliberately
chosen
as
edward
dixon
had
said
to
chuck
his
chances
away
for
the
sake
of
literature
piety
and
a
sense
of
the
main
chance
had
alike
pointed
the
way
to
a
delicate
course
of
wheedling
to
a
little
harmless
practicing
on
miss
spurry
infirmities
to
frequent
compliances
of
a
soothing
nature
and
the
young
ass
had
been
blind
to
the
direction
of
one
and
the
other
it
seemed
almost
right
that
the
vicar
should
moralize
that
edward
dixon
should
sneer
and
that
gervase
should
grow
purple
with
contempt
men
lucian
thought
were
like
judges
who
may
pity
the
criminal
in
their
hearts
but
are
forced
to
vindicate
the
outraged
majesty
of
the
law
by
a
severe
sentence
he
felt
the
same
considerations
applied
to
his
own
case
he
knew
that
his
father
should
have
had
more
money
that
his
clothes
should
be
newer
and
of
a
better
cut
that
he
should
have
gone
to
the
university
and
made
good
friends
if
such
had
been
his
fortune
he
could
have
looked
his
proudly
in
the
face
upright
and
unashamed
having
put
on
the
whole
armor
of
a
west
end
tailor
with
money
in
his
purse
having
taken
anxious
thought
for
the
morrow
and
having
some
useful
friends
and
good
prospects
in
such
a
case
he
might
have
held
his
head
high
in
a
gentlemanly
and
christian
community
as
it
was
he
had
usually
avoided
the
reproachful
glance
of
his
fellows
feeling
that
he
deserved
their
condemnation
but
he
had
cherished
for
a
long
time
his
romantic
sentimentalities
about
women
literary
conventions
borrowed
from
the
minor
poets
and
or
so
he
thought
afterwards
but
fresh
from
school
wearied
a
little
with
the
perpetual
society
of
barbarian
though
worthy
boys
he
had
in
his
soul
a
charming
image
of
womanhood
before
which
he
worshipped
with
mingled
passion
and
devotion
it
was
a
nude
figure
perhaps
but
the
shining
arms
were
to
be
wound
about
the
neck
of
a
vanquished
knight
there
was
rest
for
the
head
of
a
wounded
lover
the
hands
were
stretched
forth
to
do
works
of
pity
and
the
smiling
lips
were
to
murmur
not
love
alone
but
consolation
in
defeat
here
was
the
refuge
for
a
broken
heart
here
the
scorn
of
men
would
but
make
tenderness
increase
here
was
all
pity
and
all
charity
with
it
was
a
delightful
picture
conceived
in
the
come
rest
on
this
bosom
and
a
ministering
angel
thou
manner
with
touches
of
allurement
that
made
devotion
all
the
sweeter
he
soon
found
that
he
had
idealized
a
little
in
the
affair
of
young
bennett
while
the
men
were
contemptuous
the
women
were
virulent
he
had
been
rather
fond
of
agatha
gervase
and
she
so
other
ladies
said
had
set
her
cap
at
him
now
when
he
rebelled
and
lost
the
goodwill
of
his
aunt
dear
miss
spurry
agatha
insulted
him
with
all
conceivable
rapidity
after
all
bennett
she
said
you
will
be
nothing
better
than
a
beggar
now
will
you
you
must
think
me
cruel
but
i
ca
help
speaking
the
truth
books
her
expression
filled
up
the
incomplete
sentence
she
waggled
with
indignant
emotion
these
passages
came
to
lucian
ears
and
indeed
the
gervases
boasted
of
how
well
poor
agatha
had
behaved
never
mind
gathy
old
gervase
had
observed
if
the
impudent
young
puppy
comes
here
again
we
see
what
thomas
can
do
with
the
poor
dear
child
gervase
added
in
telling
the
tale
and
she
was
so
fond
of
him
too
but
of
course
it
could
go
on
after
his
shameful
behavior
but
lucian
was
troubled
he
sought
vainly
for
the
ideal
womanly
the
tender
note
of
come
rest
on
this
bosom
ministering
angels
he
felt
convinced
do
not
rub
red
pepper
and
sulfuric
acid
into
the
wounds
of
suffering
mortals
then
there
was
the
case
of
vaughan
a
squire
in
the
neighborhood
at
whose
board
all
the
aristocracy
of
caermaen
had
feasted
for
years
vaughan
had
a
cook
and
his
cellar
was
rare
and
he
was
never
so
happy
as
when
he
shared
his
good
things
with
his
friends
his
mother
kept
his
house
and
they
delighted
all
the
girls
with
frequent
dances
while
the
men
sighed
over
the
amazing
champagne
investments
proved
disastrous
and
vaughan
had
to
sell
the
grey
by
the
river
he
and
his
mother
took
a
little
modern
stucco
villa
in
caermaen
wishing
to
be
near
their
dear
friends
but
the
men
were
very
sorry
rough
on
you
vaughan
always
thought
those
patagonians
were
risky
but
you
would
hear
of
it
hope
we
shall
see
you
before
very
long
you
and
vaughan
must
come
to
tea
some
day
after
christmas
of
course
we
are
all
very
sorry
for
them
said
henrietta
dixon
no
we
have
called
on
vaughan
yet
they
have
no
regular
servant
you
know
only
a
woman
in
the
morning
i
hear
old
mother
vaughan
as
edward
will
call
her
does
nearly
everything
and
their
house
is
absurdly
small
it
little
more
than
a
cottage
one
really
ca
call
it
a
house
then
vaughan
his
heart
in
the
dust
went
to
the
gervases
and
tried
to
borrow
five
pounds
of
gervase
he
had
to
be
ordered
out
of
the
house
and
as
edith
gervase
said
it
was
all
very
painful
he
went
out
in
such
a
funny
way
she
added
just
like
the
dog
when
he
had
a
whipping
of
course
it
sad
even
if
it
is
all
his
own
fault
as
everybody
says
but
he
looked
so
ridiculous
as
he
was
going
down
the
steps
that
i
help
laughing
vaughan
heard
the
ringing
youthful
laughter
as
he
crossed
the
lawn
young
girls
like
henrietta
dixon
and
edith
gervase
naturally
viewed
the
vaughans
comical
position
with
all
the
high
spirits
of
their
age
but
the
elder
ladies
could
not
look
at
matters
in
this
frivolous
light
hush
dear
hush
said
gervase
it
all
too
shocking
to
be
a
laughing
matter
do
you
agree
with
me
dixon
the
sinful
extravagance
that
went
on
at
pentre
always
me
you
remember
that
ball
they
gave
last
year
gervase
assured
me
that
the
champagne
must
have
cost
a
hundred
and
fifty
shillings
the
dozen
it
dreadful
is
it
said
dixon
when
one
thinks
of
how
many
poor
people
there
are
who
would
be
thankful
for
a
crust
of
bread
yes
dixon
agatha
joined
in
and
you
know
how
absurdly
the
vaughans
spoilt
the
cottagers
oh
it
was
really
wicked
one
would
think
vaughan
wished
to
make
them
above
their
station
edith
and
i
went
for
a
walk
one
day
nearly
as
far
as
pentre
and
we
begged
a
glass
of
water
of
old
jones
who
lives
in
that
pretty
cottage
near
the
brook
she
began
praising
the
vaughans
in
the
most
fulsome
manner
and
showed
us
some
flannel
things
they
had
given
her
at
christmas
i
assure
you
my
dear
dixon
the
flannel
was
the
very
best
quality
no
lady
could
wish
for
better
it
could
have
cost
less
than
a
yard
i
know
my
dear
i
know
dixon
always
said
it
could
last
how
often
i
have
heard
him
say
that
the
vaughans
were
pauperizing
all
the
common
people
about
pentre
and
putting
every
one
else
in
a
most
unpleasant
position
even
from
a
worldly
point
of
view
it
was
very
poor
taste
on
their
part
so
different
from
the
charity
that
paul
speaks
of
i
only
wish
they
had
given
away
nothing
worse
than
flannel
said
miss
colley
a
young
lady
of
very
strict
views
but
i
assure
you
there
was
a
perfect
orgy
i
can
call
it
nothing
else
every
christmas
great
joints
of
prime
beef
and
barrels
of
strong
beer
and
snuff
and
tobacco
distributed
wholesale
as
if
the
poor
wanted
to
be
encouraged
in
their
disgusting
habits
it
was
really
impossible
to
go
through
the
village
for
weeks
after
the
whole
place
was
poisoned
with
the
fumes
of
horrid
tobacco
pipes
well
we
see
how
that
sort
of
thing
ends
said
dixon
summing
up
judicially
we
had
intended
to
call
but
i
really
think
it
would
be
impossible
after
what
gervase
has
told
us
the
idea
of
vaughan
trying
to
sponge
on
poor
gervase
in
that
shabby
way
i
think
meanness
of
that
kind
is
so
hateful
it
was
the
practical
side
of
all
this
that
astonished
lucian
he
saw
that
in
reality
there
was
no
quixotism
in
a
woman
nature
the
smooth
arms
made
he
had
thought
for
caressing
seemed
muscular
the
hands
meant
for
the
doing
of
works
of
pity
in
his
system
appeared
dexterous
in
the
giving
of
stingers
as
barnes
might
say
and
the
smiling
lips
could
sneer
with
great
ease
nor
was
he
more
fortunate
in
his
personal
experiences
as
has
been
told
dixon
spoke
of
him
in
connection
with
judgments
and
the
younger
ladies
did
not
exactly
cultivate
his
acquaintance
theoretically
they
adored
books
and
thought
poetry
too
sweet
but
in
practice
they
preferred
talking
about
mares
and
and
their
neighbors
they
were
nice
girls
enough
very
like
other
young
ladies
in
other
country
towns
content
with
the
teaching
of
their
parents
reading
the
bible
every
morning
in
their
bedrooms
and
sitting
every
sunday
in
church
amongst
the
sheep
on
the
right
hand
it
was
not
their
fault
if
they
failed
to
satisfy
the
ideal
of
an
enthusiastic
dreamy
boy
and
indeed
they
would
have
thought
his
feigned
woman
immodest
absurdly
sentimental
a
fright
never
wears
stays
my
dear
and
at
first
he
was
a
good
deal
grieved
at
the
loss
of
that
charming
tender
woman
the
work
of
his
brain
when
the
miss
dixons
went
haughtily
by
with
a
scornful
waggle
when
the
miss
gervases
passed
in
the
wagonette
laughing
as
the
mud
splashed
him
the
poor
fellow
would
look
up
with
a
face
of
grief
that
must
have
been
very
comic
like
a
dying
duck
as
edith
gervase
said
edith
was
really
very
pretty
and
he
would
have
liked
to
talk
to
her
even
about
if
she
would
have
listened
one
afternoon
at
the
dixons
he
really
forced
himself
upon
her
and
with
all
the
obtuseness
of
an
enthusiastic
boy
tried
to
discuss
the
of
tennyson
it
was
too
absurd
captain
kempton
was
making
signals
to
edith
all
the
time
and
lieutenant
gatwick
had
gone
off
in
disgust
and
he
had
promised
to
bring
her
a
puppy
by
vick
out
of
wasp
at
last
the
poor
girl
could
bear
it
no
longer
yes
it
very
sweet
she
said
at
last
when
did
you
say
you
were
going
to
london
mr
taylor
it
was
about
the
time
that
his
disappointment
became
known
to
everybody
and
the
shot
told
he
gave
her
a
piteous
look
and
slunk
off
just
like
the
dog
when
he
had
a
whipping
to
use
edith
own
expression
two
or
three
lessons
of
this
description
produced
their
due
effect
and
when
he
saw
a
male
dixon
or
gervase
approaching
him
he
bit
his
lip
and
summoned
up
his
courage
but
when
he
descried
a
ministering
angel
he
made
haste
and
hid
behind
a
hedge
or
took
to
the
woods
in
course
of
time
the
desire
to
escape
became
an
instinct
to
be
followed
as
a
matter
of
course
in
the
same
way
he
avoided
the
adders
on
the
mountain
his
old
ideals
were
almost
if
not
quite
forgotten
he
knew
that
the
female
of
the
like
the
adder
would
in
all
probability
sting
and
he
therefore
shrank
from
its
trail
but
without
any
feeling
of
special
resentment
the
one
had
a
poisoned
tongue
as
the
other
had
a
poisoned
fang
and
it
was
well
to
leave
them
both
alone
then
had
come
that
sudden
fury
of
rage
against
all
humanity
as
he
went
out
of
caermaen
carrying
the
book
that
had
been
stolen
from
him
by
the
enterprising
beit
he
shuddered
as
he
though
of
how
nearly
he
had
approached
the
verge
of
madness
when
his
eyes
filled
with
blood
and
the
earth
seemed
to
burn
with
fire
he
remembered
how
he
had
looked
up
to
the
horizon
and
the
sky
was
blotched
with
scarlet
and
the
earth
was
deep
red
with
red
woods
and
red
fields
there
was
something
of
horror
in
the
memory
and
in
the
vision
of
that
wild
night
walk
through
dim
country
when
every
shadow
seemed
a
symbol
of
some
terrible
impending
doom
the
murmur
of
the
brook
the
wind
shrilling
through
the
wood
the
pale
light
flowing
from
the
moldered
trunks
and
the
picture
of
his
own
figure
fleeing
and
fleeting
through
the
shades
all
these
seemed
unhappy
things
that
told
a
story
in
fatal
hieroglyphics
and
then
the
life
and
laws
of
the
sunlight
had
passed
away
and
the
resurrection
and
kingdom
of
the
dead
began
though
his
limbs
were
weary
he
had
felt
his
muscles
grow
strong
as
steel
a
woman
one
of
the
hated
race
was
beside
him
in
the
darkness
and
the
wild
beast
woke
within
him
ravening
for
blood
and
brutal
lust
all
the
raging
desires
of
the
dim
race
from
which
he
came
assailed
his
heart
the
ghosts
issued
out
from
the
weird
wood
and
from
the
caves
in
the
hills
besieging
him
as
he
had
imagined
the
spiritual
legion
besieging
caermaen
beckoning
him
to
a
hideous
battle
and
a
victory
that
he
had
never
imagined
in
his
wildest
dreams
and
then
out
of
the
darkness
the
kind
voice
spoke
again
and
the
kind
hand
was
stretched
out
to
draw
him
up
from
the
pit
it
was
sweet
to
think
of
that
which
he
had
found
at
last
the
boy
picture
incarnate
all
the
passion
and
compassion
of
his
longing
all
the
pity
and
love
and
consolation
she
that
beautiful
passionate
woman
offering
up
her
beauty
in
sacrifice
to
him
she
was
worthy
indeed
of
his
worship
he
remembered
how
his
tears
had
fallen
upon
her
breast
and
how
tenderly
she
had
soothed
him
whispering
those
wonderful
unknown
words
that
sang
to
his
heart
and
she
had
made
herself
defenseless
before
him
caressing
and
fondling
the
body
that
had
been
so
despised
he
exulted
in
the
happy
thought
that
he
had
knelt
down
on
the
ground
before
her
and
had
embraced
her
knees
and
worshipped
the
body
had
become
his
religion
he
lay
awake
at
night
looking
into
the
darkness
with
hungry
eyes
wishing
for
a
miracle
that
the
appearance
of
the
form
might
be
shaped
before
him
and
when
he
was
alone
in
quiet
places
in
the
wood
he
fell
down
again
on
his
knees
and
even
on
his
face
stretching
out
vain
hands
in
the
air
as
if
they
would
feel
her
flesh
his
father
noticed
in
those
days
that
the
inner
pocket
of
his
coat
was
stuffed
with
papers
he
would
see
lucian
walking
up
and
down
in
a
secret
shady
place
at
the
bottom
of
the
orchard
reading
from
his
sheaf
of
manuscript
replacing
the
leaves
and
again
drawing
them
out
he
would
walk
a
few
quick
steps
and
pause
as
if
enraptured
gazing
in
the
air
as
if
he
looked
through
the
shadows
of
the
world
into
some
sphere
of
glory
feigned
by
his
thought
taylor
was
almost
alarmed
at
the
sight
he
concluded
of
course
that
lucian
was
writing
a
book
in
the
first
place
there
seemed
something
immodest
in
seeing
the
operation
performed
under
one
eyes
it
was
as
if
the
of
a
beautiful
actress
were
done
on
the
stage
in
full
audience
as
if
one
saw
the
rounded
calves
fixed
in
position
the
fleshings
drawn
on
the
voluptuous
outlines
of
the
figure
produced
by
means
purely
mechanical
blushes
mantling
from
the
and
the
golden
tresses
well
secured
by
the
wigmaker
books
taylor
thought
should
swim
into
one
ken
mysteriously
they
should
appear
all
printed
and
bound
without
apparent
genesis
just
as
children
are
suddenly
told
that
they
have
a
little
sister
found
by
mamma
in
the
garden
but
lucian
was
not
only
engaged
in
composition
he
was
plainly
rapturous
enthusiastic
taylor
saw
him
throw
up
his
hands
and
bow
his
head
with
strange
gesture
the
parson
began
to
fear
that
his
son
was
like
some
of
those
mad
frenchmen
of
whom
he
had
read
young
fellows
who
had
a
sort
of
fury
of
literature
and
gave
their
whole
lives
to
it
spending
days
over
a
page
and
years
over
a
book
pursuing
art
as
englishmen
pursue
money
building
up
a
romance
as
if
it
were
a
business
now
taylor
held
firmly
by
the
theory
he
believed
that
a
man
of
letters
should
have
a
real
profession
some
solid
employment
in
life
get
something
to
do
he
would
have
liked
to
say
and
then
you
can
write
as
much
as
you
please
look
at
scott
look
at
dickens
and
trollope
and
then
there
was
the
social
point
of
view
it
might
be
right
or
it
might
be
wrong
but
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
literary
man
as
such
was
not
thought
much
of
in
english
society
taylor
knew
his
thackeray
and
he
remembered
that
old
major
pendennis
society
personified
did
not
exactly
boast
of
his
occupation
even
warrington
was
rather
ashamed
to
own
his
connection
with
journalism
and
pendennis
himself
laughed
openly
at
his
as
an
agreeable
way
of
making
money
a
useful
appendage
to
the
cultivation
of
dukes
his
true
business
in
life
this
was
the
plain
english
view
and
taylor
was
no
doubt
right
enough
in
thinking
it
good
practical
common
sense
therefore
when
he
saw
lucian
loitering
and
sauntering
musing
amorously
over
his
manuscript
exhibiting
manifest
signs
of
that
fine
fury
which
britons
have
ever
found
absurd
he
felt
grieved
at
heart
and
more
than
ever
sorry
that
he
had
not
been
able
to
send
the
boy
to
oxford
would
have
knocked
all
this
nonsense
out
of
him
he
thought
he
would
have
taken
a
double
first
like
my
poor
father
and
made
something
of
a
figure
in
the
world
however
it
ca
be
helped
the
poor
man
sighed
and
lit
his
pipe
and
walked
in
another
part
of
the
garden
but
he
was
mistaken
in
his
diagnosis
of
the
symptoms
the
book
that
lucian
had
begun
lay
unheeded
in
the
drawer
it
was
a
secret
work
that
he
was
engaged
on
and
the
manuscripts
that
he
took
out
of
that
inner
pocket
never
left
him
day
or
night
he
slept
with
them
next
to
his
heart
and
he
would
kiss
them
when
he
was
quite
alone
and
pay
them
such
devotion
as
he
would
have
paid
to
her
whom
they
symbolized
he
wrote
on
these
leaves
a
wonderful
ritual
of
praise
and
devotion
it
was
the
liturgy
of
his
religion
again
and
again
he
copied
and
recopied
this
madness
of
a
lover
dallying
all
days
over
the
choice
of
a
word
searching
for
more
exquisite
phrases
no
common
words
no
such
phrases
as
he
might
use
in
a
tale
would
suffice
the
sentences
of
worship
must
stir
and
be
quickened
they
must
glow
and
burn
and
be
decked
out
as
with
rare
work
of
jewelry
every
part
of
that
holy
and
beautiful
body
must
be
adored
he
sought
for
terms
of
extravagant
praise
he
bent
his
soul
and
mind
low
before
her
licking
the
dust
under
her
feet
abased
and
yet
rejoicing
as
a
templar
before
the
image
of
baphomet
he
exulted
more
especially
in
the
knowledge
that
there
was
nothing
of
the
conventional
or
common
in
his
ecstasy
he
was
not
the
fervent
adoring
lover
of
tennyson
poems
who
loves
with
passion
and
yet
with
a
proud
respect
with
the
love
always
of
a
gentleman
for
a
lady
annie
was
not
a
lady
the
morgans
had
farmed
their
land
for
hundreds
of
years
they
were
what
miss
gervase
and
miss
colley
and
the
rest
of
them
called
common
people
tennyson
noble
gentleman
thought
of
their
ladies
with
something
of
reticence
they
imagined
them
dressed
in
flowing
and
courtly
robes
walking
with
slow
dignity
they
dreamed
of
them
as
always
stately
the
future
mistresses
of
their
houses
mothers
of
their
heirs
such
lovers
bowed
but
not
too
low
remembering
their
own
honor
before
those
who
were
to
be
equal
companions
and
friends
as
well
as
wives
it
was
not
such
conceptions
as
these
that
he
embodied
in
the
amazing
emblems
of
his
ritual
he
was
not
he
told
himself
a
young
officer
something
in
the
city
or
a
rising
barrister
engaged
to
a
miss
dixon
or
a
miss
gervase
he
had
not
thought
of
looking
out
for
a
nice
little
house
in
a
good
residential
suburb
where
they
would
have
pleasant
society
there
were
to
be
no
consultations
about
or
jocose
whispers
from
friends
as
to
the
necessity
of
having
a
room
that
would
do
for
a
nursery
no
glad
young
thing
had
leant
on
his
arm
while
they
chose
the
suite
in
white
enamel
and
china
for
our
bedroom
the
modest
salesman
doing
his
best
to
spare
their
blushes
when
edith
gervase
married
she
would
get
mamma
to
look
out
for
two
really
good
servants
as
we
must
begin
quietly
and
mamma
would
make
sure
that
the
drains
and
everything
were
right
then
her
girl
friends
would
come
on
a
certain
solemn
day
to
see
all
her
lovely
things
two
dozen
of
everything
look
ethel
did
you
ever
see
such
ducky
frills
and
that
insertion
is
it
quite
too
sweet
my
dear
edith
you
are
a
lucky
girl
all
the
underlinen
specially
made
by
madame
lulu
what
delicious
things
i
hope
he
knows
what
a
prize
he
is
winning
oh
do
look
at
those
lovely
you
darling
how
happy
you
must
be
real
valenciennes
then
a
whisper
in
the
lady
ear
and
her
reply
oh
do
nelly
so
they
would
chirp
over
their
treasures
as
in
rabelais
they
chirped
over
their
cups
and
every
thing
would
be
done
in
due
order
till
the
when
mamma
who
had
strained
her
sinews
and
the
commandments
to
bring
the
match
about
would
weep
and
look
indignantly
at
the
unhappy
bridegroom
i
you
be
kind
to
her
robert
then
in
a
rapid
whisper
to
the
bride
mind
you
on
wyman
flushing
the
drains
when
you
come
back
servants
are
so
careless
and
dirty
too
do
let
him
go
about
by
himself
in
paris
men
are
so
one
never
knows
you
got
the
pills
and
aloud
after
these
god
bless
you
my
dear
there
were
stranger
things
written
in
the
manuscript
pages
that
lucian
cherished
sentences
that
burnt
and
glowed
like
coals
of
fire
which
hath
a
most
vehement
flame
there
were
phrases
that
stung
and
tingled
as
he
wrote
them
and
sonorous
words
poured
out
in
ecstasy
and
rapture
as
in
some
of
the
old
litanies
he
hugged
the
thought
that
a
great
part
of
what
he
had
invented
was
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
occult
page
after
page
might
have
been
read
aloud
to
the
uninitiated
without
betraying
the
inner
meaning
he
dreamed
night
and
day
over
these
symbols
he
copied
and
recopied
the
manuscript
nine
times
before
he
wrote
it
out
fairly
in
a
little
book
which
he
made
himself
of
a
skin
of
creamy
vellum
in
his
mania
for
acquirements
that
should
be
entirely
useless
he
had
gained
some
skill
in
illumination
or
limning
as
he
preferred
to
call
it
always
choosing
the
obscurer
word
as
the
obscurer
arts
first
he
set
himself
to
the
severe
practice
of
the
text
he
spent
many
hours
and
days
of
toil
in
struggling
to
fashion
the
serried
columns
of
black
letter
writing
and
rewriting
till
he
could
shape
the
massive
character
with
firm
true
hand
he
cut
his
quills
with
the
patience
of
a
monk
in
the
scriptorium
shaving
and
altering
the
nib
lightening
and
increasing
the
pressure
and
flexibility
of
the
points
till
the
pen
satisfied
him
and
gave
a
stroke
both
broad
and
even
then
he
made
experiments
in
inks
searching
for
some
medium
that
would
rival
the
glossy
black
letter
of
the
old
manuscripts
and
not
till
he
could
produce
a
fair
page
of
text
did
he
turn
to
the
more
entrancing
labor
of
the
capitals
and
borders
and
ornaments
he
mused
long
over
the
lombardic
letters
as
glorious
in
their
way
as
a
cathedral
and
trained
his
hand
to
execute
the
bold
and
flowing
lines
and
then
there
was
the
art
of
the
border
blossoming
in
fretted
splendor
all
about
the
page
his
cousin
miss
deacon
called
it
all
a
great
waste
of
time
and
his
father
thought
he
would
have
done
much
better
in
trying
to
improve
his
ordinary
handwriting
which
was
both
ugly
and
illegible
indeed
there
seemed
but
a
poor
demand
for
the
limner
art
he
sent
some
specimens
of
his
skill
to
an
artistic
firm
in
london
a
verse
of
the
maud
curiously
emblazoned
and
a
latin
hymn
with
the
notes
pricked
on
a
red
stave
the
firm
wrote
civilly
telling
him
that
his
work
though
good
was
not
what
they
wanted
and
enclosing
an
illuminated
text
we
have
great
demand
for
this
sort
of
thing
they
concluded
and
if
you
care
to
attempt
something
in
this
style
we
should
be
pleased
to
look
at
it
the
said
text
was
thou
god
seest
me
the
letter
was
of
a
degraded
form
bearing
much
the
same
relation
to
the
true
character
as
a
churchwarden
gothic
building
does
to
canterbury
cathedral
the
colours
were
varied
the
initial
was
pale
gold
the
pink
the
black
the
blue
and
the
first
letter
was
somehow
connected
with
a
bird
nest
containing
the
young
of
the
pigeon
who
were
waited
on
by
the
female
bird
what
a
pretty
text
said
miss
deacon
i
should
like
to
nail
it
up
in
my
room
why
do
you
try
to
do
something
like
that
lucian
you
might
make
something
by
it
i
sent
them
these
said
lucian
but
they
do
like
them
much
my
dear
boy
i
should
think
not
like
them
what
were
you
thinking
of
to
draw
those
queer
stiff
flowers
all
round
the
border
roses
they
look
like
roses
at
all
events
where
do
you
get
such
ideas
from
but
the
design
is
appropriate
look
at
the
words
my
dear
lucian
i
ca
read
the
words
it
such
a
queer
writing
look
how
plain
that
text
is
one
can
see
what
it
about
and
this
other
one
i
ca
make
it
out
at
all
it
a
latin
hymn
a
latin
hymn
is
it
a
protestant
hymn
i
may
be
but
ancient
and
is
quite
good
enough
for
me
this
is
the
music
i
suppose
but
my
dear
boy
there
are
only
four
lines
and
who
ever
heard
of
notes
shaped
like
that
you
have
made
some
square
and
some
why
did
you
look
in
your
poor
mother
old
music
in
the
ottoman
in
the
i
could
have
shown
you
how
to
make
the
notes
there
are
crotchets
you
know
and
quavers
miss
deacon
laid
down
the
illuminated
in
despair
she
felt
convinced
that
her
cousin
was
next
door
to
an
idiot
and
he
went
out
into
the
garden
and
raged
behind
a
hedge
he
broke
two
and
hit
an
very
hard
with
his
stick
and
then
feeling
more
calm
wondered
what
was
the
use
in
trying
to
do
anything
he
would
not
have
put
the
thought
into
words
but
in
his
heart
he
was
aggrieved
that
his
cousin
liked
the
pigeons
and
the
text
and
did
not
like
his
emblematical
roses
and
the
latin
hymn
he
knew
he
had
taken
great
pains
over
the
work
and
that
it
was
well
done
and
being
still
a
young
man
he
expected
praise
he
found
that
in
this
hard
world
there
was
a
lack
of
appreciation
a
critical
spirit
seemed
abroad
if
he
could
have
been
scientifically
observed
as
he
writhed
and
smarted
under
the
strictures
of
the
old
fool
as
he
rudely
called
his
cousin
the
spectacle
would
have
been
extremely
diverting
little
boys
sometimes
enjoy
a
very
similar
entertainment
either
with
their
tiny
fingers
or
with
mamma
nail
scissors
they
gradually
deprive
a
fly
of
its
wings
and
legs
the
odd
gyrations
and
queer
thin
buzzings
of
the
creature
as
it
spins
comically
round
and
round
never
fail
to
provide
a
fund
of
harmless
amusement
lucian
indeed
fancied
himself
a
very
individual
but
he
should
have
tried
to
imitate
the
nervous
organization
of
the
flies
which
as
mamma
says
ca
really
feel
but
now
as
he
prepared
the
vellum
leaves
he
remembered
his
art
with
joy
he
had
not
labored
to
do
beautiful
work
in
vain
he
read
over
his
manuscript
once
more
and
thought
of
the
designing
of
the
pages
he
made
sketches
on
furtive
sheets
of
paper
and
hunted
up
books
in
his
library
for
suggestions
there
were
books
about
architecture
and
medieval
iron
work
and
brasses
which
contributed
hints
for
adornment
and
not
content
with
mere
pictures
he
sought
in
the
woods
and
hedges
scanning
the
strange
forms
of
trees
and
the
poisonous
growth
of
great
and
the
parasite
twining
of
honeysuckle
and
briony
in
one
of
these
rambles
he
discovered
a
red
earth
which
he
made
into
a
pigment
and
he
found
in
the
unctuous
juice
of
a
certain
fern
an
ingredient
which
he
thought
made
his
black
ink
still
more
glossy
his
book
was
written
all
in
symbols
and
in
the
same
spirit
of
symbolism
he
decorated
it
causing
wonderful
foliage
to
creep
about
the
text
and
showing
the
blossom
of
certain
mystical
flowers
with
emblems
of
strange
creatures
caught
and
bound
in
rose
thickets
all
was
dedicated
to
love
and
a
lover
madness
and
there
were
songs
in
it
which
haunted
him
with
their
lilt
and
refrain
when
the
book
was
finished
it
replaced
the
loose
leaves
as
his
constant
companion
by
day
and
night
three
times
a
day
he
repeated
his
ritual
to
himself
seeking
out
the
loneliest
places
in
the
woods
or
going
up
to
his
room
and
from
the
fixed
intentness
and
rapture
of
his
gaze
the
father
thought
him
still
severely
employed
in
the
questionable
process
of
composition
at
night
he
contrived
to
wake
for
his
strange
courtship
and
he
had
a
peculiar
ceremony
when
he
got
up
in
the
dark
and
lit
his
candle
from
a
steep
and
wild
hillside
not
far
from
the
house
he
had
cut
from
time
to
time
five
large
boughs
of
spiked
and
prickly
gorse
he
had
brought
them
into
the
house
one
by
one
and
had
hidden
them
in
the
big
box
that
stood
beside
his
bed
often
he
woke
up
weeping
and
murmuring
to
himself
the
words
of
one
of
his
songs
and
then
when
he
had
lit
the
candle
he
would
draw
out
the
and
place
them
on
the
floor
and
taking
off
his
nightgown
gently
lay
himself
down
on
the
bed
of
thorns
and
spines
lying
on
his
face
with
the
candle
and
the
book
before
him
he
would
softly
and
tenderly
repeat
the
praises
of
his
dear
dear
annie
and
as
he
turned
over
page
after
page
and
saw
the
raised
gold
of
the
majuscules
glow
and
flame
in
the
he
pressed
the
thorns
into
his
flesh
at
such
moments
he
tasted
in
all
its
acute
savor
the
joy
of
physical
pain
and
after
two
or
three
experiences
of
such
delights
he
altered
his
book
making
a
curious
sign
in
vermilion
on
the
margin
of
the
passages
where
he
was
to
inflict
on
himself
this
sweet
torture
never
did
he
fail
to
wake
at
the
appointed
hour
a
strong
effort
of
will
broke
through
all
the
heaviness
of
sleep
and
he
would
rise
up
joyful
though
weeping
and
reverently
set
his
thorny
bed
upon
the
floor
offering
his
pain
with
his
praise
when
he
had
whispered
the
last
word
and
had
risen
from
the
ground
his
body
would
be
all
freckled
with
drops
of
blood
he
used
to
view
the
marks
with
pride
here
and
there
a
spine
would
be
left
deep
in
the
flesh
and
he
would
pull
these
out
roughly
tearing
through
the
skin
on
some
nights
when
he
had
pressed
with
more
fervor
on
the
thorns
his
thighs
would
stream
with
blood
red
beads
standing
out
on
the
flesh
and
trickling
down
to
his
feet
he
had
some
difficulty
in
washing
away
the
bloodstains
so
as
not
to
leave
any
traces
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
servant
and
after
a
time
he
returned
no
more
to
his
bed
when
his
duty
had
been
accomplished
for
a
coverlet
he
had
a
dark
rug
a
good
deal
worn
and
in
this
he
would
wrap
his
naked
bleeding
body
and
lie
down
on
the
hard
floor
well
content
to
add
an
aching
rest
to
the
account
of
his
pleasures
he
was
covered
with
scars
and
those
that
healed
during
the
day
were
torn
open
afresh
at
night
the
pale
olive
skin
was
red
with
the
angry
marks
of
blood
and
the
graceful
form
of
the
young
man
appeared
like
the
body
of
a
tortured
martyr
he
grew
thinner
and
thinner
every
day
for
he
ate
but
little
the
skin
was
stretched
on
the
bones
of
his
face
and
the
black
eyes
burnt
in
dark
purple
hollows
his
relations
noticed
that
he
was
not
looking
well
now
lucian
it
perfect
madness
of
you
to
go
on
like
this
said
miss
deacon
one
morning
at
breakfast
look
how
your
hand
shakes
some
people
would
say
that
you
have
been
taking
brandy
and
all
that
you
want
is
a
little
medicine
and
yet
you
wo
be
advised
you
know
it
not
my
fault
i
have
asked
you
to
try
jelly
cooling
powders
again
and
again
he
remembered
the
forcible
exhibition
of
the
powders
when
he
was
a
boy
and
felt
thankful
that
those
days
were
over
he
only
grinned
at
his
cousin
and
swallowed
a
great
cup
of
strong
tea
to
steady
his
nerves
which
were
shaky
enough
dixon
saw
him
one
day
in
caermaen
it
was
very
hot
and
he
had
been
walking
rather
fast
the
scars
on
his
body
burnt
and
tingled
and
he
tottered
as
he
raised
his
hat
to
the
wife
she
decided
without
further
investigation
that
he
must
have
been
drinking
in
it
seems
a
mercy
that
poor
taylor
was
taken
she
said
to
her
husband
she
has
certainly
been
spared
a
great
deal
that
wretched
young
man
passed
me
this
afternoon
he
was
quite
intoxicated
how
very
said
said
dixon
a
little
port
my
dear
thank
you
merivale
i
will
have
another
glass
of
sherry
burrows
is
always
scolding
me
and
saying
i
take
something
to
keep
up
my
energy
and
this
sherry
is
so
weak
the
dixons
were
not
teetotalers
they
regretted
it
deeply
and
blamed
the
doctor
who
insisted
on
some
stimulant
however
there
was
some
consolation
in
trying
to
convert
the
parish
to
total
abstinence
or
as
they
curiously
called
it
temperance
old
women
were
warned
of
the
sin
of
taking
a
glass
of
beer
for
supper
aged
laborers
were
urged
to
try
the
new
temperance
drink
an
uncouth
beverage
styled
coffee
was
dispensed
at
the
dixon
preached
an
eloquent
temperance
sermon
soon
after
the
above
conversation
taking
as
his
text
of
the
leaven
of
the
in
his
discourse
he
showed
that
fermented
liquor
and
leaven
had
much
in
common
that
beer
was
at
the
present
day
put
away
during
passover
by
the
strict
jews
and
in
a
moving
peroration
he
urged
his
dear
brethren
and
more
especially
those
amongst
us
who
are
poor
in
this
world
goods
to
beware
indeed
of
that
evil
leaven
which
was
sapping
the
manhood
of
our
nation
dixon
cried
after
church
oh
merivale
what
a
beautiful
sermon
how
earnest
you
were
i
hope
it
will
do
good
dixon
swallowed
his
port
with
great
decorum
but
his
wife
fuddled
herself
every
evening
with
cheap
sherry
she
was
quite
unaware
of
the
fact
and
sometimes
wondered
in
a
dim
way
why
she
always
had
to
scold
the
children
after
dinner
and
so
strange
things
sometimes
happened
in
the
nursery
and
now
and
then
the
children
looked
queerly
at
one
another
after
a
woman
had
gone
out
panting
lucian
knew
nothing
of
his
accuser
trials
but
he
was
not
long
in
hearing
of
his
own
intoxication
the
next
time
he
went
down
to
caermaen
he
was
hailed
by
the
doctor
been
drinking
again
today
no
said
lucian
in
a
puzzled
voice
what
do
you
mean
oh
well
if
you
have
that
all
right
as
you
be
able
to
take
a
drop
with
me
come
along
in
over
the
whisky
and
pipes
lucian
heard
of
the
evil
rumors
affecting
his
character
dixon
assured
me
you
were
staggering
from
one
side
of
the
street
to
the
other
you
quite
frightened
her
she
said
then
she
asked
me
if
i
recommended
her
to
take
one
or
two
ounces
of
spirit
at
bedtime
for
the
palpitation
and
of
course
i
told
her
two
would
be
better
i
have
my
living
to
make
here
you
know
and
upon
my
word
i
think
she
wants
it
she
always
gurgling
inside
like
waterworks
i
wonder
how
old
dixon
can
stand
it
i
like
of
spirit
said
lucian
that
taking
it
medicinally
i
suppose
i
often
heard
of
ladies
who
have
to
it
medicinally
and
that
how
it
done
that
it
burrows
wo
to
me
tell
him
how
i
dislike
the
taste
of
spirits
but
he
says
they
are
absolutely
for
my
constitution
medical
man
on
something
at
bedtime
the
style
lucian
laughed
gently
all
these
people
had
become
indifferent
to
him
he
could
no
longer
feel
savage
indignation
at
their
little
hypocrisies
and
malignancies
their
voices
uttering
calumny
and
morality
and
futility
had
become
like
the
thin
shrill
angry
note
of
a
gnat
on
a
summer
evening
he
had
his
own
thoughts
and
his
own
life
and
he
passed
on
without
heeding
you
come
down
to
caermaen
pretty
often
do
you
said
the
doctor
i
seen
you
two
or
three
times
in
the
last
fortnight
yes
i
enjoy
the
walk
well
look
me
up
whenever
you
like
you
know
i
am
often
in
just
at
this
time
and
a
chat
with
a
human
being
is
bad
now
and
then
it
a
change
for
me
i
often
afraid
i
shall
lose
my
patients
the
doctor
had
the
weakness
of
these
terrible
puns
dragged
headlong
into
the
conversation
he
sometimes
exhibited
them
before
gervase
who
would
smile
in
a
faint
and
dignified
manner
and
say
ah
i
see
very
amusing
indeed
we
had
an
old
coachmen
once
who
was
very
clever
i
believe
at
that
sort
of
thing
but
gervase
was
obliged
to
send
him
away
the
laughter
of
the
other
domestics
was
so
very
boisterous
lucian
laughed
not
boisterously
but
at
the
joke
he
liked
burrows
feeling
that
he
was
a
man
and
not
an
automatic
gabbling
machine
you
look
a
little
pulled
down
said
the
doctor
when
lucian
rose
to
go
no
you
do
want
my
medicine
plenty
of
beef
and
beer
will
do
you
more
good
than
drugs
i
daresay
it
the
hot
weather
that
has
thinned
you
a
bit
oh
you
be
all
right
again
in
a
month
as
lucian
strolled
out
of
the
town
on
his
way
home
he
passed
a
small
crowd
of
urchins
assembled
at
the
corner
of
an
orchard
they
were
enjoying
themselves
immensely
the
healthy
boy
the
same
whom
he
had
seen
some
weeks
ago
operating
on
a
cat
seemed
to
have
recognized
his
selfishness
in
keeping
his
amusements
to
himself
he
had
found
a
poor
lost
puppy
a
little
creature
with
bright
pitiful
eyes
almost
human
in
their
fond
friendly
gaze
it
was
not
a
little
dog
it
was
certainly
not
that
famous
puppy
by
vick
out
of
wasp
it
had
rough
hair
and
a
foolish
long
tail
which
it
wagged
beseechingly
at
once
deprecating
severity
and
asking
kindness
the
poor
animal
had
evidently
been
used
to
gentle
treatment
it
would
look
up
in
a
boy
face
and
give
a
leap
fawning
on
him
and
then
bark
in
a
small
doubtful
voice
and
cower
a
moment
on
the
ground
astonished
perhaps
at
the
strangeness
the
bustle
and
animation
the
boys
were
beside
themselves
with
eagerness
there
was
quite
a
babble
of
voices
arguing
discussing
suggesting
each
one
had
a
plan
of
his
own
which
he
brought
before
the
leader
a
stout
and
sturdy
youth
drown
him
what
be
you
thinkin
of
mun
he
was
saying
no
sport
at
all
you
shut
your
mouth
gwaes

look
you
if
you
do
all
of
you
shut
your
bloody
mouths
i
take
the
dog
and
keep
him
there
now
he
was
a
born
leader
of
men
a
singular
depression
and
lowness
of
spirit
showed
itself
on
the
boys
faces
they
recognized
that
the
threat
might
very
possibly
be
executed
and
their
countenances
were
at
once
composed
to
humble
attention
the
puppy
was
still
cowering
on
the
ground
in
the
midst
of
them
one
or
two
tried
to
relieve
the
tension
of
their
feelings
by
kicking
him
in
the
belly
with
their
hobnail
boots
it
cried
out
with
the
pain
and
writhed
a
little
but
the
poor
little
beast
did
not
attempt
to
bite
or
even
snarl
it
looked
up
with
those
beseeching
friendly
eyes
at
its
persecutors
and
fawned
on
them
again
and
tried
to
wag
its
tail
and
be
merry
pretending
to
play
with
a
straw
on
the
road
hoping
perhaps
to
win
a
little
favor
in
that
way
the
leader
saw
the
moment
for
his
he
slowly
drew
a
piece
of
rope
from
his
pocket
what
do
you
say
to
that
mun
now
thomas
trevor
we
hang
him
over
that
there
bough
will
that
suit

bobby
williams
there
was
a
great
shriek
of
approval
and
delight
all
was
again
bustle
and
animation
i
tie

his
neck

out
mun

sure
he
wo

he
hai
mad
be
he
suppose
we
were
to
tie
up
his
mouth
first
the
puppy
still
fawned
and
curried
favor
and
wagged
that
sorry
tail
and
lay
down
crouching
on
one
side
on
the
ground
sad
and
sorry
in
his
heart
but
still
with
a
little
gleam
of
hope
for
now
and
again
he
tried
to
play
and
put
up
his
face
praying
with
those
fond
friendly
eyes
and
then
at
last
his
gambols
and
poor
efforts
for
mercy
ceased
and
he
lifted
up
his
wretched
voice
in
one
long
dismal
whine
of
despair
but
he
licked
the
hand
of
the
boy
that
tied
the
noose
he
was
slowly
and
gently
swung
into
the
air
as
lucian
went
by
unheeded
he
struggled
and
his
legs
twisted
and
writhed
the
healthy
boy
pulled
the
rope
and
his
friends
danced
and
shouted
with
glee
as
lucian
turned
the
corner
the
poor
dangling
body
was
swinging
to
and
fro
the
puppy
was
dying
but
he
still
kicked
a
little
lucian
went
on
his
way
hastily
and
shuddering
with
disgust
the
young
of
the
human
creature
were
really
too
horrible
they
defiled
the
earth
and
made
existence
unpleasant
as
the
pulpy
growth
of
a
noxious
and
obscene
fungus
spoils
an
agreeable
walk
the
sight
of
those
malignant
little
animals
with
mouths
that
uttered
cruelty
and
filthy
with
hands
dexterous
in
torture
and
feet
swift
to
run
all
evil
errands
had
given
him
a
shock
and
broken
up
the
world
of
strange
thoughts
in
which
he
had
been
dwelling
yet
it
was
no
good
being
angry
with
them
it
was
their
nature
to
be
very
loathsome
only
he
wished
they
would
go
about
their
hideous
amusements
in
their
own
back
gardens
where
nobody
could
see
them
at
work
it
was
too
bad
that
he
should
be
interrupted
and
offended
in
a
quiet
country
road
he
tried
to
put
the
incident
out
of
his
mind
as
if
the
whole
thing
had
been
a
disagreeable
story
and
the
visions
amongst
which
he
wished
to
move
were
beginning
to
return
when
he
was
again
rudely
disturbed
a
little
girl
a
pretty
child
of
eight
or
nine
was
coming
along
the
lane
to
meet
him
she
was
crying
bitterly
and
looking
to
left
and
right
and
calling
out
some
word
all
the
time
jack
jack
jack
little
jackie
jack
then
she
burst
into
tears
afresh
and
peered
into
the
hedge
and
tried
to
peep
through
a
gate
into
a
field
jackie
jackie
jackie
she
came
up
to
lucian
sobbing
as
if
her
heart
would
break
and
dropped
him
an
curtsy
oh
please
sir
have
you
seen
my
little
jackie
what
do
you
mean
said
lucian
what
is
it
lost
a
little
dog
please
sir
a
little
terrier
dog
with
white
hair
father
gave
me
him
a
month
ago
and
said
i
might
keep
him
someone
did
leave
the
garden
gate
open
this
afternoon
and
he
must
got
away
sir
and
i
was
so
fond
of
him
sir
he
was
so
playful
and
loving
and
i
be
afraid
he
be
lost
she
began
to
call
again
without
waiting
for
an
answer
jack
jack
jack
i
afraid
some
boys
have
got
your
little
dog
said
lucian
killed
him
you
better
go
back
home
he
went
on
walking
as
fast
as
he
could
in
his
endeavor
to
get
beyond
the
noise
of
the
child
crying
it
distressed
him
and
he
wished
to
think
of
other
things
he
stamped
his
foot
angrily
on
the
ground
as
he
recalled
the
annoyances
of
the
afternoon
and
longed
for
some
hermitage
on
the
mountains
far
above
the
stench
and
the
sound
of
humanity
a
little
farther
and
he
came
to
croeswen
where
the
road
branched
off
to
right
and
left
there
was
a
triangular
plot
of
grass
between
the
two
roads
there
the
cross
had
once
stood
the
goodly
and
famous
roode
of
the
old
local
chronicle
the
words
echoed
in
lucian
ears
as
he
went
by
on
the
right
hand
there
were
five
steps
that
did
go
up
to
the
first
pace
and
seven
steps
to
the
second
pace
all
of
clene
hewn
ashler
and
all
above
it
was
most
curiously
and
gloriously
wrought
with
thorowgh
carved
work
in
the
highest
place
was
the
holy
roode
with
christ
upon
the
cross
having
marie
on
the
one
syde
and
john
on
the
other
and
below
were
six
splendent
and
glisteringe
archaungels
that
bore
up
the
roode
and
beneath
them
in
their
stories
were
the
most
fair
and
noble
images
of
the
xii
apostles
and
of
divers
other
saints
and
martirs
and
in
the
lowest
storie
there
was
a
marvelous
imagerie
of
divers
beasts
such
as
oxen
and
horses
and
swine
and
little
dogs
and
peacocks
all
done
in
the
finest
and
most
curious
wise
so
that
they
all
seemed
as
they
were
caught
in
a
wood
of
thorns
the
which
is
their
torment
of
this
life
and
here
once
in
the
year
was
a
marvelous
solemn
service
when
the
parson
of
caermaen
came
out
with
the
singers
and
all
the
people
singing
the
psalm
omnia
as
they
passed
along
the
road
in
their
procession
and
when
they
stood
at
the
roode
the
priest
did
there
his
service
making
certain
prayers
for
the
beasts
and
then
he
went
up
to
the
first
pace
and
preached
a
sermon
to
the
people
shewing
them
that
as
our
lord
jhu
dyed
upon
the
tree
of
his
deare
mercy
for
us
so
we
too
owe
mercy
to
the
beasts
his
creatures
for
that
they
are
all
his
poor
lieges
and
silly
servants
and
that
like
as
the
holy
aungells
do
their
suit
to
him
on
high
and
the
blessed
xii
apostles
and
the
martirs
and
all
the
blissful
saints
served
him
aforetime
on
earth
and
now
praise
him
in
heaven
so
also
do
the
beasts
serve
him
though
they
be
in
torment
of
life
and
below
men
for
their
spirit
goeth
downward
as
holy
writ
teacheth
us
it
was
a
quaint
old
record
a
curious
relic
of
what
the
modern
inhabitants
of
caermaen
called
the
dark
ages
a
few
of
the
stones
that
had
formed
the
base
of
the
cross
still
remained
in
position
grey
with
age
blotched
with
black
lichen
and
green
moss
the
remainder
of
the
famous
rood
had
been
used
to
mend
the
roads
to
build
pigsties
and
domestic
offices
it
had
turned
protestant
in
fact
indeed
if
it
had
remained
the
parson
of
caermaen
would
have
had
no
time
for
the
service
the
the
portuguese
missions
the
society
for
the
conversion
of
the
jews
and
important
social
duties
took
up
all
his
leisure
besides
he
thought
the
whole
ceremony
unscriptural
lucian
passed
on
his
way
wondering
at
the
strange
contrasts
of
the
middle
ages
how
was
it
that
people
who
could
devise
so
beautiful
a
service
believed
in
witchcraft
demoniacal
possession
and
obsession
in
the
incubus
and
succubus
and
in
the
sabbath
an
in
many
other
horrible
absurdities
it
seemed
astonishing
that
anybody
could
even
pretend
to
credit
such
monstrous
tales
but
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
dread
of
old
women
who
rode
on
broomsticks
and
liked
black
cats
was
once
a
very
genuine
terror
a
cold
wind
blew
up
from
the
river
at
sunset
and
the
scars
on
his
body
began
to
burn
and
tingle
the
pain
recalled
his
ritual
to
him
and
he
began
to
recite
it
as
he
walked
along
he
had
cut
a
branch
of
thorn
from
the
hedge
and
placed
it
next
to
his
skin
pressing
the
spikes
into
the
flesh
with
his
hand
till
the
warm
blood
ran
down
he
felt
it
was
an
exquisite
and
sweet
observance
for
her
sake
and
then
he
thought
of
the
secret
golden
palace
he
was
building
for
her
the
rare
and
wonderful
city
rising
in
his
imagination
as
the
solemn
night
began
to
close
about
the
earth
and
the
last
glimmer
of
the
sun
faded
from
the
hills
he
gave
himself
anew
to
the
woman
his
body
and
his
mind
all
that
he
was
and
all
that
he
had
iv
in
the
course
of
the
week
lucian
again
visited
caermaen
he
wished
to
view
the
amphitheatre
more
precisely
to
note
the
exact
position
of
the
ancient
walls
to
gaze
up
the
valley
from
certain
points
within
the
town
to
imprint
minutely
and
clearly
on
his
mind
the
surge
of
the
hills
about
the
city
and
the
dark
tapestry
of
the
hanging
woods
and
he
lingered
in
the
museum
where
the
relics
of
the
roman
occupation
had
been
stored
he
was
interested
in
the
fragments
of
tessellated
floors
in
the
glowing
gold
of
drinking
cups
the
curious
beads
of
fused
and
colored
glass
the
carved
the
that
still
retained
the
memory
of
unctuous
odors
the
necklaces
brooches
of
gold
and
silver
and
other
intimate
objects
which
had
once
belonged
to
roman
ladies
one
of
the
glass
flagons
buried
in
damp
earth
for
many
hundred
years
had
gathered
in
its
dark
grave
all
the
splendors
of
the
light
and
now
shone
like
an
opal
with
a
moonlight
glamour
and
gleams
of
gold
and
pale
sunset
green
and
imperial
purple
then
there
were
the
wine
jars
of
red
earthenware
the
memorial
stones
from
graves
and
the
heads
of
broken
gods
with
fragments
of
occult
things
used
in
the
secret
rites
of
mithras
lucian
read
on
the
labels
where
all
these
objects
were
found
in
the
churchyard
beneath
the
turf
of
the
meadow
and
in
the
old
cemetery
near
the
forest
and
whenever
it
was
possible
he
would
make
his
way
to
the
spot
of
discovery
and
imagine
the
long
darkness
that
had
hidden
gold
and
stone
and
amber
all
these
investigations
were
necessary
for
the
scheme
he
had
in
view
so
he
became
for
some
time
quite
a
familiar
figure
in
the
dusty
deserted
streets
and
in
the
meadows
by
the
river
his
continual
visits
to
caermaen
were
a
tortuous
puzzle
to
the
inhabitants
who
flew
to
their
windows
at
the
sound
of
a
step
on
the
uneven
pavements
they
were
at
a
loss
in
their
conjectures
his
motive
for
coming
down
three
times
a
week
must
of
course
be
bad
but
it
seemed
undiscoverable
and
lucian
on
his
side
was
at
first
a
good
deal
put
out
by
occasional
encounters
with
members
of
the
gervase
or
dixon
or
colley
tribes
he
had
often
to
stop
and
exchange
a
few
conventional
expressions
and
such
meetings
casual
as
they
were
annoyed
and
distracted
him
he
was
no
longer
infuriated
or
wounded
by
sneers
of
contempt
or
by
the
cackling
laughter
of
the
young
people
when
they
passed
him
on
the
road
his
hat
was
a
shocking
one
and
his
untidiness
terrible
but
such
incidents
were
unpleasant
just
as
the
smell
of
a
drain
was
unpleasant
and
threw
the
strange
mechanism
of
his
thoughts
out
of
fear
for
the
time
then
he
had
been
disgusted
by
the
affair
of
the
boys
and
the
little
dog
the
loathsomeness
of
it
had
quite
broken
up
his
fancies
he
had
read
books
of
modern
occultism
and
remembered
some
of
the
experiments
described
the
adept
it
was
alleged
could
transfer
the
sense
of
consciousness
from
his
brain
to
the
foot
or
hand
he
could
annihilate
the
world
around
him
and
pass
into
another
sphere
lucian
wondered
whether
he
could
not
perform
some
such
operation
for
his
own
benefit
human
beings
were
constantly
annoying
him
and
getting
in
his
way
was
it
not
possible
to
annihilate
the
race
or
at
all
events
to
reduce
them
to
wholly
insignificant
forms
a
certain
process
suggested
itself
to
his
mind
a
work
partly
mental
and
partly
physical
and
after
two
or
three
experiments
he
found
to
his
astonishment
and
delight
that
it
was
successful
here
he
thought
he
had
discovered
one
of
the
secrets
of
true
magic
this
was
the
key
to
the
symbolic
transmutations
of
the
eastern
tales
the
adept
could
in
truth
change
those
who
were
obnoxious
to
him
into
harmless
and
unimportant
shapes
not
as
in
the
letter
of
the
old
stories
by
transforming
the
enemy
but
by
transforming
himself
the
magician
puts
men
below
him
by
going
up
higher
as
one
looks
down
on
a
mountain
city
from
a
loftier
crag
the
stones
on
the
road
and
such
petty
obstacles
do
not
trouble
the
wise
man
on
the
great
journey
and
so
lucian
when
obliged
to
stop
and
converse
with
his
to
listen
to
their
poor
pretences
and
inanities
was
no
more
inconvenienced
than
when
he
had
to
climb
an
awkward
stile
in
the
course
of
a
walk
as
for
the
more
unpleasant
manifestations
of
humanity
after
all
they
no
longer
concerned
him
men
intent
on
the
great
purpose
did
not
suffer
the
current
of
their
thoughts
to
be
broken
by
the
buzzing
of
a
fly
caught
in
a
spider
web
so
why
should
he
be
perturbed
by
the
misery
of
a
puppy
in
the
hands
of
village
boys
the
fly
no
doubt
endured
its
tortures
lying
helpless
and
bound
in
those
slimy
bands
it
cried
out
in
its
thin
voice
when
the
claws
of
the
horrible
monster
fastened
on
it
but
its
dying
agonies
had
never
vexed
the
reverie
of
a
lover
lucian
saw
no
reason
why
the
boys
should
offend
him
more
than
the
spider
or
why
he
should
pity
the
dog
more
than
he
pitied
the
fly
the
talk
of
the
men
and
women
might
be
wearisome
and
inept
and
often
malignant
but
he
could
not
imagine
an
alchemist
at
the
moment
of
success
a
general
in
the
hour
of
victory
or
a
financier
with
a
gigantic
scheme
of
swindling
well
on
the
market
being
annoyed
by
the
buzz
of
insects
the
spider
is
no
doubt
a
very
terrible
brute
with
a
hideous
mouth
and
hairy
claws
when
seen
through
the
microscope
but
lucian
had
taken
away
the
microscope
from
his
eyes
he
could
now
walk
the
streets
of
caermaen
confident
and
secure
without
any
dread
of
interruption
for
at
a
moment
notice
the
transformation
could
be
effected
once
burrows
caught
him
and
made
him
promise
to
attend
a
bazaar
that
was
to
be
held
in
aid
of
the
hungarian
protestants
lucian
assented
the
more
willingly
as
he
wished
to
pay
a
visit
to
certain
curious
mounds
on
a
hill
a
little
way
out
of
the
town
and
he
calculated
on
slinking
off
from
the
bazaar
early
in
the
afternoon
lord
beamys
was
visiting
sir
vivian
ponsonby
a
local
magnate
and
had
kindly
promised
to
drive
over
and
declare
the
bazaar
open
it
was
a
solemn
moment
when
the
carriage
drew
up
and
the
great
man
alighted
he
was
rather
an
old
nobleman
but
the
clergy
and
gentry
their
wives
and
sons
and
daughters
welcomed
him
with
great
and
unctuous
joy
conversations
were
broken
off
in
slow
people
gaped
not
realizing
why
their
friends
had
so
suddenly
left
them
the
meyricks
came
up
hot
and
perspiring
in
fear
lest
they
should
be
too
late
miss
colley
a
yellow
virgin
of
austere
regard
smiled
largely
dixon
beckoned
wildly
with
her
parasol
to
the
girls
who
were
idly
strolling
in
a
distant
part
of
the
field
and
the
archdeacon
ran
at
full
speed
the
air
grew
dark
with
bows
and
resonant
with
the
genial
laugh
of
the
archdeacon
the
cackle
of
the
younger
ladies
and
the
shrill
voices
of
the
matrons
those
smiled
who
had
never
smiled
before
and
on
some
maiden
faces
there
hovered
that
look
of
adoring
ecstasy
with
which
the
old
maidens
graced
their
angels
then
when
all
the
due
rites
had
been
performed
the
company
turned
and
began
to
walk
towards
the
booths
of
their
small
vanity
fair
lord
beamys
led
the
way
with
gervase
dixon
followed
with
sir
vivian
ponsonby
and
the
multitudes
that
followed
cried
saying
what
a
dear
old
man
is
it
of
him
to
come
all
this
way
what
a
sweet
expression
is
it
i
think
he
an
old
love
one
of
the
good
old
sort
real
english
nobleman
oh
most
correct
i
assure
you
if
a
girl
gets
into
trouble
notice
to
quit
at
once
always
stands
by
the
church
twenty
livings
in
his
gift
voted
for
the
public
worship
regulation
act
ten
thousand
acres
strictly
preserved
the
old
lord
was
leering
pleasantly
and
muttering
to
himself
some
fine
gals
here
like
the
looks
of
that
filly
with
the
pink
hat
ought
to
see
more
of
her
she
give
lotty
points
the
pomp
swept
slowly
across
the
grass
the
archdeacon
had
got
hold
of
dixon
and
they
were
discussing
the
misdeeds
of
some
clergyman
in
the
rural
deanery
i
can
scarce
credit
it
said
dixon
oh
i
assure
you
there
can
be
no
doubt
we
have
witnesses
there
can
be
no
question
that
there
was
a
procession
at
llanfihangel
on
the
sunday
before
easter
the
choir
and
minister
went
round
the
church
carrying
palm
branches
in
their
hands
very
shocking
it
has
distressed
the
bishop
martin
is
a
man
enough
and
all
that
but
those
sort
of
things
ca
be
tolerated
the
bishop
told
me
that
he
had
set
his
face
against
processions
quite
right
the
bishop
is
perfectly
right
processions
are
unscriptural
it
the
thin
end
of
the
wedge
you
know
dixon
exactly
i
have
always
resisted
anything
of
the
kind
here
right
you
know
martin
is
so
there
a
of
doing
things
the
scriptural
procession
led
by
lord
beamys
broke
up
when
the
stalls
were
reached
and
gathered
round
the
nobleman
as
he
declared
the
bazaar
open
lucian
was
sitting
on
a
a
little
distance
off
looking
dreamily
before
him
and
all
that
he
saw
was
a
swarm
of
flies
clustering
and
buzzing
about
a
lump
of
tainted
meat
that
lay
on
the
grass
the
spectacle
in
no
way
interrupted
the
harmony
of
his
thoughts
and
soon
after
the
opening
of
the
bazaar
he
went
quietly
away
walking
across
the
fields
in
the
direction
of
the
ancient
mounds
he
desired
to
inspect
all
these
journeys
of
his
to
caermaen
and
its
neighborhood
had
a
peculiar
object
he
was
gradually
leveling
to
the
dust
the
squalid
kraals
of
modern
times
and
rebuilding
the
splendid
and
golden
city
of
siluria
all
this
mystic
town
was
for
the
delight
of
his
sweetheart
and
himself
for
her
the
wonderful
villas
the
shady
courts
the
magic
of
tessellated
pavements
and
the
hangings
of
rich
stuffs
with
their
intricate
and
glowing
patterns
lucian
wandered
all
day
through
the
shining
streets
taking
shelter
sometimes
in
the
gardens
beneath
the
dense
and
gloomy
ilex
trees
and
listening
to
the
plash
and
trickle
of
the
fountains
sometimes
he
would
look
out
of
a
window
and
watch
the
crowd
and
color
of
the
and
now
and
again
a
ship
came
up
the
river
bringing
exquisite
silks
and
the
merchandise
of
unknown
lands
in
the
far
east
he
had
made
a
curious
and
accurate
map
of
the
town
he
proposed
to
inhabit
in
which
every
villa
was
set
down
and
named
he
drew
his
lines
to
scale
with
the
gravity
of
a
surveyor
and
studied
the
plan
till
he
was
able
to
find
his
way
from
house
to
house
on
the
darkest
summer
night
on
the
southern
slopes
about
the
town
there
were
vineyards
always
under
a
glowing
sun
and
sometimes
he
ventured
to
the
furthest
ridge
of
the
forest
where
the
wild
people
still
lingered
that
he
might
catch
the
golden
gleam
of
the
city
far
away
as
the
light
quivered
and
scintillated
on
the
glittering
tiles
and
there
were
gardens
outside
the
city
gates
where
strange
and
brilliant
flowers
grew
filling
the
hot
air
with
their
odor
and
scenting
the
breeze
that
blew
along
the
streets
the
dull
modern
life
was
far
away
and
people
who
saw
him
at
this
period
wondered
what
was
amiss
the
abstraction
of
his
glance
was
obvious
even
to
eyes
not
but
men
and
women
had
lost
all
their
power
of
annoyance
and
vexation
they
could
no
longer
even
interrupt
his
thought
for
a
moment
he
could
listen
to
dixon
with
apparent
attention
while
he
was
in
reality
enraptured
by
the
entreating
music
of
the
double
flute
played
by
a
girl
in
the
garden
of
avallaunius
for
that
was
the
name
he
had
taken
dixon
was
innocently
discoursing
archeology
giving
a
brief
of
the
view
expressed
by
wyndham
at
the
last
meeting
of
the
antiquarian
society
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
temple
of
diana
stood
there
in
pagan
times
he
concluded
and
lucian
assented
to
the
opinion
and
asked
a
few
questions
which
seemed
pertinent
enough
but
all
the
time
the
flute
notes
were
sounding
in
his
ears
and
the
ilex
threw
a
purple
shadow
on
the
white
pavement
before
his
villa
a
boy
came
forward
from
the
garden
he
had
been
walking
amongst
the
vines
and
plucking
the
ripe
grapes
and
the
juice
had
trickled
down
over
his
breast
standing
beside
the
girl
unashamed
in
the
sunlight
he
began
to
sing
one
of
sappho
love
songs
his
voice
was
as
full
and
rich
as
a
woman
but
purged
of
all
emotion
he
was
an
instrument
of
music
in
the
flesh
lucian
looked
at
him
steadily
the
white
perfect
body
shone
against
the
roses
and
the
blue
of
the
sky
clear
and
gleaming
as
marble
in
the
glare
of
the
sun
the
words
he
sang
burned
and
flamed
with
passion
and
he
was
as
unconscious
of
their
meaning
as
the
twin
pipes
of
the
flute
and
the
girl
was
smiling
the
vicar
shook
hands
and
went
on
well
pleased
with
his
remarks
on
the
temple
of
diana
and
also
with
lucian
polite
interest
he
is
by
no
means
wanting
in
intelligence
he
said
to
his
family
a
little
curious
in
manner
perhaps
but
not
stupid
oh
papa
said
henrietta
do
you
think
he
is
rather
silly
he
talk
about
anything
anything
interesting
i
mean
and
he
pretends
to
know
a
lot
about
books
but
i
heard
him
say
the
other
day
he
had
never
read
prince
of
the
house
of
or
fancy
the
vicar
had
not
interrupted
lucian
the
sun
still
beat
upon
the
roses
and
a
little
breeze
bore
the
scent
of
them
to
his
nostrils
together
with
the
smell
of
grapes
and
he
had
become
curious
in
sensation
and
as
he
leant
back
upon
the
cushions
covered
with
glistening
yellow
silk
he
was
trying
to
analyze
a
strange
ingredient
in
the
perfume
of
the
air
he
had
penetrated
far
beyond
the
crude
distinctions
of
modern
times
beyond
the
rough
there
a
smell
of
roses
there
must
be
sweetbriar
somewhere
modern
perceptions
of
odor
were
he
knew
far
below
those
of
the
savage
in
delicacy
the
degraded
black
fellow
of
australia
could
distinguish
odors
in
a
way
that
made
the
consumer
of
damper
stare
in
amazement
but
the
savage
sensations
were
all
strictly
utilitarian
to
lucian
as
he
sat
in
the
cool
porch
his
feet
on
the
marble
the
air
came
laden
with
scents
as
subtly
and
wonderfully
interwoven
and
contrasted
as
the
harmonica
of
a
great
master
the
stained
marble
of
the
pavement
gave
a
cool
reminiscence
of
the
italian
mountain
the
roses
palpitating
in
the
sunlight
sent
out
an
odor
mystical
as
passion
itself
and
there
was
the
hint
of
inebriation
in
the
perfume
of
the
trellised
vines
besides
these
the
girl
desire
and
the
unripe
innocence
of
the
boy
were
as
distinct
as
benzoin
and
myrrh
both
delicious
and
exquisite
and
exhaled
as
freely
as
the
scent
of
the
roses
but
there
was
another
element
that
puzzled
him
an
aromatic
suggestion
of
the
forest
he
understood
it
at
last
it
was
the
vapor
of
the
great
red
pines
that
grew
beyond
the
garden
their
spicy
needles
were
burning
in
the
sun
and
the
smell
was
as
fragrant
as
the
fume
of
incense
blown
from
far
the
soft
entreaty
of
the
flute
and
the
swelling
rapture
of
the
boy
voice
beat
on
the
air
together
and
lucian
wondered
whether
there
were
in
the
nature
of
things
any
true
distinction
between
the
impressions
of
sound
and
scent
and
color
the
violent
blue
of
the
sky
the
song
and
the
odours
seemed
rather
varied
symbols
of
one
mystery
than
distinct
entities
he
could
almost
imagine
that
the
innocence
was
indeed
a
perfume
and
that
the
palpitating
roses
had
become
a
sonorous
chant
in
the
curious
silence
which
followed
the
last
notes
when
the
boy
and
girl
had
passed
under
the
purple
ilex
shadow
he
fell
into
a
reverie
the
fancy
that
sensations
are
symbols
and
not
realities
hovered
in
his
mind
and
led
him
to
speculate
as
to
whether
they
could
not
actually
be
transmuted
one
into
another
it
was
possible
he
thought
that
a
whole
continent
of
knowledge
had
been
undiscovered
the
energies
of
men
having
been
expended
in
unimportant
and
foolish
directions
modern
ingenuity
had
been
employed
on
such
trifles
as
locomotive
engines
electric
cables
and
cantilever
bridges
on
elaborate
devices
for
bringing
uninteresting
people
nearer
together
the
ancients
had
been
almost
as
foolish
because
they
had
mistaken
the
symbol
for
the
thing
signified
it
was
not
the
material
banquet
which
really
mattered
but
the
thought
of
it
it
was
almost
as
futile
to
eat
and
take
emetics
and
eat
again
as
to
invent
telephones
and
boilers
as
for
some
other
ancient
methods
of
enjoying
life
one
might
as
well
set
oneself
to
improve
calico
printing
at
once
only
in
the
garden
of
avallaunius
said
lucian
to
himself
is
the
true
and
exquisite
science
to
be
found
he
could
imagine
a
man
who
was
able
to
live
in
one
sense
while
he
pleased
to
whom
for
example
every
impression
of
touch
taste
hearing
or
seeing
should
be
translated
into
odor
who
at
the
desired
kiss
should
be
ravished
with
the
scent
of
dark
violets
to
whom
music
should
be
the
perfume
of
a
at
dawn
when
now
and
again
he
voluntarily
resumed
the
experience
of
common
life
it
was
that
he
might
return
with
greater
delight
to
the
garden
in
the
city
of
refuge
in
the
actual
world
the
talk
was
of
nonconformists
the
lodger
franchise
and
the
stock
exchange
people
were
constantly
reading
newspapers
drinking
australian
burgundy
and
doing
other
things
equally
absurd
they
either
looked
shocked
when
the
fine
art
of
pleasure
was
mentioned
or
confused
it
with
going
to
musical
comedies
drinking
bad
whisky
and
keeping
late
hours
in
disreputable
and
vulgar
company
he
found
to
his
amusement
that
the
profligate
were
by
many
degrees
duller
than
the
pious
but
that
the
most
tedious
of
all
were
the
persons
who
preached
promiscuity
and
called
their
system
of
pigging
the
new
morality
he
went
back
to
the
city
lovingly
because
it
was
built
and
adorned
for
his
love
as
the
metaphysicians
insist
on
the
consciousness
of
the
ego
as
the
implied
basis
of
all
thought
so
he
knew
that
it
was
she
in
whom
he
had
found
himself
and
through
whom
and
for
whom
all
the
true
life
existed
he
felt
that
annie
had
taught
him
the
rare
magic
which
had
created
the
garden
of
avallaunius
it
was
for
her
that
he
sought
strange
secrets
and
tried
to
penetrate
the
mysteries
of
sensation
for
he
could
only
give
her
wonderful
thoughts
and
a
wonderful
life
and
a
poor
body
stained
with
the
scars
of
his
worship
it
was
with
this
object
that
of
making
the
offering
of
himself
a
worthy
one
that
he
continually
searched
for
new
and
exquisite
experiences
he
made
lovers
come
before
him
and
confess
their
secrets
he
pried
into
the
inmost
mysteries
of
innocence
and
shame
noting
how
passion
and
reluctance
strive
together
for
the
mastery
in
the
amphitheatre
he
sometimes
witnessed
strange
entertainments
in
which
such
tales
as
and
and
golden
were
performed
before
him
these
shows
were
always
given
at
nighttime
a
circle
of
surrounded
the
stage
in
the
center
and
above
all
the
tiers
of
seats
were
dark
he
would
look
up
at
the
soft
blue
of
the
summer
sky
and
at
the
vast
dim
mountain
hovering
like
a
cloud
in
the
west
and
then
at
the
scene
illumined
by
a
flaring
light
and
contrasted
with
violent
shadows
the
subdued
mutter
of
conversation
in
a
strange
language
rising
from
bench
after
bench
swift
hissing
whispers
of
explanation
now
and
then
a
shout
or
a
cry
as
the
interest
deepened
the
restless
tossing
of
the
people
as
the
end
drew
near
an
arm
lifted
a
cloak
thrown
back
the
sudden
blaze
of
a
torch
lighting
up
purple
or
white
or
the
gleam
of
gold
in
the
black
serried
ranks
these
were
impressions
that
seemed
always
amazing
and
above
the
dusky
light
of
the
stars
around
the
meadows
and
the
twinkle
of
lamps
from
the
still
city
the
cry
of
the
sentries
about
the
walls
the
wash
of
the
tide
filling
the
river
and
the
salt
savor
of
the
sea
with
such
a
scenic
ornament
he
saw
the
tale
of
apuleius
represented
heard
the
names
of
fotis
and
byrrhaena
and
lucius
proclaimed
and
the
deep
intonation
of
such
sentences
as
veneris
hortator
et
armiger
liber
advenit
the
tale
went
on
through
all
its
marvelous
adventures
and
lucian
left
the
amphitheatre
and
walked
beside
the
river
where
he
could
hear
indistinctly
the
noise
of
voices
and
the
singing
latin
and
note
how
the
rumor
of
the
stage
mingled
with
the
murmur
of
the
shuddering
reeds
and
the
cool
lapping
of
the
tide
then
came
the
farewell
of
the
cantor
the
thunder
of
applause
the
crash
of
cymbals
the
calling
of
the
flutes
and
the
surge
of
the
wind
in
the
great
dark
wood
at
other
times
it
was
his
chief
pleasure
to
spend
a
whole
day
in
a
vineyard
planted
on
the
steep
slope
beyond
the
bridge
a
grey
stone
seat
had
been
placed
beneath
a
shady
laurel
and
here
he
often
sat
without
motion
or
gesture
for
many
hours
below
him
the
tawny
river
swept
round
the
town
in
a
half
circle
he
could
see
the
swirl
of
the
yellow
water
its
eddies
and
miniature
whirlpools
as
the
tide
poured
up
from
the
south
and
beyond
the
river
the
strong
circuit
of
the
walls
and
within
the
city
glittered
like
a
charming
piece
of
mosaic
he
freed
himself
from
the
obtuse
modern
view
of
towns
as
places
where
human
beings
live
and
make
money
and
rejoice
or
suffer
for
from
the
standpoint
of
the
moment
such
facts
were
wholly
impertinent
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
for
his
present
purpose
the
tawny
sheen
and
shimmer
of
the
tide
was
the
only
fact
of
importance
about
the
river
and
so
he
regarded
the
city
as
a
curious
work
in
jewelry
its
radiant
marble
porticoes
the
white
walls
of
the
villas
a
dome
of
burning
copper
the
flash
and
scintillation
of
tiled
roofs
the
quiet
red
of
brickwork
dark
groves
of
ilex
and
cypress
and
laurel
glowing
and
here
and
there
the
silver
of
a
fountain
seemed
arranged
and
contrasted
with
a
wonderful
art
and
the
town
appeared
a
delicious
ornament
every
cube
of
color
owing
its
place
to
the
thought
and
inspiration
of
the
artificer
lucian
as
he
gazed
from
his
arbour
amongst
the
trellised
vines
lost
none
of
the
subtle
pleasures
of
the
sight
noting
every
of
color
he
let
his
eyes
dwell
for
a
moment
on
the
scarlet
flash
of
poppies
and
then
on
a
glazed
roof
which
in
the
glance
of
the
sun
seemed
to
spout
white
fire
a
square
of
vines
was
like
some
rare
green
stone
the
grapes
were
massed
so
richly
amongst
the
vivid
leaves
that
even
from
far
off
there
was
a
sense
of
irregular
flecks
and
stains
of
purple
running
through
the
green
the
laurel
garths
were
like
cool
jade
the
gardens
where
red
yellow
blue
and
white
gleamed
together
in
a
mist
of
heat
had
the
radiance
of
opal
the
river
was
a
band
of
dull
gold
on
every
side
as
if
to
enhance
the
preciousness
of
the
city
the
woods
hung
dark
on
the
hills
above
the
sky
was
violet
specked
with
minute
feathery
clouds
white
as
snowflakes
it
reminded
him
of
a
beautiful
bowl
in
his
villa
the
ground
was
of
that
same
brilliant
blue
and
the
artist
had
fused
into
the
work
when
it
was
hot
particles
of
pure
white
glass
for
lucian
this
was
a
spectacle
that
enchanted
many
hours
leaning
on
one
hand
he
would
gaze
at
the
city
glowing
in
the
sunlight
till
the
purple
shadows
grew
down
the
slopes
and
the
long
melodious
trumpet
sounded
for
the
evening
watch
then
as
he
strolled
beneath
the
trellises
he
would
see
all
the
radiant
facets
glimmering
out
and
the
city
faded
into
haze
a
white
wall
shining
here
and
there
and
the
gardens
veiled
in
a
dim
glow
of
color
on
such
an
evening
he
would
go
home
with
the
sense
that
he
had
truly
lived
a
day
having
received
for
many
hours
the
most
acute
impressions
of
beautiful
color
often
he
spent
the
night
in
the
cool
court
of
his
villa
lying
amidst
soft
cushions
heaped
upon
the
marble
bench
a
lamp
stood
on
the
table
at
his
elbow
its
light
making
the
water
in
the
cistern
twinkle
there
was
no
sound
in
the
court
except
the
soft
continual
plashing
of
the
fountain
throughout
these
still
hours
he
would
meditate
and
he
became
more
than
ever
convinced
that
man
could
if
he
pleased
become
lord
of
his
own
sensations
this
surely
was
the
true
meaning
concealed
under
the
beautiful
symbolism
of
alchemy
some
years
before
he
had
read
many
of
the
wonderful
alchemical
books
of
the
later
middle
ages
and
had
suspected
that
something
other
than
the
turning
of
lead
into
gold
was
intended
this
impression
was
deepened
when
he
looked
into
de
by
vaughan
the
brother
of
the
silurist
and
he
had
long
puzzled
himself
in
the
endeavor
to
find
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
hermetic
mystery
and
of
the
red
powder
glistening
and
glorious
in
the
sun
and
the
solution
shone
out
at
last
bright
and
amazing
as
he
lay
quiet
in
the
court
of
avallaunius
he
knew
that
he
himself
had
solved
the
riddle
that
he
held
in
his
hand
the
powder
of
projection
the
stone
transmuting
all
it
touched
to
fine
gold
the
gold
of
exquisite
impressions
he
understood
now
something
of
the
alchemical
symbolism
the
crucible
and
the
furnace
the
green
dragon
and
the
son
blessed
of
the
fire
had
he
saw
a
peculiar
meaning
he
understood
too
why
the
uninitiated
were
warned
of
the
terror
and
danger
through
which
they
must
pass
and
the
vehemence
with
which
the
adepts
disclaimed
all
desire
for
material
riches
no
longer
struck
him
as
singular
the
wise
man
does
not
endure
the
torture
of
the
furnace
in
order
that
he
may
be
able
to
compete
with
operators
in
pork
and
company
promoters
neither
a
steam
yacht
nor
a
nor
three
liveried
footmen
would
add
at
all
to
his
gratifications
again
lucian
said
to
himself
only
in
the
court
of
avallaunius
is
the
true
science
of
the
exquisite
to
be
found
he
saw
the
true
gold
into
which
the
beggarly
matter
of
existence
may
be
transmuted
by
spagyric
art
a
succession
of
delicious
moments
all
the
rare
flavors
of
life
concentrated
purged
of
their
lees
and
preserved
in
a
beautiful
vessel
the
moonlight
fell
green
on
the
fountain
and
on
the
curious
pavements
and
in
the
long
sweet
silence
of
the
night
he
lay
still
and
felt
that
thought
itself
was
an
acute
pleasure
to
be
expressed
perhaps
in
terms
of
odor
or
color
by
the
true
artist
and
he
gave
himself
other
and
even
stranger
gratifications
outside
the
city
walls
between
the
baths
and
the
amphitheatre
was
a
tavern
a
place
where
wonderful
people
met
to
drink
wonderful
wine
there
he
saw
priests
of
mithras
and
isis
and
of
more
occult
rites
from
the
east
men
who
wore
robes
of
bright
colours
and
grotesque
ornaments
symbolizing
secret
things
they
spoke
amongst
themselves
in
a
rich
jargon
of
colored
words
full
of
hidden
meanings
and
the
sense
of
matters
unintelligible
to
the
uninitiated
alluding
to
what
was
concealed
beneath
roses
and
calling
each
other
by
strange
names
and
there
were
actors
who
gave
the
shows
in
the
amphitheatre
officers
of
the
legion
who
had
served
in
wild
places
singers
and
dancing
girls
and
heroes
of
strange
adventure
the
walls
of
the
tavern
were
covered
with
pictures
painted
in
violent
hues
blues
and
reds
and
greens
jarring
against
one
another
and
lighting
up
the
gloom
of
the
place
the
stone
benches
were
always
crowded
the
sunlight
came
in
through
the
door
in
a
long
bright
beam
casting
a
dancing
shadow
of
vine
leaves
on
the
further
wall
there
a
painter
had
made
a
joyous
figure
of
the
young
bacchus
driving
the
leopards
before
him
with
his
and
the
quivering
shadow
seemed
a
part
of
the
picture
the
room
was
cool
and
dark
and
cavernous
but
the
scent
and
heat
of
the
summer
gushed
in
through
the
open
door
there
was
ever
a
full
sound
with
noise
and
vehemence
there
and
the
rolling
music
of
the
latin
tongue
never
ceased
the
wine
of
the
siege
the
wine
that
we
saved
cried
one
look
for
the
jar
marked
you
will
be
glad
bring
me
the
wine
of
the
owl
face
let
us
have
the
wine
of
saturn
bridge
the
boys
who
served
brought
the
wine
in
dull
red
jars
that
struck
a
charming
note
against
their
white
robes
they
poured
out
the
violet
and
purple
and
golden
wine
with
calm
sweet
faces
as
if
they
were
assisting
in
the
mysteries
without
any
sign
that
they
heard
the
strange
words
that
flashed
from
side
to
side
the
cups
were
all
of
glass
some
were
of
deep
green
of
the
color
of
the
sea
near
the
land
flawed
and
specked
with
the
bubbles
of
the
furnace
others
were
of
brilliant
scarlet
streaked
with
irregular
bands
of
white
and
having
the
appearance
of
white
globules
in
the
molded
stem
there
were
cups
of
dark
glowing
blue
deeper
and
more
shining
than
the
blue
of
the
sky
and
running
through
the
substance
of
the
glass
were
veins
of
rich
gamboge
yellow
twining
from
the
brim
to
the
foot
some
cups
were
of
a
troubled
and
clotted
red
with
alternating
blotches
of
dark
and
light
some
were
variegated
with
white
and
yellow
stains
some
wore
a
film
of
rainbow
colours
some
glittered
shot
with
gold
threads
through
the
clear
crystal
some
were
as
if
sapphires
hung
suspended
in
running
water
some
sparkled
with
the
glint
of
stars
some
were
black
and
golden
like
tortoiseshell
a
strange
feature
was
the
constant
and
fluttering
motion
of
hands
and
arms
gesture
made
a
constant
commentary
on
speech
white
fingers
whiter
arms
and
sleeves
of
all
colours
hovered
restlessly
appeared
and
disappeared
with
an
effect
of
threads
crossing
and
on
the
loom
and
the
odor
of
the
place
was
both
curious
and
memorable
something
of
the
damp
cold
breath
of
the
cave
meeting
the
hot
blast
of
summer
the
strangely
mingled
aromas
of
rare
wines
as
they
fell
plashing
and
ringing
into
the
cups
the
drugged
vapor
of
the
east
that
the
priests
of
mithras
and
isis
bore
from
their
steaming
temples
these
were
always
strong
and
dominant
and
the
women
were
scented
sometimes
with
unctuous
and
overpowering
perfumes
and
to
the
artist
the
experiences
of
those
present
were
hinted
in
subtle
and
delicate
of
odor
they
drank
their
wine
and
caressed
all
day
in
the
tavern
the
women
threw
their
round
white
arms
about
their
lover
necks
they
intoxicated
them
with
the
scent
of
their
hair
the
priests
muttered
their
fantastic
jargon
of
theurgy
and
through
the
sonorous
clash
of
voices
there
always
seemed
the
ring
of
the
cry
look
for
the
jar
marked
you
will
be
glad
outside
the
vine
tendrils
shook
on
the
white
walls
glaring
in
the
sunshine
the
breeze
swept
up
from
the
yellow
river
pungent
with
the
salt
sea
savor
these
tavern
scenes
were
often
the
subject
of
lucian
meditation
as
he
sat
amongst
the
cushions
on
the
marble
seat
the
rich
sound
of
the
voices
impressed
him
above
all
things
and
he
saw
that
words
have
a
far
higher
reason
than
the
utilitarian
office
of
imparting
a
man
thought
the
common
notion
that
language
and
linked
words
are
important
only
as
a
means
of
expression
he
found
a
little
ridiculous
as
if
electricity
were
to
be
studied
solely
with
the
view
of
wiring
to
people
and
all
its
other
properties
left
unexplored
neglected
language
he
understood
was
chiefly
important
for
the
beauty
of
its
sounds
by
its
possession
of
words
resonant
glorious
to
the
ear
by
its
capacity
when
exquisitely
arranged
of
suggesting
wonderful
and
indefinable
impressions
perhaps
more
ravishing
and
farther
removed
from
the
domain
of
strict
thought
than
the
impressions
excited
by
music
itself
here
lay
hidden
the
secret
of
the
sensuous
art
of
literature
it
was
the
secret
of
suggestion
the
art
of
causing
delicious
sensation
by
the
use
of
words
in
a
way
therefore
literature
was
independent
of
thought
the
mere
english
listener
if
he
had
an
ear
attuned
could
recognize
the
beauty
of
a
splendid
latin
phrase
here
was
the
explanation
of
the
magic
of
from
the
standpoint
of
the
formal
understanding
it
was
an
affected
lament
over
some
wholly
uninteresting
and
unimportant
king
it
was
full
of
nonsense
about
shepherds
and
flocks
and
muses
and
such
stale
stock
of
poetry
the
introduction
of
st
peter
on
a
stage
thronged
with
nymphs
and
river
gods
was
blasphemous
absurd
and
in
the
worst
taste
there
were
touches
of
greasy
puritanism
the
twang
of
the
conventicle
was
only
too
apparent
and
was
probably
the
most
perfect
piece
of
pure
literature
in
existence
because
every
word
and
phrase
and
line
were
sonorous
ringing
and
echoing
with
music
literature
he
in
his
mind
is
the
sensuous
art
of
causing
exquisite
impressions
by
means
of
words
and
yet
there
was
something
more
besides
the
logical
thought
which
was
often
a
hindrance
a
troublesome
though
inseparable
accident
besides
the
sensation
always
a
pleasure
and
a
delight
besides
these
there
were
the
indefinable
inexpressible
images
which
all
fine
literature
summons
to
the
mind
as
the
chemist
in
his
experiments
is
sometimes
astonished
to
find
unknown
unexpected
elements
in
the
crucible
or
the
receiver
as
the
world
of
material
things
is
considered
by
some
a
thin
veil
of
the
immaterial
universe
so
he
who
reads
wonderful
prose
or
verse
is
conscious
of
suggestions
that
can
not
be
put
into
words
which
do
not
rise
from
the
logical
sense
which
are
rather
parallel
to
than
connected
with
the
sensuous
delight
the
world
so
disclosed
is
rather
the
world
of
dreams
rather
the
world
in
which
children
sometimes
live
instantly
appearing
and
instantly
vanishing
away
a
world
beyond
all
expression
or
analysis
neither
of
the
intellect
nor
of
the
senses
he
called
these
fancies
of
his
meditations
of
a
tavern
and
was
amused
to
think
that
a
theory
of
letters
should
have
risen
from
the
eloquent
noise
that
rang
all
day
about
the
violet
and
golden
wine
let
us
seek
for
more
exquisite
things
said
lucian
to
himself
he
could
almost
imagine
the
magic
transmutation
of
the
senses
accomplished
the
strong
sunlight
was
an
odor
in
his
nostrils
it
poured
down
on
the
white
marble
and
the
palpitating
roses
like
a
flood
the
sky
was
a
glorious
blue
making
the
heart
joyous
and
the
eyes
could
rest
in
the
dark
green
leaves
and
purple
shadow
of
the
ilex
the
earth
seemed
to
burn
and
leap
beneath
the
sun
he
fancied
he
could
see
the
vine
tendrils
stir
and
quiver
in
the
heat
and
the
faint
fume
of
the
scorching
pine
needles
was
blown
across
the
gleaming
garden
to
the
seat
beneath
the
porch
wine
was
before
him
in
a
cup
of
carved
amber
a
wine
of
the
color
of
a
dark
rose
with
a
glint
as
of
a
star
or
of
a
jet
of
flame
deep
beneath
the
brim
and
the
cup
was
twined
about
with
a
delicate
wreath
of
ivy
he
was
often
loath
to
turn
away
from
the
still
contemplation
of
such
things
from
the
mere
joy
of
the
violent
sun
and
the
responsive
earth
he
loved
his
garden
and
the
view
of
the
tessellated
city
from
the
vineyard
on
the
hill
the
strange
clamor
of
the
tavern
and
white
fotis
appearing
on
the
stage
and
there
were
shops
in
the
town
in
which
he
delighted
the
shops
of
the
perfume
makers
and
jewelers
and
dealers
in
curious
ware
he
loved
to
see
all
things
made
for
ladies
use
to
touch
the
gossamer
silks
that
were
to
touch
their
bodies
to
finger
the
beads
of
amber
and
the
gold
chains
which
would
stir
above
their
hearts
to
handle
the
carved
hairpins
and
brooches
to
smell
odors
which
were
already
dedicated
to
love
but
though
these
were
sweet
and
delicious
gratifications
he
knew
that
there
were
more
exquisite
things
of
which
he
might
be
a
spectator
he
had
seen
the
folly
of
regarding
fine
literature
from
the
standpoint
of
the
logical
intellect
and
he
now
began
to
question
the
wisdom
of
looking
at
life
as
if
it
were
a
moral
representation
literature
he
knew
could
not
exist
without
some
meaning
and
considerations
of
right
and
wrong
were
to
a
certain
extent
inseparable
from
the
conception
of
life
but
to
insist
on
ethics
as
the
chief
interest
of
the
human
pageant
was
surely
absurd
one
might
as
well
read
for
the
sake
of
its
denunciation
of
our
corrupted
clergy
or
homer
for
manners
and
customs
an
artist
entranced
by
a
beautiful
landscape
did
not
greatly
concern
himself
with
the
geological
formation
of
the
hills
nor
did
the
lover
of
a
wild
sea
inquire
as
to
the
chemical
analysis
of
the
water
lucian
saw
a
colored
and
complex
life
displayed
before
him
and
he
sat
enraptured
at
the
spectacle
not
concerned
to
know
whether
actions
were
good
or
bad
but
content
if
they
were
curious
in
this
spirit
he
made
a
singular
study
of
corruption
beneath
his
feet
as
he
sat
in
the
garden
porch
was
a
block
of
marble
through
which
there
ran
a
scarlet
stain
it
began
with
a
faint
line
thin
as
a
hair
and
grew
as
it
advanced
sending
out
offshoots
to
right
and
left
and
broadening
to
a
pool
of
brilliant
red
there
were
strange
lives
into
which
he
looked
that
were
like
the
block
of
marble
women
with
grave
sweet
faces
told
him
the
astounding
tale
of
their
adventures
and
how
they
said
they
had
met
the
faun
when
they
were
little
children
they
told
him
how
they
had
played
and
watched
by
the
vines
and
the
fountains
and
dallied
with
the
nymphs
and
gazed
at
images
reflected
in
the
water
pools
till
the
authentic
face
appeared
from
the
wood
he
heard
others
tell
how
they
had
loved
the
satyrs
for
many
years
before
they
knew
their
race
and
there
were
strange
stories
of
those
who
had
longed
to
speak
but
knew
not
the
word
of
the
enigma
and
searched
in
all
strange
paths
and
ways
before
they
found
it
he
heard
the
history
of
the
woman
who
fell
in
love
with
her
and
tempted
him
for
three
years
in
vain
he
heard
the
tale
from
the
woman
full
red
lips
and
watched
her
face
full
of
the
ineffable
sadness
of
lust
as
she
described
her
curious
stratagems
in
mellow
phrases
she
was
drinking
a
sweet
yellow
wine
from
a
gold
cup
as
she
spoke
and
the
odor
in
her
hair
and
the
aroma
of
the
precious
wine
seemed
to
mingle
with
the
soft
strange
words
that
flowed
like
an
unguent
from
a
carven
jar
she
told
how
she
bought
the
boy
in
the
market
of
an
asian
city
and
had
him
carried
to
her
house
in
the
grove
of
then
she
went
on
he
was
led
into
my
presence
as
i
sat
between
the
columns
of
my
court
a
blue
veil
was
spread
above
to
shut
out
the
heat
of
the
sun
and
rather
twilight
than
light
shone
on
the
painted
walls
and
the
wonderful
colours
of
the
pavement
and
the
images
of
love
and
the
mother
of
love
the
men
who
brought
the
boy
gave
him
over
to
my
girls
who
undressed
him
before
me
one
drawing
gently
away
his
robe
another
stroking
his
brown
and
flowing
hair
another
praising
the
whiteness
of
his
limbs
and
another
caressing
him
and
speaking
loving
words
in
his
hear
but
the
boy
looked
sullenly
at
them
all
striking
away
their
hands
and
pouting
with
his
lovely
and
splendid
lips
and
i
saw
a
blush
like
the
rosy
veil
of
dawn
reddening
his
body
and
his
cheeks
then
i
made
them
bathe
him
and
anoint
him
with
scented
oils
from
head
to
foot
till
his
limbs
shone
and
glistened
with
the
gentle
and
mellow
glow
of
an
ivory
statue
then
i
said
are
bashful
because
you
shine
alone
amongst
us
all
see
we
too
will
be
your
fellows
the
girls
began
first
of
all
fondling
and
kissing
one
another
and
doing
for
each
other
the
offices
of
they
drew
out
the
pins
and
loosened
the
bands
of
their
hair
and
i
never
knew
before
that
they
were
so
lovely
the
soft
and
shining
tresses
flowed
down
rippling
like
some
had
hair
golden
and
radiant
as
this
wine
in
my
cup
the
faces
of
others
appeared
amidst
the
blackness
of
ebony
there
were
locks
that
seemed
of
burnished
and
scintillating
copper
some
glowed
with
hair
of
tawny
splendor
and
others
were
crowned
with
the
brightness
of
the
sardonyx
then
laughing
and
without
the
appearance
of
shame
they
unfastened
the
brooches
and
bands
which
sustained
their
robes
and
so
allowed
silk
and
linen
to
flow
swiftly
to
the
stained
floor
so
that
one
would
have
said
there
was
a
sudden
apparition
of
the
fairest
nymphs
with
many
festive
and
jocose
words
they
began
to
incite
each
other
to
mirth
praising
the
beauties
that
shone
on
every
side
and
calling
the
boy
by
a
girl
name
they
invited
him
to
be
their
playmate
but
he
refused
shaking
his
head
and
still
standing
and
abashed
as
if
he
saw
a
forbidden
and
terrible
spectacle
then
i
ordered
the
women
to
undo
my
hair
and
my
clothes
making
them
caress
me
with
the
tenderness
of
the
fondest
lover
but
without
avail
for
the
foolish
boy
still
scowled
and
pouted
out
his
lips
stained
with
an
imperial
and
glorious
scarlet
she
poured
out
more
of
the
wine
in
her
cup
and
lucian
saw
it
glitter
as
it
rose
to
the
brim
and
mirrored
the
gleam
of
the
lamps
the
tale
went
on
recounting
a
hundred
strange
devices
the
woman
told
how
she
had
tempted
the
boy
by
idleness
and
ease
giving
him
long
hours
of
sleep
and
allowing
him
to
recline
all
day
on
soft
cushions
that
swelled
about
him
enclosing
his
body
she
tried
the
experiment
of
curious
odors
causing
him
to
smell
always
about
him
the
oil
of
roses
and
burning
in
his
presence
rare
gums
from
the
east
he
was
allured
by
soft
dresses
being
clothed
in
silks
that
caressed
the
skin
with
the
sense
of
a
fondling
touch
three
times
a
day
they
spread
before
him
a
delicious
banquet
full
of
savor
and
odor
and
color
three
times
a
day
they
endeavored
to
intoxicate
him
with
delicate
wine
and
so
the
lady
continued
i
spared
nothing
to
catch
him
in
the
glistening
nets
of
love
taking
only
sour
and
contemptuous
glances
in
return
and
at
last
in
an
incredible
shape
i
won
the
victory
and
then
having
gained
a
green
crown
fighting
in
agony
against
his
green
and
crude
immaturity
i
devoted
him
to
the
theatre
where
he
amused
the
people
by
the
splendor
of
his
death
on
another
evening
he
heard
the
history
of
the
man
who
dwelt
alone
refusing
all
allurements
and
was
at
last
discovered
to
be
the
lover
of
a
black
statue
and
there
were
tales
of
strange
cruelties
of
men
taken
by
mountain
robbers
and
curiously
maimed
and
disfigured
so
that
when
they
escaped
and
returned
to
the
town
they
were
thought
to
be
monsters
and
killed
at
their
own
doors
lucian
left
no
dark
or
secret
nook
of
life
unvisited
he
sat
down
as
he
said
at
the
banquet
resolved
to
taste
all
the
savors
and
to
leave
no
flagon
unvisited
his
relations
grew
seriously
alarmed
about
him
at
this
period
while
he
heard
with
some
inner
ear
the
suave
and
eloquent
phrases
of
singular
tales
and
watched
the
in
amber
and
purple
wine
his
father
saw
a
lean
pale
boy
with
black
eyes
that
burnt
in
hollows
and
sad
and
sunken
cheeks
you
ought
to
try
and
eat
more
lucian
said
the
parson
and
why
you
have
some
beer
he
was
looking
feebly
at
the
roast
mutton
and
sipping
a
little
water
but
he
would
not
have
eaten
or
drunk
with
more
relish
if
the
choicest
meat
and
drink
had
been
before
him
his
bones
seemed
as
miss
deacon
said
to
be
growing
through
his
skin
he
had
all
the
appearance
of
an
ascetic
whose
body
has
been
reduced
to
misery
by
long
and
grievous
penance
people
who
chanced
to
see
him
could
not
help
saying
to
one
another
how
ill
and
wretched
that
lucian
taylor
looks
they
were
of
course
quite
unaware
of
the
joy
and
luxury
in
which
his
real
life
was
spent
and
some
of
them
began
to
pity
him
and
to
speak
to
him
kindly
it
was
too
late
for
that
the
friendly
words
had
as
much
lost
their
meaning
as
the
words
of
contempt
edward
dixon
hailed
him
cheerfully
in
the
street
one
day
come
in
to
my
den
wo
you
old
fellow
he
said
you
wo
see
the
pater
i
managed
to
bag
a
bottle
of
his
old
port
i
know
you
smoke
like
a
furnace
and
i
got
some
ripping
cigars
you
will
come
you
i
can
tell
you
the
pater
booze
is
first
rate
he
gently
declined
and
went
on
kindness
and
unkindness
pity
and
contempt
had
become
for
him
mere
phrases
he
could
not
have
distinguished
one
from
the
other
hebrew
and
chinese
hungarian
and
pushtu
would
be
pretty
much
alike
to
an
agricultural
laborer
if
he
cared
to
listen
he
might
detect
some
general
differences
in
sound
but
all
four
tongues
would
be
equally
devoid
of
significance
to
lucian
entranced
in
the
garden
of
avallaunius
it
seemed
very
strange
that
he
had
once
been
so
ignorant
of
all
the
exquisite
meanings
of
life
now
beneath
the
violet
sky
looking
through
the
brilliant
trellis
of
the
vines
he
saw
the
picture
before
he
had
gazed
in
sad
astonishment
at
the
squalid
rag
which
was
wrapped
about
it
v
and
he
was
at
last
in
the
city
of
the
unending
murmuring
streets
a
part
of
the
stirring
shadow
of
the
gloom
it
seemed
a
long
time
since
he
had
knelt
before
his
sweetheart
in
the
lane
the
streaming
upon
them
from
the
dark
circle
of
the
fort
the
air
and
the
light
and
his
soul
full
of
haunting
the
touch
of
the
unimaginable
thrilling
his
heart
and
now
he
sat
in
a
terrible
in
a
western
suburb
confronted
by
a
heap
and
litter
of
papers
on
the
desk
of
a
battered
old
bureau
he
had
put
his
out
on
the
landing
and
was
thinking
of
the
morning
work
and
of
some
very
dubious
pages
that
he
had
blackened
the
night
before
but
when
he
had
lit
his
disreputable
briar
he
remembered
there
was
an
unopened
letter
waiting
for
him
on
the
table
he
had
recognized
the
vague
staggering
script
of
miss
deacon
his
cousin
there
was
not
much
news
his
father
was
just
the
same
as
usual
there
had
been
a
good
deal
of
rain
the
farmers
expected
to
make
a
lot
of
cider
and
so
forth
but
at
the
close
of
the
letter
miss
deacon
became
useful
for
reproof
and
admonition
i
was
at
caermaen
on
tuesday
she
said
and
called
on
the
gervases
and
the
dixons
gervase
smiled
when
i
told
him
you
were
a
literary
man
living
in
london
and
said
he
was
afraid
you
would
find
it
a
very
practical
career
gervase
was
very
proud
of
henry
success
he
passed
fifth
for
some
examination
and
will
begin
with
nearly
four
hundred
a
year
i
do
wonder
the
gervases
are
delighted
then
i
went
to
the
dixons
and
had
tea
dixon
wanted
to
know
if
you
had
published
anything
yet
and
i
said
i
thought
not
she
showed
me
a
book
everybody
is
talking
about
called
the
and
the
she
says
it
selling
by
thousands
and
that
one
ca
take
up
a
paper
without
seeing
the
author
name
she
told
me
to
tell
you
that
you
ought
to
try
to
write
something
like
it
then
dixon
came
in
from
the
study
and
your
name
was
mentioned
again
he
said
he
was
afraid
you
had
made
rather
a
mistake
in
trying
to
take
up
literature
as
if
it
were
a
profession
and
seemed
to
think
that
a
place
in
a
house
of
business
would
be
more
and
more
practical
he
pointed
out
that
you
had
not
had
the
advantages
of
a
university
training
and
said
that
you
would
find
men
who
had
made
good
friends
and
had
the
of
the
university
would
be
before
you
at
every
step
he
said
edward
was
doing
very
well
at
oxford
he
writes
to
them
that
he
knows
several
noblemen
and
that
young
philip
bullingham
son
of
sir
john
bullingham
is
his
most
intimate
friend
of
course
this
is
satisfactory
for
the
dixons
i
am
afraid
my
dear
lucian
you
have
rather
overrated
your
powers
would
it
be
better
even
now
to
look
out
for
some
to
do
instead
of
wasting
your
time
over
those
silly
old
books
i
know
quite
well
how
the
gervases
and
the
dixons
feel
they
think
idleness
so
injurious
for
a
young
man
and
likely
to
lead
to
you
know
my
dear
lucian
i
am
only
writing
like
this
because
of
my
affection
for
you
so
i
am
sure
my
dear
boy
you
wo
be
offended
lucian
the
letter
solemnly
in
the
receptacle
lettered
barbarians
he
felt
that
he
ought
to
ask
himself
some
serious
questions
why
have
i
passed
fifth
why
is
philip
son
of
sir
john
my
most
intimate
friend
why
am
i
an
idler
liable
to
fall
into
bad
habits
but
he
was
eager
to
get
to
his
work
a
curious
and
intricate
piece
of
analysis
so
the
battered
bureau
the
litter
of
papers
and
the
thick
fume
of
his
pipe
engulfed
him
and
absorbed
him
for
the
rest
of
the
morning
outside
were
the
dim
october
mists
the
dreary
and
languid
life
of
a
side
street
and
beyond
on
the
main
road
the
hum
and
jangle
of
the
gliding
trains
but
he
heard
none
of
the
uneasy
noises
of
the
quarter
not
even
the
shriek
of
the
garden
gates
nor
the
yelp
of
the
butcher
on
his
round
for
delight
in
his
great
task
made
him
unconscious
of
the
world
outside
he
had
come
by
curious
paths
to
this
calm
hermitage
between
bush
and
acton
vale
the
golden
weeks
of
the
summer
passed
on
in
their
enchanted
procession
and
annie
had
not
returned
neither
had
she
written
lucian
on
his
side
sat
apart
wondering
why
his
longing
for
her
were
not
sharper
as
he
though
of
his
raptures
he
would
smile
faintly
to
himself
and
wonder
whether
he
had
not
lost
the
world
and
annie
with
it
in
the
garden
of
avallaunius
his
sense
of
external
things
had
grown
dim
and
indistinct
the
actual
material
life
seemed
every
day
to
become
a
show
a
fleeting
of
shadows
across
a
great
white
light
at
last
the
news
came
that
annie
morgan
had
been
married
from
her
sister
house
to
a
young
farmer
to
whom
it
appeared
she
had
been
long
engaged
and
lucian
was
ashamed
to
find
himself
only
conscious
of
amusement
mingled
with
gratitude
she
had
been
the
key
that
opened
the
shut
palace
and
he
was
now
secure
on
the
throne
of
ivory
and
gold
a
few
days
after
he
had
heard
the
news
he
repeated
the
adventure
of
his
boyhood
for
the
second
time
he
scaled
the
steep
hillside
and
penetrated
the
matted
brake
he
expected
violent
disillusion
but
his
feeling
was
rather
astonishment
at
the
activity
of
boyish
imagination
there
was
no
terror
nor
amazement
now
in
the
green
bulwarks
and
the
stunted
undergrowth
did
not
seem
in
any
way
extraordinary
yet
he
did
not
laugh
at
the
memory
of
his
sensations
he
was
not
angry
at
the
cheat
certainly
it
had
been
all
illusion
all
the
heats
and
chills
of
boyhood
its
thoughts
of
terror
were
without
significance
but
he
recognized
that
the
illusions
of
the
child
only
differed
from
those
of
the
man
in
that
they
were
more
picturesque
belief
in
fairies
and
belief
in
the
stock
exchange
as
bestowers
of
happiness
were
equally
vain
but
the
latter
form
of
faith
was
ugly
as
well
as
inept
it
was
better
he
knew
and
wiser
to
wish
for
a
fairy
coach
than
to
cherish
longings
for
a
brougham
and
liveried
servants
he
turned
his
back
on
the
green
walls
and
the
dark
oaks
without
any
feeling
of
regret
or
resentment
after
a
little
while
he
began
to
think
of
his
adventures
with
pleasure
the
ladder
by
which
he
had
mounted
had
disappeared
but
he
was
safe
on
the
height
by
the
chance
fancy
of
a
beautiful
girl
he
had
been
redeemed
from
a
world
of
misery
and
torture
the
world
of
external
things
into
which
he
had
come
a
stranger
by
which
he
had
been
tormented
he
looked
back
at
a
kind
of
vision
of
himself
seen
as
he
was
a
year
before
a
pitiable
creature
burning
and
twisting
on
the
hot
coals
of
the
pit
crying
lamentably
to
the
laughing
bystanders
for
but
one
drop
of
cold
water
wherewith
to
cool
his
tongue
he
confessed
to
himself
with
some
contempt
that
he
had
been
a
social
being
depending
for
his
happiness
on
the
goodwill
of
others
he
had
tried
hard
to
write
chiefly
it
was
true
from
love
of
the
art
but
a
little
from
a
social
motive
he
had
imagined
that
a
written
book
and
the
praise
of
responsible
journals
would
ensure
him
the
respect
of
the
county
people
it
was
a
quaint
idea
and
he
saw
the
lamentable
fallacies
naked
in
the
first
place
a
painstaking
artist
in
words
was
not
respected
by
the
respectable
secondly
books
should
not
be
written
with
the
object
of
gaining
the
goodwill
of
the
landed
and
commercial
interests
thirdly
and
chiefly
no
man
should
in
any
way
depend
on
another
from
this
utter
darkness
from
danger
of
madness
the
ever
dear
and
sweet
annie
had
rescued
him
very
beautifully
and
fitly
as
lucian
thought
she
had
done
her
work
without
any
desire
to
benefit
him
she
had
simply
willed
to
gratify
her
own
passion
and
in
doing
this
had
handed
to
him
the
priceless
secret
and
he
on
his
side
had
reversed
the
process
merely
to
make
himself
a
splendid
offering
for
the
acceptance
of
his
sweetheart
he
had
cast
aside
the
vain
world
and
had
found
the
truth
which
now
remained
with
him
precious
and
enduring
and
since
the
news
of
the
marriage
he
found
that
his
worship
of
her
had
by
no
means
vanished
rather
in
his
heart
was
the
eternal
treasure
of
a
happy
love
untarnished
and
spotless
it
would
be
like
a
mirror
of
gold
without
alloy
bright
and
lustrous
for
ever
for
lucian
it
was
no
defect
in
the
woman
that
she
was
desirous
and
faithless
he
had
not
conceived
an
affection
for
certain
moral
or
intellectual
accidents
but
for
the
very
woman
guided
by
the
axiom
that
humanity
is
to
be
judged
by
literature
and
not
literature
by
humanity
he
detected
the
analogy
between
and
annie
only
the
dullard
would
object
to
the
nauseous
cant
of
the
one
or
to
the
indiscretions
of
the
other
a
sober
critic
might
say
that
the
man
who
could
generalize
herbert
and
laud
donne
and
herrick
sanderson
and
juxon
hammond
and
lancelot
andrewes
into
our
corrupted
clergy
must
be
either
an
imbecile
or
a
scoundrel
or
probably
both
the
judgment
would
be
perfectly
true
but
as
a
criticism
of
it
would
be
a
piece
of
folly
in
the
case
of
the
woman
one
could
imagine
the
attitude
of
the
conventional
lover
of
the
chevalier
who
with
his
tongue
in
his
cheek
reverences
and
respects
all
women
and
coming
home
early
in
the
morning
writes
a
leading
article
on
st
english
girl
lucian
on
the
other
hand
felt
profoundly
grateful
to
the
delicious
annie
because
she
had
at
precisely
the
right
moment
voluntarily
removed
her
image
from
his
way
he
confessed
to
himself
that
latterly
he
had
a
little
dreaded
her
return
as
an
interruption
he
had
shivered
at
the
thought
that
their
relations
would
become
what
was
so
terribly
called
an
intrigue
or
affair
there
would
be
all
the
threadbare
and
common
stratagems
the
vulgarity
of
secret
assignations
and
an
atmosphere
suggesting
the
period
of
thomas
moore
and
lord
byron
and
segars
lucian
had
been
afraid
of
all
this
he
had
feared
lest
love
itself
should
destroy
love
he
considered
that
now
freed
from
the
torment
of
the
body
leaving
untasted
the
green
water
that
makes
thirst
more
burning
he
was
perfectly
initiated
in
the
true
knowledge
of
the
splendid
and
glorious
love
there
seemed
to
him
a
monstrous
paradox
in
the
assertion
that
there
could
be
no
true
love
without
a
corporal
presence
of
the
beloved
even
the
popular
sayings
of
absence
makes
the
heart
grow
fonder
and
familiarity
breeds
contempt
witnessed
to
the
contrary
he
thought
sighing
and
with
compassion
of
the
manner
in
which
men
are
continually
led
astray
by
the
cheat
of
the
senses
in
order
that
the
unborn
might
still
be
added
to
the
born
nature
had
inspired
men
with
the
wild
delusion
that
the
bodily
companionship
of
the
lover
and
the
beloved
was
desirable
above
all
things
and
so
by
the
false
show
of
pleasure
the
human
race
was
chained
to
vanity
and
doomed
to
an
eternal
thirst
for
the
again
and
again
he
gave
thanks
for
his
own
escape
he
had
been
set
free
from
a
life
of
vice
and
sin
and
folly
from
all
the
dangers
and
illusions
that
are
most
dreaded
by
the
wise
he
laughed
as
he
remembered
what
would
be
the
common
view
of
the
situation
an
ordinary
lover
would
suffer
all
the
sting
of
sorrow
and
contempt
there
would
be
grief
for
a
lost
mistress
and
rage
at
her
faithlessness
and
hate
in
the
heart
one
foolish
passion
driving
on
another
and
driving
the
man
to
ruin
for
what
would
be
commonly
called
the
real
woman
he
now
cared
nothing
if
he
had
heard
that
she
had
died
in
her
farm
in
utter
gwent
he
would
have
experienced
only
a
passing
sorrow
such
as
he
might
feel
at
the
death
of
any
one
he
had
once
known
but
he
did
not
think
of
the
young
wife
as
the
real
annie
he
did
not
think
of
the
leaves
in
winter
as
the
real
rose
indeed
the
life
of
many
reminded
him
of
the
flowers
perhaps
more
especially
of
those
flowers
which
to
all
appearance
are
for
many
years
but
dull
and
dusty
clumps
of
green
and
suddenly
in
one
night
burst
into
the
flame
of
blossom
and
fill
all
the
misty
lawns
with
odor
till
the
morning
it
was
in
that
night
that
the
flower
lived
not
through
the
long
unprofitable
years
and
in
like
manner
many
human
lives
he
thought
were
born
in
the
evening
and
dead
before
the
coming
of
day
but
he
had
preserved
the
precious
flower
in
all
its
glory
not
suffering
it
to
wither
in
the
hard
light
but
keeping
it
in
a
secret
place
where
it
could
never
be
destroyed
truly
now
and
for
the
first
time
he
possessed
annie
as
a
man
possesses
the
gold
which
he
has
dug
from
the
rock
and
purged
of
its
baseness
he
was
musing
over
these
things
when
a
piece
of
news
very
strange
and
unexpected
arrived
at
the
rectory
a
distant
almost
a
mythical
relative
known
from
childhood
as
cousin
edward
in
the
isle
of
wight
had
died
and
by
some
strange
freak
had
left
lucian
two
thousand
pounds
it
was
a
pleasure
to
give
his
father
five
hundred
pounds
and
the
rector
on
his
side
forgot
for
a
couple
of
days
to
lean
his
head
on
his
hand
from
the
rest
of
the
capital
which
was
well
invested
lucian
found
he
would
derive
something
between
sixty
and
seventy
pounds
a
year
and
his
old
desires
for
literature
and
a
refuge
in
the
murmuring
streets
returned
to
him
he
longed
to
be
free
from
the
incantations
that
surrounded
him
in
the
country
to
work
and
live
in
a
new
atmosphere
and
so
with
many
good
wishes
from
his
father
he
came
to
the
retreat
in
the
waste
places
of
london
he
was
in
high
spirits
when
he
found
the
square
clean
room
horribly
furnished
in
the
that
branched
from
the
main
road
and
advanced
in
an
unlovely
sweep
to
the
mud
pits
and
the
desolation
that
was
neither
town
nor
country
on
every
side
monotonous
grey
streets
each
house
the
replica
of
its
neighbor
to
the
east
an
unexplored
wilderness
north
and
west
and
south
the
brickfields
and
everywhere
the
ruins
of
the
country
the
tracks
where
sweet
lanes
had
been
gangrened
stumps
of
trees
the
relics
of
hedges
here
and
there
an
oak
stripped
of
its
bark
white
and
haggard
and
leprous
like
a
corpse
and
the
air
seemed
always
grey
and
the
smoke
from
the
brickfields
was
grey
at
first
he
scarcely
realized
the
quarter
into
which
chance
had
led
him
his
only
thought
was
of
the
great
adventure
of
letters
in
which
he
proposed
to
engage
and
his
first
glance
round
his
showed
him
that
there
was
no
piece
of
furniture
suitable
for
his
purpose
the
table
like
the
rest
of
the
suite
was
of
maple
but
the
maker
seemed
to
have
penetrated
the
druidic
secret
of
the
the
thing
was
in
a
state
of
unstable
equilibrium
perpetually
for
some
days
he
wandered
through
the
streets
inspecting
the
furniture
shops
and
at
last
in
a
forlorn
byway
found
an
old
japanese
bureau
dishonored
and
forlorn
standing
amongst
rusty
bedsteads
sorry
china
and
all
the
refuse
of
homes
dead
and
desolate
the
bureau
pleased
him
in
spite
of
its
grime
and
grease
and
dirt
inlaid
the
gleam
of
lacquer
dragons
in
red
gold
and
hints
of
curious
design
shone
through
the
film
of
neglect
and
and
when
the
woman
of
the
shop
showed
him
the
drawers
and
well
and
he
saw
that
it
would
be
an
apt
instrument
for
his
studies
the
bureau
was
carried
to
his
room
and
replaced
the
table
under
the
as
lucian
arranged
what
papers
he
had
accumulated
the
sketches
of
hopeless
experiments
shreds
and
tatters
of
stories
begun
but
never
completed
outlines
of
plots
two
or
three
notebooks
scribbled
through
and
through
with
impressions
of
the
abandoned
hills
he
felt
a
thrill
of
exaltation
at
the
prospect
of
work
to
be
accomplished
of
a
new
world
all
open
before
him
he
set
out
on
the
adventure
with
a
fury
of
enthusiasm
his
last
thought
at
night
when
all
the
maze
of
streets
was
empty
and
silent
was
of
the
problem
and
his
dreams
ran
on
phrases
and
when
he
awoke
in
the
morning
he
was
eager
to
get
back
to
his
desk
he
immersed
himself
in
a
minute
almost
a
microscopic
analysis
of
fine
literature
it
was
no
longer
enough
as
in
the
old
days
to
feel
the
charm
and
incantation
of
a
line
or
a
word
he
wished
to
penetrate
the
secret
to
understand
something
of
the
wonderful
suggestion
all
apart
from
the
sense
that
seemed
to
him
the
of
literature
as
distinguished
from
the
long
follies
of
psychological
analysis
and
all
the
stuff
that
went
to
make
the
novel
of
commerce
he
found
himself
curiously
strengthened
by
the
change
from
the
hills
to
the
streets
there
could
be
no
doubt
he
thought
that
living
a
lonely
life
interested
only
in
himself
and
his
own
thoughts
he
had
become
in
a
measure
inhuman
the
form
of
external
things
black
depths
in
woods
pools
in
lonely
places
those
still
valleys
curtained
by
hills
on
every
side
sounding
always
with
the
ripple
of
their
brooks
had
become
to
him
an
influence
like
that
of
a
drug
giving
a
certain
peculiar
color
and
outline
to
his
thoughts
and
from
early
boyhood
there
had
been
another
strange
flavor
in
his
life
the
dream
of
the
old
roman
world
those
curious
impressions
that
he
had
gathered
from
the
white
walls
of
caermaen
and
from
the
looming
bastions
of
the
fort
it
was
in
reality
the
subconscious
fancies
of
many
years
that
had
rebuilt
the
golden
city
and
had
shown
him
the
and
the
marbles
and
the
sunlight
in
the
garden
of
avallaunius
and
the
rapture
of
love
had
made
it
all
so
vivid
and
warm
with
life
that
even
now
when
he
let
his
pen
drop
the
rich
noise
of
the
tavern
and
the
chant
of
the
theatre
sounded
above
the
murmur
of
the
streets
looking
back
it
was
as
much
a
part
of
his
life
as
his
schooldays
and
the
tessellated
pavements
were
as
real
as
the
square
of
faded
carpet
beneath
his
feet
but
he
felt
that
he
had
escaped
he
could
now
survey
those
splendid
and
lovely
visions
from
without
as
if
he
read
of
opium
dreams
and
he
no
longer
dreaded
a
weird
suggestion
that
had
once
beset
him
that
his
very
soul
was
being
molded
into
the
hills
and
passing
into
the
black
mirror
of
still
waterpools
he
had
taken
refuge
in
the
streets
in
the
harbor
of
a
modern
suburb
from
the
vague
dreaded
magic
that
had
charmed
his
life
whenever
he
felt
inclined
to
listen
to
the
old
or
to
the
singing
of
the
fauns
he
bent
more
earnestly
to
his
work
turning
a
deaf
ear
to
the
incantations
in
the
curious
labor
of
the
bureau
he
found
refreshment
that
was
continually
renewed
he
experienced
again
and
with
a
far
more
violent
impulse
the
enthusiasm
that
had
attended
the
writing
of
his
book
a
year
or
two
before
and
so
perhaps
passed
from
one
drug
to
another
it
was
indeed
with
something
of
rapture
that
he
imagined
the
great
procession
of
years
all
to
be
devoted
to
the
intimate
analysis
of
words
to
the
construction
of
the
sentence
as
if
it
were
a
piece
of
jewelry
or
mosaic
sometimes
in
the
pauses
of
the
work
he
would
pace
up
and
down
his
cell
looking
out
of
the
window
now
and
again
and
gazing
for
an
instant
into
the
melancholy
street
as
the
year
advanced
the
days
grew
more
and
more
misty
and
he
found
himself
the
inhabitant
of
a
little
island
wreathed
about
with
the
waves
of
a
white
and
solemn
sea
in
the
afternoon
the
fog
would
grow
denser
shutting
out
not
only
sight
but
sound
the
shriek
of
the
garden
gates
the
jangling
of
the
echoed
as
if
from
a
far
way
then
there
were
days
of
heavy
incessant
rain
he
could
see
a
grey
drifting
sky
and
the
drops
plashing
in
the
street
and
the
houses
all
dripping
and
saddened
with
wet
he
cured
himself
of
one
great
aversion
he
was
no
longer
nauseated
at
the
sight
of
a
story
begun
and
left
unfinished
formerly
even
when
an
idea
rose
in
his
mind
bright
and
wonderful
he
had
always
approached
the
paper
with
a
feeling
of
sickness
and
dislike
remembering
all
the
hopeless
beginnings
he
had
made
but
now
he
understood
that
to
begin
a
romance
was
almost
a
separate
and
special
art
a
thing
apart
from
the
story
to
be
practiced
with
sedulous
care
whenever
an
opening
scene
occurred
to
him
he
noted
it
roughly
in
a
book
and
he
devoted
many
long
winter
evenings
to
the
elaboration
of
these
beginnings
sometimes
the
first
impression
would
yield
only
a
paragraph
or
a
sentence
and
once
or
twice
but
a
splendid
and
sonorous
word
which
seemed
to
lucian
all
dim
and
rich
with
unsurmised
adventure
but
often
he
was
able
to
write
three
or
four
vivid
pages
studying
above
all
things
the
hint
and
significance
of
the
words
and
actions
striving
to
work
into
the
lines
the
atmosphere
of
expectation
and
promise
and
the
murmur
of
wonderful
events
to
come
in
this
one
department
of
his
task
the
labor
seemed
almost
endless
he
would
finish
a
few
pages
and
then
rewrite
them
using
the
same
incident
and
nearly
the
same
words
but
altering
that
indefinite
something
which
is
scarcely
so
much
style
as
manner
or
atmosphere
he
was
astonished
at
the
enormous
change
that
was
thus
effected
and
often
though
he
himself
had
done
the
work
he
could
scarcely
describe
in
words
how
it
was
done
but
it
was
clear
that
in
this
art
of
manner
or
suggestion
lay
all
the
chief
secrets
of
literature
that
by
it
all
the
great
miracles
were
performed
clearly
it
was
not
style
for
style
in
itself
was
untranslatable
but
it
was
that
high
theurgic
magic
that
made
the
english
roughly
traduced
by
some
jervas
perhaps
the
best
of
all
english
books
and
it
was
the
same
element
that
made
the
journey
of
roderick
random
to
london
so
ostensibly
a
narrative
of
coarse
jokes
and
common
experiences
and
burlesque
manners
told
in
no
very
choice
diction
essentially
a
wonderful
vision
of
the
eighteenth
century
carrying
to
one
very
nostrils
the
aroma
of
the
great
north
road
under
black
frost
darkened
beneath
shuddering
woods
haunted
by
highwaymen
with
an
adventure
waiting
beyond
every
turn
and
great
old
echoing
inns
in
the
midst
of
lonely
winter
lands
it
was
this
magic
that
lucian
sought
for
his
opening
chapters
he
tried
to
find
that
quality
that
gives
to
words
something
beyond
their
sound
and
beyond
their
meaning
that
in
the
first
lines
of
a
book
should
whisper
things
unintelligible
but
all
significant
often
he
worked
for
many
hours
without
success
and
the
grim
wet
dawn
once
found
him
still
searching
for
hieroglyphic
sentences
for
words
mystical
symbolic
on
the
shelves
in
the
upper
part
of
his
bureau
he
had
placed
the
books
which
however
various
as
to
matter
seemed
to
have
a
part
in
this
curious
quality
of
suggestion
and
in
that
sphere
which
might
almost
be
called
supernatural
to
these
books
he
often
had
recourse
when
further
effort
appeared
altogether
hopeless
and
certain
pages
in
coleridge
and
edgar
allan
poe
had
the
power
of
holding
him
in
a
trance
of
delight
subject
to
emotions
and
impressions
which
he
knew
to
transcend
altogether
the
realm
of
the
formal
understanding
such
lines
as
bottomless
vales
and
boundless
floods
and
chasms
and
caves
and
titan
woods
with
forms
that
no
man
can
discover
for
the
dews
that
drip
all
over
had
for
lucian
more
than
the
potency
of
a
drug
lulling
him
into
a
splendid
every
word
being
a
supreme
incantation
and
it
was
not
only
his
mind
that
was
charmed
by
such
passages
for
he
felt
at
the
same
time
a
strange
and
delicious
bodily
languor
that
held
him
motionless
without
the
desire
or
power
to
stir
from
his
seat
and
there
were
certain
phrases
in
that
had
such
a
magic
that
he
would
sometimes
wake
up
as
it
were
to
the
consciousness
that
he
had
been
lying
on
the
bed
or
sitting
in
the
chair
by
the
bureau
repeating
a
single
line
over
and
over
again
for
two
or
three
hours
yet
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
he
had
not
been
really
asleep
a
little
effort
recalled
a
constant
impression
of
the
with
its
pink
flowers
on
a
buff
ground
and
of
the
window
letting
in
the
grey
winter
light
he
had
been
some
seven
months
in
london
when
this
odd
experience
first
occurred
to
him
the
day
opened
dreary
and
cold
and
clear
with
a
gusty
and
restless
wind
whirling
round
the
corner
of
the
street
and
lifting
the
dead
leaves
and
scraps
of
paper
that
littered
the
roadway
into
eddying
mounting
circles
as
if
a
storm
of
black
rain
were
to
come
lucian
had
sat
late
the
night
before
and
rose
in
the
morning
feeling
weary
and
listless
and
while
he
dressed
his
legs
dragged
him
as
with
weights
and
he
staggered
and
nearly
fell
in
bending
down
to
the
mat
outside
for
his
he
lit
the
spirit
lamp
on
the
hearth
with
shaking
unsteady
hands
and
could
scarcely
pour
out
the
tea
when
it
was
ready
a
delicate
cup
of
tea
was
one
of
his
few
luxuries
he
was
fond
of
the
strange
flavor
of
the
green
leaf
and
this
morning
he
drank
the
liquid
eagerly
hoping
it
would
disperse
the
cloud
of
languor
he
tried
his
best
to
coerce
himself
into
the
sense
of
vigor
and
enjoyment
with
which
he
usually
began
the
day
walking
briskly
up
and
down
and
arranging
his
papers
in
order
but
he
could
not
free
himself
from
depression
even
as
he
opened
the
dear
bureau
a
wave
of
melancholy
came
upon
him
and
he
began
to
ask
himself
whether
he
were
not
pursuing
a
vain
dream
searching
for
treasures
that
had
no
existence
he
drew
out
his
cousin
letter
and
read
it
again
sadly
enough
after
all
there
was
a
good
deal
of
truth
in
what
she
said
he
had
overrated
his
powers
he
had
no
friends
no
real
education
he
began
to
count
up
the
months
since
he
had
come
to
london
he
had
received
his
two
thousand
pounds
in
march
and
in
may
he
had
said
to
the
woods
and
to
the
dear
and
friendly
paths
may
june
july
august
september
october
november
and
half
of
december
had
gone
by
and
what
had
he
to
show
nothing
but
the
experiment
the
attempt
futile
scribblings
which
had
no
end
nor
shining
purpose
there
was
nothing
in
his
desk
that
he
could
produce
as
evidence
of
his
capacity
no
fragment
even
of
accomplishment
it
was
a
thought
of
intense
bitterness
but
it
seemed
as
if
the
barbarians
were
in
the
right
a
place
in
a
house
of
business
would
have
been
more
suitable
he
leaned
his
head
on
his
desk
overwhelmed
with
the
severity
of
his
own
judgment
he
tried
to
comfort
himself
again
by
the
thought
of
all
the
hours
of
happy
enthusiasm
he
had
spent
amongst
his
papers
working
for
a
great
idea
with
infinite
patience
he
recalled
to
mind
something
that
he
had
always
tried
to
keep
in
the
background
of
his
hopes
the
of
his
life
which
he
had
hidden
out
of
sight
deep
in
his
heart
was
the
hope
that
he
might
one
day
write
a
valiant
book
he
scarcely
dared
to
entertain
the
aspiration
he
felt
his
incapacity
too
deeply
but
yet
this
longing
was
the
foundation
of
all
his
painful
and
patient
effort
this
he
had
proposed
in
secret
to
himself
that
if
he
labored
without
ceasing
without
tiring
he
might
produce
something
which
would
at
all
events
be
art
which
would
stand
wholly
apart
from
the
objects
shaped
like
books
printed
with
printers
ink
and
called
by
the
name
of
books
that
he
had
read
giotto
he
knew
was
a
painter
and
the
man
who
imitated
on
the
deal
doors
opposite
was
a
painter
and
he
had
wished
to
be
a
very
humble
pupil
in
the
class
of
the
former
it
was
better
he
thought
to
fail
in
attempting
exquisite
things
than
to
succeed
in
the
department
of
the
utterly
contemptible
he
had
vowed
he
would
be
the
dunce
of
cervantes
school
rather
than
in
the
academy
of
bad
un
to
and
and
with
this
purpose
he
had
devoted
himself
to
laborious
and
joyous
years
so
that
however
mean
his
capacity
the
pains
should
not
be
wanting
he
tried
now
to
rouse
himself
from
a
growing
misery
by
the
recollection
of
this
high
aim
but
it
all
seemed
hopeless
vanity
he
looked
out
into
the
grey
street
and
it
stood
a
symbol
of
his
life
chill
and
dreary
and
grey
and
vexed
with
a
horrible
wind
there
were
the
dull
inhabitants
of
the
quarter
going
about
their
common
business
a
man
was
crying
mackerel
in
a
doleful
voice
slowly
passing
up
the
street
and
staring
into
the
parlors
searching
for
the
face
of
a
purchaser
behind
the
plants
stuffed
birds
and
piles
of
gaudy
gilt
books
that
adorned
the
windows
one
of
the
blistered
doors
over
the
way
banged
and
a
woman
came
scurrying
out
on
some
errand
and
the
garden
gate
shrieked
two
melancholy
notes
as
she
opened
it
and
let
it
swing
back
after
her
the
little
patches
called
gardens
were
mostly
untilled
uncared
for
squares
of
slimy
moss
dotted
with
clumps
of
coarse
ugly
grass
but
here
and
there
were
the
blackened
and
rotting
remains
of
sunflowers
and
marigolds
and
beyond
he
knew
stretched
the
labyrinth
of
streets
more
or
less
squalid
but
all
grey
and
dull
and
behind
were
the
mud
pits
and
the
steaming
heaps
of
yellowish
bricks
and
to
the
north
was
a
great
wide
cold
waste
treeless
desolate
swept
by
bitter
wind
it
was
all
like
his
own
life
he
said
again
to
himself
a
maze
of
unprofitable
dreariness
and
desolation
and
his
mind
grew
as
black
and
hopeless
as
the
winter
sky
the
morning
went
thus
dismally
till
twelve
and
he
put
on
his
hat
and
he
always
went
out
for
an
hour
every
day
between
twelve
and
one
the
exercise
was
a
necessity
and
the
landlady
made
his
bed
in
the
interval
the
wind
blew
the
smoke
from
the
chimneys
into
his
face
as
he
shut
the
door
and
with
the
acrid
smoke
came
the
prevailing
odor
of
the
street
a
blend
of
and
burnt
bones
and
the
faint
sickly
vapor
from
the
brickfields
lucian
walked
mechanically
for
the
hour
going
eastward
along
the
main
road
the
wind
pierced
him
and
the
dust
was
blinding
and
the
dreariness
of
the
street
increased
his
misery
the
row
of
common
shops
full
of
common
things
the
blatant
the
independent
chapel
a
horrible
stucco
parody
of
a
greek
temple
with
a
façade
of
hideous
columns
that
was
a
nightmare
villas
like
smug
pharisees
shops
again
a
church
in
cheap
gothic
an
old
garden
blasted
and
riven
by
the
builder
these
were
the
pictures
of
the
way
when
he
got
home
again
he
flung
himself
on
the
bed
and
lay
there
stupidly
till
sheer
hunger
roused
him
he
ate
a
hunch
of
bread
and
drank
some
water
and
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
room
wondering
whether
there
were
no
escape
from
despair
writing
seemed
quite
impossible
and
hardly
knowing
what
he
did
he
opened
his
bureau
and
took
out
a
book
from
the
shelves
as
his
eyes
fell
on
the
page
the
air
grew
dark
and
heavy
as
night
and
the
wind
wailed
suddenly
loudly
terribly
by
woman
wailing
for
her
demon
lover
the
words
were
on
his
lips
when
he
raised
his
eyes
again
a
broad
band
of
pale
clear
light
was
shining
into
the
room
and
when
he
looked
out
of
the
window
he
saw
the
road
all
brightened
by
glittering
pools
of
water
and
as
the
last
drops
of
the
starred
these
mirrors
the
sun
sank
into
the
wrack
lucian
gazed
about
him
perplexed
till
his
eyes
fell
on
the
clock
above
his
empty
hearth
he
had
been
sitting
motionless
for
nearly
two
hours
without
any
sense
of
the
passage
of
time
and
without
ceasing
he
had
murmured
those
words
as
he
dreamed
an
endless
wonderful
story
he
experienced
somewhat
the
sensations
of
coleridge
himself
strange
amazing
ineffable
things
seemed
to
have
been
presented
to
him
not
in
the
form
of
the
idea
but
actually
and
materially
but
he
was
less
fortunate
than
coleridge
in
that
he
could
not
even
vaguely
image
to
himself
what
he
had
seen
yet
when
he
searched
his
mind
he
knew
that
the
consciousness
of
the
room
in
which
he
sat
had
never
left
him
he
had
seen
the
thick
darkness
gather
and
had
heard
the
whirl
of
rain
hissing
through
the
air
windows
had
been
shut
down
with
a
crash
he
had
noted
the
pattering
footsteps
of
people
running
to
shelter
the
voice
crying
to
some
one
to
look
at
the
rain
coming
in
under
the
door
it
was
like
peering
into
some
old
bituminous
picture
one
could
see
at
last
that
the
mere
blackness
resolved
itself
into
the
likeness
of
trees
and
rocks
and
travelers
and
against
this
background
of
his
room
and
the
storm
and
the
noises
of
the
street
his
vision
stood
out
illuminated
he
felt
he
had
descended
to
the
very
depths
into
the
caverns
that
are
hollowed
beneath
the
soul
he
tried
vainly
to
record
the
history
of
his
impressions
the
symbols
remained
in
his
memory
but
the
meaning
was
all
conjecture
the
next
morning
when
he
awoke
he
could
scarcely
understand
or
realize
the
bitter
depression
of
the
preceding
day
he
found
it
had
all
vanished
away
and
had
been
succeeded
by
an
intense
exaltation
afterwards
when
at
rare
intervals
he
experienced
the
same
strange
possession
of
the
consciousness
he
found
this
to
be
the
invariable
result
the
hour
of
vision
was
always
succeeded
by
a
feeling
of
delight
by
sensations
of
brightened
and
intensified
powers
on
that
bright
december
day
after
the
storm
he
rose
joyously
and
set
about
the
labor
of
the
bureau
with
the
assurance
of
success
almost
with
the
hope
of
formidable
difficulties
to
be
overcome
he
had
long
busied
himself
with
those
curious
researches
which
poe
had
indicated
in
the
of
and
many
hours
had
been
spent
in
analyzing
the
singular
effects
which
may
be
produced
by
the
sound
and
resonance
of
words
but
he
had
been
struck
by
the
thought
that
in
the
finest
literature
there
were
more
subtle
tones
than
the
loud
and
insistent
music
of
never
more
and
he
endeavored
to
find
the
secret
of
those
pages
and
sentences
which
spoke
less
directly
and
less
obviously
to
the
soul
rather
than
to
the
ear
being
filled
with
a
certain
grave
melody
and
the
sensation
of
singing
voices
it
was
admirable
no
doubt
to
write
phrases
that
showed
at
a
glance
their
designed
rhythm
and
rang
with
sonorous
words
but
he
dreamed
of
a
prose
in
which
the
music
should
be
less
explicit
of
names
rather
than
notes
he
was
astonished
that
morning
at
his
own
fortune
and
facility
he
succeeded
in
covering
a
page
of
ruled
paper
wholly
to
his
satisfaction
and
the
sentences
when
he
read
them
out
appeared
to
suggest
a
weird
elusive
chanting
exquisite
but
almost
imperceptible
like
the
echo
of
the
plainsong
reverberated
from
the
vault
of
a
monastic
church
he
thought
that
such
happy
mornings
well
repaid
him
for
the
anguish
of
depression
which
he
sometimes
had
to
suffer
and
for
the
strange
experience
of
possession
recurring
at
rare
intervals
and
usually
after
many
weeks
of
severe
diet
his
income
he
found
amounted
to
pounds
a
year
and
he
lived
for
weeks
at
a
time
on
fifteen
shillings
a
week
during
these
austere
periods
his
only
food
was
bread
at
the
rate
of
a
loaf
a
day
but
he
drank
huge
draughts
of
green
tea
and
smoked
a
black
tobacco
which
seemed
to
him
a
more
potent
mother
of
thought
than
any
drug
from
the
scented
east
i
hope
you
go
to
some
nice
place
for
dinner
wrote
his
cousin
there
used
to
be
some
excellent
in
london
where
one
could
get
a
good
cut
from
the
joint
plenty
of
and
a
boiled
potato
for
a
shilling
aunt
mary
writes
that
you
should
try
jones
in
water
street
islington
whose
father
came
from
near
caermaen
and
was
always
most
comfortable
in
her
day
i
daresay
the
walk
there
would
do
you
good
it
is
such
a
pity
you
smoke
that
horrid
tobacco
i
had
a
letter
from
dolly
jane
diggs
who
married
your
cousin
john
dolly
the
other
day
and
she
said
they
would
have
been
delighted
to
take
you
for
only
shillings
a
week
for
the
sake
of
the
family
if
you
had
not
been
a
smoker
she
told
me
to
ask
you
if
you
had
ever
seen
a
horse
or
a
dog
smoking
tobacco
they
are
such
nice
comfortable
people
and
the
children
would
have
been
company
for
you
johnnie
who
used
to
be
such
a
dear
little
fellow
has
just
gone
into
an
office
in
the
city
and
seems
to
have
excellent
prospects
how
i
wish
my
dear
lucian
that
you
could
do
something
in
the
same
way
do
forget
jones
in
water
street
and
you
might
mention
your
name
to
him
lucian
never
troubled
jones
but
these
letters
of
his
cousin
always
refreshed
him
by
the
force
of
contrast
he
tried
to
imagine
himself
a
part
of
the
dolly
family
going
dutifully
every
morning
to
the
city
on
the
bus
and
returning
in
the
evening
for
high
tea
he
could
conceive
the
fine
odor
of
hot
roast
beef
hanging
about
the
decorous
house
on
sunday
afternoons
papa
asleep
in
the
mamma
lying
down
and
the
children
quite
good
and
happy
with
their
sundays
books
in
the
evening
after
supper
one
read
the
till
bedtime
such
pictures
as
these
were
to
lucian
a
comfort
and
a
help
a
remedy
against
despair
often
when
he
felt
overwhelmed
by
the
difficulty
of
the
work
he
had
undertaken
he
thought
of
the
alternative
career
and
was
strengthened
he
returned
again
and
again
to
that
desire
of
a
prose
which
should
sound
faintly
not
so
much
with
an
audible
music
but
with
the
memory
and
echo
of
it
in
the
night
when
the
last
tram
had
gone
jangling
by
and
he
had
looked
out
and
seen
the
street
all
wrapped
about
in
heavy
folds
of
the
mist
he
conducted
some
of
his
most
delicate
experiments
in
that
white
and
solitary
midnight
of
the
suburban
street
he
experienced
the
curious
sense
of
being
on
a
tower
remote
and
apart
and
high
above
all
the
troubles
of
the
earth
the
gas
lamp
which
was
nearly
opposite
shone
in
a
pale
halo
of
light
and
the
houses
themselves
were
merely
indistinct
marks
and
shadows
amidst
that
palpable
whiteness
shutting
out
the
world
and
its
noises
the
knowledge
of
the
swarming
life
that
was
so
still
though
it
surrounded
him
made
the
silence
seem
deeper
than
that
of
the
mountains
before
the
dawn
it
was
as
if
he
alone
stirred
and
looked
out
amidst
a
host
sleeping
at
his
feet
the
fog
came
in
by
the
open
window
in
freezing
puffs
and
as
lucian
watched
he
noticed
that
it
shook
and
wavered
like
the
sea
tossing
up
wreaths
and
drifts
across
the
pale
halo
of
the
lamp
and
these
vanishing
others
succeeded
it
was
as
if
the
mist
passed
by
from
the
river
to
the
north
as
if
it
still
passed
by
in
the
silence
he
would
shut
his
window
gently
and
sit
down
in
his
lighted
room
with
all
the
consciousness
of
the
white
advancing
shroud
upon
him
it
was
then
that
he
found
himself
in
the
mood
for
curious
labors
and
able
to
handle
with
some
touch
of
confidence
the
more
exquisite
instruments
of
the
craft
he
sought
for
that
magic
by
which
all
the
glory
and
glamour
of
mystic
chivalry
were
made
to
shine
through
the
burlesque
and
gross
adventures
of
don
quixote
by
which
hawthorne
had
lit
his
infernal
sabbath
fires
and
fashioned
a
burning
aureole
about
the
village
tragedy
of
the
in
hawthorne
the
story
and
the
suggestion
though
quite
distinct
and
of
different
worlds
were
rather
parallel
than
opposed
to
one
another
but
cervantes
had
done
a
stranger
thing
one
read
of
don
quixote
beaten
dirty
and
ridiculous
mistaking
windmills
for
giants
sheep
for
an
army
but
the
impression
was
of
the
enchanted
forest
of
avalon
of
the
san
graal
far
in
the
spiritual
city
and
rabelais
showed
him
beneath
the
letter
the
tourainian
sun
shining
on
the
hot
rock
above
chinon
on
the
maze
of
narrow
climbing
streets
on
the
gabled
roofs
on
the
pricking
upward
from
the
fantastic
labyrinth
of
walls
he
heard
the
sound
of
sonorous
from
the
monastic
choir
of
gross
exuberant
gaiety
from
the
rich
vineyards
he
listened
to
the
eternal
mystic
mirth
of
those
that
halted
in
the
purple
shadow
of
the
by
the
white
steep
road
the
gracious
and
ornate
on
the
loire
and
the
vienne
rose
fair
and
shining
to
confront
the
incredible
secrets
of
vast
dim
gothic
naves
that
seemed
ready
to
take
the
great
deep
and
float
away
from
the
mist
and
dust
of
earthly
streets
to
anchor
in
the
haven
of
the
clear
city
that
hath
foundations
the
rank
tale
of
the
of
the
mingled
with
the
reasoned
endless
legend
of
the
schools
with
luminous
platonic
argument
the
old
pomp
of
the
middle
ages
put
on
the
robe
of
a
fresh
life
there
was
a
smell
of
wine
and
of
incense
of
june
meadows
and
of
ancient
books
and
through
it
all
he
hearkened
intent
to
the
exultation
of
chiming
bells
ringing
for
a
new
feast
in
a
new
land
he
would
cover
pages
with
the
analysis
of
these
marvels
tracking
the
suggestion
concealed
beneath
the
words
and
yet
glowing
like
the
golden
threads
in
a
robe
of
samite
or
like
that
device
of
the
old
binders
by
which
a
vivid
picture
appeared
on
the
shut
edges
of
a
book
he
tried
to
imitate
this
art
to
summon
even
the
faint
shadow
of
the
great
effect
rewriting
a
page
of
hawthorne
experimenting
and
changing
an
epithet
here
and
there
noting
how
sometimes
the
alteration
of
a
trifling
word
would
plunge
a
whole
scene
into
darkness
as
if
one
of
those
fires
had
instantly
been
extinguished
sometimes
for
severe
practice
he
attempted
to
construct
short
tales
in
the
manner
of
this
or
that
master
he
sighed
over
these
desperate
attempts
over
the
clattering
pieces
of
mechanism
which
would
not
even
simulate
life
but
he
urged
himself
to
an
infinite
perseverance
through
the
white
hours
he
worked
on
amidst
the
heap
and
litter
of
papers
books
and
manuscripts
overflowed
from
the
bureau
to
the
floor
and
if
he
looked
out
he
saw
the
mist
still
pass
by
still
passing
from
the
river
to
the
north
it
was
not
till
the
winter
was
well
advanced
that
he
began
at
all
to
explore
the
region
in
which
he
lived
soon
after
his
arrival
in
the
grey
street
he
had
taken
one
or
two
vague
walks
hardly
noticing
where
he
went
or
what
he
saw
but
for
all
the
summer
he
had
shut
himself
in
his
room
beholding
nothing
but
the
form
and
color
of
words
for
his
morning
walk
he
almost
invariably
chose
the
one
direction
going
along
the
uxbridge
road
towards
notting
hill
and
returning
by
the
same
monotonous
thoroughfare
now
however
when
the
new
year
was
beginning
its
dull
days
he
began
to
diverge
occasionally
to
right
and
left
sometimes
eating
his
luncheon
in
odd
corners
in
the
bulging
parlors
of
taverns
that
still
fronted
the
surging
sea
of
modern
streets
or
perhaps
in
brand
new
publics
on
the
broken
borders
of
the
brickfields
smelling
of
the
clay
from
which
they
had
swollen
he
found
waste
behind
railway
embankments
where
he
could
smoke
his
pipe
sheltered
from
the
wind
sometimes
there
was
a
wooden
fence
by
an
old
where
he
sat
and
gazed
at
the
wet
desolation
of
the
munching
a
few
currant
biscuits
by
way
of
dinner
as
he
went
farther
afield
a
sense
of
immensity
slowly
grew
upon
him
it
was
as
if
from
the
little
island
of
his
room
that
one
friendly
place
he
pushed
out
into
the
grey
unknown
into
a
city
that
for
him
was
uninhabited
as
the
desert
he
came
back
to
his
cell
after
these
purposeless
wanderings
always
with
a
sense
of
relief
with
the
thought
of
taking
refuge
from
grey
as
he
lit
the
gas
and
opened
the
desk
of
his
bureau
and
saw
the
pile
of
papers
awaiting
him
it
was
as
if
he
had
passed
from
the
black
skies
and
the
stinging
wind
and
the
dull
maze
of
the
suburb
into
all
the
warmth
and
sunlight
and
violent
color
of
the
south
vi
it
was
in
this
winter
after
his
coming
to
the
grey
street
that
lucian
first
experienced
the
pains
of
desolation
he
had
all
his
life
known
the
delights
of
solitude
and
had
acquired
that
habit
of
mind
which
makes
a
man
find
rich
company
on
the
bare
hillside
and
leads
him
into
the
heart
of
the
wood
to
meditate
by
the
dark
waterpools
but
now
in
the
blank
interval
when
he
was
forced
to
shut
up
his
desk
the
sense
of
loneliness
overwhelmed
him
and
filled
him
with
unutterable
melancholy
on
such
days
he
carried
about
with
him
an
unceasing
gnawing
torment
in
his
breast
the
anguish
of
the
empty
page
awaiting
him
in
his
bureau
and
the
knowledge
that
it
was
worse
than
useless
to
attempt
the
work
he
had
fallen
into
the
habit
of
always
using
this
phrase
the
work
to
denote
the
adventure
of
literature
it
had
grown
in
his
mind
to
all
the
austere
and
grave
significance
of
the
great
work
on
the
lips
of
the
alchemists
it
included
every
trifling
and
laborious
page
and
the
vague
magnificent
fancies
that
sometimes
hovered
below
him
all
else
had
become
mere
unimportant
trivial
the
work
was
the
end
and
the
means
and
the
food
of
his
life
it
raised
him
up
in
the
morning
to
renew
the
struggle
it
was
the
symbol
which
charmed
him
as
he
lay
down
at
night
all
through
the
hours
of
toil
at
the
bureau
he
was
enchanted
and
when
he
went
out
and
explored
the
unknown
coasts
the
one
thought
allured
him
and
was
the
colored
glass
between
his
eyes
and
the
world
then
as
he
drew
nearer
home
his
steps
would
quicken
and
the
more
weary
and
grey
the
walk
the
more
he
rejoiced
as
he
thought
of
his
hermitage
and
of
the
curious
difficulties
that
awaited
him
there
but
when
suddenly
and
without
warning
the
faculty
disappeared
when
his
mind
seemed
a
hopeless
waste
from
which
nothing
could
arise
then
he
became
subject
to
a
misery
so
piteous
that
the
barbarians
themselves
would
have
been
sorry
for
him
he
had
known
some
foretaste
of
these
bitter
and
inexpressible
griefs
in
the
old
country
days
but
then
he
had
immediately
taken
refuge
in
the
hills
he
had
rushed
to
the
dark
woods
as
to
an
anodyne
letting
his
heart
drink
in
all
the
wonder
and
magic
of
the
wild
land
now
in
these
days
of
january
in
the
suburban
street
there
was
no
such
refuge
he
had
been
working
steadily
for
some
weeks
well
enough
satisfied
on
the
whole
with
the
daily
progress
glad
to
awake
in
the
morning
and
to
read
over
what
he
had
written
on
the
night
before
the
new
year
opened
with
faint
and
heavy
weather
and
a
breathless
silence
in
the
air
but
in
a
few
days
the
great
frost
set
in
soon
the
streets
began
to
suggest
the
appearance
of
a
beleaguered
city
the
silence
that
had
preceded
the
frost
deepened
and
the
mist
hung
over
the
earth
like
a
dense
white
smoke
night
after
night
the
cold
increased
and
people
seemed
unwilling
to
go
abroad
till
even
the
main
thoroughfares
were
empty
and
deserted
as
if
the
inhabitants
were
lying
close
in
hiding
it
was
at
this
dismal
time
that
lucian
found
himself
reduced
to
impotence
there
was
a
sudden
break
in
his
thought
and
when
he
wrote
on
valiantly
hoping
against
hope
he
only
grew
more
aghast
on
the
discovery
of
the
imbecilities
he
had
committed
to
paper
he
ground
his
teeth
together
and
persevered
sick
at
heart
feeling
as
if
all
the
world
were
fallen
from
under
his
feet
driving
his
pen
on
mechanically
till
he
was
overwhelmed
he
saw
the
stuff
he
had
done
without
veil
or
possible
concealment
a
lamentable
and
wretched
sheaf
of
verbiage
worse
it
seemed
than
the
efforts
of
his
boyhood
he
was
not
longer
tautological
he
avoided
tautology
with
the
infernal
art
of
a
filling
his
wind
bags
and
mincing
words
as
if
he
had
been
a
trained
journalist
on
the
staff
of
the
there
seemed
all
the
matter
of
an
insufferable
tragedy
in
these
thoughts
that
his
patient
and
enduring
toil
was
in
vain
that
practice
went
for
nothing
and
that
he
had
wasted
the
labor
of
milton
to
accomplish
the
unhappily
he
could
not
give
in
the
longing
the
fury
for
the
work
burnt
within
him
like
a
burning
fire
he
lifted
up
his
eyes
in
despair
it
was
then
while
he
knew
that
no
one
could
help
him
that
he
languished
for
help
and
then
though
he
was
aware
that
no
comfort
was
possible
he
fervently
wished
to
be
comforted
the
only
friend
he
had
was
his
father
and
he
knew
that
his
father
would
not
even
understand
his
distress
for
him
always
the
printed
book
was
the
beginning
and
end
of
literature
the
agony
of
the
maker
his
despair
and
sickness
were
as
accursed
as
the
pains
of
labor
he
was
ready
to
read
and
admire
the
work
of
the
great
smith
but
he
did
not
wish
to
hear
of
the
period
when
the
great
smith
had
writhed
and
twisted
like
a
scotched
worm
only
hoping
to
be
put
out
of
his
misery
to
go
mad
or
die
to
escape
somehow
from
the
bitter
pains
and
lucian
knew
no
one
else
now
and
then
he
read
in
the
paper
the
fame
of
the
great
the
gypsies
were
entertaining
the
prince
of
wales
the
jolly
beggars
were
dining
with
the
lord
mayor
the
old
mumpers
were
mingling
amicably
and
gorgeously
with
the
leading
members
of
the
stock
exchange
he
was
so
unfortunate
as
to
know
none
of
these
gentlemen
but
it
hardly
seemed
likely
that
they
could
have
done
much
for
him
in
any
case
indeed
in
his
heart
he
was
certain
that
help
and
comfort
from
without
were
in
the
nature
of
things
utterly
impossible
his
ruin
and
grief
were
within
and
only
his
own
assistance
could
avail
he
tried
to
reassure
himself
to
believe
that
his
torments
were
a
proof
of
his
vocation
that
the
facility
of
the
novelist
who
stood
six
years
deep
in
contracts
to
produce
romances
was
a
thing
wholly
undesirable
but
all
the
while
he
longed
for
but
a
drop
of
that
inexhaustible
fluency
which
he
professed
to
despise
he
drove
himself
out
from
that
dreary
contemplation
of
the
white
paper
and
the
idle
pen
he
went
into
the
frozen
and
deserted
streets
hoping
that
he
might
pluck
the
burning
coal
from
his
heart
but
the
fire
was
not
quenched
as
he
walked
furiously
along
the
grim
iron
roads
he
fancied
that
those
persons
who
passed
him
cheerfully
on
their
way
to
friends
and
friendly
hearths
shrank
from
him
into
the
mists
as
they
went
by
lucian
imagined
that
the
fire
of
his
torment
and
anguish
must
in
some
way
glow
visibly
about
him
he
moved
perhaps
in
a
nimbus
that
proclaimed
the
blackness
and
the
flames
within
he
knew
of
course
that
in
misery
he
had
grown
delirious
that
the
personages
who
loomed
out
of
the
fog
upon
him
were
in
reality
shuddering
only
with
cold
but
in
spite
of
common
sense
he
still
conceived
that
he
saw
on
their
faces
an
evident
horror
and
disgust
and
something
of
the
repugnance
that
one
feels
at
the
sight
of
a
venomous
snake
trailing
its
bleeding
vileness
out
of
sight
by
design
lucian
tried
to
make
for
remote
and
desolate
places
and
yet
when
he
had
succeeded
in
touching
on
the
open
country
and
knew
that
the
icy
shadow
hovering
through
the
mist
was
a
field
he
longed
for
some
sound
and
murmur
of
life
and
turned
again
to
roads
where
pale
lamps
were
glimmering
and
the
dancing
flame
of
firelight
shone
across
the
frozen
shrubs
and
the
sight
of
these
homely
fires
the
thought
of
affection
and
consolation
waiting
by
them
stung
him
the
more
sharply
perhaps
because
of
the
contrast
with
his
own
chills
and
weariness
and
helpless
sickness
and
chiefly
because
he
knew
that
he
had
long
closed
an
everlasting
door
between
his
heart
and
such
felicities
if
those
within
had
come
out
and
had
called
him
by
his
name
to
enter
and
be
comforted
it
would
have
been
quite
unavailing
since
between
them
and
him
there
was
a
great
gulf
fixed
perhaps
for
the
first
time
he
realized
that
he
had
lost
the
art
of
humanity
for
ever
he
had
thought
when
he
closed
his
ears
to
the
wood
whisper
and
changed
the
fauns
singing
for
the
murmur
of
the
streets
the
black
pools
for
the
shadows
and
amber
light
of
london
that
he
had
put
off
the
old
life
and
had
turned
his
soul
to
healthy
activities
but
the
truth
was
that
he
had
merely
exchanged
one
drug
for
another
he
could
not
be
human
and
he
wondered
whether
there
were
some
drop
of
the
fairy
blood
in
his
body
that
made
him
foreign
and
a
stranger
in
the
world
he
did
not
surrender
to
desolation
without
repeated
struggles
he
strove
to
allure
himself
to
his
desk
by
the
promise
of
some
easy
task
he
would
not
attempt
invention
but
he
had
memoranda
and
rough
jottings
of
ideas
in
his
and
he
would
merely
amplify
the
suggestions
ready
to
his
hand
but
it
was
hopeless
again
and
again
it
was
hopeless
as
he
read
over
his
notes
trusting
that
he
would
find
some
hint
that
might
light
up
the
dead
fires
and
kindle
again
that
pure
flame
of
enthusiasm
he
found
how
desperately
his
fortune
had
fallen
he
could
see
no
light
no
color
in
the
lines
he
had
scribbled
with
eager
trembling
fingers
he
remembered
how
splendid
all
these
things
had
been
when
he
wrote
them
down
but
now
they
were
meaningless
faded
into
grey
the
few
words
he
had
dashed
on
to
the
paper
enraptured
at
the
thought
of
the
happy
hours
they
promised
had
become
mere
jargon
and
when
he
understood
the
idea
it
seemed
foolish
dull
unoriginal
he
discovered
something
at
last
that
appeared
to
have
a
grain
of
promise
and
determined
to
do
his
best
to
put
it
into
shape
but
the
first
paragraph
appalled
him
it
might
have
been
written
by
an
unintelligent
schoolboy
he
tore
the
paper
in
pieces
and
shut
and
locked
his
desk
heavy
despair
sinking
like
lead
into
his
heart
for
the
rest
of
that
day
he
lay
motionless
on
the
bed
smoking
pipe
after
pipe
in
the
hope
of
stupefying
himself
with
tobacco
fumes
the
air
in
the
room
became
blue
and
thick
with
smoke
it
was
bitterly
cold
and
he
wrapped
himself
up
in
his
and
drew
the
counterpane
over
him
the
night
came
on
and
the
window
darkened
and
at
last
he
fell
asleep
he
renewed
the
effort
at
intervals
only
to
plunge
deeper
into
misery
he
felt
the
approaches
of
madness
and
knew
that
his
only
hope
was
to
walk
till
he
was
physically
exhausted
so
that
he
might
come
home
almost
fainting
with
fatigue
but
ready
to
fall
asleep
the
moment
he
got
into
bed
he
passed
the
mornings
in
a
kind
of
torpor
endeavoring
to
avoid
thought
to
occupy
his
mind
with
the
pattern
of
the
paper
with
the
advertisements
at
the
end
of
a
book
with
the
curious
greyness
of
the
light
that
glimmered
through
the
mist
into
his
room
with
the
muffled
voices
that
rumbled
now
and
then
from
the
street
he
tried
to
make
out
the
design
that
had
once
colored
the
faded
carpet
on
the
floor
and
wondered
about
the
dead
artist
in
japan
the
adorner
of
his
bureau
he
speculated
as
to
what
his
thoughts
had
been
as
he
inserted
the
rainbow
and
made
that
great
flight
of
shining
birds
dipping
their
wings
as
they
rose
from
the
reeds
or
how
he
had
conceived
the
lacquer
dragons
in
red
gold
and
the
fantastic
houses
in
the
garden
of
but
sooner
or
later
the
oppression
of
his
grief
returned
the
loud
shriek
and
clang
of
the
the
warning
bell
of
some
passing
bicyclist
steering
through
the
fog
the
noise
of
his
pipe
falling
to
the
floor
would
suddenly
awaken
him
to
the
sense
of
misery
he
knew
that
it
was
time
to
go
out
he
could
not
bear
to
sit
still
and
suffer
sometimes
she
cut
a
slice
of
bread
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
sometimes
he
trusted
to
the
chance
of
finding
a
where
he
could
have
a
sandwich
and
a
glass
of
beer
he
turned
always
from
the
main
streets
and
lost
himself
in
the
intricate
suburban
byways
willing
to
be
engulfed
in
the
infinite
whiteness
of
the
mist
the
roads
had
stiffened
into
iron
ridges
the
fences
and
trees
were
glittering
with
frost
crystals
everything
was
of
strange
and
altered
aspect
lucian
walked
on
and
on
through
the
maze
now
in
a
circle
of
shadowy
villas
awful
as
the
buried
streets
of
herculaneum
now
in
lanes
dipping
onto
open
country
that
led
him
past
great
whose
white
boughs
were
all
still
and
past
the
bitter
lonely
fields
where
the
mist
seemed
to
fade
away
into
grey
darkness
as
he
wandered
along
these
unfamiliar
and
ghastly
paths
he
became
the
more
convinced
of
his
utter
remoteness
from
all
humanity
he
allowed
that
grotesque
suggestion
of
there
being
something
visibly
amiss
in
his
outward
appearance
to
grow
upon
him
and
often
he
looked
with
a
horrible
expectation
into
the
faces
of
those
who
passed
by
afraid
lest
his
own
senses
gave
him
false
intelligence
and
that
he
had
really
assumed
some
frightful
and
revolting
shape
it
was
curious
that
partly
by
his
own
fault
and
largely
no
doubt
through
the
operation
of
mere
coincidence
he
was
once
or
twice
strongly
confirmed
in
this
fantastic
delusion
he
came
one
day
into
a
lonely
and
unfrequented
byway
a
country
lane
falling
into
ruin
but
still
fringed
with
elms
that
had
formed
an
avenue
leading
to
the
old
it
was
now
the
road
of
communication
between
two
far
outlying
suburbs
and
on
these
winter
nights
lay
as
black
dreary
and
desolate
as
a
mountain
track
soon
after
the
frost
began
a
gentleman
had
been
set
upon
in
this
lane
as
he
picked
his
way
between
the
corner
where
the
bus
had
set
him
down
and
his
home
where
the
fire
was
blazing
and
his
wife
watched
the
clock
he
was
stumbling
uncertainly
through
the
gloom
growing
a
little
nervous
because
the
walk
seemed
so
long
and
peering
anxiously
for
the
lamp
at
the
end
of
his
street
when
the
two
footpads
rushed
at
him
out
of
the
fog
one
caught
him
from
behind
the
other
struck
him
with
a
heavy
bludgeon
and
as
he
lay
senseless
they
robbed
him
of
his
watch
and
money
and
vanished
across
the
fields
the
next
morning
all
the
suburb
rang
with
the
story
the
unfortunate
merchant
had
been
grievously
hurt
and
wives
watched
their
husbands
go
out
in
the
morning
with
sickening
apprehension
not
knowing
what
might
happen
at
night
lucian
of
course
was
ignorant
of
all
these
rumors
and
struck
into
the
gloomy
without
caring
where
he
was
or
whither
the
way
would
lead
him
he
had
been
driven
out
that
day
as
with
whips
another
hopeless
attempt
to
return
to
the
work
had
agonised
him
and
existence
seemed
an
intolerable
pain
as
he
entered
the
deeper
gloom
where
the
fog
hung
heavily
he
began
half
consciously
to
gesticulate
he
felt
convulsed
with
torment
and
shame
and
it
was
a
sorry
relief
to
clench
his
nails
into
his
palm
and
strike
the
air
as
he
stumbled
heavily
along
bruising
his
feet
against
the
frozen
ruts
and
ridges
his
impotence
was
hideous
he
said
to
himself
and
he
cursed
himself
and
his
life
breaking
out
into
a
loud
oath
and
stamping
on
the
ground
suddenly
he
was
shocked
at
a
scream
of
terror
it
seemed
in
his
very
ear
and
looking
up
he
saw
for
a
moment
a
woman
gazing
at
him
out
of
the
mist
her
features
distorted
and
stiff
with
fear
a
momentary
convulsion
twitched
her
arms
into
the
ugly
mimicry
of
a
beckoning
gesture
and
she
turned
and
ran
for
dear
life
howling
like
a
beast
lucian
stood
still
in
the
road
while
the
woman
cries
grew
faint
and
died
away
his
heart
was
chilled
within
him
as
the
significance
of
this
strange
incident
became
clear
he
remembered
nothing
of
his
violent
gestures
he
had
not
known
at
the
time
that
he
had
sworn
out
loud
or
that
he
was
grinding
his
teeth
with
impotent
rage
he
only
thought
of
that
ringing
scream
of
the
horrible
fear
on
the
white
face
that
had
looked
upon
him
of
the
woman
headlong
flight
from
his
presence
he
stood
trembling
and
shuddering
and
in
a
little
while
he
was
feeling
his
face
searching
for
some
loathsome
mark
for
the
stigmata
of
evil
branding
his
forehead
he
staggered
homewards
like
a
drunken
man
and
when
he
came
into
the
uxbridge
road
some
children
saw
him
and
called
after
him
as
he
swayed
and
caught
at
the
when
he
got
to
his
room
he
sat
down
at
first
in
the
dark
he
did
not
dare
to
light
the
gas
everything
in
the
room
was
indistinct
but
he
shut
his
eyes
as
he
passed
the
and
sat
in
a
corner
his
face
turned
to
the
wall
and
when
at
last
he
gathered
courage
and
the
flame
leapt
hissing
from
the
jet
he
crept
piteously
towards
the
glass
and
ducked
his
head
crouching
miserably
and
struggling
with
his
terrors
before
he
could
look
at
his
own
image
to
the
best
of
his
power
he
tried
to
deliver
himself
from
these
more
grotesque
fantasies
he
assured
himself
that
there
was
nothing
terrific
in
his
countenance
but
sadness
that
his
face
was
like
the
face
of
other
men
yet
he
could
not
forget
that
reflection
he
had
seen
in
the
eyes
how
the
surest
mirrors
had
shown
him
a
horrible
dread
her
soul
itself
quailing
and
shuddering
at
an
awful
sight
her
scream
rang
and
rang
in
his
ears
she
had
fled
away
from
him
as
if
he
offered
some
fate
darker
than
death
he
looked
again
and
again
into
the
glass
tortured
by
a
hideous
uncertainty
his
senses
told
him
there
was
nothing
amiss
yet
he
had
had
a
proof
and
yet
as
he
peered
most
earnestly
there
was
it
seemed
something
strange
and
not
altogether
usual
in
the
expression
of
the
eyes
perhaps
it
might
be
the
unsteady
flare
of
the
gas
or
perhaps
a
flaw
in
the
cheap
that
gave
some
slight
distortion
to
the
image
he
walked
briskly
up
and
down
the
room
and
tried
to
gaze
steadily
indifferently
into
his
own
face
he
would
not
allow
himself
to
be
misguided
by
a
word
when
he
had
pronounced
himself
incapable
of
humanity
he
had
only
meant
that
he
could
not
enjoy
the
simple
things
of
common
life
a
man
was
not
necessarily
monstrous
merely
because
he
did
not
appreciate
high
tea
a
quiet
chat
about
the
neighbors
and
a
happy
noisy
evening
with
the
children
but
with
what
message
then
did
he
appear
charged
that
the
woman
mouth
grew
so
stark
her
hands
had
jerked
up
as
if
they
had
been
pulled
with
frantic
wires
she
seemed
for
the
instant
like
a
horrible
puppet
her
scream
was
a
thing
from
the
nocturnal
sabbath
he
lit
a
candle
and
held
it
close
up
to
the
glass
so
that
his
own
face
glared
white
at
him
and
the
reflection
of
the
room
became
an
indistinct
darkness
he
saw
nothing
but
the
candle
flame
and
his
own
shining
eyes
and
surely
they
were
not
as
the
eyes
of
common
men
as
he
put
down
the
light
a
sudden
suggestion
entered
his
mind
and
he
drew
a
quick
breath
amazed
at
the
thought
he
hardly
knew
whether
to
rejoice
or
to
shudder
for
the
thought
he
conceived
was
this
that
he
had
mistaken
all
the
circumstances
of
the
adventure
and
had
perhaps
repulsed
a
sister
who
would
have
welcomed
him
to
the
sabbath
he
lay
awake
all
night
turning
from
one
dreary
and
frightful
thought
to
the
other
scarcely
dozing
for
a
few
hours
when
the
dawn
came
he
tried
for
a
moment
to
argue
with
himself
when
he
got
up
knowing
that
his
true
life
was
locked
up
in
the
bureau
he
made
a
desperate
attempt
to
drive
the
phantoms
and
hideous
shapes
from
his
mind
he
was
assured
that
his
salvation
was
in
the
work
and
he
drew
the
key
from
his
pocket
and
made
as
if
he
would
have
opened
the
desk
but
the
nausea
the
remembrances
of
repeated
and
utter
failure
were
too
powerful
for
many
days
he
hung
about
the
manor
lane
half
dreading
half
desiring
another
meeting
and
he
swore
he
would
not
again
mistake
the
cry
of
rapture
nor
repulse
the
arms
extended
in
a
frenzy
of
delight
in
those
days
he
dreamed
of
some
dark
place
where
they
might
celebrate
and
make
the
marriage
of
the
sabbath
with
such
rites
as
he
had
dared
to
imagine
it
was
perhaps
only
the
shock
of
a
letter
from
his
father
that
rescued
him
from
these
evident
approaches
to
madness
taylor
wrote
how
they
had
missed
him
at
christmas
how
the
farmers
had
inquired
after
him
of
the
homely
familiar
things
that
recalled
his
boyhood
his
mother
voice
the
friendly
fireside
and
the
good
old
fashions
that
had
nurtured
him
he
remembered
that
he
had
once
been
a
boy
loving
the
cake
and
puddings
and
the
radiant
holly
and
all
the
mirth
that
lingered
on
in
the
ancient
farmhouses
and
there
came
to
him
the
more
holy
memory
of
mass
on
christmas
morning
how
sweet
the
dark
and
frosty
earth
had
smelt
as
he
walked
beside
his
mother
down
the
winding
lane
and
from
the
stile
near
the
church
they
had
seen
the
world
glimmering
to
the
dawn
and
the
wandering
lanthorns
advancing
across
the
fields
then
he
had
come
into
the
church
and
seen
it
shining
with
candles
and
holly
and
his
father
in
pure
vestments
of
white
linen
sang
the
longing
music
of
the
liturgy
at
the
altar
and
the
people
answered
him
till
the
sun
rose
with
the
grave
notes
of
the
paternoster
and
a
red
beam
stole
through
the
chancel
window
the
worst
horror
left
him
as
he
recalled
the
memory
of
these
dear
and
holy
things
he
cast
away
the
frightful
fancy
that
the
scream
he
had
heard
was
a
shriek
of
joy
that
the
arms
rigidly
jerked
out
invited
him
to
an
embrace
indeed
the
thought
that
he
had
longed
for
such
an
obscene
illusion
that
he
had
gloated
over
the
recollection
of
that
stark
mouth
filled
him
with
disgust
he
resolved
that
his
senses
were
deceived
that
he
had
neither
seen
nor
heard
but
had
for
a
moment
externalized
his
own
slumbering
and
morbid
dreams
it
was
perhaps
necessary
that
he
should
be
wretched
that
his
efforts
should
be
discouraged
but
he
would
not
yield
utterly
to
madness
yet
when
he
went
abroad
with
such
good
resolutions
it
was
hard
to
resist
an
influence
that
seemed
to
come
from
without
and
within
he
did
not
know
it
but
people
were
everywhere
talking
of
the
great
frost
of
the
fog
that
lay
heavy
on
london
making
the
streets
dark
and
terrible
of
strange
birds
that
came
fluttering
about
the
windows
in
the
silent
squares
the
thames
rolled
out
duskily
bearing
down
the
jarring
and
as
one
looked
on
the
black
water
from
the
bridges
it
was
like
a
river
in
a
northern
tale
to
lucian
it
all
seemed
mythical
of
the
same
substance
as
his
own
fantastic
thoughts
he
rarely
saw
a
newspaper
and
did
not
follow
from
day
to
day
the
systematic
readings
of
the
thermometer
the
reports
of
of
coaches
driven
across
the
river
at
hampton
of
the
skating
on
the
fens
and
hence
the
iron
roads
the
beleaguered
silence
and
the
heavy
folds
of
mist
appeared
as
amazing
as
a
picture
significant
appalling
he
could
not
look
out
and
see
a
common
suburban
street
foggy
and
dull
nor
think
of
the
inhabitants
as
at
work
or
sitting
cheerfully
eating
nuts
about
their
fires
he
saw
a
vision
of
a
grey
road
vanishing
of
dim
houses
all
empty
and
deserted
and
the
silence
seemed
eternal
and
when
he
went
out
and
passed
through
street
after
street
all
void
by
the
vague
shapes
of
houses
that
appeared
for
a
moment
and
were
then
instantly
swallowed
up
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
had
strayed
into
a
city
that
had
suffered
some
inconceivable
doom
that
he
alone
wandered
where
myriads
had
once
dwelt
it
was
a
town
as
great
as
babylon
terrible
as
rome
marvelous
as
lost
atlantis
set
in
the
midst
of
a
white
wilderness
surrounded
by
waste
places
it
was
impossible
to
escape
from
it
if
he
skulked
between
hedges
and
crept
away
beyond
the
frozen
pools
presently
the
serried
stony
lines
confronted
him
like
an
army
and
far
and
far
they
swept
away
into
the
night
as
some
fabled
wall
that
guards
an
empire
in
the
vast
dim
east
or
in
that
distorting
medium
of
the
mist
changing
all
things
he
imagined
that
he
trod
an
infinite
desolate
plain
abandoned
from
ages
but
circled
and
encircled
with
dolmen
and
menhir
that
loomed
out
at
him
gigantic
terrible
all
london
was
one
grey
temple
of
an
awful
rite
ring
within
ring
of
wizard
stones
circled
about
some
central
place
every
circle
was
an
initiation
every
initiation
eternal
loss
or
perhaps
he
was
astray
for
ever
in
a
land
of
grey
rocks
he
had
seen
the
light
of
home
the
flicker
of
the
fire
on
the
walls
close
at
hand
it
seemed
was
the
open
door
and
he
had
heard
dear
voices
calling
to
him
across
the
gloom
but
he
had
just
missed
the
path
the
lamps
vanished
the
voices
sounded
thin
and
died
away
and
yet
he
knew
that
those
within
were
waiting
that
they
could
not
bear
to
close
the
door
but
waited
calling
his
name
while
he
had
missed
the
way
and
wandered
in
the
pathless
desert
of
the
grey
rocks
fantastic
hideous
they
beset
him
wherever
he
turned
piled
up
into
strange
shapes
pricked
with
sharp
peaks
assuming
the
appearance
of
goblin
towers
swelling
into
a
vague
dome
like
a
fairy
rath
huge
and
terrible
and
as
one
dream
faded
into
another
so
these
last
fancies
were
perhaps
the
most
tormenting
and
persistent
the
rocky
avenues
became
the
camp
and
fortalice
of
some
malignant
race
who
swarmed
in
hiding
ready
to
bear
him
away
into
the
heart
of
their
horrible
hills
it
was
awful
to
think
that
all
his
goings
were
surrounded
that
in
the
darkness
he
was
watched
and
surveyed
that
every
step
but
led
him
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
labyrinth
when
of
an
evening
he
was
secure
in
his
room
the
blind
drawn
down
and
the
gas
flaring
he
made
vigorous
efforts
toward
sanity
it
was
not
of
his
free
will
that
he
allowed
terror
to
overmaster
him
and
he
desired
nothing
better
than
a
placid
and
harmless
life
full
of
work
and
clear
thinking
he
knew
that
he
deluded
himself
with
imagination
that
he
had
been
walking
through
london
suburbs
and
not
through
pandemonium
and
that
if
he
could
but
unlock
his
bureau
all
those
ugly
forms
would
be
resolved
into
the
mist
but
it
was
hard
to
say
if
he
consoled
himself
effectually
with
such
reflections
for
the
return
to
common
sense
meant
also
the
return
to
the
sharp
pangs
of
defeat
it
recalled
him
to
the
bitter
theme
of
his
own
inefficiency
to
the
thought
that
he
only
desired
one
thing
of
life
and
that
this
was
denied
him
he
was
willing
to
endure
the
austerities
of
a
monk
in
a
severe
cloister
to
suffer
cold
to
be
hungry
to
be
lonely
and
friendless
to
forbear
all
the
consolation
of
friendly
speech
and
to
be
glad
of
all
these
things
if
only
he
might
be
allowed
to
illuminate
the
manuscript
in
quietness
it
seemed
a
hideous
insufferable
cruelty
that
he
should
so
fervently
desire
that
which
he
could
never
gain
he
was
led
back
to
the
old
conclusion
he
had
lost
the
sense
of
humanity
he
was
wretched
because
he
was
an
alien
and
a
stranger
amongst
citizens
it
seemed
probable
that
the
enthusiasm
of
literature
as
he
understood
it
the
fervent
desire
for
the
fine
art
had
in
it
something
of
the
inhuman
and
dissevered
the
enthusiast
from
his
it
was
possible
that
the
barbarian
suspected
as
much
that
by
some
slow
process
of
rumination
he
had
arrived
at
his
fixed
and
inveterate
impression
by
no
means
a
clear
reasoned
conviction
the
average
philistine
if
pressed
for
the
reasons
of
his
dislike
would
either
become
inarticulate
ejaculating
faugh
and
pah
like
an
scots
magazine
or
else
he
would
give
some
imaginary
and
absurd
reason
alleging
that
all
littery
men
were
poor
that
composers
never
cut
their
hair
that
painters
were
rarely
men
that
sculptors
could
ride
straight
to
hounds
to
save
their
lives
but
clearly
these
imbecilities
were
mere
afterthoughts
the
average
man
hated
the
artist
from
a
deep
instinctive
dread
of
all
that
was
strange
uncanny
alien
to
his
nature
he
gibbered
uttered
his
harsh
faugh
and
dismissed
keats
to
his
gallipots
from
much
the
same
motives
as
usually
impelled
the
black
savages
to
dismiss
the
white
man
on
an
even
longer
journey
lucian
was
not
especially
interested
in
this
hatred
of
the
barbarian
for
the
maker
except
from
this
point
that
it
confirmed
him
in
his
belief
that
the
love
of
art
dissociated
the
man
from
the
race
one
touch
of
art
made
the
whole
world
alien
but
surely
miseries
of
the
civilized
man
cast
amongst
savages
were
not
so
much
caused
by
dread
of
their
ferocity
as
by
the
terror
of
his
own
thoughts
he
would
perhaps
in
his
last
despair
leave
his
retreat
and
go
forth
to
perish
at
their
hands
so
that
he
might
at
least
die
in
company
and
hear
the
sound
of
speech
before
death
and
lucian
felt
most
keenly
that
in
his
case
there
was
a
double
curse
he
was
as
isolated
as
keats
and
as
inarticulate
as
his
reviewers
the
consolation
of
the
work
had
failed
him
and
he
was
suspended
in
the
void
between
two
worlds
it
was
no
doubt
the
composite
effect
of
his
failures
his
loneliness
of
soul
and
solitude
of
life
that
had
made
him
invest
those
common
streets
with
such
grim
and
persistent
terrors
he
had
perhaps
yielded
to
a
temptation
without
knowing
that
he
had
been
tempted
and
in
the
manner
of
de
quincey
had
chosen
the
subtle
in
exchange
for
the
more
tangible
pains
unconsciously
but
still
of
free
will
he
had
preferred
the
splendor
and
the
gloom
of
a
malignant
vision
before
his
corporal
pains
before
the
hard
reality
of
his
own
impotence
it
was
better
to
dwell
in
vague
melancholy
to
stray
in
the
forsaken
streets
of
a
city
doomed
from
ages
to
wander
amidst
forlorn
and
desperate
rocks
than
to
awake
to
a
gnawing
and
ignoble
torment
to
confess
that
a
house
of
business
would
have
been
more
suitable
and
more
practical
that
he
had
promised
what
he
could
never
perform
even
as
he
struggled
to
beat
back
the
phantasmagoria
of
the
mist
and
resolved
that
he
would
no
longer
make
all
the
streets
a
stage
of
apparitions
he
hardly
realized
what
he
had
done
or
that
the
ghosts
he
had
called
might
depart
and
return
again
he
continued
his
long
walks
always
with
the
object
of
producing
a
physical
weariness
and
exhaustion
that
would
enable
him
to
sleep
of
nights
but
even
when
he
saw
the
foggy
and
deserted
avenues
in
their
proper
shape
and
allowed
his
eyes
to
catch
the
pale
glimmer
of
the
lamps
and
the
dancing
flame
of
the
firelight
he
could
not
rid
himself
of
the
impression
that
he
stood
afar
off
that
between
those
hearths
and
himself
there
was
a
great
gulf
fixed
as
he
paced
down
the
footpath
he
could
often
see
plainly
across
the
frozen
shrubs
into
the
homely
and
cheerful
rooms
sometimes
late
in
the
evening
he
caught
a
passing
glimpse
of
the
family
at
tea
father
mother
and
children
laughing
and
talking
together
well
pleased
with
each
other
company
sometimes
a
wife
or
a
child
was
standing
by
the
garden
gate
peering
anxiously
through
the
fog
and
the
sight
of
it
all
all
the
little
details
the
hideous
but
comfortable
armchairs
turned
ready
to
the
fire
curtains
being
drawn
close
to
shut
out
the
ugly
night
the
sudden
blaze
and
illumination
as
the
fire
was
poked
up
so
that
it
might
be
cheerful
for
father
these
trivial
and
common
things
were
acutely
significant
they
brought
back
to
him
the
image
of
a
dead
boy
himself
they
recalled
the
shabby
old
parlor
in
the
country
with
its
shabby
old
furniture
and
fading
carpet
and
renewed
a
whole
atmosphere
of
affection
and
homely
comfort
his
mother
would
walk
to
the
end
of
the
drive
and
look
out
for
him
when
he
was
late
wandering
then
about
the
dark
woodlands
on
winter
evenings
she
would
make
the
fire
blaze
and
have
his
slippers
warming
by
the
hearth
and
there
was
probably
buttered
toast
as
a
treat
he
dwelt
on
all
these
insignificant
petty
circumstances
on
the
genial
glow
and
light
after
the
muddy
winter
lanes
on
the
relish
of
the
buttered
toast
and
the
smell
of
the
hot
tea
on
the
two
old
cats
curled
fast
asleep
before
the
fender
and
made
them
instruments
of
exquisite
pain
and
regret
each
of
these
strange
houses
that
he
passed
was
identified
in
his
mind
with
his
own
vanished
home
all
was
prepared
and
ready
as
in
the
old
days
but
he
was
shut
out
judged
and
condemned
to
wander
in
the
frozen
mist
with
weary
feet
anguished
and
forlorn
and
they
that
would
pass
from
within
to
help
him
could
not
neither
could
he
pass
to
them
again
for
the
hundredth
time
he
came
back
to
the
sentence
he
could
not
gain
the
art
of
letters
and
he
had
lost
the
art
of
humanity
he
saw
the
vanity
of
all
his
thoughts
he
was
an
ascetic
caring
nothing
for
warmth
and
cheerfulness
and
the
small
comforts
of
life
and
yet
he
allowed
his
mind
to
dwell
on
such
things
if
one
of
those
who
walked
briskly
eager
for
home
should
have
pitied
him
by
some
miracle
and
asked
him
to
come
in
it
would
have
been
worse
than
useless
yet
he
longed
for
pleasures
that
he
could
not
have
enjoyed
it
was
as
if
he
were
come
to
a
place
of
torment
where
they
who
could
not
drink
longed
for
water
where
they
who
could
feel
no
warmth
shuddered
in
the
eternal
cold
he
was
oppressed
by
the
grim
conceit
that
he
himself
still
slept
within
the
matted
thicket
imprisoned
by
the
green
bastions
of
the
roman
fort
he
had
never
come
out
but
a
changeling
had
gone
down
the
hill
and
now
stirred
about
the
earth
beset
by
such
ingenious
terrors
it
was
not
wonderful
that
outward
events
and
common
incidents
should
abet
his
fancies
he
had
succeeded
one
day
in
escaping
from
the
mesh
of
the
streets
and
fell
on
a
rough
and
narrow
lane
that
stole
into
a
little
valley
for
the
moment
he
was
in
a
somewhat
happier
mood
the
afternoon
sun
glowed
through
the
rolling
mist
and
the
air
grew
clearer
he
saw
quiet
and
peaceful
fields
and
a
wood
descending
in
a
gentle
slope
from
an
old
farmstead
of
warm
red
brick
the
farmer
was
driving
the
slow
cattle
home
from
the
hill
and
his
loud
halloo
to
his
dog
came
across
the
land
a
cheerful
mellow
note
from
another
side
a
cart
was
approaching
the
clustered
barns
hesitating
pausing
while
the
great
horses
rested
and
then
starting
again
into
lazy
motion
in
the
well
of
the
valley
a
wandering
line
of
bushes
showed
where
a
brook
crept
in
and
out
amongst
the
meadows
and
as
lucian
stood
lingering
on
the
bridge
a
soft
and
idle
breath
ruffled
through
the
boughs
of
a
great
elm
he
felt
soothed
as
by
calm
music
and
wondered
whether
it
would
not
be
better
for
him
to
live
in
some
such
quiet
place
within
reach
of
the
streets
and
yet
remote
from
them
it
seemed
a
refuge
for
still
thoughts
he
could
imagine
himself
sitting
at
rest
beneath
the
black
yew
tree
in
the
farm
garden
at
the
close
of
a
summer
day
he
had
almost
determined
that
he
would
knock
at
the
door
and
ask
if
they
would
take
him
as
a
lodger
when
he
saw
a
child
running
towards
him
down
the
lane
it
was
a
little
girl
with
bright
curls
tossing
about
her
head
and
as
she
came
on
the
sunlight
glowed
upon
her
illuminating
her
frock
and
the
yellow
in
her
hat
she
had
run
with
her
eyes
on
the
ground
chirping
and
laughing
to
herself
and
did
not
see
lucian
till
she
was
quite
near
him
she
started
and
glanced
into
his
eyes
for
a
moment
and
began
to
cry
he
stretched
out
his
hand
and
she
ran
from
him
screaming
frightened
no
doubt
by
what
was
to
her
a
sudden
and
strange
apparition
he
turned
back
towards
london
and
the
mist
folded
him
in
its
thick
darkness
for
on
that
evening
it
was
tinged
with
black
it
was
only
by
the
intensest
strain
of
resolution
that
he
did
not
yield
utterly
to
the
poisonous
anodyne
which
was
always
at
hand
it
had
been
a
difficult
struggle
to
escape
from
the
mesh
of
the
hills
from
the
music
of
the
fauns
and
even
now
he
was
drawn
by
the
memory
of
these
old
allurements
but
he
felt
that
here
in
his
loneliness
he
was
in
greater
danger
and
beset
by
a
blacker
magic
horrible
fancies
rushed
wantonly
into
his
mind
he
was
not
only
ready
to
believe
that
something
in
his
soul
sent
a
shudder
through
all
that
was
simple
and
innocent
but
he
came
trembling
home
one
saturday
night
believing
or
that
he
was
in
communion
with
evil
he
had
passed
through
the
clamorous
and
blatant
crowd
of
the
high
street
where
as
one
climbed
the
hill
the
shops
seemed
all
aflame
and
the
black
night
air
glowed
with
the
flaring
and
the
hissing
and
wavering
before
the
february
wind
voices
raucous
clamant
abominable
were
belched
out
of
the
blazing
as
the
doors
swung
to
and
fro
and
above
these
doors
were
hideous
brassy
lamps
very
slowly
swinging
in
a
violent
blast
of
air
so
that
they
might
have
been
infernal
thuribles
censing
the
people
some
man
was
calling
his
wares
in
one
long
continuous
shriek
that
never
stopped
or
paused
and
as
a
respond
a
deeper
louder
voice
roared
to
him
from
across
the
road
an
italian
whirled
the
handle
of
his
in
a
fury
and
a
ring
of
imps
danced
mad
figures
around
him
danced
and
flung
up
their
legs
till
the
rags
dropped
from
some
of
them
and
they
still
danced
on
a
flare
of
naphtha
burning
with
a
rushing
noise
threw
a
light
on
one
point
of
the
circle
and
lucian
watched
a
lank
girl
of
fifteen
as
she
came
round
and
round
to
the
flash
she
was
quite
drunk
and
had
kicked
her
petticoats
away
and
the
crowd
howled
laughter
and
applause
at
her
her
black
hair
poured
down
and
leapt
on
her
scarlet
bodice
she
sprang
and
leapt
round
the
ring
laughing
in
bacchic
frenzy
and
led
the
orgy
to
triumph
people
were
crossing
to
and
fro
jostling
against
each
other
swarming
about
certain
shops
and
stalls
in
a
dense
dark
mass
that
quivered
and
sent
out
feelers
as
if
it
were
one
writhing
organism
a
little
farther
a
group
of
young
men
arm
in
arm
were
marching
down
the
roadway
chanting
some
verse
in
full
chorus
so
that
it
sounded
like
plainsong
an
impossible
hubbub
a
hum
of
voices
angry
as
swarming
bees
the
squeals
of
five
or
six
girls
who
ran
in
and
out
and
dived
up
dark
passages
and
darted
back
into
the
crowd
all
these
mingled
together
till
his
ears
quivered
a
young
fellow
was
playing
the
concertina
and
he
touched
the
keys
with
such
slow
fingers
that
the
tune
wailed
solemn
into
a
dirge
but
there
was
nothing
so
strange
as
the
burst
of
sound
that
swelled
out
when
the
doors
were
opened
he
walked
amongst
these
people
looked
at
their
faces
and
looked
at
the
children
amongst
them
he
had
come
out
thinking
that
he
would
see
the
english
working
class
the
and
the
crowd
in
the
world
enjoying
the
simple
pleasure
of
the
saturday
shopping
mother
bought
the
joint
for
sunday
dinner
and
perhaps
a
pair
of
boots
for
father
father
had
an
honest
glass
of
beer
and
the
children
were
given
bags
of
sweets
and
then
all
these
worthy
people
went
decently
home
to
their
rest
de
quincey
had
enjoyed
the
sight
in
his
day
and
had
studied
the
rise
and
fall
of
onions
and
potatoes
lucian
indeed
had
desired
to
take
these
simple
emotions
as
an
opiate
to
forget
the
fine
fret
and
fantastic
trouble
of
his
own
existence
in
plain
things
and
the
palpable
joy
of
rest
after
labor
he
was
only
afraid
lest
he
should
be
too
sharply
reproached
by
the
sight
of
these
men
who
fought
bravely
year
after
year
against
starvation
who
knew
nothing
of
intricate
and
imagined
grief
but
only
the
weariness
of
relentless
labor
of
the
long
battle
for
their
wives
and
children
it
would
be
pathetic
he
thought
to
see
them
content
with
so
little
brightened
by
the
expectation
of
a
day
rest
and
a
good
dinner
forced
even
then
to
reckon
every
penny
and
to
make
their
children
laugh
with
halfpence
either
he
would
be
ashamed
before
so
much
content
or
else
he
would
be
again
touched
by
the
sense
of
his
inhumanity
which
could
take
no
interest
in
the
common
things
of
life
but
still
he
went
to
be
at
least
taken
out
of
himself
to
be
forced
to
look
at
another
side
of
the
world
so
that
he
might
perhaps
forget
a
little
while
his
own
sorrows
he
was
fascinated
by
what
he
saw
and
heard
he
wondered
whether
de
quincey
also
had
seen
the
same
spectacle
and
had
concealed
his
impressions
out
of
reverence
for
the
average
reader
here
there
were
no
simple
joys
of
honest
toilers
but
wonderful
orgies
that
drew
out
his
heart
to
horrible
music
at
first
the
violence
of
sound
and
sight
had
overwhelmed
him
the
lights
flaring
in
the
night
wind
the
array
of
naphtha
lamps
the
black
shadows
the
roar
of
voices
the
dance
about
the
had
been
the
first
sign
of
an
inner
meaning
and
the
face
of
the
dark
girl
as
she
came
round
and
round
to
the
flame
had
been
amazing
in
its
utter
furious
abandon
and
what
songs
they
were
singing
all
around
him
and
what
terrible
words
rang
out
only
to
excite
peals
of
laughter
in
the
the
workmen
wives
the
wives
of
small
tradesmen
decently
dressed
in
black
were
drinking
their
faces
to
a
flaming
red
and
urging
their
husbands
to
drink
more
beautiful
young
women
flushed
and
laughing
put
their
arms
round
the
men
necks
and
kissed
them
and
then
held
up
the
glass
to
their
lips
in
the
dark
corners
at
the
openings
of
side
streets
the
children
were
talking
together
instructing
each
other
whispering
what
they
had
seen
a
boy
of
fifteen
was
plying
a
girl
of
twelve
with
whisky
and
presently
they
crept
away
lucian
passed
them
as
they
turned
to
go
and
both
looked
at
him
the
boy
laughed
and
the
girl
smiled
quietly
it
was
above
all
in
the
faces
around
him
that
he
saw
the
most
astounding
things
the
bacchic
fury
unveiled
and
unashamed
to
his
eyes
it
seemed
as
if
these
revelers
recognized
him
as
a
fellow
and
smiled
up
in
his
face
aware
that
he
was
in
the
secret
every
instinct
of
religion
of
civilization
even
was
swept
away
they
gazed
at
one
another
and
at
him
absolved
of
all
scruples
children
of
the
earth
and
nothing
more
now
and
then
a
couple
detached
themselves
from
the
swarm
and
went
away
into
the
darkness
answering
the
jeers
and
laughter
of
their
friends
as
they
vanished
on
the
edge
of
the
pavement
not
far
from
where
he
was
standing
lucian
noticed
a
tall
and
lovely
young
woman
who
seemed
to
be
alone
she
was
in
the
full
light
of
a
naphtha
flame
and
her
bronze
hair
and
flushed
cheeks
shone
illuminate
as
she
viewed
the
orgy
she
had
dark
brown
eyes
and
a
strange
look
as
of
an
old
picture
in
her
face
and
her
eyes
brightened
with
an
urgent
gleam
he
saw
the
revelers
nudging
each
other
and
glancing
at
her
and
two
or
three
young
men
went
up
and
asked
her
to
come
for
a
walk
she
shook
her
head
and
said
no
thank
you
again
and
again
and
seemed
as
if
she
were
looking
for
somebody
in
the
crowd
i
expecting
a
friend
she
said
at
last
to
a
man
who
proposed
a
drink
and
a
walk
afterwards
and
lucian
wondered
what
kind
of
friend
would
ultimately
appear
suddenly
she
turned
to
him
as
he
was
about
to
pass
on
and
said
in
a
low
voice
i
go
for
a
walk
with
you
if
you
like
you
just
go
on
and
i
follow
in
a
minute
for
a
moment
he
looked
steadily
at
her
he
saw
that
the
first
glance
has
misled
him
her
face
was
not
flushed
with
drink
as
he
had
supposed
but
it
was
radiant
with
the
most
exquisite
color
a
red
flame
glowed
and
died
on
her
cheek
and
seemed
to
palpitate
as
she
spoke
the
head
was
set
on
the
neck
nobly
as
in
a
statue
and
about
the
ears
the
bronze
hair
strayed
into
little
curls
she
was
smiling
and
waiting
for
his
answer
he
muttered
something
about
being
very
sorry
and
fled
down
the
hill
out
of
the
orgy
from
the
noise
of
roaring
voices
and
the
glitter
of
the
great
lamps
very
slowly
swinging
in
the
blast
of
wind
he
knew
that
he
had
touched
the
brink
of
utter
desolation
there
was
death
in
the
face
and
she
had
indeed
summoned
him
to
the
sabbath
somehow
he
had
been
able
to
refuse
on
the
instant
but
if
he
had
delayed
he
knew
he
would
have
abandoned
himself
to
her
body
and
soul
he
locked
himself
in
his
room
and
lay
trembling
on
the
bed
wondering
if
some
subtle
sympathy
had
shown
the
woman
her
perfect
companion
he
looked
in
the
glass
not
expecting
now
to
see
certain
visible
and
outward
signs
but
searching
for
the
meaning
of
that
strange
glance
that
lit
up
his
eyes
he
had
grown
even
thinner
than
before
in
the
last
few
months
and
his
cheeks
were
wasted
with
hunger
and
sorrow
but
there
were
still
about
his
features
the
suggestion
of
a
curious
classic
grace
and
the
look
as
of
a
faun
who
has
strayed
from
the
vineyards
and
olive
gardens
he
had
broken
away
but
now
he
felt
the
mesh
of
her
net
about
him
a
desire
for
her
that
was
a
madness
as
if
she
held
every
nerve
in
his
body
and
drew
him
to
her
to
her
mystic
world
to
the
rosebush
where
every
flower
was
a
flame
he
dreamed
all
night
of
the
perilous
things
he
had
refused
and
it
was
loss
to
awake
in
the
morning
pain
to
return
to
the
world
the
frost
had
broken
and
the
fog
had
rolled
away
and
the
grey
street
was
filled
with
a
clear
grey
light
again
he
looked
out
on
the
long
dull
sweep
of
the
monotonous
houses
hidden
for
the
past
weeks
by
a
curtain
of
mist
heavy
rain
had
fallen
in
the
night
and
the
garden
rails
were
still
dripping
the
roofs
still
dark
with
wet
all
down
the
line
the
dingy
white
blinds
were
drawn
in
the
upper
windows
not
a
soul
walked
the
street
every
one
was
asleep
after
the
exertions
of
the
night
before
even
on
the
main
road
it
was
only
at
intervals
that
some
straggler
paddled
by
presently
a
woman
in
a
brown
ulster
shuffled
off
on
some
errand
then
a
man
in
poked
out
his
head
holding
the
door
and
stared
up
at
a
window
opposite
after
a
few
minutes
he
slunk
in
again
and
three
loafers
came
slouching
down
the
street
eager
for
mischief
or
beastliness
of
some
sort
they
chose
a
house
that
seemed
rather
smarter
than
the
rest
and
irritated
by
the
neat
curtains
the
little
grass
plot
with
its
dwarf
shrub
one
of
the
ruffians
drew
out
a
piece
of
chalk
and
wrote
some
words
on
the
front
door
his
friends
kept
watch
for
him
and
the
adventure
achieved
all
three
bolted
bellowing
yahoo
laughter
then
a
bell
began
tang
tang
tang
and
here
and
there
children
appeared
on
their
way
to
and
the
chapel
teachers
went
by
with
verjuice
eyes
and
lips
scowling
at
the
little
boy
who
cried
piper
piper
on
the
main
road
many
respectable
people
the
men
shining
and
the
women
hideously
bedizened
passed
in
the
direction
of
the
independent
nightmare
the
stuccoed
thing
with
doric
columns
but
on
the
whole
life
was
stagnant
presently
lucian
smelt
the
horrid
fumes
of
roast
beef
and
cabbage
the
early
risers
were
preparing
the
meal
but
many
lay
in
bed
and
put
off
dinner
till
three
with
the
effect
of
prolonging
the
cabbage
atmosphere
into
the
late
afternoon
a
drizzly
rain
began
as
the
people
were
coming
out
of
church
and
the
mothers
of
little
boys
in
velvet
and
little
girls
in
foolishness
of
every
kind
were
impelled
to
slap
their
offspring
and
to
threaten
them
with
father
then
the
torpor
of
beef
and
beer
and
cabbage
settled
down
on
the
street
in
some
houses
they
snorted
and
read
the
parish
magazine
in
some
they
snored
and
read
the
murders
and
collected
filth
of
the
week
but
the
only
movement
of
the
afternoon
was
a
second
procession
of
children
now
bloated
and
distended
with
food
again
answering
the
summons
of
tang
tang
tang
on
the
main
road
the
trams
laden
with
impossible
people
went
humming
to
and
fro
and
young
men
who
wore
bright
blue
ties
cheerfully
and
smoked
penny
cigars
they
annoyed
the
shiny
and
respectable
and
not
by
the
frightful
stench
of
the
cigars
but
because
they
were
cheerful
on
sunday
by
and
by
the
children
having
heard
about
moses
in
the
bulrushes
and
daniel
in
the
lion
den
came
straggling
home
in
an
evil
humor
and
all
the
day
it
was
as
if
on
a
grey
sheet
grey
shadows
flickered
passing
by
and
in
the
every
flower
was
a
flame
he
thought
in
symbols
using
the
persian
imagery
of
a
dusky
court
surrounded
by
white
cloisters
gilded
by
gates
of
bronze
the
stars
came
out
the
sky
glowed
a
darker
violet
but
the
cloistered
wall
the
fantastic
trellises
in
stone
shone
whiter
it
was
like
a
hedge
of
like
a
lily
within
a
cup
of
like
tossed
on
the
heaving
sea
at
dawn
always
those
white
cloisters
trembled
with
the
lute
music
always
the
garden
sang
with
the
clear
fountain
rising
and
falling
in
the
mysterious
dusk
and
there
was
a
singing
voice
stealing
through
the
white
lattices
and
the
bronze
gates
a
soft
voice
chanting
of
the
lover
and
the
beloved
of
the
vineyard
of
the
gate
and
the
way
oh
the
language
was
unknown
but
the
music
of
the
refrain
returned
again
and
again
swelling
and
trembling
through
the
white
nets
of
the
latticed
cloisters
and
every
rose
in
the
dusky
air
was
a
flame
he
had
seen
the
life
which
he
expressed
by
these
symbols
offered
to
him
and
he
had
refused
it
and
he
was
alone
in
the
grey
street
with
its
lamps
just
twinkling
through
the
dreary
twilight
the
blast
of
a
ribald
chorus
sounding
from
the
main
road
a
doggerel
hymn
whining
from
some
parlor
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
harmonium
he
wondered
why
he
had
turned
away
from
that
woman
who
knew
all
secrets
in
whose
eyes
were
all
the
mysteries
he
opened
the
desk
of
his
bureau
and
was
confronted
by
the
heap
and
litter
of
papers
lying
in
confusion
as
he
had
left
them
he
knew
that
there
was
the
motive
of
his
refusal
he
had
been
unwilling
to
abandon
all
hope
of
the
work
the
glory
and
the
torment
of
his
ambition
glowed
upon
him
as
he
looked
at
the
manuscript
it
seemed
so
pitiful
that
such
a
single
desire
should
be
thwarted
he
was
aware
that
if
he
chose
to
sit
down
now
before
the
desk
he
could
in
a
manner
write
easily
enough
he
could
produce
a
tale
which
would
be
formally
well
constructed
and
certain
of
favorable
reception
and
it
would
not
be
the
utterly
commonplace
entirely
hopeless
favorite
of
the
circulating
library
it
would
stand
in
those
ranks
where
the
real
thing
is
skillfully
counterfeited
amongst
the
books
which
give
the
reader
his
orgy
of
emotions
and
yet
contrive
to
be
superior
and
art
in
his
opinion
lucian
had
often
observed
this
species
of
triumph
and
had
noted
the
acclamation
that
never
failed
the
clever
sham
for
example
had
made
the
great
host
of
the
serious
the
portentous
shout
for
joy
while
the
real
book
cloister
and
the
was
a
comparative
failure
he
knew
that
he
could
write
a
but
he
thought
the
art
of
counterfeiting
less
detestable
than
this
shabby
trick
of
imitating
literature
he
had
refused
definitely
to
enter
the
atelier
of
the
gentleman
who
pleased
his
clients
by
ingeniously
simulating
the
grain
of
walnut
and
though
he
had
seen
the
old
oaken
ambry
kicked
out
contemptuously
into
the
farmyard
serving
perhaps
the
necessities
of
hens
or
pigs
he
would
not
apprentice
himself
to
the
masters
of
veneer
he
paced
up
and
down
the
room
glancing
now
and
again
at
his
papers
and
wondering
if
there
were
not
hope
for
him
a
great
thing
he
could
never
do
but
he
had
longed
to
do
a
true
thing
to
imagine
sincere
and
genuine
pages
he
was
stirred
again
to
this
fury
for
the
work
by
the
event
of
the
evening
before
by
all
that
had
passed
through
his
mind
since
the
melancholy
dawn
the
lurid
picture
of
that
fiery
street
the
flaming
shops
and
flaming
glances
all
its
wonders
and
horrors
lit
by
the
naphtha
flares
and
by
the
burning
souls
had
possessed
him
and
the
noises
the
shriek
and
the
whisper
the
jangling
rattle
of
the
the
scream
of
the
butcher
as
he
dabbled
in
the
blood
the
lewd
litany
of
the
singers
these
seemed
to
be
resolved
into
an
infernal
overture
loud
with
the
expectation
of
lust
and
death
and
how
the
spectacle
was
set
in
the
cloud
of
dark
night
a
phantom
play
acted
on
that
fiery
stage
beneath
those
hideous
brassy
lamps
very
slowly
swinging
in
a
violent
blast
as
all
the
medley
of
outrageous
sights
and
sounds
now
fused
themselves
within
his
brain
into
one
clear
impression
it
seemed
that
he
had
indeed
witnessed
and
acted
in
a
drama
that
all
the
scene
had
been
prepared
and
vested
for
him
and
that
the
choric
songs
he
had
heard
were
but
preludes
to
a
greater
act
for
in
that
woman
was
the
consummation
and
catastrophe
of
it
all
and
the
whole
stage
waited
for
their
meeting
he
fancied
that
after
this
the
voices
and
the
lights
died
away
that
the
crowd
sank
swiftly
into
the
darkness
and
that
the
street
was
at
once
denuded
of
the
great
lamps
and
of
all
its
awful
scenic
apparatus
again
he
thought
the
same
mystery
would
be
represented
before
him
suddenly
on
some
dark
and
gloomy
night
as
he
wandered
lonely
on
a
deserted
road
the
wind
hurrying
before
him
suddenly
a
turn
would
bring
him
again
upon
the
fiery
stage
and
the
antique
drama
would
be
he
would
be
drawn
to
the
same
place
to
find
that
woman
still
standing
there
again
he
would
watch
the
rose
radiant
and
palpitating
upon
her
cheek
the
argent
gleam
in
her
brown
eyes
the
bronze
curls
gilding
the
white
splendor
of
her
neck
and
for
the
second
time
she
would
freely
offer
herself
he
could
hear
the
wail
of
the
singers
swelling
to
a
shriek
and
see
the
dusky
dancers
whirling
round
in
a
faster
frenzy
and
the
naphtha
flares
tinged
with
red
as
the
woman
and
he
went
away
into
the
dark
into
the
cloistered
court
where
every
flower
was
a
flame
whence
he
would
never
come
out
his
only
escape
was
in
the
desk
he
might
find
salvation
if
he
could
again
hide
his
heart
in
the
heap
and
litter
of
papers
and
again
be
rapt
by
the
cadence
of
a
phrase
he
threw
open
his
window
and
looked
out
on
the
dim
world
and
the
glimmering
amber
lights
he
resolved
that
he
would
rise
early
in
the
morning
and
seek
once
more
for
his
true
life
in
the
work
but
there
was
a
strange
thing
there
was
a
little
bottle
on
the
mantelpiece
a
bottle
of
dark
blue
glass
and
he
trembled
and
shuddered
before
it
as
if
it
were
a
fetish
vii
it
was
very
dark
in
the
room
he
seemed
by
slow
degrees
to
awake
from
a
long
and
heavy
torpor
from
an
utter
forgetfulness
and
as
he
raised
his
eyes
he
could
scarcely
discern
the
pale
whiteness
of
the
paper
on
the
desk
before
him
he
remembered
something
of
a
gloomy
winter
afternoon
of
driving
rain
of
gusty
wind
he
had
fallen
asleep
over
his
work
no
doubt
and
the
night
had
come
down
he
lay
back
in
his
chair
wondering
whether
it
were
late
his
eyes
were
half
closed
and
he
did
not
make
the
effort
and
rouse
himself
he
could
hear
the
stormy
noise
of
the
wind
and
the
sound
reminded
him
of
the
days
he
thought
of
his
boyhood
and
the
old
rectory
and
the
great
elms
that
surrounded
it
there
was
something
pleasant
in
the
consciousness
that
he
was
still
half
dreaming
he
knew
he
could
wake
up
whenever
he
pleased
but
for
the
moment
he
amused
himself
by
the
pretence
that
he
was
a
little
boy
again
tired
with
his
rambles
and
the
keen
air
of
the
hills
he
remembered
how
he
would
sometimes
wake
up
in
the
dark
at
midnight
and
listen
sleepily
for
a
moment
to
the
rush
of
the
wind
straining
and
crying
amongst
the
trees
and
hear
it
beat
upon
the
walls
and
then
he
would
fall
to
dreams
again
happy
in
his
warm
snug
bed
the
wind
grew
louder
and
the
windows
rattled
he
half
opened
his
eyes
and
shut
them
again
determined
to
cherish
that
sensation
of
long
ago
he
felt
tired
and
heavy
with
sleep
he
imagined
that
he
was
exhausted
by
some
effort
he
had
perhaps
been
writing
furiously
without
rest
he
could
not
recollect
at
the
instant
what
the
work
had
been
it
would
be
delightful
to
read
the
pages
when
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
bestir
himself
surely
that
was
the
noise
of
boughs
swaying
and
grinding
in
the
wind
he
remembered
one
night
at
home
when
such
a
sound
had
roused
him
suddenly
from
a
deep
sweet
sleep
there
was
a
rushing
and
beating
as
of
wings
upon
the
air
and
a
heavy
dreary
noise
like
thunder
far
away
upon
the
mountain
he
had
got
out
of
bed
and
looked
from
behind
the
blind
to
see
what
was
abroad
he
remembered
the
strange
sight
he
had
seen
and
he
pretended
it
would
be
just
the
same
if
he
cared
to
look
out
now
there
were
clouds
flying
awfully
from
before
the
moon
and
a
pale
light
that
made
the
familiar
land
look
strange
and
terrible
the
blast
of
wind
came
with
a
great
shriek
and
the
trees
tossed
and
bowed
and
quivered
the
wood
was
scourged
and
horrible
and
the
night
air
was
ghastly
with
a
confused
tumult
and
voices
as
of
a
host
a
huge
black
cloud
rolled
across
the
heaven
from
the
west
and
covered
up
the
moon
and
there
came
a
torrent
of
bitter
hissing
rain
it
was
all
a
vivid
picture
to
him
as
he
sat
in
his
chair
unwilling
to
wake
even
as
he
let
his
mind
stray
back
to
that
night
of
the
past
years
the
rain
beat
sharply
on
the
and
though
there
were
no
trees
in
the
grey
suburban
street
he
heard
distinctly
the
crash
of
boughs
he
wandered
vaguely
from
thought
to
thought
groping
indistinctly
amongst
memories
like
a
man
trying
to
cross
from
door
to
door
in
a
darkened
unfamiliar
room
but
no
doubt
if
he
were
to
look
out
by
some
magic
the
whole
scene
would
be
displayed
before
him
he
would
not
see
the
curve
of
monotonous
houses
with
here
and
there
a
white
blind
a
patch
of
light
and
shadows
appearing
and
vanishing
not
the
rain
plashing
in
the
muddy
road
not
the
amber
of
the
opposite
but
the
wild
moonlight
poured
on
the
dearly
loved
country
far
away
the
dim
circle
of
the
hills
and
woods
and
beneath
him
the
tossing
trees
about
the
lawn
and
the
wood
heaving
under
the
fury
of
the
wind
he
smiled
to
himself
amidst
his
lazy
meditations
to
think
how
real
it
seemed
and
yet
it
was
all
far
away
the
scenery
of
an
old
play
long
ended
and
forgotten
it
was
strange
that
after
all
these
years
of
trouble
and
work
and
change
he
should
be
in
any
sense
the
same
person
as
that
little
boy
peeping
out
half
frightened
from
the
rectory
window
it
was
as
if
looking
in
the
glass
one
should
see
a
stranger
and
yet
know
that
the
image
was
a
true
reflection
the
memory
of
the
old
home
recalled
his
father
and
mother
to
him
and
he
wondered
whether
his
mother
would
come
if
he
were
to
cry
out
suddenly
one
night
on
just
such
a
night
as
this
when
a
great
storm
blew
from
the
mountain
a
tree
had
fallen
with
a
crash
and
a
bough
had
struck
the
roof
and
he
awoke
in
a
fright
calling
for
his
mother
she
had
come
and
had
comforted
him
soothing
him
to
sleep
and
now
he
shut
his
eyes
seeing
her
face
shining
in
the
uncertain
flickering
candle
light
as
she
bent
over
his
bed
he
could
not
think
she
had
died
the
memory
was
but
a
part
of
the
evil
dreams
that
had
come
afterwards
he
said
to
himself
that
he
had
fallen
asleep
and
dreamed
sorrow
and
agony
and
he
wished
to
forget
all
the
things
of
trouble
he
would
return
to
happy
days
to
the
beloved
land
to
the
dear
and
friendly
paths
across
the
fields
there
was
the
paper
white
before
him
and
when
he
chose
to
stir
he
would
have
the
pleasure
of
reading
his
work
he
could
not
quite
recollect
what
he
had
been
about
but
he
was
somehow
conscious
that
the
had
been
successful
and
had
brought
some
long
labor
to
a
worthy
ending
presently
he
would
light
the
gas
and
enjoy
the
satisfaction
that
only
the
work
could
give
him
but
for
the
time
he
preferred
to
linger
in
the
darkness
and
to
think
of
himself
as
straying
from
stile
to
stile
through
the
scented
meadows
and
listening
to
the
bright
brook
that
sang
to
the
alders
it
was
winter
now
for
he
heard
the
rain
and
the
wind
and
the
swaying
of
the
trees
but
in
those
old
days
how
sweet
the
summer
had
been
the
great
hawthorn
bush
in
blossom
like
a
white
cloud
upon
the
earth
had
appeared
to
him
in
twilight
he
had
lingered
in
the
enclosed
valley
to
hear
the
nightingale
a
voice
swelling
out
from
the
rich
gloom
from
the
trees
that
grew
around
the
well
the
scent
of
the
meadowsweet
was
blown
to
him
across
the
bridge
of
years
and
with
it
came
the
dream
and
the
hope
and
the
longing
and
the
afterglow
red
in
the
sky
and
the
marvel
of
the
earth
there
was
a
quiet
walk
that
he
knew
so
well
one
went
up
from
a
little
green
byroad
following
an
unnamed
brooklet
scarce
a
foot
wide
but
yet
wandering
like
a
river
gurgling
over
its
pebbles
with
its
dwarf
bushes
shading
the
pouring
water
one
went
through
the
meadow
grass
and
came
to
the
larch
wood
that
grew
from
hill
to
hill
across
the
stream
and
shone
a
brilliant
tender
green
and
sent
vague
sweet
spires
to
the
flushing
sky
through
the
wood
the
path
wound
turning
and
dipping
and
beneath
the
brown
fallen
needles
of
last
year
were
soft
and
thick
and
the
resinous
cones
gave
out
their
odor
as
the
warm
night
advanced
and
the
shadows
darkened
it
was
quite
still
but
he
stayed
and
the
faint
song
of
the
brooklet
sounded
like
the
echo
of
a
river
beyond
the
mountains
how
strange
it
was
to
look
into
the
wood
to
see
the
tall
straight
stems
rising
and
then
the
dusk
uncertain
and
then
the
blackness
so
he
came
out
from
the
larch
wood
from
the
green
cloud
and
the
vague
shadow
into
the
dearest
of
all
hollows
shut
in
on
one
side
by
the
larches
and
before
him
by
high
violent
walls
of
turf
like
the
slopes
of
a
fort
with
a
clear
line
dark
against
the
twilight
sky
and
a
weird
thorn
bush
that
grew
large
mysterious
on
the
summit
beneath
the
gleam
of
the
evening
star
and
he
retraced
his
wanderings
in
those
deep
old
lanes
that
began
from
the
common
road
and
went
away
towards
the
unknown
climbing
steep
hills
and
piercing
the
woods
of
shadows
and
dipping
down
into
valleys
that
seemed
virgin
unexplored
secret
for
the
foot
of
man
he
entered
such
a
lane
not
knowing
where
it
might
bring
him
hoping
he
had
found
the
way
to
fairyland
to
the
woods
beyond
the
world
to
that
vague
territory
that
haunts
all
the
dreams
of
a
boy
he
could
not
tell
where
he
might
be
for
the
high
banks
rose
steep
and
the
great
hedges
made
a
green
vault
above
marvelous
ferns
grew
rich
and
thick
in
the
dark
red
earth
fastening
their
roots
about
the
roots
of
hazel
and
beech
and
maple
clustering
like
the
carven
capitals
of
a
cathedral
pillar
down
like
a
dark
shaft
the
lane
dipped
to
the
well
of
the
hills
and
came
amongst
the
limestone
rocks
he
climbed
the
bank
at
last
and
looked
out
into
a
country
that
seemed
for
a
moment
the
land
he
sought
a
mysterious
realm
with
unfamiliar
hills
and
valleys
and
fair
plains
all
golden
and
white
houses
radiant
in
the
sunset
light
and
he
thought
of
the
steep
hillsides
where
the
bracken
was
like
a
wood
and
of
bare
places
where
the
west
wind
sang
over
the
golden
gorse
of
still
circles
in
of
the
poisonous
in
the
middle
of
the
wood
shedding
its
crimson
cups
on
the
dank
earth
how
he
lingered
by
certain
black
waterpools
hedged
on
every
side
by
drooping
and
alders
watching
the
faint
waves
widening
to
the
banks
as
a
leaf
or
a
twig
dropped
from
the
trees
and
the
whole
air
and
wonder
of
the
ancient
forest
came
back
to
him
he
had
found
his
way
to
the
river
valley
to
the
long
lovely
hollow
between
the
hills
and
went
up
and
up
beneath
the
leaves
in
the
warm
hush
of
midsummer
glancing
back
now
and
again
through
the
green
alleys
to
the
river
winding
in
mystic
esses
beneath
passing
hidden
glens
receiving
the
streams
that
rushed
down
the
hillside
from
the
rock
passing
the
immemorial
tumulus
the
graves
where
the
legionaries
waited
for
the
trumpet
the
grey
farmhouses
sending
the
blue
wreaths
of
wood
smoke
into
the
still
air
he
went
higher
and
higher
till
at
last
he
entered
the
long
passage
of
the
roman
road
and
from
this
the
ridge
and
summit
of
the
wood
he
saw
the
waves
of
green
swell
and
dip
and
sink
towards
the
marshy
level
and
the
gleaming
yellow
sea
he
looked
on
the
surging
forest
and
thought
of
the
strange
deserted
city
moldering
into
a
petty
village
on
its
verge
of
its
encircling
walls
melting
into
the
turf
of
vestiges
of
an
older
temple
which
the
earth
had
buried
utterly
it
was
winter
now
for
he
heard
the
wail
of
the
wind
and
a
sudden
gust
drove
the
rain
against
the
panes
but
he
thought
of
the
bee
song
in
the
clover
of
the
foxgloves
in
full
blossom
of
the
wild
roses
delicate
enchanting
swaying
on
a
long
stem
above
the
hedge
he
had
been
in
strange
places
he
had
known
sorrow
and
desolation
and
had
grown
grey
and
weary
in
the
work
of
letters
but
he
lived
again
in
the
sweetness
in
the
clear
bright
air
of
early
morning
when
the
sky
was
blue
in
june
and
the
mist
rolled
like
a
white
sea
in
the
valley
he
laughed
when
he
recollected
that
he
had
sometimes
fancied
himself
unhappy
in
those
days
in
those
days
when
he
could
be
glad
because
the
sun
shone
because
the
wind
blew
fresh
on
the
mountain
on
those
bright
days
he
had
been
glad
looking
at
the
fleeting
and
passing
of
the
clouds
upon
the
hills
and
had
gone
up
higher
to
the
broad
dome
of
the
mountain
feeling
that
joy
went
up
before
him
he
remembered
how
a
boy
he
had
dreamed
of
love
of
an
adorable
and
ineffable
mystery
which
transcended
all
longing
and
desire
the
time
had
come
when
all
the
wonder
of
the
earth
seemed
to
prefigure
this
alone
when
he
found
the
symbol
of
the
beloved
in
hill
and
wood
and
stream
and
every
flower
and
every
dark
pool
discoursed
a
pure
ecstasy
it
was
the
longing
for
longing
the
love
of
love
that
had
come
to
him
when
he
awoke
one
morning
just
before
the
dawn
and
for
the
first
time
felt
the
sharp
thrill
of
passion
he
tried
in
vain
to
express
to
himself
the
exquisite
joys
of
innocent
desire
even
now
after
troubled
years
in
spite
of
some
dark
cloud
that
overshadowed
the
background
of
his
thought
the
sweetness
of
the
imagined
pleasure
came
like
a
perfume
into
his
reverie
it
was
no
love
of
a
woman
but
the
desire
of
womanhood
the
eros
of
the
unknown
that
made
the
heart
tremble
he
hardly
dreamed
that
such
a
love
could
ever
be
satisfied
that
the
thirst
of
beauty
could
be
slaked
he
shrank
from
all
contact
of
actuality
not
venturing
so
much
as
to
imagine
the
inner
place
and
sanctuary
of
the
mysteries
it
was
enough
for
him
to
adore
in
the
outer
court
to
know
that
within
in
the
sweet
gloom
were
the
vision
and
the
rapture
the
altar
and
the
sacrifice
he
remembered
dimly
the
passage
of
many
heavy
years
since
that
time
of
hope
and
passion
but
perhaps
the
vague
shadow
would
pass
away
and
he
could
renew
the
boy
thoughts
the
unformed
fancies
that
were
part
of
the
bright
day
of
the
wild
roses
in
the
hedgerow
all
other
things
should
be
laid
aside
he
would
let
them
trouble
him
no
more
after
this
winter
night
he
saw
now
that
from
the
first
he
had
allowed
his
imagination
to
bewilder
him
to
create
a
fantastic
world
in
which
he
suffered
molding
innocent
forms
into
terror
and
dismay
vividly
he
saw
again
the
black
circle
of
oaks
growing
in
a
haggard
ring
upon
the
bastions
of
the
roman
fort
the
noise
of
the
storm
without
grew
louder
and
he
thought
how
the
wind
had
come
up
the
valley
with
the
sound
of
a
scream
how
a
great
tree
had
ground
its
boughs
together
shuddering
before
the
violent
blast
clear
and
distinct
as
if
he
were
standing
now
in
the
lane
he
saw
the
steep
slopes
surging
from
the
valley
and
the
black
crown
of
the
oaks
set
against
the
flaming
sky
against
a
blaze
and
glow
of
light
as
if
great
furnace
doors
were
opened
he
saw
the
fire
as
it
were
smitten
about
the
bastions
about
the
heaped
mounds
that
guarded
the
fort
and
the
crooked
evil
boughs
seemed
to
writhe
in
the
blast
of
flame
that
beat
from
heaven
strangely
with
the
sight
of
the
burning
fort
mingled
the
impression
of
a
dim
white
shape
floating
up
the
dusk
of
the
lane
towards
him
and
he
saw
across
the
valley
of
years
a
face
a
momentary
apparition
that
shone
and
vanished
away
then
there
was
a
memory
of
another
day
of
violent
summer
of
white
farmhouse
walls
blazing
in
the
sun
and
a
far
call
from
the
reapers
in
the
cornfields
he
had
climbed
the
steep
slope
and
penetrated
the
matted
thicket
and
lay
in
the
heat
alone
on
the
soft
short
grass
that
grew
within
the
fort
there
was
a
cloud
of
madness
and
confusion
of
broken
dreams
that
had
no
meaning
or
clue
but
only
an
indefinable
horror
and
defilement
he
had
fallen
asleep
as
he
gazed
at
the
knotted
fantastic
boughs
of
the
stunted
brake
about
him
and
when
he
woke
he
was
ashamed
and
fled
away
fearing
that
they
would
pursue
him
he
did
not
know
who
they
were
but
it
seemed
as
if
a
woman
face
watched
him
from
between
the
matted
boughs
and
that
she
summoned
to
her
side
awful
companions
who
had
never
grown
old
through
all
the
ages
he
looked
up
it
seemed
at
a
smiling
face
that
bent
over
him
as
he
sat
in
the
cool
dark
kitchen
of
the
old
farmhouse
and
wondered
why
the
sweetness
of
those
red
lips
and
the
kindness
of
the
eyes
mingled
with
the
nightmare
in
the
fort
with
the
horrible
sabbath
he
had
imagined
as
he
lay
sleeping
on
the
hot
soft
turf
he
had
allowed
these
disturbed
fancies
all
this
mad
wreck
of
terror
and
shame
that
he
had
gathered
in
his
mind
to
trouble
him
for
too
long
a
time
presently
he
would
light
up
the
room
and
leave
all
the
old
darkness
of
his
life
behind
him
and
from
henceforth
he
would
walk
in
the
day
he
could
still
distinguish
though
very
vaguely
the
pile
of
papers
beside
him
and
he
remembered
now
that
he
had
finished
a
long
task
that
afternoon
before
he
fell
asleep
he
could
not
trouble
himself
to
recollect
the
exact
nature
of
the
work
but
he
was
sure
that
he
had
done
well
in
a
few
minutes
perhaps
he
would
strike
a
match
and
read
the
title
and
amuse
himself
with
his
own
forgetfulness
but
the
sight
of
the
papers
lying
there
in
order
made
him
think
of
his
beginnings
of
those
first
unhappy
efforts
which
were
so
impossible
and
so
hopeless
he
saw
himself
bending
over
the
table
in
the
old
familiar
room
desperately
scribbling
and
then
laying
down
his
pen
dismayed
at
the
sad
results
on
the
page
it
was
late
at
night
his
father
had
been
long
in
bed
and
the
house
was
still
the
fire
was
almost
out
with
only
a
dim
glow
here
and
there
amongst
the
cinders
and
the
room
was
growing
chilly
he
rose
at
last
from
his
work
and
looked
out
on
a
dim
earth
and
a
dark
and
cloudy
sky
night
after
night
he
had
labored
on
persevering
in
his
effort
even
through
the
cold
sickness
of
despair
when
every
line
was
doomed
as
it
was
made
now
with
the
consciousness
that
he
knew
at
least
the
conditions
of
literature
and
that
many
years
of
thought
and
practice
had
given
him
some
sense
of
language
he
found
these
early
struggles
both
pathetic
and
astonishing
he
could
not
understand
how
he
had
persevered
so
stubbornly
how
he
had
had
the
heart
to
begin
a
fresh
page
when
so
many
folios
of
blotted
painful
effort
lay
torn
derided
impossible
in
their
utter
failure
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
must
have
been
a
miracle
or
an
infernal
possession
a
species
of
madness
that
had
driven
him
on
every
day
disappointed
and
every
day
hopeful
and
yet
there
was
a
joyous
side
to
the
illusion
in
these
dry
days
that
he
lived
in
when
he
had
bought
by
a
long
experience
and
by
countless
hours
of
misery
a
knowledge
of
his
limitations
of
the
vast
gulf
that
yawned
between
the
conception
and
the
work
it
was
pleasant
to
think
of
a
time
when
all
things
were
possible
when
the
most
splendid
design
seemed
an
affair
of
a
few
weeks
now
he
had
come
to
a
frank
acknowledgment
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
he
judged
every
book
wholly
impossible
till
the
last
line
of
it
was
written
and
he
had
learnt
patience
the
art
of
sighing
and
putting
the
fine
scheme
away
in
the
of
what
could
never
be
but
to
think
of
those
days
then
one
could
plot
out
a
book
that
should
be
more
curious
than
rabelais
and
jot
down
the
outlines
of
a
romance
to
surpass
cervantes
and
design
renaissance
tragedies
and
volumes
of
and
comedies
of
the
restoration
everything
was
to
be
done
and
the
masterpiece
was
always
the
rainbow
cup
a
little
way
before
him
he
touched
the
manuscript
on
the
desk
and
the
feeling
of
the
pages
seemed
to
restore
all
the
papers
that
had
been
torn
so
long
ago
it
was
the
atmosphere
of
the
silent
room
that
returned
the
light
of
the
shaded
candle
falling
on
the
abandoned
leaves
this
had
been
painfully
excogitated
while
the
snowstorm
whirled
about
the
lawn
and
filled
the
lanes
this
was
of
the
summer
night
this
of
the
harvest
moon
rising
like
a
fire
from
the
tithebarn
on
the
hill
how
well
he
remembered
those
pages
of
which
he
had
once
been
so
proud
he
had
thought
out
the
sentences
one
evening
while
he
leaned
on
the
and
watched
the
brook
swim
across
the
road
every
word
smelt
of
the
meadowsweet
that
grew
thick
upon
the
banks
now
as
he
recalled
the
cadence
and
the
phrase
that
had
seemed
so
charming
he
saw
again
the
ferns
beneath
the
vaulted
roots
of
the
beech
and
the
green
light
of
the
glowworm
in
the
hedge
and
in
the
west
the
mountains
swelled
to
a
great
dome
and
on
the
dome
was
a
mound
the
memorial
of
some
forgotten
race
that
grew
dark
and
large
against
the
red
sky
when
the
sun
set
he
had
lingered
below
it
in
the
solitude
amongst
the
winds
at
evening
far
away
from
home
and
oh
the
labor
and
the
vain
efforts
to
make
the
form
of
it
and
the
awe
of
it
in
prose
to
write
the
hush
of
the
vast
hill
and
the
sadness
of
the
world
below
sinking
into
the
night
and
the
mystery
the
suggestion
of
the
rounded
hillock
huge
against
the
magic
sky
he
had
tried
to
sing
in
words
the
music
that
the
brook
sang
and
the
sound
of
the
october
wind
rustling
through
the
brown
bracken
on
the
hill
how
many
pages
he
had
covered
in
the
effort
to
show
a
white
winter
world
a
sun
without
warmth
in
a
sky
all
the
fields
all
the
land
white
and
shining
and
one
high
summit
where
the
dark
pines
towered
still
in
the
still
afternoon
in
the
pale
violet
air
to
win
the
secret
of
words
to
make
a
phrase
that
would
murmur
of
summer
and
the
bee
to
summon
the
wind
into
a
sentence
to
conjure
the
odor
of
the
night
into
the
surge
and
fall
and
harmony
of
a
line
this
was
the
tale
of
the
long
evenings
of
the
candle
flame
white
upon
the
paper
and
the
eager
pen
he
remembered
that
in
some
fantastic
book
he
had
seen
a
bar
or
two
of
music
and
beneath
the
inscription
that
here
was
the
musical
expression
of
westminster
abbey
his
boyish
effort
seemed
hardly
less
ambitious
and
he
no
longer
believed
that
language
could
present
the
melody
and
the
awe
and
the
loveliness
of
the
earth
he
had
long
known
that
he
at
all
events
would
have
to
be
content
with
a
far
approach
with
a
few
broken
notes
that
might
suggest
perhaps
the
magistral
everlasting
song
of
the
hill
and
the
streams
but
in
those
far
days
the
impossible
was
but
a
part
of
wonderland
that
lay
before
him
of
the
world
beyond
the
wood
and
the
mountain
all
was
to
be
conquered
all
was
to
be
achieved
he
had
but
to
make
the
journey
and
he
would
find
the
golden
world
and
the
golden
word
and
hear
those
songs
that
the
sirens
sang
he
touched
the
manuscript
whatever
it
was
it
was
the
result
of
painful
labor
and
disappointment
not
of
the
old
flush
of
hope
but
it
came
of
weary
days
of
correction
and
it
might
be
good
in
its
measure
but
afterwards
he
would
write
no
more
for
a
time
he
would
go
back
again
to
the
happy
world
of
masterpieces
to
the
dreams
of
great
and
perfect
books
written
in
an
ecstasy
like
a
dark
cloud
from
the
sea
came
the
memory
of
the
attempt
he
had
made
of
the
poor
piteous
history
that
had
once
embittered
his
life
he
sighed
and
said
alas
thinking
of
his
folly
of
the
hours
when
he
was
shaken
with
futile
miserable
rage
some
silly
person
in
london
had
made
his
manuscript
more
saleable
and
had
sold
it
without
rendering
an
account
of
the
profits
and
for
that
he
had
been
ready
to
curse
humanity
black
horrible
as
the
memory
of
a
stormy
day
the
rage
of
his
heart
returned
to
his
mind
and
he
covered
his
eyes
endeavoring
to
darken
the
picture
of
terror
and
hate
that
shone
before
him
he
tried
to
drive
it
all
out
of
his
thought
it
vexed
him
to
remember
these
foolish
trifles
the
trick
of
a
publisher
the
small
pomposities
and
malignancies
of
the
country
folk
the
cruelty
of
a
village
boy
had
inflamed
him
almost
to
the
pitch
of
madness
his
heart
had
burnt
with
fury
and
when
he
looked
up
the
sky
was
blotched
and
scarlet
as
if
it
rained
blood
indeed
he
had
almost
believed
that
blood
had
rained
upon
him
and
cold
blood
from
a
sacrifice
in
heaven
his
face
was
wet
and
chill
and
dripping
and
he
had
passed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
and
looked
at
it
a
red
cloud
had
seemed
to
swell
over
the
hill
and
grow
great
and
come
near
to
him
he
was
but
an
ace
removed
from
raging
madness
it
had
almost
come
to
that
the
drift
and
the
breath
of
the
scarlet
cloud
had
touched
him
it
was
strange
that
he
had
been
so
deeply
troubled
by
such
little
things
and
strange
how
after
all
the
years
he
could
still
recall
the
anguish
and
rage
and
hate
that
shook
his
soul
as
with
a
spiritual
tempest
the
memory
of
all
that
evening
was
wild
and
troubled
he
resolved
that
it
should
vex
him
no
more
that
now
for
the
last
time
he
would
let
himself
be
tormented
by
the
past
in
a
few
minutes
he
would
rise
to
a
new
life
and
forget
all
the
storms
that
had
gone
over
him
curiously
every
detail
was
distinct
and
clear
in
his
brain
the
figure
of
the
doctor
driving
home
and
the
sound
of
the
few
words
he
had
spoken
came
to
him
in
the
darkness
through
the
noise
of
the
storm
and
the
pattering
of
the
rain
then
he
stood
upon
the
ridge
of
the
hill
and
saw
the
smoke
drifting
up
from
the
ragged
roofs
of
caermaen
in
the
evening
calm
he
listened
to
the
voices
mounting
thin
and
clear
in
a
weird
tone
as
if
some
outland
folk
were
speaking
in
an
unknown
tongue
of
awful
things
he
saw
the
gathering
darkness
the
mystery
of
twilight
changing
the
huddled
squalid
village
into
an
unearthly
city
into
some
dreadful
atlantis
inhabited
by
a
ruined
race
the
mist
falling
fast
the
gloom
that
seemed
to
issue
from
the
black
depths
of
the
forest
to
advance
palpably
towards
the
walls
were
shaped
before
him
and
beneath
the
river
wound
about
the
town
swimming
to
the
flood
and
glowing
in
its
still
pools
like
molten
brass
and
as
the
water
mirrored
the
afterglow
and
sent
ripples
and
gouts
of
blood
against
the
shuddering
reeds
there
came
suddenly
the
piercing
the
loud
reiterated
summons
that
rose
and
fell
that
called
and
recalled
echoing
through
all
the
valley
crying
to
the
dead
as
the
last
note
rang
it
summoned
the
legion
from
the
river
and
the
graves
and
the
battlefield
the
host
floated
up
from
the
sea
the
centuries
swarmed
about
the
eagles
the
array
was
set
for
the
last
great
battle
behind
the
leaguer
of
the
mist
he
could
imagine
himself
still
wandering
through
the
dim
unknown
terrible
country
gazing
affrighted
at
the
hills
and
woods
that
seemed
to
have
put
on
an
unearthly
shape
stumbling
amongst
the
briars
that
caught
his
feet
he
lost
his
way
in
a
wild
country
and
the
red
light
that
blazed
up
from
the
furnace
on
the
mountains
only
showed
him
a
mysterious
land
in
which
he
strayed
aghast
with
the
sense
of
doom
weighing
upon
him
the
dry
mutter
of
the
trees
the
sound
of
an
unseen
brook
made
him
afraid
as
if
the
earth
spoke
of
his
sin
and
presently
he
was
fleeing
through
a
desolate
shadowy
wood
where
a
pale
light
flowed
from
the
moldering
stumps
a
dream
of
light
that
shed
a
ghostly
radiance
and
then
again
the
dark
summit
of
the
roman
fort
the
black
sheer
height
rising
above
the
valley
and
the
moonfire
streaming
around
the
ring
of
oaks
glowing
about
the
green
bastions
that
guarded
the
thicket
and
the
inner
place
the
room
in
which
he
sat
appeared
the
vision
the
trouble
of
the
wind
and
rain
without
was
but
illusion
the
noise
of
the
waves
in
the
seashell
passion
and
tears
and
adoration
and
the
glories
of
the
summer
night
returned
and
the
calm
sweet
face
of
the
woman
appeared
and
he
thrilled
at
the
soft
touch
of
her
hand
on
his
flesh
she
shone
as
if
she
had
floated
down
into
the
lane
from
the
moon
that
swam
between
films
of
cloud
above
the
black
circle
of
the
oaks
she
led
him
away
from
all
terror
and
despair
and
hate
and
gave
herself
to
him
with
rapture
showing
him
love
kissing
his
tears
away
pillowing
his
cheek
upon
her
breast
his
lips
dwelt
on
her
lips
his
mouth
upon
the
breath
of
her
mouth
her
arms
were
strained
about
him
and
oh
she
charmed
him
with
her
voice
with
sweet
kind
words
as
she
offered
her
sacrifice
how
her
scented
hair
fell
down
and
floated
over
his
eyes
and
there
was
a
marvelous
fire
called
the
moon
and
her
lips
were
aflame
and
her
eyes
shone
like
a
light
on
the
hills
all
beautiful
womanhood
had
come
to
him
in
the
lane
love
had
touched
him
in
the
dusk
and
had
flown
away
but
he
had
seen
the
splendor
and
the
glory
and
his
eyes
had
seen
the
enchanted
light
ave
atque
vale
the
old
words
sounded
in
his
ears
like
the
ending
of
a
chant
and
he
heard
the
music
close
once
only
in
his
weary
hapless
life
once
the
world
had
passed
away
and
he
had
known
her
the
dear
dear
annie
the
symbol
of
all
mystic
womanhood
the
heaviness
of
languor
still
oppressed
him
holding
him
back
amongst
these
old
memories
so
that
he
could
not
stir
from
his
place
oddly
there
seemed
something
unaccustomed
about
the
darkness
of
the
room
as
if
the
shadows
he
had
summoned
had
changed
the
aspect
of
the
walls
he
was
conscious
that
on
this
night
he
was
not
altogether
himself
fatigue
and
the
weariness
of
sleep
and
the
waking
vision
had
perplexed
him
he
remembered
how
once
or
twice
when
he
was
a
little
boy
startled
by
an
uneasy
dream
and
had
stared
with
a
frightened
gaze
into
nothingness
not
knowing
where
he
was
all
trembling
and
breathing
quick
till
he
touched
the
rail
of
his
bed
and
the
familiar
outlines
of
the
and
the
chiffonier
began
to
glimmer
out
of
the
gloom
so
now
he
touched
the
pile
of
manuscript
and
the
desk
at
which
he
had
worked
so
many
hours
and
felt
reassured
though
he
smiled
at
himself
and
he
felt
the
old
childish
dread
the
longing
to
cry
out
for
some
one
to
bring
a
candle
and
show
him
that
he
really
was
in
his
own
room
he
glanced
up
for
an
instant
expecting
to
see
perhaps
the
glitter
of
the
brass
gas
jet
that
was
fixed
on
the
wall
just
beside
his
bureau
but
it
was
too
dark
and
he
could
not
rouse
himself
and
make
the
effort
that
would
drive
the
cloud
and
the
muttering
thoughts
away
he
leant
back
again
picturing
the
wet
street
without
the
rain
driving
like
fountain
spray
about
the
gas
lamp
the
shrilling
of
the
wind
on
those
waste
places
to
the
north
it
was
strange
how
in
the
brick
and
stucco
desert
where
no
trees
were
he
all
the
time
imagined
the
noise
of
tossing
boughs
the
grinding
of
the
boughs
together
there
was
a
great
storm
and
tumult
in
this
wilderness
of
london
and
for
the
sound
of
the
rain
and
the
wind
he
could
not
hear
the
hum
and
jangle
of
the
trams
and
the
jar
and
shriek
of
the
garden
gates
as
they
opened
and
shut
but
he
could
imagine
his
street
the
desolate
curve
of
it
as
it
turned
northward
and
beyond
the
empty
suburban
roads
the
twinkling
villa
windows
the
ruined
field
the
broken
lane
and
then
yet
another
suburb
rising
a
solitary
glimmering
at
a
corner
and
the
plane
tree
lashing
its
boughs
and
driving
great
showers
against
the
glass
it
was
wonderful
to
think
of
for
when
these
remote
roads
were
ended
one
dipped
down
the
hill
into
the
open
country
into
the
dim
world
beyond
the
glint
of
friendly
fires
tonight
how
waste
they
were
these
wet
roads
edged
with
the
houses
with
shrubs
whipped
by
the
wind
against
one
another
against
the
paling
and
the
wall
there
the
wind
swayed
the
great
elms
scattered
on
the
sidewalk
the
remnants
of
the
old
stately
fields
and
beneath
each
tree
was
a
pool
of
wet
and
a
torment
of
raindrops
fell
with
every
gust
and
one
passed
through
the
red
avenues
perhaps
by
a
little
settlement
of
flickering
shops
and
passed
the
last
sentinel
wavering
lamp
and
the
road
became
a
ragged
lane
and
the
storm
screamed
from
hedge
to
hedge
across
the
open
fields
and
then
beyond
one
touched
again
upon
a
still
remoter
of
london
an
island
amidst
the
darkness
surrounded
by
its
pale
of
twinkling
starry
lights
he
remembered
his
wanderings
amongst
these
outposts
of
the
town
and
thought
how
desolate
all
their
ways
must
be
tonight
they
were
solitary
in
wet
and
wind
and
only
at
long
intervals
some
one
pattered
and
hurried
along
them
bending
his
eyes
down
to
escape
the
drift
of
rain
within
the
villas
behind
the
curtains
they
drew
about
the
fire
and
wondered
at
the
violence
of
the
storm
listening
for
each
great
gust
as
it
gathered
far
away
and
rocked
the
trees
and
at
last
rushed
with
a
huge
shock
against
their
walls
as
if
it
were
the
coming
of
the
sea
he
thought
of
himself
walking
as
he
had
often
walked
from
lamp
to
lamp
on
such
a
night
treasuring
his
lonely
thoughts
and
weighing
the
hard
task
awaiting
him
in
his
room
often
in
the
evening
after
a
long
labor
he
had
thrown
down
his
pen
in
utter
listlessness
feeling
that
he
could
struggle
no
more
with
ideas
and
words
and
he
had
gone
out
into
driving
rain
and
darkness
seeking
the
word
of
the
enigma
as
he
tramped
on
and
on
beneath
these
outer
battlements
of
london
or
on
some
grey
afternoon
in
march
or
november
he
had
sickened
of
the
dull
monotony
and
the
stagnant
life
that
he
saw
from
his
window
and
had
taken
his
design
with
him
to
the
lonely
places
halting
now
and
again
by
a
gate
and
pausing
in
the
shelter
of
a
hedge
through
which
the
austere
wind
shivered
while
perhaps
he
dreamed
of
sicily
or
of
sunlight
on
the
provençal
olives
often
as
he
strayed
solitary
from
street
to
field
and
passed
the
syrian
fig
tree
imprisoned
in
britain
nailed
to
an
ungenial
wall
the
solution
of
the
puzzle
became
evident
and
he
laughed
and
hurried
home
eager
to
make
the
page
speak
to
note
the
song
he
had
heard
on
his
way
sometimes
he
had
spent
many
hours
treading
this
edge
and
brim
of
london
now
lost
amidst
the
dun
fields
watching
the
bushes
shaken
by
the
wind
and
now
looking
down
from
a
height
whence
he
could
see
the
dim
waves
of
the
town
and
a
barbaric
water
tower
rising
from
a
hill
and
the
cloud
of
smoke
that
seemed
blown
up
from
the
streets
into
the
sky
there
were
certain
ways
and
places
that
he
had
cherished
he
loved
a
great
old
common
that
stood
on
high
ground
curtained
about
with
ancient
spacious
houses
of
red
brick
and
their
cedarn
gardens
and
there
was
on
the
road
that
led
to
this
common
a
space
of
ragged
uneven
ground
with
a
pool
and
a
twisted
oak
and
here
he
had
often
stayed
in
autumn
and
looked
across
the
mist
and
the
valley
at
the
great
theatre
of
the
sunset
where
a
red
cloud
like
a
charging
knight
shone
and
conquered
a
purple
dragon
shape
and
golden
lances
glittered
in
a
field
of
faerie
green
or
sometimes
when
the
unending
prospect
of
trim
monotonous
modern
streets
had
wearied
him
he
had
found
an
immense
refreshment
in
the
discovery
of
a
forgotten
hamlet
left
in
a
hollow
while
all
new
london
pressed
and
surged
on
every
side
threatening
the
rest
of
the
red
roofs
with
its
vulgar
growth
these
little
peaceful
houses
huddled
together
beneath
the
shelter
of
trees
with
their
bulging
leaded
windows
and
uneven
roofs
somehow
brought
back
to
him
the
sense
of
the
country
and
soothed
him
with
the
thought
of
the
old
white
or
grey
the
homes
of
quiet
lives
harbors
where
perhaps
no
tormenting
thoughts
ever
broke
in
for
he
had
instinctively
determined
that
there
was
neither
rest
nor
health
in
all
the
arid
waste
of
streets
about
him
it
seemed
as
if
in
those
dull
rows
of
dwellings
in
the
prim
new
villas
red
and
white
and
staring
there
must
be
a
leaven
working
which
transformed
all
to
base
vulgarity
beneath
the
dull
sad
slates
behind
the
blistered
doors
love
turned
to
squalid
intrigue
mirth
to
drunken
clamor
and
the
mystery
of
life
became
a
common
thing
religion
was
sought
for
in
the
greasy
piety
and
flatulent
oratory
of
the
independent
chapel
the
stuccoed
nightmare
of
the
doric
columns
nothing
fine
nothing
rare
nothing
exquisite
it
seemed
could
exist
in
the
weltering
suburban
sea
in
the
habitations
which
had
risen
from
the
stench
and
slime
of
the
brickfields
it
was
as
if
the
sickening
fumes
that
steamed
from
the
burning
bricks
had
been
sublimed
into
the
shape
of
houses
and
those
who
lived
in
these
grey
places
could
also
claim
kinship
with
the
putrid
mud
hence
he
had
delighted
in
the
few
remains
of
the
past
that
he
could
find
still
surviving
on
the
suburb
edge
in
the
grave
old
houses
that
stood
apart
from
the
road
in
the
moldering
taverns
of
the
eighteenth
century
in
the
huddled
hamlets
that
had
preserved
only
the
glow
and
the
sunlight
of
all
the
years
that
had
passed
over
them
it
appeared
to
him
that
vulgarity
and
greasiness
and
squalor
had
come
with
a
flood
that
not
only
the
good
but
also
the
evil
in
man
heart
had
been
made
common
and
ugly
that
a
sordid
scum
was
mingled
with
all
the
springs
of
death
as
of
life
it
would
be
alike
futile
to
search
amongst
these
mean
houses
for
a
splendid
sinner
as
for
a
splendid
saint
the
very
vices
of
these
people
smelt
of
cabbage
water
and
a
pothouse
vomit
and
so
he
had
often
fled
away
from
the
serried
maze
that
encircled
him
seeking
for
the
old
and
worn
and
significant
as
an
antiquary
looks
for
the
fragments
of
the
roman
temple
amidst
the
modern
shops
in
some
way
the
gusts
of
wind
and
the
beating
rain
of
the
night
reminded
him
of
an
old
house
that
had
often
attracted
him
with
a
strange
indefinable
curiosity
he
had
found
it
on
a
grim
grey
day
in
march
when
he
had
gone
out
under
a
sky
cowering
from
a
dry
freezing
wind
that
brought
with
it
the
gloom
and
the
doom
of
far
unhappy
siberian
plains
more
than
ever
that
day
the
suburb
had
oppressed
him
insignificant
detestable
repulsive
to
body
and
mind
it
was
the
only
hell
that
a
vulgar
age
could
conceive
or
make
an
inferno
created
not
by
dante
but
by
the
he
had
gone
out
to
the
north
and
when
he
lifted
up
his
eyes
again
he
found
that
he
had
chanced
to
turn
up
by
one
of
the
little
lanes
that
still
strayed
across
the
broken
fields
he
had
never
chosen
this
path
before
because
the
lane
at
its
outlet
was
so
wholly
degraded
and
offensive
littered
with
rusty
tins
and
broken
crockery
and
hedged
in
with
a
paling
fashioned
out
of
scraps
of
wire
rotting
timber
and
bending
rails
but
on
this
day
by
happy
chance
he
had
fled
from
the
high
road
by
the
first
opening
that
offered
and
he
no
longer
groped
his
way
amongst
obscene
refuse
sickened
by
the
bloated
bodies
of
dead
dogs
and
fetid
odors
from
unclean
decay
but
the
malpassage
had
become
a
peaceful
winding
lane
with
warm
shelter
beneath
its
banks
from
the
dismal
wind
for
a
mile
he
had
walked
quietly
and
then
a
turn
in
the
road
showed
him
a
little
glen
or
hollow
watered
by
such
a
tiny
rushing
brooklet
as
his
own
woods
knew
and
beyond
alas
the
glaring
foreguard
of
a
new
neighborhood
raw
red
villas
and
then
a
row
of
lamentable
shops
but
as
he
was
about
to
turn
back
in
the
hope
of
finding
some
other
outlet
his
attention
was
charmed
by
a
small
house
that
stood
back
a
little
from
the
road
on
his
right
hand
there
had
been
a
white
gate
but
the
paint
had
long
faded
to
grey
and
black
and
the
wood
crumbled
under
the
touch
and
only
moss
marked
out
the
lines
of
the
drive
the
iron
railing
round
the
lawn
had
fallen
and
the
poor
were
choked
with
grass
and
a
faded
growth
of
weeds
but
here
and
there
a
rosebush
lingered
amidst
suckers
that
had
sprung
grossly
from
the
root
and
on
each
side
of
the
hall
door
were
box
trees
untrimmed
ragged
but
still
green
the
slate
roof
was
all
stained
and
livid
blotched
with
the
drippings
of
a
great
elm
that
stood
at
one
corner
of
the
neglected
lawn
and
marks
of
damp
and
decay
were
thick
on
the
uneven
walls
which
had
been
washed
yellow
many
years
before
there
was
a
porch
of
trellis
work
before
the
door
and
lucian
had
seen
it
rock
in
the
wind
swaying
as
if
every
gust
must
drive
it
down
there
were
two
windows
on
the
ground
floor
one
on
each
side
of
the
door
and
two
above
with
a
blind
space
where
a
central
window
had
been
blocked
up
this
poor
and
desolate
house
had
fascinated
him
ancient
and
poor
and
fallen
disfigured
by
the
slate
roof
and
the
yellow
wash
that
had
replaced
the
old
mellow
dipping
tiles
and
the
warm
red
walls
and
disfigured
again
by
spots
and
patches
of
decay
it
seemed
as
if
its
happy
days
were
for
ever
ended
to
lucian
it
appealed
with
a
sense
of
doom
and
horror
the
black
streaks
that
crept
upon
the
walls
and
the
green
drift
upon
the
roof
appeared
not
so
much
the
work
of
foul
weather
and
dripping
boughs
as
the
outward
signs
of
evil
working
and
creeping
in
the
lives
of
those
within
the
stage
seemed
to
him
decked
for
doom
painted
with
the
symbols
of
tragedy
and
he
wondered
as
he
looked
whether
any
one
were
so
unhappy
as
to
live
there
still
there
were
torn
blinds
in
the
windows
but
he
had
asked
himself
who
could
be
so
brave
as
to
sit
in
that
room
darkened
by
the
dreary
box
and
listen
of
winter
nights
to
the
rain
upon
the
window
and
the
moaning
of
wind
amongst
the
tossing
boughs
that
beat
against
the
roof
he
could
not
imagine
that
any
chamber
in
such
a
house
was
habitable
here
the
dead
had
lain
through
the
white
blind
the
thin
light
had
filtered
on
the
rigid
mouth
and
still
the
floor
must
be
wet
with
tears
and
still
that
great
rocking
elm
echoed
the
groaning
and
the
sobs
of
those
who
watched
no
doubt
the
damp
was
rising
and
the
odor
of
the
earth
filled
the
house
and
made
such
as
entered
draw
back
foreseeing
the
hour
of
death
often
the
thought
of
this
strange
old
house
had
haunted
him
he
had
imagined
the
empty
rooms
where
a
heavy
paper
peeled
from
the
walls
and
hung
in
dark
strips
and
he
could
not
believe
that
a
light
ever
shone
from
those
windows
that
stared
black
and
glittering
on
the
neglected
lawn
but
tonight
the
wet
and
the
storm
seemed
curiously
to
bring
the
image
of
the
place
before
him
and
as
the
wind
sounded
he
thought
how
unhappy
those
must
be
if
any
there
were
who
sat
in
the
musty
chambers
by
a
flickering
light
and
listened
to
the
moaning
and
beating
and
weeping
on
the
walls
and
tonight
was
saturday
night
and
there
was
about
that
phrase
something
that
muttered
of
the
condemned
cell
of
the
agony
of
a
doomed
man
ghastly
to
his
eyes
was
the
conception
of
any
one
sitting
in
that
room
to
the
right
of
the
door
behind
the
larger
box
tree
where
the
wall
was
cracked
above
the
window
and
smeared
with
a
black
stain
in
an
ugly
shape
he
knew
how
foolish
it
had
been
in
the
first
place
to
trouble
his
mind
with
such
conceits
of
a
dreary
cottage
on
the
outskirts
of
london
and
it
was
more
foolish
now
to
meditate
these
things
fantasies
feigned
forms
the
issue
of
a
sad
mood
and
a
bleak
day
of
spring
for
soon
in
a
few
moments
he
was
to
rise
to
a
new
life
he
was
but
reckoning
up
the
account
of
his
past
and
when
the
light
came
he
was
to
think
no
more
of
sorrow
and
heaviness
of
real
or
imagined
terrors
he
had
stayed
too
long
in
london
and
he
would
once
more
taste
the
breath
of
the
hills
and
see
the
river
winding
in
the
long
lovely
valley
ah
he
would
go
home
something
like
a
thrill
the
thrill
of
fear
passed
over
him
as
he
remembered
that
there
was
no
home
it
was
in
the
winter
a
year
and
a
half
after
his
arrival
in
town
that
he
had
suffered
the
loss
of
his
father
he
lay
for
many
days
prostrate
overwhelmed
with
sorrow
and
with
the
thought
that
now
indeed
he
was
utterly
alone
in
the
world
miss
deacon
was
to
live
with
another
cousin
in
yorkshire
the
old
home
was
at
last
ended
and
done
he
felt
sorry
that
he
had
not
written
more
frequently
to
his
father
there
were
things
in
his
cousin
letters
that
had
made
his
heart
sore
your
poor
father
was
always
looking
for
your
letters
she
wrote
they
used
to
cheer
him
so
much
he
nearly
broke
down
when
you
sent
him
that
money
last
christmas
he
got
it
into
his
head
that
you
were
starving
yourself
to
send
it
him
he
was
hoping
so
much
that
you
would
have
come
down
this
christmas
and
kept
asking
me
about
the
months
ago
it
was
not
only
his
father
that
had
died
but
with
him
the
last
strong
link
was
broken
and
the
past
life
the
days
of
his
boyhood
grew
faint
as
a
dream
with
his
father
his
mother
died
again
and
the
long
years
died
the
time
of
his
innocence
the
memory
of
affection
he
was
sorry
that
his
letters
had
gone
home
so
rarely
it
hurt
him
to
imagine
his
father
looking
out
when
the
post
came
in
the
morning
and
forced
to
be
sad
because
there
was
nothing
but
he
had
never
thought
that
his
father
valued
the
few
lines
that
he
wrote
and
indeed
it
was
often
difficult
to
know
what
to
say
it
would
have
been
useless
to
write
of
those
agonizing
nights
when
the
pen
seemed
an
awkward
and
outlandish
instrument
when
every
effort
ended
in
shameful
defeat
or
of
the
happier
hours
when
at
last
wonder
appeared
and
the
line
glowed
crowned
and
exalted
to
poor
taylor
such
tales
would
have
seemed
but
trivial
histories
of
some
oriental
game
like
an
odd
story
from
a
land
where
men
have
time
for
the
infinitely
little
and
can
seriously
make
a
science
of
arranging
blossoms
in
a
jar
and
discuss
perfumes
instead
of
politics
it
would
have
been
useless
to
write
to
the
rectory
of
his
only
interest
and
so
he
wrote
seldom
and
then
he
had
been
sorry
because
he
could
never
write
again
and
never
see
his
home
he
had
wondered
whether
he
would
have
gone
down
to
the
old
place
at
christmas
if
his
father
had
lived
it
was
curious
how
common
things
evoked
the
bitterest
griefs
but
his
father
anxiety
that
the
should
be
good
and
ready
for
him
had
brought
the
tears
into
his
eyes
he
could
hear
him
saying
in
a
nervous
voice
that
attempted
to
be
cheerful
i
suppose
you
will
be
thinking
of
the
christmas
puddings
soon
jane
you
remember
how
fond
lucian
used
to
be
of
i
hope
we
shall
see
him
this
december
no
doubt
poor
miss
deacon
paled
with
rage
at
the
suggestion
that
she
should
make
christmas
pudding
in
july
and
returned
a
sharp
answer
but
it
was
pathetic
the
wind
wailed
and
the
rain
dashed
and
beat
again
and
again
upon
the
window
he
imagined
that
all
his
thoughts
of
home
of
the
old
rectory
amongst
the
elms
had
conjured
into
his
mind
the
sound
of
the
storm
upon
the
trees
for
tonight
very
clearly
he
heard
the
creaking
of
the
boughs
the
noise
of
boughs
moaning
and
beating
and
weeping
on
the
walls
and
even
a
pattering
of
wet
on
wet
earth
as
if
there
were
a
shrub
near
the
window
that
shook
off
the
raindrops
before
the
gust
that
thrill
as
it
were
a
shudder
of
fear
passed
over
him
again
and
he
knew
not
what
had
made
him
afraid
there
were
some
dark
shadow
on
his
mind
that
saddened
him
it
seemed
as
if
a
vague
memory
of
terrible
days
hung
like
a
cloud
over
his
thought
but
it
was
all
indefinite
perhaps
the
last
grim
and
ragged
edge
of
the
melancholy
wrack
that
had
swelled
over
his
life
and
the
bygone
years
he
shivered
and
tried
to
rouse
himself
and
drive
away
the
sense
of
dread
and
shame
that
seemed
so
real
and
so
awful
and
yet
he
could
not
grasp
it
but
the
torpor
of
sleep
the
burden
of
the
work
that
he
had
ended
a
few
hours
before
still
weighed
down
his
limb
and
bound
his
thoughts
he
could
scarcely
believe
that
he
had
been
busy
at
his
desk
a
little
while
ago
and
that
just
before
the
winter
day
closed
it
and
the
rain
began
to
fall
he
had
laid
down
the
pen
with
a
sigh
of
relief
and
had
slept
in
his
chair
it
was
rather
as
if
he
had
slumbered
deeply
through
a
long
and
weary
night
as
if
an
awful
vision
of
flame
and
darkness
and
the
worm
that
dieth
not
had
come
to
him
sleeping
but
he
would
dwell
no
more
on
the
darkness
he
went
back
to
the
early
days
in
london
when
he
had
said
farewell
to
the
hills
and
to
the
waterpools
and
had
set
to
work
in
this
little
room
in
the
dingy
street
how
he
had
toiled
and
labored
at
the
desk
before
him
he
had
put
away
the
old
wild
hopes
of
the
masterpiece
conceived
and
executed
in
a
fury
of
inspiration
wrought
out
in
one
white
heat
of
creative
joy
it
was
enough
if
by
dint
of
long
perseverance
and
singleness
of
desire
he
could
at
last
in
pain
and
agony
and
despair
after
failure
and
disappointment
and
effort
constantly
renewed
fashion
something
of
which
he
need
not
be
ashamed
he
had
put
himself
to
school
again
and
had
with
what
patience
he
could
command
ground
his
teeth
into
the
rudiments
resolved
that
at
last
he
would
test
out
the
heart
of
the
mystery
they
were
good
nights
to
remember
these
he
was
glad
to
think
of
the
little
ugly
room
with
its
silly
and
its
furniture
lighted
up
while
he
sat
at
the
bureau
and
wrote
on
into
the
cold
stillness
of
the
london
morning
when
the
flickering
lamplight
and
the
daystar
shone
together
it
was
an
interminable
labor
and
he
had
always
known
it
to
be
as
hopeless
as
alchemy
the
gold
the
great
and
glowing
masterpiece
would
never
shine
amongst
the
dead
ashes
and
smoking
efforts
of
the
crucible
but
in
the
course
of
the
life
in
the
interval
between
the
failures
he
might
possibly
discover
curious
things
these
were
the
good
nights
that
he
could
look
back
on
without
any
fear
or
shame
when
he
had
been
happy
and
content
on
a
diet
of
bread
and
tea
and
tobacco
and
could
hear
of
some
imbecility
passing
into
its
hundredth
thousand
and
laugh
cheerfully
if
only
that
last
page
had
been
imagined
aright
if
the
phrases
noted
in
the
still
hours
rang
out
their
music
when
he
read
them
in
the
morning
he
remembered
the
drolleries
and
fantasies
that
the
worthy
miss
deacon
used
to
write
to
him
and
how
he
had
grinned
at
her
words
of
reproof
admonition
and
advice
she
had
once
instigated
dolly
to
pay
him
a
visit
and
that
young
prop
of
respectability
had
talked
about
the
extraordinary
running
of
bolter
at
the
scurragh
meeting
in
ireland
and
then
glancing
at
lucian
books
had
inquired
whether
any
of
them
had
warm
bits
he
had
been
kind
though
patronizing
and
seemed
to
have
moved
freely
in
the
most
brilliant
society
of
stoke
newington
he
had
not
been
able
to
give
any
information
as
to
the
present
condition
of
edgar
allan
poe
old
school
it
appeared
eventually
that
his
report
at
home
had
not
been
a
very
favorable
one
for
no
invitation
to
high
tea
had
followed
as
miss
deacon
had
hoped
the
dollys
knew
many
nice
people
who
were
well
off
and
lucian
cousin
as
she
afterwards
said
had
done
best
to
introduce
him
to
the
of
those
northern
suburbs
but
after
the
visit
of
the
young
dolly
with
what
joy
he
had
returned
to
the
treasures
which
he
had
concealed
from
profane
eyes
he
had
looked
out
and
seen
his
visitor
on
board
the
tram
at
the
street
corner
and
he
laughed
out
loud
and
locked
his
door
there
had
been
moments
when
he
was
lonely
and
wished
to
hear
again
the
sound
of
friendly
speech
but
after
such
an
irruption
of
suburban
futility
it
was
a
keen
delight
to
feel
that
he
was
secure
on
his
tower
that
he
could
absorb
himself
in
his
wonderful
task
as
safe
and
silent
as
if
he
were
in
but
there
was
one
period
that
he
dared
not
revive
he
could
no
bear
to
think
of
those
weeks
of
desolation
and
terror
in
the
winter
after
his
coming
to
london
his
mind
was
sluggish
and
he
could
not
quite
remember
how
many
years
had
passed
since
that
dismal
experience
it
sounded
all
an
old
story
but
yet
it
was
still
vivid
a
flaming
scroll
of
terror
from
which
he
turned
his
eyes
away
one
awful
scene
glowed
into
his
memory
and
he
could
not
shut
out
the
sight
of
an
orgy
of
dusky
figures
whirling
in
a
ring
of
lurid
naphtha
flares
blazing
in
the
darkness
of
great
glittering
lamps
like
infernal
thuribles
very
slowly
swaying
in
a
violent
blast
of
air
and
there
was
something
else
something
which
he
could
not
remember
but
it
filled
him
with
terror
but
it
slunk
in
the
dark
places
of
his
soul
as
a
wild
beast
crouches
in
the
depths
of
a
cave
again
and
without
reason
he
began
to
image
to
himself
that
old
moldering
house
in
the
field
with
what
a
loud
incessant
noise
the
wind
must
be
clamoring
about
on
this
fearful
night
how
the
great
elm
swayed
and
cried
in
the
storm
and
the
rain
dashed
and
pattered
on
the
windows
and
dripped
on
the
sodden
earth
from
the
shaking
shrubs
beside
the
door
he
moved
uneasily
on
his
chair
and
struggled
to
put
the
picture
out
of
his
thoughts
but
in
spite
of
himself
he
saw
the
stained
uneven
walls
that
ugly
blot
of
mildew
above
the
window
and
perhaps
a
feeble
gleam
of
light
filtered
through
the
blind
and
some
one
unhappy
above
all
and
for
ever
lost
sat
within
the
dismal
room
or
rather
every
window
was
black
without
a
glimmer
of
hope
and
he
who
was
shut
in
thick
darkness
heard
the
wind
and
the
rain
and
the
noise
of
the
moaning
and
beating
and
weeping
on
the
walls
for
all
his
effort
the
impression
would
not
leave
him
and
as
he
sat
before
his
desk
looking
into
the
vague
darkness
he
could
almost
see
that
chamber
which
he
had
so
often
imagined
the
low
whitewashed
ceiling
held
up
by
a
heavy
beam
the
smears
of
smoke
and
long
usage
the
cracks
and
fissures
of
the
plaster
old
furniture
shabby
deplorable
battered
stood
about
the
room
there
was
a
horsehair
sofa
worn
and
tottering
and
a
dismal
paper
patterned
in
a
livid
red
blackened
and
moldered
near
the
floor
and
peeled
off
and
hung
in
strips
from
the
dank
walls
and
there
was
that
odor
of
decay
of
the
rank
soil
steaming
of
rotting
wood
a
vapor
that
choked
the
breath
and
made
the
heart
full
of
fear
and
heaviness
lucian
again
shivered
with
a
thrill
of
dread
he
was
afraid
that
he
had
overworked
himself
and
that
he
was
suffering
from
the
first
symptoms
of
grave
illness
his
mind
dwelt
on
confused
and
terrible
recollections
and
with
a
mad
ingenuity
gave
form
and
substance
to
phantoms
and
even
now
he
drew
a
long
breath
almost
imagining
that
the
air
in
his
room
was
heavy
and
noisome
that
it
entered
his
nostrils
with
some
taint
of
the
crypt
and
his
body
was
still
languid
and
though
he
made
a
half
motion
to
rise
he
could
not
find
enough
energy
for
the
effort
and
he
sank
again
into
the
chair
at
all
events
he
would
think
no
more
of
that
sad
house
in
the
field
he
would
return
to
those
long
struggles
with
letters
to
the
happy
nights
when
he
had
gained
victories
he
remembered
something
of
his
escape
from
the
desolation
and
the
worse
than
desolation
that
had
obsessed
him
during
that
first
winter
in
london
he
had
gone
free
one
bleak
morning
in
february
and
after
those
dreary
terrible
weeks
the
desk
and
the
heap
and
litter
of
papers
had
once
more
engulfed
and
absorbed
him
and
in
the
succeeding
summer
of
a
night
when
he
lay
awake
and
listened
to
the
birds
shining
images
came
wantonly
to
him
for
an
hour
while
the
dawn
brightened
he
had
felt
the
presence
of
an
age
the
resurrection
of
the
life
that
the
green
fields
had
hidden
and
his
heart
stirred
for
joy
when
he
knew
that
he
held
and
possessed
all
the
loveliness
that
had
so
long
moldered
he
could
scarcely
fall
asleep
for
eager
and
leaping
thoughts
and
as
soon
as
his
breakfast
was
over
he
went
out
and
bought
paper
and
pens
of
a
certain
celestial
stationer
in
notting
hill
the
street
was
not
changed
as
he
passed
to
and
fro
on
his
errand
the
rattling
wagons
jostled
by
at
intervals
a
rare
hansom
came
spinning
down
from
london
there
sounded
the
same
hum
and
jangle
of
the
gliding
trams
the
languid
life
of
the
pavement
was
unaltered
a
few
people
without
salience
or
possible
description
lounged
and
walked
from
east
to
west
and
from
west
to
east
or
slowly
dropped
into
the
byways
to
wander
in
the
black
waste
to
the
north
or
perhaps
go
astray
in
the
systems
that
stretched
towards
the
river
he
glanced
down
these
as
he
passed
and
was
astonished
as
always
at
their
mysterious
and
desert
aspect
some
were
utterly
empty
lines
of
neat
appalling
residences
trim
and
garnished
as
if
for
occupation
edging
the
white
glaring
road
and
not
a
soul
was
abroad
and
not
a
sound
broke
their
stillness
it
was
a
picture
of
the
desolation
of
midnight
lighted
up
but
empty
and
waste
as
the
most
profound
and
solemn
hours
before
the
day
other
of
these
of
older
settlement
were
furnished
with
more
important
houses
standing
far
back
from
the
pavement
each
in
a
little
wood
of
greenery
and
thus
one
might
look
down
as
through
a
forest
vista
and
see
a
way
smooth
and
guarded
with
low
walls
and
yet
untrodden
and
all
a
leafy
silence
here
and
there
in
some
of
these
echoing
roads
a
figure
seemed
lazily
advancing
in
the
distance
hesitating
and
delaying
as
if
lost
in
the
labyrinth
it
was
difficult
to
say
which
were
the
more
dismal
these
deserted
streets
that
wandered
away
to
right
and
left
or
the
great
main
thoroughfare
with
its
narcotic
and
shadowy
life
for
the
latter
appeared
vast
interminable
grey
and
those
who
traveled
by
it
were
scarcely
real
the
bodies
of
the
living
but
rather
the
uncertain
and
misty
shapes
that
come
and
go
across
the
desert
in
an
eastern
tale
when
men
look
up
from
the
sand
and
see
a
caravan
pass
them
all
in
silence
without
a
cry
or
a
greeting
so
they
passed
and
repassed
each
other
on
those
pavements
appearing
and
vanishing
each
intent
on
his
own
secret
and
wrapped
in
obscurity
one
might
have
sworn
that
not
a
man
saw
his
neighbor
who
met
him
or
jostled
him
that
here
every
one
was
a
phantom
for
the
other
though
the
lines
of
their
paths
crossed
and
recrossed
and
their
eyes
stared
like
the
eyes
of
live
men
when
two
went
by
together
they
mumbled
and
cast
distrustful
glances
behind
them
as
though
afraid
all
the
world
was
an
enemy
and
the
pattering
of
feet
was
like
the
noise
of
a
shower
of
rain
curious
appearances
and
simulations
of
life
gathered
at
points
in
the
road
for
at
intervals
the
villas
ended
and
shops
began
in
a
dismal
row
and
looked
so
hopeless
that
one
wondered
who
could
buy
there
were
women
fluttering
uneasily
about
the
greengrocers
and
shabby
things
in
rusty
black
touched
and
retouched
the
red
lumps
that
an
unshaven
butcher
offered
and
already
in
the
corner
public
there
was
a
confused
noise
with
a
tossing
of
voices
that
rose
and
fell
like
a
jewish
chant
with
the
senseless
stir
of
marionettes
jerked
into
an
imitation
of
gaiety
then
in
crossing
a
side
street
that
seemed
like
grey
in
stone
he
trespassed
from
one
world
to
another
for
an
old
decayed
house
amidst
its
garden
held
the
opposite
corner
the
laurels
had
grown
into
black
skeletons
patched
with
green
drift
the
ilex
gloomed
over
the
porch
the
deodar
had
blighted
the
dark
ivies
swarmed
over
an
and
a
brown
clustering
fungus
sprang
in
gross
masses
on
the
lawn
showing
where
the
roots
of
dead
trees
moldered
the
blue
verandah
the
blue
balcony
over
the
door
had
faded
to
grey
and
the
stucco
was
blotched
with
ugly
marks
of
weather
and
a
dank
smell
of
decay
that
vapor
of
black
rotten
earth
in
old
town
gardens
hung
heavy
about
the
gates
and
then
a
row
of
musty
villas
had
pushed
out
in
shops
to
the
pavement
and
the
things
in
faded
black
buzzed
and
stirred
about
the
limp
cabbages
and
the
red
lumps
of
meat
it
was
the
same
terrible
street
whose
pavements
he
had
trodden
so
often
where
sunshine
seemed
but
a
gaudy
light
where
the
fume
of
burning
bricks
always
drifted
on
black
winter
nights
he
had
seen
the
sparse
lights
glimmering
through
the
rain
and
drawing
close
together
as
the
dreary
road
vanished
in
long
perspective
perhaps
this
was
its
most
appropriate
moment
when
nothing
of
its
smug
villas
and
skeleton
shops
remained
but
the
bright
patches
of
their
windows
when
the
old
house
amongst
its
moldering
shrubs
was
but
a
dark
cloud
and
the
streets
to
the
north
and
south
seemed
like
starry
wastes
beyond
them
the
blackness
of
infinity
always
in
the
daylight
it
had
been
to
him
abhorred
and
abominable
and
its
grey
houses
and
purlieus
had
been
sproutings
an
efflorescence
of
horrible
decay
but
on
that
bright
morning
neither
the
dreadful
street
nor
those
who
moved
about
it
appalled
him
he
returned
joyously
to
his
den
and
reverently
laid
out
the
paper
on
his
desk
the
world
about
him
was
but
a
grey
shadow
hovering
on
a
shining
wall
its
noises
were
faint
as
the
rustling
of
trees
in
a
distant
wood
the
lovely
and
exquisite
forms
of
those
who
served
the
amber
venus
were
his
distinct
clear
and
manifest
visions
and
for
one
amongst
them
who
came
to
him
in
a
fire
of
bronze
hair
his
heart
stirred
with
the
adoration
of
love
she
it
was
who
stood
forth
from
all
the
rest
and
fell
down
prostrate
before
the
radiant
form
in
amber
drawing
out
her
pins
in
curious
gold
her
glowing
brooches
of
enamel
and
pouring
from
a
silver
box
all
her
treasures
of
jewels
and
precious
stones
chrysoberyl
and
sardonyx
opal
and
diamond
topaz
and
pearl
and
then
she
stripped
from
her
body
her
precious
robes
and
stood
before
the
goddess
in
the
glowing
mist
of
her
hair
praying
that
to
her
who
had
given
all
and
came
naked
to
the
shrine
love
might
be
given
and
the
grace
of
venus
and
when
at
last
after
strange
adventures
her
prayer
was
granted
then
when
the
sweet
light
came
from
the
sea
and
her
lover
turned
at
dawn
to
that
bronze
glory
he
saw
beside
him
a
little
statuette
of
amber
and
in
the
shrine
far
in
britain
where
the
black
rains
stained
the
marble
they
found
the
splendid
and
sumptuous
statue
of
the
golden
venus
the
last
fine
robe
of
silk
that
the
lady
had
dedicated
falling
from
her
fingers
and
the
jewels
lying
at
her
feet
and
her
face
was
like
the
lady
face
when
the
sun
had
brightened
it
on
that
day
of
her
devotion
the
bronze
mist
glimmered
before
lucian
eyes
he
felt
as
though
the
soft
floating
hair
touched
his
forehead
and
his
lips
and
his
hands
the
fume
of
burning
bricks
the
reek
of
cabbage
water
never
reached
his
nostrils
that
were
filled
with
the
perfume
of
rare
unguents
with
the
breath
of
the
violet
sea
in
italy
his
pleasure
was
an
inebriation
an
ecstasy
of
joy
that
destroyed
all
the
vile
hottentot
kraals
and
mud
avenues
as
with
one
white
lightning
flash
and
through
the
hours
of
that
day
he
sat
enthralled
not
contriving
a
story
with
patient
art
but
rapt
into
another
time
and
entranced
by
the
urgent
gleam
in
the
lady
eyes
the
little
tale
of
amber
had
at
last
issued
from
a
humble
office
in
the
spring
after
his
father
death
the
author
was
utterly
unknown
the
author
murray
was
a
wholesale
stationer
and
printer
in
process
of
development
so
that
lucian
was
astonished
when
the
book
became
a
moderate
success
the
reviewers
had
been
sadly
irritated
and
even
now
he
recollected
with
cheerfulness
an
article
in
an
influential
daily
paper
an
article
pleasantly
headed
where
are
the
disinfectants
and
then
but
all
the
months
afterwards
seemed
doubtful
there
were
only
broken
revelations
of
the
laborious
hours
renewed
and
the
white
nights
when
he
had
seen
the
moonlight
fade
and
the
gaslight
grow
wan
at
the
approach
of
dawn
he
listened
surely
that
was
the
sound
of
rain
falling
on
sodden
ground
the
heavy
sound
of
great
swollen
drops
driven
down
from
wet
leaves
by
the
gust
of
wind
and
then
again
the
strain
of
boughs
sang
above
the
tumult
of
the
air
there
was
a
doleful
noise
as
if
the
storm
shook
the
masts
of
a
ship
he
had
only
to
get
up
and
look
out
of
the
window
and
he
would
see
the
treeless
empty
street
and
the
rain
starring
the
puddles
under
the
but
he
would
wait
a
little
while
he
tried
to
think
why
in
spite
of
all
his
resolutions
a
dark
horror
seemed
to
brood
more
and
more
over
all
his
mind
how
often
he
had
sat
and
worked
on
just
such
nights
as
this
contented
if
the
words
were
in
accord
though
the
wind
might
wail
though
the
air
were
black
with
rain
even
about
the
little
book
that
he
had
made
there
seemed
some
taint
some
shuddering
memory
that
came
to
him
across
the
gulf
of
forgetfulness
somehow
the
remembrance
of
the
offering
to
venus
of
the
phrases
that
he
had
so
lovingly
invented
brought
back
again
the
dusky
figures
that
danced
in
the
orgy
beneath
the
brassy
glittering
lamps
and
again
the
naphtha
flares
showed
the
way
to
the
sad
house
in
the
fields
and
the
red
glare
lit
up
the
mildewed
walls
and
the
black
hopeless
windows
he
gasped
for
breath
he
seemed
to
inhale
a
heavy
air
that
reeked
of
decay
and
rottenness
and
the
odor
of
the
clay
was
in
his
nostrils
that
unknown
cloud
that
had
darkened
his
thoughts
grew
blacker
and
engulfed
him
despair
was
heavy
upon
him
his
heart
fainted
with
a
horrible
dread
in
a
moment
it
seemed
a
veil
would
be
drawn
away
and
certain
awful
things
would
appear
he
strove
to
rise
from
his
chair
to
cry
out
but
he
could
not
deep
deep
the
darkness
closed
upon
him
and
the
storm
sounded
far
away
the
roman
fort
surged
up
terrific
and
he
saw
the
writhing
boughs
in
a
ring
and
behind
them
a
glow
and
heat
of
fire
there
were
hideous
shapes
that
swarmed
in
the
thicket
of
the
oaks
they
called
and
beckoned
to
him
and
rose
into
the
air
into
the
flame
that
was
smitten
from
heaven
about
the
walls
and
amongst
them
was
the
form
of
the
beloved
but
jets
of
flame
issued
from
her
breasts
and
beside
her
was
a
horrible
old
woman
naked
and
they
too
summoned
him
to
mount
the
hill
he
heard
burrows
whispering
of
the
strange
things
that
had
been
found
in
old
gibbon
cottage
obscene
figures
and
unknown
contrivances
she
was
a
witch
he
said
and
the
mistress
of
witches
he
fought
against
the
nightmare
against
the
illusion
that
bewildered
him
all
his
life
he
thought
had
been
an
evil
dream
and
for
the
common
world
he
had
fashioned
an
unreal
red
garment
that
burned
in
his
eyes
truth
and
the
dream
were
so
mingled
that
now
he
could
not
divide
one
from
the
other
he
had
let
annie
drink
his
soul
beneath
the
hill
on
the
night
when
the
moonfire
shone
but
he
had
not
surely
seen
her
exalted
in
the
flame
the
queen
of
the
sabbath
dimly
he
remembered
burrows
coming
to
see
him
in
london
but
had
he
not
imagined
all
the
rest
again
he
found
himself
in
the
dusky
lane
and
annie
floated
down
to
him
from
the
moon
above
the
hill
his
head
sank
upon
her
breast
again
but
alas
it
was
aflame
and
he
looked
down
and
he
saw
that
his
own
flesh
was
aflame
and
he
knew
that
the
fire
could
never
be
quenched
there
was
a
heavy
weight
upon
his
head
his
feet
were
nailed
to
the
floor
and
his
arms
bound
tight
beside
him
he
seemed
to
himself
to
rage
and
struggle
with
the
strength
of
a
madman
but
his
hand
only
stirred
and
quivered
a
little
as
it
lay
upon
the
desk
again
he
was
astray
in
the
mist
wandering
through
the
waste
avenues
of
a
city
that
had
been
ruined
from
ages
it
had
been
splendid
as
rome
terrible
as
babylon
and
for
ever
the
darkness
had
covered
it
and
it
lay
desolate
for
ever
in
the
accursed
plain
and
far
and
far
the
grey
passages
stretched
into
the
night
into
the
icy
fields
into
the
place
of
eternal
gloom
ring
within
ring
the
awful
temple
closed
around
him
unending
circles
of
vast
stones
circle
within
circle
and
every
circle
less
throughout
all
ages
in
the
center
was
the
sanctuary
of
the
infernal
rite
and
he
was
borne
thither
as
in
the
eddies
of
a
whirlpool
to
consummate
his
ruin
to
celebrate
the
wedding
of
the
sabbath
he
flung
up
his
arms
and
beat
the
air
resisting
with
all
his
strength
with
muscles
that
could
throw
down
mountains
and
this
time
his
little
finger
stirred
for
an
instant
and
his
foot
twitched
upon
the
floor
then
suddenly
a
flaring
street
shone
before
him
there
was
darkness
round
about
him
but
it
flamed
with
hissing
jets
of
light
and
naphtha
fires
and
great
glittering
lamps
swayed
very
slowly
in
a
violent
blast
of
air
a
horrible
music
and
the
exultation
of
discordant
voices
swelled
in
his
ears
and
he
saw
an
uncertain
tossing
crowd
of
dusky
figures
that
circled
and
leapt
before
him
there
was
a
noise
like
the
chant
of
the
lost
and
then
there
appeared
in
the
midst
of
the
orgy
beneath
a
red
flame
the
figure
of
a
woman
her
bronze
hair
and
flushed
cheeks
were
illuminate
and
an
argent
light
shone
from
her
eyes
and
with
a
smile
that
froze
his
heart
her
lips
opened
to
speak
to
him
the
tossing
crowd
faded
away
falling
into
a
gulf
of
darkness
and
then
she
drew
out
from
her
hair
pins
of
curious
gold
and
glowing
brooches
in
enamel
and
poured
out
jewels
before
him
from
a
silver
box
and
then
she
stripped
from
her
body
her
precious
robes
and
stood
in
the
glowing
mist
of
her
hair
and
held
out
her
arms
to
him
but
he
raised
his
eyes
and
saw
the
mould
and
decay
gaining
on
the
walls
of
a
dismal
room
and
a
gloomy
paper
was
dropping
to
the
rotting
floor
a
vapor
of
the
grave
entered
his
nostrils
and
he
cried
out
with
a
loud
scream
but
there
was
only
an
indistinct
guttural
murmur
in
his
throat
and
presently
the
woman
fled
away
from
him
and
he
pursued
her
she
fled
away
before
him
through
midnight
country
and
he
followed
after
her
chasing
her
from
thicket
to
thicket
from
valley
to
valley
and
at
last
he
captured
her
and
won
her
with
horrible
caresses
and
they
went
up
to
celebrate
and
make
the
marriage
of
the
sabbath
they
were
within
the
matted
thicket
and
they
writhed
in
the
flames
insatiable
for
ever
they
were
tortured
and
tortured
one
another
in
the
sight
of
thousands
who
gathered
thick
about
them
and
their
desire
rose
up
like
a
black
smoke
without
the
storm
swelled
to
the
roaring
of
an
awful
sea
the
wind
grew
to
a
shrill
long
scream
the
was
riven
and
split
with
the
crash
of
a
thunderclap
to
lucian
the
tumult
and
the
shock
came
as
a
gentle
murmur
as
if
a
brake
stirred
before
a
sudden
breeze
in
summer
and
then
a
vast
silence
overwhelmed
him
a
few
minutes
later
there
was
a
shuffling
of
feet
in
the
passage
and
the
door
was
softly
opened
a
woman
came
in
holding
a
light
and
she
peered
curiously
at
the
figure
sitting
quite
still
in
the
chair
before
the
desk
the
woman
was
half
dressed
and
she
had
let
her
splendid
bronze
hair
flow
down
her
cheeks
were
flushed
and
as
she
advanced
into
the
shabby
room
the
lamp
she
carried
cast
quaking
shadows
on
the
moldering
paper
patched
with
marks
of
rising
damp
and
hanging
in
strips
from
the
wet
dripping
wall
the
blind
had
not
been
drawn
but
no
light
or
glimmer
of
light
filtered
through
the
window
for
a
great
straggling
box
tree
that
beat
the
rain
upon
the
panes
shut
out
even
the
night
the
woman
came
softly
and
as
she
bent
down
over
lucian
an
argent
gleam
shone
from
her
brown
eyes
and
the
little
curls
upon
her
neck
were
like
golden
work
upon
marble
she
put
her
hand
to
his
heart
and
looked
up
and
beckoned
to
some
one
who
was
waiting
by
the
door
come
in
joe
she
said
it
just
as
i
thought
it
would
be
by
misadventure
and
she
held
up
a
little
empty
bottle
of
dark
blue
glass
that
was
standing
on
the
desk
he
would
take
it
and
i
always
knew
he
would
take
a
drop
too
much
one
of
these
days
what
all
those
papers
that
he
got
there
did
i
tell
you
it
was
crool
to
see
him
he
got
it
into
he
could
write
a
book
he
been
at
it
for
the
last
six
months
look
she
spread
the
neat
pile
of
manuscript
broadcast
over
the
desk
and
took
a
sheet
at
haphazard
it
was
all
covered
with
illegible
hopeless
scribblings
only
here
and
there
it
was
possible
to
recognize
a
word
why
nobody
could
read
it
if
they
wanted
to
it
all
like
that
he
thought
it
was
beautiful
i
used
to
him
jabbering
to
himself
about
it
dreadful
nonsense
it
was
he
used
to
talk
i
did
my
best
to
tongue
him
out
of
it
but
it
was
any
good
he
must
have
been
a
bit
dotty
he
left
you
everything
yes
you
have
to
see
about
the
funeral
there
be
the
inquest
and
all
that
first
you
got
evidence
to
show
he
took
the
stuff
yes
to
be
sure
i
have
the
doctor
told
him
he
would
be
certain
to
do
for
himself
and
he
was
found
two
or
three
times
quite
silly
in
the
streets
they
had
to
drag
him
away
from
a
house
in
halden
road
he
was
carrying
on
dreadful
shaking
at
the
gaite
and
calling
out
it
was
and
they
would
let
him
in
i
heard
manning
myself
tell
in
this
very
room
that
he
kill
one
of
these
days
joe
are
you
ashamed
of
yourself
i
declare
you
quite
rude
and
it
almost
sunday
too
bring
the
light
over
here
ca
you
the
man
took
up
the
blazing
paraffin
lamp
and
set
it
on
the
desk
beside
the
scattered
heap
of
that
terrible
manuscript
the
flaring
light
shone
through
the
dead
eyes
into
the
dying
brain
and
there
was
a
glow
within
as
if
great
furnace

were
