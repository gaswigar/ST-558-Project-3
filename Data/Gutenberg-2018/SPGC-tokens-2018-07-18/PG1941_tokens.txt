dedication

george
sand
your
name
dear
george
while
casting
a
reflected
radiance
on
my
book
can
gain
no
new
glory
from
this
page
and
yet
it
is
neither
nor
diffidence
which
has
led
me
to
place
it
there
but
only
the
wish
that
it
should
bear
witness
to
the
solid
friendship
between
us
which
has
survived
our
wanderings
and
separations
and
triumphed
over
the
busy
malice
of
the
world
this
feeling
is
hardly
likely
now
to
change
the
goodly
company
of
friendly
names
which
will
remain
attached
to
my
works
forms
an
element
of
pleasure
in
the
midst
of
the
vexation
caused
by
their
increasing
number
each
fresh
book
in
fact
gives
rise
to
fresh
annoyance
were
it
only
in
the
reproaches
aimed
at
my
too
prolific
pen
as
though
it
could
rival
in
fertility
the
world
from
which
i
draw
my
models
would
it
not
be
a
fine
thing
george
if
the
future
antiquarian
of
dead
literatures
were
to
find
in
this
company
none
but
great
names
and
generous
hearts
friends
bound
by
pure
and
holy
ties
the
illustrious
figures
of
the
century
may
i
not
justly
pride
myself
on
this
assured
possession
rather
than
on
a
popularity
necessarily
unstable
for
him
who
knows
you
well
it
is
happiness
to
be
able
to
sign
himself
as
i
do

june
letters
of
two
brides
first
part
louise
de
chaulieu
to
renee
de
maucombe
paris
september
sweetheart
i
too
am
free
and
i
am
the
first
too
unless
you
have
written
to
blois
at
our
sweet
tryst
of
raise
those
great
black
eyes
of
yours
fixed
on
my
opening
sentence
and
keep
this
excitement
for
the
letter
which
shall
tell
you
of
my
first
love
by
the
way
why
always
first
is
there
i
wonder
a
second
love
do
go
running
on
like
this
you
will
say
but
tell
me
rather
how
you
made
your
escape
from
the
convent
where
you
were
to
take
your
vows
well
dear
i
do
know
about
the
carmelites
but
the
miracle
of
my
own
deliverance
was
i
can
assure
you
most
humdrum
the
cries
of
an
alarmed
conscience
triumphed
over
the
dictates
of
a
stern
policy
there
the
whole
mystery
the
sombre
melancholy
which
seized
me
after
you
left
hastened
the
happy
climax
my
aunt
did
not
want
to
see
me
die
of
a
decline
and
my
mother
whose
one
unfailing
cure
for
my
malady
was
a
novitiate
gave
way
before
her
so
i
am
in
paris
thanks
to
you
my
love
dear
renee
could
you
have
seen
me
the
day
i
found
myself
parted
from
you
well
might
you
have
gloried
in
the
deep
impression
you
had
made
on
so
youthful
a
bosom
we
had
lived
so
constantly
together
sharing
our
dreams
and
letting
our
fancy
roam
together
that
i
verily
believe
our
souls
had
become
welded
together
like
those
two
hungarian
girls
whose
death
we
heard
about
from
beauvisage
poor
misnamed
being
never
surely
was
man
better
cut
out
by
nature
for
the
post
of
convent
physician
tell
me
did
you
not
droop
and
sicken
with
your
darling
in
my
gloomy
depression
i
could
do
nothing
but
count
over
the
ties
which
bind
us
but
it
seemed
as
though
distance
had
loosened
them
i
wearied
of
life
like
a
widowed
of
her
mate
death
smiled
sweetly
on
me
and
i
was
proceeding
quietly
to
die
to
be
at
blois
at
the
carmelites
consumed
by
dread
of
having
to
take
my
vows
there
a
mlle
de
la
valliere
but
without
her
prelude
and
without
my
renee
how
could
i
not
be
sick
sick
unto
death
how
different
it
used
to
be
that
monotonous
existence
where
every
hour
brings
its
duty
its
prayer
its
task
with
such
desperate
regularity
that
you
can
tell
what
a
carmelite
sister
is
doing
in
any
place
at
any
hour
of
the
night
or
day
that
deadly
dull
routine
which
crushes
out
all
interest
in
one
surroundings
had
become
for
us
two
a
world
of
life
and
movement
imagination
had
thrown
open
her
fairy
realms
and
in
these
our
spirits
ranged
at
will
each
in
turn
serving
as
magic
steed
to
the
other
the
more
alert
quickening
the
drowsy
the
world
from
which
our
bodies
were
shut
out
became
the
playground
of
our
fancy
which
reveled
there
in
frolicsome
adventure
the
very
of
the
helped
us
to
understand
what
was
so
carefully
left
unsaid
but
the
day
when
i
was
reft
of
your
sweet
company
i
became
a
true
carmelite
such
as
they
appeared
to
us
a
modern
danaid
who
instead
of
trying
to
fill
a
bottomless
barrel
draws
every
day
from
heaven
knows
what
deep
an
empty
pitcher
thinking
to
find
it
full
my
aunt
knew
nothing
of
this
inner
life
how
could
she
who
has
made
a
paradise
for
herself
within
the
two
acres
of
her
convent
understand
my
revolt
against
life
a
religious
life
if
embraced
by
girls
of
our
age
demands
either
an
extreme
simplicity
of
soul
such
as
we
sweetheart
do
not
possess
or
else
an
ardor
for
like
that
which
makes
my
aunt
so
noble
a
character
but
she
sacrificed
herself
for
a
brother
to
whom
she
was
devoted
to
do
the
same
for
an
unknown
person
or
an
idea
is
surely
more
than
can
be
asked
of
mortals
for
the
last
fortnight
i
have
been
gulping
down
so
many
reckless
words
burying
so
many
reflections
in
my
bosom
and
accumulating
such
a
store
of
things
to
tell
fit
for
your
ear
alone
that
i
should
certainly
have
been
suffocated
but
for
the
resource
of
as
a
sorry
substitute
for
our
beloved
talks
how
hungry
one
heart
gets
i
am
beginning
my
journal
this
morning
and
i
picture
to
myself
that
yours
is
already
started
and
that
in
a
few
days
i
shall
be
at
home
in
your
beautiful
gemenos
valley
which
i
know
only
through
your
descriptions
just
as
you
will
live
that
paris
life
revealed
to
you
hitherto
only
in
our
dreams
well
then
sweet
child
know
that
on
a
certain
morning
a
day
in
my
life
there
arrived
from
paris
a
lady
companion
and
philippe
the
last
remaining
of
my
grandmother
valets
charged
to
carry
me
off
when
my
aunt
summoned
me
to
her
room
and
told
me
the
news
i
could
not
speak
for
joy
and
only
gazed
at
her
stupidly
my
child
she
said
in
her
guttural
voice
i
can
see
that
you
leave
me
without
regret
but
this
farewell
is
not
the
last
we
shall
meet
again
god
has
placed
on
your
forehead
the
sign
of
the
elect
you
have
the
pride
which
leads
to
heaven
or
to
hell
but
your
nature
is
too
noble
to
choose
the
downward
path
i
know
you
better
than
you
know
yourself
with
you
passion
i
can
see
will
be
very
different
from
what
it
is
with
most
women
she
drew
me
gently
to
her
and
kissed
my
forehead
the
kiss
made
my
flesh
creep
for
it
burned
with
that
consuming
fire
which
eats
away
her
life
which
has
turned
to
black
the
azure
of
her
eyes
and
softened
the
lines
about
them
has
furrowed
the
warm
ivory
of
her
temples
and
cast
a
sallow
tinge
over
the
beautiful
face
before
replying
i
kissed
her
hands
dear
aunt
i
said
i
shall
never
forget
your
kindness
and
if
it
has
not
made
your
nunnery
all
that
it
ought
to
be
for
my
health
of
body
and
soul
you
may
be
sure
nothing
short
of
a
broken
heart
will
bring
me
back
again
and
that
you
would
not
wish
for
me
you
will
not
see
me
here
again
till
my
royal
lover
has
deserted
me
and
i
warn
you
that
if
i
catch
him
death
alone
shall
tear
him
from
me
i
fear
no
montespan
she
smiled
and
said
go
madcap
and
take
your
idle
fancies
with
you
there
is
certainly
more
of
the
bold
montespan
in
you
than
of
the
gentle
la
valliere
i
threw
my
arms
round
her
the
poor
lady
could
not
refrain
from
escorting
me
to
the
carriage
there
her
tender
gaze
was
divided
between
me
and
the
armorial
bearings
at
beaugency
night
overtook
me
still
sunk
in
a
stupor
of
the
mind
produced
by
these
strange
parting
words
what
can
be
awaiting
me
in
this
world
for
which
i
have
so
hungered
to
begin
with
i
found
no
one
to
receive
me
my
heart
had
been
schooled
in
vain
my
mother
was
at
the
bois
de
boulogne
my
father
at
the
council
my
brother
the
duc
de
rhetore
never
comes
in
i
am
told
till
it
is
time
to
dress
for
dinner
miss
griffith
she
is
not
unlike
a
griffin
and
philippe
took
me
to
my
rooms
the
suite
is
the
one
which
belonged
to
my
beloved
grandmother
the
princess
de
vauremont
to
whom
i
owe
some
sort
of
a
fortune
which
no
one
has
ever
told
me
about
as
you
read
this
you
will
understand
the
sadness
which
came
over
me
as
i
entered
a
place
sacred
to
so
many
memories
and
found
the
rooms
just
as
she
had
left
them
i
was
to
sleep
in
the
bed
where
she
died
sitting
down
on
the
edge
of
the
sofa
i
burst
into
tears
forgetting
i
was
not
alone
and
remembering
only
how
often
i
had
stood
there
by
her
knees
the
better
to
hear
her
words
there
i
had
gazed
upon
her
face
buried
in
its
brown
laces
and
worn
as
much
by
age
as
by
the
pangs
of
approaching
death
the
room
seemed
to
me
still
warm
with
the
heat
which
she
kept
up
there
how
comes
it
that
de
chaulieu
must
be
like
some
peasant
girl
who
sleeps
in
her
mother
bed
the
very
morrow
of
her
death
for
to
me
it
was
as
though
the
princess
who
died
in
had
passed
away
but
yesterday
i
saw
many
things
in
the
room
which
ought
to
have
been
removed
their
presence
showed
the
carelessness
with
which
people
busy
with
the
affairs
of
state
may
treat
their
own
and
also
the
little
thought
which
had
been
given
since
her
death
to
this
grand
old
lady
who
will
always
remain
one
of
the
striking
figures
of
the
eighteenth
century
philippe
seemed
to
divine
something
of
the
cause
of
my
tears
he
told
me
that
the
furniture
of
the
princess
had
been
left
to
me
in
her
will
and
that
my
father
had
allowed
all
the
larger
suites
to
remain
dismantled
as
the
revolution
had
left
them
on
hearing
this
i
rose
and
philippe
opened
the
door
of
the
small
which
leads
into
the
in
these
i
found
all
the
wreckage
the
panels
above
the
doors
which
had
contained
valuable
pictures
bare
of
all
but
empty
frames
broken
marbles
mirrors
carried
off
in
old
days
i
was
afraid
to
go
up
the
state
staircase
and
cross
these
vast
deserted
rooms
so
i
used
to
get
to
the
princess
rooms
by
a
small
staircase
which
runs
under
the
arch
of
the
larger
one
and
leads
to
the
secret
door
of
her
my
suite
consisting
of
a
bedroom
and
the
pretty
in
scarlet
and
gold
of
which
i
have
told
you
lies
in
the
wing
on
the
side
of
the
invalides
the
house
is
only
separated
from
the
boulevard
by
a
wall
covered
with
creepers
and
by
a
splendid
avenue
of
trees
which
mingle
their
foliage
with
that
of
the
young
elms
on
the
sidewalk
of
the
boulevard
but
for
the
dome
of
the
invalides
and
its
gray
stone
mass
you
might
be
in
a
wood
the
style
of
decoration
in
these
rooms
together
with
their
situation
indicates
that
they
were
the
old
show
suite
of
the
duchesses
while
the
dukes
must
have
had
theirs
in
the
wing
opposite
the
two
suites
are
decorously
separated
by
the
two
main
blocks
as
well
as
by
the
central
one
which
contained
those
vast
gloomy
resounding
halls
shown
me
by
philippe
all
despoiled
of
their
splendor
as
in
the
days
of
my
childhood
philippe
grew
quite
confidential
when
he
saw
the
surprise
depicted
on
my
countenance
for
you
must
know
that
in
this
home
of
diplomacy
the
very
servants
have
a
reserved
and
mysterious
air
he
went
on
to
tell
me
that
it
was
expected
a
law
would
soon
be
passed
restoring
to
the
fugitives
of
the
revolution
the
value
of
their
property
and
that
my
father
is
waiting
to
do
up
his
house
till
this
restitution
is
made
the
architect
having
estimated
the
damage
at
three
hundred
thousand
livres
this
piece
of
news
flung
me
back
despairing
on
my
sofa
could
it
be
that
my
father
instead
of
spending
this
money
in
arranging
a
marriage
for
me
would
have
left
me
to
die
in
the
convent
this
was
the
first
thought
to
greet
me
on
the
threshold
of
my
home
ah
renee
what
would
i
have
given
then
to
rest
my
head
upon
your
shoulder
or
to
transport
myself
to
the
days
when
my
grandmother
made
the
life
of
these
rooms
you
two
in
all
the
world
have
been
alone
in
loving
me
you
away
at
maucombe
and
she
who
survives
only
in
my
heart
the
dear
old
lady
whose
still
youthful
eyes
used
to
open
from
sleep
at
my
call
how
well
we
understood
each
other
these
memories
suddenly
changed
my
mood
what
at
first
had
seemed
profanation
now
breathed
of
holy
association
it
was
sweet
to
inhale
the
faint
odor
of
the
powder
she
loved
still
lingering
in
the
room
sweet
to
sleep
beneath
the
shelter
of
those
yellow
damask
curtains
with
their
white
pattern
which
must
have
retained
something
of
the
spirit
emanating
from
her
eyes
and
breath
i
told
philippe
to
rub
up
the
old
furniture
and
make
the
rooms
look
as
if
they
were
lived
in
i
explained
to
him
myself
how
i
wanted
everything
arranged
and
where
to
put
each
piece
of
furniture
in
this
way
i
entered
into
possession
and
showed
how
an
air
of
youth
might
be
given
to
the
dear
old
things
the
bedroom
is
white
in
color
a
little
dulled
with
time
just
as
the
gilding
of
the
fanciful
arabesques
shows
here
and
there
a
patch
of
red
but
this
effect
harmonizes
well
with
the
faded
colors
of
the
savonnerie
tapestry
which
was
presented
to
my
grandmother
by
louis
xv
along
with
his
portrait
the
timepiece
was
a
gift
from
the
marechal
de
saxe
and
the
china
ornaments
on
the
mantelpiece
came
from
the
marechal
de
richelieu
my
grandmother
portrait
painted
at
the
age
of
hangs
in
an
oval
frame
opposite
that
of
the
king
the
prince
her
husband
is
conspicuous
by
his
absence
i
like
this
frank
negligence
untinged
by
hypocrisy
a
characteristic
touch
which
sums
up
her
charming
personality
once
when
my
grandmother
was
seriously
ill
her
confessor
was
urgent
that
the
prince
who
was
waiting
in
the
should
be
admitted
he
can
come
in
with
the
doctor
and
his
drugs
was
the
reply
the
bed
has
a
canopy
and
back
and
the
curtains
are
looped
up
with
fine
wide
bands
the
furniture
is
of
gilded
wood
upholstered
in
the
same
yellow
damask
with
white
flowers
which
drapes
the
windows
and
which
is
lined
there
with
a
white
silk
that
looks
as
though
it
were
watered
the
panels
over
the
doors
have
been
painted
by
what
artist
i
ca
say
but
they
represent
one
a
sunrise
the
other
a
moonlight
scene
the
fireplace
is
a
very
interesting
feature
in
the
room
it
is
easy
to
see
that
life
in
the
last
century
centered
largely
round
the
hearth
where
great
events
were
enacted
the
copper
gilt
grate
is
a
marvel
of
workmanship
and
the
mantelpiece
is
most
delicately
finished
the
are
beautifully
chased
the
bellows
are
a
perfect
gem
the
tapestry
of
the
screen
comes
from
the
gobelins
and
is
exquisitely
mounted
charming
fantastic
figures
run
all
over
the
frame
on
the
feet
the
supporting
bar
and
the
wings
the
whole
thing
is
wrought
like
a
fan
dearly
should
i
like
to
know
who
was
the
giver
of
this
dainty
work
of
art
which
was
such
a
favorite
with
her
how
often
have
i
seen
the
old
lady
her
feet
upon
the
bar
reclining
in
the
with
her
dress
half
raised
in
front
toying
with
the
which
lay
upon
the
ledge
between
her
box
of
pastilles
and
her
silk
mits
what
a
coquette
she
was
to
the
day
of
her
death
she
took
as
much
pains
with
her
appearance
as
though
the
beautiful
portrait
had
been
painted
only
yesterday
and
she
were
waiting
to
receive
the
throng
of
exquisites
from
the
court
how
the
armchair
recalls
to
me
the
inimitable
sweep
of
her
skirts
as
she
sank
back
in
it
these
women
of
a
past
generation
have
carried
off
with
them
secrets
which
are
very
typical
of
their
age
the
princess
had
a
certain
turn
of
the
head
a
way
of
dropping
her
glance
and
her
remarks
a
choice
of
words
which
i
look
for
in
vain
even
in
my
mother
there
was
subtlety
in
it
all
and
there
was
the
points
were
made
without
any
affectation
her
talk
was
at
once
lengthy
and
concise
she
told
a
good
story
and
could
put
her
meaning
in
three
words
above
all
she
was
extremely
and
this
has
undoubtedly
had
its
effect
on
my
way
of
looking
at
things
from
seven
years
old
till
i
was
ten
i
never
left
her
side
it
pleased
her
to
attract
me
as
much
as
it
pleased
me
to
go
this
preference
was
the
cause
of
more
than
one
passage
at
arms
between
her
and
my
mother
and
nothing
intensifies
feeling
like
the
icy
breath
of
persecution
how
charming
was
her
greeting
here
you
are
little
rogue
when
curiosity
had
taught
me
how
to
glide
with
stealthy
movements
to
her
room
she
felt
that
i
loved
her
and
this
childish
affection
was
welcome
as
a
ray
of
sunshine
in
the
winter
of
her
life
i
do
know
what
went
on
in
her
rooms
at
night
but
she
had
many
visitors
and
when
i
came
on
tiptoe
in
the
morning
to
see
if
she
were
awake
i
would
find
the
furniture
disarranged
the
set
out
and
patches
of
snuff
scattered
about
this
is
furnished
in
the
same
style
as
the
bedroom
the
chairs
and
tables
are
oddly
shaped
with
claw
feet
and
hollow
mouldings
rich
garlands
of
flowers
beautifully
designed
and
carved
wind
over
the
mirrors
and
hang
down
in
festoons
on
the
consoles
are
fine
china
vases
the
ground
colors
are
scarlet
and
white
my
grandmother
was
a
striking
brunette
as
might
be
inferred
from
her
choice
of
colors
i
have
found
in
the
a
i
remember
well
the
figures
on
it
used
to
fascinate
me
it
is
plaited
in
graven
silver
and
was
a
present
from
one
of
the
genoese
lomellini
each
side
of
the
table
represents
the
occupations
of
a
different
season
there
are
hundreds
of
figures
in
each
picture
and
all
in
relief
i
remained
alone
for
two
hours
while
old
memories
rose
before
me
one
after
another
on
this
spot
hallowed
by
the
death
of
a
woman
most
remarkable
even
among
the
witty
and
beautiful
court
ladies
of
louis
xv
day
you
know
how
abruptly
i
was
parted
from
her
at
a
day
notice
in
go
and
bid
to
your
grandmother
said
my
mother
the
princess
received
me
as
usual
without
any
display
of
feeling
and
expressed
no
surprise
at
my
departure
you
are
going
to
the
convent
dear
she
said
and
will
see
your
aunt
there
who
is
an
excellent
woman
i
shall
take
care
though
that
they
do
make
a
victim
of
you
you
shall
be
independent
and
able
to
marry
whom
you
please
six
months
later
she
died
her
will
had
been
given
into
the
keeping
of
the
prince
de
talleyrand
the
most
devoted
of
all
her
old
friends
he
contrived
while
paying
a
visit
to
mlle
de
chargeboeuf
to
intimate
to
me
through
her
that
my
grandmother
forbade
me
to
take
the
vows
i
hope
sooner
or
later
to
meet
the
prince
and
then
i
shall
doubtless
learn
more
from
him
thus
sweetheart
if
i
have
found
no
one
in
flesh
and
blood
to
meet
me
i
have
comforted
myself
with
the
shade
of
the
dear
princess
and
have
prepared
myself
for
carrying
out
one
of
our
pledges
which
was
as
you
know
to
keep
each
other
informed
of
the
smallest
details
in
our
homes
and
occupations
it
makes
such
a
difference
to
know
where
and
how
the
life
of
one
we
love
is
passed
send
me
a
faithful
picture
of
the
veriest
trifles
around
you
omitting
nothing
not
even
the
sunset
lights
among
the
tall
trees
october
it
was
three
in
the
afternoon
when
i
arrived
about
five
rose
came
and
told
me
that
my
mother
had
returned
so
i
went
downstairs
to
pay
my
respects
to
her
my
mother
lives
in
a
suite
on
the
ground
floor
exactly
corresponding
to
mine
and
in
the
same
block
i
am
just
over
her
head
and
the
same
secret
staircase
serves
for
both
my
father
rooms
are
in
the
block
opposite
but
are
larger
by
the
whole
of
the
space
occupied
by
the
grand
staircase
on
our
side
of
the
building
these
ancestral
mansions
are
so
spacious
that
my
father
and
mother
continue
to
occupy
the
rooms
in
spite
of
the
social
duties
which
have
once
more
devolved
on
them
with
the
return
of
the
bourbons
and
are
even
able
to
receive
in
them
i
found
my
mother
dressed
for
the
evening
in
her
where
nothing
is
changed
i
came
slowly
down
the
stairs
speculating
with
every
step
how
i
should
be
met
by
this
mother
who
had
shown
herself
so
little
of
a
mother
to
me
and
from
whom
during
eight
years
i
had
heard
nothing
beyond
the
two
letters
of
which
you
know
judging
it
unworthy
to
simulate
an
affection
i
could
not
possibly
feel
i
put
on
the
air
of
a
pious
imbecile
and
entered
the
room
with
many
inward
qualms
which
however
soon
disappeared
my
mother
tack
was
equal
to
the
occasion
she
made
no
pretence
of
emotion
she
neither
held
me
at
nor
hugged
me
to
her
bosom
like
a
beloved
daughter
but
greeted
me
as
though
we
had
parted
the
evening
before
her
manner
was
that
of
the
kindliest
and
most
sincere
friend
as
she
addressed
me
like
a
grown
person
first
kissing
me
on
the
forehead
my
dear
little
one
she
said
if
you
were
to
die
at
the
convent
it
is
much
better
to
live
with
your
family
you
frustrate
your
plans
and
mine
but
the
age
of
blind
obedience
to
parents
is
past
de
chaulieu
intention
and
in
this
i
am
quite
at
one
with
him
is
to
lose
no
opportunity
of
making
your
life
pleasant
and
of
letting
you
see
the
world
at
your
age
i
should
have
thought
as
you
do
therefore
i
am
not
vexed
with
you
it
is
impossible
you
should
understand
what
we
expected
from
you
you
will
not
find
any
absurd
severity
in
me
and
if
you
have
ever
thought
me
heartless
you
will
soon
find
out
your
mistake
still
though
i
wish
you
to
feel
perfectly
free
i
think
that
to
begin
with
you
would
do
well
to
follow
the
counsels
of
a
mother
who
wishes
to
be
a
sister
to
you
i
was
quite
charmed
by
the
duchess
who
talked
in
a
gentle
voice
straightening
my
convent
tippet
as
she
spoke
at
the
age
of
she
is
still
exquisitely
beautiful
she
has
eyes
with
silken
lashes
a
smooth
forehead
and
a
complexion
so
pink
and
white
that
you
might
think
she
paints
her
bust
and
shoulders
are
marvelous
and
her
waist
is
as
slender
as
yours
her
hand
is
and
extraordinarily
beautiful
the
nails
catch
the
light
in
their
perfect
polish
the
thumb
is
like
ivory
the
little
finger
stands
just
a
little
apart
from
the
rest
and
the
foot
matches
the
hand
it
is
the
spanish
foot
of
mlle
de
vandenesse
if
she
is
like
this
at
forty
at
sixty
she
will
still
be
a
beautiful
woman
i
replied
sweetheart
like
a
good
little
girl
i
was
as
nice
to
her
as
she
to
me
nay
nicer
her
beauty
completely
vanquished
me
it
seemed
only
natural
that
such
a
woman
should
be
absorbed
in
her
regal
part
i
told
her
this
as
simply
as
though
i
had
been
talking
to
you
i
daresay
it
was
a
surprise
to
her
to
hear
words
of
affection
from
her
mouth
and
the
unfeigned
homage
of
my
admiration
evidently
touched
her
deeply
her
manner
changed
and
became
even
more
engaging
she
dropped
all
formality
as
she
said
i
am
much
pleased
with
you
and
i
hope
we
shall
remain
good
friends
the
words
struck
me
as
charmingly
naive
but
i
did
not
let
this
appear
for
i
saw
at
once
that
the
prudent
course
was
to
allow
her
to
believe
herself
much
deeper
and
cleverer
than
her
daughter
so
i
only
stared
vacantly
and
she
was
delighted
i
kissed
her
hands
repeatedly
telling
her
how
happy
it
made
me
to
be
so
treated
and
to
feel
at
my
ease
with
her
i
even
confided
to
her
my
previous
tremors
she
smiled
put
her
arm
round
my
neck
and
drawing
me
towards
her
kissed
me
on
the
forehead
most
affectionately
dear
child
she
said
we
have
people
coming
to
dinner
perhaps
you
will
agree
with
me
that
it
is
better
for
you
not
to
make
your
first
appearance
in
society
till
you
have
been
in
the
dressmaker
hands
so
after
you
have
seen
your
father
and
brother
you
can
go
upstairs
again
i
assented
most
heartily
my
mother
exquisite
dress
was
the
first
revelation
to
me
of
the
world
which
our
dreams
had
pictured
but
i
did
not
feel
the
slightest
desire
to
rival
her
my
father
now
entered
and
the
duchess
presented
me
to
him
he
became
all
at
once
most
affectionate
and
played
the
father
part
so
well
that
i
could
not
but
believe
his
heart
to
be
in
it
taking
my
two
hands
in
his
and
kissing
them
with
more
of
the
lover
than
the
father
in
his
manner
he
said
so
this
is
my
rebel
daughter
and
he
drew
me
towards
him
with
his
arm
passed
tenderly
round
my
waist
while
he
kissed
me
on
the
cheeks
and
forehead
the
pleasure
with
which
we
shall
watch
your
success
in
society
will
atone
for
the
disappointment
we
felt
at
your
change
of
vocation
he
said
then
turning
to
my
mother
do
you
know
that
she
is
going
to
turn
out
very
pretty
and
you
will
be
proud
of
her
some
day
here
is
your
brother
alphonse
he
said
to
a
fine
young
man
who
came
in
here
is
your
sister
who
threatens
to
send
her
nun
frock
to
the
deuce
my
brother
came
up
in
a
leisurely
way
and
took
my
hand
which
he
pressed
come
come
you
may
kiss
her
said
my
father
and
he
kissed
me
on
both
cheeks
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
he
said
and
i
take
your
side
against
my
father
i
thanked
him
but
could
not
help
thinking
he
might
have
come
to
blois
when
he
was
at
orleans
visiting
our
marquis
brother
in
his
quarters
fearing
the
arrival
of
strangers
i
now
withdrew
i
tidied
up
my
rooms
and
laid
out
on
the
scarlet
velvet
of
my
lovely
table
all
the
materials
necessary
for
writing
to
you
meditating
all
the
while
on
my
new
situation
this
my
fair
sweetheart
is
a
true
and
veracious
account
of
the
return
of
a
girl
of
eighteen
after
an
absence
of
nine
years
to
the
bosom
of
one
of
the
noblest
families
in
the
kingdom
i
was
tired
by
the
journey
as
well
as
by
all
the
emotions
i
had
been
through
so
i
went
to
bed
in
convent
fashion
at
eight
after
supper
they
have
preserved
even
a
little
saxe
service
which
the
dear
princess
used
when
she
had
a
fancy
for
taking
her
meals
alone
ii
the
same
to
the
same
november
next
day
i
found
my
rooms
done
out
and
dusted
and
even
flowers
put
in
the
vases
by
old
philippe
i
began
to
feel
at
home
only
it
occur
to
anybody
that
a
carmelite
schoolgirl
has
an
early
appetite
and
rose
had
no
end
of
trouble
in
getting
breakfast
for
me
mlle
goes
to
bed
at
she
said
to
me
and
gets
up
when
the
duke
is
just
returning
home
i
began
to
write
about
one
my
father
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
small
and
asked
if
he
might
come
in
i
opened
the
door
he
came
in
and
found
me
writing
to
you
my
dear
he
began
you
will
have
to
get
yourself
clothes
and
to
make
these
rooms
comfortable
in
this
purse
you
will
find
twelve
thousand
francs
which
is
the
yearly
income
i
purpose
allowing
you
for
your
expenses
you
will
make
arrangements
with
your
mother
as
to
some
governess
whom
you
may
like
in
case
miss
griffith
does
please
you
for
mme
de
chaulieu
will
not
have
time
to
go
out
with
you
in
the
mornings
a
carriage
and
shall
be
at
your
disposal
let
me
keep
philippe
i
said
so
be
it
he
replied
but
do
be
uneasy
you
have
money
enough
of
your
own
to
be
no
burden
either
to
your
mother
or
me
may
i
ask
how
much
i
have
certainly
my
child
he
said
your
grandmother
left
you
five
hundred
thousand
francs
this
was
the
amount
of
her
savings
for
she
would
not
alienate
a
foot
of
land
from
the
family
this
sum
has
been
placed
in
government
stock
and
with
the
accumulated
interest
now
brings
in
about
forty
thousand
francs
a
year
with
this
i
had
purposed
making
an
independence
for
your
second
brother
and
it
is
here
that
you
have
upset
my
plans
later
however
it
is
possible
that
you
may
fall
in
with
them
it
shall
rest
with
yourself
for
i
have
confidence
in
your
good
sense
far
more
than
i
had
expected
i
do
not
need
to
tell
you
how
a
daughter
of
the
chaulieus
ought
to
behave
the
pride
so
plainly
written
in
your
features
is
my
best
guarantee
safeguards
such
as
common
folk
surround
their
daughters
with
would
be
an
insult
in
our
family
a
slander
reflecting
on
your
name
might
cost
the
life
of
the
man
bold
enough
to
utter
it
or
the
life
of
one
of
your
brothers
if
by
chance
the
right
should
not
prevail
no
more
on
this
subject
little
one
he
kissed
me
on
the
forehead
and
went
out
i
can
not
understand
the
relinquishment
of
this
plan
after
nine
years
persistence
in
it
my
father
frankness
is
what
i
like
there
is
no
ambiguity
about
his
words
my
money
ought
to
belong
to
his
marquis
son
who
then
has
had
bowels
of
mercy
my
mother
my
father
or
could
it
be
my
brother
i
remained
sitting
on
my
grandmother
sofa
staring
at
the
purse
which
my
father
had
left
on
the
mantelpiece
at
once
pleased
and
vexed
that
i
could
not
withdraw
my
mind
from
the
money
it
is
true
further
speculation
was
useless
my
doubts
had
been
cleared
up
and
there
was
something
fine
in
the
way
my
pride
was
spared
philippe
has
spent
the
morning
rushing
about
among
the
various
shops
and
workpeople
who
are
to
undertake
the
task
of
my
metamorphosis
a
famous
dressmaker
by
name
victorine
has
come
as
well
as
a
woman
for
underclothing
and
a
shoemaker
i
am
as
impatient
as
a
child
to
know
what
i
shall
be
like
when
i
emerge
from
the
sack
which
constituted
the
conventual
uniform
but
all
these
tradespeople
take
a
long
time
the
requires
a
whole
week
if
my
figure
is
not
to
be
spoilt
you
see
i
have
a
figure
dear
this
becomes
serious
janssen
the
operatic
shoemaker
solemnly
assures
me
that
i
have
my
mother
foot
the
whole
morning
has
gone
in
these
weighty
occupations
even
a
glovemaker
has
come
to
take
the
measure
of
my
hand
the
underclothing
woman
has
got
my
orders
at
the
meal
which
i
call
dinner
and
the
others
lunch
my
mother
told
me
that
we
were
going
together
to
the
milliner
to
see
some
hats
so
that
my
taste
should
be
formed
and
i
might
be
in
a
position
to
order
my
own
this
burst
of
independence
dazzles
me
i
am
like
a
blind
man
who
has
just
recovered
his
sight
now
i
begin
to
understand
the
vast
interval
which
separates
a
carmelite
sister
from
a
girl
in
society
of
ourselves
we
could
never
have
conceived
it
during
this
lunch
my
father
seemed
and
we
left
him
to
his
thoughts
he
is
deep
in
the
king
confidence
i
was
entirely
forgotten
but
from
what
i
have
seen
i
have
no
doubt
he
will
remember
me
when
he
has
need
of
me
he
is
a
very
attractive
man
in
spite
of
his
fifty
years
his
figure
is
youthful
he
is
well
made
fair
and
extremely
graceful
in
his
movements
he
has
a
diplomatic
face
at
once
dumb
and
expressive
his
nose
is
long
and
slender
and
he
has
brown
eyes
what
a
handsome
pair
strange
thoughts
assail
me
as
it
becomes
plain
to
me
that
these
two
so
perfectly
matched
in
birth
wealth
and
mental
superiority
live
entirely
apart
and
have
nothing
in
common
but
their
name
the
show
of
unity
is
only
for
the
world
the
cream
of
the
court
and
diplomatic
circles
were
here
last
night
very
soon
i
am
going
to
a
ball
given
by
the
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse
and
i
shall
be
presented
to
the
society
i
am
so
eager
to
know
a
is
coming
every
morning
to
give
me
lessons
for
i
must
be
able
to
dance
in
a
month
or
i
ca
go
to
the
ball
before
dinner
my
mother
came
to
talk
about
the
governess
with
me
i
have
decided
to
keep
miss
griffith
who
was
recommended
by
the
english
ambassador
miss
griffith
is
the
daughter
of
a
clergyman
her
mother
was
of
good
family
and
she
is
perfectly
well
bred
she
is
and
will
teach
me
english
the
good
soul
is
quite
handsome
enough
to
have
ambitions
she
is
scotch
poor
and
proud
and
will
act
as
my
chaperon
she
is
to
sleep
in
rose
room
rose
will
be
under
her
orders
i
saw
at
a
glance
that
my
governess
would
be
governed
by
me
in
the
six
days
we
have
been
together
she
has
made
very
sure
that
i
am
the
only
person
likely
to
take
an
interest
in
her
while
for
my
part
i
have
ascertained
that
for
all
her
statuesque
features
she
will
prove
accommodating
she
seems
to
me
a
kindly
soul
but
cautious
i
have
not
been
able
to
extract
a
word
of
what
passed
between
her
and
my
mother
another
trifling
piece
of
news
my
father
has
this
morning
refused
the
appointment
as
minister
of
state
which
was
offered
him
this
accounts
for
his
preoccupied
manner
last
night
he
says
he
would
prefer
an
embassy
to
the
worries
of
public
debate
spain
in
especial
attracts
him
this
news
was
told
me
at
lunch
the
one
moment
of
the
day
when
my
father
mother
and
brother
see
each
other
in
an
easy
way
the
servants
then
only
come
when
they
are
rung
for
the
rest
of
the
day
my
brother
as
well
as
my
father
spends
out
of
the
house
my
mother
has
her
toilet
to
make
between
two
and
four
she
is
never
visible
at
four
she
goes
out
for
an
hour
drive
when
she
is
not
dining
out
she
receives
from
six
to
seven
and
the
evening
is
given
to
entertainments
of
various
kinds
theatres
balls
concerts
at
homes
in
short
her
life
is
so
full
that
i
do
believe
she
ever
has
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
herself
she
must
spend
a
considerable
time
dressing
in
the
morning
for
at
lunch
which
takes
place
between
eleven
and
twelve
she
is
exquisite
the
meaning
of
the
things
that
are
said
about
her
is
dawning
on
me
she
begins
the
day
with
a
bath
barely
warmed
and
a
cup
of
cold
coffee
with
cream
then
she
dresses
she
is
never
except
on
some
great
emergency
called
before
nine
in
summer
there
are
morning
rides
and
at
two
she
receives
a
young
man
whom
i
have
never
yet
contrived
to
see
behold
our
family
life
we
meet
at
lunch
and
dinner
though
often
i
am
alone
with
my
mother
at
this
latter
meal
and
i
foresee
that
still
oftener
i
shall
take
it
in
my
own
rooms
following
the
example
of
my
grandmother
with
only
miss
griffith
for
company
for
my
mother
frequently
dines
out
i
have
ceased
to
wonder
at
the
indifference
my
family
have
shown
to
me
in
paris
my
dear
it
is
a
miracle
of
virtue
to
love
the
people
who
live
with
you
for
you
see
little
enough
of
them
as
for
the
absent
they
do
not
exist
knowing
as
this
may
sound
i
have
not
yet
set
foot
in
the
streets
and
am
deplorably
ignorant
i
must
wait
till
i
am
less
of
the
country
cousin
and
have
brought
my
dress
and
deportment
into
keeping
with
the
society
i
am
about
to
enter
the
whirl
of
which
amazes
me
even
here
where
only
distant
murmurs
reach
my
ear
so
far
i
have
not
gone
beyond
the
garden
but
the
italian
opera
opens
in
a
few
days
and
my
mother
has
a
box
there
i
am
crazy
with
delight
at
the
thought
of
hearing
italian
music
and
seeing
french
acting
already
i
begin
to
drop
convent
habits
for
those
of
society
i
spend
the
evening
writing
to
you
till
the
moment
for
going
to
bed
arrives
this
has
been
postponed
to
ten
the
hour
at
which
my
mother
goes
out
if
she
is
not
at
the
theatre
there
are
twelve
theatres
in
paris
i
am
grossly
ignorant
and
i
read
a
lot
but
quite
indiscriminately
one
book
leading
to
another
i
find
the
names
of
fresh
books
on
the
cover
of
the
one
i
am
reading
but
as
i
have
no
one
to
direct
me
i
light
on
some
which
are
fearfully
dull
what
modern
literature
i
have
read
all
turns
upon
love
the
subject
which
used
to
bulk
so
largely
in
our
thoughts
because
it
seemed
that
our
fate
was
determined
by
man
and
for
man
but
how
inferior
are
these
authors
to
two
little
girls
known
as
sweetheart
and
darling
otherwise
renee
and
louise
ah
my
love
what
wretched
plots
what
ridiculous
situations
and
what
poverty
of
sentiment
two
books
however
have
given
me
wonderful
pleasure
and
apropos
of
this
i
asked
my
father
one
day
whether
it
would
be
possible
for
me
to
see
mme
de
stael
my
father
mother
and
alphonse
all
burst
out
laughing
and
alphonse
said
where
in
the
world
has
she
sprung
from
to
which
my
father
replied
what
fools
we
are
she
springs
from
the
carmelites
my
child
mme
de
stael
is
dead
said
my
mother
gently
when
i
finished
i
asked
miss
griffith
how
a
woman
could
be
betrayed
why
of
course
when
she
loves
was
her
reply
renee
tell
me
do
you
think
we
could
be
betrayed
by
a
man
miss
griffith
has
at
last
discerned
that
i
am
not
an
utter
ignoramus
that
i
have
somewhere
a
hidden
vein
of
knowledge
the
knowledge
we
learned
from
each
other
in
our
random
arguments
she
sees
that
it
is
only
superficial
facts
of
which
i
am
ignorant
the
poor
thing
has
opened
her
heart
to
me
her
curt
reply
to
my
question
when
i
compare
it
with
all
the
sorrows
i
can
imagine
makes
me
feel
quite
creepy
once
more
she
urged
me
not
to
be
dazzled
by
the
glitter
of
society
to
be
always
on
my
guard
especially
against
what
most
attracted
me
this
is
the
of
her
wisdom
and
i
can
get
nothing
more
out
of
her
her
lectures
therefore
become
a
trifle
monotonous
and
she
might
be
compared
in
this
respect
to
the
bird
which
has
only
one
cry
iii
the
same
to
the
same
december
my
darling
here
i
am
ready
to
make
my
bow
to
the
world
by
way
of
preparation
i
have
been
trying
to
commit
all
the
follies
i
could
think
of
before
sobering
down
for
my
entry
this
morning
i
have
seen
myself
after
many
rehearsals
well
and
duly
equipped
stays
shoes
curls
dress
ornaments
all
in
order
following
the
example
of
duelists
before
a
meeting
i
tried
my
arms
in
the
privacy
of
my
chamber
i
wanted
to
see
how
i
would
look
and
had
no
difficulty
in
discovering
a
certain
air
of
victory
and
triumph
bound
to
carry
all
before
it
i
mustered
all
my
forces
in
accordance
with
that
splendid
maxim
of
antiquity
know
thyself
and
boundless
was
my
delight
in
thus
making
my
own
acquaintance
griffith
was
the
sole
spectator
of
this
doll
play
in
which
i
was
at
once
doll
and
child
you
think
you
know
me
you
are
hugely
mistaken
here
is
a
portrait
then
renee
of
your
sister
formerly
disguised
as
a
carmelite
now
brought
to
life
again
as
a
frivolous
society
girl
she
is
one
of
the
greatest
beauties
in
france
provence
of
course
excepted
i
do
see
that
i
can
give
a
more
accurate
summary
of
this
interesting
topic
true
i
have
my
weak
points
but
were
i
a
man
i
should
adore
them
they
arise
from
what
is
most
promising
in
me
when
you
have
spent
a
fortnight
admiring
the
exquisite
curves
of
your
mother
arms
and
that
mother
the
duchesse
de
chaulieu
it
is
impossible
my
dear
not
to
deplore
your
own
angular
elbows
yet
there
is
consolation
in
observing
the
fineness
of
the
wrist
and
a
certain
grace
of
line
in
those
hollows
which
will
yet
fill
out
and
show
plump
round
and
well
modeled
under
the
satiny
skin
the
somewhat
crude
outline
of
the
arms
is
seen
again
in
the
shoulders
strictly
speaking
indeed
i
have
no
shoulders
but
only
two
bony
blades
standing
out
in
harsh
relief
my
figure
also
lacks
pliancy
there
is
a
stiffness
about
the
side
lines
poof
there
the
worst
out
but
then
the
contours
are
bold
and
delicate
the
bright
pure
flame
of
health
bites
into
the
vigorous
lines
a
flood
of
life
and
of
blue
blood
pulses
under
the
transparent
skin
and
the
fairest
daughter
of
eve
would
seem
a
negress
beside
me
i
have
the
foot
of
a
gazelle
my
joints
are
finely
turned
my
features
of
a
greek
correctness
it
is
true
madame
that
the
flesh
tints
do
not
melt
into
each
other
but
at
least
they
stand
out
clear
and
bright
in
short
i
am
a
very
pretty
green
fruit
with
all
the
charm
of
unripeness
i
see
a
great
likeness
to
the
face
in
my
aunt
old
missal
which
rises
out
of
a
violet
lily
there
is
no
silly
weakness
in
the
blue
of
my
insolent
eyes
the
white
is
pure
prettily
marked
with
tiny
veins
and
the
thick
long
lashes
fall
like
a
silken
fringe
my
forehead
sparkles
and
the
hair
grows
deliciously
it
ripples
into
waves
of
pale
gold
growing
browner
towards
the
centre
whence
escape
little
rebel
locks
which
alone
would
tell
that
my
fairness
is
not
of
the
insipid
and
hysterical
type
i
am
a
tropical
blonde
with
plenty
of
blood
in
my
veins
a
blonde
more
apt
to
strike
than
to
turn
the
cheek
what
do
you
think
the
hairdresser
proposed
he
wanted
if
you
please
to
smooth
my
hair
into
two
bands
and
place
over
my
forehead
a
pearl
kept
in
place
by
a
gold
chain
he
said
it
would
recall
the
middle
ages
i
told
him
i
was
not
aged
enough
to
have
reached
the
middle
or
to
need
an
ornament
to
freshen
me
up
the
nose
is
slender
and
the
nostrils
are
separated
by
a
sweet
little
pink
partition
an
imperious
mocking
nose
with
a
tip
too
sensitive
ever
to
grow
fat
or
red
sweetheart
if
this
wo
find
a
husband
for
a
dowerless
maiden
i
a
donkey
the
ears
are
daintily
curled
a
pearl
hanging
from
either
lobe
would
show
yellow
the
neck
is
long
and
has
an
undulating
motion
full
of
dignity
in
the
shade
the
white
ripens
to
a
golden
tinge
perhaps
the
mouth
is
a
little
large
but
how
expressive
what
a
color
on
the
lips
how
prettily
the
teeth
laugh
then
dear
there
is
a
harmony
running
through
all
what
a
gait
what
a
voice
we
have
not
forgotten
how
our
grandmother
skirts
fell
into
place
without
a
touch
in
a
word
i
am
lovely
and
charming
when
the
mood
comes
i
can
laugh
one
of
our
good
old
laughs
and
no
one
will
think
the
less
of
me
the
dimples
impressed
by
comedy
light
fingers
on
my
fair
cheeks
will
command
respect
or
i
can
let
my
eyes
fall
and
my
heart
freeze
under
my
snowy
brows
i
can
pose
as
a
madonna
with
melancholy
neck
and
the
painters
virgins
will
be
nowhere
my
place
in
heaven
would
be
far
above
them
a
man
would
be
forced
to
chant
when
he
spoke
to
me
so
you
see
my
panoply
is
complete
and
i
can
run
the
whole
gamut
of
coquetry
from
deepest
bass
to
shrillest
treble
it
is
a
huge
advantage
not
to
be
all
of
one
piece
now
my
mother
is
neither
playful
nor
virginal
her
only
attitude
is
an
imposing
one
when
she
ceases
to
be
majestic
she
is
ferocious
it
is
difficult
for
her
to
heal
the
wounds
she
makes
whereas
i
can
wound
and
heal
together
we
are
absolutely
unlike
and
therefore
there
could
not
possibly
be
rivalry
between
us
unless
indeed
we
quarreled
over
the
greater
or
less
perfection
of
our
extremities
which
are
similar
i
take
after
my
father
who
is
shrewd
and
subtle
i
have
the
manner
of
my
grandmother
and
her
charming
voice
which
becomes
falsetto
when
forced
but
is
a
chest
voice
at
the
ordinary
pitch
of
a
quiet
talk
i
feel
as
if
i
had
left
the
convent
for
the
first
time
for
society
i
do
not
yet
exist
i
am
unknown
to
it
what
a
ravishing
moment
i
still
belong
only
to
myself
like
a
flower
just
blown
unseen
yet
of
mortal
eye
in
spite
of
this
my
sweet
as
i
paced
the
during
my
and
saw
the
poor
a
queer
feeling
came
over
me
regret
for
the
past
anxiety
about
the
future
fear
of
society
a
long
farewell
to
the
pale
daisies
which
we
used
to
pick
and
strip
of
their
petals
in
innocence
there
was
something
of
all
that
but
strange
fantastic
visions
also
rose
which
i
crushed
back
into
the
inner
depths
whence
they
had
sprung
and
whither
i
dared
not
follow
them
my
renee
i
have
a
regular
trousseau
it
is
all
beautifully
laid
away
and
perfumed
in
the
drawers
with
lacquered
front
of
my
charming
there
are
ribbons
shoes
gloves
all
in
lavish
abundance
my
father
has
kindly
presented
me
with
the
pretty
gewgaws
a
girl
loves
a
toilet
service
fan
sunshade
gold
chain
cashmere
shawl
he
has
also
promised
to
give
me
riding
lessons
and
i
can
dance
yes
evening
i
come
out
my
dress
is
white
muslin
and
on
my
head
i
wear
a
garland
of
white
roses
in
greek
style
i
shall
put
on
my
madonna
face
i
mean
to
play
the
simpleton
and
have
all
the
women
on
my
side
my
mother
is
miles
away
from
any
idea
of
what
i
write
to
you
she
believes
me
quite
destitute
of
mind
and
would
be
dumfounded
if
she
read
my
letter
my
brother
honors
me
with
a
profound
contempt
and
is
uniformly
and
politely
indifferent
he
is
a
handsome
young
fellow
but
melancholy
and
given
to
moods
i
have
divined
his
secret
though
neither
the
duke
nor
duchess
has
an
inkling
of
it
in
spite
of
his
youth
and
his
title
he
is
jealous
of
his
father
he
has
no
position
in
the
state
no
post
at
court
he
never
has
to
say
i
am
going
to
the
chamber
i
alone
in
the
house
have
sixteen
hours
for
meditation
my
father
is
absorbed
in
public
business
and
his
own
amusements
my
mother
too
is
never
at
leisure
no
member
of
the
household
practises
they
are
constantly
in
company
and
have
hardly
time
to
live
i
should
immensely
like
to
know
what
is
the
potent
charm
wielded
by
society
to
keep
people
prisoner
from
nine
every
evening
till
two
or
three
in
the
morning
and
force
them
to
be
so
lavish
alike
of
strength
and
money
when
i
longed
for
it
i
had
no
idea
of
the
separations
it
brought
about
or
its
overmastering
spell
but
then
i
forget
it
is
paris
which
does
it
all
it
is
possible
it
seems
for
members
of
one
family
to
live
side
by
side
and
know
absolutely
nothing
of
each
other
a
nun
arrives
and
in
a
couple
of
weeks
has
grasped
domestic
details
of
which
the
master
diplomatist
at
the
head
of
the
house
is
quite
ignorant
or
perhaps
he
see
and
shuts
his
eyes
deliberately
as
part
of
the
father
there
is
a
mystery
here
which
i
must
plumb
iv
the
same
to
the
same
december
yesterday
at
two
i
went
to
drive
in
the
and
the
bois
de
boulogne
it
was
one
of
those
autumn
days
which
we
used
to
find
so
beautiful
on
the
banks
of
the
loire
so
i
have
seen
paris
at
last
the
place
louis
xv
is
certainly
very
fine
but
the
beauty
is
that
of
man
handiwork
i
was
dressed
to
perfection
pensive
with
set
face
though
inwardly
much
tempted
to
laugh
under
a
lovely
hat
my
arms
crossed
would
you
believe
it
not
a
single
smile
was
thrown
at
me
not
one
poor
youth
was
struck
motionless
as
i
passed
not
a
soul
turned
to
look
again
and
yet
the
carriage
proceeded
with
a
deliberation
worthy
of
my
pose
no
i
am
wrong
there
was
one
a
duke
and
a
charming
man
who
suddenly
reined
in
as
we
went
by
the
individual
who
thus
saved
appearances
for
me
was
my
father
and
he
proclaimed
himself
highly
gratified
by
what
he
saw
i
met
my
mother
also
who
sent
me
a
butterfly
kiss
from
the
tips
of
her
fingers
the
worthy
griffith
who
fears
no
man
cast
her
glances
hither
and
thither
without
discrimination
in
my
judgment
a
young
woman
should
always
know
exactly
what
her
eye
is
resting
on
i
was
mad
with
rage
one
man
actually
inspected
my
carriage
without
noticing
me
this
flattering
homage
probably
came
from
a
i
have
been
quite
out
in
the
reckoning
of
my
forces
plainly
beauty
that
rare
gift
which
comes
from
heaven
is
commoner
in
paris
than
i
thought
i
saw
hats
doffed
with
deference
to
simpering
fools
a
purple
face
called
forth
murmurs
of
it
is
she
my
mother
received
an
immense
amount
of
admiration
there
is
an
answer
to
this
problem
and
i
mean
to
find
it
the
men
my
dear
seemed
to
me
generally
very
ugly
the
very
few
exceptions
are
bad
copies
of
us
heaven
knows
what
evil
genius
has
inspired
their
costume
it
is
amazingly
inelegant
compared
with
those
of
former
generations
it
has
no
distinction
no
beauty
of
color
or
romance
it
appeals
neither
to
the
senses
nor
the
mind
nor
the
eye
and
it
must
be
very
uncomfortable
it
is
meagre
and
stunted
the
hat
above
all
struck
me
it
is
a
sort
of
truncated
column
and
does
not
adapt
itself
in
the
least
to
the
shape
of
the
head
but
i
am
told
it
is
easier
to
bring
about
a
revolution
than
to
invent
a
graceful
hat
courage
in
paris
recoils
before
the
thought
of
appearing
in
a
round
felt
and
for
lack
of
one
day
daring
men
stick
all
their
lives
to
this
ridiculous
headpiece
and
yet
frenchmen
are
said
to
be
fickle
the
men
are
hideous
anyway
whatever
they
put
on
their
heads
i
have
seen
nothing
but
worn
hard
faces
with
no
calm
nor
peace
in
the
expression
the
harsh
lines
and
furrows
speak
of
foiled
ambition
and
smarting
vanity
a
fine
forehead
is
rarely
seen
and
these
are
the
product
of
paris
i
said
to
miss
griffith
most
cultivated
and
pleasant
men
she
replied
i
was
silent
the
heart
of
a
spinster
of
is
a
well
of
tolerance
in
the
evening
i
went
to
the
ball
where
i
kept
close
to
my
side
she
gave
me
her
arm
with
a
devotion
which
did
not
miss
its
reward
all
the
honors
were
for
her
i
was
made
the
pretext
for
charming
compliments
she
was
clever
enough
to
find
me
fools
for
my
partners
who
one
and
all
expatiated
on
the
heat
and
the
beauty
of
the
ball
till
you
might
suppose
i
was
freezing
and
blind
not
one
failed
to
enlarge
on
the
strange
extraordinary
odd
remarkable
fact
that
he
saw
me
for
the
first
time
my
dress
which
dazzled
me
as
i
paraded
alone
in
my
was
barely
noticeable
amidst
the
gorgeous
finery
of
most
of
the
married
women
each
had
her
band
of
faithful
followers
and
they
all
watched
each
other
askance
a
few
were
radiant
in
triumphant
beauty
and
amongst
these
was
my
mother
a
girl
at
a
ball
is
a
mere
a
thing
of
no
consequence
whatever
the
men
with
rare
exceptions
did
not
impress
me
more
favorably
here
than
at
the
they
have
a
look
their
features
are
meaningless
or
rather
they
have
all
the
same
meaning
the
proud
stalwart
bearing
which
we
find
in
the
portraits
of
our
ancestors
men
who
joined
moral
to
physical
vigor
has
disappeared
yet
in
this
gathering
there
was
one
man
of
remarkable
ability
who
stood
out
from
the
rest
by
the
beauty
of
his
face
but
even
he
did
not
rouse
in
me
the
feeling
which
i
should
have
expected
i
do
not
know
his
works
and
he
is
a
man
of
no
family
whatever
the
genius
and
the
merits
of
a
plebeian
or
a
commoner
he
could
never
stir
my
blood
besides
this
man
was
obviously
so
much
more
taken
up
with
himself
than
with
anybody
else
that
i
could
not
but
think
these
great
must
look
on
us
as
things
rather
than
persons
when
men
of
intellectual
power
love
they
ought
to
give
up
writing
otherwise
their
love
is
not
the
real
thing
the
lady
of
their
heart
does
not
come
first
in
all
their
thoughts
i
seemed
to
read
all
this
in
the
bearing
of
the
man
i
speak
of
i
am
told
he
is
a
professor
orator
and
author
whose
ambition
makes
him
the
slave
of
every
bigwig
my
mind
was
made
up
on
the
spot
it
was
unworthy
of
me
i
determined
to
quarrel
with
society
for
not
being
impressed
by
my
merits
and
i
gave
myself
up
to
the
simple
pleasure
of
dancing
which
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
i
heard
a
great
deal
of
inept
gossip
about
people
of
whom
i
know
nothing
but
perhaps
it
is
my
ignorance
on
many
subjects
which
prevents
me
from
appreciating
it
as
i
saw
that
most
men
and
women
took
a
lively
pleasure
in
certain
remarks
whether
falling
from
their
own
lips
or
those
of
others
society
bristles
with
enigmas
which
look
hard
to
solve
it
is
a
perfect
maze
of
intrigue
yet
i
am
fairly
quick
of
sight
and
hearing
and
as
to
my
wits
mlle
de
maucombe
does
not
need
to
be
told
i
returned
home
tired
with
a
pleasant
sort
of
tiredness
and
in
all
innocence
began
describing
my
sensations
to
my
mother
who
was
with
me
she
checked
me
with
the
warning
that
i
must
never
say
such
things
to
any
one
but
her
my
dear
child
she
added
it
needs
as
much
tact
to
know
when
to
be
silent
as
when
to
speak
this
advice
brought
home
to
me
the
nature
of
the
sensations
which
ought
to
be
concealed
from
every
one
not
excepting
perhaps
even
a
mother
at
a
glance
i
measured
the
vast
field
of
feminine
duplicity
i
can
assure
you
sweetheart
that
we
in
our
unabashed
simplicity
would
pass
for
two
very
little
what
lessons
may
be
conveyed
in
a
finger
on
the
lips
in
a
word
a
look
all
in
a
moment
i
was
seized
with
excessive
shyness
what
may
i
never
again
speak
of
the
natural
pleasure
i
feel
in
the
exercise
of
dancing
how
then
i
said
to
myself
about
the
deeper
feelings
i
went
to
bed
sorrowful
and
i
still
suffer
from
the
shock
produced
by
this
first
collision
of
my
frank
joyous
nature
with
the
harsh
laws
of
society
already
the
highway
hedges
are
flecked
with
my
white
wool
farewell
beloved
renee
de
maucombe
to
louise
de
chaulieu
october
how
deeply
your
letter
moved
me
above
all
when
i
compare
our
widely
different
destinies
how
brilliant
is
the
world
you
are
entering
how
peaceful
the
retreat
where
i
shall
end
my
modest
career
in
the
castle
of
maucombe
which
is
so
well
known
to
you
by
description
that
i
shall
say
no
more
of
it
i
found
my
room
almost
exactly
as
i
left
it
only
now
i
can
enjoy
the
splendid
view
it
gives
of
the
gemenos
valley
which
my
childish
eyes
used
to
see
without
comprehending
a
fortnight
after
my
arrival
my
father
and
mother
took
me
along
with
my
two
brothers
to
dine
with
one
of
our
neighbors
de
an
old
gentleman
of
good
family
who
has
made
himself
rich
after
the
provincial
fashion
by
scraping
and
paring
de
was
unable
to
save
his
only
son
from
the
clutches
of
bonaparte
after
successfully
eluding
the
conscription
he
was
forced
to
send
him
to
the
army
in
to
join
the
emperor
bodyguard
after
leipsic
no
more
was
heard
of
him
de
montriveau
whom
the
father
interviewed
in
declared
that
he
had
seen
him
taken
by
the
russians
mme
de
died
of
grief
whilst
a
vain
search
was
being
made
in
russia
the
baron
a
very
pious
old
man
practised
that
fine
theological
virtue
which
we
used
to
cultivate
at
blois
hope
hope
made
him
see
his
son
in
dreams
he
hoarded
his
income
for
him
and
guarded
carefully
the
portion
of
inheritance
which
fell
to
him
from
the
family
of
the
late
mme
de
no
one
venturing
to
ridicule
the
old
man
at
last
it
dawned
upon
me
that
the
unexpected
return
of
this
son
was
the
cause
of
my
own
who
could
have
imagined
whilst
fancy
was
leading
us
a
giddy
dance
that
my
destined
husband
was
slowly
traveling
on
foot
through
russia
poland
and
germany
his
bad
luck
only
forsook
him
at
berlin
where
the
french
minister
helped
his
return
to
his
native
country
de
the
father
who
is
a
small
landed
proprietor
in
provence
with
an
income
of
about
ten
thousand
livres
has
not
sufficient
european
fame
to
interest
the
world
in
the
wandering
knight
de
whose
name
smacks
of
his
adventures
the
accumulated
income
of
twelve
thousand
livres
from
the
property
of
mme
de
with
the
addition
of
the
father
savings
provides
the
poor
guard
of
honor
with
something
like
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
livres
not
counting
house
and
lands
quite
a
considerable
fortune
in
provence
his
worthy
father
had
bought
on
the
very
eve
of
the
chevalier
return
a
fine
but
estate
where
he
designs
to
plant
ten
thousand
raised
in
his
nursery
with
a
special
view
to
this
acquisition
the
baron
having
found
his
son
has
now
but
one
thought
to
marry
him
and
marry
him
to
a
girl
of
good
family
my
father
and
mother
entered
into
their
neighbor
idea
with
an
eye
to
my
interests
so
soon
as
they
discovered
that
renee
de
maucombe
would
be
acceptable
without
a
dowry
and
that
the
money
the
said
renee
ought
to
inherit
from
her
parents
would
be
duly
acknowledged
as
hers
in
the
contract
in
a
similar
way
my
younger
brother
jean
de
maucombe
as
soon
as
he
came
of
age
signed
a
document
stating
that
he
had
received
from
his
parents
an
advance
upon
the
estate
equal
in
amount
to
of
whole
this
is
the
device
by
which
the
nobles
of
provence
elude
the
infamous
civil
code
of
de
bonaparte
a
code
which
will
drive
as
many
girls
of
good
family
into
convents
as
it
will
find
husbands
for
the
french
nobility
from
the
little
i
have
been
able
to
gather
seem
to
be
divided
on
these
matters
the
dinner
darling
was
a
first
meeting
between
your
sweetheart
and
the
exile
the
comte
de
maucombe
servants
donned
their
old
laced
liveries
and
hats
the
coachman
his
great
we
sat
five
in
the
antiquated
carriage
and
arrived
in
state
about
two
the
dinner
was
for
three
at
the
grange
which
is
the
dwelling
of
the
baron
de
my
to
be
has
you
see
no
castle
only
a
simple
country
house
standing
beneath
one
of
our
hills
at
the
entrance
of
that
noble
valley
the
pride
of
which
is
undoubtedly
the
castle
of
maucombe
the
building
is
quite
unpretentious
four
pebble
walls
covered
with
a
yellowish
wash
and
roofed
with
hollow
tiles
of
a
good
red
constitute
the
grange
the
rafters
bend
under
the
weight
of
this
the
windows
inserted
casually
without
any
attempt
at
symmetry
have
enormous
shutters
painted
yellow
the
garden
in
which
it
stands
is
a
provencal
garden
enclosed
by
low
walls
built
of
big
round
pebbles
set
in
layers
alternately
sloping
or
upright
according
to
the
artistic
taste
of
the
mason
which
finds
here
its
only
outlet
the
mud
in
which
they
are
set
is
falling
away
in
places
thanks
to
an
iron
railing
at
the
entrance
facing
the
road
this
simple
farm
has
a
certain
air
of
being
a
the
railing
long
sought
with
tears
is
so
emaciated
that
it
recalled
sister
angelique
to
me
a
flight
of
stone
steps
leads
to
the
door
which
is
protected
by
a
roof
such
as
no
peasant
on
the
loire
would
tolerate
for
his
coquettish
white
stone
house
with
its
blue
roof
glittering
in
the
sun
the
garden
and
surrounding
walks
are
horribly
dusty
and
the
trees
seem
burnt
up
it
is
easy
to
see
that
for
years
the
baron
life
has
been
a
mere
rising
up
and
going
to
bed
again
day
after
day
without
a
thought
beyond
that
of
piling
up
coppers
he
eats
the
same
food
as
his
two
servants
a
provencal
lad
and
the
old
woman
who
used
to
wait
on
his
wife
the
rooms
are
scantily
furnished
nevertheless
the
house
of
had
done
its
best
the
cupboards
had
been
ransacked
and
its
last
man
beaten
up
for
the
dinner
which
was
served
to
us
on
old
silver
dishes
blackened
and
battered
the
exile
my
darling
pet
is
like
the
railing
emaciated
he
is
pale
and
silent
and
bears
traces
of
suffering
at
he
might
be
fifty
the
once
beautiful
ebon
locks
of
youth
are
streaked
with
white
like
a
wing
his
fine
blue
eyes
are
cavernous
he
is
a
little
deaf
which
suggests
the
knight
of
the
sorrowful
countenance
spite
of
all
this
i
have
graciously
consented
to
become
mme
de
and
to
receive
a
dowry
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
livres
but
only
on
the
express
condition
of
being
allowed
to
work
my
will
upon
the
grange
and
make
a
park
there
i
have
demanded
from
my
father
in
set
terms
a
grant
of
water
which
can
be
brought
thither
from
maucombe
in
a
month
i
shall
be

have
made
a
good
impression
after
the
snows
of
siberia
a
man

ready
enough
to
see
merit
in
those
black
eyes

empyrean
whither
together
we
had
soared
into
the
vulgar
realities
of
a
life
as
homely
as
a
daisy
i
have
vowed
to
myself
to
comfort
this
young
man
who
has
never
known
youth
but
passed
straight
from
his
mother
arms
to
the
embrace
of
war
and
from
the
joys
of
his
country
home
to
the
frosts
and
forced
labor
of
siberia
humble
country
pleasures
will
enliven
the
monotony
of
my
future
it
shall
be
my
ambition
to
enlarge
the
oasis
round
my
house
and
to
give
it
the
lordly
shade
of
fine
trees
my
turf
though
provencal
shall
be
always
green
i
shall
carry
my
park
up
the
hillside
and
plant
on
the
highest
point
some
pretty
kiosque
whence
perhaps
my
eyes
may
catch
the
shimmer
of
the
mediterranean
orange
and
lemon
trees
and
all
choicest
things
that
grow
shall
embellish
my
retreat
and
there
will
i
be
a
mother
among
my
children
the
poetry
of
nature
which
nothing
can
destroy
shall
hedge
us
round
and
standing
loyally
at
the
post
of
duty
we
need
fear
no
danger
my
religious
feelings
are
shared
by
my
and
by
the
chevalier
ah
darling
my
life
unrolls
itself
before
my
eyes
like
one
of
the
great
highways
of
france
level
and
easy
shaded
with
evergreen
trees
this
century
will
not
see
another
bonaparte
and
my
children
if
i
have
any
will
not
be
rent
from
me
they
will
be
mine
to
train
and
make
men
of
the
joy
of
my
life
if
you
also
are
true
to
your
destiny
you
who
ought
to
find
your
mate
amongst
the
great
ones
of
the
earth
the
children
of
your
renee
will
not
lack
a
zealous
protectress
farewell
then
for
me
at
least
to
the
romances
and
thrilling
adventures
in
which
we
used
ourselves
to
play
the
part
of
heroine
the
whole
story
of
my
life
lies
before
me
now
its
great
crises
will
be
the
teething
and
nutrition
of
the
young
masters
de
and
the
mischief
they
do
to
my
shrubs
and
me
to
embroider
their
caps
to
be
loved
and
admired
by
a
sickly
man
at
the
mouth
of
the
gemenos
valley
there
are
my
pleasures
perhaps
some
day
the
country
dame
may
go
and
spend
a
winter
in
marseilles
but
danger
does
not
haunt
the
purlieus
of
a
narrow
provincial
stage
there
will
be
nothing
to
fear
not
even
an
admiration
such
as
could
only
make
a
woman
proud
we
shall
take
a
great
deal
of
interest
in
the
silkworms
for
whose
benefit
our
will
be
sold
we
shall
know
the
strange
vicissitudes
of
life
in
provence
and
the
storms
that
may
attack
even
a
peaceful
household
quarrels
will
be
impossible
for
de
has
formally
announced
that
he
will
leave
the
reins
in
his
wife
hands
and
as
i
shall
do
nothing
to
remind
him
of
this
wise
resolve
it
is
likely
he
may
persevere
in
it
you
my
dear
louise
will
supply
the
romance
of
my
life
so
you
must
narrate
to
me
in
full
all
your
adventures
describe
your
balls
and
parties
tell
me
what
you
wear
what
flowers
crown
your
lovely
golden
locks
and
what
are
the
words
and
manners
of
the
men
you
meet
your
other
self
will
be
always
there
listening
dancing
feeling
her
pressed
with
you
if
only
i
could
have
some
fun
in
paris
now
and
then
while
you
played
the
at
la
crampade
such
is
the
name
of
our
grange
poor
de
who
fancies
he
is
marrying
one
woman
will
he
find
out
there
are
two
i
am
writing
nonsense
now
and
as
henceforth
i
can
only
be
foolish
by
proxy
i
had
better
stop
one
kiss
then
on
each
cheek
my
lips
are
still
virginal
he
has
only
dared
to
take
my
hand
oh
our
deference
and
propriety
are
quite
disquieting
i
assure
you
there
i
am
off
again
dear
i
have
just
opened
your
third
letter
my
dear
i
have
about
one
thousand
livres
to
dispose
of
spend
them
for
me
on
pretty
things
such
as
we
ca
find
here
nor
even
at
marseilles
while
speeding
on
your
own
business
give
a
thought
to
the
recluse
of
la
crampade
remember
that
on
neither
side
have
the
heads
of
the
family
any
people
of
taste
in
paris
to
make
their
purchases
i
shall
reply
to
your
letter
later
vi
don
felipe
henarez
to
don
fernand
paris
september
the
address
of
this
letter
my
brother
will
show
you
that
the
head
of
your
house
is
out
of
reach
of
danger
if
the
massacre
of
our
ancestors
in
the
court
of
lions
made
spaniards
and
christians
of
us
against
our
will
it
left
us
a
legacy
of
arab
cunning
and
it
may
be
that
i
owe
my
safety
to
the
blood
of
the
abencerrages
still
flowing
in
my
veins
fear
made
ferdinand
acting
so
good
that
valdez
actually
believed
in
his
protestations
but
for
me
the
poor
admiral
would
have
been
done
for
nothing
it
seems
will
teach
the
liberals
what
a
king
is
this
particular
bourbon
has
been
long
known
to
me
and
the
more
his
majesty
assured
me
of
his
protection
the
stronger
grew
my
suspicions
a
true
spaniard
has
no
need
to
repeat
a
promise
a
flow
of
words
is
a
sure
sign
of
duplicity
valdez
took
ship
on
an
english
vessel
for
myself
no
sooner
did
i
see
the
cause
of
my
beloved
spain
wrecked
in
andalusia
than
i
wrote
to
the
steward
of
my
sardinian
estate
to
make
arrangements
for
my
escape
some
hardy
coral
fishers
were
despatched
to
wait
for
me
at
a
point
on
the
coast
and
when
ferdinand
urged
the
french
to
secure
my
person
i
was
already
in
my
barony
of
macumer
amidst
brigands
who
defy
all
law
and
all
avengers
the
last
family
of
granada
has
found
once
more
the
shelter
of
an
african
desert
and
even
a
saracen
horse
in
an
estate
which
comes
to
it
from
saracens
how
the
eyes
of
these
brigands
who
but
yesterday
had
dreaded
my
authority
sparkled
with
savage
joy
and
pride
when
they
found
they
were
protecting
against
the
king
of
vendetta
the
duc
de
soria
their
master
and
a
henarez
the
first
who
had
come
to
visit
them
since
the
time
when
the
island
belonged
to
the
moors
more
than
a
score
of
rifles
were
ready
to
point
at
ferdinand
of
bourbon
son
of
a
race
which
was
still
unknown
when
the
abencerrages
arrived
as
conquerors
on
the
banks
of
the
loire
my
idea
had
been
to
live
on
the
income
of
these
huge
estates
which
unfortunately
we
have
so
greatly
neglected
but
my
stay
there
convinced
me
that
this
was
impossible
and
that
queverdo
reports
were
only
too
correct
the
poor
man
had
lives
at
my
disposal
and
not
a
single
prairies
of
twenty
thousand
acres
and
not
a
house
virgin
forests
and
not
a
stick
of
furniture
a
million
piastres
and
a
resident
master
for
half
a
century
would
be
necessary
to
make
these
magnificent
lands
pay
i
must
see
to
this
the
conquered
have
time
during
their
flight
to
ponder
their
own
case
and
that
of
their
vanquished
party
at
the
spectacle
of
my
noble
country
a
corpse
for
monks
to
prey
on
my
eyes
filled
with
tears
i
read
in
it
the
presage
of
spain
gloomy
future
at
marseilles
i
heard
of
riego
end
painfully
did
it
come
home
to
me
that
my
life
also
would
henceforth
be
a
martyrdom
but
a
martyrdom
protracted
and
unnoticed
is
existence
worthy
the
name
when
a
man
can
no
longer
die
for
his
country
or
live
for
a
woman
to
love
to
conquer
this
twofold
form
of
the
same
thought
is
the
law
graven
on
our
sabres
emblazoned
on
the
vaulted
roofs
of
our
palaces
ceaselessly
whispered
by
the
water
which
rises
and
falls
in
our
marble
fountains
but
in
vain
does
it
nerve
my
heart
the
sabre
is
broken
the
palace
in
ashes
the
living
spring
sucked
up
by
the
barren
sand
here
then
is
my
last
will
and
testament
don
fernand
you
will
understand
now
why
i
put
a
check
upon
your
ardor
and
ordered
you
to
remain
faithful
to
the
as
your
brother
and
friend
i
implore
you
to
obey
me
as
your
master
i
command
you
will
go
to
the
king
and
will
ask
from
him
the
grant
of
my
dignities
and
property
my
office
and
titles
he
will
perhaps
hesitate
and
may
treat
you
to
some
regal
scowls
but
you
must
tell
him
that
you
are
loved
by
marie
heredia
and
that
marie
can
marry
none
but
a
duc
de
soria
this
will
make
the
king
radiant
it
is
the
immense
fortune
of
the
heredia
family
which
alone
has
stood
between
him
and
the
accomplishment
of
my
ruin
your
proposal
will
seem
to
him
therefore
to
deprive
me
of
a
last
resource
and
he
will
gladly
hand
over
to
you
my
spoils
you
will
then
marry
marie
the
secret
of
the
mutual
love
against
which
you
fought
was
no
secret
to
me
and
i
have
prepared
the
old
count
to
see
you
take
my
place
marie
and
i
were
merely
doing
what
was
expected
of
us
in
our
position
and
carrying
out
the
wishes
of
our
fathers
everything
else
is
in
your
favor
you
are
beautiful
as
a
child
of
love
and
are
possessed
of
marie
heart
i
am
an
spanish
grandee
for
whom
she
feels
an
aversion
to
which
she
will
not
confess
some
slight
reluctance
there
may
be
on
the
part
of
the
noble
spanish
girl
on
account
of
my
misfortunes
but
this
you
will
soon
overcome
duc
de
soria
your
predecessor
would
neither
cost
you
a
regret
nor
rob
you
of
a
maravedi
my
mother
diamonds
which
will
suffice
to
make
me
independent
i
will
keep
because
the
gap
caused
by
them
in
the
family
estate
can
be
filled
by
marie
jewels
you
can
send
them
therefore
by
my
nurse
old
urraca
the
only
one
of
my
servants
whom
i
wish
to
retain
no
one
can
prepare
my
chocolate
as
she
does
during
our
brief
revolution
my
life
of
unremitting
toil
was
reduced
to
the
barest
necessaries
and
these
my
salary
was
sufficient
to
provide
you
will
therefore
find
the
income
of
the
last
two
years
in
the
hands
of
your
steward
this
sum
is
mine
but
a
duc
de
soria
can
not
marry
without
a
large
expenditure
of
money
therefore
we
will
divide
it
you
will
not
refuse
this
from
your
brigand
brother
besides
i
mean
to
have
it
so
the
barony
of
macumer
not
being
spanish
territory
remains
to
me
thus
i
have
still
a
country
and
a
name
should
i
wish
to
take
up
a
position
in
the
world
again
thank
heaven
this
finishes
our
business
and
the
house
of
soria
is
saved
at
the
very
moment
when
i
drop
into
simple
baron
de
macumer
the
french
cannon
announce
the
arrival
of
the
duc
you
will
understand
why
i
break
off
october
when
i
arrived
here
i
had
not
ten
doubloons
in
my
pocket
he
would
indeed
be
a
poor
sort
of
leader
who
in
the
midst
of
calamities
he
has
not
been
able
to
avert
has
found
means
to
feather
his
own
nest
for
the
vanquished
moor
there
remains
a
horse
and
the
desert
for
the
christian
foiled
of
his
hopes
the
cloister
and
a
few
gold
pieces
but
my
present
resignation
is
mere
weariness
i
am
not
yet
so
near
the
monastery
as
to
have
abandoned
all
thoughts
of
life
ozalga
had
given
me
several
letters
of
introduction
to
meet
all
emergencies
amongst
these
one
to
a
bookseller
who
takes
with
our
the
place
which
galignani
holds
with
the
english
in
paris
this
man
has
found
eight
pupils
for
me
at
three
francs
a
lesson
i
go
to
my
pupils
every
alternate
day
so
that
i
have
four
lessons
a
day
and
earn
twelve
francs
which
is
more
than
i
require
when
urraca
comes
i
shall
make
some
spanish
exile
happy
by
passing
on
to
him
my
connection
i
lodge
in
the
rue
with
a
poor
widow
who
takes
boarders
my
room
faces
south
and
looks
out
on
a
little
garden
it
is
perfectly
quiet
i
have
green
trees
to
look
upon
and
spend
the
sum
of
one
piastre
a
day
i
am
amazed
at
the
amount
of
calm
pure
pleasure
which
i
enjoy
in
this
life
after
the
fashion
of
dionysius
at
corinth
from
sunrise
until
ten
i
smoke
and
take
my
chocolate
sitting
at
my
window
and
contemplating
two
spanish
plants
a
broom
which
rises
out
of
a
clump
of
jessamine
gold
on
a
white
ground
colors
which
must
send
a
thrill
through
any
scion
of
the
moors
at
ten
i
start
for
my
lessons
which
last
till
four
when
i
return
for
dinner
afterwards
i
read
and
smoke
till
i
go
to
bed
i
can
put
up
for
a
long
time
with
a
life
like
this
compounded
of
work
and
meditation
of
solitude
and
society
be
happy
therefore
fernand
my
abdication
has
brought
no
afterthoughts
i
have
no
regrets
like
charles
no
longing
to
try
the
game
again
like
napoleon
five
days
and
nights
have
passed
since
i
wrote
my
will
to
my
mind
they
might
have
been
five
centuries
honor
titles
wealth
are
for
me
as
though
they
had
never
existed
now
that
the
conventional
barrier
of
respect
which
hedged
me
round
has
fallen
i
can
open
my
heart
to
you
dear
boy
though
cased
in
the
armor
of
gravity
this
heart
is
full
of
tenderness
and
devotion
which
have
found
no
object
and
which
no
woman
has
divined
not
even
she
who
from
her
cradle
has
been
my
destined
bride
in
this
lies
the
secret
of
my
political
enthusiasm
spain
has
taken
the
place
of
a
mistress
and
received
the
homage
of
my
heart
and
now
spain
too
is
gone
beggared
of
all
i
can
gaze
upon
the
ruin
of
what
once
was
me
and
speculate
over
the
mysteries
of
my
being
why
did
life
animate
this
carcass
and
when
will
it
depart
why
has
that
race
in
chivalry
breathed
all
its
primitive
virtues
its
tropical
love
its
fiery
poetry
into
this
its
last
offshoot
if
the
seed
was
never
to
burst
its
rugged
shell
if
no
stem
was
to
spring
forth
no
radiant
flower
scatter
aloft
its
eastern
perfumes
of
what
crime
have
i
been
guilty
before
my
birth
that
i
can
inspire
no
love
did
fate
from
my
very
infancy
decree
that
i
should
be
stranded
a
useless
hulk
on
some
barren
shore
i
find
in
my
soul
the
image
of
the
deserts
where
my
fathers
ranged
illumined
by
a
scorching
sun
which
shrivels
up
all
life
proud
remnant
of
a
fallen
race
vain
force
love
run
to
waste
an
old
man
in
the
prime
of
youth
here
better
than
elsewhere
shall
i
await
the
last
grace
of
death
alas
under
this
murky
sky
no
spark
will
kindle
these
ashes
again
to
flame
thus
my
last
words
may
be
those
of
christ
god
thou
hast
forsaken
me
cry
of
agony
and
terror
to
the
core
of
which
no
mortal
has
ventured
yet
to
penetrate
you
can
realize
now
fernand
what
a
joy
it
is
to
me
to
live
afresh
in
you
and
marie
i
shall
watch
you
henceforth
with
the
pride
of
a
creator
satisfied
in
his
work
love
each
other
well
and
go
on
loving
if
you
would
not
give
me
pain
any
discord
between
you
would
hurt
me
more
than
it
would
yourselves
our
mother
had
a
presentiment
that
events
would
one
day
serve
her
wishes
it
may
be
that
the
longing
of
a
mother
constitutes
a
pact
between
herself
and
god
was
she
not
moreover
one
of
those
mysterious
beings
who
can
hold
converse
with
heaven
and
bring
back
thence
a
vision
of
the
future
how
often
have
i
not
read
in
the
lines
of
her
forehead
that
she
was
coveting
for
fernand
the
honors
and
the
wealth
of
felipe
when
i
said
so
to
her
she
would
reply
with
tears
laying
bare
the
wounds
of
a
heart
which
of
right
was
the
undivided
property
of
both
her
sons
but
which
an
irresistible
passion
gave
to
you
alone
her
spirit
therefore
will
hover
joyfully
above
your
heads
as
you
bow
them
at
the
altar
my
mother
have
you
not
a
caress
for
your
felipe
now
that
he
has
yielded
to
your
favorite
even
the
girl
whom
you
regretfully
thrust
into
his
arms
what
i
have
done
is
pleasing
to
our
womankind
to
the
dead
and
to
the
king
it
is
the
will
of
god
make
no
difficulty
then
fernand
obey
and
be
silent
tell
urraca
to
be
sure
and
call
me
nothing
but
henarez
say
a
word
about
me
to
marie
you
must
be
the
one
living
soul
to
know
the
secrets
of
the
last
christianized
moor
in
whose
veins
runs
the
blood
of
a
great
family
which
took
its
rise
in
the
desert
and
is
now
about
to
die
out
in
the
person
of
a
solitary
exile
farewell
vii
louise
de
chaulieu
to
renee
de
maucombe
what
to
be
married
so
soon
but
this
is
unheard
of
at
the
end
of
a
month
you
become
engaged
to
a
man
who
is
a
stranger
to
you
and
about
whom
you
know
nothing
the
man
may
be
deaf
there
are
so
many
kinds
of
deafness
he
may
be
sickly
tiresome
insufferable
do
you
see
renee
what
they
want
with
you
you
are
needful
for
carrying
on
the
glorious
stock
of
the
that
is
all
you
will
be
buried
in
the
provinces
are
these
the
promises
we
made
each
other
were
i
you
i
would
sooner
set
off
to
the
hyeres
islands
in
a
caique
on
the
chance
of
being
captured
by
an
algerian
corsair
and
sold
to
the
grand
turk
then
i
should
be
a
sultana
some
day
and
would
i
make
a
stir
in
the
harem
while
i
was
young
yes
and
afterwards
too
you
are
leaving
one
convent
to
enter
another
i
know
you
you
are
a
coward
and
you
will
submit
to
the
yoke
of
family
life
with
a
lamblike
docility
but
i
am
here
to
direct
you
you
must
come
to
paris
there
we
shall
drive
the
men
wild
and
hold
a
court
like
queens
your
husband
sweetheart
in
three
years
from
now
may
become
a
member
of
the
chamber
i
know
all
about
members
now
and
i
will
explain
it
to
you
you
will
work
that
machine
very
well
you
can
live
in
paris
and
become
there
what
my
mother
calls
a
woman
of
fashion
oh
you
need
suppose
i
will
leave
you
in
your
grange
monday
for
a
whole
fortnight
now
my
dear
i
have
been
living
the
life
of
society
one
evening
at
the
italiens
another
at
the
grand
opera
and
always
a
ball
afterwards
ah
society
is
a
witching
world
the
music
of
the
opera
enchants
me
and
whilst
my
soul
is
plunged
in
divine
pleasure
i
am
the
centre
of
admiration
and
the
focus
of
all
the
but
a
single
glance
will
make
the
boldest
youth
drop
his
eyes
i
have
seen
some
charming
young
men
there
all
the
same
i
do
care
for
any
of
them
not
one
has
roused
in
me
the
emotion
which
i
feel
when
i
listen
to
garcia
in
his
splendid
duet
with
pellegrini
in
heavens
how
jealous
rossini
must
have
been
to
express
jealousy
so
well
what
a
cry
in
il
mio
cor
si
divide
i
speaking
greek
to
you
for
you
never
heard
garcia
but
then
you
know
how
jealous
i
am
what
a
wretched
dramatist
shakespeare
is
othello
is
in
love
with
glory
he
wins
battles
he
gives
orders
he
struts
about
and
is
all
over
the
place
while
desdemona
sits
at
home
and
desdemona
who
sees
herself
neglected
for
the
silly
fuss
of
public
life
is
quite
meek
all
the
time
such
a
sheep
deserves
to
be
slaughtered
let
the
man
whom
i
deign
to
love
beware
how
he
thinks
of
anything
but
loving
me
for
my
part
i
like
those
long
trials
of
the
chivalry
that
lout
of
a
young
lord
who
took
offence
because
his
sent
him
down
among
the
lions
to
fetch
her
glove
was
in
my
opinion
very
impertinent
and
a
fool
too
doubtless
the
lady
had
in
reserve
for
him
some
exquisite
flower
of
love
which
he
lost
as
he
well
deserved
the
puppy
but
here
am
i
running
on
as
though
i
had
not
a
great
piece
of
news
to
tell
you
my
father
is
certainly
going
to
represent
our
master
the
king
at
madrid
i
say
master
for
i
shall
make
part
of
the
embassy
my
mother
wishes
to
remain
here
and
my
father
will
take
me
so
as
to
have
some
woman
with
him
my
dear
this
seems
to
you
no
doubt
very
simple
but
there
are
horrors
behind
it
all
the
same
in
a
fortnight
i
have
probed
the
secrets
of
the
house
my
mother
would
accompany
my
father
to
madrid
if
he
would
take
de
canalis
as
a
secretary
to
the
embassy
but
the
king
appoints
the
secretaries
the
duke
dare
neither
annoy
the
king
who
hates
to
be
opposed
nor
vex
my
mother
and
the
wily
diplomat
believes
he
has
cut
the
knot
by
leaving
the
duchess
here
de
canalis
who
is
the
great
poet
of
the
day
is
the
young
man
who
cultivates
my
mother
society
and
who
no
doubt
studies
diplomacy
with
her
from
three
to
five
diplomacy
must
be
a
fine
subject
for
he
is
as
regular
as
a
gambler
on
the
stock
exchange
the
duc
de
rhetore
our
elder
brother
solemn
cold
and
whimsical
would
be
extinguished
by
his
father
at
madrid
therefore
he
remains
in
paris
miss
griffith
has
found
out
also
that
alphonse
is
in
love
with
a
at
the
opera
how
is
it
possible
to
fall
in
love
with
legs
and
pirouettes
we
have
noticed
that
my
brother
comes
to
the
theatre
only
when
tullia
dances
there
he
applauds
the
steps
of
this
creature
and
then
goes
out
two
in
a
family
are
i
fancy
more
destructive
than
the
plague
my
second
brother
is
with
his
regiment
and
i
have
not
yet
seen
him
thus
it
comes
about
that
i
have
to
act
as
the
antigone
of
his
majesty
ambassador
perhaps
i
may
get
married
in
spain
and
perhaps
my
father
idea
is
a
marriage
there
without
dowry
after
the
pattern
of
yours
with
this
guard
of
honor
my
father
asked
if
i
would
go
with
him
and
offered
me
the
use
of
his
spanish
master
spain
the
country
for
castles
in
the
air
i
cried
perhaps
you
hope
that
it
may
mean
marriages
for
me
for
sole
reply
he
honored
me
with
a
meaning
look
for
some
days
he
has
amused
himself
with
teasing
me
at
lunch
he
watches
me
and
i
dissemble
in
this
way
i
have
played
with
him
cruelly
as
father
and
ambassador
had
he
taken
me
for
a
fool
he
asked
me
what
i
thought
of
this
and
that
young
man
and
of
some
girls
whom
i
had
met
in
several
houses
i
replied
with
quite
inane
remarks
on
the
color
of
their
hair
their
faces
and
the
difference
in
their
figures
my
father
seemed
disappointed
at
my
crassness
and
inwardly
blamed
himself
for
having
asked
me
still
father
i
added
do
suppose
i
am
saying
what
i
really
think
mother
made
me
afraid
the
other
day
that
i
had
spoken
more
frankly
than
i
ought
of
my
impressions
with
your
family
you
can
speak
quite
freely
my
mother
replied
very
well
then
i
went
on
the
young
men
i
have
met
so
far
strike
me
as
too
to
excite
interest
in
others
they
are
much
more
taken
up
with
themselves
than
with
their
company
they
ca
be
accused
of
lack
of
candor
at
any
rate
they
put
on
a
certain
expression
to
talk
to
us
and
drop
it
again
in
a
moment
apparently
satisfied
that
we
use
our
eyes
the
man
as
he
converses
is
the
lover
silent
he
is
the
husband
the
girls
again
are
so
artificial
that
it
is
impossible
to
know
what
they
really
are
except
from
the
way
they
dance
their
figures
and
movements
alone
are
not
a
sham
but
what
has
alarmed
me
most
in
this
fashionable
society
is
its
brutality
the
little
incidents
which
take
place
when
supper
is
announced
give
one
some
idea
to
compare
small
things
with
great
of
what
a
popular
rising
might
be
courtesy
is
only
a
thin
veneer
on
the
general
selfishness
i
imagined
society
very
different
women
count
for
little
in
it
that
may
perhaps
be
a
survival
of
bonapartist
ideas
armande
is
coming
on
extraordinarily
said
my
mother
mother
did
you
think
i
should
never
get
beyond
asking
to
see
mme
de
stael
my
father
smiled
and
rose
from
the
table
saturday
my
dear
i
have
left
one
thing
out
here
is
the
tidbit
i
have
reserved
for
you
the
love
which
we
pictured
must
be
extremely
well
hidden
i
have
seen
not
a
trace
of
it
true
i
have
caught
in
now
and
again
a
quick
exchange
of
glances
but
how
colorless
it
all
is
love
as
we
imagined
it
a
world
of
wonders
of
glorious
dreams
of
charming
realities
of
sorrows
that
waken
sympathy
and
smiles
that
make
sunshine
does
not
exist
the
bewitching
words
the
constant
interchange
of
happiness
the
misery
of
absence
the
flood
of
joy
at
the
presence
of
the
beloved
one
where
are
they
what
soil
produces
these
radiant
flowers
of
the
soul
which
is
wrong
we
or
the
world
i
have
already
seen
hundreds
of
men
young
and
not
one
has
stirred
the
least
feeling
in
me
no
proof
of
admiration
and
devotion
on
their
part
not
even
a
sword
drawn
in
my
behalf
would
have
moved
me
love
dear
is
the
product
of
such
rare
conditions
that
it
is
quite
possible
to
live
a
lifetime
without
coming
across
the
being
on
whom
nature
has
bestowed
the
power
of
making
one
happiness
the
thought
is
enough
to
make
one
shudder
for
if
this
being
is
found
too
late
what
then
for
some
days
i
have
begun
to
tremble
when
i
think
of
the
destiny
of
women
and
to
understand
why
so
many
wear
a
sad
face
beneath
the
flush
brought
by
the
unnatural
excitement
of
social
dissipation
marriage
is
a
mere
matter
of
chance
look
at
yours
a
storm
of
wild
thoughts
has
passed
over
my
mind
to
be
loved
every
day
the
same
yet
with
a
difference
to
be
loved
as
much
after
ten
years
of
happiness
as
on
the
first
day
such
a
love
demands
years
the
lover
must
be
allowed
to
languish
curiosity
must
be
piqued
and
satisfied
feeling
roused
and
responded
to
is
there
then
a
law
for
the
inner
fruits
of
the
heart
as
there
is
for
the
visible
fruits
of
nature
can
joy
be
made
lasting
in
what
proportion
should
love
mingle
tears
with
pleasures
the
cold
policy
of
the
funereal
monotonous
persistent
routine
of
the
convent
seemed
to
me
at
these
moments
the
only
real
life
while
the
wealth
the
splendor
the
tears
the
delights
the
triumph
the
joy
the
satisfaction
of
a
love
equal
shared
and
sanctioned
appeared
a
mere
idle
vision
i
see
no
room
in
this
city
for
the
gentle
ways
of
love
for
precious
walks
in
shady
alleys
the
full
moon
sparkling
on
the
water
while
the
suppliant
pleads
in
vain
rich
young
and
beautiful
i
have
only
to
love
and
love
would
become
my
sole
occupation
my
life
yet
in
the
three
months
during
which
i
have
come
and
gone
eager
and
curious
nothing
has
appealed
to
me
in
the
bright
covetous
keen
eyes
around
me
no
voice
has
thrilled
me
no
glance
has
made
the
world
seem
brighter
music
alone
has
filled
my
soul
music
alone
has
at
all
taken
the
place
of
our
friendship
sometimes
at
night
i
will
linger
for
an
hour
by
my
window
gazing
into
the
garden
summoning
the
future
with
all
it
brings
out
of
the
mystery
which
shrouds
it
there
are
days
too
when
having
started
for
a
drive
i
get
out
and
walk
in
the
and
picture
to
myself
that
the
man
who
is
to
waken
my
slumbering
soul
is
at
hand
that
he
will
follow
and
look
at
me
then
i
meet
only
mountebanks
vendors
of
gingerbread
jugglers
hurrying
to
their
business
or
lovers
who
try
to
escape
notice
these
i
am
tempted
to
stop
asking
them
you
who
are
happy
tell
me
what
is
love
but
the
impulse
is
repressed
and
i
return
to
my
carriage
swearing
to
die
an
old
maid
love
is
undoubtedly
an
incarnation
and
how
many
conditions
are
needful
before
it
can
take
place
we
are
not
certain
of
never
quarreling
with
ourselves
how
much
less
so
when
there
are
two
this
is
a
problem
which
god
alone
can
solve
i
begin
to
think
that
i
shall
return
to
the
convent
if
i
remain
in
society
i
shall
do
things
which
will
look
like
follies
for
i
can
not
possibly
reconcile
myself
to
what
i
see
i
am
perpetually
wounded
either
in
my
sense
of
delicacy
my
inner
principles
or
my
secret
thoughts
ah
my
mother
is
the
happiest
of
women
adored
as
she
is
by
canalis
her
great
little
man
my
love
do
you
know
i
am
seized
sometimes
with
a
horrible
craving
to
know
what
goes
on
between
my
mother
and
that
young
man
griffith
tells
me
she
has
gone
through
all
these
moods
she
has
longed
to
fly
at
women
whose
happiness
was
written
in
their
face
she
has
blackened
their
character
torn
them
to
pieces
according
to
her
virtue
consists
in
burying
all
these
savage
instincts
in
one
innermost
heart
but
what
then
of
the
heart
it
becomes
the
sink
of
all
that
is
worst
in
us
it
is
very
humiliating
that
no
adorer
has
yet
turned
up
for
me
i
am
a
marriageable
girl
but
i
have
brothers
a
family
relations
who
are
sensitive
on
the
point
of
honor
ah
if
that
is
what
keeps
men
back
they
are
poltroons
the
part
of
chimene
in
the
and
that
of
the
cid
delight
me
what
a
marvelous
play
well
viii
the
same
to
the
same
january
our
master
is
a
poor
refugee
forced
to
keep
in
hiding
on
account
of
the
part
he
played
in
the
revolution
which
the
duc
has
just
quelled
a
triumph
to
which
we
owe
some
splendid
fetes
though
a
liberal
and
doubtless
a
man
of
the
people
he
has
awakened
my
interest
i
fancy
that
he
must
have
been
condemned
to
death
i
make
him
talk
for
the
purpose
of
getting
at
his
secret
but
he
is
of
a
truly
castilian
taciturnity
proud
as
though
he
were
gonsalvo
di
cordova
and
nevertheless
angelic
in
his
patience
and
gentleness
his
pride
is
not
irritable
like
miss
griffith
it
belongs
to
his
inner
nature
he
forces
us
to
civility
because
his
own
manners
are
so
perfect
and
holds
us
at
a
distance
by
the
respect
he
shows
us
my
father
declares
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
the
nobleman
in
senor
henarez
whom
among
ourselves
he
calls
in
fun
don
henarez
a
few
days
ago
i
took
the
liberty
of
addressing
him
thus
he
raised
his
eyes
which
are
generally
bent
on
the
ground
and
flashed
a
look
from
them
that
quite
abashed
me
my
dear
he
certainly
has
the
most
beautiful
eyes
imaginable
i
asked
him
if
i
had
offended
him
in
any
way
and
he
said
to
me
in
his
grand
rolling
spanish
i
am
here
only
to
teach
you
spanish
i
blushed
and
felt
quite
snubbed
i
was
on
the
point
of
making
some
pert
answer
when
i
remembered
what
our
dear
mother
in
god
used
to
say
to
us
and
i
replied
instead
it
would
be
a
kindness
to
tell
me
if
you
have
anything
to
complain
of
a
tremor
passed
through
him
the
blood
rose
in
his
olive
cheeks
he
replied
in
a
voice
of
some
emotion
religion
must
have
taught
you
better
than
i
can
to
respect
the
unhappy
had
i
been
a
in
spain
and
lost
everything
in
the
triumph
of
ferdinand
your
witticism
would
be
unkind
but
if
i
am
only
a
poor
teacher
of
languages
is
it
not
a
heartless
satire
neither
is
worthy
of
a
young
lady
of
rank
i
took
his
hand
saying
in
the
name
of
religion
also
i
beg
you
to
pardon
me
he
bowed
opened
my
and
sat
down
this
little
incident
disturbed
me
more
than
the
harvest
of
compliments
gazing
and
pretty
speeches
on
my
most
successful
evening
during
the
lesson
i
watched
him
attentively
which
i
could
do
the
more
safely
as
he
never
looks
at
me
as
the
result
of
my
observations
i
made
out
that
the
tutor
whom
we
took
to
be
forty
is
a
young
man
some
years
under
thirty
my
governess
to
whom
i
had
handed
him
over
remarked
on
the
beauty
of
his
black
hair
and
of
his
pearly
teeth
as
to
his
eyes
they
are
velvet
and
fire
but
he
is
plain
and
insignificant
though
the
spaniards
have
been
described
as
not
a
cleanly
people
this
man
is
most
carefully
got
up
and
his
hands
are
whiter
than
his
face
he
stoops
a
little
and
has
an
extremely
large
head
his
ugliness
which
however
has
a
dash
of
piquancy
is
aggravated
by
smallpox
marks
which
seam
his
face
his
forehead
is
very
prominent
and
the
shaggy
eyebrows
meet
giving
a
repellent
air
of
harshness
there
is
a
frowning
plaintive
look
on
his
face
reminding
one
of
a
sickly
child
which
owes
its
life
to
superhuman
care
as
sister
marthe
did
as
my
father
observed
his
features
are
a
shrunken
reproduction
of
those
of
cardinal
ximenes
the
natural
dignity
of
our
tutor
manners
seems
to
disconcert
the
dear
duke
who
like
him
and
is
never
at
ease
with
him
he
ca
bear
to
come
in
contact
with
superiority
of
any
kind
as
soon
as
my
father
knows
enough
spanish
we
start
for
madrid
when
henarez
returned
two
days
after
the
reproof
he
had
given
me
i
remarked
by
way
of
showing
my
gratitude
i
have
no
doubt
that
you
left
spain
in
consequence
of
political
events
if
my
father
is
sent
there
as
seems
to
be
expected
we
shall
be
in
a
position
to
help
you
and
might
be
able
to
obtain
your
pardon
in
case
you
are
under
sentence
it
is
impossible
for
any
one
to
help
me
he
replied
but
i
said
is
that
because
you
refuse
to
accept
any
help
or
because
the
thing
itself
is
impossible
both
he
said
with
a
bow
and
in
a
tone
which
forbade
continuing
the
subject
my
father
blood
chafed
in
my
veins
i
was
offended
by
this
haughty
demeanor
and
promptly
dropped
senor
henarez
all
the
same
my
dear
there
is
something
fine
in
this
rejection
of
any
aid
he
would
not
accept
even
our
friendship
i
reflected
whilst
conjugating
a
verb
suddenly
i
stopped
short
and
told
him
what
was
in
my
mind
but
in
spanish
henarez
replied
very
politely
that
equality
of
sentiment
was
necessary
between
friends
which
did
not
exist
in
this
case
and
therefore
it
was
useless
to
consider
the
question
do
you
mean
equality
in
the
amount
of
feeling
on
either
side
or
equality
in
rank
i
persisted
determined
to
shake
him
out
of
this
provoking
gravity
he
raised
once
more
those
eyes
and
mine
fell
before
them
dear
this
man
is
a
hopeless
enigma
he
seemed
to
ask
whether
my
words
meant
love
and
the
mixture
of
joy
pride
and
agonized
doubt
in
his
glance
went
to
my
heart
it
was
plain
that
advances
which
would
be
taken
for
what
they
were
worth
in
france
might
land
me
in
difficulties
with
a
spaniard
and
i
drew
back
into
my
shell
feeling
not
a
little
foolish
the
lesson
over
he
bowed
and
his
eyes
were
eloquent
of
the
humble
prayer
do
trifle
with
a
poor
wretch
this
sudden
contrast
to
his
usual
grave
and
dignified
manner
made
a
great
impression
on
me
it
seems
horrible
to
think
and
to
say
but
i
ca
help
believing
that
there
are
treasures
of
affection
in
that
man
ix
mme
de
to
mlle
de
chaulieu
december
all
is
over
my
dear
child
and
it
is
mme
de
who
writes
to
you
but
between
us
there
is
no
change
it
is
only
a
girl
the
less
do
be
troubled
i
did
not
give
my
consent
recklessly
or
without
much
thought
my
life
is
henceforth
mapped
out
for
me
and
the
freedom
from
all
uncertainty
as
to
the
road
for
me
to
follow
suits
my
mind
and
disposition
a
great
moral
power
has
stepped
in
and
once
for
all
swept
what
we
call
chance
out
of
my
life
we
have
the
property
to
develop
our
home
to
beautify
and
adorn
for
me
there
is
also
a
household
to
direct
and
sweeten
and
a
husband
to
reconcile
to
life
in
all
probability
i
shall
have
a
family
to
look
after
children
to
educate
what
would
you
have
everyday
life
can
not
be
cast
in
heroic
mould
no
doubt
there
seems
at
any
rate
at
first
sight
no
room
left
in
this
scheme
of
life
for
that
longing
after
the
infinite
which
expands
the
mind
and
soul
but
what
is
there
to
prevent
me
from
launching
on
that
boundless
sea
our
familiar
craft
nor
must
you
suppose
that
the
humble
duties
to
which
i
dedicate
my
life
give
no
scope
for
passion
to
restore
faith
in
happiness
to
an
unfortunate
who
has
been
the
sport
of
adverse
circumstances
is
a
noble
work
and
one
which
alone
may
suffice
to
relieve
the
monotony
of
my
existence
i
can
see
no
opening
left
for
suffering
and
i
see
a
great
deal
of
good
to
be
done
i
need
not
hide
from
you
that
the
love
i
have
for
louis
de
is
not
of
the
kind
which
makes
the
heart
throb
at
the
sound
of
a
step
and
thrills
us
at
the
lightest
tones
of
a
voice
or
the
caress
of
a
burning
glance
but
on
the
other
hand
there
is
nothing
in
him
which
offends
me
what
am
i
to
do
you
will
ask
with
that
instinct
for
all
which
is
great
and
noble
with
those
mental
energies
which
have
made
the
link
between
us
and
which
we
still
possess
i
admit
that
this
thought
has
troubled
me
but
are
these
faculties
less
ours
because
we
keep
them
concealed
using
them
only
in
secret
for
the
welfare
of
the
family
as
instruments
to
produce
the
happiness
of
those
confided
to
our
care
to
whom
we
are
bound
to
give
ourselves
without
reserve
the
time
during
which
a
woman
can
look
for
admiration
is
short
it
will
soon
be
past
and
if
my
life
has
not
been
a
great
one
it
will
at
least
have
been
calm
tranquil
free
from
shocks
nature
has
favored
our
sex
in
giving
us
a
choice
between
love
and
motherhood
i
have
made
mine
my
children
shall
be
my
gods
and
this
spot
of
earth
my
eldorado
i
can
say
no
more
thank
you
much
for
all
the
things
you
have
sent
me
give
a
glance
at
my
needs
on
the
enclosed
list
i
am
determined
to
live
in
an
atmosphere
of
refinement
and
luxury
and
to
take
from
provincial
life
only
what
makes
its
charm
in
solitude
a
woman
can
never
be
vulgarized
she
remains
herself
i
count
greatly
on
your
kindness
for
keeping
me
up
to
the
fashion
my
is
so
delighted
that
he
can
refuse
me
nothing
and
turns
his
house
upside
down
we
are
getting
workpeople
from
paris
and
renovating
everything
mlle
de
chaulieu
to
mme
de
january
oh
renee
you
have
made
me
miserable
for
days
so
that
bewitching
body
those
beautiful
proud
features
that
natural
grace
of
manner
that
soul
full
of
priceless
gifts
those
eyes
where
the
soul
can
slake
its
thirst
as
at
a
fountain
of
love
that
heart
with
its
exquisite
delicacy
that
breadth
of
mind
those
rare
powers
fruit
of
nature
and
of
our
interchange
of
thought
treasures
whence
should
issue
a
unique
satisfaction
for
passion
and
desire
hours
of
poetry
to
outweigh
years
joys
to
make
a
man
serve
a
lifetime
for
one
gracious
gesture
all
this
is
to
be
buried
in
the
tedium
of
a
tame
commonplace
marriage
to
vanish
in
the
emptiness
of
an
existence
which
you
will
come
to
loath
i
hate
your
children
before
they
are
born
they
will
be
monsters
so
you
know
all
that
lies
before
you
you
have
nothing
left
to
hope
or
fear
or
suffer
and
supposing
the
glorious
morning
rises
which
will
bring
you
face
to
face
with
the
man
destined
to
rouse
you
from
the
sleep
into
which
you
are
plunging
ah
a
cold
shiver
goes
through
me
at
the
thought
well
at
least
you
have
a
friend
you
it
is
understood
are
to
be
the
guardian
angel
of
your
valley
you
will
grow
familiar
with
its
beauties
will
live
with
it
in
all
its
aspects
till
the
grandeur
of
nature
the
slow
growth
of
vegetation
compared
with
the
lightning
rapidity
of
thought
become
like
a
part
of
yourself
and
as
your
eye
rests
on
the
laughing
flowers
you
will
question
your
own
heart
when
you
walk
between
your
husband
silent
and
contented
in
front
and
your
children
screaming
and
romping
behind
i
can
tell
you
beforehand
what
you
will
write
to
me
your
misty
valley
your
hills
bare
or
clothed
with
magnificent
trees
your
meadow
the
wonder
of
provence
with
its
fresh
water
dispersed
in
little
runlets
the
different
effects
of
the
atmosphere
this
whole
world
of
infinity
which
laps
you
round
and
which
god
has
made
so
various
will
recall
to
you
the
infinite
sameness
of
your
soul
life
but
at
least
i
shall
be
there
my
renee
and
in
me
you
will
find
a
heart
which
no
social
pettiness
shall
ever
corrupt
a
heart
all
your
own
monday
my
dear
my
spaniard
is
quite
adorably
melancholy
there
is
something
calm
severe
manly
and
mysterious
about
him
which
interests
me
profoundly
his
unvarying
solemnity
and
the
silence
which
envelops
him
act
like
an
irritant
on
the
mind
his
mute
dignity
is
worthy
of
a
fallen
king
griffith
and
i
spend
our
time
over
him
as
though
he
were
a
riddle
how
odd
it
is
a
captures
my
fancy
as
no
other
man
has
done
yet
by
this
time
i
have
passed
in
review
all
the
young
men
of
family
the
attaches
to
embassies
and
the
ambassadors
generals
and
inferior
officers
the
peers
of
france
their
sons
and
nephews
the
court
and
the
town
the
coldness
of
the
man
provokes
me
the
sandy
waste
which
he
tries
to
place
and
does
place
between
us
is
covered
by
his
deeprooted
pride
he
wraps
himself
in
mystery
the
hanging
back
is
on
his
side
the
boldness
on
mine
this
odd
situation
affords
me
the
more
amusement
because
the
whole
thing
is
mere
trifling
what
is
a
man
a
spaniard
and
a
teacher
of
languages
to
me
i
make
no
account
of
any
man
whatever
were
he
a
king
we
are
worth
far
more
i
am
sure
than
the
greatest
of
them
what
a
slave
i
would
have
made
of
napoleon
if
he
had
loved
me
should
he
have
felt
the
whip
yesterday
i
aimed
a
shaft
at
henarez
which
must
have
touched
him
to
the
quick
he
made
no
reply
the
lesson
was
over
and
he
bowed
with
a
glance
at
me
in
which
i
read
that
he
would
never
return
this
suits
me
capitally
there
would
be
something
ominous
in
starting
an
imitation
i
have
just
been
reading
rousseau
and
it
has
left
me
with
a
strong
distaste
for
love
passion
which
can
argue
and
moralize
seems
to
me
detestable
clarissa
also
is
much
too
pleased
with
herself
and
her
long
little
letter
but
richardson
work
is
an
admirable
picture
my
father
tells
me
of
english
women
rousseau
seems
to
me
a
sort
of
philosophical
sermon
cast
in
the
form
of
letters
love
as
i
conceive
it
is
a
purely
subjective
poem
in
all
that
books
tell
us
about
it
there
is
nothing
which
is
not
at
once
false
and
true
and
so
my
pretty
one
as
you
will
henceforth
be
an
authority
only
on
conjugal
love
it
seems
to
me
my
duty
in
the
interest
of
course
of
our
common
life
to
remain
unmarried
and
have
a
grand
passion
so
that
we
may
enlarge
our
experience
tell
me
every
detail
of
what
happens
to
you
especially
in
the
first
few
days
with
that
strange
animal
called
a
husband
i
promise
to
do
the
same
for
you
if
ever
i
am
loved
farewell
poor
martyred
darling
xi
mme
de
to
mlle
de
chaulieu
la
crampade
your
spaniard
and
you
make
me
shudder
my
darling
i
write
this
line
to
beg
of
you
to
dismiss
him
all
that
you
say
of
him
corresponds
with
the
character
of
those
dangerous
adventurers
who
having
nothing
to
lose
will
take
any
risk
this
man
can
not
be
your
husband
and
must
not
be
your
lover
i
will
write
to
you
more
fully
about
the
inner
history
of
my
married
life
when
my
heart
is
free
from
the
anxiety
your
last
letter
has
roused
in
it
xii
mlle
de
chaulieu
to
mme
de
february
at
nine
this
morning
sweetheart
my
father
was
announced
in
my
rooms
i
was
up
and
dressed
i
found
him
solemnly
seated
beside
the
fire
in
the
looking
more
thoughtful
than
usual
he
pointed
to
the
armchair
opposite
to
him
divining
his
meaning
i
sank
into
it
with
a
gravity
which
so
well
aped
his
that
he
could
not
refrain
from
smiling
though
the
smile
was
dashed
with
melancholy
you
are
quite
a
match
for
your
grandmother
in
he
said
come
father
do
play
the
courtier
here
i
replied
you
want
something
from
me
he
rose
visibly
agitated
and
talked
to
me
for
half
an
hour
this
conversation
dear
really
ought
to
be
preserved
as
soon
as
he
had
gone
i
sat
down
to
my
table
and
tried
to
recall
his
words
this
is
the
first
time
that
i
have
seen
my
father
revealing
his
inner
thoughts
he
began
by
flattering
me
and
he
did
not
do
it
badly
i
was
bound
to
be
grateful
to
him
for
having
understood
and
appreciated
me
armande
he
said
i
was
quite
mistaken
in
you
and
you
have
agreeably
surprised
me
when
you
arrived
from
the
convent
i
took
you
for
an
average
young
girl
ignorant
and
not
particularly
intelligent
easily
to
be
bought
off
with
gewgaws
and
ornaments
and
with
little
turn
for
reflection
you
are
complimentary
to
young
girls
father
oh
there
is
no
such
thing
as
youth
nowadays
he
said
with
the
air
of
a
diplomat
your
mind
is
amazingly
open
you
take
everything
at
its
proper
worth
your
is
extraordinary
there
is
no
hoodwinking
you
you
pass
for
being
blind
and
all
the
time
you
have
laid
your
hand
on
causes
while
other
people
are
still
puzzling
over
effects
in
short
you
are
a
minister
in
petticoats
the
only
person
here
capable
of
understanding
me
it
follows
then
that
if
i
have
any
sacrifice
to
ask
from
you
it
is
only
to
yourself
i
can
turn
for
help
in
persuading
you
i
am
therefore
going
to
explain
to
you
quite
frankly
my
former
plans
to
which
i
still
adhere
in
order
to
recommend
them
to
you
i
must
show
that
they
are
connected
with
feelings
of
a
very
high
order
and
i
shall
thus
be
obliged
to
enter
into
political
questions
of
the
greatest
importance
to
the
kingdom
which
might
be
wearisome
to
any
one
less
intelligent
than
you
are
when
you
have
heard
me
i
hope
you
will
take
time
for
consideration
six
months
if
necessary
you
are
entirely
your
own
mistress
and
if
you
decline
to
make
the
sacrifice
i
ask
i
shall
bow
to
your
decision
and
trouble
you
no
further
this
preface
my
sweetheart
made
me
really
serious
and
i
said
speak
father
here
then
is
the
deliverance
of
the
statesman
my
child
france
is
in
a
very
critical
position
which
is
understood
only
by
the
king
and
a
few
superior
minds
but
the
king
is
a
head
without
arms
the
great
nobles
who
are
in
the
secret
of
the
danger
have
no
authority
over
the
men
whose
is
needful
in
order
to
bring
about
a
happy
result
these
men
cast
up
by
popular
election
refuse
to
lend
themselves
as
instruments
even
the
able
men
among
them
carry
on
the
work
of
pulling
down
society
instead
of
helping
us
to
strengthen
the
edifice
in
a
word
there
are
only
two
parties
the
party
of
marius
and
the
party
of
sulla
i
am
for
sulla
against
marius
this
roughly
speaking
is
our
position
to
go
more
into
details
the
revolution
is
still
active
it
is
embedded
in
the
law
and
written
on
the
soil
it
fills
people
minds
the
danger
is
all
the
greater
because
the
greater
number
of
the
king
counselors
seeing
it
destitute
of
armed
forces
and
of
money
believe
it
completely
vanquished
the
king
is
an
able
man
and
not
easily
blinded
but
from
day
to
day
he
is
won
over
by
his
partisans
who
want
to
hurry
things
on
he
has
not
two
years
to
live
and
thinks
more
of
a
peaceful
deathbed
than
of
anything
else
shall
i
tell
you
my
child
which
is
the
most
destructive
of
all
the
consequences
entailed
by
the
revolution
you
would
never
guess
in
louis
xvi
the
revolution
has
decapitated
every
head
of
a
family
the
family
has
ceased
to
exist
we
have
only
individuals
in
their
desire
to
become
a
nation
frenchmen
have
abandoned
the
idea
of
empire
in
proclaiming
the
equal
rights
of
all
children
to
their
father
inheritance
they
have
killed
the
family
spirit
and
created
the
state
treasury
but
all
this
has
paved
the
way
for
weakened
authority
for
the
blind
force
of
the
masses
for
the
decay
of
art
and
the
supremacy
of
individual
interests
and
has
left
the
road
open
to
the
foreign
invader
we
stand
between
two
policies
either
to
found
the
state
on
the
basis
of
the
family
or
to
rest
it
on
individual
interest
in
other
words
between
democracy
and
aristocracy
between
free
discussion
and
obedience
between
catholicism
and
religious
indifference
i
am
among
the
few
who
are
resolved
to
oppose
what
is
called
the
people
and
that
in
the
people
true
interest
it
is
not
now
a
question
of
feudal
rights
as
fools
are
told
nor
of
rank
it
is
a
question
of
the
state
and
of
the
existence
of
france
the
country
which
does
not
rest
on
the
foundation
of
paternal
authority
can
not
be
stable
that
is
the
foot
of
the
ladder
of
responsibility
and
subordination
which
has
for
its
summit
the
king
the
king
stands
for
us
all
to
die
for
the
king
is
to
die
for
oneself
for
one
family
which
like
the
kingdom
can
not
die
all
animals
have
certain
instincts
the
instinct
of
man
is
for
family
life
a
country
is
strong
which
consists
of
wealthy
families
every
member
of
whom
is
interested
in
defending
a
common
treasure
it
is
weak
when
composed
of
scattered
individuals
to
whom
it
matters
little
whether
they
obey
seven
or
one
a
russian
or
a
corsican
so
long
as
each
keeps
his
own
plot
of
land
blind
in
their
wretched
egotism
to
the
fact
that
the
day
is
coming
when
this
too
will
be
torn
from
them
terrible
calamities
are
in
store
for
us
in
case
our
party
fails
nothing
will
be
left
but
penal
or
fiscal
laws
your
money
or
your
life
the
most
generous
nation
on
the
earth
will
have
ceased
to
obey
the
call
of
noble
instincts
wounds
past
curing
will
have
been
fostered
and
aggravated
an
all
pervading
jealousy
being
the
first
then
the
upper
classes
will
be
submerged
equality
of
desire
will
be
taken
for
equality
of
strength
true
distinction
even
when
proved
and
recognized
will
be
threatened
by
the
advancing
tide
of
prejudice
it
was
possible
to
choose
one
man
out
of
a
thousand
but
amongst
three
millions
discrimination
becomes
impossible
when
all
are
moved
by
the
same
ambitions
and
attired
in
the
same
livery
of
mediocrity
no
foresight
will
warn
this
victorious
horde
of
that
other
terrible
horde
soon
to
be
arrayed
against
them
in
the
peasant
proprietors
in
other
words
twenty
million
acres
of
land
alive
stirring
arguing
deaf
to
reason
insatiable
of
appetite
obstructing
progress
masters
in
their
brute
force
but
said
i
interrupting
my
father
what
can
i
do
to
help
the
state
i
feel
no
vocation
for
playing
joan
of
arc
in
the
interests
of
the
family
or
for
finding
a
martyr
block
in
the
convent
you
are
a
little
hussy
cried
my
father
if
i
speak
sensibly
to
you
you
are
full
of
jokes
when
i
jest
you
talk
like
an
ambassadress
love
lives
on
contrasts
was
my
reply
and
he
laughed
till
the
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
you
will
reflect
on
what
i
have
told
you
you
will
do
justice
to
the
large
and
confiding
spirit
in
which
i
have
broached
the
matter
and
possibly
events
may
assist
my
plans
i
know
that
so
far
as
you
are
concerned
they
are
injurious
and
unfair
and
this
is
the
reason
why
i
appeal
for
your
sanction
of
them
less
to
your
heart
and
your
imagination
than
to
your
reason
i
have
found
more
judgment
and
commonsense
in
you
than
in
any
one
i
know
you
flatter
yourself
i
said
with
a
smile
for
i
am
every
inch
your
child
in
short
he
went
on
one
must
be
logical
you
ca
have
the
end
without
the
means
and
it
is
our
duty
to
set
an
example
to
others
from
all
this
i
deduce
that
you
ought
not
to
have
money
of
your
own
till
your
younger
brother
is
provided
for
and
i
want
to
employ
the
whole
of
your
inheritance
in
purchasing
an
estate
for
him
to
go
with
the
title
but
i
said
you
wo
interfere
with
my
living
in
my
own
fashion
and
enjoying
life
if
i
leave
you
my
fortune
provided
he
replied
that
your
view
of
life
does
not
conflict
with
the
family
honor
reputation
and
i
may
add
glory
come
come
i
cried
what
has
become
of
my
excellent
judgment
there
is
not
in
all
france
he
said
with
bitterness
a
man
who
would
take
for
wife
a
daughter
of
one
of
our
noblest
families
without
a
dowry
and
bestow
one
on
her
if
such
a
husband
could
be
found
it
would
be
among
the
class
of
rich
on
this
point
i
belong
to
the
eleventh
century
and
i
also
i
said
but
why
despair
are
there
no
aged
peers
you
are
an
apt
scholar
louise
he
exclaimed
then
he
left
me
smiling
and
kissing
my
hand
i
received
your
letter
this
very
morning
and
it
led
me
to
contemplate
that
abyss
into
which
you
say
that
i
may
fall
a
voice
within
seemed
to
utter
the
same
warning
so
i
took
my
precautions
henarez
my
dear
dares
to
look
at
me
and
his
eyes
are
disquieting
they
inspire
me
with
what
i
can
only
call
an
unreasoning
dread
such
a
man
ought
no
more
to
be
looked
at
than
a
frog
he
is
ugly
and
fascinating
for
two
days
i
have
been
hesitating
whether
to
tell
my
father
that
i
want
no
more
spanish
lessons
and
have
henarez
sent
about
his
business
but
in
spite
of
all
my
brave
resolutions
i
feel
that
the
horrible
sensation
which
comes
over
me
when
i
see
that
man
has
become
necessary
to
me
i
say
to
myself
once
more
and
then
i
will
speak
his
voice
my
dear
is
sweetly
thrilling
his
speaking
is
just
like
la
fodor
singing
his
manners
are
simple
entirely
free
from
affectation
and
what
teeth
just
now
as
he
was
leaving
he
seemed
to
divine
the
interest
i
take
in
him
and
made
a
gesture
oh
most
respectfully
as
though
to
take
my
hand
and
kiss
it
then
checked
himself
apparently
terrified
at
his
own
boldness
and
the
chasm
he
had
been
on
the
point
of
bridging
there
was
the
merest
suggestion
of
all
this
but
i
understood
it
and
smiled
for
nothing
is
more
pathetic
than
to
see
the
frank
impulse
of
an
inferior
checking
itself
abashed
the
love
of
a
plebeian
for
a
girl
of
noble
birth
implies
such
courage
my
smile
emboldened
him
the
poor
fellow
looked
blindly
about
for
his
hat
he
seemed
determined
not
to
find
it
and
i
handed
it
to
him
with
perfect
gravity
his
eyes
were
wet
with
unshed
tears
it
was
a
mere
passing
moment
yet
a
world
of
facts
and
ideas
were
contained
in
it
we
understood
each
other
so
well
that
on
a
sudden
i
held
out
my
hand
for
him
to
kiss
possibly
this
was
equivalent
to
telling
him
that
love
might
bridge
the
interval
between
us
well
i
can
not
tell
what
moved
me
to
do
it
griffith
had
her
back
turned
as
i
proudly
extended
my
little
white
paw
i
felt
the
fire
of
his
lips
tempered
by
two
big
tears
oh
my
love
i
lay
in
my
armchair
nerveless
dreamy
i
was
happy
and
i
can
not
explain
to
you
how
or
why
what
i
felt
only
a
poet
could
express
my
condescension
which
fills
me
with
shame
now
seemed
to
me
then
something
to
be
proud
of
he
had
fascinated
me
that
is
my
one
excuse
friday
this
man
is
really
very
handsome
he
talks
admirably
and
has
remarkable
intellectual
power
my
dear
he
is
a
very
bossuet
in
force
and
persuasiveness
when
he
explains
the
mechanism
not
only
of
the
spanish
tongue
but
also
of
human
thought
and
of
all
language
his
mother
tongue
seems
to
be
french
when
i
expressed
surprise
at
this
he
replied
that
he
came
to
france
when
quite
a
boy
following
the
king
of
spain
to
valencay
what
has
passed
within
this
enigmatic
being
he
is
no
longer
the
same
man
he
came
dressed
quite
simply
but
just
as
any
gentleman
would
for
a
morning
walk
he
put
forth
all
his
eloquence
and
flashed
wit
like
rays
from
a
beacon
all
through
the
lesson
like
a
man
roused
from
lethargy
he
revealed
to
me
a
new
world
of
thoughts
he
told
me
the
story
of
some
poor
devil
of
a
valet
who
gave
up
his
life
for
a
single
glance
from
a
queen
of
spain
what
could
he
do
but
die
i
exclaimed
this
delighted
him
and
he
looked
at
me
in
a
way
which
was
truly
alarming
in
the
evening
i
went
to
a
ball
at
the
duchesse
de
lenoncourt
the
prince
de
talleyrand
happened
to
be
there
and
i
got
de
vandenesse
a
charming
young
man
to
ask
him
whether
among
the
guests
at
his
in
he
remembered
any
one
of
the
name
of
henarez
vandenesse
reported
the
prince
reply
word
for
word
as
follows
henarez
is
the
moorish
name
of
the
soria
family
who
are
they
say
descendants
of
the
abencerrages
converted
to
christianity
the
old
duke
and
his
two
sons
were
with
the
king
the
eldest
the
present
duke
de
soria
has
just
had
all
his
property
titles
and
dignities
confiscated
by
king
ferdinand
who
in
this
way
avenges
a
feud
the
duke
made
a
huge
mistake
in
consenting
to
form
a
constitutional
ministry
with
valdez
happily
he
escaped
from
cadiz
before
the
arrival
of
the
duc
who
with
the
best
will
in
the
world
could
not
have
saved
him
from
the
king
wrath
this
information
gave
me
much
food
for
reflection
i
can
not
describe
to
you
the
suspense
in
which
i
passed
the
time
till
my
next
lesson
which
took
place
this
morning
during
the
first
quarter
of
an
hour
i
examined
him
closely
debating
inwardly
whether
he
were
duke
or
commoner
without
being
able
to
come
to
any
conclusion
he
seemed
to
read
my
fancies
as
they
arose
and
to
take
pleasure
in
thwarting
them
at
last
i
could
endure
it
no
longer
putting
down
my
book
suddenly
i
broke
off
the
translation
i
was
making
of
it
aloud
and
said
to
him
in
spanish
you
are
deceiving
us
you
are
no
poor
liberal
you
are
the
duke
de
soria
mademoiselle
he
replied
with
a
gesture
of
sorrow
unhappily
i
am
not
the
duc
de
soria
i
felt
all
the
despair
with
which
he
uttered
the
word
unhappily
ah
my
dear
never
should
i
have
conceived
it
possible
to
throw
so
much
meaning
and
passion
into
a
single
word
his
eyes
had
dropped
and
he
dared
no
longer
look
at
me
de
talleyrand
i
said
in
whose
house
you
spent
your
years
of
exile
declares
that
any
one
bearing
the
name
of
henarez
must
either
be
the
late
duc
de
soria
or
a
lacquey
he
looked
at
me
with
eyes
like
two
black
burning
coals
at
once
blazing
and
ashamed
the
man
might
have
been
in
the
all
he
said
was
my
father
was
in
truth
the
servant
of
the
king
of
spain
griffith
could
make
nothing
of
this
sort
of
lesson
an
awkward
silence
followed
each
question
and
answer
in
one
word
i
said
are
you
a
nobleman
or
not
you
know
that
in
spain
even
beggars
are
noble
this
reticence
provoked
me
since
the
last
lesson
i
had
given
play
to
my
imagination
in
a
little
practical
joke
i
had
drawn
an
ideal
portrait
of
the
man
whom
i
should
wish
for
my
lover
in
a
letter
which
i
designed
giving
to
him
to
translate
so
far
i
had
only
put
spanish
into
french
not
french
into
spanish
i
pointed
this
out
to
him
and
begged
griffith
to
bring
me
the
last
letter
i
had
received
from
a
friend
of
mine
i
shall
find
out
i
thought
from
the
effect
my
sketch
has
on
him
what
sort
of
blood
runs
in
his
veins
i
took
the
paper
from
griffith
hands
saying
let
me
see
if
i
have
copied
it
rightly
for
it
was
all
in
my
writing
i
handed
him
the
paper
or
if
you
will
the
snare
and
i
watched
him
while
he
read
as
follows
he
who
is
to
win
my
heart
my
dear
must
be
harsh
and
unbending
with
men
but
gentle
with
women
his
eagle
eye
must
have
power
to
quell
with
a
single
glance
the
least
approach
to
ridicule
he
will
have
a
pitying
smile
for
those
who
would
jeer
at
sacred
things
above
all
at
that
poetry
of
the
heart
without
which
life
would
be
but
a
dreary
commonplace
i
have
the
greatest
scorn
for
those
who
would
rob
us
of
the
living
fountain
of
religious
beliefs
so
rich
in
solace
his
faith
therefore
should
have
the
simplicity
of
a
child
though
united
to
the
firm
conviction
of
an
intelligent
man
who
has
examined
the
foundations
of
his
creed
his
fresh
and
original
way
of
looking
at
things
must
be
entirely
free
from
affectation
or
desire
to
show
off
his
words
will
be
few
and
fit
and
his
mind
so
richly
stored
that
he
can
not
possibly
become
a
bore
to
himself
any
more
than
to
others
all
his
thoughts
must
have
a
high
and
chivalrous
character
without
alloy
of
while
his
actions
should
be
marked
by
a
total
absence
of
interested
or
sordid
motives
any
weak
points
he
may
have
will
arise
from
the
very
elevation
of
his
views
above
those
of
the
common
herd
for
in
every
respect
i
would
have
him
superior
to
his
age
ever
mindful
of
the
delicate
attentions
due
to
the
weak
he
will
be
gentle
to
all
women
but
not
prone
lightly
to
fall
in
love
with
any
for
love
will
seem
to
him
too
serious
to
turn
into
a
game
thus
it
might
happen
that
he
would
spend
his
life
in
ignorance
of
true
love
while
all
the
time
possessing
those
qualities
most
fitted
to
inspire
it
but
if
ever
he
find
the
ideal
woman
who
has
haunted
his
waking
dreams
if
he
meet
with
a
nature
capable
of
understanding
his
own
one
who
could
fill
his
soul
and
pour
sunlight
over
his
life
could
shine
as
a
star
through
the
mists
of
this
chill
and
gloomy
world
lend
fresh
charm
to
existence
and
draw
music
from
the
hitherto
silent
chords
of
his
being
needless
to
say
he
would
recognize
and
welcome
his
good
fortune
and
she
too
would
be
happy
never
by
word
or
look
would
he
wound
the
tender
heart
which
abandoned
itself
to
him
with
the
blind
trust
of
a
child
reposing
in
its
mother
arms
for
were
the
vision
shattered
it
would
be
the
wreck
of
her
inner
life
to
the
mighty
waters
of
love
she
would
confide
her
all
the
man
i
picture
must
belong
in
expression
in
attitude
in
gait
in
his
way
of
performing
alike
the
smallest
and
the
greatest
actions
to
that
race
of
the
truly
great
who
are
always
simple
and
natural
he
need
not
be
but
his
hands
must
be
beautiful
his
upper
lip
will
curl
with
a
careless
ironic
smile
for
the
general
public
whilst
he
reserves
for
those
he
loves
the
heavenly
radiant
glance
in
which
he
puts
his
soul
will
mademoiselle
allow
me
he
said
in
spanish
in
a
voice
full
of
agitation
to
keep
this
writing
in
memory
of
her
this
is
the
last
lesson
i
shall
have
the
honor
of
giving
her
and
that
which
i
have
just
received
in
these
words
may
serve
me
for
an
abiding
rule
of
life
i
left
spain
a
fugitive
and
penniless
but
i
have
received
from
my
family
a
sum
sufficient
for
my
needs
you
will
allow
me
to
send
some
poor
spaniard
in
my
place
in
other
words
he
seemed
to
me
to
say
this
little
game
must
stop
he
rose
with
an
air
of
marvelous
dignity
and
left
me
quite
upset
by
such
delicacy
in
a
man
of
his
class
he
went
downstairs
and
asked
to
speak
with
my
father
at
dinner
my
father
said
to
me
with
a
smile
louise
you
have
been
learning
spanish
from
an
and
a
man
condemned
to
death
the
duc
de
soria
i
said
duke
replied
my
father
no
he
is
not
that
any
longer
he
takes
the
title
now
of
baron
de
macumer
from
a
property
which
still
remains
to
him
in
sardinia
he
is
something
of
an
original
i
think
do
brand
with
that
word
which
with
you
always
implies
some
mockery
and
scorn
a
man
who
is
your
equal
and
who
i
believe
has
a
noble
nature
baronne
de
macumer
exclaimed
my
father
with
a
laughing
glance
at
me
pride
kept
my
eyes
fixed
on
the
table
but
said
my
mother
henarez
must
have
met
the
spanish
ambassador
on
the
steps
yes
replied
my
father
the
ambassador
asked
me
if
i
was
conspiring
against
the
king
his
master
but
he
greeted
the
of
spain
with
much
deference
and
placed
his
services
at
his
disposal
all
this
dear
mme
de
happened
a
fortnight
ago
and
it
is
a
fortnight
now
since
i
have
seen
the
man
who
loves
me
for
that
he
loves
me
there
is
not
a
doubt
what
is
he
about
if
only
i
were
a
fly
or
a
mouse
or
a
sparrow
i
want
to
see
him
alone
myself
unseen
at
his
house
only
think
a
man
exists
to
whom
i
can
say
go
and
die
for
me
and
he
is
so
made
that
he
would
go
at
least
i
think
so
anyhow
there
is
in
paris
a
man
who
occupies
my
thoughts
and
whose
glance
pours
sunshine
into
my
soul
is
not
such
a
man
an
enemy
whom
i
ought
to
trample
under
foot
what
there
is
a
man
who
has
become
necessary
to
me
a
man
without
whom
i
do
know
how
to
live
you
married
and
i
in
love
four
little
months
and
those
two
doves
whose
wings
erst
bore
them
so
high
have
fluttered
down
upon
the
flat
stretches
of
real
life
sunday
yesterday
at
the
italian
opera
i
could
feel
some
one
was
looking
at
me
my
eyes
were
drawn
as
by
a
magnet
to
two
wells
of
fire
gleaming
like
carbuncles
in
a
dim
corner
of
the
orchestra
henarez
never
moved
his
eyes
from
me
the
wretch
had
discovered
the
one
spot
from
which
he
could
see
me
and
there
he
was
i
do
know
what
he
may
be
as
a
politician
but
for
love
he
has
a
genius
behold
my
fair
renee
where
our
business
now
stands
as
the
great
corneille
has
said
xiii
mme
de
to
mlle
de
chaulieu
la
crampade
february
my
dear
louise
i
was
bound
to
wait
some
time
before
writing
to
you
but
now
i
know
or
rather
i
have
learned
many
things
which
for
the
sake
of
your
future
happiness
i
must
tell
you
the
difference
between
a
girl
and
a
married
woman
is
so
vast
that
the
girl
can
no
more
comprehend
it
than
the
married
woman
can
go
back
to
girlhood
again
i
chose
to
marry
louis
de
rather
than
return
to
the
convent
that
at
least
is
plain
so
soon
as
i
realized
that
the
convent
was
the
only
alternative
to
marrying
louis
i
had
as
girls
say
to
submit
and
my
submission
once
made
the
next
thing
was
to
examine
the
situation
and
try
to
make
the
best
of
it
the
serious
nature
of
what
i
was
undertaking
filled
me
at
first
with
terror
marriage
is
a
matter
concerning
the
whole
of
life
whilst
love
aims
only
at
pleasure
on
the
other
hand
marriage
will
remain
when
pleasures
have
vanished
and
it
is
the
source
of
interests
far
more
precious
than
those
of
the
man
and
woman
entering
on
the
alliance
might
it
not
therefore
be
that
the
only
requisite
for
a
happy
marriage
was
friendship
a
friendship
which
for
the
sake
of
these
advantages
would
shut
its
eyes
to
many
of
the
imperfections
of
humanity
now
there
was
no
obstacle
to
the
existence
of
friendship
between
myself
and
louis
de
having
renounced
all
idea
of
finding
in
marriage
those
transports
of
love
on
which
our
minds
used
so
often
and
with
such
perilous
rapture
to
dwell
i
found
a
gentle
calm
settling
over
me
if
debarred
from
love
why
not
seek
for
happiness
i
said
to
myself
moreover
i
am
loved
and
the
love
offered
me
i
shall
accept
my
married
life
will
be
no
slavery
but
rather
a
perpetual
reign
what
is
there
to
say
against
such
a
situation
for
a
woman
who
wishes
to
remain
absolute
mistress
of
herself
the
important
point
of
separating
marriage
from
marital
rights
was
settled
in
a
conversation
between
louis
and
me
in
the
course
of
which
he
gave
proof
of
an
excellent
temper
and
a
tender
heart
darling
my
desire
was
to
prolong
that
fair
season
of
hope
which
never
culminating
in
satisfaction
leaves
to
the
soul
its
virginity
to
grant
nothing
to
duty
or
the
law
to
be
guided
entirely
by
one
own
will
retaining
perfect
independence
what
could
be
more
attractive
more
honorable
a
contract
of
this
kind
directly
opposed
to
the
legal
contract
and
even
to
the
sacrament
itself
could
be
concluded
only
between
louis
and
me
this
difficulty
the
first
which
has
arisen
is
the
only
one
which
has
delayed
the
completion
of
our
marriage
although
at
first
i
may
have
made
up
my
mind
to
accept
anything
rather
than
return
to
the
convent
it
is
only
in
human
nature
having
got
an
inch
to
ask
for
an
ell
and
you
and
i
sweet
love
are
of
those
who
would
have
it
all
i
watched
louis
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
and
put
it
to
myself
has
suffering
had
a
softening
or
a
hardening
effect
on
him
by
dint
of
close
study
i
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
his
love
amounted
to
a
passion
once
transformed
into
an
idol
whose
slightest
frown
would
turn
him
white
and
trembling
i
realized
that
i
might
venture
anything
i
drew
him
aside
in
the
most
natural
manner
on
solitary
walks
during
which
i
discreetly
sounded
his
feelings
i
made
him
talk
and
got
him
to
expound
to
me
his
ideas
and
plans
for
our
future
my
questions
betrayed
so
many
preconceived
notions
and
went
so
straight
for
the
weak
points
in
this
terrible
dual
existence
that
louis
has
since
confessed
to
me
the
alarm
it
caused
him
to
find
in
me
so
little
of
the
ignorant
maiden
then
i
listened
to
what
he
had
to
say
in
reply
he
got
mixed
up
in
his
arguments
as
people
do
when
handicapped
by
fear
and
before
long
it
became
clear
that
chance
had
given
me
for
adversary
one
who
was
the
less
fitted
for
the
contest
because
he
was
conscious
of
what
you
magniloquently
call
my
greatness
of
soul
broken
by
sufferings
and
misfortune
he
looked
on
himself
as
a
sort
of
wreck
and
three
fears
in
especial
haunted
him
first
we
are
aged
respectively
and
seventeen
and
he
could
not
contemplate
without
quaking
the
twenty
years
that
divide
us
in
the
next
place
he
shares
our
views
on
the
subject
of
my
beauty
and
it
is
cruel
for
him
to
see
how
the
hardships
of
his
life
have
robbed
him
of
youth
finally
he
felt
the
superiority
of
my
womanhood
over
his
manhood
the
consciousness
of
these
three
obvious
drawbacks
made
him
distrustful
of
himself
he
doubted
his
power
to
make
me
happy
and
guessed
that
he
had
been
chosen
as
the
lesser
of
two
evils
one
evening
he
tentatively
suggested
that
i
only
married
him
to
escape
the
convent
i
can
not
deny
it
was
my
grave
reply
my
dear
it
touched
me
to
the
heart
to
see
the
two
great
tears
which
stood
in
his
eyes
never
before
had
i
experienced
the
shock
of
emotion
which
a
man
can
impart
to
us
louis
i
went
on
as
kindly
as
i
could
it
rests
entirely
with
you
whether
this
marriage
of
convenience
becomes
one
to
which
i
can
give
my
whole
heart
the
favor
i
am
about
to
ask
from
you
will
demand
unselfishness
on
your
part
far
nobler
than
the
servitude
to
which
a
man
love
when
sincere
is
supposed
to
reduce
him
the
question
is
can
you
rise
to
the
height
of
friendship
such
as
i
understand
it
life
gives
us
but
one
friend
and
i
wish
to
be
yours
friendship
is
the
bond
between
a
pair
of
kindred
souls
united
in
their
strength
and
yet
independent
let
us
be
friends
and
comrades
to
bear
jointly
the
burden
of
life
leave
me
absolutely
free
i
would
put
no
hindrance
in
the
way
of
your
inspiring
me
with
a
love
similar
to
your
own
but
i
am
determined
to
be
yours
only
of
my
own
free
gift
create
in
me
the
wish
to
give
up
my
freedom
and
at
once
i
lay
it
at
your
feet
infuse
with
passion
then
if
you
will
this
friendship
and
let
the
voice
of
love
disturb
its
calm
on
my
part
i
will
do
what
i
can
to
bring
my
feelings
into
accord
with
yours
one
thing
above
all
i
would
beg
of
you
spare
me
the
annoyances
to
which
the
strangeness
of
our
mutual
position
might
give
rise
to
our
relations
with
others
i
am
neither
whimsical
nor
prudish
and
should
be
sorry
to
get
that
reputation
but
i
feel
sure
that
i
can
trust
to
your
honor
when
i
ask
you
to
keep
up
the
outward
appearance
of
wedded
life
never
dear
have
i
seen
a
man
so
happy
as
my
proposal
made
louis
the
blaze
of
joy
which
kindled
in
his
eyes
dried
up
the
tears
do
not
fancy
i
concluded
that
i
ask
this
from
any
wish
to
be
eccentric
it
is
the
great
desire
i
have
for
your
respect
which
prompts
my
request
if
you
owe
the
crown
of
your
love
merely
to
the
legal
and
religious
ceremony
what
gratitude
could
you
feel
to
me
later
for
a
gift
in
which
my
goodwill
counted
for
nothing
if
during
the
time
that
i
remained
indifferent
to
you
yielding
only
a
passive
obedience
such
as
my
mother
has
just
been
urging
on
me
a
child
were
born
to
us
do
you
suppose
that
i
could
feel
towards
it
as
i
would
towards
one
born
of
our
common
love
a
passionate
love
may
not
be
necessary
in
marriage
but
at
least
you
will
admit
that
there
should
be
no
repugnance
our
position
will
not
be
without
its
dangers
in
a
country
life
such
as
ours
will
be
ought
we
not
to
bear
in
mind
the
evanescent
nature
of
passion
is
it
not
simple
prudence
to
make
provision
beforehand
against
the
calamities
incident
to
change
of
feeling
he
was
greatly
astonished
to
find
me
at
once
so
reasonable
and
so
apt
at
reasoning
but
he
made
me
a
solemn
promise
after
which
i
took
his
hand
and
pressed
it
affectionately
we
were
married
at
the
end
of
the
week
secure
of
my
freedom
i
was
able
to
throw
myself
gaily
into
the
petty
details
which
always
accompany
a
ceremony
of
the
kind
and
to
be
my
natural
self
perhaps
i
may
have
been
taken
for
an
old
bird
as
they
say
at
blois
a
young
girl
delighted
with
the
novel
and
hopeful
situation
she
had
contrived
to
make
for
herself
and
may
have
passed
for
a
female
dear
the
difficulties
which
would
beset
my
life
had
appeared
to
me
clearly
as
in
a
vision
and
i
was
sincerely
anxious
to
make
the
happiness
of
the
man
i
married
now
in
the
solitude
of
a
life
like
ours
marriage
soon
becomes
intolerable
unless
the
woman
is
the
presiding
spirit
a
woman
in
such
a
case
needs
the
charm
of
a
mistress
combined
with
the
solid
qualities
of
a
wife
to
introduce
an
element
of
uncertainty
into
pleasure
is
to
prolong
illusion
and
render
lasting
those
selfish
satisfactions
which
all
creatures
hold
and
should
shroud
a
woman
in
expectancy
crown
her
sovereign
and
invest
her
with
an
exhaustless
power
a
redundancy
of
life
that
makes
everything
blossom
around
her
the
more
she
is
mistress
of
herself
the
more
certainly
will
the
love
and
happiness
she
creates
be
fit
to
weather
the
storms
of
life
but
above
all
i
have
insisted
on
the
greatest
secrecy
in
regard
to
our
domestic
arrangements
a
husband
who
submits
to
his
wife
yoke
is
justly
held
an
object
of
ridicule
a
woman
influence
ought
to
be
entirely
concealed
the
charm
of
all
we
do
lies
in
its
unobtrusiveness
if
i
have
made
it
my
task
to
raise
a
drooping
courage
and
restore
their
natural
brightness
to
gifts
which
i
have
dimly
descried
it
must
all
seem
to
spring
from
louis
himself
such
is
the
mission
to
which
i
dedicate
myself
a
mission
surely
not
ignoble
and
which
might
well
satisfy
a
woman
ambition
why
i
could
glory
in
this
secret
which
shall
fill
my
life
with
interest
in
this
task
towards
which
my
every
energy
shall
be
bent
while
it
remains
concealed
from
all
but
god
and
you
i
am
very
nearly
happy
now
but
should
i
be
so
without
a
friendly
heart
in
which
to
pour
the
confession
for
how
make
a
confidant
of
him
my
happiness
would
wound
him
and
has
to
be
concealed
he
is
sensitive
as
a
woman
like
all
men
who
have
suffered
much
for
three
months
we
remained
as
we
were
before
marriage
as
you
may
imagine
during
this
time
i
made
a
close
study
of
many
small
personal
matters
which
have
more
to
do
with
love
than
is
generally
supposed
in
spite
of
my
coldness
louis
grew
bolder
and
his
nature
expanded
i
saw
on
his
face
a
new
expression
a
look
of
youth
the
greater
refinement
which
i
introduced
into
the
house
was
reflected
in
his
person
insensibly
i
became
accustomed
to
his
presence
and
made
another
self
of
him
by
dint
of
constant
watching
i
discovered
how
his
mind
and
countenance
harmonize
the
animal
that
we
call
a
husband
to
quote
your
words
disappeared
and
one
balmy
evening
i
discovered
in
his
stead
a
lover
whose
words
thrilled
me
and
on
whose
arm
i
leant
with
pleasure
beyond
words
in
short
to
be
open
with
you
as
i
would
be
with
god
before
whom
concealment
is
impossible
the
perfect
loyalty
with
which
he
had
kept
his
oath
may
have
piqued
me
and
i
felt
a
fluttering
of
curiosity
in
my
heart
bitterly
ashamed
i
struggled
with
myself
alas
when
pride
is
the
only
motive
for
resistance
excuses
for
capitulation
are
soon
found
we
celebrated
our
union
in
secret
and
secret
it
must
remain
between
us
when
you
are
married
you
will
approve
this
reserve
enough
that
nothing
was
lacking
either
of
satisfaction
for
the
most
fastidious
sentiment
or
of
that
unexpectedness
which
brings
in
a
sense
its
own
sanction
every
witchery
of
imagination
of
passion
of
reluctance
overcome
of
the
ideal
passing
into
reality
played
its
part
yet
in
spite
of
all
this
enchantment
i
once
more
stood
out
for
my
complete
independence
i
ca
tell
you
all
my
reasons
for
this
to
you
alone
shall
i
confide
even
as
much
as
this
i
believe
that
women
whether
passionately
loved
or
not
lose
much
in
their
relation
with
their
husbands
by
not
concealing
their
feelings
about
marriage
and
the
way
they
look
at
it
my
one
joy
and
it
is
supreme
springs
from
the
certainty
of
having
brought
new
life
to
my
husband
before
i
have
borne
him
any
children
louis
has
regained
his
youth
strength
and
spirits
he
is
not
the
same
man
with
magic
touch
i
have
effaced
the
very
memory
of
his
sufferings
it
is
a
complete
metamorphosis
louis
is
really
very
attractive
now
feeling
sure
of
my
affection
he
throws
off
his
reserve
and
displays
unsuspected
gifts
to
be
the
unceasing
spring
of
happiness
for
a
man
who
knows
it
and
adds
gratitude
to
love
ah
dear
one
this
is
a
conviction
which
fortifies
the
soul
even
more
than
the
most
passionate
love
can
do
the
force
thus
developed
at
once
impetuous
and
enduring
simple
and
diversified
brings
forth
ultimately
the
family
that
noble
product
of
womanhood
which
i
realize
now
in
all
its
animating
beauty
the
old
father
has
ceased
to
be
a
miser
he
gives
blindly
whatever
i
wish
for
the
servants
are
content
it
seems
as
though
the
bliss
of
louis
had
let
a
flood
of
sunshine
into
the
household
where
love
has
made
me
queen
even
the
old
man
would
not
be
a
blot
upon
my
pretty
home
and
has
brought
himself
into
line
with
all
my
improvements
to
please
me
he
has
adopted
the
dress
and
with
the
dress
the
manners
of
the
day
we
have
english
horses
a
coupe
a
barouche
and
a
tilbury
the
livery
of
our
servants
is
simple
but
in
good
taste
of
course
we
are
looked
on
as
spendthrifts
i
apply
all
my
intellect
i
am
speaking
quite
seriously
to
managing
my
household
with
economy
and
obtaining
for
it
the
maximum
of
pleasure
with
the
minimum
of
cost
i
have
already
convinced
louis
of
the
necessity
of
getting
roads
made
in
order
that
he
may
earn
the
reputation
of
a
man
interested
in
the
welfare
of
his
district
i
insist
too
on
his
studying
a
great
deal
before
long
i
hope
to
see
him
a
member
of
the
council
general
of
the
department
through
the
influence
of
my
family
and
his
mother
i
have
told
him
plainly
that
i
am
ambitious
and
that
i
was
very
well
pleased
his
father
should
continue
to
look
after
the
estate
and
practise
economies
because
i
wished
him
to
devote
himself
exclusively
to
politics
if
we
had
children
i
should
like
to
see
them
all
prosperous
and
with
good
state
appointments
under
penalty
therefore
of
forfeiting
my
esteem
and
affection
he
must
get
himself
chosen
deputy
for
the
department
at
the
coming
elections
my
family
would
support
his
candidature
and
we
should
then
have
the
delight
of
spending
all
our
winters
in
paris
ah
my
love
by
the
ardor
with
which
he
embraced
my
plans
i
can
gauge
the
depth
of
his
affection
to
conclude
here
is
a
letter
he
wrote
me
yesterday
from
marseilles
where
he
had
gone
to
spend
a
few
hours
my
sweet
renee
when
you
gave
me
permission
to
love
you
i
began
to
believe
in
happiness
now
i
see
it
unfolding
endlessly
before
me
the
past
is
merely
a
dim
memory
a
shadowy
background
without
which
my
present
bliss
would
show
less
radiant
when
i
am
with
you
love
so
transports
me
that
i
am
powerless
to
express
the
depth
of
my
affection
i
can
but
worship
and
admire
only
at
a
distance
does
the
power
of
speech
return
you
are
supremely
beautiful
renee
and
your
beauty
is
of
the
statuesque
and
regal
type
on
which
time
leaves
but
little
impression
no
doubt
the
love
of
husband
and
wife
depends
less
on
outward
beauty
than
on
graces
of
character
which
are
yours
also
in
perfection
still
let
me
say
that
the
certainty
of
having
your
unchanging
beauty
on
which
to
feast
my
eyes
gives
me
a
joy
that
grows
with
every
glance
there
is
a
grace
and
dignity
in
the
lines
of
your
face
expressive
of
the
noble
soul
within
and
breathing
of
purity
beneath
the
vivid
coloring
the
brilliance
of
your
dark
eyes
the
bold
sweep
of
your
forehead
declare
a
spirit
of
no
common
elevation
sound
and
trustworthy
in
every
relation
and
well
braced
to
meet
the
storms
of
life
should
such
arise
the
keynote
of
your
character
is
its
freedom
from
all
pettiness
you
do
not
need
to
be
told
all
this
but
i
write
it
because
i
would
have
you
know
that
i
appreciate
the
treasure
i
possess
your
favors
to
me
however
slight
will
always
make
my
happiness
in
the
future
as
now
for
i
am
sensible
how
much
dignity
there
is
in
our
promise
to
respect
each
other
liberty
our
own
impulse
shall
with
us
alone
dictate
the
expression
of
feeling
we
shall
be
free
even
in
our
fetters
i
shall
have
the
more
pride
in
wooing
you
again
now
that
i
know
the
reward
you
place
on
victory
you
can
not
speak
breathe
act
or
think
without
adding
to
the
admiration
i
feel
for
your
charm
both
of
body
and
mind
there
is
in
you
a
rare
combination
of
the
ideal
the
practical
and
the
bewitching
which
satisfies
alike
judgment
a
husband
pride
desire
and
hope
and
which
extends
the
boundaries
of
love
beyond
those
of
life
itself
oh
my
loved
one
may
the
genius
of
love
remain
faithful
to
me
and
the
future
be
full
of
those
delights
by
means
of
which
you
have
glorified
all
that
surrounds
me
i
long
for
the
day
which
shall
make
you
a
mother
that
i
may
see
you
content
with
the
fulness
of
your
life
may
hear
you
in
the
sweet
voice
i
love
and
with
the
thoughts
bless
the
love
which
has
refreshed
my
soul
and
given
new
vigor
to
my
powers
the
love
which
is
my
pride
and
whence
i
have
drawn
as
from
a
magic
fountain
fresh
life
yes
i
shall
be
all
that
you
would
have
me
i
shall
take
a
leading
part
in
the
public
life
of
the
district
and
on
you
shall
fall
the
rays
of
a
glory
which
will
owe
its
existence
to
the
desire
of
pleasing
you
so
much
for
my
pupil
dear
do
you
suppose
he
could
have
written
like
this
before
a
year
hence
his
style
will
have
still
further
improved
louis
is
now
in
his
first
transport
what
i
look
forward
to
is
the
uniform
and
continuous
sensation
of
content
which
ought
to
be
the
fruit
of
a
happy
marriage
when
a
man
and
woman
in
perfect
trust
and
mutual
knowledge
have
solved
the
problem
of
giving
variety
to
the
infinite
this
is
the
task
set
before
every
true
wife
the
answer
begins
to
dawn
on
me
and
i
shall
not
rest
till
i
have
made
it
mine
you
see
that
he
fancies
himself
vanity
of
men
the
chosen
of
my
heart
just
as
though
there
were
no
legal
bonds
nevertheless
i
have
not
yet
got
beyond
that
external
attraction
which
gives
us
strength
to
put
up
with
a
good
deal
yet
louis
is
lovable
his
temper
is
wonderfully
even
and
he
performs
as
a
matter
of
course
acts
on
which
most
men
would
plume
themselves
in
short
if
i
do
not
love
him
i
shall
find
no
difficulty
in
being
good
to
him
so
here
are
my
black
hair
and
my
black
eyes
whose
lashes
act
according
to
you
like
venetian
blinds
my
commanding
air
and
my
whole
person
raised
to
the
rank
of
sovereign
power
ten
years
hence
dear
why
should
we
not
both
be
laughing
and
gay
in
your
paris
whence
i
shall
carry
you
off
now
and
again
to
my
beautiful
oasis
in
provence
oh
louise
do
spoil
the
splendid
future
which
awaits
us
both
do
the
mad
things
with
which
you
threaten
me
my
husband
is
a
young
man
prematurely
old
why
do
you
marry
some
graybeard
in
the
chamber
of
peers
there
lies
your
vocation
xiv
the
duc
de
soria
to
the
baron
de
macumer
madrid
my
dear
brother
you
did
not
make
me
duc
de
soria
in
order
that
my
actions
should
belie
the
name
how
could
i
tolerate
my
happiness
if
i
knew
you
to
be
a
wanderer
deprived
of
the
comforts
which
wealth
everywhere
commands
neither
marie
nor
i
will
consent
to
marry
till
we
hear
that
you
have
accepted
the
money
which
urraca
will
hand
over
to
you
these
two
millions
are
the
fruit
of
your
own
savings
and
marie
we
have
both
prayed
kneeling
before
the
same
altar
and
with
what
earnestness
god
knows
for
your
happiness
my
dear
brother
it
can
not
be
that
these
prayers
will
remain
unanswered
heaven
will
send
you
the
love
which
you
seek
to
be
the
consolation
of
your
exile
marie
read
your
letter
with
tears
and
is
full
of
admiration
for
you
as
for
me
i
consent
not
for
my
own
sake
but
for
that
of
the
family
the
king
justified
your
expectations
oh
that
i
might
avenge
you
by
letting
him
see
himself
dwarfed
before
the
scorn
with
which
you
flung
him
his
toy
as
you
might
toss
a
tiger
its
food
the
only
thing
i
have
taken
for
myself
dear
brother
is
my
happiness
i
have
taken
marie
for
this
i
shall
always
be
beholden
to
you
as
the
creature
to
the
creator
there
will
be
in
my
life
and
in
marie
one
day
not
less
glorious
than
our
wedding
day
it
will
be
the
day
when
we
hear
that
your
heart
has
found
its
mate
that
a
woman
loves
you
as
you
ought
to
be
and
would
be
loved
do
not
forget
that
if
you
live
for
us
we
also
live
for
you
you
can
write
to
us
with
perfect
confidence
under
cover
to
the
nuncio
sending
your
letters
rome
the
french
ambassador
at
rome
will
no
doubt
undertake
to
forward
them
to
monsignore
bemboni
at
the
state
secretary
office
whom
our
legate
will
have
advised
no
other
way
would
be
safe
farewell
dear
exile
dear
despoiled
one
be
proud
at
least
of
the
happiness
which
you
have
brought
to
us
if
you
can
not
be
happy
in
it
god
will
doubtless
hear
our
prayers
which
are
full
of
your
name
xv
louise
de
chaulieu
to
mme
de
march
ah
my
love
marriage
is
making
a
philosopher
of
you
your
darling
face
must
indeed
have
been
jaundiced
when
you
wrote
me
those
terrible
views
of
human
life
and
the
duty
of
women
do
you
fancy
you
will
convert
me
to
matrimony
by
your
programme
of
subterranean
labors
alas
is
this
then
the
outcome
for
you
of
our
dreams
we
left
blois
all
innocent
armed
with
the
pointed
shafts
of
meditation
and
lo
the
weapons
of
that
purely
ideal
experience
have
turned
against
your
own
breast
if
i
did
not
know
you
for
the
purest
and
most
angelic
of
created
beings
i
declare
i
should
say
that
your
calculations
smack
of
vice
what
my
dear
in
the
interest
of
your
country
home
you
submit
your
pleasures
to
a
periodic
thinning
as
you
do
your
timber
oh
rather
let
me
perish
in
all
the
violence
of
the
heart
storms
than
live
in
the
arid
atmosphere
of
your
cautious
arithmetic
as
girls
we
were
both
unusually
enlightened
because
of
the
large
amount
of
study
we
gave
to
our
chosen
subjects
but
my
child
philosophy
without
love
or
disguised
under
a
sham
love
is
the
most
hideous
of
conjugal
hypocrisies
i
should
imagine
that
even
the
biggest
of
fools
might
detect
now
and
again
the
owl
of
wisdom
squatting
in
your
bower
of
roses
a
ghastly
phantom
sufficient
to
put
to
flight
the
most
promising
of
passions
you
make
your
own
fate
instead
of
waiting
a
plaything
in
its
hands
we
are
each
developing
in
strange
ways
a
large
dose
of
philosophy
to
a
grain
of
love
is
your
recipe
a
large
dose
of
love
to
a
grain
of
philosophy
is
mine
why
rousseau
julie
whom
i
thought
so
learned
is
a
mere
beginner
to
you
woman
virtue
quotha
how
you
have
weighed
up
life
alas
i
make
fun
of
you
and
after
all
perhaps
you
are
right
in
one
day
you
have
made
a
holocaust
of
your
youth
and
become
a
miser
before
your
time
your
louis
will
be
happy
i
daresay
if
he
loves
you
of
which
i
make
no
doubt
he
will
never
find
out
that
for
the
sake
of
your
family
you
are
acting
as
a
courtesan
does
for
money
and
certainly
men
seem
to
find
happiness
with
them
judging
by
the
fortunes
they
squander
thus
a
husband
might
no
doubt
remain
in
love
with
you
but
what
sort
of
gratitude
could
he
feel
in
the
long
run
for
a
woman
who
had
made
of
duplicity
a
sort
of
moral
armor
as
indispensable
as
her
stays
love
dear
is
in
my
eyes
the
first
principle
of
all
the
virtues
conformed
to
the
divine
likeness
like
all
other
first
principles
it
is
not
a
matter
of
arithmetic
it
is
the
infinite
in
us
i
can
not
but
think
you
have
been
trying
to
justify
in
your
own
eyes
the
frightful
position
of
a
girl
married
to
a
man
for
whom
she
feels
nothing
more
than
esteem
you
prate
of
duty
and
make
it
your
rule
and
measure
but
surely
to
take
necessity
as
the
spring
of
action
is
the
moral
theory
of
atheism
to
follow
the
impulse
of
love
and
feeling
is
the
secret
law
of
every
woman
heart
you
are
acting
a
man
part
and
your
louis
will
have
to
play
the
woman
oh
my
dear
your
letter
has
plunged
me
into
an
endless
train
of
thought
i
see
now
that
the
convent
can
never
take
the
place
of
mother
to
a
girl
i
beg
of
you
my
grand
angel
with
the
black
eyes
so
pure
and
proud
so
serious
and
so
pretty
do
not
turn
away
from
these
cries
which
the
first
reading
of
your
letter
has
torn
from
me
i
have
taken
comfort
in
the
thought
that
while
i
was
lamenting
love
was
doubtless
busy
knocking
down
the
scaffolding
of
reason
it
may
be
that
i
shall
do
worse
than
you
without
any
reasoning
or
calculations
passion
is
an
element
in
life
bound
to
have
a
logic
not
less
pitiless
than
yours
monday
yesterday
night
i
placed
myself
at
the
window
as
i
was
going
to
bed
to
look
at
the
sky
which
was
wonderfully
clear
the
stars
were
like
silver
nails
holding
up
a
veil
of
blue
in
the
silence
of
the
night
i
could
hear
some
one
breathing
and
by
the
of
the
stars
i
saw
my
spaniard
perched
like
a
squirrel
on
the
branches
of
one
of
the
trees
lining
the
boulevard
and
doubtless
lost
in
admiration
of
my
windows
the
first
effect
of
this
discovery
was
to
make
me
withdraw
into
the
room
my
feet
and
hands
quite
limp
and
nerveless
but
beneath
the
fear
i
was
conscious
of
a
delicious
undercurrent
of
joy
i
was
overpowered
but
happy
not
one
of
those
clever
frenchmen
who
aspire
to
marry
me
has
had
the
brilliant
idea
of
spending
the
night
in
an
at
the
risk
of
being
carried
off
by
the
watch
my
spaniard
has
no
doubt
been
there
for
some
time
ah
he
wo
give
me
any
more
lessons
he
wants
to
receive
them
well
he
shall
have
one
if
only
he
knew
what
i
said
to
myself
about
his
superficial
ugliness
others
can
philosophize
besides
you
renee
it
was
horrid
i
argued
to
fall
in
love
with
a
handsome
man
is
it
not
practically
avowing
that
the
senses
count
for
three
parts
out
of
four
in
a
passion
which
ought
to
be
having
got
over
my
first
alarm
i
craned
my
neck
behind
the
window
in
order
to
see
him
again
and
well
was
i
rewarded
by
means
of
a
hollow
cane
he
blew
me
in
through
the
window
a
letter
cunningly
rolled
round
a
leaden
pellet
good
heavens
will
he
suppose
i
left
the
window
open
on
purpose
but
what
was
to
be
done
to
shut
it
suddenly
would
be
to
make
oneself
an
accomplice
i
did
better
i
returned
to
my
window
as
though
i
had
seen
nothing
and
heard
nothing
of
the
letter
then
i
said
aloud
come
and
look
at
the
stars
griffith
griffith
was
sleeping
as
only
old
maids
can
but
the
moor
hearing
me
slid
down
and
vanished
with
ghostly
rapidity
he
must
have
been
dying
of
fright
and
so
was
i
for
i
did
not
hear
him
go
away
apparently
he
remained
at
the
foot
of
the
elm
after
a
good
quarter
of
an
hour
during
which
i
lost
myself
in
contemplation
of
the
heavens
and
battled
with
the
waves
of
curiosity
i
closed
my
widow
and
sat
down
on
the
bed
to
unfold
the
delicate
bit
of
paper
with
the
tender
touch
of
a
worker
amongst
the
ancient
manuscripts
at
naples
it
felt
redhot
to
my
fingers
what
a
horrible
power
this
man
has
over
me
i
said
to
myself
all
at
once
i
held
out
the
paper
to
the
candle
i
would
burn
it
without
reading
a
word
then
a
thought
stayed
me
what
can
he
have
to
say
that
he
writes
so
secretly
well
dear
i
burn
it
reflecting
that
though
any
other
girl
in
the
world
would
have
devoured
the
letter
it
was
not
fitting
that
i
de
chaulieu
should
read
it
the
next
day
at
the
italian
opera
he
was
at
his
post
but
i
feel
sure
that
minister
of
a
constitutional
government
though
he
is
he
could
not
discover
the
slightest
agitation
of
mind
in
any
movement
of
mine
i
might
have
seen
nothing
and
received
nothing
the
evening
before
this
was
most
satisfactory
to
me
but
he
looked
very
sad
poor
man
in
spain
it
is
so
natural
for
love
to
come
in
at
the
window
during
the
interval
it
seems
he
came
and
walked
in
the
passages
this
i
learned
from
the
chief
secretary
of
the
spanish
embassy
who
also
told
the
story
of
a
noble
action
of
his
as
duc
de
soria
he
was
to
marry
one
of
the
richest
heiresses
in
spain
the
young
princess
marie
heredia
whose
wealth
would
have
mitigated
the
bitterness
of
exile
but
it
seems
that
marie
disappointing
the
wishes
of
the
fathers
who
had
betrothed
them
in
their
earliest
childhood
loved
the
younger
son
of
the
house
of
soria
to
whom
my
felipe
gave
her
up
allowing
himself
to
be
despoiled
by
the
king
of
spain
he
would
perform
this
piece
of
heroism
quite
simply
i
said
to
the
young
man
you
know
him
then
was
his
ingenuous
reply
my
mother
smiled
what
will
become
of
him
for
he
is
condemned
to
death
i
asked
though
dead
to
spain
he
can
live
in
sardinia
ah
then
spain
is
the
country
of
tombs
as
well
as
castles
i
said
trying
to
carry
it
off
as
a
joke
there
is
everything
in
spain
even
spaniards
of
the
old
school
my
mother
replied
the
baron
de
macumer
obtained
a
passport
not
without
difficulty
from
the
king
of
sardinia
the
young
diplomatist
went
on
he
has
now
become
a
sardinian
subject
and
he
possesses
a
magnificent
estate
in
the
island
with
full
feudal
rights
he
has
a
palace
at
sassari
if
ferdinand
vii
were
to
die
macumer
would
probably
go
in
for
diplomacy
and
the
court
of
turin
would
make
him
ambassador
though
young
he
is
ah
he
is
young
certainly
mademoiselle
though
young
he
is
one
of
the
most
distinguished
men
in
spain
i
scanned
the
house
meanwhile
through
my
and
seemed
to
lend
an
inattentive
ear
to
the
secretary
but
between
ourselves
i
was
wretched
at
having
burnt
his
letter
in
what
terms
would
a
man
like
that
express
his
love
for
he
does
love
me
to
be
loved
adored
in
secret
to
know
that
in
this
house
where
all
the
great
men
of
paris
were
collected
there
was
one
entirely
devoted
to
me
unknown
to
everybody
ah
renee
now
i
understand
the
life
of
paris
its
balls
and
its
gaieties
it
all
flashed
on
me
in
the
true
light
when
we
love
we
must
have
society
were
it
only
to
sacrifice
it
to
our
love
i
felt
a
different
creature
and
such
a
happy
one
my
vanity
pride
all
were
flattered
heaven
knows
what
glances
i
cast
upon
the
audience
little
rogue
the
duchess
whispered
in
my
ear
with
a
smile
yes
renee
my
wily
mother
had
deciphered
the
hidden
joy
in
my
bearing
and
i
could
only
haul
down
my
flag
before
such
feminine
strategy
those
two
words
taught
me
more
of
worldly
wisdom
than
i
have
been
able
to
pick
up
in
a
year
for
we
are
in
march
now
alas
no
more
italian
opera
in
another
month
how
will
life
be
possible
without
that
heavenly
music
when
one
heart
is
full
of
love
when
i
got
home
my
dear
with
determination
worthy
of
a
chaulieu
i
opened
my
window
to
watch
a
shower
of
rain
oh
if
men
knew
the
magic
spell
that
a
heroic
action
throws
over
us
they
would
indeed
rise
to
greatness
a
poltroon
would
turn
hero
what
i
had
learned
about
my
spaniard
drove
me
into
a
very
fever
i
felt
certain
that
he
was
there
ready
to
aim
another
letter
at
me
i
was
right
and
this
time
i
burnt
nothing
here
then
is
the
first
i
have
received
madame
logician
each
to
her
kind
louise
it
is
not
for
your
peerless
beauty
i
love
you
nor
for
your
gifted
mind
your
noble
feeling
the
wondrous
charm
of
all
you
say
and
do
nor
yet
for
your
pride
your
queenly
scorn
of
baser
mortals
a
pride
blent
in
you
with
charity
for
what
angel
could
be
more
tender
louise
i
love
you
because
for
the
sake
of
a
poor
exile
you
have
unbent
this
lofty
majesty
because
by
a
gesture
a
glance
you
have
brought
consolation
to
a
man
so
far
beneath
you
that
the
utmost
he
could
hope
for
was
your
pity
the
pity
of
a
generous
heart
you
are
the
one
woman
whose
eyes
have
shone
with
a
tenderer
light
when
bent
on
me
and
because
you
let
fall
this
glance
a
mere
grain
of
dust
yet
a
grace
surpassing
any
bestowed
on
me
when
i
stood
at
the
summit
of
a
subject
ambition
i
long
to
tell
you
louise
how
dear
you
are
to
me
and
that
my
love
is
for
yourself
alone
without
a
thought
beyond
a
love
that
far
more
than
fulfils
the
conditions
laid
down
by
you
for
an
ideal
passion
know
then
idol
of
my
highest
heaven
that
there
is
in
the
world
an
offshoot
of
the
saracen
race
whose
life
is
in
your
hands
who
will
receive
your
orders
as
a
slave
and
deem
it
an
honor
to
execute
them
i
have
given
myself
to
you
absolutely
and
for
the
mere
joy
of
giving
for
a
single
glance
of
your
eye
for
a
touch
of
the
hand
which
one
day
you
offered
to
your
spanish
master
i
am
but
your
servitor
louise
i
claim
no
more
no
i
dare
not
think
that
i
could
ever
be
loved
but
perchance
my
devotion
may
win
for
me
toleration
since
that
morning
when
you
smiled
upon
me
with
generous
girlish
impulse
divining
the
misery
of
my
lonely
and
rejected
heart
you
reign
there
alone
you
are
the
absolute
ruler
of
my
life
the
queen
of
my
thoughts
the
god
of
my
heart
i
find
you
in
the
sunshine
of
my
home
the
fragrance
of
my
flowers
the
balm
of
the
air
i
breathe
the
pulsing
of
my
blood
the
light
that
visits
me
in
sleep
one
thought
alone
troubled
this
happiness
your
ignorance
all
unknown
to
you
was
this
boundless
devotion
the
trusty
arm
the
blind
slave
the
silent
tool
the
wealth
for
henceforth
all
i
possess
is
mine
only
as
a
trust
which
lay
at
your
disposal
unknown
to
you
the
heart
waiting
to
receive
your
confidence
and
yearning
to
replace
all
that
your
life
i
know
it
well
has
lacked
the
liberal
ancestress
so
ready
to
meet
your
needs
a
father
to
whom
you
could
look
for
protection
in
every
difficulty
a
friend
a
brother
the
secret
of
your
isolation
is
no
secret
to
me
if
i
am
bold
it
is
because
i
long
that
you
should
know
how
much
is
yours
take
all
louise
and
is
so
doing
bestow
on
me
the
one
life
possible
for
me
in
this
world
the
life
of
devotion
in
placing
the
yoke
on
my
neck
you
run
no
risk
i
ask
nothing
but
the
joy
of
knowing
myself
yours
needless
even
to
say
you
will
never
love
me
it
can
not
be
otherwise
i
must
love
you
from
afar
without
hope
without
reward
beyond
my
own
love
in
my
anxiety
to
know
whether
you
will
accept
me
as
your
servant
i
have
racked
my
brain
to
find
some
way
in
which
you
may
communicate
with
me
without
any
danger
of
compromising
yourself
injury
to
your
there
can
be
none
in
sanctioning
a
devotion
which
has
been
yours
for
many
days
without
your
knowledge
let
this
then
be
the
token
at
the
opera
this
evening
if
you
carry
in
your
hand
a
bouquet
consisting
of
one
red
and
one
white
camellia
emblem
of
a
man
blood
at
the
service
of
the
purity
he
worships
that
will
be
my
answer
i
ask
no
more
thenceforth
at
any
moment
ten
years
hence
or
whatever
you
demand
shall
be
done
so
far
as
it
is
possible
for
man
to
do
it
by
your
happy
servant
felipe
henarez
you
must
admit
dear
that
great
lords
know
how
to
love
see
the
spring
of
the
african
lion
what
restrained
fire
what
loyalty
what
sincerity
how
high
a
soul
in
low
estate
i
felt
quite
small
and
dazed
as
i
said
to
myself
what
shall
i
do
it
is
the
mark
of
a
great
man
that
he
puts
to
flight
all
ordinary
calculations
he
is
at
once
sublime
and
touching
childlike
and
of
the
race
of
giants
in
a
single
letter
henarez
has
outstripped
volumes
from
lovelace
or
here
is
true
love
no
beating
about
the
bush
love
may
be
or
it
may
not
but
where
it
is
it
ought
to
reveal
itself
in
its
immensity
here
am
i
shorn
of
all
my
little
arts
to
refuse
or
accept
that
is
the
alternative
boldly
presented
me
without
the
ghost
of
an
opening
for
a
middle
course
no
fencing
allowed
this
is
no
longer
paris
we
are
in
the
heart
of
spain
or
the
far
east
it
is
the
voice
of
abencerrage
and
it
is
the
scimitar
the
horse
and
the
head
of
abencerrage
which
he
offers
prostrate
before
a
catholic
eve
shall
i
accept
this
last
descendant
of
the
moors
read
again
and
again
his
letter
renee
dear
and
you
will
see
how
love
makes
a
clean
sweep
of
all
the
judaic
bargains
of
your
philosophy
renee
your
letter
lies
heavy
on
my
heart
you
have
vulgarized
life
for
me
what
need
have
i
for
finessing
am
i
not
mistress
for
all
time
of
this
lion
whose
roar
dies
out
in
plaintive
and
adoring
sighs
ah
how
he
must
have
raged
in
his
lair
of
the
rue
i
know
where
he
lives
i
have
his
card
baron
de
he
has
made
it
impossible
for
me
to
reply
all
i
can
do
is
to
fling
two
camellias
in
his
face
what
fiendish
arts
does
love
possess
pure
honest
love
here
is
the
most
tremendous
crisis
of
a
woman
heart
resolved
into
an
easy
simple
action
oh
asia
i
have
read
the
here
is
their
very
essence
two
flowers
and
the
question
is
settled
we
clear
the
fourteen
volumes
of
with
a
bouquet
i
writhe
before
this
letter
like
a
thread
in
the
fire
to
take
or
not
to
take
my
two
camellias
yes
or
no
kill
or
give
life
at
last
a
voice
cries
to
me
test
him
and
i
will
test
him
xvi
the
same
to
the
same
march
i
am
dressed
in
white
white
camellias
in
my
hair
and
another
in
my
hand
my
mother
has
red
camellias
so
it
would
not
be
impossible
to
take
one
from
her
if
i
wished
i
have
a
strange
longing
to
put
off
the
decision
to
the
last
moment
and
make
him
pay
for
his
red
camellia
by
a
little
suspense
what
a
vision
of
beauty
griffith
begged
me
to
stop
for
a
little
and
be
admired
the
solemn
crisis
of
the
evening
and
the
drama
of
my
secret
reply
have
given
me
a
color
on
each
cheek
i
sport
a
red
camellia
laid
upon
a
white
everybody
admired
me
but
only
one
adored
he
hung
his
head
as
i
entered
with
a
white
camellia
but
turned
pale
as
the
flower
when
later
i
took
a
red
one
from
my
mother
hand
to
arrive
with
the
two
flowers
might
possibly
have
been
accidental
but
this
deliberate
action
was
a
reply
my
confession
therefore
is
fuller
than
it
need
have
been
the
opera
was
and
as
you
do
know
the
duet
of
the
two
lovers
you
ca
understand
the
bliss
of
two
neophytes
in
love
as
they
listen
to
this
divine
outpouring
of
the
heart
on
returning
home
i
went
to
bed
but
only
to
count
the
steps
which
resounded
on
the
sidewalk
my
heart
and
head
darling
are
all
on
fire
now
what
is
he
doing
what
is
he
thinking
of
has
he
a
thought
a
single
thought
that
is
not
of
me
is
he
in
very
truth
the
devoted
slave
he
painted
himself
how
to
be
sure
or
again
has
it
ever
entered
his
head
that
if
i
accept
him
i
lay
myself
open
to
the
shadow
of
a
reproach
or
am
in
any
sense
rewarding
or
thanking
him
i
am
harrowed
by
the
casuistry
of
the
heroines
in
and
by
all
the
subtle
arguments
of
the
court
of
love
has
he
any
idea
that
in
affairs
of
love
a
woman
most
trifling
actions
are
but
the
issue
of
long
brooding
and
inner
conflicts
of
victories
won
only
to
be
lost
what
are
his
thoughts
at
this
moment
how
can
i
give
him
my
orders
to
write
every
evening
the
particulars
of
the
day
just
gone
he
is
my
slave
whom
i
ought
to
keep
busy
i
shall
deluge
him
with
work
sunday
morning
only
towards
morning
did
i
sleep
a
little
it
is
midday
now
i
have
just
got
griffith
to
write
the
following
letter
the
baron
de
mademoiselle
de
chaulieu
begs
me
monsieur
le
baron
to
ask
you
to
return
to
her
the
copy
of
a
letter
written
to
her
by
a
friend
which
is
in
her
own
handwriting
and
which
you
carried
believe
me
griffith
my
dear
griffith
has
gone
out
she
has
gone
to
the
rue
she
had
handed
in
this
little
for
my
slave
who
returned
to
me
in
an
envelope
my
sweet
portrait
stained
with
tears
he
has
obeyed
oh
my
sweet
it
must
have
been
dear
to
him
another
man
would
have
refused
to
send
it
in
a
letter
full
of
flattery
but
the
saracen
has
fulfilled
his
promises
he
has
obeyed
it
moves
me
to
tears
xvii
the
same
to
the
same
april
yesterday
the
weather
was
splendid
i
dressed
myself
like
a
girl
who
wants
to
look
her
best
in
her
sweetheart
eyes
my
father
yielding
to
my
entreaties
has
given
me
the
prettiest
turnout
in
paris
two
horses
and
a
barouche
which
is
a
masterpiece
of
elegance
i
was
making
a
first
trial
of
this
and
peeped
out
like
a
flower
from
under
my
sunshade
lined
with
white
silk
as
i
drove
up
the
avenue
of
the
i
saw
my
abencerrage
approaching
on
an
extraordinarily
beautiful
horse
almost
every
man
nowadays
is
a
finished
jockey
and
they
all
stopped
to
admire
and
inspect
it
he
bowed
to
me
and
on
receiving
a
friendly
sign
of
encouragement
slackened
his
horse
pace
so
that
i
was
able
to
say
to
him
you
are
not
vexed
with
me
for
asking
for
my
letter
it
was
no
use
to
you
then
in
a
lower
voice
you
have
already
transcended
the
ideal
your
horse
makes
you
an
object
of
general
interest
i
went
on
aloud
my
steward
in
sardinia
sent
it
to
me
he
is
very
proud
of
it
for
this
horse
which
is
of
arab
blood
was
born
in
my
stables
this
morning
my
dear
henarez
was
on
an
english
sorrel
also
very
fine
but
not
such
as
to
attract
attention
my
light
mocking
words
had
done
their
work
he
bowed
to
me
and
i
replied
with
a
slight
inclination
of
the
head
the
duc
has
bought
macumer
horse
my
slave
understood
that
he
was
deserting
the
role
of
simplicity
by
attracting
the
notice
of
the
crowd
a
man
ought
to
be
remarked
for
what
he
is
not
for
his
horse
or
anything
else
belonging
to
him
to
have
too
beautiful
a
horse
seems
to
me
a
piece
of
bad
taste
just
as
much
as
wearing
a
huge
diamond
pin
i
was
delighted
at
being
able
to
find
fault
with
him
perhaps
there
may
have
been
a
touch
of
vanity
in
what
he
did
very
excusable
in
a
poor
exile
and
i
like
to
see
this
childishness
oh
my
dear
old
preacher
do
my
love
affairs
amuse
you
as
much
as
your
dismal
philosophy
gives
me
the
creeps
dear
philip
the
second
in
petticoats
are
you
comfortable
in
my
barouche
do
you
see
those
velvet
eyes
humble
yet
so
eloquent
and
glorying
in
their
servitude
which
flash
on
me
as
some
one
goes
by
he
is
a
hero
renee
and
he
wears
my
livery
and
always
a
red
camellia
in
his
buttonhole
while
i
have
always
a
white
one
in
my
hand
how
clear
everything
becomes
in
the
light
of
love
how
well
i
know
my
paris
now
it
is
all
transfused
with
meaning
and
love
here
is
lovelier
grander
more
bewitching
than
elsewhere
i
am
convinced
now
that
i
could
never
flirt
with
a
fool
or
make
any
impression
on
him
it
is
only
men
of
real
distinction
who
can
enter
into
our
feelings
and
feel
our
influence
oh
my
poor
friend
forgive
me
i
forgot
our
but
did
you
tell
me
you
were
going
to
make
a
genius
of
him
i
know
what
that
means
you
will
dry
nurse
him
till
some
day
he
is
able
to
understand
you
i
am
a
little
off
my
head
and
must
stop
xviii
mme
de
to
louise
de
chaulieu
april
my
angel
or
ought
i
not
rather
to
say
my
imp
of
evil
you
have
without
meaning
it
grieved
me
sorely
i
would
say
wounded
were
we
not
one
soul
and
yet
it
is
possible
to
wound
oneself
how
plain
it
is
that
you
have
never
realized
the
force
of
the
word
as
applied
to
the
contract
binding
man
and
woman
i
have
no
wish
to
controvert
what
has
been
laid
down
by
philosophers
or
legislators
they
are
quite
capable
of
doing
this
for
themselves
but
dear
one
in
making
marriage
irrevocable
and
imposing
on
it
a
relentless
formula
which
admits
of
no
exceptions
they
have
rendered
each
union
a
thing
as
distinct
as
one
individual
is
from
another
each
has
its
own
inner
laws
which
differ
from
those
of
others
the
laws
regulating
married
life
in
the
country
for
instance
can
not
be
the
same
as
those
regulating
a
household
in
town
where
frequent
distractions
give
variety
to
life
or
conversely
married
life
in
paris
where
existence
is
one
perpetual
whirl
must
demand
different
treatment
from
the
more
peaceful
home
in
the
provinces
but
if
place
alters
the
conditions
of
marriage
much
more
does
character
the
wife
of
a
man
born
to
be
a
leader
need
only
resign
herself
to
his
guidance
whereas
the
wife
of
a
fool
conscious
of
superior
power
is
bound
to
take
the
reins
in
her
own
hand
if
she
would
avert
calamity
you
speak
of
vice
and
it
is
possible
that
after
all
reason
and
reflection
produce
a
result
not
dissimilar
from
what
we
call
by
that
name
for
what
does
a
woman
mean
by
it
but
perversion
of
feeling
through
calculation
passion
is
vicious
when
it
reasons
admirable
only
when
it
springs
from
the
heart
and
spends
itself
in
sublime
impulses
that
set
at
naught
all
selfish
considerations
sooner
or
later
dear
one
you
too
will
say
yes
dissimulation
is
the
necessary
armor
of
a
woman
if
by
dissimulation
be
meant
courage
to
bear
in
silence
prudence
to
foresee
the
future
every
married
woman
learns
to
her
cost
the
existence
of
certain
social
laws
which
in
many
respects
conflict
with
the
laws
of
nature
marrying
at
our
age
it
would
be
possible
to
have
a
dozen
children
what
is
this
but
another
name
for
a
dozen
crimes
a
dozen
misfortunes
it
would
be
handing
over
to
poverty
and
despair
twelve
innocent
darlings
whereas
two
children
would
mean
the
happiness
of
both
a
double
blessing
two
lives
capable
of
developing
in
harmony
with
the
customs
and
laws
of
our
time
the
natural
law
and
the
code
are
in
hostility
and
we
are
the
battle
ground
would
you
give
the
name
of
vice
to
the
prudence
of
the
wife
who
guards
her
family
from
destruction
through
its
own
acts
one
calculation
or
a
thousand
what
matter
if
the
decision
no
longer
rests
with
the
heart
and
of
this
terrible
calculation
you
will
be
guilty
some
day
my
noble
baronne
de
macumer
when
you
are
the
proud
and
happy
wife
of
the
man
who
adores
you
or
rather
being
a
man
of
sense
he
will
spare
you
by
making
it
himself
you
see
dear
dreamer
that
i
have
studied
the
code
in
its
bearings
on
conjugal
relations
and
when
at
last
that
day
comes
you
will
understand
that
we
are
answerable
only
to
god
and
to
ourselves
for
the
means
we
employ
to
keep
happiness
alight
in
the
heart
of
our
homes
far
better
is
the
calculation
which
succeeds
in
this
than
the
reckless
passion
which
introduces
trouble
and
dissension
i
have
reflected
painfully
on
the
duties
of
a
wife
and
mother
of
a
family
yes
sweet
one
it
is
only
by
a
sublime
hypocrisy
that
we
can
attain
the
noblest
ideal
of
a
perfect
woman
you
tax
me
with
insincerity
because
i
dole
out
to
louis
from
day
to
day
the
measure
of
his
intimacy
with
me
but
is
it
not
too
close
an
intimacy
which
provokes
rupture
my
aim
is
to
give
him
in
the
very
interest
of
his
happiness
many
occupations
which
will
all
serve
as
distractions
to
his
love
and
this
is
not
the
reasoning
of
passion
if
affection
be
inexhaustible
it
is
not
so
with
love
the
task
therefore
of
a
woman
truly
no
light
one
is
to
spread
it
out
thriftily
over
a
lifetime
at
the
risk
of
exciting
your
disgust
i
must
tell
you
that
i
persist
in
the
principles
i
have
adopted
and
hold
myself
both
heroic
and
generous
in
so
doing
virtue
my
pet
is
an
abstract
idea
varying
in
its
manifestations
with
the
surroundings
virtue
in
provence
in
constantinople
in
london
and
in
paris
bears
very
different
fruit
but
is
none
the
less
virtue
each
human
life
is
a
substance
compacted
of
widely
dissimilar
elements
though
viewed
from
a
certain
height
the
general
effect
is
the
same
if
i
wished
to
make
louis
unhappy
and
to
bring
about
a
separation
all
i
need
do
is
to
leave
the
helm
in
his
hands
i
have
not
had
your
good
fortune
in
meeting
with
a
man
of
the
highest
distinction
but
i
may
perhaps
have
the
satisfaction
of
helping
him
on
the
road
to
it
five
years
hence
let
us
meet
in
paris
and
see
i
believe
we
shall
succeed
in
mystifying
you
you
will
tell
me
then
that
i
was
quite
mistaken
and
that
de
is
a
man
of
great
natural
gifts
as
for
this
brave
love
of
which
i
know
only
what
you
tell
me
these
tremors
and
night
watches
by
starlight
on
the
balcony
this
idolatrous
worship
this
deification
of
woman
i
knew
it
was
not
for
me
you
can
enlarge
the
borders
of
your
brilliant
life
as
you
please
mine
is
hemmed
in
to
the
boundaries
of
la
crampade
and
you
reproach
me
for
the
jealous
care
which
alone
can
nurse
this
modest
and
fragile
shoot
into
a
wealth
of
lasting
and
mysterious
happiness
i
believed
myself
to
have
found
out
how
to
adapt
the
charm
of
a
mistress
to
the
position
of
a
wife
and
you
have
almost
made
me
blush
for
my
device
who
shall
say
which
of
us
is
right
which
is
wrong
perhaps
we
are
both
right
and
both
wrong
perhaps
this
is
the
heavy
price
which
society
exacts
for
our
furbelows
our
titles
and
our
children
i
too
have
my
red
camellias
but
they
bloom
on
my
lips
in
smiles
for
my
double
charge
the
father
and
the
son
whose
slave
and
mistress
i
am
but
my
dear
your
last
letters
made
me
feel
what
i
have
lost
you
have
taught
me
all
a
woman
sacrifices
in
marrying
one
single
glance
did
i
take
at
those
beautiful
wild
plateaus
where
you
range
at
your
sweet
will
and
i
will
not
tell
you
the
tears
that
fell
as
i
read
but
regret
is
not
remorse
though
it
may
be
first
cousin
to
it
you
say
marriage
has
made
you
a
philosopher
alas
bitterly
did
i
feel
how
far
this
was
from
the
truth
as
i
wept
to
think
of
you
swept
away
on
love
torrent
but
my
father
has
made
me
read
one
of
the
profoundest
thinkers
of
these
parts
the
man
on
whom
the
mantle
of
boussuet
has
fallen
one
of
those
theorists
whose
words
force
conviction
while
you
were
reading
i
conned
bonald
and
here
is
the
whole
secret
of
my
philosophy
he
revealed
to
me
the
family
in
its
strength
and
holiness
according
to
bonald
your
father
was
right
in
his
homily
farewell
my
dear
fancy
my
friend
my
wild
other
self
xix
louise
de
chaulieu
to
mme
de
well
my
renee
you
are
a
love
of
a
woman
and
i
quite
agree
now
that
we
can
only
be
virtuous
by
cheating
will
that
satisfy
you
moreover
the
man
who
loves
us
is
our
property
we
can
make
a
fool
or
a
genius
of
him
as
we
please
only
between
ourselves
the
former
happens
more
commonly
you
will
make
yours
a
genius
and
you
wo
tell
the
secret
there
are
two
heroic
actions
if
you
will
ah
if
there
were
no
future
life
how
nicely
you
would
be
sold
for
this
is
martyrdom
into
which
you
are
plunging
of
your
own
accord
you
want
to
make
him
ambitious
and
to
keep
him
in
love
child
that
you
are
surely
the
last
alone
is
sufficient
tell
me
to
what
point
is
calculation
a
virtue
or
virtue
calculation
you
wo
say
well
we
wo
quarrel
over
that
since
we
have
bonald
to
refer
to
we
are
and
intend
to
remain
virtuous
nevertheless
at
this
moment
i
believe
that
you
with
all
your
pretty
little
knavery
are
a
better
woman
than
i
am
yes
i
am
shockingly
deceitful
i
love
felipe
and
i
conceal
it
from
him
with
an
odious
hypocrisy
i
long
to
see
him
leap
from
his
tree
to
the
top
of
the
wall
and
from
the
wall
to
my
balcony
and
if
he
did
how
i
should
wither
him
with
my
scorn
you
see
i
am
frank
enough
with
you
what
restrains
me
where
is
the
mysterious
power
which
prevents
me
from
telling
felipe
dear
fellow
how
supremely
happy
he
has
made
me
by
the
outpouring
of
his
love
so
pure
so
absolute
so
boundless
so
unobtrusive
and
so
overflowing
mme
de
mirbel
is
painting
my
portrait
and
i
intend
to
give
it
to
him
my
dear
what
surprises
me
more
and
more
every
day
is
the
animation
which
love
puts
into
life
how
full
of
interest
is
every
hour
every
action
every
trifle
and
what
amazing
confusion
between
the
past
the
future
and
the
present
one
lives
in
three
tenses
at
once
is
it
still
so
after
the
heights
of
happiness
are
reached
oh
tell
me
i
implore
you
what
is
happiness
does
it
soothe
or
does
it
excite
i
am
horribly
restless
i
seem
to
have
lost
all
my
bearings
a
force
in
my
heart
drags
me
to
him
spite
of
reason
and
spite
of
propriety
there
is
this
gain
that
i
am
better
able
to
enter
into
your
feelings
felipe
happiness
consists
in
feeling
himself
mine
the
aloofness
of
his
love
his
strict
obedience
irritate
me
just
as
his
attitude
of
profound
respect
provoked
me
when
he
was
only
my
spanish
master
i
am
tempted
to
cry
out
to
him
as
he
passes
fool
if
you
love
me
so
much
as
a
picture
what
will
it
be
when
you
know
the
real
me
oh
renee
you
burn
my
letters
do
you
i
will
burn
yours
if
other
eyes
than
ours
were
to
read
these
thoughts
which
pass
from
heart
to
heart
i
should
send
felipe
to
put
them
out
and
perhaps
to
kill
the
owners
by
way
of
additional
security
monday
oh
renee
how
is
it
possible
to
fathom
the
heart
of
man
my
father
ought
to
introduce
me
to
bonald
since
he
is
so
learned
i
would
ask
him
i
envy
the
privilege
of
god
who
can
read
the
undercurrents
of
the
heart
does
he
still
worship
that
is
the
whole
question
if
ever
in
gesture
glance
or
tone
i
were
to
detect
the
slightest
falling
off
in
the
respect
he
used
to
show
me
in
the
days
when
he
was
my
instructor
in
spanish
i
feel
that
i
should
have
strength
to
put
the
whole
thing
from
me
why
these
fine
words
these
grand
resolutions
you
will
say
dear
i
will
tell
you
my
fascinating
father
who
treats
me
with
the
devotion
of
an
italian
for
his
lady
had
my
portrait
painted
as
i
told
you
by
mme
de
mirbel
i
contrived
to
get
a
copy
made
good
enough
to
do
for
the
duke
and
sent
the
original
to
felipe
i
despatched
it
yesterday
and
these
lines
with
it
don
felipe
your
devotion
is
met
by
a
blind
confidence
time
will
show
whether
this
is
not
to
treat
a
man
as
more
than
human
it
was
a
big
reward
it
looked
like
a
promise
and
dreadful
to
say
a
challenge
but
which
will
seem
to
you
still
more
dreadful
i
quite
intended
that
it
should
suggest
both
these
things
without
going
so
far
as
actually
to
commit
me
if
in
his
reply
there
is
dear
louise
or
even
louise
he
is
done
for
tuesday
no
he
is
not
done
for
the
constitutional
minister
is
perfect
as
a
lover
here
is
his
letter
every
moment
passed
away
from
your
sight
has
been
filled
by
me
with
ideal
pictures
of
you
my
eyes
closed
to
the
outside
world
and
fixed
in
meditation
on
your
image
which
used
to
obey
the
summons
too
slowly
in
that
dim
palace
of
dreams
glorified
by
your
presence
henceforth
my
gaze
will
rest
upon
this
wondrous
ivory
this
talisman
might
i
not
say
since
your
blue
eyes
sparkle
with
life
as
i
look
and
paint
passes
into
flesh
and
blood
if
i
have
delayed
writing
it
is
because
i
could
not
tear
myself
away
from
your
presence
which
wrung
from
me
all
that
i
was
bound
to
keep
most
secret
yes
closeted
with
you
all
last
night
and
i
have
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
given
myself
up
to
full
complete
and
boundless
happiness
could
you
but
see
yourself
where
i
have
placed
you
between
the
virgin
and
god
you
might
have
some
idea
of
the
agony
in
which
the
night
has
passed
but
i
would
not
offend
you
by
speaking
of
it
for
one
glance
from
your
eyes
robbed
of
the
tender
sweetness
which
is
my
life
would
be
full
of
torture
for
me
and
i
implore
your
clemency
therefore
in
advance
queen
of
my
life
and
of
my
soul
oh
that
you
could
grant
me
but
thousandth
part
of
the
love
i
bear
you
this
was
the
burden
of
my
prayer
doubt
worked
havoc
in
my
soul
as
i
oscillated
between
belief
and
despair
between
life
and
death
darkness
and
light
a
criminal
whose
verdict
hangs
in
the
balance
is
not
more
racked
with
suspense
than
i
as
i
own
to
my
temerity
the
smile
imaged
on
your
lips
to
which
my
eyes
turned
ever
and
again
and
alone
able
to
calm
the
storm
roused
by
the
dread
of
displeasing
you
from
my
birth
no
one
not
even
my
mother
has
smiled
on
me
the
beautiful
young
girl
who
was
designed
for
me
rejected
my
heart
and
gave
hers
to
my
brother
again
in
politics
all
my
efforts
have
been
defeated
in
the
eyes
of
my
king
i
have
read
only
thirst
for
vengeance
from
childhood
he
has
been
my
enemy
and
the
vote
of
the
cortes
which
placed
me
in
power
was
regarded
by
him
as
a
personal
insult
less
than
this
might
breed
despondency
in
the
stoutest
heart
besides
i
have
no
illusion
i
know
the
gracelessness
of
my
person
and
am
well
aware
how
difficult
it
is
to
do
justice
to
the
heart
within
so
rugged
a
shell
to
be
loved
had
ceased
to
be
more
than
a
dream
to
me
when
i
met
you
thus
when
i
bound
myself
to
your
service
i
knew
that
devotion
alone
could
excuse
my
passion
but
as
i
look
upon
this
portrait
and
listen
to
your
smile
that
whispers
of
rapture
the
rays
of
a
hope
which
i
had
sternly
banished
pierced
the
gloom
like
the
light
of
dawn
again
to
be
obscured
by
rising
mists
of
doubt
and
fear
of
your
displeasure
if
the
morning
should
break
to
day
no
it
is
impossible
you
should
love
me
yet
i
feel
it
but
in
time
as
you
make
proof
of
the
strength
the
constancy
and
depth
of
my
affection
you
may
yield
me
some
foothold
in
your
heart
if
my
daring
offends
you
tell
me
so
without
anger
and
i
will
return
to
my
former
part
but
if
you
consent
to
try
and
love
me
be
merciful
and
break
it
gently
to
one
who
has
placed
the
happiness
of
his
life
in
the
single
thought
of
serving
you
my
dear
as
i
read
these
last
words
he
seemed
to
rise
before
me
pale
as
the
night
when
the
camellias
told
their
story
and
he
knew
his
offering
was
accepted
these
words
in
their
humility
were
clearly
something
quite
different
from
the
usual
flowery
rhetoric
of
lovers
and
a
wave
of
feeling
broke
over
me
it
was
the
breath
of
happiness
the
weather
has
been
atrocious
impossible
to
go
to
the
bois
without
exciting
all
sorts
of
suspicions
even
my
mother
who
often
goes
out
regardless
of
rain
remains
at
home
and
alone
wednesday
evening
i
have
just
seen
at
the
opera
my
dear
he
is
another
man
he
came
to
our
box
introduced
by
the
sardinian
ambassador
having
read
in
my
eyes
that
this
audacity
was
taken
in
good
part
he
seemed
awkwardly
conscious
of
his
limbs
and
addressed
the
marquise
as
mademoiselle
a
light
far
brighter
than
the
glare
of
the
chandeliers
flashed
from
his
eyes
at
last
he
went
out
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
did
know
what
he
might
do
next
the
baron
de
macumer
is
in
love
exclaimed
mme
de
maufrigneuse
strange
is
it
for
a
fallen
minister
replied
my
mother
i
had
sufficient
presence
of
mind
myself
to
regard
with
curiosity
mmes
de
maufrigneuse
and
and
my
mother
as
though
they
were
talking
a
foreign
language
and
i
wanted
to
know
what
it
was
all
about
but
inwardly
my
soul
sank
in
the
waves
of
an
intoxicating
joy
there
is
only
one
word
to
express
what
i
felt
and
that
is
rapture
such
love
as
felipe
surely
makes
him
worthy
of
mine
i
am
the
very
breath
of
his
life
my
hands
hold
the
thread
that
guides
his
thoughts
to
be
quite
frank
i
have
a
mad
longing
to
see
him
clear
every
obstacle
and
stand
before
me
asking
boldly
for
my
hand
then
i
should
know
whether
this
storm
of
love
would
sink
to
placid
calm
at
a
glance
from
me
ah
my
dear
i
stopped
here
and
i
am
still
all
in
a
tremble
as
i
wrote
i
heard
a
slight
noise
outside
and
rose
to
see
what
it
was
from
my
window
i
could
see
him
coming
along
the
ridge
of
the
wall
at
the
risk
of
his
life
i
went
to
the
bedroom
window
and
made
him
a
sign
it
was
enough
he
leaped
from
the
wall
ten
feet
and
then
ran
along
the
road
as
far
as
i
could
see
him
in
order
to
show
me
that
he
was
not
hurt
that
he
should
think
of
my
fear
at
the
moment
when
he
must
have
been
stunned
by
his
fall
moved
me
so
much
that
i
am
still
crying
i
know
why
poor
ungainly
man
what
was
he
coming
for
what
had
he
to
say
to
me
i
dare
not
write
my
thoughts
and
shall
go
to
bed
joyful
thinking
of
all
that
we
would
say
if
we
were
together
farewell
fair
silent
one
i
have
not
time
to
scold
you
for
not
writing
but
it
is
more
than
a
month
since
i
have
heard
from
you
does
this
mean
that
you
are
at
last
happy
have
you
lost
the
complete
independence
which
you
were
so
proud
of
and
which
has
so
nearly
played
me
false
xx
renee
de
to
louise
de
chaulieu
may
if
love
be
the
life
of
the
world
why
do
austere
philosophers
count
it
for
nothing
in
marriage
why
should
society
take
for
its
first
law
that
the
woman
must
be
sacrificed
to
the
family
introducing
thus
a
note
of
discord
into
the
very
heart
of
marriage
and
this
discord
was
foreseen
since
it
was
to
meet
the
dangers
arising
from
it
that
men
were
armed
with
powers
against
us
but
for
these
we
should
have
been
able
to
bring
their
whole
theory
to
nothing
whether
by
the
force
of
love
or
of
a
secret
persistent
aversion
i
see
in
marriage
as
it
at
present
exists
two
opposing
forces
which
it
was
the
task
of
the
lawgiver
to
reconcile
when
will
they
be
reconciled
i
said
to
myself
as
i
read
your
letter
oh
my
dear
one
such
letter
alone
is
enough
to
overthrow
the
whole
fabric
constructed
by
the
sage
of
aveyron
under
whose
shelter
i
had
so
cheerfully
ensconced
myself
the
laws
were
made
by
old
men
any
woman
can
see
that
and
they
have
been
prudent
enough
to
decree
that
conjugal
love
apart
from
passion
is
not
degrading
and
that
a
woman
in
yielding
herself
may
dispense
with
the
sanction
of
love
provided
the
man
can
legally
call
her
his
in
their
exclusive
concern
for
the
family
they
have
imitated
nature
whose
one
care
is
to
propagate
the
species
formerly
i
was
a
person
now
i
am
a
chattel
not
a
few
tears
have
i
gulped
down
alone
and
far
from
every
one
how
gladly
would
i
have
exchanged
them
for
a
consoling
smile
why
are
our
destinies
so
unequal
your
soul
expands
in
the
atmosphere
of
a
lawful
passion
for
you
virtue
will
coincide
with
pleasure
if
you
encounter
pain
it
will
be
of
your
own
free
choice
your
duty
if
you
marry
felipe
will
be
one
with
the
sweetest
freest
indulgence
of
feeling
our
future
is
big
with
the
answer
to
my
question
and
i
look
for
it
with
restless
eagerness
you
love
and
are
adored
oh
my
dear
let
this
noble
romance
the
old
subject
of
our
dreams
take
full
possession
of
your
soul
womanly
beauty
refined
and
spiritualized
in
you
was
created
by
god
for
his
own
purposes
to
charm
and
to
delight
yes
my
sweet
guard
well
the
secret
of
your
heart
and
submit
felipe
to
those
ingenious
devices
of
ours
for
testing
a
lover
metal
above
all
make
trial
of
your
own
love
for
this
is
even
more
important
it
is
so
easy
to
be
misled
by
the
deceptive
glamour
of
novelty
and
passion
and
by
the
vision
of
happiness
alone
of
the
two
friends
you
remain
in
your
maiden
independence
and
i
beseech
you
dearest
do
not
risk
the
irrevocable
step
of
marriage
without
some
guarantee
it
happens
sometimes
when
two
are
talking
together
apart
from
the
world
their
souls
stripped
of
social
disguise
that
a
gesture
a
word
a
look
lights
up
as
by
a
flash
some
dark
abyss
you
have
courage
and
strength
to
tread
boldly
in
paths
where
others
would
be
lost
you
have
no
conception
in
what
anxiety
i
watch
you
across
all
this
space
i
see
you
my
heart
beats
with
yours
be
sure
therefore
to
write
and
tell
me
everything
your
letters
create
an
inner
life
of
passion
within
my
homely
peaceful
household
which
reminds
me
of
a
level
highroad
on
a
gray
day
the
only
event
here
my
sweet
is
that
i
am
playing
with
myself
but
i
do
want
to
tell
you
about
it
just
now
it
must
wait
for
another
day
with
dogged
obstinacy
i
pass
from
despair
to
hope
now
yielding
now
holding
back
it
may
be
that
i
ask
from
life
more
than
we
have
a
right
to
claim
in
youth
we
are
so
ready
to
believe
that
the
ideal
and
the
real
will
harmonize
i
have
been
pondering
alone
seated
beneath
a
rock
in
my
park
and
the
fruit
of
my
pondering
is
that
love
in
marriage
is
a
happy
accident
on
which
it
is
impossible
to
base
a
universal
law
my
aveyron
philosopher
is
right
in
looking
on
the
family
as
the
only
possible
unit
in
society
and
in
placing
woman
in
subjection
to
the
family
as
she
has
been
in
all
ages
the
solution
of
this
great
for
us
almost
awful
question
lies
in
our
first
child
for
this
reason
i
would
gladly
be
a
mother
were
it
only
to
supply
food
for
the
consuming
energy
of
my
soul
louis
temper
remains
as
perfect
as
ever
his
love
is
of
the
active
my
tenderness
of
the
passive
type
he
is
happy
plucking
the
flowers
which
bloom
for
him
without
troubling
about
the
labor
of
the
earth
which
has
produced
them
blessed
at
whatever
cost
to
myself
i
fall
in
with
his
illusions
as
a
mother
in
my
idea
of
her
should
be
ready
to
spend
herself
to
satisfy
a
fancy
of
her
child
the
intensity
of
his
joy
blinds
him
and
even
throws
its
reflection
upon
me
the
smile
or
look
of
satisfaction
which
the
knowledge
of
his
content
brings
to
my
face
is
enough
to
satisfy
him
and
so
my
child
is
the
pet
name
which
i
give
him
when
we
are
alone
and
i
wait
for
the
fruit
of
all
these
sacrifices
which
remain
a
secret
between
god
myself
and
you
on
motherhood
i
have
staked
enormously
my
credit
account
is
now
too
large
i
fear
i
shall
never
receive
full
payment
to
it
i
look
for
employment
of
my
energy
expansion
of
my
heart
and
the
compensation
of
a
world
of
joys
pray
heaven
i
be
not
deceived
it
is
a
question
of
all
my
future
and
horrible
thought
of
my
virtue
xxi
louise
de
chaulieu
to
renee
de
june
dear
wedded
sweetheart
your
letter
has
arrived
at
the
very
moment
to
hearten
me
for
a
bold
step
which
i
have
been
meditating
night
and
day
i
feel
within
me
a
strange
craving
for
the
unknown
or
if
you
will
the
forbidden
which
makes
me
uneasy
and
reveals
a
conflict
in
progress
in
my
soul
between
the
laws
of
society
and
of
nature
i
can
not
tell
whether
nature
in
me
is
the
stronger
of
the
two
but
i
surprise
myself
in
the
act
of
meditating
between
the
hostile
powers
in
plain
words
what
i
wanted
was
to
speak
with
felipe
alone
at
night
under
the
at
the
bottom
of
our
garden
there
is
no
denying
that
this
desire
beseems
the
girl
who
has
earned
the
epithet
of
an
young
lady
bestowed
on
me
by
the
duchess
in
jest
and
which
my
father
has
approved
yet
to
me
there
seems
a
method
in
this
madness
i
should
recompense
felipe
for
the
long
nights
he
has
passed
under
my
window
at
the
same
time
that
i
should
test
him
by
seeing
what
he
thinks
of
my
escapade
and
how
he
comports
himself
at
a
critical
moment
let
him
cast
a
halo
round
my
folly
behold
in
him
my
husband
let
him
show
one
iota
less
of
the
tremulous
respect
with
which
he
bows
to
me
in
the
farewell
don
felipe
as
for
society
i
run
less
risk
in
meeting
my
lover
thus
than
when
i
smile
to
him
in
the
of
mme
de
maufrigneuse
and
the
old
marquise
de
beauseant
where
spies
now
surround
us
on
every
side
and
heaven
only
knows
how
people
stare
at
the
girl
suspected
of
a
weakness
for
a
grotesque
like
macumer
i
can
not
tell
you
to
what
a
state
of
agitation
i
am
reduced
by
dreaming
of
this
idea
and
the
time
i
have
given
to
planning
its
execution
i
wanted
you
badly
what
happy
hours
we
should
have
chattered
away
lost
in
the
mazes
of
uncertainty
enjoying
in
anticipation
all
the
delights
and
horrors
of
a
first
meeting
in
the
silence
of
night
under
the
noble
of
the
chaulieu
mansion
with
the
moonlight
dancing
through
the
leaves
as
i
sat
alone
every
nerve
tingling
i
cried
oh
renee
where
are
you
then
your
letter
came
like
a
match
to
gunpowder
and
my
last
scruples
went
by
the
board
through
the
window
i
tossed
to
my
bewildered
adorer
an
exact
tracing
of
the
key
of
the
little
gate
at
the
end
of
the
garden
together
with
this
note
your
madness
must
really
be
put
a
stop
to
if
you
broke
your
neck
you
would
ruin
the
reputation
of
the
woman
you
profess
to
love
are
you
worthy
of
a
new
proof
of
regard
and
do
you
deserve
that
i
should
talk
with
you
under
the
limes
at
the
foot
of
the
garden
at
the
hour
when
the
moon
throws
them
into
shadow
yesterday
at
one
when
griffith
was
going
to
bed
i
said
to
her
take
your
shawl
dear
and
come
out
with
me
i
want
to
go
to
the
bottom
of
the
garden
without
anyone
knowing
without
a
word
she
followed
me
oh
my
renee
what
an
awful
moment
when
after
a
little
pause
full
of
delicious
thrills
of
agony
i
saw
him
gliding
along
like
a
shadow
when
he
had
reached
the
garden
safely
i
said
to
griffith
do
be
astonished
but
the
baron
de
macumer
is
here
and
indeed
it
is
on
that
account
i
brought
you
with
me
no
reply
from
griffith
what
would
you
have
with
me
said
felipe
in
a
tone
of
such
agitation
that
it
was
easy
to
see
he
was
driven
beside
himself
by
the
noise
slight
as
it
was
of
our
dresses
in
the
silence
of
the
night
and
of
our
steps
upon
the
gravel
i
want
to
say
to
you
what
i
could
not
write
i
replied
griffith
withdrew
a
few
steps
it
was
one
of
those
mild
nights
when
the
air
is
heavy
with
the
scent
of
flowers
my
head
swam
with
the
intoxicating
delight
of
finding
myself
all
but
alone
with
him
in
the
friendly
shade
of
the
beyond
which
lay
the
garden
shining
all
the
more
brightly
because
the
white
facade
of
the
house
reflected
the
moonlight
the
contrast
seemed
as
it
were
an
emblem
of
our
clandestine
love
leading
up
to
the
glaring
publicity
of
a
wedding
neither
of
us
could
do
more
at
first
than
drink
in
silently
the
ecstasy
of
a
moment
as
new
and
marvelous
for
him
as
for
me
at
last
i
found
tongue
to
say
pointing
to
the
although
i
am
not
afraid
of
scandal
you
shall
not
climb
that
tree
again
we
have
long
enough
played
schoolboy
and
schoolgirl
let
us
rise
now
to
the
height
of
our
destiny
had
that
fall
killed
you
i
should
have
died
disgraced
i
looked
at
him
every
scrap
of
color
had
left
his
face
and
if
you
had
been
found
there
suspicion
would
have
attached
either
to
my
mother
or
to
me
forgive
me
he
murmured
if
you
walk
along
the
boulevard
i
shall
hear
your
step
and
when
i
want
to
see
you
i
will
open
my
window
but
i
would
not
run
such
a
risk
unless
some
emergency
arose
why
have
you
forced
me
by
your
rash
act
to
commit
another
and
one
which
may
lower
me
in
your
eyes
the
tears
which
i
saw
in
his
eyes
were
to
me
the
most
eloquent
of
answers
what
i
have
done
i
went
on
with
a
smile
must
seem
to
you
the
height
of
madness
after
we
had
walked
up
and
down
in
silence
more
than
once
he
recovered
composure
enough
to
say
you
must
think
me
a
fool
and
indeed
the
delirium
of
my
joy
has
robbed
me
of
both
nerve
and
wits
but
of
this
at
least
be
assured
whatever
you
do
is
sacred
in
my
eyes
from
the
very
fact
that
it
seemed
right
to
you
i
honor
you
as
i
honor
only
god
besides
and
then
miss
griffith
is
here
she
is
here
for
the
sake
of
the
others
not
for
us
i
put
in
hastily
my
dear
he
understood
me
at
once
i
know
very
well
he
said
with
the
humblest
glance
at
me
that
whether
she
is
there
or
not
makes
no
difference
unseen
of
men
we
are
still
in
the
presence
of
god
and
our
own
esteem
is
not
less
important
to
us
than
that
of
the
world
thank
you
felipe
i
said
holding
out
my
hand
to
him
with
a
gesture
which
you
ought
to
see
a
woman
and
i
am
nothing
if
not
a
woman
is
on
the
road
to
loving
the
man
who
understands
her
oh
only
on
the
road
i
went
on
with
a
finger
on
my
lips
do
let
your
hopes
carry
you
beyond
what
i
say
my
heart
will
belong
only
to
the
man
who
can
read
it
and
know
its
every
turn
our
views
without
being
absolutely
identical
must
be
the
same
in
their
breadth
and
elevation
i
have
no
wish
to
exaggerate
my
own
merits
doubtless
what
seem
virtues
in
my
eyes
have
their
corresponding
defects
all
i
can
say
is
i
should
be
heartbroken
without
them
having
first
accepted
me
as
your
servant
you
now
permit
me
to
love
you
he
said
trembling
and
looking
in
my
face
at
each
word
my
first
prayer
has
been
more
than
answered
but
i
hastened
to
reply
your
position
seems
to
me
a
better
one
than
mine
i
should
not
object
to
change
places
and
this
change
it
lies
with
you
to
bring
about
in
my
turn
i
thank
you
he
replied
i
know
the
duties
of
a
faithful
lover
it
is
mine
to
prove
that
i
am
worthy
of
you
the
trials
shall
be
as
long
as
you
choose
to
make
them
if
i
belie
your
hopes
you
have
only
god
that
i
should
say
it
to
reject
me
i
know
that
you
love
me
i
replied
with
a
cruel
emphasis
on
the
words
you
stand
first
in
my
regard
otherwise
you
would
not
be
here
then
we
began
to
walk
up
and
down
as
we
talked
and
i
must
say
that
so
soon
as
my
spaniard
had
recovered
himself
he
put
forth
the
genuine
eloquence
of
the
heart
it
was
not
passion
it
breathed
but
a
marvelous
tenderness
of
feeling
which
he
beautifully
compared
to
the
divine
love
his
thrilling
voice
which
lent
an
added
charm
to
thoughts
in
themselves
so
exquisite
reminded
me
of
the
nightingale
note
he
spoke
low
using
only
the
middle
tones
of
a
fine
instrument
and
words
flowed
upon
words
with
the
rush
of
a
torrent
it
was
the
overflow
of
the
heart
no
more
i
said
or
i
shall
not
be
able
to
tear
myself
away
and
with
a
gesture
i
dismissed
him
you
have
committed
yourself
now
mademoiselle
said
griffith
in
england
that
might
be
so
but
not
in
france
i
replied
with
nonchalance
i
intend
to
make
a
love
match
and
am
feeling
my
way
that
is
all
you
see
dear
as
love
did
not
come
to
me
i
had
to
do
as
mahomet
did
with
the
mountain
friday
once
more
i
have
seen
my
slave
he
has
become
very
timid
and
puts
on
an
air
of
pious
devotion
which
i
like
for
it
seems
to
say
that
he
feels
my
power
and
fascination
in
every
fibre
but
nothing
in
his
look
or
manner
can
rouse
in
these
society
sibyls
any
suspicion
of
the
boundless
love
which
i
see
do
suppose
though
dear
that
i
am
carried
away
mastered
tamed
on
the
contrary
the
taming
mastering
and
carrying
away
are
on
my
side
in
short
i
am
quite
capable
of
reason
oh
to
feel
again
the
terror
of
that
fascination
in
which
i
was
held
by
the
schoolmaster
the
plebeian
the
man
i
kept
at
a
distance
the
fact
is
that
love
is
of
two
kinds
one
which
commands
and
one
which
obeys
the
two
are
quite
distinct
and
the
passion
to
which
the
one
gives
rise
is
not
the
passion
of
the
other
to
get
her
full
of
life
perhaps
a
woman
ought
to
have
experience
of
both
can
the
two
passions
ever
can
the
man
in
whom
we
inspire
love
inspire
it
in
us
will
the
day
ever
come
when
felipe
is
my
master
shall
i
tremble
then
as
he
does
now
these
are
questions
which
make
me
shudder
he
is
very
blind
in
his
place
i
should
have
thought
mlle
de
chaulieu
meeting
me
under
the
limes
a
cold
calculating
coquette
with
starched
manners
no
that
is
not
love
it
is
playing
with
fire
i
am
still
fond
of
felipe
but
i
am
calm
and
at
my
ease
with
him
now
no
more
obstacles
what
a
terrible
thought
it
is
all
within
and
i
fear
to
question
my
heart
his
mistake
was
in
concealing
the
ardor
of
his
love
he
ought
to
have
forced
my
in
a
word
i
was
naughty
and
i
have
not
got
the
reward
such
naughtiness
brings
no
dear
however
sweet
the
memory
of
that
beneath
the
trees
it
is
nothing
like
the
excitement
of
the
old
time
with
its
shall
i
go
shall
i
not
go
shall
i
write
to
him
shall
i
not
write
is
it
thus
with
all
our
pleasures
is
suspense
always
better
than
enjoyment
hope
than
fruition
is
it
the
rich
who
in
very
truth
are
the
poor
have
we
not
both
perhaps
exaggerated
feeling
by
giving
to
imagination
too
free
a
rein
there
are
times
when
this
thought
freezes
me
shall
i
tell
you
why
because
i
am
meditating
another
visit
to
the
bottom
of
the
garden
without
griffith
how
far
could
i
go
in
this
direction
imagination
knows
no
limit
but
it
is
not
so
with
pleasure
tell
me
dear
professor
how
can
one
reconcile
the
two
goals
of
a
woman
existence
xxii
louise
to
felipe
i
am
not
pleased
with
you
if
you
did
not
cry
over
racine
and
feel
it
to
be
the
most
terrible
of
tragedies
there
is
no
kinship
in
our
souls
we
shall
never
get
on
together
and
had
better
break
off
at
once
let
us
meet
no
more
forget
me
for
if
i
do
not
have
a
satisfactory
reply
i
shall
forget
you
you
will
become
le
baron
de
macumer
for
me
or
rather
you
will
cease
to
be
at
all
yesterday
at
mme
you
had
a
air
which
disgusted
me
no
doubt
apparently
about
your
conquest
in
sober
earnest
your
alarms
me
not
a
trace
in
you
of
the
humble
slave
of
your
first
letter
far
from
betraying
the
of
a
lover
you
polished
epigrams
this
is
not
the
attitude
of
a
true
believer
always
prostrate
before
his
divinity
if
you
do
not
feel
me
to
be
the
very
breath
of
your
life
a
being
nobler
than
other
women
and
to
be
judged
by
other
standards
then
i
must
be
less
than
a
woman
in
your
sight
you
have
roused
in
me
a
spirit
of
mistrust
felipe
and
its
angry
mutterings
have
drowned
the
accents
of
tenderness
when
i
look
back
upon
what
has
passed
between
us
i
feel
in
truth
that
i
have
a
right
to
be
suspicious
for
know
prime
minister
of
all
the
spains
that
i
have
reflected
much
on
the
defenceless
condition
of
our
sex
my
innocence
has
held
a
torch
and
my
fingers
are
not
burnt
let
me
repeat
to
you
then
what
my
youthful
experience
taught
me
in
all
other
matters
duplicity
faithlessness
and
broken
pledges
are
brought
to
book
and
punished
but
not
so
with
love
which
is
at
once
the
victim
the
accuser
the
counsel
judge
and
executioner
the
cruelest
treachery
the
most
heartless
crimes
are
those
which
remain
for
ever
concealed
with
two
hearts
alone
for
witness
how
indeed
should
the
victim
proclaim
them
without
injury
to
herself
love
therefore
has
its
own
code
its
own
penal
system
with
which
the
world
has
no
concern
now
for
my
part
i
have
resolved
never
to
pardon
a
serious
misdemeanor
and
in
love
pray
what
is
not
serious
yesterday
you
had
all
the
air
of
a
man
successful
in
his
suit
you
would
be
wrong
to
doubt
it
and
yet
if
this
assurance
robbed
you
of
the
charming
simplicity
which
sprang
from
uncertainty
i
should
blame
you
severely
i
would
have
you
neither
bashful
nor
i
would
not
have
you
in
terror
of
losing
my
affection
that
would
be
an
insult
but
neither
would
i
have
you
wear
your
love
lightly
as
a
thing
of
course
never
should
your
heart
be
freer
than
mine
if
you
know
nothing
of
the
torture
that
a
single
stab
of
doubt
brings
to
the
soul
tremble
lest
i
give
you
a
lesson
in
a
single
glance
i
confided
my
heart
to
you
and
you
read
the
meaning
the
purest
feelings
that
ever
took
root
in
a
young
girl
breast
are
yours
the
thought
and
meditation
of
which
i
have
told
you
served
only
to
enrich
the
mind
but
if
ever
the
wounded
heart
turns
to
the
brain
for
counsel
be
sure
the
young
girl
would
show
some
kinship
with
the
demon
of
knowledge
and
of
daring
i
swear
to
you
felipe
if
you
love
me
as
i
believe
you
do
and
if
i
have
reason
to
suspect
the
least
falling
off
in
the
fear
obedience
and
respect
which
you
have
hitherto
professed
if
the
pure
flame
of
passion
which
first
kindled
the
fire
of
my
heart
should
seem
to
me
any
day
to
burn
less
vividly
you
need
fear
no
reproaches
i
would
not
weary
you
with
letters
bearing
any
trace
of
weakness
pride
or
anger
nor
even
with
one
of
warning
like
this
but
if
i
spoke
no
words
felipe
my
face
would
tell
you
that
death
was
near
and
yet
i
should
not
die
till
i
had
branded
you
with
infamy
and
sown
eternal
sorrow
in
your
heart
you
would
see
the
girl
you
loved
dishonored
and
lost
in
this
world
and
know
her
doomed
to
everlasting
suffering
in
the
next
do
not
therefore
i
implore
you
give
me
cause
to
envy
the
old
happy
louise
the
object
of
your
pure
worship
whose
heart
expanded
in
the
sunshine
of
happiness
since
in
the
words
of
dante
she
possessed
senza
brama
sicura
ricchezza
i
have
searched
the
through
to
find
the
most
terrible
punishment
some
torture
of
the
mind
to
which
i
might
link
the
vengeance
of
god
yesterday
as
i
watched
you
doubt
went
through
me
like
a
sharp
cold
dagger
point
do
you
know
what
that
means
i
mistrusted
you
and
the
pang
was
so
terrible
i
could
not
endure
it
longer
if
my
service
be
too
hard
leave
it
i
would
not
keep
you
do
i
need
any
proof
of
your
cleverness
keep
for
me
the
flowers
of
your
wit
show
to
others
no
fine
surface
to
call
forth
flattery
compliments
or
praise
come
to
me
laden
with
hatred
or
scorn
the
butt
of
calumny
come
to
me
with
the
news
that
women
flout
you
and
ignore
you
and
not
one
loves
you
then
ah
then
you
will
know
the
treasures
of
louise
heart
and
love
we
are
only
rich
when
our
wealth
is
buried
so
deep
that
all
the
world
might
trample
it
under
foot
unknowing
if
you
were
handsome
i
suppose
i
should
have
looked
at
you
twice
or
discovered
one
of
the
thousand
reasons
out
of
which
my
love
sprang
true
we
know
no
more
of
these
reasons
than
we
know
why
it
is
the
sun
makes
the
flowers
to
bloom
and
ripens
the
fruit
yet
i
could
tell
you
of
one
reason
very
dear
to
me
the
character
expression
and
individuality
that
ennoble
your
face
are
a
sealed
book
to
all
but
me
mine
is
the
power
which
transforms
you
into
the
most
lovable
of
men
and
that
is
why
i
would
keep
your
mental
gifts
also
for
myself
to
others
they
should
be
as
meaningless
as
your
eyes
the
charm
of
your
mouth
and
features
let
it
be
mine
alone
to
kindle
the
beacon
of
your
intelligence
as
i
bring
the
lovelight
into
your
eyes
i
would
have
you
the
spanish
grandee
of
old
days
cold
ungracious
haughty
a
monument
to
be
gazed
at
from
afar
like
the
ruins
of
some
barbaric
power
which
no
one
ventures
to
explore
now
you
have
nothing
better
to
do
than
to
open
up
pleasant
promenades
for
the
public
and
show
yourself
of
a
parisian
affability
is
my
ideal
portrait
then
forgotten
your
excessive
cheerfulness
was
redolent
of
your
love
had
it
not
been
for
a
restraining
glance
from
me
you
would
have
proclaimed
to
the
most
and
unsparing
of
paris
salons
that
your
inspiration
was
drawn
from
de
chaulieu
i
believe
in
your
greatness
too
much
to
think
for
a
moment
that
your
love
is
ruled
by
policy
but
if
you
did
not
show
a
childlike
simplicity
when
with
me
i
could
only
pity
you
spite
of
this
first
fault
you
are
still
deeply
admired
by
louise
de
chaulieu
xxiii
felipe
to
louise
when
god
beholds
our
faults
he
sees
also
our
repentance
yes
my
beloved
mistress
you
are
right
i
felt
that
i
had
displeased
you
but
knew
not
how
now
that
you
have
explained
the
cause
of
your
trouble
i
find
in
it
fresh
motive
to
adore
you
like
the
god
of
israel
you
are
a
jealous
deity
and
i
rejoice
to
see
it
for
what
is
holier
and
more
precious
than
jealousy
my
fair
guardian
angel
jealousy
is
an
sentinel
it
is
to
love
what
pain
is
to
the
body
the
faithful
herald
of
evil
be
jealous
of
your
servant
louise
i
beg
of
you
the
harder
you
strike
the
more
contrite
will
he
be
and
kiss
the
rod
in
all
submission
which
proves
that
he
is
not
indifferent
to
you
but
alas
dear
if
the
pains
it
cost
me
to
vanquish
my
timidity
and
master
feelings
you
thought
so
feeble
were
invisible
to
you
will
heaven
think
you
reward
them
i
assure
you
it
needed
no
slight
effort
to
show
myself
to
you
as
i
was
in
the
days
before
i
loved
at
madrid
i
was
considered
a
good
talker
and
i
wanted
you
to
see
for
yourself
the
few
gifts
i
may
possess
if
this
were
vanity
it
has
been
well
punished
your
last
glance
utterly
unnerved
me
never
had
i
so
quailed
even
when
the
army
of
france
was
at
the
gates
of
cadiz
and
i
read
peril
for
my
life
in
the
dissembling
words
of
my
royal
master
vainly
i
tried
to
discover
the
cause
of
your
displeasure
and
the
lack
of
sympathy
between
us
which
this
fact
disclosed
was
terrible
to
me
for
in
truth
i
have
no
wish
but
to
act
by
your
will
think
your
thoughts
see
with
your
eyes
respond
to
your
joy
and
suffering
as
my
body
responds
to
heat
and
cold
the
crime
and
the
anguish
lay
for
me
in
the
breach
of
unison
in
that
common
life
of
feeling
which
you
have
made
so
fair
i
have
vexed
her
i
exclaimed
over
and
over
again
like
one
distraught
my
noble
my
beautiful
louise
if
anything
could
increase
the
fervor
of
my
devotion
or
confirm
my
belief
in
your
delicate
moral
intuitions
it
would
be
the
new
light
which
your
words
have
thrown
upon
my
own
feelings
much
in
them
of
which
my
mind
was
formerly
but
dimly
conscious
you
have
now
made
clear
if
this
be
designed
as
chastisement
what
can
be
the
sweetness
of
your
rewards
louise
for
me
it
was
happiness
enough
to
be
accepted
as
your
servant
you
have
given
me
the
life
of
which
i
despaired
no
longer
do
i
draw
a
useless
breath
i
have
something
to
spend
myself
for
my
force
has
an
outlet
if
only
in
suffering
for
you
once
more
i
say
as
i
have
said
before
that
you
will
never
find
me
other
than
i
was
when
first
i
offered
myself
as
your
lowly
bondman
yes
were
you
dishonored
and
lost
to
use
your
own
words
my
heart
would
only
cling
the
more
closely
to
you
for
your
misery
it
would
be
my
care
to
staunch
your
wounds
and
my
prayers
should
importune
god
with
the
story
of
your
innocence
and
your
wrongs
did
i
not
tell
you
that
the
feelings
of
my
heart
for
you
are
not
a
lover
only
that
i
will
be
to
you
father
mother
sister
brother
ay
a
whole
family
anything
or
nothing
as
you
may
decree
and
is
it
not
your
own
wish
which
has
confined
within
the
compass
of
a
lover
feeling
so
many
varying
forms
of
devotion
pardon
me
then
if
at
times
the
father
and
brother
disappear
behind
the
lover
since
you
know
they
are
none
the
less
there
though
screened
from
view
would
that
you
could
read
the
feelings
of
my
heart
when
you
appear
before
me
radiant
in
your
beauty
the
centre
of
admiring
eyes
reclining
calmly
in
your
carriage
in
the
or
seated
in
your
box
at
the
opera
then
would
you
know
how
absolutely
free
from
selfish
taint
is
the
pride
with
which
i
hear
the
praises
of
your
loveliness
and
grace
praises
which
warm
my
heart
even
to
the
strangers
who
utter
them
when
by
chance
you
have
raised
me
to
elysium
by
a
friendly
greeting
my
pride
is
mingled
with
humility
and
i
depart
as
though
god
blessing
rested
on
me
nor
does
the
joy
vanish
without
leaving
a
long
track
of
light
behind
it
breaks
on
me
through
the
clouds
of
my
cigarette
smoke
more
than
ever
do
i
feel
how
every
drop
of
this
surging
blood
throbs
for
you
can
you
be
ignorant
how
you
are
loved
after
seeing
you
i
return
to
my
study
and
the
glitter
of
its
saracenic
ornaments
sinks
to
nothing
before
the
brightness
of
your
portrait
when
i
open
the
spring
that
keeps
it
locked
up
from
every
eye
and
lose
myself
in
endless
musings
or
link
my
happiness
to
verse
from
the
heights
of
heaven
i
look
down
upon
the
course
of
a
life
such
as
my
hopes
dare
to
picture
it
have
you
never
in
the
silence
of
the
night
or
through
the
roar
of
the
town
heard
the
whisper
of
a
voice
in
your
sweet
dainty
ear
does
no
one
of
the
thousand
prayers
that
i
speed
to
you
reach
home
by
dint
of
silent
contemplation
of
your
pictured
face
i
have
succeeded
in
deciphering
the
expression
of
every
feature
and
tracing
its
connection
with
some
grace
of
the
spirit
and
then
i
pen
a
sonnet
to
you
in
spanish
on
the
harmony
of
the
twofold
beauty
in
which
nature
has
clothed
you
these
sonnets
you
will
never
see
for
my
poetry
is
too
unworthy
of
its
theme
i
dare
not
send
it
to
you
not
a
moment
passes
without
thoughts
of
you
for
my
whole
being
is
bound
up
in
you
and
if
you
ceased
to
be
its
animating
principle
every
part
would
ache
now
louise
can
you
realize
the
torture
to
me
of
knowing
that
i
had
displeased
you
while
entirely
ignorant
of
the
cause
the
ideal
double
life
which
seemed
so
fair
was
cut
short
my
heart
turned
to
ice
within
me
as
hopeless
of
any
other
explanation
i
concluded
that
you
had
ceased
to
love
me
with
heavy
heart
and
yet
not
wholly
without
comfort
i
was
falling
back
upon
my
old
post
as
servant
then
your
letter
came
and
turned
all
to
joy
oh
might
i
but
listen
for
ever
to
such
chiding
once
a
child
picking
himself
up
from
a
tumble
turned
to
his
mother
with
the
words
forgive
me
hiding
his
own
hurt
he
sought
pardon
for
the
pain
he
had
caused
her
louise
i
was
that
child
and
such
as
i
was
then
i
am
now
here
is
the
key
to
my
character
which
your
slave
in
all
humility
places
in
your
hands
but
do
not
fear
there
will
be
no
more
stumbling
keep
tight
the
chain
which
binds
me
to
you
so
that
a
touch
may
communicate
your
lightest
wish
to
him
who
will
ever
remain
your
slave
felipe
xxiv
louise
de
chaulieu
to
renee
de
october
my
dear
friend
how
is
it
possible
that
you
who
brought
yourself
in
two
months
to
marry
a
invalid
in
order
to
mother
him
should
know
anything
of
that
terrible
shifting
drama
enacted
in
the
recesses
of
the
heart
which
we
call
love
a
drama
where
death
lies
in
a
glance
or
a
light
reply
i
had
reserved
for
felipe
one
last
supreme
test
which
was
to
be
decisive
i
wanted
to
know
whether
his
love
was
the
love
of
a
royalist
for
his
king
who
can
do
no
wrong
why
should
the
loyalty
of
a
catholic
be
less
supreme
he
walked
with
me
a
whole
night
under
the
limes
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
and
not
a
shadow
of
suspicion
crossed
his
soul
next
day
he
loved
me
better
but
the
feeling
was
as
reverent
as
humble
as
regretful
as
ever
he
had
not
presumed
an
iota
oh
he
is
a
very
spaniard
a
very
abencerrage
he
scaled
my
wall
to
come
and
kiss
the
hand
which
in
the
darkness
i
reached
down
to
him
from
my
balcony
he
might
have
broken
his
neck
how
many
of
our
young
men
would
do
the
like
but
all
this
is
nothing
christians
suffer
the
horrible
pangs
of
martyrdom
in
the
hope
of
heaven
the
day
before
yesterday
i
took
aside
the
royal
at
the
court
of
spain
my
much
respected
father
and
said
to
him
with
a
smile
sir
some
of
your
friends
will
have
it
that
you
are
marrying
your
dear
armande
to
the
nephew
of
an
ambassador
who
has
been
very
anxious
for
this
connection
and
has
long
begged
for
it
also
that
the
arranges
for
his
nephew
to
succeed
on
his
death
to
his
enormous
fortune
and
his
title
and
bestows
on
the
young
couple
in
the
meantime
an
income
of
a
hundred
thousand
livres
on
the
bride
a
dowry
of
eight
hundred
thousand
francs
your
daughter
weeps
but
bows
to
the
unquestioned
authority
of
her
honored
parent
some
people
are
unkind
enough
to
say
that
behind
her
tears
she
conceals
a
worldly
and
ambitious
soul
now
we
are
going
to
the
gentleman
box
at
the
opera
and
le
baron
de
macumer
will
visit
us
there
macumer
needs
a
touch
of
the
spur
then
said
my
father
smiling
at
me
as
though
i
were
a
female
ambassador
you
mistake
clarissa
harlowe
for
figaro
i
cried
with
a
glance
of
scorn
and
mockery
when
you
see
me
with
my
right
hand
ungloved
you
will
give
the
lie
to
this
impertinent
gossip
and
will
mark
your
displeasure
at
it
i
may
make
my
mind
easy
about
your
future
you
have
no
more
got
a
girl
headpiece
than
jeanne
had
a
woman
heart
you
will
be
happy
you
will
love
nobody
and
will
allow
yourself
to
be
loved
this
was
too
much
i
burst
into
laughter
what
is
it
little
flirt
he
said
i
tremble
for
my
country
interests
and
seeing
him
look
quite
blank
i
added
at
madrid
you
have
no
idea
how
this
little
nun
has
learned
in
a
year
time
to
make
fun
of
her
father
he
said
to
the
duchess
armande
makes
light
of
everything
my
mother
replied
looking
me
in
the
face
what
do
you
mean
i
asked
why
you
are
not
even
afraid
of
rheumatism
on
these
damp
nights
she
said
with
another
meaning
glance
at
me
oh
i
answered
the
mornings
are
so
hot
the
duchess
looked
down
it
high
time
she
were
married
said
my
father
and
it
had
better
be
before
i
go
if
you
wish
it
i
replied
demurely
two
hours
later
my
mother
and
i
the
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse
and
mme
were
all
four
blooming
like
roses
in
the
front
of
the
box
i
had
seated
myself
sideways
giving
only
a
shoulder
to
the
house
so
that
i
could
see
everything
myself
unseen
in
that
spacious
box
which
fills
one
of
the
two
angles
at
the
back
of
the
hall
between
the
columns
macumer
came
stood
up
and
put
his
before
his
eyes
so
that
he
might
be
able
to
look
at
me
comfortably
in
the
first
interval
entered
the
young
man
whom
i
call
king
of
the
profligates
the
comte
henri
de
marsay
who
has
great
beauty
of
an
effeminate
kind
entered
the
box
with
an
epigram
in
his
eyes
a
smile
upon
his
lips
and
an
air
of
satisfaction
over
his
whole
countenance
he
first
greeted
my
mother
mme
and
the
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse
the
comte
and
de
canalis
then
turning
to
me
he
said
i
do
not
know
whether
i
shall
be
the
first
to
congratulate
you
on
an
event
which
will
make
you
the
object
of
envy
to
many
ah
a
marriage
i
cried
is
it
left
for
me
a
girl
fresh
from
the
convent
to
tell
you
that
predicted
marriages
never
come
off
de
marsay
bent
down
whispering
to
macumer
and
i
was
convinced
from
the
movement
of
his
lips
that
what
he
said
was
this
baron
you
are
perhaps
in
love
with
that
little
coquette
who
has
used
you
for
her
own
ends
but
as
the
question
is
one
not
of
love
but
of
marriage
it
is
as
well
for
you
to
know
what
is
going
on
macumer
treated
this
officious
to
one
of
those
glances
of
his
which
seem
to
me
so
eloquent
of
noble
scorn
and
replied
to
the
effect
that
he
was
not
in
love
with
any
little
coquette
his
whole
bearing
so
delighted
me
that
directly
i
caught
sight
of
my
father
the
glove
was
off
felipe
had
not
a
shadow
of
fear
or
doubt
how
well
did
he
bear
out
my
expectations
his
faith
is
only
in
me
society
can
not
hurt
him
with
its
lies
not
a
muscle
of
the
arab
face
stirred
not
a
drop
of
the
blue
blood
flushed
his
olive
cheek
the
two
young
counts
went
out
and
i
said
laughing
to
macumer
de
marsay
has
been
treating
you
to
an
epigram
on
me
he
did
more
he
replied
it
was
an
epithalamium
you
speak
greek
to
me
i
said
rewarding
him
with
a
smile
and
a
certain
look
which
always
embarrasses
him
my
father
meantime
was
talking
to
mme
de
maufrigneuse
i
should
think
so
he
exclaimed
the
gossip
which
gets
about
is
scandalous
no
sooner
has
a
girl
come
out
than
everyone
is
keen
to
marry
her
and
the
ridiculous
stories
that
are
invented
i
shall
never
force
armande
to
marry
against
her
will
i
am
going
to
take
a
turn
in
the
promenade
otherwise
people
will
be
saying
that
i
allowed
the
rumor
to
spread
in
order
to
suggest
the
marriage
to
the
ambassador
and
daughter
ought
to
be
above
suspicion
even
more
than
his
wife
if
that
were
possible
the
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse
and
mme
shot
glances
first
at
my
mother
then
at
the
baron
brimming
over
with
sly
intelligence
and
repressed
curiosity
with
their
serpent
cunning
they
had
at
last
got
an
inkling
of
something
going
on
of
all
mysteries
in
life
love
is
the
least
mysterious
it
exhales
from
women
i
believe
like
a
perfume
and
she
who
can
conceal
it
is
a
very
monster
our
eyes
prattle
even
more
than
our
tongues
having
enjoyed
the
delightful
sensation
of
finding
felipe
rise
to
the
occasion
as
i
had
wished
it
was
only
in
nature
i
should
hunger
for
more
so
i
made
the
signal
agreed
on
for
telling
him
that
he
might
come
to
my
window
by
the
dangerous
road
you
know
of
a
few
hours
later
i
found
him
upright
as
a
statue
glued
to
the
wall
his
hand
resting
on
the
balcony
of
my
window
studying
the
reflections
of
the
light
in
my
room
my
dear
felipe
i
said
you
have
acquitted
yourself
well
you
behaved
exactly
as
i
should
have
done
had
i
been
told
that
you
were
on
the
point
of
marrying
i
thought
he
replied
that
you
would
hardly
have
told
others
before
me
and
what
right
have
you
to
this
privilege
the
right
of
one
who
is
your
devoted
slave
in
very
truth
i
am
and
shall
ever
remain
so
but
suppose
this
marriage
was
inevitable
suppose
that
i
had
agreed
two
flashing
glances
lit
up
the
moonlight
one
directed
to
me
the
other
to
the
precipice
which
the
wall
made
for
us
he
seemed
to
calculate
whether
a
fall
together
would
mean
death
but
the
thought
merely
passed
like
lightning
over
his
face
and
sparkled
in
his
eyes
a
power
stronger
than
passion
checked
the
impulse
an
arab
can
not
take
back
his
word
he
said
in
a
husky
voice
i
am
your
slave
to
do
with
as
you
will
my
life
is
not
mine
to
destroy
the
hand
on
the
balcony
seemed
as
though
its
hold
were
relaxing
i
placed
mine
on
it
as
i
said
felipe
my
beloved
from
this
moment
i
am
your
wife
in
thought
and
will
go
in
the
morning
to
ask
my
father
for
my
hand
he
wishes
to
retain
my
fortune
but
if
you
promise
to
acknowledge
receipt
of
it
in
the
contract
his
consent
will
no
doubt
be
given
i
am
no
longer
armande
de
chaulieu
leave
me
at
once
no
breath
of
scandal
must
touch
louise
de
macumer
he
listened
with
blanched
face
and
trembling
limbs
then
like
a
flash
had
cleared
the
ten
feet
to
the
ground
in
safety
it
was
a
moment
of
agony
but
he
waved
his
hand
to
me
and
disappeared
i
am
loved
then
i
said
to
myself
as
never
woman
was
before
and
i
fell
asleep
in
the
calm
content
of
a
child
my
destiny
for
ever
fixed
about
two
next
day
my
father
summoned
me
to
his
private
room
where
i
found
the
duchess
and
macumer
there
was
an
interchange
of
civilities
i
replied
quite
simply
that
if
my
father
and
henarez
were
of
one
mind
i
had
no
reason
to
oppose
their
wishes
thereupon
my
mother
invited
the
baron
to
dinner
and
after
dinner
we
all
four
went
for
a
drive
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
where
i
had
the
pleasure
of
smiling
ironically
to
de
marsay
as
he
passed
on
horseback
and
caught
sight
of
macumer
sitting
opposite
to
us
beside
my
father
my
bewitching
felipe
has
had
his
cards
reprinted
as
follows
henarez
baron
de
macumer
formerly
duc
de
soria
every
morning
he
brings
me
with
his
own
hands
a
splendid
bouquet
hidden
in
which
i
never
fail
to
find
a
letter
containing
a
spanish
sonnet
in
my
honor
which
he
has
composed
during
the
night
not
to
make
this
letter
inordinately
large
i
send
you
as
specimens
only
the
first
and
last
of
these
sonnets
which
i
have
translated
for
your
benefit
word
for
word
and
line
for
line
first
sonnet
many
a
time
i
stood
clad
in
thin
silken
vest
drawn
sword
in
hand
with
steady
pulse
waiting
the
charge
of
a
raging
bull
and
the
thrust
of
his
horn
than
phoebe
crescent
i
scaled
on
my
lips
the
lilt
of
an
andalusian
dance
the
steep
redoubt
under
a
rain
of
fire
i
staked
my
life
upon
a
hazard
of
the
dice
careless
as
though
it
were
a
gold
doubloon
my
hand
would
seek
the
ball
out
of
the
cannon
mouth
but
now
meseems
i
grow
more
timid
than
a
crouching
hair
or
a
child
spying
some
ghost
in
the
curtain
folds
for
when
your
sweet
eye
rests
on
me
any
icy
sweat
covers
my
brow
my
knees
give
way
i
tremble
shrink
my
courage
gone
second
sonnet
last
night
i
fain
would
sleep
to
dream
of
thee
but
jealous
sleep
fled
my
eyelids
i
sought
the
balcony
and
looked
towards
heaven
always
my
glance
flies
upward
when
i
think
of
thee
strange
sight
whose
meaning
love
alone
can
tell
the
sky
had
lost
its
sapphire
hue
the
stars
dulled
diamonds
in
their
golden
mount
twinkled
no
more
nor
shed
their
warmth
the
moon
washed
of
her
silver
radiance
hung
mourning
over
the
gloomy
plain
for
thou
hast
robbed
the
heavens
of
all
that
made
them
bright
the
snowy
sparkle
of
the
moon
is
on
thy
lovely
brow
heaven
azure
centres
in
thine
eyes
thy
lashes
fall
like
starry
rays
what
more
gracious
way
of
saying
to
a
young
girl
that
she
fills
your
life
tell
me
what
you
think
of
this
love
which
expends
itself
in
lavishing
the
treasures
alike
of
the
earth
and
of
the
soul
only
within
the
last
ten
days
have
i
grasped
the
meaning
of
that
spanish
gallantry
so
famous
in
old
days
ah
me
dear
what
is
going
on
now
at
la
crampade
how
often
do
i
take
a
stroll
there
inspecting
the
growth
of
our
crops
have
you
no
news
to
give
of
our
mulberry
trees
our
last
winter
plantations
does
everything
prosper
as
you
wish
and
while
the
buds
are
opening
on
our
shrubs
i
will
not
venture
to
speak
of
the
plants
have
they
also
blossomed
in
the
bosom
of
the
wife
does
louis
continue
his
policy
of
madrigals
do
you
enter
into
each
other
thoughts
i
wonder
whether
your
little
runlet
of
wedding
peace
is
better
than
the
raging
torrent
of
my
love
has
my
sweet
lady
professor
taken
offence
i
can
not
believe
it
and
if
it
were
so
i
should
send
felipe
off
at
once
to
fling
himself
at
her
knees
and
bring
back
to
me
my
pardon
or
her
head
sweet
love
my
life
here
is
a
splendid
success
and
i
want
to
know
how
it
fares
with
life
in
provence
we
have
just
increased
our
family
by
the
addition
of
a
spaniard
with
the
complexion
of
a
havana
cigar
and
your
congratulations
still
tarry
seriously
my
sweet
renee
i
am
anxious
i
am
afraid
lest
you
should
be
eating
your
heart
out
in
silence
for
fear
of
casting
a
gloom
over
my
sunshine
write
to
me
at
once
naughty
child
and
tell
me
your
life
in
its
every
minutest
detail
tell
me
whether
you
still
hold
back
whether
your
independence
still
stands
erect
or
has
fallen
on
its
knees
or
is
sitting
down
comfortably
which
would
indeed
be
serious
can
you
suppose
that
the
incidents
of
your
married
life
are
without
interest
for
me
i
muse
at
times
over
all
that
you
have
said
to
me
often
when
at
the
opera
i
seem
absorbed
in
watching
the
pirouetting
dancers
i
am
saying
to
myself
it
is
nine
perhaps
she
is
in
bed
what
is
she
about
is
she
happy
is
she
alone
with
her
independence
or
has
her
independence
gone
the
way
of
other
dead
and
castoff
independences
a
thousand
loves
xxv
renee
de
to
louise
de
chaulieu
saucy
girl
why
should
i
write
what
could
i
say
whilst
your
life
is
varied
by
social
festivities
as
well
as
by
the
anguish
the
tempers
and
the
flowers
of
love
all
of
which
you
describe
so
graphically
that
i
might
be
watching
some
acting
at
the
theatre
mine
is
as
monotonous
and
regular
as
though
it
were
passed
in
a
convent
we
always
go
to
bed
at
nine
and
get
up
with
daybreak
our
meals
are
served
with
a
maddening
punctuality
nothing
ever
happens
i
have
accustomed
myself
without
much
difficulty
to
this
mapping
out
of
the
day
which
perhaps
is
after
all
in
the
nature
of
things
where
would
the
life
of
the
universe
be
but
for
that
subjection
to
fixed
laws
which
according
to
the
astronomers
so
louis
tells
me
rule
the
spheres
it
is
not
order
of
which
we
weary
then
i
have
laid
upon
myself
certain
rules
of
dress
and
these
occupy
my
time
in
the
mornings
i
hold
it
part
of
my
duty
as
a
wife
to
look
as
charming
as
possible
i
feel
a
certain
satisfaction
in
it
and
it
causes
lively
pleasure
to
the
good
old
man
and
to
louis
after
lunch
we
walk
when
the
newspapers
arrive
i
disappear
to
look
after
my
household
affairs
or
to
read
for
i
read
a
great
deal
or
to
write
to
you
i
come
back
to
the
others
an
hour
before
dinner
and
after
dinner
we
play
cards
or
receive
visits
or
pay
them
thus
my
days
pass
between
a
contented
old
man
who
has
done
with
passions
and
the
man
who
owes
his
happiness
to
me
louis
happiness
is
so
radiant
that
it
has
at
last
warmed
my
heart
for
women
happiness
no
doubt
can
not
consist
in
the
mere
satisfaction
of
desire
sometimes
in
the
evening
when
i
am
not
required
to
take
a
hand
in
the
game
and
can
sink
back
in
my
armchair
imagination
bears
me
on
its
strong
wings
into
the
very
heart
of
your
life
then
its
riches
its
changeful
tints
its
surging
passions
become
my
own
and
i
ask
myself
to
what
end
such
a
stormy
preface
can
lead
may
i
not
swallow
up
the
book
itself
for
you
my
darling
the
illusions
of
love
are
possible
for
me
only
the
facts
of
homely
life
remain
yes
your
love
seems
to
me
a
dream
therefore
i
find
it
hard
to
understand
why
you
are
determined
to
throw
so
much
romance
over
it
your
ideal
man
must
have
more
soul
than
fire
more
nobility
and
than
passion
you
persist
in
trying
to
clothe
in
living
form
the
dream
ideal
of
a
girl
on
the
threshold
of
life
you
demand
sacrifices
for
the
pleasure
of
rewarding
them
you
submit
your
felipe
to
tests
in
order
to
ascertain
whether
desire
hope
and
curiosity
are
enduring
in
their
nature
but
child
behind
all
your
fantastic
stage
scenery
rises
the
altar
where
everlasting
bonds
are
forged
the
very
morrow
of
your
marriage
the
graceful
structure
raised
by
your
subtle
strategy
may
fall
before
that
terrible
reality
which
makes
of
a
girl
a
woman
of
a
gallant
a
husband
remember
that
there
is
not
exemption
for
lovers
for
them
as
for
ordinary
folk
like
louis
and
me
there
lurks
beneath
the
wedding
rejoicings
the
great
perhaps
of
rabelais
i
do
not
blame
you
though
of
course
it
was
rash
for
talking
with
felipe
in
the
garden
or
for
spending
a
night
with
him
you
on
your
balcony
he
on
his
wall
but
you
make
a
plaything
of
life
and
i
am
afraid
that
life
may
some
day
turn
the
tables
i
dare
not
give
you
the
counsel
which
my
own
experience
would
suggest
but
let
me
repeat
once
more
from
the
seclusion
of
my
valley
that
the
viaticum
of
married
life
lies
in
these
words
resignation
and
for
spite
of
all
your
tests
your
coyness
and
your
vigilance
i
can
see
that
marriage
will
mean
to
you
what
it
has
been
to
me
the
greater
the
passion
the
steeper
the
precipice
we
have
hewn
for
our
fall
that
is
the
only
difference
oh
what
i
would
give
to
see
the
baron
de
macumer
and
talk
with
him
for
an
hour
or
two
your
happiness
lies
so
near
my
heart
xxvi
louise
de
macumer
to
renee
de
march
as
felipe
has
carried
out
with
a
truly
saracenic
generosity
the
wishes
of
my
father
and
mother
in
acknowledging
the
fortune
he
has
not
received
from
me
the
duchess
has
become
even
more
friendly
to
me
than
before
she
calls
me
little
little
woman
of
the
world
and
says
i
know
how
to
use
my
tongue
but
dear
mamma
i
said
to
her
the
evening
before
the
contract
was
signed
you
attribute
to
cunning
and
smartness
on
my
part
what
is
really
the
outcome
of
the
truest
simplest
most
unselfish
most
devoted
love
that
ever
was
i
assure
you
that
i
am
not
at
all
the
of
the
world
you
do
me
the
honor
of
believing
me
to
be
come
come
armande
she
said
putting
her
arm
on
my
neck
and
drawing
me
to
her
in
order
to
kiss
my
forehead
you
did
not
want
to
go
back
to
the
convent
you
did
not
want
to
die
an
old
maid
and
like
a
fine
chaulieu
as
you
are
you
recognized
the
necessity
of
building
up
your
father
family
the
duke
was
listening
if
you
knew
renee
what
flattery
lies
for
him
in
these
words
i
have
watched
you
during
the
whole
winter
poking
your
little
nose
into
all
that
goes
on
forming
very
sensible
opinions
about
men
and
the
present
state
of
society
in
france
and
you
have
picked
out
the
one
spaniard
capable
of
giving
you
the
splendid
position
of
a
woman
who
reigns
supreme
in
her
own
house
my
little
girl
you
treated
him
exactly
as
tullia
treats
your
brother
what
lessons
they
give
in
my
sister
convent
exclaimed
my
father
a
glance
at
my
father
cut
him
short
at
once
then
turning
to
the
duchess
i
said
madame
i
love
my
future
husband
felipe
de
soria
with
all
the
strength
of
my
soul
although
this
love
sprang
up
without
my
knowledge
and
though
i
fought
it
stoutly
when
it
first
made
itself
felt
i
swear
to
you
that
i
never
gave
way
to
it
till
i
had
recognized
in
the
baron
de
macumer
a
character
worthy
of
mine
a
heart
of
which
the
delicacy
the
generosity
the
devotion
and
the
temper
are
suited
to
my
own
but
my
dear
she
began
interrupting
me
he
is
as
ugly
as
as
anything
you
like
i
retorted
quickly
but
i
love
his
ugliness
if
you
love
him
armande
said
my
father
and
have
the
strength
to
master
your
love
you
must
not
risk
your
happiness
now
happiness
in
marriage
depends
largely
on
the
first
days
days
only
interrupted
my
mother
then
with
a
glance
at
my
father
she
continued
you
had
better
leave
us
my
dear
to
have
our
talk
together
you
are
to
be
married
dear
child
the
duchess
then
began
in
a
low
voice
in
three
days
it
becomes
my
duty
therefore
without
silly
whimpering
which
would
be
unfitting
our
rank
in
life
to
give
you
the
serious
advice
which
every
mother
owes
to
her
daughter
you
are
marrying
a
man
whom
you
love
and
there
is
no
reason
why
i
should
pity
you
or
myself
i
have
only
known
you
for
a
year
and
if
this
period
has
been
long
enough
for
me
to
learn
to
love
you
it
is
hardly
sufficient
to
justify
floods
of
tears
at
the
idea
of
losing
you
your
mental
gifts
are
even
more
remarkable
than
those
of
your
person
you
have
gratified
maternal
pride
and
have
shown
yourself
a
sweet
and
loving
daughter
i
in
my
turn
can
promise
you
that
you
will
always
find
a
staunch
friend
in
your
mother
you
smile
alas
it
too
often
happens
that
a
mother
who
has
lived
on
excellent
terms
with
her
daughter
as
long
as
the
daughter
is
a
mere
girl
comes
to
cross
purposes
with
her
when
they
are
both
women
together
it
is
your
happiness
which
i
want
so
listen
to
my
words
the
love
which
you
now
feel
is
that
of
a
young
girl
and
is
natural
to
us
all
for
it
is
woman
destiny
to
cling
to
a
man
unhappily
pretty
one
there
is
but
one
man
in
the
world
for
a
woman
and
sometimes
this
man
whom
fate
has
marked
out
for
us
is
not
the
one
whom
we
mistaking
a
passing
fancy
for
love
choose
as
husband
strange
as
what
i
say
may
appear
to
you
it
is
worth
noting
if
we
can
not
love
the
man
we
have
chosen
the
fault
is
not
exclusively
ours
it
lies
with
both
or
sometimes
with
circumstances
over
which
we
have
no
control
yet
there
is
no
reason
why
the
man
chosen
for
us
by
our
family
the
man
to
whom
our
fancy
has
gone
out
should
not
be
the
man
whom
we
can
love
the
barriers
which
arise
later
between
husband
and
wife
are
often
due
to
lack
of
perseverance
on
both
sides
the
task
of
transforming
a
husband
into
a
lover
is
not
less
delicate
than
that
other
task
of
making
a
husband
of
the
lover
in
which
you
have
just
proved
yourself
marvelously
successful
i
repeat
it
your
happiness
is
my
object
never
allow
yourself
then
to
forget
that
the
first
three
months
of
your
married
life
may
work
your
misery
if
you
do
not
submit
to
the
yoke
with
the
same
forbearance
tenderness
and
intelligence
that
you
have
shown
during
the
days
of
courtship
for
my
little
rogue
you
know
very
well
that
you
have
indulged
in
all
the
innocent
pleasures
of
a
clandestine
love
affair
if
the
culmination
of
your
love
begins
with
disappointment
dislike
nay
even
with
pain
well
come
and
tell
me
about
it
do
hope
for
too
much
from
marriage
at
first
it
will
perhaps
give
you
more
discomfort
than
joy
the
happiness
of
your
life
requires
at
least
as
patient
cherishing
as
the
early
shoots
of
love
to
conclude
if
by
chance
you
should
lose
the
lover
you
will
find
in
his
place
the
father
of
your
children
in
this
my
dear
child
lies
the
whole
secret
of
social
life
sacrifice
everything
to
the
man
whose
name
you
bear
the
man
whose
honor
and
reputation
can
not
suffer
in
the
least
degree
without
involving
you
in
frightful
consequences
such
sacrifice
is
thus
not
only
an
absolute
duty
for
women
of
our
rank
it
is
also
their
wisest
policy
this
indeed
is
the
distinctive
mark
of
great
moral
principles
that
they
hold
good
and
are
expedient
from
whatever
aspect
they
are
viewed
but
i
need
say
no
more
to
you
on
this
point
i
fancy
you
are
of
a
jealous
disposition
and
my
dear
if
you
knew
how
jealous
i
am
but
you
must
not
be
stupid
over
it
to
publish
your
jealousy
to
the
world
is
like
playing
at
politics
with
your
cards
upon
the
table
and
those
who
let
their
own
game
be
seen
learn
nothing
of
their
opponents
whatever
happens
we
must
know
how
to
suffer
in
silence
she
added
that
she
intended
having
some
plain
talk
about
me
with
macumer
the
evening
before
the
wedding
raising
my
mother
beautiful
arm
i
kissed
her
hand
and
dropped
on
it
a
tear
which
the
tone
of
real
feeling
in
her
voice
had
brought
to
my
eyes
in
the
advice
she
had
given
me
i
read
high
principle
worthy
of
herself
and
of
me
true
wisdom
and
a
tenderness
of
heart
unspoilt
by
the
narrow
code
of
society
above
all
i
saw
that
she
understood
my
character
these
few
simple
words
summed
up
the
lessons
which
life
and
experience
had
brought
her
perhaps
at
a
heavy
price
she
was
moved
and
said
as
she
looked
at
me
dear
little
girl
you
got
a
nasty
crossing
before
you
and
most
women
in
their
ignorance
or
their
disenchantment
are
as
wise
as
the
earl
of
westmoreland
we
both
laughed
but
i
must
explain
the
joke
the
evening
before
a
russian
princess
had
told
us
an
anecdote
of
this
gentleman
he
had
suffered
frightfully
from
in
crossing
the
channel
and
turned
tail
when
he
got
near
italy
because
he
had
heard
some
one
speak
of
crossing
the
alps
thank
you
i
had
quite
enough
crossings
already
he
said
you
will
understand
renee
that
your
gloomy
philosophy
and
my
lecture
were
calculated
to
revive
the
fears
which
used
to
disturb
us
at
blois
the
nearer
marriage
approached
the
more
did
i
need
to
summon
all
my
strength
my
resolution
and
my
affection
to
face
this
terrible
passage
from
maidenhood
to
womanhood
all
our
conversations
came
back
to
my
mind
i
your
letters
and
discerned
in
them
a
vague
undertone
of
sadness
this
anxiety
had
one
advantage
at
least
it
helped
me
to
the
regulation
expression
for
a
bride
as
commonly
depicted
the
consequence
was
that
on
the
day
of
signing
the
contract
everybody
said
i
looked
charming
and
quite
the
right
thing
this
morning
at
the
mairie
it
was
an
informal
business
and
only
the
witnesses
were
present
i
am
writing
this
tail
to
my
letter
while
they
are
putting
out
my
dress
for
dinner
we
shall
be
married
at
midnight
at
the
church
of
after
a
very
gay
evening
i
confess
that
my
fears
give
me
a
and
modest
air
to
which
i
have
no
right
but
which
will
be
admired
why
i
can
not
conceive
i
am
delighted
to
see
that
poor
felipe
is
every
whit
as
timorous
as
i
am
society
grates
on
him
he
is
like
a
bat
in
a
glass
shop
thank
heaven
the
day
wo
last
for
ever
he
whispered
to
me
in
all
innocence
in
his
bashfulness
and
timidity
he
would
have
liked
to
have
no
one
there
the
sardinian
ambassador
when
he
came
to
sign
the
contract
took
me
aside
in
order
to
present
me
with
a
pearl
necklace
linked
together
by
six
splendid
diamonds
a
gift
from
my
the
duchess
de
soria
along
with
the
necklace
was
a
sapphire
bracelet
on
the
under
side
of
which
were
engraved
the
words
unknown
two
charming
letters
came
with
these
presents
which
however
i
could
not
accept
without
consulting
felipe
for
i
said
i
should
not
like
to
see
you
wearing
ornaments
that
came
from
any
one
but
me
he
kissed
my
hand
quite
moved
and
replied
wear
them
for
the
sake
of
the
inscription
and
also
for
the
kind
feeling
which
is
sincere
saturday
evening
here
then
my
poor
renee
are
the
last
words
of
your
girl
friend
after
the
midnight
mass
we
set
off
for
an
estate
which
felipe
with
kind
thought
for
me
has
bought
in
nivernais
on
the
way
to
provence
already
my
name
is
louise
de
macumer
but
i
leave
paris
in
a
few
hours
as
louise
de
chaulieu
however
i
am
called
there
will
never
be
for
you
but
one
louise
xxvii
the
same
to
the
same
october
i
have
not
written
to
you
dear
since
our
marriage
nearly
eight
months
ago
and
not
a
line
from
you
madame
you
are
inexcusable
to
begin
with
we
set
off
in
a
for
the
castle
of
chantepleurs
the
property
which
macumer
has
bought
in
nivernais
it
stands
on
the
banks
of
the
loire
sixty
leagues
from
paris
our
servants
with
the
exception
of
my
maid
were
there
before
us
and
we
arrived
after
a
very
rapid
journey
the
next
evening
i
slept
all
the
way
from
paris
to
beyond
montargis
my
lord
and
master
put
his
arm
round
me
and
pillowed
my
head
on
his
shoulder
upon
an
arrangement
of
handkerchiefs
this
was
the
one
liberty
he
took
and
the
almost
motherly
tenderness
which
got
the
better
of
his
drowsiness
touched
me
strangely
i
fell
asleep
then
under
the
fire
of
his
eyes
and
awoke
to
find
them
still
blazing
the
passionate
gaze
remained
unchanged
but
what
thoughts
had
come
and
gone
meanwhile
twice
he
had
kissed
me
on
the
forehead
at
briare
we
had
breakfast
in
the
carriage
then
followed
a
talk
like
our
old
talks
at
blois
while
the
same
loire
we
used
to
admire
called
forth
our
praises
and
at
seven
we
entered
the
noble
long
avenue
of
acacias
sycamores
and
larches
which
leads
to
chantepleurs
at
eight
we
dined
at
ten
we
were
in
our
bedroom
a
charming
gothic
room
made
comfortable
with
every
modern
luxury
felipe
who
is
thought
so
ugly
seemed
to
me
quite
beautiful
in
his
graceful
kindness
and
the
exquisite
delicacy
of
his
affection
of
passion
not
a
trace
all
through
the
journey
he
might
have
been
an
old
friend
of
fifteen
years
standing
later
he
has
described
to
me
with
all
the
vivid
touches
of
his
first
letter
the
furious
storms
that
raged
within
and
were
not
allowed
to
ruffle
the
outer
surface
so
far
i
have
found
nothing
very
terrible
in
marriage
i
said
as
i
walked
to
the
window
and
looked
out
on
the
glorious
moon
which
lit
up
a
charming
park
breathing
of
heavy
scents
he
drew
near
put
his
arm
again
round
me
and
said
why
fear
it
have
i
ever
yet
proved
false
to
my
promise
in
gesture
or
look
why
should
i
be
false
in
the
future
yet
never
were
words
or
glances
more
full
of
mastery
his
voice
thrilled
every
fibre
of
my
heart
and
roused
a
sleeping
force
his
eyes
were
like
the
sun
in
power
oh
i
exclaimed
what
a
world
of
moorish
perfidy
in
this
attitude
of
perpetual
prostration
he
understood
my
dear
so
my
fair
sweetheart
if
i
have
let
months
slip
by
without
writing
you
can
now
divine
the
cause
i
have
to
recall
the
girl
strange
past
in
order
to
explain
the
woman
to
myself
renee
i
understand
you
now
not
to
her
dearest
friend
not
to
her
mother
not
perhaps
even
to
herself
can
a
happy
bride
speak
of
her
happiness
this
memory
ought
to
remain
absolutely
her
own
an
added
rapture
a
thing
beyond
words
too
sacred
for
disclosure
is
it
possible
that
the
name
of
duty
has
been
given
to
the
delicious
frenzy
of
the
heart
to
the
overwhelming
rush
of
passion
and
for
what
purpose
what
malevolent
power
conceived
the
idea
of
crushing
a
sensitive
delicacy
and
all
the
thousand
wiles
of
her
modesty
under
the
fetters
of
constraint
what
sense
of
duty
can
force
from
her
these
flowers
of
the
heart
the
roses
of
life
the
passionate
poetry
of
her
nature
apart
from
love
to
claim
feeling
as
a
right
why
it
blooms
of
itself
under
the
sun
of
love
and
shrivels
to
death
under
the
cold
blast
of
distaste
and
aversion
let
love
guard
his
own
rights
oh
my
noble
renee
i
understand
you
now
i
bow
to
your
greatness
amazed
at
the
depth
and
clearness
of
your
insight
yes
the
woman
who
has
not
used
the
marriage
ceremony
as
i
have
done
merely
to
legalize
and
publish
the
secret
election
of
her
heart
has
nothing
left
but
to
fly
to
motherhood
when
earth
fails
the
soul
makes
for
heaven
one
hard
truth
emerges
from
all
that
you
have
said
only
men
who
are
really
great
know
how
to
love
and
now
i
understand
the
reason
of
this
man
obeys
two
forces
one
sensual
one
spiritual
weak
or
inferior
men
mistake
the
first
for
the
last
whilst
great
souls
know
how
to
clothe
the
merely
natural
instinct
in
all
the
graces
of
the
spirit
the
very
strength
of
this
spiritual
passion
imposes
severe
and
inspires
them
with
reverence
for
women
clearly
feeling
is
sensitive
in
proportion
to
the
calibre
of
the
mental
powers
generally
and
this
is
why
the
man
of
genius
alone
has
something
of
a
woman
delicacy
he
understands
and
divines
woman
and
the
wings
of
passion
on
which
he
raises
her
are
restrained
by
the
timidity
of
the
sensitive
spirit
but
when
the
mind
the
heart
and
the
senses
all
have
their
share
in
the
rapture
which
transports
us
ah
then
there
is
no
falling
to
earth
rather
it
is
to
heaven
we
soar
alas
for
only
too
brief
a
visit
such
dear
soul
is
the
philosophy
of
the
first
three
months
of
my
married
life
felipe
is
angelic
without
figure
of
speech
he
is
another
self
and
i
can
think
aloud
with
him
his
greatness
of
soul
passes
my
comprehension
possession
only
attaches
him
more
closely
to
me
and
he
discovers
in
his
happiness
new
motives
for
loving
me
for
him
i
am
the
nobler
part
of
himself
i
can
foresee
that
years
of
wedded
life
far
from
impairing
his
affection
will
only
make
it
more
assured
develop
fresh
possibilities
of
enjoyment
and
bind
us
in
more
perfect
sympathy
what
a
delirium
of
joy
it
is
part
of
my
nature
that
pleasure
has
an
exhilarating
effect
on
me
it
leaves
sunshine
behind
and
becomes
a
part
of
my
inner
being
the
interval
which
parts
one
ecstasy
from
another
is
like
the
short
night
which
marks
off
our
long
summer
days
the
sun
which
flushed
the
mountain
tops
with
warmth
in
setting
finds
them
hardly
cold
when
it
rises
what
happy
chance
has
given
me
such
a
destiny
my
mother
had
roused
a
host
of
fears
in
me
her
forecast
which
though
free
from
the
alloy
of
vulgar
pettiness
seemed
to
me
redolent
of
jealousy
has
been
falsified
by
the
event
your
fears
and
hers
my
own
all
have
vanished
in
thin
air
we
remained
at
chantepleurs
seven
months
and
a
half
for
all
the
world
like
a
couple
of
runaway
lovers
fleeing
the
parental
warmth
while
the
roses
of
pleasure
crowned
our
love
and
embellished
our
dual
solitude
one
morning
when
i
was
even
happier
than
usual
i
began
to
muse
over
my
lot
and
suddenly
renee
and
her
prosaic
marriage
flashed
into
my
mind
it
seemed
to
me
that
now
i
could
grasp
the
inner
meaning
in
your
life
oh
my
sweet
why
do
we
speak
a
different
tongue
your
marriage
of
convenience
and
my
love
match
are
two
worlds
as
widely
separated
as
the
finite
from
infinity
you
still
walk
the
earth
whilst
i
range
the
heavens
your
sphere
is
human
mine
divine
love
crowned
me
queen
you
reign
by
reason
and
duty
so
lofty
are
the
regions
where
i
soar
that
a
fall
would
shiver
me
to
atoms
but
no
more
of
this
i
shrink
from
painting
to
you
the
rainbow
brightness
the
profusion
the
exuberant
joy
of
love
springtime
as
we
know
it
for
ten
days
we
have
been
in
paris
staying
in
a
charming
house
in
the
rue
du
bac
prepared
for
us
by
the
architect
to
whom
felipe
intrusted
the
decoration
of
chantepleurs
i
have
been
listening
in
all
the
full
content
of
an
assured
and
sanctioned
love
to
that
divine
music
of
rossini
which
used
to
soothe
me
when
as
a
restless
girl
i
hungered
vaguely
after
experience
they
say
i
am
more
beautiful
and
i
have
a
childish
pleasure
in
hearing
myself
called
madame
friday
morning
renee
my
fair
saint
the
happiness
of
my
own
life
pulls
me
for
ever
back
to
you
i
feel
that
i
can
be
more
to
you
than
ever
before
you
are
so
dear
to
me
i
have
studied
your
wedded
life
closely
in
the
light
of
my
own
opening
chapters
and
you
seem
to
me
to
come
out
of
the
scrutiny
so
great
so
noble
so
splendid
in
your
goodness
that
i
here
declare
myself
your
inferior
and
humble
admirer
as
well
as
your
friend
when
i
think
what
marriage
has
been
to
me
it
seems
to
me
that
i
should
have
died
had
it
turned
out
otherwise
and
you
live
tell
me
what
your
heart
feeds
on
never
again
shall
i
make
fun
of
you
mockery
my
sweet
is
the
child
of
ignorance
we
jest
at
what
we
know
nothing
of
recruits
will
laugh
where
the
veteran
soldier
looks
grave
was
a
remark
made
to
me
by
the
comte
de
chaulieu
that
poor
cavalry
officer
whose
campaigning
so
far
has
consisted
in
marches
from
paris
to
fontainebleau
and
back
again
i
surmise
too
my
dear
love
that
you
have
not
told
me
all
there
are
wounds
which
you
have
hidden
you
suffer
i
am
convinced
of
it
in
trying
to
make
out
at
this
distance
and
from
the
scraps
you
tell
me
the
reasons
of
your
conduct
i
have
weaved
together
all
sorts
of
romantic
theories
about
you
she
has
made
a
mere
experiment
in
marriage
i
thought
one
evening
and
what
is
happiness
for
me
had
proved
only
suffering
to
her
her
sacrifice
is
barren
of
reward
and
she
would
not
make
it
greater
than
need
be
the
unctuous
axioms
of
social
morality
are
only
used
to
cloak
her
disappointment
ah
renee
the
best
of
happiness
is
that
it
needs
no
dogma
and
no
fine
words
to
pave
the
way
it
speaks
for
itself
while
theory
has
been
piled
upon
theory
to
justify
the
system
of
women
vassalage
and
thralldom
if
be
so
noble
so
sublime
what
pray
of
my
joy
sheltered
by
the
canopy
of
the
church
and
witnessed
by
the
hand
and
seal
of
the
most
of
mayors
is
it
a
thing
out
of
nature
for
the
honor
of
the
law
for
her
own
sake
but
most
of
all
to
make
my
happiness
complete
i
long
to
see
my
renee
content
oh
tell
me
that
you
see
a
dawn
of
love
for
this
louis
who
adores
you
tell
me
that
the
solemn
symbolic
torch
of
hymen
has
not
alone
served
to
lighten
your
darkness
but
that
love
the
glorious
sun
of
our
hearts
pours
his
rays
on
you
i
come
back
always
you
see
to
this
midday
blaze
which
will
be
my
destruction
i
fear
dear
renee
do
you
remember
how
in
your
outbursts
of
girlish
devotion
you
would
say
to
me
as
we
sat
under
the
arbor
of
the
convent
garden
i
love
you
so
louise
that
if
god
appeared
to
me
in
a
vision
i
would
pray
him
that
all
the
sorrows
of
life
might
be
mine
and
all
the
joy
yours
i
burn
to
suffer
for
you
now
darling
the
day
has
come
when
i
take
up
your
prayer
imploring
heaven
to
grant
you
a
share
in
my
happiness
i
must
tell
you
my
idea
i
have
a
shrewd
notion
that
you
are
hatching
ambitious
plans
under
the
name
of
louis
de
very
good
get
him
elected
deputy
at
the
approaching
election
for
he
will
be
very
nearly
forty
then
and
as
the
chamber
does
not
meet
till
six
months
later
he
will
have
just
attained
the
age
necessary
to
qualify
for
a
seat
you
will
come
to
paris
there
is
that
enough
my
father
and
the
friends
i
shall
have
made
by
that
time
will
learn
to
know
and
admire
you
and
if
your
will
agree
to
found
a
family
we
will
get
the
title
of
comte
for
louis
that
is
something
at
least
and
we
shall
be
together
xxviii
renee
de
to
louise
de
macumer
december
my
thrice
happy
louise
your
letter
made
me
dizzy
for
a
few
moments
i
held
it
in
my
listless
hands
while
a
tear
or
two
sparkled
on
it
in
the
setting
sun
i
was
alone
beneath
the
small
barren
rock
where
i
have
had
a
seat
placed
far
off
like
a
lance
of
steel
the
mediterranean
shone
the
seat
is
shaded
by
aromatic
shrubs
and
i
have
had
a
very
large
jessamine
some
honeysuckle
and
spanish
brooms
transplanted
there
so
that
some
day
the
rock
will
be
entirely
covered
with
climbing
plants
the
wild
vine
has
already
taken
root
there
but
winter
draws
near
and
all
this
greenery
is
faded
like
a
piece
of
old
tapestry
in
this
spot
i
am
never
molested
it
is
understood
that
here
i
wish
to
be
alone
it
is
named
louise
seat
a
proof
is
it
not
that
even
in
solitude
i
am
not
alone
here
if
i
tell
you
all
these
details
to
you
so
paltry
and
try
to
describe
the
vision
of
green
with
which
my
prophetic
gaze
clothes
this
bare
rock
on
which
top
some
freak
of
nature
has
set
up
a
magnificent
parasol
pine
it
is
because
in
all
this
i
have
found
an
emblem
to
which
i
cling
it
was
while
your
blessed
lot
was
filling
me
with
joy
and
must
i
confess
it
with
bitter
envy
too
that
i
felt
the
first
movement
of
my
child
within
and
this
mystery
of
physical
life
reacted
upon
the
inner
recesses
of
my
soul
this
indefinable
sensation
which
partakes
of
the
nature
at
once
of
a
warning
a
delight
a
pain
a
promise
and
a
fulfilment
this
joy
which
is
mine
alone
unshared
by
mortal
this
wonder
of
wonders
has
whispered
to
me
that
one
day
this
rock
shall
be
a
carpet
of
flowers
resounding
to
the
merry
laughter
of
children
that
i
shall
at
last
be
blessed
among
women
and
from
me
shall
spring
forth
fountains
of
life
now
i
know
what
i
have
lived
for
thus
the
first
certainty
of
bearing
within
me
another
life
brought
healing
to
my
wounds
a
joy
that
beggars
description
has
crowned
for
me
those
long
days
of
sacrifice
in
which
louis
had
already
found
his
sacrifice
i
said
to
myself
how
far
does
it
excel
passion
what
pleasure
has
roots
so
deep
as
one
which
is
not
personal
but
creative
is
not
the
spirit
of
sacrifice
a
power
mightier
than
any
of
its
results
is
it
not
that
mysterious
tireless
divinity
who
hides
beneath
innumerable
spheres
in
an
unexplored
centre
through
which
all
worlds
in
turn
must
pass
sacrifice
solitary
and
secret
rich
in
pleasures
only
tasted
in
silence
which
none
can
guess
at
and
no
profane
eye
has
ever
seen
sacrifice
jealous
god
and
tyrant
god
of
strength
and
victory
exhaustless
spring
which
partaking
of
the
very
essence
of
all
that
exists
can
by
no
expenditure
be
drained
below
its
own
level
sacrifice
there
is
the
keynote
of
my
life
for
you
louise
love
is
but
the
reflex
of
felipe
passion
the
life
which
i
shed
upon
my
little
ones
will
come
back
to
me
in
fulness
the
plenty
of
your
golden
harvest
will
pass
mine
though
late
will
be
but
the
more
enduring
for
each
hour
will
see
it
renewed
love
may
be
the
fairest
gem
which
society
has
filched
from
nature
but
what
is
motherhood
save
nature
in
her
most
gladsome
mood
a
smile
has
dried
my
tears
love
makes
my
louis
happy
but
marriage
has
made
me
a
mother
and
who
shall
say
i
am
not
happy
also
with
slow
steps
then
i
returned
to
my
white
grange
with
the
green
shutters
to
write
you
these
thoughts
so
it
is
darling
that
the
most
marvelous
and
yet
the
simplest
process
of
nature
has
been
going
on
in
me
for
five
months
and
yet
in
your
ear
let
me
whisper
it
so
far
it
agitates
neither
my
heart
nor
my
understanding
i
see
all
around
me
happy
the
has
become
a
child
again
trespassing
on
the
grandchild
place
the
father
wears
a
grave
and
anxious
look
they
are
all
most
attentive
to
me
all
talk
of
the
joy
of
being
a
mother
alas
i
alone
remain
cold
and
i
dare
not
tell
you
how
dead
i
am
to
all
emotion
though
i
affect
a
little
in
order
not
to
damp
the
general
satisfaction
but
with
you
i
may
be
frank
and
i
confess
that
at
my
present
stage
motherhood
is
a
mere
affair
of
the
imagination
louis
was
to
the
full
as
much
surprised
as
i
does
not
this
show
how
little
unless
by
his
impatient
wishes
the
father
counts
for
in
this
matter
chance
my
dear
is
the
sovereign
deity
in
my
doctor
while
maintaining
that
this
chance
works
in
harmony
with
nature
does
not
deny
that
children
who
are
the
fruit
of
passionate
love
are
bound
to
be
richly
endowed
both
physically
and
mentally
and
that
often
the
happiness
which
shone
like
a
radiant
star
over
their
birth
seems
to
watch
over
them
through
life
it
may
be
then
louise
that
motherhood
reserves
joys
for
you
which
i
shall
never
know
it
may
be
that
the
feeling
of
a
mother
for
the
child
of
a
man
whom
she
adores
as
you
adore
felipe
is
different
from
that
with
which
she
regards
the
offspring
of
reason
duty
and
desperation
thoughts
such
as
these
which
i
bury
in
my
inmost
heart
add
to
the
preoccupation
only
natural
to
a
woman
soon
to
be
a
mother
and
yet
as
the
family
can
not
exist
without
children
i
long
to
speed
the
moment
from
which
the
joys
of
family
where
alone
i
am
to
find
my
life
shall
date
their
beginning
at
present
i
live
a
life
all
expectation
and
mystery
except
for
a
sickening
physical
discomfort
which
no
doubt
serves
to
prepare
a
woman
for
suffering
of
a
different
kind
i
watch
my
symptoms
and
in
spite
of
the
attentions
and
thoughtful
care
with
which
louis
anxiety
surrounds
me
i
am
conscious
of
a
vague
uneasiness
mingled
with
the
nausea
the
distaste
for
food
and
abnormal
longings
common
to
my
condition
if
i
am
to
speak
candidly
i
must
confess
at
the
risk
of
disgusting
you
with
the
whole
business
to
an
incomprehensible
craving
for
rotten
fruit
my
husband
goes
to
marseilles
to
fetch
the
finest
oranges
the
world
produces
from
malta
portugal
corsica
and
these
i
do
touch
then
i
hurry
there
myself
sometimes
on
foot
and
in
a
little
back
street
running
down
to
the
harbor
close
to
the
town
hall
i
find
wretched
oranges
two
for
a
sou
which
i
devour
eagerly
the
bluish
greenish
shades
on
the
mouldy
parts
sparkle
like
diamonds
in
my
eyes
they
are
flowers
to
me
i
forget
the
putrid
odor
and
find
them
delicious
with
a
piquant
flavor
and
stimulating
as
wine
my
dear
they
are
the
first
love
of
my
life
your
passion
for
felipe
is
nothing
to
this
sometimes
i
can
slip
out
secretly
and
fly
to
marseilles
full
of
passionate
longings
which
grow
more
intense
as
i
draw
near
the
street
i
tremble
lest
the
woman
should
be
sold
out
of
rotten
oranges
i
pounce
on
them
and
devour
them
as
i
stand
it
seems
to
me
an
ambrosial
food
and
yet
i
have
seen
louis
turn
aside
unable
to
bear
the
smell
then
came
to
my
mind
the
ghastly
words
of
obermann
in
his
gloomy
elegy
which
i
wish
i
had
never
read
roots
slake
their
thirst
in
foulest
streams
since
i
took
to
this
diet
the
sickness
has
ceased
and
i
feel
much
stronger
this
depravity
of
taste
must
have
a
meaning
for
it
seems
to
be
part
of
a
natural
process
and
to
be
common
to
most
women
sometimes
going
to
most
extravagant
lengths
when
my
situation
is
more
marked
i
shall
not
go
beyond
the
grounds
for
i
should
not
like
to
be
seen
under
these
circumstances
i
have
the
greatest
curiosity
to
know
at
what
precise
moment
the
sense
of
motherhood
begins
it
can
not
possibly
be
in
the
midst
of
frightful
suffering
the
very
thought
of
which
makes
me
shudder
farewell
favorite
of
fortune
farewell
my
friend
in
whom
i
live
again
and
through
whom
i
am
able
to
picture
to
myself
this
brave
love
this
jealousy
all
on
fire
at
a
look
these
whisperings
in
the
ear
these
joys
which
create
for
women
as
it
were
a
new
atmosphere
a
new
daylight
fresh
life
ah
pet
i
too
understand
love
do
weary
of
telling
me
everything
keep
faithful
to
our
bond
i
promise
in
my
turn
to
spare
you
nothing
nay
to
conclude
in
all
seriousness
i
will
not
conceal
from
you
that
on
reading
your
letter
a
second
time
i
was
seized
with
a
dread
which
i
could
not
shake
off
this
superb
love
seems
like
a
challenge
to
providence
will
not
the
sovereign
master
of
this
earth
calamity
take
umbrage
if
no
place
be
left
for
him
at
your
feast
what
mighty
edifice
of
fortune
has
he
not
overthrown
oh
louise
forget
not
in
all
this
happiness
your
prayers
to
god
do
good
be
kind
and
merciful
let
your
moderation
if
it
may
be
avert
disaster
religion
has
meant
much
more
to
me
since
i
left
the
convent
and
since
my
marriage
but
your
paris
news
contains
no
mention
of
it
in
your
glorification
of
felipe
it
seems
to
me
you
reverse
the
saying
and
invoke
god
less
than
his
saint
but
after
all
this
panic
is
only
excess
of
affection
you
go
to
church
together
i
do
not
doubt
and
do
good
in
secret
the
close
of
this
letter
will
seem
to
you
very
primitive
i
expect
but
think
of
the
too
eager
friendship
which
prompts
these
fears
a
friendship
of
the
type
of
la
fontaine
which
takes
alarms
at
dreams
at
misty
ideas
you
deserve
to
be
happy
since
through
it
all
you
still
think
of
me
no
less
than
i
think
of
you
in
my
monotonous
life
which
though
it
lacks
color
is
yet
not
empty
and
if
uneventful
is
not
unfruitful
god
bless
you
then
xxix
de
to
the
baronne
de
macumer
december
madame
it
is
the
desire
of
my
wife
that
you
should
not
learn
first
from
the
formal
announcement
of
an
event
which
has
filled
us
with
joy
renee
has
just
given
birth
to
a
fine
boy
whose
baptism
we
are
postponing
till
your
return
to
chantepleurs
renee
and
i
both
earnestly
hope
that
you
may
then
come
as
far
as
la
crampade
and
will
consent
to
act
as
godmother
to
our
firstborn
in
this
hope
i
have
had
him
placed
on
the
register
under
the
name
of
de
our
dear
renee
suffered
much
but
bore
it
with
angelic
patience
you
who
know
her
will
easily
understand
that
the
assurance
of
bringing
happiness
to
us
all
supported
her
through
this
trying
apprenticeship
to
motherhood
without
indulging
in
the
more
or
less
ludicrous
exaggerations
to
which
the
novel
sensation
of
being
a
father
is
apt
to
give
rise
i
may
tell
you
that
little
armand
is
a
beautiful
infant
and
you
will
have
no
difficulty
in
believing
it
when
i
add
that
he
has
renee
features
and
eyes
so
far
at
least
this
gives
proof
of
intelligence
the
physician
and
accoucheur
assure
us
that
renee
is
now
quite
out
of
danger
and
as
she
is
proving
an
admirable
nurse
nature
has
endowed
her
so
generously
my
father
and
i
are
able
to
give
free
rein
to
our
joy
madame
may
i
be
allowed
to
express
the
hope
that
this
joy
so
vivid
and
intense
which
has
brought
fresh
life
into
our
house
and
has
changed
the
face
of
existence
for
my
dear
wife
may
ere
long
be
yours
renee
has
had
a
suite
of
rooms
prepared
and
i
only
wish
i
could
make
them
worthy
of
our
guests
but
the
cordial
friendliness
of
the
reception
which
awaits
you
may
perhaps
atone
for
any
lack
of
splendor
i
have
heard
from
renee
madame
of
your
kind
thought
in
regard
to
us
and
i
take
this
opportunity
of
thanking
you
for
it
the
more
gladly
because
nothing
could
now
be
more
appropriate
the
birth
of
a
grandson
has
reconciled
my
father
to
sacrifices
which
bear
hardly
on
an
old
man
he
has
just
bought
two
estates
and
la
crampade
is
now
a
property
with
an
annual
rental
of
thirty
thousand
francs
my
father
intends
asking
the
king
permission
to
form
an
entailed
estate
of
it
and
if
you
are
good
enough
to
get
for
him
the
title
of
which
you
spoke
in
your
last
letter
you
will
have
already
done
much
for
your
godson
for
my
part
i
shall
carry
out
your
suggestions
solely
with
the
object
of
bringing
you
and
renee
together
during
the
sessions
of
the
chamber
i
am
working
hard
with
the
view
of
becoming
what
is
called
a
specialist
but
nothing
could
give
me
greater
encouragement
in
my
labors
than
the
thought
that
you
will
take
an
interest
in
my
little
armand
come
then
we
beg
of
you
and
with
your
beauty
and
your
grace
your
playful
fancy
and
your
noble
soul
enact
the
part
of
good
fairy
to
my
son
and
heir
you
will
thus
madame
add
undying
gratitude
to
the
respectful
regard
of
your
very
humble
obedient
servant
louis
de
xxx
louise
de
macumer
to
renee
de
january
macumer
has
just
wakened
me
darling
with
your
husband
letter
first
and
foremost
yes
we
shall
be
going
to
chantepleurs
about
the
end
of
april
to
me
it
will
be
a
piling
up
of
pleasure
to
travel
to
see
you
and
to
be
the
godmother
of
your
first
child
i
must
please
have
macumer
for
godfather
to
take
part
in
a
ceremony
of
the
church
with
another
as
my
partner
would
be
hateful
to
me
ah
if
you
could
see
the
look
he
gave
me
as
i
said
this
you
would
know
what
store
this
sweetest
of
lovers
sets
on
his
wife
i
am
the
more
bent
on
our
visiting
la
crampade
together
felipe
i
went
on
because
i
might
have
a
child
there
i
too
you
know
would
be
a
mother
and
yet
can
you
fancy
me
torn
in
two
between
you
and
the
infant
to
begin
with
if
i
saw
any
creature
were
it
even
my
own
son
taking
my
place
in
your
heart
i
could
answer
for
the
consequences
medea
may
have
been
right
after
all
the
greeks
had
some
good
notions
and
he
laughed
so
my
sweetheart
you
have
the
fruit
without
the
flowers
i
the
flowers
without
the
fruit
the
contrast
in
our
lives
still
holds
good
between
the
two
of
us
we
have
surely
enough
philosophy
to
find
the
moral
of
it
some
day
bah
only
ten
months
married
too
soon
you
will
admit
to
give
up
hope
we
are
leading
a
gay
yet
far
from
empty
life
as
is
the
way
with
happy
people
the
days
are
never
long
enough
for
us
society
seeing
me
in
the
trappings
of
a
married
woman
pronounces
the
baronne
de
macumer
much
prettier
than
louise
de
chaulieu
a
happy
love
is
a
most
becoming
cosmetic
when
felipe
and
i
drive
along
the
in
the
bright
sunshine
of
a
crisp
january
day
beneath
the
trees
frosted
with
clusters
of
white
stars
and
face
all
paris
on
the
spot
where
last
year
we
met
with
a
gulf
between
us
the
contrast
calls
up
a
thousand
fancies
suppose
after
all
your
last
letter
should
be
right
in
its
forecast
and
we
are
too
presumptuous
if
i
am
ignorant
of
a
mother
joys
you
shall
tell
me
about
them
i
will
learn
by
sympathy
but
my
imagination
can
picture
nothing
to
equal
the
rapture
of
love
you
will
laugh
at
my
extravagance
but
i
assure
you
that
a
dozen
times
in
as
many
months
the
longing
has
seized
me
to
die
at
thirty
while
life
was
still
untarnished
amidst
the
roses
of
love
in
the
embrace
of
passion
to
bid
farewell
to
the
feast
at
its
brightest
before
disappointment
has
come
having
lived
in
this
sunshine
and
celestial
air
and
spent
myself
in
love
not
a
leaf
dropped
from
my
crown
not
an
illusion
perished
in
my
heart
what
a
dream
is
there
think
what
it
would
be
to
bear
about
a
young
heart
in
an
aged
body
to
see
only
cold
dumb
faces
around
me
where
even
strangers
used
to
smile
to
be
a
worthy
matron
can
hell
have
a
worse
torture
on
this
very
subject
in
fact
felipe
and
i
have
had
our
first
quarrel
i
contended
that
he
ought
to
have
sufficient
moral
strength
to
kill
me
in
my
sleep
when
i
have
reached
thirty
so
that
i
might
pass
from
one
dream
to
another
the
wretch
declined
i
threatened
to
leave
him
alone
in
the
world
and
poor
child
he
turned
white
as
a
sheet
my
dear
this
distinguished
statesman
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
baby
it
is
incredible
what
youth
and
simplicity
he
contrived
to
hide
away
now
that
i
allow
myself
to
think
aloud
with
him
as
i
do
with
you
and
have
no
secrets
from
him
we
are
always
giving
each
other
surprises
dear
renee
felipe
and
louise
the
pair
of
lovers
want
to
send
a
present
to
the
young
mother
we
would
like
to
get
something
that
would
give
you
pleasure
and
we
do
share
the
popular
taste
for
surprises
so
tell
me
quite
frankly
please
what
you
would
like
it
ought
to
be
something
which
would
recall
us
to
you
in
a
pleasant
way
something
which
you
will
use
every
day
and
which
wo
wear
out
with
use
the
meal
which
with
us
is
most
cheerful
and
friendly
is
lunch
and
therefore
the
idea
occurred
to
me
of
a
special
luncheon
service
ornamented
with
figures
of
babies
if
you
approve
of
this
let
me
know
at
once
for
it
will
have
to
be
ordered
immediately
if
we
are
to
bring
it
paris
artists
are
gentlemen
of
far
too
much
importance
to
be
hurried
this
will
be
my
offering
to
lucina
farewell
dear
nursing
mother
may
all
a
mother
delights
be
yours
i
await
with
impatience
your
first
letter
which
will
tell
me
all
about
it
i
hope
some
of
the
details
in
your
husband
letter
went
to
my
heart
poor
renee
a
mother
has
a
heavy
price
to
pay
i
will
tell
my
godson
how
dearly
he
must
love
you
no
end
of
love
my
sweet
one
xxxi
renee
de
to
louise
de
macumer
it
is
nearly
five
months
now
since
baby
was
born
and
not
once
dear
heart
have
i
found
a
single
moment
for
writing
to
you
when
you
are
a
mother
yourself
you
will
be
more
ready
to
excuse
me
than
you
are
now
for
you
have
punished
me
a
little
bit
in
making
your
own
letters
so
few
and
far
between
do
write
my
darling
tell
me
of
your
pleasures
lay
on
the
blue
as
brightly
as
you
please
it
will
not
hurt
me
for
i
am
happy
now
happier
than
you
can
imagine
i
went
in
state
to
the
parish
church
to
hear
the
mass
for
recovery
from
childbirth
as
is
the
custom
in
the
old
families
of
provence
i
was
supported
on
either
side
by
the
two
grandfathers
louis
father
and
my
own
never
had
i
knelt
before
god
with
such
a
flood
of
gratitude
in
my
heart
i
have
so
much
to
tell
you
of
so
many
feelings
to
describe
that
i
do
know
where
to
begin
but
from
amidst
these
confused
memories
one
rises
distinctly
that
of
my
prayer
in
the
church
when
i
found
myself
transformed
into
a
joyful
mother
on
the
very
spot
where
as
a
girl
i
had
trembled
for
my
future
it
seemed
to
my
fancy
that
the
virgin
on
the
altar
bowed
her
head
and
pointed
to
the
infant
christ
who
smiled
at
me
my
heart
full
of
pure
and
heavenly
love
i
held
out
little
armand
for
the
priest
to
bless
and
bathe
in
anticipation
of
the
regular
baptism
to
come
later
but
you
will
see
us
together
then
armand
and
me
my
child
come
see
how
readily
the
word
comes
and
indeed
there
is
none
sweeter
to
a
mother
heart
and
mind
or
on
her
lips
well
then
dear
child
during
the
last
two
months
i
used
to
drag
myself
wearily
and
heavily
about
the
gardens
not
realizing
yet
how
precious
was
the
burden
spite
of
all
the
discomforts
it
brought
i
was
haunted
by
forebodings
so
gloomy
and
ghastly
that
they
got
the
better
even
of
curiosity
in
vain
did
i
picture
the
delights
of
motherhood
my
heart
made
no
response
even
to
the
thought
of
the
little
one
who
announced
himself
by
lively
kicking
that
is
a
sensation
dear
which
may
be
welcome
when
it
is
familiar
but
as
a
novelty
it
is
more
strange
than
pleasing
i
speak
for
myself
at
least
you
know
i
would
never
affect
anything
i
did
not
really
feel
and
i
look
on
my
child
as
a
gift
straight
from
heaven
for
one
who
saw
in
it
rather
the
image
of
the
man
she
loved
it
might
be
different
but
enough
of
such
sad
thoughts
gone
i
trust
for
ever
when
the
crisis
came
i
summoned
all
my
powers
of
resistance
and
braced
myself
so
well
for
suffering
that
i
bore
the
horrible
agony
so
they
tell
me
quite
marvelously
for
about
an
hour
i
sank
into
a
sort
of
stupor
of
the
nature
of
a
dream
i
seemed
to
myself
then
two
beings
an
outer
covering
racked
and
tortured
by
pincers
and
a
soul
at
peace
in
this
strange
state
the
pain
formed
itself
into
a
sort
of
halo
hovering
over
me
a
gigantic
rose
seemed
to
spring
out
of
my
head
and
grow
ever
larger
and
larger
till
it
enfolded
me
in
its
petals
the
same
color
dyed
the
air
around
and
everything
i
saw
was
at
last
the
climax
came
when
soul
and
body
seemed
no
longer
able
to
hold
together
the
spasms
of
pain
gripped
me
like
death
itself
i
screamed
aloud
and
found
fresh
strength
against
this
fresh
torture
suddenly
this
concert
of
hideous
cries
was
overborne
by
a
joyful
sound
the
shrill
wail
of
the
newborn
infant
no
words
can
describe
that
moment
it
was
as
though
the
universe
took
part
in
my
cries
when
all
at
once
the
chorus
of
pain
fell
hushed
before
the
child
feeble
note
they
laid
me
back
again
in
the
large
bed
and
it
felt
like
paradise
to
me
even
in
my
extreme
exhaustion
three
or
four
happy
faces
pointed
through
tears
to
the
child
my
dear
i
exclaimed
in
terror
it
just
like
a
little
monkey
are
you
really
and
truly
certain
it
is
a
child
i
fell
back
on
my
side
miserably
disappointed
at
my
first
experience
of
motherly
feeling
do
worry
dear
said
my
mother
who
had
installed
herself
as
nurse
why
you
got
the
finest
baby
in
the
world
you
must
excite
yourself
but
give
your
whole
mind
now
to
turning
yourself
as
much
as
possible
into
an
animal
a
milch
cow
pasturing
in
the
meadow
i
fell
asleep
then
fully
resolved
to
let
nature
have
her
way
ah
my
sweet
how
heavenly
it
was
to
waken
up
from
all
the
pain
and
haziness
of
the
first
days
when
everything
was
still
dim
uncomfortable
confused
a
ray
of
light
pierced
the
darkness
my
heart
and
soul
my
inner
self
a
self
i
had
never
known
before
rent
the
envelope
of
gloomy
suffering
as
a
flower
bursts
its
sheath
at
the
first
warm
kiss
of
the
sun
at
the
moment
when
the
little
wretch
fastened
on
my
breast
and
sucked
not
even
the
sensation
of
the
child
first
cry
was
so
exquisite
as
this
this
is
the
dawn
of
motherhood
this
is
the
here
is
happiness
joy
ineffable
though
it
comes
not
without
pangs
oh
my
sweet
jealous
soul
how
you
will
relish
a
delight
which
exists
only
for
ourselves
the
child
and
god
for
this
tiny
creature
all
knowledge
is
summed
up
in
its
mother
breast
this
is
the
one
bright
spot
in
its
world
towards
which
its
puny
strength
goes
forth
its
thoughts
cluster
round
this
spring
of
life
which
it
leaves
only
to
sleep
and
whither
it
returns
on
waking
its
lips
have
a
sweetness
beyond
words
and
their
pressure
is
at
once
a
pain
and
a
delight
a
delight
which
by
every
excess
becomes
pain
or
a
pain
which
culminates
in
delight
the
sensation
which
rises
from
it
and
which
penetrates
to
the
very
core
of
my
life
baffles
all
description
it
seems
a
sort
of
centre
whence
a
myriad
rays
gladden
the
heart
and
soul
to
bear
a
child
is
nothing
to
nourish
it
is
birth
renewed
every
hour
oh
louise
there
is
no
caress
of
lover
with
half
the
power
of
those
little
pink
hands
as
they
stray
about
seeking
whereby
to
lay
hold
on
life
and
the
infant
glances
now
turned
upon
the
breast
now
raised
to
meet
our
own
what
dreams
come
to
us
as
we
watch
the
clinging
nursling
all
our
powers
whether
of
mind
or
body
are
at
its
service
for
it
we
breathe
and
think
in
it
our
longings
are
more
than
satisfied
the
sweet
sensation
of
warmth
at
the
heart
which
the
sound
of
his
first
cry
brought
to
me
like
the
first
ray
of
sunshine
on
the
earth
came
again
as
i
felt
the
milk
flow
into
his
mouth
again
as
his
eyes
met
mine
and
at
this
moment
i
have
felt
it
once
more
as
his
first
smile
gave
token
of
a
mind
working
within
for
he
has
laughed
my
dear
a
laugh
a
glance
a
bite
a
cry
four
miracles
of
gladness
which
go
straight
to
the
heart
and
strike
chords
that
respond
to
no
other
touch
a
child
is
tied
to
our
as
the
spheres
are
linked
to
their
creator
we
can
not
think
of
god
except
as
a
mother
heart
writ
large
it
is
only
in
the
act
of
nursing
that
a
woman
realizes
her
motherhood
in
visible
and
tangible
fashion
it
is
a
joy
of
every
moment
the
milk
becomes
flesh
before
our
eyes
it
blossoms
into
the
tips
of
those
delicate
fingers
it
expands
in
tender
transparent
nails
it
spins
the
silky
tresses
it
kicks
in
the
little
feet
oh
those
baby
feet
how
plainly
they
talk
to
us
in
them
the
child
finds
its
first
language
yes
louise
nursing
is
a
miracle
of
transformation
going
on
before
one
bewildered
eyes
those
cries
they
go
to
your
heart
and
not
your
ears
those
smiling
eyes
and
lips
those
plunging
feet
they
speak
in
words
which
could
not
be
plainer
if
god
traced
them
before
you
in
letters
of
fire
what
else
is
there
in
the
world
to
care
about
the
father
why
you
could
kill
him
if
he
dreamed
of
waking
the
baby
just
as
the
child
is
the
world
to
us
so
do
we
stand
alone
in
the
world
for
the
child
the
sweet
consciousness
of
a
common
life
is
ample
recompense
for
all
the
trouble
and
suffering
for
suffering
there
is
heaven
save
you
louise
from
ever
knowing
the
maddening
agony
of
a
wound
which
gapes
afresh
with
every
pressure
of
rosy
lips
and
is
so
hard
to
heal
the
heaviest
tax
perhaps
imposed
on
beauty
for
know
louise
and
beware
it
visits
only
a
fair
and
delicate
skin
my
little
ape
has
in
five
months
developed
into
the
prettiest
darling
that
ever
mother
bathed
in
tears
of
joy
washed
brushed
combed
and
made
smart
for
god
knows
what
unwearied
care
we
lavish
upon
those
tender
blossoms
so
my
monkey
has
ceased
to
exist
and
behold
in
his
stead
a
as
my
english
nurse
says
a
regular
baby
he
cries
very
little
too
now
for
he
is
conscious
of
the
love
bestowed
on
him
indeed
i
hardly
ever
leave
him
and
i
strive
to
wrap
him
round
in
the
atmosphere
of
my
love
dear
i
have
a
feeling
now
for
louis
which
is
not
love
but
which
ought
to
be
the
crown
of
a
woman
love
where
it
exists
nay
i
am
not
sure
whether
this
tender
fondness
this
unselfish
gratitude
is
not
superior
to
love
from
all
that
you
have
told
me
of
it
dear
pet
i
gather
that
love
has
something
terribly
earthly
about
it
whilst
a
strain
of
holy
piety
purifies
the
affection
a
happy
mother
feels
for
the
author
of
her
and
enduring
joys
a
mother
happiness
is
like
a
beacon
lighting
up
the
future
but
reflected
also
on
the
past
in
the
guise
of
fond
memories
the
old
and
his
son
have
moreover
redoubled
their
devotion
to
me
i
am
like
a
new
person
to
them
every
time
they
see
me
and
speak
to
me
it
is
with
a
fresh
holiday
joy
which
touches
me
deeply
the
grandfather
has
i
verily
believe
turned
child
again
he
looks
at
me
admiringly
and
the
first
time
i
came
down
to
lunch
he
was
moved
to
tears
to
see
me
eating
and
suckling
the
child
the
moisture
in
these
dry
old
eyes
generally
expressive
only
of
avarice
was
a
wonderful
comfort
to
me
i
felt
that
the
good
soul
entered
into
my
joy
as
for
louis
he
would
shout
aloud
to
the
trees
and
stones
of
the
highway
that
he
has
a
son
and
he
spends
whole
hours
watching
your
sleeping
godson
he
does
not
know
he
says
when
he
will
grow
used
to
it
these
extravagant
expressions
of
delight
show
me
how
great
must
have
been
their
fears
beforehand
louis
has
confided
in
me
that
he
had
believed
himself
condemned
to
be
childless
poor
fellow
he
has
all
at
once
developed
very
much
and
he
works
even
harder
than
he
did
the
father
in
him
has
quickened
his
ambition
for
myself
dear
soul
i
grow
happier
and
happier
every
moment
each
hour
creates
a
fresh
tie
between
the
mother
and
her
infant
the
very
nature
of
my
feelings
proves
to
me
that
they
are
normal
permanent
and
indestructible
whereas
i
shrewdly
suspect
love
for
instance
of
being
intermittent
certainly
it
is
not
the
same
at
all
moments
the
flowers
which
it
weaves
into
the
web
of
life
are
not
all
of
equal
brightness
love
in
short
can
and
must
decline
but
a
mother
love
has
no
to
fear
rather
it
grows
with
the
growth
of
the
child
needs
and
strengthens
with
its
strength
is
it
not
at
once
a
passion
a
natural
craving
a
feeling
a
duty
a
necessity
a
joy
yes
darling
here
is
woman
true
sphere
here
the
passion
for
can
expend
itself
and
no
jealousy
intrudes
here
too
is
perhaps
the
single
point
on
which
society
and
nature
are
at
one
society
in
this
matter
enforces
the
dictates
of
nature
strengthening
the
maternal
instinct
by
adding
to
it
family
spirit
and
the
desire
of
perpetuating
a
name
a
race
an
estate
how
tenderly
must
not
a
woman
cherish
the
child
who
has
been
the
first
to
open
up
to
her
these
joys
the
first
to
call
forth
the
energies
of
her
nature
and
to
instruct
her
in
the
grand
art
of
motherhood
the
right
of
the
eldest
which
in
the
earliest
times
formed
a
part
of
the
natural
order
and
was
lost
in
the
origins
of
society
ought
never
in
my
opinion
to
have
been
questioned
ah
how
much
a
mother
learns
from
her
child
the
constant
protection
of
a
helpless
being
forces
us
to
so
strict
an
alliance
with
virtue
that
a
woman
never
shows
to
full
advantage
except
as
a
mother
then
alone
can
her
character
expand
in
the
fulfilment
of
all
duties
and
the
enjoyment
of
all
its
pleasures
a
woman
who
is
not
a
mother
is
maimed
and
incomplete
hasten
then
my
sweetest
to
fulfil
your
mission
your
present
happiness
will
then
be
multiplied
by
the
wealth
of
my
delights
i
had
to
tear
myself
from
you
because
your
godson
was
crying
i
can
hear
his
cry
from
the
bottom
of
the
garden
but
i
would
not
let
this
go
without
a
word
of
farewell
i
have
just
been
reading
over
what
i
have
said
and
am
horrified
to
see
how
vulgar
are
the
feelings
expressed
what
i
feel
every
mother
alas
since
the
beginning
must
have
felt
i
suppose
in
the
same
way
and
put
into
the
same
words
you
will
laugh
at
me
as
we
do
at
the
naive
father
who
dilates
on
the
beauty
and
cleverness
of
his
of
course
quite
exceptional
offspring
but
the
refrain
of
my
letter
darling
is
this
and
i
repeat
it
i
am
as
happy
now
as
i
used
to
be
miserable
this
grange
and
is
it
not
going
to
be
an
estate
a
family
property
has
become
my
land
of
promise
the
desert
is
past
and
over
a
thousand
loves
darling
pet
write
to
me
for
now
i
can
read
without
a
tear
the
tale
of
your
happy
love
farewell
xxxii
mme
de
macumer
to
mme
de
march
do
you
know
dear
that
it
is
more
than
three
months
since
i
have
written
to
you
or
heard
from
you
i
am
the
more
guilty
of
the
two
for
i
did
not
reply
to
your
last
but
you
do
stand
on
punctilio
surely
macumer
and
i
have
taken
your
silence
for
consent
as
regards
the
luncheon
service
and
the
little
cherubs
are
starting
this
morning
for
marseilles
it
took
six
months
to
carry
out
the
design
and
so
when
felipe
asked
me
to
come
and
see
the
service
before
it
was
packed
i
suddenly
waked
up
to
the
fact
that
we
had
not
interchanged
a
word
since
the
letter
of
yours
which
gave
me
an
insight
into
a
heart
my
sweet
it
is
this
terrible
paris
there
my
excuse
what
pray
is
yours
oh
what
a
whirlpool
is
society
did
i
tell
you
once
that
in
paris
one
must
be
as
the
parisians
society
there
drives
out
all
sentiment
it
lays
en
embargo
on
your
time
and
unless
you
are
very
careful
soon
eats
away
your
heart
altogether
what
an
amazing
masterpiece
is
the
character
of
celimene
in
moliere
she
is
the
society
woman
not
only
of
louis
xiv
time
but
of
our
own
and
of
all
time
where
should
i
be
but
for
my
breastplate
the
love
i
bear
felipe
this
very
morning
i
told
him
as
the
outcome
of
these
reflections
that
he
was
my
salvation
if
my
evenings
are
a
continuous
round
of
parties
balls
concerts
and
theatres
at
night
my
heart
expands
again
and
is
healed
of
the
wounds
received
in
the
world
by
the
delights
of
the
passionate
love
which
await
my
return
i
dine
at
home
only
when
we
have
friends
with
us
and
spend
the
afternoon
there
only
on
my
day
for
i
have
a
day
now
wednesday
for
receiving
i
have
entered
the
lists
with
mmes
and
de
maufrigneuse
and
with
the
old
duchesse
de
lenoncourt
and
my
house
has
the
reputation
of
being
a
very
lively
one
i
allowed
myself
to
become
the
fashion
because
i
saw
how
much
pleasure
my
success
gave
felipe
my
mornings
are
his
from
four
in
the
afternoon
till
two
in
the
morning
i
belong
to
paris
macumer
makes
an
admirable
host
witty
and
dignified
perfect
in
courtesy
and
with
an
air
of
real
distinction
no
woman
could
help
loving
such
a
husband
even
if
she
had
chosen
him
without
consulting
her
heart
my
father
and
mother
have
left
for
madrid
louis
xviii
being
out
of
the
way
the
duchess
had
no
difficulty
in
obtaining
from
our
charles
the
appointment
of
her
fascinating
poet
so
he
is
carried
off
in
the
capacity
of
attache
my
brother
the
duc
de
rhetore
deigns
to
recognize
me
as
a
person
of
mark
as
for
my
younger
brother
the
comte
de
chaulieu
this
buckram
warrior
owes
me
everlasting
gratitude
before
my
father
left
he
spent
my
fortune
in
acquiring
for
the
count
an
estate
of
forty
thousand
francs
a
year
entailed
on
the
title
and
his
marriage
with
mlle
de
mortsauf
an
heiress
from
touraine
is
definitely
arranged
the
king
in
order
to
preserve
the
name
and
titles
of
the
de
lenoncourt
and
de
givry
families
from
extinction
is
to
confer
these
together
with
the
armorial
bearings
by
patent
on
my
brother
certainly
it
would
never
have
done
to
allow
these
two
fine
names
and
their
splendid
motto
semper
to
perish
mlle
de
mortsauf
who
is
granddaughter
and
sole
heiress
of
the
duc
de
will
it
is
said
inherit
altogether
more
than
one
hundred
thousand
livres
a
year
the
only
stipulation
my
father
has
made
is
that
the
de
chaulieu
arms
should
appear
in
the
centre
of
the
de
lenoncourt
escutcheon
thus
my
brother
will
be
duc
de
lenoncourt
the
young
de
mortsauf
to
whom
everything
would
otherwise
go
is
in
the
last
stage
of
consumption
his
death
is
looked
for
every
day
the
marriage
will
take
place
next
winter
when
the
family
are
out
of
mourning
i
am
told
that
i
shall
have
a
charming
in
mlle
de
mortsauf
so
you
see
that
my
father
reasoning
is
justified
the
outcome
of
it
all
has
won
me
many
compliments
and
my
marriage
is
explained
to
everybody
satisfaction
to
complete
our
success
the
prince
de
talleyrand
out
of
affection
for
my
grandmother
is
showing
himself
a
warm
friend
to
macumer
society
which
began
by
criticising
me
has
now
passed
to
cordial
admiration
in
short
i
now
reign
a
queen
where
barely
two
years
ago
i
was
an
insignificant
item
macumer
finds
himself
the
object
of
universal
envy
as
the
husband
of
the
most
charming
woman
in
paris
at
least
a
score
of
women
as
you
know
are
always
in
that
proud
position
men
murmur
sweet
things
in
my
ear
or
content
themselves
with
greedy
glances
this
chorus
of
longing
and
admiration
is
so
soothing
to
one
vanity
that
i
confess
i
begin
to
understand
the
unconscionable
price
women
are
ready
to
pay
for
such
frail
and
precarious
privileges
a
triumph
of
this
kind
is
like
strong
wine
to
vanity
and
all
the
feelings
to
pose
perpetually
as
a
divinity
is
a
draught
so
potent
in
its
intoxicating
effects
that
i
am
no
longer
surprised
to
see
women
grow
selfish
callous
and
frivolous
in
the
heart
of
this
adoration
the
fumes
of
society
mount
to
the
head
you
lavish
the
wealth
of
your
soul
and
spirit
the
treasures
of
your
time
the
noblest
efforts
of
your
will
upon
a
crowd
of
people
who
repay
you
in
smiles
and
jealousy
the
false
coin
of
their
pretty
speeches
compliments
and
flattery
is
the
only
return
they
give
for
the
solid
gold
of
your
courage
and
sacrifices
and
all
the
thought
that
must
go
to
keep
up
without
flagging
the
standard
of
beauty
dress
sparkling
talk
and
general
affability
you
are
perfectly
aware
how
much
it
costs
and
that
the
whole
thing
is
a
fraud
but
you
can
not
keep
out
of
the
vortex
ah
my
sweetheart
how
one
craves
for
a
real
friend
how
precious
to
me
are
the
love
and
devotion
of
felipe
and
how
my
heart
goes
out
to
you
joyfully
indeed
are
we
preparing
for
our
move
to
chantepleurs
where
we
can
rest
from
the
comedy
of
the
rue
de
bac
and
of
the
paris
having
just
read
your
letter
again
i
feel
that
i
can
not
better
describe
this
demoniac
paradise
than
by
saying
that
no
woman
of
fashion
in
paris
can
possibly
be
a
good
mother
then
for
a
short
time
dear
one
we
shall
stay
at
chantepleurs
only
a
week
at
most
and
shall
be
with
you
about
may
so
we
are
actually
to
meet
again
after
more
than
two
years
what
changes
since
then
here
we
are
both
matrons
both
in
our
promised
land
i
of
love
you
of
motherhood
if
i
have
not
written
my
sweetest
it
is
not
because
i
have
forgotten
you
and
what
of
the
monkey
godson
is
he
still
pretty
and
a
credit
to
me
he
must
be
more
than
nine
months
old
now
i
should
dearly
like
to
be
present
when
he
makes
his
first
steps
upon
this
earth
but
macumer
tells
me
that
even
precocious
infants
hardly
walk
at
ten
months
we
shall
have
some
good
gossips
there
and
cut
pinafores
as
the
blois
folk
say
i
shall
see
whether
a
child
as
the
saying
goes
spoils
the
pattern
if
you
deign
to
reply
from
your
maternal
heights
address
to
chantepleurs
i
am
just
off
xxxiii
mme
de
to
mme
de
macumer
my
child
if
ever
you
become
a
mother
you
will
find
out
that
it
is
impossible
to
write
letters
during
the
first
two
months
of
your
nursing
mary
my
english
nurse
and
i
are
both
quite
knocked
up
it
is
true
i
had
not
told
you
that
i
was
determined
to
do
everything
myself
before
the
event
i
had
with
my
own
fingers
sewn
the
baby
clothes
and
embroidered
and
edged
with
lace
the
little
caps
i
am
a
slave
my
pet
a
slave
day
and
night
to
begin
with
master
takes
his
meals
when
it
pleases
him
and
that
is
always
then
he
has
often
to
be
changed
washed
and
dressed
his
mother
is
so
fond
of
watching
him
sleep
of
singing
songs
to
him
of
walking
him
about
in
her
arms
on
a
fine
day
that
she
has
little
time
left
to
attend
to
herself
in
short
what
society
has
been
to
you
my
child
our
child
has
been
to
me
i
can
not
tell
you
how
full
and
rich
my
life
has
become
and
i
long
for
your
coming
that
you
may
see
for
yourself
the
only
thing
is
i
am
afraid
he
will
soon
be
teething
and
that
you
will
find
a
peevish
crying
baby
so
far
he
has
not
cried
much
for
i
am
always
at
hand
babies
only
cry
when
their
wants
are
not
understood
and
i
am
constantly
on
the
lookout
for
his
oh
my
sweet
my
heart
has
opened
up
so
wide
while
you
allow
yours
to
shrink
and
shrivel
at
the
bidding
of
society
i
look
for
your
coming
with
all
a
hermit
longing
i
want
so
much
to
know
what
you
think
of
just
as
you
no
doubt
are
curious
for
my
opinion
of
macumer
write
to
me
from
your
last
the
gentlemen
want
to
go
and
meet
our
distinguished
guests
come
queen
of
paris
come
to
our
humble
grange
where
love
at
least
will
greet
you
xxxiv
mme
de
macumer
to
the
vicomtesse
de
april
the
name
on
this
address
will
tell
you
dear
that
my
petition
has
been
granted
your
is
now
comte
de
i
would
not
leave
paris
till
i
had
obtained
the
gratification
of
your
wishes
and
i
am
writing
in
the
presence
of
the
keeper
of
the
seals
who
has
come
to
tell
me
that
the
patent
is
signed
for
a
short
time
xxxv
the
same
to
the
same
marseilles
july
i
am
ashamed
to
think
how
my
sudden
flight
will
have
taken
you
by
surprise
but
since
i
am
above
all
honest
and
since
i
love
you
not
one
bit
the
less
i
shall
tell
you
the
truth
in
four
words
i
am
horribly
jealous
felipe
eyes
were
too
often
on
you
you
used
to
have
little
talks
together
at
the
foot
of
your
rock
which
were
a
torture
to
me
and
i
was
fast
becoming
irritable
and
unlike
myself
your
truly
spanish
beauty
could
not
fail
to
recall
to
him
his
native
land
and
along
with
it
marie
heredia
and
i
can
be
jealous
of
the
past
too
your
magnificent
black
hair
your
lovely
dark
eyes
your
brow
where
the
peaceful
joy
of
motherhood
stands
out
radiant
against
the
shadows
which
tell
of
past
suffering
the
freshness
of
your
southern
skin
far
fairer
than
that
of
a
blonde
like
me
the
splendid
lines
of
your
figure
the
breasts
on
which
my
godson
hangs
peeping
through
the
lace
like
some
luscious
fruit
all
this
stabbed
me
in
the
eyes
and
in
the
heart
in
vain
did
i
stick
cornflowers
in
my
curls
in
vain
set
off
with
ribbons
the
tameness
of
my
pale
locks
everything
looked
washed
out
when
renee
appeared
a
renee
so
unlike
the
one
i
expected
to
find
in
your
oasis
then
felipe
made
too
much
of
the
child
whom
i
found
myself
beginning
to
hate
yes
i
confess
it
that
exuberance
of
life
which
fills
your
house
making
it
gay
with
shouts
and
laughter
i
wanted
it
for
myself
i
read
a
regret
in
macumer
eyes
and
unknown
to
him
i
cried
over
it
two
whole
nights
i
was
miserable
in
your
house
you
are
too
beautiful
as
a
woman
too
triumphant
as
a
mother
for
me
to
endure
your
company
ah
you
complained
of
your
lot
hypocrite
what
would
you
have
is
most
presentable
he
talks
well
he
has
fine
eyes
and
his
black
hair
dashed
with
white
is
very
becoming
his
southern
manners
too
have
something
attractive
about
them
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
he
will
sooner
or
later
be
elected
deputy
for
the
in
the
chamber
he
is
sure
to
come
to
the
front
for
you
can
always
count
on
me
to
promote
your
interests
the
sufferings
of
his
exile
have
given
him
that
calm
and
dignified
air
which
goes
in
my
opinion
to
make
a
politician
for
the
whole
art
of
politics
dear
seems
to
me
to
consist
in
looking
serious
at
this
rate
macumer
as
i
told
him
ought
certainly
to
have
a
high
position
in
the
state
and
so
having
completely
satisfied
myself
of
your
happiness
i
fly
off
contented
to
my
dear
chantepleurs
where
felipe
must
really
achieve
his
aspirations
i
have
made
up
my
mind
not
to
receive
you
there
without
a
fine
baby
at
my
breast
to
match
yours
oh
i
know
very
well
i
deserve
all
the
epithets
you
can
hurl
at
me
i
am
a
fool
a
wretch
an
idiot
alas
that
is
just
what
jealousy
means
i
am
not
vexed
with
you
but
i
was
miserable
and
you
will
forgive
me
for
escaping
from
my
misery
two
days
more
and
i
should
have
made
an
exhibition
of
myself
yes
there
would
have
been
an
outbreak
of
vulgarity
but
in
spite
of
the
rage
gnawing
at
my
heart
i
am
glad
to
have
come
glad
to
have
seen
you
in
the
pride
of
your
beautiful
motherhood
my
friend
still
as
i
remain
yours
in
all
the
absorption
of
my
love
why
even
here
at
marseilles
only
a
step
from
your
door
i
begin
to
feel
proud
of
you
and
of
the
splendid
mother
that
you
will
make
how
well
you
judged
your
vocation
you
seem
to
me
born
for
the
part
of
mother
rather
than
of
lover
exactly
as
the
reverse
is
true
of
me
there
are
women
capable
of
neither
or
silly
women
a
good
mother
and
a
passionately
loving
wife
have
this
in
common
that
they
both
need
intelligence
and
discretion
ever
at
hand
and
an
unfailing
command
of
every
womanly
art
and
grace
oh
i
watched
you
well
need
i
add
sly
puss
that
i
admired
you
too
your
children
will
be
happy
but
not
spoilt
with
your
tenderness
lapping
them
round
and
the
clear
light
of
your
reason
playing
softly
on
them
tell
louis
the
truth
about
my
going
away
but
find
some
decent
excuse
for
your
who
seems
to
act
as
steward
for
the
establishment
and
be
careful
to
do
the
same
for
your
family
a
true
provencal
version
of
the
harlowe
family
felipe
does
not
know
why
i
left
and
he
will
never
know
if
he
asks
i
shall
contrive
to
find
some
colorable
pretext
probably
that
you
were
jealous
of
me
forgive
me
this
little
conventional
fib
i
write
in
haste
as
i
want
you
to
get
this
at
and
the
postilion
who
has
undertaken
to
convey
it
to
you
is
here
refreshing
himself
while
he
waits
many
kisses
to
my
dear
little
godson
be
sure
you
come
to
chantepleurs
in
october
i
shall
be
alone
there
all
the
time
that
macumer
is
away
in
sardinia
where
he
is
designing
great
improvements
in
his
estate
at
least
that
is
his
plan
for
the
moment
and
his
pet
vanity
consists
in
having
a
plan
then
he
feels
that
he
has
a
will
of
his
own
and
this
makes
him
very
uneasy
when
he
unfolds
it
to
me
xxxvi
the
vicomtesse
de
to
the
baronne
de
macumer
dear
no
words
can
express
the
astonishment
of
all
our
party
when
at
luncheon
we
were
told
that
you
had
both
gone
and
above
all
when
the
postilion
who
took
you
to
marseilles
handed
me
your
mad
letter
why
naughty
child
it
was
of
your
happiness
and
nothing
else
that
made
the
theme
of
those
talks
below
the
rock
on
the
louise
seat
and
you
had
not
the
faintest
justification
for
objecting
to
them
my
sentence
on
you
is
that
you
return
here
at
my
first
summons
in
that
horrid
letter
scribbled
on
the
inn
paper
you
did
not
tell
me
what
would
be
your
next
stopping
place
so
i
must
address
this
to
chantepleurs
listen
to
me
dear
sister
of
my
heart
know
first
that
my
mind
is
set
on
your
happiness
your
husband
dear
louise
commands
respect
not
only
by
his
natural
gravity
and
dignified
expression
but
also
because
he
somehow
impresses
one
with
the
splendid
power
revealed
in
his
piquant
plainness
and
in
the
fire
of
his
velvet
eyes
and
you
will
understand
that
it
was
some
little
time
before
i
could
meet
him
on
those
easy
terms
which
are
almost
necessary
for
intimate
conversation
further
this
man
has
been
prime
minister
and
he
idolizes
you
whence
it
follows
that
he
must
be
a
profound
dissembler
to
fish
up
secrets
therefore
from
the
rocky
caverns
of
this
diplomatic
soul
is
a
work
demanding
a
skilful
hand
no
less
than
a
ready
brain
nevertheless
i
succeeded
at
last
without
rousing
my
victim
suspicions
in
discovering
many
things
of
which
you
my
pet
have
no
conception
you
know
that
between
us
two
my
part
is
rather
that
of
reason
yours
of
imagination
i
personify
sober
duty
you
reckless
love
it
has
pleased
fate
to
continue
in
our
lives
this
contrast
in
character
which
was
imperceptible
to
all
except
ourselves
i
am
a
simple
country
vicountess
very
ambitious
and
making
it
her
task
to
lead
her
family
on
the
road
to
prosperity
on
the
other
hand
macumer
late
duc
de
soria
has
a
name
in
the
world
and
you
a
duchess
by
right
reign
in
paris
where
reigning
is
no
easy
matter
even
for
kings
you
have
a
considerable
fortune
which
will
be
doubled
if
macumer
carries
out
his
projects
for
developing
his
great
estates
in
sardinia
the
resources
of
which
are
matter
of
common
talk
at
marseilles
deny
if
you
can
that
if
either
has
the
right
to
be
jealous
it
is
not
you
but
thank
god
we
have
both
hearts
generous
enough
to
place
our
friendship
beyond
reach
of
such
vulgar
pettiness
i
know
you
dear
i
know
that
ere
now
you
are
ashamed
of
having
fled
but
do
suppose
that
your
flight
will
save
you
from
a
single
word
of
discourse
which
i
had
prepared
for
your
benefit
beneath
the
rock
read
carefully
then
i
beg
of
you
what
i
say
for
it
concerns
you
even
more
closely
than
macumer
though
he
also
enters
largely
into
my
sermon
firstly
my
dear
you
do
not
love
him
before
two
years
are
over
you
will
be
sick
of
adoration
you
will
never
look
on
felipe
as
a
husband
to
you
he
will
always
be
the
lover
whom
you
can
play
with
for
that
is
how
all
women
treat
their
lovers
you
do
not
look
up
to
him
or
reverence
or
worship
him
as
a
woman
should
the
god
of
her
idolatry
you
see
i
have
made
a
study
of
love
my
sweet
and
more
than
once
have
i
taken
soundings
in
the
depth
of
my
own
heart
now
as
the
result
of
a
careful
diagnosis
of
your
case
i
can
say
with
confidence
this
is
not
love
yes
dear
queen
of
paris
you
can
not
escape
the
destiny
of
all
queens
the
day
will
come
when
you
long
to
be
treated
as
a
to
be
mastered
and
swept
off
your
feet
by
a
strong
man
one
who
will
not
prostrate
himself
in
adoration
before
you
but
will
seize
your
arm
roughly
in
a
fit
of
jealousy
macumer
loves
you
too
fondly
ever
to
be
able
either
to
resist
you
or
find
fault
with
you
a
single
glance
from
you
a
single
coaxing
word
would
melt
his
sternest
resolution
sooner
or
later
you
will
learn
to
scorn
this
excessive
devotion
he
spoils
you
alas
just
as
i
used
to
spoil
you
at
the
convent
for
you
are
a
most
bewitching
woman
and
there
is
no
escaping
your
charms
worse
than
all
you
are
candid
and
it
often
happens
that
our
happiness
depends
on
certain
social
hypocrisies
to
which
you
will
never
stoop
for
instance
society
will
not
tolerate
a
frank
display
of
the
wife
power
over
her
husband
the
convention
is
that
a
man
must
no
more
show
himself
the
lover
of
his
wife
however
passionately
he
adores
her
than
a
married
woman
may
play
the
part
of
a
mistress
this
rule
you
both
disregard
in
the
first
place
my
child
from
what
you
have
yourself
told
me
it
is
clear
that
the
one
unpardonable
sin
in
society
is
to
be
happy
if
happiness
exists
no
one
must
know
of
it
but
this
is
a
small
point
what
seems
to
me
important
is
that
the
perfect
equality
which
reigns
between
lovers
ought
never
to
appear
in
the
case
of
husband
and
wife
under
pain
of
undermining
the
whole
fabric
of
society
and
entailing
terrible
disasters
if
it
is
painful
to
see
a
man
whom
nature
has
made
a
nonentity
how
much
worse
is
the
spectacle
of
a
man
of
parts
brought
to
that
position
before
very
long
you
will
have
reduced
macumer
to
the
mere
shadow
of
a
man
he
will
cease
to
have
a
will
and
character
of
his
own
and
become
mere
clay
in
your
hands
you
will
have
so
completely
moulded
him
to
your
likeness
that
your
household
will
consist
of
only
one
person
instead
of
two
and
that
one
necessarily
imperfect
you
will
regret
it
bitterly
but
when
at
last
you
deign
to
open
your
eyes
the
evil
will
be
past
cure
do
what
we
will
women
do
not
and
never
will
possess
the
qualities
which
are
characteristic
of
men
and
these
qualities
are
absolutely
indispensable
to
family
life
already
macumer
blinded
though
he
is
has
a
dim
foreshadowing
of
this
future
he
feels
himself
less
a
man
through
his
love
his
visit
to
sardinia
is
a
proof
to
me
that
he
hopes
by
this
temporary
separation
to
succeed
in
recovering
his
old
self
you
never
scruple
to
use
the
power
which
his
love
has
placed
in
your
hand
your
position
of
vantage
may
be
read
in
a
gesture
a
look
a
tone
oh
darling
how
truly
are
you
the
mad
wanton
your
mother
called
you
you
do
not
question
i
fancy
that
i
am
greatly
louis
superior
well
i
would
ask
you
have
you
ever
heard
me
contradict
him
am
i
not
always
in
the
presence
of
others
the
wife
who
respects
in
him
the
authority
of
the
family
hypocrisy
you
will
say
well
listen
to
me
it
is
true
that
if
i
want
to
give
him
any
advice
which
i
think
may
be
of
use
to
him
i
wait
for
the
quiet
and
seclusion
of
our
bedroom
to
explain
what
i
think
and
wish
but
i
assure
you
sweetheart
that
even
there
i
never
arrogate
to
myself
the
place
of
mentor
if
i
did
not
remain
in
private
the
same
submissive
wife
that
i
appear
to
others
he
would
lose
confidence
in
himself
dear
the
good
we
do
to
others
is
spoilt
unless
we
efface
ourselves
so
completely
that
those
we
help
have
no
sense
of
inferiority
there
is
a
wonderful
sweetness
in
these
hidden
sacrifices
and
what
a
triumph
for
me
in
your
unsuspecting
praises
of
louis
there
can
be
no
doubt
also
that
the
happiness
the
comfort
the
hope
of
the
last
two
years
have
restored
what
misfortune
hardship
solitude
and
despondency
has
robbed
him
of
this
then
is
the
of
my
observations
at
the
present
moment
you
love
in
felipe
not
your
husband
but
yourself
there
is
truth
in
your
father
words
concealed
by
the
of
your
passion
lies
all
the
great
lady
selfishness
ah
my
child
how
i
must
love
you
to
speak
such
bitter
truths
let
me
tell
you
if
you
will
promise
never
to
breathe
a
word
of
this
to
the
baron
the
end
of
our
talk
we
had
been
singing
your
praises
in
every
key
for
he
soon
discovered
that
i
loved
you
like
a
sister
and
having
insensibly
brought
him
to
a
confidential
mood
i
ventured
to
say
louise
has
never
yet
had
to
struggle
with
life
she
has
been
the
spoilt
child
of
fortune
and
she
might
yet
have
to
pay
for
this
were
you
not
there
to
act
the
part
of
father
as
well
as
lover
ah
but
is
it
possible
he
broke
off
abruptly
like
a
man
who
sees
himself
on
the
edge
of
a
precipice
but
the
exclamation
was
enough
for
me
no
doubt
if
you
had
stayed
he
would
have
spoken
more
freely
later
my
sweet
think
of
the
day
awaiting
you
when
your
husband
strength
will
be
exhausted
when
pleasure
will
have
turned
to
satiety
and
he
sees
himself
i
will
not
say
degraded
but
shorn
of
his
proper
dignity
before
you
the
stings
of
conscience
will
then
waken
a
sort
of
remorse
in
him
all
the
more
painful
for
you
because
you
will
feel
yourself
responsible
and
you
will
end
by
despising
the
man
whom
you
have
not
accustomed
yourself
to
respect
remember
too
that
scorn
with
a
woman
is
only
the
earliest
phase
of
hatred
you
are
too
noble
and
generous
i
know
ever
to
forget
the
sacrifices
which
felipe
has
made
for
you
but
what
further
sacrifices
will
be
left
for
him
to
make
when
he
has
so
to
speak
served
up
himself
at
the
first
banquet
woe
to
the
man
as
to
the
woman
who
has
left
no
desire
unsatisfied
all
is
over
then
to
our
shame
or
our
glory
the
point
is
too
nice
for
me
to
decide
it
is
of
love
alone
that
women
are
insatiable
oh
louise
change
yet
while
there
is
still
time
if
you
would
only
adopt
the
same
course
with
macumer
that
i
have
done
with
you
might
rouse
the
sleeping
lion
in
your
husband
who
is
made
of
the
stuff
of
heroes
one
might
almost
say
that
you
grudge
him
his
greatness
would
you
feel
no
pride
in
using
your
power
for
other
ends
than
your
own
gratification
in
awakening
the
genius
of
a
gifted
man
as
i
in
raising
to
a
higher
level
one
of
merely
common
parts
had
you
remained
with
us
i
should
still
have
written
this
letter
for
in
talking
you
might
have
cut
me
short
or
got
the
better
of
me
with
your
sharp
tongue
but
i
know
that
you
will
read
this
thoughtfully
and
weigh
my
warnings
dear
heart
you
have
everything
in
life
to
make
you
happy
do
not
spoil
your
chances
return
to
paris
i
entreat
you
as
soon
as
macumer
comes
back
the
engrossing
claims
of
society
of
which
i
complained
are
necessary
for
both
of
you
otherwise
you
would
spend
your
life
in
mutual
a
married
woman
ought
not
to
be
too
lavish
of
herself
the
mother
of
a
family
who
never
gives
her
household
an
opportunity
of
missing
her
runs
the
risk
of
palling
on
them
if
i
have
several
children
as
i
trust
for
my
own
sake
i
may
i
assure
you
i
shall
make
a
point
of
reserving
to
myself
certain
hours
which
shall
be
held
sacred
even
to
one
children
one
presence
should
not
be
a
matter
of
daily
bread
farewell
my
dear
jealous
soul
do
you
know
that
many
women
would
be
highly
flattered
at
having
roused
this
passing
pang
in
you
alas
i
can
only
mourn
for
what
is
not
mother
in
me
is
your
dear
friend
a
thousand
loves
make
what
excuse
you
will
for
leaving
if
you
are
not
sure
of
macumer
i
am
of
louis
xxxvii
the
baronne
de
macumer
to
the
vicomtesse
de
genoa
my
beloved
beauty
i
was
bitten
with
the
fancy
to
see
something
of
italy
and
i
am
delighted
at
having
carried
off
macumer
whose
plans
in
regard
to
sardinia
are
postponed
this
country
is
simple
ravishing
the
churches
above
all
the
chapels
have
a
seductive
bewitching
air
which
must
make
every
female
protestant
yearn
after
catholicism
macumer
has
been
received
with
acclamation
and
they
are
all
delighted
to
have
made
an
italian
of
so
distinguished
a
man
felipe
could
have
the
sardinian
embassy
at
paris
if
i
cared
about
it
for
i
am
made
much
of
at
court
if
you
write
address
your
letters
to
florence
i
have
not
time
now
to
go
into
any
details
but
i
will
tell
you
the
story
of
our
travels
whenever
you
come
to
paris
we
only
remain
here
a
week
and
then
go
on
to
florence
taking
leghorn
on
the
way
we
shall
stay
a
month
in
tuscany
and
a
month
at
naples
so
as
to
reach
rome
in
november
thence
we
return
home
by
venice
where
we
shall
spend
the
first
fortnight
of
december
and
arrive
in
paris
milan
and
turin
for
january
our
journey
is
a
perfect
honeymoon
the
sight
of
new
places
gives
fresh
life
to
our
passion
macumer
did
not
know
italy
at
all
and
we
have
begun
with
that
splendid
cornice
road
which
might
be
the
work
of
fairy
architects
darling
do
be
angry
if
i
do
write
it
is
impossible
to
get
a
minute
to
oneself
in
traveling
my
whole
time
is
taken
up
with
seeing
admiring
and
realizing
my
impressions
but
not
a
word
to
you
of
these
till
memory
has
given
them
their
proper
atmosphere
xxxviii
the
vicomtesse
de
to
the
baronne
de
macumer
september
my
dear
there
is
lying
for
you
at
chantepleurs
a
full
reply
to
the
letter
you
wrote
me
from
marseilles
this
honeymoon
journey
so
far
from
diminishing
the
fears
i
there
expressed
makes
me
beg
of
you
to
get
my
letter
sent
on
from
nivernais
the
government
it
is
said
are
resolved
on
dissolution
this
is
unlucky
for
the
crown
since
the
last
session
of
this
loyal
parliament
would
have
been
devoted
to
the
passing
of
laws
essential
to
the
consolidation
of
its
power
and
it
is
not
less
so
for
us
as
louis
will
not
be
forty
till
the
end
of
fortunately
however
my
father
has
agreed
to
stand
and
he
will
resign
his
seat
when
the
right
moment
arrives
your
godson
has
found
out
how
to
walk
without
his
godmother
help
he
is
altogether
delicious
and
begins
to
make
the
prettiest
little
signs
to
me
which
bring
home
to
one
that
here
is
really
a
thinking
being
not
a
mere
animal
or
sucking
machine
his
smiles
are
full
of
meaning
i
have
been
so
successful
in
my
profession
of
nurse
that
i
shall
wean
armand
in
december
a
year
at
the
breast
is
quite
enough
children
who
are
suckled
longer
are
said
to
grow
stupid
and
i
am
all
for
popular
sayings
you
must
make
a
tremendous
sensation
in
italy
my
fair
one
with
the
golden
locks
a
thousand
loves
xxxix
the
baronne
de
macumer
to
the
vicomtesse
de
your
atrocious
letter
has
reached
me
here
the
steward
having
forwarded
it
by
my
orders
oh
renee
but
i
will
spare
you
the
outburst
of
my
wounded
feelings
and
simply
tell
you
the
effect
your
letter
produced
we
had
just
returned
from
a
delightful
reception
given
in
our
honor
by
the
ambassador
where
i
appeared
in
all
my
glory
and
macumer
was
completely
carried
away
in
a
frenzy
of
love
which
i
could
not
describe
then
i
read
him
your
horrible
answer
to
my
letter
and
i
read
it
sobbing
at
the
risk
of
making
a
fright
of
myself
my
dear
arab
fell
at
my
feet
declaring
that
you
raved
then
he
carried
me
off
to
the
balcony
of
the
palace
where
we
are
staying
from
which
we
have
a
view
over
part
of
the
city
there
he
spoke
to
me
words
worthy
of
the
magnificent
moonlight
scene
which
lay
stretched
before
us
we
both
speak
italian
now
and
his
love
told
in
that
voluptuous
tongue
so
admirably
adapted
to
the
expression
of
passion
sounded
in
my
ears
like
the
most
exquisite
poetry
he
swore
that
even
were
you
right
in
your
predictions
he
would
not
exchange
for
a
lifetime
a
single
one
of
our
blessed
nights
or
charming
mornings
at
this
reckoning
he
has
already
lived
a
thousand
years
he
is
content
to
have
me
for
his
mistress
and
would
claim
no
other
title
than
that
of
lover
so
proud
and
pleased
is
he
to
see
himself
every
day
the
chosen
of
my
heart
that
were
heaven
to
offer
him
the
alternative
between
living
as
you
would
have
us
to
for
another
thirty
years
with
five
children
and
five
years
spent
amid
the
dear
roses
of
our
love
he
would
not
hesitate
he
would
take
my
love
such
as
it
is
and
death
while
he
was
whispering
this
in
my
ear
his
arm
round
me
my
head
resting
on
his
shoulder
the
cries
of
a
bat
surprised
by
an
owl
disturbed
us
this
struck
me
with
such
terror
that
felipe
carried
me
to
my
bed
but
do
be
alarmed
though
this
augury
of
evil
still
resounds
in
my
soul
i
am
quite
myself
this
morning
as
soon
as
i
was
up
i
went
to
felipe
and
kneeling
before
him
my
eyes
fixed
on
his
his
hands
clasped
in
mine
i
said
to
him
my
love
i
am
a
child
and
renee
may
be
right
after
all
it
may
be
only
your
love
that
i
love
in
you
but
at
least
i
can
assure
you
that
this
is
the
one
feeling
of
my
heart
and
that
i
love
you
as
it
is
given
me
to
love
but
if
there
be
aught
in
me
in
my
lightest
thought
or
deed
which
jars
on
your
wishes
or
conception
of
me
i
implore
you
to
tell
me
to
say
what
it
is
it
will
be
a
joy
to
me
to
hear
you
and
to
take
your
eyes
as
the
of
my
life
renee
has
frightened
me
for
she
is
a
true
friend
macumer
could
not
find
voice
to
reply
tears
choked
him
i
can
thank
you
now
renee
but
for
your
letter
i
should
not
have
known
the
depths
of
love
in
my
noble
kingly
macumer
rome
is
the
city
of
love
it
is
there
that
passion
should
celebrate
its
feast
with
art
and
religion
as
confederates
at
venice
we
shall
find
the
duc
and
duchesse
de
soria
if
you
write
address
now
to
paris
for
we
shall
leave
rome
in
three
days
the
ambassador
was
a
farewell
party
dear
silly
child
your
letter
only
shows
that
you
knew
nothing
of
love
except
theoretically
learn
then
that
love
is
a
quickening
force
which
may
produce
fruits
so
diverse
that
no
theory
can
embrace
or
them
a
word
this
for
my
little
professor
with
her
armor
of
stays
xl
the
comtesse
de
to
the
baronne
de
macumer
january
my
father
has
been
elected
to
the
chamber
my
is
dead
and
i
am
on
the
point
of
my
second
confinement
these
are
the
chief
events
marking
the
end
of
the
year
for
us
i
mention
them
at
once
lest
the
sight
of
the
black
seal
should
frighten
you
my
dear
your
letter
from
rome
made
my
flesh
creep
you
are
nothing
but
a
pair
of
children
felipe
is
either
a
dissembling
diplomat
or
else
his
love
for
you
is
the
love
a
man
might
have
for
a
courtesan
on
whom
he
squanders
his
all
knowing
all
the
time
that
she
is
false
to
him
enough
of
this
you
say
i
rave
so
i
had
better
hold
my
tongue
only
this
would
i
say
from
the
comparison
of
our
two
very
different
destinies
i
draw
this
harsh
moral
love
not
if
you
would
be
loved
my
dear
when
louis
was
elected
to
the
provincial
council
he
received
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honor
that
is
now
nearly
three
years
ago
and
as
my
father
whom
you
will
no
doubt
see
in
paris
during
the
course
of
the
session
has
asked
the
rank
of
officer
of
the
legion
for
his
i
want
to
know
if
you
will
do
me
the
kindness
to
take
in
hand
the
bigwig
whoever
he
may
be
to
whom
this
patronage
belongs
and
to
keep
an
eye
upon
the
little
affair
but
whatever
you
do
do
get
entangled
in
the
concerns
of
my
honored
father
the
comte
de
maucombe
is
fishing
for
the
title
of
marquis
for
himself
but
keep
your
good
services
for
me
please
when
louis
is
a
deputy
next
winter
that
is
we
shall
come
to
paris
and
then
we
will
move
heaven
and
earth
to
get
some
government
appointment
for
him
so
that
we
may
be
able
to
save
our
income
by
living
on
his
salary
my
father
sits
between
the
centre
and
the
right
a
title
will
content
him
our
family
was
distinguished
even
in
the
days
of
king
rene
and
charles
will
hardly
say
no
to
a
maucombe
but
what
i
fear
is
that
my
father
may
take
it
into
his
head
to
ask
some
favor
for
my
younger
brother
now
if
the
marquisate
is
dangled
out
of
his
reach
he
will
have
no
thoughts
to
spare
from
himself
january
ah
louise
i
have
been
in
hell
if
i
can
bear
to
tell
you
of
my
anguish
it
is
because
you
are
another
self
even
so
i
do
know
whether
i
shall
ever
be
able
to
live
again
in
thought
those
five
ghastly
days
the
mere
word
convulsions
makes
my
very
heart
sick
five
days
to
me
they
were
five
centuries
of
torture
a
mother
who
has
not
been
through
this
martyrdom
does
not
know
what
suffering
is
so
frenzied
was
i
that
i
even
envied
you
who
never
had
a
child
the
evening
before
that
terrible
day
the
weather
was
close
almost
hot
and
i
thought
my
little
armand
was
affected
by
it
generally
so
sweet
and
caressing
he
was
peevish
cried
for
nothing
wanted
to
play
and
then
broke
his
toys
perhaps
this
sort
of
fractiousness
is
the
usual
sign
of
approaching
illness
with
children
while
i
was
wondering
about
it
i
noticed
armand
cheeks
flush
but
this
i
set
down
to
teething
for
he
is
cutting
four
large
teeth
at
once
so
i
put
him
to
bed
beside
me
and
kept
constantly
waking
through
the
night
he
was
a
little
feverish
but
not
enough
to
make
me
uneasy
my
mind
being
still
full
of
the
teething
towards
morning
he
cried
mamma
and
asked
by
signs
for
something
to
drink
but
the
cry
was
spasmodic
and
there
were
convulsive
twitchings
in
the
limbs
which
turned
me
to
ice
i
jumped
out
of
bed
to
fetch
him
a
drink
imagine
my
horror
when
on
my
handing
him
the
cup
he
remained
motionless
only
repeating
mamma
in
that
strange
unfamiliar
voice
which
was
indeed
by
this
time
hardly
a
voice
at
all
i
took
his
hand
but
it
did
not
respond
to
my
pressure
it
was
quite
stiff
i
put
the
cup
to
his
lips
the
poor
little
fellow
gulped
down
three
or
four
mouthfuls
in
a
convulsive
manner
that
was
terrible
to
see
and
the
water
made
a
strange
sound
in
his
throat
he
clung
to
me
desperately
and
i
saw
his
eyes
roll
as
though
some
hidden
force
within
were
pulling
at
them
till
only
the
whites
were
visible
his
limbs
were
turning
rigid
i
screamed
aloud
and
louis
came
a
doctor
quick
he
is
dying
i
cried
louis
vanished
and
my
poor
armand
again
gasped
mamma
mamma
the
next
moment
he
lost
all
consciousness
of
his
mother
existence
the
pretty
veins
on
his
forehead
swelled
and
the
convulsions
began
for
a
whole
hour
before
the
doctors
came
i
held
in
my
arms
that
merry
baby
all
lilies
and
roses
the
blossom
of
my
life
my
pride
and
my
joy
lifeless
as
a
piece
of
wood
and
his
eyes
i
can
not
think
of
them
without
horror
my
pretty
armand
was
a
mere
mummy
black
shriveled
misshapen
a
doctor
two
doctors
brought
from
marseilles
by
louis
hovered
about
like
birds
of
ill
omen
it
made
me
shudder
to
look
at
them
one
spoke
of
brain
fever
the
other
saw
nothing
but
an
ordinary
case
of
convulsions
in
infancy
our
own
country
doctor
seemed
to
me
to
have
the
most
sense
for
he
offered
no
opinion
it
teething
said
the
second
fever
said
the
first
finally
it
was
agreed
to
put
leeches
on
his
neck
and
ice
on
his
head
it
seemed
to
me
like
death
to
look
on
to
see
a
corpse
all
purple
or
black
and
not
a
cry
not
a
movement
from
this
creature
but
now
so
full
of
life
and
sound
it
was
horrible
at
one
moment
i
lost
my
head
and
gave
a
sort
of
hysterical
laugh
as
i
saw
the
pretty
neck
which
i
used
to
devour
with
kisses
with
the
leeches
feeding
on
it
and
his
darling
head
in
a
cap
of
ice
my
dear
we
had
to
cut
those
lovely
curls
of
which
we
were
so
proud
and
with
which
you
used
to
play
in
order
to
make
room
for
the
ice
the
convulsions
returned
every
ten
minutes
with
the
regularity
of
labor
pains
and
then
the
poor
baby
writhed
and
twisted
now
white
now
violet
his
supple
limbs
clattered
like
wood
as
they
struck
and
this
unconscious
flesh
was
the
being
who
smiled
and
prattled
and
used
to
say
mamma
at
the
thought
a
storm
of
agony
swept
tumultuously
over
my
soul
like
the
sea
tossing
in
a
hurricane
it
seemed
as
though
every
tie
which
binds
a
child
to
its
mother
heart
was
strained
to
rending
my
mother
who
might
have
given
me
help
advice
or
comfort
was
in
paris
mothers
it
is
my
belief
know
more
than
doctors
do
about
convulsions
after
four
days
and
nights
of
suspense
and
fear
which
almost
killed
me
the
doctors
were
unanimous
in
advising
the
application
of
a
horrid
ointment
which
would
produce
open
sores
sores
on
my
armand
who
only
five
days
before
was
playing
about
and
laughing
and
trying
to
say
godmother
i
would
not
have
it
done
preferring
to
trust
in
nature
louis
who
believes
in
doctors
scolded
me
a
man
remains
the
same
through
everything
but
there
are
moments
when
this
terrible
disease
takes
the
likeness
of
death
and
in
one
of
these
it
seemed
borne
in
upon
me
that
this
hateful
remedy
was
the
salvation
of
armand
louise
the
skin
was
so
dry
so
rough
and
parched
that
the
ointment
would
not
act
then
i
broke
into
weeping
and
my
tears
fell
so
long
and
so
fast
that
the
bedside
was
wet
through
and
the
doctors
were
at
dinner
seeing
myself
alone
with
the
child
i
stripped
him
of
all
medical
appliances
and
seizing
him
like
a
mad
woman
pressed
him
to
my
bosom
laying
my
forehead
against
his
and
beseeching
god
to
grant
him
the
life
which
i
was
striving
to
pass
into
his
veins
from
mine
for
some
minutes
i
held
him
thus
longing
to
die
with
him
so
that
neither
life
nor
death
might
part
us
dear
i
felt
the
limbs
relaxing
the
writhings
ceased
the
child
stirred
and
the
ghastly
corpselike
tints
faded
away
i
screamed
just
as
i
did
when
he
was
taken
ill
the
doctors
hurried
up
and
i
pointed
to
armand
he
is
saved
exclaimed
the
oldest
of
them
what
music
in
those
words
the
gates
of
heaven
opened
and
in
fact
two
hours
later
armand
came
back
to
life
but
i
was
utterly
crushed
and
it
was
only
the
healing
power
of
joy
which
saved
me
from
a
serious
illness
my
god
by
what
tortures
do
you
bind
a
mother
to
her
child
to
fasten
him
to
our
heart
need
the
nails
be
driven
into
the
very
quick
was
i
not
mother
enough
before
i
who
wept
tears
of
joy
over
his
broken
syllables
and
tottering
steps
who
spent
hours
together
planning
how
best
to
perform
my
duty
and
fit
myself
for
the
sweet
post
of
mother
why
these
horrors
these
ghastly
scenes
for
a
mother
who
already
idolized
her
child
as
i
write
our
little
armand
is
playing
shouting
laughing
what
can
be
the
cause
of
this
terrible
disease
with
children
vainly
do
i
try
to
puzzle
it
out
remembering
that
i
am
again
with
child
is
it
teething
is
it
some
peculiar
process
in
the
brain
is
there
something
wrong
with
the
nervous
system
of
children
who
are
subject
to
convulsions
all
these
thoughts
disquiet
me
in
view
alike
of
the
present
and
the
future
our
country
doctor
holds
to
the
theory
of
nervous
trouble
produced
by
teething
i
would
give
every
tooth
in
my
head
to
see
little
armand
all
through
the
sight
of
one
of
those
little
white
pearls
peeping
out
of
the
swollen
gum
brings
a
cold
sweat
over
me
now
the
heroism
with
which
the
little
angel
bore
his
sufferings
proves
to
me
that
he
will
be
his
mother
son
a
look
from
him
goes
to
my
very
heart
medical
science
can
give
no
satisfactory
explanation
as
to
the
origin
of
this
sort
of
tetanus
which
passes
off
as
rapidly
as
it
comes
on
and
can
apparently
be
neither
guarded
against
nor
cured
one
thing
alone
as
i
said
before
is
certain
that
it
is
hell
for
a
mother
to
see
her
child
in
convulsions
how
passionately
do
i
clasp
him
to
my
heart
i
could
walk
for
ever
with
him
in
my
arms
to
have
suffered
all
this
only
six
weeks
before
my
confinement
made
it
much
worse
i
feared
for
the
coming
child
farewell
my
dear
beloved
do
wish
for
a
child
there
is
the
sum
and
substance
of
my
letter
xli
the
baronne
de
macumer
to
the
vicomtesse
de
paris
poor
sweet
macumer
and
i
forgave
you
all
your
naughtiness
when
we
heard
of
your
terrible
trouble
i
thrilled
with
pain
as
i
read
the
details
of
the
double
agony
and
there
seem
compensations
now
in
being
childless
i
am
writing
at
once
to
tell
you
that
louis
has
been
promoted
he
can
now
wear
the
ribbon
of
an
officer
of
the
legion
you
are
a
lucky
woman
renee
and
you
will
probably
have
a
little
girl
since
that
used
to
be
your
wish
the
marriage
of
my
brother
with
mlle
de
mortsauf
was
celebrated
on
our
return
our
gracious
king
who
really
is
extraordinarily
kind
has
given
my
brother
the
reversion
of
the
post
of
first
gentleman
of
the
chamber
which
his
now
fills
on
the
one
condition
that
the
scutcheon
of
the
mortsaufs
should
be
placed
side
by
side
with
that
of
the
lenoncourts
the
office
ought
to
go
with
the
title
he
said
to
the
duc
de
my
father
is
justified
a
without
the
help
of
my
fortune
nothing
of
all
this
could
have
taken
place
my
father
and
mother
came
from
madrid
for
the
wedding
and
return
there
after
the
reception
which
i
give
for
the
bride
and
bridegroom
the
carnival
will
be
a
very
gay
one
the
duc
and
duchesse
de
soria
are
in
paris
and
their
presence
makes
me
a
little
uneasy
marie
heredia
is
certainly
one
of
the
most
beautiful
women
in
europe
and
i
do
like
the
way
felipe
looks
at
her
therefore
i
am
doubly
lavish
of
sweetness
and
caresses
every
look
and
gesture
speak
the
words
which
i
am
careful
my
lips
should
not
utter
could
not
love
like
this
heaven
knows
how
lovely
and
fascinating
i
am
yesterday
mme
de
maufrigneuse
said
to
me
dear
child
who
can
compete
with
you
then
i
keep
felipe
so
well
amused
that
his
must
seem
as
lively
as
a
spanish
cow
in
comparison
i
am
the
less
sorry
that
a
little
abencerrage
is
not
on
his
way
because
the
duchess
will
no
doubt
stay
in
paris
over
her
confinement
and
she
wo
be
a
beauty
any
longer
if
the
baby
is
a
boy
it
will
be
called
felipe
in
honor
of
the
exile
an
unkind
chance
has
decreed
that
i
shall
a
second
time
serve
as
godmother
dear
i
shall
go
to
chantepleurs
early
this
year
for
our
italian
tour
was
shockingly
expensive
i
shall
leave
about
the
end
of
march
and
retire
to
economize
in
nivenais
besides
i
am
tired
of
paris
felipe
sighs
as
i
do
after
the
beautiful
quiet
of
the
park
our
cool
meadows
and
our
loire
with
its
sparkling
sands
peerless
among
rivers
chantepleurs
will
seem
delightful
to
me
after
the
pomps
and
vanities
of
italy
for
after
all
splendor
becomes
wearisome
and
a
lover
glance
has
more
beauty
than
a
or
a
we
shall
expect
you
there
do
be
afraid
that
i
shall
be
jealous
again
you
are
free
to
take
what
soundings
you
please
in
heart
and
fish
up
all
the
interjections
and
doubts
you
can
i
am
supremely
indifferent
since
that
day
at
rome
felipe
love
for
me
has
grown
he
told
me
yesterday
he
is
looking
over
my
shoulder
now
that
his
the
princess
heredia
his
destined
bride
of
old
the
dream
of
his
youth
had
no
brains
oh
my
dear
i
am
worse
than
a
if
you
knew
what
joy
that
slighting
remark
gave
me
i
have
pointed
out
to
felipe
that
she
does
not
speak
french
correctly
she
says
for
for
for
she
is
beautiful
of
course
but
quite
without
charm
or
the
slightest
scintilla
of
wit
when
a
compliment
is
paid
her
she
looks
at
you
as
though
she
did
know
what
to
do
with
such
a
strange
thing
felipe
being
what
he
is
could
not
have
lived
two
months
with
marie
after
his
marriage
don
fernand
the
duc
de
soria
suits
her
very
well
he
has
generous
instincts
but
it
easy
to
see
he
has
been
a
spoilt
child
i
am
tempted
to
be
naughty
and
make
you
laugh
but
i
wo
draw
the
long
bow
ever
so
much
love
darling
xlii
renee
to
louise
my
little
girl
is
two
months
old
she
is
called
and
has
for
godmother
and
godfather
my
mother
and
an
old
of
louis
as
soon
as
i
possibly
can
i
shall
start
for
my
visit
to
chantepleurs
since
you
are
not
afraid
of
a
nursing
mother
your
godson
can
say
your
name
now
he
calls
it
for
he
ca
say
properly
you
will
be
quite
delighted
with
him
he
has
got
all
his
teeth
and
eats
meat
now
like
a
big
boy
he
is
all
over
the
place
trotting
about
like
a
little
mouse
but
i
watch
him
all
the
time
with
anxious
eyes
and
it
makes
me
miserable
that
i
can
not
keep
him
by
me
when
i
am
laid
up
the
time
is
more
than
usually
long
with
me
as
the
doctors
consider
some
special
precautions
necessary
alas
my
child
habit
does
not
inure
one
to
there
are
the
same
old
discomforts
and
misgivings
however
do
show
this
to
felipe
this
little
girl
takes
after
me
and
she
may
yet
cut
out
your
armand
my
father
thought
felipe
looking
very
thin
and
my
dear
pet
also
not
quite
so
blooming
yet
the
duc
and
duchesse
de
soria
have
gone
not
a
loophole
for
jealousy
is
left
is
there
any
trouble
which
you
are
hiding
from
me
your
letter
is
neither
so
long
nor
so
full
of
loving
thoughts
as
usual
is
this
only
a
whim
of
my
dear
whimsical
friend
i
am
running
on
too
long
my
nurse
is
angry
with
me
for
writing
and
mlle
athenais
de
wants
her
dinner
farewell
then
write
me
some
nice
long
letters
xliii
mme
de
macumer
to
the
comtesse
de
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
my
dear
renee
i
have
been
alone
and
crying
i
was
sitting
under
a
willow
on
a
wooden
bench
by
the
side
of
the
long
chantepleurs
marsh
the
view
there
is
charming
but
it
needs
some
merry
children
to
complete
it
and
i
wait
for
you
i
have
been
married
nearly
three
years
and
no
child
the
thought
of
your
quiver
full
drove
me
to
explore
my
heart
and
this
is
what
i
find
there
oh
if
i
had
to
suffer
a
what
renee
suffered
when
my
godson
was
born
if
i
had
to
see
my
child
in
convulsions
even
so
would
to
god
that
i
might
have
a
cherub
of
my
own
like
your
athenais
i
can
see
her
from
here
in
my
mind
eye
and
i
know
she
is
beautiful
as
the
day
for
you
tell
me
nothing
about
her
that
is
just
like
my
renee
i
believe
you
divine
my
trouble
each
time
my
hopes
are
disappointed
i
fall
a
prey
for
some
days
to
the
blackest
melancholy
then
i
compose
sad
elegies
when
shall
i
embroider
little
caps
and
sew
lace
edgings
to
encircle
a
tiny
head
when
choose
the
cambric
for
the
shall
i
never
hear
baby
lips
shout
mamma
and
have
my
dress
pulled
by
a
teasing
despot
whom
my
heart
adores
are
there
to
be
no
wheelmarks
of
a
little
carriage
on
the
gravel
no
broken
toys
littered
about
the
courtyard
shall
i
never
visit
the
as
mothers
do
to
buy
swords
and
dolls
and
and
will
it
never
be
mine
to
watch
the
unfolding
of
a
precious
life
another
felipe
only
more
dear
i
would
have
a
son
if
only
to
learn
how
a
lover
can
be
more
to
one
in
his
second
self
my
park
and
castle
are
cold
and
desolate
to
me
a
childless
woman
is
a
monstrosity
of
nature
we
exist
only
to
be
mothers
oh
my
sage
in
woman
livery
how
well
you
have
conned
the
book
of
life
everywhere
too
barrenness
is
a
dismal
thing
my
life
is
a
little
too
much
like
one
of
gessner
or
florian
sheepfolds
which
rivarol
longed
to
see
invaded
by
a
wolf
i
too
have
it
in
me
to
make
sacrifices
there
are
forces
in
me
i
feel
which
felipe
has
no
use
for
and
if
i
am
not
to
be
a
mother
i
must
be
allowed
to
indulge
myself
in
some
romantic
sorrow
i
have
just
made
this
remark
to
my
belated
moor
and
it
brought
tears
to
his
eyes
he
can
not
stand
any
joking
on
his
love
so
i
let
him
off
easily
and
only
called
him
a
paladin
of
folly
at
times
i
am
seized
with
a
desire
to
go
on
pilgrimage
to
bear
my
longings
to
the
shrine
of
some
madonna
or
to
a
next
winter
i
shall
take
medical
advice
i
am
too
much
enraged
with
myself
to
write
more
xliv
the
same
to
the
same
paris
a
whole
year
passed
my
dear
without
a
letter
what
does
this
mean
i
am
a
little
hurt
do
you
suppose
that
your
louis
who
comes
to
see
me
almost
every
alternate
day
makes
up
for
you
it
is
not
enough
to
know
that
you
are
well
and
that
everything
prospers
with
you
for
i
love
you
renee
and
i
want
to
know
what
you
are
feeling
and
thinking
of
just
as
i
say
everything
to
you
at
the
risk
of
being
scolded
or
censured
or
misunderstood
your
silence
and
seclusion
in
the
country
at
the
time
when
you
might
be
in
paris
enjoying
all
the
parliamentary
honors
of
the
comte
de
cause
me
serious
anxiety
you
know
that
your
husband
gift
of
gab
and
unsparing
zeal
have
won
for
him
quite
a
position
here
and
he
will
doubtless
receive
some
very
good
post
when
the
session
is
over
pray
do
you
spend
your
life
writing
him
letters
of
advice
numa
was
not
so
far
removed
from
his
egeria
why
did
you
not
take
this
opportunity
of
seeing
paris
i
might
have
enjoyed
your
company
for
four
months
louis
told
me
yesterday
that
you
were
coming
to
fetch
him
and
would
have
your
third
confinement
in
paris
you
terrible
mother
gigogne
after
bombarding
louis
with
queries
exclamations
and
regrets
i
at
last
defeated
his
strategy
so
far
as
to
discover
that
his
the
godfather
of
athenais
is
very
now
i
believe
that
you
like
a
careful
mother
would
be
quite
equal
to
angling
with
the
member
speeches
and
fame
for
a
fat
legacy
from
your
husband
last
remaining
relative
on
the
mother
side
keep
your
mind
easy
my
renee
we
are
all
at
work
for
louis
lenoncourts
chaulieus
and
the
whole
band
of
mme
de
macumer
followers
martignac
will
probably
put
him
into
the
audit
department
but
if
you
wo
tell
me
why
you
bury
yourself
in
the
country
i
shall
be
cross
tell
me
are
you
afraid
that
the
political
wisdom
of
the
house
of
should
seem
to
centre
in
you
or
is
it
the
uncle
legacy
perhaps
you
were
afraid
you
would
be
less
to
your
children
in
paris
ah
what
i
would
give
to
know
whether
after
all
you
were
not
simply
too
vain
to
show
yourself
in
paris
for
the
first
time
in
your
present
condition
vain
thing
farewell
xlv
renee
to
louise
you
complain
of
my
silence
have
you
forgotten
then
those
two
little
brown
heads
at
once
my
subjects
and
my
tyrants
and
as
to
staying
at
home
you
have
yourself
hit
upon
several
of
my
reasons
apart
from
the
condition
of
our
dear
uncle
i
did
want
to
drag
with
me
to
paris
a
boy
of
four
and
a
little
girl
who
will
soon
be
three
when
i
am
again
expecting
my
confinement
i
had
no
intention
of
troubling
you
and
upsetting
your
husband
with
such
a
party
i
did
not
care
to
appear
looking
my
worst
in
the
brilliant
circle
over
which
you
preside
and
i
detest
life
in
hotels
and
lodgings
when
i
come
to
spend
the
session
in
paris
it
will
be
in
my
own
house
louis
uncle
when
he
heard
of
the
rank
his
had
received
made
me
a
present
of
two
hundred
thousand
francs
the
half
of
his
savings
with
which
to
buy
a
house
in
paris
and
i
have
charged
louis
to
find
one
in
your
neighborhood
my
mother
has
given
me
thirty
thousand
francs
for
the
furnishing
and
i
shall
do
my
best
not
to
disgrace
the
dear
sister
of
my
election
no
pun
intended
i
am
grateful
to
you
for
having
already
done
so
much
at
court
for
louis
but
though
de
bourmont
and
de
polignac
have
paid
him
the
compliment
of
asking
him
to
join
their
ministry
i
do
not
wish
so
conspicuous
a
place
for
him
it
would
commit
him
too
much
and
i
prefer
the
audit
office
because
it
is
permanent
our
affairs
here
are
in
very
good
hands
so
you
need
not
fear
as
soon
as
the
steward
has
mastered
the
details
i
will
come
and
support
louis
as
for
writing
long
letters
nowadays
how
can
i
this
one
in
which
i
want
to
describe
to
you
the
daily
routine
of
my
life
will
be
a
week
on
the
stocks
who
can
tell
but
armand
may
lay
hold
of
it
to
make
caps
for
his
regiments
drawn
up
on
my
carpet
or
vessels
for
the
fleets
which
sail
his
bath
a
single
day
will
serve
as
a
sample
of
the
rest
for
they
are
all
exactly
alike
and
their
characteristics
reduce
themselves
to
two
either
the
children
are
well
or
they
are
not
for
me
in
this
solitary
grange
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
hours
become
minutes
or
minutes
hours
according
to
the
children
health
if
i
have
some
delightful
hours
it
is
when
they
are
asleep
and
i
am
no
longer
needed
to
rock
the
one
or
soothe
the
other
with
stories
when
i
have
them
sleeping
by
my
side
i
say
to
myself
nothing
can
go
wrong
now
the
fact
is
my
sweet
every
mother
spends
her
time
so
soon
as
her
children
are
out
of
her
sight
in
imagining
dangers
for
them
perhaps
it
is
armand
seizing
the
razors
to
play
with
or
his
coat
taking
fire
or
a
snake
biting
him
or
he
might
tumble
in
running
and
start
an
abscess
on
his
head
or
he
might
drown
himself
in
a
pond
a
life
you
see
is
one
long
succession
of
dramas
now
soft
and
tender
now
terrible
not
an
hour
but
has
its
joys
and
fears
but
at
night
in
my
room
comes
the
hour
for
waking
dreams
when
i
plan
out
their
future
which
shines
brightly
in
the
smile
of
the
guardian
angel
watching
over
their
beds
sometimes
armand
calls
me
in
his
sleep
i
kiss
his
forehead
without
rousing
him
then
his
sister
feet
and
watch
them
both
lying
in
their
beauty
these
are
my
yesterday
it
must
have
been
our
guardian
angel
who
roused
me
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
summoned
me
in
fear
to
athenais
cradle
her
head
was
too
low
and
i
found
armand
all
uncovered
his
feet
purple
with
cold
darling
mother
he
cried
rousing
up
and
flinging
his
arms
round
me
there
dear
is
one
of
our
night
scenes
for
you
how
important
it
is
for
a
mother
to
have
her
children
by
her
side
at
night
it
is
not
for
a
nurse
however
careful
she
may
be
to
take
them
up
comfort
them
and
hush
them
to
sleep
again
when
some
horrid
nightmare
has
disturbed
them
for
they
have
their
dreams
and
the
task
of
explaining
away
one
of
those
dread
visions
of
the
night
is
the
more
arduous
because
the
child
is
scared
stupid
and
only
half
awake
it
is
a
mere
interlude
in
the
unconsciousness
of
slumber
in
this
way
i
have
come
to
sleep
so
lightly
that
i
can
see
my
little
pair
and
see
them
stirring
through
the
veil
of
my
eyelids
a
sigh
or
a
rustle
wakens
me
for
me
the
demon
of
convulsions
is
ever
crouching
by
their
beds
so
much
for
the
nights
with
the
first
twitter
of
the
birds
my
babies
begin
to
stir
through
the
mists
of
dispersing
sleep
their
chatter
blends
with
the
warblings
that
fill
the
morning
air
or
with
the
swallows
noisy
debates
little
cries
of
joy
or
woe
which
make
their
way
to
my
heart
rather
than
my
ears
while
nais
struggles
to
get
at
me
making
the
passage
from
her
cradle
to
my
bed
on
all
fours
or
with
staggering
steps
armand
climbs
up
with
the
agility
of
a
monkey
and
has
his
arms
round
me
then
the
merry
couple
turn
my
bed
into
a
playground
where
mother
lies
at
their
mercy
the
pulls
my
hair
and
would
take
to
sucking
again
while
armand
stands
guard
over
my
breast
as
though
defending
his
property
their
funny
ways
their
peals
of
laughter
are
too
much
for
me
and
put
sleep
fairly
to
flight
then
we
play
the
ogress
game
mother
ogress
eats
up
the
white
soft
flesh
with
hugs
and
rains
kisses
on
those
rosy
shoulders
and
eyes
brimming
over
with
saucy
mischief
we
have
little
jealous
tiffs
too
so
pretty
to
see
it
has
happened
to
me
dear
to
take
up
my
stockings
at
eight
and
be
still
at
nine
then
comes
the
getting
up
the
operation
of
dressing
begins
i
slip
on
my
turn
up
my
sleeves
and
don
the
mackintosh
apron
with
mary
assistance
i
wash
and
scrub
my
two
little
blossoms
i
am
sole
arbiter
of
the
temperature
of
the
bath
for
a
good
half
of
crying
and
whimpering
comes
from
mistakes
here
the
moment
has
arrived
for
paper
fleets
and
glass
ducks
since
the
only
way
to
get
children
thoroughly
washed
is
to
keep
them
well
amused
if
you
knew
the
diversions
that
have
to
be
invented
before
these
despotic
sovereigns
will
permit
a
soft
sponge
to
be
passed
over
every
nook
and
cranny
you
would
be
awestruck
at
the
amount
of
ingenuity
and
intelligence
demanded
by
the
maternal
profession
when
one
takes
it
seriously
prayers
scoldings
promises
are
alike
in
requisition
above
all
the
jugglery
must
be
so
dexterous
that
it
defies
detection
the
case
would
be
desperate
had
not
providence
to
the
cunning
of
the
child
matched
that
of
the
mother
a
child
is
a
diplomatist
only
to
be
mastered
like
the
diplomatists
of
the
great
world
through
his
passions
happily
it
takes
little
to
make
these
cherubs
laugh
the
fall
of
a
brush
a
piece
of
soap
slipping
from
the
hand
and
what
merry
shouts
and
if
our
triumphs
are
dearly
bought
still
triumphs
they
are
though
hidden
from
mortal
eye
even
the
father
knows
nothing
of
it
all
none
but
god
and
his
angels
and
perhaps
you
can
fathom
the
glances
of
satisfaction
which
mary
and
i
exchange
when
the
little
creatures
toilet
is
at
last
concluded
and
they
stand
spotless
and
shining
amid
a
chaos
of
soap
sponges
combs
basins
flannel
and
all
the
nameless
litter
of
a
true
english
nursery
for
i
am
so
far
a
convert
as
to
admit
that
english
women
have
a
talent
for
this
department
true
they
look
upon
the
child
only
from
the
point
of
view
of
material
but
where
this
is
concerned
their
arrangements
are
admirable
my
children
must
always
be
and
wear
woollen
socks
there
shall
be
no
swaddling
nor
bandages
on
the
other
hand
they
shall
never
be
left
alone
the
helplessness
of
the
french
infant
in
its
means
the
liberty
of
the
nurse
that
is
the
whole
explanation
a
mother
who
is
really
a
mother
is
never
free
there
is
my
answer
to
your
question
why
i
do
not
write
besides
the
management
of
the
estate
i
have
the
upbringing
of
two
children
on
my
hands
the
art
of
motherhood
involves
much
silent
unobtrusive
an
hourly
devotion
which
finds
no
detail
too
minute
the
soup
warming
before
the
fire
must
be
watched
am
i
the
kind
of
woman
do
you
suppose
to
shirk
such
cares
the
humblest
task
may
earn
a
rich
harvest
of
affection
how
pretty
is
a
child
laugh
when
he
finds
the
food
to
his
liking
armand
has
a
way
of
nodding
his
head
when
he
is
pleased
that
is
worth
a
lifetime
of
adoration
how
could
i
leave
to
any
one
else
the
privilege
and
delight
as
well
as
the
responsibility
of
blowing
on
the
spoonful
of
soup
which
is
too
hot
for
my
little
nais
my
nursling
of
seven
months
ago
who
still
remembers
my
breast
when
a
nurse
has
allowed
a
child
to
burn
its
tongue
and
lips
with
scalding
food
she
tells
the
mother
who
hurries
up
to
see
what
is
wrong
that
the
child
cried
from
hunger
how
could
a
mother
sleep
in
peace
with
the
thought
that
a
breath
less
pure
than
her
own
has
cooled
her
child
food
the
mother
whom
nature
has
made
the
direct
vehicle
of
food
to
infant
lips
to
mince
a
chop
for
nais
who
has
just
cut
her
last
teeth
and
mix
the
meat
cooked
to
a
turn
with
potatoes
is
a
work
of
patience
and
there
are
times
indeed
when
none
but
a
mother
could
succeed
in
making
an
impatient
child
go
through
with
its
meal
no
number
of
servants
then
and
no
english
nurse
can
dispense
a
mother
from
taking
the
field
in
person
in
that
daily
contest
where
gentleness
alone
should
grapple
with
the
little
griefs
and
pains
of
childhood
louise
the
care
of
these
innocent
darlings
is
a
work
to
engage
the
whole
soul
to
whose
hand
and
eyes
but
one
own
intrust
the
task
of
feeding
dressing
and
putting
to
bed
broadly
speaking
a
crying
child
is
the
unanswerable
condemnation
of
mother
or
nurse
except
when
the
cry
is
the
outcome
of
natural
pain
now
that
i
have
two
to
look
after
and
a
third
on
the
road
they
occupy
all
my
thoughts
even
you
whom
i
love
so
dearly
have
become
a
memory
to
me
my
own
dressing
is
not
always
completed
by
two
i
have
no
faith
in
mothers
whose
rooms
are
in
order
and
who
themselves
might
have
stepped
out
of
a
bandbox
yesterday
was
one
of
those
lovely
days
of
early
april
and
i
wanted
to
take
my
children
for
a
walk
while
i
was
still
able
for
the
warning
bell
is
in
my
ears
such
an
expedition
is
quite
an
epic
to
a
mother
one
dreams
of
it
the
night
before
armand
was
for
the
first
time
to
put
on
a
little
black
velvet
jacket
a
new
collar
which
i
had
worked
a
scotch
cap
with
the
stuart
colors
and
feathers
nais
was
to
be
in
white
and
pink
with
one
of
those
delicious
little
baby
caps
for
she
is
a
baby
still
though
she
will
lose
that
pretty
title
on
the
arrival
of
the
impatient
youngster
whom
i
call
my
beggar
for
he
will
have
the
portion
of
a
younger
son
you
see
louise
the
child
has
already
appeared
to
me
in
a
vision
so
i
know
it
is
a
boy
well
caps
collars
jackets
socks
dainty
little
shoes
pink
garters
the
muslin
frock
with
silk
embroidery
all
was
laid
out
on
my
bed
then
the
little
brown
heads
had
to
be
brushed
twittering
merrily
all
the
time
like
birds
answering
each
other
call
armand
hair
is
in
curls
while
nais
is
brought
forward
softly
on
the
forehead
as
a
border
to
the
cap
then
the
shoes
are
buckled
and
when
the
little
bare
legs
and
feet
have
trotted
off
to
the
nursery
while
two
shining
faces
mary
calls
them
and
eyes
ablaze
with
life
petition
me
to
start
my
heart
beats
fast
to
look
on
the
children
whom
one
own
hand
has
arrayed
the
pure
skin
brightly
veined
with
blue
that
one
has
bathed
laved
and
sponged
and
decked
with
gay
colors
of
silk
or
velvet
why
there
is
no
poem
comes
near
to
it
with
what
eager
covetous
longing
one
calls
them
back
for
one
more
kiss
on
those
white
necks
which
in
their
simple
collars
the
loveliest
woman
can
not
rival
even
the
coarsest
lithograph
of
such
a
scene
makes
a
mother
pause
and
i
feast
my
eyes
daily
on
the
living
picture
once
out
of
doors
triumphant
in
the
result
of
my
labors
while
i
was
admiring
the
princely
air
with
which
little
armand
helped
baby
to
totter
along
the
path
you
know
i
saw
a
carriage
coming
and
tried
to
get
them
out
of
the
way
the
children
tumbled
into
a
dirty
puddle
and
lo
my
works
of
art
are
ruined
we
had
to
take
them
back
and
change
their
things
i
took
the
little
one
in
my
arms
never
thinking
of
my
own
dress
which
was
ruined
while
mary
seized
armand
and
the
cavalcade
with
a
crying
baby
and
a
soaked
child
what
mind
has
a
mother
left
for
herself
dinner
time
arrives
and
as
a
rule
i
have
done
nothing
now
comes
the
problem
which
faces
me
twice
every
day
how
to
suffice
in
my
own
person
for
two
children
put
on
their
bibs
turn
up
their
sleeves
and
get
them
to
eat
in
the
midst
of
these
cares
joys
and
catastrophes
the
only
person
neglected
in
the
house
is
myself
if
the
children
have
been
naughty
often
i
do
get
rid
of
my
all
day
their
tempers
rule
my
toilet
as
the
price
of
a
few
minutes
in
which
i
write
you
these
pages
i
have
had
to
let
them
cut
pictures
out
of
my
novels
build
castles
with
books
chessmen
or
counters
and
give
nais
my
silks
and
wools
to
arrange
in
her
own
fashion
which
i
assure
you
is
so
complicated
that
she
is
entirely
absorbed
in
it
and
has
not
uttered
a
word
yet
i
have
nothing
to
complain
of
my
children
are
both
strong
and
independent
they
amuse
themselves
more
easily
then
you
would
think
they
find
delight
in
everything
a
guarded
liberty
is
worth
many
toys
a
few
pebbles
pink
yellow
purple
and
black
small
shells
the
mysteries
of
sand
are
a
world
of
pleasure
to
them
their
wealth
consists
in
possessing
a
multitude
of
small
things
i
watch
armand
and
find
him
talking
to
the
flowers
the
flies
the
chickens
and
imitating
them
he
is
on
friendly
terms
with
insects
and
never
wearies
of
admiring
them
everything
which
is
on
a
minute
scale
interests
them
armand
is
beginning
to
ask
the
why
of
everything
he
sees
he
has
come
to
ask
what
i
am
saying
to
his
godmother
whom
he
looks
on
as
a
fairy
strange
how
children
hit
the
mark
alas
my
sweet
i
would
not
sadden
you
with
the
tale
of
my
joys
let
me
give
you
some
notion
of
your
godson
character
the
other
day
we
were
followed
by
a
poor
man
begging
beggars
soon
find
out
that
a
mother
with
her
child
at
her
side
ca
resist
them
armand
has
no
idea
what
hunger
is
and
money
is
a
sealed
book
to
him
but
i
have
just
bought
him
a
trumpet
which
had
long
been
the
object
of
his
desires
he
held
it
out
to
the
old
man
with
a
kingly
air
saying
here
take
this
what
joy
the
world
can
give
would
compare
with
such
a
moment
may
i
keep
it
said
the
poor
man
to
me
i
too
madame
have
had
children
he
added
hardly
noticing
the
money
i
put
into
his
hand
i
shudder
when
i
think
that
armand
must
go
to
school
and
that
i
have
only
three
years
and
a
half
more
to
keep
him
by
me
the
flowers
that
blossom
in
his
sunny
childhood
will
fall
before
the
scythe
of
a
public
school
system
his
gracious
ways
and
bewitching
candor
will
lose
their
spontaneity
they
will
cut
the
curls
that
i
have
brushed
and
smoothed
and
kissed
so
often
what
will
they
do
with
the
thinking
being
that
is
armand
and
what
of
you
you
tell
me
nothing
of
your
life
are
you
still
in
love
with
felipe
for
as
regards
the
saracen
i
have
no
uneasiness
nais
has
just
had
a
tumble
and
if
i
run
on
like
this
my
letter
will
become
a
volume
xlvi
mme
de
macumer
to
the
comtesse
de
my
sweet
tender
renee
you
will
have
learned
from
the
papers
the
terrible
calamity
which
has
overwhelmed
me
i
have
not
been
able
to
write
you
even
a
word
for
twenty
days
i
never
left
his
bedside
i
received
his
last
breath
and
closed
his
eyes
i
kept
holy
watch
over
him
with
the
priests
and
repeated
the
prayers
for
the
dead
the
cruel
pangs
i
suffered
were
accepted
by
me
as
a
rightful
punishment
and
yet
when
i
saw
on
his
calm
lips
the
smile
which
was
his
last
farewell
to
me
how
was
it
possible
to
believe
that
i
had
caused
his
death
be
it
so
or
not
he
is
gone
and
i
am
left
to
you
who
have
known
us
both
so
well
what
more
need
i
say
these
words
contain
all
oh
i
would
give
my
share
of
heaven
to
hear
the
flattering
tale
that
my
prayers
have
power
to
bring
him
back
to
life
to
see
him
again
to
have
him
once
more
mine
were
it
only
for
a
second
would
mean
that
i
could
draw
breath
again
without
mortal
agony
will
you
not
come
soon
and
soothe
me
with
such
promises
is
not
your
love
strong
enough
to
deceive
me
but
stay
it
was
you
who
told
me
beforehand
that
he
would
suffer
through
me
was
it
so
indeed
yes
it
is
true
i
had
no
right
to
his
love
like
a
thief
i
took
what
was
not
mine
and
my
frenzied
grasp
has
crushed
the
life
out
of
my
bliss
the
madness
is
over
now
but
i
feel
that
i
am
alone
merciful
god
what
torture
of
the
damned
can
exceed
the
misery
in
that
word
when
they
took
him
away
from
me
i
lay
down
on
the
same
bed
and
hoped
to
die
there
was
but
a
door
between
us
and
it
seemed
to
me
i
had
strength
to
force
it
but
alas
i
was
too
young
for
death
and
after
forty
days
during
which
with
cruel
care
and
all
the
sorry
inventions
of
medical
science
they
slowly
nursed
me
back
to
life
i
find
myself
in
the
country
seated
by
my
window
surrounded
with
lovely
flowers
which
he
made
to
bloom
for
me
gazing
on
the
same
splendid
view
over
which
his
eyes
have
so
often
wandered
and
which
he
was
so
proud
to
have
discovered
since
it
gave
me
pleasure
ah
dear
renee
no
words
can
tell
how
new
surroundings
hurt
when
the
heart
is
dead
i
shiver
at
the
sight
of
the
moist
earth
in
my
garden
for
the
earth
is
a
vast
tomb
and
it
is
almost
as
though
i
walked
on
when
i
first
went
out
i
trembled
with
fear
and
could
not
move
it
was
so
sad
to
see
his
flowers
and
he
not
there
my
father
and
mother
are
in
spain
you
know
what
my
brothers
are
and
you
yourself
are
detained
in
the
country
but
you
need
not
be
uneasy
about
me
two
angels
of
mercy
flew
to
my
side
the
duc
and
the
duchesse
de
soria
hastened
to
their
brother
in
his
illness
and
have
been
everything
that
heart
could
wish
the
last
few
nights
before
the
end
found
the
three
of
us
gathered
in
calm
and
wordless
grief
round
the
bed
where
this
great
man
was
breathing
his
last
a
man
among
a
thousand
rare
in
any
age
head
and
shoulders
above
the
rest
of
us
in
everything
the
patient
resignation
of
my
felipe
was
angelic
the
sight
of
his
brother
and
marie
gave
him
a
moment
pleasure
and
easing
of
his
pain
darling
he
said
to
me
with
the
simple
frankness
which
never
deserted
him
i
had
almost
gone
from
life
without
leaving
to
fernand
the
barony
of
macumer
i
must
make
a
new
will
my
brother
will
forgive
me
he
knows
what
it
is
to
love
i
owe
my
life
to
the
care
of
my
and
his
wife
they
want
to
carry
me
off
to
spain
ah
renee
to
no
one
but
you
can
i
speak
freely
of
my
grief
a
sense
of
my
own
faults
weighs
me
to
the
ground
and
there
is
a
bitter
solace
in
pouring
them
out
to
you
poor
unheeded
cassandra
the
exactions
the
preposterous
jealousy
the
nagging
unrest
of
my
passion
wore
him
to
death
my
love
was
the
more
fraught
with
danger
for
him
because
we
had
both
the
same
exquisitely
sensitive
nature
we
spoke
the
same
language
nothing
was
lost
on
him
and
often
the
mocking
shaft
so
carelessly
discharged
went
straight
to
his
heart
you
can
have
no
idea
of
the
point
to
which
he
carried
submissiveness
i
had
only
to
tell
him
to
go
and
leave
me
alone
and
the
caprice
however
wounding
to
him
would
be
obeyed
without
a
murmur
his
last
breath
was
spent
in
blessing
me
and
in
repeating
that
a
single
morning
alone
with
me
was
more
precious
to
him
than
a
lifetime
spent
with
another
woman
were
she
even
the
marie
of
his
youth
my
tears
fall
as
i
write
the
words
this
is
the
manner
of
my
life
now
i
rise
at
midday
and
go
to
bed
at
seven
i
linger
absurdly
long
over
meals
i
saunter
about
slowly
standing
motionless
an
hour
at
a
time
before
a
single
plant
i
gaze
into
the
leafy
trees
i
take
a
sober
and
serious
interest
in
mere
nothings
i
long
for
shade
silence
and
night
in
a
word
i
fight
through
each
hour
as
it
comes
and
take
a
gloomy
pleasure
in
adding
it
to
the
heap
of
the
vanquished
my
peaceful
park
gives
me
all
the
company
i
care
for
everything
there
is
full
of
glorious
images
of
my
vanished
joy
invisible
for
others
but
eloquent
to
me
i
can
not
away
with
you
spaniards
i
exclaimed
one
morning
as
my
flung
herself
on
my
neck
you
have
some
nobility
that
we
lack
ah
renee
if
i
still
live
it
is
doubtless
because
heaven
tempers
the
sense
of
affliction
to
the
strength
of
those
who
have
to
bear
it
only
a
woman
can
know
what
it
is
to
lose
a
love
which
sprang
from
the
heart
and
was
genuine
throughout
a
passion
which
was
not
ephemeral
and
satisfied
at
once
the
spirit
and
the
flesh
how
rare
it
is
to
find
a
man
so
gifted
that
to
worship
him
brings
no
sense
of
degradation
if
such
supreme
fortune
befall
us
once
we
can
not
hope
for
it
a
second
time
men
of
true
greatness
whose
strength
and
worth
are
veiled
by
poetic
grace
and
who
charm
by
some
high
spiritual
power
men
made
to
be
adored
beware
of
love
love
will
ruin
you
and
ruin
the
woman
of
your
heart
this
is
the
burden
of
my
cry
as
i
pace
my
woodland
walks
and
he
has
left
me
no
child
that
love
so
rich
in
smiles
which
rained
perpetual
flowers
and
joy
has
left
no
fruit
i
am
a
thing
accursed
can
it
be
that
even
as
the
two
extremes
of
polar
ice
and
torrid
sand
are
alike
intolerant
of
life
so
the
very
purity
and
vehemence
of
a
passion
render
it
barren
as
hate
is
it
only
a
marriage
of
reason
such
as
yours
which
is
blessed
with
a
family
can
heaven
be
jealous
of
our
passions
there
are
wild
words
you
are
i
believe
the
one
person
whose
company
i
could
endure
come
to
me
then
none
but
renee
should
be
with
louise
in
her
sombre
garb
what
a
day
when
i
first
put
on
my
widow
bonnet
when
i
saw
myself
all
arrayed
in
black
i
fell
back
on
a
seat
and
wept
till
night
came
and
i
weep
again
as
i
recall
that
moment
of
anguish
writing
tires
me
thoughts
crowd
fast
but
i
have
no
heart
to
put
them
into
words
bring
your
children
you
can
nurse
baby
here
without
making
me
jealous
all
that
is
gone
is
not
here
and
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
see
my
godson
felipe
used
to
wish
for
a
child
like
little
armand
come
then
come
and
help
me
to
bear
my
woe

louise

darling
when
you
hold
this
letter
in
your
hands

shall
be
already
near
for
i
am
starting
a
few
minutes
after
it
we
shall
be
alone
together
louis
is
obliged
to
remain
in
provence
because
of
the
approaching
elections
he
wants
to
be
elected
again
and
the
liberals
are
already
plotting
against
his
return
i
do
come
to
comfort
you
i
only
bring
you
my
heart
to
beat
in
sympathy
with
yours
and
help
you
to
bear
with
life
i
come
to
bid
you
weep
for
only
with
tears
can
you
purchase
the
joy
of
meeting
him
again
remember
he
is
traveling
towards
heaven
and
every
step
forward
which
you
take
brings
you
nearer
to
him
every
duty
done
breaks
a
link
in
the
chain
that
keeps
you
apart
louise
in
my
arms
you
will
once
more
raise
your
head
and
go
on
your
way
to
him
pure
noble
washed
of
all
those
errors
which
had
no
root
in
your
heart
and
bearing
with
you
the
harvest
of
good
deeds
which
in
his
name
you
will
accomplish
here
i
scribble
these
hasty
lines
in
all
the
bustle
of
preparation
and
interrupted
by
the
babies
and
by
armand
who
keeps
saying
godmother
godmother
i
want
to
see
her
till
i
am
almost
jealous
he
might
be
your
child
second
part
xlviii
the
baronne
de
macumer
to
the
comtesse
de
october
yes
renee
it
is
quite
true
you
have
been
correctly
informed
i
have
sold
my
house
i
have
sold
chantepleurs
and
the
farms
in
but
no
more
please
i
am
neither
mad
nor
ruined
i
assure
you
let
us
go
into
the
matter
when
everything
was
wound
up
there
remained
to
me
of
my
poor
macumer
fortune
about
twelve
hundred
thousand
francs
i
will
account
as
to
a
practical
sister
for
every
penny
of
this
i
put
a
million
in
the
three
per
cents
when
they
were
at
fifty
and
so
i
have
got
an
income
for
myself
of
sixty
thousand
francs
instead
of
the
thirty
thousand
which
the
property
yielded
then
only
think
what
my
life
was
six
months
of
the
year
in
the
country
renewing
leases
listening
to
the
grumbles
of
the
farmers
who
pay
when
it
pleases
them
and
getting
as
bored
as
a
sportsman
in
wet
weather
there
was
produce
to
sell
and
i
always
sold
it
at
a
loss
then
in
paris
my
house
represented
a
rental
of
ten
thousand
francs
i
had
to
invest
my
money
at
the
notaries
i
was
kept
waiting
for
the
interest
and
could
only
get
the
money
back
by
prosecuting
in
addition
i
had
to
study
the
law
of
mortgage
in
short
there
was
business
in
nivernais
in
in
paris
and
what
a
burden
what
a
nuisance
what
a
vexing
and
losing
game
for
a
widow
of
whereas
now
my
fortune
is
secured
on
the
budget
in
place
of
paying
taxes
to
the
state
i
receive
from
it
every
in
my
own
person
and
free
from
cost
thirty
thousand
francs
in
thirty
notes
handed
over
the
counter
to
me
by
a
dapper
little
clerk
at
the
treasury
who
smiles
when
he
sees
me
coming
supposing
the
nation
went
bankrupt
well
to
begin
with
is
not
mine
to
see
trouble
so
far
from
my
door
at
the
worst
too
the
nation
would
not
dock
me
of
more
than
half
my
income
so
i
should
still
be
as
well
off
as
before
my
investment
and
in
the
meantime
i
shall
be
drawing
a
double
income
until
the
catastrophe
arrives
a
nation
does
become
bankrupt
more
than
once
in
a
century
so
i
shall
have
plenty
of
time
to
amass
a
little
capital
out
of
my
savings
and
finally
is
not
the
comte
de
a
peer
of
this
july
is
he
not
one
of
those
pillars
of
royalty
offered
by
the
people
to
the
king
of
the
french
how
can
i
have
qualms
with
a
friend
at
court
a
great
financier
head
of
the
audit
department
i
defy
you
to
arraign
my
sanity
i
am
almost
as
good
at
sums
as
your
citizen
king
do
you
know
what
inspires
a
woman
with
all
this
arithmetic
love
my
dear
alas
the
moment
has
come
for
unfolding
to
you
the
mysteries
of
my
conduct
the
motives
of
which
have
baffled
even
your
keen
sight
your
prying
affection
and
your
subtlety
i
am
to
be
married
in
a
country
village
near
paris
i
love
and
am
loved
i
love
as
much
as
a
woman
can
who
knows
love
well
i
am
loved
as
much
as
a
woman
ought
to
be
by
the
man
she
adores
forgive
me
renee
for
keeping
this
a
secret
from
you
and
from
every
one
if
your
friend
evades
all
spies
and
puts
curiosity
on
a
false
track
you
must
admit
that
my
feeling
for
poor
macumer
justified
some
dissimulation
besides
de
and
you
would
have
deafened
me
with
remonstrances
and
plagued
me
to
death
with
your
misgivings
to
which
the
facts
might
have
lent
some
color
you
know
if
no
one
else
does
to
what
pitch
my
jealousy
can
go
and
all
this
would
only
have
been
useless
torture
to
me
i
was
determined
to
carry
out
on
my
own
responsibility
what
you
renee
will
call
my
insane
project
and
i
would
take
counsel
only
with
my
own
head
and
heart
for
all
the
world
like
a
schoolgirl
giving
the
slip
to
her
watchful
parents
the
man
i
love
possesses
nothing
but
thirty
thousand
francs
worth
of
debts
which
i
have
paid
what
a
theme
for
comment
here
you
would
have
tried
to
make
gaston
out
an
adventurer
your
husband
would
have
set
detectives
on
the
dear
boy
i
preferred
to
sift
him
for
myself
he
has
been
wooing
me
now
close
on
two
years
i
am
he
is
the
difference
i
admit
is
huge
when
it
is
on
the
wrong
side
another
source
of
lamentation
lastly
he
is
a
poet
and
has
lived
by
his
trade
that
is
to
say
on
next
to
nothing
as
you
will
readily
understand
being
a
poet
he
has
spent
more
time
weaving
and
basking
in
the
sun
than
scribing
in
his
dingy
garret
now
practical
people
have
a
way
of
tarring
with
the
same
brush
of
inconstancy
authors
artists
and
in
general
all
men
who
live
by
their
brains
their
nimble
and
fertile
wit
lays
them
open
to
the
charge
of
a
like
agility
in
matters
of
the
heart
spite
of
the
debts
spite
of
the
difference
in
age
spite
of
the
poetry
an
end
is
to
be
placed
in
a
few
days
to
a
heroic
resistance
of
more
than
nine
months
during
which
he
has
not
been
allowed
even
to
kiss
my
hand
and
so
also
ends
the
season
of
our
sweet
pure
this
is
not
the
mere
surrender
of
a
raw
ignorant
and
curious
girl
as
it
was
eight
years
ago
the
gift
is
deliberate
and
my
lover
awaits
it
with
such
loyal
patience
that
if
i
pleased
i
could
postpone
the
marriage
for
a
year
there
is
no
servility
in
this
love
slave
he
may
be
but
the
heart
is
not
slavish
never
have
i
seen
a
man
of
nobler
feeling
or
one
whose
tenderness
was
more
rich
in
fancy
whose
love
bore
more
the
impress
of
his
soul
alas
my
sweet
one
the
art
of
love
is
his
by
heritage
a
few
words
will
tell
his
story
my
friend
has
no
other
name
than
marie
gaston
he
is
the
illegitimate
son
of
the
beautiful
lady
brandon
whose
fame
must
have
reached
you
and
who
died
a
victim
to
the
vengeance
of
lady
dudley
a
ghastly
story
of
which
the
dear
boy
knows
nothing
marie
gaston
was
placed
by
his
brother
louis
in
a
at
tours
where
he
remained
till
louis
after
settling
his
brother
at
school
sailed
a
few
days
later
for
foreign
parts
to
seek
his
fortune
to
use
the
words
of
an
old
woman
who
had
played
the
part
of
providence
to
him
this
brother
turned
sailor
used
to
write
him
at
long
intervals
letters
quite
fatherly
in
tone
and
breathing
a
noble
spirit
but
a
struggling
life
never
allowed
him
to
return
home
his
last
letter
told
marie
that
he
had
been
appointed
captain
in
the
navy
of
some
american
republic
and
exhorted
him
to
hope
for
better
days
alas
since
then
three
years
have
passed
and
my
poor
poet
has
never
heard
again
so
dearly
did
he
love
his
brother
that
he
would
have
started
to
look
for
him
but
for
daniel
the
author
who
took
a
generous
interest
in
marie
gaston
and
prevented
him
carrying
out
his
mad
impulse
nor
was
this
all
often
would
he
give
him
a
crust
and
a
corner
as
the
poet
puts
it
in
his
graphic
words
for
in
truth
the
poor
lad
was
in
terrible
straits
he
was
actually
innocent
enough
to
believe
incredible
as
it
seems
that
genius
was
the
shortest
road
to
fortune
and
from
to
his
one
aim
has
been
to
make
a
name
for
himself
in
letters
naturally
his
life
was
a
frightful
tissue
of
toil
and
hardships
alternating
between
hope
and
despair
the
good
advice
of
could
not
prevail
against
the
allurements
of
ambition
and
his
debts
went
on
growing
like
a
snowball
still
he
was
beginning
to
come
into
notice
when
i
happened
to
meet
him
at
mme
at
first
sight
he
inspired
me
unconsciously
to
himself
with
the
most
vivid
sympathy
how
did
it
come
about
that
this
virgin
heart
has
been
left
for
me
the
fact
is
that
my
poet
combines
genius
and
cleverness
passion
and
pride
and
women
are
always
afraid
of
greatness
which
has
no
weak
side
to
it
how
many
victories
were
needed
before
josephine
could
see
the
great
napoleon
in
the
little
bonaparte
whom
she
had
married
poor
gaston
is
innocent
enough
to
think
he
knows
the
measure
of
my
love
he
simply
has
not
an
idea
of
it
but
to
you
i
must
make
it
clear
for
this
letter
renee
is
something
in
the
nature
of
a
last
will
and
testament
weigh
well
what
i
am
going
to
say
i
beg
of
you
at
this
moment
i
am
confident
of
being
loved
as
perhaps
not
another
women
on
this
earth
nor
have
i
a
shadow
of
doubt
as
to
the
perfect
happiness
of
our
wedded
life
to
which
i
bring
a
feeling
hitherto
unknown
to
me
yes
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
know
the
delight
of
being
swayed
by
passion
that
which
every
woman
seeks
in
love
will
be
mine
in
marriage
as
poor
felipe
once
adored
me
so
do
i
now
adore
gaston
i
have
lost
control
of
myself
i
tremble
before
this
boy
as
the
arab
hero
used
to
tremble
before
me
in
a
word
the
balance
of
love
is
now
on
my
side
and
this
makes
me
timid
i
am
full
of
the
most
absurd
terrors
i
am
afraid
of
being
deserted
afraid
of
becoming
old
and
ugly
while
gaston
still
retains
his
youth
and
beauty
afraid
of
coming
short
of
his
hopes
and
yet
i
believe
i
have
it
in
me
i
believe
i
have
sufficient
devotion
and
ability
not
only
to
keep
alive
the
flame
of
his
love
in
our
solitary
life
far
from
the
world
but
even
to
make
it
burn
stronger
and
brighter
if
i
am
mistaken
if
this
splendid
idyl
of
love
in
hiding
must
come
to
an
end
an
end
what
am
i
saying
if
i
find
gaston
love
less
intense
any
day
than
it
was
the
evening
before
be
sure
of
this
renee
i
should
visit
my
failure
only
on
myself
no
blame
should
attach
to
him
i
tell
you
now
it
would
mean
my
death
not
even
if
i
had
children
could
i
live
on
these
terms
for
i
know
myself
renee
i
know
that
my
nature
is
the
lover
rather
than
the
mother
therefore
before
taking
this
vow
upon
my
soul
i
implore
you
my
renee
if
this
disaster
befall
me
to
take
the
place
of
mother
to
my
children
let
them
be
my
legacy
to
you
all
that
i
know
of
you
your
blind
attachment
to
duty
your
rare
gifts
your
love
of
children
your
affection
for
me
would
help
to
make
my
death
i
dare
not
say
easy
but
at
least
less
bitter
the
compact
i
have
thus
made
with
myself
adds
a
vague
terror
to
the
solemnity
of
my
marriage
ceremony
for
this
reason
i
wish
to
have
no
one
whom
i
know
present
and
it
will
be
performed
in
secret
let
my
heart
fail
me
if
it
will
at
least
i
shall
not
read
anxiety
in
your
dear
eyes
and
i
alone
shall
know
that
this
new
which
i
sign
may
be
my
death
warrant
i
shall
not
refer
again
to
this
agreement
entered
into
between
my
present
self
and
the
self
i
am
to
be
i
have
confided
it
to
you
in
order
that
you
might
know
the
full
extent
of
your
responsibilities
in
marrying
i
retain
full
control
of
my
property
and
gaston
while
aware
that
i
have
enough
to
secure
a
comfortable
life
for
both
of
us
is
ignorant
of
its
amount
within
hours
i
shall
dispose
of
it
as
i
please
and
in
order
to
save
him
from
a
humiliating
position
i
shall
have
stock
bringing
in
twelve
thousand
francs
a
year
assigned
to
him
he
will
find
this
in
his
desk
on
the
eve
of
our
wedding
if
he
declined
to
accept
i
should
break
off
the
whole
thing
i
had
to
threaten
a
rupture
to
get
his
permission
to
pay
his
debts
this
long
confession
has
tired
me
i
shall
finish
it
the
day
after
i
have
to
spend
in
the
country
october
i
will
tell
you
now
the
steps
i
have
taken
to
insure
secrecy
my
object
has
been
to
ward
off
every
possible
incitement
to
my
jealousy
in
imitation
of
the
italian
princess
who
like
a
lioness
rushing
on
her
prey
carried
it
off
to
some
swiss
town
to
devour
in
peace
and
i
confide
my
plans
to
you
because
i
have
another
favor
to
beg
namely
that
you
will
respect
our
solitude
and
never
come
to
see
us
uninvited
two
years
ago
i
purchased
a
small
property
overlooking
the
ponds
of
ville
on
the
road
to
versailles
it
consists
of
twenty
acres
of
meadow
land
the
skirts
of
a
wood
and
a
fine
fruit
garden
below
the
meadows
the
land
has
been
excavated
so
as
to
make
a
lakelet
of
about
three
acres
in
extent
with
a
charming
little
island
in
the
middle
the
small
valley
is
shut
in
by
two
graceful
slopes
where
rise
delicious
springs
that
water
my
park
by
means
of
channels
cleverly
disposed
by
my
architect
finally
they
fall
into
the
royal
ponds
glimpses
of
which
can
be
seen
here
and
there
gleaming
in
the
distance
my
little
park
has
been
admirably
laid
out
by
the
architect
who
has
surrounded
it
by
hedges
walls
or
according
to
the
lie
of
the
land
so
that
no
possible
point
of
view
may
be
lost
a
chalet
has
been
built
for
me
up
the
hillside
with
a
charming
exposure
having
the
woods
of
the
ronce
on
either
side
and
in
front
a
grassy
slope
running
down
to
the
lake
externally
the
chalet
is
an
exact
copy
of
those
which
are
so
much
admired
by
travelers
on
the
road
from
sion
to
brieg
and
which
fascinated
me
when
i
was
returning
from
italy
the
internal
decorations
will
bear
comparison
with
those
of
the
most
celebrated
buildings
of
the
kind
a
hundred
paces
from
this
rustic
dwelling
stands
a
charming
and
ornamental
house
communicating
with
it
by
a
subterranean
passage
this
contains
the
kitchen
and
other
servants
rooms
stables
and
of
all
this
series
of
brick
buildings
the
facade
alone
is
seen
graceful
in
its
simplicity
against
a
background
of
shrubbery
another
building
serves
to
lodge
the
gardeners
and
masks
the
entrance
to
the
orchards
and
the
entrance
gate
to
the
property
is
so
hidden
in
the
wall
dividing
the
park
from
the
wood
as
almost
to
defy
detection
the
plantations
already
well
grown
will
in
two
or
three
years
completely
hide
the
buildings
so
that
except
in
winter
when
the
trees
are
bare
no
trace
of
habitation
will
appear
to
the
outside
world
save
only
the
smoke
visible
from
the
neighboring
hills
the
surroundings
of
my
chalet
have
been
modeled
on
what
is
called
the
king
garden
at
versailles
but
it
has
an
outlook
on
my
lakelet
and
island
the
hills
on
every
side
display
their
abundant
foliage
those
splendid
trees
for
which
your
new
civil
list
has
so
well
cared
my
gardeners
have
orders
to
cultivate
new
flowers
to
any
extent
and
no
others
so
that
our
home
will
be
a
fragrant
emerald
the
chalet
adorned
with
a
wild
vine
which
covers
the
roof
is
literally
embedded
in
climbing
plants
of
all
kinds
hops
clematis
jasmine
azalea
copaea
it
will
be
a
sharp
eye
which
can
descry
our
windows
the
chalet
my
dear
is
a
good
solid
house
with
its
heating
system
and
all
the
conveniences
of
modern
architecture
which
can
raise
a
palace
in
the
compass
of
a
hundred
square
feet
it
contains
a
suite
of
rooms
for
gaston
and
another
for
me
the
is
occupied
by
an
a
parlor
and
a
dining
room
above
our
floor
again
are
three
rooms
destined
for
the
nurseries
i
have
five
horses
a
small
light
coupe
and
a
cabriolet
we
are
only
drive
from
paris
so
that
when
the
spirit
moves
us
to
hear
an
opera
or
see
a
new
play
we
can
start
after
dinner
and
return
the
same
night
to
our
bower
the
road
is
a
good
one
and
passes
under
the
shade
of
our
green
dividing
wall
my
servants
cook
coachman
groom
and
gardeners
in
addition
to
my
maid
are
all
very
respectable
people
whom
i
have
spent
the
last
six
months
in
picking
up
and
they
will
be
superintended
by
my
old
philippe
although
confident
of
their
loyalty
and
good
faith
i
have
not
neglected
to
cultivate
their
wages
are
small
but
will
receive
an
annual
addition
in
the
shape
of
a
new
year
day
present
they
are
all
aware
that
the
slightest
fault
or
a
mere
suspicion
of
gossiping
might
lose
them
a
capital
place
lovers
are
never
troublesome
to
their
servants
they
are
indulgent
by
disposition
and
therefore
i
feel
that
i
can
reckon
on
my
household
all
that
is
choice
pretty
or
decorative
in
my
house
in
the
rue
du
bac
has
been
transported
to
the
chalet
the
rembrandt
hangs
on
the
staircase
as
though
it
were
a
mere
daub
the
hobbema
faces
the
rubens
in
study
the
titian
which
my
mary
sent
me
from
madrid
adorns
the
boudoir
the
beautiful
furniture
picked
up
by
felipe
looks
very
well
in
the
parlor
which
the
architect
has
decorated
most
tastefully
everything
at
the
chalet
is
charmingly
simple
with
the
simplicity
which
ca
be
got
under
a
hundred
thousand
francs
our
rests
on
cellars
which
are
built
of
millstone
and
embedded
in
concrete
it
is
almost
completely
buried
in
flowers
and
shrubs
and
is
deliciously
cool
without
a
vestige
of
damp
to
complete
the
picture
a
fleet
of
white
swans
sail
over
my
lake
oh
renee
the
silence
which
reigns
in
this
valley
would
bring
joy
to
the
dead
one
is
awakened
by
the
birds
singing
or
the
breeze
rustling
in
the
poplars
a
little
spring
discovered
by
the
architect
in
digging
the
foundations
of
the
wall
trickles
down
the
hillside
over
silvery
sand
to
the
lake
between
two
banks
of
hugging
the
edge
of
the
woods
i
know
nothing
that
money
can
buy
to
equal
it
may
not
gaston
come
to
loathe
this
too
perfect
bliss
i
shudder
to
think
how
complete
it
is
for
the
ripest
fruits
harbor
the
worms
the
most
gorgeous
flowers
attract
the
insects
is
it
not
ever
the
monarch
of
the
forest
which
is
eaten
away
by
the
fatal
brown
grub
greedy
as
death
i
have
learned
before
now
that
an
unseen
and
jealous
power
attacks
happiness
which
has
reached
perfection
besides
this
is
the
moral
of
all
your
preaching
and
you
have
been
proved
a
prophet
when
i
went
the
day
before
yesterday
to
see
whether
my
last
whim
had
been
carried
out
tears
rose
to
my
eyes
and
to
the
great
surprise
of
my
architect
i
at
once
passed
his
account
for
payment
but
madame
he
exclaimed
your
man
of
business
will
refuse
to
pay
this
it
is
a
matter
of
three
hundred
thousand
francs
my
only
reply
was
to
add
the
words
to
be
paid
without
question
with
the
bearing
of
a
chaulieu
but
i
said
there
is
one
condition
to
my
gratitude
no
human
being
must
hear
from
you
of
the
park
and
buildings
promise
me
on
your
honor
to
observe
this
article
in
our
contract
not
to
breathe
to
a
soul
the
proprietor
name
now
can
you
understand
the
meaning
of
my
sudden
journeys
my
mysterious
comings
and
goings
now
do
you
know
whither
those
beautiful
things
which
the
world
supposes
to
be
sold
have
flown
do
you
perceive
the
ultimate
motive
of
my
change
of
investment
love
my
dear
is
a
vast
business
and
they
who
would
succeed
in
it
should
have
no
other
henceforth
i
shall
have
no
more
trouble
from
money
matters
i
have
taken
all
the
thorns
out
of
my
life
and
done
my
housekeeping
work
once
for
all
with
a
vengeance
so
as
never
to
be
troubled
with
it
again
except
during
the
daily
ten
minutes
which
i
shall
devote
to
my
old
philippe
i
have
made
a
study
of
life
and
its
sharp
curves
there
came
a
day
when
death
also
gave
me
harsh
lessons
now
i
want
to
turn
all
this
to
account
my
one
occupation
will
be
to
please
and
love
to
brighten
with
variety
what
to
common
mortals
is
monotonously
dull
gaston
is
still
in
complete
ignorance
at
my
request
he
has
like
myself
taken
up
his
quarters
at
ville
we
start
for
the
chalet
our
life
there
will
cost
but
little
but
if
i
told
you
the
sum
i
am
setting
aside
for
my
toilet
you
would
exclaim
at
my
madness
and
with
reason
i
intend
to
take
as
much
trouble
to
make
myself
beautiful
for
him
every
day
as
other
women
do
for
society
my
dress
in
the
country
year
in
year
out
will
cost
thousand
francs
and
the
larger
portion
of
this
will
not
go
in
day
costumes
as
for
him
he
can
wear
a
blouse
if
he
pleases
do
suppose
that
i
am
going
to
turn
our
life
into
an
amorous
duel
and
wear
myself
out
in
devices
for
feeding
passion
all
that
i
want
is
to
have
a
conscience
free
from
reproach
thirteen
years
still
lie
before
me
as
a
pretty
woman
and
i
am
determined
to
be
loved
on
the
last
day
of
the
thirteenth
even
more
fondly
than
on
the
morrow
of
our
mysterious
nuptials
this
time
no
cutting
words
shall
mar
my
lowly
grateful
content
i
will
take
the
part
of
servant
since
that
of
mistress
throve
so
ill
with
me
before
ah
renee
if
gaston
has
sounded
as
i
have
the
heights
and
depths
of
love
my
happiness
is
assured
nature
at
the
chalet
wears
her
fairest
face
the
woods
are
charming
each
step
opens
up
to
you
some
fresh
vista
of
cool
greenery
which
delights
the
soul
by
the
sweet
thoughts
it
wakens
they
breathe
of
love
if
only
this
be
not
the
gorgeous
theatre
dressed
by
my
hand
for
my
own
martyrdom
in
two
days
from
now
i
shall
be
mme
gaston
my
god
is
it
fitting
a
christian
so
to
love
mortal
man
well
at
least
you
have
the
law
with
you
was
the
comment
of
my
man
of
business
who
is
to
be
one
of
my
witnesses
and
who
exclaimed
on
discovering
why
my
property
was
to
be
realized
i
am
losing
a
client
and
you
my
sweetheart
whom
i
dare
no
longer
call
my
loved
one
may
you
not
cry
i
am
losing
a
sister
my
sweet
address
when
you
write
in
future
to
mme
gaston
poste
restante
versailles
we
shall
send
there
every
day
for
letters
i
want
to
be
known
to
the
country
people
and
we
shall
get
our
provisions
from
paris
in
this
way
i
hope
we
may
guard
the
secret
of
our
lives
nobody
has
been
seen
in
the
place
during
the
years
spent
in
preparing
our
retreat
and
the
purchase
was
made
in
the
troubled
period
which
followed
the
revolution
of
july
the
only
person
who
has
shown
himself
here
is
the
architect
he
alone
is
known
and
he
will
not
return
farewell
as
i
write
this
word
i
know
not
whether
my
heart
is
fuller
of
grief
or
joy
that
proves
does
it
not
that
the
pain
of
losing
you
equals
my
love
for
gaston
xlix
marie
gaston
to
daniel
october
my
dear
daniel
i
need
two
witnesses
for
my
marriage
i
beg
of
you
to
come
evening
for
this
purpose
bringing
with
you
our
worthy
and
honored
friend
joseph
bridau
she
who
is
to
be
my
wife
with
an
instinctive
divination
of
my
dearest
wishes
has
declared
her
intention
of
living
far
from
the
world
in
complete
retirement
you
who
have
done
so
much
to
lighten
my
penury
have
been
left
in
ignorance
of
my
love
but
you
will
understand
that
absolute
secrecy
was
essential
this
will
explain
to
you
why
it
is
that
for
the
last
year
we
have
seen
so
little
of
each
other
on
the
morrow
of
my
wedding
we
shall
be
parted
for
a
long
time
but
daniel
you
are
of
stuff
to
understand
me
friendship
can
subsist
in
the
absence
of
the
friend
there
may
be
times
when
i
shall
want
you
badly
but
i
shall
not
see
you
at
least
not
in
my
own
house
here
again
has
forestalled
our
wishes
she
has
sacrificed
to
me
her
intimacy
with
a
friend
of
her
childhood
who
has
been
a
sister
to
her
for
her
sake
then
i
also
must
relinquish
my
comrade
from
this
fact
alone
you
will
divine
that
ours
is
no
mere
passing
fancy
but
love
absolute
perfect
godlike
love
based
upon
the
fullest
knowledge
that
can
bind
two
hearts
in
sympathy
to
me
it
is
a
perpetual
spring
of
purest
delight
yet
nature
allows
of
no
happiness
without
alloy
and
deep
down
in
the
innermost
recess
of
my
heart
i
am
conscious
of
a
lurking
thought
not
shared
with
her
the
pang
of
which
is
for
me
alone
you
have
too
often
come
to
the
help
of
my
inveterate
poverty
to
be
ignorant
how
desperate
matters
were
with
me
where
should
i
have
found
courage
to
keep
up
the
struggle
of
life
after
seeing
my
hopes
so
often
blighted
but
for
your
cheering
words
your
tactful
aid
and
the
knowledge
of
what
you
had
come
through
briefly
then
my
friend
she
freed
me
from
that
crushing
load
of
debt
which
was
no
secret
to
you
she
is
wealthy
i
am
penniless
many
a
time
have
i
exclaimed
in
one
of
my
fits
of
idleness
oh
for
some
great
heiress
to
cast
her
eye
on
me
and
now
in
presence
of
this
reality
the
boy
careless
jest
the
unscrupulous
cynicism
of
the
outcast
have
alike
vanished
leaving
in
their
place
only
a
bitter
sense
of
humiliation
which
not
the
most
considerate
tenderness
on
her
part
nor
my
own
assurance
of
her
noble
nature
can
remove
nay
what
better
proof
of
my
love
could
there
exist
for
her
or
for
myself
than
this
shame
from
which
i
have
not
recoiled
even
when
powerless
to
overcome
it
the
fact
remains
that
there
is
a
point
where
far
from
protecting
i
am
the
protected
this
is
my
pain
which
i
confide
to
you
except
in
this
one
particular
dear
daniel
my
fondest
dreams
are
more
than
realized
fairest
and
noblest
among
women
such
a
bride
might
indeed
raise
a
man
to
giddy
heights
of
bliss
her
gentle
ways
are
seasoned
with
wit
her
love
comes
with
an
grace
and
charm
her
mind
is
well
informed
and
quick
to
understand
in
person
she
is
fair
and
lovely
with
a
rounded
slimness
as
though
raphael
and
rubens
had
conspired
to
create
a
woman
i
do
not
know
whether
i
could
have
worshiped
with
such
fervor
at
the
shrine
of
a
dark
beauty
a
brunette
always
strikes
me
as
an
unfinished
boy
she
is
a
widow
childless
and
years
of
age
though
brimful
of
life
and
energy
she
has
her
moods
also
of
dreamy
melancholy
these
rare
gifts
go
with
a
proud
aristocratic
bearing
she
has
a
fine
presence
she
belongs
to
one
of
those
old
families
who
make
a
fetich
of
rank
yet
loves
me
enough
to
ignore
the
misfortune
of
my
birth
our
secret
passion
is
now
of
long
standing
we
have
made
trial
each
of
the
other
and
find
that
in
the
matter
of
jealousy
we
are
twin
spirits
our
thoughts
are
the
reverberation
of
the
same
thunderclap
we
both
love
for
the
first
time
and
this
bewitching
springtime
has
filled
its
days
for
us
with
all
the
images
of
delight
that
fancy
can
paint
in
laughing
sweet
or
musing
mood
our
path
has
been
strewn
with
the
flowers
of
tender
imaginings
each
hour
brought
its
own
wealth
and
when
we
parted
it
was
to
put
our
thoughts
in
verse
not
for
a
moment
did
i
harbor
the
idea
of
sullying
the
brightness
of
such
a
time
by
giving
the
rein
to
sensual
passion
however
it
might
chafe
within
she
was
a
widow
and
free
intuitively
she
realized
all
the
homage
implied
in
this
constant
which
often
moved
her
to
tears
can
you
not
read
in
this
my
friend
a
soul
of
noble
temper
in
mutual
fear
we
shunned
even
the
first
kiss
of
love
we
have
each
a
wrong
to
reproach
ourselves
with
she
said
one
day
where
is
yours
i
asked
my
marriage
was
her
reply
daniel
you
are
a
giant
among
us
and
you
love
one
of
the
most
gifted
women
of
the
aristocracy
which
has
produced
my
armande
what
need
to
tell
you
more
such
an
answer
lays
bare
to
you
a
woman
heart
and
all
the
happiness
which
is
in
store
for
your
friend
marie
gaston
mme
de
to
mme
de
macumer
louise
can
it
be
that
with
all
your
knowledge
of
the
mischief
wrought
by
the
indulgence
of
passion
even
within
the
heart
of
marriage
you
are
planning
a
life
of
wedded
solitude
having
sacrificed
your
first
husband
in
the
course
of
a
fashionable
career
would
you
now
fly
to
the
desert
to
consume
a
second
what
stores
of
misery
you
are
laying
up
for
yourself
but
i
see
from
the
way
you
have
set
about
it
that
there
is
no
going
back
the
man
who
has
overcome
your
aversion
to
a
second
marriage
must
indeed
possess
some
magic
of
mind
and
heart
and
you
can
only
be
left
to
your
illusions
but
have
you
forgotten
your
former
criticism
on
young
men
not
one
you
would
say
but
has
visited
haunts
of
shame
and
has
besmirched
his
purity
with
the
filth
of
the
streets
where
is
the
change
pray
in
them
or
in
you
you
are
a
lucky
woman
to
be
able
to
believe
in
happiness
i
have
not
the
courage
to
blame
you
for
it
though
the
instinct
of
affection
urges
me
to
dissuade
you
from
this
marriage
yes
a
thousand
times
yes
it
is
true
that
nature
and
society
are
at
one
in
making
war
on
absolute
happiness
because
such
a
condition
is
opposed
to
the
laws
of
both
possibly
also
because
heaven
is
jealous
of
its
privileges
my
love
for
you
forebodes
some
disaster
to
which
all
my
penetration
can
give
no
definite
form
i
know
neither
whence
nor
from
whom
it
will
arise
but
one
need
be
no
prophet
to
foretell
that
the
mere
weight
of
a
boundless
happiness
will
overpower
you
excess
of
joy
is
harder
to
bear
than
any
amount
of
sorrow
against
him
i
have
not
a
word
to
say
you
love
him
and
in
all
probability
i
have
never
seen
him
but
some
idle
day
i
hope
you
will
send
me
a
sketch
however
slight
of
this
rare
fine
animal
if
you
see
me
so
resigned
and
cheerful
it
is
because
i
am
convinced
that
once
the
honeymoon
is
over
you
will
both
with
one
accord
fall
back
into
the
common
track
some
day
two
years
hence
when
we
are
walking
along
this
famous
road
you
will
exclaim
why
there
is
the
chalet
which
was
to
be
my
home
for
ever
and
you
will
laugh
your
dear
old
laugh
which
shows
all
your
pretty
teeth
i
have
said
nothing
yet
to
louis
it
would
be
too
good
an
opening
for
his
ridicule
i
shall
tell
him
simply
that
you
are
going
to
be
married
and
that
you
wish
it
kept
secret
unluckily
you
need
neither
mother
nor
sister
for
your
bridal
evening
we
are
in
october
now
like
a
brave
woman
you
are
grappling
with
winter
first
if
it
were
not
a
question
of
marriage
i
should
say
you
were
taking
the
bull
by
the
horns
in
any
case
you
will
have
in
me
the
most
discreet
and
intelligent
of
friends
that
mysterious
region
known
as
the
centre
of
africa
has
swallowed
up
many
travelers
and
you
seem
to
me
to
be
launching
on
an
expedition
which
in
the
domain
of
sentiment
corresponds
to
those
where
so
many
explorers
have
perished
whether
in
the
sands
or
at
the
hands
of
natives
your
desert
is
happily
only
two
leagues
from
paris
so
i
can
wish
you
quite
cheerfully
a
safe
journey
and
speedy
return
li
the
comtesse
de
to
mme
marie
gaston
what
has
come
to
you
my
dear
after
a
silence
of
two
years
surely
renee
has
a
right
to
feel
anxious
about
louise
so
this
is
love
it
brushes
aside
and
scatters
to
the
winds
a
friendship
such
as
ours
you
must
admit
that
devoted
as
i
am
to
my
children
more
even
perhaps
than
you
to
your
gaston
a
mother
love
has
something
expansive
about
it
which
does
not
allow
it
to
steal
from
other
affections
or
interfere
with
the
claims
of
friendship
i
miss
your
letters
i
long
for
a
sight
of
your
dear
sweet
face
oh
louise
my
heart
has
only
conjecture
to
feed
upon
as
regards
ourselves
i
will
try
and
tell
you
everything
as
briefly
as
possible
on
reading
your
last
letter
but
one
i
find
some
stinging
comments
on
our
political
situation
you
mocked
at
us
for
keeping
the
post
in
the
audit
department
which
as
well
as
the
title
of
count
louis
owed
to
the
favor
of
charles
x
but
i
should
like
to
know
please
how
it
would
be
possible
out
of
an
income
of
forty
thousand
livres
thirty
thousand
of
which
go
with
the
entail
to
give
a
suitable
start
in
life
to
athenais
and
my
poor
little
beggar
rene
was
it
not
a
duty
to
live
on
our
salary
and
prudently
allow
the
income
of
the
estate
to
accumulate
in
this
way
we
shall
in
twenty
years
have
put
together
about
six
hundred
thousand
francs
which
will
provide
portions
for
my
daughter
and
for
rene
whom
i
destine
for
the
navy
the
poor
little
chap
will
have
an
income
of
ten
thousand
livres
and
perhaps
we
may
contrive
to
leave
him
in
cash
enough
to
bring
his
portion
up
to
the
amount
of
his
sister
when
he
is
captain
my
beggar
will
be
able
to
make
a
wealthy
marriage
and
take
a
position
in
society
as
good
as
his
elder
brother
these
considerations
of
prudence
determined
the
acceptance
in
our
family
of
the
new
order
of
things
the
new
dynasty
as
was
natural
raised
louis
to
the
peerage
and
made
him
a
grand
officer
of
the
legion
of
honor
the
oath
once
taken
could
not
be
in
his
services
and
he
has
since
then
made
himself
very
useful
in
the
chamber
the
position
he
has
now
attained
is
one
in
which
he
can
rest
upon
his
oars
till
the
end
of
his
days
he
has
a
good
deal
of
adroitness
in
business
matters
and
though
he
can
hardly
be
called
an
orator
speaks
pleasantly
and
fluently
which
is
all
that
is
necessary
in
politics
his
shrewdness
and
the
extent
of
his
information
in
all
matters
of
government
and
administration
are
fully
appreciated
and
all
parties
consider
him
indispensable
i
may
tell
you
that
he
was
recently
offered
an
embassy
but
i
would
not
let
him
accept
it
i
am
tied
to
paris
by
the
education
of
armand
and
athenais
who
are
now
respectively
thirteen
and
nearly
eleven
and
i
do
intend
leaving
till
little
rene
has
completed
his
which
is
just
beginning
we
could
not
have
remained
faithful
to
the
elder
branch
of
the
dynasty
and
returned
to
our
country
life
without
allowing
the
education
and
prospects
of
the
three
children
to
suffer
a
mother
my
sweet
is
hardly
called
on
to
be
a
decius
especially
at
a
time
when
the
type
is
rare
in
fifteen
years
from
now
will
be
able
to
retire
to
la
crampade
on
a
good
pension
having
found
a
place
as
referendary
for
armand
in
the
audit
department
as
for
rene
the
navy
will
doubtless
make
a
diplomatist
of
him
the
little
rogue
at
seven
years
old
has
all
the
cunning
of
an
old
cardinal
oh
louise
i
am
indeed
a
happy
mother
my
children
are
an
endless
source
of
joy
to
me

armand
is
a
day
scholar
at
henry
iv
school
i
made
up
my
mind
he
should
have
a
training
yet
could
not
reconcile
myself
to
the
thought
of
parting
with
him
so
i
compromised
as
the
duc
did
before
he
became
or
in
order
that
he
might
become
louis
philippe
every
morning
lucas
the
old
servant
whom
you
will
remember
takes
armand
to
school
in
time
for
the
first
lesson
and
brings
him
home
again
at
four
in
the
house
we
have
a
private
tutor
an
admirable
scholar
who
helps
armand
with
his
work
in
the
evenings
and
calls
him
in
the
morning
at
the
school
hour
lucas
takes
him
some
lunch
during
the
play
hour
at
midday
in
this
way
i
am
with
my
boy
at
dinner
and
until
he
goes
to
bed
at
night
and
i
see
him
off
in
the
morning
armand
is
the
same
charming
little
fellow
full
of
feeling
and
unselfish
impulse
whom
you
loved
and
his
tutor
is
quite
pleased
with
him
i
still
have
nais
and
the
baby
two
restless
little
mortals
but
i
am
quite
as
much
a
child
as
they
are
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
lose
the
darlings
sweet
caresses
i
could
not
live
without
the
feeling
that
at
any
moment
i
can
fly
to
armand
bedside
and
watch
his
slumbers
or
snatch
a
kiss
yet
home
education
is
not
without
its
drawbacks
to
which
i
am
fully
alive
society
like
nature
is
a
jealous
power
and
will
have
not
her
rights
encroached
on
or
her
system
set
at
naught
thus
children
who
are
brought
up
at
home
are
exposed
too
early
to
the
fire
of
the
world
they
see
its
passions
and
become
at
home
with
its
subterfuges
the
finer
distinctions
which
regulate
the
conduct
of
matured
men
and
women
elude
their
perceptions
and
they
take
feeling
and
passion
for
their
guide
instead
of
subordinating
those
to
the
code
of
society
whilst
the
gay
trappings
and
tinsel
which
attract
so
much
of
the
world
favor
blind
them
to
the
importance
of
the
more
sober
virtues
a
child
of
fifteen
with
the
assurance
of
a
man
of
the
world
is
a
thing
against
all
nature
at
he
will
be
prematurely
old
and
his
precocious
knowledge
only
unfits
him
for
the
genuine
study
on
which
all
solid
ability
must
rest
life
in
society
is
one
long
comedy
and
those
who
take
part
in
it
like
other
actors
reflect
back
impressions
which
never
penetrate
below
the
surface
a
mother
therefore
who
wishes
not
to
part
from
her
children
must
resolutely
determine
that
they
shall
not
enter
the
gay
world
she
must
have
courage
to
resist
their
inclinations
as
well
as
her
own
and
keep
them
in
the
background
cornelia
had
to
keep
her
jewels
under
lock
and
key
shall
i
do
less
for
the
children
who
are
all
the
world
to
me
now
that
i
am
thirty
the
heat
of
the
day
is
over
the
hardest
bit
of
the
road
lies
behind
me
in
a
few
years
i
shall
be
an
old
woman
and
the
sense
of
duty
done
is
an
immense
encouragement
it
would
almost
seem
as
though
my
trio
can
read
my
thoughts
and
shape
themselves
accordingly
a
mysterious
bond
of
sympathy
unites
me
to
these
children
who
have
never
left
my
side
if
they
knew
the
blank
in
my
life
which
they
have
to
fill
they
could
not
be
more
lavish
of
the
solace
they
bring
armand
who
was
dull
and
dreamy
during
his
first
three
years
at
school
and
caused
me
some
uneasiness
has
made
a
sudden
start
doubtless
he
realized
in
a
way
most
children
never
do
the
aim
of
all
this
preparatory
work
which
is
to
sharpen
the
intelligence
to
get
them
into
habits
of
application
and
accustom
them
to
that
fundamental
principle
of
all
society
obedience
my
dear
a
few
days
ago
i
had
the
proud
joy
of
seeing
armand
crowned
at
the
great
interscholastic
competition
in
the
crowded
sorbonne
when
your
godson
received
the
first
prize
for
translation
at
the
school
distribution
he
got
two
first
prizes
one
for
verse
and
one
for
an
essay
i
went
quite
white
when
his
name
was
called
out
and
longed
to
shout
aloud
i
am
his
mother
little
nais
squeezed
my
hand
till
it
hurt
if
at
such
a
moment
it
were
possible
to
feel
pain
ah
louise
a
day
like
this
might
outweigh
many
a
dream
of
love
his
brother
triumphs
have
spurred
on
little
rene
who
wants
to
go
to
school
too
sometimes
the
three
children
make
such
a
racket
shouting
and
rushing
about
the
house
that
i
wonder
how
my
head
stands
it
i
am
always
with
them
no
one
else
not
even
mary
is
allowed
to
take
care
of
my
children
but
the
calling
of
a
mother
if
taxing
has
so
many
compensating
joys
to
see
a
child
leave
its
play
and
run
to
hug
one
out
of
the
fulness
of
its
heart
what
could
be
sweeter
then
it
is
only
in
being
constantly
with
them
that
one
can
study
their
characters
it
is
the
duty
of
a
mother
and
one
which
she
can
depute
to
no
hired
teacher
to
decipher
the
tastes
temper
and
natural
aptitudes
of
her
children
from
their
infancy
all
children
are
distinguished
by
ease
of
manner
and
tact
two
acquired
qualities
which
may
go
far
to
supply
the
lack
of
natural
ability
whereas
no
natural
ability
can
atone
for
the
loss
of
this
early
training
i
have
already
learned
to
discriminate
this
difference
of
tone
in
the
men
whom
i
meet
in
society
and
to
trace
the
hand
of
a
woman
in
the
formation
of
a
young
man
manners
how
could
any
woman
defraud
her
children
of
such
a
possession
you
see
what
rewards
attend
the
performance
of
my
tasks
armand
i
feel
certain
will
make
an
admirable
judge
the
most
upright
of
public
servants
the
most
devoted
of
deputies
and
where
would
you
find
a
sailor
bolder
more
adventurous
more
astute
than
my
rene
will
be
a
few
years
hence
the
little
rascal
has
already
an
iron
will
whatever
he
wants
he
manages
to
get
he
will
try
a
thousand
circuitous
ways
to
reach
his
end
and
if
not
successful
then
will
devise
a
thousand
and
first
where
dear
armand
quietly
resigns
himself
and
tries
to
get
at
the
reason
of
things
rene
will
storm
and
strive
and
puzzle
chattering
all
the
time
till
at
last
he
finds
some
chink
in
the
obstacle
if
there
is
room
for
the
blade
of
a
knife
to
pass
his
little
carriage
will
ride
through
in
triumph
and
nais
nais
is
so
completely
a
second
self
that
i
can
hardly
realize
her
as
distinct
from
my
own
flesh
and
blood
what
a
darling
she
is
and
how
i
love
to
make
a
little
lady
of
her
to
dress
her
curly
hair
tender
thoughts
mingling
the
while
with
every
touch
i
must
have
her
happy
i
shall
only
give
her
to
the
man
who
loves
her
and
whom
she
loves
but
heavens
when
i
let
her
put
on
her
little
ornaments
or
pass
a
ribbon
through
her
hair
or
fasten
the
shoes
on
her
tiny
feet
a
sickening
thought
comes
over
me
how
can
one
order
the
destiny
of
a
girl
who
can
say
that
she
will
not
love
a
scoundrel
or
some
man
who
is
indifferent
to
her
tears
often
spring
to
my
eyes
as
i
watch
her
this
lovely
creature
this
flower
this
rosebud
which
has
blossomed
in
one
heart
to
be
handed
over
to
a
man
who
will
tear
it
from
the
stem
and
leave
it
bare
louise
it
is
you
you
who
in
two
years
have
not
written
three
words
to
tell
me
of
your
welfare
it
is
you
who
have
recalled
to
my
mind
the
terrible
possibilities
of
marriage
so
full
of
anguish
for
a
mother
wrapped
up
as
i
am
in
her
child
farewell
now
for
in
truth
you
do
deserve
my
friendship
and
i
hardly
know
how
to
write
oh
answer
me
dear
louise
lii
mme
gaston
to
mme
de
the
chalet
so
after
a
silence
of
two
years
you
are
pricked
by
curiosity
and
want
to
know
why
i
have
not
written
my
dear
renee
there
are
no
words
no
images
no
language
to
express
my
happiness
that
we
have
strength
to
bear
it
sums
up
all
i
could
say
it
costs
us
no
effort
for
we
are
in
perfect
sympathy
the
whole
two
years
have
known
no
note
of
discord
in
the
harmony
no
jarring
word
in
the
interchange
of
feeling
no
shade
of
difference
in
our
lightest
wish
not
one
in
this
long
succession
of
days
has
failed
to
bear
its
own
peculiar
fruit
not
a
moment
has
passed
without
being
enriched
by
the
play
of
fancy
so
far
are
we
from
dreading
the
canker
of
monotony
in
our
life
that
our
only
fear
is
lest
it
should
not
be
long
enough
to
contain
all
the
poetic
creations
of
a
love
as
rich
and
varied
in
its
development
as
nature
herself
of
disappointment
not
a
trace
we
find
more
pleasure
in
being
together
than
on
the
first
day
and
each
hour
as
it
goes
by
discloses
fresh
reason
for
our
love
every
day
as
we
take
our
evening
stroll
after
dinner
we
tell
each
other
that
we
really
must
go
and
see
what
is
doing
in
paris
just
as
one
might
talk
of
going
to
switzerland
only
think
gaston
will
exclaim
such
and
such
a
boulevard
is
being
made
the
madeleine
is
finished
we
ought
to
see
it
let
us
go
and
comes
and
we
are
in
no
hurry
to
get
up
and
we
breakfast
in
our
bedroom
then
midday
is
on
us
and
it
is
too
hot
a
siesta
seems
appropriate
then
gaston
wishes
to
look
at
me
and
he
gazes
on
my
face
as
though
it
were
a
picture
losing
himself
in
this
contemplation
which
as
you
may
suppose
is
not
tears
rise
to
the
eyes
of
both
as
we
think
of
our
love
and
tremble
i
am
still
the
mistress
pretending
that
is
to
give
less
than
i
receive
and
i
revel
in
this
deception
to
a
woman
what
can
be
sweeter
than
to
see
passion
ever
held
in
check
by
tenderness
and
the
man
who
is
her
master
stayed
like
a
timid
suitor
by
a
word
from
her
within
the
limits
that
she
chooses
you
asked
me
to
describe
him
but
renee
it
is
not
possible
to
make
a
portrait
of
the
man
we
love
how
could
the
heart
be
kept
out
of
the
work
besides
to
be
frank
between
ourselves
we
may
admit
that
one
of
the
dire
effects
of
civilization
on
our
manners
is
to
make
of
man
in
society
a
being
so
utterly
different
from
the
natural
man
of
strong
feeling
that
sometimes
not
a
single
point
of
likeness
can
be
found
between
these
two
aspects
of
the
same
person
the
man
who
falls
into
the
most
graceful
operatic
poses
as
he
pours
sweet
nothings
into
your
ear
by
the
fire
at
night
may
be
entirely
destitute
of
those
more
intimate
charms
which
a
woman
values
on
the
other
hand
an
ugly
boorish
figure
may
mark
a
man
endowed
with
the
very
genius
of
love
and
who
has
a
perfect
mastery
over
situations
which
might
baffle
us
with
our
superficial
graces
a
man
whose
conventional
aspect
accords
with
his
real
nature
who
in
the
intimacy
of
wedded
love
possesses
that
inborn
grace
which
can
be
neither
given
nor
acquired
but
which
greek
art
has
embodied
in
statuary
that
careless
innocence
of
the
ancient
poets
which
even
in
frank
undress
seems
to
clothe
the
soul
as
with
a
veil
of
modesty
this
is
our
ideal
born
of
our
own
conceptions
and
linked
with
the
universal
harmony
which
seems
to
be
the
reality
underlying
all
created
things
to
find
this
ideal
in
life
is
the
problem
which
haunts
the
imagination
of
every
woman
in
gaston
i
have
found
it
ah
dear
i
did
not
know
what
love
could
be
united
to
youth
talent
and
beauty
gaston
has
no
affectations
he
moves
with
an
instinctive
and
unstudied
grace
when
we
walk
alone
together
in
the
woods
his
arm
round
my
waist
mine
resting
on
his
shoulder
body
fitting
to
body
and
head
touching
head
our
step
is
so
even
uniform
and
gentle
that
those
who
see
us
pass
by
night
take
the
vision
for
a
single
figure
gliding
over
the
graveled
walks
like
one
of
homer
immortals
a
like
harmony
exists
in
our
desires
our
thoughts
our
words
more
than
once
on
some
evening
when
a
passing
shower
has
left
the
leaves
glistening
and
the
moist
grass
bright
with
a
more
vivid
green
it
has
chanced
that
we
ended
our
walk
without
uttering
a
word
as
we
listened
to
the
patter
of
falling
drops
and
feasted
our
eyes
on
the
scarlet
sunset
flaring
on
the
hilltops
or
dyeing
with
a
warmer
tone
the
gray
of
the
tree
trunks
beyond
a
doubt
our
thoughts
then
rose
to
heaven
in
silent
prayer
pleading
as
it
were
for
our
happiness
at
times
a
cry
would
escape
us
at
the
moment
when
some
sudden
bend
on
the
path
opened
up
fresh
beauties
what
words
can
tell
how
how
full
of
meaning
is
a
kiss
exchanged
within
the
sanctuary
of
nature
it
is
as
though
god
had
created
us
to
worship
in
this
fashion
and
we
return
home
each
more
deeply
in
love
than
ever
a
love
so
passionate
between
old
married
people
would
be
an
outrage
on
society
in
paris
only
in
the
heart
of
the
woods
like
lovers
can
we
give
scope
to
it
to
come
to
particulars
gaston
is
of
middle
height
the
height
proper
to
all
men
of
purpose
neither
stout
nor
thin
his
figure
is
admirably
made
with
ample
fulness
in
the
proportions
while
every
motion
is
agile
he
leaps
a
ditch
with
the
easy
grace
of
a
wild
animal
whatever
his
attitude
he
seems
to
have
an
instinctive
sense
of
balance
and
this
is
very
rare
in
men
who
are
given
to
thought
though
a
dark
man
he
has
an
extraordinarily
fair
complexion
his
hair
contrasts
finely
with
the
lustreless
tints
of
the
neck
and
forehead
he
has
the
tragic
head
of
louis
xiii
his
moustache
and
tuft
have
been
allowed
to
grow
but
i
made
him
shave
the
whiskers
and
beard
which
were
getting
too
common
an
honorable
poverty
has
been
his
safeguard
and
handed
him
over
to
me
unsoiled
by
the
loose
life
which
ruins
so
many
young
men
his
teeth
are
magnificent
and
he
has
a
constitution
of
iron
his
keen
blue
eyes
for
me
full
of
tenderness
will
flash
like
lightning
at
any
rousing
thought
like
all
men
of
strong
character
and
powerful
mind
he
has
an
admirable
temper
its
evenness
would
surprise
you
as
it
did
me
i
have
listened
to
the
tale
of
many
a
woman
home
troubles
i
have
heard
of
the
moods
and
depression
of
men
dissatisfied
with
themselves
who
either
wo
get
old
or
age
ungracefully
men
who
carry
about
through
life
the
rankling
memory
of
some
youthful
excess
whose
veins
run
poison
and
whose
eyes
are
never
frankly
happy
men
who
cloak
suspicion
under
bad
temper
and
make
their
women
pay
for
an
hour
peace
by
a
morning
of
annoyance
who
take
vengeance
on
us
for
a
beauty
which
is
hateful
to
them
because
they
have
ceased
themselves
to
be
attractive
all
these
are
horrors
unknown
to
youth
they
are
the
penalty
of
unequal
unions
oh
my
dear
whatever
you
do
do
marry
athenais
to
an
old
man
but
his
smile
how
i
feast
on
it
a
smile
which
is
always
there
yet
always
fresh
through
the
play
of
subtle
fancy
a
speaking
smile
which
makes
of
the
lips
a
storehouse
for
thoughts
of
love
and
unspoken
gratitude
a
smile
which
links
present
joys
to
past
for
nothing
is
allowed
to
drop
out
of
our
common
life
the
smallest
works
of
nature
have
become
part
and
parcel
of
our
joy
in
these
delightful
woods
everything
is
alive
and
eloquent
of
ourselves
an
old
oak
near
the
woodsman
house
on
the
roadside
reminds
us
how
we
sat
there
wearied
under
its
shade
while
gaston
taught
me
about
the
mosses
at
our
feet
and
told
me
their
story
till
gradually
ascending
from
science
to
science
we
touched
the
very
confines
of
creation
there
is
something
so
kindred
in
our
minds
that
they
seem
to
me
like
two
editions
of
the
same
book
you
see
what
a
literary
tendency
i
have
developed
we
both
have
the
habit
or
the
gift
of
looking
at
every
subject
broadly
of
taking
in
all
its
points
of
view
and
the
proof
we
are
constantly
giving
ourselves
of
the
singleness
of
our
inward
vision
is
an
pleasure
we
have
actually
come
to
look
on
this
community
of
mind
as
a
pledge
of
love
and
if
it
ever
failed
us
it
would
mean
as
much
to
us
as
would
a
breach
of
fidelity
in
an
ordinary
home
my
life
full
as
it
is
of
pleasures
would
seem
to
you
nevertheless
extremely
laborious
to
begin
with
my
dear
you
must
know
that
de
chaulieu
does
her
own
room
i
could
not
bear
that
a
hired
menial
some
woman
or
girl
from
the
outside
should
become
initiated
literary
touch
again
into
the
secrets
of
my
bedroom
the
veriest
trifles
connected
with
the
worship
of
my
heart
partake
of
its
sacred
character
this
is
not
jealousy
it
is
thus
my
room
is
done
out
with
all
the
care
a
young
girl
in
love
bestows
on
her
person
and
with
the
precision
of
an
old
maid
my
is
no
chaos
of
litter
on
the
contrary
it
makes
a
charming
boudoir
my
keen
eye
has
foreseen
all
contingencies
at
whatever
hour
the
lord
and
master
enters
he
will
find
nothing
to
distress
surprise
or
shock
him
he
is
greeted
by
flowers
scents
and
everything
that
can
please
the
eye
i
get
up
in
the
early
dawn
while
he
is
still
sleeping
and
without
disturbing
him
pass
into
the
where
profiting
by
my
mother
experience
i
remove
the
traces
of
sleep
by
bathing
in
cold
water
for
during
sleep
the
skin
being
less
active
does
not
perform
its
functions
adequately
it
becomes
warm
and
covered
with
a
sort
of
mist
or
atmosphere
of
sticky
matter
visible
to
the
eye
from
a
a
woman
issues
ten
years
younger
and
this
perhaps
is
the
interpretation
of
the
myth
of
venus
rising
from
the
sea
so
the
cold
water
restores
to
me
the
saucy
charm
of
dawn
and
having
combed
and
scented
my
hair
and
made
a
most
fastidious
toilet
i
glide
back
in
order
that
my
master
may
find
me
dainty
as
a
spring
morning
at
his
wakening
he
is
charmed
with
this
freshness
as
of
a
flower
without
having
the
least
idea
how
it
is
produced
the
regular
toilet
of
the
day
is
a
matter
for
my
maid
and
this
takes
place
later
in
a
larger
room
set
aside
for
the
purpose
as
you
may
suppose
there
is
also
a
toilet
for
going
to
bed
three
times
a
day
you
see
or
it
may
be
four
do
i
array
myself
for
the
delight
of
my
husband
which
again
dear
one
is
suggestive
of
certain
ancient
myths
but
our
work
is
not
all
play
we
take
a
great
deal
of
interest
in
our
flowers
in
the
beauties
of
the
hothouse
and
in
our
trees
we
give
ourselves
in
all
seriousness
to
horticulture
and
embosom
the
chalet
in
flowers
of
which
we
are
passionately
fond
our
lawns
are
always
green
our
shrubberies
as
well
tended
as
those
of
a
millionaire
and
nothing
i
assure
you
can
match
the
beauty
of
our
walled
garden
we
are
regular
gluttons
over
our
fruit
and
watch
with
tender
interest
our
montreuil
peaches
our
hotbeds
our
laden
trellises
and
pyramidal
but
lest
these
rural
pursuits
should
fail
to
satisfy
my
beloved
mind
i
have
advised
him
to
finish
in
the
quiet
of
this
retreat
some
plays
which
were
begun
in
his
starvation
days
and
which
are
really
very
fine
this
is
the
only
kind
of
literary
work
which
can
be
done
in
odd
moments
for
it
requires
long
intervals
of
reflection
and
does
not
demand
the
elaborate
pruning
essential
to
a
finished
style
one
ca
make
a
of
dialogue
there
must
be
biting
touches
and
flashes
of
wit
which
are
the
blossoms
of
the
mind
and
come
rather
by
inspiration
than
reflection
this
sort
of
intellectual
sport
is
very
much
in
my
line
i
assist
gaston
in
his
work
and
in
this
way
manage
to
accompany
him
even
in
the
boldest
flights
of
his
imagination
do
you
see
now
how
it
is
that
my
winter
evenings
never
drag
our
servants
have
such
an
easy
time
that
never
once
since
we
were
married
have
we
had
to
reprimand
any
of
them
when
questioned
about
us
they
have
had
wit
enough
to
draw
on
their
imaginations
and
have
given
us
out
as
the
companion
and
secretary
of
a
lady
and
gentleman
supposed
to
be
traveling
they
never
go
out
without
asking
permission
which
they
know
will
not
be
refused
they
are
contented
too
and
see
plainly
that
it
will
be
their
own
fault
if
there
is
a
change
for
the
worse
the
gardeners
are
allowed
to
sell
the
surplus
of
our
fruits
and
vegetables
the
dairymaid
does
the
same
with
the
milk
the
cream
and
the
fresh
butter
on
condition
that
the
best
of
the
produce
is
reserved
for
us
they
are
well
pleased
with
their
profits
and
we
are
delighted
with
an
abundance
which
no
money
and
no
ingenuity
can
procure
in
that
terrible
paris
where
it
costs
a
hundred
francs
to
produce
a
single
fine
peach
all
this
is
not
without
its
meaning
my
dear
i
wish
to
fill
the
place
of
society
to
my
husband
now
society
is
amusing
and
therefore
his
solitude
must
not
be
allowed
to
pall
on
him
i
believed
myself
jealous
in
the
old
days
when
i
merely
allowed
myself
to
be
loved
now
i
know
real
jealousy
the
jealousy
of
the
lover
a
single
indifferent
glance
unnerves
me
from
time
to
time
i
say
to
myself
suppose
he
ceased
to
love
me
and
a
shudder
goes
through
me
i
tremble
before
him
as
the
christian
before
his
god
alas
renee
i
am
still
without
a
child
the
time
will
surely
come
it
must
come
when
our
hermitage
will
need
a
father
and
a
mother
care
to
brighten
it
when
we
shall
both
pine
to
see
the
little
frocks
and
pelisses
the
brown
or
golden
heads
leaping
running
through
our
shrubberies
and
flowery
paths
oh
it
is
a
cruel
jest
of
nature
a
flowering
tree
that
bears
no
fruit
the
thought
of
your
lovely
children
goes
through
me
like
a
knife
my
life
has
grown
narrower
while
yours
has
expanded
and
shed
its
rays
afar
the
passion
of
love
is
essentially
selfish
while
motherhood
widens
the
circle
of
our
feelings
how
well
i
felt
this
difference
when
i
read
your
kind
tender
letter
to
see
you
thus
living
in
three
hearts
roused
my
envy
yes
you
are
happy
you
have
had
wisdom
to
obey
the
laws
of
social
life
whilst
i
stand
outside
an
alien
children
dear
and
loving
children
can
alone
console
a
woman
for
the
loss
of
her
beauty
i
shall
soon
be
thirty
and
at
that
age
the
dirge
within
begins
what
though
i
am
still
beautiful
the
limits
of
my
woman
reign
are
none
the
less
in
sight
when
they
are
reached
what
then
i
shall
be
forty
before
he
is
i
shall
be
old
while
he
is
still
young
when
this
thought
goes
to
my
heart
i
lie
at
his
feet
for
an
hour
at
a
time
making
him
swear
to
tell
me
instantly
if
ever
he
feels
his
love
diminishing
but
he
is
a
child
he
swears
as
though
the
mere
suggestion
were
an
absurdity
and
he
is
so
beautiful
that
renee
you
understand
i
believe
him
sweet
one
shall
we
ever
again
let
years
pass
without
writing
happiness
is
a
monotonous
theme
and
that
is
perhaps
the
reason
why
to
souls
who
love
dante
appears
even
greater
in
the
than
in
the
i
am
not
dante
i
am
only
your
friend
and
i
want
to
bore
you
you
can
write
for
in
your
children
you
have
an
source
of
happiness
while
mine
no
more
of
this
a
thousand
loves
liii
mme
de
to
mme
gaston
my
dear
louise
i
have
read
and
your
letter
and
the
more
deeply
i
enter
into
its
spirit
the
clearer
does
it
become
to
me
that
it
is
the
letter
not
of
a
woman
but
of
a
child
you
are
the
same
old
louise
and
you
forget
what
i
used
to
repeat
over
and
over
again
to
you
that
the
passion
of
love
belongs
rightly
to
a
state
of
nature
and
has
only
been
purloined
by
civilization
so
fleeting
is
its
character
that
the
resources
of
society
are
powerless
to
modify
its
primitive
condition
and
it
becomes
the
effort
of
all
noble
minds
to
make
a
man
of
the
infant
cupid
but
as
you
yourself
admit
such
love
ceases
to
be
natural
society
my
dear
abhors
sterility
but
substituting
a
lasting
sentiment
for
the
mere
passing
frenzy
of
nature
it
has
succeeded
in
creating
that
greatest
of
all
human
inventions
the
family
which
is
the
enduring
basis
of
all
organized
society
to
the
accomplishment
of
this
end
it
has
sacrificed
the
individual
man
as
well
as
woman
for
we
must
not
shut
our
eyes
to
the
fact
that
a
married
man
devotes
his
energy
his
power
and
all
his
possession
to
his
wife
is
it
not
she
who
reaps
the
benefit
of
all
his
care
for
whom
if
not
for
her
are
the
luxury
and
wealth
the
position
and
distinction
the
comfort
and
the
gaiety
of
the
home
oh
my
sweet
once
again
you
have
taken
the
wrong
turning
in
life
to
be
adored
is
a
young
girl
dream
which
may
survive
a
few
springtimes
it
can
not
be
that
of
the
mature
woman
the
wife
and
mother
to
a
vanity
it
is
perhaps
enough
to
know
that
she
can
command
adoration
if
she
likes
if
you
would
live
the
life
of
a
wife
and
mother
return
i
beg
of
you
to
paris
let
me
repeat
my
warning
it
is
not
misfortune
which
you
have
to
dread
as
others
do
it
is
happiness
listen
to
me
my
child
it
is
the
simple
things
of
life
bread
air
silence
of
which
we
do
not
tire
they
have
no
piquancy
which
can
create
distaste
it
is
dishes
which
irritate
the
palate
and
in
the
end
exhaust
it
were
it
possible
that
i
should
be
loved
by
a
man
for
whom
i
could
conceive
a
passion
such
as
yours
for
gaston
i
would
still
cling
to
the
duties
and
the
children
who
are
so
dear
to
me
to
a
woman
heart
the
feelings
of
a
mother
are
among
the
simple
natural
fruitful
and
inexhaustible
things
of
life
i
can
recall
the
day
now
nearly
fourteen
years
ago
when
i
embarked
on
a
life
of
with
the
despair
of
a
shipwrecked
mariner
clinging
to
the
mast
of
his
vessel
now
as
i
invoke
the
memory
of
past
years
i
feel
that
i
would
make
the
same
choice
again
no
other
guiding
principle
is
so
safe
or
leads
to
such
rich
reward
the
spectacle
of
your
life
which
for
all
the
romance
and
poetry
with
which
you
invest
it
still
remains
based
on
nothing
but
a
ruthless
selfishness
has
helped
to
strengthen
my
convictions
this
is
the
last
time
i
shall
speak
to
you
in
this
way
but
i
could
not
refrain
from
once
more
pleading
with
you
when
i
found
that
your
happiness
had
been
proof
against
the
most
searching
of
all
trials
and
one
more
point
i
must
urge
on
you
suggested
by
my
meditations
on
your
retirement
life
whether
of
the
body
or
the
heart
consists
in
certain
balanced
movements
any
excess
introduced
into
the
working
of
this
routine
gives
rise
either
to
pain
or
to
pleasure
both
of
which
are
a
mere
fever
of
the
soul
bound
to
be
fugitive
because
nature
is
not
so
framed
as
to
support
it
long
but
to
make
of
life
one
long
excess
is
surely
to
choose
sickness
for
one
portion
you
are
sick
because
you
maintain
at
the
temperature
of
passion
a
feeling
which
marriage
ought
to
convert
into
a
steadying
purifying
influence
yes
my
sweet
i
see
it
clearly
now
the
glory
of
a
home
consists
in
this
very
calm
this
intimacy
this
sharing
alike
of
good
and
evil
which
the
vulgar
ridicule
how
noble
was
the
reply
of
the
duchesse
de
sully
the
wife
of
the
great
sully
to
some
one
who
remarked
that
her
husband
for
all
his
grave
exterior
did
not
scruple
to
keep
a
mistress
what
of
that
she
said
i
represent
the
honor
of
the
house
and
should
decline
to
play
the
part
of
a
courtesan
there
but
you
louise
who
are
naturally
more
passionate
than
tender
would
be
at
once
the
wife
and
the
mistress
with
the
soul
of
a
heloise
and
the
passions
of
a
saint
theresa
you
slip
the
leash
on
all
your
impulses
so
long
as
they
are
sanctioned
by
law
in
a
word
you
degrade
the
marriage
rite
surely
the
tables
are
turned
the
reproaches
you
once
heaped
on
me
for
immorally
as
you
said
seizing
the
means
of
happiness
from
the
very
outset
of
my
wedded
life
might
be
directed
against
yourself
for
grasping
at
everything
which
may
serve
your
passion
what
must
nature
and
society
alike
be
in
bondage
to
your
caprice
you
are
the
old
louise
you
have
never
acquired
the
qualities
which
ought
to
be
a
woman
and
unreasonable
as
a
girl
you
introduce
withal
into
your
love
the
keenest
and
most
mercenary
of
calculations
are
you
sure
that
after
all
the
price
you
ask
for
your
toilets
is
not
too
high
all
these
precautions
are
to
my
mind
very
suggestive
of
mistrust
oh
dear
louise
if
only
you
knew
the
sweetness
of
a
mother
efforts
to
discipline
herself
in
kindness
and
gentleness
to
all
about
her
my
proud
temper
gradually
dissolved
into
a
soft
melancholy
which
in
turn
has
been
swallowed
up
by
those
delights
of
motherhood
which
have
been
its
reward
if
the
early
hours
were
toilsome
the
evening
will
be
tranquil
and
clear
my
dread
is
lest
the
day
of
your
life
should
take
the
opposite
course
when
i
had
read
your
letter
to
a
close
i
prayed
god
to
send
you
among
us
for
a
day
that
you
might
see
what
family
life
really
is
and
learn
the
nature
of
those
joys
which
are
lasting
and
sweeter
than
tongue
can
tell
because
they
are
genuine
simple
and
natural
but
alas
what
chance
have
i
with
the
best
of
arguments
against
a
fallacy
which
makes
you
happy
as
i
write
these
words
my
eyes
fill
with
tears
i
had
felt
so
sure
that
some
months
of
honeymoon
would
prove
a
surfeit
and
restore
you
to
reason
but
i
see
that
there
is
no
limit
to
your
appetite
and
that
having
killed
a
man
who
loved
you
you
will
not
cease
till
you
have
killed
love
itself
farewell
dear
misguided
friend
i
am
in
despair
that
the
letter
which
i
hoped
might
reconcile
you
to
society
by
its
picture
of
my
happiness
should
have
brought
forth
only
a
paean
of
selfishness
yes
your
love
is
selfish
you
love
gaston
far
less
for
himself
than
for
what
he
is
to
you
liv
mme
gaston
to
the
comtesse
de
may
renee
calamity
has
come
no
that
is
no
word
for
it
it
has
burst
like
a
thunderbolt
over
your
poor
louise
you
know
what
that
means
calamity
for
me
is
doubt
certainty
would
be
death
the
day
before
yesterday
when
i
had
finished
my
first
toilet
i
looked
everywhere
for
gaston
to
take
a
little
turn
with
me
before
lunch
but
in
vain
i
went
to
the
stable
and
there
i
saw
his
mare
all
in
a
lather
while
the
groom
was
removing
the
foam
with
a
knife
before
rubbing
her
down
who
in
the
world
has
put
fedelta
in
such
a
state
i
asked
master
replied
the
lad
i
saw
the
mud
of
paris
on
the
mare
legs
for
country
mud
is
quite
different
and
at
once
it
flashed
through
me
he
has
been
to
paris
this
thought
raised
a
swarm
of
others
in
my
heart
and
it
seemed
as
though
all
the
life
in
my
body
rushed
there
to
go
to
paris
without
telling
me
at
the
hour
when
i
leave
him
alone
to
hasten
there
and
back
at
such
speed
as
to
distress
fedelta
suspicion
clutched
me
in
its
iron
grip
till
i
could
hardly
breathe
i
walked
aside
a
few
steps
to
a
seat
where
i
tried
to
recover
my
here
gaston
found
me
apparently
pale
and
fluttered
for
he
immediately
exclaimed
what
is
wrong
in
a
tone
of
such
alarm
that
i
rose
and
took
his
arm
but
my
muscles
refused
to
move
and
i
was
forced
to
sit
down
again
then
he
took
me
in
his
arms
and
carried
me
to
the
parlor
close
by
where
the
frightened
servants
pressed
after
us
till
gaston
motioned
them
away
once
left
to
ourselves
i
refused
to
speak
but
was
able
to
reach
my
room
where
i
shut
myself
in
to
weep
my
fill
gaston
remained
something
like
two
hours
at
my
door
listening
to
my
sobs
and
questioning
with
angelic
patience
his
poor
darling
who
made
no
response
at
last
i
told
him
that
i
would
see
him
when
my
eyes
were
less
red
and
my
voice
was
steady
again
my
formal
words
drove
him
from
the
house
but
by
the
time
i
had
bathed
my
eyes
in
iced
water
and
cooled
my
face
i
found
him
in
our
room
the
door
into
which
was
open
though
i
had
heard
no
steps
he
begged
me
to
tell
him
what
was
wrong
nothing
i
said
i
saw
the
mud
of
paris
on
fedelta
trembling
legs
it
seemed
strange
that
you
should
go
there
without
telling
me
but
of
course
you
are
free
i
shall
punish
you
for
such
wicked
thoughts
by
not
giving
any
explanation
till
he
replied
look
at
me
i
said
my
eyes
met
his
deep
answered
to
deep
no
not
a
trace
of
the
cloud
of
disloyalty
which
rising
from
the
soul
must
dim
the
clearness
of
the
eye
i
feigned
satisfaction
though
really
unconvinced
it
is
not
women
only
who
can
lie
and
dissemble
the
whole
of
the
day
we
spent
together
ever
and
again
as
i
looked
at
him
i
realized
how
fast
my
were
bound
to
him
how
i
trembled
and
fluttered
within
when
after
a
moment
absence
he
reappeared
i
live
in
him
not
in
myself
my
cruel
sufferings
gave
the
lie
to
your
unkind
letter
did
i
ever
feel
my
life
thus
bound
up
in
the
noble
spaniard
who
adored
me
as
i
adore
this
heartless
boy
i
hate
that
mare
fool
that
i
was
to
keep
horses
but
the
next
thing
would
have
been
to
lame
gaston
or
imprison
him
in
the
cottage
wild
thoughts
like
these
filled
my
brain
you
see
how
near
i
was
to
madness
if
love
be
not
the
cage
what
power
on
earth
can
hold
back
the
man
who
wants
to
be
free
i
asked
him
do
i
bore
you
what
needless
torture
you
give
yourself
was
his
reply
while
he
looked
at
me
with
tender
pitying
eyes
never
have
i
loved
you
so
deeply
if
that
is
true
my
beloved
let
me
sell
fedelta
i
answered
sell
her
by
all
means
the
reply
crushed
me
was
it
not
a
covert
taunt
at
my
wealth
and
his
own
nothingness
in
the
house
this
may
never
have
occurred
to
him
but
i
thought
it
had
and
once
more
i
left
him
it
was
night
and
i
would
go
to
bed
oh
renee
to
be
alone
with
a
harrowing
thought
drives
one
to
thoughts
of
death
these
charming
gardens
the
starry
night
the
cool
air
laden
with
incense
from
our
wealth
of
flowers
our
valley
our
hills
all
seemed
to
me
gloomy
black
and
desolate
it
was
as
though
i
lay
at
the
foot
of
a
precipice
surrounded
by
serpents
and
poisonous
plants
and
saw
no
god
in
the
sky
such
a
night
ages
a
woman
next
morning
i
said
take
fedelta
and
be
off
to
paris
do
sell
her
i
love
her
does
she
not
carry
you
but
he
was
not
deceived
my
tone
betrayed
the
storm
of
feeling
which
i
strove
to
conceal
trust
me
he
replied
and
the
gesture
with
which
he
held
out
his
hand
the
glance
of
his
eye
were
so
full
of
loyalty
that
i
was
overcome
what
petty
creatures
women
are
i
exclaimed
no
you
love
me
that
is
all
he
said
pressing
me
to
his
heart
go
to
paris
without
me
i
said
and
this
time
i
made
him
understand
that
my
suspicions
were
laid
aside
he
went
i
thought
he
would
have
stayed
i
wo
attempt
to
tell
you
what
i
suffered
i
found
a
second
self
within
quite
strange
to
me
a
crisis
like
this
has
for
the
woman
who
loves
a
tragic
solemnity
that
baffles
words
the
whole
of
life
rises
before
you
then
and
you
search
in
vain
for
any
horizon
to
it
the
veriest
trifle
is
big
with
meaning
a
glance
contains
a
volume
icicles
drift
on
uttered
words
and
the
death
sentence
is
read
in
a
movement
of
the
lips
i
thought
he
would
have
paid
me
back
in
kind
had
i
not
been
magnanimous
i
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
chalet
and
my
eyes
followed
him
on
the
road
ah
my
dear
renee
he
vanished
from
my
sight
with
an
appalling
swiftness
how
keen
he
is
to
go
was
the
thought
that
sprang
of
itself
once
more
alone
i
fell
back
into
the
hell
of
possibilities
the
maelstrom
of
mistrust
there
were
moments
when
i
would
have
welcomed
any
certainty
even
the
worst
as
a
relief
from
the
torture
of
suspense
suspense
is
a
duel
carried
on
in
the
heart
and
we
give
no
quarter
to
ourselves
i
paced
up
and
down
the
walks
i
returned
to
the
house
only
to
tear
out
again
like
a
mad
woman
gaston
who
left
at
seven
did
not
return
till
eleven
now
as
it
only
takes
half
an
hour
to
reach
paris
through
the
park
of
st
cloud
and
the
bois
de
boulogne
it
is
plain
that
he
must
have
spent
three
hours
in
town
he
came
back
radiant
with
a
whip
in
his
hand
for
me
an
whip
with
a
gold
handle
for
a
fortnight
i
had
been
without
a
whip
my
old
one
being
worn
and
broken
was
it
for
this
you
tortured
me
i
said
as
i
admired
the
workmanship
of
this
beautiful
ornament
which
contains
a
little
at
one
end
then
it
flashed
on
me
that
the
present
was
a
fresh
artifice
nevertheless
i
threw
myself
at
once
on
his
neck
not
without
reproaching
him
gently
for
having
caused
me
so
much
pain
for
the
sake
of
a
trifle
he
was
greatly
pleased
with
his
ingenuity
his
eyes
and
his
whole
bearing
plainly
showed
the
restrained
triumph
of
the
successful
plotter
for
there
is
a
radiance
of
the
soul
which
is
reflected
in
every
feature
and
turn
of
the
body
while
still
examining
the
beauties
of
this
work
of
art
i
asked
him
at
a
moment
when
we
happened
to
be
looking
each
other
in
the
face
who
is
the
artist
a
friend
of
mine
ah
i
see
it
has
been
mounted
by
verdier
and
i
read
the
name
of
the
shop
printed
on
the
handle
gaston
is
nothing
but
a
child
yet
he
blushed
and
i
made
much
of
him
as
a
reward
for
the
shame
he
felt
in
deceiving
me
i
pretended
to
notice
nothing
and
he
may
well
have
thought
the
incident
was
over
may
the
next
morning
i
was
in
my
by
six
and
by
seven
landed
at
verdier
where
several
whips
of
the
same
pattern
were
shown
to
me
one
of
the
men
serving
recognized
mine
when
i
pointed
it
out
to
him
we
sold
that
yesterday
to
a
young
gentleman
he
said
and
from
the
description
i
gave
him
of
my
traitor
gaston
not
a
doubt
was
left
of
his
identity
i
will
spare
you
the
palpitations
which
rent
my
heart
during
that
journey
to
paris
and
the
little
scene
there
which
marked
the
of
my
life
by
i
was
home
again
and
gaston
found
me
fresh
and
blooming
in
my
morning
dress
sauntering
about
with
a
nonchalance
i
felt
confident
that
old
philippe
who
had
been
taken
into
my
confidence
would
not
have
betrayed
my
absence
gaston
i
said
as
we
walked
by
the
side
of
the
lake
you
can
not
blind
me
to
the
difference
between
a
work
of
art
inspired
by
friendship
and
something
which
has
been
cast
in
a
mould
he
turned
white
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
me
rather
than
on
the
damaging
piece
of
evidence
i
thrust
before
them
my
dear
i
went
on
this
is
not
a
whip
it
is
a
screen
behind
which
you
are
hiding
something
from
me
thereupon
i
gave
myself
the
gratification
of
watching
his
hopeless
entanglement
in
the
coverts
and
labyrinths
of
deceit
and
the
desperate
efforts
he
made
to
find
some
wall
he
might
scale
and
thus
escape
in
vain
he
had
perforce
to
remain
upon
the
field
face
to
face
with
an
adversary
who
at
last
laid
down
her
arms
in
a
feigned
complacence
but
it
was
too
late
the
fatal
mistake
against
which
my
mother
had
tried
to
warm
me
was
made
my
jealousy
exposed
in
all
its
nakedness
had
led
to
war
and
all
its
stratagems
between
gaston
and
myself
jealousy
dear
has
neither
sense
nor
decency
i
made
up
my
mind
now
to
suffer
in
silence
but
to
keep
my
eyes
open
until
my
doubts
were
resolved
one
way
or
another
then
i
would
either
break
with
gaston
or
bow
to
my
misfortune
no
middle
course
is
possible
for
a
woman
who
respects
herself
what
can
he
be
concealing
for
a
secret
there
is
and
the
secret
has
to
do
with
a
woman
is
it
some
youthful
escapade
for
which
he
still
blushes
but
if
so
what
the
word
is
written
in
letters
of
fire
on
all
i
see
i
read
it
in
the
glassy
water
of
my
lake
in
the
shrubbery
in
the
clouds
on
the
ceilings
at
table
in
the
flowers
of
the
carpets
a
voice
cries
to
me
in
my
sleep
dating
from
the
morning
of
my
discovery
a
cruel
interest
has
sprung
into
our
lives
and
i
have
become
familiar
with
the
bitterest
thought
that
can
corrode
the
heart
the
thought
of
treachery
in
him
one
loves
oh
my
dear
there
is
heaven
and
hell
together
in
such
a
life
never
had
i
felt
this
scorching
flame
i
to
whom
love
had
appeared
only
in
the
form
of
devoutest
worship
so
you
wished
to
know
the
gloomy
of
pain
i
said
to
myself
good
the
spirits
of
evil
have
heard
your
prayer
go
on
your
road
unhappy
wretch
may
since
that
fatal
day
gaston
no
longer
works
with
the
careless
ease
of
the
wealthy
artist
whose
work
is
merely
pastime
he
sets
himself
tasks
like
a
professional
writer
four
hours
a
day
he
devotes
to
finishing
his
two
plays
he
wants
money
a
voice
within
whispered
the
thought
but
why
he
spends
next
to
nothing
we
have
absolutely
no
secrets
from
each
other
there
is
not
a
corner
of
his
study
which
my
eyes
and
my
fingers
may
not
explore
his
yearly
expenditure
does
not
amount
to
two
thousand
francs
and
i
know
that
he
has
thirty
thousand
i
can
hardly
say
laid
by
but
scattered
loose
in
a
drawer
you
can
guess
what
is
coming
at
midnight
while
he
was
sleeping
i
went
to
see
if
the
money
was
still
there
an
icy
shiver
ran
through
me
the
drawer
was
empty
that
same
week
i
discovered
that
he
went
to
sevres
to
fetch
his
letters
and
these
letters
he
must
tear
up
immediately
for
though
i
am
a
very
figaro
in
contrivances
i
have
never
yet
seen
a
trace
of
one
alas
my
sweet
despite
the
fine
promises
and
vows
by
which
i
bound
myself
after
the
scene
of
the
whip
an
impulse
which
i
can
only
call
madness
drove
me
to
follow
him
in
one
of
his
rapid
rides
to
the
gaston
was
appalled
to
be
thus
discovered
on
horseback
paying
the
postage
of
a
letter
which
he
held
in
his
hand
he
looked
fixedly
at
me
and
then
put
spurs
to
fedelta
the
pace
was
so
hard
that
i
felt
shaken
to
bits
when
i
reached
the
lodge
gate
though
my
mental
agony
was
such
at
the
time
that
it
might
well
have
dulled
all
consciousness
of
bodily
pain
arrived
at
the
gate
gaston
said
nothing
he
rang
the
bell
and
waited
without
a
word
i
was
more
dead
than
alive
i
might
be
mistaken
or
i
might
not
but
in
neither
case
was
it
fitting
for
de
chaulieu
to
play
the
spy
i
had
sunk
to
the
level
of
the
gutter
by
the
side
of
courtesans
mere
creatures
of
instinct
even
the
vulgar
or
humble
seamstress
might
look
down
on
me
what
a
moment
at
last
the
door
opened
he
handed
his
horse
to
the
groom
and
i
also
dismounted
but
into
his
arms
which
were
stretched
out
to
receive
me
i
threw
my
skirt
over
my
left
arm
gave
him
my
right
and
we
walked
on
still
in
silence
the
few
steps
we
thus
took
might
be
reckoned
to
me
for
a
hundred
years
of
purgatory
a
swarm
of
thoughts
beset
me
as
i
walked
now
seeming
to
take
visible
form
in
tongues
of
fire
before
my
eyes
now
assailing
my
mind
each
with
its
own
poisoned
dart
when
the
groom
and
the
horses
were
far
away
i
stopped
gaston
and
looking
him
in
the
face
said
as
i
pointed
with
a
gesture
that
you
should
have
seen
to
the
fatal
letter
still
in
his
right
hand
may
i
read
it
he
gave
it
to
me
i
opened
it
and
found
a
letter
from
nathan
the
dramatic
author
informing
gaston
that
a
play
of
his
had
been
accepted
learned
rehearsed
and
would
be
produced
the
following
saturday
he
also
enclosed
a
box
ticket
though
for
me
this
was
the
opening
of
heaven
gates
to
the
martyr
yet
the
fiend
would
not
leave
me
in
peace
but
kept
crying
where
are
the
thirty
thousand
francs
it
was
a
question
which
dignity
all
my
old
self
in
fact
prevented
me
from
uttering
if
my
thought
became
speech
i
might
as
well
throw
myself
into
the
lake
at
once
and
yet
i
could
hardly
keep
the
words
down
dear
friend
was
not
this
a
trial
passing
the
strength
of
woman
i
returned
the
letter
saying
my
poor
gaston
you
are
getting
bored
down
here
let
us
go
back
to
paris
wo
you
to
paris
he
said
but
why
i
only
wanted
to
find
out
if
i
had
any
gift
to
taste
the
flowing
bowl
of
success
nothing
would
be
easier
than
for
me
to
ransack
the
drawer
sometime
while
he
is
working
and
pretend
great
surprise
at
finding
the
money
gone
but
that
would
be
going
to
meet
the
answer
oh
my
friend
was
hard
up
which
a
man
of
gaston
quick
wit
would
not
have
far
to
seek
the
moral
my
dear
is
that
the
brilliant
success
of
this
play
which
all
paris
is
crowding
to
see
is
due
to
us
though
the
whole
credit
goes
to
nathan
i
am
represented
by
one
of
the
two
stars
in
the
legend
et
m
i
saw
the
first
night
from
the
depths
of
one
of
the
stage
boxes
july
gaston
work
and
his
visits
to
paris
shall
continue
he
is
preparing
new
plays
partly
because
he
wants
a
pretext
for
going
to
paris
partly
in
order
to
make
money
three
plays
have
been
accepted
and
two
more
are
commissioned
oh
my
dear
i
am
lost
all
is
darkness
around
me
i
would
set
fire
to
the
house
in
a
moment
if
that
would
bring
light
what
does
it
all
mean
is
he
ashamed
of
taking
money
from
me
he
is
too
for
so
trumpery
a
matter
to
weigh
with
him
besides
scruples
of
the
kind
could
only
be
the
outcome
of
some
love
affair
a
man
would
take
anything
from
his
wife
but
from
the
woman
he
has
ceased
to
care
for
or
is
thinking
of
deserting
it
is
different
if
he
needs
such
large
sums
it
must
be
to
spend
them
on
a
woman
for
himself
why
should
he
hesitate
to
draw
from
my
purse
our
savings
amount
to
one
hundred
thousand
francs
in
short
my
sweetheart
i
have
explored
a
whole
continent
of
possibilities
and
after
carefully
weighing
all
the
evidence
am
convinced
i
have
a
rival
i
am
deserted
for
whom
at
all
costs
i
must
see
the
unknown
july
light
has
come
and
it
is
all
over
with
me
yes
renee
at
the
age
of
thirty
in
the
perfection
of
my
beauty
with
all
the
resources
of
a
ready
wit
and
the
seductive
charms
of
dress
at
my
command
i
am
betrayed
and
for
whom
a
englishwoman
with
big
feet
and
thick
waist
a
regular
british
cow
there
is
no
longer
room
for
doubt
i
will
tell
you
the
history
of
the
last
few
days
worn
out
with
suspicions
which
were
fed
by
gaston
guilty
silence
for
if
he
had
helped
a
friend
why
keep
it
a
secret
from
me
his
insatiable
desire
for
money
and
his
frequent
journeys
to
paris
jealous
too
of
the
work
from
which
he
seemed
unable
to
tear
himself
i
at
last
made
up
my
mind
to
take
certain
steps
of
such
a
degrading
nature
that
i
can
not
tell
you
about
them
suffice
it
to
say
that
three
days
ago
i
ascertained
that
gaston
when
in
paris
visits
a
house
in
the
rue
de
la
ville
where
he
guards
his
mistress
with
jealous
mystery
unexampled
in
paris
the
porter
was
surly
and
i
could
get
little
out
of
him
but
that
little
was
enough
to
put
an
end
to
any
lingering
hope
and
with
hope
to
life
on
this
point
my
mind
was
resolved
and
i
only
waited
to
learn
the
whole
truth
first
with
this
object
i
went
to
paris
and
took
rooms
in
a
house
exactly
opposite
the
one
which
gaston
visits
thence
i
saw
him
with
my
own
eyes
enter
the
courtyard
on
horseback
too
soon
a
ghastly
fact
forced
itself
on
me
this
englishwoman
who
seems
to
me
about
is
known
as
mme
gaston
this
discovery
was
my
deathblow
i
saw
him
next
walking
to
the
tuileries
with
a
couple
of
children
oh
my
dear
two
children
the
living
images
of
gaston
the
likeness
is
so
strong
that
it
bears
scandal
on
the
face
of
it
and
what
pretty
children
in
their
handsome
english
costumes
she
is
the
mother
of
his
children
here
is
the
key
to
the
whole
mystery
the
woman
herself
might
be
a
greek
statue
stepped
down
from
some
monument
cold
and
white
as
marble
she
moves
sedately
with
a
pride
she
is
undeniably
beautiful
but
heavy
as
a
there
is
no
breeding
or
distinction
about
her
nothing
of
the
english
lady
probably
she
is
a
farmer
daughter
from
some
wretched
and
remote
country
village
or
it
may
be
the
eleventh
child
of
some
poor
clergyman
i
reached
home
after
a
miserable
journey
during
which
all
sorts
of
fiendish
thoughts
had
me
at
their
mercy
with
hardly
any
life
left
in
me
was
she
married
did
he
know
her
before
our
marriage
had
she
been
deserted
by
some
rich
man
whose
mistress
she
was
and
thus
thrown
back
upon
gaston
hands
conjectures
without
end
flitted
through
my
brain
as
though
conjecture
were
needed
in
the
presence
of
the
children
the
next
day
i
returned
to
paris
and
by
a
free
use
of
my
purse
extracted
from
the
porter
the
information
that
mme
gaston
was
legally
married
his
reply
to
my
question
took
the
form
yes
july
my
dear
my
love
for
gaston
is
stronger
than
ever
since
that
morning
and
he
has
every
appearance
of
being
still
more
deeply
in
love
he
is
so
young
a
score
of
times
it
has
been
on
my
lips
when
we
rise
in
the
morning
to
say
then
you
love
me
better
than
the
lady
of
the
rue
de
la
ville
but
i
dare
not
explain
to
myself
why
the
words
are
checked
on
my
tongue
are
you
very
fond
of
children
i
asked
oh
yes
was
his
reply
but
children
will
come
what
makes
you
think
so
i
have
consulted
the
best
doctors
and
they
agree
in
advising
me
to
travel
for
a
couple
of
months
gaston
i
said
if
love
in
absence
had
been
possible
for
me
do
you
suppose
i
should
ever
have
left
the
convent
he
laughed
but
as
for
me
dear
the
word
travel
pierced
my
heart
rather
far
rather
would
i
leap
from
the
top
of
the
house
than
be
rolled
down
the
staircase
step
by
farewell
my
sweetheart
i
have
arranged
for
my
death
to
be
easy
and
without
horrors
but
certain
i
made
my
will
yesterday
you
can
come
to
me
now
the
prohibition
is
removed
come
then
and
receive
my
last
farewell
i
will
not
die
by
inches
my
death
like
my
life
shall
bear
the
impress
of
dignity
and
grace
dear
sister
soul
whose
affection
has
never
wavered
nor
grown
weary
but
has
been
the
constant
tender
moonlight
of
my
soul
if
the
intensity
of
passion
has
not
been
ours
at
least
we
have
been
spared
its
venomous
bitterness
how
rightly
you
have
judged
of
life
farewell
lv
the
comtesse
de
to
mme
gaston
july
my
dear
louise
i
send
this
letter
by
an
express
before
hastening
to
the
chalet
myself
take
courage
your
last
letter
seemed
to
me
so
frantic
that
i
thought
myself
justified
under
the
circumstances
in
confiding
all
to
louis
it
was
a
question
of
saving
you
from
yourself
if
the
means
we
have
employed
have
been
like
yours
repulsive
yet
the
result
is
so
satisfactory
that
i
am
certain
you
will
approve
i
went
so
far
as
to
set
the
police
to
work
but
the
whole
thing
remains
a
secret
between
the
prefect
ourselves
and
you
in
one
word
gaston
is
a
jewel
but
here
are
the
facts
his
brother
louis
gaston
died
at
calcutta
while
in
the
service
of
a
mercantile
company
when
he
was
on
the
very
point
of
returning
to
france
a
rich
prosperous
married
man
having
received
a
very
large
fortune
with
his
wife
who
was
the
widow
of
an
english
merchant
for
ten
years
he
had
worked
hard
that
he
might
be
able
to
send
home
enough
to
support
his
brother
to
whom
he
was
devotedly
attached
and
from
whom
his
letters
generously
concealed
all
his
trials
and
disappointments
then
came
the
failure
of
the
great
halmer
house
the
widow
was
ruined
and
the
sudden
shock
affected
louis
gaston
brain
he
had
no
mental
energy
left
to
resist
the
disease
which
attacked
him
and
he
died
in
bengal
whither
he
had
gone
to
try
and
realize
the
remnants
of
his
wife
property
the
dear
good
fellow
had
deposited
with
a
banker
a
first
sum
of
three
hundred
thousand
francs
which
was
to
go
to
his
brother
but
the
banker
was
involved
in
the
halmer
crash
and
thus
their
last
resource
failed
them
louis
widow
the
handsome
woman
whom
you
took
for
your
rival
arrived
in
paris
with
two
children
your
nephews
and
an
empty
purse
her
mother
jewels
having
barely
sufficed
to
pay
for
bringing
them
over
the
instructions
which
louis
gaston
had
given
the
banker
for
sending
the
money
to
his
brother
enabled
the
widow
to
find
your
husband
former
home
as
gaston
had
disappeared
without
leaving
any
address
mme
louis
gaston
was
directed
to
the
only
person
who
could
give
any
information
about
him
was
the
more
ready
to
relieve
the
young
woman
pressing
needs
because
louis
gaston
at
the
time
of
his
marriage
four
years
before
had
written
to
make
inquiries
about
his
brother
from
the
famous
author
whom
he
knew
to
be
one
of
his
friends
the
captain
had
consulted
as
to
the
best
means
of
getting
the
money
safely
transferred
to
marie
and
had
replied
telling
him
that
gaston
was
now
a
rich
man
through
his
marriage
with
the
baronne
de
macumer
the
personal
beauty
which
was
the
mother
rich
heritage
to
her
sons
had
saved
them
both
one
in
india
the
other
in
paris
from
destitution
a
touching
story
is
it
not
naturally
wrote
after
a
time
to
tell
your
husband
of
the
condition
of
his
and
her
children
informing
him
at
the
same
time
of
the
generous
intentions
of
the
indian
gaston
towards
his
paris
brother
which
an
unhappy
chance
had
frustrated
gaston
as
you
may
imagine
hurried
off
to
paris
here
is
the
first
ride
accounted
for
during
the
last
five
years
he
had
saved
fifty
thousand
francs
out
of
the
income
you
forced
him
to
accept
and
this
sum
he
invested
in
the
public
funds
under
the
names
of
his
two
nephews
securing
them
each
in
this
way
an
income
of
twelve
hundred
francs
next
he
furnished
his
rooms
and
promised
her
a
quarterly
allowance
of
three
thousand
francs
here
you
see
the
meaning
of
his
dramatic
labors
and
the
pleasure
caused
him
by
the
success
of
his
first
play
mme
gaston
therefore
is
no
rival
of
yours
and
has
every
right
to
your
name
a
man
of
gaston
sensitive
delicacy
was
bound
to
keep
the
affair
secret
from
you
knowing
as
he
did
your
generous
nature
nor
does
he
look
on
what
you
give
him
as
his
own
read
me
the
letter
he
had
from
your
husband
asking
him
to
be
one
of
the
witnesses
at
his
marriage
gaston
in
this
declares
that
his
happiness
would
have
been
perfect
but
for
the
one
drawback
of
his
poverty
and
indebtedness
to
you
a
virgin
soul
is
at
the
mercy
of
such
scruples
either
they
make
themselves
felt
or
they
do
not
and
when
they
do
it
is
easy
to
imagine
the
conflict
of
feeling
and
embarrassment
to
which
they
give
rise
nothing
is
more
natural
than
gaston
wish
to
provide
in
secret
a
suitable
maintenance
for
the
woman
who
is
his
brother
widow
and
who
had
herself
set
aside
one
hundred
thousand
francs
for
him
from
her
own
fortune
she
is
a
handsome
woman
and
extremely
but
not
clever
she
is
a
mother
and
you
may
be
sure
i
lost
my
heart
to
her
at
first
sight
when
i
found
her
with
one
child
in
her
arms
and
the
other
dressed
like
a
little
lord
the
children
first
is
written
in
every
detail
of
her
house
far
from
being
angry
therefore
with
your
beloved
husband
you
should
find
in
all
this
fresh
reason
for
loving
him
i
have
met
him
and
think
him
the
most
delightful
young
fellow
in
paris
yes
dear
child
when
i
saw
him
i
had
no
difficulty
in
understanding
that
a
woman
might
lose
her
head
about
him
his
soul
is
mirrored
in
his
countenance
if
i
were
you
i
should
settle
the
widow
and
her
children
at
the
chalet
in
a
pretty
little
cottage
which
you
could
have
built
for
them
and
adopt
the
boys
be
at
peace
then
dear
soul
and
plan
this
little
surprise
in
your
turn
for
gaston
lvi
mme
gaston
to
the
comtesse
de
ah
my
dear
friend
what
can
i
say
in
answer
except
the
cruel
it
is
too
late
of
that
fool
lafayette
to
his
royal
master
oh
my
life
my
sweet
life
what
physician
will
give
it
back
to
me
my
own
hand
has
dealt
the
deathblow
alas
have
i
not
been
a
mere
whose
twinkling
spark
was
fated
to
perish
before
it
reached
a
flame
my
eyes
rain
torrents
of
tears
and
yet
they
must
not
fall
when
i
am
with
him
i
fly
to
him
and
he
seeks
me
my
despair
is
all
within
this
torture
dante
forgot
to
place
in
his
come
to
see
me
die
lvii
the
comtesse
de
to
the
comte
de
the
chalet
august
my
love
take
the
children
away
to
provence
without
me
i
remain
with
louise
who
has
only
a
few
days
yet
to
live
i
can
not
leave
either
her
or
her
husband
for
whose
reason
i
fear
you
know
the
scrap
of
letter
which
sent
me
flying
to
ville
picking
up
the
doctors
on
my
way
since
then
i
have
not
left
my
darling
friend
and
it
has
been
impossible
to
write
to
you
for
i
have
sat
up
every
night
for
a
fortnight
when
i
arrived
i
found
her
with
gaston
in
full
dress
beautiful
laughing
happy
it
was
a
heroic
falsehood
they
were
like
two
lovely
children
together
in
their
restored
confidence
for
a
moment
i
was
deceived
like
gaston
by
the
effrontery
but
louise
pressed
my
hand
whispering
he
must
not
know
i
am
dying
an
icy
chill
fell
over
me
as
i
felt
her
burning
hand
and
saw
the
red
spots
on
her
cheeks
i
congratulated
myself
on
my
prudence
in
leaving
the
doctors
in
the
wood
till
they
should
be
sent
for
leave
us
for
a
little
she
said
to
gaston
two
women
who
have
not
met
for
five
years
have
plenty
of
secrets
to
talk
over
and
renee
i
have
no
doubt
has
things
to
confide
in
me
directly
we
were
alone
she
flung
herself
into
my
arms
unable
longer
to
restrain
her
tears
tell
me
about
it
i
said
i
have
brought
with
me
in
case
of
need
the
best
surgeon
and
the
best
physician
from
the
hospital
and
bianchon
as
well
there
are
four
altogether
ah
she
cried
have
them
in
at
once
if
they
can
save
me
if
there
is
still
time
the
passion
which
hurried
me
to
death
now
cries
for
life
but
what
have
you
done
to
yourself
i
have
in
a
few
days
brought
myself
to
the
last
stage
of
consumption
but
how
i
got
myself
into
a
profuse
perspiration
in
the
night
and
then
ran
out
and
lay
down
by
the
side
of
the
lake
in
the
dew
gaston
thinks
i
have
a
cold
and
i
am
dying
send
him
to
paris
i
will
fetch
the
doctors
myself
i
said
as
i
rushed
out
wildly
to
the
spot
where
i
had
left
them
alas
my
love
after
the
consultation
was
over
not
one
of
the
doctors
gave
me
the
least
hope
they
all
believe
that
louise
will
die
with
the
fall
of
the
leaves
the
dear
child
constitution
has
wonderfully
helped
the
success
of
her
plan
it
seems
she
has
a
predisposition
to
this
complaint
and
though
in
the
ordinary
course
she
might
have
lived
a
long
time
a
few
days
folly
has
made
the
case
desperate
i
can
not
tell
you
what
i
felt
on
hearing
this
sentence
based
on
such
clear
explanations
you
know
that
i
have
lived
in
louise
as
much
as
in
my
own
life
i
was
simply
crushed
and
could
not
stir
to
escort
to
the
door
these
harbingers
of
evil
i
do
know
how
long
i
remained
lost
in
bitter
thoughts
the
tears
running
down
my
cheeks
when
i
was
roused
from
my
stupor
by
the
words
so
there
is
no
hope
for
me
in
a
clear
angelic
voice
it
was
louise
with
her
hand
on
my
shoulder
she
made
me
get
up
and
carried
me
off
to
her
small
with
a
beseeching
glance
she
went
on
stay
with
me
to
the
end
i
wo
have
doleful
faces
round
me
above
all
i
must
keep
the
truth
from
i
know
that
i
have
the
strength
to
do
it
i
am
full
of
youth
and
spirit
and
can
die
standing
for
myself
i
have
no
regrets
i
am
dying
as
i
wished
to
die
still
young
and
beautiful
in
the
perfection
of
my
womanhood
as
for
him
i
can
see
very
well
now
that
i
should
have
made
his
life
miserable
passion
has
me
in
its
grips
like
a
struggling
fawn
impatient
of
the
toils
my
groundless
jealousy
has
already
wounded
him
sorely
when
the
day
came
that
my
suspicions
met
only
indifference
which
in
the
long
run
is
the
rightful
meed
of
all
jealousy
well
that
would
have
been
my
death
i
have
had
my
share
of
life
there
are
people
whose
names
on
the
of
the
world
show
sixty
years
of
service
and
yet
in
all
that
time
they
have
not
had
two
years
of
real
life
whilst
my
record
of
thirty
is
doubled
by
the
intensity
of
my
love
thus
for
him
as
well
as
for
me
the
close
is
a
happy
one
but
between
us
dear
renee
it
is
different
you
lose
a
loving
sister
and
that
is
a
loss
which
nothing
can
repair
you
alone
here
have
the
right
to
mourn
my
death
after
a
long
pause
during
which
i
could
only
see
her
through
a
mist
of
tears
she
continued
the
moral
of
my
death
is
a
cruel
one
my
dear
doctor
in
petticoats
was
right
marriage
can
not
rest
upon
passion
as
its
foundation
nor
even
upon
love
how
fine
and
noble
is
your
life
keeping
always
to
the
one
safe
road
you
give
your
husband
an
affection
while
the
passionate
eagerness
with
which
i
threw
myself
into
wedded
life
was
bound
in
nature
to
diminish
twice
have
i
gone
astray
and
twice
has
death
stretched
forth
his
bony
hand
to
strike
my
happiness
the
first
time
he
robbed
me
of
the
noblest
and
most
devoted
of
men
now
it
is
my
turn
the
grinning
monster
tears
me
from
the
arms
of
my
poet
husband
with
all
his
beauty
and
his
grace
yet
i
would
not
complain
have
i
not
known
in
turn
two
men
each
the
very
pattern
of
nobility
one
in
mind
the
other
in
outward
form
in
felipe
the
soul
dominated
and
transformed
the
body
in
gaston
one
could
not
say
which
was
supreme
heart
mind
or
grace
of
form
i
die
adored
what
more
could
i
wish
for
time
perhaps
in
which
to
draw
near
the
god
of
whom
i
may
have
too
little
thought
my
spirit
will
take
its
flight
towards
him
full
of
love
and
with
the
prayer
that
some
day
in
the
world
above
he
will
unite
me
once
more
to
the
two
who
made
a
heaven
of
my
life
below
without
them
paradise
would
be
a
desert
to
me
to
others
my
example
would
be
fatal
for
mine
was
no
common
lot
to
meet
a
felipe
or
a
gaston
is
more
than
mortals
can
expect
and
therefore
the
doctrine
of
society
in
regard
to
marriage
accords
with
the
natural
law
woman
is
weak
and
in
marrying
she
ought
to
make
an
entire
sacrifice
of
her
will
to
the
man
who
in
return
should
lay
his
selfishness
at
her
feet
the
stir
which
women
of
late
years
have
created
by
their
whining
and
insubordination
is
ridiculous
and
only
shows
how
well
we
deserve
the
epithet
of
children
bestowed
by
philosophers
on
our
sex
she
continued
talking
thus
in
the
gentle
voice
you
know
so
well
uttering
the
gravest
truths
in
the
prettiest
manner
until
gaston
entered
bringing
with
him
his
the
two
children
and
the
english
nurse
whom
at
louise
request
he
had
been
to
fetch
from
paris
here
are
the
pretty
instruments
of
my
torture
she
said
as
her
nephews
approached
was
not
the
mistake
excusable
what
a
wonderful
likeness
to
their
uncle
she
was
most
friendly
to
mme
gaston
the
elder
and
begged
that
she
would
look
upon
the
chalet
as
her
home
in
short
she
played
the
hostess
to
her
in
her
best
de
chaulieu
manner
in
which
no
one
can
rival
her
i
wrote
at
once
to
the
duc
and
duchesse
de
chaulieu
the
duc
de
rhetore
and
the
duc
de
as
well
as
to
madeleine
it
was
time
next
day
louise
worn
out
with
so
much
exertion
was
unable
to
go
out
indeed
she
only
got
up
for
dinner
in
the
course
of
the
evening
madeleine
de
lenoncourt
her
two
brothers
and
her
mother
arrived
the
coolness
which
louise
second
marriage
had
caused
between
herself
and
her
family
disappeared
every
day
since
that
evening
louise
father
and
both
her
brothers
have
ridden
over
in
the
morning
and
the
two
duchesses
spend
all
their
evenings
at
the
chalet
death
unites
as
well
as
separates
it
silences
all
paltry
feeling
louise
is
perfection
in
her
charm
her
grace
her
good
sense
her
wit
and
her
tenderness
she
has
retained
to
the
last
that
perfect
tact
for
which
she
has
been
so
famous
and
she
lavishes
on
us
the
treasures
of
her
brilliant
mind
which
made
her
one
of
the
queens
of
paris
i
should
like
to
look
well
even
in
my
coffin
she
said
with
her
matchless
smile
as
she
lay
down
on
the
bed
where
she
was
to
linger
for
a
fortnight
her
room
has
nothing
of
the
in
it
medicines
ointments
the
whole
apparatus
of
nursing
is
carefully
concealed
is
not
my
deathbed
pretty
she
said
to
the
sevres
priest
who
came
to
confess
her
we
gloated
over
her
like
misers
all
this
anxiety
and
the
terrible
truths
which
dawned
on
him
have
prepared
gaston
for
the
worst
he
is
full
of
courage
but
the
blow
has
gone
home
it
would
not
surprise
me
to
see
him
follow
his
wife
in
the
natural
course
yesterday
as
we
were
walking
round
the
lake
he
said
to
me
i
must
be
a
father
to
those
two
children
and
he
pointed
to
his
who
was
taking
the
boys
for
a
walk
but
though
i
shall
do
nothing
to
hasten
my
end
i
want
your
promise
that
you
will
be
a
second
mother
to
them
and
will
persuade
your
husband
to
accept
the
office
of
guardian
which
i
shall
depute
to
him
in
conjunction
with
my
he
said
this
quite
simply
like
a
man
who
knows
he
is
not
long
for
this
world
he
has
smiles
on
his
face
to
meet
louise
and
it
is
only
i
whom
he
does
not
deceive
he
is
a
mate
for
her
in
courage
louise
has
expressed
a
wish
to
see
her
godson
but
i
am
not
sorry
he
should
be
in
provence
she
might
want
to
remember
him
generously
and
i
should
be
in
a
great
difficulty
my
love
august
her
birthday
yesterday
evening
louise
was
delirious
for
a
short
time
but
her
delirium
was
the
prettiest
babbling
which
shows
that
even
the
madness
of
gifted
people
is
not
that
of
fools
or
nobodies
in
a
mere
thread
of
a
voice
she
sang
some
italian
airs
from
puritani
la
sonnambula
while
we
stood
round
the
bed
in
silence
not
one
of
us
not
even
the
duc
de
rhetore
had
dry
eyes
so
clear
was
it
to
us
all
that
her
soul
was
in
this
fashion
passing
from
us
she
could
no
longer
see
us
yet
she
was
there
still
in
the
charm
of
the
faint
melody
with
its
sweetness
not
of
this
earth
during
the
night
the
death
agony
began
it
is
now
seven
in
the
morning
and
i
have
just
myself
raised
her
from
bed
some
flicker
of
strength
revived
she
wished
to
sit
by
her
window
and
asked
for
gaston
hand
and
then
my
love
the
sweetest
spirit
whom
we
shall
ever
see
on
this
earth
departed
leaving
us
the
empty
shell
the
last
sacrament
had
been
administered
the
evening
before
unknown
to
gaston
who
was
taking
a
snatch
of
sleep
during
this
agonizing
ceremony
and
after
she
