the
explorer
preface
to
the
sixth
edition
three
years
have
passed
since
hubbard
and
i
began
that
fateful
journey
into
labrador
of
which
this
volume
is
a
record
a
little
more
than
a
year
has
elapsed
since
the
first
edition
of
our
record
made
its
appearance
from
the
press
meanwhile
i
have
looked
behind
the
ranges
grand
lake
has
again
borne
me
upon
the
bosom
of
her
broad
deep
waters
into
the
great
lonely
wilderness
that
lured
hubbard
to
his
death
it
was
a
day
in
june
last
year
that
found
me
again
at
the
point
where
some
inexplicable
fate
had
led
hubbard
and
me
to
pass
unexplored
the
bay
that
here
extends
northward
to
receive
the
nascaupee
river
along
which
lay
the
trail
for
which
we
were
searching
and
induced
us
to
take
instead
that
other
course
that
carried
us
into
the
dreadful
susan
valley
how
vividly
i
saw
it
all
again
hubbard
resting
on
his
paddle
and
then
rising
up
for
a
better
view
as
he
said
oh
just
a
bay
and
it
is
worth
while
to
take
time
to
explore
it
the
river
comes
in
up
here
at
the
end
of
the
lake
they
all
said
it
was
at
the
end
of
the
lake
and
we
said
yes
it
is
at
the
end
of
the
lake
they
all
said
so
and
went
on
for
that
was
before
we
knew
hubbard
never
knew
a
perceptible
current
a
questioning
word
the
turn
of
a
paddle
would
have
set
us
right
no
current
was
noticed
no
word
was
spoken
and
the
paddle
sent
us
straight
toward
those
blue
hills
yonder
where
suffering
and
starvation
and
death
were
hidden
and
waiting
for
us
how
little
we
expected
to
meet
these
grim
strangers
then
that
july
day
came
back
to
me
as
if
it
had
been
but
the
day
before
i
believe
i
never
missed
hubbard
so
much
as
at
that
moment
i
never
felt
his
loss
so
keenly
as
then
an
almost
irresistible
impulse
seized
me
to
go
on
into
our
old
trail
and
hurry
to
the
camp
where
we
had
left
him
that
stormy
october
day
and
find
if
he
were
not
after
all
still
there
and
waiting
for
me
to
come
back
to
him
reluctantly
i
thrust
the
impulse
aside
armed
with
the
experience
gained
upon
the
former
expedition
and
information
gleaned
from
the
indians
i
turned
into
the
northern
trail
through
the
valley
of
the
nascaupee
and
began
a
journey
that
carried
me
eight
hundred
miles
to
the
shores
of
ungava
bay
and
two
thousand
miles
with
dog
sledge
over
endless
reaches
of
ice
and
snow
while
i
struggled
northward
with
new
companions
hubbard
was
always
with
me
to
inspire
and
urge
me
on
often
and
often
at
night
as
i
sat
disheartened
and
alone
by
the
while
the
rain
beat
down
and
the
wind
soughed
drearily
through
the
firtops
he
would
come
and
sit
by
me
as
of
old
and
as
of
old
i
would
hear
his
gentle
voice
and
his
words
of
encouragement
then
i
would
go
to
my
blankets
with
new
courage
resolved
to
fight
the
battle
to
the
end
one
day
our
camp
was
pitched
upon
the
shores
of
lake
michikamau
and
as
i
looked
for
the
first
time
upon
the
waters
of
the
lake
which
hubbard
had
so
longed
to
reach
i
lived
over
again
that
day
when
he
returned
from
his
climb
to
the
summit
of
the
great
grey
mountain
which
now
bears
his
name
with
the
joyful
news
that
there
just
behind
the
ridge
lay
michikamau
then
the
weary
days
that
followed
and
the
race
down
the
trail
with
all
its
horrors
our
kiss
and
embrace
and
my
final
glimpse
of
the
little
white
tent
in
which
he
lay
and
so
with
the
remembrance
of
his
example
as
an
inspiration
the
work
was
finished
by
me
the
survivor
but
to
hubbard
and
to
his
memory
belong
the
credit
and
the
honour
for
it
was
only
through
my
training
with
him
and
this
inspiration
received
from
him
that
i
was
able
to
carry
to
successful
completion
what
he
had
so
well
planned
my
publishers
inform
me
that
five
editions
of
our
story
have
found
their
way
into
the
hearts
and
homes
of
those
who
can
not
visit
the
great
northern
wilds
but
who
love
to
hear
about
them
i
shall
avail
myself
of
this
opportunity
to
thank
these
readers
for
the
kindly
manner
in
which
they
have
received
the
book
this
reception
of
it
has
been
especially
gratifying
to
me
because
of
the
lack
of
confidence
i
had
in
my
ability
to
tell
the
story
of
hubbard
life
and
glorious
death
as
i
felt
it
should
be
told
the
writing
of
the
story
was
a
work
of
love
i
wished
not
only
to
fulfil
my
last
promise
to
my
friend
to
write
the
narrative
of
his
expedition
but
i
wished
also
to
create
a
sort
of
memorial
to
him
i
wanted
the
world
to
know
hubbard
as
he
was
his
noble
character
his
devotion
to
duty
and
his
faith
so
strong
that
not
even
the
severe
hardships
he
endured
in
the
desolate
north
ending
only
with
death
could
make
him
for
a
moment
forget
the
simple
truths
that
he
learned
from
his
mother
on
the
farm
in
old
michigan
i
wanted
the
young
men
to
know
these
things
for
they
could
not
fail
to
be
the
better
for
having
learned
them
and
i
wanted
the
mothers
to
know
what
men
mothers
can
make
of
their
sons
an
unknown
friend
writes
me
to
dare
and
die
so
divinely
and
leave
such
a
record
is
to
be
transfigured
on
a
mountain
top
a
master
symbol
to
all
men
of
human
victory
by
reverence
and
peace
a
gospel
of
nobleness
and
faith
and
another
how
truly
moves
in
a
mysterious
way
his
wonders
to
perform
hubbard
went
to
find
lake
michikamau
he
failed
but
god
spelled
of
and
you
brought
back
a
message
which
should
be
an
inspiration
to
every
soul
to
whom
it
comes
the
life
given
up
in
the
wilds
of
labrador
was
not
in
vain
space
will
not
permit
me
to
quote
further
from
the
many
letters
of
this
kind
that
have
come
to
me
from
all
over
the
united
states
and
canada
but
they
tell
me
that
others
have
learned
to
know
hubbard
as
he
was
and
as
his
friends
knew
him
and
that
our
book
has
not
failed
of
its
purpose
the
storms
of
two
winters
have
held
in
their
icy
grasp
the
bleak
land
in
which
he
yielded
up
his
life
for
a
principle
and
the
flowers
of
two
summers
have
blossomed
upon
his
grave
overlooking
the
hudson
but
it
was
only
his
body
that
we
buried
there
his
spirit
still
lives
for
his
was
a
spirit
too
big
and
noble
to
be
bound
by
the
narrow
confines
of
a
grave
his
life
is
an
example
of
religious
faith
strong
principle
and
daring
bravery
that
will
not
be
forgotten
by
the
young
men
of
our
land

preface
to
eleventh
edition
as
the
eleventh
edition
of
this
book
goes
to
press
the
opportunity
is
given
for
a
brief
prefatory
description
of
a
pilgrimage
to
in
the
labrador
wilderness
from
which
i
have
just
returned
for
many
years
it
had
been
my
wish
to
the
scene
of
those
tragic
experiences
and
to
permanently
and
appropriately
mark
the
spot
where
hubbard
so
heroically
gave
up
his
life
a
decade
ago
judge
william
malone
of
bristol
connecticut
one
of
the
many
men
who
have
received
inspiration
from
hubbard
noble
example
was
my
companion
and
at
northwest
river
we
were
joined
by
gilbert
blake
who
was
a
member
of
the
party
of
four
trappers
who
rescued
me
in
we
carried
with
us
a
beautiful
bronze
tablet
which
was
designed
to
be
placed
upon
the
boulder
before
which
hubbard
tent
was
pitched
when
he
died
wrapped
with
the
tablet
was
a
little
silk
flag
and
college
pennant
lovingly
contributed
by
his
sister
arthur
williams
of
detroit
michigan
these
were
to
be
draped
upon
the
tablet
when
erected
and
left
with
it
in
the
wilderness
our
plan
was
to
ascend
and
explore
the
lower
beaver
river
to
the
point
where
hubbard
discovered
it
and
where
in
we
abandoned
our
canoe
to
to
the
susan
river
valley
a
few
days
before
his
death
here
it
was
our
expectation
to
follow
the
old
hubbard
portage
trail
to
goose
creek
and
thence
down
goose
creek
to
the
susan
river
of
our
journey
up
the
beaver
river
suffice
it
to
say
that
we
met
with
many
adventures
but
proceeded
without
serious
accident
until
one
day
our
canoe
was
submerged
in
heavy
rapids
the
lashings
gave
way
and
to
our
consternation
the
precious
tablet
together
with
the
flag
and
pennant
was
lost
in
the
flood
after
two
days
vain
effort
to
recover
the
tablet
and
flags
we
continued
on
the
river
until
at
length
further
ascent
seemed
unpractical
from
this
point
with
packs
on
our
backs
we
made
a
difficult
foot
journey
of
several
days
to
the
susan
river
valley
i
shall
not
attempt
to
describe
my
feelings
when
at
last
we
came
into
the
valley
where
hubbard
died
and
where
we
had
suffered
so
much
man
changes
with
the
fleeting
years
and
a
civilized
world
changes
but
the
untrod
wilderness
never
changes
before
us
lay
the
same
rushing
river
i
remembered
so
well
the
same
starved
forest
of
spruce
with
its
pungent
odor
and
there
was
the
clump
of
spruce
trees
in
which
our
last
camp
was
pitched
just
as
i
had
seen
it
last
malone
and
blake
remained
by
the
river
bank
while
i
approached
alone
what
to
me
was
sacred
ground
time
fell
away
and
i
believe
that
i
expected
when
i
stepped
beside
the
boulder
before
which
his
tent
was
pitched
when
we
said
our
last
farewell
on
that
dismal
october
morning
ten
years
ago
to
hear
hubbard
voice
welcome
me
as
of
old
the
charred
wood
of
his
camp
fire
might
from
all
appearances
have
but
just
grown
cold
the
boughs
which
i
had
broken
and
arranged
for
his
couch
and
upon
which
he
slept
and
died
were
withered
but
undisturbed
and
i
could
identify
exactly
the
spot
where
he
lay
there
were
his
worn
old
moccasins
and
one
of
the
leather
mittens
which
in
his
last
entry
in
his
diary
he
said
he
might
eat
if
need
be
near
the
dead
fire
were
some
spoons
and
other
small
articles
as
we
had
left
them
and
scattered
about
were
remnants
of
our
tent
lovingly
we
put
ourselves
to
our
task
judge
malone
with
a
brush
improvised
from
blake
stiff
hair
and
with
white
lead
intended
for
canoe
repairs
lettered
upon
the
boulder
this
inscription
leonidas
hubbard
intrepid
explorer
and
practical
christian
died
here
whither
i
go
ye
know
and
the
way
ye
know
john
then
with
hammer
and
chisel
i
cut
the
inscription
deep
into
the
rock
and
we
filled
the
letters
with
white
lead
to
counteract
the
effect
of
the
elements
it
was
dark
when
the
work
was
finished
and
by
candlelight
beneath
the
stars
i
read
from
the
same
testament
i
used
in
the
fourteenth
of
john
and
the
thirteenth
of
first
corinthians
the
chapters
which
i
read
to
hubbard
on
the
morning
of
our
parting
judge
malone
read
the
fiftieth
psalm
we
sang
some
hymns
and
then
knelt
about
the
withered
couch
of
boughs
each
of
us
three
with
the
feeling
that
hubbard
was
very
close
to
us
in
early
morning
we
shouldered
our
packs
again
and
with
a
final
look
at
hubbard

the
lure
of
the
labrador
wild
i
the
object
of
the
expedition
how
would
you
like
to
go
to
labrador
wallace
it
was
a
snowy
night
in
late
november
that
my
friend
leonidas
hubbard
asked
me
this
question
all
day
he
and
i
had
been
tramping
through
the
snow
among
the
shawangunk
mountains
in
southern
new
york
and
when
the
shades
of
evening
fell
we
had
built
a
of
boughs
to
shelter
us
from
the
storm
now
that
we
had
eaten
our
supper
of
bread
and
bacon
washed
down
with
tea
we
lay
before
our
roaring
campfire
luxuriating
in
its
glow
and
warmth
hubbard
question
was
put
to
me
so
abruptly
that
it
rather
startled
me
labrador
i
exclaimed
now
where
in
the
world
is
labrador
of
course
i
knew
it
was
somewhere
in
the
part
of
the
continent
but
so
many
years
had
passed
since
i
laid
away
my
old
school
geography
that
its
exact
situation
had
escaped
my
memory
and
the
only
other
knowledge
i
had
retained
of
the
country
was
a
confused
sense
of
its
being
a
sort
of
arctic
wilderness
hubbard
proceeded
to
enlighten
me
by
tracing
with
his
pencil
on
the
of
his
notebook
an
outline
map
of
the
peninsula
very
interesting
i
commented
but
why
do
you
wish
to
go
there
man
he
replied
do
you
realise
it
about
the
only
part
of
the
continent
that
has
been
explored
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
much
more
known
of
the
interior
of
labrador
now
than
when
cabot
discovered
the
coast
more
than
four
hundred
years
ago
he
jumped
up
to
throw
more
wood
on
the
fire
think
of
it
wallace
he
went
on
a
great
unknown
land
right
near
home
as
wild
and
primitive
as
it
has
always
been
i
want
to
see
it
i
want
to
get
into
a
really
wild
country
and
have
some
of
the
experiences
of
the
old
fellows
who
explored
and
opened
up
the
country
where
we
are
now
resuming
his
place
by
the
blazing
logs
hubbard
unfolded
to
me
his
plan
then
vague
and
in
the
rough
of
exploring
a
part
of
the
unknown
eastern
end
of
the
peninsula
of
trips
such
as
this
he
had
been
dreaming
since
childhood
when
a
mere
boy
on
his
father
farm
in
michigan
he
had
lain
for
hours
out
under
the
trees
in
the
orchard
poring
over
a
map
of
canada
and
making
imaginary
journeys
into
the
unexplored
boone
and
crockett
were
his
heroes
and
sometimes
he
was
so
affected
by
the
tales
of
their
adventures
that
he
must
needs
himself
steal
away
to
the
woods
and
camp
out
for
two
or
three
days
it
was
at
this
period
that
he
resolved
to
head
some
day
an
exploring
expedition
of
his
own
and
this
resolution
he
forgot
neither
while
a
student
nor
while
serving
as
a
newspaper
man
in
detroit
and
new
york
at
length
through
a
connection
he
made
with
a
magazine
devoted
to
life
he
was
able
to
make
several
long
trips
into
the
wild
among
other
places
he
visited
the
hudson
bay
region
and
once
penetrated
to
the
winter
hunting
ground
of
the
mountaineer
indians
north
of
lake
john
in
southern
labrador
these
trips
however
failed
to
satisfy
him
his
ambition
was
to
reach
a
region
where
no
white
man
had
preceded
him
now
at
the
age
of
he
believed
that
his
ambition
was
about
to
be
realised
it
always
the
way
wallace
he
said
when
a
fellow
starts
on
a
long
trail
he
never
willing
to
quit
it
be
the
same
with
you
if
you
go
with
me
to
labrador
you
say
each
trip
will
be
the
last
but
when
you
come
home
you
hear
the
voice
of
the
wilderness
calling
you
to
return
and
it
will
lure
you
away
again
and
again
i
thought
my
lake
john
trip
was
something
but
while
there
i
stood
at
the
portals
of
the
unknown
and
it
brought
back
stronger
than
ever
the
old
longing
to
make
discoveries
so
that
now
the
walls
of
the
city
seem
to
me
a
prison
and
i
simply
must
get
away
my
friend
enthusiasm
was
contagious
it
had
never
previously
occurred
to
me
to
undertake
the
game
of
exploration
but
like
most
american
boys
i
had
had
youthful
dreams
of
going
into
a
great
wild
country
even
as
my
forefathers
had
gone
and
hubbard
talk
brought
back
the
old
juvenile
love
of
adventure
that
night
before
we
lay
down
to
sleep
i
said
hubbard
i
go
with
you
and
so
the
thing
was
settled
that
was
how
hubbard
expedition
had
its
birth
more
than
a
year
passed
however
before
hubbard
was
able
to
make
definite
arrangements
to
get
away
i
believe
it
was
in
february
that
the
telephone
bell
in
my
law
office
rang
and
hubbard
voice
at
the
other
end
of
the
wire
conveyed
to
me
the
information
that
he
had
bully
news
is
that
so
i
said
what
up
the
labrador
trip
is
all
fixed
for
this
summer
was
the
excited
reply
come
out
to
congers
without
fail
and
we
talk
it
over
in
accordance
with
his
invitation
i
went
out
that
evening
to
visit
my
friend
in
his
suburban
home
i
shall
never
forget
the
exuberance
of
his
joy
you
would
have
thought
he
was
a
boy
about
to
be
released
from
school
by
this
time
he
had
become
the
associate
editor
of
the
magazine
for
which
he
had
been
writing
but
he
had
finally
been
able
to
induce
his
employers
to
consent
to
the
project
upon
which
he
had
set
his
heart
and
grant
him
a
leave
of
absence
it
will
be
a
big
thing
wallace
he
said
in
closing
it
ought
to
make
my
reputation
into
the
project
of
penetrating
the
vast
solitudes
of
desolate
labrador
over
which
still
brooded
the
fascinating
twilight
of
the
mysterious
unknown
hubbard
with
characteristic
zeal
threw
his
whole
heart
and
soul
systematically
and
thoroughly
he
went
about
planning
in
the
minutest
detail
our
outfit
and
entire
journey
every
possible
contingency
received
the
most
careful
consideration
in
order
to
make
plain
just
what
he
hoped
to
accomplish
and
the
conditions
against
which
he
had
to
provide
the
reader
patience
is
asked
for
a
few
minutes
while
something
is
told
of
what
was
known
of
labrador
at
the
time
hubbard
was
making
preparations
for
his
expedition
the
interior
of
the
peninsula
of
labrador
is
a
rolling
plateau
the
land
rising
more
or
less
abruptly
from
the
coast
to
a
height
of
two
thousand
or
more
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
scattered
over
this
plateau
are
numerous
lakes
and
marshes
the
rivers
and
streams
discharging
the
waters
of
the
lakes
into
the
sea
flow
to
the
four
points
of
the
compass
into
the
atlantic
and
its
inlets
on
the
east
into
ungava
bay
on
the
north
hudson
bay
and
james
bay
on
the
west
and
the
gulf
of
lawrence
on
the
south
owing
to
the
abrupt
rise
of
the
land
from
the
coast
these
rivers
and
streams
are
very
swift
and
are
filled
with
a
constant
succession
of
falls
and
rapids
consequently
their
navigation
in
canoes
the
only
possible
way
generally
speaking
to
navigate
them
is
most
difficult
and
dangerous
in
this
to
a
large
extent
lies
the
explanation
as
to
why
only
a
few
daring
white
men
have
ever
penetrated
to
the
interior
plateau
the
condition
of
the
rivers
if
nothing
else
makes
it
impossible
to
transport
sufficient
food
to
sustain
a
party
for
any
considerable
period
and
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
run
the
risk
of
obtaining
supplies
from
a
country
that
may
be
plentiful
with
game
one
year
and
destitute
of
it
the
next
and
in
which
the
vegetation
is
the
scantiest
the
western
part
of
the
peninsula
although
it
too
contains
vast
tracts
in
which
no
white
man
has
set
foot
is
somewhat
better
known
than
the
eastern
most
of
the
rivers
that
flow
into
hudson
and
james
bays
having
been
explored
and
correctly
mapped
hubbard
objective
was
the
eastern
and
northern
part
of
the
peninsula
and
it
is
with
this
section
that
we
shall
hereafter
deal
such
parts
of
this
territory
as
might
be
called
settled
lie
in
the
region
of
hamilton
inlet
and
along
the
coast
hamilton
inlet
is
an
arm
of
the
atlantic
extending
inland
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
in
a
southwesterly
direction
at
its
entrance
which
is
two
hundred
miles
north
of
cape
charles
the
inlet
is
some
forty
miles
wide
fifty
miles
inland
from
the
settlement
of
indian
harbour
which
is
situated
on
one
of
the
white
bear
islands
near
the
north
coast
of
the
inlet
at
its
entrance
is
the
rigolet
post
of
the
hudson
bay
company
the
old
company
as
its
agents
love
to
call
it
and
here
the
inlet
narrows
down
to
a
mere
channel
but
during
the
next
eighty
miles
of
its
course
inland
it
again
widens
this
section
of
it
being
known
as
groswater
bay
or
lake
melville
the
extreme
western
end
of
the
inlet
is
called
goose
bay
into
this
bay
flows
the
grand
or
hamilton
river
one
of
the
largest
in
labrador
from
its
source
among
the
lakes
on
the
interior
plateau
the
grand
river
first
sweeps
down
in
a
southeasterly
direction
and
then
bends
northeasterly
to
reach
the
end
of
hamilton
inlet
the
tributaries
of
the
lakes
forming
the
headwaters
of
the
grand
river
connect
it
indirectly
with
lake
michikamau
big
water
this
the
largest
lake
in
eastern
labrador
is
between
eighty
and
ninety
miles
in
length
with
a
width
varying
from
six
to
miles
the
grand
river
as
well
as
a
portion
of
lake
michikamau
some
years
ago
was
explored
and
correctly
mapped
but
the
other
rivers
that
flow
to
the
eastward
have
either
been
mapped
only
from
hearsay
or
not
at
all
of
the
several
rivers
flowing
into
ungava
bay
the
koksoak
alone
has
been
explored
this
river
which
is
the
largest
of
those
flowing
north
rises
in
lakes
to
the
westward
of
lake
michikamau
next
to
the
koksoak
the
george
is
the
best
known
of
the
rivers
emptying
into
ungava
bay
as
well
as
the
second
largest
but
while
it
has
been
learned
that
its
source
is
among
the
lakes
to
the
northward
of
michikamau
it
has
been
mapped
only
from
hearsay
now
if
the
reader
will
turn
to
the
accompanying
map
of
labrador
made
by
low
of
the
canadian
geological
survey
he
will
see
that
the
body
of
water
known
as
grand
lake
is
represented
thereon
merely
as
the
widening
out
of
a
large
river
called
the
northwest
which
flows
from
lake
michikamau
to
groswater
bay
or
hamilton
inlet
after
being
joined
about
twenty
miles
above
grand
lake
by
a
river
called
the
nascaupee
relying
upon
this
map
hubbard
planned
to
reach
early
in
the
summer
the
northwest
river
post
of
the
hudson
bay
company
which
is
situated
at
the
mouth
of
the
northwest
river
ascend
the
river
to
lake
michikamau
and
then
from
the
northern
end
of
that
lake
beat
across
the
country
to
the
george
river
the
geological
survey
map
is
the
best
of
labrador
extant
but
its
representation
as
to
the
northwest
river
made
from
hearsay
proved
to
be
wholly
incorrect
and
the
mistake
it
led
us
into
cost
us
dear
after
the
rescue
i
thoroughly
explored
grand
lake
and
as
will
be
seen
from
my
map
i
discovered
that
no
less
than
five
rivers
flow
into
it
which
are
known
to
the
natives
as
the
nascaupee
the
beaver
the
susan
the
crooked
and
the
cape
corbeau
the
nascaupee
is
the
largest
and
as
the
inquiries
i
made
among
the
indians
satisfied
me
that
it
is
the
outlet
of
lake
michikamau
it
is
undoubtedly
the
river
that
figures
on
the
geological
survey
map
as
the
northwest
while
as
for
the
river
called
on
the
map
the
nascaupee
it
is
in
all
likelihood
there
is
a
stream
known
to
the
natives
as
northwest
river
but
it
is
merely
the
strait
one
hundred
yards
wide
and
three
hundred
yards
long
which
as
shown
on
my
map
connects
groswater
bay
with
what
the
natives
call
the
little
lake
this
being
the
small
body
of
water
that
lies
at
the
lower
end
of
grand
lake
the
waters
of
which
it
receives
through
a
rapid
hubbard
hoped
to
reach
the
george
river
in
season
to
meet
the
nenenot
or
nascaupee
indians
who
according
to
an
old
tradition
gather
on
its
banks
in
late
august
or
early
september
to
attack
with
spears
the
herds
of
caribou
that
migrate
at
that
time
passing
eastward
to
the
sea
coast
it
is
reported
that
while
the
caribou
are
swimming
the
river
the
indians
each
year
kill
great
numbers
of
them
drying
the
flesh
for
winter
provisions
and
using
the
skins
to
make
clothing
and
hubbard
wished
not
only
to
get
a
good
story
of
the
yearly
slaughter
but
to
spend
some
little
time
studying
the
habits
of
the
indians
who
are
the
most
primitive
on
the
north
american
continent
strange
as
it
may
seem
to
some
the
temperature
in
the
interior
of
labrador
in
midsummer
sometimes
rises
as
high
as
degrees
or
more
although
at
sunset
it
almost
invariably
drops
to
near
the
freezing
point
and
frost
is
liable
at
any
time
but
the
summer
of
course
is
very
short
it
may
be
said
to
begin
early
in
july
by
which
time
the
snow
and
ice
are
all
gone
and
to
end
late
in
august
there
is
just
a
hint
of
spring
and
autumn
winter
glides
into
summer
and
summer
into
winter
almost
imperceptibly
and
the
winter
is
the
bitter
winter
of
the
arctic
if
the
season
were
not
too
far
advanced
when
he
finished
studying
the
indians
hubbard
expected
to
cross
the
country
to
the
lawrence
and
civilisation
otherwise
to
retrace
his
steps
over
his
upward
trail
in
the
event
of
our
failure
to
discover
the
indian
encampment
and
our
finding
ourselves
on
the
george
short
of
provisions
hubbard
planned
to
run
down
the
river
in
our
canoe
to
the
george
river
post
at
its
mouth
and
there
procure
passage
on
some
fishing
vessel
for
newfoundland
or
if
that
were
impossible
to
outfit
for
winter
and
when
the
ice
formed
and
the
snow
came
return
overland
with
dogs
hubbard
knew
that
by
ascending
the
grand
river
he
would
be
taking
a
surer
if
longer
route
to
lake
michikamau
but
it
was
a
part
of
his
project
to
explore
the
unknown
country
along
the
river
mapped
as
the
northwest
i
have
called
this
country
unknown
it
is
true
that
in
the
winter
of
john
mclean
then
the
agent
of
the
hudson
bay
company
at
fort
chimo
a
post
situated
on
the
koksoak
river
about
twenty
miles
above
its
mouth
passed
through
a
portion
of
this
country
in
the
course
of
a
journey
he
made
with
dogs
from
his
post
to
northwest
river
post
his
route
was
up
the
koksoak
and
across
country
to
the
northern
end
of
lake
michikamau
which
he
followed
for
some
little
distance
after
leaving
the
lake
he
again
travelled
eastward
across
country
until
at
length
he
came
upon
the
northwest
or
nascaupee
river
at
a
point
probably
not
far
above
grand
lake
from
which
it
was
easy
travelling
over
the
ice
to
the
post
the
record
left
by
him
of
the
journey
however
is
very
incomplete
and
the
exact
route
he
took
is
by
no
means
certain
whatever
route
it
was
he
returned
over
it
the
same
winter
to
fort
chimo
his
sufferings
during
this
trip
were
extreme
he
and
his
party
had
to
eat
their
dogs
to
save
themselves
from
starvation
and
even
then
they
would
surely
all
have
perished
had
it
not
been
for
an
indian
who
left
the
party
fifty
miles
out
of
chimo
and
fortunately
had
strength
enough
to
reach
the
post
and
send
back
relief
later
mclean
made
several
summer
trips
with
a
canoe
up
the
george
river
from
ungava
bay
and
down
the
grand
river
to
hamilton
inlet
but
never
again
did
he
attempt
to
penetrate
the
country
lying
between
lake
michikamau
and
hamilton
inlet
to
the
north
of
grand
river
the
fact
was
that
he
found
his
grand
river
trips
bad
enough
the
record
he
has
left
of
them
is
a
story
of
a
continuous
struggle
against
heartbreaking
hardships
and
of
narrow
escapes
from
starvation
it
is
asserted
that
a
priest
once
crossed
with
the
indians
from
northwest
river
post
to
ungava
bay
by
the
nascaupee
route
but
the
result
of
my
inquiries
in
labrador
convinced
me
that
the
priest
in
question
travelled
by
way
of
the
grand
river
making
it
certain
that
previous
to
hubbard
expedition
no
white
man
other
than
mclean
had
ever
crossed
the
wilderness
between
hamilton
inlet
and
lake
michikamau
by
any
route
other
than
the
aforesaid
grand
river
as
has
been
pointed
out
mclean
made
but
a
very
incomplete
record
of
his
journey
that
took
him
through
the
country
north
of
the
grand
river
so
that
project
called
for
his
plunge
into
a
region
where
no
footsteps
would
be
found
to
guide
him
not
only
this
but
the
george
river
country
which
it
was
his
ultimate
purpose
to
reach
was
and
still
remains
terra
incognita
for
although
mclean
made
several
trips
up
and
down
this
river
he
neither
mapped
it
nor
left
any
definite
descriptions
concerning
it
here
then
was
an
enterprise
fully
worthy
of
an
ambitious
and
venturesome
spirit
like
hubbard
here
was
a
great
unknown
wilderness
into
which
even
the
native
trappers
who
lived
on
its
outskirts
were
afraid
to
penetrate
knowing
that
the
wandering
bands
of
indians
who
occasionally
traversed
its
fastnesses
themselves
frequently
starved
to
death
in
that
inhospitable
barren
country
there
was
danger
to
be
faced
and
good
copy
to
be
obtained
and
so
it
was
ho
for
the
land
of
bared
boughs
and
grieving
winds
ii
off
at
last
labrador
uncertain
game
supply
presented
more
than
one
vexed
problem
for
hubbard
to
solve
naturally
it
would
be
desirable
to
take
with
us
sufficient
provisions
to
guard
against
all
contingencies
but
such
were
the
conditions
of
the
country
for
which
we
were
bound
that
if
the
expedition
were
at
all
heavily
loaded
it
would
be
impossible
for
it
to
make
any
headway
hubbard
therefore
decided
to
travel
light
then
arose
the
question
as
to
how
many
men
to
take
with
us
if
the
party
were
large
that
is
up
to
a
certain
limit
more
food
might
possibly
be
carried
for
each
member
than
if
the
party
were
small
but
if
game
proved
plentiful
there
would
be
no
danger
from
starvation
whether
the
party
were
large
or
small
for
then
short
stops
could
be
made
to
kill
animals
dry
the
flesh
and
make
caches
after
the
manner
of
the
indians
as
supply
bases
to
fall
back
upon
should
we
be
overtaken
by
an
early
winter
and
if
the
game
should
prove
scarce
a
small
party
could
kill
on
a
forced
march
nearly
if
not
quite
as
much
as
a
large
party
and
requiring
a
proportionately
smaller
amount
of
food
to
maintain
it
would
consequently
have
a
better
chance
of
success
taking
all
things
into
consideration
hubbard
decided
that
the
party
should
be
small
to
guard
against
possible
disappointment
in
the
way
of
getting
men
hubbard
wrote
to
the
agent
of
the
hudson
bay
company
at
rigolet
asking
whether
any
could
be
obtained
for
a
trip
into
the
interior
either
at
that
post
or
at
northwest
river
the
agent
replied
that
such
a
thing
was
highly
improbable
as
the
visits
of
the
indians
to
these
posts
had
become
infrequent
and
the
other
natives
were
afraid
to
venture
far
inland
hubbard
then
engaged
through
the
kind
offices
of
a
king
who
was
in
charge
of
the
hudson
bay
company
post
at
missanabie
ontario
the
services
of
a
cree
indian
named
jerry
that
we
might
have
at
least
one
man
upon
whom
we
could
depend
jerry
was
to
have
come
on
to
new
york
city
to
meet
us
at
next
to
the
last
moment
however
a
letter
from
king
informed
us
that
jerry
had
backed
down
the
indian
was
not
afraid
of
labrador
it
appeared
but
he
had
heard
of
the
dangers
and
pitfalls
of
new
york
and
when
he
learned
that
he
should
have
to
pass
through
that
city
his
courage
failed
him
he
positively
refused
to
come
saying
he
did
not
want
to
die
so
soon
we
never
had
occasion
to
regret
jerry
king
engaged
for
us
another
man
who
he
wrote
was
an
expert
canoeman
and
woodsman
and
a
good
cook
the
man
proved
to
be
all
that
he
was
represented
to
be
and
more
i
do
not
believe
that
in
all
the
north
country
we
could
have
found
a
better
woodsman
but
he
was
something
more
than
a
woodsman
he
was
a
hero
under
the
most
trying
circumstances
he
was
calm
cheerful
companionable
faithful
not
only
did
he
turn
out
to
be
a
man
of
intelligence
quick
of
perception
and
resourceful
but
he
turned
out
to
be
a
man
of
character
and
i
am
proud
to
introduce
him
to
the
reader
as
my
friend
george
elson
a
cree
indian
from
down
on
james
bay
the
first
instance
of
george
resourcefulness
that
we
noted
occurred
upon
his
arrival
in
new
york
hubbard
and
i
were
to
have
taken
him
in
charge
at
the
grand
central
station
but
we
were
detained
and
george
found
no
one
to
meet
him
despite
the
fact
that
he
had
never
been
in
a
city
before
and
all
was
new
to
him
his
quick
eye
discovered
that
the
long
line
of
cabs
in
front
of
the
station
were
there
to
hire
he
promptly
engaged
one
was
driven
to
hubbard
office
and
awaited
his
employer
arrival
as
calm
and
unruffled
as
though
his
surroundings
were
perfectly
familiar
our
canoe
and
our
entire
outfit
were
purchased
in
new
york
with
the
exception
of
a
gill
net
which
alas
we
decided
to
defer
selecting
until
we
reached
labrador
our
preparations
for
the
expedition
were
made
with
a
view
of
sailing
from
johns
newfoundland
for
rigolet
when
the
steamer
virginia
lake
which
regularly
plies
during
the
summer
between
the
former
port
and
points
on
the
labrador
coast
should
make
her
first
trip
north
of
the
year
a
letter
from
the
company
which
operates
the
steamer
informed
us
that
she
would
probably
make
her
first
trip
to
labrador
in
the
last
week
in
june
and
in
order
to
connect
with
her
we
made
arrangements
to
sail
from
new
york
to
johns
on
june
on
the
red
cross
line
steamer
silvia
on
the
hubbard
personally
superintended
the
placing
of
our
outfit
on
board
ship
that
nothing
might
be
overlooked
as
the
silvia
slowly
got
under
way
at
ten
the
next
morning
we
waved
a
last
farewell
to
the
little
knot
of
friends
who
had
gathered
on
the
brooklyn
pier
to
see
us
off
we
were
all
very
and
gay
that
morning
it
was
a
relief
to
be
off
at
last
and
have
the
worry
of
the
preparation
over
hubbard
was
a
member
of
the
party
she
was
to
accompany
her
husband
as
far
as
battle
harbour
the
first
point
on
the
labrador
coast
touched
by
the
virginia
lake
june
was
my
birthday
and
early
that
morning
before
we
sailed
from
halifax
at
which
port
we
lay
over
for
a
day
hubbard
came
into
my
stateroom
with
a
pair
of
camp
blankets
that
he
had
been
commissioned
by
my
sisters
to
present
to
me
he
had
told
me
he
had
enough
blankets
in
his
outfit
and
to
take
none
with
me
how
strangely
things
sometimes
turn
out
those
blankets
which
hubbard
had
withheld
in
order
that
i
might
be
agreeably
surprised
were
destined
to
fulfil
an
office
up
there
in
the
wilds
for
which
we
were
bound
such
as
we
little
suspected
we
reached
johns
on
the
morning
of
friday
the
and
promptly
upon
our
arrival
were
introduced
to
the
mysterious
ways
of
the
company
the
virginia
lake
we
were
told
already
had
gone
north
to
labrador
was
overdue
on
her
return
trip
and
might
not
be
in
for
several
days
hubbard
however
set
immediately
to
work
purchasing
the
provisions
for
his
expedition
and
supervising
their
packing
the
following
day
on
the
advice
of
the
general
passenger
agent
of
the
company
we
took
the
evening
train
on
their
little
railroad
to
whitbourne
en
route
to
broad
cove
where
we
were
informed
we
should
find
excellent
trout
fishing
and
could
pleasantly
pass
the
time
while
awaiting
the
steamer
the
company
failed
to
carry
out
its
agreement
as
to
our
transportation
to
broad
cove
and
we
had
considerable
trouble
in
reaching
there
but
we
found
that
no
misrepresentation
had
been
made
as
to
the
fishing
during
the
two
days
we
were
at
broad
cove
we
caught
all
the
trout
we
cared
for
having
received
word
that
the
virginia
lake
had
returned
to
johns
and
would
again
sail
north
on
tuesday
june
hubbard
and
hubbard
on
the
morning
of
that
day
took
the
train
to
johns
to
board
the
steamer
there
and
see
that
nothing
of
our
outfit
was
left
behind
george
and
i
broke
camp
in
time
to
take
the
evening
train
on
the
branch
road
to
harbour
grace
where
it
was
agreed
we
should
rejoin
the
others
the
steamer
being
scheduled
to
put
in
there
on
its
way
north
when
i
had
our
camp
baggage
transferred
next
morning
to
the
wharf
and
george
and
i
had
arrived
there
ourselves
we
found
also
waiting
for
the
steamer
several
prospectors
who
were
going
to
the
labrador
as
the
country
is
known
to
the
newfoundlanders
to
look
for
gold
copper
and
mica
all
of
them
apparently
were
dreaming
of
fabulous
wealth
none
i
was
told
was
going
farther
than
the
lower
coast
they
did
not
attempt
to
disguise
the
fact
that
they
feared
to
venture
far
into
the
interior
around
the
wharves
little
boats
were
unloading
caplin
a
small
fish
about
the
size
of
a
smelt
i
was
informed
that
these
fish
sold
for
ten
cents
a
barrel
and
were
used
for
bait
and
fertiliser
my
astonishment
may
be
imagined
therefore
when
i
discovered
that
on
the
virginia
lake
they
charged
cents
for
three
of
these
little
fish
fried
at
ten
our
boat
came
in
and
a
little
after
noon
we
steamed
out
of
the
harbour
hubbard
and
i
feeling
that
now
we
were
fairly
on
our
way
to
the
scene
of
our
work
soon
after
rejoining
hubbard
i
learned
something
more
of
the
mysterious
ways
of
the
company
the
company
general
passenger
agent
avowing
deep
interest
in
our
enterprise
had
presented
hubbard
with
passes
to
rigolet
for
his
party
hubbard
accepted
them
gratefully
but
upon
boarding
the
steamer
he
was
informed
that
the
passes
did
not
include
meals
now
such
were
the
prices
charged
for
the
food
served
on
the
virginia
lake
that
a
moderately
hungry
man
could
scarcely
have
his
appetite
killed
at
a
less
expense
than
six
dollars
a
day
so
hubbard
returned
the
passes
to
the
general
passenger
agent
with
thanks
and
purchased
tickets
which
did
include
meals
and
which
reduced
the
cost
considerably
the
virginia
lake
is
a
steamer
of
some
seven
hundred
tons
burden
she
is
subsidised
by
the
newfoundland
government
to
carry
the
mails
during
the
fishing
season
to
points
on
the
labrador
coast
as
far
north
as
nain
she
is
also
one
of
the
sealing
fleet
that
goes
to
the
ice
each
tenth
of
march
when
she
brings
back
her
cargo
of
seals
to
johns
she
takes
up
her
summer
work
of
carrying
mail
passengers
and
freight
to
the
labrador
always
a
welcome
visitor
to
the
exiled
fishermen
in
that
lonely
land
the
one
link
that
binds
them
to
home
and
the
outside
world
she
has
on
board
a
physician
to
set
broken
bones
and
deal
out
drugs
to
the
sick
and
a
customs
officer
to
see
that
not
a
dime
worth
of
merchandise
of
any
kind
or
nature
is
landed
until
a
good
round
percentage
of
duty
is
paid
to
him
as
the
representative
of
the
newfoundland
government
which
holds
dominion
over
all
the
east
coast
of
labrador
this
customs
officer
is
also
a
magistrate
a
secret
service
officer
a
constable
and
what
not
i
do
not
know
pretty
much
the
whole
labrador
government
i
imagine
the
accommodations
on
the
virginia
lake
were
quite
inadequate
for
the
number
of
passengers
she
carried
the
stuffy
little
saloon
was
so
crowded
that
comfort
was
out
of
the
question
i
had
to
use
some
rather
impressive
language
to
the
steward
to
induce
him
to
assign
to
me
a
stateroom
finally
he
surrendered
his
own
room
the
ventilation
was
poor
and
the
atmosphere
vile
but
we
managed
to
pull
through
our
were
all
either
prospectors
or
owners
of
fishing
schooners
there
was
much
ice
to
be
seen
when
the
heavy
veil
of
grey
fog
lifted
sufficiently
for
us
to
see
anything
and
until
we
had
crossed
the
strait
of
belle
isle
our
passage
was
a
rough
one
it
was
on
the
fourth
of
july
that
we
saw
for
the
first
time
the
bleak
coast
of
labrador
in
all
the
earth
there
is
no
coast
so
barren
so
desolate
so
brutally
inhospitable
as
the
labrador
coast
from
cape
charles
at
the
strait
of
belle
isle
on
the
south
to
cape
chidley
on
the
north
along
these
eight
hundred
miles
it
is
a
constant
succession
of
bare
rocks
scoured
clean
and
smooth
by
the
ice
and
storms
of
centuries
with
not
a
green
thing
to
be
seen
save
now
and
then
a
bunch
of
stunted
shrubs
that
have
found
a
foothold
in
some
sheltered
nook
in
the
rocks
and
perchance
on
some
distant
hill
a
glimpse
of
struggling
spruce
or
fir
trees
it
is
a
dangerous
coast
with
never
a
lighthouse
or
signal
of
any
kind
at
any
point
in
its
entire
length
to
warn
or
guide
the
mariner
the
evening
was
well
upon
us
when
we
saw
the
rocks
off
cape
charles
rising
from
the
water
dismal
and
dark
and
forbidding
all
day
the
rain
had
been
falling
and
all
day
the
wind
had
been
blowing
a
gale
lashing
the
sea
into
a
fury
our
little
ship
was
tossed
about
like
a
cork
with
the
seas
constantly
breaking
over
her
decks
decidedly
our
introduction
to
labrador
was
not
auspicious
battle
harbour
twelve
miles
north
of
cape
charles
was
to
have
been
our
first
stop
but
there
are
treacherous
hidden
reefs
at
the
entrance
and
with
that
sea
the
captain
did
not
care
to
trust
his
ship
near
them
so
he
ran
on
to
spear
harbour
just
beyond
where
we
lay
to
for
the
night
the
next
day
i
made
the
following
entry
in
my
diary
early
this
morning
we
moved
down
to
battle
harbour
where
hubbard
left
us
to
return
home
it
was
a
most
dismal
time
and
place
for
her
to
part
from
her
husband
but
she
was
very
brave
it
was
not
yet
six
and
we
had
had
no
breakfast
when
she
stepped
into
the
small
boat
to
go
ashore
a
cold
drizzling
rain
was
falling
and
the
place
was
in
appearance
particularly
dreary
no
foliage
nor
green
thing
to
be
seen
nothing
but
rocks
cold
and
high
and
bleak
with
here
and
there
patches
of
snow
they
pointed
out
to
us
a
little
house
clinging
to
the
rocks
high
up
there
she
is
to
stay
until
the
steamer
comes
to
take
her
home
to
spend
a
summer
of
doubts
and
hopes
and
misgivings
poor
little
woman
it
is
so
hard
for
those
we
leave
behind
i
stood
aside
with
a
big
lump
in
my
throat
as
they
said
their
farewell
up
there
in
the
dark
wilderness
for
which
we
were
bound
hubbard
talked
with
me
frequently
of
that
parting
on
july
the
day
after
we
left
battle
harbour
the
captain
informed
us
for
the
first
time
that
the
boat
would
not
go
to
rigolet
on
the
way
up
and
gave
us
the
option
of
getting
off
at
indian
harbour
at
the
entrance
to
hamilton
inlet
or
going
on
to
nain
with
him
and
getting
off
at
rigolet
on
the
way
back
hubbard
chose
the
former
alternative
hearing
which
the
customs
officer
came
to
us
and
hinted
that
nothing
could
be
landed
until
we
had
had
an
interview
with
him
the
result
of
the
interview
was
that
hubbard
paid
duty
on
our
entire
outfit
the
next
morning
tuesday
july
we
reached
indian
harbour
amid
a
chorus
of
boys
and
good
luck
we
went
ashore
to
set
foot
for
the
first
time
on
labrador
soil
where
we
were
destined
to
encounter
a
series
of
misadventures
that
should
call
for
the
exercise
of
all
our
fortitude
and
manhood
iii
on
the
edge
of
the
wilderness
the
island
of
the
white
bear
group
upon
which
is
situated
the
settlement
of
indian
harbour
is
rocky
and
barren
the
settlement
consists
of
a
trader
hut
and
a
few
fishermen
huts
built
of
frame
plastered
over
with
earth
or
moss
and
the
buildings

a
institution
that
maintains
two
stations
on
the
labrador
coast
and
one
at

in

each
with
a

attached
the
work
of

in

patrols
the

maintained
primarily
for
the
benefit
of
the
summer
fishermen

closed
from
october
until
july
simpson
had
a
little
steamer
the
julia
sheridan
which
carried
him
on
his
visits
to
his
patients
among
the
coast
folk
we
were
told
by
the
captain
of
the
virginia
lake
that
the
julia
sheridan
would
arrive
at
indian
harbour
on
the
afternoon
of
the
day
we
reached
there
that
she
would
immediately
steam
to
rigolet
and
northwest
river
with
the
mails
and
that
we
undoubtedly
could
arrange
for
a
passage
on
her
this
was
the
reason
that
hubbard
elected
to
get
off
at
indian
harbour

cook

the
connected
with
the
indian

they
call
them

they

order
boarded
the
virginia
lake
at
battle
harbour
and
went
ashore
with
me
in
the
ship
boat
when
i
landed
with
the
baggage
hubbard
and
george
went
ashore
in
our
canoe
a
line
of
newfoundlanders
and
livyeres
stood
ready
to
greet
us
upon
our
arrival
livyeres
is
a
contraction
of
and
is
applied
to
the
people
who
live
permanently
on
the
coast
the

people
who
occasionally
trade
in

are
known
as

all

there
the

it
having
originated
with
with
the
newfoundland
fishermen
who
do
not
go
far
into
the
inlet
the
sisters
who
landed
with
us
had
difficulty
in
opening
their
hospital
as
the
locks
had
become
so
rusted
and
corroded
that
the
keys
would
not
turn
we
offered
our
assistance
and
after
removing
the
boards
that
had
been
nailed
over
the
windows
to
protect
them
from
the
winter
storms
we
found
it
necessary
to
take
out
a
pane
of
glass
in
order
that
hubbard
might
unlatch
a
window
crawl
through
and
take
the
lock
off
the
door
the
sisters
then
told
us
that
simpson
might
not
arrive
with
the
julia
sheridan
until
the
following
day
and
extended
to
us
the
hospitality
of
the
station
which
we
thankfully
accepted
taking
up
our
temporary
abode
in
one
of
the
vacant
wards
of
the
hospital
our
first
afternoon
on
labrador
soil
we
spent
in
assorting
and
packing
our
outfit
while
the
newfoundlanders
and
livyeres
stood
around
and
admired
our
things
particularly
the
canoe
guns
and
their
curiosity
was
insatiable
they
inquired
the
cost
of
every
conceivable
thing
the
next
afternoon
wednesday
simpson
arrived
on
his
steamer
and
to
our
great
disappointment
we
learned
that
the
julia
would
not
start
on
the
trip
down
the
inlet
until
after
the
return
of
the
virginia
lake
from
the
north
which
would
probably
be
on
friday
or
saturday
the
labrador
summer
being
woefully
short
hubbard
felt
that
every
hour
was
precious
and
he
chafed
under
our
enforced
detention
we
were
necessarily
going
into
the
interior
wholly
unprepared
for
winter
travel
and
hence
must
complete
our
work
and
make
our
way
out
of
the
wilderness
before
the
rivers
and
lakes
froze
and
canoe
travel
became
impossible
hubbard
felt
the
responsibility
he
had
assumed
and
could
imagine
the
difficulties
that
awaited
us
should
his
plans
miscarry
accordingly
he
began
to
look
around
immediately
among
the
fishermen
and
livyeres
for
someone
with
a
small
boat
willing
to
take
us
down
the
fifty
miles
to
rigolet
finally
after
much
persuasion
and
an
offer
of
fifteen
dollars
he
induced
a
young
livyere
steve
newell
by
name
to
undertake
the
task
steve
was
a
characteristic
livyere
shiftless
and
ambitionless
he
lived
a
few
miles
down
the
inlet
with
his
widowed
mother
and
his
younger
brothers
and
sisters
for
a
week
he
would
work
hard
and
conscientiously
to
support
the
family
and
then
take
a
month
rest
we
had
happened
upon
him
in
one
of
his
resting
periods
but
as
soon
as
hubbard
had
pinned
him
down
to
an
agreement
he
put
in
an
immediate
plea
for
money
huntin
grub
sir
he
begged
i
has
t
hunt
grub
all
th
time
sir
could
spare
a
dollar
t
buy
grub
sir
hubbard
gave
him
the
dollar
and
he
forthwith
proceeded
to
the
hut
to
purchase
flour
and
molasses
which
with
fat
salt
pork
are
the
great
staples
of
the
labrador
natives
although
the
coast
livyeres
seldom
can
afford
the
latter
dainty
while
we
were
preparing
to
start
hubbard
asked
steve
what
he
generally
did
for
a
living
i
hunts
in
winter
an
fishes
in
summer
sir
was
the
reply
what
do
you
hunt
fur
an
partridges
sir
i
trades
the
fur
for
flour
and
molasses
sir
an
us
eats
th
partridges
what
kind
of
fur
do
you
find
here
foxes
is
about
all
sir
an
them
scarce
only
a
chance
one
sir
do
you
catch
enough
fur
to
keep
you
in
flour
and
molasses
not
always
sir
sometimes
us
has
only
partridges
t
eat
sir
we
started
at
five
in
the
evening
in
steve
boat
the
mayflower
a
leaky
little
craft
that
kept
one
man
pretty
busy
bailing
out
the
water
she
carried
one
ragged
sail
and
steve
sculled
and
steered
with
a
rough
oar
about
eighteen
feet
long
an
hour
after
we
got
under
way
a
blanket
of
grey
fog
thick
and
damp
enveloped
us
but
so
long
are
the
labrador
summer
days
that
there
still
was
light
to
guide
us
when
at
eleven
steve
said
us
better
land
yere
sir
i
lives
yere
an
is
a
good
spot
t
stop
for
th
night
sir
i
wondered
what
sort
of
an
establishment
steve
maintained
and
drawing
an
inference
from
his
personal
appearance
i
had
misgivings
as
to
its
cleanliness
however
anything
seemed
better
than
chilling
fog
and
land
we
did
in
a
shallow
cove
where
we
bumped
over
a
partly
submerged
rock
and
manoeuvred
with
difficulty
among
others
that
raised
their
heads
ominously
above
the
water
as
we
approached
we
made
out
through
the
fog
the
dim
outlines
close
to
the
shore
of
a
hut
partially
covered
with
sod
our
welcome
was
tumultuous
a
combination
of
the
barking
of
dogs
and
the
shrill
screams
of
women
demanding
to
know
who
we
were
and
what
we
wanted
there
were
two
women
tall
scrawny
brown
with
hair
flying
at
random
the
younger
one
had
a
baby
in
her
arms
she
was
steve
married
sister
the
other
woman
was
his
mother
each
was
loosely
clad
in
a
dirty
calico
gown
behind
them
clustered
a
group
of
dirty
children
steve
ushered
us
into
the
hut
which
proved
to
have
two
rooms
the
larger
about
eight
by
ten
feet
the
roof
was
so
low
that
none
of
us
could
stand
erect
except
in
the
centre
where
it
came
to
a
peak
in
the
outer
room
were
two
rough
wooden
benches
and
on
a
rickety
table
a
dirty
kerosene
lamp
without
a
chimney
shed
gloom
rather
than
light
an
old
stove
the
sides
of
which
were
bolstered
up
with
rocks
filled
the
hut
with
smoke
to
the
point
of
suffocation
when
a
fire
was
started
the
floor
and
everything
else
in
the
room
were
innocent
of
soap
and
water
george
made
coffee
which
he
passed
around
with
hardtack
to
everybody
then
all
but
steve
and
our
party
retired
to
the
inner
room
one
of
the
women
standing
a
loose
door
against
the
aperture
steve
curled
up
in
an
old
quilt
on
one
of
the
benches
while
hubbard
george
and
i
spread
a
tarpaulin
on
the
floor
and
rolled
in
our
blankets
upon
it
we
were
up
betimes
the
next
morning
after
a
fair
night
sleep
on
the
floor
we
again
served
hardtack
and
coffee
to
all
and
at
five
were
once
more
on
our
way
a
thick
mantle
of
mist
obscured
the
shore
and
hubbard
offered
steve
a
chart
and
compass
ai
got
no
learnin
sir
i
ca
read
sir
said
the
young
livyere
so
hubbard
directed
the
course
in
the
mist
while
steve
steered
later
in
the
day
the
wind
freshened
and
blew
the
mist
away
and
at
length
developed
into
a
gale
finally
the
sea
rose
so
high
that
steve
thought
it
well
to
seek
the
protection
of
a
harbour
and
we
landed
in
a
sheltered
cove
on
one
of
the
numerous
islands
that
strew
hamilton
inlet
where
we
then
were
big
black
island
it
is
called
george
had
arisen
that
morning
with
a
lame
back
and
when
we
reached
the
island
he
could
scarcely
move
the
place
was
so
barren
of
timber
we
could
not
find
a
stick
long
enough
to
act
as
a
centre
pole
for
our
tent
and
it
was
useless
to
try
to
pitch
it
however
the
moss
being
thick
and
soft
made
a
comfortable
bed
and
after
we
had
put
a
mustard
plaster
on
george
back
to
relieve
his
lumbago
we
rolled
him
in
two
of
our
blankets
under
the
lee
of
a
bush
and
let
him
sleep
then
as
evening
came
on
hubbard
and
i
started
for
a
stroll
along
the
shore
the
sun
was
still
high
in
the
heavens
and
the
temperature
mildly
cool
a
walk
of
a
mile
or
so
brought
us
to
the
cabin
of
one
joe
lloyd
a
livyere
lloyd
proved
to
be
an
intelligent
old
englishman
who
had
gone
to
labrador
as
a
sailor
lad
on
a
fishing
schooner
to
serve
a
apprenticeship
he
did
not
go
home
with
his
ship
and
year
after
year
postponed
his
return
until
at
last
he
married
an
eskimo
and
bound
himself
fast
to
the
cold
rocks
of
labrador
where
he
will
spend
the
remainder
of
his
life
eking
out
a
miserable
existence
a
lonely
exile
from
his
native
england
after
he
had
greeted
us
lloyd
asked
is
all
the
world
at
peace
sir
he
had
heard
of
the
boer
war
and
was
pleased
when
we
told
him
that
it
had
ended
in
a
victory
for
the
british
arms
his
hunger
for
news
touched
us
deeply
and
we
told
him
all
that
we
could
recall
of
recent
affairs
of
public
interest
i
have
said
that
his
hunger
for
news
touched
us
as
a
matter
of
fact
few
things
have
impressed
me
as
being
more
pathetic
than
that
old
man
life
up
there
on
that
isolated
and
desolate
island
where
he
spends
most
of
his
time
wistfully
longing
to
hear
something
of
the
great
world
and
painfully
recalling
the
pleasant
memories
of
his
childhood
home
and
friends
and
the
green
fields
and
spring
blossoms
he
never
will
know
again
and
lloyd
story
is
the
story
of
perhaps
the
majority
of
the
settlers
on
the
labrador
the
old
man
had
a
salmon
and
we
bought
it
from
him
we
then
sat
for
a
few
minutes
in
his
cabin
this
was
a
miserable
affair
not
exceeding
eight
by
ten
feet
and
like
steve
home
so
low
we
could
not
stand
erect
in
it
the
floor
was
paved
with
large
flat
stones
and
the
only
vent
for
the
smoke
from
the
wretched
fireplace
was
a
hole
in
the
roof
midway
between
the
fire
and
the
hole
hung
a
trout
drying
in
this
room
lloyd
and
his
eskimo
wife
live
out
their
life
during
our
visit
the
wife
sat
there
without
uttering
a
word
her
silence
was
characteristic
for
somewhat
unlike
our
women
the
women
of
labrador
talk
but
little
when
we
had
bidden
lloyd
farewell
we
carried
the
salmon
we
had
obtained
from
him
back
to
camp
where
hubbard
tried
to
plank
it
on
a
bit
of
wreckage
picked
up
on
the
shore
it
fell
into
the
fire
and
there
was
great
excitement
until
by
our
united
efforts
we
had
rescued
it
and
had
seen
part
of
it
safely
reposing
in
the
frying
pan
while
steve
set
to
work
boiling
the
remainder
in
our
kettle
with
slices
of
bacon
as
the
gale
continued
to
blow
it
was
decided
that
we
should
remain
in
camp
until
early
morning
hubbard
directed
steve
to
pull
the
boat
around
to
a
place
where
it
would
be
near
the
water
at
low
tide
he
and
i
then
threw
down
the
tent
lay
on
it
pulled
a
blanket
over
us
and
prepared
for
sleep
it
was
about
eleven
and
darkness
was
just
beginning
to
fall
out
in
the
bay
a
whale
was
blowing
and
in
the
distance
big
gulls
were
screaming
it
was
our
first
night
out
in
the
open
in
labrador
and
all
was
new
and
entrancing
and
as
slumber
gradually
enwrapped
us
it
seemed
to
us
that
we
had
fallen
upon
pleasant
times
at
one
friday
morning
we
awoke
by
the
light
of
the
brilliant
moon
we
made
coffee
called
george
and
steve
and
ate
our
breakfast
of
cold
salmon
and
hardtack
george
lumbago
was
very
bad
and
he
was
unable
to
do
any
work
the
rest
of
us
portaged
the
outfit
two
hundred
yards
to
the
boat
which
owing
to
steve
miscalculations
as
to
the
tide
we
found
high
and
dry
on
the
rocks
working
in
the
shallow
water
with
a
cloud
of
mosquitoes
around
our
heads
it
took
us
until
to
launch
her
by
which
time
daylight
long
since
had
returned
once
more
afloat
we
found
that
the
wind
had
entirely
died
away
and
steve
sculling
pushed
the
boat
along
but
slowly
grampuses
raised
their
big
backs
everywhere
and
seals
upon
which
they
prey
were
numerous
the
water
was
alive
with
schools
of
caplin
at
eleven
we
made
pompey
island
a
mossy
island
of
laurentian
rock
about
miles
from
indian
harbour
here
we
stopped
for
luncheon
and
after
much
looking
around
succeeded
in
finding
enough
sticks
to
build
a
little
fire
i
made
flapjacks
and
hubbard
melted
sugar
for
syrup
while
we
were
eating
i
discovered
in
the
far
distance
the
smoke
of
a
steamer
we
supposed
it
to
be
the
julia
sheridan
rushing
our
things
into
the
boat
we
put
off
as
quickly
as
possible
to
intercept
her
we
fired
three
or
four
shots
from
our
rifle
but
got
only
a
salute
in
recognition
then
hubbard
and
i
scramble
into
the
canoe
which
we
had
in
tow
and
began
to
paddle
with
might
and
main
to
head
her
off
as
we
neared
her
we
fired
again
at
that
she
came
about
it
was
the
virginia
lake
they
took
us
on
board
bag
baggage
and
canoe
and
steve
was
dismissed
in
an
hour
we
were
in
sight
of
rigolet
and
i
saw
a
hudson
bay
company
post
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
as
our
steamer
approached
a
flag
was
run
up
in
salute
to
the
top
of
a
tall
staff
and
when
it
had
been
caught
by
the
breeze
the
company
initials
were
revealed
the
company
agents
say
these
letters
have
another
significance
namely
here
before
christ
for
the
flag
travels
ahead
of
the
missionaries
the
reservation
of
rigolet
is
situated
upon
a
projection
of
land
with
a
little
bay
on
one
side
and
the
channel
into
which
hamilton
inlet
narrows
at
this
point
on
the
other
long
rows
of
whitewashed
buildings
some
of
frame
and
some
of
log
extend
along
the
water
front
coming
together
at
the
point
of
the
projection
so
as
to
form
two
sides
of
an
irregular
triangle
a
little
back
of
the
row
on
the
bay
side
and
upon
slightly
higher
ground
stands
the
residence
of
the
agent
or
factor
as
he
is
officially
called
this
building
being
two
stories
high
and
otherwise
the
most
pretentious
of
the
group
it
is
commonly
called
the
big
house
and
near
it
is
the
tall
flagstaff
between
the
rows
of
buildings
and
the
shore
is
a
broad
board
walk
which
leads
down
near
the
apex
of
the
triangle
to
a
small
wharf
of
logs
it
was
at
this
wharf
that
our
little
party
landed
hubbard
presented
his
letter
of
introduction
from
commissioner
chipman
of
the
hudson
bay
company
to
james
fraser
the
factor
and
we
received
a
most
cordial
welcome
being
made
at
home
at
the
big
house
we
found
the
surroundings
and
people
unique
and
interesting
there
were
lumbermen
trappers
and
fishermen
a
motley
gathering
of
newfoundlanders
nova
scotians
eskimos
and
breeds
the
latter
being
a
comprehensive
name
for
persons
whose
origin
is
a
mixture
in
various
combinations
and
proportions
of
eskimo
indian
and
european
all
were
friendly
and
talkative
and
hungry
for
news
of
the
outside
world
lying
around
everywhere
or
skulking
about
the
reservation
were
big
eskimo
dogs
that
looked
for
all
the
world
like
wolves
in
subjection
we
were
warned
not
to
attempt
to
play
with
them
as
they
were
extremely
treacherous
only
a
few
days
before
a
little
eskimo
boy
who
stumbled
and
fell
was
set
upon
by
a
pack
and
all
but
killed
before
the
brutes
were
driven
off
the
night
we
arrived
at
rigolet
the
pack
killed
one
of
their
own
number
and
ate
him
only
a
little
piece
of
fur
remaining
in
the
morning
to
tell
the
tale
within
an
hour
after
we
reached
the
post
simpson
arrived
on
the
julia
sheridan
but
as
he
had
neglected
to
bring
the
mail
for
northwest
river
post
that
the
virginia
lake
had
left
at
indian
harbour
he
had
to
return
at
once
simpson
not
being
permitted
by
his
principles
to
run
his
boat
on
sunday
unless
in
a
case
of
great
necessity
we
were
told
not
to
expect
the
julia
sheridan
back
from
indian
harbour
until
monday
noon
and
so
we
were
compelled
to
possess
our
souls
in
patience
and
enjoy
the
hospitality
of
fraser
i
must
confess
that
while
i
was
anxious
to
get
on
i
was
at
the
same
time
not
so
greatly
disappointed
at
our
enforced
delay
it
gave
me
an
opportunity
to
see
something
of
the
novel
life
of
the
post
while
at
rigolet
we
of
course
tried
to
get
all
the
information
possible
about
the
country
to
which
we
were
going
no
indians
had
been
to
the
post
for
months
and
the
white
men
and
eskimos
knew
absolutely
nothing
about
it
at
length
hubbard
was
referred
to
skipper
tom
blake
a
breed
who
had
trapped
at
the
upper
or
western
end
of
grand
lake
from
blake
he
learned
that
grand
lake
was
forty
miles
long
and
that
canoe
travel
on
it
was
good
to
its
upper
end
where
the
nascaupee
river
flowed
into
it
blake
believed
we
could
paddle
up
the
nascaupee
some
eighteen
or
twenty
miles
where
we
should
find
the
red
river
a
wide
shallow
rapid
stream
that
flowed
into
the
nascaupee
from
the
south
above
this
point
he
had
no
personal
knowledge
of
the
country
and
advised
us
to
see
his
son
donald
whom
he
expected
to
arrive
that
day
from
his
trapping
grounds
on
seal
lake
donald
he
said
had
been
farther
inland
and
knew
more
about
the
country
than
anyone
else
on
the
coast
donald
did
arrive
a
little
later
and
upon
questioning
him
hubbard
learned
that
seal
lake
which
he
said
was
an
expansion
of
the
nascaupee
river
had
been
the
limit
of
his
travels
inland
donald
reiterated
what
his
father
had
told
us
of
grand
lake
and
the
lower
waters
of
the
nascaupee
adding
that
for
many
miles
above
the
point
where
the
nascaupee
was
joined
by
the
red
we
should
find
canoe
travel
impossible
as
the
nascaupee
tumbled
right
down
off
the
mountains
up
the
nascaupee
as
far
as
the
red
river
he
had
sailed
his
boat
he
had
heard
from
the
indians
that
the
nascaupee
came
from
lake
michikamau
and
he
believed
it
to
be
a
fact
this
convinced
us
that
the
nascaupee
was
the
river
low
of
the
geological
survey
had
mapped
as
the
northwest
the
red
river
donald
had
crossed
in
winter
some
twenty
miles
above
its
mouth
and
while
it
was
wide
it
was
so
shallow
and
swift
that
he
was
sure
it
would
not
admit
of
canoeing
he
could
not
tell
its
source
and
was
sure
the
indians
had
never
travelled
on
it
in
answer
to
hubbard
inquiries
as
to
the
probability
of
our
getting
fish
and
game
donald
said
there
were
bears
along
the
nascaupee
but
few
other
animals
he
had
never
fished
the
waters
above
grand
lake
but
believed
plenty
of
fish
were
there
on
seal
lake
there
was
a
chance
seal
and
he
had
taken
an
occasional
shot
at
them
but
they
were
very
wild
and
he
had
never
been
able
to
kill
any
strange
as
it
may
seem
none
of
the
men
with
whom
we
talked
mentioned
that
more
than
one
river
flowed
into
grand
lake
although
they
unquestionably
knew
that
such
was
the
case
their
silence
about
this
important
particular
was
probably
due
to
the
fact
that
while
the
labrador
people
are
friendly
to
strangers
they
are
somewhat
shy
and
rarely
volunteer
information
contenting
themselves
for
the
most
part
with
simple
answers
to
direct
questions
furthermore
they
are
seldom
able
to
adopt
a
point
of
view
different
from
their
own
and
thus
are
unable
to
realise
the
amount
of
guidance
a
stranger
in
their
country
needs
in
fact
i
discovered
later
that
skipper
blake
and
his
son
who
have
spent
all
their
lives
in
the
vicinity
of
hamilton
inlet
never
dreamed
anyone
could
miss
the
mouth
of
the
nascaupee
river
as
they
themselves
knew
so
well
how
to
find
it
we
were
sitting
in
the
office
of
the
post
on
sunday
comfortably
away
from
the
fog
that
lay
thick
outside
when
we
were
startled
by
a
steamship
whistle
out
we
all
ran
and
there
in
the
act
of
dropping
her
anchor
was
the
pelican
the
company
ship
from
england
in
the
heavy
fog
she
had
stolen
in
and
whistled
before
the
flag
was
raised
which
feat
captain
grey
who
commands
the
pelican
regarded
as
a
great
joke
on
the
post
once
a
year
the
pelican
arrives
from
england
and
the
day
of
her
appearance
is
the
big
day
for
all
the
labrador
posts
as
she
brings
the
year
supplies
together
with
boxes
and
letters
from
home
for
the
agents
and
the
clerks
from
rigolet
she
goes
to
ungava
then
returns
to
rigolet
for
the
furs
there
and
once
more
steams
for
england
we
found
captain
grey
to
be
a
jolly
cranky
old
seadog
of
the
old
school
he
has
been
with
the
hudson
bay
company
for
thirty
years
and
has
sailed
the
northern
seas
for
fifty
he
shook
his
head
pessimistically
when
he
heard
about
our
expedition
you
never
get
back
he
said
but
if
you
happen
to
be
at
ungava
when
i
get
there
i
bring
you
back
sandy
calder
the
owner
of
lumber
mills
on
sandwich
bay
and
the
grand
river
who
came
from
cartwright
post
on
sandwich
bay
with
captain
grey
on
the
pelican
also
predicted
the
failure
of
our
enterprise
but
hubbard
said
to
me
that
he
had
heard
such
prophecies
before
that
they
made
the
work
seem
all
the
bigger
and
that
he
could
do
it
and
would
at
noon
on
monday
simpson
came
with
the
julia
sheridan
and
we
said
to
rigolet
the
voyage
down
the
inlet
to
northwest
river
post
was
without
incident
except
that
the
good
doctor
was
much
concerned
as
to
the
outcome
of
our
venture
saying
do
leave
your
bones
up
there
to
whiten
boys
if
you
can
possibly
help
it
we
reached
northwest
river
at
two
on
tuesday
afternoon
and
found
the
post
to
be
much
the
same
as
rigolet
except
that
its
whitewashed
buildings
were
all
strung
out
in
one
long
row
the
welcome
we
received
from
thomas
mackenzie
the
agent
there
in
charge
was
most
gratifying
in
its
heartiness
mackenzie
is
a
bachelor
tall
lean
and
the
soul
hospitality
hubbard
promptly
dubbed
him
a
bully
fellow
probably
this
was
partly
due
to
the
fact
that
he
was
the
first
man
in
labrador
to
give
us
any
encouragement
we
had
not
been
there
an
hour
when
he
became
infected
with
hubbard
enthusiasm
and
said
he
would
pack
up
that
night
and
be
ready
to
start
with
us
in
the
morning
if
he
only
were
free
to
do
so
to
our
great
disappointment
and
chagrin
we
found
that
mackenzie
had
no
fish
nets
to
sell
we
had
been
unable
to
obtain
any
at
rigolet
and
now
we
were
told
that
none
was
to
be
had
anywhere
in
that
part
of
labrador
hubbard
realised
fully
the
importance
of
a
gill
net
as
a
part
of
our
equipment
and
had
originally
intended
to
purchase
one
before
leaving
new
york
but
he
was
advised
by
low
of
the
canadian
geological
survey
that
it
would
be
better
to
defer
its
purchase
until
we
reached
rigolet
post
or
northwest
river
where
he
said
we
could
get
a
net
such
as
would
be
best
adapted
to
the
country
hubbard
had
no
reason
to
doubt
the
accuracy
of
this
information
as
low
had
previously
spent
several
months
at
these
posts
when
engaged
in
the
work
of
mapping
out
the
peninsula
conditions
however
had
changed
unfortunately
for
us
since
low
visit
to
labrador
seeing
the
quandary
we
were
in
mackenzie
got
out
an
old
gill
net
that
had
been
lying
in
a
corner
of
one
of
his
buildings
he
said
he
was
afraid
it
was
worn
out
but
if
we
could
make
any
use
of
it
we
might
take
it
we
too
had
our
doubts
as
to
its
utility
but
as
it
was
the
best
obtainable
hubbard
accepted
it
thankfully
and
mackenzie
had
two
of
his
men
unravel
it
and
patch
it
up
during
the
afternoon
we
got
our
outfit
in
shape
ready
for
the
start
in
the
morning
following
is
a
summary
of
the
outfit
taken
from
an
inventory
made
at
indian
harbour
our
canoe
was
feet
long
canvas
covered
and
weighed
about
pounds
the
tent
was
of
the
type
known
as
miner
x
feet
made
of
balloon
silk
and
waterproofed
we
had
three
pairs
of
blankets
and
one
single
blanket
two
tarpaulins
five
duck
waterproof
bags
one
dozen
small
waterproof
bags
of
balloon

with
electricians
tape
a
sextant
and
artificial
horizon
two
compasses
and
our
cooking
utensils
and
clothing
at
indian
harbour
we
had
four
sacks
of
flour
but
hubbard
gave
one
sack
to
the
pilot
of
the
julia
sheridan
and
out
of
another
sack
he
had
given
the
cook
on
the
julia
sufficient
flour
for
one
baking
of
bread
and
we
had
also
used
some
of
this
bag
on
our
way
from
indian
harbour
to
rigolet
this
left
two
bags
and
about
thirty
pounds
in
the
third
bag
or
pounds
in
all
there
were
perhaps
pounds
of
bacon

pounds
tea
pounds
coffee
pounds
hardtack

milk
powder
pounds
rice
pounds
dried
apples
pounds
salt
or
pounds
tobacco
and
pounds
sugar
this
outfit
it
will
be
remembered
was
designed
for
three
men
hubbard
tried
to
hire
some
of
the
native
to
accompany
us
a
few
miles
into
the
interior
and
carry
additional
provisions
that
we
might
cache
but
failed
they
were
all
too
busy
mackenzie
treated
us
royally
during
the
evening
we
spent
at
his
post
and
we
enjoyed
his
hospitality
to
the
utmost
knowing
that
it
was
to
be
our
last
night
under
shelter
for
weeks
to
come
now
we
were
on
the
very
edge
of
the
wilderness
we
should
enter
the
unknown
iv
the
plunge
into
the
wild
it
was
nine
on
wednesday
morning
july
that
we
made
the
start
our
canoe
laden
deep
with
our
outfit
was
drawn
up
with
its
prow
resting
snugly
on
the
sandy
bottom
of
the
little
strait
that
is
locally
known
as
the
northwest
river
mackenzie
and
a
group
of
swarthy
natives
gathered
on
the
shore
to
see
us
off
all
but
the
agent
were
grave
and
sceptical
and
shook
their
heads
at
our
persistency
in
going
into
a
country
we
had
been
so
frequently
warned
against
the
atmosphere
was
crisp
pure
and
exhilarating
the
fir
trees
and
shrubs
gave
out
a
delicious
perfume
and
their
waving
tops
seemed
to
beckon
us
on
the
sky
was
deep
blue
with
here
and
there
a
feathery
cloud
gliding
lazily
over
its
surface
the
bright
sunlight
made
our
hearts
bound
and
filled
our
bodies
with
vigour
and
as
we
stood
there
on
the
edge
of
the
unknown
and
silent
world
we
had
come
so
far
to
see
our
hopes
were
high
and
one
and
all
we
were
eager
for
the
battle
with
the
wild
i
wish
i
were
going
with
you
and
godspeed
shouted
mackenzie
as
we
pushed
the
canoe
into
deep
water
and
dipped
our
paddles
into
the
current
in
a
moment
he
and
the
grave
men
that
stood
with
him
were
lost
to
view
up
through
the
strait
into
the
little
lake
we
paddled
thence
to
the
rapid
where
the
waters
of
grand
lake
pour
out
with
one
end
of
a
tracking
line
hubbard
sprang
into
the
shallow
water
near
the
shore
below
the
stream
and
with
the
other
end
fastened
to
the
bow
of
the
canoe
pulled
it
through
the
rapid
a
planter
family
in
a
cabin
near
by
watched
us
wonderingly
then
we
were
in
grand
lake
hubbard
remarked
that
it
looked
like
lake
george
save
that
the
hills
were
lower
for
a
few
miles
above
its
outlet
the
shores
on
both
sides
of
the
lake
are
low
then
on
the
south
come
bluffs
that
rise
stern
and
grand
in
their
nudity
almost
perpendicularly
from
the
deep
clear
water
while
on
the
north
come
lower
hills
the
most
part
wooded
that
retreat
more
gently
from
the
rocky
shore
heading
for
the
extreme
upper
of
the
lake
where
map
and
the
natives
had
led
us
to
expect
we
should
find
the
northwest
or
nascaupee
river
we
paddled
along
the
north
shore
to
a
point
where
we
stopped
among
the
rocks
for
a
luncheon
of
flapjacks
and
syrup
we
were
away
without
waste
of
time
paddling
diagonally
across
the
lake
to
the
south
shore
the
fleecy
clouds
had
now
thickened
and
a
few
drops
of
rain
had
fallen
in
our
course
across
the
lake
we
passed
cape
corbeau
raven
but
were
so
far
out
that
the
mouth
of
the
river
of
that
name
which
is
just
east
of
it
escaped
our
attention
cape
corbeau
it
had
been
named
by
a
french
missionary
because
the
ravens
build
their
nests
on
its
rocky
top
and
perched
high
up
croak
at
you
warningly
from
afar
always
the
ravens
are
there
involuntarily
as
one
croaked
above
our
heads
nevermore
echoed
through
my
mind
and
my
soul
from
out
that
shadow
shall
be
lifted
nevermore
there
were
dark
shadows
ahead
of
us
among
the
rocks
and
the
forests
and
but
in
a
moment
the
thought
was
drowned
and
forgotten
in
the
beauties
of
the
scenery
beauties
yes
for
bleak
and
desolate
labrador
has
a
beauty
and
a
charm
all
its
own
two
hours
after
passing
cape
corbeau
the
rain
began
to
pour
and
at
when
we
made
camp
on
the
south
shore
we
were
well
soaked
we
resumed
our
journey
at
in
the
morning
a
stiff
breeze
was
blowing
but
by
keeping
in
the
lee
of
the
shore
we
made
good
progress
at
ten
when
we
found
it
necessary
to
cross
to
the
north
shore
so
as
to
shorten
the
distance
there
was
a
rising
sea
and
we
had
to
lighten
the
canoe
and
ferry
the
cargo
over
in
two
loads
it
was
soon
after
one
that
we
reached
the
upper
end
of
the
lake
where
we
found
a
stream
about
yards
wide
that
flowed
with
a
swift
current
from
out
a
little
lake
into
this
lake
after
luncheon
we
paddled
and
when
we
reached
its
upper
end
there
was
the
mouth
of
a
river
which
we
immediately
hailed
as
the
nascaupee
the
stream
that
was
to
lead
us
up
to
lake
michikamau
its
mouth
was
wide
and
it
seemed
to
answer
so
well
all
the
descriptions
we
had
heard
of
the
river
for
which
we
were
searching
that
the
possibility
of
our
being
mistaken
never
once
entered
our
heads
in
fact
we
remained
under
the
impression
that
it
was
the
nascaupee
until
the
last
but
we
were
mistaken
we
had
passed
the
nascaupee
five
miles
below
where
it
empties
together
with
the
crooked
river
into
a
deep
bay
extending
northward
from
grand
lake
at
its
mouth
the
nascaupee
is
divided
by
an
island
into
two
streams
and
this
island
is
so
thickly
covered
with
trees
and
the
streams
on
either
side
of
it
are
so
narrow
that
when
we
crossed
along
in
front
of
the
bay
no
break
in
the
line
of
woods
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
was
perceptible
perhaps
it
will
be
said
we
should
have
explored
the
bay
i
know
now
myself
that
should
have
been
done
but
in
justice
to
hubbard
it
must
be
remembered
that
none
of
us
then
had
any
reason
to
suppose
we
should
find
a
river
at
any
place
other
than
the
extreme
upper
end
of
the
lake
time
and
time
again
hubbard
had
asked
the
few
natives
who
had
been
there
if
the
nascaupee
entered
grand
lake
at
its
extreme
upper
end
and
the
answer
invariably
had
been
yes
sir
he
do
furthermore
it
will
have
to
be
taken
into
consideration
how
hard
pressed
hubbard
was
by
the
fear
that
the
short
summer
would
end
before
he
had
completed
his
work
and
by
the
consequent
necessity
of
pushing
on
with
all
possible
speed
the
river
up
which
we
started
to
ascend
with
light
hearts
was
the
susan
a
river
which
was
to
introduce
us
promptly
to
hardships
a
river
which
is
to
me
associated
with
the
most
tragic
memories
on
the
southerly
side
of
the
little
lake
porcupine
hill
raises
its
head
a
thousand
feet
above
the
water
proceeding
up
the
susan
we
found
that
the
river
valley
was
enclosed
by
low
ridges
covered
with
spruce
and
a
few
scattering
white
birch
and
aspen
trees
for
the
most
part
the
banks
of
the
river
were
steep
and
high
where
they
were
low
the
river
formed
little
pond
expansions
for
a
mile
above
its
mouth
we
had
good
canoeing
up
to
this
point
the
river
was
not
more
than
thirty
yards
wide
and
was
deep
with
little
current
then
it
began
gradually
to
widen
and
become
shallow
and
swift
with
a
bottom
soon
we
had
to
jump
into
the
water
and
with
hubbard
at
the
end
of
the
tracking
line
and
george
and
i
at
either
end
of
the
canoe
haul
lift
and
push
the
heavily
laden
boat
up
the
river
while
we
floundered
over
the
boulders
sometimes
we
would
be
able
to
get
into
the
canoe
and
pole
but
never
for
long
around
the
worst
places
we
portaged
the
whole
outfit
canoe
and
all
it
was
desperately
hard
work
and
when
night
came
on
and
we
went
into
camp
we
were
only
two
miles
above
the
little
lake
hard
as
it
was
we
should
not
have
minded
our
work
in
the
rapids
so
much
had
it
not
been
for
the
flies
for
the
first
time
we
now
realised
the
full
form
of
what
had
been
told
us
about
the
fly
pest
of
labrador
we
had
considered
them
annoying
at
rigolet
and
northwest
river
but
as
soon
as
we
began
to
buck
the
rapids
they
came
upon
us
in
clouds
they
got
into
our
nostrils
into
our
ears
into
our
mouths
into
our
eyes
even
and
our
faces
and
hands
were
streaked
with
blood
from
their
bites
they
were
villainous
hellish
hubbard
frequently
remarked
that
the
mosquitoes
seemed
friendly
in
contrast
and
the
mosquitoes
were
by
no
means
considerate
of
our
feelings
and
comfort
either
we
had
purchased
some
cheesecloth
at
rigolet
for
face
nets
but
the
trial
we
had
given
it
during
the
afternoon
had
proved
that
it
was
too
closely
woven
for
us
to
see
through
it
and
do
our
work
and
it
was
useful
only
as
some
measure
of
protection
for
our
ears
and
necks
on
our
faces
we
also
tried
some
fly
dope
that
we
had
purchased
in
new
york
but
it
kept
the
pests
away
for
a
few
minutes
only
the
ordinary
labrador
fly
is
smaller
than
a
pinhead
you
do
not
feel
it
until
after
it
has
had
its
bite
and
then
the
sensation
is
like
that
of
a
fiery
itch
in
addition
to
this
kind
we
had
to
withstand
the
attacks
of
flies
called
by
the
natives
bulldogs
these
beasts
are
about
the
size
of
the
top
joint
of
one
thumb
they
are
well
named
when
they
bite
you
feel
it
immediately
beyond
a
doubt
we
used
to
say
they
bit
out
pieces
of
our
flesh
entire
and
flew
up
into
the
trees
to
eat
them
and
we
used
frequently
to
beg
george
to
try
his
luck
at
shooting
the
brutes
however
it
must
be
said
to
the
credit
of
both
kinds
of
flies
that
they
have
one
good
habit
they
knock
off
work
at
the
approach
of
the
cool
of
evening
thus
giving
you
a
chance
to
bathe
as
well
as
sleep
the
rain
was
still
pouring
when
we
pitched
our
tent
that
first
night
but
we
had
a
good
supper
and
were
reasonably
cheerful
there
were
flapjacks
dripping
with
the
syrup
of
melted
sugar
and
bacon
and
hot
bread
and
coffee
with
this
sort
of
work
before
us
said
hubbard
we
must
keep
well
fed
the
river
said
i
certainly
is
the
limit
if
the
indians
have
to
travel
on
it
much
i
feel
sorry
for
them
well
said
hubbard
we
surely
got
our
work
cut
out
at
this
rate
we
going
to
make
pretty
slow
progress
blake
told
us
i
ventured
we
could
paddle
up
the
river
eighteen
or
twenty
miles
and
that
he
had
sailed
his
boat
up
that
far
i
be
willing
to
bet
he
never
sailed
it
up
this
stream
oh
replied
hubbard
he
was
mistaken
in
the
distance
this
must
be
the
place
where
he
said
the
river
tumbled
off
the
mountain
what
do
you
say
boys
he
added
to
throwing
away
some
of
the
outfit
never
make
any
progress
if
we
attempt
to
carry
it
all
let
stick
to
it
a
little
longer
suggested
george
however
we
decided
to
abandon
some
clothing
and
a
pail
containing
about
four
pounds
of
lard
and
as
george
particularly
was
opposed
to
leaving
behind
us
any
provisions
it
was
decided
to
eat
of
them
lavishly
and
pay
no
attention
to
the
hunt
for
the
present
all
night
it
continued
to
rain
and
we
broke
camp
and
started
forward
on
friday
morning
july
in
a
drenching
downpour
george
thought
this
was
rather
hard
while
hubbard
was
out
of
hearing
he
told
me
that
the
indians
never
travelled
in
the
rain
and
that
he
had
never
been
expected
to
do
so
before
the
fact
was
that
george
had
never
before
been
on
an
expedition
where
there
was
so
much
necessity
for
haste
we
found
the
river
on
the
second
day
to
be
even
worse
than
our
worst
fears
had
pictured
it
and
it
kept
growing
worse
as
we
ascended
the
water
was
so
swift
and
shoal
that
we
could
take
only
a
part
of
the
outfit
in
the
canoe
which
meant
that
we
had
to
return
at
intervals
for
the
rest
and
track
all
the
way
hubbard
pulling
on
the
line
while
george
and
i
waded
and
pushed
sometimes
we
were
scarcely
knee
deep
in
the
water
and
at
other
times
we
would
sink
up
to
our
armpits
frequently
we
were
swept
off
our
feet
once
or
twice
we
forced
the
canoe
and
outfit
through
the
thick
willows
and
alders
that
lined
the
river
and
dragged
them
up
the
steep
bank
and
attempted
to
portage
but
the
country
here
had
been
burned
and
fallen
trees
were
piled
high
in
every
direction
so
that
we
were
compelled
to
return
to
the
river
and
resume
our
efforts
in
the
raging
torrent
the
work
was
awful
it
was
heartrending
and
though
we
exerted
ourselves
to
the
utmost
from
six
in
the
morning
until
eight
at
night
we
advanced
our
camp
only
two
miles
that
day
and
when
we
gathered
around
the
fire
at
night
how
we
did
cuss
that
river
none
of
us
however
was
discouraged
nor
flinched
at
the
prospect
our
cowhide
moccasins
and
woollen
trousers
were
beginning
to
show
the
result
of
the
attacks
of
bush
rock
and
water
but
our
blue
flannel
shirts
and
soft
felt
hats
were
still
quite
respectable
our
coats
we
had
left
behind
us
as
an
unnecessary
encumbrance
while
george
was
cooking
breakfast
on
saturday
morning
july
a
red
squirrel
barked
at
us
from
a
tree
drawing
his
pistol
from
its
holster
hubbard
said
wallace
let
see
who
shall
have
the
honour
of
bringing
to
george
the
first
game
of
the
trip
i
acquiesced
and
walking
around
the
tree
caught
the
first
glimpse
of
the
squirrel
at
it
i
carefully
aimed
my
pistol
and
down
it
came
it
made
a
tiny
morsel
for
three
men
but
as
the
first
game
of
the
trip
we
hugely
enjoyed
it
when
george
served
it
in
a
pot
of
soup
at
six
we
broke
camp
and
laboured
on
facing
the
same
desperate
conditions
that
we
had
met
the
day
before
it
is
true
that
the
rain
had
ceased
to
fall
but
the
good
weather
brought
out
the
flies
in
increasing
swarms
we
fairly
breathed
flies
and
we
dreaded
them
far
more
than
the
hard
work
since
they
attacked
us
first
we
had
left
our
faces
unwashed
so
as
to
retain
the
dope
and
they
were
streaming
with
a
mixture
of
grease
dirt
blood
and
perspiration
the
return
of
the
sun
also
sent
the
mercury
soaring
at
noon
that
saturday
it
registered
degrees
in
the
shade
always
at
sunset
however
the
temperature
dropped
with
startling
suddenness
and
a
variation
of
from
fifty
to
sixty
degrees
between
the
maximum
and
minimum
record
for
one
day
was
not
an
unusual
thing
as
long
as
summer
lasted
floundering
up
the
river
that
saturday
we
found
the
heat
so
oppressive
that
it
seemed
to
us
we
had
got
into
the
torrid
zone
instead
of
up
to
within
a
few
hundred
miles
of
the
arctic
circle
we
resolved
however
that
the
obstacles
interposed
against
our
advance
by
the
unfeeling
wild
should
make
us
fight
only
the
harder
george
and
i
receiving
much
inspiration
from
hubbard
to
whom
difficulties
were
a
blessing
and
whose
spirit
remained
indomitable
up
to
the
very
end
and
when
we
sat
down
to
our
evening
meal
by
a
cosey
fire
we
had
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
we
had
doubled
our
previous
day
record
and
were
four
miles
further
up
the
river
on
our
first
sunday
out
we
remained
in
camp
to
rest
we
were
all
pretty
tired
and
enjoyed
the
long
sleep
in
the
morning
the
day
was
fine
but
very
warm
in
the
morning
hubbard
caught
about
twenty
small
trout
and
after
luncheon
he
and
george
went
up
the
river
on
a
scouting
trip
when
they
returned
in
the
evening
they
reported
important
discoveries
first
they
had
come
upon
a
small
rocky
stream
flowing
into
our
river
from
the
south
which
stream
hubbard
felt
sure
must
be
the
red
river
the
blakes
had
told
us
about
and
a
mile
above
that
a
stretch
of
good
water
but
the
discovery
that
pleased
hubbard
the
most
was
some
old
cuttings
that
apparently
had
been
made
by
indians
he
was
of
the
opinion
as
were
all
of
us
that
they
indicated
we
really
were
on
the
mountaineer
indian
trail
to
michikamau
and
that
we
undoubtedly
soon
should
come
upon
lakes
and
other
good
water
that
would
carry
us
through
and
the
discoveries
of
the
scouting
trip
buoyed
up
our
spirits
wonderfully
on
monday
morning
july
george
took
an
axe
and
cut
us
a
portage
route
from
our
camp
through
a
swamp
a
mile
and
a
half
to
the
foot
of
a
hill
this
route
we
covered
three
times
it
was
impossible
for
one
man
alone
to
carry
the
canoe
through
the
swamp
and
in
addition
to
it
and
the
firearms
we
had
at
this
period
to
transport
about
five
hundred
pounds
of
baggage
made
up
into
packs
of
about
pounds
each
at
first
hubbard
and
i
found
pounds
a
pretty
good
load
to
carry
and
neither
of
us
could
get
even
that
on
his
back
without
help
from
george
but
later
on
we
learned
to
back
and
carry
with
comparative
ease
a
hundred
pounds
or
more
in
packing
we
never
used
either
shoulder
or
chest
straps
relying
solely
upon
the
head
strap
which
passes
across
the
forehead
when
after
much
groaning
and
sweating
we
finally
arrived
with
all
of
our
outfit
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
it
took
the
combined
efforts
of
all
three
of
us
to
get
the
canoe
to
the
top
whence
we
followed
an
old
caribou
trail
for
a
mile
along
the
summit
camping
just
above
the
smooth
water
that
hubbard
and
george
had
seen
on
sunday
we
were
all
completely
exhausted
when
we
reached
camp
while
staggering
along
with
the
canoe
a
hundred
yards
from
the
tent
i
became
so
weak
that
i
suddenly
sank
to
the
ground
and
the
others
had
to
come
to
my
rescue
and
bring
in
the
canoe
but
the
night
was
cool
and
starry
and
we
sat
long
by
our
fire
and
talked
and
drank
pea
soup
and
tea
and
when
it
came
time
for
us
to
turn
in
to
our
soft
bed
of
fragrant
spruce
boughs
our
troubles
had
been
quite
forgotten
the
good
water
that
hubbard
and
george
thought
was
two
miles
long
shortened
down
when
we
actually
came
to
it
the
next
morning
to
less
than
half
a
mile
affording
us
only
a
meagre
opportunity
to
make
use
of
the
canoe
for
a
little
distance
we
again
bucked
the
rapids
and
then
left
the
river
for
a
rough
portage
of
a
mile
and
a
half
over
the
hills
on
the
shore
again
at
night
we
were
exhausted
but
again
we
had
a
fine
camp
on
a
point
overlooking
the
river
the
crisp
air
came
laden
with
the
perfume
of
spruce
and
balsam
on
the
surrounding
hills
the
fir
trees
were
darkly
silhouetted
against
the
sky
radiant
with
its
myriads
of
stars
the
roar
of
the
river
could
be
heard
dying
away
into
a
mere
murmur
among
the
hills
below
boys
said
hubbard
after
we
had
made
a
good
supper
of
a
mess
of
trout
i
had
caught
at
midday
this
pays
for
all
the
hard
work
undoubtedly
hubbard
was
in
fine
fettle
that
evening
and
as
we
lay
before
the
fire
with
that
delicious
feeling
of
languor
which
comes
from
conscientious
toil
he
entertained
george
and
me
with
quotations
from
his
favourite
author
kipling
while
we
puffed
comfortably
upon
our
pipes
one
verse
he
dwelt
upon
as
it
seemed
particularly
appropriate
to
our
position
it
was
when
first
under
fire
if
you
wishful
to
duck
do
look
or
take
heed
of
the
man
that
is
struck
be
thankful
you
living
and
trust
to
your
luck
and
march
to
your
front
like
a
soldier
still
in
the
awful
valley
the
next
day
wednesday
july
was
by
far
the
most
disheartening
of
our
journey
up
the
valley
of
the
susan
we
portaged
all
day
through
gullies
and
swamps
and
over
rough
ridges
covering
in
all
about
two
miles
and
a
half
all
of
us
were
overcome
by
the
hard
work
in
the
burning
sun
and
the
poisonous
bites
of
the
flies
i
was
the
most
susceptible
to
the
attacks
of
the
flies
for
ten
days
i
was
fairly
sick
from
the
poison
they
instilled
the
faces
bands
and
wrists
of
all
of
us
were
badly
swollen
and
very
sore
my
face
was
so
swollen
i
could
scarcely
see
in
the
morning
when
we
started
forward
the
temperature
was
down
to
degrees
but
at
noon
it
had
risen
to
hubbard
was
attacked
with
diarrhoea
and
i
with
vomiting
we
were
all
too
exhausted
to
eat
when
we
stopped
for
luncheon
and
lay
on
the
moss
for
an
hour
rest
with
the
tent
drawn
over
us
to
protect
us
from
the
flies
on
a
low
barren
knoll
we
cached
that
day
eighty
rounds
of
cartridges
and
rounds
of
george
marking
the
spot
with
a
circle
of
stakes
that
left
us
rounds
of
and
rounds
of
it
had
become
strictly
necessary
to
lighten
our
packs
and
we
had
begun
to
drop
odds
and
ends
every
day
in
the
afternoon
hubbard
shot
with
his
pistol
a
spruce
partridge
grouse
it
was
the
first
seen
by
us
on
the
trip
together
with
a
yellowlegs
george
had
shot
it
seasoned
a
pot
of
pea
soup
we
camped
that
night
on
a
bluff
barren
point
and
hubbard
named
it
partridge
point
in
bonour
of
our
first
bird
on
thursday
july
hubbard
lay
in
the
tent
all
day
sick
all
he
was
able
to
eat
was
some
hardtack
dipped
in
tea
at
his
request
george
and
i
scouted
for
trails
each
of
us
carried
a
rifle
and
wore
at
his
belt
a
pistol
and
a
cup
in
addition
to
the
sheath
knife
we
never
were
without
in
our
pockets
we
placed
a
package
of
pea
meal
george
started
westward
up
the
river
and
i
put
for
a
high
barren
bill
two
miles
to
the
north
as
i
climbed
the
hill
i
heard
gulls
on
the
other
side
which
told
me
water
lay
in
that
direction
and
when
i
reached
the
top
there
at
my
feet
like
a
silver
setting
in
the
dark
green
forest
lay
a
beautiful
little
lake
for
miles
and
miles
beyond
the
ridge
i
was
on
the
country
was
flat
and
covered
with
a
thick
spruce
growth
to
the
northeast
of
the
lake
at
my
feet
i
could
see
the
glimmer
of
other
water
among
the
trees
and
i
decided
to
go
on
and
investigate
in
doing
so
i
managed
to
get
myself
lost
descending
the
hill
to
the
lake
i
made
my
way
through
the
thick
spruce
growth
in
the
swamp
along
the
shore
a
splash
in
the
water
startled
me
and
soon
i
found
the
fresh
tracks
of
a
caribou
as
he
had
winded
me
i
knew
it
was
useless
to
try
to
follow
him
pressing
my
way
on
to
the
northeast
i
came
upon
another
small
lake
and
several
small
creeks
at
midday
i
built
a
fire
and
made
a
cup
of
pea
meal
porridge
while
waiting
for
my
meal
to
cook
i
read
a
letter
that
a
friend
had
given
me
in
new
york
to
be
opened
after
one
week
canoeing
in
labrador
it
was
like
a
letter
just
received
from
home
in
the
afternoon
the
sun
became
obscured
by
gathering
clouds
and
in
the
thick
underbrush
through
which
my
course
led
me
i
could
see
scarcely
twenty
yards
ahead
i
attempted
to
get
my
direction
with
the
compass
but
the
needle
would
not
respond
trusting
however
to
my
ability
to
find
my
course
without
it
i
made
my
way
on
past
two
more
lakes
a
grouse
fluttered
up
before
me
and
i
brought
it
down
with
a
pistol
shot
after
tying
it
to
my
belt
i
decided
it
was
time
to
turn
back
home
as
we
called
our
camp
and
struck
off
by
what
i
hoped
would
be
a
short
cut
through
the
swamp
then
it
was
that
i
lost
my
bearings
and
at
dusk
when
i
hoped
to
reach
the
first
lake
i
had
seen
in
the
morning
i
found
myself
on
the
shore
of
a
lake
i
had
never
seen
before
too
weary
to
cook
the
grouse
or
even
build
a
fire
and
make
a
cup
of
porridge
i
threw
myself
on
a
flat
rock
pillowed
my
head
on
the
trunk
of
a
fallen
spruce
tree
drew
a
handkerchief
over
my
face
to
keep
away
the
clouds
of
mosquitoes
and
slept
soundly
at
dawn
i
arose
built
a
fire
repaired
my
compass
and
ate
a
cup
of
porridge
i
was
not
frightened
because
with
my
compass
again
in
working
order
i
knew
i
should
have
no
difficulty
in
finding
the
river
which
must
be
somewhere
to
the
south
and
which
must
lead
me
back
to
camp
so
to
the
southward
i
took
my
course
pushing
my
way
through
thick
brush
and
over
marshes
where
the
ground
under
my
feet
went
up
and
down
like
the
waves
of
the
sea
towards
noon
i
reached
a
barren
hill
and
from
its
summit
saw
the
river
just
beyond
and
the
site
of
one
of
our
old
camping
places
that
i
knew
was
eighteen
miles
below
our
last
camp
down
to
the
shore
of
the
river
i
hurried
and
built
a
fire
for
luncheon
the
partridge
at
my
belt
had
been
torn
into
shreds
by
the
bushes
and
again
a
cup
of
porridge
had
to
serve
me
for
a
meal
it
was
dark
when
i
reached
camp
to
find
hubbard
greatly
worried
and
george
away
looking
for
me
there
had
been
some
arguments
between
hubbard
and
me
as
to
the
merits
of
our
respective
compasses
and
as
he
now
appeared
to
have
the
better
of
it
he
took
advantage
of
the
occasion
to
chaff
me
unmercifully
then
when
george
returned
they
both
had
fun
with
me
for
getting
lost
that
all
right
i
said
your
turn
hubbard
will
come
later
you
have
been
lost
yet
because
you
have
been
out
of
sight
of
camp
alone
anyway
i
just
stayed
out
for
a
quiet
evening
by
myself
my
absence
on
friday
did
not
delay
our
progress
any
for
hubbard
was
still
unable
to
travel
on
saturday
july
he
had
not
yet
fully
recovered
but
he
decided
to
push
forward
a
drizzling
rain
was
falling
as
we
started
each
of
us
carried
a
load
some
four
miles
up
the
valley
and
returned
and
then
hubbard
with
a
second
load
went
ahead
to
make
camp
while
george
and
i
with
the
remainder
of
the
baggage
endeavoured
to
drag
the
canoe
upstream
darkness
came
on
when
we
were
two
miles
below
camp
while
fording
the
river
i
was
carried
off
my
feet
by
the
current
and
nearly
swept
over
the
fall
with
a
pack
around
my
neck
then
george
and
i
left
the
canoe
on
the
bank
for
the
night
and
each
with
his
pack
proceeded
to
push
his
way
through
the
thick
willows
and
alders
and
over
the
rocks
it
was
so
dark
we
could
not
see
each
other
falling
down
constantly
and
struggling
to
our
feet
again
we
stumbled
on
through
the
pitchy
blackness
and
rain
until
suddenly
we
discerned
the
glowing
light
of
our
campfire
and
came
upon
hubbard
frying
bacon
george
and
i
were
too
tired
to
eat
we
were
glad
to
lie
down
in
our
wet
clothes
on
the
bed
of
spruce
boughs
that
was
ready
for
us
and
forget
our
troubles
in
sleep
we
rested
on
sunday
and
ate
a
partridge
i
had
shot
the
day
before
was
served
stewed
with
rice
and
bacon
for
dinner
while
for
supper
we
had
trout
that
hubbard
caught
in
the
morning
served
with
apple
sauce
and
hot
bread
this
high
living
fully
recompensed
us
for
our
hard
fight
against
nature
and
the
elements
and
once
more
full
of
hope
we
lay
down
to
sleep
in
the
morning
monday
july
hubbard
arose
with
a
feeling
of
depression
but
fair
progress
during
the
day
brightened
him
up
a
typical
fall
wind
blew
all
day
and
we
were
very
wet
and
very
cold
when
we
went
into
camp
at
night
but
with
the
coming
of
evening
the
clouds
were
driven
away
before
the
wind
affording
us
an
occasional
glimpse
of
the
new
moon
hanging
low
in
the
heavens
and
this
together
with
the
sound
of
the
river
and
the
roaring
campfire
soon
cheered
us
up
no
matter
how
weary
and
discouraged
we
were
during
the
day
our
evening
fire
invariably
brought
to
us
a
feeling
of
indescribable
happiness
a
sweet
forgetfulness
of
everything
but
the
moment
comfort
our
fire
that
monday
night
was
no
exception
to
the
general
rule
but
after
supper
while
we
were
luxuriantly
reclining
before
it
on
a
couch
of
boughs
hubbard
gave
expression
to
a
strange
feeling
that
had
been
growing
on
him
and
me
in
the
last
few
days
it
was
almost
as
if
the
solitude
were
getting
on
our
nerves
hubbard
was
munching
a
piece
of
black
chocolate
which
he
dipped
at
intervals
in
a
bit
of
sugar
held
in
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
when
he
said
it
queer
but
i
have
a
feeling
that
is
getting
stronger
from
day
to
day
that
we
are
the
only
people
left
in
the
world
have
you
fellows
experienced
any
such
feeling
yes
said
i
i
have
i
have
been
feeling
that
we
must
forever
be
alone
going
on
and
on
and
on
from
portage
to
portage
through
this
desolate
wilderness
that
it
exactly
said
hubbard
you
sort
of
feel
that
as
you
are
now
so
you
always
have
been
and
always
will
be
and
your
past
life
is
like
a
dream
and
your
friends
like
what
a
strange
sensation
it
is
have
you
felt
that
way
george
george
took
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
blew
out
a
cloud
of
tobacco
smoke
to
join
the
smoke
of
the
fire
and
spat
meditatively
over
his
shoulder
do
know
as
i
have
he
grunted
i
know
there
mighty
good
huntin
down
the
bay
and
i
been
thinkin
of
rupert
house
the
hudson
bay
company
post
on
james
bay
where
he
was
born
and
what
the
fellus
i
know
there
are
doin
these
days
i
ca
say
they
seem
like
to
me
they
real
enough
all
right
hubbard
and
i
laughed
solitude
was
an
old
story
to
our
friend
the
and
our
feelings
must
have
seemed
to
him
highly
artificial
if
not
affected
our
progress
on
tuesday
and
wednesday
july
and
was
the
old
story
of
hard
tracking
in
the
river
and
difficult
portaging
the
weather
was
cloudy
and
a
chill
wind
blew
on
tuesday
we
advanced
our
camp
a
little
more
than
three
miles
and
on
wednesday
a
little
more
than
four
this
continued
slow
work
gave
hubbard
serious
concern
and
the
condition
of
our
larder
and
wardrobe
was
not
reassuring
our
bacon
and
sugar
were
going
fast
fish
had
become
an
absolute
necessity
and
our
catches
had
been
alarmingly
small
there
was
also
a
lamentable
lack
of
game
far
below
we
had
heard
the
chatter
of
the
last
red
squirrel
and
seen
the
last
bear
signs
and
the
last
tree
barked
by
porcupines
there
were
caribou
trails
but
seldom
a
fresh
track
a
solitary
rabbit
had
crossed
our
trail
since
we
entered
the
valley
and
there
were
no
more
rabbit
runs
visible
we
could
only
hope
that
as
we
neared
the
height
of
land
we
should
find
more
game
find
plenty
of
caribou
at
least
on
the
barrens
we
had
also
noted
a
change
in
the
timber
growth
neither
birch
nor
aspen
had
we
seen
for
a
week
our
moccasins
were
breaking
through
the
bottoms
and
this
was
a
serious
matter
for
while
george
had
an
extra
pair
hubbard
and
i
had
only
those
on
our
feet
hubbard
feet
were
very
sore
two
of
his
toe
nails
came
off
on
wednesday
night
and
a
wide
crack
which
must
have
made
walking
very
painful
appeared
in
one
of
his
heels
the
nearest
thing
we
had
to
adhesive
plaster
was
electrician
tape
and
with
this
he
bandaged
his
heel
and
tied
it
and
his
toes
up
with
pieces
of
cotton
rags
we
had
brought
for
cleaning
rifles
it
was
on
thursday
july
that
we
reached
the
point
where
another
stream
comes
into
the
susan
or
where
the
river
may
be
said
to
divide
into
two
branches
we
found
that
the
southerly
branch
came
over
a
low
fall
from
the
west
while
the
other
or
northerly
branch
flowed
down
from
the
northwest
the
southerly
branch
was
fully
as
large
as
the
northerly
narrower
but
deeper
and
not
nearly
so
swift
and
rocky
we
were
very
uncertain
as
to
which
branch
to
follow
and
hubbard
sent
george
on
a
scouting
trip
up
the
southerly
stream
which
we
shall
call
goose
creek
while
he
himself
climbed
a
knoll
to
get
a
look
at
the
country
a
half
mile
or
so
up
goose
creek
george
found
a
blaze
crossing
the
stream
from
north
to
south
which
he
pronounced
a
winter
blaze
made
by
trappers
as
the
cuttings
were
high
up
on
the
trees
and
freshly
made
half
a
mile
above
the
blaze
george
came
upon
the
rotten
poles
of
an
old
indian
wigwam
and
this
discovery
made
hubbard
happy
he
accepted
it
as
evidence
that
goose
creek
was
the
river
mapped
as
the
northwest
and
the
indian
route
to
michikamau
accordingly
it
was
decided
to
follow
the
southerly
branch
and
to
leave
the
main
stream
at
this
point
i
was
glad
to
leave
the
valley
of
the
susan
our
whole
course
up
the
valley
had
been
torturous
and
disheartening
we
had
been
out
fifteen
days
from
northwest
river
post
and
had
covered
only
eighty
miles
hubbard
had
been
ill
and
i
had
been
ill
always
as
we
pressed
onward
i
dreaded
the
prospect
of
retracing
our
steps
through
the
susan
valley
i
hated
the
valley
from
end
to
end
i
have
more
reason
to
hate
it
now
to
me
it
is
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
vi
searching
for
a
trail
when
we
portaged
into
goose
creek
on
friday
july
hubbard
had
quite
recovered
from
his
illness
i
too
was
well
again
and
our
appetites
had
returned
it
is
true
that
my
legs
and
feet
were
much
swollen
from
the
continuous
work
in
the
cold
river
but
the
swelling
caused
me
no
inconvenience
all
of
us
in
fact
were
in
better
shape
for
the
fight
against
the
wild
than
at
any
time
since
the
start
for
three
or
four
miles
up
goose
creek
the
rapids
were
almost
continuous
and
we
had
to
portage
for
practically
the
whole
of
the
distance
on
august
and
the
weather
was
cold
with
a
raw
wind
and
a
continuous
downpour
of
rain
at
night
the
rain
kept
up
a
steady
drop
drop
drop
through
our
tent
on
the
owing
to
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
we
did
not
travel
but
the
morning
of
the
brought
brilliant
sunshine
and
with
the
perfume
of
the
forest
in
our
nostrils
we
pushed
on
soon
reaching
a
flatter
and
a
marshy
country
where
the
creek
deepened
and
narrowed
with
a
sluggish
current
here
the
paddling
was
good
and
for
a
little
way
we
made
rapid
progress
in
this
marshy
stretch
by
the
creek
bank
we
saw
a
beaver
house
and
george
stepped
out
of
the
canoe
to
examine
it
they
livin
here
he
remarked
if
we
not
too
far
away
when
we
camp
i
comin
down
with
a
rifle
and
watch
for
they
come
out
to
play
in
the
water
in
the
evenin
and
it
not
hard
to
get
what
the
use
of
killing
them
i
asked
what
could
you
do
with
a
beaver
if
you
got
him
i
cook
it
and
we
have
a
good
snack
of
beaver
meat
said
george
they
the
finest
kind
of
eatin
and
i
go
a
good
way
for
a
piece
of
beaver
tail
it
nice
and
greasy
and
better
than
anything
you
ever
ate
as
we
paddled
on
george
continued
to
extol
the
virtues
of
beaver
meat
expatiating
on
many
a
good
snack
of
it
that
he
had
consumed
however
he
did
not
return
to
the
beaver
house
for
more
important
things
that
evening
claimed
our
attention
it
was
on
this
day
that
we
reached
a
point
where
our
branch
creek
itself
separated
into
two
branches
upon
scouting
them
we
discovered
that
each
of
these
branches
had
for
its
origin
a
lake
the
two
bodies
of
water
from
which
they
flowed
being
close
together
some
three
miles
to
the
westward
apparently
they
were
small
lakes
but
we
hoped
to
find
that
they
belonged
to
a
chain
that
would
carry
us
into
the
country
and
their
discovery
encouraged
us
to
push
on
this
hope
was
strengthened
by
indian
wigwam
poles
that
we
found
in
the
vicinity
the
poles
it
is
true
were
old
indicating
that
the
indians
had
not
been
there
for
several
years
but
as
it
had
been
a
long
time
since
they
had
ceased
to
visit
regularly
northwest
river
post
we
thought
we
had
reason
to
believe
that
the
poles
marked
what
had
been
a
permanent
trail
rather
than
the
course
of
a
hunting
expedition
hubbard
was
particularly
observant
of
these
old
indian
signs
he
was
anxious
to
find
them
and
delighted
when
he
did
find
them
here
are
the
signs
he
would
say
we
are
on
the
right
trail
but
we
were
not
on
the
right
trail
the
right
trail
the
nascaupee
route
was
miles
to
the
northward
we
eventually
did
stumble
upon
a
trail
to
michikamau
but
it
was
another
one
a
very
old
one
and
we
found
it
only
to
lose
it
again
while
we
were
following
up
goose
creek
the
condition
of
our
commissariat
troubled
us
not
a
little
the
scarcity
of
game
had
forced
us
to
draw
heavily
upon
our
stores
only
a
little
of
our
lard
and
a
small
part
of
our
pounds
of
bacon
remained
we
must
hustle
for
grub
boys
hubbard
frequently
remarked
our
diet
excepting
on
particular
occasions
was
bread
and
tea
fish
when
we
could
get
them
and
sometimes
a
little
pea
soup
the
pea
meal
plain
and
flavoured
was
originally
intended
as
a
sort
of
emergency
ration
but
we
had
drawn
on
our
stock
of
it
alarmingly
our
flour
too
was
going
rapidly
and
the
time
was
drawing
near
when
we
felt
that
the
ration
of
bread
must
be
cut
down
the
only
thing
perhaps
that
we
really
craved
was
fresh
meat
for
several
days
after
leaving
the
post
we
had
experienced
a
decided
craving
for
acids
but
that
craving
had
been
partially
satisfied
when
on
the
barren
hills
that
border
the
valley
of
the
susan
we
found
a
few
cranberries
that
had
survived
the
winter
every
day
while
we
were
on
goose
creek
we
caught
a
few
small
trout
when
we
halted
for
any
purpose
hubbard
always
whipped
the
stream
he
was
a
tireless
as
well
as
an
expert
fisherman
he
would
fish
long
after
i
had
become
discouraged
and
catch
them
in
pools
where
they
positively
refused
to
rise
for
me
the
trout
thus
obtained
were
relished
but
a
fish
diet
is
not
strengthening
neither
is
it
satisfying
and
as
we
had
had
no
fresh
meat
since
the
day
we
landed
at
indian
harbour
a
month
before
our
longing
for
it
had
become
importunate
imagine
our
joy
then
when
on
august
the
day
we
discovered
the
petering
out
of
goose
creek
some
fresh
meat
came
our
way
most
unexpectedly
was
the
day
turned
into
one
of
feasting
and
thanksgiving
as
we
were
preparing
soon
after
passing
the
beaver
house
to
pack
at
the
foot
of
a
rapid
just
below
a
little
pond
expansion
hubbard
saw
four
geese
swimming
slowly
down
the
stream
he
and
george
had
just
lifted
their
packs
from
the
canoe
while
i
some
little
distance
off
had
mine
on
my
back
hubbard
had
his
rifle
in
his
hands
george
who
caught
sight
of
the
geese
almost
as
soon
as
hubbard
grabbed
my
rifle
from
the
canoe
drop
cried
hubbard
and
down
we
all
fell
behind
the
little
bank
over
which
the
birds
had
been
sighted
there
was
fresh
meat
swimming
towards
us
and
while
we
lay
waiting
for
it
to
come
in
sight
around
the
little
head
of
land
the
excitement
was
intense
soon
the
leader
appeared
and
hubbard
and
george
fired
almost
simultaneously
if
ever
there
was
a
goose
that
had
his
goose
cooked
it
was
that
poor
unfortunate
leader
one
of
the
bullets
from
the
rifles
that
were
aimed
at
him
went
through
his
neck
cutting
the
bone
clean
and
leaving
his
head
hanging
by
two
little
bits
of
skin
the
other
bullet
bored
a
hole
through
his
body
breaking
both
wings
i
did
not
blame
him
when
he
keeled
over
the
leader
disposed
of
hubbard
and
george
again
fired
in
quick
succession
and
two
of
the
other
geese
dropped
just
as
they
were
turning
back
upstream
and
vainly
trying
to
rise
on
their
wings
which
were
useless
so
soon
after
the
moulting
season
the
second
shot
emptied
george
rifle
he
threw
it
down
grabbed
a
paddle
and
went
after
one
of
the
birds
which
only
slightly
wounded
was
flopping
about
in
the
water
meanwhile
hubbard
had
fired
twice
at
the
fourth
goose
and
missed
both
times
his
rifle
also
being
empty
now
he
cast
it
aside
seized
his
pistol
ran
around
the
bank
and
jumped
into
the
water
in
time
to
head
off
the
remaining
goose
as
it
was
flopping
upstream
that
brought
the
goose
between
him
and
george
and
the
bird
was
so
bewildered
that
hubbard
had
time
to
fire
at
him
twice
with
his
pistol
and
kill
him
while
george
effectually
disposed
of
the
wounded
goose
by
swatting
him
over
the
head
with
the
paddle
thus
all
four
birds
were
ours
and
our
exultation
knew
no
bounds
we
shouted
we
threw
our
hats
in
the
air
and
shouted
again
lifting
the
birds
critically
we
estimated
that
we
had
on
hand
about
fifty
pounds
of
goose
meat
more
luck
came
to
us
that
same
day
when
we
halted
for
luncheon
at
the
foot
of
some
rapid
water
as
soon
as
we
stopped
hubbard
as
usual
cast
a
fly
and
almost
immediately
landed
a
trout
then
as
fast
as
i
could
split
them
and
george
fry
them
another
and
another
all
big
ones
fell
a
victim
to
his
skill
the
result
was
that
we
had
all
the
trout
we
could
eat
that
noon
and
we
ate
a
good
many
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
we
reached
the
point
where
the
two
brooks
joined
to
form
goose
creek
our
scouting
was
finished
in
less
than
two
hours
and
we
went
into
camp
early
for
as
hubbard
expressed
it
we
were
to
have
a
heap
big
feed
and
george
reminded
us
that
it
would
take
a
good
while
to
roast
a
goose
our
camp
was
pitched
at
the
foot
of
a
ridge
a
above
the
junction
of
the
brooks
george
built
a
big
fire
much
bigger
than
usual
at
the
back
he
placed
the
largest
green
log
he
could
find
just
in
front
of
the
fire
and
at
each
side
he
fixed
a
forked
stake
and
on
these
rested
a
cross
pole
from
the
centre
of
the
pole
he
suspended
a
piece
of
stout
twine
which
reached
nearly
to
the
ground
and
tied
the
lower
end
into
a
noose
then
it
was
that
the
goose
nicely
prepared
for
cooking
was
brought
forth
through
it
at
the
wings
george
stuck
a
sharp
wooden
pin
leaving
the
ends
to
protrude
on
each
side
through
the
legs
he
stuck
a
similar
pin
in
a
similar
fashion
this
being
done
he
slipped
the
noose
at
the
end
of
the
twine
over
the
ends
of
one
of
the
pins
and
lo
and
behold
the
goose
was
suspended
before
the
fire
it
hung
low
just
high
enough
to
permit
the
placing
of
a
dish
under
it
to
catch
the
gravy
now
and
then
george
gave
it
a
twirl
so
that
none
of
its
sides
might
have
reason
to
complain
at
not
receiving
its
share
of
the
heat
the
lower
end
roasted
first
seeing
which
george
took
the
goose
off
reversed
it
and
set
it
twirling
again
after
a
time
he
sharpened
a
sliver
of
wood
stuck
it
into
the
goose
and
examined
the
wound
critically
smells
like
a
christmas
goose
when
one
goes
through
the
kitchen
dead
hungry
before
dinner
said
hubbard
i
commented
in
a
little
while
george
tried
the
sharp
splinter
again
hubbard
and
i
watched
him
anxiously
white
juice
followed
the
stick
two
hours
had
passed
and
the
goose
was
done
events
now
came
crowding
thick
and
fast
first
george
put
the
steaming
brown
goose
in
his
mixing
basin
and
deftly
and
rapidly
disjointed
it
with
his
sheath
knife
meanwhile
with
nervous
haste
hubbard
and
i
had
drawn
our
knives
and
with
the
tin
basin
of
goose
before
us
all
three
of
us
plumped
down
in
a
on
the
thick
moss
in
the
light
of
the
fire
many
of
the
rules
of
etiquette
were
waived
we
stood
not
on
the
order
of
our
falling
to
but
fell
to
at
once
we
eat
and
we
eat
at
first
ravenously
then
more
slowly
with
his
mouth
full
of
the
succulent
bird
george
allowed
he
would
rather
have
goose
than
caribou
i
prefer
goose
to
anything
else
said
he
and
proceeded
to
tell
us
of
goose
hunts
down
the
bay
and
of
divers
big
indian
feasts
at
length
all
the
goose
was
gone
but
one
very
small
piece
i
eat
that
for
a
snack
before
i
sleep
said
george
as
he
started
to
put
the
giblets
to
stew
for
breakfast
the
fire
died
down
until
nothing
remained
save
a
heap
of
glowing
embers
for
a
long
time
we
sat
in
the
darkness
over
an
extra
pot
of
tea
at
first
silence
and
then
while
george
and
i
puffed
complacently
on
our
pipes
hubbard
who
never
smoked
entertained
us
with
more
of
kipling
the
feet
of
the
young
men
was
one
of
his
favourites
and
that
night
he
put
more
than
his
usual
feeling
into
the
words
now
the
lodge
is
opened
now
the
hunting
winds
are
loose
now
the
smokes
of
spring
go
up
to
clear
the
brain
now
the
young
men
hearts
are
troubled
for
the
whisper
of
the
trues
now
the
red
gods
make
their
medicine
again
who
hath
seen
the
beaver
busied
who
hath
watched
the
mating
who
hath
lain
alone
to
hear
the
cry
who
hath
worked
the
chosen
water
where
the
ouananiche
is
waiting
or
the
jumping
crazy
for
the
fly
he
must
go
go
go
away
from
here
on
the
other
side
the
world
he
overdue
your
road
is
clear
before
you
when
the
old
comes
you
and
the
red
gods
call
for
you
again
the
silence
the
northern
lights
flashed
and
swept
in
fantastic
shapes
across
the
sky
illuminating
the
fir
tops
in
the
valley
and
making
the
white
lichens
gleam
on
the
barren
hill
above
us
we
thought
of
the
lake
ahead
with
its
old
wigwams
and
the
promise
it
held
out
of
an
easy
trail
to
michikamau
made
us
feel
sure
that
the
worst
part
of
our
journey
was
ended
thus
we
sat
supremely
happy
and
content
until
long
past
midnight
when
we
went
to
our
tent
and
our
bed
of
fragrant
spruce
boughs
to
be
lulled
asleep
by
the
murmuring
waters
of
the
creek
below
the
brooks
into
which
goose
creek
divided
near
our
camp
of
course
would
not
permit
of
canoeing
and
the
morning
after
our
feast
august
we
portaged
through
a
swamp
into
the
lake
that
fed
the
southerly
one
we
called
this
small
body
of
water
mountaineer
lake
because
the
mountaineer
indians
had
been
there
besides
numerous
cuttings
and
the
remains
of
wigwams
we
found
the
ruins
of
a
drying
stage
where
they
had
cured
meat
or
fish
from
goose
camp
to
the
lake
shore
george
carried
the
canoe
and
hubbard
and
i
each
a
pack
then
while
george
and
i
returned
for
the
remaining
packs
hubbard
waited
by
the
lake
as
he
sat
there
alone
a
caribou
waded
into
the
water
less
than
a
hundred
feet
away
stopped
and
looked
fearlessly
at
him
for
a
few
moments
and
then
walked
leisurely
off
into
the
woods
it
seemed
as
if
he
wanted
to
shake
hands
with
me
hubbard
said
when
he
told
us
of
the
incident
he
had
to
let
the
deer
depart
in
peace
because
both
rifles
were
back
with
the
last
loads
at
goose
camp
and
his
pistol
was
in
his
bag
needless
to
say
we
were
bitterly
disappointed
at
losing
the
first
deer
we
had
seen
and
it
taught
us
the
lesson
always
to
take
one
rifle
forward
with
the
first
load
on
a
portage
we
spent
the
afternoon
scouting
in
different
directions
and
discovered
that
the
only
inlet
to
mountaineer
lake
ended
in
a
bog
a
mile
or
so
up
a
mile
or
more
to
the
westward
however
george
discovered
another
and
much
larger
lake
which
in
honour
of
him
we
shall
call
lake
elson
an
old
trail
led
from
mountaineer
lake
to
lake
elson
which
george
pronounced
to
be
a
caribou
trail
but
which
hubbard
believed
to
be
an
old
portage
because
it
led
from
lake
to
lake
by
the
most
direct
course
there
were
no
axe
cuttings
however
to
indicate
that
the
indians
had
followed
it
we
tried
the
troll
in
mountaineer
lake
but
caught
nothing
apparently
there
was
nothing
there
but
trout
of
which
fish
i
caught
eight
at
the
inlet
i
shot
with
my
pistol
a
muskrat
that
was
swimming
in
the
lake
but
george
did
not
cook
it
as
he
said
the
flesh
would
be
too
strong
at
that
season
it
was
raining
again
and
the
mosquitoes
were
out
in
millions
but
with
three
geese
still
on
hand
and
a
good
lake
ahead
we
were
indifferent
to
such
troubles
as
that
although
our
clothing
was
not
now
in
a
condition
successfully
to
withstand
much
bad
weather
rags
in
fact
were
beginning
to
appear
upon
us
all
one
of
trousers
legs
was
ripped
clear
down
the
front
and
it
was
continually
streaming
behind
in
the
wind
and
getting
caught
in
the
bushes
despite
his
efforts
to
keep
it
in
place
with
pieces
of
twine
at
length
he
patched
it
with
a
piece
of
white
duffel
and
exhibited
his
tailoring
feat
to
us
with
much
pride
about
noon
on
august
after
a
portage
we
reached
lake
elson
on
the
way
hubbard
sighted
two
caribou
he
dropped
his
pack
and
grabbed
his
rifle
they
were
yards
away
and
partially
hidden
by
the
timber
and
as
they
were
approaching
him
he
waited
believing
he
would
get
a
better
shot
but
while
he
was
waiting
what
he
called
a
cussed
little
bird
scared
them
off
by
giving
a
sharp
shrill
cry
of
alarm
which
the
deer
evidently
were
clever
enough
to
construe
as
meaning
that
something
out
of
the
ordinary
was
happening
lake
elson
proved
to
be
about
three
and
a
half
miles
long
and
a
half
mile
wide
it
lay
in
a
basin
surrounded
by
wooded
hills
the
northerly
portion
was
dotted
with
low
islands
of
drift
with
two
or
three
irregular
rocky
islands
all
completely
wooded
it
was
a
beautiful
sheet
of
water
and
like
all
the
lakes
in
labrador
as
clear
as
crystal
and
very
cold
on
the
northerly
side
there
were
narrow
straits
and
inlets
doubtless
connecting
the
lake
with
others
to
the
northwest
that
were
hidden
by
the
growth
the
outlet
was
at
the
southern
end
it
flowed
through
a
pass
in
a
low
ridge
of
hills
that
extended
for
a
great
distance
east
and
west
and
emptied
into
a
small
lake
the
waters
of
which
were
discharged
through
a
creek
that
flowed
through
a
pass
in
another
low
ridge
that
ran
parallel
with
the
first
as
far
as
we
could
see
between
the
two
ridges
was
a
marsh
that
extended
westward
for
many
miles
the
ridges
and
the
hills
surrounding
the
lakes
were
covered
with
spruce
and
balsam
nowhere
along
our
route
since
we
left
northwest
river
post
however
had
we
seen
any
timber
of
commercial
value
the
largest
trees
did
not
exceed
eight
inches
in
diameter
the
generality
being
much
smaller
we
were
somewhat
disconcerted
upon
finding
no
further
signs
of
indians
and
feared
we
had
lost
the
trail
neither
trapper
blaze
nor
trapper
cutting
was
to
be
seen
for
now
we
were
beyond
their
zone
and
in
a
country
that
apparently
no
white
man
and
no
breed
had
ever
viewed
we
selected
a
site
for
our
camp
near
the
outlet
at
the
southern
end
of
the
lake
in
the
afternoon
hubbard
and
george
went
to
some
bluffs
that
could
be
seen
two
or
three
miles
to
the
southward
to
scout
for
a
route
to
michikamau
and
find
the
indian
trail
if
possible
i
remained
behind
to
make
camp
the
days
were
now
shortening
rapidly
it
was
dark
before
eight
in
the
grey
of
the
twilight
george
returned
when
he
hailed
me
i
was
fishing
in
the
outlet
just
below
the
camp
standing
on
a
rock
in
midstream
to
which
i
had
waded
come
up
to
camp
he
called
once
in
the
wilderness
we
made
no
distinctions
as
to
master
and
servant
we
were
all
companions
together
hence
george
familiar
manner
of
address
when
i
land
two
more
trout
i
shouted
back
you
got
enough
come
now
he
pleaded
there
was
that
in
his
tone
that
excited
my
curiosity
he
seemed
all
of
a
sudden
to
have
acquired
an
unusual
fondness
for
my
society
what
the
matter
george
i
asked
i
been
about
lost
he
returned
come
on
and
i
tell
you
i
was
astonished
i
had
seen
george
drop
a
pack
in
the
bush
where
everything
for
miles
around
looked
alike
to
me
and
without
marking
the
spot
or
apparently
taking
note
of
any
guiding
signs
he
would
go
directly
to
it
again
i
was
with
him
one
night
when
he
left
a
pack
among
alders
and
willows
in
the
depth
of
a
marsh
and
in
the
morning
he
went
back
two
miles
straight
to
the
very
spot
how
a
man
that
could
do
this
could
get
lost
was
beyond
my
understanding
i
hurried
up
to
camp
how
did
it
happen
george
i
asked
i
just
got
turned
he
replied
i
did
have
any
grub
and
i
did
have
a
pistol
or
a
fishhook
or
any
way
to
get
grub
and
i
did
have
a
compass
and
i
was
scared
but
do
you
know
how
you
got
lost
i
persisted
no
i
do
said
george
i
just
got
lost
but
i
found
myself
pretty
quick
i
never
got
lost
before
the
only
way
i
could
account
for
it
was
that
he
had
permitted
his
thoughts
to
wander
i
asked
him
what
he
would
have
done
if
he
had
not
been
able
to
find
his
way
back
gone
to
the
highest
hill
i
could
see
he
answered
with
a
grin
and
made
the
biggest
smoke
i
could
make
at
its
top
and
waited
for
you
fellus
to
find
me
while
we
were
talking
george
was
busily
engaged
in
making
the
fire
putting
a
goose
to
boil
and
preparing
water
for
tea
the
twilight
deepened
and
ere
we
realised
it
darkness
had
come
every
moment
we
expected
to
hear
hubbard
but
he
did
not
appear
another
man
lost
said
i
with
a
forced
lightness
that
illy
concealed
the
anxiety
george
and
i
both
felt
we
knew
that
hubbard
not
only
had
nothing
to
eat
but
no
matches
to
make
a
fire
frequently
we
stopped
our
work
and
talk
to
peer
into
the
gathering
night
and
listen
for
the
breaking
of
a
twig
at
length
i
took
my
rifle
and
fired
at
intervals
half
a
dozen
shots
but
the
reports
echoed
and
died
away
without
a
reply
a
damp
north
wind
chilled
the
air
and
the
gloom
seemed
particularly
oppressive
hubbard
will
have
a
hard
night
out
there
in
the
bush
said
george
yes
i
replied
i
do
suppose
we
can
expect
him
back
now
before
morning
and
when
a
man
is
lost
in
this
wild
country
it
pretty
hard
to
find
a
little
tent
all
by
itself
i
was
thinking
of
my
own
experience
farther
back
and
what
might
happen
should
hubbard
fail
to
find
us
or
we
him
he
was
not
so
fortunate
as
i
had
been
in
that
there
was
no
river
to
guide
his
return
however
at
five
in
the
morning
he
appeared
he
had
spent
a
miserable
night
on
a
ridge
two
miles
to
the
southward
wet
and
shivering
with
no
fire
and
tormented
by
mosquitoes
he
reported
that
from
the
ridge
he
could
hear
the
roar
of
a
rapid
darkness
had
prevented
him
from
going
on
and
he
had
not
seen
the
rapid
but
he
was
sure
it
was
a
part
of
a
big
river
at
first
he
was
loath
to
admit
he
had
been
lost
doubtless
remembering
how
he
and
george
had
guyed
me
when
i
had
been
out
all
night
and
my
prediction
that
his
turn
would
come
but
when
george
confessed
to
having
gone
astray
also
he
made
a
clean
breast
of
it
telling
us
he
was
lost
good
and
plenty
and
scared
some
too
now
i
had
my
innings
and
i
must
confess
i
took
great
delight
in
returning
some
of
the
chaff
they
had
given
me
hubbard
decreed
in
consequence
of
these
experiences
getting
lost
that
thereafter
each
man
at
all
times
should
have
on
his
person
an
emergency
kit
to
consist
of
matches
a
piece
of
fish
line
some
hooks
and
two
or
three
flies
enclosed
in
a
film
box
waterproofed
with
electrician
tape
we
remained
in
our
camp
on
lake
elson
for
two
days
in
order
to
scout
and
dry
fish
it
was
the
best
fishing
place
we
had
yet
come
to
during
our
stay
we
had
all
the
trout
we
could
eat
and
we
dried
and
smoked
large
ones
the
scouting
proved
that
hubbard
big
river
was
an
important
discovery
it
lay
two
miles
to
the
south
of
us
flowing
to
the
southeast
hubbard
sent
george
to
look
at
it
and
he
reported
that
it
certainly
came
from
large
lakes
as
it
was
big
deep
and
straight
could
it
come
from
lake
michikamau
while
george
was
away
hubbard
and
i
took
a
trip
in
the
canoe
around
the
lake
and
through
some
inlets
at
the
northeast
we
discovered
a
creek
flowing
into
the
lake
and
as
there
were
some
old
indian
wigwams
and
cuttings
near
it
indicating
the
possibility
of
its
being
part
of
a
trail
we
seriously
considered
the
advisability
of
following
it
up
from
a
knoll
near
by
we
could
see
to
the
northwest
other
lakes
into
which
the
creek
might
possibly
lead
us
but
after
returning
to
camp
we
considered
the
situation
fully
in
the
light
of
george
report
of
the
big
river
and
we
decided
that
to
the
big
river
we
should
go
this
decision
was
not
to
prove
an
error
of
judgment
for
the
big
river
was
none
other
than
the
beaver
an
important
part
of
an
old
trail
of
the
indians
to
lake
michikamau
vii
on
a
real
river
at
last
we
broke
camp
in
the
forenoon
of
august
and
a
few
hours
later
after
making
two
trips
back
and
forth
we
arrived
with
our
baggage
on
the
bank
of
our
new
river
at
last
we
had
a
real
river
to
travel
on
its
average
width
being
between
and
yards
none
of
us
of
course
then
knew
that
our
real
river
was
the
beaver
and
that
in
taking
to
it
we
had
stumbled
upon
an
old
indian
route
to
lake
michikamau
if
we
had
known
this
it
would
have
made
a
great
difference
in
our
fortunes
immediately
below
the
point
where
we
portaged
into
the
river
wooded
ridges
on
either
side
hugged
it
close
forming
a
narrow
valley
just
above
us
the
valley
broadened
and
a
mile
or
so
up
a
big
hill
reared
its
barren
summit
above
the
black
spruce
trees
at
its
base
standing
there
like
a
lonely
sentinel
among
the
little
hills
that
bordered
the
widening
river
basin
despite
the
fact
that
we
had
reached
a
real
river
we
still
had
rapids
to
encounter
and
we
had
to
make
so
many
short
portages
that
after
we
had
ascended
the
river
two
miles
it
was
time
to
camp
we
pitched
our
tent
on
a
rising
plateau
just
below
a
stretch
of
rushing
water
as
soon
as
we
stopped
hubbard
tried
to
fish
and
while
i
made
camp
he
landed
fifteen
trout
averaging
nearly
half
a
pound
each
they
were
most
welcome
as
the
time
had
come
when
we
had
to
live
off
the
country
our
bread
ration
was
now
cut
down
to
of
a
loaf
a
day
for
each
man
as
we
had
no
lard
it
was
made
simply
of
flour
baking
powder
and
water
it
was
baked
in
our
frying
pan
and
a
loaf
was
about
eight
inches
in
diameter
and
one
inch
thick
so
that
our
daily
ration
was
but
a
morsel
we
also
decided
that
from
now
on
we
should
use
pea
meal
only
on
rare
occasions
and
to
reserve
our
other
provisions
with
the
exception
of
a
few
dried
apples
tea
coffee
and
a
little
chocolate
and
cocoa
to
give
us
a
start
should
we
at
any
time
find
it
necessary
to
make
a
sudden
dash
for
the
post
our
clothing
was
rapidly
disintegrating
the
front
of
trouser
leg
was
all
torn
open
again
and
once
more
he
had
to
resort
to
pieces
of
twine
we
had
frequent
discussions
at
this
period
as
to
whose
appearance
was
the
most
beautiful
for
a
time
hubbard
and
i
would
claim
the
distinction
each
for
himself
but
it
usually
ended
by
our
conceding
the
distinction
to
george
as
a
matter
of
fact
with
our
unkempt
hair
and
beards
and
our
rags
we
now
formed
as
tough
looking
a
party
of
tramps
as
ever
came
down
the
pike
that
night
in
camp
i
cut
up
my
canvas
leggings
and
used
pieces
of
the
canvas
to
rebottom
my
moccasins
sewing
it
on
with
shoemaker
thread
it
was
a
glorious
evening
a
big
moon
rising
over
the
bluffs
beyond
us
transformed
the
river
into
a
silvery
thread
stretching
far
down
through
the
dark
valley
behind
us
the
black
spruce
forest
made
our
roaring
fire
seem
more
cheerful
in
contrast
a
cold
east
wind
had
driven
away
the
flies
and
the
mosquitoes
supper
eaten
our
cup
of
contentment
was
full
to
the
brim
after
all
the
wilderness
was
not
so
inhospitable
who
would
be
anywhere
else
if
he
could
not
one
of
us
with
the
sensation
that
we
were
the
only
people
in
labrador
a
fancy
struck
me
and
i
suggested
to
my
companions
that
we
ought
to
organise
some
sort
of
government
we
make
you
hubbard
i
said
the
head
of
the
nation
and
call
you
the
great
mogul
of
course
you
will
be
of
the
army
and
navy
and
have
unlimited
power
we
your
subjects
i
suspect
replied
hubbard
you
are
looking
for
a
political
job
however
i
of
course
stand
ready
like
our
politicians
at
home
to
serve
the
country
when
duty
calls
if
there
enough
in
it
as
the
great
mogul
of
labrador
i
appoint
you
wallace
chief
justice
and
also
secretary
of
state
george
i
shall
appoint
admiral
of
the
navy
where
are
my
ships
asked
george
ships
exclaimed
hubbard
well
there
will
be
only
one
for
the
present
but
she
a
good
staunch
one
eighteen
feet
long
with
a
beam
of
and
a
half
inches
and
she
carries
two
rifles
with
these
and
other
conceits
we
whiled
away
the
beautiful
evening
hours
what
a
difference
there
was
in
the
morning
we
awoke
it
was
saturday
august
to
find
that
the
east
wind
had
increased
in
force
and
was
accompanied
by
a
driving
chilling
rain
reluctantly
we
broke
camp
and
began
a
day
of
disheartening
work
the
wind
soughed
dismally
through
the
forests
and
it
was
as
though
late
autumn
had
overtaken
us
in
a
night
the
spruce
boughs
watersoaked
seemed
to
hang
low
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
strike
us
in
the
face
at
every
step
and
the
willows
and
alders
along
the
river
that
now
and
again
obstructed
our
way
appeared
to
be
thicker
and
wetter
than
ever
under
these
conditions
we
had
made
six
portages
the
longest
of
which
was
about
of
a
mile
and
covered
in
all
about
four
and
a
half
miles
when
one
came
and
we
gave
up
the
fight
for
the
day
to
make
our
sunday
camp
and
try
to
get
fish
we
were
ravenously
hungry
and
ate
even
the
heads
of
the
dried
trout
we
had
for
luncheon
these
being
the
last
of
those
we
caught
and
smoked
on
lake
elson
during
the
afternoon
we
put
out
for
the
first
time
the
old
gill
net
mackenzie
had
given
us
and
by
hard
work
with
the
rod
caught
a
few
more
trout
for
supper
it
still
poured
on
sunday
morning
hubbard
fished
all
day
and
i
the
greater
part
of
the
forenoon
the
net
product
of
our
labor
was
trout
most
of
them
little
fellows
the
gill
net
yielded
us
nothing
in
the
afternoon
george
and
i
took
the
rifles
and
started
out
in
different
directions
to
look
for
caribou
neither
of
us
found
any
fresh
tracks
i
returned
at
dusk
to
find
george
already
in
camp
and
our
supper
of
boiled
fish
ready
to
be
eaten
our
sugar
was
all
gone
by
this
time
and
our
supply
of
salt
was
so
low
that
we
were
using
hardly
any
in
spite
of
us
the
salt
had
been
wet
in
the
drenching
rains
we
had
encountered
all
up
the
susan
valley
and
a
large
part
of
it
had
dissolved
while
we
all
craved
sugar
and
other
sweets
i
believe
hubbard
suffered
the
most
from
their
absence
perhaps
the
fact
that
george
and
i
used
tobacco
and
he
did
not
was
the
explanation
he
was
continually
discussing
the
merits
of
various
kinds
of
cake
candies
and
sweet
things
generally
our
conversation
too
often
turned
to
new
york
restaurants
and
how
he
would
visit
various
ones
of
them
for
particular
dishes
bread
undoubtedly
was
what
we
craved
the
most
i
believe
i
never
refuse
bread
again
hubbard
would
say
so
long
as
a
bit
on
the
table
monday
august
brought
with
it
no
abatement
of
the
driving
rain
and
cold
east
wind
working
industriously
for
half
an
hour
before
breakfast
hubbard
succeeded
in
landing
a
single
small
trout
which
fell
to
me
while
he
and
george
ate
thick
pea
meal
porridge
of
which
they
were
very
fond
we
made
several
short
portages
during
the
morning
and
despite
the
dismal
weather
our
spirits
brightened
for
we
came
upon
old
wigwam
poles
and
axe
cuttings
which
we
accepted
as
proof
that
we
were
now
surely
on
the
indian
trail
to
michikamau
towards
noon
hubbard
said
well
boys
we
on
the
right
road
we
covered
three
miles
this
morning
and
this
rain
is
killing
so
we
pitch
camp
now
and
wait
for
the
weather
to
clear
and
try
to
get
some
fish
ahead
there
are
fish
here
i
know
and
when
the
wind
changes
we
get
them
after
warming
ourselves
by
a
big
fire
and
eating
luncheon
hubbard
and
i
took
our
rods
and
fished
the
greater
part
of
the
afternoon
catching
between
us
twelve
or
fifteen
trout
you
had
better
cook
them
all
for
supper
george
said
hubbard
this
is
my
mother
birthday
and
in
honour
of
it
we
have
an
extra
loaf
of
bread
and
some
of
her
dried
apples
and
i
tell
you
what
boys
i
wish
i
could
see
her
now
on
the
following
day
tuesday
august
the
weather
had
somewhat
moderated
but
the
east
wind
continued
and
the
rain
still
fell
during
all
the
forenoon
we
could
get
no
fish
at
our
camp
and
at
two
in
the
afternoon
started
forward
all
of
us
hungry
and
steadily
growing
hungrier
hubbard
whipped
the
water
at
the
foot
of
every
rapid
and
tried
every
pool
but
succeeded
in
getting
only
a
very
few
trout
while
he
fished
george
and
i
made
the
portages
and
thus
pushing
on
as
rapidly
as
possible
we
covered
about
four
miles
while
george
and
i
were
scouting
on
sunday
we
had
each
caught
sight
of
a
ridge
of
rocky
mountains
extending
in
a
northerly
and
southerly
direction
which
we
estimated
to
be
from
twenty
to
miles
to
the
westward
previous
to
tuesday
these
mountains
had
not
been
visible
from
the
river
valley
but
on
that
day
they
suddenly
came
into
view
and
they
made
us
stop
and
think
for
they
lay
directly
across
our
course
however
we
did
not
feel
much
uneasiness
then
as
we
decided
that
our
river
must
flow
through
a
pass
in
the
mountains
far
to
the
north
and
follow
them
down
before
turning
east
our
camp
on
tuesday
night
was
rather
a
dreary
one
but
before
noon
on
wednesday
august
the
clouds
broke
big
patches
of
blue
sky
began
to
appear
and
with
a
bit
of
sunshine
now
and
again
our
hearts
lightened
as
we
proceeded
on
our
journey
at
the
foot
of
a
portage
hubbard
caught
fourteen
trout
and
our
luncheon
was
secure
three
more
portages
we
made
covering
in
all
about
three
miles
and
then
we
shouted
for
joy
for
there
ahead
of
us
lay
open
water
along
it
for
five
miles
we
gaily
canoed
before
stopping
for
luncheon
hungry
yes
we
were
hungry
even
after
devouring
the
fourteen
trout
and
drinking
the
water
they
were
boiled
in
i
could
have
eaten
fifty
like
them
myself
but
our
spirits
were
high
and
we
made
merry
for
the
first
time
since
leaving
grand
lake
there
was
good
water
behind
us
and
good
water
before
us
at
the
last
rapid
we
portaged
the
country
had
flattened
out
wide
marshes
extended
along
the
south
bank
of
the
river
with
now
and
then
a
low
hill
of
drift
the
north
side
was
followed
by
a
low
ridge
of
drift
well
wooded
we
landed
for
luncheon
on
the
south
bank
at
the
foot
of
a
wooded
knoll
and
there
we
made
an
interesting
discovery
namely
the
remains
of
an
old
indian
camp
and
the
ruins
of
two
large
canoes
in
november
at
northwest
river
post
i
heard
the
story
of
those
canoes
twelve
years
before
it
appears
the
band
of
indians
that
had
camped
there
being
overtaken
by
early
ice
was
forced
to
abandon
its
canoes
and
make
a
dash
for
the
post
game
was
scarce
and
the
fish
had
gone
to
deeper
waters
the
indians
pushed
desperately
on
overland
but
one
by
one
they
fell
until
at
last
the
gaunt
fiend
starvation
had
claimed
them
all
since
that
time
no
indian
has
ever
travelled
that
trail
the
route
to
michikamau
upon
which
we
had
stumbled
was
thereupon
abandoned
the
indians
believe
the
trail
is
not
only
unlucky
but
haunted
that
if
while
on
it
they
should
escape
starvation
that
terrible
enemy
which
nearly
always
dogs
them
so
closely
they
are
likely
to
encounter
the
spirits
of
them
that
died
so
many
years
ago
not
knowing
anything
of
this
tragic
story
we
merrily
ate
our
luncheon
on
the
very
spot
where
others
in
desperation
had
faced
death
it
was
to
us
an
old
indian
camp
and
an
additional
reason
for
believing
we
were
on
the
right
trail
that
was
all
while
we
ate
the
sun
came
out
brilliantly
and
we
resumed
our
paddling
feeling
ready
for
almost
anything
that
might
happen
and
something
soon
did
happen
something
that
made
the
day
the
most
memorable
so
far
of
the
trip
no
rapids
intercepted
our
progress
and
in
an
hour
we
had
paddled
three
miles
when
at
a
place
where
the
river
widened
a
big
woodland
stag
caribou
suddenly
splashed
into
the
water
from
the
northern
shore
two
hundred
yards
ahead
i
seized
my
rifle
and
without
waiting
for
the
canoe
to
stop
fired
the
bullet
went
high
the
caribou
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
us
inquisitively
then
hubbard
fired
and
with
the
dying
away
of
the
report
of
his
rifle
george
and
i
shouted
you
hit
hubbard
you
got
the
wounded
caribou
sank
half
way
to
his
knees
but
struggled
to
his
feet
again
as
he
did
so
hubbard
sent
another
shot
at
him
but
missed
slowly
the
big
deer
turned
and
began
to
struggle
up
the
bank
again
hubbard
and
i
fired
but
both
shots
went
low
we
ran
the
canoe
to
shore
and
while
i
made
it
fast
hubbard
and
george
ran
breathlessly
ahead
to
where
the
caribou
had
disappeared
i
followed
at
once
and
soon
came
upon
them
and
the
caribou
which
fallen
thirty
yards
from
the
river
with
a
bullet
through
his
body
just
back
of
the
left
shoulder
a
trail
of
blood
marked
his
path
from
the
river
to
where
he
lay
as
the
animal
floundered
there
in
the
moss
hubbard
with
the
nervous
impetuosity
he
frequently
displayed
fired
again
against
george
protest
the
bullet
entering
the
caribou
neck
and
passing
down
through
his
tongue
the
full
length
then
george
caught
the
thrashing
animal
by
the
antlers
and
while
he
held
its
head
down
hubbard
cut
its
throat
we
made
our
camp
right
where
the
caribou
fell
it
was
an
ideal
spot
on
the
high
bank
above
the
river
being
flat
and
thickly
covered
with
white
moss
the
banks
at
this
point
were
all
sand
drift
we
could
not
find
a
stone
large
enough
to
whet
our
knives
george
made
a
stage
for
drying
while
hubbard
and
i
dressed
the
deer
our
work
finished
we
all
sat
down
and
roasted
steaks
on
sticks
and
drank
coffee
the
knowledge
that
we
were
now
assured
of
a
good
stock
of
dried
meat
of
course
added
to
the
hilarity
of
feast
as
we
thought
it
best
to
hoard
our
morsel
of
flour
it
was
a
feast
of
venison
and
venison
alone
while
waiting
for
our
meat
to
dry
we
had
to
remain
in
camp
for
three
or
four
days
on
the
next
afternoon
thursday
august
hubbard
and
i
paddled
about
three
miles
up
the
river
to
look
for
fish
but
we
got
no
bites
probably
because
of
the
cold
in
the
morning
there
had
been
a
fringe
of
ice
on
the
river
shore
we
take
it
easy
said
hubbard
while
we
were
paddling
upstream
and
make
a
little
picnic
of
it
i
dead
tired
myself
how
do
you
feel
wallace
i
feel
tired
too
i
said
i
have
to
make
an
extra
effort
to
do
any
work
at
all
hubbard
was
inclined
to
attribute
this
tired
feeling
to
the
freedom
from
strain
after
our
work
of
the
last
few
weeks
while
i
hazarded
the
opinion
that
our
purely
meat
diet
had
made
us
lazy
probably
it
was
due
to
both
causes
as
hubbard
was
anxious
to
obtain
definite
knowledge
as
to
what
effect
the
high
ridge
of
rocky
mountains
had
upon
our
river
george
and
i
with
the
object
of
ascertaining
the
river
course
left
camp
in
the
canoe
on
friday
morning
august
taking
with
us
in
addition
to
our
emergency
kits
our
cups
some
tea
and
enough
caribou
ribs
for
luncheon
we
portaged
around
a
few
short
rapids
and
then
about
eight
miles
above
our
camp
came
upon
a
lake
expansion
of
considerable
size
with
many
inlets
on
the
northerly
side
of
the
lake
was
a
high
barren
hill
which
afforded
us
a
splendid
view
of
the
surrounding
country
winding
away
to
the
southeast
was
the
river
we
had
ascended
to
the
west
was
a
series
of
lake
expansions
connected
by
narrow
straits
and
beyond
them
were
the
mountains
which
we
estimated
rose
about
feet
above
the
country
at
their
base
in
sheltered
places
on
their
sides
patches
of
ice
and
snow
glistened
in
the
sunshine
barren
almost
to
their
base
not
a
vestige
of
vegetation
to
be
seen
anywhere
on
their
tops
or
sides
they
presented
a
scene
of
desolate
grandeur
standing
out
against
the
blue
sky
like
a
grim
barrier
placed
there
to
guard
the
land
beyond
as
i
gazed
upon
them
some
lines
from
explorer
that
i
had
often
heard
hubbard
repeat
were
brought
forcibly
to
my
mind
something
hidden
go
and
find
it
go
and
look
behind
the
ranges
something
lost
behind
the
ranges
lost
and
waiting
for
you
go
let
us
call
these
ranges
the
kipling
mountains
to
the
north
hill
after
hill
with
bald
top
rising
above
the
stunted
trees
on
its
sides
limited
our
range
of
vision
far
away
to
the
south
stretched
a
rolling
wooded
country
to
the
eastward
the
country
was
flatter
with
irregular
ranges
of
low
hills
all
covered
with
a
thick
growth
of
spruce
and
fir
balsam
beyond
the
point
where
the
water
flowed
from
it
southeasterly
into
the
river
we
had
ascended
the
lake
at
the
foot
of
our
hill
seemed
to
extend
directly
eastward
for
four
for
five
miles
but
the
thick
wood
of
the
valleys
and
hills
made
it
difficult
to
see
just
where
it
ended
so
that
from
where
we
stood
it
was
impossible
to
tell
what
course
the
river
took
whether
it
came
from
the
east
bending
about
in
the
lake
expansion
below
us
or
flowed
from
the
west
through
the
lake
expansions
beyond
away
off
to
the
northeast
an
apparently
large
lake
could
be
discerned
with
numerous
islands
dotting
its
surface
for
a
long
time
we
stood
and
gazed
about
us
far
to
the
southeast
a
tiny
curl
of
smoke
rose
heavenward
in
the
clear
atmosphere
that
was
hubbard
campfire
the
only
sign
of
life
to
be
seen
in
all
that
wide
wilderness
the
scene
was
impressive
beyond
description
it
gave
me
a
peculiar
feeling
of
solemnity
and
awe
that
i
shall
never
forget
we
found
on
our
hill
a
few
dead
twigs
of
shrubbery
with
which
to
make
a
fire
to
broil
our
caribou
ribs
and
gathered
some
mildly
acid
berries
of
a
variety
neither
of
us
had
ever
seen
before
which
we
ate
as
a
dessert
after
luncheon
george
said
he
thought
we
had
better
go
to
the
westward
to
look
for
the
river
but
how
can
it
come
through
those
mountains
i
asked
i
do
know
as
it
can
he
replied
but
pointing
to
one
of
the
range
i
want
to
take
a
look
at
the
country
beyond
from
that
high
mountain
so
we
returned
to
our
canoe
and
paddled
to
the
westward
a
few
miles
through
two
lake
expansions
which
brought
us
to
the
foot
of
the
mountains
we
landed
at
a
place
where
a
small
creek
tumbled
down
through
a
rocky
pass
george
went
up
his
mountain
alone
during
his
absence
with
my
emergency
kit
i
caught
ten
trout
to
be
divided
between
us
for
supper
as
only
two
of
our
caribou
ribs
remained
near
dark
george
came
back
after
climbing
half
way
to
the
summit
of
his
mountain
he
had
encountered
perpendicular
walls
of
rock
that
blocked
his
further
progress
we
made
a
fire
of
old
wigwam
poles
and
roasted
our
fish
before
it
on
a
flat
stone
a
quart
of
hot
tea
between
us
washed
down
our
meagre
supper
and
then
we
made
a
bed
of
boughs
but
when
we
tried
to
sleep
the
icy
wind
that
blew
through
the
pass
caused
us
to
draw
closer
to
the
fire
before
which
we
alternately
sat
and
lay
shivering
throughout
the
night
having
brought
no
axe
with
us
we
could
not
build
a
fire
of
any
size
i
do
not
believe
either
of
us
slept
more
than
half
an
hour
which
would
you
rather
have
wallace
a
piece
of
bread
or
a
blanket
george
would
ask
at
frequent
intervals
bread
i
always
answered
at
that
he
would
chuckle
we
had
tasted
nothing
but
venison
and
fish
since
the
day
we
killed
the
caribou
and
for
bread
we
had
an
inexpressible
craving
anyway
george
would
say
this
cold
will
weaken
the
flies
and
with
this
reflection
he
continued
to
comfort
us
as
the
nights
became
chillier
in
the
morning
we
had
to
break
the
ice
to
get
water
for
our
tea
which
with
the
two
remaining
caribou
ribs
constituted
our
breakfast
george
then
made
another
attempt
at
his
mountain
again
he
failed
to
reach
the
summit
and
i
failed
to
induce
any
more
trout
to
rise
in
a
somewhat
despondent
mood
we
turned
back
and
paddled
for
some
distance
into
the
lake
expansions
to
the
eastward
of
the
point
where
our
river
flowed
out
although
we
were
compelled
to
start
for
home
before
obtaining
any
definite
knowledge
of
the
course
of
the
river
we
were
of
the
opinion
that
it
came
from
the
east
for
all
we
knew
however
the
river
might
end
in
those
lake
expansions
we
could
not
tell
as
no
current
could
be
discerned
and
having
no
food
we
could
not
continue
the
search
it
was
five
in
the
evening
when
we
reached
camp
tired
out
and
as
hungry
as
two
wolves
and
we
astonished
hubbard
with
the
amount
of
venison
we
put
out
of
sight
while
george
was
temporarily
out
of
hearing
hubbard
said
it
bully
good
to
see
you
back
again
wallace
i
was
disappointed
when
you
did
come
back
last
night
and
i
been
dead
lonesome
i
got
thinking
of
my
wife
and
home
and
the
good
things
to
eat
there
and
was
on
the
verge
of
homesickness
we
were
mightily
disappointed
too
at
not
getting
back
said
i
between
mouthfuls
up
there
on
the
lakes
we
put
in
the
toughest
night
yet
and
we
were
thinking
of
the
venison
and
warm
blankets
down
here
at
camp
hubbard
was
much
discouraged
and
depressed
at
our
report
of
the
uncertain
course
of
the
river
although
he
was
careful
to
conceal
his
feelings
from
george
the
next
day
sunday
august
we
cut
up
our
canvas
guncases
and
used
some
of
the
material
to
our
moccasins
what
was
left
over
we
put
away
carefully
for
future
use
george
cracked
the
caribou
bones
and
boiled
out
the
marrow
grease
he
stripped
the
fat
from
the
entrails
and
tried
out
the
tallow
preserving
even
the
cracklings
or
scraps
we
be
glad
to
eat
yet
said
he
one
of
the
hoofs
he
dressed
and
put
with
our
store
of
meat
we
preserved
everything
but
the
head
the
entrails
and
three
of
the
hoofs
the
tallow
we
found
an
excellent
substitute
for
lard
in
the
afternoon
hubbard
and
i
caught
thirty
trout
in
an
hour
at
the
rapid
a
mile
and
a
half
above
our
camp
and
a
few
more
in
the
river
close
by
the
camp
high
living
during
the
day
raised
all
of
our
spirits
for
breakfast
we
had
the
caribou
heart
which
george
thought
at
first
he
would
roast
but
changed
his
mind
and
served
stewed
for
dinner
we
had
the
tongue
the
tidbit
of
the
animal
boiled
with
pieces
of
other
parts
hubbard
second
bullet
had
torn
out
the
centre
of
the
tongue
but
what
there
was
of
it
was
delicious
and
at
night
we
had
the
trout
caught
during
the
afternoon
to
which
as
a
sunday
luxury
was
added
a
cake
of
bread
when
we
gathered
around
the
fire
in
the
evening
hubbard
had
entirely
recovered
from
his
depression
and
took
a
more
hopeful
view
of
the
river
we
discussed
the
matter
thoroughly
and
decided
that
the
river
george
and
i
had
seen
coming
from
the
eastward
must
take
a
turn
farther
north
and
break
through
the
kipling
mountains
and
that
it
might
prove
to
be
low
northwest
river
we
all
thought
was
possible
at
the
same
time
we
could
not
disguise
the
fact
that
it
was
extremely
probable
we
should
have
to
portage
over
the
mountains
and
the
prospect
was
far
from
pleasing
but
ragged
and
almost
barefooted
though
we
were
not
a
man
thought
of
turning
back
and
on
monday
morning
august
we
prepared
to
leave
camp
caribou
and
solve
the
problem
as
to
where
lay
the
trail
of
michikamau
viii
michikamau
or
bust
the
temperature
was
three
degrees
below
freezing
when
grey
dawn
at
half
past
four
that
monday
morning
bid
us
up
and
on
the
crisp
air
and
the
surpassing
beauty
of
the
morning
stirred
within
us
new
hope
and
renewed
ambition
and
the
bags
of
jerked
venison
and
the
grease
gave
us
faith
that
we
should
succeed
in
reaching
our
goal
though
we
had
some
food
in
stock
there
was
to
be
no
cessation
in
our
effort
to
get
fish
our
plan
was
for
hubbard
to
try
his
rod
at
the
foot
of
every
rapid
while
george
and
i
did
the
portaging
before
midday
hubbard
had
forty
trout
one
of
them
sixteen
inches
long
the
biggest
we
had
caught
yet
we
stopped
for
luncheon
on
the
sandy
shore
of
a
pretty
little
lake
expansion
and
ate
the
whole
morning
catch
fried
in
caribou
tallow
with
unsweetened
coffee
to
wash
it
down
then
on
we
pushed
towards
the
kipling
mountains
at
a
narrow
strait
between
two
lakes
we
left
hubbard
to
fish
george
and
i
going
on
two
miles
farther
to
the
place
where
we
had
spent
that
chilly
night
while
scouting
and
where
our
camp
for
this
night
was
to
be
pitched
our
object
in
going
there
was
to
give
george
another
chance
to
view
the
country
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
range
this
time
he
was
to
try
another
peak
as
he
disappeared
up
the
mountain
side
i
paddled
back
to
get
hubbard
who
was
awaiting
me
with
a
good
string
of
big
trout
the
stretch
of
lake
from
where
hubbard
was
fishing
to
our
camping
ground
was
as
smooth
as
a
sheet
of
glass
the
sun
hanging
low
over
the
mountains
and
reflecting
their
nude
forms
in
the
silvery
water
and
the
dark
green
forest
of
fir
trees
on
the
shores
moved
hubbard
to
exclamations
of
delight
oh
if
it
could
be
painted
just
as
it
appears
now
he
said
why
wallace
this
one
scene
is
worth
all
the
groaning
we
done
to
get
here
it
grand
grand
at
dark
george
returned
to
camp
with
the
report
that
from
his
peak
he
could
see
only
higher
mountains
looming
up
to
the
westward
in
the
shadow
of
the
grey
rocks
of
the
grim
old
mountains
that
so
stubbornly
held
their
secret
of
what
lay
beyond
we
had
a
good
supper
of
trout
and
were
happy
though
through
the
gulch
the
creek
roared
defiance
at
us
and
off
in
the
night
somewhere
a
loon
would
break
out
at
intervals
in
derisive
laughter
at
the
base
of
the
mountains
the
narrow
lake
reflected
a
million
stars
and
in
their
kindly
light
the
snow
and
ice
patches
on
the
slopes
above
us
gleamed
white
and
brilliant
with
our
day
work
the
listlessness
from
which
we
had
recently
suffered
had
entirely
disappeared
and
we
felt
ready
to
undertake
any
task
the
more
difficult
the
better
hubbard
suggested
giving
up
route
hunting
if
our
river
ended
where
we
then
were
and
striking
right
across
the
mountains
with
our
outfit
on
our
backs
and
we
received
the
suggestion
with
enthusiasm
he
talked
too
a
great
deal
about
snowshoeing
in
winter
to
augustine
on
the
lawrence
cutting
across
country
from
the
kenemish
river
which
flows
into
groswater
bay
opposite
northwest
river
post
this
trip
which
he
held
out
as
a
possibility
in
the
event
of
our
missing
the
last
steamer
out
from
rigolet
seemed
to
appeal
to
him
immensely
i
do
care
if
we
are
too
late
for
the
steamer
he
said
that
snowshoeing
trip
would
be
a
great
stunt
we
found
a
great
many
wigwam
poles
near
and
in
the
pass
hard
by
our
camp
while
by
the
creek
we
came
across
the
remains
of
both
summer
and
winter
camps
probably
those
of
hunters
one
of
the
beggars
was
said
george
he
had
a
stove
this
was
evidenced
by
the
arrangement
of
stones
within
the
circle
of
wigwam
poles
and
a
few
pieces
of
wood
cut
on
tuesday
morning
august
we
turned
back
and
into
the
long
narrow
lake
expansions
to
the
eastward
and
soon
satisfied
ourselves
that
this
was
the
right
course
our
thermometer
registered
degrees
that
morning
the
day
dawned
clear
and
perfect
it
was
a
morning
when
one
draws
in
long
breaths
and
one
nerves
tingle
and
life
is
a
joy
early
in
the
forenoon
we
reached
rapids
and
quickly
portaged
around
them
all
were
short
the
largest
being
not
more
than
half
a
mile
at
ten
we
ate
luncheon
at
the
foot
of
one
of
the
rapids
where
we
caught
in
a
few
minutes
fourteen
large
trout
just
above
this
rapid
the
river
opened
into
long
narrow
lakes
and
the
canoeing
was
superb
suddenly
the
river
took
a
sharp
turn
to
the
westward
and
appeared
to
lead
directly
into
the
mountains
at
that
we
sent
up
three
rousing
cheers
the
river
problem
seemed
to
be
solved
apparently
the
road
to
michikamau
lay
straight
before
us
a
little
above
the
bend
in
the
river
we
came
upon
an
old
gander
and
goose
and
two
unfeathered
young
the
gander
with
a
great
squawk
and
flapping
wings
took
to
the
bush
but
we
killed
the
old
goose
with
a
rifle
and
george
knocked
over
as
he
expressed
it
one
of
the
young
ones
with
a
pistol
more
luck
and
food
came
to
us
a
little
later
while
george
and
i
portaged
around
the
last
rapid
that
evening
hubbard
caught
fifty
trout
averaging
over
a
pound
each
they
jumped
greedily
to
the
fly
four
or
five
rising
at
every
cast
above
this
rapid
the
river
again
took
the
form
of
a
long
narrow
lake
a
lake
so
beautiful
that
we
were
entranced
it
was
evening
when
we
arrived
and
the
very
spirit
of
peace
seemed
to
brood
over
the
place
undoubtedly
we
were
the
first
white
men
that
had
ever
invaded
its
solitude
and
the
first
human
beings
of
any
kind
to
disturb
its
repose
for
many
years
on
the
north
a
barren
rocky
bluff
rose
high
above
the
water
at
all
other
places
the
shores
were
low
and
wooded
a
few
miles
to
the
westward
could
be
seen
the
barren
kipling
mountains
and
between
them
and
us
was
a
ridge
of
low
hills
covered
with
spruce
the
sun
was
setting
in
our
faces
as
we
paddled
slowly
along
the
lake
and
as
it
went
down
behind
the
mountains
a
veil
was
gradually
drawn
over
the
lovely
scene
not
a
breath
of
air
was
stirring
and
hardly
a
sound
broke
the
stillness
save
the
ripple
at
the
bow
of
the
canoe
and
the
soft
splash
of
the
paddles
in
the
placid
waters
two
otters
were
swimming
and
diving
one
was
timid
and
remained
at
a
distance
but
the
other
was
bold
and
inquisitive
and
came
close
to
the
canoe
here
and
there
all
over
the
lake
its
surface
was
broken
by
big
jumping
trout
two
loons
laughed
at
us
as
we
drew
the
canoe
on
to
the
sandy
beach
of
a
low
jutting
point
and
they
continued
to
laugh
while
we
pitched
our
camp
in
the
green
woods
near
the
shore
and
prepared
our
supper
of
roast
goose
it
was
a
feast
day
with
goose
plenty
of
trout
and
good
water
for
paddling
it
was
a
time
to
eat
drink
and
be
merry
our
high
spirits
still
remained
when
we
broke
camp
in
the
morning
wednesday
august
but
they
were
destined
soon
to
be
dashed
not
long
after
we
started
we
found
ourselves
in
lakes
with
arms
extending
in
every
direction
all
day
we
hunted
for
the
river
but
found
only
small
streams
emptying
into
the
lakes
the
country
now
was
much
rougher
and
much
more
rocky
and
barren
than
any
we
had
seen
since
we
left
the
coast
the
trees
were
more
stunted
and
gnarled
and
the
streams
usually
had
a
bottom
in
the
course
of
the
day
hubbard
shot
three
rock
ptarmigans
rockers
george
called
them
they
were
the
first
we
had
seen
and
were
still
wearing
their
mottled
summer
dress
later
in
the
season
they
are
a
pure
spotless
white
towards
evening
we
made
our
way
to
a
point
on
the
northwesterly
part
of
the
lakes
where
a
small
stream
came
through
a
mountain
pass
and
there
went
into
camp
we
were
much
disappointed
at
our
failure
to
find
the
river
but
not
disheartened
in
order
to
make
certain
that
we
had
not
overlooked
it
we
decided
to
paddle
back
the
next
day
as
far
as
the
last
rapid
and
make
one
more
careful
search
failing
then
to
find
the
river
we
should
portage
through
the
mountain
pass
at
the
entrance
to
which
we
had
camped
do
you
remember
asked
hubbard
the
slogan
of
the
old
peakers
peak
or
bust
yes
said
i
and
very
often
they
busted
well
said
hubbard
we
adopt
it
and
change
it
to
our
needs
or
bust
will
be
our
watchword
now
and
sitting
around
the
fire
we
all
took
it
up
and
repeated
determinedly
michikamau
or
bust
the
morning
of
the
next
day
thursday
august
we
occupied
in
mending
our
moccasins
with
parts
of
the
caribou
skin
george
also
took
the
venison
from
the
bags
and
hung
it
over
the
fire
to
give
it
a
little
more
drying
as
it
had
begun
to
mould
in
the
afternoon
hubbard
and
i
in
accordance
with
the
plan
we
had
adopted
paddled
back
over
our
course
and
the
lower
lakes
we
discovered
nothing
new
the
fact
was
that
these
lakes
were
the
source
of
the
beaver
river
while
we
were
paddling
about
we
came
upon
two
old
and
two
young
loons
the
old
ones
tried
to
lure
us
away
from
their
young
by
coming
very
near
the
canoe
the
young
loons
made
frequent
dives
but
we
succeeded
in
catching
one
of
them
finally
however
we
restored
it
to
its
parents
and
when
the
loon
family
was
there
was
great
rejoicing
in
the
household
in
the
pool
at
the
foot
of
the
last
rapid
we
spent
an
hour
fishing
and
caught
trout
averaging
perhaps
a
each
upon
our
return
to
camp
in
the
evening
we
dressed
our
catch
and
hung
the
fish
to
dry
over
a
slow
smoky
fire
the
river
having
come
to
an
end
our
only
course
now
was
to
cross
the
mountains
and
on
friday
august
with
michikamau
or
bust
for
our
slogan
we
began
our
portage
along
the
stream
that
flowed
through
the
pass
near
our
camp
a
heavy
rain
was
falling
during
the
first
part
of
the
day
in
the
course
of
which
we
crossed
three
small
ponds
the
travelling
was
fairly
good
but
during
the
latter
part
it
was
exceedingly
rough
and
difficult
we
pitched
our
tent
that
night
on
the
divide
in
other
words
we
had
reached
the
place
where
small
streams
flowed
both
east
and
west
the
cold
rain
continued
when
we
broke
camp
the
next
morning
saturday
august
for
a
time
we
again
encountered
rough
work
forcing
a
passage
over
rocks
and
through
thick
brush
and
scrambling
down
high
banks
and
then
as
we
neared
the
end
of
the
pass
the
portage
became
less
difficult
before
noon
we
came
upon
a
lake
of
considerable
size
and
unmistakable
signs
that
in
directing
our
course
through
the
pass
we
had
kept
upon
the
old
indian
trail
on
the
edge
of
the
lake
we
shall
call
it
lake
hope
trees
had
been
blazed
to
make
plain
the
exact
point
where
the
portage
trail
left
the
water
and
near
this
place
were
sweat
holes
where
the
medicine
men
had
given
baths
to
the
sick
much
drift
wood
showing
axe
cuttings
was
on
the
shore
and
we
picked
up
an
old
canoe
paddle
of
indian
make
all
this
led
us
to
believe
we
were
on
waters
connected
directly
with
lake
michikamau
which
was
the
fact
and
we
thought
that
possibly
we
had
reached
a
deep
bay
said
to
extend
from
the
main
body
of
the
lake
some
thirty
miles
in
a
southeasterly
direction
where
we
launched
our
canoe
the
mountain
pass
was
very
narrow
and
on
the
southerly
side
rising
almost
perpendicularly
from
the
water
to
a
height
of
eight
or
nine
hundred
feet
stood
a
hill
of
absolutely
bare
rock
the
wind
was
blowing
the
rain
in
sheets
over
its
face
and
despite
the
wet
and
chill
we
paused
to
enjoy
the
grandeur
of
the
scene
we
had
travelled
about
six
miles
through
the
pass
and
this
hill
marked
its
end
the
mountain
barrier
that
at
one
time
seemed
so
formidable
had
not
proved
so
difficult
to
cross
after
all
and
in
accomplishing
the
pass
we
had
reached
the
great
interior
plateau
the
land
that
lay
hidden
behind
the
ranges
after
we
had
paddled
along
lake
hope
a
hundred
yards
we
struck
a
rock
that
tore
a
hole
through
the
bottom
of
the
canoe
this
accident
forced
us
to
take
refuge
on
a
island
where
george
could
repair
the
damage
and
procure
gum
from
the
spruce
trees
to
cover
the
patch
sunshine
came
with
sunday
morning
august
and
we
dried
our
blankets
and
camp
outfit
before
starting
forward
so
that
it
was
after
ten
when
we
quit
the
island
lake
hope
proved
to
be
long
and
narrow
and
we
soon
realised
that
it
could
not
be
southeast
bay
but
at
the
western
end
we
hoped
to
find
a
strait
connecting
it
with
another
lake
and
as
we
approached
the
western
end
with
a
feeling
of
uncertainty
as
to
what
lay
beyond
george
remarked
it
like
goin
into
a
room
where
there
a
christmas
tree
sure
enough
there
was
a
strait
and
as
we
turned
into
it
we
saw
beyond
big
water
stretching
away
to
the
westward
for
miles
there
a
christmas
tree
without
a
doubt
said
hubbard
we
felt
positive
now
that
this
second
lake
was
michikamau
southeast
bay
and
we
broke
the
solemn
stillness
of
the
wilderness
with
three
lusty
cheers
it
is
violating
no
confidence
to
say
here
that
the
second
lake
was
not
michikamau
southeast
bay
it
was
simply
the
body
of
water
that
appears
on
my
map
under
the
name
lost
trail
lake
two
and
a
half
miles
up
lost
trail
lake
we
climbed
a
barren
ridge
where
we
found
blueberries
mossberries
and
berries
the
latter
berry
is
and
grows
on
a
plant
resembling
that
of
the
strawberry
the
berry
itself
resembles
in
form
the
raspberry
and
has
a
flavour
like
that
of
a
baked
apple
from
which
fact
it
derives
its
name
it
ripens
after
the
first
frost
the
mossberry
is
small
and
black
resembling
in
shape
and
size
the
blueberry
and
is
sweet
and
palatable
after
being
touched
with
frost
it
is
usually
found
on
the
moss
clinging
to
rocks
on
the
ridge
it
grew
in
abundance
and
we
ate
a
great
many
the
blueberry
of
labrador
is
similar
to
the
blueberry
of
the
united
states
some
distance
beyond
where
we
got
the
berries
we
went
into
camp
trolling
on
the
way
we
caught
a
namaycush
lake
trout
the
first
we
had
seen
on
the
trip
in
our
camp
on
lost
trail
lake
we
were
held
all
of
monday
august
by
a
gale
that
beat
the
water
into
a
fury
we
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
try
our
gill
net
sinking
it
on
the
lee
shore
but
it
was
so
rotten
it
would
not
hold
a
fish
large
enough
to
get
fast
in
it
and
we
finally
threw
it
away
as
a
useless
encumbrance
in
the
course
of
the
day
hubbard
and
climbed
a
hill
not
far
away
while
i
remained
in
camp
to
do
some
chores
they
found
berries
in
abundance
the
only
spot
we
came
across
where
they
grew
in
any
great
quantity
and
had
a
good
look
at
a
lake
we
had
previously
sighted
two
miles
to
the
north
this
lake
was
larger
than
the
one
we
were
on
being
about
miles
long
it
was
in
fact
the
largest
body
of
water
by
far
that
we
had
seen
since
leaving
grand
lake
its
size
impressed
hubbard
with
the
fatal
belief
that
it
rather
than
lost
trail
lake
was
connected
with
michikamau
and
to
it
he
decided
to
go
our
experience
there
led
us
to
call
it
lake
disappointment
we
portaged
into
it
on
tuesday
morning
august
our
course
was
over
a
neck
of
land
which
was
mostly
soft
marsh
partially
covered
with
spruce
we
did
not
know
then
that
in
abandoning
lost
trail
lake
for
lake
disappointment
we
were
wandering
from
the
indian
trail
to
michikamau
some
indians
i
met
during
the
winter
at
northwest
river
post
told
me
that
a
river
flowed
out
of
the
western
end
of
lost
trail
lake
into
the
very
southeast
bay
of
lake
michikamau
we
were
longing
so
much
to
see
this
was
the
trail
and
we
lost
it
we
ate
our
luncheon
on
the
southern
shore
of
lake
disappointment
that
afternoon
and
the
next
two
days
august
and
we
spent
in
paddling
about
the
lake
in
a
vain
search
for
a
river
thirty
or
more
miles
a
day
we
paddled
and
found
nothing
but
comparatively
small
creeks
one
of
these
we
followed
almost
to
its
source
and
then
returned
to
the
lake
again
we
were
living
pretty
well
while
we
were
on
these
lakes
near
the
mountains
we
killed
four
geese
and
one
and
caught
about
eighty
trout
two
namaycush
and
a
pike
the
pike
we
got
in
this
unsportsmanlike
manner
we
were
fishing
for
trout
in
a
creek
that
emptied
into
lake
disappointment
in
a
succession
of
falls
and
found
that
while
there
were
some
above
the
lower
fall
none
could
be
induced
to
rise
where
the
creek
at
the
foot
of
the
lower
fall
made
an
ideal
pool
for
them
we
were
lunching
on
a
rock
near
this
pool
when
hubbard
suddenly
remarked
there
only
one
reason
why
trout
do
rise
here
what
that
i
asked
pike
he
answered
laconically
and
left
his
luncheon
to
fasten
a
trolling
hook
on
his
trout
line
after
he
had
fixed
a
piece
of
cork
to
the
line
for
a
bobber
he
baited
the
hook
with
a
small
live
trout
and
dropped
it
into
the
pool
now
we
have
a
pike
said
he
scarcely
had
he
resumed
his
luncheon
when
the
cork
bobbed
under
and
he
grabbed
his
rod
to
find
a
big
fish
on
the
other
end
he
played
it
around
until
it
was
near
the
shore
and
as
it
arose
to
the
surface
i
put
a
pistol
bullet
through
its
head
then
hubbard
hauled
in
the
line
and
he
had
our
pike
there
were
two
occasions
when
we
felt
particularly
like
feasting
one
was
when
we
were
progressing
with
a
clear
course
ahead
and
were
happy
and
the
other
was
when
we
were
not
sure
of
the
way
and
were
blue
that
night
we
were
blue
so
we
had
a
feast
of
goose
and
pike
hubbard
planked
the
pike
and
it
was
excellent
all
of
our
food
was
eaten
now
without
salt
but
we
were
getting
used
to
its
absence
after
our
feast
hubbard
astonished
george
and
me
by
taking
out
a
new
pipe
i
had
brought
along
to
trade
with
the
indians
and
filling
it
with
the
red
willow
bark
george
and
i
had
been
mixing
with
our
tobacco
we
watched
him
curiously
as
he
lighted
it
for
with
the
exception
of
a
puff
or
two
on
a
cigarette
he
had
never
smoked
before
he
finished
the
pipe
without
flinching
i
asked
him
how
he
liked
it
pretty
good
he
said
then
after
a
pause
he
added
and
i
tell
you
what
if
ever
i
start
out
again
on
another
expedition
of
this
sort
i
am
going
to
learn
to
smoke
watching
you
fellows
makes
me
believe
it
must
be
a
great
comfort
george
and
i
had
been
mixing
red
willow
bark
with
our
tobacco
because
our
stock
had
become
alarmingly
low
in
fact
it
would
have
been
entirely
gone
had
not
hubbard
presented
us
with
some
black
plug
chewing
he
had
purchased
at
rigolet
to
trade
with
the
indians
the
plugs
having
been
wet
had
run
together
in
one
mass
but
we
dried
it
out
before
the
fire
and
mixed
with
the
bark
it
was
not
so
bad
later
on
george
and
i
took
to
drying
out
the
tea
leaves
and
mixing
them
with
the
tobacco
on
wednesday
morning
august
when
we
left
camp
to
continue
the
search
for
a
river
we
decided
to
leave
the
caribou
skin
behind
us
its
odour
had
become
most
offensive
and
in
spite
of
our
efforts
to
keep
out
the
flies
they
had
filled
it
with
blows
and
it
was
now
fairly
crawling
with
maggots
on
thursday
when
we
were
passing
the
same
way
george
gave
a
striking
example
of
his
prescience
he
was
at
the
stern
paddle
and
turned
the
canoe
to
the
place
where
we
had
left
the
hide
what
are
you
stopping
for
asked
hubbard
i
thought
i
would
get
that
caribou
skin
wash
it
off
and
take
it
along
said
george
what
in
the
world
do
you
expect
to
do
with
it
well
answered
george
quietly
we
may
want
to
eat
it
some
day
hubbard
and
i
both
laughed
nevertheless
hubbard
jumped
out
of
the
canoe
with
george
and
helped
him
wash
the
skin
and
we
took
it
along
and
as
george
predicted
the
day
came
when
we
were
glad
we
did
it
was
on
thursday
night
that
disgusted
and
weary
we
gave
up
the
search
for
a
river
our
camp
was
on
the
north
shore
of
lake
disappointment
down
near
the
western
end
hubbard
now
expressed
the
opinion
that
we
should
have
to
portage
north
or
northwest
across
country
his
idea
was
that
by
proceeding
north
we
should
eventually
reach
the
river
that
low
had
mapped
as
flowing
from
michikamau
the
northwest
if
we
reached
the
latitude
in
which
the
river
was
supposed
to
be
and
could
not
find
it
hubbard
plan
then
called
for
our
turning
directly
west
the
situation
that
confronted
us
was
serious
hubbard
had
recently
had
another
attack
of
diarrhoea
and
was
weak
the
patches
we
put
on
our
moccasins
would
last
only
a
day
or
two
and
we
were
practically
barefoot
our
rags
were
hanging
in
strips
our
venison
was
going
rapidly
and
our
flour
was
practically
gone
to
portage
across
country
meant
that
we
should
probably
not
have
many
opportunities
for
fishing
as
we
should
not
have
any
stream
to
follow
getting
game
had
proved
uncertain
even
were
we
to
face
towards
home
we
had
not
sufficient
provisions
to
carry
us
half
way
to
northwest
river
post
that
thursday
evening
in
camp
we
discussed
the
situation
from
all
sides
we
knew
that
if
we
pressed
on
winter
in
all
probability
would
overtake
us
before
we
reached
a
post
but
we
decided
that
we
should
fight
our
way
on
to
lake
michikamau
and
the
george
river
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
we
were
taking
a
long
chance
nevertheless
we
refused
to
entertain
the
thought
of
turning
back
daring
starvation
we
should
on
the
morrow
start
overland
and
see
what
lay
beyond
the
hills
to
the
northward
michikamau
or
bust
was
still
our
slogan
ix
and
there
was
michikamau
from
the
northwesterly
end
of
lake
disappointment
we
portaged
on
friday
august
across
a
neck
of
land
to
two
small
shallow
lakes
that
lay
to
the
northward
and
in
the
teeth
of
a
gale
paddled
to
the
northern
shore
of
the
farther
lake
there
we
went
into
camp
for
the
day
in
order
that
hubbard
might
rest
as
he
was
still
weak
from
the
effects
of
his
recent
illness
we
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
patch
up
our
moccasins
and
clothing
as
best
we
could
and
held
a
long
consultation
the
outcome
of
which
was
that
it
was
decided
that
for
the
present
at
least
we
should
leave
behind
us
our
canoe
and
the
bulk
of
our
camp
equipment
including
the
tent
and
push
on
with
light
packs
consisting
of
one
blanket
for
each
man
an
axe
the
two
pistols
one
rifle
and
our
stock
of
food
before
us
there
apparently
stretched
miles
of
rough
rocky
country
our
equipment
and
stock
of
food
at
this
time
made
up
into
four
packs
of
about
pounds
each
the
canoe
and
its
crevices
filled
with
sand
must
now
have
weighed
nearly
a
hundred
pounds
it
was
a
most
awkward
thing
to
carry
over
one
head
when
the
wind
blew
and
where
there
were
rocks
there
was
danger
of
the
carrier
falling
and
breaking
not
only
the
canoe
but
his
own
bones
this
meant
that
if
our
entire
outfit
were
taken
along
practically
every
bit
of
land
we
travelled
would
have
to
be
covered
twice
in
leaving
the
canoe
behind
we
of
course
should
have
to
take
chances
on
meeting
intervening
lakes
but
once
in
the
region
of
northern
michikamau
there
seemed
a
fair
chance
of
our
falling
in
with
indians
that
would
take
us
down
the
george
river
and
the
advantages
of
light
travel
were
obvious
with
winter
fast
approaching
the
stock
of
food
we
had
to
carry
would
not
weigh
us
down
the
dried
venison
had
been
reduced
to
a
few
pounds
so
that
we
had
to
eat
of
it
sparingly
and
make
our
principal
diet
on
boiled
fish
and
the
water
in
which
it
was
cooked
we
had
just
a
bit
of
flour
enough
to
serve
bread
at
rare
intervals
as
a
great
dainty
nothing
remained
of
our
caribou
tallow
and
marrow
grease
it
is
true
we
held
in
reserve
the
emergency
ration
but
this
consisted
only
of
eighteen
pounds
of
pea
meal
a
pint
of
rice
and
a
small
piece
of
bacon
this
ration
we
had
pledged
ourselves
to
use
only
in
case
of
the
direst
necessity
should
we
be
compelled
to
make
a
forced
retreat
and
we
felt
we
must
not
think
of
it
at
this
time
as
food
on
hand
in
camp
on
friday
night
i
could
see
that
hubbard
was
worrying
considerably
nervously
active
by
habit
he
found
delay
doubly
hard
the
days
we
had
spent
on
lake
disappointment
in
a
vain
search
for
a
river
had
been
particularly
trying
on
his
nerves
and
had
left
him
a
prey
to
many
fears
the
spectre
of
an
early
winter
in
this
land
began
to
haunt
him
constantly
the
days
were
slipping
away
and
were
becoming
visibly
shorter
with
each
sunset
if
we
could
get
to
the
indians
on
the
george
we
should
be
safe
for
they
would
give
us
warm
skins
for
clothing
and
replenish
our
stock
of
food
but
should
we
meet
with
more
delays
and
arrive
on
the
george
too
late
for
the
caribou
migration
and
fail
to
find
the
indians
what
then
well
then
our
fate
would
be
sealed
hubbard
was
the
leader
of
the
expedition
and
he
felt
himself
responsible
not
only
for
his
own
life
but
to
a
large
extent
for
ours
it
is
little
wonder
therefore
that
he
brooded
over
the
possibilities
of
calamity
but
with
youth
ambition
and
the
ardent
spirit
that
never
will
say
die
he
invariably
fought
off
his
fears
and
bent
himself
more
determinedly
than
ever
to
achieve
the
purpose
for
which
he
had
set
out
frequently
he
confided
his
fears
to
me
but
was
careful
to
conceal
all
traces
of
them
from
george
in
light
marching
order
we
went
out
on
saturday
morning
august
making
rapid
progress
to
the
northward
through
a
thick
growth
of
small
spruce
timber
and
over
a
low
ridge
but
scarcely
had
we
gone
a
mile
when
we
were
compelled
to
halt
there
in
front
of
us
was
a
small
lake
extending
east
and
west
it
was
not
more
than
an
eighth
of
a
mile
across
it
but
a
long
distance
around
it
back
we
went
for
the
canoe
and
at
the
same
time
brought
forward
the
whole
camp
outfit
again
we
tried
light
marching
order
and
again
a
lake
compelled
us
to
go
back
for
the
canoe
and
outfit
and
thus
it
was
all
day
a
stretch
of
a
mile
or
so
then
a
long
narrow
lake
to
cross
until
finally
we
were
forced
to
admit
that
our
plan
of
proceeding
with
light
packs
and
without
the
canoe
was
impracticable
hubbard
was
feeling
stronger
on
saturday
evening
and
we
had
a
pleasant
camp
george
made
a
big
fire
of
tamarack
and
we
lay
before
it
on
a
couch
of
spruce
boughs
and
ate
tough
boiled
venison
and
drank
the
broth
and
feeling
we
had
made
some
progress
we
were
happy
despite
the
fact
that
we
were
in
the
midst
of
a
trackless
wilderness
with
our
way
to
michikamau
and
the
indians
as
uncertain
as
ever
sunday
morning
august
broke
superbly
beautiful
and
the
day
continued
clear
and
mild
we
made
an
early
start
for
every
hour
had
become
precious
while
we
were
doing
this
work
without
any
streams
to
guide
us
it
was
george
custom
to
go
ahead
all
the
way
from
half
a
mile
to
two
miles
and
blaze
a
trail
so
that
when
we
were
travelling
back
and
forth
bringing
up
the
packs
and
the
canoe
we
might
not
go
astray
in
the
course
of
the
morning
we
came
to
two
small
lakes
which
we
paddled
over
we
had
believed
that
our
goose
chases
were
over
for
these
birds
now
having
grown
their
feathers
could
fly
and
were
generally
beyond
the
reach
of
our
pistols
and
the
uncertain
aim
of
a
rifle
at
anything
on
the
wing
for
two
days
we
had
heard
them
flying
and
now
and
then
would
see
them
high
in
the
air
but
while
we
were
crossing
one
of
the
small
lakes
this
sunday
five
geese
walked
gravely
down
the
bank
and
into
the
water
ahead
of
the
canoe
one
of
them
we
got
with
a
pistol
shot
the
others
flew
away
in
another
lake
we
reached
late
in
the
day
we
came
upon
five
or
six
ducks
they
were
not
far
away
but
dived
so
frequently
we
were
unable
to
shoot
them
with
pistol
or
rifle
a
shotgun
might
have
enabled
us
to
get
nearly
all
the
geese
as
well
as
the
ducks
and
other
game
we
saw
on
the
wing
and
in
the
water
on
other
occasions
we
often
expressed
the
regret
that
we
had
no
shotgun
with
us
at
one
time
hubbard
had
intended
that
one
should
be
taken
but
later
decided
that
the
ammunition
would
be
too
bulky
a
low
ridge
running
east
and
west
lay
just
beyond
the
small
lake
in
which
we
saw
the
ducks
towards
evening
about
seven
miles
beyond
the
ridge
to
the
north
was
a
short
range
of
high
barren
mountains
that
were
perhaps
a
trifle
lower
than
the
kipling
mountains
upon
ascending
the
ridge
we
heard
the
rushing
of
water
on
the
other
side
which
sound
proved
to
come
from
a
small
fall
on
a
stream
expanding
and
stretching
out
to
the
eastward
in
long
narrow
lakes
apparently
these
lakes
were
the
headquarters
of
a
small
river
flowing
to
the
southeast
and
in
all
probability
here
was
the
source
of
the
red
river
which
as
i
have
described
flows
into
the
nascaupee
some
fifteen
or
eighteen
miles
above
grand
lake
the
whole
character
of
the
country
had
now
changed
it
was
very
rocky
and
steadily
growing
more
barren
ridges
and
hills
extended
to
the
mountains
on
the
north
great
boulders
were
piled
in
confusion
behind
us
and
in
front
of
us
portaging
over
them
had
been
most
difficult
and
dangerous
a
misstep
might
have
meant
a
broken
leg
and
as
it
was
the
skin
had
been
pretty
nearly
all
knocked
off
of
our
shins
from
the
instep
to
the
knee
below
the
fall
we
had
discovered
was
a
deep
pool
in
which
hubbard
caught
with
his
emergency
kit
and
a
tamarack
pole
twenty
trout
averaging
twelve
inches
in
length
we
camped
near
this
pool
the
hard
work
of
the
day
had
brought
on
hubbard
another
attack
of
his
old
illness
apparently
it
was
only
by
a
great
exertion
of
that
he
kept
moving
at
all
during
the
afternoon
and
at
night
he
was
very
weak
before
supper
he
drank
a
cup
of
strong
tea
as
a
stimulant
and
was
taken
immediately
with
severe
vomiting
watching
his
suffering
the
thought
came
to
me
whether
disregarding
all
other
considerations
i
should
not
at
this
point
strongly
insist
on
the
party
turning
back
i
was
aware
however
of
the
grim
determination
of
the
man
to
get
his
work
done
and
was
convinced
of
the
uselessness
of
any
attempt
to
sway
him
from
his
purpose
moreover
i
myself
was
hopeful
of
our
ability
to
reach
the
caribou
grounds
i
felt
sure
that
hubbard
grit
would
carry
him
through
looking
back
now
i
can
see
i
should
have
at
least
attempted
to
turn
him
back
but
i
am
still
convinced
it
would
have
been
useless
i
thoroughly
believe
only
one
thing
would
have
turned
the
boy
back
at
that
time
force
after
this
vomiting
ceased
hubbard
said
he
felt
better
but
he
ate
sparingly
of
the
boiled
fish
we
had
for
supper
george
and
i
also
felt
a
bit
weak
and
our
stomachs
were
continually
crying
out
for
bread
or
some
other
grain
food
as
we
reclined
before
the
fire
hubbard
had
george
tell
us
of
various
indian
dishes
he
had
prepared
after
he
had
entered
into
these
gastronomic
details
with
great
gusto
george
suddenly
said
wouldje
believe
it
fellus
i
once
threw
away
a
whole
batch
of
cookies
no
we
both
cried
fact
said
george
for
heaven
sake
said
hubbard
why
did
you
do
it
well
said
george
it
was
when
i
first
went
cookin
in
a
camp
the
cookies
was
as
good
as
i
thought
they
ought
to
be
and
i
was
so
ashamed
of
that
i
took
the
whole
lot
out
and
buried
supposin
added
george
in
an
awed
whisper
supposin
we
had
now
why
what
in
the
world
would
you
do
with
them
asked
hubbard
um
grunted
george
well
i
guess
we
find
a
way
to
use
all
right
the
story
of
the
buried
cookies
started
us
all
to
talking
of
doughnuts
and
cake
and
pie
and
hubbard
extolled
the
merits
of
the
chocolate
served
at
one
of
the
new
york
hotels
wallace
he
at
length
asked
do
you
like
pig
knuckles
i
like
i
replied
anything
that
can
be
eaten
well
confided
hubbard
i
know
a
place
down
on
park
row
where
they
serve
the
best
pigs
knuckles
you
ever
ate
i
used
to
go
there
for
them
when
i
was
on
the
old
daily
news
they
cook
them
just
right
and
serve
a
big
plate
of
nice
greasy
cabbage
or
sauerkraut
with
them
and
a
cup
of
pretty
good
coffee
we
have
to
go
there
some
time
when
we
get
back
and
until
it
was
time
to
go
to
sleep
hubbard
continued
to
talk
of
the
good
dinners
he
had
eaten
when
a
child
and
of
those
his
wife
had
recently
prepared
at
his
congers
home
as
he
had
decided
that
before
proceeding
farther
we
should
know
something
of
the
country
that
lay
to
the
northward
hubbard
on
monday
morning
august
sent
george
on
a
scouting
trip
to
the
short
range
of
mountains
just
ahead
he
and
i
planned
to
spend
the
day
catching
and
drying
fish
for
some
reason
the
fish
refused
to
rise
near
the
camp
and
hubbard
who
was
so
weak
he
could
hardly
stand
returned
to
lie
down
while
i
went
farther
down
the
stream
towards
i
returned
with
only
two
or
three
small
fish
hubbard
was
still
resting
in
the
tent
but
soon
after
i
had
begun
to
repair
my
fishing
rod
by
the
fire
he
came
out
and
joined
me
oh
how
glad
i
be
wallace
he
said
to
get
to
michikamau
and
finish
my
work
here
and
get
home
again
i
been
wondering
when
that
will
be
i
afraid
he
added
slowly
i
been
a
bit
homesick
we
surely
get
there
soon
old
man
i
said
encouragingly
and
when
we
do
get
there
we
appreciate
it
more
than
ever
just
think
how
it
will
be
to
eat
good
bread
and
all
we
want
of
it
yes
he
said
and
then
we
be
glad
we
came
here
and
can
laugh
at
the
recollection
of
these
terrible
ridges
and
the
whole
awful
country
and
the
hard
times
we
been
through
i
dead
glad
i
had
just
you
two
fellows
come
with
me
if
i
had
a
single
man
that
growled
about
the
grub
and
work
or
wanted
to
quit
it
would
have
been
hell
but
we
have
had
a
growl
or
a
word
about
quitting
or
turning
back
there
no
reason
for
quitting
said
i
and
as
for
growling
there
no
call
for
it
we
done
the
best
we
could
and
enough
to
make
any
real
man
satisfied
that
so
said
hubbard
take
things
as
they
come
and
make
the
best
of
them
that
good
philosophy
i
was
thinking
that
here
it
is
the
last
of
august
and
we
do
know
where
we
are
and
it
bothered
me
some
as
i
lay
there
in
the
tent
but
we
done
our
best
and
ought
to
be
satisfied
in
the
afternoon
i
took
my
rod
and
went
about
three
miles
to
the
westward
where
i
came
upon
an
isolated
pond
with
no
apparent
outlet
everywhere
i
could
see
the
trout
jumping
and
by
sundown
had
as
long
a
string
of
them
as
i
could
conveniently
carry
it
was
an
hour
after
dark
when
i
reached
camp
george
had
returned
and
they
were
beginning
to
fear
that
i
was
lost
george
had
climbed
the
mountains
and
he
reported
a
fair
line
of
travel
to
the
northwest
with
a
long
lake
that
looked
like
a
river
and
some
distance
northwest
of
that
big
water
and
a
tolerably
good
route
for
portages
what
he
told
us
led
hubbard
to
decide
to
continue
on
with
the
canoe
and
our
entire
outfit
george
brought
back
with
him
two
grouse
he
had
shot
the
next
morning
tuesday
september
hubbard
was
much
better
and
we
began
september
with
a
renewed
effort
it
was
rough
and
painful
portaging
over
rocks
and
knolls
every
forty
or
fifty
rods
we
came
upon
deep
ponds
with
water
so
clear
we
could
see
the
pebbles
on
the
bottom
between
these
ponds
boulders
were
piled
indiscriminately
in
directing
our
course
to
the
northwest
we
avoided
the
mountains
that
had
lain
just
ahead
for
two
days
we
pushed
on
among
the
boulders
then
over
a
wide
marsh
and
through
a
heavy
spruce
growth
which
brought
us
on
september
to
george
lake
that
looked
like
a
river
let
us
call
it
mary
lake
along
lake
mary
we
paddled
in
the
pouring
rain
that
began
that
day
some
five
miles
to
its
western
end
and
there
near
a
creek
that
flowed
into
it
we
found
the
remains
of
an
old
indian
camp
george
looked
the
camp
over
critically
and
remarked
the
beggars
killed
two
caribou
and
they
broke
every
bone
up
and
boiled
out
the
last
drop
of
grease
what
was
it
a
summer
or
a
winter
camp
asked
hubbard
a
summer
said
george
and
they
been
fishing
too
there
a
good
fishing
place
just
try
it
we
did
try
it
and
we
had
a
fairly
good
catch
of
large
trout
for
supper
we
had
a
few
of
the
trout
boiled
together
with
the
water
with
one
spoonful
of
flour
for
each
man
stirred
in
we
ate
the
fish
entire
entrails
head
and
all
and
from
that
time
on
we
let
no
part
of
the
fish
we
caught
be
thrown
away
everything
now
in
the
way
of
food
george
divided
carefully
into
three
equal
parts
even
the
fish
broth
by
this
time
we
had
not
enough
flour
on
hand
to
make
more
than
half
a
dozen
cakes
of
bread
and
we
continued
to
use
only
a
spoonful
or
two
a
day
for
each
man
mixing
it
with
game
or
fish
broth
in
this
way
we
hoped
it
would
satisfy
to
some
extent
our
craving
for
grain
and
last
longer
as
evening
approached
the
sky
cleared
and
a
big
full
moon
tipped
the
fir
trees
with
silver
and
set
lake
mary
to
gleaming
the
air
was
filled
with
the
perfume
of
the
balsam
and
spruce
and
it
acted
as
a
tonic
on
our
spirits
and
drove
away
the
depression
of
the
day
work
in
the
rain
hubbard
seemed
to
be
as
full
of
vim
as
ever
and
all
of
us
were
quite
contented
sitting
on
the
couch
of
boughs
george
looked
up
at
the
sky
and
said
there
a
fine
indian
story
about
that
moon
of
course
hubbard
and
i
begged
that
he
tell
it
to
us
well
said
george
it
a
long
story
about
a
boy
and
girl
that
lived
together
in
a
wigwam
by
a
great
water
their
father
and
mother
were
dead
and
the
boy
had
learned
to
be
a
great
hunter
because
he
had
to
hunt
for
them
both
though
he
was
young
one
day
he
found
a
tree
that
was
very
high
and
he
climbed
it
and
told
his
sister
to
climb
it
with
him
and
they
climbed
higher
and
higher
and
as
they
climbed
the
tree
grew
taller
and
taller
and
after
a
while
they
reached
the
moon
and
then
the
boy
laid
down
to
sleep
and
after
a
while
he
woke
up
with
a
bright
light
shinin
in
his
face
it
was
the
sun
passin
that
way
the
boy
said
he
would
set
a
snare
for
the
sun
and
catch
it
and
the
next
night
he
had
his
snare
set
when
the
sun
came
and
he
caught
the
sun
and
then
it
was
always
bright
on
the
moon
there
a
lot
more
to
that
story
added
george
after
a
pause
and
i
tell
it
to
you
some
time
but
it
too
long
and
too
late
to
tell
it
unfortunately
we
never
heard
the
continuation
of
the
tale
george
often
hinted
at
interesting
folklore
stories
about
the
milky
way
and
different
stars
and
various
other
things
in
nature
but
this
was
the
nearest
approach
to
a
story
we
ever
wrung
from
him
from
our
last
camp
on
lake
disappointment
to
our
camp
at
the
western
end
of
lake
mary
we
had
travelled
about
miles
in
leaving
the
latter
camp
on
september
we
inclined
our
course
directly
west
to
reach
the
big
water
george
had
seen
from
his
mountain
during
the
next
four
days
we
encountered
bad
weather
as
evening
came
on
the
sky
would
clear
and
remain
clear
until
morning
when
the
clouds
and
rain
would
reappear
on
the
there
was
sleet
with
the
rain
and
on
the
we
had
our
first
snow
which
soon
was
washed
away
however
by
rain
our
progress
on
the
was
along
the
edge
of
a
marsh
between
two
low
wooded
ridges
and
then
over
the
marsh
and
through
several
ponds
upon
the
shore
of
one
of
which
we
camped
early
in
order
that
george
might
climb
a
hill
view
the
country
and
decide
upon
the
shortest
and
best
route
to
the
big
water
he
reported
it
about
three
miles
ahead
it
had
been
our
rule
to
defer
our
bathing
until
the
evening
chill
had
quieted
the
flies
but
now
there
was
no
need
of
that
as
the
colder
weather
had
practically
killed
them
for
the
season
about
this
time
i
noticed
that
hubbard
did
not
take
his
usual
bath
and
i
remarked
the
weather
is
getting
pretty
cold
for
bathing
in
the
open
is
it
yes
said
hubbard
but
i
would
let
that
stop
me
if
i
ashamed
of
my
bones
to
tell
you
the
truth
wallace
i
like
a
walking
skeleton
it
was
true
we
were
all
very
thin
but
our
lack
of
food
told
upon
hubbard
appearance
the
most
as
he
was
naturally
slender
the
big
water
george
thought
was
only
three
miles
away
proved
to
be
like
the
wisp
of
hay
that
is
held
before
the
donkey
nose
to
lead
him
on
day
after
day
we
floundered
through
swamps
and
marshes
over
rocky
barren
hills
and
through
thick
growths
of
willows
and
alders
and
at
the
end
of
the
day
journey
it
would
apparently
be
as
far
off
as
ever
the
explanation
was
that
in
the
rarefied
atmosphere
of
interior
labrador
distances
are
very
deceptive
when
george
reported
that
the
big
water
was
three
miles
ahead
it
must
have
been
fully
fifteen
on
the
while
crossing
the
barrens
we
came
upon
some
blueberries
and
after
eating
our
fill
we
were
able
to
gather
enough
to
supply
each
man
with
a
big
dish
of
them
for
supper
we
were
working
our
way
over
some
bluffs
on
the
afternoon
of
the
when
george
who
was
carrying
the
canoe
became
separated
from
hubbard
and
me
the
wind
was
blowing
hard
and
he
had
difficulty
in
keeping
the
boat
above
his
head
suddenly
i
heard
a
call
and
looking
back
saw
george
running
after
me
hubbard
did
not
hear
the
call
and
went
on
i
dropped
my
pack
and
waited
for
george
to
come
up
you
fellus
better
wait
for
me
he
panted
i
ca
manage
the
canoe
alone
in
the
wind
and
if
we
get
separated
i
might
strike
the
lake
one
place
and
you
somewhere
else
and
added
george
sententiously
you
fellus
have
got
the
grub
we
shouted
to
hubbard
to
wait
and
when
he
answered
george
and
i
returned
for
the
canoe
hubbard
however
kept
on
and
george
and
i
carried
the
canoe
ahead
until
we
reached
the
thick
woods
into
which
he
had
disappeared
then
george
went
back
for
my
pack
presently
we
heard
hubbard
call
from
the
depths
of
the
woods
and
a
little
later
the
sound
of
an
axe
as
we
learned
later
he
had
dropped
his
pack
and
was
blazing
a
trail
towards
us
in
order
that
he
might
find
it
again
he
was
as
nervous
as
george
had
been
over
his
narrow
escape
from
being
permanently
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
party
and
at
a
time
when
such
a
happening
would
have
had
serious
consequences
for
us
all
under
the
best
of
circumstances
the
prospect
of
being
left
alone
in
the
midst
of
that
inhospitable
wilderness
was
enough
to
appal
on
the
we
reached
a
creek
and
launched
the
canoe
hubbard
went
ahead
to
fish
below
the
rapids
in
the
creek
while
george
and
i
brought
down
the
canoe
and
outfit
making
several
short
portages
that
night
we
camped
two
miles
down
the
stream
hubbard
had
caught
by
hard
work
thirty
small
trout
half
of
which
we
ate
for
supper
we
were
still
ravenously
hungry
after
we
finished
the
trout
but
the
bag
contained
only
one
more
meal
of
venison
and
we
did
not
dare
draw
on
it
this
together
with
the
difficulty
we
were
having
in
reaching
the
big
water
set
hubbard
to
worrying
again
he
was
especially
anxious
about
the
sufficiency
of
the
material
he
had
gathered
for
a
story
fearing
that
if
he
failed
to
reach
the
caribou
grounds
there
would
not
be
enough
to
satisfy
his
publishers
i
told
him
i
thought
he
already
had
enough
for
a
story
anyway
i
said
we
reach
the
caribou
grounds
and
see
the
indians
yet
george
and
i
will
go
with
you
to
the
last
ditch
you
can
count
on
us
to
the
finish
all
right
said
hubbard
evidently
relieved
if
you
boys
sick
of
it
it
on
to
the
caribou
grounds
late
or
no
late
but
i
feel
i
got
you
fellows
in
a
tight
place
we
came
with
our
eyes
open
i
replied
and
it
not
your
fault
on
the
morning
of
september
following
our
stream
out
to
a
shoal
rocky
bay
we
reached
the
big
water
at
last
it
was
the
great
body
of
water
that
i
have
mapped
out
as
windbound
lake
forty
miles
we
had
portaged
from
lake
disappointment
we
were
practically
out
of
food
of
any
kind
looking
over
the
great
expanse
of
water
stretching
miles
away
to
the
westward
we
wondered
what
our
new
lake
had
in
store
for
us
of
hope
and
success
of
failure
and
despair
would
it
lead
us
to
michikamau
if
not
what
were
we
to
do
on
its
farther
shore
about
twenty
miles
to
the
northwest
rose
in
solemn
majesty
a
great
grey
mountain
holding
its
head
high
above
all
the
surrounding
world
it
shall
be
known
as
mount
hubbard
to
this
mountain
we
decided
to
paddle
and
view
the
country
instinctively
we
felt
that
michikamau
lay
on
the
other
side
we
launched
our
canoe
after
a
light
luncheon
of
trout
and
a
small
ptarmigan
george
had
shot
once
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
we
stopped
paddling
to
climb
a
low
ridge
near
the
shore
and
eat
cranberries
which
we
found
in
abundance
on
its
barren
top
from
the
ridge
we
could
see
water
among
the
hills
in
every
direction
in
the
large
lake
at
our
feet
were
numerous
wooded
islands
we
camped
at
dusk
on
one
of
these
islands
and
on
wednesday
september
launched
our
canoe
at
daybreak
to
resume
our
journey
to
mount
hubbard
we
reached
its
base
before
ten
blueberries
grew
in
abundance
on
the
side
of
the
mountain
which
together
with
the
country
near
it
had
been
burned
one
of
us
it
was
decided
should
remain
behind
to
pick
berries
while
the
others
climbed
to
the
summit
i
volunteered
for
the
berrypicking
but
i
shall
always
regret
it
was
not
possible
for
me
to
go
along
before
hubbard
and
george
returned
i
had
our
mixing
basin
filled
with
berries
and
the
kettle
half
full
the
day
was
clear
crisp
and
delightful
one
of
those
perfect
days
when
the
atmosphere
is
so
pure
and
transparent
that
minute
objects
can
be
distinguished
for
miles
on
the
earth
and
on
the
water
not
a
thing
of
life
was
to
be
seen
the
lake
relieved
here
and
there
with
green
the
cold
rocks
of
distant
mountains
to
the
northeast
the
low
ridges
and
hills
that
we
had
travelled
over
bounding
the
lake
to
the
eastward
and
a
ridge
of
green
hills
west
of
the
lake
that
extended
southward
from
behind
mount
hubbard
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
all
combined
to
complete
a
scene
of
vast
and
solemn
beauty
and
i
alone
on
the
mountain
side
picking
blueberries
felt
an
inexpressible
sense
of
loneliness
felt
myself
the
only
thing
of
life
in
all
that
boundless
from
the
moment
hubbard
and
george
had
left
me
i
had
not
seen
or
heard
them
but
up
the
mountain
they
went
through
the
burnt
spruce
forest
up
for
four
miles
over
rocks
up
and
up
to
the
top
and
then
to
the
westernmost
side
of
the
peak
they
went
and
looked
looked
to
the
west
and
there
only
a
few
miles
away
lay
michikamau
with
its
expanse
of
water
the
lake
we
so
long
had
sought
for
and
fought
so
desperately
to
reach
it
was
there
just
beyond
the
ridge
i
had
seen
extending
to
the
southward
x
prisoners
of
the
wind
it
was
four
in
the
afternoon
when
the
sun
was
getting
low
that
i
near
the
base
of
the
mountain
and
still
industriously
picking
berries
heard
a
shout
from
hubbard
and
george
at
the
canoe
on
the
shore
of
the
lake
below
i
was
anxious
to
hear
the
result
of
their
journey
and
hurried
down
it
there
it
there
shouted
hubbard
as
i
came
within
talking
distance
michikamau
is
there
just
behind
the
ridge
we
saw
the
big
water
we
saw
it
in
our
great
joy
we
fairly
hugged
each
other
while
george
stood
apart
with
something
of
indian
stoicism
but
with
a
broad
grin
nevertheless
expanding
his
features
we
felt
that
windbound
lake
must
be
directly
connected
with
michikamau
and
that
we
were
now
within
easy
reach
of
the
caribou
grounds
and
a
land
of
plenty
it
is
true
that
from
the
mountain
top
hubbard
and
george
had
been
unable
to
trace
out
the
connection
as
windbound
lake
was
so
studded
with
islands
and
had
so
many
narrow
arms
reaching
out
in
the
various
directions
between
low
ridges
that
their
view
of
the
waters
between
them
and
michikamau
was
more
or
less
obscured
but
they
had
no
doubt
that
the
connection
was
there
and
added
hubbard
after
i
had
heard
all
about
the
great
discovery
good
things
never
come
singly
look
there
i
looked
where
he
pointed
and
there
on
the
rocks
near
george
feet
lay
a
pile
of
ptarmigans
and
one
small
rabbit
i
picked
them
up
and
counted
them
with
nervous
joy
there
were
nine
nine
ptarmigans
and
the
rabbit
you
see
said
hubbard
reverently
god
always
gives
us
food
when
we
are
really
in
great
need
and
he
carry
us
through
that
way
in
the
wilderness
he
send
us
manna
on
similar
occasions
in
the
past
hubbard
had
made
like
remarks
to
this
and
he
continued
to
make
them
on
similar
occasions
in
the
future
invariably
they
were
made
with
a
simplicity
that
robbed
them
of
all
cant
they
came
from
the
man
real
nature
while
george
dressed
three
of
the
birds
hubbard
and
i
built
a
fire
on
the
rocks
by
the
shore
since
early
morning
when
we
had
a
breakfast
of
thin
soup
made
with
three
thin
slices
of
bacon
and
three
spoonfuls
of
flour
we
had
had
nothing
to
eat
and
our
hunger
was
such
that
while
dinner
was
cooking
we
each
took
the
entrails
of
a
bird
wrapped
them
as
george
told
us
the
indians
did
on
the
end
of
a
stick
broiled
them
over
the
fire
and
ate
them
greedily
and
when
the
ptarmigans
were
boiled
what
a
glorious
feast
we
had
in
using
a
bit
of
bacon
for
soup
in
the
morning
we
had
drawn
for
the
first
time
on
our
emergency
ration
the
situation
seemed
to
warrant
it
nevertheless
we
were
as
bent
as
ever
on
hoarding
this
precious
little
stock
of
food
at
five
we
paddled
up
the
lake
to
the
northeast
to
begin
our
search
for
the
connection
with
michikamau
hubbard
dropped
a
troll
as
we
proceeded
and
caught
two
namaycush
which
when
we
went
into
camp
at
dusk
on
a
small
island
george
boiled
entire
putting
into
the
pot
just
enough
flour
to
give
the
water
a
milky
appearance
with
this
supper
we
had
some
of
the
blueberries
stewed
and
hubbard
said
they
would
have
been
the
real
thing
if
we
only
had
a
little
sugar
for
them
all
day
on
september
we
continued
our
search
for
the
connection
with
michikamau
finally
directing
our
course
to
the
southwest
where
a
mountain
seemed
to
offer
a
view
of
the
waters
in
that
direction
it
was
dark
when
we
reached
its
base
and
we
went
into
camp
preparatory
to
climbing
to
the
summit
in
the
morning
we
had
been
somewhat
delayed
by
wind
squalls
that
made
canoeing
dangerous
and
before
we
made
camp
rain
began
to
fall
we
caught
no
fish
on
the
troll
that
day
but
hubbard
shot
a
large
at
our
evening
meal
we
ate
the
last
of
our
ptarmigans
and
rabbit
george
said
hubbard
after
we
had
eaten
our
supper
you
have
a
few
more
of
mother
dried
apples
there
how
would
it
be
to
stew
them
and
stir
in
a
little
flour
to
thicken
them
would
they
thicken
up
better
if
you
were
to
cook
them
and
let
them
stand
until
morning
guess
they
would
replied
george
there
ai
many
of
here
shall
i
put
them
all
to
cook
yes
said
hubbard
put
them
all
to
cook
and
we
eat
them
for
breakfast
with
that
small
trout
wallace
caught
and
the
two
ptarmigan
entrails
in
the
morning
september
we
drew
lots
for
the
trout
and
george
won
so
he
took
the
fish
and
hubbard
and
i
each
an
entrail
and
with
the
last
of
the
apples
before
us
that
hubbard
mother
had
dried
sat
down
to
breakfast
how
well
said
hubbard
i
remember
the
tree
on
the
old
michigan
farm
from
which
these
apples
came
and
now
he
added
i
eating
the
last
of
the
fruit
from
it
that
i
shall
probably
ever
eat
why
said
george
do
you
expect
to
get
back
to
eat
any
more
that
is
it
replied
hubbard
father
signed
a
contract
for
the
sale
of
the
farm
last
spring
and
they
to
deliver
the
property
over
to
its
new
owners
on
the
fifteenth
of
this
month
father
wanted
me
to
come
to
the
farm
and
run
it
as
he
too
old
to
do
the
work
any
longer
but
i
had
other
ambitions
i
feel
half
sorry
now
i
did
for
after
all
it
home
to
me
and
always
will
be
wherever
i
go
in
the
world
how
often
i
watched
mother
gathering
these
apples
to
dry
and
then
the
apple
butter
did
you
ever
eat
apple
butter
boys
george
had
not
but
i
had
well
continued
hubbard
there
was
an
old
woman
lived
near
us
who
could
make
apple
butter
better
than
anybody
else
mother
used
to
have
her
come
over
one
day
each
fall
and
make
a
big
lot
for
us
and
say
but
was
it
delicious
i
told
you
wallace
about
the
maple
sugaring
on
the
farm
and
you
had
some
of
the
syrup
i
brought
from
there
when
i
visited
father
and
mother
before
i
came
away
on
this
trip
we
used
to
bring
to
the
house
the
very
first
syrup
we
made
in
the
spring
while
it
was
hot
the
first
you
know
is
always
the
best
and
mother
would
have
a
nice
pan
of
red
hot
tea
biscuits
and
for
tea
she
serve
the
biscuits
with
cream
and
the
hot
new
syrup
and
sometimes
we
mix
honey
with
the
syrup
for
father
was
a
great
man
with
bees
he
kept
a
great
many
of
them
and
had
quantities
of
honey
he
had
a
special
house
where
he
kept
his
honey
and
in
which
was
a
machine
to
separate
it
from
the
comb
when
the
comb
was
not
well
filled
in
the
honey
house
on
a
table
he
always
had
a
plate
with
a
pound
comb
of
white
clover
honey
and
spoons
to
eat
it
with
and
he
invited
every
visitor
to
help
himself
once
i
remember
a
neighbour
called
on
father
and
was
duly
taken
out
to
the
honey
house
he
ate
the
whole
pound
you
have
some
more
asked
father
care
if
i
do
said
the
neighbour
so
father
set
out
another
pound
comb
which
the
neighbour
proceeded
to
put
out
of
sight
with
a
facility
fully
equal
to
that
with
which
he
demolished
the
first
some
more
said
father
said
the
neighbour
maybe
i
had
enough
i
used
to
wonder
how
the
man
ever
did
it
but
i
guess
i
myself
could
make
two
pounds
of
honey
disappear
if
i
had
it
now
hubbard
poured
some
tea
in
the
cup
that
had
contained
his
share
of
the
apple
sauce
and
after
carefully
stirring
into
the
tea
the
bit
of
sauce
that
clung
to
the
cup
he
poured
it
all
into
the
kettle
in
which
the
sauce
had
been
cooked
and
stirred
it
again
that
he
might
get
the
last
bit
of
the
apples
from
the
tree
on
that
michigan
farm
then
he
poured
it
all
back
into
his
cup
and
drank
it
i
believe
it
sweetened
the
tea
just
a
little
he
said
and
the
last
of
mother
sweet
apples
breakfast
eaten
we
had
no
dinner
to
look
forward
to
of
course
there
was
the
emergency
ration
but
we
felt
we
must
not
draw
on
that
to
any
extent
as
yet
hubbard
was
much
depressed
perhaps
because
of
his
reminiscences
of
home
and
perhaps
because
of
our
desperate
situation
we
still
had
to
find
the
way
to
michikamau
and
the
cold
rain
that
fell
this
morning
warned
us
that
winter
was
near
the
look
from
the
mountain
top
near
our
camp
revealed
nothing
owing
to
the
heavy
mist
and
rain
once
more
in
the
canoe
we
started
southward
close
to
the
shore
to
hunt
for
a
rapid
we
had
heard
roaring
in
the
distance
trolling
by
the
way
we
caught
one
namaycush
the
rapid
proved
to
be
really
a
fall
where
a
stream
emptied
into
the
lake
we
had
big
hopes
of
trout
but
found
the
stream
too
shoal
and
rapid
with
almost
no
pools
and
we
caught
only
a
dozen
small
ones
towards
evening
we
took
a
northwesterly
course
in
the
canoe
in
search
of
the
lake
outlet
to
michikamau
while
paddling
we
got
a
namaycush
which
enabled
us
to
eat
that
night
our
camp
was
on
a
island
partially
covered
with
stunted
gnarled
spruce
and
fir
trees
the
weather
had
cleared
and
the
heavens
were
bright
with
stars
when
we
drew
our
canoe
high
upon
the
shore
clear
of
the
breaking
waves
the
few
small
trout
we
had
caught
we
stowed
away
in
the
bow
of
the
canoe
as
they
were
to
be
reserved
for
breakfast
early
in
the
morning
september
we
were
awakened
by
a
northeast
gale
that
threatened
every
moment
to
carry
our
tent
from
its
fastenings
and
as
we
peered
out
through
the
flaps
rain
and
snow
dashed
in
our
faces
the
wind
also
was
playing
high
jinks
with
the
lake
it
was
white
with
foam
and
the
waves
dashing
against
the
rocks
on
the
shore
threw
the
spray
high
in
the
air
evidently
there
was
no
hope
of
launching
the
canoe
that
day
and
assuming
indifference
of
the
driving
storm
that
threatened
to
uncover
us
we
settled
down
for
a
morning
sleep
at
ten
george
crawled
out
to
build
a
fire
in
the
lee
of
some
bushes
and
boil
trout
for
a
light
breakfast
soon
he
stuck
his
head
in
the
tent
and
his
face
told
us
something
had
happened
even
before
he
said
well
that
too
bad
what
too
bad
asked
hubbard
anxiously
somebody
stole
the
trout
we
left
in
the
canoe
who
asked
hubbard
and
i
together
otter
or
somebody
maybe
a
marten
george
always
referred
to
animals
as
persons
we
all
went
again
to
look
and
make
sure
the
fish
were
not
there
somewhere
but
they
were
really
gone
and
we
looked
at
one
another
and
laughed
and
continued
to
make
light
of
it
as
we
ate
a
breakfast
of
soup
made
of
three
little
slices
of
bacon
with
two
or
three
spoonfuls
of
flour
and
rice
we
occupied
the
day
in
talking
visiting
hubbard
called
it
and
mending
hubbard
made
a
handsome
pair
of
moccasins
using
an
old
flour
sack
for
the
uppers
and
a
pair
of
skin
mittens
for
the
feet
george
did
some
neat
work
on
his
moccasins
and
clothing
and
i
made
my
trousers
look
quite
respectable
again
and
ripped
up
one
pair
of
woollen
socks
to
get
yarn
to
darn
the
holes
in
another
altogether
it
was
rather
a
pleasant
day
even
though
hubbard
display
of
his
beautiful
new
moccasins
did
savour
of
ostentation
and
thereby
excite
much
heartburning
on
the
part
of
george
and
me
our
second
day
on
the
island
was
sunday
september
we
awoke
to
find
that
the
wind
rain
and
sleet
were
still
with
us
our
breakfast
was
the
same
as
all
our
meals
of
the
previous
day
thin
bacon
soup
the
morning
we
spent
in
reading
from
the
bible
hubbard
read
philemon
aloud
and
told
us
the
story
i
read
aloud
from
the
psalms
george
who
received
his
religious
training
in
a
mission
of
the
anglican
church
on
james
bay
listened
to
our
reading
with
reverent
attention
towards
noon
the
storm
began
to
moderate
and
in
a
short
stroll
about
the
island
we
found
some
blueberries
and
currants
which
we
fell
upon
and
devoured
at
one
the
wind
abated
to
such
an
extent
that
we
succeeded
in
leaving
the
island
and
reaching
the
mainland
to
the
northeast
the
wind
continuing
to
abate
we
paddled
several
miles
in
the
afternoon
looking
in
vain
for
the
outlet
in
the
course
of
our
search
we
caught
a
namaycush
and
immediately
put
to
shore
to
eat
it
while
it
was
being
cooked
we
picked
nearly
a
gallon
of
cranberries
on
a
sandy
knoll
we
camped
near
this
spot
and
for
supper
had
a
pot
of
the
cranberries
stewed
leaving
enough
for
two
more
meals
for
several
days
past
now
when
george
and
i
were
alone
he
had
repeated
to
me
stories
of
indians
that
had
starved
to
death
or
had
barely
escaped
starvation
and
a
little
later
he
spoke
of
these
things
in
hubbard
presence
to
me
he
would
tell
how
weak
he
was
becoming
and
how
indians
would
get
weaker
and
weaker
and
then
give
up
to
it
and
die
he
also
spoke
of
how
he
had
heard
the
big
northern
loons
cry
at
night
farther
back
on
the
trail
which
cries
he
said
the
indians
regarded
as
sure
signs
of
coming
calamity
at
the
same
time
he
was
cheerful
and
courageous
never
suggesting
such
a
thing
as
turning
back
his
state
of
mind
was
to
me
very
interesting
apparently
two
natures
were
at
war
within
him
one
the
indian
was
haunted
by
superstitious
fears
the
other
the
white
man
rejected
these
fears
and
invariably
conquered
them
in
other
words
the
indian
in
him
was
panicky
but
the
white
man
held
him
fast
and
in
seeing
him
master
his
superstitious
nature
i
admired
him
the
more
until
this
time
it
had
been
hubbard
custom
to
retire
to
his
blankets
early
while
george
and
i
continued
to
toast
our
shins
by
the
fire
and
enjoy
our
evening
pipe
then
george
would
turn
in
and
i
while
the
embers
died
would
sit
alone
for
an
hour
or
so
and
let
my
fancy
form
pictures
in
the
coals
or
carry
me
back
to
other
days
in
our
sunday
night
camp
on
windbound
lake
however
hubbard
sat
with
me
long
after
george
was
lost
in
sleep
and
together
we
talked
of
the
home
folks
and
exchanged
confidences
i
observed
now
a
great
change
in
hubbard
heretofore
the
work
he
had
to
do
had
seemed
almost
wholly
to
occupy
his
thoughts
now
he
craved
companionship
and
he
loved
to
sit
with
me
and
dwell
on
his
home
and
his
wife
his
mother
and
sister
and
rehearse
his
early
struggles
in
the
university
and
in
new
york
city
undoubtedly
the
boy
was
beginning
to
suffer
severely
from
homesickness
he
was
only
a
young
fellow
you
know
with
a
gentle
affectionate
nature
that
gripped
him
tight
to
the
persons
and
objects
he
loved
our
little
confidential
talks
grew
to
be
quite
the
order
of
things
and
often
as
the
days
went
by
we
confessed
to
each
other
that
we
looked
forward
to
them
during
all
the
weary
work
hours
they
were
the
bright
spots
in
our
dreary
life
a
tremendous
gale
with
dashes
of
rain
ushered
in
monday
morning
september
again
we
were
windbound
with
nothing
to
do
but
remain
where
we
were
and
make
the
best
of
it
a
little
of
our
thin
soup
had
to
serve
for
breakfast
then
we
all
slept
till
ten
when
hubbard
and
i
went
out
to
the
fire
and
george
took
a
stroll
through
the
bush
on
the
shore
in
the
hope
of
seeing
something
to
shoot
while
i
cleaned
my
rifle
and
pistol
hubbard
and
i
chatted
about
good
things
to
eat
and
the
days
of
yore
well
wallace
he
said
i
suppose
that
father
and
mother
are
leaving
the
old
farm
forever
and
that
i
never
can
call
it
home
again
i
dreamed
of
it
last
night
over
fifty
years
ago
father
cleared
that
land
when
he
was
a
young
man
and
that
part
of
michigan
was
a
wilderness
he
made
a
great
farm
of
it
and
it
has
been
his
home
ever
since
how
i
hate
to
think
of
them
going
away
and
leaving
it
to
strangers
who
do
love
it
or
care
more
for
it
than
any
other
plot
of
ground
where
good
crops
can
be
raised
daisy
his
sister
and
i
grew
up
together
there
and
i
used
to
tell
her
my
ambitions
and
she
was
always
interested
daisy
gave
me
more
encouragement
in
my
work
than
anyone
else
in
the
world
i
never
have
done
half
so
well
with
my
work
if
it
had
been
for
daisy
after
a
moment
silence
he
continued
that
hickory
cleaning
rod
for
the
rifle
we
lost
on
a
portage
on
the
big
river
the
beaver
father
cut
himself
on
the
old
farm
and
shaped
it
and
gave
it
to
me
that
the
reason
i
hated
so
to
lose
it
if
we
go
back
that
way
we
must
try
to
find
it
father
wanted
to
come
with
me
on
this
trip
he
wanted
to
take
care
of
me
he
always
thinks
of
me
as
a
child
he
never
quite
realised
i
a
grown
man
as
old
as
he
is
i
believe
he
could
have
stood
this
trip
as
well
as
i
have
he
was
a
in
california
you
know
and
has
spent
a
lot
of
his
life
in
the
bush
when
george
returned
alas
we
had
our
dinner
the
menu
was
not
very
extensive
it
began
with
stewed
cranberries
and
ended
there
the
acid
from
the
unsweetened
berries
made
our
mouths
sore
but
as
george
remarked
it
was
a
heap
better
than
not
eatin
at
all
perhaps
i
should
say
here
that
these
were
the
hungriest
days
of
our
journey
what
we
suffered
later
on
the
good
lord
only
knows
but
we
never
felt
the
the
as
now
in
our
enforced
idleness
it
was
impossible
for
us
to
prevent
our
thoughts
from
dwelling
on
things
to
eat
and
this
naturally
accentuated
our
craving
then
again
as
everyone
that
has
had
such
an
experience
knows
the
pangs
of
hunger
are
mitigated
after
a
certain
period
has
been
passed
in
the
afternoon
george
and
i
took
the
pistols
and
ascended
a
low
ridge
in
the
rear
of
the
camp
to
look
for
ptarmigans
soon
george
exclaimed
under
his
breath
there
two
get
down
low
and
do
let
see
you
the
wind
blows
so
they
be
mighty
wild
i
belly
round
to
that
bush
over
there
and
take
a
shot
he
crawled
or
wriggled
along
to
the
bush
which
was
the
nearest
cover
and
about
forty
yards
from
the
birds
with
a
dinner
in
prospect
i
watched
him
with
keen
anxiety
i
could
see
him
lying
low
and
carefully
aiming
his
pistol
suddenly
bang
and
one
of
the
birds
fluttered
straight
up
high
in
the
air
trying
desperately
to
sustain
itself
then
fell
into
the
brush
on
the
hillside
below
at
that
george
raised
his
head
and
gave
a
peculiar
laugh
a
laugh
of
wild
exultation
an
indian
laugh
he
was
the
indian
hunter
then
i
never
heard
him
laugh
so
again
nor
saw
him
look
quite
as
he
did
at
that
moment
as
the
other
bird
flew
away
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
shouted
i
hit
did
you
see
how
he
went
now
we
find
but
we
did
we
beat
the
bushes
high
and
low
for
an
hour
and
finally
in
disappointment
and
disgust
gave
up
the
search
the
bird
lay
there
dead
somewhere
but
we
never
found
it
and
we
returned
to
camp
and
perhaps
through
anticipation
hungrier
than
ever
on
tuesday
september
the
high
west
wind
had
not
abated
and
the
occasional
continued
we
were
dreary
and
disconsolate
when
we
came
out
of
the
tent
and
huddled
close
to
the
fire
for
the
first
time
hubbard
heard
george
tell
his
stories
of
indians
that
starved
and
there
we
were
still
windbound
and
helpless
with
stomachs
crying
continually
for
food
and
the
caribou
migration
was
soon
to
begin
if
it
had
not
already
begun
and
there
seemed
no
prospect
of
the
weather
clearing
we
made
an
inventory
of
the
food
we
were
hoarding
for
an
emergency
and
found
that
in
addition
to
about
two
pounds
of
flour
we
had
eighteen
pounds
of
pea
meal
a
little
less
than
a
pint
of
rice
and
a
half
a
pound
of
bacon
george
then
told
another
story
of
indians
that
starved
at
length
he
stopped
talking
and
we
sat
silent
for
a
long
while
staring
blankly
at
the
blazing
logs
slowly
the
minutes
crawled
in
great
gusts
the
wind
swept
down
howling
dismally
among
the
trees
and
driving
the
sleet
into
our
faces
still
we
sat
cowering
in
silence
when
hubbard
arose
pushed
the
loose
ends
of
the
partially
burned
sticks
into
the
fire
and
stood
with
his
back
to
the
blaze
apparently
deep
in
thought
presently
turning
slowly
towards
the
lake
he
walked
down
through
the
intervening
brush
and
stood
alone
on
the
sandy
shore
contemplating
the
scene
before
him
the
dull
lowering
skies
the
ridges
in
the
distance
the
lake
in
its
angry
mood
protesting
against
his
further
advance
the
low
wooded
land
that
hid
the
gate
to
michikamau
haggard
gaunt
and
ragged
he
stood
there
watching
then
seemed
to
be
lost
completely
in
thought
forgetful
of
the
wind
and
weather
and
dashing
spray
finally
he
turned
about
briskly
and
with
quick
nervous
steps
pushed
through
the
brush
to
the
fire
where
george
and
i
were
still
sitting
in
silence
suddenly
and
without
a
word
of
introduction
he
said
boys
what
do
you
say
to
turning
back
xi
we
give
it
up
for
a
moment
i
was
dazed
at
the
thought
the
thought
of
turning
back
without
ever
seeing
the
indians
or
caribou
hunt
and
i
could
not
speak
george
however
soon
found
his
tongue
he
was
still
willing
to
go
on
if
need
be
and
risk
his
life
with
us
i
came
to
go
with
you
fellus
he
said
and
i
want
to
do
what
you
fellus
do
but
i
said
to
hubbard
do
you
think
it
will
be
easier
to
reach
the
indians
on
the
george
or
even
the
george
river
post
than
northwest
river
post
we
must
surely
be
near
the
indians
we
shall
probably
see
the
smoke
of
their
wigwams
when
we
reach
michikamau
it
is
likely
we
shall
find
them
camping
on
the
big
lake
either
mountaineers
or
nascaupee
and
if
we
get
to
them
they
surely
help
us
yes
answered
hubbard
if
we
get
to
them
they
help
us
but
these
miserable
westerly
and
northwesterly
gales
may
keep
us
on
these
waters
indefinitely
or
even
on
the
shore
of
michikamau
at
a
spot
where
we
may
not
be
able
to
launch
our
canoe
or
reach
the
indians
for
days
and
that
would
be
fatal
the
caribou
migration
is
surely
begun
and
perhaps
is
over
already
and
there
no
use
in
going
ahead
i
saw
his
point
and
acquiesced
i
suppose
it
best
to
turn
back
as
soon
as
the
wind
will
let
us
i
said
for
it
likely
to
subside
only
for
a
few
hours
at
a
time
at
this
season
and
perhaps
if
we
do
get
out
when
we
can
we
may
never
get
out
at
all
but
what
does
george
say
i
asked
turning
to
our
plucky
companion
oh
said
he
i
like
to
turn
back
and
i
think
it
safest
but
goin
to
stick
to
you
fellus
and
i
goin
where
you
go
well
said
hubbard
what
the
vote
shall
we
turn
back
or
go
on
turn
back
said
i
very
well
then
he
replied
quietly
that
settled
the
decision
reached
george
face
brightened
perceptibly
and
i
must
confess
we
all
felt
better
a
great
burden
seemed
to
have
been
lifted
from
our
shoulders
it
had
required
courage
for
hubbard
to
acknowledge
himself
defeated
in
his
purpose
but
the
acknowledgment
once
made
we
thought
of
only
one
thing
how
to
reach
home
most
quickly
hubbard
was
now
satisfied
that
the
record
of
our
adventures
would
make
a
bully
story
even
without
the
material
he
had
hoped
to
gather
on
the
george
and
his
mind
being
easy
on
that
point
he
discussed
with
animation
plans
for
the
homeward
trip
we
have
to
catch
some
fish
here
he
said
to
take
us
over
the
long
portage
to
lake
disappointment
we
ought
to
be
able
to
dry
a
good
bit
of
namaycush
and
on
the
way
we
probably
have
a
good
catch
of
trout
at
the
long
lake
lake
mary
and
another
good
catch
where
i
used
the
tamarack
pole
and
then
when
we
get
to
lake
disappointment
we
ought
to
get
more
namaycush
yes
said
i
and
the
berries
should
help
us
some
what
do
you
think
the
chances
of
getting
caribou
are
hubbard
asked
george
we
saw
some
comin
up
replied
george
and
there
ought
to
be
more
now
i
guess
we
find
if
we
kill
some
caribou
continued
hubbard
i
think
we
better
turn
to
and
build
a
log
shack
cure
the
meat
make
toboggans
and
snowshoes
wait
for
things
to
freeze
up
and
then
push
on
to
the
post
over
the
snow
and
ice
we
can
get
some
dogs
at
the
post
and
we
be
in
good
shape
to
push
right
on
without
delay
to
the
lawrence
it
make
a
bully
trip
and
we
have
lots
of
grub
what
would
we
need
to
get
at
the
post
george
well
said
george
we
need
plenty
of
flour
pork
lard
beans
sugar
tea
and
bakin
powder
and
we
might
take
some
condensed
milk
raisins
currants
rice
and
molasses
and
i
make
somethin
good
sometimes
that
a
good
idea
said
hubbard
whose
mouth
was
evidently
watering
even
as
mine
was
and
we
might
take
some
butter
too
and
how
would
oatmeal
go
for
porridge
do
you
think
that
would
be
bully
on
a
cold
morning
yes
assented
george
we
could
eat
molasses
on
it
or
thin
up
the
condensed
milk
we
shall
probably
have
caribou
meat
that
we
can
take
along
frozen
hubbard
went
on
frozen
caribou
meat
is
bully
it
better
than
when
it
fresh
killed
did
you
ever
eat
any
wallace
no
said
i
the
only
caribou
meat
i
ever
eaten
was
what
we
had
here
then
said
hubbard
there
a
rare
treat
in
store
for
you
the
first
i
ever
ate
was
on
my
lake
john
trip
the
indian
i
had
with
me
used
to
chop
off
pieces
of
frozen
caribou
with
an
axe
and
fry
it
with
lard
and
we
just
drink
down
the
grease
it
was
fine
it
great
said
george
well
said
hubbard
coming
back
to
the
present
i
dead
glad
decided
to
strike
for
the
post
if
this
wind
will
ever
let
up
we
must
get
at
it
and
catch
some
fish
i
lay
awake
most
of
last
night
thinking
it
all
over
and
planning
it
all
i
was
awake
most
of
the
time
too
said
george
my
feet
were
mighty
cold
there
was
no
fishing
on
the
day
we
decided
to
turn
back
as
the
wind
confined
us
to
camp
and
all
we
had
to
eat
was
rice
and
bacon
soup
but
our
anticipations
of
home
to
some
extent
overcame
the
clamour
of
our
stomachs
and
we
passed
the
time
chatting
about
the
things
we
intended
to
do
when
we
regained
god
country
i
going
to
take
a
vacation
said
hubbard
i
visit
father
and
mother
if
they
in
the
east
and
sister
daisy
and
maybe
go
to
canada
with
my
wife
and
stay
a
little
while
with
her
people
what
will
you
do
boys
i
told
of
my
plans
to
visit
various
relatives
and
then
george
described
a
trip
he
was
going
to
make
to
visit
a
sister
whom
he
had
not
seen
since
he
was
a
little
boy
closing
the
description
with
a
vivid
account
of
the
good
things
he
would
have
to
eat
and
what
he
would
cook
himself
it
was
always
so
no
matter
what
our
conversation
was
about
it
sooner
or
later
developed
into
a
discussion
of
gastronomy
in
the
evening
hubbard
had
me
make
out
a
list
of
the
restaurants
we
intended
to
visit
when
we
got
back
to
new
york
and
take
george
to
i
have
the
list
yet
but
since
my
return
i
have
never
had
the
heart
to
go
near
any
of
the
places
it
mentions
from
the
talk
about
restaurants
hubbard
suddenly
turned
to
lumber
camps
asking
george
and
me
if
we
had
ever
visited
one
we
replied
that
we
had
not
and
wondered
what
had
brought
lumber
camps
into
his
mind
we
soon
learned
you
missed
something
he
said
we
make
it
a
point
to
call
at
sandy
calder
camp
when
we
go
back
and
make
him
give
us
a
feed
of
pork
and
beans
and
molasses
to
sop
our
bread
in
they
sure
to
have
them
do
they
have
cake
and
pie
asked
george
yes
in
unlimited
quantities
and
doughnuts
too
at
least
they
used
to
in
the
michigan
lumber
camps
i
visited
that
sounds
good
i
remarked
the
pork
and
beans
and
molasses
best
of
all
when
i
was
a
boy
i
was
fond
of
bread
and
molasses
good
black
molasses
but
i
have
eaten
any
since
i
like
to
have
a
chance
at
some
now
so
should
i
said
hubbard
i
just
roll
my
bread
in
it
lumberjack
fashion
do
they
have
gingerbread
in
the
camps
asked
george
yes
said
hubbard
gingerbread
is
always
on
the
table
how
do
they
make
it
well
i
do
just
know
but
i
tell
you
what
george
if
you
want
to
know
i
ask
hubbard
to
show
you
when
we
get
home
and
i
know
she
be
delighted
to
do
it
she
the
best
cook
i
ever
knew
do
you
think
she
would
mind
oh
no
she
be
very
glad
to
do
it
you
must
stop
at
our
house
for
a
while
before
you
go
back
to
missanabie
and
she
will
teach
you
to
cook
a
good
many
things
and
so
our
conversation
continued
until
we
turned
to
our
blankets
and
sought
the
luxury
of
sleep
i
to
dream
i
was
revelling
in
a
stack
of
gingerbread
as
high
as
a
house
that
my
sisters
had
baked
to
welcome
me
home
to
our
dismay
the
northwest
gale
continued
to
blow
almost
unceasingly
during
the
next
few
days
sometimes
towards
evening
the
wind
would
moderate
sufficiently
to
permit
us
to
troll
with
difficulty
along
the
lee
shore
of
an
island
but
seldom
were
we
rewarded
with
more
than
a
single
namaycush
and
so
far
from
our
getting
enough
fish
to
carry
us
over
our
long
portage
to
lake
disappointment
we
did
not
catch
enough
for
our
daily
needs
and
were
compelled
to
draw
on
our
little
store
of
emergency
provisions
on
wednesday
september
we
ate
the
last
bit
of
bacon
and
the
last
handful
of
rice
we
had
so
carefully
hoarded
we
succeeded
that
day
in
reaching
the
rapid
where
we
caught
the
few
trout
that
some
animal
stole
from
us
and
there
we
camped
from
this
point
we
believed
we
could
more
readily
gain
the
bay
where
we
had
entered
the
lake
and
begin
our
retreat
when
the
wind
subsided
the
canada
jay
a
carrion
bird
about
the
size
of
a
robin
that
is
generally
known
through
the
north
as
the
whiskey
jack
had
always
hovered
about
our
camps
and
been
very
tame
when
in
the
earlier
days
of
our
trip
we
had
refuse
to
throw
away
but
now
these
birds
called
at
us
from
a
greater
distance
seeming
to
know
we
were
looking
at
them
with
greedy
eyes
george
told
us
that
their
flesh
had
saved
many
an
indian
from
starvation
and
that
the
indians
looked
upon
them
with
a
certain
veneration
and
would
kill
them
only
in
case
of
the
direst
need
our
compunctions
against
eating
carrion
birds
had
entirely
disappeared
and
the
course
of
the
whiskey
jacks
in
holding
aloof
from
camp
when
they
were
most
needed
used
to
make
george
furious
see
the
blamed
beggars
he
would
ejaculate
just
look
at
been
feedin
right
long
and
now
when
it
their
turn
to
feed
us
look
at
go
on
thursday
september
george
got
his
revenge
stealthily
he
crept
upon
a
whiskey
jack
in
the
bush
and
shot
it
with
a
pistol
they
pretty
tough
he
said
upon
returning
with
his
prize
to
camp
and
will
take
a
long
time
to
cook
we
did
not
care
for
that
we
ate
that
bird
bones
and
all
stewed
in
a
big
pot
of
water
with
two
or
three
spoonfuls
of
flour
and
an
equal
amount
of
pea
meal
that
was
our
breakfast
we
had
no
luncheon
for
although
we
spent
the
entire
day
trolling
up
and
down
the
lee
shore
it
was
not
until
evening
that
we
caught
any
fish
the
wind
was
icy
and
set
us
all
our
hands
were
benumbed
by
the
cold
water
and
we
were
just
beginning
to
despair
when
we
landed
a
namaycush
and
a
little
later
a
then
wet
to
the
skin
and
chilled
to
the
bone
we
paddled
back
to
camp
to
cheer
ourselves
up
with
a
good
fire
and
a
supper
of
of
the
larger
fish
a
dish
of
stewed
sour
cranberries
and
plenty
of
hot
tea
i
feel
more
satisfied
every
time
i
think
of
our
decision
to
turn
back
said
hubbard
as
with
supper
eaten
we
reclined
comfortably
before
the
fire
i
had
a
pretty
hard
night
of
it
though
on
monday
for
i
hated
to
turn
back
without
seeing
the
indians
i
was
awake
thinkin
about
it
too
said
george
i
told
you
about
havin
cold
feet
and
that
they
kept
me
awake
he
paused
and
we
felt
that
something
was
coming
at
length
out
it
came
well
they
did
but
that
wind
out
in
the
lake
kept
me
awake
more
than
the
cold
feet
i
knew
that
wind
was
makin
the
huntin
good
down
the
bay
the
game
was
comin
down
there
now
and
the
young
fellus
i
used
to
hunt
with
had
been
wishin
for
this
very
wind
that
was
keepin
us
here
and
they
were
glad
to
see
it
and
were
out
shootin
waveys
a
species
of
wild
goose
and
here
we
boys
was
up
against
it
for
sure
hubbard
and
i
had
to
laugh
at
george
confession
and
we
joked
him
a
little
about
being
homesick
well
said
hubbard
we
soon
get
away
now
this
wind
must
let
up
some
time
talking
about
the
bay
reminds
me
that
i
want
to
arrange
for
a
trip
to
hudson
bay
next
summer
i
want
a
nice
easy
trip
that
i
can
take
hubbard
on
i
like
to
go
up
early
and
return
in
the
fall
and
maybe
get
some
wavey
shooting
could
you
get
one
or
two
good
men
besides
yourself
to
go
with
us
george
george
said
he
thought
he
could
and
after
hubbard
had
invited
me
to
make
one
of
the
party
they
went
into
minute
details
as
to
the
food
they
would
take
with
them
planning
an
elaborate
culinary
outfit
just
before
george
went
to
bed
hubbard
and
i
using
the
trees
that
stood
close
to
the
fire
for
a
support
stretched
a
tarpaulin
over
our
heads
to
shelter
us
from
the
rain
and
sleet
beyond
the
circle
of
our
fire
the
darkness
was
profound
as
the
wind
in
great
blasts
swept
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
its
voice
was
raised
to
piercing
shrieks
that
gradually
died
away
into
low
moans
we
thought
of
the
vast
wilderness
lying
all
about
us
under
the
pall
of
a
moonless
and
starless
night
where
had
all
the
people
in
the
world
gone
to
anyway
but
sitting
there
on
our
couch
of
boughs
beneath
the
tarpaulin
in
the
grateful
warmth
of
the
flames
we
found
it
very
cosey
and
we
talked
of
the
places
and
persons
that
were
somewhere
beyond
the
solitudes
you
do
mind
sitting
here
for
a
while
and
chatting
do
you
said
hubbard
it
very
cold
and
shivery
in
the
tent
was
a
word
we
had
picked
up
from
the
newfoundland
fishermen
who
habitually
use
it
in
addressing
one
another
be
the
person
addressed
old
or
young
at
first
hubbard
and
i
called
each
other
in
jest
but
gradually
it
became
with
us
a
term
almost
of
endearment
no
i
answered
i
would
much
rather
be
out
here
with
you
than
in
the
tent
i
was
thinking
said
hubbard
of
how
i
loved
in
the
evening
after
dinner
last
winter
to
sit
before
the
wood
fire
in
our
grate
at
congers
and
watch
the
blaze
with
mina
hubbard
near
me
what
a
feeling
of
quiet
and
peace
and
contentment
would
come
to
me
then
i
forget
all
about
the
grind
at
the
office
and
the
worries
of
the
day
that
real
happiness
wallace
a
good
wife
and
a
cheerful
fireside
what
does
glory
and
all
that
amount
to
after
all
i
let
my
work
and
my
ambition
bother
me
too
much
i
hardly
taken
time
for
my
meals
in
the
morning
i
hurry
through
breakfast
and
run
for
my
train
i
have
given
my
wife
and
my
home
the
attention
they
deserve
that
wife
of
mine
wallace
deserves
a
great
deal
of
attention
always
thinking
of
my
comfort
and
doing
things
to
please
me
and
cooking
things
i
like
but
i
must
be
boring
you
with
all
this
talk
about
my
own
affairs
no
i
said
i
like
to
hear
about
them
i
always
been
interested
in
witnessing
how
happy
you
and
your
wife
have
been
together
she
been
a
good
wife
to
me
wallace
and
as
time
has
gone
on
since
our
marriage
we
grown
closer
and
closer
together
i
see
you
like
every
other
man
that
gets
a
good
wife
you
found
the
real
key
to
the
house
of
a
man
happiness
that
so
a
single
man
or
a
man
with
an
uncongenial
wife
whom
he
does
love
and
who
does
love
him
may
be
as
rich
as
croesus
and
gain
all
the
honours
in
the
world
and
he
wo
possess
an
atom
of
the
happiness
of
a
poor
man
congenially
married
did
i
ever
tell
you
about
the
day
i
was
married
the
trouble
i
had
i
do
remember
that
you
did
although
i
suspected
something
unusual
on
foot
i
did
hear
of
your
marriage
until
after
the
deed
was
done
you
did
take
me
into
your
confidence
you
know
that
was
because
we
had
never
camped
together
then
if
we
had
camped
together
i
have
told
you
all
about
it
mina
and
i
had
not
intended
to
get
married
so
soon
we
were
to
have
been
married
in
the
spring
but
that
january
i
received
an
assignment
for
a
trip
through
the
south
and
i
knew
it
would
keep
me
away
until
after
our
wedding
date
i
did
want
to
postpone
the
wedding
so
i
decided
if
i
could
get
mina
consent
to
make
my
trip
our
honeymoon
she
was
at
her
parents
home
in
canada
and
there
was
no
time
to
lose
and
i
telegraphed
asking
her
to
come
on
at
once
and
get
married
she
was
a
brick
and
consented
and
then
i
was
in
such
a
nervous
state
of
anticipation
i
was
afraid
the
folks
where
i
was
stopping
would
discover
something
was
up
so
the
day
before
i
expected
mina
to
arrive
i
ran
over
to
jersey
to
spend
the
night
with
my
old
friend
shepard
the
minister
well
mina
train
was
due
at
the
grand
central
station
early
in
the
morning
and
i
had
to
catch
a
train
from
jersey
a
little
after
five
to
meet
her
i
was
afraid
i
oversleep
and
i
kept
awake
nearly
all
night
long
before
the
train
was
due
i
was
down
at
the
station
and
took
a
seat
in
the
waiting
room
and
what
do
you
suppose
i
did
what
said
i
why
said
hubbard
with
a
cheerful
grin
i
fell
to
thinking
so
hard
about
what
was
going
to
happen
that
i
sat
there
in
the
station
and
let
the
train
i
was
so
afraid
to
lose
come
and
go
without
ever
hearing
it
under
the
tarpaulin
there
in
the
interior
of
labrador
hubbard
and
i
laughed
heartily
and
was
the
kept
waiting
i
asked
no
said
hubbard
i
hustled
over
a
couple
of
miles
to
another
line
and
got
a
train
there
and
as
mina
fortunately
did
arrive
as
early
as
expected
i
was
in
time
the
fire
had
died
down
and
the
darkness
was
beginning
to
close
in
upon
us
i
arose
to
renew
the
fire
and
when
the
logs
had
begun
to
blaze
again
and
i
had
resumed
my
seat
i
saw
that
the
drawn
and
haggard
look
had
returned
to
hubbard
face
and
that
he
was
staring
wistfully
out
over
the
fire
into
the
impenetrable
gloom
what
is
it
i
said
that
was
a
great
trip
wallace
that
southern
trip
i
want
to
visit
some
of
the
places
again
with
mina
and
live
over
our
honeymoon
and
he
went
on
yes
i
want
some
more
of
the
good
southern
cooking
you
ought
to
eat
their
cornbread
wallace
there
nothing
like
it
anywhere
else
in
the
world
they
cook
corn
meal
in
a
dozen
ways
from
corn
pone
to
really
delicate
dishes
and
they
know
how
to
cook
chickens
too
their
chickens
and
yams
and
cornbread
are
great
it
makes
my
mouth
water
to
think
of
even
the
meals
i
eaten
in
the
mountaineers
cabins
wild
hog
good
and
greasy
wild
honey
hoecake
and
strong
black
coffee
when
i
get
home
i
going
to
experiment
in
camp
with
cooking
corn
meal
and
i
got
an
idea
that
a
young
sucking
pig
roasted
before
the
fire
like
george
roasted
the
goose
would
be
great
there
we
were
plunged
once
more
into
a
discussion
about
food
and
it
was
after
midnight
when
the
talk
about
roasting
pigs
and
stuffing
pigs
and
baking
this
and
baking
that
came
to
an
end
even
then
hubbard
was
loath
to
seek
the
tent
it
was
so
cold
and
shivery
but
he
expressed
himself
as
being
fairly
comfortable
when
he
had
followed
my
example
and
toasted
himself
thoroughly
before
the
fire
immediately
before
turning
in
with
a
pair
of
socks
on
his
feet
that
had
been
hung
up
to
warm
on
friday
september
a
fierce
northwest
gale
again
kept
us
on
the
lee
shore
and
all
we
got
on
the
troll
was
a
namaycush
hubbard
and
i
also
fished
conscientiously
at
the
rapid
near
which
we
were
still
camping
and
our
combined
efforts
yielded
us
only
two
trout
and
a
trout
trying
as
we
were
to
get
fish
ahead
for
our
long
portage
it
was
most
depressing
despite
the
steady
gnaw
gnaw
at
the
pit
of
our
stomachs
we
had
cut
down
our
meals
to
the
minimum
amount
of
food
that
would
keep
us
alive
we
were
so
weak
we
no
longer
were
sure
where
our
feet
were
going
to
when
we
put
them
down
but
all
the
fish
we
had
to
smoke
was
two
or
three
and
on
friday
night
we
ate
the
last
bit
of
our
flour
it
was
used
to
thicken
the
water
in
which
we
boiled
for
supper
some
entrails
a
namaycush
head
and
the
two
little
trout
we
had
caught
during
the
day
all
that
night
the
northwest
gale
was
accompanied
by
gusts
of
rain
and
snow
on
saturday
september
the
mercury
dropped
to
degrees
and
the
air
was
raw
not
a
single
fish
were
we
able
to
catch
george
and
i
smoked
a
pipe
for
breakfast
while
hubbard
imbibed
the
atmosphere
a
bit
of
the
smoked
fish
we
had
hoped
to
keep
boiled
with
a
dash
of
pea
meal
in
the
water
did
us
for
luncheon
and
supper
heretofore
we
had
slept
each
rolled
in
his
own
blanket
but
it
was
so
cold
in
the
tent
that
night
we
had
to
make
a
common
bed
by
spreading
one
blanket
beneath
us
on
a
tarpaulin
and
lying
with
the
other
two
blankets
drawn
over
us
the
blankets
were
decidedly
narrow
for
three
men
to
get
under
and
it
was
necessary
for
us
to
lie
very
close
together
indeed
but
our
new
method
enabled
us
to
keep
fairly
warm
and
we
continued
its
use
on
sunday
september
the
temperature
dropped
to
and
the
squalls
continued
in
desperation
we
broke
camp
in
the
morning
and
tried
to
cross
the
lake
with
our
outfit
but
the
wind
soon
drove
us
back
to
shelter
while
we
were
out
on
the
lake
we
caught
a
namaycush
on
the
troll
and
this
fish
we
had
for
luncheon
together
with
some
cranberries
we
found
on
a
ridge
near
where
we
had
taken
refuge
on
the
shore
a
little
later
i
was
attacked
with
vomiting
and
faintness
when
i
tried
to
swing
an
axe
i
reeled
and
all
but
lost
consciousness
late
in
the
afternoon
the
squalls
subsided
and
we
made
another
attempt
to
escape
from
the
prison
in
which
we
were
slowly
starving
fortunately
the
wind
continued
fair
and
there
were
no
and
on
and
on
we
paddled
in
the
direction
of
home
oh
the
great
relief
of
it
for
nearly
two
weeks
we
had
been
held
on
that
dreadful
lake
day
after
day
the
relentless
storm
had
raged
while
hunger
leered
at
us
and
tormented
us
with
its
insistent
clamour
as
we
with
soaked
rags
and
shivering
bodies
strove
vainly
to
prevent
the
little
stock
of
food
from
diminishing
that
we
felt
was
our
only
hold
on
life
and
now
we
were
going
home
darkness
had
long
since
fallen
when
we
reached
an
island
near
the
point
where
we
had
entered
the
lake
in
a
driving
rain
we
pitched
our
camp
for
supper
we
had
the
last
of
the
little
stock
of
fish
that
we
had
been
able
to
dry
this
meant
that
in
addition
to
our
stock
of
tea
the
only
food
we
had
left
on
hand
was
sixteen
pounds
of
pea
meal
but
we
did
not
worry
we
were
going
home
and
on
monday
morning
september
though
the
wind
was
again
blowing
a
gale
and
the
passage
among
the
rocks
was
filled
with
risk
we
paddled
over
to
the
mainland
ready
to
begin
our
race
for
life
down
the
trail
we
had
fought
so
hard
to
ascend
xii
the
beginning
of
the
retreat
upon
reaching
the
mainland
we
stopped
to
assort
and
dry
our
baggage
all
of
us
felt
we
had
entered
upon
a
race
against
starvation
and
everything
that
was
not
strictly
necessary
to
aid
our
progress
to
northwest
river
post
we
threw
away
in
addition
to
many
odds
and
ends
of
clothing
we
abandoned
about
three
pounds
of
tea
tea
was
the
one
thing
of
which
we
had
carried
an
abundance
and
though
we
had
used
it
freely
we
had
more
than
we
deemed
necessary
to
carry
us
through
while
we
were
nearing
the
shore
we
sighted
three
little
ducklings
bobbing
up
and
down
in
the
tumbling
waves
and
repeatedly
diving
they
were
too
far
off
to
reach
with
a
pistol
and
hubbard
took
his
rifle
it
seemed
almost
like
attacking
a
fly
with
a
cannon
but
with
our
thoughts
on
grub
none
of
us
was
impressed
with
its
incongruity
then
after
hubbard
had
fired
two
or
three
shots
one
of
the
ducklings
suddenly
turned
over
we
paddled
to
it
with
feverish
haste
and
found
that
it
had
been
stunned
by
a
ball
that
had
barely
grazed
its
bill
it
was
a
lucky
shot
for
if
the
bullet
had
gone
through
the
body
there
would
have
been
little
left
of
it
to
eat
while
george
and
i
were
drying
the
camp
equipment
hubbard
caught
five
small
trout
in
the
stream
that
emptied
into
the
lake
at
this
point
the
stream
we
had
followed
down
these
fish
we
ate
for
luncheon
once
more
ready
to
start
we
pushed
up
the
stream
to
the
place
where
we
had
last
camped
before
reaching
the
lake
and
there
we
again
pitched
our
tent
for
supper
we
made
soup
of
the
duckling
it
was
almost
like
coming
home
to
reach
this
old
camping
ground
and
it
cheered
us
considerably
the
first
day
of
the
portage
we
had
to
make
before
reaching
fairly
continuous
water
had
been
as
a
whole
depressing
rain
accompanied
by
a
cold
wind
began
to
fall
early
in
the
afternoon
the
weather
was
so
cold
in
fact
that
the
trout
would
not
rise
after
we
caught
the
five
near
the
lake
and
this
made
us
uneasy
as
to
how
the
fishing
would
prove
farther
down
the
trail
the
day
journey
moreover
had
made
it
clear
in
spite
of
our
efforts
to
hide
the
fact
from
one
another
that
we
were
much
weaker
than
when
we
last
had
made
portages
we
had
reached
the
stage
where
none
of
us
could
carry
the
canoe
alone
decidedly
we
were
not
the
same
men
that
had
set
out
so
blithely
from
the
post
eight
weeks
before
as
for
myself
i
had
shortened
my
belt
thirteen
inches
since
july
it
became
the
custom
now
for
george
and
me
to
go
ahead
with
the
canoe
for
a
mile
or
so
while
hubbard
brought
forward
in
turn
each
of
the
three
packs
for
about
an
eighth
of
a
mile
then
george
and
i
would
return
to
him
and
each
taking
a
pack
we
would
advance
to
the
place
where
the
canoe
had
been
left
sometimes
however
this
routine
was
varied
hubbard
now
and
then
helping
george
with
the
canoe
while
i
juggled
with
the
packs
until
they
returned
to
me
despite
the
fact
that
we
had
fewer
as
well
as
lighter
packs
to
carry
than
on
the
up
trail
our
progress
was
slower
because
of
our
increasing
weakness
whereas
it
had
taken
us
three
days
on
the
up
trail
to
portage
the
fifteen
miles
between
lake
mary
and
windbound
lake
it
now
took
us
five
days
to
cover
the
same
ground
on
tuesday
the
the
second
day
of
our
portage
it
rained
all
the
time
and
for
the
greater
part
of
the
day
we
floundered
through
marshes
and
swamps
we
caught
no
fish
and
killed
no
game
hubbard
tried
to
stalk
a
goose
in
a
swamp
wading
above
his
knees
in
mud
and
water
to
get
a
shot
but
he
finally
had
to
fire
at
such
long
range
that
he
missed
and
the
bird
flew
away
to
our
great
disappointment
our
food
consisted
of
half
a
pound
of
pea
meal
for
each
man
during
the
day
hubbard
had
an
attack
of
vomiting
and
at
night
when
we
reached
our
second
camping
ground
above
the
lake
we
were
all
miserable
and
thoroughly
soaked
though
still
buoyed
up
by
the
knowledge
that
we
were
going
home
the
cold
rain
continued
on
the
until
late
in
the
day
when
the
sky
cleared
and
evening
set
in
cold
and
crisp
that
day
i
was
attacked
with
vomiting
our
food
was
the
same
as
on
the
day
previous
with
the
addition
of
some
mossberries
and
cranberries
we
found
on
the
barren
ridge
over
which
we
crossed
it
was
another
day
of
hard
portaging
on
stomachs
crying
for
food
and
when
we
pitched
our
camp
we
were
so
exhausted
that
we
staggered
like
drunken
men
silent
and
depressed
we
took
our
places
on
the
seat
of
boughs
that
george
had
prepared
by
the
roaring
fire
but
after
we
had
eaten
our
meagre
supper
and
drunk
our
tea
and
our
clothes
had
begun
to
dry
in
the
genial
glow
we
found
our
tongues
again
and
half
forgetting
that
starving
and
desperate
we
were
still
in
the
midst
of
the
wilderness
far
from
human
help
we
once
more
talked
of
the
homes
that
were
calling
to
us
over
the
dreary
wastes
talked
of
the
dear
people
that
would
welcome
us
back
and
of
the
good
things
they
would
give
us
to
eat
talked
until
far
into
the
night
dreading
to
go
to
the
cold
tent
and
the
wet
blankets
we
awoke
on
the
morning
of
the
to
find
six
inches
of
snow
on
the
ground
and
the
storm
still
raging
with
the
temperature
down
to
soon
after
we
began
plodding
through
the
snow
on
a
breakfast
george
left
us
to
hunt
geese
the
night
before
he
had
told
hubbard
he
would
kill
a
goose
in
the
morning
if
he
were
permitted
to
go
on
with
a
rifle
he
had
heard
the
geese
flying
and
believed
they
had
alighted
for
the
night
in
a
small
lake
some
distance
ahead
the
knowledge
that
he
was
a
famous
goose
hunter
down
the
bay
made
his
confidence
impressive
still
we
were
doubtful
about
his
succeeding
in
his
quest
for
the
geese
had
been
so
hard
to
approach
of
late
we
were
beginning
to
fear
we
should
never
shoot
any
more
for
half
an
hour
after
george
had
taken
his
pack
and
a
rifle
and
gone
on
hubbard
and
i
slowly
followed
his
trail
through
the
snow
then
in
the
distance
we
heard
a
bang
and
after
a
short
interval
bang
bang
three
shots
in
all
he
seen
them
said
hubbard
and
shot
one
said
i
i
not
so
sure
of
that
returned
hubbard
i
afraid
they
flew
and
he
tried
to
wing
them
and
if
that
the
case
the
chances
are
against
him
presently
we
came
upon
george
pack
near
the
western
end
of
the
little
lake
and
we
stopped
and
anxiously
waited
for
him
to
appear
in
a
few
moments
he
came
you
can
kick
me
he
began
with
apparent
disgust
then
observing
the
look
of
keen
disappointment
upon
hubbard
haggard
face
he
quickly
changed
his
tone
that
all
right
fellus
he
said
i
got
a
goose
i
saw
out
there
fifty
yards
from
shore
and
i
bellied
along
through
the
brush
as
close
as
i
dared
and
fired
and
knocked
one
over
then
the
others
flew
out
about
two
hundred
yards
farther
and
i
thought
chance
another
shot
for
if
i
did
try
i
would
get
another
and
if
i
did
i
might
knock
one
over
so
i
shot
again
and
did
get
another
then
the
rest
of
the
flock
rose
up
and
i
tried
to
wing
one
but
missed
and
they
gone
now
but
there
two
dead
ones
out
in
the
lake
joy
the
word
fails
to
express
our
feeling
george
and
i
hurried
back
for
the
canoe
and
when
we
paddled
out
there
sure
enough
were
the
two
geese
one
dead
and
the
other
helpless
with
a
broken
wing
george
ended
the
life
of
the
wounded
goose
with
a
pistol
and
we
paddled
back
to
our
packs
and
built
a
big
fire
in
the
lee
of
a
thick
clump
of
trees
the
snow
had
turned
into
a
fierce
driving
rain
but
that
did
not
bother
us
to
dress
the
geese
did
not
take
long
we
put
the
giblets
and
entrails
to
boil
immediately
and
to
quiet
our
impatience
while
waiting
for
them
to
cook
george
cut
from
the
necks
a
piece
of
skin
and
fat
for
each
of
us
these
we
warmed
on
the
end
of
a
stick
taking
great
care
not
to
heat
them
enough
to
permit
a
single
drop
of
the
oil
to
escape
from
the
fat
then
half
raw
as
they
were
we
ate
them
down
greedily
and
found
them
delicious
it
was
really
wonderful
how
much
happiness
that
bit
of
game
brought
us
as
we
were
eating
the
giblets
and
entrails
and
drinking
the
broth
we
freely
admitted
that
never
before
had
we
sat
down
to
such
a
banquet
and
remarked
hubbard
just
think
how
original
is
our
menu
i
bet
there
is
a
menu
in
new
york
that
contains
boiled
goose
entrails
on
the
the
fierce
northwest
gale
still
blew
and
the
air
was
again
filled
with
snow
but
still
we
pushed
onward
let
the
wind
blow
and
the
snow
and
rain
come
as
they
liked
they
could
not
stop
us
we
were
going
home
we
portaged
this
day
to
another
of
our
old
camps
by
a
small
lake
on
the
evening
before
we
had
eaten
the
wings
and
feet
of
the
geese
boiled
for
breakfast
we
had
half
a
goose
for
luncheon
we
had
pea
soup
and
at
night
we
had
the
other
half
of
the
goose
left
over
from
the
morning
we
scorched
the
bones
in
the
fire
and
ate
even
them
these
meals
did
not
begin
to
satisfy
our
appetites
but
they
were
sufficient
to
give
us
a
little
new
life
while
we
were
sitting
around
the
fire
hubbard
wished
me
to
promise
to
spend
thanksgiving
day
with
him
that
year
if
we
reached
home
in
time
for
two
years
i
had
spent
the
day
at
his
home
and
thanksgiving
he
said
must
be
our
reunion
day
always
no
matter
what
happened
we
must
always
make
a
special
effort
to
spend
that
day
together
in
the
years
to
come
we
must
never
drift
apart
we
were
brothers
comrades
more
than
brothers
we
had
endured
the
greatest
hardships
together
had
fought
our
way
through
that
awful
country
together
had
starved
together
and
never
had
there
been
misunderstanding
never
a
word
of
dissension
from
this
time
on
we
talked
less
about
what
we
should
eat
when
we
reached
civilisation
true
we
would
sometimes
lapse
into
restaurant
and
talks
but
we
fought
against
it
as
much
as
possible
realising
that
to
permit
our
thoughts
to
dwell
on
good
things
to
eat
accentuated
our
distress
gradually
we
talked
more
and
more
of
childhoods
days
and
incidents
long
forgotten
came
vividly
before
us
it
was
a
psychological
phenomenon
i
can
not
account
for
but
it
was
the
case
with
all
of
us
hubbard
george
and
myself
during
these
trying
times
we
had
one
source
of
amusement
which
because
it
was
the
only
one
was
all
the
more
valued
and
taken
advantage
of
i
refer
to
our
appearance
george
had
shaved
once
since
we
had
gone
into
the
country
but
neither
hubbard
nor
i
had
known
the
caress
of
a
razor
since
we
left
the
post
on
july
none
of
us
had
felt
the
loving
touch
of
the
scissors
upon
his
hair
since
leaving
new
york
in
june
and
our
heads
were
shaggy
masses
of
more
or
less
dishevelled
and
tangled
locks
exposure
to
sun
and
storm
and
the
smoke
of
campfires
had
covered
our
faces
with
a
deep
coat
of
brown
our
eyes
were
sunken
deep
into
their
sockets
our
lips
were
drawn
to
thin
lines
over
our
teeth
the
skin
of
our
faces
and
hands
was
stretched
tight
over
the
bones
we
were
almost
as
thin
and
almost
the
colour
of
the
mummies
one
sees
in
museums
as
for
our
clothing
it
was
still
hanging
upon
us
and
that
is
about
all
that
can
be
said
of
it
our
trousers
full
of
rents
were
tied
together
with
pieces
of
fish
line
the
bottoms
of
our
moccasins
were
so
hopelessly
gone
that
we
had
our
feet
wrapped
in
rags
with
pieces
of
fishline
tied
around
what
remained
of
the
uppers
our
flannel
shirts
were
full
of
rents
around
our
necks
we
wore
red
bandanna
handkerchiefs
our
soft
felt
hats
had
become
shapeless
things
so
full
of
rents
that
if
it
were
not
for
the
bandanna
handkerchiefs
we
wore
in
them
our
hair
would
have
protruded
at
every
point
frequently
we
would
picture
ourselves
walking
into
our
homes
or
through
the
streets
of
new
york
as
we
then
were
and
laugh
at
the
thought
wallace
hubbard
would
say
the
cops
would
let
you
walk
a
block
they
run
you
in
sure
you
the
most
individual
i
ever
saw
by
long
odds
and
i
would
retort
i
make
a
good
second
to
you
for
you
the
worst
that
ever
happened
it
was
on
saturday
morning
the
that
we
reached
the
western
end
of
lake
mary
and
completed
fifteen
miles
of
our
portage
we
pitched
our
tent
as
we
had
done
before
on
the
site
of
the
old
indian
camp
near
the
brook
george
had
pointed
out
as
a
good
fishing
place
the
rain
and
wind
continued
in
the
morning
but
at
midday
the
sun
came
out
and
we
were
able
to
dry
our
blankets
always
we
waited
for
the
sun
to
dry
the
blankets
for
we
had
had
so
many
articles
of
clothing
burned
while
hanging
before
the
fire
we
did
not
dare
to
trust
the
blankets
near
it
while
we
were
following
our
old
trail
to
the
lake
hubbard
decapitated
a
duck
with
a
rifle
bullet
and
we
went
into
camp
with
high
hopes
of
more
food
in
the
way
of
fish
hubbard
rod
was
hopelessly
broken
so
he
took
mine
now
much
wound
with
linen
thread
but
still
usable
if
not
very
pliable
and
while
i
made
camp
and
george
prepared
the
duck
for
luncheon
he
caught
twenty
trout
of
fair
size
which
caused
our
spirits
to
run
high
luncheon
over
hubbard
resumed
his
fishing
and
i
stole
away
with
my
rifle
along
the
marshes
in
the
hope
of
seeing
a
caribou
when
i
returned
towards
dusk
without
having
sighted
any
game
i
found
a
stage
over
the
fire
and
george
hanging
up
trout
to
dry
hubbard
it
appeared
had
caught
more
our
exultation
knew
no
bounds
we
had
not
dreamed
of
any
such
catch
as
that
by
remaining
in
camp
and
fishing
another
day
we
should
at
this
rate
be
able
to
dry
nearly
enough
trout
to
see
us
through
to
lake
disappointment
we
were
as
happy
and
as
free
from
care
as
children
our
great
success
here
made
us
feel
sure
that
down
below
where
we
had
caught
so
many
fish
on
our
inbound
journey
we
should
again
get
plenty
all
we
should
need
in
fact
and
our
safety
seemed
assured
we
admitted
we
had
felt
doubts
as
to
the
outcome
which
we
had
not
expressed
out
of
consideration
for
one
another
but
now
we
felt
we
could
look
forward
to
reaching
home
as
a
certainty
and
feeling
freer
to
indulge
our
fancies
our
talk
at
once
returned
to
the
good
things
we
were
going
to
eat
sunday
the
was
warm
and
clear
with
a
southwest
wind
and
everything
seemed
favourable
for
more
fish
for
breakfast
we
ate
the
last
of
our
goose
and
for
luncheon
trout
entrails
and
roe
while
george
and
i
were
drying
fish
during
the
forenoon
hubbard
caught
fifty
more
one
big
fellow
had
sores
all
over
his
body
and
we
threw
it
aside
towards
noon
the
fish
ceased
to
rise
the
pool
probably
being
fished
out
after
luncheon
i
again
left
camp
with
my
rifle
in
the
vain
hope
of
sighting
a
caribou
the
gloom
of
night
was
beginning
to
gather
when
i
returned
as
i
approached
stepping
noiselessly
on
the
mossy
carpet
of
the
forest
i
saw
hubbard
sitting
alone
by
the
fire
mending
his
moccasins
something
in
his
attitude
made
me
pause
he
was
bareheaded
and
his
long
unkempt
hair
hung
half
way
down
to
his
shoulders
as
he
sat
there
in
the
red
glow
of
the
fire
with
the
sombre
woods
beyond
and
the
lonely
stretch
of
lake
below
and
i
took
note
of
his
emaciated
form
and
his
features
so
haggard
and
drawn
i
seemed
for
the
first
time
to
realise
fully
the
condition
to
which
the
boy
had
been
brought
by
his
sufferings
and
while
i
stood
there
still
unobserved
i
heard
him
softly
humming
to
himself
rock
of
ages
cleft
for
me
let
me
hide
myself
in
thee
how
strangely
the
old
hymn
sounded
among
those
solitudes
after
a
little
i
again
started
to
advance
and
as
i
stepped
upon
a
dry
branch
hubbard
stopped
his
singing
and
looked
up
quickly
wallace
he
exclaimed
i
glad
to
see
you
george
and
i
have
been
having
a
long
sunday
talk
and
we
missed
you
we
were
wishing
come
no
luck
no
said
i
nothing
but
old
trails
not
a
fresh
track
anywhere
what
were
you
talking
about
we
had
a
chapter
from
the
bible
and
a
little
talk
about
it
i
been
thinking
about
my
class
of
boys
in
the
at
congers
and
how
glad
i
be
to
get
back
to
them
again
i
a
lot
i
want
to
tell
them
it
restful
just
to
think
of
that
little
church
and
this
sunday
afternoon
i
been
thinking
about
it
a
good
deal
george
was
lying
in
the
tent
and
hubbard
and
i
joined
him
and
continued
our
conversation
there
hubbard
spoke
of
the
luck
we
had
had
in
catching
trout
saying
it
god
way
of
taking
care
of
us
so
long
as
we
do
our
best
it
was
wonderful
to
see
how
as
his
body
became
weaker
his
spirit
grew
brighter
steadily
he
became
more
gentle
and
affectionate
the
more
he
suffered
the
more
his
faith
in
the
god
of
his
youth
seemed
to
increase
early
the
next
morning
september
george
who
was
the
first
to
be
stirring
poked
his
head
into
the
tent
and
with
an
air
of
mystery
asked
me
for
my
pistol
a
moment
later
we
heard
a
shot
hubbard
and
i
both
looked
out
to
see
george
returning
with
empty
hands
and
an
expression
of
deep
chagrin
what
are
you
shooting
at
now
asked
hubbard
the
blackest
marten
i
ever
saw
said
george
i
knocked
him
over
but
he
got
on
his
feet
again
and
was
into
the
lake
and
away
before
i
could
reach
him
the
beggar
was
right
here
in
camp
tryin
to
make
off
with
that
fish
with
sores
we
threw
away
he
might
have
made
good
eatin
if
we
got
him
as
the
day
was
squally
with
snow
and
a
heavy
wind
was
kicking
up
a
sea
on
the
lake
we
decided
to
remain
in
camp
another
day
and
smoke
the
fish
a
little
more
while
we
kept
the
smoke
going
under
the
stage
we
sat
by
the
fire
and
chatted
the
day
rations
consisted
of
three
fish
for
each
man
at
each
of
the
three
meals
by
way
of
a
little
variety
we
roasted
some
of
the
fish
on
sticks
we
were
all
very
weak
but
george
explained
that
away
the
indians
he
said
always
go
to
pieces
after
they
been
hard
up
for
a
while
and
finally
get
grub
then
they
feed
up
and
get
strong
again
it
the
grub
comin
all
of
a
sudden
that
makes
you
weak
your
mind
feelin
easier
you
feel
you
ca
do
anything
hubbard
and
i
agreed
that
george
was
right
our
minds
certainly
had
relaxed
homeward
bound
with
enough
fish
on
hand
to
last
us
for
several
days
we
had
no
doubts
as
to
the
future
we
decided
however
that
whatever
the
weather
conditions
in
the
morning
might
be
we
should
break
camp
and
push
on
with
the
greatest
possible
speed
as
it
was
the
part
of
wisdom
to
make
our
supply
of
fish
carry
us
down
the
back
trail
as
far
as
possible
so
we
went
to
our
blankets
more
than
eager
for
the
morning
start
and
more
confident
we
should
get
out
safely
than
at
any
time
since
we
began
the
retreat
xiii
hubbard
grit
two
things
soon
became
plain
after
our
struggle
back
to
the
post
was
resumed
one
was
that
winter
was
fast
closing
in
upon
us
the
other
was
that
hubbard
condition
was
such
as
might
well
cause
the
gravest
concern
the
morning
that
we
broke
camp
on
lake
mary
tuesday
september
was
ushered
in
by
a
gale
from
the
west
and
driving
snow
the
mercury
had
dropped
to
and
all
of
us
were
when
we
issued
from
the
tent
while
george
and
i
were
preparing
the
outfit
for
travel
hubbard
caught
twelve
trout
in
the
pool
on
the
lake
we
encountered
as
heavy
a
sea
as
our
little
canoe
could
weather
and
we
had
to
struggle
hard
for
an
hour
to
reach
the
farther
shore
upon
landing
hubbard
was
again
attacked
with
diarrhoea
george
and
i
carried
the
packs
up
the
high
bank
to
a
sheltered
spot
in
the
woods
but
when
i
returned
to
hubbard
he
insisted
on
helping
me
to
carry
the
canoe
up
the
steep
ascent
we
laboured
and
then
as
we
put
the
canoe
down
hubbard
said
i
dead
tired
and
weak
boys
i
think
i
have
to
take
a
little
rest
after
building
him
a
roaring
log
fire
george
and
i
carried
the
canoe
a
mile
and
a
half
ahead
through
the
driving
snow
which
was
of
the
wet
kind
that
clings
to
every
bush
and
tree
robing
the
woods
in
a
pure
and
spotless
white
that
inevitably
suggests
fairyland
but
i
was
not
in
a
mood
to
admire
the
beauty
of
it
all
upon
our
return
to
hubbard
he
announced
that
we
should
have
to
camp
where
we
were
for
the
day
that
he
might
have
time
to
recuperate
the
delay
affected
him
keenly
we
should
eat
nearly
as
much
food
in
our
idleness
as
we
should
in
moving
onward
and
the
thought
of
drawing
on
our
pounds
of
dried
fish
without
making
progress
was
anything
but
pleasant
the
wintry
weather
did
not
worry
us
for
we
knew
the
snow
then
falling
would
disappear
before
the
ground
became
covered
for
good
and
we
felt
sure
we
should
reach
the
susan
valley
before
time
in
which
event
ice
would
assist
rather
than
retard
our
progress
as
even
with
the
susan
river
open
it
would
be
impossible
to
use
the
canoe
in
its
shoal
rapid
waters
as
for
hubbard
condition
i
suppose
it
worried
me
more
than
anyone
else
george
had
failed
to
note
the
signs
of
increasing
weakness
in
our
leader
that
i
had
and
hubbard
himself
was
so
under
the
influence
of
his
indomitable
spirit
that
for
a
long
time
he
apparently
did
not
realise
the
possibility
of
an
utter
collapse
by
the
campfire
that
night
he
was
confident
we
should
be
able
to
make
up
the
next
day
for
the
delay
caused
by
his
weakness
for
a
long
time
he
sat
silently
gazing
into
the
fire
but
as
he
had
just
been
expressing
a
longing
to
see
his
wife
if
only
for
a
moment
i
knew
he
did
not
see
the
blaze
before
him
he
was
looking
into
another
fire
a
big
wood
fire
in
an
fireplace
in
the
cheerful
of
a
congers
home
and
his
wife
was
by
his
side
he
put
out
his
arm
to
draw
her
closer
to
him
i
could
see
it
all
and
understand
understand
the
look
of
perfect
happiness
that
his
picture
brought
to
his
face
but
when
george
arose
to
throw
some
more
logs
on
the
fire
the
shower
of
sparks
that
flew
heavenward
brought
him
suddenly
back
to
reality
to
the
woods
of
labrador
i
hope
we
shall
be
able
to
find
another
house
in
congers
with
a
fireplace
such
as
our
old
one
had
he
said
turning
to
me
as
if
he
knew
i
had
been
reading
his
thoughts
in
the
evening
we
sit
long
before
the
fire
without
lighting
a
lamp
sometimes
we
make
believe
we
camping
and
make
our
tea
and
broil
some
bacon
or
melt
some
cheese
for
our
crackers
over
the
coals
and
have
a
jolly
time
i
want
you
to
visit
us
often
and
join
us
in
those
teas
and
see
if
you
do
find
them
as
delightful
as
we
do
the
next
morning
september
hubbard
said
he
was
much
better
and
gave
the
order
to
advance
we
made
a
short
march
camping
just
beyond
the
long
swamp
on
the
edge
of
the
country
we
had
found
so
hard
to
traverse
on
the
upward
trail
on
the
way
we
stopped
for
a
pot
of
tea
at
a
place
in
the
swamp
where
we
had
previously
camped
and
there
discovered
a
treasure
namely
the
bones
of
a
caribou
hoof
we
had
used
in
making
soup
we
seized
upon
the
bones
eagerly
put
them
in
the
fire
and
licked
the
grease
off
them
as
it
was
drawn
out
by
the
heat
then
we
cracked
them
and
devoured
the
bit
of
grease
we
found
inside
it
was
agreed
that
from
this
point
george
and
i
should
carry
the
canoe
about
two
miles
ahead
while
hubbard
carried
the
packs
to
a
convenient
place
beyond
the
swamps
and
there
pitched
camp
it
was
about
dusk
when
george
and
i
after
a
laborious
struggle
among
the
boulders
and
brush
put
the
canoe
down
and
turned
back
as
we
approached
the
place
that
had
been
selected
for
a
camp
we
looked
expectantly
for
the
glow
of
the
fire
but
none
was
to
be
seen
at
length
we
heard
axe
strokes
and
came
upon
hubbard
cutting
wood
he
greeted
us
with
rather
a
wan
smile
i
been
slow
boys
he
said
i
have
got
the
firewood
cut
yet
nor
the
boughs
for
the
bed
i
only
just
pitched
the
tent
i
get
the
other
axe
i
said
quickly
and
help
you
while
george
builds
the
fire
no
no
he
protested
you
get
the
boughs
while
i
getting
the
wood
i
can
get
the
boughs
after
we
have
the
wood
chopped
it
wo
take
me
long
and
you
must
let
me
help
you
at
that
hubbard
said
thank
you
in
a
tone
of
great
relief
then
he
added
slowly
i
still
a
bit
weak
and
it
hard
to
work
fast
it
was
the
first
time
since
we
left
the
post
that
he
consented
to
anyone
doing
any
part
of
his
share
of
the
work
it
is
true
that
since
we
had
turned
back
i
had
been
relieving
him
of
his
share
of
carrying
the
canoe
but
i
was
able
to
do
so
only
by
telling
him
i
much
preferred
toting
the
boat
to
juggling
with
the
packs
from
this
time
on
however
he
consented
with
less
resistance
to
george
or
myself
doing
this
or
that
while
he
rested
by
the
fire
the
fact
was
he
had
reached
the
stage
where
he
was
kept
going
only
by
his
grit
october
began
with
tremendous
gales
and
a
driving
rain
mixed
with
sleet
that
removed
all
traces
of
the
snow
the
sleet
stung
our
faces
and
we
frequently
had
to
take
refuge
from
the
blasts
in
the
lee
of
bushes
and
trees
so
as
to
recover
our
breath
but
we
managed
to
advance
our
camp
three
miles
on
the
first
pitching
the
tent
on
the
shore
of
one
of
the
limpid
ponds
among
the
boulders
for
supper
we
ate
the
last
of
the
dried
fish
which
again
left
us
with
only
the
diminishing
stock
of
pea
meal
and
none
of
us
did
much
talking
when
we
crouched
about
the
fire
on
friday
october
with
high
hopes
of
getting
fish
we
hurried
ahead
with
our
packs
to
the
pool
where
hubbard
had
caught
the
big
trout
with
his
emergency
kit
and
the
tamarack
pole
and
near
which
we
had
camped
for
a
day
while
he
rested
and
george
made
a
trip
to
the
mountains
from
which
he
discovered
lake
mary
and
windbound
lake
the
sight
of
the
old
camping
place
brought
back
to
me
the
remembrance
of
how
sick
hubbard
had
been
there
a
month
before
and
how
the
thought
had
come
to
me
to
try
to
make
him
give
up
the
struggle
the
weather
was
very
unfavourable
for
trouting
a
cold
west
wind
was
blowing
accompanied
by
snow
squalls
but
hubbard
caught
two
within
a
few
minutes
and
george
boiled
them
with
a
bit
of
pea
meal
for
luncheon
then
leaving
hubbard
to
try
for
more
fish
george
and
i
went
back
to
the
canoe
while
we
were
returning
to
camp
george
shot
a
duck
with
my
rifle
it
was
a
very
fat
black
duck
and
we
gloated
long
over
its
fine
condition
only
three
more
trout
rewarded
afternoon
work
however
we
had
duck
for
supper
and
were
nearer
home
and
that
comforted
us
i
remember
that
while
we
sat
by
the
fire
that
evening
george
produced
from
somewhere
in
the
recesses
of
his
pockets
a
new
york
central
railroad
timetable
on
which
was
printed
a
buffet
lunch
menu
and
handed
it
to
us
with
the
suggestion
that
we
give
our
orders
for
breakfast
hubbard
examined
it
and
quickly
said
give
me
a
glass
of
cream
some
graham
gems
marmalade
oatmeal
and
cream
a
jelly
omelette
a
sirloin
steak
lyonnaise
potatoes
rolls
and
a
pot
of
chocolate
and
you
might
bring
me
also
he
added
a
plate
of
griddle
cakes
and
maple
syrup
every
dish
on
that
menu
card
from
end
to
end
we
thoroughly
discussed
our
ultimate
conclusion
being
that
each
of
us
would
take
a
full
portion
of
everything
on
the
list
and
might
repeat
the
order
it
was
on
this
evening
also
that
while
calculating
the
length
of
time
it
would
take
us
to
travel
from
point
to
point
on
our
back
trail
we
began
the
discussion
as
to
whether
it
would
be
better
to
stick
to
the
canoe
on
the
big
river
the
beaver
and
follow
it
down
to
its
mouth
wherever
that
might
be
or
abandon
the
canoe
at
the
place
where
we
had
portaged
into
the
river
from
lake
elson
and
make
a
dash
overland
with
light
packs
to
the
susan
valley
and
down
that
valley
to
the
cabins
we
had
seen
at
the
head
of
grand
lake
where
we
hoped
we
might
find
a
cache
of
provisions
hubbard
was
strongly
in
favour
of
the
latter
plan
while
george
and
i
favoured
the
former
as
the
reader
knows
i
had
a
great
dread
of
the
susan
valley
and
expressed
my
feelings
freely
but
we
all
had
the
idea
that
the
big
river
emptied
into
goose
bay
the
extreme
western
end
of
hamilton
inlet
and
hubbard
reasoned
that
we
might
reach
the
broad
waters
of
the
bay
far
from
a
house
be
windbound
indefinitely
and
die
of
starvation
on
the
shore
on
the
other
hand
we
were
sure
of
the
route
through
the
susan
valley
and
in
his
opinion
it
would
be
better
to
bear
the
ills
we
had
borne
before
than
fly
to
others
we
know
not
of
i
can
not
deny
that
his
argument
had
weight
but
we
decided
that
for
the
present
we
should
hold
the
matter
in
abeyance
one
thing
we
felt
reasonably
sure
of
and
that
was
we
should
get
fish
in
the
big
river
and
we
eagerly
counted
the
days
it
would
take
us
to
reach
it
bright
and
cold
and
crisp
was
saturday
morning
october
with
black
clouds
and
occasional
snow
squalls
later
in
the
day
about
noon
when
hubbard
had
gone
ahead
with
a
pack
george
and
i
sighted
two
small
black
ducks
while
we
were
canoeing
across
a
pond
they
were
quietly
swimming
about
fifty
yards
in
front
of
us
i
passed
my
rifle
ahead
to
george
he
carefully
knelt
in
the
canoe
and
took
a
deliberate
aim
while
i
held
my
breath
then
crack
went
the
rifle
and
but
one
duck
rose
on
the
wing
quick
as
a
flash
without
removing
the
rifle
from
his
shoulder
george
threw
the
lever
forward
and
back
instantly
the
rifle
again
spoke
and
the
bird
in
the
air
tumbled
over
and
over
into
the
water
the
first
duck
had
been
decapitated
the
other
received
a
bullet
through
its
body
the
moment
was
intense
for
we
had
only
a
little
fish
for
breakfast
and
the
outlook
for
other
meals
had
seemed
dismal
indeed
but
george
was
stoicism
itself
not
a
word
did
he
utter
nor
did
a
feature
of
his
face
change
when
after
picking
up
the
ducks
we
touched
the
shore
i
jumped
out
took
his
hand
and
said
george
you
a
wonder
but
he
only
grinned
in
his
way
and
remarked
we
needed
tying
the
birds
legs
together
he
slung
them
over
his
shoulder
and
proudly
we
marched
to
the
place
where
hubbard
was
awaiting
us
to
make
his
heart
glad
with
our
good
fortune
one
of
the
ducks
we
ate
on
the
spot
and
the
other
we
had
for
supper
at
our
camp
by
a
little
pond
among
the
moonlit
hills
the
thermometer
registered
only
degrees
above
zero
on
sunday
morning
october
but
there
was
not
a
cloud
in
the
sky
and
we
should
have
enjoyed
the
crisp
clear
air
had
it
not
been
for
the
spectre
of
starvation
all
the
food
we
had
besides
the
pea
meal
was
two
of
the
fish
hubbard
had
caught
two
days
before
one
of
these
we
ate
for
breakfast
boiled
with
a
little
pea
meal
our
old
trail
led
us
up
during
the
forenoon
to
the
shore
of
one
of
the
larger
of
the
small
lakes
with
which
the
country
abounded
this
lake
we
crossed
with
difficulty
being
compelled
to
break
the
ice
ahead
of
the
canoe
with
our
paddles
on
the
opposite
shore
we
stopped
to
make
a
fire
for
tea
that
was
all
we
thought
we
should
have
for
luncheon
just
tea
george
stepped
into
the
timber
to
get
wood
and
in
a
moment
returned
and
asked
me
for
my
pistol
i
saw
a
partridge
in
there
he
said
quietly
presently
hubbard
and
i
heard
the
pistol
crack
and
we
counted
at
short
intervals
four
shots
there
something
up
said
hubbard
and
we
started
to
our
feet
just
as
george
came
in
view
with
a
grin
on
his
face
and
four
in
his
hand
he
always
did
those
things
in
that
quiet
way
two
of
the
birds
george
cooked
immediately
and
as
he
served
to
each
an
equal
share
hubbard
said
boys
we
should
thank
the
lord
for
this
food
it
has
seemed
sometimes
i
know
as
if
he
had
forgotten
us
but
he
has
not
just
now
when
we
needed
food
so
much
he
gave
us
these
partridges
let
us
thank
him
so
we
bowed
our
heads
for
a
moment
we
three
gaunt
ragged
men
sitting
there
by
our
fire
in
the
open
with
the
icy
lake
at
our
backs
and
the
dark
wilderness
of
fir
trees
before
us
during
the
afternoon
we
bagged
two
more
grouse
hubbard
shot
them
as
they
fluttered
up
before
him
on
the
trail
and
a
meal
on
the
morrow
was
assured
the
day
work
practically
completed
our
portage
for
we
camped
at
night
on
the
first
little
lake
north
of
lake
disappointment
it
was
well
that
we
had
about
reached
fairly
continuous
water
none
of
us
would
have
been
able
to
stand
much
longer
the
strain
of
those
rough
portages
day
after
day
fortunate
as
we
had
been
in
getting
game
at
critical
moments
since
leaving
windbound
lake
the
quantity
of
food
we
had
eaten
was
far
below
that
which
was
necessary
to
sustain
the
strength
of
men
who
had
to
do
hard
physical
work
it
had
become
so
that
when
we
tried
to
sit
down
our
legs
would
give
way
and
we
would
tumble
down
hubbard
was
failing
daily
he
habitually
staggered
when
he
walked
and
on
this
last
day
of
our
long
portage
he
came
near
going
all
to
pieces
nervously
when
he
started
to
tell
me
something
about
his
wife
sister
he
could
not
recall
her
name
although
it
had
been
perfectly
familiar
and
this
and
other
lapses
of
memory
appeared
to
frighten
him
for
a
long
time
he
sat
very
still
with
his
face
buried
in
his
hands
doubtless
striving
to
rally
his
forces
and
the
most
pitiable
part
of
it
was
his
fear
that
george
and
i
should
notice
his
weakness
and
lose
courage
but
he
rallied
rallied
so
as
again
to
become
the
inspirer
of
george
and
me
he
who
was
the
weakest
physically
of
the
three
xiv
back
through
the
ranges
in
our
camp
on
the
first
little
lake
north
of
lake
disappointment
we
ate
on
monday
morning
october
the
last
of
the
grouse
we
had
killed
on
the
previous
day
and
when
we
started
forward
we
again
were
down
to
the
precious
little
stock
of
pea
meal
in
a
storm
of
snow
and
rain
we
floundered
with
the
packs
and
canoe
through
a
deep
marsh
until
once
more
we
stood
on
the
shore
of
the
big
lake
where
we
had
spent
the
weary
days
searching
for
a
river
lake
disappointment
we
built
a
fire
on
the
shore
to
dry
our
rags
and
warm
ourselves
for
we
were
soaked
through
and
shivering
with
the
cold
then
we
launched
the
canoe
and
paddled
eastward
late
in
the
afternoon
we
landed
on
an
island
that
contained
a
knoll
but
which
otherwise
was
wooded
with
small
spruce
on
the
knoll
we
found
an
abundance
of
mossberries
and
soon
after
we
had
devoured
them
we
happened
upon
a
supper
in
the
form
of
two
george
and
hubbard
each
shot
one
the
sun
journey
across
the
sky
was
becoming
noticeably
shorter
and
shorter
and
before
we
had
realised
that
the
day
was
spent
night
began
to
close
in
upon
us
and
we
pitched
camp
on
the
island
in
the
morning
october
our
breakfast
flew
right
into
camp
george
crawled
out
early
to
build
a
fire
and
a
moment
later
stuck
his
head
in
the
tent
with
the
words
your
pistol
wallace
i
handed
it
out
to
him
and
almost
immediately
we
heard
a
shot
then
george
reappeared
holding
up
another
this
grub
came
right
to
us
he
said
i
knocked
the
beggar
over
close
by
the
fire
while
we
were
eating
the
bird
hubbard
told
us
he
had
been
dreaming
during
the
night
of
home
nearly
every
day
now
we
heard
that
he
had
been
dreaming
the
night
before
of
his
wife
or
his
mother
they
were
always
giving
him
good
things
to
eat
or
he
was
going
to
good
dinners
with
them
it
had
rained
hard
during
the
night
but
with
early
morning
there
came
again
the
mixture
of
rain
and
snow
we
had
endured
on
the
day
before
when
we
put
off
in
the
canoe
we
headed
for
the
point
where
we
expected
to
make
the
portage
across
the
neck
of
land
that
separated
lake
disappointment
from
lost
trail
lake
but
soon
we
were
caught
by
a
terrific
gale
and
for
half
an
hour
we
sat
low
in
the
canoe
doing
our
best
with
the
paddles
to
keep
it
headed
to
the
wind
and
no
one
speaking
a
word
the
foam
dashed
over
the
sides
of
our
little
craft
soaking
us
from
head
to
foot
tossed
violently
about
by
the
big
seas
we
for
a
time
expected
that
every
moment
would
be
our
last
had
george
been
less
expert
with
the
stern
paddle
we
surely
should
have
been
swamped
as
it
was
we
managed
after
a
desperate
struggle
to
gain
the
lee
side
of
a
small
rocky
island
upon
which
we
took
refuge
at
length
the
wind
abated
and
the
lake
became
calmer
and
venturing
out
once
more
we
made
for
the
mainland
some
distance
to
the
west
of
where
we
had
intended
to
make
our
portage
there
we
stumbled
upon
a
river
of
considerable
size
flowing
in
a
southwesterly
direction
from
lake
disappointment
into
lost
trail
lake
this
river
we
had
missed
on
the
up
trail
and
here
had
lost
the
old
indian
trail
to
michikamau
i
volunteered
to
take
my
rifle
and
hunt
across
the
neck
of
land
separating
the
two
lakes
while
hubbard
and
george
ran
the
rapids
but
presently
i
heard
them
calling
to
me
and
returning
to
the
river
found
them
waiting
on
the
bank
we
camp
just
below
here
for
the
night
said
hubbard
and
finish
the
river
in
the
morning
i
could
manage
my
end
of
the
canoe
in
a
rapid
we
were
shooting
and
we
got
on
a
rock
you
better
shoot
the
rapids
with
george
after
this
i
suppose
hubbard
weakness
prevented
him
from
turning
the
canoe
quickly
enough
when
occasion
required
and
he
realised
it
all
we
had
to
eat
that
night
was
a
little
thin
soup
made
from
the
pea
meal
and
an
even
smaller
quantity
had
to
serve
us
for
breakfast
in
the
morning
october
we
shot
the
rapids
without
incident
down
into
lost
trail
lake
and
turning
to
the
eastward
were
treated
to
a
delightful
view
of
the
kipling
mountains
now
and
but
appearing
to
us
so
much
like
old
friends
that
it
did
our
hearts
good
to
see
them
it
was
an
ideal
indian
summer
day
the
sun
shining
warmly
down
from
a
cloudless
sky
looking
at
the
peaks
that
bounded
the
horizon
in
front
of
me
i
thought
of
the
time
when
i
had
stood
gazing
at
them
from
the
other
side
and
of
the
eagerness
i
had
felt
to
discover
what
lay
hidden
beyond
something
hidden
go
and
find
it
go
and
look
behind
the
ranges
something
lost
behind
the
ranges
lost
and
waiting
for
you
go
well
we
had
gone
and
we
had
found
what
lay
hidden
behind
the
ranges
but
were
we
ever
to
get
out
to
tell
about
it
we
stopped
on
the
shore
of
lost
trail
lake
to
eat
some
cranberries
and
mossberries
the
mossberries
having
been
frozen
were
fairly
sweet
and
they
modified
to
some
extent
the
acid
of
the
cranberries
so
that
taken
together
they
made
a
luncheon
for
which
we
in
our
great
need
were
duly
grateful
after
eating
as
many
of
the
berries
as
our
stomachs
would
hold
we
were
able
to
pick
a
pan
of
them
to
take
with
us
paddling
on
we
passed
through
the
strait
connecting
lost
trail
lake
with
lake
hope
and
recalling
with
grim
smiles
the
enthusiastic
cheers
we
had
sent
up
there
a
few
weeks
before
sped
rapidly
across
lake
hope
to
the
entrance
of
our
old
mountain
pass
camping
for
the
night
on
a
ridge
near
the
old
sweat
holes
of
the
medicine
men
our
supper
consisted
of
a
little
more
pea
soup
and
half
of
the
panful
of
berries
while
we
were
lying
under
the
blankets
at
night
it
was
the
custom
for
a
man
who
got
tired
of
lying
on
one
side
to
say
turn
which
word
would
cause
the
others
to
flop
over
immediately
usually
without
waking
on
this
night
however
i
said
turn
over
and
as
we
all
flopped
hubbard
who
had
been
awake
remarked
that
makes
me
think
of
the
turnovers
and
the
spicerolls
mother
used
to
make
for
me
and
then
he
and
i
lay
for
an
hour
and
talked
of
the
baking
days
at
the
homes
of
our
childhood
talks
like
this
were
not
infrequent
are
you
awake
hubbard
would
ask
yes
i
would
reply
and
so
we
would
begin
if
we
happened
to
arouse
george
which
was
not
usual
hubbard
would
insist
on
his
describing
over
and
over
again
the
various
indian
dishes
he
had
prepared
weak
as
we
were
upon
leaving
lake
hope
october
we
did
an
heroic
day
work
we
portaged
the
entire
six
miles
through
the
mountain
pass
camping
at
night
on
the
westernmost
of
the
lakes
that
constitute
the
headwaters
of
the
beaver
river
once
more
on
the
other
side
of
the
ranges
we
did
this
on
a
breakfast
of
pea
soup
and
the
rest
of
our
berries
and
a
luncheon
of
four
little
trout
that
hubbard
caught
in
the
stream
that
flows
through
the
pass
i
shot
a
spruce
grouse
in
the
pass
and
this
bird
we
divided
between
us
for
supper
it
was
a
terrible
day
the
struggle
through
the
brush
and
up
the
steep
inclines
with
the
packs
and
the
canoe
so
exhausted
me
that
several
times
i
seemed
to
be
on
the
verge
of
a
collapse
and
i
found
it
hard
to
conceal
my
condition
once
hubbard
said
to
me
speak
stronger
put
more
force
in
your
voice
it
so
faint
george
surely
notice
it
and
it
may
scare
him
that
was
always
the
way
with
hubbard
despite
his
own
pitiable
condition
he
was
always
trying
to
help
us
on
and
give
us
new
courage
as
a
matter
of
fact
his
own
voice
was
getting
so
weak
and
low
that
we
frequently
had
to
ask
him
to
repeat
and
the
day
ended
in
a
bitter
disappointment
on
our
uptrail
we
had
had
a
good
catch
of
trout
at
the
place
where
the
stream
flowing
out
of
the
pass
fell
into
the
lake
near
our
camp
and
it
was
the
hope
of
another
good
catch
there
that
kept
us
struggling
on
to
reach
the
end
of
the
pass
before
night
but
hubbard
whipped
the
pool
at
the
foot
of
the
fall
in
vain
not
a
single
fish
rose
the
day
had
been
bright
and
sunshiny
but
the
temperature
was
low
and
the
fish
had
gone
to
deeper
waters
it
was
a
dismal
camp
the
single
grouse
we
had
for
supper
served
only
to
increase
our
craving
for
food
and
there
we
were
with
less
than
two
pounds
of
pea
meal
on
hand
and
the
fish
deserting
us
more
than
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
from
the
post
at
northwest
river
by
the
fire
hubbard
again
talked
of
home
i
dreamed
last
night
he
said
that
you
and
i
wallace
were
very
weak
and
very
hungry
and
we
came
all
at
once
upon
the
old
farm
in
michigan
and
mother
was
there
and
she
made
us
a
good
supper
of
hot
tea
biscuits
with
maple
syrup
and
honey
to
eat
on
them
and
how
we
ate
and
ate
but
george
customary
grin
was
missing
in
silence
he
took
the
tea
leaves
from
the
kettle
and
placed
them
on
a
flat
stone
close
by
the
fire
and
in
silence
he
occasionally
stirred
them
with
a
twig
that
he
broke
from
a
bush
at
his
back
at
length
the
tea
leaves
having
dried
sufficiently
he
filled
his
pipe
from
them
and
i
filled
my
pipe
we
had
not
had
any
tobacco
to
smoke
for
many
days
the
silence
continued
on
my
right
sat
george
his
cheeks
sunken
his
eyes
deep
down
in
their
sockets
his
long
black
hair
falling
over
his
ears
there
he
sat
stiffly
erect
puffing
his
tea
leaves
with
little
apparent
satisfaction
and
gazing
stoically
into
the
fire
i
could
guess
what
was
passing
through
his
mind
the
stories
of
the
indians
that
starved
on
my
left
was
hubbard
he
had
assumed
the
attitude
that
of
late
had
become
characteristic
when
he
was
dreaming
of
his
wife
and
his
mother
and
his
home
his
elbows
were
resting
on
his
knees
and
his
hands
were
supporting
his
head
his
long
hair
hid
his
bony
fingers
and
framed
his
poor
wan
face
his
sunken
eyes
with
their
look
of
wistful
longing
were
fixed
on
the
blazing
logs
the
silence
became
so
oppressive
that
i
had
to
break
it
george
i
said
were
you
never
hungry
before
never
in
my
life
was
short
of
grub
till
now
he
answered
shortly
at
that
hubbard
aroused
from
his
reverie
looked
up
well
i
can
tell
you
george
he
said
there
are
worse
places
than
labrador
to
starve
in
how
that
grunted
george
if
you
had
been
as
hungry
as
i
have
been
in
new
york
city
you
know
what
i
mean
said
hubbard
it
a
heap
worse
to
be
hungry
where
there
lots
of
grub
around
you
than
in
the
bush
where
there
none
i
remember
that
when
i
first
went
to
new
york
and
was
looking
for
work
i
found
myself
one
rainy
night
with
only
five
cents
in
my
pocket
it
was
all
the
money
i
had
in
the
world
and
i
had
any
friends
in
the
city
and
i
did
want
to
write
home
because
nearly
all
the
people
there
had
no
faith
in
my
venture
i
was
soaking
wet
and
good
and
hungry
i
had
been
eating
much
for
several
days
well
i
went
to
a
bakery
and
blew
in
my
last
nickel
on
stale
rolls
and
crullers
and
took
them
to
my
room
then
i
took
off
my
wet
clothes
and
got
into
bed
to
get
warm
and
snug
and
there
i
ate
my
rolls
and
crullers
and
they
were
bully
yes
i
remember
that
although
my
room
rent
was
overdue
and
i
did
know
where
my
breakfast
was
coming
from
i
was
supremely
happy
i
sort
of
felt
i
was
doing
the
best
i
could
we
went
to
bed
that
night
feeling
that
our
lives
now
depended
on
whether
fish
could
be
caught
below
more
than
anxious
were
we
for
the
morrow
because
then
we
should
go
to
the
first
rapid
on
the
beaver
river
below
the
lakes
and
there
in
the
pool
where
two
fishings
had
yielded
us
more
than
one
hundred
and
thirty
trout
on
the
up
trail
test
our
fortunes
the
morning
october
dawned
crisp
and
wintry
the
sun
rose
in
a
cloudless
sky
and
set
all
the
lake
on
the
peaks
of
the
kipling
mountains
the
sunbeams
kissed
the
snow
causing
it
to
gleam
and
scintillate
in
brilliant
contrast
to
the
deep
blue
of
the
heavens
above
and
the
dark
green
of
the
forests
below
under
normal
circumstances
we
should
have
paused
to
drink
in
the
beauty
of
it
all
but
as
we
in
our
faithful
old
canoe
paddled
quickly
down
over
the
lake
i
am
afraid
that
none
of
us
thought
of
anything
save
the
outcome
of
the
test
we
were
to
make
of
our
fortunes
at
the
rapid
for
which
we
were
bound
it
is
difficult
to
be
receptive
to
beauty
when
one
has
had
only
a
little
watered
pea
meal
for
breakfast
after
a
long
train
of
lean
and
hungry
days
we
were
glad
only
that
the
sun
was
modifying
the
chill
air
of
the
dawn
thus
increasing
our
chance
of
getting
fish
how
friendly
the
narrow
lake
looked
where
we
had
seen
the
otter
at
play
at
sunset
and
where
the
loons
had
laughed
at
us
so
derisively
and
the
point
where
we
had
camped
that
august
night
and
roasted
our
goose
seemed
very
homelike
we
stopped
there
for
a
moment
to
look
for
bones
there
were
a
few
charred
ones
where
the
fire
had
been
they
crumbled
without
much
pressure
and
we
ate
them
no
trout
were
jumping
in
the
lake
now
its
surface
was
unbroken
all
was
still
very
still
to
our
somewhat
feverish
imagination
it
seemed
as
if
all
nature
were
bating
its
breath
as
if
tensely
waiting
for
the
outcome
at
the
fishing
pool
i
can
hardly
say
what
we
expected
i
fear
my
own
faith
was
weak
but
i
believe
hubbard
was
strong
his
was
the
optimistic
temperament
how
glad
we
were
to
feel
the
river
current
as
it
caught
the
canoe
and
hurried
it
on
to
the
rapid
suddenly
as
we
turned
a
point
in
the
stream
the
sound
of
the
rushing
waters
came
to
us
a
few
moments
more
and
we
were
there
just
above
the
rapid
we
ran
the
canoe
ashore
and
hubbard
with
his
rod
hurried
down
to
the
pool
and
cast
a
fly
upon
the
water
xv
george
dream
since
the
weather
had
become
colder
we
always
fished
with
bait
if
any
were
available
and
so
when
after
a
few
minutes
a
small
trout
took
hubbard
fly
he
made
his
next
cast
with
a
fin
cut
from
his
first
catch
before
he
cast
the
fly
george
and
i
ran
the
canoe
through
the
rapid
to
a
point
just
below
the
pool
where
we
had
decided
to
camp
then
leaving
george
to
finish
the
work
of
making
camp
i
took
my
rod
and
joined
hubbard
all
day
long
and
until
after
dusk
we
fished
we
got
sixty
but
they
were
all
tiny
not
averaging
more
than
six
inches
long
the
test
of
our
fortunes
was
not
encouraging
hubbard
especially
was
disappointed
as
he
had
been
cherishing
the
hope
that
we
might
catch
enough
to
carry
us
well
down
the
trail
and
what
were
sixty
little
fish
divided
among
three
ravenous
men
we
ate
fifteen
of
them
for
luncheon
and
eighteen
for
supper
and
began
to
fear
the
worst
the
pea
meal
now
was
down
to
one
and
a
half
pounds
it
was
late
when
we
gave
up
trying
to
get
more
fish
but
we
sat
long
by
the
fire
considering
the
possibility
of
finding
scraps
at
the
camp
down
the
beaver
where
we
had
killed
the
caribou
on
august
the
head
we
remembered
had
been
left
practically
untouched
and
besides
the
bones
there
were
three
hoofs
lying
about
somewhere
if
they
had
not
been
carried
off
by
animals
we
knew
that
these
scraps
had
been
rotting
for
two
months
but
we
looked
forward
hopefully
to
reaching
them
on
the
morrow
no
lovelier
morning
ever
dawned
than
that
of
saturday
october
and
until
midday
the
weather
was
balmy
and
warm
but
in
the
afternoon
clouds
began
to
gather
attended
by
a
raw
west
wind
while
george
and
i
shot
the
rapids
hubbard
fished
them
catching
in
all
seventeen
little
trout
some
of
the
rapids
george
and
i
went
through
in
the
canoe
we
should
never
under
ordinary
conditions
have
dreamed
of
shooting
but
george
expressed
the
sentiments
of
all
of
us
when
he
said
we
may
as
well
drown
as
starve
and
it
a
blamed
sight
quicker
only
when
the
river
made
actual
falls
did
george
and
i
resort
to
portaging
however
we
did
not
make
the
progress
we
had
hoped
and
much
disappointed
that
we
could
not
reach
camp
caribou
that
night
we
camped
at
the
foot
of
the
last
fall
above
the
lake
expansion
on
the
shore
of
which
george
and
i
had
ascended
a
hill
to
be
rewarded
with
a
splendid
view
of
the
country
and
the
kipling
mountains
our
day
food
consisted
of
three
trout
each
at
each
of
our
three
meals
sunday
october
was
another
perfect
day
it
was
wintry
but
we
had
become
inured
to
the
cold
we
each
had
a
pair
of
skin
mittens
which
although
practically
gone
as
to
the
palms
served
to
protect
our
hands
from
the
winds
before
we
started
forward
i
read
aloud
john
xvii
again
in
the
morning
we
divided
nine
little
trout
among
us
and
the
remaining
eight
we
had
for
luncheon
the
weather
was
now
so
cold
that
do
what
we
would
we
never
again
could
induce
a
trout
large
or
small
to
take
the
bait
or
rise
to
the
fly
in
the
course
of
the
day
george
took
two
long
shots
at
ducks
and
missed
both
times
it
would
have
been
phenomenal
if
he
had
there
was
one
fall
that
we
could
not
shoot
and
we
landed
on
the
bank
to
unload
the
canoe
all
three
of
us
tried
to
lift
the
canoe
so
as
to
carry
it
about
thirty
yards
down
to
where
we
could
again
launch
it
but
we
were
unable
to
get
it
to
our
heads
and
it
fell
to
ground
with
a
crash
then
we
looked
at
one
another
and
understood
no
one
spoke
but
we
all
understood
up
to
this
time
hubbard
and
i
had
kept
up
the
fiction
that
we
were
not
so
weak
but
now
all
of
us
knew
that
concealment
no
longer
was
possible
and
the
clear
perception
came
to
us
that
if
we
ever
got
out
of
the
wilderness
it
would
be
only
by
the
grace
of
god
with
difficulty
we
dragged
the
canoe
to
the
launching
place
and
on
the
way
found
the
cleaning
rod
hubbard
father
had
made
for
him
which
had
been
lost
while
we
were
portaging
around
the
fall
on
our
upward
journey
hubbard
picked
the
rod
up
tenderly
and
put
it
in
the
canoe
an
hour
before
sunset
we
reached
camp
caribou
the
place
where
we
had
broiled
those
luscious
steaks
that
of
august
and
had
merrily
talked
and
feasted
far
into
the
night
having
dragged
the
canoe
up
on
the
sandy
shore
we
did
not
wait
to
unload
it
but
at
once
staggered
up
the
bank
to
begin
our
eager
search
for
scraps
the
head
of
the
caribou
dried
and
was
where
we
had
left
it
the
bones
we
had
cut
the
meat
from
were
there
the
remnants
of
the
stomach
partially
washed
away
were
there
but
we
found
only
two
hoofs
we
had
left
three
up
and
down
and
all
around
the
camp
we
searched
for
that
other
hoof
but
it
was
gone
somebody
taken
it
said
george
somebody
taken
it
sure
a
marten
or
somebody
when
all
the
refuse
we
could
find
had
been
collected
and
the
tent
had
been
pitched
on
the
spot
where
it
stood
before
george
got
a
fire
going
and
prepared
our
banquet
of
bones
and
hoofs
the
bit
of
hair
that
clung
to
the
skin
on
the
upper
part
of
the
hoofs
he
singed
off
by
holding
them
a
moment
in
the
fire
then
taking
an
axe
he
chopped
the
hoofs
and
bones
up
together
and
placed
some
of
the
mess
in
the
kettle
to
boil
a
really
greasy
though
very
rancid
broth
resulted
some
of
the
bones
and
particularly
the
hoofs
were
maggoty
but
as
hubbard
said
the
maggots
seemed
to
make
the
broth
the
richer
and
we
drank
it
all
it
tasted
good
for
some
time
we
sat
gnawing
the
gristle
and
scraps
of
decayed
flesh
that
clung
to
the
bones
and
we
were
honestly
thankful
for
our
meal
the
bones
from
which
we
made
our
broth
were
not
thrown
away
on
the
contrary
we
carefully
took
them
from
the
kettle
and
placed
them
with
the
other
bones
to
boil
and
reboil
them
until
the
last
particle
of
grease
had
been
extracted
there
was
little
left
on
the
head
save
the
hide
but
that
also
was
placed
with
the
pile
of
bones
as
well
as
the
antlers
which
were
in
velvet
and
what
remained
of
the
stomach
and
its
contents
after
we
had
finished
gnawing
our
bones
george
sat
very
quiet
as
if
brooding
over
some
great
problem
finally
he
arose
brought
his
camp
bag
to
the
fire
and
resuming
his
seat
went
low
into
the
recesses
of
the
bag
still
holding
his
hand
in
the
bag
he
looked
at
me
and
grinned
well
said
i
he
replied
and
slowly
withdrawing
his
hand
held
up
an
ounce
package
of
cut
plug
tobacco
i
stared
at
the
tobacco
and
then
again
caught
george
eye
our
smiles
became
beatific
i
been
savin
this
for
when
we
needed
it
most
said
george
and
i
guess
the
time
come
he
handed
me
the
package
and
i
filled
my
pipe
long
unused
to
anything
save
leaves
from
the
teapot
and
red
willow
bark
then
george
filled
his
pipe
from
the
fire
we
took
brands
and
applied
them
to
the
tobacco
deep
deep
were
our
inhalations
of
the
fragrant
smoke
george
said
i
however
in
the
world
could
you
keep
it
so
long
well
said
george
puff
puff
well
when
we
were
gettin
so
short
of
grub
puff
thinks
i
puff
the
time
comin
puff
puff
when
we
need
cheerin
up
puff
and
says
i
puff
just
sneak
this
away
until
that
time
comes
george
said
i
lying
back
and
watching
the
smoke
curl
upward
in
the
light
of
the
fire
you
are
not
a
half
bad
sort
of
a
fellow
wallace
said
be
we
have
a
pipeful
of
this
every
night
until
it
is
gone
i
try
it
too
said
hubbard
wistfully
but
i
know
it
would
make
me
sick
so
i
drink
a
little
tea
after
he
had
had
his
tea
he
read
to
us
the
first
psalm
these
readings
from
the
bible
brought
with
them
a
feeling
of
indescribable
comfort
and
i
fancy
we
all
went
to
our
blankets
that
night
content
to
know
that
whatever
was
was
for
the
best
with
the
first
signs
of
dawn
we
were
up
and
had
another
pot
of
bone
broth
again
the
morning
october
was
crisp
and
beautiful
and
the
continuance
of
the
good
weather
gave
us
new
courage
while
the
others
broke
camp
i
went
on
down
the
river
bank
in
the
hope
of
finding
game
but
when
after
i
had
walked
a
mile
they
overtook
me
with
the
canoe
i
had
seen
nothing
while
boiling
bones
at
noon
we
industriously
employed
ourselves
in
removing
the
velvet
skin
from
the
antlers
and
singeing
the
hair
off
in
the
afternoon
we
encountered
more
rapids
once
hubbard
relieved
me
at
the
stern
paddle
but
he
was
too
weak
to
act
quickly
and
we
had
a
narrow
escape
from
being
overturned
while
making
camp
at
night
george
heard
a
whiskey
jack
calling
and
he
sneaked
off
into
the
brush
and
shot
it
we
reserved
it
as
a
dainty
for
breakfast
as
we
sat
by
the
fire
gnawing
bones
and
chewing
up
scorched
pieces
of
antlers
we
again
discussed
the
question
as
to
whether
we
should
stick
to
the
canoe
and
run
the
river
out
to
its
mouth
or
abandon
the
canoe
where
we
had
entered
the
river
as
usual
george
and
i
urged
the
former
course
when
you
in
the
bush
stick
to
your
canoe
as
long
as
you
can
said
george
that
always
a
good
plan
but
hubbard
was
firm
in
the
belief
that
we
should
take
the
route
we
knew
and
renewed
his
argument
about
the
possibility
of
getting
windbound
on
goose
bay
into
which
we
thought
the
river
flowed
being
windbound
had
for
him
especial
terrors
due
i
suppose
to
his
normally
active
nature
another
thing
that
inclined
him
towards
taking
the
old
trail
was
his
strong
faith
that
we
should
get
trout
in
the
outlet
to
lake
elson
where
we
had
such
a
successful
fishing
on
the
inbound
journey
he
argued
furthermore
that
along
what
we
then
thought
was
the
nascaupee
river
we
should
be
able
to
recover
the
provisions
we
had
abandoned
soon
after
plunging
into
the
wild
however
he
said
in
closing
we
see
how
we
feel
about
it
i
sleep
on
it
i
remember
i
dreaded
so
much
a
return
to
the
susan
valley
that
i
told
hubbard
it
seemed
like
suicide
to
leave
the
river
we
were
on
and
abandon
the
canoe
i
felt
strongly
on
the
subject
and
expressed
my
opinion
freely
but
it
was
a
question
of
judgment
about
which
one
man
opinion
was
as
likely
to
be
right
as
another
and
recognising
this
we
never
permitted
our
discussions
as
to
the
best
course
to
follow
to
create
any
on
tuesday
october
the
weather
continued
to
favour
us
we
shot
the
rapids
without
a
mishap
and
camped
at
night
within
three
miles
of
where
we
had
entered
the
river
but
still
the
question
about
leaving
it
was
undecided
the
whiskey
jack
and
a
bit
of
pea
meal
helped
our
pot
of
bone
broth
at
breakfast
and
in
addition
to
more
broth
we
had
in
the
evening
some
of
the
caribou
stomach
and
its
contents
and
a
part
of
a
moccasin
that
hubbard
had
made
from
the
caribou
skin
and
had
worn
full
of
holes
boiled
in
the
kettle
the
skin
swelled
thick
and
was
fairly
palatable
clouds
and
a
sprinkle
of
rain
introduced
the
morning
of
wednesday
october
while
the
bones
were
boiling
for
breakfast
george
brought
out
the
caribou
skin
that
he
had
picked
up
on
the
shore
of
lake
disappointment
after
we
had
abandoned
it
now
as
he
put
a
piece
of
it
in
the
kettle
we
recalled
his
prophecy
that
some
day
we
might
want
to
eat
it
and
laughed
into
the
pot
also
went
of
a
pound
of
pea
meal
together
with
a
few
lumps
of
flour
that
we
carefully
scraped
from
a
bag
we
had
thrown
away
in
the
summer
and
found
near
the
camp
while
we
were
eating
this
breakfast
and
really
enjoying
it
we
again
considered
the
problem
as
to
whether
or
not
we
should
leave
the
river
in
the
course
of
the
discussion
george
said
quietly
i
had
a
strange
dream
about
that
last
night
fellus
we
urged
him
to
tell
us
what
it
was
it
was
a
strange
dream
he
repeated
and
hesitated
then
well
i
dreamed
the
lord
stood
before
me
very
beautiful
and
bright
and
he
had
a
mighty
kind
look
on
his
face
and
he
said
to
me
do
leave
this
river
just
stick
to
it
and
it
will
take
you
out
to
grand
lake
where
you
find
blake
cache
with
lots
of
grub
and
then
you
be
all
right
and
safe
i
ca
spare
you
any
more
fish
george
and
if
you
leave
this
river
you
wo
get
any
more
just
stick
to
this
river
and
i
take
you
out
safe
the
lord
was
all
smilin
and
bright
continued
george
and
he
looked
at
me
very
pleasant
then
he
went
away
and
i
dreamed
we
went
right
down
the
river
and
came
out
in
grand
lake
near
where
we
had
left
it
comin
up
and
we
found
blake
there
and
he
fed
us
and
gave
us
all
the
grub
we
wanted
and
we
had
a
fine
time
it
was
quite
evident
that
george
was
greatly
impressed
by
his
dream
i
give
it
here
simply
for
what
it
is
worth
at
the
same
time
i
can
not
help
characterising
it
as
remarkable
not
to
say
extraordinary
for
none
of
us
had
had
even
a
suspicion
that
the
river
we
were
on
emptied
into
grand
lake
at
all
much
less
that
its
mouth
was
near
the
point
where
we
left
the
lake
but
i
myself
attached
no
importance
to
the
dream
at
the
time
whatever
i
may
think
now
i
was
chiefly
influenced
i
suppose
in
my
opposition
to
the
abandonment
of
the
river
by
the
unspeakable
dread
i
had
felt
all
along
of
returning
to
the
susan
valley
was
it
a
premonition
and
no
doubt
it
was
only
natural
that
hubbard
should
disregard
the
dream
it
surely
was
an
unusual
dream
he
said
to
george
but
it
possible
as
you
know
for
this
river
to
empty
into
grand
lake
we
were
talking
about
leaving
the
river
until
late
last
night
and
you
had
it
on
your
mind
that
what
made
you
dream
about
it
may
be
it
was
said
george
calmly
but
it
was
a
mighty
strange
dream
and
we
better
think
about
it
before
we
leave
the
river
stick
to
the
canoe
hubbard
that
what
i
say
wallace
and
i
shoot
the
rapids
all
right
they
sure
to
be
not
so
bad
as
we
had
and
i
think
they
be
a
lot
better
we
can
run
ca
we
wallace
i
added
my
opinion
to
george
that
there
would
be
more
water
to
cover
the
rocks
farther
down
and
said
that
however
bad
the
rapids
might
be
i
should
venture
to
take
the
stern
paddle
in
every
one
that
george
dared
to
tackle
but
hubbard
only
said
i
still
think
boys
we
should
take
the
trail
we
know
that
means
suicide
i
said
for
the
second
time
rather
bitterly
i
fear
we
surely
leave
our
bones
in
that
awful
valley
over
there
we
too
weak
to
accomplish
that
march
once
more
hubbard
marshalled
his
arguments
in
favour
of
the
overland
route
and
george
and
i
said
no
more
that
morning
soon
after
we
relaunched
the
canoe
something
occurred
to
change
the
current
of
our
thoughts
a
little
way
ahead
of
us
swimming
slowly
down
the
river
george
espied
a
duck
no
one
spoke
while
we
landed
him
rifle
in
hand
on
the
bank
cautiously
he
stole
down
among
the
alders
and
willows
that
lined
the
shore
and
then
crawled
on
hands
and
knees
through
the
marsh
until
the
duck
was
opposite
to
him
it
seemed
a
very
small
thing
for
a
rifle
target
while
it
was
moving
and
as
george
put
the
rifle
to
his
shoulder
and
carefully
aimed
hubbard
and
i
watched
him
with
nerves
drawn
to
a
tension
once
he
lowered
the
rifle
changed
his
position
slightly
then
again
raised
the
weapon
to
his
shoulder
he
was
deliberation
personified
would
he
never
fire
but
suddenly
the
stillness
of
the
wilderness
was
broken
by
a
loud
clear
report
and
hubbard
and
i
breathed
again
breathed
a
prayer
of
gratitude
as
we
saw
the
duck
turn
over
on
its
back
with
his
long
black
hair
falling
loosely
over
his
ears
ragged
and
dripping
wet
with
the
marsh
water
george
arose
and
returned
to
us
stopping
for
a
moment
before
entering
the
canoe
he
looked
heavenward
and
reverently
said
the
lord
surely
guided
that
bullet
it
was
still
early
in
the
morning
when
we
arrived
at
the
point
where
we
had
portaged
into
the
river
george
prepared
the
duck
small
it
was
but
very
fat
for
a
delicious
glorious
luncheon
and
while
it
was
cooking
we
had
our
last
discussion
as
to
whether
or
not
we
should
leave
the
river
well
i
at
length
said
to
hubbard
a
final
decision
can
be
deferred
no
longer
it
up
to
you
which
route
are
we
to
take
i
firmly
believe
said
hubbard
that
we
should
stick
to
our
old
trail
george
and
i
said
no
more
the
question
was
settled
hubbard
was
the
leader
immediately
after
luncheon
we
set
to
work
preparing
for
the
march
overland
in
addition
to
several
minor
articles
of
equipment
we
decided
to
leave
behind
us
the
artificial
horizon
the
sextant
box
and
one
of
the
axes
when
our
light
packs
had
been
prepared
we
turned
the
canoe
bottom
up
on
the
river
bank
i
hated
to
leave
it
i
turned
once
to
pat
and
stroke
the
little
craft
that
had
carried
us
so
far
in
safety
to
me
it
was
one
of
our
party
a
dear
friend
and
comrade
it
seemed
cruel
to
abandon
it
there
in
the
midst
of
the
wilderness
in
my
abnormal
state
of
mind
i
could
scarcely
restrain
the
tears
but
the
best
of
friends
must
part
and
so
shouldering
our
light
packs
we
bid
the
canoe
a
last
farewell
and
staggered
forward
to
the
horrors
in
store
for
us
on
the
trail
below
xvi
at
the
last
camp
we
began
our
march
back
to
the
susan
valley
with
a
definite
plan
some
miles
below
on
the
susan
river
we
had
abandoned
about
four
pounds
of
wet
flour
twelve
or
fifteen
miles
below
the
flour
there
was
a
pound
of
powdered
milk
and
four
or
five
miles
still
further
down
the
trail
a
pail
with
perhaps
four
pounds
of
lard
hubbard
considered
the
distances
and
mapped
out
each
day
march
as
he
hoped
to
accomplish
it
we
had
in
our
possession
besides
the
caribou
bones
and
hide
one
and
pounds
of
pea
meal
could
we
reach
the
flour
if
so
that
perhaps
would
take
us
on
to
the
milk
powder
and
that
to
the
lard
and
then
we
should
be
within
easy
distance
of
grand
lake
and
winter
hunting
cache
hubbard
was
hopeful
george
and
i
were
fearful
hubbard
belief
that
we
should
be
able
to
reach
the
flour
was
largely
based
on
his
expectation
that
we
should
get
fish
in
the
outlet
to
lake
elson
his
idea
was
that
the
water
of
the
lake
would
be
much
warmer
than
that
of
the
river
he
had
poor
chap
the
fatal
faculty
common
to
persons
of
the
optimistic
temperament
of
making
himself
believe
what
he
wanted
to
believe
neither
george
nor
i
remarked
on
the
possibilities
or
probabilities
of
our
getting
fish
in
lake
elson
outlet
and
just
before
we
said
to
the
canoe
hubbard
turned
to
me
and
said
wallace
do
you
think
we
get
them
there
are
you
hopeful
we
shall
yes
i
hope
i
answered
but
i
fear
the
fish
you
know
have
been
rising
at
all
for
several
days
and
perhaps
it
better
not
to
let
our
hopes
run
too
high
for
then
if
they
fail
us
the
disappointment
wo
be
so
hard
to
bear
yes
that
so
he
replied
but
it
makes
me
feel
good
to
look
forward
to
good
fishing
there
we
will
get
fish
there
we
will
just
say
we
will
for
that
makes
me
feel
happy
we
will
we
say
we
will
i
repeated
to
comfort
him
under
ordinary
conditions
we
should
have
found
our
packs
in
their
depleted
state
very
easy
to
carry
but
as
it
was
they
weighed
us
down
grievously
as
we
trudged
laboriously
up
the
hill
from
the
river
and
over
the
ridge
to
the
marsh
on
the
farther
side
of
which
lay
lake
elson
on
the
top
of
the
ridge
and
on
the
slope
where
it
descended
to
the
marsh
we
found
a
few
mossberries
which
we
ate
while
we
rested
crossing
the
marsh
we
stepped
from
bog
to
bog
when
we
could
but
a
large
part
of
the
time
were
in
the
icy
water
and
mud
our
feet
at
this
time
were
wrapped
in
pieces
of
a
camp
blanket
tied
to
what
remained
of
the
moccasin
uppers
with
pieces
of
our
old
trolling
line
george
and
i
were
all
but
spent
when
we
reached
our
old
camping
ground
on
the
outlet
to
lake
elson
and
what
it
cost
hubbard
to
get
across
that
marsh
i
can
only
imagine
as
soon
as
we
arrived
hubbard
tried
the
fish
it
did
not
take
him
long
to
become
convinced
that
there
was
no
hope
of
inducing
any
to
rise
it
was
a
severe
blow
to
him
but
he
rallied
his
courage
and
soon
apparently
was
as
full
of
confidence
as
ever
that
we
should
be
able
to
reach
the
flour
while
hubbard
was
trying
the
fish
george
looked
the
old
camp
over
carefully
for
refuse
and
found
two
goose
heads
some
goose
bones
and
the
lard
pail
we
had
emptied
there
i
heat
the
pail
he
said
and
maybe
there
be
a
little
grease
sticking
to
it
that
we
can
stir
in
our
broth
then
after
looking
at
us
for
a
moment
he
put
his
hand
into
the
pail
and
added
i
got
a
little
surprise
here
i
thought
i
keep
it
until
the
bones
were
boiled
but
i
guess
you
might
as
well
have
it
now
from
out
of
the
pail
he
brought
three
little
pieces
of
bacon
just
a
mouthful
for
each
i
can
not
remember
what
we
said
but
as
i
write
i
can
almost
feel
again
the
thrill
of
joy
that
came
to
me
upon
beholding
those
little
pieces
of
bacon
they
seemed
like
a
bit
of
food
from
home
and
they
were
to
us
as
the
rarest
dainty
george
reboiled
the
bones
with
a
piece
of
the
hide
and
the
remainder
of
the
deer
stomach
and
with
this
and
the
goose
bones
and
heads
we
finished
our
supper
we
were
fairly
comfortable
when
we
went
to
rest
the
hunger
pangs
were
passing
now
i
have
said
that
at
this
time
i
was
in
an
abnormal
state
of
mind
i
suppose
that
was
true
of
us
all
the
love
of
life
had
ceased
to
be
strong
upon
us
for
myself
i
know
that
i
was
conscious
only
of
a
feeling
that
i
must
do
all
i
could
to
preserve
my
life
and
to
help
the
others
probably
it
was
the
beginning
of
the
feeling
of
indifference
or
reconciliation
with
the
inevitable
that
mercifully
comes
at
the
approach
of
death
in
the
morning
thursday
october
we
again
went
over
our
belongings
and
decided
to
abandon
numerous
articles
we
had
hitherto
hoped
to
carry
through
with
us
my
rifle
and
cartridges
some
pistol
ammunition
the
sextant
the
tarpaulin
fifteen
rolls
of
photograph
films
my
fishing
rod
maps
and
note
book
and
various
other
odds
and
ends
including
the
cleaning
rod
hubbard
father
had
made
for
him
i
wonder
where
father
and
mother
are
now
said
hubbard
as
he
took
a
last
look
at
the
cleaning
rod
for
a
few
moments
he
clung
to
it
lovingly
then
handed
it
to
me
with
the
words
put
it
with
your
rifle
and
fishing
rod
and
as
i
removed
the
cartridge
from
the
magazine
and
held
the
rifle
up
for
a
last
look
before
wrapping
it
in
the
tarpaulin
he
said
it
almost
makes
me
cry
to
see
you
leave
the
fishing
rod
if
it
is
at
all
possible
we
must
see
that
the
things
are
recovered
if
they
are
i
want
you
to
promise
me
that
when
you
die
you
will
the
rod
to
me
it
has
got
us
more
grub
than
anything
else
in
the
outfit
and
it
carried
us
over
some
bad
times
i
like
to
have
it
and
i
keep
and
cherish
it
always
i
promised
him
that
he
certainly
should
have
it
well
the
rod
was
recovered
and
now
when
i
look
at
the
old
piece
of
wood
as
it
reposes
comfortably
in
my
den
at
home
i
recall
this
incident
and
my
imagination
carries
me
back
to
those
last
fishing
days
when
hubbard
used
it
and
i
can
see
again
his
gaunt
form
arrayed
in
rags
as
he
anxiously
whipped
the
waters
on
our
terrible
struggle
homeward
it
is
the
only
thing
i
have
with
which
he
was
closely
associated
during
those
awful
days
and
it
is
my
most
precious
possession
as
we
were
chewing
on
a
piece
of
hide
and
drinking
the
water
from
the
reboiled
bones
at
breakfast
hubbard
told
us
he
had
had
a
realistic
dream
of
rejoining
his
wife
the
boy
was
again
piteously
homesick
and
when
we
shouldered
with
difficulty
our
lightened
packs
and
began
the
weary
struggle
on
my
heart
was
heavy
with
a
great
dread
dark
clouds
hung
low
in
the
sky
but
the
day
was
mild
once
or
twice
while
skirting
lake
elson
we
halted
to
pick
the
few
scattering
mossberries
that
were
to
be
found
once
we
halted
to
make
tea
to
stimulate
us
and
at
our
old
camp
on
mountaineer
lake
we
again
boiled
the
bones
and
used
the
water
to
wash
down
another
piece
of
the
caribou
hide
in
the
afternoon
george
took
the
lead
i
followed
and
hubbard
brought
up
the
rear
suddenly
george
stopped
dropped
his
pack
and
drew
hubbard
pistol
which
he
carried
because
he
was
heading
the
procession
hubbard
and
i
also
halted
and
dropped
our
packs
into
the
brush
george
disappeared
and
we
heard
at
short
intervals
the
pistol
crack
three
times
then
george
reappeared
with
three
how
our
hearts
bounded
how
we
took
george
hand
and
pressed
it
while
his
face
lighted
up
with
the
old
familiar
grin
we
fingered
the
birds
to
make
sure
they
were
good
and
fat
we
turned
them
over
and
over
and
gloated
over
them
george
plucked
them
at
once
that
we
might
see
their
plump
bodies
it
is
true
we
were
not
so
very
hungry
but
those
birds
meant
that
we
could
travel
just
so
much
the
farther
we
pushed
on
that
we
might
make
our
night
camp
at
the
place
where
we
had
held
the
goose
banquet
on
the
of
august
that
glorious
night
when
we
were
so
eager
to
proceed
when
the
northern
lights
illuminated
the
heavens
and
the
lichens
gleamed
on
the
barren
hill
hubbard
i
noticed
was
lagging
and
i
told
george
quietly
to
set
a
slower
pace
then
to
give
hubbard
encouragement
i
fell
to
the
rear
the
boy
was
staggering
fearfully
and
i
watched
him
with
increasing
consternation
we
must
get
him
out
of
here
we
must
we
must
i
kept
saying
to
myself
the
camping
place
was
only
two
hundred
yards
away
when
he
sank
on
the
trail
i
was
at
his
side
in
a
moment
he
looked
up
at
me
with
a
pitiful
smile
and
spoke
so
low
i
could
scarcely
hear
him
i
got
to
rest
here
a
little
just
a
little
while
you
understand
my
legs
have
given
out
that
right
take
a
little
rest
i
said
you
be
all
right
soon
but
rest
a
little
i
rest
a
bit
with
you
and
then
leave
your
pack
here
and
you
walk
to
camp
light
and
i
come
back
for
your
pack
in
a
few
minutes
he
got
bravely
up
we
left
his
pack
and
together
walked
slowly
on
to
join
george
at
the
old
goose
camp
on
goose
creek
then
i
returned
for
the
pack
that
had
been
left
behind
george
boiled
one
of
the
grouse
for
supper
hubbard
told
us
he
was
not
discouraged
his
weakness
he
said
was
only
momentary
and
he
was
sure
he
would
be
quite
himself
in
the
morning
ready
to
continue
the
march
homeward
after
supper
as
he
was
lying
before
the
fire
he
asked
me
if
i
was
not
too
tired
to
read
him
the
latter
part
of
the
sixth
chapter
of
matthew
i
took
the
book
and
read
as
he
requested
closing
with
the
words
wherefore
if
god
so
clothe
the
grass
of
the
field
which
is
and
is
cast
into
the
oven
shall
he
not
much
more
clothe
you
o
ye
of
little
faith
therefore
take
no
thought
saying
what
shall
we
eat
or
what
shall
we
drink
or
wherewithal
shall
we
be
clothed
for
after
all
these
things
do
the
gentiles
seek
for
your
heavenly
father
knoweth
that
ye
have
need
of
all
these
things
but
seek
ye
first
the
kingdom
of
god
and
his
righteousness
and
all
these
things
shall
be
added
unto
you
take
therefore
no
thought
for
the
morrow
for
the
morrow
shall
take
thought
for
the
things
of
itself
sufficient
unto
the
day
is
the
evil
thereof
how
beautiful
how
encouraging
that
is
said
hubbard
as
i
put
away
the
book
he
crawled
into
the
tent
to
go
to
sleep
then
i
so
happy
so
very
very
happy
for
we
going
home
going
home
and
he
slept
before
i
lay
down
i
wrote
in
my
diary
hubbard
is
in
very
bad
shape
completely
worn
out
physically
and
mentally
but
withal
a
great
hero
never
complaining
and
always
trying
to
cheer
us
up
george
said
he
was
sick
when
he
went
to
rest
and
that
added
to
my
concern
friday
morning
october
came
clear
mild
and
beautiful
i
was
up
at
break
of
day
to
start
the
fire
and
soon
was
followed
by
george
and
a
little
later
by
hubbard
we
all
said
we
were
feeling
better
george
shot
a
foolhardy
whiskey
jack
that
ventured
too
near
the
camp
and
it
went
into
the
pot
with
a
grouse
for
breakfast
the
meal
eaten
we
all
felt
very
much
stronger
but
decided
that
more
outfit
must
be
abandoned
i
gave
george
my
extra
undershirt
and
a
blue
flannel
shirt
both
of
which
he
donned
every
scrap
we
thought
at
the
time
we
could
do
without
including
many
photograph
films
and
george
blanket
was
cached
after
hubbard
read
aloud
john
xv
we
resumed
the
struggle
naturally
george
and
i
relieved
hubbard
of
everything
he
would
permit
us
to
the
fact
was
we
could
not
have
taken
much
more
and
moved
when
hubbard
broke
down
on
the
trail
it
was
strictly
necessary
for
me
to
make
two
trips
with
the
packs
although
his
weighed
something
less
than
ten
pounds
i
could
not
have
carried
it
in
addition
to
my
own
if
my
life
had
depended
upon
it
just
below
the
place
where
hubbard
caught
so
many
fish
that
day
in
august
that
we
killed
the
geese
we
stopped
for
a
moment
to
rest
hardly
had
we
halted
when
george
grabbed
hubbard
rifle
exclaiming
deer
about
four
hundred
yards
below
us
a
magnificent
caribou
his
head
held
high
dashed
across
the
stream
and
into
the
bush
he
was
on
our
lee
and
had
winded
us
no
shot
was
fired
one
fleeting
glance
and
he
was
gone
our
feelings
can
be
imagined
his
capture
would
have
secured
our
safety
we
struggled
on
at
midday
we
ate
our
last
grouse
at
this
stopping
place
george
abandoned
his
waterproof
camp
bag
and
his
personal
effects
that
he
might
be
able
to
carry
hubbard
rifle
this
relieved
hubbard
of
seven
pounds
but
he
again
failed
before
we
reached
our
night
camp
it
was
like
the
previous
evening
with
jaws
set
he
tottered
grimly
on
until
his
legs
refused
to
carry
him
farther
and
he
sank
to
the
ground
again
i
helped
him
into
camp
and
returned
for
his
pack
we
pitched
the
tent
facing
a
big
rock
so
that
the
heat
from
the
fire
blazing
between
might
be
reflected
into
the
tent
the
front
of
which
was
thrown
wide
open
of
course
george
and
i
did
all
the
camp
work
fortunately
there
was
not
much
to
do
our
camps
being
pitched
on
the
sites
of
previous
ones
we
had
stakes
ready
to
hand
for
the
tent
and
in
this
part
of
the
country
we
were
able
to
find
branches
and
logs
that
we
could
burn
without
cutting
we
still
had
one
axe
with
us
but
neither
george
nor
i
had
the
strength
to
swing
it
the
night
was
cold
and
damp
for
supper
we
had
another
piece
of
the
caribou
hide
and
water
from
the
bones
with
what
i
believed
was
the
last
of
the
pea
meal
about
two
spoonfuls
that
hubbard
shook
into
the
pot
from
the
package
which
he
then
threw
away
as
we
reclined
in
the
open
front
of
the
tent
before
the
fire
i
again
read
from
the
bible
and
again
a
feeling
of
religious
exaltation
came
to
hubbard
i
so
happy
and
oh
so
sleepy
he
murmured
and
was
quiet
he
did
not
make
his
usual
entry
in
his
diary
in
my
own
diary
for
this
date
i
find
hubbard
condition
is
pitiable
but
he
bears
himself
like
the
hero
that
he
is
trying
always
to
cheer
and
encourage
us
he
is
visibly
failing
his
voice
is
very
weak
and
low
i
fear
he
will
break
down
at
every
step
o
god
what
can
we
do
how
can
we
save
him
on
saturday
october
threatening
clouds
overcast
the
sky
and
a
raw
wind
was
blowing
it
penetrated
our
rags
and
set
us
at
dawn
we
had
more
water
from
the
bones
and
more
of
the
hide
cold
and
utterly
miserable
we
forced
our
way
along
our
progress
was
becoming
slower
and
slower
but
every
step
was
taking
us
nearer
home
we
said
and
with
that
thought
we
encouraged
ourselves
at
noon
we
came
upon
our
first
camp
above
the
susan
river
there
george
picked
up
one
of
our
old
flour
bags
a
few
lumps
of
mouldy
flour
were
clinging
to
it
and
he
scraped
them
carefully
into
the
pot
to
give
a
little
substance
to
the
bone
water
we
also
found
a
box
with
a
bit
of
baking
powder
still
in
it
the
powder
was
streaked
with
rust
from
the
tin
but
we
ate
it
all
then
hubbard
made
a
find
a
box
nearly
half
full
of
pasty
mustard
after
we
had
each
eaten
a
mouthful
george
put
the
remainder
in
the
pot
he
was
about
to
throw
the
box
away
when
hubbard
asked
that
it
be
returned
to
him
hubbard
took
the
box
and
sat
holding
it
in
his
hand
that
box
came
from
congers
he
said
as
if
in
a
reverie
it
came
from
my
home
in
congers
mina
has
had
this
very
box
in
her
hands
it
came
from
the
little
grocery
store
where
i
been
so
often
mina
handed
it
to
me
before
i
left
home
she
said
the
mustard
might
be
useful
for
plasters
we
eaten
it
instead
i
wonder
where
my
girl
is
now
i
wonder
when
i
see
her
again
yes
she
had
that
very
box
in
her
her
hands
she
been
such
a
good
wife
to
me
slowly
he
bent
his
head
and
the
tears
trickled
down
his
cheeks
george
and
i
turned
away
it
was
near
night
when
we
reached
the
point
near
the
junction
of
the
susan
river
and
goose
creek
where
we
were
to
cross
the
river
to
what
had
been
our
last
camping
ground
in
the
awful
valley
and
which
was
to
prove
our
last
camp
in
labrador
hubbard
staggered
along
during
the
afternoon
with
the
greatest
difficulty
and
finally
again
sank
to
the
ground
completely
exhausted
george
took
his
pack
across
the
river
while
he
crouched
there
on
the
trail
hubbard
face
bore
an
expression
of
absolute
despair
at
length
i
helped
him
to
his
feet
and
in
silence
we
forded
the
shallow
stream
our
camp
was
made
a
short
distance
below
the
junction
of
the
streams
among
the
fir
trees
a
little
way
from
the
river
bank
here
and
there
through
the
forest
were
numerous
large
rocks
before
one
of
these
we
pitched
the
tent
with
the
front
of
it
open
to
receive
the
heat
from
the
fire
as
it
was
reflected
from
the
rock
more
bone
water
and
hide
served
us
for
supper
with
the
addition
of
a
yeast
cake
from
a
package
george
had
carried
throughout
the
trip
and
never
used
huddling
in
the
front
of
the
tent
we
counselled
well
boys
said
hubbard
i
busted
i
ca
go
any
farther
that
plain
i
ca
go
any
farther
we
got
to
do
something
in
the
silence
the
crackling
of
the
logs
became
pronounced
george
hubbard
continued
maybe
you
had
better
try
to
reach
camp
and
send
in
help
if
you
strong
enough
to
get
there
if
you
find
a
cache
and
do
find
blake
try
to
get
back
with
some
of
the
grub
there
that
old
bag
with
a
little
flour
in
it
you
might
find
that
and
then
the
milk
powder
and
the
lard
farther
down
maybe
wallace
could
go
with
you
as
far
as
the
flour
and
bring
back
a
little
of
it
here
what
do
you
say
i
say
it
well
i
answered
we
got
to
do
something
at
once
it
the
only
thing
to
do
said
george
i
willin
and
i
do
the
best
i
can
to
find
blake
and
get
help
then
said
hubbard
you
better
start
in
the
morning
boys
if
you
do
find
the
bag
you
better
go
on
with
george
wallace
for
then
there
would
be
no
use
of
your
trying
to
get
back
here
yes
boys
you
better
start
in
the
morning
i
be
quite
comfortable
here
alone
until
help
comes
i
come
back
flour
or
no
flour
i
said
dreading
the
thought
of
his
staying
there
alone
in
the
wilderness
we
planned
it
all
before
hubbard
went
to
sleep
george
and
i
when
we
started
in
the
morning
were
to
carry
as
little
as
possible
i
thought
i
should
be
able
to
reach
the
flour
bag
and
be
back
within
three
days
we
were
to
prepare
for
hubbard
a
supply
of
wood
and
leave
him
everything
on
hand
that
might
be
called
food
the
bones
and
the
remainder
of
the
hide
a
sack
with
some
lumps
of
flour
sticking
to
it
that
i
had
recovered
at
this
camp
and
the
rest
of
the
yeast
cakes
george
and
i
were
to
depend
solely
on
the
chance
of
finding
game
i
much
relieved
now
said
hubbard
when
it
had
all
been
settled
i
feel
happy
and
contented
i
feel
that
our
troubles
are
about
ended
i
am
very
very
happy
and
contented
he
lay
down
in
his
blanket
after
a
little
he
said
i
rather
chilly
wo
you
make
the
fire
a
little
bigger
i
threw
on
more
wood
and
when
i
sat
down
i
told
him
i
should
keep
the
fire
going
all
night
for
the
air
was
damp
and
chill
oh
thank
you
he
murmured
thank
you
you
so
good
after
another
silence
the
words
came
faintly
wo
you
read
to
me
those
two
chapters
we
had
before
the
fourteenth
of
john
and
the
thirteenth
of
first
corinthians
i
like
to
hear
them
again
i
very
sleepy
but
i
want
to
hear
you
read
before
i
go
to
sleep
leaning
over
so
that
the
light
of
the
fire
might
shine
on
the
book
i
turned
to
the
fourteenth
of
john
and
began
not
your
heart
be
troubled
i
paused
to
glance
at
hubbard
he
was
asleep
like
a
weary
child
he
had
fallen
asleep
with
the
first
words
the
dancing
flames
lit
up
his
poor
haggard
brown
face
but
upon
it
now
there
was
no
look
of
suffering
it
was
radiant
with
peace
george
lay
by
his
side
also
asleep
thus
i
began
a
night
of
weary
vigil
and
foreboding
my
heart
was
heavy
with
a
presentiment
of
something
dreadful
in
the
forest
beyond
the
fire
the
darkness
was
intense
there
was
a
restless
stir
among
the
fir
tops
then
a
weary
weary
sighing
the
wind
had
arisen
i
dozed
but
what
was
that
i
sat
suddenly
erect
on
the
canvas
above
me
sounded
a
patter
patter
patter
rain
gradually
the
real
and
the
seeming
became
blended
beyond
the
on
the
edge
of
the
black
pall
of
night
horrid
shapes
began
to
gather
they
leered
at
me
and
mocked
me
and
oh
they
were
telling
me
something
dreadful
was
going
to
happen
a
sudden
jerk
and
i
sat
up
and
stared
wildly
about
me
nothing
but
the
sighing
and
the
patter
patter
patter
of
the
rain
the
fire
had
died
down
i
struggled
to
my
feet
and
threw
on
more
wood
again
the
horrid
shapes
leered
at
me
from
out
the
gloom
then
i
heard
myself
exclaiming
no
no
no
the
nameless
dread
was
strong
upon
me
i
listened
intently
for
hubbard
breathing
had
it
ceased
i
crawled
over
and
peered
long
and
anxiously
at
his
face
his
face
which
was
so
spectral
and
wan
in
the
uncertain
firelight
twice
i
did
this
a
confused
sense
of
things
evil
and
malicious
a
confused
sense
of
sighing
wind
and
pattering
rain
a
confused
sense
of
starts
and
jerks
and
struggles
with
wood
and
the
night
wore
on
the
black
slowly
faded
into
drab
the
trees
dripping
with
moisture
gradually
took
shape
the
day
of
our
parting
had
come
xvii
the
parting
it
was
a
drizzling
rain
and
the
sombre
clouds
hung
low
in
the
sky
the
wind
appeared
to
be
steadily
increasing
the
day
was
sunday
october
presently
george
sat
up
rubbed
his
eyes
and
gazed
about
him
for
a
moment
in
bewilderment
mornin
wallace
he
said
when
he
had
collected
his
senses
that
blamed
rain
will
make
the
travellin
hard
wo
it
he
tied
the
pieces
of
blanket
to
his
feet
and
started
for
the
river
to
get
a
kettle
of
water
with
which
to
reboil
the
bones
the
movement
aroused
hubbard
and
he
too
sat
up
how
the
weather
he
asked
it
makes
me
think
of
longfellow
day
i
replied
day
is
cold
and
dark
and
dreary
yes
he
quickly
returned
but
still
sad
heart
and
cease
repining
behind
the
clouds
is
the
sun
still
shining
i
looked
at
him
with
admiration
hubbard
i
exclaimed
you
a
wonder
you
a
way
of
making
our
worst
troubles
seem
light
i
been
sitting
here
imagining
all
sorts
things
there
no
call
to
worry
by
he
smilingly
said
we
soon
have
grub
now
and
then
we
can
rest
and
sleep
and
get
strong
he
arose
from
his
blanket
and
walked
out
of
the
tent
to
look
at
the
sky
slowly
he
returned
and
sank
wearily
down
i
feeling
stronger
and
better
than
i
did
last
night
he
said
but
i
too
weak
to
walk
or
stand
up
long
when
our
breakfast
of
bones
and
hide
boiled
with
a
yeast
cake
was
ready
he
sat
up
in
the
tent
to
receive
his
share
while
drinking
the
water
and
chewing
the
hide
we
again
carefully
considered
how
long
it
should
take
george
to
reach
grand
lake
and
how
long
it
would
be
before
help
could
arrive
if
he
were
able
to
obtain
any
and
how
long
it
would
require
me
to
reach
the
flour
and
return
it
was
roughly
speaking
forty
miles
to
grand
lake
and
fifteen
miles
to
the
flour
that
there
was
room
for
doubt
as
to
whether
my
strength
would
carry
me
to
the
flour
and
back
again
we
all
recognised
and
we
fully
realised
that
if
george
failed
to
reach
grand
lake
or
reaching
there
failed
to
find
blake
or
blake
cache
our
doom
would
be
sealed
but
so
long
had
death
been
staring
us
in
the
face
that
it
had
ceased
to
have
for
us
any
terror
it
was
agreed
however
that
each
man
should
do
his
best
to
live
as
long
as
possible
i
told
hubbard
i
should
do
my
utmost
to
be
back
in
three
days
even
if
i
did
not
find
the
flour
hubbard
remained
seated
in
the
front
of
the
tent
while
george
and
i
went
about
gathering
a
supply
of
wood
that
we
thought
should
last
him
until
someone
returned
george
also
brought
a
kettle
of
water
from
the
river
and
thoughtfully
placed
it
near
the
fire
for
hubbard
use
in
boiling
the
bones
and
hide
all
of
which
we
left
with
him
together
with
the
yeast
and
some
tea
i
also
turned
over
to
him
the
pair
of
blankets
he
had
delivered
to
me
at
halifax
the
birthday
gift
from
my
sisters
these
preparations
for
hubbard
comfort
completed
george
and
i
returned
to
the
tent
to
arrange
the
kits
we
were
to
take
with
us
hubbard
sat
in
the
middle
of
the
tent
towards
the
rear
george
and
i
on
either
side
of
him
in
the
front
hubbard
gave
george
his
pistol
and
compass
and
i
had
my
own
pistol
and
compass
the
pistols
we
fastened
to
our
belts
along
with
a
sheath
knife
and
tin
cup
having
a
case
for
my
compass
i
wore
it
also
on
my
belt
george
placed
his
in
his
pocket
each
of
us
had
half
a
blanket
this
to
be
our
only
covering
at
night
george
placed
his
half
together
with
a
tea
pail
and
some
tea
in
the
waterproof
bag
he
had
been
using
to
carry
food
this
bag
he
bound
with
a
pack
strap
leaving
a
loop
to
sling
over
his
shoulder
i
also
bound
my
half
a
blanket
with
a
pack
strap
thinking
as
i
did
so
that
i
soon
might
want
to
eat
the
strap
and
then
when
george
and
i
had
filled
our
waterproof
boxes
with
wax
taper
matches
and
placed
a
handful
of
pistol
cartridges
in
our
pockets
we
were
ready
to
start
at
this
point
i
suggested
it
might
be
well
for
each
man
to
make
a
note
of
such
disposition
as
he
desired
made
of
his
effects
george
made
an
entry
in
his
note
book
and
asked
hubbard
to
write
when
we
were
gone
a
letter
to
king
the
hudson
bay
company
agent
at
missanabie
in
reference
to
his
george
affairs
at
that
post
i
then
made
the
last
entry
in
my
diary
and
with
it
wrote
what
i
believed
might
be
a
last
message
to
my
sisters
and
my
friend
and
associate
in
business
alonzo
mclaughlin
i
put
the
diary
with
my
other
papers
in
my
camp
bag
and
placed
the
bag
in
the
rear
of
the
tent
where
the
note
hubbard
was
to
write
for
george
was
also
to
be
placed
we
believed
that
if
worst
came
to
worst
the
tent
was
more
likely
to
be
found
than
our
bodies
down
on
the
trail
hubbard
had
been
watching
us
silently
while
we
did
these
things
and
now
he
said
wallace
if
you
get
out
of
this
and
i
do
you
have
to
write
the
story
of
the
trip
i
expressed
some
doubt
as
to
my
ability
but
he
made
me
promise
i
would
do
the
best
i
could
i
also
promised
at
his
request
that
if
i
survived
him
i
should
place
his
diary
in
his
wife
hands
thank
you
he
said
and
now
before
you
leave
me
wo
you
read
to
me
again
i
want
to
hear
that
fourteenth
chapter
of
john
and
the
thirteenth
of
first
corinthians
i
fell
asleep
last
night
while
you
were
reading
i
was
so
tired
i
sleepy
now
very
sleepy
but
keep
awake
this
time
while
you
read
i
got
my
testament
from
my
camp
bag
and
read
both
chapters
through
noting
as
i
read
that
the
look
of
happiness
and
peace
was
returning
to
hubbard
poor
wan
face
when
i
had
finished
he
said
quietly
thank
you
thank
you
very
much
is
that
comforting
not
your
heart
be
troubled
it
makes
me
feel
good
i
faith
that
all
be
saved
i
not
worried
mclean
was
caught
just
as
we
are
he
sent
a
man
for
help
and
got
out
all
right
god
will
send
us
help
too
yes
said
i
and
we
shall
soon
be
safe
home
we
soon
be
safe
home
repeated
hubbard
safe
home
how
happy
that
makes
me
feel
it
was
time
for
george
and
me
to
go
but
i
could
not
say
just
yet
i
turned
my
back
to
hubbard
and
faced
the
fire
the
tears
were
welling
up
into
my
eyes
and
i
struggled
for
george
sat
silent
too
and
his
face
was
strangely
drawn
for
a
full
ten
minutes
we
sat
silently
gazing
into
the
fire
finally
george
arose
well
wallace
we
better
start
now
yes
i
said
we
better
start
i
collected
myself
as
best
i
could
and
turning
to
hubbard
held
out
my
hand
i
be
back
soon
and
then
as
i
looked
into
his
poor
wistful
eyes
i
broke
down
and
sobbed
i
crawled
over
to
him
and
put
my
arm
about
him
i
kissed
his
cheek
and
he
kissed
my
cheek
we
embraced
each
other
and
for
a
moment
held
our
faces
close
together
then
i
drew
away
george
was
crying
too
the
dear
fellow
went
over
to
hubbard
stooped
and
kissed
his
cheek
with
god
help
i
save
you
hubbard
hubbard
kissed
his
cheek
and
they
embraced
george
slung
his
bundle
on
his
shoulder
and
i
took
up
mine
we
turned
to
go
but
i
had
to
return
i
stooped
and
again
kissed
cheek
and
he
again
kissed
mine
he
was
quite
calm
had
been
calm
throughout
only
his
eyes
shone
with
that
look
of
wistful
longing
boys
and
god
be
with
you
and
george
and
i
left
him
about
twenty
yards
away
i
turned
for
a
last
look
at
the
tent
hubbard
evidently
had
immediately
lain
down
for
he
was
not
to
be
seen
all
i
saw
was
the
little
peak
of
balloon
silk
that
had
been
our
home
for
so
many
weeks
the
fire
blazing
between
it
and
the
big
rock
the
kettle
of
water
by
the
fire
and
the
white
moss
and
the
dripping
wet
fir
trees
all
about
some
one
hundred
and
fifty
yards
farther
on
george
and
i
forded
a
brook
after
which
our
course
was
through
diminutive
fir
trees
until
we
came
to
a
series
of
low
barren
knolls
on
these
knolls
we
found
some
mossberries
then
we
pushed
on
it
was
dreadfully
slow
travelling
the
wind
was
in
the
east
and
was
rising
the
drizzling
rain
had
become
a
downpour
and
it
was
dashed
into
our
faces
in
sheets
the
cold
was
increasing
our
hands
were
stiff
and
numb
somewhat
after
midday
george
threw
down
his
pack
we
have
a
spell
rest
and
a
cup
of
tea
to
warm
us
up
he
said
i
did
not
protest
the
previous
night
had
been
a
trying
one
and
i
was
very
tired
we
drew
together
some
wood
with
his
george
whittled
some
shavings
and
a
fire
was
soon
blazing
when
the
kettle
had
been
placed
over
the
fire
to
boil
george
drew
out
of
his
bag
a
package
yes
it
was
a
package
of
pea
meal
at
first
i
could
not
believe
my
eyes
and
i
stood
stupidly
staring
as
george
prepared
to
stir
some
of
it
into
the
kettle
at
length
i
found
my
tongue
george
i
cried
indignantly
where
did
you
get
that
pea
meal
hubbard
gave
it
to
me
this
morning
while
you
were
gettin
wood
he
answered
promptly
but
why
did
you
take
it
he
made
me
take
it
i
did
want
to
but
he
said
i
must
he
said
we
be
workin
hard
and
we
need
it
and
if
we
did
have
to
eat
we
could
travel
far
and
could
get
help
to
him
we
ought
to
have
it
as
much
for
his
sake
as
for
ours
he
said
and
i
had
to
take
it
from
him
to
make
him
feel
right
hubbard
had
evidently
reserved
that
last
of
pea
meal
to
be
used
in
a
last
extremity
and
as
the
argument
he
had
used
to
force
it
on
george
had
been
at
least
specious
i
could
say
nothing
george
put
of
the
package
of
a
pound
into
the
kettle
and
we
each
drank
a
pint
of
the
soup
it
was
very
thin
but
it
did
us
good
after
a
rest
we
pressed
on
as
rapidly
as
possible
but
when
night
overtook
us
we
could
not
have
travelled
more
than
six
miles
from
camp
to
the
storm
as
well
as
our
weakness
was
due
our
slow
progress
as
the
afternoon
wore
on
the
storm
became
furious
the
rain
descended
in
drenching
sheets
and
staggering
blasts
of
wind
drove
it
into
our
faces
even
if
darkness
had
not
stopped
us
further
progress
in
the
face
of
the
tempest
would
have
been
impossible
we
selected
for
our
bivouac
as
sheltered
a
spot
as
possible
in
a
spruce
growth
hauled
together
a
good
supply
of
small
dead
trees
and
made
a
fire
for
supper
we
had
of
what
remained
of
the
pea
meal
reserving
the
other
half
of
a
pound
for
breakfast
there
was
a
little
comfort
to
be
gained
from
the
fire
the
rain
still
descended
upon
us
in
sheets
the
blast
of
wind
drove
the
smoke
into
our
eyes
and
blinded
us
despite
our
weariness
we
could
not
sleep
george
lay
down
but
i
sat
crouching
before
the
fire
we
tried
to
keep
our
pieces
of
blanket
over
our
heads
but
when
we
did
so
we
nearly
suffocated
now
and
again
one
or
the
other
would
rise
to
throw
on
more
wood
towards
midnight
the
wind
shifted
and
snow
began
to
fall
it
fell
as
i
never
saw
snow
fall
before
and
the
wind
never
ceased
and
the
smoke
was
more
blinding
than
ever
and
the
night
grew
colder
there
were
fully
six
inches
of
snow
on
the
ground
when
the
clouds
broke
just
before
dawn
and
before
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
greeted
us
the
wind
died
away
it
was
monday
october
with
the
return
of
daylight
we
ate
the
rest
of
the
pea
meal
and
resumed
our
march
down
the
valley
the
daylight
proved
that
my
eyes
had
been
greatly
affected
by
the
smoke
of
our
night
fire
everything
had
a
hazy
appearance
george
complained
of
the
same
trouble
soon
after
we
started
george
came
upon
a
grouse
track
in
the
fresh
snow
and
followed
it
to
a
clump
of
bushes
a
short
distance
off
he
aimed
his
pistol
with
great
care
but
the
bullet
only
knocked
a
few
feathers
out
of
the
bird
and
it
flew
away
to
george
keen
chagrin
and
my
bitter
disappointment
the
flour
bag
we
were
to
look
for
was
on
the
opposite
or
south
side
of
the
river
and
it
was
necessary
to
cross
before
noon
we
reached
a
place
at
which
george
said
it
would
be
as
easy
to
ford
the
stream
as
at
any
other
the
icy
water
came
almost
up
to
our
armpits
but
we
made
the
other
shore
without
mishap
there
we
halted
to
build
a
fire
and
thaw
ourselves
out
for
immediately
upon
emerging
from
the
river
our
clothing
froze
hard
and
stiff
while
waiting
we
had
some
hot
tea
and
as
quickly
as
possible
pushed
on
we
must
reach
the
flour
bag
that
night
i
found
it
hard
to
keep
the
pace
george
was
setting
and
began
to
lag
wofully
several
times
he
had
to
wait
for
me
to
overtake
him
we
came
upon
a
caribou
trail
in
the
snow
and
followed
it
so
long
as
it
kept
our
direction
to
some
extent
the
broken
path
aided
our
progress
in
the
afternoon
we
came
upon
another
grouse
track
george
followed
it
to
a
clump
of
trees
where
the
bird
was
discovered
sitting
on
a
limb
this
time
his
aim
was
accurate
and
the
bird
fell
at
his
feet
quickly
he
plucked
the
wings
cut
them
off
and
handed
me
one
with
the
remark
they
say
raw
partridge
is
good
when
a
fellus
weak
it
was
delicious
i
ate
the
wing
warm
with
the
bird
life
blood
bones
and
all
and
george
ate
the
other
wing
i
soon
found
it
utterly
impossible
to
keep
george
pace
and
became
so
exhausted
that
i
was
forced
to
take
short
rests
at
length
i
told
george
he
had
better
go
ahead
and
look
for
the
flour
that
i
should
rest
follow
his
trail
and
overtake
him
later
he
went
on
but
just
over
the
bare
knoll
we
were
crossing
i
found
him
sitting
in
the
snow
waiting
for
me
i
do
feel
right
to
go
ahead
and
leave
you
he
said
do
you
see
that
second
knoll
he
pointed
to
one
of
a
series
of
round
barren
knolls
about
half
a
mile
down
the
river
yes
i
answered
well
do
you
remember
it
no
why
that
where
we
camped
when
we
threw
the
flour
away
and
that
where
we
stop
better
eat
a
mouthful
to
help
us
on
he
had
plucked
the
head
and
neck
of
the
grouse
and
now
proceeded
to
cut
them
off
near
the
body
to
me
he
gave
the
neck
and
ate
the
head
himself
raw
of
course
it
was
just
dusk
when
we
reached
the
knoll
george
had
designated
straightway
he
went
to
a
bush
ran
his
hand
under
it
and
pulled
out
the
bag
we
were
looking
for
we
opened
it
eagerly
as
has
been
said
we
left
about
four
pounds
of
flour
in
it
now
there
was
a
lump
of
green
and
black
mould
however
we
rejoiced
at
finding
it
for
it
was
something
and
it
might
sustain
our
lives
it
might
send
george
to
the
lard
and
keep
hubbard
and
me
until
help
could
arrive
on
this
side
of
the
susan
the
country
for
some
distance
had
been
burned
but
while
there
were
no
standing
trees
and
the
place
was
entirely
unsheltered
fallen
spruce
trees
covered
the
ground
in
every
direction
so
we
found
no
difficulty
in
getting
together
a
good
pile
of
dry
wood
for
our
night
fire
and
we
soon
had
a
rousing
big
one
going
for
supper
we
ate
all
of
the
grouse
boiled
with
some
of
the
flour
mould
stirred
in
it
was
a
splendid
supper
i
had
not
sat
long
before
the
fire
when
i
felt
a
strange
sensation
in
my
eyes
it
was
as
if
they
had
been
filled
with
sharp
splinters
and
i
found
it
impossible
to
open
them
i
was
afflicted
with
which
is
almost
identical
in
its
effect
to
george
filled
my
pipe
with
dried
tea
leaves
and
just
a
bit
of
his
precious
tobacco
then
lit
it
for
me
as
i
could
not
see
to
do
it
myself
after
our
smoke
we
lay
down
and
i
slept
heavily
it
was
practically
the
first
sleep
i
had
had
in
three
days
some
time
in
the
night
george
awoke
me
to
make
me
eat
a
little
of
a
concoction
of
the
mouldy
flour
and
water
cooked
thick
and
a
trifle
burned
after
the
style
of
nekapooshet
an
indian
dish
of
which
george
was
very
fond
at
the
first
signs
of
dawn
he
again
roused
me
saying
it
time
to
be
up
wallace
we
goin
to
have
more
snow
to
travel
in
he
was
right
the
clouds
were
hanging
low
and
heavy
and
the
first
scattering
flakes
were
falling
of
a
storm
that
was
to
last
for
ten
days
i
was
able
to
open
my
eyes
in
the
morning
but
everything
still
looked
hazy
we
boiled
some
of
the
wretched
mouldy
flour
for
breakfast
and
then
divided
what
remained
george
taking
the
larger
share
as
he
had
the
most
work
to
do
looking
critically
at
my
share
he
asked
how
long
can
you
keep
alive
on
that
it
will
take
me
two
days
to
reach
hubbard
i
replied
and
the
two
of
us
might
live
three
days
more
on
it
on
a
pinch
do
you
think
you
can
live
as
long
as
that
said
george
looking
me
hard
in
the
eye
i
try
i
said
then
in
five
days
i
have
help
to
you
if
there
help
to
be
had
at
grand
lake
day
after
i
be
at
grand
lake
those
be
strong
and
can
reach
camp
in
two
days
so
expect
it
was
time
for
us
to
separate
george
i
asked
have
you
your
testament
with
you
it
the
book
of
common
prayer
he
said
drawing
it
from
his
pocket
but
it
got
the
psalms
in
it
he
handed
me
the
tiny
book
but
i
could
not
see
the
print
the
haze
before
my
eyes
was
too
thick
i
returned
the
book
to
him
and
asked
him
to
read
one
of
the
psalms
quite
at
haphazard
i
am
sure
he
turned
to
the
and
this
is
what

thou
tread

hath
set
his
love
upon

therefore
will
i
deliver
him
i
will
set
him
up
because
he
hath
known
my
name
he
shall
call
upon
me
and
i
will
hear
him
yea
i
am
with
him
in
trouble
i
will
deliver
him
and
bring
him
to
bonour
with
long
life
will
i
satisfy
him
and
show
him
my
salvation
the
psalm
made
a
deep
impression
upon
me
for
he
shall
give
his
angels
charge
over
thee
to
keep
thee
in
all
thy
ways
how
strange
it
seems
in
view
of
what
happened
to
me
that
george
should
have
read
that
sentence
we
arose
to
go
on
our
separate
ways
george
miles
down
the
valley
to
grand
lake
and
i
fifteen
miles
up
the
valley
to
hubbard
the
snow
was
falling
thick
and
fast
you
better
make
a
cape
of
your
blanket
suggested
george
let
me
fix
it
for
you
he
placed
the
blanket
around
my
shoulders
and
on
either
side
of
the
cloth
where
it
came
together
under
my
chin
made
a
small
hole
with
his
knife
through
these
holes
he
ran
a
piece
of
our
old
trolling
line
and
tied
the
ends
then
he
similarly
arranged
his
own
blanket
i
held
out
my
hand
to
him
george
take
care
of
yourself
he
clasped
my
hand
warmly
wallace
expect
help
in
five
days
near
the
top
of
a
knoll
i
stopped
and
looked
back
with
my
afflicted
eyes
i
could
barely
make
out
george
ascending
another
knoll
he
also
stopped
and
looked
back
i
waved
my
hand
to
him
and
he
waved
his
hand
to
me
and
shouted
something
unintelligible
then
he
disappeared
in
the
snow
and
as
he
disappeared
a
silence
came
on
the
world
to
remain
unbroken
for
ten
days
xviii
wandering
alone
with
every
hour
the
storm
gathered
new
force
and
over
the
barren
knolls
along
which
my
course
for
some
distance
lay
the
snow
whirled
furiously
the
track
george
and
i
had
made
on
our
downward
journey
soon
was
obliterated
once
in
the
forenoon
as
i
pushed
blindly
on
against
the
storm
i
heard
a
snort
and
looking
up
beheld
only
a
few
yards
away
a
big
caribou
he
was
standing
directly
in
my
path
for
a
second
he
regarded
me
with
his
head
thrown
back
in
fear
and
wonder
and
then
giving
another
snort
he
dashed
away
into
the
maze
of
whirling
snow
my
eyes
troubled
me
greatly
and
the
pain
at
length
grew
so
intense
that
i
was
forced
to
sit
down
in
the
snow
for
perhaps
half
an
hour
with
both
eyes
tightly
closed
i
was
keeping
some
distance
from
the
river
as
the
obstructions
here
were
fewer
than
near
the
bank
in
the
afternoon
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
have
turned
in
my
course
and
i
took
my
compass
from
its
case
to
satisfy
myself
that
i
was
going
in
the
right
direction
but
my
sight
was
so
impaired
that
i
could
not
read
the
dial
nor
be
certain
which
way
the
needle
pointed
and
i
wondered
vaguely
whether
i
was
becoming
totally
blind
my
day
progress
was
not
satisfactory
i
had
hoped
to
reach
the
place
where
george
and
i
had
forded
the
river
and
cross
to
the
north
shore
before
bivouacking
but
in
the
deepening
snow
it
was
impossible
with
the
first
indications
of
night
i
halted
in
a
thick
spruce
grove
near
the
river
and
drew
together
a
fairly
good
supply
of
dead
wood
on
the
under
side
of
the
branches
of
the
fir
trees
was
generally
to
be
found
a
thick
growth
of
hairy
moss
and
with
a
handful
of
this
as
tinder
it
did
not
take
me
long
to
get
a
good
fire
blazing
close
to
the
fire
i
threw
a
pile
of
spruce
boughs
that
i
broke
from
low
branches
and
the
smaller
trees
i
melted
snow
in
my
cup
for
water
and
in
this
put
a
few
lumps
of
mould
from
the
flour
bag
eating
the
mixture
after
it
had
cooked
a
while
on
the
couch
of
boughs
by
the
fire
i
spent
a
fairly
comfortable
night
waking
only
at
intervals
to
throw
on
more
wood
and
shake
the
snow
from
my
back
the
storm
was
still
raging
in
the
morning
wednesday
october
with
the
first
grey
streaks
of
dawn
i
boiled
another
cup
of
snow
water
and
mould
and
then
slinging
the
flour
bag
over
my
shoulder
began
my
day
struggle
the
snow
was
now
soon
i
reached
the
fording
place
the
river
was
beginning
to
freeze
over
for
two
or
three
yards
from
shore
the
ice
bore
my
weight
then
i
sank
up
to
my
waist
in
the
cold
current
approaching
the
other
shore
i
broke
the
outer
ice
with
my
arms
until
it
became
thick
enough
to
permit
me
to
climb
out
upon
it
the
ice
that
immediately
formed
on
my
clothing
make
walking
impossible
and
reluctantly
i
halted
to
build
a
fire
and
dry
myself
this
took
fully
an
hour
and
a
half
to
my
extreme
vexation
i
realised
now
that
my
hope
of
reaching
hubbard
that
night
was
vain
while
i
dried
my
clothing
i
made
a
cup
of
tea
i
had
just
enough
left
for
two
brewings
so
after
drinking
the
tea
i
preserved
the
leaves
for
further
use
wrapping
them
carefully
in
a
bit
of
rag
once
more
on
my
way
up
the
valley
i
found
to
my
consternation
and
almost
despair
that
my
eyes
would
again
compel
me
to
stop
and
for
nearly
an
hour
i
sat
with
them
closed
that
night
with
the
snow
still
falling
though
very
lightly
i
made
my
couch
of
boughs
by
a
fairly
comfortable
fire
and
rested
well
on
thursday
morning
october
a
light
snow
was
failing
and
the
weather
was
very
cold
the
cup
of
thin
gruel
that
i
made
from
the
green
lumps
of
mould
nauseated
me
and
i
had
to
brew
some
tea
to
settle
my
stomach
and
stimulate
me
with
my
piece
of
blanket
drawn
over
my
head
to
protect
my
ears
from
the
biting
wind
and
with
my
hands
wrapped
in
the
folds
i
continued
my
struggle
towards
camp
i
had
to
force
my
way
blindly
and
desperately
through
thick
clumps
of
fir
trees
and
as
the
branches
were
hanging
low
under
their
weight
of
feathery
snow
i
continually
received
a
deluge
of
snow
in
my
face
my
stock
of
matches
was
small
and
time
was
precious
and
i
did
not
stop
at
noon
to
build
a
fire
even
when
night
began
to
close
in
upon
me
i
still
plodded
on
believing
that
i
now
must
be
near
hubbard
the
snow
was
falling
gently
and
as
there
was
a
moon
behind
the
clouds
the
night
was
sufficiently
light
for
me
to
make
my
way
tediously
through
the
trees
with
the
roar
of
the
rapids
to
guide
me
it
must
have
been
near
midnight
when
utterly
exhausted
i
was
forced
to
abandon
the
hope
of
finding
hubbard
before
morning
fearing
that
the
mould
would
again
sicken
me
i
ate
nothing
when
i
halted
i
simply
collected
a
few
dry
sticks
and
huddled
for
the
remainder
of
the
night
by
a
miserable
fire
dozing
and
awaking
with
a
shudder
from
awful
dreams
the
storm
continued
during
the
night
and
with
the
morning
of
friday
october
broke
upon
the
world
and
me
with
renewed
fury
i
prepared
myself
another
dose
of
the
mould
and
forced
it
down
i
was
nervously
anxious
to
get
on
and
find
hubbard
i
knew
i
must
be
near
him
now
although
the
snow
had
changed
the
whole
face
of
the
country
and
obliterated
all
the
landmarks
soon
i
crossed
a
brook
frozen
and
covered
with
snow
that
i
felt
must
be
the
one
near
our
camp
eagerly
i
looked
about
me
for
the
tent
because
of
the
falling
snow
and
the
branches
i
could
scarcely
see
twenty
yards
in
any
direction
from
rock
to
rock
i
went
believing
each
in
turn
to
be
the
tent
but
always
to
meet
disappointment
repeatedly
i
stopped
to
peer
into
the
maze
of
snow
for
smoke
but
there
was
none
again
and
again
i
shouted
but
there
was
no
answer
the
tent
was
really
near
me
but
it
kept
its
secret
well
i
travelled
on
and
on
i
became
desperate
over
and
over
i
repeated
to
myself
i
must
find
hubbard
before
night
comes
i
must
find
him
i
must
i
must
at
length
the
first
signs
of
night
warned
me
that
i
must
collect
my
wood
that
i
might
be
as
comfortable
as
possible
through
the
dreary
hours
of
darkness
as
night
came
on
the
storm
moderated
the
wind
ceased
an
unwonted
solemn
awful
stillness
came
upon
the
world
it
seemed
to
choke
me
i
was
filled
with
an
unutterable
a
sickening
dread
hubbard
face
as
i
had
last
seen
it
was
constantly
before
me
was
he
looking
and
waiting
for
me
why
could
i
not
find
him
i
must
find
him
in
the
morning
i
must
i
must
before
going
to
sleep
i
made
some
more
gruel
and
tea
drinking
them
both
as
a
duty
the
snow
was
falling
gently
on
saturday
october
the
wind
had
mercifully
abated
and
the
temperature
was
somewhat
milder
after
more
gruel
and
the
last
cup
of
tea
i
was
to
have
in
my
lonely
wanderings
i
renewed
my
search
for
hubbard
i
decided
that
possibly
i
was
below
the
camp
and
pushed
on
to
the
westward
finally
i
became
convinced
i
was
in
a
part
of
the
country
i
had
never
seen
before
i
began
to
feel
that
possibly
i
was
far
above
the
camp
that
a
rescuing
party
had
found
hubbard
and
that
as
my
tracks
in
the
snow
had
been
covered
they
had
abandoned
the
hope
of
finding
me
and
had
returned
they
might
even
have
passed
me
in
the
valley
below
it
was
quite
possible
but
perhaps
george
strength
had
failed
him
and
help
never
would
come
to
any
of
us
i
turned
about
and
again
started
down
the
valley
after
a
time
i
attempted
to
cross
the
ice
on
the
river
to
try
and
discover
some
familiar
landmark
on
the
south
shore
in
midstream
where
the
current
had
not
permitted
thick
ice
to
form
i
broke
through
the
water
was
nearly
up
to
my
armpits
standing
there
with
the
icy
current
swirling
about
me
i
said
what
the
use
it
seemed
to
me
i
had
reached
the
limit
of
human
endurance
instead
of
trying
to
struggle
on
how
much
pleasanter
to
permit
myself
to
sink
beneath
the
water
and
thus
end
it
all
it
would
be
such
a
relief
to
die
then
there
came
to
me
the
remembrance
that
it
was
my
duty
to
live
as
long
as
i
could
i
must
do
my
best
as
long
as
i
had
any
strength
left
i
must
exert
myself
to
live
with
a
great
effort
i
climbed
out
on
the
hard
ice
and
made
my
way
back
to
the
north
shore
night
was
approaching
i
staggered
into
the
spruce
growth
and
there
came
upon
the
same
brook
i
have
previously
mentioned
as
crossing
near
its
bank
i
made
my
night
fire
that
fire
was
within
two
hundred
yards
of
the
tent
perhaps
it
is
just
as
well
that
i
did
not
know
it
the
snow
which
had
fallen
rather
mildly
all
day
thickened
with
the
coming
of
night
all
the
loose
wood
was
now
buried
under
the
snow
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
i
gathered
a
scant
supply
for
the
night
my
wet
rags
were
freezing
hard
and
stiff
i
moved
about
i
broke
only
a
few
branches
for
my
bed
and
sat
down
scarcely
had
i
done
so
when
a
woman
voice
came
to
me
kindly
and
low
and
encouraging
had
you
better
break
a
few
more
boughs
it
said
you
will
rest
better
then
there
was
no
mistaking
the
voice
it
was
clear
and
distinct
it
was
the
voice
of
my
wife
who
had
been
dead
for
more
than
three
years
i
remember
it
did
not
impress
me
as
being
at
all
strange
that
my
wife
who
was
dead
should
be
speaking
to
me
up
there
in
the
labrador
wilderness
it
seemed
to
me
perfectly
natural
that
she
should
be
looking
after
my
comfort
even
as
she
had
done
in
life
i
arose
and
broke
the
boughs
i
am
not
a
spiritist
i
have
never
taken
any
stock
in
the
theory
that
the
spirits
of
the
dead
are
able
to
communicate
with
the
living
so
far
as
i
have
thought
about
them
at
all
it
has
been
my
opinion
that
spiritists
are
either
fools
or
frauds
but
i
am
endeavouring
to
give
a
faithful
account
of
my
feelings
and
sensations
at
the
time
of
which
i
am
writing
and
the
incident
of
the
voice
can
not
be
ignored
perhaps
it
was
all
a
delusion
an
hallucination
if
you
will
due
to
the
gradual
breaking
down
of
my
body
and
mind
as
to
that
the
reader
can
form
his
own
conclusions
certain
it
is
that
from
this
time
on
when
i
needed
help
and
encouragement
the
most
i
felt
a
vague
assurance
that
my
wife
was
by
my
side
and
i
verily
believe
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
this
hallucination
delusion
actuality
reality
or
whatever
it
may
have
been
i
should
now
be
in
a
land
where
the
truth
about
these
things
is
probably
known
for
certain
at
times
i
even
thought
i
saw
my
wife
and
often
often
throughout
those
terrible
days
her
voice
came
to
me
kindly
and
low
and
encouraging
when
i
felt
i
really
could
plod
no
farther
through
the
snow
her
voice
would
tell
me
not
to
lose
heart
but
to
do
my
best
and
all
would
be
right
in
the
end
and
when
wearied
beyond
measure
at
night
i
would
fall
into
a
heavy
sleep
and
my
fire
would
burn
low
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
would
arouse
me
and
her
voice
would
tell
me
to
get
up
and
throw
on
more
wood
now
and
again
i
fancied
i
heard
the
voice
of
my
mother
who
died
when
i
was
a
boy
also
encouraging
and
reassuring
me
indescribably
comforting
were
those
voices
whatever
their
origin
may
have
been
they
soothed
me
and
brought
balm
for
my
loneliness
in
the
wilderness
and
amid
the
falling
snow
those
that
loved
me
were
ministering
unto
me
and
keeping
me
from
harm
at
least
so
it
seemed
to
me
and
now
as
i
think
of
those
dear
voices
and
feel
once
more
that
loving
touch
on
my
shoulder
there
comes
back
to
me
that
verse
from
the
psalm
george
read
at
our
parting
for
he
shall
give
his
angels
charge
over
thee
to
keep
thee
in
all
thy
ways
it
is
all
like
a
to
me
now
i
know
that
after
saturday
night
october
when
i
bivouacked
within
a
stone
throw
of
hubbard
tent
i
lost
all
count
of
the
days
and
soon
could
not
recall
even
the
month
i
travelled
on
and
on
always
down
the
valley
sometimes
i
fancied
i
heard
men
shouting
and
i
would
reply
but
the
men
did
not
come
and
i
would
say
to
myself
over
and
over
again
man
proposes
god
disposes
it
is
his
will
and
best
for
all
the
flour
mould
nauseated
me
to
such
an
extent
that
for
a
day
at
a
time
i
could
not
force
myself
to
eat
it
the
snow
clogged
in
all
that
was
left
of
my
cowhide
moccasins
larigans
and
i
took
them
off
and
fastened
them
to
my
belt
walking
thereafter
in
my
stocking
feet
i
wore
two
pairs
of
woollen
socks
but
holes
already
were
beginning
to
appear
in
the
toes
and
heels
the
bushes
tore
away
the
legs
of
my
trousers
completely
and
my
drawers
which
thus
became
the
sole
protection
of
my
legs
from
the
middle
of
my
thighs
down
had
big
holes
in
them
each
night
i
cut
a
piece
of
leather
from
my
moccasin
uppers
and
boiled
it
in
my
cup
until
morning
when
i
would
eat
it
and
drink
the
water
i
found
afterward
carefully
preserved
in
my
match
box
one
of
the
brass
eyelets
from
the
moccasins
probably
i
put
it
away
thinking
i
might
have
to
eat
even
that
i
knew
there
was
something
the
matter
with
my
feet
they
complained
to
me
every
night
they
seemed
to
me
like
individuals
that
were
dependent
upon
me
and
they
told
me
it
was
my
duty
to
care
for
them
but
i
gave
no
heed
to
their
complaints
i
had
enough
to
do
to
care
for
myself
my
feet
must
look
out
for
themselves
why
should
i
worry
about
them
and
still
it
snowed
night
and
day
sometimes
gently
sometimes
blindingly
but
always
it
snowed
once
while
plodding
along
the
side
of
a
rocky
hill
i
staggered
over
the
edge
of
a
shelving
rock
and
fell
several
feet
into
a
snow
drift
i
was
uninjured
but
extricating
myself
was
desperately
hard
work
and
it
was
very
pleasant
and
soft
in
the
snow
and
i
was
so
tired
and
sleepy
why
not
give
it
up
and
go
to
sleep
but
she
was
with
me
and
she
whispered
struggle
on
and
all
will
be
well
and
reluctantly
i
dragged
my
poor
old
body
out
there
were
times
when
the
feeling
was
strong
upon
me
that
i
had
been
alone
and
wandering
on
forever
and
that
like
the
wandering
jew
i
must
go
on
forever
at
other
times
i
fancied
i
was
dead
and
that
the
wilderness
was
another
world
instinctively
i
built
my
fire
at
night
under
the
stump
of
a
fallen
tree
if
i
could
find
one
for
the
rotten
wood
would
smoulder
until
morning
and
a
supply
of
other
wood
was
very
hard
to
get
one
evening
i
remember
crossing
the
river
which
had
now
gone
into
its
long
winter
sleep
tucked
away
under
a
blanket
of
ice
and
snow
and
building
a
fire
under
a
rotten
stump
on
the
south
side
behind
a
bank
near
the
shore
i
felt
that
i
must
be
well
down
the
valley
my
supply
of
wood
was
miserably
small
but
i
had
worked
hard
all
day
and
could
not
gather
any
more
i
fell
down
by
the
fire
and
struggled
against
sleep
she
told
me
i
must
not
sleep
when
i
dozed
her
hand
on
my
shoulder
would
arouse
me
thus
the
night
passed
at
dawn
i
realised
in
a
vague
sort
of
way
that
the
clouds
had
at
last
broken
away
that
the
weather
was
clear
and
biting
cold
before
me
was
the
river
it
had
been
a
raging
torrent
when
i
first
saw
it
now
it
lay
quiet
and
still
under
its
heavy
winter
blanket
at
my
back
the
low
bank
with
its
stunted
spruce
trees
hid
the
ridge
of
barren
rocky
hills
and
knolls
that
lay
beyond
a
few
embers
of
the
rotten
stump
were
smouldering
sending
skyward
with
each
fitful
gust
of
the
east
wind
a
fugitive
curl
of
smoke
a
few
yards
away
lay
a
dead
tree
with
its
branches
close
to
the
snow
if
i
could
break
some
of
those
branches
off
and
get
them
back
to
my
smouldering
stump
i
might
fan
the
embers
into
a
blaze
get
some
heat
and
melt
snow
in
my
cup
for
a
hot
drink
not
that
i
craved
the
drink
or
anything
else
but
it
perhaps
would
give
me
strength
to
go
just
a
little
farther
i
pulled
my
piece
of
ragged
blanket
over
my
shoulders
and
struggled
to
my
feet
it
was
no
use
i
swayed
dizzily
about
took
a
few
steps
forward
and
fell
i
crawled
slowly
back
to
the
smouldering
stump
and
tried
to
think
i
felt
no
pain
i
was
just
weary
to
the
last
degree
should
i
not
now
be
justified
in
surrendering
to
the
overpowering
desire
to
sleep
perhaps
i
argued
it
would
strengthen
me
i
could
no
longer
walk
why
not
sleep
but
still
i
was
told
that
i
must
not
was
hubbard
still
waiting
and
watching
for
me
to
come
back
somewhere
in
that
still
wilderness
of
snow
was
he
waiting
and
watching
and
hoping
perhaps
he
was
dead
and
at
rest
poor
hubbard
why
did
not
the
men
come
to
look
for
us
the
trappers
that
george
was
to
send
had
they
come
and
missed
me
and
gone
away
again
or
was
george
brave
fellow
lying
dead
on
the
trail
somewhere
below
how
long
had
i
been
wandering
anyway
my
sisters
in
new
york
were
they
hoping
and
praying
to
hear
from
me
perhaps
they
never
would
there
was
a
certain
grave
in
a
little
cemetery
on
the
banks
of
the
dear
old
hudson
it
had
been
arranged
that
i
should
lie
beside
that
grave
when
i
went
to
sleep
forever
would
they
find
my
bones
and
take
them
back
how
enthusiastic
hubbard
had
been
for
this
expedition
it
was
going
to
make
his
reputation
he
thought
well
well
man
proposes
god
disposes
it
was
his
will
and
best
for
all
i
found
myself
dozing
and
with
an
effort
to
recover
myself
sat
up
straight
the
sun
was
making
its
way
above
the
horizon
i
looked
at
it
and
hoped
that
its
warming
rays
would
give
me
strength
to
do
my
duty
my
duty
to
live
as
long
as
i
could
anyway
the
storms
had
passed
the
storms
had
passed
i
dozed
again
it
may
have
been
that
i
was
entering
upon
my
final
sleep
but
gradually
i
became
hazily
conscious
of
an
unusual
sound
was
it
a
shout
i
was
aroused
i
made
a
great
effort
and
got
on
my
feet
i
listened
there
it
was
again
it
was
a
shout
i
felt
sure
it
was
a
shout
with
every
bit
of
energy
at
my
command
i
sent
up
an
answering
hello
all
was
silent
i
began
to
fear
that
again
i
had
been
deceived
then
over
the
bank
above
me
came
four
swarthy
men
on
with
big
packs
on
their
backs
xix
the
kindness
of
the
breeds
the
unintelligible
words
that
george
shouted
to
me
from
the
knoll
after
we
parted
on
tuesday
october
were
an
injunction
to
keep
near
the
river
as
the
men
he
would
send
to
rescue
hubbard
and
me
would
look
for
us
there
as
he
proceeded
down
the
valley
his
progress
was
slow
and
tedious
owing
to
his
weakness
the
rough
country
and
the
deepening
snow
towards
noon
he
came
upon
the
newly
made
track
of
a
porcupine
followed
it
a
short
distance
into
a
clump
of
trees
where
he
soon
saw
the
round
animal
in
the
snow
and
shot
it
immediately
he
built
a
fire
and
singed
off
quills
and
hair
then
as
he
related
to
me
afterwards
he
considered
talking
aloud
to
himself
what
was
best
to
do
with
his
prize
there
them
fellus
up
there
without
grub
he
said
maybe
better
turn
about
and
take
this
porcupine
but
if
i
do
it
last
long
and
then
we
be
worse
off
than
ever
this
snow
deeper
all
the
time
and
if
it
gets
so
deep
i
ca
walk
without
snowshoes
we
all
die
for
sure
no
i
better
go
on
with
this
porcupine
to
help
me
so
after
boiling
a
piece
of
the
porcupine
in
his
tea
kettle
and
eating
it
he
continued
down
the
valley
by
his
fires
be
always
talked
to
himself
to
keep
himself
company
and
that
night
he
said
this
been
a
tough
day
and
i
ai
where
i
ought
to
be
but
eat
a
good
snack
of
this
porcupine
now
with
some
of
the
flour
and
in
the
mornin
i
have
another
good
snack
and
that
make
me
stronger
and
i
can
travel
farther
i
ought
to
get
most
to
grand
lake
night
but
so
far
from
getting
anywhere
near
grand
lake
the
next
day
he
did
not
complete
his
journey
for
several
days
to
come
the
snow
became
so
deep
he
could
hardly
push
through
it
he
carefully
hoarded
the
bones
of
his
porcupine
thinking
he
might
have
to
eat
them
but
providence
sent
him
more
food
when
the
first
porcupine
was
eaten
he
came
upon
and
killed
another
and
when
that
was
gone
he
shot
a
third
he
also
succeeded
in
shooting
several
grouse
if
it
had
not
been
for
this
game
he
would
not
have
lived
to
do
the
hard
work
that
was
before
him
the
pieces
of
blanket
in
which
his
feet
were
wrapped
were
continually
coming
off
and
frequent
halts
were
necessary
to
readjust
them
he
must
not
let
his
feet
freeze
for
then
he
would
not
be
able
to
walk
and
not
only
would
he
perish
himself
but
there
be
no
hope
for
them
fellus
up
there
one
day
he
came
upon
a
man
track
he
was
exultant
that
it
was
a
trapper
trail
he
had
no
doubt
staggering
along
it
with
all
the
speed
he
could
command
he
shouted
wildly
at
every
step
presently
he
discovered
that
he
was
following
his
own
trail
he
had
been
travelling
in
a
circle
the
discovery
made
him
almost
frantic
he
stopped
to
reason
with
and
calm
himself
said
he
so
that
all
the
listening
wilderness
might
hear
them
fellus
up
there
in
the
snow
have
got
to
be
saved
i
said
to
hubbard
god
help
i
save
you
and
i
to
if
my
legs
hold
out
and
there
anybody
at
grand
lake
and
then
he
went
on
his
progress
down
the
valley
that
day
was
only
a
mile
and
a
half
it
was
most
discouraging
he
must
do
better
the
powdered
milk
we
had
abandoned
he
did
not
find
but
on
october
he
recovered
our
old
lard
pail
some
of
the
lard
he
ate
some
he
used
in
cooking
a
grouse
and
the
rest
he
took
along
with
him
below
the
place
where
he
bivouacked
that
night
the
snow
was
not
so
deep
and
early
the
next
morning
george
once
more
beheld
the
broad
waters
of
grand
lake
the
journey
he
had
expected
to
make
in
three
days
had
actually
taken
him
seven
he
arrived
at
grand
lake
three
days
after
i
wandering
in
the
valley
above
lost
all
track
of
time
a
few
miles
above
its
mouth
the
susan
river
bends
to
the
southward
and
from
that
direction
reaches
the
little
lake
that
lies
just
north
of
the
extreme
western
end
of
grand
lake
so
that
george
proceeding
down
the
river
on
the
south
bank
eventually
came
to
the
little
lake
western
shore
along
this
shore
he
made
his
way
until
he
reached
the
point
of
land
formed
by
the
little
lake
and
the
branch
of
the
beaver
river
that
flows
a
little
south
of
east
to
merge
its
waters
in
the
little
lake
with
those
of
the
susan
the
water
here
had
not
been
frozen
and
george
found
his
further
progress
arrested
he
was
in
a
quandary
the
trapper
tilt
for
which
he
was
bound
was
on
the
south
shore
of
grand
lake
about
seven
or
eight
miles
from
its
western
end
and
in
order
to
reach
the
tilt
he
would
have
to
continue
on
south
around
the
end
of
the
lake
the
land
on
the
other
side
of
the
swirling
stream
to
which
george
had
come
was
the
island
at
the
mouth
of
the
beaver
that
separates
it
into
two
branches
and
which
forms
the
western
shore
of
the
swift
stream
or
strait
that
flowing
to
the
southward
discharges
the
waters
of
the
little
lake
into
grand
lake
george
thought
however
that
this
island
was
a
part
of
the
western
boundary
of
grand
lake
and
he
determined
to
reach
it
but
how
to
swim
across
was
impossible
well
then
he
would
build
a
raft
and
although
he
had
no
implements
he
did
he
hauled
together
several
fallen
trees
laid
them
in
a
row
and
bound
them
at
one
end
with
his
pack
strap
and
at
the
other
with
a
piece
of
our
old
trolling
line
when
this
was
done
he
hacked
himself
a
pole
with
his
threw
his
bag
containing
a
piece
of
a
porcupine
and
some
grouse
on
the
raft
launched
it
jumped
on
it
himself
and
pushed
out
into
the
stream
one
or
two
good
shoves
george
gave
with
his
pole
and
then
found
he
no
longer
could
touch
bottom
he
was
at
the
mercy
of
the
swift
current
down
into
the
little
lake
he
was
swept
and
thence
through
the
strait
right
out
into
grand
lake
a
high
sea
was
running
and
the
frail
raft
promptly
began
to
fall
to
pieces
have
i
escaped
starvin
only
to
drown
thought
george
it
certainly
looked
like
it
but
said
he
to
himself
if
i
drown
them
fellus
up
there
will
be
up
against
it
for
sure
so
he
determined
not
to
drown
he
got
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
and
although
the
icy
seas
broke
relentlessly
over
him
he
held
the
floating
sticks
in
place
at
the
same
time
clinging
tenaciously
to
his
food
bag
for
as
he
confided
to
me
later
it
would
have
been
just
as
bad
to
escape
drownin
only
to
starve
as
it
would
have
been
to
escape
starvin
only
to
drown
farther
out
on
the
broad
bosom
of
the
lake
george
was
carried
now
said
he
if
i
jump
i
drown
and
if
i
do
i
drown
anyway
so
i
guess
i
hang
on
a
little
longer
and
hang
on
he
did
for
something
like
two
hours
when
the
wind
caught
his
raft
and
drove
it
back
to
the
southern
end
of
the
island
at
the
mouth
of
the
beaver
you
ca
lose
me
said
george
as
he
landed
he
and
his
game
bag
were
saved
but
his
difficulties
were
not
ended
by
any
means
while
the
wind
was
driving
him
back
george
caught
sight
of
the
branch
of
the
beaver
that
flows
almost
due
south
directly
into
grand
lake
forming
the
island
western
shore
standing
on
this
shore
he
made
a
shrewd
guess
i
bet
he
said
my
dream
was
right
and
here
we
have
the
same
river
we
were
on
when
we
said
to
the
canoe
what
interested
him
the
most
however
was
a
row
boat
he
espied
a
little
south
of
the
island
on
the
opposite
shore
apparently
it
had
been
abandoned
if
can
reach
that
boat
said
george
and
float
and
i
do
find
blake
or
any
grab
at
his
tilt
i
put
right
off
for
the
post
and
send
help
from
there
to
them
fellus
up
there
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
he
would
have
to
take
chances
with
another
raft
although
his
rags
were
beginning
to
freeze
to
his
body
he
did
not
stop
to
build
a
fire
neither
did
he
wait
to
eat
anything
at
first
it
seemed
hopeless
to
try
to
launch
a
raft
for
the
bank
on
the
western
side
of
the
island
was
very
steep
farther
north
however
ice
had
formed
in
the
river
for
some
distance
from
the
shore
and
to
this
ice
george
dragged
fallen
trees
and
bound
them
as
he
had
done
before
it
was
the
labour
of
hours
the
trees
having
to
be
dragged
for
considerable
distances
once
more
afloat
george
found
no
difficulty
in
touching
bottom
with
his
pole
and
in
the
gathering
dusk
he
reached
the
other
shore
supposing
that
he
was
still
many
miles
from
a
place
where
there
was
any
possibility
of
finding
a
human
being
he
decided
to
bivouac
for
the
night
but
first
he
must
examine
the
rowboat
he
had
sighted
from
the
island
this
made
necessary
the
fording
of
a
small
stream
hardly
had
he
emerged
from
the
water
when
from
among
the
spruce
trees
farther
back
from
the
shore
there
came
a
sound
that
brought
him
to
a
sudden
standstill
and
set
his
heart
to
thumping
wildly
against
his
ribs
it
was
a
most
extraordinary
sound
to
hear
when
one
supposed
one
was
alone
in
a
wilderness
and
when
all
had
been
solemnly
still
save
for
the
dashing
of
waves
upon
a
shore
on
the
night
air
there
came
floating
to
george
the
cry
of
a
little
child
when
i
heard
that
youngster
scream
said
george
in
telling
me
about
the
incident
i
knew
folks
was
there
and
i
dropped
my
bag
and
i
tore
my
piece
of
blanket
from
my
shoulders
and
i
runned
and
i
runned
in
the
course
of
the
summer
donald
blake
had
built
himself
a
log
house
on
the
spot
to
which
george
was
so
wildly
fleeing
the
rowboat
george
had
spied
belonged
to
him
but
the
house
standing
back
in
a
thick
clump
of
trees
had
not
been
visible
from
the
water
on
the
evening
of
george
arrival
donald
and
his
brother
gilbert
were
away
and
donald
wife
and
another
young
woman
who
stayed
with
her
to
keep
her
company
were
alone
the
latter
young
woman
with
blake
baby
in
her
arms
was
standing
at
the
door
of
the
house
when
suddenly
she
heard
a
crashing
noise
in
the
bush
in
front
of
her
and
the
next
moment
there
loomed
up
before
her
affrighted
vision
in
the
gloaming
the
apparition
of
a
gaunt
and
ragged
man
dripping
wet
and
running
towards
her
with
long
black
hair
and
straggling
beard
streaming
in
the
wind
she
turned
and
fled
into
the
house
o
blake
o
mrs
blake
she
cried
is
somethin
dreadful
comin
is
sure
a
wild
man
greatly
alarmed
blake
went
to
the
door
george
panting
and
still
dripping
stood
before
her
lord
ha
mercy
she
piously
exclaimed
throwing
up
her
arms
do
be
scared
ladies
panted
george
i
could
hurt
a
rabbit
ai
there
any
men
here
his
ingratiating
manner
reassured
the
frightened
women
and
explanations
followed
all
the
natives
of
the
vicinity
of
hamilton
inlet
had
been
wondering
what
had
become
of
us
and
blake
quickly
grasped
the
situation
kindness
itself
she
took
george
in
donald
and
gilbert
she
said
would
be
back
directly
she
made
him
hot
tea
and
put
on
the
table
for
him
some
grouse
stew
molasses
and
bread
and
butter
all
the
time
imploring
him
to
sit
down
and
warm
himself
but
george
was
too
excited
to
sit
down
up
and
down
he
paced
the
melting
ice
on
his
rags
making
tiny
rivulets
on
his
hostess
spotless
floor
most
of
the
breeds
who
live
near
the
western
end
of
hamilton
inlet
are
remarkably
cleanly
this
probably
being
due
to
their
scotch
blood
george
at
length
calmed
himself
sufficiently
to
turn
his
attention
to
the
meal
that
had
been
prepared
for
him
he
had
salt
for
his
meat
molasses
to
sweeten
his
tea
and
a
bountiful
supply
of
good
bread
he
ate
greedily
which
fact
he
soon
had
cause
to
regret
for
later
in
the
evening
he
began
to
bloat
and
for
several
days
thereafter
he
writhed
with
the
colic
but
for
the
present
he
thought
of
nothing
save
the
satisfaction
of
the
appetite
that
had
been
regenerated
by
the
food
he
had
been
able
to
obtain
after
leaving
me
it
was
especially
difficult
for
him
to
tear
himself
away
from
the
bread
as
there
must
be
an
end
to
all
things
however
george
eventually
stopped
eating
and
then
he
started
to
go
for
his
bag
but
blake
said
no
donald
get
he
sit
down
sir
and
rest
a
little
later
donald
and
gilbert
appeared
we
had
made
acquaintance
it
will
be
remembered
at
rigolet
it
was
he
who
had
sailed
his
boat
up
the
nascaupee
and
had
given
us
the
most
information
about
that
river
when
he
had
heard
george
story
there
was
no
need
to
urge
him
to
make
haste
lithe
ambitious
and
in
the
habit
of
doing
a
dozen
things
at
a
time
donald
was
activity
itself
his
brother
gilbert
a
young
fellow
of
seventeen
commonly
called
bert
was
also
eager
to
start
to
the
rescue
of
hubbard
and
me
they
told
george
it
was
fortunate
he
had
arrived
when
he
did
as
in
a
day
or
so
they
would
have
been
away
on
their
trapping
paths
but
did
you
see
allen
goudie
tilt
sir
asked
donald
when
george
had
finished
telling
about
his
trip
down
what
he
supposed
to
be
the
nascaupee
river
she
on
th
nascaupee
right
handy
to
th
bank
and
in
fair
sight
from
th
river
sir
if
there
a
tilt
on
the
nascaupee
said
george
you
can
kick
me
donald
asked
him
to
tell
more
about
the
river
we
were
on
and
george
drew
a
rough
map
of
its
leading
features
then
it
was
that
george
learned
that
the
river
of
our
distress
was
really
the
susan
and
we
passed
right
by
the
mouth
of
the
nascaupee
he
asked
he
was
informed
that
such
was
the
case
well
said
george
i
be
blamed
blamed
was
george
most
violent
expletive
i
never
heard
him
use
profanity
donald
told
george
he
must
not
think
of
going
back
with
the
rescuing
party
as
his
weakness
would
retard
its
progress
so
george
marked
on
the
map
he
had
made
of
the
susan
course
the
general
situation
of
our
last
camp
he
warned
donald
that
the
deep
snow
up
the
valley
might
have
prevented
me
from
reaching
the
tent
but
that
in
any
event
they
would
find
me
near
the
river
hearing
that
donald
quickly
decided
that
more
men
were
needed
for
the
rescuing
party
for
if
either
hubbard
or
i
was
found
alone
the
party
would
have
to
separate
in
order
to
continue
the
search
for
the
other
man
the
packs
besides
would
be
too
heavy
for
two
men
to
carry
and
make
the
rapid
progress
that
was
necessary
fortunately
allen
goudie
and
a
young
fellow
named
duncan
mclean
were
at
the
former
winter
tilt
on
the
nascaupee
seven
miles
across
the
lake
from
donald
the
hour
was
late
and
the
lake
was
rough
but
donald
and
gilbert
started
for
them
in
their
rowboat
immediately
after
making
ready
their
packs
of
provisions
and
camp
equipment
prepared
for
an
early
start
up
the
susan
the
next
day
at
noon
october
they
were
back
with
both
allen
and
duncan
and
at
once
loaded
the
packs
into
the
boat
then
the
four
men
rowed
up
through
the
little
lake
to
the
first
rapid
on
the
susan
hauled
the
boat
up
on
the
shore
donned
their
snowshoes
shouldered
their
packs
and
started
up
the
valley
running
when
they
could
which
the
rough
country
would
not
permit
of
their
doing
often
they
camped
at
night
ten
miles
above
their
boat
the
next
morning
october
they
cached
some
provisions
to
lighten
their
packs
and
as
they
proceeded
fired
a
rifle
at
intervals
thinking
there
was
now
a
chance
of
coming
upon
either
hubbard
or
me
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
must
have
passed
me
towards
evening
they
were
on
the
north
side
of
the
river
and
it
was
the
evening
when
i
staggered
down
the
north
shore
to
cross
the
ice
at
dusk
and
make
my
last
bivouac
in
the
lee
of
a
bank
on
the
south
shore
whether
i
had
crossed
the
river
before
they
came
along
or
whether
hidden
by
the
trees
and
the
falling
snow
i
passed
them
unobserved
on
the
same
shore
i
do
not
know
the
fact
is
they
camped
that
night
about
a
mile
and
a
half
above
me
and
about
twelve
miles
below
hubbard
tent
there
was
only
one
thing
that
saved
me
from
being
left
alone
to
die
these
trappers
keen
sense
of
smell
in
the
morning
october
while
they
were
breaking
camp
preparatory
to
continuing
on
up
the
valley
donald
blake
fancied
that
he
smelled
smoke
he
spoke
to
allen
goudie
about
it
and
both
men
stood
and
sniffed
the
air
yes
allen
smelled
smoke
too
it
was
unmistakable
the
wind
was
blowing
up
the
valley
therefore
someone
must
have
a
fire
below
them
hastily
finishing
the
work
of
breaking
camp
the
four
men
shouldered
their
packs
and
turned
back
close
down
to
the
shore
of
the
river
they
scrambled
and
hurried
on
shouting
and
discharging
a
rifle
at
length
they
paused
to
give
exclamations
of
satisfaction
they
had
found
my
track
leading
across
the
ice
to
the
other
shore
only
a
moment
they
paused
and
then
following
the
trail
they
broke
into
a
run
redoubling
their
shouts
and
repeatedly
discharging
the
rifle
they
had
smelled
my
smouldering
rotten
stump
but
if
a
whiff
of
smoke
was
now
rising
it
was
too
small
for
them
to
see
my
trail
however
led
them
to
the
bank
over
which
they
heard
my
feeble
answering
shout
so
down
the
bank
they
scrambled
to
come
to
a
sudden
halt
transfixed
with
amazement
as
they
told
me
afterwards
that
such
a
wreck
as
i
could
stand
and
live
the
spectacle
i
presented
certainly
must
have
been
an
unusual
one
a
man
all
skin
and
bones
standing
in
drawers
and
stocking
feet
with
the
remnants
of
a
pair
of
trousers
about
his
hips
there
in
the
midst
of
the
forest
they
were
heavily
clad
and
had
their
caps
pulled
far
down
over
their
ears
to
protect
them
from
the
biting
wind
while
i
did
not
even
have
my
hat
on
it
was
some
time
before
i
could
realise
that
living
men
were
before
me
as
if
in
a
i
stood
stupidly
gazing
at
them
but
with
the
return
of
sensibility
i
recollected
that
george
had
gone
to
find
donald
blake
and
gradually
it
dawned
upon
me
that
he
was
there
i
spoke
his
name
donald
blake
at
that
donald
stepped
forward
and
grasped
my
hand
warmly
and
firmly
like
an
old
friend
did
george
get
out
and
send
you
i
asked
yes
sir
it
was
he
that
sent
us
sir
he
safe
at
my
house
have
you
found
hubbard
not
yet
sir
we
smelled
smoke
a
mile
and
a
half
above
where
our
camp
was
last
night
an
came
down
to
find
you
sir
i
remember
telling
donald
that
he
had
better
leave
me
something
to
eat
and
go
on
to
hubbard
as
fast
as
he
could
he
replied
that
duncan
and
bert
the
two
young
fellows
would
stay
with
me
while
he
and
allen
would
continue
on
up
the
valley
during
this
talk
the
trappers
had
not
been
idle
while
two
of
them
cut
wood
for
a
rousing
fire
and
put
the
kettle
on
for
tea
the
others
made
a
cosey
couch
close
to
the
blaze
and
sat
me
on
it
they
gave
me
a
very
small
piece
of
bread
and
butter
you
better
eat
just
a
small
bit
at
first
sir
said
allen
fair
starved
and
much
grub
at
th
beginnin
might
be
th
worse
for
you
before
i
had
my
tea
donald
and
allen
were
ready
to
start
allen
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
asked
if
the
other
man
be
dead
sir
dead
i
said
oh
no
he
wo
be
dead
you
find
him
in
the
tent
waiting
for
you
but
if
he
be
dead
persisted
allen
he
may
be
and
we
sure
bring
th
body
out
now
sir
although
still
struggling
against
the
fear
that
my
reason
told
me
was
only
too
well
founded
i
requested
that
in
the
event
of
what
they
thought
possible
proving
to
be
the
case
they
wrap
the
body
in
the
blankets
they
would
find
in
the
tent
and
build
for
it
a
stage
high
enough
from
the
ground
to
protect
it
from
animals
i
also
asked
that
they
bring
back
with
them
all
the
things
they
should
find
in
the
tent
including
the
rifle
and
camera
and
especially
the
books
and
papers
of
all
descriptions
promising
that
all
should
be
done
as
i
wished
and
again
cautioning
me
against
eating
too
much
allen
and
donald
departed
leaving
me
a
prey
to
anxiety
and
fear
as
to
the
news
they
should
bring
back
xx
how
hubbard
went
to
sleep
a
pot
of
hot
tea
soon
was
ready
and
i
drank
some
of
it
i
hopes
you
feels
better
sir
then
spoke
young
duncan
maclean
a
smoke
taste
good
now
got
a
pipe
sir
i
produced
my
pipe
and
he
held
out
to
me
a
plug
of
tobacco
take
he
an
fill
th
pipe
sir
with
the
plug
in
my
possession
i
drew
my
to
cut
it
but
gilbert
blake
objected
he
a
big
un
sir
to
cut
tobacca
with
let
me
fill
he
sir
obediently
i
handed
him
my
pipe
to
be
filled
and
when
it
had
been
returned
to
me
one
of
the
boys
struck
a
match
and
held
it
to
the
bowl
while
i
puffed
then
duncan
took
the
plug
from
the
log
where
gilbert
had
left
it
and
holding
it
out
to
me
said
he
yours
sir
i
brought
he
for
you
an
added
duncan
impressively
there
more
when
he
gone
sir
the
tea
and
the
great
leaping
blaze
warmed
me
the
tobacco
stimulated
me
and
my
tongue
was
loosed
i
talked
and
i
talked
it
was
good
to
have
human
society
and
human
sympathy
again
the
boys
told
me
how
george
had
finally
reached
them
after
his
struggles
and
what
news
of
the
world
they
had
heard
after
a
little
they
gave
me
a
bit
more
bread
and
told
me
i
had
better
sleep
while
they
built
a
break
to
keep
the
wind
which
had
shifted
to
the
west
from
my
couch
and
while
watching
them
fell
trees
for
the
and
vaguely
wondering
whether
i
should
ever
be
strong
and
able
to
move
about
like
that
again
i
did
go
to
sleep
when
after
an
hour
had
passed
i
awoke
the
boys
made
me
drink
more
tea
and
eat
another
piece
of
bread
then
duncan
took
his
rifle
and
remarking
the
deer
signs
right
handy
an
a
bit
o
deer
meat
might
do
you
good
sir
strode
off
into
the
bush
late
in
the
afternoon
he
returned
without
having
been
rewarded
in
his
hunt
and
took
a
seat
with
gilbert
near
my
feet
as
i
reclined
on
the
boughs
twilight
came
and
then
darkness
and
i
lying
before
the
crackling
flames
wondered
as
they
burned
ever
brighter
whether
donald
and
allen
had
yet
found
hubbard
and
hoped
against
hope
that
they
had
found
him
alive
instinctively
i
felt
that
i
should
prepare
for
the
worst
but
i
cudgelled
my
brain
for
specious
arguments
to
make
myself
believe
he
had
survived
and
went
on
hoping
my
feet
had
been
paining
me
all
day
i
tried
to
take
off
my
socks
but
blood
clots
held
them
fast
to
the
raw
flesh
the
fact
was
they
had
been
frozen
it
was
hardly
to
be
wondered
at
the
wonder
was
how
i
wandering
for
ten
days
in
a
bitter
snowstorm
almost
naked
as
to
my
lower
extremities
escaped
with
my
life
under
ordinary
circumstances
a
physician
has
told
me
the
exposure
would
have
killed
me
in
short
order
but
having
been
living
in
the
open
for
months
i
had
become
gradually
inured
to
the
cold
and
the
effect
of
the
exposure
was
thus
greatly
mitigated
there
were
only
two
or
three
nights
on
the
entire
trip
when
any
of
us
went
to
bed
with
dry
feet
and
that
none
of
us
ever
had
the
slightest
symptom
of
a
cold
certainly
speaks
volumes
for
an
life
although
i
ate
very
sparingly
on
the
day
the
trappers
found
me
i
soon
began
to
suffer
greatly
from
bloating
and
nausea
in
the
night
i
was
very
ill
the
boys
did
everything
they
could
for
me
they
were
excellent
nurses
those
rough
brown
fellows
of
the
forest
anticipating
my
every
wish
when
once
or
twice
in
the
night
i
tried
to
walk
a
few
steps
from
the
fire
to
relieve
my
nausea
their
faces
and
actions
showed
plainly
their
concern
that
i
might
not
stagger
into
the
fire
they
would
rise
to
stand
between
it
and
me
one
of
them
remained
awake
all
night
to
keep
the
fire
going
and
to
help
me
should
i
need
anything
the
sun
was
again
showing
itself
above
the
horizon
setting
the
expanse
of
fir
trees
and
snow
aglow
and
the
boys
having
placed
the
kettle
over
the
fire
for
breakfast
were
cutting
more
wood
when
donald
and
allen
suddenly
came
over
the
bank
as
they
had
done
on
the
morning
before
their
packs
were
as
large
as
ever
and
they
had
rifle
i
knew
at
once
that
the
worst
had
happened
his
wife
and
mother
like
lightning
the
thought
flashed
through
my
mind
a
dizziness
came
over
me
and
for
a
moment
i
could
not
breathe
donald
spoke
yesterday
evenin
we
found
th
tent
sir
he
were
fastened
up
tight
with
pins
on
th
inside
an
had
been
opened
since
th
snow
began
says
i
to
allen
sir
poor
man
dead
is
sure
he
dead
allen
he
opened
th
tent
for
i
had
no
heart
to
do
it
sir
and
there
th
poor
man
was
wrapped
all
up
in
th
blankets
as
if
sleepin
sir
but
he
were
dead
sir
dead
and
he
were
dead
for
a
long
time
so
there
was
nothin
to
do
but
to
wrap
th
poor
man
safe
in
th
things
that
were
there
an
bring
back
th
papers
an
other
things
sir
we
kept
silent
we
five
men
until
donald
added
we
saw
a
place
when
right
handy
to
th
tent
where
you
had
a
fire
by
a
brook
sir
yes
i
said
i
built
that
fire
so
that
really
was
the
brook
near
our
tent
th
mercy
of
god
sir
said
allen
that
you
did
know
poor
man
were
there
dead
you
would
ha
given
up
yourself
sir
having
a
superstitious
horror
of
the
dead
donald
would
not
touch
the
body
and
without
assistance
allen
had
been
unable
to
place
it
on
a
stage
as
i
wished
however
he
arranged
it
carefully
on
the
ground
where
he
assured
me
it
would
be
perfectly
safe
he
suggested
that
i
permit
them
to
bury
the
body
where
it
was
as
it
would
be
quite
impossible
to
transport
it
over
the
rough
country
for
weeks
to
come
or
until
grand
lake
had
frozen
solid
and
the
ice
on
the
susan
river
rapids
become
hard
enough
to
bear
the
weight
of
men
with
a
sled
both
donald
and
allen
were
willing
to
go
back
to
the
on
grand
lake
and
get
the
tools
necessary
for
digging
the
grave
but
it
would
be
bad
enough
for
me
to
return
home
without
hubbard
alive
and
i
felt
that
i
simply
must
get
the
body
out
and
take
it
with
me
and
although
the
trappers
could
not
understand
my
reasons
i
refused
to
consent
to
its
burial
in
the
wilderness
in
spite
of
their
superior
knowledge
of
the
country
and
the
weather
conditions
i
felt
that
the
body
could
be
taken
down
to
the
post
later
but
recognised
the
impracticability
if
not
impossibility
of
undertaking
the
task
immediately
when
donald
and
allen
turned
over
to
me
the
papers
they
had
found
in
the
tent
i
took
up
hubbard
diary
wondering
if
he
had
left
a
last
message
in
the
back
part
of
the
book
was
a
letter
to
his
mother
a
note
to
his
wife
the
evident
attempt
again
to
write
to
his
wife
and
the
letter
to
the
agent
at
missanabie
written
on
george
behalf
from
these
i
turned
hastily
to
the
diary
proper
yes
there
was
an
entry
written
on
the
day
george
and
i
had
left
him
and
this
is
what
i
read
sunday
october
alone
in
camp
junction
nascaupee
and
some
other
stream
estimated
overestimated
i
hope
distance
above
head
of
grand
lake
miles
for
two
days
past
we
have
travelled
down
our
old
trail
with
light
packs
we
left
a
bit
of
flour
wet
about
miles
below
here
miles
approx
below
that
about
a
pound
of
milk
powder
miles
below
that
about
pounds
of
lard
we
counted
on
all
these
to
help
us
out
in
our
effort
to
reach
the
head
of
grand
lake
where
we
hoped
to
find
skipper
tom
blake
trapping
camp
and
cache
on
thursday
as
stated
i
busted
friday
and
saturday
it
was
the
same
i
saw
it
was
probably
hopeless
for
me
to
try
to
go
farther
with
the
boys
so
we
counselled
last
night
and
decided
they
should
take
merely
half
a
blanket
each
socks
some
tea
tea
pail
cups
and
the
pistols
and
go
on
they
will
try
to
reach
the
flour
then
wallace
will
try
to
bring
a
little
and
come
back
to
me
george
will
go
on
to
the
milk
and
lard
and
to
skipper
blake
if
he
can
and
send
or
lead
help
to
us
i
want
to
say
here
that
they
are
two
of
the
very
best
bravest
and
grandest
men
i
ever
knew
and
if
i
die
it
will
not
be
because
they
did
not
put
forth
their
best
efforts
our
past
two
days
have
been
trying
ones
i
have
not
written
my
diary
because
so
very
weak
day
before
yesterday
we
caught
sight
of
a
caribou
but
it
was
on
our
lee
and
winding
us
got
away
before
a
shot
could
be
fired
yesterday
at
our
old
camp
we
found
the
end
we
had
cut
from
a
flour
bag
it
had
a
bit
of
flour
sticking
to
it
we
boiled
it
with
our
old
caribou
bones
and
it
strengthened
the
broth
a
little
we
also
found
a
can
of
mustard
we
had
thrown
away
mina
gave
it
to
me
as
we
were
coming
away
saying
she
had
no
use
for
it
and
it
might
be
good
for
plasters
here
i
sat
and
held
it
in
my
hand
a
long
time
thinking
how
it
came
from
congers
and
our
home
and
what
a
happy
home
it
was
and
what
a
dear
dear
girl
presided
then
i
took
a
bite
of
it
and
it
was
very
good
we
mixed
some
in
our
bone
soup
and
it
seemed
to
stimulate
us
we
had
a
bit
of
caribou
skin
in
that
same
pot
it
swelled
up
thick
and
was
very
good
last
night
i
fell
asleep
while
the
boys
were
reading
to
me
this
morning
i
was
very
very
sleepy
after
the
boys
left
they
left
me
tea
the
caribou
bones
and
another
end
of
a
flour
sack
found
here
a
rawhide
caribou
moccasin
and
some
yeast
cakes
i
drank
a
cup
of
strong
tea
and
some
bone
broth
i
also
ate
some
of
the
really
delicious
rawhide
boiled
with
bones
and
it
made
me
stronger
strong
to
write
this
the
boys
have
only
tea
and
pound
of
pea
meal
our
parting
was
most
affecting
i
did
not
feel
so
bad
george
said
lord
help
us
hubbard
with
his
help
i
save
you
if
i
can
get
out
then
he
cried
so
did
wallace
wallace
stooped
and
kissed
my
cheek
with
his
poor
sunken
bearded
lips
several
times
and
i
kissed
his
george
did
the
same
and
i
kissed
his
cheek
then
they
went
away
god
bless
and
help
them
i
am
not
so
greatly
in
doubt
as
to
the
outcome
i
believe
they
will
reach
the
flour
and
be
strengthened
that
wallace
will
reach
me
that
george
will
find
blake
cache
and
camp
and
send
help
so
i
believe
we
will
all
get
out
my
tent
is
pitched
in
style
in
front
of
a
big
rock
the
rock
reflects
the
fire
but
now
it
is
going
out
because
of
the
rain
i
think
i
shall
let
it
go
and
close
the
tent
till
rain
is
over
thus
keeping
out
wind
and
saving
wood
or
perhaps
the
weather
will
improve
so
i
can
build
fire
eat
the
rest
of
my
moccasins
and
have
some
more
bone
broth
then
i
can
boil
my
belt
and
moccasins
and
a
pair
of
cowhide
mittens
they
ought
to
help
some
i
am
not
suffering
the
acute
pangs
of
hunger
have
given
way
to
indifference
i
sleepy
i
think
death
from
starvation
is
not
so
bad
but
let
no
one
suppose
i
expect
it
i
am
prepared
that
is
all
i
think
the
boys
will
be
able
with
the
lord
help
to
save
me
bravo
hubbard
nothing
could
down
your
spirit
for
long
could
there
so
high
was
your
spirit
that
you
could
not
know
it
was
impossible
for
your
poor
old
body
to
hold
it
any
longer
your
hand
was
firm
when
you
wrote
speaking
eloquently
of
that
which
most
of
all
was
you
it
is
a
man
game
you
said
one
day
in
referring
to
our
desperate
struggle
to
reach
those
we
loved
well
you
played
it
to
the
limit
and
it
was
a
man
death
my
friend
i
am
proud
of
you
putting
down
the
coverless
book
in
which
hubbard
brave
last
words
had
been
written
i
sat
and
thought
the
tea
the
bones
and
the
other
things
we
had
left
with
him
had
been
found
in
the
tent
with
the
body
the
tent
was
closed
as
he
said
he
was
going
to
close
it
and
the
snow
which
began
to
fall
that
sunday
night
had
not
been
disturbed
he
had
been
found
well
wrapped
in
the
blankets
as
if
sleeping
yes
it
was
quite
evident
that
after
making
that
last
entry
in
his
diary
on
the
day
we
left
him
he
had
lain
down
and
there
all
alone
amid
the
solitudes
of
desolate
labrador
there
in
the
wild
that
had
called
to
him
with
a
voice
to
which
he
must
needs
harken
had
gone
to
sleep
and
sleeping
had
not
awakened
xxi
from
out
the
wild
donald
and
allen
returned
at
once
to
the
log
house
on
grand
lake
leaving
with
the
boys
and
me
their
tent
and
donald
also
gave
me
a
pair
of
high
sealskin
boots
with
large
soft
moccasin
bottoms
it
was
their
expectation
that
we
should
remain
in
camp
until
they
got
back
with
other
things
to
aid
my
journey
out
but
although
i
was
still
very
ill
and
the
heated
tent
was
comfortable
i
found
waiting
irksome
and
at
daylight
the
next
morning
sunday
november
the
boys
and
i
pulled
up
stakes
to
protect
my
hands
during
the
journey
i
made
a
pair
of
mittens
from
a
piece
of
blanket
duffel
that
had
been
brought
back
from
the
tent
where
hubbard
was
a
pretty
good
path
had
been
trodden
in
the
snow
by
the
trips
of
my
rescuers
up
and
down
the
valley
and
following
along
it
with
duncan
and
gilbert
on
their
snowshoes
ahead
of
me
packing
it
down
still
further
i
did
not
sink
very
deeply
nevertheless
such
was
the
condition
of
my
feet
that
every
step
i
took
was
painful
as
the
boys
carried
all
that
was
to
be
carried
i
managed
however
to
walk
about
ten
miles
during
the
day
we
camped
at
a
place
where
the
four
trappers
on
their
journey
in
had
cached
a
fat
porcupine
for
supper
i
ate
a
bit
of
the
meat
and
drank
some
of
the
broth
and
found
it
very
nourishing
on
the
following
day
we
met
donald
and
allen
as
they
were
returning
to
aid
us
allen
brought
with
him
a
pair
of
trousers
to
cover
my
legs
at
sunset
we
reached
the
rowboat
which
had
been
left
near
the
mouth
of
the
susan
and
as
we
approached
donald
something
more
than
an
hour
later
a
rifle
was
fired
as
a
signal
that
we
were
coming
when
we
landed
george
was
there
on
the
starlit
shore
to
welcome
us
i
hardly
knew
him
his
hair
had
been
cut
he
had
shaved
off
his
ragged
beard
and
he
was
dressed
in
clean
clothing
that
donald
had
lent
him
he
of
course
had
heard
of
hubbard
death
from
donald
and
allen
and
when
he
clasped
my
hand
in
a
firm
grip
to
help
me
from
the
boat
he
said
well
wallace
hubbard
gone
yes
i
said
hubbard
gone
he
was
good
enough
to
say
he
was
glad
i
had
escaped
and
then
in
silence
we
followed
the
trail
up
to
the
house
the
first
human
habitation
i
had
seen
for
months
there
was
only
one
room
in
the
house
and
there
all
of
us
men
and
women
alike
slept
as
well
as
ate
but
it
was
scrupulously
clean
the
floor
table
chests
and
benches
had
been
scoured
until
they
shone
and
to
me
it
seemed
luxurious
the
family
did
everything
for
me
that
was
within
their
power
donald
gave
me
fresh
underclothes
and
his
wife
made
me
drink
some
tea
and
eat
some
rice
and
grouse
soup
before
i
lay
down
on
the
bed
of
skins
and
blankets
they
had
prepared
for
me
on
the
floor
by
the
stove
my
walk
had
completely
exhausted
me
and
i
had
a
severe
attack
of
colic
and
nausea
george
then
told
me
of
his
sufferings
blake
it
appeared
had
baked
a
batch
of
appetising
buns
and
george
not
profiting
by
his
experience
after
his
indiscretion
on
the
night
of
his
arrival
had
partaken
thereof
with
great
liberality
the
result
being
such
as
to
induce
the
reflection
have
i
escaped
and
starvin
only
to
die
of
the
women
of
the
household
slept
in
bunks
fastened
to
the
wall
and
while
they
prepared
themselves
for
their
night
rest
the
lamps
were
turned
low
and
we
men
discreetly
turned
our
backs
just
before
this
incident
we
had
family
worship
which
consisted
of
readings
from
the
bible
and
the
anglican
book
of
common
prayer
in
accordance
with
the
usual
custom
of
the
household
donald
our
host
professed
not
to
be
a
religious
man
but
never
a
day
passed
that
he
did
not
offer
thanks
to
his
maker
he
regularly
subscribed
of
his
income
to
the
support
of
the
methodist
mission
he
would
not
kill
a
deer
or
any
other
animal
on
sunday
if
it
came
right
up
to
his
door
his
whole
life
and
his
thoughts
were
decent
and
clean
and
he
was
ever
ready
to
abandon
his
work
and
go
to
the
rescue
of
those
who
needed
help
it
may
be
thought
strange
that
he
should
observe
the
forms
of
the
anglican
church
in
his
family
worship
and
subscribe
to
the
methodist
mission
the
explanation
is
that
denominations
cut
absolutely
no
figure
in
labrador
to
those
people
whose
blood
for
the
most
part
is
such
a
queer
mixture
of
scotch
eskimo
and
indian
there
is
only
one
church
the
church
of
jesus
christ
and
whenever
a
christian
missionary
comes
along
they
will
flock
from
miles
with
the
same
readiness
to
hear
him
whatever
division
of
the
church
may
claim
his
allegiance
so
accustomed
had
i
become
to
living
in
the
open
that
i
soon
found
the
atmosphere
of
the
closed
room
unendurable
and
several
times
during
the
night
i
had
to
go
out
to
breathe
i
was
down
on
the
shore
of
grand
lake
for
a
breath
of
the
crisp
winter
air
when
the
sun
rose
it
was
glorious
not
a
cloud
was
there
in
all
the
deep
blue
vault
of
the
heavens
and
as
the
sunbeams
peeked
over
cape
corbeau
the
lake
was
set
and
the
snow
on
the
surrounding
hills
radiated
tiny
shafts
of
fire
it
was
to
me
as
if
the
sun
were
rising
on
a
new
world
and
a
new
life
our
hardships
and
their
culminating
tragedy
seemed
to
belong
to
a
dim
and
distant
past
what
a
beautiful
world
it
was
after
all
and
how
i
thanked
god
that
i
lived
allen
goudie
had
offered
george
and
me
the
use
of
his
sailboat
in
returning
to
northwest
river
post
and
it
was
agreed
that
he
and
duncan
should
row
us
over
to
his
tilt
on
the
nascaupee
so
after
breakfast
george
and
i
said
to
donald
and
the
rest
of
his
household
and
three
hours
later
were
welcomed
by
allen
wife
again
we
received
every
attention
that
kindly
hearts
could
suggest
we
remained
at
allen
two
days
while
he
and
duncan
made
a
pair
of
oars
and
fitted
up
the
sailboat
for
our
trip
to
the
post
with
the
soap
and
warm
water
and
bandages
provided
by
goudie
i
was
able
to
dress
my
feet
one
foot
especially
had
been
affected
and
from
it
i
cut
with
a
jack
knife
much
gangrenescent
flesh
it
was
on
thursday
morning
november
that
george
and
i
warmly
dressed
in
donald
and
allen
clothes
set
sail
in
a
snowstorm
for
the
post
through
the
thin
ice
that
was
forming
in
the
river
upon
reaching
grand
lake
we
found
the
wind
adverse
and
the
snow
so
thick
we
could
not
see
our
course
but
after
we
had
hovered
about
a
fire
on
the
shore
until
well
into
the
afternoon
the
wind
shifted
to
the
west
and
the
storm
abated
enabling
us
to
proceed
a
little
farther
on
our
journey
or
until
signs
of
approaching
night
compelled
us
to
take
refuge
in
a
trapper
tilt
near
cape
blanc
on
the
southern
shore
this
was
the
tilt
that
george
in
his
struggle
out
had
supposed
he
would
have
to
reach
to
get
help
it
was
about
six
by
seven
feet
and
as
it
contained
a
we
were
able
to
make
ourselves
comfortable
for
the
night
after
our
supper
of
tea
and
bread
and
butter
and
molasses
thoughtfully
provided
by
goudie
the
next
morning
was
clear
and
beautiful
and
although
there
was
scarcely
wind
enough
to
fill
the
single
sail
of
our
little
craft
we
made
an
early
start
towards
noon
the
wind
freshened
and
soon
was
blowing
furiously
the
seas
ran
high
but
george
and
i
had
become
so
used
to
rough
weather
and
had
faced
danger
so
often
that
we
ran
right
on
in
front
of
the
gale
i
at
the
tiller
and
he
handling
the
sail
rope
and
bailing
the
water
out
when
occasionally
we
shipped
a
sea
the
rate
at
which
we
travelled
quickly
brought
us
to
the
rapid
at
the
eastern
end
of
the
lake
and
through
this
we
shot
down
into
the
little
lake
and
thence
through
the
strait
known
as
the
northwest
river
out
into
groswater
bay
it
was
about
in
the
afternoon
when
turning
sharply
in
below
the
post
wharf
we
surprised
mackenzie
the
agent
and
mark
blake
the
company
servant
in
the
act
of
sawing
wood
close
down
by
the
shore
that
they
were
astonished
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
the
boat
with
its
occupants
was
evident
they
dropped
their
crosscut
saw
and
stood
staring
in
a
moment
however
mackenzie
recognised
george
who
having
had
a
hair
cut
and
a
shave
looked
something
like
his
old
self
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
other
occupant
of
the
boat
must
be
i
he
came
quickly
forward
and
grasping
my
hand
as
i
stepped
from
the
boat
asked
abruptly
where
hubbard
dead
i
said
dead
of
starvation
eighty
miles
from
here
mark
blake
a
breed
but
not
related
to
donald
took
charge
of
george
and
as
mackenzie
and
i
walked
to
the
post
house
i
gave
him
a
brief
account
of
hubbard
death
and
my
rescue
he
had
been
warmly
attracted
to
hubbard
and
his
big
heart
was
touched
i
saw
him
hastily
brush
away
a
tear
taking
me
into
the
kitchen
he
instructed
his
little
housekeeper
lillie
blake
mark
niece
to
give
me
a
cup
of
cocoa
and
some
soda
biscuit
and
butter
while
he
made
a
fire
in
the
stove
lillie
cried
all
the
time
she
was
preparing
my
lunch
i
feels
so
sorry
for
you
sir
she
said
an
is
dreadful
th
poor
man
starvin
an
he
were
such
a
pretty
man
in
th
summer
i
says
before
you
went
t
th
bush
sir
he
sure
a
pretty
man
is
wonderful
sad
is
wonderful
sad
t
have
he
die
so
oh
that
pleasant
kitchen
with
the
floor
and
all
the
woodwork
scrubbed
white
and
the
rows
of
shining
utensils
on
the
shelves
and
the
comfort
of
the
great
stove
roaring
out
a
tune
to
us
on
that
frosty
winter
evening
as
i
sat
there
sipping
the
deliciously
rich
cocoa
mackenzie
joined
me
and
while
lillie
cooked
the
dinner
i
must
tell
him
over
and
over
again
my
story
and
in
spite
of
herself
the
little
housekeeper
would
cry
and
cry
the
dinner
which
consisted
of
grouse
potatoes
marmalade
bread
and
tea
was
served
in
the
dining
room
which
was
also
the
living
room
mackenzie
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
i
at
the
foot
and
on
a
lounge
to
one
side
sat
atikamish
a
small
mountaineer
indian
hunting
dog
gravely
alert
for
the
bones
his
master
would
occasionally
toss
to
him
atikamish
had
very
good
table
manners
he
caught
the
bones
neatly
and
deftly
and
he
invariably
chewed
them
up
without
leaving
his
seat
or
changing
his
position
my
appetite
was
returning
and
i
ate
well
but
it
was
fully
two
weeks
before
i
could
eat
without
experiencing
distress
later
when
that
blessed
time
arrived
i
never
could
get
enough
lillie
was
always
pressing
me
to
eat
and
for
a
time
i
had
at
least
six
meals
a
day
after
dinner
mackenzie
got
mark
blake
to
cut
my
hair
and
shave
off
my
beard
then
he
took
me
to
my
room
upstairs
where
a
stove
was
crackling
out
a
welcome
and
a
big
tub
of
warm
water
had
been
prepared
for
me
after
my
bath
he
again
came
up
to
rub
my
legs
which
were
much
swollen
from
frostbite
and
to
dress
my
foot
with
salve
in
a
suit
of
mackenzie
flannel
pajamas
i
then
went
to
my
soft
bed
and
lay
snug
and
warm
under
the
blankets
it
was
the
first
real
bed
i
had
lain
in
for
nearly
four
months
and
oh
the
luxury
of
it
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
express
the
gratitude
i
feel
towards
those
good
friends
they
nursed
me
with
the
tenderest
care
mackenzie
big
scotch
heart
and
the
woman
sympathetic
instinct
of
the
little
housekeeper
anticipated
my
every
want
and
he
and
she
never
could
seem
to
satisfy
themselves
with
doing
things
for
my
comfort
when
i
left
the
post
with
hubbard
i
weighed
pounds
a
week
after
my
return
i
weighed
but
with
the
care
they
took
of
me
my
general
health
was
soon
restored
and
i
rapidly
put
on
flesh
my
difficulties
however
were
not
yet
ended
hubbard
body
was
still
to
be
recovered
from
the
wild
and
repatriated
and
during
the
long
months
that
ensued
before
it
could
be
reached
i
lived
in
constant
dread
lest
it
should
be
destroyed
by
animals
until
at
length
the
dread
amounted
almost
to
an
obsession
moreover
the
gangrene
in
my
foot
became
worse
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
opportune
arrival
in
that
dreary
land
of
an
unfortunate
young
medical
student
it
in
all
likelihood
would
have
killed
me
xii
a
strange
funeral
procession
the
young
medical
student
was
george
albert
hardy
of
prince
edward
island
everybody
called
him
doctor
and
for
all
practical
purposes
he
was
a
regular
physician
and
surgeon
for
if
he
had
been
able
to
do
two
or
three
months
more
hospital
work
he
would
have
received
his
degree
the
reason
he
had
hastily
abandoned
his
studies
and
sought
professional
service
with
the
lumber
company
that
maintains
camps
at
the
western
end
of
the
hamilton
inlet
was
that
he
had
fallen
a
victim
to
consumption
he
arrived
at
northwest
river
post
on
november
on
a
small
schooner
that
brought
supplies
from
rigolet
for
mackenzie
and
the
muddy
lake
lumber
camp
at
the
mouth
of
the
grand
river
the
schooner
remained
only
an
hour
at
northwest
river
and
hardy
had
to
continue
on
to
muddy
lake
with
her
but
he
found
time
to
operate
on
my
left
foot
which
was
badly
affected
and
advise
me
how
to
continue
its
treatment
myself
the
doctor
said
that
the
mail
boat
the
virginia
lake
which
had
carried
him
to
rigolet
would
return
there
within
three
weeks
for
her
last
trip
to
newfoundland
of
the
season
and
he
urged
me
to
take
advantage
of
that
opportunity
to
go
home
and
get
proper
treatment
for
my
feet
the
temptation
was
great
but
i
felt
it
was
my
duty
not
to
leave
labrador
without
hubbard
body
it
was
my
plan
to
engage
dog
teams
and
start
with
the
body
for
the
coast
so
soon
as
it
could
be
brought
to
the
post
everybody
agreed
that
it
could
not
be
recovered
before
january
and
mackenzie
argued
strongly
against
the
practicability
of
transporting
it
with
dogs
suggesting
that
we
place
it
in
the
old
post
mission
chapel
until
navigation
opened
in
the
spring
when
it
could
be
sent
home
on
the
mail
steamer
but
i
knew
i
must
get
home
as
soon
as
possible
and
my
mind
was
made
up
to
take
the
body
with
me
if
i
had
to
haul
it
all
the
way
to
quebec
the
great
toe
on
my
left
foot
growing
steadily
worse
it
became
necessary
for
me
again
to
see
the
doctor
groswater
bay
and
goose
bay
by
this
time
were
frozen
solid
and
on
december
i
travelled
to
muddy
lake
where
hardy
was
stationed
by
dog
team
and
komatik
willie
ikey
an
eskimo
employed
by
monsieur
duclos
the
manager
of
the
french
trading
post
across
the
northwest
river
acting
as
my
driver
upon
my
arrival
i
was
cordially
welcomed
by
sidney
cruikshanks
the
lumber
boss
james
mclean
the
storekeeper
and
hardy
it
was
arranged
that
i
should
stop
and
sleep
with
the
doctor
at
house
the
doctor
did
some
more
cutting
and
under
his
careful
treatment
my
foot
so
improved
that
it
was
thought
i
could
with
safety
return
to
the
post
on
december
to
prepare
letters
and
telegrams
for
the
winter
mail
which
was
scheduled
to
leave
there
by
dog
team
for
quebec
on
the
it
was
the
before
the
mail
got
away
and
with
it
went
the
first
news
of
hubbard
death
to
reach
his
relatives
and
friends
my
dispatches
forwarded
from
chateau
bay
the
outpost
of
the
canadian
coast
telegraph
service
were
received
in
new
york
on
january
the
letters
two
months
later
immediately
upon
my
return
to
northwest
river
my
feet
began
to
trouble
me
again
word
was
sent
to
hardy
who
regarding
it
as
a
call
of
duty
arrived
on
december
i
very
much
regret
to
say
that
in
responding
to
the
call
hardy
received
a
chill
that
hastened
if
it
did
not
cause
his
death
after
examining
my
feet
upon
his
arrival
he
advised
me
to
return
with
him
to
muddy
lake
so
it
was
arranged
that
george
with
mackenzie
dogs
and
komatik
should
drive
hardy
and
me
to
the
kenemish
lumber
camp
twelve
miles
across
groswater
bay
where
there
was
a
patient
that
required
attention
and
that
from
there
hardy
and
i
should
go
on
to
muddy
lake
with
other
dogs
alas
the
doctor
never
saw
muddy
lake
again
before
starting
i
learned
from
allen
goudie
and
duncan
maclean
who
came
from
the
interior
to
spend
new
year
day
that
grand
lake
was
frozen
hard
and
an
attempt
might
be
made
to
bring
out
hubbard
body
accordingly
i
engaged
duncan
maclean
and
tom
blake
also
a
breed
to
undertake
the
task
with
george
and
to
recover
so
far
as
possible
the
photographic
films
and
other
articles
we
had
abandoned
at
goose
camp
and
lake
elson
blake
was
the
father
of
mackenzie
housekeeper
and
lived
at
the
rapid
at
the
eastern
end
of
grand
lake
as
he
had
at
the
request
of
friends
frequently
prepared
bodies
for
burial
it
was
arranged
that
he
should
head
the
expedition
while
george
acted
as
guide
and
the
agreement
was
that
weather
permitting
the
party
should
start
inland
on
january
a
coffin
made
by
the
carpenter
at
kenemish
was
all
ready
to
receive
the
body
when
it
should
arrive
at
the
post
george
was
to
have
driven
hardy
and
me
to
kenemish
on
january
but
as
there
was
a
stiff
wind
blowing
and
the
thermometer
registered
degrees
below
zero
we
postponed
our
departure
until
the
following
day
the
morning
was
clear
and
the
temperature
was
below
the
dogs
with
a
great
howling
and
jumping
had
hardly
settled
down
to
the
slow
trot
which
with
only
fair
travelling
is
their
habitual
gait
when
we
observed
that
the
sky
was
clouding
and
in
an
incredibly
short
time
the
first
snowflakes
of
the
gathering
storm
began
to
fall
soon
the
snow
was
so
thick
that
it
shut
us
in
as
with
a
curtain
and
eventually
even
old
aillik
our
leader
was
lost
to
view
bear
well
t
th
an
keep
free
o
th
bad
ice
the
sure
be
bad
ice
handy
t
th
kenemish
had
been
mark
blake
parting
injunction
so
george
kept
well
to
the
eastward
as
hour
after
hour
we
forged
our
way
on
through
the
bending
drifting
snow
at
length
we
came
upon
land
but
what
land
we
did
not
know
the
storm
had
abated
by
this
time
and
a
fresh
komatik
track
was
visible
which
we
proceeded
to
follow
on
all
sides
of
us
ice
was
piled
in
heaps
as
high
as
a
house
we
had
been
travelling
altogether
about
six
hours
and
the
storm
had
ceased
when
we
came
upon
a
tilt
on
the
shore
of
a
deep
bay
and
close
by
it
a
man
making
passes
with
a
stick
at
a
large
wolf
which
apparently
emboldened
by
hunger
was
jumping
and
snarling
about
waiting
for
a
chance
to
spring
in
upon
him
the
noise
of
our
approaching
komatik
caused
the
wolf
to
slink
off
and
then
the
man
hurried
to
the
tilt
reappeared
with
a
rifle
and
shot
the
beast
as
it
still
prowled
among
the
ice
hills
he
proved
to
be
uriah
white
a
trapper
not
at
all
excited
by
his
adventure
he
welcomed
us
to
his
tilt
in
throwing
off
his
mittens
to
fire
his
rifle
at
the
wolf
he
had
exposed
his
naked
hands
to
the
bitter
cold
and
they
had
been
while
thawing
out
his
hands
at
a
safe
distance
from
the
stove
he
informed
us
that
he
had
been
handy
to
he
meaning
the
wolf
to
see
that
he
were
a
she
the
condition
of
my
feet
had
not
permitted
me
to
leave
the
komatik
during
our
long
journey
and
i
suffered
severely
from
the
cold
george
and
alas
hardy
were
also
thoroughly
chilled
though
they
had
occasionally
exercised
themselves
by
running
behind
uriah
prepared
for
us
some
hot
tea
and
hardtack
and
gave
us
our
bearings
we
were
about
four
miles
east
of
kenemish
and
an
hour
later
we
arrived
there
the
lumber
camp
at
the
mouth
of
the
kenemish
river
is
composed
of
a
saw
mill
a
storehouse
in
which
also
live
the
native
helpers
a
cookhouse
a
part
of
which
is
given
over
to
lodgings
for
the
nova
scotian
lumbermen
and
a
log
stable
for
the
horses
that
do
the
general
work
about
the
camp
and
in
the
woods
hugh
dunbar
the
engineer
extended
a
warm
welcome
to
the
doctor
and
me
and
his
wife
who
did
the
camp
cooking
made
us
comfortable
in
the
cookhouse
i
was
destined
to
remain
at
the
camp
for
many
weeks
and
i
can
not
help
testifying
to
the
gratitude
i
feel
to
those
lumber
folk
especially
and
dunbar
wells
bently
the
storekeeper
tom
fig
the
machinist
and
archie

and
james

the
chill
he
had
received
during
the
trip
from
northwest

so
affected

that
he
was
unable
to
proceed
to
muddy
lake
two
days
after
our
arrival
he
had
a
severe
hemorrhage
and
the
following
day
another
they
forced
him
to
take
to
his
bed
and
thereafter
he
rose
only
occasionally
for
half
an
hour
rest
in
a
chair
he
was
a
deeply
religious
nature
and
realising
that
he
was
doomed
he
awaited
the
slow
approach
of
death
with
calm
resignation
and
my
feet
steadily
grew
worse
three
days
after
our
arrival
at
kenemish
i
could
not
touch
them
to
the
floor
the
doctor
and
i
lay
on
couches
side
by
side
i
could
not
even
bear
the
weight
of
the
on
my
feet
and
dunbar
built
a
rack
from
the
hoops
of
an
old
flour
barrel
to
protect
them
under
the
doctor
direction
dunbar
every
day
removed
the
bandages
from
my
feet
cleansed
them
with
carbolic
acid
water
and
rebandaged
them
dunbar
and
the
other
men
carried
me
in
their
arms
when
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
be
taken
from
my
couch
my
temperature
ran
up
until
it
reached
the
doctor
then
said
there
was
only
one
way
to
save
my
life
to
cut
off
my
legs
and
he
added
i
the
only
one
here
that
knows
how
to
do
it
and
i
too
weak
to
undertake
it
so
were
both
going
to
die
wallace
there
nothing
to
fear
in
that
though
if
you
trust
in
god
the
doctor
was
an
accomplished
player
of
the
violin
but
he
had
left
his
own
instrument
at
muddy
lake
and
the
only
one
he
could
obtain
at
kenemish
was
a
miserable
affair
that
gave
him
little
satisfaction
so
while
he
lay
dying
by
the
side
of
his
patient
who
he
thought
was
also
dying
he
for
the
most
part
gratified
his
love
of
music
and
sought
to
comfort
us
both
by
softly
singing
in
his
sympathetic
tenor
voice
the
grand
old
hymns
of
the
church
lead
kindly
light
and
nearer
my
god
to
thee
were
his
favourites
and
every
syllable
was
enunciated
clearly
and
distinctly
but
he
was
mistaken
in
thinking
that
i
too
was
to
die
soon
there
was
an
improvement
noticeable
in
the
condition
of
both
of
my
feet
and
gradually
they
grew
better
it
truly
a
miracle
that
the
lord
is
working
said
the
doctor
you
were
beyond
human
aid
i
prayed
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
that
you
get
well
i
prayed
a
dozen
times
a
day
and
now
the
prayer
is
answered
it
the
only
one
of
my
prayers
he
added
sadly
that
has
been
answered
since
i
have
been
in
labrador
during
january
and
february
the
cold
was
terrific
the
spirit
thermometer
at
the
camp
was
scaled
down
to
degrees
below
zero
and
on
several
days
the
spirit
disappeared
below
the
scale
mark
before
in
the
evening
for
a
week
the
temperature
never
even
at
midday
rose
above
below
the
old
natives
of
the
bay
said
there
never
had
been
such
a
winter
before
not
a
man
in
the
camp
escaped
without
a
frozen
nose
and
the
cheeks
and
chins
of
all
of
them
were
black
from
being
nipped
by
the
frost
bently
declared
that
he
froze
his
nose
in
bed
and
bently
bore
witness
to
the
truth
of
the
statement
but
bently
nose
was
frosted
on
an
average
of
once
a
day
nearly
all
of
this
time
i
lay
at
the
lumber
camp
worrying
about
hubbard
body
one
day
late
in
january
when
i
had
been
hoping
that
the
body
had
been
safely
brought
out
mackenzie
and
george
arrived
from
northwest
river
with
the
news
that
the
storms
had
been
so
continuous
it
had
not
been
deemed
wise
to
attempt
the
journey
inland
i
wished
to
be
removed
at
once
to
the
post
thinking
that
my
presence
there
might
hasten
matters
but
hardy
said
there
would
be
no
use
of
having
two
dead
men
and
i
was
forced
to
be
content
with
promises
that
the
expedition
would
get
under
way
as
soon
as
possible
early
in
february
the
doctor
said
i
might
try
my
feet
on
the
floor
the
result
was
the
discovery
that
my
knees
would
not
bear
me
and
that
i
should
have
to
learn
to
walk
all
over
again
recovering
the
use
of
my
legs
was
a
tedious
job
and
it
was
not
until
february
that
i
was
able
to
return
to
northwest
river
after
leaving
kenemish
i
never
saw
the
unfortunate
young
doctor
again
for
he
died
on
march
back
at
northwest
river
i
was
able
to
stir
things
up
a
bit
and
bright
and
early
on
tuesday
morning
march
george
tom
blake
and
duncan
maclean
composing
the
expedition
that
was
to
recover
hubbard
body
at
last
left
the
post
prepared
for
their
difficult
journey
into
the
interior
i
regretted
much
that
my
physical
condition
made
it
impossible
for
me
to
accompany
them
their
provisions
were
packed
on
an
indian
flat
sled
or
toboggan
and
their
tent
and
other
camp
equipment
on
a
sled
with
broad
flat
runners
that
i
had
obtained
especially
for
the
transportation
of
the
body
from
some
indians
that
visited
the
post
at
the
rapid
they
were
to
get
tom
blake
dogs
to
haul
their
loads
to
donald
blake
at
the
other
end
of
grand
lake
after
that
the
hauling
was
all
to
be
done
by
hand
as
it
is
quite
impossible
to
use
dogs
in
travelling
in
labrador
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
snow
squalls
developed
and
all
day
wednesday
and
thursday
the
snow
fell
heavily
i
knew
the
storm
would
interfere
with
the
progress
of
the
men
but
i
hoped
they
had
succeeded
in
reaching
donald
and
were
at
that
point
holding
themselves
in
readiness
to
proceed
what
was
my
disappointment
then
when
towards
noon
on
sunday
douglas
and
henry
blake
tom
two
young
sons
came
to
the
post
to
announce
that
their
father
was
at
home
he
had
made
a
start
up
grand
lake
they
said
but
the
storms
had
not
permitted
the
party
to
advance
any
farther
than
the
cape
corbeau
tilt
douglas
had
accompanied
the
men
to
cape
corbeau
which
point
it
had
taken
an
entire
day
to
reach
as
the
dogs
even
with
the
men
on
their
snowshoes
tramping
a
path
ahead
sank
so
deeply
in
the
snow
that
they
could
hardly
flounder
along
to
say
nothing
of
hauling
a
load
it
was
evident
therefore
that
the
dogs
would
retard
rather
than
accelerate
the
progress
of
the
party
on
grand
lake
and
when
the
cape
corbeau
tilt
was
reached
on
tuesday
night
it
was
decided
that
douglas
should
take
them
back
to
the
rapid
on
wednesday
morning
the
storm
was
raging
so
fiercely
that
it
was
considered
unsafe
to
go
ahead
for
the
present
george
moreover
complained
of
a
lame
ankle
and
said
he
required
a
rest
so
tom
came
to
the
conclusion
that
if
he
remained
at
the
tilt
he
would
be
eating
the
stock
of
grub
to
no
purpose
and
when
douglas
turned
homeward
with
the
dogs
he
went
with
him
george
and
duncan
were
to
stay
at
the
tilt
until
the
travelling
became
better
douglas
said
and
then
push
on
to
donald
and
wait
for
tom
there
douglas
story
made
it
plain
that
the
weather
conditions
on
grand
lake
had
been
fierce
enough
to
appal
any
man
but
as
there
had
been
no
snow
since
friday
night
i
could
not
understand
what
tom
was
doing
at
the
rapid
on
sunday
and
with
mackenzie
consent
i
had
mark
immediately
harness
the
post
dogs
and
drive
me
up
to
his
house
i
arrived
there
considerably
incensed
by
his
inactivity
but
i
must
say
that
his
explanation
was
adequate
he
asked
me
if
i
had
been
able
to
see
anything
of
grand
lake
and
made
me
realise
what
it
meant
to
be
out
there
with
a
high
west
wind
of
arctic
bitterness
drifting
the
snow
in
great
clouds
down
its
miles
of
unbroken
expanse
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
men
had
done
the
best
they
could
and
after
instructing
tom
that
if
more
provisions
were
needed
to
obtain
them
at
donald
at
my
expense
and
receiving
from
him
an
assurance
that
he
would
again
start
for
hubbard
body
as
soon
as
the
weather
would
permit
i
returned
mollified
to
the
post
it
was
on
this
day
sunday
march
that
i
received
my
first
news
from
home
and
the
outside
world
monsieur
duclos
who
had
been
on
a
trip
north
bringing
me
two
telegrams
from
new
york
they
conveyed
to
me
the
comforting
assurance
that
all
was
well
at
home
being
replies
to
the
dispatches
i
had
sent
in
december
received
at
chateau
bay
they
had
been
forwarded
to
me
three
hundred
and
fifty
miles
by
dog
teams
and
snowshoe
travellers
tom
blake
started
on
monday
morning
the
and
tuesday
at
noon
joined
george
and
duncan
at
donald
on
wednesday
the
three
men
began
their
march
up
the
susan
the
weather
continuing
fair
they
made
good
progress
and
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
the
site
of
our
last
camp
hubbard
body
with
the
tent
lying
flat
on
top
of
it
was
under
eight
feet
of
snow
near
the
spot
a
wolverine
had
been
prowling
but
the
body
was
too
deeply
buried
for
any
animal
to
scent
it
and
in
its
quiet
resting
place
it
lay
undisturbed
it
was
fortunate
that
it
had
not
been
placed
on
a
stage
as
i
had
suggested
for
in
that
event
it
would
undoubtedly
have
been
destroyed
continuing
on
inland
the
men
recovered
the
photographic
films
the
sextant
my
fishing
rod
and
other
odds
and
ends
we
had
dropped
on
the
trail
as
far
back
as
lake
elson
tom
and
duncan
praised
george
unstintingly
for
the
unvarying
accuracy
with
which
he
located
the
things
with
the
country
and
smaller
trees
buried
under
a
great
depth
of
snow
and
no
landmarks
to
guide
him
george
would
lead
the
other
men
on
and
with
no
searching
about
or
hesitancy
stop
and
say
we
dig
here
and
not
once
did
his
remarkable
instinct
play
him
false
is
sure
wonderful
said
tom
in
telling
me
about
it
i
could
ha
done
it
an
no
man
on
th
labrador
could
ha
done
it
sir
not
even
th
mountaineers
could
ha
done
it
and
duncan
seconded
tom
opinion
on
sunday
march
i
was
sitting
in
the
cosey
post
house
wondering
where
george
and
the
others
were
when
suddenly
george
appeared
from
out
the
snow
that
the
howling
gale
was
whirling
about
my
long
suspense
was
ended
the
body
had
been
recovered
in
good
condition
george
said
wrapped
in
the
blankets
that
hubbard
had
round
him
when
died
the
blankets
he
had
so
gaily
presented
me
with
that
june
morning
on
the
silvia
and
our
old
tarpaulin
which
george
had
recovered
farther
back
on
the
trail
it
had
been
dragged
on
the
indian
sled
forty
miles
down
over
the
sleeping
susan
river
and
thence
out
over
grand
lake
to
the
cape
corbeau
tilt
where
the
men
had
been
compelled
to
leave
it
the
day
before
owing
to
the
heavy
snowstorm
that
then
prevailed
from
the
tilt
the
men
had
gone
on
to
tom
house
at
the
rapid
to
spend
the
night
and
george
had
now
come
down
to
the
post
to
relieve
my
mind
with
the
news
that
the
body
was
safe
it
was
arranged
that
the
next
morning
george
and
duncan
should
take
the
post
dogs
and
komatik
drive
up
to
cape
corbeau
and
bring
the
body
down
the
morning
was
calm
and
fine
and
they
started
early
it
was
a
strange
funeral
procession
that
returned
the
sun
was
setting
when
on
their
way
back
with
the
body
lashed
to
the
komatik
they
passed
over
the
rapid
where
hubbard
that
beautiful
july
morning
had
sprung
vigorously
into
the
water
to
track
the
canoe
into
grand
lake
how
full
of
hope
and
pleasurable
anticipation
he
had
been
when
we
paddled
through
the
little
lake
over
the
snow
and
ice
that
now
hid
the
lake
the
seven
dogs
that
were
hauling
his
corpse
strained
and
tugged
ever
and
anon
breaking
into
a
trot
as
george
and
duncan
running
on
their
snowshoes
on
either
side
of
the
komatik
urged
them
forward
with
eskimo
exclamations
or
cracked
their
long
whip
over
a
laggard
no
need
to
urge
any
one
of
them
on
however
when
they
came
in
sight
of
the
post
darkness
was
falling
knowing
that
their
daily
meal
was
near
at
hand
the
dogs
broke
into
a
run
and
with
much
howling
and
jumping
swung
around
the
point
and
up
to
the
buildings
xxiii
over
the
ice
with
the
body
at
the
post
it
was
my
intention
to
hire
dog
teams
and
accompanied
by
george
start
with
it
at
once
for
home
travelling
up
hamilton
inlet
to
the
ocean
and
then
down
along
the
coast
to
battle
harbour
or
some
port
farther
south
where
we
might
happen
on
a
ship
that
would
take
us
away
from
the
land
where
we
had
suffered
so
much
more
than
three
weeks
elapsed
however
before
we
could
get
away
from
the
northwest
river
it
was
about
miles
over
the
ice
to
battle
harbour
and
mackenzie
and
the
others
continued
to
argue
against
the
feasibility
of
my
plan
for
a
time
it
did
seem
as
if
it
would
be
impossible
to
carry
it
out
first
of
all
i
had
trouble
with
coffin
when
we
received
the
body
the
plain
spruce
box
that
had
been
made
for
it
was
found
not
to
be
deep
enough
i
sent
over
a
request
to
james
greenan
the
carpenter
at
kenemish
that
another
one
be
made
as
speedily
as
possible
he
replied
that
the
last
board
they
had
on
hand
had
been
used
in
making
a
coffin
for
poor
hardy
but
said
that
if
i
would
return
to
him
the
coffin
we
had
he
believed
he
could
raise
the
sides
to
the
requisite
height
mackenzie
immediately
despatched
mark
with
the
dogs
and
komatik
to
carry
the
coffin
to
kenemish
and
on
april
it
was
returned
with
the
necessary
alterations
the
body
meanwhile
had
lain
wrapped
in
the
blankets
and
tarpaulin
in
a
storehouse
where
the
temperature
practically
was
as
low
as
it
was
out
of
doors
now
we
placed
it
in
the
box
with
salt
as
a
preservative
and
everything
was
ready
for
our
long
journey
then
arose
the
question
as
to
where
i
could
get
dogs
two
teams
were
needed
one
for
the
body
and
one
for
our
baggage
not
a
dog
owner
could
i
find
who
would
undertake
the
task
i
sent
imploring
messages
for
miles
around
but
all
to
no
purpose
they
would
not
even
undertake
the
journey
to
rigolet
some
i
knew
did
not
like
the
idea
of
travelling
with
a
corpse
and
others
like
tom
blake
did
not
have
enough
dogs
to
haul
our
loads
in
despair
i
went
to
monsieur
duclos
on
april
and
urged
him
to
lend
me
his
team
to
take
us
as
far
as
rigolet
telling
him
that
mackenzie
was
willing
to
let
us
have
his
team
for
the
trip
to
rigolet
but
that
another
was
needed
the
french
post
dogs
had
just
returned
from
a
long
journey
and
monsieur
duclos
said
they
were
not
fit
for
travel
but
finally
to
my
great
joy
he
very
kindly
consented
to
let
me
have
them
with
belfleur
a
as
driver
after
they
had
a
couple
of
rest
it
was
mackenzie
custom
to
make
an
annual
trip
to
rigolet
on
post
business
and
this
usually
took
place
in
may
but
he
expedited
his
arrangements
so
as
to
be
able
to
leave
with
us
and
thus
save
his
dogs
an
additional
journey
belfleur
arrived
with
his
dogs
early
on
the
morning
of
april
unfortunately
fred
blake
mackenzie
driver
was
not
on
hand
but
it
was
decided
that
belfleur
should
go
ahead
with
george
and
the
coffin
and
that
mackenzie
and
i
should
follow
with
the
baggage
the
next
morning
it
was
nine
when
the
eight
dogs
that
were
to
haul
the
two
men
and
the
coffin
got
under
way
all
the
natives
were
sorry
to
see
george
go
his
genial
manners
and
cheerful
grin
having
made
him
a
prime
favourite
mackenzie
little
housekeeper
and
mark
blake
wife
who
had
been
george
hostess
wept
copiously
mackenzie
fred
blake
and
i
got
off
at
six
the
next
morning
our
seven
big
dogs
were
howling
and
straining
on
the
long
traces
as
i
said
to
all
the
good
friends
that
had
been
so
kind
to
me
and
had
gathered
to
see
me
leave
it
took
us
until
evening
of
the
following
day
to
reach
rigolet
the
eskimo
dogs
almost
invariably
leave
a
house
and
arrive
at
one
with
a
great
flourish
but
between
times
they
settle
down
to
a
gentle
pace
and
have
to
be
urged
on
with
exclamations
and
much
snapping
of
the
whip
ours
were
much
better
travellers
than
those
belonging
to
the
french
post
and
despite
the
fact
that
they
had
a
heavier
load
to
haul
and
were
one
less
in
number
we
overtook
george
and
belfleur
on
the
afternoon
of
the
second
day
a
part
of
the
time
mackenzie
and
fred
ran
beside
the
komatik
on
their
snowshoes
to
get
warm
but
my
knees
were
still
so
weak
that
i
had
to
stick
to
the
komatik
all
the
way
we
spent
the
night
at
the
log
cabin
of
a
breed
and
before
noon
the
next
day
came
to
the
cabin
of
one
bell
shepard
where
we
learned
george
and
belfleur
had
spent
their
second
night
it
is
considered
a
gross
beach
of
etiquette
on
the
labrador
to
pass
a
man
house
without
stopping
for
bread
and
tea
and
so
we
had
to
turn
in
to
see
bell
as
he
served
us
with
refreshment
he
gave
us
a
startling
bit
of
news
to
wit
that
there
was
a
great
war
raging
in
the
outside
world
with
great
britain
the
united
states
and
japan
on
one
side
and
russia
france
and
germany
on
the
other
i
sure
is
true
sir
he
insisted
upon
observing
that
mackenzie
and
i
appeared
incredulous
i
just
come
frum
rigolet
an
scott
th
trader
had
th
word
by
th
telegraph
to
chateau
so
is
sure
true
sir
an
is
bad
word
for
us
poor
folk
on
th
labrador
with
prices
to
go
up
as
they
tells
me
they
sure
will
on
flour
an
pork
we
found
out
later
that
such
a
report
had
really
spread
up
the
coast
from
dog
driver
to
dog
driver
until
it
had
reached
rigolet
and
it
was
not
until
i
got
to
battle
harbour
that
i
learned
that
its
basis
was
the
beginning
of
the
conflict
between
russia
and
japan
at
rigolet
we
were
again
hospitably
received
by
fraser
the
factor
the
news
of
hubbard
death
had
preceded
us
in
fact
it
had
been
carried
up
and
down
the
coast
all
the
way
from
cape
charles
to
cape
chidley
awaiting
me
was
a
letter
from
cluny
macpherson
of
the
deep
sea
mission
at
battle
harbour
who
i
was
informed
had
recently
been
to
rigolet
and
had
hoped
to
see
me
the
letter
proved
to
contain
much
valuable
information
as
to
stopping
places
and
the
probabilities
of
getting
dogs
between
rigolet
and
battle
harbour
as
well
as
the
good
news
that
a
steamer
was
expected
at
battle
harbour
early
in
may
i
also
learned
from
fraser
that
whitney
editor
of
outing
magazine
of
which
hubbard
had
been
the
associate
editor
had
sent
a
message
to
the
telegraph
operator
at
chateau
bay
requesting
him
to
lend
me
every
assistance
possible
and
to
spare
no
expense
though
the
message
was
it
had
the
effect
of
increasing
my
difficulties
duly
exaggerated
and
embellished
it
had
spread
up
the
coast
until
every
dog
owner
gained
the
impression
that
a
little
gold
mine
was
about
to
pass
through
his
country
i
found
this
out
when
i
tried
to
get
dog
teams
to
carry
me
to
cartwright
post
the
next
stage
on
my
journey
a
haughty
person
named
jerry
flowers
it
appeared
had
a
monopoly
just
then
of
the
business
in
the
vicinity
of
rigolet
and
when
we
arrived
at
the
post
he
proceeded
to
deal
with
me
in
the
manner
common
to
trust
magnates
the
regular
rate
paid
by
traders
for
transportation
over
the
eighty
odd
miles
between
rigolet
and
cartwright
was
from
ten
to
twelve
dollars
a
team
but
for
the
two
teams
i
needed
jerry
expected
me
to
pay
him
sixty
dollars
while
i
was
still
arguing
with
the
immovable
jerry
john
williams
an
old
livyere
fortunately
arrived
from
west
bay
which
is
half
way
to
cartwright
and
fraser
used
his
influence
with
john
to
such
good
purpose
that
he
consented
to
take
us
with
his
dog
team
at
least
as
far
as
his
home
at
the
regular
rate
john
had
only
six
dogs
but
he
told
us
we
should
be
able
to
get
an
additional
team
at
william
mugford
two
miles
beyond
rigolet
the
strait
at
rigolet
was
open
and
when
late
in
the
afternoon
of
monday
april
we
bade
mackenzie
and
fraser
farewell
george
and
i
with
our
baggage
and
hubbard
body
were
taken
across
through
the
cakes
of
floating
ice
in
one
of
the
company
big
boats
manned
by
a
crew
of
brawny
post
servants
on
the
other
shore
we
loaded
the
baggage
and
coffin
on
john
komatik
and
with
him
driving
the
dogs
and
george
and
i
walking
behind
on
snowshoes
we
reached
mugford
at
dusk
there
we
stopped
for
the
night
being
served
with
the
meals
that
the
people
all
down
the
coast
usually
eat
at
that
time
of
the
year
bread
and
molasses
and
tea
with
one
or
two
exceptions
we
had
to
sleep
on
the
floor
at
the
places
where
we
stopped
for
the
houses
generally
contained
only
one
room
divided
by
a
partition
almost
all
of
the
houses
had
low
extensions
used
as
a
storage
place
and
there
hubbard
body
would
rest
over
night
never
did
we
pay
anything
for
our
entertainment
poor
as
the
people
are
they
would
be
greatly
offended
if
a
traveller
they
took
in
offered
them
money
generally
speaking
we
had
good
weather
for
our
long
journey
to
battle
harbour
and
pretty
fair
going
day
after
day
we
followed
the
coast
line
south
crossing
from
neck
of
land
to
neck
of
land
over
the
frozen
bays
and
inlets
sometimes
we
encountered
ridges
on
the
necks
of
land
and
then
we
would
have
to
help
the
dogs
haul
the
loads
to
the
top
resuming
our
places
on
the
komatiks
we
would
coast
down
the
slopes
with
the
dogs
racing
madly
ahead
to
keep
from
being
run
over
if
the
descent
was
very
steep
a
drag
in
the
form
of
a
hoop
of
braided
walrus
hide
would
be
thrown
over
the
front
of
one
of
the
komatik
runners
but
even
then
the
dogs
would
have
to
run
their
hardest
to
preserve
a
safe
distance
between
them
and
us
and
out
on
the
smooth
ice
of
the
bays
we
would
shoot
to
skim
along
with
exhilarating
swiftness
as
we
proceeded
south
we
were
interested
in
observing
signs
of
spring
towards
the
end
of
our
journey
we
encountered
much
soft
snow
and
ice
mugford
agreed
to
help
us
out
with
his
four
dogs
as
far
as
west
bay
arriving
there
we
found
that
only
one
team
was
procurable
for
the
rest
of
the
trip
to
cartwright
so
john
williams
continued
on
with
us
all
the
way
forty
or
fifty
miles
a
day
is
about
all
that
dogs
can
be
expected
to
accomplish
with
average
going
and
we
spent
two
days
between
rigolet
and
cartwright
reaching
the
hudson
bay
company
post
at
sandwich
bay
on
the
evening
of
wednesday
april
to
receive
kindly
welcome
from
the
agent
swaffield
again
at
cartwright
we
had
some
difficulty
in
getting
dogs
and
it
was
not
until
friday
morning
that
we
could
push
on
these
delays
were
exasperating
for
i
was
bent
on
catching
the
steamer
that
macpherson
informed
me
in
his
letter
was
due
at
battle
harbour
early
in
may
our
journey
resumed
it
was
a
case
of
fighting
dog
owners
all
the
way
seal
islands
about
ninety
miles
farther
down
the
coast
we
reached
on
saturday
night
april
there
we
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
entertained
by
a
quaint
character
in
the
person
of
skipper
george
morris
a
native
trader
he
had
been
expecting
us
and
he
greeted
me
as
if
i
had
been
his
brother
dear
eyes
he
exclaimed
wringing
my
hand
in
his
bluff
cordial
way
dear
eyes
but
glad
to
see
you
wonderful
glad
the
skipper
house
was
far
above
the
average
of
those
on
the
coast
it
had
two
floors
with
two
rooms
each
and
his
good
wife
kept
everything
clean
and
bright
soon
after
our
arrival
the
skipper
got
out
for
our
edification
two
shotguns
one
single
and
the
other
each
of
which
was
fully
six
feet
long
from
butt
to
muzzle
and
had
a
bore
of
one
and
inches
th
boers
ha
been
fightin
england
said
he
an
i
got
un
the
gun
t
fight
sir
dear
eyes
if
th
boers
ha
come
handy
t
us
i
thinks
i
could
ha
kept
un
off
sir
i
knows
i
could
wi
them
guns
i
sure
ha
shot
through
their
schooners
sir
if
un
was
big
as
th
mail
boat
an
steamers
like
th
mail
boat
i
ha
shot
through
un
sir
an
mail
boat
a
big
un
sir
as
you
knows
the
next
day
was
may
day
i
knew
that
at
home
the
birds
and
the
flowers
had
returned
and
that
in
dear
old
new
york
gay
parties
of
children
were
probably
marching
to
the
parks
what
a
may
day
it
was
on
the
labrador
the
morning
ushered
in
a
heavy
snow
storm
with
a
tremendous
gale
thinking
of
the
steamer
due
at
battle
harbour
i
suggested
that
despite
the
storm
we
might
make
a
start
but
the
skipper
exclaimed
dear
eyes
an
start
in
this
gale
no
no
th
dogs
could
face
un
sir
and
as
george
and
our
drivers
thought
likewise
we
spent
the
day
resting
with
the
old
skipper
and
his
wife
warmly
housed
and
faring
sumptuously
on
wild
duck
while
the
storm
outside
seemed
to
shake
the
world
to
its
very
foundations
on
may
the
snow
had
almost
ceased
falling
and
the
wind
had
somewhat
subsided
when
at
eleven
we
parted
from
the
quaint
old
skipper
whose
dear
eyes
continued
to
lend
emphasis
to
his
remarks
up
to
the
last
that
we
saw
of
him
rounding
a
point
of
land
soon
after
leaving
seal
islands
we
came
suddenly
upon
two
runaway
dogs
from
a
team
that
had
been
stormbound
at
seal
islands
like
ourselves
the
runaways
were
thoroughly
startled
by
our
sudden
appearance
and
took
to
their
heels
with
our
teams
composed
respectively
of
ten
dogs
and
twelve
dogs
after
them
the
ice
we
were
on
had
been
swept
clear
of
snow
by
the
wind
the
hauling
was
easy
and
our
dogs
almost
flattened
themselves
out
in
their
effort
to
get
at
the
strangers
and
chew
them
up
the
pace
became
terrific
but
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
hold
on
tight
and
trust
to
luck
for
perhaps
five
miles
our
wild
ride
lasted
and
then
the
strange
dogs
turning
to
the
land
our
teams
abandoned
the
race
and
condescended
to
pay
some
heed
to
their
masters
excited
observations
fortunately
the
chase
had
carried
us
in
the
direction
for
which
we
were
bound
early
in
the
afternoon
we
reached
a
cache
of
cod
heads
and
stopped
while
the
dogs
were
fed
one
each
poor
brutes
they
had
had
nothing
to
eat
since
friday
night
this
was
monday
and
i
imagine
a
rather
scant
meal
even
then
for
at
this
time
of
the
year
the
stock
of
salt
seal
meat
and
fat
and
dried
cod
heads
and
caplin
that
the
natives
put
up
in
the
summer
and
fall
for
dog
food
is
nearly
exhausted
and
what
remains
is
used
very
economically
often
the
dogs
receive
only
one
scanty
meal
every
other
day
our
drivers
had
intended
to
feed
their
teams
at
seal
islands
but
on
account
of
the
scarcity
of
dog
food
none
could
be
purchased
at
four
in
the
afternoon
we
reached
norman
bay
where
we
found
a
miserable
hut
unoccupied
save
by
an
abundance
of
filth
two
cats
and
one
hen
as
there
were
no
tracks
visible
in
the
snow
the
people
evidently
had
been
away
since
the
storm
began
on
saturday
night
we
built
a
fire
in
the
stove
made
tea
and
fed
ourselves
the
cats
and
the
hen
from
our
grub
bag
i
invariably
insisted
that
our
drivers
travel
as
long
as
there
was
light
which
at
this
season
lasted
until
after
eight
and
we
pushed
on
until
we
came
to
corbett
bite
a
place
that
also
rejoices
in
the
name
of
new
york
the
same
having
been
facetiously
bestowed
upon
it
by
some
fisherman
wag
because
four
small
huts
had
been
collected
there
to
make
a
city
the
inhabitants
of
new
york
had
all
moved
to
their
fishing
quarters
farther
out
on
the
coast
when
we
arrived
and
we
took
possession
for
the
night
of
the
best
of
the
huts
filth
and
slush
lay
an
inch
deep
on
the
floor
of
the
single
room
a
hole
in
the
roof
provided
a
means
of
escape
for
the
smoke
from
the
fire
we
built
in
an
improvised
fireplace
and
at
the
same
time
a
constant
source
of
fear
on
our
part
lest
some
of
the
dogs
which
roamed
at
will
over
the
roof
fall
through
it
and
into
our
fire
an
old
bench
and
loose
boards
taken
from
a
in
the
room
served
as
beds
for
our
party
and
we
passed
a
fairly
comfortable
night
we
were
off
at
daylight
and
at
eight
that
morning
may
reached
williams
harbour
where
i
had
hoped
to
engage
the
teams
of
john
and
james
russell
and
proceed
immediately
to
battle
harbour
which
place
was
now
only
a
few
miles
off
but
the
russells
were
away
and
did
not
return
until
night
so
that
we
were
unable
to
proceed
until
the
following
morning
with
their
teams
of
eight
and
six
dogs
the
russells
got
us
away
early
however
and
at
eleven
that
morning
may
we
arrived
at
fox
harbour
eight
miles
across
the
bay
from
battle
harbour
now
a
new
problem
presented
itself
which
was
all
the
more
exasperating
for
the
reason
that
we
were
in
sight
of
our
goal
the
ice
pack
was
in
the
bay
and
it
was
quite
impossible
to
cross
it
until
the
wind
might
shift
and
blow
the
pack
out
it
is
true
that
by
a
tortuous
trail
some
thirty
miles
around
we
could
with
dogs
reach
cape
charles
just
below
battle
harbour
but
none
of
the
few
drivers
that
knew
the
trail
was
anxious
to
undertake
the
journey
and
as
the
probabilities
were
that
even
if
we
did
succeed
in
reaching
cape
charles
we
should
be
in
the
same
fix
there
as
where
we
were
our
only
course
seemed
to
be
to
remain
at
fox
harbour
and
wait
no
vessel
they
told
us
had
yet
arrived
either
at
battle
harbour
or
cape
charles
george
wakeham
an
old
english
fisherman
from
devonshire
who
had
spent
forty
years
of
his
life
on
the
labrador
and
had
an
eskimo
wife
welcomed
us
to
his
house
near
it
was
an
eminence
called
watch
hill
from
which
the
general
situation
of
the
ice
pack
could
be
observed
day
after
day
i
climbed
watch
hill
and
for
hours
at
a
time
with
a
telescope
viewed
the
ice
and
gazed
longingly
at
battle
harbour
in
the
distance
on
the
morning
of
the
ninth
day
the
pack
appeared
to
be
spreading
and
i
decided
to
run
the
risk
of
getting
fast
in
the
ice
and
make
at
least
an
attempt
to
start
so
george
and
i
and
the
five
natives
that
were
to
row
us
over
got
the
boat
afloat
prepared
for
a
start
immediately
after
luncheon
meanwhile
george
and
i
ascended
watch
hill
for
another
look
at
the
ice
pack
upon
scanning
the
distant
shore
line
through
the
telescope
we
discovered
a
speck
moving
in
the
bay
away
over
near
battle
harbour
a
little
later
we
were
assured
that
it
was
a
big
laboriously
making
its
way
through
the
ice
it
came
nearer
and
nearer
obviously
headed
for
fox
harbour
at
noon
it
arrived
and
its
brawny
crew
of
fishermen
said
they
had
come
for
us
macpherson
had
sent
them
the
steamer
that
the
doctor
had
written
me
was
expected
had
arrived
at
cape
charles
with
a
cargo
for
a
new
whale
factory
and
probably
would
sail
for
newfoundland
the
next
day
having
heard
we
were
on
our
way
down
the
coast
and
divining
that
we
were
held
at
fox
harbour
by
the
ice
macpherson
had
sent
the
boat
so
that
we
might
be
sure
to
get
the
steamer
i
marvelled
greatly
at
these
evidences
of
the
thoughtfulness
for
us
who
were
absolute
strangers
to
him
and
was
deeply
touched
we
placed
the
coffin
in
the
boat
together
with
our
baggage
and
started
at
once
the
men
had
instructions
to
take
us
directly
to
the
ship
as
she
lay
off
cape
charles
and
after
a
row
of
about
thirteen
miles
we
reached
her
at
five
in
the
afternoon
she
was
the
aurora
one
of
the
newfoundland
sealing
fleet
it
was
like
reaching
home
to
be
on
shipboard
again
and
i
felt
that
my
troubles
were
ended
the
mate
patrick
dumphry
informed
me
however
that
her
commander
captain
abraham
kean
was
at
battle
harbour
and
that
the
steamer
would
not
sail
before
the
following
night
so
wishing
to
have
coffin
prepared
for
the
voyage
and
to
meet
and
thank
macpherson
i
had
the
men
row
me
back
the
five
miles
to
battle
harbour
there
i
learned
that
upon
receiving
the
first
news
of
my
proposed
attempt
to
bring
out
hubbard
body
macpherson
had
made
a
special
trip
of
miles
to
chateau
bay
to
telegraph
to
new
york
suggesting
that
arrangements
be
made
with
bowering
the
owners
of
the
aurora
to
have
that
steamer
pick
us
up
at
battle
harbour
perhaps
i
should
say
here
that
the
kindness
of
the
doctor
to
us
was
only
what
might
have
been
expected
from
a
gentleman
by
birth
and
breeding
who
with
his
charming
wife
buries
himself
on
the
desolate
coast
of
labrador
in
order
to
do
his
master
work
pitiable
indeed
would
be
the
condition
of
the
poor
folk
on
the
labrador
were
it
not
for
grenfell
and
his
brave
of
the
deep
sea
mission
for
hundreds
of
miles
along
the
coast
they
travel
on
their
errands
of
mercy
braving
the
violent
storms
of
the
bitter
arctic
winter
sleeping
in
the
meanest
of
huts
and
frequently
risking
their
lives
in
open
boats
on
the
raging
sea
many
is
the
needy
one
for
whom
they
have
found
work
many
is
the
stricken
soul
that
they
have
comforted
and
many
is
the
life
that
their
medical
skill
has
saved
at
the
doctor
house
i
received
my
first
letters
from
home
and
the
first
accurate
news
of
what
had
been
transpiring
in
the
outside
world
while
there
i
also
met
captain
kean
unfortunately
the
people
in
new
york
had
not
made
the
arrangement
macpherson
had
suggested
but
the
captain
assumed
the
responsibility
of
carrying
us
to
newfoundland
saying
that
we
should
go
as
his
guests
he
is
a
former
member
of
the
newfoundland
parliament
and
a
man
of
influence
as
well
as
initiative
and
it
was
lucky
for
us
that
he
commanded
the
aurora
else
we
in
all
probability
should
have
had
to
push
farther
down
the
coast
with
dogs
or
waited
at
battle
harbour
for
the
first
appearance
of
the
mail
boat
the
next
day
friday
may
a
firm
of
traders
at
battle
harbour
under
macpherson
supervision
lined
hubbard
coffin
with
sheet
lead
and
sealed
it
hermetically
the
body
was
still
frozen
and
in
good
condition
in
the
afternoon
we
were
taken
to
the
aurora
by
macpherson
and
a
crew
of
his
men
and
established
in
the
cabin
while
hubbard
coffin
was
carefully
stowed
away
in
the
hold
there
to
remain
until
it
was
transferred
at
johns
to
the
silvia
the
steamer
on
which
my
old
friend
so
full
of
life
and
ambition
had
sailed
from
new
york
and
which
now
was
to
carry
him
back
a
corpse
because
of
a
delay
in
getting
her
unloaded
the
aurora
did
not
sail
until
saturday
evening
the
sky
was
all
aglow
with
a
gorgeous
sunset
when
we
weighed
anchor
and
steamed
out
of
cape
charles
harbour
down
across
the
straits
of
belle
isle
the
night
was
equally
glorious
as
darkness
fell
the
sky
and
sea
were
illuminated
by
the
northern
lights
there
was
no
wind
and
the
sea
was
calm
close
to
our
port
side
an
iceberg
with
two
great
spires
towered
high
above
us
another
large
iceberg
was
on
our
starboard
before
us
belle
isle
and
the
french
shore
were
dimly
visible
behind
us
the
rocky
coast
of
labrador
gradually
faded
away
xxiv
hubbard
message
out
voyage
from
labrador
to
newfoundland
was
uneventful
and
on
tuesday
morning
may
the
aurora
steamed
into
johns
harbour
i
was
on
the
bridge
with
captain
kean
when
we
passed
through
the
narrows
eagerly
looking
to
see
if
the
ship
was
there
that
was
to
take
us
home
to
my
great
satisfaction
the
silvia
was
at
her
wharf
and
george
and
i
lost
no
time
in
presenting
ourselves
to
my
old
friend
captain
farrell
her
commander
who
was
engaged
on
deck
when
we
arrived
he
literally
took
me
to
his
arms
in
welcome
and
like
everyone
in
johns
showed
me
the
greatest
consideration
and
kindness
bowring
company
the
owners
of
the
aurora
placed
at
my
disposal
their
steam
launch
and
such
men
as
i
needed
to
aid
me
in
the
transference
of
the
body
from
the
aurora
to
the
silvia
and
they
would
make
no
charge
for
either
this
service
or
for
our
passage
from
cape
charles
to
johns
on
friday
morning
may
the
silvia
sailed
from
john
and
one
week
later
friday
the
with
her
flag
at
half
mast
steamed
slowly
to
her
dock
in
brooklyn
it
was
a
sad
scarcely
a
year
before
hubbard
and
gay
filled
with
hope
and
ambition
and
manly
vigour
had
stood
by
my
side
on
that
very
deck
as
together
we
waved
farewell
to
the
friends
that
were
gathered
now
to
welcome
george
and
me
back
i
thought
of
how
when
we
were
fighting
our
way
across
the
desolate
wilderness
he
had
talked
of
and
planned
for
this
hour
and
thought
of
his
childlike
faith
that
god
would
take
care
of
us
and
lead
us
safely
out
and
then
i
asked
myself
why
george
and
i
whose
faith
was
so
much
the
weaker
had
been
spared
while
hubbard
who
never
lost
sight
of
the
religion
of
his
youth
was
left
to
die
i
felt
that
i
was
the
least
deserving
and
i
lived
and
hubbard
died
why
i
had
no
answer
to
the
question
that
was
god
secret
perhaps
hubbard
work
in
the
fulness
of
his
plan
had
been
completed
perhaps
he
still
had
work
for
me
to
do
we
laid
him
to
rest
in
a
beautiful
spot
in
the
little
cemetery
at
haverstraw
at
the
very
foot
of
the
mountains
that
he
used
to
roam
and
overlooking
the
grand
old
hudson
that
he
loved
so
well
the
mountains
will
know
him
no
more
and
never
again
will
he
dip
his
paddle
into
the
placid
waters
of
the
river
but
his
noble
character
his
simple
faith
a
faith
that
never
wavered
but
grew
the
stronger
in
his
hour
of
trouble
his
bravery
his
indomitable
will
these
shall
not
be
forgotten
they
shall
remain
a
living
example
to
all
who
love
bravery
and
the
critics
have
said
that
hubbard
was
foolhardy
and
without
proper
preparation
he
plunged
blindly
into
an
unknown
wilderness
i
believe
the
early
chapters
of
this
narrative
show
that
these
criticisms
are
unfounded
and
that
hubbard
took
every
precaution
that
could
occur
to
a
reasonable
mind
himself
a
thorough
student
of
wilderness
travel
in
making
his
preparations
for
the
journey
he
sought
the
advice
of
men
of
wider
experience
as
to
every
little
detail
and
acted
upon
it
others
tell
how
might
have
been
made
from
willow
bark
after
the
manner
of
the
indians
and
describe
other
means
of
securing
food
that
they
claim
men
familiar
with
woodcraft
would
have
resorted
to
the
preceding
chapters
show
how
impracticable
it
would
have
been
for
us
to
have
consumed
our
small
stock
of
provisions
while
manufacturing
a
from
bark
and
how
we
did
resort
to
every
method
at
our
command
of
procuring
food
unfortunately
we
fell
upon
a
year
of
paucity
the
old
men
of
the
country
bore
witness
that
never
before
within
their
memory
had
there
been
such
a
scarcity
of
game
but
by
far
the
most
serious
criticism
of
all
to
my
mind
is
that
against
the
object
of
the
expedition
it
has
been
said
that
even
had
hubbard
succeeded
in
accomplishing
everything
that
he
set
out
to
do
the
result
would
have
been
of
little
or
no
value
to
the
world
in
answer
to
this
i
can
not
do
better
than
to
quote
from
the
eloquent
tribute
to
hubbard
expedition
made
by
his
old
college
friend
james
leroy
in
the
magazine
issued
by
the
alumni
association
of
their
alma
mater
editorial
wiseacres
says
leroy
may
preach
that
such
efforts
as
hubbard
made
are
of
no
great
immediate
value
to
the
world
even
if
successful
but
the
man
who
is
born
with
the
insatiable
desire
to
do
something
to
see
what
other
men
have
not
seen
to
push
into
the
waste
places
of
the
world
to
make
a
new
discovery
to
develop
a
new
theme
or
enrich
an
old
to
contribute
in
other
words
to
the
fund
of
human
knowledge
is
always
something
more
than
a
mere
seeker
for
notoriety
he
belongs
however
slight
may
be
his
actual
contribution
to
knowledge
however
great
his
success
or
complete
his
failure
to
that
minority
which
has
from
the
first
kept
the
world
moving
on
while
the
vast
majority
have
peacefully
travelled
on
with
it
in
its
course
the
unpoetical
critic
will
not
understand
him
will
find
it
easy
to
call
him
a
dreamer
yet
it
is
from
dreams
like
these
that
have
come
the
world
inspirations
and
its
great
achievements
without
any
trace
of
the
finicality
that
so
often
is
pure
morbidity
hubbard
was
the
most
conscientious
man
i
ever
knew
a
man
who
was
continually
thinking
of
others
and
how
he
might
help
them
doubtless
some
will
see
in
his
brave
life
struggle
only
a
determination
to
win
for
himself
a
recognised
place
as
a
writer
and
expert
upon
life
but
those
who
were
privileged
to
enjoy
his
intimacy
know
that
the
deep
underlying
purpose
of
the
man
was
to
fit
himself
to
deliver
to
the
world
a
message
that
he
felt
to
be
profoundly
true
a
message
that
should
inspire
his
to
encounter
the
battle
of
life
without
flinching
that
should
make
them
realise
that
unceasing
endeavour
and
loyalty
to
god
their
conscience
and
their
brothers
are
indeed
worth
while
he
died
before
he
reached
the
goal
of
his
ambition
but
i
do
not
believe
that
his
message
was
undelivered
only
men
that
have
camped
together
in
a
lonely
uninhabited
country
can
in
any
degree
comprehend
the
bond
of
affection
and
love
that
drew
hubbard
and
me
ever
closer
to
each
other
as
the
labrador
wild
lured
us
on
and
on
into
the
depths
of
its
desolate
waste
the
work
must
be
done
he
used
to
say
and
if
one
of
us
falls
before
it
is
completed
the
other
must
finish
it
his
words
ring
in
my
ear
as
a
call
to
duty
i
see
his
dear
brave
face
before
me
now
i
feel
his
lips
upon
my
cheek
the
smoke
of
the
is
in
my
blood
the
fragrance
of
the
forest
is
in
my
nostrils
perhaps
it
is
god
will
that
i
finish
the
work
of
exploration
that
hubbard
began
