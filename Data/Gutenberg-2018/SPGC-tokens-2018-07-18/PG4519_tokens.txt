i
when
professor
linyard
came
back
from
his
holiday
in
the
maine
woods
the
air
of
rejuvenation
he
brought
with
him
was
due
less
to
the
influences
of
the
climate
than
to
the
companionship
he
had
enjoyed
on
his
travels
to
linyard
observant
eye
he
had
appeared
to
set
out
alone
but
an
invisible
traveller
had
in
fact
accompanied
him
and
if
his
heart
beat
high
it
was
simply
at
the
pitch
of
his
adventure
for
the
professor
had
eloped
with
an
idea
no
one
who
has
not
tried
the
experiment
can
divine
its
exhilaration
professor
linyard
would
not
have
changed
places
with
any
hero
of
romance
pledged
to
a
abduction
the
most
fascinating
female
is
apt
to
be
encumbered
with
luggage
and
scruples
to
take
up
a
good
deal
of
room
in
the
present
and
overlap
inconveniently
into
the
future
whereas
an
idea
can
accommodate
itself
to
a
single
molecule
of
the
brain
or
expand
to
the
circumference
of
the
horizon
the
professor
companion
had
to
the
utmost
this
quality
of
adaptability
as
the
express
train
whirled
him
away
from
the
somewhat
inelastic
circle
of
linyard
affections
his
idea
seemed
to
be
sitting
opposite
him
and
their
eyes
met
every
moment
or
two
in
a
glance
of
joyous
complicity
yet
when
a
friend
of
the
family
presently
joined
him
and
began
to
talk
about
college
matters
the
idea
slipped
out
of
sight
in
a
flash
and
the
professor
would
have
had
no
difficulty
in
proving
that
he
was
alone
but
if
from
the
outset
he
found
his
idea
the
most
agreeable
of
it
was
only
in
the
aromatic
solitude
of
the
woods
that
he
tasted
the
full
savour
of
his
adventure
there
during
the
long
cool
august
days
lying
full
length
on
the
and
gazing
up
into
the
sky
he
would
meet
the
eyes
of
his
companion
bending
over
him
like
a
nearer
heaven
and
what
eyes
they
were
clear
yet
unfathomable
bubbling
with
inexhaustible
laughter
yet
drawing
their
freshness
and
sparkle
from
the
central
depths
of
thought
to
a
man
who
for
twenty
years
had
faced
an
eye
reflecting
the
obvious
with
perfect
accuracy
these
escapes
into
the
inscrutable
had
always
been
peculiarly
inviting
but
hitherto
the
professor
mental
infidelities
had
been
restricted
by
an
unbroken
and
relentless
domesticity
now
for
the
first
time
since
his
marriage
chance
had
given
him
six
weeks
to
himself
and
he
was
coming
home
with
his
lungs
full
of
liberty
it
must
not
be
inferred
that
the
professor
domestic
relations
were
defective
they
were
in
fact
so
complete
that
it
was
almost
impossible
to
get
away
from
them
it
is
the
happy
husbands
who
are
really
in
bondage
the
little
rift
within
the
lute
is
often
a
passage
to
freedom
marriage
had
given
the
professor
exactly
what
he
had
sought
in
it
a
comfortable
lining
to
life
the
impossibility
of
rising
to
sentimental
crises
had
made
him
scrupulously
careful
not
to
shirk
the
practical
obligations
of
the
bond
he
took
as
it
were
a
sociological
view
of
his
case
and
modestly
regarded
himself
as
a
brick
in
that
foundation
on
which
the
state
is
supposed
to
rest
perhaps
if
linyard
had
cared
about
entomology
or
had
taken
sides
in
the
war
over
the
transmission
of
acquired
characteristics
he
might
have
had
a
less
impersonal
notion
of
marriage
but
he
was
unconscious
of
any
deficiency
in
their
relation
and
if
consulted
would
probably
have
declared
that
he
want
any
woman
bothering
with
his
beetles
his
real
life
had
always
lain
in
the
universe
of
thought
in
that
enchanted
region
which
to
those
who
have
lingered
there
comes
to
have
so
much
more
colour
and
substance
than
the
painted
curtain
hanging
before
it
the
particular
veil
of
maia
was
a
narrow
strip
of
homespun
woven
in
a
monotonous
pattern
but
he
had
only
to
lift
it
to
step
into
an
empire
this
unseen
universe
was
thronged
with
the
most
seductive
shapes
the
professor
moved
through
a
seraglio
of
ideas
but
of
all
the
lovely
apparitions
that
wove
their
spells
about
him
none
had
ever
worn
quite
so
persuasive
an
aspect
as
this
latest
favourite
for
the
others
were
mostly
rather
grave
companions
and
elevating
enough
to
have
passed
muster
in
a
ladies
debating
club
but
this
new
fancy
of
the
professor
was
simply
one
embodied
laugh
it
was
in
other
words
the
smile
of
relaxation
at
the
end
of
a
long
day
toil
the
flash
of
irony
that
the
laborious
mind
projects
irresistibly
over
labour
conscientiously
performed
the
professor
had
always
been
a
hard
worker
if
he
was
an
indulgent
friend
to
his
ideas
he
was
also
a
stern
to
them
for
in
addition
to
their
other
duties
they
had
to
support
his
family
to
pay
the
butcher
and
baker
and
provide
for
jack
schooling
and
millicent
dresses
the
professor
household
was
a
modest
one
yet
it
tasked
his
ideas
to
keep
it
up
to
his
standard
linyard
was
not
an
exacting
wife
and
she
took
enough
pride
in
her
husband
attainments
to
pay
for
her
honours
by
turning
millicent
dresses
and
darning
jack
socks
and
going
to
the
college
receptions
year
after
year
in
the
same
black
silk
with
shiny
seams
it
consoled
her
to
see
an
occasional
mention
of
professor
remarkable
monograph
on
the
ethical
reactions
of
the
infusoria
or
an
allusion
to
his
investigations
into
the
unconscious
cerebration
of
the
amoeba
still
there
were
moments
when
the
healthy
indifference
of
jack
and
millicent
reacted
on
the
maternal
sympathies
when
linyard
would
have
made
her
husband
a
if
by
this
transformation
she
might
have
increased
her
boy
allowance
and
given
her
daughter
a
new
hat
or
a
set
of
furs
such
as
the
other
girls
were
wearing
of
such
moments
of
rebellion
the
professor
himself
was
not
wholly
unconscious
he
could
not
indeed
understand
why
any
one
should
want
a
new
hat
and
as
to
an
allowance
he
had
had
much
less
money
at
college
than
jack
and
had
yet
managed
to
buy
a
microscope
and
collect
a
few
specimens
while
jack
was
free
from
such
expensive
tastes
but
the
professor
did
not
let
his
want
of
sympathy
interfere
with
the
discharge
of
his
paternal
obligations
he
worked
hard
to
keep
the
wants
of
his
family
gratified
and
it
was
precisely
in
the
endeavor
to
attain
this
end
that
he
at
length
broke
down
and
had
to
cease
from
work
altogether
to
cease
from
work
was
not
to
cease
from
thought
of
it
and
in
the
unwonted
pause
from
effort
the
professor
found
himself
taking
a
general
survey
of
the
field
he
had
travelled
at
last
it
was
possible
to
lift
his
nose
from
the
loom
to
step
a
moment
in
front
of
the
tapestry
he
had
been
weaving
from
this
first
inspection
of
the
pattern
so
long
wrought
over
from
behind
it
was
natural
to
glance
a
little
farther
and
seek
its
reflection
in
the
public
eye
it
was
not
indeed
of
his
special
task
that
he
thought
in
this
connection
he
was
but
one
of
the
great
army
of
weavers
at
work
among
the
threads
of
that
cosmic
woof
and
what
he
sought
was
the
general
impression
their
labour
had
produced
when
professor
linyard
first
plied
his
microscope
the
audience
of
the
man
of
science
had
been
composed
of
a
few
sympathetic
or
hostile
as
their
habits
of
mind
predetermined
but
versed
in
the
jargon
of
the
profession
and
familiar
with
the
point
of
departure
in
the
intervening
quarter
of
a
century
however
this
little
group
had
been
swallowed
up
in
a
larger
public
every
one
now
read
scientific
books
and
expressed
an
opinion
on
them
the
ladies
and
the
clergy
had
taken
them
up
first
now
they
had
passed
to
the
and
the
kindergarten
daily
life
was
regulated
on
scientific
principles
the
daily
papers
had
their
scientific
jottings
nurses
passed
examinations
in
hygienic
science
and
babies
were
fed
and
dandled
according
to
the
new
psychology
the
very
fact
that
scientific
investigation
still
had
to
some
minds
a
flavour
of
heterodoxy
gave
it
a
perennial
interest
the
mob
had
broken
down
the
walls
of
tradition
to
batten
in
the
orchard
of
forbidden
knowledge
the
inaccessible
goddess
whom
the
professor
had
served
in
his
youth
now
offered
her
charms
in
the
and
yet
it
was
not
the
same
goddess
after
all
but
a
masquerading
in
the
garb
of
the
real
divinity
this
false
goddess
had
her
ritual
and
her
literature
she
had
her
sacred
books
written
by
false
priests
and
sold
by
millions
to
the
faithful
in
the
most
successful
of
these
works
ancient
dogma
and
modern
discovery
were
depicted
in
a
close
embrace
under
the
of
a
hazy
transcendentalism
and
the
tableau
never
failed
of
its
effect
some
of
the
books
designed
on
this
popular
model
had
lately
fallen
into
the
professor
hands
and
they
filled
him
with
mingled
rage
and
hilarity
the
rage
soon
died
he
came
to
regard
this
mass
of
as
protecting
the
truth
from
desecration
but
the
hilarity
remained
and
flowed
into
the
form
of
his
idea
and
the
idea
the
divine
incomparable
idea
was
simply
that
he
should
avenge
his
goddess
by
satirizing
her
false
interpreters
he
would
write
a
skit
on
the
popular
scientific
book
he
would
so
heap
platitude
on
platitude
fallacy
on
fallacy
false
analogy
on
false
analogy
so
use
his
superior
knowledge
to
abound
in
the
sense
of
the
ignorant
that
even
the
gross
crowd
would
join
in
the
laugh
against
its
augurs
and
the
laugh
should
be
something
more
than
the
distension
of
mental
muscles
it
should
be
the
bringing
down
the
walls
of
ignorance
or
at
least
the
little
stone
striking
the
giant
between
the
eyes
ii
the
professor
on
presenting
his
card
had
imagined
that
it
would
command
prompt
access
to
the
publisher
sanctuary
but
the
young
man
who
read
his
name
was
not
moved
to
immediate
action
it
was
clear
that
professor
linyard
of
hillbridge
university
was
not
a
specific
figure
to
the
purveyors
of
popular
literature
but
the
publisher
was
an
old
friend
and
when
the
card
had
finally
drifted
to
his
office
on
the
languid
tide
of
routine
he
came
forth
at
once
to
greet
his
visitor
the
warmth
of
his
welcome
convinced
the
professor
that
he
had
been
right
in
bringing
his
manuscript
to
ned
harviss
he
and
harviss
had
been
at
hillbridge
together
and
the
future
publisher
had
been
one
of
the
wildest
spirits
in
that
band
of
college
outlaws
which
yearly
turns
out
so
many
inoffensive
citizens
and
kind
husbands
and
fathers
the
professor
knew
the
taming
qualities
of
life
he
was
aware
that
many
of
his
most
reckless
comrades
had
been
transformed
into
prudent
capitalists
or
cowed
but
he
was
almost
sure
that
he
could
count
on
harviss
so
rare
a
sense
of
irony
so
keen
a
perception
of
relative
values
could
hardly
have
been
blunted
even
by
twenty
intercourse
with
the
obvious
the
publisher
appearance
was
a
little
disconcerting
he
looked
as
if
he
had
been
fattened
on
popular
fiction
and
his
fat
was
full
of
optimistic
creases
the
professor
seemed
to
see
him
bowing
into
his
office
a
long
train
of
spotless
heroines
laden
with
the
maiden
tribute
of
the
hundredth
thousand
volume
nevertheless
his
welcome
was
reassuring
he
did
not
disown
his
early
enormities
and
capped
his
visitor
tentative
allusions
by
such
flagrant
references
to
the
past
that
the
professor
produced
his
manuscript
without
a
scruple
what
you
do
mean
to
say
you
been
doing
something
in
our
line
the
professor
smiled
you
publish
scientific
books
sometimes
you
the
publisher
optimistic
creases
relaxed
a
little
h
it
all
depends
i
afraid
you
a
little
scientific
for
us
we
have
a
big
sale
for
scientific
breakfast
foods
but
not
for
the
concentrated
essences
in
your
case
of
course
i
should
be
delighted
to
stretch
a
point
but
in
your
own
interest
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
perhaps
one
of
the
educational
houses
would
do
you
better
the
professor
leaned
back
still
smiling
luxuriously
well
look
it
over
i
rather
think
you
take
it
oh
we
it
as
i
say
but
the
terms
might
not
no
matter
about
the
terms
the
publisher
threw
his
head
back
with
a
laugh
i
had
no
idea
that
science
was
so
profitable
we
find
our
popular
novelists
are
the
hardest
hands
at
a
bargain
science
is
disinterested
the
professor
corrected
him
and
i
have
a
fancy
to
have
you
publish
this
thing
that
immensely
good
of
you
my
dear
fellow
of
course
your
name
goes
with
a
certain
public
and
i
rather
like
the
originality
of
our
bringing
out
a
work
so
out
of
our
line
i
daresay
it
may
boom
us
both
his
creases
deepened
at
the
thought
and
he
shone
encouragingly
on
the
professor
within
a
fortnight
a
line
from
harviss
recalled
the
professor
to
town
he
had
been
looking
forward
with
immense
zest
to
this
second
meeting
harviss
college
roar
was
in
his
tympanum
and
he
pictured
himself
following
up
the
protracted
chuckle
which
would
follow
his
progress
through
the
manuscript
he
was
proud
of
the
adroitness
with
which
he
had
kept
his
secret
from
harviss
had
maintained
to
the
last
the
pretense
of
a
serious
work
in
order
to
give
the
keener
edge
to
his
reader
enjoyment
not
since
days
had
the
professor
tasted
such
a
draught
of
pure
fun
as
his
anticipations
now
poured
for
him
this
time
his
card
brought
instant
admission
he
was
bowed
into
the
office
like
a
successful
novelist
and
harviss
grasped
him
with
both
hands
well
do
you
mean
to
take
it
he
asked
with
a
lingering
coquetry
take
it
take
it
my
dear
fellow
it
in
press
already
you
excuse
my
not
waiting
to
consult
you
there
will
be
no
difficulty
about
terms
i
assure
you
and
we
had
barely
time
to
catch
the
autumn
market
my
dear
linyard
why
did
you
me
his
voice
sank
to
a
reproachful
solemnity
and
he
pushed
forward
his
own
the
professor
dropped
into
it
with
a
chuckle
and
miss
the
joy
of
letting
you
find
out
well
it
a
joy
harviss
held
out
a
box
of
his
best
cigars
i
do
know
when
i
had
a
bigger
sensation
it
was
so
deucedly
unexpected
and
my
dear
fellow
you
brought
it
so
exactly
to
the
right
shop
i
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
said
the
professor
modestly
harviss
laughed
in
rich
appreciation
i
do
suppose
you
had
a
doubt
of
it
but
of
course
i
was
quite
unprepared
and
it
so
extraordinarily
out
of
your
line
the
professor
took
off
his
glasses
and
rubbed
them
with
a
slow
smile
would
you
have
thought
it
so
at
college
harviss
stared
at
college
why
you
were
the
most
iconoclastic
devil
there
was
a
perceptible
pause
the
professor
restored
his
glasses
and
looked
at
his
friend
well
he
said
simply
well
echoed
the
other
still
staring
ah
i
see
you
mean
that
that
what
explains
it
the
swing
of
the
pendulum
and
so
forth
well
i
admit
it
not
an
uncommon
phenomenon
i
conformed
myself
for
example
most
of
our
crowd
have
i
believe
but
somehow
i
expected
it
of
you
the
close
observer
might
have
detected
a
faint
sadness
under
the
official
congratulation
of
his
tone
but
the
professor
was
too
amazed
to
have
an
ear
for
such
fine
shades
expected
it
of
me
expected
what
of
me
he
gasped
what
in
heaven
do
you
think
this
thing
is
and
he
struck
his
fist
on
the
manuscript
which
lay
between
them
harviss
had
recovered
his
optimistic
creases
he
rested
a
benevolent
eye
on
the
document
why
your
apologia
your
confession
of
faith
i
should
call
it
you
surely
must
have
seen
which
way
you
were
going
you
ca
have
written
it
in
your
sleep
oh
no
i
was
wide
awake
enough
said
the
professor
faintly
well
then
why
are
you
staring
at
me
as
if
i
were
harviss
leaned
forward
to
lay
a
reassuring
hand
on
his
visitor
worn
do
mistake
me
my
dear
linyard
do
fancy
there
was
the
least
unkindness
in
my
allusion
to
your
change
of
front
what
is
growth
but
the
shifting
of
the
why
should
a
man
be
expected
to
look
at
life
with
the
same
eyes
at
twenty
and
at
our
age
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
you
could
feel
the
least
delicacy
in
admitting
that
you
have
come
round
a
little
have
fallen
into
line
so
to
speak
but
the
professor
had
sprung
up
as
if
to
give
his
lungs
more
room
to
expand
and
from
them
there
issued
a
laugh
which
shook
the
editorial
rafters
oh
lord
oh
lord
is
it
really
as
good
as
that
he
gasped
harviss
had
glanced
instinctively
toward
the
electric
bell
on
his
desk
it
was
evident
that
he
was
prepared
for
an
emergency
my
dear
fellow
he
began
in
a
soothing
tone
oh
let
me
have
my
laugh
out
do
implored
the
professor
i
quiet
down
in
a
minute
you
need
ring
for
the
young
man
he
dropped
into
his
chair
again
and
grasped
its
arms
to
steady
his
shaking
this
is
the
best
laugh
i
had
since
college
he
brought
out
between
his
paroxysms
and
then
suddenly
he
sat
up
with
a
groan
but
if
it
as
good
as
that
it
a
failure
he
exclaimed
harviss
stiffening
a
little
examined
the
tip
of
his
cigar
my
dear
linyard
he
said
at
length
i
do
understand
a
word
you
saying
the
professor
succumbed
to
a
fresh
access
from
the
vortex
of
which
he
managed
to
fling
out
but
that
the
very
core
of
the
joke
harviss
looked
at
him
resignedly
what
is
why
your
not
seeing
your
not
understanding
not
understanding
why
what
the
book
is
meant
to
be
his
laughter
subsided
again
and
he
sat
gazing
thoughtfully
at
the
publisher
unless
it
means
he
wound
up
that
i
the
mark
if
i
am
the
mark
you
certainly
have
said
harviss
with
a
glance
at
the
clock
the
professor
caught
the
glance
and
interpreted
it
the
book
is
a
skit
he
said
rising
the
other
stared
a
skit
it
not
serious
you
mean
not
to
me
but
it
seems
you
taken
it
so
you
never
told
me
began
the
publisher
in
a
ruffled
tone
no
i
never
told
you
said
the
professor
harviss
sat
staring
at
the
manuscript
between
them
i
do
pretend
to
be
up
in
such
recondite
forms
of
humour
he
said
still
stiffly
of
course
you
address
yourself
to
a
very
small
class
of
readers
oh
infinitely
small
admitted
the
professor
extending
his
hand
toward
the
manuscript
harviss
appeared
to
be
pursuing
his
own
train
of
thought
that
is
he
continued
if
you
insist
on
an
ironical
interpretation
if
i
insist
on
it
what
do
you
mean
the
publisher
smiled
faintly
well
is
the
book
susceptible
of
another
if
read
it
without
seeing
well
murmured
the
other
why
should
the
rest
of
the
world
declared
harviss
boldly
i
represent
the
average
reader
that
my
business
that
what
i
been
training
myself
to
do
for
the
last
twenty
years
it
a
mission
like
another
the
thing
is
to
do
it
thoroughly
not
to
cheat
and
compromise
i
know
fellows
who
are
publishers
in
business
hours
and
dilettantes
the
rest
of
the
time
well
they
never
succeed
convictions
are
just
as
necessary
in
business
as
in
religion
but
that
not
the
point
i
was
going
to
say
that
if
you
let
me
handle
this
book
as
a
genuine
thing
i
guarantee
to
make
it
go
the
professor
stood
motionless
his
hand
still
on
the
manuscript
a
genuine
thing
he
echoed
a
serious
piece
of
work
the
expression
of
your
convictions
i
tell
you
there
nothing
the
public
likes
as
much
as
convictions
always
follow
a
man
who
believes
in
his
own
ideas
and
this
book
is
just
on
the
line
of
popular
interest
you
got
hold
of
a
big
thing
it
full
of
hope
and
enthusiasm
it
written
in
the
religious
key
there
are
passages
in
it
that
would
do
splendidly
in
a
birthday
book
things
that
popular
preachers
would
quote
in
their
sermons
if
you
wanted
to
catch
a
big
public
you
could
have
gone
about
it
in
a
better
way
the
thing
perfect
for
my
purpose
i
would
let
you
alter
a
word
of
it
it
sell
like
a
popular
novel
if
you
let
me
handle
it
in
the
right
way
iii
when
the
professor
left
harviss
office
the
manuscript
remained
behind
he
thought
he
had
been
taken
by
the
huge
irony
of
the
situation
by
the
enlarged
circumference
of
the
joke
in
its
original
form
as
harviss
had
said
the
book
would
have
addressed
itself
to
a
very
limited
circle
now
it
would
include
the
world
the
elect
would
understand
the
crowd
would
not
and
his
work
would
thus
serve
a
double
purpose
and
after
all
nothing
was
changed
in
the
situation
not
a
word
of
the
book
was
to
be
altered
the
change
was
merely
in
the
publisher
point
of
view
and
in
the
tip
he
was
to
give
the
reviewers
the
professor
had
only
to
hold
his
tongue
and
look
serious
these
arguments
found
a
strong
reinforcement
in
the
large
premium
which
expressed
harviss
sense
of
his
opportunity
as
a
satire
the
book
would
have
brought
its
author
nothing
in
fact
its
cost
would
have
come
out
of
his
own
pocket
since
as
harviss
assured
him
no
publisher
would
have
risked
taking
it
but
as
a
profession
of
faith
as
the
recantation
of
an
eminent
biologist
whose
leanings
had
hitherto
been
supposed
to
be
toward
a
cold
determinism
it
would
bring
in
a
steady
income
to
author
and
publisher
the
offer
found
the
professor
in
a
moment
of
financial
perplexity
his
illness
his
unwonted
holiday
the
necessity
of
postponing
a
course
of
lectures
had
combined
to
diminish
his
resources
and
when
harviss
offered
him
an
advance
of
a
thousand
dollars
the
esoteric
savour
of
the
joke
became
irresistible
it
was
still
as
a
joke
that
he
persisted
in
regarding
the
transaction
and
though
he
had
pledged
himself
not
to
betray
the
real
intent
of
the
book
he
held
the
notion
of
some
day
being
able
to
take
the
public
into
his
confidence
as
for
the
initiated
they
would
know
at
once
and
however
long
a
face
he
pulled
his
colleagues
would
see
the
tongue
in
his
cheek
meanwhile
it
fortunately
happened
that
even
if
the
book
should
achieve
the
kind
of
triumph
prophesied
by
harviss
it
would
not
appreciably
injure
its
author
professional
standing
professor
linyard
was
known
chiefly
as
a
microscopist
on
the
structure
and
habits
of
a
certain
class
of
coleoptera
he
was
the
most
distinguished
living
authority
but
none
save
his
intimate
friends
knew
what
generalizations
on
the
destiny
of
man
he
had
drawn
from
these
special
studies
he
might
have
published
a
treatise
on
the
filioque
without
disturbing
the
confidence
of
those
on
whose
approval
his
reputation
rested
and
moreover
he
was
sustained
by
the
thought
that
one
glance
at
his
book
would
let
them
into
its
secret
in
fact
so
sure
was
he
of
this
that
he
wondered
the
astute
harviss
had
cared
to
risk
such
speedy
exposure
but
harviss
had
probably
reflected
that
even
in
this
reverberating
age
the
opinions
of
the
laboratory
do
not
easily
reach
the
street
and
the
professor
at
any
rate
was
not
bound
to
offer
advice
on
this
point
the
determining
cause
of
his
consent
was
the
fact
that
the
book
was
already
in
press
the
professor
knew
little
about
the
workings
of
the
press
but
the
phrase
gave
him
a
sense
of
finality
of
having
been
caught
himself
in
the
toils
of
that
mysterious
engine
if
he
had
had
time
to
think
the
matter
over
his
scruples
might
have
dragged
him
back
but
his
conscience
was
eased
by
the
futility
of
resistance
iv
linyard
did
not
often
read
the
papers
and
there
was
therefore
a
special
significance
in
her
approaching
her
husband
one
evening
after
dinner
with
a
copy
of
the
york
in
her
hand
her
expression
lent
solemnity
to
the
act
linyard
had
a
limited
but
distinctive
set
of
expressions
and
she
now
looked
as
she
did
when
the
president
of
the
university
came
to
dine
you
did
tell
me
of
this
samuel
she
said
in
a
slightly
tremulous
voice
tell
you
of
what
returned
the
professor
reddening
to
the
margin
of
his
baldness
that
you
had
published
a
book
i
might
never
have
heard
of
it
if
pease
had
brought
me
the
paper
her
husband
rubbed
his
with
a
groan
oh
you
would
have
heard
of
it
he
said
gloomily
linyard
stared
did
you
wish
to
keep
it
from
me
samuel
and
as
he
made
no
answer
she
added
with
irresistible
pride
perhaps
you
do
know
what
beautiful
things
have
been
said
about
it
he
took
the
paper
with
a
reluctant
hand
has
pease
been
saying
beautiful
things
about
it
the
professor
pease
did
say
he
had
mentioned
it
the
author
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
his
book
as
harviss
had
prophesied
had
caught
the
autumn
market
had
caught
and
captured
it
the
publisher
had
conducted
the
campaign
like
an
experienced
strategist
he
had
completely
surrounded
the
enemy
every
newspaper
every
periodical
held
in
ambush
an
advertisement
of
the
vital
thing
weeks
in
advance
the
great
commander
had
begun
to
form
his
lines
of
attack
allusions
to
the
remarkable
significance
of
the
coming
work
had
appeared
first
in
the
scientific
and
literary
reviews
spreading
thence
to
the
supplements
of
the
daily
journals
not
a
moment
passed
without
a
quickening
touch
to
the
public
consciousness
seventy
millions
of
people
were
forced
to
remember
at
least
once
a
day
that
professor
linyard
book
was
on
the
verge
of
appearing
slips
emblazoned
with
the
question
you
read
the
vital
thing
fell
from
the
pages
of
popular
novels
and
whitened
the
floors
of
crowded
the
query
in
large
lettering
assaulted
the
traveller
at
the
railway
bookstall
confronted
him
on
the
walls
of
elevated
stations
and
seemed
in
its
ascending
scale
about
to
supplant
the
interrogations
as
to
soap
and
which
animate
our
rural
scenery
on
the
day
of
publication
the
professor
had
withdrawn
to
his
laboratory
the
shriek
of
the
advertisements
was
in
his
ears
and
his
one
desire
was
to
avoid
all
knowledge
of
the
event
they
heralded
a
reaction
of
had
set
in
and
if
harviss
cheque
had
sufficed
to
buy
up
the
first
edition
of
the
vital
thing
the
professor
would
gladly
have
devoted
it
to
that
purpose
but
the
sense
of
inevitableness
gradually
subdued
him
and
he
received
his
wife
copy
of
the
with
a
kind
of
impersonal
curiosity
the
review
was
a
long
one
full
of
extracts
he
saw
as
he
glanced
over
them
how
well
they
would
look
in
a
volume
of
selections
the
reviewer
began
by
thanking
his
author
for
sounding
with
no
uncertain
voice
that
note
of
ringing
optimism
of
faith
in
man
destiny
and
the
supremacy
of
good
which
has
too
long
been
silenced
by
the
whining
chorus
of
a
decadent
nihilism
it
is
well
the
writer
continued
when
such
reminders
come
to
us
not
from
the
moralist
but
from
the
man
of
science
when
from
the
desiccating
atmosphere
of
the
laboratory
there
rises
this
glorious
cry
of
faith
and
reconstruction
the
review
was
minute
and
exhaustive
thanks
no
doubt
to
diplomacy
it
had
been
given
to
the
best
man
and
the
professor
was
startled
by
the
bold
eye
with
which
his
emancipated
fallacies
confronted
him
under
the
reviewer
handling
they
made
up
admirably
as
truths
and
their
author
began
to
understand
regret
that
they
should
be
used
for
any
less
profitable
purpose
the
as
harviss
phrased
it
set
the
pace
and
the
other
journals
followed
finding
it
easier
to
let
their
critical
play
a
variation
on
the
first
reviewer
theme
than
to
secure
an
expert
to
do
the
book
afresh
but
it
was
evident
that
the
professor
had
captured
his
public
for
all
the
resources
of
the
profession
could
not
as
harviss
gleefully
pointed
out
have
carried
the
book
so
straight
to
the
heart
of
the
nation
there
was
something
noble
in
the
way
in
which
harviss
belittled
his
own
share
in
the
achievement
and
insisted
on
the
inutility
of
shoving
a
book
which
had
started
with
such
headway
on
all
i
ask
you
is
to
admit
that
i
saw
what
would
happen
he
said
with
a
touch
of
professional
pride
i
knew
you
struck
the
right
note
i
knew
they
be
quoting
you
from
maine
to
san
francisco
good
as
fiction
it
better
it
keep
going
longer
will
it
said
the
professor
with
a
slight
shudder
he
was
resigned
to
an
ephemeral
triumph
but
the
thought
of
the
book
persistency
frightened
him
i
should
say
so
why
you
fit
in
everywhere
science
theology
natural
history
and
then
the
element
which
is
so
popular
just
now
why
you
come
right
in
with
the
series
and
they
sell
way
up
in
the
millions
and
then
the
book
so
full
of
tenderness
there
are
such
lovely
things
in
it
about
flowers
and
children
i
did
know
an
old
dryasdust
like
you
could
have
such
a
lot
of
sentiment
in
him
why
i
actually
caught
myself
snivelling
over
that
passage
about
the
snowdrops
piercing
the
frozen
earth
and
my
wife
was
saying
the
other
day
that
since
she
read
vital
thing
she
begins
to
think
you
must
write
the
column
in
the
he
threw
back
his
head
with
a
laugh
which
ended
in
the
inspired
cry
and
by
george
sir
when
the
thing
begins
to
slow
off
we
start
somebody
writing
against
it
and
that
will
run
us
straight
into
another
hundred
thousand
and
as
earnest
of
this
belief
he
drew
the
professor
a
supplementary
cheque
v
linyard
knock
cut
short
the
importunities
of
the
lady
who
had
been
trying
to
persuade
the
professor
to
be
taken
by
flashlight
at
his
study
table
for
the
christmas
number
of
the
on
this
point
the
professor
had
fancied
himself
impregnable
but
the
unwonted
smile
with
which
he
welcomed
his
wife
intrusion
showed
that
his
defences
were
weakening
the
lady
from
the
took
the
hint
with
professional
promptness
but
said
brightly
as
she
snapped
the
elastic
around
her
i
sha
let
you
forget
me
professor
the
groan
with
which
he
followed
her
retreat
was
interrupted
by
his
wife
question
do
they
pay
you
for
these
interviews
samuel
the
professor
looked
at
her
with
sudden
attention
not
directly
he
said
wondering
at
her
expression
she
sank
down
with
a
sigh
indirectly
then
what
is
the
matter
my
dear
i
gave
you
harviss
second
cheque
the
other
day
her
tears
arrested
him
do
be
hard
on
the
boy
samuel
i
really
believe
your
success
has
turned
his
head
the
boy
what
boy
my
success
explain
yourself
susan
it
only
that
jack
has
has
borrowed
some
money
which
he
repay
but
you
must
think
him
altogether
to
blame
samuel
since
the
success
of
your
book
he
has
been
asked
about
so
much
it
given
the
children
quite
a
different
position
millicent
says
that
wherever
they
go
the
first
question
asked
is
you
any
relation
of
the
author
of
the
vital
thing
of
course
we
all
very
proud
of
the
book
but
it
entails
obligations
which
you
may
not
have
thought
of
in
writing
it
the
professor
sat
gazing
at
the
letters
and
newspaper
clippings
on
the
which
he
had
just
successfully
defended
from
the
camera
of
the
he
took
up
an
envelope
bearing
the
name
of
a
popular
weekly
paper
i
do
know
that
the
would
help
much
he
said
but
i
suppose
this
might
linyard
eyes
glowed
with
maternal
avidity

is
it

believe
that
journal
has
a
larger
circulation
than
any
other
weekly
and
they
pay
in
proportion
he
had
not
even
asked
the
extent
of
jack
indebtedness
it
had
been
so
easy
to
relieve
recent
domestic
difficulties
by
the
timely
production
of
harviss
two
cheques
that
it
now
seemed
natural
to
get
linyard
out
of
the
room
by
promising
further
reinforcements
the
professor
had
indignantly
rejected
harviss
suggestion
that
he
should
follow
up
his
success
by
a
second
volume
on
the
same
lines
he
had
sworn
not
to
lend
more
than
a
passive
support
to
the
fraud
of
the
vital
thing
but
the
temptation
to
free
himself
from
linyard
prevailed
over
his
last
scruples
and
within
an
hour
he
was
at
work
on
the
scientific
sermons
the
professor
was
not
an
unkind
man
he
really
enjoyed
making
his
family
happy
and
it
was
his
own
business
if
his
reward
for
so
doing
was
that
it
kept
them
out
of
his
way
but
the
success
of
the
vital
thing
gave
him
more
than
this
negative
satisfaction
it
enlarged
his
own
existence
and
opened
new
doors
into
other
lives
the
professor
during
fifty
virtuous
years
had
been
cognizant
of
only
two
types
of
women
the
fond
and
foolish
whom
one
married
and
the
earnest
and
intellectual
whom
one
did
not
of
the
two
he
infinitely
preferred
the
former
even
for
conversational
purposes
but
as
a
social
instrument
woman
was
unknown
to
him
and
it
was
not
till
he
was
drawn
into
the
world
on
the
tide
of
his
literary
success
that
he
discovered
the
deficiencies
in
his
classification
of
the
sex
then
he
learned
with
astonishment
of
the
existence
of
a
third
type
the
woman
who
is
fond
without
foolishness
and
intellectual
without
earnestness
not
that
the
professor
inspired
or
sought
to
inspire
sentimental
emotions
but
he
expanded
in
the
warm
atmosphere
of
personal
interest
which
some
of
his
new
acquaintances
contrived
to
create
about
him
it
was
delightful
to
talk
of
serious
things
in
a
setting
of
frivolity
and
to
be
personal
without
being
domestic
even
in
this
new
world
where
all
subjects
were
touched
on
lightly
and
emphasis
was
the
only
indelicacy
the
professor
found
himself
constrained
to
endure
an
occasional
reference
to
his
book
it
was
unpleasant
at
first
but
gradually
he
slipped
into
the
habit
of
hearing
it
talked
of
and
grew
accustomed
to
telling
pretty
women
just
how
it
had
first
come
to
him
meanwhile
the
success
of
the
scientific
sermons
was
facilitating
his
family
relations
his
photograph
in
the
to
which
the
lady
of
the
had
succeeded
in
appending
a
vivid
interview
carried
his
fame
to
circles
inaccessible
even
to
the
vital
thing
and
the
professor
found
himself
the
man
of
the
hour
he
soon
grew
used
to
the
functions
of
the
office
and
gave
out
interviews
on
every
subject
from
to
babism
with
a
frequency
which
reacted
agreeably
on
the
domestic
exchequer
presently
his
head
began
to
figure
in
the
advertising
pages
of
the
magazines
admiring
readers
learned
the
name
of
the
only
in
use
at
his
table
of
the
ink
with
which
the
vital
thing
had
been
written
the
soap
with
which
the
author
hands
were
washed
and
the
which
fortified
him
for
further
effort
these
confidences
endeared
the
professor
to
millions
of
readers
and
his
head
passed
in
due
course
from
the
magazine
and
the
newspaper
to
the
and
the
vi
the
professor
all
the
while
was
leading
a
double
life
while
the
author
of
the
vital
thing
reaped
the
fruits
of
popular
approval
the
distinguished
microscopist
continued
his
laboratory
work
unheeded
save
by
the
few
who
were
engaged
in
the
same
line
of
investigations
his
divided
allegiance
had
not
hitherto
affected
the
quality
of
his
work
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
returned
to
the
laboratory
with
greater
zest
after
an
afternoon
in
a
where
readings
from
the
vital
thing
had
alternated
with
plantation
melodies
and
tea
he
had
long
ceased
to
concern
himself
with
what
his
colleagues
thought
of
his
literary
career
of
the
few
whom
he
frequented
none
had
referred
to
the
vital
thing
and
he
knew
enough
of
their
lives
to
guess
that
their
silence
might
as
fairly
be
attributed
to
indifference
as
to
disapproval
they
were
intensely
interested
in
the
professor
views
on
beetles
but
they
really
cared
very
little
what
he
thought
of
the
almighty
the
professor
entirely
shared
their
feelings
and
one
of
his
chief
reasons
for
cultivating
the
success
which
accident
had
bestowed
on
him
was
that
it
enabled
him
to
command
a
greater
range
of
appliances
for
his
real
work
he
had
known
what
it
was
to
lack
books
and
instruments
and
the
vital
thing
was
the
magic
wand
which
summoned
them
to
his
aid
for
some
time
he
had
been
feeling
his
way
along
the
edge
of
a
discovery
balancing
himself
with
professional
skill
on
a
plank
of
hypothesis
flung
across
an
abyss
of
uncertainty
the
conjecture
was
the
result
of
years
of
patient
gathering
of
facts
its
corroboration
would
take
months
more
of
comparison
and
classification
but
at
the
end
of
the
vista
victory
loomed
the
professor
felt
within
himself
that
assurance
of
ultimate
justification
which
to
the
man
of
science
makes
a
seem
the
mere
comma
between
premiss
and
deduction
but
he
had
reached
the
point
where
his
conjectures
required
formulation
it
was
only
by
giving
them
expression
by
exposing
them
to
the
comment
and
criticism
of
his
associates
that
he
could
test
their
final
value
and
this
inner
assurance
was
confirmed
by
the
only
friend
whose
confidence
he
invited
professor
pease
the
husband
of
the
lady
who
had
opened
eyes
to
the
triumph
of
the
vital
thing
was
the
repository
of
her
husband
scientific
experiences
what
he
thought
of
the
vital
thing
had
never
been
divulged
and
he
was
capable
of
such
vast
exclusions
that
it
was
quite
possible
that
pervasive
work
had
not
yet
reached
him
in
any
case
it
was
not
likely
to
affect
his
judgment
of
the
professional
capacity
you
want
to
put
that
all
in
a
book
linyard
was
professor
i
sure
you
got
hold
of
something
big
but
to
see
it
clearly
yourself
you
ought
to
outline
it
for
others
take
my
advice
chuck
everything
else
and
get
to
work
tomorrow
it
time
you
wrote
a
book
anyhow
it
time
you
wrote
a
book
anyhow
the
words
smote
the
professor
with
mingled
pain
and
ecstasy
he
could
have
wept
over
their
significance
but
his
friend
other
phrase
reminded
him
with
a
start
of
harviss
you
have
got
hold
of
a
big
thing
it
had
been
the
publisher
first
comment
on
the
vital
thing
but
what
a
world
of
meaning
lay
between
the
two
phrases
it
was
the
world
in
which
the
powers
who
fought
for
the
professor
were
destined
to
wage
their
final
battle
and
for
the
moment
he
had
no
doubt
of
the
outcome
the
next
day
he
went
to
town
to
see
harviss
he
wanted
to
ask
for
an
advance
on
the
new
popular
edition
of
the
vital
thing
he
had
determined
to
drop
a
course
of
supplementary
lectures
at
the
university
and
to
give
himself
up
for
a
year
to
his
book
to
do
this
additional
funds
were
necessary
but
thanks
to
the
vital
thing
they
would
be
forthcoming
the
publisher
received
him
as
cordially
as
usual
but
the
response
to
his
demand
was
not
as
prompt
as
his
previous
experience
had
entitled
him
to
expect
of
course
we
be
glad
to
do
what
we
can
for
you
linyard
but
the
fact
is
we
decided
to
give
up
the
idea
of
the
new
edition
for
the
present
you
given
up
the
new
edition
why
yes
we
done
pretty
well
by
vital
thing
and
inclined
to
think
it
turn
to
do
something
for
it
now
the
professor
looked
at
him
blankly
what
can
i
do
for
it
he
asked
what
his
accent
added
why
put
a
little
new
life
in
it
by
writing
something
else
the
secret
of
perpetual
motion
has
yet
been
discovered
you
know
and
it
one
of
the
laws
of
literature
that
books
which
start
with
a
rush
are
apt
to
slow
down
sooner
than
the
crawlers
we
kept
vital
thing
going
for
eighteen
months
but
hang
it
it
ai
so
vital
any
more
we
simply
could
see
our
way
to
a
new
edition
oh
i
do
say
it
dead
yet
but
it
moribund
and
you
the
only
man
who
can
resuscitate
it
the
professor
continued
to
stare
i
what
can
i
do
about
it
he
stammered
do
why
write
another
like
it
go
it
one
better
you
know
the
trick
the
public
is
tired
of
you
by
any
means
but
you
want
to
make
yourself
heard
again
before
anybody
else
cuts
in
write
another
book
write
two
and
we
sell
them
in
sets
in
a
box
the
vital
thing
series
that
will
take
tremendously
in
the
holidays
try
and
let
us
have
a
new
volume
by
october
i
be
glad
to
give
you
a
big
advance
if
you
sign
a
contract
on
that
the
professor
sat
silent
there
was
too
cruel
an
irony
in
the
coincidence
harviss
looked
up
at
him
in
surprise
well
what
the
matter
with
taking
my
advice
you
not
going
out
of
literature
are
you
the
professor
rose
from
his
chair
no
i
going
into
it
he
said
simply
going
into
it
i
going
to
write
a
real
book
a
serious
one
good
lord
most
people
think
vital
thing
serious
yes
but
i
mean
something
different
in
your
old
line
beetles
and
so
forth
yes
said
the
professor
solemnly
harviss
looked
at
him
with
equal
gravity
well
i
sorry
for
that
he
said
because
it
takes
you
out
of
our
bailiwick
but
i
suppose
you
made
enough
money
out
of
vital
thing
to
permit
yourself
a
little
harmless
amusement
when
you
want
more
cash
come
back
to
us
only
do
put
it
off
too
long
or
some
other
fellow
will
have
stepped
into
your
shoes
popularity
do
keep
you
know
and
the
hotter
the
success
the
quicker
the
commodity
perishes
he
leaned
back
cheerful
and
sententious
delivering
his
axioms
with
conscious
kindliness
the
professor
who
had
risen
and
moved
to
the
door
turned
back
with
a
wavering
step
when
did
you
say
another
volume
would
have
to
be
ready
he
faltered
i
said
october
but
call
it
a
month
later
you
do
need
any
pushing
nowadays
and
you
have
no
objection
to
letting
me
have
a
little
advance
now
i
need
some
new
instruments
for
my
real
work
harviss
extended
a
cordial
hand
my
dear
fellow
that
talking
write
the
cheque
while
you
wait
and
i
daresay
we
can
start
up
the
cheap
edition
of
vital
thing
at
the
same
time
if
you
pledge
yourself
to
give
us
the
book
by
how
much
he
asked
poised
above
his
in
the
street
the
professor
stood
staring
about
him
uncertain
and
a
little
dazed
after
all
it
only
putting
it
off
for
six
months
he
said
to
himself
and
i
can
do
better
work
when
i
get
my
new
instruments
he
smiled
and
raised
his
hat
to
the
passing
victoria
of
a
lady
in
whose
copy
of
the
vital
thing
he
had
recently
written
est
etiam
ipsa
the
other
two
i
waythorn
on
the
hearth
waited
for
his
wife
to
come
down
to
dinner
it
was
their
first
night
under
his
own
roof
and
he
was
surprised
at
his
thrill
of
boyish
agitation
he
was
not
so
old
to
be
sure
his
glass
gave
him
little
more
than
the
years
to
which
his
wife
confessed
but
he
had
fancied
himself
already
in
the
temperate
zone
yet
here
he
was
listening
for
her
step
with
a
tender
sense
of
all
it
symbolized
with
some
old
trail
of
verse
about
the
garlanded
nuptial
floating
through
his
enjoyment
of
the
pleasant
room
and
the
good
dinner
just
beyond
it
they
had
been
hastily
recalled
from
their
honeymoon
by
the
illness
of
lily
haskett
the
child
of
waythorn
first
marriage
the
little
girl
at
waythorn
desire
had
been
transferred
to
his
house
on
the
day
of
her
mother
wedding
and
the
doctor
on
their
arrival
broke
the
news
that
she
was
ill
with
typhoid
but
declared
that
all
the
symptoms
were
favorable
lily
could
show
twelve
years
of
unblemished
health
and
the
case
promised
to
be
a
light
one
the
nurse
spoke
as
reassuringly
and
after
a
moment
of
alarm
waythorn
had
adjusted
herself
to
the
situation
she
was
very
fond
of
lily
her
affection
for
the
child
had
perhaps
been
her
decisive
charm
in
waythorn
eyes
but
she
had
the
perfectly
balanced
nerves
which
her
little
girl
had
inherited
and
no
woman
ever
wasted
less
tissue
in
unproductive
worry
waythorn
was
therefore
quite
prepared
to
see
her
come
in
presently
a
little
late
because
of
a
last
look
at
lily
but
as
serene
and
as
if
her
kiss
had
been
laid
on
the
brow
of
health
her
composure
was
restful
to
him
it
acted
as
ballast
to
his
somewhat
unstable
sensibilities
as
he
pictured
her
bending
over
the
child
bed
he
thought
how
soothing
her
presence
must
be
in
illness
her
very
step
would
prognosticate
recovery
his
own
life
had
been
a
gray
one
from
temperament
rather
than
circumstance
and
he
had
been
drawn
to
her
by
the
unperturbed
gayety
which
kept
her
fresh
and
elastic
at
an
age
when
most
women
activities
are
growing
either
slack
or
febrile
he
knew
what
was
said
about
her
for
popular
as
she
was
there
had
always
been
a
faint
undercurrent
of
detraction
when
she
had
appeared
in
new
york
nine
or
ten
years
earlier
as
the
pretty
haskett
whom
gus
varick
had
unearthed
somewhere
was
it
in
pittsburgh
or
utica
society
while
promptly
accepting
her
had
reserved
the
right
to
cast
a
doubt
on
its
own
discrimination
inquiry
however
established
her
undoubted
connection
with
a
socially
reigning
family
and
explained
her
recent
divorce
as
the
natural
result
of
a
runaway
match
at
seventeen
and
as
nothing
was
known
of
haskett
it
was
easy
to
believe
the
worst
of
him
alice
haskett
remarriage
with
gus
varick
was
a
passport
to
the
set
whose
recognition
she
coveted
and
for
a
few
years
the
varicks
were
the
most
popular
couple
in
town
unfortunately
the
alliance
was
brief
and
stormy
and
this
time
the
husband
had
his
champions
still
even
varick
stanchest
supporters
admitted
that
he
was
not
meant
for
matrimony
and
varick
grievances
were
of
a
nature
to
bear
the
inspection
of
the
new
york
courts
a
new
york
divorce
is
in
itself
a
diploma
of
virtue
and
in
the
of
this
second
separation
varick
took
on
an
air
of
sanctity
and
was
allowed
to
confide
her
wrongs
to
some
of
the
most
scrupulous
ears
in
town
but
when
it
was
known
that
she
was
to
marry
waythorn
there
was
a
momentary
reaction
her
best
friends
would
have
preferred
to
see
her
remain
in
the
role
of
the
injured
wife
which
was
as
becoming
to
her
as
crape
to
a
rosy
complexion
true
a
decent
time
had
elapsed
and
it
was
not
even
suggested
that
waythorn
had
supplanted
his
predecessor
still
people
shook
their
heads
over
him
and
one
grudging
friend
to
whom
he
affirmed
that
he
took
the
step
with
his
eyes
open
replied
oracularly
yes
and
with
your
ears
shut
waythorn
could
afford
to
smile
at
these
innuendoes
in
the
wall
street
phrase
he
had
discounted
them
he
knew
that
society
has
not
yet
adapted
itself
to
the
consequences
of
divorce
and
that
till
the
adaptation
takes
place
every
woman
who
uses
the
freedom
the
law
accords
her
must
be
her
own
social
justification
waythorn
had
an
amused
confidence
in
his
wife
ability
to
justify
herself
his
expectations
were
fulfilled
and
before
the
wedding
took
place
alice
varick
group
had
rallied
openly
to
her
support
she
took
it
all
imperturbably
she
had
a
way
of
surmounting
obstacles
without
seeming
to
be
aware
of
them
and
waythorn
looked
back
with
wonder
at
the
trivialities
over
which
he
had
worn
his
nerves
thin
he
had
the
sense
of
having
found
refuge
in
a
richer
warmer
nature
than
his
own
and
his
satisfaction
at
the
moment
was
humorously
summed
up
in
the
thought
that
his
wife
when
she
had
done
all
she
could
for
lily
would
not
be
ashamed
to
come
down
and
enjoy
a
good
dinner
the
anticipation
of
such
enjoyment
was
not
however
the
sentiment
expressed
by
waythorn
charming
face
when
she
presently
joined
him
though
she
had
put
on
her
most
engaging
teagown
she
had
neglected
to
assume
the
smile
that
went
with
it
and
waythorn
thought
he
had
never
seen
her
look
so
nearly
worried
what
is
it
he
asked
is
anything
wrong
with
lily
no
i
just
been
in
and
she
still
sleeping
waythorn
hesitated
but
something
tiresome
has
happened
he
had
taken
her
two
hands
and
now
perceived
that
he
was
crushing
a
paper
between
them
this
letter
yes
haskett
has
written
i
mean
his
lawyer
has
written
waythorn
felt
himself
flush
uncomfortably
he
dropped
his
wife
hands
what
about
about
seeing
lily
you
know
the
courts
yes
yes
he
interrupted
nervously
nothing
was
known
about
haskett
in
new
york
he
was
vaguely
supposed
to
have
remained
in
the
outer
darkness
from
which
his
wife
had
been
rescued
and
waythorn
was
one
of
the
few
who
were
aware
that
he
had
given
up
his
business
in
utica
and
followed
her
to
new
york
in
order
to
be
near
his
little
girl
in
the
days
of
his
wooing
waythorn
had
often
met
lily
on
the
doorstep
rosy
and
smiling
on
her
way
to
see
papa
i
am
so
sorry
waythorn
murmured
he
roused
himself
what
does
he
want
he
wants
to
see
her
you
know
she
goes
to
him
once
a
week
well
he
does
expect
her
to
go
to
him
now
does
he
no
he
has
heard
of
her
illness
but
he
expects
to
come
here
waythorn
reddened
under
his
gaze
they
looked
away
from
each
other
i
afraid
he
has
the
right
see
she
made
a
proffer
of
the
letter
waythorn
moved
away
with
a
gesture
of
refusal
he
stood
staring
about
the
softly
lighted
room
which
a
moment
before
had
seemed
so
full
of
bridal
intimacy
i
so
sorry
she
repeated
if
lily
could
have
been
moved
that
out
of
the
question
he
returned
impatiently
i
suppose
so
her
lip
was
beginning
to
tremble
and
he
felt
himself
a
brute
he
must
come
of
course
he
said
when
is
his
day
i
afraid
very
well
send
a
note
in
the
morning
the
butler
entered
to
announce
dinner
waythorn
turned
to
his
wife
come
you
must
be
tired
it
beastly
but
try
to
forget
about
it
he
said
drawing
her
hand
through
his
arm
you
so
good
dear
i
try
she
whispered
back
her
face
cleared
at
once
and
as
she
looked
at
him
across
the
flowers
between
the
rosy
he
saw
her
lips
waver
back
into
a
smile
how
pretty
everything
is
she
sighed
luxuriously
he
turned
to
the
butler
the
champagne
at
once
please
waythorn
is
tired
in
a
moment
or
two
their
eyes
met
above
the
sparkling
glasses
her
own
were
quite
clear
and
untroubled
he
saw
that
she
had
obeyed
his
injunction
and
forgotten
ii
waythorn
the
next
morning
went
down
town
earlier
than
usual
haskett
was
not
likely
to
come
till
the
afternoon
but
the
instinct
of
flight
drove
him
forth
he
meant
to
stay
away
all
day
he
had
thoughts
of
dining
at
his
club
as
his
door
closed
behind
him
he
reflected
that
before
he
opened
it
again
it
would
have
admitted
another
man
who
had
as
much
right
to
enter
it
as
himself
and
the
thought
filled
him
with
a
physical
repugnance
he
caught
the
elevated
at
the
employees
hour
and
found
himself
crushed
between
two
layers
of
pendulous
humanity
at
eighth
street
the
man
facing
him
wriggled
out
and
another
took
his
place
waythorn
glanced
up
and
saw
that
it
was
gus
varick
the
men
were
so
close
together
that
it
was
impossible
to
ignore
the
smile
of
recognition
on
varick
handsome
overblown
face
and
after
all
why
not
they
had
always
been
on
good
terms
and
varick
had
been
divorced
before
waythorn
attentions
to
his
wife
began
the
two
exchanged
a
word
on
the
perennial
grievance
of
the
congested
trains
and
when
a
seat
at
their
side
was
miraculously
left
empty
the
instinct
of
made
waythorn
slip
into
it
after
varick
the
latter
drew
the
stout
man
breath
of
relief
lord
i
was
beginning
to
feel
like
a
pressed
flower
he
leaned
back
looking
unconcernedly
at
waythorn
sorry
to
hear
that
sellers
is
knocked
out
again
sellers
echoed
waythorn
starting
at
his
partner
name
varick
looked
surprised
you
did
know
he
was
laid
up
with
the
gout
no
i
been
away
i
only
got
back
last
night
waythorn
felt
himself
reddening
in
anticipation
of
the
other
smile
ah
yes
to
be
sure
and
sellers
attack
came
on
two
days
ago
afraid
he
pretty
bad
very
awkward
for
me
as
it
happens
because
he
was
just
putting
through
a
rather
important
thing
for
me
ah
waythorn
wondered
vaguely
since
when
varick
had
been
dealing
in
important
things
hitherto
he
had
dabbled
only
in
the
shallow
pools
of
speculation
with
which
waythorn
office
did
not
usually
concern
itself
it
occurred
to
him
that
varick
might
be
talking
at
random
to
relieve
the
strain
of
their
propinquity
that
strain
was
becoming
momentarily
more
apparent
to
waythorn
and
when
at
cortlandt
street
he
caught
sight
of
an
acquaintance
and
had
a
sudden
vision
of
the
picture
he
and
varick
must
present
to
an
initiated
eye
he
jumped
up
with
a
muttered
excuse
i
hope
you
find
sellers
better
said
varick
civilly
and
he
stammered
back
if
i
can
be
of
any
use
to
you
and
let
the
departing
crowd
sweep
him
to
the
platform
at
his
office
he
heard
that
sellers
was
in
fact
ill
with
the
gout
and
would
probably
not
be
able
to
leave
the
house
for
some
weeks
i
sorry
it
should
have
happened
so
waythorn
the
senior
clerk
said
with
affable
significance
mr
sellers
was
very
much
upset
at
the
idea
of
giving
you
such
a
lot
of
extra
work
just
now
oh
that
no
matter
said
waythorn
hastily
he
secretly
welcomed
the
pressure
of
additional
business
and
was
glad
to
think
that
when
the
day
work
was
over
he
would
have
to
call
at
his
partner
on
the
way
home
he
was
late
for
luncheon
and
turned
in
at
the
nearest
restaurant
instead
of
going
to
his
club
the
place
was
full
and
the
waiter
hurried
him
to
the
back
of
the
room
to
capture
the
only
vacant
table
in
the
cloud
of
waythorn
did
not
at
once
distinguish
his
neighbors
but
presently
looking
about
him
he
saw
varick
seated
a
few
feet
off
this
time
luckily
they
were
too
far
apart
for
conversation
and
varick
who
faced
another
way
had
probably
not
even
seen
him
but
there
was
an
irony
in
their
renewed
nearness
varick
was
said
to
be
fond
of
good
living
and
as
waythorn
sat
despatching
his
hurried
luncheon
he
looked
across
half
enviously
at
the
other
leisurely
degustation
of
his
meal
when
waythorn
first
saw
him
he
had
been
helping
himself
with
critical
deliberation
to
a
bit
of
camembert
at
the
ideal
point
of
liquefaction
and
now
the
cheese
removed
he
was
just
pouring
his
from
its
little
earthen
pot
he
poured
slowly
his
ruddy
profile
bent
above
the
task
and
one
beringed
white
hand
steadying
the
lid
of
the
then
he
stretched
his
other
hand
to
the
decanter
of
cognac
at
his
elbow
filled
a
took
a
tentative
sip
and
poured
the
brandy
into
his
waythorn
watched
him
in
a
kind
of
fascination
what
was
he
thinking
of
only
of
the
flavor
of
the
coffee
and
the
liqueur
had
the
meeting
left
no
more
trace
in
his
thoughts
than
on
his
face
had
his
wife
so
completely
passed
out
of
his
life
that
even
this
odd
encounter
with
her
present
husband
within
a
week
after
her
remarriage
was
no
more
than
an
incident
in
his
day
and
as
waythorn
mused
another
idea
struck
him
had
haskett
ever
met
varick
as
varick
and
he
had
just
met
the
recollection
of
haskett
perturbed
him
and
he
rose
and
left
the
restaurant
taking
a
circuitous
way
out
to
escape
the
placid
irony
of
varick
nod
it
was
after
seven
when
waythorn
reached
home
he
thought
the
footman
who
opened
the
door
looked
at
him
oddly
how
is
miss
lily
he
asked
in
haste
doing
very
well
sir
a
gentleman
tell
barlow
to
put
off
dinner
for
half
an
hour
waythorn
cut
him
off
hurrying
upstairs
he
went
straight
to
his
room
and
dressed
without
seeing
his
wife
when
he
reached
the
she
was
there
fresh
and
radiant
day
had
been
good
the
doctor
was
not
coming
back
that
evening
at
dinner
waythorn
told
her
of
sellers
illness
and
of
the
resulting
complications
she
listened
sympathetically
adjuring
him
not
to
let
himself
be
overworked
and
asking
vague
feminine
questions
about
the
routine
of
the
office
then
she
gave
him
the
chronicle
of
lily
day
quoted
the
nurse
and
doctor
and
told
him
who
had
called
to
inquire
he
had
never
seen
her
more
serene
and
unruffled
it
struck
him
with
a
curious
pang
that
she
was
very
happy
in
being
with
him
so
happy
that
she
found
a
childish
pleasure
in
rehearsing
the
trivial
incidents
of
her
day
after
dinner
they
went
to
the
library
and
the
servant
put
the
coffee
and
liqueurs
on
a
low
table
before
her
and
left
the
room
she
looked
singularly
soft
and
girlish
in
her
rosy
pale
dress
against
the
dark
leather
of
one
of
his
bachelor
armchairs
a
day
earlier
the
contrast
would
have
charmed
him
he
turned
away
now
choosing
a
cigar
with
affected
deliberation
did
haskett
come
he
asked
with
his
back
to
her
oh
yes
he
came
you
did
see
him
of
course
she
hesitated
a
moment
i
let
the
nurse
see
him
that
was
all
there
was
nothing
more
to
ask
he
swung
round
toward
her
applying
a
match
to
his
cigar
well
the
thing
was
over
for
a
week
at
any
rate
he
would
try
not
to
think
of
it
she
looked
up
at
him
a
trifle
rosier
than
usual
with
a
smile
in
her
eyes
ready
for
your
coffee
dear
he
leaned
against
the
mantelpiece
watching
her
as
she
lifted
the
the
lamplight
struck
a
gleam
from
her
bracelets
and
tipped
her
soft
hair
with
brightness
how
light
and
slender
she
was
and
how
each
gesture
flowed
into
the
next
she
seemed
a
creature
all
compact
of
harmonies
as
the
thought
of
haskett
receded
waythorn
felt
himself
yielding
again
to
the
joy
of
possessorship
they
were
his
those
white
hands
with
their
flitting
motions
his
the
light
haze
of
hair
the
lips
and
eyes
she
set
down
the
and
reaching
for
the
decanter
of
cognac
measured
off
a
and
poured
it
into
his
cup
waythorn
uttered
a
sudden
exclamation
what
is
the
matter
she
said
startled
nothing
only
i
do
take
cognac
in
my
coffee
oh
how
stupid
of
me
she
cried
their
eyes
met
and
she
blushed
a
sudden
agonized
red
iii
ten
days
later
mr
sellers
still
asked
waythorn
to
call
on
his
way
down
town
the
senior
partner
with
his
swaddled
foot
propped
up
by
the
fire
greeted
his
associate
with
an
air
of
embarrassment
i
sorry
my
dear
fellow
i
got
to
ask
you
to
do
an
awkward
thing
for
me
waythorn
waited
and
the
other
went
on
after
a
pause
apparently
given
to
the
arrangement
of
his
phrases
the
fact
is
when
i
was
knocked
out
i
had
just
gone
into
a
rather
complicated
piece
of
business
for
gus
varick
well
said
waythorn
with
an
attempt
to
put
him
at
his
ease
well
it
this
way
varick
came
to
me
the
day
before
my
attack
he
had
evidently
had
an
inside
tip
from
somebody
and
had
made
about
a
hundred
thousand
he
came
to
me
for
advice
and
i
suggested
his
going
in
with
vanderlyn
oh
the
deuce
waythorn
exclaimed
he
saw
in
a
flash
what
had
happened
the
investment
was
an
alluring
one
but
required
negotiation
he
listened
intently
while
sellers
put
the
case
before
him
and
the
statement
ended
he
said
you
think
i
ought
to
see
varick
i
afraid
i
ca
as
yet
the
doctor
is
obdurate
and
this
thing
ca
wait
i
hate
to
ask
you
but
no
one
else
in
the
office
knows
the
ins
and
outs
of
it
waythorn
stood
silent
he
did
not
care
a
farthing
for
the
success
of
varick
venture
but
the
honor
of
the
office
was
to
be
considered
and
he
could
hardly
refuse
to
oblige
his
partner
very
well
he
said
i
do
it
that
afternoon
apprised
by
telephone
varick
called
at
the
office
waythorn
waiting
in
his
private
room
wondered
what
the
others
thought
of
it
the
newspapers
at
the
time
of
waythorn
marriage
had
acquainted
their
readers
with
every
detail
of
her
previous
matrimonial
ventures
and
waythorn
could
fancy
the
clerks
smiling
behind
back
as
he
was
ushered
in
varick
bore
himself
admirably
he
was
easy
without
being
undignified
and
waythorn
was
conscious
of
cutting
a
much
less
impressive
figure
varick
had
no
head
for
business
and
the
talk
prolonged
itself
for
nearly
an
hour
while
waythorn
set
forth
with
scrupulous
precision
the
details
of
the
proposed
transaction
i
awfully
obliged
to
you
varick
said
as
he
rose
the
fact
is
not
used
to
having
much
money
to
look
after
and
i
do
want
to
make
an
ass
of
myself
he
smiled
and
waythorn
could
not
help
noticing
that
there
was
something
pleasant
about
his
smile
it
feels
uncommonly
queer
to
have
enough
cash
to
pay
one
bills
i
have
sold
my
soul
for
it
a
few
years
ago
waythorn
winced
at
the
allusion
he
had
heard
it
rumored
that
a
lack
of
funds
had
been
one
of
the
determining
causes
of
the
varick
separation
but
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
varick
words
were
intentional
it
seemed
more
likely
that
the
desire
to
keep
clear
of
embarrassing
topics
had
fatally
drawn
him
into
one
waythorn
did
not
wish
to
be
outdone
in
civility
we
do
the
best
we
can
for
you
he
said
i
think
this
is
a
good
thing
you
in
oh
i
sure
it
immense
it
awfully
good
of
you
varick
broke
off
embarrassed
i
suppose
the
thing
settled
now
but
if
if
anything
happens
before
sellers
is
about
i
see
you
again
said
waythorn
quietly
he
was
glad
in
the
end
to
appear
the
more
of
the
two
the
course
of
lily
illness
ran
smooth
and
as
the
days
passed
waythorn
grew
used
to
the
idea
of
haskett
weekly
visit
the
first
time
the
day
came
round
he
stayed
out
late
and
questioned
his
wife
as
to
the
visit
on
his
return
she
replied
at
once
that
haskett
had
merely
seen
the
nurse
downstairs
as
the
doctor
did
not
wish
any
one
in
the
child
till
after
the
crisis
the
following
week
waythorn
was
again
conscious
of
the
recurrence
of
the
day
but
had
forgotten
it
by
the
time
he
came
home
to
dinner
the
crisis
of
the
disease
came
a
few
days
later
with
a
rapid
decline
of
fever
and
the
little
girl
was
pronounced
out
of
danger
in
the
rejoicing
which
ensued
the
thought
of
haskett
passed
out
of
mind
and
one
afternoon
letting
himself
into
the
house
with
a
latchkey
he
went
straight
to
his
library
without
noticing
a
shabby
hat
and
umbrella
in
the
hall
in
the
library
he
found
a
small
man
with
a
thinnish
gray
beard
sitting
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
the
stranger
might
have
been
a
or
one
of
those
mysteriously
efficient
persons
who
are
summoned
in
emergencies
to
adjust
some
detail
of
the
domestic
machinery
he
blinked
at
waythorn
through
a
pair
of
spectacles
and
said
mildly
waythorn
i
presume
i
am
father
waythorn
flushed
oh
he
stammered
uncomfortably
he
broke
off
disliking
to
appear
rude
inwardly
he
was
trying
to
adjust
the
actual
haskett
to
the
image
of
him
projected
by
his
wife
reminiscences
waythorn
had
been
allowed
to
infer
that
alice
first
husband
was
a
brute
i
am
sorry
to
intrude
said
haskett
with
his
politeness
do
mention
it
returned
waythorn
collecting
himself
i
suppose
the
nurse
has
been
told
i
presume
so
i
can
wait
said
haskett
he
had
a
resigned
way
of
speaking
as
though
life
had
worn
down
his
natural
powers
of
resistance
waythorn
stood
on
the
threshold
nervously
pulling
off
his
gloves
i
sorry
you
been
detained
i
will
send
for
the
nurse
he
said
and
as
he
opened
the
door
he
added
with
an
effort
i
glad
we
can
give
you
a
good
report
of
lily
he
winced
as
the
slipped
out
but
haskett
seemed
not
to
notice
it
thank
you
waythorn
it
been
an
anxious
time
for
me
ah
well
that
past
soon
she
be
able
to
go
to
you
waythorn
nodded
and
passed
out
in
his
own
room
he
flung
himself
down
with
a
groan
he
hated
the
womanish
sensibility
which
made
him
suffer
so
acutely
from
the
grotesque
chances
of
life
he
had
known
when
he
married
that
his
former
husbands
were
both
living
and
that
amid
the
multiplied
contacts
of
modern
existence
there
were
a
thousand
chances
to
one
that
he
would
run
against
one
or
the
other
yet
he
found
himself
as
much
disturbed
by
his
brief
encounter
with
haskett
as
though
the
law
had
not
obligingly
removed
all
difficulties
in
the
way
of
their
meeting
waythorn
sprang
up
and
began
to
pace
the
room
nervously
he
had
not
suffered
half
so
much
from
his
two
meetings
with
varick
it
was
haskett
presence
in
his
own
house
that
made
the
situation
so
intolerable
he
stood
still
hearing
steps
in
the
passage
this
way
please
he
heard
the
nurse
say
haskett
was
being
taken
upstairs
then
not
a
corner
of
the
house
but
was
open
to
him
waythorn
dropped
into
another
chair
staring
vaguely
ahead
of
him
on
his
stood
a
photograph
of
alice
taken
when
he
had
first
known
her
she
was
alice
varick
then
how
fine
and
exquisite
he
had
thought
her
those
were
varick
pearls
about
her
neck
at
instance
they
had
been
returned
before
her
marriage
had
haskett
ever
given
her
any
trinkets
and
what
had
become
of
them
waythorn
wondered
he
realized
suddenly
that
he
knew
very
little
of
haskett
past
or
present
situation
but
from
the
man
appearance
and
manner
of
speech
he
could
reconstruct
with
curious
precision
the
surroundings
of
first
marriage
and
it
startled
him
to
think
that
she
had
in
the
background
of
her
life
a
phase
of
existence
so
different
from
anything
with
which
he
had
connected
her
varick
whatever
his
faults
was
a
gentleman
in
the
conventional
traditional
sense
of
the
term
the
sense
which
at
that
moment
seemed
oddly
enough
to
have
most
meaning
to
waythorn
he
and
varick
had
the
same
social
habits
spoke
the
same
language
understood
the
same
allusions
but
this
other
man
it
was
grotesquely
uppermost
in
waythorn
mind
that
haskett
had
worn
a
tie
attached
with
an
elastic
why
should
that
ridiculous
detail
symbolize
the
whole
man
waythorn
was
exasperated
by
his
own
paltriness
but
the
fact
of
the
tie
expanded
forced
itself
on
him
became
as
it
were
the
key
to
alice
past
he
could
see
her
as
haskett
sitting
in
a
front
parlor
furnished
in
plush
with
a
pianola
and
a
copy
of
ben
hur
on
the
he
could
see
her
going
to
the
theatre
with
haskett
or
perhaps
even
to
a
church
sociable
she
in
a
picture
hat
and
haskett
in
a
black
a
little
creased
with
the
tie
on
an
elastic
on
the
way
home
they
would
stop
and
look
at
the
illuminated
lingering
over
the
photographs
of
new
york
actresses
on
sunday
afternoons
haskett
would
take
her
for
a
walk
pushing
lily
ahead
of
them
in
a
white
enameled
perambulator
and
waythorn
had
a
vision
of
the
people
they
would
stop
and
talk
to
he
could
fancy
how
pretty
alice
must
have
looked
in
a
dress
adroitly
constructed
from
the
hints
of
a
new
york
how
she
must
have
looked
down
on
the
other
women
chafing
at
her
life
and
secretly
feeling
that
she
belonged
in
a
bigger
place
for
the
moment
his
foremost
thought
was
one
of
wonder
at
the
way
in
which
she
had
shed
the
phase
of
existence
which
her
marriage
with
haskett
implied
it
was
as
if
her
whole
aspect
every
gesture
every
inflection
every
allusion
were
a
studied
negation
of
that
period
of
her
life
if
she
had
denied
being
married
to
haskett
she
could
hardly
have
stood
more
convicted
of
duplicity
than
in
this
obliteration
of
the
self
which
had
been
his
wife
waythorn
started
up
checking
himself
in
the
analysis
of
her
motives
what
right
had
he
to
create
a
fantastic
effigy
of
her
and
then
pass
judgment
on
it
she
had
spoken
vaguely
of
her
first
marriage
as
unhappy
had
hinted
with
becoming
reticence
that
haskett
had
wrought
havoc
among
her
young
illusions
was
a
pity
for
waythorn
peace
of
mind
that
haskett
very
inoffensiveness
shed
a
new
light
on
the
nature
of
those
illusions
a
man
would
rather
think
that
his
wife
has
been
brutalized
by
her
first
husband
than
that
the
process
has
been
reversed
why
how
do
you
do
she
said
with
a
distinct
note
of
pleasure
iv
waythorn
i
do
like
that
french
governess
of
lily
haskett
subdued
and
apologetic
stood
before
waythorn
in
the
library
revolving
his
shabby
hat
in
his
hand
waythorn
surprised
in
his
armchair
over
the
evening
paper
stared
back
perplexedly
at
his
visitor
you
excuse
my
asking
to
see
you
haskett
continued
but
this
is
my
last
visit
and
i
thought
if
i
could
have
a
word
with
you
it
would
be
a
better
way
than
writing
to
waythorn
lawyer
waythorn
rose
uneasily
he
did
not
like
the
french
governess
either
but
that
was
irrelevant
i
am
not
so
sure
of
that
he
returned
stiffly
but
since
you
wish
it
i
will
give
your
message
to
my
wife
he
always
hesitated
over
the
possessive
pronoun
in
addressing
haskett
the
latter
sighed
i
do
know
as
that
will
help
much
she
like
it
when
i
spoke
to
her
waythorn
turned
red
when
did
you
see
her
he
asked
not
since
the
first
day
i
came
to
see
lily
right
after
she
was
taken
sick
i
remarked
to
her
then
that
i
did
like
the
governess
waythorn
made
no
answer
he
remembered
distinctly
that
after
that
first
visit
he
had
asked
his
wife
if
she
had
seen
haskett
she
had
lied
to
him
then
but
she
had
respected
his
wishes
since
and
the
incident
cast
a
curious
light
on
her
character
he
was
sure
she
would
not
have
seen
haskett
that
first
day
if
she
had
divined
that
waythorn
would
object
and
the
fact
that
she
did
not
divine
it
was
almost
as
disagreeable
to
the
latter
as
the
discovery
that
she
had
lied
to
him
i
do
like
the
woman
haskett
was
repeating
with
mild
persistency
she
ai
straight
waythorn
she
teach
the
child
to
be
underhand
i
noticed
a
change
in
lily
she
too
anxious
to
please
and
she
do
always
tell
the
truth
she
used
to
be
the
straightest
child
waythorn
he
broke
off
his
voice
a
little
thick
not
but
what
i
want
her
to
have
a
stylish
education
he
ended
waythorn
was
touched
i
sorry
haskett
but
frankly
i
quite
see
what
i
can
do
haskett
hesitated
then
he
laid
his
hat
on
the
table
and
advanced
to
the
on
which
waythorn
was
standing
there
was
nothing
aggressive
in
his
manner
but
he
had
the
solemnity
of
a
timid
man
resolved
on
a
decisive
measure
there
just
one
thing
you
can
do
waythorn
he
said
you
can
remind
waythorn
that
by
the
decree
of
the
courts
i
am
entitled
to
have
a
voice
in
lily
bringing
up
he
paused
and
went
on
more
deprecatingly
i
not
the
kind
to
talk
about
enforcing
my
rights
waythorn
i
do
know
as
i
think
a
man
is
entitled
to
rights
he
known
how
to
hold
on
to
but
this
business
of
the
child
is
different
i
never
let
go
there
and
i
never
mean
to
the
scene
left
waythorn
deeply
shaken
shamefacedly
in
indirect
ways
he
had
been
finding
out
about
haskett
and
all
that
he
had
learned
was
favorable
the
little
man
in
order
to
be
near
his
daughter
had
sold
out
his
share
in
a
profitable
business
in
utica
and
accepted
a
modest
clerkship
in
a
new
york
manufacturing
house
he
boarded
in
a
shabby
street
and
had
few
acquaintances
his
passion
for
lily
filled
his
life
waythorn
felt
that
this
exploration
of
haskett
was
like
groping
about
with
a
in
his
wife
past
but
he
saw
now
that
there
were
recesses
his
lantern
had
not
explored
he
had
never
inquired
into
the
exact
circumstances
of
his
wife
first
matrimonial
rupture
on
the
surface
all
had
been
fair
it
was
she
who
had
obtained
the
divorce
and
the
court
had
given
her
the
child
but
waythorn
knew
how
many
ambiguities
such
a
verdict
might
cover
the
mere
fact
that
haskett
retained
a
right
over
his
daughter
implied
an
unsuspected
compromise
waythorn
was
an
idealist
he
always
refused
to
recognize
unpleasant
contingencies
till
he
found
himself
confronted
with
them
and
then
he
saw
them
followed
by
a
special
train
of
consequences
his
next
days
were
thus
haunted
and
he
determined
to
try
to
lay
the
ghosts
by
conjuring
them
up
in
his
wife
presence
when
he
repeated
haskett
request
a
flame
of
anger
passed
over
her
face
but
she
subdued
it
instantly
and
spoke
with
a
slight
quiver
of
outraged
motherhood
it
is
very
ungentlemanly
of
him
she
said
the
word
grated
on
waythorn
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
it
a
bare
question
of
rights
she
murmured
it
not
as
if
he
could
ever
be
a
help
to
lily
waythorn
flushed
this
was
even
less
to
his
taste
the
question
is
he
repeated
what
authority
has
he
over
her
she
looked
downward
twisting
herself
a
little
in
her
seat
i
am
willing
to
see
him
i
thought
you
objected
she
faltered
in
a
flash
he
understood
that
she
knew
the
extent
of
haskett
claims
perhaps
it
was
not
the
first
time
she
had
resisted
them
my
objecting
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
he
said
coldly
if
haskett
has
a
right
to
be
consulted
you
must
consult
him
she
burst
into
tears
and
he
saw
that
she
expected
him
to
regard
her
as
a
victim
haskett
did
not
abuse
his
rights
waythorn
had
felt
miserably
sure
that
he
would
not
but
the
governess
was
dismissed
and
from
time
to
time
the
little
man
demanded
an
interview
with
alice
after
the
first
outburst
she
accepted
the
situation
with
her
usual
adaptability
haskett
had
once
reminded
waythorn
of
the
and
waythorn
after
a
month
or
two
appeared
to
class
him
with
that
domestic
familiar
waythorn
could
not
but
respect
the
tenacity
at
first
he
had
tried
to
cultivate
the
suspicion
that
haskett
might
be
up
to
something
that
he
had
an
object
in
securing
a
foothold
in
the
house
but
in
his
heart
waythorn
was
sure
of
he
even
guessed
in
the
latter
a
mild
contempt
for
such
advantages
as
his
relation
with
the
waythorns
might
offer
haskett
sincerity
of
purpose
made
him
invulnerable
and
his
successor
had
to
accept
him
as
a
lien
on
the
property
mr
sellers
was
sent
to
europe
to
recover
from
his
gout
and
affairs
hung
on
waythorn
hands
the
negotiations
were
prolonged
and
complicated
they
necessitated
frequent
conferences
between
the
two
men
and
the
interests
of
the
firm
forbade
waythorn
suggesting
that
his
client
should
transfer
his
business
to
another
office
varick
appeared
well
in
the
transaction
in
moments
of
relaxation
his
coarse
streak
appeared
and
waythorn
dreaded
his
geniality
but
in
the
office
he
was
concise
and
with
a
flattering
deference
to
waythorn
judgment
their
business
relations
being
so
affably
established
it
would
have
been
absurd
for
the
two
men
to
ignore
each
other
in
society
the
first
time
they
met
in
a
varick
took
up
their
intercourse
in
the
same
easy
key
and
his
grateful
glance
obliged
waythorn
to
respond
to
it
after
that
they
ran
across
each
other
frequently
and
one
evening
at
a
ball
waythorn
wandering
through
the
remoter
rooms
came
upon
varick
seated
beside
his
wife
she
colored
a
little
and
faltered
in
what
she
was
saying
but
varick
nodded
to
waythorn
without
rising
and
the
latter
strolled
on
in
the
carriage
on
the
way
home
he
broke
out
nervously
i
know
you
spoke
to
varick
her
voice
trembled
a
little
it
the
first
time
he
happened
to
be
standing
near
me
i
did
know
what
to
do
it
so
awkward
meeting
everywhere
and
he
said
you
had
been
very
kind
about
some
business
that
different
said
waythorn
she
paused
a
moment
i
do
just
as
you
wish
she
returned
pliantly
i
thought
it
would
be
less
awkward
to
speak
to
him
when
we
meet
her
pliancy
was
beginning
to
sicken
him
had
she
really
no
will
of
her
own
no
theory
about
her
relation
to
these
men
she
had
accepted
haskett
did
she
mean
to
accept
varick
it
was
less
awkward
as
she
had
said
and
her
instinct
was
to
evade
difficulties
or
to
circumvent
them
with
sudden
vividness
waythorn
saw
how
the
instinct
had
developed
she
was
as
easy
as
an
old
shoe
a
shoe
that
too
many
feet
had
worn
her
elasticity
was
the
result
of
tension
in
too
many
different
directions
alice
haskett
alice
varick
alice
waythorn
she
had
been
each
in
turn
and
had
left
hanging
to
each
name
a
little
of
her
privacy
a
little
of
her
personality
a
little
of
the
inmost
self
where
the
unknown
god
abides
yes
it
better
to
speak
to
varick
said
waythorn
wearily
earth
martyrs
by
stephen
phillips
v
the
winter
wore
on
and
society
took
advantage
of
the
acceptance
of
varick
harassed
hostesses
were
grateful
to
them
for
bridging
over
a
social
difficulty
and
waythorn
was
held
up
as
a
miracle
of
good
taste
some
experimental
spirits
could
not
resist
the
diversion
of
throwing
varick
and
his
former
wife
together
and
there
were
those
who
thought
he
found
a
zest
in
the
propinquity
but
waythorn
conduct
remained
irreproachable
she
neither
avoided
varick
nor
sought
him
out
even
waythorn
could
not
but
admit
that
she
had
discovered
the
solution
of
the
newest
social
problem
he
had
married
her
without
giving
much
thought
to
that
problem
he
had
fancied
that
a
woman
can
shed
her
past
like
a
man
but
now
he
saw
that
alice
was
bound
to
hers
both
by
the
circumstances
which
forced
her
into
continued
relation
with
it
and
by
the
traces
it
had
left
on
her
nature
with
grim
irony
waythorn
compared
himself
to
a
member
of
a
syndicate
he
held
so
many
shares
in
his
wife
personality
and
his
predecessors
were
his
partners
in
the
business
if
there
had
been
any
element
of
passion
in
the
transaction
he
would
have
felt
less
deteriorated
by
it
the
fact
that
alice
took
her
change
of
husbands
like
a
change
of
weather
reduced
the
situation
to
mediocrity
he
could
have
forgiven
her
for
blunders
for
excesses
for
resisting
hackett
for
yielding
to
varick
for
anything
but
her
acquiescence
and
her
tact
she
reminded
him
of
a
juggler
tossing
knives
but
the
knives
were
blunt
and
she
knew
they
would
never
cut
her
and
then
gradually
habit
formed
a
protecting
surface
for
his
sensibilities
if
he
paid
for
each
day
comfort
with
the
small
change
of
his
illusions
he
grew
daily
to
value
the
comfort
more
and
set
less
store
upon
the
coin
he
had
drifted
into
a
dulling
propinquity
with
haskett
and
varick
and
he
took
refuge
in
the
cheap
revenge
of
satirizing
the
situation
he
even
began
to
reckon
up
the
advantages
which
accrued
from
it
to
ask
himself
if
it
were
not
better
to
own
a
third
of
a
wife
who
knew
how
to
make
a
man
happy
than
a
whole
one
who
had
lacked
opportunity
to
acquire
the
art
for
it
an
art
and
made
up
like
all
others
of
concessions
eliminations
and
embellishments
of
lights
judiciously
thrown
and
shadows
skillfully
softened
his
wife
knew
exactly
how
to
manage
the
lights
and
he
knew
exactly
to
what
training
she
owed
her
skill
he
even
tried
to
trace
the
source
of
his
obligations
to
discriminate
between
the
influences
which
had
combined
to
produce
his
domestic
happiness
he
perceived
that
haskett
commonness
had
made
alice
worship
good
breeding
while
varick
liberal
construction
of
the
marriage
bond
had
taught
her
to
value
the
conjugal
virtues
so
that
he
was
directly
indebted
to
his
predecessors
for
the
devotion
which
made
his
life
easy
if
not
inspiring
from
this
phase
he
passed
into
that
of
complete
acceptance
he
ceased
to
satirize
himself
because
time
dulled
the
irony
of
the
situation
and
the
joke
lost
its
humor
with
its
sting
even
the
sight
of
haskett
hat
on
the
hall
table
had
ceased
to
touch
the
springs
of
epigram
the
hat
was
often
seen
there
now
for
it
had
been
decided
that
it
was
better
for
lily
father
to
visit
her
than
for
the
little
girl
to
go
to
his
waythorn
having
acquiesced
in
this
arrangement
had
been
surprised
to
find
how
little
difference
it
made
haskett
was
never
obtrusive
and
the
few
visitors
who
met
him
on
the
stairs
were
unaware
of
his
identity
waythorn
did
not
know
how
often
he
saw
alice
but
with
himself
haskett
was
seldom
in
contact
one
afternoon
however
he
learned
on
entering
that
lily
father
was
waiting
to
see
him
in
the
library
he
found
haskett
occupying
a
chair
in
his
usual
provisional
way
waythorn
always
felt
grateful
to
him
for
not
leaning
back
i
hope
you
excuse
me
waythorn
he
said
rising
i
wanted
to
see
waythorn
about
lily
and
your
man
asked
me
to
wait
here
till
she
came
in
of
course
said
waythorn
remembering
that
a
sudden
leak
had
that
morning
given
over
the
to
the
plumbers
he
opened
his
and
held
it
out
to
his
visitor
and
acceptance
seemed
to
mark
a
fresh
stage
in
their
intercourse
the
spring
evening
was
chilly
and
waythorn
invited
his
guest
to
draw
up
his
chair
to
the
fire
he
meant
to
find
an
excuse
to
leave
haskett
in
a
moment
but
he
was
tired
and
cold
and
after
all
the
little
man
no
longer
jarred
on
him
the
two
were
inclosed
in
the
intimacy
of
their
blended
when
the
door
opened
and
varick
walked
into
the
room
waythorn
rose
abruptly
it
was
the
first
time
that
varick
had
come
to
the
house
and
the
surprise
of
seeing
him
combined
with
the
singular
inopportuneness
of
his
arrival
gave
a
new
edge
to
waythorn
blunted
sensibilities
he
stared
at
his
visitor
without
speaking
varick
seemed
too
preoccupied
to
notice
his
host
embarrassment
my
dear
fellow
he
exclaimed
in
his
most
expansive
tone
i
must
apologize
for
tumbling
in
on
you
in
this
way
but
i
was
too
late
to
catch
you
down
town
and
so
i
thought
he
stopped
short
catching
sight
of
haskett
and
his
sanguine
color
deepened
to
a
flush
which
spread
vividly
under
his
scant
blond
hair
but
in
a
moment
he
recovered
himself
and
nodded
slightly
haskett
returned
the
bow
in
silence
and
waythorn
was
still
groping
for
speech
when
the
footman
came
in
carrying
a
the
intrusion
offered
a
welcome
vent
to
waythorn
nerves
what
the
deuce
are
you
bringing
this
here
for
he
said
sharply
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
but
the
plumbers
are
still
in
the
and
waythorn
said
she
would
have
tea
in
the
library
the
footman
perfectly
respectful
tone
implied
a
reflection
on
waythorn
reasonableness
oh
very
well
said
the
latter
resignedly
and
the
footman
proceeded
to
open
the
folding
and
set
out
its
complicated
appointments
while
this
interminable
process
continued
the
three
men
stood
motionless
watching
it
with
a
fascinated
stare
till
waythorn
to
break
the
silence
said
to
varick
wo
you
have
a
cigar
he
held
out
the
case
he
had
just
tendered
to
haskett
and
varick
helped
himself
with
a
smile
waythorn
looked
about
for
a
match
and
finding
none
proffered
a
light
from
his
own
cigar
haskett
in
the
background
held
his
ground
mildly
examining
his
now
and
then
and
stepping
forward
at
the
right
moment
to
knock
its
ashes
into
the
fire
the
footman
at
last
withdrew
and
varick
immediately
began
if
i
could
just
say
half
a
word
to
you
about
this
business
certainly
stammered
waythorn
in
the
but
as
he
placed
his
hand
on
the
door
it
opened
from
without
and
his
wife
appeared
on
the
threshold
she
came
in
fresh
and
smiling
in
her
street
dress
and
hat
shedding
a
fragrance
from
the
boa
which
she
loosened
in
advancing
shall
we
have
tea
in
here
dear
she
began
and
then
she
caught
sight
of
varick
her
smile
deepened
veiling
a
slight
tremor
of
surprise
why
how
do
you
do
she
said
with
a
distinct
note
of
pleasure
as
she
shook
hands
with
varick
she
saw
haskett
standing
behind
him
her
smile
faded
for
a
moment
but
she
recalled
it
quickly
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
at
waythorn
how
do
you
do
mr
haskett
she
said
and
shook
hands
with
him
a
shade
less
cordially
the
three
men
stood
awkwardly
before
her
till
varick
always
the
most
dashed
into
an
explanatory
phrase
we
i
had
to
see
waythorn
a
moment
on
business
he
stammered
from
chin
to
nape
haskett
stepped
forward
with
his
air
of
mild
obstinacy
i
am
sorry
to
intrude
but
you
appointed
five
he
directed
his
resigned
glance
to
the
on
the
mantel
she
swept
aside
their
embarrassment
with
a
charming
gesture
of
hospitality
i
so
sorry
i
always
late
but
the
afternoon
was
so
lovely
she
stood
drawing
her
gloves
off
propitiatory
and
graceful
diffusing
about
her
a
sense
of
ease
and
familiarity
in
which
the
situation
lost
its
grotesqueness
but
before
talking
business
she
added
brightly
i
sure
every
one
wants
a
cup
of
tea
she
dropped
into
her
low
chair
by
the
and
the
two
visitors
as
if
drawn
by
her
smile
advanced
to
receive
the
cups
she
held
out
she
glanced
about
for
waythorn
and
he
took
the
third
cup
with
a
laugh
expiation
i
i
can
never
said
fetherel
hear
the
bell
ring
without
a
shudder
her
unruffled
aspect
she
was
the
kind
of
woman
whose
emotions
never
communicate
themselves
to
her
clothes
and
the
conventional
background
of
the
new
york
with
its
pervading
implication
of
an
imminent
and
of
an
atmosphere
in
which
the
social
functions
have
become
purely
reflex
lent
to
her
declaration
a
relief
not
lost
on
her
cousin
clinch
who
from
the
other
side
of
the
fireplace
agreed
with
a
glance
at
the
clock
that
it
the
hour
for
bores
bores
cried
fetherel
impatiently
if
i
shuddered
at
i
should
have
a
chronic
ague
she
leaned
forward
and
laid
a
sparkling
finger
on
her
cousin
shabby
black
knee
i
mean
the
newspaper
clippings
she
whispered
clinch
returned
a
glance
of
intelligence
they
begun
already
not
yet
but
they
sure
to
now
at
any
minute
my
publisher
tells
me
fetherel
look
of
apprehension
sat
oddly
on
her
small
features
which
had
an
air
of
neat
symmetry
somehow
suggestive
of
being
set
in
order
every
morning
by
the
housemaid
some
one
there
were
rumors
that
it
was
her
cousin
had
once
said
that
paula
fetherel
would
have
been
very
pretty
if
she
had
looked
so
like
a
moral
axiom
in
a
hand
clinch
received
her
confidence
with
a
smile
well
she
said
i
suppose
you
were
prepared
for
the
consequences
of
authorship
fetherel
blushed
brightly
it
is
their
coming
she
owned
it
their
coming
now
the
bishop
in
town
clinch
leaned
back
and
shaped
her
lips
to
a
whistle
which
deflected
in
a
laugh
well
she
said
you
see
fetherel
triumphed
well
were
you
prepared
for
the
bishop
not
now
at
least
i
had
thought
of
his
seeing
the
clippings
and
why
should
he
see
them
bella
you
understand
it
john
john
who
has
taken
the
most
unexpected
tone
one
might
almost
say
out
of
perversity
oh
perversity
clinch
murmured
observing
her
cousin
between
lids
wrinkled
by
amusement
what
tone
has
john
taken
fetherel
threw
out
her
answer
with
the
desperate
gesture
of
a
woman
who
lays
bare
the
traces
of
a
marital
fist
the
tone
of
being
proud
of
my
book
the
measure
of
clinch
enjoyment
overflowed
in
laughter
oh
you
may
laugh
fetherel
insisted
but
it
no
joke
to
me
in
the
first
place
john
liking
the
book
is
so
so
such
a
false
note
it
puts
me
in
such
a
ridiculous
position
and
then
it
has
set
him
watching
for
the
reviews
who
would
ever
have
suspected
john
of
knowing
that
books
were
why
he
actually
found
out
about
the
clipping
bureau
and
whenever
the
postman
rings
i
hear
john
rush
out
of
the
library
to
see
if
there
are
any
yellow
envelopes
of
course
when
they
come
he
bring
them
into
the
and
read
them
aloud
to
everybody
who
happens
to
be
here
and
the
bishop
is
sure
to
happen
to
be
here
clinch
repressed
her
amusement
the
picture
you
draw
is
a
lurid
one
she
conceded
but
your
modesty
strikes
me
as
abnormal
especially
in
an
author
the
chances
are
that
some
of
the
clippings
will
be
rather
pleasant
reading
the
critics
are
not
all
union
men
fetherel
stared
union
men
well
i
mean
they
do
all
belong
to
the
some
of
them
have
even
been
known
to
defy
its
regulations
and
say
a
good
word
for
a
new
writer
oh
i
dare
say
said
fetherel
with
the
laugh
her
epigram
exacted
but
you
do
quite
see
my
point
i
not
at
all
nervous
about
the
success
of
my
book
my
publisher
tells
me
i
have
no
need
to
be
but
i
afraid
of
its
being
a
succes
de
scandale
mercy
said
clinch
sitting
up
the
butler
and
footman
at
this
moment
appeared
with
the
and
when
they
had
withdrawn
fetherel
bending
her
brightly
rippled
head
above
the
kettle
continued
in
a
murmur
of
avowal
the
title
even
is
a
kind
of
challenge
and
loose
clinch
mused
yes
it
ought
to
take
i
did
choose
it
for
that
reason
the
author
protested
i
should
have
preferred
something
quieter
less
pronounced
but
i
was
determined
not
to
shirk
the
responsibility
of
what
i
had
written
i
want
people
to
know
beforehand
exactly
what
kind
of
book
they
are
buying
well
said
clinch
that
a
degree
of
conscientiousness
that
i
never
met
with
before
so
few
books
fulfil
the
promise
of
their
titles
that
experienced
readers
never
expect
the
fare
to
come
up
to
the
menu
and
loose
will
be
no
disappointment
on
that
score
her
cousin
significantly
returned
i
handled
the
subject
without
gloves
called
a
spade
a
spade
you
simply
make
my
mouth
water
and
to
think
i
have
been
able
to
read
it
yet
because
every
spare
minute
of
my
time
has
been
given
to
correcting
the
proofs
of
the
birds
keep
christmas
there
an
instance
of
the
hardships
of
an
author
life
fetherel
eye
clouded
do
joke
bella
please
i
suppose
to
experienced
authors
there
always
something
absurd
in
the
nervousness
of
a
new
writer
but
in
my
case
so
much
is
at
stake
i
put
so
much
of
myself
into
this
book
and
i
so
afraid
of
being
misunderstood
of
being
as
it
were
in
advance
of
my
time
like
poor
flaubert
you
think
me
ridiculous
and
if
only
my
own
reputation
were
at
stake
i
should
never
give
it
a
thought
but
the
idea
of
dragging
john
name
through
the
mire
clinch
who
had
risen
and
gathered
her
cloak
about
her
stood
surveying
from
her
genial
height
her
cousin
agitated
countenance
why
did
you
use
john
name
then
that
another
of
my
difficulties
i
to
there
would
have
been
no
merit
in
publishing
such
a
book
under
an
assumed
name
it
would
have
been
an
act
of
moral
cowardice
and
loose
is
not
an
ordinary
novel
a
writer
who
dares
to
show
up
the
hollowness
of
social
conventions
must
have
the
courage
of
her
convictions
and
be
willing
to
accept
the
consequences
of
defying
society
can
you
imagine
ibsen
or
tolstoy
writing
under
a
false
name
fetherel
lifted
a
tragic
eye
to
her
cousin
you
do
know
bella
how
often
i
envied
you
since
i
began
to
write
i
used
to
wonder
sometimes
you
wo
mind
my
saying
so
why
with
all
your
cleverness
you
had
taken
up
some
more
exciting
subject
than
natural
history
but
i
see
now
how
wise
you
were
whatever
happens
you
will
never
be
denounced
by
the
press
is
that
what
you
afraid
of
asked
clinch
as
she
grasped
the
bulging
umbrella
which
rested
against
her
chair
my
dear
if
i
had
ever
had
the
good
luck
to
be
denounced
by
the
press
my
brougham
would
be
waiting
at
the
door
for
me
at
this
very
moment
and
i
should
have
to
ruin
this
umbrella
by
using
it
in
the
rain
why
you
innocent
if
i
ever
felt
the
slightest
aptitude
for
showing
up
social
conventions
do
you
suppose
i
should
waste
my
time
writing
ajar
and
to
smell
the
flowers
there
a
fairly
steady
demand
for
and
colloquial
ornithology
but
it
nothing
simply
nothing
to
the
ravenous
call
for
attacks
on
social
institutions
especially
by
those
inside
the
institutions
there
was
often
to
her
cousin
a
lack
of
taste
in
pleasantries
and
on
this
occasion
they
seemed
more
than
usually
irrelevant
and
loose
was
not
written
with
the
idea
of
a
large
sale
clinch
was
unperturbed
perhaps
that
just
as
well
she
returned
with
a
philosophic
shrug
the
surprise
will
be
all
the
pleasanter
i
mean
for
of
course
it
going
to
sell
tremendously
especially
if
you
can
get
the
press
to
denounce
it
bella
how
you
i
sometimes
think
you
say
such
things
expressly
to
tease
me
and
yet
i
should
think
you
of
all
women
would
understand
my
purpose
in
writing
such
a
book
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
that
the
message
i
had
to
deliver
was
not
for
myself
alone
but
for
all
the
other
women
in
the
world
who
have
felt
the
hollowness
of
our
social
shams
the
ignominy
of
bowing
down
to
the
idols
of
the
market
but
have
lacked
either
the
courage
or
the
power
to
proclaim
their
independence
and
i
have
fancied
bella
dear
that
however
severely
society
might
punish
me
for
revealing
its
weaknesses
i
could
count
on
the
sympathy
of
those
who
like
you
fetherel
voice
sank
have
passed
through
the
deep
waters
clinch
gave
herself
a
kind
of
canine
shake
as
though
to
free
her
ample
shoulders
from
any
drop
of
the
element
she
was
supposed
to
have
traversed
oh
call
them
muddy
rather
than
deep
she
returned
and
you
find
my
dear
that
women
who
had
any
wading
to
do
are
rather
shy
of
stirring
up
mud
it
sticks
especially
on
white
clothes
fetherel
lifted
an
undaunted
brow
i
not
afraid
she
proclaimed
and
at
the
same
instant
she
dropped
her
with
a
clatter
and
shrank
back
into
her
seat
there
the
bell
she
exclaimed
and
i
know
it
the
bishop
it
was
in
fact
the
bishop
of
ossining
who
impressively
announced
by
fetherel
butler
now
made
an
entry
that
may
best
be
described
as
not
inadequate
to
the
expectations
the
announcement
raised
the
bishop
always
entered
a
room
well
but
when
unannounced
or
preceded
by
a
low
church
butler
who
gave
him
his
surname
his
appearance
lacked
the
impressiveness
conferred
on
it
by
the
due
specification
of
his
diocesan
dignity
the
bishop
was
very
fond
of
his
niece
fetherel
and
one
of
the
traits
he
most
valued
in
her
was
the
possession
of
a
butler
who
knew
how
to
announce
a
bishop
clinch
was
also
his
niece
but
aside
from
the
fact
that
she
possessed
no
butler
at
all
she
had
laid
herself
open
to
her
criticism
by
writing
insignificant
little
books
which
had
a
way
of
going
into
five
or
ten
editions
while
the
fruits
of
his
own
episcopal
leisure
the
wail
of
jonah
twenty
cantos
in
blank
verse
and
through
a
glass
brightly
or
how
to
raise
funds
fora
memorial
window
inexplicably
languished
on
the
back
shelves
of
a
publisher
noted
for
his
dexterity
in
pushing
devotional
goods
even
this
indiscretion
the
bishop
might
however
have
condoned
had
his
niece
thought
fit
to
turn
to
him
for
support
and
advice
at
the
painful
juncture
of
her
history
when
in
her
own
words
it
became
necessary
for
her
to
invite
clinch
to
look
out
for
another
situation
clinch
misconduct
was
of
the
kind
especially
designed
by
providence
to
test
the
fortitude
of
a
christian
wife
and
mother
and
the
bishop
was
absolutely
distended
with
seasonable
advice
and
edification
so
that
when
bella
met
his
tentative
exhortations
with
the
curt
remark
that
she
preferred
to
do
her
own
housecleaning
unassisted
her
grief
at
her
ingratitude
was
not
untempered
with
sympathy
for
clinch
it
is
not
surprising
therefore
that
the
bishop
warmest
greetings
were
always
reserved
for
fetherel
and
on
this
occasion
clinch
thought
she
detected
in
the
salutation
which
fell
to
her
share
a
pronounced
suggestion
that
her
own
presence
was
superfluous
a
hint
which
she
took
with
her
usual
imperturbable
good
humor
ii
left
alone
with
the
bishop
fetherel
sought
the
nearest
refuge
from
conversation
by
offering
him
a
cup
of
tea
the
bishop
accepted
with
the
preoccupied
air
of
a
man
to
whom
for
the
moment
tea
is
but
a
subordinate
incident
fetherel
nervousness
increased
and
knowing
that
the
surest
way
of
distracting
attention
from
one
own
affairs
is
to
affect
an
interest
in
those
of
one
companion
she
hastily
asked
if
her
uncle
had
come
to
town
on
business
on
business
yes
said
the
bishop
in
an
impressive
tone
i
had
to
see
my
publisher
who
has
been
behaving
rather
unsatisfactorily
in
regard
to
my
last
book
ah
your
last
book
faltered
fetherel
with
a
sickening
sense
of
her
inability
to
recall
the
name
or
nature
of
the
work
in
question
and
a
mental
vow
never
again
to
be
caught
in
such
ignorance
of
a
colleague
productions
a
glass
brightly
the
bishop
explained
with
an
emphasis
which
revealed
his
detection
of
her
predicament
you
may
remember
that
i
sent
you
a
copy
last
christmas
of
course
i
do
fetherel
brightened
it
was
that
delightful
story
of
the
poor
consumptive
girl
who
had
no
money
and
two
little
brothers
to
support
sisters
idiot
sisters
the
bishop
gloomily
corrected
i
mean
sisters
and
who
managed
to
collect
money
enough
to
put
up
a
beautiful
memorial
window
to
her
her
grandfather
whom
she
had
never
seen
but
whose
sermons
had
been
her
chief
consolation
and
support
during
her
long
struggle
with
poverty
and
disease
the
bishop
gave
the
satisfied
sigh
of
the
workman
who
reviews
his
completed
task
a
touching
subject
surely
and
i
believe
i
did
it
justice
at
least
so
my
friends
assured
me
why
yes
i
remember
there
was
a
splendid
review
of
it
in
the
cried
fetherel
moved
by
the
incipient
instinct
of
reciprocity
yes
by
my
dear
friend
gollinger
whose
husband
the
late
dean
gollinger
was
under
very
particular
obligations
to
me
gollinger
is
a
woman
of
rare
literary
acumen
and
her
praise
of
my
book
was
unqualified
but
the
public
wants
more
highly
seasoned
fare
and
the
approval
of
a
thoughtful
churchwoman
carries
less
weight
than
the
sensational
comments
of
an
illiterate
journalist
the
bishop
lent
a
meditative
eye
on
his
spotless
gaiters
at
the
risk
of
horrifying
you
my
dear
he
added
with
a
slight
laugh
i
will
confide
to
you
that
my
best
chance
of
a
popular
success
would
be
to
have
my
book
denounced
by
the
press
denounced
gasped
fetherel
on
what
ground
on
the
ground
of
immorality
the
bishop
evaded
her
startled
gaze
such
a
thing
is
inconceivable
to
you
of
course
but
i
am
only
repeating
what
my
publisher
tells
me
if
for
instance
a
critic
could
be
induced
i
mean
if
a
critic
were
to
be
found
who
called
in
question
the
morality
of
my
heroine
in
sacrificing
her
own
health
and
that
of
her
idiot
sisters
in
order
to
put
up
a
memorial
window
to
her
grandfather
it
would
probably
raise
a
general
controversy
in
the
newspapers
and
i
might
count
on
a
sale
of
ten
or
fifteen
thousand
within
the
next
year
if
he
described
her
as
morbid
or
decadent
it
might
even
run
to
twenty
thousand
but
that
is
more
than
i
permit
myself
to
hope
in
fact
i
should
be
satisfied
with
any
general
charge
of
immorality
the
bishop
sighed
again
i
need
hardly
tell
you
that
i
am
actuated
by
no
mere
literary
ambition
those
whose
opinion
i
most
value
have
assured
me
that
the
book
is
not
without
merit
but
though
it
does
not
become
me
to
dispute
their
verdict
i
can
truly
say
that
my
vanity
as
an
author
is
not
at
stake
i
have
however
a
special
reason
for
wishing
to
increase
the
circulation
of
a
glass
brightly
it
was
written
for
a
purpose
a
purpose
i
have
greatly
at
heart
i
know
cried
his
niece
sympathetically
the
chantry
window
is
still
empty
alas
and
i
had
great
hopes
that
under
providence
my
little
book
might
be
the
means
of
filling
it
all
our
wealthy
parishioners
have
given
lavishly
to
the
cathedral
and
it
was
for
this
reason
that
in
writing
a
glass
i
addressed
my
appeal
more
especially
to
the
less
hoping
by
the
example
of
my
heroine
to
stimulate
the
collection
of
small
sums
throughout
the
entire
diocese
and
perhaps
beyond
it
i
am
sure
the
bishop
feelingly
concluded
the
book
would
have
a
influence
if
people
could
only
be
induced
to
read
it
his
conclusion
touched
a
fresh
thread
of
association
in
vibrating
i
never
thought
of
that
she
cried
the
bishop
looked
at
her
inquiringly
that
one
books
may
not
be
read
at
all
how
dreadful
she
exclaimed
he
smiled
faintly
i
had
not
forgotten
that
i
was
addressing
an
authoress
he
said
indeed
i
should
not
have
dared
to
inflict
my
troubles
on
any
one
not
of
the
craft
fetherel
was
quivering
with
the
consciousness
of
her
involuntary
oh
uncle
she
murmured
in
fact
the
bishop
continued
with
a
gesture
which
seemed
to
brush
away
her
scruples
i
came
here
partly
to
speak
to
you
about
your
novel
and
loose
i
think
you
call
it
fetherel
blushed
assentingly
and
is
it
out
yet
the
bishop
continued
it
came
out
about
a
week
ago
but
you
have
touched
your
tea
and
it
must
be
quite
cold
let
me
give
you
another
cup
my
reason
for
asking
the
bishop
went
on
with
the
bland
inexorableness
with
which
in
his
younger
days
he
had
been
known
to
continue
a
sermon
after
the
senior
warden
had
looked
four
times
at
his
watch
my
reason
for
asking
is
that
i
hoped
i
might
not
be
too
late
to
induce
you
to
change
the
title
fetherel
set
down
the
cup
she
had
filled
the
title
she
faltered
the
bishop
raised
a
reassuring
hand
do
misunderstand
me
dear
child
do
for
a
moment
imagine
that
i
take
it
to
be
in
anyway
indicative
of
the
contents
of
the
book
i
know
you
too
well
for
that
my
first
idea
was
that
it
had
probably
been
forced
on
you
by
an
unscrupulous
publisher
i
know
too
well
to
what
ignoble
compromises
one
may
be
driven
in
such
cases
he
paused
as
though
to
give
her
the
opportunity
of
confirming
this
conjecture
but
she
preserved
an
apprehensive
silence
and
he
went
on
as
though
taking
up
the
second
point
in
his
sermon
or
again
the
name
may
have
taken
your
fancy
without
your
realizing
all
that
it
implies
to
minds
more
alive
than
yours
to
offensive
innuendoes
it
is
ahem
excessively
suggestive
and
i
hope
i
am
not
too
late
to
warn
you
of
the
false
impression
it
is
likely
to
produce
on
the
very
readers
whose
approbation
you
would
most
value
my
friend
gollinger
for
instance
fetherel
as
the
publication
of
her
novel
testified
was
in
theory
a
woman
of
independent
views
and
if
in
practise
she
sometimes
failed
to
live
up
to
her
standard
it
was
rather
from
an
irresistible
tendency
to
adapt
herself
to
her
environment
than
from
any
conscious
lack
of
moral
courage
the
bishop
exordium
had
excited
in
her
that
sense
of
opposition
which
such
admonitions
are
apt
to
provoke
but
as
he
went
on
she
felt
herself
gradually
enclosed
in
an
atmosphere
in
which
her
theories
vainly
gasped
for
breath
the
bishop
had
the
immense
dialectical
advantage
of
invalidating
any
conclusions
at
variance
with
his
own
by
always
assuming
that
his
premises
were
among
the
necessary
laws
of
thought
this
method
combined
with
the
habit
of
ignoring
any
classifications
but
his
own
created
an
element
in
which
the
first
condition
of
existence
was
the
immediate
adoption
of
his
standpoint
so
that
his
niece
as
she
listened
seemed
to
feel
mechlin
cap
spreading
its
conventual
shadow
over
her
rebellious
brow
and
the
revue
de
paris
at
her
elbow
turning
into
a
copy
of
the
reredos
she
had
meant
to
assure
her
uncle
that
she
was
quite
aware
of
the
significance
of
the
title
she
had
chosen
that
it
had
been
deliberately
selected
as
indicating
the
subject
of
her
novel
and
that
the
book
itself
had
been
written
indirect
defiance
of
the
class
of
readers
for
whose
susceptibilities
she
was
alarmed
the
words
were
almost
on
her
lips
when
the
irresistible
suggestion
conveyed
by
the
bishop
tone
and
language
deflected
them
into
the
apologetic
murmur
oh
uncle
you
must
think
i
never
meant
how
much
farther
this
current
of
reaction
might
have
carried
her
the
historian
is
unable
to
computer
for
at
this
point
the
door
opened
and
her
husband
entered
the
room
the
first
review
of
your
book
he
cried
flourishing
a
yellow
envelope
my
dear
bishop
how
lucky
you
here
though
the
trials
of
married
life
have
been
classified
and
catalogued
with
exhaustive
accuracy
there
is
one
form
of
conjugal
misery
which
has
perhaps
received
inadequate
attention
and
that
is
the
suffering
of
the
versatile
woman
whose
husband
is
not
equally
adapted
to
all
her
moods
every
woman
feels
for
the
sister
who
is
compelled
to
wear
a
bonnet
which
does
not
go
with
her
gown
but
how
much
sympathy
is
given
to
her
whose
husband
refuses
to
harmonize
with
the
pose
of
the
moment
scant
justice
has
for
instance
been
done
to
the
misunderstood
wife
whose
husband
persists
in
understanding
her
to
the
submissive
helpmate
whose
taskmaster
shuns
every
opportunity
of
browbeating
her
and
to
the
generous
and
impulsive
being
whose
bills
are
paid
with
philosophic
calm
fetherel
as
wives
go
had
been
fairly
exempt
from
trials
of
this
nature
for
her
husband
if
undistinguished
by
pronounced
brutality
or
indifference
had
at
least
the
negative
merit
of
being
her
intellectual
inferior
landscape
gardeners
who
are
aware
of
the
usefulness
of
a
valley
in
emphasizing
the
height
of
a
hill
can
form
an
idea
of
the
account
to
which
an
accomplished
woman
may
turn
such
deficiencies
and
it
need
scarcely
be
said
that
fetherel
had
made
the
most
of
her
opportunities
it
was
agreeably
obvious
to
every
one
fetherel
included
that
he
was
not
the
man
to
appreciate
such
a
woman
but
there
are
no
limits
to
man
perversity
and
he
did
his
best
to
invalidate
this
advantage
by
admiring
her
without
pretending
to
understand
her
what
she
most
suffered
from
was
this
fatuous
approval
the
maddening
sense
that
however
she
conducted
herself
he
would
always
admire
her
had
he
belonged
to
the
class
whose
conversational
supplies
are
drawn
from
the
domestic
circle
his
wife
name
would
never
have
been
off
his
lips
and
to
fetherel
sensitive
perceptions
his
frequent
silences
were
indicative
of
the
fact
that
she
was
his
one
topic
it
was
in
part
the
attempt
to
escape
this
persistent
approbation
that
had
driven
fetherel
to
authorship
she
had
fancied
that
even
the
most
infatuated
husband
might
be
counted
onto
resent
at
least
negatively
an
attack
on
the
sanctity
of
the
hearth
and
her
anticipations
were
heightened
by
a
sense
of
the
unpardonableness
of
her
act
fetherel
relations
with
her
husband
were
in
fact
complicated
by
an
irrepressible
tendency
to
be
fond
of
him
and
there
was
a
certain
pleasure
in
the
prospect
of
a
situation
that
justified
the
most
explicit
expiation
these
hopes
fetherel
attitude
had
already
defeated
he
read
the
book
with
enthusiasm
he
pressed
it
on
his
friends
he
sent
a
copy
to
his
mother
and
his
very
soul
now
hung
on
the
verdict
of
the
reviewers
it
was
perhaps
this
proof
of
his
general
ineptitude
that
made
his
wife
doubly
alive
to
his
special
defects
so
that
his
inopportune
entrance
was
aggravated
by
the
very
sound
of
his
voice
and
the
hopeless
aberration
of
his
smile
nothing
to
the
observant
is
more
indicative
of
a
man
character
and
circumstances
than
his
way
of
entering
a
room
the
bishop
of
ossining
for
instance
brought
with
him
not
only
an
atmosphere
of
episcopal
authority
but
an
implied
opinion
on
the
verbal
inspiration
of
the
scriptures
and
on
the
attitude
of
the
church
toward
divorce
while
the
appearance
of
fetherel
husband
produced
an
immediate
impression
of
domestic
felicity
his
mere
aspect
implied
that
there
was
a
nursery
upstairs
that
this
wife
if
she
did
not
sew
on
his
buttons
at
least
superintended
the
performance
of
that
task
that
they
both
went
to
church
regularly
and
that
they
dined
with
his
mother
every
sunday
evening
punctually
at
seven
all
this
and
more
was
expressed
in
the
affectionate
gesture
with
which
he
now
raised
the
yellow
envelope
above
fetherel
clutch
and
knowing
the
uselessness
of
begging
him
not
to
be
silly
she
said
with
a
dry
despair
you
boring
the
bishop
horribly
fetherel
turned
a
radiant
eye
on
that
dignitary
she
bores
us
all
horribly
does
she
sir
he
exulted
have
you
read
it
said
his
wife
uncontrollably
read
it
of
course
not
it
just
this
minute
come
i
say
bishop
you
not
going
not
till
i
heard
this
said
the
bishop
settling
himself
in
his
chair
with
an
indulgent
smile
his
niece
glanced
at
him
despairingly
do
let
john
nonsense
detain
you
she
entreated
detain
him
that
good
guffawed
fetherel
it
is
as
long
as
one
of
his
sermons
wo
take
me
five
minutes
to
read
here
listen
to
this
ladies
and
gentlemen
this
age
of
festering
pessimism
and
decadent
depravity
it
is
no
surprise
to
the
nauseated
reviewer
to
open
one
more
volume
saturated
with
the
fetid
emanations
of
the
sewer
fetherel
who
was
not
in
the
habit
of
reading
aloud
paused
with
a
gasp
and
the
bishop
glanced
sharply
at
his
niece
who
kept
her
gaze
fixed
on
the
she
had
not
yet
succeeded
in
transferring
to
his
the
sewer
her
husband
resumed
his
wonder
is
proportionately
great
when
he
lights
on
a
novel
as
sweetly
inoffensive
as
paula
fetherel
fast
and
loose
fetherel
is
we
believe
a
new
hand
at
fiction
and
her
work
reveals
frequent
traces
of
inexperience
but
these
are
more
than
atoned
for
by
her
pure
fresh
view
of
life
and
her
altogether
unfashionable
regard
for
the
moral
susceptibilities
let
no
one
be
induced
by
its
distinctly
misleading
title
to
forego
the
enjoyment
of
this
pleasant
picture
of
domestic
life
which
in
spite
of
a
total
lack
of
force
in
and
of
consecutiveness
in
incident
may
be
described
as
a
distinctly
pretty
story
iii
it
was
several
weeks
later
that
clinch
once
more
brought
the
plebeian
aroma
of
heated
and
muddy
into
the
atmosphere
of
her
cousin
well
she
said
tossing
a
damp
bundle
of
proof
into
the
corner
of
a
bergere
i
read
it
at
last
and
i
not
so
awfully
shocked
fetherel
who
sat
near
the
fire
with
her
head
propped
on
a
languid
hand
looked
up
without
speaking
mercy
paula
said
her
visitor
you
fetherel
shook
her
head
i
was
never
better
she
said
mournfully
then
may
i
help
myself
to
tea
thanks
clinch
carefully
removed
her
mended
glove
before
taking
a
buttered
then
she
glanced
again
at
her
cousin
it
not
what
i
said
just
now
she
ventured
just
now
about
and
loose
i
came
to
talk
it
over
fetherel
sprang
to
her
feet
i
never
she
cried
dramatically
want
to
hear
it
mentioned
again
paula
exclaimed
clinch
setting
down
her
cup
fetherel
slowly
turned
on
her
an
eye
brimming
with
the
incommunicable
then
dropping
into
her
seat
again
she
added
with
a
tragic
laugh
there
nothing
left
to
say
nothing
faltered
clinch
longing
for
another
but
feeling
the
inappropriateness
of
the
impulse
in
an
atmosphere
so
charged
with
the
portentous
do
you
mean
that
everything
been
said
she
looked
tentatively
at
her
cousin
have
they
been
nice
they
been
odious
odious
fetherel
burst
out
with
an
ineffectual
clutch
at
her
handkerchief
it
been
perfectly
intolerable
clinch
philosophically
resigning
herself
to
the
propriety
of
taking
no
more
tea
crossed
over
to
her
cousin
and
laid
a
sympathizing
hand
on
that
lady
agitated
shoulder
it
a
bore
at
first
she
conceded
but
you
be
surprised
to
see
how
soon
one
gets
used
to
it
i
shall
never
get
used
to
it
fetherel
brokenly
declared
have
they
been
so
very
nasty
all
of
them
every
one
of
them
the
novelist
sobbed
i
so
sorry
dear
it
hurt
i
know
but
had
you
rather
expected
it
expected
it
cried
fetherel
sitting
up
clinch
felt
her
way
warily
i
only
mean
dear
that
i
fancied
from
what
you
said
before
the
book
came
out
that
you
rather
expected
that
you
rather
discounted
their
recommending
it
to
everybody
as
a
perfectly
harmless
story
good
gracious
is
what
they
done
fetherel
speechlessly
nodded
every
one
of
them
every
one
whew
said
clinch
with
an
incipient
whistle
why
you
just
said
it
yourself
her
cousin
suddenly
reproached
her
said
what
that
you
were
so
shocked
i
oh
well
you
see
you
keyed
me
up
to
such
a
pitch
that
it
quite
as
bad
as
i
expected
fetherel
lifted
a
smile
steeled
for
the
worst
why
not
say
at
once
she
suggested
that
it
a
distinctly
pretty
story
they
have
said
they
all
said
it
my
poor
paula
even
the
bishop
the
bishop
called
it
a
pretty
story
he
wrote
me
i
his
letter
somewhere
the
title
rather
scared
him
he
wanted
me
to
change
it
but
when
he
read
the
book
he
wrote
that
it
was
all
right
and
that
he
sent
several
copies
to
his
friends
the
old
hypocrite
cried
clinch
that
was
nothing
but
professional
jealousy
do
you
think
so
cried
her
cousin
brightening
sure
of
it
my
dear
his
own
books
do
sell
and
he
knew
the
quickest
way
to
kill
yours
was
to
distribute
it
through
the
diocese
with
his
blessing
then
you
do
really
think
it
a
pretty
story
dear
me
no
not
nearly
as
bad
as
that
you
so
good
bella
but
the
reviewers
oh
the
reviewers
clinch
jeered
she
gazed
meditatively
at
the
cold
remains
of
her
let
me
see
she
said
suddenly
do
you
happen
to
remember
if
the
first
review
came
out
in
an
important
paper
yes
the
that
it
i
thought
so
then
the
others
simply
followed
suit
they
often
do
if
a
big
paper
sets
the
pace
saves
a
lot
of
trouble
now
if
you
could
only
have
got
the
to
denounce
you
that
what
the
bishop
said
cried
fetherel
he
did
he
said
his
only
chance
of
selling
a
glass
brightly
was
to
have
it
denounced
on
the
ground
of
immorality
h
said
clinch
i
thought
he
knew
a
trick
or
two
she
turned
an
illuminated
eye
on
her
cousin
you
ought
to
get
to
denounce
and
loose
she
cried
fetherel
looked
at
her
suspiciously
i
suppose
every
book
must
stand
or
fall
on
its
own
merits
she
said
in
an
unconvinced
tone
bosh
that
view
is
as
extinct
as
the
and
the
it
belongs
to
the
time
when
people
read
books
nobody
does
that
now
the
reviewer
was
the
first
to
set
the
example
and
the
public
were
only
too
thankful
to
follow
it
at
first
they
read
the
reviews
now
they
read
only
the
publishers
extracts
from
them
even
these
are
rapidly
being
replaced
by
paragraphs
borrowed
from
the
vocabulary
of
commerce
i
often
have
to
look
twice
before
i
am
sure
if
i
am
reading
a
advertisement
or
the
announcement
of
a
new
batch
of
literature
the
publishers
will
soon
be
having
their
and
spring
openings
and
their
importations
for
week
but
the
bishop
is
right
of
course
nothing
helps
a
book
like
a
rousing
attack
on
its
morals
and
as
the
publishers
ca
exactly
proclaim
the
impropriety
of
their
own
wares
the
task
has
to
be
left
to
the
press
or
the
pulpit
the
pulpit
fetherel
mused
why
yes
look
at
those
two
novels
in
england
last
year
fetherel
shook
her
head
hopelessly
there
is
so
much
more
interest
in
literature
in
england
than
here
well
we
got
to
make
the
supply
create
the
demand
the
bishop
could
run
your
novel
up
into
the
hundred
thousands
in
no
time
but
if
he
ca
make
his
own
sell
my
dear
a
man
ca
very
well
preach
against
his
own
writings
clinch
rose
and
picked
up
her
proofs
i
awfully
sorry
for
you
paula
dear
she
concluded
but
i
help
being
thankful
that
there
no
demand
for
pessimism
in
the
field
of
natural
history
fancy
having
to
write
fall
of
a
sparrow
or
the
plants
misbehave
iv
fetherel
driving
up
to
the
grand
central
station
one
morning
about
five
months
later
caught
sight
of
the
distinguished
novelist
archer
hynes
hurrying
into
the
ahead
of
her
hynes
on
his
side
recognizing
her
brougham
turned
back
to
greet
her
as
the
footman
opened
the
my
dear
colleague
is
it
possible
that
we
are
traveling
together
fetherel
blushed
with
pleasure
hynes
had
given
her
two
columns
of
praise
in
the
sunday
meteor
and
she
had
not
yet
learned
to
disguise
her
gratitude
i
am
going
to
ossining
she
said
smilingly
so
am
i
why
this
is
almost
as
good
as
an
elopement
and
it
will
end
where
elopements
ought
to
in
church
in
church
you
not
going
to
ossining
to
go
to
church
why
not
there
a
special
ceremony
in
the
cathedral
the
chantry
window
is
to
be
unveiled
the
chantry
window
how
picturesque
what
a
chantry
and
why
do
you
want
to
see
it
unveiled
are
you
after
copy
doing
something
in
the
huysmans
manner
cathedrale
eh
oh
no
fetherel
hesitated
i
going
simply
to
please
my
uncle
she
said
at
last
your
uncle
the
bishop
you
know
she
smiled
the
bishop
the
bishop
of
ossining
why
was
he
the
chap
who
made
that
ridiculous
attack
on
your
book
is
that
prehistoric
ass
your
uncle
upon
my
soul
i
think
you
mighty
forgiving
to
travel
all
the
way
to
ossining
for
one
of
his
sociables
fetherel
smile
flowed
into
a
gentle
laugh
oh
i
never
allowed
that
to
interfere
with
our
friendship
my
uncle
felt
dreadfully
about
having
to
speak
publicly
against
my
book
it
was
a
great
deal
harder
for
him
than
for
me
but
he
thought
it
his
duty
to
do
so
he
has
the
very
highest
sense
of
duty
well
said
hynes
with
a
shrug
i
do
know
that
he
did
do
you
a
good
turn
look
at
that
they
were
standing
near
the
and
he
pointed
to
a
placard
surmounting
the
counter
and
emblazoned
with
the
conspicuous
announcement
fast
and
loose
new
edition
with
author
portrait
hundred
and
fiftieth
thousand
fetherel
frowned
impatiently
how
absurd
they
no
right
to
use
my
picture
as
a
poster
there
our
train
said
hynes
and
they
began
to
push
their
way
through
the
crowd
surging
toward
one
of
the
inner
doors
as
they
stood
wedged
between
circumferent
shoulders
fetherel
became
conscious
of
the
fixed
stare
of
a
pretty
girl
who
whispered
eagerly
to
her
companion
look
myrtle
that
paula
fetherel
right
behind
us
i
knew
her
in
a
minute
gracious
where
cried
the
other
girl
giving
her
head
a
twist
which
swept
her
gainsborough
plumes
across
fetherel
face
the
first
speaker
words
had
carried
beyond
her
companion
ear
and
a
woman
in
spectacles
who
clutched
a
copy
of
the
journal
of
psychology
on
one
hand
stretched
her
disengaged
hand
across
the
intervening
barrier
of
humanity
have
i
the
privilege
of
addressing
the
distinguished
author
of
and
loose
if
so
let
me
thank
you
in
the
name
of
the
psychological
league
of
peoria
for
your
magnificent
courage
in
raising
the
standard
of
revolt
against
you
can
tell
us
the
rest
in
the
car
said
a
fat
man
pressing
his
bulk
against
the
speaker
arm
fetherel
blushing
embarrassed
and
happy
slipped
into
the
space
produced
by
this
displacement
and
a
few
moments
later
had
taken
her
seat
in
the
train
she
was
a
little
late
and
the
other
chairs
were
already
filled
by
a
company
of
elderly
ladies
and
clergymen
who
seemed
to
belong
to
the
same
party
and
were
still
busy
exchanging
greetings
and
settling
themselves
in
their
places
one
of
the
ladies
at
fetherel
approach
uttered
an
exclamation
of
pleasure
and
advanced
with
outstretched
hand
my
dear
fetherel
i
am
so
delighted
to
see
you
here
may
i
hope
you
are
going
to
the
unveiling
of
the
chantry
window
the
dear
bishop
so
hoped
that
you
would
do
so
but
perhaps
i
ought
to
introduce
myself
i
am
gollinger
she
lowered
her
voice
expressively
one
of
your
oldest
friends
one
who
has
stood
close
to
him
through
all
this
sad
business
and
who
knows
what
he
suffered
when
he
felt
obliged
to
sacrifice
family
affection
to
the
call
of
duty
fetherel
who
had
smiled
and
colored
slightly
at
the
beginning
of
this
speech
received
its
close
with
a
deprecating
gesture
oh
pray
do
mention
it
she
murmured
i
quite
understood
how
my
uncle
was
placed
i
bore
him
no
ill
will
for
feeling
obliged
to
preach
against
my
book
he
understood
that
and
was
so
touched
by
it
he
has
often
told
me
that
it
was
the
hardest
task
he
was
ever
called
upon
to
perform
and
do
you
know
he
quite
feels
that
this
unexpected
gift
of
the
chantry
window
is
in
some
way
a
return
for
his
courage
in
preaching
that
sermon
fetherel
smiled
faintly
does
he
feel
that
yes
he
really
does
when
the
funds
for
the
window
were
so
mysteriously
placed
at
his
disposal
just
as
he
had
begun
to
despair
of
raising
them
he
assured
me
that
he
could
not
help
connecting
the
fact
with
his
denunciation
of
your
book
dear
uncle
sighed
fetherel
did
he
say
that
and
now
continued
gollinger
with
cumulative
rapture
now
that
you
are
about
to
show
by
appearing
at
the
ceremony
that
there
has
been
no
break
in
your
friendly
relations
the
dear
happiness
will
be
complete
he
was
so
longing
to
have
you
come
to
the
unveiling
he
might
have
counted
on
me
said
fetherel
still
smiling
ah
that
is
so
beautifully
forgiving
of
you
cried
gollinger
enthusiastically
but
then
the
bishop
has
always
assured
me
that
your
real
nature
was
very
different
from
that
which
if
you
will
pardon
my
saying
so
seems
to
be
revealed
by
your
brilliant
but
er
rather
subversive
book
you
only
knew
my
niece
dear
gollinger
he
always
said
would
see
that
her
novel
was
written
in
all
innocence
of
heart
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
when
i
first
read
the
book
i
did
think
it
so
very
shocking
it
was
till
the
dear
bishop
had
explained
tome
but
dear
me
i
must
take
up
your
time
in
this
way
when
so
many
others
are
anxious
to
have
a
word
with
you
fetherel
glanced
at
her
in
surprise
and
gollinger
continued
with
a
playful
smile
you
forget
that
your
face
is
familiar
to
thousands
whom
you
have
never
seen
we
all
recognized
you
the
moment
you
entered
the
train
and
my
friends
here
are
so
eager
to
make
your
acquaintance
even
those
her
smile
deepened
who
thought
the
dear
bishop
not
in
his
attack
on
your
remarkable
novel
v
a
religious
light
filled
the
chantry
of
ossining
cathedral
filtering
through
the
linen
curtain
which
veiled
the
central
window
and
mingling
with
the
blaze
of
tapers
on
the
richly
adorned
altar
in
this
devout
atmosphere
agreeably
laden
with
the
aroma
of
easter
lilies
and
forced
lilacs
fetherel
knelt
with
a
sense
of
luxurious
satisfaction
beside
her
sat
archer
hynes
who
had
remembered
that
there
was
to
be
a
church
scene
in
his
next
novel
and
that
his
impressions
of
the
devotional
environment
needed
refreshing
fetherel
was
very
happy
she
was
conscious
that
her
entrance
had
sent
a
thrill
through
the
female
devotees
who
packed
the
chantry
and
she
had
humor
enough
to
enjoy
the
thought
that
but
for
the
good
denunciation
of
her
book
the
heads
of
his
flock
would
not
have
been
turned
so
eagerly
in
her
direction
moreover
as
she
had
entered
she
had
caught
sight
of
a
society
reporter
and
she
knew
that
her
presence
and
the
fact
that
she
was
accompanied
by
hynes
would
be
conspicuously
proclaimed
in
the
morning
papers
all
these
evidences
of
the
success
of
her
handiwork
might
have
turned
a
calmer
head
than
fetherel
and
though
she
had
now
learned
to
dissemble
her
gratification
it
still
filled
her
inwardly
with
a
delightful
glow
the
bishop
was
somewhat
late
in
appearing
and
she
employed
the
interval
in
meditating
on
the
plot
of
her
next
novel
which
was
already
partly
sketched
out
but
for
which
she
had
been
unable
to
find
a
satisfactory
denouement
by
a
not
uncommon
process
of
ratiocination
fetherel
success
had
convinced
her
of
her
vocation
she
was
sure
now
that
it
was
her
duty
to
lay
bare
the
secret
of
society
and
she
was
resolved
that
there
should
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
purpose
of
her
new
book
experience
had
shown
her
that
where
she
had
fancied
she
was
calling
a
spade
a
spade
she
had
in
fact
been
alluding
in
guarded
terms
to
the
shovel
she
was
determined
not
to
repeat
the
same
mistake
and
she
flattered
herself
that
her
coming
novel
would
not
need
an
episcopal
denunciation
to
insure
its
sale
however
likely
it
was
to
receive
this
crowning
evidence
of
success
she
had
reached
this
point
in
her
meditations
when
the
choir
burst
into
song
and
the
ceremony
of
the
unveiling
began
the
bishop
almost
always
felicitous
in
his
addresses
to
the
fair
sex
was
never
more
so
than
when
he
was
celebrating
the
triumph
of
one
of
his
cherished
purposes
there
was
a
peculiar
mixture
of
christian
humility
and
episcopal
exultation
in
the
manner
with
which
he
called
attention
to
the
creator
promptness
in
responding
to
his
demand
for
funds
and
he
had
never
been
more
happily
inspired
than
in
eulogizing
the
mysterious
gift
of
the
chantry
window
though
no
hint
of
the
donor
identity
had
been
allowed
to
escape
him
it
was
generally
understood
that
the
bishop
knew
who
had
given
the
window
and
the
congregation
awaited
in
a
flutter
of
suspense
the
possible
announcement
of
a
name
none
came
however
though
the
bishop
deliciously
titillated
the
curiosity
of
his
flock
by
circling
ever
closer
about
the
interesting
secret
he
would
not
disguise
from
them
he
said
that
the
heart
which
had
divined
his
inmost
wish
had
been
a
woman
is
it
not
to
woman
intuitions
that
more
than
half
the
happiness
of
earth
is
owing
what
man
is
obliged
to
learn
by
the
laborious
process
of
experience
woman
wondrous
instinct
tells
her
at
a
glance
and
so
it
had
been
with
this
cherished
scheme
this
completion
of
their
beautiful
chantry
so
much
at
least
he
was
allowed
to
reveal
and
indeed
had
he
not
done
so
the
window
itself
would
have
spoken
for
him
since
the
first
glance
at
its
touching
subject
and
exquisite
design
would
show
it
to
have
originated
in
a
woman
heart
this
tribute
to
the
sex
was
received
with
an
audible
sigh
of
contentment
and
the
bishop
always
stimulated
by
such
evidence
of
his
sway
over
his
hearers
took
up
his
theme
with
gathering
eloquence
yes
a
woman
heart
had
planned
the
gift
a
woman
hand
had
executed
it
and
might
he
add
without
too
far
withdrawing
the
veil
in
which
christian
beneficence
ever
loved
to
drape
its
acts
might
he
add
that
under
providence
a
book
a
simple
book
a
mere
tale
in
fact
had
had
its
share
in
the
good
work
for
which
they
were
assembled
to
give
thanks
at
this
unexpected
announcement
a
ripple
of
excitement
ran
through
the
assemblage
and
more
than
one
head
was
abruptly
turned
in
the
direction
of
fetherel
who
sat
listening
in
an
agony
of
wonder
and
confusion
it
did
not
escape
the
observant
novelist
at
her
side
that
she
drew
down
her
veil
to
conceal
an
uncontrollable
blush
and
this
evidence
of
dismay
caused
him
to
fix
an
attentive
gaze
on
her
while
from
her
seat
across
the
aisle
gollinger
sent
a
smile
of
unctuous
approval
a
book
a
simple
book
the
bishop
voice
went
on
above
this
flutter
of
mingled
emotions
what
is
a
book
only
a
few
pages
and
a
little
ink
and
yet
one
of
the
mightiest
instruments
which
providence
has
devised
for
shaping
the
destinies
of
man
one
of
the
most
powerful
influences
for
good
or
evil
which
the
creator
has
placed
in
the
hands
of
his
creatures
the
air
seemed
intolerably
close
to
fetherel
and
she
drew
out
her
and
then
thrust
it
hurriedly
away
conscious
that
she
was
still
the
center
of
an
unenviable
attention
and
all
the
while
the
bishop
voice
droned
on
and
of
all
forms
of
literature
fiction
is
doubtless
that
which
has
exercised
the
greatest
sway
for
good
or
ill
over
the
passions
and
imagination
of
the
masses
yes
my
friends
i
am
the
first
to
acknowledge
it
no
sermon
however
eloquent
no
theological
treatise
however
learned
and
convincing
has
ever
inflamed
the
heart
and
imagination
like
a
novel
a
simple
novel
incalculable
is
the
power
exercised
over
humanity
by
the
great
magicians
of
the
pen
a
power
ever
enlarging
its
boundaries
and
increasing
its
responsibilities
as
popular
education
multiplies
the
number
of
readers
it
is
the
hand
which
can
pour
balm
on
countless
human
sufferings
or
inoculate
mankind
with
the
festering
poison
of
a
corrupt
imagination
fetherel
had
turned
white
and
her
eyes
were
fixed
with
a
blind
stare
of
anger
on
the
figure
in
the
center
of
the
chancel
and
too
often
alas
it
is
the
poison
and
not
the
balm
which
the
unscrupulous
hand
of
genius
proffers
to
its
unsuspecting
readers
but
my
friends
why
should
i
continue
none
know
better
than
an
assemblage
of
christian
women
such
as
i
am
now
addressing
the
beneficent
or
baleful
influences
of
modern
fiction
and
so
when
i
say
that
this
beautiful
chantry
window
of
ours
owes
its
existence
in
part
to
the
romancer
pen
the
bishop
paused
and
bending
forward
seemed
to
seek
a
certain
face
among
the
countenances
eagerly
addressed
to
his
when
i
say
that
this
pen
which
for
personal
reasons
it
does
not
become
me
to
celebrate
unduly
fetherel
at
this
point
half
rose
pushing
back
her
chair
which
scraped
loudly
over
the
marble
floor
but
hynes
involuntarily
laid
a
warning
hand
on
her
arm
and
she
sank
down
with
a
confused
murmur
about
the
when
i
confess
that
this
pen
which
for
once
at
least
has
proved
itself
so
much
mightier
than
the
sword
is
that
which
was
inspired
to
trace
the
simple
narrative
of
a
glass
brightly
fetherel
looked
up
with
a
gasp
of
mingled
relief
and
anger
when
i
tell
you
my
dear
friends
that
it
was
your
bishop
own
work
which
first
roused
the
mind
of
one
of
his
flock
to
the
crying
need
of
a
chantry
window
i
think
you
will
admit
that
i
am
justified
in
celebrating
the
triumphs
of
the
pen
even
though
it
be
the
modest
instrument
which
your
own
bishop
wields
the
bishop
paused
impressively
and
a
faint
gasp
of
surprise
and
disappointment
was
audible
throughout
the
chantry
something
very
different
from
this
conclusion
had
been
expected
and
even
gollinger
lips
curled
with
a
slightly
ironic
smile
but
archer
hynes
attention
was
chiefly
reserved
for
fetherel
whose
face
had
changed
with
astonishing
rapidity
from
surprise
to
annoyance
from
annoyance
to
relief
and
then
back
again
to
something
very
like
indignation
the
address
concluded
the
actual
ceremony
of
the
unveiling
was
about
to
take
place
and
the
attention
of
the
congregation
soon
reverted
to
the
chancel
where
the
choir
had
grouped
themselves
beneath
the
veiled
window
prepared
to
burst
into
a
chant
of
praise
as
the
bishop
drew
back
the
hanging
the
moment
was
an
impressive
one
and
every
eye
was
fixed
on
the
curtain
even
hynes
gaze
strayed
to
it
for
a
moment
but
soon
returned
to
his
neighbor
face
and
then
he
perceived
that
fetherel
alone
of
all
the
persons
present
was
not
looking
at
the
window
her
eyes
were
fixed
in
an
indignant
stare
on
the
bishop
a
flush
of
anger
burned
becomingly
under
her
veil
and
her
hands
nervously
crumpled
the
beautifully
printed
program
of
the
ceremony
hynes
broke
into
a
smile
of
comprehension
he
glanced
at
the
bishop
and
back
at
the
bishop
niece
then
as
the
episcopal
hand
was
solemnly
raised
to
draw
back
the
curtain
he
bent
and
whispered
in
fetherel
ear
why
you
gave
it
yourself
you
wonderful
woman
of
course
you
gave
it
yourself
fetherel
raised
her
eyes
to
his
with
a
start
her
blush
deepened
and
her
lips
shaped
a
hasty
no
but
the
denial
was
deflected
into
the
indignant
murmur
it
was
silly
book
that
did
it
anyhow
the
lady
maid
bell
i
it
was
the
autumn
after
i
had
the
typhoid
i
been
three
months
in
hospital
and
when
i
came
out
i
looked
so
weak
and
tottery
that
the
two
or
three
ladies
i
applied
to
were
afraid
to
engage
me
most
of
my
money
was
gone
and
after
i
boarded
for
two
months
hanging
about
the
and
answering
any
advertisement
that
looked
any
way
respectable
i
pretty
nearly
lost
heart
for
fretting
had
made
me
fatter
and
i
did
see
why
my
luck
should
ever
turn
it
did
though
or
i
thought
so
at
the
time
a
railton
a
friend
of
the
lady
that
first
brought
me
out
to
the
states
met
me
one
day
and
stopped
to
speak
to
me
she
was
one
that
had
always
a
friendly
way
with
her
she
asked
me
what
ailed
me
to
look
so
white
and
when
i
told
her
why
hartley
says
she
i
believe
i
got
the
very
place
for
you
come
in
and
we
talk
about
it
the
next
day
when
i
called
she
told
me
the
lady
she
in
mind
was
a
niece
of
hers
a
brympton
a
youngish
lady
but
something
of
an
invalid
who
lived
all
the
year
round
at
her
on
the
hudson
owing
to
not
being
able
to
stand
the
fatigue
of
town
life
now
hartley
railton
said
in
that
cheery
way
that
always
made
me
feel
things
must
be
going
to
take
a
turn
for
the
better
now
understand
me
it
not
a
cheerful
place
i
sending
you
to
the
house
is
big
and
gloomy
my
niece
is
nervous
vaporish
her
husband
well
he
generally
away
and
the
two
children
are
dead
a
year
ago
i
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
shutting
a
rosy
active
girl
like
you
into
a
vault
but
you
not
particularly
brisk
yourself
just
now
are
you
and
a
quiet
place
with
country
air
and
wholesome
food
and
early
hours
ought
to
be
the
very
thing
for
you
do
mistake
me
she
added
for
i
suppose
i
looked
a
trifle
downcast
you
may
find
it
dull
but
you
wo
be
unhappy
my
niece
is
an
angel
her
former
maid
who
died
last
spring
had
been
with
her
twenty
years
and
worshipped
the
ground
she
walked
on
she
a
kind
mistress
to
all
and
where
the
mistress
is
kind
as
you
know
the
servants
are
generally
so
probably
get
on
well
enough
with
the
rest
of
the
household
and
the
very
woman
i
want
for
my
niece
quiet
and
educated
above
your
station
you
read
aloud
well
i
think
that
a
good
thing
my
niece
likes
to
be
read
to
she
wants
a
maid
that
can
be
something
of
a
companion
her
last
was
and
i
ca
say
how
she
misses
her
it
a
lonely
life
well
have
you
decided
why
i
said
i
not
afraid
of
solitude
well
then
go
my
niece
will
take
you
on
my
recommendation
telegraph
her
at
once
and
you
can
take
the
afternoon
train
she
has
no
one
to
wait
on
her
at
present
and
i
do
want
you
to
lose
any
time
i
was
ready
enough
to
start
yet
something
in
me
hung
back
and
to
gain
time
i
asked
and
the
gentleman
the
gentleman
almost
always
away
i
tell
you
said
ralston
and
when
he
there
says
she
suddenly
you
only
to
keep
out
of
his
way
i
took
the
afternoon
train
and
got
out
at
d
station
at
about
four
a
groom
in
a
was
waiting
and
we
drove
off
at
a
smart
pace
it
was
a
dull
october
day
with
rain
hanging
close
overhead
and
by
the
time
we
turned
into
the
brympton
place
woods
the
daylight
was
almost
gone
the
drive
wound
through
the
woods
for
a
mile
or
two
and
came
out
on
a
gravel
court
shut
in
with
thickets
of
tall
shrubs
there
were
no
lights
in
the
windows
and
the
house
look
a
bit
gloomy
i
had
asked
no
questions
of
the
groom
for
i
never
was
one
to
get
my
notion
of
new
masters
from
their
other
servants
i
prefer
to
wait
and
see
for
myself
but
i
could
tell
by
the
look
of
everything
that
i
had
got
into
the
right
kind
of
house
and
that
things
were
done
handsomely
a
cook
met
me
at
the
back
door
and
called
the
to
show
me
up
to
my
room
you
see
madam
later
she
said
brympton
has
a
visitor
i
had
fancied
brympton
was
a
lady
to
have
many
visitors
and
somehow
the
words
cheered
me
i
followed
the
upstairs
and
saw
through
a
door
on
the
upper
landing
that
the
main
part
of
the
house
seemed
with
dark
panelling
and
a
number
of
old
portraits
another
flight
of
stairs
led
us
up
to
the
servants
wing
it
was
almost
dark
now
and
the
excused
herself
for
not
having
brought
a
light
but
there
matches
in
your
room
she
said
and
if
you
go
careful
you
be
all
right
mind
the
step
at
the
end
of
the
passage
your
room
is
just
beyond
i
looked
ahead
as
she
spoke
and
down
the
passage
i
saw
a
woman
standing
she
drew
back
into
a
doorway
as
we
passed
and
the
did
appear
to
notice
her
she
was
a
thin
woman
with
a
white
face
and
a
darkish
stuff
gown
and
apron
i
took
her
for
the
housekeeper
and
thought
it
odd
that
she
did
speak
but
just
gave
me
a
long
look
as
she
went
by
my
room
opened
into
a
square
hall
at
the
end
of
the
passage
facing
my
door
was
another
which
stood
open
the
exclaimed
when
she
saw
it
there
blinder
left
that
door
open
again
said
she
closing
it
is
blinder
the
housekeeper
there
no
housekeeper
blinder
the
cook
and
is
that
her
room
laws
no
said
the
that
nobody
room
it
empty
i
mean
and
the
door
had
ought
to
be
open
brympton
wants
it
kept
locked
she
opened
my
door
and
led
me
into
a
neat
room
nicely
furnished
with
a
picture
or
two
on
the
walls
and
having
lit
a
candle
she
took
leave
telling
me
that
the
tea
was
at
six
and
that
brympton
would
see
me
afterward
i
found
them
a
set
in
the
servants
hall
and
by
what
they
let
fall
i
gathered
that
as
railton
had
said
brympton
was
the
kindest
of
ladies
but
i
did
take
much
notice
of
their
talk
for
i
was
watching
to
see
the
pale
woman
in
the
dark
gown
come
in
she
did
show
herself
however
and
i
wondered
if
she
ate
apart
but
if
she
was
the
housekeeper
why
should
she
suddenly
it
struck
me
that
she
might
be
a
trained
nurse
and
in
that
case
her
meals
would
of
course
be
served
in
her
room
if
brympton
was
an
invalid
it
was
likely
enough
she
had
a
nurse
the
idea
annoyed
me
i
own
for
not
always
the
easiest
to
get
on
with
and
if
i
known
i
have
taken
the
place
but
there
i
was
and
there
was
no
use
pulling
a
long
face
over
it
and
not
being
one
to
ask
questions
i
waited
to
see
what
would
turn
up
when
tea
was
over
the
said
to
the
footman
has
ranford
gone
and
when
he
said
yes
she
told
me
to
come
up
with
her
to
brympton
brympton
was
lying
down
in
her
bedroom
her
lounge
stood
near
the
fire
and
beside
it
was
a
shaded
lamp
she
was
a
lady
but
when
she
smiled
i
felt
there
was
nothing
i
would
do
for
her
she
spoke
very
pleasantly
in
a
low
voice
asking
me
my
name
and
age
and
so
on
and
if
i
had
everything
i
wanted
and
if
i
was
afraid
of
feeling
lonely
in
the
country
not
with
you
i
would
be
madam
i
said
and
the
words
surprised
me
when
i
spoken
them
for
i
not
an
impulsive
person
but
it
was
just
as
if
i
thought
aloud
she
seemed
pleased
at
that
and
said
she
hoped
i
continue
in
the
same
mind
then
she
gave
me
a
few
directions
about
her
toilet
and
said
agnes
the
would
show
me
next
morning
where
things
were
kept
i
am
tired
and
shall
dine
upstairs
she
said
agnes
will
bring
me
my
tray
that
you
may
have
time
to
unpack
and
settle
yourself
and
later
you
may
come
and
undress
me
very
well
i
said
you
ring
i
suppose
i
thought
she
looked
odd
no
agnes
will
fetch
you
says
she
quickly
and
took
up
her
book
again
well
that
was
certainly
strange
a
lady
maid
having
to
be
fetched
by
the
whenever
her
lady
wanted
her
i
wondered
if
there
were
no
bells
in
the
house
but
the
next
day
i
satisfied
myself
that
there
was
one
in
every
room
and
a
special
one
ringing
from
my
room
to
mine
and
after
that
it
did
strike
me
as
queer
that
whenever
brympton
wanted
anything
she
rang
for
agnes
who
had
to
walk
the
whole
length
of
the
servants
wing
to
call
me
but
that
was
the
only
queer
thing
in
the
house
the
very
next
day
i
found
out
that
brympton
had
no
nurse
and
then
i
asked
agnes
about
the
woman
i
had
seen
in
the
passage
the
afternoon
before
agnes
said
she
had
seen
no
one
and
i
saw
that
she
thought
i
was
dreaming
to
be
sure
it
was
dusk
when
we
went
down
the
passage
and
she
had
excused
herself
for
not
bringing
a
light
but
i
had
seen
the
woman
plain
enough
to
know
her
again
if
we
should
meet
i
decided
that
she
must
have
been
a
friend
of
the
cook
or
of
one
of
the
other
perhaps
she
had
come
down
from
town
for
a
night
visit
and
the
servants
wanted
it
kept
secret
some
ladies
are
very
stiff
about
having
their
servants
friends
in
the
house
overnight
at
any
rate
i
made
up
my
mind
to
ask
no
more
questions
in
a
day
or
two
another
odd
thing
happened
i
was
chatting
one
afternoon
with
blinder
who
was
a
friendly
disposed
woman
and
had
been
longer
in
the
house
than
the
other
servants
and
she
asked
me
if
i
was
quite
comfortable
and
had
everything
i
needed
i
said
i
had
no
fault
to
find
with
my
place
or
with
my
mistress
but
i
thought
it
odd
that
in
so
large
a
house
there
was
no
for
the
lady
maid
why
says
she
there
one
the
room
you
in
is
the
old
oh
said
i
and
where
did
the
other
lady
maid
sleep
at
that
she
grew
confused
and
said
hurriedly
that
the
servants
rooms
had
all
been
changed
about
last
year
and
she
did
rightly
remember
that
struck
me
as
peculiar
but
i
went
on
as
if
i
had
noticed
well
there
a
vacant
room
opposite
mine
and
i
mean
to
ask
brympton
if
i
may
use
that
as
a
to
my
astonishment
blinder
went
white
and
gave
my
hand
a
kind
of
squeeze
do
do
that
my
dear
said
she
to
tell
you
the
truth
that
was
emma
saxon
room
and
my
mistress
has
kept
it
closed
ever
since
her
death
and
who
was
emma
saxon
brympton
former
maid
the
one
that
was
with
her
so
many
years
said
i
remembering
what
railton
had
told
me
blinder
nodded
what
sort
of
woman
was
she
no
better
walked
the
earth
said
blinder
my
mistress
loved
her
like
a
sister
but
i
mean
what
did
she
look
like
blinder
got
up
and
gave
me
a
kind
of
angry
stare
i
no
great
hand
at
describing
she
said
and
i
believe
my
pastry
rising
and
she
walked
off
into
the
kitchen
and
shut
the
door
after
her
ii
i
had
been
near
a
week
at
brympton
before
i
saw
my
master
word
came
that
he
was
arriving
one
afternoon
and
a
change
passed
over
the
whole
household
it
was
plain
that
nobody
loved
him
below
stairs
blinder
took
uncommon
care
with
the
dinner
that
night
but
she
snapped
at
the
in
a
way
quite
unusual
with
her
and
wace
the
butler
a
serious
man
went
about
his
duties
as
if
been
getting
ready
for
a
funeral
he
was
a
great
wace
was
and
had
a
beautiful
assortment
of
texts
at
his
command
but
that
day
he
used
such
dreadful
language
that
i
was
about
to
leave
the
table
when
he
assured
me
it
was
all
out
of
isaiah
and
i
noticed
that
whenever
the
master
came
wace
took
to
the
prophets
about
seven
agnes
called
me
to
my
mistress
room
and
there
i
found
brympton
he
was
standing
on
the
hearth
a
big
fair
man
with
a
red
face
and
little
blue
eyes
the
kind
of
man
a
young
simpleton
might
have
thought
handsome
and
would
have
been
like
to
pay
dear
for
thinking
it
he
swung
about
when
i
came
in
and
looked
me
over
in
a
trice
i
knew
what
the
look
meant
from
having
experienced
it
once
or
twice
in
my
former
places
then
he
turned
his
back
on
me
and
went
on
talking
to
his
wife
and
i
knew
what
meant
too
i
was
not
the
kind
of
morsel
he
was
after
the
typhoid
had
served
me
well
enough
in
one
way
it
kept
that
kind
of
gentleman
at
this
is
my
new
maid
hartley
says
brympton
in
her
kind
voice
and
he
nodded
and
went
on
with
what
he
was
saying
in
a
minute
or
two
he
went
off
and
left
my
mistress
to
dress
for
dinner
and
i
noticed
as
i
waited
on
her
that
she
was
white
and
chill
to
the
touch
brympton
took
himself
off
the
next
morning
and
the
whole
house
drew
a
long
breath
when
he
drove
away
as
for
my
mistress
she
put
on
her
hat
and
furs
for
it
was
a
fine
winter
morning
and
went
out
for
a
walk
in
the
gardens
coming
back
quite
fresh
and
rosy
so
that
for
a
minute
before
her
color
faded
i
could
guess
what
a
pretty
young
lady
she
must
have
been
and
not
so
long
ago
either
she
had
met
ranford
in
the
grounds
and
the
two
came
back
together
i
remember
smiling
and
talking
as
they
walked
along
the
terrace
under
my
window
that
was
the
first
time
i
saw
ranford
though
i
had
often
heard
his
name
mentioned
in
the
hall
he
was
a
neighbor
it
appeared
living
a
mile
or
two
beyond
brympton
at
the
end
of
the
village
and
as
he
was
in
the
habit
of
spending
his
winters
in
the
country
he
was
almost
the
only
company
my
mistress
had
at
that
season
he
was
a
slight
tall
gentleman
of
about
thirty
and
i
thought
him
rather
till
i
saw
his
smile
which
had
a
kind
of
surprise
in
it
like
the
first
warm
day
in
spring
he
was
a
great
reader
i
heard
like
my
mistress
and
the
two
were
forever
borrowing
books
of
one
another
and
sometimes
wace
told
me
he
would
read
aloud
to
brympton
by
the
hour
in
the
big
dark
library
where
she
sat
in
the
winter
afternoons
the
servants
all
liked
him
and
perhaps
that
more
of
a
compliment
than
the
masters
suspect
he
had
a
friendly
word
for
every
one
of
us
and
we
were
all
glad
to
think
that
brympton
had
a
pleasant
companionable
gentleman
like
that
to
keep
her
company
when
the
master
was
away
ranford
seemed
on
excellent
terms
with
brympton
too
though
i
could
but
wonder
that
two
gentlemen
so
unlike
each
other
should
be
so
friendly
but
then
i
knew
how
the
real
quality
can
keep
their
feelings
to
themselves
as
for
brympton
he
came
and
went
never
staying
more
than
a
day
or
two
cursing
the
dulness
and
the
solitude
grumbling
at
everything
and
as
i
soon
found
out
drinking
a
deal
more
than
was
good
for
him
after
brympton
left
the
table
he
would
sit
half
the
night
over
the
old
brympton
port
and
madeira
and
once
as
i
was
leaving
my
room
rather
later
than
usual
i
met
him
coming
up
the
stairs
in
such
a
state
that
i
turned
sick
to
think
of
what
some
ladies
have
to
endure
and
hold
their
tongues
about
the
servants
said
very
little
about
their
master
but
from
what
they
let
drop
i
could
see
it
had
been
an
unhappy
match
from
the
beginning
brympton
was
coarse
loud
and
my
mistress
quiet
retiring
and
perhaps
a
trifle
cold
not
that
she
was
not
always
to
him
i
thought
her
wonderfully
forbearing
but
to
a
gentleman
as
free
as
brympton
i
daresay
she
seemed
a
little
offish
well
things
went
on
quietly
for
several
weeks
my
mistress
was
kind
my
duties
were
light
and
i
got
on
well
with
the
other
servants
in
short
i
had
nothing
to
complain
of
yet
there
was
always
a
weight
on
me
i
ca
say
why
it
was
so
but
i
know
it
was
not
the
loneliness
that
i
felt
i
soon
got
used
to
that
and
being
still
languid
from
the
fever
i
was
thankful
for
the
quiet
and
the
good
country
air
nevertheless
i
was
never
quite
easy
in
my
mind
my
mistress
knowing
i
had
been
ill
insisted
that
i
should
take
my
walk
regular
and
often
invented
errands
for
me
a
yard
of
ribbon
to
be
fetched
from
the
village
a
letter
posted
or
a
book
returned
to
ranford
as
soon
as
i
was
out
of
doors
my
spirits
rose
and
i
looked
forward
to
my
walks
through
the
bare
woods
but
the
moment
i
caught
sight
of
the
house
again
my
heart
dropped
down
like
a
stone
in
a
well
it
was
not
a
gloomy
house
exactly
yet
i
never
entered
it
but
a
feeling
of
gloom
came
over
me
brympton
seldom
went
out
in
winter
only
on
the
finest
days
did
she
walk
an
hour
at
noon
on
the
south
terrace
excepting
ranford
we
had
no
visitors
but
the
doctor
who
drove
over
from
d
about
once
a
week
he
sent
for
me
once
or
twice
to
give
me
some
trifling
direction
about
my
mistress
and
though
he
never
told
me
what
her
illness
was
i
thought
from
a
waxy
look
she
had
now
and
then
of
a
morning
that
it
might
be
the
heart
that
ailed
her
the
season
was
soft
and
unwholesome
and
in
january
we
had
a
long
spell
of
rain
that
was
a
sore
trial
to
me
i
own
for
i
could
go
out
and
sitting
over
my
sewing
all
day
listening
to
the
drip
drip
of
the
eaves
i
grew
so
nervous
that
the
least
sound
made
me
jump
somehow
the
thought
of
that
locked
room
across
the
passage
began
to
weigh
on
me
once
or
twice
in
the
long
rainy
nights
i
fancied
i
heard
noises
there
but
that
was
nonsense
of
course
and
the
daylight
drove
such
notions
out
of
my
head
well
one
morning
brympton
gave
me
quite
a
start
of
pleasure
by
telling
me
she
wished
me
to
go
to
town
for
some
shopping
i
had
known
till
then
how
low
my
spirits
had
fallen
i
set
off
in
high
glee
and
my
first
sight
of
the
crowded
streets
and
the
shops
quite
took
me
out
of
myself
toward
afternoon
however
the
noise
and
confusion
began
to
tire
me
and
i
was
actually
looking
forward
to
the
quiet
of
brympton
and
thinking
how
i
should
enjoy
the
drive
home
through
the
dark
woods
when
i
ran
across
an
old
acquaintance
a
maid
i
had
once
been
in
service
with
we
had
lost
sight
of
each
other
for
a
number
of
years
and
i
had
to
stop
and
tell
her
what
had
happened
to
me
in
the
interval
when
i
mentioned
where
i
was
living
she
rolled
up
her
eyes
and
pulled
a
long
face
what
the
brympton
that
lives
all
the
year
at
her
place
on
the
hudson
my
dear
you
wo
stay
there
three
months
oh
but
i
do
mind
the
country
says
i
offended
somehow
at
her
tone
since
the
fever
i
glad
to
be
quiet
she
shook
her
head
it
not
the
country
i
thinking
of
all
i
know
is
she
had
four
maids
in
the
last
six
months
and
the
last
one
who
was
a
friend
of
mine
told
me
nobody
could
stay
in
the
house
did
she
say
why
i
asked
no
she
would
give
me
her
reason
but
she
says
to
me
she
says
ever
a
young
woman
as
you
know
of
thinks
of
going
there
you
tell
her
it
not
worth
while
to
unpack
her
is
she
young
and
handsome
said
i
thinking
of
brympton
not
her
she
the
kind
that
mothers
engage
when
they
gay
young
gentlemen
at
college
well
though
i
knew
the
woman
was
an
idle
gossip
the
words
stuck
in
my
head
and
my
heart
sank
lower
than
ever
as
i
drove
up
to
brympton
in
the
dusk
there
something
about
the
house
i
was
sure
of
it
now
when
i
went
in
to
tea
i
heard
that
brympton
had
arrived
and
i
saw
at
a
glance
that
there
had
been
a
disturbance
of
some
kind
blinder
hand
shook
so
that
she
could
hardly
pour
the
tea
and
wace
quoted
the
most
dreadful
texts
full
of
brimstone
nobody
said
a
word
to
me
then
but
when
i
went
up
to
my
room
blinder
followed
me
oh
my
dear
says
she
taking
my
hand
i
so
glad
and
thankful
you
come
back
to
us
that
struck
me
as
you
may
imagine
why
said
i
did
you
think
i
was
leaving
for
good
no
no
to
be
sure
said
she
a
little
confused
but
i
ca
to
have
madam
left
alone
for
a
day
even
she
pressed
my
hand
hard
and
oh
miss
hartley
says
she
be
good
to
your
mistress
as
a
christian
woman
and
with
that
she
hurried
away
and
left
me
staring
a
moment
later
agnes
called
me
to
brympton
hearing
voice
in
her
room
i
went
round
by
the
thinking
i
would
lay
out
her
before
going
in
the
is
a
large
room
with
a
window
over
the
portico
that
looks
toward
the
gardens
brympton
apartments
are
beyond
when
i
went
in
the
door
into
the
bedroom
was
ajar
and
i
heard
brympton
saying
angrily
one
would
suppose
he
was
the
only
person
fit
for
you
to
talk
to
i
do
have
many
visitors
in
winter
brympton
answered
quietly
you
have
he
flung
at
her
sneering
you
are
here
so
seldom
said
she
well
whose
fault
is
that
you
make
the
place
about
as
lively
as
a
family
vault
with
that
i
rattled
the
to
give
my
mistress
warning
and
she
rose
and
called
me
in
the
two
dined
alone
as
usual
and
i
knew
by
wace
manner
at
supper
that
things
must
be
going
badly
he
quoted
the
prophets
something
terrible
and
worked
on
the
so
that
she
declared
she
would
go
down
alone
to
put
the
cold
meat
in
the
i
felt
nervous
myself
and
after
i
had
put
my
mistress
to
bed
i
was
to
go
down
again
and
persuade
blinder
to
sit
up
awhile
over
a
game
of
cards
but
i
heard
her
door
closing
for
the
night
and
so
i
went
on
to
my
own
room
the
rain
had
begun
again
and
the
drip
drip
drip
seemed
to
be
dropping
into
my
brain
i
lay
awake
listening
to
it
and
turning
over
what
my
friend
in
town
had
said
what
puzzled
me
was
that
it
was
always
the
maids
who
left
after
a
while
i
slept
but
suddenly
a
loud
noise
wakened
me
my
bell
had
rung
i
sat
up
terrified
by
the
unusual
sound
which
seemed
to
go
on
jangling
through
the
darkness
my
hands
shook
so
that
i
find
the
matches
at
length
i
struck
a
light
and
jumped
out
of
bed
i
began
to
think
i
must
have
been
dreaming
but
i
looked
at
the
bell
against
the
wall
and
there
was
the
little
hammer
still
quivering
i
was
just
beginning
to
huddle
on
my
clothes
when
i
heard
another
sound
this
time
it
was
the
door
of
the
locked
room
opposite
mine
softly
opening
and
closing
i
heard
the
sound
distinctly
and
it
frightened
me
so
that
i
stood
stock
still
then
i
heard
a
footstep
hurrying
down
the
passage
toward
the
main
house
the
floor
being
carpeted
the
sound
was
very
faint
but
i
was
quite
sure
it
was
a
woman
step
i
turned
cold
with
the
thought
of
it
and
for
a
minute
or
two
i
durs
breathe
or
move
then
i
came
to
my
senses
alice
hartley
says
i
to
myself
someone
left
that
room
just
now
and
ran
down
the
passage
ahead
of
you
the
idea
is
pleasant
but
you
may
as
well
face
it
your
mistress
has
rung
for
you
and
to
answer
her
bell
you
got
to
go
the
way
that
other
woman
has
gone
well
i
did
it
i
never
walked
faster
in
my
life
yet
i
thought
i
should
never
get
to
the
end
of
the
passage
or
reach
room
on
the
way
i
heard
nothing
and
saw
nothing
all
was
dark
and
quiet
as
the
grave
when
i
reached
my
mistress
door
the
silence
was
so
deep
that
i
began
to
think
i
must
be
dreaming
and
was
to
turn
back
then
a
panic
seized
me
and
i
knocked
there
was
no
answer
and
i
knocked
again
loudly
to
my
astonishment
the
door
was
opened
by
brympton
he
started
back
when
he
saw
me
and
in
the
light
of
my
candle
his
face
looked
red
and
savage
you
he
said
in
a
queer
voice
how
many
of
you
are
there
in
god
name
at
that
i
felt
the
ground
give
under
me
but
i
said
to
myself
that
he
had
been
drinking
and
answered
as
steadily
as
i
could
may
i
go
in
sir
brympton
has
rung
for
me
you
may
all
go
in
for
what
i
care
says
he
and
pushing
by
me
walked
down
the
hall
to
his
own
bedroom
i
looked
after
him
as
he
went
and
to
my
surprise
i
saw
that
he
walked
as
straight
as
a
sober
man
i
found
my
mistress
lying
very
weak
and
still
but
she
forced
a
smile
when
she
saw
me
and
signed
to
me
to
pour
out
some
drops
for
her
after
that
she
lay
without
speaking
her
breath
coming
quick
and
her
eyes
closed
suddenly
she
groped
out
with
her
hand
and
says
she
faintly
it
hartley
madam
i
said
do
you
want
anything
she
opened
her
eyes
wide
and
gave
me
a
startled
look
i
was
dreaming
she
said
you
may
go
now
hartley
and
thank
you
kindly
i
quite
well
again
you
see
and
she
turned
her
face
away
from
me
iii
there
was
no
more
sleep
for
me
that
night
and
i
was
thankful
when
daylight
came
soon
afterward
agnes
called
me
to
brympton
i
was
afraid
she
was
ill
again
for
she
seldom
sent
for
me
before
nine
but
i
found
her
sitting
up
in
bed
pale
and
but
quite
herself
hartley
says
she
quickly
will
you
put
on
your
things
at
once
and
go
down
to
the
village
for
me
i
want
this
prescription
made
up
here
she
hesitated
a
minute
and
blushed
and
i
should
like
you
to
be
back
again
before
brympton
is
up
certainly
madam
i
said
and
stay
a
moment
she
called
me
back
as
if
an
idea
had
just
struck
her
while
you
waiting
for
the
mixture
you
have
time
to
go
on
to
ranford
with
this
note
it
was
a
walk
to
the
village
and
on
my
way
i
had
time
to
turn
things
over
in
my
mind
it
struck
me
as
peculiar
that
my
mistress
should
wish
the
prescription
made
up
without
brympton
knowledge
and
putting
this
together
with
the
scene
of
the
night
before
and
with
much
else
that
i
had
noticed
and
suspected
i
began
to
wonder
if
the
poor
lady
was
weary
of
her
life
and
had
come
to
the
mad
resolve
of
ending
it
the
idea
took
such
hold
on
me
that
i
reached
the
village
on
a
run
and
dropped
breathless
into
a
chair
before
the
counter
the
good
man
who
was
just
taking
down
his
shutters
stared
at
me
so
hard
that
it
brought
me
to
myself
limmel
i
says
trying
to
speak
indifferent
will
you
run
your
eye
over
this
and
tell
me
if
it
quite
right
he
put
on
his
spectacles
and
studied
the
prescription
why
it
one
of
walton
says
he
what
should
be
wrong
with
it
well
is
it
dangerous
to
take
dangerous
how
do
you
mean
i
could
have
shaken
the
man
for
his
stupidity
i
mean
if
a
person
was
to
take
too
much
of
it
by
mistake
of
course
says
i
my
heart
in
my
throat
lord
bless
you
no
it
only
you
might
feed
it
to
a
baby
by
the
bottleful
i
gave
a
great
sigh
of
relief
and
hurried
on
to
ranford
but
on
the
way
another
thought
struck
me
if
there
was
nothing
to
conceal
about
my
visit
to
the
chemist
was
it
my
other
errand
that
brympton
wished
me
to
keep
private
somehow
that
thought
frightened
me
worse
than
the
other
yet
the
two
gentlemen
seemed
fast
friends
and
i
would
have
staked
my
head
on
my
mistress
goodness
i
felt
ashamed
of
my
suspicions
and
concluded
that
i
was
still
disturbed
by
the
strange
events
of
the
night
i
left
the
note
at
ranford
and
hurrying
back
to
brympton
slipped
in
by
a
side
door
without
being
seen
as
i
thought
an
hour
later
however
as
i
was
carrying
in
my
mistress
breakfast
i
was
stopped
in
the
hall
by
brympton
what
were
you
doing
out
so
early
he
says
looking
hard
at
me
early
me
sir
i
said
in
a
tremble
come
come
he
says
an
angry
red
spot
coming
out
on
his
forehead
did
i
see
you
scuttling
home
through
the
shrubbery
an
hour
or
more
ago
i
a
truthful
woman
by
nature
but
at
that
a
lie
popped
out
no
sir
you
did
said
i
and
looked
straight
back
at
him
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
gave
a
sullen
laugh
i
suppose
you
think
i
was
drunk
last
night
he
asked
suddenly
no
sir
i
do
i
answered
this
time
truthfully
enough
he
turned
away
with
another
shrug
a
pretty
notion
my
servants
have
of
me
i
heard
him
mutter
as
he
walked
off
not
till
i
had
settled
down
to
my
afternoon
sewing
did
i
realize
how
the
events
of
the
night
had
shaken
me
i
could
pass
that
locked
door
without
a
shiver
i
knew
i
had
heard
someone
come
out
of
it
and
walk
down
the
passage
ahead
of
me
i
thought
of
speaking
to
blinder
or
to
wace
the
only
two
in
the
house
who
appeared
to
have
an
inkling
of
what
was
going
on
but
i
had
a
feeling
that
if
i
questioned
them
they
would
deny
everything
and
that
i
might
learn
more
by
holding
my
tongue
and
keeping
my
eyes
open
the
idea
of
spending
another
night
opposite
the
locked
room
sickened
me
and
once
i
was
seized
with
the
notion
of
packing
my
trunk
and
taking
the
first
train
to
town
but
it
was
in
me
to
throw
over
a
kind
mistress
in
that
manner
and
i
tried
to
go
on
with
my
sewing
as
if
nothing
had
happened
i
had
worked
ten
minutes
before
the
broke
down
it
was
one
i
had
found
in
the
house
a
good
machine
but
a
trifle
out
of
order
blinder
said
it
had
never
been
used
since
emma
death
i
stopped
to
see
what
was
wrong
and
as
i
was
working
at
the
machine
a
drawer
which
i
had
never
been
able
to
open
slid
forward
and
a
photograph
fell
out
i
picked
it
up
and
sat
looking
at
it
in
a
maze
it
was
a
woman
likeness
and
i
knew
i
had
seen
the
face
somewhere
the
eyes
had
an
asking
look
that
i
had
felt
on
me
before
and
suddenly
i
remembered
the
pale
woman
in
the
passage
i
stood
up
cold
all
over
and
ran
out
of
the
room
my
heart
seemed
to
be
thumping
in
the
top
of
my
head
and
i
felt
as
if
i
should
never
get
away
from
the
look
in
those
eyes
i
went
straight
to
blinder
she
was
taking
her
afternoon
nap
and
sat
up
with
a
jump
when
i
came
in
blinder
said
i
who
is
that
and
i
held
out
the
photograph
she
rubbed
her
eyes
and
stared
why
emma
saxon
says
she
where
did
you
find
it
i
looked
hard
at
her
for
a
minute
blinder
i
said
i
seen
that
face
before
blinder
got
up
and
walked
over
to
the
dear
me
i
must
have
been
asleep
she
says
my
front
is
all
over
one
ear
and
now
do
run
along
miss
hartley
dear
for
i
hear
the
clock
striking
four
and
i
must
go
down
this
very
minute
and
put
on
the
virginia
ham
for
brympton
dinner
iv
to
all
appearances
things
went
on
as
usual
for
a
week
or
two
the
only
difference
was
that
brympton
stayed
on
instead
of
going
off
as
he
usually
did
and
that
ranford
never
showed
himself
i
heard
brympton
remark
on
this
one
afternoon
when
he
was
sitting
in
my
mistress
room
before
dinner
where
ranford
says
he
he
has
been
near
the
house
for
a
week
does
he
keep
away
because
i
here
brympton
spoke
so
low
that
i
could
catch
her
answer
well
he
went
on
two
company
and
three
trumpery
i
sorry
to
be
in
ranford
way
and
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
take
myself
off
again
in
a
day
or
two
and
give
him
a
show
and
he
laughed
at
his
own
joke
the
very
next
day
as
it
happened
ranford
called
the
footman
said
the
three
were
very
merry
over
their
tea
in
the
library
and
brympton
strolled
down
to
the
gate
with
ranford
when
he
left
i
have
said
that
things
went
on
as
usual
and
so
they
did
with
the
rest
of
the
household
but
as
for
myself
i
had
never
been
the
same
since
the
night
my
bell
had
rung
night
after
night
i
used
to
lie
awake
listening
for
it
to
ring
again
and
for
the
door
of
the
locked
room
to
open
stealthily
but
the
bell
never
rang
and
i
heard
no
sound
across
the
passage
at
last
the
silence
began
to
be
more
dreadful
to
me
than
the
most
mysterious
sounds
i
felt
that
were
cowering
there
behind
the
locked
door
watching
and
listening
as
i
watched
and
listened
and
i
could
almost
have
cried
out
whoever
you
are
come
out
and
let
me
see
you
face
to
face
but
do
lurk
there
and
spy
on
me
in
the
darkness
feeling
as
i
did
you
may
wonder
i
did
give
warning
once
i
very
nearly
did
so
but
at
the
last
moment
something
held
me
back
whether
it
was
compassion
for
my
mistress
who
had
grown
more
and
more
dependent
on
me
or
unwillingness
to
try
a
new
place
or
some
other
feeling
that
i
could
put
a
name
to
i
lingered
on
as
if
though
every
night
was
dreadful
to
me
and
the
days
but
little
better
for
one
thing
i
did
like
brympton
looks
she
had
never
been
the
same
since
that
night
no
more
than
i
had
i
thought
she
would
brighten
up
after
brympton
left
but
though
she
seemed
easier
in
her
mind
her
spirits
did
revive
nor
her
strength
either
she
had
grown
attached
to
me
and
seemed
to
like
to
have
me
about
and
agnes
told
me
one
day
that
since
emma
saxon
death
i
was
the
only
maid
her
mistress
had
taken
to
this
gave
me
a
warm
feeling
for
the
poor
lady
though
after
all
there
was
little
i
could
do
to
help
her
after
brympton
departure
ranford
took
to
coming
again
though
less
often
than
formerly
i
met
him
once
or
twice
in
the
grounds
or
in
the
village
and
i
could
but
think
there
was
a
change
in
him
too
but
i
set
it
down
to
my
disordered
fancy
the
weeks
passed
and
brympton
had
now
been
a
month
absent
we
heard
he
was
cruising
with
a
friend
in
the
west
indies
and
wace
said
that
was
a
long
way
off
but
though
you
had
the
wings
of
a
dove
and
went
to
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
earth
you
could
get
away
from
the
almighty
agnes
said
that
as
long
as
he
stayed
away
from
brympton
the
almighty
might
have
him
and
welcome
and
this
raised
a
laugh
though
blinder
tried
to
look
shocked
and
wace
said
the
bears
would
eat
us
we
were
all
glad
to
hear
that
the
west
indies
were
a
long
way
off
and
i
remember
that
in
spite
of
wace
solemn
looks
we
had
a
very
merry
dinner
that
day
in
the
hall
i
do
know
if
it
was
because
of
my
being
in
better
spirits
but
i
fancied
brympton
looked
better
too
and
seemed
more
cheerful
in
her
manner
she
had
been
for
a
walk
in
the
morning
and
after
luncheon
she
lay
down
in
her
room
and
i
read
aloud
to
her
when
she
dismissed
me
i
went
to
my
own
room
feeling
quite
bright
and
happy
and
for
the
first
time
in
weeks
walked
past
the
locked
door
without
thinking
of
it
as
i
sat
down
to
my
work
i
looked
out
and
saw
a
few
falling
the
sight
was
pleasanter
than
the
eternal
rain
and
i
pictured
to
myself
how
pretty
the
bare
gardens
would
look
in
their
white
mantle
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
the
snow
would
cover
up
all
the
dreariness
indoors
as
well
as
out
the
fancy
had
hardly
crossed
my
mind
when
i
heard
a
step
at
my
side
i
looked
up
thinking
it
was
agnes
well
agnes
said
i
and
the
words
froze
on
my
tongue
for
there
in
the
door
stood
emma
saxon
i
do
know
how
long
she
stood
there
i
only
know
i
could
stir
or
take
my
eyes
from
her
afterward
i
was
terribly
frightened
but
at
the
time
it
was
fear
i
felt
but
something
deeper
and
quieter
she
looked
at
me
long
and
long
and
her
face
was
just
one
dumb
prayer
to
me
but
how
in
the
world
was
i
to
help
her
suddenly
she
turned
and
i
heard
her
walk
down
the
passage
this
time
i
was
afraid
to
follow
i
felt
that
i
must
know
what
she
wanted
i
sprang
up
and
ran
out
she
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
passage
and
i
expected
her
to
take
the
turn
toward
my
mistress
room
but
instead
of
that
she
pushed
open
the
door
that
led
to
the
backstairs
i
followed
her
down
the
stairs
and
across
the
passageway
to
the
back
door
the
kitchen
and
hall
were
empty
at
that
hour
the
servants
being
off
duty
except
for
the
footman
who
was
in
the
pantry
at
the
door
she
stood
still
a
moment
with
another
look
at
me
then
she
turned
the
handle
and
stepped
out
for
a
minute
i
hesitated
where
was
she
leading
me
to
the
door
had
closed
softly
after
her
and
i
opened
it
and
looked
out
to
find
that
she
had
disappeared
but
i
saw
her
a
few
yards
off
hurrying
across
the
to
the
path
through
the
woods
her
figure
looked
black
and
lonely
in
the
snow
and
for
a
second
my
heart
failed
me
and
i
thought
of
turning
back
but
all
the
while
she
was
drawing
me
after
her
and
catching
up
an
old
shawl
of
blinder
i
ran
out
into
the
open
emma
saxon
was
in
the
now
she
walked
on
steadily
and
i
followed
at
the
same
pace
till
we
passed
out
of
the
gates
and
reached
the
then
she
struck
across
the
open
fields
to
the
village
by
this
time
the
ground
was
white
and
as
she
climbed
the
slope
of
a
bare
hill
ahead
of
me
i
noticed
that
she
left
no
behind
her
at
sight
of
that
my
heart
shrivelled
up
within
me
and
my
knees
were
water
somehow
it
was
worse
here
than
indoors
she
made
the
whole
countryside
seem
lonely
as
the
grave
with
none
but
us
two
in
it
and
no
help
in
the
wide
world
once
i
tried
to
go
back
but
she
turned
and
looked
at
me
and
it
was
as
if
she
had
dragged
me
with
ropes
after
that
i
followed
her
like
a
dog
we
came
to
the
village
and
she
led
me
through
it
past
the
church
and
the
blacksmith
shop
and
down
the
lane
to
ranford
ranford
house
stands
close
to
the
road
a
plain
building
with
a
flagged
path
leading
to
the
door
between
the
lane
was
deserted
and
as
i
turned
into
it
i
saw
emma
saxon
pause
under
the
old
elm
by
the
gate
and
now
another
fear
came
over
me
i
saw
that
we
had
reached
the
end
of
our
journey
and
that
it
was
my
turn
to
act
all
the
way
from
brympton
i
had
been
asking
myself
what
she
wanted
of
me
but
i
had
followed
in
a
trance
as
it
were
and
not
till
i
saw
her
stop
at
ranford
gate
did
my
brain
begin
to
clear
itself
it
stood
a
little
way
off
in
the
snow
my
heart
beating
fit
to
strangle
me
and
my
feet
frozen
to
the
ground
and
she
stood
under
the
elm
and
watched
me
i
knew
well
enough
that
she
had
led
me
there
for
nothing
i
felt
there
was
something
i
ought
to
say
or
do
but
how
was
i
to
guess
what
it
was
i
had
never
thought
harm
of
my
mistress
and
ranford
but
i
was
sure
now
that
from
one
cause
or
another
some
dreadful
thing
hung
over
them
knew
what
it
was
she
would
tell
me
if
she
could
perhaps
she
would
answer
if
i
questioned
her
it
turned
me
faint
to
think
of
speaking
to
her
but
i
plucked
up
heart
and
dragged
myself
across
the
few
yards
between
us
as
i
did
so
i
heard
the
open
and
saw
ranford
approaching
he
looked
handsome
and
cheerful
as
my
mistress
had
looked
that
morning
and
at
sight
of
him
the
blood
began
to
flow
again
in
my
veins
why
hartley
said
he
what
the
matter
i
saw
you
coming
down
the
lane
just
now
and
came
out
to
see
if
you
had
taken
root
in
the
snow
he
stopped
and
stared
at
me
what
are
you
looking
at
he
says
i
turned
toward
the
elm
as
he
spoke
and
his
eyes
followed
me
but
there
was
no
one
there
the
lane
was
empty
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
a
sense
of
helplessness
came
over
me
she
was
gone
and
i
had
not
been
able
to
guess
what
she
wanted
her
last
look
had
pierced
me
to
the
marrow
and
yet
it
had
not
told
me
all
at
once
i
felt
more
desolate
than
when
she
had
stood
there
watching
me
it
seemed
as
if
she
had
left
me
all
alone
to
carry
the
weight
of
the
secret
i
could
guess
the
snow
went
round
me
in
great
circles
and
the
ground
fell
away
from
me
a
drop
of
brandy
and
the
warmth
of
ranford
fire
soon
brought
me
to
and
i
insisted
on
being
driven
back
at
once
to
brympton
it
was
nearly
dark
and
i
was
afraid
my
mistress
might
be
wanting
me
i
explained
to
ranford
that
i
had
been
out
for
a
walk
and
had
been
taken
with
a
fit
of
giddiness
as
i
passed
his
gate
this
was
true
enough
yet
i
never
felt
more
like
a
liar
than
when
i
said
it
when
i
dressed
brympton
for
dinner
she
remarked
on
my
pale
looks
and
asked
what
ailed
me
i
told
her
i
had
a
headache
and
she
said
she
would
not
require
me
again
that
evening
and
advised
me
to
go
to
bed
it
was
a
fact
that
i
could
scarcely
keep
on
my
feet
yet
i
had
no
fancy
to
spend
a
solitary
evening
in
my
room
i
sat
downstairs
in
the
hall
as
long
as
i
could
hold
my
head
up
but
by
nine
i
crept
upstairs
too
weary
to
care
what
happened
if
i
could
but
get
my
head
on
a
pillow
the
rest
of
the
household
went
to
bed
soon
afterward
they
kept
early
hours
when
the
master
was
away
and
before
ten
i
heard
blinder
door
close
and
wace
soon
after
it
was
a
very
still
night
earth
and
air
all
muffled
in
snow
once
in
bed
i
felt
easier
and
lay
quiet
listening
to
the
strange
noises
that
come
out
in
a
house
after
dark
once
i
thought
i
heard
a
door
open
and
close
again
below
it
might
have
been
the
glass
door
that
led
to
the
gardens
i
got
up
and
peered
out
of
the
window
but
it
was
in
the
dark
of
the
moon
and
nothing
visible
outside
but
the
streaking
of
snow
against
the
panes
i
went
back
to
bed
and
must
have
dozed
for
i
jumped
awake
to
the
furious
ringing
of
my
bell
before
my
head
was
clear
i
had
sprung
out
of
bed
and
was
dragging
on
my
clothes
is
going
to
happen
i
heard
myself
saying
but
what
i
meant
i
had
no
notion
my
hands
seemed
to
be
covered
with
glue
i
thought
i
should
never
get
into
my
clothes
at
last
i
opened
my
door
and
peered
down
the
passage
as
far
as
my
carried
i
could
see
nothing
unusual
ahead
of
me
i
hurried
on
breathless
but
as
i
pushed
open
the
baize
door
leading
to
the
main
hall
my
heart
stood
still
for
there
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
was
emma
saxon
peering
dreadfully
down
into
the
darkness
for
a
second
i
could
stir
but
my
hand
slipped
from
the
door
and
as
it
swung
shut
the
figure
vanished
at
the
same
instant
there
came
another
sound
from
below
stairs
a
stealthy
mysterious
sound
as
of
a
turning
in
the
i
ran
to
brympton
room
and
knocked
there
was
no
answer
and
i
knocked
again
this
time
i
heard
some
one
moving
in
the
room
the
bolt
slipped
back
and
my
mistress
stood
before
me
to
my
surprise
i
saw
that
she
had
not
undressed
for
the
night
she
gave
me
a
startled
look
what
is
this
hartley
she
says
in
a
whisper
are
you
ill
what
are
you
doing
here
at
this
hour
i
am
not
ill
madam
but
my
bell
rang
at
that
she
turned
pale
and
seemed
about
to
fall
you
are
mistaken
she
said
harshly
i
did
ring
you
must
have
been
dreaming
i
had
never
heard
her
speak
in
such
a
tone
go
back
to
bed
she
said
closing
the
door
on
me
but
as
she
spoke
i
heard
sounds
again
in
the
hall
below
a
man
step
this
time
and
the
truth
leaped
out
on
me
madam
i
said
pushing
past
her
there
is
someone
in
the
house
someone
brympton
i
think
i
hear
his
step
below
a
dreadful
look
came
over
her
and
without
a
word
she
dropped
flat
at
my
feet
i
fell
on
my
knees
and
tried
to
lift
her
by
the
way
she
breathed
i
saw
it
was
no
common
faint
but
as
i
raised
her
head
there
came
quick
steps
on
the
stairs
and
across
the
hall
the
door
was
flung
open
and
there
stood
brympton
in
his
the
snow
dripping
from
him
he
drew
back
with
a
start
as
he
saw
me
kneeling
by
my
mistress
what
the
devil
is
this
he
shouted
he
was
less
than
usual
and
the
red
spot
came
out
on
his
forehead
brympton
has
fainted
sir
said
i
he
laughed
unsteadily
and
pushed
by
me
it
a
pity
she
did
choose
a
more
convenient
moment
i
sorry
to
disturb
her
but
i
raised
myself
up
aghast
at
the
man
action
sir
said
i
are
you
mad
what
are
you
doing
going
to
meet
a
friend
said
he
and
seemed
to
make
for
the
at
that
my
heart
turned
over
i
do
know
what
i
thought
or
feared
but
i
sprang
up
and
caught
him
by
the
sleeve
sir
sir
said
i
for
pity
sake
look
at
your
wife
he
shook
me
off
furiously
it
seems
that
done
for
me
says
he
and
caught
hold
of
the
door
at
that
moment
i
heard
a
slight
noise
inside
slight
as
it
was
he
heard
it
too
and
tore
the
door
open
but
as
he
did
so
he
dropped
back
on
the
threshold
stood
emma
saxon
all
was
dark
behind
her
but
i
saw
her
plainly
and
so
did
he
he
threw
up
his
hands
as
if
to
hide
his
face
from
her
and
when
i
looked
again
she
was
gone
he
stood
motionless
as
if
the
strength
had
run
out
of
him
and
in
the
stillness
my
mistress
suddenly
raised
herself
and
opening
her
eyes
fixed
a
look
on
him
then
she
fell
back
and
i
saw
the
pass
over
her
we
buried
her
on
the
third
day
in
a
driving
there
were
few
people
in
the
church
for
it
was
bad
weather
to
come
from
town
and
i
a
notion
my
mistress
was
one
that
had
many
near
friends
ranford
was
among
the
last
to
come
just
before
they
carried
her
up
the
aisle
he
was
in
black
of
course
being
such
a
friend
of
the
family
and
i
never
saw
a
gentleman
so
pale
as
he
passed
me
i
noticed
that
he
leaned
a
trifle
on
a
stick
he
carried
and
i
fancy
brympton
noticed
it
too
for
the
red
spot
came
out
sharp
on
his
forehead
and
all
through
the
service
he
kept
staring
across
the
church
at
ranford
instead
of
following
the
prayers
as
a
mourner
should
when
it
was
over
and
we
went
out
to
the
graveyard
ranford
had
disappeared
and
as
soon
as
my
poor
mistress
body
was
underground
brympton
jumped
into
the
carriage
nearest
the
gate
and
drove
off
without
a
word
to
any
of
us
i
heard
him
call
out
to
the
station
and
we
servants
went
back
alone
to
the
house
the
mission
of
jane
i
lethbury
surveying
his
wife
across
the
dinner
table
found
his
transient
conjugal
glance
arrested
by
an
indefinable
change
in
her
appearance
how
smart
you
look
is
that
a
new
gown
he
asked
her
answering
look
seemed
to
deprecate
his
charging
her
with
the
extravagance
of
wasting
a
new
gown
on
him
and
he
now
perceived
that
the
change
lay
deeper
than
any
accident
of
dress
at
the
same
time
he
noticed
that
she
betrayed
her
consciousness
of
it
by
a
delicate
almost
frightened
blush
it
was
one
of
the
compensations
of
protracted
childishness
that
she
still
blushed
as
prettily
as
at
eighteen
her
body
had
been
privileged
not
to
outstrip
her
mind
and
the
two
as
it
seemed
to
lethbury
were
destined
to
travel
together
through
an
eternity
of
girlishness
i
do
know
what
you
mean
she
said
since
she
never
did
he
always
wondered
at
her
bringing
this
out
as
a
fresh
grievance
against
him
but
his
wonder
was
unresentful
and
he
said
you
sparkle
so
that
i
thought
you
had
on
your
diamonds
she
sighed
and
blushed
again
it
must
be
he
continued
that
you
been
to
a
opening
you
absolutely
brimming
with
illicit
enjoyment
she
stared
again
this
time
at
the
adjective
his
adjectives
always
embarrassed
her
their
unintelligibleness
savored
of
impropriety
in
short
he
summed
up
you
been
doing
something
that
thoroughly
ashamed
of
to
his
surprise
she
retorted
i
do
see
why
i
should
be
ashamed
of
it
lethbury
leaned
back
with
a
smile
of
enjoyment
when
there
was
nothing
better
going
he
always
liked
to
listen
to
her
explanations
well
he
said
she
was
becoming
breathless
and
ejaculatory
of
course
laugh
you
laugh
at
everything
that
rather
blunts
the
point
of
my
derision
does
it
he
interjected
but
she
rushed
on
without
noticing
it
so
easy
to
laugh
at
things
ah
murmured
lethbury
with
relish
that
aunt
sophronia
it
most
of
his
wife
opinions
were
heirlooms
and
he
took
a
quaint
pleasure
in
tracing
their
descent
she
was
proud
of
their
age
and
saw
no
reason
for
discarding
them
while
they
were
still
serviceable
some
of
course
were
so
fine
that
she
kept
them
for
state
occasions
like
her
crown
derby
but
from
the
lady
known
as
aunt
sophronia
she
had
inherited
a
stout
set
of
prejudices
that
were
practically
as
good
as
new
whereas
her
husband
as
she
noticed
were
always
having
to
be
replaced
in
the
early
days
she
had
fancied
there
might
be
a
certain
satisfaction
in
taxing
him
with
the
fact
but
she
had
long
since
been
silenced
by
the
reply
my
dear
i
not
a
rich
man
but
i
never
use
an
opinion
twice
if
i
can
help
it
she
was
reduced
therefore
to
dwelling
on
his
moral
deficiencies
and
one
of
the
most
obvious
of
these
was
his
refusal
to
take
things
seriously
on
this
occasion
however
some
ulterior
purpose
kept
her
from
taking
up
his
taunt
i
not
in
the
least
ashamed
she
repeated
with
the
air
of
shaking
a
banner
to
the
wind
but
the
domestic
atmosphere
being
calm
the
banner
drooped
unheroically
that
said
lethbury
judicially
encourages
me
to
infer
that
you
ought
to
be
and
that
consequently
you
been
giving
yourself
the
unusual
pleasure
of
doing
something
i
should
approve
of
she
met
this
with
an
almost
solemn
directness
no
she
said
you
wo
approve
of
it
i
allowed
for
that
ah
he
exclaimed
setting
down
his
you
worked
out
the
whole
problem
eh
i
believe
so
that
uncommonly
interesting
and
what
is
it
she
looked
at
him
quietly
a
baby
if
it
was
seldom
given
her
to
surprise
him
she
had
attained
the
distinction
for
once
a
baby
yes
a
human
baby
of
course
she
cried
with
the
virtuous
resentment
of
the
woman
who
has
never
allowed
dogs
in
the
house
lethbury
puzzled
stare
broke
into
a
fresh
smile
a
baby
i
approve
of
well
in
the
abstract
i
do
think
much
of
them
i
admit
is
this
an
abstract
baby
again
she
frowned
at
the
adjective
but
she
had
reached
a
pitch
of
exaltation
at
which
such
obstacles
could
not
deter
her
it
the
loveliest
baby
she
murmured
ah
then
it
concrete
it
exists
in
this
harsh
world
it
draws
its
breath
in
pain
it
the
healthiest
child
i
ever
saw
she
indignantly
corrected
you
seen
it
then
again
the
accusing
blush
suffused
her
yes
i
seen
it
and
to
whom
does
the
paragon
belong
and
here
indeed
she
confounded
him
to
me
i
hope
she
declared
he
pushed
his
chair
back
with
an
inarticulate
murmur
to
to
she
corrected
good
lord
he
said
if
there
had
been
the
least
hint
of
hallucination
in
her
transparent
gaze
but
no
it
was
as
clear
as
shallow
as
easily
fathomable
as
when
he
had
first
suffered
the
sharp
surprise
of
striking
bottom
in
it
it
occurred
to
him
that
perhaps
she
was
trying
to
be
funny
he
knew
that
there
is
nothing
more
cryptic
than
the
humor
of
the
unhumorous
is
it
a
joke
he
faltered
oh
i
hope
not
i
want
it
so
much
to
be
a
reality
he
paused
to
smile
at
the
limitations
of
a
world
in
which
jokes
were
not
realities
and
continued
gently
but
since
it
is
one
already
to
us
i
mean
to
you
and
me
i
want
her
voice
wavered
and
her
eyes
with
it
i
have
always
wanted
so
dreadfully
it
has
been
such
a
disappointment
not
to
i
see
said
lethbury
slowly
but
he
had
not
seen
before
it
seemed
curious
now
that
he
had
never
thought
of
her
taking
it
in
that
way
had
never
surmised
any
hidden
depths
beneath
her
outspread
obviousness
he
felt
as
though
he
had
touched
a
secret
spring
in
her
mind
there
was
a
moment
silence
moist
and
tremulous
on
her
part
awkward
and
slightly
irritated
on
his
you
been
lonely
i
suppose
he
began
it
was
odd
having
suddenly
to
reckon
with
the
stranger
who
gazed
at
him
out
of
her
trivial
eyes
at
times
she
said
i
sorry
it
was
not
your
fault
a
man
has
so
many
occupations
and
women
who
are
clever
or
very
handsome
i
suppose
that
an
occupation
too
sometimes
i
felt
that
when
dinner
was
ordered
i
had
nothing
to
do
till
the
next
day
oh
he
groaned
it
was
your
fault
she
insisted
i
never
told
you
but
when
i
chose
that
paper
for
the
front
room
upstairs
i
always
thought
well
it
would
be
such
a
pretty
paper
for
a
baby
to
wake
up
in
that
was
years
ago
of
course
but
it
was
rather
an
expensive
paper
and
it
has
faded
in
the
least
she
broke
off
incoherently
it
has
faded
no
and
so
i
thought
as
we
do
use
the
room
for
anything
now
that
aunt
sophronia
is
dead
i
thought
i
might
you
might
oh
julian
if
you
could
only
have
seen
it
just
waking
up
in
its
crib
seen
what
where
you
have
got
a
baby
upstairs
oh
no
not
she
said
with
her
rare
laugh
the
girlish
bubbling
of
merriment
that
had
seemed
one
of
her
chief
graces
in
the
early
days
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
had
not
given
her
enough
things
to
laugh
about
lately
but
then
she
needed
such
very
elementary
things
it
was
as
difficult
to
amuse
her
as
a
savage
he
concluded
that
he
was
not
sufficiently
simple
alice
he
said
almost
solemnly
what
you
mean
she
hesitated
a
moment
he
saw
her
gather
her
courage
for
a
supreme
effort
then
she
said
slowly
gravely
as
though
she
were
pronouncing
a
sacramental
phrase
i
so
lonely
without
a
little
child
and
i
thought
perhaps
you
let
me
adopt
one
at
the
hospital
its
mother
is
dead
and
i
could
pet
it
and
dress
it
and
do
things
for
it
and
it
such
a
good
baby
you
can
ask
any
of
the
nurses
it
would
never
bother
you
by
crying
ii
lethbury
accompanied
his
wife
to
the
hospital
in
a
mood
of
chastened
wonder
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
oppose
her
wish
he
knew
of
course
that
he
would
have
to
bear
the
brunt
of
the
situation
the
jokes
at
the
club
the
inquiries
the
explanations
he
saw
himself
in
the
comic
role
of
the
adopted
father
and
welcomed
it
as
an
expiation
for
in
his
rapid
reconstruction
of
the
past
he
found
himself
cutting
a
shabbier
figure
than
he
cared
to
admit
he
had
always
been
intolerant
of
stupid
people
and
it
was
his
punishment
to
be
convicted
of
stupidity
as
his
mind
traversed
the
years
between
his
marriage
and
this
unexpected
assumption
of
paternity
he
saw
in
the
light
of
an
overheated
imagination
many
signs
of
unwonted
crassness
it
was
not
that
he
had
ceased
to
think
his
wife
stupid
she
stupid
limited
inflexible
but
there
was
a
pathos
in
the
struggles
of
her
swaddled
mind
in
its
blind
reachings
toward
the
primal
emotions
he
had
always
thought
she
would
have
been
happier
with
a
child
but
he
had
thought
it
mechanically
because
it
had
so
often
been
thought
before
because
it
was
in
the
nature
of
things
to
think
it
of
every
woman
because
his
wife
was
so
eminently
one
of
a
species
that
she
fitted
into
all
the
generalizations
on
the
sex
but
he
had
regarded
this
generalization
as
merely
typical
of
the
triumph
of
tradition
over
experience
maternity
was
no
doubt
the
supreme
function
of
primitive
woman
the
one
end
to
which
her
whole
organism
tended
but
the
law
of
increasing
complexity
had
operated
in
both
sexes
and
he
had
not
seriously
supposed
that
outside
the
world
of
christmas
fiction
and
anecdotic
art
such
truisms
had
any
special
hold
on
the
feminine
imagination
now
he
saw
that
the
arts
in
question
were
kept
alive
by
the
vitality
of
the
sentiments
they
appealed
to
lethbury
was
in
fact
going
through
a
rapid
process
of
readjustment
his
marriage
had
been
a
failure
but
he
had
preserved
toward
his
wife
the
exact
fidelity
of
act
that
is
sometimes
supposed
to
excuse
any
divagation
of
feeling
so
that
for
years
the
tie
between
them
had
consisted
mainly
in
his
abstaining
from
making
love
to
other
women
the
abstention
had
not
always
been
easy
for
the
world
is
surprisingly
with
the
kind
of
woman
one
ought
to
have
married
but
did
not
and
lethbury
had
not
escaped
the
solicitation
of
such
alternatives
his
immunity
had
been
purchased
at
the
cost
of
taking
refuge
in
the
somewhat
rarified
atmosphere
of
his
perceptions
and
his
world
being
thus
limited
he
had
given
unusual
care
to
its
details
compensating
himself
for
the
narrowness
of
his
horizon
by
the
minute
finish
of
his
foreground
it
was
a
world
of
fine
shadings
and
the
nicest
proportions
where
impulse
seldom
set
a
blundering
foot
and
the
feast
of
reason
was
undisturbed
by
an
intemperate
flow
of
soul
to
such
a
banquet
his
wife
naturally
remained
uninvited
the
diet
would
have
disagreed
with
her
and
she
would
probably
have
objected
to
the
other
guests
but
lethbury
miscalculating
her
needs
had
hitherto
supposed
that
he
had
made
ample
provision
for
them
and
was
consequently
at
liberty
to
enjoy
his
own
fare
without
any
reproach
of
mendicancy
at
his
gates
now
he
beheld
her
pressing
a
starved
face
against
the
windows
of
his
life
and
in
his
imaginative
reaction
he
invested
her
with
a
pathos
borrowed
from
the
sense
of
his
own
shortcomings
in
the
hospital
the
imaginative
process
continued
with
increasing
force
he
looked
at
his
wife
with
new
eyes
formerly
she
had
been
to
him
a
mere
bundle
of
negations
a
labyrinth
of
dead
walls
and
bolted
doors
there
was
nothing
behind
the
walls
and
the
doors
led
he
had
sounded
and
listened
often
enough
to
be
sure
of
that
now
he
felt
like
a
traveller
who
exploring
some
ancient
ruin
comes
on
an
inner
cell
intact
amid
the
general
dilapidation
and
painted
with
images
which
reveal
the
forgotten
uses
of
the
building
his
wife
stood
by
a
white
crib
in
one
of
the
wards
in
the
crib
lay
a
child
a
year
old
the
nurse
affirmed
but
to
lethbury
eye
a
mere
dateless
fragment
of
humanity
projected
against
a
background
of
conjecture
over
this
anonymous
particle
of
life
lethbury
leaned
such
ecstasy
reflected
in
her
face
as
strikes
up
in
from
the
child
body
to
the
mother
countenance
it
was
a
light
that
irradiated
and
dazzled
her
she
looked
up
at
an
inquiry
of
lethbury
but
as
their
glances
met
he
perceived
that
she
no
longer
saw
him
that
he
had
become
as
invisible
to
her
as
she
had
long
been
to
him
he
had
to
transfer
his
question
to
the
nurse
what
is
the
child
name
he
asked
we
call
her
jane
said
the
nurse
iii
lethbury
at
first
had
resisted
the
idea
of
a
legal
adoption
but
when
he
found
that
his
wife
curiously
limited
imagination
prevented
her
regarding
the
child
as
hers
till
it
had
been
made
so
by
process
of
law
he
promptly
withdrew
his
objection
on
one
point
only
he
remained
inflexible
and
that
was
the
changing
of
the
waif
name
lethbury
almost
at
once
had
expressed
a
wish
to
rechristen
it
she
fluctuated
between
muriel
and
gladys
deferring
the
moment
of
decision
like
a
lady
wavering
between
two
bonnets
but
lethbury
was
unyielding
in
the
general
surrender
of
his
prejudices
this
one
alone
held
out
but
jane
is
so
dreadful
lethbury
protested
well
we
do
know
that
wo
be
dreadful
she
may
grow
up
a
jane
his
wife
exclaimed
reproachfully
the
nurse
says
she
the
loveliest
do
they
always
say
that
asked
lethbury
patiently
he
was
prepared
to
be
inexhaustibly
patient
now
that
he
had
reached
a
firm
foothold
of
opposition
it
cruel
to
call
her
jane
lethbury
pleaded
it
ridiculous
to
call
her
muriel
the
nurse
is
she
must
be
a
lady
child
lethbury
winced
he
had
tried
all
along
to
keep
his
mind
off
the
question
of
antecedents
well
let
her
prove
it
he
said
with
a
rising
sense
of
exasperation
he
wondered
how
he
could
ever
have
allowed
himself
to
be
drawn
into
such
a
ridiculous
business
for
the
first
time
he
felt
the
full
irony
of
it
he
had
visions
of
coming
home
in
the
afternoon
to
a
house
smelling
of
linseed
and
paregoric
and
of
being
greeted
by
a
chronic
howl
as
he
went
up
stairs
to
dress
for
dinner
he
had
never
been
a
but
he
saw
himself
becoming
one
now
the
worst
of
his
anticipations
were
unfulfilled
the
baby
was
surprisingly
well
and
surprisingly
quiet
such
infantile
remedies
as
she
absorbed
were
not
potent
enough
to
be
perceived
beyond
the
nursery
and
when
lethbury
could
be
induced
to
enter
that
sanctuary
there
was
nothing
to
jar
his
nerves
in
the
mild
pink
presence
of
his
adopted
daughter
jars
there
were
indeed
they
were
probably
inevitable
in
the
disturbed
routine
of
the
household
but
they
occurred
between
lethbury
and
the
nurses
and
jane
contributed
to
them
only
a
placid
stare
which
might
have
served
as
a
rebuke
to
the
combatants
in
the
reaction
from
his
first
impulse
of
atonement
lethbury
noted
with
sharpened
perceptions
the
effect
of
the
change
on
his
character
he
saw
already
the
error
of
supposing
that
it
could
work
any
transformation
in
her
it
simply
magnified
her
existing
qualities
she
was
like
a
dried
sponge
put
in
water
she
expanded
but
she
did
not
change
her
shape
from
the
of
scientific
observation
it
was
curious
to
see
how
her
stored
instincts
responded
to
the
call
she
overflowed
with
the
petty
maxims
of
the
occasion
one
felt
in
her
the
epitome
the
consummation
of
centuries
of
animal
maternity
so
that
this
little
woman
who
screamed
at
a
mouse
and
was
nervous
about
burglars
came
to
typify
the
rending
her
prey
for
her
young
it
was
less
easy
to
regard
philosophically
the
practical
effects
of
her
borrowed
motherhood
lethbury
found
with
surprise
that
she
was
becoming
assertive
and
definite
she
no
longer
represented
the
negative
side
of
his
life
she
showed
indeed
a
tendency
to
inconvenient
affirmations
she
had
gradually
expanded
her
assumption
of
motherhood
till
it
included
his
own
share
in
the
relation
and
he
suddenly
found
himself
regarded
as
the
father
of
jane
this
was
a
contingency
he
had
not
foreseen
and
it
took
all
his
philosophy
to
accept
it
but
there
were
moments
of
compensation
for
lethbury
was
undoubtedly
happy
for
the
first
time
in
years
and
the
thought
that
he
had
tardily
contributed
to
this
end
reconciled
him
to
the
irony
of
the
means
at
first
he
was
inclined
to
reproach
himself
for
still
viewing
the
situation
from
the
outside
for
remaining
a
spectator
instead
of
a
participant
he
had
been
allured
for
a
moment
by
the
vision
of
severed
hands
meeting
over
a
cradle
as
the
whole
body
of
domestic
fiction
bears
witness
to
their
doing
and
the
fact
that
no
such
conjunction
took
place
he
could
explain
only
on
the
ground
that
it
was
a
borrowed
cradle
he
did
not
dislike
the
little
girl
she
still
remained
to
him
a
hypothetical
presence
a
query
rather
than
a
fact
but
her
nearness
was
not
unpleasant
and
there
were
moments
when
her
tentative
utterances
her
groping
steps
seemed
to
loosen
the
dry
accretions
enveloping
his
inner
self
but
even
at
such
moments
moments
which
he
invited
and
caressed
she
did
not
bring
him
nearer
to
his
wife
he
now
perceived
that
he
had
made
a
certain
place
in
his
life
for
lethbury
and
that
she
no
longer
fitted
into
it
it
was
too
late
to
enlarge
the
space
and
so
she
overflowed
and
encroached
lethbury
struggled
against
the
sense
of
submergence
he
let
down
barrier
after
barrier
yielded
privacy
after
privacy
but
his
wife
personality
continued
to
dilate
she
was
no
longer
herself
alone
she
was
herself
and
jane
gradually
in
a
monstrous
fusion
of
identity
she
became
herself
himself
and
jane
and
instead
of
trying
to
adapt
her
to
a
spare
crevice
of
his
character
he
found
himself
carelessly
squeezed
into
the
smallest
compartment
of
the
domestic
economy
iv
he
continued
to
tell
himself
that
he
was
satisfied
if
his
wife
was
happy
and
it
was
not
till
the
child
tenth
year
that
he
felt
a
doubt
of
her
happiness
jane
had
been
a
preternaturally
good
child
during
the
eight
years
of
her
adoption
she
had
caused
her
no
anxiety
beyond
those
connected
with
the
usual
succession
of
youthful
diseases
but
her
unknown
progenitors
had
given
her
a
robust
constitution
and
she
passed
unperturbed
through
measles
and
if
there
was
any
suffering
it
was
endured
vicariously
by
lethbury
whose
temperature
rose
and
fell
with
the
patient
and
who
could
not
hear
jane
sneeze
without
visions
of
a
marble
angel
weeping
over
a
broken
column
but
though
jane
prompt
recoveries
continued
to
belie
such
premonitions
though
her
existence
continued
to
move
forward
on
an
even
keel
of
good
health
and
good
conduct
lethbury
satisfaction
showed
no
corresponding
advance
lethbury
at
first
was
disposed
to
add
her
disappointment
to
the
long
list
of
feminine
inconsistencies
with
which
the
sententious
observer
of
life
builds
up
his
favorite
induction
but
circumstances
presently
led
him
to
take
a
kindlier
view
of
the
case
hitherto
his
wife
had
regarded
him
as
a
negligible
factor
in
evolution
beyond
providing
for
his
adopted
daughter
and
effacing
himself
before
her
he
was
not
expected
to
contribute
to
her
but
as
time
passed
he
appeared
to
his
wife
in
a
new
light
it
was
he
who
was
to
educate
jane
in
matters
of
the
intellect
lethbury
was
the
first
to
declare
her
deficiencies
to
proclaim
them
even
with
a
certain
virtuous
superiority
she
said
she
did
not
pretend
to
be
clever
and
there
was
no
denying
the
truth
of
the
assertion
now
however
she
seemed
less
ready
not
to
own
her
limitations
but
to
glory
in
them
confronted
with
the
problem
of
jane
instruction
she
stood
in
awe
of
the
child
i
have
always
been
stupid
you
know
she
said
to
lethbury
with
a
new
humility
and
i
afraid
i
know
what
is
best
for
jane
sure
she
has
a
wonderfully
good
mind
and
i
should
reproach
myself
if
i
did
give
her
every
opportunity
she
looked
at
him
helplessly
you
must
tell
me
what
ought
to
be
done
lethbury
was
not
unwilling
to
oblige
her
somewhere
in
his
mental
there
rusted
a
theory
of
education
such
as
usually
lingers
among
the
impedimenta
of
the
childless
he
brought
this
out
refurbished
it
and
applied
it
to
jane
at
first
he
thought
his
wife
had
not
overrated
the
quality
of
the
child
mind
jane
seemed
extraordinarily
intelligent
her
precocious
definiteness
of
mind
was
encouraging
to
her
inexperienced
preceptor
she
had
no
difficulty
in
fixing
her
attention
and
he
felt
that
every
fact
he
imparted
was
being
etched
in
metal
he
helped
his
wife
to
engage
the
best
teachers
and
for
a
while
continued
to
take
an
interest
in
his
adopted
daughter
studies
but
gradually
his
interest
waned
jane
ideas
did
not
increase
with
her
acquisitions
her
young
mind
remained
a
mere
receptacle
for
facts
a
kind
of
from
which
anything
that
had
been
put
there
could
be
taken
out
at
a
moment
notice
intact
but
congealed
she
developed
moreover
an
inordinate
pride
in
the
capacity
of
her
mental
storehouse
and
a
tendency
to
pelt
her
public
with
its
contents
she
was
overheard
to
jeer
at
her
nurse
for
not
knowing
when
the
saxon
heptarchy
had
fallen
and
she
alternately
dazzled
and
depressed
lethbury
by
the
wealth
of
her
chronological
allusions
she
showed
no
interest
in
the
significance
of
the
facts
she
amassed
she
simply
collected
dates
as
another
child
might
have
collected
stamps
or
marbles
to
her
she
seemed
a
prodigy
of
wisdom
but
lethbury
saw
with
a
secret
movement
of
sympathy
how
the
aptitudes
in
which
lethbury
gloried
were
slowly
estranging
her
from
their
possessor
she
is
getting
too
clever
for
me
his
wife
said
to
him
after
one
of
jane
historical
flights
but
i
am
so
glad
that
she
will
be
a
companion
to
you
lethbury
groaned
in
spirit
he
did
not
look
forward
to
companionship
she
was
still
a
good
little
girl
but
there
was
something
automatic
and
formal
in
her
goodness
as
though
it
were
a
kind
of
moral
calisthenics
that
she
went
through
for
the
sake
of
showing
her
agility
an
early
consciousness
of
virtue
had
moreover
constituted
her
the
natural
guardian
and
adviser
of
her
elders
before
she
was
fifteen
she
had
set
about
reforming
the
household
she
took
lethbury
in
hand
first
then
she
extended
her
efforts
to
the
servants
with
consequences
more
disastrous
to
the
domestic
harmony
and
lastly
she
applied
herself
to
lethbury
she
proved
to
him
by
statistics
that
he
smoked
too
much
and
that
it
was
injurious
to
the
optic
nerve
to
read
in
bed
she
took
him
to
task
for
not
going
to
church
more
regularly
and
pointed
out
to
him
the
evils
of
desultory
reading
she
suggested
that
a
regular
course
of
study
encourages
mental
concentration
and
hinted
that
inconsecutiveness
of
thought
is
a
sign
of
approaching
age
to
her
adopted
mother
her
suggestions
were
equally
pertinent
she
instructed
lethbury
in
an
improved
way
of
making
beef
stock
and
called
her
attention
to
the
unhygienic
qualities
of
carpets
she
poured
out
distracting
facts
about
bacilli
and
vegetable
mould
and
demonstrated
that
curtains
and
are
a
of
animal
organisms
she
learned
by
heart
the
nutritive
ingredients
of
the
principal
articles
of
diet
and
revolutionized
the
cuisine
by
an
attempt
to
establish
a
scientific
average
between
starch
and
phosphates
four
cooks
left
during
this
experiment
and
lethbury
fell
into
the
habit
of
dining
at
his
club
once
or
twice
at
the
outset
he
had
tried
to
check
jane
ardor
but
his
efforts
resulted
only
in
hurting
his
wife
feelings
jane
remained
impervious
and
lethbury
resented
any
attempt
to
protect
her
from
her
daughter
lethbury
saw
that
she
was
consoled
for
the
sense
of
her
own
inferiority
by
the
thought
of
what
jane
intellectual
companionship
must
be
to
him
and
he
tried
to
keep
up
the
illusion
by
enduring
with
what
grace
he
might
the
blighting
edification
of
discourse
v
as
jane
grew
up
he
sometimes
avenged
himself
by
wondering
if
his
wife
was
still
sorry
that
they
had
not
called
her
muriel
jane
was
not
ugly
she
developed
indeed
a
kind
of
categorical
prettiness
that
might
have
been
a
projection
of
her
mind
she
had
a
creditable
collection
of
features
but
one
had
to
take
an
inventory
of
them
to
find
out
that
she
was
the
fusing
grace
had
been
omitted
lethbury
took
a
touching
pride
in
her
daughter
first
steps
in
the
world
she
expected
jane
to
take
by
her
complexion
those
whom
she
did
not
capture
by
her
learning
but
jane
rosy
freshness
did
not
work
any
perceptible
ravages
whether
the
young
men
guessed
the
axioms
on
her
lips
and
detected
the
encyclopaedia
in
her
eye
or
whether
they
simply
found
no
intrinsic
interest
in
these
features
certain
it
is
that
in
spite
of
her
mother
heroic
efforts
and
of
incessant
calls
on
lethbury
purse
jane
at
the
end
of
her
first
season
had
dropped
hopelessly
out
of
the
running
a
few
duller
girls
found
her
interesting
and
one
or
two
young
men
came
to
the
house
with
the
object
of
meeting
other
young
women
but
she
was
rapidly
becoming
one
of
the
social
supernumeraries
who
are
asked
out
only
because
they
are
on
people
lists
the
blow
was
bitter
to
lethbury
but
she
consoled
herself
with
the
idea
that
jane
had
failed
because
she
was
too
clever
jane
probably
shared
this
conviction
at
all
events
she
betrayed
no
consciousness
of
failure
she
had
developed
a
pronounced
taste
for
society
and
went
out
unweariedly
and
obstinately
winter
after
winter
while
lethbury
toiled
in
her
wake
showering
attentions
on
oblivious
hostesses
to
lethbury
there
was
something
at
once
tragic
and
exasperating
in
the
sight
of
their
two
figures
the
one
conciliatory
the
other
dogged
both
pursuing
with
unabated
zeal
the
elusive
prize
of
popularity
he
even
began
to
feel
a
personal
stake
in
the
pursuit
not
as
it
concerned
jane
but
as
it
affected
his
wife
he
saw
that
the
latter
was
the
victim
of
jane
disappointment
that
jane
was
not
above
the
crude
satisfaction
of
taking
it
out
of
her
mother
experience
checked
the
impulse
to
come
to
his
wife
defence
and
when
his
resentment
was
at
its
height
jane
disarmed
him
by
giving
up
the
struggle
nothing
was
said
to
mark
her
capitulation
but
lethbury
noticed
that
the
visiting
ceased
and
that
the
dressmaker
bills
diminished
at
the
same
time
lethbury
made
it
known
that
jane
had
taken
up
charities
and
before
long
jane
conversation
confirmed
this
announcement
at
first
lethbury
congratulated
himself
on
the
change
but
jane
domesticity
soon
began
to
weigh
on
him
during
the
day
she
was
sometimes
absent
on
errands
of
mercy
but
in
the
evening
she
was
always
there
at
first
she
and
lethbury
sat
in
the
together
and
lethbury
smoked
in
the
library
but
presently
jane
formed
the
habit
of
joining
him
there
and
he
began
to
suspect
that
he
was
included
among
the
objects
of
her
philanthropy
lethbury
confirmed
the
suspicion
jane
has
grown
very
lately
she
said
she
imagines
that
she
used
to
neglect
you
and
she
is
trying
to
make
up
for
it
do
discourage
her
she
added
innocently
such
a
plea
delivered
lethbury
helpless
to
his
ministrations
and
he
found
himself
measuring
the
hours
he
spent
with
her
by
the
amount
of
relief
they
must
be
affording
her
mother
there
were
even
moments
when
he
read
a
furtive
gratitude
in
eye
but
lethbury
was
no
hero
and
he
had
nearly
reached
the
limit
of
vicarious
endurance
when
something
wonderful
happened
they
never
quite
knew
afterward
how
it
had
come
about
or
who
first
perceived
it
but
lethbury
one
day
gave
tremulous
voice
to
their
inferences
of
course
she
said
he
comes
here
because
of
elise
the
young
lady
in
question
a
friend
of
jane
was
possessed
of
attractions
which
had
already
been
found
to
explain
the
presence
of
masculine
visitors
lethbury
risked
a
denial
i
do
think
he
does
he
declared
but
elise
is
thought
very
pretty
lethbury
insisted
i
ca
help
that
said
lethbury
doggedly
he
saw
a
faint
light
in
his
wife
eyes
but
she
remarked
carelessly
budd
would
be
a
very
good
match
for
elise
lethbury
could
hardly
repress
a
chuckle
he
was
so
exquisitely
aware
that
she
was
trying
to
propitiate
the
gods
for
a
few
weeks
neither
said
a
word
then
lethbury
once
more
reverted
to
the
subject
it
is
a
month
since
elise
went
abroad
she
said
is
it
and
budd
seems
to
come
here
just
as
often
ah
said
lethbury
with
heroic
indifference
and
his
wife
hastily
changed
the
subject
winstanley
budd
was
a
young
man
who
suffered
from
an
excess
of
manner
politeness
gushed
from
him
in
the
driest
seasons
he
was
always
performing
feats
of
chivalry
and
the
approach
of
the
most
unobtrusive
female
threw
him
into
attitudes
which
endangered
the
furniture
his
features
being
of
the
cherubic
order
did
not
lend
themselves
to
this
role
but
there
were
moments
when
he
appeared
to
dominate
them
to
force
them
into
compliance
with
an
aquiline
ideal
the
range
of
budd
social
benevolence
made
its
object
hard
to
distinguish
he
spread
his
cloak
so
indiscriminately
that
one
could
not
always
interpret
the
gesture
and
jane
impassive
manner
had
the
effect
of
increasing
his
demonstrations
she
threw
him
into
paroxysms
of
politeness
at
first
he
filled
the
house
with
his
amenities
but
gradually
it
became
apparent
that
his
most
dazzling
effects
were
directed
exclusively
to
jane
lethbury
and
his
wife
held
their
breath
and
looked
away
from
each
other
they
pretended
not
to
notice
the
frequency
of
budd
visits
they
struggled
against
an
imprudent
inclination
to
leave
the
young
people
too
much
alone
their
conclusions
were
the
result
of
indirect
observation
for
neither
of
them
dared
to
be
caught
watching
budd
they
behaved
like
naturalists
on
the
trail
of
a
rare
butterfly
in
his
efforts
not
to
notice
budd
lethbury
centred
his
attentions
on
jane
and
jane
at
this
crucial
moment
wrung
from
him
a
reluctant
admiration
while
her
parents
went
about
dissembling
their
emotions
she
seemed
to
have
none
to
conceal
she
betrayed
neither
eagerness
nor
surprise
so
complete
was
her
unconcern
that
there
were
moments
when
lethbury
feared
it
was
obtuseness
when
he
could
hardly
help
whispering
to
her
that
now
was
the
moment
to
lower
the
net
meanwhile
the
velocity
of
budd
gyrations
increased
with
the
ardor
of
courtship
his
politeness
became
incandescent
and
jane
found
herself
the
centre
of
a
pyrotechnical
display
culminating
in
the
set
piece
of
an
offer
of
marriage
lethbury
imparted
the
news
to
her
husband
one
evening
after
their
daughter
had
gone
to
bed
the
announcement
was
made
and
received
with
an
air
of
detachment
as
though
both
feared
to
be
betrayed
into
unseemly
exultation
but
lethbury
as
his
wife
ended
could
not
repress
the
inquiry
have
they
decided
on
a
day
lethbury
superior
command
of
her
features
enabled
her
to
look
shocked
what
can
you
be
thinking
of
he
only
offered
himself
at
five
of
course
of
course
stammered
lethbury
but
nowadays
people
marry
after
such
short
engagements
engagement
said
his
wife
solemnly
there
is
no
engagement
lethbury
dropped
his
cigar
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
jane
is
thinking
it
over
thinking
it
over
she
has
asked
for
a
month
before
deciding
lethbury
sank
back
with
a
gasp
was
it
genius
or
was
it
madness
he
felt
incompetent
to
decide
and
lethbury
next
words
showed
that
she
shared
his
difficulty
of
course
i
do
want
to
hurry
jane
of
course
not
he
acquiesced
but
i
pointed
out
to
her
that
a
young
man
of
budd
impulsive
temperament
might
might
be
easily
discouraged
yes
and
what
did
she
say
she
said
that
if
she
was
worth
winning
she
was
worth
waiting
for
vi
the
period
of
budd
probation
could
scarcely
have
cost
him
as
much
mental
anguish
as
it
caused
his
lethbury
by
various
ruses
tried
to
shorten
the
ordeal
but
jane
remained
inexorable
and
each
morning
lethbury
came
down
to
breakfast
with
the
certainty
of
finding
a
letter
of
withdrawal
from
her
discouraged
suitor
when
at
length
the
decisive
day
came
and
lethbury
at
its
close
stole
into
the
library
with
an
air
of
chastened
joy
they
stood
for
a
moment
without
speaking
then
lethbury
paid
a
fitting
tribute
to
the
proprieties
by
faltering
out
it
will
be
dreadful
to
have
to
give
her
up
lethbury
could
not
repress
a
warning
gesture
but
even
as
it
escaped
him
he
realized
that
his
wife
grief
was
genuine
of
course
of
course
he
said
vainly
sounding
his
own
emotional
shallows
for
an
answering
regret
and
yet
it
was
his
wife
who
had
suffered
most
from
jane
he
had
fancied
that
these
sufferings
would
be
effaced
by
the
milder
atmosphere
of
their
last
weeks
together
but
felicity
did
not
soften
jane
not
for
a
moment
did
she
relax
her
dominion
she
simply
widened
it
to
include
a
new
subject
budd
found
himself
under
orders
with
the
others
and
a
new
fear
assailed
lethbury
as
he
saw
jane
assume
prenuptial
control
of
her
betrothed
lethbury
had
never
felt
any
strong
personal
interest
in
budd
but
as
jane
prospective
husband
the
young
man
excited
his
sympathy
to
his
surprise
he
found
that
lethbury
shared
the
feeling
i
afraid
he
may
find
jane
a
little
exacting
she
said
after
an
evening
dedicated
to
a
stormy
discussion
of
the
wedding
arrangements
she
really
ought
to
make
some
concessions
if
he
to
be
married
in
a
black
instead
of
a
dark
gray
one
she
paused
and
looked
doubtfully
at
lethbury
what
can
i
do
about
it
he
said
you
might
explain
to
him
tell
him
that
jane
is
always
lethbury
made
an
impatient
gesture
what
are
you
afraid
of
his
finding
her
out
or
his
not
finding
her
out
lethbury
flushed
you
put
it
so
dreadfully
her
husband
mused
for
a
moment
then
he
said
with
an
air
of
cheerful
hypocrisy
after
all
budd
is
old
enough
to
take
care
of
himself
but
the
next
day
lethbury
surprised
him
late
in
the
afternoon
she
entered
the
library
so
breathless
and
inarticulate
that
he
scented
a
catastrophe
i
done
it
she
cried
done
what
told
him
she
nodded
toward
the
door
he
just
gone
jane
is
out
and
i
had
a
chance
to
talk
to
him
alone
lethbury
pushed
a
chair
forward
and
she
sank
into
it
what
did
you
tell
him
that
she
is
always
lethbury
lifted
a
tragic
eye
no
i
told
him
that
she
always
always
yes
there
was
a
pause
lethbury
made
a
call
on
his
hoarded
philosophy
he
saw
jane
suddenly
reinstated
in
her
evening
seat
by
the
library
fire
but
an
answering
chord
in
him
thrilled
at
his
wife
heroism
well
what
did
he
say
lethbury
agitation
deepened
it
was
clear
that
the
blow
had
fallen
he
he
said
that
we
had
never
understood
jane
or
appreciated
her
the
final
syllables
were
lost
in
her
handkerchief
and
she
left
him
marvelling
at
the
mechanism
of
a
woman
after
that
lethbury
faced
the
future
with
an
undaunted
eye
they
had
done
their
duty
at
least
his
wife
had
done
hers
and
they
were
reaping
the
usual
harvest
of
ingratitude
with
a
zest
seldom
accorded
to
such
reaping
there
was
a
marked
change
in
budd
manner
and
his
increasing
coldness
sent
a
genial
glow
through
lethbury
system
it
was
easy
to
bear
with
jane
in
the
light
of
budd
disapproval
there
was
a
good
deal
to
be
borne
in
the
last
days
and
the
brunt
of
it
fell
on
lethbury
jane
marked
her
transition
to
the
married
state
by
an
appropriate
but
incongruous
display
of
nerves
she
became
sentimental
hysterical
and
reluctant
she
quarrelled
with
her
betrothed
and
threatened
to
return
the
ring
lethbury
had
to
intervene
and
lethbury
felt
the
hovering
sword
of
destiny
but
the
blow
was
suspended
budd
chivalry
was
proof
against
all
his
bride
caprices
and
his
devotion
throve
on
her
cruelty
lethbury
feared
that
he
was
too
faithful
too
enduring
and
longed
to
urge
him
to
vary
his
tactics
jane
presently
reappeared
with
the
ring
on
her
finger
and
consented
to
try
on
the
but
her
uncertainties
her
reactions
were
prolonged
till
the
final
day
when
it
dawned
lethbury
was
still
in
an
ecstasy
of
apprehension
feeling
reasonably
sure
of
the
principal
actors
he
had
centred
his
fears
on
incidental
possibilities
the
clergyman
might
have
a
stroke
or
the
church
might
burn
down
or
there
might
be
something
wrong
with
the
license
he
did
all
that
was
humanly
possible
to
avert
such
contingencies
but
there
remained
that
incalculable
factor
known
as
the
hand
of
god
lethbury
seemed
to
feel
it
groping
for
him
in
the
church
it
almost
had
him
by
the
nape
budd
was
late
and
for
five
immeasurable
minutes
lethbury
and
jane
faced
a
churchful
of
conjecture
then
the
bridegroom
appeared
flushed
but
chivalrous
and
explaining
to
his
under
cover
of
the
ritual
that
he
had
torn
his
glove
and
had
to
go
back
for
another
you
be
losing
the
ring
next
muttered
lethbury
but
budd
produced
this
article
punctually
and
a
moment
or
two
later
was
bearing
its
wearer
captive
down
the
aisle
at
the
lethbury
caught
his
wife
eye
fixed
on
him
in
mild
disapproval
and
understood
that
his
hilarity
was
exceeding
the
bounds
of
fitness
he
pulled
himself
together
and
tried
to
subdue
his
tone
but
his
jubilation
bubbled
over
like
a
perpetually
refilled
the
deeper
his
draughts
the
higher
it
rose
it
was
at
the
brim
when
in
the
wake
of
the
dispersing
guests
jane
came
down
in
her
and
fell
on
her
mother
neck
i
ca
leave
you
she
wailed
and
lethbury
felt
as
suddenly
sobered
as
a
man
under
a
douche
but
if
the
bride
was
reluctant
her
captor
was
relentless
never
had
budd
been
more
dominant
more
aquiline
lethbury
last
fears
were
dissipated
as
the
young
man
snatched
jane
from
her
mother
bosom
and
bore
her
off
to
the
brougham
the
brougham
rolled
away
the
last
milliner
girl
forsook
her
post
by
the
awning
the
red
carpet
was
folded
up
and
the
house
door
closed
lethbury
stood
alone
in
the
hall
with
his
wife
as
he
turned
toward
her
he
noticed
the
look
of
tired
heroism
in
her
eyes
the
deepened
lines
of
her
face
they
reflected
his
own
symptoms
too
accurately
not
to
appeal
to
him
the
nervous
tension
had
been
horrible
he
went
up
to
her
and
an
answering
impulse
made
her
lay
a
hand
on
his
arm
he
held
it
there
a
moment
let
us
go
off
and
have
a
jolly
little
dinner
at
a
restaurant
he
proposed
there
had
been
a
time
when
such
a
suggestion
would
have
surprised
her
to
the
verge
of
disapproval
but
now
she
agreed
to
it
at
once
oh
that
would
be
so
nice
she
murmured
with
a
great
sigh
of
relief
and
assuagement
jane
had
fulfilled
her
mission
after
all
she
had
drawn
them
together
at
last
the
reckoning
i
the
marriage
law
of
the
new
dispensation
will
be
shalt
not
be
unfaithful
to
a
discreet
murmur
of
approval
filled
the
studio
and
through
the
haze
of
cigarette
smoke
clement
westall
as
her
husband
descended
from
his
improvised
platform
saw
him
merged
in
a
congratulatory
group
of
ladies
westall
informal
talks
on
the
new
ethics
had
drawn
about
him
an
eager
following
of
the
mentally
unemployed
those
who
as
he
had
once
phrased
it
liked
to
have
their
cut
up
for
them
the
talks
had
begun
by
accident
westall
ideas
were
known
to
be
advanced
but
hitherto
their
advance
had
not
been
in
the
direction
of
publicity
he
had
been
in
his
wife
opinion
almost
pusillanimously
careful
not
to
let
his
personal
views
endanger
his
professional
standing
of
late
however
he
had
shown
a
puzzling
tendency
to
dogmatize
to
throw
down
the
gauntlet
to
flaunt
his
private
code
in
the
face
of
society
and
the
relation
of
the
sexes
being
a
topic
always
sure
of
an
audience
a
few
admiring
friends
had
persuaded
him
to
give
his
opinions
a
larger
circulation
by
summing
them
up
in
a
series
of
talks
at
the
van
sideren
studio
the
herbert
van
siderens
were
a
couple
who
subsisted
socially
on
the
fact
that
they
had
a
studio
van
sideren
pictures
were
chiefly
valuable
as
accessories
to
the
en
which
differentiated
his
wife
afternoons
from
the
blighting
functions
held
in
long
new
york
and
permitted
her
to
offer
their
friends
instead
of
tea
van
sideren
for
her
part
was
skilled
in
making
the
most
of
the
kind
of
atmosphere
which
a
and
an
easel
create
and
if
at
times
she
found
the
illusion
hard
to
maintain
and
lost
courage
to
the
extent
of
almost
wishing
that
herbert
could
paint
she
promptly
overcame
such
moments
of
weakness
by
calling
in
some
fresh
talent
some
extraneous
of
the
artistic
impression
it
was
in
quest
of
such
aid
that
she
had
seized
on
westall
coaxing
him
somewhat
to
his
wife
surprise
into
a
flattered
participation
in
her
fraud
it
was
vaguely
felt
in
the
van
sideren
circle
that
all
the
audacities
were
artistic
and
that
a
teacher
who
pronounced
marriage
immoral
was
somehow
as
distinguished
as
a
painter
who
depicted
purple
grass
and
a
green
sky
the
van
sideren
set
were
tired
of
the
conventional
in
art
and
conduct
julia
westall
had
long
had
her
own
views
on
the
immorality
of
marriage
she
might
indeed
have
claimed
her
husband
as
a
disciple
in
the
early
days
of
their
union
she
had
secretly
resented
his
disinclination
to
proclaim
himself
a
follower
of
the
new
creed
had
been
inclined
to
tax
him
with
moral
cowardice
with
a
failure
to
live
up
to
the
convictions
for
which
their
marriage
was
supposed
to
stand
that
was
in
the
first
burst
of
propagandism
when
womanlike
she
wanted
to
turn
her
disobedience
into
a
law
now
she
felt
differently
she
could
hardly
account
for
the
change
yet
being
a
woman
who
never
allowed
her
impulses
to
remain
unaccounted
for
she
tried
to
do
so
by
saying
that
she
did
not
care
to
have
the
articles
of
her
faith
misinterpreted
by
the
vulgar
in
this
connection
she
was
beginning
to
think
that
almost
every
one
was
vulgar
certainly
there
were
few
to
whom
she
would
have
cared
to
intrust
the
defence
of
so
esoteric
a
doctrine
and
it
was
precisely
at
this
point
that
westall
discarding
his
unspoken
principles
had
chosen
to
descend
from
the
heights
of
privacy
and
stand
hawking
his
convictions
at
the
it
was
una
van
sideren
who
on
this
occasion
unconsciously
focussed
upon
herself
westall
wandering
resentment
in
the
first
place
the
girl
had
no
business
to
be
there
it
was
horrid
westall
found
herself
slipping
back
into
the
old
feminine
vocabulary
simply
horrid
to
think
of
a
young
girl
being
allowed
to
listen
to
such
talk
the
fact
that
una
smoked
cigarettes
and
sipped
an
occasional
cocktail
did
not
in
the
least
tarnish
a
certain
radiant
innocency
which
made
her
appear
the
victim
rather
than
the
accomplice
of
her
vulgarities
julia
westall
felt
in
a
hot
helpless
way
that
something
ought
to
be
done
that
some
one
ought
to
speak
to
the
girl
mother
and
just
then
una
glided
up
oh
westall
how
beautiful
it
was
una
fixed
her
with
large
limpid
eyes
you
believe
it
all
i
suppose
she
asked
with
seraphic
gravity
all
what
my
dear
child
the
girl
shone
on
her
about
the
higher
life
the
freer
expansion
of
the
individual
the
law
of
fidelity
to
one
self
she
glibly
recited
westall
to
her
own
wonder
blushed
a
deep
and
burning
blush
my
dear
una
she
said
you
do
in
the
least
understand
what
all
about
miss
van
sideren
stared
with
a
slowly
answering
blush
do
then
she
murmured
westall
laughed
not
always
or
altogether
but
i
should
like
some
tea
please
una
led
her
to
the
corner
where
innocent
beverages
were
dispensed
as
julia
received
her
cup
she
scrutinized
the
girl
more
carefully
it
was
not
such
a
girlish
face
after
all
definite
lines
were
forming
under
the
rosy
haze
of
youth
she
reflected
that
una
must
be
and
wondered
why
she
had
not
married
a
nice
stock
of
ideas
she
would
have
as
her
dower
if
were
to
be
a
part
of
the
modern
trousseau
westall
caught
herself
up
with
a
start
it
was
as
though
some
one
else
had
been
speaking
a
stranger
who
had
borrowed
her
own
voice
she
felt
herself
the
dupe
of
some
fantastic
mental
ventriloquism
concluding
suddenly
that
the
room
was
stifling
and
una
tea
too
sweet
she
set
down
her
cup
and
looked
about
for
westall
to
meet
his
eyes
had
long
been
her
refuge
from
every
uncertainty
she
met
them
now
but
only
as
she
felt
in
transit
they
included
her
parenthetically
in
a
larger
flight
she
followed
the
flight
and
it
carried
her
to
a
corner
to
which
una
had
withdrawn
one
of
the
palmy
nooks
to
which
van
sideren
attributed
the
success
of
her
saturdays
westall
a
moment
later
had
overtaken
his
look
and
found
a
place
at
the
girl
side
she
bent
forward
speaking
eagerly
he
leaned
back
listening
with
the
depreciatory
smile
which
acted
as
a
filter
to
flattery
enabling
him
to
swallow
the
strongest
doses
without
apparent
grossness
of
appetite
julia
winced
at
her
own
definition
of
the
smile
on
the
way
home
in
the
deserted
winter
dusk
westall
surprised
his
wife
by
a
sudden
boyish
pressure
of
her
arm
did
i
open
their
eyes
a
bit
did
i
tell
them
what
you
wanted
me
to
he
asked
gaily
almost
unconsciously
she
let
her
arm
slip
from
his
what
wanted
why
have
you
all
this
time
she
caught
the
honest
wonder
of
his
tone
i
somehow
fancied
you
rather
blamed
me
for
not
talking
more
openly
before
you
made
me
feel
at
times
that
i
was
sacrificing
principles
to
expediency
she
paused
a
moment
over
her
reply
then
she
asked
quietly
what
made
you
decide
not
to
any
longer
she
felt
again
the
vibration
of
a
faint
surprise
why
the
wish
to
please
you
he
answered
almost
too
simply
i
wish
you
would
not
go
on
then
she
said
abruptly
he
stopped
in
his
quick
walk
and
she
felt
his
stare
through
the
darkness
not
go
on
call
a
hansom
please
i
tired
broke
from
her
with
a
sudden
rush
of
physical
weariness
instantly
his
solicitude
enveloped
her
the
room
had
been
infernally
hot
and
then
that
confounded
cigarette
smoke
he
had
noticed
once
or
twice
that
she
looked
pale
she
must
come
to
another
saturday
she
felt
herself
yielding
as
she
always
did
to
the
warm
influence
of
his
concern
for
her
the
feminine
in
her
leaning
on
the
man
in
him
with
a
conscious
intensity
of
abandonment
he
put
her
in
the
hansom
and
her
hand
stole
into
his
in
the
darkness
a
tear
or
two
rose
and
she
let
them
fall
it
was
so
delicious
to
cry
over
imaginary
troubles
that
evening
after
dinner
he
surprised
her
by
reverting
to
the
subject
of
his
talk
he
combined
a
man
dislike
of
uncomfortable
questions
with
an
almost
feminine
skill
in
eluding
them
and
she
knew
that
if
he
returned
to
the
subject
he
must
have
some
special
reason
for
doing
so
you
seem
not
to
have
cared
for
what
i
said
this
afternoon
did
i
put
the
case
badly
no
you
put
it
very
well
then
what
did
you
mean
by
saying
that
you
would
rather
not
have
me
go
on
with
it
she
glanced
at
him
nervously
her
ignorance
of
his
intention
deepening
her
sense
of
helplessness
i
do
think
i
care
to
hear
such
things
discussed
in
public
i
do
understand
you
he
exclaimed
again
the
feeling
that
his
surprise
was
genuine
gave
an
air
of
obliquity
to
her
own
attitude
she
was
not
sure
that
she
understood
herself
wo
you
explain
he
said
with
a
tinge
of
impatience
her
eyes
wandered
about
the
familiar
which
had
been
the
scene
of
so
many
of
their
evening
confidences
the
shaded
lamps
the
walls
hung
with
mezzotints
the
pale
spring
flowers
scattered
here
and
there
in
venice
glasses
and
bowls
of
old
sevres
recalled
she
hardly
knew
why
the
apartment
in
which
the
evenings
of
her
first
marriage
had
been
passed
a
wilderness
of
rosewood
and
upholstery
with
a
picture
of
a
roman
peasant
above
the
and
a
greek
slave
in
statuary
marble
between
the
of
the
back
it
was
a
room
with
which
she
had
never
been
able
to
establish
any
closer
relation
than
that
between
a
traveller
and
a
railway
station
and
now
as
she
looked
about
at
the
surroundings
which
stood
for
her
deepest
affinities
the
room
for
which
she
had
left
that
other
room
she
was
startled
by
the
same
sense
of
strangeness
and
unfamiliarity
the
prints
the
flowers
the
subdued
tones
of
the
old
porcelains
seemed
to
typify
a
superficial
refinement
that
had
no
relation
to
the
deeper
significances
of
life
suddenly
she
heard
her
husband
repeating
his
question
i
do
know
that
i
can
explain
she
faltered
he
drew
his
forward
so
that
he
faced
her
across
the
hearth
the
light
of
a
fell
on
his
finely
drawn
face
which
had
a
kind
of
akin
to
the
of
its
setting
is
it
that
you
no
longer
believe
in
our
ideas
he
asked
in
our
ideas
the
ideas
i
am
trying
to
teach
the
ideas
you
and
i
are
supposed
to
stand
for
he
paused
a
moment
the
ideas
on
which
our
marriage
was
founded
the
blood
rushed
to
her
face
he
had
his
reasons
then
she
was
sure
now
that
he
had
his
reasons
in
the
ten
years
of
their
marriage
how
often
had
either
of
them
stopped
to
consider
the
ideas
on
which
it
was
founded
how
often
does
a
man
dig
about
the
basement
of
his
house
to
examine
its
foundation
the
foundation
is
there
of
course
the
house
rests
on
it
but
one
lives
abovestairs
and
not
in
the
cellar
it
was
she
indeed
who
in
the
beginning
had
insisted
on
reviewing
the
situation
now
and
then
on
recapitulating
the
reasons
which
justified
her
course
on
proclaiming
from
time
to
time
her
adherence
to
the
religion
of
personal
independence
but
she
had
long
ceased
to
feel
the
need
of
any
such
ideal
standards
and
had
accepted
her
marriage
as
frankly
and
naturally
as
though
it
had
been
based
on
the
primitive
needs
of
the
heart
and
needed
no
special
sanction
to
explain
or
justify
it
of
course
i
still
believe
in
our
ideas
she
exclaimed
then
i
repeat
that
i
do
understand
it
was
a
part
of
your
theory
that
the
greatest
possible
publicity
should
be
given
to
our
view
of
marriage
have
you
changed
your
mind
in
that
respect
she
hesitated
it
depends
on
circumstances
on
the
public
one
is
addressing
the
set
of
people
that
the
van
siderens
get
about
them
do
care
for
the
truth
or
falseness
of
a
doctrine
they
are
attracted
simply
by
its
novelty
and
yet
it
was
in
just
such
a
set
of
people
that
you
and
i
met
and
learned
the
truth
from
each
other
that
was
different
i
thought
you
considered
it
one
of
the
deepest
social
wrongs
that
such
things
never
discussed
before
young
girls
but
that
is
beside
the
point
for
i
do
remember
seeing
any
young
girl
in
my
audience
except
una
van
sideren
he
turned
slightly
and
pushed
back
the
lamp
at
his
elbow
oh
miss
van
sideren
naturally
why
naturally
the
daughter
of
the
house
would
you
have
had
her
sent
out
with
her
governess
if
i
had
a
daughter
i
should
not
allow
such
things
to
go
on
in
my
house
westall
stroking
his
mustache
leaned
back
with
a
faint
smile
i
fancy
miss
van
sideren
is
quite
capable
of
taking
care
of
herself
no
girl
knows
how
to
take
care
of
herself
till
it
too
late
and
yet
you
would
deliberately
deny
her
the
surest
means
of
what
do
you
call
the
surest
means
of
some
preliminary
knowledge
of
human
nature
in
its
relation
to
the
marriage
tie
she
made
an
impatient
gesture
how
should
you
like
to
marry
that
kind
of
a
girl
immensely
if
she
were
my
kind
of
girl
in
other
respects
she
took
up
the
argument
at
another
point
you
are
quite
mistaken
if
you
think
such
talk
does
not
affect
young
girls
una
was
in
a
state
of
the
most
absurd
exaltation
she
broke
off
wondering
why
she
had
spoken
westall
reopened
a
magazine
which
he
had
laid
aside
at
the
beginning
of
their
discussion
what
you
tell
me
is
immensely
flattering
to
my
oratorical
talent
but
i
fear
you
overrate
its
effect
i
can
assure
you
that
miss
van
sideren
does
have
to
have
her
thinking
done
for
her
she
quite
capable
of
doing
it
herself
you
seem
very
familiar
with
her
mental
processes
flashed
unguardedly
from
his
wife
he
looked
up
quietly
from
the
pages
he
was
cutting
i
should
like
to
be
he
answered
she
interests
me
ii
if
there
be
a
distinction
in
being
misunderstood
it
was
one
denied
to
julia
westall
when
she
left
her
first
husband
every
one
was
ready
to
excuse
and
even
to
defend
her
the
world
she
adorned
agreed
that
john
arment
was
impossible
and
hostesses
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
at
the
thought
that
it
would
no
longer
be
necessary
to
ask
him
to
dine
there
had
been
no
scandal
connected
with
the
divorce
neither
side
had
accused
the
other
of
the
offence
euphemistically
described
as
statutory
the
arments
had
indeed
been
obliged
to
transfer
their
allegiance
to
a
state
which
recognized
desertion
as
a
cause
for
divorce
and
construed
the
term
so
liberally
that
the
seeds
of
desertion
were
shown
to
exist
in
every
union
even
arment
second
marriage
did
not
make
traditional
morality
stir
in
its
sleep
it
was
known
that
she
had
not
met
her
second
husband
till
after
she
had
parted
from
the
first
and
she
had
moreover
replaced
a
rich
man
by
a
poor
one
though
clement
westall
was
acknowledged
to
be
a
rising
lawyer
it
was
generally
felt
that
his
fortunes
would
not
rise
as
rapidly
as
his
reputation
the
westalls
would
probably
always
have
to
live
quietly
and
go
out
to
dinner
in
cabs
could
there
be
better
evidence
of
arment
complete
disinterestedness
if
the
reasoning
by
which
her
friends
justified
her
course
was
somewhat
cruder
and
less
complex
than
her
own
elucidation
of
the
matter
both
explanations
led
to
the
same
conclusion
john
arment
was
impossible
the
only
difference
was
that
to
his
wife
his
impossibility
was
something
deeper
than
a
social
disqualification
she
had
once
said
in
ironical
defence
of
her
marriage
that
it
had
at
least
preserved
her
from
the
necessity
of
sitting
next
to
him
at
dinner
but
she
had
not
then
realized
at
what
cost
the
immunity
was
purchased
john
arment
was
impossible
but
the
sting
of
his
impossibility
lay
in
the
fact
that
he
made
it
impossible
for
those
about
him
to
be
other
than
himself
by
an
unconscious
process
of
elimination
he
had
excluded
from
the
world
everything
of
which
he
did
not
feel
a
personal
need
had
become
as
it
were
a
climate
in
which
only
his
own
requirements
survived
this
might
seem
to
imply
a
deliberate
selfishness
but
there
was
nothing
deliberate
about
arment
he
was
as
instinctive
as
an
animal
or
a
child
it
was
this
childish
element
in
his
nature
which
sometimes
for
a
moment
unsettled
his
wife
estimate
of
him
was
it
possible
that
he
was
simply
undeveloped
that
he
had
delayed
somewhat
longer
than
is
usual
the
laborious
process
of
growing
up
he
had
the
kind
of
sporadic
shrewdness
which
causes
it
to
be
said
of
a
dull
man
that
he
is
no
fool
and
it
was
this
quality
that
his
wife
found
most
trying
even
to
the
naturalist
it
is
annoying
to
have
his
deductions
disturbed
by
some
unforeseen
aberrancy
of
form
or
function
and
how
much
more
so
to
the
wife
whose
estimate
of
herself
is
inevitably
bound
up
with
her
judgment
of
her
husband
arment
shrewdness
did
not
indeed
imply
any
latent
intellectual
power
it
suggested
rather
potentialities
of
feeling
of
suffering
perhaps
in
a
blind
rudimentary
way
on
which
julia
sensibilities
naturally
declined
to
linger
she
so
fully
understood
her
own
reasons
for
leaving
him
that
she
disliked
to
think
they
were
not
as
comprehensible
to
her
husband
she
was
haunted
in
her
analytic
moments
by
the
look
of
perplexity
too
inarticulate
for
words
with
which
he
had
acquiesced
to
her
explanations
these
moments
were
rare
with
her
however
her
marriage
had
been
too
concrete
a
misery
to
be
surveyed
philosophically
if
she
had
been
unhappy
for
complex
reasons
the
unhappiness
was
as
real
as
though
it
had
been
uncomplicated
soul
is
more
bruisable
than
flesh
and
julia
was
wounded
in
every
fibre
of
her
spirit
her
husband
personality
seemed
to
be
closing
gradually
in
on
her
obscuring
the
sky
and
cutting
off
the
air
till
she
felt
herself
shut
up
among
the
decaying
bodies
of
her
starved
hopes
a
sense
of
having
been
decoyed
by
some
conspiracy
into
this
bondage
of
body
and
soul
filled
her
with
despair
if
marriage
was
the
slow
acquittal
of
a
debt
contracted
in
ignorance
then
marriage
was
a
crime
against
human
nature
she
for
one
would
have
no
share
in
maintaining
the
pretence
of
which
she
had
been
a
victim
the
pretence
that
a
man
and
a
woman
forced
into
the
narrowest
of
personal
relations
must
remain
there
till
the
end
though
they
may
have
outgrown
the
span
of
each
other
natures
as
the
mature
tree
outgrows
the
iron
brace
about
the
sapling
it
was
in
the
first
heat
of
her
moral
indignation
that
she
had
met
clement
westall
she
had
seen
at
once
that
he
was
interested
and
had
fought
off
the
discovery
dreading
any
influence
that
should
draw
her
back
into
the
bondage
of
conventional
relations
to
ward
off
the
peril
she
had
with
an
almost
crude
precipitancy
revealed
her
opinions
to
him
to
her
surprise
she
found
that
he
shared
them
she
was
attracted
by
the
frankness
of
a
suitor
who
while
pressing
his
suit
admitted
that
he
did
not
believe
in
marriage
her
worst
audacities
did
not
seem
to
surprise
him
he
had
thought
out
all
that
she
had
felt
and
they
had
reached
the
same
conclusion
people
grew
at
varying
rates
and
the
yoke
that
was
an
easy
fit
for
the
one
might
soon
become
galling
to
the
other
that
was
what
divorce
was
for
the
readjustment
of
personal
relations
as
soon
as
their
necessarily
transitive
nature
was
recognized
they
would
gain
in
dignity
as
well
as
in
harmony
there
would
be
no
farther
need
of
the
ignoble
concessions
and
connivances
the
perpetual
sacrifice
of
personal
delicacy
and
moral
pride
by
means
of
which
imperfect
marriages
were
now
held
together
each
partner
to
the
contract
would
be
on
his
mettle
forced
to
live
up
to
the
highest
standard
of
on
pain
of
losing
the
other
respect
and
affection
the
low
nature
could
no
longer
drag
the
higher
down
but
must
struggle
to
rise
or
remain
alone
on
its
inferior
level
the
only
necessary
condition
to
a
harmonious
marriage
was
a
frank
recognition
of
this
truth
and
a
solemn
agreement
between
the
contracting
parties
to
keep
faith
with
themselves
and
not
to
live
together
for
a
moment
after
complete
accord
had
ceased
to
exist
between
them
the
new
adultery
was
unfaithfulness
to
self
it
was
as
westall
had
just
reminded
her
on
this
understanding
that
they
had
married
the
ceremony
was
an
unimportant
concession
to
social
prejudice
now
that
the
door
of
divorce
stood
open
no
marriage
need
be
an
imprisonment
and
the
contract
therefore
no
longer
involved
any
diminution
of
the
nature
of
their
attachment
placed
them
so
far
beyond
the
reach
of
such
contingencies
that
it
was
easy
to
discuss
them
with
an
open
mind
and
julia
sense
of
security
made
her
dwell
with
a
tender
insistence
on
westall
promise
to
claim
his
release
when
he
should
cease
to
love
her
the
exchange
of
these
vows
seemed
to
make
them
in
a
sense
champions
of
the
new
law
pioneers
in
the
forbidden
realm
of
individual
freedom
they
felt
that
they
had
somehow
achieved
beatitude
without
martyrdom
this
as
julia
now
reviewed
the
past
she
perceived
to
have
been
her
theoretical
attitude
toward
marriage
it
was
unconsciously
insidiously
that
her
ten
years
of
happiness
with
westall
had
developed
another
conception
of
the
tie
a
reversion
rather
to
the
old
instinct
of
passionate
dependency
and
possessorship
that
now
made
her
blood
revolt
at
the
mere
hint
of
change
change
renewal
was
that
what
they
had
called
it
in
their
foolish
jargon
destruction
extermination
rather
this
rending
of
a
myriad
fibres
interwoven
with
being
another
but
he
was
not
other
he
and
she
were
one
one
in
the
mystic
sense
which
alone
gave
marriage
its
significance
the
new
law
was
not
for
them
but
for
the
disunited
creatures
forced
into
a
mockery
of
union
the
gospel
she
had
felt
called
on
to
proclaim
had
no
bearing
on
her
own
case
she
sent
for
the
doctor
and
told
him
she
was
sure
she
needed
a
nerve
tonic
she
took
the
nerve
tonic
diligently
but
it
failed
to
act
as
a
sedative
to
her
fears
she
did
not
know
what
she
feared
but
that
made
her
anxiety
the
more
pervasive
her
husband
had
not
reverted
to
the
subject
of
his
saturday
talks
he
was
unusually
kind
and
considerate
with
a
softening
of
his
quick
manner
a
touch
of
shyness
in
his
consideration
that
sickened
her
with
new
fears
she
told
herself
that
it
was
because
she
looked
badly
because
he
knew
about
the
doctor
and
the
nerve
tonic
that
he
showed
this
deference
to
her
wishes
this
eagerness
to
screen
her
from
moral
draughts
but
the
explanation
simply
cleared
the
way
for
fresh
inferences
the
week
passed
slowly
vacantly
like
a
prolonged
sunday
on
saturday
the
morning
post
brought
a
note
from
van
sideren
would
dear
julia
ask
westall
to
come
half
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
as
there
was
to
be
some
music
after
his
talk
westall
was
just
leaving
for
his
office
when
his
wife
read
the
note
she
opened
the
door
and
called
him
back
to
deliver
the
message
he
glanced
at
the
note
and
tossed
it
aside
what
a
bore
i
shall
have
to
cut
my
game
of
racquets
well
i
suppose
it
ca
be
helped
will
you
write
and
say
it
all
right
julia
hesitated
a
moment
her
hand
stiffening
on
the
against
which
she
leaned
you
mean
to
go
on
with
these
talks
she
asked
i
why
not
he
returned
and
this
time
it
struck
her
that
his
surprise
was
not
quite
unfeigned
the
discovery
helped
her
to
find
words
you
said
you
had
started
them
with
the
idea
of
pleasing
me
well
i
told
you
last
week
that
they
did
please
me
last
week
oh
he
seemed
to
make
an
effort
of
memory
i
thought
you
were
nervous
then
you
sent
for
the
doctor
the
next
day
it
was
not
the
doctor
i
needed
it
was
your
assurance
my
assurance
suddenly
she
felt
the
floor
fail
under
her
she
sank
into
the
chair
with
a
choking
throat
her
words
her
reasons
slipping
away
from
her
like
straws
down
a
whirling
flood
clement
she
cried
is
it
enough
for
you
to
know
that
i
hate
it
he
turned
to
close
the
door
behind
them
then
he
walked
toward
her
and
sat
down
what
is
it
that
you
hate
he
asked
gently
she
had
made
a
desperate
effort
to
rally
her
routed
argument
i
ca
bear
to
have
you
speak
as
if
as
if
our
marriage
were
like
the
other
kind
the
wrong
kind
when
i
heard
you
there
the
other
afternoon
before
all
those
inquisitive
gossiping
people
proclaiming
that
husbands
and
wives
had
a
right
to
leave
each
other
whenever
they
were
tired
or
had
seen
some
one
else
westall
sat
motionless
his
eyes
fixed
on
a
pattern
of
the
carpet
you
ceased
to
take
this
view
then
he
said
as
she
broke
off
you
no
longer
believe
that
husbands
and
wives
justified
in
separating
under
such
conditions
under
such
conditions
she
stammered
yes
i
still
believe
that
but
how
can
we
judge
for
others
what
can
we
know
of
the
circumstances
he
interrupted
her
i
thought
it
was
a
fundamental
article
of
our
creed
that
the
special
circumstances
produced
by
marriage
were
not
to
interfere
with
the
full
assertion
of
individual
liberty
he
paused
a
moment
i
thought
that
was
your
reason
for
leaving
arment
she
flushed
to
the
forehead
it
was
not
like
him
to
give
a
personal
turn
to
the
argument
it
was
my
reason
she
said
simply
well
then
why
do
you
refuse
to
recognize
its
validity
now
i
do
i
do
i
only
say
that
one
ca
judge
for
others
he
made
an
impatient
movement
this
is
mere
what
you
mean
is
that
the
doctrine
having
served
your
purpose
when
you
needed
it
you
now
repudiate
it
well
she
exclaimed
flushing
again
what
if
i
do
what
does
it
matter
to
us
westall
rose
from
his
chair
he
was
excessively
pale
and
stood
before
his
wife
with
something
of
the
formality
of
a
stranger
it
matters
to
me
he
said
in
a
low
voice
because
i
do
repudiate
it
well
and
because
i
had
intended
to
invoke
it
as
he
paused
and
drew
his
breath
deeply
she
sat
silent
almost
deafened
by
her
as
a
complete
justification
of
the
course
i
am
about
to
take
julia
remained
motionless
what
course
is
that
she
asked
he
cleared
his
throat
i
mean
to
claim
the
fulfilment
of
your
promise
for
an
instant
the
room
wavered
and
darkened
then
she
recovered
a
torturing
acuteness
of
vision
every
detail
of
her
surroundings
pressed
upon
her
the
tick
of
the
clock
the
slant
of
sunlight
on
the
wall
the
hardness
of
the
that
she
grasped
were
a
separate
wound
to
each
sense
my
promise
she
faltered
your
part
of
our
mutual
agreement
to
set
each
other
free
if
one
or
the
other
should
wish
to
be
released
she
was
silent
again
he
waited
a
moment
shifting
his
position
nervously
then
he
said
with
a
touch
of
irritability
you
acknowledge
the
agreement
the
question
went
through
her
like
a
shock
she
lifted
her
head
to
it
proudly
i
acknowledge
the
agreement
she
said
and
you
do
mean
to
repudiate
it
a
log
on
the
hearth
fell
forward
and
mechanically
he
advanced
and
pushed
it
back
no
she
answered
slowly
i
do
mean
to
repudiate
it
there
was
a
pause
he
remained
near
the
hearth
his
elbow
resting
on
the
close
to
his
hand
stood
a
little
cup
of
jade
that
he
had
given
her
on
one
of
their
wedding
anniversaries
she
wondered
vaguely
if
he
noticed
it
you
intend
to
leave
me
then
she
said
at
length
his
gesture
seemed
to
deprecate
the
crudeness
of
the
allusion
to
marry
some
one
else
again
his
eye
and
hand
protested
she
rose
and
stood
before
him
why
should
you
be
afraid
to
tell
me
is
it
una
van
sideren
he
was
silent
i
wish
you
good
luck
she
said
iii
she
looked
up
finding
herself
alone
she
did
not
remember
when
or
how
he
had
left
the
room
or
how
long
afterward
she
had
sat
there
the
fire
still
smouldered
on
the
hearth
but
the
slant
of
sunlight
had
left
the
wall
her
first
conscious
thought
was
that
she
had
not
broken
her
word
that
she
had
fulfilled
the
very
letter
of
their
bargain
there
had
been
no
crying
out
no
vain
appeal
to
the
past
no
attempt
at
temporizing
or
evasion
she
had
marched
straight
up
to
the
guns
now
that
it
was
over
she
sickened
to
find
herself
alive
she
looked
about
her
trying
to
recover
her
hold
on
reality
her
identity
seemed
to
be
slipping
from
her
as
it
disappears
in
a
physical
swoon
this
is
my
room
this
is
my
house
she
heard
herself
saying
her
room
her
house
she
could
almost
hear
the
walls
laugh
back
at
her
she
stood
up
a
dull
ache
in
every
bone
the
silence
of
the
room
frightened
her
she
remembered
now
having
heard
the
front
door
close
a
long
time
ago
the
sound
suddenly
through
her
brain
her
husband
must
have
left
the
house
then
her
she
no
longer
knew
in
what
terms
to
think
the
simplest
phrases
had
a
poisoned
edge
she
sank
back
into
her
chair
overcome
by
a
strange
weakness
the
clock
struck
ten
it
was
only
ten
suddenly
she
remembered
that
she
had
not
ordered
dinner
or
were
they
dining
out
that
evening
dining
the
old
meaningless
phraseology
pursued
her
she
must
try
to
think
of
herself
as
she
would
think
of
some
one
else
a
some
one
dissociated
from
all
the
familiar
routine
of
the
past
whose
wants
and
habits
must
gradually
be
learned
as
one
might
spy
out
the
ways
of
a
strange
animal
the
clock
struck
another
hour
eleven
she
stood
up
again
and
walked
to
the
door
she
thought
she
would
go
up
stairs
to
her
room
room
again
the
word
derided
her
she
opened
the
door
crossed
the
narrow
hall
and
walked
up
the
stairs
as
she
passed
she
noticed
sticks
and
umbrellas
a
pair
of
his
gloves
lay
on
the
hall
table
the
same
mounted
between
the
same
walls
the
same
old
french
print
in
its
narrow
black
frame
faced
her
on
the
landing
this
visual
continuity
was
intolerable
within
a
gaping
chasm
without
the
same
untroubled
and
familiar
surface
she
must
get
away
from
it
before
she
could
attempt
to
think
but
once
in
her
room
she
sat
down
on
the
lounge
a
stupor
creeping
over
her
gradually
her
vision
cleared
a
great
deal
had
happened
in
the
interval
a
wild
marching
and
countermarching
of
emotions
arguments
ideas
a
fury
of
insurgent
impulses
that
fell
back
spent
upon
themselves
she
had
tried
at
first
to
rally
to
organize
these
chaotic
forces
there
must
be
help
somewhere
if
only
she
could
master
the
inner
tumult
life
could
not
be
broken
off
short
like
this
for
a
whim
a
fancy
the
law
itself
would
side
with
her
would
defend
her
the
law
what
claim
had
she
upon
it
she
was
the
prisoner
of
her
own
choice
she
had
been
her
own
legislator
and
she
was
the
predestined
victim
of
the
code
she
had
devised
but
this
was
grotesque
intolerable
a
mad
mistake
for
which
she
could
not
be
held
accountable
the
law
she
had
despised
was
still
there
might
still
be
invoked
invoked
but
to
what
end
could
she
ask
it
to
chain
westall
to
her
side
had
been
allowed
to
go
free
when
she
claimed
her
freedom
should
she
show
less
magnanimity
than
she
had
exacted
magnanimity
the
word
lashed
her
with
its
irony
one
does
not
strike
an
attitude
when
one
is
fighting
for
life
she
would
threaten
grovel
cajole
she
would
yield
anything
to
keep
her
hold
on
happiness
ah
but
the
difficulty
lay
deeper
the
law
could
not
help
her
her
own
apostasy
could
not
help
her
she
was
the
victim
of
the
theories
she
renounced
it
was
as
though
some
giant
machine
of
her
own
making
had
caught
her
up
in
its
wheels
and
was
grinding
her
to
atoms
it
was
afternoon
when
she
found
herself
she
walked
with
an
aimless
haste
fearing
to
meet
familiar
faces
the
day
was
radiant
metallic
one
of
those
searching
american
days
so
calculated
to
reveal
the
shortcomings
of
our
and
the
excesses
of
our
architecture
the
streets
looked
bare
and
hideous
everything
stared
and
glittered
she
called
a
passing
hansom
and
gave
van
address
she
did
not
know
what
had
led
up
to
the
act
but
she
found
herself
suddenly
resolved
to
speak
to
cry
out
a
warning
it
was
too
late
to
save
herself
but
the
girl
might
still
be
told
the
hansom
rattled
up
fifth
avenue
she
sat
with
her
eyes
fixed
avoiding
recognition
at
the
van
siderens
door
she
sprang
out
and
rang
the
bell
action
had
cleared
her
brain
and
she
felt
calm
and
she
knew
now
exactly
what
she
meant
to
say
the
ladies
were
both
out
the
stood
waiting
for
a
card
julia
with
a
vague
murmur
turned
away
from
the
door
and
lingered
a
moment
on
the
sidewalk
then
she
remembered
that
she
had
not
paid
the
she
drew
a
dollar
from
her
purse
and
handed
it
to
him
he
touched
his
hat
and
drove
off
leaving
her
alone
in
the
long
empty
street
she
wandered
away
westward
toward
strange
thoroughfares
where
she
was
not
likely
to
meet
acquaintances
the
feeling
of
aimlessness
had
returned
once
she
found
herself
in
the
afternoon
torrent
of
broadway
swept
past
tawdry
shops
and
flaming
theatrical
posters
with
a
succession
of
meaningless
faces
gliding
by
in
the
opposite
direction
a
feeling
of
faintness
reminded
her
that
she
had
not
eaten
since
morning
she
turned
into
a
side
street
of
shabby
houses
with
rows
of
behind
bent
area
railings
in
a
basement
window
she
saw
the
sign
restaurant
a
pie
and
a
dish
of
doughnuts
lay
against
the
dusty
pane
like
petrified
food
in
an
ethnological
museum
she
entered
and
a
young
woman
with
a
weak
mouth
and
a
brazen
eye
cleared
a
table
for
her
near
the
window
the
table
was
covered
with
a
red
and
white
cotton
cloth
and
adorned
with
a
bunch
of
celery
in
a
thick
tumbler
and
a
full
of
grayish
lumpy
salt
julia
ordered
tea
and
sat
a
long
time
waiting
for
it
she
was
glad
to
be
away
from
the
noise
and
confusion
of
the
streets
the
room
was
empty
and
two
or
three
waitresses
with
thin
pert
faces
lounged
in
the
background
staring
at
her
and
whispering
together
at
last
the
tea
was
brought
in
a
discolored
metal
teapot
julia
poured
a
cup
and
drank
it
hastily
it
was
black
and
bitter
but
it
flowed
through
her
veins
like
an
elixir
she
was
almost
dizzy
with
exhilaration
oh
how
tired
how
unutterably
tired
she
had
been
she
drank
a
second
cup
blacker
and
bitterer
and
now
her
mind
was
once
more
working
clearly
she
felt
as
vigorous
as
decisive
as
when
she
had
stood
on
the
van
siderens
but
the
wish
to
return
there
had
subsided
she
saw
now
the
futility
of
such
an
attempt
the
humiliation
to
which
it
might
have
exposed
her
the
pity
of
it
was
that
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
next
the
short
winter
day
was
fading
and
she
realized
that
she
could
not
remain
much
longer
in
the
restaurant
without
attracting
notice
she
paid
for
her
tea
and
went
out
into
the
street
the
lamps
were
alight
and
here
and
there
a
basement
shop
cast
an
oblong
of
across
the
fissured
pavement
in
the
dusk
there
was
something
sinister
about
the
aspect
of
the
street
and
she
hastened
back
toward
fifth
avenue
she
was
not
used
to
being
out
alone
at
that
hour
at
the
corner
of
fifth
avenue
she
paused
and
stood
watching
the
stream
of
carriages
at
last
a
policeman
caught
sight
of
her
and
signed
to
her
that
he
would
take
her
across
she
had
not
meant
to
cross
the
street
but
she
obeyed
automatically
and
presently
found
herself
on
the
farther
corner
there
she
paused
again
for
a
moment
but
she
fancied
the
policeman
was
watching
her
and
this
sent
her
hastening
down
the
nearest
side
street
after
that
she
walked
a
long
time
vaguely
night
had
fallen
and
now
and
then
through
the
windows
of
a
passing
carriage
she
caught
the
expanse
of
an
evening
waistcoat
or
the
shimmer
of
an
opera
cloak
suddenly
she
found
herself
in
a
familiar
street
she
stood
still
a
moment
breathing
quickly
she
had
turned
the
corner
without
noticing
whither
it
led
but
now
a
few
yards
ahead
of
her
she
saw
the
house
in
which
she
had
once
lived
her
first
husband
house
the
blinds
were
drawn
and
only
a
faint
translucence
marked
the
windows
and
the
transom
above
the
door
as
she
stood
there
she
heard
a
step
behind
her
and
a
man
walked
by
in
the
direction
of
the
house
he
walked
slowly
with
a
heavy
gait
his
head
sunk
a
little
between
the
shoulders
the
red
crease
of
his
neck
visible
above
the
fur
collar
of
his
overcoat
he
crossed
the
street
went
up
the
steps
of
the
house
drew
forth
a
and
let
himself
in
there
was
no
one
else
in
sight
julia
leaned
for
a
long
time
against
the
at
the
corner
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
front
of
the
house
the
feeling
of
physical
weariness
had
returned
but
the
strong
tea
still
throbbed
in
her
veins
and
lit
her
brain
with
an
unnatural
clearness
presently
she
heard
another
step
draw
near
and
moving
quickly
away
she
too
crossed
the
street
and
mounted
the
steps
of
the
house
the
impulse
which
had
carried
her
there
prolonged
itself
in
a
quick
pressure
of
the
electric
bell
then
she
felt
suddenly
weak
and
tremulous
and
grasped
the
balustrade
for
support
the
door
opened
and
a
young
footman
with
a
fresh
inexperienced
face
stood
on
the
threshold
julia
knew
in
an
instant
that
he
would
admit
her
i
saw
arment
going
in
just
now
she
said
will
you
ask
him
to
see
me
for
a
moment
the
footman
hesitated
i
think
arment
has
gone
up
to
dress
for
dinner
madam
julia
advanced
into
the
hall
i
am
sure
he
will
see
me
i
will
not
detain
him
long
she
said
she
spoke
quietly
authoritatively
in
the
tone
which
a
good
servant
does
not
mistake
the
footman
had
his
hand
on
the
door
i
will
tell
him
madam
what
name
please
julia
trembled
she
had
not
thought
of
that
merely
say
a
lady
she
returned
carelessly
the
footman
wavered
and
she
fancied
herself
lost
but
at
that
instant
the
door
opened
from
within
and
john
arment
stepped
into
the
hall
he
drew
back
sharply
as
he
saw
her
his
florid
face
turning
sallow
with
the
shock
then
the
blood
poured
back
to
it
swelling
the
veins
on
his
temples
and
reddening
the
lobes
of
his
thick
ears
it
was
long
since
julia
had
seen
him
and
she
was
startled
at
the
change
in
his
appearance
he
had
thickened
coarsened
settled
down
into
the
enclosing
flesh
but
she
noted
this
insensibly
her
one
conscious
thought
was
that
now
she
was
face
to
face
with
him
she
must
not
let
him
escape
till
he
had
heard
her
every
pulse
in
her
body
throbbed
with
the
urgency
of
her
message
she
went
up
to
him
as
he
drew
back
i
must
speak
to
you
she
said
arment
hesitated
red
and
stammering
julia
glanced
at
the
footman
and
her
look
acted
as
a
warning
the
instinctive
shrinking
from
a
scene
predominated
over
every
other
impulse
and
arment
said
slowly
will
you
come
this
way
he
followed
her
into
the
and
closed
the
door
julia
as
she
advanced
was
vaguely
aware
that
the
room
at
least
was
unchanged
time
had
not
mitigated
its
horrors
the
contadina
still
lurched
from
the
and
the
greek
slave
obstructed
the
threshold
of
the
inner
room
the
place
was
alive
with
memories
they
started
out
from
every
fold
of
the
yellow
satin
curtains
and
glided
between
the
angles
of
the
rosewood
furniture
but
while
some
subordinate
agency
was
carrying
these
impressions
to
her
brain
her
whole
conscious
effort
was
centred
in
the
act
of
dominating
arment
will
the
fear
that
he
would
refuse
to
hear
her
mounted
like
fever
to
her
brain
she
felt
her
purpose
melt
before
it
words
and
arguments
running
into
each
other
in
the
heat
of
her
longing
for
a
moment
her
voice
failed
her
and
she
imagined
herself
thrust
out
before
she
could
speak
but
as
she
was
struggling
for
a
word
arment
pushed
a
chair
forward
and
said
quietly
you
are
not
well
the
sound
of
his
voice
steadied
her
it
was
neither
kind
nor
unkind
a
voice
that
suspended
judgment
rather
awaiting
unforeseen
developments
she
supported
herself
against
the
back
of
the
chair
and
drew
a
deep
breath
shall
i
send
for
something
he
continued
with
a
cold
embarrassed
politeness
julia
raised
an
entreating
hand
no
no
thank
you
i
am
quite
well
he
paused
midway
toward
the
bell
and
turned
on
her
then
may
i
ask
yes
she
interrupted
him
i
came
here
because
i
wanted
to
see
you
there
is
something
i
must
tell
you
arment
continued
to
scrutinize
her
i
am
surprised
at
that
he
said
i
should
have
supposed
that
any
communication
you
may
wish
to
make
could
have
been
made
through
our
lawyers
our
lawyers
she
burst
into
a
little
laugh
i
do
think
they
could
help
me
this
time
arment
face
took
on
a
barricaded
look
if
there
is
any
question
of
help
of
course
it
struck
her
whimsically
that
she
had
seen
that
look
when
some
shabby
devil
called
with
a
perhaps
he
thought
she
wanted
him
to
put
his
name
down
for
so
much
in
sympathy
or
even
in
money
the
thought
made
her
laugh
again
she
saw
his
look
change
slowly
to
perplexity
all
his
facial
changes
were
slow
and
she
remembered
suddenly
how
it
had
once
diverted
her
to
shift
that
lumbering
scenery
with
a
word
for
the
first
time
it
struck
her
that
she
had
been
cruel
there
a
question
of
help
she
said
in
a
softer
key
you
can
help
me
but
only
by
listening
i
want
to
tell
you
something
arment
resistance
was
not
yielding
would
it
not
be
easier
to
write
he
suggested
she
shook
her
head
there
is
no
time
to
write
and
it
wo
take
long
she
raised
her
head
and
their
eyes
met
my
husband
has
left
me
she
said
westall
he
stammered
reddening
again
yes
this
morning
just
as
i
left
you
because
he
was
tired
of
me
the
words
uttered
scarcely
above
a
whisper
seemed
to
dilate
to
the
limit
of
the
room
arment
looked
toward
the
door
then
his
embarrassed
glance
returned
to
julia
i
am
very
sorry
he
said
awkwardly
thank
you
she
murmured
but
i
do
see
no
but
you
will
in
a
moment
wo
you
listen
to
me
please
instinctively
she
had
shifted
her
position
putting
herself
between
him
and
the
door
it
happened
this
morning
she
went
on
in
short
breathless
phrases
i
never
suspected
anything
i
thought
we
were
perfectly
happy
suddenly
he
told
me
he
was
tired
of
me
there
is
a
girl
he
likes
better
he
has
gone
to
her
as
she
spoke
the
lurking
anguish
rose
upon
her
possessing
her
once
more
to
the
exclusion
of
every
other
emotion
her
eyes
ached
her
throat
swelled
with
it
and
two
painful
tears
burnt
a
way
down
her
face
arment
constraint
was
increasing
visibly
this
this
is
very
unfortunate
he
began
but
i
should
say
the
law
the
law
she
echoed
ironically
when
he
asks
for
his
freedom
you
are
not
obliged
to
give
it
you
were
not
obliged
to
give
me
mine
but
you
did
he
made
a
protesting
gesture
you
saw
that
the
law
could
help
you
did
you
she
went
on
that
is
what
i
see
now
the
law
represents
material
rights
it
go
beyond
if
we
do
recognize
an
inner
law
the
obligation
that
love
creates
being
loved
as
well
as
loving
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
our
spreading
ruin
unhindered
is
there
she
raised
her
head
plaintively
with
the
look
of
a
bewildered
child
that
is
what
i
see
now
what
i
wanted
to
tell
you
he
leaves
me
because
he
tired
but
was
not
tired
and
i
do
understand
why
he
is
that
the
dreadful
part
of
it
the
not
understanding
i
had
realized
what
it
meant
but
i
been
thinking
of
it
all
day
and
things
have
come
back
to
me
things
i
had
noticed
when
you
and
i
she
moved
closer
to
him
and
fixed
her
eyes
on
his
with
the
gaze
that
tries
to
reach
beyond
words
i
see
now
that
did
understand
did
you
their
eyes
met
in
a
sudden
shock
of
comprehension
a
veil
seemed
to
be
lifted
between
them
arment
lip
trembled
no
he
said
i
did
understand
she
gave
a
little
cry
almost
of
triumph
i
knew
it
i
knew
it
you
wondered
you
tried
to
tell
me
but
no
words
came
you
saw
your
life
falling
in
ruins
the
world
slipping
from
you
and
you
could
speak
or
move
she
sank
down
on
the
chair
against
which
she
had
been
leaning
now
i
know
now
i
know
she
repeated
i
am
very
sorry
for
you
she
heard
arment
stammer
she
looked
up
quickly
that
not
what
i
came
for
i
do
want
you
to
be
sorry
i
came
to
ask
you
to
forgive
me
for
not
understanding
that
did
understand
that
all
i
wanted
to
say
she
rose
with
a
vague
sense
that
the
end
had
come
and
put
out
a
groping
hand
toward
the
door
arment
stood
motionless
she
turned
to
him
with
a
faint
smile
you
forgive
me
there
is
nothing
to
forgive
then
will
you
shake
hands
for
she
felt
his
hand
in
hers
it
was
nerveless
reluctant
she
repeated
i
understand
now
she
opened
the
door
and
passed
out
into
the
hall
as
she
did
so
arment
took
an
impulsive
step
forward
but
just
then
the
footman
who
was
evidently
alive
to
his
obligations
advanced
from
the
background
to
let
her
out
she
heard
arment
fall
back
the
footman
threw
open
the
door
and
she
found
herself
outside
in
the
darkness
the
letter
i
for
many
years
he
had
lived
withdrawn
from
the
world
in
which
he
had
once
played
so
active
and
even
turbulent
a
part
the
study
of
tuscan
art
was
his
only
pursuit
and
it
was
to
help
him
in
the
classification
of
his
notes
and
documents
that
i
was
first
called
to
his
villa
colonel
alingdon
had
then
the
look
of
a
very
old
man
though
his
age
can
hardly
have
exceeded
seventy
he
was
small
and
bent
with
a
finely
wrinkled
face
which
still
wore
the
tan
of
youthful
exposure
but
for
this
dusky
redness
it
would
have
been
hard
to
reconstruct
from
the
shrunken
recluse
with
his
low
fastidious
voice
and
carefully
tended
hands
an
image
of
that
young
knight
of
adventure
whose
sword
had
been
at
the
service
of
every
uprising
which
stirred
the
uneasy
soil
of
italy
in
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
though
i
was
more
of
a
proficient
in
colonel
alingdon
later
than
his
earlier
pursuits
the
thought
of
his
soldiering
days
was
always
coming
between
me
and
the
pacific
work
of
his
old
age
as
we
sat
collating
papers
and
comparing
photographs
i
had
the
feeling
that
this
dry
and
quiet
old
man
had
seen
even
stranger
things
than
people
said
that
he
knew
more
of
the
inner
history
of
europe
than
half
the
diplomatists
of
his
day
i
was
not
alone
in
this
conviction
and
the
friend
who
had
engaged
me
for
colonel
alingdon
had
appended
to
his
instructions
the
injunction
to
get
him
to
talk
but
this
was
what
no
one
could
do
colonel
alingdon
was
ready
to
discuss
by
the
hour
the
date
of
a
giottesque
triptych
or
the
attribution
of
a
disputed
master
but
on
the
history
of
his
early
life
he
was
habitually
silent
it
was
perhaps
because
i
recognized
this
silence
and
respected
it
that
it
afterward
came
to
be
broken
for
me
or
it
was
perhaps
merely
because
as
the
failure
of
colonel
alingdon
sight
cut
him
off
from
his
work
he
felt
the
natural
inclination
of
age
to
revert
from
the
empty
present
to
the
crowded
past
for
one
cause
or
another
he
talk
to
me
in
the
last
year
of
his
life
and
i
felt
myself
mingled
to
an
extent
inconceivable
to
the
mere
reader
of
history
with
the
passionate
scenes
of
the
italian
struggle
for
liberty
colonel
alingdon
had
been
mixed
with
it
in
all
its
phases
he
had
known
the
last
carbonari
and
the
young
italy
of
mazzini
he
had
been
in
perugia
when
the
mercenaries
of
a
liberal
pope
slaughtered
women
and
children
in
the
streets
he
had
been
in
sicily
with
the
thousand
and
in
milan
during
the
they
say
the
italians
did
know
how
to
fight
he
said
one
day
musingly
that
the
french
had
to
come
down
and
do
their
work
for
them
people
forget
how
long
it
was
since
they
had
had
any
fighting
to
do
but
they
had
forgotten
how
to
suffer
and
hold
their
tongues
how
to
die
and
take
their
secrets
with
them
the
italian
war
of
independence
was
really
carried
on
underground
it
was
one
of
those
awful
silent
struggles
which
are
so
much
more
terrible
than
the
roar
of
a
battle
it
a
deuced
sight
easier
to
charge
with
your
regiment
than
to
lie
rotting
in
an
austrian
prison
and
know
that
if
you
give
up
the
name
of
a
friend
or
two
you
can
go
back
to
your
wife
and
children
and
thousands
and
thousands
of
italians
had
the
choice
given
them
and
hardly
one
went
back
he
sat
silent
his
meditative
fingertips
laid
together
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
past
which
was
the
now
only
thing
clearly
visible
to
them
and
the
women
i
said
were
they
as
brave
as
the
men
i
had
not
spoken
quite
at
random
i
had
always
heard
that
there
had
been
as
much
of
love
as
of
war
in
colonel
alingdon
early
career
and
i
hoped
that
my
question
might
give
a
personal
turn
to
his
reminiscences
the
women
he
repeated
they
were
braver
for
they
had
more
to
bear
and
less
to
do
italy
could
never
have
been
saved
without
them
his
eye
had
kindled
and
i
detected
in
it
the
reflection
of
some
vivid
memory
it
was
then
that
i
asked
him
what
was
the
bravest
thing
he
had
ever
known
of
a
woman
doing
the
question
was
such
a
vague
one
that
i
hardly
knew
why
i
had
put
it
but
to
my
surprise
he
answered
almost
at
once
as
though
i
had
touched
on
a
subject
of
frequent
meditation
the
bravest
thing
i
ever
saw
done
by
a
woman
he
said
was
brought
about
by
an
act
of
my
own
and
one
of
which
i
am
not
particularly
proud
for
that
reason
i
have
never
spoken
of
it
before
there
was
a
time
when
i
did
even
care
to
think
of
it
but
all
that
is
past
now
she
died
years
ago
and
so
did
the
jack
alingdon
she
knew
and
in
telling
you
the
story
i
am
no
more
than
the
mouthpiece
of
an
old
tradition
which
some
ancestor
might
have
handed
down
to
me
he
leaned
back
his
clear
blind
gaze
fixed
smilingly
on
me
and
i
had
the
feeling
that
in
groping
through
the
labyrinth
of
his
young
adventures
i
had
come
unawares
upon
their
central
point
ii
when
i
was
in
milan
in
an
unlucky
thing
happened
to
me
i
had
been
sent
there
to
look
over
the
ground
by
some
of
my
italian
friends
in
england
as
an
english
officer
i
had
no
difficulty
in
getting
into
milanese
society
for
england
had
for
years
been
the
refuge
of
the
italian
fugitives
and
i
was
known
to
be
working
in
their
interests
it
was
just
the
kind
of
job
i
liked
and
i
never
enjoyed
life
more
than
i
did
in
those
days
there
was
a
great
deal
going
on
good
music
balls
and
theatres
milan
kept
up
her
gayety
to
the
last
the
english
were
shocked
by
the
of
a
race
who
could
dance
under
the
very
nose
of
the
usurper
but
those
who
understood
the
situation
knew
that
milan
was
playing
brutus
and
playing
it
uncommonly
well
i
was
in
the
thick
of
it
all
it
was
just
the
atmosphere
to
suit
a
young
fellow
of
with
a
healthy
passion
for
waltzing
and
fighting
but
as
i
said
an
unlucky
thing
happened
to
me
i
was
fool
enough
to
fall
in
love
with
donna
candida
falco
you
have
heard
of
her
of
course
you
know
the
share
she
had
in
the
great
work
in
a
different
way
she
was
what
the
terrible
princess
belgioioso
had
been
to
an
earlier
generation
but
donna
candida
was
not
terrible
she
was
quiet
discreet
and
charming
when
i
knew
her
she
was
a
widow
of
thirty
her
husband
andrea
falco
having
died
ten
years
previously
soon
after
their
marriage
the
marriage
had
been
notoriously
unhappy
and
his
death
was
a
release
to
donna
candida
her
family
were
of
modena
but
they
had
come
to
live
in
milan
soon
after
the
execution
of
ciro
menotti
and
his
companions
you
remember
the
details
of
that
business
the
duke
of
modena
one
of
the
most
adroit
villains
in
europe
had
been
bitten
with
the
hope
of
uniting
the
italian
states
under
his
rule
it
was
a
vision
of
italian
liberation
of
a
sort
a
few
madmen
were
dazzled
by
it
and
ciro
menotti
was
one
of
them
you
know
the
end
the
duke
of
modena
who
had
counted
on
louis
backing
found
that
that
astute
sovereign
had
betrayed
him
to
austria
instantly
he
saw
that
his
first
business
was
to
get
rid
of
the
conspirators
he
had
created
there
was
nothing
easier
than
for
a
hapsburg
este
to
turn
on
a
friend
ciro
menotti
had
staked
his
life
for
the
duke
and
the
duke
took
it
you
may
remember
that
on
the
night
when
seven
hundred
men
and
a
cannon
attacked
menotti
house
the
duke
was
seen
looking
on
at
the
slaughter
from
an
arcade
across
the
square
well
among
the
lesser
fry
taken
that
night
was
a
lad
of
eighteen
emilio
verna
who
was
the
only
brother
of
donna
candida
the
verna
family
was
one
of
the
most
respected
in
modena
it
consisted
at
that
time
of
the
mother
countess
verna
of
young
emilio
and
his
sister
count
verna
had
been
in
spielberg
in
the
twenties
he
had
never
recovered
from
his
sufferings
there
and
died
in
exile
without
seeing
his
wife
and
children
again
countess
verna
had
been
an
ardent
patriot
in
her
youth
but
the
failure
of
the
first
attempts
against
austria
had
discouraged
her
she
thought
that
in
losing
her
husband
she
had
sacrificed
enough
for
her
country
and
her
one
idea
was
to
keep
emilio
on
good
terms
with
the
government
but
the
verna
blood
was
not
tractable
and
his
father
death
was
not
likely
to
make
emilio
a
good
subject
of
the
estes
not
that
he
had
as
yet
taken
any
active
share
in
the
work
of
the
conspirators
he
simply
had
had
time
at
his
trial
there
was
nothing
to
show
that
he
had
been
in
menotti
confidence
but
he
had
been
seen
once
or
twice
coming
out
of
what
the
ducal
police
called
suspicious
houses
and
in
his
desk
were
found
some
verses
to
italy
that
was
enough
to
hang
a
man
in
modena
and
emilio
verna
was
hanged
the
countess
never
recovered
from
the
blow
the
circumstances
of
her
son
death
were
too
abominable
to
unendurable
if
he
had
risked
his
life
in
the
conspiracy
she
might
have
been
reconciled
to
his
losing
it
but
he
was
a
mere
child
who
had
sat
at
home
chafing
but
powerless
while
his
seniors
plotted
and
fought
he
had
been
sacrificed
to
the
duke
insane
fear
to
his
savage
greed
for
victims
and
the
countess
verna
was
not
to
be
consoled
as
soon
as
possible
the
mother
and
daughter
left
modena
for
milan
there
they
lived
in
seclusion
till
candida
marriage
during
her
girlhood
she
had
had
to
accept
her
mother
view
of
life
to
shut
herself
up
in
the
tomb
in
which
the
poor
woman
brooded
over
her
martyrs
but
that
was
not
the
girl
way
of
honoring
the
dead
at
the
moment
when
the
first
shot
was
fired
on
menotti
house
she
had
been
reading
petrarch
ode
to
the
lords
of
italy
and
the
lines
valor
cor
non
e
ancor
had
lodged
like
a
bullet
in
her
brain
from
the
day
of
her
marriage
she
began
to
take
a
share
in
the
silent
work
which
was
going
on
throughout
italy
milan
was
at
that
time
the
centre
of
the
movement
and
candida
falco
threw
herself
into
it
with
all
the
passion
which
her
unhappy
marriage
left
unsatisfied
at
first
she
had
to
act
with
great
reserve
for
her
husband
was
a
prudent
man
who
did
not
care
to
have
his
habits
disturbed
by
political
complications
but
after
his
death
there
was
nothing
to
restrain
her
except
the
exquisite
tact
which
enabled
her
to
work
night
and
day
in
the
italian
cause
without
giving
the
austrian
authorities
a
pretext
for
interference
when
i
first
knew
donna
candida
her
mother
was
still
living
a
tragic
woman
prematurely
bowed
like
an
image
of
death
in
the
background
of
the
daughter
brilliant
life
the
countess
since
her
son
death
had
become
a
patriot
again
though
in
a
narrower
sense
than
candida
the
mother
first
thought
was
that
her
dead
must
be
avenged
the
daughter
that
italy
must
be
saved
but
from
different
motives
they
worked
for
the
same
end
candida
felt
for
the
countess
that
protecting
tenderness
with
which
italian
children
so
often
regard
their
parents
a
feeling
heightened
by
the
reverence
which
the
mother
sufferings
inspired
countess
verna
as
the
wife
and
mother
of
martyrs
had
done
what
candida
longed
to
do
she
had
given
her
utmost
to
italy
there
must
have
been
moments
when
the
of
her
grief
chilled
her
daughter
ardent
spirit
but
candida
revered
in
her
mother
the
image
of
their
afflicted
country
it
was
too
terrible
she
said
speaking
of
what
the
countess
had
suffered
after
emilio
death
all
the
circumstances
were
too
unmerciful
it
seemed
as
if
god
had
turned
his
face
from
my
mother
as
if
she
had
been
singled
out
to
suffer
more
than
any
of
the
others
all
the
other
families
received
some
message
or
token
of
farewell
from
the
prisoners
one
of
them
bribed
the
gaoler
to
carry
a
letter
another
sent
a
lock
of
hair
by
the
chaplain
but
emilio
made
no
sign
sent
no
word
my
mother
felt
as
though
he
had
turned
his
back
on
us
she
used
to
sit
for
hours
saying
again
and
again
was
he
the
only
one
to
forget
his
mother
i
tried
to
comfort
her
but
it
was
useless
she
had
suffered
too
much
now
i
never
reason
with
her
i
listen
and
let
her
ease
her
poor
heart
do
you
know
she
still
asks
me
sometimes
if
i
think
he
may
have
left
a
letter
if
there
is
no
way
of
finding
out
if
he
left
one
she
forgets
that
i
have
tried
again
and
again
that
i
have
sent
bribes
and
messages
to
the
gaoler
the
chaplain
to
every
one
who
came
near
him
the
answer
is
always
the
same
no
one
has
ever
heard
of
a
letter
i
suppose
the
poor
boy
was
stunned
and
did
not
think
of
writing
who
knows
what
was
passing
through
his
poor
bewildered
brain
but
it
would
have
been
a
great
help
to
my
mother
to
have
a
word
from
him
if
i
had
known
how
to
imitate
his
writing
i
should
have
forged
a
letter
i
knew
enough
of
the
italians
to
understand
how
her
boy
silence
must
have
aggravated
the
countess
grief
precious
as
a
message
from
a
dying
son
would
be
to
any
mother
such
signs
of
tenderness
have
to
the
italians
a
peculiar
significance
the
latin
race
is
rhetorical
it
possesses
the
gift
of
eloquence
the
knack
of
saying
the
effective
thing
on
momentous
occasions
the
letters
which
the
italian
patriots
sent
home
from
their
prisons
or
from
the
scaffold
are
not
the
halting
farewells
that
anguish
would
have
wrung
from
a
less
expressive
race
they
are
veritable
compositions
saved
from
affectation
only
by
the
fact
that
fluency
and
sonority
are
a
part
of
the
latin
inheritance
such
letters
passed
from
hand
to
hand
among
the
bereaved
families
were
not
only
a
comfort
to
the
survivors
but
an
incentive
to
fresh
sacrifices
they
were
the
seed
of
the
martyrs
with
which
italy
was
being
sown
and
i
knew
what
it
meant
to
the
countess
verna
to
have
no
such
treasure
in
her
bosom
to
sit
silent
while
other
mothers
quoted
their
sons
last
words
i
said
just
now
that
it
was
an
unlucky
day
for
me
when
i
fell
in
love
with
donna
candida
and
no
doubt
you
have
guessed
the
reason
she
was
in
love
with
some
one
else
it
was
the
old
situation
of
heine
song
that
other
loved
another
loved
italy
and
with
an
undivided
passion
his
name
was
fernando
briga
and
at
that
time
he
was
one
of
the
foremost
liberals
in
italy
he
came
of
a
modenese
family
his
father
was
a
doctor
a
prudent
man
engrossed
in
his
profession
and
unwilling
to
compromise
it
by
meddling
in
politics
his
irreproachable
attitude
won
the
confidence
of
the
government
and
the
duke
conferred
on
him
the
sinister
office
of
physician
to
the
prisons
of
modena
it
was
this
briga
who
attended
emilio
falco
and
several
of
the
other
prisoners
who
were
executed
at
the
same
time
under
shelter
of
his
father
loyalty
young
fernando
conspired
in
safety
he
was
studying
medicine
and
every
one
supposed
him
to
be
absorbed
in
his
work
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
fast
ripening
into
one
of
mazzini
ablest
lieutenants
his
career
belongs
to
history
so
i
need
not
enlarge
on
it
here
in
he
was
in
milan
and
had
become
one
of
the
leading
figures
in
the
liberal
group
which
was
working
for
a
coalition
with
piedmont
like
all
the
ablest
men
of
his
day
he
had
cast
off
mazziniism
and
pinned
his
faith
to
the
house
of
savoy
the
austrian
government
had
an
eye
on
him
but
he
had
inherited
his
father
prudence
though
he
used
it
for
nobler
ends
and
his
discretion
enabled
him
to
do
far
more
for
the
cause
than
a
dozen
enthusiasts
could
have
accomplished
no
one
understood
this
better
than
donna
candida
she
had
a
share
of
his
caution
and
he
trusted
her
with
secrets
which
he
would
not
have
confided
to
many
men
her
was
the
centre
of
the
piedmontese
party
yet
so
clever
was
she
in
averting
suspicion
that
more
than
one
hunted
conspirator
hid
in
her
house
and
was
helped
across
the
alps
by
her
agents
briga
relied
on
her
as
he
did
on
no
one
else
but
he
did
not
love
her
and
she
knew
it
still
she
was
young
she
was
handsome
and
he
loved
no
one
else
how
could
she
give
up
hoping
from
her
intimate
friends
she
made
no
secret
of
her
feelings
italian
women
are
not
reticent
in
such
matters
and
donna
candida
was
proud
of
loving
a
hero
you
will
see
at
once
that
i
had
no
chance
but
if
she
could
not
give
up
hope
neither
could
i
perhaps
in
her
desire
to
secure
my
services
for
the
cause
she
may
have
shown
herself
overkind
or
perhaps
i
was
still
young
enough
to
set
down
to
my
own
charms
a
success
due
to
quite
different
causes
at
any
rate
i
persuaded
myself
that
if
i
could
manage
to
do
something
conspicuous
for
italy
i
might
yet
make
her
care
for
me
with
such
an
incentive
you
will
not
wonder
that
i
worked
hard
but
though
donna
candida
was
full
of
gratitude
she
continued
to
adore
my
rival
one
day
we
had
a
hot
scene
i
began
i
believe
by
reproaching
her
with
having
led
me
on
and
when
she
defended
herself
i
retaliated
by
taunting
her
with
briga
indifference
she
grew
pale
at
that
and
said
it
was
enough
to
love
a
hero
even
without
hope
of
return
and
as
she
said
it
she
herself
looked
so
heroic
so
radiant
so
unattainably
the
woman
i
wanted
that
a
sneer
may
have
escaped
me
was
she
so
sure
then
that
briga
was
a
hero
i
remember
her
proud
silence
and
our
wretched
parting
i
went
away
feeling
that
at
last
i
had
really
lost
her
and
the
thought
made
me
savage
and
vindictive
soon
after
as
it
happened
came
the
and
milan
was
free
i
caught
a
distant
glimpse
of
donna
candida
in
the
hospital
to
which
i
was
carried
after
the
fight
but
my
wound
was
a
slight
one
and
in
hours
i
was
about
again
on
crutches
i
hoped
she
might
send
for
me
but
she
did
not
and
i
was
too
sulky
to
make
the
first
advance
a
day
or
two
later
i
heard
there
had
been
a
commotion
in
modena
and
not
being
in
fighting
trim
i
got
leave
to
go
over
there
with
one
or
two
men
whom
the
modenese
liberals
had
called
in
to
help
them
when
we
arrived
the
precious
duke
had
been
swept
out
and
a
provisional
government
set
up
one
of
my
companions
who
was
a
modenese
was
made
a
member
and
knowing
that
i
wanted
something
to
do
he
commissioned
me
to
look
up
some
papers
in
the
ducal
archives
it
was
fascinating
work
for
in
the
pursuit
of
my
documents
i
uncovered
the
hidden
springs
of
his
late
highness
paternal
administration
the
principal
papers
relative
to
the
civil
and
criminal
administration
of
modena
have
since
been
published
and
the
world
knows
how
that
estimable
sovereign
cared
for
the
material
and
spiritual
welfare
of
his
subjects
well
in
the
course
of
my
search
i
came
across
a
file
of
old
papers
marked
taken
from
political
prisoners
it
was
the
year
of
menotti
conspiracy
and
everything
connected
with
that
date
was
thrilling
i
loosened
the
band
and
ran
over
the
letters
suddenly
i
came
across
one
which
was
docketed
given
by
doctor
briga
son
to
the
warder
of
his
highness
prisons
briga
son
that
could
be
no
other
than
fernando
i
knew
he
was
an
only
child
but
how
came
such
a
paper
into
his
hands
and
how
had
it
passed
from
them
into
those
of
the
duke
warder
my
own
hands
shook
as
i
opened
the
letter
i
felt
the
man
suddenly
in
my
power
then
i
began
to
read
my
adored
mother
even
in
this
lowest
circle
of
hell
all
hearts
are
not
closed
to
pity
and
i
have
been
given
the
hope
that
these
last
words
of
farewell
may
reach
you
my
eyes
ran
on
over
pages
of
plaintive
rhetoric
embrace
for
me
my
adored
candida
let
her
never
forget
the
cause
for
which
her
father
and
brother
perished
let
her
keep
alive
in
her
breast
the
thought
of
spielberg
and
reggio
do
not
grieve
that
i
die
so
young
though
not
with
those
heroes
in
deed
i
was
with
them
in
spirit
and
am
worthy
to
be
enrolled
in
the
sacred
phalanx
and
so
on
before
i
reached
the
signature
i
knew
the
letter
was
from
emilio
verna
i
put
it
in
my
pocket
finished
my
work
and
started
immediately
for
milan
i
did
quite
know
what
i
meant
to
do
my
head
was
in
a
whirl
i
saw
at
once
what
must
have
happened
fernando
briga
then
a
lad
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
had
attended
his
father
in
prison
during
emilio
verna
last
hours
and
the
latter
perhaps
aware
of
the
lad
liberal
sympathies
had
found
an
opportunity
of
giving
him
the
letter
but
why
had
briga
given
it
up
to
the
warder
that
was
the
puzzling
question
the
docket
said
doctor
briga
son
but
it
might
mean
taken
from
fernando
might
have
been
seen
to
receive
the
letter
and
might
have
been
searched
on
leaving
the
prison
but
that
would
not
account
for
his
silence
afterward
how
was
it
that
if
he
knew
of
the
letter
he
had
never
told
emilio
family
of
it
there
was
only
one
explanation
if
the
letter
had
been
taken
from
him
by
force
he
would
have
had
no
reason
for
concealing
its
existence
and
his
silence
was
clear
proof
that
he
had
given
it
up
voluntarily
no
doubt
in
the
hope
of
standing
well
with
the
authorities
but
then
he
was
a
traitor
and
a
coward
the
patriot
of
had
begun
life
as
an
informer
but
does
innate
character
ever
change
so
radically
that
the
lad
who
has
committed
a
base
act
at
fifteen
may
grow
up
into
an
honorable
man
a
good
man
may
be
corrupted
by
life
but
can
the
years
turn
a
born
sneak
into
a
hero
you
may
fancy
how
i
answered
my
own
questions
briga
had
been
false
and
cowardly
then
was
he
not
sure
to
be
false
and
cowardly
still
in
those
days
there
were
traitors
under
every
coat
and
more
than
one
brave
fellow
had
been
sold
to
the
police
by
his
best
friend
will
say
that
briga
record
was
unblemished
that
he
had
exposed
himself
to
danger
too
frequently
had
stood
by
his
friends
too
steadfastly
to
permit
of
a
rational
doubt
of
his
good
faith
so
reason
might
have
told
me
in
a
calmer
moment
but
she
was
not
allowed
to
make
herself
heard
just
then
i
was
young
i
was
angry
i
chose
to
think
i
had
been
unfairly
treated
and
perhaps
at
my
rival
instigation
it
was
not
unlikely
that
briga
knew
of
my
love
for
donna
candida
and
had
encouraged
her
to
use
it
in
the
good
cause
was
she
not
always
at
his
bidding
my
blood
boiled
at
the
thought
and
reaching
milan
in
a
rage
i
went
straight
to
donna
candida
i
had
measured
the
exact
force
of
the
blow
i
was
going
to
deal
the
triumph
of
the
liberals
in
modena
had
revived
public
interest
in
the
unsuccessful
struggle
of
their
predecessors
the
men
who
sixteen
years
earlier
had
paid
for
the
same
attempt
with
their
lives
the
victors
of
wished
to
honor
the
vanquished
of
all
the
families
exiled
by
the
ducal
government
were
hastening
back
to
recover
possession
of
their
confiscated
property
and
of
the
graves
of
their
dead
already
it
had
been
decided
to
raise
a
monument
to
menotti
and
his
companions
there
were
to
be
speeches
garlands
a
public
holiday
the
thrill
of
the
commemoration
would
run
through
europe
you
see
what
it
would
have
meant
to
the
poor
countess
to
appear
on
the
scene
with
her
boy
letter
in
her
hand
and
you
see
also
what
the
memorandum
on
the
back
of
the
letter
would
have
meant
to
donna
candida
poor
farewell
would
be
published
in
all
the
journals
of
europe
the
finding
of
the
letter
would
be
on
every
one
lips
and
how
conceal
those
fatal
words
on
the
back
at
the
moment
it
seemed
to
me
that
fortune
could
not
have
given
me
a
handsomer
chance
of
destroying
my
rival
than
in
letting
me
find
the
letter
which
he
stood
convicted
of
having
suppressed
my
sentiment
was
perhaps
not
a
strictly
honorable
one
yet
what
could
i
do
but
give
the
letter
to
donna
candida
to
keep
it
back
was
out
of
the
question
and
with
the
best
will
in
the
world
i
could
not
have
erased
briga
name
from
the
back
the
mistake
i
made
was
in
thinking
it
lucky
that
the
paper
had
fallen
into
my
hands
donna
candida
was
alone
when
i
entered
we
had
parted
in
anger
but
she
held
out
her
hand
with
a
smile
of
pardon
and
asked
what
news
i
brought
from
modena
the
smile
exasperated
me
i
felt
as
though
she
were
trying
to
get
me
into
her
power
again
i
bring
you
a
letter
from
your
brother
i
said
and
handed
it
to
her
i
had
purposely
turned
the
superscription
downward
so
that
she
should
not
see
it
she
uttered
an
incredulous
cry
and
tore
the
letter
open
a
light
struck
up
from
it
into
her
face
as
she
read
a
radiance
that
smote
me
to
the
soul
for
a
moment
i
longed
to
snatch
the
paper
from
her
and
efface
the
name
on
the
back
it
hurt
me
to
think
how
her
happiness
must
be
then
she
did
a
fatal
thing
she
came
up
to
me
caught
my
two
hands
and
kissed
them
oh
thank
you
bless
you
a
thousand
times
he
died
thinking
of
us
he
died
loving
italy
i
put
her
from
me
gently
it
was
not
the
kiss
i
wanted
and
the
touch
of
her
lips
hardened
me
she
shone
on
me
through
her
happy
tears
what
happiness
what
consolation
you
have
brought
my
poor
mother
this
will
take
the
bitterness
from
her
grief
and
that
it
should
come
to
her
now
do
you
know
she
had
a
presentiment
of
it
when
we
heard
of
the
duke
flight
her
first
word
was
we
may
find
emilio
letter
at
heart
she
was
always
sure
that
he
had
written
i
suppose
some
blessed
instinct
told
her
so
she
dropped
her
face
on
her
hands
and
i
saw
her
tears
fall
on
the
wretched
letter
in
a
moment
she
looked
up
again
with
eyes
that
blessed
and
trusted
me
tell
me
where
you
found
it
she
said
i
told
her
oh
the
savages
they
took
it
from
him
my
opportunity
had
come
no
i
said
it
appears
they
did
take
it
from
him
then
how
i
waited
a
moment
the
letter
i
said
looking
full
at
her
was
given
up
to
the
warder
of
the
prison
by
the
son
of
doctor
briga
she
stared
repeating
the
words
slowly
the
son
of
doctor
briga
but
that
is
fernando
she
said
i
have
always
understood
i
replied
that
your
friend
was
an
only
son
i
had
expected
an
outcry
of
horror
if
she
had
uttered
it
i
could
have
forgiven
her
anything
but
i
heard
instead
an
incredulous
exclamation
my
statement
was
really
too
preposterous
i
saw
that
her
mind
had
flashed
back
to
our
last
talk
and
that
she
charged
me
with
something
too
nearly
true
to
be
endurable
my
brother
letter
given
to
the
prison
warder
by
fernando
briga
my
dear
captain
alingdon
on
what
authority
do
you
expect
me
to
believe
such
a
tale
her
incredulity
had
in
it
an
evident
implication
of
bad
faith
and
i
was
stung
to
a
quick
reply
if
you
will
turn
over
the
letter
you
will
see
she
continued
to
gaze
at
me
a
moment
then
she
obeyed
i
do
think
i
ever
admired
her
more
than
i
did
then
as
she
read
the
name
a
tremor
crossed
her
face
and
that
was
all
her
mind
must
have
reached
out
instantly
to
the
farthest
consequences
of
the
discovery
but
the
long
habit
of
enabled
her
to
steady
her
muscles
at
once
if
i
had
not
been
on
the
alert
i
should
have
seen
no
hint
of
emotion
for
a
while
she
looked
fixedly
at
the
back
of
the
letter
then
she
raised
her
eyes
to
mine
can
you
tell
me
who
wrote
this
she
asked
her
composure
irritated
me
she
had
rallied
all
her
forces
to
defence
and
i
felt
as
though
my
triumph
were
slipping
from
me
probably
one
of
the
clerks
of
the
archives
i
answered
it
is
written
in
the
same
hand
as
all
the
other
memoranda
relating
to
the
political
prisoners
of
that
year
but
it
is
a
lie
she
exclaimed
he
was
never
admitted
to
the
prisons
are
you
sure
how
should
he
have
been
he
might
have
gone
as
his
father
assistant
but
if
he
had
seen
my
poor
brother
he
would
have
told
me
long
ago
not
if
he
had
really
given
up
this
letter
i
retorted
i
supposed
her
quick
intelligence
had
seized
this
from
the
first
but
i
saw
now
that
it
came
to
her
as
a
shock
she
stood
motionless
clenching
the
letter
in
her
hands
and
i
could
guess
the
rapid
travel
of
her
thoughts
suddenly
she
came
up
to
me
colonel
alingdon
she
said
you
have
been
a
good
friend
of
mine
though
i
think
you
have
not
liked
me
lately
but
whether
you
like
me
or
not
i
know
you
will
not
deceive
me
on
your
honor
do
you
think
this
memorandum
may
have
been
written
later
than
the
letter
i
hesitated
if
she
had
cried
out
once
against
briga
i
should
have
wished
myself
out
of
the
business
but
she
was
too
sure
of
him
on
my
honor
i
said
i
think
it
hardly
possible
the
ink
has
faded
to
the
same
degree
she
made
a
rapid
comparison
and
folded
the
letter
with
a
gesture
of
assent
it
may
have
been
written
by
an
enemy
i
went
on
wishing
to
clear
myself
of
any
appearance
of
malice
she
shook
her
head
he
was
barely
fifteen
and
his
father
was
on
the
side
of
the
government
besides
this
would
have
served
him
with
the
government
and
the
liberals
would
never
have
known
of
it
this
was
unanswerable
and
still
not
a
word
of
revolt
against
the
man
whose
condemnation
she
was
pronouncing
then
i
said
with
a
vague
gesture
she
caught
me
up
then
you
have
answered
my
objections
i
returned
your
objections
to
thinking
that
signor
briga
could
have
begun
his
career
as
a
patriot
by
betraying
a
friend
i
had
brought
her
to
the
test
at
last
but
my
eyes
shrank
from
her
face
as
i
spoke
there
was
a
dead
silence
which
i
broke
by
adding
lamely
but
no
doubt
signor
briga
could
explain
she
lifted
her
head
and
i
saw
that
my
triumph
was
to
be
short
she
stood
erect
a
few
paces
from
me
resting
her
hand
on
a
table
but
not
for
support
of
course
he
can
explain
she
said
do
you
suppose
i
ever
doubted
it
but
she
paused
a
moment
fronting
me
nobly
he
need
not
for
i
understand
it
all
now
ah
i
murmured
with
a
last
flicker
of
irony
i
understand
she
repeated
it
was
she
now
who
sought
my
eyes
and
held
them
it
is
quite
simple
he
could
not
have
done
otherwise
this
was
a
little
too
oracular
to
be
received
with
equanimity
i
suppose
i
smiled
he
could
not
have
done
otherwise
she
repeated
with
tranquil
emphasis
he
merely
did
what
is
every
italian
duty
he
put
italy
before
himself
and
his
friends
she
waited
a
moment
and
then
went
on
with
growing
passion
surely
you
must
see
what
i
mean
he
was
evidently
in
the
prison
with
his
father
at
the
time
of
my
poor
brother
death
emilio
perhaps
guessed
that
he
was
a
friend
or
perhaps
appealed
to
him
because
he
was
young
and
looked
kind
but
you
see
how
dangerous
it
would
have
been
for
briga
to
bring
this
letter
to
us
or
even
to
hide
it
in
his
father
house
it
is
true
that
he
was
not
yet
suspected
of
liberalism
but
he
was
already
connected
with
young
italy
and
it
is
just
because
he
managed
to
keep
himself
so
free
of
suspicion
that
he
was
able
to
do
such
good
work
for
the
cause
she
paused
and
then
went
on
with
a
firmer
voice
you
do
know
the
danger
we
all
lived
in
the
government
spies
were
everywhere
the
laws
were
set
aside
as
the
duke
pleased
was
not
emilio
hanged
for
having
an
ode
to
italy
in
his
desk
after
menotti
conspiracy
the
duke
grew
mad
with
fear
he
was
haunted
by
the
dread
of
assassination
the
police
to
prove
their
zeal
had
to
trump
up
false
charges
and
arrest
innocent
persons
you
remember
the
case
of
poor
ricci
incriminating
papers
were
smuggled
into
people
houses
they
were
condemned
to
death
on
the
paid
evidence
of
brigands
and
the
families
of
the
revolutionists
were
under
the
closest
observation
and
were
shunned
by
all
who
wished
to
stand
well
with
the
government
if
briga
had
been
seen
going
into
our
house
he
would
at
once
have
been
suspected
if
he
had
hidden
emilio
letter
at
home
its
discovery
might
have
ruined
his
family
as
well
as
himself
it
was
his
duty
to
consider
all
these
things
in
those
days
no
man
could
serve
two
masters
and
he
had
to
choose
between
endangering
the
cause
and
failing
to
serve
a
friend
he
chose
the
latter
and
he
was
right
i
stood
listening
fascinated
by
the
rapidity
and
skill
with
which
she
had
built
up
the
hypothesis
of
briga
defence
but
before
she
ended
a
strange
thing
happened
her
argument
had
convinced
me
it
seemed
to
me
quite
likely
that
briga
had
in
fact
been
actuated
by
the
motives
she
suggested
i
suppose
she
read
the
admission
in
my
face
for
hers
lit
up
victoriously
you
see
she
exclaimed
ah
it
takes
one
brave
man
to
understand
another
perhaps
i
winced
a
little
at
being
thus
coupled
with
her
hero
at
any
rate
some
last
impulse
of
resistance
made
me
say
i
should
be
quite
convinced
if
briga
had
only
spoken
of
the
letter
afterward
if
brave
people
understand
each
other
i
can
not
see
why
he
should
have
been
afraid
of
telling
you
the
truth
she
colored
deeply
and
perhaps
not
quite
resentfully
you
are
right
she
said
he
need
not
have
been
afraid
but
he
does
not
know
me
as
i
know
him
i
was
useful
to
italy
and
he
may
have
feared
to
risk
my
friendship
you
are
the
most
generous
woman
i
ever
knew
i
exclaimed
she
looked
at
me
intently
you
also
are
generous
she
said
i
stiffened
instantly
suspecting
a
purpose
behind
her
praise
i
have
given
you
small
proof
of
it
i
said
she
seemed
surprised
in
bringing
me
this
letter
what
else
could
you
do
she
sighed
deeply
you
can
give
me
proof
enough
now
she
had
dropped
into
a
chair
and
i
saw
that
we
had
reached
the
most
difficult
point
in
our
interview
captain
alingdon
she
said
does
any
one
else
know
of
this
letter
no
i
was
alone
in
the
archives
when
i
found
it
and
you
spoke
of
it
to
no
one
to
no
one
then
no
one
must
know
i
bowed
it
is
for
you
to
decide
she
paused
not
even
my
mother
she
continued
with
a
painful
blush
i
looked
at
her
in
amazement
not
even
she
shook
her
head
sadly
you
think
me
a
cruel
daughter
well
was
a
cruel
friend
what
he
did
was
done
for
italy
shall
i
allow
myself
to
be
surpassed
i
felt
a
pang
of
commiseration
for
the
mother
but
you
will
at
least
tell
the
countess
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
my
poor
mother
do
make
it
more
difficult
for
me
but
i
do
understand
do
you
see
that
she
might
find
it
impossible
to
forgive
him
she
has
suffered
so
much
and
i
ca
risk
that
for
in
her
anger
she
might
speak
and
even
if
she
forgave
him
she
might
be
tempted
to
show
the
letter
do
you
see
that
even
now
a
word
of
this
might
ruin
him
i
will
trust
his
fate
to
no
one
if
italy
needed
him
then
she
needs
him
far
more
she
stood
before
me
magnificently
in
the
splendor
of
her
great
refusal
then
she
turned
to
the
at
which
she
had
been
seated
when
i
came
in
her
was
still
alight
and
she
held
her
brother
letter
to
the
flame
i
watched
her
in
silence
while
it
burned
but
one
more
question
rose
to
my
lips
you
will
tell
then
what
you
have
done
for
him
i
cried
and
at
that
the
heroine
turned
woman
melted
and
pressed
unhappy
hands
in
mine
do
you
see
that
i
can
never
tell
him
what
i
do
for
him
that
is
my
gift
to
italy
she
said
the
dilettante
it
was
on
an
impulse
hardly
needing
the
arguments
he
found
himself
advancing
in
its
favor
that
thursdale
on
his
way
to
the
club
turned
as
usual
into
vervain
street
the
as
usual
was
his
own
qualification
of
the
act
a
convenient
way
of
bridging
the
interval
in
days
and
other
sequences
that
lay
between
this
visit
and
the
last
it
was
characteristic
of
him
that
he
instinctively
excluded
his
call
two
days
earlier
with
ruth
gaynor
from
the
list
of
his
visits
to
vervain
the
special
conditions
attending
it
had
made
it
no
more
like
a
visit
to
vervain
than
an
engraved
dinner
invitation
is
like
a
personal
letter
yet
it
was
to
talk
over
his
call
with
miss
gaynor
that
he
was
now
returning
to
the
scene
of
that
episode
and
it
was
because
vervain
could
be
trusted
to
handle
the
talking
over
as
skilfully
as
the
interview
itself
that
at
her
corner
he
had
felt
the
dilettante
irresistible
craving
to
take
a
last
look
at
a
work
of
art
that
was
passing
out
of
his
possession
on
the
whole
he
knew
no
one
better
fitted
to
deal
with
the
unexpected
than
vervain
she
excelled
in
the
rare
art
of
taking
things
for
granted
and
thursdale
felt
a
pardonable
pride
in
the
thought
that
she
owed
her
excellence
to
his
training
early
in
his
career
thursdale
had
made
the
mistake
at
the
outset
of
his
acquaintance
with
a
lady
of
telling
her
that
he
loved
her
and
exacting
the
same
avowal
in
return
the
latter
part
of
that
episode
had
been
like
the
long
walk
back
from
a
picnic
when
one
has
to
carry
all
the
crockery
one
has
finished
using
it
was
the
last
time
thursdale
ever
allowed
himself
to
be
encumbered
with
the
debris
of
a
feast
he
thus
incidentally
learned
that
the
privilege
of
loving
her
is
one
of
the
least
favors
that
a
charming
woman
can
accord
and
in
seeking
to
avoid
the
pitfalls
of
sentiment
he
had
developed
a
science
of
evasion
in
which
the
woman
of
the
moment
became
a
mere
implement
of
the
game
he
owed
a
great
deal
of
delicate
enjoyment
to
the
cultivation
of
this
art
the
perils
from
which
it
had
been
his
refuge
became
naively
harmless
was
it
possible
that
he
who
now
took
his
easy
way
along
the
levels
had
once
preferred
to
gasp
on
the
raw
heights
of
emotion
youth
is
a
season
but
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
feeling
that
he
had
entered
earlier
than
most
into
that
of
sensation
where
every
has
its
value
as
a
promoter
of
this
pleasure
no
one
he
had
known
was
comparable
to
vervain
he
had
taught
a
good
many
women
not
to
betray
their
feelings
but
he
had
never
before
had
such
fine
material
to
work
in
she
had
been
surprisingly
crude
when
he
first
knew
her
capable
of
making
the
most
awkward
inferences
of
plunging
through
thin
ice
of
recklessly
undressing
her
emotions
but
she
had
acquired
under
the
discipline
of
his
reticences
and
evasions
a
skill
almost
equal
to
his
own
and
perhaps
more
remarkable
in
that
it
involved
keeping
time
with
any
tune
he
played
and
reading
at
sight
some
uncommonly
difficult
passages
it
had
taken
thursdale
seven
years
to
form
this
fine
talent
but
the
result
justified
the
effort
at
the
crucial
moment
she
had
been
perfect
her
way
of
greeting
miss
gaynor
had
made
him
regret
that
he
had
announced
his
engagement
by
letter
it
was
an
evasion
that
confessed
a
difficulty
a
deviation
implying
an
obstacle
where
by
common
consent
it
was
agreed
to
see
none
it
betrayed
in
short
a
lack
of
confidence
in
the
completeness
of
his
method
it
had
been
his
pride
never
to
put
himself
in
a
position
which
had
to
be
quitted
as
it
were
by
the
back
door
but
here
as
he
perceived
the
main
portals
would
have
opened
for
him
of
their
own
accord
all
this
and
much
more
he
read
in
the
finished
naturalness
with
which
vervain
had
met
miss
gaynor
he
had
never
seen
a
better
piece
of
work
there
was
no
no
suspicious
warmth
above
all
and
this
gave
her
art
the
grace
of
a
natural
quality
there
were
none
of
those
damnable
implications
whereby
a
woman
in
welcoming
her
friend
betrothed
may
keep
him
on
pins
and
needles
while
she
laps
the
lady
in
complacency
so
masterly
a
performance
indeed
hardly
needed
the
offset
of
miss
gaynor
words
to
be
so
kind
to
me
how
she
must
have
liked
you
though
he
caught
himself
wishing
it
lay
within
the
bounds
of
fitness
to
transmit
them
as
a
final
tribute
to
the
one
woman
he
knew
who
was
unfailingly
certain
to
enjoy
a
good
thing
it
was
perhaps
the
one
drawback
to
his
new
situation
that
it
might
develop
good
things
which
it
would
be
impossible
to
hand
on
to
margaret
vervain
the
fact
that
he
had
made
the
mistake
of
underrating
his
powers
the
consciousness
that
his
writing
must
have
betrayed
his
distrust
of
her
efficiency
seemed
an
added
reason
for
turning
down
her
street
instead
of
going
on
to
the
club
he
would
show
her
that
he
knew
how
to
value
her
he
would
ask
her
to
achieve
with
him
a
feat
infinitely
rarer
and
more
delicate
than
the
one
he
had
appeared
to
avoid
incidentally
he
would
also
dispose
of
the
interval
of
time
before
dinner
ever
since
he
had
seen
miss
gaynor
off
an
hour
earlier
on
her
return
journey
to
buffalo
he
had
been
wondering
how
he
should
put
in
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
it
was
absurd
how
he
missed
the
girl
that
was
it
the
desire
to
talk
about
her
was
after
all
at
the
bottom
of
his
impulse
to
call
on
vervain
it
was
absurd
if
you
like
but
it
was
delightfully
rejuvenating
he
could
recall
the
time
when
he
had
been
afraid
of
being
obvious
now
he
felt
that
this
return
to
the
primitive
emotions
might
be
as
restorative
as
a
holiday
in
the
canadian
woods
and
it
was
precisely
by
the
girl
candor
her
directness
her
lack
of
complications
that
he
was
taken
the
sense
that
she
might
say
something
rash
at
any
moment
was
positively
exhilarating
if
she
had
thrown
her
arms
about
him
at
the
station
he
would
not
have
given
a
thought
to
his
crumpled
dignity
it
surprised
thursdale
to
find
what
freshness
of
heart
he
brought
to
the
adventure
and
though
his
sense
of
irony
prevented
his
ascribing
his
intactness
to
any
conscious
purpose
he
could
but
rejoice
in
the
fact
that
his
sentimental
economies
had
left
him
such
a
large
surplus
to
draw
upon
vervain
was
at
home
as
usual
when
one
visits
the
cemetery
one
expects
to
find
the
angel
on
the
tombstone
and
it
struck
thursdale
as
another
proof
of
his
friend
good
taste
that
she
had
been
in
no
undue
haste
to
change
her
habits
the
whole
house
appeared
to
count
on
his
coming
the
footman
took
his
hat
and
overcoat
as
naturally
as
though
there
had
been
no
lapse
in
his
visits
and
the
at
once
enveloped
him
in
that
atmosphere
of
tacit
intelligence
which
vervain
imparted
to
her
very
furniture
it
was
a
surprise
that
in
this
general
harmony
of
circumstances
vervain
should
herself
sound
the
first
false
note
you
she
exclaimed
and
the
book
she
held
slipped
from
her
hand
it
was
crude
certainly
unless
it
were
a
touch
of
the
finest
art
the
difficulty
of
classifying
it
disturbed
thursdale
balance
why
not
he
said
restoring
the
book
is
it
my
hour
and
as
she
made
no
answer
he
added
gently
unless
it
some
one
else
she
laid
the
book
aside
and
sank
back
into
her
chair
mine
merely
she
said
i
hope
that
does
mean
that
you
unwilling
to
share
it
with
you
by
no
means
you
welcome
to
my
last
crust
he
looked
at
her
reproachfully
do
you
call
this
the
last
she
smiled
as
he
dropped
into
the
seat
across
the
hearth
it
a
way
of
giving
it
more
flavor
he
returned
the
smile
a
visit
to
you
does
need
such
condiments
she
took
this
with
just
the
right
measure
of
retrospective
amusement
ah
but
i
want
to
put
into
this
one
a
very
special
taste
she
confessed
her
smile
was
so
confident
so
reassuring
that
it
lulled
him
into
the
imprudence
of
saying
why
should
you
want
it
to
be
different
from
what
was
always
so
perfectly
right
she
hesitated
does
the
fact
that
it
the
last
constitute
a
difference
the
last
my
last
visit
to
you
oh
metaphorically
i
mean
there
a
break
in
the
continuity
decidedly
she
was
pressing
too
hard
unlearning
his
arts
already
i
do
recognize
it
he
said
unless
you
make
me
he
added
with
a
note
that
slightly
stirred
her
attitude
of
languid
attention
she
turned
to
him
with
grave
eyes
you
recognize
no
difference
whatever
none
except
an
added
link
in
the
chain
an
added
link
in
having
one
more
thing
to
like
you
for
your
letting
miss
gaynor
see
why
i
had
already
so
many
he
flattered
himself
that
this
turn
had
taken
the
least
hint
of
fatuity
from
the
phrase
vervain
sank
into
her
former
easy
pose
was
it
that
you
came
for
she
asked
almost
gaily
if
it
is
necessary
to
have
a
reason
that
was
one
to
talk
to
me
about
miss
gaynor
to
tell
you
how
she
talks
about
you
that
will
be
very
interesting
especially
if
you
have
seen
her
since
her
second
visit
to
me
her
second
visit
thursdale
pushed
his
chair
back
with
a
start
and
moved
to
another
she
came
to
see
you
again
this
morning
yes
by
appointment
he
continued
to
look
at
her
blankly
you
sent
for
her
i
did
have
to
she
wrote
and
asked
me
last
night
but
no
doubt
you
have
seen
her
since
thursdale
sat
silent
he
was
trying
to
separate
his
words
from
his
thoughts
but
they
still
clung
together
inextricably
i
saw
her
off
just
now
at
the
station
and
she
did
tell
you
that
she
had
been
here
again
there
was
hardly
time
i
suppose
there
were
people
about
he
floundered
ah
she
write
then
he
regained
his
composure
of
course
she
write
very
often
i
hope
you
know
i
absurdly
in
love
he
cried
audaciously
she
tilted
her
head
back
looking
up
at
him
as
he
leaned
against
the
he
had
leaned
there
so
often
that
the
attitude
touched
a
pulse
which
set
up
a
throbbing
in
her
throat
oh
my
poor
thursdale
she
murmured
i
suppose
it
rather
ridiculous
he
owned
and
as
she
remained
silent
he
added
with
a
sudden
break
or
have
you
another
reason
for
pitying
me
her
answer
was
another
question
have
you
been
back
to
your
rooms
since
you
left
her
since
i
left
her
at
the
station
i
came
straight
here
ah
yes
you
there
was
no
reason
her
words
passed
into
a
silent
musing
thursdale
moved
nervously
nearer
you
said
you
had
something
to
tell
me
perhaps
i
had
better
let
her
do
so
there
may
be
a
letter
at
your
rooms
a
letter
what
do
you
mean
a
letter
from
what
has
happened
his
paleness
shook
her
and
she
raised
a
hand
of
reassurance
nothing
has
happened
perhaps
that
is
just
the
worst
of
it
you
always
you
know
she
added
incoherently
to
have
things
happen
you
never
would
let
them
and
now
well
that
was
what
she
came
here
for
i
supposed
you
had
guessed
to
know
if
anything
had
happened
had
happened
he
gazed
at
her
slowly
between
you
and
me
he
said
with
a
rush
of
light
the
words
were
so
much
cruder
than
any
that
had
ever
passed
between
them
that
the
color
rose
to
her
face
but
she
held
his
startled
gaze
you
know
girls
are
not
quite
as
unsophisticated
as
they
used
to
be
are
you
surprised
that
such
an
idea
should
occur
to
her
his
own
color
answered
hers
it
was
the
only
reply
that
came
to
him
vervain
went
on
smoothly
i
supposed
it
might
have
struck
you
that
there
were
times
when
we
presented
that
appearance
he
made
an
impatient
gesture
a
man
past
is
his
own
perhaps
it
certainly
never
belongs
to
the
woman
who
has
shared
it
but
one
learns
such
truths
only
by
experience
and
miss
gaynor
is
naturally
inexperienced
of
course
but
supposing
her
act
a
natural
one
he
floundered
lamentably
among
his
innuendoes
i
still
do
see
how
there
was
anything
anything
to
take
hold
of
there
was
well
then
escaped
him
in
crude
satisfaction
but
as
she
did
not
complete
the
sentence
he
went
on
with
a
faltering
laugh
she
can
hardly
object
to
the
existence
of
a
mere
friendship
between
us
but
she
does
said
vervain
thursdale
stood
perplexed
he
had
seen
on
the
previous
day
no
trace
of
jealousy
or
resentment
in
his
betrothed
he
could
still
hear
the
candid
ring
of
the
girl
praise
of
vervain
if
she
were
such
an
abyss
of
insincerity
as
to
dissemble
distrust
under
such
frankness
she
must
at
least
be
more
subtle
than
to
bring
her
doubts
to
her
rival
for
solution
the
situation
seemed
one
through
which
one
could
no
longer
move
in
a
penumbra
and
he
let
in
a
burst
of
light
with
the
direct
query
wo
you
explain
what
you
mean
vervain
sat
silent
not
provokingly
as
though
to
prolong
his
distress
but
as
if
in
the
attenuated
phraseology
he
had
taught
her
it
was
difficult
to
find
words
robust
enough
to
meet
his
challenge
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
asked
her
to
explain
anything
and
she
had
lived
so
long
in
dread
of
offering
elucidations
which
were
not
wanted
that
she
seemed
unable
to
produce
one
on
the
spot
at
last
she
said
slowly
she
came
to
find
out
if
you
were
really
free
thursdale
colored
again
free
he
stammered
with
a
sense
of
physical
disgust
at
contact
with
such
crassness
yes
if
i
had
quite
done
with
you
she
smiled
in
recovered
security
it
seems
she
likes
clear
outlines
she
has
a
passion
for
definitions
yes
well
he
said
wincing
at
the
echo
of
his
own
subtlety
well
and
when
i
told
her
that
you
had
never
belonged
to
me
she
wanted
me
to
define
status
to
know
exactly
where
i
had
stood
all
along
thursdale
sat
gazing
at
her
intently
his
hand
was
not
yet
on
the
clue
and
even
when
you
had
told
her
that
even
when
i
had
told
her
that
i
had
no
status
that
i
had
never
stood
anywhere
in
any
sense
she
meant
said
vervain
slowly
even
then
she
was
satisfied
it
seems
he
uttered
an
uneasy
exclamation
she
did
believe
you
you
mean
i
mean
that
she
believe
me
too
thoroughly
well
then
in
god
name
what
did
she
want
something
more
those
were
the
words
she
used
something
more
between
between
you
and
me
is
it
a
conundrum
he
laughed
awkwardly
girls
are
not
what
they
were
in
my
day
they
are
no
longer
forbidden
to
contemplate
the
relation
of
the
sexes
so
it
seems
he
commented
but
since
in
this
case
there
any
he
broke
off
catching
the
dawn
of
a
revelation
in
her
gaze
that
just
it
the
unpardonable
offence
has
been
in
our
not
offending
he
flung
himself
down
despairingly
i
give
it
up
what
did
you
tell
her
he
burst
out
with
sudden
crudeness
the
exact
truth
if
i
had
only
known
she
broke
off
with
a
beseeching
tenderness
wo
you
believe
that
i
would
still
have
lied
for
you
lied
for
me
why
on
earth
should
you
have
lied
for
either
of
us
to
save
you
to
hide
you
from
her
to
the
last
as
i
hidden
you
from
myself
all
these
years
she
stood
up
with
a
sudden
tragic
import
in
her
movement
you
believe
me
capable
of
that
do
you
if
i
had
only
guessed
but
i
have
never
known
a
girl
like
her
she
had
the
truth
out
of
me
with
a
spring
the
truth
that
you
and
i
had
never
had
never
never
in
all
these
years
oh
she
knew
why
she
measured
us
both
in
a
flash
she
did
suspect
me
of
having
haggled
with
you
her
words
pelted
me
like
hail
just
took
what
he
wanted
sifted
and
sorted
you
to
suit
his
taste
burnt
out
the
gold
and
left
a
heap
of
cinders
and
you
let
him
you
let
yourself
be
cut
in
bits
she
mixed
her
metaphors
a
little
cut
in
bits
and
used
or
discarded
while
all
the
while
every
drop
of
blood
in
you
belonged
to
him
but
shylock
and
you
have
bled
to
death
of
the
pound
of
flesh
he
has
cut
out
of
you
but
she
despises
me
the
most
you
know
far
the
most
vervain
ended
the
words
fell
strangely
on
the
scented
stillness
of
the
room
they
seemed
out
of
harmony
with
its
setting
of
afternoon
intimacy
the
kind
of
intimacy
on
which
at
any
moment
a
visitor
might
intrude
without
perceptibly
lowering
the
atmosphere
it
was
as
though
a
grand
had
strained
the
acoustics
of
a
private
thursdale
stood
up
facing
his
hostess
half
the
room
was
between
them
but
they
seemed
to
stare
close
at
each
other
now
that
the
veils
of
reticence
and
ambiguity
had
fallen
his
first
words
were
characteristic
she
despise
me
then
he
exclaimed
she
thinks
the
pound
of
flesh
you
took
was
a
little
too
near
the
heart
he
was
excessively
pale
please
tell
me
exactly
what
she
said
of
me
she
did
not
speak
much
of
you
she
is
proud
but
i
gather
that
while
she
understands
love
or
indifference
her
eyes
have
never
been
opened
to
the
many
intermediate
shades
of
feeling
at
any
rate
she
expressed
an
unwillingness
to
be
taken
with
reservations
she
thinks
you
would
have
loved
her
better
if
you
had
loved
some
one
else
first
the
point
of
view
is
original
she
insists
on
a
man
with
a
past
oh
a
past
if
she
serious
i
could
rake
up
a
past
he
said
with
a
laugh
so
i
suggested
but
she
has
her
eyes
on
his
particular
portion
of
it
she
insists
on
making
it
a
test
case
she
wanted
to
know
what
you
had
done
to
me
and
before
i
could
guess
her
drift
i
blundered
into
telling
her
thursdale
drew
a
difficult
breath
i
never
supposed
your
revenge
is
complete
he
said
slowly
he
heard
a
little
gasp
in
her
throat
my
revenge
when
i
sent
for
you
to
warn
you
to
save
you
from
being
surprised
as
was
surprised
you
very
good
but
it
rather
late
to
talk
of
saving
me
he
held
out
his
hand
in
the
mechanical
gesture
of
how
you
must
care
for
i
never
saw
you
so
dull
was
her
answer
do
you
see
that
it
not
too
late
for
me
to
help
you
and
as
he
continued
to
stare
she
brought
out
sublimely
take
the
rest
in
imagination
let
it
at
least
be
of
that
much
use
to
you
tell
her
i
lied
to
her
she
too
ready
to
believe
it
and
so
after
all
in
a
sense
i
have
been
wasted
his
stare
hung
on
her
widening
to
a
kind
of
wonder
she
gave
the
look
back
brightly
unblushingly
as
though
the
expedient
were
too
simple
to
need
oblique
approaches
it
was
extraordinary
how
a
few
words
had
swept
them
from
an
atmosphere
of
the
most
complex
dissimulations
to
this
contact
of
naked
souls
it
was
not
in
thursdale
to
expand
with
the
pressure
of
fate
but
something
in
him
cracked
with
it
and
the
rift
let
in
new
light
he
went
up
to
his
friend
and
took
her
hand
you
would
do
it
you
would
do
it
she
looked
at
him
smiling
but
her
hand
shook
he
said
kissing
it
you
are
going
to
get
my
letter
your
letter
the
letter
wo
matter
if
you
will
only
do
what
i
ask
he
returned
her
gaze
i
might
i
suppose
without
being
out
of
character
only
do
you
see
that
if
your
plan
helped
me
it
could
only
harm
her
harm
to
sacrifice
you
would
make
me
different
i
shall
go
on
being
what
i
have
always
been
sifting
and
sorting
as
she
calls
it
do
you
want
my
punishment
to
fall
on
she
looked
at
him
long
and
deeply
ah
if
i
had
to
choose
between
you
you
would
let
her
take
her
chance
but
i
ca
you
see
i
must
take
my
punishment
alone
she
drew
her
hand
away
sighing
oh
there
will
be
no
punishment
for
either
of
you
for
either
of
us
there
will
be
the
reading
of
her
letter
for
me
she
shook
her
head
with
a
slight
laugh
there
will
be
no
letter
thursdale
faced
about
from
the
threshold
with
fresh
life
in
his
look
no
letter
you
do
mean
i
mean
that
she
been
with
you
since
i
saw
her
she
seen
you
and
heard
your
voice
if
there
a
letter
she
has
recalled
it
from
the
first
station
by
telegraph
he
turned
back
to
the
door
forcing
an
answer
to
her
smile
but
in
the
mean
while
i
shall
have
read
it
he
said
the
door
closed
on
him
and
she
hid
her
eyes
from
the
dreadful
emptiness
of
the
room
the
quicksand
i
as
quentin
victoria
driving
homeward
turned
from
the
park
into
fifth
avenue
she
divined
her
son
tall
figure
walking
ahead
of
her
in
the
twilight
his
long
stride
covered
the
ground
more
rapidly
than
usual
and
she
had
a
premonition
that
if
he
were
going
home
at
that
hour
it
was
because
he
wanted
to
see
her
quentin
though
not
a
fanciful
woman
was
sometimes
aware
of
a
sixth
sense
enabling
her
to
detect
the
faintest
vibrations
of
her
impulses
she
was
too
shrewd
to
fancy
herself
the
one
mother
in
possession
of
this
faculty
but
she
permitted
herself
to
think
that
few
could
exercise
it
more
discreetly
if
she
could
not
help
overhearing
alan
thoughts
she
had
the
courage
to
keep
her
discoveries
to
herself
the
tact
to
take
for
granted
nothing
that
lay
below
the
surface
of
their
spoken
intercourse
she
knew
that
most
people
would
rather
have
their
letters
read
than
their
thoughts
for
this
superfeminine
discretion
alan
repaid
her
by
being
alan
there
could
have
been
no
completer
reward
he
was
the
key
to
the
meaning
of
life
the
justification
of
what
must
have
seemed
as
incomprehensible
as
it
was
odious
had
it
not
ended
in
himself
he
was
a
perfect
son
and
quentin
had
always
hungered
for
perfection
her
house
in
a
minor
way
bore
witness
to
the
craving
one
felt
it
to
be
the
result
of
a
series
of
eliminations
there
was
nothing
fortuitous
in
its
blending
of
line
and
color
the
almost
morbid
finish
of
every
material
detail
of
her
life
suggested
the
possibility
that
a
diversity
of
energies
had
by
some
pressure
of
circumstance
been
forced
into
the
channel
of
a
narrow
dilettanteism
quentin
fastidiousness
had
indeed
the
flaw
of
being
too
her
friends
were
not
always
worthy
of
the
chairs
they
sat
in
and
she
overlooked
in
her
associates
defects
she
would
not
have
tolerated
in
her
her
house
was
in
fact
never
so
distinguished
as
when
it
was
empty
and
it
was
at
its
best
in
the
warm
silence
that
now
received
her
her
son
who
had
overtaken
her
on
the
followed
her
into
the
and
threw
himself
into
an
armchair
near
the
fire
while
she
laid
off
her
furs
and
busied
herself
about
the
tea
table
for
a
while
neither
spoke
but
glancing
at
him
across
the
kettle
his
mother
noticed
that
he
sat
staring
at
the
embers
with
a
look
she
had
never
seen
on
his
face
though
its
arrogant
young
outline
was
as
familiar
to
her
as
her
own
thoughts
the
look
extended
itself
to
his
negligent
attitude
to
the
droop
of
his
long
fine
hands
the
dejected
tilt
of
his
head
against
the
cushions
it
was
like
the
moral
equivalent
of
physical
fatigue
he
looked
as
he
himself
would
have
phrased
it
played
out
such
an
air
was
so
foreign
to
his
usual
bright
indomitableness
that
quentin
had
the
sense
of
an
unfamiliar
presence
in
which
she
must
observe
herself
must
raise
hurried
barriers
against
an
alien
approach
it
was
one
of
the
drawbacks
of
their
excessive
intimacy
that
any
break
in
it
seemed
a
chasm
she
was
accustomed
to
let
his
thoughts
circle
about
her
before
they
settled
into
speech
and
she
now
sat
in
motionless
expectancy
as
though
a
sound
might
frighten
them
away
at
length
without
turning
his
eyes
from
the
fire
he
said
i
so
glad
you
a
nice
intuitive
woman
it
painful
to
see
them
think
her
apprehension
had
already
preceded
him
hope
fenno
she
faltered
he
nodded
she
been
thinking
hard
it
was
very
painful
to
me
at
least
and
i
do
believe
she
enjoyed
it
she
said
she
did
he
stretched
his
feet
to
the
fire
the
result
of
her
cogitations
is
that
she
wo
have
me
she
arrived
at
this
by
pure
ratiocination
it
not
a
question
of
feeling
you
understand
i
the
only
man
she
ever
loved
but
she
wo
have
me
what
novels
did
you
read
when
you
were
young
dear
i
convinced
it
all
turns
on
that
if
she
been
brought
up
on
trollope
and
instead
of
tolstoi
and
ward
we
should
have
now
been
vulgarly
sitting
on
a
sofa
trying
on
the
quentin
at
first
was
kept
silent
by
the
mother
instinctive
anger
that
the
girl
she
has
not
wanted
for
her
son
should
have
dared
to
refuse
him
then
she
said
tell
me
dear
my
good
woman
she
has
scruples
scruples
against
the
paper
she
objects
to
me
in
my
official
capacity
as
owner
of
the
his
mother
did
not
echo
his
laugh
she
had
found
a
solution
of
course
she
overflows
with
expedients
i
was
to
chuck
the
paper
and
we
were
to
live
happily
ever
afterward
on
canned
food
and
virtue
she
even
had
an
alternative
ready
women
are
so
full
of
resources
i
was
to
turn
the
into
an
independent
organ
and
run
it
at
a
loss
to
show
the
public
what
a
model
newspaper
ought
to
be
on
the
whole
i
think
she
fancied
this
plan
more
than
the
other
it
commended
itself
to
her
as
being
more
uncomfortable
and
aggressive
it
not
the
fashion
nowadays
to
be
good
by
stealth
quentin
said
to
herself
i
did
know
how
much
he
cared
aloud
she
murmured
you
must
give
her
time
time
to
move
out
the
old
prejudices
and
make
room
for
new
ones
my
dear
mother
those
she
has
are
that
the
trouble
with
them
she
tremendously
she
takes
in
all
the
moral
and
wears
the
newest
thing
in
ethics
her
resentment
lost
its
way
in
the
intricacies
of
his
metaphor
is
she
so
very
religious
you
dear
archaic
woman
she
hopelessly

that
the
difficulty
you
can
make
a
religious
woman
believe
almost
anything
there
the
habit
of
credulity
to
work
on
but
when
a
girl
faith
in
the
deluge
has
been
shaken
it
very
hard
to
inspire
her
with
confidence
she
makes
you
feel
that
before
believing
in
you
it
her
duty
as
a
conscientious
agnostic
to
find
out
whether
you
not
obsolete
or
whether
the
text
is
corrupt
or
somebody
has
proved
conclusively
that
you
never
existed
anyhow
quentin
was
again
silent
the
two
moved
in
that
atmosphere
of
implications
and
assumptions
where
the
lightest
word
may
shake
down
the
dust
of
countless
stored
impressions
and
speech
was
sometimes
more
difficult
between
them
than
had
their
union
been
less
close
presently
she
ventured
it
impossible
impossible
she
seemed
to
use
her
words
cautiously
like
weapons
that
might
slip
and
inflict
a
cut

she
suggests
her
son
raising
himself
turned
to
look
at
her
for
the
first
time
their
glance
met
in
a
shock
of
comprehension
he
was
with
her
against
the
girl
then
her
satisfaction
overflowed
in
a
murmur
of
tenderness
of
course
not

that
what
i
tell
her
what
the
use
of
my
giving
up
the
paper
if
i
keep
my
point
of
view
the
psychological
distinction
attracted
her
which
is
it
she
minds
most
oh
the
paper
for
the
present
she
undertakes
to
modify
the
point
of
view
afterward
all
she
asks
is
that
i
shall
renounce
my
heresy
the
gift
of
grace
will
come
later
quentin
sat
gazing
into
her
untouched
cup
her
son
first
words
had
produced
in
her
the
hallucinated
sense
of
struggling
in
the
thick
of
a
crowd
that
he
could
not
see
it
was
horrible
to
feel
herself
hemmed
in
by
influences
imperceptible
to
him
yet
if
anything
could
have
increased
her
misery
it
would
have
been
the
discovery
that
her
ghosts
had
become
visible
as
though
to
divert
his
attention
she
precipitately
asked
and
you
his
answer
carried
the
shock
of
an
evocation
i
merely
asked
her
what
she
thought
of
of
me
she
admires
you
immensely
you
know
for
a
moment
quentin
cheek
showed
the
lingering
light
of
girlhood
praise
transmitted
by
her
son
acquired
something
of
the
transmitter
merit
well
she
smiled
well
you
did
make
my
father
give
up
the
did
you
his
mother
stiffening
made
a
circuitous
return
she
never
comes
here
how
can
she
know
me
she
so
poor
she
goes
out
so
little
he
rose
and
leaned
against
the
dislodging
with
impatient
fingers
a
slender
bronze
wrestler
poised
on
a
porphyry
base
between
two
spanish
ivories
and
then
her
mother
he
added
as
if
involuntarily
her
mother
has
never
visited
me
quentin
finished
for
him
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
fenno
has
the
scope
of
a
wax
doll
her
rule
of
conduct
is
taken
from
her
grandmother
sampler
but
the
daughter
is
so
modern
and
yet
the
result
is
the
same
not
exactly
admires
you
oh
immensely
he
replaced
the
bronze
and
turned
to
his
mother
with
a
smile
are
you
on
some
hospital
committee
together
what
especially
strikes
her
is
your
way
of
doing
good
she
says
philanthropy
is
not
a
line
of
conduct
but
a
state
of
mind
and
it
appears
that
you
are
one
of
the
elect
as
in
the
vague
diffusion
of
physical
pain
relief
seems
to
come
with
the
acuter
pang
of
a
single
nerve
quentin
felt
herself
suddenly
eased
by
a
rush
of
anger
against
the
girl
if
she
loved
you
she
began
his
gesture
checked
her
i
not
asking
you
to
get
her
to
do
that
the
two
were
again
silent
facing
each
other
in
the
disarray
of
a
common
catastrophe
as
though
their
thoughts
at
the
summons
of
danger
had
rushed
naked
into
action
quentin
at
this
revealing
moment
saw
for
the
first
time
how
many
elements
of
her
son
character
had
seemed
comprehensible
simply
because
they
were
familiar
as
in
reading
a
foreign
language
we
take
the
meaning
of
certain
words
for
granted
till
the
context
corrects
us
often
as
in
a
given
case
her
maternal
musings
had
figured
his
conduct
she
now
found
herself
at
a
loss
to
forecast
it
and
with
this
failure
of
intuition
came
a
sense
of
the
subserviency
which
had
hitherto
made
her
counsels
but
the
anticipation
of
his
wish
her
despair
escaped
in
the
moan
what
it
you
ask
me
to
talk
to
her
talk
to
her
show
her
tell
her
make
her
understand
that
the
paper
has
always
been
a
thing
outside
your
life
that
has
touched
you
that
need
touch
only
let
her
hear
you
watch
you
be
with
you
she
see
she
ca
help
seeing
his
mother
faltered
but
if
she
given
you
her
reasons
let
her
give
them
to
you
if
she
can
when
she
sees
you
his
impatient
hand
again
displaced
the
wrestler

care
abominably
he
confessed
ii
on
the
fenno
threshold
a
sudden
sense
of
the
futility
of
the
attempt
had
almost
driven
quentin
back
to
her
carriage
but
the
door
was
already
opening
and
a
who
believed
that
miss
fenno
was
in
led
the
way
to
the
depressing
it
was
the
kind
of
room
in
which
no
member
of
the
family
is
likely
to
be
found
except
after
dinner
or
after
death
the
chairs
and
tables
looked
like
poor
relations
who
had
repaid
their
keep
by
a
long
career
of
grudging
usefulness
they
seemed
banded
together
against
intruders
in
a
sullen
conspiracy
of
discomfort
quentin
keenly
susceptible
to
such
influences
read
failure
in
every
angle
of
the
upholstery
she
was
incapable
of
the
vulgar
error
of
thinking
that
hope
fenno
might
be
induced
to
marry
alan
for
his
money
but
between
this
assumption
and
the
inference
that
the
girl
imagination
might
be
touched
by
the
finer
possibilities
of
wealth
good
taste
admitted
a
distinction
the
fenno
furniture
however
presented
to
such
reasoning
the
obtuseness
of
its
chamferings
and
something
in
its
attitude
suggested
that
its
owners
would
be
as
uncompromising
the
room
showed
none
of
the
modern
attempts
at
palliation
no
apologetic
draping
of
facts
and
quentin
provisionally
perched
on
a
gothic
sofa
with
which
it
was
clearly
impossible
to
establish
any
closer
relations
concluded
that
had
fenno
needed
another
seat
of
the
same
size
she
would
have
set
out
placidly
to
match
the
one
on
which
her
visitor
now
languished
to
quentin

imparted
in
a
clear
young
voice
from
the
opposite
angle
of
the
gothic
sofa
partook
of
the
character
of
their
surroundings
the
girl
mind
was
like
a
large
light
empty
place
scantily
furnished
with
a
few
massive
prejudices
not
designed
to
add
to
any
one
comfort
but
too
ponderous
to
be
easily
moved
quentin
own
intelligence
in
which
its
owner
in
an
artistically
shaded
had
so
long
moved
amid
a
delicate
complexity
of
sensations
seemed
in
comparison
suddenly
close
and
crowded
and
in
taking
refuge
there
from
the
glare
of
the
young
girl
candor
the
older
woman
found
herself
stumbling
in
an
unwonted
obscurity
her
uneasiness
resolved
itself
into
a
sense
of
irritation
against
her
listener
quentin
knew
that
the
momentary
value
of
any
argument
lies
in
the
capacity
of
the
mind
to
which
it
is
addressed
and
as
her
shafts
of
persuasion
spent
themselves
against
miss
obduracy
she
said
to
herself
that
since
conduct
is
governed
by
emotions
rather
than
ideas
the
really
strong
people
are
those
who
mistake
their
sensations
for
opinions
viewed
in
this
light
miss
fenno
was
certainly
very
strong
there
was
an
unmistakable
ring
of
finality
in
the
tone
with
which
she
declared
it
impossible
quentin
answer
veiled
the
least
shade
of
feminine
resentment
i
told
alan
that
where
he
had
failed
there
was
no
chance
of
my
making
an
impression
hope
fenno
laid
on
her
visitor
an
almost
reverential
hand
dear
quentin
it
the
impression
you
make
that
confirms
the
impossibility
quentin
waited
a
moment
she
was
perfectly
aware
that
where
her
feelings
were
concerned
her
sense
of
humor
was
not
to
be
relied
on
do
i
make
such
an
odious
impression
she
asked
at
length
with
a
smile
that
seemed
to
give
the
girl
her
choice
of
two
meanings
you
make
such
a
beautiful
one
it
too
beautiful
it
obscures
my
judgment
quentin
looked
at
her
thoughtfully
would
it
be
permissible
i
wonder
for
an
older
woman
to
suggest
that
at
your
age
it
always
a
misfortune
to
have
what
one
calls
one
judgment
temporarily
obscured
miss

i
try
not
to
judge
others
you
judge
alan
ah
is
not
others
she
murmured
with
an
accent
that
touched
the
older
woman
you
judge
his
mother
i
do
i
do
quentin
pressed
her
point
you
judge
yourself
then
as
you
would
be
in
my
position
and
your
verdict
condemns
me
how
can
you
think
it
it
because
i
appreciate
the
difference
in
our
point
of
view
that
i
find
it
so
difficult
to
defend
myself
against
what
the
temptation
to
imagine
that
i
might
be
as
are
feeling
as
i
do
quentin
rose
with
a
sigh
my
child
in
my
day
love
was
less
subtle
she
added
after
a
moment
alan

a
perfect

ah
that
again
that
makes
it
worse
worse
just
as
your
goodness
does
your
sweetness
your
immense
indulgence
in
letting
me
discuss
things
with
you
in
a
way
that
must
seem
almost
an
impertinence
quentin
smile
was
not
without
irony
you
must
remember
that
i
do
it
for
alan
that
what
i
love
you
for

instantly
returned
and
again
her
tone
touched
her
listener
and
yet
you
sacrificing
him
and
to
an
idea
is
it
to
ideas
that
all
the
sacrifices
that
were
worth

have
been
made

that
what

said
gently
quentin
took
her
hand
i

you
are
she
answered
and
it
is
true
that
i
speak
only
for
alan
perhaps
i
did
when
i
began
but
now
i
want
to
plead
for
you
too
against
yourself
she
paused
and
then
went
on
with
a
deeper
note
i
have
let
you
as
you
say
speak
your
mind
to
me
in
terms
that
some
women
might
have
resented
because
i
wanted
to
show
you
how
little
as
the
years
go
on
theories
ideas
abstract
conceptions
of
life
weigh
against
the
actual
against
the
particular
way
in
which
life
presents
itself
to
us
to
women
especially
to
decide
beforehand
exactly
how
one
ought
to
behave
in
given
circumstances
is
like
deciding
that
one
will
follow
a
certain
direction
in
crossing
an
unexplored
country

we
find
that
we
must
turn
out
for
the
obstacles

rivers

shallowest

the
tracks
that
others
have
beaten
make
all
sorts
of
unexpected
concessions
life
is
made
up
of
compromises
that
is
what
youth
refuses
to
understand
i
lived
long
enough
to
doubt
whether
any
real
good
ever
came
of
sacrificing
beautiful
facts
to
even
more
beautiful
theories
do
i
seem
casuistical
i
do
know
there
may
be
losses
either
way
but
the
love
of
the
man

of
the
child
one

that
makes
up
for
everything
she
had
spoken
with
a
thrill
which
seemed
to
communicate
itself
to
the
hand
her
listener
had
left
in
hers
her
eyes
filled
suddenly
but
through
their
dimness
she
saw
the
girl

shape
a
last
desperate
denial

you
see
it
because
i

all

iii
quentin
in
the
late
spring
afternoon
had
turned
in
at
the
doors
of
the
metropolitan
museum
she
had
been
walking
in
the
park
in
a
solitude
oppressed
by
the
sense
of
her
son
trouble
and
had
suddenly
remembered
that
some
one
had
added
a
beltraffio
to
the
collection
it
was
an
old
habit
of
quentin
to
seek
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
beautiful
the
distraction
that
most
of
her
acquaintances
appeared
to
find
in
each
other
company
she
had
few
friends
and
their
society
was
welcome
to
her
only
in
her
more
superficial
moods
but
she
could
drug
anxiety
with
a
picture
as
some
women
can
soothe
it
with
a
bonnet
during
the
six
months
that
had
elapsed
since
her
visit
to
miss
fenno
she
had
been
conscious
of
a
pain
of
which
she
had
supposed
herself
no
longer
capable
as
a
man
will
continue
to
feel
the
ache
of
an
amputated
arm
she
had
fancied
that
all
her
centres
of
feeling
had
been
transferred
to
alan
but
she
now
found
herself
subject
to
a
kind
of
dual
suffering
in
which
her
individual
pang
was
the
keener
in
that
it
divided
her
from
her
son
alan
had
surprised
her
she
had
not
foreseen
that
he
would
take
a
sentimental
rebuff
so
hard
his
disappointment
took
the
uncommunicative
form
of
a
sterner
application
to
work
he
threw
himself
into
the
concerns
of
the
with
an
aggressiveness
that
almost
betrayed
itself
in
the
paper
quentin
never
read
the
but
from
the
glimpses
of
it
reflected
in
the
other
journals
she
gathered
that
it
was
at
least
not
being
subjected
to
the
moral
reconstruction
which
had
been
one
of
miss
alternatives
quentin
never
spoke
to
her
son
of
what
had
happened
she
was
superior
to
the
cheap
satisfaction
of
avenging
his
injury
by
depreciating
its
cause
she
knew
that
in
sentimental
sorrows
such
consolations
are
as
salt
in
the
wound
the
avoidance
of
a
subject
so
vividly
present
to
both
could
not
but
affect
the
closeness
of
their
relation
an
invisible
presence
hampered
their
liberty
of
speech
and
thought
the
girl
was
always
between
them
and
to
hide
the
sense
of
her
intrusion
they
began
to
be
less
frequently
together
it
was
then
that
quentin
measured
the
extent
of
her
isolation
had
she
ever
dared
to
forecast
such
a
situation
she
would
have
proceeded
on
the
conventional
theory
that
her
son
suffering
must
draw
her
nearer
to
him
and
this
was
precisely
the
relief
that
was
denied
her
uncommunicativeness
extended
below
the
level
of
speech
and
his
mother
reduced
to
the
helplessness
of
had
not
even
the
solace
of
adapting
her
sympathy
to
his
needs
she
did
not
know
what
he
felt
his
course
was
incalculable
to
her
she
sometimes
wondered
if
she
had
become
as
incomprehensible
to
him
and
it
was
to
find
a
moment
refuge
from
the
dogging
misery
of
such
conjectures
that
she
had
now
turned
in
at
the
museum
the
long
line
of
mellow
canvases
seemed
to
receive
her
into
the
rich
calm
of
an
autumn
twilight
she
might
have
been
walking
in
an
enchanted
wood
where
the
footfall
of
care
never
sounded
so
deep
was
the
sense
of
seclusion
that
as
she
turned
from
her
prolonged
communion
with
the
new
beltraffio
it
was
a
surprise
to
find
she
was
not
alone
a
young
lady
who
had
risen
from
the
central
ottoman
stood
in
suspended
flight
as
quentin
faced
her
the
older
woman
was
the
first
to
regain
her
miss
fenno
she
said
the
girl
advanced
with
a
blush
as
it
faded
quentin
noticed
a
change
in
her
there
had
always
been
something
bright
and
bannerlike
in
her
aspect
but
now
her
look
drooped
and
she
hung
at
as
it
were
quentin
in
the
embarrassment
of
surprising
a
secret
that
its
possessor
was
doubtless
unconscious
of
betraying
reverted
hurriedly
to
the
beltraffio
i
came
to
see
this
she
said
it
very
beautiful
miss
fenno
eye
travelled
incuriously
over
the
mystic
blue
reaches
of
the
landscape
i
suppose
so
she
assented
adding
after
another
tentative
pause
you
come
here
often
do
you
very
often
quentin
answered
i
find
pictures
a
great
help
a
help
a
rest
i
mean
if
one
is
tired
or
out
of
sorts
ah
miss
fenno
murmured
looking
down
this
beltraffio
is
new
you
know
quentin
continued
what
a
wonderful
background
is
it
is
he
a
painter
who
interests
you
the
girl
glanced
again
at
the
dusky
canvas
as
though
in
a
final
endeavor
to
extract
from
it
a
clue
to
the
consolations
of
art
i
know
she
said
at
length
i
afraid
i
do
understand
pictures
she
moved
nearer
to
quentin
and
held
out
her
hand
you
going
yes
quentin
looked
at
her
let
me
drive
you
home
she
said
impulsively
she
was
feeling
with
a
shock
of
surprise
that
it
gave
her
after
all
no
pleasure
to
see
how
much
the
girl
had
suffered
miss
fenno
stiffened
perceptibly
thank
you
i
shall
like
the
walk
quentin
dropped
her
hand
with
a
corresponding
movement
of
withdrawal
and
a
momentary
wave
of
antagonism
seemed
to
sweep
the
two
women
apart
then
as
quentin
bowing
slightly
again
addressed
herself
to
the
picture
she
felt
a
sudden
touch
on
her
arm
quentin
the
girl
faltered
i
really
came
here
because
i
saw
your
carriage
her
eyes
sank
and
then
fluttered
back
to
her
face
i
been
horribly
unhappy
she
exclaimed
quentin
was
silent
if
hope
fenno
had
expected
an
immediate
response
to
her
appeal
she
was
disappointed
the
older
woman
face
was
like
a
veil
dropped
before
her
thoughts
i
thought
so
often
the
girl
went
on
precipitately
of
what
you
said
that
day
you
came
to
see
me
last
autumn
i
think
i
understand
now
what
you
meant
what
you
tried
to
make
me
see
oh
quentin
she
broke
out
i
did
mean
to
tell
you
this
i
never
dreamed
of
it
till
this
moment
but
you
remember
what
you
said
do
you
you
must
remember
it
and
now
that
i
met
you
in
this
way
i
ca
help
telling
you
that
i
believe
i
begin
to
believe
that
you
were
right
after
all
quentin
had
listened
without
moving
but
now
she
raised
her
eyes
with
a
slight
smile
do
you
wish
me
to
say
this
to
alan
she
asked
the
girl
flushed
but
her
glance
braved
the
smile
would
he
still
care
to
hear
it
she
said
fearlessly
quentin
took
momentary
refuge
in
a
renewed
inspection
of
the
beltraffio
then
turning
she
said
with
a
kind
of
reluctance
he
would
still
care
ah
broke
from
the
girl
during
this
exchange
of
words
the
two
speakers
had
drifted
unconsciously
toward
one
of
the
benches
quentin
glanced
about
her
a
custodian
who
had
been
hovering
in
the
doorway
sauntered
into
the
adjoining
gallery
and
they
remained
alone
among
the
silvery
vandykes
and
flushed
bituminous
halses
quentin
sank
down
on
the
bench
and
reached
a
hand
to
the
girl
sit
by
me
she
said
miss
fenno
dropped
beside
her
in
both
women
the
stress
of
emotion
was
too
strong
for
speech
the
girl
was
still
trembling
and
quentin
was
the
first
to
regain
her
composure
you
say
you
suffered
she
began
at
last
do
you
suppose
have
i
knew
you
had
that
made
it
so
much
worse
for
me
that
i
should
have
been
the
cause
of
your
suffering
for
alan
quentin
drew
a
deep
breath
not
for
alan
only
she
said
miss
fenno
turned
on
her
a
wondering
glance
not
for
alan
only
pain
every
woman
expects
and
knows
how
to
bear
we
all
know
our
children
must
have
such
disappointments
and
to
suffer
with
them
is
not
the
deepest
pain
it
the
suffering
apart
in
ways
they
do
understand
she
breathed
deeply
i
want
you
to
know
what
i
mean
you
were
right
that
day
and
i
was
wrong
oh
the
girl
faltered
quentin
went
on
in
a
voice
of
passionate
lucidity
i
knew
it
then
i
knew
it
even
while
i
was
trying
to
argue
with
you
i
always
known
it
i
did
want
my
son
to
marry
you
till
i
heard
your
reasons
for
refusing
him
and
then
then
i
longed
to
see
you
his
wife
oh
mrs
quentin
i
longed
for
it
but
i
knew
it
must
be
must
be
quentin
shook
her
head
sadly
and
the
girl
gaining
courage
from
this
mute
negation
cried
with
an
uncontrollable
escape
of
feeling
it
because
you
thought
me
hard
obstinate
oh
i
understand
that
so
well
my
must
have
seemed
so
petty
a
girl
who
could
sacrifice
a
man
future
to
her
own
moral
vanity
for
it
a
form
of
vanity
you
showed
me
that
plainly
enough
how
you
must
have
despised
me
but
i
am
not
that
girl
now
indeed
i
not
i
not
impulsive
i
think
things
out
thought
this
out
i
know
alan
loves
me
i
know
he
loves
me
and
i
believe
i
can
help
him
oh
not
in
the
ways
i
had
fancied
before
but
just
merely
by
loving
him
she
paused
but
quentin
made
no
sign
i
see
it
all
so
differently
now
i
see
what
an
influence
love
itself
may
be
how
my
believing
in
him
loving
him
accepting
him
just
as
he
is
might
help
him
more
than
any
theories
any
arguments
i
might
have
seen
this
long
ago
in
looking
at
as
he
often
told
me
in
seeing
how
you
kept
yourself
apart
from
from
quentin
work
and
his
been
always
the
beautiful
side
of
life
to
them
kept
their
faith
alive
in
spite
of
themselves
not
by
interfering
preaching
reforming
but
by
just
loving
them
and
being
there
she
looked
at
quentin
with
a
simple
nobleness
it
is
as
if
i
cared
for
the
money
you
know
if
i
cared
for
that
i
should
be
afraid
you
will
care
for
it
in
time
quentin
said
suddenly
miss
fenno
drew
back
releasing
her
hand
in
time
yes
when
there
nothing
else
left
she
stared
a
moment
at
the
pictures
my
poor
child
she
broke
out
i
heard
all
you
say
so
often
before
you
heard
it
yes
from
myself
i
felt
as
you
do
i
argued
as
you
do
i
acted
as
i
mean
to
prevent
your
doing
when
i
married
alan
father
the
long
empty
gallery
seemed
to
reverberate
with
the
girl
startled
exclamation
oh
quentin
hush
let
me
speak
do
you
suppose
i
do
this
if
you
were
the
kind
of
idiot
he
ought
to
have
married
it
because
i
see
you
alive
as
i
was
tingling
with
beliefs
ambitions
energies
as
i
was
that
i
ca
see
you
walled
up
alive
as
i
was
without
stretching
out
a
hand
to
save
you
she
sat
gazing
rigidly
forward
her
eyes
on
the
pictures
speaking
in
the
low
precipitate
tone
of
one
who
tries
to
press
the
meaning
of
a
lifetime
into
a
few
breathless
sentences
when
i
met
alan
father
she
went
on
i
knew
nothing
of
his
his
work
we
met
abroad
where
i
had
been
living
with
my
mother
that
was
years
ago
when
the
was
less
less
notorious
than
it
is
now
i
knew
my
husband
owned
a
newspaper
a
great
newspaper
and
nothing
more
i
had
never
seen
a
copy
of
the
i
had
no
notion
what
it
stood
for
in
politics
or
in
other
ways
we
were
married
in
europe
and
a
few
months
afterward
we
came
to
live
here
people
were
already
beginning
to
talk
about
the
my
husband
on
leaving
college
had
bought
it
with
some
money
an
old
uncle
had
left
him
and
the
public
at
first
was
merely
curious
to
see
what
an
ambitious
stirring
young
man
without
any
experience
of
journalism
was
going
to
make
out
of
his
experiment
they
found
first
of
all
that
he
was
going
to
make
a
great
deal
of
money
out
of
it
i
found
that
out
too
i
was
so
happy
in
other
ways
that
it
did
make
much
difference
at
first
though
it
was
pleasant
to
be
able
to
help
my
mother
to
be
generous
and
charitable
to
live
in
a
nice
house
and
wear
the
handsome
gowns
he
liked
to
see
me
in
but
still
it
did
really
count
it
counted
so
little
that
when
one
day
i
learned
what
the
was
i
would
have
gone
out
into
the
streets
barefooted
rather
than
live
another
hour
on
the
money
it
brought
in
her
voice
sank
and
she
paused
to
steady
it
the
girl
at
her
side
did
not
speak
or
move
i
shall
never
forget
that
day
she
began
again
the
paper
had
stripped
bare
some
family
scandal
some
miserable
bleeding
secret
that
a
dozen
unhappy
people
had
been
struggling
to
keep
out
of
print
that
have
been
kept
out
if
my
husband
had
not
oh
you
must
guess
the
rest
i
ca
go
on
she
felt
a
hand
on
hers
you
must
go
on
quentin
the
girl
whispered
yes
i
must
i
must
you
must
be
made
to
understand
she
drew
a
deep
breath
my
husband
was
not
like
alan
when
he
found
out
how
i
felt
about
it
he
was
surprised
at
first
but
gradually
he
began
to
see
or
at
least
i
fancied
he
saw
the
hatefulness
of
it
at
any
rate
he
saw
how
i
suffered
and
he
offered
to
give
up
the
whole
thing
to
sell
the
paper
it
could
be
done
all
of
a
sudden
of
course
he
made
me
see
that
for
he
had
put
all
his
money
in
it
and
he
had
no
special
aptitude
for
any
other
kind
of
work
he
was
a
born
journalist
like
alan
it
was
a
great
sacrifice
for
him
to
give
up
the
paper
but
he
promised
to
do
it
in
time
when
a
good
opportunity
offered
meanwhile
of
course
he
wanted
to
build
it
up
to
increase
the
circulation
and
to
do
that
he
had
to
keep
on
in
the
same
way
he
made
that
clear
to
me
i
saw
that
we
were
in
a
vicious
circle
the
paper
to
sell
well
had
to
be
made
more
and
more
detestable
and
disgraceful
at
first
i
rebelled
but
somehow
i
ca
tell
you
how
it
was
after
that
first
concession
the
ground
seemed
to
give
under
me
with
every
struggle
i
sank
deeper
and
then
then
alan
was
born
he
was
such
a
delicate
baby
that
there
was
very
little
hope
of
saving
him
but
money
did
it
the
money
from
the
paper
i
took
him
abroad
to
see
the
best
physicians
i
took
him
to
a
warm
climate
every
winter
in
hot
weather
the
doctors
recommended
sea
air
and
we
had
a
yacht
and
cruised
every
summer
i
owed
his
life
to
the
and
when
he
began
to
grow
stronger
the
habit
was
formed
the
habit
of
luxury
he
could
not
get
on
without
the
things
he
had
always
been
used
to
he
pined
in
bad
air
he
drooped
under
monotony
and
discomfort
he
throve
on
variety
amusement
travel
every
kind
of
novelty
and
excitement
and
all
i
wanted
for
him
his
inexhaustible
was
there
to
give
my
husband
said
nothing
but
he
must
have
seen
how
things
were
going
there
was
no
more
talk
of
giving
up
the
he
never
reproached
me
with
my
inconsistency
but
i
thought
he
must
despise
me
and
the
thought
made
me
reckless
i
determined
to
ignore
the
paper
altogether
to
take
what
it
gave
as
though
i
did
know
where
it
came
from
and
to
excuse
this
i
invented
the
theory
that
one
may
so
to
speak
purify
money
by
putting
it
to
good
uses
i
gave
away
a
great
deal
in
charity
i
indulged
myself
very
little
at
first
all
the
money
that
was
not
spent
on
alan
i
tried
to
do
good
with
but
gradually
as
my
boy
grew
up
the
problem
became
more
complicated
how
was
i
to
protect
alan
from
the
contamination
i
had
let
him
live
in
i
preach
by
example
could
hold
up
his
father
as
a
warning
or
denounce
the
money
we
were
living
on
all
i
could
do
was
to
disguise
the
inner
ugliness
of
life
by
making
it
beautiful
outside
to
build
a
wall
of
beauty
between
him
and
the
facts
of
life
turn
his
tastes
and
interests
another
way
hide
the
from
him
as
a
smiling
woman
at
a
ball
may
hide
a
cancer
in
her
breast
just
as
alan
was
entering
college
his
father
died
then
i
saw
my
way
clear
i
had
loved
my
husband
and
yet
i
drew
my
first
free
breath
in
years
for
the
had
been
left
to
alan
outright
there
was
nothing
on
earth
to
prevent
his
selling
it
when
he
came
of
age
and
there
was
no
excuse
for
his
not
selling
it
i
had
brought
him
up
to
depend
on
money
but
the
paper
had
given
us
enough
money
to
gratify
all
his
tastes
at
last
we
could
turn
on
the
monster
that
had
nourished
us
i
felt
a
savage
joy
in
the
thought
i
could
hardly
bear
to
wait
till
alan
came
of
age
but
i
had
never
spoken
to
him
of
the
paper
and
i
did
dare
speak
of
it
now
some
false
shame
kept
me
back
some
vague
belief
in
his
ignorance
i
would
wait
till
he
was
and
then
we
should
be
free
i
waited
the
day
came
and
i
spoke
you
can
guess
his
answer
i
suppose
he
had
no
idea
of
selling
the
it
was
the
money
he
cared
for
it
was
the
career
that
tempted
him
he
was
a
born
journalist
and
his
ambition
ever
since
he
could
remember
had
been
to
carry
on
his
father
work
to
develop
to
surpass
it
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
as
interesting
as
modern
journalism
he
imagine
any
other
kind
of
life
that
would
bore
him
to
death
a
newspaper
like
the
might
be
made
one
of
the
biggest
powers
on
earth
and
he
loved
power
and
meant
to
have
all
he
could
get
i
listened
to
him
in
a
kind
of
trance
i
could
find
a
word
to
say
his
father
had
had
scruples
he
had
none
i
seemed
to
realize
at
once
that
argument
would
be
useless
i
do
know
that
i
even
tried
to
plead
with
him
he
was
so
bright
and
hard
and
inaccessible
then
i
saw
that
he
was
after
all
what
i
had
made
him
the
creature
of
my
concessions
my
connivances
my
evasions
that
was
the
price
i
had
paid
for
him
i
had
kept
him
at
that
cost
well
i
kept
him
at
any
rate
that
was
the
feeling
that
survived
he
was
my
boy
my
son
my
very
own
till
some
other
woman
took
him
meanwhile
the
old
life
must
go
on
as
it
could
i
gave
up
the
struggle
if
at
that
point
he
was
inaccessible
at
others
he
was
close
to
me
he
has
always
been
a
perfect
son
our
tastes
grew
together
we
enjoyed
the
same
books
the
same
pictures
the
same
people
all
i
had
to
do
was
to
look
at
him
in
profile
to
see
the
side
of
him
that
was
really
mine
at
first
i
kept
thinking
of
the
dreadful
other
side
but
gradually
the
impression
faded
and
i
kept
my
mind
turned
from
it
as
one
does
from
a
deformity
in
a
face
one
loves
i
thought
i
had
made
my
last
compromise
with
life
had
hit
on
a
that
would
last
my
time
and
then
he
met
you
i
had
always
been
prepared
for
his
marrying
but
not
a
girl
like
you
i
thought
he
would
choose
a
sweet
thing
who
would
never
pry
into
his
closets
he
hated
women
with
ideas
but
as
soon
as
i
saw
you
i
knew
the
struggle
would
have
to
begin
again
he
is
so
much
stronger
than
his
father
he
is
full
of
the
most
monstrous
convictions
and
he
has
the
courage
of
them
too
you
saw
last
year
that
his
love
for
you
never
made
him
waver
he
believes
in
his
work
he
adores
it
it
is
a
kind
of
hideous
idol
to
which
he
would
make
human
sacrifices
he
loves
you
still
i
been
honest
with
you
but
his
love
change
him
it
is
you
who
would
have
to
change
to
die
gradually
as
i
have
died
till
there
is
only
one
live
point
left
in
me
ah
if
one
died
completely
that
simple
enough
but
something
persists
remember
that
a
single
point
an
aching
nerve
of
truth
now
and
then
you
may
drug
it
but
a
touch
wakes
it
again
as
your
face
has
waked
it
in
me
there
always
enough
of
one
old
self
left
to
suffer
with
she
stood
up
and
faced
the
girl
abruptly
what
shall
i
tell
alan
she
said
miss
fenno
sat
motionless
her
eyes
on
the
ground
twilight
was
falling
on
the
gallery
a
twilight
which
seemed
to
emanate
not
so
much
from
the
glass
dome
overhead
as
from
the
crepuscular
depths
into
which
the
faces
of
the
pictures
were
receding
the
custodian
step
sounded
warningly
down
the
corridor
when
the
girl
looked
up
she
was
alone
a
venetian
night
entertainment
i
this
is
the
story
that
in
the
of
the
old
beacon
street
house
now
the
aldebaran
club
judge
anthony
bracknell
of
the
famous
east
india
firm
of
bracknell
saulsbee
when
the
ladies
had
withdrawn
to
the
oval
parlour
and
maria
harp
was
throwing
its
gauzy
web
of
sound
across
the
common
used
to
relate
to
his
grandsons
about
the
year
that
buonaparte
marched
upon
moscow
i
him
venice
said
the
lascar
with
the
big
earrings
and
tony
bracknell
leaning
on
the
high
gunwale
of
his
father
east
indiaman
the
hepzibah
saw
far
off
across
the
morning
sea
a
faint
vision
of
towers
and
domes
dissolved
in
golden
air
it
was
a
rare
february
day
of
the
year
and
a
young
tony
newly
of
age
and
bound
on
the
grand
tour
aboard
the
crack
merchantman
of
old
bracknell
fleet
felt
his
heart
leap
up
as
the
distant
city
trembled
into
shape
the
name
since
childhood
had
been
a
wand
to
him
in
the
hall
of
the
old
bracknell
house
at
salem
there
hung
a
series
of
yellowing
prints
which
uncle
richard
saulsbee
had
brought
home
from
one
of
his
long
voyages
views
of
heathen
mosques
and
palaces
of
the
grand
turk
seraglio
of
peter
church
in
rome
and
in
a
corner
the
corner
nearest
the
rack
where
the
old
flintlocks
hung
a
busy
merry
populous
scene
entitled
mark
square
in
this
picture
from
the
first
had
singularly
taken
little
tony
fancy
his
unformulated
criticism
on
the
others
was
that
they
lacked
action
true
in
the
view
of
peter
an
gentleman
in
a
wig
was
pointing
out
the
fairly
obvious
monument
to
a
bashful
companion
who
had
presumably
not
ventured
to
raise
his
eyes
to
it
while
at
the
doors
of
the
seraglio
a
group
of
turbaned
infidels
observed
with
less
hesitancy
the
approach
of
a
veiled
lady
on
a
camel
but
in
venice
so
many
things
were
happening
at
once
more
tony
was
sure
than
had
ever
happened
in
boston
in
a
or
in
salem
in
a
long
lifetime
for
here
by
their
garb
were
people
of
every
nation
on
earth
chinamen
turks
spaniards
and
many
more
mixed
with
a
throng
of
gentry
lacqueys
chapmen
hucksters
and
tall
personages
in
parsons
gowns
who
stalked
through
the
crowd
with
an
air
of
mastery
a
string
of
parasites
at
their
heels
and
all
these
people
seemed
to
be
diverting
themselves
hugely
chaffering
with
the
hucksters
watching
the
antics
of
trained
dogs
and
monkeys
distributing
doles
to
maimed
beggars
or
having
their
pockets
picked
by
fellows
in
black
the
whole
with
such
an
air
of
ease
and
that
one
felt
the
to
be
as
much
a
part
of
the
show
as
the
tumbling
acrobats
and
animals
as
tony
advanced
in
years
and
experience
this
childish
mumming
lost
its
magic
but
not
so
the
early
imaginings
it
had
excited
for
the
old
picture
had
been
but
the
of
fancy
the
first
step
of
a
leading
to
a
land
of
dreams
with
these
dreams
the
name
of
venice
remained
associated
and
all
that
observation
or
report
subsequently
brought
him
concerning
the
place
seemed
on
a
sober
warranty
of
fact
to
confirm
its
claim
to
stand
midway
between
reality
and
illusion
there
was
for
instance
a
slender
venice
glass
as
with
or
the
dust
of
sunbeams
that
standing
in
the
corner
cabinet
betwixt
two
lowestoft
caddies
seemed
among
its
lifeless
neighbours
to
palpitate
like
an
impaled
butterfly
there
was
farther
a
gold
chain
of
his
mother
spun
of
that
same
so
impalpable
that
it
slipped
through
the
fingers
like
light
yet
so
strong
that
it
carried
a
heavy
pendant
which
seemed
held
in
air
as
if
by
magic
that
was
the
word
which
the
thought
of
venice
evoked
it
was
the
kind
of
place
tony
felt
in
which
things
elsewhere
impossible
might
naturally
happen
in
which
two
and
two
might
make
five
a
paradox
elope
with
a
syllogism
and
a
conclusion
give
the
lie
to
its
own
premiss
was
there
ever
a
young
heart
that
did
not
once
and
again
long
to
get
away
into
such
a
world
as
that
tony
at
least
had
felt
the
longing
from
the
first
hour
when
the
axioms
in
his
had
brought
home
to
him
his
heavy
responsibilities
as
a
christian
and
a
sinner
and
now
here
was
his
wish
taking
shape
before
him
as
the
distant
haze
of
gold
shaped
itself
into
towers
and
domes
across
the
morning
sea
the
reverend
ozias
mounce
tony
governor
and
was
just
putting
a
hand
to
the
third
clause
of
the
fourth
part
of
a
sermon
on
and
predestination
as
the
hepzibah
b
anchor
rattled
overboard
tony
in
his
haste
to
be
ashore
would
have
made
one
plunge
with
the
anchor
but
the
reverend
ozias
on
being
roused
from
his
lucubrations
earnestly
protested
against
leaving
his
argument
in
suspense
what
was
the
trifle
of
an
arrival
at
some
papistical
foreign
city
where
the
very
churches
wore
turbans
like
so
many
moslem
idolators
to
the
important
fact
of
mounce
summing
up
his
conclusions
before
the
muse
of
theology
took
flight
he
should
be
happy
he
said
if
the
tide
served
to
visit
venice
with
bracknell
the
next
morning
the
next
morning
ha
tony
murmured
a
submissive
yes
sir
winked
at
the
subjugated
captain
buckled
on
his
sword
pressed
his
hat
down
with
a
flourish
and
before
the
reverend
ozias
had
arrived
at
his
next
deduction
was
skimming
merrily
shoreward
in
the
hepzibah
gig
a
moment
more
and
he
was
in
the
thick
of
it
here
was
the
very
world
of
the
old
print
only
suffused
with
sunlight
and
colour
and
bubbling
with
merry
noises
what
a
scene
it
was
a
square
enclosed
in
fantastic
painted
buildings
and
peopled
with
a
throng
as
fantastic
a
bawling
laughing
jostling
sweating
mob
crackling
and
sputtering
under
the
hot
sun
like
a
dish
of
fritters
over
a
kitchen
fire
tony
agape
shouldered
his
way
through
the
press
aware
at
once
that
spite
of
the
tumult
the
shrillness
the
gesticulation
there
was
no
undercurrent
of
clownishness
no
tendency
to
as
in
such
crowds
on
at
home
but
a
kind
of
facetious
suavity
which
seemed
to
include
everybody
in
the
circumference
of
one
huge
joke
in
such
an
air
the
sense
of
strangeness
soon
wore
off
and
tony
was
beginning
to
feel
himself
vastly
at
home
when
a
lift
of
the
tide
bore
him
against
a
fellow
who
carried
above
his
head
a
tall
metal
tree
hung
with
the
encounter
set
the
glasses
spinning
and
three
or
four
spun
off
and
clattered
to
the
stones
the
called
on
all
the
saints
and
tony
clapping
a
lordly
hand
to
his
pocket
tossed
him
a
ducat
by
mistake
for
a
sequin
the
fellow
eyes
shot
out
of
their
orbits
and
just
then
a
young
man
who
had
observed
the
transaction
stepped
up
to
tony
and
said
pleasantly
in
english
i
perceive
sir
that
you
are
not
familiar
with
our
currency
does
he
want
more
says
tony
very
lordly
whereat
the
other
laughed
and
replied
you
have
given
him
enough
to
retire
from
his
business
and
open
a
over
the
arcade
tony
joined
in
the
laugh
and
this
incident
bridging
the
preliminaries
the
two
young
men
were
presently
hobnobbing
over
a
glass
of
canary
in
front
of
one
of
the
about
the
square
tony
counted
himself
lucky
to
have
run
across
an
companion
who
was
enough
to
give
him
a
clue
to
the
labyrinth
and
when
he
had
paid
for
the
canary
in
the
coin
his
friend
selected
they
set
out
again
to
view
the
town
the
italian
gentleman
who
called
himself
count
rialto
appeared
to
have
a
very
numerous
acquaintance
and
was
able
to
point
out
to
tony
all
the
chief
dignitaries
of
the
state
the
men
of
ton
and
ladies
of
fashion
as
well
as
a
number
of
other
characters
of
a
kind
not
openly
mentioned
in
taking
a
census
of
salem
tony
who
was
not
averse
from
reading
when
nothing
better
offered
had
perused
the
merchant
of
venice
and
otway
fine
tragedy
but
though
these
pieces
had
given
him
a
notion
that
the
social
usages
of
venice
differed
from
those
at
home
he
was
unprepared
for
the
surprising
appearance
and
manners
of
the
great
people
his
friend
named
to
him
the
gravest
senators
of
the
republic
went
in
prodigious
striped
trousers
short
cloaks
and
feathered
hats
one
nobleman
wore
a
ruff
and
doctor
gown
another
a
black
velvet
tunic
slashed
with
while
the
president
of
the
dreaded
council
of
ten
was
a
terrible
strutting
fellow
with
a
nose
a
buff
leather
jerkin
and
a
trailing
scarlet
cloak
that
the
crowd
was
careful
not
to
step
on
it
was
all
vastly
diverting
and
tony
would
gladly
have
gone
on
forever
but
he
had
given
his
word
to
the
captain
to
be
at
the
at
sunset
and
here
was
dusk
already
creeping
over
the
skies
tony
was
a
man
of
honour
and
having
pressed
on
the
count
a
handsome
damascened
dagger
selected
from
one
of
the
goldsmiths
shops
in
a
narrow
street
lined
with
such
wares
he
insisted
on
turning
his
face
toward
the
hepzibah
gig
the
count
yielded
reluctantly
but
as
they
came
out
again
on
the
square
they
were
caught
in
a
great
throng
pouring
toward
the
doors
of
the
cathedral
they
go
to
benediction
said
the
count
a
beautiful
sight
with
many
lights
and
flowers
it
is
a
pity
you
can
not
take
a
peep
at
it
tony
thought
so
too
and
in
another
minute
a
legless
beggar
had
pulled
back
the
leathern
flap
of
the
cathedral
door
and
they
stood
in
a
haze
of
gold
and
perfume
that
seemed
to
rise
and
fall
on
the
mighty
undulations
of
the
organ
here
the
press
was
as
thick
as
without
and
as
tony
flattened
himself
against
a
pillar
he
heard
a
pretty
voice
at
his
elbow
oh
sir
oh
sir
your
sword
he
turned
at
sound
of
the
broken
english
and
saw
a
girl
who
matched
the
voice
trying
to
disengage
her
dress
from
the
tip
of
his
scabbard
she
wore
one
of
the
voluminous
black
hoods
which
the
venetian
ladies
affected
and
under
its
projecting
eaves
her
face
spied
out
at
him
as
sweet
as
a
nesting
bird
in
the
dusk
their
hands
met
over
the
scabbard
and
as
she
freed
herself
a
shred
of
her
lace
flounce
clung
to
tony
enchanted
fingers
looking
after
her
he
saw
she
was
on
the
arm
of
a
graybeard
in
a
long
black
gown
and
scarlet
stockings
who
on
perceiving
the
exchange
of
glances
between
the
young
people
drew
the
lady
away
with
a
threatening
look
the
count
met
tony
eye
with
a
smile
one
of
our
venetian
beauties
said
he
the
lovely
polixena
cador
she
is
thought
to
have
the
finest
eyes
in
venice
she
spoke
english
stammered
tony
oh
ah
precisely
she
learned
the
language
at
the
court
of
saint
james
where
her
father
the
senator
was
formerly
accredited
as
ambassador
she
played
as
an
infant
with
the
royal
princes
of
england
and
that
was
her
father
assuredly
young
ladies
of
donna
polixena
rank
do
not
go
abroad
save
with
their
parents
or
a
duenna
just
then
a
soft
hand
slid
into
tony
his
heart
gave
a
foolish
bound
and
he
turned
about
to
meet
again
the
merry
eyes
under
the
hood
but
saw
instead
a
slender
brown
boy
in
some
kind
of
fanciful
page
dress
who
thrust
a
folded
paper
between
his
fingers
and
vanished
in
the
throng
tony
in
a
tingle
glanced
surreptitiously
at
the
count
who
appeared
absorbed
in
his
prayers
the
crowd
at
the
ringing
of
a
bell
had
in
fact
been
overswept
by
a
sudden
wave
of
devotion
and
tony
seized
the
moment
to
step
beneath
a
lighted
shrine
with
his
letter
i
am
in
dreadful
trouble
and
implore
your
help
polixena
he
read
but
hardly
had
he
seized
the
sense
of
the
words
when
a
hand
fell
on
his
shoulder
and
a
man
in
a
cocked
hat
and
bearing
a
kind
of
rod
or
mace
pronounced
a
few
words
in
venetian
tony
with
a
start
thrust
the
letter
in
his
breast
and
tried
to
jerk
himself
free
but
the
harder
he
jerked
the
tighter
grew
the
grip
and
the
count
presently
perceiving
what
had
happened
pushed
his
way
through
the
crowd
and
whispered
hastily
to
his
companion
for
god
sake
make
no
struggle
this
is
serious
keep
quiet
and
do
as
i
tell
you
tony
was
no
he
had
something
of
a
name
for
pugnacity
among
the
lads
of
his
own
age
at
home
and
was
not
the
man
to
stand
in
venice
what
he
would
have
resented
in
salem
but
the
devil
of
it
was
that
this
black
fellow
seemed
to
be
pointing
to
the
letter
in
his
breast
and
this
suspicion
was
confirmed
by
the
count
agitated
whisper
this
is
one
of
the
agents
of
the
for
god
sake
no
outcry
he
exchanged
a
word
or
two
with
the
and
again
turned
to
tony
you
have
been
seen
concealing
a
letter
about
your
person
and
what
of
that
says
tony
furiously
gently
gently
my
master
a
letter
handed
to
you
by
the
page
of
donna
polixena
a
black
business
oh
a
very
black
business
this
cador
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
nobles
in
venice
i
beseech
you
not
a
word
sir
let
me
think
deliberate
his
hand
on
tony
shoulder
he
carried
on
a
rapid
dialogue
with
the
potentate
in
the
cocked
hat
i
am
sorry
sir
but
our
young
ladies
of
rank
are
as
jealously
guarded
as
the
grand
turk
wives
and
you
must
be
answerable
for
this
scandal
the
best
i
can
do
is
to
have
you
taken
privately
to
the
palazzo
cador
instead
of
being
brought
before
the
council
i
have
pleaded
your
youth
and
inexperience
tony
winced
at
this
and
i
think
the
business
may
still
be
arranged
meanwhile
the
agent
of
the
ten
had
yielded
his
place
to
a
fellow
in
black
dressed
somewhat
like
a
lawyer
clerk
who
laid
a
grimy
hand
on
tony
arm
and
with
many
apologetic
gestures
steered
him
through
the
crowd
to
the
doors
of
the
church
the
count
held
him
by
the
other
arm
and
in
this
fashion
they
emerged
on
the
square
which
now
lay
in
darkness
save
for
the
many
lights
twinkling
under
the
arcade
and
in
the
windows
of
the
above
it
tony
by
this
time
had
regained
voice
enough
to
declare
that
he
would
go
where
they
pleased
but
that
he
must
first
say
a
word
to
the
mate
of
the
hepzibah
who
had
now
been
awaiting
him
some
two
hours
or
more
at
the
the
count
repeated
this
to
tony
custodian
but
the
latter
shook
his
head
and
rattled
off
a
sharp
denial
impossible
sir
said
the
count
i
entreat
you
not
to
insist
any
resistance
will
tell
against
you
in
the
end
tony
fell
silent
with
a
rapid
eye
he
was
measuring
his
chances
of
escape
in
wind
and
limb
he
was
more
than
a
mate
for
his
captors
and
boyhood
ruses
were
not
so
far
behind
him
but
he
felt
himself
equal
to
outwitting
a
dozen
grown
men
but
he
had
the
sense
to
see
that
at
a
cry
the
crowd
would
close
in
on
him
space
was
what
he
wanted
a
clear
ten
yards
and
he
would
have
laughed
at
doge
and
council
but
the
throng
was
thick
as
glue
and
he
walked
on
submissively
keeping
his
eye
alert
for
an
opening
suddenly
the
mob
swerved
aside
after
some
new
show
tony
fist
shot
out
at
the
black
fellow
chest
and
before
the
latter
could
right
himself
the
young
new
englander
was
showing
a
clean
pair
of
heels
to
his
escort
on
he
sped
cleaving
the
crowd
like
a
in
gloucester
bay
diving
under
the
first
arch
that
caught
his
eye
dashing
down
a
lane
to
an
unlit
and
plunging
across
a
narrow
bridge
which
landed
him
in
a
black
pocket
between
walls
but
now
his
pursuers
were
at
his
back
reinforced
by
the
yelping
mob
the
walls
were
too
high
to
scale
and
for
all
his
courage
tony
breath
came
short
as
he
paced
the
masonry
cage
in
which
had
landed
him
suddenly
a
gate
opened
in
one
of
the
walls
and
a
slip
of
a
servant
wench
looked
out
and
beckoned
him
there
was
no
time
to
weigh
chances
tony
dashed
through
the
gate
his
rescuer
slammed
and
bolted
it
and
the
two
stood
in
a
narrow
paved
well
between
high
houses
ii
the
servant
picked
up
a
lantern
and
signed
to
tony
to
follow
her
they
climbed
a
squalid
stairway
of
stone
felt
their
way
along
a
corridor
and
entered
a
tall
vaulted
room
feebly
lit
by
an
hung
from
the
painted
ceiling
tony
discerned
traces
of
former
splendour
in
his
surroundings
but
he
had
no
time
to
examine
them
for
a
figure
started
up
at
his
approach
and
in
the
dim
light
he
recognized
the
girl
who
was
the
cause
of
all
his
troubles
she
sprang
toward
him
with
outstretched
hands
but
as
he
advanced
her
face
changed
and
she
shrank
back
abashed
this
is
a
misunderstanding
a
dreadful
misunderstanding
she
cried
out
in
her
pretty
broken
english
oh
how
does
it
happen
that
you
are
here
through
no
choice
of
my
own
madam
i
assure
you
retorted
tony
not
by
his
reception
but
why
how
how
did
you
make
this
unfortunate
mistake
why
madam
if
you
excuse
my
candour
i
think
the
mistake
was
yours
mine
in
sending
me
a
letter
a
letter
by
a
simpleton
of
a
lad
who
must
needs
hand
it
to
me
under
your
father
very
nose
the
girl
broke
in
on
him
with
a
cry
what
it
was
who
received
my
letter
she
swept
round
on
the
little
and
submerged
her
under
a
flood
of
venetian
the
latter
volleyed
back
in
the
same
jargon
and
as
she
did
so
tony
astonished
eye
detected
in
her
the
doubleted
page
who
had
handed
him
the
letter
in
saint
mark
what
he
cried
the
lad
was
this
girl
in
disguise
polixena
broke
off
with
an
irrepressible
smile
but
her
face
clouded
instantly
and
she
returned
to
the
charge
this
wicked
careless
girl
she
has
ruined
me
she
will
be
my
undoing
oh
sir
how
can
i
make
you
understand
the
letter
was
not
intended
for
you
it
was
meant
for
the
english
ambassador
an
old
friend
of
my
mother
from
whom
i
hoped
to
obtain
assistance
oh
how
can
i
ever
excuse
myself
to
you
no
excuses
are
needed
madam
said
tony
bowing
though
i
am
surprised
i
own
that
any
one
should
mistake
me
for
an
ambassador
here
a
wave
of
mirth
again
overran
polixena
face
oh
sir
you
must
pardon
my
poor
girl
mistake
she
heard
you
speaking
english
and
and
i
had
told
her
to
hand
the
letter
to
the
handsomest
foreigner
in
the
church
tony
bowed
again
more
profoundly
the
english
ambassador
polixena
added
simply
is
a
very
handsome
man
i
wish
madam
i
were
a
better
proxy
she
echoed
his
laugh
and
then
clapped
her
hands
together
with
a
look
of
anguish
fool
that
i
am
how
can
i
jest
at
such
a
moment
i
am
in
dreadful
trouble
and
now
perhaps
i
have
brought
trouble
on
you
also
oh
my
father
i
hear
my
father
coming
she
turned
pale
and
leaned
tremblingly
upon
the
little
servant
footsteps
and
loud
voices
were
in
fact
heard
outside
and
a
moment
later
the
senator
stalked
into
the
room
attended
by
of
the
magnificoes
whom
tony
had
seen
abroad
in
the
square
at
sight
of
him
all
clapped
hands
to
their
swords
and
burst
into
furious
outcries
and
though
their
jargon
was
unintelligible
to
the
young
man
their
tones
and
gestures
made
their
meaning
unpleasantly
plain
the
senator
with
a
start
of
anger
first
flung
himself
on
the
intruder
then
snatched
back
by
his
companions
turned
wrathfully
on
his
daughter
who
at
his
feet
with
outstretched
arms
and
streaming
face
pleaded
her
cause
with
all
the
eloquence
of
young
distress
meanwhile
the
other
nobles
gesticulated
vehemently
among
themselves
and
one
a
personage
in
ruff
and
spanish
cape
stalked
apart
keeping
a
jealous
eye
on
tony
the
latter
was
at
his
wit
end
how
to
comport
himself
for
the
lovely
polixena
tears
had
quite
drowned
her
few
words
of
english
and
beyond
guessing
that
the
magnificoes
meant
him
a
mischief
he
had
no
notion
what
they
would
be
at
at
this
point
luckily
his
friend
count
rialto
suddenly
broke
in
on
the
scene
and
was
at
once
assailed
by
all
the
tongues
in
the
room
he
pulled
a
long
face
at
sight
of
tony
but
signed
to
the
young
man
to
be
silent
and
addressed
himself
earnestly
to
the
senator
the
latter
at
first
would
not
draw
breath
to
hear
him
but
presently
sobering
he
walked
apart
with
the
count
and
the
two
conversed
together
out
of
earshot
my
dear
sir
said
the
count
at
length
turning
to
tony
with
a
perturbed
countenance
it
is
as
i
feared
and
you
are
fallen
into
a
great
misfortune
a
great
misfortune
a
great
trap
i
call
it
shouted
tony
whose
blood
by
this
time
was
boiling
but
as
he
uttered
the
word
the
beautiful
polixena
cast
such
a
stricken
look
on
him
that
he
blushed
up
to
the
forehead
be
careful
said
the
count
in
a
low
tone
though
his
illustriousness
does
not
speak
your
language
he
understands
a
few
words
of
it
and
so
much
the
better
broke
in
tony
i
hope
he
will
understand
me
if
i
ask
him
in
plain
english
what
is
his
grievance
against
me
the
senator
at
this
would
have
burst
forth
again
but
the
count
stepping
between
answered
quickly
his
grievance
against
you
is
that
you
have
been
detected
in
secret
correspondence
with
his
daughter
the
most
noble
polixena
cador
the
betrothed
bride
of
this
gentleman
the
most
illustrious
marquess
zanipolo
and
he
waved
a
deferential
hand
at
the
frowning
hidalgo
of
the
cape
and
ruff
sir
said
tony
if
that
is
the
extent
of
my
offence
it
lies
with
the
young
lady
to
set
me
free
since
by
her
own
avowal
but
here
he
stopped
short
for
to
his
surprise
polixena
shot
a
terrified
glance
at
him
sir
interposed
the
count
we
are
not
accustomed
in
venice
to
take
shelter
behind
a
lady
reputation
no
more
are
we
in
salem
retorted
tony
in
a
white
heat
i
was
merely
about
to
remark
that
by
the
young
lady
avowal
she
has
never
seen
me
before
polixena
eyes
signalled
her
gratitude
and
he
felt
he
would
have
died
to
defend
her
the
count
translated
his
statement
and
presently
pursued
his
illustriousness
observes
that
in
that
case
his
daughter
misconduct
has
been
all
the
more
reprehensible
her
misconduct
of
what
does
he
accuse
her
of
sending
you
just
now
in
the
church
of
saint
mark
a
letter
which
you
were
seen
to
read
openly
and
thrust
in
your
bosom
the
incident
was
witnessed
by
his
illustriousness
the
marquess
zanipolo
who
in
consequence
has
already
repudiated
his
unhappy
bride
tony
stared
contemptuously
at
the
black
marquess
if
his
illustriousness
is
so
lacking
in
gallantry
as
to
repudiate
a
lady
on
so
trivial
a
pretext
it
is
he
and
not
i
who
should
be
the
object
of
her
father
resentment
that
my
dear
young
gentleman
is
hardly
for
you
to
decide
your
only
excuse
being
your
ignorance
of
our
customs
it
is
scarcely
for
you
to
advise
us
how
to
behave
in
matters
of
punctilio
it
seemed
to
tony
as
though
the
count
were
going
over
to
his
enemies
and
the
thought
sharpened
his
retort
i
had
supposed
said
he
that
men
of
sense
had
much
the
same
behaviour
in
all
countries
and
that
here
as
elsewhere
a
gentleman
would
be
taken
at
his
word
i
solemnly
affirm
that
the
letter
i
was
seen
to
read
reflects
in
no
way
on
the
honour
of
this
young
lady
and
has
in
fact
nothing
to
do
with
what
you
suppose
as
he
had
himself
no
notion
what
the
letter
was
about
this
was
as
far
as
he
dared
commit
himself
there
was
another
brief
consultation
in
the
opposing
camp
and
the
count
then
said
we
all
know
sir
that
a
gentleman
is
obliged
to
meet
certain
enquiries
by
a
denial
but
you
have
at
your
command
the
means
of
immediately
clearing
the
lady
will
you
show
the
letter
to
her
father
there
was
a
perceptible
pause
during
which
tony
while
appearing
to
look
straight
before
him
managed
to
deflect
an
interrogatory
glance
toward
polixena
her
reply
was
a
faint
negative
motion
accompanied
by
unmistakable
signs
of
apprehension
poor
girl
he
thought
she
is
in
a
worse
case
than
i
imagined
and
whatever
happens
i
must
keep
her
secret
he
turned
to
the
senator
with
a
deep
bow
i
am
not
said
he
in
the
habit
of
showing
my
private
correspondence
to
strangers
the
count
interpreted
these
words
and
donna
polixena
father
dashing
his
hand
on
his
hilt
broke
into
furious
invective
while
the
marquess
continued
to
nurse
his
outraged
feelings
aloof
the
count
shook
his
head
funereally
alas
sir
it
is
as
i
feared
this
is
not
the
first
time
that
youth
and
propinquity
have
led
to
fatal
imprudence
but
i
need
hardly
i
suppose
point
out
the
obligation
incumbent
upon
you
as
a
man
of
honour
tony
stared
at
him
haughtily
with
a
look
which
was
meant
for
the
marquess
and
what
obligation
is
that
to
repair
the
wrong
you
have
done
in
other
words
to
marry
the
lady
polixena
at
this
burst
into
tears
and
tony
said
to
himself
why
in
heaven
does
she
not
bid
me
show
the
letter
then
he
remembered
that
it
had
no
superscription
and
that
the
words
it
contained
supposing
them
to
have
been
addressed
to
himself
were
hardly
of
a
nature
to
disarm
suspicion
the
sense
of
the
girl
grave
plight
effaced
all
thought
of
his
own
risk
but
the
count
last
words
struck
him
as
so
preposterous
that
he
could
not
repress
a
smile
i
can
not
flatter
myself
said
he
that
the
lady
would
welcome
this
solution
the
count
manner
became
increasingly
ceremonious
such
modesty
he
said
becomes
your
youth
and
inexperience
but
even
if
it
were
justified
it
would
scarcely
alter
the
case
as
it
is
always
assumed
in
this
country
that
a
young
lady
wishes
to
marry
the
man
whom
her
father
has
selected
but
i
understood
just
now
tony
interposed
that
the
gentleman
yonder
was
in
that
enviable
position
so
he
was
till
circumstances
obliged
him
to
waive
the
privilege
in
your
favour
he
does
me
too
much
honour
but
if
a
deep
sense
of
my
unworthiness
obliges
me
to
decline
you
are
still
interrupted
the
count
labouring
under
a
misapprehension
your
choice
in
the
matter
is
no
more
to
be
consulted
than
the
lady
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
on
it
it
is
necessary
that
you
should
marry
her
within
the
hour
tony
at
this
for
all
his
spirit
felt
the
blood
run
thin
in
his
veins
he
looked
in
silence
at
the
threatening
visages
between
himself
and
the
door
stole
a
at
the
high
barred
windows
of
the
apartment
and
then
turned
to
polixena
who
had
fallen
sobbing
at
her
father
feet
and
if
i
refuse
said
he
the
count
made
a
significant
gesture
i
am
not
so
foolish
as
to
threaten
a
man
of
your
mettle
but
perhaps
you
are
unaware
what
the
consequences
would
be
to
the
lady
polixena
at
this
struggling
to
her
feet
addressed
a
few
impassioned
words
to
the
count
and
her
father
but
the
latter
put
her
aside
with
an
obdurate
gesture
the
count
turned
to
tony
the
lady
herself
pleads
for
you
at
what
cost
you
do
not
guess
but
as
you
see
it
is
vain
in
an
hour
his
illustriousness
chaplain
will
be
here
meanwhile
his
illustriousness
consents
to
leave
you
in
the
custody
of
your
betrothed
he
stepped
back
and
the
other
gentlemen
bowing
with
deep
ceremony
to
tony
stalked
out
one
by
one
from
the
room
tony
heard
the
key
turn
in
the
lock
and
found
himself
alone
with
polixena
iii
the
girl
had
sunk
into
a
chair
her
face
hidden
a
picture
of
shame
and
agony
so
moving
was
the
sight
that
tony
once
again
forgot
his
own
extremity
in
the
view
of
her
distress
he
went
and
kneeled
beside
her
drawing
her
hands
from
her
face
oh
do
make
me
look
at
you
she
sobbed
but
it
was
on
his
bosom
that
she
hid
from
his
gaze
he
held
her
there
a
as
he
might
have
clasped
a
weeping
child
then
she
drew
back
and
put
him
gently
from
her
what
humiliation
she
lamented
do
you
think
i
blame
you
for
what
has
happened
alas
was
it
not
my
foolish
letter
that
brought
you
to
this
plight
and
how
nobly
you
defended
me
how
generous
it
was
of
you
not
to
show
the
letter
if
my
father
knew
i
had
written
to
the
ambassador
to
save
me
from
this
dreadful
marriage
his
anger
against
me
would
be
even
greater
ah
it
was
that
you
wrote
for
cried
tony
with
unaccountable
relief
of
course
what
else
did
you
think
but
is
it
too
late
for
the
ambassador
to
save
you
from
a
smile
flashed
through
her
tears
alas
yes
she
drew
back
and
hid
her
face
again
as
though
overcome
by
a
fresh
wave
of
shame
tony
glanced
about
him
if
i
could
wrench
a
bar
out
of
that
window
he
muttered
impossible
the
court
is
guarded
you
are
a
prisoner
oh
i
must
speak
she
sprang
up
and
paced
the
room
but
indeed
you
can
scarce
think
worse
of
me
than
you
do
already
i
think
ill
of
you
alas
you
must
to
be
unwilling
to
marry
the
man
my
father
has
chosen
for
me
such
a
lout
it
would
be
a
burning
shame
if
you
married
him
ah
you
come
from
a
free
country
here
a
girl
is
allowed
no
choice
it
is
infamous
i
say
infamous
no
no
i
ought
to
have
resigned
myself
like
so
many
others
resigned
yourself
to
that
brute
impossible
he
has
a
dreadful
name
for
violence
his
gondolier
has
told
my
little
maid
such
tales
of
him
but
why
do
i
talk
of
myself
when
it
is
of
you
i
should
be
thinking
of
me
poor
child
cried
tony
losing
his
head
yes
and
how
to
save
you
for
i
save
you
but
every
moment
counts
and
yet
what
i
have
to
say
is
so
dreadful
nothing
from
your
lips
could
seem
dreadful
ah
if
he
had
had
your
way
of
speaking
well
now
at
least
you
are
free
of
him
said
tony
a
little
wildly
but
at
this
she
stood
up
and
bent
a
grave
look
on
him
no
i
am
not
free
she
said
but
you
are
if
you
will
do
as
i
tell
you
tony
at
this
felt
a
sudden
dizziness
as
though
from
a
mad
flight
through
clouds
and
darkness
he
had
dropped
to
safety
again
and
the
fall
had
stunned
him
what
am
i
to
do
he
said
look
away
from
me
or
i
can
never
tell
you
he
thought
at
first
that
this
was
a
jest
but
her
eyes
commanded
him
and
reluctantly
he
walked
away
and
leaned
in
the
embrasure
of
the
window
she
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
as
soon
as
his
back
was
turned
she
began
to
speak
in
a
quick
monotonous
voice
as
though
she
were
reciting
a
lesson
you
must
know
that
the
marquess
zanipolo
though
a
great
noble
is
not
a
rich
man
true
he
has
large
estates
but
he
is
a
desperate
spendthrift
and
gambler
and
would
sell
his
soul
for
a
round
sum
of
ready
if
you
turn
round
i
shall
not
go
on
he
wrangled
horribly
with
my
father
over
my
dowry
he
wanted
me
to
have
more
than
either
of
my
sisters
though
one
married
a
procurator
and
the
other
a
grandee
of
spain
but
my
father
is
a
gambler
too
oh
such
fortunes
as
are
squandered
over
the
arcade
yonder
and
so
and
so
do
turn
i
implore
you
oh
do
you
begin
to
see
my
meaning
she
broke
off
sobbing
and
it
took
all
his
strength
to
keep
his
eyes
from
her
go
on
he
said
will
you
not
understand
oh
i
would
say
anything
to
save
you
you
do
know
us
venetians
we
all
to
be
bought
for
a
price
it
is
not
only
the
brides
who
are
marketable
sometimes
the
husbands
sell
themselves
too
and
they
think
you
rich
my
father
does
and
the
others
i
do
know
why
unless
you
have
shown
your
money
too
freely
and
the
english
are
all
rich
are
they
not
and
oh
oh
do
you
understand
oh
i
ca
bear
your
eyes
she
dropped
into
a
chair
her
head
on
her
arms
and
tony
in
a
flash
was
at
her
side
my
poor
child
my
poor
polixena
he
cried
and
wept
and
clasped
her
you
rich
are
you
not
you
would
promise
them
a
ransom
she
persisted
to
enable
you
to
marry
the
marquess
to
enable
you
to
escape
from
this
place
oh
i
hope
i
may
never
see
your
face
again
she
fell
to
weeping
once
more
and
he
drew
away
and
paced
the
floor
in
a
fever
presently
she
sprang
up
with
a
fresh
air
of
resolution
and
pointed
to
a
clock
against
the
wall
the
hour
is
nearly
over
it
is
quite
true
that
my
father
is
gone
to
fetch
his
chaplain
oh
i
implore
you
be
warned
by
me
there
is
no
other
way
of
escape
and
if
i
do
as
you
say
you
are
safe
you
are
free
i
stake
my
life
on
it
and
you
you
are
married
to
that
villain
but
i
shall
have
saved
you
tell
me
your
name
that
i
may
say
it
to
myself
when
i
am
alone
my
name
is
anthony
but
you
must
not
marry
that
fellow
you
forgive
me
anthony
you
do
think
too
badly
of
me
i
say
you
must
not
marry
that
fellow
she
laid
a
trembling
hand
on
his
arm
time
presses
she
adjured
him
and
i
warn
you
there
is
no
other
way
for
a
moment
he
had
a
vision
of
his
mother
sitting
very
upright
on
a
sunday
evening
reading
tillotson
sermons
in
the
best
parlour
at
salem
then
he
swung
round
on
the
girl
and
caught
both
her
hands
in
his
yes
there
is
he
cried
if
you
are
willing
polixena
let
the
priest
come
she
shrank
back
from
him
white
and
radiant
oh
hush
be
silent
she
said
i
am
no
noble
marquess
and
have
no
great
estates
he
cried
my
father
is
a
plain
india
merchant
in
the
colony
of
massachusetts
but
if
you
oh
hush
i
say
i
do
know
what
your
long
words
mean
but
i
bless
you
bless
you
bless
you
on
my
knees
and
she
knelt
before
him
and
fell
to
kissing
his
hands
he
drew
her
up
to
his
breast
and
held
her
there
you
are
willing
polixena
he
said
no
no
she
broke
from
him
with
outstretched
hands
i
am
not
willing
you
mistake
me
i
must
marry
the
marquess
i
tell
you
on
my
money
he
taunted
her
and
her
burning
blush
rebuked
him
yes
on
your
money
she
said
sadly
why
because
much
as
you
hate
him
you
hate
me
still
more
she
was
silent
if
you
hate
me
why
do
you
sacrifice
yourself
for
me
he
persisted
you
torture
me
and
i
tell
you
the
hour
is
past
let
it
pass
i
not
accept
your
sacrifice
i
will
not
lift
a
finger
to
help
another
man
to
marry
you
oh
madman
madman
she
murmured
tony
with
crossed
arms
faced
her
squarely
and
she
leaned
against
the
wall
a
few
feet
off
from
him
her
breast
throbbed
under
its
lace
and
falbalas
and
her
eyes
swam
with
terror
and
entreaty
polixena
i
love
you
he
cried
a
blush
swept
over
her
throat
and
bosom
bathing
her
in
light
to
the
verge
of
her
troubled
brows
i
love
you
i
love
you
he
repeated
and
now
she
was
on
his
breast
again
and
all
their
youth
was
in
their
lips
but
her
embrace
was
as
fleeting
as
a
bird
poise
and
before
he
knew
it
he
clasped
empty
air
and
half
the
room
was
between
them
she
was
holding
up
a
little
coral
charm
and
laughing
i
took
it
from
your
fob
she
said
it
is
of
no
value
is
it
and
i
shall
not
get
any
of
the
money
you
know
she
continued
to
laugh
strangely
and
the
rouge
burned
like
fire
in
her
ashen
face
what
are
you
talking
of
he
said
they
never
give
me
anything
but
the
clothes
i
wear
and
i
shall
never
see
you
again
anthony
she
gave
him
a
dreadful
look
oh
my
poor
boy
my
poor
love
love
you
i
love
you
polixena
he
thought
she
had
turned
and
advanced
to
her
with
soothing
words
but
she
held
him
quietly
at
arm
length
and
as
he
gazed
he
read
the
truth
in
her
face
he
fell
back
from
her
and
a
sob
broke
from
him
as
he
bowed
his
head
on
his
hands
only
for
god
sake
have
the
money
ready
or
there
may
be
foul
play
here
she
said
as
she
spoke
there
was
a
great
tramping
of
steps
outside
and
a
burst
of
voices
on
the
threshold
it
is
all
a
lie
she
gasped
out
about
my
marriage
and
the
marquess
and
the
ambassador
and
the
senator
but
not
oh
not
about
your
danger
in
this
place
or
about
my
love
she
breathed
to
him
and
as
the
key
rattled
in
the
door
she
laid
her
lips
on
his
brow
the
key
rattled
and
the
door
swung
open
but
the
gentleman
who
stepped
in
though
a
priest
indeed
was
no
votary
of
idolatrous
rites
but
that
sound
orthodox
divine
the
reverend
ozias
mounce
looking
very
much
perturbed
at
his
surroundings
and
very
much
on
the
alert
for
the
scarlet
woman
he
was
supported
to
his
evident
relief
by
the
captain
of
the
hepzibah
and
the
procession
was
closed
by
an
escort
of
fellows
in
cocked
hats
and
who
led
between
them
tony
late
friends
the
magnificoes
now
as
sorry
a
looking
company
as
the
law
ever
landed
in
her
net
the
captain
strode
briskly
into
the
room
uttering
a
grunt
of
satisfaction
as
he
clapped
eyes
on
tony
so
bracknell
said
he
you
have
been
seeing
the
carnival
with
this
pack
of
mummers
have
you
and
this
is
where
your
pleasuring
has
landed
you
h
a
pretty
establishment
and
a
pretty
lady
at
the
head
of
it
he
glanced
about
the
apartment
and
doffed
his
hat
with
mock
ceremony
to
polixena
who
faced
him
like
a
princess
why
my
girl
said
he
amicably
i
think
i
saw
you
this
morning
in
the
square
on
the
arm
of
the
pantaloon
yonder
and
as
for
that
captain
spavent
and
he
pointed
a
derisive
finger
at
the
marquess
watched
him
drive
his
bully
trade
under
the
arcade
ever
since
i
first
dropped
anchor
in
these
waters
well
well
he
continued
his
indignation
subsiding
all
fair
in
carnival
i
suppose
but
this
gentleman
here
is
under
sailing
orders
and
i
fear
we
must
break
up
your
little
party
at
this
tony
saw
count
rialto
step
forward
looking
very
small
and
explanatory
and
uncovering
obsequiously
to
the
captain
i
can
assure
you
sir
said
the
count
in
his
best
english
that
this
incident
is
the
result
of
an
unfortunate
misunderstanding
and
if
you
will
oblige
us
by
dismissing
these
myrmidons
any
of
my
friends
here
will
be
happy
to
offer
satisfaction
to
bracknell
and
his
companions
mounce
shrank
visibly
at
this
and
the
captain
burst
into
a
loud
guffaw
satisfaction
says
he
why
my
cock
that
very
handsome
of
you
considering
the
rope
at
your
throats
but
we
not
take
advantage
of
your
generosity
for
i
fear
bracknell
has
already
trespassed
on
it
too
long
you
pack
of
you
he
spluttered
suddenly
decoying
young
innocents
with
that
devil
bait
of
yours
his
eye
fell
on
polixena
and
his
voice
softened
unaccountably
ah
well
we
must
all
see
the
carnival
once
i
suppose
he
said
all
well
that
ends
well
as
the
fellow
says
in
the
play
and
now
if
you
please
bracknell
if
you
take
the
reverend
gentleman
arm
there
we
bid
adieu
to
our
hospitable
entertainers
and
right
about
face
for
the
hepzibah
