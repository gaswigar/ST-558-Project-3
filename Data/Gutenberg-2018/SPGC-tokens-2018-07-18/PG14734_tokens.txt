introduction
encouraged
by
the
reviewer
who
announced
that
the
introduction
to
my
previous
collection
of
plays
was
the
best
part
of
the
book
i
venture
to
introduce
this
collection
in
a
similar
manner
but
i
shall
be
careful
not
to
overdo
it
this
time
in
the
hope
that
i
may
win
from
my
critic
some
such
tribute
as
milne
has
certainly
improved
as
a
dramatist
in
that
his
plays
are
now
slightly
better
than
his
introduction
since
then
i
am
trying
to
make
this
preface
as
distasteful
as
possible
in
order
that
the
plays
may
shine
out
the
more
pleasantly
i
shall
begin
how
better
with
an
attack
on
the
dramatic
critics
i
will
relate
a
little
conversation
which
took
place
shortly
after
the
publication
of
first
plays
between
myself
and
a
very
much
more
eminent
dramatist
eminent
dramatist
kindly
your
book
seems
to
have
been
well
reviewed
myself
ungratefully
not
bad
by
those
who
reviewed
it
but
i
doubt
if
it
was
noticed
by
more
than
three
regular
dramatic
critics
and
considering
that
two
of
the
plays
in
it
had
never
been
produced
eminent
dramatist
amused
by
my
innocence
my
dear
fellow
need
complain
i
published
an
unproduced
play
a
little
while
ago
and
it
did
get
a
single
notice
from
anybody
now
i
hope
that
however
slightly
the
conversations
in
the
plays
which
follow
may
move
the
dramatic
critic
he
will
at
least
be
disturbed
by
this
little
dialogue
all
of
us
who
are
interested
in
the
theatre
are
accustomed
to
read
and
sometimes
to
make
ridiculous
accusations
against
the
theatrical
manager
we
condemn
the
mercenary
fellow
because
he
will
not
risk
a
loss
of
two
or
three
thousand
pounds
on
the
intellectual
masterpiece
of
a
promising
young
dramatist
preferring
to
put
on
some
contemptible
but
popular
rubbish
which
is
certain
to
fill
his
theatre
but
now
we
see
that
the
dramatic
critic
that
stern
upholder
of
the
best
interests
of
the
british
drama
will
not
himself
risk
six
shillings
and
perhaps
two
or
three
hours
of
his
time
in
order
to
read
the
intellectual
masterpiece
of
the
promising
young
dramatist
and
so
to
be
able
to
tell
us
with
authority
whether
the
manager
really
refusing
masterpieces
or
no
he
will
not
risk
six
shillings
in
order
to
encourage
that
promising
young
dramatist
discouraged
enough
already
poor
devil
in
his
hopes
of
fame
and
fortune
by
telling
him
that
he
right
and
that
his
plays
are
worth
something
or
alternatively
to
prevent
him
from
wasting
any
more
of
his
youth
upon
an
to
which
he
is
not
suited
no
he
will
not
risk
his
shillings
but
he
will
write
an
important
and
let
us
hope
article
informing
us
that
the
british
drama
is
going
to
the
dogs
and
that
no
promising
young
dramatist
is
ever
given
a
fair
chance
absurd
is
it
let
us
consider
this
young
dramatist
for
a
moment
and
ask
ourselves
why
he
goes
on
writing
his
masterpieces
i
give
three
reasons
in
their
order
of
importance
the
pleasure
of
writing
or
more
accurately
the
hell
of
not
writing
he
gets
this
anyhow
the
appreciation
of
his
peers
his
hope
of
immortality
the
criticism
of
the
experts
fame
publicity
notoriety
swank
call
it
what
you
will
but
it
is
obvious
that
he
can
not
have
it
unless
the
masterpiece
is
given
to
the
world
either
by
manager
or
publisher
money
if
the
masterpiece
is
published
only
very
little
if
produced
possibly
a
great
deal
as
i
say
he
gets
his
first
reward
anyhow
but
let
us
be
honest
with
ourselves
how
many
of
us
would
write
our
masterpieces
on
a
desert
island
with
no
possibility
of
being
rescued
well
perhaps
all
of
us
for
we
should
feel
that
even
if
not
rescued
ourselves
our
manuscripts
written
on
bark
with
a
burnt
stick
clutched
in
a
skeleton
hand
might
be
recovered
later
by
some
literary
as
it
might
be
conrad
but
how
many
of
us
would
write
masterpieces
if
we
had
to
burn
them
immediately
afterwards
or
if
we
were
alone
upon
the
world
the
last
survivors
of
a
new
flood
could
we
bear
to
write
could
we
bear
not
to
write
it
is
not
fair
to
ask
us
but
we
can
admit
this
much
without
reserve
it
is
the
second
reward
which
tears
at
us
and
lacking
it
we
should
lose
courage
so
when
the
promising
young
dramatist
has
his
play
refused
by
the
managers
after
what
weeks
months
years
of
hope
and
fear
uncertainty
and
bitter
disappointment
he
has
this
great
consolation
anyway
i
can
always
publish
it
perhaps
after
a
dozen
refusals
a
manager
offers
to
put
on
his
play
on
condition
that
he
alters
the
obviously
right
and
unhappy
ending
into
the
obviously
foolish
but
happy
ending
which
will
charm
the
public
does
he
the
artist
succumb
how
easy
to
tell
himself
that
he
must
get
his
play
before
the
public
somehow
and
that
even
if
it
is
not
play
now
yet
the
first
two
acts
are
as
he
wrote
them
and
that
if
only
to
feel
the
thrill
of
the
audience
at
that
great
scene
between
the
burglar
and
the
bishop
his
creations
he
must
deaden
his
conscience
to
the
absurdity
of
a
happy
ending
but
does
he
succumb
no
heroically
he
tells
himself
anyway
i
can
publish
it
and
i
certain
that
the
critics
will
agree
with
me
that
but
the
critics
are
too
busy
to
bother
about
him
they
are
busy
informing
the
world
that
the
british
drama
is
going
to
the
dogs
and
that
no
promising
young
dramatist
ever
gets
a
fair
chance
let
me
say
here
that
i
am
airing
no
personal
grievance
i
doubt
if
any
dramatist
has
less
right
to
feel
aggrieved
against
the
critics
the
managers
the
public
the
world
than
i
and
whatever
right
i
have
i
renounce
in
return
for
the
good
things
which
i
have
received
from
them
but
i
do
not
renounce
the
grievance
of
our
craft
i
say
that
in
the
case
of
all
dramatists
it
is
the
business
of
the
dramatic
critics
to
review
their
unacted
plays
when
published
some
of
them
do
most
of
them
do
not
it
is
ridiculous
for
those
who
do
not
to
pretend
that
they
take
any
real
interest
in
the
british
drama
but
i
say
review
not
praise
let
them
damn
by
all
means
if
the
plays
are
unworthy
and
by
damning
do
so
much
of
justice
to
the
managers
who
refused
them
we
can
now
pass
on
safely
to
the
plays
in
this
volume
we
begin
with
a
children
play
the
difficulty
in
the
way
of
writing
a
children
play
is
that
barrie
was
born
too
soon
many
people
must
have
felt
the
same
about
shakespeare
we
who
came
later
have
no
chance
what
fun
to
have
been
adam
and
to
have
had
the
whole
world
of
plots
and
jokes
and
stories
at
one
disposal
possibly
however
one
would
never
have
thought
of
the
things
of
course
there
are
still
others
to
come
after
us
but
our
works
are
not
immortal
and
they
will
plagiarise
us
without
protest
yet
i
have
hopes
of
for
it
had
the
honour
of
inaugurating
nigel
playfair
management
at
the
lyric
hammersmith
it
is
possible
that
the
historians
will
remember
this
long
after
they
have
forgotten
my
plays
more
likely
alas
that
their
history
will
be
dated
after
drinkwater
and
that
the
honour
will
be
given
to
abraham
lincoln
i
like
to
think
that
in
this
event
my
ghost
will
haunt
them
appeared
with
a
prologue
by
the
manager
lyrics
by
burton
and
music
by
georges
dorlay
as
the
states
that
this
book
is
in
the
language
of
children
competitions
my
own
unaided
work
i
print
the
play
with
a
new
prologue
and
without
the
charming
lyrics
but
the
reader
is
told
when
he
may
burst
into
an
improvisation
of
his
own
though
i
warn
him
that
he
will
not
make
such
a
good
show
of
it
as
did
my
collaborators
pim
passes
appeared
at
several
theatres
let
us
admit
cheerfully
that
it
was
a
success
in
spite
of
the
warning
of
an
important
gentleman
in
the
theatrical
world
who
told
me
while
i
was
writing
it
that
the
public
would
stand
any
talk
of
bigamy
and
suggested
that
george
and
olivia
should
be
engaged
only
not
married
hence
the
line
bigamy
it
an
ugly
word
in
the
second
act
but
of
course
nobody
sees
more
clearly
than
i
how
largely
its
success
was
due
to
dion
boucicault
and
miss
irene
vanbrugh
romantic
appeared
first
at
the
comedy
and
like
found
in
its
need
a
home
at
the
playhouse
miss
gladys
cooper
has
a
charming
way
of
withdrawing
into
a
nursing
home
whenever
i
want
a
theatre
but
i
beg
her
not
to
make
a
habit
of
it
my
plays
can
be
spared
so
much
more
easily
than
she
by
the
way
a
word
about
melisande
many
of
the
critics
said
that
nobody
behaved
like
that
nowadays
i
am
terrified
at
the
thought
of
arguing
with
them
for
they
can
always
reduce
me
to
blushes
with
a
scornful
my
dear
man
you
do
that
in
a
and
when
they
tell
me
to
remember
what
strindberg
said
in
if
he
were
alive
then
i
really
do
know
or
what
aristotle
wrote
in
no
i
sha
even
guess
at
aristotle
well
then
i
want
to
burst
into
tears
my
ignorance
is
so
profound
so
very
humbly
i
just
say
now
that
when
melisande
talks
and
behaves
in
a
certain
way
i
do
not
mean
that
a
particular
girl
exists
miss
jones
of
bedford
park
who
talks
and
behaves
like
this
but
i
do
mean
that
there
is
a
type
of
girl
who
in
her
heart
secretly
like
this
if
from
your
great
knowledge
of
the
most
secret
places
of
a
young
girl
heart
you
tell
me
that
there
is
no
such
type
then
i
shall
only
smile
but
if
you
inform
me
sternly
that
a
dramatist
has
no
business
to
express
an
attitude
in
terms
of
an
actress
then
you
reduce
me
to
blushes
again
for
i
really
know
nothing
about
and
i
am
only
sustained
by
two
beliefs
the
first
is
that
rules
are
always
made
for
the
other
people
the
second
is
that
if
a
play
by
me
is
not
obviously
by
me
and
as
obviously
not
by
anybody
else
then
obviously
i
had
no
business
to
write
it
of
the
plays
camberley
and
nothing
much
need
be
said
the
former
was
played
at
the
coliseum
the
latter
written
for
miss
winifred
emery
was
deemed
by
the
management
too
serious
for
that
place
of
amusement
this
however
was
to
the
great
advantage
of
the
play
for
now
it
has
appeared
only
at
charity
with
an
cast
as
before
the
plays
are
printed
in
the
order
in
which
they
were
written
in
this
case
between
october
and
june
may
the
reader
get
as
much
enjoyment
from
them
as
i
had
in
their
writing
but
no
that
is
plainly
impossible
milne
a
children
play
in
a
prologue
and
three
acts
was
first
produced
at
the
lyric
theatre
hammersmith
on
december
the
chief
parts
were
played
by
marjory
holman
jean
cadell
rosa
lynd
betty
chester
roy
lennol
john
barclay
kinsey
peile
stanley
drewitt
ivan
berlyn
and
herbert
marshall
several
parts
each
prologue
the
playroom
of
the
hubbard
family
nine
of
them
counting
and
hubbard
we
realize
that
there
are
eleven
hubbards
in
all
and
you
would
think
that
one
at
least
of
the
two
people
we
see
in
the
room
would
be
a
hubbard
of
sorts
but
no
the
tall
manly
figure
is
james
the
hubbards
butler
for
the
hubbards
are
able
to
afford
a
butler
now
how
different
from
the
time
when
old
mother
hubbard
called
old
because
she
was
at
least
and
mother
because
she
had
a
passion
for
children
could
not
even
find
a
bone
for
her
faithful
terrier
but
of
course
that
was
before
henry
went
into
work
well
the
tall
figure
is
james
the
butler
and
the
little
one
is
rosemary
a
friend
of
the
hubbard
family
rosemary
is
going
in
for
literature
this
afternoon
as
it
raining
and
james
is
making
her
quite
comfortable
first
with
pens
and
ink
and
always
so
important
when
one
wants
to
write
he
has
even
thought
of
a
stick
of
violet
after
that
there
can
be
no
excuse
rosemary
thank
you
james
she
sits
down
if
any
one
calls
i
am
not
at
home
james
yes
miss
rosemary
you
may
add
that
i
am
engaged
in
writing
my
auto
autobiography
james
yes
miss
rosemary
it
what
every
one
writes
is
it
james
james
i
believe
so
miss
rosemary
thank
you
he
goes
to
the
door
oh
james
james
yes
miss
rosemary
what
an
autobiography
james
well
i
could
rightly
say
miss
not
to
explain
it
properly
rosemary
dismayed
oh
james
i
thought
you
knew
everything
james
in
the
ordinary
way
yes
miss
but
every
now
and
then
rosemary
it
very
upsetting
james
yes
miss
how
would
it
be
to
write
a
play
instead
very
easy
work
they
tell
me
rosemary
nodding
yes
that
much
better
i
write
a
play
thank
you
james
james
not
at
all
miss
he
goes
out
rosemary
bites
her
pen
and
thinks
deeply
at
last
the
inspiration
comes
rosemary
as
she
writes
hyphen
she
stops
and
frowns
now
which
way
it
she
tries
it
on
the
looks
wrong
she
tries
it
again
so
does
that
oh
dear
she
rings
the
bell
james
returns
james
yes
miss
rosemary
james
i
have
decided
to
call
my
play
james
yes
miss
rosemary
carelessly
when
you
spell
believe
it
is
it
james
yes
miss
rosemary
i
thought
at
first
it
was
james
now
you
mention
it
i
think
it
is
miss
rosemary
reproachfully
oh
james
are
you
certain
james
make
he
stops
and
scratches
his
whiskers
rosemary
yes
got
as
far
as
that
james
rosemary
you
see
james
it
spoils
the
play
if
you
have
an
accident
to
the
very
first
word
of
it
james
yes
miss
i
noticed
sometimes
that
if
one
writes
a
word
on
the
and
then
looks
at
it
with
the
head
on
one
side
there
a
sort
of
instinct
comes
over
one
as
makes
one
say
with
a
shake
of
the
head
rotten
one
can
then
write
it
the
other
way
more
hopeful
rosemary
i
tried
that
james
then
might
i
suggest
miss
that
you
give
it
another
name
altogether
as
it
might
be
susan
saturday
night
all
easy
words
to
spell
or
red
revenge
or
rosemary
i
call
it
because
it
all
of
the
play
i
thought
of
so
far
james
quite
so
miss
then
how
would
it
be
to
spell
it
wrong
on
purpose
it
comes
funnier
that
way
sometimes
rosemary
does
it
james
yes
miss
makes
laugh
rosemary
oh
well
which
the
wrong
way
james
ah
there
you
got
me
again
miss
rosemary
inspired
i
know
what
i
do
i
spell
it
and
if
it
right
then
i
right
and
if
it
wrong
then
i
funny
james
yes
miss
that
the
safest
rosemary
thank
you
james
james
not
at
all
miss
he
goes
out
rosemary
writing
a
christmas
entertainment
she
stops
and
thinks
and
then
shakes
her
head
no
play
a
christmas
play
in
three
acts
er
she
is
stuck
james
beg
pardon
miss
but
the
misses
and
masters
hubbard
are
without
and
crave
admittance
rosemary
all
nine
of
them
james
without
having
counted
them
miss
i
should
say
that
the
majority
of
them
were
present
rosemary
did
you
say
that
i
was
not
at
home
james
yes
miss
they
said
that
this
being
their
house
and
you
being
a
visitor
if
you
been
at
home
then
you
would
have

all
good
or
words
to
that
effect
rosemary
biting
her
pen
i

with
the
fairy
story
there
is
an
anxious
silence
none
of
them
has
ever
seen
anybody
writing
a
play
before
how
does
one
do
it
alas
rosemary
herself
does
know
she
appeals
to
james
james
how
you
begin
a
play
i
mean
when
you
the
title
james
a
man
of
genius
well
miss
rosemary
seeing
that
it
to
be
called
why
not
as
it
written
already
rosemary
what
a
good
idea
james
james
all
that
is
necessary
is
for
the
company
to
think
very
hard
of
what
they
want
and
there
we
are
saves
all
the
bother
of
writing
and
spelling
and
what
not
rosemary
admiringly
james
how
clever
you
are
james
miss
rosemary
rosemary
now
then
let
all
think
together
are
you
all
ready
all
yes
they
clench
their
hands
rosemary
then
one
two
three
go
they
think
the
truth
is
that
james
who
was
really
meant
to
be
in
it
thinks
too
if
there
is
anything
in
the
play
which
you
like
it
is
james
thinking
act
the
princess
and
the
woodcutter
the
woodcutter
is
discovered
singing
at
his
work
in
a
glade
of
the
forest
outside
his
hut
he
is
tall
and
strong
and
brave
and
handsome
all
that
a
woodcutter
ought
to
be
now
it
happened
that
the
princess
was
passing
and
as
soon
as
his
song
is
finished
sure
enough
on
she
comes
princess
good
morning
woodcutter
woodcutter
good
morning
but
he
goes
on
with
his
work
princess
after
a
pause
good
morning
woodcutter
woodcutter
good
morning
princess
do
you
ever
say
anything
except
good
morning
woodcutter
sometimes
i
say
princess
you
a
cross
woodcutter
woodcutter
i
have
work
to
do
princess
you
are
still
cutting
wood
do
you
ever
do
anything
else
woodcutter
well
you
are
still
a
princess
do
ever
do
anything
else
princess
reproachfully
now
that
not
fair
woodcutter
you
say
i
was
a
princess
yesterday
when
i
came
and
helped
you
stack
your
wood
or
the
day
before
when
i
tied
up
your
hand
where
you
had
cut
it
or
the
day
before
that
when
we
had
our
meal
together
on
the
grass
was
i
a
princess
then
woodcutter
somehow
i
think
you
were
somehow
i
think
you
were
saying
to
yourself
is
it
sweet
of
a
princess
to
treat
a
mere
woodcutter
like
this
princess
i
think
you
perfectly
horrid
i
a
good
mind
never
to
speak
to
you
again
and
and
i
would
if
only
i
could
be
sure
that
you
would
notice
i
was
speaking
to
you
woodcutter
after
all
i
just
as
bad
as
you
only
yesterday
i
was
thinking
to
myself
how
unselfish
i
was
to
interrupt
my
work
in
order
to
talk
to
a
mere
princess
princess
yes
but
the
trouble
is
that
you
interrupt
your
work
woodcutter
interrupting
it
and
going
up
to
her
with
a
smile
madam
i
am
at
your
service
princess
i
wish
i
thought
you
were
woodcutter
surely
you
have
enough
people
at
your
service
already
princes
and
chancellors
and
chamberlains
and
waiting
maids
princess
yes
that
just
it
that
why
i
want
your
help
particularly
in
the
matter
of
the
princes
woodcutter
why
has
a
suitor
come
for
the
hand
of
her
royal
highness
princess
three
suitors
and
i
hate
them
all
woodcutter
and
which
are
you
going
to
marry
princess
i
do
know
father
has
made
up
his
mind
yet
woodcutter
and
this
is
a
matter
which
father
which
his
majesty
decides
for
himself
princess
why
of
course
you
should
read
the
history
books
woodcutter
the
suitors
to
the
hand
of
a
princess
are
always
set
some
trial
of
strength
or
test
of
quality
by
the
king
and
the
winner
marries
his
daughter
woodcutter
well
i
do
live
in
a
palace
and
i
think
my
own
thoughts
about
these
things
i
better
get
back
to
my
work
he
goes
on
with
his
chopping
princess
gently
after
a
pause
woodcutter
woodcutter
looking
up
oh
are
you
there
i
thought
you
were
married
by
this
time
princess
meekly
i
do
want
to
be
married
hastily
i
mean
not
to
any
of
those
three
woodcutter
you
ca
help
yourself
princess
i
know
that
why
i
wanted
to
help
me
woodcutter
going
up
to
her
can
a
simple
woodcutter
help
a
princess
princess
well
perhaps
a
simple
one
could
but
a
clever
one
might
woodcutter
what
would
his
reward
be
princess
his
reward
would
be
that
the
princess
not
being
married
to
any
of
her
three
suitors
would
still
be
able
to
help
him
chop
his
wood
in
the
mornings
i
helping
you
are
i
woodcutter
smiling
oh
decidedly
princess
nodding
i
thought
i
was
woodcutter
it
is
kind
of
a
great
lady
like
yourself
to
help
so
humble
a
fellow
as
princess
meekly
i
not
great
and
she
is
she
is
the
smallest
daintiest
little
princess
that
ever
you
saw
woodcutter
there
enough
of
you
to
make
a
hundred
men
unhappy
princess
and
one
man
happy
woodcutter
and
one
man
very
very
happy
princess
innocently
i
wonder
who
he
be
woodcutter
if
were
a
prince
would
you
be
my
suitor
woodcutter
scornfully
one
of
three
princess
excitedly
oo
would
you
kill
the
others
with
that
axe
woodcutter
i
would
not
kill
them
in
order
to
help
his
majesty
make
up
his
mind
about
his
but
if
the
princess
had
made
up
her
mind
and
wanted
me
princess
yes
woodcutter
then
i
would
marry
her
however
many
suitors
she
had
princess
well
she
only
got
three
at
present
woodcutter
what
is
that
to
me
princess
oh
i
just
thought
you
might
want
to
be
doing
something
to
your
axe
woodcutter
my
axe
princess
yes
you
see
she
made
up
her
mind
woodcutter
amazed
you
mean
but
but
i
only
a
woodcutter
princess
that
where
you
have
the
advantage
of
them
when
it
comes
to
axes
woodcutter
princess
he
takes
her
in
his
arms
my
princess
princess
woodcutter
my
woodcutter
my
oh
so
very
slow
and
uncomprehending
but
entirely
adorable
woodcutter
they
sing
together
they
just
happen
to
feel
like
that
woodcutter
the
song
finished
but
what
will
his
majesty
say
princess
all
sorts
of
things
do
you
really
love
me
woodcutter
or
have
i
proposed
to
you
under
a
misapprehension
woodcutter
i
adore
you
princess
nodding
i
thought
you
did
but
i
wanted
to
hear
you
say
it
if
i
had
been
a
simple
peasant
i
suppose
you
would
have
said
it
a
long
time
ago
woodcutter
i
expect
so
princess
nodding
yes
well
now
we
must
think
of
a
plan
for
making
mother
like
you
woodcutter
might
i
just
kiss
you
again
before
we
begin
princess
well
i
do
quite
see
how
i
am
to
stop
you
the
woodcutter
picks
her
up
in
his
arms
and
kisses
her
woodcutter
there
princess
in
his
arms
oh
woodcutter
woodcutter
why
did
you
do
that
the
first
day
i
saw
you
then
i
need
have
had
the
bother
of
proposing
to
you
he
puts
her
down
suddenly
what
is
it
woodcutter
listening
somebody
coming
he
peers
through
the
trees
and
then
says
in
surprise
the
king
princess
oh
i
must
fly
woodcutter
but
you
come
back
princess
perhaps
she
disappears
quickly
through
the
trees
the
woodcutter
goes
on
with
his
work
and
is
discovered
at
it
a
minute
later
by
the
king
and
queen
king
puffing
ah
and
a
seat
all
ready
for
us
how
satisfying
they
sit
down
a
distinguished
couple
reading
from
left
to
right
king
queen
on
a
bench
outside
the
woodcutter
hut
queen
crossly
she
was
like
that
i
do
know
why
you
dragged
me
here
king
as
i
told
you
my
love
to
be
alone
queen
well
you
are
alone
she
indicates
the
woodcutter
king
pooh
he
does
matter
well
now
about
these
three
princes
they
are
getting
on
my
mind
rather
it
is
time
we
decided
which
one
of
them
is
to
marry
our
beloved
child
the
trouble
is
to
choose
between
them
queen
as
regards
appetite
there
is
nothing
to
choose
between
them
they
are
three
of
the
heartiest
eaters
i
have
met
for
some
time
king
you
are
right
the
sooner
we
choose
one
of
them
and
send
the
other
two
about
their
business
the
better
reflectively
there
were
six
peaches
on
the
this
morning
did
i
get
one
no
queen
did
get
one
no
king
did
our
darling
child
get
one
not
that
it
matters
no
queen
it
is
a
pity
that
the
bull
died
last
year
king
yes
he
had
a
way
of
sorting
out
competitors
for
the
hand
of
our
beloved
one
that
was
beyond
all
praise
one
could
have
felt
quite
sure
that
had
the
three
competitors
been
introduced
to
him
only
one
of
them
would
have
taken
any
further
interest
in
the
matter
queen
always
the
housekeeper
and
even
he
might
have
taken
any
interest
in
his
meals
king
with
a
sigh
however
those
days
are
over
we
must
think
of
a
new
test
somehow
i
think
that
in
a
moral
worth
is
even
more
to
be
desired
than
mere
brute
strength
now
my
suggestion
is
this
that
you
should
disguise
yourself
as
a
beggar
woman
and
approach
each
of
the
three
princes
in
turn
supplicating
their
charity
in
this
way
we
shall
discover
which
of
the
three
has
the
kindest
heart
what
do
you
say
my
dear
queen
an
excellent
plan
if
you
remember
i
suggested
it
myself
yesterday
king
annoyed
well
of
course
it
had
been
in
my
mind
for
some
time
i
do
claim
that
the
idea
is
original
it
has
often
been
done
in
our
family
getting
up
well
then
if
you
will
get
ready
my
dear
i
will
go
and
find
our
three
friends
and
see
that
they
come
this
way
they
go
out
together
as
soon
as
they
are
out
of
sight
the
princess
comes
back
princess
well
woodcutter
what
did
i
tell
you
woodcutter
what
did
you
tell
me
princess
did
you
listen
to
what
they
said
woodcutter
i
did
listen
but
i
could
help
hearing
princess
well
could
help
listening
and
unless
you
stop
it
somehow
i
shall
be
married
to
one
of
them
woodcutter
which
one
princess
the
one
with
the
kindest
heart
whichever
that
is
woodcutter
supposing
they
all
three
have
kind
hearts
princess
confidently
they
wo
they
never
have
in
our
circles
when
three
princes
come
together
one
of
them
has
a
kind
heart
and
the
other
two
have
surprised
have
you
read
any
history
at
all
woodcutter
i
have
no
time
for
reading
but
i
think
it
time
history
was
altered
a
little
we
alter
it
this
afternoon
princess
what
do
you
mean
woodcutter
leave
this
to
me
i
got
an
idea
princess
clapping
her
hands
oh
how
clever
of
you
but
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
woodcutter
pointing
you
know
the
glade
over
there
where
the
brook
runs
through
it
wait
for
me
there
princess
i
obey
my
lord
commands
she
blows
him
a
kiss
and
runs
off
the
woodcutter
resumes
his
work
by
and
by
the
red
prince
comes
along
he
is
a
well
you
will
see
for
yourself
what
he
is
like
red
prince
ah
fellow
fellow
i
said
fellow
yes
that
sort
of
man
woodcutter
looking
up
were
you
speaking
to
me
my
lord
red
prince
there
is
no
other
fellow
here
that
i
can
see
the
woodcutter
looks
round
to
make
sure
peers
behind
a
tree
or
two
and
comes
back
to
the
prince
woodcutter
yes
you
must
have
meant
me
red
prince
yes
of
course
i
meant
you
fellow

you
seen
the
princess
come
past
this
way
i
was
told
she
was
waiting
for
me
here
woodcutter

is
not
here
my
lord
looking
round
to
see
that
they
are
alone
my
lord

you
one
of
the
princes
who
is
seeking
the
hand
of
the
princess
red
prince
complacently
i
am
fellow
woodcutter
his
majesty
the
king
was
here
a
while
ago
he
is
to
make
his
decision
between
you
this
afternoon
meaningly
i
think
i
can
help
you
to
be
the
lucky
one
my
lord
red
prince
you
suggest
that
i
take
an
unfair
advantage
over
my
woodcutter
i
suggest
nothing
my
lord
i
only
say
that
i
can
help
you
red
prince
magnanimously
well
i
will
allow
you
to
help
me
woodcutter
thank
you
then
i
will
give
you
this
advice
if
a
beggar
woman
asks
you
for
a
crust
of
bread
this
afternoon
remember
it
is
the
test
red
prince
staggered
the
test
but
i
have
a
crust
of
bread
woodcutter
wait
here
and
i
will
get
you
one
he
goes
into
the
hut
red
prince
speaking
after
him
as
he
goes
my
good
fellow
i
am
extremely
obliged
to
you
and
if

i
can
do
anything
for
you
such
as
returning
a
crust
to
you
of
similar
size
or
even
lending
you
another
slightly
smaller
one
or
the
woodcutter
comes
back
with
the
crust
ah
thank
you
my
man
thank
you
woodcutter
i
would
suggest
my
lord
that
you
should
take
a
short
walk
in
this
direction
pointing
to
the
opposite
direction
to
that
which
the
princess
has
taken
and
stroll
back
casually
in
a
few
minutes
time
when
the
queen
is
here
red
prince
thank
you
my
man
thank
you
he
puts
the
crust
in
his
pocket
and
goes
off
the
woodcutter
goes
on
with
his
work
the
blue
prince
comes
in
and
stands
watching
him
in
silence
for

not
quite
fair
to
the
others

pauses
a
moment
and

will
ask

for
a
crust
of
bread

give
it
to

the
way

kindness
of

in
his
pockets

bread
woodcutter

will

on
with
his
work
the
blue
prince
remains
looking
at
him
blue
prince
with
a
great
effort
thanks
he
goes
slowly
away
a
moment
later
the
yellow
prince
makes
a
graceful
and
languid
entry
yellow
prince
ah

hither
my
man

woodcutter
stopping
his

and
looking
up

princess
passed
this
way
lately
woodcutter
the
princess
yellow
prince
yes
the
princess
my
bumpkin
but
perhaps
you
have
been
too
much
concerned
in
your
own
earthy
affairs
to
have
noticed
her
you
ah
cut
wood
i
see
woodcutter
yes
sir
i
am
a
woodcutter
yellow
prince
a
most
absorbing
life
some
day
we
must
have
a
long
talk
about
it
but
just
now
i
have
other
business
waiting
for
me
with
your
permission
good
friend
i
will
leave
you
to
your
faggots
he
starts
to
go
woodcutter
beg
your
pardon
sir
but
are
you
one
of
those
princes
that
want
to
marry
our
princess
yellow
prince
i
had
hoped
good
friend
to
obtain
your
permission
to
do
so
i
beg
you
not
to
refuse
it
woodcutter
you
are
making
fun
of
me
sir
yellow
prince
discerning
creature
woodcutter
all
the
same
i
help
you
yellow
prince
then
pray
do
so
and
earn
my
everlasting
gratitude
woodcutter
the
king
has
decided
that
whichever
of
you
three
princes
has
the
kindest
heart
shall
marry
his
daughter
yellow
prince
then
you
will
be
able
to
bear
witness
to
him
that
i
have
already
wasted
several
minutes
of
my
valuable
time
in
condescending
to
a
mere
tell
him
this
and
the
prize
is
mine
kissing
the
tips
of
his
fingers
princess
i
embrace
you
woodcutter
the
king
will
not
listen
to
me
but
if
you
return
here
in
five
minutes
you
will
find
an
old
woman
begging
for
bread
it
is
the
test
which
their
majesties
have
arranged
for
you
if
you
share
your
last
crust
with
her
yellow
prince
yes
but
do
i
look
as
if
i
carried
a
last
crust
about
with
me
woodcutter
but
see
i
will
give
you
one
yellow
prince
taking
it
between
the
tips
of
his
fingers
yes
but
woodcutter
put
it
in
your
pocket
and
when
yellow
prince
but
my
dear
have
you
no
feeling
for
clothes
at
all
how
can
i
put
a
thing
like
this
in
my
pocket
handing
it
back
to
him
i
beg
you
to
wrap
it
up
here
take
this
gives
him
a
scarf
neatly
i
pray
you
taking
an
orange
ribbon
out
of
his
pocket
perhaps
a
little
of
this
round
it
would
make
it
more
tolerable
you
think
so
i
leave
it
to
you
i
trust
your
taste
entirely
leaving
a
loop
for
the
little
finger
i
entreat
you
so
he
hangs
it
on
his
little
finger
in
about
five
minutes
you
said
we
will
be
there
with
a
bow
we
thank
you
he
departs
delicately
the
woodcutter
smiles
to
himself
puts
down
his
axe
and
goes
off
to
the
princess
and
just
in
time
for
behold
the
king
and
queen
return
at
least
we
think
it
is
the
queen
but
she
is
so
heavily
disguised
by
a
cloak
which
she
wears
over
her
court
dress
that
for
a
moment
we
are
not
quite
sure
king
now
then
my
love
if
you
will
sit
down
on
that
log
there
placing
her
excellent
i
think
perhaps
you
should
remove
the
crown
removes
it
there
now
the
disguise
is
perfect
queen
you
sure
they
are
coming
it
a
very
uncomfortable
seat
king
i
told
them
that
the
princess
was
waiting
for
them
here
their
natural
disappointment
at
finding
i
was
mistaken
will
make
the
test
of
their
good
nature
an
even
more
exacting
one
my
own
impression
is
that
the
yellow
prince
will
be
the
victor
queen
oh
i
hate
that
man
king
soothingly
well
well
perhaps
it
will
be
the
blue
one
queen
if
anything
i
dislike
him
intensely
king
or
even
the
red
queen
ugh
i
ca
bear
him
king
fortunately
dear
you
are
not
called
upon
to
marry
any
of
them
it
is
for
our
darling
that
we
are
making
the
great
decision
listen
i
hear
one
coming
i
will
hide
in
the
cottage
and
take
note
of
what
happens
he
disappears
into
the
cottage
as
the
blue
prince
comes
in
queen
oh
sir
can
you
kindly
spare
a
crust
of
bread
for
a
poor
old
woman
please
pretty
gentleman
blue
prince
standing
stolidly
in
front
of
her
and
feeling
in
his
pocket
bread
bread
ah
bread
he
offers
it
queen
oh
thank
you
sir
may
you
be
rewarded
for
your
gentle
heart
blue
prince
thank
you
he
stands
gazing
at
her
there
is
an
awkward
pause
queen
a
blessing
on
you
sir
blue
prince
thank
you
he
indicates
the
crust
bread
queen
ah
you
have
saved
the
life
of
a
poor
old
woman
blue
prince
eat
it
queen
embarrassed
i
er
you
er
she
takes
a
bite
and
mumbles
something
blue
prince
what
queen
swallowing
with
great
difficulty
i
almost
too
happy
to
eat
sir
leave
a
poor
old
woman
alone
with
her
happiness
and
blue
prince
not
too
happy
too
weak
help
you
eat
he
breaks
off
a
piece
and
holds
it
to
her
mouth
with
a
great
effort
the
queen
disposes
of
it
good
again
she
does
it
again
now
she
swallows
another
piece
last
piece
she
takes
it
in
he
pats
her
kindly
on
the
back
and
she
nearly
chokes
good
better
now
queen
weakly
much
blue
prince
good
day
queen
with
an
effort
good
day
kind
gentleman
he
goes
out
the
king
is
just
coming
from
the
cottage
when
he
returns
suddenly
the
king
slips
back
again
blue
prince
small
piece
left
over
he
gives
it
to
her
she
looks
hopelessly
at
him
he
goes
queen
throwing
the
piece
down
violently
ugh
what
a
man
king
coming
out
well
well
my
dear
we
have
discovered
the
winner
queen
from
the
heart
detestable
person
king
the
rest
of
the
competition
is
of
course
more
in
the
nature
of
a
formality
queen
thank
goodness
king
however
i
think
that
it
will
prevent
unnecessary
discussion
afterwards
if
we
take
care
here
is
another
one
he
hurries
back
the
red
queen
with
not
nearly
so
much
conviction
could
you
spare
a
crust
of
bread
sir
for
a
poor
hungry
old
woman

crust
of
bread

the
yellow

down
again

of

great
effort

on
my
desert
island
jill

desert
island

else
on
it
ever
oliver
oo
lots
of
pirates
and
dyaks
and
cannibals
and
other
people
jill
what
sort
of
other
people
oliver
i
sha
tell
you
this
is
a
special
think
i
thought
last
night
as
soon
as
i
thought
of
it
i
decided
to
keep
it
for
impressively
a
moment
of
great
emergency
jill
silenced
oh
oliver
oliver
yes
jill
let
me
be
on
your
desert
island
this
time
because
i
did
try
to
help
you
oliver
well
well
generously
well
you
can
if
you
like
jill
oh
thank
you
oliver
wo
you
tell
me
what
it
about
and
then
we
can
both
think
it
together
this
afternoon
oliver
i
expect
you
think
all
sorts
of
silly
things
that
happen
on
a
desert
island
jill
i
try
not
to
oliver
if
you
tell
me
oliver
all
right
jill
coming
close
to
him
go
on
oliver
well
you
see
i
been
wrecked
you
see
and
the
ship
has
foundered
with
all
hands
you
see
and
i
been
cast
ashore
on
a
desert
island
you
see
jill
have
i
been
cast
ashore
too
oliver
well
you
will
be
this
afternoon
of
course
well
you
see
we
land
on
the
island
you
see
and
it
a
perfectly
ripping
island
you
see
and
and
we
land
on
it
you
see
and
but
we
are
getting
on
too
fast
when
the
good
ship
crashed
upon
the
rock
and
split
in
twain
it
seemed
like
that
all
aboard
must
perish
fortunately
oliver
was
made
of
stern
mettle
hastily
constructing
a
raft
and
placing
the
now
unconscious
jill
upon
it
he
launched
it
into
the
seething
maelstrom
of
waters
and
pushed
off
tossed
like
a
upon
the
mountainous
waves
the
tiny
craft
with
its
precious
freight
was
in
imminent
danger
of
foundering
but
oliver
was
made
of
stern
mettle
with
dauntless
courage
he
rigged
a
and
placed
a
telescope
to
his
eye
pull
for
the
lagoon
jill
cried
the
dauntless
oliver
and
in
another
moment
as
the
raft
glides
into
the
still
waters
beyond
the
reef
we
can
see
it
more
clearly
can
it
be
jill
bed
with
oliver
in
his
pyjamas
perched
on
the
rail
and
holding
up
his
does
he
shorten
sail
for
a
moment
to
thump
his
chest
and
say
but
oliver
was
made
of
stern
mettle
or
is
it
but
the
sun
is
sinking
behind
the
swamp
where
the
rattlesnakes
bask
for
a
moment
longer
the
sail
gleams
like
copper
in
its
rays
and
then
we
have
lost
it
see
is
that
speck
on
the
inky
black
waters
the
dauntless
oliver
it
is
let
us
follow
to
the
island
and
see
what
adventures
befall
him
scene
it
is
the
island
which
we
have
dreamed
about
all
our
lives
but
at
present
we
can
not
see
it
properly
for
it
is
dark
in
one
of
those
tropical
darknesses
which
can
be
felt
rather
than
seen
oliver
hands
jill
out
of
the
boat
oliver
tread
carefully
jill
there
are
lots
of
deadly
rattlesnakes
about
jill
stepping
hastily
back
into
the
boat
oliver
you
hear
the
noise
of
their
rattles
sometimes
when
the
sun
is
sinking
behind
the
swamp
the
deadly
rattle
of
the
rattlesnake
is
heard
there
jill
oh
oliver
are
they
very
deadly
because
if
they
are
i
think
i
shall
like
your
island
oliver
those
are
i
always
have
their
teeth
taken
out
when
ladies
are
coming
besides
it
daylight
now
with
a
rapidity
common
in
the
tropics
although
it
may
just
be
oliver
gallantry
the
sun
climbs
out
of
the
sea
and
floods
the
island
jill
no
longer
frightened
steps
out
of
the
boat
and
they
walk
up
to
the
clearing
in
the
middle
jill
looking
about
her
oh
what
a
lovely
island
i
think
lovely
oliver
oliver
modestly
it
pretty
decent
is
it
wo
you
lie
down
i
generally
lie
down
here
and
watch
the
turtles
coming
out
of
the
sea
to
deposit
their
eggs
on
the
sand
jill
lying
down
how
many
do
they
usually
oliver
oliver
oh
three
or
a
hundred

how
hungry

a
wo

jill
excitedly
oh

you
bring
some
oliver
annoyed

some
brightening
up
oh

mean
from
the
wreck
jill
hastily
yes

the
wreck
i
mean
besides
the
axe
and
the
bag
of
nails
and
the
gunpowder
oliver
could
the
ship
sank
with
all
hands
before
i
could
get
them
but
it
does
matter
because
going
up
to
one
of
the
trees

picks
a
couple
of

i
have
always
been
looking
about

one
jill
oh
oliver
is
eric
a
man
oliver
casually
i
suppose
the
captain
is
generally
the
first
man
to
board
the
spaniard
with
his
cutlass
between
his
teeth
pirate
you
might
almost
say
always
many
a
ship
on
the
spanish
main
i
had
to
leave
unboarded
through
want
of
a
touchy
about
it
somehow
unless
the
captain
comes
first
they
get
complaining
oliver
bashfully
and
there
just
one
other
thing
if
the
brigantine
happened
to
put
in
at
an
island
for
water
and
the
captain
happened
just
happened
to
be
a
silly
ass
and
go
and
marry
a
dusky
maiden
whom
he
met
on
the
beach
pirate
bless
you
it
always
happening
to
a
oliver
in
a
magnificent
manner
then
captain
crookshank
you
may
take
my
sister
jill
thank
you
oliver
it
is
not
every
day
that
eric
that
famous
chieftain
marries
into
the
family
of
the
terror
of
the
dyaks
naturally
the
occasion
is
celebrated
by
the
whole
pirate
crew
with
a
rousing
chorus
followed
by
a
dance
in
which
the
dusky
maidens
of
the
island
join
at
the
end
of
it
jill
finds
herself
alone
with
the
dusky
princess
jill
fashionably
i
so
pleased
to
meet
my
brother
future

it
so
nice
of
you
to
come
to

have
some

puts

be
better
if

once
that

hates
it
it
is
very
important
that

you
oliver
not
at
all
jill
make
yourself
at
home
i
just
been
trying
the
doctor
in
the
lagoon
there
sharks
there
after
all
so
we
have
to
find
another
place
for
bathing
oh
and
i
shot
an
elephant
what
would
you
like
to
do
now
jill
just
let
lie
here
and
see
what
happens
what
happens
is
that
a
cassowary
comes
along
oh
what
a
lovely
bird
is
it
an
ostrich
the
cassowary
sniffs
the
air
puts
its
beak
to
the
ground
and
goes
off
again
oliver
silly
it
a
cassowary
of
course
jill
what
a
cassowary
oliver
jill
do
you
remember
the
rhyme
i
wish
i
were
a
cassowary
upon
the
plains
of
timbuctoo
and
then
i
eat
a
missionary
and
hat
and
gloves
and
too
jill
is
that
all
they
for
oliver
well
what
else
would
you
want
them
for
a
missionary
gloves
umbrella
all
complete
creeps
cautiously
up
he
bears
a
strong
likeness
to
the
curate
the
reverend
smilax
missionary
i
am
sorry
to
intrude
upon
your
privacy
dear
friends
but
have
you
observed
a
cassowary
on
this
island
apparently
looking
for
something
oliver
yes
we
saw
one
just
now
missionary
shuddering
dear
dear
dear
you
did
happen
to
ask
him
what
was
the
object
of
his
researches
jill
he
went
so
quickly
missionary
coming
out
of
the
undergrowth
to
them
i
wonder
if
you
have
ever
heard
of
a
little
rhyme
which
apparently
attributes
to
the
bird
in
question
when
residing
in
the
level
pastures
of
timbuctoo
an
unholy
lust
for
the
body
and
appurtenances
thereto
of
an
unnamed
clerical
gentleman
oliver
and
jill
shouting
together
yes
rather
missionary
dear
dear
fortunately
i
say
fortunately
this
is
not
timbuctoo
oliver
slips
away
and
comes
back
with
a
timbuctoo
which
he
places
at
the
edge
of
the
trees
unseen
by
the
missionary
who
goes
on
talking
to
jill
i
take
it
that
a
cassowary
residing
in
other
latitudes
is
of
a
more
temperate
habit
his
appetite
i
venture
to
suggest
dear
lady
would
be
under
better
restraint
that
being
so
i
may
perhaps
safely
he
begins
to
move
off
and
comes
suddenly
up
to
the
dear
dear
dear
dear
dear
this
is
terrible
you
said
i
think
that
the
ah
bird
in
question
was
moving
in
direction
oliver
that
right
missionary
then
i
shall
move
hastily
yet
with
all
due
precaution
in
direction
he
walks
off
on
tiptoe
looking
over
his
shoulder
in
case
the
cassowary
should
reappear
consequently
he
does
not
observe
the
enormous
cannibal
who
has
appeared
from
the
trees
on
the
right
until
he
bumps
into
him
i
beg
your
he
looks
up
dear
dear
dear
dear
dear
cannibal
boria

country

totally
unexpected
call
upon
me
in
another
locality

unfortunately
while
he
is
talking
the
cassowary
comes
back
sidles
up
to
him
and

with
his
beak
on
the
missionary

absently
without
looking
round

annoyed

clasps
the
cannibal
in

anguish

mouldy

measly
chief
standing

gentlemen
i
think
you
will
agree
with
me
that
the

has
proved
that
she
is
utterly
incapable
of
teaching
anybody
anything
years
man
and
boy
i
have
sailed
the
spanish
main
and
with
the
possible
exception
of
a
dumb
and
negro
whom
i
shipped
as
cook
in
i
have
never
met
any
one
so
profoundly
lacking
in
intellect
i
propose
therefore
that
for
the
space
of
hours
the
woman
pinniger
should
be
incarcerated
in
the
smuggler
cave
in
the
company
of
a
black

of
friendly

says
no
the
motion
is
carried
one
of
the
pirates
opens
the
door
of
the
cave
the
governess
rushes
to
the
chief
and
throws
herself
at
his
feet
oliver

jill
appear
in
the
nick
of

oliver
a
maiden

i
will
rescue

oliver
recognises
her
oh

night
comes
on
with
tropical
suddenness
the
singing
dies
slowly
down
act
father
christmas
and
the
hubbard
family
scene
the
of
the
hubbards
before
fame
and
prosperity
came
to
them
it
is
simply
furnished
with
a
deal
table
and
two
cane
chairs
and
hubbard
in
faultless
evening
dress
are
at
home
hubbard
reading
a
magazine
hubbard
with
her
hands
in
her
lap
she
sighs
hubbard
impetuously
throwing
down
his
magazine
dearest
you
sighed
hubbard
quickly
no
no
henry
in
a
luxurious
and
home
such
as
this
why
should
i
sigh
hubbard
true
dear
not
only
is
it
artistically
furnished
as
you
say
but
it
is
also
blessed
with
that
most
precious
of
all
things
he
lifts
up
the
magazine
a
library
hubbard
yes
yes
henry
we
have
much
to
be
thankful
for
hubbard
we
have
indeed
but
i
am
selfish
would
you
care
to
read
he
tears
out
a
page
of
the
magazine
and
hands
it
to
her
hubbard
thank
you
thank
you
henry
they
both
sit
in
silence
for
a
little
she
sighs
again
hubbard
darling
you
did
sigh
tell
me
what
grieves
you
hubbard
little
isabel
her
cough
troubles
me
hubbard
thoughtfully
isabel
hubbard
yes
dear
our
youngest
do
you
remember
she
comes
after
harold
hubbard
counting
on
his
fingers
a
b
c
d
e
f
g
h
i
dear
me
have
we
got
nine
already
hubbard
imploringly
darling
say
you
do
think
it
too
many
hubbard
oh
no
no
not
at
all
my
love
after
all
it
is
as
if
they
were
real
children
hubbard
indignantly
henry
how
can
you
say
they
are
not
real
hubbard
well
i
mean
they
only
the
children
we
thought
like
to
have
if
father
christmas
gave
us
any
hubbard
they
are
just
as
real
to
me
as
if
they
were
here
in
the
house
ada
bertram
caroline
the
dennis
pretty
elsie
with
the
golden
ringlets
dear
little
frank
hubbard
firmly
darling
one
frank
has
curly
brown
hair
it
was
an
understood
thing
that
you
should
choose
the
girls
and
should
choose
the
boys
when
we
decided
to
take
a
b
c
d
e
f
a
sixth
child
it
was
my
turn
for
a
boy
and
i
selected
frank
he
has
curly
brown
hair
and
a
fondness
for
animals
hubbard
i
daresay
you
right
dear
of
course
it
is
a
little
confusing
when
you
never
see
your
children
hubbard
well
well
perhaps
some
day
father
christmas
will
give
us
some
hubbard
why
does
he
neglect
us
so
henry
we
hang
up
our
stockings
every
year
but
he
never
seems
to
notice
them
even
a
diamond
necklace
or
a
few
oranges
or
a
postal
order
would
be
something
hubbard
it
is
very
strange
possibly
the
fact
that
the
chimney
has
not
been
swept
for
some
years
may
have
something
to
do
with
it
or
he
may
have
forgotten
our
change
of
address
i
can
not
help
feeling
that
if
he
knew
how
we
had
been
left
to
starve
in
this
way
he
would
be
very
much
annoyed
hubbard
and
clothes
i
have
literally
nothing
but
what
i
am
standing
up
in
i
mean
sitting
down
in
hubbard
nor
i
my
love
but
at
least
it
will
be
written
of
us
in
the
papers
that
the
hubbards
perished
in
faultless
evening
dress
we
are
a
proud
race
and
if
father
christmas
deliberately
cuts
us
off
in
this
way
let
us
go
down
proudly
shall
we
go
on
reading
or
would
you
like
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
fortunately
these
simple
pleasures
are
left
to
us
hubbard
i
finished
this
page
hubbard
tearing
out
one
have
another
my
love
they
read
for
a
little
while
until
interrupted
by
a
knock
at
the
door
hubbard
some
one
at
the
door
who
could
it
be
hubbard
getting
up
just
make
the
room
look
a
little
more
homey
dear
in
case
it
any
one
important
he
goes
out
leaving
her
to
alter
the
position
of
the
chairs
slightly
hubbard
well
hubbard
coming
in
a
letter
he
opens
it
hubbard
quick
hubbard
whistling
with
surprise
father
christmas
an
invitation
to
court
reading
father
christmas
at
home
december
jollifications
my
love
he
has
found
us
at
last
they
embrace
each
other
hubbard
henry
how
gratifying
hubbard
yes
sadly
after
a
pause
but
we
ca
go
hubbard
sadly
no
i
have
no
clothes
hubbard
nor
hubbard
how
can
i
possibly
go
without
a
diamond
necklace
none
of
the
women
has
ever
been
to
court
without
a
diamond
necklace
hubbard
the
hubbards
are
a
proud
race
no
male
hubbard
would
dream
of
appearing
at
court
without
a
gentleman
gold
albert
besides
there
is
another
thing
there
will
be
many
footmen
at
father
christmas
court
who
will
doubtless
require
coppers
pressed
into
their
palms
my
honour
would
be
seriously
affected
were
i
compelled
to
whisper
to
them
that
i
had
no
coppers
hubbard
it
is
very
unfortunate
father
christmas
may
have
hundreds
of
presents
waiting
for
us
hubbard
true
but
how
would
it
be
to
hang
up
our
stockings
again
this
evening
now
that
we
know
he
knows
we
are
here
i
would
suggest
tied
on
to
the
to
save
him
the
trouble
of
coming
down
the
chimney
hubbard
excitedly
henry
i
wonder
but
of
course
we
will
they
begin
to
take
off
the
one
a
sock
the
other
a
stocking
hubbard
i
almost
wish
now
that
my
last
suit
had
been
a
knickerbocker
one
however
we
must
do
what
we
can
with
a
sock
hubbard
holding
up
her
stocking
and
looking
at
it
a
little
anxiously
i
hope
father
christmas
wo
give
me
a
bicycle
a
stocking
never
sets
so
well
after
it
has
had
a
bicycle
in
it
hubbard
taking
it
from
her
now
dear
i
will
go
down
and
put
them
in
position
let
us
hope
that
fortune
will
be
kind
to
us
hubbard
let
us
hope
so
darling
and
quickly
for
picking
up
her
page
of
the
magazine
it
is
a
trifle
cold
he
goes
out
and
she
is
left
reading

so
i
never
made
much
of

a
scurvy
knave
from

the
chine

gather
that
he
inflicted
some
sort
of
a
scratch
upon
his
adversary
and
the
king
rewarded
him
with
this
handsome
ushers
announcing

may
i
have
the
pleasure
hubbard
to
riding
hood
be
careful
dear
he
has
a
very
bad
reputation
riding
hood
to
bluebeard
you
do
eat
people
do
you
bluebeard
pained
by
this
injustice
never
riding
hood
oh
then
i
do
mind
but
i
do
hate
being
eaten
now
we
ca
possibly
describe
the
whole
dance
to
you
for
in
every
corner
of
the
big
ballroom
couples
were
revolving
and
sliding
and
making
small
talk
with
each
other
so
we
will
just
take
two
specimen
conversations
crusoe
nervous
poor
man
princess
goldilocks
may
i
speak
to
you
on
a
matter
of
some
importance
to
me
goldilocks
i
wish
you
would
crusoe
looking
across
at
bluebeard
and
red
riding
hood
who
are
revolving
close
by
alone
goldilocks
to
bluebeard
do
you
mind
you
can
have
your
turn
afterwards
bluebeard
to
riding
hood
shall
we
adjourn
to
the
buffet
riding
hood
oh
do
let
they
adjourn
crusoe
bravely
princess
i
am
a
lonely
man
goldilocks
encouragingly
yes
robinson
crusoe
i
am
not
much
of
a
one
for
society
and
i
do
quite
know
how
to
put
these
things
but
er
if
you
would
like
to
share
my
island
i
i
should
so
love
to
have
you
there
goldilocks
oh
robbie
crusoe
warming
to
it
i
have
a
very
comfortable
house
and
a
and
an
excellent
view
from
the
south
windows
and
several
thousands
of
acres
of
good
and
oh
do
say
come
goldilocks
may
i
bring
my
bears
with
me
crusoe
of
course
i
ought
to
have
said
that
i
have
a
great
fondness
for
animals
goldilocks
how
sweet
of
you
but
perhaps
i
ought
to
warn
you
that
we
all
like
porridge
have
you
crusoe
i
have
a
hundred
acres
of
oats
goldilocks
then
robinson
i
am
yours
they
embrace
there
now
tell
me
did
you
make
all
your
clothes
yourself
crusoe
proudly
all
of
them
goldilocks
going
off
with
him
how
wonderful
of
you
really
you
hardly
seem
to
want
a
wife
they
go
out
now
it
is
the
other
couple
turn
enter
then
bluebeard
and
riding
hood
bluebeard
perhaps
i
ought
to
tell
you
at
once
miss
riding
hood
that
i
have
been
married
before
riding
hood
yes
bluebeard
my
last
wife
unfortunately
died
just
before
i
started
out
here
this
evening
riding
hood
calmly
did
you
kill
her
bluebeard
taken
aback
i
i
i
riding
hood
are
you
quite
a
nice
man
bluebeard
bluebeard
do
you
mean
i
am
a
very
man
if
you
will
marry
me
you
will
live
in
a
wonderful
castle
full
of
everything
that
you
want
riding
hood
that
will
be
rather
jolly
bluebeard
dramatically
but
there
is
one
room
into
which
you
must
never
go
holding
up
a
key
here
is
the
key
of
it
he
offers
it
to
her
riding
hood
indifferently
but
if
i
never
to
go
into
it
i
want
the
key
bluebeard
upset
you
you
have
the
key
riding
hood
why
bluebeard
the
the
others
all
had
it
riding
hood
coldly
bluebeard
you
are
going
to
talk
about
your
wives
all
the
time
are
you
bluebeard
n
no
riding
hood
then
do
be
silly
and
take
this
key
and
go
and
tidy
up
that
ridiculous
room
of
yours
and
when
it
nice
and
clean
and
when
you
shaved
off
that
absurd
beard
perhaps
i
marry
you
bluebeard
furiously
drawing
his
sword
madam
riding
hood
do
do
it
here
you
want
some
hot
water
bluebeard
trying
to
put
his
sword
back
this
is
too
much
this
is
riding
hood
you
putting
it
in
the
wrong
way
round
bluebeard
stiffly
thank
you
he
manages
to
get
it
in
riding
hood
well
do
you
want
to
marry
me
bluebeard
yes
riding
hood
sure
bluebeard
admiringly
more
than
ever
you
the
first
woman
met
who
has
been
afraid
of
me
riding
hood
surprised
are
you
very
alarming
wolves
frighten
me
sometimes
but
not
just
silly
men
giving
him
her
hand
all
right
then
but
you
do
what
i
said
bluebeard
beloved
one
i
will
do
anything
for
you
crusoe
and
goldilocks
come
back
probably
it
will
occur
to
the
four
of
them
to
sing
a
song
indicative
of
the
happy
family
life
awaiting
them
on
the
other
hand
they
may
prefer
to
dance
but
enough
of
this
let
us
get
on
to
the
great
event
of
the
evening
ladies
and
gentlemen
are
you
all
assembled
then
silence
please
for
father
christmas
father
christmas
ladies
and
gentlemen
it
gives
me
great
pleasure
to
see
you
here
at
my
court
this
evening
and
in
particular
my
friends
and
hubbard
of
whom
i
have
been
too
long
neglectful
however
i
hope
to
make
up
for
it
to
an
usher
disclose
the
christmas
tree
the
christmas
tree
is
disclosed
and
what
do
you
think
children
disguised
as
crackers
are
hanging
from
every
branch
well
i
never
father
christmas
quite
calmly
distribute
the
presents
an
usher
takes
down
the
children
one
by
one
and
places
them
in
a
row
reading
from
the
labels
on
them
hubbard
hubbard
alternately
usher
handing
list
to
hubbard
here
is
the
nominal
roll
sir
hubbard
looking
at
it
in
amazement
what
this
hubbard
looks
over
his
shoulder
ada
bertram
caroline
my
darling
one
hubbard
henry
our
children
at
last
oh
are
they
all
there
hubbard
we
soon
see
dear
ada
ada
springing
to
attention
father
she
stands
at
ease
hubbard
bertram
and
so
on
up
to
elsie
frank
frank
father
hubbard
there
you
are
darling
i
told
you
he
had
curly
brown
hair
gwendoline
and
so
on
hubbard
to
father
christmas
oh
thank
you
so
much
it
is
sweet
of
you
hubbard
to
father
christmas
we
are
slightly
overcome
do
you
mind
if
we
just
dance
it
off
father
christmas
nods
genially
come
on
children
he
holds
out
his
hands
and
he
and
his
wife
and
the
children
dance
round
in
a
ring
singing
here
we
go
round
the
christmas
tree
all
on
a
christmas
evening
and
then
but
at
this
moment
james
and
rosemary
and
the
hubbard
children
stopped
thinking
so
of
course
the
play
came
to
an
end
and
if
there
were
one
or
two
bits
in
it
which
the
children
did
quite
understand
that
was
james
fault
he
never
ought
to
have
been
thinking
at
all
really
pim
passes
by
a
comedy
in
three
acts
characters
george
marden
olivia
his
wife
dinah
his
niece
lady
marden
his
aunt
brian
strange
carraway
pim
anne
the
first
performance
of
this
play
in
london
took
place
at
the
new
theatre
on
january
with
the
following
cast
george
marden
ben
webster
olivia
irene
vanbrugh
dinah
georgette
cohan
lady
marden
ethel
griffies
brian
strange
leslie
howard
carraway
pim
dion
boucicault
anne
ethel
wellesley
pim
passes
by
act
i
the
at
marden
house
buckinghamshire
decided
more
than
a
hundred
years
ago
that
it
was
all
right
and
has
not
bothered
about
itself
since
visitors
to
the
house
have
called
the
result
such
different
adjectives
as
mellow
charming
even
baronial
and
antique
but
nobody
ever
said
it
was
exciting
sometimes
olivia
wants
it
to
be
more
exciting
and
last
week
she
let
herself
go
over
some
new
curtains
at
present
they
are
folded
up
and
waiting
for
her
she
still
has
the
rings
to
put
on
it
is
obvious
that
the
curtains
alone
will
overdo
the
excitement
they
will
have
to
be
harmonised
with
a
new
carpet
and
cushions
olivia
has
her
eye
on
just
the
things
but
one
has
to
go
carefully
with
george
what
was
good
enough
for
his
is
good
enough
for
him
however
we
can
trust
olivia
to
see
him
through
it
although
it
may
take
time
there
are
two
ways
of
coming
into
the
room
by
the
open
windows
leading
from
the
terrace
or
by
the
door
on
this
pleasant
july
morning
pim
chooses
the
latter
way
or
rather
anne
chooses
it
for
him
and
old
pim
wistful
kindly
gentle
little
pim
living
in
some
world
of
his
own
whither
we
can
not
follow

letter

forgotten

stupid
of

anne

out

wanders
about

room
humming
to

and
looking
vaguely
at
the
pictures
he
has
his
back
to
the
door
as
dinah

in

a
widow
called
telworthy
that
olivia
so
she
became
my
aunt
olivia
only
she
lets
me
drop
the
aunt
got
that
pim
a
little
alarmed
i
i
think
so
miss
marden
dinah
admiringly
i
say
you
quick
pim
well
if
you
take
my
advice
when
you
finished
your
business
with
george
you
will
hang
about
a
bit
and
see
if
you
ca
see
olivia
she
simply
devastating
i
do
wonder
george
fell
in
love
with
her
pim
it
only
the
merest
matter
of
business
just
a
few
minutes
with
your
uncle
i
afraid
i
shall
hardly
dinah
well
you
must
please
yourself
pim
i
just
giving
you
a
friendly
word
of
advice
naturally
i
was
awfully
glad
to
get
such
a
magnificent
aunt
because
of
course
marriage
rather
a
toss
up
is
it
and
george
might
have
gone
off
with
anybody
it
different
on
the
stage
where
guardians
always
marry
their
wards
but
george
could
marry
because
i
his
niece
mind
you
i
do
say
that
i
should
have
had
him
because
between
ourselves
he
a
little
bit
pim
so
he
married
er
marden
instead
dinah
telworthy
do
say
you
forgotten
already
just
when
you
were
getting
so
good
at
names
telworthy
you
see
olivia
married
the
telworthy
man
and
went
to
australia
with
him
and
he
drank
himself
to
death
in
the
bush
or
wherever
you
drink
yourself
to
death
out
there
and
olivia
came
home
to
england
and
met
my
uncle
and
he
fell
in
love
with
her
and
proposed
to
her
and
he
came
into
my
room
that
night
i
was
about
fourteen
and
turned
on
the
light
and
said
dinah
how
would
you
like
to
have
a
beautiful
aunt
of
your
very
own
and
i
said
congratulations
george
that
was
the
first
time
i
called
him
george
of
course
i
seen
it
coming
for
telworthy
is
it
a
funny
name
pim
very
singular
from
australia
you
say
dinah
yes
i
always
say
that
he
probably
still
alive
and
will
turn
up
here
one
morning
and
annoy
george
because
that
what
first
husbands
always
do
in
books
but
i
afraid
there
not
much
chance
pim
shocked
miss
marden
dinah
well
of
course
i
do
really
it
to
happen
but
it
be
rather
exciting
would
it
however
things
like
that
never
seem
to
occur
down
here
somehow
there
was
a
burnt
last
year
about
a
mile
away
but
that
is
quite
the
same
thing
is
it
pim
no
i
should
say
that
that
was
certainly
different
dinah
of
course
something
very
very
wonderful
did
happen
last
night
but
i
not
sure
if
i
know
you
well
enough
she
looks
at
him
hesitatingly
pim
uncomfortably
really
miss
marden
i
am
only
a
a
here
and
gone
you
really
must
dinah
and
yet
there
something
about
you
pim
which
inspires
confidence
the
fact
is
in
a
stage
whisper
i
got
engaged
last
night
pim
dear
me
let
me
congratulate
you
dinah
i
expect
that
why
george
is
keeping
you
such
a
long
time
brian
my
young
man
the
painter
only
nobody
has
ever
heard
of
him
he
smoking
a
pipe
with
george
in
the
library
and
asking
for
his
niece
hand
is
it
exciting
you
really
rather
lucky
pim
i
mean
being
told
so
soon
even
olivia
does
know
yet
pim
getting
up
yes
yes
i
congratulate
you
miss
marden
perhaps
it
would
be
better
anne
comes
in
anne
marden
is
out
at
the
moment
sir
oh
i
did
see
you
miss
dinah
dinah
it
all
right
anne
looking
after
pim
anne
yes
miss
she
goes
out
dinah
excitedly
that
me
they
ca
discuss
me
in
the
library
without
breaking
down
so
they
walking
up
and
down
outside
and
slashing
at
the
thistles
in
order
to
conceal
their
emotion
know
i
expect
brian
pim
looking
at
his
watch
yes
i
think
miss
marden
i
had
better
go
now
and
return
a
little
later
i
have
a
telegram
which
i
want
to
send
and
perhaps
by
the
time
i
came
back
dinah
oh
but
how
disappointing
of
you
when
we
were
getting
on
together
so
nicely
and
it
was
just
going
to
be
your
turn
to
tell
me
all
about
pim
i
have
really
nothing
to
tell
miss
marden
i
have
a
letter
of
introduction
to
marden
who
in
turn
will
give
me
i
hope
a
letter
to
a
certain
distinguished
man
whom
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
meet
that
is
all
holding
out
his
hand
and
now
miss
marden
dinah
oh
i
start
you
on
your
way
to
the
post
office
i
want
to
know
if
you
married
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
you
got
heaps
to
tell
me
pim
have
you
got
your
hat
that
right
then
we
hullo
here
brian
brian
strange
comes
in
at
the
windows
he
is
what
george
calls
a
damned
futuristic
aged
to
look
at
he
is
a
very
pleasant
boy
rather
untidily
dressed
brian
nodding
how
do
you
do
dinah
seizing
him
brian
this
is
pim
carraway
pim
been
telling
me
all
about
himself
it
so
interesting
he
just
going
to
send
a
telegram
and
then
he
coming
back
again
pim
this
is
brian
know
brian
smiling
and
shaking
hands
how
do
you
do
dinah
pleadingly
you
mind
going
to
the
post
office
by
yourself
will
you
because
you
see
brian
and
i
she
looks
lovingly
at
brian
pim
because
they
are
so
young
miss
dinah
and
er
brian
i
have
only
come
into
your
lives
for
a
moment
and
it
is
probable
that
i
shall
now
pass
out
of
them
for
ever
but
you
will
allow
an
old
man
dinah
oh
not
old
pim
chuckling
happily
well
a
man
to
wish
you
both
every
happiness
in
the
years
that
you
have
before
you
he
disappears
gently
through
the
windows
dinah
brian
he
get
lost
if
he
goes
that
way
brian
going
to
the
windows
and
calling
after
him
round
to
the
left
sir
that
right
he
comes
back
into
the
room
rum
old
bird
who
is
he
dinah
darling
you
have
kissed
me
yet
brian
taking
her
in
his
arms
i
ought
to
but
then
one
never
ought
to
do
the
nice
things
dinah
why
ought
you
they
sit
on
the
sofa
together
brian
well
we
said
we
be
good
until
we
told
your
uncle
and
aunt
all
about
it
you
see
being
a
guest
in
their
house
dinah
but
darling
child
what
you
been
doing
all
this
morning
telling
george
brian
to
tell
george
dinah
nodding
yes
of
course
there
a
difference
brian
i
think
he
guessed
there
was
something
up
and
he
took
me
down
to
see
the
pigs
he
said
he
had
to
see
the
pigs
at
once
i
do
know
why
an
appointment
perhaps
and
we
talked
about
pigs
all
the
way
and
i
could
say
talking
about
pigs
i
want
to
marry
your
niece
dinah
with
mock
indignation
of
course
you
could
brian
no
well
you
see
how
it
was
and
then
when
we
finished
talking
about
pigs
we
started
talking
the
pigs
dinah
eagerly
oh
is
arnold
brian
the
little
one
he
very
jolly
i
believe
but
naturally
i
was
thinking
about
him
much
i
was
wondering
how
to
begin
and
then
lumsden
came
up
and
wanted
to
talk
and
the
atmosphere
grew
less
and
less
romantic
and
and
i
gradually
drifted
away
dinah
poor
darling
well
we
shall
have
to
approach
him
through
olivia
brian
but
i
always
wanted
to
tell
her
first
she
so
much
easier
only
you
would
let
me
dinah
that
fault
brian
you
would
tell
olivia
that
she
ought
to
have
curtains
brian
but
she
curtains
dinah
yes
but
george
says
he
not
going
to
have
any
futuristic
nonsense
in
an
honest
english
country
house
which
has
been
good
enough
for
his
father
and
his
grandfather
and
his
and
and
all
the
rest
of
them
so
there
a
sort
of
strained
feeling
between
olivia
and
george
just
now
and
if
olivia
were
to
sort
of
recommend
you
well
it
would
do
you
much
good
brian
looking
at
her
i
see
of
course
i
know
what
want
dinah
dinah
what
do
i
want
brian
you
want
a
secret
engagement
and
notes
left
under
and
meetings
by
the
withered
thorn
when
all
the
household
is
asleep
know
you
dinah
oh
but
it
is
such
fun
i
love
meeting
people
by
withered
thorns
brian
well
i
not
going
to
have
it
dinah
childishly
oh
george
look
at
us
being
husbandy
brian
you
babe
i
adore
you
he
kisses
her
and
holds
her
away
from
him
and
looks
at
her
you
know
you
rather
throwing
yourself
away
on
me
do
you
mind
dinah
not
a
bit
brian
we
shall
never
be
rich
but
we
shall
have
lots
of
fun
and
meet
interesting
people
and
feel
that
we
doing
something
worth
doing
and
not
getting
paid
nearly
enough
for
it
and
we
can
curse
the
academy
together
and
the
british
public
and
oh
it
an
exciting
life
dinah
seeing
it
i
shall
love
it
brian
i
make
you
love
it
you
sha
be
sorry
dinah
dinah
you
sha
be
sorry
either
brian
brian
looking
at
her
lovingly
oh
i
know
i
sha
what
will
olivia
think
about
it
will
she
be
surprised
dinah
she
never
surprised
she
always
seems
to
have
thought
of
things
about
a
week
before
they
happen
george
just
begins
to
get
hold
of
them
about
a
week
they
happened
considering
him
after
all
there
no
reason
why
george
like
you
darling
brian
i
not
his
sort
you
know
dinah
you
more
olivia
sort
well
we
tell
olivia
this
morning
olivia
coming
in
and
what
are
you
going
to
tell
olivia
this
morning
she
looks
at
them
with
a
smile
oh
well
i
think
i
can
guess
shall
we
describe
olivia
but
you
will
know
all
about
her
before
the
day
is
over
dinah
jumping
up
olivia
darling
brian
following
say
you
understand
marden
olivia
marden
i
am
afraid
is
a
very
dense
person
brian
but
i
think
if
you
asked
olivia
if
she
understood
brian
bless
you
olivia
i
knew
you
be
on
our
side
dinah
of
course
she
would
olivia
i
do
know
if
it
usual
to
kiss
an
brian
but
dinah
is
such
a
very
special
sort
of
niece
that
she
inclines
her
cheek
and
brian
kisses
it
dinah
i
say
you
in
luck
brian
olivia
going
over
to
her
chair
by
the
and
getting
to
business
with
the
curtains
and
how
many
people
have
been
told
the
good
news
brian
nobody
yet
dinah
except
pim
brian
oh
does
olivia
who
pim
dinah
oh
he
just
happened
i
say
are
those
curtains
then
you
going
to
have
them
after
all
olivia
with
an
air
of
surprise
after
all
what
but
i
decided
on
them
long
ago
to
brian
you
have
told
george
yet
brian
i
began
to
you
know
but
i
never
got
any
farther
than
er
there
just
er
dinah
george

about
pigs
all
the
time
olivia
well
i
suppose
you
want
me
to
help
you
dinah

darling
brian
it
would
be
awfully
decent
of
you
of
course
i
not
quite
his
sort
really
dinah
you
sort
brian
but
i
do
think
he
objects
to
me
and
george
comes
in
a
typical
honest
country
gentleman
of
forty
odd
george
at
the
windows
what

about

pim

kicks
some
of
the
mud
off
his
boots
who

he
where

i
had
most
important
business
with
lumsden
and
the
girl
comes
down
and
cackles
about
a
pim
or
ping
or
something
where
did
i
put
his
card
bringing
it
out

his
eyebrows

brian
stepping
out
i
been
wanting
to
tell

this
morning

only
i
did
seem
to
have
an
opportunity
of
getting
it
out
george
well
what
is
it
brian
i
want
to
marry
dinah
sir
george
you
want
to
marry

my
soul
dinah
rushing
to
him
and
putting
her
cheek
against
his
coat
oh
do
say
you
like
the
idea
uncle
george
george
like
the
idea
have
you
heard
of
this
nonsense
olivia
olivia
they
just
this
moment
told
me
george
i
think
they
would
be
happy
together
george
to
brian
and
what
do
you
propose
to
be
happy
together
brian
well
of
course
it
does
amount
to
much
at
present
but
we
sha
starve
dinah
brian
got
fifty
pounds
for
a
picture
last
march
george
a
little
upset
by
this
oh
recovering
gamely
and
how
many
pictures
have
you
sold
since
brian
well
none
but
george
none
and
i
do
wonder
who
the
devil
is
going
to
buy
pictures
with
triangular
clouds
and
square
sheep
and
they
call
that
art
nowadays
good
god
man
waving
him
to
the
windows
go
outside
and
at
the
clouds
olivia
if
he
draws
round
clouds
in
future
george
will
you
let
him
marry
dinah
george
what
what
yes
of
course
you
be
on
his
side
all
this
futuristic
nonsense
i
just
taking
these
clouds
as
an
example
i
suppose
i
can
see
as
well
as
any
man
in
the
county
and
i
say
that
clouds
triangular
brian
after
all
sir
at
my
age
one
is
naturally
experimenting
and
trying
to
find
one
with
a
laugh
well
it
sounds
priggish
but
one
medium
of
expression
i
shall
find
out
what
i
want
to
do
directly
but
i
think
i
shall
always
be
able
to
earn
enough
to
live
on
well
i
have
for
the
last
three
years
george
i
see
and
now
you
want
to
experiment
with
a
wife
and
you
propose
to
start
experimenting
with
niece
brian
with
a
shrug
well
of
course
if
you
olivia
you
could
help
the
experiment
darling
by
giving
dinah
a
good
allowance
until
she
george
help
the
experiment
i
do
to
help
the
experiment
olivia
apologetically
oh
i
thought
you
did
george
you
will
talk
as
if
i
was
made
of
money
what
with
taxes
always
going
up
and
rents
always
going
down
it
as
much
as
we
can
do
to
rub
along
as
we
are
without
making
allowances
to
everybody
who
thinks
she
wants
to
get
married
to
brian
and
that
thanks
to
you
my
friend
brian
surprised
to
me
olivia
you
never
told
me
darling
what
brian
been
doing
dinah
indignantly
he
has
been
doing
anything
george
he
one
of
your
socialists
who
go
turning
the
country
upside
down
olivia
but
even
socialists
must
get
married
sometimes
george
i
do
see
any
necessity
olivia
but
you
have
nobody
to
damn
after
dinner
darling
if
they
all
died
out
brian
really
sir
i
do
see
what
my
politics
and
my
art
have
got
to
do
with
it
i
perfectly
ready
not
to
talk
about
either
when
in
your
house
and
as
dinah
does
seem
to
object
to
them
dinah
i
should
think
she
does
george
oh
you
can
get
round
the
women
i
daresay
brian
well
it
dinah
i
want
to
marry
and
live
with
so
what
it
really
comes
to
is
that
you
do
think
i
can
support
a
wife
george
well
if
you
going
to
do
it
by
selling
pictures
i
think
you
can
brian
all
right
tell
me
how
much
you
want
me
to
earn
in
a
year
and
i
earn
it
george
hedging
it
is
merely
a
question
of
money
i
just
mention
that
as
one
thing
one
of
the
important
things
in
addition
to
that
i
think
you
are
both
too
young
to
marry
i
do
think
you
know
your
own
minds
and
i
am
not
at
all
persuaded
that
with
what
i
venture
to
call
your
outrageous
tastes
you
and
my
niece
will
live
happily
together
just
because
she
thinks
she
loves
you
dinah
may
persuade
herself
now
that
she
agrees
with
all
you
say
and
do
but
she
has
been
properly
brought
up
in
an
honest
english
country
household
and
er
she
well
in
short
i
can
not
at
all
approve
of
any
engagement
between
you
getting
up
olivia
if
this
er
pim
comes
i
shall
be
down
at
the
farm
you
might
send
him
along
to
me
he
walks
towards
the
windows
brian
indignantly
is
there
any
reason
why
i
should
marry
a
girl
who
has
been
properly
brought
up
george
i
think
you
know
my
views
strange
olivia
george
wait
a
moment
dear
we
ca
quite
leave
it
like
this
george
i
have
said
all
i
want
to
say
on
the
subject
olivia
yes
darling
but
i
have
begun
to
say
all
that
want
to
say
on
the
subject
george
of
course
if
you
have
anything
to
say
olivia
i
will
listen
to
it
but
i
do
know
that
this
is
quite
the
time
or
that
you
have
chosen
looking
darkly
at
the
curtains
quite
the
occupation
likely
to
er
endear
your
views
to
me
dinah
mutinously
i
may
as
well
tell
you
uncle
george
that
have
got
a
good
deal
to
say
too
olivia
i
can
guess
what
you
are
going
to
say
dinah
and
i
think
you
had
better
keep
it
for
the
moment
dinah
meekly
yes
aunt
olivia
olivia
brian
you
might
take
her
outside
for
a
walk
i
expect
you
have
plenty
to
talk
about
george
now
mind
strange
no
i
put
you
on
your
honour
about
that
brian
i
do
my
best
to
avoid
it
sir
dinah
cheekily
may
i
take
his
arm
if
we
go
up
a
hill
olivia
i
sure
you
know
how
to
behave
both
of
you
brian
come
on
then
dinah
dinah
righto
george
as
they
go
and
if
you
do
see
any
clouds
strange
take
a
good
look
at
them
he
chuckles
to
himself
triangular
clouds
i
never
heard
of
such
nonsense
he
goes
back
to
his
chair
at
the
futuristic
rubbish
well
olivia
olivia
well
george
george
what
are
you
doing
olivia
making
curtains
george
wo
they
be
rather
sweet
oh
but
i
forgot
you
do
like
them
george
i
do
like
them
and
what
is
more
i
do
mean
to
have
them
in
my
house
as
i
told
you
yesterday
this
is
the
house
of
a
simple
country
gentleman
and
i
do
want
any
of
these
ideas
in
it
olivia
is
marrying
for
love
a
idea
george
we
come
to
that
directly
none
of
you
women
can
keep
to
the
point
what
i
am
saying
now
is
that
the
house
of
my
fathers
and
forefathers
is
good
enough
for
me
olivia
do
you
know
george
i
can
hear
one
of
your
ancestors
saying
that
to
his
wife
in
their
smelly
old
cave
when
the
idea
of
building
houses
was
first
suggested
the
cave
of
my
fathers
is
george
that
ridiculous
naturally
we
must
have
progress
but
just
the
point
indicating
the
curtains
i
do
call
this
sort
of
thing
progress
it
ah
retrogression
olivia
well
anyhow
it
pretty
george
there
i
disagree
with
you
and
i
must
say
once
more
that
i
will
not
have
them
hanging
in
my
house
olivia
very
well
george
but
she
goes
on
working
george
that
being
so
i
do
see
the
necessity
of
going
on
with
them
olivia
well
i
must
do
something
with
them
now
i
got
the
material
i
thought
perhaps
i
could
sell
them
when
they
finished
as
we
so
poor
george
what
do
you
mean
so
poor
olivia
well
you
said
just
now
that
you
could
give
dinah
an
allowance
because
rents
had
gone
down
george
annoyed
confound
it
olivia
keep
to
the
point
we
talk
about
dinah
affairs
directly
we
discussing
our
own
affairs
at
the
moment
olivia
but
what
is
there
to
discuss
george
those
ridiculous
things
olivia
but
we
finished
that
you
said
you
would
have
them
hanging
in
your
house
and
i
said
very
well
george
now
we
can
go
on
to
dinah
and
brian
george
shouting
but
put
these
beastly
things
away
olivia
rising
and
gathering
up
the
curtains
very
well
george
she
puts
them
away
slowly
gracefully
there
is
an
uncomfortable
silence
evidently
somebody
ought
to
apologise
george
realising
that
he
is
the
one
er
look
here
olivia
old
girl
you
been
a
jolly
good
wife
to
me
and
we
do
often
have
rows
and
if
i
been
rude
to
you
about
this
lost
my
temper
a
bit
perhaps
what
i
say
i
sorry
may
i
have
a
kiss
olivia
holding
up
her
face
george
darling
he
kisses
her
do
you
love
me
george
you
know
i
do
old
girl
olivia
as
much
as
brian
loves
dinah
george
stiffly
i
said
all
i
want
to
say
about
that
he
goes
away
from
her
olivia
oh
but
there
must
be
lots
you
want
to
say
and
perhaps
like
to
do
tell
me
darling
george
what
it
comes
to
is
this
i
consider
that
dinah
is
too
young
to
choose
a
husband
for
herself
and
that
strange
is
the
husband
i
should
choose
for
her
olivia
you
were
calling
him
brian
yesterday
george
yesterday
i
regarded
him
as
a
boy
now
he
wants
me
to
look
upon
him
as
a
man
olivia
he
george
and
dinah
nineteen
ridiculous
olivia
if
he
been
a
conservative
and
thought
that
clouds
were
round
i
suppose
he
have
seemed
older
somehow
george
that
a
different
point
altogether
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
his
age
olivia
innocently
oh
i
thought
it
had
george
what
i
am
objecting
to
is
these
ridiculously
early
marriages
before
either
party
knows
its
own
mind
much
less
the
mind
of
the
other
party
such
marriages
invariably
lead
to
unhappiness
olivia
of
course
first
marriage
was
a
happy
one
george
as
you
know
olivia
i
dislike
speaking
about
your
first
marriage
at
all
and
i
had
no
intention
of
bringing
it
up
now
but
since
you
mention
it
well
that
is
a
case
in
point
olivia
looking
back
at
it
when
i
was
eighteen
i
was
in
love
or
perhaps
i
only
thought
i
was
and
i
do
know
if
i
should
have
been
happy
or
not
if
i
had
married
him
but
my
father
made
me
marry
a
man
called
jacob
telworthy
and
when
things
were
too
hot
for
him
in
england
too
hot
for
him
i
think
that
was
the
expression
we
used
in
those
days
then
we
went
to
australia
and
i
left
him
there
and
the
only
happy
moment
i
had
in
all
my
married
life
was
on
the
morning
when
i
saw
in
the
papers
that
he
was
dead
george
very
uncomfortable
yes
yes
my
dear
i
know
you
must
have
had
a
terrible
time
i
can
hardly
bear
to
think
about
it
my
only
hope
is
that
i
have
made
up
to
you
for
it
in
some
degree
but
i
do
see
what
bearing
it
has
upon
dinah
case
olivia
oh
none
except
that
father
jacob
political
opinions
and
his
views
on
art
i
expect
that
that
was
why
he
chose
him
for
me
george
you
seem
to
think
that
i
wish
to
choose
a
husband
for
dinah
i
do
at
all
let
her
choose
whom
she
likes
as
long
as
he
can
support
her
and
there
a
chance
of
their
being
happy
together
now
with
regard
to
this
fellow
olivia
you
mean
brian
george
he
got
no
money
and
he
been
brought
up
in
quite
a
different
way
from
dinah
dinah
may
be
prepared
to
believe
that
er
all
cows
are
blue
and
that
er
waves
are
square
but
she
wo
go
on
believing
it
for
ever
olivia
neither
will
brian
george
well
that
what
i
keep
telling
him
only
he
wo
see
it
just
as
i
keep
telling
you
about
those
ridiculous
curtains
it
seems
to
me
that
i
am
the
only
person
in
the
house
with
any
eyesight
left
olivia
perhaps
you
are
darling
but
you
must
let
us
find
out
our
own
mistakes
for
ourselves
at
any
rate
brian
is
a
gentleman
he
loves
dinah
dinah
loves
him
he
earning
enough
to
support
himself
and
you
are
earning
enough
to
support
dinah
i
think
it
worth
risking
george
george
stiffly
i
can
only
say
the
whole
question
demands
much
more
anxious
thought
than
you
seem
to
have
given
it
you
say
that
he
is
a
gentleman
he
knows
how
to
behave
i
admit
but
if
his
morals
are
as
as
his
tastes
and
er
politics
as
i
no
doubt
they
are
then
er
in
short
i
do
approve
of
brian
strange
as
a
husband
for
my
niece
and
ward
olivia
looking
at
him
thoughtfully
you
a
curious
mixture
george
you
were
so
very
unconventional
when
you
married
me
and
you
so
very
conventional
when
brian
wants
to
marry
dinah
george
marden
to
marry
the
widow
of
a
convict
george
convict
what
do
you
mean
olivia
jacob
telworthy
convict
i
forget
his
number
surely
i
told
you
all
this
dear
when
we
got
engaged
george
never
olivia
i
told
you
how
he
carelessly
put
the
wrong
signature
to
a
cheque
for
a
thousand
pounds
in
england
how
he
made
a
little
mistake
about
two
or
three
companies
he
promoted
in
australia
and
how
george
yes
yes
but
you
never
told
me
he
was
olivia
what
difference
does
it
make
george
my
dear
olivia
if
you
ca
see
that
a
convict
olivia
so
you
see
we
need
be
too
particular
about
our
niece
need
we
george
i
think
we
had
better
leave
your
first
husband
out
of
the
conversation
altogether
i
never
wished
to
refer
to
him
i
never
wish
to
hear
about
him
again
i
certainly
had
not
realised
that
he
was
actually
er
for
his
er
olivia
mistakes
george
well
we
need
go
into
that
as
for
this
other
matter
i
do
for
a
moment
take
it
seriously
dinah
is
an
exceptionally
pretty
girl
and
young
strange
is
a
boy
if
they
are
attracted
to
each
other
it
is
a
mere
outward
attraction
which
i
am
convinced
will
not
lead
to
any
lasting
happiness
that
must
be
regarded
as
my
last
word
in
the
matter
olivia
if
this
er
what
was
his
name
comes
i
shall
be
down
at
the
farm
he
goes
out
by
the
door
left
alone
olivia
brings
out
her
curtains
again
and
gets
calmly
to
work
upon
them
dinah
and
brian
come
in
by
the
windows
dinah
finished
olivia
oh
no
i
got
all
these
rings
to
put
on
dinah
i
meant
talking
to
george
brian
we
walked
about
outside
dinah
until
we
heard
him
talking
to
you
any
more
brian
and
we
did
kiss
each
other
once
dinah
brian
was
very
he
would
even
let
me
tickle
the
back
of
his
neck
she
goes
up
suddenly
to
olivia
and
kneels
by
her
and
kisses
her
darling
being
is
a
very
nice
thing
to
be
i
mean
a
nice
thing
for
other
people
to
be
i
mean
oh
you
know
what
i
mean
but
say
that
he
going
to
be
decent
about
it
olivia
of
course
he
is
dinah
brian
you
mean
he
let
me
come
here
as
as
dinah
as
my
young
man
olivia
oh
i
think
so
dinah
olivia
you
a
wonder
have
you
really
talked
him
round
olivia
i
have
said
anything
yet
but
i
daresay
i
shall
think
of
something
dinah
disappointedly
oh
brian
making
the
best
of
it
after
all
dinah
i
going
back
to
london
olivia
you
can
be
good
for
one
more
day
dinah
and
then
when
brian
is
here
we
see
what
we
can
do
dinah
yes
but
i
did
want
him
to
go
back
brian
sternly

of
seeing
all
that
you
want
to
see
he
a
very
old
friend
of
mine
taking
a
sheet
of
notepaper
stay
to
lunch
of
course

afraid

lunching
with
the

after

right
good
chap
trevor
pim
to
olivia

see
marden
i
have
only
recently
arrived
from
australia
after
travelling
about
the
world
for
some
years
and
i
rather
out
of
touch
with
my
er
in
london
olivia
oh
yes

been
in
australia
pim
george
disliking
australia
i
sha
be
a
moment

he
frowns
at
olivia
pim
oh

thank
you
to

i
have
been
in

more
than
once
in
the
last
few
years
olivia
really
i
used
to
live
at
sydney
many
years
ago
do
you
know
sydney
at
all
george
detesting
sydney
perhaps
i
better
mention
that
you
are
a
friend
of
the
trevors
pim
thank
you
thank
you
to
olivia
indeed
yes
i
spent
several
months
in
sydney
olivia
how
curious
i
wonder
if
we
have
any
friends
in
common
there
george
hastily
extremely
unlikely
i
should
think
sydney
is
a
very
big
place
pim
true
but
the
world
is
a
very
small
place
marden
i
had
a
remarkable
instance
of
that
coming
over
on
the
boat
this
last
time
george
ah
feeling
that
the
conversation
is
now
safe
he
resumes
his
letter
pim
yes
there
was
a
man
i
used
to
employ
in
sydney
some
years
ago
a
bad
fellow
i
afraid
marden
who
had
been
in
prison
for
some
kind
of
fraudulent
and
had
taken
to
drink
and
and
so
on
olivia
yes
yes
i
understand
pim
drinking
himself
to
death
i
should
have
said
i
gave
him
at
the
most
another
year
to
live
yet
to
my
amazement
the
first
person
i
saw
as
i
stepped
on
board
the
boat
that
brought
me
to
england
last
week
was
this
fellow
there
was
no
mistaking
him
i
spoke
to
him
in
fact
we
recognised
each
other
olivia
really
pim
he
was
travelling
steerage
we
did
meet
again
on
board
and
as
it
happened
at
marseilles
this
poor
fellow
er
now
what
his
name
a
very
unusual
one
began
with
a
a
t
i
think
olivia
with
suppressed
feeling
yes
pim
yes
she
puts
out
a
hand
to
george

in
an
undertone
nonsense
dear
pim
triumphantly
i
got
it
telworthy
olivia

a
little
surprised
at
the
success
of
his
story
an
unusual
name
is
it
not
not
a
name
you
could
forget
when
once
you
had
heard
it
olivia
with
feeling
no
it
is
not
a
name
you
could
forget
when
once
you
had
heard
it
george
hastily
coming
over
to
pim
quite
so
pim
a
most
remarkable
name
a
most
odd
story
altogether
well
well

letter

i
afraid

i
just
see
you
on
your
way
to
olivia
er
my
dear
olivia
holding
out
her
hand
but
not
looking
at
him
pim
pim
george
leading
the
way
through
the
windows
this
way
this
way
quicker
for
you
pim
thank
you
thank
you
george
hurries
pim
out
olivia
sits
there
and
looks
into
the
past
now
and
then
she
shudders
george
comes
back
george
good
god
telworthy
is
it
possible
before
olivia
can
answer
lady
marden
is
announced
they
pull
themselves
together
and
greet
her
act
ii
lunch
is
over
and
coffee
has
been
served
on
the
terrace
conversation
drags
on
to
the
satisfaction
of
lady
marden
but
of
nobody
else
george
and
olivia
want
to
be
alone
so
do
brian
and
dinah
at
last
brian
murmurs
something
about
a
and
catching
eye
comes
into
the
house
he
leans
against
the
sofa
and
waits
for
dinah
dinah
loudly
as
she
comes
in
have
you
found
it
brian
found
what
dinah
in
her
ordinary
voice
that
was
just
for
benefit
i
said
i
help
you
find
it
it
your
we
looking
for
is
it
brian
taking
it
out
yes
have
one
dinah
no
thank
you
darling
aunt
still
thinks
unladylike
have
you
ever
seen
her
beagling
brian
no
is
that
very
ladylike
dinah
very
i
say
what
has
happened
do
you
think
brian
everything
i
love
you
and
you
love
me
dinah
silly
i
meant
between
george
and
olivia
did
you
notice
them
at
lunch
brian
i
noticed
that
you
seemed
to
be
doing
most
of
the
talking
but
then
i
noticed
that
before
sometimes
do
you
think
olivia
and
your
uncle
have
quarrelled
because
of
dinah
of
course
not
george
may
he
has
quarrelled
but
quite
sure
olivia
has
no
i
believe
pim
at
the
bottom
of
it
he
brought
some
terribly
sad
news
about
george
investments
the
old
home
will
have
to
be
sold
up
brian
good
then
your
uncle
wo
mind
your
marrying
me
dinah
yes
darling
but
you
must
be
more
dramatic
about
it
than
that
george
you
must
say
with
tears
in
your
eyes
i
can
not
pay
off
the
whole
of
the
mortgage
for
you
i
have
only
two
and
ninepence
but
at
least
let
me
take
your
niece
off
your
hands
then
george
will
thump
you
on
the
back
and
say
gruffly
you
a
good
fellow
brian
a
damn
good
fellow
and
he
blow
his
nose
very
loudly
and
say
confound
this
cigar
it
wo
draw
properly
she
gives
us
a
rough
impression
of
george
doing
it
brian
dinah
you
a
heavenly
idiot
and
you
simply
got
to
marry
me
uncles
or
no
uncles
dinah
it
will
have
to
be
uncles
i
afraid
because
you
see
his
ward
and
i
can
get
sent
to
chancery
or
coventry
or
somewhere
beastly
if
i
marry
without
his
consent
have
got
anybody
who
objects
to
your
marrying
brian
nobody
thank
heaven
dinah
well
that
rather
disappointing
of
you
i
saw
myself
fascinating
your
aged
father
at
the
same
time
that
you
were
fascinating
george
i
should
have
done
it
much
better
than
you
as
a
you
are
very
successful
sweetheart
brian
what
am
i
like
as
a
dinah
plus
six
darling
brian
then
i
stick
to
that
and
leave
george
to
olivia
dinah
i
expect
she
manage
him
all
right
i
have
great
faith
in
olivia
but
you
marry
me
anyhow
wo
you
brian
brian
i
will
dinah
even
if
we
have
to
wait
till
i
brian
even
if
we
have
to
wait
till
you
dinah
holding
out
her
hands
to
him
darling
brian
uneasily
i
say
do
do
that
dinah
why
not
brian
well
i
promised
i
would
kiss
you
dinah
oh
well
you
might
just
me
a
kiss
you
can
look
the
other
way
as
if
you
did
know
i
was
here
brian
like
this
he
looks
the
other
way
kisses
the
tips
of
his
fingers
and
flicks
it
carelessly
in
her
direction
dinah
that
was
a
lovely
one
now
here
one
coming
for
you
he
catches
it
gracefully
and
conveys
it
to
his
mouth
brian
with
a
low
bow
madam
i
thank
you
dinah
curtseying
your
servant
mr
strange
olivia
from
outside
dinah
dinah
jumping
up
hullo
olivia
comes
in
through
the
windows
followed
by
george
and
lady
marden
the
latter
a
vigorous
young
woman
of
sixty
odd
who
always
looks
as
if
she
were
beagling
olivia
aunt
julia
wants
to
see
the
pigs

i
wish
you

business

at
me
and
proud
of
it
olivia

aunt
julia

old
would
olivia
be
if
she
took
exercise
george
do
stand
about
asking
silly
questions
dinah
your
aunt
has
much
time
brian
may
i
come
too
lady
marden
lady
marden
well
a
little
exercise
would
do
any
harm
mr
strange
you
an
artist
ai
you
brian
well
i
try
to
paint
dinah
he
sold
a
picture
last
march
for
george
yes
yes
never
mind
that
now
lady
marden
unhealthy
life
well
come
along
she
strides
out
followed
by
dinah
and
brian
george
sits
down
at
his
desk
with
his
head
in
his
hand
and
stabs
the
with
a
pen
olivia
takes
the
curtains
with
her
to
the
sofa
and
begins
to
work
on
them
george
looking
up
and
seeing
them
really
olivia
we
got
something
more
important
more
vital
to
us
than
curtains
to
discuss
now
that
we
alone
at
last
olivia
i
was
going
to
discuss
them
dear
george
i
always
glad
to
see
aunt
julia
in
my
house
but
i
wish
she
had
chosen
this
day
of
all
days
to
come
to
lunch
olivia
it
was
aunt
julia
fault
it
was
really
pim
who
chose
the
wrong
day
george
fiercely
good
heavens
is
it
true
olivia
about
jacob
telworthy
george
you
told
me
he
was
dead
you
always
said
that
he
was
dead
you
you
olivia
well
i
always
thought
that
he
was
dead
he
was
as
dead
as
anybody
could
be
all
the
papers
said
he
was
dead
george
scornfully
the
papers
olivia
as
if
this
would
settle
it
for
george
the
said
he
was
dead
there
was
a
paragraph
about
him
apparently
even
his
death
was
fraudulent
george
yes
yes
i
not
blaming
you
olivia
but
what
are
we
going
to
do
that
the
question
what
are
we
going
to
do
my
god
horrible
you
never
been
married
to
me
at
all
you
do
seem
to
understand
olivia
it
is
a
little
difficult
to
realise
you
see
it
does
seem
to
have
made
any
difference
to
our
happiness
george
no
that
what
so
terrible
i
mean
well
of
course
we
were
quite
innocent
in
the
matter
but
at
the
same
time
nothing
can
get
over
the
fact
that
we
we
had
no
right
to
to
be
happy
olivia
would
you
rather
we
had
been
miserable
george
you
telworthy
wife
that
what
you
do
seem
to
understand
you
telworthy
wife
you
er
forgive
me
olivia
but
it
the
horrible
truth
you
committed
bigamy
when
you
married
me
in
horror
bigamy
olivia
it
is
an
ugly
word
is
it
george
yes
but
do
you
understand
he
jumps
up
and
comes
over
to
her
look
here
olivia
old
girl
the
whole
thing
is
nonsense
eh
it
is
your
husband
it
some
other
telworthy
that
this
fellow
met
that
right
is
it
some
other
shady
swindler
who
turned
up
on
the
boat
eh
this
sort
of
thing
does
happen
to
people
like
committing
bigamy
and
all
that
some
other
fellow
olivia
shaking
her
head
i
knew
all
the
shady
swindlers
in
sydney
george
they
came
to
dinner
there
were
no
others
called
telworthy
george
goes
back
despondently
to
his
seat
george
well
what
are
we
going
to
do
olivia
you
sent
pim
away
so
quickly
he
might
have
told
us
things
telworthy
plans
where
he
is
now
you
hurried
him
away
so
quickly
george
i
sent
a
note
round
to
ask
him
to
come
back
my
one
idea
at
the
moment
was
to
get
him
out
of
the
house
to
hush
things
up
olivia
you
ca
hush
up
two
husbands
george
in
despair
you
ca
everybody
will
know
everybody
olivia
the
children
aunt
julia
they
may
as
well
know
now
as
later
pim
must
of
course
george
i
do
not
propose
to
discuss
my
private
affairs
with
pim
olivia
but
he
mixed
himself
up
in
them
rather
has
he
and
if
you
going
to
ask
him
questions
george
i
only
propose
to
ask
him
one
question
i
shall
ask
him
if
he
is
absolutely
certain
of
the
man
name
i
can
do
that
quite
easily
without
letting
him
know
the
reason
for
my
inquiry
olivia
you
could
make
a
mistake
about
a
name
like
telworthy
but
he
might
tell
us
something
about
telworthy
plans
perhaps
he
going
back
to
australia
at
once
perhaps
he
thinks
i
dead
too
perhaps
oh
there
are
so
many
things
i
want
to
know
george
yes
yes
dear
it
would
be
interesting
to
that
is
one
naturally
wants
to
know
these
things
but
of
course
it
does
make
any
real
difference
olivia
surprised
no
difference
george
well
that
is
to
say
you
as
much
his
wife
if
he
in
australia
as
you
are
if
he
in
england
olivia
i
am
not
his
wife
at
all
george
but
olivia
surely
you
understand
the
position
olivia
shaking
her
head
jacob
telworthy
may
be
alive
but
i
am
not
his
wife
i
ceased
to
be
his
wife
when
i
became
yours
george
you
never
my
wife
that
is
the
terrible
part
of
it
our
union
you
make
me
say
it
olivia
has
been
unhallowed
by
the
church
unhallowed
even
by
the
law
legally
we
have
been
living
in
living
in
well
the
point
is
how
does
the
law
stand
i
imagine
that
telworthy
could
get
a
a
divorce
oh
it
seems
impossible
that
things
like
this
can
be
happening
to
olivia
joyfully
a
divorce
george
i
i
imagine
so
olivia
but
then
we
could
get
married
and
we
should
be
living
in
living
in
whatever
we
were
living
in
before
george
i
ca
understand
you
olivia
you
talk
about
it
so
calmly
as
if
there
was
nothing
blameworthy
in
being
divorced
as
if
there
was
nothing
unusual
in
my
marrying
a
divorced
woman
as
if
there
was
nothing
wrong
in
our
having
lived
together
for
years
without
having
been
married
olivia
what
seems
wrong
to
me
is
that
i
lived
for
five
years
with
a
bad
man
whom
i
hated
what
seems
right
to
me
is
that
i
lived
for
five
years
with
a
good
man
whom
i
love
george
yes
yes
my
dear
i
know
but
right
and
wrong
do
settle
themselves
as
easily
as
that
we
been
living
together
when
you
were
telworthy
wife
that
olivia
do
you
mean
wicked
george
well
no
doubt
the
court
would
consider
that
we
acted
in
perfect
innocence
olivia
what
court
george
these
things
have
to
be
done
legally
of
course
i
believe
the
proper
method
is
a
nullity
suit
declaring
our
marriage
null
and
er
void
it
would
so
to
speak
wipe
out
these
years
of
er
olivia
wickedness
george
of
irregular
union
and
er
then
olivia
then
i
could
go
back
to
jacob
do
you
really
mean
that
george
george
uneasily
well
dear
you
see
that
how
things
are
one
ca
get
away
from
er
olivia
what
you
feel
is
that
telworthy
has
the
greater
claim
you
are
prepared
to
make
way
for
him
george
both
the
church
and
the
law
would
say
that
i
had
no
claim
at
all
i
afraid
i
i
suppose
i
have
olivia
i
see
she
looks
at
him
curiously
thank
you
for
making
it
so
clear
george
george
of
course
whether
or
not
you
go
back
to
er
telworthy
is
another
matter
altogether
that
would
naturally
be
for
you
to
decide
olivia
cheerfully
for
me
and
jacko
to
decide
george
er
jacko
olivia
i
used
to
call
my
first
husband
i
mean
my
only
husband
jacko
i
did
like
the
name
of
jacob
and
jacko
seemed
to
suit
him
somehow
he
had
very
long
arms
dear
jacko
george
annoyed
you
do
seem
to
realise
that
this
is
not
a
joke
olivia
olivia
a
trifle
hysterically
it
may
not
be
a
joke
but
it
funny
is
it
george
i
must
say
i
do
see
anything
funny
in
a
tragedy
that
has
wrecked
two
lives
olivia
two
oh
but
jacko
life
is
wrecked
it
has
just
been
miraculously
restored
to
him
and
a
wife
too
there
nothing
tragic
for
jacko
in
it
george
stiffly
i
was
referring
to
two
lives
yours
and
mine
olivia
yours
george
your
life
is
wrecked
the
court
will
absolve
you
of
all
blame
your
friends
will
sympathise
with
you
and
tell
you
that
i
was
a
designing
woman
who
deliberately
took
you
in
your
aunt
julia
george
overwrought
stop
it
what
do
you
mean
have
you
no
heart
do
you
think
i
to
lose
you

you
think

my
home

up
like
this

you
been
happy
with
me
these
last
five
years
olivia
very
happy
george

how
can
you
talk
like
that
olivia
pathetically
but
you
want
to
send
me
away
george
there
you
go
again
i
do
to
i
have
hardly
had
time
to
realise
just
what
it
will
mean
to
me
when
you
go
the
fact
is
i
simply
dare
realise
it
i
dare
think
about
it
olivia
earnestly
try
thinking
about
it
george
george
and
you
talk
as
if
i
to
send
you
away
olivia
try
thinking
about
it
george
george
you
do
seem
to
understand
that
i
not
you
away
you
simply
are
mine
to
keep
olivia
whose
am
i
george
your
husband
telworthy
olivia
gently
if
i
belong
to
anybody
but
myself
i
think
i
belong
to
you
george
not
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
not
in
the
eyes
of
the
church
not
even
in
the
eyes
of
er
olivia
the
county
george
annoyed
i
was
about
to
say
heaven
olivia
unimpressed
oh
george
that
this
should
happen
to
he
gets
up
and
walks
about
the
room
wondering
when
he
will
wake
up
from
this
impossible
dream
olivia
works
in
silence
then
she
stands
up
and
shakes
out
her
curtains
olivia
looking
at
them
i
do
hope
jacko
will
like
these
george
what
you
going
up
to
her
olivia
olivia
have
you
no
heart
olivia
ought
you
to
talk
like
that
to
another
man
wife
george
confound
it
is
this
just
a
joke
to
you
olivia
you
must
forgive
me
george
i
am
a
little
at
the
thought
of
returning
to
jacob
i
suppose
george
do
you
to
return
to
him
olivia
one
wants
to
do
what
is
right
in
the
eyes
of
er
heaven
george
seeing
what
sort
of
man
he
is
i
have
no
doubt
that
you
could
get
a
separation
supposing
that
he
did
er
divorce
you
i
know
is
best
i
must
consult
my
solicitor
the
whole
position
has
been
sprung
on
us
and
miserably
i
do
know
i
do
know
i
ca
take
it
all
in
olivia
would
you
like
to
consult
your
aunt
julia
too
she
could
tell
you
what
the
county
i
mean
what
heaven
really
thought
about
it
george
yes
yes
aunt
julia
has
plenty
of
common
sense
you
quite
right
olivia
this
is
a
thing
we
can
keep
from
the
family
olivia
do
i
still
call
her
julia
george
looking
up
from
his
pacings
what
what
anne
comes
in
well
what
is
it
anne
pim
says
he
will
come
down
at
once
sir
george
oh
thank
you
thank
you
anne
goes
out
olivia
george
pim
has
got
to
know
george
i
do
see
the
necessity
olivia
not
even
for
me
when
a
woman
suddenly
hears
that
her
husband
is
restored
to
her
do
you
think
she
wants
to
ask
questions
where
is
he
living
and
how
is
he
looking
and
george
coldly
of
course
if
you
are
interested
in
these
things
olivia
how
can
i
help
being
do
be
so
silly
george
we
know
what
jacko
george
annoyed
i
wish
you
would
call
him
by
that
ridiculous
name
olivia
my
husband
george
wincing
yes
well
your
husband
olivia
well
we
must
know
his
plans
where
we
can
communicate
with
him
and
so
on
george
i
have
no
wish
to
communicate
with
him
olivia
i
afraid
you
have
to
dear
george
i
do
see
the
necessity
olivia
well
you
want
to
to
apologise
to
him
for
living
with
his
wife
for
so
long
and
as
i
belong
to
him
he
ought
to
be
told
where
he
can
call
for
me
george
after
a
struggle
you
put
it
in
a
very
peculiar
way
but
i
see
with
a
shudder
oh
the
horrible
publicity
of
it
all
olivia
going
up
to
him
and
comforting
him
poor
george
dear
think
i
do
sympathise
with
you
i
understand
so
exactly
what
you
are
feeling
the
publicity
it
terrible
george
miserably
i
want
to
do
what
right
olivia
you
believe
that
olivia
of
course
i
do
it
only
that
we
do
quite
agree
as
to
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong
george
it
is
a
question
of
agreeing
right
is
right
and
wrong
is
wrong
all
the
world
over
olivia
with
a
sad
little
smile
but
more
particularly
in
buckinghamshire
i
think
george
if
i
only
considered
myself
i
should
say
let
us
pack
this
man
telworthy
back
to
australia
he
would
make
no
claim
he
would
accept
money
to
go
away
and
say
nothing
about
it
if
i
consulted
simply
my
own
happiness
olivia
that
is
what
i
should
say
but
when
i
consult
er
olivia
surprised
mine
george
my
conscience
olivia
oh
george
then
i
ca
do
it
it
wrong
he
is
at
the
window
as
he
says
this
olivia
making
her
first
and
last
appeal
george
are
i
worth
a
little
george
turning
round
dinah
loudly
for
dinah
benefit
well
then
i
write
to
him
and
ah
dinah
where
aunt
julia
dinah
coming
in
we
seen
the
pigs
and
now
she
discussing
the
art
of
landseer
with
brian
i
just
came
to
ask
olivia
dinah
dear
bring
aunt
julia
here
and
brian
too
we
have
things
we
want
to
talk
about
with
you
all
george
outraged
olivia
dinah
righto
what
fun
exit
dinah
george
olivia
you
do
seriously
suggest
that
we
should
discuss
these
things
with
a
child
like
dinah
and
a
young
man
like
strange
a
mere
acquaintance
olivia
dinah
will
have
to
know
i
very
fond
of
her
george
you
ca
send
me
away
without
telling
dinah
and
brian
is
my
friend
you
have
your
solicitor
and
your
aunt
and
your
conscience
to
consult
may
i
even
have
brian
george
forgetting
i
should
have
thought
that
your
olivia
yes
but
we
do
know
where
jacko
is
george
i
was
not
referring
to
er
telworthy
olivia
well
then
george
well
naturally
i
you
must
oh
this
is
horrible
he
comes
back
to
his
desk
as
the
others
come
in
olivia
getting
up
george
and
i
have
had
some
rather
bad
news
aunt
julia
we
wanted
your
advice
where
will
you
sit
lady
marden
thank
you
olivia
i
can
sit
down
by
myself
she
does
so
near
george
dinah
sits
on
the
sofa
with
olivia
and
brian
half
leans
against
the
back
of
it
there
is
a
hush
of
expectation
what
is
it
money
i
suppose
nobody
safe
nowadays
george
signalling
for
help
olivia
olivia
we
just
heard
that
my
first
husband
is
still
alive
dinah
telworthy
brian
good
lord
lady
marden
george
dinah
excitedly
and
only
this
morning
i
was
saying
that
nothing
ever
happened
in
this
house
remorsefully
to
olivia
darling
i
mean
that
darling
one
lady
marden
what
does
this
mean
george
i
leave
you
for
ten
minutes
barely
ten
minutes
to
go
and
look
at
the
pigs
and
when
i
come
back
you
tell
me
that
olivia
is
a
bigamist
brian
indignantly
i
say
olivia
restraining
him
brian
to
olivia
if
this
is
a
row
i
on
your
side
lady
marden
well
george
george
i
afraid
it
true
aunt
julia
we
heard
the
news
just
before
lunch
just
before
you
came
we
only
this
moment
had
an
opportunity
of
talking
about
it
of
wondering
what
to
do
lady
marden
what
was
his
name
tel
something
olivia
jacob
telworthy
lady
marden
so
he
alive
still
george
apparently
there
seems
to
be
no
doubt
about
it
lady
marden
to
olivia
did
you
him
die
i
should
always
want
to
my
husband
die
before
i
married
again
not
that
i
approve
of
second
marriages
anyhow
i
told
you
so
at
the
time
george
olivia
me
aunt
julia
lady
marden
did
i
well
i
generally
say
what
i
think
george
i
ought
to
tell
you
aunt
julia
that
no
blame
attaches
to
olivia
over
this
of
that
i
am
perfectly
satisfied
it
fault
except
lady
marden
except
telworthy
seems
to
have
been
rather
careless
well
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
george
that
just
it
it
a
terrible
situation
there
bound
to
be
so
much
publicity
not
only
all
this
but
but
telworthy
past
and
and
everything
lady
marden
i
should
have
said
that
it
was
telworthy
present
which
was
the
trouble
had
he
a
past
as
well
olivia
he
was
a
fraudulent
company
promoter
he
went
to
prison
a
good
deal
lady
marden
george
you
never
told
me
this
george
i
er
olivia
i
do
see
he
should
want
to
talk
about
it
dinah
indignantly
what
it
got
to
do
with
olivia
anyhow
it
not
fault
lady
marden
sarcastically
oh
no
i
daresay
it
mine
olivia
to
george
you
wanted
to
ask
aunt
julia
what
was
the
right
thing
to
do
brian
bursting
out
good
heavens
what
there
to
do
except
the
one
and
only
thing
they
all
look
at
him
and
he
becomes
embarrassed
i
sorry
you
do
want
to
olivia
do
brian
lady
marden
well
go
on
mr
strange
what
would
do
in
position
brian
do
say
to
the
woman
i
loved
you
and
let
this
other
damned
fellow
come
and
take
you
from
me
if
he
can
and
he
could
how
could
he
not
if
the
woman
chose
lady
marden
gazes
at
brian
in
amazement
george
in
anger
olivia
presses
his
hand
gratefully
he
has
said
what
she
has
been
waiting
oh
so
eagerly
for
george
to
say
dinah
adoringly
oh
brian
in
a
whisper
it
me
is
it
and
not
olivia
brian
you
baby
of
course
lady
marden
i
afraid
mr
strange
your
morals
are
as
peculiar
as
your
views
on
art
if
you
had
led
a
more
healthy
life
brian
this
is
not
a
question
of
morals
or
of
art
it
a
question
of
love
dinah
hear
hear
lady
marden
to
george
is
it
that
girl
bedtime
yet
olivia
to
dinah
we
let
her
sit
up
a
little
longer
if
she
good
dinah
i
will
be
good
olivia
only
i
thought
anybody
however
important
a
debate
was
was
allowed
to
say
hear
hear
george
coldly
i
really
think
we
could
discuss
this
better
if
mr
strange
took
dinah
out
for
a
walk
strange
if
you
er
olivia
tell
them
what
you
have
settled
first
george
lady
marden
settled
what
is
there
to
be
settled
it
settles
itself
george
sadly
that
just
it
lady
marden
the
marriage
must
be
annulled
is
that
the
word
george
george
i
presume
so
lady
marden
one
solicitor
will
know
all
about
that
of
course
brian
and
when
the
marriage
has
been
annulled
what
then
lady
marden
presumably
olivia
will
return
to
her
husband
brian
bitterly
and
morality
as
expounded
by
bishop
landseer
george
angered
i
do
know
what
you
mean
by
bishop
landseer
morality
is
acting
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
the
land
and
the
laws
of
the
church
i
am
quite
prepared
to
believe
that
creed
embraces
neither
marriage
nor
monogamy
but
my
creed
is
different
brian
fiercely
my
creed
includes
both
marriage
monogamy
and
monogamy
means
sticking
to
the
woman
you
love
as
long
as
she
wants
you
lady
marden
calmly
you
suggest
that
george
and
olivia
should
go
on
living
together
although
they
have
never
been
legally
married
and
wait
for
this
telworthy
man
to
divorce
her
and
then
bless
the
man
what
do
you
think
the
county
would
say
brian
scornfully
does
it
matter
dinah
well
if
you
really
want
to
know
the
men
would
say
gad
she
a
fine
woman
i
do
wonder
he
sticks
to
her
and
the
women
would
say
i
ca
what
he
sees
in
her
to
stick
to
her
like
that
and
they
both
say
after
all
he
may
be
a
damn
fool
but
you
ca
deny
he
a
sportsman
that
what
the
county
would
say
george
indignantly
was
it
for
this
sort
of
thing
olivia
that
you
insisted
on
having
dinah
and
mr
strange
in
here
to
insult
me
in
my
own
house
lady
marden
i
ca
think
what
young
people
are
coming
to
nowadays
olivia
i
think
dear
you
and
brian
had
better
go
dinah
getting
up
we
will
go
but
i
just
going
to
say
one
thing
uncle
george
brian
and
i
going
to
marry
each
other
and
when
we
are
married
we
stick
to
each
other
many
of
our
dead
husbands
and
wives
turn
up
she
goes
out
indignantly
followed
by
brian
george
upon
my
word
this
is
a
pleasant
discussion
olivia
i
think
the
discussion
is
over
george
it
is
only
a
question
of
where
i
shall
go
while
you
are
bringing
your
what
sort
of
suit
did
you
call
it
lady
marden
to
george
nullity
suit
i
suppose
that
the
best
thing
george
it
horrible
the
awful
publicity
that
it
should
be
happening
to
that
what
i
ca
get
over
lady
marden
i
do
remember
anything
of
the
sort
in
the
marden
family
before
ever
george
absently
lady
fanny
lady
marden
recollecting
yes
of
course
but
that
was
two
hundred
years
ago
the
standards
were
different
then
besides
it
was
quite
the
same
anyhow
george
absently
no
it
was
quite
the
same
lady
marden
no
we
shall
all
feel
it
terribly
george
his
apology
if
there
were
any
other
way
olivia
what
i
do
it
the
only
way
is
it
all
that
that
fellow
said
of
course
it
sounds
very
well
but
as
things
are
there
anything
in
marriage
or
is
there
you
believe
that
there
is
do
you
you
are
one
of
these
socialists
well
then
we
go
on
living
together
when
you
another
man
wife
it
is
only
what
people
will
say
but
it
wrong
is
it
and
supposing
he
divorce
you
are
we
to
go
on
living
together
unmarried
for
olivia
you
seem
to
think
that
i
just
thinking
of
the
publicity
what
people
will
say
i
not
i
not
that
comes
in
any
way
but
i
want
to
do
what
right
what
best
i
do
mean
best
for
what
makes
us
happiest
i
mean
what
really
best
what
rightest
what
anybody
else
would
do
in
my
place
know
it
so
unfair
you
not
my
wife
at
all
but
i
want
to
do
what
right
oh
olivia
olivia
you
do
understand
do
you
they
have
both
forgotten
lady
marden
olivia
has
never
taken
her
eyes
off
him
as
he
makes
his
last
attempt
to
convince
himself
olivia
almost
tenderly
so
very
very
well
george
oh
i
understand
just
what
you
are
feeling
and
oh
i
do
so
wish
that
you
could
with
a
little
sigh
but
then
it
would
be
george
not
the
george
i
married
with
a
rueful
little
laugh
or
did
quite
marry
lady
marden
i
must
say
i
think
you
are
both
talking
a
little
wildly
olivia
repeating
it
oh
so
tenderly
or
did
quite
marry
she
looks
at
him
with
all
her
heart
in
her
eyes
she
is
giving
him
his
last
chance
to
say
damn
telworthy
you
mine
he
struggles
desperately
with
himself
will
he
will
he
but
we
shall
never
know
for
at
that
moment
anne
comes
in
anne
pim

the
struggle

you
she
makes
room
for
him
on
the
sofa
next
to
her
the
fact
is
pim
you
gave
us
rather
a
surprise
this
morning
and
before
we
had
time
to
realise
what
it
all
meant
you
had
gone
pim
a
surprise
marden

not
an
unpleasant
one
i
hope
olivia
well
rather
a
surprising
one
george
olivia
allow
me
a
moment
pim
you
mentioned
a
man
called
telworthy
this
morning
my
wife
used
to
that
is
to
say
i
used
to
that
is
there
are
reasons
olivia
i
think
we
had
better
be
perfectly
frank
george
lady
marden
i
am
years
of
age
pim
and
i
can
say
that
i
never
had
a
moment
uneasiness
by
telling
the
truth
pim
after
a
desperate
effort
to
keep
up
with
the
conversation
oh
i
er
i
afraid
i
am
rather
at
sea
have
i
er
left
anything
unsaid
in
presenting
my
credentials
to
you
this
morning
this
telworthy
whom
you
mention
i
seem
to
remember
the
name
olivia
pim
you
told
us
this
morning
of
a
man
whom
you
had
met
on
the
boat
a
man
who
had
come
down
in
the
world
whom
you
had
known
in
sydney
a
man
called
telworthy
pim
relieved
ah
yes
yes
of
course
i
did
say
telworthy
did
i
most
curious
coincidence
lady
marden
poor
man
poor
man
let
me
see
it
must
have
been
ten
years
ago
george
just
a
moment
pim
you
quite
sure
that
his
name
was
telworthy
pim
telworthy
telworthy
did
i
say
telworthy
yes
that
was
it
telworthy
poor
fellow
olivia
i
going
to
be
perfectly
frank
with
you
pim
i
feel
quite
sure
that
i
can
trust
you
this
man
telworthy
whom
you
met
is
my
husband
pim
your
husband
he
looks
in
mild
surprise
at
george
but
er
olivia
my
first
husband
his
death
was
announced
six
years
ago
i
had
left
him
some
years
before
that
but
there
seems
no
doubt
from
your
story
that
he
still
alive
his
record
the
country
he
comes
from
above
all
the
very
unusual
name
telworthy
pim
telworthy
yes
certainly
a
most
peculiar
name
i
remember
saying
so
your
first
husband
dear
me
dear
me
george
you
understand
pim
that
all
this
is
in
absolute
confidence
pim
of
course
of
course
olivia
well
since
he
is
my
husband
we
naturally
want
to
know
something
about
him
where
is
he
now
for
instance
pim
surprised
where
is
he
now
but
surely
i
told
you
i
told
you
what
happened
at
marseilles
george
at
marseilles
pim
yes
yes
poor
fellow
it
was
most
unfortunate
quite
happy
again
you
must
understand
lady
marden
that
although
i
had
met
the
poor
fellow
before
in
australia
i
was
never
in
any
way
intimate
george
thumping
the
desk
where
is
he
that
what
we
want
to
know
pim
turns
to
him
with
a
start
olivia
please
pim
pim
where
is
he
now
but
but
did
i
tell
you
of
the
curious
fatality
at
marseilles
poor
fellow
the
all
pim
yes
yes
a
herring
i
understand
olivia
understanding
first
do
you
mean
he
dead
pim
dead
of
course
did
i
olivia
laughing
hysterically
oh
pim
you
oh
what
a
husband
to
have
oh
i
but
that
is
all
she
can
say
for
the
moment
lady
marden
pull
yourself
together
olivia
this
is
so
unhealthy
for
you
to
pim
so
he
really
dead
this
time
pim
oh
undoubtedly
undoubtedly
a
fishbone
lodged
in
his
throat
george
trying
to
realise
it
dead
olivia
struggling
with
her
laughter
i
think
you
must
excuse
me
pim
i
can
never
thank
you
enough
a
herring
there
something
about
a
herring
morality
depends
on
such
little
things
george
you
shaking
her
head
at
him
in
a
weak
state
of
laughter
she
hurries
out
of
the
room
pim
dear
me
dear
me
george
now
let
us
have
this
quite
clear
pim
you
say
that
the
man
telworthy
jacob
telworthy
is
dead
pim
telworthy
yes
did
i
say
telworthy
this
man
i
was
telling
you
about
george
he
dead
pim
yes
yes
he
died
at
marseilles
lady
marden
a
dispensation
of
providence
george
one
can
look
at
it
in
no
other
light
george
dead
suddenly
annoyed
really
pim
i
think
you
might
have
told
us
before
pim
but
i
i
telling
you
i
george
if
you
had
only
told
us
the
whole
story
at
once
instead
of
in
two
two
instalments
like
this
you
would
have
saved
us
all
a
good
deal
of
anxiety
pim
really
i
lady
marden
i
am
sure
pim
meant
well
george
but
it
seems
a
pity
he
could
have
said
so
before
if
the
man
was
dead
try
to
hush
it
up
pim
lost
again
really
lady
marden
i
george
getting
up
well
well
at
any
rate
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
pim
for
having
come
down
to
us
this
afternoon
dead
and
so
forth
but
the
situation
would
have
been
impossible
had
he
lived
holding
out
his
hand
lady
marden
pim
pim
george
takes
him
to
the
door
of
course
if
i
had
to
himself
telworthy
i
that
was
the
name
he
goes
out
still
wondering
george
with
a
sigh
of
thankfulness
well
this
is
wonderful
news
aunt
julia
lady
marden
most
providential
you
understand
of
course
that
you
are
not
married
to
olivia
george
who
did
not
married
lady
marden
if
her
first
husband
only
died
at
marseilles
a
few
days
ago
george
good
heavens
lady
marden
not
that
it
matters
you
can
get
married
quietly
again
nobody
need
know
george
considering
it
yes
yes
then
all
these
years
we
have
been
er
yes
lady
marden
who
going
to
know
george
yes
yes
that
true
and
in
perfect
innocence
too
lady
marden
i
should
suggest
a
registry
office
in
london
george
a
registry
office
yes
lady
marden
better
go
up
to
town
this
afternoon
ca
do
it
too
quickly
george
yes
yes
we
can
stay
at
an
hotel
lady
marden
surprised
george
george
what
lady
marden
will
stay
at
your
club
george
oh
ah
yes
of
course
aunt
julia
lady
marden
better
take
your
solicitor
with
you
to
be
on
the
safe
side
to
the
registry
office
i
mean
george
yes
lady
marden
getting
up
well
i
must
be
getting
along
george
say
to
olivia
for
me
and
those
children
of
course
you
allow
this
absurd
between
them
to
come
to
anything
george
most
certainly
not
aunt
julia
lady
marden
indicating
the
windows
i
go
way
as
she
goes
and
get
olivia
out
more
george
i
do
like
these
hysterics
you
want
to
be
firm
with
her
george
firmly
yes
yes
he
waves
to
her
and
then
goes
back
to
his
seat
olivia
comes
in
and
stands
in
the
middle
of
the
room
looking
at
him
he
comes
to
her
eagerly
george
holding
out
his
hands
olivia
olivia
but
it
is
not
so
easy
as
that
olivia
drawing
herself
up
proudly
telworthy
act
iii
olivia
is
standing
where
we
left
her
at
the
end
of
the
last
act
george
taken
aback
olivia
i
i
do
understand
olivia
leaving
melodrama
with
a
little
laugh
and
coming
down
to
him
poor
george
did
i
frighten
you
rather
george
you
so
strange
i
do
understand
you
you
not
like
the
olivia
i
know
they
sit
down
on
the
sofa
together
olivia
perhaps
you
do
know
me
very
well
after
all
george
affectionately
oh
that
nonsense
old
girl
you
just
my
olivia
olivia
and
yet
it
seemed
as
though
i
was
going
to
be
your
olivia
half
an
hour
ago
george
with
a
shudder
do
talk
about
it
it
does
bear
thinking
about
well
thank
heaven
that
over
now
we
can
get
married
again
quietly
and
nobody
will
be
any
the
wiser
olivia
married
again
george
yes
dear
as
you
er
he
laughs
uneasily
said
just
now
you
are
telworthy
just
for
the
moment
but
we
can
soon
put
that
right
my
idea
was
to
go
up
this
evening
and
er
make
arrangements
and
if
you
come
up
morning
if
we
can
manage
it
by
then
we
could
get
quietly
married
at
a
registry
office
and
er
nobody
any
the
wiser
olivia
yes
i
see
you
want
me
to
marry
you
at
a
registry
office
george
if
we
can
arrange
it
by
then
i
do
know
how
long
these
things
take
but
i
should
imagine
there
would
be
no
difficulty
olivia
oh
no
that
part
ought
to
be
quite
easy
but
she
hesitates
george
but
what
olivia
well
if
you
want
to
marry
me
george
ought
you
to
propose
to
me
first
george
amazed
propose
olivia
yes
it
is
usual
is
it
to
propose
to
a
person
before
you
marry
her
and
and
we
want
to
do
the
usual
thing
do
we
george
upset
but
you
but
we
olivia
you
see
dear
you
george
marden
and
i
olivia
telworthy
and
you
you
attracted
by
me
and
think
i
would
make
you
a
good
wife
and
you
want
to
marry
me
well
naturally
you
propose
to
me
first
and
tell
me
how
much
you
are
attracted
by
me
and
what
a
good
wife
you
think
i
shall
make
and
how
badly
you
want
to
marry
me
george
falling
into
the
humour
of
it
as
he
thinks
the
baby
did
she
want
to
be
proposed
to
all
over
again
olivia
well
she
did
rather
george
rather
fancying
himself
as
an
actor
she
shall
then
he
adopts
what
he
considers
to
be
an
appropriate
attitude
telworthy
i
have
long
admired
you
in
silence
and
the
time
has
now
come
to
put
my
admiration
into
words
er
but
apparently
he
finds
a
difficulty
olivia
hopefully
into
words
george
er
olivia
with
the
idea
of
helping
oh
marden
george
er
may
i
call
you
olivia
olivia
yes
george
george
taking
her
hand
olivia
i
he
hesitates
olivia
i
do
want
to
interrupt
but
ought
you
to
be
on
your
knees
it
is
usual
i
believe
if
one
of
the
servants
came
in
you
could
say
you
were
looking
for
my
scissors
george
really
olivia
you
must
allow
me
to
manage
my
own
proposal
in
my
own
way
olivia
meekly
i
sorry
do
go
on
george
well
er
confound
it
olivia
i
love
you
will
you
marry
me
olivia
thank
you
george
i
will
think
it
over
george
laughing
silly
girl
well
then
morning
no
i
afraid
olivia
he
laughs
again
but
we
go
and
have
a
good
lunch
somewhere
olivia
i
will
think
it
over
george
george
well
give
us
a
kiss
while
you
thinking
olivia
i
afraid
you
must
kiss
me
until
we
are
actually
engaged
george
laughing
uneasily
oh
we
need
take
it
as
seriously
as
all
that
olivia
but
a
woman
must
take
a
proposal
seriously
george
alarmed
at
last
what
do
you
mean
olivia
i
mean
that
the
whole
question
as
i
heard
somebody
say
once
demands
much
more
anxious
thought
than
either
of
us
has
given
it
these
hasty
marriages
george
hasty
olivia
well
you
only
just
proposed
to
me
and
you
want
to
marry
me
george
now
you
talking
perfect
nonsense
olivia
you
know
quite
well
that
our
case
is
utterly
different
from
from
any
other
olivia
all
the
same
one
has
to
ask
oneself
questions
with
a
young
girl
like
well
with
a
young
girl
love
may
well
seem
to
be
all
that
matters
but
with
a
woman
of
my
age
it
is
different
i
have
to
ask
myself
if
you
can
afford
to
support
a
wife
george
coldly
fortunately
that
is
a
question
that
you
can
very
easily
answer
for
yourself
olivia
well
but
i
have
been
hearing
rather
bad
reports
lately
what
with
taxes
always
going
up
and
rents
always
going
down
some
of
our
landowners
are
getting
into
rather
straitened
circumstances
at
least
so
i
told
george
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
olivia
surprised
oh
is
it
true
i
heard
of
a
case
only
this
morning
a
landowner
who
always
seemed
to
be
very
comfortably
off
but
who
could
afford
an
allowance
for
his
only
niece
when
she
wanted
to
get
married
it
made
me
think
that
one
ought
to
judge
by
appearances
george
you
know
perfectly
well
that
i
can
afford
to
support
a
wife
as
my
wife
be
supported
olivia
i
so
glad
dear
then
your
income
you
are
getting
anxious
at
all
george
stiffly
you
know
perfectly
well
what
my
income
is
i
see
no
reason
for
anxiety
in
the
future
olivia
ah
well
then
we
need
think
about
that
any
more
well
then
there
is
another
thing
to
be
considered
george
i
ca
make
out
what
you
up
to
do
you
want
to
get
married
to
er
legalise
this
extraordinary
situation
in
which
we
are
placed
olivia
i
want
to
be
sure
that
i
am
going
to
be
happy
george
i
just
jump
at
the
very
first
offer
i
have
had
since
my
husband
died
without
considering
the
whole
question
very
carefully
george
so
i
under
consideration
eh
olivia
every
suitor
is
george
sarcastically
as
he
thinks
well
go
on
olivia
well
then
there
your
niece
you
have
a
niece
who
lives
with
you
of
course
dinah
is
a
delightful
girl
but
one
does
like
marrying
into
a
household
in
which
there
is
another
woman
but
perhaps
she
will
be
getting
married
herself
soon
george
i
see
no
prospect
of
it
olivia
i
think
it
would
make
it
much
easier
if
she
did
george
is
this
a
threat
olivia
are
you
telling
me
that
if
i
do
not
allow
young
strange
to
marry
dinah
you
will
not
marry
me
olivia
a
threat
oh
no
george
george
then
what
does
it
mean
olivia
i
just
wondering
if
you
love
me
as
much
as
brian
loves
dinah
you
love
me
george
from
his
heart
you
know
i
do
old
girl
he
comes
to
her
olivia
you
not
just
attracted
by
my
pretty
face
it
a
pretty
face
george
it
an
adorable
one
he
tries
to
kiss
it
but
she
turns
away
olivia
how
can
i
be
sure
that
it
is
not
my
face
which
makes
you
think
that
you
care
for
me
love
which
rests
upon
a
mere
outward
attraction
can
not
lead
to
any
lasting
happiness
as
one
of
our
thinkers
has
observed
george
what
come
over
you
olivia
i
do
understand
what
driving
at
why
should
you
doubt
my
love
olivia
ah
why
george
you
ca
pretend
that
we
have
been
happy
together
i
i
been
a
good
pal
to
you
eh
we
we
suit
each
other
old
girl
olivia
do
we
george
of
course
we
do
olivia
i
wonder
when
two
people
of
our
age
think
of
getting
married
one
wants
to
be
very
sure
that
there
is
real
community
of
ideas
between
them
whether
it
is
a
comparatively
trivial
matter
like
the
right
colour
for
a
curtain
or
some
very
much
more
serious
question
of
conduct
which
arises
one
wants
to
feel
that
there
is
some
chance
of
agreement
between
husband
and
wife
george
we
we
love
each
other
old
girl
olivia
we
do
now
yes
but
what
shall
we
be
like
in
five
years
time
supposing
that
after
we
have
been
married
five
years
we
found
ourselves
estranged
from
each
other
upon
such
questions
as
future
or
the
decorations
of
the
or
even
the
advice
to
give
to
a
friend
who
had
innocently
contracted
a
bigamous
marriage
how
bitterly
we
should
regret
then
our
hasty
plunge
into
a
matrimony
which
was
no
true
partnership
whether
of
tastes
or
of
ideas
or
even
of
consciences
with
a
sigh
ah
me
george
nastily
unfortunately
for
your
argument
olivia
i
can
answer
you
out
of
your
own
mouth
you
seem
to
have
forgotten
what
you
said
this
morning
in
the
case
of
er
young
strange
olivia
reproachfully
is
it
quite
fair
george
to
drag
up
what
was
said
this
morning
george
you
brought
it
on
yourself
olivia
i
well
and
what
did
i
say
this
morning
george
you
said
that
it
was
quite
enough
that
strange
was
a
gentleman
and
in
love
with
dinah
for
me
to
let
them
marry
each
other
olivia
oh
that
enough
george
george
triumphantly
you
said
so
olivia
meekly
well
if
you
think
so
too
i
i
do
mind
risking
it
george
kindly
aha
my
dear
you
see
olivia
then
you
do
think
it
enough
george
i
er
yes
yes
i
i
think
so
olivia
going
to
him
my
darling
one
then
we
can
have
a
double
wedding
how
jolly
george
astounded
a
double
one
olivia
yes
you
and
me
brian
and
dinah
george
firmly
now
look
here
olivia
understand
once
and
for
all
i
am
not
to
be
blackmailed
into
giving
my
consent
to
dinah
engagement
neither
blackmailed
nor
tricked
our
marriage
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
dinah
olivia
no
dear
i
quite
understand
they
may
take
place
about
the
same
time
but
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
each
other
george
i
see
no
prospect
of
dinah
marriage
taking
place
for
many
years
olivia
no
dear
that
was
what
i
said
george
not
understanding
for
the
moment
you
said
i
see
now
olivia
let
us
have
this
perfectly
clear
you
apparently
insist
on
treating
my
er
proposal
as
serious
olivia
surprised
was
it
serious
were
you
trifling
with
me
george
you
know
quite
well
what
i
mean
you
treat
it
as
an
ordinary
proposal
from
a
man
to
a
woman
who
have
never
been
more
than
acquaintances
before
very
well
then
will
you
tell
me
what
you
propose
to
do
if
you
decide
to
ah
refuse
me
you
do
not
suggest
that
we
should
go
on
living
together
unmarried
olivia
shocked
of
course
not
george
what
would
the
county
i
mean
heaven
i
mean
the
law
i
mean
of
not
besides
it
so
unnecessary
if
i
decide
to
accept
you
of
i
shall
marry
you
george
quite
so
and
if
you
ah
decide
to
refuse
me
what
will
you
do
olivia
nothing
george
meaning
by
that
olivia
just
that
george
i
shall
stay
here
just
as
before
i
like
this
house
it
wants
a
little
perhaps
but
i
do
like
it
george
yes
i
shall
be
quite
happy
here
george
i
see
you
will
continue
to
live
down
here
in
spite
of
what
you
said
just
now
about
the
immorality
of
it
olivia
surprised
but
there
nothing
immoral
in
a
widow
living
alone
in
a
big
country
house
with
perhaps
the
niece
of
a
friend
of
hers
staying
with
her
just
to
keep
her
company
george
sarcastic
and
what
shall
be
doing
when
you
so
very
kindly
taken
possession
of
my
house
for
me
olivia
i
do
know
george
travelling
i
expect
you
could
come
down
sometimes
with
a
chaperone
i
suppose
there
would
be
nothing
wrong
in
that
george
indignant
thank
you
and
what
if
i
refuse
to
be
turned
out
of
my
house
olivia
then
seeing
that
we
ca
be
in
it
it
looks
as
though
you
have
to
turn
out
casually
i
suppose
there
are
legal
ways
of
doing
these
things
you
have
to
consult
your
solicitor
again
george
amazed
legal
ways
olivia
well
you
could
me
out
could
you
you
have
to
get
an
injunction
against
me
or
prosecute
me
for
trespass
or
something
it
would
make
an
awfully
unusual
case
would
it
the
papers
would
be
full
of
it
george
you
must
be
mad
olivia
dreamily
widow
of
takes
possession
of
house
popular
country
gentleman
denied
entrance
to
his
own
home
doomed
to
travel
george
angrily
i
had
enough
of
this
do
you
mean
all
this
nonsense
olivia
i
do
mean
george
that
i
am
in
no
hurry
to
go
up
to
london
and
get
married
i
love
the
country
just
now
and
with
a
sigh
after
this
morning
i
rather
tired
of
husbands
george
in
a
rage
i
never
heard
so
much
damned
nonsense
in
my
life
i
will
leave
you
to
come
to
your
senses
he
goes
out
indignantly
olivia
who
has
forgiven
him
already
throws
a
loving
kiss
after
him
and
then
turns
triumphantly
to
her
dear
curtains
she
takes
them
smiling
to
the
sofa
and
has
just
got
to
work
again
when
pim
appears
at
the
open
windows
pim
in
a
whisper
er
may
i
come
in
marden
olivia
turning
round
in
surprise
pim
pim
anxiously
marden
is
er
not
here
olivia
getting
up
do
you
want
to
see
him
i
will
tell
him
pim
no
no
no
not
for
the
world
he
comes
in
and
looks
anxiously
at
the
door
there
is
no
immediate
danger
of
his
returning
marden
olivia
surprised
no
i
do
think
so
what
is
it
you
pim
i
took
the
liberty
of
returning
by
the
window
in
the
hope
of
er
coming
upon
you
alone
marden
olivia
yes
pim
still
rather
nervous
i
er
marden
will
be
very
angry
with
me
quite
rightly
i
blame
myself
entirely
i
do
not
know
how
i
can
have
been
so
stupid
olivia
what
is
it
pim
has
my
husband
come
to
life
again
pim
marden
i
throw
myself
on
your
mercy
entirely
the
fact
is
his
name
was
polwittle
olivia
at
a
loss
whose
my
husband
pim
yes
yes
the
name
came
back
to
me
suddenly
just
as
i
reached
the
gate
polwittle
poor
fellow
olivia
but
pim
my
husband
name
was
telworthy
pim
no
no
polwittle
olivia
but
really
i
ought
to
pim
firmly
polwittle
it
came
back
to
me
suddenly
just
as
i
reached
the
gate
for
the
moment
i
had
thoughts
of
conveying
the
news
by
letter
i
was
naturally
disinclined
to
return
in
person
and
polwittle
proudly
if
you
remember
i
always
said
it
was
a
curious
name
olivia
but
who
polwittle
pim
in
surprise
at
her
stupidity
the
man
i
have
been
telling
you
about
who
met
with
the
sad
fatality
at
marseilles
henry
polwittle
or
was
it
ernest
no
henry
i
think
poor
fellow
olivia
indignantly
but
you
said
his
name
was
telworthy
how
you
pim
yes
yes
i
blame
myself
entirely
olivia
but
how
could
you
of
a
name
like
telworthy
if
it
was
telworthy
pim
eagerly
ah
that
is
the
really
interesting
thing
about
the
whole
matter
olivia
pim
all
your
visits
here
have
been
interesting
pim
yes
but
you
see
on
my
first
appearance
here
this
morning
i
was
received
by
er
miss
diana
olivia
dinah
pim
miss
dinah
yes
she
was
in
er
rather
a
communicative
mood
and
she
happened
to
mention
by
way
of
passing
the
time
that
before
your
marriage
to
marden
you
had
been
a
er
olivia
telworthy
pim
yes
yes
telworthy
of
course
she
mentioned
also
australia
by
some
process
of
the
brain
which
strikes
me
as
decidedly
curious
when
i
was
trying
to
recollect
the
name
of
the
poor
fellow
on
the
boat
whom
you
remember
i
had
also
met
in
australia
the
fact
that
this
other
name
was
also
stored
in
my
memory
a
name
equally
peculiar
this
fact
i
say
olivia
seeing
that
the
sentence
is
rapidly
going
to
pieces
yes
i
understand
pim
i
blame
myself
i
blame
myself
entirely
olivia
oh
you
must
do
that
pim
it
was
really
dinah
fault
for
inflicting
all
our
family
history
on
you
pim
oh
but
a
charming
young
woman
i
assure
you
i
was
very
much
interested
in
all
that
she
told
me
getting
up
well
er
marden
i
can
only
hope
that
you
will
forgive
me
for
the
needless
distress
i
have
caused
you
olivia
oh
you
must
worry
about
that
please
pim
and
you
will
tell
your
husband
you
will
break
the
news
to
him
olivia
smiling
to
herself
i
will
break
the
news
to
him
pim
you
understand
how
it
is
that
i
thought
it
better
to
come
to
you
in
the
first
place
olivia
i
am
very
glad
you
did
pim
holding
out
his
hand
then
i
will
say
and
er
olivia
just
a
moment
pim
let
us
have
it
quite
clear
this
time
you
never
knew
my
husband
jacob
telworthy
you
never
met
him
in
australia
you
never
saw
him
on
the
boat
and
nothing
whatever
happened
to
him
at
marseilles
is
that
right
pim
yes
yes
that
is
so
olivia
so
that
since
he
was
supposed
to
have
died
in
australia
six
years
ago
he
is
presumably
still
dead
pim
yes
yes
undoubtedly
olivia
holding
out
her
hand
with
a
charming
smile
then
pim
and
thank
you
so
much
for
for
all
your
trouble
pim
not
at
all
marden
i
can
only
assure
you
i
dinah
from
the
window
hullo
here
pim
she
comes
in
followed
by
brian
pim
anxiously
looking
at
the
door
in
case
marden
should
come
in
yes
yes
i
er
dinah
oh
pim
you
must
run
away
without
even
saying
how
do
you
do
such
old
friends
as
we
are
why
it
is
ages
since
i
saw
you
are
you
staying
to
tea
pim
i
afraid
i
olivia
pim
has
to
hurry
away
dinah
you
must
keep
him
dinah
well
but
you
come
back
again
pim
i
fear
that
i
am
only
a
miss
er
dinah
olivia
you
can
walk
with
him
to
the
gate
dear
pim
gratefully
to
olivia
thank
you
he
edges
towards
the
window
if
you
would
be
so
kind
miss
dinah
brian
i
catch
you
up
dinah
come
along
then
pim
as
they
go
out
i
want
to
hear
all
about
your
wife
you
have
really
told
me
anything
yet
olivia
resumes
her
work
and
brian
sits
on
the
back
of
the
sofa
looking
at
her
brian
awkwardly
i
just
wanted
to
say
if
you
do
think
it
cheek
that
i
i
on
your
side
if
i
may
be
and
if
i
can
help
you
at
all
i
should
be
very
proud
of
being
allowed
to
olivia
looking
up
at
him
brian
you
dear
that
sweet
of
you
but
it
quite
all
right
now
you
know
brian
oh
i
so
glad
olivia
yes
that
what
pim
came
back
to
say
he
made
a
mistake
about
the
name
smiling
george
is
the
only
husband
i
have
brian
surprised
what
you
mean
that
the
whole
thing
that
pim
with
conviction
silly
ass
olivia
kindly
oh
well
he
did
mean
to
be
after
a
pause
brian
do
you
know
anything
about
the
law
brian
i
afraid
not
i
hate
the
law
why
olivia
casually
oh
i
just
i
was
wondering
thinking
about
all
the
shocks
we
been
through
second
marriages
and
all
that
brian
oh
it
a
rotten
business
olivia
i
suppose
there
nothing
wrong
in
getting
married
to
the
person
twice
brian
a
hundred
times
if
you
like
i
should
think
olivia
oh
brian
after
all
in
france
they
always
go
through
it
twice
they
once
before
the
mayor
or
somebody
and
once
in
church
olivia
of
course
they
do
how
silly
of
me
i
think
it
rather
a
nice
idea
they
ought
to
do
it
in
england
more
brian
well
once
will
be
enough
for
dinah
and
me
if
you
can
work
it
anxiously
think
there
any
chance
olivia
olivia
smiling
every
chance
dear
brian
jumping
up
i
say
do
you
really
have
you
squared
him
i
mean
has
he
olivia
go
and
catch
them
up
now
we
talk
about
it
later
on
brian
bless
you
righto
as
he
goes
out
by
the
windows
george
comes
in
at
the
door
george
stands
looking
after
him
and
then
turns
to
olivia
who
is
absorbed
in
her
curtains
he
walks
up
and
down
the
room
fidgeting
with
things
waiting
for
her
to
speak
as
she
says
nothing
he
begins
to
talk
himself
but
in
an
obviously
unconcerned
way
there
is
a
pause
after
each
answer
of
hers
before
he
gets
out
his
next
remark
george
casually
fellow
strange
olivia
equally
casually
brian
yes
is
he
and
such
a
nice
boy
george
got
fifty
pounds
for
a
picture
the
other
day
did
he
hey
olivia
yes
of
course
he
has
only
just
begun
george
critics
think
well
of
him
what
olivia
they
all
say
he
has
genius
oh
i
do
think
there
any
doubt
about
it
george
of
course
i
do
profess
to
know
anything
about
painting
olivia
you
never
had
time
to
take
it
up
dear
george
i
know
what
i
like
of
course
ca
say
i
see
much
in
this
stuff
if
a
man
can
paint
why
ca
he
paint
like
like
rubens
or
or
reynolds
olivia
i
suppose
we
all
have
our
own
styles
brian
will
find
his
directly
of
course
he
only
just
beginning
george
but
they
think
a
lot
of
him
what
olivia
oh
yes
george
h
fellow
there
is
rather
a
longer
silence
this
time
george
continues
to
hope
that
he
is
appearing
casual
and
unconcerned
he
stands
looking
at
olivia
work
for
a
moment
george
nearly
finished
olivia
very
nearly
are
my
scissors
there
george
looking
round
scissors
olivia
ah
here
they
are
george
where
are
you
going
to
put
olivia
as
if
really
wondering
i
do
quite
know
i
thought
of
this
room
but
i
not
quite
sure
george
brighten
the
room
up
a
bit
olivia
yes
george
walking
over
to
the
present
curtains
h
they
a
bit
faded
olivia
shaking
out
hers
and
looking
at
them
critically
sometimes
i
think
i
love
them
and
sometimes
i
not
quite
sure
george
best
way
is
to
hang
up
and
see
how
you
like
then
always
take
down
again
olivia
that
rather
a
good
idea
george
george
best
way
olivia
yes
i
think
we
might
do
that
the
only
thing
is
she
hesitates
george
what
olivia
well
the
carpet
and
the
chairs
and
the
cushions
and
things
george
what
about
olivia
well
if
we
had
new
curtains
george
you
want
a
new
carpet
eh
olivia
doubtfully
y
yes
well
new
anyhow
george
h
well
why
not
olivia
oh
but
george
with
an
awkward
laugh
we
not
so
hard
up
as
all
that
you
know
olivia
no
i
suppose
not
thoughtfully
i
suppose
it
would
mean
that
i
should
have
to
go
up
to
london
for
them
that
rather
a
nuisance
george
extremely
casual
oh
i
do
know
we
might
go
up
together
one
day
olivia
well
of
course
if
we
up
for
anything
else
we
could
just
look
about
us
and
see
if
we
could
find
what
we
want
george
that
what
i
meant
there
is
another
silence
george
is
wondering
whether
to
come
to
closer
quarters
with
the
great
question
olivia
oh
by
the
way
george
george
yes
olivia
innocently
i
told
brian
and
i
expect
he
tell
dinah
that
pim
had
made
a
mistake
about
the
name
george
astonished
you
told
brian
that
pim
olivia
yes
i
told
him
that
the
whole
thing
was
a
mistake
it
seemed
the
simplest
way
george
olivia
then
you
mean
that
brian
and
dinah
think
that
that
we
have
been
married
all
the
time
olivia
yes
they
both
think
so
now
george
coming
close
to
her
olivia
does
that
mean
that
you
thinking
of
marrying
me
olivia
at
your
old
registry
office
george
eagerly
yes
olivia
george
yes
olivia
do
you
want
me
to
much
george
my
darling
you
know
i
do
olivia
a
little
apprehensive
we
should
have
to
do
it
very
quietly
george
of
course
darling
nobody
need
know
at
all
we
do
anybody
to
know
and
now
that
you
put
brian
and
dinah
off
the
scent
by
telling
them
that
pim
made
a
mistake
he
breaks
off
and
says
admiringly
that
was
very
clever
of
you
olivia
i
should
never
have
thought
of
that
olivia
innocently
no
darling
you
do
think
it
was
wrong
george
george
his
verdict
an
innocent
deception
perfectly
harmless
olivia
yes
dear
that
was
what
i
thought
about
about
what
i
was
doing
george
then
you
will
come
she
nods
and
if
we
happen
to
see
the
carpet
or
anything
that
you
want
olivia
oh
what
fun
george
beaming
and
a
wedding
lunch
at
the
carlton
what
she
nods
eagerly
and
and
a
bit
of
a
honeymoon
in
paris
olivia
oh
george
george
hungrily
give
us
a
kiss
old
girl
olivia
lovingly
george
she
holds
up
her
cheek
to
him
he
kisses
it
and
then
suddenly
takes
her
in
his
arms
george
do
ever
leave
me
old
girl
olivia
affectionately
do
ever
send
me
away
old
boy
george
fervently
i
wo
awkwardly
i
i
do
think
i

going
up
impetuously
to
him
give
one
too
george
brian
wo
mind
brian
really
dinah
you
are
the
limit
george
formally
but
enjoying
it
do
you
mind
mr
strange
brian
a
little
uncomfortably
oh

risk
it
dinah
he
kisses
her
dinah
triumphantly
to
brian
did
you
notice
that
one
that
was
just
an
ordinary
affectionate
kiss
it
was
a
special
bless
you
my
children
one
to
george
was
it
olivia
you
do
talk
nonsense
darling
dinah

i
so
happy
now
that
pim
has
relented
about
your
first
husband
george
catches
olivia
eye
and
smiles
she
smiles
back
but
they
are
different
smiles
george
the
actor

brian

now
that

we
love
each
other
and
sit
next
to
each
other
when

a
hash
of
things
dinah

i
mean
keeping
on
coming
like
that
and
if
you
look
at
it
all
round
well
for
all
he
had
to
say
he
need
really
have
come
at
all
olivia
smiling
to
herself
i
should
quite
say
that
dinah
she
stands
up
and
shakes
out
the
curtains

i
say

they
jolly
olivia
demurely

george
to
olivia
brian
is
just
telling
george
about
the
five
shillings
he
got
in
the
post
office
george
george
from
the
terrace
coming
he
hurries
in
the
model
husband
brian
follows
olivia
oh
george
just
hang
these
up
for
me
will
you
george
of
course
darling
i
get
the
steps
from
the
library
he
hurries
out
brian
takes
out
his
sketching
block
it
is
obvious
that
his
five
shillings
has
turned
the
scale
he
bows
to
dinah
he
kisses
hand
with
an
air
he
motions
to
dinah
to
be
seated
dinah
impressed
what
is
it
brian
beginning
to
draw
portrait
of
lady
strange
george
hurries
in
with
the
steps
and
gets
to
work
there
is
a
great
deal
of
curtain
and
for
the
moment
he
becomes
slightly
involved
in
it
however
by
draping
it
over
his
head
and
shoulders
he
manages
to
get
successfully
up
the
steps
there
we
may
leave
him
but
we
have
not
quite
finished
with
pim
it
is
a
matter
of
honour
with
him
now
that
he
should
get
his
little
story
quite
accurate
before
passing
out
of
the
mardens
life
for
ever
so
he
comes
back
for
the
last
time
for
the
last
time
we
see
his
head
at
the
window
he
whispers
to
olivia
pim
marden
i
just
remembered
his
name
was
polwittle
henry
he
goes
off
happily
a
curious
family
the
mardens
perhaps
somebody
else
would
have
committed
bigamy
if
he
had
not
remembered
in
time
that
it
was
ernest
ernest
yes
now
he
can
go
back
with
an
easy
conscience
to
the
trevors

rather
an
obvious

almost
as
soon
as

get
the
letter

always
hopeful
perhaps
he
did
catch
the
boat
that
he
expected
to
would
he
have
cabled
from
somewhere
on
the
way
kate
you
ca
depend
on
cables
nowadays
do
know
what
are
we
to
do
cyril
norwood
you
know
what
i
always
wanted
you
to
do
he
takes
her
hands
come
away
with
me
kate
doubtfully
and
let
dennis
come
home
and
find
an
empty
house
norwood
eagerly
you
are
nothing
to
him
and
he
is
nothing
to
you
a
after
you
been
engaged
to
each
other
for
a
week
and
hours
afterwards
he
is
sent
out
to
india
and
you
seen
him
since
kate
yes
i
keep
telling
myself
that
norwood
the
world
may
say
that
you
his
wife
and
he
your
husband
but
what
do
you
know
of
him
he
wo
even
be
the
boy
you
married
he
be
a
stranger
whom
you
hardly
recognise
and
you
are
the
girl
married
you
a
woman
now
and
you
just
beginning
to
learn
what
love
is
come
with
kate

he
been
fighting
for
us
and
to
come
home

four
years
of
exile
and
find
norwood
exile
that
making
much
too
much
of
it
he
come
through
the
war
safely
and
he
probably
had
what
he
call
a
topping
good
time
like
enough
he
been
in
love
times
himself
since
on
leave
in
india
and
that
sort
of
thing
india
well
you
should
read
kipling
kate
i
wonder
of
course
as
you
say
i
do
know
him
but
i
feel
that
we
should
be
happier
afterwards
if
we
were
quite
straight
about
it
and
told
him
just
what
had
happened
if
he
had
been
doing
what
you
say
he
would
understand
and
perhaps
be
glad
of
it
norwood
uneasily
really
darling
it
hardly
a
thing
you
can
talk
over
calmly
with
a
husband
even
if
he
we
do
want
any
unpleasantness
and
er
taking
her
hands

about

he
said
because
i
could
tell
you
an
interesting
story
about
him
he
said
if
you
care
to
norwood
wheeling
round
furiously
look
here
sir
we
better
have
it
out
quite
plainly
i
do
want
any
veiled
insults
and
sneers
from
you
i
admit
that
an
unfortunate
situation
has
arisen
but
we
must
look
facts
in
the
face
you
may
be
camberley
husband
but
she
has
not
seen
you
for
four
years
and
well
she
and
i
love
each
other

neglected
her

i
could
come
home
for
very
well
and
norwood
what

you
going
to
do
dennis
pleasantly
well
what
do
you
suggest
norwood
taken
aback
really
sir
i
er
dennis
you
see
i
feel
so
out
of
it
all

been
leading
such
a
nasty
uncivilised
life
for
the
last
four
years
i
really
hardly
know
what
is
what
is
being
done
now
have
been
mixing
in
society
making
munitions
norwood
stiffly
i
have
been
engaged
on
important
work
for
the
government
of
a
confidential
nature
dennis
you
as
i
was
saying
have
been
mixing
in
society
engaged
on
important
work
for
the
government
of
a
confidential
nature
norwood
it
was
my
great
regret
that
i
had
no
opportunity
of
enlisting
dennis
with
no
opportunity
as
i
was
about
to
say
of
enlisting
but
with
many
opportunities
fortunately
of
making
love
to
my
wife
norwood
now
look
here
camberley
i
already
told
you
dennis
soothing
him
but
my
dear
norwood
i
only
doing
what
you
said
i
looking
facts
in
the
face
surprised
you
ashamed
of
having
made
love
to
my
wife
are
you
norwood
impatiently
what
are
you
going
to
do
that
all
that
matters
between
you
and
me
what
are
you
going
to
do
dennis
well
that
was
what
i
was
going
to
ask
you
you
so
much
more
in
the
swim
than
i
am
earnestly
what
being
done
in
society
just
now
you
must
have
heard
a
good
deal
of
gossip
about
it
all
your
friends
who
were
also
engaged
on
important
work
of
a
confidential
nature
with
no
opportunity
of
enlisting
do
they
tell
you
their
own
experiences
what
the
husbands
been
doing
lately
when
they
came
back
from
the
front
norwood
advancing
on
him
angrily
now
once
and
for
all
sir
kate
comes
in
with
a
hat
in
each
hand
calling
to
norwood
as
she
comes

two
hats

come
back

puts
the
hats

to
the
other
you
dennis
smiling
oh
we
quite
old
friends
norwood
going
to
her
i
told
him
kate
he
takes
her
hands
and
tries
to
look
defiantly
at
dennis
though
he
is
not
feeling
like
that
at
all
kate
looking
anxiously
at
dennis
what
are
you
going
to
do
she
can
hardly
make
him
out
he
is
different
from
the
husband
who
left
her
four
years
ago
dennis
well
that
what
cyril
keeps
asking
me
to
norwood

my
calling
you

such
an
old
friend
of
my
wife

unable
to
make
him
out

is
frightened

down
and

it
over
in
a
friendly
way

wish
dennis
that
all
right
kate

will
not
let
her
come
too
close

to
feet

back
a
stranger

jerking
his
head
at

her
eyes

feel
you
know
all
about
kate
i
we
she
is
unhappy
norwood
we
have
discovered
that
we
love
each
other
taking
her
hands
my
darling
one
this
is
distressing
for
you
let
dennis
sharply
it
would
be
distressing
for
her
if
you
keep
messing
her
about
why
the
devil
ca
you
sit
on
a
chair
by
yourself
norwood
indignantly
really
kate
freeing
herself
from
him
and
moving
to
the
extreme
end
of
the
sofa
what
are
you
going
to
do
dennis
dennis
looking
at
them
thoughtfully
his
chin
on
his
hand
i
know
it
difficult
i
do
want
to
do
anything
melodramatic
i
mean
to
kate
it
would
really
help
matters
if
i
did
shoot
him
would
it
kate
looks
at
him
without
saying
anything
trying
to
understand
this
new
man
who
has
come
into
her
life
norwood
swallows
and
tries
very
hard
to
say
something
norwood
i
i
dennis
turning
to
him
do
think
so
do
you
norwood
i
i
dennis
no
i
quite
sure
you
right
it
would
really
help
it
is
difficult
is
it
you
see
to
kate
love
he
waits
a
moment
for
her
to
say
it
if
she
will
but
she
only
looks
at
him
and
says
loves
but
at
the
same
time
i
your
husband
he
walks
up
and
down
thoughtfully
and
then
says
suddenly
to
norwood
i
tell
you
what
i
fight
you
for
her
norwood
trying
to
be
firm
i
think
we
better
leave
this
nonsense
out
of
it
dennis
pleasantly
they
fight
in
the
twentieth
century
too
norwood
perhaps
you
had
heard
what
we
been
doing
these
last
four
years
oh
quite
a
lot
of
it
well
norwood
you
do
wish
me
to
believe
that
you
serious
dennis
perfectly
swords
pistols
fists
what
would
you
like
norwood
i
do
not
propose
to
indulge
in
an
undignified
scuffle
for
the
er
lady
of
my
heart
dennis
cheerfully
nothing
doing
in
scuffles
eh
all
right
then
i
toss
you
for
her
norwood
now
you
merely
being
vulgar
to
kate
my
dear
she
motions
him
back
with
her
hand
but
does
not
take
her
eyes
off
dennis
dennis
really
norwood
you
a
little
hard
to
please
if
you
do
like
my
suggestions
perhaps
you
will
make
one
of
your
own
norwood
this
is
obviously
a
matter
in
which
it
is
for
the
er
lady
to
choose
dennis
you
think
camberley
should
choose
between
us
norwood
certainly
dennis
what
do
you
say

he
spins
a
coin
puts
it
on
the
back
of
his
hand
and
says
to
norwood
call
norwood
what
on
dennis
choice
of
innings
norwood
i
never

have
first
knock
norwood
bewildered
what

five
minutes
in
which
to
lay
your
case
before
camberley
he
looks
at

five
minutes
and
then
i
shall
come
back

there
a
fire
in
the
kate
kate
smiling
in
spite
of
herself
a
it

shall
light
it
to
norwood
that
will
make
the
room
nice
and
warm
for
you
by
the
time
you
finished
he
goes
to
the
door
and
says
again
five
minutes
there
is
an
awkward
silence
after
he
is
gone
kate
waits
for
norwood
to
say
something
but
norwood
does
know
in
the
least
what
is
expected
of
him
norwood
looking
anxiously
at
the
door
what
the
fellow
game
eh
kate
game
norwood
yes
what
he
up
to
kate
is
he
up
to
anything
norwood
i
do
like
it
why
the
devil
did
he
choose
to
come
back
if
he
waited
another
week
we
have
been
safely
away
together
what
his
game
i
wonder
he
walks
up
and
down
worrying
it
out
kate
i
do
think
he
playing
a
game
he
just
giving
me
my
chance
norwood
what
chance
kate
a
chance
to
decide
between
you
norwood
you
decided
that
kate
you
had
a
year
to
think
about
it
in
and
you
decided
we
love
each
other
you
coming
away
with
me
that
all
settled
only
what
the
deuce
is
he
up
to
kate
sitting
down
and
talking
to
herself
you
quite
right
about
my
not
knowing
him
how
one
rushed
into
marriage
in
those
early
days
of
the
war
knowing
nothing
about
each
other
and
then
they
come
back
and
even
the
little
one
thought
one
did
know
is
different
i
suppose
he
feels
the
same
about
me
norwood
to
himself
damn
him
kate
after
a
pause
well
cyril
norwood
looking
sharply
round
at
her
well
kate
we
have
got
very
long
norwood
looking
at
his
watch
he
really
means
to
come
back
in
five
minutes
kate
you
heard
him
say
so
norwood
going
up
to
her
and
speaking
eagerly
what
the
matter
with
slipping
out
now

got
a
hat
here
we
can
slip
out
quietly
he
wo
hear
us
he
come
back
and
find
us
gone
well
what
can
he
do
probably
he
hang
about
for
a
bit
and
then
go
to
his
club
have
a
bit
of
dinner
ring
up
your
maid
get
her
to
meet
you
with
some
things

whole
business
simmer
down
a
bit
we
do
want
any
melodramatic
nonsense
kate
go
out
now
and
not
wait
for
him
to
have
five
minutes
norwood
impatiently
what
does
he
with
five
minutes
the
of
it
to
him
just
to
take
a
pathetic
farewell
of
you
and
pretend
that
you
ruined
his
life
when
all
the
time
he
chuckling
in
his
sleeve
at
having
got
rid

fooling
around
with
the

to
be
mixed
up

any
scandal
of
sort
no
the
best
thing
we
can
do
i
speaking
for
sake

is
to
slip
off
quietly
while
we
got
the
chance
we
can
and
explain
all
that
we
want
to
explain
kate
looking
wonderingly

five

uncomfortably
well

want
to
look
at
you
i
seen
you
like
that
for
four
years
do
move
i
been
in
some
dreary
places
but
you
been
with
me
most
of
the
time
just
let
have
a
last
look
kate
a
last
look
dennis
yes
kate
you
saying
to
me
dennis
i
do
know
whether
it
to
you
kate
to
the
girl
who
has
been
with
me
these
last
four
years
was
that
you
kate
dropping
her
eyes
i
do
know
dennis
dennis
i
wish
to
god
i
was
your
husband
kate
what
would
you
do
if
you
were
my
husband
dennis
make
love
to
you
kate
ca
you
do
that
now
dennis
being
your
husband
rather
handicaps
me
you
know
i
never
really
stood
a
chance
against
the
other
fellow
kate
i
was
to
choose
between
you
you
said
you
think
that
i
have
already
made
up
my
mind
dennis
smiling
i
think
so
kate
and
chosen
him
dennis
shaking
his
head
oh
no
kate
surprised
you
think
i
have
chosen
dennis
nodding
m
kate
indignantly
really
dennis
considering
that
i
had
practically
arranged
to
run
away
with
him
twenty
minutes
ago
you
must
think
me
very
fickle
dennis
not
fickle
imaginative
kate
what
do
you
mean
and
why
are
you
so
certain
that
i
am
going
to
choose
you
and
why
in
that
case
did
you
talk
about
taking
a
last
look
at
me
and
what
dennis
of
course
we
only
got
five
minutes
but
i
think
that
if
you
asked
your
questions
one
at
a
time
kate
smiling
well
you
need
them
all
together
dennis
all
right
then
one
at
a
time
why
am
i
certain
that
you
will
choose
me
because
for
the
first
time
in
your
life
you
have
just
been
alone
with
cyril
norwood
that
what
i
meant
by
saying
you
were
imaginative
the
norwood
you
been
thinking
yourself
in
love
with
does
exist
i
certain
that
you
seen
him
for
the
first
time
in
these
last
few
minutes
why
the
archangel
gabriel
would
have
made
a
hash
of
a
five
minutes
like
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
him
to
have
said
the
right
thing
to
you
norwood
good
lord
he
stand
a
chance
you
were
judging
him
all
the
time
were
you
kate
thoughtfully
you
very
clever
dennis
dennis
cheerfully
four
years
study
of
the
turkish
character
kate
but
how
do
you
know
i
not
judging
all
the
time
dennis
of
course
you
are
but
there
all
the
difference
in
the
world
between
judging
a
stranger
like
me
and
judging
the
man
you
thought
you
were
in
love
with
kate
you
a
stranger
to
me
dennis
i
know
that
why
i
said
to
the
girl
who
had
been
with
me
these
last
four
years
the
girl
i
had
married
well
i
said
to
her
you
not
my
wife
any
longer
kate
but
if
you
mind
pretending
that
i
not
your
husband
and
just
give
me
a
chance
of
making
love
to
you
well
that
all
i
want
kate
you
very
generous
dennis
dennis
no
i
not
i
very
much
in
love
and
for
a
man
very
much
in
love
i
being
rather
less
of
a
silly
ass
than
usual
why
should
you
love
me
you
fell
in
love
with
my
uniform
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
i
was
ordered
out
and
you
fell
in
love
with
the
departing
hero
after
that
well
i
had
four
years
alone
in
which
to
think
about
and
you
had
four
years
with
other
men
in
which
to
forget
is
it
any
wonder
that
norwood
comes
in
norwood
roughly
well
dennis
you
arrive
just
in
time
norwood
i
was
talking
too
much
to
kate
camberley
we
are
both
at
your
disposal
will
you
choose
between
us
which
one
is
to
have
the
happiness
of
serving
you
norwood
holding
out
his
hand
to
her
and
speaking
in
the
voice
of
the
proprietor
kate
kate
goes
slowly
up
to
him
with
her
hand
held
out
kate
shaking
norwood
hand
norwood
norwood
astounded
kate
to
dennis
you
devil
dennis
and
only
a
moment
ago
i
was
comparing
you
to
the
archangel
gabriel
norwood
sneeringly
to
kate
so
you
going
to
be
a
loving
wife
to
him
after
all
dennis
tapping
him
kindly
on
the
shoulder
you
remember
what
i
said
about
mesopotamia
norwood
pulling
himself
together
hastily
camberley
i
can
only
hope
that
you
will
be
happy
he
goes
out
with
dignity
dennis
closing
the
door
well
there
we
agree
he
comes
back
to
her
kate
what
a
stupid
little
fool
i
have
been
she
holds
out
her
arms
to
him
dennis
dennis
retreating
in
mock
alarm
oh
no
you
do
he
shakes
a
finger
at
her
we
not
going
to
rush
it
time
kate
reproachfully
dennis
dennis
i
think
you
should
call
me
camberley
kate
with
a
smile
camberley
dennis
that
better
now
our
courtship
begins
bowing
low
madam
will
you
do
me
the
great
honour
of
dining
with
me
this
evening
kate
curtseying
i
shall
be
charmed
dennis
then

us
hasten
the
carriage
waits
kate
holding
up
the
two
hats
which
of
these
two
chapeaux
do
you
prefer
camberley
dennis
might
i
express
a
preference
for
the
black
one
with
the
pink
roses
kate
it
is
very
elegant
is
it
not
she
puts
it
on
dennis
vastly
becoming
upon
my
life
i
might
mention
that
i
am
staying
at
the
club
is
your
ladyship
doing
anything
kate
nothing
of
any
great
importance
he
offers
his
arm
and
she
takes
it
dennis
as
they
go
to
the
door
then
perhaps
i
may
be
permitted
to
call
round
morning
about
eleven
and
make
inquiries
as
to
your
ladyship
health
kate

true
melisande
kingsley
mother

tennyson
jane
nodding
kingsley
that
right
knowle
well
it
the

thing
i
know
when
mother
used
to
call
me
i
used
to
come
running
up
saying
what
is
it
mummy
darling
and
even
if
it
was
anything
upstairs
like
a
handkerchief
or
a
pair
of
socks
to
be
mended
i
used
to
trot
off
happily
saying
to
myself
do
noble
things
not
dream
them
all
day
long
melisande
i
am
sorry
mother
what
is
the
noble
thing
you

knowle
well
now
you
see
i
forgotten
if
only
you

dear
melisande
i
was
looking
out
into
the
night
it
a
wonderful
night
midsummer
night
knowle
midsummer
night
and
now
i
suppose
the
days
will
start
drawing
in
and
we
shall
have
winter
upon
us
before
we
know
where
we
are
all
these
changes
of
the
seasons
are
very
inconsiderate
to
an
invalid
ah
now
i
remember
what
i
wanted
dear
can
you
find
me
another
cushion
anderson
considers
it
most
important
that
the
small
of
the
back
should
be
well
supported
after
a
meal
indicating
the
place
just
here
dear
jane
jumping
up
with
the
cushion
from
her
chair
let
me
aunt
mary
knowle
thank
you
jane
just
here
please
jane
arranges
it
jane
is
that
right
knowle
thank
you
dear
i
only
do
it
for
anderson
sake
jane
goes
back
to
her
book
and
melisande
goes
back
to
her
midsummer
night
there
is
silence
for
a
little
knowle
oh
sandy
sandy
jane
melisande
melisande
coming
patiently
down
to
them
yes
mother
knowle
oh
sandy
i
just
remembered
melisande
shudders
what
is
it
darling
child
are
you
cold
that
comes
of
standing
by
the
open
window
in
a
treacherous
climate
like
this
close
the
window
and
come
and
sit
down
properly
melisande
it
a
wonderful
night
mother
midsummer
night
i
not
cold
knowle
but
you
shuddered
i
distinctly
saw
you
shudder
you
see
her
jane
jane
i
afraid
i
was
looking
aunt
mary
melisande
i
did
shudder
because
i
was
cold
i
shuddered
because
you
will
keep
calling
me
by
that
horrible
name
i
shudder
every
time
i
hear
it
knowle
surprised
what
name
sandy
melisande
there
it
is
again
oh
why
did
you
christen
me
by
such
a
wonderful
beautiful
magical
name
as
melisande
if
you
were
going
to
call
me
sandy
knowle
well
dear
as
i
think
i
told
you
that
was
a
mistake
of
your
father
i
suppose
he
got
it
out
of
some
book
i
should
certainly
never
have
agreed
to
it
if
i
had
heard
him
distinctly
i
thought
he
said
millicent
after
your
aunt
milly
and
not
being
very
well
at
the
time
and
leaving
it
all
to
him
i
never
really
knew
about
it
until
it
was
too
late
to
do
anything
i
did
say
to
your
father
ca
we
christen
her
again
but
there
was
nothing
in
the
prayer
book
about
it
except
riper
years
and
nobody
seemed
to
know
when
riper
years
began
besides
we
were
all
calling
you
sandy
then
i
think
sandy
is
a
very
pretty
name
do
you
jane
jane
oh
but
do
you
think
melisande
is
beautiful
aunt
mary
i
mean
really
beautiful
knowle
well
it
never
seems
to
me
quite
respectable
not
for
a
young
girl
in
a
christian
house
it
makes
me
think
of
the
sort
of
person
who
meets
a
strange
young
man
to
whom
she
has
never
been
introduced
and
talks
to
him
in
a
forest
with
her
hair
coming
down
they
find
her
afterwards
floating
in
a
pool
not
at
all
the
thing
one
wants
for
one
daughter
jane
oh
but
how
thrilling
it
sounds
knowle
well
i
think
you
are
safer
with
jane
dear
your
mother
knew
what
she
was
about
and
if
i
can
save
my
only
child
from
floating
in
a
pool
by
calling
her
sandy
i
certainly
think
it
is
my
duty
to
do
so
melisande
to
her
self
ecstatically
melisande
knowle
to
melisande
oh
and
talking
about
floating
in
a
pool
reminds
me
about
the
at
dinner
you
heard
what
your
father
said
you
must
give
cook
a
good
talking
to
in
the
morning
she
has
been
getting
very
careless
lately
i
do
know
what
come
over
her
melisande
come
over
her
when
were
over
her
everything
was
all
right
you
know
all
about
housekeeping
you
take
an
interest
in
it
i
do
i
hate
it
how
can
you
expect
the
house
to
be
run
properly
when
they
all
know
i
hate
it
why
did
you
ever
give
it
up
and
make
me
do
it
when
you
know
how
i
hate
it
knowle
well
you
must
learn
not
to
hate
it
i
sure
jane
here
does
hate
it
and
her
mother
is
always
telling
me
what
a
great
help
she
is
melisande
warningly
it
no
good
your
saying
you
like
it
jane
after
what
you
told
me
yesterday
jane
i
do
like
it
but
it
does
make
me
miserable
doing
it
but
then
i
different
i
not
romantic
like
melisande
melisande
one
does
need
to
be
very
romantic
not
to
want
to
talk
about
on
a
night
like
this
knowle
well
i
only
thinking
of
you
sandy
not
of
myself
if
i
thought
about
myself
i
should
disregard
all
the
warnings
that
anderson
keeps
giving
me
and
i
should
insist
on
doing
the
housekeeping
just
as
i
always
used
to
but
i
have
to
think
of
you
i
want
to
see
you
married
to
some
nice
steady
young
man
before
i
die
my
handkerchief
jane
jane
gets
up
and
gives
her
her
handkerchief
from
the
other
end
of
the
sofa
before
i
die
she
touches
her
eyes
with
her
handkerchief
and
no
nice
young
man
will
want
to
marry
you
if
you
have
learnt
how
to
look
after
his
house
for
him
melisande
contemptuously
if
that
marriage
i
shall
never
get
married
jane
shocked
melisande
darling
knowle
anderson
was
saying
only
yesterday
trying
to
make
me
more
cheerful
why
knowle
he
said
you
live
another
hundred
years
yet
anderson
i
said
i
do
to
live
another
hundred
years
i
only
want
to
live
until
my
dear
daughter
melisande
i
did
say
sandy
to
him
because
it
seemed
rather
familiar
i
only
want
to
live
until
my
daughter
melisande
is
happily
married
to
some
nice
steady
young
man
do
this
for
me
anderson
i
said
and
i
shall
be
your
lifelong
debtor
he
promised
to
do
his
best
it
was
then
that
he
mentioned
about
the
cushion
in
the
small
of
the
back
after
meals
and
so
do
forget
to
tell
cook
about
the
will
you
dear
melisande
i
will
tell
her
mother
knowle
that
right
i
like
a
man
to
be
interested
in
his
food
i
hope
both
your
husbands
sandy
and
jane
will
take
a
proper
interest
in
what
they
eat
you
will
find
that
after
you
have
been
married
some
years
and
told
each
other
everything
you
did
and
saw
before
you
met
there
is
really
anything
to
talk
about
at
meals
except
food
and
you
must
talk
i
hope
you
will
both
remember
that
nothing
breaks
up
the
home
so
quickly
as
silent
meals
of
course
breakfast
matter
because
he
has
his
paper
then
and
after
you
have
said
is
there
anything
in
the
paper
dear
and
he
has
said
no
then
he
does
expect
anything
more
i
wonder
sometimes
why
they
go
on
printing
the
newspapers
i
been
married
twenty
years
and
there
has
never
been
anything
in
the
paper
yet
melisande
oh
mother
i
hate
to
hear
you
talking
about
marriage
like
that
was
there
ever
kind
of
romance
between
you
and
father
not
even
when
he
was
wooing
you
was
there
ever
one
magic
midsummer
morning
when
you
saw
suddenly
a
livelier
emerald
twinkle
in
the
grass
a
purer
sapphire
melt
into
the
sea
was
there
ever
one
passionate
ecstatic
moment
when
once
he
drew
with
one
long
kiss
my
whole
soul
through
my
lips
as
sunlight
drinketh
dew
or
did
you
talk
about
the
time
jane
eagerly
tell
us
about
it
aunt
mary
knowle
well
dear
there
is
very
much
to
tell
i
am
quite
sure
that
we
never
drank
dew
together
or
anything
like
that
as
sandy
suggests
and
it
was
by
the
sea
at
all
it
was
at
surbiton
he
used
to
come
down
from
london
with
his
racquet
and
play
tennis
with
us
and
then
he
would
stay
on
to
supper
sometimes
and
then
after
supper
we
would
go
into
the
garden
together
it
was
quite
dark
then
but
everything
smelt
so
beautifully
i
shall
always
remember
it
and
we
talked
oh
i
do
know
what
about
but
i
knew
somehow
that
i
should
marry
him
one
day
i
do
think
knew
he
was
sure
and
then
he
came
to
a
subscription
dance
one
evening
i
think
mother
your
grandmother
guessed
that
that
was
to
be
my
great
evening
because
she
was
very
particular
about
my
dress
and
i
remember
she
sent
me
upstairs
again
before
we
started
because
i
had
got
the
right
pair
of
shoes
on
rather
a
tight
pair
however
i
put
them
on
and
there
was
a
hansom
outside
the
hall
and
it
was
our
last
dance
together
and
he
said
shall
we
sit
it
out
miss
bagot
well
of
course
i
was
only
too
glad
to
and
we
sat
it
out
in
the
hansom
driving
all
round
surbiton
and
what
your
grandmother
would
have
said
i
do
know
but
of
course
i
never
told
her
and
when
we
got
home
after
the
dance
i
went
up
to
her
room
as
soon
as
i
got
my
shoes
off
and
said
mother
i
have
some
wonderful
news
for
you
and
she
said
mr
knowle
henry
and
i
said
rather
you
know
and
wanting
to
cry
and
she
said
oh
my
darling
child
and
jane
where
my
handkerchief
it
has
dropped
off
the
sofa
and
jane
picks
it
up
thank
you
dear
she
dabs
her
eyes
well
that
really
all
you
know
except
that
she
dabs
her
eyes
again
i
afraid
feeling
rather
overcome
i
sure
anderson
would
say
it
was
very
bad
for
me
to
feel
overcome
your
poor
dear
grandmother
jane
dear
why
did
you
ask
me
to
tell
you
all
this
i
must
go
away
and
compose
myself
before
your
uncle
and
coote
come
in
i
do
know
what
i
should
do
if
coote
saw
me
like
this
she
begins
to
get
up
and
after
calling
me
a
spartan
mother
only
yesterday
because
i
said
that
if
any
nice
steady
young
man
came
along
and
took
my
own
dear
little
girl
away
from
me
i
should
bear
the
terrible
wrench
in
silence
rather
than
cause
either
of
them
a
moment
remorse
she
is
up
now
there
jane
shall
i
come
with
you
knowle
no
dear
not
just
now
let
me
be
by
myself
for
a
little
she
turns
back
suddenly
at
the
door
oh
perhaps
later
on
when
the
men
come
from
the
dear
jane
you
might
join
me
with
your
uncle
henry
if
the
opportunity
occurs
but
only
if
it
occurs
of
course
she
goes
jane
coming
back
to
the
sofa
poor
aunt
mary
it
always
seems
so
queer
that
one
mother
and
aunts
and
people
should
have
had
their
romances
too
melisande
do
you
call
that
romance
jane
tennis
and
subscription
dances
and
wearing
tight
shoes
jane
awkwardly
well
no
darling
not
romance
of
course
but
you
know
what
i
mean
melisande
just
think
of
the
commonplace
little
story
which
mother
has
just
told
us
and
compare
it
with
any
of
the
of
history
is
it
pitiful
jane
that
people
should
be
satisfied
now
with
so
little
jane
yes
darling
very
very
sad
but
i
do
think
aunt
mary
melisande
i
am
not
blaming
mother
it
is
the
same
almost
everywhere
nowadays
there
is
no
romance
left
jane
no
darling
of
course
i
am
not
romantic
like
you
but
i
do
agree
with
you
it
is
very
sad
somehow
there
is
no
she
searches
for
the
right
word
no
left
melisande
just
think
of
the
average
marriage
it
makes
one
shudder
jane
doing
her
best
positively
shudder
melisande
he
meets
her
at
she
shudders
a
subscription
dance
or
a
tennis
party
she
shudders
again
or
at
he
calls
upon
her
mother
perhaps
in
a
top
hat
perhaps
tragically
even
in
a
bowler
hat
jane
a
bowler
hat
one
shudders
melisande
her
mother
makes
tactful
inquiries
about
his
income
discovers
that
he
is
a
nice
steady
young
man
and
decides
that
he
shall
marry
her
daughter
he
is
asked
to
come
again
he
is
invited
to
parties
it
is
understood
that
he
is
falling
in
love
with
the
daughter
the
rest
of
the
family
are
encouraged
to
leave
them
alone
together
if
the
opportunity
occurs
jane
contemptuously
but
of
course
only
if
it
occurs
jane
awkwardly
yes
dear
melisande
one
day
he
proposes
to
her
jane
to
herself
ecstatically
oh
melisande
he
stutters
out
a
few
unbeautiful
words
which
she
takes
to
be
a
proposal
she
goes
and
tells
mother
he
goes
and
tells
father
they
are
engaged
they
talk
about
each
other
as
my
fiancé
perhaps
they
are
engaged
for
months
and
months
jane
years
and
years
sometimes
melisande
melisande
for
years
and
years
and
wherever
they
go
people
make
silly
little
jokes
about
them
and
cough
very
loudly
if
they
go
into
a
room
where
the
two
of
them
are
and
then
they
get
married
at
last
and
everybody
comes
and
watches
them
get
married
and
makes
more
silly
jokes
and
they
go
away
for
what
they
call
a
honeymoon
and
they
tell
everybody
they
shout
it
out
in
the
newspapers
they
are
going
for
their
honeymoon
and
then
they
come
back
and
start
talking
about
oh
jane
it
horrible
jane
horrible
darling
with
a
french
air
but
what
would
you
melisande
in
a
low
thrilling
voice
what
would
i
ah
what
would
i
jane
jane
because
you
see
sandy
i
mean
melisande
you
see
darling
this
the
twentieth
century
and
melisande
sometimes
i
see
him
clothed
in
mail
riding
beneath
my
lattice
window
all
in
the
blue
unclouded
weather
shone
the
saddle
leather
the
helmet
and
the
helmet
feather
burned
like
one
burning
flame
together
as
he
rode
down
to
camelot
and
from
his
blazoned
baldric
slung
a
mighty
silver
bugle
hung
and
as
he
rode
his
armour
rung
as
he
rode
down
to
camelot
jane
i
know
dear
but
of
course
they
nowadays
melisande
and
as
he
rides
beneath
my
room
singing
to
himself
i
wave
one
lily
hand
to
him
from
my
lattice
and
toss
him
down
a
gage
a
gage
for
him
to
wear
in
his
helm
a
rose
perhaps
just
a
rose
jane
awed
no
melisande
would
you
really
wave
a
lily
hand
to
him
she
waves
one
i
mean
would
it
be
rather
know
rather
forward
melisande
forward
jane
upset
well
i
mean
well
of
course
i
suppose
it
was
different
in
those
days
melisande
how
else
could
he
know
that
i
loved
him
how
else
could
he
wear
my
gage
in
his
helm
when
he
rode
to
battle
jane
well
of
course
there
that
melisande
and
then
when
he
has
slain
his
enemies
in
battle
he
comes
back
to
me
i
knot
my
sheets
together
so
as
to
form
a
rope
for
i
have
been
immured
in
my
room
and
i
let
myself
down
to
him
he
places
me
on
the
saddle
in
front
of
him
and
we
ride
forth
together
into
the
world
together
for
always
jane
a
little
uncomfortably
you
do
get
i
suppose
darling
or
do
you
er
melisande
we
stop
at
a
little
hermitage
on
the
way
and
a
good
priest
marries
us
jane
relieved
ah
yes
melisande
and
sometimes
he
is
not
in
armour
he
is
a
prince
from
fairyland
my
father
is
king
of
a
neighbouring
country
a
country
which
is
sorely
troubled
by
a
dragon
jane
by
a
what
dear
melisande
a
dragon
jane
oh
yes
of
course
melisande
the
king
my
father
offers
my
hand
and
half
his
kingdom
to
anybody
who
will
slay
the
monster
a
prince
who
happens
to
be
passing
through
the
country
essays
the
adventure
alas
the
dragon
devours
him
jane
oh
melisande
that
is
one
melisande
my
eyes
have
barely
rested
upon
him
he
has
aroused
no
emotion
in
my
heart
jane
oh
i
so
glad
melisande
another
prince
steps
forward
impetuously
he
rushes
upon
the
fiery
monster
alas
he
likewise
is
consumed
jane
sympathetically
poor
fellow
melisande
and
then
one
evening
a
beautiful
and
modest
youth
in
blue
and
gold
appears
at
my
father
court
and
begs
that
he
too
be
allowed
to
try
his
fortune
with
the
dragon
passing
through
the
great
hall
on
my
way
to
my
i
see
him
suddenly
our
eyes
meet
oh
jane
jane
darling
you
ought
to
have
lived
in
those
days
melisande
they
would
have
suited
you
so
well
melisande
will
they
never
come
back
again
jane
well
i
do
quite
see
how
they
can
people
do
dress
in
blue
and
gold
nowadays
i
mean
men
melisande
no
she
sighs
well
i
suppose
i
shall
never
marry
jane
of
course
i
not
romantic
like
you
darling
and
i
do
have
time
to
read
all
the
wonderful
books
you
read
and
though
i
quite
agree
with
everything
you
say
and
of
course
it
must
have
been
thrilling
to
have
lived
in
those
wonderful
old
days
still
here
we
are
and
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
and
what
i
mean
is
here
we
are
melisande
you
are
content
to
put
romance
out
of
your
life
and
to
make
the
ordinary
commonplace
marriage
jane
what
i
mean
is
that
it
would
be
commonplace
if
it
was
the
right
man
some
nice
englishman
i
do
say
beautiful
pleasant
and
good
at
games
dependable
not
very
clever
perhaps
but
making
enough
money
melisande
carelessly
it
sounds
rather
like
bobby
jane
confused
it
is
like
bobby
or
any
one
else
particularly
it
just
anybody
it
was
any
particular
person
i
was
just
describing
the
sort
of
man
without
thinking
of
any
one
in
melisande
all
right
dear
all
right
jane
besides
we
all
know
bobby
devoted
to
melisande
firmly
now
look
here
jane
i
warn
you
solemnly
that
if
you
think
you
are
going
to
leave
me
and
bobby
alone
together
this
evening
voices
are
heard
outside
well
i
warn
you
jane
in
a
whisper
of
course
not
darling
with
perfect
tact
and
as
i
was
saying
melisande
it
was
quite
the
most
ah
here
you
are
at
last
we
wondered
what
had
happened
to
you
enter
bobby
and
knowle
jane
has
already
described
bobby
for
us
knowle
is
a
pleasant
man
with
a
sense
of
humour
which
he
cultivates
for
his
own
amusement
entirely
bobby
were
you
very
miserable
without
us
he
goes
towards
them
jane
laughing
very
melisande
gets
up
as
bobby
comes
and
moves
away
knowle
where
your
mother
sandy
melisande
in
the
i
think
father
knowle
ah

no
doubt

do
want
it
remembered
father
do
you
what
you
said
knowle
not
the
actual
words
all
i
want
my
dear
is
that
you
should
endeavour
to
explain
to
the
cook
the
difference
between
and
a
make
it
clear
to
her
that
there
is
no
need
to
provide
a
with
an
obviously
healthy
chicken
such
as
we
had
but
that
a
properly
made
is
a
necessity
if
the
full
flavour
of
the
bird
is
to
be
obtained
melisande
full
flavour
of
the
bird
is
to
be
obtained
yes
father
knowle
that
right
my
dear

it
home
to
her
a
little
quiet
talk

midsummer
night

out
in
the
garden
looking
for

jane
looking
anxiously
at

melisande
resigned
all

jane
jane
brightly
all

uncle
henry
knowle
very
brightly
it
all

bobby
jane
come
along
they
go
to
the
open
windows
together
knowle
as
they
go
any
message
for
oberon
if
we
meet
him
melisande
gravely
no
thank
you
father
knowle
it
his
turn
to

i
suppose
jane
laughs
as
they
go
out
together
left
alone
melisande
takes
up
a
book
and
goes
to
the
sofa
with
it
while
bobby
walks
about
the
room
unhappily
whistling
to
himself
he
keeps
looking
across
at
her
and
at
last
their
eyes
meet
melisande
putting
down
her
book
well
bobby
bobby
awkwardly
well
sandy
melisande
angrily
do
call
me
that
you
know
how
i
hate
it
bobby
sorry
melisande
but
it
such
a
dashed
mouthful
and
your
father
was
calling
you
sandy
just
now
and
you
did
say
anything
melisande
one
can
not
always
control
one
parents
there
comes
a
time
when
it
is
almost
useless
to
say
things
to
them
bobby
eagerly
i
never
mind
your
saying
things
to
sandy
i
mean
melisande
i
never
shall
mind
really
i
sha
of
course
i
know
i
not
worthy
of
you
and
all
that
but
i
say
melisande
there
hope
melisande
bobby
i
asked
you
not
to
talk
to
me
like
that
again
bobby
coming
to
her
i
know
you
did
but
i
must
i
ca
believe
that
you
melisande
i
told
you
that
if
you
promised
not
to
talk
like
that
again
then
i
would
tell
anybody
anything
about
it
so
that
it
should
be
awkward
for
you
and
i
have
told
anybody
not
even
jane
to
whom
i
tell
all
my
secrets
most
men
when
they
propose
to
a
girl
and
she
refuses
them
have
to
go
right
out
of
the
country
and
shoot
lions
it
the
only
thing
left
for
them
to
do
but
i
did
try
and
make
it
easy
for
bobby
sadly
and
now
you
beginning
all
over
again
bobby
awkwardly
i
though
perhaps
you
might
have
changed
your
mind
lots
of
girls
do
melisande
contemptuously
lots
of
girls
is
that
how
you
think
of
me
bobby
well
your
mother
said
he
breaks
off
hurriedly
melisande
coldly
have
you
been
discussing
me
with
my
mother
bobby
i
say
sandy
do
be
angry
sorry
i
mean
melisande
melisande
do
apologise
go
on
bobby
well
i
did
you
with
your
mother
she
just
happened
to
say
that
girls
never
knew
their
own
minds
and
that
they
always
said
no
the
first
time
and
that
i
need
be
downhearted
because
melisande
that
need
you
mean
you
her
bobby
well
it
sort
of
came
out
melisande
after
i
had
promised
that
i
would
say
anything
you
went
and
her
and
then
i
suppose
you
went
and
told
the
cook
and
said
that
her
brother
young
woman
was
just
the
same
and
then
you
told
the
butcher
and
said
you
stick
to
it
sir
all
women
are
alike
my
missis
said
to
me
the
first
time
and
then
you
went
and
told
the
gardeners
i
suppose
you
had
all
the
gardeners
together
in
the
and
gave
them
a
lecture
about
it
and
when
you
had
told
them
you
said
excuse
me
a
moment
i
must
now
go
and
tell
the
postman
and
then
bobby
i
say
steady
you
know
that
is
fair
melisande
oh
what
a
world
bobby
i
say
you
know
that
is
fair
melisande
picking
up
her
book
father
and
jane
are
outside
bobby
if
you
have
anything
you
wish
to
tell
them
but
i
suppose
they
know
already
she
pretends
to
read
bobby
i
say
you
know
he
does
quite
know
what
to
say
there
is
an
awkward
silence
then
he
says
humbly
i
awfully
sorry
melisande
please
forgive
me
melisande
looking
at
him
gravely
that
nice
of
you
bobby
please
forgive
i
was
fair
bobby
i
swear
i
never
said
anything
to
anybody
else
only
your
mother
and
it
sort
of
came
out
with
she
began
talking
about
you
melisande
know
bobby
but
i
never
told
anybody
else
melisande
it
would
be
necessary
if
you
told
mother
bobby
i
awfully
sorry
but
i
really
do
see
why
you
should
mind
so
much
i
mean
i
know
i
not
anybody
very
much
but
i
ca
help
falling
in
love
with
you
and
well
it
a
sort
of
a
compliment
to
you
is
it
even
if
it
only
me
melisande
of
course
it
is
bobby
and
i
do
thank
you
for
the
compliment
but
mixing
mother
up
in
it
makes
it
all
so
so
unromantic
after
a
pause
sometimes
i
think
i
shall
never
marry
bobby
oh
rot
i
say
you
do
me
do
you
melisande
oh
yes
you
are
a
nice
englishman
i
say
beautiful
bobby
i
should
hope
not
melisande
pleasant
good
at
games
dependable
not
very
clever
perhaps
but
making
enough
money
bobby
well
i
mean
that
not
so
bad
melisande
oh
but
i
want
so
much
more
bobby
what
sort
of
things
melisande
oh
bobby
you
so
so
ordinary
bobby
well
dash
it
all
you
did
want
me
to
be
a
freak
did
you
melisande
so
commonplace
so
unromantic
bobby
i
say
steady
on
i
do
say
i
always
reading
poetry
and
all
that
if
that
what
you
mean
by
romantic
but
commonplace
blessed
if
i
see
how
you
make
out
that
melisande
bobby
i
do
want
to
hurt
your
feelings
bobby
go
on
never
mind
my
feelings
melisande
well
then
look
at
yourself
in
the
glass
bobby
goes
anxiously
to
the
glass
and
then
pulls
at
his
clothes
bobby
looking
back
at
her
well
melisande
well
bobby
i
do
see
what
wrong
melisande
oh
bobby
everything
wrong
the
man
to
whom
i
give
myself
must
be
not
only
my
lover
but
my
true
knight
my
hero
my
prince
he
must
perform
deeds
of
to
win
my
love
oh
how
can
you
perform
deeds
of
in
a
stupid
little
suit
like
that
bobby
looking
at
it
what
the
matter
with
it
it
what
every
other
fellow
wears
melisande
contemptuously
what
every
other
fellow
wears
and
you
think
what
every
other
fellow
thinks
and
talk
what
every
other
fellow
talks
and
eat
what
every
other
i
suppose
did
like
the
this
evening
bobby
guardedly
well
not
as
melisande
nodding
her
head
i
thought
so
i
thought
so
bobby
struck
by
an
idea
i
say
you
did
make
it
did
you
melisande
do
i
look
as
if
i
made
it
bobby
i
thought
perhaps
you
know
i
really
do
know
what
you
want
sandy
sorry
i
mean
melisande
go
on
calling
me
sandy
i
rather
you
did
bobby
well
when
you
marry
this
prince
of
yours
is
going
to
do
the
cooking
i
do
understand
you
sandy
really
i
do
melisande
shaking
her
head
gently
at
him
no
i
sure
you
do
bobby
bobby
still
trying
however
i
suppose
it
because
he
doing
the
cooking
that
he
wo
be
able
to
dress
for
dinner
he
sounds
a
funny
sort
of
chap
i
should
like
to
see
him
melisande
you
would
understand
him
if
you
did
see
him
bobby
jealously
have
you
seen
him
melisande
only
in
my
dreams
bobby
relieved
oh
well
melisande
dreamily
to
herself
perhaps
i
shall
never
see
him
in
this
world
and
then
i
shall
never
marry
but
if
he
ever
comes
for
me
he
will
come
not
like
other
men
and
because
he
is
so
different
from
everybody
else
then
i
shall
know
him
when
he
comes
for
me
he
talk
about
billiards
and
the
money
market
he
wo
wear
a
little
black
suit
with
a
little
black
tie
all
sideways
bobby
hastily
pulls
his
tie
straight
i
do
know
how
he
will
be
dressed
but
i
know
this
that
when
i
see
him
that
when
my
eyes
have
looked
into
his
when
his
eyes
have
looked
into
mine
bobby
i
say
steady
melisande
waking
from
her
dream
yes
she
gives
a
little
laugh
poor
bobby
bobby
appealingly
i
say
sandy
he
goes
up
to
her
knowle
has
seized
this
moment
to
come
back
for
her
handkerchief
she
sees
them
together
and
begins
to
walk
out
on
tiptoe
they
hear
her
and
turn
round
suddenly
knowle
in
a
whisper
do
take
any
notice
of
me
i
only
just
came
for
my
handkerchief
she
continues
to
walk
on
tiptoe
towards
the
opposite
door
melisande
getting
up
we
were
just
wondering
where
you
were
mother
here
your
handkerchief
she
picks
it
up
from
the
sofa
knowle
still
in
the
voice
in
which
you

to
an
invalid
thank

going
to
the
windows
that
right
she
stops
at
the
windows
and
holds
out
her
hands
to
the
night
the
moon
shines
bright
in
such
a
night
as
this
when
the
sweet
wind
did
gently
kiss
the
trees
and
they
did
make
no
noise
in
such
a
night
troilus
methinks
mounted
the
troyan
walls
and
sighed
his
soul
towards
the
grecian
tents
where
cressid
lay
that
night
in
such
a
night
stood
dido
with
a
willow
in
her
hand
upon
the
wild
sea
banks
and
waft
her
love
to
come
again
to
carthage
she
stays
there
a
moment
and
then
says
in
a
thrilling
voice
in
such
a
night
ah
she
goes
to
it
knowle
in
a
different
voice
ah

back

you
that
what
i
said
the
other
day

true
girls

their

minds
bobby
ruefully
i
think
sandy
knows
hers
about
me
anyhow
knowle
coote
you
are
forgetting
what
the
poet
said
shakespeare
or
was
it
the
other
man
faint
heart
never
won
fair
lady
if
knowle
had
had
a
faint
heart
he
would
never
have
won
me
seven
times
i
refused
him
and
seven
times
he
came
again
like
jacob
the
eighth
time
he
drew
out
a
revolver
and
threatened
to
shoot
himself
i
was
shaking
like
an
aspen
leaf
suddenly
i
realised
that
i
loved
him
henry
i
said
i
am
yours
he
took
me
in
his
arms
putting
down
the
revolver
first
of
course
i
have
never
regretted
my
surrender
coote
with
a
sigh
ah
me
we
women
are
strange
creatures
bobby
i
do
believe
sandy
would
mind
if
i
did
shoot
myself
knowle
oh
do
say
that
coote
she
is
very
i
sure
it
would
upset
her
a
good
deal
oh

taking
too
gloomy
a
view
of
the
situation
i
am
sure
of
it
bobby
well
i
sha
shoot
myself
but
i
sha
propose
to

knowle
but
we
do
want
you
coote
both
my
husband
and
i
bobby
i
say
i
much

if
you
do
mind
i
practically
promised
her
that
i
would
say
anything
to
you
this
time
knowle
what
not
say
anything
to

only
mother

funny
about

she
is
indeed
coote
i
do
know
where
she
gets
it
from
neither
henry
nor
i
are
in
the
least
funny
it
was
all
the
result
of
being
christened
in
that
irreligious
way
i
quite
thought
he
said
millicent
and
reading
all
those
books
instead
of
visiting
the
sick
as
i
used
to
do
i
was
quite
a
little
red
riding
hood

henry
sprang
at

out
into

bobby
gloomily
yes
about
five
minutes
ago
jane
timidly
i
so
sorry
bobby
bobby
thanks
it
awfully
decent
of
you
after
a
pause
do
talk
about
it
jane
of
course
i
wo
if
it
hurts
you
bobby
but
i
felt
i
to
say
something
i
felt
so
sorry
you
did
mind
did
you
bobby
it
awfully
decent
of
you
to
mind
jane
gently
i
mind
very
much
when
my
friends
are
unhappy
bobby
thanks
awfully
he
stands
up
buttons
his
coat
and
looks
at
himself
i
say
do
see
anything
wrong
with
it
jane
wrong
with
what
bobby
my
clothes
he
revolves
slowly
jane
of
course
not
they
fit
beautifully
bobby
sandy
so
funny
about
things
i
do
know
what
she
means
half
the
time
jane
of
course
i
very
fond
of
melisande
but
i
do
see
what
you
mean
she
so
searching
for
the
right
word
so
bobby
eagerly
yes
that
just
it
it
takes
a
bit
of
living
up
to
i
say
have
a
cigarette
wo
you
jane
no
thank
you
of
course
i
very
fond
of
melisande
but
i
do
feel
sometimes
that
i
do
altogether
envy
the
man
who
marries
her
bobby
i
say
do
you
really
feel
that
jane
yes
she
too
getting
the
right
word
at
last
too
bobby
you
about
right
you
know
i
mean
she
talks
about
doing
deeds
of
well
i
mean
that
all
very
well
but
when
one
marries
and
settles
down
you
know
what
i
mean
jane
exactly
that
just
how
i
feel
about
it
as
i
said
to
melisande
only
this
evening
this
is
the
twentieth
century
well
i
happen
to
like
the
twentieth
century
that
all
bobby
i
see
what
you
mean
jane
it
may
be
very
unromantic
of
me
but
i
like
men
to
be
keen
on
games
and
to
wear
the
clothes
that
everybody
else
wears
as
long
as
they
fit
well
of
course
and
to
talk
about
the
ordinary
things
that
everybody
talks
about
of
course
melisande
would
say
that
that
was
very
stupid
and
unromantic
of
me
bobby
i
do
think
it
is
at
all
jane
how
awfully
nice
of
you
to
say
that
bobby
you
do
understand
so
wonderfully
bobby
with
a
laugh
i
say
that
rather
funny
i
was
just
thinking
the
same
about
you
jane
i
say
were
you
really
i
so
glad
i
like
to
feel
that
we
are
really
friends
and
that
we
understand
each
other
i
do
know
whether
i
different
from
other
girls
but
i
do
make
friends
very
easily
bobby
do
you
mean
men
or
women
friends
jane
both
in
fact
but
for
melisande
and
you
i
can
hardly
think
of
any
not
what
you
call
real
friends
bobby
melisande
is
a
great
friend
is
she
you
tell
each
other
all
your
secrets
and
that
sort
of
thing
do
you
jane
yes
we
great
friends
but
there
are
some
things
that
i
could
never
tell
even
her
impressively
i
could
never
show
her
my
inmost
heart
bobby
i
do
believe
about
your
not
having
any
men
friends
i
bet
there
are
hundreds
of
them
as
keen
on
you
as
anything
jane
i
wonder
it
would
be
rather
nice
to
think
there
were
that
sounds
horrid
does
it
but
a
girl
ca
help
wanting
to
be
liked
bobby
of
course
she
ca
nobody
can
i
do
think
it
a
bit
horrid
jane
how
nice
of
you
she
gets
up
well
i
must
be
going
i
suppose
bobby
what
the
hurry
jane
aunt
mary
she
said
five
minutes
bobby
and
how
long
will
you
be
with
her
you
come
down
again
wo
you
jane
no
i
do
think
so
i
rather
tired
this
evening
holding
out
her
hand
bobby
bobby
taking
it
oh
but
look
here
i
come
and
light
your
candle
for
you
jane
how
nice
of
you
she
manages
to
get
her
hand
back
and
they
walk
to
the
door
together
bobby
i
suppose
i
may
as
well
go
to
bed
myself
jane
at
the
door
well
if
you
are
we
better
put
the
lights
out
bobby
righto
he
puts
them
out
i
say
what
a
night
the
moonlight
streams
through
the
windows
on
them
you
hardly
want
a
candle
they
go
out
together
the
hall
is
empty
suddenly
the
front
door
bell
is
heard
to
ring
after
a
little
interval
alice
comes
in
turns
on
the
light
and
looks
round
the
hall
she
is
walking
across
the
hall
to
the
when
knowle
comes
in
from
behind
her
and
she
turns
round
knowle
were
you
looking
for
me
alice
alice
yes

a
gentleman
at
the
front
door
sir
knowle
rather
late
for
a
call
is
it
alice

motor
car
sir
and
it
broken
down
and
he
wondered
if

him
a
little
petrol
he
told
me
to
say
how
very
sorry
he
was
to
trouble
you
knowle
but
he
not
troubling
me
at
all
particularly
if
peters
is
about
i
daresay
you
could
find
peters
alice
and
if
it
not
troubling
peters
too
much
perhaps
he
would
see
to
it
and
ask
the
gentleman
to
come
in
we
ca
keep
him
standing
on
the
alice
yes
sir
i
did
ask
him
before
sir
knowle
well
ask
him
this
time
in
the
voice
of
one
who
is
about
to
bring
in
the
whiskey
alice
yes
sir
knowle
and
then
bring
in
the
whiskey
alice

a
moment
later

he
really
wo
come
in
and
he
very
sorry
indeed
to
trouble
you
about
the
petrol
knowle
ah
i
afraid
we
were
too
allusive
for
him
alice
hopefully
yes
sir
knowle
well
we
wo
be
quite
so
subtle
this
time
present
knowle
compliments
and
say
that
i
shall
be

honoured
if

will
drink
a
glass
of

and
then
bring

she
goes
out
in
a
little
while

the
stranger

i

wonderful
young

you
must
wonder
what
on
earth
i
doing
knowle
no
no
i
wondered
what
on
earth
been
doing
gervase
you
see
i
going
to
a
fancy
dress
dance
at
collingham
knowle
you
relieve
my
mind
considerably
gervase
that
why
i
did
want
to
come
in
or
take
my
cloak
off
knowle
inspecting
him
it
becomes
you
extraordinarily
well
if
i
may
say
so
gervase
oh
thanks
very
much
but
one
feels
rather
absurd
in
it
when
other
people
are
in
ordinary
clothes
knowle
on
the
contrary
you
make
other
people
feel
absurd
i
do
know
that
that
particular
style
would
have
suited
me
but
looking
at
himself
i
am
sure
that
i
could
have
found
something
more
expressive
of
my
emotions
than
this
gervase
you
quite
right
dress
does
make
a
difference
davy
knowle
it
does
indeed
gervase
i
feel
it
almost
wicked
of
me
to
be
drinking
a
whiskey
and
soda
knowle
very
wicked
taking
out
his
case
have
a
cigarette
too
gervase
may
i
have
one
of
my
own
knowle
do
gervase
feeling
for
it
if
i
can
find
it
they
were
very
careless
about
pockets
in
the
old
days
i
had
a
special
one
put
in
somewhere
only
it
rather
difficult
to
get
at
ah
here
it
is
he
takes
a
cigarette
from
his
case
and
after
trying
to
put
the
case
back
in
his
pocket
again
places
it
on
the
table
knowle
match
gervase
thanks

up
his
whiskey
well

my
most
grateful
thanks

raising
his
glass
may
you
slay
all
your
dragons
gervase
thank
you

knowle
well
now
about
collingham
i
do
know
if
you
saw
a
map
outside
in
the
hall
gervase
i
saw
it
but
i
am
afraid
i
did
look
at
it
i
was
too
much
interested
in
your
prints
knowle
eagerly
you
do
say
that
you
are
interested
in
prints
gervase
very
much
as
an
entire
amateur
knowle
most
of
the
young
men
who
come
here
think
that
the
art
began
and
ended
with
kirchner
if
you
are
really
interested
i
have
something
in
the
library
but
of
course
i
must
take
up
your
time
now
if
you
could
bear
to
come
over
another
day
after
all
we
are
neighbours
gervase
it
awfully
nice
of
you
i
should
love
it
knowle
hedgling

you
seem
to
have
lost
your
way
so
completely
gervase
oh
by
jove
now
i
know
where
i
am
it
so
different
in
the
moonlight
i
lunching
this
way
might
i
come
on
afterwards
and
then
i
can
return
your
petrol
thank
you
for
your
hospitality
and
expose
my
complete
ignorance
of
old
prints
all
in
one
afternoon
knowle
well
but
you
must
come
anyhow
come
to
tea
gervase
that
will
be
ripping
getting
up
well
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
getting
on

picks
up
his
cloak

we
might
just
have
a
look
at
that
map
on
the
way
gervase
oh
yes
do
let
they
go
to
the
door
together
and
stand
for
a
moment
looking
at
the
casement
windows
knowle
it
really
is
a
wonderful
night
he
switches
off
the
lights
and
the
moon
streams
through
the
windows
just
look
gervase
with
a
deep
sigh
wonderful
they
go
out
together
the
hall
is
empty
for
a
moment
then
gervase
reappears
he
has
forgotten
his
he
finds
it
and
on
his
way
out
again
stops
for
a
moment
in
the
moonlight
looking
through
the
casement
windows
melisande
comes
in
by
the
french
windows
he
hears
her
and
at
the
same
moment
she
sees
him
she
gives
a
little
wondering
cry
it
is
he
the
knight
of
her
dreams
they
stand
gazing
at
each
other
silently
he
makes
obeisance
to
her
silently
she
acknowledges
it
then
he
is
gone
act
ii
it
is
seven
on
a
beautiful
midsummer
morning
the
scene
is
a
glade
in
a
wood
a
little
way
above
the
village
of
hedgling
gervase
mallory
still
in
his
fancy
dress
but
with
his
cloak
on
comes
in
he
looks
round
him
and
says
by
jove
how
jolly
he
takes
off
his
cloak
throws
it
down
stretches
himself
turns
round
and
seeing
the
view
behind
him
goes
to
look
at
it
while
he
is
looking
he
hears
an
unmelodious
whistling
he
turns
round
with
a
start
the
whistling
goes
on
he
says
good
lord
and
tries
to
get
to
his
cloak
it
is
too
late
ern
a
very
small
boy
comes
through
the
trees
into
the
glade
gervase
gives
a
sigh
of
resignation
and
stands
there
ern
stops
in
the
middle
of
his
tune
and
gazes
at
him
ern
oo

circles
slowly
round

ern
ern
gervase
mallory
we

never

any
farther
once
an
introduction
is
over
hearne
we
are
ern
ern
gervase
yes
i
know
i
was
very
glad
to
hear
it
but
now
oh
i
see
what
you
mean
ern
short
for
ernest
ern
nodding
they
calls
me
ern
gervase
that
very
friendly
of
them
being
more
of
a
stranger
i
shall
call
you
ernest
well
ernest
getting
up
just
excuse
me
a
moment
will
you
very
penetrating
bark
this
tree
has
it
must
be
a
pomeranian
he
folds
his
cloak
upon
it
and
sits
down
again
better
now
we
can
talk
comfortably
together
i
do
know
if
anything
you
particularly
want
to
discuss
nothing
well
then
i
will
suggest
the
subject
of
breakfast
ern
grinning
my
breakfast
gervase
you
yours
you
selfish
brute
of
course
wondering
why
i
have
had
mine
ern
bacon
fat
he
makes
reminiscent
noises
gervase
do
keep
on
going
through
all
the
courses
well
what
happened
was
this
my
car
broke
down
i
suppose
you
never
had
a
motor
car
of
your
own
ern
do
like
moty
cars
gervase
well
really
after
last
night
i
inclined
to
agree
with
you
well
no
i
ought
to
say
that
because
if
i
had
broken
down
i
should
never
have
seen
her
ernest
i
do
know
if
married
or
anything
of
that
sort
but
i
think
even
your
rough
stern
heart
would
have
been
moved
by
that
vision
of
loveliness
which
i
saw
last
night
he
is
silent
for
a
little
thinking
of
her
well
then
i
lost
my
way
there
i
was
ten
miles
from
anywhere
in
the
middle
of
what
was
supposed
to
be
a
short
cut
late
at
night
midsummer
night
what
would
have
done
ernest
ern
gone
gervase
do
be
silly
how
could
i
go
home
when
i
did
know
where
home
was
and
it
was
a
hundred
miles
away
and
i
just
seen
the
princess
no
i
did
what
your
father
or
your
uncle
george
or
any
wise
man
would
have
done
i
sat
in
the
car
and
thought
of
her
ern
oo
gervase
you
are
surprised
ah
but
if
you
seen
her
have
you
ever
been
alone
in
the
moonlight
on
midsummer
night
i
do
mean
just
for
a
minute
or
two
but
all
through
the
night
until
the
dawn
came
you
are
really
alone
you
know
all
round
you
there
are
little
whisperings
going
on
little
breathings
little
rustlings
somebody
is
out
hunting
somebody
stirs
in
his
sleep
as
he
dreams
again
the
hunt
of
yesterday
somebody
up
in
the
pipes
suddenly
to
the
dawn
and
then
finding
that
the
dawn
has
not
come
puts
his
silly
little
head
back
under
his
wing
and
goes
to
sleep
again
and
the
fairies
are
out
do
you
believe
in
fairies
ernest
you
would
have
believed
in
them
last
night
i
heard
them
whispering
ern
oo
gervase
coming
out
of
his
thoughts
with
a
laugh
well
of
course
i
ca
expect
you
to
believe
me
but
do
go
about
thinking
that
there
nothing
in
the
world
but
bacon
fat
and
well
then
i
suppose
i
went
to
sleep
for
i
woke
up
suddenly
and
it
was
morning
the
most
wonderful
sparkling
magical
morning
but
of
course
were
just
settling
down
to
business
then
ern
oo
he
makes
more
reminiscent
noises
gervase
yes
that
just
what
i
said
i
said
to
myself
breakfast
ern
my
breakfast
gervase
yes
but
i
i
said
to
myself
surely
my
old
friend
ernest
whom
i
used
to
shoot
bison
with
in
the
himalayas
has
got
an
estate
somewhere
in
these
parts
i
will
go
and
share
his
simple
meal
with
him
so
i
got
out
of
the
car
and
i
did
what
you
did
do
young
man
i
had
a
bathe
in
the
river
and
then
a
dry
on
a
one
of
my
sister
unfortunately
and
then
i
came
out
to
look
for
breakfast
and
suddenly
whom
should
i
meet
but
my
old
friend
ernest
the
same
hearty
fellow
the
same
inveterate
talker
as
when
we
shot
together
in
the
swamps
of
malay
shaking
his
hand
ernest
old
boy
pleased
to
meet
you
what
about
it
ern
my
gervase
he
gets
up
now
then
to
business
do
you
mind
looking
the
other
way
while
i
try
to
find
my
purse
feeling
for
it
every
morning
when
you
get
up
you
should
say
thank
god
i
getting
a
big
boy
now
and
i
got
pockets
in
my
trousers
and
you
should
feel
very
sorry
for
the
poor
people
who
lived
in
fairy
books
and
had
no
trousers
to
put
pockets
in
ah
here
we
are
now
then
ernest
attend
very
carefully
where

a
mile

good
now
then
i
want
you
to
take

thought
that

you
and
i
want
you
to
ask
your
mother
if
you
can
bring
me
some
breakfast
up
here
now
listen
very
carefully
because
we
are

a
bottle
of
milk
and
anything

important
because

old
friend
mallory
whom
you

roadside
and
if

as

goes
off
my

slowly
after
him
and
stands
looking
at

as
he
goes
down
the
hill

walks
towards

i
only
just
mentioned
it
in
passing
as

brings
out
a
paper

the
fact
of

my
simple

pocket
and

reveals
part
of

at

his

but
you

by
chance
a
upon
the
road
gervase
do
you
mean
professionally
susan
yes
there
is
a
young
fellow
a
contortionist
and
known
locally
in
these
parts
as
humphrey
the
human
hiatus
who
travels
from
village
to
village
just
for
a
moment
i
wondered
he
glances
at
gervase
legs
which
are
uncovered
gervase
hastily
wraps
his
coat
round
them
gervase
i
am
not
humphrey
no
gervase
the
cheese
swallower
er
my
costume
susan
please
say
nothing
more
it
was
of
me
to
have
inquired
let
a
man
wear
what
he
likes
it
is
a
free
world
gervase
well
the
fact
is
i
have
been
having
a
bathe
susan
with
a
bow
i
congratulate
you
on
your
bathing
costume
gervase
not
at
all
susan
you
live
near
here
then
gervase
little
malling
i
came
over
in
a
car
susan
little
malling
that
about
twenty
miles
away
gervase
oh
much
more
than
that
surely
susan
no
there
hedgling
down
there
gervase
surprised
hedgling
heavens
how
i
must
have
lost
my
way
then
i
have
been
within
a
mile
of
her
all
night
and
i
never
knew
susan
you
are
married
mallory
gervase
no
not
yet
susan
get
married
gervase
what
susan
take
my
advice
and
get
married
gervase
you
recommend
it
susan
i
do
there
is
no
companion
like
a
wife
if
you
marry
the
right
woman
gervase
oh
susan
i
have
been
married
thirty
years
thirty
years
of
happiness
gervase
but
in
your
profession
you
must
go
away
from
your
wife
a
good
deal
susan
smiling
but
then
i
come
back
to
her
a
good
deal
gervase
thoughtfully
yes
that
must
be
rather
jolly
susan
why
do
you
think
i
welcomed
your
company
so
much
when
i
came
upon
you
here
this
morning
gervase
modestly
oh
well
susan
it
was
something
to
tell
my
wife
when
i
got
back
to
her
when
you
are
married
every
adventure
becomes
two
adventures
you
have
your
adventure
and
then
you
go
back
to
your
wife
and
have
your
adventure
again
perhaps
it
is
a
better
adventure
that
second
time
you
can
say
the
things
which
you
did
quite
say
the
first
time
and
do
the
things
which
you
did
quite
do
when
my
week
travels
are
ever
and
i
go
back
to
my
wife
i
shall
have
a
whole
week
happenings
to
tell
her
they
wo
lose
in
the
telling
mallory
our
little
breakfast
here
this
morning
she
will
love
to
hear
about
that
i
can
see
her
happy
excited
face
as
i
tell
her
all
that
i
said
to
you
and
if
i
can
remember
it
all
that
you
said
to
me
gervase
eagerly
i
say
how
jolly
thoughtfully
you
wo
forget
what
i
said
about
the
great
percy
i
thought
that
was
rather
good
susan
i
hope
it
was
too
good
mallory
if
it
was
i
shall
find
myself
telling
it
to
her
as
one
of
my
own
remarks
that
why
i
say
get
married
then
you
can
make
things
fair
for
yourself
you
can
tell
her
all
the
good
things
of
mine
which
said
gervase
but
there
must
be
more
in
marriage
than
that
susan
there
are
a
million
things
in
marriage
but
companionship
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
do
you
know
what
companionship
means
gervase
how
do
you
mean
literally
susan
the
derivation
of
it
in
the
dictionary
it
means
the
art
of
having
meals
with
a
person
cynics
talk
of
the
impossibility
of
sitting
opposite
the
same
woman
every
day
at
breakfast
impossible
to
perhaps
poor
creatures
but
not
impossible
to
two
people
who
have
found
what
love
is
gervase
it
does
sound
very
romantic
susan
solemnly
it
is
the
most
romantic
thing
in
the
whole
world
some
more
cheese
gervase
taking
it
thank
you
thoughtfully
do
you
believe
in
love
at
first
sight
master
susan
susan
why
not
if
it
the
woman
you
love
at
first
sight
not
only
the
face
gervase
i
see
after
a
pause
it
rather
hard
to
tell
you
know
i
suppose
the
proper
thing
to
do
is
to
ask
her
to
have
breakfast
with
you
and
see
how
you
get
on
susan
well
you
might
do
worse
gervase
laughing
and
propose
to
her
after
breakfast
susan
if
you
will
it
is
better
than
proposing
to
her
at
a
ball
as
some
young
people
do
carried
away
suddenly
by
a
snatched
kiss
in
the
moonlight
gervase
shaking
his
head
nothing
like
that
happened
last
night
susan
what
does
the
great
alfred
say
of
the
kiss
gervase
i
never
read
the
susan
tennyson
mallory
tennyson
gervase
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
susan
the
kiss
says
the
great
alfred
the
woven
arms
seem
but
to
be
weak
symbols
of
the
settled
bliss
the
comfort
i
have
found
in
thee
the
same
idea
mallory
companionship
or
the
art
of
having
breakfast
with
a
person
getting
up
well
i
must
be
moving
on
have
been
companions
for
a
short
time
i
thank
you
for
it
i
wish
you
well
gervase
getting
up
i
say
i
been
awfully
glad
to
meet
you
and
i
shall
never
forget
the
breakfast
you
gave
me
susan
it
is
friendly
of
you
to
say
so
gervase
hesitatingly
you
wo
mind
my
having
another
one
when
ernest
comes
back
i
mean
if
ernest
comes
back
you
wo
think
slighting
yours
in
any
way
but
after
an
outdoor
bathe
you
know
one
does
susan
please
i
am
happy
to
think
you
have
such
an
appetite
gervase
holding
out
his
hand
well
susan
susan
looks
at
his
hand
doubtfully
and
gervase
says
with
a
laugh
oh
come
on
susan
shaking
it
mallory
gervase
and
i
sha
forget
what
you
said
susan
smiling
i
expect
you
will
mallory
he
goes
off
gervase
calling
after
him
because
it
was
the
moonlight
it
was
really
it
was
just
to
himself
it
was
just
i
suppose
the
great
whatsisname
would
say
it
was
just
she
but
then
that
is
what
i
mean
gervase
watches
him
going
down
the
hill
then
he
turns
to
the
other
side
says
hallo
suddenly
in
great
astonishment
and
withdraws
a
few
steps
gervase
it
ca
be
he
goes
cautiously
forward
and
looks
again
it
is
he
comes
back
and
walks
gently
off
through
the
trees
melisande
comes
in
she
has
no
hat
her
hair
is
in
two
plaits
to
her
waist
she
is
wearing
a
dress
which
might
belong
to
any
century
she
stands
in
the
middle
of
the
glade
looks
round
it
holds
out
her
hands
to
it
for
a
moment
and
then
clasps
them
with
a
sigh
of
happiness
gervase
his
cloak
thrown
away
comes
in
behind
her
for
a
moment
he
is
by
the
trees
gervase
very
softly
princess
she
hears
but
thinks
she
is
still
dreaming
she
smiles
a
little
gervase
a
little
more
loudly
princess
she
listens
and
nods
to
herself
gervase
steps
out
into
the
open
gervase
princess
she
turns
round
melisande
looking
at
him
wonderingly
you
gervase
at
your
service
princess
melisande
it
was
you
who
came
last
night
gervase
i
was
at
your
father
court
last
night
i
saw
you
you
looked
at
me
melisande
i
thought
it
was
only
a
dream
when
i
looked
at
you
i
thought
it
was
a
dream
when
you
called
me
just
now
is
it
still
a
dream
gervase
if
it
is
a
dream
let
us
go
on
dreaming
melisande
where
do
you
come
from
fairyland
gervase
this
is
fairyland
we
are
in
the
enchanted
forest
melisande
with
a
sigh
of
happiness
ah
gervase
you
have
been
looking
for
it
melisande
for
so
long
she
is
silent
for
a
little
and
then
says
with
a
smile
may
one
sit
down
in
an
enchanted
forest
gervase
your
throne
awaits
you
he
spreads
his
cloak
over
the
log
melisande
thank
you
wo
you
sit
too
gervase
shaking
his
head
i
have
finished
looking
at
you
yet
you
are
very
lovely
princess
melisande
am
i
gervase
have
they
told
you
melisande
perhaps
i
wondered
sometimes
gervase
very
lovely
have
you
a
name
which
goes
with
it
melisande
my
name
is
melisande
gervase
his
whole
heart
in
it
melisande
melisande
content
at
last
ah
gervase
solemnly
now
the
princess
melisande
was
very
beautiful
he
lies
down
on
the
grass
near
her
looks
up
at
her
and
is
silent
for
a
little
melisande
smiling
shyly
may
we
talk
about
now
gervase
it
is
for
the
princess
to
say
what
we
shall
talk
about
if
your
royal
highness
commands
then
i
will
even
talk
about
myself
melisande
you
see
i
do
know
your
name
yet
gervase
i
am
called
gervase
melisande
gervase
it
is
a
pretty
name
gervase
i
have
been
keeping
it
for
this
morning
melisande
it
will
be
prince
gervase
will
it
not
if
this
is
fairyland
gervase
alas
no
for
i
am
only
a
humble
woodcutter
son
one
of
seven
melisande
of
seven
i
thought
that
humble
woodcutters
always
had
three
sons
and
that
it
was
the
youngest
who
went
into
the
world
to
seek
his
fortune
gervase
three
that
right
i
said
one
of
several
now
that
i
count
them
up
three
counting
on
his
fingers
er
bowshanks
er
and
myself
three
i
am
the
youngest
melisande
and
the
fairies
came
to
your
christening
gervase
now
for
the
first
time
i
think
that
they
did
melisande
nodding
they
always
come
to
the
christening
of
the
third
and
youngest
son
and
they
make
him
the
tallest
and
the
bravest
and
the
most
handsome
gervase
modestly
oh
well
melisande
you
the
tallest
and
the
bravest
and
the
most
handsome
are
you
gervase
with
a
modest
smile
well
of
course
is
hardly
a
starter
and
then
bowshanks
he
indicates
the
curve
of
his
legs
i
mean
there
not
much
competition
melisande
i
have
no
sisters
gervase
the
princess
never
has
sisters
she
has
suitors
melisande
with
a
sigh
yes
she
has
suitors
gervase
taking
out
his
dagger
tell
me
their
names
that
i
may
remove
them
for
you
melisande
there
is
one
dressed
in
black
and
white
who
seeks
to
win
my
hand
gervase
feeling
the
point
he
bites
the
dust
melisande
gervase
unless
it
rains
in
the
night
perhaps
it
would
be
safer
if
we
arranged
for
him
to
bite
it
this
afternoon
melisande
how
brave
you
are
gervase
say
no
more
it
will
be
a
pleasure
melisande
ah
but
i
can
not
ask
you
to
make
this
sacrifice
for
me
gervase
the
sacrifice
will
be
his
melisande
but
are
you
so
certain
that
will
kill
him
suppose
he
were
to
kill
gervase
getting
up
madam
when
the
third
son
of
a
humble
woodcutter
engages
in
mortal
combat
with
one
upon
whom
the
beautiful
princess
has
frowned
there
can
be
but
one
end
to
the
struggle
to
doubt
this
would
be
to
let
romance
go
melisande
you
are
right
i
should
never
have
doubted
gervase
at
the
same
time
it
would
perhaps
be
as
well
to
ask
the
help
of
my
uncle
otto
melisande
but
is
it
fair
to
seek
the
assistance
of
an
uncle
in
order
to
kill
one
small
black
and
white
suitor
gervase
ah
but
he
is
a
wizard
one
is
always
allowed
to
ask
the
help
of
a
wizard
my
idea
was
that
he
should
cast
a
spell
upon
the
presumptuous
youth
who
seeks
to
woo
you
so
that
to
those
who
gazed
upon
him
he
should
have
the
outward
semblance
of
a
rabbit
he
would
then
realise
the
hopelessness
of
his
suit
and
go
away
melisande
with
dignity
i
should
certainly
never
marry
a
small
black
and
white
rabbit
gervase
no
you
could
could
you
melisande
gravely
no
then
their
eyes
meet
there
is
a
twinkle
in
his
hers
respond
and
suddenly
they
are
laughing
together
what
nonsense
you
talk
gervase
well
it
such
an
absurdly
fine
morning
is
it
there
a
sort
of
sparkle
in
the
air
i
really
trying
to
be
quite
sensible
melisande
making
room
for
him
at
her
feet
go
on
talking
nonsense
he
sits
down
on
the
ground
and
leans
against
the
log
at
her
side
tell
me
about
yourself
you
have
told
me
nothing
yet
but
that
she
smiles
at
him
your
father
is
a
woodcutter
gervase
yes
he
er
cuts
wood
melisande
and
you
resolved
to
go
out
into
the
world
and
seek
your
fortune
gervase
yes
you
see
if
you
are
a
third
son
of
a
humble
woodcutter
nobody
thinks
very
much
of
you
at
home
and
they
never
take
you
out
with
them
and
when
you
are
cutting
wood
they
always
put
you
where
the
sawdust
gets
into
your
mouth
because
you
see
they
have
never
read
history
and
so
they
do
know
that
the
third
and
youngest
son
is
always
the
nicest
of
the
family
melisande
and
the
tallest
and
the
bravest
and
the
most
handsome
gervase
all
the
other
things
you
mention
melisande
so
you
ran
away
gervase
so
i
ran
away
to
seek
my
fortune
melisande
but
your
uncle
the
wizard
or
your
godmother
or
somebody
gave
you
a
magic
ring
to
take
with
you
on
your
travels
nodding
they
always
do
you
know
gervase
showing
the
ring
on
his
finger
yes
my
fairy
godmother
gave
me
a
magic
ring
here
it
is
melisande
looking
at
it
what
does
it
do
gervase
you
turn
it
round
once
and
think
very
hard
of
anybody
you
want
and
suddenly
the
person
you
are
thinking
of
appears
before
you
melisande
how
wonderful
have
you
tried
it
yet
gervase
once
that
why
you
are
here
melisande
oh
softly
have
you
been
thinking
of
me
gervase
all
night
melisande
i
dreamed
of
you
all
night
gervase
happily
did
you
melisande
how
dear
of
you
to
dream
of
me
anxiously
was
i
was
i
all
right
melisande
oh
yes
gervase
pleased
ah
he
spreads
himself
a
little
and
removes
a
speck
of
dust
from
his
sleeve
melisande
thinking
of
it
still
you
were
so
brave
gervase
yes
i
expect
i
pretty
brave
in
other
people
dreams
so
cowardly
in
my
own
did
i
kill
anybody
melisande
you
were
engaged
in
a
terrible
fight
with
a
dragon
when
i
woke
up
gervase
leaving
me
and
the
dragon
still
asleep
i
mean
still
fighting
oh
melisande
how
could
you
leave
us
until
you
knew
who
had
won
melisande
i
tried
so
hard
to
get
back
to
you
gervase
i
expect
i
was
winning
you
know
i
wish
you
could
have
got
back
for
the
finish
melisande
let
me
come
into
your
dreams
again
melisande
you
never
asked
me
last
night
you
just
came
gervase
thank
you
for
letting
me
come
melisande
and
then
when
i
woke
up
early
this
morning
the
world
was
so
young
so
beautiful
so
fresh
that
i
had
to
be
with
it
it
called
to
me
so
clearly
to
come
out
and
find
its
secret
so
i
came
up
here
to
this
enchanted
place
and
all
the
way
it
whispered
to
me
wonderful
things
gervase
what
did
it
whisper
melisande
melisande
the
secret
of
happiness
gervase
ah
what
is
it
melisande
she
smiles
and
shakes
her
head
i
met
a
magician
in
the
woods
this
morning
melisande
did
he
speak
to
you
gervase
told
the
secret
of
happiness
melisande
what
did
he
tell
you
gervase
he
said
it
was
marriage
melisande
ah
but
he
did
mean
by
marriage
what
so
many
people
mean
gervase
he
seemed
a
very
potent
magician
melisande
marriage
to
many
people
means
just
food
housekeeping
did
mean
that
gervase
a
very
wise
and
reverend
magician
melisande
love
is
romance
is
there
anything
romantic
in
breakfast
or
lunch
gervase
well
not
so
much
in
lunch
of
course
but
melisande
how
well
you
understand
why
do
the
others
not
understand
gervase
smiling
at
her
perhaps
because
they
have
not
seen
melisande
melisande
oh
no
no
that
is
it
all
the
others
gervase
do
you
mean
your
suitors
melisande
yes
they
are
so
unromantic
so
material
the
clothes
they
wear
the
things
they
talk
about
but
you
are
so
different
why
is
it
gervase
i
do
know
perhaps
because
i
am
the
third
son
of
a
woodcutter
perhaps
because
they
do
know
that
you
are
the
princess
perhaps
because
they
have
never
been
in
the
enchanted
forest
melisande
what
would
the
forest
tell
them
gervase
all
the
birds
in
the
forest
are
singing
melisande
the
little
brook
runs
through
the
forest
murmuring
melisande
the
tall
trees
bend
their
heads
and
whisper
to
each
other
melisande
all
the
flowers
have
put
on
their
gay
dresses
for
her
oh
melisande
melisande
awed
is
it
true
they
are
silent
for
a
little
happy
to
be
together
he
looks
back
at
her
and
gives
a
sudden
little
laugh
what
is
it
gervase
just
you
and
i
together
on
the
top
of
the
world
like
this
melisande
yes
that
what
i
feel
too
after
a
pause
go
on
pretending
gervase
pretending
melisande
that
the
world
is
very
young
gervase
are
very
young
melisande
melisande
timidly
it
is
only
a
dream
is
it
gervase
who
knows
what
a
dream
is
perhaps
we
fell
asleep
in
fairyland
a
thousand
years
ago
and
all
that
we
thought
real
was
a
dream
until
now
at
last
we
are
awake
again
melisande
how
wonderful
that
would
be
gervase
perhaps
we
are
dreaming
now
but
is
it
your
dream
or
my
dream
melisande
melisande
after
thinking
it
out
i
think
i
would
rather
it
were
your
dream
gervase
for
then
i
should
be
in
it
and
that
would
mean
that
you
had
been
thinking
of
me
gervase
then
it
shall
be
dream
melisande
melisande
let
it
be
a
long
one
my
dear
gervase
for
ever
and
for
ever
melisande
dreamily
oh
i
know
that
it
is
only
a
dream
and
that
presently
we
shall
wake
up
or
else
that
you
will
go
away
and
i
will
go
away
too
and
we
shall
never
meet
again
for
in
the
real
world
what
could
i
be
to
you
or
you
to
me
so
go
on
pretending
he
stands
up
and
faces
her
gervase
melisande
if
this
were
fairyland
or
if
we
were
knights
and
ladies
in
some
old
romance
would
you
trust
yourself
to
me
melisande
so
very
proudly
gervase
you
would
let
me
come
to
your
father
court
and
claim
you
over
all
your
other
suitors
and
fight
for
you
and
take
you
away
with
me
melisande
if
this
were
fairyland
yes
gervase
you
would
trust
me
melisande
i
would
trust
my
lord
gervase
smiling
at
her
then
i
will
come
for
the
princess
this
afternoon
with
sudden
feeling
ah
how
can
i
keep
away
now
that
i
have
seen
the
princess
melisande
shyly
happily
when
you
saw
me
last
night
did
you
know
that
you
would
see
me
again
gervase
i
have
been
waiting
for
you
here
melisande
how
did
you
know
that
i
would
come
gervase
on
such
a
morning
in
such
a
place
how
could
the
loved
one
not
be
here
melisande
looking
away
the
loved
one
gervase
i
saw
you
last
night
melisande

will
come
away
with
me
out
into
the
world
with
me
over
the
hills
and
far
away
with
me
melisande
softly
over
the
hills
and
far
away

to
her

talking
about

a
girl
has
her
pride
bobby
bobby
so

a
man
i
awfully
proud
of
being
in
love
with
jane
that
is
what
i
mean
bobby
what
do
you
mean
jane
awkwardly
well
well
well
what
it
comes
to
is
that
you
get
refused
by
sandy
and
then
you
immediately
come
to
me
and
expect
me
to
jump
at
you
bobby
suppose
i
had
waited
a
year
and
then
come
to
you
would
that
have
been
better
jane
of
course
it
would
bobby
well
really
i
ca
follow
you
darling
jane
indignantly
you
must
call
me
darling
bobby
must
call
you
what
jane
awkwardly
darling
bobby
did
i
call
you
darling
jane
shortly
yes
bobby
to
himself
darling
no
i
suppose
i
must
but
it
suits
you
so
awfully
well
darling
she
stamps
her
foot
i
sorry
darl
i
mean
jane
but
really
i
ca
follow
you

frightfully
fascinating
that
after
hours
of
it
i
simply
have
to
tell
you
how
much
i
love
you
then
your
pride
is
hurt
but
if
you
had
been
so
frightfully
unattractive
that
it
took
me
a
whole

decent

he
turns
and
sees
melisande
coming
through
the
garden
hallo
here
sandy
he
hurries
off
in
the
opposite
direction
melisande
oh
jane
jane
she
sinks
into
a
chair
jane
what
dear
melisande
everything
jane
yes
but
that
so
vague
darling
do
you
mean
that
melisande
dreamily
i
have
seen
him
i
have
talked
to
him
he
has
kissed
me
jane
amazed
you
do
you
mean
that
he
has
kissed
you
melisande
i
have
looked
into
his
eyes
and
he
has
looked
into
mine
jane
yes
but
who
melisande
the
true
knight
the
prince
for
whom
i
have
been
waiting
so
long
jane
but
is
he
melisande
they
call
him
gervase
jane
gervase
melisande
scornfully
did
elaine
say
lancelot
who
when
they
told
her
his
name
was
lancelot
jane
yes
dear
but
this
is
the
twentieth
century
he
must
have
a
name
melisande
dreamily
through
the
forest
he
came
to
me
dressed
in
blue
and
gold
jane
sharply
sandy
struck
with
an
idea
have
you
been
out
all
day
without
your
hat
darling
melisande
vaguely
have
i
jane
i
mean
blue
and
gold
they
do
do
it
nowadays
melisande
nodding
to
her
did
jane
jane
but
how
why
who
can
he
be
melisande
he
said
he
was
a
humble
woodcutter
son
that
means
he
was
a
prince
in
disguise
he
called
me
his
princess
jane
darling
how
could
he
be
a
prince
melisande
i
have
read
stories
sometimes
of
men
who
went
to
sleep
and
woke
up
thousands
of
years
afterwards
and
found
themselves
in
a
different
world
perhaps
jane
lived
in
those
old
days
and
jane
did
he
like
an
ordinary
person
melisande
oh
no
no
jane
well
it
really
extraordinary
was
he
a
gentleman
melisande
smiling
at
her
i
did
ask
him
jane
jane
crossly
you
know
what
i
mean
melisande
he
is
coming
this
afternoon
to
take
me
away
jane
amazed
to
take
you
away
but
what
about
aunt
mary
melisande
vaguely
aunt
mary
what
has
got
to
do
with
it
jane
impatiently
oh
but
with
a
shrug
of
resignation
i
understand
do
you
mean
he
coming
melisande
nods
gravely
melisande
you
let
me
see
him
melisande
yes
i
thought
it
all
out
i
wanted
you
here
jane
he
will
come
in
i
will
present
you
and
then
you
must
leave
us
alone
but
i
should
like
you
to
see
him
just
to
see
how
different
how
utterly
different
he
is
from
every
other
man
but
you
will
promise
to
go
when
you
have
seen
him
wo
you
jane
nodding
i
say
i
afraid
i
must
leave
you
now
and
sandy
how
he
be
a
prince
melisande
when
you
see
him
jane
you
will
say
how
can
he
not
be
a
prince
jane
but
one
has
to
leave
princes
backward
i
mean

melisande
i
do
think
so
besides
after
all

in
just
to
be
on

safe
side

must
leave
you
now
as
i
have
to

my
aunt

then
a
sort
of
not
exactly
a
curtsey
but
she
practises
murmuring
the
words
to
herself
i
suppose
you
did
happen
to
mention
to
him
this
morning
melisande
half
smiling
oh

jane

do
see
why
you

amazement

with

rather
an

cheerfully
well

always
cropping
up

so
different
from
other
men

about
the
things

the
clothes

were
my
true
knight
my
fairy
prince

the
stock
exchange

what
about
beautiful
world
the
world
that

built
up
melisande
i
do
understand
gervase
what
about
pretence
this
morning

thought
you
were
so
different
from
other
women
but
you
just
the
same
just
the
same
you
were
my
true
lady
my
fairy
princess
this
morning
and
this
afternoon
the
queen
your
mother
disabled
herself
by
indigestion
tells
me
that
you
do
all
the
housekeeping
for
her
just
like
any
ordinary
commonplace
girl
your
father
the
king
has
obviously
never
had
a
in
his
hand
in
his
life
your
suitor
prince
robert
of
coote
is
much
more
at
home
with
a
niblick
than
with
a
lance
and
your
cousin
the
lady
jane
melisande
sinking
on
to
the
sofa
and
hiding
her
face
oh
cruel
cruel
gervase
remorsefully
oh
forgive
me
melisande
it
was
horrible
of
me
melisande
no
but
it
true
how
could
any
romance
come
into
this
house
now
you
know
why
i
wanted
you
to
take
me
away
away
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
with
you
gervase
well
that
what
i
want
to
do
melisande
ah
do
when
you
on
the
stock
exchange
gervase
but
there
plenty
of
romance
on
the
stock
exchange
nodding
his
head
oh
yes
you
want
to
look
out
for
it
melisande
reproachfully
now
you
laughing
at
me
again
gervase
my
dear
i
not
or
if
i
am
laughing
at
you
then
i
am
laughing
at
myself
too
and
if
we
can
laugh
together
then
we
can
be
happy
together
melisande
melisande
i
want
romance
i
want
beauty
i
do
want
jokes
gervase
i
see
what
it
is
you
do
like
my
knickerbockers
melisande
bewildered
did
you
expect
me
to
gervase
no
after
a
pause
i
think
that
why
i
put
on
she
looks
at
him
in
surprise
you
see
we
had
to
come
back
to
the
twentieth
century
some
time
we
could
go
on
pretending
for
ever
well
here
we
are
indicating
his
clothes
back
but
i
feel
just
as
romantic
melisande
i
want
beauty
your
beauty
just
as
much
he
goes
to
her
melisande
which
melisande
do
you
want
the
one
who
talked
to
you
this
morning
in
the
wood
or
the
one
who
bitterly
does
all
the
housekeeping
for
her
mother
violently
and
badly
badly
badly
gervase
the
one
who
does
all
the
housekeeping
for
her
mother
and
badly
badly
badly
her
because
she
has
never
realised
what
a
gloriously
romantic
thing
housekeeping
is
melisande
amazed
romantic
gervase
with
enthusiasm
most
gloriously
romantic
did
you
ever
long
when
you
were
young
to
be
wrecked
on
a
desert
island
melisande
clasping
her
hands
oh
yes
gervase
you
imagined
yourself
there
alone
or
with
a
companion
melisande
often
gervase
and
what
were
you
doing
what
is
the
romance
of
the
desert
island
which
draws
us
all
climbing
the
tree
following
the
turtle
to
see
where
it
deposits
its
eggs
discovering
the
spring
of
water
building
the
hut
melisande
or
take
robinson
crusoe
when
man
friday
came
along
and
left
his
footprint
in
the
sand
why
did
robinson
crusoe
stagger
back
in
amazement
because
he
said
to
himself
like
a
good
housekeeper
by
jove
i
on
the
track
of
a
servant
at
last
there
romance
for
you
melisande
smiling
and
shaking
her
head
at
him
what
nonsense
you
talk
gervase
it
is
nonsense
indeed
indeed
it
is
there
romance
everywhere
if
you
look
for
it
look
for
it
in
the
old
but
did
find
it
there
did
the
gentleman
who
had
just
been
given
a
new
pair
of
boots
think
it
romantic
to
be
changed
into
a
fish
he
probably
thought
it
a
confounded
nuisance
and
wondered
what
on
earth
to
do
with
his
boots
did
cinderella
and
the
prince
find
the
world
romantic
after
they
were
married
think
of
the
endless
silent
evenings
which
they
spent
together
with
nothing
in
common
but
an
admiration
for
cinderella
feet
do
you
think
did
long
for
the
romantic
days
of
old
and
in
two
thousand
or
two
hundred
thousand
years
people
will
read
stories
about
and
sigh
and
say
will
those
romantic
days
never
come
back
again
ah
they
are
here
now
melisande
for
for
the
people
with
imagination
for
you
and
for
me
melisande
are
they
oh
if
i
could
believe
they
were
gervase
you
thought
of
me
as
your
lover
and
true
knight
this
morning
ah
but
what
an
easy
thing
to
be
you
were
my
princess
look
at
yourself
in
the
glass
how
can
you
help
being
a
princess
but
if
we
could
be
companions
melisande
that
difficult
that
worth
trying
melisande
gently
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
gervase
get
used
to
me
see
me
in
a
see

a
help

with
my
work

know
how
i
want
to
share
the
world
with
you
for
all
our
lives

long
time

ca

it
on
one
practice
before
breakfast

can
be
lovers
so
easily

we
be
friends
melisande
looking
at
him
gravely
you
are
very
wise
gervase
i
talked
with
a
wise
man
in
the
wood
this
morning
i
been
thinking
over
what
he
said
suddenly
but
when
you
look
at
me
like
that
how
i
long
to
be
a
fool
and
say
come
away
with
me
now
now
now
you
wonderful
beautiful
maddening
woman
you
adorable
child
you
funny
foolish
little
girl
holding
up
a
finger
smile
melisande
smile
slowly
reluctantly
she
gives
him
a
smile
i
suppose
the
fairies
taught
you
that
keep
it
for
will
you
but
give
it
to
me
often
do
you
ever
laugh
melisande
we
must
laugh
together
sometimes
that
makes
life
so
easy
melisande
with
a
happy
little
laugh
oh
what
can
i
say
to
you
gervase
say
i
think
i
should
like
you
for
a
companion
gervase
melisande
shyly
i
think
i
should
like
you
for
a
companion
gervase
gervase
say
please
come
and
see
me
again
gervase
melisande
please
come
and
see
me
again
gervase
gervase
jumping
up
and
waving
his
hand
say
hooray
for
things
melisande
standing
up
but
shyly
still
hooray
for
things
gervase
thank
you
melisande
i
must
go
he
presses
her
hand
and
goes
or
seems
to
be
going
but
suddenly
he
comes
back
bends
on
one
knee
raises
her
hand
on
his
and
kisses
it
my
princess
then
gervase
goes
out
melisande
stays
there
looking
after
him
her
hand
to
her
cheek
but
one
can
not
stand
thus
for
ever
the
new
life
must
begin
with
a
little
smile
at
herself
at
gervase
at
things
she
fetches
out
the
great
book
from
its
where
she
had
buried
it
many
weeks
ago
in
disgust
now
it
comes
into
its
own
she
settles
down
with
it
in
her
favourite
chair
melisande
reading
to
make
take
an
onion
peel
and
quarter
it
and
simmer
it
in
milk
but
you
know
how
the
romantic
passage
goes
we
have
her
with
it
curled
up
in
the
chair
this
adorable
child
this
funny
foolish
little
girl
the
stepmother
a
play
in
one
act
characters
sir
john
pembury
lady
pembury
perkins
the
stranger
the
first
performance
of

following
cast
sir

a
summer
morning
the
sunniest
and
perhaps
the
pleasantest
room
in
the
london
house
of
sir
john
pembury
for
this
reason
lady
pembury
uses
it
a
good
deal
although
it
is
not
officially
hers
it
is
plainly
furnished
and
probably
set
out
to
be
a
sort
of
for
sir

many
callers
but
lady

has
left
her
mark
upon
it

stoutness
but
not
yet
past
his
prime
leads
the
may
in
followed
by
the
stranger
perkins
has
already
placed
him
as
one
of
the
lower
classes
but
the
intelligent
person
in
the
pit
perceives
that
he
is
something
better
than
that
though
whether
he
is
in
the
process
of
falling
from
a
higher
estate
or
of
rising
to
it
is
not
so
clear
he
is
thirty
odd
shabbily
dressed
but
then
so
are
most
of
us
nowadays
and
ill
at
ease
not
because
he
is
shabby
but
because
he
is
ashamed
of
himself
to
make
up
for
this
he
adopts
a
blustering
manner
as
if
to
persuade
himself
that
he
is
a
fine
fellow
after
all
there
is
a
touch
of
commonness
about
his
voice
but
he
is
not
uneducated

gently

pembury
when
did
she
die
proud
mother
stranger
sulkily
well
why
should
she
be
proud
after
a
pause
two
years
ago
if
you
want
to
know
lady
pembury
it
was
then
that
you
found
out
who
your
father
was
stranger
that
right
i
found
these
old
letters
she
kept
them
locked
up
all
those
years
bit
of
luck
for
me
lady
pembury
almost
to
herself
and
that
was
two
years
ago
and
for
two
years
you
had
your
hopes
your
ambitions
for
two
years
you
were
proud
and
independent
why
did
you
not
come
to
us
then
stranger
with
a
touch
of
vanity
well
i
was
getting
on
all
right
you
know
and
lady
pembury
and
then
suddenly
after
two
years
you
lost
hope
stranger
i
lost
my
job
lady
pembury
poor
boy
and
could
get
another
stranger
bitterly
it
a
beast
of
a
world
if
you
down
he
in
the
gutter
kick
him
down
trample
on
him
nobody
wants
him
the
way
to
treat
them
when
they
down
trample
on
lady
pembury
and
so
you
came
to
your
father
to
help
you
up
again
to
help
you
out
of
the
gutter
stranger
that
right
lady
pembury
pleadingly
ah
but
give
him
a
chance
stranger
now
look
here
i
told
you
already
that
i
not
going
to
have
any
of
game
lady
pembury
shaking
her
head
sadly
foolish
boy
you
understand
give
him
a
chance
to
help
you
out
of
the
gutter
stranger
well
i
is
that
what
i
am
doing
lady
pembury
no
no
you
asking
him
to
trample
you
right
down
into
it
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
mud
and
slime
i
want
you
to
let
him
help
you
back
to
where
you
were
two
years
ago
when
you
were
proud
and
hopeful
stranger
looking
at
her
in
a
puzzled
way
i
ca
make
out
what
your
game
is
it
no
good
pretending
you
do
hate
the
sight
of
me
it
stands
to
reason
you
must
lady
pembury
smiling
but
then
women
unreasonable
they
and
i
think
it
is
only
in
that
stepmothers
are
always
so
unkind
stranger
surprised
stepmother
lady
pembury
well
that
practically
what
i
am
is
it
whimsically
i
never
been
a
stepmother
before
persuasively
could
you
let
me
be
proud
of
my
stepson
stranger
well
you
a
one
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
and
your
husband
are
going
to
have
a
row
about
this
lady
pembury
it
rather
late
to
begin
a
row
is
it
thirty
years
after
it
happened
besides
perhaps
you
are
going
to
tell
him
anything
about
it
stranger
but
what
else
have
i
come
for
except
to
tell
him
lady
pembury
to
tell
i
asked
you
to
give
him
a
chance
of
helping
you
out
of
your
troubles
but
i
rather
you
gave
the
chance
you
see
john
would
be
very
unhappy
if
he
knew
that
i
knew
this
and
he
would
have
to
tell
me
because
when
a
man
has
been
happily
married
to
anybody
for
years
he
ca
really
keep
a
secret
from
the
other
one
he
pretends
to
himself
that
he
can
but
he
knows
all
the
time
what
a
miserable
pretence
it
is
and
so
john
would
tell
me
and
say
he
was
sorry
and
i
would
say
it
all
right
darling
i
knew
but
it
would
make
him
ashamed
and
he
would
be
afraid
that
perhaps
i
was
thinking
him
such
a
wonderful
man
as
i
did
before
and
it
very
bad
for
a
public
man
like
john
when
he
begins
to
lose
faith
in
what
his
wife
is
thinking
about
him
so
let
be
your
friend
will
you
there
is
a
silence
between
them
for
a
little
he
looks
at
her
wonderingly
suddenly
she
stands
up
her
finger
to
her
lips
it
john
she
moves
away
from
him
sir
john
pembury
comes
in
quickly
big
decisive
friendly

man
who
wears
very
naturally
and
without
any
an
air
of
being
somebody

wife

are
waiting
to
see
perkins

something

important
stranger
i

then
back
with
a
smile
at
the
stranger

good

special
claim

i
shall

shall
hope
i
shall
pray
she
holds
out
her

again
stranger
shaking
his
head
wait
till
you
hear
from
me
he
goes
to
the
door
and
then
stops
and

slowly
back
he
says
awkwardly

stands
watching

as

she
waits
after

has
gone
thinking
her
own
thoughts
out
of

she
comes
with
something
of
a
shock
as
