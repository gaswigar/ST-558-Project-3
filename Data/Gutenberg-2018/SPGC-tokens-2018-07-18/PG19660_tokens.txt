chapter
cadet
george
hanlon
stood
stiffly
at
attention
but
as
the
long
long
minutes
dragged
on
and
on
he
found
his
hands
his
spine
and
his
forehead
cold
with
the
sweat
of
fear
he
tried
manfully
to
keep
his
eyes
fixed
steadily
on
that
emotionless
face
before
him
but
found
it
almost
impossible
to
do
so
tension
grew
and
grew
and
grew
in
the
room
until
it
seemed
the
very
walls
must
bulge
or
the
windows
burst
to
relieve
the
pressure
the
cadet
felt
he
could
not
stand
another
minute
of
it
without
screaming
why
did
that
monster
say
something
what
kind
of
torture
was
this
anyway
and
why
was
he
here
in
the
first
place
he
could
think
of
a
single
reg
he
had
broken
yet
why
else
would
he
be
called
before
admiral
rogers
the
dread
commandant
of
cadets
in
spite
of
his
utmost
efforts
to
stand
eye
to
eye
with
the
commandant
hanlon
could
keep
his
gaze
steadily
on
that
feared
visage
his
eyes
insisted
on
straying
time
after
time
although
he
always
forced
them
back
he
caught
glimpses
of
the
dozens
of
communicator
studs
and
plates
on
the
huge
metal
desk
he
saw
the
bit
of
scenery
showing
through
the
window
he
noted
the
pictures
of
great
corps
heroes
that
adorned
the
walls
in
fact
he
had
to
look
at
anything
except
those
boring
impassive
eyes
fixed
so
steadily
on
his
own
face
if
only
he
could
gain
such
perfect
control
of
his
nerves
if
only
he
knew
what
this
was
all
about
by
the
big
wall
chronom
he
saw
he
had
already
been
standing
there
at
rigid
attention
a
full
five
minutes
the
second
hand
crept
around
again
six
minutes
it
dragged
slowly
around
once
again
seven
minutes
then
the
unbearable
silence
was
mercifully
broken
by
the
voice
in
some
ways
mister
you
quite
a
stupid
young
man
he
said
inclined
to
be
disappointed
in
you
hanlon
gave
a
start
of
surprise
and
forced
himself
to
scrutinize
more
carefully
that
enigmatic
face
what
what
do
you
mean
sir
the
stern
eyes
were
still
boring
into
his
but
now
the
cadet
thought
he
could
detect
a
trace
of
secret
amusement
behind
them
why
do
you
torture
yourself
like
this
you
know
how
to
find
out
what
it
all
about
there
was
a
sinking
feeling
in
george
hanlon
mind
did
that
mean
what
he
was
afraid
it
meant
he
sent
out
a
tentative
feeler
of
thought
toward
the
mind
behind
that
expressionless
face
he
expected
to
find
it
difficult
to
do
because
of
long
disuse
of
the
faculty
but
he
was
amazed
both
at
the
ease
with
which
the
technique
returned
to
him
and
with
the
feeling
of
warm
friendliness
he
found
in
that
mind
almost
like
a
sort
of
fatherly
pride
he
probed
a
bit
deeper
and
was
aware
of
assurance
that
he
had
done
nothing
to
merit
punishment
indeed
it
seemed
he
could
catch
exactly
the
opposite
feeling
he
must
have
shown
his
relief
for
the
commandant
stern
face
relaxed
into
a
broad
smile
and
he
lounged
back
in
his
big
chair
that
better
at
ease
and
sit
down
slowly
disbelieving
the
sudden
change
the
astonished
young
cadet
gingerly
sank
onto
the
front
edge
of
a
chair
he
had
to
his
legs
were
suddenly
rubbery
i
i
do
understand
at
all
sir
the
admiral
leaned
forward
and
spoke
impressively
do
you
think
cadet
hanlon
that
we
would
let
any
man
get
to
within
weeks
of
graduation
without
knowing
all
about
him
the
young
man
eyes
widened
and
his
hands
clutched
at
his
knees
in
an
effort
to
keep
them
from
shaking
oh
yes
we
know
all
about
you
george
spencer
newton
hanlon
and
the
cadet
eyes
opened
even
wider
at
that
name
we
know
about
your
talent
for
as
a
child
and
how
you
suppressed
it
as
you
grew
older
and
found
how
it
got
you
into
trouble
we
know
all
about
your
disgrace
and
disappearance
your
mother
death
your
running
away
and
your
adoption
by
the
hanlons
whose
last
name
you
assumed
how
how
you
learn
all
that
sir
the
corps
has
its
ways
and
that
why
you
here
now
oh
all
the
fifth
year
cadets
will
be
interviewed
by
myself
or
my
assistants
this
coming
week
to
determine
their
first
assignment
after
graduation
but
i
called
you
in
today
for
a
very
very
special
reason
and
your
ability
to
read
minds
is
part
of
it
the
cadet
drew
himself
up
stiffly
i
through
with
all
that
sir
definitely
the
commandant
regarded
him
enigmatically
for
a
moment
just
what
do
you
expect
to
do
in
the
corps
mister
why
whatever
i
assigned
to
do
i
suppose
sir
or
whatever
i
can
do
and
just
how
far
will
you
go
for
the
corps
the
admiral
leaned
forward
and
eyed
him
critically
all
the
way
sir
of
course
do
you
believe
a
corpsman
should
use
all
his
abilities
in
his
service
the
question
was
barked
at
him
certainly
sir
but
his
eyes
showed
he
realized
he
had
been
trapped
by
that
admission
you
one
of
the
few
persons
known
who
have
ever
actually
been
able
to
read
another
mind
that
important
very
important
to
the
corps
must
be
used
hanlon
eyes
were
still
stormy
but
he
kept
his
lips
tightly
closed
the
commandant
face
grew
kindly
again
we
know
how
it
got
you
into
trouble
when
you
were
a
boy
because
the
other
children
resented
it
and
avoided
or
abused
you
for
using
it
on
them
but
now
it
will
be
a
great
assistance
to
you
and
to
the
corps
we
know
you
will
use
that
talent
wisely
for
it
has
been
proven
time
and
again
by
test
after
test
that
you
are
scrupulously
honest
you
lost
your
allowance
several
times
in
card
games
when
you
could
have
read
what
cards
your
opponents
held
and
so
won
you
have
let
yourself
fail
on
examination
questions
you
did
not
know
when
you
could
have
read
the
answers
in
your
instructor
mind
no
not
that
sir
hanlon
shook
his
head
i
never
could
read
from
a
mind
such
specific
information
as
answers
to
questions
or
to
problems
i
imagine
that
will
come
when
you
start
using
your
talent
maturely
admiral
rogers
shrugged
indifferently
but
at
the
moment
i
want
to
talk
very
seriously
about
your
assignment
first
however
i
must
have
your
most
solemn
oath
never
to
reveal
what
i
am
about
to
tell
you
for
it
is
our
most
secret
i
swear
by
my
mother
memory
sir
never
to
reveal
anything
i
am
told
to
keep
confidential
very
well
i
have
been
delegated
by
the
high
command
to
ask
you
to
join
the
secret
service
of
the
corps
cadet
george
hanlon
drew
in
a
sharp
startled
breath
and
from
his
chair
the
the
secret
service
sir
i
did
know
there
was
one
i
told
you
it
was
top
secret
admiral
rogers
said
impressively
we
believe
no
one
knows
anything
about
its
existence
outside
of
the
membership
of
that
service
and
officers
of
the
rank
of
rear
admiral
or
above
the
young
cadet
sat
silent
his
eyes
on
the
tips
of
his
polished
boots
as
though
to
see
reflected
there
the
answer
to
this
astounding
new
situation
that
had
been
slapped
into
his
consciousness
this
was
all
so
utterly
unforeseen
he
had
dreamed
of
doing
great
deeds
in
the
corps
of
course
but
actually
had
never
expected
to
be
assigned
to
anything
but
routine
work
at
first
his
mind
was
a
chaotic
whirlpool
of
conjectures
how
could
he
fit
into
such
an
organization
why
had
he
been
selected
surely
the
fact
that
as
a
child
he
was
supposed
to
have
been
a
was
enough
or
was
it
from
their
standpoint
after
some
time
he
looked
up
i
do
know
as
i
make
a
very
good
detective
sir
admiral
rogers
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
breaking
the
tension
i
think
and
so
do
the
top
men
of
the
secret
service
who
have
studied
you
thoroughly
that
you
will
soon
become
one
of
its
most
useful
members
that
was
another
shock
but
out
of
it
grew
determination
very
well
sir
i
try
it
good
but
not
it
hanlon
once
you
in
it
for
life
and
there
one
other
thing
i
have
told
you
yet
i
could
until
after
you
had
agreed
to
join
this
may
make
you
change
your
mind
which
you
are
still
at
liberty
to
do
the
cadet
throat
tightened
and
he
moistened
his
lips
as
he
saw
the
admiral
face
grow
ominous
i
want
you
to
consider
this
very
seriously
he
said
slowly
grimly
and
hanlon
probing
mind
caught
the
aura
of
importance
in
his
manner
take
your
time
and
figure
carefully
all
the
angles
and
connotations
inherent
in
it
for
it
will
not
be
an
easy
decision
to
make
he
paused
impressively
here
it
is
cold
you
have
to
be
apparently
dismissed
from
the
corps
in
disgrace
that
is
horribly
harsh
we
know
he
added
quickly
compassionately
as
he
saw
the
look
of
dismay
that
whitened
the
cadet
face
but
we
have
found
over
the
years
that
it
is
the
best
way
to
make
members
of
the
ss
most
valuable
to
us
every
one
of
them
has
gone
through
the
same
thing
if
that
is
any
encouragement
or
consolation
young
hanlon
spirits
sank
to
absolute
nadir
not
not
even
graduate
he
whispered
agonizedly
not
publicly
with
your
class
no
but
you
be
given
private
graduation
for
you
still
be
a
member
of
the
corps
he
was
silent
again
to
allow
the
young
man
to
recover
a
bit
then
continued
in
a
fatherly
voice
we
know
it
a
terrible
price
to
ask
any
man
to
pay
it
takes
guts
to
withstand
publicly
and
willingly
the
dishonor
the
loss
of
friends
and
the
good
will
of
people
who
know
you
it
means
disgrace
in
the
eyes
of
the
public
and
those
members
of
the
corps
who
have
ever
known
you
or
will
hear
of
you
the
blood
drained
from
hanlon
face
his
breathing
was
quick
and
rasping
the
admiral
heart
went
out
to
him
in
sympathy
but
he
had
to
keep
on
now
though
he
tried
to
soften
the
blow
yet
there
are
rewards
in
honor
from
those
who
do
know
there
will
come
a
deep
satisfaction
from
the
years
of
devoting
your
life
and
abilities
to
the
tremendous
service
of
maintaining
peace
and
security
for
all
mankind
of
the
entire
federation
of
planets
actually
the
ss
does
more
to
keep
that
peace
than
all
the
rest
of
the
corps
so
these
things
are
in
the
estimation
of
those
who
have
gone
through
it
well
worth
any
pain
and
humiliation
they
have
to
suffer
his
tone
was
so
kind
that
hanlon
found
a
measure
of
comfort
in
the
looks
and
attitude
of
the
officer
before
him
now
suddenly
not
a
dread
ogre
and
martinet
but
a
kindly
fatherly
understanding
friend
george
hanlon
sat
with
downcast
eyes
thinking
swiftly
but
more
cogently
than
he
had
ever
done
before
he
had
come
into
this
room
still
a
boy
despite
his
years
now
abruptly
he
was
roughly
forced
into
manhood
as
such
an
adult
then
he
quickly
realized
this
was
the
crucial
point
in
his
life
to
date
probably
in
all
the
years
to
come
but
to
lose
the
respect
and
friendship
of
everyone
he
knew
he
shuddered
to
be
despised
an
outcast
yet
admiral
rogers
said
all
the
ss
men
had
gone
through
it
and
now
felt
it
worth
all
the
pain
and
disgrace
to
be
able
to
do
the
work
they
were
doing
he
had
been
trained
all
his
life
and
especially
in
corps
school
to
scan
all
available
data
for
and
against
each
problem
that
arose
and
then
make
a
decision
quickly
and
intelligently
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
straightened
determinedly
i
still
take
it
on
sir
if
you
and
the
general
staff
think
i
worthy
and
will
be
useful
the
admiral
rose
swiftly
and
came
around
the
desk
to
grasp
the
hands
in
both
of
his
i
proud
of
you
my
boy
it
took
real
strength
of
character
to
make
that
decision
i
sure
you
will
never
regret
it
though
there
be
moments
when
it
will
hurt
to
the
pit
of
your
soul
especially
the
first
few
days
the
cadet
eyes
clouded
again
and
he
shivered
convulsively
that
part
got
me
in
a
blue
funk
no
fooling
do
you
suppose
i
can
take
it
and
not
give
the
show
away
again
the
commandant
hearty
friendly
laugh
boomed
out
filling
the
office
with
merriment
and
honest
pride
by
snyder
you
will
son
like
a
thoroughbred
he
went
back
behind
that
great
desk
and
was
suddenly
once
more
the
strict
disciplinarian
cadet
hanlon
he
barked
the
young
man
stood
rigid
raise
your
right
hand
do
you
swear
before
the
infinite
essence
to
uphold
with
all
your
abilities
the
corps
and
the
laws
and
decisions
of
the
federated
planets
on
my
honor
sir
and
with
god
help
i
pledge
allegiance
to
the
corps
and
to
the
people
and
governments
of
all
the
federated
planets
hanlon
came
to
a
punctilious
salute
which
admiral
rogers
returned
as
precisely
before
resuming
his
seat
senior
lieutenant
george
hanlon
at
ease
he
grinned
companionably
at
the
young
man
start
of
surprise
promotions
are
swift
in
the
secret
service
hanlon
now
go
through
that
door
there
you
meet
your
immediate
superior
officer
who
will
give
you
instructions
and
hanlon
my
sincerest
personal
good
wishes
safe
flights
lieutenant
thank
you
sir
for
everything
chapter
senior
lieutenant
george
hanlon
opened
the
designated
door
and
stepped
through
into
the
next
office
a
man
wearing
the
twin
comets
of
a
regional
admiral
was
sitting
behind
a
desk
studying
some
papers
he
continued
sitting
thus
the
papers
held
so
they
hid
his
face
apparently
so
intent
on
his
work
he
had
not
noticed
anyone
entering
but
hanlon
instinctively
knew
better
and
stood
stiffly
at
attention
awaiting
the
other
pleasure
soon
the
man
lowered
the
papers
and
hanlon
gasped
da
his
mouth
snapped
shut
and
his
eyes
became
swiftly
hostile
at
remembrance
of
the
hate
he
had
carried
all
these
years
on
account
of
this
man
he
wanted
to
stalk
out
but
ingrained
discipline
chained
him
to
the
spot
his
voice
though
was
very
cold
when
he
spoke
senior
lieutenant
george
hanlon
reporting
sir
the
big
man
was
a
startling
older
edition
of
the
lieutenant
only
grey
where
the
latter
was
blond
assured
from
long
bitter
experience
where
the
other
was
as
yet
untried
now
he
rose
to
his
feet
acknowledging
the
salute
at
ease
i
can
imagine
your
surprise
at
seeing
me
and
if
there
was
a
hurt
look
on
his
face
at
sight
of
that
implacable
hatred
in
his
eyes
and
demeanor
he
could
not
be
blamed
however
i
think
your
experience
of
the
past
hour
might
have
prepared
you
for
sight
of
me
in
uniform
yes
as
he
saw
the
sudden
surprise
in
the
young
man
eyes
that
was
the
reason
for
my
apparent
disgrace
i
hope
you
will
forgive
me
now
that
you
know
why
it
was
necessary
of
course
stiffly
punctilious
only
his
eyes
were
still
hard
and
stormy
was
it
important
enough
to
break
mother
heart
the
older
man
voice
grew
soft
and
shook
with
genuine
emotion
you
and
everyone
had
to
believe
that
spence
all
these
years
i
been
prayerfully
waiting
for
the
day
when
i
could
explain
to
you
i
can
assure
you
son
with
all
the
sincerity
his
voice
could
carry
that
she
did
not
die
of
a
broken
i
know
bet
you
do
not
know
better
his
father
interrupted
sternly
please
wait
until
i
finish
explaining
no
spence
his
voice
was
still
emphatic
but
softer
now
almost
pleading
she
knew
and
approved
your
mother
was
one
of
earth
greatest
heroines
hanlon
was
still
standing
stiffly
but
now
his
eyes
clouded
with
mixed
emotions
of
which
doubt
predominated
his
mind
touched
that
of
his
father
and
he
seemed
to
read
truth
there
but
could
he
believe
this
now
after
all
those
dreadful
years
actually
his
father
was
continuing
your
mother
had
become
a
victim
of
multiple
sclerosis
when
we
knew
she
had
less
than
two
months
to
live
i
talked
to
her
with
the
corps
permission
about
my
going
into
secret
service
work
with
her
death
so
near
it
could
be
done
convincingly
believing
you
would
understand
some
day
and
approve
she
agreed
i
terribly
sorry
for
all
you
had
to
suffer
during
the
intervening
years
again
i
beg
forgiveness
as
his
father
talked
hanlon
eyes
and
heart
gradually
lost
their
hardness
and
at
the
end
he
ran
forward
and
grasped
the
other
hands
oh
dad
i
so
sorry
i
hated
hating
you
if
it
had
been
for
the
long
talks
pa
and
ma
hanlon
had
with
me
i
do
believe
i
would
ever
have
gone
into
the
cadet
school
the
older
man
hugged
his
son
hungrily
believe
me
spence
it
was
easy
for
me
either
but
i
actually
desert
you
even
though
it
had
to
seem
so
i
know
everywhere
you
been
everything
you
done
you
been
watched
over
constantly
i
engineered
your
adoption
by
the
hanlons
he
was
a
retired
corpsman
you
know
and
i
paid
your
expenses
you
see
i
happen
to
love
my
son
very
much
and
i
loved
my
dad
so
too
that
why
it
hurt
say
now
i
can
change
my
name
back
ca
i
the
hanlons
both
died
since
i
started
cadet
school
you
know
well
no
for
the
time
being
i
think
not
you
well
known
as
now
and
you
better
leave
it
that
way
for
now
at
least
however
you
find
need
of
an
alias
from
time
to
time
in
this
new
job
you
can
use
it
then
i
certainly
will
be
proud
to
have
you
wearing
my
name
again
but
both
men
were
shying
away
from
all
this
frank
expression
of
their
emotion
and
hanlon
dropped
back
a
pace
how
does
it
happen
i
never
seen
you
around
the
buildings
or
grounds
here
no
one
ever
sees
me
in
uniform
except
in
this
or
some
other
base
office
on
special
occasions
outside
i
always
disguised
when
i
come
into
a
reservation
i
a
bearded
janitor
or
something
you
soon
learn
about
disguising
yourself
then
he
became
all
business
and
his
face
sobered
as
he
went
back
to
his
desk
sit
there
lieutenant
there
a
lot
to
tell
you
and
you
are
to
pay
strict
attention
and
get
it
all
in
this
one
interview
for
there
be
another
at
this
time
it
would
attract
too
much
attention
for
you
to
be
called
here
more
than
this
once
he
smiled
again
with
a
warm
fatherly
pride
first
let
me
congratulate
you
officially
on
your
decision
and
to
welcome
you
sincerely
into
the
secret
service
hanlon
bowed
in
acknowledgement
then
sat
down
and
leaned
forward
attentively
i
try
to
get
it
all
sir
first
the
matter
of
your
dismissal
it
will
come
some
time
within
the
next
few
days
but
even
i
wo
know
ahead
of
time
when
or
how
it
will
happen
some
ss
man
unknown
on
terra
will
be
called
in
to
attend
to
it
but
when
it
does
come
you
will
recognize
it
almost
instantly
and
you
must
play
it
up
big
do
let
on
in
any
way
that
you
suspect
or
know
it
is
anything
but
genuine
you
must
impress
on
your
fellow
students
and
upon
everyone
else
you
know
or
later
come
to
know
that
it
was
real
and
that
it
has
soured
you
for
all
time
on
the
corps
and
on
all
law
and
order
and
government
the
young
man
nodded
but
said
nothing
for
his
throat
was
clogged
and
his
spirits
quailing
at
thought
of
that
public
disgrace
he
had
been
so
proud
here
how
could
he
possibly
stand
giving
it
all
up
maybe
he
was
a
fool
ever
to
have
agreed
but
the
admiral
was
continuing
he
shoved
a
sheaf
of
bills
across
the
desk
here
a
thousand
credits
use
them
to
buy
your
civilian
clothes
and
kit
after
your
dismissal
buy
a
few
shares
of
some
stock
too
the
amount
or
value
does
matter
get
a
small
insurance
policy
yes
seeing
his
son
questioning
look
there
a
reason
after
you
get
your
clothing
and
things
and
have
discarded
your
uniform
go
rent
a
hotel
room
then
go
to
the
bank
and
rent
a
safety
deposit
box
that
one
of
the
first
things
you
do
in
each
city
on
any
planet
to
which
you
may
be
sent
on
assignment
now
here
are
two
keys
that
fit
box
number
in
all
the
banks
they
are
special
master
keys
of
our
own
designing
box
is
used
because
of
its
nearness
to
those
private
booths
in
the
universal
all
banks
use
that
box
is
our
means
of
confidential
communication
after
you
get
into
the
vault
ostensibly
to
get
into
your
own
box
use
these
to
open
box
there
a
little
electronic
gadget
in
each
box
when
you
want
immediate
service
on
anything
you
put
into
the
box
press
the
red
button
on
the
mechanism
go
back
a
few
hours
later
and
it
will
have
been
attended
to
so
now
when

into
the
bank

a
note
there
listing
your
hotel
room

and
also
your
new

number
come
back
in
a
couple
of
hours
and
you
find
a
key
that
will
have
your
box
number
stamped
on
it
but
which
will
open
both
boxes
then
leave
your
old
key
and
one
of
these
in
and
carry
the
other
and
the
new
one
oh

see
the
stock

vault

your
local
address
there
as
soon
as
feasible
that
your
one
sure
contact
also
in
each
box
find
quite
a
lot
of
money
at
all
times
you
take
what
you
need
for
expenses
and
get
your
salary
that
way
if
your
job
calls
for
more
than
is
in
the
box
at
any
time
leave
a
request
and
press
the
red
button
more
will
be
brought
immediately
that
quite
a
trust
sir
hanlon
gulped
i
hope
i
always
use
it
wisely
his
father
nodded
and
smiled
you
will
spence
we
would
have
asked
you
to
join
us
if
we
were
sure
as
your
father
i
mighty
proud
to
have
you
for
a
son
as
assistant
chief
of
the
ss
i
feel
sure
you
be
a
credit
to
us
now
all
business
again
a
sleep
instructor
and
some
reels
of
the
language
and
other
information
about
simonides
four
will
be
delivered
to
your
hotel
room
simonides
four
is
your
first
assignment
something
fishy
going
on
there
we
have
been
able
to
find
out
about
but
we
think
you
can
get
us
some
good
leads
do
try
to
handle
it
alone
just
get
us
information
and
son
use
your
talent
for
reading
minds
i
heard
over
the
intercom
all
you
said
to
rogers
and
while
that
was
the
only
reason
you
were
asked
into
the
ss
believe
me
it
will
be
tremendously
important
in
your
work
with
us
it
help
us
where
no
other
agent
can
get
to
first
check
station
and
i
have
a
feeling
too
that
you
develop
both
that
and
many
other
mental
abilities
once
your
mind
starts
to
hit
the
ball
you
find
in
this
work
every
single
talent
and
ability
you
can
develop
will
be
useful
and
needed
yes
hanlon
nodded
slowly
i
beginning
to
realize
that
practice
a
lot
as
for
money
do
be
niggardly
spend
what
you
like
and
always
carry
quite
a
bit
with
you
for
emergencies
live
well
although
not
extravagantly
unless
the
occasion
of
your
work
demands
it
not
to
save
money
but
to
remain
as
inconspicuous
as
possible
the
service
has
it
all
thought
out
has
it
admiration
shone
in
the
young
lieutenant
eyes
they
had
a
lot
of
years
for
it
spence
now
there
another
means
of
contact
for
cases
of
emergency
get
word
to
or
an
interview
with
any
officer
of
the
rank
of
rear
admiral
or
above
the
words
seven
are
the
passwords
to
let
him
know
who
and
what
you
are
once
you
made
that
contact
commandeer
anything
or
any
service
needed
to
assist
your
work
i
understand
sir
hanlon
strained
to
review
all
this
new
knowledge
quickly
then
i
sure
i
have
it
all
get
civilian
kit
hotel
room
stocks
and
insurance
deposit
boxes
my
own
and
simonidean
seven
correct
now
you
be
interested
in
a
little
of
the
background
of
the
secret
service
it
was
john
snyder
himself
who
organized
it
shortly
after
the
formation
of
the
snyder
patrol
he
realized
almost
at
once
that
such
an
unknown
undercover
echelon
would
be
a
must
usually
not
more
than
two
hundred
of
us
new
members
are
taken
in
only
as
replacements
or
when
some
corpsman
with
a
special
ability
such
as
your
is
discovered
we
work
anywhere
throughout
space
when
there
a
need
but
there
are
usually
one
or
two
of
us
on
each
planet
of
the
federation
at
all
times
when
not
on
any
special
assignment
we
keep
busy
on
some
planet
not
our
original
home
checking
the
background
of
cadets
or
government
workers
guarding
vip
and
such
other
vital
matters
but
whatever
we
are
or
whatever
we
are
doing
we
the
corps
we
are
mighty
proud
of
the
fact
that
no
ss
man
has
ever
betrayed
his
trust
even
to
save
his
life
our
work
is
dangerous
in
the
extreme
but
without
exception
we
are
all
men
with
high
mental
ability
clever
and
unusually
adept
at
getting
out
of
scrapes
he
grimaced
mirthlessly
we
learn
that
last
mighty
quick
in
this
business
if
we
last
and
to
all
of
us
our
dangerous
unadvertised
publicly
unrecognized
work
is
personally
highly
satisfying
we
know
we
are
the
guardians
of
the
peace
of
the
federation
even
though
we
get
no
from
the
populace
who
do
know
we
exist
hanlon
nodded
slowly
thoughtfully
one
thing
puzzles
me
dad
you
and
admiral
rogers
both
spoke
about
how
secret
all
this
is
yet
i
was
given
the
chance
to
back
out
after
i
knew
about
it
his
father
grinned
several
have
over
the
years
they
underwent
treatment
to
erase
that
knowledge
from
their
mind
he
stood
up
and
came
around
the
desk
to
where
his
son
had
also
risen
i
may
not
see
you
again
before
you
leave
spence
george
i
mean
he
smiled
ruefully
then
brightened
but
the
best
of
luck
son
and
keep
in
mind
that
you
have
the
honor
of
the
finest
body
of
men
in
the
universe
in
your
keeping
and
always
try
to
be
worthy
of
the
trust
i
will
sir
gravely
it
seems
almost
too
much
responsibility
for
a
cub
like
me
and
i
scared
but
i
do
my
best
take
it
easy
at
first
do
try
too
much
and
do
put
yourself
in
any
more
danger
than
you
have
to
until
you
learn
the
ropes
which
you
will
faster
than
you
may
now
think
on
this
assignment
all
we
ask
is
that
you
try
to
get
us
some
leads
we
can
work
on
right
i
do
want
to
conk
out
too
soon
now
i
got
a
lot
of
living
i
want
to
do
first
especially
now
i
got
my
dad
back
again
i
sure
hope
we
manage
to
see
each
other
fairly
often
oh
we
undoubtedly
will
except
when
one
or
the
other
of
us
is
on
a
long
job
we
meet
somewhere
quite
often
about
this
assignment
of
mine
dad
can
you
give
me
any
dope
on
it
you
get
what
any
of
us
know
from
the
reels
and
the
latest
development
from
the
box
when
you
ready
to
start
out
oh
yes
i
almost
forgot
the
paper
we
use
is
a
digestible
plastic
so
make
a
meal
off
all
orders
and
confidential
communications
you
receive
the
box
always
contains
a
supply
for
your
reports
or
requests
for
specific
information
or
assistance
saves
money
on
feed
bills
eh
his
father
grinned
appreciatively
then
sobered
make
sure
you
understand
each
step
you
take
first
and
do
try
to
run
until
you
know
how
to
crawl
well
safe
flights
spence
safe
flights
to
you
too
dad
always
and
i
want
you
to
know
i
so
glad
to
have
all
those
horrible
misunderstandings
and
hates
cleared
away
i
missed
my
boy
too
but
rewards
you
know
with
mixed
sensations
of
high
elation
and
worried
fear
the
young
corpsman
walked
slowly
through
the
beautiful
park
that
surrounded
the
great
skyscraper
that
housed
the
cadets
during
their
training
period
his
thoughts
were
as
twisted
as
were
the
meandering
paths
and
walks
he
trod
so
unseeingly
chapter
as
hanlon
entered
his
dormitory
room
his
roommate
looked
up
from
his
studies
what
the
big
brass
bull
want
han
huh
hanlon
snapped
out
of
his
abstraction
and
grinned
nothing
important
you
be
up
soon
just
about
our
first
assignments
after
graduation
he
was
thinking
swiftly
uh
i
get
some
extra
instruction
in
piloting
and
a
chance
at
the
controls
gee
i
hope
they
let
me
work
on
codes
hanlon
shrugged
they
probably
will
dick
they
try
to
fit
us
where
we
can
do
the
most
good
rogers
said
he
picked
up
a
book
and
sat
down
apparently
studying
intently
and
young
trowbridge
resumed
his
own
lessons
hanlon
began
practicing
his
at
every
opportunity
at
first
he
felt
sure
he
would
be
caught
at
it
but
quickly
remembered
that
as
a
child
his
victims
never
suspected
they
were
being
mentally
invaded
unless
he
told
them
or
acted
carelessly
upon
information
so
gleaned
yet
it
had
been
his
naive
boyish
pride
then
that
had
made
him
boast
to
his
playmates
of
his
ability
and
prove
it
by
telling
them
things
he
had
learned
about
them
all
that
naturally
got
him
into
much
trouble
and
not
a
few
fights
and
caused
the
loss
of
all
his
early
boyhood
friends
that
was
why
he
had
quit
using
his
wild
talent
and
had
been
so
determined
never
to
do
so
again
as
he
had
first
told
admiral
rogers
but
now
he
realized
he
must
use
it
with
all
the
ability
and
skill
he
could
acquire
for
this
whatever
of
it
he
could
do
was
decidedly
his
dish
the
ss
would
be
sure
to
hand
him
all
the
jobs
where
it
might
best
get
them
what
they
needed
if
he
showed
he
could
produce
yet
with
his
present
equipment
hanlon
knew
he
could
do
little
as
he
had
also
told
the
commandant
he
could
actually
read
anyone
mind
to
the
extent
of
getting
definite
wording
or
specific
information
but
he
could
get
quite
clear
sensory
impressions
that
helped
him
deduce
what
the
other
person
was
thinking
he
had
partially
learned
and
now
practiced
with
all
his
abilities
and
gained
knowledge
and
intellect
to
improve
and
perfect
the
technique
to
gauge
the
other
looks
glances
facial
expressions
muscle
movements
sudden
tensenesses
and
so
on
for
those
together
with
the
and
bits
of
fleeting
thoughts
enabled
him
to
know
almost
to
a
certainty
what
the
other
was
actually
thinking
at
the
observed
time
in
the
barracks
later
that
first
evening
he
got
into
a
card
game
and
concentrated
on
trying
to
win
by
this
method
nor
was
it
consciously
that
he
chose
a
game
being
played
for
low
stakes
he
just
would
have
thought
of
trying
to
win
large
sums
by
such
cheating
for
some
time
he
won
consistently
and
easily
he
could
know
what
cards
his
opponents
held
by
suit
or
number
but
he
could
tell
without
any
difficulty
whether
each
of
the
other
players
felt
he
had
a
poor
medium
or
good
hand
by
playing
his
own
accordingly
his
wins
were
far
greater
than
his
losses
after
an
hour
or
so
of
play
had
proved
he
could
do
it
and
had
given
him
considerable
practice
hanlon
closed
his
mind
to
their
impressions
he
now
played
his
cards
so
recklessly
he
soon
lost
his
winnings
then
he
got
out
of
the
game
on
a
plea
of
having
to
study
the
next
morning
during
first
class
the
door
opened
and
admiral
rogers
entered
the
classroom
the
teacher
called
springing
to
his
feet
as
you
were
i
want
to
borrow
one
of
your
young
gentlemen
for
the
day
major
a
vip
is
in
town
and
we
want
to
give
him
an
aide
he
looked
about
the
room
as
though
to
pick
out
a
candidate
how
about
cadet
hanlon
does
he
especially
need
today
lesson
oh
no
sir
he
one
of
our
top
students
admiral
rogers
looked
directly
at
hanlon
who
had
risen
to
attention
when
his
name
was
mentioned
in
my
office
in
full
dress
uniform
on
the
double
dismiss
hanlon
the
instructor
said
and
the
cadet
ran
out
in
admiral
rogers
office
ten
minutes
later
hanlon
received
his
instructions
report
to
the
simonidean
embassy
and
put
yourself
at
the
disposal
of
hector
abrams
first
secretary
to
the
simonidean
prime
minister
but
first
hang
this
stuff
on
you
this
dress
sword
is
a
little
unusual
the
scabbard
is
rounder
than
yours
but
not
noticeably
so
it
really
a
blaster
the
trigger
is
here
on
the
handle
as
you
grasp
it
put
on
these
aide
aguillettes
the
metal
tips
are
police
whistles
no
seeing
hanlon
questioning
look
we
do
expect
any
trouble
today
these
are
just
routine
for
we
like
to
be
ready
for
emergencies
hanlon
fastened
the
braided
cords
to
his
shoulder
tabs
and
belted
on
the
the
admiral
touched
a
switch
on
his
desk
and
spoke
into
a
microphone
my
personal
car
to
take
cadet
hanlon
to
the
simonidean
embassy
then
return
at
the
embassy
hanlon
reported
to
the
receptionist
and
was
shown
with
due
deference
into
one
of
the
private
offices
where
he
was
introduced
to
several
men
among
them
the
secretary
he
was
to
accompany
i
have
a
number
of
errands
to
do
today
but
the
first
and
most
important
is
laying
the
cornerstone
of
our
new
embassy
building
this
one
is
merely
rented
you
may
know
i
am
entirely
at
your
disposal
sir
hanlon
saluted
crisply
and
fell
into
step
just
behind
the
portly
statesman
as
he
left
the
building
they
rode
in
an
open
car
with
a
uniformed
chauffeur
the
others
following
in
other
cars
as
they
rode
hanlon
probed
the
mind
but
found
only
that
he
shrewdly
guessed
had
to
do
with
the
coming
speech
rather
than
with
any
thought
of
intrigue
or
illegal
machination
as
they
came
into
the
greek
section
of
the
city
their
ride
took
on
more
and
more
the
aspects
of
a
parade
as
the
simonidean
was
recognized
hanlon
opened
his
mind
wide
and
attempted
to
analyze
the
he
received
from
the
crowds
it
was
one
of
gaiety
and
good
nature
and
reminded
him
of
the
way
his
boyish
mind
interpreted
the
thoughts
of
holiday
crowds
at
the
circus
fourth
of
july
celebrations
picnics
and
so
on
from
the
moment
he
first
entered
the
embassy
hanlon
had
been
probing
with
every
iota
of
his
ability
hoping
he
could
find
some
lead
to
whatever
it
was
that
was
bothering
the
corps
about
simonides
but
had
found
nothing
sinister
or
menacing
nor
could
he
get
any
such
sensations
from
the
crowd
but
now
he
concentrated
more
on
watching
the
increasingly
denser
throng
of
people
for
the
car
was
nearing
their
destination
the
buildings
along
here
were
all
bedecked
with
simonidean
and
flags
and
there
was
now
a
continuous
cheering
from
the
populace
abrams
was
standing
in
the
back
of
the
car
now
smilingly
acknowledging
their
plaudits
by
bowing
to
one
side
and
the
other
hanlon
sitting
stiffly
at
attention
nevertheless
kept
his
eyes
darting
here
and
there
watching
as
carefully
as
he
could
for
any
possible
hostile
demonstrations
or
menacing
figures
arrived
at
the
building
site
abrams
was
greeted
by
numerous
dignitaries
and
escorted
with
much
pomp
to
the
stand
amid
greater
cheering
from
the
assembled
crowd
the
chairman
of
the
occasion
stepped
to
the
microphone
and
raised
his
hands
for
silence
the
band
broke
off
in
the
middle
of
a
number
the
cheering
from
the
huge
throng
gradually
died
down
and
the
ceremony
got
under
way
hanlon
who
had
taken
his
post
at
one
corner
of
the
platform
paid
scant
attention
to
what
was
happening
on
it
as
it
neither
interested
him
nor
could
he
understand
too
much
of
it
even
though
he
knew
quite
a
bit
of
greek
again
his
eyes
were
busy
continually
looking
all
about
the
great
crowd
and
the
surroundings
nothing
of
note
occurred
until
the
chairman
began
introducing
abrams
and
then
hecklers
in
the
crowd
began
shouting
freedom
for
the
greeks
of
simonides
empires
are
out
of
date
let
the
people
rule
demos
forever
these
calls
were
few
at
first
but
the
men
yelling
them
were
the
chairman
face
turned
reddish
and
he
wavered
a
bit
in
his
speech
then
raised
his
own
voice
in
an
attempt
to
drown
out
the
interruptions
others
were
now
crying
out
though
still
only
a
few
but
in
spite
of
their
shouts
the
ceremonies
continued
and
abrams
properly
introduced
rose
and
began
his
prepared
speech
hanlon
more
alert
than
ever
could
see
local
police
shoving
through
the
crowd
trying
to
apprehend
and
silence
the
hecklers
but
from
his
vantage
point
hanlon
saw
the
latter
shifting
rapidly
from
place
to
place
partly
to
escape
detection
he
swiftly
deduced
and
partly
to
make
it
seem
as
though
more
and
more
people
were
joining
in
the
demonstration
in
a
side
glance
hanlon
saw
that
the
secretary
was
nettled
at
the
disturbance
and
his
color
was
high
although
he
bravely
continued
speaking
the
great
audience
was
largely
paying
attention
to
him
and
must
have
found
him
interesting
from
their
frequent
cheers
suddenly
at
one
side
there
seemed
to
be
a
more
determined
demonstration
and
hanlon
tore
his
gaze
from
it
remembering
his
instructor
words
disregard
specific
diversions
in
one
spot
let
the
police
handle
those
you
must
watch
most
carefully
then
for
assassins
instantly
he
was
more
alert
more
carefully
scanning
the
whole
scene
before
him
his
eyes
travelling
forth
and
back
a
glint
of
reflected
sunlight
from
a
nearby
roof
jerked
his
eyes
upward
and
at
what
he
saw
with
one
swift
smooth
motion
he
drew
his
sighted
carefully
and
pressed
the
trigger
there
was
a
crack
of
flame
and
a
gunman
behind
a
chimney
screamed
then
his
body
charred
by
the
force
of
that
blast
toppled
from
the
roof
into
the
street
below
his
rifle
falling
near
him
hanlon
swivelled
cover
abrams
his
voice
rang
out
commandingly
and
he
himself
jumped
in
front
of
the
secretary
while
others
on
the
platform
sprang
up
to
completely
surround
the
simonidean
and
hide
him
from
possible
further
danger
hanlon
raised
one
of
the
and
blew
a
piercing
blast
now
he
could
see
several
local
policemen
running
toward
the
platform
and
in
moments
abrams
surrounded
by
an
armed
and
alert
escort
was
hustled
into
a
waiting
police
car
which
sped
back
to
the
embassy
the
simonidean
was
white
and
shaking
upset
by
the
episode
why
he
kept
asking
but
no
one
had
any
answers
i
not
important
enough
for
anyone
to
want
to
kill
abrams
shook
his
head
the
people
of
simonides
like
the
empire
status
why
should
anyone
here
on
terra
object
there
always
crackpots
in
every
crowd
a
police
captain
said
we
get
riots
like
this
one
almost
every
time
there
a
public
ceremony
most
of
plain
nuts
once
in
a
while
only
is
there
one
who
feels
he
got
a
real
grievance
personal
but
with
so
many
participating
this
one
looked
planned
hanlon
objected
i
was
higher
and
watching
and
i
could
see
at
least
a
dozen
men
shouting
at
the
beginning
starting
all
at
the
same
time
although
a
lot
more
took
it
up
it
must
have
been
a
plot
of
some
kind
his
mind
was
racing
was
this
part
of
what
he
was
being
sent
to
simonides
to
investigate
he
had
tried
to
probe
the
crowd
minds
but
there
were
so
many
conflicting
such
a
welter
of
sensations
he
was
able
to
isolate
any
single
individual
moods
or
thoughts
safely
back
inside
the
embassy
abrams
seemed
to
relax
a
bit
he
turned
now
to
hanlon
my
very
sincere
thanks
young
man
for
your
quickness
and
alertness
in
saving
my
life
i
shall
be
eternally
grateful
hanlon
waved
his
hand
deprecatingly
it
was
my
job
sir
i
sorry
your
day
was
spoiled
that
way
i
still
ca
make
out
why
the
simonidean
said
slowly
and
hanlon
probing
could
sense
that
his
mind
was
full
of
question
marks
i
not
that
important
if
it
had
been
the
emperor
hanlon
caught
an
impression
of
loyalty
and
love
for
that
dignitary
or
even
the
minister
here
he
caught
a
feeling
of
doubt
and
some
dislike
it
might
make
sense
just
as
i
can
not
figure
out
why
i
should
have
been
sent
here
for
this
purpose
it
almost
he
was
silent
and
hanlon
probes
found
only
puzzlement
nuts
the
young
corpsman
felt
frustrated
if
only
i
could
really
read
minds
i
think
this
guy
knows
something
i
want
to
learn
but
i
ca
get
the
least
idea
of
what
it
is
but
he
kept
trying
and
not
only
with
the
mind
of
this
one
man
he
had
been
sent
here
to
guard
he
reached
out
to
all
other
minds
in
the
room
but
none
of
them
seemed
to
have
any
thoughts
about
the
why
of
this
unexpected
happenstance
there
were
mostly
feelings
of
anger
that
their
beautiful
new
embassy
building
had
not
been
properly
dedicated
and
their
ceremony
ruined
abrams
had
sunk
into
a
chair
and
it
soon
became
apparent
to
hanlon
that
he
was
planning
on
handling
any
of
his
other
outside
errands
that
day
will
you
want
me
any
more
sir
he
finally
asked
after
a
considerable
period
of
uneasy
fidgetting
the
simonidean
broke
out
of
his
abstraction
and
rose
to
his
feet
no
i
shall
stay
here
for
the
balance
of
the
day
at
least
you
may
as
well
return
to
your
other
duties
again
thank
you
personally
for
saving
my
life
and
please
express
my
thanks
to
the
corps
for
sending
you
but
i
still
ca
understand
he
turned
away
muttering
hanlon
saluted
the
other
members
of
the
embassy
staff
and
rode
the
slideways
back
to
base
reporting
to
admiral
rogers
to
whom
he
gave
a
full
and
concise
account
of
all
that
had
happened
whatever
abrams
and
the
police
may
think
i
still
believe
it
was
all
carefully
planned
he
concluded
thoughtfully
it
was
just
one
man
for
i
could
see
at
least
a
dozen
though
of
course
he
added
quickly
one
man
may
have
been
behind
it
undoubtedly
the
admiral
said
there
was
the
chance
of
something
like
this
which
is
why
i
picked
you
for
the
job
hoping
you
could
get
some
leads
from
it
i
told
you
i
could
read
specific
thoughts
or
information
hanlon
said
if
you
and
the
top
brass
picked
me
for
the
ss
because
you
thought
i
could
you
better
release
me
from
it
i
ca
work
in
a
crowd
at
all
for
there
such
a
jumble
of
i
ca
separate
them
even
working
with
an
individual
i
can
only
sense
something
of
his
feelings
just
as
now
he
grinned
mirthlessly
you
disappointed
because
i
did
get
any
data
and
thinking
my
is
all
a
fake
the
admiral
almost
jumped
why
i
am
not
then
he
looked
surprised
and
laughed
by
snyder
i
was
too
he
sobered
but
if
you
can
do
that
even
if
you
ca
actually
read
the
words
of
the
thought
you
still
be
able
to
help
i
sure
no
you
keep
on
studying
bet
you
be
able
to
do
a
lot
more
before
long
i
sure
hope
so
hanlon
slowly
unfastened
the
aiguellettes
and
removed
the
sword
and
belt
laying
them
on
the
corner
of
the
big
desk
at
touch
of
that
weapon
he
suddenly
realized
what
he
had
done
with
it
and
shuddered
while
his
face
grew
white
and
strained
what
the
matter
the
admiral
asked
anxiously
i
killed
a
man
hanlon
trembled
no
you
killed
a
snake
admiral
rogers
laid
his
arm
comfortingly
about
the
younger
man
shoulders
it
is
the
same
at
all
do
let
it
bother
you
hanlon
tried
manfully
to
rise
from
his
dark
mood
you
right
in
a
way
sir
and
i
try
to
look
at
it
that
way
as
to
the
i
keep
on
trying
and
i
hope
i
can
prove
of
some
use
the
admiral
patted
his
shoulder
encouragingly
you
will
dismiss
chapter
the
cadets
were
all
keyed
up
about
graduation
now
so
near
and
most
of
them
were
cramming
at
every
opportunity
on
the
subjects
in
which
they
felt
themselves
deficient
such
tenseness
is
natural
before
any
final
examinations
but
in
their
case
more
so
than
it
would
have
been
in
an
ordinary
school
or
university
for
not
until
the
final
marks
were
posted
from
these
last
examinations
plus
their
marks
for
the
entire
five
years
would
any
of
them
except
hanlon
of
course
know
for
a
surety
that
he
would
be
graduated
and
become
a
permanent
member
of
the
corps
and
how
intensely
each
of
them
wanted
to
belong
four
days
had
now
passed
since
george
hanlon
fateful
interview
with
the
commandant
of
cadets
and
its
unexpected
outcome
he
could
hardly
believe
even
yet
that
he
was
now
actually
a
member
of
the
unknown
secret
service
of
the
corps
only
the
great
inner
joy
he
knew
at
the
recovery
of
his
dad
and
the
complete
dismissal
of
all
those
black
hatreds
gave
proof
that
it
was
all
a
fantastic
dream
hanlon
had
experienced
anything
unusual
in
the
cadet
routine
and
was
growing
more
and
more
nervous
as
to
just
what
was
to
happen
to
him
he
still
shivered
every
time
he
thought
of
that
coming
dreaded
ordeal
and
all
this
waiting
this
worrying
this
wondering
when
it
was
making
life
any
easier
if
only
they
would
get
it
over
and
done
with
but
he
strove
to
compose
himself
for
it
as
best
he
could
and
it
was
a
measure
of
his
inherent
stability
that
he
never
let
his
comrades
even
his
roommate
see
how
apprehensive
he
was
now
the
day
had
come
for
the
first
of
their
finals
hanlon
never
worried
about
exams
for
he
had
always
been
near
the
top
of
his
class
now
especially
since
he
was
already
graduated
and
a
senior
lieutenant
he
could
have
taken
things
easily
but
pride
in
his
scholarship
made
him
anxious
as
always
to
do
his
best
their
first
examination
was
history
one
of
hanlon
pet
subjects
for
he
loved
this
story
of
mankind
his
ups
and
downs
and
gradual
growth
when
the
examination
papers
were
handed
out
and
he
noted
the
first
question
he
smiled
if
only
they
were
all
that
easy
give
briefly
a
resume
of
the
events
leading
up
to
the
formation
of
the
corps
hanlon
uncapped
his
writo
and
began
in
the
middle
of
the
twentieth
century
the
various
governments
of
earth
were
all
tending
toward
either
a
totalitarian
or
a
state
more
and
more
power
became
vested
in
the
executive
branch
more
and
more
citizens
were
either
working
directly
for
government
or
were
supported
by
relief
funds
business
was
to
an
increasingly
greater
extent
stifled
by
public
debts
became
a
staggering
load
and
workers
had
less
and
less
of
their
income
available
for
living
needs
when
atomic
energy
was
first
released
by
the
united
states
in
the
form
of
a
bomb
during
a
war
the
military
took
complete
control
of
it
neither
private
nor
industrial
scientists
or
technicians
were
allowed
to
experiment
with
possibilities
of
getting
power
directly
from
atomic
fission
in
a
young
man
named
travis
burkett
was
elected
to
the
united
states
congress
from
california
during
his
four
terms
as
member
of
the
lower
house
he
became
increasingly
as
possessor
of
one
of
the
finest
minds
in
public
life
in
he
was
advanced
to
the
senate
and
soon
became
its
leading
member
in
prophetic
year
he
ran
for
president
on
the
simple
platform
of
the
country
back
to
the
people
his
ideas
and
views
so
fired
the
minds
and
hopes
of
the
citizens
of
america
regimented
and
ground
down
by
the
cancerous
growth
of
bureaucracy
that
even
most
of
the
bureaucrats
and
reliefers
joined
to
elect
him
by
one
of
the
greatest
pluralities
ever
polled
during
his
two
terms
of
office
with
the
help
of
a
cabinet
of
men
who
believed
as
he
did
he
fulfilled
his
promises
the
tremendous
power
of
the
executive
was
gradually
returned
to
the
legislative
where
it
belonged
unnecessary
and
duplicated
bureaus
and
agencies
were
reduced
to
the
minimum
only
persons
actually
in
need
were
supported
from
the
public
purse
where
almost
of
the
citizenry
had
been
working
for
or
supported
by
government
when
he
took
office
less
than
were
doing
so
when
he
retired
tax
restrictions
and
governmental
meddling
in
industry
and
business
were
reduced
save
for
a
few
necessary
of
and
laws
with
these
restrictions
removed
and
with
control
of
so
many
vital
sciences
and
technologies
taken
away
from
the
military
inventions
took
an
accelerated
the
peoples
of
other
countries
fired
by
the
realization
of
what
could
be
done
staged
revolutions
happily
largely
bloodless
and
soon
working
through
the
united
nations
council
a
united
world
government
became
an
actuality
and
burkett
one
of
its
first
presidents
an
american
named
john
snyder
had
years
before
secretly
worked
out
a
simple
and
inexpensive
method
of
obtaining
practically
unlimited
power
directly
from
atomic
fission
now
he
could
legally
bring
this
to
the
public
and
soon
homes
public
transportation
and
industry
were
using
his
power
method
snyder
attracted
to
him
a
group
of
gifted
scientists
and
technicians
these
now
turned
their
attention
to
space
flight
and
man
the
insatiable
began
stretching
out
greedy
hands
to
the
stars
they
put
a
robot
rocket
on
the
moon
in
less
than
two
years
their
third
rocket
carried
two
scientists
who
did
not
make
the
return
trip
they
stayed
to
study
and
to
learn
five
years
later
the
first
ship
landed
on
mars
and
within
a
decade
that
planet
was
largely
colonized
so
two
years
later
was
venus
another
fifteen
years
saw
colonization
of
most
of
the
moons
of
the
outer
planets
for
using
new
techniques
and
inventions
learned
from
many
experiments
the
moons
and
planets
were
given
air
water
and
warmth
as
needed
android
robots
developed
by
varney
one
of
snyder
scientists
helped
greatly
in
this
work
especially
one
young
female
android
who
was
a
true
genius
then
man
reached
the
stars
and
the
planets
of
those
distant
suns
it
was
here
that
the
snyder
proved
himself
again
one
of
the
greatest
humanitarians
ever
to
have
lived
he
promulgated
the
ruling
that
is
still
in
force
must
never
colonize
any
planet
having
inhabitants
intelligent
enough
to
show
cultural
activity
and
controlling
all
means
of
transportation
between
planets
as
he
did
because
he
held
all
the
basic
patents
snyder
was
able
to
enforce
that
ruling
to
do
so
he
organized
the
patrol
which
later
was
taken
over
by
the
federated
planets
when
that
organization
was
formed
and
became
today
corps
today
there
are
planets
colonized
by
former
inhabitants
of
tellus
or
their
descendants
from
colonized
planets
these
each
have
their
own
sovereignty
and
chosen
form
of
government
but
are
united
in
a
federation
which
is
solely
a
court
of
arbitration
for
affairs
the
c
is
the
federation
investigation
and
enforcement
branch
not
a
governing
or
military
patrol
hanlon
had
finished
that
question
and
the
second
which
asked
for
the
dates
of
the
war
between
the
colonists
of
mars
and
those
of
the
jovian
satellites
he
was
resting
his
eyes
by
glancing
unseeingly
about
the
room
momentarily
before
starting
the
third
question
when
he
heard
the
loud
angry
voice
of
the
instructor
in
charge
cadet
hanlon
on
your
feet
sir
just
how
mister
do
you
think
you
can
get
away
with
cheating
at
a
final
examination
hanlon
head
jerked
up
and
his
face
went
as
the
blood
drained
from
it
he
stumbled
to
his
feet
and
conscious
of
the
amazed
expressions
of
his
classmates
looked
up
at
the
teacher
bu
but
i
do
understand
sir
i
was
cheating
do
lie
to
me
the
voice
was
a
whiplash
i
distinctly
saw
you
looking
at
cadet
fox
paper
the
idea
of
any
cadet
this
close
to
graduation
trying
such
a
contemptible
thing
hanlon
bewilderment
was
changing
to
anger
at
such
an
unjust
accusation
when
suddenly
a
thought
struck
him
was
it
cheating
at
examinations
always
meant
expulsion
and
disgrace
he
had
all
he
could
do
to
keep
from
betraying
himself
as
he
probed
quickly
toward
the
mind
on
the
rostrum
now
he
perceived
the
feeling
of
commiseration
which
the
stern
hot
eyes
of
the
apparently
outraged
instructor
did
not
reveal
hanlon
remembered
his
father
instructions
to
play
it
up
big
he
made
himself
glare
back
at
the
teacher
and
his
blue
eyes
took
on
the
hardness
of
glacial
ice
you
making
a
colossal
mistake
sir
his
voice
was
louder
and
angrier
than
it
should
ever
have
been
if
our
regular
instructor
was
giving
this
exam
he
never
make
such
an
accusation
i
led
this
class
in
grades
all
through
school
and
not
by
cheating
either
lower
your
voice
mister
and
do
talk
back
but
was
receiving
approbation
now
i
saw
you
cheating
and
i
know
what
i
saw
do
you
want
to
resign
or
will
you
force
me
to
take
you
to
the
commandant
i
do
know
who
you
are
but
you
a
stupid
fool
hanlon
apparently
lost
all
control
of
himself
and
his
voice
and
red
face
showed
the
anger
he
was
simulating
so
well
if
you
think
you
going
to
frame
me
out
of
this
class
and
out
of
graduating
you
a
confounded
idiot
ask
any
of
these
chaps
here
they
all
know
i
not
a
cheat
but
the
cadets
though
puzzled
and
dismayed
were
far
too
clever
to
get
mixed
up
in
this
unexpected
brawl
they
all
sat
eyes
lowered
but
faces
straight
ahead
arms
folded
across
their
chests
having
no
part
in
it
at
all
the
examining
instructor
a
man
much
larger
and
heavier
than
five
feet
eleven
inches
and
one
hundred
and
pounds
rushed
down
from
the
platform
he
grabbed
at
the
cadet
arms
but
hanlon
swivelled
away
then
stepped
back
in
and
struck
at
the
officer
that
was
mutiny
it
was
unthinkable
for
a
cadet
to
strike
an
officer
under
any
circumstances
or
provocation
the
teacher
however
snared
the
cadet
in
a
hold
that
no
neophyte
however
skilled
or
strong
could
break
he
dragged
the
struggling
hanlon
up
to
the
rostrum
and
with
his
elbow
activated
the
intercom
ask
the
commandant
to
come
to
room
a
cadet
caught
cheating
at
examinations
has
mutinied
still
holding
the
struggling
angry
hanlon
the
excoriated
his
victim
for
such
breach
of
cadet
honor
hanlon
meanwhile
yelled
insults
and
oaths
he
twisted
and
squirmed
as
though
trying
to
escape
although
he
had
quickly
realized
he
was
now
being
held
in
a
loose
though
grip
he
could
have
broken
easily
had
he
so
desired
yet
during
all
this
hanlon
was
receiving
from
the
officer
mind
the
distinct
impression
that
the
latter
hated
what
he
was
doing
yet
was
approving
the
way
the
new
ss
man
was
playing
his
part
further
hanlon
sensed
he
was
being
welcomed
into
the
fellowship
of
those
unknown
ss
men
to
whom
he
was
now
brother
soon
admiral
rogers
followed
by
two
hulking
space
marines
came
running
into
the
room
what
going
on
here
he
barked
quickly
the
teacher
repeated
his
charges
while
hanlon
yelled
denials
and
vituperations
at
the
moronic
imbecile
who
dared
accuse
him
of
such
treachery
i
ashamed
of
you
hanlon
the
admiral
said
coldly
we
had
high
hopes
for
you
as
i
told
you
when
i
interviewed
you
about
your
initial
assignment
then
why
do
you
listen
to
me
instead
of
taking
the
word
of
this
who
calls
himself
an
instructor
bah
he
oughta
be
digging
ditches
that
do
disgust
showed
on
the
admiral
face
as
he
gestured
to
the
marines
who
jumped
forward
and
grabbed
hanlon
arms
twisting
them
behind
his
back
and
handcuffing
them
george
hanlon
you
are
hereby
officially
dismissed
from
the
corps
cadet
school
so
saying
admiral
rogers
ripped
all
identifying
symbols
from
uniform
then
turned
again
to
the
marines
take
him
outside
the
reservation
they
hauled
hanlon
still
shrieking
and
cursing
out
of
the
room
out
of
the
building
across
the
park
and
to
the
gate
of
the
corps
property
there
his
handcuffs
were
removed
and
the
sneering
marines
literally
and
booted
him
into
the
street
where
he
sprawled
face
downward
in
a
muddy
puddle
hanlon
pulled
himself
erect
apparently
mad
clear
through
he
shook
his
fist
at
the
grinning
marines
gathered
just
inside
the
gate
he
cursed
them
fluently
with
every
foul
oath
and
name
he
could
remember
ever
having
heard
innately
clean
of
speech
and
thought
this
swearing
nearly
gagged
him
but
he
was
putting
on
a
good
act
they
stood
his
insults
for
some
time
but
when
he
began
to
get
too
personal
a
couple
of
them
started
toward
him
their
mocking
laughter
gone
to
make
his
act
better
hanlon
now
pretended
to
be
frightened
cowardly
and
accompanied
by
the
jeers
of
the
civilian
who
had
quickly
congregated
to
see
what
all
the
rumpus
was
about
he
fled
down
the
city
street
away
from
the
reservation
at
first
opportunity
after
he
had
outdistanced
his
pursuers
hanlon
ducked
into
an
alley
he
ran
down
this
until
he
spotted
the
back
door
of
a
little
cafe
and
dodged
inside
there
in
the
washroom
he
cleaned
himself
as
best
he
could
again
somewhat
presentable
he
left
by
the
front
door
and
rode
the
slideways
to
a
section
of
the
city
where
he
could
buy
some
good
but
not
too
expensive
clothing
now
inconspicuously
dressed
he
got
a
hotel
room
then
went
to
the
bank
where
he
bought
some
shares
of
stock
arranged
for
insurance
and
rented
a
deposit
box
chapter
in
the
hotel
room
assigned
him
george
hanlon
threw
himself
on
the
bed
and
for
an
hour
lay
there
reviewing
this
sudden
strange
turn
of
events
and
all
it
presaged
he
tried
in
vain
to
thrust
out
of
his
mind
the
astonished
consternation
of
his
classmates
the
sneers
of
the
marines
and
the
jeers
of
the
civilians
there
at
the
gate
who
had
seen
his
disgrace
almost
in
tears
now
he
realized
at
last
this
was
but
a
prelude
to
years
of
being
scorned
and
vilified
as
a
despised
outcast
finally
he
calmed
a
bit
then
got
up
to
pace
the
room
wondering
what
the
next
move
would
be
the
answer
came
almost
at
once
a
rap
on
the
door
disclosed
a
messenger
with
a
package
for
him
on
opening
it
after
the
man
had
gone
hanlon
found
the
and
reels
on
top
was
a
smaller
reel
marked
no
listen
to
this
awake
he
plugged
in
the
machine
and
put
on
the
reel
it
was
his
voice
you
got
this
far
now
begins
your
real
work
you
should
be
able
to
memorize
the
contents
of
these
reels
in
two
weeks
briefly
here
is
what
they
contain
simonides
four
was
colonized
under
the
direction
of
a
greek
merchant
who
gave
it
his
name
four
is
the
only
habitable
planet
most
of
the
original
inhabitants
under
him
were
of
his
nationality
and
the
present
language
is
an
outgrowth
of
modern
greek
which
you
know
somewhat
there
are
now
of
course
many
variations
and
new
words
terms
peculiar
to
their
growing
and
evolving
culture
the
reels
give
all
this
more
fully
the
last
reel
tells
their
history
geography
and
economic
situation
as
of
today
also
details
about
their
various
large
cities
especially
new
athens
their
capitol
we
believe
you
will
find
that
city
the
best
place
to
start
your
investigations
when
you
have
these
reels
memorized
go
to
the
bank
get
your
final
instructions
from
the
box
and
your
money
for
the
trip
as
to
the
problem
again
briefly
this
is
it
in
the
past
year
or
so
federation
agents
have
sensed
a
movement
there
but
have
not
been
able
to
interpret
it
whatever
it
is
it
is
very
very
secret
the
agents
ca
even
tell
if
it
is
political
religious
or
merely
social
also
they
have
discovered
that
many
important
men
as
well
as
dozens
maybe
hundreds
of
less
important
men
have
mysteriously
disappeared
all
this
has
the
smell
of
trouble
for
the
federation
at
last
the
secret
service
was
called
in
we
sent
first
one
man
then
a
second
they
tried
to
from
within
by
joining
whatever
the
movement
was
but
they
have
been
able
to
get
even
a
start
hit
it
and
bounced
the
second
is
still
there
still
trying
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
have
no
evidence
at
all
merely
a
sort
of
or
presentiment
of
a
plot
against
the
peace
and
welfare
of
the
federated
planets
there
may
be
nothing
wrong
at
all
but
we
do
like
to
take
chances
with
your
ability
to
read
minds
you
may
be
able
to
find
out
we
hope
so
hanlon
thought
the
message
was
ended
but
then
the
voice
began
again
i
was
told
you
came
through
your
very
well
i
know
just
what
you
are
undoubtedly
feeling
at
the
moment
spence
how
sick
at
heart
you
are
and
i
only
wish
there
was
some
way
of
easing
your
pain
but
it
will
pass
good
luck
son
and
safe
flights
take
care
of
yourself
we
all
behind
you
and
by
the
devious
ways
you
know
you
can
call
on
any
or
all
of
us
at
need
these
reels
are
all
water
soluble
so
dissolve
them
in
the
washbowl
and
flush
down
the
drain
as
soon
as
you
through
with
each
for
the
next
two
weeks
hanlon
stayed
fairly
close
to
his
room
studying
by
day
from
books
obtained
at
the
library
the
things
he
was
learning
at
night
via
the
the
evening
of
graduation
day
he
sat
miserably
in
front
of
a
video
screen
in
his
room
watching
the
broadcast
of
the
stately
ceremony
of
which
he
would
have
been
a
part
but
for
his
decision
to
join
the
secret
service
all
the
longings
of
the
years
he
had
wanted
to
become
a
part
of
the
corps
all
the
hopes
and
plans
he
had
made
during
his
five
long
years
in
cadet
school
all
the
thrilling
pride
he
had
known
that
he
was
to
be
a
part
of
the
greatest
organization
in
the
universe
swelled
inside
him
and
choked
him
when
at
long
last
the
class
rose
to
take
the
oath
of
allegiance
hanlon
found
himself
on
his
feet
rigidly
at
attention
repeating
the
impressive
ritual
aloud
with
them
now
for
the
first
time
despite
his
decision
and
his
private
graduation
he
truly
felt
himself
a
vital
part
of
the
corps
on
the
street
on
his
way
to
the
library
the
following
day
hanlon
chanced
to
meet
a
small
group
of
his
former
classmates
now
clad
in
their
dress

their
new

bars
shining
brightly
hi
fellows
he
greeted
them
only
to
be
met
by
silent
glares
of
contempt
aw
look
fellows
you
know
i
was
framed
hanlon
planted
himself
in
front
of
them
and
made
himself
look
hurt
nor
was
that
any
effort
this
really
cut
deep
but
he
had
to
play
it
out
had
to
make
them
keep
on
thinking
his
disgrace
was
real
you
guys
know
i
never
do
anything
like
that
he
continued
plaintively
i
did
cheat
did
need
to
i
know
i
lost
my
head
when
he
accused
me
but
anyone
do
that
you
mean
you
were
never
caught
cheating
before
trowbridge
sneered
you
sure
had
me
us
all
fooled
now
scram
or
else
he
doubled
his
fists
and
took
a
step
toward
hanlon
the
latter
still
played
out
his
string
but
his
heart
was
sick
he
liked
the
fellows
they
had
been
among
his
best
friends
for
five
long
happy
years
only
now
was
he
truly
beginning
to
realize
what
a
tremendous
price
he
was
paying
and
would
have
to
pay
all
his
life
he
stepped
in
and
swung
and
was
instantly
the
target
for
flying
fists
he
was
knocked
down
several
times
but
always
managed
to
get
up
again
he
had
been
well
trained
in
fighting
of
all
types
and
now
he
was
putting
all
his
knowledge
and
skill
into
use
but
only
for
defense
and
the
pretense
of
attack
even
so
he
was
getting
badly
mauled
for
they
were
as
well
trained
and
were
five
to
his
one
his
clothes
were
dirty
and
ripped
from
the
and
a
button
was
torn
off
his
coat
his
knuckles
were
skinned
and
he
could
feel
that
his
face
was
becoming
a
mass
of
bruises
a
hard
left
connected
with
his
mouth
and
he
spat
out
a
broken
tooth
a
commanding
voice
suddenly
broke
in
instantly
the
five
corpsmen
jumped
back
and
so
ingrained
was
the
training
he
had
received
so
did
hanlon
to
come
at
salute
as
they
saw
a
high
admiral
climbing
out
of
a
at
the
curb
hanlon
instantly
realizing
he
was
in
uniform
and
was
supposedly
a
discharged
corpsman
quickly
dropped
his
salute
and
slouched
truculently
what
going
on
here
the
officer
asked
icily
this
man
a
disgraced
cadet
sir
cheated
on
final
exams
one
of
them
explained
he
tried
to
talk
to
us
it
a
lousy
lie
hanlon
rasped
i
was
framed
the
corps
paugh
he
spat
in
pretend
disgust
i
getting
out
of
here
just
as
damned
quick
as
i
can
and
as
far
as
i
can
i
go
clear
to
andromeda
seven
if
i
can
raise
enough
credits
only
he
apparently
saw
the
minute
widening
of
the
admiral
eyes
at
that
the
officer
faced
the
new
lieutenants
sternly
a
corpsman
is
supposed
to
be
able
to
handle
five
civilians
not
five
corpsmen
to
one
if
this
man
is
a
disgraced
cadet
you
have
a
right
to
feel
as
you
do
about
him
but
leave
him
alone
the
years
will
bring
him
more
sorrow
and
pain
than
you
can
with
your
fists
and
you
fellow
turning
to
hanlon
do
think
i
interfering
just
to
save
your
worthless
skin
his
tone
was
one
of
utmost
contempt
i
just
do
want
corpsmen
fighting
on
the
street
dismiss
the
five
saluted
smartly
and
marched
away
the
admiral
winked
briefly
and
with
respect
at
hanlon
before
reentering
his
cab
but
as
the
young
man
hurried
back
to
his
hotel
to
clean
up
he
was
heartsick
remembering
the
many
many
months
of
pleasant
companionship
with
those
boys
especially
dick
trowbridge
who
had
been
his
roommate
and
special
chum
all
through
cadet
school
and
who
today
had
seemed
particularly
disgusted
and
vicious
in
that
fight
giving
up
all
that
had
made
life
so
happy
and
wonderful
was
more
than
a
fellow
could
bear
his
bitter
thoughts
ran
what
a
fool
he
had
been
to
let
himself
be
talked
into
taking
this
on
where
were
all
those
vast
rewards
his
dad
and
admiral
rogers
had
talked
about
so
eloquently
how
could
anything
possibly
make
up
for
losing
the
respect
and
friendship
of
everyone
he
had
ever
known
however
he
had
to
admit
though
still
doubtfully
dad
had
gone
through
it
even
to
the
point
of
giving
up
his
son
and
those
last
few
weeks
with
his
adored
wife
yet
now
seemed
satisfied
and
content
maybe
maybe
there
was
something
behind
it
all
that
time
would
prove
but
it
was
mighty
hard
to
take
just
the
same
and
this
throbbing
toothache
did
help
his
feelings
any
either
the
exposed
nerve
in
that
broken
tooth
made
it
ache
like
blazes
he
better
get
it
fixed
before
it
drove
him
mad
he
started
to
go
out
then
stopped
with
the
realization
he
had
no
money
of
his
own
to
pay
a
dentist
for
the
extraction
and
a
bridge
what
do
i
do
in
a
case
like
this
he
wondered
is
it
ethical
in
such
a
purely
personal
matter
to
use
corps
funds
dad
did
mention
things
of
this
sort
on
the
other
hand
he
said
we
got
our
salaries
and
expenses
that
way
besides
you
could
say
i
lost
the
tooth
in
line
of
duty
and
the
corps
should
replace
it
he
went
on
found
a
dentist
and
had
the
work
done
nor
did
he
ever
again
feel
doubt
about
spending
the
corps
money
for
things
he
actually
needed
but
neither
did
he
ever
spend
any
on
purely
personal
pleasures
or
extra
comforts
save
as
he
needed
to
do
so
to
play
up
to
whatever
position
he
assumed
in
the
prosecution
of
his
various
assignments
evening
however
found
him
still
with
that
smothered
feeling
of
about
his
fight
with
the
fellows
and
it
persisted
even
after
he
went
to
bed
by
the
shade
of
snyder
it
was
fair
to
saddle
a
thing
like
this
on
a
mere
kid
it
was
until
after
a
couple
of
hours
of
tossing
sleeplessness
that
he
remembered
he
had
turned
on
the
he
nevertheless
got
up
and
did
so
and
that
little
act
broke
his
mood
he
dropped
asleep
almost
immediately
after
returning
to
bed
at
the
end
of
the
two
weeks
hanlon
felt
he
knew
both
the
simonidean
language
and
its
customs
well
enough
to
start
working
he
went
to
the
bank
and
deviously
to
box
sorting
through
a
thick
sheaf
of
envelopes
he
found
one
with
his
name
on
it
he
took
it
to
one
of
the
cubicles
whose
door
he
locked
from
the
inside
setting
up
full
coverage
as
he
read
there
flashed
through
his
mind
the
background
of
this
other
planet
situation
from
his
knowledge
of
within
the
federation
he
knew
there
was
an
agreement
that
each
planet
could
choose
its
own
form
of
government
most
of
them
chose
the
democratic
form
but
some
had
a
type
of
fascistic
state
one
or
two
the
most
advanced
even
had
an
anarchistic
state
with
a
very
minimum
of
laws
and
governing
simonides
had
about
a
century
earlier
reverted
to
the
empire
status
the
only
planet
within
the
federation
to
do
so
it
had
originally
been
colonized
as
a
republic
but
later
had
broken
up
into
five
independent
countries
as
different
sections
became
populated
more
heavily
with
people
of
other
national
backgrounds
than
greek
these
five
countries
had
eventually
been
recombined
after
a
spectacular
coup
as
an
empire
then
had
come
this
belief
of
the
corps
that
something
was
brewing
there
that
would
affect
the
peace
of
the
federation
and
the
failure
of
their
agents
so
far
to
find
out
about
it
now
ssm
hanlon
orders
were
to
take
ship
to
simonides
four
and
seek
to
learn
what
he
could
about
these
conditions
as
swiftly
as
possible
if
he
gained
any
impressions
of
who
or
what
group
was
behind
this
movement
he
was
to
attempt
to
join
it
and
ferret
out
that
secret
so
it
could
be
reported
with
such
information
in
their
possession
the
corps
would
know
if
it
was
anything
inimical
to
the
peace
and
security
of
the
federation
and
would
take
the
necessary
steps
his
instructions
ended
the
cost
of
a
first
class
ticket
to
simonides
is
seven
hundred
and
fifty
credits
so
you
should
draw
enough
to
have
at
least
fifteen
hundred
for
all
needed
expenses
take
the
which
leaves
centropolis
spaceport
friday
of
this
week
we
have
good
reason
to
believe
that
certain
interesting
people
will
be
aboard
that
ship
hanlon
mind
raced
evidently
someone
wanted
him
to
see
what
impressions
or
evidence
he
could
pick
up
from
those
suspected
persons
he
grimaced
as
he
realized
the
ss
had
left
it
strictly
up
to
him
to
discover
who
those
interesting
people
were
perhaps
they
looked
on
it
as
a
sort
of
test
but
he
thrilled
to
the
sudden
awareness
of
what
a
wonderfully
efficient
and
competent
organization
the
ss
was
how
it
kept
careful
watch
on
all
its
members
and
assisted
them
in
every
possible
manner
he
dined
on
the
edible
plastic
sheets
then
left
the
safety
deposit
vault
he
arranged
for
his
ticket
and
reservations
at
the
bank
travel
agency
then
went
back
to
his
hotel
to
pack
chapter
so
it
was
that
early
friday
morning
george
hanlon
still
dressed
in
civvies
of
course
arrived
at
the
great
passenger
liner
that
was
to
take
him
to
far
simonides
he
was
thrilled
with
the
idea
of
making
such
a
trip
for
he
loved
the
deeps
of
space
its
immensity
and
its
fathomless
mystery
gripped
him
with
a
feeling
of
grandeur
yet
he
had
never
been
far
outside
the
solar
system
the
latter
was
not
necessary
on
his
training
cruises
since
all
the
details
of
a
job
the
branch
of
the
service
he
had
hoped
to
enter
were
the
same
for
both
and
travel
it
was
the
job
that
was
the
harder
and
more
complicated
on
the
longer
faster
trips
to
destinations
one
could
not
see
when
blasting
off
this
on
which
he
was
to
ride
was
about
feet
in
diameter
and
approximately
three
times
that
in
length
the
propulsion
was
the
builders
and
engineers
acknowledged
not
the
ultimate
by
any
means
they
were
still
constantly
experimenting
and
hoping
for
much
swifter
travel
still
they
did
pretty
well
they
had
some
measure
of
to
help
lift
the
ship
from
a
planet
about
hanlon
remembered
they
still
had
to
use
rockets
when
near
a
planet
but
these
rockets
were
a
far
cry
from
the
early
crude
ones
with
which
snyder
and
his
men
had
put
first
ships
on
the
moon
and
planets
these
could
deliver
a
thrust
far
more
powerful
than
those
early
ones
for
long
distances
they
used
a
type
of
warping
that
made
the
ship
skip
along
the
lines
of
force
that
permeate
all
space
hanlon
had
never
quite
got
it
firmly
fixed
in
his
mind
just
how
this
was
done
especially
the
technique
of
the
engines
that
made
it
possible
that
was
advanced
stuff
that
the
cadets
were
not
taught
in
their
regular
courses
it
was
post
graduate
work
for
those
who
were
to
become
engineering
masters
as
he
went
up
the
escalator
into
the
ship
hanlon
was
met
at
the
outer
lock
by
a
deck
steward
who
led
him
toward
the
level
where
his
cabin
was
located
this
was
hanlon
first
time
aboard
one
of
these
luxury
liners
how
different
the
rugs
the
magnificently
frescoed
passageway
walls
the
deeply
upholstered
furniture
from
the
utilitarian
plainness
of
the
corps
warships
on
which
he
had
made
his
practice
cruises
as
you
may
know
sir
the
steward
said
as
they
walked
along
there
is
neither
night
nor
day
in
space
but
we
use
terran
time
on
the
ship
and
lights
are
turned
on
and
off
to
conform
to
the
regular
terran
day
breakfast
is
served
from
seven
to
nine
luncheon
from
twelve
to
fourteen
and
dinner
from
eighteen
to
thanks
a
credit
note
changed
from
hand
to
hand
tipping
was
still
in
style
the
obsequious
steward
gave
him
further
directions
for
finding
the
games
and
recreational
rooms
and
other
points
of
interest
aboard
hanlon
unpacked
and
stored
his
luggage
in
the
compact
closets
and
then
having
heard
the
first
and
second
warnings
hastened
to
the
observation
desk
to
watch
the
he
had
barely
reached
it
and
been
strapped
into
the
acceleration
chair
turned
to
face
the
long
narrow
quartzite
port
when
the
sirens
began
screaming
their
third
and
final
warning
the
communicators
blared
all
passengers
and
personnel
strap
in
five
minutes
until
four
minutes
three
two
one
thirty
seconds
fifteen
ten
five
four
three
two
one
blast
dimly
heard
through
the
insulated
hull
was
what
hanlon
knew
to
be
a
tremendous
crescendo
roar
of
sound
and
he
was
pushed
deep
into
the
resilient
of
his
chair
a
constricting
band
seemed
to
be
clamped
on
his
chest
while
at
the
same
time
there
was
a
curious
feeling
that
he
should
weigh
less
but
did
that
was
the
peculiar
sensation
the
combination
of
and
the
thrust
of
the
rockers
always
gave
from
experience
he
knew
how
to
regulate
his
breathing
and
to
let
his
muscles
and
nerves
relax
as
much
as
possible
so
that
for
him
there
was
but
a
brief
moment
of
discomfort
then
he
was
able
to
watch
the
scene
unfolding
before
and
below
him
the
ground
and
that
outward
splash
of
flame
quickly
dropped
away
and
within
minutes
the
scene
expanded
until
he
was
able
to
see
hundreds
of
square
miles
of
city
country
and
ocean
soon
he
could
see
the
distant
mountains
but
gradually
the
scene
assumed
a
dimness
of
detail
that
persisted
until
they
were
far
outside
the
atmosphere
then
the
great
continental
masses
became
visible
as
a
whole
but
without
any
smaller
details
apparent
two
and
a
half
hours
later
they
were
past
the
moon
and
began
building
up
the
tremendous
speed
that
was
to
take
them
across
depths
in
a
matter
of
short
days
and
as
luna
shrank
to
a
small
sphere
behind
them
hanlon
felt
the
acceleration
grow
constant
so
unstrapped
himself
and
got
up
he
stretched
hugely
to
relieve
the
cramped
feeling
in
his
muscles
then
turned
to
survey
his
fellow
passengers
he
noticed
several
men
in
corps
uniform
and
hoped
none
of
them
knew
him
or
if
so
would
be
good
enough
not
to
spread
word
of
his
disgrace
that
would
make
the
trip
uncomfortable
lonely
and
unproductive
for
then
it
would
be
better
for
him
to
spend
most
of
his
time
in
his
stateroom
he
thought
of
those
interesting
people
he
had
been
told
about
whatever
that
tip
might
mean
for
george
hanlon
youngest
man
ever
to
be
assigned
to
the
corps
secret
service
although
he
did
not
know
this
until
later
had
that
within
him
which
placed
matters
of
duty
uppermost
in
his
mind
at
all
times
accustomed
for
nearly
half
of
his
life
to
the
conscious
task
of
keeping
his
talent
hidden
and
unused
he
now
knew
he
must
work
at
it
continuously
to
bring
it
up
to
its
highest
possible
level
of
efficiency
only
by
thus
knowing
every
facet
of
his
ability
could
he
do
what
had
to
be
done
in
his
new
task
he
sat
down
again
and
closed
his
eyes
in
order
better
to
study
this
problem
without
outside
and
extraneous
matters
interfering
he
became
awed
and
a
little
frightened
as
he
realized
fully
the
weight
of
his
new
duties
and
responsibilities
even
though
he
had
been
all
through
this
several
times
before
somehow
his
being
aboard
ship
on
his
way
to
his
actual
work
seemed
to
make
this
terrific
responsibility
more
weighty
why
must
he
be
burdened
with
such
a
load
as
they
had
tied
onto
him
what
were
the
corps
top
brass
thinking
of
anyway
to
put
so
much
on
an
untried
kid
just
out
of
school
at
last
he
began
to
think
less
of
his
own
burden
and
to
concentrate
on
seeing
what
he
could
pick
up
mentally
he
kept
his
eyes
closed
but
opened
his
mind
wide
and
let
the
welter
of
roll
in
unhindered
there
was
much
laughter
and
lighthearted
gaiety
about
him
as
was
natural
on
such
a
luxury
liner
there
was
also
some
fear
of
space
and
the
emptiness
some
actual
illness
from
there
were
many
mental
undercurrents
and
in
one
or
two
instances
he
thought
he
caught
vague
hints
of
sinister
intrigue
but
was
never
quite
able
to
isolate
these
or
to
bring
them
into
more
distinct
focus
quite
evidently
the
men
or
women
thinking
such
thoughts
were
able
to
close
their
minds
to
some
extent
or
else
he
was
too
rusty
at
reading
he
realized
too
that
they
might
not
be
thinking
of
any
such
thing
he
remembered
once
when
he
was
a
boy
he
thought
he
had
caught
some
such
thought
then
found
later
it
was
merely
a
neighbor
reading
a
story
with
a
sinister
plot
he
told
himself
was
the
field
in
which
he
would
be
assigned
to
work
the
corps
and
the
ss
would
be
sure
to
hand
him
all
the
jobs
where
other
agents
had
failed
just
as
they
had
in
this
case
in
hopes
that
he
could
get
them
some
beginning
points
of
contact
so
it
was
up
to
him
to
get
busy
and
learn
how
to
do
it
better
the
call
for
lunch
found
him
still
studying
but
he
was
hungry
and
went
down
to
eat
he
could
work
there
as
well
as
on
the
observation
deck
anyway
going
into
the
dining
room
the
head
waiter
assigned
him
to
a
table
almost
in
the
center
of
the
large
and
tastefully
decorated
room
for
some
moments
he
busied
himself
studying
the
menu
and
when
he
had
ordered
he
glanced
up
again
at
his
tablemates
he
had
been
introduced
to
this
matron
and
to
her
son
who
appeared
to
be
about
his
own
age
he
probed
briefly
finding
her
a
good
sort
but
a
little
too
impressed
with
her
own
importance
he
guessed
the
boy
he
disliked
on
sight
he
seemed
a
selfish
pampered
brat
so
he
forgot
them
and
concentrated
on
letting
his
mind
roam
about
the
great
room
seeking
information
and
trying
to
refine
and
develop
his
ability
it
seemed
to
him
the
latter
was
improving
to
some
extent
yet
realized
this
could
as
easily
be
as
actuality
after
luncheon
he
returned
to
the
observation
deck
and
there
as
the
long
afternoon
slowly
passed
he
sat
in
his
deck
chair
eyes
closed
mind
wide
open
several
times
he
caught
some
one
more
distinctly
than
the
general
run
and
concentrated
on
trying
to
trace
it
mentally
to
read
it
more
clearly
and
minutely
but
as
he
did
not
have
much
success
it
began
to
irritate
him
and
that
made
him
angrier
keep
at
it
and
do
expect
miracles
he
scolded
himself
sure
you
got
something
but
anything
any
ability
of
mind
or
muscle
needs
training
and
practice
to
get
anywhere
after
dinner
that
first
evening
hanlon
went
into
the
recreation
hall
there
were
dozens
of
tables
where
people
were
playing
various
games
he
saw
that
around
many
of
these
other
people
were
standing
watching
the
play
and
knew
from
this
that
social
custom
on
the
ship
did
not
frown
on
such
silent
kibitzing
therefore
he
wandered
about
until
he
found
a
table
where
four
men
were
playing
stud
poker
here
he
stood
watching
the
game
but
concentrating
on
the
mind
of
the
man
opposite
him
checking
his
mental
impressions
against
the
man
wins
and
losses
he
could
at
any
time
actually
read
in
the
man
mind
what
his
hole
card
was
he
found
but
he
could
quite
easily
sense
from
the
mind
whether
the
latter
considered
it
a
good
one
a
very
poor
one
or
only
a
possible
winner
by
watching
the
play
as
well
as
studying
the
man
feelings
facial
movements
and
muscle
twitches
or
tensenesses
hanlon
was
soon
able
to
make
some
remarkably
accurate
predictions
as
to
what
the
card
was
by
checking
his
deductions
with
the
card
when
it
was
shown
he
saw
he
was
gradually
coming
closer
and
closer
to
a
perfect
score
of
reading
the
next
day
hanlon
again
sat
most
of
the
time
in
the
lounge
his
eyes
closed
letting
his
mind
soak
up
all
the
impressions
and
vibrations
he
could
when
one
seemed
particularly
strong
he
tried
to
follow
it
and
locate
the
person
with
his
mind
not
his
eyes
and
read
the
whole
thought
mostly
he
found
again
excitement
and
pleasure
almost
everyone
on
board
seemed
to
be
having
a
grand
time
and
enjoying
the
trip
to
the
utmost
it
was
what
might
be
expected
a
gay
carefree
holiday
crowd
yet
there
was
occasionally
caught
that
sinister
undercurrent
that
had
so
puzzled
him
since
he
first
sensed
it
the
day
before
it
was
not
prominent
at
any
time
nor
continuous
more
as
though
only
one
or
two
minds
held
the
thought
and
those
not
in
the
lounge
all
the
time
but
wandering
in
and
out
he
tried
to
analyze
the
feeling
of
those
thoughts
they
were
malevolent
that
he
had
sensed
from
the
beginning
and
finally
later
in
the
afternoon
the
person
or
persons
thinking
them
evidently
spent
some
time
near
him
in
the
lounge
for
the
feeling
became
much
clearer
to
the
ss
man
hanlon
still
kept
his
eyes
closed
he
made
no
effort
at
this
time
to
try
to
identify
who
was
giving
out
those
menacing
sensations
that
would
come
later
at
the
moment
he
was
more
interested
in
trying
to
work
out
just
what
those
sinister
impressions
meant
and
gradually
his
mind
was
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
it
could
mean
only
one
thing
a
killing
hanlon
was
devoting
almost
all
his
mind
to
this
problem
when
another
mental
impression
intruded
and
grew
stronger
more
demanding
of
his
attention
it
was
a
feeling
of
sympathetic
concern
yet
diffident
apologetic
he
felt
it
growing
stronger
seeming
to
be
approaching
him
to
be
directed
at
him
for
the
moment
he
left
off
worrying
about
the
other
matter
and
watched
this
new
thought
by
the
instant
it
was
growing
stronger
and
closer
he
knew
that
some
way
he
directed
his
attention
toward
what
he
believed
was
its
source
but
idly
half
angry
at
it
for
interrupting
his
more
important
thoughts
it
was
in
front
of
him
and
suddenly
like
a
bright
white
beam
of
light
his
mind
reached
out
and
touched
directly
the
mind
holding
that
thought
touched
it
it
was
instantly
unbelievably
that
mind
he
was
able
actually
to
the
surface
thoughts
clearly
distinctly
as
though
it
were
his
own
mind
hanlon
knew
he
was
one
with
a
deck
steward
who
had
noticed
him
sitting
there
all
day
and
the
day
before
with
closed
eyes
and
strained
face
his
efforts
at
concentration
must
have
been
too
apparent
he
have
to
learn
to
guard
that
to
keep
his
face
more
impassive
now
the
steward
was
coming
to
see
if
he
was
and
at
that
instant
a
soft
apologetic
voice
spoke
from
in
front
of
him
spoke
words
he
had
already
read
in
that
mind
beg
pardon
hanlon
sir
but
is
anything
wrong
he
opened
his
eyes
lazily
and
let
a
smile
break
out
as
he
saw
the
solicitous
face
of
the
attendant
me
not
really
just
a
little
queazy
but
i
feeling
better
all
the
time
i
glad
but
be
sure
and
call
if
i
can
be
of
any
service
thank
you
i
will
hanlon
reached
in
his
pocket
and
slipped
a
credit
note
into
the
man
hand
and
as
the
steward
walked
away
hanlon
mind
was
instantly
whirling
with
this
ability
he
was
astonished
and
delighted
of
course
but
a
little
disturbed
too
i
was
actually
inside
the
guy
mind
he
thought
in
amazement
a
new
one
i
was
never
able
to
do
that
before
i
really
read
his
thoughts
i
got
to
find
out
more
about
this
let
see
now
how
did
i
do
it
chapter
george
hanlon
glanced
about
the
observation
deck
and
saw
at
some
distance
the
young
man
who
had
sat
at
the
same
dining
table
hanlon
grinned
a
bit
and
directed
his
mind
that
way
to
the
best
of
his
memory
he
concentrated
on
doing
the
same
thing
he
had
done
when
he
got
inside
the
steward
mind
for
long
anxious
minutes
he
tried
he
felt
tense
and
the
strain
made
his
heart
pound
at
last
he
sank
back
into
his
chair
the
other
was
just
a
fluke
i
guess
he
frowned
in
frustration
and
disgust
at
himself
i
keep
thinking
i
getting
good
then
he
idly
sent
his
mind
towards
the
boy
again
and
suddenly
found
himself
once
more
within
another
person
mind
it
was
a
strange
weird
feeling
this
getting
two
sets
of
thoughts
at
the
same
time
also
hanlon
felt
a
bit
as
though
he
was
a
trespasser
in
some
forbidden
temple
yet
he
persevered
trying
to
see
if
he
could
read
anything
there
and
was
disappointed
to
find
he
could
peruse
and
understand
only
the
fleeting
surface
thoughts
with
all
his
might
in
every
way
he
could
think
of
he
tried
to
probe
back
and
beneath
those
passing
but
could
get
no
information
whatever
of
the
young
man
past
or
knowledge
only
vacuous
thoughts
which
were
flowing
idly
through
the
youth
mind
were
available
to
him
he
wondered
if
he
could
influence
the
other
to
do
something
if
he
could
control
another
mind
even
just
a
little
it
would
really
help
in
his
work
so
he
now
tried
every
method
his
agile
mind
could
imagine
to
make
the
fellow
pick
up
the
book
that
lay
beside
his
chair
he
concentrated
on
it
he
insisted
he
willed
it
but
in
vain
he
could
make
no
impression
whatever
hanlon
withdrew
his
mind
i
no
control
he
thought
to
himself
i
ca
take
over
his
mind
in
any
way
neither
can
i
read
his
past
just
his
present
thoughts
that
not
too
bad
although
i
hoped
i
had
hit
the
jackpot
at
last
after
some
further
reflection
the
thought
occurred
maybe
i
can
do
better
with
someone
else
during
the
balance
of
the
day
he
kept
trying
to
read
the
minds
of
others
of
his
fellow
passengers
but
found
the
same
results
in
each
case
he
did
however
develop
the
technique
of
making
a
much
quicker
entrance
into
a
mind
could
do
that
reading
more
swiftly
and
yet
know
he
was
correct
i
get
it
now
i
got
to
approach
it
relaxed
not
all
tensed
up
like
i
was
at
first
he
finally
realized
but
when
it
came
to
probing
into
and
reading
the
whole
mind
into
its
past
thoughts
and
knowledges
no
just
that
no
pessimistically
he
began
to
feel
he
was
going
to
be
able
to
do
as
much
with
his
as
he
and
his
superiors
had
hoped
did
this
mean
he
wondered
disconsolately
as
he
went
to
his
stateroom
that
he
was
to
be
a
failure
in
the
secret
service
or
he
brightened
momently
could
he
develop
other
methods
of
ferreting
out
information
but
that
he
told
himself
honestly
was
out
what
did
he
know
about
detective
work
the
ss
already
had
the
best
detectives
in
the
universe
this
dark
mood
persisted
while
he
went
to
bed
and
finally
dropped
off
to
sleep
but
when
he
awoke
the
next
morning
he
felt
cheerful
again
he
had
a
lot
and
he
would
get
more
he
ate
a
good
breakfast
then
went
back
to
his
deck
chair
and
there
resolutely
he
opened
his
mind
once
more
to
general
impressions
he
would
keep
working
at
it
and
more
was
bound
to
come
look
how
far
advanced
already
a
lot
further
than
when
he
had
started
and
at
that
he
probably
no
undoubtedly
could
do
more
than
any
of
the
other
fellows
on
certain
problems
as
far
as
he
knew
and
dad
and
admiral
rogers
had
talked
as
though
he
were
the
only
one
they
knew
about
no
one
else
could
read
even
surface
thoughts
so
he
kept
diligently
at
it
and
very
soon
so
strongly
he
deduced
the
mind
must
be
very
close
to
him
he
again
found
those
sinister
impressions
that
had
bothered
him
so
much
this
time
he
glanced
about
in
apparently
casual
curiosity
yet
touched
mind
after
mind
of
those
nearest
him
then
hit
pay
dirt
why
it
was
that
bluff
man
in
the
third
chair
to
his
right
he
did
look
vicious
that
was
certain
though
there
was
a
grim
set
to
his
jaw
yet
his
surface
thoughts
showed
the
man
to
be
hard
cold
and
ruthless
a
pure
killer
type
hanson
sensed
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
have
such
a
will
to
power
that
the
lives
and
rights
of
others
are
held
cheaply
contemptuously
the
kind
who
if
another
gets
in
his
way
removes
him
but
carefully
lest
his
own
skin
be
put
in
jeopardy
if
he
could
get
some
one
else
to
do
the
dirty
work
so
much
the
better
such
conscienceless
killers
were
hanlon
knew
usually
arrant
cowards
there
was
someone
on
this
ship
who
was
in
this
man
way
of
that
hanlon
felt
sure
the
killer
was
determined
to
destroy
this
other
the
first
chance
he
got
his
mind
was
now
weighing
chances
and
possible
opportunities
and
hanlon
read
and
learned
yes
this
must
be
one
of
those
interesting
people
that
unknown
ss
tipster
back
on
terra
had
mentioned
was
the
victim
another
probably
for
hanlon
had
not
yet
read
any
thoughts
in
this
killer
mind
about
any
confederates
hanlon
kept
close
watch
on
this
man
and
his
mind
and
picked
up
many
other
stray
bits
of
information
including
his
name
panek
none
seemed
of
too
much
immediate
importance
regarding
the
matter
at
hand
yet
they
gave
the
secret
service
man
a
fairly
good
picture
of
the
personality
when
pieced
all
together
suddenly
and
but
a
barely
passing
whisper
of
thought
hanlon
caught
the
concept
that
the
intended
victim
death
was
necessary
to
the
coup
they
were
planning
on
simonides
hanlon
was
instantly
alerted
by
that
perhaps
this
was
a
definite
lead
for
him
he
strained
to
get
more
the
killer
thought
occasionally
of
a
man
he
called
the
boss
but
not
the
name
of
that
dignitary
nor
his
actual
position
politically
socially
economically
or
otherwise
the
ss
man
fumed
inwardly
because
he
could
not
get
a
clear
picture
of
that
boss
this
murderer
did
not
have
a
visual
type
of
mind
darn
it
he
did
see
clearly
in
pictorial
terms
any
of
the
people
or
scenes
about
which
he
thought
hanlon
had
been
gradually
impressed
though
with
the
realization
that
this
man
was
very
much
afraid
of
his
boss
there
was
a
mental
shiver
every
time
thought
of
his
employer
entered
his
mind
there
was
something
about
a
previous
failure
and
what
would
undoubtedly
happen
unless
it
was
done
now
but
hanlon
could
get
enough
of
that
to
make
any
sense
to
him
again
panek
began
thinking
though
very
sketchily
about
sime
as
he
called
simonides
and
the
plot
that
was
being
hatched
there
hanlon
felt
the
man
sneering
contempt
for
those
beasts
but
could
gain
no
idea
whatever
about
what
that
reference
meant
in
so
many
ways
this
puzzle
seemed
to
be
growing
worse
instead
of
better
and
hanlon
knew
a
moment
of
frustration
but
his
sense
of
humor
came
to
his
rescue
you
want
the
whole
thing
written
out
for
you
in
black
and
white
he
jeered
at
himself
snap
out
of
it
quit
being
a
defeatist
harder
and
more
intently
he
tried
to
probe
into
the
man
mind
oh
if
he
could
only
learn
to
read
below
those
passing
surface
thoughts
to
follow
them
down
and
back
along
the
into
the
total
mind
revealing
though
the
thoughts
he
could
catch
were
for
complete
and
swift
results
he
must
find
the
technique
of
reading
a
mind
completely
if
such
a
thing
were
possible
but
probe
as
he
might
the
way
to
those
deeper
buried
memories
and
thoughts
continued
to
remain
locked
from
him
and
then
panek
got
up
and
left
the
observation
deck
a
light
touch
on
his
knee
some
time
later
snapped
george
hanlon
eyes
wide
open
and
he
looked
down
to
see
a
small
wriggly
dog
looking
up
into
his
face
its
tail
frantically
signals
of
proffered
friendship
the
little
tongue
making
licking
motions
toward
the
hand
the
puppy
could
not
quite
reach
well
hi
fellow
hanlon
reached
down
and
lifted
the
little
dog
onto
his
lap
where
the
latter
wriggled
and
contorted
in
an
ecstasy
of
joy
climbing
all
over
the
young
man
licking
at
his
hands
and
trying
to
reach
his
face
the
puppy
was
so
extremely
happy
and
anxious
to
make
friends
that
hanlon
was
soon
laughing
almost
convulsively
while
trying
to
avoid
those
but
very
moist
kisses
wait
now
boy
take
it
easy
i
like
you
and
all
that
but
let
not
get
carried
away
with
ourselves
hanlon
scratched
the
puppy
behind
one
of
its
floppy
ears
and
pressed
it
firmly
but
gently
down
so
it
was
lying
on
his
lap
that
better
just
lie
there
and
take
it
easy
a
sudden
thought
brought
a
grin
onto
the
young
man
lips
he
tried
to
get
into
the
puppy
mind
and
got
a
real
surprise
for
after
a
few
anxious
moments
of
testing
and
trying
he
did
it
actually
got
the
thoughts
of
pleasure
at
finding
such
a
wonderful
new
friend
with
such
a
effluvium
hanlon
then
tried
to
see
if
he
could
get
into
the
deeper
parts
of
the
dog
mind
and
using
what
knowledge
of
the
technique
he
had
deduced
in
his
previous
though
unsuccessful
attempts
with
humans
found
after
many
more
anxious
minutes
he
could
follow
the
tracks
back
and
back
until
the
dog
whole
mind
was
open
to
him
the
puppy
had
far
more
of
a
mentality
than
hanlon
had
ever
guessed
dogs
had
and
he
knew
they
were
far
from
stupid
this
one
mind
he
could
now
see
was
immature
but
latently
capable
say
this
was
great
hanlon
probed
some
more
and
found
many
sketchy
facts
sketchy
because
the
thoughts
were
incomplete
to
the
puppy
beyond
its
experience
and
not
because
the
man
could
read
perfectly
what
was
there
the
dog
apparently
knew
a
woman
hanlon
got
the
impression
of
skirts
and
answered
when
that
goddess
called
the
word
gypsy
gypsy
eh
hanlon
said
aloud
and
immediately
the
dog
wriggled
from
beneath
his
restraining
hand
and
again
tried
to
climb
up
and
lick
hanlon
face
in
a
frenzy
of
adoration
lie
down
sir
and
be
quiet
hanlon
said
sternly
and
the
puppy
did
so
instantly
without
question
or
hesitation
hanlon
thrilled
realizing
at
once
that
it
was
not
what
he
had
said
that
did
the
trick
but
the
fact
that
he
was
still
inside
the
dog
mind
and
that
it
had
obeyed
his
will
rather
than
his
words
hey
this
needs
looking
into
without
saying
the
words
aloud
this
time
hanlon
commanded
the
dog
or
rather
he
impressed
the
command
directly
onto
the
puppy
mind
with
his
own
to
get
down
off
his
lap
onto
the
deck
instantly
it
leaped
down
lie
down
the
dog
did
so
roll
over
again
silently
but
now
the
puppy
merely
looked
up
at
him
imploringly
quivering
in
an
apparent
emotion
of
indecision
hanlon
realized
the
puppy
did
know
how
to
roll
over
guess
i
need
to
learn
how
to
do
it
before
i
can
teach
or
rather
command
him
to
do
it
hanlon
grinned
wryly
to
himself
for
he
realized
that
to
do
so
he
would
have
to
learn
how
to
control
each
of
the
muscles
and
that
before
he
could
do
that
he
would
have
to
know
what
part
of
the
brain
controlled
the
nerves
that
made
those
muscles
obey
his
commands
and
that
if
possible
at
all
would
take
one
galaxy
of
a
lot
of
study
and
practice
for
the
next
several
minutes
then
he
concentrated
in
making
the
puppy
do
a
number
of
simple
tricks
all
the
time
watching
carefully
to
see
if
possible
the
connecting
links
between
brain
nerves
and
muscles
he
was
beginning
to
make
a
little
headway
in
understanding
this
triple
when
he
heard
a
sudden
gasp
he
looked
up
to
see
a
young
matron
standing
before
him
her
mouth
and
eyes
wide
with
surprise
why
why
gypsy
never
did
any
tricks
before
what
are
you
an
animal
trainer
hanlon
leaped
to
his
feet
the
best
in
the
universe
madam
he
grinned
that
a
mighty
fine
puppy
you
have
he
came
over
and
introduced
himself
and
we
been
having
some
fun
together
yes
he
ran
off
and
i
been
hunting
all
over
for
him
but
how
on
earth
did
you
ever
teach
him
so
quickly
it
a
gift
hanlon
mocked
then
grew
serious
honestly
madam
i
do
know
he
said
quietly
i
just
seem
to
have
a
way
with
dogs
is
all
by
the
way
would
you
sell
me
the
puppy
sell
gypsy
no
thanks
and
she
started
away
calling
to
the
dog
to
follow
but
it
stood
in
indecision
looking
from
one
to
the
other
not
seeming
to
know
whether
to
follow
its
beloved
mistress
or
to
stay
and
play
with
this
nice
new
friend
hanlon
quickly
reached
out
to
the
dog
mind
and
impressed
on
it
that
it
must
follow
the
woman
and
always
do
whatever
she
told
it
the
puppy
then
trotted
away
content
george
hanlon
sank
into
his
deck
chair
this
required
a
good
think
a
mighty
serious
think
he
told
himself
he
would
have
to
work
on
this
as
much
as
on
human
minds
for
if
he
could
control
animals
would
it
work
on
birds
or
insects
maybe
even
fish
then
he
could
get
into
places
he
as
a
man
could
not
go
the
lady
and
dog
had
disappeared
when
hanlon
got
the
inspiration
to
see
if
his
mind
could
find
them
if
he
could
again
contact
the
dog
when
it
was
not
in
sight
and
he
did
not
know
exactly
where
it
was
instantly
effortlessly
it
seemed
as
though
it
happened
merely
because
he
wished
it
to
he
found
himself
again
inside
the
puppy
mind
was
it
because
he
already
knew
that
mind
pattern
he
wondered
anyway
there
he
was
and
now
he
tried
to
see
if
he
could
look
out
through
gypsy
eyes
and
after
much
study
he
did
so
but
the
vision
was
so
distorted
he
wondered
if
his
control
was
at
fault
then
remembered
having
heard
or
read
somewhere
that
a
dog
eyes
do
not
work
exactly
the
same
as
a
man
finally
he
accustomed
himself
to
them
enough
so
he
could
see
that
they
were
going
down
a
narrow
corridor
and
then
they
stopped
before
a
door
which
opened
after
a
moment
the
dog
without
a
command
leaped
through
the
doorway
into
the
stateroom
and
ran
to
its
basket
where
it
lay
panting
looking
up
at
its
mistress
chapter
george
hanlon
withdrew
from
the
puppy
mind
and
thought
seriously
yes
this
matter
of
controlling
the
minds
of
animals
was
one
that
would
require
a
lot
of
thought
and
study
and
a
tremendous
amount
of
practice
but
it
seemed
important
enough
to
justify
those
expenditures
he
hunted
up
his
steward
where
do
the
passengers
keep
their
pets
some
keep
them
in
their
staterooms
sir
but
others
in
the
kennels
down
on
deck
thanks
any
rules
against
my
going
down
there
and
looking
at
i
like
animals
especially
dogs
oh
no
sir
anyone
can
go
down
there
it
on
the
right
hand
side
about
halfway
aft
arrived
at
the
kennels
hanlon
found
the
cages
contained
about
a
dozen
dogs
of
various
breeds
ages
and
sizes
here
were
plenty
of
animal
minds
for
his
experimentation
and
study
after
walking
around
and
looking
at
them
for
some
minutes
he
sat
down
on
a
bench
at
one
side
of
the
cages
and
concentrated
on
the
dog
nearest
him
it
was
a
large
white
bull
and
he
guessed
its
age
to
be
about
five
or
six
years
that
was
just
what
he
wanted
an
adult
mind
to
study
not
that
of
an
immature
puppy
he
had
no
trouble
getting
into
the
dog
mind
and
for
over
an
hour
he
sat
there
studying
it
line
by
line
channel
by
channel
connector
by
connector
while
the
dog
lay
as
if
asleep
gradually
hanlon
began
to
feel
he
was
beginning
to
know
something
about
a
dog
correlation
and
how
it
operated
then
and
only
then
he
woke
the
dog
and
began
experiment
with
control
he
found
it
easy
to
make
the
dog
do
anything
he
wished
that
was
within
the
animal
previous
knowledge
and
experience
what
he
wanted
was
to
see
if
he
could
make
it
perform
motions
and
actions
that
were
outside
its
previous
conditioning
and
training
after
some
fumbling
he
thrilled
to
find
that
now
even
some
of
the
simpler
of
those
things
were
not
too
difficult
although
others
his
present
knowledge
was
not
up
to
handling
his
study
taught
him
to
some
extent
how
to
activate
the
brain
centers
which
controlled
the
nerves
that
sent
messages
to
the
proper
muscles
that
allowed
the
dog
to
do
his
bidding
but
it
still
needed
a
lot
of
study
he
knew
he
had
only
made
a
bare
start
at
learning
what
had
to
be
known
to
do
it
swiftly
and
easily
the
kennel
steward
must
have
noticed
the
strange
antics
of
the
bull
and
then
seeing
hanlon
intent
concentration
figured
there
might
be
some
connection
between
the
two
for
he
came
up
to
the
bench
and
looked
down
somewhat
hostilely
at
the
man
sitting
there
but
his
voice
when
he
spoke
was
very
polite
anything
i
can
do
for
you
sir
hanlon
had
been
concentrating
so
deeply
he
had
not
heard
anyone
come
up
and
the
voice
speaking
so
suddenly
right
before
him
startled
and
befuddled
him
he
looked
up
and
his
mind
felt
sluggish
and
weak
almost
as
though
he
had
been
doped
huh
he
asked
stupidly
i
asked
the
man
tone
was
a
little
sharper
if
there
was
anything
i
could
do
for
you
oh
no
no
thanks
hanlon
forced
himself
to
pay
attention
i
just
like
dogs
and
came
down
here
to
watch
them
must
have
dozed
off
do
you
have
a
dog
of
your
own
here
no
i
have
no
dog
at
present
what
were
you
doing
to
that
white
bull
he
been
acting
very
peculiar
since
you
been
here
me
hanlon
made
himself
look
surprised
why
nothing
i
just
been
sitting
here
have
said
a
word
to
any
of
them
well
i
not
too
sure
it
proper
for
you
to
be
here
as
long
as
you
have
no
dog
kennelled
here
sorry
if
it
bothers
you
i
leave
hanlon
started
away
then
stopped
short
he
had
wondered
at
that
curiously
sluggish
feeling
in
his
mind
now
with
a
start
he
had
trouble
concealing
he
suddenly
realized
a
fact
he
had
seen
and
heard
that
exchange
of
conversation
from
two
separate
and
distinct
points
and
now
he
was
watching
himself
leave
had
heard
and
seen
both
from
his
own
and
from
the
dog
mind
yes
he
suddenly
comprehended
that
the
dog
had
heard
and
every
word
of
that
brief
conversation
not
as
a
dog
might
as
a
man
suddenly
drenched
with
a
cold
sweat
hanlon
knew
he
had
not
merely
been
inside
the
dog
mind
observing
and
controlling
but
that
he
had
actually
a
portion
of
his
own
mind
into
the
dog
brain
no
wonder
his
own
mind
what
was
left
in
his
own
brain
had
felt
somewhat
inadequate
and
lacking
for
the
moment
it
was
not
his
complete
mind
when
the
steward
startled
him
he
had
forgotten
to
withdraw
from
the
bull
brain
now
he
carefully
did
so
and
with
senses
reeling
almost
ran
back
to
his
stateroom
hanlon
threw
himself
onto
the
bed
and
lay
there
trembling
with
awe
at
realization
of
the
immensity
of
what
he
had
done
how
in
the
name
of
snyder
was
such
a
thing
possible
reading
a
impressions
even
the
surface
thoughts
was
well
within
the
realms
of
possibility
he
knew
for
he
had
done
it
himself
even
hundreds
of
years
before
such
things
had
been
believed
possible
and
had
been
studied
extensively
and
scientifically
many
people
throughout
the
centuries
had
claimed
the
ability
to
read
minds
though
only
a
few
had
ever
proven
their
powers
satisfactorily
under
carefully
controlled
laboratory
conditions
he
himself
until
the
past
day
or
so
had
not
been
able
to
read
a
mind
directly
nor
could
he
do
it
perfectly
even
yet
with
humans
also
he
conceded
it
was
a
reasonable
concept
that
if
he
had
any
mental
ability
at
all
with
humans
it
should
be
greater
and
more
efficient
with
animals
for
they
had
less
actual
their
minds
were
far
less
complex
than
human
minds
to
be
able
to
transfer
part
of
his
mind
to
separate
it
dissociate
it
and
have
it
outside
of
his
body
and
in
some
other
body
mind
ai
that
sumpin
he
whistled
in
awed
amazement
pulling
himself
together
with
an
effort
of
will
he
set
his
mind
to
reviewing
carefully
the
entire
episode
and
to
figuring
out
where
all
this
might
fit
in
with
the
business
at
hand
i
thought
when
i
first
got
into
that
pup
mind
that
it
would
be
a
big
help
and
it
will
but
this
will
be
even
more
so
if
i
can
really
control
animals
and
see
and
hear
with
their
eyes
and
ears
and
if
i
can
send
them
where
i
want
them
to
go
and
send
my
mind
or
part
of
it
along
with
them
and
still
know
what
it
and
they
are
doing
that
will
be
tremendous
he
remembered
how
he
had
been
able
to
get
into
the
puppy
mind
after
it
had
gone
out
of
sight
so
now
he
sent
his
mind
down
to
the
kennels
again
without
any
trouble
without
any
delay
or
hesitation
he
found
himself
inside
the
bull
mind
and
could
look
out
through
the
cage
wires
and
see
the
rest
of
the
kennel
deck
he
withdrew
and
lay
there
almost
dumbfounded
how
did
i
ever
get
such
ability
he
wondered
no
one
else
in
our
family
has
it
am
i
some
sort
of
a
mutant
but
if
so
how
or
why
i
never
heard
dad
or
mother
mention
it
he
had
lots
of
questions
but
no
answers
but
thinking
about
this
new
ability
and
his
job
with
the
secret
service
suddenly
reminded
him
of
that
potential
murderer
he
had
been
watching
he
realized
with
dismay
that
in
his
excitement
over
this
latest
development
he
had
entirely
forgotten
that
angle
he
had
better
get
back
on
the
ball
but
fast
he
got
up
splashed
cold
water
on
his
face
dried
it
ran
a
comb
through
his
hair
and
went
back
to
the
lounge
the
man
panek
was
not
in
the
observation
lounge
so
hanlon
went
seeking
him
just
as
he
neared
the
game
rooms
on
his
rounds
he
saw
his
man
leaving
them
allowing
the
stranger
to
get
some
distance
ahead
hanlon
trailed
him
as
carefully
as
he
could
all
the
time
trying
to
read
what
the
killer
had
in
mind
not
entirely
to
his
surprise
hanlon
found
he
could
now
read
the
surface
thoughts
even
more
easily
than
formerly
thus
he
soon
knew
emphatically
that
the
man
was
definitely
bent
on
that
contemplated
killing
right
now
that
the
victim
was
in
his
stateroom
but
was
going
to
leave
it
shortly
in
response
to
a
faked
hanlon
also
learned
that
the
murderer
had
a
knife
concealed
in
his
sleeve
and
was
adept
in
its
use
the
ss
man
mind
rocketed
swiftly
what
was
he
to
do
he
did
want
a
murder
done
but
neither
did
he
want
this
man
killed
nor
jailed
at
least
not
until
he
had
learned
a
great
deal
more
concerning
him
and
his
part
in
or
knowledge
of
that
plot
on
simonides
that
hanlon
and
the
corps
were
trying
so
desperately
to
solve
i
got
to
learn
to
consider
mighty
carefully
all
the
angles
about
even
the
most
things
he
thought
carefully
i
ca
take
chances
of
gumming
things
up
but
on
the
other
hand
i
want
to
get
an
with
that
gang
if
i
can
a
possibility
occurred
to
the
young
agent
and
he
quailed
a
bit
then
grinned
wolfishly
at
the
thought
it
was
plenty
dangerous
but
if
he
could
put
it
over
maybe
it
would
give
him
that
in
he
needed
he
hurried
his
steps
and
caught
up
with
the
big
man
just
as
the
latter
was
stopping
momentarily
to
peer
cautiously
around
the
corner
and
down
a
corridor
which
hanlon
could
read
in
his
mind
led
to
the
stateroom
hanlon
tapped
the
man
on
the
shoulder
and
as
the
fellow
whirled
a
snarl
on
his
face
hanlon
stepped
backward
a
pace
and
held
up
his
hands
in
the
i
not
armed
gesture
then
before
panek
could
speak
he
stepped
closer
to
whisper
but
the
thug
was
both
angry
and
frustrated
at
the
spoiling
of
his
plan
and
in
no
mood
for
conversation
that
lethal
knife
seemed
to
jump
out
of
his
sleeve
and
toward
hanlon
in
the
strong
swift
practiced
hand
of
the
killer
the
ss
man
jumped
backward
then
his
own
hands
darted
out
and
grabbed
for
the
other
wrists
in
the
manner
he
had
been
taught
he
caught
the
right
or
knife
hand
but
the
big
fellow
was
as
dextrous
as
he
even
if
he
did
look
capable
of
such
fast
action
his
other
hand
eluded
hanlon
grasp
and
with
it
panek
struck
and
jabbed
heavy
blows
to
hanlon
face
and
body
hanlon
parried
the
blows
as
best
he
could
at
the
same
time
trying
to
make
his
words
penetrate
cut
it
out
you
fool
i
trying
to
help
you
not
hinder
you
stop
it
blast
you
and
listen
but
he
might
as
well
have
been
talking
to
the
metal
walls
one
eye
was
swelling
rapidly
and
he
had
a
nick
in
his
arm
that
he
could
feel
was
soaking
his
jacket
sleeve
seeing
he
could
make
the
fellow
listen
hanlon
threw
him
with
a
trick
then
sat
on
him
shut
up
and
listen
to
me
panek
he
hissed
urgently
using
all
his
fighting
technique
meanwhile
to
keep
the
other
threshing
form
immobile
i
trying
to
warn
you
that
the
bozo
you
after
carries
one
of
those
new
and
the
needles
are
also
the
fastest
man
on
the
draw
i
ever
seen
i
watched
him
practice
just
one
of
those
needles
and
you
be
kaput
before
you
could
yell
why
how
what
mean
huh
what
mean
the
man
stopped
his
struggles
for
the
moment
while
his
face
showed
plainly
how
aghast
he
was
at
this
interfering
stranger
apparent
knowledge
of
his
intentions
who
are
you
huh
and
what
your
game
what
your
game
hanlon
made
his
voice
seem
both
friendly
and
calculating
and
hurried
on
with
his
specious
explanation
before
the
fellow
should
start
fighting
again
i
been
tipped
off
there
was
something
up
on
simonides
where
a
good
hustler
could
make
himself
plenty
of
credits
and
credits
in
quantity
is
what
i
after
what
that
got
to
do
with
me
huh
what
has
it
and
i
on
my
way
there
to
see
what
my
chances
are
of
getting
in
on
the
game
so
naturally
i
tried
to
learn
all
i
could
about
it
ahead
of
time
i
was
told
this
bird
you
after
was
an
important
man
there
so
i
studied
him
one
of
the
first
things
i
found
out
about
him
was
that
he
carried
one
of
those
needlers
if
he
in
your
way
together
we
oughta
be
able
to
get
rid
of
him
but
let
play
it
safe
eh
the
stranger
gave
him
a
cold
calculating
with
those
hard
suspicious
eyes
let
me
up
bub
let
me
up
i
be
good
while
we
talk
hanlon
rose
but
stood
warily
as
the
other
slowly
climbed
to
his
feet
but
he
was
sharp
enough
panek
hand
flashed
out
even
before
he
seemed
to
be
standing
erect
and
slickly
grabbed
the
wallet
from
the
inside
pocket
of
hanlon
jacket
but
the
ss
man
seeing
what
the
other
was
after
stood
there
without
making
any
resistance
take
your
time
looking
at
pal
he
said
easily
i
clean
strictly
on
my
own
in
this
just
got
kicked
out
of
that
snake
nest
of
a
corps
school
on
terra
the
killer
head
snapped
up
at
mention
of
the
corps
and
he
stared
harder
and
more
suspiciously
than
ever
into
hanlon
eyes
they
said
i
cheated
at
exams
and
would
give
me
a
chance
to
defend
myself
hanlon
continued
quickly
but
with
heat
that
soured
me
on
but
good
so
i
says
to
myself
blast
john
law
from
now
on
on
the
other
side
anything
he
after
must
be
worth
plenty
to
any
guy
who
can
outsmart
him
knowing
his
side
of
it
and
how
he
works
i
figure
i
just
that
good
he
said
all
this
with
such
a
deadly
serious
voice
that
although
it
was
bravado
panek
could
see
it
was
also
confidence
hanlon
had
figured
this
was
his
best
bet
tell
his
side
of
it
first
for
if
he
got
in
with
them
or
any
gang
they
would
be
sure
to
check
and
would
find
out
he
had
been
a
cadet
anyway
beat
to
the
punch
before
they
form
any
contrariwise
conclusions
was
his
judgment
his
plan
seemed
to
be
working
for
as
his
explanation
continued
and
was
completed
the
killer
looked
at
him
with
some
measure
of
respect
although
his
eyes
and
manner
were
still
filled
with
suspicion
ca
blame
you
for
feeling
sore
ca
blame
you
if
they
really
did
kick
you
out
but
i
do
trust
nobody
that
ever
had
any
connection
at
all
with
the
cops
do
trust
look
pal
use
your
head
if
i
was
a
john
law
would
i
merely
have
stopped
you
i
be
arresting
you
or
killing
you
for
pulling
that
knife
on
me
i
tell
you
i
clean
and
that
i
want
an
on
simonides
i
heard
too
there
was
good
pickings
on
sime
the
man
said
slowly
i
not
in
on
anything
special
myself
not
in
on
it
this
here
a
purely
personal
grudge
deal
but
you
did
me
a
good
turn
a
good
turn
and
if
you
want
to
look
me
up
after
we
land
i
maybe
could
introduce
you
to
a
man
or
two
i
did
know
old
abrams
carried
one
of
them
needlers
did
know
that
the
thanks
in
his
gruff
voice
showed
his
respect
for
those
silent
deadly
little
guns
that
name
abrams
rang
a
bell
in
hanlon
mind
though
he
quickly
decided
he
better
let
it
lie
for
the
moment
file
it
away
for
future
investigation
he
smiled
in
comradely
fashion
the
way
you
were
walking
into
it
made
me
sure
you
did
know
and
thanks
maybe
i
will
look
you
up
i
know
anyone
on
simonides
and
it
does
hurt
to
have
a
friend
or
three
where
do
i
find
you
there
evenings
i
often
at
the
bacchus
tavern
and
with
a
sinister
grimace
if
you
come
you
better
pray
that
likes
you
sure
better
chapter
ss
man
george
hanlon
went
slowly
back
to
his
room
where
he
could
think
seriously
without
the
outside
abstractions
he
would
be
sure
to
encounter
in
any
of
the
public
rooms
he
had
made
a
good
bid
he
thought
for
contact
with
what
he
felt
sure
must
be
the
group
he
wanted
to
get
in
with
hanlon
felt
statement
that
he
personally
was
not
in
on
it
was
just
so
much
that
last
crack
about
you
better
pray
that
likes
you
was
almost
sure
proof
but
what
did
it
mean
who
was
this
he
and
why
had
hanlon
better
pray
he
liked
him
probably
the
leader
and
if
so
undoubtedly
a
dangerous
man
to
play
around
with
hanlon
remembered
the
fear
of
his
boss
he
read
in
panek
mind
also
what
about
abrams
hanlon
felt
sure
it
was
the
same
man
he
had
guarded
that
day
oh
oh
was
that
failure
he
had
also
read
in
mind
that
unsuccessful
attempt
he
hanlon
had
thwarted
was
panek
and
through
him
this
leader
behind
that
attempt
on
life
these
were
questions
he
could
not
answer
yet
not
enough
data
but
he
would
have
to
find
the
answers
sometime
and
once
in
panek
gang
he
might
find
them
and
even
if
this
particular
gang
was
not
the
one
doing
the
plotting
in
which
the
corps
was
so
interested
hanlon
felt
that
getting
into
even
one
of
the
organized
gangs
on
simonides
would
be
a
step
in
the
right
direction
but
he
would
have
to
watch
his
step
those
fellows
would
be
about
as
safe
to
play
with
as
a
pitful
of
cobras
for
a
long
moment
he
grew
cold
with
fear
a
deadly
paralyzing
terror
that
twisted
his
vitals
into
hard
hard
knots
what
business
did
he
have
mixing
with
mature
deadly
killers
such
as
these
on
the
other
hand
he
consoled
himself
after
awhile
being
able
to
read
their
surface
thoughts
should
warn
him
when
he
started
getting
out
of
line
then
if
or
when
he
did
he
would
walk
more
softly
travel
inch
by
inch
and
not
make
any
attempts
to
jump
into
the
big
middle
of
things
until
he
got
a
lot
more
information
and
more
experience
in
the
ways
and
means
of
gangsterism
but
suddenly
he
felt
that
cold
fear
return
those
men
were
must
be
hard
trained
killers
all
this
panek
was
not
even
the
boss
was
just
a
gunny
and
those
would
be
much
worse
than
panek
more
ruthless
and
more
contemptuous
of
human
life
and
rights
they
would
have
to
be
to
be
the
for
hanlon
sensed
that
in
such
a
group
might
very
decidedly
made
right
and
power
it
took
some
time
to
quiet
his
shrieking
nerves
nor
did
he
ever
forget
the
awfulness
of
that
fear
that
so
nearly
brought
him
down
out
of
control
on
the
other
hand
never
again
did
he
reach
such
depths
of
utter
panic
he
finally
rose
bathed
and
dressed
for
dinner
but
during
the
meal
his
mind
was
in
such
a
turmoil
he
had
trouble
keeping
himself
outwardly
calm
for
the
first
time
in
more
years
than
he
could
remember
he
merely
toyed
with
his
food
and
he
had
always
been
a
good
but
he
had
something
very
important
to
do
tonight
and
he
would
let
nothing
keep
him
from
it
so
he
went
to
the
library
and
studied
from
such
books
on
biology
and
physiology
as
he
could
find
all
he
could
about
the
brain
and
the
nerves
that
formed
the
connecting
links
between
it
and
the
muscles
he
studied
until
the
dimming
of
the
lights
told
him
that
day
was
over
he
then
sent
his
mind
down
into
the
brain
of
the
bulldog
and
watched
through
its
eyes
until
he
saw
the
kennel
steward
leave
for
the
night
then
hanlon
went
down
to
the
kennel
deck
sitting
on
the
same
bench
as
before
hanlon
sent
his
mind
into
that
of
the
white
bull
again
he
had
no
trouble
attaching
a
portion
of
his
mind
to
the
dog
brain
a
little
experimentation
soon
showed
how
much
of
his
mind
that
brain
could
contain
then
from
the
he
studied
that
brain
line
by
line
muscle
and
nerve
channels
and
connectors
even
more
surely
than
he
had
been
able
to
do
before
the
first
thing
he
learned
and
put
into
practice
was
to
make
the
dog
sleep
so
he
would
tire
too
much
after
nearly
three
hours
of
intensive
study
he
was
convinced
he
was
beginning
to
know
it
quite
well
although
he
realized
how
much
there
still
was
for
him
to
learn
how
much
study
and
practice
he
would
need
he
then
woke
the
dog
and
while
still
leaving
that
part
of
his
mind
in
its
brain
scanned
the
next
cage
which
held
a
beautiful
female
airedale
into
her
brain
he
sent
another
portion
of
his
mind
then
into
the
next
dog
another
portion
and
on
and
on
until
he
had
detached
more
than
of
his
mind
and
was
controlling
directly
eight
dogs
his
body
felt
weak
and
listless
as
it
sagged
on
the
bench
and
he
made
it
lie
down
there
in
the
there
was
he
was
afraid
at
the
time
little
more
than
enough
mind
left
in
his
body
to
keep
the
functions
going
it
was
the
most
weird
sensation
imaginable
having
portions
of
his
mind
in
nine
places
at
once
having
nine
different
and
distinct
viewpoints
he
found
he
could
do
although
not
too
well
at
first
nine
different
things
at
once
and
the
same
time
or
could
make
all
the
bodies
he
was
controlling
do
the
same
thing
at
the
same
time
he
drilled
the
dogs
making
them
line
up
walk
left
or
right
or
back
up
all
in
unison
he
found
that
while
his
mind
was
divided
and
controlling
different
bodies
there
was
a
thread
of
connecting
thought
between
them
all
so
that
he
knew
what
each
of
the
others
was
doing
yet
it
was
not
a
central
command
each
individual
could
and
did
do
its
own
deciding
and
commanding
for
hours
hanlon
practiced
with
the
dogs
until
he
had
worked
out
the
procedure
to
the
point
where
he
knew
he
could
make
them
perform
singly
as
a
group
or
each
doing
a
different
thing
almost
any
task
of
which
their
body
muscles
were
capable
whether
they
had
previously
known
how
to
do
it
or
not
bringing
his
back
from
seven
of
the
dogs
into
his
own
brain
after
commanding
them
to
sleep
he
went
over
to
the
cage
of
the
airedale
he
was
still
controlling
squatting
down
before
the
bars
he
took
a
and
piece
of
paper
from
his
pocket
these
he
passed
through
the
bars
and
laid
at
her
feet
then
while
he
watched
with
his
own
mind
through
his
own
eyes
he
used
only
the
portion
of
his
mind
that
was
inside
her
brain
and
made
the
airedale
pick
up
the
pencil
in
her
teeth
blunt
end
inside
her
mouth
holding
it
thus
she
attempted
to
write
on
the
paper
which
she
held
steady
with
her
two
front
paws
anxious
minutes
passed
while
hanlon
sweatingly
experimented
at
last
the
dog
managed
to
print
very
roughly
and
clumsily
a
few
letters
they
were
large
and
very
crude
it
was
that
he
could
control
her
muscles
it
was
simply
that
the
muscles
were
not
built
to
do
such
things
without
infinite
training
when
it
finally
became
so
near
morning
that
he
knew
he
had
to
quit
hanlon
left
the
kennels
and
went
to
bed
he
was
still
amazed
excited
and
thrilled
about
this
strange
and
weird
ability
but
he
was
also
well
content
with
his
studies
if
a
time
came
when
he
might
wish
or
need
to
use
animals
in
his
work
he
felt
capable
of
managing
them
yet
again
he
realized
how
much
there
was
to
learn
that
he
must
continue
practicing
and
studying
at
every
opportunity
did
cats
or
horses
or
birds
or
insects
have
brains
that
worked
the
same
as
the
dogs
he
would
have
to
experiment
to
find
that
out
first
chance
he
got
but
now
there
was
another
very
serious
problem
demanding
his
attention
he
had
made
a
wonderful
start
at
getting
an
in
with
panek
the
simonidean
thug
now
how
could
he
best
turn
that
to
his
advantage
it
was
some
time
before
he
fell
asleep
from
sheer
weariness
nor
had
he
solved
the
problem
before
he
did
so
the
moment
he
awoke
late
the
next
morning
he
knew
he
had
the
answer
his
must
have
solved
it
for
him
while
he
slept
at
brunch
he
kept
his
eyes
open
and
before
too
long
panek
came
into
the
dining
room
for
his
lunch
hanlon
signalled
and
his
acquaintance
came
to
his
table
their
orders
given
and
the
waiter
on
his
way
hanlon
opened
up
look
pard
i
do
want
to
butt
into
your
business
but
if
you
want
this
abrams
out
of
your
way
i
be
glad
to
take
a
crack
at
it
for
you
the
simonidean
looked
at
him
scornfully
think
you
that
good
eh
me
at
bumping
off
a
man
huh
me
oh
no
hanlon
made
his
face
seem
very
apologetic
and
his
tone
the
same
i
not
setting
myself
even
one
notch
ahead
of
you
nor
criticizing
your
way
of
working
better
not
neither
but
every
man
has
his
own
techniques
look
in
this
case
aboard
a
ship
in
space
where
you
ca
run
or
hide
i
think
my
way
would
work
best
the
other
was
becoming
interested
in
spite
of
himself
and
his
truculence
melted
a
bit
although
his
tone
was
still
sneering
all
right
master
mind
how
you
handle
it
how
would
you
a
gun
or
knife
is
all
right
on
some
jobs
hanlon
leaned
closer
and
spoke
in
a
but
earnestly
but
there
are
times
when
plain
foolish
to
sneak
up
behind
a
man
and
hit
him
on
the
head
with
a
club
yeah
you
got
something
there
got
something
in
such
a
case
i
figure
it
a
lot
better
to
make
friends
with
the
guy
take
him
to
dinner
then
sneak
a
little
cyanide
in
his
coffee
something
like
that
panek
was
impressed
hanlon
read
the
swift
thoughts
racing
across
the
other
mind
he
had
liked
the
idea
of
using
his
knife
here
on
this
ship
but
neither
did
he
dare
report
back
to
that
feared
boss
that
he
had
succeeded
in
killing
abrams
panek
spoke
doubtfully
yeah
that
may
be
all
right
but
not
when
the
guy
knows
you
then
you
ca
get
away
with
a
thing
like
that
not
when
he
knows
you
exactly
what
i
getting
at
hanlon
said
eagerly
me
i
the
unknown
quantity
nobody
knows
me
i
can
get
to
old
abrams
and
make
it
all
seem
natural
he
ai
easy
to
fool
no
he
ai
i
sure
he
is
but
since
i
got
to
make
a
start
somewhere
if
i
want
to
get
into
things
on
simonides
i
figure
giving
you
an
assist
is
worth
the
trial
well
panek
hesitated
and
his
cold
eyes
bored
into
those
of
this
enigmatic
young
man
i
still
do
quite
trust
you
ca
be
sure
i
trust
you
i
still
figure
you
some
kind
of
a
cop
hanlon
his
face
dark
with
intense
anger
do
ever
call
me
a
cop
he
blazed
though
still
in
a
whisper
i
hate
as
a
kid
i
thought
they
were
tops
and
did
everything
i
could
to
get
into
their
school
but
i
mighty
quick
found
out
how
wrong
i
was
i
was
good
and
sick
of
and
about
ready
to
quit
when
they
threw
me
out
on
that
lie
about
cheating
say
i
knew
their
instructors
so
why
i
need
to
cheat
easy
pal
take
it
easy
they
just
want
to
use
their
high
and
mighty
authority
hanlon
ignored
panek
shushing
they
just
like
to
push
people
around
they
got
on
a
pretty
uniform
his
voice
had
risen
in
pitch
until
panek
had
to
grab
his
arm
and
shake
him
to
make
him
keep
still
people
at
the
nearer
table
were
beginning
to
look
at
them
but
panek
was
impressed
now
with
hanlon
sincerity
the
ss
man
could
read
that
in
his
mind
all
right
pal
all
right
do
bust
a
gut
you
bump
off
old
abrams
without
getting
caught
and
i
get
you
in
with
a
gang
on
sime
where
you
can
really
do
yourself
some
good
really
some
good
hanlon
nodded
shortly
and
rose
i
keep
in
touch
and
your
man
as
good
as
dead
right
now
his
heart
was
singing
his
plan
was
working
smoothly
now
if
that
government
man
had
any
brains
and
would
play
along
hanlon
found
abrams
in
the
library
and
slipped
into
the
seat
next
to
him
opening
a
magazine
and
holding
it
fairly
high
before
his
face
while
apparently
reading
it
hanlon
started
talking
in
low
but
penetrant
tones
do
look
up
abrams
but
listen
to
me
you
may
or
may
not
know
it
but
there
a
plot
against
your
life
i
managed
to
delay
it
yesterday
but
they
intended
getting
you
before
we
reach
port
now
i
have
a
plan
i
earnestly
beg
you
to
listen
and
work
with
me
the
simonidean
had
given
a
slight
start
when
he
heard
hanlon
first
words
but
he
had
been
in
a
hard
school
and
in
no
other
way
had
even
shown
that
he
heard
now
however
he
spoke
as
guardedly
as
hanlon
who
is
trying
to
kill
me
a
man
named
panek
but
someone
behind
him
that
i
do
know
but
the
question
is
will
you
work
with
me
yes
if
i
can
abandoning
his
attempts
at
secrecy
hanlon
started
laughing
out
loud
as
though
at
something
he
was
reading
as
abrams
looked
up
in
surprise
hanlon
leaned
over
and
held
out
his
magazine
in
front
of
the
simonidean
pointing
at
it
play
up
now
he
said
softly
and
the
diplomat
quick
on
the
pretended
to
look
at
what
hanlon
was
showing
him
then
began
laughing
in
turn
thereafter
the
ice
broken
as
far
as
any
might
know
the
two
talked
naturally
as
shipboard
acquaintances
might
do
why
abrams
really
looked
at
hanlon
for
the
first
time
you
the
young
man
who
saved
my
life
on
terra
are
you
yes
but
keep
it
quiet
i
want
us
to
stick
together
more
or
less
the
rest
of
the
day
as
though
we
just
met
and
liked
each
other
then
have
dinner
together
do
you
have
your
own
servant
my
valet
yes
and
he
is
absolutely
trustworthy
why
while
we
eating
i
appear
to
put
something
into
your
drink
while
you
not
looking
a
few
moments
later
you
act
as
though
you
were
suddenly
taken
ill
and
go
to
your
room
have
your
valet
later
let
the
word
out
that
you
very
ill
and
send
word
by
for
an
ambulance
to
meet
the
ship
just
before
landing
let
him
say
died
the
ambulance
can
take
you
wherever
it
natural
your
body
would
be
taken
and
you
keep
under
cover
for
some
time
until
i
notify
you
can
do
hmmm
the
other
thought
rapidly
but
cogently
for
some
minutes
with
a
few
minor
variations
yes
but
why
oh
i
see
you
want
to
get
in
with
the
gang
is
that
it
when
hanlon
nodded
abrams
continued
playing
a
dangerous
game
but
that
what
we
learned
to
expect
of
your
corpsmen
a
wonderful
group
thanks
hanlon
did
not
want
to
explain
anything
so
let
it
go
at
that
and
the
two
talked
companionably
of
many
things
as
they
moved
naturally
about
the
ship
they
listened
for
a
while
to
a
concert
in
the
music
room
then
played
a
few
games
of
cards
each
time
the
diplomat
tried
to
ask
questions
hanlon
the
ss
man
had
seen
panek
cautiously
spying
on
them
from
time
to
time
and
when
the
two
went
in
to
dinner
the
thug
took
a
seat
nearby
but
where
abrams
could
not
see
him
hanlon
had
been
probing
abrams
mind
all
this
time
but
had
been
unable
to
get
any
clue
as
to
a
plot
that
might
upset
the
peace
of
his
world
or
the
federation
hanlon
realized
the
man
was
an
intense
patriot
and
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
abrams
did
not
particularly
like
the
prime
minister
but
the
why
of
that
dislike
eluded
him
the
two
were
about
finished
with
dinner
and
their
coffee
had
been
served
hanlon
called
his
companion
attention
to
something
behind
him
as
the
latter
turned
to
look
hanlon
hand
flashed
out
and
hovered
an
instant
over
the
other
cup
a
few
moments
later
the
simonidean
played
his
part
to
perfection
he
took
a
drink
then
another
and
almost
before
he
had
set
his
cup
down
gave
a
groan
and
clutched
at
his
stomach
and
throat
he
rose
shakily
and
tottered
away
heavily
on
the
arm
of
an
anxious
steward
who
had
come
running
up
hanlon
although
he
rose
quickly
and
made
his
face
seem
concerned
and
sympathetic
resumed
his
seat
and
finished
his
coffee
when
the
steward
returned
he
called
him
over
and
seemed
reassured
when
the
latter
reported
that
abrams
had
said
it
was
apparently
only
an
attack
of
indigestion
to
which
he
was
prone
and
that
his
man
could
take
care
of
him
but
the
next
day
word
ran
about
the
ship
that
abrams
was
very
ill
and
not
expected
to
live
the
day
out
panek
sauntered
past
where
hanlon
was
sitting
reading
and
stopped
to
ask
for
a
light
nice
work
pal
nice
work
he
whispered
as
he
was
lighting
his
cigaro
see
me
at
the
bacchus
but
his
thoughts
as
hanlon
scanned
them
were
muttering
viciously
i
cut
out
his
guts
if
he
planning
to
louse
up
plans
sure
carve
him
and
a
bit
later
as
hanlon
reviewed
the
entire
episode
he
thanked
his
stars
that
panek
was
a
lot
less
than
an
intellectual
giant
a
brighter
man
would
have
wondered
about
the
source
of
hanlon
knowledge
of
his
homicidal
plans
and
how
it
happened
that
hanlon
carried
a
supply
of
poison
there
had
been
no
indication
that
either
question
had
occurred
to
panek
chapter
the
moment
he
got
off
the
ship
and
went
into
the
city
of
new
athens
he
could
feel
it
there
was
an
air
of
mystery
of
secretiveness
of
intrigue
that
could
not
help
but
be
noticed
by
one
as
sensitive
to
as
ss
man
george
hanlon
he
got
out
of
his
at
the
entrance
of
a
great
park
in
the
center
of
the
city
but
directed
the
driver
to
take
his
luggage
on
to
the
hotel
then
hanlon
went
in
to
sit
on
a
bench
beneath
a
beautiful
flowering
tree
once
there
he
opened
his
mind
to
its
fullest
extent
and
let
all
the
impressions
and
sensations
of
this
new
world
soak
in
he
could
not
of
course
get
any
factual
details
in
this
way
nor
did
he
expect
to
what
he
wanted
and
began
to
get
was
the
feel
of
the
city
and
the
longer
he
sat
the
less
he
liked
it
for
he
could
sense
so
clearly
that
there
most
certainly
was
a
mercutian
in
the
fuel
pit
here
somewhere
but
what
it
was
what
this
strange
feeling
portended
he
could
not
quite
make
out
he
noticed
casually
that
there
were
the
usual
idlers
in
this
park
and
hundreds
of
children
with
their
nurses
or
parents
but
there
were
none
of
the
derelicts
one
sees
in
so
many
parks
most
of
the
people
seemed
and
not
too
poor
he
could
catch
occasional
bits
of
thought
about
big
business
deals
after
a
time
hanlon
noticed
that
here
as
in
most
parks
hundreds
of
native
birds
were
flying
and
hopping
about
seeking
what
crumbs
they
could
scrounge
from
picnickers
lunches
or
nuts
fed
them
by
interested
idlers
he
wondered
if
he
could
get
into
a
bird
mind
and
sent
his
out
to
contact
one
his
ability
was
he
found
much
the
same
as
it
had
been
with
the
dogs
he
could
not
only
read
what
mind
the
pigeon
had
but
could
control
it
could
actually
project
part
of
his
mind
into
the
bird
brain
the
was
different
but
as
he
sat
there
for
another
hour
he
learned
the
difference
for
now
he
knew
what
to
look
for
and
it
did
not
take
long
until
he
knew
it
well
finally
he
got
so
he
could
see
and
understand
what
the
people
around
him
were
doing
not
through
his
own
direct
observation
but
through
the
pigeon
senses
he
sent
several
winging
high
into
the
air
and
got
a
good
perspective
of
the
entire
city
at
last
he
brought
his
mind
back
into
his
own
brain
and
gave
a
mental
shrug
then
rose
from
the
bench
you
just
stalling
you
know
he
scolded
himself
get
to
the
hotel
check
in
then
go
look
in
the
bank
vault
you
got
a
job
to
do
so
get
doing
it
from
the
hotel
he
went
to
the
bank
and
signed
up
for
a
box
there
was
nothing
yet
for
him
in
box
so
he
left
a
note
addressed
to
any
ss
man
stating
he
was
here
and
ready
to
begin
his
work
back
at
the
hotel
he
unpacked
took
a
shower
and
then
a
short
nap
there
was
no
telling
what
the
night
might
bring
forth
and
he
wanted
all
his
strength
and
powers
new
athens
was
a
beautiful
city
as
befitted
the
capitol
of
the
richest
planet
in
the
federation
for
simonides
four
had
become
just
that
even
outstripping
terra
in
the
wealth
from
her
manufacturers
and
exports
her
shipments
of
ores
jewels
unusual
furs
manufactured
goods
precision
tools
and
art
products
as
well
as
foodstuffs
raw
and
processed
ran
into
trillions
of
credits
every
year
the
great
square
showed
plainly
that
some
architect
or
city
planner
with
a
love
of
classic
lines
had
been
in
charge
here
the
buildings
were
all
modern
representations
of
the
great
temples
and
public
buildings
of
the
golden
age
of
greece
on
terra
they
were
widely
spaced
with
magnificent
lawns
and
gardens
surrounding
each
thousands
of
lights
artfully
concealed
accentuated
the
beauty
of
those
wonderful
buildings
and
hanlon
caught
his
breath
in
pleasure
at
his
first
sight
of
the
marvelous
square
by
night
he
had
thought
it
wonderful
by
day
now
he
admitted
without
reservation
that
it
was
the
most
magnificent
sight
he
had
ever
seen
he
finally
signalled
a
new
athens
had
no
slideways
to
go
to
the
bacchus
it
was
several
blocks
from
the
square
but
each
of
the
streets
he
travelled
were
almost
as
beautiful
the
tavern
was
housed
in
a
large
though
building
with
a
pillared
facade
the
main
room
was
level
with
a
gardened
terrace
five
steps
above
the
street
inside
the
tavern
was
tastefully
decorated
in
subdued
colors
it
was
dimly
lighted
by
representations
of
flambeaus
stuck
at
angles
in
the
walls
the
center
of
the
room
was
occupied
by
dozens
of
tables
of
varying
sizes
while
along
one
side
and
part
of
the
back
were
curtained
booths
along
the
other
side
ran
an
ornate
bar
hanlon
made
his
way
to
the
latter
and
sat
on
one
of
the
upholstered
stools
the
bar
girls
he
noted
with
interest
were
revealingly
costumed
in
of
a
purplish
silkish
material
they
wore
no
blouses
but
long
sashes
that
passed
behind
the
neck
crossed
the
breasts
and
tied
about
the
waist
to
hold
up
the
short
skirt
one
of
the
girls
came
up
to
get
his
order
i
new
on
the
planet
he
smiled
let
me
have
your
best
native
light
wine
she
brought
him
a
glass
filled
with
a
sparkling
golden
liquid
and
waited
while
he
took
his
first
appreciative
sip
we
call
it
nectar
she
smiled
he
smacked
his
lips
wonderful
then
as
she
started
away
he
called
her
back
do
you
know
a
panek
i
was
to
meet
him
here
but
i
see
him
her
eyes
widened
a
bit
at
that
name
i
see
if
i
can
locate
him
for
you
sir
and
she
moved
away
some
minutes
later
while
he
was
still
pretending
to
sip
his
drink
hanlon
felt
a
hearty
clap
on
the
shoulder
well
well
it
my
pal
from
the
ship
welcome
to
sime
pal
welcome
to
sime
hi
panek
hope
you
meant
that
about
looking
you
up
here
i
am
hanlon
flipped
a
credit
note
on
the
bar
and
followed
panek
he
was
led
toward
a
back
corner
but
there
instead
of
going
into
one
of
the
booths
panek
pushed
through
an
almost
hidden
alcove
he
knocked
peculiarly
on
a
door
and
a
peephole
was
opened
when
the
guardian
saw
who
it
was
the
door
was
opened
enough
so
the
two
could
slide
through
hanlon
in
a
quick
comprehensive
glance
saw
that
it
was
a
fairly
large
office
at
present
occupied
by
four
men
this
is
george
hanlon
panek
introduced
him
the
guy
who
did
that
job
on
old
abrams
the
same
guy
hanlon
noticed
that
panek
did
not
name
the
men
there
but
he
could
see
they
appeared
to
know
all
about
him
and
were
giving
him
a
close
hanlon
scanned
back
in
return
his
mind
quickly
touching
one
after
another
of
the
three
sitting
in
large
easy
chairs
only
their
surface
thoughts
were
readable
and
he
knew
at
first
touch
they
were
but
underlings
the
same
as
panek
he
read
a
favorable
impression
of
himself
but
with
reservations
he
turned
his
attention
to
the
man
behind
the
plasticene
desk
nor
had
his
other
probings
taken
more
than
a
few
seconds
he
noted
with
interest
the
round
smooth
face
the
slightly
greenish
eyes
the
silver
hair
that
seemed
finer
and
silkier
than
any
hanlon
had
ever
seen
on
a
human
being
it
was
almost
like
fine
fur
he
thought
suddenly
then
he
got
a
shock
this
man
was
different
hanlon
could
not
touch
that
mind
at
all
there
was
a
sort
of
an
an
alien
feeling
there
he
could
not
quite
fathom
it
was
like
no
other
mind
he
had
ever
tried
to
read
but
he
was
careful
not
to
let
his
face
show
anything
of
his
inner
thoughts
as
he
saluted
them
gravely
after
that
first
brief
pause
then
suddenly
he
made
his
face
show
a
boyish
enthusiasm
almost
a
naivete
maybe
panek
has
already
told
you
about
me
i
looking
for
a
chance
to
make
a
flock
of
credits
and
i
not
too
particular
how
i
get
but
his
mind
was
tense
and
anxious
what
was
their
game
and
this
fellow
behind
the
desk
this
leader
who
was
he
hanlon
knew
he
would
have
a
real
job
finding
out
those
answers
but
knew
he
must
the
leader
nodded
suavely
that
is
a
very
uh
commendable
desire
he
said
in
a
low
gentle
voice
that
was
a
perfect
match
for
his
outward
appearance
of
high
gentility
we
can
always
use
a
good
man
he
continued
who
is
afraid
nor
too
squeamish
a
hanlon
shrugged
if
it
pays
well
okay
the
man
seemed
to
recoil
his
delicate
hands
fluttering
in
the
air
almost
femininely
no
no
my
dear
young
man
you
misunderstood
me
entirely
we
do
nothing
so
crude
so
vulgar
so
so
brutal
oh
sometimes
we
uh
sometimes
an
accident
happens
to
someone
but
nothing
you
understand
that
we
have
anything
to
do
with
your
technique
with
the
poor
abrams
who
was
so
suddenly
taken
ill
had
led
me
to
hope
you
had
more
finesse
i
beg
your
pardon
hanlon
tone
was
now
one
of
apology
i
can
finesse
all
right
but
i
did
know
you
wanted
me
to
talk
that
way
in
private
i
remember
and
respect
your
wishes
from
now
on
inwardly
he
was
puzzled
he
kept
trying
to
touch
that
mind
but
could
not
was
the
guy
human
or
did
he
have
a
of
some
sort
was
he
used
to
so
that
he
had
developed
a
defense
against
it
or
and
hanlon
almost
caught
his
breath
in
momentary
fear
was
this
ape
a
mind
reader
a
real
one
not
a
dub
like
himself
but
the
leader
was
answering
still
in
that
gentle
tone
as
though
nothing
had
happened
so
so
that
is
good
i
hate
the
thought
of
bloodshed
and
i
will
not
countenance
roughness
in
actions
or
speech
it
is
regrettable
of
course
that
sometimes
men
are
stupid
enough
to
oppose
us
but
and
again
that
almost
feminine
gesture
this
was
the
silkiest
slimiest
george
hanlon
had
ever
encountered
and
again
his
heart
quailed
for
the
moment
if
i
was
on
my
own
he
shuddered
inwardly
i
sure
never
team
up
with
a
guy
like
that
for
there
was
no
single
iota
of
mercy
or
compassion
in
that
mind
behind
that
gentle
face
of
that
hanlon
was
sure
there
was
a
long
pregnant
moment
of
silence
while
the
five
men
studied
hanlon
more
carefully
finally
the
man
behind
the
desk
spoke
more
slowly
perhaps
just
perhaps
you
understand
and
nothing
definite
as
yet
we
may
have
a
little
job
for
you
before
long
on
another
planet
you
have
no
objections
to
travel
not
if
there
a
bundle
of
the
stuff
at
the
end
of
the
trip
no
hanlon
grinned
avariciously
but
his
mind
was
seeking
answers
why
did
they
want
to
send
him
away
was
this
a
job
or
a
trap
should
he
go
to
some
other
planet
would
he
thus
get
best
leads
perhaps
if
it
was
for
too
long
a
time
of
course
the
leader
smiled
suddenly
while
hanlon
was
thus
thinking
and
the
rest
grinned
as
though
they
had
been
waiting
for
his
lead
to
relax
their
vigilance
there
will
be
a
very
large
uh
bundle
he
paused
a
moment
then
continued
we
need
more
overseers
on
a
certain
planet
it
is
one
that
is
rich
in
various
metals
the
natives
mine
it
under
our
direction
and
hanlon
interrupted
i
do
know
a
thing
about
mining
will
that
make
a
difference
here
he
thought
swiftly
was
the
test
if
they
still
wanted
him
and
had
a
reasonable
answer
it
might
well
be
a
job
none
at
all
the
leader
smiled
again
we
have
mining
engineers
in
charge
your
job
would
be
merely
to
keep
the
natives
working
at
top
speed
it
is
uh
unfortunate
that
they
are
high
enough
in
the
cultural
scale
so
we
can
not
under
the
snyder
dictum
colonize
their
planet
and
work
it
ourselves
but
we
will
chan
he
broke
off
as
though
realizing
he
was
saying
too
much
and
hanlon
stiffened
inwardly
this
was
a
real
clue
what
planet
was
the
man
talking
about
his
most
penetrant
could
not
get
the
answer
from
any
of
the
minds
there
to
the
others
it
was
merely
a
planet
nothing
more
and
this
ape
with
his
perfect
mental
control
let
nothing
leak
but
the
leader
had
caught
himself
and
gone
on
almost
as
though
there
had
been
no
break
chance
using
you
i
think
if
so
your
salary
will
be
a
thousand
credits
a
month
plus
all
expenses
and
a
nice
bonus
every
so
often
depending
on
how
little
trouble
you
have
with
your
crew
and
how
much
ore
they
take
out
hanlon
showed
that
gleam
of
avarice
again
sounds
very
interesting
then
he
leaned
forward
one
more
thing
how
long
does
the
job
last
for
several
years
if
you
want
it
and
if
we
continue
to
be
satisfied
with
you
but
we
bring
the
men
back
every
few
months
for
a
vacation
we
find
that
best
with
most
of
them
the
climate
there
is
not
too
pleasant
and
the
conditions
are
confining
nothing
to
do
but
work
eh
just
about
that
the
shifts
are
about
eight
hours
of
our
time
and
between
them
you
eat
sleep
read
or
play
cards
but
you
do
not
explore
or
anything
like
that
the
ship
goes
there
every
three
weeks
and
we
usually
figure
eighteen
weeks
there
then
the
three
weeks
back
here
the
guards
and
others
rotate
that
way
they
have
a
tendency
to
uh
deteriorate
if
we
do
hanlon
let
himself
shiver
but
grinned
as
he
did
so
now
that
one
thing
i
do
want
to
do
go
nuts
ca
make
any
credits
doing
that
the
leader
raised
his
hand
you
understand
of
course
there
will
be
a
short
period
of
uh
checking
and
testing
before
we
decide
to
send
you
out
on
a
job
hanlon
voice
was
almost
servile
yet
confident
sure
sir
you
name
it
i
do
it
he
was
still
probing
with
everything
he
had
but
still
getting
nothing
important
a
couple
of
the
men
seemed
to
be
chuckling
about
what
might
happen
to
him
if
he
failed
the
tests
but
he
had
guessed
that
much
anyway
suddenly
the
leader
leaned
across
the
desk
and
his
genteel
manner
slipped
from
him
like
a
discarded
mask
his
eyes
became
glacial
ice
do
get
any
grandiose
ideas
in
your
head
hanlon
we
are
not
fools
nor
are
we
offering
you
a
chance
to
get
in
on
our
complete
plans
i
am
just
possibly
hiring
you
to
do
a
simple
job
oh
no
sir
i
was
even
thinking
of
such
a
thing
hanlon
looked
hurt
why
i
just
a
kid
i
know
i
could
expect
anything
else
at
first
not
until
i
proved
myself
to
you
or
until
made
my
pile
and
got
in
a
position
of
power
then
naturally
i
want
to
get
into
something
where
i
could
really
go
places
but
that
for
years
and
years
ahead
i
know
that
the
cold
eyes
scrutinized
him
carefully
but
still
doubtfully
when
the
leader
spoke
his
voice
was
more
cordial
though
still
harder
not
soft
as
it
had
been
at
first
i
be
frank
hanlon
we
not
too
sure
of
you
yet
because
you
were
a
cadet
oh
we
know
as
hanlon
started
to
protest
hotly
all
about
your
being
kicked
out
we
can
see
how
all
that
might
well
have
soured
you
enough
so
you
will
really
do
anything
you
can
to
get
ahead
even
if
only
to
show
the
corps
but
you
can
understand
our
hesitation
i
think
of
course
sir
but
you
need
worry
he
made
his
voice
as
bitter
and
hard
as
he
could
i
had
my
fill
of
all
that
law
and
order
stuff
i
was
an
innocent
young
punk
full
of
high
ideals
and
the
romance
of
the
corps
and
all
that
bunk
but
those
mangy
knocked
all
that
out
of
me
anything
i
can
do
that
give
a
kick
in
the
teeth
do
with
joy
and
gusto
fine
words
snapped
the
leader
but
can
you
take
it
if
the
going
gets
tough
hanlon
was
learning
fast
now
he
stared
straight
back
into
those
hard
eyes
can
you
dish
it
out
mister
his
tone
was
almost
but
not
quite
insolent
chapter
a
black
look
suffused
the
leader
face
at
hanlon
impertinent
can
you
dish
it
out
mister
he
from
his
seat
while
the
other
four
men
reached
quick
hands
towards
their
weapons
then
slowly
the
man
sank
back
relaxed
and
smiled
an
open
friendly
smile
of
genuine
cordiality
and
his
men
also
relaxed
you
do
hanlon
by
the
great
uh
zeus
you
do
but
he
added
significantly
i
think
you
will
find
that
i
can
it
out
as
you
call
it
if
the
need
ever
arises
you
had
better
pray
it
never
does
fair
enough
hanlon
shrugged
indifferently
the
boys
will
take
you
out
and
show
you
the
town
if
you
like
the
leader
smiled
engagingly
they
will
get
word
to
you
when
i
have
a
job
ready
which
may
be
in
a
day
or
two
hanlon
thanked
him
and
felt
it
policy
to
go
out
with
the
boys
even
though
he
did
not
particularly
care
to
do
so
nor
did
he
especially
enjoy
the
night
that
followed
he
had
left
a
ten
call
with
the
hotel
visiphone
operator
when
he
got
back
to
the
hotel
at
last
when
she
called
he
groggily
opened
one
eye
half
way
and
fumbled
for
the
ten
of
a
fine
morning
mr
hanlon
oh
no
he
groaned
oh
yes
she
giggled
that
bad
is
it
that
but
thanks
anyway
i
guess
she
was
laughing
heartily
as
she
disconnected
hanlon
groaned
with
the
utter
misery
of
a
throbbing
head
the
sunlight
pouring
through
an
open
window
directly
into
his
eyes
did
not
help
any
he
rolled
over
petulantly
but
knew
he
had
to
get
up
he
stumbled
out
of
bed
and
went
in
to
stand
under
a
cold
shower
ten
minutes
later
he
began
to
feel
a
little
more
human
and
decided
maybe
he
would
live
after
all
never
again
he
swore
fervently
i
just
not
cut
out
for
serious
drinking
hope
i
did
give
anything
away
to
those
guys
last
night
he
dressed
slowly
meanwhile
striving
as
best
his
aching
head
would
let
him
to
review
his
situation
he
was
fairly
well
pleased
with
his
success
to
date
but
the
grue
of
fear
was
still
with
him
he
was
getting
part
way
where
he
wanted
to
be
but
this
was
certainly
no
picnic
he
was
muscling
into
he
remembered
his
father
injunction
to
take
it
easy
at
first
and
grimaced
wrily
eating
breakfast
in
the
hotel
dining
room
after
taking
an
effervescent
to
relieve
his
headache
he
tried
to
plan
his
next
moves
there
much
he
could
do
he
decided
until
they
called
him
he
had
made
his
bid
it
would
do
to
try
to
push
himself
too
much
or
it
would
look
mighty
fishy
to
those
sharp
minds
he
shuddered
again
involuntarily
thinking
about
that
enigmatic
leader
who
or
what
was
he
hanlon
went
first
to
the
bank
and
made
out
a
card
for
his
own
box
but
once
in
the
vault
and
the
attendant
gone
out
it
was
box
he
opened
there
was
a
note
for
him
welcome
to
simonides
he
read
my
name
here
is
art
georgopoulis
i
work
at
present
as
a
bartender
at
the
golden
web
on
thermopylae
street
the
in
the
underworld
hang
out
there
and
i
pick
up
occasional
bits
of
news
if
you
come
in
introduce
yourself
by
asking
for
good
old
kentucky
practically
no
one
ever
asks
for
those
the
blond
skinny
one
at
the
far
end
of
the
bar
if
i
can
be
of
any
help
just
yell
me
i
have
got
to
first
check
station
yet
but
still
in
there
punching
hope
you
do
better
curt
hooper
hanlon
ate
the
note
then
wrote
one
of
his
own
telling
what
he
had
learned
to
date
what
he
suspicioned
and
what
he
was
trying
to
do
of
his
new
mental
powers
he
said
nothing
he
did
not
distrust
this
ss
man
of
course
but
if
the
fellow
did
know
he
could
be
made
to
tell
as
hanlon
left
the
bank
he
began
to
get
the
feeling
he
was
being
trailed
but
could
not
seem
to
locate
anyone
doing
it
although
he
did
not
dare
search
to
his
rear
very
carefully
neither
could
he
catch
any
definite
thoughts
about
such
a
thing
from
among
the
welter
of
on
the
crowded
streets
he
wandered
about
most
of
the
day
frankly
but
his
mind
was
always
open
he
went
into
various
public
buildings
sat
for
some
time
in
one
or
another
of
the
numerous
parks
whenever
he
felt
a
bit
tired
of
walking
that
feeling
of
being
watched
made
him
cautious
so
he
did
not
practice
much
with
his
on
any
of
the
birds
he
did
however
make
a
trip
to
the
local
zoo
and
as
he
paused
momentarily
in
front
of
each
of
the
cages
to
look
at
the
exhibit
it
contained
he
briefly
made
an
excursion
into
the
mind
of
each
different
type
of
animal
bird
or
rodent
outside
of
minor
differences
of
texture
they
all
seemed
about
the
same
each
of
them
had
naturally
different
muscular
abilities
that
would
need
considerable
study
if
he
ever
intended
using
one
of
them
and
every
minute
he
was
seeking
searching
for
any
tiniest
thread
of
evidence
as
to
what
it
was
that
was
causing
this
undercurrent
of
secret
intrigue
that
was
so
plainly
evident
to
his
mind
but
there
was
no
factual
data
to
be
learned
only
that
feel
of
it
in
the
very
air
yet
as
the
day
wore
on
he
came
to
believe
that
much
or
most
of
what
he
sensed
was
not
that
plot
which
was
causing
the
corps
concern
rather
it
seemed
more
as
though
all
the
people
here
were
engaged
in
some
sort
of
secret
aggressiveness
and
it
was
finally
forced
into
his
consciousness
that
it
was
business
not
politics
for
it
was
that
simonides
even
though
it
had
become
the
federation
wealthiest
world
was
not
yet
satisfied
that
its
merchants
and
traders
wanted
to
capture
more
and
still
more
of
the
system
business
there
were
far
too
many
minds
engaged
in
aggressive
thoughts
for
a
political
revolution
he
felt
sure
if
it
was
this
surely
others
of
the
corps
of
the
secret
service
would
have
found
out
something
definite
about
it
no
whatever
this
was
it
distinctly
was
not
what
he
was
here
to
find
the
feeling
that
he
was
being
spied
upon
was
always
more
or
less
present
but
he
could
not
spot
the
man
or
men
who
were
watching
him
either
several
were
working
in
short
shifts
or
else
the
trailer
kept
so
far
behind
him
that
the
multiplicity
of
thoughts
from
the
hundreds
of
people
always
around
masked
those
of
the
spy
hanlon
ate
a
leisurely
lunch
in
a
small
restaurant
and
during
the
afternoon
continued
his
if
they
were
shadowing
him
they
would
have
nothing
to
report
he
grinned
not
during
the
day
at
least
what
the
evening
would
bring
forth
would
perhaps
be
another
matter
for
he
had
determined
to
at
least
get
in
touch
with
the
ss
man
who
had
written
that
note
he
would
have
dinner
at
the
golden
web
if
they
served
meals
if
not
he
would
have
a
drink
anyway
the
two
men
certainly
should
know
each
other
by
sight
he
went
briefly
to
the
hotel
but
there
had
been
no
calls
for
him
so
he
took
a
to
the
cafe
which
turned
out
to
be
a
pretentious
garish
one
inside
he
made
his
way
to
that
part
of
the
long
busy
bar
presided
over
by
a
slim
blond
man
hanlon
climbed
onto
a
stool
gim
me
a
good
old
kentucky
suh
he
demanded
an
be
doggoned
suah
it
made
right
the
bartender
eyed
him
peculiarly
where
this
kentucky
and
what
a
on
terra
of
course
where
i
came
from
where
you
think
it
was
on
andromeda
seven
pardon
me
sir
i
seem
to
remember
now
having
heard
of
such
a
drink
i
have
to
look
it
up
in
the
i
disremember
the
ingredients
hanlon
grinned
and
lost
his
appearance
of
truculence
it
partly
made
of
blue
grass
like
a
neck
but
if
it
too
much
trouble
just
give
me
a
cola
the
barkeep
grinned
too
i
gotcha
steve
and
poured
out
the
soft
drink
hanlon
sat
sipping
his
innocuous
drink
looking
about
him
quietly
a
crowd
was
beginning
to
fill
the
place
evidently
fairly
prosperous
people
but
he
could
see
that
they
were
not
the
real
but
the
climbers
his
drink
finished
hanlon
signalled
his
friendly
barman
the
grub
here
any
good
this
looks
like
a
nice
place
yes
it
is
one
often
hears
some
interesting
things
here
as
for
the
food
it
is
very
good
and
not
too
expensive
they
have
a
native
fowl
much
like
chicken
i
think
you
like
ask
for
in
whatever
style
you
like
it
fixed
glad
to
be
of
service
sir
any
time
in
any
way
the
last
words
were
slightly
emphasized
hanlon
had
ordered
and
was
waiting
for
his
food
when
a
man
he
had
never
seen
before
slipped
into
the
seat
opposite
him
the
boss
wants
to
see
you
yeah
hanlon
looked
him
up
and
down
almost
contemptuously
just
who
is
this
who
interested
in
me
cut
the
clowning
you
know
who
at
the
bacchus
now
so
hanlon
let
himself
appear
slightly
interested
well
after
i
get
through
eating
if
nothing
else
shows
up
to
interest
me
more
i
might
drop
over
you
better
and
mighty
quick
too
the
man
snapped
although
it
was
apparent
he
was
puzzled
by
hanlon
manner
he
do
like
to
be
kept
waiting
and
i
do
like
to
be
hurried
or
ordered
about
hanlon
snapped
back
if
i
come
and
notice
i
said
i
be
there
in
about
an
hour
now
do
you
mind
i
like
to
enjoy
my
food
the
man
rose
still
with
that
perplexed
expression
it
was
evident
he
was
not
used
to
people
not
jumping
when
his
boss
issued
invitations
which
were
really
commands
he
shook
his
head
slowly
i
hope
for
your
sake
he
in
a
good
humor
he
said
as
he
left
hanlon
mind
was
not
too
easy
as
he
ate
swiftly
and
his
relish
of
the
excellent
food
was
not
as
keen
as
it
might
have
been
but
for
this
interruption
he
shivered
remembering
that
cold
ruthlessness
he
had
sensed
behind
that
leader
suave
manner
but
he
had
to
play
out
his
string
as
a
somewhat
brash
youngster
who
was
afraid
of
anybody
or
anything
he
had
made
a
clean
score
with
that
reckless
can
you
dish
it
out
mister
but
he
had
better
not
press
his
luck
too
far
thus
it
was
only
about
half
an
hour
later
when
he
presented
himself
at
the
bacchus
you
took
your
time
coming
the
leader
looked
at
hanlon
curiously
i
was
hungry
hanlon
answered
simply
i
just
ordered
dinner
when
your
message
was
delivered
i
came
as
soon
as
i
finished
those
who
work
for
me
usually
uh
come
running
when
i
call
hanlon
grinned
wolfishly
maybe
they
afraid
of
you
and
you
are
should
i
be
i
do
like
impudence
or
insolence
the
voice
was
more
curt
and
the
eyes
lost
some
of
their
calmness
in
a
flash
of
anger
hanlon
knew
he
had
gone
far
enough
for
the
time
being
so
instantly
became
less
brash
more
apologetic
if
i
take
your
job
if
you
offer
me
one
sir
i
obey
all
orders
promptly
and
i
give
you
everything
i
got
naturally
but
i
not
one
of
your
snivelling
toadies
the
leader
regarded
him
once
more
with
silent
appraisal
in
which
a
measure
of
respect
or
at
least
approval
seemed
to
show
hanlon
probing
the
other
minds
present
was
secretly
amused
at
their
astonishment
at
his
temerity
and
the
fact
that
he
was
getting
away
with
it
after
long
moments
the
leader
nodded
his
head
as
though
he
had
reached
a
decision
what
were
you
doing
in
the
bank
this
morning
why
just
depositing
some
of
my
stuff
in
a
safety
deposit
box
he
said
surprised
why
how
did
you
get
your
own
box
so
quickly
what
do
you
mean
so
quickly
i
went
in
yesterday
and
asked
if
one
was
available
and
the
girl
clerk
signed
me
up
for
it
and
said
i
could
get
entry
today
oh
i
see
i
was
told
it
was
done
like
you
already
had
a
box
and
uh
wondered
about
it
hanlon
reached
in
his
pocket
and
threw
a
key
onto
the
desk
go
look
in
it
for
yourself
if
you
think
it
important
and
incidentally
he
said
contemptuously
i
known
all
day
long
i
was
being
shadowed
but
was
instantly
sorry
he
had
said
that
last
for
there
came
a
deadly
coldness
in
the
leader
tone
and
a
gleam
in
those
hard
eyes
that
boded
ill
for
someone
i
see
well
let
it
pass
he
pushed
the
key
back
toward
hanlon
who
pocketed
it
thankfully
his
bluff
had
worked
this
was
the
key
to
his
own
box
of
course
his
master
key
was
in
a
hidden
pocket
in
the
cuff
of
his
trousers
the
leader
sank
back
into
his
chair
and
was
silent
for
long
minutes
thinking
deeply
while
hanlon
waited
patiently
still
trying
to
get
some
glimmering
of
thought
from
that
unreadable
mind
still
frustrated
almost
to
the
point
of
despair
that
he
could
finally
the
man
spoke
but
not
to
hanlon
panek
you
and
the
others
go
find
rellos
and
bring
him
here
when
they
were
alone
the
leader
leaned
forward
and
spoke
earnestly
to
hanlon
yet
watching
him
carefully
as
he
did
so
i
like
you
hanlon
and
i
going
to
test
you
out
i
am
not
too
sure
of
you
yet
but
if
i
become
so
you
can
go
far
very
very
far
with
me
this
rellos
i
sent
for
is
the
man
who
was
shadowing
you
today
i
can
not
i
he
spat
venomously
abide
failure
or
incompetence
i
am
assigning
you
the
pleasant
little
task
of
seeing
that
some
sort
of
an
uh
accident
happens
to
rellos
and
as
i
think
about
it
it
might
as
well
be
a
uh
permanent
one
hanlon
stomach
curled
up
so
tightly
it
hurt
but
he
strove
manfully
not
to
let
his
feelings
show
in
his
face
he
had
an
instant
inkling
of
what
the
proposal
was
going
to
be
and
it
was
a
measure
of
his
stability
that
he
succeeded
in
keeping
his
mask
up
he
knew
starkly
that
this
time
he
would
have
to
go
through
with
a
killing
or
else
give
up
this
line
of
research
for
he
knew
that
if
he
did
not
kill
this
man
this
way
was
closed
to
him
and
if
he
dropped
out
but
gave
the
tip
to
some
other
ss
man
that
one
would
eventually
face
the
same
sort
of
a
task
so
much
as
it
sickened
him
even
to
contemplate
it
it
now
became
a
he
would
have
to
think
of
himself
as
a
soldier
in
war
and
rellos
an
enemy
outwardly
calm
he
shrugged
indifferently
any
guy
that
ca
produce
is
worth
keeping
he
said
any
special
way
you
want
it
done
no
i
think
i
would
like
to
see
how
you
work
plan
it
yourself
but
if
it
is
done
you
had
better
not
let
me
or
my
men
see
you
again
fair
enough
if
i
ca
do
a
simple
job
like
that
i
sure
ca
be
of
enough
value
to
you
to
do
myself
any
real
good
they
were
silent
again
but
hanlon
mind
was
bleak
with
what
was
to
come
he
was
the
killer
type
he
believed
in
the
sacredness
of
human
life
yet
he
knew
he
would
have
to
steel
himself
to
go
through
with
it
the
job
was
more
important
than
one
man
life
but
to
kill
in
cold
blood
a
deliberate
murder
just
then
panek
returned
with
a
slender
man
ah
rellos
the
leader
greeted
him
i
want
you
to
meet
a
new
member
of
our
group
george
hanlon
he
has
just
come
from
terra
and
has
never
been
on
simonides
before
i
would
like
you
to
take
him
out
and
show
him
new
athens
and
what
it
contains
in
the
way
of
pleasures
you
can
turn
in
an
account
of
your
expenses
tomorrow
and
thought
hanlon
was
just
about
as
low
and
slimy
a
trick
as
he
had
ever
heard
and
the
thought
came
and
would
not
be
denied
that
if
it
was
this
leader
he
was
to
kill
he
could
do
it
cheerfully
and
with
a
clear
conscience
he
rose
though
and
smiled
as
he
held
out
his
hand
glad
to
know
you
rellos
it
be
fun
comparing
your
amusements
with
those
of
terra
the
man
was
somewhat
sullen
although
it
was
plain
he
did
not
dare
show
it
too
much
before
their
boss
hanlon
could
read
enough
from
the
new
man
mind
to
know
how
deathly
afraid
he
was
of
the
leader
and
how
he
hated
him
wonder
why
he
in
this
feeling
that
way
hanlon
thought
swiftly
and
during
the
evening
tried
to
find
out
but
without
success
the
man
steered
clear
of
any
such
thoughts
as
the
two
went
outside
the
simonidean
asked
curtly
wine
women
or
song
why
not
some
of
all
three
hanlon
laughed
lightly
anything
you
think
would
be
a
lively
evening
and
that
you
enjoy
the
other
unbent
a
little
we
go
to
the
phobos
first
then
they
have
good
liquor
and
a
nice
floor
show
good
looking
wenches
who
wear
too
much
he
hailed
a
which
the
two
entered
hanlon
could
enjoy
that
evening
in
the
first
place
he
ditch
all
his
drinks
and
he
hated
alcohol
yet
had
to
remain
as
sober
as
possible
second
and
most
disturbing
was
that
horrible
thing
he
had
to
do
and
he
knew
it
must
be
carefully
planned
a
gun
knife
or
poison
could
be
used
now
it
must
look
so
much
like
an
accident
that
no
possible
blame
could
be
attached
to
him
so
that
the
police
could
not
hold
him
even
for
a
short
time
he
thought
of
and
discarded
one
plan
after
another
then
remembered
something
seen
during
his
wanderings
a
pedestrian
bridge
crossing
a
truckway
where
the
freighters
were
so
numerous
they
ran
almost
bumper
to
bumper
i
lead
him
up
there
then
throw
him
over
and
down
he
sure
to
be
run
over
and
killed
the
nakedness
of
the
girls
at
the
phobos
the
coarse
jokes
of
the
comedians
the
raucous
ribald
laughter
of
the
drunken
patrons
disgusted
hanlon
and
he
was
glad
when
they
left
let
walk
a
bit
and
see
the
sights
he
suggested
and
rellos
agreed
after
some
argument
he
wanted
to
visit
more
night
clubs
they
had
walked
a
couple
of
blocks
along
a
residential
street
when
a
little
puppy
waddled
out
onto
the
sidewalk
to
greet
them
what
a
cute
hanlon
began
but
with
an
oath
rellos
savagely
and
viciously
kicked
the
little
mite
sending
it
howling
with
pain
across
the
low
hedge
a
growl
of
anguish
broke
out
and
hanlon
sent
his
mind
searching
for
that
deeper
note
he
found
it
the
mother
dog
and
was
instantly
inside
that
mind
controlling
it
with
a
leap
the
huge
shepherd
was
over
the
hedge
straight
at
rellos
the
dog
weight
bore
the
man
backward
fighting
for
his
life
trying
to
hold
back
those
gleaming
fangs
straining
for
his
throat
hanlon
threw
himself
into
the
melee
but
while
ostensibly
trying
to
drag
the
dog
away
delayed
the
few
seconds
it
took
for
those
slashing
fangs
to
rip
out
rellos
throat
people
came
running
up
and
as
the
first
reached
the
spot
they
saw
hanlon
struggling
to
hold
back
the
snarling
dog
while
rellos
lay
dead
in
a
pool
of
blood
the
dog
owner
rushed
up
and
snapped
a
leash
on
the
dog
i
terribly
sorry
sir
hanlon
said
my
companion
was
drunk
and
kicked
her
puppy
she
merely
avenged
it
i
wondered
the
man
was
shaken
kaiserina
never
was
vicious
before
i
do
think
she
will
be
again
hanlon
said
soothingly
is
the
puppy
all
right
he
asked
the
small
boy
who
came
up
with
the
little
animal
cradled
in
his
arms
no
the
boy
sobbed
fluffy
dead
what
going
on
here
an
authoritative
voice
said
and
two
policemen
pushed
their
way
through
the
crowd
the
dog
owner
explained
in
swift
words
and
completely
exonerated
hanlon
this
man
tried
to
stop
my
dog
he
was
holding
her
back
when
i
got
here
and
others
corroborated
his
statement
you
better
have
the
dog
killed
the
policeman
said
but
hanlon
intervened
no
she
was
just
striking
back
at
the
man
who
killed
her
puppy
she
was
to
blame
and
i
sure
she
is
vicious
the
police
were
finally
satisfied
and
while
they
were
calling
the
hanlon
walked
slowly
back
to
his
hotel
his
heart
still
sick
but
consoled
a
bit
he
had
it
coming
to
him
his
thought
was
bitter
the
rotten
beast
kicking
a
little
puppy
like
that
chapter
the
next
evening
hanlon
went
back
to
the
bacchus
instead
of
stopping
at
the
bar
he
went
directly
to
the
back
room
and
knocked
on
the
door
when
the
peephole
opened
he
asked
the
boss
in
nope
i
got
a
report
to
make
wait
at
the
bar
i
get
in
touch
a
quarter
hour
later
the
man
summoned
him
and
upon
entering
that
room
hanlon
saw
a
closet
door
was
standing
open
disclosing
a
visiphone
screen
on
which
the
leader
face
was
visible
well
yep
ah
there
was
a
quick
intake
of
breath
and
a
feral
gleam
in
those
greenish
eyes
a
moment
silence
then
do
you
still
want
that
overseer
job
for
a
thousand
a
month
and
keep
definitely
very
well
we
try
you
zeller
will
give
you
a
list
of
things
need
there

clothing
and
such
uh
got
any
money
to
buy
those
you
do
have
i
will
have
when
you
pay
me
rellos
expense
money
for
last
night
the
leader
eyes
narrowed
in
sudden
anger
do
try
my
patience
too
far
hanlon
okay
hanlon
shrugged
indifferently
but
i
never
figured
you
for
a
cheapskate
there
was
a
gasp
as
though
the
leader
was
amazed
at
hanlon
temerity
but
he
quickly
gained
control
of
himself
and
an
instant
later
began
smiling
then
grinning
and
finally
laughing
aloud
at
himself
by
zeus
hanlon
i
like
you
nobody
else
ever
dared
talk
up
to
me
like
that
you
win
tell
zeller
no
put
him
on
i
tell
him
zeller
give
hanlon
the
list
of
things
needed
for
the
job
and
pay
him
a
hundred
credits
charged
to
the
fund
tell
him
to
be
here
all
packed
to
go
at
thirteen
he
started
to
turn
the
set
off
then
as
he
heard
hanlon
ask
anything
else
now
faced
the
screen
again
not
unless
you
want
to
make
rounds
with
the
boys
again
it
will
be
some
time
before
you
can
have
any
hanlon
made
a
sign
of
distaste
and
shook
his
head
thanks
two
in
a
row
will
last
me
for
plenty
time
i
go
get
some
the
leader
smiled
companionably
the
rest
might
be
best
for
have
a
rather
rough
trip
you
ride
a
freighter
not
a
luxury
liner
do
i
ask
where
i
going
does
it
matter
hanlon
shrugged
not
especially
just
curiosity
then
it
wo
particularly
bother
you
if
we
uh
keep
your
destination
a
secret
for
a
while
not
in
the
least
if
you
want
it
that
way
he
yawned
indifferently
but
his
mind
was
so
anxious
he
had
trouble
not
letting
it
show
in
his
face
or
eyes
how
was
he
to
get
that
location
he
thought
swiftly
and
conceived
a
possibility
your
bar
here
serve
cola
what
is
that
a
soft
drink
very
popular
on
terra
and
many
other
planets
i
like
to
take
a
case
with
me
if
it
allowed
i
see
no
reason
against
it
i
never
heard
of
it
but
you
might
ask
the
bargirls
i
can
get
it
at
the
golden
web
if
you
do
have
it
here
i
had
some
there
the
other
night
he
watched
carefully
but
there
was
no
sign
of
suspicion
the
leader
did
not
even
seem
interested
hanlon
blanked
the
screen
got
the
list
and
money
from
zeller
and
walked
out
the
bacchus
did
not
stock
cola
so
he
took
a
to
the
golden
web
pretending
he
walked
in
and
ordered
the
case
of
drink
from
his
colleague
while
drinking
a
glass
of
it
he
talked
in
more
or
less
garrulous
tones
in
between
unimportant
words
he
informed
the
ss
man
bartender
that
he
was
leaving
the
next
noon
for
another
planet
whose
name
and
location
he
had
yet
been
able
to
learn
got
a
good
boss
though
he
mumbled
thickly
very
good
boss
sure
he
knows
a
lot
headquarters
at
the
bacchus
hooper
quick
of
understanding
as
all
ss
men
have
to
be
merely
said
aloud
the
conventional
safe
flights
but
hanlon
knew
he
would
do
everything
he
could
to
get
that
planetary
information
and
hanlon
was
well
content
as
he
went
to
the
hotel
and
to
bed
what
could
be
done
had
been
done
as
soon
as
he
had
breakfasted
the
next
morning
hanlon
checked
out
of
his
hotel
then
went
out
and
purchased
the
special
clothing
and
other
items
on
his
list
with
everything
packed
in
traveling
cases
he
presented
himself
at
the
bacchus
just
before
thirteen
as
he
got
out
of
the
cab
and
gave
orders
to
the
doorman
about
keeping
his
luggage
until
he
was
ready
to
leave
hanlon
was
heartened
to
see
hooper
apparently
reading
a
newsheet
leaning
against
the
nearby
in
the
back
room
the
leader
and
three
others
including
the
ubiquitous
panek
were
waiting
for
him
he
was
handed
an
envelope
when
you
arrive
give
these
credentials
to
peter
philander
the
superintendent
he
will
be
your
boss
there
just
do
as
he
says
get
nosey
about
what
is
going
on
and
you
will
do
all
right
do
worry
about
my
keeping
my
nose
clean
i
taking
along
a
dozen
extra
hankies
his
last
doubts
about
leaving
simonides
to
go
to
the
unknown
planet
were
now
at
rest
he
was
sure
that
there
he
would
find
the
leads
he
so
desperately
needed
and
probably
only
there
could
he
get
them
they
picked
up
his
luggage
then
all
got
into
a
large
black
and
as
it
started
the
men
lowered
curtains
over
the
windows
and
while
hanlon
was
wondering
about
that
one
of
them
pinned
his
arms
suddenly
to
his
side
while
another
slapped
a
piece
of
adhesive
across
his
eyes
smoothing
it
tightly
into
place
hanlon
gasped
but
did
not
struggle
that
right
do
fight
it
the
leader
voice
was
almost
kind
we
just
do
want
you
knowing
where
we
are
going
yet
the
car
travelled
some
miles
then
stopped
and
they
all
got
out
the
men
helped
hanlon
down
led
him
a
few
dozen
steps
then
helped
him
climb
into
another
machine
in
a
moment
he
realized
they
were
now
in
an
aircar
that
had
taken
off
and
he
frowned
assuming
that
hooper
had
followed
he
be
out
of
it
now
he
was
on
his
own
for
several
moments
hanlon
tried
in
vain
to
read
from
the
others
minds
where
they
were
going
he
had
almost
given
up
hope
when
he
heard
the
unmistakable
panting
of
a
small
dog
and
realized
that
one
of
the
air
crew
must
have
brought
a
pet
quickly
his
mind
contacted
that
of
the
dog
and
instantly
was
inside
it
looking
out
through
the
dog
eyes
he
controlled
its
mind
so
that
it
climbed
up
in
the
man
lap
and
with
its
forepaws
on
the
shoulder
looked
out
of
the
aircar
window
no
one
seemed
to
find
anything
peculiar
in
the
dog
actions
its
owner
merely
patting
it
as
it
stood
there
as
hanlon
could
feel
through
the
dog
senses
now
hanlon
could
see
they
were
nearing
some
mountains
and
took
particular
notice
of
everything
that
might
be
remembered
as
a
landmark
soon
they
were
settling
down
into
a
little
hidden
valley
where
there
was
a
fairly
large
they
led
him
into
this
ship
and
he
lost
the
dog
so
could
not
see
just
where
they
were
taking
him
finally
he
sensed
they
were
in
a
small
room
and
the
adhesive
was
ripped
from
his
face
the
leader
and
panek
stood
in
the
small
cabin
with
hanlon
this
is
to
be
your
cabin
sorry
for
the
precautions
but
you
can
see
why
i
am
sure
but
if
you
behave
and
make
a
good
record
you
have
to
uh
worry
about
them
any
more
almost
immediately
so
we
have
to
leave
safe
flights
and
i
hope
you
make
out
all
right
he
looked
fixedly
at
hanlon
for
a
long
long
minute
and
the
young
man
returned
his
gaze
as
steadily
i
do
my
job
hanlon
said
honestly
after
that
moment
but
it
was
his
job
for
the
secret
service
he
meant
and
thanks
thank
you
too
panek
for
your
help
glad
to
done
it
pal
glad
to
see
you
in
four
months
then
and
the
two
left
hanlon
stored
his
luggage
in
the
racks
made
for
it
then
started
to
go
outside
and
see
what
was
going
on
but
the
door
was
locked
they
sure
do
want
me
to
know
where
we
going
he
grinned
ruefully
as
he
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
his
bunk
that
makes
me
know
important
and
i
get
it
some
day
they
ca
keep
it
from
me
forever
sirens
screamed
and
he
strapped
himself
into
his
bunk
when
he
felt
the
pressure
subside
and
knew
they
were
in
space
he
unstrapped
and
relaxed
but
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
later
there
was
the
sound
of
a
key
in
the
lock
when
the
door
opened
a
man
carrying
a
blaster
stepped
inside
stand
back
bud
and
keep
your
hands
in
sight
hanlon
raised
his
hands
while
the
messcook
brought
in
a
tray
and
set
it
on
his
bunk
as
they
were
going
out
hanlon
spoke
you
got
any
books
on
board
i
do
mind
being
locked
in
and
wo
make
any
trouble
but
please
give
me
something
to
do
they
made
no
answer
but
when
they
returned
for
the
empty
dishes
they
left
a
couple
of
magazines
late
the
following
afternoon
the
siren
warned
of
landing
and
hanlon
strapped
himself
down
again
after
he
had
felt
the
landing
one
of
the
ship
officers
came
and
unlocked
the
door
he
was
very
apologetic
sorry
sir
about
this
but
we
had
our
orders
it
okay
with
me
hanlon
said
cheerfully
do
make
a
bit
of
difference
with
me
where
i
am
long
i
get
well
paid
i
see
you
put
on
your
light
clothing
that
good
this
is
a
hot
planet
these
your
bags
hanlon
nodded
and
each
carrying
one
the
officer
led
the
way
to
the
airlock
and
they
climbed
down
onto
this
new
world
the
air
was
thick
and
muggy
at
least
fahrenheit
hanlon
guessed
there
was
a
great
bustle
of
activity
on
the
landing
field
automatic
machinery
was
unloading
cargo
and
loading
it
into
trucks
there
were
several
men
with
their
luggage
standing
about
one
was
a
huge
man
another
a
slender
young
chap
about
hanlon
own
age
apparently
from
his
manner
but
with
a
certain
shiftiness
in
his
eyes
the
others
laborers
any
of
you
been
here
before
the
officer
asked
two
of
the
others
nodded
and
started
away
from
the
field
hanlon
saw
that
just
beyond
the
edge
of
it
there
were
heavy
forests
almost
a
jungle
but
strange
and
alien
as
they
drew
nearer
and
finally
entered
it
the
young
ss
man
saw
that
this
was
indeed
unlike
any
jungle
or
forest
he
had
ever
seen
or
heard
about
tall
trees
whose
branches
writhed
as
though
alive
yet
never
attacked
one
underbrush
so
thick
it
seemed
impassable
yet
which
twisted
away
from
their
approach
as
though
afraid
of
a
contaminating
touch
only
to
swish
back
into
place
as
soon
as
the
men
passed
hanlon
walking
along
and
taking
it
all
in
seemed
to
catch
faint
whispers
of
thought
but
could
make
nothing
of
it
he
wondered
what
it
was
perhaps
some
alien
very
low
in
the
scale
the
ground
was
soft
and
mucky
the
young
checker
cautioned
the
others
do
step
off
the
path
some
of
this
stuff
almost
like
quicksand
there
a
road
to
the
mine
he
answered
hanlon
further
question
but
it
winding
and
about
five
miles
where
this
path
only
a
half
mile
ground
here
wo
stand
heavy
loads
how
big
is
this
planet
anyway
gravity
seems
about
like
simonides
and
terra
it
not
quite
as
large
but
seems
composed
mainly
of
heavier
metals
or
something
gravity
about
the
weather
stays
about
the
same
all
year
very
few
storms
of
any
kind
although
there
a
hot
rain
almost
every
night
for
about
half
an
hour
the
temperature
goes
down
to
about
at
night
up
to
days
no
wonder
they
told
me
to
buy
light
clothing
yeah
it
sure
hot
we
go
mostly
naked
except
the
actinic
really
fierce
be
sure
to
wear
a
hat
all
the
time
outdoors
and
light
gloves
if
your
eyes
start
to
smart
wear
dark
goggles
thanks
for
the
tips
chum
i
appreciate
i
begun
to
notice
skin
itching
but
thought
it
might
be
this
jungle
they
broke
through
the
final
wall
of
foliage
and
hanlon
saw
a
large
cleared
space
ahead
that
must
have
been
roughly
a
across
there
were
quite
a
number
of
buildings
mostly
windowless
and
he
decided
they
were
storehouses
there
the
messhall
his
friend
pointed
they
went
on
to
another
long
low
building
inside
which
hanlon
saw
a
long
hall
from
which
opened
dozens
of
doors
on
either
side
the
other
men
disappeared
into
one
or
another
of
the
rooms
and
the
young
fellow
stopped
at
another
door
grab
the
first
room
that
has
a
key
in
the
lock
outside
he
said
they
all
alike
the
ss
man
found
one
with
the
number
on
the
door
and
went
in
the
room
was
small
but
comfortably
furnished
the
bed
had
a
good
mattress
he
found
and
white
linen
sheets
and
a
thin
fleecy
blanket
folded
on
the
foot
there
was
a
big
easy
chair
a
closet
for
his
clothes
and
a
dresser
with
four
drawers
were
set
in
the
ceiling
and
there
was
another
on
a
standard
by
the
big
chair
for
easy
reading
a
door
opened
into
another
room
which
proved
to
be
a
compact
toilet
and
shower
everything
was
immaculately
clean
and
the
air
was
cooled
and
sweet
from
not
bad
not
bad
at
all
hanlon
said
as
he
unpacked
and
stored
his
things
then
he
took
a
shower
man
are
you
going
to
get
plenty
of
in
this
heat
he
apostrophised
the
shower
thankfully
dressing
again
he
went
out
to
locate
peter
philander
his
new
boss
he
stopped
at
the
messhall
and
there
he
found
the
cook
a
jolly
sort
of
man
he
introduced
himself
and
they
chatted
for
a
few
minutes
i
going
to
like
this
guy
hope
they
all
as
nice
and
friendly
hanlon
thought
where
the
super
office
he
asked
and
the
cook
pointed
it
out
entering
the
hanlon
found
himself
in
a
fairly
large
room
with
a
number
of
desks
and
several
drafting
boards
with
and
drawings
pinned
on
them
behind
one
of
the
larger
desks
was
a
man
with
a
great
angry
scar
across
his
left
cheek
and
neck
running
from
the
bridge
of
the
nose
to
below
the
ear
something
about
the
man
brought
a
sense
of
distrust
to
hanlon
perhaps
his
looks
for
that
terrible
scar
made
him
look
like
a
pirate
hanlon
discreetly
let
none
of
these
things
show
in
his
voice
or
demeanor
as
he
stepped
forward
a
smile
on
his
face
and
his
credentials
in
his
hand
philander
sir
i
george
hanlon
a
new
guard
the
other
nodded
without
a
word
and
snatched
at
the
papers
glaring
at
hanlon
in
a
squinting
suspicious
manner
hanlon
probed
toward
the
mind
behind
that
frown
and
could
sense
a
feeling
of
fear
suspicion
and
unrest
he
caught
a
fragment
of
thought
another
one
after
my
job
and
in
a
flash
of
inspiration
guessed
what
was
wrong
this
superintendent
must
have
a
terrible
inferiority
complex
which
that
disfiguring
scar
certainly
did
help
he
was
undoubtedly
competent
or
he
would
not
be
here
but
felt
every
new
man
was
a
possible
challenge
or
replacement
knowing
that
his
papers
made
no
mention
of
his
having
been
a
cadet
hanlon
took
a
chance
on
a
course
of
action
gee
philander
sir
i
envy
you
he
said
the
moment
the
man
looked
up
knowing
all
about
metals
and
ores
and
mining
and
stuff
like
that
i
sure
wish
i
had
the
chance
to
learn
something
valuable
like
that
but
me
i
guess
i
just
a
back
weak
mind
sort
of
guy
the
superintendent
looked
at
him
piercingly
for
a
long
moment
as
though
trying
to
decide
whether
this
was
genuine
or
subtle
sarcasm
he
must
have
decided
it
was
the
former
for
he
relaxed
a
bit
yeah
he
growled
in
a
deep
bass
that
seemed
meant
to
be
pleasant
now
it
takes
a
lot
of
study
and
a
good
mind
to
learn
what
i
know
very
few
men
can
make
the
grade
and
hanlon
who
was
by
necessity
swiftly
becoming
a
good
judge
of
character
knew
he
had
this
man
pegged
and
that
while
he
would
be
dangerous
if
crossed
could
be
handled
adroitly
just
what
will
my
duties
be
sir
or
have
you
delegated
the
handling
of
us
guards
to
some
lesser
man
no
i
handle
myself
you
want
a
job
well
done
do
it
yourself
you
know
i
take
you
out
and
show
you
around
are
you
all
settled
and
comfortable
oh
yes
sir
i
have
a
very
nice
room
number
and
am
all
unpacked
hunting
your
office
i
ran
into
the
messhall
and
cookie
told
me
about
meal
hours
i
sure
i
get
along
fine
here
as
much
as
this
awful
heat
let
me
they
sure
were
kidding
when
they
said
it
was
hot
here
and
i
want
to
assure
you
sir
that
i
work
hard
and
tend
strictly
to
business
nothing
else
the
superintendent
was
becoming
more
mollified
and
less
fearful
by
the
second
now
he
actually
smiled
a
rather
pitiful
travesty
of
a
smile
and
hanlon
sympathy
went
out
to
him
then
we
get
along
fine
philander
said
just
remember
that
your
job
is
only
to
keep
the
natives
at
work
during
your
shift
and
that
in
your
off
hours
you
do
not
go
hunting
into
things
that
none
of
your
business
oh
naturally
sir
you
just
list
what
limits
i
to
keep
in
and
stay
there
all
i
after
here
is
that
thousand
credits
a
month
and
as
big
a
bonus
as
i
can
earn
you
see
with
engaging
frankness
i
a
guy
that
wants
to
make
his
pile
as
quick
as
possible
so
i
wo
have
to
work
all
my
life
i
got
to
work
to
get
sure
but
i
do
aim
to
work
forever
hmmpfff
philander
rose
from
behind
the
desk
come
on
i
show
you
around
chapter
for
an
hour
superintendent
philander
escorted
george
hanlon
about
the
diggings
showing
him
the
various
buildings
and
the
workers
stockade
prison
would
be
a
better
word
hanlon
thought
enraged
that
there
were
still
men
who
would
enslave
others
for
their
own
personal
gain
the
young
earthman
got
a
real
shock
of
surprise
at
his
first
sight
of
the
native
they
were
so
entirely
different
from
anything
he
had
ever
suspected
might
exist
they
were
tall
and
slender
and
their
skin
was
rough
and
irregular
they
seemed
possessed
of
considerable
wiry
strength
however
hanlon
had
the
peculiar
feeling
that
they
were
somehow
familiar
as
though
related
to
something
he
already
knew
even
though
they
were
so
alien
but
strain
as
he
might
he
could
not
at
first
bring
that
elusive
thought
into
recognition
he
examined
more
particularly
each
item
of
the
natives
appearance
they
had
small
triangular
eyes
on
their
narrow
faces
almost
like
a
bird
yet
not
set
quite
as
far
back
they
could
see
forward
and
somewhat
to
either
side
he
guessed
with
a
much
wider
range
of
vision
than
humans
have
they
also
had
mouths
which
worked
somewhat
on
the
sphincter
method
even
though
their
faces
were
sort
of
there
was
somehow
a
strange
beauty
to
them
he
noticed
that
when
two
or
more
faced
each
other
they
often
worked
their
mouths
and
guessed
they
were
conversing
although
not
a
sound
could
be
heard
coming
from
them
other
than
a
peculiar
faint
rustling
as
they
moved
it
was
the
latter
that
gave
him
the
clue
trees
what
they
reminded
him
of
that
skin
of
theirs
was
like
new
bark
their
limbs
were
irregular
suggesting
the
branches
of
a
tree
rather
than
the
graceful
roundness
of
human
and
terran
animal
limbs
he
turned
excitedly
to
philander
hey
those
natives
are
partly
vegetable
are
they
like
trees
that
can
move
and
think
that
what
they
say
philander
said
shortly
though
i
do
know
about
the
part
no
one
ever
been
able
to
figure
out
they
do
talk
and
ca
seem
to
hear
us
no
matter
how
loud
we
yell
we
have
to
show
everything
we
want
to
do
and
give
orders
by
signs
whips
do
do
any
good
when
they
loaf
they
do
seem
to
feel
so
we
use
electric
like
you
see
that
guard
there
carrying
hanlon
was
silent
for
several
moments
but
his
mind
was
attempting
to
probe
into
that
of
the
native
nearest
him
nor
was
he
surprised
to
discover
that
this
native
had
a
really
respectable
mind
alert
and
keen
hanlon
could
read
quite
easily
pictures
of
various
things
but
he
could
not
interpret
them
yet
he
could
feel
their
sense
of
shame
and
degradation
at
such
an
enslaved
condition
and
the
dull
anger
they
felt
for
the
humans
who
had
made
them
so
this
promised
to
be
a
fertile
field
for
study
and
the
young
ss
man
felt
a
thrill
that
he
could
do
a
lot
of
prowling
and
studying
without
seeming
to
break
the
rules
philander
had
laid
down
for
his
conduct
this
certainly
is
my
field
he
thought
i
sure
glad
i
decided
to
take
the
chance
of
coming
here
the
corps
must
learn
of
this
situation
the
superintendent
broke
in
on
his
thoughts
i
got
to
go
back
to
the
office
before
dinner
go
to
the
commissary
store
there
and
get
your
chronom
exchanged
for
one
that
runs
on
algonian
time
yours
will
be
stored
for
safekeeping
and
changed
back
if
or
when
you
leave
here
as
he
walked
away
hanlon
thrilled
to
the
knowledge
that
he
had
gained
two
valuable
pieces
of
information
first
and
most
important
the
name
of
this
planet
algon
second
but
this
one
a
bit
dismaying
that
there
might
be
some
doubt
as
to
whether
or
not
he
would
ever
leave
here
was
there
some
danger
here
of
which
he
had
not
been
told
or
was
it
that
the
leader
promise
of
four
months
work
and
then
a
vacation
back
to
simonides
perhaps
meant
nothing
at
all
was
merely
a
come
on
it
was
more
than
the
perspiration
from
the
terrible
heat
that
dampened
hanlon
skin
as
he
walked
thoughtfully
over
to
the
store
yet
he
tingled
with
the
knowledge
that
at
least
he
knew
where
he
was
now
his
only
worry
was
getting
that
knowledge
to
the
corps
at
dinner
a
little
later
he
had
his
first
chance
to
meet
all
the
men
with
whom
he
would
be
working
the
superintendent
introduced
them
all
around
when
they
sat
down
at
the
long
table
there
were
eleven
other
guards
all
older
all
bigger
men
than
he
they
were
alike
in
that
all
appeared
to
be
swaggering
bullies
and
he
could
well
imagine
how
ready
they
were
with
the
use
of
those
or
other
forms
of
brutality
to
torture
the
algonians
at
the
least
provocation
or
no
provocation
whatever
without
exception
these
guards
had
heavy
faces
most
of
them
unshaven
and
most
with
thick
shaggy
eyebrows
even
in
that
room
their
generally
unwashed
condition
was
noticeable
hanlon
knew
instinctively
he
would
make
no
friends
among
them
i
only
hope
i
make
no
enemies
why
was
i
so
drastically
different
from
them
chosen
as
a
guard
what
that
leader
got
in
his
devious
mind
anyway
there
were
four
mining
engineers
and
these
men
were
keen
alert
fellows
one
seemed
about
another
in
his
late
thirties
and
the
two
others
young
men
evidently
not
long
out
of
school
they
were
and
friendly
where
the
guards
were
surly
and
sneering
at
hanlon
youth
and
slimness
there
was
an
accountant
the
store
clerk
two
checkers
who
tallied
ore
brought
up
each
shift
a
half
dozen
others
who
apparently
were
truckmen
and
hoistmen
completed
with
philander
the
cook
and
the
bunkhouse
cleaner
the
human
crew
at
this
mine
hanlon
had
been
seated
between
one
of
the
guards
a
huge
man
by
the
name
of
groton
and
one
of
the
young
engineers
the
latter
made
him
welcome
and
asked
where
he
came
from
i
just
moved
to
simonides
when
i
got
the
chance
to
come
here
hanlon
explained
i
was
born
and
raised
on
terra
terra
the
young
man
voice
was
interested
and
several
others
about
the
table
raised
their
heads
at
that
name
i
always
wanted
to
see
the
mother
world
when
all
had
finished
eating
several
of
the
other
men
who
had
never
seen
terra
moved
closer
to
hanlon
asking
many
questions
i
understand
terra
has
the
best
technicians
in
the
universe
one
of
the
hoistmen
said
that
used
to
be
the
case
hanlon
answered
honestly
but
now
i
understand
simonides
has
just
as
she
is
the
wealthiest
planet
of
course
terra
being
the
original
world
was
bound
to
have
the
best
the
race
could
breed
in
all
lines
of
endeavor
but
when
so
many
people
migrated
to
other
planets
she
gradually
lost
many
of
her
finest
brains
later
those
other
planets
offered
such
fabulous
wages
to
men
and
women
with
skills
and
trainings
her
first
inhabitants
lacked
that
terra
was
further
drained
that
the
pity
of
colonization
the
elder
engineer
sighed
it
builds
new
lands
at
the
expense
of
the
old
taking
all
their
strongest
most
adventurous
and
most
imaginative
soon
the
original
country
or
continent
or
planet
is
peopled
only
by
the
dregs
i
do
like
to
think
terra
has
only
dregs
left
after
all
i
came
from
there
you
know
hanlon
grinned
and
they
smiled
back
companionably
but
i
know
you
right
in
part
at
least
that
will
probably
be
the
case
in
time
just
as
it
will
with
the
other
planets
as
their
best
and
younger
go
out
to
open
up
still
more
worlds
in
the
middle
of
that
first
night
on
algon
something
perhaps
his
brought
george
hanlon
wide
awake
his
every
mental
faculty
clear
and
alert
click
click
click
like
pieces
of
a
puzzle
falling
into
place
many
of
the
odds
and
ends
of
apparently
unrelated
information
and
experience
fell
into
place
in
this
enigma
he
remembered
clearly
now
an
incident
that
had
merely
brought
a
momentary
wonder
at
the
time
those
last
minutes
before
the
ship
took
off
the
leader
had
stared
long
and
piercingly
into
his
eyes
and
hanlon
wondering
and
puzzled
as
to
what
the
man
was
seeking
merely
stared
back
dumbly
now
he
remembered
the
flashing
thought
quickly
dismissed
as
ridiculous
that
even
if
he
did
find
out
where
he
was
going
he
must
never
tell
anyone
must
forget
it
entirely
and
instantly
on
pain
of
severe
torture
why
that
leader
must
have
been
trying
to
implant
a
hypnotic
compulsion
in
his
mind
and
must
have
thought
he
succeeded
else
hanlon
would
never
have
reached
here
alive
that
was
why
he
could
never
read
that
knowledge
from
the
mind
of
any
of
the
people
he
had
contacted
who
were
in
on
this
game
not
even
that
ship
officer
who
certainly
should
have
known
but
wait
a
minute
what
about
philander
he
knew
had
the
hypnosis
worked
on
him
or
was
that
name
algon
merely
one
the
super
used
in
place
of
the
real
one
he
did
know
he
knew
or
again
could
it
be
that
he
was
so
well
trusted
that
the
knowledge
had
not
been
sealed
off
from
him
of
the
three
hanlon
argued
the
latter
was
probably
the
truth
another
point
that
vague
reference
to
if
or
when
you
leave
here
was
undoubtedly
a
slip
of
the
tongue
philander
had
probably
guessed
or
perhaps
it
was
so
with
all
men
that
hanlon
was
here
on
probation
if
so
the
thought
was
insistent
i
sure
will
have
to
watch
my
step
every
minute
and
not
let
slip
what
i
trying
to
do
here
but
further
moments
of
thought
brought
the
reasonable
conclusion
that
he
could
lull
their
suspicion
by
buckling
down
and
making
a
real
record
for
efficiency
or
and
this
gave
him
the
cold
shivers
for
a
moment
so
that
he
instinctively
burrowed
a
bit
further
down
beneath
the
sheet
as
though
it
could
protect
and
warm
him
did
they
know
all
about
him
already
and
had
sent
him
here
to
get
rid
of
him
was
he
to
become
another
victim
of
one
of
the
leader
little
accidents
yes
if
they
still
disbelieved
his
story
about
his
dismissal
they
might
well
be
determined
to
get
rid
of
him
in
a
way
that
would
not
incriminate
them
they
would
know
that
if
hanlon
was
still
a
corpsman
his
death
would
be
most
thoroughly
investigated
perhaps
but
if
that
was
the
case
why
let
him
get
here
at
all
his
accident
fatal
of
course
so
sorry
could
just
as
well
have
occurred
on
the
way
no
more
likely
he
was
still
on
probation
they
were
not
quite
sure
of
him
but
were
giving
him
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
the
leader
seemed
to
like
him
in
a
curious
way
well
he
was
now
warned
and
would
watch
himself
more
carefully
than
ever
and
he
had
learned
a
lot
and
would
learn
more
he
smiled
contentedly
and
went
back
to
sleep
the
next
day
he
had
his
first
taste
of
guarding
the
natives
as
they
worked
the
superintendent
himself
inducted
him
into
the
task
shortly
before
shift
time
philander
appeared
at
hanlon
room
just
as
the
young
man
was
putting
on
the
special
clothing
he
had
been
told
to
wear
on
duty
in
the
mine
ready
philander
was
strangely
courteous
and
let
go
collect
your
crew
they
went
over
to
the
stockade
the
superintendent
giving
hanlon
a
key
as
they
unlocked
the
gates
hanlon
saw
that
the
corral
was
divided
into
twelve
sections
one
guard
has
charge
of
all
the
natives
in
one
section
and
they
all
work
each
shift
philander
explained
what
if
one
of
them
is
sick
they
do
get
sick
the
man
voice
was
gruff
and
hanlon
first
thought
was
that
what
he
really
meant
was
that
the
natives
were
worked
no
matter
how
they
felt
but
he
quickly
became
ashamed
of
the
thought
he
did
know
anything
about
them
yet
and
perhaps
they
actually
never
did
get
sick
he
would
have
to
quit
jumping
to
conclusions
that
way
it
would
seriously
retard
his
ability
to
make
correct
deductions
at
the
rearmost
section
philander
opened
another
gate
with
the
same
key
and
flashed
his
portable
inside
the
large
hut
that
covered
most
of
the
space
of
the
section
hanlon
close
behind
could
see
about
twenty
of
the
greenies
as
he
had
learned
they
were
usually
called
standing
or
lying
about
there
was
no
furniture
inside
no
chairs
nor
stools
tables
or
beds
they
eat
and
sleep
standing
up
that
why
the
huts
do
need
any
furnishings
philander
explained
at
sight
of
the
men
and
the
light
most
of
the
natives
began
moving
toward
the
door
a
few
at
the
back
did
move
fast
enough
to
satisfy
philander
and
with
a
curse
he
ran
back
and
touched
them
with
that
he
carried
hanlon
could
see
an
expression
of
agony
on
the
faces
of
those
touched
and
as
they
writhed
away
from
the
rod
he
realized
it
must
be
very
painful
indeed
if
not
exquisite
torture
to
them
they
now
jumped
forward
and
huddled
pathetically
near
the
door
philander
took
a
long
light
but
very
tough
line
from
his
pocket
it
had
a
series
of
running
nooses
in
it
and
he
slipped
one
of
these
about
the
wrist
of
each
native
drawing
it
tight
then
he
them
out
of
the
stockade
to
the
mine
entrance
and
down
the
drift
to
the
rise
they
had
to
climb
to
get
to
the
stope
hanlon
crew
was
to
work
once
there
and
released
from
the
rope
the
natives
seemed
to
know
what
they
were
supposed
to
do
and
sullenly
started
doing
it
you
usually
use
three
pickmen
four
shovellers
four
for
your
timbering
crew
three
sorters
and
six
on
the
philander
explained
sometimes
if
the
vein
widens
out
enough
you
get
extra
hands
to
work
the
wider
face
but
this
size
crew
generally
works
out
best
you
soon
get
used
to
it
so
you
know
how
many
you
need
if
more
just
yell
and
you
get
if
it
happens
the
vein
narrows
so
you
ca
use
all
these
to
best
advantage
someone
working
a
wider
vein
can
use
your
extras
temporarily
i
get
it
hanlon
was
very
attentive
he
was
determined
to
learn
this
work
quickly
and
thoroughly
and
to
make
a
good
record
philander
showed
hanlon
the
difference
between
the
ore
and
the
surrounding
rock
and
explained
very
carefully
how
he
was
to
watch
especially
for
any
side
veins
branching
off
from
the
main
one
make
sure
the
greenies
clean
out
all
the
ore
as
they
go
along
before
timbered
up
i
understand
everything
so
far
keep
the
lazy
beggars
going
full
speed
philander
was
very
emphatic
do
let
lag
or
they
wear
you
down
do
ever
let
get
out
of
control
or
put
anything
over
on
you
especially
in
sorting
ore
from
rock
they
tricky
use
your
at
every
least
sign
of
mutiny
or
loafing
make
respect
you
they
know
to
try
to
get
away
they
hate
the
rod
what
does
it
do
to
them
we
do
know
exactly
except
they
can
feel
it
and
will
do
anything
to
get
away
from
it
maybe
it
hurts
them
terribly
look
punk
philander
lost
his
friendliness
and
snarled
at
hanlon
with
twisted
face
we
do
care
whether
they
like
it
or
not
they
know
their
jobs
and
they
do
have
to
get
shocked
if
they
keep
working
so
it
strictly
up
to
them
do
go
getting
any
soft
notions
about
these
lousy
greenies
they
only
dumb
brutes
fit
for
working
so
work
i
work
hanlon
said
chapter
yes
hanlon
would
work
the
natives
but
without
cruelty
his
thoughts
were
a
seething
of
contempt
for
these
brutal
thugs
he
was
willing
to
bet
right
there
and
then
without
knowing
anything
about
this
situation
that
these
natives
could
be
controlled
without
bullying
or
hurting
them
and
better
having
had
military
training
hanlon
knew
it
was
possible
to
enforce
the
most
strict
discipline
without
such
means
and
that
any
man
or
entity
probably
could
and
would
submit
to
discipline
fairly
and
decently
enforced
with
far
less
trouble
and
animosity
and
with
far
greater
productivity
than
if
he
were
driven
to
it
anybody
works
better
for
a
pat
on
the
back
than
for
a
kick
in
the
pants
he
thought
indignantly
philander
stood
about
for
an
hour
and
when
he
saw
that
hanlon
understood
exactly
what
was
expected
of
him
and
his
crew
when
he
saw
hanlon
several
times
correct
the
sorters
who
had
left
too
much
rock
in
with
the
ores
he
turned
to
leave
you
hear
the
siren
when
the
shift
over
he
said
bring
your
gang
back
and
lock
in
the
stockade
then
be
sure
you
lock
both
gates
carefully
cookie
gave
me
a
lunch
for
hanlon
said
what
about
the
natives
do
they
eat
then
too
naw
they
do
eat
was
the
surprising
answer
once
a
day
they
stick
their
hands
into
the
dirt
for
nearly
an
hour
must
get
nourishment
that
way
that
seems
to
prove
they
vegetable
matter
their
fingers
must
be
some
sort
of
feeding
roots
hanlon
observed
sagely
they
sure
are
the
strangest
beings
i
ever
heard
of
the
superintendent
shrugged
and
left
without
further
words
hanlon
looked
about
and
found
a
rock
near
the
sorters
and
used
this
for
a
seat
he
sat
watching
the
natives
work
and
speculating
about
them
and
also
about
what
this
was
all
about
the
mine
seemed
to
him
a
very
rich
one
and
by
using
slave
labor
those
men
could
well
be
reaping
a
huge
fortune
from
it
no
wonder
they
could
afford
to
pay
guards
a
thousand
a
month
after
a
bit
one
of
the
natives
seeing
hanlon
merely
sitting
there
instead
of
being
alertly
on
guard
close
to
them
dropped
its
shovel
and
turned
away
from
its
work
hanlon
got
up
leisurely
but
walked
purposefully
over
to
confront
the
greenie
he
smiled
and
motioned
the
native
back
to
work
the
greenie
face
showed
surprise
at
hanlon
action
but
it
made
no
move
to
go
it
did
however
appear
to
be
keeping
its
eyes
alertly
on
that
dread
hanging
loosely
in
hanlon
hand
the
guard
could
see
that
the
others
had
also
stopped
work
and
were
carefully
watching
the
little
drama
hanlon
smiled
and
again
motioned
the
native
back
to
work
and
when
it
did
not
move
he
reached
out
grasped
it
gently
by
the
shoulder
and
still
gently
pushed
it
in
the
direction
of
its
shovel
with
what
was
really
a
pat
on
the
back
there
were
looks
of
surprise
that
amounted
almost
to
stupefaction
on
the
faces
of
all
the
natives
the
one
who
had
first
stopped
now
picked
up
its
shovel
and
resumed
work
and
the
rest
followed
its
example
hanlon
resumed
his
seat
still
with
that
friendly
smile
on
his
face
he
noticed
with
satisfaction
that
they
were
soon
working
harder
and
faster
than
before
the
incident
i
was
right
he
told
himself
almost
smugly
the
six
hour
shift
was
finally
ended
without
any
further
show
of
resistance
that
is
it
was
six
hours
by
algonian
time
but
about
eight
by
terra
standards
for
on
algon
while
the
day
had
been
divided
by
the
humans
into
hours
the
same
as
on
earth
each
hour
was
almost
minutes
long
they
divided
the
year
into
five
day
weeks
though
so
it
averaged
out
about
the
same
when
the
siren
blew
hanlon
smiled
happily
at
his
crew
as
he
herded
them
together
and
made
applauding
motions
with
his
hands
wondering
if
they
understood
what
he
meant
when
he
had
locked
the
natives
in
their
stockade
he
hunted
up
the
checkers
how
i
do
he
asked
come
anywhere
near
what
i
was
supposed
to
get
out
one
of
the
checkers
totalled
up
his
figures
then
looked
up
in
surprise
hey
kid
you
did
all
right
nearly
a
hundred
pounds
over
the
usual
output
and
clean
too
that
really
okay
for
a
new
guard
and
then
some
did
have
any
trouble
eh
trouble
hanlon
asked
naively
was
i
supposed
to
have
some
then
he
could
help
grinning
thanks
for
the
info
and
went
to
his
room
took
a
shower
to
cool
off
after
that
muggy
heat
in
the
mine
then
tumbled
onto
his
bunk
for
a
nap
until
those
first
days
so
thoroughly
disgusted
george
hanlon
as
he
saw
the
continued
and
senseless
brutality
the
guards
used
toward
their
native
slaves
that
he
had
trouble
concealing
his
feelings
he
continued
to
treat
his
greenies
with
the
respect
he
felt
was
due
them
and
he
could
not
help
but
notice
they
seemed
to
look
on
him
more
and
more
as
their
friend
they
always
smiled
when
he
looked
at
them
and
before
many
days
he
discovered
that
his
crew
was
doing
more
work
than
any
of
the
others
his
had
convinced
him
they
were
high
enough
in
the
scale
of
evolution
to
know
the
meaning
of
gratitude
and
he
could
tell
they
were
repaying
his
kindness
with
he
had
begun
to
make
much
more
sense
out
of
the
pictures
he
saw
in
their
minds
and
to
get
some
glimmerings
of
understanding
about
their
alien
concepts
also
it
was
increasingly
borne
in
upon
him
that
they
did
talk
to
each
other
and
he
guessed
shrewdly
that
the
reason
no
one
could
hear
them
was
because
their
voices
were
above
or
below
the
range
of
human
hearing
above
he
finally
deduced
that
gave
him
the
idea
for
an
experiment
and
he
started
whistling
as
loud
as
he
could
gradually
raising
his
tones
until
he
was
at
the
top
of
his
range
he
saw
with
interest
and
excitement
that
the
last
one
or
two
shrillest
notes
seemed
to
attract
their
attention
their
little
triangular
ears
perked
up
and
began
twitching
they
turned
about
as
though
seeking
the
source
of
that
sound
while
every
mouth
began
working
with
signs
of
utmost
excitement
and
his
mind
caught
concepts
of
surprise
and
wonder
that
convinced
him
and
so
in
his
next
several
he
surreptitiously
collected
various
articles
and
pieces
of
material
and
in
his
room
started
the
construction
of
a
little
machine
his
course
in
the
corps
school
had
included
considerable
mechanics
and
electronics
and
the
tearing
down
and
rebuilding
of
many
of
the
machines
and
instruments
the
corps
used
what
he
was
trying
to
make
now
was
a
if
it
would
do
what
he
was
sure
it
would
and
if
he
was
right
about
the
algonians
having
vocal
ability
they
should
be
able
to
hear
each
other
and
some
day
he
might
learn
their
language
well
enough
to
converse
with
them
he
finished
it
and
smuggled
the
little
machine
into
his
place
in
the
mine
when
he
had
his
crew
down
there
and
working
at
their
tasks
he
got
out
the
little
box
he
turned
on
the
current
from
the
small
battery
installed
in
it
then
began
talking
at
the
same
time
he
was
turning
a
rheostat
higher
and
higher
finally
he
noticed
those
mobile
ears
began
to
twitch
and
as
he
turned
the
tones
higher
and
still
higher
more
and
more
of
the
natives
stopped
work
and
turned
toward
him
finally
he
noticed
an
intenser
excitement
among
them
and
they
dropped
their
tools
and
came
crowding
closer
to
him
and
his
machine
their
little
eyes
almost
emitting
sparks
of
excitement
he
thrilled
with
the
realization
that
it
worked
now
he
turned
another
knob
more
and
more
and
gradually
from
the
speaker
came
a
jumble
of
sounds
much
like
but
very
low
he
kept
on
turning
the
rheostat
until
the
incoming
voices
seemed
about
the
same
pitch
as
his
own
voice
the
excitement
of
the
natives
had
grown
to
tremendous
proportions
and
his
own
equalled
theirs
their
little
mouths
were
working
faster
and
an
expression
almost
like
laughter
came
onto
their
peculiar
little
faces
as
they
heard
his
voice
and
knew
he
could
now
hear
theirs
hanlon
own
smile
almost
cracked
his
face
he
realized
he
had
learned
something
none
of
the
greedy
simonideans
knew
and
felt
that
here
was
the
possible
beginning
for
his
campaign
to
free
these
poor
native
slaves
he
beckoned
to
one
of
the
nearer
natives
to
come
to
his
side
then
waved
the
rest
back
to
their
work
they
looked
at
him
questioningly
for
a
moment
but
he
smiled
reassuringly
at
them
and
they
having
learned
that
he
never
used
that
dread
on
them
all
went
back
to
their
labors
leaving
the
one
native
standing
there
hanlon
looked
earnestly
at
the
greenie
pointed
a
finger
directly
at
himself
and
spoke
into
the
microphone
of
his
transformer
hanlon
he
said
slowly
and
distinctly
and
repeated
it
a
number
of
times
tapping
himself
on
the
chest
each
time
he
said
it
a
smile
of
comprehension
broke
over
the
native
little
face
and
he
tapped
himself
the
same
way
and
said
a
word
that
came
out
of
the
speaker
sounding
like
geck
hanlon
reached
out
and
touched
the
native
and
said
geck
the
greenie
in
turn
tapped
hanlon
and
said
and
they
had
made
the
first
beginnings
of
understanding
each
other
from
then
on
this
one
native
was
released
from
all
other
work
while
hanlon
crew
was
on
duty
and
the
two
devoted
all
their
efforts
to
learning
how
to
talk
to
each
other
hanlon
was
pleased
but
not
especially
surprised
to
note
that
the
rest
of
the
crew
now
almost
entirely
without
his
supervision
worked
harder
than
ever
and
that
their
daily
output
of
ore
grew
progressively
greater
each
shift
and
all
clean
hanlon
first
exultant
thought
had
been
to
run
to
philander
and
tell
him
of
what
he
had
learned
concerning
the
native
speech
ability
and
how
he
had
made
it
possible
for
humans
to
talk
to
them
but
more
sober
reflections
during
that
long
brought
caution
he
decided
this
was
a
bit
of
knowledge
he
had
better
keep
to
himself
as
long
as
possible
he
hoped
he
could
keep
it
until
he
had
learned
how
to
talk
with
these
people
and
learned
much
about
them
their
situation
and
how
it
could
best
be
ameliorated
the
other
men
he
knew
considered
the
natives
simply
beasts
and
would
probably
take
away
his
transformer
instead
of
using
it
to
learn
about
the
greenies
as
he
planned
to
do
by
the
end
of
a
month
he
and
geck
were
chatting
away
like
brothers
each
had
learned
enough
of
the
other
language
so
that
by
using
a
mixture
of
the
two
they
could
exchange
almost
any
thought
concept
desired
ability
to
read
the
native
surface
thoughts
helped
a
lot
especially
as
he
began
to
understand
their
alien
ways
of
thinking
even
so
he
was
surprised
at
how
quickly
geck
was
picking
up
his
own
language
hanlon
found
that
these
people
while
they
had
no
scientific
or
mechanical
knowledge
or
training
of
their
own
did
have
highly
developed
ethical
principles
which
governed
all
their
individual
and
collective
actions
they
were
a
simple
natural
people
with
a
native
dignity
hanlon
almost
envied
he
found
too
that
his
first
shrewd
guess
was
correct
their
bodies
were
of
vegetable
matter
rather
than
they
reproduced
by
budding
and
he
saw
a
number
of
the
females
to
whom
were
attached
buds
of
varying
sizes
one
day
he
watched
interestedly
while
one
of
the
ripened
buds
a
individual
but
only
about
ten
inches
high
detached
itself
from
its
parent
and
dropped
to
the
ground
it
lay
there
for
some
minutes
while
the
mother
watched
it
carefully
then
it
rose
by
itself
and
trotted
away
with
her
as
she
resumed
her
work
a
miniature
but
fully
alive
native
child
it
would
take
about
two
years
for
it
to
attain
its
maturity
geck
informed
him
hanlon
asked
and
geck
said
it
could
take
care
of
itself
alone
in
the
forest
so
hanlon
managed
to
sneak
it
out
into
the
woods
where
it
would
be
free
geck
told
him
that
about
four
years
previous
a
great
egg
had
landed
here
on
guddu
which
was
their
name
for
the
planet
men
had
come
from
inside
it
and
scattered
all
about
seeking
the
metal
ores
they
were
now
mining
the
natives
friendly
and
childishly
curious
had
gathered
in
force
to
watch
these
strange
new
creatures
and
because
of
their
trusting
natures
had
been
easily
trapped
imprisoned
and
forced
to
work
long
hard
hours
in
the
holes
us
die
swiftly
away
from
sunlight
geck
said
sadly
us
have
very
long
but
underground
work
make
us
fast
idea
often
discussed
among
we
to
discontinue
race
because
soon
all
we
be
gone
anyway
that
quiet
hopeless
statement
made
hanlon
madder
than
a
wet
cat
what
do
the
do
to
you
he
asked
after
a
while
affect
we
nervous
system
some
way
us
get
most
terrible
cramps
is
horrible
agony
us
so
thankful
you
never
use
i
knew
you
would
work
without
them
as
long
as
you
were
treated
fairly
to
himself
hanlon
swore
a
determined
oath
to
finish
this
business
entirely
some
way
or
another
he
realized
his
limitations
one
young
inexperienced
man
against
twenty
ruthless
greedy
ruffians
and
that
only
here
at
this
one
mine
no
telling
how
many
others
there
were
on
algon
besides
all
those
back
on
simonides
and
who
knew
what
other
planets
who
were
in
on
this
plot
his
heart
clamored
for
swift
action
his
brain
counselled
caution
and
careful
planning
chapter
hanlon
was
sitting
at
his
usual
place
in
the
mine
one
day
when
one
of
the
ran
up
and
spoke
swiftly
to
geck
who
turned
to
hanlon
alarm
on
his
face
big
boss
man
come
hanlon
jumped
to
his
feet
get
everyone
to
work
tell
them
to
act
real
busy
he
snapped
you
too
he
thrust
the
into
a
hole
prepared
for
just
such
an
emergency
grabbed
up
his
and
stepped
closer
to
the
natives
he
was
standing
there
to
all
appearances
strictly
on
the
job
of
making
his
charges
work
when
philander
came
crawling
up
the
rise
into
the
pocket
where
this
crew
was
mining
the
glossy
lustrous
uraninite
how
things
going
the
superintendent
greeted
hanlon
with
at
least
the
appearance
of
friendliness
just
fine
the
young
man
responded
everything
under
control
been
looking
over
the
reports
and
see
your
crew
is
getting
out
more
any
of
the
others
the
super
voice
held
just
a
tinge
of
anxiety
and
hanlon
began
probing
that
mind
to
see
if
he
could
discover
just
what
all
this
portended
i
just
keep
at
it
he
shrugged
no
trouble
nope
no
trouble
look
at
he
waved
his
hand
at
the
busy
crew
the
big
man
regarded
them
closely
and
could
see
that
every
single
one
of
the
natives
was
working
at
what
he
knew
was
their
top
speed
and
without
a
single
slacker
even
the
were
moving
almost
at
a
rather
than
the
lazy
saunter
most
natives
used
in
an
effort
to
do
no
more
than
they
were
forced
to
do
philander
shook
his
head
wonderingly
how
do
it
he
asked
the
other
guards
have
to
keep
shocking
one
after
another
of
the
lazy
dogs
yet
you
made
no
move
at
a
single
one
and
they
keep
right
on
hustling
i
never
seen
a
crew
work
so
hard
hanlon
wanted
desperately
to
tell
him
but
he
decided
the
time
was
not
yet
so
he
merely
shrugged
the
question
away
as
of
little
consequence
i
dunno
sir
i
just
stand
around
watching
and
they
work
he
grinned
into
the
super
face
must
be
my
manly
charms
er
sumpin
he
chuckled
then
sobered
maybe
one
reason
is
that
i
rotate
any
job
gets
monotonous
so
every
hour
or
so
i
let
change
around
from
pick
to
barrow
to
sorting
and
so
on
a
frown
of
annoyance
came
onto
philander
face
but
he
quickly
erased
it
after
all
this
man
was
getting
out
more
ore
than
the
others
and
that
was
what
he
was
here
for
how
he
did
it
did
matter
so
much
after
all
as
long
as
he
kept
up
his
record
but
hanlon
reading
those
surface
thoughts
knew
that
the
official
was
still
very
suspicious
and
vastly
worried
hanlon
knew
he
had
to
disarm
the
super
some
way
to
get
him
out
of
that
mood
he
decided
his
air
of
naivete
could
still
do
the
trick
philander
sir
his
voice
was
very
ingenuous
i
do
want
to
pry
into
anything
that
none
of
my
business
but
would
you
mind
telling
me
what
this
stuff
is
we
getting
here
it
is
anything
dangerous
is
it
i
mean
it
is
one
of
those
those
radium
ores
that
make
a
fellow
sterile
is
it
i
may
want
to
get
married
some
day
so
i
want
to
take
any
chances
the
mining
engineer
looked
at
him
blankly
for
a
moment
then
threw
back
his
head
and
laughter
rolled
out
until
it
seemed
to
fill
the
stope
hanlon
watched
the
other
mind
clear
itself
of
all
suspicion
at
least
for
the
time
being
philander
rested
his
hand
companionably
on
the
younger
man
shoulder
no
it
nothing
like
that
so
you
can
quit
worrying
and
the
bonus
you
get
if
you
can
keep
up
this
output
will
fix
you
so
you
can
afford
a
wife
when
your
time
up
and
you
go
back
to
sime
gee
that
good
hanlon
made
his
voice
and
face
show
how
relieved
he
felt
it
had
me
worried
even
though
i
have
got
a
girl
yet
the
superintendent
seemed
in
good
humor
now
hanlon
caught
the
thought
that
this
punk
was
a
good
guard
and
bright
and
he
did
get
the
stuff
out
the
plan
of
rotating
the
workers
was
good
he
order
the
other
guards
to
use
it
this
hanlon
probably
was
no
menace
to
their
plans
here
after
all
in
fact
maybe
later
they
could
use
him
on
the
bigger
job
he
philander
would
so
recommend
to
his
highness
when
he
made
his
next
report
after
a
few
more
casual
words
the
super
left
and
hanlon
sank
back
onto
his
favorite
lounging
place
thinking
very
seriously
and
contemplatively
about
this
whole
matter
again
he
had
run
into
that
thought
about
someone
called
his
highness
but
never
any
indication
as
to
who
the
man
was
or
what
position
he
occupied
it
was
now
apparent
that
this
individual
was
the
man
he
would
have
to
ferret
out
whose
plans
he
would
have
to
learn
before
the
corps
could
take
any
really
effective
action
he
certainly
hoped
that
one
was
the
top
man
it
was
going
to
be
hard
enough
to
get
a
line
on
him
to
say
nothing
of
anyone
even
higher
one
evening
at
dinner
some
time
later
hanlon
became
aware
that
the
guard
gorton
was
growling
at
him
he
looked
up
in
surprise
and
forced
himself
to
pay
attention
to
the
big
man
words
i
ask
ya
whatcha
tryin
t
do
punk
the
small
glared
redly
at
him
and
the
voice
was
harsh
and
bitter
show
up
us
other
guards
big
idea
gettin
out
more
we
do
hanlon
stared
back
in
amazement
and
his
voice
when
he
answered
was
a
stammer
of
surprise
why
why
i
not
trying
to
do
anything
except
my
job
he
added
more
forcefully
we
been
gettin
out
a
three
tons
a
shift
the
ugly
face
was
shoved
closer
to
his
and
hanlon
shrank
back
from
the
stench
of
raw
spirits
breathed
on
him
idea
drivin
yer
crew
up
t
three
a
half
er
four
i
was
told
to
keep
my
crew
working
and
i
been
doing
that
and
only
that
hanlon
snapped
and
take
your
ugly
stinking
face
away
from
mine
the
disgust
he
felt
at
the
brutality
of
these
guards
had
made
him
so
with
them
he
was
going
to
take
any
guff
from
one
of
them
even
though
gorton
him
by
a
good
sixty
pounds
and
probably
had
at
least
four
inches
longer
reach
hanlon
was
afraid
of
him
right
now
he
was
as
much
in
the
mood
for
a
fight
as
the
guard
seemed
to
be
for
at
hanlon
words
gorton
huge
hand
suddenly
slapped
out
at
the
younger
man
hanlon
was
able
entirely
to
dodge
safely
sitting
as
close
as
they
were
his
head
rang
from
the
terrific
blow
he
grabbed
his
cup
of
steaming
coffee
and
threw
it
backhand
into
face
bellowing
in
pain
and
anger
the
guard
jumped
up
upsetting
the
bench
and
almost
hanlon
with
it
but
the
younger
man
was
agile
and
kept
his
feet
as
gorton
rushed
his
long
heavy
arms
flailing
hanlon
ducked
away
and
jumped
back
far
enough
to
get
a
firm
footing
on
a
cleared
space
of
floor
all
corps
cadets
were
in
both
marquis
of
queensbury
boxing
judo
and
barroom
brawling
he
knew
all
the
questions
and
all
the
answers
so
hanlon
stepped
back
in
quickly
while
gorton
was
out
of
position
from
that
abortive
mighty
swing
he
drove
his
fist
to
the
wrist
into
the
big
man
soft
belly
as
gorton
doubled
up
with
an
explosive
grunt
hanlon
swung
from
the
heels
his
uppercut
caught
the
big
fellow
flush
on
the
jaw
and
staggered
him
but
gorton
could
take
it
and
charged
again
roaring
curses
by
sheer
weight
he
bore
hanlon
back
across
the
floor
and
got
in
a
couple
of
heavy
blows
hanlon
right
cheek
was
badly
bruised
and
that
eye
almost
closed
but
he
was
fighting
methodically
almost
viciously
he
was
in
and
out
slashing
and
ripping
gorton
face
to
shreds
the
other
guards
had
been
yelling
their
delight
at
the
fight
and
their
hatred
of
the
brash
newcomer
who
was
destroying
their
easy
it
was
plain
they
were
all
on
gorton
side
and
hoped
to
see
hanlon
get
thoroughly
whipped
bat
his
ears
off
gort
pound
some
sense
inta
him
show
him
who
top
man
aroun
here
one
of
them
was
not
content
with
yelling
as
hanlon
stepped
to
one
side
to
avoid
another
of
gorton
rushes
this
guard
stuck
out
his
leg
and
tripped
hanlon
who
fell
backward
instantly
gorton
was
on
him
and
a
great
foot
shot
out
in
a
kick
that
would
have
broken
every
rib
but
the
ss
man
was
watching
for
just
such
tricks
his
feet
snaked
out
and
hoisted
gorton
so
high
and
so
far
that
when
he
landed
he
crashed
like
a
great
falling
tree
hanlon
jumped
to
his
feet
and
swung
to
confront
his
foe
but
gorton
head
was
bleeding
badly
his
eyes
were
closed
his
face
contorted
he
was
out
like
a
burnt
match
instantly
hanlon
sank
to
his
knees
by
the
fallen
man
gently
raising
the
head
and
yelling
for
cold
water
and
a
towel
when
the
cook
came
running
with
them
hanlon
worked
as
swiftly
to
revive
the
guard
as
he
would
have
done
for
his
friend
the
other
guards
were
so
surprised
at
this
act
of
mercy
they
sat
like
dull
clods
but
a
couple
of
the
engineers
rose
and
came
swiftly
to
help
hanlon
one
of
the
checkers
ran
to
philander
office
for
the
first
aid
kit
the
men
were
working
desperately
to
stanch
the
flow
of
blood
when
superintendent
philander
came
running
in
with
the
clerk
and
the
kit
taking
in
the
situation
at
a
glance
he
demanded
an
explanation
th
punk
jumped
gort
an
tried
t
kill
one
of
the
guards
yelled
but
was
shouted
down
by
the
engineers
the
checkers
and
the
cook
before
the
other
guards
came
to
their
senses
enough
to
corroborate
their
fellow
mendacious
claim
the
senior
engineer
explained
fully
and
concisely
what
had
actually
happened
yet
after
all
that
the
kid
was
the
first
to
help
him
even
though
gorton
started
the
fight
for
no
reason
just
then
the
fallen
guard
groaned
and
began
to
regain
his
senses
the
men
helped
him
to
his
feet
he
blinked
for
some
moments
as
though
trying
to
figure
out
what
had
happened
to
him
then
remembrance
came
why
that
little
squirt
hittin
me
wit
a
chair
he
yelled
and
straggled
to
get
at
hanlon
again
nor
did
the
men
have
an
easy
time
holding
him
back
philander
planted
himself
squarely
in
front
of
the
angry
man
shut
up
he
blazed
and
the
tone
of
command
halted
the
big
fellow
he
stared
stupidly
at
his
boss
as
though
disbelieving
his
ears
you
keep
your
hands
off
hanlon
the
super
emphasized
his
words
by
tapping
gorton
not
gently
on
the
chest
i
hear
of
any
more
of
this
and
it
the
jug
the
next
ship
comes
then
back
to
sime
he
whirled
to
face
the
table
that
goes
for
all
the
rest
of
you
rats
too
if
hanlon
does
his
job
you
it
he
a
better
man
try
to
match
him
do
go
gunning
for
him
he
your
pet
pete
one
asked
mockingly
no
he
not
my
pet
pete
the
super
voice
mimicked
the
tone
although
his
face
went
red
at
the
accusation
i
just
do
want
this
camp
messed
up
with
any
feuds
that
cut
down
production
and
the
big
boy
wants
this
ore
out
fast
if
hanlon
can
work
his
crew
the
rest
of
you
you
a
blasted
sight
better
find
out
how
he
does
it
not
try
to
cut
down
his
take
how
you
like
to
go
back
to
sime
and
try
explaining
to
his
highness
why
you
not
getting
out
as
much
stuff
as
been
proved
possible
that
stopped
them
cold
hanlon
watching
their
faces
and
reading
their
minds
saw
them
shiver
at
thought
of
having
to
face
that
feared
individual
whoever
he
was
they
were
more
scared
of
him
than
of
the
devil
that
was
evident
the
men
resumed
their
eating
without
another
word
that
threat
had
cowed
them
as
no
amount
of
physical
chastisement
or
other
punishment
could
possibly
have
done
philander
set
about
sewing
up
and
binding
and
his
cut
and
bleeding
face
hanlon
resumed
his
own
seat
after
washing
up
and
treating
his
own
bruises
with
the
cook
help
as
he
ate
he
sought
mind
after
mind
in
the
vain
endeavor
to
discover
any
possible
scrap
of
information
about
this
enigmatic
unknown
highness
but
he
drew
blank
after
blank
as
far
as
definite
data
was
concerned
just
as
he
had
always
done
the
surface
thoughts
of
each
man
there
showed
plainly
their
fear
of
that
implacably
cold
and
vicious
brain
but
none
of
them
held
a
picture
of
him
they
knew
no
excuses
for
failure
were
ever
accepted
they
knew
terrible
punishments
were
certain
to
follow
when
anyone
was
luckless
enough
to
incur
that
monster
displeasure
but
hanlon
shivered
himself
as
he
saw
how
clearly
those
hardened
criminals
feared
that
mysterious
man
displeasure
he
quailed
momentarily
at
thought
of
what
would
happen
to
him
if
he
were
caught
trying
to
locate
that
man
and
his
plot
hanlon
knew
a
long
moment
of
utter
discouragement
there
was
so
much
he
had
to
know
before
he
could
lead
the
corps
in
clearing
up
this
mess
there
had
been
so
many
mentions
of
a
main
plot
that
he
knew
this
illegal
mining
and
slavery
was
but
a
small
part
of
what
was
what
must
be
going
on
no
he
would
just
have
to
keep
on
trying
keep
on
working
on
second
thought
he
had
done
pretty
well
so
far
at
that
he
felt
he
had
a
right
to
feel
good
about
that
but
he
was
done
yet
by
a
whole
tankful
of
fuel
the
problem
stayed
with
him
even
in
sleep
but
in
the
morning
he
had
an
idea
as
soon
as
he
got
his
crew
down
into
the
mine
and
working
he
got
out
the
and
called
geck
to
him
can
you
find
out
what
is
happening
on
other
parts
of
guddu
the
native
answers
stunned
him
yes
all
we
can
with
any
guddu
anywhere
what
you
wish
to
know
chapter
the
knowledge
that
these
guddus
of
algon
were
telepathic
rocked
george
hanlon
back
on
his
heels
that
was
a
thing
he
had
never
even
imagined
they
were
such
a
simple
almost
childlike
race
that
such
an
ability
was
farthest
from
his
thoughts
if
you
can
talk
with
your
minds
he
asked
geck
in
wonder
why
do
you
bother
to
speak
with
the
voice
to
each
other
because
more
tiring
to
we
came
the
simple
explanation
it
take
much
of
we
forces
us
grow
weak
after
much
of
them
that
makes
me
hesitate
to
ask
you
to
do
any
of
it
then
the
young
ss
man
said
i
was
hoping
you
could
find
out
for
me
how
many
mines
are
operated
on
the
planet
and
if
all
of
them
are
using
you
guddus
as
slaves
oh
yes
me
know
that
already
geck
peculiar
little
face
which
had
become
so
friendly
to
hanlon
through
long
association
broke
out
into
a
smile
that
was
quickly
shadowed
by
sorrow
at
thought
of
the
plight
of
his
people
there
is
nine
mines
human
masters
make
guddu
work
in
all
of
they
nine
eh
hanlon
thought
swiftly
for
a
moment
do
they
all
produce
the
same
ores
as
this
one
will
have
to
find
that
for
you
you
wait
short
space
of
time
the
greenie
grew
silent
and
strained
with
concentration
hanlon
probed
into
the
native
mind
wondering
if
he
could
follow
it
and
haltingly
at
first
but
with
growing
ability
as
he
learned
the
pattern
he
found
he
could
ride
along
on
that
telepathic
beam
the
thoughts
were
far
too
swift
for
him
to
catch
more
than
an
occasional
concept
but
he
was
thrilled
to
realize
he
was
actually
telepathing
even
though
at
one
after
another
mind
he
could
feel
joining
in
that
conference
there
was
much
hostility
and
great
fear
when
geck
first
tried
to
explain
about
the
human
who
was
their
friend
and
had
learned
to
talk
with
them
the
guddus
on
the
other
end
of
that
line
were
tremendously
skeptical
afraid
and
very
very
suspicious
of
the
motives
of
any
human
being
but
geck
was
eloquent
and
persuasive
before
long
their
fears
began
to
lessen
and
later
they
seemed
to
accept
his
assurance
that
was
indeed
both
friendly
and
anxious
to
help
them
escape
their
slavery
the
human
is
but
one
of
the
most
of
humans
who
are
kind
and
just
and
ethical
he
was
surprised
to
hear
geck
telepathing
when
he
got
so
he
could
understand
it
is
the
few
such
as
those
others
who
are
here
who
are
not
these
are
bad
men
who
come
here
just
to
get
things
for
own
selfish
ends
and
the
good
men
who
are
most
will
stop
them
as
soon
as
they
can
come
here
just
for
that
to
find
out
what
those
bad
men
do
and
to
stop
them
that
speech
was
another
shock
to
hanlon
he
had
never
told
geck
all
that
the
distant
natives
finally
bowed
to
geck
importunings
and
gave
him
the
specific
information
for
which
he
was
asking
because
the
friendly
human
wanted
to
know
it
there
were
two
other
mines
that
produced
the
same
uraninite
ore
as
the
one
at
which
hanlon
was
stationed
there
were
three
iron
mines
and
hanlon
was
not
too
surprised
to
learn
that
at
each
of
these
mines
smelters
had
been
erected
he
learned
that
humans
were
used
mostly
in
the
mills
the
natives
being
used
only
for
outside
labor
because
they
could
not
stand
the
heat
we
burn
quickly
was
the
sad
horrified
thought
there
were
three
other
mines
but
the
natives
did
not
know
the
english
or
greek
names
for
the
metals
found
there
even
after
considerable
questioning
by
the
roundabout
hanlon
to
geck
to
the
guddus
back
to
geck
back
to
hanlon
method
he
still
could
get
that
specific
information
if
it
is
tiring
you
too
much
geck
please
ask
them
if
there
is
any
building
going
on
besides
the
smelters
at
the
iron
mines
hanlon
requested
soon
other
minds
about
the
planet
were
coming
in
and
the
story
began
to
unfold
there
were
several
factories
making
many
machines
but
none
of
the
natives
had
the
least
idea
what
kind
or
for
what
purpose
they
were
being
made
think
they
are
going
to
be
put
in
great
metal
huts
humans
are
making
one
thought
ran
and
hanlon
quickly
grabbed
onto
that
what
sort
of
metal
huts
things
that
look
like
huge
eggs
space
ships
you
mean
another
thought
broke
in
yes
they
like
ships
human
come
in
but
much
greater
hanlon
fumed
oh
if
only
he
could
see
but
wait
maybe
he
could
get
the
information
he
needed
ask
if
anyone
is
looking
at
one
of
those
right
now
he
commanded
geck
through
the
transformer
yes
many
guddu
right
at
edge
of
great
place
of
making
brother
of
me
nock
him
there
ask
him
please
to
describe
what
he
sees
maybe
that
will
give
me
a
good
picture
of
what
it
is
will
be
glad
to
try
but
not
knowing
your
language
and
having
no
compare
your
measurement
to
ours
am
not
sure
can
do
what
you
wish
he
felt
nock
say
this
too
surprised
hanlon
that
native
certainly
had
a
real
mind
to
grasp
that
difficulty
so
well
and
to
realize
the
limitations
of
telepathic
communications
with
one
alien
to
his
race
please
picture
it
in
your
mind
as
you
see
it
and
use
some
common
objects
of
the
planet
for
comparison
of
their
sizes
hanlon
urged
through
geck
mind
that
way
i
think
we
can
get
along
almost
instantly
a
picture
of
a
gigantic
egg
formed
in
his
mind
but
with
enough
variations
from
an
actual
egg
so
that
hanlon
realized
it
was
indeed
a
space
ship
the
native
was
viewing
soon
hanlon
saw
a
great
tree
pictured
beside
the
ship
and
at
the
base
of
the
tree
a
native
was
standing
quickly
hanlon
estimated
the
adult
natives
he
had
seen
were
almost
all
about
six
feet
tall
as
nearly
as
he
could
judge
that
tree
was
a
good
fifteen
times
the
height
of
the
guddu
and
the
ship
was
the
same
height
as
the
tree
and
nearly
three
times
as
long
wow
what
a
ship
but
it
must
be
wrong
even
the
largest
corps
warships
were
nowhere
near
that
huge
nor
were
even
any
of
the
biggest
freighters
he
had
ever
seen
he
must
be
getting
his
measurements
wrong
he
called
geck
using
the
transformer
are
you
seeing
what
i
am
in
nock
mind
yes
and
you
is
figure
right
is
that
big
hanlon
slowly
shook
his
head
in
amazement
if
that
was
meant
for
a
warship
it
certainly
spelled
trouble
for
someone
he
thought
seriously
for
several
moments
then
telepathed
nock
is
there
more
than
one
ship
being
built
oh
yes
there
are
many
many
the
picture
built
up
of
a
whole
row
of
ships
and
hanlon
counted
swiftly
for
what
purpose
was
such
a
fleet
being
built
men
would
not
defy
the
c
and
the
federated
planets
this
way
merely
for
business
reasons
he
felt
sure
there
certainly
was
a
plot
being
hatched
and
what
a
plot
he
felt
geck
hand
on
his
arm
and
heard
his
voice
are
two
more
places
where
humans
build
many
ship
while
you
think
me
talk
many
minds
one
place
are
fourteen
more
great
ones
at
other
are
many
many
many
small
ones
five
to
ten
guddu
long
shock
on
shock
someone
was
building
a
tremendous
fleet
here
he
must
get
that
news
to
corps
headquarters
as
quickly
as
possible
if
those
ships
were
once
finished
they
would
be
able
to
dominate
the
system
for
the
corps
had
only
a
nominal
fleet
they
had
never
needed
a
large
one
to
the
best
of
his
knowledge
the
corps
had
only
battleships
much
smaller
than
these
the
fleet
also
had
fifty
heavy
cruisers
a
hundred
and
fifty
light
cruisers
and
a
thousand
scouts
running
from
up
to
size
please
find
out
if
any
of
those
ships
they
are
building
have
ever
left
the
ground
some
little
ones
only
geck
reported
after
awhile
some
few
disappear
into
sky
then
come
back
after
time
then
do
same
again
trial
trips
or
training
trips
for
the
crews
hanlon
deduced
well
he
had
some
data
now
at
least
enough
so
that
once
he
got
that
news
to
headquarters
they
would
attack
this
place
in
force
great
enough
to
stop
this
work
if
he
could
get
word
to
them
soon
enough
let
see
now
he
figured
quickly
i
been
here
almost
twelve
weeks
that
means
another
six
or
seven
until
i
supposed
to
be
eligible
to
get
back
to
simonides
hmmm
wish
i
knew
how
near
finished
those
big
are
more
moments
of
intense
thought
i
do
dare
take
the
chance
of
trying
to
sneak
off
to
the
yards
he
reasoned
logically
i
got
to
do
everything
i
can
to
make
sure
i
get
my
trip
back
when
my
eighteen
weeks
are
up
if
i
got
caught
off
bounds
that
would
ruin
everything
really
be
in
a
mess
also
even
if
he
could
get
to
the
shipyards
the
moment
he
was
spotted
trying
to
get
inside
any
of
those
ships
he
would
undoubtedly
be
killed
by
guards
who
would
certainly
shoot
first
and
ask
questions
later
if
any
nor
were
there
any
longer
any
native
birds
or
animals
left
on
algon
he
could
use
he
had
learned
that
the
men
had
killed
them
off
soon
after
they
arrived
no
i
just
have
to
keep
on
trying
and
get
what
dope
i
can
without
exposing
myself
with
a
month
and
a
half
i
should
be
able
to
get
a
lot
more
and
with
what
i
already
know
the
corps
top
brass
will
take
steps
but
fast
suddenly
a
new
idea
sprang
into
his
mind
where
was
here
in
his
excitement
and
planning
he
had
entirely
forgotten
to
finish
figuring
out
that
point
that
evening
after
dinner
he
stayed
outside
ostensibly
walking
about
aimlessly
in
reality
looking
at
and
studying
the
stars
when
he
was
sure
no
one
was
watching
him
he
could
spot
any
of
the
more
familiar
constellations
such
as
the
big
dipper
bear
or
the
southern
cross
he
knew
he
was
far
to
one
side
of
the
galaxy
from
terra
that
while
from
there
one
could
see
the
front
of
those
configurations
now
he
would
be
getting
a
sidewise
view
but
he
could
identify
quite
a
few
of
the
bigger
suns
and
distant
nebulae
he
picked
out
several
and
red
giants
he
was
sure
he
knew
that
was
andromeda
off
there
that
one
was
undoubtedly
orion
no
other
contained
so
many
to
stars
beside
the
gigantic
rigel
betelgeuse
and
bellatrix
good
he
could
fix
all
that
in
his
mind
well
enough
to
draw
it
when
he
got
back
and
the
corps
planetographers
certainly
would
this
system
from
those
directions
distance
let
see
he
strained
to
remember
the
time
it
had
taken
that
freighter
to
come
here
and
estimated
that
with
its
slower
speed
this
world
was
somewhere
between
ten
and
fifteen
lights
he
would
time
it
more
carefully
going
back
and
estimate
the
ship
speed
as
closely
as
possible
young
george
hanlon
was
maturing
swiftly
under
the
stress
of
the
tremendous
task
he
was
attempting
he
was
learning
that
he
must
think
and
plan
well
ahead
of
time
he
realized
he
could
not
afford
to
make
any
serious
mistakes
lest
not
only
his
task
remain
uncompleted
but
his
life
be
forfeit
as
well
he
knew
now
that
it
was
absolutely
imperative
that
he
get
back
to
simonides
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
and
that
the
way
to
be
sure
of
this
was
to
so
impress
philander
that
he
would
feel
to
give
hanlon
his
vacation
at
end
of
the
minimum
time
so
hanlon
devoted
many
hours
of
serious
thought
to
this
problem
and
finally
figured
out
several
courses
of
action
the
next
day
as
soon
as
his
shift
was
over
hanlon
walked
across
the
compound
and
knocked
on
the
door
of
the
headquarters
office
when
bade
to
enter
he
did
so
hat
in
hand
have
you
got
a
half
hour
or
so
to
talk
philander
sir
he
asked
i
got
a
couple
of
ideas
i
like
to
gab
with
you
about
that
i
think
might
speed
up
production
even
more
the
man
looked
up
in
surprise
and
his
eyes
bored
deeply
suspiciously
into
hanlon
you
think
you
can
tell
me
how
to
run
my
job
he
rasped
oh
no
sir
i
did
mean
about
the
engineering
or
supervision
about
handling
the
natives
and
getting
more
out
of
them
you
said
i
was
getting
out
more
ore
than
the
others
and
i
think
perhaps
i
got
a
few
ideas
a
sort
of
hunch
about
making
the
greenies
themselves
more
productive
well
come
in
come
in
then
what
is
it
i
been
doing
a
lot
of
thinking
about
the
greenies
sir
you
remember
i
thought
they
were
vegetable
matter
and
the
way
they
feed
themselves
they
need
ground
that
either
has
lots
of
natural
chemicals
in
it
or
that
has
been
to
keep
well
and
strong
that
being
the
case
the
dirt
that
forms
the
floors
of
their
huts
and
stockades
would
very
quickly
become
exhausted
of
those
vital
chemicals
and
the
natives
would
begin
suffering
from
malnutrition
it
seems
to
me
my
gang
has
been
slowing
down
recently
although
they
still
seem
to
be
trying
as
hard
as
ever
why
why
yes
the
superintendent
eyes
had
widened
in
surprise
as
hanlon
talked
that
makes
sense
imagine
none
of
us
thinking
of
that
but
then
we
always
thought
of
them
merely
as
dumb
beasts
so
i
been
wondering
if
it
would
be
a
good
idea
either
to
move
the
stockades
every
month
or
so
or
else
let
the
natives
out
in
the
open
jungle
every
day
the
sunlight
would
probably
help
them
too
being
vegetable
they
could
be
tied
together
and
guarded
of
course
so
they
could
escape
philander
slumped
down
into
his
chair
in
deep
thought
and
hanlon
glowed
inwardly
with
the
hope
that
something
would
come
of
this
plan
it
would
help
him
with
philander
if
it
worked
also
it
would
help
the
guddus
for
geek
had
often
grown
almost
hysterical
when
complaining
about
the
terrible
hunger
they
all
felt
so
continuously
suddenly
philander
sat
erect
i
believe
we
got
a
few
sacks
of
commercial
nitrates
in
the
storehouse
let
experiment
and
see
if
they
can
use
that
he
rose
purposefully
from
his
desk
and
the
two
hurried
to
one
of
the
warehouses
there
philander
soon
found
the
sacks
of
chemical
and
hanlon
carried
one
as
they
went
to
the
corral
may
we
try
it
on
my
crew
first
sir
he
asked
anxiously
they
seem
to
sort
of
like
me
and
i
learned
more
or
less
how
to
guess
their
reactions
by
their
facial
movements
so
i
think
i
could
tell
whether
they
like
it
or
not
sure
that
a
good
idea
and
they
went
on
to
the
compound
that
housed
hanlon
special
crew
inside
while
hanlon
apparently
chose
at
random
it
was
actually
geck
to
whom
he
beckoned
when
the
native
approached
feigning
fear
and
reluctance
hanlon
hid
a
sudden
grin
at
geck
unexpected
acting
brilliance
the
young
man
opened
the
sack
and
poured
out
a
little
of
the
nitrate
he
stooped
over
and
stuck
his
fingers
into
the
stuff
then
rose
and
gestured
to
geck
to
put
his
feeding
fingers
into
it
the
same
way
meanwhile
hanlon
was
telepathing
the
exact
information
to
his
friend
as
best
he
could
with
his
limited
ability
gingerly
geck
stooped
and
after
a
few
false
starts
finally
put
one
of
his
fingers
into
the
little
pile
of
nitrate
and
activated
the
feeding
sensories
for
a
few
moments
he
stood
thus
doubtfully
then
his
manner
clearly
indicated
joy
and
surprised
happiness
he
began
working
that
little
mouth
and
the
others
crowded
closer
telepathically
he
informed
hanlon
that
this
was
wonderful
exactly
the
food
element
the
natives
needed
so
desperately
it
seems
to
think
it
all
okay
hanlon
said
aloud
to
philander
spread
out
a
little
more
for
them
all
and
without
waiting
for
permission
he
made
a
long
narrow
pile
of
the
fertilizer
clear
across
the
width
of
the
hut
instantly
the
rest
of
the
natives
crowded
along
that
line
and
stuck
their
feeding
fingers
into
it
soon
their
faces
expressed
their
equivalent
of
blissful
smiles
of
complete
satisfaction
and
hanlon
mind
was
suffused
with
thoughts
of
pleasure
and
gratitude
for
his
kindness
chapter
superintendent
philander
stood
watching
the
natives
feeding
and
he
could
not
help
seeing
how
they
appeared
to
appreciate
the
new
food
after
some
time
he
said
admiringly
it
looks
like
you
hit
on
something
george
if
it
continues
to
work
out
we
feed
all
of
this
stuff
and
i
requisition
plenty
more
next
time
the
freighter
comes
in
they
left
the
compound
carefully
locking
both
gates
behind
them
and
walked
back
to
the
office
once
there
hanlon
said
i
see
you
have
a
chess
set
sir
do
you
play
i
love
the
game
you
do
philander
eyes
gleamed
it
been
a
long
time
since
there
was
anyone
here
who
did
then
i
hope
you
let
me
come
in
occasionally
for
a
game
i
get
lonesome
here
the
other
guards
are
worth
talking
to
and
i
not
educated
enough
in
science
or
technology
to
get
in
on
the
arguments
of
the
engineers
and
other
technies
sure
sure
come
in
any
time
i
be
mighty
glad
to
have
you
for
i
love
chess
i
get
lonesome
too
and
i
have
to
stay
a
whole
year
at
a
time
feel
free
to
come
in
any
evening
back
in
his
room
hanlon
left
tremendously
satisfied
with
the
work
he
had
done
something
for
the
natives
that
would
help
make
their
intolerable
situation
more
bearable
until
the
time
came
when
they
could
be
freed
of
their
slavery
and
he
had
made
a
new
friend
who
could
prove
very
useful
he
was
very
anxious
for
the
next
to
come
so
he
could
talk
to
geck
via
the
for
he
was
not
yet
adept
enough
at
telepathy
to
be
sure
he
had
got
all
the
information
needed
about
the
use
of
nitrates
in
the
guddu
diet
but
the
next
day
when
he
went
to
herd
his
crew
from
their
compound
and
down
into
the
mine
he
could
not
help
noticing
at
first
glance
how
much
sprightlier
they
looked
than
the
other
crews
the
minute
they
had
reached
the
stope
he
unearthed
the
machine
from
its
hiding
place
and
got
into
conversation
with
the
friendly
guddu
the
food
stuff
he
asked
eagerly
is
it
something
you
can
use
oh
yes
geck
almost
sputtered
in
his
eagerness
and
words
tumbled
out
so
swiftly
hanlon
could
hardly
translate
them
it
are
wonderful
can
you
fix
so
all
we
can
have
yes
they
all
be
fed
rations
of
it
from
now
on
although
perhaps
not
much
until
the
ship
can
bring
more
from
another
planet
i
do
know
how
much
we
have
on
hand
but
the
liked
my
idea
and
is
going
to
see
to
it
that
there
is
always
some
on
hand
for
all
the
natives
probably
spread
the
word
to
the
other
mines
and
factories
too
almost
us
ingest
too
many
last
dark
geck
gave
what
hanlon
knew
was
a
shamefaced
laugh
it
such
very
good
eat
us
become
he
hesitated
drunk
you
mean
hanlon
laughed
i
can
see
it
might
do
that
to
you
you
have
to
warn
the
others
about
that
they
chatted
away
for
some
minutes
about
how
much
the
guddus
appreciated
hanlon
thoughtfulness
say
i
just
wondered
hanlon
interrupted
geck
thanks
do
you
have
any
idea
where
your
planet
is
located
in
space
i
mean
do
you
know
the
suns
closest
to
yours
anything
about
their
distances
or
magnitudes
geck
thoughts
and
expression
were
a
blank
and
it
took
most
of
the
even
to
make
him
understand
what
hanlon
was
trying
to
ask
when
he
did
finally
manage
to
grasp
the
his
answer
was
a
decided
negative
no
us
know
nothing
about
other
sun
other
planet
before
humans
come
suppose
we
only
intelligent
life
anywhere
things
you
call
suns
us
thought
little
fires
light
sky
at
night
wonder
many
night
who
build
wonder
what
is
burn
where
is
nothing
wonder
why
only
one
big
fire
come
day
wonder
why
big
fire
die
come
night
hanlon
disappointment
about
that
was
tempered
somewhat
when
the
checker
came
running
into
his
room
where
he
was
resting
before
dinner
to
tell
him
that
his
crew
had
suddenly
got
out
almost
half
a
ton
more
ore
that
day
than
any
previous
record
he
had
made
a
new
cook
had
come
to
the
mine
recently
he
had
a
fox
terrier
and
hanlon
got
into
the
habit
of
playing
with
the
dog
to
keep
up
his
ability
to
handle
animal
minds
and
to
learn
more
of
the
technique
he
was
always
careful
to
say
out
loud
the
command
for
whatever
trick
he
wanted
the
animal
to
perform
but
actually
he
was
controlling
its
brain
and
nerves
and
muscles
one
evening
he
was
working
thus
with
the
dog
when
gorton
his
still
bandaged
came
into
the
messhall
seeing
hanlon
with
the
terrier
his
heavy
lip
curled
so
th
boy
also
a
animal
trainer
eh
that
he
is
cookie
said
from
the
doorway
leading
into
the
kitchen
and
good
too
he
got
brutus
doing
things
i
never
knew
a
dog
could
do
gorton
sneered
again
teachin
tricks
t
a
dog
is
kid
stuff
can
you
do
it
the
cook
asked
sarcastically
who
bother
t
try
hanlon
looked
up
blandly
you
could
expect
that
of
gorton
cookie
to
teach
an
animal
to
do
tricks
you
have
to
know
more
than
it
does
why
you
gorton
started
forward
his
face
aflame
while
the
other
men
roared
with
laughter
at
the
rough
wit
but
the
big
guard
did
not
reach
hanlon
one
of
the
newer
guards
a
giant
swede
named
jenssen
stopped
him
aw
lay
off
the
kid
gort
he
okay
that
stunt
of
feeding
the
greenies
fertilizer
makes
turn
out
lots
more
work
and
we
get
us
bigger
bonuses
of
it
but
gorton
was
not
the
type
to
know
when
to
quit
nor
was
he
high
enough
in
the
ethical
scale
to
know
appreciation
for
the
fact
that
it
was
the
very
man
he
had
been
reviling
who
was
the
first
to
go
to
his
aid
when
he
was
hurt
hanlon
had
come
to
realize
that
the
big
man
was
determined
to
provoke
him
to
another
fight
he
knew
that
tempers
were
edgy
and
explosive
in
this
enervating
heat
and
usually
tried
to
bear
gorton
insults
and
petty
meannesses
in
silence
he
would
demean
himself
by
descending
to
the
big
guard
low
level
although
occasionally
when
the
heat
was
too
much
even
for
him
as
tonight
he
could
resist
making
some
answer
gorton
he
had
long
since
decided
was
one
of
those
men
who
having
nothing
of
worth
to
offer
the
world
did
their
utmost
to
tear
down
and
humiliate
anyone
who
had
and
his
smallness
of
soul
and
intellect
were
shown
by
the
sort
of
tricks
he
was
continually
pulling
thinking
them
smart
such
as
scrawling
with
chalk
on
hanlon
room
door
super
pet
continually
upsetting
hanlon
beverage
cup
or
accidentally
dropping
things
in
hanlon
plate
of
food
the
young
ss
man
could
have
moved
to
another
place
at
the
table
but
he
would
give
the
big
guard
that
satisfaction
but
one
of
gorton
tricks
backfired
to
such
an
extent
that
it
had
disastrous
results
for
gorton
himself
that
was
the
night
he
knowing
that
hanlon
had
been
the
last
at
the
compound
sneaked
out
and
unlocked
all
the
gates
he
figured
of
course
that
it
would
be
apparent
to
everyone
that
it
was
hanlon
rank
carelessness
that
had
allowed
all
the
greenies
to
escape
but
to
the
surprise
of
everyone
except
hanlon
not
a
single
one
had
left
all
were
inside
their
huts
the
next
morning
philander
came
running
when
he
heard
about
it
who
did
it
he
demanded
angrily
th
punk
there
o
course
gorton
sneered
philander
swivelled
about
surprise
on
his
face
you
george
did
you
forget
to
lock
the
gates
no
sir
i
locked
them
all
when
i
went
in
to
dinner
he
lyin
he
was
th
last
one
t
bring
up
his
gang
that
true
i
was
but
i
know
i
locked
all
the
gates
very
carefully
as
always
one
of
the
engineers
spoke
up
i
saw
him
doing
it
pete
i
also
saw
one
of
the
other
guards
leave
the
messhall
for
a
few
minutes
just
before
we
sat
down
to
eat
when
he
came
back
i
saw
him
grinning
mysteriously
as
though
very
about
something
who
was
that
sorry
i
name
no
names
i
tell
big
jenssen
spoke
up
it
was
gort
he
got
it
in
for
george
he
one
big
fool
philander
wheeled
in
rage
i
told
you
you
brainless
slob
to
leave
hanlon
alone
and
by
jupiter
i
mean
it
cut
it
out
one
more
stunt
and
you
go
into
irons
then
back
to
sime
for
an
interview
with
his
highness
you
go
back
next
trip
anyway
i
done
with
you
the
rest
of
the
men
stood
by
in
hostile
silence
and
it
was
clear
from
their
attitudes
that
this
time
gorton
had
gone
too
far
how
it
happened
none
of
the
natives
had
run
away
puzzled
them
all
but
hanlon
guessed
and
when
he
had
taken
his
crew
down
to
work
he
called
geck
to
him
and
by
means
of
the
transformer
asked
about
it
was
one
guddu
in
hut
by
main
gate
who
first
see
gate
were
open
him
all
we
to
run
far
into
forest
this
crew
us
stop
all
they
tell
other
guddu
how
kind
are
you
how
you
get
we
tell
how
you
work
to
make
all
we
free
make
free
all
guddu
everywhere
us
say
maybe
so
we
all
get
free
now
small
time
but
say
come
humans
with
hunt
we
hurt
we
make
we
work
more
hard
be
more
cruel
to
we
say
then
plan
of
you
never
get
chance
to
make
all
we
free
all
time
hanlon
bowed
his
head
in
silent
thanks
for
the
tremendous
compliment
i
only
hope
i
can
justify
your
faith
in
me
geck
he
said
humbly
it
will
be
a
miracle
if
i
can
bring
it
about
but
i
certainly
intend
to
keep
on
trying
it
will
take
some
time
you
know
that
i
ca
possibly
do
anything
until
after
i
leave
here
but
if
it
humanly
possible
bring
the
fleet
here
to
free
you
us
know
will
be
hard
that
maybeso
it
never
come
we
be
free
the
guddu
said
but
us
know
you
are
only
hope
so
us
help
you
all
us
can
guddu
in
mines
try
get
more
rock
out
as
you
say
but
guddu
who
help
humans
build
big
egg
you
call
do
most
each
day
some
of
they
find
way
break
something
do
wrong
thing
two
guddu
spoil
much
metal
when
jump
in
vat
where
metal
be
melt
oh
no
hanlon
cried
in
shocked
anguish
that
was
wonderfully
brave
of
them
but
none
of
the
others
must
ever
do
things
like
that
tell
them
not
to
sacrifice
their
lives
that
way
i
feel
sure
from
all
the
reports
it
is
needed
i
be
going
back
in
another
few
weeks
and
the
humans
wo
have
any
of
those
biggest
ships
ready
by
then
those
are
the
only
ones
we
need
to
fear
the
little
ships
do
count
it
was
too
bad
hanlon
did
not
know
what
else
the
humans
were
building
besides
ships
at
the
shipyards
hanlon
campaign
to
get
in
good
with
philander
was
bearing
tasty
fruit
for
the
two
were
becoming
fast
friends
they
spent
many
evenings
over
a
chess
board
it
was
plain
now
that
the
nervous
worried
superintendent
felt
he
could
relax
in
the
company
of
this
young
naive
guard
for
the
latter
was
so
patently
no
challenge
to
his
position
besides
it
was
also
very
evident
that
he
liked
hanlon
as
a
man
day
by
day
his
attitude
grew
more
fatherly
hanlon
on
his
part
came
to
realize
more
the
true
innate
measure
of
philander
inherent
worth
as
a
man
a
gentleman
and
an
engineer
he
had
a
fine
mind
was
well
read
and
thought
deeply
on
many
subjects
outside
his
own
technical
line
all
he
needs
are
some
psychiatric
treatments
to
reduce
that
awful
inferiority
complex
of
his
hanlon
mused
one
night
as
he
walked
back
slowly
to
his
room
then
he
really
be
the
big
fine
man
he
capable
of
being
and
will
forget
all
this
conspiracy
nonsense
thus
hanlon
felt
he
was
taking
no
special
chance
one
night
when
the
two
were
standing
on
the
little
porch
of
the
office
their
game
ended
and
hanlon
about
to
leave
he
glanced
up
at
the
brilliant
night
sky
sure
looks
different
here
than
it
does
back
on
terra
he
said
conversationally
naturally
it
would
seeing
we
so
far
away
from
there
but
i
never
get
tired
of
looking
at
it
and
trying
to
see
if
i
can
figure
out
some
of
the
brighter
suns
he
pointed
to
one
bright
star
directly
overhead
that
sirius
i
know
it
always
directly
above
you
philander
laughed
heartily
no
sirius
is
almost
exactly
opposite
do
forget
we
about
a
hundred
light
years
out
from
sol
hanlon
made
himself
look
crestfallen
and
there
i
was
sure
i
knew
one
of
at
least
he
yawned
pretentiously
well
guess
i
hit
the
hay
reckon
the
stars
stay
put
whether
i
can
pick
out
or
not
philander
laughed
again
and
clapped
him
on
the
back
in
comradely
fashion
i
would
wonder
goodnight
george
mr
philander
and
as
hanlon
walked
back
to
his
own
room
his
heart
was
light
he
learned
another
important
fact
about
their
location
in
space
the
approximate
distance
from
sol
chapter
a
few
nights
later
one
of
the
junior
engineers
came
running
into
the
office
where
hanlon
and
philander
were
playing
chess
trouble
down
in
stope
four
he
gasped
philander
jumped
up
upsetting
the
board
he
grabbed
his
and
started
out
want
me
along
sir
hanlon
asked
might
as
well
and
hanlon
ran
with
them
down
in
the
mine
they
found
after
examination
that
it
was
not
as
bad
as
it
at
first
seemed
some
timbers
had
rotted
away
or
had
not
been
good
wood
in
the
first
place
and
a
rock
fall
had
occurred
but
once
they
started
working
at
it
they
found
it
not
too
big
hanlon
was
sent
running
for
the
rest
of
the
men
and
in
a
few
hours
everything
was
all
tight
again
back
in
the
office
hanlon
picked
up
the
fallen
chess
pieces
while
philander
and
the
engineers
talked
for
some
time
when
they
left
hanlon
asked
want
to
finish
the
game
or
rather
since
the
board
was
upset
want
to
play
another
better
make
it
a
i
got
some
paper
work
i
should
do
make
it
tomorrow
that
okay
with
me
i
go
hit
the
hay
thanks
for
your
help
tonight
george
you
pitched
in
so
gladly
while
the
others
were
surly
and
grumbling
it
was
very
noticeable
and
i
appreciate
it
you
a
good
kid
wish
i
had
one
just
like
you
hanlon
flushed
a
bit
and
could
meet
his
friend
eye
to
eye
i
was
glad
to
do
it
he
said
lamely
and
he
ran
out
blast
it
he
thought
i
hate
using
pete
that
way
he
really
a
swell
egg
underneath
but
the
job
more
important
a
few
nights
later
they
had
finished
the
second
game
and
the
elder
had
won
both
he
was
consequently
in
very
good
humor
for
the
two
were
so
evenly
matched
it
was
seldom
either
ever
won
two
games
in
the
same
evening
philander
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
smiled
at
the
younger
man
well
george
the
freighter
be
here
in
three
days
and
i
sending
you
back
for
your
vacation
gee
thanks
chief
that
swell
of
you
i
going
to
miss
you
but
i
admit
i
be
glad
to
get
away
from
this
awful
climate
for
a
while
this
place
sure
gets
my
goat
i
ca
seem
to
get
used
to
it
all
then
you
wo
want
to
come
back
there
was
disappointment
in
the
question
oh
no
i
did
mean
that
i
sure
will
be
back
if
i
can
make
it
maybe
this
job
is
exactly
what
i
dreamed
about
he
had
to
hedge
that
statement
a
bit
and
tried
to
make
a
explanation
but
that
thousand
credits
a
month
is
that
reminds
me
i
want
to
be
sure
to
recommend
you
for
a
good
bonus
you
deserve
it
any
guard
we
ever
had
here
then
too
your
ideas
of
rotating
your
crew
and
especially
that
fertilizer
deal
have
raised
the
effective
and
speed
of
the
natives
almost
thirty
percent
i
figured
it
out
and
they
be
getting
off
cheap
if
they
give
you
what
i
recommending
two
months
pay
as
a
bonus
yowie
hanlon
yelled
making
his
face
show
excitement
and
that
curious
avarice
he
had
so
carefully
built
up
in
these
suspicious
minds
that
make
me
six
thou
in
four
months
i
be
rich
yet
you
and
your
urge
for
money
philander
laughed
yet
there
was
a
curious
undertone
of
in
his
voice
why
you
so
hipped
on
that
subject
hanlon
grinned
and
misquoted
life
is
real
life
is
earnest
and
the
gravy
is
my
goal
then
he
sobered
and
said
with
money
you
can
do
anything
when
i
made
a
big
pile
then
i
can
go
where
i
want
to
go
be
what
i
want
to
be
and
make
people
know
i
somebody
philander
shrugged
maybe
you
right
but
i
say
there
were
better
ways
george
hanlon
looked
doubtful
i
have
the
utmost
respect
for
your
ideas
and
greater
experience
sir
but
what
better
than
a
big
wad
of
credits
philander
looked
more
seriously
thoughtful
than
hanlon
had
ever
seen
him
before
he
was
silent
a
moment
then
answered
slowly
this
may
sound
but
i
believe
steady
advancement
in
whatever
work
you
choose
growing
knowledge
of
many
things
creative
imagination
put
to
constructive
use
the
growing
respect
and
consequent
advance
in
responsibility
from
your
employers
if
you
working
for
someone
or
from
your
neighbors
if
you
in
business
for
yourself
those
things
are
in
my
opinion
of
much
greater
value
than
the
mere
accumulation
of
money
and
the
best
part
of
it
is
that
if
you
grow
in
those
ways
that
extra
money
will
come
to
you
but
merely
as
a
corollary
addition
to
the
greater
achievements
i
see
your
point
hanlon
was
greatly
impressed
by
earnestness
maybe
you
right
i
still
just
a
kid
i
guess
with
a
kid
immature
outlook
that
why
i
appreciate
your
friendship
and
advice
so
much
sir
you
been
almost
like
a
second
father
to
me
this
was
honest
he
liked
philander
now
more
than
ever
the
look
on
the
elder
face
too
defied
description
but
that
he
was
secretly
pleased
was
evident
well
run
along
then
and
i
get
at
that
letter
meanwhile
get
your
things
packed
so
you
be
ready
to
leave
when
the
ship
comes
and
george
my
boy
i
do
hope
you
come
back
it
be
mighty
lonely
here
without
you
i
certainly
do
my
best
to
get
back
sir
goodnight
and
thanks
again
for
everything
hanlon
hated
that
seeming
lie
and
as
he
walked
slowly
back
to
his
room
he
determined
to
get
the
man
away
from
those
plotters
and
into
a
better
and
more
legitimate
position
he
would
certainly
so
recommend
to
the
secret
service
high
command
after
this
mess
was
cleaned
up
the
next
days
hanlon
spent
almost
his
entire
underground
talking
earnestly
to
geck
i
want
to
impress
on
the
minds
of
you
and
all
the
natives
here
that
i
be
working
my
hardest
for
them
every
minute
i
gone
he
said
impressively
do
let
them
do
anything
foolish
unless
or
until
it
becomes
completely
sure
that
i
failed
if
i
can
do
anything
at
all
it
should
be
within
a
quarter
year
after
i
leave
and
probably
much
sooner
if
i
succeed
you
all
be
free
and
these
men
either
chased
off
your
planet
or
killed
all
we
understand
we
know
you
are
true
friend
know
you
want
to
help
us
we
will
keep
working
make
no
attempts
to
escape
we
know
if
do
we
just
be
killed
or
hunted
and
caught
again
condition
of
we
before
you
come
so
bad
we
had
come
to
feel
only
end
for
us
be
death
of
race
now
you
bring
hope
now
we
know
most
humans
good
people
so
we
wait
in
hope
you
soon
succeed
that
the
spirit
i
know
it
tough
on
all
of
you
but
i
also
know
what
the
corps
is
and
what
they
can
and
will
do
when
they
learn
of
your
plight
he
linked
his
mind
with
geck
as
the
latter
telepathed
the
natives
in
other
parts
of
the
planet
and
was
thus
enabled
to
get
final
descriptions
of
what
they
could
tell
of
what
was
being
done
at
each
mine
and
factory
and
shipyard
he
knew
exactly
how
many
ships
had
been
built
or
were
under
construction
and
approximately
how
far
along
the
hulls
of
the
big
ones
were
completed
he
was
also
able
to
get
a
very
good
general
knowledge
of
the
size
and
structural
description
of
each
type
of
vessel
but
of
their
armaments
or
propulsive
methods
he
had
not
been
able
to
get
any
information
such
things
were
too
far
beyond
the
natives
simple
abilities
to
describe
or
picture
for
him
hanlon
ability
to
telepath
through
geck
was
growing
much
stronger
although
he
was
still
not
able
to
telepath
direct
to
any
of
the
distant
guddus
he
could
however
do
so
to
some
extent
to
one
close
by
but
he
still
could
not
read
anything
in
a
human
mind
except
the
surface
thoughts
and
how
he
could
use
that
ability
with
that
his
task
would
be
much
simpler
but
he
had
learned
to
be
content
with
what
he
had
realizing
it
was
undoubtedly
unique
in
human
history
it
had
brought
him
this
far
along
and
he
had
collected
a
lot
of
information
which
he
could
not
have
gained
in
any
other
manner
information
that
he
could
report
to
the
corps
as
soon
as
he
got
back
to
simonides
and
had
the
chance
to
go
to
the
bank
or
contact
them
in
some
other
way
liberation
day
as
hanlon
had
taken
to
calling
it
in
his
mind
finally
arrived
he
was
all
packed
and
waiting
for
the
ship
when
it
was
sighted
he
and
philander
went
to
the
field
to
meet
it
when
the
captain
came
out
the
three
stood
in
conversation
while
the
crew
hurriedly
unloaded
the
supplies
they
had
brought
and
those
leaving
had
gone
aboard
the
captain
handed
philander
some
letters
but
the
latter
shoved
them
in
his
pocket
for
the
time
beings
without
stopping
to
look
at
them
finally
it
was
time
for
and
hanlon
said
his
last
farewells
to
the
superintendent
then
went
in
to
stow
his
bags
in
his
stateroom
and
prepare
for
he
had
expected
to
be
locked
in
again
and
merely
tried
the
door
out
of
curiosity
but
to
his
surprise
it
was
locked
so
he
went
out
he
was
wise
enough
not
to
attempt
to
invade
the
control
room
but
did
hunt
up
a
and
strap
himself
into
the
chair
before
it
he
manipulated
the
dials
and
had
just
got
an
outside
view
as
the
pilot
began
activating
the
tubes
hanlon
saw
philander
come
running
from
the
little
path
through
the
jungle
back
toward
the
field
waving
a
letter
trying
to
attract
attention
but
evidently
neither
the
captain
pilot
nor
any
watch
officer
saw
him
for
at
that
moment
the
great
wash
of
flame
from
the
tubes
blotted
out
the
scene
and
hanlon
was
forced
deeply
into
his
acceleration
chair
as
the
ship
lifted
gravs
the
trip
back
was
uneventful
hanlon
kept
careful
track
of
the
time
and
strained
all
his
spaceman
senses
properly
to
evaluate
their
speed
as
the
ship
braked
for
the
landing
on
simonides
he
completed
his
calculations
and
was
quite
sure
the
distance
between
the
two
planets
was
twelve
and
a
quarter
light
years
plus
or
minus
not
over
two
percent
and
that
algon
was
somewhere
near
right
ascension
eighteen
hours
and
declination
plus
fifteen
degrees
as
he
passed
through
the
airlock
and
started
down
the
plank
he
was
surprised
and
a
bit
dismayed
to
see
panek
and
two
of
the
other
gunmen
he
had
seen
in
that
back
room
waiting
for
him
their
faces
impassive
and
unreadable
a
welcoming
committee
eh
he
greeted
them
with
a
smile
that
tried
to
cover
his
disappointment
hiya
panek
hi
fellows
but
his
heart
was
doing
these
men
were
not
here
just
because
they
were
glad
to
see
him
of
that
he
was
sure
he
probed
their
minds
and
even
before
panek
spoke
he
knew
the
boss
sent
us
to
bring
you
to
see
him
first
thing
the
boss
did
panek
voice
was
gruff
yet
somewhat
friendly
that
mighty
nice
of
him
hanlon
tried
not
to
let
his
feelings
show
but
to
take
this
as
a
natural
courtesy
but
he
had
so
much
wanted
to
get
to
the
bank
immediately
i
was
coming
to
report
of
course
he
commented
got
a
letter
for
him
from
superintendent
philander
besides
i
got
a
flock
of
credits
coming
boy
did
i
earn
that
a
stinking
hot
planet
up
there
it
be
good
seeing
the
bright
lights
again
besides
living
in
a
decent
climate
once
more
the
two
men
grunted
a
mysterious
laugh
but
panek
merely
indicated
the
way
to
the
aircar
again
hanlon
was
blindfolded
but
now
he
care
he
knew
the
location
of
this
crater
field
there
was
silence
during
most
of
the
trip
hanlon
babbled
away
at
first
but
when
no
one
answered
him
he
gradually
slowed
his
words
and
finally
shut
up
entirely
his
mind
probings
told
him
he
was
in
for
a
rough
time
and
he
got
the
feeling
he
was
not
supposed
to
be
there
at
all
for
some
reason
oh
oh
he
thought
almost
in
panic
something
wrong
did
i
slip
somewhere
have
they
got
wind
of
what
i
learned
but
how
how
could
they
instead
of
taking
him
to
the
back
room
of
the
bacchus
hanlon
found
when
the
blindfold
was
finally
removed
that
he
was
in
a
room
that
he
sensed
was
a
sort
of
cellar
in
some
huge
building
it
was
bare
of
furniture
except
for
two
chairs
and
the
one
of
which
was
on
a
standard
like
a
spotlight
before
he
had
time
to
try
to
puzzle
things
out
the
door
opened
and
the
man
he
had
thought
of
merely
as
the
leader
came
in
and
sat
down
in
one
of
the
chairs
he
gestured
and
the
men
pushed
hanlon
into
the
facing
seat
and
adjusted
the
so
it
shone
in
his
eyes
then
ranged
themselves
behind
him
so
you
got
back
the
leader
said
softly
sure
hanlon
made
himself
act
as
though
nothing
was
out
of
the
way
but
it
was
an
effort
to
smile
and
talk
naturally
when
his
mouth
was
suddenly
dry
and
his
nerves
tightened
almost
to
the
screaming
point
my
time
was
up
so
philander
sent
me
back
i
got
a
letter
for
you
from
him
he
started
to
reach
into
his
pocket
but
panek
slapped
his
hand
down
and
snaked
the
letter
out
handing
it
to
the
leader
who
opened
it
and
read
it
silently
then
the
man
looked
up
his
face
puzzled
you
seem
to
have
uh
done
very
well
there
he
said
almost
pleasantly
our
superintendent
reports
you
made
an
excellent
guard
he
seems
very
pleased
with
you
i
told
you
i
do
everything
i
could
to
make
good
hanlon
answered
but
now
he
made
his
voice
sound
very
aggrieved
what
the
big
idea
of
all
this
seems
like
a
mighty
funny
reception
after
i
tried
so
hard
why
that
light
in
my
eyes
and
those
thugs
ready
to
slug
me
if
i
bat
an
it
almost
like
you
do
trust
me
or
something
i
still
not
altogether
sure
we
do
the
leader
said
slowly
still
harping
on
that
hanlon
demanded
hotly
what
makes
you
think
i
not
on
the
up
and
up
i
worked
hard
on
that
stinking
hot
planet
i
got
out
more
anyone
else
ever
did
and
my
suggestion
about
nitrates
ah
yes
the
matter
of
the
uh
fertilizer
what
made
you
bring
that
up
the
minute
i
saw
those
greenies
i
guessed
they
were
animated
trees
when
i
saw
how
they
fed
themselves
by
sticking
their
fingers
in
the
hut
floor
i
figured
the
dirt
would
gradually
lose
whatever
nourishment
it
contained
same
as
a
farmer
fields
soon
lose
their
fertility
all
plants
i
know
about
extract
nitrogen
and
other
minerals
from
the
soil
so
i
figured
the
greenies
would
need
fertilizer
to
make
up
for
the
depleted
soil
in
their
huts
it
seemed
simple
to
me
ummm
you
were
right
apparently
it
was
a
great
contribution
to
our
work
and
we
are
grateful
he
looked
at
hanlon
a
long
moment
then
asked
sharply
how
did
rellos
die
a
dog
tore
out
his
throat
we
know
that
but
you
said
you
killed
him
who
suppose
sicced
the
dog
on
him
we
were
walking
down
the
street
and
i
kicked
the
dog
pup
to
death
when
she
charged
i
pushed
rellos
in
her
path
and
it
was
him
the
dog
killed
ah
good
very
unusual
most
uh
ingenious
the
leader
seemed
pleased
but
slowly
his
smile
died
and
he
frowned
again
all
this
makes
me
want
to
believe
you
hanlon
but
somehow
i
ca
seem
to
rid
myself
of
the
belief
that
you
still
are
connected
with
the
corps
oh
i
know
as
hanlon
started
to
protest
all
about
your
dismissal
and
disgrace
and
the
fight
you
had
with
some
of
your
former
classmates
a
few
days
later
incidentally
was
it
rather
straining
coincidence
that
it
was
an
admiral
who
came
along
just
in
time
to
save
you
you
see
all
that
could
easily
have
been
done
on
purpose
i
uh
not
that
simple
young
man
no
but
you
nuts
figuring
that
way
disgustedly
i
think
you
will
find
out
differently
the
tone
sent
shivers
through
the
young
ss
man
nerves
and
he
had
difficulty
controlling
the
impulse
to
wet
his
suddenly
dry
lips
i
may
be
wrong
i
hope
most
sincerely
that
i
am
but
i
have
so
far
been
able
to
bring
myself
to
feel
so
but
i
intend
to
know
for
sure
before
we
leave
this
room
panek
bring
in
our
other
uh
guest
hanlon
heard
the
gunman
leave
and
in
a
moment
return
he
appeared
in
hanlon
line
of
vision
pushing
before
him
a
manacled
man
at
sight
of
that
other
man
hanlon
had
to
gasp
chapter
oh
the
leader
said
triumphantly
as
he
saw
george
hanlon
start
of
surprise
i
see
you
recognize
our
guest
sure
i
know
him
hanlon
snapped
rigidly
forcing
himself
into
control
that
abrams
i
thought
i
killed
him
ah
now
did
you
so
again
the
leader
smiled
but
this
time
grimly
now
we
come
to
the
meat
of
the
matter
you
say
you
thought
you
killed
him
but
you
know
you
did
your
pretended
assassination
in
such
a
clever
manner
was
all
a
ruse
you
did
poison
him
at
all
you
merely
pretended
to
put
something
in
his
cup
that
a
lie
maybe
it
did
work
on
him
but
i
did
sorry
hanlon
the
trembling
abrams
whined
the
interruption
i
was
forced
to
tell
the
whole
story
to
his
highness
after
he
found
out
where
i
was
hiding
his
highness
so
this
was
the
fabulous
monster
of
whom
everyone
was
so
afraid
hanlon
heart
sank
to
his
knees
what
chance
did
he
have
now
he
would
never
get
out
of
this
alive
nor
get
his
report
to
the
corps
yes
hanlon
that
silky
voice
mimicked
meaningly
and
venomously
we
have
uh
ways
of
making
people
talk
this
abrams
like
a
fool
was
not
content
to
continue
working
as
my
secretary
he
had
to
get
foolish
notions
of
ethics
and
patriotism
and
try
to
uh
object
to
some
of
my
policies
why
did
you
let
him
think
you
were
still
a
corpsman
if
you
not
he
snapped
suddenly
hanlon
made
himself
stare
back
insolently
maybe
they
would
kill
him
no
be
honest
undoubtedly
they
would
but
by
the
shade
of
snyder
they
were
going
to
make
him
show
the
fear
he
felt
use
your
head
pal
i
had
to
make
an
impression
on
panek
so
introduce
me
to
someone
here
on
sime
who
show
me
how
to
make
some
fast
big
money
which
is
all
i
after
he
retorted
with
a
bravado
he
certainly
did
feel
but
which
he
hoped
would
make
them
think
he
did
when
i
found
panek
was
going
to
bump
off
abrams
i
horned
in
on
it
and
what
easier
way
to
make
abrams
play
ball
with
me
i
had
nothing
against
him
and
did
want
to
really
kill
him
than
to
let
him
think
i
was
still
a
corpsman
after
he
seen
me
when
i
was
still
a
cadet
i
know
he
turn
yellow
and
squeal
he
looked
contemptuously
at
abrams
then
turned
back
to
the
leader
and
made
his
voice
very
earnest
very
emphatic
but
i
told
you
the
truth
i
am
not
still
connected
with
that
rotten
outfit
and
wrong
if
you
think
i
am
do
lie
to
his
highness
panek
interjected
he
do
like
to
be
lied
to
he
do
like
it
aw
shut
up
and
keep
out
of
this
small
fry
hanlon
sneered
and
was
rewarded
with
a
hard
blow
on
the
side
of
his
head
that
made
him
wince
but
his
highness
intervened
that
will
do
panek
i
handle
this
now
hanlon
i
think
you
had
better
do
some
very
serious
thinking
you
can
see
why
we
are
still
skeptical
of
you
everything
points
against
you
uh
except
your
own
word
and
the
fact
that
you
so
apparently
did
work
hard
and
for
our
best
interests
at
the
mine
that
point
i
readily
grant
you
is
very
much
in
your
favor
i
am
being
very
patient
with
you
because
if
you
are
telling
the
truth
you
can
be
a
very
valuable
man
to
me
you
do
have
real
ability
and
other
assets
but
if
you
are
not
wholly
for
us
you
are
distinctly
in
our
way
i
tell
you
do
interrupt
please
i
might
inform
you
that
i
sent
you
to
the
other
planet
both
to
test
you
and
to
keep
you
out
of
the
way
while
we
investigated
further
and
i
could
reach
a
decision
you
were
not
supposed
to
come
back
yet
i
sent
philander
a
letter
to
that
effect
but
he
you
were
already
on
the
way
back
when
he
read
it
a
light
dawned
on
hanlon
as
memory
skipped
back
to
that
philander
had
merely
stuck
the
mail
in
his
pocket
when
it
was
given
him
and
evidently
started
reading
it
on
his
way
back
to
the
mine
that
explained
his
running
back
waving
a
letter
and
trying
to
attract
attention
just
at
that
small
part
of
his
mind
that
was
paying
attention
to
the
men
in
the
room
heard
his
highness
say
take
abrams
away
he
uh
is
of
no
further
use
to
us
and
wait
outside
until
i
call
all
of
you
when
they
had
gone
his
highness
leaned
forward
and
hanlon
knew
he
had
better
pay
strict
attention
and
keep
his
wits
about
him
for
any
opening
to
improve
his
perilous
position
i
speak
more
frankly
now
that
we
are
alone
hanlon
i
am
impressed
with
you
i
think
you
have
uh
tremendous
abilities
and
i
want
you
on
my
side
but
i
have
to
be
sure
i
would
advise
you
for
your
own
good
to
be
honest
and
frank
with
me
i
am
being
but
you
wo
believe
me
hanlon
said
earnestly
when
i
take
a
man
pay
sir
i
give
him
everything
i
got
you
gave
me
a
chance
at
the
kind
of
money
i
want
to
make
and
i
doing
everything
i
can
to
earn
both
the
money
and
your
trust
i
was
kicked
out
of
the
corps
and
i
do
i
can
to
get
even
as
i
said
before
we
have
uh
ways
of
making
you
tell
us
the
truth
the
leader
continued
as
though
hanlon
had
not
interrupted
but
you
would
not
be
any
good
either
to
us
or
the
corps
or
yourself
if
we
have
to
use
uh
persuasion
i
do
want
to
see
you
broken
you
may
remember
you
once
asked
me
if
i
could
it
out
let
me
assure
you
that
i
can
but
how
can
i
prove
anything
when
you
already
made
up
your
mind
not
to
believe
me
hanlon
asked
plaintively
i
doing
my
best
to
make
you
believe
i
admit
some
of
those
points
you
brought
up
could
look
fishy
if
viewed
from
one
standpoint
but
i
assure
you
you
putting
the
wrong
interpretation
on
them
if
you
look
at
them
from
my
viewpoint
you
see
they
are
just
as
true
his
highness
regarded
hanlon
silently
but
with
a
steady
concentration
for
some
minutes
that
might
be
true
i
had
about
begun
to
believe
you
when
we
found
abrams
and
when
we
questioned
him
he
uh
admitted
what
you
had
done
and
why
that
revived
my
doubts
are
you
willing
to
be
tested
under
a
truth
drug
hanlon
almost
gasped
in
dismay
but
stifled
it
he
knew
only
too
well
the
efficacy
of
modern
truth
drugs
they
would
reveal
every
thought
and
bit
of
knowledge
he
had
ever
had
all
about
the
corps
the
secret
service
and
everything
that
hurt
look
came
back
into
his
face
you
sure
are
asking
a
lot
sir
he
said
i
have
anything
to
conceal
from
you
but
no
man
likes
to
have
his
whole
mind
invaded
that
way
all
his
private
thoughts
and
feelings
i
do
see
why
you
need
suggest
such
a
thing
i
told
you
the
truth
on
matters
you
want
to
know
about
you
appear
to
have
done
so
and
i
honestly
want
to
believe
you
for
you
see
hanlon
i
want
you
with
me
you
my
kind
of
a
man
i
like
you
because
you
have
tremendous
drive
and
imagination
and
ability
yes
and
perhaps
a
bit
because
you
the
only
man
i
ever
met
who
was
uh
afraid
of
me
i
have
tremendous
plans
for
the
future
and
i
would
like
to
have
you
as
my
chief
aide
in
them
i
would
train
you
as
you
never
guessed
it
possible
for
a
man
to
be
trained
and
then
hanlon
we
could
rule
the
but
george
hanlon
was
only
even
to
that
last
that
shocking
that
totally
unexpected
proposition
his
real
goal
here
was
the
plot
he
had
been
seeking
the
plot
the
corps
needed
so
desperately
to
know
yet
his
personal
crisis
was
for
the
moment
more
important
if
he
was
ever
to
be
of
any
further
benefit
to
the
secret
service
or
the
corps
to
use
his
knowledge
something
else
must
come
first
his
mind
therefore
was
seeking
a
way
out
he
well
knew
that
once
the
truth
drug
was
administered
and
this
highness
would
not
now
be
satisfied
with
anything
less
he
was
as
good
as
dead
they
would
find
out
the
truth
in
minutes
and
then
would
have
no
other
recourse
but
to
kill
him
his
spirits
sank
to
nadir
with
the
knowledge
that
he
had
failed
failed
the
secret
service
and
the
corps
failed
his
father
failed
the
guddus
failed
himself
curiously
perhaps
at
that
moment
the
thought
of
failure
was
far
more
important
to
him
than
the
imminence
of
death
as
such
he
had
noticed
when
he
first
glanced
about
this
room
that
there
was
a
small
ventilator
near
the
ceiling
in
one
corner
desperately
he
pushed
his
mind
through
it
and
could
sense
that
it
opened
onto
a
place
probably
around
one
of
the
palaces
hanlon
finally
heard
his
highness
call
panek
you
and
the
others
bring
me
the
hypodermic
we
have
to
give
him
the
truth
serum
i
sorry
hanlon
he
addressed
himself
now
to
the
young
man
but
this
is
the
only
way
i
hope
we
wo
have
to
use
enough
to
harm
you
but
that
depends
on
your
if
you
will
tell
us
the
truth
quickly
and
willingly
i
can
as
i
said
uh
use
you
and
you
will
profit
greatly
by
it
hanlon
did
struggle
when
they
bound
him
firmly
in
the
chair
with
manacles
on
hands
and
feet
he
knew
it
would
be
useless
anyway
he
let
his
body
slump
into
his
chair
and
again
directed
his
mind
through
that
vent
he
must
not
let
them
defeat
him
he
had
to
survive
to
get
word
to
the
corps
then
his
searching
mind
contacted
another
a
weak
primitive
one
but
a
mind
avidly
he
fastened
onto
it
merged
with
it
and
found
himself
inside
the
brain
of
one
of
those
simonidean
pigeons
ah
this
is
wonderful
pigeons
seldom
fly
alone
where
you
find
one
you
almost
always
find
a
number
activating
the
bird
brain
he
sent
out
a
call
to
others
of
its
kind
that
it
had
found
food
in
abundance
soon
more
and
more
of
them
flew
down
to
where
the
now
enslaved
pigeon
was
standing
and
as
each
one
came
hanlon
sent
into
its
brain
all
of
his
mind
it
would
hold
inside
the
cellar
room
his
highness
rose
and
stepped
up
to
body
the
hypodermic
in
his
hand
remove
his
coat
and
roll
up
his
sleeve
he
directed
panek
and
the
small
part
of
hanlon
mind
still
remaining
in
his
body
felt
the
latter
doing
so
and
an
instant
later
the
prick
of
the
needle
slowly
at
first
then
with
increasing
swiftness
he
felt
his
remaining
mind
growing
numb
and
his
will
weaken
his
body
slumped
against
the
restraining
manacles
can
you
hear
me
george
hanlon
he
dimly
heard
his
highness
voice
yes
it
sounded
like
a
whisper
are
you
a
member
of
the
corps
i
i
he
struggled
not
to
answer
tell
me
i
i
and
then
in
a
last
desperate
effort
to
keep
from
telling
what
he
must
not
tell
george
hanlon
did
a
thing
he
had
never
dared
attempt
before
he
sent
all
the
remaining
parts
of
his
mind
into
the
last
of
the
pigeons
one
of
the
first
birds
he
had
already
sent
into
the
ventilator
so
he
could
look
through
it
into
the
room
below
he
got
it
there
just
in
time
to
hear
the
leader
gasp
of
dismay
as
he
saw
hanlon
body
slump
still
further
in
apparent
lifelessness
is
he
dead
boss
is
he
he
heard
panek
anxious
cry
his
highness
felt
the
pulse
in
hanlon
wrist
and
the
one
in
his
throat
no
he
still
alive
the
man
stood
there
in
deep
thought
his
forehead
creased
with
a
frown
of
concentration
there
something
peculiarly
wrong
here
the
leader
finally
said
aloud
something
very
wrong
and
very
strange
this
an
ordinary
fainting
spell
it
uh
beyond
my
previous
experience
he
straightened
and
addressed
hanlon
body
once
more
can
you
still
hear
me
george
hanlon
there
was
no
answer
no
slightest
indication
that
his
words
were
heard
he
reached
forward
and
lifted
the
body
into
a
more
upright
position
in
the
chair
answer
me
george
hanlon
do
you
hear
me
i
command
you
to
tell
me
are
you
a
corpsman
still
no
answer
no
twitch
of
muscle
no
movement
of
awareness
he
shook
the
body
a
little
and
raised
his
voice
still
more
i
demand
an
answer
george
hanlon
the
truth
drug
must
make
you
speak
but
only
silence
and
when
he
let
go
of
the
body
it
fell
backward
into
the
chair
and
the
head
lolled
forward
as
though
the
neck
was
broken
let
me
work
on
him
boss
panek
pleaded
let
me
give
him
a
going
over
let
me
barely
waiting
to
see
that
his
highness
did
not
forbid
it
the
thug
raised
a
short
ugly
piece
of
rubber
hose
and
struck
the
unresisting
body
again
and
again
across
the
face
over
the
top
and
back
of
the
head
vicious
blows
at
the
ribs
and
even
in
the
groin
but
he
might
as
well
have
been
pounding
a
sack
of
meal
the
body
sagged
beneath
the
blows
and
became
bloody
and
discolored
but
no
movement
no
conscious
movement
did
it
make
that
will
do
panek
his
highness
finally
commanded
that
does
no
good
this
i
can
not
understand
but
i
do
know
there
is
uh
something
most
peculiar
here
it
is
almost
as
though
he
paused
and
frowned
again
but
that
is
ridiculous
what
ridiculous
boss
what
is
it
is
almost
as
though
there
was
uh
no
mind
left
in
the
body
his
highness
said
slowly
then
abruptly
are
you
sure
that
was
in
that
hypodermic
you
fixed
it
yourself
boss
his
highness
wheeled
suddenly
rudely
awakened
from
his
thinking
by
the
loud
noise
one
of
the
guards
was
making
he
was
astonished
to
see
the
man
making
vain
motions
toward
a
pigeon
whose
head
was
sticking
through
the
ventilator
vanes
but
the
bird
did
leave
stop
it
the
leader
commanded
impatiently
we
more
import
he
checked
himself
and
turned
back
to
stare
wonderingly
at
the
bird
which
peered
back
at
him
with
apparently
unfrightened
beady
eyes
turning
its
head
to
first
one
side
and
then
the
other
as
though
better
to
see
all
that
was
going
on
that
peculiar
his
highness
said
thoughtfully
i
never
saw
a
bird
act
like
that
before
hmmm
i
wonder
but
no
that
absurd
he
turned
back
to
hanlon
body
as
though
disgusted
with
himself
for
entertaining
such
a
fantastic
notion
hands
behind
his
back
that
scowl
of
concentration
engraving
deep
lines
on
his
face
the
leader
paced
forth
and
back
across
the
floor
of
the
little
room
his
glance
ever
and
again
returning
to
stare
in
exasperation
at
that
body
who
was
this
amazing
young
man
what
sort
of
talents
and
abilities
did
he
possess
that
he
could
react
thus
to
a
had
he
been
so
treated
by
the
corps
experts
that
his
mind
would
be
blanked
out
in
such
emergencies
was
he
some
kind
of
a
mutant
with
powers
never
before
known
or
startling
thought
was
he
actually
a
human
being
at
all
better
than
anyone
else
his
highness
could
appreciate
the
fact
that
the
universe
contained
many
types
of
sentient
and
highly
mental
life
other
than
those
originating
on
terra
since
he
had
come
here
to
simonides
and
had
wormed
his
way
into
the
very
highest
position
beneath
its
emperor
a
weak
old
man
he
had
had
no
trouble
dominating
he
was
naturally
suspicious
of
anyone
who
might
be
attempting
to
discover
and
wreck
his
plans
such
a
one
he
was
now
convinced
was
this
young
hanlon
it
would
be
the
simplest
thing
to
kill
this
body
now
but
that
would
not
solve
this
baffling
problem
if
hanlon
perhaps
others
of
the
corps
had
similar
powers
no
one
with
such
abilities
must
not
be
killed
he
must
be
kept
and
studied
and
the
secret
learned
if
possible
but
his
thoughts
were
interrupted
by
panek
that
fool
bird
still
there
still
there
is
it
another
of
your
pets
boss
his
highness
wheeled
he
had
forgotten
the
bird
was
it
possible
that
hanlon
had
in
some
inexplicable
manner
transferred
on
the
surface
it
was
an
absurd
concept
but
there
were
magicians
on
his
home
planet
who
could
do
things
almost
as
unfathomable
he
suddenly
made
up
his
mind
kill
it
he
commanded
whatever
else
he
was
or
was
not
panek
was
fast
with
a
gun
the
words
were
hardly
spoken
when
he
had
drawn
and
fired
chapter
the
twentieth
part
of
hanlon
mind
activating
the
pigeon
in
the
ventilator
commanded
it
to
scramble
back
out
the
moment
he
sensed
what
that
command
would
be
but
it
was
quick
enough
he
felt
the
burning
sensation
along
the
bird
side
and
the
agony
it
suffered
the
wing
had
been
almost
severed
by
the
shot
and
its
life
was
swiftly
ebbing
he
had
to
get
out
of
that
body
and
quick
but
there
were
no
more
pigeons
around
except
the
other
nineteen
he
was
already
occupying
nor
did
any
of
them
have
brain
capacity
enough
to
contain
more
than
a
twentieth
of
his
mind
desperately
he
sent
the
rest
of
the
flock
swirling
into
the
air
seeking
other
nearby
there
were
no
other
pigeons
close
enough
to
hear
their
calls
nor
to
get
there
in
time
if
they
did
for
the
wounded
bird
was
dying
fast
nor
were
there
any
dogs
about
nor
cats
nor
animals
of
any
kind
to
be
seen
in
desperation
hanlon
even
tried
the
trees
or
plants
there
to
see
if
they
had
minds
like
the
guddus
but
none
of
them
did
he
dreaded
to
think
what
would
happen
if
the
brain
that
a
portion
of
his
mind
was
occupying
died
while
in
his
control
would
that
part
of
his
mind
then
be
lost
he
had
no
way
of
knowing
nor
was
he
anxious
to
chance
it
for
he
was
terribly
afraid
it
would
be
so
and
he
certainly
had
proved
he
had
no
mind
to
spare
he
thought
in
disgust
he
had
really
made
a
mess
of
this
mission
the
only
way
he
could
get
word
to
the
corps
was
through
his
body
and
if
he
sent
his
mind
back
into
that
now
he
was
a
deader
duck
than
he
seemed
to
be
for
even
that
twentieth
part
could
be
made
to
talk
did
those
pigeons
hurry
yet
he
knew
they
were
searching
frantically
this
was
the
weirdest
sensation
imaginable
people
had
often
expressed
the
wish
they
could
be
in
two
places
at
once
he
was
in
twenty
and
each
body
was
connected
with
the
others
by
a
thin
thread
of
consciousness
yet
was
thinking
and
acting
independently
his
composite
mind
almost
grinned
if
anyone
had
told
him
a
year
ago
such
a
thing
was
possible
he
would
have
called
for
the
and
rushed
that
person
to
the
nearest
the
other
parts
of
his
mind
were
flying
all
about
the
enclosed
park
that
was
a
part
of
the
great
palace
searching
desperately
seeking
some
other
form
of
life
that
could
be
used
as
a
housing
for
the
dying
part
of
hanlon
mind
suddenly
one
of
them
uttered
a
cry
that
drew
the
rest
to
it
on
swift
pinions
to
see
attached
to
one
of
the
trees
a
huge
swarm
of
simonidean
bees
will
the
queen
do
the
one
asked
anxiously
there
was
a
convulsive
shudder
in
all
the
minds
for
the
birds
knew
and
hanlon
had
heard
how
deadly
poisonous
these
native
bees
were
how
they
were
hunted
down
and
exterminated
when
found
they
were
twice
the
size
and
many
many
times
more
vicious
and
deadly
than
terran
bees
even
now
two
gardeners
were
running
toward
the
tree
with
a
great
metal
net
and
but
hanlon
was
desperate
she
will
have
to
do
the
aggregate
mind
decided
instantly
then
the
part
of
his
mind
in
the
dying
bird
detached
itself
and
entered
the
brain
of
the
queen
bee
there
were
long
disheartening
moments
of
twisting
and
struggling
to
fit
into
that
strange
vicious
insect
brain
he
finally
managed
to
take
control
yet
was
not
fully
en
rapport
sight
through
her
eyes
was
very
nearly
impossible
with
the
little
time
he
could
give
to
learning
their
texture
but
the
close
rapport
between
the
various
portions
of
his
mind
was
a
good
guide
the
queen
flew
swiftly
towards
that
ventilator
her
swarm
following
closely
at
her
command
into
and
through
the
vent
she
flew
and
almost
before
the
four
men
inside
were
aware
of
the
strange
buzzing
she
was
directing
her
swarm
towards
them
bees
panek
yelled
in
terror
and
the
four
started
fighting
the
hundreds
that
swarmed
all
over
each
of
them
that
may
have
been
their
mistake
had
panek
and
the
other
two
stood
perfectly
still
it
was
a
bare
possibility
they
might
have
survived
although
in
hanlon
grimly
determined
frame
of
mind
that
was
now
doubtful
not
that
hanlon
was
angry
even
at
panek
for
the
terrible
beating
of
his
unconscious
body
for
he
realized
it
was
the
man
cruel
sadistic
nature
that
he
could
not
have
acted
otherwise
but
hanlon
knew
now
that
the
peace
of
the
federation
demanded
that
he
live
and
be
free
to
make
his
report
and
only
the
death
of
his
highness
and
the
others
could
now
possibly
save
him
so
much
as
it
sickened
him
hanlon
had
to
keep
on
and
as
those
plunged
in
their
hundreds
into
the
four
the
poison
working
far
more
swiftly
than
does
the
venom
of
terrestrial
bees
more
akin
to
that
of
the
mamba
one
after
another
of
the
four
fell
to
the
floor
and
were
quiet
stung
to
death
hanlon
then
sent
the
queen
and
her
swarm
back
outside
after
first
impressing
on
her
mind
that
she
must
fly
far
away
if
she
was
to
survive
he
could
not
send
her
to
her
death
by
the
gardeners
after
she
had
saved
his
life
as
she
flew
away
he
recalled
his
mind
back
from
her
and
the
nineteen
birds
into
his
body
he
sat
erect
once
more
but
instantly
such
a
tide
of
pain
washed
over
him
that
he
nearly
fainted
for
all
the
agony
of
that
terrible
beating
hit
him
at
once
his
mind
too
was
sluggish
and
slow
once
it
was
back
in
his
own
brain
where
that
drug
had
taken
effect
but
he
felt
a
sense
of
satisfaction
and
gratitude
that
he
had
come
safely
thus
far
through
that
terrible
ordeal
the
drug
would
wear
off
the
wounds
would
heal
and
the
pain
would
disappear
in
time
meanwhile
he
was
alive
impossible
as
it
seemed
he
was
but
george
hanlon
had
enough
functioning
in
spite
of
the
to
realize
he
was
not
yet
out
of
the
pit
his
body
was
still
manacled
to
the
chair
that
in
turn
was
fastened
to
the
floor
so
he
could
not
move
it
he
was
still
inside
the
palace
of
the
conspirators
and
it
would
undoubtedly
not
be
too
long
before
someone
would
enter
the
room
seeking
his
highness
and
would
find
him
and
the
dead
men
for
desperate
minutes
hanlon
considered
every
angle
of
the
matter
and
found
only
one
possibility
that
might
offer
some
chance
of
release
and
safety
once
more
he
sent
a
portion
of
his
mind
out
through
the
ventilator
and
found
one
of
the
birds
still
nearby
again
he
took
possession
and
crowded
into
its
tiny
brain
all
of
his
mind
it
would
hold
then
the
bird
was
swiftly
winging
its
way
up
and
over
the
roofs
of
the
palace
into
the
dusky
sky
high
in
the
air
it
floated
on
pinions
while
he
surveyed
the
city
beneath
him
hunting
for
landmarks
he
quite
easily
located
the
downtown
section
because
its
lights
were
being
turned
on
now
that
evening
was
here
that
oriented
him
but
the
fact
that
it
was
so
late
brought
dismay
would
the
corps
officers
have
gone
home
and
if
so
how
could
he
locate
any
of
them
tonight
with
whom
he
could
possibly
communicate
he
had
not
thought
of
that
before
he
had
been
thinking
of
himself
as
a
man
not
as
a
bird
but
even
as
these
baffling
thoughts
and
questions
were
plaguing
him
he
was
flying
as
swiftly
as
the
bird
wings
would
carry
him
directly
towards
the
great
building
that
housed
the
corps
contingent
here
on
simonides
actually
it
was
only
minutes
until
the
bird
was
outside
the
great
structure
and
rapidly
looking
into
windows
lights
were
blazing
in
almost
every
room
and
hanlon
mind
knew
thankfulness
that
so
many
of
the
high
officers
were
still
at
work
window
after
window
the
bird
peered
through
in
furious
haste
searching
for
an
admiral
office
if
it
could
get
inside
hanlon
had
thought
of
several
ways
in
which
it
might
communicate
providing
the
admiral
was
not
an
orthodox
brass
hat
but
he
told
himself
to
maintain
courage
any
man
who
could
gain
as
high
a
position
as
any
of
the
various
types
of
admirals
would
have
had
to
show
his
resourcefulness
time
and
again
you
just
did
get
that
high
in
the
corps
otherwise
luck
and
persistence
achieved
his
ends
for
he
finally
located
the
offices
of
the
planetary
admiral
himself
and
that
officer
and
his
secretary
were
still
inside
at
work
hanlon
made
the
bird
land
on
the
window
sill
and
then
begin
tapping
with
its
beak
on
the
glass
time
and
again
it
did
this
until
the
two
inside
attracted
by
the
sound
looked
about
for
its
source
look
admiral
hawarden
it
a
pigeon
tapping
on
the
window
the
secretary
laughed
must
think
there
something
to
eat
in
here
the
officer
grinned
back
it
really
acts
as
though
it
was
trying
to
attract
our
attention
the
girl
commented
a
few
seconds
later
hmmm
i
wonder
the
admiral
spoke
half
aloud
then
as
the
bird
kept
up
its
purposeful
tapping
he
recognized
the
code
s
o
quickly
he
rose
went
to
the
window
opened
it
and
stepped
back
the
bird
showing
no
fear
of
the
humans
entered
and
flew
to
his
desk
the
secretary
had
also
risen
and
now
shrank
back
against
the
wall
her
hand
at
her
mouth
stifling
a
scream
it
magic
she
said
in
fright
no
bird
ever
acted
like
that
it
certainly
is
unusual
he
said
and
his
eyes
were
puzzled
i
make
it
out
the
bird
flew
toward
the
officer
and
with
fluttering
wings
poised
in
the
air
before
him
its
beady
bright
eyes
peering
directly
into
his
then
it
flew
toward
the
door
when
the
admiral
made
no
move
to
follow
the
bird
repeated
the
performance
it
seems
almost
as
though
it
wanted
me
to
go
somewhere
with
it
the
officer
said
in
a
dazed
manner
are
we
dreaming
this
thelma
i
i
do
know
sir
we
we
must
be
she
stammered
it
just
could
be
possible
otherwise
but
now
the
bird
apparently
noticed
something
else
in
the
room
for
it
flew
over
to
the
secretary
desk
and
alighted
on
it
it
hopped
up
to
her
that
was
too
much
the
girl
rushed
over
waving
her
hands
shoo
she
scolded
get
off
my
desk
you
crazy
creature
but
admiral
hawarden
was
no
fool
this
was
far
beyond
any
experience
he
had
ever
had
but
there
was
such
a
purposefulness
in
the
bird
actions
strange
and
unusual
though
they
were
that
he
felt
this
little
drama
should
be
played
out
without
interruption
leave
it
alone
he
commanded
sharply
in
a
tone
that
startled
her
so
different
was
it
from
his
usual
polite
manner
looking
at
him
in
astonishment
she
stepped
back
and
watched
with
him
this
unprecedented
action
with
its
foot
hanlon
made
the
bird
throw
the
little
switch
that
activated
the
writing
mechanism
and
then
with
its
beak
began
pecking
at
the
keys
luckily
there
was
paper
in
the
machine
a
letter
she
had
not
finished
the
admiral
stepped
up
to
where
he
could
see
but
waved
the
girl
back
when
she
started
to
follow
it
seemed
impossible
that
the
bird
could
write
anything
sensible
but
the
admiral
was
beginning
to
be
not
too
sure
of
that
his
eyes
opened
wide
with
surprise
as
he
saw
the
letters
appear
one
by
one
on
the
paper
a
n
d
r
m
a
no
longer
did
he
doubt
how
it
was
possible
the
future
might
tell
but
he
did
know
the
significance
and
the
urgency
of
that
message
he
ripped
the
paper
from
the
machine
and
pocketed
it
then
jumped
to
his
desk
and
flipped
the
intercom
switch
captain
jessup
a
company
of
marines
in
full
armor
and
all
weapons
at
the
main
gate
in
trucks
in
two
minutes
he
ran
to
a
cabinet
in
one
corner
of
the
room
and
threw
open
the
door
come
and
help
me
he
commanded
the
astonished
girl
dragging
his
own
space
armor
out
and
starting
to
climb
into
it
with
her
help
he
was
completely
encased
in
the
minute
and
was
strapping
on
his
weapons
you
can
go
home
now
he
told
her
he
turned
to
the
desk
where
the
bird
was
watching
with
its
beady
eyes
and
held
out
his
arm
curved
at
the
elbow
with
a
quick
swish
of
wings
the
pigeon
launched
itself
toward
the
suited
figure
and
rested
on
the
wrist
the
admiral
plunged
through
the
door
and
into
the
hall
where
his
private
elevator
waited
ground
he
yelled
and
the
bird
was
lifted
from
his
wrist
by
the
sudden
plunging
descent
but
fluttered
back
and
rode
that
wrist
as
the
admiral
dashed
out
of
the
elevator
through
the
halls
and
out
the
front
door
to
the
waiting
trucks
willing
hands
hauled
him
aboard
the
lead
truck
and
he
threw
the
pigeon
into
the
air
follow
that
bird
he
commanded
and
the
incredulous
driver
did
so
wondering
secretly
if
the
old
man
had
suddenly
gone
bats
when
he
saw
beyond
doubt
the
bird
destination
admiral
hawarden
gasped
but
he
was
too
old
a
campaigner
to
be
stopped
now
there
was
something
here
that
needed
himself
and
his
men
and
he
would
go
through
with
it
no
matter
where
it
led
he
knew
the
calibre
of
the
men
of
the
secret
service
and
while
he
could
not
know
how
it
was
possible
for
one
of
them
to
train
a
bird
in
such
a
manner
he
knew
his
job
was
to
back
up
whatever
that
individual
was
doing
as
the
trucks
skidded
to
a
halt
at
the
entrance
of
the
prime
ornate
palace
he
issued
swift
commands
his
men
disregarding
the
indignant
cries
of
the
palace
guards
who
swarmed
out
to
stop
this
unbelievable
invasion
of
their
rights
deployed
to
their
designated
positions
weapons
at
the
ready
to
the
officer
of
the
guard
who
tried
to
bar
his
way
the
admiral
snapped
i
apologize
later
now
get
out
of
my
way
then
with
a
squad
of
husky
marines
at
his
heels
he
followed
the
fluttering
pigeon
through
the
opened
door
along
a
hall
and
down
some
stairs
but
here
the
bird
seemed
at
a
loss
fluttering
from
door
to
door
seeking
that
certain
room
as
hanlon
had
so
shrewdly
guessed
admiral
hawarden
was
no
fool
but
quick
on
the
open
all
these
doors
his
voice
rang
out
commandingly
as
fast
as
doors
were
opened
whether
locked
or
not
made
no
difference
to
the
marines
the
pigeon
darted
forward
and
glanced
into
each
one
before
flying
on
the
next
then
it
disappeared
through
one
of
the
doorways
and
the
admiral
who
had
kept
as
close
to
it
as
possible
yelled
here
and
ran
into
the
room
his
men
streaming
after
him
welcome
to
out
cozy
nest
mister
a
voice
from
the
depths
of
a
big
chair
called
and
the
officer
ran
forward
to
where
he
could
see
you
certainly
made
time
and
am
i
happy
to
see
you
soldiers
get
me
out
of
these
things
and
hanlon
rattled
his
chains
at
the
admiral
gesture
the
marines
made
short
work
of
the
manacles
and
hanlon
stood
up
tottered
a
moment
and
would
have
fallen
but
for
the
quickly
extended
friendly
arm
of
the
admiral
he
was
still
groggy
even
though
the
serum
was
wearing
off
but
he
was
almost
in
complete
control
of
his
mind
we
got
here
in
time
then
anxiously
yes
thanks
to
my
little
friend
here
hanlon
took
the
bird
and
handed
it
to
one
of
the
marines
meanwhile
impressing
on
its
mind
that
it
was
safe
among
friends
look
after
her
and
withdrew
his
mind
she
gets
good
care
the
rest
of
her
life
the
admiral
ordered
the
wondering
marines
wait
outside
hawarden
looked
about
the
room
who
are
these
men
and
what
in
snyder
name
happened
to
them
they
were
stung
to
death
by
bees
hanlon
said
and
there
was
a
trace
of
vindictiveness
in
his
voice
one
of
the
prime
minister
the
others
his
gunmen
great
john
the
admiral
breathed
this
raise
a
stink
there
be
a
bigger
one
before
i
get
through
hanlon
was
grim
get
me
back
to
your
office
and
get
a
doctor
they
gave
me
truth
serum
and
it
has
all
worn
off
yet
and
i
hungry
he
added
so
plaintively
that
hawarden
accustomed
enough
to
sight
of
death
so
it
did
affect
him
too
much
laughed
what
we
do
with
the
bodies
guard
the
prime
minister
closely
merely
notify
the
people
here
where
to
find
the
others
hawarden
called
back
two
of
the
marines
bring
that
body
with
us
and
they
left
at
the
entrance
the
admiral
recalled
his
men
to
the
palace
officer
he
partially
explained
the
prime
minister
was
killed
and
we
taking
his
body
with
us
there
are
three
of
his
men
also
dead
in
room
down
there
i
notify
the
emperor
and
assume
full
responsibility
he
jumped
into
the
truck
front
seat
beside
hanlon
and
the
driver
back
to
base
chapter
the
doctor
notified
by
the
truck
was
waiting
in
the
admiral
office
to
give
hanlon
the
shots
of
antidote
and
attend
to
his
wounds
he
had
barely
finished
when
a
waiter
brought
food
these
two
gone
hawarden
felt
free
to
demand
of
hanlon
open
up
please
what
this
all
about
full
coverage
hanlon
asked
meaningly
the
admiral
flipped
a
couple
of
toggle
switches
on
his
desk
there
is
now
i
tell
you
the
story
in
a
bit
but
there
are
several
more
things
to
be
done
fast
he
described
the
location
of
the
hidden
spacefield
get
some
scouts
out
there
quick
but
if
the
freighter
not
ready
to
leave
have
keep
hidden
and
merely
watch
it
i
do
want
anything
done
until
just
before
it
important
we
arrest
of
its
crew
and
passengers
right
admiral
hawarden
turned
to
his
communicators
and
orders
rapped
out
you
have
to
tell
me
procedure
here
sir
for
i
do
know
how
to
get
what
i
need
i
want
to
recommend
that
the
entire
corps
fleet
rendezvous
near
here
immediately
so
we
can
go
to
a
planet
called
algon
and
take
it
over
but
first
we
have
to
find
out
exactly
where
in
space
algon
is
may
i
talk
with
your
planetographers
please
the
admiral
looked
at
him
quizzically
you
have
been
in
the
ss
very
long
have
you
hanlon
no
the
young
man
looked
up
in
surprise
this
is
my
first
assignment
why
do
you
ask
because
in
emergencies
such
as
this
you
give
orders
not
ask
for
permission
every
resource
of
the
entire
corps
is
yours
to
command
when
you
feel
it
necessary
why
why
i
did
realize
that
hanlon
shrank
back
in
astonishment
you
you
mean
they
let
a
pup
like
me
issue
commands
to
the
whole
corps
they
certainly
would
sir
i
do
know
if
you
realize
it
yet
or
not
but
no
one
gets
into
the
secret
service
unless
the
high
command
is
pretty
sure
they
are
exceedingly
individuals
so
whatever
you
want
just
yell
i
am
entirely
at
your
service
there
was
a
moment
of
incredulity
in
the
young
man
eyes
then
he
straightened
and
that
depth
of
character
which
the
men
in
command
had
foreseen
came
to
the
surface
and
he
issued
crisp
orders
very
well
sir
i
take
you
at
your
word
please
connect
me
with
the
planetographers
then
get
me
the
high
admiral
hawarden
activated
the
intercom
and
when
a
face
appeared
on
the
screen
ordered
give
this
young
man
any
information
he
wants
do
you
know
a
planet
named
or
hanlon
asked
about
twelve
and
a
quarter
light
years
distant
right
ascension
about
eighteen
hours
declination
around
plus
fifteen
degrees
here
a
rough
chart
of
what
i
could
see
from
there
he
held
up
to
his
screen
a
sheet
on
which
he
had
been
busily
marking
such
suns
and
nebulae
as
he
remembered
you
do
know
it
then
find
it
immediately
rush
it
through
i
must
have
its
closest
approximation
inside
of
two
hours
he
closed
that
switch
and
looked
up
as
admiral
hawarden
handed
him
a
microphone
grand
fleet
high
admiral
ferguson
is
awaiting
your
orders
sir
george
hanlon
young
hand
was
shaking
as
he
took
the
mike
but
his
voice
was
steady
and
crisp
admiral
ferguson
sir
this
is
george
hanlon
of
the
secret
service
i
was
detailed
to
the
simonidean
affair
i
just
returned
from
a
planet
i
know
both
as
and
as
the
planetographers
are
checking
now
for
its
exact
location
the
enemy
and
i
do
yet
know
entirely
who
they
are
although
the
prime
minister
of
simonides
was
one
of
the
top
men
if
not
the
actual
head
are
building
a
great
fleet
there
they
already
have
at
least
capital
ships
in
building
and
each
one
of
them
is
about
twice
the
size
of
our
largest
battleship
yes
that
right
twice
the
size
however
as
near
as
i
could
find
out
none
of
them
are
yet
far
enough
completed
to
fly
and
perhaps
not
even
to
fight
they
also
have
nearly
a
hundred
medium
and
light
cruisers
and
over
two
hundred
smaller
ships
scouts
destroyers
and
so
on
many
of
those
latter
two
classifications
are
fully
completed
and
at
least
partially
manned
that
fleet
must
be
captured
or
destroyed
before
they
can
get
it
finished
i
know
you
realize
that
better
than
i
sir
but
it
must
be
taken
care
of
immediately
oh
no
sir
you
ca
just
blast
the
planet
there
are
natives
there
that
are
high
enough
in
the
cultural
scale
so
the
planet
can
not
be
colonized
but
they
must
be
freed
from
the
slavery
under
which
they
are
now
held
they
are
fine
friendly
people
you
rendezvous
the
fleet
immediately
that
fine
sir
oh
one
more
thing
please
notify
ssm
regional
admiral
newton
to
send
all
available
ss
men
here
at
once
there
a
lot
of
cleaning
up
to
do
here
on
simonides
thank
you
sir
i
hope
i
was
in
time
with
this
information
hanlon
broke
the
connection
then
sank
back
into
his
chair
for
minutes
thinking
seriously
and
the
admiral
respected
his
silence
but
after
a
time
the
smell
of
that
delicious
food
made
hanlon
hunger
and
weakness
reassert
itself
feeling
he
had
done
all
he
could
at
the
moment
he
sat
up
again
pulled
his
chair
closer
to
the
desk
and
lifted
the
napkin
from
the
tray
i
talk
while
i
eat
if
you
pardon
the
discourtesy
sir
he
began
picking
up
knife
and
fork
and
as
he
ate
he
gave
hawarden
as
full
an
account
of
the
situation
as
he
could
except
for
references
to
his
mental
abilities
and
the
part
they
had
played
the
admiral
listened
attentively
and
when
hanlon
paused
at
what
seemed
the
end
of
his
narrative
the
officer
straightened
with
determination
then
the
thing
to
do
now
is
to
find
out
who
all
is
in
back
of
this
that
why
you
asked
for
all
available
ss
men
i
understand
that
but
about
his
highness
was
he
top
man
hanlon
knit
his
forehead
in
concentration
i
do
know
he
said
slowly
no
one
ever
spoke
of
anyone
as
his
superior
he
the
man
they
were
all
afraid
of
he
paused
a
moment
then
said
even
more
slowly
i
a
peculiar
hunch
i
wish
you
have
your
best
physicians
examine
that
body
have
use
and
fluoroscopes
rather
than
an
autopsy
i
not
entirely
convinced
he
was
a
human
being
what
there
was
incredulity
in
that
question
what
gives
you
that
idea
sorry
sir
i
ca
give
you
my
reasons
just
now
hanlon
face
flushed
and
his
eyes
were
appealing
it
is
that
i
do
trust
you
sir
but
there
one
secret
i
feel
should
be
told
now
maybe
later
and
if
i
do
tell
it
to
anyone
outside
of
ss
men
you
will
be
the
first
you
deserve
that
right
sir
i
did
mean
to
prowl
the
admiral
showed
no
resentment
much
to
hanlon
relief
your
orders
go
as
i
said
he
touched
a
stud
on
his
desk
and
when
the
doctor
face
appeared
on
the
screen
gave
the
necessary
orders
look
carefully
to
see
if
the
internal
arrangement
of
bones
and
organs
is
human
but
do
not
cut
without
specific
orders
what
about
the
emperor
sir
hanlon
asked
you
undoubtedly
formed
some
sort
of
opinion
about
him
he
was
a
wonderful
soldier
and
executive
as
a
young
and
as
a
man
hawarden
said
thoughtfully
and
hanlon
sensed
sadly
it
was
his
grandfather
who
pulled
the
original
coup
that
made
this
planet
into
an
empire
with
himself
as
first
emperor
his
son
the
second
emperor
was
also
a
very
good
and
solidified
the
empire
status
the
present
emperor
went
into
the
army
at
sixteen
and
rose
rapidly
through
sheer
merit
rather
than
because
his
father
was
emperor
all
historians
agree
on
that
just
before
he
reached
thirty
he
was
in
full
command
he
was
when
his
father
died
and
he
became
the
third
emperor
then
you
think
he
may
be
back
of
this
no
the
admiral
shook
his
head
somehow
i
ca
quite
feel
that
way
during
his
first
years
as
emperor
he
was
one
of
the
most
of
all
planetary
rulers
within
the
federation
what
about
his
prime
minister
and
by
the
way
what
was
his
name
i
never
heard
him
called
anything
but
highness
his
name
was
gorth
bohr
he
seems
to
have
appeared
from
nowhere
almost
overnight
as
an
important
personage
i
mean
we
traced
him
back
and
he
came
to
simonides
about
fourteen
years
ago
from
sirius
three
been
prime
minister
for
about
ten
years
and
it
has
been
noticeable
that
he
has
gained
more
and
more
power
during
the
past
few
years
as
the
emperor
has
been
failing
both
physically
and
mentally
i
wonder
yes
suppose
that
failing
health
and
mind
could
have
been
caused
instead
of
natural
the
admiral
was
plainly
taken
aback
what
caused
hanlon
nodded
just
that
from
what
little
i
know
of
his
highness
he
was
just
the
kind
to
do
a
thing
like
that
and
capable
of
it
too
he
sank
back
in
deep
thought
for
some
time
as
did
hawarden
they
were
interrupted
by
a
buzzer
from
the
desk
the
admiral
sat
up
quickly
and
switched
on
the
intercom
yes
bohr
certainly
was
not
a
human
being
the
doctor
reported
and
hanlon
could
see
the
surprise
and
wonder
on
his
face
in
the
screen
there
are
structural
differences
so
far
removed
from
ours
that
they
could
not
possibly
be
homo
sapiens
any
idea
where
he
came
from
hanlon
asked
and
the
admiral
relayed
the
question
never
saw
anything
like
it
before
and
i
just
made
a
quick
search
through
all
my
books
here
that
contain
pictures
and
diagrams
of
the
races
of
which
we
know
hanlon
shook
his
head
in
resignation
and
hawarden
after
thanking
the
doctor
and
giving
orders
for
the
disposition
of
the
prime
body
disconnected
is
it
too
late
to
get
an
audience
with
the
emperor
hanlon
sat
erect
the
admiral
glanced
at
his
wrist
chronom
pretty
late
but
i
see
he
had
just
reached
for
a
switch
when
his
call
buzzer
sounded
and
when
he
activated
the
screen
the
planetographer
reported
we
ca
find
any
such
system
on
our
charts
hanlon
spirit
sank
keep
looking
he
ordered
check
with
the
astronomers
it
somewhere
around
there
i
just
came
from
that
planet
the
sun
is
hot
looks
like
sol
from
inside
venus
orbit
although
i
do
think
it
as
large
as
sol
hawarden
then
put
through
his
call
to
the
imperial
palace
his
position
as
local
head
of
the
c
getting
him
fast
service
after
some
haggling
with
the
emperor
secretary
and
his
insistence
that
it
was
a
matter
of
the
utmost
importance
that
could
not
wait
until
morning
he
was
finally
told
his
majesty
would
see
him
got
it
hawarden
rose
come
along
hanlon
started
toward
the
door
then
looked
down
at
his
torn
and
dirty
clothing
i
not
very
presentable
we
can
get
you
a
uniform
from
the
barracks
hanlon
thought
swiftly
no
i
better
not
chance
it
although
i
sure
like
to
the
admiral
thought
a
moment
then
stepped
back
to
his
desk
and
pressed
a
stud
roberts
come
in
here
a
young
man
almost
exactly
hanlon
size
wearing
civilian
clothes
came
into
the
office
hawarden
grinned
those
do
the
ss
man
smiled
back
swell
strip
the
admiral
commanded
the
astonished
clerk
we
need
your
clothes
in
a
hurry
for
this
man
quick
as
the
young
man
hesitated
hanlon
was
already
removing
his
own
i
give
you
a
hundred
credits
for
them
roberts
but
this
is
prime
urgent
the
other
laughed
then
and
started
pulling
off
his
suit
as
fast
as
he
could
a
hundred
more
than
buy
me
a
new
one
it
a
good
bargain
the
exchange
was
quickly
made
hanlon
gave
the
clerk
his
money
then
he
and
the
admiral
hurried
to
the
palace
where
they
were
ushered
without
delay
toward
the
emperor
private
study
watch
me
fairly
closely
hanlon
whispered
as
they
were
walking
down
the
hall
if
i
shake
my
head
he
lying
admiral
hawarden
eyes
widened
and
though
he
said
nothing
he
was
thinking
this
is
certainly
the
most
amazing
young
man
i
ever
met
where
does
the
ss
get
they
had
barely
entered
the
study
when
a
door
on
the
far
side
of
the
room
opened
and
the
emperor
came
in
leaning
on
the
arm
of
an
aide
he
sat
down
heavily
behind
the
ornate
desk
well
well
well
he
barked
pettishly
what
all
this
about
sir
what
so
important
you
have
to
get
me
out
of
bed
i
am
most
sorry
to
have
put
your
majesty
to
such
inconvenience
admiral
hawarden
said
diplomatically
but
you
will
soon
see
that
this
is
indeed
most
urgent
it
is
also
very
secret
and
i
respectfully
request
we
be
permitted
to
speak
with
you
alone
the
emperor
waved
his
hand
impatiently
and
the
aide
retired
from
the
room
admiral
hawarden
set
a
small
box
on
the
desk
and
turned
on
a
switch
just
a
portable
spyray
block
he
apologized
i
know
i
know
came
the
exasperated
voice
get
on
with
it
man
tired
permit
me
to
introduce
george
hanlon
of
the
corps
we
have
first
a
bit
of
sad
news
to
give
your
majesty
and
then
some
questions
we
most
urgently
request
you
to
answer
as
fully
as
you
can
the
emperor
did
not
look
pleased
at
this
suggestion
that
he
be
questioned
but
said
nothing
your
prime
minister
gorth
bohr
was
killed
a
few
hours
ago
sire
what
the
emperor
sat
upright
his
face
showing
the
utmost
incredulity
but
hanlon
had
prepared
him
for
the
reaction
so
he
was
not
surprised
to
note
neither
dismay
nor
regret
for
the
monarch
suddenly
sank
back
into
his
chair
and
a
long
loud
suspiration
of
relief
came
from
him
he
closed
his
eyes
and
his
face
finally
relaxed
a
bit
suddenly
he
sat
bolt
upright
are
you
sure
he
barked
positive
the
admiral
assured
him
the
body
is
at
base
and
has
been
for
several
hours
how
did
he
die
he
was
stung
to
death
by
bees
sire
hanlon
answered
bees
incredulously
that
right
sire
he
and
three
of
his
men
were
attacked
by
a
swarm
of
bees
in
one
of
the
basement
rooms
of
his
palace
and
died
within
minutes
the
emperor
was
silent
for
moments
mind
roiling
then
he
shook
his
head
as
though
almost
not
daring
to
believe
this
news
it
may
sound
strange
hawarden
he
said
at
last
but
i
do
not
think
i
was
ever
as
glad
of
anything
in
my
life
as
i
am
of
this
he
was
an
evil
thing
though
i
did
not
even
begin
to
suspect
it
until
years
after
i
appointed
him
my
minister
by
the
time
i
felt
sure
it
was
too
late
he
had
gotten
some
sort
of
a
hold
over
me
i
no
longer
seemed
to
have
a
mind
or
will
of
my
own
any
more
the
admiral
risked
a
glance
at
hanlon
who
nodded
agreement
do
you
know
what
he
was
planning
your
majesty
planning
planning
you
mean
something
else
beyond
ruling
simonides
through
me
or
possibly
supplanting
me
entirely
i
afraid
he
was
sire
did
you
know
he
was
secretly
building
a
great
war
fleet
on
another
planet
there
was
an
pause
before
the
answer
was
barked
out
nonsense
sir
that
i
ca
believe
hanlon
shook
his
head
the
emperor
was
lying
now
why
was
he
part
perhaps
head
of
the
plot
his
had
not
yet
reached
an
answer
to
those
important
questions
they
would
have
to
question
him
skillfully
to
make
him
think
of
the
things
hanlon
so
desperately
needed
to
know
chapter
they
certainly
are
building
a
great
fleet
sire
on
a
planet
they
call
hanlon
stated
crisply
and
almost
gave
a
yell
of
glee
as
the
emperor
mind
fleetingly
called
up
a
picture
distorted
as
though
it
had
only
been
described
to
him
of
one
of
the
greenies
he
hurriedly
continued
punching
i
know
his
highness
was
the
guiding
mind
behind
that
for
i
was
supposed
to
be
working
for
him
and
i
just
come
back
from
four
months
there
the
emperor
started
to
deny
it
but
admiral
hawarden
stepped
closer
to
the
desk
and
fixed
the
monarch
with
a
stern
eye
we
do
wish
to
be
discourteous
or
insolent
sire
but
we
know
that
you
do
know
something
about
this
wait
please
he
held
up
his
hand
as
the
emperor
opened
his
mouth
so
apparently
about
to
demand
an
apology
for
the
of
calling
him
a
liar
we
do
not
believe
you
were
doing
this
of
your
own
accord
nor
that
you
initiated
the
conspiracy
but
we
do
feel
positive
you
know
something
about
it
and
for
the
peace
of
the
federation
we
must
have
every
possible
scrap
of
information
you
can
give
us
the
emperor
became
gradually
less
antagonistic
and
as
his
face
flushed
his
eyes
became
pleading
i
i
he
struggled
to
go
on
then
realizing
that
something
was
holding
him
back
changed
the
subject
slightly
i
hope
gentlemen
you
will
forgive
me
i
do
know
what
has
come
over
me
these
past
years
i
think
you
know
hawarden
that
i
was
always
heartily
in
favor
of
the
federation
and
did
all
i
could
to
make
it
a
force
for
peace
throughout
the
system
i
know
only
too
well
how
war
would
wreck
all
our
economies
and
i
do
not
want
that
but
i
seem
to
have
changed
these
last
years
and
i
did
want
to
it
was
almost
a
sob
the
admiral
as
man
to
man
went
quickly
around
the
desk
and
laid
his
hand
comfortingly
on
the
imperial
shoulder
we
all
felt
that
sire
you
were
far
too
great
a
ruler
to
have
changed
so
radically
it
puzzled
and
saddened
us
all
but
now
i
believe
we
can
begin
to
see
the
reason
and
it
does
harm
you
in
our
estimation
now
that
we
realize
you
help
it
the
emperor
raised
puzzled
eyes
what
do
you
mean
by
that
may
i
answer
that
sire
hanlon
stepped
forward
we
know
now
that
gorth
bohr
was
human
he
was
an
alien
from
an
alien
the
emperor
quavered
yes
sire
definitely
we
do
not
yet
know
where
he
came
from
originally
but
we
do
know
he
had
considerable
more
or
different
mental
powers
in
some
ways
than
most
humans
you
are
under
some
sort
of
a
compulsion
or
hypnosis
that
prevents
your
speaking
out
the
fact
that
your
health
failed
and
your
body
deteriorated
so
rapidly
proves
it
was
against
your
desires
the
emperor
was
startled
by
that
and
his
body
shook
as
with
a
palsy
he
repeated
his
query
dully
an
alien
hanlon
and
hawarden
nodded
silently
after
a
moment
hanlon
took
a
deep
breath
and
dared
the
question
may
we
have
permission
to
search
quarters
and
offices
to
see
what
evidence
we
can
find
that
will
perhaps
tell
us
more
about
his
projects
his
majesty
straightened
with
decision
and
years
seemed
to
drop
from
his
face
and
figure
you
certainly
may
i
give
orders
at
once
and
you
can
send
in
as
many
of
your
experts
as
you
desire
i
can
sense
the
need
for
speed
hanlon
bowed
his
thanks
and
the
admiral
voiced
his
that
is
very
gracious
sire
the
corps
thanks
you
the
emperor
was
gaining
strength
and
his
old
shrewdness
by
the
moment
what
about
that
fleet
you
say
is
being
built
on
on
some
other
planet
hanlon
noticed
that
hesitation
and
guessed
the
reason
but
for
the
moment
he
let
it
lie
and
answered
the
question
it
is
not
yet
a
serious
menace
sire
but
will
be
shortly
if
not
taken
into
the
hands
admiral
hawarden
explained
further
that
the
grand
fleet
was
being
assembled
and
would
cope
with
the
problem
within
days
good
good
call
on
us
for
whatever
assistance
we
can
give
they
talked
over
many
details
for
some
time
then
the
admiral
rose
as
though
to
take
his
leave
but
hanlon
was
yet
ready
he
wanted
to
pick
up
that
matter
he
had
let
lie
some
minutes
ago
he
stepped
up
to
the
desk
and
looked
straight
into
the
imperial
eyes
sire
please
think
hard
with
all
your
will
i
believe
you
know
more
about
bohr
plans
but
that
the
knowledge
was
hypnotically
sealed
in
your
bohr
had
that
power
we
know
please
try
to
break
that
seal
bohr
is
dead
now
his
can
no
longer
bind
you
the
emperor
seemed
doubtful
but
at
hanlon
continued
assured
insistence
finally
agreed
to
try
he
concentrated
for
long
long
agonizing
minutes
great
beads
of
sweat
stood
out
on
his
white
strained
face
and
his
hands
clenched
into
tight
balls
hanlon
almost
repented
and
thought
of
breaking
the
spell
and
telling
the
suffering
ruler
it
did
matter
that
much
that
they
could
get
the
knowledge
elsewhere
but
he
to
have
those
facts
and
if
he
could
suffer
as
he
had
done
so
could
others
but
just
then
the
emperor
suddenly
relaxed
his
features
became
more
composed
and
natural
and
he
smiled
in
relief
it
is
coming
now
he
wiped
his
face
with
his
silk
kerchief
bohr
did
boast
to
me
that
he
would
one
day
rule
the
galaxy
but
then
he
told
me
i
must
forget
what
he
said
and
i
did
that
speech
seemed
to
release
him
still
further
from
the
awful
tension
that
had
held
him
for
so
many
years
he
was
weary
but
happy
he
tell
me
much
in
detail
as
nearly
as
i
can
remember
merely
that
plans
were
being
made
to
gain
control
first
of
this
planet
then
the
federation
and
after
that
the
whole
galaxy
did
he
say
who
was
with
him
in
this
outrageous
undertaking
hawarden
gasped
and
hanlon
added
we
mean
was
he
alone
in
it
or
was
some
other
planet
or
system
backing
him
the
emperor
thought
steadily
for
some
time
then
shook
his
head
i
do
seem
to
remember
he
sighed
sadly
nor
could
he
after
half
an
hour
more
concentration
i
am
sorry
i
can
not
give
you
that
information
gentlemen
but
you
will
soon
we
trust
have
reason
to
believe
that
we
are
once
more
desirous
of
doing
everything
possible
for
the
peace
and
of
the
federation
there
were
tears
in
admiral
hawarden
eyes
and
he
impulsively
stepped
forward
and
grasped
the
emperor
hand
welcome
back
sire
he
said
sincerely
back
at
base
there
were
messages
awaiting
that
had
come
in
while
they
were
gone
the
admiral
handed
one
of
them
to
hanlon
it
was
terse
but
brought
a
happy
smile
to
his
face
coming
immediately
with
full
crew
congratulations
newton
others
were
from
grand
fleet
regarding
the
measures
being
taken
for
the
fleet
rendezvous
and
the
part
the
simonidean
sector
was
to
play
another
was
from
the
planetographers
giving
the
spatial
location
of
algon
with
the
note
that
they
had
finally
found
it
on
a
star
map
and
that
a
survey
ship
was
being
sent
there
at
once
hanlon
punched
a
stud
stay
away
from
algon
he
rapped
out
when
the
scientist
face
appeared
on
the
screen
do
send
that
ship
until
you
get
permission
just
forget
all
about
even
having
heard
of
algon
the
elder
looked
questioningly
at
the
youthful
civilian
giving
him
such
orders
i
do
know
hawarden
speaking
the
admiral
pushed
hanlon
aside
and
glared
into
the
screen
that
an
order
forget
it
as
you
were
told
yes
sir
it
forgotten
hanlon
turned
wearily
to
the
admiral
i
minus
on
sleep
and
strength
right
now
sir
think
i
go
get
some
rest
in
the
morning
i
come
back
and
we
start
searching
bohr
stuff
right
i
could
use
some
myself
a
couple
more
orders
then
i
going
home
do
you
want
to
bunk
here
at
base
no
guess
i
better
go
back
to
the
hotel
i
ca
appear
here
too
much
you
know
might
be
recognized
by
some
terran
officer
and
that
brings
up
a
problem
what
will
be
my
apparent
status
before
the
crews
doing
the
searching
civilian
specialist
called
in
by
the
corps
hawarden
was
used
to
quick
decisions
we
often
use
such
i
sign
a
pass
for
you
better
use
a
disguise
and
different
name
had
you
hanlon
nodded
false
mustache
skin
darkened
contact
lenses
to
color
my
eyes
and
i
call
myself
spencer
newton
hawarden
looked
surprised
you
pick
a
name
fast
the
ss
man
grinned
back
it
the
one
i
was
born
with
and
then
the
admiral
really
was
surprised
but
asked
no
questions
he
filled
in
the
pass
with
that
name
better
come
directly
into
this
private
office
when
they
met
in
the
morning
hawarden
complimented
hanlon
on
his
disguise
then
quickly
reported
he
had
already
assembled
crews
and
one
was
working
at
the
imperial
palace
and
the
other
at
the
minister
own
residence
good
hanlon
was
and
his
voice
was
crisp
i
think
start
at
bohr
place
the
two
officers
left
base
a
staff
car
rushing
them
to
the
ministerial
residence
they
entered
and
hawarden
led
the
way
down
a
hall
towards
bohr
private
office
but
just
as
they
reached
the
door
and
were
turning
to
go
in
hanlon
suddenly
pushed
the
admiral
past
it
then
jumped
across
the
opening
himself
hawarden
turned
in
puzzlement
but
hanlon
signalled
quiet
and
led
him
into
a
small
reception
room
adjoining
there
one
man
in
there
you
have
to
get
rid
of
before
i
can
go
in
he
explained
in
a
swift
whisper
young
junior
lieutenant
named
dick
trowbridge
he
recognize
me
even
in
this
disguise
how
he
ever
get
here
to
sime
trowbridge
oh
yes
he
was
sent
here
from
terra
when
we
asked
prime
for
a
umm
that
right
dick
was
a
hanlon
nodded
he
was
my
roommate
all
through
cadet
school
he
explained
it
would
give
the
whole
works
away
if
he
saw
me
here
he
our
only
good
decoder
admiral
hawarden
frowned
we
lost
our
best
man
we
have
to
use
him
if
any
code
shows
up
i
realize
that
but
send
him
away
for
now
if
we
get
code
we
can
send
it
to
him
at
base
right
sir
i
fake
an
excuse
some
five
minutes
later
hawarden
returned
all
clear
now
sir
they
started
out
then
hanlon
stopped
the
admiral
with
a
hand
on
his
arm
please
sir
his
face
was
flaming
his
eyes
miserable
but
his
voice
was
fairly
steady
please
do
call
me
all
the
time
it
may
be
that
my
position
as
an
ss
man
carries
that
distinction
but
it
makes
me
nervous
a
youngster
like
me
has
no
business
being
called
by
a
top
brass
like
you
who
has
worked
nearly
half
a
century
to
achieve
the
honor
admiral
hawarden
grinned
suddenly
and
hugged
hanlon
with
a
fatherly
gesture
you
all
right
son
and
i
for
you
from
now
on
simply
anything
to
make
you
hey
are
you
hanlon
nodded
his
son
the
admiral
eyes
glowed
wonderful
man
your
dad
one
of
the
greatest
the
young
man
swallowed
hard
i
think
so
too
they
had
been
working
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
sorting
through
the
voluminous
papers
in
the
minister
desk
and
files
when
another
corps
lieutenant
came
in
his
hand
bandaged
what
happened
to
you
patrick
hawarden
asked
in
surprise
that
blasted
toogan
bit
me
and
i
had
to
get
my
hand
dressed
what
toogan
one
that
must
have
been
bohr
pet
it
was
flying
all
about
the
room
yelling
and
cussing
us
out
i
was
crossing
to
the
corner
of
the
room
there
when
it
screamed
and
bulleted
over
slashing
my
hand
when
i
threw
it
up
to
protect
my
face
another
of
the
men
spoke
up
took
three
of
us
to
capture
it
and
i
wanted
to
wring
its
neck
but
captain
banister
would
let
me
so
we
stuffed
it
into
its
cage
and
sent
it
to
the
zoo
hanlon
was
intensely
interested
in
this
but
one
thing
puzzled
him
he
signalled
hawarden
to
one
side
and
asked
in
a
whisper
what
a
toogan
a
native
bird
here
much
like
your
terran
parrots
but
with
even
more
beautiful
plumage
and
they
can
talk
much
better
than
parrots
they
seem
to
have
quite
a
lot
of
intelligence
hanlon
was
instantly
alert
get
it
back
here
for
me
puzzled
but
unquestioning
the
admiral
went
to
the
visiphone
and
dialed
the
zoo
admiral
hawarden
curator
i
believe
the
prime
toogan
was
just
delivered
to
you
there
was
a
mistake
please
send
it
back
never
mind
sir
what
the
is
just
return
it
immediately
he
flipped
off
the
switch
impatiently
and
looked
at
the
young
secret
serviceman
with
wondering
eyes
a
toogan
what
on
earth
did
the
fellow
want
with
this
was
the
most
amazing
man
he
ever
seen
but
he
sure
did
get
results
he
turned
back
to
his
men
anything
yet
nothing
but
ordinary
state
papers
so
far
sir
was
the
consensus
keep
looking
remember
we
especially
want
any
mention
of
any
planets
whose
names
you
do
not
recognize
anything
about
or
about
mining
or
other
planets
hanlon
handed
hawarden
a
note
and
the
admiral
sent
a
couple
of
marines
off
on
a
run
half
an
hour
later
a
truck
pulled
up
in
front
and
the
marines
carried
in
another
desk
it
was
the
one
from
that
back
room
in
the
bacchus
tavern
hanlon
himself
went
through
this
but
was
quickly
disappointed
there
was
a
thing
he
wanted
in
any
of
the
drawers
he
turned
the
desk
upside
down
looking
for
secret
compartments
finding
none
he
ordered
the
marines
to
take
it
to
pieces
at
a
nod
from
the
admiral
they
dismantled
the
desk
but
it
was
perfectly
innocuous
hanlon
was
just
turning
away
disgustedly
when
a
man
came
from
the
zoo
with
the
caged
toogan
at
sight
of
the
familiar
room
the
bird
perked
up
hey
boss
it
called
out
in
a
clear
but
whistling
sort
of
voice
home
again
hanlon
had
no
trouble
understanding
its
words
spoken
in
simonidean
of
course
but
was
busy
examining
its
mind
he
walked
over
to
the
messenger
and
held
out
his
hand
i
take
the
bird
the
zoo
attendant
looked
at
him
doubtfully
it
a
vicious
thing
sir
he
said
be
careful
it
already
injured
one
man
they
say
no
one
but
the
prime
minister
can
handle
it
it
all
right
the
admiral
spoke
thank
you
for
bringing
it
that
will
be
all
hanlon
took
the
cage
and
giving
the
admiral
a
meaning
look
walked
out
of
the
room
with
it
chapter
in
the
next
room
george
hanlon
sank
into
a
comfortable
chair
then
opened
the
cage
door
and
the
toogan
fluttered
out
and
perched
on
the
chair
arm
the
young
man
fitted
his
mind
more
closely
to
the
brain
and
began
probing
carefully
he
studied
its
every
line
and
channel
utterly
oblivious
to
everything
else
his
first
brief
examination
brought
a
slight
sound
of
pleased
surprise
to
his
lips
this
bird
had
a
real
mind
far
better
than
any
he
had
previously
discovered
in
any
animal
or
bird
even
better
than
a
dog
and
he
could
read
everything
in
it
best
of
all
the
toogan
had
a
pictorial
type
of
mind
it
remembered
in
scenes
as
well
as
words
it
transmitted
an
almost
perfect
likeness
of
the
being
hanlon
had
first
known
as
the
leader
and
later
as
his
highness
gorth
bohr
any
slight
discrepancies
being
caused
by
the
difference
between
a
bird
ability
to
see
and
that
of
humans
like
a
swiftly
unreeling
film
hanlon
saw
the
minister
working
at
his
desk
walking
about
the
room
receiving
callers
playing
with
the
bird
eating
and
sharing
his
food
with
it
talking
to
it
confidentially
as
he
might
have
done
to
a
aide
for
over
an
hour
hanlon
sat
there
and
the
bird
seemingly
asleep
sat
on
the
chair
arm
without
making
a
move
finally
hanlon
rose
and
the
toogan
flew
onto
his
outheld
arm
much
as
a
falcon
might
ride
in
that
manner
they
returned
to
the
main
office
where
the
others
were
still
working
they
were
all
amazed
at
this
peculiar
situation
but
only
admiral
hawarden
came
even
close
to
guessing
what
was
going
on
the
memory
of
that
astounding
performance
of
the
pigeon
made
him
think
perhaps
this
surprising
young
man
had
actually
been
reading
the
bird
mind
or
something
equally
fantastic
hanlon
set
the
toogan
down
on
a
corner
of
the
big
desk
then
started
walking
toward
a
corner
closet
as
he
neared
it
the
bird
seemed
to
come
to
life
it
began
screaming
no
need
looking
there
there
nothing
in
there
nobody
ever
to
look
into
that
closet
sic
pet
it
dove
straight
at
hanlon
beak
open
and
screaming
in
rage
but
the
man
hand
and
mind
were
quicker
taking
possession
of
the
bird
mind
again
he
silenced
it
and
grabbed
it
by
the
neck
holding
it
gently
but
firmly
under
his
arm
open
that
closet
and
search
it
thoroughly
hawarden
snapped
several
of
the
corpsmen
jumped
forward
and
again
the
toogan
struggled
but
hanlon
was
holding
it
firmly
by
force
as
well
as
tightening
his
mental
control
which
the
powerful
compulsion
bohr
had
implanted
in
the
bird
mind
had
momentarily
broken
through
in
minutes
everything
was
out
of
the
closet
and
while
some
of
the
officers
were
examining
every
bit
of
the
contents
others
with
powerful
portable
were
going
over
the
walls
and
shelves
there
was
a
in
the
closet
and
one
of
them
started
to
mount
it
to
search
the
ceiling
but
the
moment
the
man
touched
the
stool
the
bird
mind
gave
hanlon
a
clear
picture
of
a
procedure
it
had
witnessed
many
times
he
gasped
and
called
out
to
the
corpsmen
that
stool
never
mind
looking
at
the
closet
itself
or
that
other
stuff
bring
the
stool
out
here
the
surprised
lieutenant
jumped
down
and
carried
the
little
ladder
over
to
where
hanlon
was
standing
with
the
bird
unscrew
the
left
rear
leg
about
the
middle
i
believe
the
officer
the
stool
and
after
a
moment
work
found
out
how
to
unscrew
the
leg
it
had
a
reverse
thread
in
a
few
more
instants
he
had
it
off
and
they
all
gasped
the
leg
was
hollow
and
in
it
were
a
number
of
sheets
of
very
thin
tough
paper
the
corpsman
started
to
unroll
the
papers
but
at
a
quick
signal
from
hanlon
admiral
hawarden
stepped
forward
i
take
those
lieutenant
i
think
for
the
time
being
at
least
we
need
search
no
further
since
most
of
the
papers
we
have
found
here
are
purely
planetary
matters
they
not
for
us
to
meddle
with
even
though
we
have
permission
to
do
so
back
to
base
if
these
are
not
what
we
want
we
can
start
again
later
as
the
men
filed
out
hawarden
activated
the
visiphone
and
got
the
minister
office
at
the
imperial
palace
find
anything
we
want
there
captain
he
asked
the
man
who
answered
not
yet
sir
report
back
to
base
then
i
think
we
got
it
here
he
disconnected
and
handed
the
papers
to
hanlon
who
had
in
the
meantime
returned
the
toogan
to
its
cage
and
now
sat
down
he
saw
the
young
man
face
fall
at
first
glance
at
those
dozens
of
rolled
sheets
what
wrong
it
in
code
came
the
explanation
reply
as
hanlon
swiftly
examined
each
page
in
code
or
in
bohr
native
language
whatever
that
may
be
ouch
if
it
that
we
sunk
better
get
trowbridge
on
it
anyway
had
we
yes
slowly
that
all
we
can
do
now
after
some
moments
guess
i
keep
out
of
sight
for
a
while
i
go
back
to
the
hotel
you
can
get
in
touch
with
me
there
i
still
sort
of
shaky
from
that
beating
i
got
and
need
a
lot
of
rest
want
the
doctor
to
look
you
over
again
no
i
do
think
i
need
that
now
he
said
to
have
the
dressings
renewed
in
two
days
so
i
see
him
tomorrow
right
newton
if
anything
comes
up
i
get
in
touch
oh
be
sure
and
let
me
know
about
that
freighter
you
had
no
word
yet
i
suppose
only
that
it
still
there
being
loaded
the
scouts
are
watching
it
closely
ready
to
blast
at
first
sign
of
departure
warn
them
that
we
want
of
the
crew
and
passengers
the
two
started
out
but
suddenly
admiral
hawarden
stopped
hanlon
with
his
hand
on
the
young
man
arm
about
that
business
with
the
toogan
i
not
prying
if
you
do
want
to
talk
but
should
i
warn
all
the
men
who
saw
it
to
keep
quiet
shades
of
snyder
yes
i
got
so
interested
i
forgot
all
about
others
seeing
me
with
it
yes
absolutely
it
must
never
be
talked
about
he
again
looked
pleadingly
at
the
admiral
i
i
sorry
sir
but
at
that
i
know
you
smart
enough
to
have
figured
out
most
of
it
all
right
highly
confidential
i
can
do
a
bit
of
and
especially
with
animals
and
birds
whose
minds
are
not
as
complex
as
human
i
can
even
control
to
some
extent
the
admiral
nodded
i
sort
of
figured
as
much
with
the
amazing
performance
of
that
pigeon
your
secret
is
safe
with
me
it
certainly
must
not
be
spread
around
but
i
do
mind
saying
i
glad
it
you
has
that
ability
not
me
with
a
laugh
it
is
a
load
hanlon
admitted
soberly
then
brightened
but
it
sure
saved
my
neck
when
bohr
had
me
prisoner
and
was
about
to
torture
me
the
admiral
looked
surprised
then
shivered
the
bees
i
connected
his
voice
died
away
and
after
another
brief
hesitation
he
left
while
hanlon
slowly
made
his
way
outside
took
a
and
was
driven
back
to
the
hotel
about
five
the
next
morning
hanlon
was
awakened
by
the
stealthy
sound
of
a
key
in
the
lock
of
his
hotel
room
door
his
hand
slid
swiftly
under
his
pillow
and
firmly
grasped
the
blaster
there
as
he
saw
the
door
open
and
a
figure
slip
inside
in
one
swift
movement
he
sat
up
and
switched
on
the
bed
light
up
with
those
hands
he
commanded
the
man
who
was
closing
the
door
carefully
his
back
still
towards
the
bed
the
hands
went
up
and
the
man
slowly
turned
dad
hanlon
yelled
in
relief
and
climbed
out
of
bed
how
did
you
get
here
so
soon
his
father
met
him
halfway
and
said
from
their
embrace
i
was
on
estrella
when
your
call
came
that
only
a
few
lights
from
here
and
they
sent
a
speedster
then
he
grinned
i
glad
to
see
learning
to
keep
your
eyes
open
even
in
your
sleep
hanlon
started
dressing
while
they
talked
in
swift
concise
sentences
he
told
his
father
all
that
had
occurred
to
him
since
he
started
his
job
nice
work
spence
his
father
applauded
when
he
had
finished
then
grinned
again
although
i
ought
to
spank
you
for
taking
such
risks
after
i
told
you
to
take
it
easy
at
first
i
was
a
bit
worried
when
you
disappeared
until
hooper
reported
what
you
were
after
but
about
your
job
he
continued
after
a
moment
we
had
no
idea
you
could
get
so
much
we
merely
hoped
you
might
find
a
lead
or
two
for
us
to
work
on
but
you
practically
wrapped
this
up
for
us
his
son
demurred
it
far
from
finished
we
got
to
get
to
algon
and
grab
those
ships
and
if
any
of
them
or
enough
of
them
are
in
shape
to
fight
that
may
take
some
doing
if
we
can
do
it
at
all
then
there
the
job
of
finding
out
where
bohr
came
from
and
how
much
of
a
menace
his
planet
or
system
or
whatever
it
is
will
be
sure
sure
i
realize
that
son
but
those
are
incidentals
given
us
the
and
we
needed
to
know
but
i
see
dressed
and
i
hungry
let
go
eat
as
they
were
breakfasting
his
father
asked
for
details
and
hanlon
explained
about
his
new
mental
powers
and
how
they
had
helped
him
i
ca
do
much
with
men
except
to
read
their
surface
thoughts
he
explained
but
with
animals
i
can
do
more
i
can
follow
those
surface
thoughts
and
memories
back
and
down
into
their
total
mind
and
can
take
over
and
control
them
but
it
wo
work
with
people
humans
seem
to
have
a
sort
of
natural
block
or
screen
i
ca
penetrate
newton
face
was
a
study
as
he
shook
his
head
to
think
my
boy
can
do
things
like
that
how
do
you
suppose
it
happens
i
can
dad
you
did
get
it
from
me
that
for
sure
his
father
grimaced
ruefully
perhaps
through
your
mother
from
her
father
he
was
a
peculiar
duck
they
used
to
call
him
psychic
for
he
get
some
of
the
craziest
hunches
for
lack
of
a
better
descriptive
word
he
often
seemed
to
know
a
lot
of
things
when
no
one
could
figure
out
how
he
could
have
learned
them
say
now
that
i
remember
back
he
used
to
have
quite
a
way
with
animals
too
although
i
doubt
if
he
had
anything
like
your
powers
you
said
i
probably
develop
other
mental
abilities
hanlon
grinned
nervously
but
i
certainly
never
imagined
anything
like
this
me
neither
ungrammatically
it
weird
they
had
nearly
finished
eating
when
their
waiter
brought
a
portable
visiphone
to
the
table
a
call
for
you
hanlon
and
he
plugged
the
set
into
a
hanlon
flipped
the
switch
and
saw
admiral
hawarden
face
smiling
from
the
screen
we
got
the
freighter
just
a
few
minutes
ago
he
reported
one
of
our
men
daringly
mingled
with
the
crew
as
they
were
boarding
and
jammed
the
airlock
so
it
could
be
closed
we
arrested
them
all
with
only
two
of
our
men
injured
and
five
of
the
enemy
bringing
them
into
base
now
fine
work
sir
admiral
newton
is
here
with
me
we
see
you
in
your
off
wait
sir
dad
says
you
better
come
here
to
the
hotel
room
they
were
barely
back
in
hanlon
room
when
admiral
hawarden
knocked
he
and
newton
were
old
friends
and
greeted
each
other
with
genuine
warmth
that
quite
a
boy
of
yours
newt
he
got
the
stuff
yeah
i
sort
of
proud
of
him
myself
he
really
done
a
job
especially
for
first
assignment
have
either
of
you
any
orders
for
me
concerning
the
mopping
up
hawarden
asked
but
looked
at
hanlon
ask
dad
but
his
father
interrupted
it
your
party
son
speak
up
right
now
you
not
a
youngster
just
out
of
school
you
are
the
corps
he
added
impressively
hanlon
flushed
but
there
was
a
sureness
in
his
voice
as
he
answered
that
only
the
bitter
experiences
through
which
he
had
so
recently
passed
and
which
had
matured
him
so
greatly
could
have
brought
we
got
to
liberate
algon
and
capture
those
new
battleships
as
quickly
as
possible
of
course
but
at
the
same
time
we
must
be
trying
to
find
out
what
planet
or
system
bohr
came
from
and
take
steps
to
see
they
ca
harm
us
that
means
we
got
to
exert
every
effort
to
get
every
single
person
who
was
working
with
or
for
bohr
and
especially
to
find
out
if
he
had
any
superiors
right
the
fleet
should
be
here
in
another
two
days
and
then
ferguson
will
want
to
blast
for
algon
the
other
matter
will
depend
on
so
many
things
we
do
know
yet
has
trowbridge
cracked
that
code
yet
he
reported
first
thing
this
morning
that
he
broke
it
late
last
night
i
assigned
several
men
to
help
him
and
they
should
have
it
transcribed
soon
hanlon
turned
to
his
father
your
men
here
yet
they
coming
in
as
fast
as
they
can
get
here
better
examine
those
men
from
the
freighter
and
have
your
gang
follow
up
all
leads
they
have
to
break
down
bohr
hypnosis
to
get
any
information
although
he
paused
and
his
face
grew
thoughtful
wondering
if
anyone
besides
bohr
really
knew
all
he
was
planning
beginning
to
believe
he
was
a
lone
wolf
admiral
hawarden
nodded
in
agreement
i
been
forced
to
the
same
belief
something
clicked
in
hanlon
mind
the
emperor
he
exclaimed
maybe
we
better
have
another
go
at
him
i
bet
his
mind
a
lot
freer
from
that
compulsion
now
and
perhaps
he
can
remember
more
of
what
bohr
sealed
away
from
his
conscious
memory
hawarden
nodded
that
a
good
bet
i
arrange
it
two
hours
later
the
emperor
was
free
to
receive
them
and
the
four
were
soon
closeted
in
his
study
it
a
strange
weird
feeling
gentlemen
he
said
when
they
had
explained
what
they
wanted
it
almost
like
trying
to
read
some
other
person
mind
i
felt
that
bohr
influence
was
receding
and
been
trying
to
see
what
more
i
could
find
he
sat
silent
for
a
moment
then
said
slowly
almost
in
a
voice
as
though
reading
from
a
printed
page
i
knew
he
was
building
some
ships
on
algon
but
i
did
not
know
they
were
warships
he
told
me
they
were
a
new
type
with
an
entirely
new
propulsive
principle
that
one
of
our
scientists
had
worked
out
there
always
that
possibility
of
course
newton
said
why
did
he
say
they
were
building
them
elsewhere
than
on
this
planet
hawarden
asked
the
emperor
frowned
in
concentration
then
a
peculiar
look
came
over
his
features
that
strange
he
marvelled
you
would
think
i
would
have
been
sure
to
ask
that
but
i
can
not
find
any
memory
of
ever
having
done
so
algon
had
most
of
the
natural
resources
for
the
building
of
ships
hanlon
ruminated
aloud
there
were
the
mines
the
forests
and
slave
labor
to
cut
down
expenses
it
was
mostly
engineers
scientists
and
special
technicians
who
were
there
overseeing
i
can
not
find
in
my
mind
the
names
of
any
others
who
might
have
been
in
the
conspiracy
with
bohr
the
emperor
answered
another
question
he
brought
only
one
man
to
see
me
with
the
request
that
i
present
him
a
decoration
it
was
the
scientist
who
devised
the
new
drive
he
said
a
professor
panek
i
believe
panek
hanlon
interrupted
a
man
yes
that
about
describes
him
but
panek
was
only
one
of
his
gunmen
the
young
ss
man
was
perplexed
he
did
have
brains
enough
to
invent
an
excuse
i
wonder
then
what
bohr
had
in
mind
to
bring
such
a
man
here
like
that
hawarden
frowned
maybe
a
trick
to
help
throw
his
majesty
off
guard
newton
suggested
or
else
just
a
sop
to
panek
vanity
to
tie
him
closer
to
bohr
hanlon
said
a
thing
like
that
would
have
tickled
panek
we
have
him
rounded
up
then
no
need
sire
hanlon
explained
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
were
torturing
me
and
was
killed
by
the
bees
the
emperor
looked
at
the
young
man
quizzically
and
a
knowing
smile
erased
much
of
the
tension
from
his
face
i
heard
about
that
incident
was
it
rather
peculiar
you
were
not
harmed
by
any
of
those
ferocious
bees
hanlon
face
was
as
bland
as
he
could
make
it
not
necessarily
sire
i
was
sitting
still
manacled
you
remember
they
were
moving
around
and
fighting
the
insects
the
emperor
winked
and
hanlon
probed
into
his
mind
receiving
the
distinct
impression
of
friendliness
while
the
surface
thoughts
were
saying
i
wo
pry
but
i
give
a
lot
to
know
what
really
did
happen
and
how
the
corps
thanks
your
majesty
admiral
hawarden
rose
to
leave
and
newton
and
hanlon
did
likewise
we
keep
you
closely
informed
of
things
as
they
break
and
the
three
backed
from
the
study
bowing
chapter
grand
fleet
had
been
rapidly
assembling
in
the
region
near
simonides
just
outside
visual
range
and
away
from
the
passenger
and
freight
lanes
mobilization
was
now
complete
admiral
newton
and
senior
lieutenant
hanlon
had
been
invited
to
ride
the
sirius
high
admiral
ferguson
flagship
and
were
glad
to
avail
themselves
of
that
privilege
they
wore
uniforms
conforming
to
their
rank
but
were
disguised
so
that
any
chance
acquaintances
could
not
recognize
them
although
there
were
no
other
terrans
aboard
orders
were
given
and
in
strict
formation
the
fleet
blasted
for
algon
first
went
the
great
screen
of
scouts
fanning
out
in
all
directions
from
a
common
center
the
outer
fringes
at
higher
speed
until
a
great
formation
was
secured
then
all
the
scouts
standardized
their
speed
when
they
reached
algon
they
would
completely
englobe
the
planet
just
beyond
detection
range
next
came
the
light
cruisers
in
the
same
formation
but
when
they
englobed
at
algon
they
would
go
inside
the
globe
of
scouts
nearer
the
planet
surface
then
the
heavy
cruisers
and
battleships
would
descend
in
three
mass
formations
one
directly
over
each
of
the
three
known
shipyards
if
any
of
the
ships
being
built
there
are
in
shape
to
attack
if
they
have
weapons
installed
and
crews
to
use
them
high
admiral
orders
had
been
very
explicit
you
have
to
burn
them
down
otherwise
we
want
those
ships
untouched
george
hanlon
was
thrilled
with
the
excitement
of
what
was
coming
yet
knew
a
touch
of
fear
he
had
never
been
under
fire
and
knew
only
from
hearsay
just
what
it
meant
to
be
in
a
ship
that
might
be
destroyed
any
instant
without
the
least
chance
of
anyone
escaping
in
space
warfare
there
usually
just
were
no
survivors
you
won
and
lived
or
you
lost
and
were
blasted
out
of
existence
but
it
would
be
long
now
the
scouts
were
already
establishing
their
globe
just
outside
of
detection
range
no
signs
of
being
discovered
yet
they
reported
then
the
light
cruisers
began
slipping
through
the
screen
of
scouts
to
take
their
positions
suddenly
a
number
of
great
beams
of
energy
stabbed
up
toward
them
from
below
and
the
screens
of
the
cruisers
flared
in
brilliant
confiscations
of
flame
as
those
mighty
rays
struck
them
do
you
cruisers
and
scouts
take
foolish
chances
high
admiral
ferguson
voice
rasped
into
the
mike
if
those
beams
are
too
hot
get
back
fast
heavy
cruisers
and
battleships
down
instantly
hanlon
could
feel
the
surge
of
acceleration
as
the
great
ship
he
was
riding
plummeted
planetward
in
the
plate
he
and
his
father
were
scanning
he
could
see
the
dots
of
blue
light
that
identified
the
nearest
scouts
and
a
moment
later
the
greens
of
the
light
cruisers
then
those
dots
fled
behind
his
range
of
vision
as
the
heavies
flashed
past
them
the
plate
hanlon
was
using
was
of
limited
vision
so
he
could
not
see
the
battle
as
a
whole
as
high
admiral
ferguson
could
in
his
screens
only
what
was
going
on
directly
below
and
close
to
either
side
was
visible
to
hanlon
yet
he
could
see
several
of
those
great
stabbing
beams
reaching
out
toward
the
fleet
a
change
in
color
at
one
edge
of
his
plate
caught
his
eye
and
he
saw
the
ship
nearest
on
his
right
begin
to
glow
as
a
heavy
beam
from
below
worked
on
its
screens
burrowing
its
way
in
and
in
trying
to
blast
the
ship
out
of
existence
great
streams
of
radiance
struck
and
ricocheted
from
its
screens
which
were
swiftly
mounting
through
the
spectrum
as
more
and
more
power
was
thrown
against
them
by
the
enemy
below
the
air
in
the
sirius
began
to
grow
hotter
and
his
father
answered
his
inquiring
look
they
attacking
us
too
and
that
heating
us
up
hope
our
screens
hold
he
grinned
grimly
you
said
it
a
shiver
of
fear
gripped
the
young
man
and
he
could
feel
himself
trembling
his
father
threw
a
comforting
arm
across
his
shoulders
first
battles
are
always
toughest
he
said
evenly
and
hanlon
calmed
instantly
he
turned
his
attention
to
the
screen
again
that
neighboring
ship
was
struggling
desperately
to
escape
knowing
she
could
not
stand
much
more
what
the
matter
with
that
pilot
hanlon
yelled
why
do
he
flip
her
over
and
beat
it
seems
to
be
held
by
something
his
father
anxious
voice
was
tense
have
those
others
got
some
sort
of
tractor
beam
tractors
hanlon
looked
up
in
surprise
i
read
about
them
but
thought
they
were
impossible
impossible
to
us
because
we
have
got
yet
newton
said
absently
they
are
theoretically
possible
every
beam
from
every
corps
ship
was
piercing
downward
suddenly
other
ships
were
appearing
and
the
young
man
realized
that
the
light
cruisers
were
coming
down
to
add
their
might
to
that
of
the
battleships
and
heavies
four
of
the
light
cruisers
maneuvered
swiftly
below
the
battleship
next
to
the
sirius
one
below
the
other
and
in
the
instant
of
their
alignment
the
big
ship
broke
free
while
the
others
flashed
away
from
that
restricting
holding
tractor
or
whatever
it
was
it
seemed
like
hours
that
hanlon
eyes
strained
trying
to
see
what
was
going
on
they
had
slowed
his
spaceman
sense
told
him
and
now
he
could
see
they
were
within
the
atmosphere
not
too
high
above
the
ground
now
he
could
make
out
huge
squat
mechanisms
from
which
those
deadly
rays
were
pouring
the
guddus
with
their
lack
of
knowledge
of
things
mechanical
had
not
reported
these
to
hanlon
else
he
could
have
warned
admiral
ferguson
about
them
and
the
attack
might
possibly
have
been
handled
differently
suddenly
a
speaker
blared
sector
two
is
in
our
hands
no
total
losses
a
number
of
the
enemy
scouts
got
away
they
far
faster
than
anything
we
got
a
yell
rose
from
every
throat
there
in
the
control
room
sector
two
hanlon
knew
was
the
spaceyard
where
the
scouts
and
light
cruisers
were
being
built
they
probably
had
armed
that
field
as
much
as
these
others
he
said
to
his
father
newton
nodded
then
the
two
walked
over
to
the
high
admiral
station
and
glanced
into
his
larger
bank
of
plates
now
hanlon
could
see
clearly
and
at
first
glance
knew
that
none
of
the
new
enemy
ships
below
them
were
fighting
only
those
ground
batteries
which
encircled
the
shipyard
he
could
see
that
most
of
these
were
now
out
of
action
destroyed
by
the
federation
ships
the
others
were
under
terrific
bombardment
not
only
from
the
ships
beams
but
from
their
bombs
and
guided
missiles
as
well
from
the
looks
of
the
destroyed
batteries
hanlon
guessed
the
explosive
bombs
had
been
followed
by
thermite
to
complete
their
destruction
we
lost
many
newton
asked
no
totals
ferguson
voice
was
gleeful
except
one
light
cruiser
we
must
have
caught
them
napping
if
they
ca
put
up
any
more
forces
it
all
be
over
in
a
couple
of
minutes
couple
of
minutes
hanlon
thought
was
a
gasp
he
glanced
at
his
chronom
and
was
amazed
he
had
been
sure
this
battle
had
lasted
for
hours
but
it
was
less
than
ten
minutes
it
did
seem
possible
but
he
quickly
remembered
what
he
had
learned
in
school
and
knowing
something
of
those
terrific
powers
unleashed
there
the
wonder
was
now
that
it
had
lasted
that
long
a
speaker
near
them
blared
admiral
houghton
reporting
sector
three
taken
two
of
our
cruisers
blasted
and
one
battleship
crippled
one
enemy
battleship
was
fighting
us
and
had
to
be
destroyed
really
got
something
sir
that
we
want
to
study
and
get
for
ourselves
another
yell
of
triumph
came
from
the
corpsmen
and
hanlon
felt
a
thrill
of
pride
in
the
service
of
which
he
was
a
part
then
a
moment
later
admiral
ferguson
called
into
his
mike
cease
fire
but
stand
by
on
careful
watch
and
send
your
specialists
down
in
gigs
i
meet
you
there
the
landing
successfully
completed
without
further
activity
from
the
enemy
ferguson
a
number
of
designated
newton
and
hanlon
some
technicians
and
a
company
of
marines
in
full
armor
disembarked
and
marched
to
the
safest
part
of
the
ruined
spaceyard
careful
examination
of
the
ships
there
was
ordered
the
who
swarmed
aboard
the
enemy
ships
soon
began
reporting
one
after
another
that
none
of
these
vessels
seemed
damaged
beyond
repair
thank
heavens
they
built
what
few
they
had
well
outside
the
field
ferguson
said
to
newton
and
hanlon
we
get
crews
in
here
at
once
and
complete
these
ships
george
hanlon
after
his
first
quick
looks
about
at
the
damage
done
had
been
sending
his
mind
out
and
out
trying
to
get
into
telepathic
communication
with
any
of
the
natives
but
had
not
had
any
success
had
they
all
been
killed
those
here
at
the
shipyard
probably
yes
he
had
to
admit
sadly
the
terrific
heat
would
have
burned
them
but
what
about
the
others
why
could
he
contact
them
excuse
me
sir
he
addressed
the
high
admiral
what
about
the
mines
and
factories
all
under
control
without
any
trouble
outside
of
a
few
individual
casualties
light
cruisers
and
scouts
took
care
of
those
while
the
main
battle
was
on
i
like
a
small
cruiser
to
take
me
to
the
mine
where
i
worked
he
said
and
one
was
ordered
to
come
down
and
place
itself
on
special
assignment
at
his
disposal
want
to
come
with
me
dad
he
asked
the
two
admirals
exchanged
glances
and
ferguson
nodded
go
ahead
if
you
want
to
we
wo
need
you
here
for
now
in
the
airlock
of
the
cruiser
hanlon
removed
the
disguising
makeup
and
it
was
as
his
self
dressed
in
civvies
he
had
brought
for
that
purpose
that
he
descended
at
the
familiar
little
spaceport
his
father
was
intensely
interested
in
that
fantastic
jungle
through
which
they
walked
to
the
mine
clearing
i
never
seen
anything
like
this
he
commented
in
amazement
are
these
trees
and
bushes
conscious
too
very
slightly
his
son
told
him
the
guddus
call
them
their
cousins
and
i
believe
can
communicate
to
some
extent
but
i
never
could
as
they
broke
from
the
jungle
fringe
they
saw
a
of
marines
on
guard
the
two
were
allowed
through
the
lines
and
entered
the
office
behind
his
desk
his
face
dead
white
from
suspense
sat
peter
philander
and
about
the
room
sprawled
the
engineers
guards
and
other
workers
hi
mr
philander
hanlon
called
cheerfully
and
at
sound
of
that
remembered
voice
the
superintendent
head
as
well
as
those
of
all
the
others
snapped
up
you
there
was
incredulity
in
the
super
voice
and
manner
yep
it
me
hanlon
grinned
i
glad
nothing
happened
to
any
of
you
philander
snorted
defeatedly
what
the
difference
between
being
killed
cleanly
in
a
fight
as
against
a
lifetime
in
prison
or
a
firing
squad
you
get
neither
one
hanlon
said
quietly
remembering
the
power
he
as
a
secret
service
operative
carried
there
be
a
trial
of
course
but
i
know
that
you
at
least
are
all
okay
he
boss
ai
he
one
of
the
guards
growled
truculently
why
should
he
get
off
free
iffen
th
rest
of
us
do
none
of
you
will
be
harmed
because
of
your
part
in
the
plot
his
highness
gorth
bohr
was
scheming
that
is
broken
and
we
know
you
were
all
just
his
tools
all
any
of
you
will
be
tried
for
are
your
actions
as
regards
the
greenies
if
brutality
against
them
is
proven
you
be
properly
punished
for
that
alone
he
turned
to
philander
are
the
natives
all
right
the
man
looked
up
hopelessly
unable
to
believe
hanlon
statement
about
himself
how
do
i
know
his
voice
was
dispirited
when
the
corps
captured
us
they
dragged
us
from
wherever
we
were
working
and
as
far
as
i
know
left
the
greenies
untended
they
probably
all
run
back
to
the
woods
hanlon
looked
at
his
father
i
going
out
to
look
i
have
a
feeling
and
he
walked
out
without
saying
more
nor
was
he
greatly
surprised
to
see
the
natives
all
sitting
or
standing
quietly
in
their
compounds
some
feeding
from
the
fertilizer
hanlon
was
glad
to
see
was
still
being
fed
them
others
merely
resting
waiting
the
gates
of
course
were
unlocked
and
wide
open
so
hanlon
walked
quickly
back
to
the
hut
his
crew
occupied
and
stepped
inside
the
doorway
while
waiting
for
his
eyes
to
adjust
to
the
dimness
he
saw
a
figure
launching
itself
at
him
but
as
he
quickly
stepped
back
outside
in
case
it
was
an
attack
he
saw
that
it
was
geck
you
came
back
you
came
back
the
native
was
babbling
telepathically
in
an
excess
of
joy
when
the
new
humans
came
and
took
the
old
humans
prisoners
me
said
it
was
your
work
me
knew
you
would
come
me
tell
other
guddu
to
wait
for
you
here
what
about
those
near
the
places
where
the
ships
were
being
built
hanlon
mind
asked
anxiously
i
tried
to
get
into
contact
with
them
but
could
many
of
they
were
killed
yet
most
ran
to
forests
when
great
fires
that
destroy
were
started
was
the
sad
response
hanlon
was
silent
a
moment
then
telepathed
again
there
is
no
need
for
you
all
to
stay
here
any
longer
tell
all
your
people
to
go
back
to
their
forests
for
they
are
all
free
geck
turned
to
the
other
natives
who
were
crowding
close
and
hanlon
could
see
him
talking
swiftly
with
that
little
mouth
soon
his
mind
was
suffused
with
a
tremendous
wave
of
joy
and
ecstasy
and
they
began
dashing
out
hanlon
could
see
them
talking
to
the
natives
in
all
the
huts
and
in
moments
all
the
natives
except
geck
were
streaming
happily
toward
the
nearby
forests
hanlon
turned
to
geck
i
like
to
have
you
stay
with
me
or
where
i
can
reach
you
for
a
while
as
soon
as
we
can
get
straightened
around
make
arrangements
to
do
anything
we
can
for
you
me
stay
with
friend
geck
said
simply
and
hanlon
was
glad
and
proud
of
that
friendship
with
this
strange
alien
they
walked
back
to
the
mine
office
and
there
hanlon
told
his
father
about
what
he
had
done
with
the
natives
admiral
newton
was
intensely
interested
and
frankly
studied
the
strange
weird
geck
it
was
his
first
sight
of
these
vegetable
creatures
animated
trees
hanlon
had
first
called
them
although
now
they
were
so
familiar
to
him
and
he
knew
them
so
well
that
he
thought
of
them
naturally
and
without
question
as
people
the
young
secret
serviceman
explained
to
the
elder
about
the
he
had
built
but
dismantled
before
leaving
algon
he
suggested
that
specialists
be
sent
here
to
see
what
could
be
done
about
teaching
the
natives
any
of
the
things
they
might
want
to
know
but
do
let
them
try
to
force
the
guddus
into
a
mechanical
civilization
he
pleaded
let
grow
in
their
own
way
and
make
what
progress
they
can
in
whatever
way
comes
natural
to
them
of
course
his
father
agreed
quickly
that
the
way
we
always
work
with
such
primitives
we
tell
them
and
show
them
what
we
have
but
only
give
them
what
they
specifically
ask
for
whether
we
think
it
is
what
they
to
have
or
not
do
worry
your
friends
will
be
in
good
hands
but
there
was
a
peculiar
light
in
his
eyes
i
sure
would
like
to
watch
an
autopsy
on
one
of
them
a
vegetable
brain
yes
it
would
be
interesting
hanlon
admitted
but
i
glad
you
treat
them
that
way
he
turned
back
to
geck
and
explained
telepathically
as
best
he
could
you
stay
here
with
we
the
guddu
asked
hopefully
i
sorry
but
i
have
other
work
to
do
and
then
as
he
saw
how
the
other
lost
heart
hanlon
hastened
to
add
i
have
to
go
help
other
enslaved
peoples
on
other
worlds
then
us
not
try
to
keep
you
but
us
hope
you
come
to
see
we
many
time
i
do
that
geck
my
friend
every
chance
i
get
chapter
we
got
a
problem
here
admiral
newton
said
as
they
followed
the
marines
who
were
taking
the
mine
operatives
to
the
cruiser
to
be
taken
back
to
simonides
for
their
trials
i
know
it
hanlon
said
thoughtfully
the
guddus
are
too
high
in
the
scale
for
the
planet
to
be
colonized
and
too
low
at
present
to
be
admitted
to
the
federation
as
true
members
yet
they
have
immense
wealth
and
resources
the
federation
can
use
and
something
will
have
to
be
done
to
protect
them
from
thieves
and
others
who
might
again
try
to
enslave
them
that
will
never
be
allowed
again
we
have
to
make
some
sort
of
a
treaty
with
them
probably
establish
a
small
base
here
and
perhaps
make
some
arrangements
to
mine
their
ores
if
we
have
anything
we
can
give
them
in
repayment
i
imagine
you
better
hold
yourself
in
readiness
to
head
the
commission
that
comes
to
handle
that
treaty
gee
thanks
for
that
dad
they
such
swell
people
when
you
get
to
know
them
ordinarily
they
live
like
of
nature
in
the
forests
without
need
of
homes
or
tools
or
anything
they
feed
from
the
elements
in
the
soil
so
there
no
food
problem
we
did
give
them
nitrates
here
but
that
was
because
they
had
exhausted
the
elements
in
the
dirt
floors
of
their
prison
huts
in
the
woods
that
wo
be
needed
oh
well
when
we
get
technies
here
with
transformers
we
can
find
out
what
to
do
with
them
i
going
back
to
the
fleet
now
the
elder
ss
man
said
i
suppose
you
want
to
go
back
to
simonides
to
handle
the
details
of
the
trials
of
these
men
incidentally
what
about
this
philander
did
you
say
his
name
was
why
do
you
think
he
need
punishment
hanlon
explained
rapidly
finishing
so
you
see
with
some
psychiatric
treatments
i
sure
that
inferiority
can
be
cleaned
up
and
then
be
a
real
asset
to
us
or
whoever
hires
him
a
sudden
gleam
came
into
his
eyes
say
if
we
make
that
treaty
with
the
guddus
he
be
just
the
man
to
take
charge
here
under
corps
direction
well
run
along
and
see
to
it
then
and
spence
did
i
remember
to
tell
you
how
proud
i
am
of
you
hanlon
hugged
his
father
thanks
dad
i
hope
you
always
will
be
i
suppose
the
cruiser
commander
will
let
me
ride
with
him
newton
smiled
fondly
not
you
son
you
merely
tell
him
going
to
go
along
admiral
ferguson
assigned
that
ship
to
you
on
special
duty
hanlon
smile
was
embarrassed
i
still
think
i
too
much
of
a
kid
for
so
much
responsibility
quit
looking
for
sympathy
it
was
an
affectionate
growl
okay
then
safe
flights
dad
see
you
on
sime
soon
yes
i
probably
be
there
a
day
or
so
after
you
safe
flights
once
the
cruiser
was
in
space
and
the
pressure
of
acceleration
abated
hanlon
sent
word
to
the
guards
to
bring
philander
to
his
cabin
when
they
had
done
so
he
excused
them
saying
he
would
be
responsible
for
the
safety
of
their
prisoner
sit
down
sir
hanlon
said
kindly
to
the
wondering
man
what
this
all
about
hanlon
philander
puzzled
who
are
you
anyway
i
was
assigned
to
find
out
what
it
was
centering
on
simonides
that
seemed
inimical
to
the
peace
of
the
federation
the
trail
led
me
to
algon
where
you
used
me
to
further
your
schemes
eh
the
tone
was
bitter
please
philander
do
misjudge
me
until
you
know
all
about
it
first
let
me
ask
you
did
you
know
who
highness
really
was
the
mining
engineer
shrugged
you
probably
know
already
so
why
ask
me
prime
minister
of
simonides
of
course
but
you
said
he
dead
now
did
you
also
know
he
was
human
that
he
was
an
alien
from
some
not
human
you
crazy
he
was
as
human
as
any
of
us
when
we
get
back
i
show
you
a
of
him
if
you
wish
he
was
planning
the
conquest
of
our
entire
federation
and
galaxy
the
corps
experts
are
still
working
to
find
out
just
what
the
details
of
his
scheme
were
but
that
much
we
do
know
did
you
know
about
all
the
warships
he
was
building
on
algon
ships
on
algon
the
surprises
were
coming
too
fast
for
philander
to
adjust
to
them
yes
did
you
think
your
mine
was
all
there
was
there
we
know
of
nine
mines
of
one
kind
or
another
a
number
of
factories
smelters
and
three
great
shipyards
incidentally
everything
is
now
in
the
hands
of
the
corps
philander
shook
his
head
in
stupefaction
i
not
calling
you
a
liar
sir
but
it
hard
to
believe
you
i
knew
there
were
several
mines
but
not
that
many
nor
about
the
rest
it
all
true
enough
and
i
still
to
you
my
good
friend
not
that
was
a
little
too
much
for
the
older
man
what
a
mess
i
made
of
my
life
he
groaned
hanlon
was
intensely
sorry
and
sympathetic
but
in
a
way
he
was
glad
to
see
this
present
mood
it
would
undoubtedly
make
easier
what
he
wanted
to
do
he
went
over
sat
on
the
arm
of
philander
chair
and
put
his
arm
about
the
other
shoulder
he
gently
touched
that
terrible
scar
when
and
how
did
you
get
this
philander
shrank
away
from
him
but
the
story
raced
across
the
surface
of
his
mind
and
hanlon
read
it
when
he
philander
was
about
eight
a
gang
of
boys
were
playing
about
an
old
building
and
somehow
knocked
out
the
prop
holding
up
its
remains
three
others
were
hurt
philander
got
that
and
his
brother
was
killed
and
you
felt
all
these
years
you
were
to
blame
for
his
death
hanlon
exclaimed
when
we
get
back
i
going
to
have
the
best
plastic
surgeon
remove
that
scar
so
it
will
no
longer
be
a
constant
reminder
then
a
top
psychiatrist
will
give
you
some
therapy
and
help
you
get
your
mind
at
rest
after
that
you
be
ready
to
take
your
place
in
society
as
a
very
valuable
citizen
you
forget
what
going
to
happen
to
me
because
of
my
part
in
this
plot
philander
was
still
bitter
and
unconvinced
nothing
going
to
happen
to
you
you
were
guilty
of
anything
except
having
been
hypnotized
by
an
alien
supermentality
hanlon
said
convincingly
i
see
to
that
myself
philander
looked
up
in
surprise
you
mean
you
a
young
fellow
like
you
can
tell
the
not
exactly
hanlon
interrupted
with
a
grin
but
this
was
my
assignment
and
my
recommendations
will
govern
the
main
thing
is
will
you
consent
to
the
plan
i
suggested
philander
sat
for
long
thoughtful
minutes
then
looked
up
piteously
if
you
only
can
do
it
when
the
cruiser
reached
simonides
and
hanlon
had
seen
the
other
mine
workers
safely
in
the
corps
prison
at
base
and
philander
installed
in
a
room
next
to
his
at
the
hotel
he
called
admiral
hawarden
congratulations
on
the
which
i
understand
was
one
hundred
point
oh
oh
oh
percent
the
officer
said
yes
the
other
end
under
control
how
about
bohr
notes
they
finished
last
night
we
got
a
complete
list
of
all
the
underlings
who
knew
any
of
the
main
parts
of
the
conspiracy
and
the
ss
agents
have
jugged
them
all
good
work
you
did
a
grand
job
sir
again
my
congratulations
thanks
admiral
hawarden
i
got
to
get
busy
now
on
my
report
to
the
council
call
on
me
for
any
help
i
can
give
i
offer
you
my
confidential
secretary
to
dictate
them
to
if
it
was
so
secret
thanks
she
would
be
a
big
help
but
we
better
not
how
you
know
it
was
a
even
a
pigeon
can
admire
a
shapely
shape
hanlon
quipped
as
he
disconnected
the
young
ss
man
was
just
finishing
his
report
the
next
day
when
admiral
newton
walked
into
his
hotel
room
gosh
dad
am
i
glad
to
see
you
this
time
his
son
enthused
i
need
you
to
check
this
report
let
see
what
you
got
newton
settled
down
in
a
big
chair
to
study
the
report
while
hanlon
fidgetted
about
the
room
anxiously
a
very
clear
concise
and
complete
report
spence
newton
applauded
when
he
finished
reading
where
do
i
send
it
and
to
whom
his
father
looked
at
him
quizzically
have
you
forgotten
about
the
special
mail
box
for
ss
men
the
younger
man
looked
astounded
you
mean
even
a
thing
like
this
merely
goes
in
there
newton
nodded
however
in
this
case
since
i
would
have
been
the
one
to
pick
it
up
i
take
it
to
base
and
transmit
it
to
the
council
incidentally
future
reports
should
be
marked
on
the
envelope
to
federated
council
a
couple
of
hours
later
admiral
hawarden
called
hanlon
at
the
hotel
where
he
had
just
finished
making
arrangements
for
philander
operation
and
treatments
your
father
and
i
want
you
to
come
to
base
at
once
sir
when
he
arrived
in
hawarden
private
office
the
admiral
handed
him
a
pair
of
silver
bars
these
are
yours
now
captain
hanlon
the
young
man
looked
up
in
surprise
you
were
told
promotions
were
swift
in
the
ss
for
those
who
produce
his
father
chuckled
the
council
was
very
gratified
with
your
report
and
ordered
the
promotion
hanlon
looked
at
the
two
insignia
and
his
fingers
stroked
them
almost
tenderly
you
miss
the
uniform
do
you
spence
sympathetically
hanlon
gulped
and
nodded
silently
very
close
to
tears
are
you
sorry
you
made
the
choice
you
did
to
give
all
that
up
a
long
poignant
moment
of
silence
then
hanlon
threw
back
his
head
in
a
gesture
of
pride
no
dad
i
honestly
glad
i
did
it
to
be
able
to
free
those
fine
guddus
from
slavery
and
to
save
the
federation
from
that
horrible
plot
it
was
well
worth
the
little
suffering
it
cost
me
but
and
his
smile
was
pathetic
i
do
miss
the
uniform
i
was
so
proud
wearing
it
a
moment
then
hawarden
spoke
here
are
the
transcripts
of
the
bohr
notes
and
soon
the
two
ss
men
were
deep
in
the
study
of
them
when
they
had
finished
some
time
later
they
agreed
it
was
a
very
comprehensive
plan
but
did
you
notice
hanlon
eyes
were
cloudy
he
does
say
a
thing
anywhere
about
the
part
his
planet
or
system
were
to
play
in
the
conquest
yes
i
noticed
that
it
was
a
duet
from
the
two
others
and
newton
added
for
all
there
is
here
you
almost
feel
sure
he
was
playing
a
lone
hand
if
that
true
hawarden
said
thankfully
none
of
the
other
men
picked
up
matter
we
might
as
well
let
them
go
i
say
so
newton
agreed
if
we
can
prove
bohr
was
in
this
for
himself
and
was
controlling
them
from
what
i
saw
of
him
hanlon
said
seriously
after
a
long
moment
of
thought
i
say
he
was
capable
of
trying
it
he
certainly
had
will
to
power
and
he
was
no
dummy
he
had
a
really
powerful
mind
but
he
was
cold
beneath
that
suave
exterior
he
was
utterly
without
compassion
mercy
or
any
feeling
of
justice
he
would
care
who
or
what
was
damaged
as
long
as
he
could
get
what
he
wanted
i
doubt
if
there
was
anyone
he
could
really
call
a
friend
or
to
whom
he
could
talk
in
full
confidence
except
possibly
that
bird
you
told
his
father
began
absently
when
hanlon
interrupted
with
a
whoop
hey
that
it
he
jumped
up
and
ran
to
the
visiphone
and
dialed
the
zoo
bring
that
toogan
of
bohr
back
to
base
what
again
the
indignant
curator
asked
i
sorry
sir
but
this
is
probably
the
last
time
we
need
it
please
get
it
here
immediately
what
the
excitement
newton
asked
curiously
your
remark
reminded
me
of
something
i
noticed
only
dimly
in
its
mind
and
did
pursue
at
the
time
while
they
were
waiting
for
the
bird
hanlon
asked
what
about
the
new
ships
have
the
experts
got
figured
out
yet
not
entirely
the
hulls
are
about
the
same
as
the
snyder
ships
only
larger
but
that
new
power
system
is
so
radically
different
going
rapidly
nuts
trying
to
understand
it
and
they
do
have
no
sooner
had
the
messenger
left
after
delivering
the
toogan
than
hanlon
had
it
out
of
the
cage
and
perched
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
then
for
nearly
an
hour
he
sat
there
deaf
dumb
and
blind
to
all
else
while
he
explored
every
nook
and
cranny
of
that
avian
mind
got
it
he
yelled
at
last
and
the
bird
freed
from
control
sprang
into
the
air
and
flew
wildly
about
seeking
escape
what
did
you
learn
the
admirals
were
as
excited
as
he
we
nothing
to
fear
bohr
was
entirely
on
his
own
the
people
of
his
planetary
system
canopus
are
so
far
advanced
they
live
on
a
completely
basis
every
one
instinctively
working
for
the
common
good
of
all
bohr
was
an
atavism
they
caught
him
trying
to
there
and
banished
him
he
came
here
for
his
restless
mind
and
savage
urge
to
dominate
others
would
not
let
him
rest
until
he
was
absolute
ruler
of
some
world
or
system
the
bigger
the
better
from
his
viewpoint
and
you
got
all
that
from
a
bird
incredulously
yes
you
were
right
when
you
said
bohr
did
have
a
friend
except
the
toogan
i
think
that
why
he
sort
of
liked
me
perhaps
he
felt
i
would
be
one
all
men
have
the
need
to
talk
to
someone
some
times
so
bohr
chose
this
toogan
who
is
really
quite
intelligent
and
who
could
talk
back
with
him
the
bird
does
it
all
of
course
but
all
engraved
on
his
brain
that
means
then
newton
said
thankfully
that
we
wo
have
to
worry
about
a
war
with
another
system
or
galaxy
yes
and
that
a
real
help
hawarden
added
even
one
man
or
entity
like
bohr
could
have
given
us
a
bad
enough
time
and
perhaps
even
wrecked
the
federation
well
i
guess
that
winds
it
up
except
for
a
lot
of
detail
work
newton
rose
i
got
to
get
back
to
my
own
job
on
estrella
hawarden
call
the
port
and
have
them
ready
my
ship
please
and
it
been
good
seeing
you
again
thanks
for
everything
safe
flights
newton
and
the
admiral
started
calling
the
spaceport
you
get
your
orders
in
a
day
or
two
about
going
back
to
algon
with
the
commission
newton
told
hanlon
might
as
well
stay
here
until
then
after
affectionate
farewells
he
started
out
then
stopped
bursting
into
a
laugh
what
the
gag
dad
it
just
came
to
me
that
this
was
once
where
the
son
told
the
father
all
about
birds
and
the
bees
well
hanlon
quipped
but
kept
his
face
straight
i
figured
you
were
old
enough
now
to
know
the
end
