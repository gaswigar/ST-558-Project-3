albert
savarus
one
of
the
few
where
under
the
restoration
the
archbishop
of
besancon
was
sometimes
to
be
seen
was
that
of
the
baronne
de
watteville
to
whom
he
was
particularly
attached
on
account
of
her
religious
sentiments
a
word
as
to
this
lady
the
most
important
lady
of
besancon
monsieur
de
watteville
a
descendant
of
the
famous
watteville
the
most
successful
and
illustrious
of
murderers
and
renegades
his
extraordinary
adventures
are
too
much
a
part
of
history
to
be
related
here
this
nineteenth
century
monsieur
de
watteville
was
as
gentle
and
peaceable
as
his
ancestor
of
the
had
been
passionate
and
turbulent
after
living
in
the
la
franche
comte
like
a
in
the
crack
of
a
wainscot
he
had
married
the
heiress
of
the
celebrated
house
of
rupt
mademoiselle
de
rupt
brought
twenty
thousand
francs
a
year
in
the
funds
to
add
to
the
ten
thousand
francs
a
year
in
real
estate
of
the
baron
de
watteville
the
swiss
gentleman
s
the
wattevilles
are
swiss
was
then
borne
as
an
escutcheon
of
pretence
on
the
old
shield
of
the
rupts
the
marriage
arranged
in
was
solemnized
in
after
the
second
restoration
within
three
years
of
the
birth
of
a
daughter
all
madame
de
watteville
s
grandparents
were
dead
and
their
estates
wound
up
monsieur
de
watteville
s
house
was
then
sold
and
they
settled
in
the
rue
de
la
prefecture
in
the
fine
old
mansion
of
the
rupts
with
an
immense
garden
stretching
to
the
rue
du
perron
madame
de
watteville
devout
as
a
girl
became
even
more
so
after
her
marriage
she
is
one
of
the
queens
of
the
saintly
brotherhood
which
gives
the
upper
circles
of
besancon
a
solemn
air
and
prudish
manners
in
harmony
with
the
character
of
the
town
monsieur
le
baron
de
watteville
a
dry
lean
man
devoid
of
intelligence
looked
worn
out
without
any
one
knowing
whereby
for
he
enjoyed
the
profoundest
ignorance
but
as
his
wife
was
a
woman
and
of
a
stern
nature
that
became
proverbial
we
still
say
as
sharp
as
madame
de
watteville
some
wits
of
the
legal
profession
declared
that
he
had
been
worn
against
that
rock
is
obviously
derived
from
scientific
students
of
social
phenomena
will
not
fail
to
have
observed
that
rosalie
was
the
only
offspring
of
the
union
between
the
wattevilles
and
the
rupts
monsieur
de
watteville
spent
his
existence
in
a
handsome
workshop
with
a
lathe
he
was
a
turner
as
subsidiary
to
this
pursuit
he
took
up
a
fancy
for
making
collections
philosophical
doctors
devoted
to
the
study
of
madness
regard
this
tendency
towards
collecting
as
a
first
degree
of
mental
aberration
when
it
is
set
on
small
things
the
baron
de
watteville
treasured
shells
and
geological
fragments
of
the
neighborhood
of
besancon
some
contradictory
folk
especially
women
would
say
of
monsieur
de
watteville
he
has
a
noble
soul
he
perceived
from
the
first
days
of
his
married
life
that
he
would
never
be
his
wife
s
master
so
he
threw
himself
into
a
mechanical
occupation
and
good
the
house
of
the
rupts
was
not
devoid
of
a
certain
magnificence
worthy
of
louis
and
bore
traces
of
the
nobility
of
the
two
families
who
had
mingled
in
the
chandeliers
of
glass
cut
in
the
shape
of
leaves
the
brocades
the
damask
the
carpets
the
gilt
furniture
were
all
in
harmony
with
the
old
liveries
and
the
old
servants
though
served
in
blackened
family
plate
round
a
tray
furnished
with
dresden
china
the
food
was
exquisite
the
wines
selected
by
monsieur
de
watteville
who
to
occupy
his
time
and
vary
his
employments
was
his
own
butler
enjoyed
a
sort
of
fame
throughout
the
department
madame
de
watteville
s
fortune
was
a
fine
one
while
her
husband
s
which
consisted
only
of
the
estate
of
rouxey
worth
about
ten
thousand
francs
a
year
was
not
increased
by
inheritance
it
is
needless
to
add
that
in
consequence
of
madame
de
watteville
s
close
intimacy
with
the
archbishop
the
three
or
four
clever
or
remarkable
abbes
of
the
diocese
who
were
not
averse
to
good
feeding
were
very
much
at
home
at
her
house
at
a
ceremonial
dinner
given
in
honor
of
i
know
not
whose
wedding
at
the
beginning
of
september
when
the
women
were
standing
in
a
circle
round
the
fire
and
the
men
in
groups
by
the
windows
every
one
exclaimed
with
pleasure
at
the
entrance
of
monsieur
l
abbe
de
grancey
who
was
announced
well
and
the
lawsuit
they
all
cried
won
replied
the
the
verdict
of
the
court
from
which
we
had
no
hope
you
know
why
this
was
an
allusion
to
the
members
of
the
first
court
of
appeal
of
the
legitimists
had
almost
all
withdrawn
the
verdict
is
in
our
favor
on
every
point
and
reverses
the
decision
of
the
lower
everybody
thought
you
were
done
and
we
should
have
been
but
for
me
i
told
our
advocate
to
be
off
to
paris
and
at
the
crucial
moment
i
was
able
to
secure
a
new
pleader
to
whom
we
owe
our
victory
a
wonderful
man
at
besancon
said
monsieur
de
watteville
guilelessly
at
besancon
replied
the
abbe
de
grancey
oh
yes
savaron
said
a
handsome
young
man
sitting
near
the
baroness
and
named
de
soulas
he
spent
five
or
six
nights
over
it
he
devoured
documents
and
briefs
he
had
seven
or
eight
interviews
of
several
hours
with
me
continued
monsieur
de
grancey
who
had
just
reappeared
at
the
hotel
de
rupt
for
the
first
time
in
three
weeks
in
short
monsieur
savaron
has
just
completely
beaten
the
celebrated
lawyer
whom
our
adversaries
had
sent
for
from
paris
this
young
man
is
wonderful
the
bigwigs
say
thus
the
chapter
is
twice
victorious
it
has
triumphed
in
law
and
also
in
politics
since
it
has
vanquished
liberalism
in
the
person
of
the
counsel
of
our
our
adversaries
so
our
advocate
said
must
not
expect
to
find
readiness
on
all
sides
to
ruin
the
the
president
was
obliged
to
enforce
silence
all
the
townsfolk
of
besancon
applauded
thus
the
possession
of
the
buildings
of
the
old
convent
remains
with
the
chapter
of
the
cathedral
of
besancon
monsieur
savaron
however
invited
his
parisian
opponent
to
dine
with
him
as
they
came
out
of
court
he
accepted
saying
honor
to
every
conqueror
and
complimented
him
on
his
success
without
and
where
did
you
unearth
this
lawyer
said
madame
de
watteville
i
never
heard
his
name
why
you
can
see
his
windows
from
hence
replied
the
monsieur
savaron
lives
in
the
rue
du
perron
the
garden
of
his
house
joins
on
to
but
he
is
not
a
native
of
the
comte
said
monsieur
de
watteville
so
little
is
he
a
native
of
any
place
that
no
one
knows
where
he
comes
from
said
madame
de
chavoncourt
but
who
is
he
asked
madame
de
watteville
taking
the
abbe
s
arm
to
go
into
the
if
he
is
a
stranger
by
what
chance
has
he
settled
at
besancon
it
is
a
strange
fancy
for
a
very
strange
echoed
amedee
de
soulas
whose
biography
is
here
necessary
to
the
understanding
of
this
tale
in
all
ages
france
and
england
have
carried
on
an
exchange
of
trifles
which
is
all
the
more
constant
because
it
evades
the
tyranny
of
the
the
fashion
that
is
called
english
in
paris
is
called
french
in
london
and
this
is
reciprocal
the
hostility
of
the
two
nations
is
suspended
on
two
points
the
uses
of
words
and
the
fashions
of
dress
save
the
the
national
air
of
england
is
a
tune
written
by
lulli
for
the
chorus
of
esther
or
of
athalie
hoops
introduced
at
paris
by
an
englishwoman
were
invented
in
london
it
is
known
why
by
a
frenchwoman
the
notorious
duchess
of
portsmouth
they
were
at
first
so
jeered
at
that
the
first
englishwoman
who
appeared
in
them
at
the
tuileries
narrowly
escaped
being
crushed
by
the
crowd
but
they
were
adopted
this
fashion
tyrannized
over
the
ladies
of
europe
for
half
a
century
at
the
peace
of
for
a
year
the
long
waists
of
the
english
were
a
standing
jest
all
paris
went
to
see
pothier
and
brunet
in
anglaises
pour
but
in
and
the
belt
of
the
frenchwoman
which
in
cut
her
across
the
bosom
gradually
descended
till
it
reached
the
hips
within
ten
years
england
has
made
two
little
gifts
to
our
language
the
the
the
the
three
successes
of
the
of
discreditable
etymology
have
made
way
for
the
dandy
and
the
the
is
not
the
parent
of
the
the
is
due
to
the
famous
song
by
alfred
de
musset
avez
vous
vu
dans
barcelone
c
est
ma
maitresse
et
ma
lionne
there
has
been
a
fusion
or
if
you
prefer
it
a
confusion
of
the
two
words
and
the
leading
ideas
when
an
absurdity
can
amuse
paris
which
devours
as
many
masterpieces
as
absurdities
the
provinces
can
hardly
be
deprived
of
them
so
as
soon
as
the
paraded
paris
with
his
mane
his
beard
and
moustaches
his
waistcoats
and
his
eyeglass
maintained
in
its
place
without
the
help
of
his
hands
by
the
contraction
of
his
cheek
and
the
chief
towns
of
some
departments
had
their
who
protested
by
the
smartness
of
their
against
the
untidiness
of
their
thus
in
besancon
could
boast
of
a
in
the
person
of
monsieur
de
soulas
spelt
souleyas
at
the
time
of
the
spanish
occupation
amedee
de
soulas
is
perhaps
the
only
man
in
besancon
descended
from
a
spanish
family
spain
sent
men
to
manage
her
business
in
the
comte
but
very
few
spaniards
settled
there
the
soulas
remained
in
consequence
of
their
connection
with
cardinal
granvelle
young
monsieur
de
soulas
was
always
talking
of
leaving
besancon
a
dull
town
and
not
literary
a
military
centre
and
garrison
town
of
which
the
manners
and
customs
and
physiognomy
are
worth
describing
this
opinion
allowed
of
his
lodging
like
a
man
uncertain
of
the
future
in
three
very
scantily
furnished
rooms
at
the
end
of
the
rue
neuve
just
where
it
opens
into
the
rue
de
la
prefecture
young
monsieur
de
soulas
could
not
possibly
live
without
a
tiger
this
tiger
was
the
son
of
one
of
his
farmers
a
small
servant
aged
fourteen
and
named
babylas
the
lion
dressed
his
tiger
very
smartly
a
short
of
cloth
belted
with
patent
leather
bright
blue
plush
breeches
a
red
waistcoat
polished
leather
a
shiny
hat
with
black
lacing
and
brass
buttons
with
the
arms
of
soulas
amedee
gave
this
boy
white
cotton
gloves
and
his
washing
and
francs
a
month
to
keep
himself
a
sum
that
seemed
enormous
to
the
grisettes
of
besancon
four
hundred
and
twenty
francs
a
year
to
a
child
of
fifteen
without
counting
extras
the
extras
consisted
in
the
price
for
which
he
could
sell
his
turned
clothes
a
present
when
soulas
exchanged
one
of
his
horses
and
the
perquisite
of
the
manure
the
two
horses
treated
with
sordid
economy
cost
one
with
another
eight
hundred
francs
a
year
his
bills
for
articles
received
from
paris
such
as
perfumery
cravats
jewelry
patent
blacking
and
clothes
ran
to
another
twelve
hundred
francs
add
to
this
the
groom
or
tiger
the
horses
a
very
superior
style
of
dress
and
six
hundred
francs
a
year
for
rent
and
you
will
see
a
grand
total
of
three
thousand
francs
now
monsieur
de
soulas
father
had
left
him
only
four
thousand
francs
a
year
the
income
from
some
cottage
farms
which
lent
painful
uncertainty
to
the
rents
the
lion
had
hardly
three
francs
a
day
left
for
food
amusements
and
gambling
he
very
often
dined
out
and
breakfasted
with
remarkable
frugality
when
he
was
positively
obliged
to
dine
at
his
own
cost
he
sent
his
tiger
to
fetch
a
couple
of
dishes
from
a
cookshop
never
spending
more
than
sous
young
monsieur
de
soulas
was
supposed
to
be
a
spendthrift
recklessly
extravagant
whereas
the
poor
man
made
the
two
ends
meet
in
the
year
with
a
keenness
and
skill
which
would
have
done
honor
to
a
thrifty
housewife
at
besancon
in
those
days
no
one
knew
how
great
a
tax
on
a
man
s
capital
were
six
francs
spent
in
polish
to
spread
on
his
boots
or
shoes
yellow
gloves
at
fifty
sous
a
pair
cleaned
in
the
deepest
secrecy
to
make
them
three
times
renewed
cravats
costing
ten
francs
and
lasting
three
months
four
waistcoats
at
francs
and
trousers
fitting
close
to
the
boots
how
could
he
do
otherwise
since
we
see
women
in
paris
bestowing
their
special
attention
on
simpletons
who
visit
them
and
cut
out
the
most
remarkable
men
by
means
of
these
frivolous
advantages
which
a
man
can
buy
for
fifteen
louis
and
get
his
hair
curled
and
a
fine
linen
shirt
into
the
bargain
if
this
unhappy
youth
should
seem
to
you
to
have
become
a
on
very
cheap
terms
you
must
know
that
amedee
de
soulas
had
been
three
times
to
switzerland
by
coach
and
in
short
stages
twice
to
paris
and
once
from
paris
to
england
he
passed
as
a
traveler
and
could
say
in
england
where
i
went
the
dowagers
of
the
town
would
say
to
him
you
who
have
been
in
england
he
had
been
as
far
as
lombardy
and
seen
the
shores
of
the
italian
lakes
he
read
new
books
finally
when
he
was
cleaning
his
gloves
the
tiger
babylas
replied
to
callers
monsieur
is
very
an
attempt
had
been
made
to
withdraw
monsieur
amedee
de
soulas
from
circulation
by
pronouncing
him
a
man
of
advanced
amedee
had
the
gift
of
uttering
with
the
gravity
of
a
native
the
commonplaces
that
were
in
fashion
which
gave
him
the
credit
of
being
one
of
the
most
enlightened
of
the
nobility
his
person
was
garnished
with
fashionable
trinkets
and
his
head
furnished
with
ideas
by
the
press
in
amedee
was
a
young
man
of
of
medium
height
dark
with
a
very
prominent
thorax
shoulders
rather
plump
legs
feet
already
fat
white
dimpled
hands
a
beard
under
his
chin
moustaches
worthy
of
the
garrison
a
fat
rubicund
face
a
flat
nose
and
brown
expressionless
eyes
nothing
spanish
about
him
he
was
progressing
rapidly
in
the
direction
of
obesity
which
would
be
fatal
to
his
pretensions
his
nails
were
well
kept
his
beard
trimmed
the
smallest
details
of
his
dress
attended
to
with
english
precision
hence
amedee
de
soulas
was
looked
upon
as
the
finest
man
in
besancon
a
hairdresser
who
waited
upon
him
at
a
fixed
hour
another
luxury
costing
sixty
francs
a
year
held
him
up
as
the
sovereign
authority
in
matters
of
fashion
and
elegance
amedee
slept
late
dressed
and
went
out
towards
noon
to
go
to
one
of
his
farms
and
practise
he
attached
as
much
importance
to
this
exercise
as
lord
byron
did
in
his
later
days
then
at
three
o
clock
he
came
home
admired
on
horseback
by
the
grisettes
and
the
ladies
who
happened
to
be
at
their
windows
after
an
affectation
of
study
or
business
which
seemed
to
engage
him
till
four
he
dressed
to
dine
out
spent
the
evening
in
the
of
the
aristocracy
of
besancon
playing
whist
and
went
home
to
bed
at
eleven
no
life
could
be
more
above
board
more
prudent
or
more
irreproachable
for
he
punctually
attended
the
services
at
church
on
sundays
and
holy
days
to
enable
you
to
understand
how
exceptional
is
such
a
life
it
is
necessary
to
devote
a
few
words
to
an
account
of
besancon
no
town
ever
offered
more
deaf
and
dumb
resistance
to
progress
at
besancon
the
officials
the
the
military
in
short
every
one
engaged
in
governing
it
sent
thither
from
paris
to
fill
a
post
of
any
kind
are
all
spoken
of
by
the
expressive
general
name
of
the
colony
is
neutral
ground
the
only
ground
where
as

here
fired
by
a
word

are
started
those
feuds
between
house
and
house
between
a
woman
of
rank
and
a
citizen
s
wife
which
endure
till
death
and
widen
the
impassable
gulf
which
parts
the
two
classes
of
society
with
the
exception
of
the
the

the
de

and
the
gramont
families
with
a
few
others
who
come
only
to
stay
on

the
aristocracy
of

dates
no
further
back
than
a
couple
of
centuries
the
time
of
the
conquest
by
louis
xiv
this
little
world
is
essentially
of
the
and
arrogant
stiff
solemn
uncompromising
haughty
beyond
all
comparison
even
with
the
court
of
vienna
for
in
this
the
nobility
of
besancon
would
put
the
viennese
to
shame
as
to
victor
hugo
nodier
fourier
the
glories
of
the
town
they
are
never
mentioned
no
one
thinks
about
them
the
marriages
in
these
families
are
arranged
in
the
cradle
so
rigidly
are
the
greatest
things
settled
as
well
as
the
smallest
no
stranger
no
intruder
ever
finds
his
way
into
one
of
these
houses

to
obtain
an
introduction
for
the
colonels
or
officers
of
title
belonging
to
the
first
families
in
france
when
quartered
there
requires
efforts
of
diplomacy
which
prince
talleyrand
would
gladly
have
mastered
to
use
at
a
congress
in
amedee
was
the
only
man
in
besancon
who
wore
this
will
account
for
the
young
man
s
being
regarded
as
a
lion
and
a
little
anecdote
will
enable
you
to
understand
the
city
of
besancon
some
time
before
the
opening
of
this
story
the
need
arose
at
the
prefecture
for
bringing
an
editor
from
paris
for
the
official
newspaper
to
enable
it
to
hold
its
own
against
the
little
dropped
at
besancon
by
the
great
and
the
which
frisked
in
the
hands
of
the
republicans
paris
sent
them
a
young
man
knowing
nothing
about
la
franche
comte
who
began
by
writing
them
a
leading
article
of
the
school
of
the
the
chief
of
the
moderate
party
a
member
of
the
municipal
council
sent
for
the
journalist
and
said
to
him
you
must
understand
monsieur
that
we
are
serious
more
than
serious
tiresome
we
resent
being
amused
and
are
furious
at
having
been
made
to
laugh
be
as
hard
of
digestion
as
the
toughest
disquisitions
in
the
revue
des
deux
mondes
and
you
will
hardly
reach
the
level
of
the
editor
took
the
hint
and
thenceforth
spoke
the
most
incomprehensible
philosophical
lingo
his
success
was
complete
if
young
monsieur
de
soulas
did
not
fall
in
the
esteem
of
besancon
society
it
was
out
of
pure
vanity
on
its
part
the
aristocracy
were
happy
to
affect
a
modern
air
and
to
be
able
to
show
any
parisians
of
rank
who
visited
the
comte
a
young
man
who
bore
some
likeness
to
them
all
this
hidden
labor
all
this
dust
thrown
in
people
s
eyes
this
display
of
folly
and
latent
prudence
had
an
object
or
the
of
besancon
would
have
been
no
son
of
the
soil
amedee
wanted
to
achieve
a
good
marriage
by
proving
some
day
that
his
farms
were
not
mortgaged
and
that
he
had
some
savings
he
wanted
to
be
the
talk
of
the
town
to
be
the
finest
and
man
there
in
order
to
win
first
the
attention
and
then
the
hand
of
mademoiselle
rosalie
de
watteville
in
at
the
time
when
young
monsieur
de
soulas
was
setting
up
in
business
as
a
dandy
rosalie
was
but
fourteen
hence
in
mademoiselle
de
watteville
had
reached
the
age
when
young
persons
are
easily
struck
by
the
peculiarities
which
attracted
the
attention
of
the
town
to
amedee
there
are
so
many
who
become
out
of
and
speculation
the
wattevilles
who
for
twelve
years
had
been
drawing
an
income
of
fifty
thousand
francs
a
year
did
not
spend
more
than
thousand
francs
a
year
while
receiving
all
the
upper
circle
of
besancon
every
monday
and
friday
on
monday
they
gave
a
dinner
on
friday
an
evening
party
thus
in
twelve
years
what
a
sum
must
have
accumulated
from
thousand
francs
a
year
saved
and
invested
with
the
judgment
that
distinguishes
those
old
families
it
was
very
generally
supposed
that
madame
de
watteville
thinking
she
had
land
enough
had
placed
her
savings
in
the
three
per
cents
in
rosalie
s
dowry
would
therefore
as
the
best
informed
opined
amount
to
about
twenty
thousand
francs
a
year
so
for
the
last
five
years
amedee
had
worked
like
a
mole
to
get
into
the
highest
favor
of
the
severe
baroness
while
laying
himself
out
to
flatter
mademoiselle
de
watteville
s
conceit
madame
de
watteville
was
in
the
secret
of
the
devices
by
which
amedee
succeeded
in
keeping
up
his
rank
in
besancon
and
esteemed
him
highly
for
it
soulas
had
placed
himself
under
her
wing
when
she
was
thirty
and
at
that
time
had
dared
to
admire
her
and
make
her
his
idol
he
had
got
so
far
as
to
be
allowed
he
alone
in
the
world
to
pour
out
to
her
all
the
unseemly
gossip
which
almost
all
very
precise
women
love
to
hear
being
authorized
by
their
superior
virtue
to
look
into
the
gulf
without
falling
and
into
the
devil
s
snares
without
being
caught
do
you
understand
why
the
lion
did
not
allow
himself
the
very
smallest
intrigue
he
lived
a
public
life
in
the
street
so
to
speak
on
purpose
to
play
the
part
of
a
lover
sacrificed
to
duty
by
the
baroness
and
to
feast
her
mind
with
the
sins
she
had
forbidden
to
her
senses
a
man
who
is
so
privileged
as
to
be
allowed
to
pour
light
stories
into
the
ear
of
a
bigot
is
in
her
eyes
a
charming
man
if
this
exemplary
youth
had
better
known
the
human
heart
he
might
without
risk
have
allowed
himself
some
flirtations
among
the
grisettes
of
besancon
who
looked
up
to
him
as
a
king
his
affairs
might
perhaps
have
been
all
the
more
hopeful
with
the
strict
and
prudish
baroness
to
rosalie
our
cato
affected
prodigality
he
professed
a
life
of
elegance
showing
her
in
perspective
the
splendid
part
played
by
a
woman
of
fashion
in
paris
whither
he
meant
to
go
as
depute
all
these
manoeuvres
were
crowned
with
complete
success
in
the
mothers
of
the
forty
noble
families
composing
the
high
society
of
besancon
quoted
monsieur
amedee
de
soulas
as
the
most
charming
young
man
in
the
town
no
one
would
have
dared
to
dispute
his
place
as
cock
of
the
walk
at
the
hotel
de
rupt
and
all
besancon
regarded
him
as
rosalie
de
watteville
s
future
husband
there
had
even
been
some
exchange
of
ideas
on
the
subject
between
the
baroness
and
amedee
to
which
the
baron
s
apparent
nonentity
gave
some
certainty
mademoiselle
de
watteville
to
whom
her
enormous
prospective
fortune
at
that
time
lent
considerable
importance
had
been
brought
up
exclusively
within
the
precincts
of
the
hotel
de
rupt
which
her
mother
rarely
quitted
so
devoted
was
she
to
her
dear
archbishop
and
severely
repressed
by
an
exclusively
religious
education
and
by
her
mother
s
despotism
which
held
her
rigidly
to
principles
rosalie
knew
absolutely
nothing
is
it
knowledge
to
have
learned
geography
from
guthrie
sacred
history
ancient
history
the
history
of
france
and
the
four
rules
all
passed
through
the
sieve
of
an
old
jesuit
dancing
and
music
were
forbidden
as
being
more
likely
to
corrupt
life
than
to
grace
it
the
baroness
taught
her
daughter
every
conceivable
stitch
in
tapestry
and
women
s
work
plain
sewing
embroidery
netting
at
seventeen
rosalie
had
never
read
anything
but
the
and
some
works
on
heraldry
no
newspaper
had
ever
defiled
her
sight
she
attended
mass
at
the
cathedral
every
morning
taken
there
by
her
mother
came
back
to
breakfast
did
needlework
after
a
little
walk
in
the
garden
and
received
visitors
sitting
with
the
baroness
until
then
after
dinner
excepting
on
mondays
and
fridays
she
accompanied
madame
de
watteville
to
other
houses
to
spend
the
evening
without
being
allowed
to
talk
more
than
the
maternal
rule
permitted
at
eighteen
mademoiselle
de
watteville
was
a
slight
thin
girl
with
a
flat
figure
fair
colorless
and
insignificant
to
the
last
degree
her
eyes
of
a
very
light
blue
borrowed
beauty
from
their
lashes
which
when
downcast
threw
a
shadow
on
her
cheeks
a
few
freckles
marred
the
whiteness
of
her
forehead
which
was
shapely
enough
her
face
was
exactly
like
those
of
albert
durer
s
saints
or
those
of
the
painters
before
perugino
the
same
plump
though
slender
modeling
the
same
delicacy
saddened
by
ecstasy
the
same
severe
guilelessness
everything
about
her
even
to
her
attitude
was
suggestive
of
those
virgins
whose
beauty
is
only
revealed
in
its
mystical
radiance
to
the
eyes
of
the
studious
connoisseur
she
had
fine
hands
though
red
and
a
pretty
foot
the
foot
of
an
aristocrat
she
habitually
wore
simple
checked
cotton
dresses
but
on
sundays
and
in
the
evening
her
mother
allowed
her
silk
the
cut
of
her
frocks
made
at
besancon
almost
made
her
ugly
while
her
mother
tried
to
borrow
grace
beauty
and
elegance
from
paris
fashions
for
through
monsieur
de
soulas
she
procured
the
smallest
trifles
of
her
dress
from
thence
rosalie
had
never
worn
a
pair
of
silk
stockings
or
thin
boots
but
always
cotton
stockings
and
leather
shoes
on
high
days
she
was
dressed
in
a
muslin
frock
her
hair
plainly
dressed
and
had
bronze
kid
shoes
this
education
and
her
own
modest
demeanor
hid
in
rosalie
a
spirit
of
iron
physiologists
and
profound
observers
will
tell
you
perhaps
to
your
astonishment
that
tempers
characteristics
wit
or
genius
reappear
in
families
at
long
intervals
precisely
like
what
are
known
as
hereditary
diseases
thus
talent
like
the
gout
sometimes
skips
over
two
generations
we
have
an
illustrious
example
of
this
phenomenon
in
george
sand
in
whom
are
resuscitated
the
force
the
power
and
the
imaginative
faculty
of
the
marechal
de
saxe
whose
natural
granddaughter
she
is
the
decisive
character
and
romantic
daring
of
the
famous
watteville
had
reappeared
in
the
soul
of
his
reinforced
by
the
tenacity
and
pride
of
blood
of
the
rupts
but
these
qualities
or
faults
if
you
will
have
it
so
were
as
deeply
buried
in
this
young
girlish
soul
apparently
so
weak
and
yielding
as
the
seething
lavas
within
a
hill
before
it
becomes
a
volcano
madame
de
watteville
alone
perhaps
suspected
this
inheritance
from
two
strains
she
was
so
severe
to
her
rosalie
that
she
replied
one
day
to
the
archbishop
who
blamed
her
for
being
too
hard
on
the
child
leave
me
to
manage
her
monseigneur
i
know
her
she
has
more
than
one
beelzebub
in
her
skin
the
baroness
kept
all
the
keener
watch
over
her
daughter
because
she
considered
her
honor
as
a
mother
to
be
at
stake
after
all
she
had
nothing
else
to
do
clotilde
de
rupt
at
this
time
and
as
good
as
widowed
with
a
husband
who
turned
in
every
variety
of
wood
who
set
his
mind
on
making
wheels
with
six
spokes
out
of
and
manufactured
for
everyone
of
his
acquaintance
flirted
in
strict
propriety
with
amedee
de
soulas
when
this
young
man
was
in
the
house
she
alternately
dismissed
and
recalled
her
daughter
and
tried
to
detect
symptoms
of
jealousy
in
that
youthful
soul
so
as
to
have
occasion
to
repress
them
she
imitated
the
police
in
its
dealings
with
the
republicans
but
she
labored
in
vain
rosalie
showed
no
symptoms
of
rebellion
then
the
arid
bigot
accused
her
daughter
of
perfect
insensibility
rosalie
knew
her
mother
well
enough
to
be
sure
that
if
she
had
thought
young
monsieur
de
soulas
she
would
have
drawn
down
on
herself
a
smart
reproof
thus
to
all
her
mother
s
incitement
she
replied
merely
by
such
phrases
as
are
wrongly
called
jesuitical
wrongly
because
the
jesuits
were
strong
and
such
reservations
are
the
de
behind
which
weakness
takes
refuge
then
the
mother
regarded
the
girl
as
a
dissembler
if
by
mischance
a
spark
of
the
true
nature
of
the
wattevilles
and
the
rupts
blazed
out
the
mother
armed
herself
with
the
respect
due
from
children
to
their
parents
to
reduce
rosalie
to
passive
obedience
this
covert
battle
was
carried
on
in
the
most
secret
seclusion
of
domestic
life
with
closed
doors
the
the
dear
abbe
grancey
the
friend
of
the
late
archbishop
clever
as
he
was
in
his
capacity
of
the
chief
father
confessor
of
the
diocese
could
not
discover
whether
the
struggle
had
stirred
up
some
hatred
between
the
mother
and
daughter
whether
the
mother
were
jealous
in
anticipation
or
whether
the
court
amedee
was
paying
to
the
girl
through
her
mother
had
not
overstepped
its
due
limits
being
a
friend
of
the
family
neither
mother
nor
daughter
confessed
to
him
rosalie
a
little
too
much
harried
morally
about
young
de
soulas
could
not
abide
him
to
use
a
homely
phrase
and
when
he
spoke
to
her
trying
to
take
her
heart
by
surprise
she
received
him
but
coldly
this
aversion
discerned
only
by
her
mother
s
eyes
was
a
constant
subject
of
admonition
rosalie
i
can
not
imagine
why
you
affect
such
coldness
towards
amedee
is
it
because
he
is
a
friend
of
the
family
and
because
we
like
him
your
father
and
i
well
mamma
replied
the
poor
child
one
day
if
i
made
him
welcome
should
i
not
be
still
more
in
the
wrong
what
do
you
mean
by
that
cried
madame
de
watteville
what
is
the
meaning
of
such
words
your
mother
is
unjust
no
doubt
and
according
to
you
would
be
so
in
any
case
never
let
such
an
answer
pass
your
lips
again
to
your
mother
and
so
forth
this
quarrel
lasted
three
hours
and
rosalie
noted
the
time
her
mother
pale
with
fury
sent
her
to
her
room
where
rosalie
pondered
on
the
meaning
of
this
scene
without
discovering
it
so
guileless
was
she
thus
young
monsieur
de
soulas
who
was
supposed
by
every
one
to
be
very
near
the
end
he
was
aiming
at
all
neckcloths
set
and
by
dint
of
pots
of
patent
blacking
an
end
which
required
so
much
waxing
of
his
moustaches
so
many
smart
waistcoats
wore
out
so
many
horseshoes
and
stays
for
he
wore
a
leather
vest
the
stays
of
the
amedee
i
say
was
further
away
than
any
chance
comer
although
he
had
on
his
side
the
worthy
and
noble
abbe
de
grancey
madame
said
monsieur
de
soulas
addressing
the
baroness
while
waiting
till
his
soup
was
cool
enough
to
swallow
and
affecting
to
give
a
romantic
turn
to
his
narrative
one
fine
morning
the
mail
coach
dropped
at
the
hotel
national
a
gentleman
from
paris
who
after
seeking
apartments
made
up
his
mind
in
favor
of
the
first
floor
in
mademoiselle
galard
s
house
rue
du
perron
then
the
stranger
went
straight
to
the
mairie
and
had
himself
registered
as
a
resident
with
all
political
qualifications
finally
he
had
his
name
entered
on
the
list
of
the
barristers
to
the
court
showing
his
title
in
due
form
and
he
left
his
card
on
all
his
new
colleagues
the
ministerial
officials
the
councillors
of
the
court
and
the
members
of
the
bench
with
the
name
albert
the
name
of
savaron
is
famous
said
mademoiselle
de
watteville
who
was
strong
in
heraldic
information
the
savarons
of
savarus
are
one
of
the
oldest
noblest
and
richest
families
in
he
is
a
frenchman
and
no
man
s
son
replied
amedee
de
soulas
if
he
wishes
to
bear
the
arms
of
the
savarons
of
savarus
he
must
add
a
there
is
no
one
left
of
the
brabant
family
but
a
mademoiselle
de
savarus
a
rich
heiress
and
the
is
of
course
the
badge
of
a
bastard
but
the
bastard
of
a
comte
de
savarus
is
noble
answered
rosalie
enough
that
will
do
mademoiselle
said
the
baroness
you
insisted
on
her
learning
heraldry
said
monsieur
de
watteville
and
she
knows
it
very
go
on
i
beg
monsieur
de
you
may
suppose
that
in
a
town
where
everything
is
classified
known
ticketed
and
numbered
as
in
besancon
albert
savaron
was
received
without
hesitation
by
the
lawyers
of
the
town
they
were
satisfied
to
say
here
is
a
man
who
does
not
know
his
besancon
who
the
devil
can
have
sent
him
here
what
can
he
hope
to
do
sending
his
card
to
the
judges
instead
of
calling
in
person
what
a
blunder
and
so
three
days
after
savaron
had
ceased
to
exist
he
took
as
his
servant
old
monsieur
galard
s
man
galard
being
dead
jerome
who
can
cook
a
little
albert
savaron
was
all
the
more
completely
forgotten
because
no
one
had
seen
him
or
met
him
then
does
he
not
go
to
mass
asked
madame
de
chavoncourt
he
goes
on
sundays
to
but
to
the
early
service
at
eight
in
the
morning
he
rises
every
night
between
one
and
two
in
the
morning
works
till
eight
has
his
breakfast
and
then
goes
on
working
he
walks
in
his
garden
going
round
fifty
or
perhaps
sixty
times
then
he
goes
in
dines
and
goes
to
bed
between
six
and
how
did
you
learn
all
that
madame
de
chavoncourt
asked
monsieur
de
soulas
in
the
first
place
madame
i
live
in
the
rue
neuve
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
du
perron
i
look
out
on
the
house
where
this
mysterious
personage
lodges
then
of
course
there
are
communications
between
my
tiger
and
and
you
gossip
with
babylas
what
would
you
have
me
do
out
riding
well
and
how
was
it
that
you
engaged
a
stranger
for
your
defence
asked
the
baroness
thus
placing
the
conversation
in
the
hands
of
the
the
president
of
the
court
played
this
pleader
a
trick
by
appointing
him
to
defend
at
the
assizes
a
peasant
accused
of
forgery
but
monsieur
savaron
procured
the
poor
man
s
acquittal
by
proving
his
innocence
and
showing
that
he
had
been
a
tool
in
the
hands
of
the
real
culprits
not
only
did
his
line
of
defence
succeed
but
it
led
to
the
arrest
of
two
of
the
witnesses
who
were
proved
guilty
and
condemned
his
speech
struck
the
court
and
the
jury
one
of
these
a
merchant
placed
a
difficult
case
next
day
in
the
hands
of
monsieur
savaron
and
he
won
it
in
the
position
in
which
we
found
ourselves
monsieur
berryer
finding
it
impossible
to
come
to
besancon
monsieur
de
garcenault
advised
him
to
employ
this
monsieur
albert
savaron
foretelling
our
success
as
soon
as
i
saw
him
and
heard
him
i
felt
faith
in
him
and
i
was
not
is
he
then
so
extraordinary
asked
madame
de
chavoncourt
certainly
madame
replied
the
well
tell
us
about
it
said
madame
de
watteville
the
first
time
i
saw
him
said
the
abbe
de
grancey
he
received
me
in
his
outer
room
next
the
old
galard
s
which
he
has
had
painted
like
old
oak
and
which
i
found
entirely
lined
with
arranged
on
shelves
also
painted
as
old
oak
the
painting
and
the
books
are
the
sole
decoration
of
the
room
for
the
furniture
consists
of
an
old
writing
table
of
carved
wood
six
old
armchairs
covered
with
tapestry
window
curtains
of
gray
stuff
bordered
with
green
and
a
green
carpet
over
the
floor
the
stove
heats
this
library
as
well
as
i
waited
there
i
did
not
picture
my
advocate
as
a
young
man
but
this
singular
setting
is
in
perfect
harmony
with
his
person
for
monsieur
savaron
came
out
in
a
black
merino
tied
with
a
red
cord
red
slippers
a
red
flannel
waistcoat
and
a
red
the
devil
s
colors
exclaimed
madame
de
watteville
yes
said
the
abbe
but
a
magnificent
head
black
hair
already
streaked
with
a
little
gray
hair
like
that
of
saint
peter
and
saint
paul
in
pictures
with
thick
shining
curls
hair
as
stiff
as
a
round
white
throat
like
a
woman
s
a
splendid
forehead
furrowed
by
the
strong
median
line
which
great
schemes
great
thoughts
deep
meditations
stamp
on
a
great
man
s
brow
an
olive
complexion
marbled
with
red
a
square
nose
eyes
of
flame
hollow
cheeks
with
two
long
lines
betraying
much
suffering
a
mouth
with
a
sardonic
smile
and
a
small
chin
narrow
and
too
short
crow
s
feet
on
his
temples
eyes
moving
in
their
sockets
like
burning
balls
but
in
spite
of
all
these
indications
of
a
violently
passionate
nature
his
manner
was
calm
deeply
resigned
and
his
voice
of
penetrating
sweetness
which
surprised
me
in
court
by
its
easy
flow
a
true
orator
s
voice
now
clear
and
appealing
sometimes
insinuating
but
a
voice
of
thunder
when
needful
and
lending
itself
to
sarcasm
to
become
incisive
monsieur
albert
savaron
is
of
middle
height
neither
stout
nor
thin
and
his
hands
are
those
of
a
prelate
the
second
time
i
called
on
him
he
received
me
in
his
adjoining
the
library
and
smiled
at
my
astonishment
when
i
saw
there
a
wretched
chest
of
drawers
a
shabby
carpet
a
and
cotton
he
came
out
of
his
private
room
to
which
no
one
is
admitted
as
jerome
informed
me
the
man
did
not
go
in
but
merely
knocked
at
the
door
the
third
time
he
was
breakfasting
in
his
library
on
the
most
frugal
fare
but
on
this
occasion
as
he
had
spent
the
night
studying
our
documents
as
i
had
my
attorney
with
me
and
as
that
worthy
monsieur
girardet
is
i
had
leisure
to
study
the
stranger
he
certainly
is
no
ordinary
man
there
is
more
than
one
secret
behind
that
face
at
once
so
terrible
and
so
gentle
patient
and
yet
impatient
broad
and
yet
hollow
i
saw
too
that
he
stooped
a
little
like
all
men
who
have
some
heavy
burden
to
why
did
so
eloquent
a
man
leave
paris
for
what
purpose
did
he
come
to
besancon
asked
pretty
madame
de
chavoncourt
could
no
one
tell
him
how
little
chance
a
stranger
has
of
succeeding
here
the
good
folks
of
besancon
will
make
use
of
him
but
they
will
not
allow
him
to
make
use
of
them
why
having
come
did
he
make
so
little
effort
that
it
needed
a
freak
of
the
president
s
to
bring
him
forward
after
carefully
studying
that
fine
head
said
the
abbe
looking
keenly
at
the
lady
who
had
interrupted
him
in
such
a
way
as
to
suggest
that
there
was
something
he
would
not
tell
and
especially
after
hearing
him
this
morning
reply
to
one
of
the
bigwigs
of
the
paris
bar
i
believe
that
this
man
who
may
be
will
by
and
by
make
a
great
why
should
we
discuss
him
you
have
gained
your
action
and
paid
him
said
madame
de
watteville
watching
her
daughter
who
all
the
time
the
had
been
speaking
seemed
to
hang
on
his
lips
the
conversation
changed
and
no
more
was
heard
of
albert
savaron
the
portrait
sketched
by
the
cleverest
of
the
of
the
diocese
had
all
the
greater
charm
for
rosalie
because
there
was
a
romance
behind
it
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
had
come
across
the
marvelous
the
exceptional
which
smiles
on
every
youthful
imagination
and
which
curiosity
so
eager
at
rosalie
s
age
goes
forth
to
meet
what
an
ideal
being
was
this
albert
gloomy
unhappy
eloquent
laborious
as
compared
by
mademoiselle
de
watteville
to
that
chubby
fat
count
bursting
with
health
paying
compliments
and
talking
of
the
fashions
in
the
very
face
of
the
splendor
of
the
old
counts
of
rupt
amedee
had
cost
her
many
quarrels
and
scoldings
and
indeed
she
knew
him
only
too
well
while
this
albert
savaron
offered
many
enigmas
to
be
solved
albert
savaron
de
savarus
she
repeated
to
herself
now
to
see
him
to
catch
sight
of
him
this
was
the
desire
of
the
girl
to
whom
desire
was
hitherto
unknown
she
pondered
in
her
heart
in
her
fancy
in
her
brain
the
least
phrases
used
by
the
abbe
de
grancey
for
all
his
words
had
told
a
fine
forehead
said
she
to
herself
looking
at
the
head
of
every
man
seated
at
the
table
i
do
not
see
one
fine
monsieur
de
soulas
is
too
prominent
monsieur
de
grancey
s
is
fine
but
he
is
seventy
and
has
no
hair
it
is
impossible
to
see
where
his
forehead
what
is
the
matter
rosalie
you
are
eating
nothing
i
am
not
hungry
mamma
said
she
a
prelate
s
hands
she
went
on
to
herself
i
can
not
remember
our
handsome
archbishop
s
hands
though
he
confirmed
finally
in
the
midst
of
her
coming
and
going
in
the
labyrinth
of
her
meditations
she
remembered
a
lighted
window
she
had
seen
from
her
bed
gleaming
through
the
trees
of
the
two
adjoining
gardens
when
she
had
happened
to
wake
in
the
night
then
that
was
his
light
thought
she
i
might
see
him
i
will
see
monsieur
de
grancey
is
the
chapter
s
lawsuit
quite
settled
said
rosalie
to
the
during
a
moment
of
silence
madame
de
watteville
exchanged
rapid
glances
with
the
what
can
that
matter
to
you
my
dear
child
she
said
to
rosalie
with
an
affected
sweetness
which
made
her
daughter
cautious
for
the
rest
of
her
days
it
might
be
carried
to
the
court
of
appeal
but
our
adversaries
will
think
twice
about
that
replied
the
abbe
i
never
could
have
believed
that
rosalie
would
think
about
a
lawsuit
all
through
a
dinner
remarked
madame
de
watteville
nor
i
either
said
rosalie
in
a
dreamy
way
that
made
every
one
laugh
but
monsieur
de
grancey
was
so
full
of
it
that
i
was
the
company
rose
from
table
and
returned
to
the
all
through
the
evening
rosalie
listened
in
case
albert
savaron
should
be
mentioned
again
but
beyond
the
congratulations
offered
by
each
newcomer
to
the
abbe
on
having
gained
his
suit
to
which
no
one
added
any
praise
of
the
advocate
no
more
was
said
about
it
mademoiselle
de
watteville
impatiently
looked
forward
to
bedtime
she
had
promised
herself
to
wake
at
between
two
and
three
in
the
morning
and
to
look
at
albert
s
windows
when
the
hour
came
she
felt
almost
pleasure
in
gazing
at
the
glimmer
from
the
lawyer
s
candles
that
shone
through
the
trees
now
almost
bare
of
their
leaves
by
the
help
of
the
strong
sight
of
a
young
girl
which
curiosity
seems
to
make
longer
she
saw
albert
writing
and
fancied
she
could
distinguish
the
color
of
the
furniture
which
she
thought
was
red
from
the
chimney
above
the
roof
rose
a
thick
column
of
smoke
while
all
the
world
is
sleeping
he
is
awake
like
god
thought
she
the
education
of
girls
brings
with
it
such
serious
problems
for
the
future
of
a
nation
is
in
the
mother
that
the
university
of
france
long
since
set
itself
the
task
of
having
nothing
to
do
with
it
here
is
one
of
these
problems
ought
girls
to
be
informed
on
all
points
ought
their
minds
to
be
under
restraint
it
need
not
be
said
that
the
religious
system
is
one
of
restraint
if
you
enlighten
them
you
make
them
demons
before
their
time
if
you
keep
them
from
thinking
you
end
in
the
sudden
explosion
so
well
shown
by
moliere
in
the
character
of
agnes
and
you
leave
this
suppressed
mind
so
fresh
and
as
swift
and
as
logical
as
that
of
a
savage
at
the
mercy
of
an
accident
this
inevitable
crisis
was
brought
on
in
mademoiselle
de
watteville
by
the
portrait
which
one
of
the
most
prudent
abbes
of
the
chapter
of
besancon
imprudently
allowed
himself
to
sketch
at
a
dinner
party
next
morning
mademoiselle
de
watteville
while
dressing
necessarily
looked
out
at
albert
savaron
walking
in
the
garden
adjoining
that
of
the
hotel
de
rupt
what
would
have
become
of
me
thought
she
if
he
had
lived
anywhere
else
here
i
can
at
any
rate
see
what
is
he
thinking
about
having
seen
this
extraordinary
man
though
at
a
distance
the
only
man
whose
countenance
stood
forth
in
contrast
with
crowds
of
besancon
faces
she
had
hitherto
met
with
rosalie
at
once
jumped
at
the
idea
of
getting
into
his
house
of
ascertaining
the
reason
of
so
much
mystery
of
hearing
that
eloquent
voice
of
winning
a
glance
from
those
fine
eyes
all
this
she
set
her
heart
on
but
how
could
she
achieve
it
all
that
day
she
drew
her
needle
through
her
embroidery
with
the
obtuse
concentration
of
a
girl
who
like
agnes
seems
to
be
thinking
of
nothing
but
who
is
reflecting
on
things
in
general
so
deeply
that
her
artifice
is
unfailing
as
a
result
of
this
profound
meditation
rosalie
thought
she
would
go
to
confession
next
morning
after
mass
she
had
a
brief
interview
with
the
abbe
giroud
at
and
managed
so
ingeniously
that
the
hour
of
her
confession
was
fixed
for
sunday
morning
at
seven
before
the
eight
o
clock
mass
she
committed
herself
to
a
dozen
fibs
in
order
to
find
herself
just
for
once
in
the
church
at
the
hour
when
the
lawyer
came
to
mass
then
she
was
seized
with
an
impulse
of
extreme
affection
for
her
father
she
went
to
see
him
in
his
workroom
and
asked
him
for
all
sorts
of
information
on
the
art
of
turning
ending
by
advising
him
to
turn
larger
pieces
columns
after
persuading
her
father
to
set
to
work
on
some
twisted
pillars
one
of
the
difficulties
of
the
turner
s
art
she
suggested
that
he
should
make
use
of
a
large
heap
of
stones
that
lay
in
the
middle
of
the
garden
to
construct
a
sort
of
grotto
on
which
he
might
erect
a
little
temple
or
belvedere
in
which
his
twisted
pillars
could
be
used
and
shown
off
to
all
the
world
at
the
climax
of
the
pleasure
the
poor
unoccupied
man
derived
from
this
scheme
rosalie
said
as
she
kissed
him
above
all
do
not
tell
mamma
who
gave
you
the
notion
she
would
scold
do
not
be
afraid
replied
monsieur
de
watteville
who
groaned
as
bitterly
as
his
daughter
under
the
tyranny
of
the
terrible
descendant
of
the
rupts
so
rosalie
had
a
certain
prospect
of
seeing
ere
long
a
charming
observatory
built
whence
her
eye
would
command
the
lawyer
s
private
room
and
there
are
men
for
whose
sake
young
girls
can
carry
out
such
masterstrokes
of
diplomacy
while
for
the
most
part
like
albert
savaron
they
know
it
not
the
sunday
so
impatiently
looked
for
arrived
and
rosalie
dressed
with
such
carefulness
as
made
mariette
the
ladies
smile
it
is
the
first
time
i
ever
knew
mademoiselle
to
be
so
fidgety
said
mariette
it
strikes
me
said
rosalie
with
a
glance
at
mariette
which
brought
poppies
to
her
cheeks
that
you
too
are
more
particular
on
some
days
than
on
as
she
went
down
the
steps
across
the
courtyard
and
through
the
gates
rosalie
s
heart
beat
as
everybody
s
does
in
anticipation
of
a
great
event
hitherto
she
had
never
known
what
it
was
to
walk
in
the
streets
for
a
moment
she
had
felt
as
though
her
mother
must
read
her
schemes
on
her
brow
and
forbid
her
going
to
confession
and
she
now
felt
new
blood
in
her
feet
she
lifted
them
as
though
she
trod
on
fire
she
had
of
course
arranged
to
be
with
her
confessor
at
a
eight
telling
her
mother
eight
so
as
to
have
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
near
albert
she
got
to
church
before
mass
and
after
a
short
prayer
went
to
see
if
the
abbe
giroud
were
in
his
confessional
simply
to
pass
the
time
and
she
thus
placed
herself
in
such
a
way
as
to
see
albert
as
he
came
into
church
the
man
must
have
been
atrociously
ugly
who
did
not
seem
handsome
to
mademoiselle
de
watteville
in
the
frame
of
mind
produced
by
her
curiosity
and
albert
savaron
who
was
really
very
striking
made
all
the
more
impression
on
rosalie
because
his
mien
his
walk
his
carriage
everything
down
to
his
clothing
had
the
indescribable
stamp
which
can
only
be
expressed
by
the
word
mystery
he
came
in
the
church
till
now
gloomy
seemed
to
rosalie
to
be
illuminated
the
girl
was
fascinated
by
his
slow
and
solemn
demeanor
as
of
a
man
who
bears
a
world
on
his
shoulders
and
whose
deep
gaze
whose
very
gestures
combine
to
express
a
devastating
or
absorbing
thought
rosalie
now
understood
the
s
words
in
their
fullest
extent
yes
those
eyes
of
tawny
brown
shot
with
golden
lights
covered
ardor
which
revealed
itself
in
sudden
flashes
rosalie
with
a
recklessness
which
mariette
noted
stood
in
the
lawyer
s
way
so
as
to
exchange
glances
with
him
and
this
glance
turned
her
blood
for
it
seethed
and
boiled
as
though
its
warmth
were
doubled
as
soon
as
albert
had
taken
a
seat
mademoiselle
de
watteville
quickly
found
a
place
whence
she
could
see
him
perfectly
during
all
the
time
the
abbe
might
leave
her
when
mariette
said
here
is
monsieur
giroud
it
seemed
to
rosalie
that
the
interview
had
lasted
no
more
than
a
few
minutes
by
the
time
she
came
out
from
the
confessional
mass
was
over
albert
had
left
the
church
the
was
right
thought
she
is
unhappy
why
should
this
eagle
for
he
has
the
eyes
of
an
eagle
swoop
down
on
besancon
oh
i
must
know
everything
but
how
under
the
smart
of
this
new
desire
rosalie
set
the
stitches
of
her
with
exquisite
precision
and
hid
her
meditations
under
a
little
innocent
air
which
shammed
simplicity
to
deceive
madame
de
watteville
from
that
sunday
when
mademoiselle
de
watteville
had
met
that
look
or
if
you
please
received
this
baptism
of
fire
a
fine
expression
of
napoleon
s
which
may
be
well
applied
to
love
she
eagerly
promoted
the
plan
for
the
belvedere
mamma
said
she
one
day
when
two
columns
were
turned
my
father
has
taken
a
singular
idea
into
his
head
he
is
turning
columns
for
a
belvedere
he
intends
to
erect
on
the
heap
of
stones
in
the
middle
of
the
garden
do
you
approve
of
it
it
seems
to
me
i
approve
of
everything
your
father
does
said
madame
de
watteville
drily
and
it
is
a
wife
s
duty
to
submit
to
her
husband
even
if
she
does
not
approve
of
his
ideas
why
should
i
object
to
a
thing
which
is
of
no
importance
in
itself
if
only
it
amuses
monsieur
de
watteville
well
because
from
thence
we
shall
see
into
monsieur
de
soulas
rooms
and
monsieur
de
soulas
will
see
us
when
we
are
there
perhaps
remarks
may
be
made
do
you
presume
rosalie
to
guide
your
parents
and
think
you
know
more
than
they
do
of
life
and
the
proprieties
i
say
no
more
mamma
besides
my
father
said
that
there
would
be
a
room
in
the
grotto
where
it
would
be
cool
and
where
we
can
take
your
father
has
had
an
excellent
idea
said
madame
de
watteville
who
forthwith
went
to
look
at
the
columns
she
gave
her
entire
approbation
to
the
baron
de
watteville
s
design
while
choosing
for
the
erection
of
this
monument
a
spot
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
which
could
not
be
seen
from
monsieur
de
soulas
windows
but
whence
they
could
perfectly
see
into
albert
savaron
s
rooms
a
builder
was
sent
for
who
undertook
to
construct
a
grotto
of
which
the
top
should
be
reached
by
a
path
three
feet
wide
through
the
where
periwinkles
would
grow
iris
clematis
ivy
honeysuckle
and
virginia
creeper
the
baroness
desired
that
the
inside
should
be
lined
with
rustic
such
as
was
then
the
fashion
for
with
a
against
the
wall
an
ottoman
forming
a
box
and
a
table
of
inlaid
bark
monsieur
de
soulas
proposed
that
the
floor
should
be
of
asphalt
rosalie
suggested
a
hanging
chandelier
of
rustic
wood
the
wattevilles
are
having
something
charming
done
in
their
garden
was
rumored
in
besancon
they
are
rich
and
can
afford
a
thousand
crowns
for
a
whim
a
thousand
crowns
exclaimed
madame
de
chavoncourt
yes
a
thousand
crowns
cried
young
monsieur
de
soulas
a
man
has
been
sent
for
from
paris
to
rusticate
the
interior
but
it
will
be
very
pretty
monsieur
de
watteville
himself
is
making
the
chandelier
and
has
begun
to
carve
the
berquet
is
to
make
a
cellar
under
it
said
an
abbe
no
replied
young
monsieur
de
soulas
he
is
raising
the
kiosk
on
a
concrete
foundation
that
it
may
not
be
you
know
the
very
least
things
that
are
done
in
that
house
said
madame
de
chavoncourt
sourly
as
she
looked
at
one
of
her
great
girls
waiting
to
be
married
for
a
year
past
mademoiselle
de
watteville
with
a
little
flush
of
pride
in
thinking
of
the
success
of
her
belvedere
discerned
in
herself
a
vast
superiority
over
every
one
about
her
no
one
guessed
that
a
little
girl
supposed
to
be
a
witless
goose
had
simply
made
up
her
mind
to
get
a
closer
view
of
the
lawyer
savaron
s
private
study
albert
savaron
s
brilliant
defence
of
the
cathedral
chapter
was
all
the
sooner
forgotten
because
the
envy
of
the
other
lawyers
was
aroused
also
savaron
faithful
to
his
seclusion
went
nowhere
having
no
friends
to
cry
him
up
and
seeing
no
one
he
increased
the
chances
of
being
forgotten
which
are
common
to
strangers
in
besancon
nevertheless
he
pleaded
three
times
at
the
commercial
tribunal
in
three
knotty
cases
which
had
to
be
carried
to
the
superior
court
he
thus
gained
as
clients
four
of
the
chief
merchants
of
the
place
who
discerned
in
him
so
much
good
sense
and
sound
legal
purview
that
they
placed
their
claims
in
his
hands
on
the
day
when
the
watteville
family
inaugurated
the
belvedere
savaron
also
was
founding
a
monument
thanks
to
the
connections
he
had
obscurely
formed
among
the
upper
class
of
merchants
in
besancon
he
was
starting
a
fortnightly
paper
called
the
with
the
help
of
forty
shares
of
five
hundred
francs
each
taken
up
by
his
first
ten
clients
on
whom
he
had
impressed
the
necessity
for
promoting
the
interests
of
besancon
the
town
where
the
traffic
should
meet
between
mulhouse
and
lyons
and
the
chief
centre
between
mulhouse
and
rhone
to
compete
with
strasbourg
was
it
not
needful
that
besancon
should
become
a
focus
of
enlightenment
as
well
as
of
trade
the
leading
questions
relating
to
the
interests
of
eastern
france
could
only
be
dealt
with
in
a
review
what
a
glorious
task
to
rob
strasbourg
and
dijon
of
their
literary
importance
to
bring
light
to
the
east
of
france
and
compete
with
the
centralizing
influence
of
paris
these
reflections
put
forward
by
albert
were
repeated
by
the
ten
merchants
who
believed
them
to
be
their
own
monsieur
savaron
did
not
commit
the
blunder
of
putting
his
name
in
front
he
left
the
finance
of
the
concern
to
his
chief
client
monsieur
boucher
connected
by
marriage
with
one
of
the
great
publishers
of
important
ecclesiastical
works
but
he
kept
the
editorship
with
a
share
of
the
profits
as
founder
the
commercial
interest
appealed
to
dole
to
dijon
to
salins
to
neufchatel
to
the
jura
bourg
nantua
the
concurrence
was
invited
of
the
learning
and
energy
of
every
scientific
student
in
the
districts
of
le
bugey
la
bresse
and
franche
comte
by
the
influence
of
commercial
interests
and
common
feeling
five
hundred
subscribers
were
booked
in
consideration
of
the
low
price
the
cost
eight
francs
a
quarter
to
avoid
hurting
the
conceit
of
the
provincials
by
refusing
their
articles
the
lawyer
hit
on
the
good
idea
of
suggesting
a
desire
for
the
literary
management
of
this
to
monsieur
boucher
s
eldest
son
a
young
man
of
very
eager
for
fame
to
whom
the
snares
and
woes
of
literary
responsibilities
were
utterly
unknown
albert
quietly
kept
the
upper
hand
and
made
alfred
boucher
his
devoted
adherent
alfred
was
the
only
man
in
besancon
with
whom
the
king
of
the
bar
was
on
familiar
terms
alfred
came
in
the
morning
to
discuss
the
articles
for
the
next
number
with
albert
in
the
garden
it
is
needless
to
say
that
the
trial
number
contained
a
meditation
by
alfred
which
savaron
approved
in
his
conversations
with
alfred
albert
would
let
drop
some
great
ideas
subjects
for
articles
of
which
alfred
availed
himself
and
thus
the
merchant
s
son
fancied
he
was
making
capital
out
of
the
great
man
to
alfred
albert
was
a
man
of
genius
of
profound
politics
the
commercial
world
enchanted
at
the
success
of
the
had
to
pay
up
only
of
their
shares
two
hundred
more
subscribers
and
the
periodical
would
pay
a
dividend
to
the
of
five
per
cent
the
editor
remaining
unpaid
this
editing
indeed
was
beyond
price
after
the
third
number
the
was
recognized
for
exchange
by
all
the
papers
published
in
france
which
albert
henceforth
read
at
home
this
third
number
included
a
tale
signed
a
and
attributed
to
the
famous
lawyer
in
spite
of
the
small
attention
paid
by
the
higher
circle
of
besancon
to
the
which
was
accused
of
liberal
views
this
the
first
novel
produced
in
the
county
came
under
discussion
that
at
madame
de
chavoncourt
s
papa
said
rosalie
a
is
published
in
besancon
you
ought
to
take
it
in
and
keep
it
in
your
room
for
mamma
would
not
let
me
read
it
but
you
will
lend
it
to
monsieur
de
watteville
eager
to
obey
his
dear
rosalie
who
for
the
last
five
months
had
given
him
so
many
proofs
of
filial
affection
monsieur
de
watteville
went
in
person
to
subscribe
for
a
year
to
the
and
lent
the
four
numbers
already
out
to
his
daughter
in
the
course
of
the
night
rosalie
devoured
the
tale
the
first
she
had
ever
read
in
her
life
but
she
had
only
known
life
for
two
months
past
hence
the
effect
produced
on
her
by
this
work
must
not
be
judged
by
ordinary
rules
without
prejudice
of
any
kind
as
to
the
greater
or
less
merit
of
this
composition
from
the
pen
of
a
parisian
who
had
thus
imported
into
the
province
the
manner
the
brilliancy
if
you
will
of
the
new
literary
school
it
could
not
fail
to
be
a
masterpiece
to
a
young
girl
abandoning
all
her
intelligence
and
her
innocent
heart
to
her
first
reading
of
this
kind
also
from
what
she
had
heard
said
rosalie
had
by
intuition
conceived
a
notion
of
it
which
strangely
enhanced
the
interest
of
this
novel
she
hoped
to
find
in
it
the
sentiments
and
perhaps
something
of
the
life
of
albert
from
the
first
pages
this
opinion
took
so
strong
a
hold
on
her
that
after
reading
the
fragment
to
the
end
she
was
certain
that
it
was
no
mistake
here
then
is
this
confession
in
which
according
to
the
critics
of
madame
de
chavoncourt
s
albert
had
imitated
some
modern
writers
who
for
lack
of
inventiveness
relate
their
private
joys
their
private
griefs
or
the
mysterious
events
of
their
own
life
ambition
for
love
s
sake
in
two
young
men
having
agreed
as
a
plan
for
a
holiday
to
make
a
tour
through
switzerland
set
out
from
lucerne
one
fine
morning
in
the
month
of
july
in
a
boat
pulled
by
three
oarsmen
they
started
for
fluelen
intending
to
stop
at
every
notable
spot
on
the
lake
of
the
four
cantons
the
views
which
shut
in
the
waters
on
the
way
from
lucerne
to
fluelen
offer
every
combination
that
the
most
exacting
fancy
can
demand
of
mountains
and
rivers
lakes
and
rocks
brooks
and
pastures
trees
and
torrents
here
are
austere
solitudes
and
charming
headlands
smiling
and
trimly
kept
meadows
forests
crowning
perpendicular
granite
cliffs
like
plumes
deserted
but
verdant
reaches
opening
out
and
valleys
whose
beauty
seems
the
lovelier
in
the
dreamy
distance
as
they
passed
the
pretty
hamlet
of
gersau
one
of
the
friends
looked
for
a
long
time
at
a
wooden
house
which
seemed
to
have
been
recently
built
enclosed
by
a
paling
and
standing
on
a
promontory
almost
bathed
by
the
waters
as
the
boat
rowed
past
a
woman
s
head
was
raised
against
the
background
of
the
room
on
the
upper
story
of
this
house
to
admire
the
effect
of
the
boat
on
the
lake
one
of
the
young
men
met
the
glance
thus
indifferently
given
by
the
unknown
fair
let
us
stop
here
said
he
to
his
friend
we
meant
to
make
lucerne
our
headquarters
for
seeing
switzerland
you
will
not
take
it
amiss
leopold
if
i
change
my
mind
and
stay
here
to
take
charge
of
our
possessions
then
you
can
go
where
you
please
my
journey
is
ended
pull
to
land
men
and
put
us
out
at
this
village
we
will
breakfast
here
i
will
go
back
to
lucerne
to
fetch
all
our
luggage
and
before
you
leave
you
will
know
in
which
house
i
take
a
lodging
where
you
will
find
me
on
your
here
or
at
lucerne
replied
leopold
the
difference
is
not
so
great
that
i
need
hinder
you
from
following
your
these
two
youths
were
friends
in
the
truest
sense
of
the
word
they
were
of
the
same
age
they
had
learned
at
the
same
school
and
after
studying
the
law
they
were
spending
their
holiday
in
the
classical
tour
in
switzerland
leopold
by
his
father
s
determination
was
already
pledged
to
a
place
in
a
notary
s
office
in
paris
his
spirit
of
rectitude
his
gentleness
and
the
coolness
of
his
senses
and
his
brain
guaranteed
him
to
be
a
docile
pupil
leopold
could
see
himself
a
notary
in
paris
his
life
lay
before
him
like
one
of
the
highroads
that
cross
the
plains
of
france
and
he
looked
along
its
whole
length
with
philosophical
resignation
the
character
of
his
companion
whom
we
will
call
rodolphe
presented
a
strong
contrast
with
leopold
s
and
their
antagonism
had
no
doubt
had
the
result
of
tightening
the
bond
that
united
them
rodolphe
was
the
natural
son
of
a
man
of
rank
who
was
carried
off
by
a
premature
death
before
he
could
make
any
arrangements
for
securing
the
means
of
existence
to
a
woman
he
fondly
loved
and
to
rodolphe
thus
cheated
by
a
stroke
of
fate
rodolphe
s
mother
had
recourse
to
a
heroic
measure
she
sold
everything
she
owed
to
the
munificence
of
her
child
s
father
for
a
sum
of
more
than
a
hundred
thousand
francs
bought
with
it
a
life
annuity
for
herself
at
a
high
rate
and
thus
acquired
an
income
of
about
fifteen
thousand
francs
resolving
to
devote
the
whole
of
it
to
the
education
of
her
son
so
as
to
give
him
all
the
personal
advantages
that
might
help
to
make
his
fortune
while
saving
by
strict
economy
a
small
capital
to
be
his
when
he
came
of
age
it
was
bold
it
was
counting
on
her
own
life
but
without
this
boldness
the
good
mother
would
certainly
have
found
it
impossible
to
live
and
to
bring
her
child
up
suitably
and
he
was
her
only
hope
her
future
the
spring
of
all
her
joys
rodolphe
the
son
of
a
most
charming
parisian
woman
and
a
man
of
mark
a
nobleman
of
brabant
was
cursed
with
extreme
sensitiveness
from
his
infancy
he
had
in
everything
shown
a
most
ardent
nature
in
him
mere
desire
became
a
guiding
force
and
the
motive
power
of
his
whole
being
the
stimulus
to
his
imagination
the
reason
of
his
actions
notwithstanding
the
pains
taken
by
a
clever
mother
who
was
alarmed
when
she
detected
this
predisposition
rodolphe
wished
for
things
as
a
poet
imagines
as
a
mathematician
calculates
as
a
painter
sketches
as
a
musician
creates
melodies
like
his
mother
he
dashed
with
inconceivable
violence
and
impetus
of
thought
after
the
object
of
his
desires
he
annihilated
time
while
dreaming
of
the
fulfilment
of
his
schemes
he
always
overlooked
the
means
of
attainment
when
my
son
has
children
said
his
other
he
will
want
them
born
grown
this
fine
frenzy
carefully
directed
enabled
rodolphe
to
achieve
his
studies
with
brilliant
results
and
to
become
what
the
english
call
an
accomplished
gentleman
his
mother
was
then
proud
of
him
though
still
fearing
a
catastrophe
if
ever
a
passion
should
possess
a
heart
at
once
so
tender
and
so
susceptible
so
vehement
and
so
kind
therefore
the
judicious
mother
had
encouraged
the
friendship
which
bound
leopold
to
rodolphe
and
rodolphe
to
leopold
since
she
saw
in
the
cold
and
faithful
young
notary
a
guardian
a
comrade
who
might
to
a
certain
extent
take
her
place
if
by
some
misfortune
she
should
be
lost
to
her
son
rodolphe
s
mother
still
handsome
at
had
inspired
leopold
with
an
ardent
passion
this
circumstance
made
the
two
young
men
even
more
intimate
so
leopold
knowing
rodolphe
well
was
not
surprised
to
find
him
stopping
at
a
village
and
giving
up
the
projected
journey
to
on
the
strength
of
a
single
glance
at
the
upper
window
of
a
house
while
breakfast
was
prepared
for
them
at
the
swan
inn
the
friends
walked
round
the
hamlet
and
came
to
the
neighborhood
of
the
pretty
new
house
here
while
gazing
about
him
and
talking
to
the
inhabitants
rodolphe
discovered
the
residence
of
some
decent
folk
who
were
willing
to
take
him
as
a
boarder
a
very
frequent
custom
in
switzerland
they
offered
him
a
bedroom
looking
over
the
lake
and
the
mountains
and
from
whence
he
had
a
view
of
one
of
those
immense
sweeping
reaches
which
in
this
lake
are
the
admiration
of
every
traveler
this
house
was
divided
by
a
roadway
and
a
little
creek
from
the
new
house
where
rodolphe
had
caught
sight
of
the
unknown
fair
one
s
face
for
a
hundred
francs
a
month
rodolphe
was
relieved
of
all
thought
for
the
necessaries
of
life
but
in
consideration
of
the
outlay
the
stopfer
couple
expected
to
make
they
bargained
for
three
months
residence
and
a
month
s
payment
in
advance
rub
a
swiss
ever
so
little
and
you
find
the
usurer
after
breakfast
rodolphe
at
once
made
himself
at
home
by
depositing
in
his
room
such
property
as
he
had
brought
with
him
for
the
journey
to
the
and
he
watched
leopold
as
he
set
out
moved
by
the
spirit
of
routine
to
carry
out
the
excursion
for
himself
and
his
friend
when
rodolphe
sitting
on
a
fallen
rock
on
the
shore
could
no
longer
see
leopold
s
boat
he
turned
to
examine
the
new
house
with
stolen
glances
hoping
to
see
the
fair
unknown
alas
he
went
in
without
its
having
given
a
sign
of
life
during
dinner
in
the
company
of
monsieur
and
madame
stopfer
retired
coopers
from
neufchatel
he
questioned
them
as
to
the
neighborhood
and
ended
by
learning
all
he
wanted
to
know
about
the
lady
thanks
to
his
hosts
loquacity
for
they
were
ready
to
pour
out
their
budget
of
gossip
without
any
pressing
the
fair
stranger
s
name
was
fanny
lovelace
this
name
pronounced
is
that
of
an
old
english
family
but
richardson
has
given
it
to
a
creation
whose
fame
eclipses
all
others
miss
lovelace
had
come
to
settle
by
the
lake
for
her
father
s
health
the
physicians
having
recommended
him
the
air
of
lucerne
these
two
english
people
had
arrived
with
no
other
servant
than
a
little
girl
of
fourteen
a
dumb
child
much
attached
to
miss
fanny
on
whom
she
waited
very
intelligently
and
had
settled
two
winters
since
with
monsieur
and
madame
bergmann
the
retired
of
his
excellency
count
borromeo
of
isola
bella
and
isola
madre
in
the
lago
maggiore
these
swiss
who
were
possessed
of
an
income
of
about
a
thousand
crowns
a
year
had
let
the
top
story
of
their
house
to
the
lovelaces
for
three
years
at
a
rent
of
two
hundred
francs
a
year
old
lovelace
a
man
of
ninety
and
much
broken
was
too
poor
to
allow
himself
any
gratifications
and
very
rarely
went
out
his
daughter
worked
to
maintain
him
translating
english
books
and
writing
some
herself
it
was
said
the
lovelaces
could
not
afford
to
hire
boats
to
row
on
the
lake
or
horses
and
guides
to
explore
the
neighborhood
poverty
demanding
such
privation
as
this
excites
all
the
greater
compassion
among
the
swiss
because
it
deprives
them
of
a
chance
of
profit
the
cook
of
the
establishment
fed
the
three
english
boarders
for
a
hundred
francs
a
month
inclusive
in
gersau
it
was
generally
believed
however
that
the
gardener
and
his
wife
in
spite
of
their
pretensions
used
the
cook
s
name
as
a
screen
to
net
the
little
profits
of
this
bargain
the
bergmanns
had
made
beautiful
gardens
round
their
house
and
had
built
a
hothouse
the
flowers
the
fruit
and
the
botanical
rarities
of
this
spot
were
what
had
induced
the
young
lady
to
settle
on
it
as
she
passed
through
gersau
miss
fanny
was
said
to
be
nineteen
years
old
she
was
the
old
man
s
youngest
child
and
the
object
of
his
adulation
about
two
months
ago
she
had
hired
a
piano
from
lucerne
for
she
seemed
to
be
crazy
about
music
she
loves
flowers
and
music
and
she
is
unmarried
thought
rodolphe
what
good
luck
the
next
day
rodolphe
went
to
ask
leave
to
visit
the
hothouses
and
gardens
which
were
beginning
to
be
somewhat
famous
the
permission
was
not
immediately
granted
the
retired
gardeners
asked
strangely
enough
to
see
rodolphe
s
passport
it
was
sent
to
them
at
once
the
paper
was
not
returned
to
him
till
next
morning
by
the
hands
of
the
cook
who
expressed
her
master
s
pleasure
in
showing
him
their
place
rodolphe
went
to
the
bergmanns
not
without
a
certain
trepidation
known
only
to
persons
of
strong
feelings
who
go
through
as
much
passion
in
a
moment
as
some
men
experience
in
a
whole
lifetime
after
dressing
himself
carefully
to
gratify
the
old
gardeners
of
the
borromean
islands
whom
he
regarded
as
the
warders
of
his
treasure
he
went
all
over
the
grounds
looking
at
the
house
now
and
again
but
with
much
caution
the
old
couple
treated
him
with
evident
distrust
but
his
attention
was
soon
attracted
by
the
little
english
in
whom
his
discernment
though
young
as
yet
enabled
him
to
recognize
a
girl
of
african
or
at
least
of
sicilian
origin
the
child
had
the
color
of
a
havana
cigar
eyes
of
fire
armenian
eyelids
with
lashes
of
very
length
hair
blacker
than
black
and
under
this
almost
olive
skin
sinews
of
extraordinary
strength
and
feverish
alertness
she
looked
at
rodolphe
with
amazing
curiosity
and
effrontery
watching
his
every
movement
to
whom
does
that
little
moresco
belong
he
asked
worthy
madame
bergmann
to
the
english
monsieur
bergmann
replied
but
she
never
was
born
in
england
they
may
have
brought
her
from
the
indies
said
madame
bergmann
i
have
been
told
that
miss
lovelace
is
fond
of
music
i
should
be
delighted
if
during
my
residence
by
the
lake
to
which
i
am
condemned
by
my
doctor
s
orders
she
would
allow
me
to
join
they
receive
no
one
and
will
not
see
anybody
said
the
old
gardener
rodolphe
bit
his
lips
and
went
away
without
having
been
invited
into
the
house
or
taken
into
the
part
of
the
garden
that
lay
between
the
front
of
the
house
and
the
shore
of
the
little
promontory
on
that
side
the
house
had
a
balcony
above
the
first
floor
made
of
wood
and
covered
by
the
roof
which
projected
deeply
like
the
roof
of
a
chalet
on
all
four
sides
of
the
building
in
the
swiss
fashion
rodolphe
had
loudly
praised
the
elegance
of
this
arrangement
and
talked
of
the
view
from
that
balcony
but
all
in
vain
when
he
had
taken
leave
of
the
bergmanns
it
struck
him
that
he
was
a
simpleton
like
any
man
of
spirit
and
imagination
disappointed
of
the
results
of
a
plan
which
he
had
believed
would
succeed
in
the
evening
he
of
course
went
out
in
a
boat
on
the
lake
round
and
about
the
spit
of
land
to
brunnen
and
to
schwytz
and
came
in
at
nightfall
from
afar
he
saw
the
window
open
and
brightly
lighted
he
heard
the
sound
of
a
piano
and
the
tones
of
an
exquisite
voice
he
made
the
boatman
stop
and
gave
himself
up
to
the
pleasure
of
listening
to
an
italian
air
delightfully
sung
when
the
singing
ceased
rodolphe
landed
and
sent
away
the
boat
and
rowers
at
the
cost
of
wetting
his
feet
he
went
to
sit
down
under
the
granite
shelf
crowned
by
a
thick
hedge
of
thorny
acacia
by
the
side
of
which
ran
a
long
lime
avenue
in
the
bergmanns
garden
by
the
end
of
an
hour
he
heard
steps
and
voices
just
above
him
but
the
words
that
reached
his
ears
were
all
italian
and
spoken
by
two
women
he
took
advantage
of
the
moment
when
the
two
speakers
were
at
one
end
of
the
walk
to
slip
noiselessly
to
the
other
after
half
an
hour
of
struggling
he
got
to
the
end
of
the
avenue
and
there
took
up
a
position
whence
without
being
seen
or
heard
he
could
watch
the
two
women
without
being
observed
by
them
as
they
came
towards
him
what
was
rodolphe
s
amazement
on
recognizing
the
as
one
of
them
she
was
talking
to
miss
lovelace
in
italian
it
was
now
eleven
o
clock
at
night
the
stillness
was
so
perfect
on
the
lake
and
around
the
dwelling
that
the
two
women
must
have
thought
themselves
safe
in
all
gersau
there
could
be
no
eyes
open
but
theirs
rodolphe
supposed
that
the
girl
s
dumbness
must
be
a
necessary
deception
from
the
way
in
which
they
both
spoke
italian
rodolphe
suspected
that
it
was
the
mother
tongue
of
both
girls
and
concluded
that
the
name
of
english
also
hid
some
disguise
they
are
italian
refugees
said
he
to
himself
outlaws
in
fear
of
the
austrian
or
sardinian
police
the
young
lady
waits
till
it
is
dark
to
walk
and
talk
in
he
lay
down
by
the
side
of
the
hedge
and
crawled
like
a
snake
to
find
a
way
between
two
acacia
shrubs
at
the
risk
of
leaving
his
coat
behind
him
or
tearing
deep
scratches
in
his
back
he
got
through
the
hedge
when
the
miss
fanny
and
her
pretended
maid
were
at
the
other
end
of
the
path
then
when
they
had
come
within
twenty
yards
of
him
without
seeing
him
for
he
was
in
the
shadow
of
the
hedge
and
the
moon
was
shining
brightly
he
suddenly
rose
fear
nothing
said
he
in
french
to
the
italian
girl
i
am
not
a
spy
you
are
refugees
i
have
guessed
that
i
am
a
frenchman
whom
one
look
from
you
has
fixed
at
rodolphe
startled
by
the
acute
pain
caused
by
some
steel
instrument
piercing
his
side
fell
like
a
log
lago
con
said
the
terrible
dumb
girl
oh
gina
exclaimed
the
italian
she
has
missed
me
said
rodolphe
pulling
from
his
wound
a
stiletto
which
had
been
turned
by
one
of
the
false
ribs
but
a
little
higher
up
it
would
have
been
deep
in
my
i
was
wrong
francesca
he
went
on
remembering
the
name
he
had
heard
little
gina
repeat
several
times
i
owe
her
no
grudge
do
not
scold
her
the
happiness
of
speaking
to
you
is
well
worth
the
prick
of
a
stiletto
only
show
me
the
way
out
i
must
get
back
to
the
stopfers
house
be
easy
i
shall
tell
francesca
recovering
from
her
astonishment
helped
rodolphe
to
rise
and
said
a
few
words
to
gina
whose
eyes
filled
with
tears
the
two
girls
made
him
sit
down
on
a
bench
and
take
off
his
coat
his
waistcoat
and
cravat
then
gina
opened
his
shirt
and
sucked
the
wound
strongly
francesca
who
had
left
them
returned
with
a
large
piece
of
which
she
applied
to
the
wound
you
can
now
walk
as
far
as
your
house
she
said
each
took
an
arm
and
rodolphe
was
conducted
to
a
side
gate
of
which
the
key
was
in
francesca
s
apron
pocket
does
gina
speak
french
said
rodolphe
to
francesca
no
but
do
not
excite
yourself
replied
francesca
with
some
impatience
let
me
look
at
you
said
rodolphe
pathetically
for
it
may
be
long
before
i
am
able
to
come
again
he
leaned
against
one
of
the
contemplating
the
beautiful
italian
who
allowed
him
to
gaze
at
her
for
a
moment
under
the
sweetest
silence
and
the
sweetest
night
which
ever
perhaps
shone
on
this
lake
the
king
of
swiss
lakes
francesca
was
quite
of
the
italian
type
and
such
as
imagination
supposes
or
pictures
or
if
you
will
dreams
that
italian
women
are
what
first
struck
rodolphe
was
the
grace
and
elegance
of
a
figure
evidently
powerful
though
so
slender
as
to
appear
fragile
an
amber
paleness
overspread
her
face
betraying
sudden
interest
but
it
did
not
dim
the
voluptuous
glance
of
her
liquid
eyes
of
velvety
blackness
a
pair
of
hands
as
beautiful
as
ever
a
greek
sculptor
added
to
the
polished
arms
of
a
statue
grasped
rodolphe
s
arm
and
their
whiteness
gleamed
against
his
black
coat
the
rash
frenchman
could
but
just
discern
the
long
oval
shape
of
her
face
and
a
melancholy
mouth
showing
brilliant
teeth
between
the
parted
lips
full
fresh
and
brightly
red
the
exquisite
lines
of
this
face
guaranteed
to
francesca
permanent
beauty
but
what
most
struck
rodolphe
was
the
adorable
freedom
the
italian
frankness
of
this
woman
wholly
absorbed
as
she
was
in
her
pity
for
him
francesca
said
a
word
to
gina
who
gave
rodolphe
her
arm
as
far
as
the
stopfers
door
and
fled
like
a
swallow
as
soon
as
she
had
rung
these
patriots
do
not
play
at
killing
said
rodolphe
to
himself
as
he
felt
his
sufferings
when
he
found
himself
in
his
bed
lago
gina
would
have
pitched
me
into
the
lake
with
a
stone
tied
to
my
next
day
he
sent
to
lucerne
for
the
best
surgeon
there
and
when
he
came
enjoined
on
him
absolute
secrecy
giving
him
to
understand
that
his
honor
depended
on
it
leopold
returned
from
his
excursion
on
the
day
when
his
friend
first
got
out
of
bed
rodolphe
made
up
a
story
and
begged
him
to
go
to
lucerne
to
fetch
their
luggage
and
letters
leopold
brought
back
the
most
fatal
the
most
dreadful
news
rodolphe
s
mother
was
dead
while
the
two
friends
were
on
their
way
from
bale
to
lucerne
the
fatal
letter
written
by
leopold
s
father
had
reached
lucerne
the
day
they
left
for
fluelen
in
spite
of
leopold
s
utmost
precautions
rodolphe
fell
ill
of
a
nervous
fever
as
soon
as
leopold
saw
his
friend
out
of
danger
he
set
out
for
france
with
a
power
of
attorney
and
rodolphe
could
thus
remain
at
gersau
the
only
place
in
the
world
where
his
grief
could
grow
calmer
the
young
frenchman
s
position
his
despair
the
circumstances
which
made
such
a
loss
worse
for
him
than
for
any
other
man
were
known
and
secured
him
the
pity
and
interest
of
every
one
in
gersau
every
morning
the
pretended
dumb
girl
came
to
see
him
and
bring
him
news
of
her
mistress
as
soon
as
rodolphe
could
go
out
he
went
to
the
bergmanns
house
to
thank
miss
fanny
lovelace
and
her
father
for
the
interest
they
had
taken
in
his
sorrow
and
his
illness
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
lodged
with
the
bergmanns
the
old
italian
admitted
a
stranger
to
his
room
where
rodolphe
was
received
with
the
cordiality
due
to
his
misfortunes
and
to
his
being
a
frenchman
which
excluded
all
distrust
of
him
francesca
looked
so
lovely
by
that
first
evening
that
she
shed
a
ray
of
brightness
on
his
grieving
heart
her
smiles
flung
the
roses
of
hope
on
his
woe
she
sang
not
indeed
gay
songs
but
grave
and
solemn
melodies
suited
to
the
state
of
rodolphe
s
heart
and
he
observed
this
touching
care
at
about
eight
o
clock
the
old
man
left
the
young
people
without
any
sign
of
uneasiness
and
went
to
his
room
when
francesca
was
tired
of
singing
she
led
rodolphe
on
to
the
balcony
whence
they
perceived
the
sublime
scenery
of
the
lake
and
signed
to
him
to
be
seated
by
her
on
a
rustic
wooden
bench
am
i
very
indiscreet
in
asking
how
old
you
are
cara
francesca
said
rodolphe
nineteen
said
she
well
if
anything
in
the
world
could
soothe
my
sorrow
he
went
on
it
would
be
the
hope
of
winning
you
from
your
father
whatever
your
fortune
may
be
so
beautiful
as
you
are
you
seem
to
be
richer
than
a
prince
s
daughter
and
i
tremble
as
i
confess
to
you
the
feelings
with
which
you
have
inspired
me
but
they
are
deep
they
are
said
francesca
laying
a
finger
of
her
right
hand
on
her
lips
say
no
more
i
am
not
free
i
have
been
married
these
three
for
a
few
minutes
utter
silence
reigned
when
the
italian
girl
alarmed
at
rodolphe
s
stillness
went
close
to
him
she
found
that
he
had
fainted
she
said
to
herself
and
i
thought
him
she
fetched
him
some
salts
and
revived
rodolphe
by
making
him
smell
at
them
married
said
rodolphe
looking
at
francesca
and
then
his
tears
flowed
freely
child
said
she
but
there
is
still
hope
my
husband
is
eighty
rodolphe
put
in
no
said
she
with
a
smile
but
he
has
disguised
himself
as
much
older
to
mislead
the
dearest
said
rodolphe
a
few
more
shocks
of
this
kind
and
i
shall
die
only
when
you
have
known
me
twenty
years
will
you
understand
the
strength
and
power
of
my
heart
and
the
nature
of
its
aspirations
for
happiness
this
plant
he
went
on
pointing
to
the
yellow
jasmine
which
covered
the
balustrade
does
not
climb
more
eagerly
to
spread
itself
in
the
sunbeams
than
i
have
clung
to
you
for
this
month
past
i
love
you
with
unique
passion
that
love
will
be
the
secret
fount
of
my
life
i
may
possibly
die
of
oh
frenchman
frenchman
said
she
emphasizing
her
exclamation
with
a
little
incredulous
grimace
shall
i
not
be
forced
to
wait
to
accept
you
at
the
hands
of
time
said
he
gravely
but
know
this
if
you
are
in
earnest
in
what
you
have
allowed
to
escape
you
i
will
wait
for
you
faithfully
without
suffering
any
other
attachment
to
grow
up
in
my
she
looked
at
him
doubtfully
none
said
he
not
even
a
passing
fancy
i
have
my
fortune
to
make
you
must
have
a
splendid
one
nature
created
you
a
princess
at
this
word
francesca
could
not
repress
a
faint
smile
which
gave
her
face
the
most
bewildering
expression
something
subtle
like
what
the
great
leonardo
has
so
well
depicted
in
the
this
smile
made
rodolphe
pause
ah
yes
he
went
on
you
must
suffer
much
from
the
destitution
to
which
exile
has
brought
you
oh
if
you
would
make
me
happy
above
all
men
and
consecrate
my
love
you
would
treat
me
as
a
friend
ought
i
not
to
be
your
friend
my
poor
mother
has
left
sixty
thousand
francs
of
savings
take
francesca
looked
steadily
at
him
this
piercing
gaze
went
to
the
bottom
of
rodolphe
s
soul
we
want
nothing
my
work
amply
supplies
our
luxuries
she
replied
in
a
grave
voice
and
can
i
endure
that
a
francesca
should
work
cried
he
one
day
you
will
return
to
your
country
and
find
all
you
left
again
the
italian
girl
looked
at
rodolphe
and
you
will
then
repay
me
what
you
may
have
condescended
to
borrow
he
added
with
an
expression
full
of
delicate
feeling
let
us
drop
the
subject
said
she
with
incomparable
dignity
of
gesture
expression
and
attitude
make
a
splendid
fortune
be
one
of
the
remarkable
men
of
your
country
that
is
my
desire
fame
is
a
drawbridge
which
may
serve
to
cross
a
deep
gulf
be
ambitious
if
you
must
i
believe
you
have
great
and
powerful
talents
but
use
them
rather
for
the
happiness
of
mankind
than
to
deserve
me
you
will
be
all
the
greater
in
my
in
the
course
of
this
conversation
which
lasted
two
hours
rodolphe
discovered
that
francesca
was
an
enthusiast
for
liberal
ideas
and
for
that
worship
of
liberty
which
had
led
to
the
three
revolutions
in
naples
piemont
and
spain
on
leaving
he
was
shown
to
the
door
by
gina
the
mute
at
eleven
o
clock
no
one
was
astir
in
the
village
there
was
no
fear
of
listeners
rodolphe
took
gina
into
a
corner
and
asked
her
in
a
low
voice
and
bad
italian
who
are
your
master
and
mistress
child
tell
me
i
will
give
you
this
fine
new
gold
monsieur
said
the
girl
taking
the
coin
my
master
is
the
famous
bookseller
lamporani
of
milan
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
revolution
and
the
conspirator
of
all
others
whom
austria
would
most
like
to
have
in
the
a
bookseller
s
wife
ah
so
much
the
better
thought
he
we
are
on
an
equal
and
what
is
her
family
he
added
for
she
looks
like
a
all
italian
women
do
replied
gina
proudly
her
father
s
name
is
emboldened
by
francesca
s
modest
rank
rodolphe
had
an
awning
fitted
to
his
boat
and
cushions
in
the
stern
when
this
was
done
the
lover
came
to
propose
to
francesca
to
come
out
on
the
lake
the
italian
accepted
no
doubt
to
carry
out
her
part
of
a
young
english
miss
in
the
eyes
of
the
villagers
but
she
brought
gina
with
her
francesca
colonna
s
lightest
actions
betrayed
a
superior
education
and
the
highest
social
rank
by
the
way
in
which
she
took
her
place
at
the
end
of
the
boat
rodolphe
felt
himself
in
some
sort
cut
off
from
her
and
in
the
face
of
a
look
of
pride
worthy
of
an
aristocrat
the
familiarity
he
had
intended
fell
dead
by
a
glance
francesca
made
herself
a
princess
with
all
the
prerogatives
she
might
have
enjoyed
in
the
middle
ages
she
seemed
to
have
read
the
thoughts
of
this
vassal
who
was
so
audacious
as
to
constitute
himself
her
protector
already
in
the
furniture
of
the
room
where
francesca
had
received
him
in
her
dress
and
in
the
various
trifles
she
made
use
of
rodolphe
had
detected
indications
of
a
superior
character
and
a
fine
fortune
all
these
observations
now
recurred
to
his
mind
he
became
thoughtful
after
having
been
trampled
on
as
it
were
by
francesca
s
dignity
gina
her
also
seemed
to
have
a
mocking
expression
as
she
gave
a
covert
or
a
side
glance
at
rodolphe
this
obvious
disagreement
between
the
italian
lady
s
rank
and
her
manners
was
a
fresh
puzzle
to
rodolphe
who
suspected
some
further
trick
like
gina
s
assumed
dumbness
where
would
you
go
signora
lamporani
he
asked
towards
lucerne
replied
francesca
in
french
good
said
rodolphe
to
himself
she
is
not
startled
by
hearing
me
speak
her
name
she
had
no
doubt
foreseen
that
i
should
ask
gina
she
is
so
what
is
your
quarrel
with
me
he
went
on
going
at
last
to
sit
down
by
her
side
and
asking
her
by
a
gesture
to
give
him
her
hand
which
she
withdrew
you
are
cold
and
ceremonious
what
in
colloquial
language
we
should
call
it
is
true
she
replied
with
a
smile
i
am
wrong
it
is
not
good
manners
it
is
vulgar
in
french
you
would
call
it
inartistic
it
is
better
to
be
frank
than
to
harbor
cold
or
hostile
feelings
towards
a
friend
and
you
have
already
proved
yourself
my
friend
perhaps
i
have
gone
too
far
with
you
you
must
take
me
to
be
a
very
ordinary
rodolphe
made
many
signs
of
yes
said
the
bookseller
s
wife
going
on
without
noticing
this
pantomime
which
however
she
plainly
saw
i
have
detected
that
and
naturally
i
have
reconsidered
my
conduct
well
i
will
put
an
end
to
everything
by
a
few
words
of
deep
truth
understand
this
rodolphe
i
feel
in
myself
the
strength
to
stifle
a
feeling
if
it
were
not
in
harmony
with
my
ideas
or
anticipation
of
what
true
love
is
i
could
love
as
we
can
love
in
italy
but
i
know
my
duty
no
intoxication
can
make
me
forget
it
married
without
my
consent
to
that
poor
old
man
i
might
take
advantage
of
the
liberty
he
so
generously
gives
me
but
three
years
of
married
life
imply
acceptance
of
its
laws
hence
the
most
vehement
passion
would
never
make
me
utter
even
involuntarily
a
wish
to
find
myself
free
emilio
knows
my
character
he
knows
that
without
my
heart
which
is
my
own
and
which
i
might
give
away
i
should
never
allow
anyone
to
take
my
hand
that
is
why
i
have
just
refused
it
to
you
i
desire
to
be
loved
and
waited
for
with
fidelity
nobleness
ardor
while
all
i
can
give
is
infinite
tenderness
of
which
the
expression
may
not
overstep
the
boundary
of
the
heart
the
permitted
neutral
ground
all
this
being
thoroughly
understood
oh
she
went
on
with
a
girlish
gesture
i
will
be
as
coquettish
as
gay
as
glad
as
a
child
which
knows
nothing
of
the
dangers
of
this
plain
and
frank
declaration
was
made
in
a
tone
an
accent
and
supported
by
a
look
which
gave
it
the
deepest
stamp
of
truth
a
princess
colonna
could
not
have
spoken
better
said
rodolphe
smiling
is
that
she
answered
with
some
haughtiness
a
reflection
on
the
humbleness
of
my
birth
must
your
love
flaunt
a
at
milan
the
noblest
names
are
written
over
sforza
canova
visconti
trivulzio
ursini
there
are
archintos
apothecaries
but
believe
me
though
i
keep
a
shop
i
have
the
feelings
of
a
a
reflection
nay
madame
i
meant
it
for
by
a
comparison
she
said
archly
ah
once
for
all
said
he
not
to
torture
me
if
my
words
should
ill
express
my
feelings
understand
that
my
love
is
perfect
it
carries
with
it
absolute
obedience
and
she
bowed
as
a
woman
satisfied
and
said
then
monsieur
accepts
the
treaty
yes
said
he
i
can
understand
that
in
a
rich
and
powerful
feminine
nature
the
faculty
of
loving
ought
not
to
be
wasted
and
that
you
out
of
delicacy
wished
to
restrain
it
ah
francesca
at
my
age
tenderness
requited
and
by
so
sublime
so
royally
beautiful
a
creature
as
you
are
why
it
is
the
fulfilment
of
all
my
wishes
to
love
you
as
you
desire
to
be
loved
is
not
that
enough
to
make
a
young
man
guard
himself
against
every
evil
folly
is
it
not
to
concentrate
all
his
powers
in
a
noble
passion
of
which
in
the
future
he
may
be
proud
and
which
can
leave
none
but
lovely
memories
if
you
could
but
know
with
what
hues
you
have
clothed
the
chain
of
pilatus
the
rigi
and
this
superb
lake
i
want
to
know
said
she
with
the
italian
artlessness
which
has
always
a
touch
of
artfulness
well
this
hour
will
shine
on
all
my
life
like
a
diamond
on
a
queen
s
francesca
s
only
reply
was
to
lay
her
hand
on
rodolphe
s
oh
dearest
for
ever
dearest
tell
me
have
you
never
loved
and
you
allow
me
to
love
you
nobly
looking
to
heaven
for
the
utmost
fulfilment
he
asked
she
gently
bent
her
head
two
large
tears
rolled
down
rodolphe
s
cheeks
why
what
is
the
matter
she
cried
abandoning
her
imperial
manner
i
have
now
no
mother
whom
i
can
tell
of
my
happiness
she
left
this
earth
without
seeing
what
would
have
mitigated
her
agony
what
said
she
her
tenderness
replaced
by
an
equal
tenderness
exclaimed
the
italian
much
touched
believe
me
she
went
on
after
a
pause
it
is
a
very
sweet
thing
and
to
a
woman
a
strong
element
of
fidelity
to
know
that
she
is
all
in
all
on
earth
to
the
man
she
loves
to
find
him
lonely
with
no
family
with
nothing
in
his
heart
but
his
love
in
short
to
have
him
wholly
to
when
two
lovers
thus
understand
each
other
the
heart
feels
delicious
peace
supreme
tranquillity
certainty
is
the
basis
for
which
human
feelings
crave
for
it
is
never
lacking
to
religious
sentiment
man
is
always
certain
of
being
fully
repaid
by
god
love
never
believes
itself
secure
but
by
this
resemblance
to
divine
love
and
the
raptures
of
that
moment
must
have
been
fully
felt
to
be
understood
it
is
unique
in
life
it
can
never
return
no
more
alas
than
the
emotions
of
youth
to
believe
in
a
woman
to
make
her
your
human
religion
the
fount
of
life
the
secret
luminary
of
all
your
least
thoughts
is
not
this
a
second
birth
and
a
young
man
mingles
with
this
love
a
little
of
the
feeling
he
had
for
his
mother
rodolphe
and
francesca
for
some
time
remained
in
perfect
silence
answering
each
other
by
sympathetic
glances
full
of
thoughts
they
understood
each
other
in
the
midst
of
one
of
the
most
beautiful
scenes
of
nature
whose
glories
interpreted
by
the
glory
in
their
hearts
helped
to
stamp
on
their
minds
the
most
fugitive
details
of
that
unique
hour
there
had
not
been
the
slightest
shade
of
frivolity
in
francesca
s
conduct
it
was
noble
large
and
without
any
second
thought
this
magnanimity
struck
rodolphe
greatly
for
in
it
he
recognized
the
difference
between
the
italian
and
the
frenchwoman
the
waters
the
land
the
sky
the
woman
all
were
grandiose
and
suave
even
their
love
in
the
midst
of
this
picture
so
vast
in
its
expanse
so
rich
in
detail
where
the
sternness
of
the
snowy
peaks
and
their
hard
folds
standing
clearly
out
against
the
blue
sky
reminded
rodolphe
of
the
circumstances
which
limited
his
happiness
a
lovely
country
shut
in
by
snows
this
delightful
intoxication
of
soul
was
destined
to
be
disturbed
a
boat
was
approaching
from
lucerne
gina
who
had
been
watching
it
attentively
gave
a
joyful
start
though
faithful
to
her
part
as
a
mute
the
bark
came
nearer
when
at
length
francesca
could
distinguish
the
faces
on
board
she
exclaimed
tito
as
she
perceived
a
young
man
she
stood
up
and
remained
standing
at
the
risk
of
being
drowned
tito
tito
cried
she
waving
her
handkerchief
tito
desired
the
boatmen
to
slacken
and
the
two
boats
pulled
side
by
side
the
italian
and
tito
talked
with
such
extreme
rapidity
and
in
a
dialect
unfamiliar
to
a
man
who
hardly
knew
even
the
italian
of
books
that
rodolphe
could
neither
hear
nor
guess
the
drift
of
this
conversation
but
tito
s
handsome
face
francesca
s
familiarity
and
gina
s
expression
of
delight
all
aggrieved
him
and
indeed
no
lover
can
help
being
ill
pleased
at
finding
himself
neglected
for
another
whoever
he
may
be
tito
tossed
a
little
leather
bag
to
gina
full
of
gold
no
doubt
and
a
packet
of
letters
to
francesca
who
began
to
read
them
with
a
farewell
wave
of
the
hand
to
tito
get
quickly
back
to
gersau
she
said
to
the
boatmen
i
will
not
let
my
poor
emilio
pine
ten
minutes
longer
than
he
what
has
happened
asked
rodolphe
as
he
saw
francesca
finish
reading
the
last
letter
she
exclaimed
with
an
artist
s
enthusiasm
added
gina
like
an
echo
for
she
had
found
her
tongue
yes
said
francesca
no
more
poverty
for
more
than
eleven
months
have
i
been
working
and
i
was
beginning
to
be
tired
of
it
i
am
certainly
not
a
literary
who
is
this
tito
asked
rodolphe
the
secretary
of
state
to

words
the

of
our
poor
boy

could
not
come

by
the
nor
by
the
simplon
he
came

by
marseilles

had
to

rodolphe
she
added
seeing
sadness
overspread
the
parisian
s
face
is
not
the
lake
of
geneva
quite
as
good
as
the
lake
of
lucerne
but
allow
me
to
bestow
a
regret
on
the
bergmanns
delightful
house
said
rodolphe
pointing
to
the
little
promontory
come
and
dine
with
us
to
add
to
your
associations
said
she
this
is
a
great
day
we
are
out
of
danger
my
mother
writes
that
within
a
year
there
will
be
an
amnesty
oh
cara
these
three
words
made
gina
weep
another
winter
here
said
she
and
i
should
have
been
dead
poor
little
sicilian
kid
said
francesca
stroking
gina
s
head
with
an
expression
and
an
affection
which
made
rodolphe
long
to
be
so
caressed
even
if
it
were
without
love
the
boat
grounded
rodolphe
sprang
on
to
the
sand
offered
his
hand
to
the
italian
lady
escorted
her
to
the
door
of
the
bergmanns
house
and
went
to
dress
and
return
as
soon
as
possible
when
he
joined
the
librarian
and
his
wife
who
were
sitting
on
the
balcony
rodolphe
could
scarcely
repress
an
exclamation
of
surprise
at
seeing
the
prodigious
change
which
the
good
news
had
produced
in
the
old
man
he
now
saw
a
man
of
about
sixty
extremely
well
preserved
a
lean
italian
as
straight
as
an
i
with
hair
still
black
though
thin
and
showing
a
white
skull
with
bright
eyes
a
full
set
of
white
teeth
a
face
like
caesar
and
on
his
diplomatic
lips
a
sardonic
smile
the
almost
false
smile
under
which
a
man
of
good
breeding
hides
his
real
feelings
here
is
my
husband
under
his
natural
form
said
francesca
gravely
he
is
quite
a
new
acquaintance
replied
rodolphe
bewildered
quite
said
the
librarian
i
have
played
many
a
part
and
know
well
how
to
make
up
ah
i
played
one
in
paris
under
the
empire
with
bourrienne
madame
murat
madame
d
abrantis
tutte
everything
we
take
the
trouble
to
learn
in
our
youth
even
the
most
futile
is
of
use
if
my
wife
had
not
received
a
man
s
education
an
thing
in
italy
i
should
have
been
obliged
to
chop
wood
to
get
my
living
here
francesca
who
would
have
told
me
that
she
would
some
day
maintain
me
as
he
listened
to
this
worthy
bookseller
so
easy
so
affable
so
hale
rodolphe
scented
some
mystification
and
preserved
the
watchful
silence
of
a
man
who
has
been
duped
avete
francesca
asked
with
simplicity
does
our
happiness
sadden
you
your
husband
is
a
young
man
he
whispered
in
her
ear
she
broke
into
such
a
frank
infectious
laugh
that
rodolphe
was
still
more
puzzled
he
is
but
at
your
service
said
she
but
i
can
assure
you
that
even
that
is
something
to
be
thankful
for
i
do
not
like
to
hear
you
jest
about
an
affection
so
sacred
as
this
of
which
you
yourself
prescribed
the
said
she
stamping
her
foot
and
looking
whether
her
husband
were
listening
never
disturb
the
peace
of
mind
of
that
dear
man
as
simple
as
a
child
and
with
whom
i
can
do
what
i
please
he
is
under
my
protection
she
added
if
you
could
know
with
what
generosity
he
risked
his
life
and
fortune
because
i
was
a
liberal
for
he
does
not
share
my
political
opinions
is
not
that
love
monsieur
frenchman
but
they
are
like
that
in
his
family
emilio
s
younger
brother
was
deserted
for
a
handsome
youth
by
the
woman
he
loved
he
thrust
his
sword
through
his
own
heart
ten
minutes
after
he
had
said
to
his
servant
i
could
of
course
kill
my
rival
but
that
would
grieve
the
too
this
mixture
of
dignity
and
banter
of
haughtiness
and
playfulness
made
francesca
at
this
moment
the
most
fascinating
creature
in
the
world
the
dinner
and
the
evening
were
full
of
cheerfulness
justified
indeed
by
the
relief
of
the
two
refugees
but
depressing
to
rodolphe
can
she
be
fickle
he
asked
himself
as
he
returned
to
the
stopfers
house
she
sympathized
in
my
sorrow
and
i
can
not
take
part
in
her
joy
he
blamed
himself
justifying
this
she
has
no
taint
of
hypocrisy
and
is
carried
away
by
impulse
thought
he
and
i
want
her
to
be
like
a
parisian
next
day
and
the
following
days
in
fact
for
twenty
days
after
rodolphe
spent
all
his
time
at
the
bergmanns
watching
francesca
without
having
determined
to
watch
her
in
some
souls
admiration
is
not
independent
of
a
certain
penetration
the
young
frenchman
discerned
in
francesca
the
imprudence
of
girlhood
the
true
nature
of
a
woman
as
yet
unbroken
sometimes
struggling
against
her
love
and
at
other
moments
yielding
and
carried
away
by
it
the
old
man
certainly
behaved
to
her
as
a
father
to
his
daughter
and
francesca
treated
him
with
a
deeply
felt
gratitude
which
roused
her
instinctive
nobleness
the
situation
and
the
woman
were
to
rodolphe
an
impenetrable
enigma
of
which
the
solution
attracted
him
more
and
more
these
last
days
were
full
of
secret
joys
alternating
with
melancholy
moods
with
tiffs
and
quarrels
even
more
delightful
than
the
hours
when
rodolphe
and
francesca
were
of
one
mind
and
he
was
more
and
more
fascinated
by
this
tenderness
apart
from
wit
always
and
in
all
things
the
same
an
affection
that
was
jealous
of
mere
nothings
already
you
care
very
much
for
luxury
said
he
one
evening
to
francesca
who
was
expressing
her
wish
to
get
away
from
gersau
where
she
missed
many
things
i
cried
she
i
love
luxury
as
i
love
the
arts
as
i
love
a
picture
by
raphael
a
fine
horse
a
beautiful
day
or
the
bay
of
naples
emilio
she
went
on
have
i
ever
complained
here
during
our
days
of
you
would
not
have
been
yourself
if
you
had
replied
the
old
man
gravely
after
all
is
it
not
in
the
nature
of
plain
folks
to
aspire
to
grandeur
she
asked
with
a
mischievous
glance
at
rodolphe
and
at
her
husband
were
my
feet
made
for
fatigue
she
added
putting
out
two
pretty
little
feet
my
hands
and
she
held
one
out
to
rodolphe
were
those
hands
made
to
work
leave
us
she
said
to
her
husband
i
want
to
speak
to
the
old
man
went
into
the
with
sublime
good
faith
he
was
sure
of
his
wife
i
will
not
have
you
come
with
us
to
geneva
she
said
to
rodolphe
it
is
a
gossiping
town
though
i
am
far
above
the
nonsense
the
world
talks
i
do
not
choose
to
be
calumniated
not
for
my
own
sake
but
for
his
i
make
it
my
pride
to
be
the
glory
of
that
old
man
who
is
after
all
my
only
protector
we
are
leaving
stay
here
a
few
days
when
you
come
on
to
geneva
call
first
on
my
husband
and
let
him
introduce
you
to
me
let
us
hide
our
great
and
unchangeable
affection
from
the
eyes
of
the
world
i
love
you
you
know
it
but
this
is
how
i
will
prove
it
to
you
you
shall
never
discern
in
my
conduct
anything
whatever
that
may
arouse
your
she
drew
him
into
a
corner
of
the
balcony
kissed
him
on
the
forehead
and
fled
leaving
him
in
amazement
next
day
rodolphe
heard
that
the
lodgers
at
the
bergmanns
had
left
at
daybreak
it
then
seemed
to
him
intolerable
to
remain
at
gersau
and
he
set
out
for
vevay
by
the
longest
route
starting
sooner
than
was
necessary
attracted
to
the
waters
of
the
lake
where
the
beautiful
italian
awaited
him
he
reached
geneva
by
the
end
of
october
to
avoid
the
discomforts
of
the
town
he
took
rooms
in
a
house
at
outside
the
walls
as
soon
as
he
was
settled
his
first
care
was
to
ask
his
landlord
a
retired
jeweler
whether
some
italian
refugees
from
milan
had
not
lately
come
to
reside
at
geneva
not
so
far
as
i
know
replied
the
man
prince
and
princess
colonna
of
rome
have
taken
monsieur
jeanrenaud
s
place
for
three
years
it
is
one
of
the
finest
on
the
lake
it
is
situated
between
the
villa
diodati
and
that
of
monsieur
let
to
the
vicomtesse
de
beauseant
prince
colonna
has
come
to
see
his
daughter
and
his
prince
gandolphini
a
neopolitan
or
if
you
like
a
sicilian
an
old
adherent
of
king
murat
s
and
a
victim
of
the
last
revolution
these
are
the
last
arrivals
at
geneva
and
they
are
not
milanese
serious
steps
had
to
be
taken
and
the
pope
s
interest
in
the
colonna
family
was
invoked
to
obtain
permission
from
the
foreign
powers
and
the
king
of
naples
for
the
prince
and
princess
gandolphini
to
live
here
geneva
is
anxious
to
do
nothing
to
displease
the
holy
alliance
to
which
it
owes
its
independence
part
is
not
to
ruffle
foreign
courts
there
are
many
foreigners
here
russians
and
even
some
gevenese
yes
monsieur
our
lake
is
so
fine
lord
byron
lived
here
about
seven
years
at
the
villa
diodati
which
every
one
goes
to
see
now
like
coppet
and
you
can
not
tell
me
whether
within
a
week
or
so
a
bookseller
from
milan
has
come
with
his
wife
named
lamporani
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
last
revolution
i
could
easily
find
out
by
going
to
the
foreigners
club
said
the
jeweler
rodolphe
s
first
walk
was
very
naturally
to
the
villa
diodati
the
residence
of
lord
byron
whose
recent
death
added
to
its
attractiveness
for
is
not
death
the
consecration
of
genius
the
road
to
follows
the
shore
of
the
lake
and
like
all
the
roads
in
switzerland
is
very
narrow
in
some
spots
in
consequence
of
the
configuration
of
the
hilly
ground
there
is
scarcely
space
for
two
carriages
to
pass
each
other
at
a
few
yards
from
the
jeanrenauds
house
which
he
was
approaching
without
knowing
it
rodolphe
heard
the
sound
of
a
carriage
behind
him
and
finding
himself
in
a
sunk
road
he
climbed
to
the
top
of
a
rock
to
leave
the
road
free
of
course
he
looked
at
the
approaching
carriage
an
elegant
english
phaeton
with
a
splendid
pair
of
english
horses
he
felt
quite
dizzy
as
he
beheld
in
this
carriage
francesca
beautifully
dressed
by
the
side
of
an
old
lady
as
hard
as
a
cameo
a
servant
blazing
with
gold
lace
stood
behind
francesca
recognized
rodolphe
and
smiled
at
seeing
him
like
a
statue
on
a
pedestal
the
carriage
which
the
lover
followed
with
his
eyes
as
he
climbed
the
hill
turned
in
at
the
gate
of
a
country
house
towards
which
he
ran
who
lives
here
he
asked
the
gardener
prince
and
princess
colonna
and
prince
and
princess
have
they
not
just
driven
in
yes
in
that
instant
a
veil
fell
from
rodolphe
s
eyes
he
saw
clearly
the
meaning
of
the
past
if
only
this
is
her
last
piece
of
trickery
thought
the
lover
to
himself
he
trembled
lest
he
should
have
been
the
plaything
of
a
whim
for
he
had
heard
what
a
might
mean
in
an
italian
but
what
a
crime
had
he
committed
in
the
eyes
of
a
woman
in
accepting
a
born
princess
as
a
citizen
s
wife
in
believing
that
a
daughter
of
one
of
the
most
illustrious
houses
of
the
middle
ages
was
the
wife
of
a
bookseller
the
consciousness
of
his
blunders
increased
rodolphe
s
desire
to
know
whether
he
would
be
ignored
and
repelled
he
asked
for
prince
gandolphini
sending
in
his
card
and
was
immediately
received
by
the
false
lamporani
who
came
forward
to
meet
him
welcomed
him
with
the
best
possible
grace
and
took
him
to
walk
on
a
terrace
whence
there
was
a
view
of
geneva
the
jura
the
hills
covered
with
villas
and
below
them
a
wide
expanse
of
the
lake
my
wife
is
faithful
to
the
lakes
you
see
he
remarked
after
pointing
out
the
details
to
his
visitor
we
have
a
sort
of
concert
this
evening
he
added
as
they
returned
to
the
splendid
villa
jeanrenaud
i
hope
you
will
do
me
and
the
princess
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
two
months
of
poverty
endured
in
intimacy
are
equal
to
years
of
though
he
was
consumed
by
curiosity
rodolphe
dared
not
ask
to
see
the
princess
he
slowly
made
his
way
back
to
looking
forward
to
the
evening
in
a
few
hours
his
passion
great
as
it
had
already
been
was
augmented
by
his
anxiety
and
by
suspense
as
to
future
events
he
now
understood
the
necessity
for
making
himself
famous
that
he
might
some
day
find
himself
socially
speaking
on
a
level
with
his
idol
in
his
eyes
francesca
was
made
really
great
by
the
simplicity
and
ease
of
her
conduct
at
gersau
princess
colonna
s
haughtiness
so
evidently
natural
to
her
alarmed
rodolphe
who
would
find
enemies
in
francesca
s
father
and
mother
at
least
so
he
might
expect
and
the
secrecy
which
princess
gandolphini
had
so
strictly
enjoined
on
him
now
struck
him
as
a
wonderful
proof
of
affection
by
not
choosing
to
compromise
the
future
had
she
not
confessed
that
she
loved
him
at
last
nine
o
clock
struck
rodolphe
could
get
into
a
carriage
and
say
with
an
emotion
that
is
very
intelligible
to
the
villa
jeanrenaud
to
prince
gandolphini
at
last
he
saw
francesca
but
without
being
seen
by
her
the
princess
was
standing
quite
near
the
piano
her
beautiful
hair
so
thick
and
long
was
bound
with
a
golden
fillet
her
face
in
the
light
of
wax
candles
had
the
brilliant
pallor
peculiar
to
italians
and
which
looks
its
best
only
by
artificial
light
she
was
in
full
evening
dress
showing
her
fascinating
shoulders
the
figure
of
a
girl
and
the
arms
of
an
antique
statue
her
sublime
beauty
was
beyond
all
possible
rivalry
though
there
were
some
charming
women
of
geneva
and
other
italians
among
them
the
dazzling
and
illustrious
princess
varese
and
the
famous
singer
tinti
who
was
at
that
moment
singing
rodolphe
leaning
against
the
looked
at
the
princess
turning
on
her
the
fixed
tenacious
attracting
gaze
charged
with
the
full
insistent
will
which
is
concentrated
in
the
feeling
called
desire
and
thus
assumes
the
nature
of
a
vehement
command
did
the
flame
of
that
gaze
reach
francesca
was
francesca
expecting
each
instant
to
see
rodolphe
in
a
few
minutes
she
stole
a
glance
at
the
door
as
though
magnetized
by
this
current
of
love
and
her
eyes
without
reserve
looked
deep
into
rodolphe
s
a
slight
thrill
quivered
through
that
superb
face
and
beautiful
body
the
shock
to
her
spirit
reacted
francesca
blushed
rodolphe
felt
a
whole
life
in
this
exchange
of
looks
so
swift
that
it
can
only
be
compared
to
a
lightning
flash
but
to
what
could
his
happiness
compare
he
was
loved
the
lofty
princess
in
the
midst
of
her
world
in
this
handsome
villa
kept
the
pledge
given
by
the
disguised
exile
the
capricious
beauty
of
bergmanns
lodgings
the
intoxication
of
such
a
moment
enslaves
a
man
for
life
a
faint
smile
refined
and
subtle
candid
and
triumphant
curled
princess
gandolphini
s
lips
and
at
a
moment
when
she
did
not
feel
herself
observed
she
looked
at
rodolphe
with
an
expression
which
seemed
to
ask
his
pardon
for
having
deceived
him
as
to
her
rank
when
the
song
was
ended
rodolphe
could
make
his
way
to
the
prince
who
graciously
led
him
to
his
wife
rodolphe
went
through
the
ceremonial
of
a
formal
introduction
to
princess
and
prince
colonna
and
to
francesca
when
this
was
over
the
princess
had
to
take
part
in
the
famous
quartette
manca
la
which
was
sung
by
her
with
tinti
with
the
famous
tenor
genovese
and
with
a
italian
prince
then
in
exile
whose
voice
if
he
had
not
been
a
prince
would
have
made
him
one
of
the
princes
of
art
take
that
seat
said
francesca
to
rodolphe
pointing
to
her
own
chair
i
think
there
is
some
mistake
in
my
name
i
have
for
the
last
minute
been
princess
it
was
said
with
the
artless
grace
which
revived
in
this
avowal
hidden
beneath
a
jest
the
happy
days
at
gersau
rodolphe
reveled
in
the
exquisite
sensation
of
listening
to
the
voice
of
the
woman
he
adored
while
sitting
so
close
to
her
that
one
cheek
was
almost
touched
by
the
stuff
of
her
dress
and
the
gauze
of
her
scarf
but
when
at
such
a
moment
manca
la
is
being
sung
and
by
the
finest
voices
in
italy
it
is
easy
to
understand
what
it
was
that
brought
the
tears
to
rodolphe
s
eyes
in
love
as
perhaps
in
all
else
there
are
certain
circumstances
trivial
in
themselves
but
the
outcome
of
a
thousand
little
previous
incidents
of
which
the
importance
is
immense
as
an
epitome
of
the
past
and
as
a
link
with
the
future
a
hundred
times
already
we
have
felt
the
preciousness
of
the
one
we
love
but
a
trifle
the
perfect
touch
of
two
souls
united
during
a
walk
perhaps
by
a
single
word
by
some
proof
of
affection
will
carry
the
feeling
to
its
supremest
pitch
in
short
to
express
this
truth
by
an
image
which
has
been
successful
from
the
earliest
ages
of
the
world
there
are
in
a
long
chain
points
of
attachment
needed
where
the
cohesion
is
stronger
than
in
the
intermediate
loops
of
rings
this
recognition
between
rodolphe
and
francesca
at
this
party
in
the
face
of
the
world
was
one
of
those
intense
moments
which
join
the
future
to
the
past
and
rivet
a
real
attachment
more
deeply
in
the
heart
it
was
perhaps
of
these
incidental
rivets
that
bossuet
spoke
when
he
compared
to
them
the
rarity
of
happy
moments
in
our
lives
he
who
had
such
a
living
and
secret
experience
of
love
next
to
the
pleasure
of
admiring
the
woman
we
love
comes
that
of
seeing
her
admired
by
every
one
else
rodolphe
was
enjoying
both
at
once
love
is
a
treasury
of
memories
and
though
rodolphe
s
was
already
full
he
added
to
it
pearls
of
great
price
smiles
shed
aside
for
him
alone
stolen
glances
tones
in
her
singing
which
francesca
addressed
to
him
alone
but
which
made
tinti
pale
with
jealousy
they
were
so
much
applauded
all
his
strength
of
desire
the
special
expression
of
his
soul
was
thrown
over
the
beautiful
roman
who
became
unchangeably
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
all
his
thoughts
and
actions
rodolphe
loved
as
every
woman
may
dream
of
being
loved
with
a
force
a
constancy
a
tenacity
which
made
francesca
the
very
substance
of
his
heart
he
felt
her
mingling
with
his
blood
as
purer
blood
with
his
soul
as
a
more
perfect
soul
she
would
henceforth
underlie
the
least
efforts
of
his
life
as
the
golden
sand
of
the
mediterranean
lies
beneath
the
waves
in
short
rodolphe
s
lightest
aspiration
was
now
a
living
hope
at
the
end
of
a
few
days
francesca
understood
this
boundless
love
but
it
was
so
natural
and
so
perfectly
shared
by
her
that
it
did
not
surprise
her
she
was
worthy
of
it
what
is
there
that
is
strange
said
she
to
rodolphe
as
they
walked
on
the
garden
terrace
when
he
had
been
betrayed
into
one
of
those
outbursts
of
conceit
which
come
so
naturally
to
frenchmen
in
the
expression
of
their
feelings
what
is
extraordinary
in
the
fact
of
your
loving
a
young
and
beautiful
woman
artist
enough
to
be
able
to
earn
her
living
like
tinti
and
of
giving
you
some
of
the
pleasures
of
vanity
what
lout
but
would
then
become
an
amadis
this
is
not
in
question
between
you
and
me
what
is
needed
is
that
we
both
love
faithfully
persistently
at
a
distance
from
each
other
for
years
with
no
satisfaction
but
that
of
knowing
that
we
are
alas
said
rodolphe
will
you
not
consider
my
fidelity
as
devoid
of
all
merit
when
you
see
me
absorbed
in
the
efforts
of
devouring
ambition
do
you
imagine
that
i
can
wish
to
see
you
one
day
exchange
the
fine
name
of
gandolphini
for
that
of
a
man
who
is
a
nobody
i
want
to
become
one
of
the
most
remarkable
men
of
my
country
to
be
rich
great
that
you
may
be
as
proud
of
my
name
as
of
your
own
name
of
i
should
be
grieved
to
see
you
without
such
sentiments
in
your
heart
she
replied
with
a
bewitching
smile
but
do
not
wear
yourself
out
too
soon
in
your
ambitious
labors
remain
young
they
say
that
politics
soon
make
a
man
one
of
the
rarest
gifts
in
women
is
a
certain
gaiety
which
does
not
detract
from
tenderness
this
combination
of
deep
feeling
with
the
lightness
of
youth
added
an
enchanting
grace
at
this
moment
to
francesca
s
charms
this
is
the
key
to
her
character
she
laughs
and
she
is
touched
she
becomes
enthusiastic
and
returns
to
arch
raillery
with
a
readiness
a
facility
which
makes
her
the
charming
and
exquisite
creature
she
is
and
for
which
her
reputation
is
known
outside
italy
under
the
graces
of
a
woman
she
conceals
vast
learning
thanks
to
the
excessively
monotonous
and
almost
monastic
life
she
led
in
the
castle
of
the
old
colonnas
this
rich
heiress
was
at
first
intended
for
the
cloister
being
the
fourth
child
of
prince
and
princess
colonna
but
the
death
of
her
two
brothers
and
of
her
elder
sister
suddenly
brought
her
out
of
her
retirement
and
made
her
one
of
the
most
brilliant
matches
in
the
papal
states
her
elder
sister
had
been
betrothed
to
prince
gandolphini
one
of
the
richest
landowners
in
sicily
and
francesca
was
married
to
him
instead
so
that
nothing
might
be
changed
in
the
position
of
the
family
the
colonnas
and
gandolphinis
had
always
intermarried
from
the
age
of
nine
till
she
was
sixteen
francesca
under
the
direction
of
a
cardinal
of
the
family
had
read
all
through
the
library
of
the
colonnas
to
make
weight
against
her
ardent
imagination
by
studying
science
art
and
letters
but
in
these
studies
she
acquired
the
taste
for
independence
and
liberal
ideas
which
threw
her
with
her
husband
into
the
ranks
of
the
revolution
rodolphe
had
not
yet
learned
that
besides
five
living
languages
francesca
knew
greek
latin
and
hebrew
the
charming
creature
perfectly
understood
that
for
a
woman
the
first
condition
of
being
learned
is
to
keep
it
deeply
hidden
rodolphe
spent
the
whole
winter
at
geneva
this
winter
passed
like
a
day
when
spring
returned
notwithstanding
the
infinite
delights
of
the
society
of
a
clever
woman
wonderfully
well
informed
young
and
lovely
the
lover
went
through
cruel
sufferings
endured
indeed
with
courage
but
which
were
sometimes
legible
in
his
countenance
and
betrayed
themselves
in
his
manners
or
speech
perhaps
because
he
believed
that
francesca
shared
them
now
and
again
it
annoyed
him
to
admire
her
calmness
like
an
englishwoman
she
seemed
to
pride
herself
on
expressing
nothing
in
her
face
its
serenity
defied
love
he
longed
to
see
her
agitated
he
accused
her
of
having
no
feeling
for
he
believed
in
the
tradition
which
ascribes
to
italian
women
a
feverish
excitability
i
am
a
roman
francesca
gravely
replied
one
day
when
she
took
quite
seriously
some
banter
on
this
subject
from
rodolphe
there
was
a
depth
of
tone
in
her
reply
which
gave
it
the
appearance
of
scathing
irony
and
which
set
rodolphe
s
pulses
throbbing
the
month
of
may
spread
before
them
the
treasures
of
her
fresh
verdure
the
sun
was
sometimes
as
powerful
as
at
midsummer
the
two
lovers
happened
to
be
at
a
part
of
the
terrace
where
the
rock
arises
abruptly
from
the
lake
and
were
leaning
over
the
stone
parapet
that
crowns
the
wall
above
a
flight
of
steps
leading
down
to
a
from
the
neighboring
villa
where
there
is
a
similar
stairway
a
boat
presently
shot
out
like
a
swan
its
flag
flaming
its
crimson
awning
spread
over
a
lovely
woman
comfortably
reclining
on
red
cushions
her
hair
wreathed
with
real
flowers
the
boatman
was
a
young
man
dressed
like
a
sailor
and
rowing
with
all
the
more
grace
because
he
was
under
the
lady
s
eye
they
are
happy
exclaimed
rodolphe
with
bitter
emphasis
claire
de
bourgogne
the
last
survivor
of
the
only
house
which
can
ever
vie
with
the
royal
family
of
france
oh
of
a
bastard
branch
and
that
a
female
at
any
rate
she
is
vicomtesse
de
beauseant
and
she
did
not
did
not
hesitate
you
would
say
to
bury
herself
here
with
monsieur
gaston
de
nueil
you
would
say
replied
the
daughter
of
the
colonnas
she
is
only
a
frenchwoman
i
am
an
italian
my
dear
sir
francesca
turned
away
from
the
parapet
leaving
rodolphe
and
went
to
the
further
end
of
the
terrace
whence
there
is
a
wide
prospect
of
the
lake
watching
her
as
she
slowly
walked
away
rodolphe
suspected
that
he
had
wounded
her
soul
at
once
so
simple
and
so
wise
so
proud
and
so
humble
it
turned
him
cold
he
followed
francesca
who
signed
to
him
to
leave
her
to
herself
but
he
did
not
heed
the
warning
and
detected
her
wiping
away
her
tears
tears
in
so
strong
a
nature
francesca
said
he
taking
her
hand
is
there
a
single
regret
in
your
heart
she
was
silent
disengaged
her
hand
which
held
her
embroidered
handkerchief
and
again
dried
her
eyes
forgive
me
he
said
and
with
a
rush
he
kissed
her
eyes
to
wipe
away
the
tears
francesca
did
not
seem
aware
of
his
passionate
impulse
she
was
so
violently
agitated
rodolphe
thinking
she
consented
grew
bolder
he
put
his
arm
round
her
clasped
her
to
his
heart
and
snatched
a
kiss
but
she
freed
herself
by
a
dignified
movement
of
offended
modesty
and
standing
a
yard
off
she
looked
at
him
without
anger
but
with
firm
determination
go
this
evening
she
said
we
meet
no
more
till
we
meet
at
this
order
was
stern
but
it
was
obeyed
for
it
was
francesca
s
will
on
his
return
to
paris
rodolphe
found
in
his
rooms
a
portrait
of
princess
gandolphini
painted
by
schinner
as
schinner
can
paint
the
artist
had
passed
through
geneva
on
his
way
to
italy
as
he
had
positively
refused
to
paint
the
portraits
of
several
women
rodolphe
did
not
believe
that
the
prince
anxious
as
he
was
for
a
portrait
of
his
wife
would
be
able
to
conquer
the
great
painter
s
objections
but
francesca
no
doubt
had
bewitched
him
and
obtained
from
him
which
was
almost
a
miracle
an
original
portrait
for
rodolphe
and
a
duplicate
for
emilio
she
told
him
this
in
a
charming
and
delightful
letter
in
which
the
mind
indemnified
itself
for
the
reserve
required
by
the
worship
of
the
proprieties
the
lover
replied
thus
began
never
to
cease
a
regular
correspondence
between
rodolphe
and
francesca
the
only
indulgence
they
allowed
themselves
rodolphe
possessed
by
an
ambition
sanctified
by
his
love
set
to
work
first
he
longed
to
make
his
fortune
and
risked
his
all
in
an
undertaking
to
which
he
devoted
all
his
faculties
as
well
as
his
capital
but
he
an
inexperienced
youth
had
to
contend
against
duplicity
which
won
the
day
thus
three
years
were
lost
in
a
vast
enterprise
three
years
of
struggling
and
courage
the
villele
ministry
fell
just
when
rodolphe
was
ruined
the
valiant
lover
thought
he
would
seek
in
politics
what
commercial
industry
had
refused
him
but
before
braving
the
storms
of
this
career
he
went
all
wounded
and
sick
at
heart
to
have
his
bruises
healed
and
his
courage
revived
at
naples
where
the
prince
and
princess
had
been
reinstated
in
their
place
and
rights
on
the
king
s
accession
this
in
the
midst
of
his
warfare
was
a
respite
full
of
delights
he
spent
three
months
at
the
villa
gandolphini
rocked
in
hope
rodolphe
then
began
again
to
construct
his
fortune
his
talents
were
already
known
he
was
about
to
attain
the
desires
of
his
ambition
a
high
position
was
promised
him
as
the
reward
of
his
zeal
his
devotion
and
his
past
services
when
the
storm
of
july
broke
and
again
his
bark
was
swamped
she
and
god
these
are
the
only
witnesses
of
the
brave
efforts
the
daring
attempts
of
a
young
man
gifted
with
fine
qualities
but
to
whom
so
far
the
protection
of
luck
the
god
of
fools
has
been
denied
and
this
indefatigable
wrestler
upheld
by
love
comes
back
to
fresh
struggles
lighted
on
his
way
by
an
always
friendly
eye
an
ever
faithful
heart
lovers
pray
for
him
as
she
finished
this
narrative
mademoiselle
de
watteville
s
cheeks
were
on
fire
there
was
a
fever
in
her
blood
she
was
crying
but
with
rage
this
little
novel
inspired
by
the
literary
style
then
in
fashion
was
the
first
reading
of
the
kind
that
rosalie
had
ever
had
the
chance
of
devouring
love
was
depicted
in
it
if
not
by
a
at
any
rate
by
a
man
who
seemed
to
give
his
own
impressions
and
truth
even
if
unskilled
could
not
fail
to
touch
a
virgin
soul
here
lay
the
secret
of
rosalie
s
terrible
agitation
of
her
fever
and
her
tears
she
was
jealous
of
francesca
colonna
she
never
for
an
instant
doubted
the
sincerity
of
this
poetical
flight
albert
had
taken
pleasure
in
telling
the
story
of
his
passion
while
changing
the
names
of
persons
and
perhaps
of
places
rosalie
was
possessed
by
infernal
curiosity
what
woman
but
would
like
her
have
wanted
to
know
her
rival
s
name
for
she
too
loved
as
she
read
these
pages
to
her
really
contagious
she
had
said
solemnly
to
herself
i
love
him
she
loved
albert
and
felt
in
her
heart
a
gnawing
desire
to
fight
for
him
to
snatch
him
from
this
unknown
rival
she
reflected
that
she
knew
nothing
of
music
and
that
she
was
not
beautiful
he
will
never
love
me
thought
she
this
conclusion
aggravated
her
anxiety
to
know
whether
she
might
not
be
mistaken
whether
albert
really
loved
an
italian
princess
and
was
loved
by
her
in
the
course
of
this
fateful
night
the
power
of
swift
decision
which
had
characterized
the
famous
watteville
was
fully
developed
in
his
descendant
she
devised
those
whimsical
schemes
round
which
hovers
the
imagination
of
most
young
girls
when
in
the
solitude
to
which
some
injudicious
mothers
confine
them
they
are
roused
by
some
tremendous
event
which
the
system
of
repression
to
which
they
are
subjected
could
neither
foresee
nor
prevent
she
dreamed
of
descending
by
a
ladder
from
the
kiosk
into
the
garden
of
the
house
occupied
by
albert
of
taking
advantage
of
the
lawyer
s
being
asleep
to
look
through
the
window
into
his
private
room
she
thought
of
writing
to
him
or
of
bursting
the
fetters
of
besancon
society
by
introducing
albert
to
the
of
the
hotel
de
rupt
this
enterprise
which
to
the
abbe
de
grancey
even
would
have
seemed
the
climax
of
the
impossible
was
a
mere
passing
thought
ah
said
she
to
herself
my
father
has
a
dispute
pending
as
to
his
land
at
les
rouxey
i
will
go
there
if
there
is
no
lawsuit
i
will
manage
to
make
one
and
shall
come
into
our
she
cried
as
she
sprang
out
of
bed
and
to
the
window
to
look
at
the
fascinating
gleam
which
shone
through
albert
s
nights
the
clock
struck
one
he
was
still
asleep
i
shall
see
him
when
he
gets
up
perhaps
he
will
come
to
his
at
this
instant
mademoiselle
de
watteville
was
witness
to
an
incident
which
promised
to
place
in
her
power
the
means
of
knowing
albert
s
secrets
by
the
light
of
the
moon
she
saw
a
pair
of
arms
stretched
out
from
the
kiosk
to
help
jerome
albert
s
servant
to
get
across
the
coping
of
the
wall
and
step
into
the
little
building
in
jerome
s
accomplice
rosalie
at
once
recognized
mariette
the
lady
mariette
and
jerome
said
she
to
herself
mariette
such
an
ugly
girl
certainly
they
must
be
ashamed
of
though
mariette
was
horribly
ugly
and
she
had
inherited
several
plots
of
land
she
had
been
seventeen
years
with
madame
de
watteville
who
valued
her
highly
for
her
bigotry
her
honesty
and
long
service
and
she
had
no
doubt
saved
money
and
invested
her
wages
and
perquisites
hence
earning
about
ten
louis
a
year
she
probably
had
by
this
time
including
compound
interest
and
her
little
inheritance
not
less
than
ten
thousand
francs
in
jerome
s
eyes
ten
thousand
francs
could
alter
the
laws
of
optics
he
saw
in
mariette
a
neat
figure
he
did
not
perceive
the
pits
and
seams
which
virulent
smallpox
had
left
on
her
flat
parched
face
to
him
the
crooked
mouth
was
straight
and
ever
since
savaron
by
taking
him
into
his
service
had
brought
him
so
near
to
the
wattevilles
house
he
had
laid
siege
systematically
to
the
maid
who
was
as
prim
and
sanctimonious
as
her
mistress
and
who
like
every
ugly
old
maid
was
far
more
exacting
than
the
handsomest
if
the
in
the
kiosk
is
thus
fully
accounted
for
to
all
perspicacious
readers
it
was
not
so
to
rosalie
though
she
derived
from
it
the
most
dangerous
lesson
that
can
be
given
that
of
a
bad
example
a
mother
brings
her
daughter
up
strictly
keeps
her
under
her
wing
for
seventeen
years
and
then
in
one
hour
a
servant
girl
destroys
the
long
and
painful
work
sometimes
by
a
word
often
indeed
by
a
gesture
rosalie
got
into
bed
again
not
without
considering
how
she
might
take
advantage
of
her
discovery
next
morning
as
she
went
to
mass
accompanied
by
mariette
her
mother
was
not
well
rosalie
took
the
maid
s
arm
which
surprised
the
country
wench
not
a
little
mariette
said
she
is
jerome
in
his
master
s
confidence
i
do
not
know
do
not
play
the
innocent
with
me
said
mademoiselle
de
watteville
drily
you
let
him
kiss
you
last
night
under
the
kiosk
i
no
longer
wonder
that
you
so
warmly
approved
of
my
mother
s
ideas
for
the
improvements
she
rosalie
could
feel
how
mariette
was
trembling
by
the
shaking
of
her
arm
i
wish
you
no
ill
rosalie
went
on
be
quite
easy
i
shall
not
say
a
word
to
my
mother
and
you
can
meet
jerome
as
often
as
you
but
mademoiselle
said
mariette
it
is
perfectly
respectable
jerome
honestly
means
to
marry
me
but
then
said
rosalie
why
meet
at
night
mariette
was
dumfounded
and
could
make
no
reply
listen
mariette
i
am
in
love
too
in
secret
and
without
any
return
i
am
after
all
my
father
s
and
mother
s
only
child
you
have
more
to
hope
for
from
me
than
from
any
one
else
in
the
world
certainly
mademoiselle
and
you
may
count
on
us
for
life
or
death
exclaimed
mariette
rejoiced
at
the
unexpected
turn
of
affairs
in
the
first
place
silence
for
silence
said
rosalie
i
will
not
marry
monsieur
de
soulas
but
one
thing
i
will
have
and
must
have
my
help
and
favor
are
yours
on
one
condition
what
is
that
i
must
see
the
letters
which
monsieur
savaron
sends
to
the
post
by
but
what
for
said
mariette
in
alarm
oh
merely
to
read
them
and
you
yourself
shall
post
them
afterwards
it
will
cause
a
little
delay
that
is
at
this
moment
they
went
into
church
and
each
of
them
instead
of
reading
the
order
of
mass
fell
into
her
own
train
of
thought
dear
dear
how
many
sins
are
there
in
all
that
thought
mariette
rosalie
whose
soul
brain
and
heart
were
completely
upset
by
reading
the
story
by
this
time
regarded
it
as
history
written
for
her
rival
by
dint
of
thinking
of
nothing
else
like
a
child
she
ended
by
believing
that
the
was
no
doubt
forwarded
to
albert
s
oh
said
she
to
herself
her
head
buried
in
her
hands
in
the
attitude
of
a
person
lost
in
prayer
oh
how
can
i
get
my
father
to
look
through
the
list
of
people
to
whom
the
is
sent
after
breakfast
she
took
a
turn
in
the
garden
with
her
father
coaxing
and
cajoling
him
and
brought
him
to
the
kiosk
do
you
suppose
my
dear
little
papa
that
our
is
ever
read
abroad
it
is
but
just
started
well
i
will
wager
that
it
it
is
hardly
just
go
and
find
out
and
note
the
names
of
any
subscribers
out
of
two
hours
later
monsieur
de
watteville
said
to
his
daughter
i
was
right
there
is
not
one
foreign
subscriber
as
yet
they
hope
to
get
some
at
neufchatel
at
berne
and
at
geneva
one
copy
is
in
fact
sent
to
italy
but
it
is
not
paid
for
to
a
milanese
lady
at
her
country
house
at
belgirate
on
lago
maggiore
what
is
her
name
the
duchesse
d
do
you
know
her
papa
i
have
heard
about
her
she
was
by
birth
a
princess
soderini
a
florentine
a
very
great
lady
and
quite
as
rich
as
her
husband
who
has
one
of
the
largest
fortunes
in
lombardy
their
villa
on
the
lago
maggiore
is
one
of
the
sights
of
two
days
after
mariette
placed
the
following
letter
in
mademoiselle
de
watteville
s
hand
albert
savaron
to
leopold
hannequin
yes
tis
so
my
dear
friend
i
am
at
besancon
while
you
thought
i
was
traveling
i
would
not
tell
you
anything
till
success
should
begin
and
now
it
is
dawning
yes
my
dear
leopold
after
so
many
abortive
undertakings
over
which
i
have
shed
the
best
of
my
blood
have
wasted
so
many
efforts
spent
so
much
courage
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
do
as
you
have
done
to
start
on
a
beaten
path
on
the
highroad
as
the
longest
but
the
safest
i
can
see
you
jump
with
surprise
in
your
lawyer
s
chair
but
do
not
suppose
that
anything
is
changed
in
my
personal
life
of
which
you
alone
in
the
world
know
the
secret
and
that
under
the
reservations
insists
on
i
did
not
tell
you
my
friend
but
i
was
horribly
weary
of
paris
the
outcome
of
the
first
enterprise
on
which
i
had
founded
all
my
hopes
and
which
came
to
a
bad
end
in
consequence
of
the
utter
rascality
of
my
two
partners
who
combined
to
cheat
and
fleece
me
me
though
everything
was
done
by
my
energy
made
me
give
up
the
pursuit
of
a
fortune
after
the
loss
of
three
years
of
my
life
one
of
these
years
was
spent
in
the
law
courts
and
perhaps
i
should
have
come
worse
out
of
the
scrape
if
i
had
not
been
made
to
study
law
when
i
was
twenty
i
made
up
my
mind
to
go
into
politics
solely
to
the
end
that
i
may
some
day
find
my
name
on
a
list
for
promotion
to
the
senate
under
the
title
of
comte
albert
savaron
de
savarus
and
so
revive
in
france
a
good
name
now
extinct
in
belgium
though
indeed
i
am
neither
legitimate
nor
ah
i
knew
it
he
is
of
noble
birth
exclaimed
rosalie
dropping
the
letter
you
know
how
conscientiously
i
studied
how
faithful
and
useful
i
was
as
an
obscure
journalist
and
how
excellent
a
secretary
to
the
statesman
who
on
his
part
was
true
to
me
in
flung
to
the
depths
once
more
by
the
revolution
of
july
just
when
my
name
was
becoming
known
at
the
very
moment
when
as
master
of
appeals
i
was
about
to
find
my
place
as
a
necessary
wheel
in
the
political
machine
i
committed
the
blunder
of
remaining
faithful
to
the
fallen
and
fighting
for
them
without
them
oh
why
was
i
but
and
why
did
i
not
apply
to
you
to
make
me
eligible
i
concealed
from
you
all
my
devotedness
and
my
dangers
what
would
you
have
i
was
full
of
faith
we
should
not
have
agreed
ten
months
ago
when
you
saw
me
so
gay
and
contented
writing
my
political
articles
i
was
in
despair
i
foresaw
my
fate
at
the
age
of
with
two
thousand
francs
for
my
whole
fortune
without
the
smallest
fame
just
having
failed
in
a
noble
undertaking
the
founding
namely
of
a
daily
paper
answering
only
to
a
need
of
the
future
instead
of
appealing
to
the
passions
of
the
moment
i
did
not
know
which
way
to
turn
and
i
felt
my
own
value
i
wandered
about
gloomy
and
hurt
through
the
lonely
places
of
paris
paris
which
had
slipped
through
my
fingers
thinking
of
my
crushed
ambitions
but
never
giving
them
up
oh
what
frantic
letters
i
wrote
at
that
time
to
my
second
conscience
my
other
self
sometimes
i
would
say
to
myself
why
did
i
sketch
so
vast
a
programme
of
life
why
demand
everything
why
not
wait
for
happiness
while
devoting
myself
to
some
mechanical
i
then
looked
about
me
for
some
modest
appointment
by
which
i
might
live
i
was
about
to
get
the
editorship
of
a
paper
under
a
manager
who
did
not
know
much
about
it
a
man
of
wealth
and
ambition
when
i
took
fright
would
ever
accept
as
her
husband
a
man
who
had
stooped
so
low
i
wondered
this
reflection
made
me
again
but
oh
my
dear
leopold
how
the
soul
is
worn
by
these
perplexities
what
must
not
the
caged
eagles
suffer
and
imprisoned
lions
they
suffer
what
napoleon
suffered
not
at
saint
helena
but
on
the
quay
of
the
tuileries
on
the
of
august
when
he
saw
louis
xvi
defending
himself
so
badly
while
he
could
have
quelled
the
insurrection
as
he
actually
did
on
the
same
spot
a
little
later
in
vendemiaire
well
my
life
has
been
a
torment
of
that
kind
extending
over
four
years
how
many
a
speech
to
the
chamber
have
i
not
delivered
in
the
deserted
alleys
of
the
bois
de
boulogne
these
wasted
harangues
have
at
any
rate
sharpened
my
tongue
and
accustomed
my
mind
to
formulate
its
ideas
in
words
and
while
i
was
undergoing
this
secret
torture
you
were
getting
married
you
had
paid
for
your
business
you
were
made
to
the
maire
of
your
district
after
gaining
a
cross
for
a
wound
at
now
listen
when
i
was
a
small
boy
and
tortured
the
poor
insects
had
one
form
of
struggle
which
used
almost
to
put
me
in
a
fever
it
was
when
i
saw
them
making
repeated
efforts
to
fly
but
without
getting
away
though
they
could
spread
their
wings
we
used
to
say
they
are
marking
now
was
this
sympathy
was
it
a
vision
of
my
own
future
oh
to
spread
my
wings
and
yet
be
unable
to
fly
that
has
been
my
predicament
since
that
fine
undertaking
by
which
i
was
disgusted
but
which
has
now
made
four
families
rich
at
last
seven
months
ago
i
determined
to
make
myself
a
name
at
the
paris
bar
seeing
how
many
vacancies
had
been
left
by
the
promotion
of
several
lawyers
to
eminent
positions
but
when
i
remembered
the
rivalry
i
had
seen
among
men
of
the
press
and
how
difficult
it
is
to
achieve
anything
of
any
kind
in
paris
the
arena
where
so
many
champions
meet
i
came
to
a
determination
painful
to
myself
but
certain
in
its
results
and
perhaps
quicker
than
any
other
in
the
course
of
our
conversations
you
had
given
me
a
picture
of
the
society
of
besancon
of
the
impossibility
for
a
stranger
to
get
on
there
to
produce
the
smallest
effect
to
get
into
society
or
to
succeed
in
any
way
whatever
it
was
there
that
i
determined
to
set
up
my
flag
thinking
and
rightly
that
i
should
meet
with
no
opposition
but
find
myself
alone
to
canvass
for
the
election
the
people
of
the
comte
will
not
meet
the
outsider
the
outsider
will
meet
them
they
refuse
to
admit
him
to
their
he
will
never
go
there
he
never
shows
himself
anywhere
not
even
in
the
streets
but
there
is
one
class
that
elects
the
deputies
the
commercial
class
i
am
going
especially
to
study
commercial
questions
with
which
i
am
already
familiar
i
will
gain
their
lawsuits
i
will
effect
compromises
i
will
be
the
greatest
pleader
in
besancon
by
and
by
i
will
start
a
in
which
i
will
defend
the
interests
of
the
country
will
create
them
or
preserve
them
or
resuscitate
them
when
i
shall
have
won
a
sufficient
number
of
votes
my
name
will
come
out
of
the
urn
for
a
long
time
the
unknown
barrister
will
be
treated
with
contempt
but
some
circumstance
will
arise
to
bring
him
to
the
front
some
unpaid
defence
or
a
case
which
no
other
pleader
will
undertake
well
my
dear
leopold
i
packed
up
my
books
in
eleven
cases
i
bought
such
as
might
prove
useful
and
i
sent
everything
off
furniture
and
all
by
carrier
to
besancon
i
collected
my
diplomas
and
i
went
to
bid
you
the
mail
coach
dropped
me
at
besancon
where
in
three
days
time
i
chose
a
little
set
of
rooms
looking
out
over
some
gardens
i
sumptuously
arranged
the
mysterious
private
room
where
i
spend
my
nights
and
days
and
where
the
portrait
of
my
divinity
reigns
of
her
to
whom
my
life
is
dedicate
who
fills
it
wholly
who
is
the
mainspring
of
my
efforts
the
secret
of
my
courage
the
cause
of
my
talents
then
as
soon
as
the
furniture
and
books
had
come
i
engaged
an
intelligent
and
there
i
sat
for
five
months
like
a
hibernating
marmot
my
name
had
however
been
entered
on
the
list
of
lawyers
in
the
town
at
last
i
was
called
one
day
to
defend
an
unhappy
wretch
at
the
assizes
no
doubt
in
order
to
hear
me
speak
for
once
one
of
the
most
influential
merchants
of
besancon
was
on
the
jury
he
had
a
difficult
task
to
fulfil
i
did
my
utmost
for
the
man
and
my
success
was
absolute
and
complete
my
client
was
innocent
i
very
dramatically
secured
the
arrest
of
the
real
criminals
who
had
come
forward
as
witnesses
in
short
the
court
and
the
public
were
united
in
their
admiration
i
managed
to
save
the
examining
magistrate
s
pride
by
pointing
out
the
impossibility
of
detecting
a
plot
so
skilfully
planned
then
i
had
to
fight
a
case
for
my
merchant
and
won
his
suit
the
cathedral
chapter
next
chose
me
to
defend
a
tremendous
action
against
the
town
which
had
been
going
on
for
four
years
i
won
that
thus
after
three
trials
i
had
become
the
most
famous
advocate
of
but
i
bury
my
life
in
the
deepest
mystery
and
so
hide
my
aims
i
have
adopted
habits
which
prevent
my
accepting
any
invitations
i
am
only
to
be
consulted
between
six
and
eight
in
the
morning
i
go
to
bed
after
my
dinner
and
work
at
night
the
a
man
of
parts
and
very
influential
who
placed
the
chapter
s
case
in
my
hands
after
they
had
lost
it
in
the
lower
court
of
course
professed
their
gratitude
monsieur
said
i
i
will
win
your
suit
but
i
want
no
fee
i
want
more
start
of
alarm
on
the
abbe
s
part
you
must
know
that
i
am
a
great
loser
by
putting
myself
forward
in
antagonism
to
the
town
i
came
here
only
to
leave
the
place
as
deputy
i
mean
to
engage
only
in
commercial
cases
because
commercial
men
return
the
members
they
will
distrust
me
if
i
defend
the
priests
for
to
them
you
are
simply
priests
if
i
undertake
your
defence
it
is
because
i
was
in
private
secretary
to
such
a
minister
again
a
start
of
surprise
on
the
part
of
my
abbe
and
master
of
appeals
under
the
name
of
albert
de
savarus
another
start
i
have
remained
faithful
to
monarchical
opinions
but
as
you
have
not
the
majority
of
votes
in
besancon
i
must
gain
votes
among
the
citizens
so
the
fee
i
ask
of
you
is
the
votes
you
may
be
able
secretly
to
secure
for
me
at
the
opportune
moment
let
us
each
keep
our
own
counsel
and
i
will
defend
for
nothing
every
case
to
which
a
priest
of
this
diocese
may
be
a
party
not
a
word
about
my
previous
life
and
we
will
be
true
to
each
when
he
came
to
thank
me
afterwards
he
gave
me
a
note
for
five
hundred
francs
and
said
in
my
ear
the
votes
are
a
bargain
all
the
i
have
in
the
course
of
five
interviews
made
a
friend
i
think
of
this
now
i
am
overwhelmed
with
business
and
i
undertake
no
cases
but
those
brought
to
me
by
merchants
saying
that
commercial
questions
are
my
specialty
this
line
of
conduct
attaches
business
men
to
me
and
allows
me
to
make
friends
with
influential
persons
so
all
goes
well
within
a
few
months
i
shall
have
found
a
house
to
purchase
in
besancon
so
as
to
secure
a
qualification
i
count
on
your
lending
me
the
necessary
capital
for
this
investment
if
i
should
die
if
i
should
fail
the
loss
would
be
too
small
to
be
any
consideration
between
you
and
me
you
will
get
the
interest
out
of
the
rental
and
i
shall
take
good
care
to
look
out
for
something
cheap
so
that
you
may
lose
nothing
by
this
mortgage
which
is
indispensable
oh
my
dear
leopold
no
gambler
with
the
last
remains
of
his
fortune
in
his
pocket
bent
on
staking
it
at
the
cercle
des
etrangers
for
the
last
time
one
night
when
he
must
come
away
rich
or
ruined
ever
felt
such
a
perpetual
ringing
in
his
ears
such
a
nervous
moisture
on
his
palms
such
a
fevered
tumult
in
his
brain
such
inward
qualms
in
his
body
as
i
go
through
every
day
now
that
i
am
playing
my
last
card
in
the
game
of
ambition
alas
my
dear
and
only
friend
for
nearly
ten
years
now
i
have
been
struggling
this
battle
with
men
and
things
in
which
i
have
unceasingly
poured
out
my
strength
and
energy
and
so
constantly
worn
the
springs
of
desire
has
so
to
speak
undermined
my
vitality
with
all
the
appearance
of
a
strong
man
of
good
health
i
feel
myself
a
wreck
every
day
carries
with
it
a
shred
of
my
inmost
life
at
every
fresh
effort
i
feel
that
i
should
never
be
able
to
begin
again
i
have
no
power
no
vigor
left
but
for
happiness
and
if
it
should
never
come
to
crown
my
head
with
roses
the
that
is
really
me
would
cease
to
exist
i
should
be
a
ruined
thing
i
should
wish
for
nothing
more
in
the
world
i
should
want
to
cease
from
living
you
know
that
power
and
fame
the
vast
moral
empire
that
i
crave
is
but
secondary
it
is
to
me
only
a
means
to
happiness
the
pedestal
for
my
idol
to
reach
the
goal
and
die
like
the
runner
of
antiquity
to
see
fortune
and
death
stand
on
the
threshold
hand
in
hand
to
win
the
beloved
woman
just
when
love
is
extinct
to
lose
the
faculty
of
enjoyment
after
earning
the
right
to
be
happy
of
how
many
men
has
this
been
the
fate
but
there
surely
is
a
moment
when
tantalus
rebels
crosses
his
arms
and
defies
hell
throwing
up
his
part
of
the
eternal
dupe
that
is
what
i
shall
come
to
if
anything
should
thwart
my
plan
if
after
stooping
to
the
dust
of
provincial
life
prowling
like
a
starving
tiger
round
these
tradesmen
these
electors
to
secure
their
votes
if
after
wrangling
in
these
squalid
cases
and
giving
them
my
time
the
time
i
might
have
spent
on
lago
maggiore
seeing
the
waters
she
sees
basking
in
her
gaze
hearing
her
voice
if
after
all
i
failed
to
scale
the
tribune
and
conquer
the
glory
that
should
surround
the
name
that
is
to
succeed
to
that
of
argaiolo
nay
more
than
this
leopold
there
are
days
when
i
feel
a
heady
languor
deep
disgust
surges
up
from
the
depths
of
my
soul
especially
when
abandoned
to
long
i
have
lost
myself
in
anticipation
of
the
joys
of
blissful
love
may
it
not
be
that
our
desire
has
only
a
certain
modicum
of
power
and
that
it
perishes
perhaps
of
a
too
lavish
effusion
of
its
essence
for
after
all
at
this
present
my
life
is
fair
illuminated
by
faith
work
and
love
farewell
my
friend
i
send
love
to
your
children
and
beg
you
to
remember
me
to
your
excellent
yours
rosalie
read
this
letter
twice
through
and
its
general
purport
was
stamped
on
her
heart
she
suddenly
saw
the
whole
of
albert
s
previous
existence
for
her
quick
intelligence
threw
light
on
all
the
details
and
enabled
her
to
take
it
all
in
by
adding
this
information
to
the
little
novel
published
in
the
she
now
fully
understood
albert
of
course
she
exaggerated
the
greatness
remarkable
as
it
was
of
this
lofty
soul
and
potent
will
and
her
love
for
albert
thenceforth
became
a
passion
its
violence
enhanced
by
all
the
strength
of
her
youth
the
weariness
of
her
solitude
and
the
unspent
energy
of
her
character
love
is
in
a
young
girl
the
effect
of
a
natural
law
but
when
her
craving
for
affection
is
centered
in
an
exceptional
man
it
is
mingled
with
the
enthusiasm
which
overflows
in
a
youthful
heart
thus
mademoiselle
de
watteville
had
in
a
few
days
reached
a
morbid
and
very
dangerous
stage
of
enamored
infatuation
the
baroness
was
much
pleased
with
her
daughter
who
being
under
the
spell
of
her
absorbing
thoughts
never
resisted
her
will
seemed
to
be
devoted
to
feminine
occupations
and
realized
her
mother
s
ideal
of
a
docile
daughter
the
lawyer
was
now
engaged
in
court
two
or
three
times
a
week
though
he
was
overwhelmed
with
business
he
found
time
to
attend
the
trials
call
on
the
litigious
merchants
and
conduct
the
keeping
up
his
personal
mystery
from
the
conviction
that
the
more
covert
and
hidden
was
his
influence
the
more
real
it
would
be
but
he
neglected
no
means
of
success
reading
up
the
list
of
electors
of
besancon
and
finding
out
their
interests
their
characters
their
various
friendships
and
antipathies
did
ever
a
cardinal
hoping
to
be
made
pope
give
himself
more
trouble
one
evening
mariette
on
coming
to
dress
rosalie
for
an
evening
party
handed
to
her
not
without
many
groans
over
this
treachery
a
letter
of
which
the
address
made
mademoiselle
de
watteville
shiver
and
redden
and
turn
pale
again
as
she
read
the
address
to
madame
la
duchesse
d
argaiolo
nee
princesse
soderini
at
belgirate
lago
maggiore
italy
in
her
eyes
this
direction
blazed
as
the
words
did
in
the
eyes
of
belshazzar
after
concealing
the
letter
rosalie
went
downstairs
to
accompany
her
mother
to
madame
de
chavoncourt
s
and
as
long
as
the
endless
evening
lasted
she
was
tormented
by
remorse
and
scruples
she
had
already
felt
shame
at
having
violated
the
secrecy
of
albert
s
letter
to
leopold
she
had
several
times
asked
herself
whether
if
he
knew
of
her
crime
infamous
inasmuch
as
it
necessarily
goes
unpunished
the
albert
could
esteem
her
her
conscience
answered
an
uncompromising
she
had
expiated
her
sin
by
penances
she
fasted
she
mortified
herself
by
remaining
on
her
knees
her
arms
outstretched
for
hours
and
repeating
prayers
all
the
time
she
had
compelled
mariette
to
similar
sets
of
repentance
her
passion
was
mingled
with
genuine
asceticism
and
was
all
the
more
dangerous
shall
i
read
that
letter
shall
i
not
she
asked
herself
while
listening
to
the
chavoncourt
girls
one
was
sixteen
the
other
seventeen
and
a
half
rosalie
looked
upon
her
two
friends
as
mere
children
because
they
were
not
secretly
in
if
i
read
it
she
finally
decided
after
hesitating
for
an
hour
between
yes
and
no
it
shall
at
any
rate
be
the
last
since
i
have
gone
so
far
as
to
see
what
he
wrote
to
his
friend
why
should
i
not
know
what
he
says
to
if
it
is
a
horrible
crime
is
it
not
a
proof
of
love
oh
albert
am
i
not
your
wife
when
rosalie
was
in
bed
she
opened
the
letter
dated
from
day
to
day
so
as
to
give
the
duchess
a
faithful
picture
of
albert
s
life
and
feelings
my
dear
soul
all
is
well
to
my
other
conquests
i
have
just
added
an
invaluable
one
i
have
done
a
service
to
one
of
the
most
influential
men
who
work
the
elections
like
the
critics
who
make
other
men
s
reputations
but
can
never
make
their
own
he
makes
deputies
though
he
never
can
become
one
the
worthy
man
wanted
to
show
his
gratitude
without
loosening
his
by
saying
to
me
would
you
care
to
sit
in
the
chamber
i
can
get
you
returned
as
if
i
ever
make
up
my
mind
to
enter
on
a
political
career
replied
i
hypocritically
it
would
be
to
devote
myself
to
the
comte
which
i
love
and
where
i
am
well
he
said
we
will
persuade
you
and
through
you
we
shall
have
weight
in
the
chamber
for
you
will
distinguish
yourself
and
so
my
beloved
angel
say
what
you
will
my
perseverance
will
be
rewarded
ere
long
i
shall
from
the
high
place
of
the
french
tribune
come
before
my
country
before
europe
my
name
will
be
flung
to
you
by
the
hundred
voices
of
the
french
press
yes
as
you
tell
me
i
was
old
when
i
came
to
besancon
and
besancon
has
aged
me
more
but
like
sixtus
i
shall
be
young
again
the
day
after
my
election
i
shall
enter
on
my
true
life
my
own
sphere
shall
we
not
then
stand
in
the
same
line
count
savaron
de
savarus
ambassador
i
know
not
where
may
surely
marry
a
princess
soderini
the
widow
of
the
duc
d
argaiolo
triumph
restores
the
youth
of
men
who
have
been
preserved
by
incessant
struggles
oh
my
life
with
what
gladness
did
i
fly
from
my
library
to
my
private
room
to
tell
your
portrait
of
this
progress
before
writing
to
you
yes
the
votes
i
can
command
those
of
the
of
the
persons
i
can
oblige
and
of
this
client
make
my
election
already
sure
we
have
entered
on
the
twelfth
year
since
that
blest
evening
when
by
a
look
the
beautiful
duchess
sealed
the
promises
made
by
the
exile
francesca
you
dear
are
i
am
the
dear
duke
is
that
is
to
say
ten
years
more
than
yours
and
mine
put
together
and
he
still
keeps
well
my
patience
is
almost
as
great
as
my
love
and
indeed
i
need
a
few
years
yet
to
rise
to
the
level
of
your
name
as
you
see
i
am
in
good
spirits
i
can
laugh
that
is
the
effect
of
hope
sadness
or
gladness
it
all
comes
to
me
through
you
the
hope
of
success
always
carries
me
back
to
the
day
following
that
one
on
which
i
saw
you
for
the
first
time
when
my
life
became
one
with
yours
as
the
earth
turns
to
the
light
are
these
eleven
years
for
this
is
the
of
december
the
anniversary
of
my
arrival
at
your
villa
on
the
lake
of
geneva
for
eleven
years
have
i
been
crying
to
you
while
you
shine
like
a
star
set
too
high
for
man
to
reach
it
no
dearest
do
not
go
to
milan
stay
at
belgirate
milan
terrifies
me
i
do
not
like
that
odious
milanese
fashion
of
chatting
at
the
scala
every
evening
with
a
dozen
persons
among
whom
it
is
hard
if
no
one
says
something
sweet
to
me
solitude
is
like
the
lump
of
amber
in
whose
heart
an
insect
lives
for
ever
in
unchanging
beauty
thus
the
heart
and
soul
of
a
woman
remains
pure
and
unaltered
in
the
form
of
their
first
youth
is
it
the
that
you
regret
is
your
statue
never
to
be
finished
i
should
wish
to
have
you
in
marble
in
painting
in
miniature
in
every
possible
form
to
beguile
my
impatience
i
still
am
waiting
for
the
view
of
belgirate
from
the
south
and
that
of
the
balcony
these
are
all
that
i
now
lack
i
am
so
extremely
busy
that
i
can
only
write
you
nothing
but
that
nothing
is
everything
was
it
not
of
nothing
that
god
made
the
world
that
nothing
is
a
word
god
s
word
i
love
you
ah
i
have
received
your
journal
thanks
for
your
punctuality
so
you
found
great
pleasure
in
seeing
all
the
details
of
our
first
acquaintance
thus
set
down
alas
even
while
disguising
them
i
was
sorely
afraid
of
offending
you
we
had
no
stories
and
a
without
stories
is
a
beauty
without
hair
not
being
inventive
by
nature
and
in
sheer
despair
i
took
the
only
poetry
in
my
soul
the
only
adventure
in
my
memory
and
pitched
it
in
the
key
in
which
it
would
bear
telling
nor
did
i
ever
cease
to
think
of
you
while
writing
the
only
literary
production
that
will
ever
come
from
my
heart
i
can
not
say
from
my
pen
did
not
the
transformation
of
your
fierce
sormano
into
gina
make
you
laugh
you
ask
after
my
health
well
it
is
better
than
in
paris
though
i
work
enormously
the
peacefulness
of
the
surroundings
has
its
effect
on
the
mind
what
really
tries
and
ages
me
dear
angel
is
the
anguish
of
mortified
vanity
the
perpetual
friction
of
paris
life
the
struggle
of
rival
ambitions
this
peace
is
a
balm
if
you
could
imagine
the
pleasure
your
letter
gives
me
the
long
kind
letter
in
which
you
tell
me
the
most
trivial
incidents
of
your
life
no
you
women
can
never
know
to
what
a
degree
a
true
lover
is
interested
in
these
trifles
it
was
an
immense
pleasure
to
see
the
pattern
of
your
new
dress
can
it
be
a
matter
of
indifference
to
me
to
know
what
you
wear
if
your
lofty
brow
is
knit
if
our
writers
amuse
you
if
canalis
songs
delight
you
i
read
the
books
you
read
even
to
your
boating
on
the
lake
every
incident
touched
me
your
letter
is
as
lovely
as
sweet
as
your
soul
oh
flower
of
heaven
perpetually
adored
could
i
have
lived
without
those
dear
letters
which
for
eleven
years
have
upheld
me
in
my
difficult
path
like
a
light
like
a
perfume
like
a
steady
chant
like
some
divine
nourishment
like
everything
which
can
soothe
and
comfort
life
do
not
fail
me
if
you
knew
what
anxiety
i
suffer
the
day
before
they
are
due
or
the
pain
a
day
s
delay
can
give
me
is
she
ill
is
i
am
midway
between
hell
and
paradise
mia
cara
keep
up
your
music
exercise
your
voice
practise
i
am
enchanted
with
the
coincidence
of
employments
and
hours
by
which
though
separated
by
the
alps
we
live
by
precisely
the
same
rule
the
thought
charms
me
and
gives
me
courage
the
first
time
i
undertook
to
plead
here
i
forget
to
tell
you
this
i
fancied
that
you
were
listening
to
me
and
i
suddenly
felt
the
flash
of
inspiration
which
lifts
the
poet
above
mankind
if
i
am
returned
to
the
chamber
oh
you
must
come
to
paris
to
be
present
at
my
first
appearance
there
evening
good
heavens
how
i
love
you
alas
i
have
intrusted
too
much
to
my
love
and
my
hopes
an
accident
which
should
sink
that
overloaded
bark
would
end
my
life
for
three
years
now
i
have
not
seen
you
and
at
the
thought
of
going
to
belgirate
my
heart
beats
so
wildly
that
i
am
forced
to
to
see
you
to
hear
that
girlish
caressing
voice
to
embrace
in
my
gaze
that
ivory
skin
glistening
under
the
candlelight
and
through
which
i
can
read
your
noble
mind
to
admire
your
fingers
playing
on
the
keys
to
drink
in
your
whole
soul
in
a
look
in
the
tone
of
an
or
an
to
walk
by
the
blossoming
to
live
a
few
months
in
the
bosom
of
that
glorious
scenery
that
is
life
what
folly
it
is
to
run
after
power
a
name
fortune
but
at
belgirate
there
is
everything
there
is
poetry
there
is
glory
i
ought
to
have
made
myself
your
steward
or
as
that
dear
tyrant
whom
we
can
not
hate
proposed
to
me
live
there
as
only
our
passion
was
too
fierce
to
allow
of
it
farewell
my
angel
forgive
me
my
next
fit
of
sadness
in
consideration
of
this
cheerful
mood
it
has
come
as
a
beam
of
light
from
the
torch
of
hope
which
has
hitherto
seemed
to
me
a
how
he
loves
her
cried
rosalie
dropping
the
letter
which
seemed
heavy
in
her
hand
after
eleven
years
to
write
like
this
mariette
said
mademoiselle
de
watteville
to
her
maid
next
morning
go
and
post
this
letter
tell
jerome
that
i
know
all
i
wish
to
know
and
that
he
is
to
serve
monsieur
albert
faithfully
we
will
confess
our
sins
you
and
i
without
saying
to
whom
the
letters
belonged
nor
to
whom
they
were
going
i
was
in
the
wrong
i
alone
am
mademoiselle
has
been
crying
said
mariette
yes
but
i
do
not
want
that
my
mother
should
perceive
it
give
me
some
very
cold
in
the
midst
of
the
storms
of
her
passion
rosalie
often
listened
to
the
voice
of
conscience
touched
by
the
beautiful
fidelity
of
these
two
hearts
she
had
just
said
her
prayers
telling
herself
that
there
was
nothing
left
to
her
but
to
be
resigned
and
to
respect
the
happiness
of
two
beings
worthy
of
each
other
submissive
to
fate
looking
to
god
for
everything
without
allowing
themselves
any
criminal
acts
or
wishes
she
felt
a
better
woman
and
had
a
certain
sense
of
satisfaction
after
coming
to
this
resolution
inspired
by
the
natural
rectitude
of
youth
and
she
was
confirmed
in
it
by
a
girl
s
idea
she
was
sacrificing
herself
for
she
does
not
know
how
to
love
thought
she
ah
if
it
were
i
i
would
give
up
everything
to
a
man
who
loved
me
to
be
loved
when
by
whom
shall
i
be
loved
that
little
monsieur
de
soulas
only
loves
my
money
if
i
were
poor
he
would
not
even
look
at
rosalie
my
child
what
are
you
thinking
about
you
are
working
beyond
the
outline
said
the
baroness
to
her
daughter
who
was
making
slippers
for
the
baron
rosalie
spent
the
winter
of
torn
by
secret
tumults
but
in
the
spring
in
the
month
of
april
when
she
reached
the
age
of
nineteen
she
sometimes
thought
that
it
would
be
a
fine
thing
to
triumph
over
a
duchesse
d
argaiolo
in
silence
and
solitude
the
prospect
of
this
struggle
had
fanned
her
passion
and
her
evil
thoughts
she
encouraged
her
romantic
daring
by
making
plan
after
plan
although
such
characters
are
an
exception
there
are
unfortunately
too
many
rosalies
in
the
world
and
this
story
contains
a
moral
that
ought
to
serve
them
as
a
warning
in
the
course
of
this
winter
albert
de
savarus
had
quietly
made
considerable
progress
in
besancon
confident
of
success
he
now
impatiently
awaited
the
dissolution
of
the
chamber
among
the
men
of
the
moderate
party
he
had
won
the
suffrages
of
one
of
the
makers
of
besancon
a
rich
contractor
who
had
very
wide
influence
wherever
they
settled
the
romans
took
immense
pains
and
spent
enormous
sums
to
have
an
unlimited
supply
of
good
water
in
every
town
of
their
empire
at
besancon
they
drank
the
water
from
arcier
a
hill
at
some
considerable
distance
from
besancon
the
town
stands
in
a
horseshoe
circumscribed
by
the
river
doubs
thus
to
restore
an
aqueduct
in
order
to
drink
the
same
water
that
the
romans
drank
in
a
town
watered
by
the
doubs
is
one
of
those
absurdities
which
only
succeed
in
a
country
place
where
the
most
exemplary
gravity
prevails
if
this
whim
could
be
brought
home
to
the
hearts
of
the
citizens
it
would
lead
to
considerable
outlay
and
this
expenditure
would
benefit
the
influential
contractor
albert
savaron
de
savarus
opined
that
the
water
of
the
river
was
good
for
nothing
but
to
flow
under
the
suspension
bridge
and
that
the
only
drinkable
water
was
that
from
arcier
articles
were
printed
in
the
which
merely
expressed
the
views
of
the
commercial
interest
of
besancon
the
nobility
and
the
citizens
the
moderates
and
the
legitimists
the
government
party
and
the
opposition
everybody
in
short
was
agreed
that
they
must
drink
the
same
water
as
the
romans
and
boast
of
a
suspension
bridge
the
question
of
the
arcier
water
was
the
order
of
the
day
at
besancon
at
besancon
as
in
the
matter
of
the
two
railways
to
versailles
as
for
every
standing
abuse
there
were
private
interests
unconfessed
which
gave
vital
force
to
this
idea
the
reasonable
folk
in
opposition
to
this
scheme
who
were
indeed
but
few
were
regarded
as
old
women
no
one
talked
of
anything
but
of
savaron
s
two
projects
and
thus
after
eighteen
months
of
underground
labor
the
ambitious
lawyer
had
succeeded
in
stirring
to
its
depths
the
most
stagnant
town
in
france
the
most
unyielding
to
foreign
influence
in
finding
the
length
of
its
foot
to
use
a
vulgar
phrase
and
exerting
a
preponderant
influence
without
stirring
from
his
own
room
he
had
solved
the
singular
problem
of
how
to
be
powerful
without
being
popular
in
the
course
of
this
winter
he
won
seven
lawsuits
for
various
priests
of
besancon
at
moments
he
could
breathe
freely
at
the
thought
of
his
coming
triumph
this
intense
desire
which
made
him
work
so
many
interests
and
devise
so
many
springs
absorbed
the
last
strength
of
his
terribly
overstrung
soul
his
disinterestedness
was
lauded
and
he
took
his
clients
fees
without
comment
but
this
disinterestedness
was
in
truth
moral
usury
he
counted
on
a
reward
far
greater
to
him
than
all
the
gold
in
the
world
in
the
month
of
october
he
had
brought
ostensibly
to
serve
a
merchant
who
was
in
difficulties
with
money
lent
him
by
leopold
hannequin
a
house
which
gave
him
a
qualification
for
election
he
had
not
seemed
to
seek
or
desire
this
advantageous
bargain
you
are
really
a
remarkable
man
said
the
abbe
de
grancey
who
of
course
had
watched
and
understood
the
lawyer
the
had
come
to
introduce
to
him
a
canon
who
needed
his
professional
advice
you
are
a
priest
who
has
taken
the
wrong
this
observation
struck
savarus
rosalie
on
her
part
had
made
up
her
mind
in
her
strong
girl
s
head
to
get
monsieur
de
savarus
into
the
and
acquainted
with
the
society
of
the
hotel
de
rupt
so
far
she
had
limited
her
desires
to
seeing
and
hearing
albert
she
had
compounded
so
to
speak
and
a
composition
is
often
no
more
than
a
truce
les
rouxey
the
inherited
estate
of
the
wattevilles
was
worth
just
ten
thousand
francs
a
year
but
in
other
hands
it
would
have
yielded
a
great
deal
more
the
baron
in
his
indifference
for
his
wife
was
to
have
and
in
fact
had
forty
thousand
francs
a
year
left
the
management
of
les
rouxey
to
a
sort
of
factotum
an
old
servant
of
the
wattevilles
named
modinier
nevertheless
whenever
the
baron
and
his
wife
wished
to
go
out
of
the
town
they
went
to
les
rouxey
which
is
very
picturesquely
situated
the
chateau
and
the
park
were
in
fact
created
by
the
famous
watteville
who
in
his
active
old
age
was
passionately
attached
to
this
magnificent
spot
between
two
precipitous
hills
little
peaks
with
bare
summits
known
as
the
great
and
the
little
rouxey
in
the
heart
of
a
ravine
where
the
torrents
from
the
heights
with
the
dent
de
vilard
at
their
head
come
tumbling
to
join
the
lovely
upper
waters
of
the
doubs
watteville
had
a
huge
dam
constructed
leaving
two
cuttings
for
the
overflow
above
this
dam
he
made
a
beautiful
lake
and
below
it
two
cascades
and
these
uniting
a
few
yards
below
the
falls
formed
a
lovely
little
river
to
irrigate
the
barren
uncultivated
valley
and
these
two
hills
he
enclosed
in
a
ring
fence
and
built
himself
a
retreat
on
the
dam
which
he
widened
to
two
acres
by
accumulating
above
it
all
the
soil
which
had
to
be
removed
to
make
a
channel
for
the
river
and
the
irrigation
canals
when
the
baron
de
watteville
thus
obtained
the
lake
above
his
dam
he
was
owner
of
the
two
hills
but
not
of
the
upper
valley
thus
flooded
through
which
there
had
been
at
all
times
a
to
where
it
ends
in
a
horseshoe
under
the
dent
de
vilard
but
this
ferocious
old
man
was
so
widely
dreaded
that
so
long
as
he
lived
no
claim
was
urged
by
the
inhabitants
of
riceys
the
little
village
on
the
further
side
of
the
dent
de
vilard
when
the
baron
died
he
left
the
slopes
of
the
two
rouxey
hills
joined
by
a
strong
wall
to
protect
from
inundation
the
two
lateral
valleys
opening
into
the
valley
of
rouxey
to
the
right
and
left
at
the
foot
of
the
dent
de
vilard
thus
he
died
the
master
of
the
dent
de
vilard
his
heirs
asserted
their
protectorate
of
the
village
of
riceys
and
so
maintained
the
usurpation
the
old
assassin
the
old
renegade
the
old
abbe
watteville
ended
his
career
by
planting
trees
and
making
a
fine
road
over
the
shoulder
of
one
of
the
rouxey
hills
to
join
the
highroad
the
estate
belonging
to
this
park
and
house
was
extensive
but
badly
cultivated
there
were
chalets
on
both
hills
and
neglected
forests
of
timber
it
was
all
wild
and
deserted
left
to
the
care
of
nature
abandoned
to
chance
growths
but
full
of
sublime
and
unexpected
beauty
you
may
now
imagine
les
rouxey
it
is
unnecessary
to
complicate
this
story
by
relating
all
the
prodigious
trouble
and
the
inventiveness
stamped
with
genius
by
which
rosalie
achieved
her
end
without
allowing
it
to
be
suspected
it
is
enough
to
say
that
it
was
in
obedience
to
her
mother
that
she
left
besancon
in
the
month
of
may
in
an
antique
traveling
carriage
drawn
by
a
pair
of
sturdy
hired
horses
and
accompanied
her
father
to
les
rouxey
to
a
young
girl
love
lurks
in
everything
when
she
rose
the
morning
after
her
arrival
mademoiselle
de
watteville
saw
from
her
bedroom
window
the
fine
expanse
of
water
from
which
the
light
mists
rose
like
smoke
and
were
caught
in
the
firs
and
larches
rolling
up
and
along
the
hills
till
they
reached
the
heights
and
she
gave
a
cry
of
admiration
they
loved
by
the
lakes
lives
by
a
lake
a
lake
is
certainly
full
of
love
she
thought
a
lake
fed
by
snows
has
opalescent
colors
and
a
translucency
that
makes
it
one
huge
diamond
but
when
it
is
shut
in
like
that
of
les
rouxey
between
two
granite
masses
covered
with
pines
when
silence
broods
over
it
like
that
of
the
savannas
or
the
steppes
then
every
one
must
exclaim
as
rosalie
did
we
owe
that
said
her
father
to
the
notorious
on
my
word
said
the
girl
he
did
his
best
to
earn
forgiveness
let
us
go
in
a
boat
to
the
further
end
it
will
give
us
an
appetite
for
the
baron
called
two
gardener
lads
who
knew
how
to
row
and
took
with
him
his
prime
minister
modinier
the
lake
was
about
six
acres
in
breadth
in
some
places
ten
or
twelve
and
four
hundred
in
length
rosalie
soon
found
herself
at
the
upper
end
shut
in
by
the
dent
de
vilard
the
jungfrau
of
that
little
switzerland
here
we
are
monsieur
le
baron
said
modinier
signing
to
the
gardeners
to
tie
up
the
boat
will
you
come
and
look
look
at
what
asked
rosalie
oh
nothing
exclaimed
the
baron
but
you
are
a
sensible
girl
we
have
some
little
secrets
between
us
and
i
may
tell
you
what
ruffles
my
mind
some
difficulties
have
arisen
since
between
the
village
authorities
of
riceys
and
me
on
account
of
this
very
dent
de
vilard
and
i
want
to
settle
the
matter
without
your
mother
s
knowing
anything
about
it
for
she
is
stubborn
she
is
capable
of
flinging
fire
and
flames
broadcast
particularly
if
she
should
hear
that
the
mayor
of
riceys
a
republican
got
up
this
action
as
a
sop
to
his
rosalie
had
presence
of
mind
enough
to
disguise
her
delight
so
as
to
work
more
effectually
on
her
father
what
action
said
she
mademoiselle
the
people
of
riceys
said
modinier
have
long
enjoyed
the
right
of
grazing
and
cutting
fodder
on
their
side
of
the
dent
de
vilard
now
monsieur
chantonnit
the
maire
since
declares
that
the
whole
dent
belongs
to
his
district
and
maintains
that
a
hundred
years
ago
or
more
there
was
a
way
through
our
grounds
you
understand
that
in
that
case
we
should
no
longer
have
them
to
ourselves
then
this
barbarian
would
end
by
saying
what
the
old
men
in
the
village
say
that
the
ground
occupied
by
the
lake
was
appropriated
by
the
abbe
de
watteville
that
would
be
the
end
of
les
rouxey
what
next
indeed
my
child
between
ourselves
it
is
the
truth
said
monsieur
de
watteville
simply
the
land
is
an
usurpation
with
no
but
lapse
of
time
and
therefore
to
avoid
all
worry
i
should
wish
to
come
to
a
friendly
understanding
as
to
my
border
line
on
this
side
of
the
dent
de
vilard
and
i
will
then
raise
a
if
you
give
way
to
the
municipality
it
will
swallow
you
up
you
ought
to
have
threatened
that
is
just
what
i
told
the
master
last
evening
said
modinier
but
in
confirmation
of
that
view
i
proposed
that
he
should
come
to
see
whether
on
this
side
of
the
dent
or
on
the
other
there
may
not
be
high
or
low
some
traces
of
an
for
a
century
the
dent
de
vilard
had
been
used
by
both
parties
without
coming
to
extremities
it
stood
as
a
sort
of
party
wall
between
the
communes
of
riceys
and
les
rouxey
yielding
little
profit
indeed
the
object
in
dispute
being
covered
with
snow
for
six
months
in
the
year
was
of
a
nature
to
cool
their
ardor
thus
it
required
all
the
hot
blast
by
which
the
revolution
of
inflamed
the
advocates
of
the
people
to
stir
up
this
matter
by
which
monsieur
chantonnit
the
maire
of
riceys
hoped
to
give
a
dramatic
turn
to
his
career
on
the
peaceful
frontier
of
switzerland
and
to
immortalize
his
term
of
office
chantonnit
as
his
name
shows
was
a
native
of
neuchatel
my
dear
father
said
rosalie
as
they
got
into
the
boat
again
i
agree
with
modinier
if
you
wish
to
secure
the
joint
possession
of
the
dent
de
vilard
you
must
act
with
decision
and
get
a
legal
opinion
which
will
protect
you
against
this
enterprising
chantonnit
why
should
you
be
afraid
get
the
famous
lawyer
savaron
engage
him
at
once
lest
chantonnit
should
place
the
interests
of
the
village
in
his
hands
the
man
who
won
the
case
for
the
chapter
against
the
town
can
certainly
win
that
of
watteville
riceys
besides
she
added
les
rouxey
will
some
day
be
mine
not
for
a
long
time
yet
i
well
then
do
not
leave
me
with
a
lawsuit
on
my
hands
i
like
this
place
i
shall
often
live
here
and
add
to
it
as
much
as
possible
on
those
banks
and
she
pointed
to
the
feet
of
the
two
hills
i
shall
cut
flowerbeds
and
make
the
loveliest
english
gardens
let
us
go
to
besancon
and
bring
back
with
us
the
abbe
de
grancey
monsieur
savaron
and
my
mother
if
she
cares
to
come
you
can
then
make
up
your
mind
but
in
your
place
i
should
have
done
so
already
your
name
is
watteville
and
you
are
afraid
of
a
fight
if
you
should
lose
your
case
well
i
will
never
reproach
you
by
a
word
oh
if
that
is
the
way
you
take
it
said
the
baron
i
am
quite
ready
i
will
see
the
besides
a
lawsuit
is
really
great
fun
it
brings
some
interest
into
life
with
coming
and
going
and
raging
over
it
you
will
have
a
great
deal
to
do
before
you
can
get
hold
of
the
we
did
not
see
the
abbe
de
grancey
for
three
weeks
he
was
so
busy
but
the
very
existence
of
the
chapter
was
involved
said
monsieur
de
watteville
and
then
the
archbishop
s
pride
his
conscience
everything
that
makes
up
the
life
of
the
priesthood
was
at
stake
that
savaron
does
not
know
what
he
did
for
the
chapter
he
saved
it
listen
to
me
said
his
daughter
in
his
ear
if
you
secure
monsieur
de
savaron
you
will
gain
your
suit
won
t
you
well
then
let
me
advise
you
you
can
not
get
at
monsieur
savaron
excepting
through
monsieur
de
grancey
take
my
word
for
it
and
let
us
together
talk
to
the
dear
abbe
without
my
mother
s
presence
at
the
interview
for
i
know
a
way
of
persuading
him
to
bring
the
lawyer
to
it
will
be
very
difficult
to
avoid
mentioning
it
to
your
mother
the
abbe
de
grancey
will
settle
that
afterwards
but
just
make
up
your
mind
to
promise
your
vote
to
monsieur
savaron
at
the
next
election
and
you
will
see
go
to
the
election
take
the
oath
cried
the
baron
de
watteville
what
then
said
she
and
what
will
your
mother
say
she
may
even
desire
you
to
do
it
replied
rosalie
knowing
as
she
did
from
albert
s
letter
to
leopold
how
deeply
the
had
pledged
himself
four
days
after
the
abbe
de
grancey
called
very
early
one
morning
on
albert
de
savarus
having
announced
his
visit
the
day
before
the
old
priest
had
come
to
win
over
the
great
lawyer
to
the
house
of
the
wattevilles
a
proceeding
which
shows
how
much
tact
and
subtlety
rosalie
must
have
employed
in
an
underhand
way
what
can
i
do
for
you
monsieur
le
asked
savarus
the
abbe
who
told
his
story
with
admirable
frankness
was
coldly
heard
by
albert
monsieur
l
abbe
said
he
it
is
out
of
the
question
that
i
should
defend
the
interests
of
the
wattevilles
and
you
shall
understand
why
my
part
in
this
town
is
to
remain
perfectly
neutral
i
will
display
no
colors
i
must
remain
a
mystery
till
the
eve
of
my
election
now
to
plead
for
the
wattevilles
would
mean
nothing
in
paris
but
here
here
where
everything
is
discussed
i
should
be
supposed
by
every
one
to
be
an
ally
of
your
faubourg
what
do
you
suppose
that
you
can
remain
unknown
on
the
day
of
the
election
when
the
candidates
must
oppose
each
other
it
must
then
become
known
that
your
name
is
savaron
de
savarus
that
you
have
held
the
appointment
of
master
of
appeals
that
you
are
a
man
of
the
restoration
on
the
day
of
the
election
said
savarus
i
will
be
all
i
am
expected
to
be
and
i
intend
to
speak
at
the
preliminary
if
you
have
the
support
of
monsieur
de
watteville
and
his
party
you
will
get
a
hundred
votes
in
a
mass
and
far
more
to
be
trusted
than
those
on
which
you
rely
it
is
always
possible
to
produce
division
of
interests
convictions
are
the
deuce
is
in
it
said
savarus
i
am
attached
to
you
and
i
could
do
a
great
deal
for
you
father
perhaps
we
may
compound
with
the
devil
whatever
monsieur
de
watteville
s
business
may
be
by
engaging
girardet
and
prompting
him
it
will
be
possible
to
drag
the
proceedings
out
till
the
elections
are
over
i
will
not
undertake
to
plead
till
the
day
after
i
am
do
this
one
thing
said
the
abbe
come
to
the
hotel
de
rupt
there
is
a
young
person
of
nineteen
there
who
one
of
these
days
will
have
a
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
and
you
can
seem
to
be
paying
your
court
to
her
ah
the
young
lady
i
sometimes
see
in
the
kiosk
yes
mademoiselle
rosalie
replied
the
abbe
de
grancey
you
are
ambitious
if
she
takes
a
fancy
to
you
you
may
be
everything
an
ambitious
man
can
wish
who
knows
a
minister
perhaps
a
man
can
always
be
a
minister
who
adds
a
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
to
your
amazing
monsieur
l
abbe
if
mademoiselle
de
watteville
had
three
times
her
fortune
and
adored
me
into
the
bargain
it
would
be
impossible
that
i
should
marry
her
you
are
married
exclaimed
the
abbe
not
in
church
nor
before
the
maire
but
morally
speaking
said
savarus
that
is
even
worse
when
a
man
cares
about
it
as
you
seem
to
care
replied
the
abbe
everything
that
is
not
done
can
be
undone
do
not
stake
your
fortune
and
your
prospects
on
a
woman
s
liking
any
more
than
a
wise
man
counts
on
a
dead
man
s
shoes
before
starting
on
his
let
us
say
no
more
about
mademoiselle
de
watteville
said
albert
gravely
and
agree
as
to
the
facts
at
your
desire
for
i
have
a
regard
and
respect
for
you
i
will
appear
for
monsieur
de
watteville
but
after
the
elections
until
then
girardet
must
conduct
the
case
under
my
instructions
that
is
the
most
i
can
but
there
are
questions
involved
which
can
only
be
settled
after
inspection
of
the
localities
said
the
girardet
can
go
said
savarus
i
can
not
allow
myself
in
the
face
of
a
town
i
know
so
well
to
take
any
step
which
might
compromise
the
supreme
interests
that
lie
beyond
my
the
abbe
left
savarus
after
giving
him
a
keen
look
in
which
he
seemed
to
be
laughing
at
the
young
athlete
s
uncompromising
politics
while
admiring
his
firmness
ah
i
would
have
dragged
my
father
into
a
lawsuit
i
would
have
done
anything
to
get
him
here
cried
rosalie
to
herself
standing
in
the
kiosk
and
looking
at
the
lawyer
in
his
room
the
day
after
albert
s
interview
with
the
abbe
who
had
reported
the
result
to
her
father
i
would
have
committed
any
mortal
sin
and
you
will
not
enter
the
wattevilles
i
may
not
hear
your
fine
voice
you
make
conditions
when
your
help
is
required
by
the
wattevilles
and
the
rupts
well
god
knows
i
meant
to
be
content
with
these
small
joys
with
seeing
you
hearing
you
speak
going
with
you
to
les
rouxey
that
your
presence
might
to
me
make
the
place
sacred
that
was
all
i
asked
but
now
now
i
mean
to
be
your
yes
yes
look
at
portrait
at
bedroom
at
the
four
sides
of
villa
the
points
of
view
from
gardens
you
expect
her
statue
i
will
make
her
marble
herself
towards
you
after
all
the
woman
does
not
love
art
science
books
singing
music
have
absorbed
half
her
senses
and
her
intelligence
she
is
old
too
she
is
past
thirty
my
albert
will
not
be
happy
what
is
the
matter
that
you
stay
here
rosalie
asked
her
mother
interrupting
her
reflections
monsieur
de
soulas
is
in
the
and
he
observed
your
attitude
which
certainly
betrays
more
thoughtfulness
than
is
due
at
your
then
is
monsieur
de
soulas
a
foe
to
thought
asked
rosalie
then
you
were
thinking
said
madame
de
watteville
why
yes
why
no
you
were
not
thinking
you
were
staring
at
that
lawyer
s
window
with
an
attention
that
is
neither
becoming
nor
decent
and
which
monsieur
de
soulas
of
all
men
ought
never
to
have
why
said
rosalie
it
is
time
said
the
baroness
that
you
should
know
what
our
intentions
are
amedee
likes
you
and
you
will
not
be
unhappy
as
comtesse
de
rosalie
as
white
as
a
lily
made
no
reply
so
completely
was
she
stupefied
by
contending
feelings
and
yet
in
the
presence
of
the
man
she
had
this
instant
begun
to
hate
vehemently
she
forced
the
kind
of
smile
which
a
puts
on
for
the
public
nay
she
could
even
laugh
she
had
the
strength
to
conceal
her
rage
which
presently
subsided
for
she
was
determined
to
make
use
of
this
fat
simpleton
to
further
her
designs
monsieur
amedee
said
she
at
the
moment
when
her
mother
was
walking
ahead
of
them
in
the
garden
affecting
to
leave
the
young
people
together
were
you
not
aware
that
monsieur
albert
savaron
de
savarus
is
a
legitimist
a
legitimist
until
he
was
master
of
appeals
to
the
council
of
state
attached
to
the
supreme
ministerial
council
and
in
favor
with
the
dauphin
and
dauphiness
it
would
be
very
good
of
you
to
say
nothing
against
him
but
it
would
be
better
still
if
you
would
attend
the
election
this
year
carry
the
day
and
hinder
that
poor
monsieur
de
chavoncourt
from
representing
the
town
of
what
sudden
interest
have
you
in
this
savaron
monsieur
albert
savaron
de
savarus
the
natural
son
of
the
comte
de
savarus
pray
keep
the
secret
of
my
indiscretion
if
he
is
returned
deputy
will
be
our
advocate
in
the
suit
about
les
rouxey
les
rouxey
my
father
tells
me
will
be
my
property
i
intend
to
live
there
it
is
a
lovely
place
i
should
be
at
seeing
that
fine
piece
of
the
great
de
watteville
s
work
the
devil
thought
amedee
as
he
left
the
house
the
heiress
is
not
such
a
fool
as
her
mother
thinks
monsieur
de
chavoncourt
is
a
royalist
of
the
famous
hence
from
the
day
after
the
revolution
of
july
he
always
preached
the
salutary
doctrine
of
taking
the
oaths
and
resisting
the
present
order
of
things
after
the
pattern
of
the
tories
against
the
whigs
in
england
this
doctrine
was
not
acceptable
to
the
legitimists
who
in
their
defeat
had
the
wit
to
divide
in
their
opinions
and
to
trust
to
the
force
of
inertia
and
to
providence
monsieur
de
chavoncourt
was
not
wholly
trusted
by
his
own
party
but
seemed
to
the
moderates
the
best
man
to
choose
they
preferred
the
triumph
of
his
opinions
to
the
acclamation
of
a
republican
who
should
combine
the
votes
of
the
enthusiasts
and
the
patriots
monsieur
de
chavoncourt
highly
respected
in
besancon
was
the
representative
of
an
old
parliamentary
family
his
fortune
of
about
fifteen
thousand
francs
a
year
was
not
an
offence
to
anybody
especially
as
he
had
a
son
and
three
daughters
with
such
a
family
fifteen
thousand
francs
a
year
are
a
mere
nothing
now
when
under
these
circumstances
the
father
of
the
family
is
above
bribery
it
would
be
hard
if
the
electors
did
not
esteem
him
electors
wax
enthusiastic
over
a
of
parliamentary
virtue
just
as
the
audience
in
the
pit
do
at
the
representation
of
the
generous
sentiments
they
so
little
practise
madame
de
chavoncourt
at
this
time
a
woman
of
forty
was
one
of
the
beauties
of
besancon
while
the
chamber
was
sitting
she
lived
meagrely
in
one
of
their
country
places
to
recoup
herself
by
economy
for
monsieur
de
chavoncourt
s
expenses
in
paris
in
the
winter
she
received
very
creditably
once
a
week
on
tuesdays
understanding
her
business
as
mistress
of
the
house
young
chavoncourt
a
youth
of
and
another
young
gentleman
named
monsieur
de
vauchelles
no
richer
than
amedee
and
his
were
his
intimate
allies
they
made
excursions
together
to
granvelle
and
sometimes
went
out
shooting
they
were
so
well
known
to
be
inseparable
that
they
were
invited
to
the
country
together
rosalie
who
was
intimate
with
the
chavoncourt
girls
knew
that
the
three
young
men
had
no
secrets
from
each
other
she
reflected
that
if
monsieur
de
soulas
should
repeat
her
words
it
would
be
to
his
two
companions
now
monsieur
de
vauchelles
had
his
matrimonial
plans
as
amedee
had
his
he
wished
to
marry
victoire
the
eldest
of
the
chavoncourts
on
whom
an
old
aunt
was
to
settle
an
estate
worth
seven
thousand
francs
a
year
and
a
hundred
thousand
francs
in
hard
cash
when
the
contract
was
to
be
signed
victoire
was
this
aunt
s
and
favorite
niece
consequently
young
chavoncourt
and
his
friend
vauchelles
would
be
sure
to
warn
monsieur
de
chavoncourt
of
the
danger
he
was
in
from
albert
s
candidature
but
this
did
not
satisfy
rosalie
she
sent
the
prefet
of
the
department
a
letter
written
with
her
left
hand
signed
friend
to
louis
in
which
she
informed
him
of
the
secret
intentions
of
monsieur
albert
de
savarus
pointing
out
the
serious
support
a
royalist
orator
might
give
to
berryer
and
revealing
to
him
the
deeply
artful
course
pursued
by
the
lawyer
during
his
two
years
residence
at
besancon
the
prefet
was
a
capable
man
a
personal
enemy
of
the
royalist
party
devoted
by
conviction
to
the
government
of
july
in
short
one
of
those
men
of
whom
in
the
rue
de
grenelle
the
minister
of
the
interior
could
say
we
have
a
capital
prefet
at
the
prefet
read
the
letter
and
in
obedience
to
its
instructions
he
burnt
it
rosalie
aimed
at
preventing
albert
s
election
so
as
to
keep
him
five
years
longer
at
besancon
at
that
time
an
election
was
a
fight
between
parties
and
in
order
to
win
the
ministry
chose
its
ground
by
choosing
the
moment
when
it
would
give
battle
the
elections
were
therefore
not
to
take
place
for
three
months
yet
when
a
man
s
whole
life
depends
on
an
election
the
period
that
elapses
between
the
issuing
of
the
writs
for
convening
the
electoral
bodies
and
the
day
fixed
for
their
meetings
is
an
interval
during
which
ordinary
vitality
is
suspended
rosalie
fully
understood
how
much
latitude
albert
s
absorbed
state
would
leave
her
during
these
three
months
by
promising
mariette
as
she
afterwards
confessed
to
take
both
her
and
jerome
into
her
service
she
induced
the
maid
to
bring
her
all
the
letters
albert
might
sent
to
italy
and
those
addressed
to
him
from
that
country
and
all
the
time
she
was
pondering
these
machinations
the
extraordinary
girl
was
working
slippers
for
her
father
with
the
most
innocent
air
in
the
world
she
even
made
a
greater
display
than
ever
of
candor
and
simplicity
quite
understanding
how
valuable
that
candor
and
innocence
would
be
to
her
ends
my
daughter
grows
quite
charming
said
madame
de
watteville
two
months
before
the
election
a
meeting
was
held
at
the
house
of
monsieur
boucher
senior
composed
of
the
contractor
who
expected
to
get
the
work
for
the
aqueduct
for
the
arcier
waters
of
monsieur
boucher
s
of
monsieur
granet
the
influential
man
to
whom
savarus
had
done
a
service
and
who
was
to
nominate
him
as
a
candidate
of
girardet
the
lawyer
of
the
printer
of
the
and
of
the
president
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
in
fact
the
assembly
consisted
of
persons
in
all
men
who
in
the
provinces
are
regarded
as
bigwigs
each
man
represented
on
an
average
six
votes
but
in
estimating
their
values
they
said
ten
for
men
always
begin
by
exaggerating
their
own
influence
among
these
was
one
who
was
wholly
devoted
to
the
prefet
one
false
brother
who
secretly
looked
for
some
favor
from
the
ministry
either
for
himself
or
for
some
one
belonging
to
him
at
this
preliminary
meeting
it
was
agreed
that
savaron
the
lawyer
should
be
named
as
candidate
a
motion
received
with
such
enthusiasm
as
no
one
looked
for
from
besancon
albert
waiting
at
home
for
alfred
boucher
to
fetch
him
was
chatting
with
the
abbe
de
grancey
who
was
interested
in
this
absorbing
ambition
albert
had
appreciated
the
priest
s
vast
political
capacities
and
the
priest
touched
by
the
young
man
s
entreaties
had
been
willing
to
become
his
guide
and
adviser
in
this
culminating
struggle
the
chapter
did
not
love
monsieur
de
chavoncourt
for
it
was
his
wife
s
as
president
of
the
tribunal
who
had
lost
the
famous
suit
for
them
in
the
lower
court
you
are
betrayed
my
dear
fellow
said
the
shrewd
and
worthy
abbe
in
that
gentle
calm
voice
which
old
priests
acquire
betrayed
cried
the
lover
struck
to
the
heart
by
whom
i
know
not
at
all
the
priest
replied
but
at
the
prefecture
your
plans
are
known
and
your
hand
read
like
a
book
at
this
moment
i
have
no
advice
to
give
you
such
affairs
need
consideration
as
for
this
evening
take
the
bull
by
the
horns
anticipate
the
blow
tell
them
all
your
previous
life
and
thus
you
will
mitigate
the
effect
of
the
discovery
on
the
good
folks
of
oh
i
was
prepared
for
it
said
albert
in
a
broken
voice
you
would
not
benefit
by
my
advice
you
had
the
opportunity
of
making
an
impression
at
the
hotel
de
rupt
you
do
not
know
the
advantage
you
would
have
gained
what
the
unanimous
support
of
the
royalists
an
immediate
readiness
to
go
to
the
election
in
short
above
a
hundred
votes
adding
to
these
what
among
ourselves
we
call
the
ecclesiastical
vote
though
you
were
not
yet
nominated
you
were
master
of
the
votes
by
ballot
under
such
circumstances
a
man
may
temporize
may
make
his
way
alfred
boucher
when
he
came
in
full
of
enthusiasm
to
announce
the
decision
of
the
preliminary
meeting
found
the
and
the
lawyer
cold
calm
and
grave
monsieur
l
abbe
said
albert
we
will
talk
of
your
business
at
greater
length
when
the
elections
are
and
he
took
alfred
s
arm
after
pressing
monsieur
de
grancey
s
hand
with
meaning
the
priest
looked
at
the
ambitious
man
whose
face
at
that
moment
wore
the
lofty
expression
which
a
general
may
have
when
he
hears
the
first
gun
fired
for
a
battle
he
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
and
left
the
room
saying
to
himself
what
a
priest
he
would
make
eloquence
is
not
at
the
bar
the
pleader
rarely
puts
forth
the
real
powers
of
his
soul
if
he
did
he
would
die
of
it
in
a
few
years
eloquence
is
nowadays
rarely
in
the
pulpit
but
it
is
found
on
certain
occasions
in
the
chamber
of
deputies
when
an
ambitious
man
stakes
all
to
win
all
or
stung
by
a
myriad
darts
at
a
given
moment
bursts
into
speech
but
it
is
still
more
certainly
found
in
some
privileged
beings
at
the
inevitable
hour
when
their
claims
must
either
triumph
or
be
wrecked
and
when
they
are
forced
to
speak
thus
at
this
meeting
albert
savarus
feeling
the
necessity
of
winning
himself
some
supporters
displayed
all
the
faculties
of
his
soul
and
the
resources
of
his
intellect
he
entered
the
room
well
without
awkwardness
or
arrogance
without
weakness
without
cowardice
quite
gravely
and
was
not
dismayed
at
finding
himself
among
twenty
or
thirty
men
the
news
of
the
meeting
and
of
its
determination
had
already
brought
a
few
docile
sheep
to
follow
the
bell
before
listening
to
monsieur
boucher
who
was
about
to
deluge
him
with
a
speech
announcing
the
decision
of
the
boucher
committee
albert
begged
for
silence
and
as
he
shook
hands
with
monsieur
boucher
tried
to
warn
him
by
a
sign
of
an
unexpected
danger
my
young
friend
alfred
boucher
has
just
announced
to
me
the
honor
you
have
done
me
but
before
that
decision
is
irrevocable
said
the
lawyer
i
think
that
i
ought
to
explain
to
you
who
and
what
your
candidate
is
so
as
to
leave
you
free
to
take
back
your
word
if
my
declaration
should
disturb
your
conscience
this
exordium
was
followed
by
profound
silence
some
of
the
men
thought
it
showed
a
noble
impulse
albert
gave
a
sketch
of
his
previous
career
telling
them
his
real
name
his
action
under
the
restoration
and
revealing
himself
as
a
new
man
since
his
arrival
at
besancon
while
pledging
himself
for
the
future
this
address
held
his
hearers
breathless
it
was
said
these
men
all
with
different
interests
were
spellbound
by
the
brilliant
eloquence
that
flowed
at
boiling
heat
from
the
heart
and
soul
of
this
ambitious
spirit
admiration
silenced
reflection
only
one
thing
was
clear
the
thing
which
albert
wished
to
get
into
their
heads
was
it
not
far
better
for
the
town
to
have
one
of
those
men
who
are
born
to
govern
society
at
large
than
a
mere
a
statesman
carries
power
with
him
a
commonplace
deputy
however
incorruptible
is
but
a
conscience
what
a
glory
for
provence
to
have
found
a
mirabeau
to
return
the
only
statesman
since
that
the
revolution
of
july
had
produced
under
the
pressure
of
this
eloquence
all
the
audience
believed
it
great
enough
to
become
a
splendid
political
instrument
in
the
hands
of
their
representative
they
all
saw
in
albert
savaron
savarus
the
great
minister
and
reading
the
secret
calculations
of
his
constituents
the
clever
candidate
gave
them
to
understand
that
they
would
be
the
first
to
enjoy
the
right
of
profiting
by
his
influence
this
confession
of
faith
this
ambitious
programme
this
retrospect
of
his
life
and
character
was
according
to
the
only
man
present
who
was
capable
of
judging
of
savarus
he
has
since
become
one
of
the
leading
men
of
besancon
a
masterpiece
of
skill
and
of
feeling
of
fervor
interest
and
fascination
this
whirlwind
carried
away
the
electors
never
had
any
man
had
such
a
triumph
but
unfortunately
speech
a
weapon
only
for
close
warfare
has
only
an
immediate
effect
reflection
kills
the
word
when
the
word
ceases
to
overpower
reflection
if
the
votes
had
then
been
taken
albert
s
name
would
undoubtedly
have
come
out
of
the
at
the
moment
he
was
conqueror
but
he
must
conquer
every
day
for
two
months
albert
went
home
quivering
the
townsfolk
had
applauded
him
and
he
had
achieved
the
great
point
of
silencing
beforehand
the
malignant
talk
to
which
his
early
career
might
give
rise
the
commercial
interest
of
besancon
had
nominated
the
lawyer
albert
savaron
de
savarus
as
its
candidate
alfred
boucher
s
enthusiasm
at
first
infectious
presently
became
blundering
the
prefet
alarmed
by
this
success
set
to
work
to
count
the
ministerial
votes
and
contrived
to
have
a
secret
interview
with
monsieur
de
chavoncourt
so
as
to
effect
a
coalition
in
their
common
interests
every
day
without
albert
s
being
able
to
discover
how
the
voters
in
the
boucher
committee
diminished
in
number
nothing
could
resist
the
slow
grinding
of
the
prefecture
three
of
four
clever
men
would
say
to
albert
s
clients
will
the
deputy
defend
you
and
win
your
lawsuits
will
he
give
you
advice
draw
up
your
contracts
arrange
your
compromises
he
will
be
your
slave
for
five
years
longer
if
instead
of
returning
him
to
the
chamber
you
only
hold
out
the
hope
of
his
going
there
five
years
this
calculation
did
savarus
all
the
more
mischief
because
the
wives
of
some
of
the
merchants
had
already
made
it
the
parties
interested
in
the
matter
of
the
bridge
and
that
of
the
water
from
arcier
could
not
hold
out
against
a
from
a
clever
ministerialist
who
proved
to
them
that
their
safety
lay
at
the
prefecture
and
not
in
the
hands
of
an
ambitious
man
each
day
was
a
check
for
savarus
though
each
day
the
battle
was
led
by
him
and
fought
by
his
lieutenants
a
battle
of
words
speeches
and
proceedings
he
dared
not
go
to
the
and
the
never
showed
himself
albert
rose
and
went
to
bed
in
a
fever
his
brain
on
fire
at
last
the
day
dawned
of
the
first
struggle
practically
the
show
of
hands
the
votes
are
counted
the
candidates
estimate
their
chances
and
clever
men
can
prophesy
their
failure
or
success
it
is
a
decent
hustings
without
the
mob
but
formidable
agitation
though
it
is
not
allowed
any
physical
display
as
it
is
in
england
is
not
the
less
profound
the
english
fight
these
battles
with
their
fists
the
french
with
hard
words
our
neighbors
have
a
scrimmage
the
french
try
their
fate
by
cold
combinations
calmly
worked
out
this
particular
political
business
is
carried
out
in
opposition
to
the
character
of
the
two
nations
the
radical
party
named
their
candidate
monsieur
de
chavoncourt
came
forward
then
albert
appeared
and
was
accused
by
the
chavoncourt
committee
and
the
radicals
of
being
an
uncompromising
man
of
the
right
a
second
berryer
the
ministry
had
their
candidate
a
useful
only
to
receive
the
purely
ministerial
votes
the
votes
thus
divided
gave
no
result
the
republican
candidate
had
twenty
the
ministry
got
fifty
albert
had
seventy
monsieur
de
chavoncourt
obtained
but
the
prefet
s
party
had
perfidiously
made
thirty
of
its
most
devoted
adherents
vote
for
albert
so
as
to
deceive
the
enemy
the
votes
for
monsieur
de
chavoncourt
added
to
the
eighty
votes
the
real
number
at
the
disposal
of
the
prefecture
would
carry
the
election
if
only
the
prefet
could
succeed
in
gaining
over
a
few
of
the
radicals
a
hundred
and
sixty
votes
were
not
recorded
those
of
monsieur
de
grancey
s
following
and
the
legitimists
the
show
of
hands
at
an
election
like
a
dress
rehearsal
at
a
theatre
is
the
most
deceptive
thing
in
the
world
albert
savarus
came
home
putting
a
brave
face
on
the
matter
but
half
dead
he
had
had
the
wit
the
genius
or
the
good
luck
to
gain
within
the
last
fortnight
two
staunch
supporters
girardet
s
and
a
very
shrewd
old
merchant
to
whom
monsieur
de
grancey
had
sent
him
these
two
worthy
men
his
spies
affected
to
be
albert
s
most
ardent
opponents
in
the
hostile
camp
towards
the
end
of
the
show
of
hands
they
informed
savarus
through
the
medium
of
monsieur
boucher
that
thirty
voters
unknown
were
working
against
him
in
his
party
playing
the
same
trick
that
they
were
playing
for
his
benefit
on
the
other
side
a
criminal
marching
to
execution
could
not
suffer
as
albert
suffered
as
he
went
home
from
the
hall
where
his
fate
was
at
stake
the
despairing
lover
could
endure
no
companionship
he
walked
through
the
streets
alone
between
eleven
o
clock
and
midnight
at
one
in
the
morning
albert
to
whom
sleep
had
been
unknown
for
the
past
three
days
was
sitting
in
his
library
in
a
deep
armchair
his
face
as
pale
as
if
he
were
dying
his
hands
hanging
limp
in
a
forlorn
attitude
worthy
of
the
magdalen
tears
hung
on
his
long
lashes
tears
that
dim
the
eyes
but
do
not
fall
fierce
thought
drinks
them
up
the
fire
of
the
soul
consumes
them
alone
he
might
weep
and
then
under
the
kiosk
he
saw
a
white
figure
which
reminded
him
of
francesca
and
for
three
months
i
have
had
no
letter
from
her
what
has
become
of
her
i
have
not
written
for
two
months
but
i
warned
her
is
she
ill
oh
my
love
my
life
will
you
ever
know
what
i
have
gone
through
what
a
wretched
constitution
is
mine
have
i
an
aneurism
he
asked
himself
feeling
his
heart
beat
so
violently
that
its
pulses
seemed
audible
in
the
silence
like
little
grains
of
sand
dropping
on
a
big
drum
at
this
moment
three
distinct
taps
sounded
on
his
door
albert
hastened
to
open
it
and
almost
fainted
with
joy
at
seeing
the
s
cheerful
and
triumphant
mien
without
a
word
he
threw
his
arms
round
the
abbe
de
grancey
held
him
fast
and
clasped
him
closely
letting
his
head
fall
on
the
old
man
s
shoulder
he
was
a
child
again
he
cried
as
he
had
cried
on
hearing
that
francesca
soderini
was
a
married
woman
he
betrayed
his
weakness
to
no
one
but
to
this
priest
on
whose
face
shone
the
light
of
hope
the
priest
had
been
sublime
and
as
shrewd
as
he
was
sublime
forgive
me
dear
abbe
but
you
come
at
one
of
those
moments
when
the
man
vanishes
for
you
are
not
to
think
me
vulgarly
oh
i
know
replied
the
abbe
you
wrote
for
love
s
ah
my
son
it
was
love
in
despair
that
made
me
a
priest
in
at
the
age
of
in
i
was
in
charge
of
a
parish
i
know
i
have
refused
three
bishoprics
already
i
mean
to
die
at
come
and
see
her
cried
savarus
seizing
a
candle
and
leading
the
abbe
into
the
handsome
room
where
hung
the
portrait
of
the
duchesse
d
argaiolo
which
he
lighted
up
she
is
one
of
those
women
who
are
born
to
reign
said
the
understanding
how
great
an
affection
albert
showed
him
by
this
mark
of
confidence
but
there
is
pride
on
that
brow
it
is
implacable
she
would
never
forgive
an
insult
it
is
the
archangel
michael
the
angel
of
execution
the
inexorable
angel
all
or
nothing
is
the
motto
of
this
type
of
angel
there
is
something
divinely
pitiless
in
that
you
have
guessed
well
cried
savarus
but
my
dear
abbe
for
more
than
twelve
years
now
she
had
reigned
over
my
life
and
i
have
not
a
thought
for
which
to
blame
myself
ah
if
you
could
only
say
the
same
of
god
said
the
priest
with
simplicity
now
to
talk
of
your
affairs
for
ten
days
i
have
been
at
work
for
you
if
you
are
a
real
politician
this
time
you
will
follow
my
advice
you
would
not
be
where
you
are
now
if
you
would
have
gone
to
the
wattevilles
when
i
first
told
you
but
you
must
go
there
i
will
take
you
in
the
evening
the
rouxey
estates
are
in
danger
the
case
must
be
defended
within
three
days
the
election
will
not
be
over
in
three
days
they
will
take
good
care
not
to
appoint
examiners
the
first
day
there
will
be
several
voting
days
and
you
will
be
elected
by
ballot
how
can
that
be
asked
savarus
by
winning
the
rouxey
lawsuit
you
will
gain
eighty
legitimist
votes
add
them
to
the
thirty
i
can
command
and
you
have
a
hundred
and
ten
then
as
twenty
remain
to
you
of
the
boucher
committee
you
will
have
a
hundred
and
thirty
in
well
said
albert
we
must
get
yes
said
the
priest
since
all
the
rest
are
ministerial
but
my
son
you
have
two
hundred
votes
and
the
prefecture
no
more
than
a
hundred
and
i
have
two
hundred
votes
said
albert
standing
stupid
with
amazement
after
starting
to
his
feet
as
if
shot
up
by
a
spring
you
have
those
of
monsieur
de
chavoncourt
said
the
abbe
how
said
albert
you
will
marry
mademoiselle
sidonie
de
never
you
will
marry
mademoiselle
sidonie
de
chavoncourt
the
priest
repeated
coldly
but
you
see
she
is
inexorable
said
albert
pointing
to
francesca
you
will
marry
mademoiselle
sidonie
de
chavoncourt
said
the
abbe
calmly
for
the
third
time
this
time
albert
understood
the
would
not
be
implicated
in
a
scheme
which
at
last
smiled
on
the
despairing
politician
a
word
more
would
have
compromised
the
priest
s
dignity
and
honor
evening
at
the
hotel
de
rupt
you
will
meet
madame
de
chavoncourt
and
her
second
daughter
you
can
thank
her
beforehand
for
what
she
is
going
to
do
for
you
and
tell
her
that
your
gratitude
is
unbounded
that
you
are
hers
body
and
soul
that
henceforth
your
future
is
that
of
her
family
you
are
quite
disinterested
for
you
have
so
much
confidence
in
yourself
that
you
regard
the
nomination
as
deputy
as
a
sufficient
fortune
you
will
have
a
struggle
with
madame
de
chavoncourt
she
will
want
you
to
pledge
your
word
all
your
future
life
my
son
lies
in
that
evening
but
understand
clearly
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
i
am
answerable
only
for
legitimist
voters
i
have
secured
madame
de
watteville
and
that
means
all
the
aristocracy
of
besancon
amedee
de
soulas
and
vauchelles
who
will
both
vote
for
you
have
won
over
the
young
men
madame
de
watteville
will
get
the
old
ones
as
to
my
electors
they
are
and
who
on
earth
has
gained
over
madame
de
chavoncourt
asked
savarus
ask
me
no
questions
replied
the
abbe
monsieur
de
chavoncourt
who
has
three
daughters
to
marry
is
not
capable
of
increasing
his
wealth
though
vauchelles
marries
the
eldest
without
anything
from
her
father
because
her
old
aunt
is
to
settle
something
on
her
what
is
to
become
of
the
two
others
sidonie
is
sixteen
and
your
ambition
is
as
good
as
a
gold
mine
some
one
has
told
madame
de
chavoncourt
that
she
will
do
better
by
getting
her
daughter
married
than
by
sending
her
husband
to
waste
his
money
in
paris
that
some
one
manages
madame
de
chavoncourt
and
madame
de
chavoncourt
manages
her
that
is
enough
my
dear
abbe
i
understand
when
once
i
am
returned
as
deputy
i
have
somebody
s
fortune
to
make
and
by
making
it
large
enough
i
shall
be
released
from
my
promise
in
me
you
have
a
son
a
man
who
will
owe
his
happiness
to
you
great
heavens
what
have
i
done
to
deserve
so
true
a
friend
you
won
a
triumph
for
the
chapter
said
the
smiling
now
as
to
all
this
be
as
secret
as
the
tomb
we
are
nothing
we
have
done
nothing
if
we
were
known
to
have
meddled
in
election
matters
we
should
be
eaten
up
alive
by
the
puritans
of
the
left
who
do
worse
and
blamed
by
some
of
our
own
party
who
want
everything
madame
de
chavoncourt
has
no
suspicion
of
my
share
in
all
this
i
have
confided
in
no
one
but
madame
de
watteville
whom
we
may
trust
as
we
trust
i
will
bring
the
duchess
to
you
to
be
blessed
cried
savarus
after
seeing
out
the
old
priest
albert
went
to
bed
in
the
swaddling
clothes
of
power
next
evening
as
may
well
be
supposed
by
nine
o
clock
madame
la
baronne
de
watteville
s
rooms
were
crowded
by
the
aristocracy
of
besancon
in
convocation
extraordinary
they
were
discussing
the
exceptional
step
of
going
to
the
poll
to
oblige
the
daughter
of
the
rupts
it
was
known
that
the
former
master
of
appeals
the
secretary
of
one
of
the
most
faithful
ministers
under
the
elder
branch
was
to
be
presented
that
evening
madame
de
chavoncourt
was
there
with
her
second
daughter
sidonie
exquisitely
dressed
while
her
elder
sister
secure
of
her
lover
had
not
indulged
in
any
of
the
arts
of
the
toilet
in
country
towns
these
little
things
are
remarked
the
abbe
de
grancey
s
fine
and
clever
head
was
to
be
seen
moving
from
group
to
group
listening
to
everything
seeming
to
be
apart
from
it
all
but
uttering
those
incisive
phrases
which
sum
up
a
question
and
direct
the
issue
if
the
elder
branch
were
to
return
said
he
to
an
old
statesman
of
seventy
what
politicians
would
they
find
berryer
alone
on
his
bench
does
not
know
which
way
to
turn
if
he
had
sixty
votes
he
would
often
scotch
the
wheels
of
the
government
and
upset
ministries
the
duc
de
is
to
be
nominated
at
you
will
enable
monsieur
de
watteville
to
win
his
if
you
vote
for
monsieur
savarus
the
republicans
will
vote
with
you
rather
than
with
the
moderates
etc
at
nine
o
clock
albert
had
not
arrived
madame
de
watteville
was
disposed
to
regard
such
delay
as
an
impertinence
my
dear
baroness
said
madame
de
chavoncourt
do
not
let
such
serious
issues
turn
on
such
a
trifle
the
varnish
on
his
boots
is
not
dry
or
a
consultation
perhaps
detains
monsieur
de
rosalie
shot
a
side
glance
at
madame
de
chavoncourt
she
is
very
lenient
to
monsieur
de
savarus
she
whispered
to
her
mother
you
see
said
the
baroness
with
a
smile
there
is
a
question
of
a
marriage
between
sidonie
and
monsieur
de
mademoiselle
de
watteville
hastily
went
to
a
window
looking
out
over
the
garden
at
ten
o
clock
albert
de
savarus
had
not
yet
appeared
the
storm
that
threatened
now
burst
some
of
the
gentlemen
sat
down
to
cards
finding
the
thing
intolerable
the
abbe
de
grancey
who
did
not
know
what
to
think
went
to
the
window
where
rosalie
was
hidden
and
exclaimed
aloud
in
his
amazement
he
must
be
dead
the
stepped
out
into
the
garden
followed
by
monsieur
de
watteville
and
his
daughter
and
they
all
three
went
up
to
the
kiosk
in
albert
s
rooms
all
was
dark
not
a
light
was
to
be
seen
jerome
cried
rosalie
seeing
the
servant
in
the
yard
below
the
abbe
looked
at
her
with
astonishment
where
in
the
world
is
your
master
she
asked
the
man
who
came
to
the
foot
of
the
wall
gone
in
a
he
is
ruined
exclaimed
the
abbe
de
grancey
or
he
is
happy
the
joy
of
triumph
was
not
so
effectually
concealed
on
rosalie
s
face
that
the
could
not
detect
it
he
affected
to
see
nothing
what
can
this
girl
have
had
to
do
with
this
business
he
asked
himself
they
all
three
returned
to
the
where
monsieur
de
watteville
announced
the
strange
the
extraordinary
the
prodigious
news
of
the
lawyer
s
departure
without
any
reason
assigned
for
his
evasion
by
eleven
only
fifteen
persons
remained
among
them
madame
de
chavoncourt
and
the
abbe
de
godenars
another
a
man
of
about
forty
who
hoped
for
a
bishopric
the
two
chavoncourt
girls
and
monsieur
de
vauchelles
the
abbe
de
grancey
rosalie
amedee
de
soulas
and
a
retired
magistrate
one
of
the
most
influential
members
of
the
upper
circle
of
besancon
who
had
been
very
eager
for
albert
s
election
the
abbe
de
grancey
sat
down
by
the
baroness
in
such
a
position
as
to
watch
rosalie
whose
face
usually
pale
wore
a
feverish
flush
what
can
have
happened
to
monsieur
de
savarus
said
madame
de
chavoncourt
at
this
moment
a
servant
in
livery
brought
in
a
letter
for
the
abbe
de
grancey
on
a
silver
tray
pray
read
it
said
the
baroness
the
read
the
letter
he
saw
rosalie
suddenly
turn
as
white
as
her
kerchief
she
recognizes
the
writing
said
he
to
himself
after
glancing
at
the
girl
over
his
spectacles
he
folded
up
the
letter
and
calmly
put
it
in
his
pocket
without
a
word
in
three
minutes
he
had
met
three
looks
from
rosalie
which
were
enough
to
make
him
guess
everything
she
is
in
love
with
albert
savarus
thought
the
he
rose
and
took
leave
he
was
going
towards
the
door
when
in
the
next
room
he
was
overtaken
by
rosalie
who
said
monsieur
de
grancey
it
was
from
albert
how
do
you
know
that
it
was
his
writing
to
recognize
it
from
so
far
the
girl
s
reply
caught
as
she
was
in
the
toils
of
her
impatience
and
rage
seemed
to
the
abbe
sublime
i
love
him
what
is
the
matter
she
said
after
a
pause
he
gives
up
the
rosalie
put
her
finger
to
her
lip
i
ask
you
to
be
as
secret
as
if
it
were
a
confession
said
she
before
returning
to
the
if
there
is
an
end
of
the
election
there
is
an
end
of
the
marriage
with
in
the
morning
on
her
way
to
mass
mademoiselle
de
watteville
heard
from
mariette
some
of
the
circumstances
which
had
prompted
albert
s
disappearance
at
the
most
critical
moment
of
his
life
mademoiselle
an
old
gentleman
from
paris
arrived
yesterday
morning
at
the
hotel
national
he
came
in
his
own
carriage
with
four
horses
and
a
courier
in
front
and
a
servant
indeed
jerome
who
saw
the
carriage
returning
declares
he
could
only
be
a
prince
or
a
was
there
a
coronet
on
the
carriage
asked
rosalie
i
do
not
know
said
mariette
just
as
two
was
striking
he
came
to
call
on
monsieur
savarus
and
sent
in
his
card
and
when
he
saw
it
jerome
says
monsieur
turned
as
pale
as
a
sheet
and
said
he
was
to
be
shown
in
as
he
himself
locked
the
door
it
is
impossible
to
tell
what
the
old
gentleman
and
the
lawyer
said
to
each
other
but
they
were
together
above
an
hour
and
then
the
old
gentleman
with
the
lawyer
called
up
his
servant
jerome
saw
the
servant
go
out
again
with
an
immense
package
four
feet
long
which
looked
like
a
great
painting
on
canvas
the
old
gentleman
had
in
his
hand
a
large
parcel
of
papers
monsieur
savaron
was
paler
than
death
and
he
so
proud
so
dignified
was
in
a
state
to
be
pitied
but
he
treated
the
old
gentleman
so
respectfully
that
he
could
not
have
been
politer
to
the
king
himself
jerome
and
monsieur
albert
savaron
escorted
the
gentleman
to
his
carriage
which
was
standing
with
the
horses
in
the
courier
started
on
the
stroke
of
three
monsieur
savaron
went
straight
to
the
prefecture
and
from
that
to
monsieur
gentillet
who
sold
him
the
old
traveling
carriage
that
used
to
belong
to
madame
de
before
she
died
then
he
ordered
post
horses
for
six
o
clock
he
went
home
to
pack
no
doubt
he
wrote
a
lot
of
letters
finally
he
settled
everything
with
monsieur
girardet
who
went
to
him
and
stayed
till
seven
jerome
carried
a
note
to
monsieur
boucher
with
whom
his
master
was
to
have
dined
and
then
at
seven
the
lawyer
set
out
leaving
jerome
with
three
months
wages
and
telling
him
to
find
another
place
he
left
his
keys
with
monsieur
girardet
whom
he
took
home
and
at
his
house
jerome
says
he
took
a
plate
of
soup
for
at
seven
monsieur
girardet
had
not
yet
dined
when
monsieur
savaron
got
into
the
carriage
he
looked
like
death
jerome
who
of
course
saw
his
master
off
heard
him
tell
the
postilion
the
geneva
road
did
jerome
ask
the
name
of
the
stranger
at
the
hotel
national
as
the
old
gentleman
did
not
mean
to
stay
he
was
not
asked
for
it
the
servant
by
his
orders
no
doubt
pretended
not
to
speak
and
the
letter
which
came
so
late
to
abbe
de
grancey
said
rosalie
it
was
monsieur
girardet
no
doubt
who
ought
to
have
delivered
it
but
jerome
says
that
poor
monsieur
girardet
who
was
much
attached
to
lawyer
savaron
was
as
much
upset
as
he
was
so
he
who
came
so
mysteriously
as
mademoiselle
galard
says
is
gone
away
just
as
after
hearing
this
narrative
mademoiselle
de
watteville
fell
into
a
brooding
and
absent
mood
which
everybody
could
see
it
is
useless
to
say
anything
of
the
commotion
that
arose
in
besancon
on
the
disappearance
of
monsieur
savaron
it
was
understood
that
the
prefect
had
obliged
him
with
the
greatest
readiness
by
giving
him
at
once
a
passport
across
the
frontier
for
he
was
thus
quit
of
his
only
opponent
next
day
monsieur
de
chavoncourt
was
carried
to
the
top
by
a
majority
of
a
hundred
and
forty
votes
jack
is
gone
by
the
way
he
came
said
an
elector
on
hearing
of
albert
savaron
s
flight
this
event
lent
weight
to
the
prevailing
prejudice
at
besancon
against
strangers
indeed
two
years
previously
they
had
received
confirmation
from
the
affair
of
the
republican
newspaper
ten
days
later
albert
de
savarus
was
never
spoken
of
again
only
three
persons
girardet
the
attorney
the
and
rosalie
were
seriously
affected
by
his
disappearance
girardet
knew
that
the
stranger
was
prince
soderini
for
he
had
seen
his
card
and
he
told
the
but
rosalie
better
informed
than
either
of
them
had
known
for
three
months
past
that
the
duc
d
argaiolo
was
dead
in
the
month
of
april
no
one
had
had
any
news
from
or
of
albert
de
savarus
jerome
and
mariette
were
to
be
married
but
the
baroness
confidentially
desired
her
maid
to
wait
till
her
daughter
was
married
saying
that
the
two
weddings
might
take
place
at
the
same
time
it
is
time
that
rosalie
should
be
married
said
the
baroness
one
day
to
monsieur
de
watteville
she
is
nineteen
and
she
is
fearfully
altered
in
these
last
i
do
not
know
what
ails
her
said
the
baron
when
fathers
do
not
know
what
ails
their
daughters
mothers
can
guess
said
the
baroness
we
must
get
her
i
am
quite
willing
said
the
baron
i
shall
give
her
les
rouxey
now
that
the
court
has
settled
our
quarrel
with
the
authorities
of
riceys
by
fixing
the
boundary
line
at
three
hundred
feet
up
the
side
of
the
dent
de
vilard
i
am
having
a
trench
made
to
collect
all
the
water
and
carry
it
into
the
lake
the
village
did
not
appeal
so
the
decision
is
it
has
never
occurred
to
you
said
madame
de
watteville
that
this
decision
cost
me
thirty
thousand
francs
handed
over
to
chantonnit
that
peasant
would
take
nothing
else
he
sold
us
if
you
give
away
les
rouxey
you
will
have
nothing
left
said
the
baroness
i
do
not
need
much
said
the
baron
i
am
breaking
you
eat
like
an
ogre
just
so
but
however
much
i
may
eat
i
feel
my
legs
get
weaker
and
weaker
it
is
from
working
the
lathe
said
his
wife
i
do
not
know
said
he
we
will
marry
rosalie
to
monsieur
de
soulas
if
you
give
her
les
rouxey
keep
the
life
interest
i
will
give
them
fifteen
thousand
francs
a
year
in
the
funds
our
children
can
live
here
i
do
not
see
that
they
are
much
to
be
no
i
shall
give
them
les
rouxey
out
and
out
rosalie
is
fond
of
les
you
are
a
queer
man
with
your
daughter
it
does
not
occur
to
you
to
ask
me
if
i
am
fond
of
les
rosalie
at
once
sent
for
was
informed
that
she
was
to
marry
monsieur
de
soulas
one
day
early
in
the
month
of
may
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
mother
and
to
you
too
father
for
having
thought
of
settling
me
but
i
do
not
mean
to
marry
i
am
very
happy
with
mere
speeches
said
the
baroness
you
are
not
in
love
with
monsieur
de
soulas
that
is
if
you
insist
on
the
plain
truth
i
will
never
marry
monsieur
de
soulas
oh
the
of
a
girl
of
nineteen
retorted
her
mother
with
a
bitter
smile
the
of
mademoiselle
de
watteville
said
rosalie
with
firm
decision
my
father
i
imagine
has
no
intention
of
making
me
marry
against
my
wishes
no
indeed
no
said
the
poor
baron
looking
affectionately
at
his
daughter
very
well
said
the
baroness
sternly
controlling
the
rage
of
a
bigot
startled
at
finding
herself
unexpectedly
defied
you
yourself
monsieur
de
watteville
may
take
the
responsibility
of
settling
your
daughter
consider
well
mademoiselle
for
if
you
do
not
marry
to
my
mind
you
will
get
nothing
out
of
me
the
quarrel
thus
begun
between
madame
de
watteville
and
her
husband
who
took
his
daughter
s
part
went
so
far
that
rosalie
and
her
father
were
obliged
to
spend
the
summer
at
les
rouxey
life
at
the
hotel
de
rupt
was
unendurable
it
thus
became
known
in
besancon
that
mademoiselle
de
watteville
had
positively
refused
the
comte
de
soulas
after
their
marriage
mariette
and
jerome
came
to
les
rouxey
to
succeed
to
modinier
in
due
time
the
baron
restored
and
repaired
the
house
to
suit
his
daughter
s
taste
when
she
heard
that
these
improvements
had
cost
about
sixty
thousand
francs
and
that
rosalie
and
her
father
were
building
a
conservatory
the
baroness
understood
that
there
was
a
leaven
of
spite
in
her
daughter
the
baron
purchased
various
outlying
plots
and
a
little
estate
worth
thirty
thousand
francs
madame
de
watteville
was
told
that
away
from
her
rosalie
showed
masterly
qualities
that
she
was
taking
steps
to
improve
the
value
of
les
rouxey
that
she
had
treated
herself
to
a
riding
habit
and
rode
about
her
father
whom
she
made
very
happy
who
no
longer
complained
of
his
health
and
who
was
growing
fat
accompanied
her
in
her
expeditions
as
the
baroness
grew
near

name

louise
the
came
one
day
to
les
rouxey
deputed
no
doubt
by
madame
de
watteville
and
monsieur
de
soulas
to
negotiate
a
peace
between
mother
and
daughter
that
little
rosalie
has
a
head
on
her
shoulders
said
the
folk
of
besancon
after
handsomely
paying
up
the
ninety
thousand
francs
spent
on
les
rouxey
the
baroness
allowed
her
husband
a
thousand
francs
a
month
to
live
on
she
would
not
put
herself
in
the
wrong
the
father
and
daughter
were
perfectly
willing
to
return
to
besancon
for
the
of
august
and
to
remain
there
till
the
end
of
the
month
when
after
dinner
the
took
mademoiselle
de
watteville
apart
to
open
the
question
of
the
marriage
by
explaining
to
her
that
it
was
vain
to
think
any
more
of
albert
of
whom
they
had
had
no
news
for
a
year
past
he
was
stopped
at
once
by
a
sign
from
rosalie
the
strange
girl
took
monsieur
de
grancey
by
the
arm
and
led
him
to
a
seat
under
a
clump
of
rhododendrons
whence
there
was
a
view
of
the
lake
listen
dear
abbe
said
she
you
whom
i
love
as
much
as
my
father
for
you
had
an
affection
for
my
albert
i
must
at
last
confess
that
i
committed
crimes
to
become
his
wife
and
he
must
be
my
here
read
she
held
out
to
him
a
number
of
the
which
she
had
in
her
apron
pocket
pointing
out
the
following
paragraph
under
the
date
of
florence
may
the
wedding
of
monsieur
le
duc
de
rhetore
eldest
son
of
the
duc
de
chaulieu
the
former
ambassador
to
madame
la
duchesse
d
argaiolo
princess
soderini
was
solemnized
with
great
splendor
numerous
entertainments
given
in
honor
of
the
marriage
are
making
florence
gay
the
duchess
fortune
is
one
of
the
finest
in
italy
for
the
late
duke
left
her
the
woman
he
loved
is
married
said
she
i
divided
you
how
asked
the
abbe
rosalie
was
about
to
reply
when
she
was
interrupted
by
a
loud
cry
from
two
of
the
gardeners
following
on
the
sound
of
a
body
falling
into
the
water
she
started
and
ran
off
screaming
oh
father
the
baron
had
disappeared
in
trying
to
reach
a
piece
of
granite
on
which
he
fancied
he
saw
the
impression
of
a
shell
a
circumstance
which
would
have
contradicted
some
system
of
geology
monsieur
de
watteville
had
gone
down
the
slope
lost
his
balance
and
slipped
into
the
lake
which
of
course
was
deepest
close
under
the
roadway
the
men
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
enabling
the
baron
to
catch
hold
of
a
pole
pushed
down
at
the
place
where
the
water
was
bubbling
but
at
last
they
pulled
him
out
covered
with
mud
in
which
he
had
sunk
he
was
getting
deeper
and
deeper
in
by
dint
of
struggling
monsieur
de
watteville
had
dined
heavily
digestion
was
in
progress
and
was
thus
checked
when
he
had
been
undressed
washed
and
put
to
bed
he
was
in
such
evident
danger
that
two
servants
at
once
set
out
on
horseback
one
to
ride
to
besancon
and
the
other
to
fetch
the
nearest
doctor
and
surgeon
when
madame
de
watteville
arrived
eight
hours
later
with
the
first
medical
aid
from
besancon
they
found
monsieur
de
watteville
past
all
hope
in
spite
of
the
intelligent
treatment
of
the
rouxey
doctor
the
fright
had
produced
serious
effusion
on
the
brain
and
the
shock
to
the
digestion
was
helping
to
kill
the
poor
man
this
death
which
would
never
have
happened
said
madame
de
watteville
if
her
husband
had
stayed
at
besancon
was
ascribed
by
her
to
her
daughter
s
obstinacy
she
took
an
aversion
for
rosalie
abandoning
herself
to
grief
and
regrets
that
were
evidently
exaggerated
she
spoke
of
the
baron
as
her
dear
lamb
the
last
of
the
wattevilles
was
buried
on
an
island
in
the
lake
at
les
rouxey
where
the
baroness
had
a
little
gothic
monument
erected
of
white
marble
like
that
called
the
tomb
of
heloise
at
a
month
after
this
catastrophe
the
mother
and
daughter
had
settled
in
the
hotel
de
rupt
where
they
lived
in
savage
silence
rosalie
was
suffering
from
real
sorrow
which
had
no
visible
outlet
she
accused
herself
of
her
father
s
death
and
she
feared
another
disaster
much
greater
in
her
eyes
and
very
certainly
her
own
work
neither
girardet
the
attorney
nor
the
abbe
de
grancey
could
obtain
any
information
concerning
albert
this
silence
was
appalling
in
a
paroxysm
of
repentance
she
felt
that
she
must
confess
to
the
the
horrible
machinations
by
which
she
had
separated
francesca
and
albert
they
had
been
simple
but
formidable
mademoiselle
de
watteville
had
intercepted
albert
s
letters
to
the
duchess
as
well
as
that
in
which
francesca
announced
her
husband
s
illness
warning
her
lover
that
she
could
write
to
him
no
more
during
the
time
while
she
was
devoted
as
was
her
duty
to
the
care
of
the
dying
man
thus
while
albert
was
wholly
occupied
with
election
matters
the
duchess
had
written
him
only
two
letters
one
in
which
she
told
him
that
the
duc
d
argaiolo
was
in
danger
and
one
announcing
her
widowhood
two
noble
and
beautiful
letters
which
rosalie
kept
back
after
several
nights
labor
she
succeeded
in
imitating
albert
s
writing
very
perfectly
she
had
substituted
three
letters
of
her
own
writing
for
three
of
albert
s
and
the
rough
copies
which
she
showed
to
the
old
priest
made
him
shudder
the
genius
of
evil
was
revealed
in
them
to
such
perfection
rosalie
writing
in
albert
s
name
had
prepared
the
duchess
for
a
change
in
the
frenchman
s
feelings
falsely
representing
him
as
faithless
and
she
had
answered
the
news
of
the
duc
d
argaiolo
s
death
by
announcing
the
marriage
ere
long
of
albert
and
mademoiselle
de
watteville
the
two
letters
intended
to
cross
on
the
road
had
in
fact
done
so
the
infernal
cleverness
with
which
the
letters
were
written
so
much
astonished
the
that
he
read
them
a
second
time
francesca
stabbed
to
the
heart
by
a
girl
who
wanted
to
kill
love
in
her
rival
had
answered
the
last
in
these
four
words
you
are
free
purely
moral
crimes
which
give
no
hold
to
human
justice
are
the
most
atrocious
and
detestable
said
the
abbe
severely
god
often
punishes
them
on
earth
herein
lies
the
reason
of
the
terrible
catastrophes
which
to
us
seem
inexplicable
of
all
secret
crimes
buried
in
the
mystery
of
private
life
the
most
disgraceful
is
that
of
breaking
the
seal
of
a
letter
or
of
reading
it
surreptitiously
every
one
whoever
it
may
be
and
urged
by
whatever
reason
who
is
guilty
of
such
an
act
has
stained
his
honor
beyond
retrieving
do
you
not
feel
all
that
is
touching
that
is
heavenly
in
the
story
of
the
youthful
page
falsely
accused
and
carrying
the
letter
containing
the
order
for
his
execution
who
sets
out
without
a
thought
of
ill
and
whom
providence
protects
and
saves
miraculously
we
say
but
do
you
know
wherein
the
miracle
lies
virtue
has
a
glory
as
potent
as
that
of
innocent
childhood
i
say
these
things
not
meaning
to
admonish
you
said
the
old
priest
with
deep
grief
i
alas
am
not
your
spiritual
director
you
are
not
kneeling
at
the
feet
of
god
i
am
your
friend
appalled
by
dread
of
what
your
punishment
may
be
what
has
become
of
that
unhappy
albert
has
he
perhaps
killed
himself
there
was
tremendous
passion
under
his
assumption
of
calm
i
understand
now
that
old
prince
soderini
the
father
of
the
duchess
d
argaiolo
came
here
to
take
back
his
daughter
s
letters
and
portraits
this
was
the
thunderbolt
that
fell
on
albert
s
head
and
he
went
off
no
doubt
to
try
to
justify
himself
but
how
is
it
that
in
fourteen
months
he
has
given
us
no
news
of
himself
oh
if
i
marry
him
he
will
be
so
happy
happy
he
does
not
love
you
besides
you
have
no
great
fortune
to
give
him
your
mother
detests
you
you
made
her
a
fierce
reply
which
rankles
and
which
will
be
your
ruin
when
she
told
you
yesterday
that
obedience
was
the
only
way
to
repair
your
errors
and
reminded
you
of
the
need
for
marrying
mentioning
amedee
if
you
are
so
fond
of
him
marry
him
yourself
mother
did
you
or
did
you
not
fling
these
words
in
her
teeth
yes
said
rosalie
well
i
know
her
monsieur
de
grancey
went
on
in
a
few
months
she
will
be
comtesse
de
soulas
she
will
be
sure
to
have
children
she
will
give
monsieur
de
soulas
forty
thousand
francs
a
year
she
will
benefit
him
in
other
ways
and
reduce
your
share
of
her
fortune
as
much
as
possible
you
will
be
poor
as
long
as
she
lives
and
she
is
but
your
whole
estate
will
be
the
land
of
les
rouxey
and
the
small
share
left
to
you
after
your
father
s
legal
debts
are
settled
if
indeed
your
mother
should
consent
to
forego
her
claims
on
les
rouxey
from
the
point
of
view
of
material
advantages
you
have
done
badly
for
yourself
from
the
point
of
view
of
feeling
i
imagine
you
have
wrecked
your
life
instead
of
going
to
your
mother
rosalie
shook
her
head
fiercely
to
your
mother
the
priest
went
on
and
to
religion
where
you
would
at
the
first
impulse
of
your
heart
have
found
enlightenment
counsel
and
guidance
you
chose
to
act
in
your
own
way
knowing
nothing
of
life
and
listening
only
to
passion
these
words
of
wisdom
terrified
mademoiselle
de
watteville
and
what
ought
i
to
do
now
she
asked
after
a
pause
to
repair
your
you
must
ascertain
its
extent
said
the
abbe
well
i
will
write
to
the
only
man
who
can
know
anything
of
albert
s
fate
monsieur
leopold
hannequin
a
notary
in
paris
his
friend
since
write
no
more
unless
to
do
honor
to
truth
said
the
place
the
real
and
the
false
letters
in
my
hands
confess
everything
in
detail
as
though
i
were
the
keeper
of
your
conscience
asking
me
how
you
may
expiate
your
sins
and
doing
as
i
bid
you
i
shall
see
for
above
all
things
restore
this
unfortunate
man
to
his
innocence
in
the
eyes
of
the
woman
he
had
made
his
divinity
on
earth
though
he
has
lost
his
happiness
albert
must
still
hope
for
rosalie
promised
to
obey
the
abbe
hoping
that
the
steps
he
might
take
would
perhaps
end
in
bringing
albert
back
to
her
not
long
after
mademoiselle
de
watteville
s
confession
a
clerk
came
to
besancon
from
monsieur
leopold
hannequin
armed
with
a
power
of
attorney
from
albert
he
called
first
on
monsieur
girardet
begging
his
assistance
in
selling
the
house
belonging
to
monsieur
savaron
the
attorney
undertook
to
do
this
out
of
friendship
for
albert
the
clerk
from
paris
sold
the
furniture
and
with
the
proceeds
could
repay
some
money
owed
by
savaron
to
girardet
who
on
the
occasion
of
his
inexplicable
departure
had
lent
him
five
thousand
francs
while
undertaking
to
collect
his
assets
when
girardet
asked
what
had
become
of
the
handsome
and
noble
pleader
to
whom
he
had
been
so
much
attached
the
clerk
replied
that
no
one
knew
but
his
master
and
that
the
notary
had
seemed
greatly
distressed
by
the
contents
of
the
last
letter
he
had
received
from
monsieur
albert
de
savarus
on
hearing
this
the
wrote
to
leopold
this
was
the
worthy
notary
s
reply
to
monsieur
l
abbe
de
grancey
of
the
diocese
of
besancon
paris
alas
monsieur
it
is
in
nobody
s
power
to
restore
albert
to
the
life
of
the
world
he
has
renounced
it
he
is
a
novice
in
the
monastery
of
the
grand
chartreuse
near
grenoble
you
know
better
than
i
who
have
but
just
learned
it
that
on
the
threshold
of
that
cloister
everything
dies
albert
foreseeing
that
i
should
go
to
him
placed
the
general
of
the
order
between
my
utmost
efforts
and
himself
i
know
his
noble
soul
well
enough
to
be
sure
that
he
is
the
victim
of
some
odious
plot
unknown
to
us
but
everything
is
at
an
end
the
duchesse
d
argaiolo
now
duchesse
de
rhetore
seems
to
me
to
have
carried
severity
to
an
extreme
at
belgirate
which
she
had
left
when
albert
flew
thither
she
had
left
instructions
leading
him
to
believe
that
she
was
living
in
london
from
london
albert
went
in
search
of
her
to
naples
and
from
naples
to
rome
where
she
was
now
engaged
to
the
duc
de
rhetore
when
albert
succeeded
in
seeing
madame
d
argaiolo
at
florence
it
was
at
the
ceremony
of
her
marriage
our
poor
friend
swooned
in
the
church
and
even
when
he
was
in
danger
of
death
he
could
never
obtain
any
explanation
from
this
woman
who
must
have
had
i
know
not
what
in
her
heart
for
seven
months
albert
had
traveled
in
pursuit
of
a
cruel
creature
who
thought
it
sport
to
escape
him
he
knew
not
where
or
how
to
catch
her
i
saw
him
on
his
way
through
paris
and
if
you
had
seen
him
as
i
did
you
would
have
felt
that
not
a
word
might
be
spoken
about
the
duchess
at
the
risk
of
bringing
on
an
attack
which
might
have
wrecked
his
reason
if
he
had
known
what
his
crime
was
he
might
have
found
means
to
justify
himself
but
being
falsely
accused
of
being
married
what
could
he
do
albert
is
dead
quite
dead
to
the
world
he
longed
for
rest
let
us
hope
that
the
deep
silence
and
prayer
into
which
he
has
thrown
himself
may
give
him
happiness
in
another
guise
you
monsieur
who
have
known
him
must
greatly
pity
him
and
pity
his
friends
also
yours
as
soon
as
he
received
this
letter
the
good
wrote
to
the
general
of
the
carthusian
order
and
this
was
the
letter
he
received
from
albert
savarus
brother
albert
to
monsieur
l
abbe
de
grancey
of
the
diocese
of
besancon
la
grande
chartreuse
i
recognized
your
tender
soul
dear
and
and
your
still
youthful
heart
in
all
that
the
reverend
father
general
of
our
order
has
just
told
me
you
have
understood
the
only
wish
that
lurks
in
the
depths
of
my
heart
so
far
as
the
things
of
the
world
are
concerned
to
get
justice
done
to
my
feelings
by
her
who
has
treated
me
so
badly
but
before
leaving
me
at
liberty
to
avail
myself
of
your
offer
the
general
wanted
to
know
that
my
vocation
was
sincere
he
was
so
kind
as
to
tell
me
his
idea
on
finding
that
i
was
determined
to
preserve
absolute
silence
on
this
point
if
i
had
yielded
to
the
temptation
to
rehabilitate
the
man
of
the
world
the
friar
would
have
been
rejected
by
this
monastery
grace
has
certainly
done
her
work
but
though
short
the
struggle
was
not
the
less
keen
or
the
less
painful
is
not
this
enough
to
show
you
that
i
could
never
return
to
the
world
hence
my
forgiveness
which
you
ask
for
the
author
of
so
much
woe
is
entire
and
without
a
thought
of
vindictiveness
i
will
pray
to
god
to
forgive
that
young
lady
as
i
forgive
her
and
as
i
shall
beseech
him
to
give
madame
de
rhetore
a
life
of
happiness
ah
whether
it
be
death
or
the
obstinate
hand
of
a
young
girl
madly
bent
on
being
loved
or
one
of
the
blows
ascribed
to
chance
must
we
not
all
obey
god
sorrow
in
some
souls
makes
a
vast
void
through
which
the
divine
voice
rings
i
learned
too
late
the
bearings
of
this
life
on
that
which
awaits
us
all
in
me
is
worn
out
i
could
not
serve
in
the
ranks
of
the
church
militant
and
i
lay
the
remains
of
an
almost
extinct
life
at
the
foot
of
the
altar
this
is
the
last
time
i
shall
ever
write
you
alone
who
loved
me
and
whom
i
loved
so
well
could
make
me
break
the
law
of
oblivion
i
imposed
on
myself
when
i
entered
these
headquarters
of
saint
bruno
but
you
are
always
especially
named
in
the
prayers
of
brother
albert
november
everything
is
for
the
best
perhaps
thought
the
abbe
de
grancey
when
he
showed
this
letter
to
rosalie
who
with
a
pious
impulse
kissed
the
lines
which
contained
her
forgiveness
he
said
to
her
well
now
that
he
is
lost
to
you
will
you
not
be
reconciled
to
your
mother
and
marry
the
comte
de
soulas
only
if
albert
should
order
it
said
she
but
you
see
it
is
impossible
to
consult
him
the
general
of
the
order
would
not
allow
if
i
were
to
go
to
see
him
no
carthusian
sees
any
visitor
besides
no
woman
but
the
queen
of
france
may
enter
a
carthusian
monastery
said
the
abbe
so
you
have
no
longer
any
excuse
for
not
marrying
young
monsieur
de
i
do
not
wish
to
destroy
my
mother
s
happiness
retorted
rosalie
satan
exclaimed
the
towards
the
end
of
that
winter
the
worthy
abbe
de
grancey
died
this
good
friend
no
longer
stood
between
madame
de
watteville
and
her
daughter
to
soften
the
impact
of
those
two
iron
wills
the
event
he
had
foretold
took
place
in
the
month
of
august
madame
de
watteville
was
married
to
monsieur
de
soulas
in
paris
whither
she
went
by
rosalie
s
advice
the
girl
making
a
show
of
kindness
and
sweetness
to
her
mother
madame
de
watteville
believed
in
this
affection
on
the
part
of
her
daughter
who
simply
desired
to
go
to
paris
to
give
herself
the
luxury
of
a
bitter
revenge
she
thought
of
nothing
but
avenging
savarus
by
torturing
her
rival
mademoiselle
de
watteville
had
been
declared
legally
of
age
she
was
in
fact
not
far
from
her
mother
to
settle
with
her
finally
had
resigned
her
claims
on
les
rouxey
and
the
daughter
had
signed
a
release
for
all
the
inheritance
of
the
baron
de
watteville
rosalie
encouraged
her
mother
to
marry
the
comte
de
soulas
and
settle
all
her
own
fortune
on
him
let
us
each
be
perfectly
free
she
said
madame
de
soulas
who
had
been
uneasy
as
to
her
daughter
s
intentions
was
touched
by
this
liberality
and
made
her
a
present
of
six
thousand
francs
a
year
in
the
funds
as
conscience
money
as
the
comtesse
de
soulas
had
an
income
of
thousand
francs
from
her
own
lands
and
was
quite
incapable
of
alienating
them
in
order
to
diminish
rosalie
s
share
mademoiselle
de
watteville
was
still
a
fortune
to
marry
of
eighteen
hundred
thousand
francs
les
rouxey
with
the
baron
s
additions
and
certain
improvements
might
yield
twenty
thousand
francs
a
year
besides
the
value
of
the
house
rents
and
preserves
so
rosalie
and
her
mother
who
soon
adopted
the
paris
style
and
fashions
easily
obtained
introductions
to
the
best
society
the
golden
key
eighteen
hundred
thousand
francs
embroidered
on
mademoiselle
de
watteville
s
stomacher
did
more
for
the
comtesse
de
soulas
than
her
pretensions
de
rupt
her
inappropriate
pride
or
even
her
rather
distant
great
connections
in
the
month
of
february
rosalie
who
was
eagerly
courted
by
many
young
men
achieved
the
purpose
which
had
brought
her
to
paris
this
was
to
meet
the
duchesse
de
rhetore
to
see
this
wonderful
woman
and
to
overwhelm
her
with
perennial
remorse
rosalie
gave
herself
up
to
the
most
bewildering
elegance
and
vanities
in
order
to
face
the
duchess
on
an
equal
footing
they
first
met
at
a
ball
given
annually
after
for
the
benefit
of
the
pensioners
on
the
old
civil
list
a
young
man
prompted
by
rosalie
pointed
her
out
to
the
duchess
saying
there
is
a
very
remarkable
young
person
a
young
lady
too
she
drove
a
clever
man
into
a
monastery
the
grand
chartreuse
a
man
of
immense
capabilities
albert
de
savarus
whose
career
she
wrecked
she
is
mademoiselle
de
watteville
the
famous
besancon
heiress
the
duchess
turned
pale
rosalie
s
eyes
met
hers
with
one
of
those
flashes
which
between
woman
and
woman
are
more
fatal
than
the
pistol
shots
of
a
duel
francesca
soderini
who
had
suspected
that
albert
might
be
innocent
hastily
quitted
the
ballroom
leaving
the
speaker
at
his
wits
end
to
guess
what
terrible
blow
he
had
inflicted
on
the
beautiful
duchesse
de
rhetore
if
you
want
to
hear
more
about
albert
come
to
the
opera
ball
on
tuesday
with
a
marigold
in
your
this
anonymous
note
sent
by
rosalie
to
the
duchess
brought
the
unhappy
italian
to
the
ball
where
mademoiselle
de
watteville
placed
in
her
hand
all
albert
s
letters
with
that
written
to
leopold
hannequin
by
the
and
the
notary
s
reply
and
even
that
in
which
she
had
written
her
confession
to
the
abbe
de
grancey
i
do
not
choose
to
be
the
only
sufferer
she
said
to
her
rival
for
one
has
been
as
ruthless
as
the
after
enjoying
the
dismay
stamped
on
the
duchess
beautiful
face
rosalie
went
away
she
went
out
no
more
and
returned
to
besancon
with
her
mother
mademoiselle
de
watteville
who
lived
alone
on
her
estate
of
les
rouxey
riding
hunting
refusing
two
or
three
offers
a
year
going
to
besancon
four
or
five
times
in
the
course
of
the
winter
and
busying
herself
with
improving
her
land
was
regarded
as
a
very
eccentric
personage
she
was
one
of
the
celebrities
of
the
eastern
provinces
madame
de
soulas
has
two
children
a
boy
and
a
girl
and
she
has
grown
younger
but
monsieur
de
soulas
has
aged
a
good
deal
my
fortune
has
cost
me
dear
said
he
to
young
chavoncourt
really
to
know
a
bigot
it
is
unfortunately
necessary
to
marry
her
mademoiselle
de
watteville
behaves
in
the
most
extraordinary
manner
she
has
vagaries
people
say
every
year
she
goes
to
gaze
at
the
walls
of
the
grande
chartreuse
perhaps
she
dreams
of
imitating
her
by
forcing
the
walls
of
the
monastery
to
find
a
husband
as
watteville
broke
through
those
of
his
monastery
to
recover
his
liberty
she
left
besancon
in
intending
it
was
said
to
get
married
but
the
real
reason
of
this
expedition
is
still
unknown
for
she
returned
home
in
a
state
which
forbids
her
ever
appearing
in
society
again
by
one
of
those
chances
of
which
the
abbe
de
grancey
had
spoken
she
happened
to
be
on
the
loire
in
a
steamboat
of
which
the
boiler
burst
mademoiselle
de
watteville
was
so
severely
injured
that
she
lost
her
right
arm
and
her
left
leg
her
face
is
marked
with
fearful
scars
which
have
bereft
her
of
her
beauty
her
health
cruelly
upset
leaves
her
few
days
free
from
suffering
in
short
she
now
never
leaves
the
chartreuse
of
les
rouxey
where
she
leads
a
life
wholly
devoted
to
religious
practices
