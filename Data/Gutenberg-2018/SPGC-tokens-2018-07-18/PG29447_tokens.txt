the

once
upon
a
time
there
lived
a
king
called
bubi
the
first
who
was
very
kind
to
poor
children
and
mice
for
the
children
he
built
a
factory
for
making
dolls
and
cardboard
horses
for
the
benefit
of
the
mice
he
made
wise
laws
to
stop
cats
catching
them
and
absolutely
forbade
the
use
of
bubi
began
to
reign
when
he
was
only
six
years
old
under
the
care
of
his
mother
who
was
very
good
and
clever
and
who
watched
over
him
and
guided
his
steps
as
good
children
are
guided
by
their
guardian
angel
illustration
the
oldest
of
the
court
doctors
bubi
was
a
darling
little
boy
and
when
on
great
days
they
put
on
his
gold
crown
and
his
embroidered
robes
the
gold
of
his
crown
was
not
brighter
than
his
hair
nor
the
ermine
of
his
robes
softer
than
his
cheeks
and
hands
he
was
just
like
a
little
dresden
china
figure
which
had
been
put
to
sit
on
a
throne
instead
of
standing
on
the
chimney
piece
one
day
while
the
king
was
eating
his
bread
and
milk
one
of
his
teeth
began
to
wobble
there
was
a
great
fuss
and
the
court
doctors
arrived
in
a
hurry
they
were
all
agreed
that
his
majesty
had
begun
to
change
his
teeth
and
at
length
they
settled
to
pull
out
the
loose
one
they
wanted
the
king
to
have
laughing
gas
as
he
did
when
his
hair
was
cut
as
he
always
fidgeted
so
but
bubi
was
a
brave
little
boy
and
made
up
his
mind
to
have
it
out
with
nothing
the
oldest
of
the
court
doctors
tied
a
bit
of
red
silk
round
the
tooth
and
then
gave
a
tweak
and
he
pulled
so
cleverly
that
while
the
king
was
making
a
face
out
came
the
tooth
as
round
and
white
as
a
little
pearl
then
there
was
another
fuss
as
to
what
was
to
be
done
with
it
but
bubi
mother
who
as
we
have
said
was
a
very
wise
queen
and
very
loyal
to
old
customs
settled
that
the
king
should
write
a
very
polite
letter
and
put
it
with
the
tooth
in
an
envelope
under
his
pillow
that
night
which
has
always
been
the
proper
thing
to
do
ever
since
the
world
began
and
no
one
has
ever
known
perez
the
mouse
forget
to
come
and
fetch
the
tooth
and
leave
a
lovely
present
in
its
place
illustration
miss
stilton
the
governess
king
bubi
found
writing
that
letter
a
dreadful
task
but
he
managed
really
quite
well
in
the
end
and
only
inked
all
his
fingers
the
tip
of
his
nose
his
left
ear
his
right
shoe
and
his
bib
he
went
to
bed
very
early
that
evening
and
ordered
that
all
the
lights
should
be
left
in
his
room
he
put
the
envelope
under
his
pillow
and
sat
up
in
bed
determined
to
keep
awake
to
see
perez
the
mouse
even
if
he
had
to
wait
all
night
silhouette
perez
the
mouse
was
a
long
time
coming
so
the
little
king
began
to
make
up
a
little
speech
to
say
to
him
when
he
did
arrive
after
a
bit
bubi
began
to
open
his
eyes
very
wide
fighting
against
the
miller
who
was
trying
to
make
him
shut
them
but
they
did
shut
at
last
and
the
little
boy
slipped
down
into
the
warm
his
head
on
the
pillow
with
one
arm
over
it
as
a
little
bird
tucks
its
head
under
its
wing
when
it
goes
to
sleep
suddenly
he
felt
something
very
soft
just
tickling
his
forehead
and
sitting
up
quickly
he
saw
in
front
of
him
standing
on
the
pillow
a
tiny
little
mouse
in
a
straw
hat
and
slippers
and
big
gold
spectacles
a
red
satchel
was
slung
across
his
back

tiny
little
mouse

king
bubi
stared
at
him
in
astonishment
and
perez
the
mouse
seeing
that
his
majesty
was
awake
took
off
his
hat
and
made
a
very
low
bow
waiting
to
be
spoken
to
but
the
king
said
nothing
because
he
had
quite
forgotten
all
he
had
made
up
to
say
and
after
thinking
and
thinking
he
faltered
out
at
last
night
perez
answered
with
a
low
bow
give
your
majesty
a
very
good
one
these
civil
speeches
quite
broke
the
ice
and
the
king
and
the
mouse
became
the
greatest
friends
it
was
easy
to
see
that
perez
was
a
mouse
who
was
accustomed
to
polite
society
and
to
run
about
on
soft
carpets
as
he
had
such
very
good
manners
it
was
wonderful
what
a
lot
of
things
he
could
talk
about
which
made
him
a
very
pleasant
companion
he
had
travelled
through
all
the
pipes
and
drains
of
the
capital
and
in
the
royal
library
alone
he
had
eaten
up
three
books
in
less
than
a
week
he
talked
too
about
his
family
he
had
two
quite
daughters
adelaide
and
elvira
and
a
son
nearly
grown
up
called
adolphus
who
was
studying
for
diplomacy
in
the
drawer
where
the
minister
of
state
kept
his
most
secret
notes
he
did
not
say
much
about
mrs
mouse
and
the
little
king
somehow
fancied
that
she
was
rather
vulgar
illustration
adolphus
studying
for
diplomacy
his
majesty
listened
to
all
this
with
his
mouth
open
from
time
to
time
he
put
out
his
hand
to
try
and
catch
perez
by
the
tail
but
each
time
the
mouse
gave
a
sort
of
whisk
and
placed
his
tail
out
of
reach
without
being
in
the
least
rude
illustration
adelaide
made
tea
it
was
getting
late
and
the
king
forgot
to
dismiss
him
so
mr
mouse
cleverly
hinted
that
he
had
to
go
that
same
night
to
a
street
not
far
off
to
fetch
the
tooth
of
a
very
poor
little
boy
called
giles
it
was
rather
a
difficult
dangerous
journey
because
near
there
lived
a
very
wicked
cat
called
don
pedro
the
king
at
once
wanted
to
go
too
and
begged
perez
to
take
him
the
mouse
stood
thinking
it
over
and
twisting
his
whiskers
the
responsibility
was
very
great
and
moreover
he
was
obliged
to
go
back
to
his
own
house
to
fetch
the
present
for
little
giles
the
king
said
he
would
like
to
go
and
see
the
mouse
home
which
so
much
flattered
perez
that
he
at
once
offered
him
a
cup
of
tea
and
agreed
to
take
him
to
see
little
giles
perez
the
mouse
lived
underneath
a
grocer
shop
near
a
big
pile
of
gruyere
cheeses
which
supplied
the
whole
family
with
breakfast
dinner
and
tea
overjoyed
king
bubi
jumped
out
of
bed
and
began
to
dress
himself
when
all
at
once
perez
the
mouse
sprang
on
his
shoulder
and
put
the
tip
of
his
tail
into
his
majesty
nose
then
a
wonderful
thing
happened
the
king
sneezed
very
hard
and
turned
into
the
most
darling
little
mouse
you
ever
saw
he
was
all
soft
and
shiny
and
had
wee
green
eyes
like
emeralds
perez
the
mouse
took
him
by
the
paw
and
disappeared
with
him
down
a
tiny
hole
under
the
bed
which
had
been
hidden
by
the
carpet
illustration
the
king
sneezed
very
hard
and
turned
into
the
most
darling
little
mouse
you
ever
saw
the
way
was
dark
and
sticky
but
they
scampered
along
sometimes
perez
the
mouse
stopped
at
some
crossway
and
looked
about
before
going
on
which
rather
frightened
the
king
and
made
him
feel
little
shivers
right
down
to
the
tip
of
his
tail
and
he
knew
that
he
was
afraid
but
he
remembered
that
is
natural
to
the
prudent
to
conquer
it
is
to
be
courageous
so
he
would
not
let
himself
be
frightened
which
is
being
really
brave
once
when
he
heard
a
tremendous
noise
like
dozens
of
motor
omnibuses
passing
over
his
head
he
whispered
to
ask
perez
if
that
was
where
don
pedro
lived
but
mr
mouse
said
no
with
his
tail
and
on
they
went
after
going
down
a
gentle
slope
they
came
to
a
big
cellar
which
felt
nice
and
warm
and
smelt
very
much
of
cheese
behind
a
pile
of
gruyere
cheese
they
found
themselves
face
to
face
with
the
huntley
and
palmer
biscuit
tin
which
was
the
home
of
the
perez
family
here
they
lived
as
happily
as
the
rat
of
fable
did
in
the
dutch
cheese
perez
the
mouse
introduced
the
king
as
a
foreign
tourist
who
was
on
a
visit
to
the
capital
and
the
family
welcomed
him
very
cordially
the
two
miss
mouses
were
at
work
with
their
governess
miss
stilton
who
was
a
very
learned
english
mouse
and
mrs
mouse
was
embroidering
a
beautiful
smoking
cap
for
her
husband
sitting
by
a
bright
fire
made
of
raisin
stalks
this
happy
family
party
delighted
king
bubi
adelaide
and
elvira
made
tea
and
poured
out
some
into
lovely
wee
cups
made
out
of
the
skins
of
white
beans
then
they
had
a
little
music
adelaide
sang
desdemona
song
willow
willow
in
a
way
which
much
pleased
the
king
and
elvira
recited
about
a
little
mouse
who
was
ill
of
fever
and
a
naughty
kitten
who
wanted
to
pounce
on
it
after
this
adolphus
came
in
from
the
jockey
club
where
to
the
sorrow
of
his
father
and
mother
he
wasted
all
his
time
playing
cards
with
the
mice
from
the
foreign
embassies

perez
the
mouse
stopped
at
some
crossway
king
bubi
would
willingly
have
stayed
longer
but
perez
who
had
slipped
away
came
back
with
his
satchel
on
his
back
and
said
it
was
time
to
start
so
the
king
said
goodbye
very
politely
and
mrs
mouse
gave
him
a
kiss
on
each
cheek
in
her
homely
way
adelaide
put
out
a
paw
in
a
lackadaisical
fashion
and
elvira
shook
hands
like
a
pump
handle
while
miss
stilton
made
him
a
beautiful
cheese
of
a
curtsey
and
then
stared
at
him
through
her
eyeglass
until
he
was
out
of
sight
adolphus
too
was
very
gushing
and
conducted
him
as
far
as
the
lid
of
the
tin
and
offered
to
introduce
him
at
the
polo
club
for
which
the
king
thanked
him
very
much
thinking
all
the
time
that
though
he
might
be
a
very
smart
young
mouse
he
was
rather
a
bore
then
bubi
and
perez
the
mouse
again
began
their
scamper
with
such
a
quantity
of
precautions
that
the
king
was
astonished
illustration
mrs
mouse
was
embroidering
a
beautiful
smoking
cap
for
her
husband
in
front
of
them
went
a
regiment
of
ferocious
mice
soldiers
whose
bayonets
made
of
fine
needles
gleamed
in
the
darkness
behind
them
came
a
second
regiment
also
armed
to
the
teeth
perez
the
mouse
then
confessed
that
he
would
not
have
undertaken
this
expedition
without
these
soldiers
to
protect
the
person
of
the
young
monarch
all
of
a
sudden
king
bubi
saw
the
guard
in
front
had
disappeared
down
a
little
hole
through
which
came
a
faint
light
illustration
adolphus
playing
cards
at
the
jockey
club
this
was
the
moment
of
danger
perez
the
mouse
slowly
waggling
his
tail
from
side
to
side
put
his
head
very
cautiously
through
the
hole
and
looked
around
he
then
went
back
two
steps
and
finally
suddenly
seizing
the
king
paw
dashed
through
the
hole
like
an
arrow
crossed
a
big
kitchen
and
disappeared
through
another
hole
on
the
opposite
side
near
the
range
as
one
sees
telegraph
posts
out
of
the
train
so
bubi
saw
that
kitchen
by
the
hearth
in
the
glow
of
the
fire
lay
an
enormous
cat
the
dreadful
don
pedro
its
great
whiskers
heaving
up
and
down

it
breathed

up

was
all
very
grand

imposing
an
ugly
old
woman
sat
in
a
chair
also
asleep
with
her
knitting
on
her
knee
once
through
the
hole
the
danger
was
over
and
they
had
only
to
get
upstairs
as
this
was
where
little
giles
lived
everything
was
open
in
his
poor
room
which
was
all
cracks
and
draughts
king
bubi
scrambled
on
to
the
arm
of
a
seatless
chair
the
only
one
in
the
room
and
from
there
could
see
a
picture
of
poverty
such
as
he
had
never
dreamt
of
the
sloping
roof
joined
the
floor
so
that
on
one
side
a
man
could
not
have
stood
upright
and
through
the
holes
the
cold
air
of
dawn
was
coming
while
icicles
hung
from
the
roof
the
only
furniture
besides
the
chair
was
an
empty
bread
basket
hanging
up
and
in
a
corner
a
bed
of
straw
and
rags
on
which
little
giles
and
his
mother
were
lying
fast
asleep
perez
the
mouse
drew
nearer
taking
the
king
by
the
paw
and
they
could
see
how
little
giles
was
huddled
up
in
the
rags
and
how
he
was
cuddled
up
against
his
mother
for
warmth
and
it
made
the
king
so
unhappy
that
he
began
to
cry
illustration
the
guards
silently
formed
up
ready
to
fire
why
had
he
never
known
that
people
were
so
poor
how
was
it
that
he
had
never
been
told
that
children
were
hungry
and
had
to
sleep
on
horrid
beds
he
did
not

any

had
plenty

then
tried

showing
him
the
bright

coin
he
was
going

put
under

sat
up
in

looked
at

was
still
asleep
it
was
becoming
light
and
she
had
to
earn
some
money
by
washing
clothes
in
the
river
she
caught
the
sleeping
giles
in
her
arms
and
made
him
kneel
down
under
a
picture
of
the
infant
christ
which
was
pinned
to
the
wall
near

knelt
down
too

looked
at

understood
his
astonishment
and
fixed
his
piercing
eyes
on
him

never

single
word

the
return
journey

were
silent

home
in

again
put
the
tip
of
his
tail
into
bubi
nose
and
made
him
sneeze
all
at
once
he
found
himself
safely
back
again
in
his
own
warm
little
cot
with
the
queen
arms
round
him
who
woke
him
as
she
always
did
with
a
kiss
illustration
the
order
of
the
golden
fleece
at
first
he
thought
it
had
all
been
a
dream
but
when
he
looked
for
the
letter
he
had
put
under
his
pillow
he
found
it
was
gone
and
in
its
place
was
a
case
with
the
order
of
the
golden
fleece
in
diamonds
a
magnificent
present
from
the
generous
perez
the
mouse
in
exchange
for
his
first
tooth
perhaps
i
had
better
explain
to
english
children
that
in
king
bubi
country
the
order
of
the
golden
fleece
is
like
our
order
of
the
garter
the
greatest
honour
the
king
can
give
illustration
the
king
and
perez
the
mouse
knelt
down
too
the
little
king
however
paid
no
attention
to
his
beautiful
present
and
let
it
lie
unnoticed
on
the
bed
while
leaning
on
his
elbow
he
lay
very
busy
thinking
then
suddenly
he
asked
the
queen
in
a
very
solemn
voice
why
do
poor
children
say
the
same
prayer
as
i
do
our
father
which
art
in
heaven
the
queen
answered
he
is
as
much
their
father
as
he
is
yours
then
said
the
king
thoughtfully
must
be
brothers
my
darling
they
are
your
brothers
answered
the
queen
bubi
eyes
were
filled
with
astonishment
and
in
a
choky
voice
he
asked
why
am
i
a
king
and
have
everything
i
want
while
they
are
poor
and
have
nothing
the
queen
gave
him
a
squeeze
and
kissing
him
again
on
his
forehead
said
you
are
the
eldest
brother
which
is
what
being
king
really
means
you
understand
darling
god
has
given
you
everything
in
order
that
your
younger
brothers
should
want
for
nothing
never
knew
this
before
said
bubi
shaking
his
head
and
without
thinking
any
more
about
his
present
he
began
to
say
his
prayers
as
he
did
every
morning
and
as
he
prayed
it
seemed
to
him
that
all
the
poor
little
boys
in
the
kingdom
came
round
him
with
their
hands
clasped
and
that
he
the
eldest
brother
spoke
for
them
all
when
he
prayed
father
which
art
in
heaven
king
bubi
grew
up
to
be
a
great
ruler
he
always
asked
help
in
all
he
did
and
returned
thanks
for
his
happiness
ever
saying
speaking
for
all
his
subjects
poor
and
rich
good
and
bad
father
which
art
in
heaven
and
when
he
died
a
very
old
man
and
his
good
soul
arrived
at
the
gates
of
heaven
he
knelt
down
and
prayed
as
usual
father
and
as
he
prayed
the
gates
were
opened
wide
by
thousands
of
poor
little
children
to
whom
he
had
been
king
that
is
to
say
eldest
brother

but
i
can
not
help
adding
that
it
does
seem
a
pity
not
to
try

get
perez

to
come
to

the
only
way
to
manage
this
will
be
to
take
great
pains
over
your
copies
and
spelling
so
that
when
your
first
tooth
comes
out
you
will
be
able
to
write
a
nice
tidy
polite
letter
to
him
if
you
put
it
under
your
pillow
at
night
i
am
nearly
sure
you
will
find
it
gone
and
a
present
in
its
place
in
the
morning
perhaps
you
may
even
feel
the
same
little
soft
tickle
on
your
forehead
that
king
bubi
did

do
not

for
