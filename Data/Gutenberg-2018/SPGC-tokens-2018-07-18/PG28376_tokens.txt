mamma
what
was
that
i
heard
papa
saying
to
you
this
morning
about
his
lawsuit
i
can
not
tell
you
just
now
ellen
pick
up
that
shawl
and
spread
it
over
me
mamma
are
you
cold
in
this
warm
room
a
little
there
that
will
do
now
my
daughter
let
me
be
quiet
awhile
do
disturb
me
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
room
driven
thus
to
her
own
resources
ellen
betook
herself
to
the
window
and
sought
amusement
there
the
prospect
without
gave
little
promise
of
it
rain
was
falling
and
made
the
street
and
everything
in
it
look
dull
and
gloomy
the
plashed
through
the
water
and
the
horses
and
carriages
plashed
through
the
mud
gaiety
had
forsaken
the
and
equipages
were
few
and
the
people
that
were
out
were
plainly
there
only
because
they
could
not
help
it
but
yet
ellen
having
seriously
set
herself
to
study
everything
that
passed
presently
became
engaged
in
her
occupation
and
her
thoughts
travelling
dreamily
from
one
thing
to
another
she
sat
for
a
long
time
with
her
little
face
pressed
against
the
perfectly
regardless
of
all
but
the
moving
world
without
daylight
gradually
faded
away
and
the
street
wore
a
more
and
more
gloomy
aspect
the
rain
poured
and
now
only
an
occasional
carriage
or
footstep
disturbed
the
sound
of
its
steady
pattering
yet
still
ellen
sat
with
her
face
glued
to
the
window
as
if
gazing
out
at
every
dusky
form
that
passed
as
though
it
had
some
strange
interest
for
her
at
length
in
the
distance
light
after
light
began
to
appear
presently
ellen
could
see
the
dim
figure
of
the
lamplighter
crossing
the
street
from
side
to
side
with
his
ladder
then
he
drew
near
enough
for
her
to
watch
him
as
he
hooked
his
ladder
on
the
ran
up
and
lit
the
lamp
then
shouldered
the
ladder
and
marched
off
quick
the
light
glancing
on
his
wet
hat
rough
greatcoat
and
lantern
and
on
the
pavement
and
iron
railings
the
veriest
moth
could
not
have
followed
the
light
with
more
perseverance
than
did
ellen
eyes
till
the
lamplighter
gradually
disappeared
from
view
and
the
last
lamp
she
could
see
was
lit
and
not
till
then
did
it
occur
to
her
that
there
was
such
a
place
as
indoors
she
took
her
face
from
the
window
the
room
was
dark
and
cheerless
and
ellen
felt
stiff
and
chilly
however
she
made
her
way
to
the
fire
and
having
found
the
poker
she
applied
it
gently
to
the
liverpool
coal
with
such
good
effect
that
a
bright
ruddy
blaze
sprang
up
and
lighted
the
whole
room
ellen
smiled
at
the
result
of
her
experiment
that
is
something
like
said
she
to
herself
who
says
i
ca
poke
the
fire
now
let
us
see
if
i
ca
do
something
else
do
but
see
how
those
chairs
are
standing
one
would
think
we
had
had
a
sewing
circle
here
there
go
back
to
your
places
that
looks
a
little
better
now
these
curtains
must
come
down
and
i
may
as
well
shut
the
shutters
too
and
now
this
tablecloth
must
be
content
to
hang
straight
and
mamma
box
and
the
books
must
lie
in
their
places
and
not
all
now
i
wish
mamma
would
wake
up
i
should
think
she
might
i
do
believe
she
is
asleep
she
do
look
as
if
she
was
ellen
was
right
in
this
her
mother
face
did
not
wear
the
look
of
sleep
nor
indeed
of
repose
at
all
the
lips
were
compressed
and
the
brow
not
calm
to
try
however
whether
she
was
asleep
or
no
and
with
the
intent
to
rouse
her
at
all
events
ellen
knelt
down
by
her
side
and
laid
her
face
close
to
her
mother
on
the
pillow
but
this
failed
to
draw
either
word
or
sign
after
a
minute
or
two
ellen
tried
stroking
her
mother
cheek
very
gently
and
this
succeeded
for
montgomery
arrested
the
little
hand
as
it
passed
her
lips
and
kissed
it
fondly
two
or
three
times
i
have
disturbed
you
mamma
have
i
said
ellen
without
replying
montgomery
raised
herself
to
a
sitting
posture
and
lifting
both
hands
to
her
face
pushed
back
the
hair
from
her
forehead
and
temples
with
a
gesture
which
ellen
knew
meant
that
she
was
making
up
her
mind
to
some
disagreeable
or
painful
effort
then
taking
both
ellen
hands
as
she
still
knelt
before
her
she
gazed
in
her
face
with
a
look
even
more
fond
than
usual
ellen
thought
but
much
sadder
too
though
montgomery
cheerfulness
had
always
been
of
a
serious
kind
what
question
was
that
you
were
asking
me
awhile
ago
my
daughter
i
thought
mamma
i
heard
papa
telling
you
this
morning
or
yesterday
that
he
had
lost
that
lawsuit
you
heard
right
ellen
he
has
lost
it
said
montgomery
sadly
are
you
sorry
mamma
does
it
trouble
you
you
know
my
dear
that
i
am
not
apt
to
concern
myself
overmuch
about
the
gain
or
the
loss
of
money
i
believe
my
heavenly
father
will
give
me
what
is
good
for
me
then
mamma
why
are
you
troubled
because
my
child
i
can
not
carry
out
this
principle
in
other
matters
and
leave
quietly
my
in
his
hands
what
is
the
matter
dear
mother
what
makes
you
look
so
this
lawsuit
ellen
has
brought
upon
us
more
trouble
than
ever
i
thought
a
lawsuit
could
the
loss
of
it
i
mean
how
mamma
it
has
caused
an
entire
change
of
all
our
plans
your
father
says
he
is
too
poor
now
to
stay
here
any
longer
and
he
has
agreed
to
go
soon
on
some
government
or
military
business
to
europe
well
mamma
that
is
bad
but
he
has
been
away
a
great
deal
before
and
i
am
sure
we
were
always
very
happy
but
ellen
he
thinks
now
and
the
doctor
thinks
too
that
it
is
very
important
for
my
health
that
i
should
go
with
him
does
he
mamma
and
do
you
mean
to
go
i
am
afraid
i
must
my
dear
child
not
and
leave
mother
the
imploring
look
of
mingled
astonishment
terror
and
sorrow
with
which
ellen
uttered
these
words
took
from
her
mother
all
power
of
replying
it
was
not
necessary
her
little
daughter
understood
only
too
well
the
silent
answer
of
her
eye
with
a
wild
cry
she
flung
her
arms
round
her
mother
and
hiding
her
face
in
her
lap
gave
way
to
a
violent
burst
of
grief
that
seemed
for
a
few
moments
as
if
it
would
rend
soul
and
body
in
twain
for
her
passions
were
by
nature
very
strong
and
by
education
very
imperfectly
controlled
and
time
that
rider
that
breaks
youth
had
not
as
yet
tried
his
hand
upon
her
and
montgomery
in
spite
of
the
fortitude
and
calmness
to
which
she
had
steeled
herself
bent
down
over
her
and
folding
her
arms
about
her
yielded
to
sorrow
deeper
still
and
for
a
little
while
scarcely
less
violent
in
its
expression
than
ellen
own
alas
she
had
too
good
reason
she
knew
that
the
chance
of
her
ever
returning
to
shield
the
little
creature
who
was
nearest
her
heart
from
the
future
evils
and
snares
of
life
was
very
very
small
she
had
at
first
absolutely
refused
to
leave
ellen
when
her
husband
proposed
it
declaring
that
she
would
rather
stay
with
her
and
die
than
take
the
chance
of
recovery
at
such
a
cost
but
her
physician
assured
her
she
could
not
live
long
without
a
change
of
climate
captain
montgomery
urged
that
it
was
better
to
submit
to
a
temporary
separation
than
to
cling
obstinately
to
her
child
for
a
few
months
and
then
leave
her
for
ever
said
he
must
himself
go
speedily
to
france
and
that
now
was
her
best
opportunity
assuring
her
however
that
his
circumstances
would
not
permit
him
to
take
ellen
along
but
that
she
would
be
secure
of
a
happy
home
with
his
sister
during
her
mother
absence
and
to
the
pressure
of
argument
captain
montgomery
added
the
weight
of
authority
insisting
on
her
compliance
conscience
also
asked
montgomery
whether
she
had
a
to
neglect
any
chance
of
life
that
was
offered
her
and
at
last
she
yielded
to
the
combined
influence
of
motives
no
one
of
which
would
have
had
power
sufficient
to
move
her
and
though
with
a
secret
consciousness
it
would
be
in
vain
she
consented
to
do
as
her
friends
wished
and
it
was
for
ellen
sake
she
did
it
after
all
nothing
but
necessity
had
given
her
the
courage
to
open
the
matter
to
her
little
daughter
she
had
foreseen
and
endeavoured
to
prepare
herself
for
ellen
anguish
but
nature
was
too
strong
for
her
and
they
clasped
each
other
in
a
convulsive
embrace
while
tears
fell
like
rain
it
was
some
minutes
before
montgomery
recollected
herself
and
then
though
she
struggled
hard
she
could
not
immediately
regain
her
composure
but
ellen
deep
sobs
at
length
fairly
alarmed
her
she
saw
the
necessity
for
both
their
sakes
of
putting
a
stop
to
this
state
of
violent
excitement
was
restored
at
once
ellen
ellen
listen
to
me
she
said
my
child
this
is
not
right
remember
my
darling
who
it
is
that
brings
this
sorrow
upon
us
though
we
sorrow
we
must
not
rebel
ellen
sobbed
more
gently
but
that
and
the
mute
pressure
of
her
arms
was
her
only
answer
you
will
hurt
both
yourself
and
me
my
daughter
if
you
can
not
command
yourself
remember
dear
ellen
god
sends
no
trouble
upon
his
children
but
in
love
and
though
we
can
not
see
how
he
will
no
doubt
make
all
this
work
for
our
good
i
know
it
dear
mother
sobbed
ellen
but
it
just
as
hard
montgomery
own
heart
answered
so
readily
to
the
truth
of
words
that
for
the
moment
she
could
not
speak
try
my
daughter
she
said
after
a
pause
try
to
compose
yourself
i
am
afraid
you
will
make
me
worse
ellen
if
you
can
not
i
am
indeed
ellen
had
plenty
of
faults
but
amidst
them
all
love
to
her
mother
was
the
strongest
feeling
her
heart
knew
it
had
power
enough
now
to
move
her
as
nothing
else
could
have
done
and
exerting
all
her
of
which
she
had
sometimes
a
good
deal
she
calm
herself
ceased
sobbing
wiped
her
eyes
arose
from
her
crouching
posture
and
seating
herself
on
the
sofa
by
her
mother
and
laying
her
head
on
her
bosom
she
listened
quietly
to
all
the
soothing
words
and
cheering
considerations
with
which
montgomery
endeavoured
to
lead
her
to
take
a
more
hopeful
view
of
the
subject
all
she
could
urge
however
had
but
very
partial
success
though
the
conversation
was
prolonged
far
into
the
evening
ellen
said
little
and
did
not
weep
any
more
but
in
secret
her
heart
refused
consolation
long
before
this
the
servant
had
brought
in
the
nobody
regarded
it
at
the
time
but
the
little
kettle
hissing
away
on
the
fire
now
by
chance
attracted
ellen
attention
and
she
suddenly
recollected
her
mother
had
had
no
tea
to
make
her
mother
tea
was
ellen
regular
business
she
treated
it
as
a
very
grave
affair
and
loved
it
as
one
of
the
pleasantest
in
the
course
of
the
day
she
used
in
the
first
place
to
make
sure
that
the
kettle
had
really
boiled
then
she
carefully
poured
some
water
into
the
teapot
and
rinsed
it
both
to
make
it
clean
and
to
make
it
hot
then
she
knew
exactly
how
much
tea
to
put
into
the
tiny
little
teapot
which
was
just
big
enough
to
hold
two
cups
of
tea
and
having
poured
a
very
little
boiling
water
to
it
she
used
to
set
it
by
the
side
of
the
fire
while
she
made
half
a
slice
of
toast
how
careful
ellen
was
about
that
toast
the
bread
must
not
be
cut
too
thick
nor
too
thin
the
fire
must
if
possible
burn
clear
and
bright
and
she
herself
held
the
bread
on
a
fork
just
at
the
right
distance
from
the
coals
to
get
nicely
browned
without
burning
when
this
was
done
to
her
satisfaction
and
if
the
first
piece
failed
she
would
take
another
she
filled
up
the
little
teapot
from
the
boiling
kettle
and
proceeded
to
make
a
cup
of
tea
she
knew
and
was
very
careful
to
put
in
just
the
quantity
of
milk
and
sugar
that
her
mother
liked
and
then
she
used
to
carry
the
tea
and
toast
on
a
little
tray
to
her
mother
side
and
very
often
held
it
there
for
her
while
she
ate
all
this
ellen
did
with
the
zeal
that
love
gives
and
though
the
same
thing
was
to
be
gone
over
every
night
of
the
year
she
was
never
wearied
it
was
a
real
pleasure
she
had
the
greatest
satisfaction
in
seeing
that
the
little
her
mother
could
eat
was
prepared
for
her
in
the
nicest
possible
manner
she
knew
her
hands
made
it
taste
better
her
mother
often
said
so
but
this
evening
other
thoughts
had
driven
this
important
business
quite
out
of
poor
ellen
mind
now
however
when
her
eyes
fell
upon
the
little
kettle
she
recollected
her
mother
had
not
had
her
tea
and
must
want
it
very
much
and
silently
slipping
off
the
sofa
she
set
about
getting
it
as
usual
there
was
no
doubt
this
time
whether
the
kettle
boiled
or
no
it
had
been
hissing
for
an
hour
and
more
calling
as
loud
as
it
could
to
somebody
to
come
and
make
the
tea
so
ellen
made
it
and
then
began
the
toast
but
she
began
to
think
too
as
she
watched
it
how
few
more
times
she
would
be
able
to
do
so
how
soon
her
pleasant
would
be
over
and
the
desolate
feeling
of
separation
began
to
come
upon
her
before
the
time
these
thoughts
were
too
much
for
poor
ellen
the
thick
tears
gathered
so
fast
she
could
not
see
what
she
was
doing
and
she
had
no
more
than
just
turned
the
slice
of
bread
on
the
fork
when
the
sickness
of
heart
quite
overcame
her
she
could
not
go
on
toast
and
fork
and
all
dropped
from
her
hand
into
the
ashes
and
rushing
to
her
mother
side
who
was
now
lying
down
again
and
throwing
herself
upon
her
she
burst
into
another
fit
of
sorrow
not
so
violent
as
the
former
but
with
a
touch
of
hopelessness
in
it
which
went
yet
more
to
her
mother
heart
passion
in
the
first
said
i
can
not
despair
now
seemed
to
say
i
must
but
montgomery
was
too
exhausted
to
either
share
or
soothe
agitation
she
lay
in
suffering
silence
till
after
some
time
she
said
faintly
ellen
my
love
i
can
not
bear
this
much
longer
ellen
was
immediately
brought
to
herself
by
these
words
she
arose
sorry
and
ashamed
that
she
should
have
given
occasion
for
them
and
tenderly
kissing
her
mother
assured
her
most
sincerely
and
resolutely
that
she
would
not
do
so
again
in
a
few
minutes
she
was
calm
enough
to
finish
making
the
tea
and
having
toasted
another
piece
of
bread
she
brought
it
to
her
mother
montgomery
swallowed
a
cup
of
tea
but
no
toast
could
be
eaten
that
night
both
remained
silent
and
quiet
awhile
after
this
till
the
clock
struck
ten
you
had
better
go
to
bed
my
daughter
said
montgomery
i
will
mamma
do
you
think
you
can
read
me
a
little
before
you
go
yes
indeed
mamma
and
ellen
brought
the
book
where
shall
i
read
the
psalm
ellen
began
it
and
went
through
it
steadily
and
slowly
though
her
voice
quavered
a
little
lord
is
my
shepherd
i
shall
not
want
maketh
me
to
lie
down
in
green
pastures
he
leadeth
me
beside
the
still
waters
restoreth
my
soul
he
leadeth
me
in
the
paths
of
righteousness
for
his
name
sake
i
walk
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
i
will
fear
no
evil
for
thou
art
with
me
thy
rod
and
thy
staff
they
comfort
me
preparest
a
table
before
me
in
the
presence
of
mine
enemies
thou
anointest
my
head
with
oil
my
cup
runneth
over
goodness
and
mercy
shall
follow
me
all
the
days
of
my
life
and
i
will
dwell
in
the
house
of
the
lord
for
ever
long
before
she
had
finished
ellen
eyes
were
full
and
her
heart
too
if
i
only
could
feel
these
words
as
mamma
does
she
said
to
herself
she
did
not
dare
look
up
till
the
traces
of
tears
had
passed
away
then
she
saw
that
her
mother
was
asleep
those
first
sweet
words
had
fallen
like
balm
upon
the
sore
heart
and
mind
and
body
had
instantly
found
rest
together
ellen
breathed
the
lightest
possible
kiss
upon
her
forehead
and
stole
quietly
out
of
the
room
to
her
own
little
bed
chapter
ii
not
all
the
whispers
that
the
soft
winds
utter
speak
earthly
things
there
mingleth
there
sometimes
a
gentle
flutter
of
angels
wings
amy
lathrop
sorrow
and
excitement
made
ellen
eyelids
heavy
and
she
slept
late
on
the
following
morning
the
great
waked
her
she
started
up
with
a
confused
notion
that
something
was
the
matter
there
was
a
weight
on
her
heart
that
was
very
strange
to
it
a
moment
was
enough
to
bring
it
all
back
and
she
threw
herself
again
on
her
pillow
yielding
helplessly
to
the
grief
she
had
twice
been
obliged
to
control
the
evening
before
yet
love
was
stronger
than
grief
still
and
she
was
careful
to
allow
no
sound
to
escape
her
that
could
reach
the
ears
of
her
mother
who
slept
in
the
next
room
her
resolve
was
firm
to
grieve
her
no
more
with
useless
expressions
of
sorrow
to
keep
it
to
herself
as
much
as
possible
but
this
very
thought
that
she
must
keep
it
to
herself
gave
an
edge
to
poor
ellen
grief
and
the
convulsive
clasp
of
her
little
arms
round
the
pillow
plainly
showed
that
it
needed
none
the
again
startled
her
and
she
remembered
she
must
not
be
too
late
downstairs
or
her
mother
might
inquire
and
find
out
the
reason
i
will
trouble
mother
i
will
not
i
will
not
she
resolved
to
herself
as
she
got
out
of
bed
though
the
tears
fell
faster
as
she
said
so
dressing
was
sad
work
to
ellen
it
went
on
very
heavily
tears
dropped
into
the
water
as
she
stooped
her
head
to
the
basin
and
she
hid
her
face
in
the
towel
to
cry
instead
of
making
the
ordinary
use
of
it
but
the
usual
duties
were
dragged
through
at
last
and
she
went
to
the
window
i
not
go
down
till
papa
is
gone
she
thought
he
ask
me
what
is
the
matter
with
my
eyes
ellen
opened
the
window
the
rain
was
over
the
lovely
light
of
a
fair
september
morning
was
beautifying
everything
it
shone
upon
ellen
had
been
accustomed
to
amuse
herself
a
good
deal
at
this
window
though
nothing
was
to
be
seen
from
it
but
an
ugly
city
prospect
of
back
walls
of
houses
with
the
yards
belonging
to
them
and
a
bit
of
narrow
street
but
she
had
watched
the
people
that
showed
themselves
at
the
windows
and
the
children
that
played
in
the
yards
and
the
women
that
went
to
the
pumps
till
she
had
become
pretty
well
acquainted
with
the
neighbourhood
and
though
they
were
for
the
most
part
dingy
dirty
and
disagreeable
women
children
houses
and
all
she
certainly
had
taken
a
good
deal
of
interest
in
their
proceedings
it
was
all
gone
now
she
could
not
bear
to
look
at
them
she
felt
as
if
it
made
her
sick
and
turning
away
her
eyes
she
lifted
them
to
the
bright
sky
above
her
head
and
gazed
into
its
clear
depth
of
blue
till
she
almost
forgot
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
a
city
in
the
world
little
white
clouds
were
chasing
across
it
driven
by
the
fresh
wind
that
was
blowing
away
ellen
hair
from
her
face
and
cooling
her
hot
cheeks
that
wind
could
not
have
been
long
in
coming
from
the
place
of
woods
and
flowers
it
was
so
sweet
still
ellen
looked
till
she
did
know
why
she
felt
calmed
and
soothed
as
if
somebody
was
saying
to
her
softly
cheer
up
my
child
cheer
up
things
are
not
as
bad
as
they
might
be
things
will
be
better
her
attention
was
attracted
at
length
by
voices
below
she
looked
down
and
saw
there
in
one
of
the
yards
a
poor
deformed
child
whom
she
had
often
noticed
before
and
always
with
sorrowful
interest
besides
his
bodily
infirmity
he
had
a
further
claim
on
her
sympathy
in
having
lost
his
mother
within
a
few
months
ellen
heart
was
easily
touched
this
morning
she
felt
for
him
very
much
poor
poor
little
fellow
she
thought
he
a
great
deal
worse
off
than
i
am
mother
is
dead
mine
is
only
going
away
for
a
few
months
not
for
ever
oh
what
a
difference
and
then
the
joy
of
coming
back
again
poor
ellen
was
weeping
already
at
the
thought
and
i
do
oh
how
much
while
she
is
gone
i
do
more
than
she
can
possibly
expect
from
me
i
astonish
her
i
delight
her
i
work
harder
than
ever
i
did
in
my
life
before
i
mend
all
my
faults
and
give
her
so
much
pleasure
but
oh
if
she
only
need
go
away
oh
mamma
tears
of
mingled
sweet
and
bitter
were
poured
out
fast
but
the
bitter
had
the
largest
share
the
was
still
standing
and
her
father
gone
when
ellen
went
downstairs
montgomery
welcomed
her
with
her
usual
quiet
smile
and
held
out
her
hand
ellen
tried
to
smile
in
answer
but
she
was
glad
to
hide
her
face
in
her
mother
bosom
and
the
long
close
embrace
was
too
close
and
too
long
it
told
of
sorrow
as
well
as
love
and
tears
fell
from
the
eyes
of
each
that
the
other
did
not
see
need
i
go
to
school
mamma
whispered
ellen
no
i
spoke
to
your
father
about
that
you
shall
not
go
any
more
we
will
be
together
now
while
we
can
ellen
wanted
to
ask
how
long
that
would
be
but
could
not
make
up
her
mind
to
it
sit
down
daughter
and
take
some
breakfast
have
you
done
mamma
no
i
waited
for
you
thank
you
dear
mamma
with
another
embrace
how
good
you
are
but
i
do
think
i
want
any
they
drew
their
chairs
to
the
table
but
it
was
plain
neither
had
much
heart
to
eat
although
montgomery
with
her
own
hand
laid
on
plate
half
of
the
little
bird
that
had
been
boiled
for
her
own
breakfast
the
half
was
too
much
for
each
of
them
what
made
you
so
late
this
morning
daughter
i
got
up
late
in
the
first
place
mamma
and
then
i
was
a
long
time
at
the
window
at
the
window
were
you
examining
into
your
neighbours
affairs
as
usual
said
montgomery
surprised
that
it
should
have
been
oh
no
mamma
i
did
look
at
them
at
all
except
poor
little
billy
i
was
looking
at
the
sky
and
what
did
you
see
there
that
pleased
you
so
much
i
do
know
mamma
it
looked
so
lovely
and
peaceful
that
pure
blue
spread
over
my
head
and
the
little
white
clouds
flying
across
it
i
loved
to
look
at
it
it
seemed
to
do
me
good
could
you
look
at
it
ellen
without
thinking
of
him
who
made
it
no
mamma
said
ellen
ceasing
her
breakfast
and
now
speaking
with
difficulty
i
did
think
of
him
perhaps
that
was
the
reason
and
what
did
you
think
of
him
daughter
i
hoped
mamma
i
felt
i
thought
he
would
take
care
of
me
said
ellen
bursting
into
tears
and
throwing
her
arms
round
her
mother
he
will
my
dear
daughter
he
will
if
you
will
only
put
your
trust
in
him
ellen
ellen
struggled
hard
to
get
back
her
composure
and
after
a
few
minutes
succeeded
mamma
will
you
tell
me
what
you
mean
exactly
by
my
my
in
him
do
you
trust
me
ellen
certainly
mamma
how
do
you
trust
me
in
what
why
mamma
in
the
first
place
i
trust
every
word
you
say
entirely
i
know
nothing
could
be
truer
if
you
were
to
tell
me
black
is
white
mamma
i
should
think
my
eyes
had
been
mistaken
then
everything
you
tell
or
advise
me
to
do
i
know
it
is
right
perfectly
and
i
always
feel
safe
when
you
are
near
me
because
i
know
you
take
care
of
me
and
i
am
glad
to
think
i
belong
to
you
and
you
have
the
management
of
me
entirely
and
i
need
manage
myself
because
i
know
i
ca
and
if
i
could
i
rather
you
would
mamma
my
daughter
it
is
just
so
it
is
so
that
i
wish
you
to
trust
in
god
he
is
truer
wiser
stronger
kinder
by
far
than
i
am
even
if
i
could
always
be
with
you
and
what
will
you
do
when
i
am
away
from
you
and
what
would
you
do
my
child
if
i
were
to
be
parted
from
you
for
ever
oh
mamma
said
ellen
bursting
into
tears
and
clasping
her
arms
round
her
mother
again
oh
dear
mamma
do
talk
about
it
her
mother
fondly
returned
her
caress
and
one
or
two
tears
fell
on
ellen
head
as
she
did
so
but
that
was
all
and
she
said
no
more
feeling
severely
the
effects
of
the
excitement
and
anxiety
of
the
preceding
day
and
night
she
now
stretched
herself
on
the
sofa
and
lay
quite
still
ellen
placed
herself
on
a
little
bench
at
her
side
with
her
back
to
the
head
of
the
sofa
that
her
mother
might
not
see
her
face
and
possessing
herself
of
one
of
her
hands
sat
with
her
little
head
resting
upon
her
mother
as
quiet
as
she
they
remained
thus
for
two
or
three
hours
without
speaking
and
montgomery
was
part
of
the
time
slumbering
but
now
and
then
a
tear
ran
down
the
side
of
the
sofa
and
dropped
on
the
carpet
where
ellen
sat
and
now
and
then
her
lips
were
softly
pressed
to
the
hand
she
held
as
if
they
would
grow
there
the
doctor
entrance
at
last
disturbed
them
doctor
green
found
his
patient
decidedly
worse
than
he
had
reason
to
expect
and
his
sagacious
eye
had
not
passed
back
and
forth
many
times
between
the
mother
and
daughter
before
he
saw
how
it
was
he
made
no
remark
upon
it
however
but
continued
for
some
moments
a
pleasant
chatty
conversation
which
he
had
begun
with
montgomery
he
then
called
ellen
to
him
he
had
rather
taken
a
fancy
to
her
well
miss
ellen
he
said
rubbing
one
of
her
hands
in
his
what
do
you
think
of
this
fine
scheme
of
mine
what
scheme
sir
why
this
scheme
of
sending
this
sick
lady
over
the
water
to
get
well
what
do
you
think
of
it
eh
it
make
her
quite
well
do
you
think
sir
asked
ellen
earnestly
it
make
her
well
to
be
sure
it
will
do
you
think
i
do
know
better
than
to
send
people
all
the
way
across
the
ocean
for
nothing
who
do
you
think
would
want
green
if
he
sent
people
on
wildgoose
chases
in
that
fashion
will
she
have
to
stay
long
there
before
she
is
cured
sir
asked
ellen
oh
that
i
ca
tell
that
depends
entirely
on
circumstances
perhaps
longer
perhaps
shorter
but
now
miss
ellen
i
got
a
word
of
business
to
say
to
you
you
know
you
agreed
to
be
my
little
nurse
nurse
this
lady
whom
i
put
under
your
care
the
other
day
is
quite
as
well
as
she
ought
to
be
this
morning
i
am
afraid
you
have
taken
proper
care
of
her
she
looks
to
me
as
if
she
had
been
too
much
excited
i
a
notion
she
has
been
secretly
taking
half
a
bottle
of
wine
or
reading
some
furious
kind
of
a
novel
or
something
of
that
sort
you
understand
now
mind
nurse
said
the
doctor
changing
his
tone
she
be
excited
you
must
take
care
that
she
is
not
it
good
for
her
you
must
let
her
talk
much
or
laugh
much
or
cry
at
all
on
any
account
she
must
be
worried
in
the
least
will
you
remember
now
you
know
what
i
shall
expect
of
you
you
must
be
very
careful
if
that
piece
of
toast
of
yours
should
chance
to
get
burned
one
of
these
fine
evenings
i
wo
answer
for
the
consequences
said
he
shaking
ellen
hand
you
need
look
sober
about
it
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
let
your
mamma
be
as
much
like
an
oyster
as
possible
you
understand
and
green
took
his
leave
poor
woman
said
the
doctor
to
himself
as
he
went
down
stairs
he
was
a
humane
man
i
wonder
if
she
live
till
she
gets
to
the
other
side
that
a
nice
little
girl
too
poor
child
poor
child
both
mother
and
daughter
silently
acknowledged
the
justice
of
the
doctor
advice
and
determined
to
follow
it
by
common
consent
as
it
seemed
each
for
several
days
avoided
bringing
the
subject
of
sorrow
to
the
other
mind
though
no
doubt
it
was
constantly
present
to
both
it
was
not
spoken
of
indeed
little
of
any
kind
was
spoken
of
but
that
never
montgomery
was
doubtless
employed
during
this
interval
in
preparing
for
what
she
believed
was
before
her
endeavouring
to
resign
herself
and
her
child
to
him
in
whose
hands
they
were
and
struggling
to
withdraw
her
affections
from
a
world
which
she
had
a
secret
misgiving
she
was
fast
leaving
as
for
ellen
the
doctor
warning
had
served
to
strengthen
the
resolve
she
had
already
made
that
she
would
not
distress
her
mother
with
the
sight
of
her
sorrow
and
she
kept
it
as
far
as
she
could
she
let
her
mother
see
but
very
few
tears
and
those
were
quiet
ones
though
she
drooped
her
head
like
a
withered
flower
and
went
about
the
house
with
an
air
of
submissive
sadness
that
tried
her
mother
sorely
but
when
she
was
alone
and
knew
no
one
could
see
sorrow
had
its
way
and
then
there
were
sometimes
agonies
of
grief
that
would
almost
have
broken
montgomery
resolution
had
she
known
them
this
however
could
not
last
ellen
was
a
child
and
of
most
buoyant
and
elastic
spirit
naturally
it
was
not
for
one
sorrow
however
great
to
utterly
crush
her
it
would
have
taken
years
to
do
that
moreover
she
entertained
not
the
slightest
hope
of
being
able
by
any
means
to
alter
her
father
will
she
regarded
the
dreaded
evil
as
an
inevitable
thing
but
though
she
was
at
first
overwhelmed
with
sorrow
and
for
some
days
evidently
pined
under
it
sadly
hope
at
length
come
back
to
her
little
heart
and
no
sooner
in
again
hope
began
to
smooth
the
roughest
and
soften
the
hardest
and
touch
the
dark
spots
with
light
in
ellen
future
the
thoughts
which
had
passed
through
her
head
that
first
morning
as
she
had
stood
at
her
window
now
came
back
again
thoughts
of
wonderful
improvement
to
be
made
during
her
absence
of
efforts
to
learn
and
amend
which
should
all
be
crowned
with
success
and
above
all
thoughts
of
that
coming
home
when
all
these
attainments
and
accomplishments
should
be
displayed
to
the
mother
delighted
eyes
and
her
exertions
receive
their
reward
they
made
ellen
heart
beat
and
her
eyes
swim
and
even
brought
a
smile
once
more
upon
her
lips
montgomery
was
rejoiced
to
see
the
change
she
felt
that
as
much
time
had
already
been
given
to
sorrow
as
they
could
afford
to
lose
and
she
had
not
known
exactly
how
to
proceed
ellen
amended
looks
and
spirits
greatly
relieved
her
what
are
you
thinking
about
ellen
said
she
one
morning
ellen
was
sewing
and
while
busy
at
her
work
her
mother
had
two
or
three
times
observed
a
light
smile
pass
over
her
face
ellen
looked
up
still
smiling
and
answered
oh
mamma
i
was
thinking
of
different
things
things
that
i
mean
to
do
while
you
are
gone
and
what
are
these
things
inquired
her
mother
oh
mamma
it
would
do
to
tell
you
beforehand
i
want
to
surprise
you
with
them
when
you
come
back
a
slight
shudder
passed
over
montgomery
frame
but
ellen
did
not
see
it
montgomery
was
silent
ellen
presently
introduced
another
subject
mamma
what
kind
of
a
person
is
my
aunt
i
do
not
know
i
have
never
seen
her
how
has
that
happened
mamma
your
aunt
has
always
lived
in
a
remote
country
town
and
i
have
been
very
much
confined
to
two
or
three
cities
and
your
father
long
and
repeated
absences
made
travelling
impossible
to
me
ellen
thought
but
she
did
not
say
it
that
it
was
very
odd
her
father
should
not
sometimes
when
he
in
the
country
have
gone
to
see
his
relations
and
taken
her
mother
with
him
what
is
my
aunt
name
mamma
i
think
you
must
have
heard
that
already
ellen
fortune
emerson
emerson
i
thought
she
was
papa
sister
so
she
is
then
how
comes
her
name
not
to
be
montgomery
she
is
only
his
the
daughter
of
his
mother
not
the
daughter
of
his
father
i
am
very
sorry
for
that
said
ellen
gravely
why
my
daughter
i
am
afraid
she
will
not
be
so
likely
to
love
me
you
must
think
so
my
child
her
loving
or
not
loving
you
will
depend
solely
and
entirely
upon
yourself
ellen
do
forget
that
if
you
are
a
good
child
and
make
it
your
daily
care
to
do
your
duty
she
can
not
help
liking
you
be
she
what
she
may
and
on
the
other
hand
if
she
have
all
the
will
in
the
world
to
love
you
she
can
not
do
it
unless
you
will
let
her
it
all
depends
on
your
behaviour
oh
mamma
i
ca
help
wishing
dear
aunt
bessy
was
alive
and
i
was
going
to
her
many
a
time
the
same
wish
had
passed
through
montgomery
mind
but
she
kept
down
her
rising
heart
and
went
on
calmly
you
must
not
expect
my
child
to
find
anybody
as
indulgent
as
i
am
or
as
ready
to
overlook
and
excuse
your
faults
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
look
for
it
and
you
must
not
think
hardly
of
your
aunt
when
you
find
she
is
not
your
mother
but
then
it
will
be
your
own
fault
if
she
does
not
love
you
in
time
truly
and
tenderly
see
that
you
render
her
all
the
respect
and
obedience
you
could
render
me
that
is
your
bounden
duty
she
will
stand
in
my
place
while
she
has
the
care
of
you
remember
that
ellen
and
remember
too
that
she
will
deserve
more
gratitude
at
your
hands
for
showing
you
kindness
than
i
do
because
she
can
not
have
the
same
feeling
of
love
to
make
trouble
easy
oh
no
mamma
said
ellen
i
do
think
so
it
that
very
feeling
of
love
that
i
am
grateful
for
i
do
care
a
fig
for
anything
people
do
for
me
without
that
but
you
can
make
her
love
you
ellen
if
you
try
well
i
try
mamma
and
do
be
discouraged
perhaps
you
may
be
disappointed
in
first
appearances
but
never
mind
that
have
patience
and
let
your
motto
be
if
there
any
occasion
overcome
evil
with
good
will
you
put
that
among
the
things
you
mean
to
do
while
i
am
gone
said
montgomery
with
a
smile
i
try
dear
mamma
you
will
succeed
if
you
try
dear
never
fear
if
you
apply
yourself
in
your
trying
to
the
only
unfailing
source
of
wisdom
and
strength
to
him
without
whom
you
can
do
nothing
there
was
silence
for
a
little
what
sort
of
a
place
is
it
where
my
aunt
lives
asked
ellen
your
father
says
it
is
a
very
pleasant
place
he
says
the
country
is
beautiful
and
very
healthy
and
full
of
charming
walks
and
rides
you
have
never
lived
in
the
country
i
think
you
will
enjoy
it
very
much
then
it
is
not
in
a
town
said
ellen
no
it
is
not
a
great
way
from
the
town
of
thirlwall
but
your
aunt
lives
in
the
open
country
your
father
says
she
is
a
capital
housekeeper
and
that
you
will
learn
more
and
be
in
all
respects
a
great
deal
happier
and
better
off
than
you
would
be
in
a
here
or
anywhere
ellen
heart
secretly
questioned
the
truth
of
this
last
assertion
very
much
is
there
any
school
near
she
asked
your
father
says
there
was
an
excellent
one
in
thirlwall
when
he
was
there
mamma
said
ellen
i
think
the
greatest
pleasure
i
shall
have
while
you
are
gone
will
be
writing
to
you
i
have
been
thinking
of
it
a
good
deal
i
mean
to
tell
you
everything
absolutely
everything
mamma
you
know
there
will
be
nobody
for
me
to
talk
to
as
i
do
to
you
words
came
out
with
difficulty
and
when
i
feel
badly
i
shall
just
shut
myself
up
and
write
to
you
she
hid
her
face
in
her
mother
lap
i
count
upon
it
my
dear
daughter
it
will
make
quite
as
much
the
pleasure
of
my
life
ellen
as
of
yours
but
then
mother
said
ellen
brushing
away
the
tears
from
her
eyes
it
will
be
so
long
before
my
letters
can
get
to
you
the
things
i
want
you
to
know
right
away
you
wo
know
perhaps
in
a
month
that
no
matter
daughter
they
will
be
just
as
good
when
they
do
get
to
me
never
think
of
that
write
every
day
and
all
manner
of
things
that
concern
you
just
as
particularly
as
if
you
were
speaking
to
me
and
you
write
to
me
too
mamma
indeed
i
will
when
i
can
but
ellen
you
say
that
when
i
am
away
and
can
not
hear
you
there
will
be
nobody
to
supply
my
place
perhaps
it
will
be
so
indeed
but
then
my
daughter
let
it
make
you
seek
that
friend
who
is
never
far
away
nor
out
of
hearing
draw
nigh
to
god
and
he
will
draw
nigh
to
you
you
know
he
has
said
of
his
children
they
call
i
will
answer
and
while
they
are
yet
speaking
i
will
hear
but
mamma
said
ellen
her
eyes
filling
instantly
you
know
he
is
not
my
friend
in
the
same
way
that
he
is
yours
and
hiding
her
face
again
she
added
oh
i
wish
he
was
you
know
the
way
to
make
him
so
ellen
is
willing
it
only
rests
with
you
oh
my
child
my
child
if
losing
your
mother
might
be
the
means
of
finding
you
that
better
friend
i
should
be
quite
willing
and
glad
to
go
for
ever
there
was
silence
only
broken
by
ellen
sobs
montgomery
voice
had
trembled
and
her
face
was
now
covered
with
her
hands
but
she
was
not
weeping
she
was
seeking
a
better
relief
where
it
had
long
been
her
habit
to
seek
and
find
it
both
resumed
their
usual
composure
and
the
employments
which
had
been
broken
off
but
neither
chose
to
renew
the
conversation
dinner
sleeping
and
company
prevented
their
having
another
opportunity
during
the
rest
of
the
day
but
when
evening
came
they
were
again
left
to
themselves
captain
montgomery
was
away
which
indeed
was
the
case
most
of
the
time
friends
had
taken
their
departure
the
curtains
were
down
the
lamp
lit
the
little
room
looked
cosy
and
comfortable
the
servant
had
brought
the
and
withdrawn
and
the
mother
and
daughter
were
happily
alone
montgomery
knew
that
such
occasions
were
numbered
and
fast
drawing
to
an
end
and
she
felt
each
one
to
be
very
precious
she
now
lay
on
her
couch
with
her
face
partially
shaded
and
her
eyes
fixed
upon
her
little
daughter
who
was
now
preparing
the
tea
she
watched
her
with
thoughts
and
feelings
not
to
be
spoken
as
the
little
figure
went
back
and
forward
between
the
table
and
the
fire
and
the
light
shining
full
upon
her
busy
face
showed
that
ellen
whole
soul
was
in
her
beloved
duty
tears
would
fall
as
she
looked
and
were
not
wiped
away
but
when
ellen
having
finished
her
work
brought
with
a
satisfied
face
the
little
tray
of
tea
and
toast
to
her
mother
there
was
no
longer
any
sign
of
them
left
montgomery
arose
with
her
usual
kind
smile
to
show
her
gratitude
by
honouring
as
far
as
possible
what
ellen
had
provided
you
have
more
appetite
mamma
i
am
very
glad
daughter
replied
her
mother
to
see
that
you
have
made
up
your
mind
to
bear
patiently
this
evil
that
has
come
upon
us
i
am
glad
for
your
sake
and
i
am
glad
for
mine
and
i
am
glad
too
because
we
have
a
great
deal
to
do
and
no
time
to
lose
in
doing
it
what
have
we
so
much
to
do
mamma
said
ellen
oh
many
things
said
her
mother
you
will
see
but
now
ellen
if
there
is
anything
you
wish
to
talk
to
me
about
any
question
you
want
to
ask
anything
you
would
like
particularly
to
have
or
to
have
done
for
you
i
want
you
to
tell
it
me
as
soon
as
possible
now
while
we
can
attend
to
it
for
perhaps
we
shall
be
hurried
mamma
said
ellen
with
brightening
eyes
there
is
one
thing
i
have
thought
of
that
i
should
like
to
have
shall
i
tell
it
you
now
yes
mamma
you
know
i
shall
want
to
be
writing
a
great
deal
would
it
be
a
good
thing
for
me
to
have
a
little
box
with
some
pens
in
it
and
an
inkstand
and
some
paper
and
wafers
because
mamma
you
know
i
shall
be
among
strangers
at
first
and
i
sha
feel
like
asking
them
for
these
things
as
often
as
i
shall
want
them
and
maybe
they
would
want
to
let
me
have
them
if
i
did
i
have
thought
of
that
already
daughter
said
montgomery
with
a
smile
and
a
sigh
i
will
certainly
take
care
that
you
are
well
provided
in
that
respect
before
you
go
how
am
i
to
go
mamma
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
who
will
go
with
me
you
know
i
ca
go
alone
mamma
no
my
daughter
i
not
send
you
alone
but
your
father
says
it
is
impossible
for
to
take
that
journey
at
present
and
it
is
yet
more
impossible
for
me
there
is
no
help
for
it
daughter
but
we
must
entrust
you
to
the
care
of
some
friend
going
that
way
but
he
that
holds
the
winds
and
waters
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
can
take
care
of
you
without
any
of
our
help
and
it
is
to
his
keeping
above
all
that
i
shall
commit
you
ellen
made
no
remark
and
seemed
much
less
surprised
and
troubled
than
her
mother
had
expected
in
truth
the
greater
evil
swallowed
up
the
less
parting
from
her
mother
and
for
so
long
a
time
it
seemed
to
her
comparatively
a
matter
of
little
importance
with
whom
she
went
or
how
or
where
except
for
this
the
taking
a
long
journey
under
a
care
would
have
been
a
dreadful
thing
to
her
do
you
know
yet
who
it
will
be
that
i
shall
go
with
mamma
not
yet
but
it
will
be
necessary
to
take
the
first
good
opportunity
for
i
can
not
go
till
i
have
seen
you
off
and
it
is
thought
very
desirable
that
i
should
get
to
sea
before
the
severe
weather
comes
it
was
with
a
pang
that
these
words
were
spoken
and
heard
but
neither
showed
it
to
the
other
it
has
comforted
me
greatly
my
dear
child
that
you
have
shown
yourself
so
submissive
and
patient
under
this
affliction
i
should
scarcely
have
been
able
to
endure
it
if
you
had
not
exerted
you
have
behaved
beautifully
this
was
almost
too
much
for
poor
ellen
it
required
her
utmost
stretch
of
to
keep
within
any
bounds
of
composure
and
for
some
moments
her
flushed
cheek
quivering
lip
and
heaving
bosom
told
what
a
tumult
her
mother
last
words
had
raised
montgomery
saw
she
had
gone
too
far
and
willing
to
give
both
ellen
and
herself
time
to
recover
she
laid
her
head
on
the
pillow
again
and
closed
her
eyes
many
thoughts
coming
thick
upon
one
another
presently
filled
her
mind
and
had
passed
before
she
again
recollected
what
she
had
meant
to
say
she
opened
her
eyes
ellen
was
sitting
at
a
little
distance
staring
into
the
fire
evidently
as
deep
in
meditation
as
her
mother
had
been
ellen
said
montgomery
did
you
ever
fancy
what
kind
of
a
bible
you
would
like
to
have
a
bible
mamma
said
ellen
with
sparkling
eyes
do
you
mean
to
give
me
a
bible
montgomery
smiled
but
mamma
said
ellen
gently
i
thought
you
could
afford
it
i
have
said
so
and
truly
answered
her
mother
and
hitherto
you
have
been
able
to
use
mine
but
i
will
not
leave
you
now
without
one
i
will
find
ways
and
means
said
montgomery
smiling
again
oh
mamma
thank
you
said
ellen
delighted
how
glad
i
shall
be
and
after
a
pause
of
consideration
she
added
mamma
i
never
thought
much
about
what
sort
of
a
one
i
should
like
could
i
tell
better
if
i
were
to
see
the
different
kinds
in
the
store
perhaps
so
well
the
first
day
that
the
weather
is
fine
enough
and
i
am
well
enough
i
will
go
out
with
you
and
we
will
see
about
it
i
am
afraid
green
wo
let
you
mamma
i
shall
not
ask
him
i
want
to
get
you
a
bible
and
some
other
things
that
i
will
not
leave
you
without
and
nobody
can
do
it
but
myself
i
shall
go
if
i
possibly
can
what
other
things
mamma
asked
ellen
very
much
interested
in
the
subject
i
do
think
it
will
do
to
tell
you
said
montgomery
smiling
i
foresee
that
you
and
i
should
be
kept
awake
quite
too
late
if
we
were
to
enter
upon
it
just
now
we
will
leave
it
till
now
read
to
me
love
and
then
to
bed
ellen
obeyed
and
went
to
sleep
with
brighter
visions
dancing
before
her
eyes
than
had
been
the
case
for
some
time
chapter
iii
sweetheart
we
shall
be
rich
ere
we
depart
if
fairings
come
thus
plentifully
in
shakespeare
ellen
had
to
wait
some
time
for
the
desired
fine
day
the
equinoctial
storms
would
have
their
way
as
usual
and
ellen
thought
they
were
longer
than
ever
this
year
but
after
many
stormy
days
had
tried
her
patience
there
was
at
length
a
sudden
change
both
without
and
within
doors
the
clouds
had
done
their
work
for
that
time
and
fled
away
before
a
strong
northerly
wind
leaving
the
sky
bright
and
fair
and
deceitful
disease
took
a
turn
and
for
a
little
space
raised
the
hopes
of
her
friends
all
were
rejoicing
but
two
persons
montgomery
was
not
deceived
neither
was
the
doctor
the
shopping
project
was
kept
a
profound
secret
from
him
and
from
everybody
except
ellen
ellen
watched
now
for
a
favourable
day
every
morning
as
soon
as
she
rose
she
went
to
the
window
to
see
what
was
the
look
of
the
weather
and
about
a
week
after
the
change
above
noticed
she
was
greatly
pleased
one
morning
on
opening
her
window
as
usual
to
find
the
air
and
sky
promising
all
that
could
be
desired
it
was
one
of
those
beautiful
days
in
the
end
of
september
that
sometimes
herald
october
before
it
arrives
cloudless
brilliant
and
breathing
balm
this
will
do
said
ellen
to
herself
in
great
satisfaction
i
think
this
will
do
i
hope
mamma
will
think
so
hastily
dressing
herself
and
a
good
deal
excited
already
she
ran
downstairs
and
after
the
morning
salutations
examined
her
looks
with
as
much
anxiety
as
she
had
just
done
those
of
the
weather
all
was
satisfactory
there
also
and
ellen
ate
her
breakfast
with
an
excellent
appetite
but
she
said
not
a
word
of
the
intended
expedition
till
her
father
should
be
gone
she
contented
herself
with
strengthening
her
hopes
by
making
constant
fresh
inspections
of
the
weather
and
her
mother
countenance
alternately
and
her
eyes
returning
from
the
window
on
one
of
these
excursions
and
meeting
her
mother
face
saw
a
smile
there
which
said
all
she
wanted
breakfast
went
on
more
vigorously
than
ever
but
after
breakfast
it
seemed
to
ellen
that
her
father
never
would
go
away
he
took
the
newspaper
an
uncommon
thing
for
him
and
pored
over
it
most
perseveringly
while
ellen
was
in
a
perfect
fidget
of
impatience
her
mother
seeing
the
state
she
was
in
and
taking
pity
on
her
sent
her
upstairs
to
do
some
little
matters
of
business
in
her
own
room
these
ellen
despatched
with
all
possible
zeal
and
speed
and
coming
down
again
found
her
father
gone
and
her
mother
alone
she
flew
to
kiss
her
in
the
first
place
and
then
made
the
inquiry
do
you
think
will
do
mamma
as
fine
as
possible
daughter
we
could
not
have
a
better
but
i
must
wait
till
the
doctor
has
been
here
mamma
said
ellen
after
a
pause
making
a
great
effort
of
i
am
afraid
you
ought
to
go
out
to
get
these
things
for
me
pray
do
mamma
if
you
think
it
will
do
you
harm
i
would
rather
go
without
them
indeed
i
would
never
mind
that
daughter
said
montgomery
kissing
her
i
am
bent
upon
it
it
would
be
quite
as
much
of
a
disappointment
to
me
as
to
you
not
to
go
we
have
a
lovely
day
for
it
and
we
will
take
our
time
and
walk
slowly
and
we
have
far
to
go
either
but
i
must
let
green
make
his
visit
first
to
fill
up
the
time
till
he
came
montgomery
employed
ellen
in
reading
to
her
as
usual
and
this
morning
reading
ellen
long
after
remembered
her
mother
directed
her
to
several
passages
in
different
parts
of
the
bible
that
speak
of
heaven
and
its
enjoyments
and
though
when
she
began
her
own
little
heart
was
full
of
excitement
in
view
of
the
day
plans
and
beating
with
hope
and
pleasure
the
sublime
beauty
of
the
words
and
thoughts
as
she
went
on
awed
her
into
quiet
and
her
mother
manner
at
length
turned
her
attention
entirely
from
herself
montgomery
was
lying
on
the
sofa
and
for
the
most
part
listened
in
silence
with
her
eyes
closed
but
sometimes
saying
a
word
or
two
that
made
ellen
feel
how
deep
was
the
interest
her
mother
had
in
the
things
she
read
of
and
how
pure
and
strong
the
pleasure
she
was
even
now
taking
in
them
and
sometimes
there
was
a
smile
on
her
face
that
ellen
scarce
liked
to
see
it
gave
her
an
indistinct
feeling
that
her
mother
would
not
be
long
away
from
that
heaven
to
which
she
seemed
already
to
belong
ellen
had
a
sad
consciousness
too
that
she
had
no
part
with
her
mother
in
this
matter
she
could
hardly
go
on
she
came
to
that
beautiful
passage
in
the
seventh
of
revelation
and
one
of
the
elders
answered
saying
unto
me
what
are
these
which
are
arrayed
in
white
robes
and
whence
came
they
and
i
said
unto
him
sir
thou
knowest
and
he
said
unto
me
these
are
they
which
came
out
of
great
tribulation
and
have
washed
their
robes
and
made
them
white
in
the
blood
of
the
lamb
therefore
are
they
before
the
throne
of
god
and
serve
him
day
and
night
in
his
temple
and
he
that
sitteth
on
the
throne
shall
dwell
among
them
they
shall
hunger
no
more
neither
thirst
any
more
neither
shall
the
sun
light
on
them
nor
any
heat
for
the
lamb
which
is
in
the
midst
of
the
throne
shall
feed
them
and
shall
lead
them
unto
living
fountains
of
waters
and
god
shall
wipe
away
all
tears
from
their
eyes
with
difficulty
and
a
husky
voice
ellen
got
through
it
lifting
then
her
eyes
to
her
mother
face
she
saw
again
the
same
singularly
sweet
smile
ellen
felt
that
she
could
not
read
another
word
to
her
great
relief
the
door
opened
and
green
came
in
his
appearance
changed
the
whole
course
of
her
thoughts
all
that
was
grave
or
painful
fled
quickly
away
ellen
head
was
immediately
full
again
of
what
had
filled
it
before
she
began
to
read
as
soon
as
the
doctor
had
retired
and
was
fairly
out
of
hearing
now
mamma
shall
we
go
said
ellen
you
need
stir
mamma
i
bring
all
your
things
to
you
and
put
them
on
may
i
mamma
then
you
wo
be
a
bit
tired
before
you
set
out
her
mother
assented
and
with
a
great
deal
of
tenderness
and
a
great
deal
of
eagerness
ellen
put
on
her
stockings
and
shoes
arranged
her
hair
and
did
all
that
she
could
toward
changing
her
dress
and
putting
on
her
bonnet
and
shawl
and
greatly
delighted
she
was
when
the
business
was
accomplished
now
mamma
you
look
like
yourself
i
have
seen
you
look
so
well
this
great
while
i
so
glad
you
going
out
again
said
ellen
putting
her
arms
round
her
i
do
believe
it
will
do
you
good
now
mamma
i
go
and
get
ready
i
be
very
quick
about
it
you
have
to
wait
long
for
me
in
a
few
minutes
the
two
set
forth
from
the
house
the
day
was
as
fine
as
could
be
there
was
no
wind
there
was
no
dust
the
sun
was
not
oppressive
and
montgomery
did
feel
refreshed
and
strengthened
during
the
few
steps
they
had
to
take
to
their
first
it
was
a
jeweller
store
ellen
had
never
been
in
one
before
in
her
life
and
her
first
feeling
on
entering
was
of
dazzled
wonderment
at
the
glittering
splendours
around
this
was
presently
forgotten
in
curiosity
to
know
what
her
mother
could
possibly
want
there
she
soon
discovered
that
she
had
come
to
sell
and
not
to
buy
montgomery
drew
a
ring
from
her
finger
and
after
a
little
chaffering
parted
with
it
to
the
owner
of
the
store
for
eighty
dollars
being
about
of
its
real
value
the
money
was
counted
out
and
she
left
the
store
mamma
said
ellen
in
a
low
voice
was
that
grandmamma
ring
which
i
thought
you
loved
so
much
yes
i
did
love
it
ellen
but
i
love
you
better
oh
mamma
i
am
very
sorry
said
ellen
you
need
not
be
sorry
daughter
jewels
in
themselves
are
the
merest
nothings
to
me
and
as
for
the
rest
it
does
matter
i
can
remember
my
mother
without
any
help
from
a
trinket
there
were
tears
however
in
montgomery
eyes
that
showed
the
sacrifice
had
cost
her
something
and
there
were
tears
in
ellen
that
told
it
was
not
thrown
away
upon
her
i
am
sorry
you
should
know
of
this
continued
montgomery
you
should
not
if
i
could
have
helped
it
but
set
your
heart
quite
at
rest
ellen
i
assure
you
this
use
of
my
ring
gives
me
more
pleasure
on
the
whole
than
any
other
i
could
have
made
of
it
a
grateful
squeeze
of
her
hand
and
glance
into
her
face
was
answer
montgomery
had
applied
to
her
husband
for
the
funds
necessary
to
fit
ellen
comfortably
for
the
time
they
should
be
absent
and
in
answer
he
had
given
her
a
sum
barely
sufficient
for
her
mere
clothing
montgomery
knew
him
better
than
to
ask
for
a
further
supply
but
she
resolved
to
have
recourse
to
other
means
to
do
what
she
had
determined
upon
now
that
she
was
about
to
leave
her
little
daughter
and
it
might
be
for
ever
she
had
set
her
heart
upon
providing
her
with
certain
things
which
she
thought
important
to
her
comfort
and
improvement
and
which
ellen
would
go
very
long
without
if
did
not
give
them
to
her
and
ellen
had
had
very
few
presents
in
her
life
and
those
always
of
the
simplest
and
cheapest
kind
her
mother
resolved
that
in
the
midst
of
the
bitterness
of
this
time
she
would
give
her
one
pleasure
if
she
could
it
might
be
the
last
they
stopped
next
at
a
oh
what
a
delicious
smell
of
new
books
said
ellen
as
they
entered
mamma
if
it
was
for
one
thing
i
should
say
i
never
was
so
happy
in
my
life
children
books
lying
in
tempting
confusion
near
the
door
immediately
fastened
ellen
eyes
and
attention
she
opened
one
and
was
already
deep
in
the
interest
of
it
when
the
word
struck
her
ear
montgomery
was
desiring
the
shopman
to
show
her
various
kinds
and
sizes
that
she
might
choose
from
among
them
down
went
ellen
book
and
she
flew
to
the
place
where
a
dozen
different
bibles
were
presently
displayed
ellen
wits
were
ready
to
forsake
her
such
beautiful
bibles
she
had
never
seen
she
pored
in
ecstasy
over
their
varieties
of
type
and
binding
and
was
very
evidently
in
love
with
them
all
now
ellen
said
montgomery
look
and
choose
take
your
time
and
see
which
you
like
best
it
was
not
likely
that
ellen
time
would
be
a
short
one
her
mother
seeing
this
took
a
chair
at
a
little
distance
to
await
patiently
her
decision
and
while
ellen
eyes
were
riveted
on
the
bibles
her
own
very
naturally
were
fixed
upon
her
in
the
excitement
and
eagerness
of
the
moment
ellen
had
thrown
off
her
light
bonnet
and
with
flushed
cheek
and
sparkling
eye
and
a
brow
grave
with
unusual
care
as
though
a
nation
fate
were
deciding
she
was
weighing
the
comparative
advantages
of
large
small
and
middle
sized
black
blue
purple
and
red
gilt
and
not
gilt
clasp
and
no
clasp
everything
but
the
bibles
before
her
ellen
had
forgotten
utterly
she
was
deep
in
what
was
to
her
the
most
important
of
business
she
did
not
see
the
bystanders
smile
she
did
not
know
there
were
any
to
her
mother
eye
it
was
a
most
fair
sight
montgomery
gazed
with
rising
emotions
of
pleasure
and
pain
that
struggled
for
the
mastery
but
pain
at
last
got
the
better
and
rose
very
high
how
can
i
give
thee
up
was
the
one
thought
of
her
heart
unable
to
command
herself
she
rose
and
went
to
a
distant
part
of
the
counter
where
she
seemed
to
be
examining
books
but
tears
some
of
the
bitterest
she
had
ever
shed
were
falling
thick
upon
the
dusty
floor
and
she
felt
her
heart
like
to
break
her
little
daughter
at
one
end
of
the
counter
had
forgotten
there
ever
was
such
a
thing
as
sorrow
in
the
world
and
she
at
the
other
was
bowed
beneath
a
weight
of
it
that
was
nigh
to
crush
her
but
in
her
extremity
she
betook
herself
to
that
refuge
she
had
never
known
to
fail
it
did
not
fail
her
now
she
remembered
the
words
ellen
had
been
reading
to
her
that
very
morning
and
they
came
like
the
breath
of
heaven
upon
the
fever
of
her
soul
not
my
will
but
thine
be
done
she
strove
and
prayed
to
say
it
and
not
in
vain
and
after
a
little
while
she
was
able
to
return
to
her
seat
she
felt
that
she
had
been
shaken
by
a
tempest
but
she
was
calmer
now
than
before
ellen
was
just
as
she
had
left
her
and
apparently
just
as
far
from
coming
to
any
conclusion
montgomery
was
resolved
to
let
her
take
her
way
presently
ellen
came
over
from
the
counter
with
a
large
royal
octavo
bible
heavy
enough
to
be
a
good
lift
for
her
mamma
said
she
laying
it
on
her
mother
lap
and
opening
it
what
do
you
think
of
that
is
that
splendid
a
most
beautiful
page
indeed
is
this
your
choice
ellen
well
mamma
i
do
know
what
do
you
think
i
think
it
is
rather
inconveniently
large
and
heavy
for
everyday
use
it
is
quite
a
weight
upon
my
lap
i
should
like
to
carry
it
in
my
hands
long
you
would
want
a
little
table
on
purpose
to
hold
it
well
that
would
do
at
all
said
ellen
laughing
i
believe
you
are
right
mamma
i
wonder
i
did
think
of
it
i
might
have
known
that
myself
she
took
it
back
and
there
followed
another
careful
examination
of
the
whole
stock
and
then
ellen
came
to
her
mother
with
a
beautiful
miniature
edition
in
two
volumes
gilt
and
clasped
and
very
perfect
in
all
respects
but
of
exceedingly
small
print
i
think
i
have
this
mamma
said
she
is
it
a
beauty
i
could
put
it
in
my
pocket
you
know
and
carry
it
anywhere
with
the
greatest
ease
it
would
have
one
great
objection
to
me
said
montgomery
inasmuch
as
i
can
not
possibly
see
to
read
it
can
not
you
mamma
but
i
can
read
it
perfectly
well
my
dear
take
it
that
is
if
you
will
make
up
your
mind
to
put
on
spectacles
before
your
time
spectacles
mamma
i
hope
i
shall
never
have
to
wear
spectacles
what
do
you
propose
to
do
when
your
sight
fails
if
you
shall
live
so
long
well
mamma
if
it
comes
to
that
but
you
do
advise
me
then
to
take
this
little
beauty
judge
for
yourself
i
think
you
are
old
enough
i
know
what
you
think
though
mamma
and
i
dare
say
you
are
right
too
i
wo
take
it
though
it
a
pity
well
i
must
look
again
montgomery
came
to
her
help
for
it
was
plain
ellen
had
lost
the
power
of
judging
amidst
so
many
tempting
objects
but
she
presently
simplified
the
matter
by
putting
aside
all
that
were
decidedly
too
large
or
too
small
or
too
fine
print
there
remained
three
of
moderate
size
and
sufficiently
large
type
but
different
binding
either
of
these
i
think
will
answer
your
purpose
nicely
said
montgomery
then
mamma
if
you
please
i
will
have
the
red
one
i
like
that
best
because
it
will
put
me
in
mind
of
yours
montgomery
could
find
no
fault
with
this
reason
she
paid
for
the
red
bible
and
directed
it
to
be
sent
home
sha
i
carry
it
mamma
said
ellen
no
you
would
find
it
in
the
way
we
have
several
things
to
do
yet
have
we
mamma
i
thought
we
only
came
to
get
a
bible
that
is
enough
for
one
day
i
confess
i
am
a
little
afraid
your
head
will
be
turned
but
i
must
run
the
risk
of
it
i
dare
not
lose
the
opportunity
of
this
fine
weather
i
may
not
have
such
another
i
wish
to
have
the
comfort
of
thinking
when
i
am
away
that
i
have
left
you
with
everything
necessary
to
the
keeping
up
of
good
habits
everything
that
will
make
them
pleasant
and
easy
i
wish
you
to
be
always
neat
and
tidy
and
industrious
depending
upon
others
as
little
as
possible
and
careful
to
improve
yourself
by
every
means
and
especially
by
writing
to
me
i
will
leave
you
no
excuse
ellen
for
failing
in
any
of
these
duties
i
trust
you
will
not
disappoint
me
in
a
single
particular
ellen
heart
was
too
full
to
speak
she
again
looked
up
tearfully
and
pressed
her
mother
hand
i
do
not
expect
to
be
disappointed
love
returned
montgomery
they
now
entered
a
large
fancy
store
what
are
we
to
get
here
mamma
said
ellen
a
box
to
put
your
pens
and
paper
in
said
her
mother
smiling
oh
to
be
sure
said
ellen
i
had
almost
forgotten
that
she
quite
forgot
it
a
minute
after
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
seen
the
inside
of
such
a
store
and
the
articles
displayed
on
every
side
completely
bewitched
her
from
one
thing
to
another
she
went
admiring
and
wondering
in
her
wildest
dreams
she
had
never
imagined
such
beautiful
things
the
store
was
fairyland
montgomery
meanwhile
attended
to
business
having
chosen
a
neat
little
japanned
perfectly
plain
but
well
supplied
with
everything
a
child
could
want
in
that
line
she
called
ellen
from
the
delightful
journey
of
discovery
she
was
making
round
the
store
and
asked
her
what
she
thought
of
it
i
think
it
a
little
beauty
said
ellen
but
i
never
saw
such
a
place
for
beautiful
things
you
think
it
will
do
then
said
her
mother
for
me
mamma
you
do
mean
to
give
it
to
me
oh
mother
how
good
you
are
but
i
know
what
is
the
best
way
to
thank
you
and
i
do
it
what
a
perfect
little
beauty
mamma
i
too
happy
i
hope
not
said
her
mother
for
you
know
i
have
got
you
the
box
for
your
pens
and
paper
yet
well
mamma
i
try
and
bear
it
said
ellen
laughing
but
do
get
me
the
plainest
little
thing
in
the
world
for
you
giving
me
too
much
montgomery
asked
to
look
at
and
was
shown
to
another
part
of
the
store
for
the
purpose
mamma
said
ellen
in
a
low
tone
as
they
went
you
not
going
to
get
me
a
why
that
is
the
best
kind
of
box
for
holding
writing
materials
said
her
mother
smiling
do
you
think
so
i
do
know
what
to
say
exclaimed
ellen
i
ca
thank
you
mamma
i
have
any
words
to
do
it
i
think
i
shall
go
crazy
she
was
truly
overcome
with
the
weight
of
happiness
words
failed
her
and
tears
came
instead
from
among
a
great
many
desks
of
all
descriptions
montgomery
with
some
difficulty
succeeded
in
choosing
one
to
her
mind
it
was
of
mahogany
not
very
large
but
thoroughly
well
made
and
finished
and
very
convenient
and
perfect
in
its
internal
arrangements
ellen
was
speechless
occasional
looks
at
her
mother
and
deep
sighs
were
all
she
had
now
to
offer
the
desk
was
quite
empty
ellen
said
her
mother
do
you
remember
the
furniture
of
miss
allen
desk
that
you
were
so
pleased
with
a
while
ago
perfectly
mamma
i
know
all
that
was
in
it
well
then
you
must
prompt
me
if
i
forget
anything
your
desk
will
be
furnished
with
everything
really
useful
merely
showy
matters
we
can
dispense
with
now
let
us
see
here
is
a
great
empty
place
that
i
think
wants
some
paper
to
fill
it
show
me
some
of
different
sizes
if
you
please
the
shopman
obeyed
and
montgomery
stocked
the
desk
well
with
letter
paper
large
and
small
ellen
looked
on
in
great
satisfaction
that
will
do
nicely
she
said
that
large
paper
will
be
beautiful
whenever
i
am
writing
to
you
mamma
you
know
and
the
other
will
do
for
other
times
when
i
have
so
much
to
say
though
i
am
sure
i
know
who
there
is
in
the
world
i
should
ever
send
letters
to
except
you
if
there
is
nobody
now
perhaps
there
will
be
at
some
future
time
replied
her
mother
i
hope
i
shall
not
always
be
your
only
correspondent
now
what
next
envelopes
mamma
to
be
sure
i
had
forgotten
them
envelopes
of
both
sizes
to
match
because
mamma
you
know
i
might
and
i
certainly
shall
want
to
write
upon
the
fourth
page
of
my
letter
and
i
could
do
it
unless
i
had
envelopes
a
sufficient
stock
of
envelopes
was
laid
in
mamma
said
ellen
what
do
you
think
of
a
little
who
are
the
notes
to
be
written
to
ellen
said
montgomery
smiling
you
need
smile
mamma
you
know
as
you
said
if
i
do
now
know
perhaps
i
shall
miss
allen
desk
had
that
made
me
think
of
it
so
shall
yours
daughter
while
we
are
about
it
we
will
do
the
thing
well
and
your
will
keep
quite
safely
in
this
nice
little
place
provided
for
it
even
if
you
should
not
want
to
use
a
sheet
of
it
in
years
how
nice
that
is
said
ellen
admiringly
i
suppose
the
must
have
envelopes
too
said
montgomery
to
be
sure
mamma
i
suppose
so
said
ellen
smiling
miss
had
well
now
we
have
got
all
the
paper
we
want
i
think
said
montgomery
the
next
thing
is
ink
or
an
inkstand
rather
different
kinds
were
presented
for
her
choice
oh
mamma
that
one
wo
do
said
ellen
anxiously
you
know
the
desk
will
be
knocking
about
in
a
trunk
and
the
ink
would
run
out
and
spoil
everything
it
should
be
one
of
those
that
shut
tight
i
do
see
the
right
kind
here
the
shopman
brought
one
there
mamma
do
you
see
said
ellen
it
shuts
with
a
spring
and
nothing
can
possibly
come
out
do
you
see
mamma
you
can
turn
it
i
see
you
are
quite
right
daughter
it
seems
i
should
get
on
very
ill
without
you
to
advise
me
fill
the
inkstand
if
you
please
mamma
what
shall
i
do
when
my
ink
is
gone
that
inkstand
will
hold
but
a
little
you
know
your
aunt
will
supply
you
of
course
my
dear
when
you
are
out
i
rather
take
some
of
my
own
by
half
said
ellen
you
could
not
carry
a
bottle
of
ink
in
your
desk
without
great
danger
to
everything
else
in
it
it
would
not
do
to
venture
we
have
excellent
said
the
shopman
in
small
packages
which
can
be
very
conveniently
carried
about
you
see
there
is
a
compartment
in
the
desk
for
such
things
and
the
ink
is
very
easily
made
at
any
time
oh
that
will
do
nicely
said
ellen
that
is
just
the
thing
now
what
is
to
go
in
this
other
square
place
opposite
the
inkstand
said
montgomery
that
is
the
place
for
the
box
of
lights
mamma
what
sort
of
lights
for
sealing
letters
mamma
you
know
they
are
not
like
your
wax
taper
at
all
they
are
little
wax
matches
that
burn
just
long
enough
to
seal
one
or
two
letters
miss
allen
showed
me
how
she
used
them
hers
were
in
a
nice
little
box
just
like
the
inkstand
on
the
outside
and
there
was
a
place
to
light
the
matches
and
a
place
to
set
them
in
while
they
are
burning
there
mamma
that
it
said
ellen
as
the
shopman
brought
forth
the
article
which
she
was
describing
that
it
exactly
and
that
will
just
fit
now
mamma
for
the
wax
you
want
to
seal
your
letter
before
you
have
written
it
said
montgomery
we
have
not
got
the
pens
yet
that
true
mamma
let
us
have
the
pens
and
some
quills
too
mamma
do
you
know
how
to
make
a
pen
ellen
no
mamma
not
yet
but
i
want
to
learn
very
much
miss
pichegru
says
that
every
lady
ought
to
know
how
to
make
her
own
pens
miss
pichegru
is
very
right
but
i
think
you
are
rather
too
young
to
learn
however
we
will
try
now
here
are
steel
points
enough
to
last
you
a
great
while
and
as
many
quills
as
it
is
needful
you
should
cut
up
for
one
year
at
least
we
have
a
pen
handle
yet
here
mamma
said
ellen
holding
out
a
plain
ivory
one
do
you
like
this
i
think
that
it
is
prettier
than
these
that
are
all
cut
and
fussed
or
those
other
gay
ones
either
i
think
so
too
ellen
the
plainer
the
prettier
now
what
comes
next
the
knife
mamma
to
make
the
pens
said
ellen
smiling
true
the
knife
let
us
see
some
of
your
best
now
ellen
choose
that
one
wo
do
my
dear
it
should
have
two
blades
a
large
as
well
as
a
small
one
you
know
you
want
to
mend
a
pencil
sometimes
so
i
do
mamma
to
be
sure
you
very
right
here
a
nice
one
now
mamma
the
wax
there
is
a
box
full
choose
your
own
colours
seeing
it
was
likely
to
be
a
work
of
time
montgomery
walked
away
to
another
part
of
the
store
when
she
returned
ellen
had
made
up
an
assortment
of
the
oddest
colours
she
could
find
i
wo
have
any
red
mamma
it
is
so
common
she
said
i
think
it
is
the
prettiest
of
all
said
montgomery
do
you
mamma
then
i
will
have
a
stick
of
red
on
purpose
to
seal
to
you
with
and
who
do
you
intend
shall
have
the
benefit
of
the
other
colours
inquired
her
mother
i
declare
mamma
said
ellen
laughing
i
never
thought
of
that
i
am
afraid
they
will
have
to
go
to
you
you
must
not
mind
mamma
if
you
get
green
and
blue
and
yellow
seals
once
in
a
while
i
dare
say
i
shall
submit
myself
to
it
with
a
good
grace
said
montgomery
but
come
my
dear
have
we
got
all
we
want
this
desk
has
been
very
long
in
furnishing
you
have
given
me
a
seal
yet
mamma
seals
there
are
a
variety
before
you
see
if
you
can
find
one
that
you
like
by
the
way
you
can
not
seal
a
letter
can
you
not
yet
mamma
said
ellen
smiling
again
that
is
another
of
the
things
i
have
got
to
learn
then
i
think
you
had
better
have
some
wafers
in
the
meantime
while
ellen
was
picking
out
her
seal
which
took
not
a
little
time
montgomery
laid
in
a
good
supply
of
wafers
of
all
sorts
and
then
went
on
further
to
furnish
the
desk
with
an
ivory
a
a
a
ruler
and
a
neat
little
silver
pencil
also
some
indiarubber
and
sheets
of
drawing
paper
she
took
a
sad
pleasure
in
adding
everything
she
could
think
of
that
might
be
for
ellen
future
use
or
advantage
but
as
with
her
own
hands
she
placed
in
the
desk
one
thing
after
another
the
thought
crossed
her
mind
how
ellen
would
make
drawings
with
those
very
pencils
on
those
very
sheets
of
paper
which
her
eyes
would
never
see
she
turned
away
with
a
sigh
and
receiving
ellen
seal
from
her
hand
put
that
also
in
its
place
ellen
had
chosen
one
with
her
own
name
will
you
send
these
things
said
montgomery
i
particularly
wish
to
have
them
at
home
as
early
in
the
day
as
possible
the
man
promised
montgomery
paid
the
bill
and
she
and
ellen
left
the
store
they
walked
a
little
way
in
silence
i
can
not
thank
you
mamma
said
ellen
it
is
not
necessary
my
dear
child
said
montgomery
returning
the
pressure
of
her
hand
i
know
all
that
you
would
say
there
was
as
much
sorrow
as
joy
at
that
moment
in
the
heart
of
the
joy
fullest
of
the
two
where
are
we
going
now
mamma
said
ellen
again
after
a
while
i
wished
and
intended
to
have
gone
to
clair
fleury
to
get
you
some
merino
and
other
things
but
we
have
been
detained
so
long
already
that
i
think
i
had
better
go
home
i
feel
somewhat
tired
i
am
very
sorry
dear
mamma
said
ellen
i
am
afraid
i
kept
you
too
long
about
that
desk
you
did
not
keep
me
daughter
any
longer
than
i
chose
to
be
kept
but
i
think
i
will
go
home
now
and
take
the
chance
of
another
fine
day
for
the
merino
chapter
iv
how
can
i
live
without
thee
how
forego
thy
sweet
converse
and
love
so
dearly
joined
milton
when
dinner
was
over
and
the
table
cleared
away
the
mother
and
daughter
were
left
as
they
always
loved
to
be
alone
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
and
already
somewhat
dark
for
clouds
had
gathered
over
the
beautiful
sky
of
the
morning
and
the
wind
rising
now
and
then
made
its
voice
heard
montgomery
was
lying
on
the
sofa
as
usual
seemingly
at
ease
and
ellen
was
sitting
on
a
little
bench
before
the
fire
very
much
at
ease
indeed
without
any
seeming
about
it
she
smiled
as
she
met
her
mother
eyes
you
have
made
me
very
happy
mamma
i
am
glad
of
it
my
dear
child
i
hoped
i
should
i
believe
the
whole
affair
has
given
me
as
much
pleasure
ellen
as
it
has
you
there
was
a
pause
mamma
i
will
take
the
greatest
possible
care
of
my
new
treasures
i
know
you
will
if
i
had
doubted
it
ellen
most
assuredly
i
should
not
have
given
them
to
you
sorry
as
i
should
have
been
to
leave
you
without
them
so
you
see
you
have
not
established
a
character
for
carefulness
in
vain
and
mamma
i
hope
you
have
not
given
them
to
me
in
vain
either
i
will
try
to
use
them
in
the
way
that
i
know
you
wish
me
to
that
will
be
the
best
way
i
can
thank
you
well
i
have
left
you
no
excuse
ellen
you
know
fully
what
i
wish
you
to
do
and
to
be
and
when
i
am
away
i
shall
please
myself
with
thinking
that
my
little
daughter
following
her
mother
wishes
i
shall
believe
so
ellen
you
will
not
let
me
be
disappointed
oh
no
mamma
said
ellen
who
was
now
in
her
mother
arms
well
my
child
said
montgomery
in
a
lighter
tone
my
gifts
will
serve
as
reminders
for
you
if
you
are
ever
tempted
to
forget
my
lessons
if
you
fail
to
send
me
letters
or
if
those
you
send
are
not
what
they
ought
to
be
i
think
the
desk
will
cry
shame
upon
you
and
if
you
ever
go
an
hour
with
a
hole
in
your
stocking
or
a
tear
in
your
dress
or
a
string
off
your
petticoat
i
hope
the
sight
of
your
will
make
you
blush
mamma
yes
oh
i
forgot
you
not
seen
that
no
mamma
what
do
you
mean
why
my
dear
that
was
one
of
the
things
you
most
wanted
but
i
thought
it
best
not
to
overwhelm
you
quite
this
morning
so
while
you
were
on
an
exploring
expedition
round
the
store
i
chose
and
furnished
one
for
you
oh
mamma
mamma
said
ellen
getting
up
and
clasping
her
hands
what
shall
i
do
i
do
know
what
to
say
i
ca
say
anything
mamma
too
much
so
it
seemed
for
ellen
sat
down
and
began
to
cry
her
mother
silently
reached
out
a
hand
to
her
which
she
squeezed
and
kissed
with
all
the
energy
of
gratitude
love
and
sorrow
till
gently
drawn
by
the
same
hand
she
was
placed
again
in
her
mother
arms
and
upon
her
bosom
and
in
that
tried
she
lay
calmed
and
quieted
till
the
shades
of
afternoon
deepened
into
evening
and
evening
into
night
and
the
light
of
the
fire
was
all
that
was
left
to
them
though
not
a
word
had
been
spoken
for
a
long
time
ellen
was
not
asleep
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
red
glow
of
the
coals
in
the
grate
and
she
was
busily
thinking
but
not
of
them
many
sober
thoughts
were
passing
through
her
little
head
and
stirring
her
heart
a
few
were
of
her
new
possessions
and
bright
projects
more
of
her
mother
she
was
thinking
how
very
very
precious
was
the
heart
she
could
feel
beating
where
her
cheek
lay
she
thought
it
was
greater
happiness
to
lie
there
than
anything
else
in
life
could
be
she
thought
she
had
rather
even
die
so
on
her
mother
breast
than
live
long
without
her
in
the
world
she
felt
that
in
earth
or
in
heaven
there
was
nothing
so
dear
suddenly
she
broke
the
silence
mamma
what
does
that
mean
that
loveth
father
or
mother
more
than
me
is
not
worthy
of
me
it
means
just
what
it
says
if
you
love
anybody
or
anything
better
than
jesus
christ
you
can
not
be
one
of
his
children
but
then
mamma
said
ellen
raising
her
head
how
i
be
one
of
his
children
i
do
love
you
a
great
deal
better
how
can
i
help
it
mamma
you
can
not
help
it
i
know
my
dear
said
montgomery
with
a
sigh
except
by
his
grace
who
has
promised
to
change
the
hearts
of
his
people
to
take
away
the
heart
of
stone
and
give
them
a
heart
of
flesh
but
is
mine
a
heart
of
stone
then
mamma
because
i
can
not
help
loving
you
best
not
to
me
dear
ellen
replied
montgomery
pressing
closer
the
little
form
that
lay
in
her
arms
i
have
never
found
it
so
but
yet
i
know
that
the
lord
jesus
is
far
far
more
worthy
of
your
affection
than
i
am
and
if
your
heart
were
not
hardened
by
sin
you
would
see
him
so
it
is
only
because
you
do
not
know
him
that
you
love
me
better
pray
pray
my
dear
child
that
he
would
take
away
the
power
of
sin
and
show
you
himself
that
is
all
that
is
wanting
i
will
mamma
said
ellen
tearfully
oh
mamma
what
shall
i
do
without
you
alas
montgomery
heart
echoed
the
question
she
had
no
answer
mamma
said
ellen
after
a
few
minutes
can
i
have
no
true
love
to
him
at
all
unless
i
love
him
i
dare
not
say
that
you
can
answered
her
mother
seriously
mamma
said
ellen
after
a
little
again
raising
her
head
and
looking
her
mother
full
in
the
face
as
if
willing
to
apply
the
severest
test
to
this
hard
doctrine
and
speaking
with
an
indescribable
expression
do
love
him
than
you
do
she
knew
her
mother
loved
the
saviour
but
she
thought
it
scarcely
possible
that
herself
could
have
but
the
second
place
in
her
heart
she
ventured
a
bold
question
to
prove
whether
her
mother
practice
would
not
contradict
her
theory
but
montgomery
answered
steadily
i
do
my
daughter
and
with
a
gush
of
tears
ellen
sunk
her
head
again
upon
her
bosom
she
had
no
more
to
say
her
mouth
was
stopped
for
ever
as
to
the
of
the
matter
though
she
still
thought
it
an
impossible
duty
in
her
own
particular
case
i
do
indeed
my
daughter
repeated
montgomery
that
does
not
make
my
love
to
you
the
less
but
the
more
ellen
oh
mamma
mamma
said
ellen
clinging
to
her
i
wish
you
would
teach
me
i
have
only
you
and
i
am
going
to
lose
you
what
shall
i
do
mamma
with
a
voice
that
strove
to
be
calm
montgomery
answered
love
them
that
love
me
and
they
that
seek
me
early
shall
find
me
and
after
a
minute
or
two
she
added
he
who
says
this
has
promised
too
that
he
will
the
lambs
with
his
arm
and
carry
them
in
his
bosom
the
words
fell
soothingly
on
ellen
ear
and
the
slight
tremor
in
the
voice
reminded
her
also
that
her
mother
must
not
be
agitated
she
checked
herself
instantly
and
soon
lay
as
before
quiet
and
still
on
her
mother
bosom
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
fire
and
montgomery
did
not
know
that
when
she
now
and
then
pressed
a
kiss
upon
the
forehead
that
lay
so
near
her
lips
it
every
time
brought
the
water
to
eyes
and
a
throb
to
her
heart
but
after
some
half
or
of
an
hour
had
passed
away
a
sudden
knock
at
the
door
found
both
mother
and
daughter
asleep
it
had
to
be
repeated
once
or
twice
before
the
knocker
could
gain
attention
what
is
that
mamma
said
ellen
starting
up
somebody
at
the
door
open
it
quickly
love
ellen
did
so
and
found
a
man
standing
there
with
his
arms
rather
full
of
sundry
packages
oh
mamma
my
things
cried
ellen
clapping
her
hands
here
they
are
the
man
placed
his
burden
on
the
table
and
withdrew
oh
mamma
i
am
so
glad
they
are
come
now
if
i
only
had
a
light
this
is
my
desk
i
know
for
it
the
largest
and
i
think
this
is
my
as
well
as
i
can
tell
by
feeling
yes
it
is
here
the
handle
on
top
and
this
is
my
dear
not
so
big
as
the
desk
nor
so
little
as
the
oh
mamma
may
i
ring
for
a
light
there
was
no
need
for
a
servant
just
then
entered
bringing
the
candles
and
the
ellen
was
capering
about
in
the
most
fantastic
style
but
suddenly
stopped
short
at
sight
of
the
and
looked
very
grave
well
mamma
i
tell
you
what
i
do
she
said
after
a
pause
of
consideration
i
make
the
tea
the
first
thing
before
i
untie
a
single
knot
wo
that
be
best
mamma
because
i
know
if
i
once
begin
to
look
i
sha
want
to
stop
do
you
think
that
is
wise
mamma
but
alas
the
fire
had
got
very
low
there
was
no
making
the
tea
quickly
and
the
toast
was
a
work
of
time
and
when
all
was
over
at
length
it
was
then
too
late
for
ellen
to
begin
to
undo
packages
she
struggled
with
impatience
a
minute
or
two
and
then
gave
up
the
point
very
gracefully
and
went
to
bed
she
had
a
fine
opportunity
the
next
day
to
make
up
for
the
disappointment
it
was
cloudy
and
stormy
going
out
was
not
to
be
thought
of
and
it
was
very
unlikely
that
anybody
would
come
in
ellen
joyfully
allotted
the
whole
morning
to
the
examination
and
trial
of
her
new
possessions
and
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
and
the
room
clear
she
set
about
it
she
first
went
through
the
desk
and
everything
in
it
making
a
running
commentary
on
the
excellence
fitness
and
beauty
of
all
it
contained
then
the
received
a
share
but
a
much
smaller
share
of
attention
and
lastly
with
fingers
trembling
with
eagerness
she
untied
the
packthread
that
was
wound
round
the
and
slowly
took
off
cover
after
cover
she
almost
screamed
when
the
last
was
removed
the
box
was
of
beautifully
finished
and
lined
with
crimson
silk
and
montgomery
had
taken
good
care
it
should
want
nothing
that
ellen
might
need
to
keep
her
clothes
in
perfect
order
oh
mamma
how
beautiful
oh
mamma
how
good
you
are
mamma
i
promise
you
i
never
be
a
slattern
here
is
more
cotton
than
i
can
use
up
in
a
great
while
every
number
i
do
think
and
needles
oh
the
needles
what
a
parcel
of
them
and
mamma
what
a
lovely
scissors
did
you
choose
it
mamma
or
did
it
belong
to
the
box
i
chose
it
i
might
have
guessed
it
mamma
it
just
like
you
and
here
a
thimble
fits
me
exactly
and
an
how
pretty
and
a
bodkin
this
is
a
great
deal
nicer
than
yours
mamma
yours
is
decidedly
the
worse
for
wear
and
what
this
oh
to
make
eyelet
holes
with
i
know
and
oh
mamma
here
is
almost
everything
i
think
here
are
tapes
and
buttons
and
hooks
and
eyes
and
darning
cotton
and
and
pins
and
all
sorts
of
things
what
this
for
mamma
that
a
scissors
to
cut
with
try
it
on
that
piece
of
paper
that
lies
by
you
and
you
will
see
how
it
works
oh
i
see
said
ellen
how
very
nice
that
is
well
i
shall
take
great
pains
now
to
make
my
very
handsomely
one
survey
of
her
riches
could
by
no
means
satisfy
ellen
for
some
time
she
pleased
herself
with
going
over
and
over
the
contents
of
the
box
finding
each
time
something
new
to
like
at
length
she
closed
it
and
keeping
it
still
in
her
lap
sat
awhile
looking
thoughtfully
into
the
fire
till
turning
towards
her
mother
she
met
her
gaze
fixed
mournfully
almost
tearfully
on
herself
the
box
was
instantly
shoved
aside
and
getting
up
and
bursting
into
tears
ellen
went
to
her
oh
dear
mother
she
said
i
wish
they
were
all
back
in
the
store
if
i
could
only
keep
you
montgomery
answered
only
by
folding
her
to
her
heart
is
there
no
help
for
it
mamma
there
is
none
we
know
that
all
things
shall
work
together
for
good
to
them
that
love
god
then
it
will
all
be
good
for
you
mamma
but
what
will
it
be
for
me
and
ellen
sobbed
bitterly
it
will
be
all
well
my
precious
child
i
doubt
not
i
do
not
doubt
it
ellen
do
not
doubt
it
either
love
but
from
the
hand
that
wounds
seek
the
healing
he
wounds
that
he
heal
he
does
not
afflict
willingly
perhaps
he
sees
ellen
that
you
never
would
seek
him
while
you
had
me
to
cling
to
ellen
clung
to
her
at
that
moment
yet
not
more
than
her
mother
clung
to
her
how
happy
we
were
mamma
only
a
year
ago
even
a
month
we
have
no
continuing
city
here
answered
her
mother
with
a
sigh
but
there
is
a
home
ellen
where
changes
do
not
come
and
they
that
are
once
gathered
there
are
parted
no
more
for
ever
and
all
tears
are
wiped
from
their
eyes
i
believe
i
am
going
fast
to
that
home
and
now
my
greatest
concern
is
that
my
little
ellen
my
precious
baby
may
follow
me
and
come
there
too
no
more
was
said
nor
could
be
said
till
the
sound
of
the
steps
upon
the
stair
obliged
each
of
them
to
assume
an
appearance
of
composure
as
speedily
as
possible
but
they
could
not
succeed
perfectly
enough
to
blind
him
he
did
not
seem
very
well
satisfied
and
told
ellen
he
believed
he
should
have
to
get
another
nurse
he
was
afraid
she
did
obey
orders
while
the
doctor
was
there
ellen
bible
was
brought
in
and
no
sooner
was
he
gone
than
it
underwent
as
thorough
an
examination
as
the
boxes
had
received
ellen
went
over
every
part
of
it
with
the
same
great
care
and
satisfaction
but
mixed
with
a
different
feeling
the
words
that
caught
her
eye
as
she
turned
over
the
leaves
seemed
to
echo
what
her
mother
had
been
saying
to
her
it
began
to
grow
dear
already
after
a
little
she
rose
and
brought
it
to
the
sofa
are
you
satisfied
with
it
ellen
oh
yes
mamma
it
is
perfectly
beautiful
outside
and
inside
now
mamma
will
you
please
to
write
my
name
in
this
precious
book
my
name
and
anything
else
you
please
mother
i
bring
you
my
new
pen
to
write
it
with
and
i
got
ink
here
shall
i
she
brought
it
and
montgomery
wrote
ellen
name
and
the
date
of
the
gift
the
pen
played
a
moment
in
her
fingers
and
then
she
wrote
below
the
date
love
them
that
love
me
and
they
that
seek
me
early
shall
find
me
this
was
for
ellen
but
the
next
words
were
not
for
her
what
made
her
write
them
will
be
a
god
to
thee
and
to
thy
seed
after
thee
they
were
written
almost
unconsciously
and
as
if
bowed
by
an
unseen
force
montgomery
head
sank
upon
the
open
page
and
her
whole
soul
went
up
with
her
petition
let
these
words
be
my
memorial
that
i
have
trusted
in
thee
and
oh
when
these
miserable
lips
are
silent
for
ever
remember
the
word
unto
thy
servant
upon
which
thou
hast
caused
me
to
hope
and
be
unto
my
little
one
all
thou
hast
been
to
me
unto
thee
lift
i
up
mine
eyes
o
thou
that
dwellest
in
the
heavens
she
raised
her
face
from
the
book
closed
it
and
gave
it
silently
to
ellen
ellen
had
noticed
her
action
but
had
no
suspicion
of
the
cause
she
supposed
that
one
of
her
mother
frequent
feelings
of
weakness
or
sickness
had
made
her
lean
her
head
upon
the
bible
and
she
thought
no
more
about
it
however
ellen
felt
that
she
wanted
no
more
of
her
boxes
that
day
she
took
her
old
place
by
the
side
of
her
mother
sofa
with
her
head
upon
her
mother
hand
and
an
expression
of
quiet
sorrow
in
her
face
that
it
had
not
worn
for
several
days
chapter
v
my
child
is
yet
a
stranger
in
the
world
she
hath
not
seen
the
change
of
fourteen
years
shakespeare
the
next
day
would
not
do
for
the
intended
shopping
nor
the
next
the
third
day
was
fine
though
cool
and
windy
do
you
think
you
can
venture
out
mamma
said
ellen
i
am
afraid
not
i
do
not
feel
quite
equal
to
it
and
the
wind
is
a
great
deal
too
high
for
me
besides
well
said
ellen
in
a
tone
of
one
who
is
making
up
her
mind
to
something
we
shall
have
a
fine
day
i
suppose
if
we
wait
long
enough
we
had
to
wait
a
great
while
for
our
first
shopping
day
i
wish
such
another
would
come
round
but
the
misfortune
is
said
her
mother
that
we
can
not
afford
to
wait
november
will
soon
be
here
and
your
clothes
may
be
suddenly
wanted
before
they
are
ready
if
we
do
not
bestir
ourselves
and
miss
rice
is
coming
in
a
few
days
i
ought
to
have
the
merino
ready
for
her
what
will
you
do
mamma
i
do
not
know
indeed
ellen
i
am
greatly
at
a
loss
could
papa
get
the
stuffs
for
you
mamma
no
he
too
busy
and
besides
he
knows
nothing
at
all
about
shopping
for
me
he
would
be
sure
to
bring
me
exactly
what
i
do
not
want
i
tried
that
once
well
what
will
you
do
mamma
is
there
nobody
else
you
could
ask
to
get
the
things
for
you
foster
would
do
it
mamma
i
know
she
would
and
i
should
ask
her
without
any
difficulty
but
she
is
confined
to
her
room
with
a
cold
i
see
nothing
for
it
but
to
be
patient
and
let
things
take
their
course
though
if
a
favourable
opportunity
should
offer
you
would
have
to
go
clothes
or
no
clothes
it
would
not
do
to
lose
the
chance
of
a
good
escort
and
montgomery
face
showed
that
this
possibility
of
going
unprovided
gave
her
some
uneasiness
ellen
observed
it
never
mind
me
dearest
mother
do
be
in
the
least
worried
about
my
clothes
you
do
know
how
little
i
think
of
them
or
care
for
them
it
no
matter
at
all
whether
i
have
them
or
not
montgomery
smiled
and
passed
her
hand
fondly
over
her
little
daughter
head
but
presently
resumed
her
anxious
look
out
of
the
window
mamma
exclaimed
ellen
suddenly
starting
up
a
bright
thought
has
just
come
into
my
head
do
it
for
you
mamma
do
what
i
get
the
merino
and
things
for
you
mamma
you
need
smile
i
will
indeed
if
you
will
let
me
my
dear
ellen
said
her
mother
i
do
doubt
you
would
if
goodwill
only
were
wanting
but
a
great
deal
of
skill
and
experience

necessary
for

shopper

why

like
it
dearly
if

so

mamma

do
like
my
child
to
venture
you
alone
on
such
an
errand
among
crowds
of
people
i
should
be
uneasy
about
you
dear
mamma
what
would
the
crowds
of
people
do
to
me
i
am
not
a
bit
afraid
you
know
mamma
i
have
often
taken
walks
alone
that
nothing
new
and
what
harm
should
come
to
me
while
i
am
in
the
store
you
need
be
the
least
uneasy
about
me
may
i
go
montgomery
smiled
but
was
silent
may
i
go
mamma
repeated
ellen
let
me
go
at
least
and
try
what
i
can
do
what
do
you
say
mamma
i
do
know
what
to
say
my
daughter
but
i
am
in
difficulty
on
either
hand
i
will
let
you
go
and
see
what
you
can
do
it
would
be
a
great
relief
to
me
to
get
this
merino
by
any
means
then
shall
i
go
right
away
mamma
as
well
now
as
ever
are
not
afraid
of
the
wind
i
should
think
not
said
ellen
and
away
she
scampered
upstairs
to
get
ready
with
eager
haste
she
dressed
herself
then
with
great
care
and
particularity
took
her
mother
instructions
as
to
the
article
wanted
and
finally
set
out
sensible
that
a
great
trust
was
reposed
in
her
and
feeling
busy
and
important
accordingly
but
at
the
very
bottom
of
ellen
heart
there
was
a
little
secret
doubtfulness
respecting
her
undertaking
she
hardly
knew
it
was
there
but
then
she
could
tell
what
it
was
that
made
her
fingers
so
inclined
to
be
tremulous
while
she
was
dressing
and
that
made
her
heart
beat
quicker
than
it
ought
or
than
was
pleasant
and
one
of
her
cheeks
so
much
hotter
than
the
other
however
she
set
forth
upon
her
errand
with
a
very
brisk
step
which
she
kept
up
till
on
turning
a
corner
she
came
in
sight
of
the
place
she
was
going
to
without
thinking
much
about
it
ellen
had
directed
her
steps
to
clair
fleury
it
was
one
of
the
largest
and
best
stores
in
the
city
and
the
one
she
knew
where
her
mother
generally
made
her
purchases
and
it
did
not
occur
to
her
that
it
might
not
be
the
best
for
her
purpose
on
this
occasion
but
her
steps
slackened
as
soon
as
she
came
in
sight
of
it
and
continued
to
slacken
as
she
drew
nearer
and
she
went
up
the
broad
flight
of
marble
steps
in
front
of
the
store
very
slowly
indeed
though
they
were
exceedingly
low
and
easy
pleasure
was
not
certainly
the
uppermost
feeling
in
her
mind
now
yet
she
never
thought
of
turning
back
she
knew
that
if
she
could
succeed
in
the
object
of
her
mission
her
mother
would
be
relieved
from
some
anxiety
that
was
enough
she
was
bent
on
accomplishing
it
timidly
she
entered
the
large
hall
of
the
entrance
it
was
full
of
people
and
the
buzz
of
business
was
heard
on
all
sides
ellen
had
for
some
time
past
seldom
gone
a
shopping
with
her
mother
and
had
never
been
in
this
store
but
once
or
twice
before
she
had
not
the
remotest
idea
where
or
in
what
apartment
of
the
building
the
merino
counter
was
situated
and
she
could
see
no
one
to
speak
to
she
stood
irresolute
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
everybody
seemed
to
be
busily
engaged
with
somebody
else
and
whenever
an
opening
on
one
side
or
another
appeared
to
promise
her
an
opportunity
it
was
sure
to
be
filled
up
before
she
could
reach
it
and
disappointed
and
abashed
she
would
return
to
her
old
station
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
clerks
frequently
passed
her
crossing
the
store
in
all
directions
but
they
were
always
bustling
along
in
a
great
hurry
of
business
they
did
not
seem
to
notice
her
at
all
and
were
gone
before
poor
ellen
could
speak
to
them
she
knew
well
enough
now
poor
child
what
it
was
that
made
her
cheeks
burn
as
they
did
and
her
heart
beat
as
if
it
would
burst
its
bounds
she
felt
confused
and
almost
confounded
by
the
incessant
hum
of
voices
and
moving
crowd
of
strange
people
all
around
her
while
her
little
figure
stood
alone
and
unnoticed
in
the
midst
of
them
and
there
seemed
no
prospect
that
she
would
be
able
to
gain
the
ear
or
the
eye
of
a
single
person
once
she
determined
to
accost
a
man
she
saw
advancing
toward
her
from
a
distance
and
actually
made
up
to
him
for
the
purpose
but
with
a
hurried
bow
and
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
he
brushed
past
ellen
almost
burst
into
tears
she
longed
to
turn
and
run
out
of
the
store
but
a
faint
hope
remaining
and
an
unwillingness
to
give
up
her
undertaking
kept
her
fast
at
length
one
of
the
clerks
at
the
desk
observed
her
and
remarked
to
clair
who
stood
by
there
is
a
little
girl
sir
who
seems
to
be
looking
for
something
or
waiting
for
somebody
she
has
been
standing
there
a
good
while
clair
upon
this
advanced
to
poor
ellen
relief
what
do
you
wish
miss
he
said
but
ellen
had
been
so
long
preparing
sentences
trying
to
utter
them
and
failing
in
the
attempt
that
now
when
an
opportunity
to
speak
and
be
heard
was
given
her
the
power
of
speech
seemed
to
be
gone
do
you
wish
anything
miss
inquired
clair
again
mother
sent
me
stammered
ellen
i
wish
if
you
please
sir
mamma
wished
me
to
look
at
merinoes
sir
if
you
please
is
your
mamma
in
the
store
no
sir
said
ellen
she
is
ill
and
can
not
come
out
and
she
sent
me
to
look
at
merinoes
for
her
if
you
please
sir
here
saunders
said
clair
show
this
young
lady
the
merinoes
saunders
made
his
appearance
from
among
a
little
group
of
clerks
with
whom
he
had
been
indulging
in
a
few
jokes
by
way
of
relief
from
the
tedium
of
business
come
this
way
he
said
to
ellen
and
sauntering
before
her
with
a
rather
dissatisfied
air
led
the
way
out
of
the
entrance
hall
into
another
and
much
larger
apartment
there
were
plenty
of
people
here
too
and
just
as
busy
as
those
they
had
quitted
saunders
having
brought
ellen
to
the
merino
counter
placed
himself
behind
it
and
leaning
over
it
and
fixing
his
eyes
carelessly
upon
her
asked
what
she
wanted
to
look
at
his
tone
and
manner
struck
ellen
most
unpleasantly
and
made
her
again
wish
herself
out
of
the
store
he
was
a
tall
lank
young
man
with
a
quantity
of
fair
hair
combed
down
on
each
side
of
his
face
a
slovenly
exterior
and
the
most
disagreeable
pair
of
eyes
ellen
thought
she
had
ever
beheld
she
could
not
bear
to
meet
them
and
cast
down
her
own
their
look
was
bold
and
and
ellen
felt
though
she
could
have
told
why
that
she
need
not
expect
either
kindness
or
politeness
from
him
what
do
you
want
to
see
little
one
inquired
this
gentleman
as
if
he
had
a
business
on
hand
he
would
like
to
be
rid
of
ellen
heartily
wished
he
was
rid
of
it
and
she
too
merinoes
if
you
please
she
answered
without
looking
up
well
what
kind
of
merinoes
here
are
all
sorts
and
descriptions
of
merinoes
and
i
ca
pull
them
all
down

for

to
look
at
what
kind
do
you
want
i
do
know
without
looking
said
ellen
wo
you
please
to
show
me
some
he
tossed
down
several
pieces
upon
the
counter
and
tumbled
them
about
before
her
there
said
he
is
that
anything
like
what
you
want
there
a
pink
one
and
there
a
blue
one
and
there
a
green
one

the
kind

the
kind

ellen
but

colour

something
dark
if
you

that
green

pretty
for

ellen
mamma

and
choose
her
stuffs
herself

blue
or

nice
grey

said
ellen

she
pretty
easy
to
suit
a
dark
blue
i
showed
you
already
what
the
matter
with
that
it
is
dark
enough
said
ellen
well
said
he
discontentedly
pulling
down
another
piece
how
that
do
that
dark
enough
it
was
a
fine
and
beautiful
piece
very
different
from
those
he
had
showed
her
at
first
even
ellen
could
see
that
and
fumbling
for
her
little
pattern
of
merino
she
compared
it
with
the
piece
they
agreed
perfectly
as
to
fineness
what
is
the
price
of
this
she
asked
with
trembling
hope
that
she
was
going
to
be
rewarded
by
success
for
all
the
trouble
of
her
enterprise
two
dollars
a
yard
her
hopes
and
countenance
fell
together
that
too
high
she
said
with
a
sigh
then
take
this
other
blue
come
it
a
great
deal
prettier
than
that
dark
one
and
not
so
dear
and
i
know
your
mother
will
like
it
better
ellen
cheeks
were
tingling
and
her
heart
throbbing
but
she
bear
to
give
up
would
you
be
so
good
as
to
show
me
some
grey
he
slowly
and
complied
and
took
down
an
excellent
piece
of
dark
grey
which
ellen
fell
in
love
with
at
once
but
she
was
again
disappointed
it
was
fourteen
shillings
well
if
you
wo
take
that
take
something
else
said
the
man
you
ca
have
everything
at
once
if
you
will
have
cheap
goods
of
course
you
ca
have
the
same
quality
that
you
like
but
now
here
this
other
blue
only
twelve
shillings
and
i
let
you
have
it
for
ten
if
take
it
no
it
is
too
light
and
too
coarse
said
ellen
mamma
would
like
it
let
me
see
said
he
seizing
her
pattern
and
pretending
to
compare
it
it
quite
as
fine
as
this
if
that
all
you
want
could
you
said
ellen
timidly
give
me
a
little
bit
of
this
grey
to
show
mamma
oh
no
said
he
impatiently
tossing
over
the
cloths
and
throwing
ellen
pattern
on
the
floor
we
ca
cut
up
our
goods
if
people
do
choose
to
buy
of
us
they
may
go
somewhere
else
and
if
you
can
not
decide
upon
anything
i
must
go
and
attend
to
those
that
can
i
wait
here
all
day
what
the
matter
saunders
said
one
of
his
brother
clerks
passing
him
why
i
been
here
this
showing
cloths
to
a
child
that
does
know
merino
from
a
sheep
back
said
he
laughing
and
some
other
customers
coming
up
at
the
moment
he
was
as
good
as
his
word
and
left
ellen
to
attend
to
them
ellen
stood
a
moment
stock
still
just
where
he
had
left
her
struggling
with
her
feelings
of
mortification
she
could
not
endure
to
let
them
be
seen
her
face
was
on
fire
her
head
was
dizzy
she
could
not
stir
at
first
and
in
spite
of
her
utmost
efforts
she
not
command
back
one
or
two
rebel
tears
that
forced
their
way
she
lifted
her
hand
to
her
face
to
remove
them
as
quickly
as
possible
what
is
all
this
about
my
little
girl
said
a
strange
voice
at
her
side
ellen
started
and
turned
her
face
with
the
tears
but
half
wiped
away
toward
the
speaker
it
was
an
old
gentleman
an
odd
old
gentleman
too
she
thought
one
she
certainly
would
have
been
rather
shy
of
if
she
had
seen
him
under
other
circumstances
but
though
his
face
was
odd
it
looked
kindly
upon
her
and
it
was
a
kind
tone
of
voice
in
which
this
question
had
been
put
so
he
seemed
to
her
like
a
friend
what
is
all
this
repeated
the
old
gentleman
ellen
began
to
tell
what
it
was
but
the
pride
which
had
forbidden
her
to
weep
before
strangers
gave
way
at
one
touch
of
sympathy
and
she
poured
out
tears
much
faster
than
words
as
she
related
her
story
so
that
it
was
some
little
time
before
the
old
gentleman
could
get
a
clear
notion
of
her
case
he
waited
very
patiently
till
she
had
finished
but
then
he
set
himself
in
good
earnest
about
righting
the
wrong
hallo
you
sir
he
shouted
in
a
voice
that
made
everybody
look
round
you
merino
man
come
and
show
your
goods
why
are
you
at
your
post
sir
as
saunders
came
up
with
an
altered
countenance
here
a
young
lady
you
left
standing
unattended
to
i
do
know
how
long
are
these
your
manners
the
young
lady
did
not
wish
anything
i
believe
sir
returned
saunders
softly
you
know
better
you
scoundrel
retorted
the
old
gentleman
who
was
in
a
great
passion
i
saw
the
whole
matter
with
my
own
eyes
you
are
a
disgrace
to
the
store
sir
and
deserve
to
be
sent
out
of
it
which
you
are
like
enough
to
be
i
really
thought
sir
said
saunders
smoothly
for
he
knew
the
old
gentleman
and
knew
very
well
he
was
a
person
that
must
not
be
offended
i
really
thought
i
was
not
aware
sir
that
the
young
lady
had
any
occasion
for
my
services

show
your
wares
sir
and

found

the
old
gentleman

gentleman

saunders

the
crestfallen
saunders
the
young
lady
mistook
me
i
was
speaking
of

piece

said
two
dollars
he
said
this
was
two
dollars

the
grey

blue

overjoyed

the
floor

the
old
gentleman

and
delivered
it
after
stooping
in
search
of

till
he
was
very
red
in
the
face
and
he
was
left
wishing
heartily
that
he
had
some
safe
means
of
revenge
and
obliged
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
none
was
within
his
reach
and
that
he
must
stomach
his
dignity
in
the
best
manner
he
could
but
ellen
and
her
protector
went
forth
most
joyously
together
from
the
store
do
you
live
far
from
here
asked
the
old
gentleman
oh
no
sir
said
ellen
not
very
it
only
at
green
hotel
in
southing
street
i
go
with
you
said
he
and
when
your
mother
has
decided
which
merino
she
will
have
we
come
right
back
and
get
it
i
do
not
want
to
trust
you
again
to
the
mercy
of
that
saucy
clerk
oh
thank
you
sir
said
ellen
that
is
just
what
i
was
afraid
of
but
i
shall
be
giving
you
a
great
deal
of
trouble
sir
she
added
in
another
tone
no
you
wo
said
the
old
gentleman
i
ca
be
troubled
so
you
need
say
anything
about
that
they
went
gaily
along
ellen
heart
about
five
times
as
light
as
the
one
with
which
she
had
travelled
that
very
road
a
little
while
before
her
old
friend
was
in
a
very
cheerful
mood
too
for
he
assured
ellen
laughingly
that
it
was
of
no
manner
of
use
for
her
to
be
in
a
hurry
for
he
could
not
possibly
set
off
and
skip
to
green
hotel
as
she
seemed
inclined
to
do
they
got
there
at
last
ellen
showed
the
old
gentleman
into
the
parlour
and
ran
upstairs
in
great
haste
to
her
mother
but
in
a
few
minutes
she
came
down
again
with
a
very
april
face
for
smiles
were
playing
in
every
feature
while
the
tears
were
yet
wet
upon
her
cheeks
mamma
hopes
you
take
the
trouble
sir
to
come
upstairs
she
said
seizing
his
hand
she
wants
to
thank
you
yourself
sir
it
is
not
necessary
said
the
old
gentleman
it
is
not
necessary
at
all
but
he
followed
his
little
conductor
nevertheless
to
the
door
of
her
mother
room
into
which
she
ushered
him
with
great
satisfaction
montgomery
was
looking
very
ill
he
saw
that
at
a
glance
she
rose
from
her
sofa
and
extending
her
hand
thanked
him
with
glistening
eyes
for
his
kindness
to
her
child
i
do
deserve
any
thanks
said
the
old
gentleman
i
suppose
my
little
friend
has
told
you
what
made
us
acquainted
she
gave
me
a
very
short
account
of
it
said
montgomery
she
was
very
disagreeably
tried
said
the
old
gentleman
i
presume
you
do
not
need
to
be
told
that
her
behaviour
was
such
as
would
have
become
any
years
i
assure
you
if
i
had
no
kindness
in
my
composition
to
feel
for
the
my
honour
as
a
gentleman
would
have
made
me
interfere
for
the
montgomery
smiled
but
looked
through
glistening
eyes
again
on
ellen
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
she
replied
i
was
very
far
from
thinking
when
i
permitted
her
to
go
on
this
errand
that
i
was
exposing
her
to
anything
more
serious
than
the
annoyance
a
timid
child
would
feel
at
having
to
transact
business
with
strangers
i
suppose
not
said
the
old
gentleman
but
it
is
a
sort
of
thing
that
should
be
often
done
there
are
all
sorts
of
people
in
this
world
and
a
little
one
alone
in
a
crowd
is
in
danger
of
being
trampled
upon
montgomery
heart
answered
this
with
an
involuntary
pang
he
saw
the
shade
that
passed
over
her
face
as
she
said
sadly
i
know
it
sir
and
it
was
with
strong
unwillingness
that
i
allowed
ellen
this
morning
to
do
as
she
had
proposed
but
in
truth
i
was
making
a
choice
between
difficulties
i
am
very
sorry
i
chose
as
i
did
if
you
are
a
father
sir
you
know
better
than
i
can
tell
you
how
grateful
i
am
for
your
kind
interference
say
nothing
about
that
the
less
the
better
i
am
an
old
man
and
not
good
for
much
now
except
to
please
young
people
i
think
myself
best
off
when
i
have
the
best
chance
to
do
that
so
if
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
choose
that
merino
and
let
miss
ellen
and
me
go
and
despatch
our
business
you
will
be
conferring
and
not
receiving
a
favour
and
any
other
errand
that
you
please
to
entrust
her
with
i
undertake
to
see
her
safe
through
his
look
and
manner
obliged
montgomery
to
take
him
at
his
word
a
very
short
examination
of
ellen
patterns
ended
in
favour
of
the
grey
merino
and
ellen
was
commissioned
not
only
to
get
and
pay
for
this
but
also
to
choose
a
dark
dress
of
the
same
stuff
and
enough
of
a
certain
article
for
a
nankeen
coat
montgomery
truly
opining
that
the
old
gentleman
care
would
do
more
than
see
her
scathless
that
it
would
have
some
regard
to
the
justness
and
prudence
of
her
purchases
in
great
glee
ellen
set
forth
again
with
her
new
old
friend
her
hand
was
fast
in
his
and
her
tongue
ran
very
freely
for
her
heart
was
completely
opened
to
him
he
seemed
as
pleased
to
listen
as
she
was
to
talk
and
by
little
and
little
ellen
told
him
all
her
history
the
troubles
that
had
come
upon
her
in
consequence
of
her
mother
illness
and
her
intended
journey
and
prospects
that
was
a
happy
day
to
ellen
they
returned
to
clair
and
fleury
bought
the
grey
merino
and
the
nankeen
and
a
dark
brown
merino
for
a
dress
do
you
want
only
one
of
these
asked
the
old
gentleman
mamma
said
only
one
said
ellen
that
will
last
me
all
the
winter
well
said
he
i
think
two
will
be
better
let
us
have
another
off
the
same
piece
mr
shopman
but
i
am
afraid
mamma
wo
like
it
sir
said
ellen
gently
pho
pho
said
he
your
mother
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
this
is
my
affair
he
paid
for
it
accordingly
now
miss
ellen
said
he
when
they
left
the
store
have
you
got
anything
in
the
shape
of
a
good
warm
winter
bonnet
for
it
as
cold
as
the
mischief
up
there
in
thirlwall
your
pasteboard
things
wo
do
if
you
do
take
good
care
of
your
ears
you
will
lose
them
some
fine
frosty
day
you
must
quilt
and
pad
and
all
sorts
of
things
to
keep
alive
and
comfortable
so
you
have
a
hood
eh
do
you
think
you
and
i
could
make
out
to
choose
one
that
your
mother
would
think
was
quite
a
fright
come
this
way
and
let
us
see
if
she
do
like
it
she
can
give
it
away
you
know
he
led
the
delighted
ellen
into
a
milliner
shop
and
after
turning
over
a
great
many
different
articles
chose
her
a
nice
warm
hood
or
quilted
bonnet
it
was
of
dark
blue
silk
well
made
and
pretty
he
saw
with
great
satisfaction
that
it
fitted
ellen
well
and
would
protect
her
ears
nicely
and
having
paid
for
it
and
ordered
it
home
he
and
ellen
sallied
forth
into
the
street
again
but
he
would
let
her
thank
him
it
is
just
the
very
thing
i
wanted
sir
said
ellen
mamma
was
speaking
about
it
the
other
day
and
she
did
not
see
how
i
was
ever
to
get
one
because
she
did
not
feel
at
all
able
to
go
out
and
i
could
not
get
one
myself
i
know
she
like
it
very
much
would
you
rather
have
something
for
yourself
or
your
mother
ellen
if
you
could
choose
and
have
but
one
oh
for
mamma
sir
said
ellen
a
great
deal
come
in
here
said
he
let
us
see
if
we
can
find
anything
she
would
like
it
was
a
grocery
store
after
looking
about
a
little
the
old
gentleman
ordered
sundry
pounds
of
figs
and
white
grapes
to
be
packed
up
in
papers
and
being
now
very
near
home
he
took
one
parcel
and
ellen
the
other
till
they
came
to
the
door
of
green
hotel
where
he
committed
both
to
her
care
wo
you
come
in
sir
said
ellen
no
said
he
i
ca
this
time
i
must
go
home
to
dinner
and
sha
i
see
you
any
more
sir
said
ellen
a
shade
coming
over
her
face
which
a
minute
before
had
been
quite
joyous
well
i
do
know
said
he
kindly
i
hope
you
will
you
shall
hear
from
me
again
at
any
rate
i
promise
you
we
spent
one
pleasant
morning
together
have
we
ellen
hands
were
full
but
the
old
gentleman
took
them
in
both
his
packages
and
all
and
shook
them
after
a
fashion
and
again
bidding
her
walked
away
down
the
street
the
next
morning
ellen
and
her
mother
were
sitting
quietly
together
and
ellen
had
not
finished
her
accustomed
reading
when
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
my
old
gentleman
cried
ellen
as
she
sprang
to
open
it
no
there
was
no
old
gentleman
but
a
black
man
with
a
brace
of
beautiful
woodcocks
in
his
hand
he
bowed
very
civilly
and
said
he
had
been
ordered
to
leave
the
birds
with
miss
montgomery
ellen
in
surprise
took
them
from
him
and
likewise
a
note
which
he
delivered
into
her
hand
ellen
asked
from
whom
the
birds
came
but
with
another
polite
bow
the
man
said
the
note
would
inform
her
and
went
away
in
great
curiosity
she
carried
them
and
the
note
to
her
mother
to
whom
the
letter
was
directed
it
read
thus
will
montgomery
permit
an
old
man
to
please
himself
in
his
own
way
by
showing
his
regard
for
her
little
daughter
and
not
feel
that
he
is
taking
a
liberty
the
birds
are
miss
oh
mamma
exclaimed
ellen
jumping
with
delight
did
you
ever
see
such
a
dear
old
gentleman
now
i
know
what
he
meant
yesterday
when
he
asked
me
if
i
would
rather
have
something
for
myself
or
for
you
how
kind
he
is
to
do
just
the
very
thing
for
me
that
he
knows
would
give
me
the
most
pleasure
now
mamma
these
birds
are
mine
you
know
and
i
give
them
to
you
you
must
pay
me
a
kiss
for
them
mamma
they
are
worth
that
are
they
beauties
they
are
very
fine
indeed
said
montgomery
this
is
just
the
season
for
woodcock
and
these
are
in
beautiful
condition
do
you
like
woodcocks
mamma
yes
very
much
oh
how
glad
i
am
said
ellen
i
ask
sam
to
have
them
done
very
nicely
for
you
and
then
you
will
enjoy
them
so
much
the
waiter
was
called
and
instructed
accordingly
and
to
him
the
birds
were
committed
to
be
delivered
to
the
care
of
the
cook
now
mamma
said
ellen
i
think
these
birds
have
made
me
happy
for
all
day
then
i
hope
daughter
they
will
make
you
busy
for
all
day
you
have
ruffles
to
hem
and
the
skirts
of
your
dresses
to
make
we
need
not
wait
for
miss
rice
to
do
that
and
when
she
comes
you
will
have
to
help
her
for
i
can
do
little
you
ca
be
too
industrious
well
mamma
i
am
as
willing
as
can
be
this
was
the
beginning
of
a
pleasant
two
weeks
to
ellen
weeks
to
which
she
often
looked
back
afterwards
so
quietly
and
swiftly
the
days
fled
away
in
busy
occupation
and
sweet
intercourse
with
her
mother
the
passions
which
were
apt
enough
to
rise
in
ellen
mind
upon
occasion
were
for
the
present
kept
effectually
in
check
she
could
not
forget
that
her
days
with
her
mother
would
very
soon
be
at
an
end
for
a
long
time
at
least
and
this
consciousness
always
present
to
her
mind
forbade
even
the
wish
to
do
anything
that
might
grieve
or
disturb
her
love
and
tenderness
had
absolute
rule
for
the
time
and
even
had
power
to
overcome
the
sorrowful
thoughts
that
would
often
rise
so
that
in
spite
of
them
peace
reigned
and
perhaps
both
mother
and
daughter
enjoyed
this
interval
the
more
keenly
because
they
knew
that
sorrow
was
at
hand
all
this
while
there
was
scarcely
a
day
that
the
old
gentleman
servant
did
not
knock
at
their
door
bearing
a
present
of
game
the
second
time
he
came
with
some
fine
larks
next
was
a
superb
grouse
then
woodcock
again
curiosity
strove
with
astonishment
and
gratitude
in
ellen
mind
mamma
she
said
after
she
had
admired
the
grouse
for
five
minutes
i
can
not
rest
without
finding
out
who
this
old
gentleman
is
i
am
sorry
for
that
replied
montgomery
gravely
for
i
see
no
possible
way
of
your
doing
it
why
mamma
could
i
ask
the
man
that
brings
the
birds
what
his
name
is
he
must
know
it
certainly
not
it
would
be
very
dishonourable
would
it
mamma
why
this
old
gentleman
has
not
chosen
to
tell
you
his
name
he
wrote
his
note
without
signing
it
and
his
man
has
obviously
been
instructed
not
to
disclose
it
do
you
remember
he
did
not
tell
it
when
you
asked
him
the
first
time
he
came
now
this
shows
that
the
old
gentleman
wishes
to
keep
it
secret
and
to
try
to
find
it
out
in
any
way
would
be
a
very
unworthy
return
for
his
kindness
yes
it
would
be
doing
as
i
would
be
done
by
to
be
sure
but
would
it
be
mamma
very
it
is
very
dishonourable
to
try
to
find
out
that
about
other
people
which
does
not
concern
you
and
which
they
wish
to
keep
from
you
remember
that
my
dear
daughter
i
will
mamma
i
never
do
it
i
promise
you
even
in
talking
with
people
if
you
discern
in
them
any
unwillingness
to
speak
upon
a
subject
avoid
it
immediately
provided
of
course
that
some
higher
interest
does
not
oblige
you
to
go
on
that
is
true
politeness
and
true
kindness
which
are
nearly
the
same
and
to
do
so
i
assure
you
ellen
proves
one
wanting
in
true
honour
well
mamma
i
do
care
what
his
name
is
at
least
i
wo
try
to
find
out
but
it
does
worry
me
that
i
can
not
thank
him
i
wish
he
knew
how
much
i
feel
obliged
to
him
very
well
write
and
tell
him
so
mamma
said
ellen
opening
her
eyes
very
wide
can
i
would
you
certainly
if
you
like
it
would
be
very
proper
then
i
will
i
declare
that
is
a
good
notion
i
do
it
the
first
thing
and
then
i
can
give
it
to
that
man
if
he
comes
as
i
suppose
he
will
mamma
said
she
on
opening
her
desk
how
funny
do
you
remember
you
wondered
who
i
was
going
to
write
notes
to
here
is
one
now
mamma
it
is
very
lucky
i
have
got
more
than
one
sheet
of
it
was
ruined
before
ellen
had
satisfied
herself
with
what
she
wrote
it
was
a
full
hour
from
the
time
she
began
when
she
brought
the
following
note
for
her
mother
inspection
ellen
montgomery
does
not
know
how
to
thank
the
old
gentleman
who
is
so
kind
to
her
mamma
enjoys
the
birds
very
much
and
i
think
i
do
more
for
i
have
the
double
pleasure
of
giving
them
to
mamma
and
of
eating
them
afterwards
but
your
kindness
is
the
best
of
all
i
ca
tell
you
how
much
i
am
obliged
to
you
sir
but
i
will
always
love
you
for
all
you
have
done
for
me
ellen
montgomery
this
note
montgomery
approved
and
ellen
having
with
great
care
and
great
satisfaction
enclosed
it
in
an
envelope
succeeded
in
sealing
it
according
to
rule
and
very
well
montgomery
laughed
when
she
saw
the
direction
but
let
it
go
without
consulting
her
ellen
had
written
on
the
outside
to
the
old
gentleman
she
sent
it
the
next
morning
by
the
hands
of
the
same
servant
who
this
time
was
the
bearer
of
a
plump
partridge
to
miss
montgomery
and
her
mind
was
a
great
deal
easier
on
this
subject
from
that
time
chapter
vi
what
is
the
night
almost
at
odds

october
was
now
far
advanced
one
evening
the
evening
of
the
last
sunday
in
the
month
montgomery
was
lying
in
the
parlour
alone
ellen
had
gone
to
bed
some
time
before
and
now
in
the
stillness
of
the
sabbath
evening
the
ticking
of
the
clock
was
almost
the
only
sound
to
be
heard
the
hands
were
rapidly
approaching
ten
captain
montgomery
was
abroad
and
he
had
been
so
according
to
custom
or
in
bed
the
whole
day
the
mother
and
daughter
had
had
the
sabbath
to
themselves
and
most
quietly
and
sweetly
it
had
passed
they
had
read
together
prayed
together
talked
together
a
great
deal
and
the
evening
had
been
spent
in
singing
hymns
but
montgomery
strength
failed
here
and
ellen
sang
alone
was
not
soon
weary
hymn
succeeded
hymn
with
fresh
and
varied
pleasure
and
her
mother
could
not
tire
of
listening
the
sweet
words
and
the
sweet
airs
which
were
all
old
friends
and
brought
of
themselves
many
a
lesson
of
wisdom
and
consolation
by
the
mere
force
of
association
needed
not
the
recommendation
of
the
clear
childish
voice
in
which
they
were
sung
which
was
of
all
things
the
sweetest
to
montgomery
ear
she
listened
till
she
almost
felt
as
if
earth
were
left
behind
and
she
and
her
child
already
standing
within
the
walls
of
that
city
where
sorrow
and
sighing
shall
be
no
more
and
the
tears
shall
be
wiped
from
all
eyes
for
ever
ellen
next
hymn
however
brought
her
back
to
earth
again
but
though
her
tears
flowed
freely
while
she
heard
it
all
her
causes
of
sorrow
could
not
render
them
bitter
god
in
israel
sows
the
seeds
of
affliction
pain
and
toil
these
spring
up
and
choke
the
weeds
which
would
else
the
soil
trials
make
the
promise
sweet
trials
give
new
life
to
prayer
trials
bring
me
to
his
feet
lay
me
low
and
keep
me
there
it
is
so
indeed
dear
ellen
said
montgomery
when
she
had
finished
and
holding
the
little
singer
to
her
breast
i
have
always
found
it
so
god
is
faithful
i
have
seen
abundant
cause
to
thank
him
for
all
the
evils
he
has
made
me
suffer
heretofore
and
i
do
not
doubt
it
will
be
the
same
with
this
last
and
worst
one
let
us
glorify
him
in
the
fires
my
daughter
and
if
earthly
joys
be
stripped
from
us
and
if
we
be
torn
from
each
other
let
us
cling
the
closer
to
him
he
can
and
he
will
in
that
case
make
up
to
us
more
than
all
we
have
lost
ellen
felt
her
utter
inability
to
join
in
her
mother
expressions
of
confidence
and
hope
to
her
there
was
no
brightness
on
the
cloud
that
hung
over
them
it
was
all
dark
she
could
only
press
her
lips
in
tearful
silence
to
the
one
and
the
other
of
her
mother
cheeks
alternately
how
sweet
the
sense
of
the
coming
parting
made
every
such
embrace
this
one
for
particular
reasons
was
often
and
long
remembered
a
few
minutes
they
remained
thus
in
each
other
arms
cheek
pressed
against
cheek
without
speaking
but
then
montgomery
remembered
that
ellen
bedtime
was
already
past
and
dismissed
her
for
a
while
after
montgomery
remained
just
where
ellen
had
left
her
her
busy
thoughts
roaming
over
many
things
in
the
far
past
and
the
sad
present
and
the
uncertain
future
she
was
unconscious
of
the
passage
of
time
and
did
not
notice
how
the
silence
deepened
as
the
night
drew
on
till
scarce
a
footfall
was
heard
in
the
street
and
the
ticking
of
the
clock
sounded
with
that
sad
distinctness
which
seems
to
say
time
is
going
on
time
is
going
on
and
you
are
going
with
it
do
what
you
will
you
ca
help
that
it
was
just
upon
the
stroke
of
ten
and
montgomery
was
still
wrapped
in
her
deep
musings
when
a
sharp
brisk
footstep
in
the
distance
aroused
her
rapidly
approaching
and
she
knew
very
well
whose
it
was
and
that
it
would
pause
at
the
door
before
she
heard
the
quick
run
up
the
steps
succeeded
by
her
husband
tread
upon
the
staircase
and
yet
she
saw
him
open
the
door
with
a
kind
of
startled
feeling
which
his
appearance
now
invariably
caused
her
the
thought
always
darted
through
her
head
perhaps
he
brings
news
of
ellen
going
something
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
say
what
in
his
appearance
or
manner
confirmed
this
fear
on
the
present
occasion
her
heart
felt
sick
and
she
waited
in
silence
to
hear
what
he
would
say
seemed
very
well
pleased
sat
down
before
the
fire
rubbing
his
hands
partly
with
cold
and
partly
with
satisfaction
and
his
first
words
were
well
we
have
got
a
fine
opportunity
for
her
at
last
how
little
he
was
capable
of
understanding
the
pang
this
announcement
gave
his
poor
wife
but
she
only
closed
her
eyes
and
kept
perfectly
quiet
and
he
never
suspected
it
he
unbuttoned
his
coat
and
taking
the
poker
in
his
hand
began
to
mend
the
fire
talking
the
while
i
am
very
glad
of
it
indeed
said
he
it
quite
a
load
off
my
mind
now
we
be
gone
directly
and
high
time
it
is
i
take
passage
in
the
the
first
thing
and
this
is
the
best
possible
chance
for
ellen
everything
we
could
have
desired
i
began
to
feel
very
uneasy
about
it
it
was
getting
so
late
but
i
am
quite
relieved
now
who
is
it
said
montgomery
forcing
herself
to
speak
why
it
dunscombe
said
the
captain
flourishing
his
poker
by
way
of
illustration
you
know
her
do
you
captain
dunscombe
wife
she
going
right
through
thirlwall
and
will
take
charge
of
ellen
as
far
as
that
and
there
my
sister
will
meet
her
with
a
waggon
and
take
her
straight
home
could
be
anything
better
i
write
to
let
fortune
know
when
to
expect
her
dunscombe
is
a
lady
of
the
first
family
and
fashion
in
the
highest
degree
respectable
she
is
going
on
to
fort
jameson
with
her
daughter
and
a
servant
and
her
husband
is
to
follow
her
in
a
few
days
i
happened
to
hear
of
it
and
i
immediately
seized
the
opportunity
to
ask
if
she
would
not
take
ellen
with
her
as
far
as
thirlwall
and
dunscombe
was
only
too
glad
to
oblige
me
i
a
very
good
friend
of
his
and
he
knows
it
how
soon
does
she
go
why
that
the
only
part
of
the
business
i
am
afraid
you
wo
like
but
there
is
no
help
for
it
and
after
all
it
is
a
great
deal
better
so
than
if
you
had
time
to
wear
yourselves
out
with
mourning
better
and
easier
too
in
the
end
how
soon
repeated
montgomery
with
an
agonised
accent
why
i
a
little
afraid
of
startling
you
dunscombe
wife
must
go
he
told
me
morning
and
we
arranged
that
she
should
call
in
the
carriage
at
six
to
take
up
ellen
montgomery
put
her
hands
to
her
face
and
sank
back
against
the
sofa
i
was
afraid
you
would
take
it
so
said
her
husband
but
i
think
it
is
worth
while
it
is
a
great
deal
better
as
it
is
a
great
deal
better
than
if
she
had
a
long
warning
you
would
fairly
wear
yourself
out
if
you
had
time
enough
and
you
have
any
strength
to
spare
it
was
some
while
before
montgomery
could
recover
composure
and
firmness
enough
to
go
on
with
what
she
had
to
do
though
knowing
the
necessity
she
strove
hard
for
it
for
several
minutes
she
remained
quite
silent
and
quiet
endeavouring
to
collect
her
scattered
forces
then
sitting
upright
and
drawing
her
shawl
around
her
she
exclaimed
i
must
waken
ellen
immediately
waken
ellen
exclaimed
her
husband
in
his
turn
what
on
earth
for
that
the
very
last
thing
to
be
done
why
you
would
not
put
off
telling
her
until
morning
said
montgomery
certainly
i
would
that
the
only
proper
way
to
do
why
in
the
world
should
you
wake
her
up
just
to
spend
the
whole
night
in
useless
grieving
unfitting
her
utterly
for
her
journey
and
doing
yourself
more
harm
than
you
can
undo
in
a
week
no
no
just
let
her
sleep
quietly
and
you
go
to
bed
and
do
the
same
wake
her
up
indeed
i
thought
you
were
wiser
but
she
will
be
so
dreadfully
shocked
in
the
morning
not
one
bit
more
than
she
would
be
and
she
wo
have
so
much
time
to
feel
it
in
the
hurry
and
bustle
of
getting
off
she
will
not
have
time
to
think
about
her
feelings
and
once
on
the
way
she
will
do
well
enough
children
always
do
montgomery
looked
undecided
and
unsatisfied
i
take
the
responsibility
of
this
matter
on
myself
you
must
not
waken
her
absolutely
it
would
not
do
at
all
said
the
captain
poking
the
fire
very
energetically
it
would
not
do
at
all
i
can
not
allow
it
montgomery
silently
rose
and
lit
a
lamp
you
are
not
going
into
ellen
room
said
the
husband
i
must
i
must
put
her
things
together
but
you
not
disturb
ellen
said
he
in
a
tone
that
required
a
promise
not
if
i
can
help
it
twice
montgomery
stopped
before
she
reached
the
door
of
room
for
her
heart
failed
her
but
she
go
on
and
the
necessary
preparations
for
the
morrow
be
made
she
knew
it
and
repeating
this
to
herself
she
gently
turned
the
handle
of
the
door
and
pushed
it
open
and
guarding
the
light
with
her
hand
from
ellen
eyes
she
set
it
where
it
would
not
shine
upon
her
having
done
this
she
set
herself
without
once
glancing
at
her
little
daughter
to
put
all
things
in
order
for
her
early
departure
on
the
following
morning
but
it
was
a
bitter
piece
of
work
for
her
she
first
laid
out
all
that
ellen
would
need
to
wear
the
dark
merino
the
new
nankeen
coat
the
white
bonnet
the
clean
frill
that
her
own
hands
had
done
up
the
little
gloves
and
shoes
and
all
the
etceteras
with
the
thoughtfulness
and
the
carefulness
of
love
but
it
went
through
and
through
her
heart
that
it
was
the
very
last
time
a
mother
fingers
would
ever
be
busy
in
arranging
or
preparing
attire
the
very
last
time
she
would
ever
see
or
touch
even
the
little
inanimate
things
that
belonged
to
her
and
painful
as
the
task
was
she
was
loth
to
have
it
come
to
an
end
it
was
with
a
kind
of
lingering
unwillingness
to
quit
her
hold
of
them
that
one
thing
after
another
was
stowed
carefully
and
neatly
away
in
the
trunk
she
felt
it
was
last
act
words
might
indeed
a
few
times
yet
come
over
the
ocean
on
a
sheet
of
paper
but
sight
and
hearing
and
touch
must
all
have
done
henceforth
for
ever
keenly
as
montgomery
felt
this
she
went
on
busily
with
her
work
all
the
while
and
when
the
last
thing
was
safely
packed
shut
the
trunk
and
locked
it
without
allowing
herself
to
stop
and
think
and
even
drew
the
straps
and
then
having
finished
all
her
task
she
went
to
the
bedside
she
had
not
looked
that
way
before
ellen
was
lying
in
the
deep
sweet
sleep
of
childhood
the
easy
position
the
gentle
breathing
and
the
flush
of
health
upon
the
cheek
showed
that
all
causes
of
sorrow
were
for
the
present
far
removed
yet
not
so
far
either
for
once
when
montgomery
stooped
to
kiss
her
light
as
the
touch
of
that
kiss
had
been
upon
her
lips
it
seemed
to
awaken
a
train
of
sorrowful
recollections
in
the
little
sleeper
mind
a
shade
passed
over
her
face
and
with
gentle
but
sad
accent
the
word
mamma
burst
from
the
parted
lips
only
a
moment
and
the
shade
passed
away
and
the
expression
of
peace
settled
again
upon
her
brow
but
montgomery
dared
not
try
the
experiment
a
second
time
long
she
stood
looking
upon
her
as
if
she
knew
she
was
looking
her
last
then
she
knelt
by
the
bedside
and
hid
her
face
in
the
coverings
but
no
tears
came
the
struggle
in
her
mind
and
her
anxious
fear
for
the
morning
trial
made
weeping
impossible
her
husband
at
length
came
to
seek
her
and
it
was
well
he
did
she
would
have
remained
there
on
her
knees
all
night
he
feared
something
of
the
kind
and
came
to
prevent
it
montgomery
suffered
herself
to
be
led
away
without
making
any
opposition
and
went
to
bed
as
usual
but
sleep
was
far
from
her
the
fear
of
ellen
distress
when
she
would
be
awakened
and
suddenly
told
the
truth
kept
her
in
an
agony
in
restless
wakefulness
she
tossed
and
turned
uneasily
upon
her
bed
watching
for
the
dawn
and
dreading
unspeakably
to
see
it
the
captain
in
happy
unconsciousness
of
his
wife
distress
and
utter
inability
to
sympathise
with
it
was
soon
in
a
sound
sleep
and
his
heavy
breathing
was
an
aggravation
of
her
trouble
it
kept
repeating
what
indeed
she
knew
already
that
the
only
one
in
the
world
who
ought
to
have
shared
and
soothed
her
grief
was
not
capable
of
doing
either
wearied
with
watching
and
tossing
to
and
fro
she
at
length
lost
herself
a
moment
in
uneasy
slumber
from
which
she
suddenly
started
in
terror
and
seizing
her
husband
arm
to
arouse
him
exclaimed
it
is
time
to
wake
ellen
but
she
had
to
repeat
her
efforts
two
or
three
times
before
she
succeeded
in
making
herself
heard
what
is
the
matter
said
he
heavily
and
not
over
well
pleased
at
the
interruption
it
is
time
to
wake
ellen
no
it
is
said
he
relapsing
it
is
time
yet
this
great
while
oh
yes
it
is
said
montgomery
i
am
sure
it
is
i
see
the
beginning
of
dawn
in
the
east
nonsense
it
no
such
thing
it
the
glimmer
of
the
lamplight
what
is
the
use
of
your
exciting
yourself
so
for
nothing
it
wo
be
dawn
these
two
hours
wait
till
i
find
my
repeater
and
i
convince
you
he
found
and
struck
it
there
i
told
you
so
only
one
quarter
after
four
it
would
be
absurd
to
wake
her
yet
do
go
to
sleep
and
leave
it
to
me
i
take
care
it
is
done
in
proper
time
montgomery
sighed
heavily
and
again
arranged
herself
to
watch
the
eastern
horizon
or
rather
with
her
face
in
that
direction
for
she
could
see
nothing
but
more
quietly
now
she
lay
gazing
into
the
darkness
which
it
was
in
vain
to
try
to
penetrate
and
thoughts
succeeding
thoughts
in
a
more
regular
train
at
last
fairly
cheated
her
into
sleep
much
as
she
wished
to
keep
it
off
she
slept
soundly
for
nearly
an
hour
and
when
she
awoke
the
dawn
had
really
begun
to
break
in
the
eastern
sky
she
again
aroused
captain
montgomery
who
this
time
allowed
it
might
be
as
well
to
get
up
but
it
was
with
unutterable
impatience
that
she
saw
him
lighting
a
lamp
and
moving
about
as
leisurely
as
if
he
had
nothing
more
to
do
than
to
get
ready
for
breakfast
at
eight
oh
do
speak
to
ellen
she
said
unable
to
control
herself
never
mind
brushing
your
hair
till
afterwards
she
will
have
no
time
for
anything
oh
do
not
wait
any
longer
what
are
you
thinking
of
what
are
thinking
of
said
the
captain
there
plenty
of
time
do
quiet
yourself
you
getting
as
nervous
as
possible
i
going
immediately
montgomery
fairly
groaned
with
impatience
and
an
agonising
dread
of
what
was
to
follow
the
disclosure
to
ellen
but
her
husband
coolly
went
on
with
his
preparations
which
indeed
were
not
long
in
finishing
and
then
taking
the
lamp
he
at
last
went
he
had
in
truth
delayed
on
purpose
wishing
the
final
to
be
as
brief
as
possible
and
the
grey
streaks
of
light
in
the
east
were
plainly
showing
themselves
when
he
opened
the
door
of
his
little
daughter
room
he
found
her
lying
very
much
as
her
mother
had
left
her
in
the
same
quiet
sleep
and
with
the
same
expression
of
calmness
and
peace
spread
over
her
whole
face
and
person
it
touched
even
him
and
he
was
not
readily
touched
by
anything
it
made
him
loth
to
say
the
word
that
would
drive
all
that
sweet
expression
so
quickly
and
completely
away
it
must
be
said
however
the
increasing
light
warned
him
he
must
not
tarry
but
it
was
with
a
hesitating
and
almost
faltering
voice
that
he
said
ellen
she
stirred
in
her
sleep
and
the
shadow
came
over
her
face
again
ellen
ellen
she
started
up
broad
awake
now
and
both
the
shadow
and
the
peaceful
expression
were
gone
from
her
face
it
was
a
look
of
blank
astonishment
at
first
with
which
she
regarded
her
father
but
very
soon
indeed
that
changed
into
one
of
blank
despair
he
saw
that
she
understood
perfectly
what
he
was
there
for
and
that
there
was
no
need
at
all
for
him
to
trouble
himself
with
making
painful
explanations
come
ellen
he
said
that
a
good
child
make
haste
and
dress
there
no
time
to
lose
now
for
the
carriage
will
soon
be
at
the
door
and
your
mother
wants
to
see
you
you
know
ellen
hastily
obeyed
him
and
began
to
put
on
her
stockings
and
shoes
that
right
now
you
be
ready
directly
you
are
going
with
dunscombe
i
have
engaged
her
to
take
charge
of
you
all
the
way
quite
to
thirlwall
she
the
wife
of
captain
dunscombe
whom
you
saw
here
the
other
day
you
know
and
her
daughter
is
going
with
her
so
you
will
have
charming
company
i
dare
say
you
will
enjoy
the
journey
very
much
and
your
aunt
will
meet
you
at
thirlwall
now
make
haste
i
expect
the
carriage
every
minute
i
meant
to
have
called
you
before
but
i
overslept
myself
do
be
long
and
nodding
encouragement
her
father
left
her
how
did
she
bear
it
asked
montgomery
when
he
returned
like
a
little
hero
she
did
say
a
word
or
shed
a
tear
i
expected
nothing
but
that
she
would
made
a
great
fuss
but
she
has
all
the
old
spirit
that
you
need
to
have
and
have
yet
for
anything
i
know
she
behaved
admirably
montgomery
sighed
deeply
she
understood
far
better
than
her
husband
what
ellen
feelings
were
and
could
interpret
much
more
truly
than
he
the
signs
of
them
the
conclusions
she
drew
from
ellen
silent
and
tearless
reception
of
the
news
differed
widely
from
his
she
now
waited
anxiously
and
almost
fearfully
for
her
appearance
which
did
not
come
as
soon
as
she
expected
it
it
was
a
great
relief
to
ellen
when
her
father
ended
his
talking
and
left
her
to
herself
for
she
felt
she
could
not
dress
herself
so
quick
with
him
standing
there
and
looking
at
her
and
his
desire
that
she
should
be
speedy
in
what
she
had
to
do
could
not
be
greater
than
her
own
her
fingers
did
their
work
as
fast
as
they
could
with
every
joint
trembling
but
though
a
weight
like
a
mountain
was
upon
the
poor
heart
she
could
not
cry
and
she
could
not
pray
though
true
to
her
constant
habit
she
fell
on
her
knees
by
her
bedside
as
she
always
did
it
was
in
vain
all
was
in
a
whirl
in
her
heart
and
head
and
after
a
minute
she
rose
again
clasping
her
little
hands
together
with
an
expression
of
sorrow
that
it
was
well
her
mother
could
not
see
she
was
dressed
very
soon
but
she
shrank
from
going
to
her
mother
room
while
her
father
was
there
to
save
time
she
put
on
her
coat
and
everything
but
her
bonnet
and
gloves
and
then
stood
leaning
against
the
for
she
could
not
sit
down
watching
with
most
intense
anxiety
to
hear
her
father
step
come
out
of
the
room
and
go
downstairs
every
minute
seemed
too
long
to
be
borne
poor
ellen
began
to
feel
as
if
she
could
not
contain
herself
yet
five
had
not
passed
away
when
she
heard
the
roll
of
which
came
to
the
door
and
then
stopped
and
immediately
her
father
opening
the
door
to
come
out
without
waiting
any
longer
ellen
opened
her
own
and
brushed
past
him
into
the
room
he
had
quitted
montgomery
was
still
lying
on
the
bed
for
her
husband
had
insisted
on
her
not
rising
she
said
not
a
word
but
opened
her
arms
to
receive
her
little
daughter
and
with
a
cry
of
indescribable
expression
ellen
sprang
upon
the
bed
and
was
folded
in
them
but
then
neither
of
them
spoke
or
wept
what
could
words
say
heart
met
heart
in
that
agony
for
each
knew
all
that
was
in
the
other
no
not
quite
all
ellen
did
not
know
that
the
whole
of
bitterness
death
had
for
her
mother
she
was
tasting
then
but
it
was
true
death
had
no
more
power
to
give
her
pain
after
this
parting
should
be
over
his
afterwork
the
parting
between
soul
and
body
would
be
welcome
rather
yes
very
welcome
montgomery
knew
it
all
well
she
knew
this
was
the
last
embrace
between
them
she
knew
it
was
the
very
last
time
that
dear
little
form
would
ever
lie
on
her
bosom
or
be
pressed
in
her
arms
and
it
almost
seemed
to
her
that
soul
and
body
must
part
company
too
when
they
should
be
rent
asunder
ellen
grief
was
not
like
this
did
not
think
it
was
the
last
time
but
she
was
a
child
of
very
high
spirit
and
violent
passions
untamed
at
all
by
sorrow
discipline
and
in
proportion
violent
was
the
tempest
excited
by
this
first
real
trial
perhaps
too
her
sorrow
was
sharpened
by
a
sense
of
wrong
and
a
feeling
of
indignation
at
her
father
cruelty
in
not
waking
her
earlier
not
many
minutes
had
passed
in
this
sad
embrace
and
no
word
had
yet
been
spoken
no
sound
uttered
except
ellen
first
inarticulate
cry
of
mixed
affection
and
despair
when
captain
montgomery
step
was
again
heard
slowly
ascending
the
stairs
he
is
coming
to
take
me
away
thought
ellen
and
in
terror
lest
she
should
go
without
a
word
from
her
mother
she
burst
forth
with
mamma
speak
a
moment
before
and
montgomery
could
not
have
spoken
but
she
could
now
and
as
clearly
and
calmly
the
words
were
uttered
as
if
nothing
had
been
the
matter
only
her
voice
fell
a
little
towards
the
last
god
bless
my
darling
child
and
make
her
his
own
and
bring
her
to
that
home
where
parting
can
not
be
ellen
eyes
had
been
dry
until
now
but
when
she
heard
the
sweet
sound
of
her
mother
voice
it
opened
all
the
fountains
of
tenderness
within
her
she
burst
into
uncontrollable
weeping
it
seemed
as
if
she
would
pour
out
her
very
heart
in
tears
and
she
clung
to
her
mother
with
a
force
that
made
it
a
difficult
task
for
her
father
to
remove
her
he
could
not
do
it
at
first
and
ellen
seemed
not
to
hear
anything
that
was
said
to
her
he
was
very
unwilling
to
use
harshness
and
after
a
little
though
she
had
paid
no
attention
to
his
entreaties
or
commands
yet
sensible
of
the
necessity
of
the
case
she
gradually
relaxed
her
hold
and
suffered
him
to
draw
her
away
from
her
mother
arms
he
carried
her
downstairs
and
put
her
on
the
front
seat
of
the
carriage
beside
dunscombe
maid
but
ellen
could
never
recollect
how
she
got
there
and
she
did
not
feel
the
touch
of
her
father
hand
nor
hear
him
when
he
bid
her
and
she
did
not
know
that
he
put
a
large
paper
of
candies
and
in
her
lap
she
knew
nothing
but
that
she
had
lost
her
mother
it
will
not
be
so
long
said
the
captain
in
a
kind
of
apologising
way
she
will
soon
get
over
it
and
you
will
not
have
any
trouble
with
her
i
hope
so
returned
the
lady
rather
shortly
and
then
as
the
captain
was
making
his
parting
bow
she
added
in
no
very
pleased
tone
of
voice
pray
captain
montgomery
is
this
young
lady
to
travel
without
a
bonnet
bless
me
no
said
the
captain
how
is
this
has
she
a
bonnet
i
beg
a
thousand
pardons
i
bring
it
on
the
instant
after
a
little
delay
the
bonnet
was
found
but
the
captain
overlooked
the
gloves
in
his
hurry
i
am
very
sorry
you
have
been
delayed
said
he
i
hope
we
may
be
able
to
reach
the
boat
yet
replied
the
lady
drive
on
as
fast
as
you
can
a
very
polite
bow
from
captain
montgomery
a
very
slight
one
from
the
lady
and
off
they
drove
proud
enough
thought
the
captain
as
he
went
upstairs
again
i
reckon
she
do
thank
me
for
her
travelling
companion
but
off
that
one
good
thing
and
now
i
go
and
engage
berths
in
the
chapter
vii
so
fair
and
foul
a
day
i
have
not
seen
macbeth
the
long
drive
to
the
boat
was
only
a
sorrowful
blank
to
recollection
she
did
not
see
the
frowns
that
passed
between
her
companions
on
her
account
she
did
not
know
that
her
white
bonnet
was
such
a
matter
of
merriment
to
margaret
dunscombe
and
the
maid
that
they
could
hardly
contain
themselves
she
did
not
find
out
that
miss
margaret
fingers
were
busy
with
her
paper
of
sweets
which
only
a
good
string
and
a
sound
knot
kept
her
from
rifling
yet
she
felt
very
well
that
nobody
there
cared
in
the
least
for
her
sorrow
it
mattered
nothing
she
wept
on
in
her
loneliness
and
knew
nothing
that
happened
till
the
carriage
stopped
on
the
wharf
even
then
she
did
not
raise
her
head
dunscombe
got
out
and
saw
her
daughter
and
servant
do
the
same
then
after
giving
some
orders
about
the
baggage
she
returned
to
ellen
will
you
get
out
miss
montgomery
or
would
you
prefer
to
remain
in
the
carriage
we
must
go
on
board
directly
there
was
something
not
in
the
words
but
in
the
tone
that
struck
ellen
heart
with
an
entirely
new
feeling
her
tears
stopped
instantly
and
wiping
away
quick
the
traces
of
them
as
well
as
she
could
she
got
out
of
the
carriage
without
a
word
aided
by
dunscombe
hand
the
party
was
presently
joined
by
a
man
whom
ellen
recognised
as
captain
dunscombe
dunscombe
do
put
these
girls
on
board
will
you
and
then
come
back
to
me
i
want
to
speak
to
you
timmins
you
may
go
along
and
look
after
them
captain
dunscombe
obeyed
when
they
reached
the
deck
margaret
dunscombe
and
the
maid
timmins
went
straight
to
the
cabin
not
feeling
at
all
drawn
towards
their
company
as
indeed
they
had
given
her
no
reason
ellen
planted
herself
by
the
guards
of
the
boat
not
far
from
the
gangway
to
watch
the
busy
scene
that
at
another
time
would
have
had
a
great
deal
of
interest
and
amusement
for
her
and
interest
it
had
now
but
it
was
with
a
very
very
grave
little
face
that
she
looked
on
the
bustling
crowd
the
weight
on
her
heart
was
just
as
great
as
ever
but
she
felt
this
was
not
the
time
or
the
place
to
let
it
be
seen
so
for
the
present
she
occupied
herself
with
what
was
passing
before
her
though
it
did
not
for
one
moment
make
her
forget
her
sorrow
at
last
the
boat
rang
her
last
bell
captain
dunscombe
put
his
wife
on
board
and
had
barely
time
to
jump
off
the
boat
again
when
the
plank
was
withdrawn
the
men
on
shore
cast
off
the
great
loops
of
ropes
that
held
the
boat
to
enormous
wooden
posts
on
the
wharf
and
they
were
off
at
first
it
seemed
to
ellen
as
if
the
wharf
and
the
people
upon
it
were
sailing
away
from
them
backwards
but
she
presently
forgot
to
think
of
them
at
all
she
was
gone
she
felt
the
bitterness
of
the
whole
truth
the
blue
water
already
lay
between
her
and
the
shore
where
she
so
much
longed
to
be
in
that
confused
mass
of
buildings
at
which
she
was
gazing
but
which
would
be
so
soon
beyond
even
gazing
distance
was
the
only
spot
she
cared
for
in
the
world
her
heart
was
there
she
could
not
see
the
place
to
be
sure
nor
tell
exactly
whereabouts
it
lay
in
all
that
city
but
it
was
there
somewhere
and
every
minute
was
making
it
farther
and
farther
off
it
a
bitter
thing
that
sailing
away
from
all
one
loves
and
poor
ellen
felt
it
so
she
stood
leaning
both
her
arms
upon
the
rail
the
tears
running
down
her
cheeks
and
blinding
her
so
that
she
could
not
see
the
place
toward
which
her
straining
eyes
were
bent
somebody
touched
her
sleeve
it
was
timmins
dunscombe
sent
me
to
tell
you
she
wants
you
to
come
into
the
cabin
miss
hastily
wiping
her
eyes
ellen
obeyed
the
summons
and
followed
timmins
into
the
cabin
it
was
full
of
groups
of
ladies
children
and
nurses
bustling
and
noisy
enough
ellen
wished
she
might
have
stayed
outside
she
wanted
to
be
by
herself
but
as
the
next
best
thing
she
mounted
upon
the
bench
which
ran
all
round
the
saloon
and
kneeling
on
the
cushion
by
one
of
the
windows
placed
herself
with
the
edge
of
her
bonnet
just
touching
the
glass
so
that
nobody
could
see
a
bit
of
her
face
while
she
could
look
out
near
by
as
well
as
from
the
deck
presently
her
ear
caught
as
she
thought
the
voice
of
dunscombe
saying
in
rather
an
undertone
but
laughing
too
what
a
figure
she
does
cut
in
that
outlandish
bonnet
ellen
had
no
particular
reason
to
think
was
meant
and
yet
she
did
think
so
she
remained
quite
still
but
with
raised
colour
and
quickened
breathing
waited
to
hear
what
would
come
next
nothing
came
at
first
and
she
was
beginning
to
think
she
had
perhaps
been
mistaken
when
she
plainly
heard
margaret
dunscombe
say
in
a
loud
whisper
mamma
i
wish
you
could
contrive
some
way
to
keep
her
in
the
cabin
ca
you
she
looks
so
odd
in
that
queer
kind
of
a
thing
that
anybody
would
think
she
had
come
out
of
the
woods
and
no
gloves
too
i
should
like
to
have
the
miss
think
she
belonged
to
us
ca
you
mamma
if
a
thunderbolt
had
fallen
at
ellen
feet
the
shock
would
hardly
have
been
greater
the
lightning
of
passion
shot
through
every
vein
and
it
was
not
passion
only
there
was
hurt
feeling
and
wounded
pride
and
the
sorrow
of
which
her
heart
was
full
enough
before
now
wakened
afresh
the
child
was
beside
herself
one
wild
wish
for
a
was
the
most
pressing
thought
to
be
where
tears
could
burst
and
her
heart
could
break
unseen
she
slid
off
her
bench
and
rushed
through
the
crowd
to
the
red
curtain
that
cut
off
the
far
end
of
the
saloon
and
from
there
down
to
the
cabin
below
people
were
everywhere
at
last
she
spied
a
nook
where
she
could
be
completely
hidden
it
was
in
the
end
of
the
boat
just
under
the
stairs
by
which
she
had
come
down
nobody
was
sitting
on
the
three
or
four
large
mahogany
steps
that
ran
round
that
end
of
the
cabin
and
sloped
up
to
the
little
cabin
window
and
creeping
beneath
the
stairs
and
seating
herself
on
the
lowest
of
these
steps
the
poor
child
found
that
she
was
quite
screened
and
out
of
sight
of
every
human
creature
it
was
time
indeed
her
heart
had
been
almost
bursting
with
passion
and
pain
and
now
the
tempest
broke
forth
with
a
fury
that
racked
her
little
frame
from
head
to
foot
and
the
more
because
she
strove
to
stifle
every
sound
of
it
as
much
as
possible
it
was
the
very
bitterness
of
sorrow
without
any
softening
thought
to
allay
it
and
sharpened
and
made
more
bitter
by
mortification
and
a
passionate
sense
of
unkindness
and
wrong
and
through
it
all
how
constantly
in
her
heart
the
poor
child
was
reaching
forth
longing
arms
towards
her
mother
and
calling
in
secret
on
her
beloved
name
oh
mamma
mamma
was
repeated
numberless
times
with
the
unspeakable
bitterness
of
knowing
that
she
would
have
been
a
sure
refuge
and
protection
from
all
this
trouble
but
was
now
where
she
could
neither
reach
nor
hear
her
alas
how
soon
and
how
sadly
missed
ellen
distress
was
not
soon
quieted
or
if
quieted
for
a
moment
it
was
only
to
break
out
afresh
and
then
she
was
glad
to
sit
still
and
rest
herself
presently
she
heard
the
voice
of
the
chambermaid
upstairs
at
a
distance
at
first
and
coming
nearer
and
nearer
breakfast
ready
ladies
ladies
breakfast
ready
and
then
came
all
the
people
in
a
rush
pouring
down
the
stairs
over
ellen
head
she
kept
quite
still
and
close
for
she
did
not
want
to
see
anybody
and
could
not
bear
that
anybody
should
see
her
nobody
did
see
her
they
all
went
off
into
the
next
cabin
where
breakfast
was
set
ellen
began
to
grow
tired
of
her
and
to
feel
restless
in
her
confinement
she
thought
this
would
be
a
good
time
to
get
away
so
she
crept
from
her
station
under
the
stairs
and
mounted
them
as
quickly
and
as
quietly
as
she
could
she
found
almost
nobody
left
in
the
saloon
and
breathing
more
freely
she
possessed
herself
of
her
despised
bonnet
which
she
had
torn
off
her
head
in
the
first
burst
of
her
indignation
and
passing
gently
out
at
the
door
went
up
the
stairs
which
led
to
the
promenade
deck
she
felt
as
if
she
could
not
get
far
enough
from
dunscombe
the
promenade
deck
was
very
pleasant
in
the
bright
morning
sun
and
nobody
was
there
except
a
few
gentlemen
ellen
sat
down
on
one
of
the
settees
that
were
ranged
along
the
middle
of
it
and
much
pleased
at
having
found
herself
such
a
nice
place
of
retreat
she
once
more
took
up
her
interrupted
amusement
of
watching
the
banks
of
the
river
it
was
a
fair
mild
day
near
the
end
of
october
and
one
of
the
loveliest
of
that
lovely
month
poor
ellen
however
could
not
fairly
enjoy
it
just
now
there
was
enough
darkness
in
her
heart
to
put
a
veil
over
all
nature
brightness
the
thought
did
pass
through
her
mind
when
she
first
went
up
how
very
fair
everything
was
but
she
soon
forgot
to
think
about
it
all
they
were
now
in
a
wide
part
of
the
river
and
the
shore
towards
which
she
was
looking
was
low
and
distant
and
offered
nothing
to
interest
her
she
ceased
to
look
at
it
and
presently
lost
all
sense
of
everything
around
and
before
her
for
her
thoughts
went
home
she
remembered
that
sweet
moment
last
night
when
she
lay
in
her
mother
arms
after
she
had
stopped
singing
could
it
be
only
last
night
it
seemed
a
long
long
time
ago
she
went
over
again
in
imagination
her
shocked
waking
up
that
very
morning
how
cruel
that
was
her
hurried
dressing
the
miserable
parting
and
those
last
words
of
her
mother
that
seemed
to
ring
in
her
ears
yet
that
home
where
parting
can
not
be
oh
thought
ellen
how
shall
i
ever
get
there
who
is
there
to
teach
me
now
oh
what
shall
i
do
without
you
oh
mamma
how
much
i
want
you
already
while
poor
ellen
was
thinking
these
things
over
and
over
her
little
face
had
a
deep
sadness
of
expression
it
was
sorrowful
to
see
she
was
perfectly
calm
her
violent
excitement
had
all
left
her
her
lip
quivered
a
very
little
sometimes
but
that
was
all
and
one
or
two
tears
rolled
slowly
down
the
side
of
her
face
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
dancing
water
but
it
was
very
plain
her
thoughts
were
not
nor
on
anything
else
before
her
and
there
was
a
forlorn
look
of
hopeless
sorrow
on
her
lip
and
cheek
and
brow
enough
to
move
anybody
whose
heart
was
not
very
hard
she
was
noticed
and
with
a
feeling
of
compassion
by
several
people
but
they
all
thought
it
was
none
of
their
business
to
speak
to
her
or
they
did
know
how
at
length
a
gentleman
who
had
been
for
some
time
walking
up
and
down
the
deck
happened
to
look
as
he
passed
at
her
little
pale
face
he
went
to
the
end
of
his
walk
that
time
but
in
coming
back
he
stopped
just
in
front
of
her
and
bending
down
his
face
towards
hers
said
what
is
the
matter
with
you
my
little
friend
though
his
figure
had
passed
before
her
a
great
many
times
ellen
had
not
seen
him
at
all
for
her
eyes
were
with
her
heart
and
that
was
far
away
her
cheek
flushed
with
surprise
as
she
looked
up
but
there
was
no
mistaking
the
look
of
kindness
in
the
eyes
that
met
hers
nor
the
gentleness
and
grave
truthfulness
of
the
whole
countenance
it
won
her
confidence
immediately
all
the
floodgates
of
ellen
heart
were
at
once
opened
she
could
not
speak
but
rising
and
clasping
the
hand
that
was
held
out
to
her
in
both
her
own
she
bent
down
her
head
upon
it
and
burst
into
one
of
those
uncontrollable
agonies
of
weeping
such
as
the
news
of
her
mother
intended
departure
had
occasioned
that
first
sorrowful
evening
he
gently
and
as
soon
as
he
could
drew
her
to
a
retired
part
of
the
deck
where
they
were
comparatively
free
from
other
people
eyes
and
ears
then
taking
her
in
his
arms
he
endeavoured
by
many
kind
and
soothing
words
to
stay
the
torrent
of
her
grief
this
fit
of
weeping
did
ellen
more
good
than
the
former
one
that
only
exhausted
this
in
some
little
measure
relieved
her
what
is
all
this
about
said
her
friend
kindly
nay
never
mind
shedding
any
more
tears
about
it
my
child
let
me
hear
what
it
is
and
perhaps
we
can
find
some
help
for
it
oh
no
you
ca
sir
said
ellen
sadly
well
let
us
see
said
he
perhaps
i
can
what
is
it
that
has
troubled
you
so
much
i
have
lost
my
mother
sir
said
ellen
your
mother
lost
her
how
she
is
very
ill
sir
and
obliged
to
go
away
over
the
sea
to
france
to
get
well
and
papa
could
not
take
me
with
her
said
poor
ellen
weeping
again
and
i
am
obliged
to
go
to
be
among
strangers
oh
what
shall
i
do
have
you
left
your
mother
in
the
city
oh
yes
sir
i
left
her
this
morning
what
is
your
name
ellen
montgomery
is
your
mother
obliged
to
go
to
europe
for
her
health
oh
yes
sir
nothing
else
would
have
made
her
go
but
the
doctor
said
she
would
not
live
long
if
she
did
go
and
that
would
cure
her
then
you
hope
to
see
her
come
back
do
you
oh
yes
sir
but
it
wo
be
this
great
great
long
while
it
seems
to
me
as
if
it
was
for
ever
ellen
do
you
know
who
it
is
that
sends
sickness
and
trouble
upon
us
yes
sir
i
know
but
i
do
feel
that
that
makes
it
any
easier
do
you
know
he
sends
it
he
is
the
god
of
love
he
does
not
trouble
us
willingly
he
has
said
so
why
does
he
ever
make
us
suffer
do
you
know
no
sir
sometimes
he
sees
that
if
he
lets
them
alone
his
children
will
love
some
dear
thing
on
the
earth
better
than
himself
and
he
knows
they
will
not
be
happy
if
they
do
so
and
then
because
he
loves
them
he
takes
it
away
perhaps
it
is
a
dear
mother
or
a
dear
daughter
or
else
he
hinders
their
enjoyment
of
it
that
they
may
remember
him
and
give
their
whole
hearts
to
him
he
wants
their
whole
hearts
that
he
may
bless
them
are
you
one
of
his
children
ellen
no
sir
said
ellen
with
swimming
eyes
but
cast
down
to
the
ground
how
do
you
know
that
you
are
not
because
i
do
not
love
the
saviour
do
you
not
love
him
ellen
i
am
afraid
not
sir
why
are
you
afraid
not
what
makes
you
think
so
mamma
said
i
could
not
love
him
at
all
if
i
did
not
love
him
best
and
oh
sir
said
ellen
weeping
i
do
love
mamma
a
great
deal
better
you
love
your
mother
better
than
you
do
the
saviour
oh
yes
sir
said
ellen
how
can
i
help
it
then
if
he
had
left
you
your
mother
ellen
you
would
never
have
cared
or
thought
about
him
ellen
was
silent
is
it
so
would
you
do
you
think
i
do
know
sir
said
ellen
weeping
again
oh
sir
how
can
i
help
it
then
ellen
can
you
not
see
the
love
of
your
heavenly
father
in
this
trial
he
saw
that
his
little
child
was
in
danger
of
forgetting
him
and
he
loved
you
ellen
and
so
he
has
taken
your
dear
mother
and
sent
you
away
where
you
will
have
no
one
to
look
to
but
him
and
now
he
says
to
you
daughter
give
thy
heart
will
you
do
it
ellen
ellen
wept
exceedingly
while
the
gentleman
was
saying
these
words
clasping
his
hands
still
in
both
hers
but
she
made
no
answer
he
waited
till
she
had
become
calmer
and
then
went
on
in
a
low
tone
what
is
the
reason
that
you
do
not
love
the
saviour
my
child
mamma
says
it
is
because
my
heart
is
so
hard
that
is
true
but
you
do
not
know
how
good
and
how
lovely
he
is
or
you
could
not
help
loving
him
do
you
often
think
of
him
and
think
much
of
him
and
ask
him
to
show
you
himself
that
you
may
love
him
no
sir
said
ellen
not
often
you
pray
to
him
do
you
yes
sir
but
not
so
but
you
ought
to
pray
to
him
so
we
are
all
blind
by
nature
ellen
we
are
all
none
of
us
can
see
him
or
love
him
unless
he
opens
our
eyes
and
touches
our
hearts
but
he
has
promised
to
do
this
for
those
that
seek
him
do
you
remember
what
the
blind
man
said
when
jesus
asked
him
what
he
should
do
for
him
he
answered
that
i
may
receive
my
sight
that
ought
to
be
your
prayer
now
and
mine
too
and
the
lord
is
just
as
ready
to
hear
us
as
he
was
to
hear
the
poor
blind
man
and
you
know
he
cured
him
will
you
ask
him
ellen
a
smile
was
almost
struggling
through
ellen
tears
as
she
lifted
her
face
to
that
of
her
friend
but
she
instantly
looked
down
again
shall
i
put
you
in
mind
ellen
of
some
things
about
christ
that
ought
to
make
you
love
him
with
all
your
heart
oh
yes
sir
if
you
please
then
tell
me
first
what
it
is
that
makes
you
love
your
mother
so
much
oh
i
ca
tell
you
sir
everything
i
think
i
suppose
the
great
thing
is
that
she
loves
so
much
oh
yes
sir
said
ellen
strongly
but
how
do
you
know
that
she
loves
you
how
has
she
shown
it
ellen
looked
at
him
but
could
give
no
answer
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
must
bring
the
whole
experience
of
her
life
before
him
to
form
one
i
suppose
said
her
friend
that
to
begin
with
the
smallest
thing
she
has
always
been
watchfully
careful
to
provide
everything
that
could
be
useful
or
necessary
for
you
she
never
forgot
your
wants
or
was
careless
about
them
no
indeed
sir
and
perhaps
you
recollect
that
she
never
minded
trouble
or
expense
or
pain
where
your
good
was
concerned
she
would
sacrifice
her
own
pleasure
at
any
time
for
yours
ellen
eyes
gave
a
quick
and
strong
answer
to
this
but
she
said
nothing
and
in
all
your
griefs
and
pleasures
you
were
sure
of
finding
her
ready
and
willing
to
feel
with
you
and
for
you
and
to
help
you
if
she
could
and
in
all
the
times
you
have
seen
her
tired
no
fatigue
ever
wore
out
her
patience
nor
any
naughtiness
of
yours
ever
lessened
her
love
she
could
not
be
weary
of
waiting
upon
you
when
you
were
sick
nor
of
bearing
with
you
when
you
forgot
your
duty
more
ready
always
to
receive
you
than
you
to
return
is
it
so
oh
yes
sir
and
you
can
recollect
a
great
many
words
and
looks
of
kindness
and
love
many
and
many
endeavours
to
teach
you
and
lead
you
in
the
right
way
all
showing
the
strongest
desire
for
your
happiness
in
this
world
and
in
the
next
oh
yes
sir
said
ellen
tearfully
and
then
added
do
you
know
my
mother
sir
no
said
he
smiling
not
at
all
but
my
own
mother
has
been
in
many
things
like
this
to
me
and
i
judged
yours
might
have
been
such
to
you
have
i
described
her
right
yes
indeed
sir
said
ellen
exactly
and
in
return
for
all
this
you
have
given
this
dear
mother
the
love
and
gratitude
of
your
whole
heart
have
you
indeed
i
have
sir
and
ellen
face
said
it
more
than
her
words
you
are
very
right
he
said
gravely
to
love
such
a
mother
to
give
her
all
possible
duty
and
affection
she
deserves
it
but
ellen
in
all
these
very
things
i
have
been
mentioning
jesus
christ
has
shown
that
he
deserves
it
far
more
do
you
think
if
you
had
never
behaved
like
a
child
to
your
mother
if
you
had
never
made
her
the
least
return
of
love
or
regard
that
she
would
have
continued
to
love
you
as
she
does
no
sir
said
ellen
i
do
not
think
she
would
have
you
ever
made
any
fit
return
to
god
for
his
goodness
to
you
no
sir
said
ellen
in
a
low
tone
and
yet
there
has
been
no
change
in
kindness
just
look
at
it
and
see
what
he
has
done
and
is
doing
for
you
in
the
first
place
it
is
not
your
mother
but
he
who
has
given
you
every
good
and
pleasant
thing
you
have
enjoyed
in
your
whole
life
you
love
your
mother
because
she
is
so
careful
to
provide
for
all
your
wants
but
who
gave
her
the
materials
to
work
with
she
has
only
been
as
it
were
the
hand
by
which
he
supplied
you
and
who
gave
you
such
a
mother
there
are
many
mothers
not
like
her
who
put
into
her
heart
the
truth
and
love
that
have
been
blessing
you
ever
since
you
were
born
it
is
all
all
god
doing
from
first
to
last
but
his
child
has
forgotten
him
in
the
very
gifts
of
his
mercy
ellen
was
silent
but
looked
very
grave
your
mother
never
minded
her
own
ease
or
pleasure
when
your
good
was
concerned
did
christ
mind
his
you
know
what
he
did
to
save
sinners
do
you
yes
sir
i
know
mamma
often
told
me
he
was
rich
yet
for
our
sake
he
became
poor
that
we
through
his
poverty
might
be
rich
he
took
our
burden
of
sin
upon
himself
and
suffered
that
terrible
punishment
all
to
save
you
and
such
as
you
and
now
he
asks
his
children
to
leave
off
sinning
and
come
back
to
him
who
has
bought
them
with
his
own
blood
he
did
this
because
he
you
does
he
not
deserve
to
be
loved
in
return
ellen
had
nothing
to
say
she
hung
down
her
head
further
and
further
and
patient
and
kind
as
your
mother
is
the
lord
jesus
is
kinder
and
more
patient
still
in
all
your
life
so
far
ellen
you
have
not
loved
or
obeyed
him
and
yet
he
loves
you
and
is
ready
to
be
your
friend
is
he
not
even
taking
away
your
dear
mother
for
the
very
purpose
that
he
may
draw
you
gently
to
himself
and
fold
you
in
his
arms
as
he
has
promised
to
do
with
his
lambs
he
knows
you
can
never
be
happy
anywhere
else
the
gentleman
paused
again
for
he
saw
that
the
little
listener
mind
was
full
has
not
christ
shown
that
he
loves
you
better
even
than
your
mother
does
and
were
there
ever
sweeter
words
of
kindness
than
these
the
little
children
to
come
unto
me
and
forbid
them
not
for
of
such
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven
am
the
good
shepherd
the
good
shepherd
giveth
his
life
for
the
sheep
have
loved
thee
with
an
everlasting
love
therefore
with
have
i
drawn
thee
he
waited
a
minute
and
then
added
gently
will
you
come
to
him
ellen
ellen
lifted
her
tearful
eyes
to
his
but
there
were
tears
there
too
and
her
own
sank
instantly
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
sobbed
out
in
broken
words
oh
if
i
could
but
i
do
know
how
do
you
wish
to
be
his
child
ellen
oh
yes
sir
if
i
could
i
know
my
child
that
sinful
heart
of
yours
is
in
the
way
but
the
lord
jesus
can
change
it
and
will
if
you
will
give
it
to
him
he
is
looking
upon
you
now
ellen
with
more
kindness
and
love
than
any
earthly
father
or
mother
could
waiting
for
you
to
give
that
little
heart
of
yours
to
him
that
he
may
make
it
holy
and
fill
it
with
blessing
he
says
you
know
i
stand
at
the
door
and
knock
do
not
grieve
him
away
ellen
ellen
sobbed
but
all
the
passion
and
bitterness
of
her
tears
was
gone
her
heart
was
completely
melted
if
your
mother
were
here
and
could
do
for
you
what
you
want
would
you
doubt
her
love
to
do
it
would
you
have
any
difficulty
in
asking
her
oh
no
then
do
not
doubt
his
love
who
loves
you
better
still
come
to
jesus
do
not
fancy
he
is
away
up
in
heaven
out
of
reach
of
hearing
he
is
here
close
to
you
and
knows
every
wish
and
throb
of
your
heart
think
you
are
in
his
presence
and
at
his
feet
even
now
and
say
to
him
in
your
heart
look
upon
me
i
am
not
fit
to
come
to
thee
but
thou
hast
bid
me
come
take
me
and
make
me
thine
own
take
this
hard
heart
that
i
can
do
nothing
with
and
make
it
holy
and
fill
it
with
thy
love
i
give
it
and
myself
into
thy
hands
o
dear
saviour
these
words
were
spoken
very
low
that
only
ellen
could
catch
them
her
bowed
head
sank
lower
and
lower
till
he
ceased
speaking
he
added
no
more
for
some
time
waited
till
she
had
resumed
her
usual
attitude
and
appearance
and
then
said
ellen
could
you
join
in
heart
with
my
words
i
did
sir
i
could
help
it
all
but
the
last
all
but
the
last
yes
sir
but
ellen
if
you
say
the
first
part
of
my
prayer
with
your
whole
heart
the
lord
will
enable
you
to
say
the
last
too
do
you
believe
that
yes
sir
will
you
not
make
that
your
constant
prayer
till
you
are
heard
and
answered
yes
sir
and
he
thought
he
saw
that
she
was
in
earnest
perhaps
the
answer
may
not
come
at
once
it
does
not
always
but
it
will
come
as
surely
as
the
sun
will
rise
morning
shall
we
know
if
we
to
know
the
lord
but
then
you
must
be
in
earnest
and
if
you
are
in
earnest
is
there
nothing
you
have
to
do
besides
ellen
looked
at
him
without
making
any
answer
when
a
person
is
in
earnest
how
does
he
show
it
by
doing
everything
he
possibly
can
to
get
what
he
wants
quite
right
said
her
friend
smiling
and
has
god
bidden
us
to
do
nothing
besides
pray
for
a
new
heart
oh
yes
sir
he
has
told
us
to
do
a
great
many
things
and
will
he
be
likely
to
grant
that
prayer
ellen
if
he
sees
that
you
do
not
care
about
displeasing
him
in
those
many
things
will
he
judge
that
you
are
sincere
in
wishing
for
a
new
heart
oh
no
sir
then
if
you
are
resolved
to
be
a
christian
you
will
not
be
contented
with
praying
for
a
new
heart
but
you
will
begin
at
once
to
be
a
servant
of
god
you
can
do
nothing
well
without
help
but
you
are
sure
the
help
will
come
and
from
this
good
day
you
will
seek
to
know
and
to
do
the
will
of
god
trusting
in
his
dear
son
to
perfect
that
which
concerneth
you
my
little
child
said
the
gentleman
softly
and
kindly
are
you
ready
to
say
you
will
do
this
as
she
hesitated
he
took
a
little
book
from
his
pocket
and
turning
over
the
leaves
said
i
am
going
to
leave
you
for
a
little
while
i
have
a
few
moments
business
downstairs
to
attend
to
and
i
want
you
to
look
over
this
hymn
and
think
carefully
of
what
i
have
been
saying
will
you
and
resolve
what
you
will
do
ellen
got
off
his
knee
where
she
had
been
sitting
all
this
while
and
silently
taking
the
book
sat
down
in
the
chair
he
had
quitted
tears
ran
fast
again
and
many
thoughts
passed
through
her
mind
as
her
eyes
went
over
and
over
the
words
to
which
he
had
pointed
behold
the
saviour
at
the
door
he
gently
knocks
has
knocked
before
has
waited
long
is
waiting
still
you
treat
no
other
friend
so
oh
lovely
attitude
he
stands
with
open
heart
and
outstretched
hands
oh
matchless
kindness
and
he
shows
this
matchless
kindness
to
his
foes
admit
him
for
the
human
breast
entertained
so
kind
a
guest
admit
him
for
the
hour
at
hand
when
at
door
denied
you
stand
open
my
heart
lord
enter
in
slay
every
foe
and
conquer
sin
here
now
to
thee
i
all
resign
my
body
soul
and
all
are
thine
the
last
two
lines
ellen
longed
to
say
but
could
not
the
two
preceding
were
the
very
speech
of
her
heart
not
more
than
fifteen
minutes
had
passed
when
her
friend
came
back
again
the
book
hung
in
ellen
hand
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
floor
well
he
said
kindly
and
taking
her
hand
what
your
decision
ellen
looked
up
have
you
made
up
your
mind
on
that
matter
we
were
talking
about
yes
sir
ellen
said
in
a
low
voice
casting
her
eyes
down
again
and
how
have
you
decided
my
child
i
will
try
to
do
as
you
said
sir
you
will
begin
to
follow
your
saviour
and
to
please
him
from
this
day
forward
i
will
try
sir
said
ellen
meeting
his
eyes
as
she
spoke
again
the
look
she
saw
made
her
burst
into
tears
she
wept
violently
god
bless
you
and
help
you
my
dear
ellen
said
he
gently
passing
his
hand
over
her
head
but
do
not
cry
any
more
you
have
shed
too
many
tears
this
morning
already
we
will
not
talk
about
this
any
more
now
and
he
spoke
only
soothing
and
quieting
words
for
a
while
to
her
and
then
asked
if
she
would
like
to
go
over
the
boat
and
see
the
different
parts
of
it
ellen
joyful
agreement
with
this
proposal
was
only
qualified
by
the
fear
of
giving
him
trouble
but
he
put
that
entirely
by
chapter
viii
time
and
the
hour
run
through
the
roughest
day
shakespeare
the
going
over
the
boat
held
them
a
long
time
for
ellen
new
friend
took
kind
pains
to
explain
to
her
whatever
he
thought
he
could
make
interesting
he
was
amused
to
find
how
far
she
pushed
her
inquiries
into
the
how
and
the
why
of
things
for
the
time
her
sorrows
were
almost
forgotten
what
shall
we
do
now
said
he
when
they
had
at
last
gone
through
the
whole
would
you
like
to
go
to
your
friends
i
have
any
friends
on
board
sir
said
ellen
with
a
swelling
heart
have
any
friends
on
board
what
do
you
mean
are
you
alone
no
sir
said
ellen
not
exactly
alone
my
father
put
me
in
the
care
of
a
lady
that
is
going
to
thirlwall
but
they
are
strangers
and
not
friends
are
they
i
hope
you
do
think
ellen
that
strangers
can
not
be
friends
too
no
indeed
sir
i
do
said
ellen
looking
up
with
a
face
that
was
fairly
brilliant
with
its
expression
of
gratitude
and
love
but
casting
it
down
again
she
added
but
they
are
not
my
friends
sir
well
then
he
said
smiling
will
you
come
with
me
oh
yes
sir
if
you
will
let
me
and
if
i
sha
be
a
trouble
to
you
sir
come
this
way
said
he
and
we
see
if
we
can
not
find
a
nice
place
to
sit
down
where
no
one
will
trouble
us
such
a
place
was
found
and
ellen
would
have
been
quite
satisfied
though
the
gentleman
had
done
no
more
than
merely
to
permit
her
to
remain
there
by
his
side
but
he
took
out
his
little
bible
and
read
and
talked
to
her
for
some
time
so
pleasantly
that
neither
her
weariness
nor
the
way
could
be
thought
of
when
he
ceased
reading
to
her
and
began
to
read
to
himself
weariness
and
faintness
stole
over
her
she
had
had
nothing
to
eat
and
had
been
violently
excited
that
day
a
little
while
she
sat
in
a
dreamy
sort
of
quietude
then
her
thoughts
grew
misty
and
the
end
of
it
was
she
dropped
her
head
against
the
arm
of
her
friend
and
fell
fast
asleep
he
smiled
at
first
but
one
look
at
the
very
pale
little
face
changed
the
expression
of
his
own
he
gently
put
his
arm
round
her
and
drew
her
head
to
a
better
than
it
had
chosen
and
there
she
slept
till
the
rang
timmins
was
sent
out
to
look
for
her
but
timmins
did
not
choose
to
meddle
with
the
grave
protector
ellen
seemed
to
have
gained
and
dunscombe
declared
herself
rejoiced
that
any
other
hands
should
have
taken
the
charge
of
her
after
dinner
ellen
and
her
friend
went
up
to
the
promenade
deck
again
and
there
for
a
while
they
paced
up
and
down
enjoying
the
pleasant
air
and
the
quick
motion
and
the
lovely
appearance
of
everything
in
the
mild
hazy
sunlight
another
gentleman
however
joining
them
and
entering
into
conversation
ellen
silently
quitted
her
friend
hand
and
went
and
sat
down
at
the
side
of
the
boat
after
taking
a
few
turns
more
and
while
still
engaged
in
talking
he
drew
his
little
out
of
his
pocket
and
with
a
smile
put
it
into
ellen
hand
as
he
passed
she
gladly
received
it
and
spent
an
hour
or
more
very
pleasantly
in
studying
and
turning
it
over
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
stranger
having
left
him
ellen
friend
came
and
sat
down
by
her
side
how
do
you
like
my
little
book
said
he
oh
very
much
indeed
sir
then
you
love
hymns
do
you
yes
i
do
sir
dearly
do
you
sometimes
learn
them
by
heart
oh
yes
sir
often
mamma
often
made
me
i
have
learnt
two
since
i
have
been
sitting
here
have
you
said
he
which
are
they
one
of
them
is
the
one
you
showed
me
this
morning
sir
and
what
is
your
mind
now
about
the
question
i
asked
you
this
morning
ellen
cast
down
her
eyes
from
his
inquiring
glance
and
answered
in
a
low
tone
just
what
it
was
then
sir
have
you
been
thinking
of
it
since
i
have
thought
of
it
the
whole
time
sir
and
you
are
resolved
you
will
obey
christ
henceforth
i
am
resolved
to
try
sir
my
dear
ellen
if
you
are
in
earnest
you
will
not
try
in
vain
he
never
yet
failed
any
that
sincerely
sought
him
have
you
a
bible
oh
yes
sir
a
beautiful
one
mamma
gave
it
to
me
the
other
day
he
took
the
from
her
hand
and
turning
over
the
leaves
marked
several
places
in
pencil
i
am
going
to
give
you
this
he
said
that
it
may
serve
to
remind
you
of
what
we
have
talked
of
and
of
your
resolution
ellen
flushed
high
with
pleasure
i
have
put
this
mark
said
he
showing
her
a
particular
one
in
a
few
places
of
this
book
for
you
wherever
you
find
it
you
may
know
there
is
something
i
want
you
to
take
special
notice
of
there
are
some
other
marks
here
too
but
they
are
mine
are
for
you
thank
you
sir
said
ellen
delighted
i
shall
not
forget
he
knew
from
her
face
what
she
meant
not
the
the
day
wore
on
thanks
to
the
unwearied
kindness
of
her
friend
with
great
comparative
comfort
to
ellen
late
in
the
afternoon
they
were
resting
from
a
long
walk
up
and
down
the
deck
what
have
you
got
in
this
package
that
you
take
such
care
of
said
he
smiling
oh
candies
said
ellen
i
am
always
forgetting
them
i
meant
to
ask
you
to
take
some
will
you
have
some
sir
thank
you
what
are
they
almost
all
kinds
i
believe
sir
i
think
the
almonds
are
the
best
he
took
one
pray
take
some
more
sir
said
ellen
i
do
care
for
them
in
the
least
then
i
am
more
of
a
child
than
you
in
this
at
any
rate
for
i
do
care
for
them
but
i
have
a
little
headache
i
must
meddle
with
sweets
then
take
some
for
sir
please
do
said
ellen
dealing
them
out
very
freely
stop
stop
said
he
not
a
bit
more
this
wo
do
i
must
put
some
of
these
back
again
you
want
them
too
i
do
think
i
shall
said
ellen
i
have
wanted
to
touch
them
oh
you
feel
brighter
after
a
night
sleep
but
you
afraid
of
catching
cold
this
wind
is
blowing
pretty
fresh
and
you
been
bonnetless
all
day
what
the
reason
ellen
looked
down
and
coloured
a
good
deal
what
the
matter
said
he
laughing
has
any
mischief
befallen
your
bonnet
no
sir
said
ellen
in
a
low
tone
her
colour
mounting
higher
and
higher
it
was
laughed
at
this
morning
laughed
at
who
laughed
at
it
dunscombe
and
her
daughter
and
her
maid
did
they
i
do
see
much
reason
in
that
i
confess
what
did
they
think
was
the
matter
with
it
i
do
know
sir
they
said
it
was
outlandish
and
what
a
figure
i
looked
in
it
well
certainly
that
was
not
very
polite
put
it
on
and
let
me
see
ellen
obeyed
i
am
not
the
best
judge
of
ladies
bonnets
it
is
true
said
he
but
i
can
see
nothing
about
it
that
is
not
perfectly
proper
and
suitable
nothing
in
the
world
so
that
is
what
has
kept
you
all
day
did
your
mother
wish
you
to
wear
that
bonnet
yes
sir
then
that
ought
to
be
enough
for
you
will
you
be
ashamed
of
what
approved
because
some
people
that
have
probably
half
her
sense
choose
to
make
merry
with
it
is
that
right
he
said
gently
is
that
honouring
her
as
she
deserves
no
sir
said
ellen
looking
up
into
his
face
but
i
never
thought
of
that
before
i
am
sorry
never
mind
being
laughed
at
my
child
if
your
mother
says
a
thing
is
right
that
enough
for
you
let
them
laugh
i
wo
be
ashamed
of
my
bonnet
any
more
said
ellen
tying
it
on
but
they
made
me
very
unhappy
about
it
and
very
angry
too
i
am
sorry
for
that
said
her
friend
gravely
have
you
quite
got
over
it
ellen
oh
yes
sir
long
ago
are
you
sure
i
am
not
angry
now
sir
is
there
no
unkindness
left
towards
the
people
who
laughed
at
you
i
do
like
them
much
said
ellen
how
can
i
you
can
not
of
course
the
company
of
people
and
i
do
not
wish
that
you
should
but
you
can
and
ought
to
feel
just
as
kindly
disposed
towards
them
as
if
they
had
never
offended
you
just
as
willing
and
inclined
to
please
them
or
do
them
good
now
could
you
offer
miss
what
her
name
some
of
your
candies
with
as
hearty
goodwill
as
you
could
before
she
laughed
at
you
no
sir
i
could
i
do
feel
as
if
i
ever
wished
to
see
them
again
then
my
dear
ellen
you
have
something
to
do
if
you
were
in
earnest
in
the
resolve
you
made
this
morning
ye
forgive
unto
men
their
trespasses
my
heavenly
father
will
also
forgive
you
but
if
you
forgive
not
men
their
trespasses
neither
will
my
father
forgive
your
trespasses
he
was
silent
and
so
was
ellen
for
some
time
his
words
had
raised
a
struggle
in
her
mind
and
she
kept
her
face
turned
towards
the
shore
so
that
her
bonnet
shielded
it
from
view
but
she
did
not
in
the
least
know
what
she
was
looking
at
the
sun
had
been
some
time
descending
through
a
sky
of
cloudless
splendour
and
now
was
just
kissing
the
mountain
tops
of
the
western
horizon
slowly
and
with
great
majesty
he
sank
behind
the
distant
blue
line
till
only
a
glittering
edge
appeared
and
then
that
was
gone
there
were
no
clouds
hanging
over
his
setting
to
be
gilded
and
purpled
by
the
parting
rays
but
a
region
of
glory
long
remained
to
show
where
his
path
had
been
the
eyes
of
both
were
fixed
upon
this
beautiful
scene
but
only
one
was
thinking
of
it
just
as
the
last
glimpse
of
the
sun
had
disappeared
ellen
turned
her
face
bright
again
towards
her
companion
he
was
intently
gazing
towards
the
hills
that
had
so
drawn
ellen
attention
a
while
ago
and
thinking
still
more
intently
it
was
plain
so
though
her
mouth
had
been
open
to
speak
she
turned
her
face
away
again
as
suddenly
as
it
had
just
sought
his
he
saw
the
motion
however
what
is
it
ellen
he
said
ellen
looked
again
with
a
smile
i
have
been
thinking
sir
of
what
you
said
to
me
well
said
he
smiling
in
answer
i
ca
and
miss
dunscombe
as
well
as
if
they
had
done
so
to
me
but
i
will
try
to
behave
as
if
nothing
had
been
the
matter
and
be
as
kind
and
polite
to
them
as
if
they
had
been
kind
and
polite
to
me
and
how
about
the
the
oh
said
ellen
laughing
miss
margaret
may
have
them
all
if
she
likes
i
quite
willing
not
but
i
had
rather
give
them
to
you
sir
you
give
me
something
a
great
deal
better
when
i
see
you
try
to
overcome
a
wrong
feeling
you
must
rest
till
you
get
rid
of
every
bit
of
that
you
feel
for
this
and
any
other
unkindness
you
may
suffer
you
can
not
do
it
yourself
but
you
know
who
can
help
you
i
hope
you
have
asked
him
ellen
i
have
sir
indeed
keep
asking
him
and
he
will
do
everything
for
you
a
silence
of
some
length
followed
ellen
began
to
feel
very
much
the
fatigue
of
this
exciting
day
and
sat
quietly
by
her
friend
side
leaning
against
him
the
wind
had
changed
about
sundown
and
now
blew
light
from
the
south
so
that
they
did
not
feel
it
at
all
the
light
gradually
faded
away
till
only
a
silver
glow
in
the
west
showed
where
the
sun
had
set
and
the
sober
grey
of
twilight
was
gently
stealing
over
all
the
bright
colours
of
sky
and
river
and
hill
now
and
then
a
twinkling
light
began
to
appear
along
the
shores
you
are
very
tired
said
ellen
friend
to
her
i
see
you
are
a
little
more
patience
my
child
we
shall
be
at
our
journey
end
before
a
very
great
while
i
am
almost
sorry
said
ellen
though
i
tired
we
do
go
in
the
steamboat
do
we
sir
no
in
the
stage
shall
be
in
the
stage
sir
no
my
child
but
i
am
glad
you
and
i
have
spent
this
day
together
oh
sir
said
ellen
i
do
know
what
i
should
have
done
if
it
had
been
for
you
there
was
silence
again
and
the
gentleman
almost
thought
his
little
charge
had
fallen
asleep
she
sat
so
still
but
she
suddenly
spoke
again
and
in
a
tone
of
voice
that
showed
sleep
was
far
away
i
wish
i
knew
where
mamma
is
now
i
do
not
doubt
my
child
from
what
you
told
me
that
it
is
well
with
her
wherever
she
is
let
that
thought
comfort
you
whenever
you
remember
her
she
must
want
me
so
much
said
poor
ellen
in
a
scarcely
audible
voice
she
has
not
lost
her
best
friend
my
child
i
know
it
sir
said
ellen
with
whom
grief
was
now
getting
the
mastery
but
oh
it
just
near
the
time
when
i
used
to
make
the
tea
for
her
who
make
it
now
she
want
me
oh
what
shall
i
do
and
overcome
completely
by
this
recollection
she
threw
herself
into
her
friend
arms
and
sobbed
aloud
there
was
no
reasoning
against
this
he
did
not
attempt
it
but
with
the
utmost
gentleness
and
tenderness
endeavoured
as
soon
as
he
might
to
soothe
and
calm
her
he
succeeded
at
last
with
a
sort
of
despairing
submission
ellen
ceased
her
tears
and
arose
to
her
former
position
but
he
did
not
rest
from
his
kind
endeavours
till
her
mind
was
really
eased
and
comforted
which
however
was
not
long
before
the
lights
of
a
city
began
to
appear
in
the
distance
and
with
them
appeared
a
dusky
figure
ascending
the
stairs
which
upon
nearer
approach
proved
by
the
voice
to
be
timmins
is
this
miss
montgomery
said
she
i
ca
see
i
am
sure
it
so
dark
is
that
you
miss
montgomery
yes
said
ellen
it
is
i
do
you
want
me
if
you
please
miss
dunscombe
wants
you
to
come
right
down
almost
in
she
says
miss
i
come
directly
miss
timmins
said
ellen
do
wait
for
me
i
wo
be
a
minute
i
come
directly
miss
timmins
retired
standing
still
a
good
deal
in
awe
of
the
grave
personage
whose
protection
ellen
seemed
to
have
gained
i
must
go
said
ellen
standing
up
and
extending
her
hand
sir
she
could
hardly
say
it
he
drew
her
towards
him
and
kissed
her
cheek
once
or
twice
it
was
well
he
did
for
it
sent
a
thrill
of
pleasure
to
ellen
heart
that
she
did
not
get
over
that
evening
nor
all
the
next
day
god
bless
you
my
child
he
said
gravely
but
cheerfully
and
you
will
feel
better
i
trust
when
you
have
had
some
rest
and
refreshment
he
took
care
of
her
down
the
stairs
and
saw
her
safe
to
the
very
door
of
the
saloon
and
within
it
and
there
again
took
her
hand
and
kindly
bade
her
ellen
entered
the
saloon
only
to
sit
down
and
cry
as
if
her
heart
would
break
she
saw
and
heard
nothing
till
dunscombe
voice
bade
her
make
haste
and
be
ready
for
they
were
going
ashore
in
five
minutes
and
in
less
than
five
minutes
ashore
they
went
which
hotel
asked
the
servant
who
carried
her
baggage
the
eagle
or
foster
the
eagle
said
dunscombe
come
this
way
then
said
another
man
the
driver
of
the
eagle
carriage
now

in
if
you
please
dunscombe
put
her
daughter
in
but
it
full
said
she
to
the
driver

one
oh

said
the
driver
holding
the
door
open
there
plenty
of
room
for

in
if
you
please

there
in
less
than

minutes

said
dunscombe
miss
montgomery
would
you
rather

or
walk

timmins
how
far

it
said
ellen
oh

am
sure
not
far
say
quick
would
you
rather
walk
or
ride
i
would
rather
walk
if
you
please
said
ellen
very
well
said
dunscombe
getting
in
timmins
you
know
the
way
and
off
went
the
coach
with
its
load
but
tired
as
she
was
ellen
did
not
wish
herself
along
picking
a
out
of
the
crowd
she
and
timmins
now
began
to
make
their
way
up
one
of
the
comparatively
quiet
streets
it
was
a
strange
place
that
she
felt
she
had
lived
long
enough
in
the
place
she
had
left
to
feel
at
home
there
but
here
she
came
to
no
street
or
crossing
that
she
had
ever
seen
before
nothing
looked
familiar
all
reminded
her
that
she
was
a
traveller
only
one
pleasant
thing
ellen
saw
on
her
walk
and
that
was
the
sky
and
that
looked
just
as
it
did
at
home
and
very
often
ellen
gaze
was
fixed
upon
it
much
to
the
astonishment
of
miss
timmins
who
had
to
be
not
a
little
watchful
for
the
safety
of
ellen
feet
while
her
eyes
were
thus
employed
she
had
taken
a
great
fancy
to
ellen
however
and
let
her
do
as
she
pleased
keeping
all
her
wonderment
to
herself
take
care
miss
ellen
cried
timmins
giving
her
arm
a
great
pull
i
declare
i
just
saved
you
out
of
that
gutter
poor
child
you
are
dreadfully
tired
ai
you
yes
i
am
very
tired
miss
timmins
said
ellen
have
we
much
further
to
go
not
a
great
deal
dear
cheer
up
we
are
almost
there
i
hope
dunscombe
will
want
to
ride
one
of
these
days
herself
and
ca
oh
do
say
so
miss
timmins
said
ellen
i
do
wish
so
indeed
well
i
should
think
you
would
said
timmins
i
should
think
you
be
fit
to
poison
her
should
i
know
if
i
was
in
your
place
oh
no
said
ellen
that
would
be
right
that
would
be
very
wrong
wrong
said
timmins
why
would
it
be
wrong
she
has
behaved
good
to
you
yes
said
ellen
but
do
you
know
the
bible
says
if
we
do
not
forgive
people
what
they
do
to
us
we
shall
not
be
forgiven
ourselves
well
i
declare
said
miss
timmins
you
beat
all
but
here
the
eagle
at
last
and
i
am
glad
for
your
sake
dear
ellen
was
shown
into
the
ladies
parlour
she
was
longing
for
a
place
to
rest
but
she
saw
directly
it
was
not
to
be
there
the
room
was
large
and
barely
furnished
and
round
it
were
scattered
part
of
the
of
people
that
had
arrived
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
her
they
were
waiting
till
their
rooms
should
be
ready
ellen
silently
found
herself
a
chair
and
sat
down
to
wait
with
the
rest
as
patiently
as
she
might
few
of
them
had
as
much
cause
for
impatience
but
she
was
the
only
perfectly
mute
and
uncomplaining
one
there
her
two
companions
however
between
them
fully
made
up
her
share
of
fretting
at
length
a
servant
brought
the
welcome
news
that
their
room
was
ready
and
the
three
marched
upstairs
it
made
ellen
very
heart
glad
when
they
got
there
to
find
a
comfortably
furnished
with
a
bright
fire
burning
large
curtains
let
down
to
the
floor
and
a
nice
warm
carpet
upon
it
taking
off
her
bonnet
and
only
that
she
sat
down
on
a
low
cushion
by
the
corner
of
the
and
leaning
her
head
against
the
jamb
fell
fast
asleep
almost
immediately
dunscombe
set
about
arranging
herself
for
the
well
she
said
one
day
of
this
precious
journey
is
over
does
ellen
go
with
us
mamma
oh
yes
quite
to
thirlwall
well
you
have
had
much
plague
with
her
mamma

i
am
sure
i
am
much
obliged
to
whoever
has
kept
her
out
of
my
way
where
is
she
going
to
sleep
asked
miss
margaret
i
do
know
i
am
sure
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
have
a
cot
brought
in
here
for
her
what
a
plague
said
miss
margaret
it
will
lumber
up
the
room
so
there
no
place
to
put
it
could
she
sleep
with
timmins
oh
she
of
course
just
as
well
as
not
only
people
would
make
such
a
fuss
about
it
it
would
do
we
must
bear
it
for
once
try
and
not
be
caught
in
such
a
scrape
again
how
provoking
said
miss
margaret
how
came
father
to
do
so
without
asking
you
about
it
oh
he
was
bewitched
i
suppose
men
always
are
look
here
margaret
i
ca
go
down
to
tea
with
a
train
of
children
at
my
heels

up
here
and
i
send

margaret
eagerly

young
one
up
and
then

i
shall

upstairs
this
did
not
happen
however
ellen
sleep
was
much
too
deep
to
be
easily
disturbed
the
itself
loud
and
shrill
as
it
was
did
not
even
make
her
eyelids
tremble
after
and
miss
dunscombe
were
gone
down
timmins
employed
herself
a
little
while
in
putting
all
things
about
the
room
to
rights
and
then
sat
down
to
take
rest
dividing
her
attention
between
the
fire
and
ellen
towards
whom
she
seemed
to
feel
more
and
more
kindness
as
she
saw
that
she
was
likely
to
receive
it
from
no
one
else
presently
came
a
knock
at
the
door
the
tea
for
the
young
lady
on
a
waiter
miss
timmins
silently
took
the
tray
from
the
man
and
shut
the
door
well
said
she
to
herself
if
that
ai
a
pretty
supper
to
send
up
to
a
child
that

gone
two
hundred
miles
and
had
no
breakfast
a
cup
of
tea
cold
enough
i
warrant
bread
and
butter
enough
for
a
bird
and
two
little
slices
of
ham
as
thick
as
a
wafer
well
i
just
wish
dunscombe
had
to
eat
it
herself
and
nothing
else
i
not
going
to

great
indignation

and
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
she
met
a
girl

miss
timmins
filled
up
the
time
with
telling
her
new
friend
as
much
as
she
knew
about
ellen
and
ellen
hardships
with
which
miss
johns
was
so
much
interested
that
she
declared
she
must
go
up
and
see
her
and
when
james
in
a
few
minutes
returned
with
a
tray
of
nice
things
the
two
women
proceeded
together
to
dunscombe
room
ellen
had
moved
so
far
as
to
put
herself
on
the
floor
with
her
head
on
the
cushion
for
a
pillow
but
she
was
as
sound
asleep
as
ever
just
see
now
said
timmins
there
she
lies
on
the
floor
enough
to
give
her
her
death
of
cold
poor
child
she
tired
to
death
and
dunscombe
made
her
walk
up
from
the
steamboat
rather
than
do
it
herself
i
declare
i
wished
the
coach
would
break
down
only
for
the
other
folks
i
am
glad
i
have
got
a
good
supper
for
her
though
thank
miss
johns
and
i
tell
you
what
i
go
and
get
you
some
nice
hot
tea
said
the
chambermaid
who
was
quite
touched
by
the
sight
of
ellen
little
pale
face
thank
you
said
timmins
you
a
darling
this
is
as
cold
as
a
stone
while
the
chambermaid
went
forth
on
her
kind
errand
timmins
stooped
down
by
the
little
sleeper
side
miss
ellen
she
said
miss
ellen

up
dear

up
and
get
some
supper
come
you
feel
a
great
deal
better
for
it
you
shall
sleep
as
much
as
you
like
afterwards
slowly
ellen
raised
herself
and
opened
her
eyes
where
am
i
she
asked
looking
bewildered
here
dear
said
timmins
wake
up
and
eat
something
it
will
do
you
good
with
a
sigh
poor
ellen
arose
and
came
to
the
fire
you
tired
to
death
ai
you
said
timmins
not
quite
said
ellen
i
should
mind
that
if
my
legs
would
not
ache

and
my
head

timmins
but

head
will

better
for

nice
chicken
and
oysters
and

johns

servant
and
i

your
bridesmaid
with
the
greatest
pleasure
in
life
now
miss
ellen
dear
just

yourself
on
that
low
chair
and
i
fix
you
off
ellen
thanked
her
and
did
as
she
was
told
timmins
brought
another
chair
to
her
side
and
placed
the
tray
with
her
supper
upon
it
and
prepared
her
muffin
and
tea
and
having
fairly
seen
ellen
begin
to
eat
she
next
took
off
her
shoes
and
seating
herself
on
the
carpet
before
her
she
made
her
lap
the
for
ellen
feet
chafing
them
in
her
hands
and
heating
them
at
the
fire
saying
there
was
nothing
like
rubbing
and
roasting
to
get
rid
of
the
by
the
help
of
the
supper
the
fire
and
timmins
ellen
mended
rapidly
with
tears
in
her
eyes
she
thanked
the
latter
for
her
kindness
now
just
do
say
one
word
about
that
said
timmins
i
never
was
famous
for
kindness
as
i
know
but
people
must
be
kind
sometimes
in
their
lives
unless
they
happen
to
be
made
of
stone
which
i
believe
some
people
are
you
feel
better
do
you
a
great
deal
said
ellen
oh
if
i
only
could
go
to
bed
now
and
you
shall
said
timmins
i
know
about
your
bed
and
i
go
right
away
and
have
it
brought
in
and
away
she
went
while
she
was
gone
ellen
drew
from
her
pocket
her
little
to
refresh
herself
with
looking
at
it
how
quickly
and
freshly
it
brought
back
to
her
mind
the
friend
who
had
given
it
and
his
conversations
with
her
and
the
resolve
she
had
made
and
again
ellen
whole
heart
offered
the
prayer
she
had
repeated
many
times
that
day
open
my
heart
lord
enter
in
slay
every
foe
and
conquer
sin
her
head
was
still
bent
upon
her
little
book
when
timmins
entered
timmins
was
not
alone
miss
johns
and
a
little
cot
bedstead
came
in
with
her
the
latter
was
put
at
the
foot
of
dunscombe
bed
and
speedily
made
up
by
the
chambermaid
while
timmins
undressed
ellen
and
very
soon
all
the
sorrows
and
vexations
of
the
day
were
forgotten
in
a
sound
refreshing
sleep
but
not
till
she
had
removed
her
little
from
the
pocket
of
her
frock
to
a
safe
station
under
her
pillow
it
was
with
her
hand
upon
it
that
ellen
went
to
sleep
and
it
was
in
her
hand
still
when
she
was
waked
the
next
morning
the
next
day
was
spent
in
a
wearisome
over
a
rough
jolting
road
ellen
companions
did
nothing
to
make
her
way
pleasant
but
she
sweetened
theirs
with
her
somewhat
mollified
perhaps
after
that
miss
margaret
condescended
to
enter
into
conversation
with
her
and
ellen
underwent
a
thorough
as
to
all
her
own
and
her
parents
affairs
past
present
and
future
and
likewise
as
to
all
that
could
be
known
of
her
yesterday
friend
till
she
was
heartily
worried
and
out
of
patience
it
was
just
five
when
they
reached
her
ellen
knew
of
no
particular
house
to
go
to
so
dunscombe
set
her
down
at
the
door
of
the
principal
inn
of
the
town
called
the
star
of
thirlwall
the
driver
smacked
his
whip
and
away
went
the
stage
again
and
she
was
left
standing
alone
beside
her
trunk
before
the
piazza
of
the
inn
watching
timmins
who
was
looking
back
at
her
out
of
the
stage
window
nodding
and
waving
chapter

sirrah
carrier
what
time
do
you
mean
to
come
to
london
time
enough
to
go
to

with
a
candle
i
warrant
thee
king
henry
iv
ellen
had
been
whirled
along
over
the
roads
for
so
many
hours
the
rattle
of
the
had
filled
her
ears
for
so
long
that
now
suddenly
still
and
quiet
she
felt
half
stunned
she
stood
with
a
kind
of
dreamy
feeling
looking
after
the
departing
in
it
there
were
three
people
whose
faces
she
knew
and
she
could
not
count
a
fourth
within
many
a
mile
one
of
those
was
a
friend
too
as
the
fluttering
handkerchief
of
poor
miss
timmins
gave
token
still
yet
ellen
did
not
wish
herself
back
in
the
coach
although
she
continued
to
stand
and
gaze
after
it
as
it
rattled
off
at
a
great
rate
down
the
little
street
its
huge
body
lumbering
up
and
down
every
now
and
then
reminding
her
of
sundry
uncomfortable
jolts
till
the
horses
making
a
sudden
turn
to
the
right
it
disappeared
round
a
corner
still
for
a
minute
ellen
watched
the
whirling
cloud
of
dust
it
had
left
behind
but
then
the
feeling
of
strangeness
and
loneliness
came
over
her
and
her
heart
sank
she
cast
a
look
up
and
down
the
street
the
afternoon
was
lovely
the
slant
beams
of
the
setting
sun
came
back
from
gilded
windows
and
the
houses
and
of
the
little
town
were
in
a
glow
but
she
saw
nothing
bright
anywhere
in
all
the
glory
of
the
setting
sun
the
little
town
looked
strange
and
miserable
there
was
no
sign
of
her
having
been
expected
nobody
was
waiting
to
meet
her
what
was
to
be
done
next
ellen
had
not
the
slightest
idea
her
heart
growing
fainter
and
fainter
she
turned
again
to
the
inn
a
tall
awkward
young
countryman
with
a
cap
set
on
one
side
of
his
head
was
busying
himself
with
sweeping
the
floor
of
the
piazza
but
in
a
very
leisurely
manner
and
between
every
two
strokes
of
his
broom
he
was
casting
long
looks
at
ellen
evidently
wondering
who
she
was
and
what
she
could
want
there
ellen
saw
it
and
hoped
he
would
ask
her
in
words
for
she
could
not
answer
his
of
curiosity
but
she
was
disappointed
as
he
reached
the
end
of
the
piazza
and
gave
his
broom
two
or
three
knocks
against
the
edge
of
the
boards
to
clear
it
of
dust
he
indulged
himself
with
one
good
long
finishing
look
at
ellen
and
then
she
saw
he
was
going
to
take
himself
and
his
broom
into
the
house
so
in
despair
she
ran
up
the
two
or
three
low
steps
of
the
piazza
and
presented
herself
before
him
he
stopped
short
will
you
please
to
tell
me
sir
said
poor
ellen
if

emerson
is

emerson
said
he

eyeing
ellen
from
head
to
foot
the
man

his
broom
into
the
house
ellen
followed
him

said
he
forbes

emerson
said
another
man
with
a
big
red
face
and
a
big
round
body
showing
himself
in
a
doorway
which
he
nearly
filled
miss
emerson
that

little
way

of

and
the
man
with

broom

view
of

landlord
he
advanced
a
step
or
two
towards
her
what

said
he
i

shabby
of
her
and

and
he
shouted
wife
what
the
matter
mr
forbes
said
a
fat
landlady
appearing
in
the
doorway
which
she
filled
near
as
well
as
her
husband
would
have
done
look
here
said
forbes

visit

glad

see
her
forbes
put
this
question
with
rather
a
curious
look
at
his
wife
she
did
answer
him
she
only
looked
at
ellen
looked
grave
and
gave
a
queer
little
nod
of
her
head
which
meant
ellen
could
not
make
out
what
now
what
to
be
done
continued
forbes
miss
fortune
was
to
have
come
up
to
meet
her
but
she
ai
here
and
i
do
know
how
in
the
world

can
take
the

there
the
horses

both
out
to
plough
you
know
and
besides
the
tire
is
come
off
that
waggon
wheel
i
could
possibly
use
it
and
then
it
a
great
question
in
my
mind
what
miss
fortune
would
say
to
me
i
should
get
paid
i
yes
you
get
paid
said
his
wife
with
another
little
shake
of
her
head
but

would
be
the
kind
of
pay
you
like
know
well
what
to

and
then

and

forbes
herself
followed
sam
to
the
door
and
cast
an
exploring
look
in
every
direction
i
do
see
no
signs
of

up
nor

said
she
returning
to
ellen
but

here
and
rest

she
opened
a
door
and
ellen
followed
her
into
a
large
kitchen
where
a
fire
was
burning
that
showed
wood
must
be
plenty
in
those
regions
forbes
placed
a
low
chair
for
her
on
the
hearth
but
herself
remained
standing
by
the
side
of
the
fire
looking
earnestly
and
with
a
good
deal
of
interest
upon
the
little
stranger
ellen
drew
her
white
bonnet
from
her
head
and
sitting
down
with
a
wearied
air
gazed
sadly
into
the
flames
that
were
shedding
their
light
upon
her
are
you
going
to
stop
a
good
while
with
miss
fortune
said
forbes
i
do
know
yes
i
believe
so
said
ellen
faintly
you
got
no
mother
asked
forbes
suddenly
after
a
pause
oh
yes
said
ellen
looking
up
but
the
question
had
touched
the
sore
spot
her
head
sank
on
her
hands
and
oh
mamma
was
uttered
with
a
bitterness
that
even
forbes
could
feel
now
what
made
me
ask
you
that
said
she
do
cry
do
love
poor
little
dear
you
as
pale
as
a
sheet
you
tired
i
know
you
now
cheer
up

i
ca
bear
to
see
you
cry
you
come
a
great
ways
you
ellen
nodded
her
head
but
could
give
no
answer
i
know
what
will
do
you
good
said
forbes
presently
getting
up
from
the
crouching
posture
she
had
taken
to
comfort
ellen
you
want
something
to
eat
that
the
matter
i
warrant
you
half
starved
no
wonder
you
feel
bad
poor
little
thing
you
shall
have
something
good
directly
and
away
she
bustled
to
get
it
left
alone
ellen
tears
flowed
a
few
minutes
very
fast
she
felt
forlorn
and
she
was
besides
as
forbes
opined
both
tired
and
faint
but
she
did
not
wish
to
be
found
weeping
she
checked
her
tears
and
was
sitting
again
quietly
before
the
fire
when
the
landlady
returned
forbes
had
a
great
bowl
of
milk
in
one
hand
and
a
plate
of
bread
in
the
other
which
she
placed
on
the
kitchen
table
and
setting
a
chair
called
ellen
to
come
and
partake
of
it
come
dear
here
is
something
that
will
do
you
good
i
thought
there
was
a
piece
of
pie
in
the
buttery
and
so
there
was
but
forbes
must
have
got
hold
of
it
for
it
ai
there
now
and
there
ai
a
bit
of
cake
in
the
house
for
you
but
i
thought
maybe
you
would
like
this
as
well
as
anything
come
ellen
thanked
her
but
said
she
did
not
want
anything
oh
yes
you
do
said
forbes
i
know
better
you
as
pale
as
i
do
know
what
come

put
roses
in
your
cheek
do
you
like
bread
and
milk
yes
very
much
indeed
said
ellen
but
i
not
hungry
she
rose
however
and
came
to
the
table
oh
well
try
to
eat
a
bit
just
to
please
me
it
real
good
country
milk
not
a
bit
of
cream
off
you

such
milk
as

the
city

guess

your
cheeks

your
pa
in
new
york

pa
and
ma
up
to
thirlwall
do
you
no
forbes
was
surprised
and
longed
to
ask
why
not
and
what
ellen
had
come
for
but
the
shade
that
had
passed
over
her
face
as
she
answered
the
last
question
warned
the
landlady
she
was
getting
upon
dangerous
ground
does
your
aunt
expect
you
i
believe
so
i
do
know
she
was
to
have
met
me
papa
said
he
would
write
oh
well
maybe
something
hindered
her
from
coming
it
no
matter
you
get
home
just
as
well
van
brunt
will
be
here
soon
i
guess
it
most
time
for
him
to
be
along
she
went
to
the
front
door
to
look
out
for
him
but
returned
without
any
news
a
few
minutes
passed
in
silence
for
though
full
of
curiosity
the
good
landlady
dared
not
ask
what
she
wanted
to
know
for
fear
of
again
exciting
the
sorrow
of
her
little
companion
she
contented
herself
with
looking
at
ellen
who
on
her
part
much
rested
and
refreshed
had
turned
from
the
table
and
was
again
though
somewhat
less
sadly
gazing
into
the
fire
presently
the
great
wooden
clock
struck
five
with
a
whirling
rickety
voice
for
all
the
world
like
a
horse
grasshopper
ellen
at
first
wondered
where
it
came
from
and
was
looking
at
the
clumsy
machine
that
reached
nearly
from
the
floor
of
the
kitchen
to
the
ceiling
when
a
door
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
opened
and
good
day
forbes
in
a
rough
but
not
unpleasant
voice
brought
her
head
quickly
round
in
that
direction
there
stood
a
large
man
with
an
in
his
hand
he
was
and
rather
handsome
but
there
was
something
of
heaviness
in
the
air
of
both
face
and
person
mixed
with
his
certainly
expression
his
dress
was
as
rough
as
his
voice
a
grey
green
velveteen
pantaloons
and
a
fur
cap
that
had
seen
its
best
days
some
time
ago
good

by
the
stage
a
little
while
ago
and
the
thing
is
how
to
get
her
down
she
can
go
in
the
cart
ca
she
van
brunt
looked
a
little
doubtful
and
pulling
off
his
cap
with
one
hand
while
he
scratched
his
head
with
the
other
he
examined
ellen
from
head
to
foot
much
as
if
she
had
been
some
great
bale
of
goods
and
he
were
considering
whether
his
cart
would
hold
her
or
not
well
said
he
at
length
i
do

but
she
can
but
there

down
upon
oh

forbes

her
trunk
into
the
cart
will
you
van
brunt
and
i
see
to
the
rest
van
brunt
moved
off
without
another
word
to
do
what
was
desired
of
him
apparently
quite
confounded
at
having
a
passenger
instead
of
his
more
wonted
load
of
bags
and
barrels
and
his
face
still
continued
to
wear
the
singular
doubtful
expression
it
had
put
on
at
first
hearing
the
news
ellen
trunk
was
quickly
hoisted
in
however
and
forbes
presently
appeared
with
a
little
armchair
which
van
brunt
with
an
approving
look
bestowed
in
the
cart
planting
it
with
its
back
against
the
trunk
to
keep
it
steady
forbes
then
raising
herself
on
tiptoe
by
the
side
of
the
cart
took
a
view
of
the
arrangements
that
wo
do
yet
said
she
her
feet
will
be
cold
on
that
bare
floor
and
over
clean
neither
here
sally
run
up
and
fetch
me
that
piece
of
carpet
you
find
lying
at
the
top
of
the
now
hurry
now
van
brunt
i
depend
upon
you
to
get
my
things
back
again
will

see
and
bring
the
first
time
you
come
in
town
i
see
about
it
but
what
if
i
ca
get
hold
of
them
answered
the
person
addressed
with
a
half
smile
oh
said
forbes
with
another
i
leave
that
to
you
you
have
your
ways
and
means
now
just
spread
this
carpet
down
nicely
under
her
chair
and
then
she
be
fixed
now
my
darling
you
ride
like
a
queen
but
how
are
you
going
to
get
in
will
you
let
van
brunt
lift
you
up
ellen
oh
no
if
you
please
was
accompanied
with
such
an
evident
shrinking
from
the
proposal
that
forbes
did
not
press
it
a
chair
was
brought
from
the
kitchen
and
by
making
a
long
step
from
it
to
the
top
of
the
wheel
and
then
to
the
edge
of
the
cart
ellen
was
at
length
safely
stowed
in
her
place
kind
forbes
then
stretched
herself
up
over
the
side
of
the
cart
to
shake
hands
with
her
and
bid
her
telling
her
again
she
would
ride
like
a
queen
ellen
answered
only
but
it
was
said
with
a
look
of
so
much
sweetness
and
eyes
swimming
half
in
sadness
and
half
in
gratefulness
that
the
good
landlady
could
not
forget
it
i
do
think
said
she
when
she
went
back
to
her
husband
that
is
the
dearest
little
thing
about
i
ever
did
see
humph
said
her
husband
i
reckon
miss
fortune
will
think
so
too
the
doubtful
look
came
back
to
forbes
face
and
with
another
little
grave
shake
of
her
head
she
went
into
the
kitchen
how
kind
she
is
how
good
everybody
is
to
me
thought
little
ellen
as
she
moved
off
in
state
in
her
chariot
drawn
by
oxen
quite
a
contrast
this
new
way
of
travelling
was
to
the
noisy
stage
and
swift
steamer
ellen
did
not
know
at
first
whether
to
like
or
dislike
it
but
she
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
very
funny
and
a
remarkably
amusing
way
of
getting
along
there
was
one
disadvantage
about
it
certainly
their
rate
of
travel
was
very
slow
ellen
wondered
her
charioteer
did
not
make
his
animals
go
faster
but
she
soon
forgot
their
lazy
progress
in
the
interest
of
novel
sights
and
new
scenes
slowly
very
slowly
the
good
oxen
drew
the
cart
and
the
little
queen
in
the
out
of
the
town
and
they
entered
upon
the
open
country
the
sun
had
already
gone
down
when
they
left
the
inn
and
the
glow
of
his
setting
had
faded
a
good
deal
by
the
time
they
got
quite
out
of
the
town
but
light
enough
was
left
still
to
delight
ellen
with
the
pleasant
look
of
the
country
it
was
a
lovely
evening
and
quiet
as
summer
not
a
breath
stirring
the
leaves
were
all
off
the
trees
the
hills
were
brown
but
the
soft
warm
light
that
still
lingered
upon
them
forbade
any
look
of
harshness
or
dreariness
these
hills
lay
towards
the
west
and
at
thirlwall
were
not
more
than
two
miles
distant
but
sloping
off
more
to
the
west
as
the
range
extended
in
a
southerly
direction
between
the
ground
was
beautifully
broken
rich
fields
and
meadows
lay
on
all
sides
sometimes
level
and
sometimes
with
a
soft
wavy
surface
where
ellen
thought
it
must
be
charming
to
run
up
and
down
every
now
and
then
these
were
varied
by
a
little
rising
ground
capped
with
a
piece
of
woodland
and
beautiful
trees
many
of
them
were
seen
standing
alone
especially
by
the
roadside
all
had
a
cheerful
pleasant
look
the
houses
were
very
scattered
in
the
whole
way
they
passed
but
few
ellen
heart
regularly
began
to
beat
when
they
came
in
sight
of
one
and
i
wonder
if
that
is
aunt
fortune
house
perhaps
it
is
or
i
hope
it
is
not
were
the
thoughts
that
rose
in
her
mind
but
slowly
the
oxen
brought
her
abreast
of
the
houses
one
after
another
and
slowly
they
passed
on
beyond
and
there
was
no
sign
of
getting
home
yet
their
way
was
through
pleasant
lanes
towards
the
south
but
constantly
approaching
the
hills
about
half
a
mile
from
thirlwall
they
crossed
a
little
river
not
more
than
thirty
yards
broad
and
after
that
the
twilight
deepened
fast
the
shades
gathered
on
field
and
hill
everything
grew
brown
and
then
dusky
and
then
ellen
was
obliged
to
content
herself
with
what
was
very
near
for
further
than
that
she
could
only
see
the
outlines
she
began
again
to
think
of
their
slow
travelling
and
to
wonder
that
van
brunt
could
be
content
with
it
she
wondered
too
what
made
him
walk
when
he
might
just
as
well
have
sat
in
the
cart
the
truth
was
he
had
chosen
that
for
the
purpose
that
he
might
have
a
good
look
at
the
little
queen
in
the
apparently
however
he
too
now
thought
it
might
be
as
well
to
make
a
little
haste
for
he
thundered
out
some
orders
to
his
oxen
accompanied
with
two
or
three
strokes
of
his
heavy
lash
which
though
not
cruel
by
any
means
went
to
ellen
heart
them
lazy
critters
wo
go
fast
anyhow
said
he
to
ellen
they
will
take
their
own
time
it
ai
no
use
to
cut
them
oh
no
pray
do
if
you
please
said
ellen
in
a
voice
of
earnest
entreaty
fair
neither
continued
van
brunt
lashing
his
great
whip
from
side
to
side
without
touching
anything
i
have
seen
critters
that
would
take
any
quantity
of
whipping
to
make
them
go
but
them
of
that
kind
they
work
as
long
as
they
can
stand
poor
fellows
there
was
a
little
silence
during
which
ellen
eyed
her
rough
charioteer
not
knowing
exactly
what
to
make
of
him
i
guess
this
is
the
first
time
you
ever
rid
in
an
ai
it
yes
said
ellen
i
never
saw
one
before
you
never
seen
an
well
how
do
you
like
it
i
like
it
very
much
indeed
have
we
much
further
to
go
before
we
get
to
aunt
fortune
house
fortune
house
a
pretty
good
bit
yet
you
see
that
mountain
over
there
pointing
with
his
whip
to
a
hill
directly
west
of
them
and
about
a
mile
distant
yes
said
ellen
that
the
nose
then
you
see
that
other
pointing
to
one
that
lay
some
two
miles
further
south
miss
fortune
house
is
just
this
side
of
that
it
all
of
two
miles
from
here
and
urged
by
this
recollection
he
again
scolded
and
cheered
the
patient
oxen
who
for
the
most
part
kept
on
their
steady
way
without
any
reminder
but
perhaps
it
was
for
ellen
sake
that
he
scarcely
touched
them
with
the
whip
that
do
hurt
them
not
a
bit
he
remarked
to
ellen
it
only
lets
them
know
that
i
here
and
they
must
mind
their
business
so
miss
fortune
niece
eh
yes
said
ellen
well
said
van
brunt
with
a
desperate
attempt
at
being
complimentary
i
should
care
if
you
was
mine
too
ellen
was
somewhat
astounded
and
so
utterly
unable
to
echo
the
wish
that
she
said
nothing
she
did
not
know
it
but
van
brunt
had
made
for
him
most
extraordinary
efforts
at
sociability
having
quite
exhausted
himself
he
now
mounted
into
the
cart
and
sat
silent
only
now
and
then
uttering
energetic
gee
and
haw
which
greatly
excited
ellen
wonderment
she
discovered
they
were
meant
for
the
ears
of
the
oxen
but
more
than
that
she
could
not
make
out
they
plodded
along
very
slowly
and
the
evening
fell
fast
as
they
left
behind
the
hill
which
van
brunt
had
called
the
nose
they
could
see
through
an
opening
in
the
mountains
a
bit
of
the
western
horizon
and
some
brightness
still
lingering
there
but
it
was
soon
hid
from
view
and
darkness
veiled
the
whole
country
ellen
could
amuse
herself
no
longer
with
looking
about
she
could
see
nothing
very
clearly
but
the
outline
of
van
brunt
broad
back
just
before
her
but
the
stars
had
come
out
and
brilliant
and
clear
they
were
looking
down
upon
her
with
their
thousand
eyes
ellen
heart
jumped
when
she
saw
them
with
a
mixed
feeling
of
pleasure
and
sadness
they
carried
her
right
back
to
the
last
evening
when
she
was
walking
up
the
hill
with
timmins
she
remembered
her
anger
against
dunscombe
and
her
kind
warning
not
to
indulge
it
and
all
his
teaching
that
day
and
tears
came
with
the
thought
how
glad
she
should
be
to
hear
him
speak
to
her
again
still
looking
up
at
the
beautiful
quiet
stars
she
thought
of
her
dear
mother
how
long
it
was
already
since
she
had
seen
her
faster
and
faster
the
tears
dropped
and
then
she
thought
of
that
glorious
one
who
had
made
the
stars
and
was
above
them
all
and
who
could
and
did
see
her
mother
and
her
though
ever
so
far
apart
and
could
hear
and
bless
them
both
the
little
face
was
no
longer
upturned
it
was
buried
in
her
hands
and
bowed
to
her
lap
and
tears
streamed
as
she
prayed
that
god
would
bless
her
dear
mother
and
take
care
of
her
not
once
nor
twice
the
fulness
of
ellen
heart
could
not
be
poured
out
in
one
asking
greatly
comforted
at
last
at
having
as
it
were
laid
over
the
care
of
her
mother
upon
one
who
was
able
she
thought
of
herself
and
her
late
resolution
to
serve
him
she
was
in
the
same
mind
still
she
could
not
call
herself
a
christian
yet
but
she
was
resolved
to
be
one
and
she
earnestly
asked
the
saviour
she
sought
to
make
her
and
keep
her
his
child
and
then
ellen
felt
happy
quiet
and
weariness
and
even
drowsiness
succeeded
it
was
well
the
night
was
still
for
it
had
grown
quite
cool
and
a
breeze
would
have
gone
through
and
through
ellen
nankeen
coat
as
it
was
she
began
to
be
chilly
when
van
brunt
who
since
he
had
got
into
the
cart
had
made
no
remarks
except
to
his
oxen
turned
round
a
little
and
spoke
to
her
again
it
only
a
little
bit
of
way
we
got
to
go
now
said
he
turning
the
corner
the
words
seemed
to
shoot
through
ellen
heart
she
was
wide
awake
instantly
and
quite
warm
and
leaning
forward
in
her
little
chair
she
strove
to
pierce
the
darkness
on
either
hand
of
her
to
see
whereabouts
the
house
stood
and
how
things
looked
she
could
discern
nothing
but
misty
shadows
and
outlines
of
she
could
not
tell
what
the
starlight
was
too
dim
to
reveal
anything
to
a
stranger
there
the
house
said
van
brunt
after
a
few
minutes
more
do
you
see
it
yonder
ellen
strained
her
eyes
but
could
make
out
nothing
not
even
a
glimpse
of
white
she
sat
back
in
her
chair
her
heart
beating
violently
presently
van
brunt
jumped
down
and
opened
a
gate
at
the
side
of
the
road
and
with
a
great
deal
of
gee
the
oxen
turned
to
the
right
and
drew
the
cart
a
little
way
uphill
then
stopped
on
what
seemed
level
ground
here
we
are
cried
van
brunt
as
he
threw
his
whip
on
the
ground
and
late
enough
you
must
be
tired
of
that
little
by
this
time
come
to
the
side
of
the
cart
and
i
lift
you
down
poor
ellen
there
was
no
help
for
it
she
came
to
the
side
of
the
cart
and
taking
her
in
his
arms
her
rough
charioteer
set
her
very
gently
and
carefully
on
the
ground
there
said
he
now
you
can
run
right
in
do
you
see
that
little
gate
no
said
ellen
i
ca
see
anything
well
come
here
said
he
and
i
show
you
here
you
running
agin
the
fence
this
way
and
he
opened
a
little
wicket
which
ellen
managed
to
stumble
through
now
said
he
go
straight
up
to
that
door
yonder
and
open
it
and
you
see
where
to
go
do
knock
but
just
pull
the
latch
and
go
in
and
he
went
off
to
his
oxen
ellen
at
first
saw
no
door
and
did
not
even
know
where
to
look
for
it
by
degrees
as
her
head
became
clearer
the
large
dark
shadow
of
the
house
stood
before
her
and
a
little
glimmering
light
of
a
path
seemed
to
lead
onward
from
where
she
stood
with
unsteady
steps
ellen
pursued
it
till
her
foot
struck
against
the
stone
before
the
door
her
trembling
fingers
found
the
latch
lifted
it
and
she
entered
all
was
dark
but
at
the
right
a
window
showed
light
glimmering
within
ellen
made
toward
it
and
groping
came
to
another
this
was
big
and
clumsy
however
she
managed
it
and
pushing
open
the
heavy
door
went
in
it
was
a
kitchen
a
fine
fire
was
burning
in
the
enormous
fireplace
the
white
walls
and
ceiling
were
yellow
in
the
light
of
the
flame
no
candles
were
needed
and
none
were
there
the
supper
table
was
set
and
with
its
tablecloth
and
shining
furniture
looked
very
comfortable
indeed
but
the
only
person
there
was
an
old
woman
sitting
by
the
side
of
the
fire
with
her
back
towards
ellen
she
seemed
to
be
knitting
but
did
not
move
nor
look
round
ellen
had
come
a
step
or
two
into
the
room
and
there
she
stood
unable
to
speak
or
to
go
any
further
can
that
be
aunt
fortune
she
thought
she
ca
be
as
old
as
that
in
another
minute
a
door
opened
at
her
right
just
behind
the
old
woman
back
and
a
second
figure
appeared
at
the
top
of
a
flight
of
stairs
which
led
down
from
the
kitchen
she
came
in
shutting
the
door
behind
her
with
her
foot
and
indeed
both
hands
were
full
one
holding
a
lamp
and
a
knife
and
the
other
a
plate
of
butter
the
sight
of
ellen
stopped
her
short
what
is
this
and
what
do
you
leave
the
door
open
for
child
she
said
she
advanced
towards
it
plate
and
lamp
in
hand
and
setting
her
back
against
the
door
shut
it
vigorously
who
are
you
and
what

ellen
timidly
said
the
lady
with
some
emphasis

ellen

he

ellen

said
miss
fortune
apparently
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
it
must
be

said
ellen
miss
fortune
went
to
the
table
and
put
the
butter
and
the
lamp
in
their
places

you
say

to
tell

flushed
and
her
heart

stood
motionless

ellen
van

then
he

he
and
hearing
at
that
instant
a
noise
outside
miss

swept
to
the
door
saying
as
she
opened
it

take
off
your
things
the
first
command
at
least
ellen
obeyed
gladly
she
did
not
feel
enough
at
home
to
comply
with
the
second
she
only
took
off
her
bonnet
well
van

said
miss

said
miss
fortune
in
a
tone
of
indignant
housewifery
well
without
my
shoes
then
said
van

with
a
half
giggle
as
ellen
heard
the
shoes
kicked
off
now
out
of
my
way

me
a
road
miss
fortune
seized
the
lamp
and
opening
another
door
ushered
van
brunt
and
the
trunk
out
of
the
kitchen
and
up
ellen
saw
not
whither
in
a
minute
or
two
they
returned
and
he

the

him

said
the
blacksmith

kept
him
miss

bustled
about
a
few
minutes
in
silence
setting
some
things
on
the
table
and
filling
the
teapot
come
she
said
to
ellen
take
off
your
coat
and
come
to
the
table
you
must
be
hungry
by
this
time
it
a
good
while
since
you
had
your
dinner
ai
it
come
mother
the
old
lady
rose
and
miss
fortune
taking
her
chair
set
it
by
the
side
of
the
table
next
the
fire
ellen
was
opposite
to
her
and
now
for
the
first
time
the
old
lady
seemed
to
know
that
she
was
in
the
room
she
looked
at
her
very
attentively
but
with
an
expressionless
gaze
which
ellen
did
not
like
to
meet
though
otherwise
her
face
was
calm
and
pleasant
who
is
that
inquired
the
old
lady
presently
of
miss
fortune
in
a
half
whisper
that
morgan
daughter
was
the
answer
morgan
daughter
has
morgan
a
daughter
why
yes
mother
do
you
remember
i
told
you
a
month
ago
he
was
going
to
send
her
here
the
old
lady
turned
again
with
a
half
shake
of
her
head
towards
ellen
morgan
daughter
she
repeated
to
herself
softly
she
a
pretty
little
girl
very
pretty
will
you
come
round
here
and
give
me
a
kiss
dear
ellen
submitted
the
old
lady
folded
her
in
her
arms
and
kissed
her
affectionately
that
your
grandmother
ellen
said
miss
fortune
as
ellen
went
back
to
her
seat
ellen
had
no
words
to
answer
her
aunt
saw
her
weary
down
look
and
soon
after
supper
proposed
to
take
her
upstairs
ellen
gladly
followed
her
miss
fortune
showed
her
to
her
room
and
first
asking
if
she
wanted
anything
left
her
to
herself
it
was
a
relief
ellen
heart
had
been
brimful
and
ready
to
run
over
for
some
time
but
the
tears
could
not
come
then
they
did
not
now
till
she
had
undressed
and
laid
her
weary
little
body
on
the
bed
then
they
broke
forth
in
an
agony
she
did
not
kiss
me
she
did
say
she
was
glad
to
see
me
thought
poor
ellen
but
weariness
this
time
was
too
much
for
sorrow
and
disappointment
it
was
but
a
few
minutes
and
ellen
brow
was
calm
again
and
her
eyelids
still
and
with
the
tears
wet
upon
her
cheeks
she
was
fast
asleep
chapter
x
nimble
mischance
that
so
swift
of
foot
shakespeare
the
morning
sun
was
shining
full
and
strong
in
ellen
eyes
when
she
awoke
bewildered
at
the
strangeness
of
everything
around
her
she
raised
herself
on
her
elbow
and
took
a
long
look
at
her
new
home
it
could
not
help
but
seem
cheerful
the
bright
beams
of
sunlight
streaming
in
through
the
windows
lighted
on
the
wall
and
the
old
wainscoting
and
paintless
and
rough
as
they
were
nature
own
gilding
more
than
made
amends
for
their
want
of
comeliness
still
ellen
was
not
much
pleased
with
the
result
of
her
survey
the
room
was
and
perfectly
neat
and
clean
it
had
two
large
windows
opening
to
the
east
through
which
morning
by
morning
the
sun
looked
in
that
was
another
blessing
but
the
floor
was
without
the
sign
of
a
carpet
and
the
bare
boards
looked
to
ellen
very
comfortless
the
walls
were
not
very
smooth
nor
particularly
white
the
doors
and
though
very
neat
and
even
carved
with
some
attempt
at
ornament
had
never
known
the
touch
of
paint
and
had
grown
in
the
course
of
years
to
be
of
a
light
brown
colour
the
room
was
very
bare
of
furniture
too
a
or
stood
between
the
windows
but
it
was
only
a
top
of
pine
board
set
upon
three
very
long
legs
altogether
of
a
most
awkward
and
unhappy
appearance
ellen
thought
and
quite
too
high
for
her
to
use
with
any
comfort
no
glass
hung
over
it
nor
anywhere
else
on
the
north
side
of
the
room
was
a
fireplace
against
the
opposite
wall
stood
ellen
trunk
and
two
chairs
that
was
all
except
the
cot
bed
she
was
lying
on
and
which
had
its
place
opposite
the
windows
the
coverlid
of
that
came
in
for
a
share
of
her
displeasure
being
of
white
and
blue
worsted
mixed
with
cotton
exceedingly
thick
and
heavy
i
wonder
what
sort
of
a
blanket
is
under
it
said
ellen
if
i
can
ever
get
it
off
to
see
pretty
good
but
the
sheets
are
cotton
and
so
is
the
she
was
still
leaning
on
her
elbow
looking
around
her
with
a
rather
discontented
face
when
some
door
being
opened
downstairs
a
great
noise
of
hissing
and
spluttering
came
to
her
ears
and
presently
after
there
stole
to
her
nostrils
a
steaming
odour
of
something
very
savoury
from
the
kitchen
it
said
as
plainly
as
any
that
she
had
better
get
up
so
up
she
jumped
and
set
about
the
business
of
dressing
with
great
alacrity
where
was
the
distress
of
last
night
gone
with
the
darkness
she
had
slept
well
the
bracing
atmosphere
had
restored
strength
and
spirits
and
the
bright
morning
light
made
it
impossible
to
be
dull
or
in
spite
of
the
new
cause
she
thought
she
had
found
she
went
on
quick
with
the
business
of
the
toilet
but
when
it
came
to
the
washing
she
suddenly
discovered
that
there
were
no
conveniences
for
it
in
her
room
no
sign
of
pitcher
or
basin
or
stand
to
hold
them
ellen
was
slightly
dismayed
but
presently
recollected
her
arrival
had
not
been
looked
for
so
soon
and
probably
the
preparations
for
it
had
not
been
completed
so
she
finished
dressing
and
then
set
out
to
find
her
way
to
the
kitchen
on
opening
the
door
there
was
a
little
from
which
the
stairs
descended
just
in
front
of
her
and
at
the
left
hand
another
door
which
she
supposed
must
lead
to
her
aunt
room
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
ellen
found
herself
in
a
large
square
room
or
hall
for
one
of
its
doors
on
the
east
opened
to
the
outer
air
and
was
in
fact
the
front
door
of
the
house
another
ellen
tried
on
the
south
side
it
would
not
open
a
third
under
the
stairs
admitted
her
to
the
kitchen
the
noise
of
hissing
and
spluttering
now
became
quite
violent
and
the
smell
of
the
cooking
to
ellen
fancy
rather
too
strong
to
be
pleasant
before
a
good
fire
stood
miss
fortune
holding
the
end
of
a
very
long
iron
handle
by
which
she
was
kept
in
communication
with
a
flat
vessel
sitting
on
the
fire
in
which
ellen
soon
discovered
all
this
noisy
and
odorous
cooking
was
going
on
a
tall
tin
stood
on
some
coals
in
the
corner
of
the
fireplace
and
another
little
iron
vessel
in
front
also
claimed
a
share
of
miss
fortune
attention
for
she
every
now
and
then
leaned
forward
to
give
a
stir
to
whatever
was
in
it
making
each
time
quite
a
spasmodic
effort
to
do
so
without
quitting
her
hold
of
the
long
handle
ellen
drew
near
and
looked
on
with
great
curiosity
and
not
a
little
appetite
but
miss
fortune
was
far
too
busy
to
give
her
more
than
a
passing
glance
at
length
the
hissing
pan
was
brought
to
the
hearth
for
some
new
arrangement
of
its
contents
and
ellen
seized
the
moment
of
peace
and
quiet
to
say
good
morning
aunt
fortune
miss
fortune
was
crouching
by
the
pan
turning
her
slices
of
pork
how
do
you
do
this
morning
she
answered
without
looking
up
ellen
replied
that
she
felt
a
great
deal
better
slept
warm
did
you
said
miss
fortune
as
she
set
the
pan
back
on
the
fire
and
ellen
could
hardly
answer
quite
warm
when
the
hissing
and
spluttering
began
again
as
loud
as
ever
i
must
wait
thought
ellen
till
this
is
over
before
i
say
what
i
want
to
i
ca
scream
out
to
ask
for
a
basin
and
towel
in
a
few
minutes
the
pan
was
removed
from
the
fire
and
miss
fortune
went
on
to
take
out
the
brown
slices
of
nicely
fried
pork
and
arrange
them
in
a
deep
dish
leaving
a
small
quantity
of
clear
fat
in
the
pan
ellen
who
was
greatly
interested
and
observing
every
step
most
attentively
settled
in
her
own
mind
that
certainly
this
would
be
thrown
away
being
fit
for
nothing
but
the
pigs
but
miss
fortune
did
think
so
for
she
darted
into
some
pantry
close
by
and
returning
with
a
cup
of
cream
in
her
hand
emptied
it
all
into
the
pork
fat
then
she
ran
into
the
pantry
again
for
a
little
round
tin
box
with
a
cover
full
of
holes
and
shaking
this
gently
over
the
pan
a
fine
white
shower
of
flour
fell
upon
the
cream
the
pan
was
then
replaced
on
the
fire
and
stirred
and
to
ellen
astonishment
the
whole
changed
as
if
by
magic
to
a
thick
stiff
white
froth
it
was
not
till
miss
fortune
was
carefully
pouring
this
over
the
fried
slices
in
the
dish
that
ellen
suddenly
recollected
that
breakfast
was
ready
and
she
was
not
aunt
fortune
she
said
timidly
i
have
washed
yet
there
no
basin
in
my
room
miss
fortune
made
no
answer
nor
gave
any
sign
of
hearing
she
went
on
dishing
up
breakfast
ellen
waited
a
few
minutes
will
you
please
to
show
me
where
i
can
wash
myself
yes
said
miss
fortune
suddenly
standing
erect
you
have
to
go
down
to
the
spout
the
spout
said
ellen
what
that
you
know
it
when
you
see
it
i
guess
answered
her
aunt
again
stooping
over
her
preparations
but
in
another
moment
she
arose
and
said
just
open
that
door
there
behind
you
and
go
down
the
stairs
and
out
at
the
door
and
you
see
where
it
is
and
what
it
is
too
ellen
still
lingered
would
you
be
as
good
as
to
give
me
a
towel
she
said
timidly
miss
fortune
dashed
past
her
and
out
of
another
door
whence
she
presently
returned
with
a
clean
towel
which
she
threw
over
ellen
arm
and
then
went
back
to
her
work
opening
the
door
by
which
she
had
first
seen
her
aunt
enter
the
night
before
ellen
went
down
a
steep
flight
of
steps
and
found
herself
in
a
lower
kitchen
intended
for
common
purposes
it
seemed
not
to
be
used
at
all
at
least
there
was
no
fire
there
and
a
feeling
and
smell
instead
that
was
no
wonder
for
beyond
the
fireplace
on
the
left
hand
was
the
opening
to
the
cellar
which
running
under
the
other
part
of
the
house
was
on
a
level
with
this
kitchen
it
had
no
furniture
but
a
table
and
two
chairs
the
thick
heavy
door
stood
open
passing
out
ellen
looked
around
her
for
water
in
what
shape
or
form
it
was
to
present
itself
she
had
no
very
clear
idea
she
soon
spied
a
few
yards
distant
a
little
stream
of
water
pouring
from
the
end
of
a
pipe
or
trough
raised
about
a
foot
and
a
half
from
the
ground
and
a
path
leading
to
it
left
no
doubt
of
its
being
the
spout
but
when
she
had
reached
it
ellen
was
in
no
small
puzzle
as
to
how
she
should
manage
the
water
was
clear
and
bright
and
poured
very
fast
into
a
shallow
wooden
trough
underneath
whence
it
ran
off
into
the
meadow
and
disappeared
but
what
shall
i
do
without
a
basin
thought
ellen
i
ca
catch
any
water
in
my
hands
it
runs
too
fast
if
i
only
could
get
my
face
under
there
that
would
be
fine
very
carefully
and
cautiously
she
tried
it
but
the
continual
spattering
of
the
water
had
made
the
board
on
which
she
stood
so
slippery
that
before
her
face
could
reach
the
stream
she
came
very
near
tumbling
headlong
and
so
taking
more
of
a
cold
bath
than
she
wished
for
so
she
contented
herself
with
the
drops
her
hands
could
bring
to
her
face
a
scanty
supply
but
those
drops
were
deliciously
cold
and
fresh
and
afterwards
she
pleased
herself
with
holding
her
hands
in
the
running
water
till
they
were
red
with
the
cold
on
the
whole
ellen
enjoyed
her
washing
very
much
the
morning
air
came
playing
about
her
its
cool
breath
was
on
her
cheek
with
health
in
its
touch
the
early
sun
was
shining
on
tree
and
meadow
and
hill
the
long
shadows
stretched
over
the
grass
and
the
very
brown
looked
bright
she
thought
it
was
the
loveliest
place
she
ever
had
seen
and
that
sparkling
trickling
water
was
certainly
the
purest
and
sweetest
she
had
ever
tasted
where
could
it
come
from
it
poured
from
a
small
trough
made
of
the
split
trunk
of
a
tree
with
a
little
groove
or
channel
two
inches
wide
hollowed
out
in
it
but
at
the
end
of
one
of
these
troughs
another
lapped
on
and
another
at
the
end
of
that
and
how
many
there
were
ellen
could
not
see
nor
where
the
beginning
of
them
was
ellen
stood
gassing
and
wondering
drinking
in
the
fresh
air
hope
and
spirits
rising
every
minute
when
she
suddenly
recollected
breakfast
she
hurried
in
as
she
expected
her
aunt
was
at
the
table
but
to
her
surprise
and
not
at
all
to
her
gratification
there
was
van
brunt
at
the
other
end
of
it
eating
away
very
much
at
home
indeed
in
silent
dismay
ellen
drew
her
chair
to
the
side
of
the
table
did
you
find
the
spout
asked
miss
fortune
yes
well
how
do
you
like
it
oh
i
like
it
very
much
indeed
said
ellen
i
think
it
is
beautiful
miss
fortune
face
rather
softened
at
this
and
she
gave
ellen
an
abundant
supply
of
all
that
was
on
the
table
her
journey
the
bracing
air
and
her
cool
morning
wash
all
together
had
made
ellen
very
sharp
and
she
did
justice
to
the
breakfast
she
thought
never
was
coffee
so
good
as
this
country
coffee
nor
anything
so
excellent
as
the
brown
bread
and
butter
both
as
sweet
as
bread
and
butter
could
be
neither
was
any
cookery
so
entirely
satisfactory
as
miss
fortune
fried
pork
and
potatoes
yet
her
teaspoon
was
not
silver
her
knife
could
not
boast
of
being
either
sharp
or
bright
and
her
fork
was
certainly
made
for
anything
else
in
the
world
but
comfort
and
convenience
being
of
only
two
prongs
and
those
so
far
apart
that
ellen
had
no
small
difficulty
to
carry
the
potato
safely
from
her
plate
to
her
mouth
it
mattered
nothing
she
was
now
looking
on
the
bright
side
of
things
and
all
this
only
made
her
breakfast
taste
the
sweeter
ellen
rose
from
the
table
when
she
had
finished
and
stood
a
few
minutes
thoughtfully
by
the
fire
aunt
fortune
she
said
at
length
timidly
if
you
no
objection
i
should
like
to
go
and
take
a
good
look
all
about
oh
yes
said
miss
fortune
go
where
you
like
i
give
you
a
week
to
do
what
you
please
with
yourself
thank
you
said
ellen
as
she
ran
off
for
her
bonnet
a
a
long
time
i
suppose
thought
she
i
shall
go
to
school
at
the
end
of
that
returning
quickly
with
her
white
bonnet
ellen
opened
the
heavy
kitchen
door
by
which
she
had
entered
last
night
and
went
out
she
found
herself
in
a
kind
of
long
shed
it
had
very
rough
walls
and
floor
and
overhead
showed
the
brown
beams
and
rafters
two
little
windows
and
a
door
were
on
the
side
all
manner
of
rubbish
lay
there
especially
at
the
farther
end
there
were
scattered
about
and
piled
up
various
boxes
boards
farming
and
garden
tools
old
pieces
of
rope
and
sheepskin
old
iron
a
and
what
not
ellen
did
not
stay
long
to
look
but
went
out
to
find
something
pleasanter
a
few
yards
from
the
shed
door
was
the
little
gate
through
which
she
had
stumbled
in
the
dark
and
outside
of
that
ellen
stood
still
awhile
it
was
a
fair
pleasant
day
and
the
country
scene
she
looked
upon
was
very
pretty
ellen
thought
so
before
her
at
a
little
distance
rose
the
great
gable
end
of
the
barn
and
a
long
row
of
outhouses
stretched
away
from
it
towards
the
left
the
ground
was
strewn
thick
with
chips
and
the
reason
was
not
hard
to
find
for
a
little
way
off
under
an
old
stunted
lay
a
huge
log
well
chipped
on
the
upper
surface
with
the
axe
resting
against
it
and
close
by
were
some
sticks
of
wood
both
chopped
and
unchopped
to
the
right
the
ground
descended
gently
to
a
beautiful
plane
meadow
skirted
on
the
hither
side
by
a
row
of
fine
the
smooth
green
flat
tempted
ellen
to
a
run
but
first
she
looked
to
the
left
there
was
the
garden
she
guessed
for
there
was
a
paling
fence
which
enclosed
a
pretty
large
piece
of
ground
and
between
the
garden
and
the
house
a
green
slope
ran
down
to
the
spout
that
reminded
her
that
she
intended
making
a
journey
of
discovery
up
the
course
of
the
long
trough
no
time
could
be
better
than
now
and
she
ran
down
the
slope
the
trough
was
supported
at
some
height
from
the
ground
by
little
heaps
of
stones
placed
here
and
there
along
its
whole
course
not
far
from
the
spout
it
crossed
a
fence
ellen
must
cross
it
too
to
gain
her
object
and
how
that
could
be
done
was
a
great
question
she
resolved
to
try
however
but
first
she
played
awhile
with
the
water
which
had
great
charms
for
her
she
dammed
up
the
little
channel
with
her
fingers
forcing
the
water
to
flow
over
the
side
of
the
trough
there
was
something
very
pleasant
in
stopping
the
supply
of
the
spout
and
seeing
the
water
trickling
over
where
it
had
no
business
to
go
and
she
did
not
heed
that
some
of
the
drops
took
her
frock
in
their
way
she
stooped
her
lips
to
the
trough
and
drank
of
its
sweet
current
only
for
fun
sake
for
she
was
not
thirsty
finally
she
set
out
to
follow
the
stream
up
to
its
head
but
poor
ellen
had
not
gone
more
than
half
way
towards
the
fence
when
she
all
at
once
plunged
into
the
mire
the
green
grass
growing
there
had
looked
fair
enough
but
there
was
running
water
and
black
mud
under
the
green
grass
she
found
to
her
sorrow
her
shoes
her
stockings
were
full
what
was
to
be
done
now
the
journey
of
discovery
must
be
given
up
she
forgot
to
think
about
where
the
water
came
from
in
the
more
pressing
question
what
will
aunt
fortune
say
and
the
quick
wish
came
that
she
had
her
mother
to
go
to
however
she
got
out
of
the
slough
and
wiping
her
shoes
as
well
as
she
could
on
the
grass
she
hastened
back
to
the
house
the
kitchen
was
all
put
in
order
the
hearth
swept
the
irons
at
the
fire
and
miss
fortune
just
pinning
her
ironing
blanket
on
the
table
well
what
the
matter
she
said
when
she
saw
ellen
face
but
as
her
glance
reached
the
floor
her
brow
darkened
mercy
on
me
she
exclaimed
with
slow
emphasis
what
on
earth
have
you
been
about
where
have
you
been
ellen
explained
well
you
made
a
figure
of
yourself
sit
down
said
her
aunt
shortly
as
she
thrust
a
chair
down
on
the
hearth
before
the
fire
i
should
have
thought
you
have
wit
enough
at
your
age
to
keep
out
of
the
ditch
i
did
see
any
ditch
said
ellen
no
i
suppose
not
said
miss
fortune
who
was
energetically
twitching
off
ellen
shoes
and
stockings
with
her
forefinger
and
thumb
i
suppose
not
you
were
staring
up
at
the
moon
or
stars
i
suppose
it
all
looked
green
and
smooth
said
poor
ellen
one
part
just
like
another
and
the
first
thing
i
knew
i
was
up
to
my
ankles
what
were
you
there
at
all
for
said
miss
fortune
shortly
enough
i
could
see
where
the
water
came
from
and
i
wanted
to
find
out
well
you
found
out
enough
for
one
day
i
hope
just
look
at
those
stockings
you
got
never
a
pair
of
coloured
stockings
that
you
must
go
poking
into
the
mud
with
white
ones
no
do
you
mean
to
say
you
never
wore
any
but
white
ones
at
home
yes
i
never
had
any
others
miss
fortune
thoughts
seemed
too
much
for
speech
from
the
way
in
which
she
jumped
up
and
went
off
without
saying
anything
more
she
presently
came
back
with
an
old
pair
of
grey
socks
which
she
bade
ellen
put
on
as
soon
as
her
feet
were
dry
how
many
of
those
white
stockings
have
you
she
said
mamma
bought
me
pair
of
new
ones
just
before
i
came
away
and
i
had
as
many
as
that
of
old
ones
besides
well
now
go
up
to
your
trunk
and
bring
all
down
to
me
every
pair
of
white
stockings
you
have
got
there
a
pair
of
old
slippers
you
can
put
on
till
your
shoes
are
dry
she
said
flinging
them
to
her
they
are
much
too
big
for
you
they
not
much
too
big
for
the
they
a
great
deal
too
big
for
me
thought
ellen
but
she
said
nothing
she
gathered
all
her
stockings
together
and
brought
them
downstairs
as
her
aunt
had
bidden
her
now
you
may
run
out
to
the
barn
to
van
brunt
you
find
him
there
and
tell
him
i
want
him
to
bring
me
some
white
maple
bark
when
he
comes
home
to
dinner
white
maple
bark
do
you
hear
away
went
ellen
but
in
a
few
minutes
came
back
i
ca
get
in
she
said
what
the
matter
those
great
doors
are
shut
and
i
ca
open
them
i
knocked
but
nobody
came
knock
at
a
barn
door
said
miss
fortune
you
must
go
in
at
the
little
door
at
the
left
and
go
round
he
in
the
lower
the
barn
stood
lower
than
the
level
of
the
from
which
a
little
bridge
led
to
the
great
doorway
of
the
second
floor
passing
down
the
range
of
outhouses
ellen
came
to
the
little
door
her
aunt
had
spoken
of
but
what
in
the
world
should
i
do
if
there
be
cows
inside
there
said
she
to
herself
she
peeped
in
the
was
perfectly
empty
and
cautiously
and
with
many
a
fearful
glance
to
the
right
and
left
lest
some
terrible
horned
animal
should
present
itself
ellen
made
her
way
across
the
and
through
the
littered
thick
with
straw
wet
and
dry
to
the
lower
the
door
of
this
stood
wide
open
ellen
looked
with
wonder
and
pleasure
when
she
got
in
it
was
an
immense
room
the
sides
showed
nothing
but
hay
up
to
the
ceiling
except
here
and
there
an
enormous
upright
post
the
floor
was
perfectly
clean
only
a
few
locks
of
hay
and
grains
of
wheat
scattered
upon
it
and
a
pleasant
sweet
smell
was
there
ellen
could
not
tell
of
what
but
no
van
brunt
she
looked
about
for
him
she
dragged
her
disagreeable
slippers
back
and
forth
over
the
floor
in
vain
hilloa
what
wanting
at
length
cried
a
rough
voice
she
remembered
very
well
but
where
was
the
speaker
on
every
side
to
every
corner
her
eyes
turned
without
finding
him
she
looked
up
at
last
there
was
the
round
face
of
van
brunt
peering
down
at
her
through
a
large
opening
or
in
the
upper
floor
well
said
he
have
you
come
out
here
to
help
me
thrash
wheat
ellen
told
him
what
she
had
come
for
white
maple
bark
well
said
he
in
his
slow
way
i
bring
it
i
wonder
what
in
the
wind
now
so
ellen
wondered
as
she
slowly
went
back
to
the
house
and
yet
more
when
her
aunt
set
her
to
tacking
her
stockings
together
by
two
and
two
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
them
aunt
fortune
she
at
last
ventured
to
say
you
see
when
the
time
comes
may
i
keep
out
one
pair
said
ellen
who
had
a
vague
notion
that
by
some
mysterious
means
her
stockings
were
to
be
prevented
from
ever
looking
white
any
more
no
just
do
as
i
tell
you
van
brunt
came
at
with
the
white
maple
bark
it
was
thrown
forthwith
into
a
brass
kettle
of
water
which
miss
fortune
had
already
hung
over
the
fire
ellen
felt
sure
this
had
something
to
do
with
her
stockings
but
she
could
ask
no
questions
and
as
soon
as
dinner
was
over
she
went
up
to
her
room
it
did
look
pleasant
now
the
brown
and
rough
dingy
walls
had
lost
their
gilding
the
sunshine
was
out
of
it
and
what
was
more
the
sunshine
was
out
of
ellen
heart
too
she
went
to
the
window
and
opened
it
but
there
was
nothing
to
keep
it
open
it
slid
down
again
as
soon
as
she
let
it
go
baffled
and
sad
she
stood
leaning
her
elbows
on
the
looking
out
on
the
that
lay
before
the
door
and
the
little
gate
that
opened
on
the
lake
and
the
smooth
meadow
and
rich
broken
country
beyond
it
was
a
very
fair
and
pleasant
scene
in
the
soft
sunlight
of
the
last
of
october
but
the
charm
of
it
was
gone
for
ellen
it
was
dreary
she
looked
without
caring
to
look
or
knowing
what
she
was
looking
at
she
felt
the
tears
rising
to
her
eyes
and
sick
of
the
window
turned
away
her
eye
fell
on
her
trunk
her
next
thought
was
of
her
desk
inside
of
it
and
suddenly
her
heart
sprang
i
will
write
to
mamma
no
sooner
said
than
done
the
trunk
was
quickly
open
and
hasty
hands
pulled
out
one
thing
after
another
till
the
desk
was
reached
but
what
shall
i
do
thought
she
there
is
a
sign
of
a
table
oh
what
a
place
i
shut
my
trunk
and
put
it
on
that
but
here
are
all
these
things
to
put
back
first
they
were
eagerly
stowed
away
and
then
kneeling
by
the
side
of
the
trunk
with
loving
hands
ellen
opened
her
desk
a
sheet
of
paper
was
drawn
from
her
store
and
properly
placed
before
her
the
pen
dipped
in
the
ink
and
at
first
with
a
hurried
then
with
a
trembling
hand
she
wrote
my
dear
mamma
but
ellen
heart
had
been
swelling
and
swelling
with
every
letter
of
those
three
words
and
scarcely
was
the
last
a
finished
when
the
pen
was
dashed
down
and
flinging
away
from
the
desk
she
threw
herself
on
the
floor
in
a
passion
of
grief
it
seemed
as
if
she
had
her
mother
again
in
her
arms
and
was
clinging
with
a
not
to
be
parted
from
her
and
then
the
feeling
that
she
was
parted
as
much
bitter
sorrow
as
a
little
heart
can
know
was
in
poor
ellen
now
in
her
childish
despair
she
wished
she
could
die
and
almost
thought
she
should
after
a
time
however
though
not
a
short
time
she
rose
from
the
floor
and
went
to
her
writing
again
her
heart
a
little
eased
by
weeping
yet
the
tears
kept
coming
all
the
time
and
she
could
not
quite
keep
her
paper
from
being
blotted
the
first
sheet
was
spoiled
before
she
was
aware
she
took
another
my
dearest
mamma
it
makes
me
so
glad
and
so
sorry
to
write
to
you
that
i
do
know
what
to
do
i
want
to
see
you
so
much
mamma
that
it
seems
to
me
sometimes
as
if
my
heart
would
break
oh
mamma
if
i
could
just
kiss
you
once
more
i
would
give
anything
in
the
whole
world
i
ca
be
happy
as
long
as
you
are
away
and
afraid
i
ca
be
good
either
but
i
will
try
oh
i
will
try
mamma
i
have
so
much
to
say
to
you
that
i
do
know
where
to
begin
i
am
sure
my
paper
will
never
hold
it
all
you
will
want
to
know
about
my
journey
the
first
day
was
on
the
steamboat
you
know
i
should
have
had
a
dreadful
time
that
day
mamma
but
for
something
i
tell
you
about
i
was
sitting
up
on
the
upper
deck
thinking
about
you
and
feeling
very
badly
indeed
when
a
gentleman
came
and
spoke
to
me
and
asked
me
what
was
the
matter
mamma
i
ca
tell
you
how
kind
he
was
to
me
he
kept
me
with
him
the
whole
day
he
took
me
all
over
the
boat
and
showed
me
all
about
a
great
many
things
and
he
talked
to
me
a
great
deal
oh
mamma
how
he
talked
to
me
he
read
in
the
bible
to
me
and
explained
it
and
he
tried
to
make
me
a
christian
and
oh
mamma
when
he
was
talking
to
me
how
i
wanted
to
do
as
he
said
and
i
resolved
i
would
i
did
mamma
and
i
not
forgotten
it
i
will
try
indeed
but
i
am
afraid
it
will
be
very
hard
without
you
or
him
or
anybody
else
to
help
me
you
could
have
been
kinder
yourself
mamma
he
kissed
me
at
night
when
i
bid
him
and
i
was
very
sorry
indeed
i
wish
i
could
see
him
again
mamma
i
will
always
love
that
gentleman
if
i
never
see
him
again
in
the
world
i
wish
there
was
somebody
here
that
i
could
love
but
there
is
not
you
will
want
to
know
what
sort
of
a
person
my
aunt
fortune
is
i
think
she
is
very
or
she
would
be
if
her
nose
was
not
quite
so
sharp
but
mamma
i
tell
you
what
sort
of
a
feeling
i
have
about
her
it
seems
to
me
as
if
she
was
sharp
all
over
i
am
sure
her
eyes
are
as
sharp
as
two
needles
and
she
do
walk
like
other
people
at
least
sometimes
she
makes
queer
little
jerks
and
starts
and
jumps
and
flies
about
like
i
do
know
what
i
am
afraid
it
is
not
right
for
me
to
write
so
about
her
but
may
i
not
tell
you
mamma
there
nobody
else
for
me
to
talk
to
i
ca
like
aunt
fortune
much
yet
and
i
am
sure
she
do
like
me
but
i
will
try
to
make
her
i
have
not
forgotten
what
you
said
to
me
about
that
oh
dear
mamma
i
will
try
to
mind
everything
you
ever
said
to
me
in
your
life
i
am
afraid
you
like
what
i
have
written
about
aunt
fortune
but
indeed
i
have
done
nothing
to
displease
her
and
i
will
try
not
to
if
you
were
only
here
mamma
i
should
say
it
was
the
loveliest
place
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
perhaps
after
all
i
shall
feel
better
and
be
quite
happy
but
oh
mamma
how
glad
i
shall
be
when
i
get
a
letter
from
you
i
shall
begin
to
look
for
it
soon
and
i
think
i
shall
go
out
of
my
wits
with
joy
when
it
comes
i
had
the
funniest
ride
down
here
from
thirlwall
that
you
can
think
how
do
you
guess
i
came
in
a
cart
drawn
by
oxen
they
went
so
slow
we
were
an
age
getting
here
but
i
liked
it
very
much
there
was
a
man
driving
the
oxen
and
he
was
kind
to
me
but
mamma
what
do
you
think
he
eats
at
the
table
i
know
what
you
would
tell
me
you
would
say
i
must
not
mind
trifles
well
i
will
try
not
mamma
oh
darling
mother
i
ca
think
much
of
anything
but
you
i
think
of
you
the
whole
time
who
makes
tea
for
you
now
are
you
better
are
you
going
to
leave
new
york
soon
it
seems
dreadfully
long
since
i
saw
you
i
am
tired
dear
mamma
and
cold
and
it
is
getting
dark
i
must
stop
i
have
a
good
big
room
to
myself
that
is
a
good
thing
i
should
not
like
to
sleep
with
aunt
fortune
dear
mamma
i
wish
i
could
sleep
with
you
once
more
oh
when
will
that
be
again
mamma
your
affectionate
ellen
the
letter
finished
was
carefully
folded
enclosed
and
directed
and
then
with
an
odd
mixture
of
pleasure
and
sadness
ellen
lit
one
of
her
little
wax
matches
as
she
called
them
and
sealed
it
very
nicely
she
looked
at
it
fondly
a
minute
when
all
was
done
thinking
of
the
dear
fingers
that
would
hold
and
open
it
her
next
movement
was
to
sink
her
face
in
her
hands
and
pray
most
earnestly
for
a
blessing
upon
her
mother
and
help
for
herself
poor
ellen
felt
she
needed
it
she
was
afraid
of
lingering
lest
tea
should
be
ready
so
locking
up
her
letter
she
went
downstairs
the
tea
was
ready
miss
fortune
and
van
brunt
were
at
the
table
and
so
was
the
old
lady
whom
ellen
had
not
seen
before
that
day
she
quietly
drew
up
her
chair
to
its
place
well
said
miss
fortune
i
hope
you
feel
better
for
your
long
stay
upstairs
i
do
said
ellen
a
great
deal
better
what
have
you
been
about
i
have
been
writing
writing
what
i
have
been
writing
to
mamma
perhaps
miss
fortune
heard
the
trembling
of
ellen
voice
or
her
sharp
glance
saw
the
lip
quiver
and
eyelid
droop
something
softened
her
she
spoke
in
a
different
tone
asked
ellen
if
her
tea
was
good
took
care
she
had
plenty
of
the
bread
and
butter
and
excellent
cheese
which
was
on
the
table
and
lastly
cut
her
a
large
piece
of
the
pumpkin
pie
van
brunt
too
looked
once
or
twice
at
ellen
face
as
if
he
thought
all
was
not
right
there
he
was
not
so
sharp
as
miss
fortune
but
the
swollen
eyes
and
tear
stains
were
not
quite
lost
upon
him
after
tea
when
van
brunt
was
gone
and
the
tea
things
cleared
away
ellen
had
the
pleasure
of
finding
out
the
mystery
of
the
brass
kettle
and
the
white
maple
bark
the
kettle
now
stood
in
the
chimney
corner
miss
fortune
seating
herself
before
it
threw
in
all
ellen
stockings
except
one
pair
which
she
flung
over
to
her
saying
there
i
care
if
you
keep
that
one
then
tucking
up
her
sleeves
to
the
elbows
she
fished
up
pair
after
pair
out
of
the
kettle
and
wringing
them
out
hung
them
on
chairs
to
dry
but
as
ellen
had
opined
they
were
no
longer
white
but
of
a
fine
slate
colour
she
looked
on
in
silence
too
much
vexed
to
ask
questions
well
how
do
you
like
that
said
miss
fortune
at
length
when
she
had
got
two
or
three
chairs
round
the
fire
pretty
well
hung
with
a
display
of
cotton
legs
i
do
like
it
at
all
said
ellen
well
do
how
many
pair
of
white
stockings
would
you
like
to
drive
into
the
mud
and
let
me
wash
out
every
week
wash
said
ellen
in
surprise
i
did
think
of
doing
it
who
did
you
think
going
to
do
it
there
nothing
in
this
house
but
goes
through
my
hand
i
can
tell
you
and
so
must
you
i
suppose
you
lived
all
your
life
among
people
that
thought
a
great
deal
of
wetting
their
little
finger
but
i
am
not
one
of
i
guess
find
ellen
was
convinced
of
that
already
well
what
are
you
thinking
of
said
miss
fortune
presently
i
thinking
of
my
nice
white
darning
cotton
said
ellen
i
might
just
as
well
not
have
had
it
is
it
wound
or
in
the
skein
in
the
skein
then
just
go
right
up
and
get
it
i
warrant
i
fix
it
so
that
you
have
a
use
for
it
ellen
obeyed
but
musing
rather
uncomfortably
what
else
there
was
of
hers
that
miss
fortune
could
lay
hands
on
she
seemed
in
imagination
to
see
all
her
white
things
turning
brown
she
resolved
she
would
keep
her
trunk
well
locked
up
but
what
if
her
keys
should
be
called
for
she
was
dismissed
to
her
room
soon
after
the
dyeing
business
was
completed
it
was
rather
a
disagreeable
surprise
to
find
her
bed
still
unmade
and
she
did
not
at
all
like
the
notion
that
the
making
of
it
in
future
must
depend
entirely
upon
herself
ellen
had
no
fancy
for
such
handiwork
she
went
to
sleep
in
somewhat
the
same
dissatisfied
mood
with
which
the
day
had
been
begun
displeasure
at
her
coarse
heavy
coverlid
and
cotton
sheets
again
taking
its
place
among
weightier
matters
and
dreamed
of
tying
them
together
into
a
rope
by
which
to
let
herself
down
out
of
the
window
but
when
she
had
got
so
far
ellen
sleep
became
sound
and
the
end
of
the
dream
was
never
known
chapter
xi
downward
and
ever
farther
and
ever
the
brook
beside
and
ever
fresher
murmured
and
ever
clearer
the
tide
longfellow
the
clouds
and
rain
and
cold
winds
kept
ellen
within
doors
for
several
days
this
did
not
better
the
state
of
matters
between
herself
and
her
aunt
shut
up
with
her
in
the
kitchen
from
morning
till
night
with
the
only
variety
of
the
old
lady
company
part
of
the
time
ellen
thought
neither
of
them
improved
upon
acquaintance
perhaps
they
thought
the
same
of
her
she
was
certainly
not
in
her
best
mood
with
nothing
to
do
the
time
hanging
very
heavy
on
her
hands
disappointed
unhappy
frequently
irritated
ellen
became
at
length
very
ready
to
take
offence
and
nowise
disposed
to
pass
it
over
or
smooth
it
away
she
seldom
showed
this
in
words
it
is
true
but
it
rankled
in
her
mind
listless
and
brooding
she
sat
day
after
day
comparing
the
present
with
the
past
wishing
vain
wishes
indulging
bootless
regrets
and
looking
upon
her
aunt
and
grandmother
with
an
eye
of
more
settled
aversion
the
only
other
person
she
saw
was
van
brunt
who
came
in
regularly
to
meals
but
he
never
said
anything
unless
in
answer
to
miss
fortune
questions
and
remarks
about
the
farm
concerns
these
did
not
interest
her
and
she
was
greatly
wearied
with
the
sameness
of
her
life
she
longed
to
go
out
again
but
thursday
and
friday
and
saturday
and
sunday
passed
and
the
weather
still
kept
her
close
prisoner
monday
brought
a
change
but
though
a
cool
drying
wind
blew
all
day
the
ground
was
too
wet
to
venture
out
on
the
evening
of
that
day
as
miss
fortune
was
setting
the
table
for
tea
and
ellen
sitting
before
the
fire
feeling
weary
of
everything
the
kitchen
door
opened
and
a
girl
somewhat
larger
and
older
than
herself
came
in
she
had
a
pitcher
in
her
hand
and
marching
straight
up
to
the
she
said
will
you
let
granny
have
a
little
milk
miss
fortune
i
find
the
cow
i
bring
it
back
you
lost
her
nancy
have
though
said
the
other
she
been
away
these
two
days
why
did
you
go
somewhere
nearer
for
milk
oh
i
do
know
i
guess
is
the
sweetest
said
the
girl
with
a
look
ellen
did
not
understand
miss
fortune
took
the
pitcher
and
went
into
the
pantry
while
she
was
gone
the
two
children
improved
the
time
in
looking
very
hard
at
each
other
ellen
gaze
was
modest
enough
though
it
showed
a
great
deal
of
interest
in
the
new
object
but
the
broad
searching
stare
of
the
other
seemed
intended
to
take
in
all
there
was
of
ellen
from
her
head
to
her
feet
and
keep
it
and
find
out
what
sort
of
a
creature
she
was
at
once
ellen
almost
shrank
from
the
bold
black
eyes
but
they
never
wavered
till
miss
fortune
voice
broke
the
spell
how
your
grandmother
nancy
she
tolerable
thank
you
now
if
you
do
bring
it
back
you
wo
get
any
more
in
a
hurry
said
miss
fortune
as
she
handed
the
pitcher
back
to
the
girl
i
mind
it
said
the
latter
with
a
little
nod
of
her
head
which
seemed
to
say
there
was
no
danger
of
her
forgetting
who
is
that
aunt
fortune
said
ellen
when
she
was
gone
she
is
a
girl
that
lives
up
on
the
mountain
yonder
but
what
her
name
i
had
just
as
lief
you
would
know
her
name
she
ai
a
good
girl
do
you
never
have
anything
to
do
with
her
ellen
was
in
no
mind
to
give
credit
to
all
her
aunt
opinions
and
she
set
this
down
as
in
part
at
least
coming
from
the
next
morning
was
calm
and
fine
and
ellen
spent
nearly
the
whole
of
it
out
of
doors
she
did
not
venture
near
the
ditch
but
in
every
other
direction
she
explored
the
ground
and
examined
what
stood
or
grew
upon
it
as
thoroughly
as
she
dared
towards
noon
she
was
standing
by
the
little
gate
at
the
back
of
the
house
unwilling
to
go
in
but
not
knowing
what
more
to
do
when
van
brunt
came
from
the
lane
with
a
load
of
wood
ellen
watched
the
oxen
toiling
up
the
ascent
and
thought
it
looked
like
very
hard
work
she
was
sorry
for
them
is
that
a
very
heavy
load
she
asked
of
their
driver
as
he
was
throwing
it
down
under
the
heavy
not
a
bit
of
it
it
ai
nothing
at
all
to
they
take
twice
as
much
any
day
with
pleasure
i
should
think
so
said
ellen
they
do
look
as
if
there
was
much
pleasure
about
it
what
makes
them
lean
over
so
against
each
other
when
they
are
coming
up
hill
oh
that
just
a
way
they
got
they
so
fond
of
each
other
i
suppose
perhaps
they
something
particular
to
say
and
want
to
put
their
heads
together
for
the
purpose
no
said
ellen
half
laughing
it
ca
be
that
they
would
take
the
very
hardest
time
for
that
they
would
wait
till
they
got
to
the
top
of
the
hill
but
there
they
stand
just
as
if
they
were
asleep
only
their
eyes
are
open
poor
things
they
not
very
poor
anyhow
said
van
brunt
there
ai
a
finer
yoke
of
oxen
to
be
seen
than
them
are
nor
in
better
condition
he
went
on
throwing
the
wood
out
of
the
cart
and
ellen
stood
looking
at
him
what
you
give
me
if
i
make
you
a
scup
one
of
these
days
said
van
brunt
a
scup
said
ellen

scup

that
name
some
folks

a
swing
a
swing

ellen

i
like

much

very
much
well

ellen
i

very
much
obliged
to
you

well
now

i
make
a
bargain
with
you
i
engage
to
fix
up
a
scup
for
you
if
you
give
me
a
kiss
poor
ellen
was
struck
dumb
the
dutchman
had
taken
a
fancy
to
the
little
stranger
and
really
felt
very
kindly
disposed
towards
her
but
she
neither
knew
nor
at
that
moment
cared
about
that
she
stood
motionless
utterly
astounded
at
this
proposal
and
not
a
little
indignant
but
when
with
a
smile
upon
his
round
face
he
came
near
to
claim
the
kiss
he
no
doubt
thought
himself
sure
of
ellen
shot
from
him
like
an
arrow
from
a
bow
she
rushed
to
the
house
and
bursting
open
the
door
stood
with
flushed
face
and
sparkling
eyes
in
the
presence
of
her
astonished
aunt
what
in
the
world
is
the
matter
exclaimed
that
lady
he
wanted
to
kiss
me
said
ellen
scarce
knowing
whom
she
was
talking
to
and
crimsoning
more
and
more
who
wanted
to
kiss
you
that
man
out
there
what
man
that
man
that
drives
the
oxen
what
van
brunt
and
ellen
never
forgot
the
loud
ha
ha
which
burst
from
miss
fortune
mouth
well
why
did
you
let
him
kiss
you
the
laugh
the
look
the
tone
stung
ellen
to
the
very
quick
in
a
fury
of
passion
she
dashed
away
out
of
the
kitchen
and
up
to
her
own
room
and
there
for
a
while
the
storm
of
anger
drove
over
her
with
such
violence
that
conscience
had
hardly
time
to
whisper
sorrow
came
in
again
as
passion
faded
and
gentler
but
very
bitter
weeping
took
the
place
of
convulsive
sobs
of
rage
and
mortification
and
then
the
whispers
of
conscience
began
to
be
heard
a
little
oh
mamma
mamma
cried
poor
ellen
in
her
heart
how
miserable
i
am
without
you
i
never
can
like
aunt
fortune
it
of
no
use
i
never
can
like
her
i
hope
i
get
to
hate
her
and
that
is
right
i
am
forgetting
all
that
is
good
and
there
nobody
to
put
me
in
mind
oh
mamma
if
i
could
lay
my
head
in
your
lap
for
a
minute
then
came
thoughts
of
her
bible
and
and
the
friend
who
had
given
it
sorrowful
thoughts
they
were
and
at
last
humbled
and
sad
poor
ellen
sought
that
great
friend
she
knew
she
had
displeased
and
prayed
earnestly
to
be
made
a
good
child
she
felt
and
owned
she
was
not
one
now
it
was
long
after
when
ellen
rose
from
her
knees
her
passion
was
all
gone
she
felt
more
gentle
and
pleasant
than
she
had
done
for
days
but
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
resentment
was
not
all
gone
she
still
thought
she
had
cause
to
be
angry
and
she
could
not
think
of
her
aunt
look
and
tone
without
a
thrill
of
painful
feeling
in
a
very
different
mood
however
from
that
in
which
she
had
flown
upstairs
two
or
three
hours
before
she
now
came
softly
down
and
went
out
by
the
front
door
to
avoid
meeting
her
aunt
she
had
visited
that
morning
a
little
brook
which
ran
through
the
meadow
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
it
had
great
charms
for
her
and
now
crossing
the
lane
and
creeping
under
the
fence
she
made
her
way
again
to
its
banks
at
a
particular
spot
where
the
brook
made
one
of
its
sudden
turns
ellen
sat
down
upon
the
grass
and
watched
the
dark
water
whirling
brawling
over
the
stones
hurrying
past
her
with
ever
the
same
soft
pleasant
sound
and
she
was
never
tired
of
it
she
did
not
hear
footsteps
drawing
near
and
it
was
not
till
some
one
was
close
beside
her
and
a
voice
spoke
almost
in
her
ears
that
she
raised
her
startled
eyes
and
saw
the
little
girl
who
had
come
the
evening
before
for
a
pitcher
of
milk
what
are
you
doing
said
the
latter
i
watching
for
fish
said
ellen
watching
for
fish
said
the
other
rather
disdainfully
yes
said
ellen
there
in
that
little
quiet
place
they
come
sometimes
i
seen
two
you
can
look
for
fish
another
time
come
now
and
take
a
walk
with
me
where
said
ellen
oh
you
shall
see
come
i
take
you
all
about
and
show
you
where
people
live
you
been
anywhere
yet
have
you
no
said
ellen
and
i
should
like
dearly
to
go
but
she
hesitated
her
aunt
words
came
to
mind
that
this
was
not
a
good
girl
and
that
she
must
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
but
she
had
not
more
than
half
believed
them
and
she
could
not
possibly
bring
herself
now
to
go
in
and
ask
miss
fortune
leave
to
take
this
walk
i
am
sure
thought
ellen
she
would
refuse
me
if
there
was
no
reason
in
the
world
and
then
the
delight
of
rambling
through
the
beautiful
country
and
being
for
awhile
in
other
company
than
that
of
her
aunt
fortune
and
the
old
grandmother
the
temptation
was
too
great
to
be
withstood
well
what
are
you
thinking
about
said
the
girl
what
the
matter
wo
you
come
yes
said
ellen
i
ready
which
way
shall
we
go
with
the
assurance
from
the
other
that
she
would
show
her
plenty
of
ways
they
set
off
down
the
lane
ellen
with
a
secret
fear
of
being
seen
and
called
back
till
they
had
gone
some
distance
and
the
house
was
hid
from
view
then
her
pleasure
became
great
the
afternoon
was
fair
and
mild
the
footing
pleasant
and
ellen
felt
like
a
bird
out
of
a
cage
she
was
ready
to
be
delighted
with
every
trifle
her
companion
could
not
by
any
means
understand
or
enter
into
her
bursts
of
pleasure
at
many
a
little
thing
which
she
of
the
black
eyes
thought
not
worthy
of
notice
she
tried
to
bring
ellen
back
to
higher
subjects
of
conversation
how
long
have
you
been
here
she
asked
oh
a
good
while
said
ellen
i
do
know
exactly
it
a
week
i
believe
why
do
you
call
that
a
good
while
said
the
other
well
it
seems
a
good
while
to
me
said
ellen
sighing
it
seems
as
long
as
four
i
am
sure
then
you
do
like
to
live
here
much
do
you
i
had
rather
be
at
home
of
course
how
do
you
like
your
aunt
fortune
how
do
i
like
her
said
ellen
hesitating
i
think
and
very
smart
yes
you
need
tell
me
she
smart
everybody
knows
that
that
what
i
ask
you
how
do
you
her
how
do
i
like
her
said
ellen
again
how
can
i
tell
how
i
shall
like
her
i
have
lived
with
her
but
a
week
yet
you
might
just
as
well
ha
spoke
out
said
the
other
somewhat
scornfully
do
you
think
i
do
know
you
half
hate
her
already
and
it
be
whole
hating
in
another
week
more
when
i
first
heard
come
i
guessed
you
have
a
sweet
time
with
her
why
said
ellen
oh
do
ask
me
why
said
the
other
impatiently
when
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
every
soul
that
speaks
of
you
says
child
and
glad
i
ai
her
you
need
try
to
come
cunning
over
me
i
shall
be
too
much
for
you
i
tell
you
i
do
know
what
you
mean
said
ellen
oh
no
i
suppose
you
do
said
the
other
in
the
same
tone
of
course
you
do
i
suppose
you
do
know
whether
your
tongue
is
your
own
or
somebody
else
you
think
miss
fortune
is
an
angel
and
so
do
i
to
be
sure
she
is
not
very
well
pleased
with
this
kind
of
talk
ellen
walked
on
for
a
while
in
grave
silence
her
companion
meantime
recollected
herself
when
she
spoke
again
it
was
with
an
altered
tone
how
do
you
like
van
brunt
i
do
like
him
at
all
said
ellen
reddening
do
you
said
the
other
surprised
why
everybody
likes
him
what
do
you
like
him
for
i
do
like
him
repeated
ellen
ai
miss
fortune
queer
to
live
in
the
way
she
does
what
way
said
ellen
why
without
any
help
doing
all
her
own
work
and
living
all
alone
when
she
so
rich
as
she
is
is
she
rich
asked
ellen
rich
i
guess
she
is
she
one
of
the
very
best
farms
in
the
country
and
money
enough
to
have
a
dozen
help
if
she
wanted
van
brunt
takes
care
of
the
farm
you
know
does
he
said
ellen
why
yes
of
course
he
does
did
you
know
that
what
did
you
think
he
was
at
your
house
all
the
time
for
i
am
sure
i
do
know
said
ellen
and
are
those
aunt
fortune
oxen
that
he
drives
to
be
sure
they
are
well
i
do
think
you
green
to
have
been
there
all
this
time
and
not
found
that
out
van
brunt
does
just
what
he
pleases
over
the
whole
farm
though
hires
what
help
he
wants
manages
everything
and
then
he
has
his
share
of
all
that
comes
off
it
i
tell
you
what
you
better
make
friends
with
van
brunt
for
if
anybody
can
help
you
when
your
aunt
gets
one
of
her
ugly
fits
it
him
she
do
care
to
meddle
with
him
much
leaving
the
lane
the
two
girls
took
a
footpath
leading
across
the
fields
the
stranger
was
greatly
amused
with
ellen
awkwardness
in
climbing
fences
where
it
was
a
possible
thing
she
was
fain
to
crawl
under
but
once
or
twice
that
could
not
be
done
and
having
with
infinite
difficulty
mounted
to
the
top
rail
poor
ellen
sat
there
in
a
most
tottering
condition
uncertain
on
which
side
of
the
fence
she
should
tumble
over
but
seeing
no
other
possible
way
of
getting
down
the
more
she
trembled
the
more
her
companion
laughed
standing
aloof
meanwhile
and
insisting
she
should
get
down
by
herself
necessity
enabled
her
to
do
this
at
last
and
each
time
the
task
became
easier
but
ellen
secretly
made
up
her
mind
that
her
new
friend
was
not
likely
to
prove
a
very
good
one
as
they
went
along
she
pointed
out
to
ellen
two
or
three
houses
in
the
distance
and
gave
her
not
a
little
gossip
about
the
people
who
lived
in
them
but
all
this
ellen
scarcely
heard
and
cared
nothing
at
all
about
she
had
paused
by
the
side
of
a
large
rock
standing
alone
by
the
wayside
and
was
looking
very
closely
at
its
surface
what
is
this
curious
brown
stuff
said
ellen
growing
all
over
the
rock
like
shrivelled
and
leaves
is
it
curious
part
of
it
stands
out
like
a
leaf
and
part
of
it
sticks
fast
i
wonder
if
it
grows
here
or
what
it
is
oh
never
mind
said
the
other
it
always
grows
on
the
rocks
everywhere
i
do
know
what
it
is
and
what
more
i
do
care
worth
looking
at
come
ellen
followed
her
but
presently
the
path
entered
an
open
woodland
and
now
her
delight
broke
forth
beyond
bounds
oh
how
pleasant
this
is
how
lovely
this
is
is
it
beautiful
she
exclaimed
is
beautiful
i
do
think
you
are
the
queerest
girl
ellen
why
everything
said
ellen
not
minding
the
latter
part
of
the
sentence
the
ground
is
beautiful
and
those
tall
trees
and
that
beautiful
blue
sky
only
look
at
it
the
ground
is
all
covered
with
stones
and
rocks
is
that
what
you
call
beautiful
and
the
trees
are
as
homely
as
they
can
be
with
their
great
brown
stems
and
no
leaves
come
what
you
staring
at
ellen
eyes
were
fixed
on
a
string
of
dark
spots
which
were
rapidly
passing
overhead
hark
said
she
do
you
hear
that
noise
what
is
that
what
is
that
is
it
only
a
flock
of
ducks
said
the
other
contemptuously
come
do
come
but
ellen
was
rooted
to
the
ground
and
her
eyes
followed
the
airy
travellers
till
the
last
one
had
quitted
the
piece
of
blue
sky
which
the
surrounding
woods
left
to
be
seen
and
scarcely
were
these
gone
when
a
second
flight
came
in
view
following
exactly
in
the
track
of
the
first
where
are
they
going
said
ellen
i
am
sure
i
do
know
where
they
are
going
they
never
told
me
i
know
where
am
going
i
should
like
to
know
whether
you
are
going
along
with
me
ellen
however
was
in
no
hurry
the
ducks
had
disappeared
but
her
eye
had
caught
something
else
that
charmed
it
what
is
this
said
ellen
nothing
but
moss
is
that
moss
how
beautiful
how
green
and
soft
it
is
i
declare
as
soft
as
a
carpet
as
soft
as
a
carpet
repeated
the
other
i
should
like
to
see
a
carpet
as
soft
as
that
never
did
i
guess
indeed
i
have
though
said
ellen
who
was
gently
jumping
up
and
down
on
the
green
moss
to
try
its
softness
with
a
face
of
great
satisfaction
i
do
believe
it
a
bit
said
the
other
all
the
carpets
i
ever
saw
were
as
hard
as
a
board
and
harder
as
soft
as
that
indeed
well
said
ellen
still
jumping
up
and
down
with
bonnet
off
and
glowing
cheek
and
hair
dancing
about
her
face
you
may
believe
what
you
like
but
i
seen
a
carpet
as
soft
as
this
and
softer
too
only
one
though
what
was
it
made
of
what
other
carpets
are
made
of
i
suppose
come
i
go
with
you
now
i
do
think
this
is
the
loveliest
place
i
ever
did
see
are
there
any
flowers
here
in
the
spring
i
do
know
yes
lots
of
pretty
ones
said
ellen
think
so
i
suppose
i
never
look
at
oh
how
lovely
that
will
be
said
ellen
clasping
her
hands
how
pleasant
it
must
be
to
live
in
the
country
pleasant
indeed
said
the
other
i
think
it
hateful
you
think
so
too
if
you
lived
where
i
do
it
makes
me
mad
at
granny
every
day
because
she
wo
go
to
thirlwall
wait
till
we
get
out
of
the
wood
and
i
show
you
where
i
live
you
ca
see
it
from
here
shocked
a
little
at
her
companion
language
ellen
again
walked
on
in
sober
silence
gradually
the
ground
became
more
broken
sinking
rapidly
from
the
side
of
the
path
and
rising
again
in
a
steep
bank
on
the
other
side
of
a
narrow
dell
both
sides
were
thickly
wooded
but
stripped
of
green
now
except
where
here
and
there
a
hemlock
flung
its
graceful
branches
abroad
and
stood
in
lonely
beauty
among
its
leafless
companions
now
the
gurgling
of
waters
was
heard
where
is
that
said
ellen
stopping
short
down
down
at
the
bottom
there
it
the
brook
what
brook
not
the
same
that
goes
by
aunt
fortune
yes
it
the
very
same
it
the
crookedest
thing
you
ever
saw
it
runs
over
there
said
the
speaker
pointing
with
her
arm
and
then
it
takes
a
turn
and
goes
that
way
and
then
it
comes
round
so
and
then
it
shoots
off
in
that
way
again
and
passes
by
your
house
and
after
that
the
dear
knows
where
it
goes
for
i
do
but
i
do
suppose
it
could
run
straight
if
it
was
to
try
to
ca
we
get
down
to
it
asked
ellen
to
be
sure
we
can
unless
you
as
afraid
of
steep
banks
as
you
are
of
fences
very
steep
indeed
it
was
and
strewn
with
loose
stones
but
ellen
did
not
falter
here
and
though
once
or
twice
in
imminent
danger
of
exchanging
her
cautious
stepping
for
one
long
roll
to
the
bottom
she
got
there
safely
on
her
two
feet
when
there
everything
was
forgotten
in
delight
it
was
a
wild
little
place
the
high
close
sides
of
the
dell
left
only
a
little
strip
of
sky
overhead
and
at
their
feet
ran
the
brook
much
more
noisy
and
lively
here
than
where
ellen
had
before
made
its
acquaintance
leaping
from
rock
to
rock
eddying
round
large
stones
and
boiling
over
the
small
ones
and
now
and
then
pouring
quietly
over
some
great
trunk
of
a
tree
that
had
fallen
across
its
bed
and
dammed
up
the
whole
stream
ellen
could
scarcely
contain
herself
at
the
magnificence
of
many
of
the
waterfalls
the
beauty
of
the
little
quiet
pools
where
the
water
lay
still
behind
some
large
stone
and
the
variety
of
graceful
tiny
cascades
look
here
nancy
cried
ellen
that
the
falls
of
niagara
do
you
see
that
large
one
oh
that
is
splendid
and
this
will
do
for
trenton
falls
what
a
fine
foam
it
makes
is
it
a
beauty
and
what
shall
we
call
this
i
do
know
what
to
call
it
i
wish
we
could
name
them
all
but
there
no
end
to
them
oh
just
look
at
that
one
that
too
pretty
not
to
have
a
name
what
shall
it
be
black
falls
suggested
the
other
black
said
ellen
dubiously
why
i
do
like
that
why
the
water
all
dark
and
black
do
you
see
well
said
ellen
let
it
be
black
then
but
i
do
like
it
now
remember
this
is
niagara
that
is
black
and
this
is
trenton
and
what
is
this
if
you
are
to
name
them
all
said
nancy
we
get
home
you
might
as
well
name
all
the
trees
there
a
hundred
of
and
more
i
say
ellen
we
follow
the
brook
instead
of
climbing
up
yonder
again
it
will
take
us
out
to
the
open
fields
oh
do
let
said
ellen
that
will
be
lovely
it
proved
a
rough
way
but
ellen
still
thought
and
called
it
lovely
often
by
the
side
of
the
stream
there
was
no
footing
at
all
and
the
girls
picked
their
way
over
the
stones
large
and
small
wet
and
dry
which
strewed
its
bed
against
which
the
water
foamed
and
fumed
and
fretted
as
if
in
great
impatience
it
was
ticklish
work
getting
along
over
these
stones
now
tottering
on
an
unsteady
one
now
slipping
on
a
wet
one
and
every
now
and
then
making
huge
leaps
from
rock
to
rock
which
there
was
no
other
method
of
reaching
at
the
imminent
hazard
of
falling
in
but
they
laughed
at
the
danger
sprang
on
in
great
glee
delighted
with
the
exercise
and
the
fun
did
stay
long
enough
anywhere
to
lose
their
balance
and
enjoyed
themselves
amazingly
there
was
many
a
hairbreadth
escape
many
an
sousing
but
that
made
it
all
the
more
lively
the
brook
formed
as
nancy
had
said
a
constant
succession
of
little
waterfalls
its
course
being
quite
steep
and
very
rocky
and
in
some
places
there
were
pools
quite
deep
enough
to
have
given
them
a
thorough
wetting
to
say
no
more
if
they
had
missed
their
footing
and
tumbled
in
but
this
did
not
happen
in
due
time
though
with
no
little
difficulty
they
reached
the
spot
where
the
brook
came
forth
from
the
wood
into
the
open
day
and
thence
making
a
sharp
turn
to
the
right
skirted
along
by
the
edge
of
the
trees
as
if
unwilling
to
part
company
with
them
i
guess
we
better
get
back
into
the
lane
now
said
miss
nancy
we
a
pretty
good
long
way
from
home
chapter
xii
behind
the
door
stand
bags
o
meal
and
in
the
ark
is
plenty
and
good
hard
cakes
his
mither
makes
and
mony
a
sweeter
dainty
a
good
fat
sow
a
sleeky
cow
are
standing
in
the
byre
while
winking
puss
wi
mealy
mou
is
playing
round
the
fire
scotch
song
they
left
the
wood
and
the
brook
behind
them
and
crossed
a
large
stubble
field
then
got
over
a
fence
into
another
they
were
in
the
midst
of
this
when
nancy
stopped
ellen
and
bade
her
look
up
towards
the
west
where
towered
a
high
mountain
no
longer
hid
from
their
view
by
the
trees
i
told
you
i
show
you
where
i
live
said
she
look
up
now
clear
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
almost
and
a
little
to
the
right
do
you
see
that
little
mite
of
a
house
there
look
sharp
it
as
brown
as
the
rock
do
you
see
it
it
close
by
that
big
but
it
do
look
big
from
here
it
just
by
that
little
dark
spot
near
the
top
i
see
it
said
ellen
i
see
it
now
do
you
live
up
there
that
just
what
i
do
and
that
just
what
i
wish
i
did
but
granny
likes
it
she
will
live
there
i
blessed
if
i
know
what
for
if
it
ai
to
plague
me
do
you
think
you
like
to
live
up
on
the
top
of
a
mountain
like
that
no
i
do
think
i
should
said
ellen
is
it
very
cold
up
there
cold
you
do
know
anything
about
it
the
wind
comes
there
i
tell
you
enough
to
cut
you
in
two
i
have
to
take
and
hold
on
to
the
trees
sometimes
to
keep
from
being
blowed
away
and
then
granny
sends
me
out
every
morning
before
it
light
no
matter
how
deep
the
snow
is
to
look
for
the
cow
and
it
so
bitter
cold
i
expect
nothing
else
but
i
be
froze
to
death
some
time
oh
said
ellen
with
a
look
of
horror
how
can
she
do
so
oh
she
do
care
said
the
other
she
sees
my
nose
freeze
off
every
winter
and
it
do
make
no
difference
freeze
your
nose
off
said
ellen
to
be
sure
said
the
other
nodding
gravely
every
winter
it
grows
out
again
when
the
warm
weather
comes
and
is
that
the
reason
why
it
is
so
little
said
ellen
innocently
and
with
great
curiosity
little
said
the
other
crimsoning
in
a
fury
what
do
you
mean
by
that
it
as
big
as
yours
any
day
i
can
tell
you
ellen
involuntarily
put
her
hand
to
her
face
to
see
if
nancy
spoke
true
somewhat
reassured
to
find
a
very
decided
ridge
where
her
nose
was
wanting
in
the
line
of
beauty
she
answered
in
her
turn
it
no
such
thing
nancy
you
ought
to
say
so
you
know
better
i
know
better
i
to
say
so
replied
the
other
furiously
if
i
had
your
nose
i
be
glad
to
have
it
freeze
off
i
a
sight
rather
have
none
i
pull
it
every
day
if
i
was
you
to
make
it
grow
i
shall
believe
what
aunt
fortune
said
of
you
was
true
said
ellen
she
had
coloured
very
high
but
she
added
no
more
and
walked
on
in
dignified
silence
nancy
stalked
before
her
in
silence
that
was
meant
to
be
dignified
too
though
it
had
not
exactly
that
air
by
degrees
each
cooled
down
and
nancy
was
trying
to
find
out
what
miss
fortune
had
said
of
her
when
on
the
edge
of
the
next
field
they
met
the
brook
again
after
running
a
long
way
to
the
right
it
had
swept
round
and
here
was
flowing
gently
in
the
opposite
direction
but
how
were
they
ever
to
cross
it
the
brook
ran
in
a
smooth
current
between
them
and
a
rising
bank
on
the
other
side
so
high
as
to
prevent
their
seeing
what
lay
beyond
there
were
no
now
the
only
thing
that
looked
like
a
bridge
was
an
old
log
that
had
fallen
across
the
brook
or
perhaps
had
at
some
time
or
other
been
put
there
on
purpose
and
that
lay
more
than
half
in
the
water
what
remained
of
its
surface
was
green
with
moss
and
slippery
with
slime
ellen
was
sadly
afraid
to
trust
herself
on
it
but
what
to
do
nancy
soon
settled
the
question
as
far
as
she
was
concerned
pulling
off
her
thick
shoes
she
ran
fearlessly
upon
the
rude
bridge
her
clinging
bare
feet
carried
her
safely
over
and
ellen
soon
saw
her
herself
in
triumph
on
the
opposite
side
but
thus
left
behind
and
alone
her
own
difficulty
increased
pull
off
your
shoes
and
do
as
i
did
said
nancy
i
ca
said
ellen
i
afraid
of
wetting
my
feet
i
know
mamma
would
let
me
afraid
of
wetting
your
feet
said
the
other
what
a
chickaninny
you
are
well
if
you
try
to
come
over
with
your
shoes
on
you
fall
in
i
tell
you
and
then
you
wet
more
than
your
feet
but
come
along
somehow
for
i
wo
stand
here
waiting
much
longer
thus
urged
ellen
set
out
upon
her
perilous
journey
over
the
bridge
slowly
and
fearfully
and
with
as
much
care
as
possible
she
set
step
by
step
upon
the
slippery
log
already
half
of
the
danger
was
passed
when
reaching
forward
to
grasp
nancy
outstretched
hand
she
missed
it
that
was
nancy
fault
poor
ellen
lost
her
balance
and
went
in
head
foremost
the
water
was
deep
enough
to
cover
her
completely
as
she
lay
though
not
enough
to
prevent
her
getting
up
again
she
was
greatly
frightened
but
managed
to
struggle
up
first
to
a
sitting
posture
and
then
to
her
feet
and
then
to
wade
out
to
the
shore
though
dizzy
and
sick
she
came
nearly
falling
back
again
more
than
once
the
water
was
very
cold
and
thoroughly
sobered
poor
ellen
felt
chill
enough
in
body
and
mind
too
all
her
fine
spirits
were
gone
and
not
the
less
because
nancy
had
risen
to
a
great
pitch
of
delight
at
her
misfortune
the
air
rang
with
her
laughter
she
likened
ellen
to
every
ridiculous
thing
she
could
think
of
too
miserable
to
be
angry
ellen
could
not
laugh
and
would
not
cry
but
she
exclaimed
in
distress
oh
what
shall
i
do
i
am
so
cold
come
along
said
nancy
give
me
your
hand
we
run
right
over
to
van
brunt
far
it
just
over
here
there
said
she
as
they
got
to
the
top
of
the
bank
and
came
within
sight
of
a
house
standing
only
a
few
fields
off
there
it
is
run
ellen
and
we
be
there
directly
who
is
van
brunt
ellen
contrived
to
say
as
nancy
hurried
her
along
who
is
she
run
ellen
why
she
just
van
brunt
your
van
brunt
mother
you
know
make
haste
ellen
we
had
rain
enough
the
other
day
i
afraid
it
would
be
good
for
the
grass
if
you
stayed
too
long
in
one
place
hurry
i
afraid
you
catch
cold
you
got
your
feet
wet
after
all
i
sure
run
they
did
and
a
few
minutes
brought
them
to
van
brunt
door
the
little
brick
walk
leading
to
it
from
the
courtyard
gate
was
as
neat
as
a
pin
so
was
everything
else
the
eye
could
rest
on
and
when
nancy
went
in
poor
ellen
stayed
foot
at
the
door
unwilling
to
carry
her
wet
shoes
and
dripping
garments
any
further
she
could
hear
however
what
was
going
on
hillo
van
brunt
shouted
nancy
where
are
you
oh
van
brunt
are
you
out
of
water
if
you
are
i
brought
you
a
plenty
the
person
that
has
it
do
want
it
she
just
at
the
door
she
would
bring
it
in
till
she
knew
you
wanted
it
oh
van
brunt
do
look
so
or
you
kill
me
with
laughing
come
and
see
come
and
see
the
steps
within
drew
near
the
door
and
first
nancy
showed
herself
and
then
a
little
old
woman
not
very
old
either
of
very
kind
pleasant
countenance
what
is
all
this
said
she
in
great
surprise
bless
me
poor
little
dear
what
is
this
nothing
in
the
world
but
a
drowned
rat
van
brunt
do
you
see
said
nancy
go
home
nancy
vawse

said
the
old
lady
you
a
regular
bad
girl
i
do
believe
this
is
some
mischief
o
yourn
go
right
off
home
it
time
you
were
after
your
cow
a
great
while
ago
as
she
spoke
she
drew
ellen
in
and
shut
the
door
poor
little
dear
said
the
old
lady
kindly
what
has
happened
to
you
come
to
the
fire
love
you
trembling
with
the
cold
oh
dear
dear
you
soaking
wet
this
is
all
along
of
nancy
somehow
i
know
how
was
it
love
ai
you
miss
fortune
little
girl
never
mind
do
talk
darling
there
ai
one
bit
of
colour
in
your
face
not
one
bit
good
van
brunt
had
drawn
ellen
to
the
fire
and
all
this
while
she
was
pulling
off
as
fast
as
possible
her
wet
clothes
then
sending
a
girl
who
was
in
waiting
for
clean
towels
she
rubbed
ellen
dry
from
head
to
foot
and
wrapping
her
in
a
blanket
left
her
in
a
chair
before
the
fire
while
she
went
to
seek
something
for
her
to
put
on
ellen
had
managed
to
tell
who
she
was
and
how
her
mischance
had
come
about
but
little
else
though
the
kind
old
lady
had
kept
on
pouring
out
words
of
sorrow
and
pity
during
the
whole
time
she
came
trotting
back
directly
with
one
of
her
own
short
gowns
the
only
thing
that
she
could
lay
hands
on
that
was
anywhere
near
ellen
length
enormously
big
it
was
for
her
but
van
brunt
wrapped
it
round
and
round
and
the
blanket
over
it
again
and
then
she
bustled
about
till
she
had
prepared
a
tumbler
of
hot
drink
which
she
said
was
to
keep
ellen
from
catching
cold
it
was
anything
but
agreeable
being
made
from
some
bitter
herb
and
sweetened
with
molasses
but
ellen
swallowed
it
as
she
would
anything
else
at
such
kind
hands
and
the
old
lady
carried
her
herself
into
a
little
room
opening
out
of
the
kitchen
and
laid
her
in
a
bed
that
had
been
warmed
for
her
excessively
tired
and
weak
as
she
was
ellen
scarcely
needed
the
help
of
the
hot
herb
tea
to
fall
into
a
very
deep
sleep
perhaps
it
might
not
have
lasted
so
very
long
as
it
did
but
for
that
afternoon
changed
for
evening
evening
grew
quite
dark
still
ellen
did
not
stir
and
after
every
little
journey
into
the
bedroom
to
see
how
she
was
doing
van
brunt
came
back
saying
how
glad
she
was
to
see
her
sleeping
so
finely
other
eyes
looked
on
for
a
minute
kind
and
gentle
eyes
though
van
brunt
were
kind
and
gentle
too
once
a
soft
kiss
touched
her
forehead
there
was
no
danger
of
waking
her
it
was
perfectly
dark
in
the
little
bedroom
and
had
been
so
a
good
while
when
ellen
was
aroused
by
some
noise
and
then
a
rough
voice
she
knew
very
well
feeling
faint
and
weak
and
not
more
than
half
awake
yet
she
lay
still
and
listened
she
heard
the
outer
door
open
and
shut
and
then
the
voice
said
so
mother
you
got
my
stray
sheep
here
have
you
ay
ay
said
the
voice
of
van
brunt
have
you
been
looking
for
her
how
did
you
know
she
was
here
looking
for
her
ay
looking
for
her
ever
since
sundown
she
has
been
missing
at
the
house
since
some
time
this
forenoon
i
believe
her
aunt
got
a
bit
scared
about
her
anyhow
i
did
she
a
queer
little
chip
as
ever
i
see
she
a
dear
little
soul
know
said
his
mother
you
need
say
nothin
agin
her
i
ai
to
believe
it
no
more
am
i
i
the
best
friend
she
got
if
she
only
knowed
it
but
do
you
think
said
van
brunt
laughing
i
asked
her
to
give
me
a
kiss
this
forenoon
and
if
i
been
an
owl
she
could
ha
been
more
scared
she
went
off
like
a
streak
and
miss
fortune
said
she
was
as
mad
as
she
could
be
and
that
the
last
of
her
how
did
you
find
her
out
i
met
that
mischievous
vawse
girl
and
i
made
her
tell
me
she
had
no
mind
to
at
first
it
be
the
worse
for
ellen
if
she
takes
to
that
wicked
thing
she
wo
nancy
has
been
taking
her
for
a
walk
and
worked
it
so
as
to
get
her
into
the
brook
and
then
she
brought
her
here
just
as
dripping
wet
as
she
could
be
i
gave
her
something
hot
and
put
her
to
bed
and
she
do
i
reckon
but
i
tell
you
it
gave
me
queer
feelings
to
see
the
poor
little
thing
just
as
white
as
ashes
and
all
of
a
tremble
and
looking
so
sorrowful
too
she
sleeping
finely
now
but
it
ai
right
to
see
a
child
face
look
so
it
ai
right
repeated
van
brunt
thoughtfully
you
had
supper
have
you
no
mother
and
i
must
take
that
young
one
back
ai
she
awake
yet
i
see
directly
but
she
ai
going
home
nor
you
neither
till
you
got
your
supper
it
would
be
a
sin
to
let
her
she
shall
have
a
taste
of
my
splitters
this
very
night
i
been
making
them
purpose
for
her
so
you
may
just
take
off
your
hat
and
sit
down
you
mean
to
let
her
know
where
to
come
when
she
wants
good
things
mother
well
i
wo
say
splitters
ai
worth
waiting
for
ellen
heard
him
sit
down
and
then
she
guessed
from
the
words
that
passed
that
van
brunt
and
her
little
maid
were
busied
in
making
the
cakes
she
lay
quiet
you
a
good
friend
began
the
old
lady
again
nobody
knows
that
better
than
me
but
i
hope
that
poor
little
thing
has
got
another
one
that
do
more
for
her
than
you
can
what
yourself
mother
i
do
know
about
that
no
no
do
you
think
i
mean
myself
there
turn
it
quick
sally
miss
alice
has
been
here
how
this
evening
just
a
little
before
dark
on
her
grey
pony
she
came
in
for
a
minute
and
i
took
her
that
burn
sally
i
took
her
in
to
see
the
child
while
she
was
asleep
and
i
told
her
all
you
told
me
about
her
she
did
say
much
but
she
looked
at
her
very
sweet
as
she
always
does
and
i
guess
there
now
i
see
after
my
little
sleeper
and
presently
van
brunt
came
to
the
bedside
with
a
light
and
her
arms
full
of
ellen
dry
clothes
ellen
felt
as
if
she
could
have
put
her
arms
round
her
kind
old
friend
and
hugged
her
with
all
her
heart
but
it
was
not
her
way
to
show
her
feelings
before
strangers
she
suffered
van
brunt
to
dress
her
in
silence
only
saying
with
a
sigh
how
kind
you
are
to
me
to
which
the
old
lady
replied
with
a
kiss
and
telling
her
she
must
say
a
word
about
that
the
kitchen
was
bright
with
firelight
and
candlelight
the
looked
beautiful
with
its
piles
of
white
splitters
besides
plenty
of
other
and
more
substantial
things
and
at
the
corner
of
the
hearth
sat
van
brunt
so
said
he
smiling
as
ellen
came
in
and
took
her
stand
at
the
opposite
corner
so
i
drove
you
away
this
morning
you
ai
mad
with
me
yet
i
hope
ellen
crossed
directly
over
to
him
and
putting
her
little
hand
in
his
great
rough
one
said
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
van
brunt
for
taking
so
much
trouble
to
come
and
look
after
me
she
said
it
with
a
look
of
gratitude
and
trust
that
pleased
him
very
much
trouble
indeed
said
he
i
take
twice
as
much
any
day
for
what
you
would
give
me
this
forenoon
but
never
fear
miss
ellen
i
ai
to
ask
you
that
again
he
shook
the
little
hand
and
from
that
time
ellen
and
her
rough
charioteer
were
firm
friends
van
brunt
now
summoned
them
to
table
and
ellen
was
well
feasted
with
the
splitters
which
were
a
kind
of
rich
baked
in
irons
very
thin
and
crisp
and
then
split
in
two
and
buttered
whence
their
name
a
pleasant
meal
was
that
whatever
an
epicure
might
have
thought
of
the
tea
to
ellen
in
her
famished
state
it
was
delicious
and
no
epicure
could
have
found
fault
with
the
cold
ham
and
the
butter
and
the
cakes
but
far
better
than
all
was
the
spirit
of
kindness
that
was
there
ellen
feasted
on
that
more
than
on
anything
else
if
her
host
and
hostess
were
not
very
polished
they
could
not
have
been
outdone
in
their
kind
care
of
her
and
kind
attention
to
her
wants
and
when
the
supper
was
at
length
over
van
brunt
declared
a
little
colour
had
come
back
to
the
pale
cheeks
the
colour
came
back
in
good
earnest
a
few
minutes
after
when
a
great
cat
walked
into
the
room
ellen
jumped
down
from
her
chair
and
presently
was
bestowing
the
tenderest
caresses
upon
pussy
who
stretched
out
her
head
and
purred
as
if
she
liked
them
very
well
what
a
nice
cat
said
ellen
she
has
five
kittens
said
van
brunt
five
kittens
said
ellen
oh
may
i
come
some
time
and
see
them
you
shall
see
right
away
dear
and
come
as
often
as
you
like
too
sally
just
take
a
basket
and
go
fetch
them
kittens
here
upon
this
van
brunt
began
to
talk
about
its
being
time
to
go
if
they
were
going
but
his
mother
insisted
that
ellen
should
stay
where
she
was
she
said
she
was
not
fit
to
go
home
that
night
that
she
ought
to
walk
a
step
and
that
should
go
and
tell
miss
fortune
the
child
was
safe
and
well
and
would
be
with
her
early
in
the
morning
van
brunt
shook
his
head
two
or
three
times
but
finally
agreed
to
ellen
great
joy
when
he
came
back
she
was
sitting
on
the
floor
before
the
fire
with
all
the
five
kittens
in
her
lap
and
the
old
mother
cat
walking
around
and
over
her
and
them
but
she
looked
up
with
a
happier
face
than
he
had
ever
seen
her
wear
and
told
him
she
was
much
obliged
to
him
for
taking
such
a
long
walk
for
her
and
van
brunt
felt
that
like
his
oxen
he
could
have
done
a
great
deal
more
with
pleasure
chapter
xiii
it
hardly
in
a
body
to
keep
at
times
frae
being
sour
burns
before
the
sun
was
up
the
next
morning
van
brunt
came
into
room
and
aroused
her
it
a
real
shame
to
wake
you
up
she
said
when
you
were
sleeping
so
finely
but
wants
to
be
off
to
his
work
and
wo
stay
for
breakfast
slept
sound
did
you
oh
yes
indeed
as
sound
as
a
top
said
ellen
rubbing
her
eyes
i
am
hardly
awake
yet
i
declare
it
too
bad
said
van
brunt
but
there
no
help
for
it
you
do
feel
no
headache
do
you
nor
pain
in
your
bones
no
not
a
bit
of
it
i
feel
nicely
ah
well
said
van
brunt
then
your
tumble
into
the
brook
do
you
any
mischief
i
thought
it
would
poor
little
soul
i
am
very
glad
i
did
fall
in
said
ellen
for
if
i
had
i
have
come
here
van
brunt
the
old
lady
instantly
kissed
her
oh
may
i
just
take
one
look
at
the
kitties
said
ellen
when
she
was
ready
to
go
indeed
you
shall
said
van
brunt
if
hurry
was
ever
so
much
and
it
ai
besides
come
here
dear
she
took
ellen
back
to
a
waste
where
in
a
corner
on
some
old
pieces
of
carpet
lay
pussy
and
her
family
how
fondly
ellen
hand
was
passed
over
each
little
soft
back
how
hard
it
was
for
her
to
leave
them
would
you
like
to
take
one
home
with
you
dear
said
van
brunt
at
length
oh
may
i
said
ellen
looking
up
in
delight
are
you
in
earnest
oh
thank
you
dear
van
brunt
oh
i
shall
be
so
glad
well
choose
one
then
dear
choose
the
one
you
like
best
and
shall
carry
it
for
you
the
choice
was
made
and
van
brunt
and
ellen
returned
to
the
kitchen
where
van
brunt
had
already
been
waiting
some
time
he
shook
his
head
when
he
saw
what
was
in
the
basket
his
mother
handed
to
him
that
wo
do
said
he
i
ca
do
that
mother
i
undertake
to
see
miss
ellen
safe
home
but
the
cat
be
more
than
i
could
manage
i
think
i
hardly
get
off
with
a
whole
skin
the
one
and
well
now
said
van
brunt
ellen
gave
a
longing
look
at
her
favourite
which
was
uneasily
endeavouring
to
find
out
the
height
of
the
basket
and
mewing
at
the
same
time
with
a
most
ungratified
expression
however
though
sadly
disappointed
she
submitted
with
a
very
good
grace
to
what
could
not
be
helped
first
setting
down
the
little
cat
out
of
the
basket
it
seemed
to
like
so
ill
and
giving
it
one
farewell
pat
and
squeeze
she
turned
to
the
kind
old
lady
who
stood
watching
her
and
throwing
her
arms
around
her
neck
silently
spoke
her
gratitude
in
a
hearty
hug
and
kiss
said
she
i
may
come
and
see
them
some
time
again
and
see
you
may
i
indeed
you
shall
my
darling
said
the
old
woman
just
as
often
as
you
like
just
as
often
as
you
can
get
away
i
make
bring
you
home
sometimes
you
bring
her
wo
you
there
two
words
to
that
bargain
mother
i
can
tell
you
but
if
i
do
i
know
the
reason
o
and
away
they
went
ellen
drew
two
or
three
sighs
at
first
but
she
could
not
help
brightening
up
soon
it
was
early
not
sunrise
the
cool
freshness
of
the
air
was
enough
to
give
one
new
life
and
spirit
the
sky
was
fair
and
bright
and
van
brunt
marched
along
at
a
quick
pace
enlivened
by
the
exercise
ellen
speedily
forgot
everything
disagreeable
and
her
little
head
was
filled
with
pleasant
things
she
watched
where
the
silver
light
in
the
east
foretold
the
sun
coming
she
watched
the
silver
changed
to
gold
till
a
rich
yellow
tint
was
flung
over
the
whole
landscape
and
then
broke
the
first
rays
of
light
upon
the
tops
of
the
western
hills
the
sun
was
up
it
was
a
new
sight
to
ellen
how
beautiful
oh
how
beautiful
she
exclaimed
yes
said
van
brunt
in
his
slow
way
it
be
a
fine
day
for
the
field
i
guess
i
go
with
the
oxen
over
to
that
big
meadow
just
look
said
ellen
how
the
light
comes
creeping
down
the
side
of
the
mountain
now
it
has
got
to
the
wood
oh
do
look
at
the
tops
of
the
trees
oh
i
wish
mamma
was
here
van
brunt
did
know
what
to
say
to
this
he
rather
wished
so
too
for
her
sake
there
said
ellen
now
the
sunshine
is
on
the
fence
and
the
road
and
everything
i
wonder
what
is
the
reason
that
the
sun
shines
first
upon
the
top
of
the
mountain
and
then
comes
so
slowly
down
the
side
why
do
it
shine
on
the
whole
at
once
van
brunt
shook
his
head
in
ignorance
he
guessed
it
always
did
so
he
said
yes
said
ellen
i
suppose
it
does
but
that
the
very
thing
i
want
to
know
the
reason
why
and
i
noticed
just
now
it
shone
in
my
face
before
it
touched
my
hands
is
it
queer
humph
there
a
great
many
queer
things
if
you
come
to
that
said
van
brunt
philosophically
but
ellen
head
ran
on
from
one
thing
to
another
and
her
next
question
was
not
so
wide
of
the
subject
as
her
companion
might
have
thought
van
brunt
are
there
any
schools
about
here
schools
said
the
person
addressed
yes
there
plenty
of
schools
good
ones
said
ellen
well
i
do
exactly
know
about
that
there
captain
conklin
that
had
ought
to
be
a
good
he
a
regular
smart
man
they
say
whereabouts
is
that
said
ellen
his
school
it
a
mile
or
so
the
other
side
of
my
house
and
how
far
is
it
from
your
house
to
aunt
fortune
a
good
deal
better
than
two
mile
but
we
be
there
before
long
you
ai
tired
be
you
no
said
ellen
but
this
reminder
gave
a
new
turn
to
her
thoughts
and
her
spirits
were
suddenly
checked
her
former
brisk
and
springing
step
changed
to
so
slow
and
lagging
a
one
that
van
brunt
more
than
once
repeated
his
remark
that
he
saw
she
was
tired
if
it
was
that
ellen
grew
tired
very
fast
she
lagged
more
and
more
as
they
neared
the
house
and
at
last
quite
fell
behind
and
allowed
van
brunt
to
go
in
first
miss
fortune
was
busy
about
the
breakfast
and
as
van
brunt
afterwards
described
it
looking
as
if
she
could
have
bitten
off
a
tenpenny
nail
and
indeed
as
if
the
operation
would
have
been
rather
gratifying
than
otherwise
she
gave
them
no
notice
at
first
bustling
to
and
fro
with
great
energy
but
all
of
a
sudden
she
brought
up
directly
in
front
of
ellen
and
said
why
did
you
come
home
last
night
the
words
were
jerked
out
rather
than
spoken
i
got
wet
in
the
brook
said
ellen
and
van
brunt
was
so
kind
as
to
keep
me
which
way
did
you
go
out
of
the
house
yesterday
through
the
front
door
the
front
door
was
locked
i
unlocked
it
what
did
you
go
out
that
way
for
i
did
want
to
come
this
way
why
not
ellen
hesitated
why
not
demanded
miss
fortune
still
more
emphatically
than
before
i
did
want
to
see
you
said
ellen
flushing
if
ever
you
do
so
again
said
miss
fortune
in
a
kind
of
cold
fury
i
a
great
mind
to
whip
you
for
this
as
ever
i
had
to
eat
the
flush
faded
on
ellen
cheek
and
a
shiver
visibly
passed
over
her
not
from
fear
she
stood
with
downcast
eyes
and
compressed
lips
a
certain
instinct
of
childish
dignity
warning
her
to
be
silent
van
brunt
put
himself
in
between
come
come
said
he
this
is
getting
to
be
too
much
of
a
good
thing
beat
your
cream
as
much
as
you
like
or
if
you
want
to
try
your
hand
on
something
else
you
have
to
take
me
first
i
promise
you
now
do
meddle
van
brunt
said
the
lady
sharply
with
what
ai
no
business
o
yourn
i
do
know
about
that
said
van
brunt
maybe
it
is
my
business
but
meddle
or
no
meddle
miss
fortune
it
is
time
for
me
to
be
in
the
field
and
if
you
no
better
breakfast
for
miss
ellen
and
me
than
all
this
here
we
just
go
right
away
hum
again
but
there
something
in
your
kettle
there
that
smells
uncommonly
nice
and
i
wish
you
just
let
us
have
it
and
no
more
words
no
more
words
did
miss
fortune
waste
on
any
one
that
morning
she
went
on
with
her
work
and
dished
up
the
breakfast
in
silence
and
with
a
face
that
ellen
did
not
quite
understand
only
she
thought
she
had
never
in
her
life
seen
one
so
disagreeable
the
meal
was
a
very
solemn
and
uncomfortable
one
ellen
could
scarcely
swallow
and
her
aunt
was
near
in
the
same
condition
van
brunt
and
the
old
lady
alone
despatched
their
breakfast
as
usual
with
no
other
attempts
at
conversation
than
the
common
mumbling
on
the
part
of
the
latter
which
nobody
minded
and
one
or
two
strange
grunts
from
the
former
the
meaning
of
which
if
they
had
any
nobody
tried
to
find
out
there
was
a
breach
now
between
ellen
and
her
aunt
that
neither
could
make
any
effort
to
mend
miss
fortune
did
not
renew
the
disagreeable
conversation
that
van
brunt
had
broken
off
she
left
ellen
entirely
to
herself
scarcely
speaking
to
her
or
seeming
to
know
when
she
went
out
or
came
in
and
this
lasted
day
after
day
wearily
they
passed
after
one
or
two
van
brunt
seemed
to
stand
just
where
he
did
before
in
miss
fortune
good
graces
but
not
ellen
to
her
when
others
were
not
by
her
face
wore
constantly
something
of
the
same
cold
hard
disagreeable
expression
it
had
put
on
after
van
interference
a
look
that
ellen
came
to
regard
with
absolute
abhorrence
she
kept
away
by
herself
as
much
as
she
could
but
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
her
time
and
for
want
of
something
better
often
spent
it
in
tears
she
went
to
bed
cheerless
night
after
night
and
arose
spiritless
morning
after
morning
and
this
lasted
till
van
brunt
more
than
once
told
his
mother
that
that
poor
little
thing
was
going
wandering
about
like
a
ghost
and
growing
thinner
and
paler
every
day
and
he
know
what
she
would
come
to
if
she
went
on
so
ellen
longed
now
for
a
letter
with
unspeakable
longing
but
none
came
day
after
day
brought
new
disappointment
each
day
more
hard
to
bear
of
her
only
friend
van
brunt
she
saw
little
he
was
much
away
in
the
fields
during
the
fine
weather
and
when
it
rained
ellen
herself
was
prisoner
at
home
whither
he
never
came
but
at
meal
times
the
old
grandmother
was
very
much
disposed
to
make
much
of
her
but
ellen
shrank
she
hardly
knew
why
from
her
fond
caresses
and
never
found
herself
alone
with
her
if
she
could
help
it
for
then
she
was
regularly
called
to
the
old
lady
side
and
obliged
to
go
through
a
course
of
kissing
fondling
and
praising
she
would
gladly
have
escaped
in
her
aunt
presence
this
was
seldom
attempted
and
never
permitted
to
go
on
miss
fortune
was
sure
to
pull
ellen
away
and
bid
her
mother
stop
that
palavering
avowing
that
it
made
her
sick
ellen
had
one
faint
hope
that
her
aunt
would
think
of
sending
her
to
school
as
she
employed
her
in
nothing
at
home
and
certainly
took
small
delight
in
her
company
but
no
hint
of
the
kind
dropped
from
miss
fortune
lips
and
longing
look
for
this
as
well
as
for
a
word
from
her
mother
was
daily
doomed
to
be
ungratified
and
to
grow
more
keen
by
delay
one
pleasure
only
remained
to
ellen
in
the
course
of
the
day
and
that
one
she
enjoyed
with
the
carefulness
of
a
miser
it
was
seeing
the
cows
milked
morning
and
evening
for
this
she
got
up
very
early
and
watched
till
the
men
came
for
the
pails
and
then
away
she
bounded
out
of
the
house
and
to
the
there
were
the
milky
mothers
five
in
number
standing
about
each
in
her
own
corner
of
the
yard
or
waiting
to
be
relieved
of
their
burden
of
milk
they
were
fine
gentle
animals
in
excellent
condition
and
looking
every
way
happy
and
comfortable
nothing
living
under
van
brunt
care
was
ever
suffered
to
look
otherwise
he
was
always
in
the
barn
or
at
milking
time
and
under
his
protection
ellen
felt
safe
and
looked
on
at
her
ease
it
was
a
very
pretty
scene
at
least
she
thought
so
the
gentle
cows
standing
quietly
to
be
milked
as
if
they
enjoyed
it
and
munching
the
cud
and
the
white
stream
of
milk
foaming
into
the
pails
then
there
was
the
interest
of
seeing
whether
sam
or
johnny
would
get
through
first
and
how
near
jane
or
dolly
would
come
to
rivalling
streaky
fine
pailful
and
at
last
ellen
allowed
van
brunt
to
teach
herself
how
to
milk
she
began
with
trembling
but
learnt
fast
enough
and
more
than
one
pailful
of
milk
that
miss
fortune
strained
had
been
unknown
to
her
drawn
by
ellen
fingers
these
minutes
in
the
were
the
pleasantest
in
ellen
day
while
they
lasted
every
care
was
forgotten
and
her
little
face
was
as
bright
as
the
morning
but
the
milking
was
quickly
over
and
the
cloud
gathered
on
ellen
brow
almost
as
soon
as
the
shadow
of
the
house
fell
upon
it
where
is
the
van
brunt
she
asked
one
morning
as
she
stood
watching
the
sharpening
of
an
axe
upon
the
grindstone
the
axe
was
in
that
gentleman
hand
and
its
edge
carefully
laid
to
the
whirling
stone
which
one
of
the
farm
boys
was
turning
where
is
the
why
over
to
thirlwall
to
be
sure
replied
van
brunt
glancing
up
at
her
from
his
work
faster
johnny
and
how
often
do
letters
come
here
said
ellen
take
care
johnny
some
more
water
mind
your
business
will
you
just
as
often
as
i
go
to
fetch
miss
ellen
and
no
oftener
and
how
often
do
you
go
van
brunt
only
when
i
some
other
errand
miss
ellen
my
grain
would
never
be
in
the
barn
if
i
was
running
to
every
other
thing
and
for
what
ai
there
too
i
do
get
a
letter
but
two
or
three
times
a
year
i
though
i
call
i
guess
times
ah
but
there
one
there
now
or
soon

be
i
know
for
me
said
ellen
when
do
you
think
you
go
again
van
brunt
now
if
i
ha
knowed
that
i
ha
gone
to
thirlwall
yesterday
i
was
within
a
mile
of
it
i
do
see
as
i
can
go
this
week
anyhow
in
the
world
but
i
make
some
errand
there
the
first
day
i
can
miss
ellen
that
you
may
depend
on
you
sha
wait
for
your
letter
a
bit
longer
than
i
can
help
oh
thank
you
van
brunt
you
are
very
kind
then
the
letters
never
come
except
when
you
go
after
them
no
yes
they
do
come
once
in
a
while
by
old
swaim
but
he
been
here
this
great
while
and
who
he
said
ellen
oh
he
a
queer
old
chip
that
goes
round
the
country
on
all
sorts
of
errands
he
comes
along
once
in
a
while
that
do
johnny
i
believe
this
here
tool
is
as
sharp
as
i
have
any
occasion
for
what
the
use
of
pouring
water
upon
the
grindstone
said
ellen
why
would
it
do
as
well
dry
i
ca
tell
i
am
sure
replied
van
brunt
who
was
slowly
drawing
his
thumb
over
the
edge
of
the
axe
your
questions
are
a
good
deal
too
sharp
for
me
miss
ellen
i
only
know
it
would
spoil
the
axe
or
the
grindstone
or
both
most
likely
it
very
odd
said
ellen
thoughtfully
i
wish
i
knew
everything
but
oh
dear
i
am
not
likely
to
know
anything
said
she
her
countenance
suddenly
changing
from
its
pleased
inquisitive
look
to
a
cloud
of
disappointment
and
sorrow
van
brunt
noticed
the
change
ai
your
aunt
going
to
send
you
to
school
then
said
he
i
do
know
said
ellen
sighing
she
never
speaks
about
it
nor
about
anything
else
but
i
declare
i
make
her
she
exclaimed
changing
again
i
go
right
in
and
ask
her
and
then
she
have
to
tell
me
i
will
i
am
tired
of
living
so
i
know
what
she
means
to
do
and
then
i
can
tell
you
what
must
do
van
brunt
seemingly
dubious
about
the
success
of
this
line
of
conduct
stroked
his
chin
and
his
axe
alternately
two
or
three
times
in
silence
and
finally
walked
off
ellen
without
waiting
for
her
courage
to
cool
went
directly
into
the
house
miss
fortune
however
was
not
in
the
kitchen
to
follow
her
into
her
secret
haunts
the
dairy
cellar
or
lower
kitchen
was
not
to
be
thought
of
ellen
waited
awhile
but
her
aunt
did
not
come
and
the
excitement
of
the
moment
cooled
down
she
was
not
quite
so
ready
to
enter
upon
the
business
as
she
had
felt
at
first
she
had
even
some
qualms
about
it
but
i
do
it
said
ellen
to
herself
it
will
be
hard
but
i
do
it
chapter
xiv
for
my
part
he
keeps
me
here
rustically
at
home
or
to
speak
more
properly
stays
me
here
at
home
unkept
as
you
like
it
the
next
morning
after
breakfast
ellen
found
the
chance
she
rather
dreaded
than
wished
for
van
brunt
had
gone
out
the
old
lady
had
not
left
her
room
and
miss
fortune
was
quietly
seated
by
the
fire
busied
with
some
mysteries
of
cooking
like
a
true
coward
ellen
could
not
make
up
her
mind
to
bolt
at
once
into
the
thick
of
the
matter
but
thought
to
come
to
it
gradually
always
a
bad
way
what
is
that
aunt
fortune
said
she
after
she
had
watched
her
with
a
beating
heart
for
about
five
minutes
what
is
what
i
mean
what
is
that
you
are
straining
through
the
colander
into
that
jar
what
is
it
for
i
scalding
this
meal
with
it
to
make
turnpikes
turnpikes
said
ellen
i
thought
turnpikes
were
high
smooth
roads
with
every
now
and
then
that
what
mamma
told
me
they
were
that
all
the
kind
of
turnpikes
your
mamma
knew
anything
about
i
reckon
said
miss
fortune
in
a
tone
that
conveyed
the
notion
that
montgomery
education
had
been
very
incomplete
and
indeed
she
added
immediately
after
if
she
had
made
more
turnpikes
and
paid
fewer
tolls
it
would
have
been
just
as
well
i
thinking
ellen
felt
the
tone
if
she
did
not
thoroughly
understand
the
words
she
was
silent
a
moment
then
remembering
her
purpose
she
began
again
what
are
these
then
aunt
fortune
cakes
child
cakes
turnpike
cakes
what
i
raise
the
bread
with
what
those
little
brown
cakes
i
have
seen
you
melt
in
water
and
mix
in
the
flour
when
you
make
bread
mercy
on
us
yes
you
seen
hundreds
of
since
you
been
here
if
you
never
saw
one
before
i
never
did
said
ellen
but
what
are
they
called
turnpikes
for
the
land
knows
i
do
for
mercy
sake
stop
asking
me
questions
ellen
i
do
know
what
got
into
you
you
drive
me
crazy
but
there
one
more
question
i
want
to
ask
very
much
said
ellen
with
her
heart
beating
well
ask
it
then
quick
and
have
done
and
take
yourself
off
i
have
other
fish
to
fry
than
to
answer
all
your
questions
miss
fortune
however
was
still
quietly
seated
by
the
fire
stirring
her
meal
and
and
ellen
could
not
be
quick
the
words
stuck
in
her
throat
came
out
at
last
aunt
fortune
i
wanted
to
ask
you
if
i
may
go
to
school
yes
ellen
heart
sprang
with
a
feeling
of
joy
a
little
qualified
by
the
peculiar
dry
tone
in
which
the
word
was
uttered
when
may
i
go
as
soon
as
you
like
oh
thank
you
to
which
school
shall
i
go
aunt
fortune
to
whichever
you
like
but
i
do
know
anything
about
them
said
ellen
how
can
i
tell
which
is
best
miss
fortune
was
silent
what
schools
are
there
near
here
said
ellen
there
captain
conklin
down
at
the
cross
and
miss
emerson
at
thirlwall
ellen
hesitated
the
name
was
against
her
but
nevertheless
she
concluded
on
the
whole
that
the
lady
school
would
be
the
pleasantest
is
miss
emerson
any
relation
of
yours
she
asked
no
i
think
i
should
like
to
go
to
her
school
the
best
i
will
go
there
if
you
will
let
me
may
i
yes
and
i
will
begin
next
monday
may
i
yes
ellen
wished
exceedingly
that
her
aunt
would
speak
in
some
other
tone
of
voice
it
was
a
continual
damper
to
her
rising
hopes
i
get
my
books
ready
said
she
and
look
over
a
little
too
i
guess
but
what
will
be
the
best
way
for
me
to
go
aunt
fortune
i
do
know
i
could
walk
so
far
could
i
you
know
best
i
could
i
am
sure
said
ellen
it
four
miles
to
thirlwall
van
brunt
said
that
would
be
too
much
for
me
to
walk
twice
a
day
and
i
should
be
afraid
besides
a
dead
silence
but
aunt
fortune
do
please
tell
me
what
i
am
to
do
how
can
i
know
unless
you
tell
me
what
way
is
there
that
i
can
go
to
school
it
is
unfortunate
that
i
do
keep
a
carriage
said
miss
fortune
but
van
brunt
can
go
for
you
morning
and
evening
in
the
if
that
will
answer
the
but
dear
me
it
would
take
him
all
day
aunt
fortune
it
takes
hours
and
hours
to
go
and
come
with
the
oxen
van
brunt
would
have
time
to
do
anything
but
carry
me
to
school
and
bring
me
home
of
course
but
that
of
no
consequence
said
miss
fortune
in
the
same
dry
tone
then
i
ca
go
there
no
help
for
it
said
ellen
despondingly
why
did
you
say
so
before
when
you
said
yes
i
thought
you
meant
yes
she
covered
her
face
miss
fortune
rose
with
a
half
smile
and
carried
her
jar
of
scalded
meal
into
the
pantry
she
then
came
back
and
commenced
the
operation
of
the
breakfast
things
ah
if
i
only
had
a
little
pony
said
ellen
that
would
carry
me
there
and
back
and
go
trotting
about
with
me
everywhere
how
nice
that
would
be
yes
that
would
be
very
nice
and
who
do
you
think
would
go
trotting
about
after
the
pony
i
suppose
you
would
leave
that
to
van
brunt
and
i
should
have
to
go
trotting
about
after
you
to
pick
you
up
in
case
you
broke
your
neck
in
some
ditch
or
gully
it
would
be
a
very
nice
affair
altogether
i
think
ellen
was
silent
her
hopes
had
fallen
to
the
ground
and
her
disappointment
was
unsoothed
by
one
word
of
kindness
or
sympathy
with
all
her
old
grievances
fresh
in
her
mind
she
sat
thinking
her
aunt
was
the
very
most
disagreeable
person
she
ever
had
the
misfortune
to
meet
with
no
amiable
feelings
were
working
within
her
and
the
cloud
on
her
brow
was
of
displeasure
and
disgust
as
well
as
sadness
and
sorrow
her
aunt
saw
it
what
are
you
thinking
of
said
she
rather
sharply
i
am
thinking
said
ellen
i
am
very
sorry
i
can
not
go
to
school
why
what
do
you
want
to
learn
so
much
you
know
how
to
read
and
write
and
cipher
do
you
read
and
write
and
cipher
said
ellen
to
be
sure
i
do
but
nothing
that
only
the
beginning
well
what
do
you
want
to
learn
besides
oh
a
great
many
things
well
what
oh
a
great
many
things
said
ellen
french
and
italian
and
latin
and
music
and
arithmetic
and
chemistry
and
all
about
animals
and
plants
and
insects
i
forget
what
it
called
and
oh
i
recollect
a
great
many
things
every
now
and
then
i
think
of
something
i
want
to
learn
i
ca
remember
them
now
but
i
doing
nothing
said
ellen
sadly
learning
nothing
i
am
not
studying
and
improving
myself
as
i
meant
to
mamma
will
be
disappointed
when
she
comes
back
and
i
meant
to
please
her
so
much
the
tears
were
fast
coming
she
put
her
hand
upon
her
eyes
to
force
them
back
if
you
are
so
tired
of
being
idle
said
miss
fortune
i
warrant
i
give
you
something
to
do
and
something
to
learn
too
that
you
want
enough
more
than
all
those
crinkumcrankums
i
wonder
what
good
ever
do
you
that
the
way
your
mother
was
brought
up
i
suppose
if
she
had
been
trained
to
use
her
hands
and
do
something
useful
instead
of
thinking
herself
above
it
maybe
she
would
have
had
to
go
to
sea
for
her
health
just
now
it
does
do
for
women
to
be
bookworms
mamma
is
a
bookworm
said
ellen
indignantly
i
do
know
what
you
mean
and
she
never
thinks
herself
above
being
useful
it
very
strange
you
should
say
so
when
you
do
know
anything
about
her
i
know
she
brought
you
up
to
know
manners
anyhow
said
miss
fortune
look
here
i
give
you
something
to
do
just
you
put
those
plates
and
dishes
together
ready
for
washing
while
i
am
downstairs
ellen
obeyed
unwillingly
enough
she
had
neither
knowledge
of
the
business
nor
any
liking
for
it
so
it
is
no
wonder
miss
fortune
at
her
return
was
not
well
pleased
but
i
never
did
such
a
thing
before
said
ellen
there
it
is
now
said
miss
fortune
i
wonder
where
your
eyes
have
been
every
single
time
that
i
have
done
it
since
you
have
been
here
i
should
think
your
own
sense
might
have
told
you
but
you
too
busy
learning
of
van
brunt
to
know
what
going
on
in
the
house
is
that
what
you
call
made
ready
for
washing
now

have
the
goodness
to
scrape
every
plate
clean
off
and
put
them
nicely
in
a
pile
here
and
turn
out
the
slops
out
of
the
and
saucers
and
set
them
by
themselves

what
makes
you
handle
them
so

you
afraid

i
do
like
to
take
hold
of
things

drunk
out
of
said
ellen
who
was
indeed
touching
the
cups
and
saucers
very
delicately
with
the
tips
of
her
fingers

in
that
cupboard
and
set
the
butter
up
here
and
put
the
bread
in
this
box
do
you
see
now
do
let
me
have
to
show
you
twice
over
this
was
ellen
first
introduction
to
the
buttery
she
had
never
dared
to
go
in
there
before
it
was
a
long
light
closet
or
pantry
lined
on
the
left
side
and
at
the
further
end
with
wide
shelves
up
to
the
ceiling
on
these
shelves
stood
many
capacious
pans
and
basins
of
tin
and
earthenware
filled
with
milk
and
most
of
them
coated
with
superb
yellow
cream
midway
was
the
window
before
which
miss
fortune
was
accustomed
to
skim
her
milk
and
at
the
side
of
it
was
the
mouth
of
a
wooden
pipe
or
covered
trough
which
conveyed
the
refuse
milk
down
to
an
enormous
hogshead
standing
at
the
lower
kitchen
door
whence
it
was
drawn
as
wanted
for
the
use
of
the
pigs
beyond
the
window
in
the
buttery
and
on
the
higher
shelves
were
rows
of
yellow
cheeses
forty
or
fifty
were
there
at
least
on
the
right
hand
of
the
door
was
the
cupboard
and
a
short
range
of
shelves
which
held
in
ordinary
all
sorts
of
matters
for
the
table
both
dishes
and
eatables
floor
and
shelves
were
well
painted
with
thick
yellow
paint
hard
and
shining
and
clean
as
could
be
and
there
was
a
faint
pleasant
smell
of
dairy
things
ellen
did
not
find
out
all
this
at
once
but
in
the
course
of
a
day
or
two
during
which
her
visits
to
the
buttery
were
many
miss
fortune
kept
her
word
and
found
her
plenty
to
do
ellen
life
soon
became
a
pretty
busy
one
she
did
not
like
this
at
all
it
was
a
kind
of
work
she
had
no
love
for
yet
no
doubt
it
was
a
good
exchange
for
the
miserable
moping
life
she
had
lately
led
anything
was
better
than
that
one
concern
however
lay
upon
poor
ellen
mind
with
pressing
weight
her
neglected
studies
and
wasted
time
for
no
better
than
wasted
she
counted
it
what
shall
i
do
she
said
to
herself
after
several
of
these
busy
days
had
passed
i
am
doing
nothing
i
am
learning
nothing
i
shall
forget
all
i
have
learnt
directly
at
this
rate
i
shall
not
know
any
more
than
all
these
people
around
me
and
what
mamma
say
well
if
i
ca
go
to
school
i
know
what
i
will
do
she
said
taking
a
sudden
resolve
i
study
by
myself
i
see
what
i
can
do
it
will
be
better
than
nothing
any
way
i
begin
this
very
day
with
new
life
ellen
sprang
upstairs
to
her
room
and
forthwith
began
pulling
all
the
things
out
of
her
trunk
to
get
at
her
books
they
were
at
the
very
bottom
and
by
the
time
she
had
reached
them
half
the
floor
was
strewn
with
the
various
articles
of
her
wardrobe
without
minding
them
in
her
first
eagerness
ellen
pounced
at
the
books
here
you
are
my
dear
numa
pompilius
said
she
drawing
out
a
little
french
book
she
had
just
begun
to
read
and
here
are
old
grammar
and
dictionary
and
here
is
my
history
very
glad
to
see
you
goldsmith
and
what
in
the
world
this
wrapped
up
as
if
it
was
something
great
oh
my
expositor
i
am
not
glad
to
see
i
am
sure
never
want
to
look
at
your
face
or
your
back
again
my
i
wonder
who
set
copies
for
me
now
my
arithmetic
you
geography
and
atlas
all
right
and
my
slate
but
dear
me
i
believe
i
such
a
thing
as
a
in
the
world
where
shall
i
get
one
i
wonder
well
i
manage
and
that
all
that
all
i
believe
with
all
her
heart
ellen
would
have
begun
her
studying
at
once
but
there
were
all
her
things
on
the
floor
silently
saying
put
us
up
first
i
declare
said
she
to
herself
it
too
bad
to
have
nothing
in
the
shape
of
a
bureau
to
keep
one
clothes
in
i
wonder
if
i
am
to
live
in
a
trunk
as
mamma
says
all
the
time
i
am
here
and
have
to
go
down
to
the
bottom
of
it
every
time
i
want
a
or
a
pair
of
stockings
how
i
do
despise
those
grey
stockings
but
what
can
i
do
it
too
bad
to
squeeze
my
nice
things
up
so
i
wonder
what
is
behind
those
doors
i
find
out
i
know
before
long
on
the
north
side
of
ellen
room
were
three
doors
she
had
never
opened
them
but
now
took
it
into
her
head
to
see
what
was
there
thinking
she
might
possibly
find
what
would
help
her
out
of
her
difficulty
she
had
some
little
fear
of
meddling
with
anything
in
her
aunt
domain
so
she
fastened
her
own
door
to
guard
against
interruption
while
she
was
busied
in
making
discoveries
at
the
foot
of
her
bed
in
the
corner
was
one
large
door
fastened
by
a
button
as
indeed
they
were
all
this
opened
she
found
upon
a
flight
of
stairs
leading
as
she
supposed
to
the
garret
but
ellen
did
not
care
to
go
up
and
see
they
were
lighted
by
half
of
a
large
window
across
the
middle
of
which
the
stairs
went
up
she
quickly
shut
that
door
and
opened
the
next
a
little
one
here
she
found
a
tiny
closet
under
the
stairs
lighted
by
the
other
half
of
the
window
there
was
nothing
in
it
but
a
broad
low
shelf
or
step
under
the
stairs
where
ellen
presently
decided
she
could
stow
away
her
books
very
nicely
it
only
wants
a
little
brushing
out
said
ellen
and
it
will
do
very
well
the
other
door
in
the
other
corner
admitted
her
to
a
large
light
closet
perfectly
empty
now
if
there
were
only
some
hooks
or
pegs
here
thought
ellen
to
hang
up
dresses
on
but
why
should
i
drive
some
nails
i
will
i
will
oh
that
be
fine
unfastening
her
door
in
a
hurry
she
ran
downstairs
and
her
heart
beating
between
pleasure
and
the
excitement
of
daring
so
far
without
her
aunt
knowledge
she
ran
out
and
crossed
the
to
the
barn
where
she
had
some
hope
of
finding
van
brunt
by
the
time
she
got
to
the
little
door
a
great
noise
of
knocking
or
pounding
in
the
barn
made
her
sure
he
was
there
and
she
went
on
to
the
lower
there
he
was
he
and
the
two
farm
boys
who
were
grown
men
all
three
threshing
wheat
ellen
stopped
at
the
door
and
for
a
minute
forgot
what
she
had
come
for
in
the
pleasure
of
looking
at
them
the
clean
floor
was
strewn
with
grain
upon
which
the
heavy
flails
came
down
one
after
another
with
quick
regular
beat
one
two
three
one
two
three
keeping
perfect
time
the
pleasant
sound
could
be
heard
afar
off
though
indeed
where
ellen
stood
it
was
rather
too
loud
to
be
pleasant
her
little
voice
had
no
chance
of
being
heard
she
stood
still
and
waited
presently
johnny
who
was
opposite
caught
a
sight
of
her
and
without
stopping
his
work
said
to
his
leader
somebody
there
for
you
van
brunt
that
gentleman
flail
ceased
its
motion
then
he
threw
it
down
and
went
to
the
door
to
help
ellen
up
the
high
step
well
said
he
have
you
come
out
to
see
what
going
on
no
said
ellen
i
been
looking
but
van
brunt
could
you
be
so
good
as
to
let
me
have
a
hammer
and
nails
a
hammer
and
nails
come
this
way
said
he
they
went
out
of
the
and
across
the
to
an
below
the
garden
and
not
far
from
the
spout
called
the
though
it
was
quite
as
much
the
property
of
the
hogs
who
had
a
regular
sleeping
apartment
there
where
corn
was
always
fed
out
to
the
fatting
ones
opening
a
kind
of
granary
storeroom
where
the
corn
for
this
purpose
was
stored
van
brunt
took
down
from
a
shelf
a
large
hammer
and
a
box
of
nails
and
asked
ellen
what
size
she
wanted
pretty
large
so
no
a
good
deal
bigger
yet
i
should
like
good
deal
bigger
yet

ellen
smiling

big
hammer

i
guess
so

try

up
in
a
closet
in

room

ellen
speaking
as
softly
as
if
she
had
feared
her
aunt

at
the
corner
i
want
to
hang
up
dresses
and
things
van
brunt
half
smiled
and
put
up
the
hammer
and
nails
on
the
shelf
again
now
i
tell
you
what
we
do
said
he
you

about

said
he
i
fix
it
maybe
we
wo
ask
her
oh
thank

said
ellen
joyfully
her
face
recovering
its
full
sunshine
in
answer
to
his
smile
and
clapping
her
hands
she
ran
back
to
the
house
while
more
slowly
van
brunt
returned
to
the
threshers
ellen
seized
and
brush
and
ran
up
to
her
room
and
setting
about
the
business
with
right
good
will
she
soon
had
her
closets
in
beautiful
order
the
books
and
were
then
bestowed
very
carefully
in
the
one
in
the
other
her
coats
and
dresses
neatly
folded
up
in
a
pile
on
the
floor
waiting
till
the
nails
should
be
driven
then
the
remainder
of
her
things
were
gathered
up
from
the
floor
and
neatly
arranged
in
the
trunk
again
having
done
all
this
ellen
satisfaction
was
unbounded
by
this
time
dinner
was
ready
as
soon
after
dinner
as
she
could
escape
from
miss
fortune
calls
upon
her
ellen
stole
up
to
her
room
and
her
books
and
began
work
in
earnest
the
whole
afternoon
was
spent
over
sums
and
verbs
and
maps
and
pages
of
history
a
little
before
tea
as
ellen
was
setting
the
table
van

into
the
kitchen
with
a
bag
on
his
back
what

my
shoes

door
miss
ellen
i
believe
i
got
to
go
through
your
room
ellen
was
glad
to
run
before
to
hide
her
laughter
when
they
reached
her
room
van
brunt
produced
a
hammer
out
of
the
bag
and
taking
a
handful
of
nails
from
his
pocket
put
up
a
fine
row
of
them
along
her
closet
wall
then
while
she
hung
up
her
dresses
he
went
on
to
the
garret
and
ellen
heard
him
hammering
there
too
presently
he
came
down
and
they
returned
to
the
kitchen

coolly
up

in

closet
she
said
she
wanted
some
you

ha
spoke
to
about
it
said
miss
fortune
to
ellen
there
was
displeasure
enough
in
her
face
but
she
said
no
more
and
the
matter
blew
over
much
better
than
ellen
had
feared
ellen
steadily
pursued
her
plan
of
studying
in
spite
of
some
discouragements
a
letter
written
about
ten
days
after
gave
her
mother
an
account
of
her
endeavours
and
of
her
success
it
was
a
despairing
account
ellen
complained
that
she
wanted
help
to
understand
and
lacked
time
to
study
that
her
aunt
kept
her
busy
and
she
believed
took
pleasure
in
breaking
her
off
from
her
books
and
she
bitterly
said
her
mother
must
expect
to
find
an
ignorant
little
daughter
when
she
came
home
it
ended
with
oh
if
i
could
just
see
you
and
kiss
you
and
put
my
arms
round
you
mamma
i
be
willing
to
die
this
letter
was
despatched
the
next
morning
by
van
brunt
and
ellen
waited
and
watched
with
great
anxiety
for
his
return
from
thirlwall
in
the
afternoon
chapter
xv
an
ant
dropped
into
the
water
a
wood
pigeon
took
pity
of
her
and
threw
her
a
little
the
afternoon
was
already
half
spent
when
van
brunt
was
seen
returning
ellen
was
standing
by
the
little
gate
that
opened
on
the
and
with
her
heart
beating
anxiously
she
watched
the
oxen
how
slowly
they
came
at
last
they
turned
out
of
the
lane
and
drew
the
cart
up
the
ascent
and
stopping
beneath
the
van
brunt
leisurely
got
down
and
flinging
back
his
whip
came
to
the
gate
but
the
little
face
that
met
him
there
quivering
with
hope
and
fear
made
his
own
quite
sober
i
really
sorry
miss
ellen
he
began
that
was
enough
ellen
waited
to
hear
no
more
but
turned
away
the
cold
chill
of
disappointment
coming
over
her
heart
she
had
borne
the
former
delays
pretty
well
but
this
was
one
too
many
and
she
felt
sick
she
went
round
to
the
front
stoop
where
scarcely
ever
anybody
came
and
sitting
down
on
the
steps
wept
sadly
and
despairingly
it
might
have
been
or
more
after
that
the
kitchen
door
slowly
opened
and
ellen
came
in
wishing
her
aunt
should
not
see
her
swollen
eyes
she
was
going
quietly
through
to
her
own
room
when
miss
fortune
called
her
ellen
stopped
miss
fortune
was
sitting
before
the
fire
with
an
open
letter
lying
in
her
lap
and
another
in
her
hand
the
latter
she
held
out
to
ellen
saying
here
child
come
and
take
this
what
is
it
said
ellen
slowly
coming
towards
her
do
you
see
what
it
is
said
miss
fortune
still
holding
it
out
but
who
is
it
from
said
ellen
your
mother
a
letter
from
mamma
and
not
to
me
said
ellen
with
changing
colour
she
took
it
quick
from
her
aunt
hand
but
her
colour
changed
more
as
her
eye
fell
upon
the
first
words
my
dear
ellen
and
turning
the
paper
she
saw
upon
the
back
miss
ellen
montgomery
her
next
look
was
to
her
aunt
face
with
her
eye
fired
and
her
cheek
paled
with
anger
and
when
she
spoke
her
voice
was
not
the
same
this
is
letter
she
said
trembling
who
opened
it
miss
fortune
conscience
must
have
troubled
her
a
little
for
her
eye
wavered
uneasily
only
for
a
second
though
who
opened
it
she
answered
opened
it
i
should
like
to
know
who
has
a
better
right
and
i
shall
open
every
one
that
comes
to
serve
you
for
looking
so
that
you
may
depend
upon
the
look
and
the
words
and
the
injury
together
fairly
put
ellen
beside
herself
she
dashed
the
letter
to
the
ground
and
livid
and
trembling
with
various
feelings
rage
was
not
the
only
one
she
ran
from
her
aunt
presence
she
did
not
shed
any
tears
now
she
could
not
they
were
absolutely
burnt
up
by
passion
she
walked
her
room
with
trembling
steps
clasping
and
wringing
her
hands
now
and
then
wildly
thinking
what
she
do
to
get
out
of
this
dreadful
state
of
things
and
unable
to
see
anything
but
misery
before
her
she
walked
for
she
could
not
sit
down
but
presently
she
felt
that
she
could
not
breathe
the
air
of
the
house
and
taking
her
bonnet
she
went
down
passed
through
the
kitchen
and
went
out
miss
fortune
asked
where
she
was
going
and
bade
her
stay
within
doors
but
ellen
paid
no
attention
to
her
she
stood
still
a
moment
outside
the
little
gate
she
might
have
stood
long
to
look
the
mellow
light
of
an
indian
summer
afternoon
lay
upon
the
meadow
and
the
old
barn
and
there
was
beauty
in
them
all
under
its
smile
not
a
breath
was
stirring
the
rays
of
the
sun
struggled
through
the
blue
haze
which
hung
upon
the
hills
and
softened
every
distant
object
and
the
silence
of
nature
all
around
was
absolute
made
more
noticeable
by
the
voice
of
somebody
it
might
be
van
brunt
calling
to
his
oxen
very
far
off
and
not
to
be
seen
the
sound
came
softly
to
her
ear
through
the
stillness
peace
was
the
whisper
of
nature
to
her
troubled
child
but
ellen
heart
was
in
a
whirl
she
could
not
hear
the
whisper
it
was
a
relief
however
to
be
out
of
the
house
and
in
the
sweet
open
air
ellen
breathed
more
freely
and
pausing
a
moment
there
and
clasping
her
hands
together
once
more
in
sorrow
she
went
down
the
road
and
out
at
the
gate
and
exchanging
her
quick
broken
step
for
a
slow
measured
one
she
took
the
way
towards
thirlwall
little
regarding
the
loveliness
which
that
day
was
upon
every
slope
and
roadside
ellen
presently
quitted
the
thirlwall
road
and
half
unconsciously
turned
into
a
path
on
the
left
which
she
had
never
taken
before
perhaps
for
that
reason
it
was
not
much
travelled
evidently
the
grass
grew
green
on
both
sides
and
even
in
the
middle
of
the
way
though
here
and
there
the
track
of
wheels
could
be
seen
ellen
did
not
care
about
where
she
was
going
she
only
found
it
pleasant
to
walk
on
and
get
farther
from
home
the
road
or
lane
led
towards
a
mountain
somewhat
to
the
northwest
of
miss
fortune
the
same
which
van
brunt
had
once
named
to
ellen
as
the
nose
after
of
an
hour
the
road
began
gently
to
ascend
the
mountain
rising
towards
the
north
about
of
the
way
from
the
bottom
ellen
came
to
a
little
footpath
on
the
left
which
allured
her
by
its
promise
of
prettiness
and
she
forsook
the
lane
for
it
the
promise
was
abundantly
fulfilled
it
was
a
most
lovely
wild
path
but
withal
not
a
little
steep
and
rocky
ellen
began
to
grow
weary
the
lane
went
on
towards
the
north
the
path
rather
led
off
towards
the
southern
edge
of
the
mountain
rising
all
the
while
but
before
she
reached
that
ellen
came
to
what
she
thought
a
good
where
the
path
opened
upon
a
small
level
platform
or
ledge
of
the
hill
the
mountain
rose
steep
behind
her
and
sank
very
steep
immediately
before
her
leaving
a
very
superb
view
of
the
open
country
from
the
to
the
carpeted
with
moss
and
furnished
with
fallen
stones
and
pieces
of
rock
this
was
a
fine
for
the
wayfarer
or
for
the
lover
of
nature
ellen
seated
herself
on
one
of
the
stones
and
looked
sadly
and
wearily
towards
the
east
at
first
very
careless
of
the
exceeding
beauty
of
what
she
beheld
there
for
miles
and
miles
on
every
side
but
the
west
lay
stretched
before
her
a
beautifully
broken
country
the
november
haze
hung
over
it
now
like
a
thin
veil
giving
great
sweetness
and
softness
to
the
scene
far
in
the
distance
a
range
of
low
hills
showed
like
a
misty
cloud
near
by
at
the
mountain
foot
the
fields
and
and
roads
lay
a
pictured
map
about
a
mile
and
a
half
to
the
south
rose
the
mountain
where
nancy
vawse
lived
craggy
and
bare
but
the
leafless
trees
and
stern
jagged
rocks
were
wrapped
in
the
haze
and
through
this
the
sun
now
near
the
setting
threw
his
mellowing
rays
touching
every
slope
and
ridge
with
a
rich
warm
glow
poor
ellen
did
not
heed
the
picturesque
effect
of
all
this
yet
the
sweet
influences
of
nature
reached
her
and
softened
while
they
increased
her
sorrow
she
felt
her
own
heart
sadly
out
of
tune
with
the
peace
and
loveliness
of
all
she
saw
her
eye
sought
those
distant
hills
how
very
far
off
they
were
and
yet
all
that
wide
tract
of
country
was
but
a
little
piece
of
what
lay
between
her
and
her
mother
her
eye
sought
those
hills
but
her
mind
overpassed
them
and
went
far
beyond
over
many
such
a
tract
till
it
reached
the
loved
one
at
last
but
oh
how
much
between
i
can
not
reach
her
she
can
not
reach
me
thought
poor
ellen
her
eyes
had
been
filling
and
dropping
tears
for
some
time
but
now
came
the
rush
of
the
storm
and
the
floods
of
grief
were
kept
back
no
longer
when
once
fairly
excited
ellen
passions
were
always
extreme
during
the
former
peaceful
and
happy
part
of
her
life
the
occasions
of
such
excitement
had
been
very
rare
of
late
unhappily
they
had
occurred
much
oftener
many
were
the
bitter
fits
of
tears
she
had
known
within
a
few
weeks
but
now
it
seemed
as
if
all
the
scattered
causes
of
sorrow
that
had
wrought
those
tears
were
gathered
together
and
pressing
upon
her
at
once
and
that
the
burden
would
crush
her
to
the
earth
to
the
earth
it
brought
her
literally
she
slid
from
her
seat
at
first
and
embracing
the
stone
on
which
she
had
sat
she
leaned
her
head
there
but
presently
in
her
agony
quitting
her
hold
of
that
she
cast
herself
down
upon
the
moss
lying
at
full
length
upon
the
cold
ground
which
seemed
to
her
childish
fancy
the
best
friend
she
had
left
but
ellen
was
wrought
up
to
the
last
pitch
of
grief
and
passion
tears
brought
no
relief
convulsive
weeping
only
exhausted
her
in
the
extremity
of
her
distress
and
despair
and
in
that
lonely
place
out
of
hearing
of
every
one
she
sobbed
aloud
and
even
screamed
for
almost
the
first
time
in
her
life
and
these
fits
of
violence
were
succeeded
by
exhaustion
during
which
she
ceased
to
shed
tears
and
lay
quite
still
drawing
only
long
sobbing
sighs
now
and
then
how
long
ellen
had
lain
there
or
how
long
this
would
have
gone
on
before
her
strength
had
been
quite
worn
out
no
one
can
tell
in
one
of
these
fits
of
forced
quiet
when
she
lay
as
still
as
the
rocks
around
her
she
heard
a
voice
close
by
say
what
is
the
matter
my
child
the
silver
sweetness
of
the
tone
came
singularly
upon
the
tempest
in
ellen
mind
she
got
up
hastily
and
brushing
away
the
tears
from
her
dimmed
eyes
she
saw
a
young
lady
standing
there
and
a
face
whose
sweetness
well
matched
the
voice
looking
upon
her
with
grave
concern
she
stood
motionless
and
silent
what
is
the
matter
my
dear
the
tone
found
ellen
heart
and
brought
the
water
to
her
eyes
again
though
with
a
difference
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
but
gentle
hands
were
placed
upon
hers
and
drew
them
away
and
the
lady
sitting
down
on
ellen
stone
took
her
in
her
arms
and
ellen
hid
her
face
in
the
bosom
of
a
better
friend
than
the
cold
earth
had
been
like
to
prove
her
but
the
change
overcame
her
and
the
soft
whisper
cry
any
more
made
it
impossible
to
stop
crying
nothing
further
was
said
for
some
time
the
lady
waited
till
ellen
grew
calmer
when
she
saw
her
able
to
answer
she
said
gently
what
does
all
this
mean
my
child
what
troubles
you
tell
me
and
i
think
we
can
find
a
way
to
mend
matters
ellen
answered
the
tone
of
voice
with
a
faint
smile
but
the
words
with
another
gush
of
tears
you
are
ellen
montgomery
are
you
yes
i
thought
so
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
seen
you
i
have
seen
you
once
before
ellen
looked
up
surprised
have
you
i
am
sure
i
have
never
seen
you
no
i
know
that
i
saw
you
when
you
did
see
me
where
do
you
think
i
ca
tell
i
am
sure
said
ellen
i
ca
guess
i
have
seen
you
at
aunt
fortune
and
i
have
been
anywhere
else
you
have
forgotten
said
the
lady
did
you
never
hear
of
a
little
girl
who
went
to
take
a
walk
once
upon
a
time
and
had
an
unlucky
fall
into
a
brook
and
then
went
to
a
kind
old
lady
house
where
she
was
dried
and
put
to
bed
and
went
to
sleep
oh
yes
said
ellen
did
you
see
me
there
and
when
i
was
asleep
i
saw
you
there
when
you
were
asleep
and
van
brunt
told
me
who
you
were
and
where
you
lived
and
when
i
came
here
a
little
while
ago
i
knew
you
again
very
soon
and
i
knew
what
the
matter
was
too
pretty
well
but
nevertheless
tell
me
all
about
it
ellen
perhaps
i
can
help
you
ellen
shook
her
head
dejectedly
nobody
in
this
world
can
help
me
she
said
then
there
one
in
heaven
that
can
said
the
lady
steadily
nothing
is
too
bad
for
him
to
mend
have
you
asked
help
ellen
ellen
began
to
weep
again
oh
if
i
could
i
would
tell
you
all
about
it
she
said
but
there
are
so
many
things
i
do
know
where
to
begin
i
do
know
when
i
should
ever
get
through
so
many
things
that
trouble
you
ellen
yes
i
am
sorry
for
that
indeed
but
never
mind
dear
tell
me
what
they
are
begin
with
the
worst
and
if
i
have
time
to
hear
them
all
now
i
find
time
another
day
begin
with
the
worst
but
she
waited
in
vain
for
an
answer
and
became
distressed
herself
at
ellen
distress
which
was
extreme
do
cry
so
my
child
do
cry
so
she
said
pressing
her
in
her
arms
what
is
the
matter
hardly
anything
in
this
world
is
so
bad
it
ca
be
mended
i
think
i
know
what
troubles
you
so
it
is
that
your
dear
mother
is
away
from
you
is
it
oh
no
ellen
could
scarcely
articulate
but
struggling
with
herself
for
a
minute
or
two
she
then
spoke
again
and
more
clearly
the
worst
is
oh
the
worst
is
that
i
meant
i
meant
to
be
a
good
child
and
i
have
been
worse
than
ever
i
was
in
my
life
before
her
tears
gushed
forth
but
how
ellen
said
her
surprised
friend
after
a
pause
i
quite
understand
you
when
did
you
to
be
a
good
child
did
you
always
mean
so
and
what
have
you
been
doing
ellen
made
a
great
effort
and
ceased
crying
straightened
herself
dashed
away
her
tears
as
if
determined
to
shed
no
more
and
presently
spoke
calmly
though
a
choking
sob
every
now
and
then
threatened
to
interrupt
her
i
will
tell
you
the
first
day
i
left
mamma
when
i
was
on
board
the
steamboat
and
feeling
as
badly
as
i
could
feel
a
kind
kind
gentleman
i
do
know
who
he
was
came
to
me
and
spoke
to
me
and
took
care
of
me
the
whole
day
oh
if
i
could
see
him
again
he
talked
to
me
a
great
deal
he
wanted
me
to
be
a
christian
he
wanted
me
to
make
up
my
mind
to
begin
that
day
to
be
one
and
i
did
i
did
resolve
with
my
whole
heart
and
i
thought
i
should
be
different
from
that
time
from
what
i
had
ever
been
before
but
i
think
i
have
never
been
so
bad
in
my
life
as
i
have
been
since
then
instead
of
feeling
right
i
have
felt
wrong
all
the
time
almost
and
i
ca
help
it
i
have
been
passionate
and
cross
and
bad
feelings
keep
coming
and
i
know
wrong
and
it
makes
me
miserable
and
yet
oh
i
have
changed
my
mind
a
bit
i
think
just
the
same
as
i
did
that
day
i
want
to
be
a
christian
more
than
anything
else
in
the
world
but
i
am
not
and
what
shall
i
do
her
face
sank
into
her
hands
again
and
this
is
your
great
trouble
said
her
friend
yes
do
you
remember
who
said
unto
me
all
ye
that
labour
and
are
heavy
laden
and
i
will
give
you
rest
ellen
looked
up
inquiringly
you
are
grieved
to
find
yourself
so
unlike
what
you
would
be
you
wish
to
be
a
child
of
the
dear
saviour
and
to
have
your
heart
filled
with
his
love
and
to
do
what
will
please
him
do
you
have
you
gone
to
him
day
by
day
and
night
by
night
and
told
him
so
have
you
begged
him
to
give
you
strength
to
get
the
better
of
your
wrong
feelings
and
asked
him
to
change
you
and
make
you
his
child
at
first
i
did
said
ellen
in
a
low
voice
not
lately
no
in
a
low
tone
still
and
looking
down
then
you
have
neglected
your
bible
and
prayer
for
some
time
past
ellen
hardly
uttered
yes
why
my
child
i
do
know
said
ellen
weeping
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
made
me
think
myself
so
very
wicked
i
could
like
to
read
my
bible
or
pray
either
though
i
always
used
to
before
my
bible
lay
down
quite
at
the
bottom
of
my
trunk
and
i
even
did
like
to
raise
my
things
enough
to
see
the
cover
of
it
i
was
so
full
of
bad
feelings
i
did
feel
fit
to
pray
or
read
either
ah
that
is
the
way
with
the
wisest
of
us
said
her
companion
how
apt
we
are
to
shrink
most
from
our
physician
just
when
we
are
in
most
need
of
him
but
ellen
dear
that
is
right
no
hand
but
his
can
touch
that
sickness
you
are
complaining
of
seek
it
love
seek
it
he
will
hear
and
help
you
no
doubt
of
it
in
every
trouble
you
carry
simply
and
humbly
to
his
feet
he
has
you
know
ellen
was
weeping
very
much
but
less
bitterly
than
before
the
clouds
were
breaking
and
light
beginning
to
shine
through
shall
we
pray
together
now
said
her
companion
after
a
few
pause
oh
if
you
please
do
ellen
answered
through
her
tears
and
they
knelt
together
there
on
the
moss
beside
the
stone
where
ellen
head
rested
and
her
friend
folded
hands
were
laid
it
might
have
been
two
children
speaking
to
their
father
for
the
simplicity
of
that
prayer
difference
of
age
seemed
to
be
forgotten
and
what
suited
one
suited
the
other
it
was
not
without
difficulty
that
the
speaker
carried
it
calmly
through
for
ellen
sobs
went
nigh
to
check
her
more
than
once
when
they
rose
ellen
silently
sought
her
friend
arms
again
and
laying
her
face
on
her
shoulder
and
putting
both
arms
round
her
neck
she
wept
still
but
what
different
tears
it
was
like
the
gentle
rain
falling
through
sunshine
after
the
dark
cloud
and
the
thunder
and
the
hurricane
have
passed
by
and
they
kissed
each
other
before
either
of
them
spoke
you
will
not
forget
your
bible
and
prayer
again
ellen
oh
no
then
i
am
sure
you
will
find
your
causes
of
trouble
grow
less
i
will
not
hear
the
rest
of
them
now
in
a
day
or
two
i
hope
you
will
be
able
to
give
me
a
very
different
account
from
what
you
would
have
done
an
hour
ago
but
besides
that
it
is
getting
late
and
it
will
not
do
for
us
to
stay
too
long
up
here
you
have
a
good
way
to
go
to
reach
home
will
you
come
and
see
me
afternoon
oh
yes
indeed
i
will
if
i
can
and
if
you
will
tell
me
where
instead
of
turning
up
this
little
rocky
path
you
must
keep
straight
on
in
the
road
that
all
and
it
the
first
house
you
come
to
it
very
far
from
here
where
were
you
going
on
the
mountain
nowhere
have
you
been
any
higher
than
this
no
then
before
we
go
away
i
want
to
show
you
something
i
take
you
over
the
bridge
of
the
nose
it
is
but
a
step
or
two
more
a
little
rough
to
be
sure
but
you
must
mind
that
what
is
the
of
the
nose
said
ellen
as
they
left
her
and
began
to
toil
up
the
path
which
grew
more
steep
and
rocky
than
ever
you
know
this
mountain
is
called
the
nose
just
here
it
runs
out
to
a
very
thin
sharp
edge
we
shall
come
to
a
place
presently
where
you
turn
a
very
sharp
corner
to
get
from
one
side
of
the
hill
to
the
other
and
my
brother
named
it
jokingly
the
bridge
of
the
nose
why
do
they
give
the
mountain
such
a
queer
name
said
ellen
i
do
know
i
sure
the
people
say
that
from
one
point
of
view
this
side
of
it
looks
very
like
a
man
nose
but
i
never
could
find
it
out
and
have
some
doubt
about
the
fact
but
now
here
we
are
just
come
round
this
great
rock
mind
how
you
step
ellen
now
look
there
the
rock
they
had
just
turned
was
at
their
backs
and
they
looked
towards
the
west
both
exclaimed
at
the
beauty
before
them
the
view
was
not
so
extended
as
the
one
they
had
left
on
the
north
and
south
sides
the
broken
wavy
outline
of
mountains
closed
in
the
horizon
but
far
to
the
west
stretched
an
opening
between
the
hills
through
which
the
setting
sun
sent
his
long
beams
even
to
their
feet
in
the
distance
all
was
a
golden
haze
nearer
on
the
right
and
left
the
hills
were
lit
up
singularly
and
there
was
a
most
beautiful
mingling
of
deep
hazy
shadow
and
bright
glowing
mountain
sides
and
ridges
a
glory
was
upon
the
valley
far
down
below
at
their
feet
lay
a
large
lake
gleaming
in
the
sunlight
and
at
the
upper
end
of
it
a
village
of
some
size
showed
like
a
cluster
of
white
dots
how
beautiful
said
the
lady
again
ellen
dear
he
whose
hand
raised
up
those
mountains
and
has
painted
them
so
gloriously
is
the
very
same
one
who
has
said
to
you
and
to
me
and
it
shall
be
given
you
ellen
looked
up
their
eyes
met
her
answer
was
in
that
grateful
glance
the
lady
sat
down
and
drew
ellen
close
to
her
do
you
see
that
little
white
village
yonder
down
at
the
far
end
of
the
lake
that
is
the
village
of
and
that
is
lake
that
is
where
i
go
to
church
you
can
not
see
the
little
church
from
here
my
father
preaches
there
every
sunday
morning
you
must
have
a
long
way
to
go
said
ellen
yes
a
pretty
long
way
but
it
very
pleasant
though
i
mount
my
little
grey
pony
and
he
carries
me
there
in
quick
time
when
i
will
let
him
i
never
wish
the
way
shorter
i
go
in
all
sorts
of
weathers
too
ellen
sharp
and
i
do
mind
frost
and
snow
who
is
sharp
said
ellen
my
pony
an
odd
name
is
it
it
was
of
my
choosing
ellen
but
he
deserves
it
if
ever
pony
did
he
a
very
cunning
little
fellow
where
do
you
go
ellen
to
thirlwall
to
church
i
do
go
anywhere
does
your
aunt
go
to
church
she
has
since
i
have
been
here
what
do
you
do
with
yourself
on
sunday
nothing
i
do
know
what
to
do
with
myself
all
the
day
long
i
get
tired
of
being
in
the
house
and
i
go
out
of
doors
and
then
i
get
tired
of
being
out
of
doors
and
come
in
again
i
wanted
a
kitten
dreadfully
but
van
brunt
said
aunt
fortune
would
not
let
me
keep
one
did
you
want
a
kitten
to
help
you
keep
sunday
ellen
said
her
friend
smiling
yes
i
did
said
ellen
smiling
again
i
thought
it
would
be
a
great
deal
of
company
for
me
i
got
very
tired
of
reading
all
day
long
and
i
had
nothing
to
read
but
the
bible
and
you
know
i
told
you
i
have
been
all
wrong
ever
since
i
came
here
and
i
did
like
to
read
that
much
my
poor
child
said
the
lady
you
have
been
hardly
bestead
i
think
what
if
you
were
to
come
and
spend
next
sunday
with
me
do
you
think
i
should
do
instead
of
a
kitten
oh
yes
i
am
sure
of
it
said
ellen
clinging
to
her
oh
come
gladly
if
you
will
let
me
and
if
aunt
fortune
will
let
me
and
i
hope
she
will
for
she
said
last
sunday
i
was
the
plague
of
her
life
what
did
you
do
to
make
her
say
so
said
her
friend
gravely
only
asked
her
for
some
books
well
my
dear
i
see
i
am
getting
upon
another
of
your
troubles
and
we
have
time
for
that
now
by
your
own
account
you
have
been
much
in
fault
yourself
and
i
trust
you
will
find
all
things
mend
with
your
own
mending
but
now
there
goes
the
sun
and
you
and
i
must
follow
his
example
the
lake
ceased
to
gleam
and
the
houses
of
the
village
were
less
plainly
to
be
seen
still
the
mountain
heads
were
as
bright
as
ever
gradually
the
shadows
crept
up
their
sides
while
the
grey
of
evening
settled
deeper
and
deeper
upon
the
valley
there
said
ellen
that
just
what
i
was
wondering
at
the
other
morning
only
then
the
light
shone
upon
the
top
of
the
mountains
first
and
walked
down
and
now
it
leaves
the
bottom
first
and
walks
up
i
asked
van
brunt
about
it
and
he
could
not
tell
me
that
another
of
my
troubles
there
nobody
that
can
tell
me
anything
put
me
in
mind
of
it
and
i
try
to
make
you
understand
it
said
the
lady
but
we
must
not
tarry
now
i
see
you
are
likely
to
find
me
work
enough
ellen
i
not
ask
you
a
question
if
you
do
like
it
said
ellen
earnestly
i
do
like
i
do
like
said
the
other
i
spoke
laughingly
for
i
see
you
will
be
apt
to
ask
me
a
good
many
as
many
as
you
please
my
dear
thank
you
said
ellen
as
they
ran
down
the
hill
they
keep
coming
into
my
head
all
the
while
it
was
easier
going
down
than
coming
up
they
soon
arrived
at
the
place
where
ellen
had
left
the
road
to
take
the
here
we
part
said
the
lady
there
was
a
kiss
and
a
squeeze
of
the
hand
but
when
ellen
would
have
turned
away
the
lady
still
held
her
fast
you
are
an
odd
little
girl
said
she
i
gave
you
liberty
to
ask
me
questions
yes
said
ellen
doubtfully
there
is
a
question
you
have
not
asked
me
that
i
have
been
expecting
do
you
know
who
i
am
no
do
you
want
to
know
yes
very
much
said
ellen
laughing
at
her
friend
look
but
mamma
told
me
never
to
try
to
find
out
anything
about
other
people
that
they
did
wish
me
to
know
or
that
was
my
business
well
i
think
this
is
your
business
decidedly
who
are
you
going
to
ask
for
when
you
come
to
see
me
will
you
ask
for
young
lady
that
lives
in
this
house
or
will
you
give
a
description
of
my
nose
and
eyes
and
inches
ellen
laughed
my
dear
ellen
said
the
lady
changing
her
tone
do
you
know
you
please
me
very
much
for
one
person
that
shows
herself
in
this
matter
there
are
a
thousand
i
think
that
ask
impertinent
questions
i
am
very
glad
you
are
an
exception
to
the
common
rule
but
dear
ellen
i
am
quite
willing
you
should
know
my
name
it
is
alice
humphreys
now
kiss
me
again
and
run
home
it
is
quite
quite
time
i
have
kept
you
too
late
my
dear
tell
your
aunt
i
beg
she
will
allow
you
to
take
tea
with
me
they
parted
and
ellen
hastened
homewards
urged
by
the
dusk
of
the
evening
she
trod
the
green
turf
with
a
step
lighter
and
quicker
than
it
had
been
a
few
hours
before
and
she
regained
her
home
in
much
less
time
than
it
had
taken
her
to
come
from
thence
to
the
mountain
lights
were
in
the
kitchen
and
the
table
set
but
though
weary
and
faint
she
was
willing
to
forego
her
supper
rather
than
meet
her
aunt
just
then
so
she
stole
quietly
up
to
her
room
she
did
not
forget
her
friend
advice
she
had
no
light
she
could
not
read
but
ellen
did
pray
she
did
carry
all
her
her
wants
and
her
woes
to
that
friend
whose
ear
is
always
open
to
hear
the
cry
of
those
who
call
upon
him
in
truth
and
then
relieved
refreshed
almost
healed
she
went
to
bed
and
slept
sweetly
chapter
xvi
after
long
storms
and
tempests
overblowne
the
sunne
at
length
his
joyous
face
doth
cleare
so
when
as
fortune
all
her
spight
hath
showne
some
blissfull
houres
at
last
must
needs
appeare
else
should
afflicted
wights
despeire
faërie
queene
early
next
morning
ellen
awoke
with
a
sense
that
something
pleasant
had
happened
then
the
joyful
reality
darted
into
her
mind
and
jumping
out
of
bed
she
set
about
her
morning
work
with
a
better
heart
than
she
had
been
able
to
bring
to
it
for
many
a
long
day
when
she
had
finished
she
went
to
the
window
she
had
found
out
how
to
keep
it
open
now
by
means
of
a
big
nail
stuck
in
a
hole
under
the
sash
it
was
very
early
and
in
the
perfect
stillness
the
soft
gurgle
of
the
little
brook
came
distinctly
to
her
ear
ellen
leaned
her
arms
on
the
and
tasted
the
morning
air
almost
wondering
at
its
sweetness
and
at
the
loveliness
of
field
and
sky
and
the
bright
eastern
horizon
for
days
and
days
all
had
looked
dark
and
sad
there
were
two
reasons
for
the
change
in
the
first
place
ellen
had
made
up
her
mind
to
go
straight
on
in
the
path
of
duty
in
the
second
place
she
had
found
a
friend
her
little
heart
bounded
with
delight
and
swelled
with
thankfulness
at
the
thought
of
alice
humphreys
she
was
once
more
at
peace
with
herself
and
had
even
some
notion
of
being
at
peace
with
her
aunt
though
a
sad
twinge
came
over
her
whenever
she
thought
of
her
mother
letter
but
there
is
only
one
way
for
me
she
thought
i
do
as
that
dear
miss
humphreys
told
me
it
good
and
early
and
i
shall
have
a
fine
time
before
breakfast
yet
to
myself
and
i
get
up
so
every
morning
and
have
it
that
be
the
very
best
plan
i
can
hit
upon
as
she
thought
this
she
drew
forth
her
bible
from
its
place
at
the
bottom
of
her
trunk
and
opening
it
at
hazard
she
began
to
read
the
chapter
of
matthew
some
of
it
she
did
not
quite
understand
but
she
paused
with
pleasure
at
the
verse
that
means
me
she
thought
the
and
verses
struck
her
a
good
deal
but
when
she
came
to
the
last
she
was
almost
startled
there
it
is
again
she
said
that
is
exactly
what
that
gentleman
said
to
me
i
thought
i
was
forgiven
but
how
can
i
be
for
i
feel
i
have
not
forgiven
aunt
fortune
laying
aside
her
book
ellen
kneeled
down
but
this
one
thought
so
pressed
upon
her
mind
that
she
could
think
of
scarce
anything
else
and
her
prayer
this
morning
was
an
urgent
and
repeated
petition
that
she
might
be
enabled
from
her
heart
to
forgive
her
aunt
fortune
all
her
trespasses
poor
ellen
she
felt
it
was
very
hard
work
at
the
very
minute
she
was
striving
to
feel
at
peace
with
her
aunt
one
grievance
after
another
would
start
up
to
remembrance
and
she
knew
the
feelings
that
met
them
were
far
enough
from
the
spirit
of
forgiveness
in
the
midst
of
this
she
was
called
down
she
rose
with
tears
in
her
eyes
and
what
shall
i
do
in
her
heart
bowing
her
head
once
more
she
earnestly
prayed
that
if
she
could
not
yet
right
towards
her
aunt
she
might
be
kept
at
least
from
acting
or
speaking
wrong
poor
ellen
in
the
heart
is
the
spring
of
action
and
she
found
it
so
this
morning
her
aunt
and
van
brunt
were
already
at
the
table
ellen
took
her
place
in
silence
for
one
look
at
her
aunt
face
told
her
that
no
would
be
accepted
miss
fortune
was
in
a
particularly
bad
humour
owing
among
other
things
to
van
brunt
having
refused
to
eat
his
breakfast
unless
ellen
were
called
an
unlucky
piece
of
kindness
she
neither
spoke
to
ellen
nor
looked
at
her
van
brunt
did
what
in
him
lay
to
make
amends
he
helped
her
very
carefully
to
the
cold
pork
and
potatoes
and
handed
her
the
platter
of
here
the
first
buckwheats
of
the
season
said
he
and
i
told
miss
fortune
i
war
agoing
to
eat
one
on
if
you
did
come
down
to
enjoy
along
with
us
take
two
take
two
you
want
to
keep
each
other
hot
ellen
look
and
smile
thanked
him
as
following
his
advice
she
covered
one
generous
buckwheat
with
another
as
ample
that
the
thing
now
here
some
prime
maple
you
like
i
guess
do
you
i
do
know
yet
i
have
never
seen
any
said
ellen
never
seen
buckwheats
why
they
as
good
as
my
splitters
buckwheat
cakes
and
maple
molasses
that
food
fit
for
a
king
think
when
they
good
and
miss
fortune
always
miss
fortune
did
not
relent
at
all
at
this
compliment
what
makes
you
so
white
this
morning
van
brunt
presently
went
on
you
ai
well
be
you
yes
said
ellen
doubtfully
i
well
she
as
well
as
i
am
van
brunt
if
you
do
go
and
put
her
up
to
any
notions
miss
fortune
said
in
a
kind
of
choked
voice
van
brunt
hemmed
and
said
no
more
to
the
end
of
ellen
rather
dreaded
what
was
to
come
next
for
her
aunt
look
was
ominous
in
dead
silence
the
things
were
put
away
and
put
up
and
in
course
of
washing
and
drying
when
miss
fortune
suddenly
broke
forth
what
did
you
do
with
yourself
yesterday
afternoon
i
was
up
on
the
mountain
said
ellen
what
mountain
i
believe
they
call
it
nose
what
business
had
you
up
there
i
had
any
business
there
what
did
you
go
there
for
nothing
nothing
you
expect
me
to
believe
that
you
call
yourself
a
i
suppose
mamma
used
to
say
i
was
said
poor
ellen
striving
to
swallow
her
feelings
your
mother
i
dare
say
mothers
always
are
blind
i
dare
say
she
took
every
thing
you
said
for
gospel
ellen
was
silent
from
sheer
want
of
words
that
were
pointed
enough
to
suit
her
i
wish
morgan
could
have
had
the
gumption
to
marry
in
his
own
country
but
he
must
go
running
after
a
scotch
woman
a
yankee
would
have
brought
up
his
child
to
be
worth
something
give
me
yankees
ellen
set
down
the
cup
she
was
wiping
you
do
know
anything
about
my
mother
she
said
you
ought
to
speak
so
it
not
right
why
ai
it
right
i
should
like
to
know
said
miss
fortune

is
a
free
country
i
guess
our
tongues
ai
tied

all
free
here
i
wish
we
were
muttered
ellen
i
know
what
i
do
what
would
you
do
said
miss
fortune
ellen
was
silent
her
aunt
repeated
the
question
in
a
sharper
tone
i
ought
to
say
what
i
was
going
to
said
ellen
i
rather
not
i
do
care
said
miss
fortune
you
began
and
you
shall
finish
it
i
will
hear
what
it
was
i
was
going
to
say
if
we
were
all
free
i
would
run
away
well
that
a
beautiful
speech
i
am
glad
to
have
heard
it
i
admire
it
very
much
now
what
were
you
doing
yesterday
up
on
the
nose
please
to
go
on
wiping
there
a
pile
ready
for
you
what
were
you
doing
yesterday
afternoon
ellen
hesitated
were
you
alone
or
with
somebody
i
was
alone
part
of
the
time
and
who
were
you
with
the
rest
of
the
time
miss
humphreys
miss
humphreys
what
were
you
doing
with
her
talking
did
you
ever
see
her
before
no
where
did
you
find
her
she
found
me
up
on
the
hill
what
were
you
talking
about
ellen
was
silent
what
were
you
talking
about
repeated
miss
fortune
i
had
rather
not
tell
and
i
had
rather
you
tell
so
out
with
it
i
was
alone
with
miss
humphreys
said
ellen
and
it
is
no
matter
what
we
were
talking
about
it
does
concern
anybody
but
her
and
me
yes
it
does
it
concerns
me
said
her
aunt
and
i
choose
to
know
what
were
you
talking
about
ellen
was
silent
will
you
tell
me
no
said
ellen
low
but
resolutely
i
vow
you
enough
to
try
the
patience
of
job
look
here
said
miss
fortune
setting
down
what
she
had
in
her
hands
i
know
i
care
what
it
was
but
you
shall
tell
me
or
i
find
a
way
to
make
you
i
give
you
such
a
stop
stop
said
ellen
wildly
you
must
not
speak
to
me
so
mamma
never
did
and
you
have
no
to
if
mamma
or
papa
were
here
you
would
not
talk
to
me
so
the
answer
to
this
was
a
sharp
box
on
the
ear
from
miss
fortune
wet
hand
half
stunned
less
by
the
blow
than
the
tumult
of
feeling
it
roused
ellen
stood
a
moment
and
then
throwing
down
her
towel
she
ran
out
of
the
room
shivering
with
passion
and
brushing
off
the
soapy
water
left
on
her
face
as
if
it
had
been
her
aunt
very
hand
violent
tears
burst
forth
as
soon
as
she
reached
her
own
room
tears
at
first
of
anger
and
mortification
only
but
conscience
presently
began
to
whisper
you
are
wrong
you
are
wrong
and
tears
of
sorrow
mingled
with
the
others
oh
said
ellen
why
could
i
keep
still
when
i
had
resolved
so
this
morning
why
could
i
be
quiet
but
she
ought
not
to
have
provoked
me
so
dreadfully
i
could
help
it
you
are
wrong
said
conscience
again
and
her
tears
flowed
faster
and
then
came
back
her
morning
trouble
the
duty
and
the
difficulty
of
forgiving
forgive
her
aunt
fortune
with
her
whole
heart
in
a
passion
of
displeasure
against
her
alas
ellen
began
to
feel
and
acknowledge
that
indeed
all
was
wrong
but
what
to
do
there
was
just
one
comfort
the
visit
to
miss
humphreys
in
the
afternoon
she
will
tell
me
thought
ellen
she
will
help
me
but
in
the
meanwhile
ellen
had
not
much
time
to
think
her
aunt
called
her
down
and
set
her
to
work
she
was
very
busy
till
and
very
unhappy
but
twenty
times
in
the
course
of
the
morning
did
ellen
pause
for
a
moment
and
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
pray
that
a
heart
to
forgive
might
be
given
her
as
soon
as
possible
after
dinner
she
made
her
escape
to
her
room
that
she
might
prepare
for
her
walk
conscience
was
not
quite
easy
that
she
was
going
without
the
knowledge
of
her
aunt
she
had
debated
the
question
with
herself
and
could
not
make
up
her
mind
to
hazard
losing
her
visit
so
she
dressed
herself
very
carefully
one
of
her
dark
merinos
was
affectionately
put
on
her
single
pair
of
white
stockings
shoes
ruffle
cape
ellen
saw
that
all
was
faultlessly
neat
just
as
her
mother
used
to
have
it
and
the
nice
blue
hood
lay
upon
the
bed
ready
to
be
put
on
the
last
thing
when
she
heard
her
aunt
voice
calling
ellen
come
down
and
do
your
ironing
right
away
now
the
irons
are
hot
for
one
moment
ellen
stood
still
in
dismay
then
slowly
undressed
dressed
again
and
went
downstairs
come
you
been
an
age
said
miss
fortune
now
make
haste
there
ai
but
a
handful
and
i
want
to
mop
up
ellen
took
courage
again
ironed
away
with
right
good
will
and
as
there
was
really
but
a
handful
of
things
she
had
soon
done
even
to
taking
off
the
ironing
blanket
and
putting
up
the
irons
in
the
meantime
she
had
changed
her
mind
as
to
stealing
off
without
leave
conscience
was
too
strong
for
her
and
though
with
a
beating
heart
she
told
of
miss
humphreys
desire
and
her
half
engagement
you
may
go
where
you
like
i
am
sure
i
do
not
care
what
you
do
with
yourself
was
miss
fortune
reply
full
of
delight
at
this
ungracious
permission
ellen
fled
upstairs
and
dressing
much
quicker
than
before
was
soon
on
her
way
but
at
first
she
went
rather
sadly
in
spite
of
all
her
good
resolves
and
wishes
everything
that
day
had
gone
wrong
and
ellen
felt
that
the
root
of
the
evil
was
in
her
own
heart
some
tears
fell
as
she
walked
farther
from
her
aunt
house
however
her
spirits
began
to
rise
her
foot
fell
lighter
on
the
green
sward
hope
and
expectation
quickened
her
steps
and
when
at
length
she
passed
the
little
it
was
almost
on
a
run
not
very
far
beyond
that
her
glad
eyes
saw
the
house
she
was
in
quest
of
it
was
a
large
white
house
not
very
white
either
for
its
last
dress
of
paint
had
grown
old
long
ago
it
stood
close
by
the
road
and
the
trees
of
the
wood
seemed
to
throng
it
round
on
every
side
ellen
mounted
the
few
steps
that
led
to
the
front
door
and
knocked
but
as
she
could
only
just
reach
the
high
knocker
she
was
not
likely
to
alarm
anybody
with
the
noise
she
made
after
a
great
many
little
faint
raps
which
if
anybody
heard
them
might
easily
have
been
mistaken
for
the
attacks
of
some
rat
teeth
upon
the
wainscot
ellen
grew
weary
of
her
fruitless
toil
of
standing
on
tiptoe
and
resolved
though
doubtfully
to
go
round
the
house
and
see
if
there
was
any
other
way
of
getting
in
turning
the
far
corner
she
saw
a
long
low
outbuilding
or
shed
jutting
out
from
the
side
of
the
house
on
the
farther
side
of
this
ellen
found
an
elderly
woman
standing
in
front
of
the
shed
which
was
there
open
and
paved
and
wringing
some
clothes
out
of
a
tub
of
water
she
was
a
pleasant
woman
to
look
at
very
trim
and
tidy
and
a
eye
and
smile
when
she
saw
ellen
ellen
made
up
to
her
and
asked
for
miss
humphreys
why
where
in
the
world
did
you
come
from
said
the
woman
i
receive
company
at
the
back
of
the
house
i
knocked
at
the
front
door
till
i
was
tired
said
ellen
smiling
in
return
miss
alice
must
ha
been
asleep
now
honey
you
have
come
so
far
round
to
find
me
will
you
go
a
little
farther
and
find
miss
alice
just
go
round
this
corner
and
keep
straight
along
till
you
come
to
the
glass
door
there
you
find
her
stop
maybe
she
asleep
i
may
as
well
go
along
with
you
myself
she
wrung
the
water
from
her
hands
and
led
the
way
a
little
space
of
green
grass
stretched
in
front
of
the
shed
and
ellen
found
it
extended
all
along
that
side
of
the
house
like
a
very
narrow
lawn
at
the
edge
of
it
shot
up
the
high
forest
trees
nothing
between
them
and
the
house
but
the
smooth
grass
and
a
narrow
worn
footpath
the
woods
were
now
all
brown
stems
except
here
and
there
a
superb
hemlock
and
some
scattered
silvery
birches
but
the
grass
was
still
green
and
the
last
day
of
the
indian
summer
hung
its
soft
veil
over
all
the
foliage
of
the
forest
was
hardly
missed
they
passed
another
hall
door
opposite
the
one
where
ellen
had
tried
her
strength
and
patience
upon
the
knocker
a
little
farther
on
they
paused
at
the
glass
door
one
step
led
to
it
ellen
conductress
looked
in
first
through
one
of
the
panes
and
then
opening
the
door
motioned
her
to
enter
here
you
are
my
new
acquaintance
said
alice
smiling
and
kissing
her
i
began
to
think
something
was
the
matter
you
tarried
so
late
we
do
keep
fashionable
hours
in
the
country
you
know
but
i
very
glad
to
see
you
take
off
your
things
and
lay
them
on
that
settee
by
the
door
you
see
i
a
settee
for
summer
and
a
sofa
for
winter
for
here
i
am
in
this
room
at
all
times
of
the
year
and
a
very
pleasant
room
i
think
it
do
you
yes
indeed
i
do
said
ellen
pulling
off
her
last
glove
ah
but
wait
till
you
have
taken
tea
with
me
times
and
then
see
if
you
do
say
it
is
pleasant
nothing
can
be
so
pleasant
that
is
quite
new
but
now
come
here
and
look
out
of
this
window
or
door
whichever
you
choose
to
call
it
do
you
see
what
a
beautiful
view
i
have
here
the
wood
was
just
as
thick
all
along
as
it
is
on
the
right
and
left
i
felt
half
smothered
to
be
so
shut
in
so
i
got
my
brother
and
thomas
to
take
axes
and
go
to
work
there
and
many
a
large
tree
they
cut
down
for
me
till
you
see
they
opened
a
way
through
the
woods
for
the
view
of
that
beautiful
stretch
of
country
i
should
grow
melancholy
if
i
had
that
wall
of
trees
pressing
on
my
vision
all
the
time
it
always
comforts
me
to
look
off
far
away
to
those
distant
blue
hills
are
those
the
hills
i
was
looking
at
yesterday
said
ellen
from
up
on
the
mountain
the
very
same
this
is
part
of
the
very
same
view
and
a
noble
view
it
is
every
morning
ellen
the
sun
rising
behind
those
hills
shines
in
through
this
door
and
lights
up
my
room
and
in
winter
he
looks
in
at
that
south
window
so
i
have
him
all
the
time
to
be
sure
if
i
want
to
see
him
set
i
must
take
a
walk
for
it
but
that
is
unpleasant
and
you
know
we
can
not
have
everything
at
once
it
was
a
very
beautiful
extent
of
woodland
meadow
and
hill
that
was
seen
through
the
gap
cut
in
the
forest
the
wall
of
trees
on
each
side
serving
as
a
frame
to
shut
it
in
and
the
descent
of
the
mountain
from
almost
the
edge
of
the
lawn
being
very
rapid
the
opening
had
been
skilfully
cut
the
effect
was
remarkable
and
very
fine
the
light
on
the
picture
being
often
quite
different
from
that
on
the
frame
or
on
the
hither
side
of
the
frame
now
ellen
said
alice
turning
from
the
window
take
a
good
look
at
my
room
i
want
you
to
know
it
and
feel
at
home
in
it
for
whenever
you
can
run
away
from
your
aunt
this
is
your
home
do
you
understand
a
smile
was
on
each
face
ellen
felt
that
she
was
understanding
it
very
fast
here
next
the
door
you
see
is
my
summer
settee
and
in
summer
it
very
often
walks
out
of
doors
to
accommodate
people
on
the
grass
plat
i
have
a
great
fancy
for
taking
tea
out
of
doors
ellen
in
warm
weather
and
if
you
do
not
mind
a
mosquito
or
two
i
shall
be
always
happy
to
have
your
company
that
door
opens
into
the
hall
look
out
and
see
for
i
want
you
to
get
the
geography
of
the
house
that
lumbering
painted
concern
is
my
cabinet
of
curiosities
i
tried
my
best
to
make
the
carpenter
man
at
thirlwall
understand
what
sort
of
a
thing
i
wanted
and
did
all
but
show
him
how
to
make
it
but
as
the
southerners
say
has
made
it
right
no
how
there
i
keep
my
dried
flowers
my
minerals
and
a
very
odd
collection
of
curious
things
of
all
sorts
that
i
am
constantly
picking
up
i
show
you
them
some
day
ellen
have
you
a
fancy
for
curiosities
yes
i
believe
so
believe
so
not
more
sure
than
that
are
you
a
lover
of
dead
moths
and
empty
and
butterflies
wings
and
dry
tufts
of
moss
and
curious
stones
and
pieces
of
and
strange
nests
these
are
some
of
the
things
i
used
to
delight
in
when
i
was
about
as
old
as
you
i
do
know
said
ellen
i
never
was
where
i
could
get
them
were
you
poor
child
then
you
have
been
shut
up
to
brick
walls
and
all
your
life
yes
all
my
life
but
now
you
have
seen
a
little
of
the
country
do
you
think
you
shall
like
it
better
oh
a
great
deal
better
ah
that
right
i
am
sure
you
will
on
that
other
side
you
see
is
my
winter
sofa
it
a
very
comfortable
i
can
tell
you
ellen
as
i
have
proved
by
many
a
sweet
nap
and
its
old
chintz
covers
are
very
pleasant
to
me
for
i
remember
them
as
far
back
as
i
remember
anything
there
was
a
sigh
here
but
alice
passed
on
and
opened
a
door
near
the
end
of
the
sofa
look
in
here
ellen
this
is
my
bedroom
oh
how
lovely
ellen
exclaimed
the
carpet
covered
only
the
middle
of
the
floor
the
rest
was
painted
white
the
furniture
was
common
but
neat
as
wax
ample
curtains
of
white
dimity
clothed
the
three
windows
and
lightly
draped
the
bed
the
was
covered
with
muslin
and
by
the
toilet
cushion
stood
late
as
it
was
a
glass
of
flowers
ellen
thought
it
must
be
a
pleasure
to
sleep
there
this
said
alice
when
they
came
out
between
my
door
and
the
fireplace
is
a
cupboard
here
be
cups
and
saucers
and
so
forth
in
that
other
corner
beyond
the
fireplace
you
see
my
do
you
love
flowers
ellen
i
love
them
dearly
miss
alice
i
have
some
pretty
ones
out
yet
and
shall
have
one
or
two
in
the
winter
but
i
ca
keep
a
great
many
here
i
have
room
for
them
i
have
hard
work
to
save
these
from
frost
there
a
beautiful
daphne
that
will
be
out
and
make
the
whole
house
sweet
but
here
ellen
on
this
side
between
the
windows
is
my
greatest
treasure
my
precious
books
all
these
are
mine
now
my
dear
it
is
time
to
introduce
you
to
my
most
excellent
of
easy
chairs
the
best
things
in
the
room
they
put
yourself
in
that
now
do
you
feel
at
home
very
much
indeed
said
ellen
laughing
as
alice
placed
her
in
the
deep
easy
chair
there
were
two
things
in
the
room
that
alice
had
not
mentioned
and
while
she
mended
the
fire
ellen
looked
at
them
one
was
the
portrait
of
a
gentleman
grave
and
this
had
very
little
of
her
attention
the
other
was
the
counter
portrait
of
a
lady
a
fine
dignified
countenance
that
had
a
charm
for
ellen
it
hung
over
the
fireplace
in
an
excellent
light
and
the
mild
eye
and
somewhat
of
a
peculiar
expression
about
the
mouth
bore
such
likeness
to
alice
though
older
that
ellen
had
no
doubt
whose
it
was
alice
presently
drew
a
chair
close
to
ellen
side
and
kissed
her
i
trust
my
child
she
said
that
you
feel
better
than
you
did
yesterday
oh
i
do
a
great
deal
better
ellen
answered
then
i
hope
the
reason
is
that
you
have
returned
to
your
duty
and
are
resolved
not
to
be
a
christian
but
to
lead
a
life
now
i
have
resolved
so
i
did
resolve
so
last
night
and
this
morning
but
yet
i
have
been
doing
nothing
but
wrong
all
alice
was
silent
ellen
lips
quivered
for
a
moment
and
then
she
went
on
oh
how
i
have
wanted
to
see
you
to
tell
me
what
i
do
i
resolved
and
resolved
this
morning
and
then
as
soon
as
i
got
downstairs
i
began
to
have
bad
feelings
towards
aunt
fortune
and
i
have
been
full
of
bad
feelings
all
day
and
i
could
help
it
it
will
not
do
to
say
that
we
can
not
help
what
is
wrong
ellen
what
is
the
reason
that
you
have
bad
feelings
towards
your
aunt
she
do
like
me
but
how
happens
that
ellen
i
am
afraid
you
do
like
her
no
i
do
to
be
sure
how
can
i
why
can
not
you
ellen
oh
i
ca
i
wish
i
could
but
oh
i
should
have
liked
her
i
might
have
liked
her
if
she
had
been
kind
but
she
never
has
even
that
first
night
i
came
she
never
kissed
me
nor
said
she
was
glad
to
see
me
that
was
failing
in
kindness
certainly
but
is
she
to
you
ellen
oh
yes
indeed
she
is
she
talks
to
me
and
talks
to
me
in
a
way
that
almost
drives
me
out
of
my
wits
and
she
even
struck
me
she
has
no
right
to
do
it
said
ellen
firing
with
passion
she
has
no
to
and
she
has
no
right
to
talk
as
she
does
about
mamma
she
did
it
and
she
has
done
it
before
i
ca
bear
it
and
i
bear
i
ca
her
hush
hush
said
alice
drawing
the
excited
child
to
her
arms
for
ellen
had
risen
from
her
seat
you
must
not
talk
so
ellen
you
are
not
feeling
right
now
no
i
am
not
said
ellen
coldly
and
sadly
she
sat
a
moment
and
then
turning
to
her
companion
put
both
arms
round
her
neck
and
hid
her
face
on
her
shoulder
again
and
without
raising
it
she
gave
her
the
history
of
the
morning
what
has
brought
about
this
dreadful
state
of
things
said
alice
after
a
few
minutes
whose
fault
is
it
ellen
i
think
it
is
aunt
fortune
fault
said
ellen
raising
her
head
i
do
think
it
is
mine
if
she
had
behaved
well
to
me
i
should
have
behaved
well
to
her
i
meant
to
i
am
sure
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
do
not
think
you
have
been
in
fault
at
all
in
the
matter
no
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
i
have
been
very
much
in
fault
very
often
i
know
that
i
get
very
angry
and
vexed
and
sometimes
i
say
nothing
but
sometimes
i
get
out
of
all
patience
and
say
things
i
ought
not
i
did
so
but
it
is
so
very
hard
to
keep
still
when
i
am
in
such
a
passion
and
now
i
have
got
to
feel
so
towards
aunt
fortune
that
i
do
like
the
sight
of
her
i
hate
the
very
look
of
her
bonnet
hanging
up
on
the
wall
i
know
it
is
right
and
it
makes
me
miserable
and
i
ca
help
it
for
i
grow
worse
and
worse
every
day
and
what
shall
i
do
ellen
tears
came
faster
than
her
words
ellen
my
child
said
alice
after
a
while
there
is
but
one
way
you
know
what
i
said
to
you
yesterday
i
know
it
but
dear
miss
alice
in
my
reading
this
morning
i
came
to
that
verse
that
speaks
about
not
being
forgiven
if
we
do
not
forgive
others
and
oh
how
it
troubles
me
for
i
ca
feel
that
i
forgive
aunt
fortune
i
feel
vexed
whenever
the
thought
of
her
comes
into
my
head
and
how
can
i
behave
right
to
her
while
i
feel
so
you
are
right
there
my
dear
you
can
not
indeed
the
heart
must
be
set
right
before
the
life
can
be
but
what
shall
i
do
to
set
it
right
pray
dear
miss
alice
i
have
been
praying
all
this
morning
that
i
might
forgive
aunt
fortune
and
yet
i
can
not
do
it
pray
still
my
dear
said
alice
pressing
her
closer
in
her
arms
pray
still
if
you
are
in
earnest
the
answer
will
come
but
there
is
something
else
you
can
do
and
must
do
ellen
besides
praying
or
praying
may
be
in
vain
what
do
you
mean
miss
alice
you
acknowledge
yourself
in
fault
have
you
made
all
the
amends
you
can
have
you
as
soon
as
you
have
seen
yourself
in
the
wrong
gone
to
your
aunt
fortune
and
acknowledged
it
and
humbly
asked
her
pardon
ellen
answered
no
in
a
low
voice
then
my
child
your
duty
is
plain
before
you
the
next
thing
after
doing
wrong
is
to
make
all
the
amends
in
your
power
confess
your
fault
and
ask
forgiveness
both
of
god
and
man
pride
struggles
against
it
i
see
yours
does
but
my
child
resisteth
the
proud
but
giveth
grace
unto
the
humble
ellen
burst
into
tears
and
cried
heartily
mind
your
own
wrong
doings
my
child
and
you
will
not
be
half
so
disposed
to
quarrel
with
those
of
other
people
but
ellen
dear
if
you
will
not
humble
yourself
to
this
you
must
not
count
upon
an
answer
to
your
prayer
thou
bring
thy
gift
to
the
altar
and
there
rememberest
that
thy
brother
had
aught
against
thee
what
then
there
thy
gift
before
the
altar
go
first
and
be
reconciled
to
thy
brother
and
then
come
but
it
is
so
hard
to
forgive
sobbed
ellen
hard
yes
it
is
hard
when
our
hearts
are
so
but
there
is
little
love
to
christ
and
no
just
sense
of
his
love
to
us
in
the
heart
that
finds
it
hard
pride
and
selfishness
make
it
hard
the
heart
full
of
love
to
the
dear
saviour
lay
up
offences
against
itself
i
have
said
quite
enough
said
alice
after
a
pause
you
know
what
you
want
my
dear
ellen
and
what
you
ought
to
do
i
shall
leave
you
for
a
little
while
to
change
my
dress
for
i
have
been
walking
and
riding
all
the
morning
make
a
good
use
of
the
time
while
i
am
gone
ellen
did
make
good
use
of
the
time
when
alice
returned
she
met
her
with
another
face
than
she
had
worn
all
that
day
humbler
and
quieter
and
flinging
her
arms
around
her
she
said
i
will
ask
aunt
fortune
forgiveness
i
feel
i
can
do
it
now
and
how
about
ellen
i
think
god
will
help
me
to
forgive
her
said
ellen
i
have
asked
him
at
any
rate
i
will
ask
her
to
forgive
me
but
oh
miss
alice
what
would
have
become
of
me
without
you
do
lean
upon
me
dear
ellen
remember
you
have
a
better
friend
than
i
always
near
you
trust
in
him
if
i
have
done
you
any
good
forget
it
was
he
brought
me
to
you
yesterday
afternoon
there
just
one
thing
that
troubles
me
now
said
ellen
letter
i
am
thinking
of
it
all
the
time
i
feel
as
if
i
should
fly
to
get
it
we
see
about
that
can
not
you
ask
your
aunt
for
it
i
do
like
to
take
care
ellen
there
is
some
pride
there
yet
well
i
will
try
said
ellen
but
sometimes
i
know
she
would
not
give
it
to
me
if
i
were
to
ask
her
but
i
try
if
i
can
well
now
to
change
the
subject
at
what
did
you
dine
i
do
know
at
the
same
time
we
always
do
i
believe
and
that
is
twelve
is
it
yes
but
i
was
so
full
of
coming
here
and
other
things
that
i
could
eat
then
i
suppose
you
would
have
no
objection
to
an
early
tea
no
whenever
you
please
said
ellen
laughing
i
shall
please
it
pretty
soon
i
have
had
no
dinner
at
all
ellen
i
have
been
out
and
about
all
the
morning
and
had
just
taken
a
little
nap
when
you
came
in
come
this
way
and
let
me
show
you
some
of
my
housekeeping
she
led
the
way
across
the
hall
to
the
room
on
the
opposite
side
a
large
and
kitchen
ellen
could
not
help
exclaiming
at
its
pleasantness
why
yes
i
think
it
is
i
have
been
in
many
a
parlour
that
i
do
not
like
as
well
beyond
this
is
a
lower
kitchen
where
margery
does
all
her
rough
work
nothing
comes
up
the
steps
that
lead
from
that
to
this
but
the
very
nicest
and
daintiest
of
kitchen
matters
margery
is
my
father
gone
to
thirlwall
no
miss
alice
he
at
thomas
heard
him
say
he
be
back
early
well
i
shall
not
wait
for
him
margery
if
you
will
put
the
kettle
on
and
see
to
the
fire
i
make
some
of
my
cakes
for
tea
i
do
it
miss
alice
it
not
good
for
you
to
go
so
long
without
eating
alice
now
rolled
up
her
sleeves
above
the
elbows
and
tying
a
large
white
apron
before
her
set
about
gathering
the
different
things
she
wanted
for
her
work
to
ellen
great
amusement
a
white
was
placed
upon
a
table
as
white
and
round
it
soon
grouped
the
pail
of
flour
the
plate
of
nice
yellow
butter
the
bowl
of
cream
the
sieve
tray
and
sundry
etceteras
and
then
first
sifting
some
flour
into
the
tray
alice
began
to
throw
in
the
other
things
one
after
another
and
toss
the
whole
about
with
a
carelessness
that
looked
as
if
all
would
go
wrong
but
with
a
confidence
that
seemed
to
say
all
was
going
right
ellen
gazed
in
comical
wonderment
did
you
think
cakes
were
made
without
hands
said
alice
laughing
at
her
look
you
saw
me
wash
mine
before
i
began
oh
i
not
thinking
of
that
said
ellen
i
am
not
afraid
of
your
hands
did
you
never
see
your
mother
do
this
said
alice
who
was
now
turning
and
rolling
about
the
dough
upon
the
board
in
a
way
that
seemed
to
ellen
curious
beyond
expression
no
never
she
said
mamma
never
kept
house
and
i
never
saw
anybody
do
it
then
your
aunt
does
not
let
you
into
the
mysteries
of
bread
and
butter
making
oh
said
ellen
with
a
sigh
i
have
enough
of
that
alice
now
applied
a
smooth
wooden
roller
to
the
cake
with
such
quickness
and
skill
that
the
lump
forthwith
lay
spread
upon
the
board
in
a
thin
even
layer
and
she
next
cut
it
into
little
round
cakes
with
the
edge
of
a
tumbler
half
the
board
was
covered
with
the
nice
little
white
things
which
ellen
declared
looked
good
enough
to
eat
already
and
she
had
quite
forgotten
all
possible
causes
of
vexation
past
present
or
future
when
suddenly
a
large
grey
cat
jumped
upon
the
table
and
coolly
walking
upon
the
planted
his
paw
directly
in
the
middle
of
one
of
his
mistress
cakes
take
him
off
oh
ellen
cried
alice
take
him
off
i
ca
touch
him
but
ellen
was
a
little
afraid
alice
then
gently
tried
to
shove
puss
off
with
her
elbow
but
he
seemed
to
think
that
was
very
good
fun
purred
whisked
his
great
tail
over
alice
bare
arm
and
rubbed
his
head
against
it
having
evidently
no
notion
that
he
was
not
just
where
he
ought
to
be
alice
and
ellen
were
too
much
amused
to
try
any
violent
method
of
relief
but
margery
happily
coming
in
seized
puss
in
both
hands
and
set
him
on
the
floor
just
look
at
the
print
of
his
paw
in
that
cake
said
ellen
he
has
set
his
mark
on
it
certainly
i
think
it
is
his
now
by
the
right
of
possession
if
not
the
right
of
discovery
i
think
he
discovered
the
cakes
too
said
ellen
laughing
why
yes
he
shall
have
that
one
baked
for
his
supper
does
he
like
cakes
indeed
he
does
he
is
very
particular
and
delicate
about
his
eating
is
captain
parry
captain
parry
said
ellen
is
that
his
name
yes
said
alice
laughing
i
do
wonder
you
look
astonished
ellen
i
have
had
that
cat
five
years
and
when
he
was
first
given
me
my
brother
jack
who
was
younger
then
than
he
is
now
and
had
been
reading
captain
parry
voyages
gave
him
that
name
and
would
have
him
called
so
oh
jack
said
alice
half
laughing
and
half
crying
ellen
wondered
why
but
she
went
to
wash
her
hands
and
when
her
face
was
again
turned
to
ellen
it
was
as
unruffled
as
ever
margery
my
cakes
are
ready
said
she
and
ellen
and
i
are
ready
too
very
well
miss
alice
the
kettle
is
just
going
to
boil
you
shall
have
tea
in
a
trice
i
do
some
eggs
for
you
something
anything
said
alice
i
feel
one
can
not
live
without
eating
come
ellen
you
and
i
will
go
and
set
the
ellen
was
very
happy
arranging
the
cups
and
saucers
and
other
things
that
alice
handed
her
from
the
cupboard
and
when
a
few
minutes
after
the
tea
and
the
cakes
came
in
and
she
and
alice
were
cosily
seated
poor
ellen
hardly
knew
herself
in
such
a
pleasant
state
of
things
chapter
xvii
the
very
sooth
of
it
is
that
an
has
the
force
of
an
ellen
dear
said
alice
as
she
poured
out
ellen
second
cup
of
tea
have
we
run
through
the
list
of
your
troubles
oh
no
miss
alice
indeed
we
have
but
we
have
got
through
the
worst
is
the
next
one
so
bad
it
would
spoil
our
supper
no
said
ellen
it
could
do
that
but
it
bad
enough
though
about
my
not
going
to
school
miss
alice
i
promised
myself
i
would
learn
so
much
while
mamma
was
away
and
surprise
her
when
she
came
back
and
instead
of
that
i
am
not
learning
anything
i
do
mean
not
learning
said
ellen
correcting
herself
but
i
ca
do
much
when
i
found
aunt
fortune
was
going
to
send
me
to
school
i
determined
i
would
try
to
study
by
myself
and
i
have
tried
but
i
get
along
well
now
do
lay
down
your
knife
and
fork
and
look
so
doleful
said
alice
smiling
this
is
a
matter
i
can
help
you
in
what
are
you
studying
some
things
i
can
manage
well
enough
said
ellen
the
easy
things
but
i
can
not
understand
my
arithmetic
without
some
one
to
explain
it
to
me
and
french
i
can
do
nothing
at
all
with
and
that
is
what
i
wanted
to
learn
most
of
all
and
often
i
want
to
ask
questions
about
my
history
suppose
said
alice
you
go
on
studying
by
yourself
as
much
and
as
well
as
you
can
and
bring
your
books
up
to
me
two
or
three
times
a
week
i
will
hear
and
explain
and
answer
questions
to
your
content
unless
you
should
be
too
hard
for
me
what
do
you
say
to
that
ellen
said
nothing
to
it
but
the
colour
that
rushed
to
her
cheeks
the
surprised
look
of
delight
were
answer
enough
it
will
do
then
said
alice
and
i
have
no
doubt
we
shall
untie
the
knot
of
those
arithmetical
problems
very
soon
but
ellen
my
dear
i
can
not
help
you
in
french
for
i
do
not
know
it
myself
what
will
you
do
about
that
i
do
know
i
am
sorry
so
am
i
for
your
sake
i
can
help
you
in
latin
if
that
would
be
any
comfort
to
you
it
would
be
much
comfort
to
me
said
ellen
laughing
mamma
wanted
me
to
learn
latin
but
i
wanted
to
learn
french
a
great
deal
more
i
do
care
about
latin
except
to
please
her
permit
me
to
ask
if
you
know
english
oh
yes
i
hope
so
i
knew
that
a
great
while
ago
did
you
i
am
very
happy
to
make
your
acquaintance
then
for
the
number
of
young
ladies
who
know
english
is
in
my
opinion
remarkably
small
are
you
sure
of
the
fact
ellen
why
yes
miss
alice
will
you
undertake
to
write
me
a
note
of
two
pages
that
shall
not
have
one
fault
of
grammar
nor
one
word
spelt
wrong
nor
anything
in
it
that
is
not
good
english
you
may
take
for
a
subject
the
history
of
this
afternoon
yes
if
you
wish
it
i
hope
i
can
write
a
note
that
long
without
making
mistakes
alice
smiled
i
will
not
stop
to
inquire
she
said
whether
is
latin
or
french
but
ellen
my
dear
it
is
not
english
ellen
blushed
a
little
though
she
laughed
too
i
believe
i
have
got
into
the
way
of
saying
that
by
hearing
aunt
fortune
and
van
brunt
say
it
i
do
think
i
ever
did
before
i
came
here
what
are
you
so
anxious
to
learn
french
for
mamma
knows
it
and
i
have
often
heard
her
talk
french
with
a
great
many
people
and
papa
and
i
always
wanted
to
be
able
to
talk
it
too
and
mamma
wanted
me
to
learn
it
she
said
there
were
a
great
many
french
books
i
ought
to
read
that
last
is
true
no
doubt
ellen
i
will
make
a
bargain
with
you
if
you
will
study
english
with
me
i
will
study
french
with
you
dear
miss
alice
said
ellen
caressing
her
i
do
it
without
that
i
study
anything
you
please
dear
ellen
i
believe
you
would
but
i
should
like
to
know
it
for
my
own
sake
we
study
it
together
we
shall
get
along
nicely
i
have
no
doubt
we
can
learn
to
read
it
at
least
and
that
is
the
main
point
but
how
shall
we
know
what
to
call
the
words
said
ellen
doubtfully
that
is
a
grave
question
said
alice
smiling
i
am
afraid
we
should
hit
upon
a
style
of
pronunciation
that
a
frenchman
would
make
nothing
of
i
have
it
she
exclaimed
clapping
her
hands
where
there
a
will
there
a
way
it
always
happens
so
ellen
i
have
an
old
friend
upon
the
mountain
who
will
give
us
exactly
what
we
want
unless
i
am
greatly
mistaken
we
go
and
see
her
that
is
the
very
thing
my
old
friend
mrs
vawse
mrs
vawse
repeated
ellen
not
the
grandmother
of
that
nancy
vawse
the
very
same
her
name
is
not
vawse
the
country
people
call
it
so
and
i
being
one
of
the
country
people
have
fallen
into
the
way
of
it
but
her
real
name
is
vosier
she
was
born
a
swiss
and
brought
up
in
a
wealthy
french
family
as
the
personal
attendant
of
a
young
lady
to
whom
she
became
exceedingly
attached
this
lady
finally
married
an
american
gentleman
and
so
great
was
vawse
love
to
her
that
she
left
country
and
family
to
follow
her
here
in
a
few
years
her
mistress
died
she
married
and
since
that
time
she
has
been
tossed
from
trouble
to
trouble
a
perfect
sea
of
troubles
till
now
she
is
left
like
a
wreck
upon
this
mountain
top
a
fine
wreck
she
is
i
go
to
see
her
very
often
and
next
time
i
will
call
for
you
and
we
will
propose
our
french
plan
nothing
will
please
her
better
i
know
by
the
way
ellen
are
you
as
well
versed
in
the
other
common
branches
of
education
as
you
are
in
your
mother
tongue
what
do
you
mean
miss
alice
geography
for
instance
do
you
know
it
well
yes
i
believe
so
i
am
sure
i
have
studied
it
till
i
am
sick
of
it
can
you
give
me
the
boundaries
of
great
thibet
or
peru
ellen
hesitated
i
had
rather
not
try
she
said
i
am
not
sure
i
ca
remember
those
queer
countries
in
asia
and
south
america
half
so
well
as
europe
and
north
america
do
you
know
anything
about
the
surface
of
the
country
in
italy
or
france
the
character
and
condition
of
the
people
what
kind
of
climate
they
have
and
what
grows
there
most
freely
why
no
said
ellen
nobody
ever
taught
me
that
would
you
like
to
go
over
the
atlas
again
talking
about
all
these
matters
as
well
as
the
mere
outlines
of
the
countries
you
have
studied
before
oh
yes
dearly
exclaimed
ellen
well
i
think
we
may
let
margery
have
the
but
here
is
captain
cake
oh
may
i
give
him
his
supper
said
ellen
certainly
you
must
carve
it
for
him
you
know
i
told
you
he
is
very
particular
give
him
some
of
the
egg
too
he
likes
that
now
where
is
the
captain
not
far
off
for
scarcely
had
alice
opened
the
door
and
called
him
once
or
twice
when
with
a
queer
little
note
of
answer
he
came
hurriedly
trotting
in
he
generally
has
his
supper
in
the
outer
kitchen
said
alice
but
i
grant
him
leave
to
have
it
here
as
a
particular
honour
to
him
and
you
how
handsome
he
is
and
how
large
said
ellen
yes
he
is
very
handsome
and
more
than
that
he
is
very
sensible
for
a
cat
do
you
see
how
prettily
his
paws
are
marked
jack
used
to
say
he
had
white
gloves
on
and
white
boots
too
said
ellen
no
only
one
leg
is
white
boots
are
mates
is
he
very
if
you
do
meddle
with
him
i
do
call
that
being
said
ellen
laughing
nor
i
but
truth
obliges
me
to
say
the
captain
does
not
permit
anybody
to
take
liberties
with
him
he
is
a
character
captain
parry
come
out
on
the
lawn
ellen
and
we
will
let
margery
clear
away
what
a
pleasant
face
margery
has
said
ellen
as
the
door
closed
behind
them
and
what
a
pleasant
way
she
has
of
speaking
i
like
to
hear
her
the
words
come
out
so
clear
and
i
do
know
how
but
not
like
other
people
you
have
a
quick
ear
ellen
you
are
very
right
margery
had
lived
too
long
in
england
before
she
came
here
to
lose
her
trick
of
speech
afterwards
but
thomas
speaks
as
thick
as
a
yankee
and
always
did
then
margery
is
english
said
ellen
to
be
sure
she
came
over
with
us
twelve
years
ago
for
the
pure
love
of
my
father
and
mother
and
i
believe
now
she
looks
upon
john
and
me
as
her
own
children
i
think
she
could
scarcely
love
us
more
if
we
were
so
in
truth
thomas
you
have
seen
thomas
yet
have
you
no
he
is
an
excellent
good
man
in
his
way
and
as
faithful
as
the
day
is
long
but
he
is
equal
to
his
wife
perhaps
i
am
partial
margery
came
to
america
for
the
love
of
us
and
thomas
came
for
the
love
of
margery
there
a
difference
but
miss
alice
what
miss
ellen
you
said
margery
came
over
yes
is
that
what
makes
you
look
so
astonished
but
then
you
are
english
too
well
what
of
that
you
wo
love
me
the
less
will
you
oh
no
said
ellen
my
own
mother
came
from
scotland
aunt
fortune
says
i
am
english
born
ellen
but
you
may
count
me
half
american
if
you
like
for
i
have
spent
rather
more
than
half
my
life
here
come
this
way
ellen
and
i
show
you
my
garden
it
is
some
distance
off
but
as
near
as
a
spot
could
be
found
fit
for
it
they
quitted
the
house
by
a
little
steep
path
leading
down
the
mountain
which
in
two
or
three
minutes
brought
them
to
a
clear
bit
of
ground
it
was
not
large
but
lying
very
prettily
among
the
trees
with
an
open
view
to
the
east
and
on
the
extreme
edge
and
at
the
lower
end
of
it
was
fixed
a
rude
bench
well
sheltered
by
the
towering
forest
trees
here
alice
and
ellen
sat
down
it
was
near
sunset
the
air
cool
and
sweet
the
evening
light
upon
field
and
sky
how
fair
it
is
said
alice
musingly
how
fair
and
lovely
look
at
those
long
shadows
of
the
mountains
ellen
and
how
bright
the
light
is
on
the
far
hills
it
wo
be
so
long
a
little
while
more
and
our
indian
summer
will
be
over
and
then
the
clouds
the
frost
and
the
wind
and
the
snow
well
let
them
come
i
wish
they
would
i
am
sure
said
ellen
i
am
sorry
enough
they
are
coming
why
all
seasons
have
their
pleasures
i
am
not
sorry
at
all
i
like
the
cold
very
much
i
guess
you
would
miss
alice
if
you
had
to
wash
every
morning
where
i
do
why
where
is
that
down
at
the
spout
at
the
what
is
that
pray
the
spout
of
water
just
down
a
little
way
from
the
kitchen
door
the
water
comes
in
a
little
long
very
long
trough
from
a
spring
at
the
back
of
the
and
at
the
end
of
the
trough
where
it
pours
out
is
the
spout
have
you
no
conveniences
for
washing
in
your
room
not
a
sign
of
such
a
thing
i
have
washed
at
the
spout
ever
since
i
have
been
here
said
ellen
laughing
in
spite
of
her
vexation
and
do
the
pigs
share
the
water
with
you
the
pigs
oh
no
the
trough
is
raised
up
from
the
ground
on
little
heaps
of
stones
they
ca
get
at
the
water
unless
they
drink
at
the
spring
and
i
do
think
they
do
that
so
many
big
stones
stand
around
it
well
ellen
i
must
say
that
it
is
rather
uncomfortable
even
without
any
danger
of
society
it
is
so
bad
just
now
said
ellen
in
this
warm
weather
but
in
that
cold
time
we
had
a
week
or
two
back
do
you
remember
miss
alice
just
before
the
indian
summer
began
oh
how
disagreeable
it
was
early
in
the
morning
you
know
the
sun
scarcely
up
and
the
cold
wind
blowing
my
hair
and
my
clothes
all
about
and
then
that
board
before
the
spout
that
i
have
to
stand
on
is
always
kept
wet
by
the
spattering
of
the
water
and
it
muddy
besides
and
very
slippery
there
a
kind
of
green
stuff
comes
upon
it
and
i
ca
stoop
down
for
fear
of
muddying
myself
i
have
to
tuck
my
clothes
round
me
and
bend
over
as
well
as
i
can
and
fetch
up
a
little
water
to
my
face
in
the
hollow
of
my
hand
and
of
course
i
have
to
do
that
a
great
many
times
before
i
get
enough
i
ca
help
laughing
said
ellen
but
it
is
a
laughing
matter
for
all
that
so
you
wash
your
face
in
your
hands
and
have
no
pitcher
but
a
long
wooden
trough
poor
child
i
am
sorry
for
you
i
think
you
must
have
some
other
way
of
managing
before
the
snow
comes
the
water
is
bitterly
cold
already
said
ellen
it
the
coldest
water
i
ever
saw
mamma
gave
me
a
nice
before
i
came
away
but
i
found
very
soon
this
was
a
queer
place
for
a
to
come
to
why
miss
alice
if
i
take
out
my
brush
or
comb
i
have
any
table
to
lay
them
on
but
one
that
too
high
and
my
poor
has
to
stay
on
the
floor
and
i
have
a
sign
of
a
bureau
all
my
things
are
tumbling
about
in
my
trunk
i
think
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
would
not
permit
at
any
rate
said
alice
if
my
things
were
confined
to
my
trunk
i
would
have
them
keep
good
order
there
at
least
well
so
they
do
said
ellen
pretty
good
order
i
did
mean
about
exactly
always
try
to
say
what
you
mean
but
now
ellen
love
do
you
know
i
must
send
you
away
do
you
see
the
sunlight
has
quitted
those
distant
hills
and
it
will
be
quite
gone
soon
you
must
hasten
home
ellen
made
no
answer
alice
had
taken
her
on
her
lap
again
and
she
was
nestling
there
with
her
friend
arms
wrapped
around
her
both
were
quite
still
for
a
minute
next
week
if
nothing
happens
we
will
begin
to
be
busy
with
our
books
you
shall
come
to
me
on
tuesday
and
friday
and
all
the
other
days
you
must
study
as
hard
as
you
can
at
home
for
i
am
very
particular
i
forewarn
you
but
suppose
aunt
fortune
should
not
let
me
come
said
ellen
without
stirring
oh
she
will
you
need
not
speak
about
it
i
come
down
and
ask
her
myself
and
nobody
ever
refuses
me
anything
i
should
think
they
would
said
ellen
then
do
you
set
the
first
example
said
alice
laughingly
i
ask
you
to
be
cheerful
and
happy
and
grow
wiser
and
better
every
day
dear
miss
alice
how
can
i
promise
that
dear
ellen
it
is
very
easy
there
is
one
who
has
promised
to
hear
and
answer
you
when
you
cry
to
him
he
will
make
you
in
his
own
likeness
again
and
to
know
and
love
him
and
not
be
happy
is
impossible
that
blessed
saviour
said
alice
oh
what
should
you
and
i
do
without
him
ellen
rivers
of
waters
in
a
dry
place
as
the
shadow
of
a
great
rock
in
a
weary
land
how
beautiful
how
true
how
often
i
think
of
that
ellen
was
silent
though
entering
into
the
feeling
of
the
words
remember
him
dear
ellen
remember
your
best
friend
learn
more
of
christ
our
dear
saviour
and
you
ca
help
but
be
happy
never
fancy
you
are
helpless
and
friendless
while
you
have
him
to
go
to
whenever
you
feel
wearied
and
sorry
flee
to
the
shadow
of
that
great
rock
will
you
and
do
you
understand
me
yes
yes
said
ellen
as
she
lifted
her
lips
to
kiss
her
friend
alice
heartily
returned
the
kiss
and
pressing
ellen
in
her
arms
said
now
ellen
dear
you
go
i
dare
not
keep
you
any
longer
it
will
be
too
late
now
i
fear
before
you
reach
home
quick
they
mounted
the
little
path
again
and
soon
were
at
the
house
and
ellen
was
putting
on
her
things
next
tuesday
remember
but
before
that
sunday
you
are
to
spend
sunday
with
me
come
bright
and
early
how
early
oh
as
early
as
you
please
before
breakfast
and
our
sunday
morning
breakfasts
are
late
ellen
we
have
to
set
off
betimes
to
go
to
church
kisses
and
and
then
ellen
was
running
down
the
road
at
a
great
rate
for
twilight
was
beginning
to
gather
and
she
had
a
good
way
to
go
she
ran
till
out
of
breath
then
walked
a
while
to
gather
breath
then
ran
again
running
down
hill
is
a
pretty
quick
way
of
travelling
so
before
very
long
she
saw
her
aunt
house
at
a
distance
she
walked
now
she
had
come
all
the
way
in
good
spirits
though
with
a
sense
upon
her
mind
of
something
disagreeable
to
come
when
she
saw
the
house
this
disagreeable
something
swallowed
up
all
her
thoughts
and
she
walked
leisurely
on
pondering
what
she
had
to
do
and
what
she
was
like
to
meet
in
the
doing
of
it
if
aunt
fortune
should
be
in
a
bad
humour
and
say
something
to
vex
me
but
i
not
be
vexed
but
it
will
be
very
hard
to
help
it
but
i
be
vexed
i
have
done
wrong
and
i
tell
her
so
and
ask
her
to
forgive
me
it
will
be
hard
but
i
do
it
i
say
what
i
ought
to
say
and
then
however
she
takes
it
i
shall
have
the
comfort
of
knowing
i
have
done
right
but
said
conscience
you
must
not
say
it
stiffly
and
proudly
you
must
say
it
humbly
and
as
if
you
really
felt
and
meant
it
i
will
said
ellen
she
paused
in
the
shed
and
looked
through
the
window
to
see
what
was
the
promise
of
things
within
not
good
her
aunt
step
sounded
heavy
and
ominous
ellen
guessed
she
was
not
in
a
pleasant
state
of
mind
she
opened
the
door
no
doubt
of
it
the
whole
air
of
miss
fortune
figure
to
the
very
handkerchief
that
was
tied
round
her
head
spoke
displeasure
she
is
in
a
good
mood
said
ellen
as
she
went
upstairs
to
leave
her
bonnet
and
cape
there
i
never
knew
her
to
be
when
she
had
that
handkerchief
on
she
returned
to
the
kitchen
immediately
her
aunt
was
busied
in
washing
and
wiping
the
dishes
i
have
come
home
rather
late
said
ellen
pleasantly
shall
i
help
you
aunt
fortune
her
aunt
cast
a
look
at
her
yes
you
may
help
me
go
and
put
on
a
pair
of
white
gloves
and
a
silk
apron
and
then
you
be
ready
ellen
looked
down
at
herself
oh
my
merino
i
forgot
about
that
go
and
change
it
miss
fortune
said
nothing
and
ellen
went
when
she
came
back
the
things
were
all
wiped
and
as
she
was
about
to
put
some
of
them
away
her
aunt
took
them
out
of
her
hands
bidding
her
go
and
sit
down
ellen
obeyed
and
was
mute
while
miss
fortune
dashed
round
with
a
display
of
energy
there
seemed
to
be
no
particular
call
for
and
speedily
had
everything
in
its
place
and
all
straight
and
square
about
the
kitchen
when
she
was
as
a
last
thing
brushing
the
crumbs
from
the
floor
into
the
fire
she
broke
the
silence
again
the
old
grandmother
sat
in
the
but
she
seldom
was
very
talkative
in
the
presence
of
her
stern
daughter
what
did
you
come
home
for
why
did
you
stay
at
mr
humphreys
miss
alice
did
ask
me
that
means
i
suppose
that
you
would
if
she
had
i
do
know
miss
alice
would
have
asked
me
to
do
anything
that
was
right
oh
no
of
course
not
miss
alice
is
a
piece
of
perfection
everybody
says
so
and
i
suppose
you
sing
the
same
song
who
have
seen
her
three
times
indeed
i
would
said
ellen
i
could
have
told
that
in
one
seeing
do
anything
in
the
world
for
miss
alice
ay
i
dare
say
that
the
way
of
it
you
can
show
not
one
bit
of
goodness
or
pleasantness
to
the
person
that
does
the
most
for
you
and
has
all
the
care
of
you
but
the
first
stranger
that
comes
along
you
can
be
all
honey
to
them
and
make
yourself
out
too
good
for
common
folks
and
go
and
tell
great
tales
how
you
are
used
at
home
i
suppose
i
am
sick
of
it
said
miss
fortune
setting
up
the
andirons
and
throwing
the
tongs
and
shovel
into
the
corner
in
a
way
that
made
the
iron
ring
again
one
might
as
good
be
a
stepmother
at
once
and
done
with
it
come
mother
it
time
for
you
to
go
to
bed
the
old
lady
rose
with
the
meekness
of
habitual
submission
and
went
upstairs
with
her
daughter
ellen
had
time
to
bethink
herself
while
they
were
gone
and
resolved
to
lose
no
time
when
her
aunt
came
back
in
doing
what
she
had
to
do
she
would
fain
have
persuaded
herself
to
put
it
off
it
is
late
she
said
to
herself
it
is
a
good
time
it
will
be
better
to
go
to
bed
now
and
ask
aunt
fortune
pardon
but
conscience
said
be
reconciled
to
thy
brother
miss
fortune
came
down
presently
but
before
ellen
could
get
any
words
out
her
aunt
prevented
her
come
light
your
candle
and
be
off
i
want
you
out
of
the
way
i
do
anything
with
people
about
ellen
rose
i
want
to
say
something
to
you
first
aunt
fortune
say
it
and
be
quick
i
have
time
to
stand
talking
aunt
fortune
said
ellen
stumbling
over
her
words
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
know
i
was
wrong
this
morning
and
i
am
sorry
and
i
hope
you
forgive
me
a
kind
of
indignant
laugh
escaped
from
miss
fortune
lips
it
easy
talking
i
rather
have
acting
i
rather
see
people
mend
their
ways
than
stand
and
make
speeches
about
them
being
sorry
help
the
matter
much
but
i
try
not
to
do
so
any
more
said
ellen
when
i
see
you
do
i
shall
begin
to
think
there
is
something
in
it
actions
speak
louder
than
words
i
do
believe
in
this
jumping
into
goodness
all
at
once
well
i
will
try
not
to
at
any
rate
said
ellen
sighing
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
see
it
what
has
brought
you
into
this
sudden
fit
of
dutifulness
and
fine
talking
miss
alice
told
me
i
ought
to
ask
your
pardon
for
what
i
had
done
wrong
said
ellen
scarce
able
to
keep
from
crying
and
i
know
i
did
wrong
this
morning
and
i
did
wrong
the
other
day
about
the
letter
and
i
am
sorry
whether
you
believe
it
or
no
miss
alice
told
you
did
she
so
all
this
is
to
please
miss
alice
i
suppose
you
were
afraid
your
friend
miss
alice
would
hear
of
some
of
your
goings
on
and
thought
you
had
better
make
up
with
me
is
that
it
ellen
answered
no
in
a
low
tone
but
had
no
voice
to
say
more
i
wish
miss
alice
would
look
after
her
own
affairs
and
let
other
people
houses
alone
that
always
the
way
with
your
pieces
of
perfection
they
eternally
finding
out
something
that
is
as
it
ought
to
be
among
their
neighbours
i
think
people
that
do
set
up
for
being
quite
such
great
things
get
along
quite
as
well
in
the
world
ellen
was
strongly
tempted
to
reply
but
kept
her
lips
shut
i
tell
you
what
said
miss
fortune
if
you
want
me
to
believe
that
all
this
talk
means
something
i
tell
you
what
you
shall
do
you
shall
just
tell
van
brunt
about
it
all
and
how
ugly
you
have
been
these
two
days
and
let
him
know
you
were
wrong
and
i
was
right
i
believe
he
thinks
you
can
not
do
anything
wrong
and
i
should
like
him
to
know
it
for
once
ellen
struggled
hard
with
herself
before
she
could
speak
miss
lips
began
to
wear
a
scornful
smile
i
tell
him
said
ellen
at
length
i
tell
him
i
was
wrong
if
you
wish
me
to
i
wish
it
i
like
people
eyes
to
be
opened
it
do
him
good
i
guess
and
you
too
now
have
you
anything
more
to
say
ellen
hesitated
the
colour
came
and
went
she
knew
it
was
a
good
time
but
how
could
she
wait
aunt
fortune
she
said
you
know
i
told
you
i
behaved
very
ill
about
that
letter
wo
you
forgive
me
forgive
you
yes
child
i
do
care
anything
about
it
then
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
let
me
have
my
letter
again
said
ellen
timidly
oh
i
ca
be
bothered
to
look
for
it
now
i
see
about
it
some
other
time
take
your
candle
and
go
to
bed
now
if
you
nothing
more
to
say
ellen
took
her
candle
and
went
some
tears
were
wrung
from
her
by
hurt
feeling
and
disappointment
but
she
had
the
smile
of
conscience
and
as
she
believed
of
him
whose
witness
conscience
is
she
remembered
that
great
rock
in
a
weary
land
and
she
went
to
sleep
in
the
shadow
of
it
the
next
day
was
saturday
ellen
was
up
early
and
after
carefully
performing
her
toilet
duties
she
had
a
nice
long
hour
before
it
was
time
to
go
downstairs
the
use
she
made
of
this
hour
had
fitted
her
to
do
cheerfully
and
well
her
morning
work
and
ellen
would
have
sat
down
to
breakfast
in
excellent
spirits
if
it
had
not
been
for
her
promised
disclosure
to
van
brunt
it
vexed
her
a
little
i
told
aunt
fortune
that
was
all
right
but
why
i
should
be
obliged
to
tell
van
brunt
i
do
know
but
if
it
convinces
aunt
fortune
that
i
am
in
earnest
and
meant
what
i
say
then
i
had
better
van
brunt
looked
uncommonly
grave
she
thought
her
aunt
uncommonly
satisfied
ellen
had
more
than
half
a
guess
at
the
reason
of
both
but
make
up
her
mind
to
speak
she
could
not
during
all
breakfast
time
she
ate
without
knowing
what
she
was
eating
van
brunt
at
length
having
finished
his
meal
without
saying
a
syllable
arose
and
was
about
to
go
forth
when
miss
fortune
stopped
him
wait
a
minute
van
brunt
she
said
ellen
has
something
to
say
to
you
go
ahead
ellen
ellen
rather
than
saw
the
smile
with
which
these
words
were
spoken
she
crimsoned
and
hesitated
ellen
and
i
had
some
trouble
yesterday
said
miss
fortune
and
she
wants
to
tell
you
about
it
van
brunt
stood
gravely
waiting
ellen
raised
her
eyes
which
were
full
to
his
face
van
brunt
she
said
aunt
fortune
wants
me
to
tell
you
what
i
told
her
last
night
that
i
knew
i
behaved
as
i
ought
not
to
her
yesterday
and
the
day
before
and
other
times
and
what
made
you
do
that
said
van
brunt
tell
him
said
miss
fortune
colouring
that
you
were
in
the
wrong
and
i
was
in
the
right
then
he
believe
it
i
suppose
i
was
wrong
said
ellen
and
i
was
right
said
miss
fortune
ellen
was
silent
van
brunt
looked
from
one
to
the
other
speak
said
miss
fortune
tell
him
the
whole
if
you
mean
what
you
say
i
ca
said
ellen
why
you
said
you
were
wrong
said
miss
fortune
that
only
half
of
the
business
if
you
were
wrong
i
was
right
why
do
you
say
so
and
not
make
such
a
piece
of
work
of
it
i
said
i
was
wrong
said
ellen
and
so
i
was
but
i
never
said
you
were
right
aunt
fortune
and
i
do
think
so
these
words
though
moderately
spoken
were
enough
to
put
miss
fortune
in
a
rage
what
did
i
do
that
was
wrong
she
said
come
i
should
like
to
know
what
was
it
ellen
out
with
it
say
everything
you
can
think
of
stop
and
hear
it
van
brunt
come
ellen
let
hear
the
whole
thank
you
i
heerd
quite
enough
said
that
gentleman
as
he
went
out
and
closed
the
door
and
i
have
said
too
much
said
ellen
pray
forgive
me
aunt
fortune
i
should
have
said
that
if
you
had
pressed
me
so
i
forgot
myself
a
moment
i
am
sorry
i
said
that
forgot
yourself
said
miss
fortune
i
wish
you
forget
yourself
out
of
my
house
please
to
forget
the
place
where
i
am
for
anyhow
i
got
enough
of
you
for
one
while
you
had
better
go
to
miss
alice
and
get
a
new
lesson
and
tell
her
you
are
coming
on
finely
gladly
would
ellen
indeed
have
gone
to
miss
alice
but
as
the
next
day
was
sunday
she
thought
it
best
to
wait
she
went
sorrowfully
to
her
own
room
why
could
i
be
quiet
said
ellen
if
i
had
only
held
my
tongue
that
unfortunate
minute
what
possessed
me
to
say
that
strong
passion
strong
pride
both
long
unbroken
and
ellen
had
yet
to
learn
that
many
a
prayer
and
many
a
tear
much
watchfulness
much
help
from
on
high
must
be
hers
before
she
could
be
thoroughly
dispossessed
of
these
evil
spirits
but
she
knew
her
sickness
she
had
applied
to
the
physician
she
was
in
a
fair
way
to
be
well
one
thought
in
her
solitary
room
that
day
drew
streams
of
tears
down
ellen
cheeks
my
letter
my
letter
what
shall
i
do
to
get
you
she
said
to
herself
it
serves
me
right
i
ought
to
have
got
in
a
passion
oh
i
have
got
a
lesson
this
time
chapter
xviii
tranquilitie
so
purely
sate
there
that
waves
great
nor
small
did
ever
rise
to
any
height
at
all
chapman
the
sunday
with
alice
met
all
ellen
hopes
she
wrote
a
very
long
letter
to
her
mother
giving
the
full
history
of
the
day
how
pleasantly
they
had
ridden
to
church
on
the
pretty
grey
pony
she
half
the
way
and
alice
the
other
half
talking
to
each
other
all
the
while
for
humphreys
had
ridden
on
before
how
lovely
the
road
was
winding
about
round
the
mountain
up
and
down
and
with
such
a
wide
fair
view
and
part
of
the
time
close
along
by
the
edge
of
the
water
this
had
been
ellen
first
ride
on
horseback
then
the
letter
described
the
little
church
humphreys
excellent
sermon
every
word
of
which
she
could
understand
alice
sunday
school
in
which
she
was
sole
teacher
and
how
ellen
had
four
little
ones
put
under
care
and
told
how
while
humphreys
went
on
to
hold
a
second
service
at
a
village
some
six
miles
off
his
daughter
ministered
to
two
infirm
old
women
at
reading
and
explaining
the
bible
to
the
one
and
to
the
other
who
was
blind
repeating
the
whole
substance
of
her
father
sermon
miss
alice
told
me
that
nobody
could
enjoy
a
sermon
better
than
that
old
woman
but
she
can
not
go
out
and
every
sunday
miss
alice
goes
and
preaches
to
her
she
says
how
ellen
went
home
in
the
boat
with
thomas
and
margery
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
and
night
also
at
the
parsonage
and
how
polite
and
kind
humphreys
had
been
he
a
very
man
indeed
said
the
letter
and
not
a
bit
like
miss
alice
he
is
a
great
deal
older
than
i
expected
this
letter
was
much
the
longest
ellen
had
ever
written
in
her
life
but
she
had
set
her
heart
on
having
her
mother
sympathy
in
her
new
pleasures
though
not
to
be
had
but
after
the
lapse
of
many
weeks
and
beyond
a
sad
interval
of
land
and
sea
still
she
must
have
it
and
her
little
fingers
travelled
busily
over
the
paper
hour
after
hour
as
she
found
time
till
the
long
epistle
was
finished
she
was
hard
at
work
at
it
on
tuesday
afternoon
when
her
aunt
called
her
down
and
obeying
the
call
to
her
great
surprise
and
delight
she
found
alice
seated
in
the
chimney
corner
and
chatting
away
with
her
old
grandmother
who
looked
remarkably
pleased
miss
fortune
was
bustling
round
as
usual
looking
at
nobody
though
putting
in
her
word
now
and
then
come
ellen
said
alice
get
your
bonnet
i
am
going
up
the
mountain
to
see
vawse
and
your
aunt
has
given
leave
for
you
to
go
with
me
wrap
yourself
up
well
for
it
is
not
warm
without
waiting
for
a
word
of
answer
ellen
joyfully
ran
off
you
have
chosen
rather
an
ugly
day
for
your
walk
miss
alice
ca
expect
pretty
days
in
december
miss
fortune
i
am
only
too
happy
it
does
storm
it
will
by
i
think
but
i
have
learned
not
to
mind
weathers
yes
i
know
you
have
said
miss
fortune
you
stop
up
on
the
mountain
till
i
guess
wo
you
oh
yes
i
shall
want
something
to
fortify
me
before
coming
home
after
such
a
long
tramp
you
see
i
have
brought
a
basket
along
i
thought
it
safest
to
take
a
loaf
of
bread
with
me
for
no
one
can
tell
what
may
be
in
vawse
cupboard
and
to
lose
our
supper
is
not
a
thing
to
be
thought
of
well
have
you
looked
out
for
butter
too
for
you
find
none
where
you
going
i
do
know
how
the
old
lady
lives
up
there
but
without
butter
i
reckon
i
have
taken
care
of
that
too
thank
you
miss
fortune
you
see
i
a
creature
ellen
said
her
aunt
as
ellen
now
cloaked
and
hooded
came
in
go
into
the
buttery
and
fetch
out
one
of
them
pumpkin
pies
to
put
in
miss
alice
basket
thank
you
miss
fortune
said
alice
smiling
i
shall
tell
vawse
who
it
comes
from
now
my
dear
let
be
off
we
have
a
long
walk
before
us
ellen
was
quite
ready
to
be
off
but
no
sooner
had
she
opened
the
outer
shed
door
than
her
voice
was
heard
in
astonishment
a
cat
what
cat
is
this
miss
alice
look
here
here
the
captain
i
do
believe
here
is
the
captain
indeed
said
alice
oh
pussy
pussy
what
have
you
come
for
pussy
walked
up
to
his
mistress
and
stroking
himself
and
his
great
tail
against
her
dress
seemed
to
say
that
he
had
come
for
her
sake
and
that
it
made
no
difference
to
him
where
she
was
going
he
was
sitting
as
gravely
as
possible
said
ellen
on
the
stone
just
outside
the
door
waiting
for
the
door
to
be
opened
how
could
he
have
come
there
why
he
has
followed
me
said
alice
he
often
does
but
i
came
quick
and
i
thought
i
had
left
him
at
home
this
is
too
long
an
expedition
for
him
kitty
i
wish
you
had
stayed
at
home
kitty
did
not
think
so
he
was
arching
his
neck
and
purring
in
acknowledgment
of
alice
soft
touch
ca
you
send
him
back
said
ellen
no
my
dear
he
is
the
most
sensible
of
cats
no
doubt
but
he
could
by
no
means
understand
such
an
order
no
we
must
let
him
trot
on
after
us
and
when
he
gets
tired
i
will
carry
him
it
wo
be
the
first
time
by
a
good
many
they
set
off
with
a
quick
pace
which
the
weather
forbade
them
to
slacken
it
was
somewhat
as
miss
fortune
had
said
an
ugly
afternoon
the
clouds
hung
cold
and
grey
and
the
air
had
a
raw
chill
feeling
that
betokened
a
coming
snow
the
wind
blew
strong
too
and
seemed
to
carry
the
chillness
through
all
manner
of
wrappers
alice
and
ellen
however
did
not
much
care
for
it
they
walked
and
ran
by
turns
only
stopping
once
in
a
while
when
poor
captain
uneasy
cry
warned
them
they
had
left
him
too
far
behind
still
he
would
not
submit
to
be
carried
but
jumped
down
whenever
alice
attempted
it
and
trotted
on
most
perseveringly
as
they
neared
the
foot
of
the
mountain
they
were
somewhat
sheltered
from
the
wind
and
could
afford
to
walk
more
slowly
how
is
it
between
you
and
your
aunt
fortune
now
said
alice
oh
we
do
get
on
well
at
all
miss
alice
and
i
do
know
exactly
what
to
do
you
know
i
said
i
would
ask
her
pardon
well
i
did
that
same
night
after
i
got
home
but
it
was
very
disagreeable
she
seem
to
believe
i
was
in
earnest
and
wanted
me
to
tell
van
brunt
that
i
had
been
wrong
i
thought
that
was
rather
hard
but
at
any
rate
i
said
i
would
and
next
morning
i
did
tell
him
so
and
i
believe
all
would
have
done
well
if
i
could
only
have
been
quiet
but
aunt
fortune
said
something
that
vexed
me
and
almost
before
i
knew
it
i
said
something
that
vexed
her
dreadfully
it
was
nothing
very
bad
miss
alice
though
i
ought
not
to
have
said
it
and
i
was
sorry
two
minutes
after
but
i
just
got
provoked
and
what
shall
i
do
for
it
so
hard
to
prevent
it
the
only
thing
i
know
said
alice
with
a
slight
smile
is
to
be
full
of
that
charity
which
among
other
lovely
ways
of
showing
itself
has
this
that
it
is
easily
provoked
i
am
easily
provoked
said
ellen
then
you
know
one
thing
at
any
rate
that
is
to
be
watched
and
prayed
and
guarded
against
it
is
no
little
matter
to
be
acquainted
with
own
weak
points
i
tried
so
hard
to
keep
quiet
that
morning
said
ellen
and
if
i
only
could
have
let
that
unlucky
speech
alone
but
somehow
i
forgot
myself
and
i
just
told
her
what
i
thought
which
it
is
very
often
best
not
to
do
i
do
believe
said
ellen
aunt
fortune
would
like
to
have
van
brunt
not
like
me
well
said
alice
what
then
nothing
i
suppose
i
hope
you
are
not
going
to
lay
it
up
against
her
no
i
hope
not
take
care
dear
ellen
do
take
up
the
trade
of
suspecting
evil
you
could
not
take
up
a
worse
and
even
when
it
is
forced
upon
you
see
as
little
of
it
as
you
can
and
forget
as
soon
as
you
can
what
you
see
your
aunt
it
may
be
is
not
a
very
happy
person
and
no
one
can
tell
but
those
that
are
unhappy
how
hard
it
is
not
to
be
unamiable
too
return
good
for
evil
as
fast
as
you
can
and
you
will
soon
either
have
nothing
to
complain
of
or
be
very
well
able
to
bear
it
they
now
began
to
go
up
the
mountain
and
the
path
became
in
places
steep
and
rugged
enough
there
is
an
easier
way
on
the
other
side
said
alice
but
this
is
the
nearest
for
us
captain
parry
now
showed
signs
of
being
decidedly
weary
and
permitted
alice
to
take
him
up
but
he
presently
mounted
from
her
arms
to
her
shoulder
and
to
ellen
great
amusement
kept
his
place
there
passing
from
one
shoulder
to
the
other
and
every
now
and
then
sticking
his
nose
up
into
her
bonnet
as
if
to
kiss
her
what
he
do
that
for
said
ellen
because
he
loves
me
and
is
pleased
said
alice
put
your
ear
close
ellen
and
hear
the
quiet
way
he
is
purring
to
himself
do
you
hear
that
his
way
he
very
seldom
purrs
aloud
he
a
very
funny
cat
said
ellen
laughing
cat
said
alice
there
is
such
a
cat
as
this
to
be
seen
he
a
cat
to
be
respected
my
old
captain
parry
he
is
not
to
be
laughed
at
ellen
i
can
tell
you
the
travellers
went
on
with
goodwill
but
the
path
was
so
steep
and
the
way
so
long
that
when
about
half
way
up
the
mountain
they
were
fain
to
follow
the
example
of
their
companion
and
rest
themselves
they
sat
down
on
the
ground
they
had
warmed
themselves
with
walking
but
the
weather
was
as
chill
and
disagreeable
and
gusty
as
ever
every
now
and
then
the
wind
came
sweeping
by
catching
up
the
dried
leaves
at
their
feet
and
whirling
and
scattering
them
off
to
a
distance
warning
voice
i
never
was
in
the
country
before
when
the
leaves
were
off
the
trees
said
ellen
it
is
so
pretty
miss
alice
do
you
think
so
so
pretty
no
i
suppose
not
if
we
were
to
have
it
all
the
while
but
i
like
the
change
very
much
do
you
like
to
see
the
leaves
off
the
trees
yes
in
the
time
of
it
there
beauty
in
the
leafless
trees
that
you
can
not
see
in
summer
just
look
ellen
no
i
can
not
find
you
a
nice
specimen
here
they
grow
too
thick
but
where
they
have
room
the
way
the
branches
spread
and
ramify
or
branch
out
again
is
most
beautiful
there
first
the
trunk
then
the
large
branches
then
those
divide
into
smaller
ones
and
those
part
and
part
again
into
smaller
and
smaller
twigs
till
you
are
canopied
as
it
were
with
a
network
of
fine
stems
and
when
the
snow
falls
gently
on
them
oh
ellen
winter
has
its
own
beauties
i
love
it
all
the
cold
and
the
wind
and
the
snow
and
the
bare
forests
and
our
little
river
of
ice
what
pleasant
to
church
i
have
had
upon
that
river
and
then
the
evergreens
look
at
them
you
do
know
in
summer
how
much
they
are
worth
wait
till
you
see
the
hemlock
branches
bending
with
a
weight
of
snow
and
then
if
you
do
say
the
winter
is
beautiful
i
give
you
up
as
a
young
lady
of
bad
taste
i
dare
say
i
shall
said
ellen
i
am
sure
i
shall
like
what
you
like
but
miss
alice
what
makes
the
leaves
fall
when
the
cold
weather
comes
a
very
pretty
question
ellen
and
one
that
ca
be
answered
in
a
breath
i
asked
aunt
fortune
the
other
day
said
ellen
laughing
very
heartily
and
she
told
me
to
hush
up
and
not
be
a
fool
and
i
told
her
i
really
wanted
to
know
and
she
said
she
would
make
herself
a
simpleton
if
she
was
in
my
place
so
i
thought
i
might
as
well
be
quiet
by
the
time
the
cold
weather
comes
ellen
the
leaves
have
done
their
work
and
are
no
more
needed
do
you
know
what
work
they
have
to
do
do
you
know
what
is
the
use
of
leaves
why
for
prettiness
i
suppose
said
ellen
and
to
give
shade
i
do
know
anything
else
shade
is
one
of
their
uses
no
doubt
and
prettiness
too
he
who
made
the
trees
made
them
to
the
eyes
as
well
as
for
food
so
we
have
an
infinite
variety
of
leaves
one
shape
would
have
done
the
work
just
as
well
for
every
kind
of
tree
but
then
we
should
have
lost
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
but
ellen
the
tree
could
not
live
without
leaves
in
the
spring
the
thin
sap
which
the
roots
suck
up
from
the
ground
is
drawn
into
the
leaves
there
by
the
help
of
the
sun
and
air
it
is
thickened
and
prepared
in
a
way
you
can
not
understand
and
goes
back
to
supply
the
wood
with
the
various
matters
necessary
for
its
growth
and
hardness
after
this
has
gone
on
some
time
the
little
vessels
of
the
leaves
become
clogged
and
stopped
up
with
earthy
and
other
matter
they
cease
to
do
their
work
any
longer
the
hot
sun
dries
them
up
more
and
more
and
by
the
time
the
frost
comes
they
are
as
good
as
dead
that
finishes
them
and
they
drop
off
from
the
branch
that
needs
them
no
more
do
you
understand
all
this
yes
very
well
said
ellen
and
it
exactly
what
i
wanted
to
know
and
very
curious
so
the
trees
could
live
without
leaves
no
more
than
you
could
without
a
heart
and
lungs
i
am
very
glad
to
know
that
said
ellen
then
how
is
it
with
the
evergreens
miss
alice
why
do
their
leaves
die
and
drop
off
too
they
do
look
how
the
ground
is
carpeted
under
that
pine
tree
but
they
stay
green
all
winter
do
they
yes
their
leaves
are
fitted
to
resist
frost
i
do
know
what
the
people
in
cold
countries
would
do
else
they
have
the
fate
of
all
other
leaves
however
they
live
awhile
do
their
work
and
then
die
not
all
at
once
though
there
is
always
a
supply
left
on
the
tree
are
we
rested
enough
to
begin
again
i
am
said
ellen
i
do
know
about
the
captain
poor
fellow
fast
asleep
i
declare
it
too
bad
to
wake
you
up
pussy
have
we
had
a
pleasant
little
rest
miss
alice
i
have
learnt
something
while
we
have
been
sitting
here
is
pleasant
ellen
said
alice
as
they
began
their
upward
march
i
would
i
might
be
all
the
while
learning
something
but
you
have
been
teaching
miss
alice
and
that
as
good
mamma
used
to
say
it
is
more
blessed
to
give
than
to
receive
thank
you
ellen
said
alice
smiling
that
ought
to
satisfy
me
certainly
they
bent
themselves
against
the
steep
hill
again
and
pressed
on
as
they
rose
higher
they
felt
it
grow
more
cold
and
bleak
the
woods
gave
them
less
shelter
and
the
wind
swept
round
the
mountain
head
and
over
them
with
great
force
making
their
way
quite
difficult
courage
ellen
said
alice
as
they
struggled
on
we
soon
be
there
i
wonder
said
the
panting
ellen
as
making
an
effort
she
came
up
alongside
of
alice
i
wonder
why
vawse
will
live
in
such
a
disagreeable
place
it
is
not
disagreeable
to
her
ellen
though
i
must
say
i
should
not
like
to
have
too
much
of
this
wind
but
does
she
really
like
to
live
up
here
better
than
down
below
where
it
is
warmer
and
all
alone
too
yes
she
does
ask
her
why
ellen
and
see
what
she
will
tell
you
she
likes
it
so
much
better
that
this
little
cottage
was
built
on
purpose
for
her
ten
years
ago
by
a
good
old
friend
of
hers
a
connection
of
the
lady
whom
she
followed
to
this
country
well
said
ellen
she
must
have
a
queer
taste
that
is
all
i
can
say
they
were
now
within
a
few
easy
steps
of
the
house
which
did
not
look
so
uncomfortable
when
they
came
close
to
it
it
was
small
and
low
of
only
one
storey
though
it
is
true
the
roof
ran
up
very
steep
to
a
high
and
sharp
gable
it
was
perched
so
snugly
in
a
niche
of
the
hill
that
the
little
yard
was
completely
sheltered
with
a
high
wall
of
rock
the
house
itself
stood
out
more
boldly
and
caught
pretty
well
near
all
the
winds
that
blew
but
so
alice
informed
ellen
the
inmate
likes
to
have
it
and
that
roof
said
alice
she
begged
marshman
when
the
cottage
was
building
that
the
roof
might
be
high
and
pointed
she
said
her
eyes
were
tired
with
the
low
roofs
of
this
country
and
if
he
would
have
it
made
so
it
would
be
a
great
relief
to
them
the
odd
roof
ellen
thought
was
pretty
but
they
now
reached
the
door
protected
with
a
deep
porch
alice
entered
and
knocked
at
the
other
door
they
were
bade
to
come
in
a
woman
was
there
stepping
briskly
back
and
forth
before
a
large
she
half
turned
her
head
to
see
who
the
comers
were
then
stopped
her
wheel
instantly
and
came
to
meet
them
with
open
arms
miss
alice
dear
miss
alice
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
and
i
you
dear
vawse
said
alice
kissing
her
here
another
friend
you
must
welcome
for
my
sake
little
ellen
montgomery
i
am
very
glad
to
see
miss
ellen
said
the
old
woman
kissing
her
also
and
ellen
did
not
shrink
from
the
kiss
so
pleasant
were
the
lips
that
tendered
it
so
kind
and
frank
the
smile
so
winning
the
eye
so
agreeable
the
whole
air
of
the
person
she
turned
from
ellen
again
to
miss
alice
it
a
long
while
that
i
have
not
seen
you
dear
not
since
you
went
to
marshman
and
what
a
day
you
have
chosen
to
come
at
last
i
ca
help
that
said
alice
pulling
off
her
bonnet
i
wait
any
longer
i
wanted
to
see
you
dolefully
mrs
vawse
why
my
dear
what
the
matter
i
have
wanted
to
see
but
not
dolefully
that
the
very
thing
vawse
i
wanted
to
see
you
to
get
a
lesson
of
quiet
contentment
i
never
thought
you
wanted
such
a
lesson
miss
alice
what
the
matter
i
ca
get
over
john
going
away
her
lip
trembled
and
her
eye
was
swimming
as
she
said
so
the
old
woman
passed
her
hands
over
the
gentle
head
and
kissed
her
brow
so
i
thought
so
i
felt
when
my
mistress
died
and
my
husband
and
my
sons
one
after
the
other
but
now
i
think
i
can
say
with
paul
have
learned
in
whatsoever
state
i
am
therewith
to
be
content
i
think
so
maybe
that
i
deceive
myself
but
they
are
all
gone
and
i
am
certain
that
i
am
content
now
then
surely
i
ought
to
be
said
alice
it
is
not
till
one
looses
one
hold
of
other
things
and
looks
to
jesus
alone
that
one
finds
how
much
he
can
do
is
a
friend
that
sticketh
closer
than
a
brother
but
i
never
knew
all
that
meant
till
i
had
no
other
friends
to
lean
upon
nay
i
should
not
say
other
friends
but
my
dearest
were
taken
away
you
have
dearest
still
miss
alice
two
of
them
said
alice
faintly
and
hardly
that
now
i
have
not
one
said
the
old
woman
i
have
not
one
but
my
home
is
in
heaven
and
my
saviour
is
there
preparing
a
place
for
me
i
know
it
i
am
sure
of
it
and
i
can
wait
a
little
while
and
rejoice
all
the
while
i
am
waiting
dearest
miss
alice
of
them
that
trust
in
him
shall
be
desolate
do
you
believe
that
i
do
surely
vawse
said
alice
wiping
away
a
tear
or
two
but
i
forget
it
sometimes
or
the
pressure
of
present
pain
is
too
much
for
all
that
faith
and
hope
can
do
it
hinders
faith
and
hope
from
acting
that
is
the
trouble
that
seek
the
lord
shall
not
want
any
good
thing
i
know
that
is
true
of
my
own
experience
so
will
you
dear
i
know
it
vawse
i
know
it
all
but
it
does
me
good
to
hear
you
say
it
i
thought
i
should
become
accustomed
to
john
absence
but
i
do
not
at
all
the
autumn
winds
all
the
while
seem
to
sing
to
me
that
he
is
away
my
dear
love
said
the
old
lady
it
sorrows
me
much
to
hear
you
speak
so
i
would
take
away
this
trial
from
you
if
i
could
but
he
knows
best
seek
to
live
nearer
to
the
lord
dear
miss
alice
and
he
will
give
you
much
more
than
he
has
taken
away
alice
again
brushed
away
some
tears
i
felt
i
must
come
and
see
you
said
she
and
you
have
comforted
me
already
the
sound
of
your
voice
always
does
me
good
i
catch
courage
and
patience
from
you
i
believe
iron
sharpeneth
iron
so
a
man
sharpeneth
the
countenance
of
his
friend
how
did
you
leave
and
marshman
and
has
george
returned
yet
drawing
their
chairs
together
a
close
conversation
began
ellen
had
been
painfully
interested
and
surprised
by
what
went
before
but
the
low
tone
of
voice
now
seemed
to
be
not
meant
for
her
ear
and
turning
away
her
attention
she
amused
herself
with
taking
a
general
survey
it
was
easy
to
see
that
vawse
lived
in
this
room
and
probably
had
no
other
to
live
in
her
bed
was
in
one
corner
cupboards
filled
the
deep
recesses
on
each
side
of
the
chimney
and
in
the
wide
fireplace
the
crane
and
the
hooks
and
trammels
hanging
upon
it
showed
that
the
bedroom
and
was
the
kitchen
too
most
of
the
floor
was
covered
with
a
thick
rag
carpet
where
the
boards
could
be
seen
they
were
beautifully
clean
and
white
and
everything
else
in
the
room
in
this
respect
matched
with
the
boards
the
panes
of
glass
in
the
little
windows
were
clean
and
bright
as
panes
of
glass
could
be
made
the
hearth
was
clean
swept
up
the
cupboard
doors
were
unstained
and
unsoiled
though
fingers
had
worn
the
paint
off
dust
was
nowhere
on
a
little
stand
by
the
chimney
corner
lay
a
large
bible
and
another
book
close
beside
stood
a
cushioned
some
other
apartment
there
probably
was
where
wood
and
stores
were
kept
nothing
was
to
be
seen
here
that
did
not
agree
with
a
very
comfortable
face
of
the
whole
it
looked
as
if
one
might
be
happy
there
it
looked
as
if
somebody
happy
there
and
a
glance
at
the
old
lady
of
the
house
would
not
alter
the
opinion
many
a
glance
ellen
gave
her
as
she
sat
talking
with
alice
and
with
every
one
she
felt
more
and
more
drawn
towards
her
she
was
somewhat
under
the
common
size
and
rather
stout
her
countenance
most
agreeable
there
was
sense
character
sweetness
in
it
some
wrinkles
no
doubt
were
there
too
lines
that
spoke
of
sorrows
once
known
those
storms
had
all
passed
away
the
last
shadow
of
a
cloud
had
departed
her
evening
sun
was
shining
clear
and
bright
towards
the
setting
and
her
brow
was
beautifully
placid
not
as
though
it
never
had
been
but
as
if
it
never
could
be
ruffled
again
respect
no
one
could
help
feeling
for
her
and
more
than
respect
one
felt
would
grow
with
acquaintance
her
dress
was
very
odd
ellen
thought
it
was
not
american
and
what
it
was
she
did
not
know
but
supposed
vawse
must
have
a
lingering
fancy
for
the
costume
as
well
as
for
the
roofs
of
her
fatherland
more
than
all
her
eye
turned
again
and
again
to
the
face
which
seemed
to
her
in
its
changing
expression
winning
and
pleasant
exceedingly
the
mouth
had
not
forgotten
to
smile
nor
the
eye
to
laugh
and
though
this
was
not
often
seen
the
constant
play
of
feature
showed
a
deep
and
lively
sympathy
in
all
alice
was
saying
and
held
charmed
gaze
and
when
the
old
lady
looks
and
words
were
at
length
turned
to
herself
she
blushed
to
think
how
long
she
had
been
looking
steadily
at
a
stranger
little
miss
ellen
how
do
you
like
my
house
on
the
rock
here
i
do
know
said
ellen
i
like
it
very
much
only
i
think
i
should
like
it
so
well
in
winter
i
am
not
certain
that
i
do
like
it
then
best
of
all
why
would
you
not
like
it
in
winter
i
should
like
the
cold
and
to
be
alone
i
like
to
be
alone
but
cold
i
am
in
no
danger
of
freezing
miss
ellen
i
make
myself
very
warm
keep
good
fires
and
my
house
is
too
strong
for
the
wind
to
blow
it
away
do
you
want
to
go
out
and
see
my
cow
i
have
one
of
the
best
cows
that
ever
you
saw
her
name
is
snow
there
is
not
a
black
hair
upon
her
she
is
all
white
come
miss
alice
marshman
sent
her
to
me
a
month
ago
she
a
great
treasure
and
worth
looking
at
they
went
across
the
yard
to
the
tiny
barn
or
outhouse
where
they
found
snow
nicely
cared
for
she
was
in
a
warm
stable
a
nice
bedding
of
straw
upon
the
floor
and
plenty
of
hay
laid
up
for
her
snow
deserved
it
for
she
was
a
beauty
and
a
very
cow
letting
alice
and
ellen
stroke
her
and
pat
her
and
feel
of
her
thick
hide
with
the
most
perfect
placidity
vawse
meanwhile
went
to
the
door
to
look
out
nancy
ought
to
be
home
to
milk
her
she
said
i
must
give
you
supper
and
send
you
off
i
no
feeling
nor
smell
if
snow
is
thick
in
the
air
somewhere
we
shall
see
it
here
soon
i
milk
her
said
alice
i
milk
her
said
ellen
i
milk
her
ah
do
let
me
i
know
how
to
milk
van
brunt
taught
me
and
i
have
done
it
several
times
may
i
i
should
like
it
dearly
you
shall
do
it
surely
my
child
said
vawse
come
with
me
and
i
give
you
the
pail
and
the
when
alice
and
ellen
came
in
with
the
milk
they
found
the
kettle
on
the
little
table
set
and
vawse
very
busy
at
another
table
what
are
you
doing
vawse
may
i
ask
said
alice
i
just
stirring
up
some
indian
meal
for
you
i
find
i
have
not
but
a
crust
left
please
to
put
that
away
for
another
time
do
you
think
i
know
better
than
to
come
up
to
this
without
bringing
along
something
to
live
upon
while
i
am
here
here
a
basket
and
in
it
are
divers
things
i
believe
margery
and
i
between
us
have
packed
up
enough
for
two
or
three
suppers
to
say
nothing
of
miss
fortune
pie
there
it
is
sure
to
be
good
you
know
and
here
are
some
of
my
cakes
that
you
like
so
much
vawse
said
alice
as
she
went
on
pulling
the
things
out
of
the
basket
there
is
a
bowl
of
butter
that
not
wanted
i
see
and
here
is
a
loaf
of
bread
and
that
all
ellen
my
dear
this
basket
will
be
lighter
to
carry
down
than
it
was
to
bring
up
i
am
glad
of
it
i
am
sure
said
ellen
my
arm
has
done
aching
yet
though
i
had
it
so
little
while
ah
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
kettle
singing
said
their
hostess
i
can
give
you
good
tea
miss
alice
you
think
so
i
know
for
it
the
same
john
sent
me
it
is
very
fine
tea
and
he
sent
me
a
noble
supply
like
himself
continued
vawse
taking
some
out
of
her
little
caddy
i
ought
not
to
say
i
have
no
friends
left
i
can
not
eat
a
meal
that
i
am
not
reminded
of
two
good
ones
john
knew
one
of
my
weak
points
when
he
sent
me
that
box
of
souchong
the
supper
was
ready
and
the
little
party
gathered
round
the
table
the
tea
did
credit
to
the
judgment
of
the
giver
and
the
skill
of
the
maker
but
they
were
no
critics
that
drank
it
alice
and
ellen
were
much
too
hungry
and
too
happy
to
be
particular
miss
fortune
pumpkin
pie
was
declared
to
be
very
fine
and
so
were
vawse
cheese
and
butter
eating
and
talking
went
on
with
great
spirit
their
old
friend
seeming
scarce
less
pleased
or
less
lively
than
themselves
alice
proposed
the
french
plan
and
vawse
entered
into
it
very
frankly
it
was
easy
to
see
that
the
style
of
building
and
of
dress
to
which
she
had
been
accustomed
in
early
life
were
not
the
only
things
remembered
kindly
for
old
time
sake
it
was
settled
they
should
meet
as
frequently
as
might
be
either
here
or
at
the
parsonage
and
become
good
frenchwomen
with
all
convenient
speed
will
you
wish
to
walk
so
far
to
see
me
again
little
miss
ellen
oh
yes
you
wo
fear
the
deep
snow
and
the
wind
and
cold
and
the
steep
hill
oh
no
i
wo
mind
them
a
bit
but
miss
alice
told
me
to
ask
you
why
you
loved
better
to
live
up
here
than
down
where
it
is
warmer
i
should
ask
if
she
had
said
i
might
ellen
has
a
great
fancy
for
getting
at
the
reason
of
everything
vawse
said
alice
smiling
you
wonder
anybody
should
choose
it
do
you
miss
ellen
said
the
old
lady
yes
a
little
i
tell
you
the
reason
my
child
it
is
for
the
love
of
my
old
home
and
the
memory
of
my
young
days
till
i
was
as
old
as
you
are
and
a
little
older
i
lived
among
the
mountains
and
upon
them
and
after
that
for
many
a
year
they
were
just
before
my
eyes
every
day
stretching
away
for
more
than
hundred
miles
and
piled
up
one
above
another
fifty
times
as
big
as
any
you
ever
saw
these
are
only
molehills
to
them
i
loved
them
oh
how
i
love
them
still
if
i
have
one
unsatisfied
wish
said
the
old
lady
turning
to
alice
it
is
to
see
my
alps
again
but
that
will
never
be
now
miss
ellen
it
is
not
that
i
fancy
when
i
get
to
the
top
of
this
hill
that
i
am
among
my
own
mountains
but
i
can
breathe
better
here
than
down
in
the
plain
i
feel
more
free
and
in
the
village
i
would
not
live
for
gold
unless
that
duty
bade
me
but
all
alone
so
far
from
everybody
said
ellen
i
am
never
lonely
and
old
as
i
am
i
do
mind
a
long
walk
or
a
rough
road
any
more
than
your
young
feet
do
but
is
it
very
cold
said
ellen
yes
it
is
very
cold
what
of
that
i
make
a
good
blazing
fire
and
then
i
like
to
hear
the
wind
whistle
yes
but
you
would
like
to
have
it
whistling
inside
as
well
as
out
said
alice
i
will
come
and
do
the
listing
and
caulking
for
you
in
a
day
or
two
oh
you
have
it
done
without
me
i
am
sorry
no
need
to
be
sorry
dear
i
am
glad
you
do
look
fit
for
any
troublesome
jobs
i
am
fit
enough
said
alice
do
put
up
the
curtains
i
come
and
do
it
you
must
come
with
a
stronger
face
then
said
her
old
friend
have
you
wearied
yourself
with
walking
all
this
way
i
was
a
little
weary
said
alice
but
your
nice
tea
has
made
me
up
again
i
wish
i
could
keep
you
all
night
said
vawse
looking
out
but
your
father
would
be
uneasy
i
am
afraid
the
storm
will
catch
you
before
you
get
home
and
you
are
fit
to
breast
it
little
ellen
too
look
as
if
she
was
made
of
iron
ca
you
stay
with
me
i
must
not
it
would
do
said
alice
who
was
hastily
putting
on
her
things
we
soon
run
down
the
hill
but
we
are
leaving
you
alone
where
nancy
she
not
come
if
there
a
promise
of
a
storm
said
vawse
she
often
stays
out
all
night
and
leaves
you
alone
i
am
never
alone
said
the
old
lady
quietly
i
have
nothing
to
fear
but
i
am
uneasy
about
you
dear
mind
my
words
do
try
to
go
back
the
way
you
came
take
the
other
road
it
easier
and
stop
when
you
get
to
van
brunt
van
brunt
will
take
you
the
rest
of
the
way
in
his
little
waggon
do
you
think
it
is
needful
said
alice
doubtfully
i
am
sure
it
is
best
hasten
down
adieu
mon
enfant
they
kissed
and
embraced
her
and
hurried
out
chapter
xix
november
chill
blaws
loud
wi
angry
sough
the
shortening
winter
day
is
near
a
close
burns
the
clouds
hung
thick
and
low
the
wind
was
less
than
it
had
been
they
took
the
path
vawse
had
spoken
of
it
was
broader
and
easier
than
the
other
winding
more
gently
down
the
mountain
it
was
sometimes
indeed
travelled
by
horses
though
far
too
steep
for
any
kind
of
carriage
alice
and
ellen
ran
along
without
giving
much
heed
to
anything
but
their
footing
down
down
running
and
bounding
hand
in
hand
till
want
of
breath
obliged
them
to
slacken
their
pace
do
you
think
it
will
snow
soon
asked
ellen
i
think
it
will
snow
how
soon
i
can
not
tell
have
you
had
a
pleasant
afternoon
oh
very
i
always
have
when
i
go
there
now
ellen
there
is
an
example
of
contentment
for
you
if
ever
a
woman
loved
husband
and
children
and
friends
vawse
loved
hers
i
know
this
from
those
who
knew
her
long
ago
and
now
look
at
her
of
them
all
she
has
none
left
but
the
orphan
daughter
of
her
youngest
son
and
you
know
a
little
what
sort
of
a
child
that
is
she
must
be
a
very
bad
girl
said
ellen
you
ca
think
what
stories
she
told
me
about
her
grandmother
poor
nancy
said
alice
vawse
has
no
money
nor
property
of
any
kind
except
what
is
in
her
house
but
there
is
not
a
more
independent
woman
breathing
she
does
all
sorts
of
things
to
support
herself
now
for
instance
ellen
if
anybody
is
sick
within
ten
miles
round
the
family
are
too
happy
to
get
vawse
for
a
nurse
she
is
an
admirable
one
then
she
goes
out
tailoring
at
the
farmers
houses
she
brings
home
wool
and
returns
it
spun
into
yarn
she
brings
home
yarn
and
knits
it
up
into
stockings
and
socks
all
sorts
of
odd
jobs
i
have
seen
her
picking
hops
she
is
above
doing
anything
and
yet
she
never
forgets
her
own
dignity
i
think
wherever
she
goes
and
whatever
she
is
about
she
is
at
all
times
one
of
the
most
truly
ladylike
persons
i
have
ever
seen
and
everybody
respects
her
everybody
likes
to
gain
her
goodwill
she
is
known
all
over
the
country
and
all
the
country
are
her
friends
they
pay
her
for
doing
these
things
do
they
certainly
not
often
in
money
more
commonly
in
various
kinds
of
matters
that
she
wants
flour
and
sugar
and
indian
meal
and
pork
and
ham
and
vegetables
and
wool
anything
it
is
but
a
little
of
each
that
she
wants
she
has
friends
that
would
not
permit
her
to
earn
another
sixpence
if
they
could
help
it
but
she
likes
better
to
live
as
she
does
and
she
is
always
as
you
saw
her
cheerful
and
happy
as
a
little
girl
ellen
was
turning
over
alice
last
words
and
thinking
that
little
girls
were
not
the
cheerfullest
and
happiest
creatures
in
the
world
when
alice
suddenly
exclaimed
it
is
snowing
come
ellen
we
must
make
haste
now
and
set
off
at
a
quickened
pace
quick
as
they
might
they
had
gone
not
a
hundred
yards
when
the
whole
air
was
filled
with
the
falling
flakes
and
the
wind
which
had
lulled
for
a
little
now
rose
with
greater
violence
and
swept
round
the
mountain
furiously
the
storm
had
come
in
good
earnest
and
promised
to
be
no
trifling
one
alice
and
ellen
ran
on
holding
each
other
hands
and
strengthening
themselves
against
the
blast
but
their
journey
became
every
moment
more
difficult
the
air
was
dark
with
the
snow
the
wind
seemed
to
blow
in
every
direction
by
turns
but
chiefly
against
them
blinding
their
eyes
with
the
snow
and
making
it
necessary
to
use
no
small
effort
to
keep
on
their
way
ellen
hardly
knew
where
she
went
but
allowed
herself
to
be
pulled
along
by
alice
or
as
well
pulled
along
it
was
hard
to
say
which
hurried
most
in
the
midst
of
this
dashing
on
down
the
hill
alice
all
at
once
came
to
a
sudden
stop
where
the
captain
said
she
i
do
know
said
ellen
i
have
thought
of
him
since
we
left
mrs
vawse
alice
turned
her
back
to
the
wind
and
looked
up
the
road
they
had
come
there
was
nothing
but
wind
and
snow
there
how
furiously
it
blew
alice
called
pussy
shall
we
walk
up
the
road
a
little
way
or
shall
we
stand
and
wait
for
him
here
said
ellen
trembling
half
from
exertion
and
half
from
a
vague
fear
of
she
knew
not
what
alice
called
again
no
answer
but
a
wild
gust
of
wind
and
snow
that
drove
past
i
ca
go
on
and
leave
him
said
alice
he
might
perish
in
the
storm
and
she
began
to
walk
slowly
back
calling
at
intervals
pussy
kitty
pussy
and
listening
for
an
answer
that
came
not
ellen
was
very
unwilling
to
tarry
and
nowise
inclined
to
prolong
their
journey
by
going
backwards
she
thought
the
storm
grew
darker
and
wilder
every
moment
perhaps
captain
stayed
up
at
vawse
she
said
and
follow
us
down
no
said
alice
i
am
sure
he
did
hark
was
that
he
i
do
hear
anything
said
ellen
after
a
pause
of
anxious
listening
alice
went
a
few
steps
further
i
hear
him
she
said
i
hear
him
poor
kitty
and
she
set
off
at
a
quick
pace
up
the
hill
ellen
followed
but
presently
a
burst
of
wind
and
snow
brought
them
both
to
a
stand
alice
faltered
a
little
at
this
in
doubt
whether
to
go
up
or
down
but
then
to
their
great
joy
cry
was
heard
and
both
alice
and
ellen
strained
their
voices
to
cheer
and
direct
him
in
a
few
minutes
he
came
in
sight
trotting
hurriedly
along
through
the
snow
and
on
reaching
his
mistress
he
sat
down
immediately
on
the
ground
without
offering
any
caress
a
sure
sign
that
he
was
tired
alice
stooped
down
and
took
him
up
in
her
arms
poor
kitty
she
said
you
done
your
part
for
i
think
do
the
rest
ellen
dear
it
of
no
use
to
tire
ourselves
out
at
once
we
will
go
moderately
keep
hold
of
my
cloak
my
child
it
takes
both
of
my
arms
to
hold
this
big
cat
now
never
mind
the
snow
we
can
bear
being
blown
about
a
little
are
you
very
tired
no
said
ellen
not
very
i
am
a
little
tired
but
i
do
care
for
that
if
we
can
only
get
home
safe
there
no
difficulty
about
that
i
hope
nay
there
may
be
some
but
we
shall
get
there
i
think
in
good
safety
after
a
while
i
wish
we
were
there
now
for
your
sake
my
child
oh
never
mind
me
said
ellen
gratefully
i
am
sorry
for
miss
alice
you
have
the
hardest
time
of
it
with
that
heavy
load
to
carry
i
wish
i
could
help
you
thank
you
my
dear
but
nobody
could
do
that
i
doubt
if
captain
would
lie
in
any
arms
but
mine
let
me
carry
the
basket
then
said
ellen
do
miss
alice
no
my
dear
it
hangs
very
well
on
my
arm
take
it
gently
van
brunt
is
very
far
off
we
shall
feel
the
wind
less
when
we
turn
but
the
road
seemed
long
the
storm
did
not
increase
in
violence
truly
there
was
no
need
of
that
but
the
turning
was
not
soon
found
and
the
gathering
darkness
warned
them
day
was
drawing
towards
a
close
as
they
neared
the
bottom
of
the
hill
alice
made
a
pause
there
a
path
that
turns
off
from
this
and
makes
a
shorter
cut
to
van
brunt
but
it
must
be
above
here
i
must
have
missed
it
though
i
have
been
on
the
watch
constantly
she
looked
up
and
down
it
would
have
been
a
sharp
eye
indeed
that
had
detected
any
slight
opening
in
the
woods
on
either
side
of
the
path
which
the
driving
snowstorm
blended
into
one
continuous
wall
of
trees
they
could
be
seen
stretching
darkly
before
and
behind
them
but
more
than
that
where
they
stood
near
together
and
where
scattered
apart
was
all
confusion
through
that
shower
of
flakes
shall
we
go
back
and
look
for
the
path
said
ellen
i
am
afraid
we
should
find
it
if
we
did
said
alice
we
should
only
lose
our
time
and
we
have
none
to
lose
i
think
we
had
better
go
straight
forward
is
it
much
further
this
way
than
the
other
path
we
have
missed
a
good
deal
all
of
half
a
mile
i
am
sorry
but
courage
my
child
we
shall
know
better
than
to
go
out
in
snowy
weather
next
time
on
long
expeditions
at
least
they
had
to
shout
to
make
each
other
hear
so
drove
the
snow
and
wind
through
the
trees
and
into
their
very
faces
and
ears
they
plodded
on
it
was
plodding
the
snow
lay
thick
enough
now
to
make
their
footing
uneasy
and
grew
deeper
every
moment
their
shoes
were
full
their
feet
and
ankles
were
wet
and
their
steps
began
to
drag
heavily
over
the
ground
ellen
clung
as
close
to
alice
cloak
as
their
hurried
travelling
would
permit
sometimes
one
of
alice
hands
was
loosened
for
a
moment
to
be
passed
round
ellen
shoulders
and
a
word
of
courage
or
comfort
in
the
clear
calm
tone
cheered
her
to
renewed
exertion
the
night
fell
fast
it
was
very
darkling
by
the
time
they
reached
the
bottom
of
the
hill
and
the
road
did
not
yet
allow
them
to
turn
their
faces
towards
van
brunt
a
wearisome
piece
of
the
way
this
was
leading
them
the
place
they
wished
to
reach
they
could
not
go
fast
either
they
were
too
weary
and
the
walking
too
heavy
captain
had
the
best
of
it
snug
and
quiet
he
lay
wrapped
in
alice
cloak
and
fast
asleep
little
wotting
how
tired
his
mistress
arms
were
the
path
at
length
brought
them
to
the
turning
but
it
was
by
this
time
so
dark
that
the
fences
on
each
side
of
the
road
showed
but
dimly
they
had
not
spoken
for
a
while
as
they
turned
the
corner
a
sigh
of
mingled
weariness
and
satisfaction
escaped
from
ellen
lips
it
reached
alice
ear
what
the
matter
love
said
the
sweet
voice
no
trace
of
weariness
was
allowed
to
come
into
it
i
am
so
glad
we
have
got
here
at
last
said
ellen
looking
up
with
another
sigh
and
removing
her
hand
for
an
instant
from
its
grasp
on
the
cloak
to
alice
arm
my
poor
child
i
wish
i
could
carry
you
too
can
you
hold
on
a
little
longer
oh
yes
dear
miss
alice
i
can
hold
on
but
ellen
voice
was
not
so
well
guarded
it
was
like
her
steps
a
little
unsteady
she
presently
spoke
again
miss
alice
are
you
afraid
i
am
afraid
of
your
getting
sick
my
child
and
a
little
afraid
of
it
for
myself
of
nothing
else
what
is
there
to
be
afraid
of
it
is
very
dark
said
ellen
and
the
storm
is
so
thick
do
you
think
you
can
find
the
way
i
know
it
perfectly
it
is
nothing
but
to
keep
straight
on
and
the
fences
would
prevent
us
from
getting
out
of
the
road
it
is
hard
walking
i
know
but
we
shall
get
there
bear
up
as
well
as
you
can
dear
i
am
sorry
i
can
give
you
no
help
but
words
do
you
think
a
nice
bright
fire
will
look
comfortable
after
all
this
oh
dear
yes
answered
ellen
rather
sadly
are
afraid
ellen
no
miss
alice
not
much
i
do
like
it
being
so
dark
i
ca
see
where
i
am
going
the
darkness
makes
our
way
longer
and
more
tedious
it
will
do
us
no
other
harm
love
i
wish
i
had
a
hand
to
give
you
but
this
great
cat
must
have
both
of
mine
the
darkness
and
the
light
are
both
alike
to
our
father
we
are
in
his
hands
we
are
safe
enough
dear
ellen
ellen
hand
left
the
cloak
again
for
an
instant
to
press
alice
arm
in
answer
her
voice
failed
at
the
minute
then
clinging
anew
as
close
to
her
side
as
she
could
get
they
toiled
patiently
on
the
wind
had
somewhat
lessened
of
its
violence
and
besides
it
blew
not
now
in
their
faces
but
against
their
backs
helping
them
on
still
the
snow
continued
to
fall
very
fast
and
already
lay
thick
upon
the
ground
every
increased
the
heaviness
and
painfulness
of
their
march
and
darkness
gathered
till
the
very
fences
could
no
longer
be
seen
it
was
pitch
dark
to
hold
the
middle
of
the
road
was
impossible
their
only
way
was
to
keep
along
by
one
of
the
fences
and
for
fear
of
hurting
themselves
against
some
outstanding
post
or
stone
it
was
necessary
to
travel
quite
gently
they
were
indeed
in
no
condition
to
travel
otherwise
if
light
had
not
been
wanting
slowly
and
patiently
with
painful
care
groping
their
way
they
pushed
on
through
the
snow
and
the
thick
night
alice
could
the
earnestness
of
ellen
grasp
upon
her
clothes
and
her
close
pressing
up
to
her
made
their
progress
still
slower
and
more
difficult
than
it
would
otherwise
have
been
miss
alice
said
ellen
what
my
child
i
wish
you
would
speak
to
me
once
in
a
while
alice
freed
one
of
her
hands
and
took
hold
of
ellen
i
have
been
so
busy
picking
my
way
along
i
have
neglected
you
i
oh
no
but
i
like
to
hear
the
sound
of
your
voice
sometimes
it
makes
me
feel
better
this
is
an
odd
kind
of
travelling
is
it
said
alice
cheerfully
in
the
dark
and
feeling
our
way
along
this
will
be
quite
an
adventure
to
talk
about
wo
it
quite
said
ellen
it
is
easier
going
this
way
do
you
find
it
so
the
wind
helps
us
forward
it
helps
me
too
much
said
ellen
i
wish
it
would
be
quite
so
very
kind
why
miss
alice
i
have
enough
to
do
to
hold
myself
together
sometimes
it
almost
makes
me
run
though
i
am
so
very
tired
well
it
is
better
than
having
it
in
our
faces
at
any
rate
tired
you
are
i
know
and
must
be
we
shall
want
to
rest
all
day
sha
we
oh
i
do
know
said
ellen
sighing
i
shall
be
glad
when
we
begin
how
long
do
you
think
it
will
be
miss
alice
before
we
get
to
van
brunt
my
dear
child
i
can
not
tell
you
i
have
not
the
least
notion
whereabouts
we
are
i
can
see
no
waymarks
and
i
can
not
judge
at
all
of
the
rate
at
which
we
have
come
but
what
if
we
should
have
passed
it
in
this
darkness
said
ellen
no
i
do
think
that
said
alice
though
a
cold
doubt
struck
her
mind
at
ellen
words
i
think
we
shall
see
the
glimmer
of
van
brunt
family
candle
but
more
uneasily
and
more
keenly
now
she
strove
to
see
that
glimmer
through
the
darkness
strove
till
the
darkness
seemed
to
press
painfully
upon
her
eyeballs
and
she
almost
doubted
her
being
able
to
see
any
light
if
light
there
were
it
was
all
blank
thick
darkness
still
she
began
to
question
anxiously
with
herself
which
side
of
the
house
was
van
brunt
ordinary
whether
she
should
see
the
light
from
it
before
or
after
passing
the
house
and
now
her
glance
was
directed
often
behind
her
that
they
might
be
sure
in
any
case
of
not
missing
their
desired
haven
in
vain
she
looked
forward
or
back
it
was
all
one
no
cheering
glimmer
of
lamp
or
candle
greeted
her
straining
eyes
hurriedly
now
from
time
to
time
the
comforting
words
were
spoken
to
ellen
for
to
pursue
the
long
stretch
of
way
that
led
onward
from
van
brunt
to
miss
fortune
would
be
a
very
serious
matter
alice
wanted
comfort
herself
shall
we
get
there
soon
do
you
think
miss
alice
said
poor
ellen
whose
wearied
feet
carried
her
painfully
over
the
deepening
snow
the
tone
of
voice
went
to
alice
heart
i
do
know
my
darling
i
hope
so
she
answered
but
it
was
spoken
rather
patiently
than
cheerfully
fear
nothing
dear
ellen
remember
who
has
the
care
of
us
darkness
and
light
are
both
alike
to
him
nothing
will
do
us
any
real
harm
how
tired
you
must
be
dear
miss
alice
carrying
pussy
ellen
said
with
a
sigh
for
the
first
time
alice
echoed
the
sigh
but
almost
immediately
ellen
exclaimed
in
a
totally
different
tone
there
a
light
but
it
is
a
candle
it
is
moving
about
what
is
it
what
is
it
miss
alice
they
stopped
and
looked
a
light
there
certainly
was
dimly
seen
moving
at
some
little
distance
from
the
fence
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
all
of
a
sudden
it
disappeared
what
is
it
whispered
ellen
fearfully
i
do
know
my
love
yet
wait
they
waited
several
minutes
what
could
it
be
said
ellen
it
was
certainly
a
light
i
saw
it
as
plainly
as
ever
i
saw
anything
what
can
it
have
done
with
itself
there
it
is
again
going
the
other
way
alice
waited
no
longer
but
screamed
out
who
there
but
the
light
paid
no
attention
to
her
cry
it
travelled
on
halloo
called
alice
again
as
loud
as
she
could
halloo
answered
a
rough
deep
voice
the
light
suddenly
stopped
that
he
that
he
exclaimed
ellen
in
an
ecstasy
and
almost
dancing
i
know
it
it
van
brunt
it
van
brunt
oh
miss
alice
struggling
between
crying
and
laughing
ellen
could
not
stand
it
but
gave
way
to
a
good
fit
of
crying
alice
felt
the
infection
but
controlled
herself
though
her
eyes
watered
as
her
heart
sent
up
its
grateful
tribute
as
well
as
she
could
she
answered
the
halloo
the
light
was
seen
advancing
towards
them
presently
it
glimmered
faintly
behind
the
fence
showing
a
bit
of
the
dark
rails
covered
with
snow
and
they
could
dimly
see
the
figure
of
a
man
getting
over
them
he
crossed
the
road
to
where
they
stood
it
was
van
brunt
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
van
brunt
said
alice
sweet
voice
but
it
trembled
a
little
that
gentleman
at
first
dumb
with
astonishment
lifted
his
lantern
to
survey
them
and
assure
his
eyes
that
his
ears
had
not
been
mistaken
miss
alice
my
goodness
alive
how
in
the
name
of
wonder
and
my
poor
little
lamb
but
what
on
you
must
be
half
dead
come
this
way
just
come
back
a
little
bit
why
where
were
you
going
to
your
house
van
brunt
i
have
been
looking
for
it
with
no
little
anxiety
i
assure
you
looking
for
it
why
how
on
you
would
see
the
biggest
house
ever
was
built
half
a
yard
off
such
a
plaguy
night
as
this
i
thought
i
should
see
the
light
from
the
windows
van
brunt
the
light
from
the
windows
bless
my
soul
the
storm
rattled
so
again
the
windows
that
mother
made
me
pull
the
great
shutters
to
i
wo
have
shut
again
of
a
stormy
night
that
a
fact
you
ha
gone
far
enough
afore
you
ha
seen
the
light
through
them
shutters
then
we
had
passed
the
house
already
had
we
indeed
had
you
i
guess
you
saw
my
light
you
yes
and
glad
enough
we
were
to
see
it
too
i
suppose
so
it
happened
so
now
that
is
a
queer
thing
i
minded
that
i
had
untied
my
horse
he
a
trick
of
being
untied
at
night
and
wo
sleep
well
if
he
ai
and
mother
wanted
me
to
let
him
alone
of
the
awful
storm
but
i
could
go
to
my
bed
in
peace
till
i
had
seen
him
to
so
that
how
my
lantern
came
to
be
going
to
the
barn
in
such
an
night
as
this
they
had
reached
the
little
gate
and
van
brunt
with
some
difficulty
pulled
it
open
the
snow
lay
thick
upon
the
neat
brick
walk
which
ellen
had
trod
the
first
time
with
wet
feet
and
dripping
garments
a
few
steps
farther
and
they
came
to
the
same
door
that
had
opened
then
so
hospitably
to
receive
her
as
the
faint
light
of
the
lantern
was
thrown
upon
the
old
latch
and
ellen
felt
at
home
and
a
sense
of
comfort
sank
down
into
her
heart
which
she
had
not
known
for
some
time
chapter

true
is
that
whilome
that
good
poet
said
the
gentle
minde
by
gentle

is
knowne
for
a
man
by
nothing
is
so
well
bewrayed
as
by
his
manners
in
which
plaine
is
showne
of
what
degree
and
what

he
is
growne
faerie
queene
van
brunt
flung
open
the
door
and
the
two
wet
and
weary
travellers
stepped
after
him
into
the
same
cheerful
kitchen
that
had
received
ellen
once
before
just
the
same
tidy
up
a
good
fire
and
the
same
old
chairs
standing
round
on
the
hearth
in
most
cosy
fashion
it
seemed
to
ellen
a
perfect
storehouse
of
comfort
the
very
walls
had
a
kind
face
for
her
there
were
no
other
faces
however
the
chairs
were
all
empty
van
brunt
put
alice
in
one
and
ellen
in
another
and
shouted
mother
here
muttering
that
she
had
taken
herself
off
with
the
light
somewhere
not
very
far
for
in
half
a
minute
answering
the
call
van
brunt
and
the
light
came
hurriedly
in
what
the
matter
who
this
why
miss
alice
my
gracious
me
and
all
wet
oh
dear
dear
poor
lamb
why
miss
alice
dear
where
have
you
been
and
if
that
ai
my
little
ellen
oh
dear
what
a
fix
you
are
in
well
darling
i
glad
to
see
you
again
any
way
she
crossed
over
to
kiss
ellen
as
she
said
this
but
surprise
was
not
more
quickly
alive
than
kindness
and
hospitality
she
fell
to
work
immediately
to
remove
alice
wet
things
and
to
do
whatever
their
joint
prudence
and
experience
might
suggest
to
ward
off
any
ill
effects
from
the
fatigue
and
exposure
the
wanderers
had
suffered
and
while
she
was
thus
employed
van
brunt
busied
himself
with
ellen
who
was
really
in
no
condition
to
help
herself
it
was
curious
to
see
him
carefully
taking
off
ellen
wet
hood
not
the
blue
one
and
knocking
it
gently
to
get
rid
of
the
snow
evidently
thinking
that
ladies
things
must
have
delicate
handling
he
tried
the
cloak
next
but
boggled
sadly
at
the
fastening
of
that
and
at
last
was
fain
to
call
in
help
here
nancy
where
are
you
step
here
and
see
if
you
can
undo
this
here
thing
whatever
you
call
it
i
believe
my
fingers
are
too
big
for
it
it
was
ellen
former
acquaintance
who
came
forward
in
obedience
to
this
call
ellen
had
not
seen
before
that
she
was
in
the
room
nancy
grinned
a
mischievous
smile
of
recognition
as
she
stooped
to
throat
and
undid
the
fastening
of
the
cloak
and
then
shortly
enough
bade
her
get
up
that
she
might
take
it
off
ellen
obeyed
but
was
very
glad
to
sit
down
again
while
nancy
went
to
the
door
to
shake
the
cloak
van
brunt
was
gently
pulling
off
ellen
wet
gloves
and
on
nancy
return
he
directed
her
to
take
off
the
shoes
which
were
filled
with
snow
nancy
sat
down
on
the
floor
before
ellen
to
obey
this
order
and
tired
and
exhausted
as
she
was
ellen
felt
the
different
manner
in
which
her
hands
and
feet
were
waited
upon
how
did
you
get
into
this
scrape
said
nancy
was
none
of
my
doings
anyhow
it
never
be
dry
weather
ellen
where
you
are
i
wo
put
on
my
sunday
clothes
when
i
go
with
you
you
had
ought
to
ha
been
a
duck
or
a
goose
or
something
like
that
what
that
for
van
brunt
this
last
query
pretty
sharply
spoken
was
in
answer
to
a
light
touch
of
that
gentleman
hand
upon
miss
nancy
ear
which
came
rather
as
a
surprise
he
deigned
no
reply
you
a
fine
gentleman
said
nancy
tartly
have
you
done
what
i
gave
you
to
do
said
van
brunt
coolly
yes
there
said
nancy
holding
up
ellen
bare
feet
on
one
hand
while
the
fingers
of
the
other
secretly
applied
in
ticklish
fashion
to
the
soles
of
them
caused
ellen
suddenly
to
start
and
scream
get
up
said
van
brunt
nancy
did
think
best
to
disobey
mother
you
got
nothing
you
want
nancy
to
do
sally
said
van
brunt
you
and
nancy
go
and
fetch
here
a
couple
of
pails
of
hot
water
right
away
go
and
mind
what
you
are
about
said
van
brunt
and
after
that
keep
out
of
this
room
and
do
whisper
again
till
i
give
you
leave
now
miss
ellen
dear
how
do
you
feel
ellen
said
in
words
that
she
felt
nicely
but
the
eyes
and
the
smile
said
a
great
deal
more
ellen
heart
was
running
over
oh
she
feel
nicely
i
be
bound
said
van
brunt
wait
till
she
gets
her
feet
soaked
and
then
i
do
feel
nicely
now
said
ellen
and
alice
smiled
in
answer
to
their
inquiries
and
said
if
she
only
knew
her
father
was
easy
there
would
be
nothing
wanting
to
her
happiness
the
bathing
of
their
feet
was
a
great
refreshment
and
their
kind
hostess
had
got
ready
a
plentiful
supply
of
hot
herb
tea
with
which
both
alice
and
ellen
were
well
dosed
while
they
sat
sipping
this
toasting
their
feet
before
the
fire
van
brunt
and
the
girls
meanwhile
preparing
their
room
van
brunt
suddenly
entered
he
was
cloaked
and
hatted
and
had
a
riding
whip
in
his
hand
is
there
any
word
you
like
to
get
home
miss
alice
i
going
to
ride
a
good
piece
that
way
and
i
can
stop
as
good
as
not
van
brunt
exclaimed
alice
in
astonishment
van
brunt
silence
seemed
to
say
that
was
the
time
and
no
other
but
the
storm
is
too
bad
urged
alice
pray
do
go
till
pray
do
van
brunt
said
ellen
ca
help
it
i
got
business
must
go
what
shall
i
say
i
should
be
glad
said
alice
to
have
my
father
know
where
i
am
are
you
going
very
near
the
nose
very
near
then
i
shall
be
greatly
obliged
if
you
will
be
so
kind
as
to
stop
and
relieve
my
father
anxiety
but
how
can
you
go
in
such
weather
and
so
dark
as
it
is
never
fear
said
van
brunt
we
be
back
in
if
and
me
do
come
across
a
a
too
deep
and
out
he
went
in
said
alice
musing
why
he
said
he
had
been
to
untie
his
horse
for
the
night
he
must
be
going
on
our
account
i
am
sure
ellen
on
account
said
ellen
smiling
oh
i
knew
that
all
the
time
miss
alice
i
do
think
he
stop
to
relieve
aunt
fortune
anxiety
alice
sprang
to
call
him
back
but
van
brunt
assured
her
it
was
too
late
and
that
she
need
not
be
uneasy
for
her
son
did
mind
the
storm
no
more
than
a
and
could
go
anywhere
in
any
sort
of
a
time
he
was
agoing
without
speaking
to
you
but
i
told
him
he
had
better
for
maybe
you
wanted
to
send
some
word
particular
and
your
room
ready
now
dear
and
you
better
go
to
bed
and
sleep
as
long
as
you
can
they
went
thankfully
is
this
a
pleasant
room
said
ellen
who
saw
everything
in
and
a
nice
bed
but
i
feel
as
if
i
could
sleep
on
the
floor
is
it
worth
while
to
have
such
a
time
miss
alice
for
the
sake
of
the
pleasure
afterwards
i
do
know
ellen
said
alice
smiling
i
wo
say
that
though
it
is
worth
paying
a
price
for
to
find
how
much
kindness
there
is
in
some
people
hearts
as
to
sleeping
on
the
floor
i
must
say
i
never
felt
less
inclined
to
it
well
i
am
tired
enough
too
said
ellen
as
they
laid
themselves
down
two
nights
with
you
in
a
week
oh
those
weeks
before
i
saw
you
miss
alice
one
earnest
kiss
for
good
night
and
ellen
sigh
of
pleasure
on
touching
the
pillow
was
scarcely
breathed
when
sleep
deep
and
sound
fell
upon
her
eyelids
it
was
very
late
next
morning
when
they
awoke
having
slept
rather
heavily
than
well
they
crawled
out
of
bed
feeling
stiff
and
sore
in
every
limb
each
confessing
to
more
evil
effects
from
their
adventure
than
she
had
been
aware
of
the
evening
before
all
the
rubbing
and
bathing
and
drinking
that
van
brunt
had
administered
had
been
too
little
to
undo
what
wet
and
cold
and
fatigue
had
done
but
van
brunt
had
set
her
with
everything
her
house
could
furnish
that
was
nice
a
board
it
was
humphreys
was
there
too
and
no
bad
feelings
of
two
of
the
party
could
prevent
that
from
being
a
most
cheerful
and
pleasant
meal
even
mr
humphreys
and
van
brunt
two
persons
not
usually
given
to
many
words
came
out
wonderfully
on
this
occasion
gratitude
and
pleasure
in
the
one
and
generous
feeling
on
the
part
of
the
other
untied
their
tongues
and
ellen
looked
from
one
to
the
other
in
some
amazement
to
see
how
agreeable
they
could
be
kindness
and
hospitality
always
kept
van
brunt
in
full
flow
and
alice
whatever
she
felt
exerted
herself
and
supplied
what
was
wanting
everywhere
like
the
transparent
glazing
which
painters
use
to
spread
over
the
dead
colour
of
their
pictures
unknown
it
was
she
gave
her
life
and
harmony
to
the
whole
and
ellen
in
her
enjoyment
of
everything
and
everybody
forgot
or
despised
aches
and
pains
and
even
whispered
to
alice
that
coffee
was
making
her
well
again
but
happily
breakfasts
must
come
to
an
end
and
so
did
this
prolonged
though
it
was
immediately
after
the
party
whom
circumstances
had
gathered
for
the
first
and
probably
the
last
time
scattered
again
but
the
meeting
had
left
pleasant
effects
on
all
minds
van
brunt
was
in
general
delight
that
she
had
entertained
so
many
people
she
thought
a
great
deal
of
and
particularly
glad
of
the
chance
of
showing
her
kind
feelings
towards
two
of
the
number
humphreys
remarked
upon
that
very
sensible
man
van
brunt
towards
whom
he
felt
himself
under
great
obligation
van
brunt
said
the
minister
war
such
a
grum
man
as
people
called
him
and
moreover
said
it
was
a
good
thing
to
have
an
education
and
he
had
a
notion
to
read
more
as
for
alice
and
ellen
they
went
away
full
of
kind
feeling
for
every
one
and
much
love
to
each
other
this
was
true
of
them
before
but
their
late
troubles
had
drawn
them
closer
together
and
given
them
fresh
occasion
to
value
their
friends
humphreys
had
brought
the
little
sleigh
for
his
daughter
and
soon
after
breakfast
ellen
saw
it
drive
off
with
her
van
brunt
then
harnessed
his
own
and
carried
ellen
home
ill
though
she
felt
the
poor
child
made
an
effort
and
spent
part
of
the
morning
in
finishing
the
long
letter
to
her
mother
which
had
been
on
the
stocks
since
monday
the
effort
became
painful
towards
the
last
and
the
aching
limbs
and
trembling
hand
of
which
she
complained
were
the
first
beginnings
of
a
serious
fit
of
illness
she
went
to
bed
that
same
afternoon
and
did
not
leave
it
again
for
two
weeks
cold
had
taken
violent
hold
of
her
system
fever
set
in
and
ran
high
and
half
the
time
little
ellen
wits
were
roving
in
delirium
nothing
however
could
be
too
much
for
miss
energies
she
was
as
much
at
home
in
a
sick
room
as
in
a
well
one
she
flew
about
with
increased
agility
was
upstairs
and
downstairs
twenty
times
in
the
course
of
the
day
and
kept
all
straight
everywhere
ellen
room
was
always
the
picture
of
neatness
the
fire
the
was
taken
care
of
miss
fortune
seemed
to
know
by
instinct
when
it
wanted
a
fresh
supply
and
to
be
on
the
spot
by
magic
to
give
it
ellen
medicines
were
dealt
out
in
proper
time
her
gruels
and
drinks
perfectly
well
made
and
arranged
with
appetising
nicety
on
a
little
table
by
the
bedside
where
she
could
reach
them
herself
and
miss
fortune
was
generally
at
hand
when
she
was
wanted
but
in
spite
of
all
this
there
was
something
missing
in
that
sick
room
there
was
a
great
want
and
whenever
the
delirium
was
upon
her
ellen
made
no
secret
of
it
she
was
never
violent
but
she
moaned
sometimes
impatiently
and
sometimes
plaintively
for
her
mother
it
was
a
vexation
to
miss
fortune
to
hear
her
the
name
of
her
mother
was
all
the
time
on
her
lips
if
by
chance
her
aunt
name
came
in
it
was
spoken
in
a
way
that
generally
sent
her
bouncing
out
of
the
room
mamma
poor
ellen
would
say
just
lay
your
hand
on
my
forehead
will
you
it
so
hot
oh
do
mamma
where
are
you
do
put
your
hand
on
my
forehead
wo
you
oh
do
speak
to
me
why
do
you
mamma
oh
why
do
she
come
to
me
once
when
ellen
was
uneasily
calling
in
this
fashion
for
her
hand
miss
fortune
softly
laid
her
own
upon
the
child
brow
but
the
quick
sudden
jerk
of
the
head
from
under
it
told
her
how
well
ellen
knew
the
one
from
the
other
and
little
as
she
cared
for
ellen
it
was
wormwood
to
her
miss
fortune
was
not
without
offers
of
help
during
this
sick
time
van
brunt
and
afterwards
vawse
asked
leave
to
come
and
nurse
ellen
but
miss
fortune
declared
it
was
more
plague
than
profit
to
her
and
she
could
be
bothered
with
having
strangers
about
van
brunt
she
suffered
much
against
her
will
to
come
for
a
day
or
two
at
the
end
of
that
miss
fortune
found
means
to
get
rid
of
her
civilly
vawse
she
would
not
allow
to
stay
an
hour
the
old
lady
got
leave
however
to
go
up
to
the
for
a
few
minutes
ellen
who
was
then
in
a
high
fever
informed
her
that
her
mother
was
downstairs
and
her
aunt
fortune
would
not
let
her
come
up
she
pleaded
with
tears
that
she
might
come
and
entreated
vawse
to
take
her
aunt
away
and
send
her
mother
vawse
tried
to
soothe
her
miss
fortune
grew
impatient
what
on
earth
the
use
said
she
of
talking
to
a
child
that
out
of
her
head
she
ca
hear
reason
that
the
way
she
gets
into
whenever
the
fever
on
her
i
have
the
pleasure
of
hearing
that
sort
of
thing
all
the
time
come
away
vawse
and
leave
her
she
ca
be
better
any
way
than
alone
and
i
am
in
the
room
every
other
thing
just
as
well
quiet
nobody
knows
said
miss
fortune
on
her
way
downstairs
nobody
knows
the
blessing
of
taking
care
of
other
children
that
tried
it
tried
it
to
my
heart
content
vawse
sighed
but
departed
in
silence
it
was
not
when
the
fever
was
on
her
and
delirium
high
that
ellen
most
felt
the
want
she
then
so
pitifully
made
known
there
were
other
times
when
her
head
was
aching
and
weary
and
weak
she
lay
still
there
oh
how
she
longed
then
for
the
dear
wonted
face
the
old
quiet
smile
that
carried
so
much
of
comfort
and
assurance
with
it
the
voice
that
was
like
heaven
music
the
touch
of
that
loved
hand
to
which
she
had
clung
for
so
many
years
she
could
scarcely
bear
to
think
of
it
sometimes
in
the
still
wakeful
hours
of
night
when
the
only
sound
to
be
heard
was
the
heavy
breathing
of
her
aunt
asleep
on
the
floor
by
her
side
and
in
the
long
solitary
day
when
the
only
variety
to
be
looked
for
was
miss
fortune
flitting
in
and
out
and
there
came
to
be
a
sameness
about
that
ellen
mourned
her
loss
bitterly
many
and
many
were
the
silent
tears
that
rolled
down
and
wet
her
pillow
many
a
sigh
came
from
the
very
bottom
of
ellen
heart
she
was
too
weak
and
subdued
now
for
violent
weeping
she
wondered
sadly
why
alice
did
not
come
to
see
her
it
was
another
great
grief
added
to
the
former
she
never
chose
however
to
mention
her
name
to
her
aunt
she
kept
her
wonder
and
her
sorrow
to
herself
all
the
harder
to
bear
for
that
after
two
weeks
ellen
began
to
mend
and
then
she
became
exceeding
weary
of
being
alone
and
shut
up
to
her
room
it
was
a
pleasure
to
have
her
bible
and
lying
upon
the
bed
and
a
great
comfort
when
she
was
able
to
look
at
a
few
words
but
that
was
not
very
often
and
she
longed
to
see
somebody
and
hear
something
besides
her
aunt
dry
questions
and
answers
one
afternoon
ellen
was
sitting
alone
as
usual
bolstered
up
in
bed
her
little
was
clasped
in
her
hand
though
not
equal
to
reading
she
felt
the
touch
of
it
a
solace
half
dozing
half
waking
she
had
been
perfectly
quiet
for
some
time
when
the
sudden
and
not
very
gentle
opening
of
the
room
door
caused
her
to
start
and
open
her
eyes
they
opened
wider
than
usual
for
instead
of
her
aunt
fortune
it
was
the
figure
of
miss
nancy
vawse
that
presented
itself
she
came
in
briskly
and
shutting
the
door
behind
her
advanced
to
the
bedside
well
said
she
there
you
are
why
you
look
smart
enough
i
come
to
see
you
have
you
said
ellen
uneasily
miss
fortune
gone
out
and
she
told
me
to
come
and
take
care
of
you
so
i
going
to
spend
the
afternoon
are
you
said
ellen
again
yes
ai
you
glad
i
knew
you
must
be
lonely
so
i
thought
i
come
there
was
a
mischievous
twinkle
in
nancy
eyes
ellen
for
once
in
her
life
wished
for
her
aunt
presence
what
are
you
doing
nothing
said
ellen
nothing
indeed
it
a
fine
thing
to
lie
there
and
do
nothing
you
wo
get
well
in
a
hurry
i
guess
will
you
you
look
as
well
as
i
do
this
minute
oh

always
knew

was
a
sham

very
much
mistaken
said
ellen
indignantly
i
have
been
very
sick
and
i
am
not
at
all
well
yet
it
very
nice
to
think
so
i
guess

lazy
how
soft
and
good
those
pillows
do
look
to
be
sure

ellen
try
getting
up
a
little
believe

hurt
yourself
with
sleeping

you
good
to

of

pulled
ellen
arm
as
she
spoke
stop
nancy

me
alone
cried
ellen
struggling
with
all
her
force
i
must

ca

must
get
up
what

you
mean
i
not
able
to
sit
up
at
all

she
succeeded
in
freeing
herself
from
nancy
grasp
well
you
an
obstinate
piece
said
the
other
have
your
own
way
but
mind
i
left
in
charge
of
you

it
time
for
you

take
your
physic

ellen

nothing
but
gruel
and
little
things
and
little
things
little
things
means
something
good
i
well

it
time
for
you
to
take
some
gruel

of
the
little
things

nothing
people

them

nurse

i
going
to
give
it
to
you
when
i
think

me
feel
your
pulse
yes

pulse
says

shall
put
some
down
to
warm
right
away
i
sha
take
it
said
ellen
that
a
likely
story

not
say
so
i
rather
you
will
if
i
give
it
to
you
look
here
ellen
you
better
mind
how
you
behave
you
going
to
do
just
what
i
tell
you
i
know
how
to
manage
you
if
you
make
any
fuss
i
shall
just
tickle
you
finely
said
nancy
as
she
prepared
a
bed
of
coals
and
set
the
cup
of
gruel
on
it
to
get
hot
i
do
it
in
no
time
at
all
my
young
lady
so
you
better
mind
poor
ellen
involuntarily
curled
up
her
feet
under
the
bedclothes
so
as
to
get
them
as
far
as
possible
out
of
harm
way
she
judged
the
best
thing
was
to
keep
quiet
if
she
could
so
she
said
nothing
nancy
was
in
great
glee
with
something
of
the
same
spirit
of
mischief
that
a
cat
shows
when
she
has
a
captured
mouse
at
the
end
of
her
paws
while
the
gruel
was
heating
she
spun
round
the
room
in
quest
of
amusement
and
her
sudden
jerks
and
flings
from
one
place
and
thing
to
another
had
so
much
of
lawlessness
that
ellen
was
in
perpetual
terror
as
to
what
she
might
take
it
into
her
head
to
do
next
where
does
that
door
lead
to
i
believe
that
one
leads
to
the
garret
said
ellen
you
so
why
do
you
say
it
does
at
once
i
have
been
up
to
see
you
have
you
expect
me
to
believe
that
i
i
am
not
quite
such
a
gull
as
you
take
me
for
what
up
there
i
do
know
of
course
of
course
i
declare
i
do
know
what
you
are
up
to
exactly
but
if
you
wo
tell
me
i
find
out
for
myself
pretty
quick
that
one
thing
she
flung
open
the
door
and
ran
up
and
ellen
heard
her
feet
trampling
overhead
from
one
end
of
the
house
to
the
other
and
sounds
too
of
pushing
and
pulling
things
over
the
floor
it
was
plain
nancy
was
rummaging
well
said
ellen
as
she
turned
uneasily
upon
her
bed
it
no
affair
of
mine
i
ca
help
it
whatever
she
does
but
oh
wo
aunt
fortune
be
angry
nancy
presently
came
down
with
her
frock
gathered
up
into
a
bag
before
her
what
do
you
think
i
have
got
here
said
she
i
you
did
know
there
was
a
basket
of
fine
hickory
nuts
up
there
in
the
corner
was
it
you
or
miss
fortune
that
hid
them
away
so
nicely
i
she
thought
nobody
would
ever
think
of
looking
behind
the
great
blue
chest
and
under
the
feather
bed
but
it
takes
me
miss
fortune
was
afraid
of
your
stealing
i
guess
ellen
she
need
have
been
said
ellen
indignantly
no
i
suppose
you
would
take
if
you
saw
you
would
eat
if
they
were
cracked
for
you
would
you
she
flung
some
on
ellen
bed
as
she
spoke
nancy
had
seated
herself
on
the
floor
and
using
for
a
hammer
a
piece
of
old
iron
she
had
brought
down
with
her
from
the
garret
she
was
cracking
the
nuts
on
the
clean
white
hearth
indeed
i
would
said
ellen
throwing
them
back
and
you
to
crack
them
there
nancy
you
make
a
dreadful
muss
what
do
you
think
i
care
said
the
other
scornfully
she
leisurely
cracked
and
eat
as
many
as
she
pleased
of
the
nuts
bestowing
the
rest
in
the
bosom
of
her
frock
ellen
watched
fearfully
for
her
next
move
if
she
should
open
the
little
door
and
get
among
her
books
and
boxes
nancy
first
care
however
was
the
cup
of
gruel
it
was
found
too
hot
for
any
mortal
lips
to
bear
so
it
was
set
on
one
side
to
cool
then
taking
up
her
rambling
examination
of
the
room
she
went
from
window
to
window
what
fine
big
windows
one
might
get
in
here
easy
enough
i
declare
ellen
some
night
i
set
the
ladder
up
against
here
and
the
first
thing
you
see
will
be
me
coming
in
you
have
me
to
sleep
with
you
before
you
think
i
fasten
my
windows
said
ellen
no
you
wo
you
do
it
a
night
or
two
may
be
but
then
forget
it
i
shall
find
them
open
when
i
come
oh
i
come
but
i
could
call
aunt
fortune
said
ellen
no
you
could
if
you
spoke
a
word
i
tickle
you
to
death
that
what
i
do
i
know
how
to
fix
you
off
and
if
you
did
call
her
i
just
whap
out
of
the
window
and
run
off
with
my
ladder
and
then
you
get
a
fine
combing
for
disturbing
the
house
what
in
this
trunk
only
my
clothes
and
things
said
ellen
oh
goody
that
fine
now
i
have
a
look
at
that
just
what
i
wanted
only
i
did
know
it
where
the
key
oh
here
it
is
sticking
in
that
good
oh
please
do
said
ellen
raising
herself
on
her
elbows
all
in
nice
order
and
you
get
them
all
in
confusion
oh
do
let
them
alone
you
best
be
quiet
or
i
come
and
see
you
said
nancy
i
just
going
to
look
at
everything
in
it
and
if
i
find
any
thing
out
of
sorts
you
get
it
what
this
ruffles
i
declare
ai
you
fine
i
see
how
they
look
on
me
what
a
plague
you
have
a
glass
in
the
room
never
mind
i
am
used
to
dressing
without
a
glass
oh
i
wish
you
would
said
ellen
who
was
worried
to
the
last
degree
at
seeing
her
nicely
ruffles
round
nancy
neck
so
nice
and
you
muss
them
all
up
do
cry
about
it
said
nancy
coolly
i
ai
agoing
to
eat
my
goodness
what
a
fine
hood
ai
that
pretty
the
nice
blue
hood
was
turned
about
in
nancy
fingers
and
well
looked
at
inside
and
out
ellen
was
in
distress
for
fear
it
would
go
on
head
as
well
as
the
ruffles
round
her
neck
but
it
did
she
flung
it
at
length
on
one
side
and
went
on
pulling
out
one
thing
after
another
strewing
them
very
carelessly
about
the
floor
what
here
a
pair
of
dirty
stockings
as
i
am
alive
ai
you
ashamed
to
put
dirty
stockings
in
your
trunk
they
are
no
such
thing
said
ellen
who
in
her
vexation
was
in
danger
of
forgetting
her
fear
i
worn
them
but
once
they
no
business
in
here
anyhow
said
nancy
rolling
them
up
in
a
hard
ball
and
giving
them
a
sudden
fling
at
ellen
they
just
missed
her
face
and
struck
the
wall
beyond
ellen
seized
them
to
throw
back
but
her
weakness
warned
her
she
was
not
able
and
a
moment
reminded
her
of
the
folly
of
doing
anything
to
rouse
nancy
who
for
the
present
was
pretty
quiet
ellen
lay
upon
her
pillow
and
looked
on
ready
to
cry
with
vexation
all
her
piles
of
white
clothes
were
ruthlessly
hurled
out
and
tumbled
about
her
capes
tried
on
her
summer
dresses
unfolded
displayed
criticised
nancy
decided
one
was
too
short
another
very
ugly
a
third
horribly
and
when
she
had
done
with
each
it
was
cast
out
of
her
way
on
one
side
or
the
other
as
the
case
might
be
the
floor
was
littered
with
clothes
in
various
states
of
disarrangement
and
confusion
the
bottom
of
the
trunk
was
reached
at
last
and
then
nancy
suddenly
recollected
her
gruel
and
sprang
to
it
but
it
had
grown
cold
again
this
wo
do
said
nancy
as
she
put
it
on
the
coals
again
it
must
be
just
right
it
warm
soon
and
then
miss
ellen
you
agoing
to
take
it
whether
or
no
i
hope
you
wo
give
me
the
pleasure
of
pouring
it
down
meanwhile
she
opened
the
little
door
of
ellen
study
closet
and
went
in
there
though
ellen
begged
her
not
she
pulled
the
door
to
and
stayed
some
time
perfectly
quiet
not
able
to
see
or
hear
what
she
was
doing
and
fretted
beyond
measure
that
her
workbox
and
should
be
at
nancy
mercy
or
even
feel
the
touch
of
her
fingers
ellen
at
last
could
stand
it
no
longer
but
threw
herself
out
of
the
bed
weak
as
she
was
and
went
to
see
what
was
going
on
nancy
was
seated
quietly
on
the
floor
examining
with
much
seeming
interest
the
contents
of
the
workbox
trying
on
the
thimble
cutting
bits
of
thread
with
the
scissors
and
marking
the
ends
of
the
spools
with
whatever
like
pieces
of
mischief
her
restless
spirit
could
devise
but
when
ellen
opened
the
door
she
put
the
box
from
her
and
started
up
my
goodness
me
said
she
this
never
do
what
are
you
out
here
for
you
catch
your
death
with
those
dear
little
bare
feet
and
we
shall
have
the
mischief
to
pay
as
she
said
this
she
caught
up
ellen
in
her
arms
as
if
she
had
been
a
baby
and
carried
her
back
to
the
bed
where
she
laid
her
with
two
or
three
little
shakes
and
then
proceeded
to
spread
up
the
clothes
and
tuck
her
in
all
round
she
then
ran
for
the
gruel
ellen
was
in
great
question
whether
to
give
way
to
tears
or
vexation
but
with
some
difficulty
determined
upon
vexation
as
the
best
plan
nancy
prepared
the
gruel
to
her
liking
and
brought
it
to
the
bedside
but
to
get
it
swallowed
was
another
matter
nancy
was
resolved
ellen
should
take
it
ellen
had
less
strength
but
quite
as
much
obstinacy
as
her
enemy
and
she
was
equally
resolved
not
to
drink
a
drop
between
laughing
on
nancy
part
and
very
serious
anger
on
ellen
a
struggle
ensued
nancy
tried
to
force
it
down
but
ellen
shut
teeth
were
as
firm
as
a
vice
and
the
end
was
that
were
bestowed
on
the
sheet
ellen
burst
into
tears
nancy
laughed
well
i
think
said
she
you
are
one
of
the
hardest
customers
ever
i
came
across
i
should
want
to
have
the
managing
of
you
when
you
get
a
little
bigger
oh
the
way
miss
fortune
will
look
when
she
comes
in
here
will
be
a
caution
oh
what
fun
nancy
shouted
and
clapped
her
hands
come
stop
crying
said
she
what
a
baby
you
are
what
are
you
crying
for
come
stop
i
make
you
laugh
if
you
do
two
or
three
little
applications
of
nancy
fingers
made
her
words
good
but
laughing
was
mixed
with
crying
and
ellen
writhed
in
hysterics
just
then
came
a
little
knock
at
the
door
ellen
did
not
hear
it
but
it
quieted
nancy
she
stood
still
a
moment
and
then
as
the
knock
was
repeated
she
called
out
boldly
come
in
ellen
raised
her
head
to
see
who
there
might
be
and
great
was
the
surprise
of
both
and
the
joy
of
one
as
the
tall
form
and
broad
shoulders
of
van
brunt
presented
themselves
oh
van
brunt
sobbed
ellen
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
wo
you
please
send
nancy
away
what
are
you
doing
here
said
the
astonished
dutchman
look
and
see
van
brunt
said
nancy
with
a
smile
of
own
curling
you
wo
be
long
finding
out
i
guess
take
yourself
off
and
do
let
me
hear
of
your
being
caught
here
again
i
go
when
i
ready
thank
you
said
nancy
and
as
to
the
rest
i
have
been
caught
the
first
time
yet
i
do
know
what
you
mean
she
sprang
as
she
finished
her
sentence
for
van
brunt
made
a
sudden
movement
to
catch
her
then
and
there
he
was
foiled
and
then
began
a
running
chase
round
the
room
in
the
course
of
which
nancy
dodged
pushed
and
sprang
with
the
power
of
squeezing
by
impassables
and
overleaping
impossibilities
that
to
say
the
least
of
it
was
remarkable
the
room
was
too
small
for
her
and
she
was
caught
at
last
i
vow
said
van
brunt
as
he
pinioned
her
hands
i
should
like
to
see
you
play
for
once
if
i
ware
the
blind
man
how
you
see
me
if
you
was
said
nancy
scornfully
now
miss
ellen
said
van
brunt
as
he
brought
her
to
bedside
here
she
is
safe
what
shall
i
do
with
her
if
you
will
only
send
her
away
and
not
let
her
come
back
van
brunt
said
ellen
i
be
so
much
obliged
to
you
let
me
go
said
nancy
i
declare
you
are
a
real
mean
dutchman
van
brunt
he
took
both
her
hands
in
one
and
laid
the
other
lightly
over
her
ears
i
let
you
go
said
he
now
do
you
be
caught
here
again
if
you
know
what
is
good
for
yourself
he
saw
miss
nancy
out
of
the
door
and
then
came
back
to
ellen
who
was
crying
heartily
again
from
nervous
vexation
she
gone
said
he
what
has
that
wicked
thing
been
doing
miss
ellen
what
the
matter
with
you
oh
van
brunt
said
ellen
you
ca
think
how
she
has
worried
me
she
has
been
here
this
great
while
just
look
at
all
my
things
on
the
floor
and
that
is
the
half
van
brunt
gave
a
long
whistle
as
his
eye
surveyed
the
tokens
of
miss
nancy
over
and
through
which
both
she
and
himself
had
been
chasing
at
full
speed
making
the
state
of
matters
rather
worse
than
it
was
before
i
do
say
said
he
slowly
that
is
too
bad
i
fix
them
up
again
for
you
miss
ellen
if
i
knew
how
but
my
hands
are
almost
as
clumsy
as
my
feet
and
i
see
the
marks
of
them
there
it
too
bad
i
declare
i
did
know
what
i
was
going
on
never
mind
van
brunt
said
ellen
i
do
mind
what
you
have
done
a
bit
i
glad
to
see
you
she
put
out
her
little
hand
to
him
as
she
spoke
he
took
it
in
his
now
silently
but
though
he
said
and
showed
nothing
of
it
ellen
look
and
tone
of
affection
thrilled
his
heart
with
pleasure
how
do
you
do
said
he
kindly
i
am
a
great
deal
better
said
ellen
sit
down
wo
you
van
brunt
i
want
to
see
you
a
little
horses
would
have
drawn
him
away
after
that
he
sat
down
ai
you
going
to
be
up
again
some
of
these
days
said
he
oh
yes
i
hope
so
said
ellen
sighing
i
am
very
tired
of
lying
here
he
looked
round
the
room
got
up
and
mended
the
fire
then
came
and
sat
down
again
i
was
up
yesterday
for
a
minute
said
ellen
but
the
chair
tired
me
so
i
was
glad
to
get
back
to
bed
again
it
was
no
wonder
harder
and
chairs
never
were
invented
probably
van
brunt
thought
so
would
you
like
to
have
a
said
he
suddenly
as
if
a
bright
thought
had
struck
him
oh
yes
how
much
i
should
said
ellen
with
another
breath
but
there
is
such
a
thing
in
the
house
that
ever
i
saw
aye
but
there
is
in
other
houses
though
said
van
brunt
with
as
near
an
approach
to
a
smile
as
his
lips
commonly
made
we
see
ellen
smiled
more
broadly
but
do
you
give
yourself
any
trouble
for
me
said
she
trouble
indeed
said
van
brunt
i
do
know
anything
about
that
how
came
that
wicked
thing
up
here
to
plague
you
she
said
aunt
fortune
left
her
to
take
care
of
me
that
one
of
her
lies
your
aunt
gone
out
i
know
but
she
a
trifle
wiser
than
to
do
such
a
thing
as
that
she
has
plagued
you
badly
she
he
might
have
thought
so
the
colour
which
excitement
brought
into
ellen
face
had
faded
away
and
she
had
settled
herself
back
against
her
pillow
with
an
expression
of
weakness
and
weariness
that
the
strong
man
saw
and
felt
what
is
there
i
can
do
for
you
said
he
with
a
gentleness
that
seemed
almost
strange
from
such
lips
if
you
would
said
ellen
faintly
if
you
be
so
kind
as
to
read
me
a
hymn
i
should
be
so
glad
i
had
nobody
to
read
to
me
her
hand
put
the
little
book
towards
him
as
she
said
so
van
brunt
would
vastly
rather
any
one
had
asked
him
to
plough
an
acre
he
was
to
the
full
as
much
confounded
as
poor
ellen
had
once
been
at
a
request
of
his
he
hesitated
and
looked
towards
ellen
wishing
for
an
excuse
but
the
pale
little
face
that
lay
there
against
the
pillow
the
drooping
eyelids
the
meek
helpless
look
of
the
little
child
put
all
excuses
out
of
his
head
and
though
he
would
have
chosen
to
do
almost
anything
else
he
took
the
book
and
asked
her
where
she
said
anywhere
and
he
took
the
first
he
saw
poor
weak
and
worthless
though
i
am
i
have
a
rich
almighty
friend
jesus
the
saviour
is
his
name
he
freely
loves
and
without
end
oh
said
ellen
with
a
sigh
of
pleasure
and
folding
her
hands
on
her
breast
how
lovely
that
is
he
stopped
and
looked
at
her
a
moment
and
then
went
on
with
increased
gravity
he
ransomed
me
from
hell
with
blood
and
by
his
my
foes
controlled
he
found
me
far
from
god
and
brought
me
to
his
chosen
fold
fold
said
ellen
opening
her
eyes
what
is
that
it
where
sheep
are
penned
ai
it
said
van
brunt
after
a
pause
oh
yes
said
ellen
that
it
i
remember
that
like
what
he
said
am
the
good
shepherd
and
lord
is
my
shepherd
i
know
now
go
on
please
he
finished
the
hymn
without
more
interruption
looking
again
towards
ellen
he
was
surprised
to
see
several
large
tears
finding
their
way
down
her
cheeks
from
under
the
wet
eyelashes
but
she
quickly
wiped
them
away
what
do
you
read
them
things
for
said
he
if
they
make
you
feel
bad
feel
bad
said
ellen
oh
they
do
they
make
me
happy
i
love
them
dearly
i
never
read
that
one
before
you
ca
think
how
much
i
am
obliged
to
you
for
reading
it
to
me
will
you
let
me
see
where
it
is
he
gave
it
her
yes
there
his
mark
said
ellen
with
sparkling
eyes
now
van
brunt
would
you
be
so
very
good
as
to
read
it
once
more
he
obeyed
it
was
easier
this
time
she
listened
as
before
with
closed
eyes
but
the
colour
came
and
went
once
or
twice
thank
you
very
much
she
said
when
he
had
done
are
you
going
i
must
i
have
some
things
to
look
after
she
held
his
hand
still
van
brunt
do
love
hymns
i
do
know
much
about
miss
ellen
van
brunt
are
you
one
of
that
fold
what
fold
the
fold
of
christ
people
i
afeard
not
miss
ellen
said
he
soberly
after
a
minute
pause
because
said
ellen
bursting
into
tears
i
wish
you
were
very
much
she
carried
the
great
brown
hand
to
her
lips
before
she
let
it
go
he
went
without
saying
a
word
but
when
he
got
out
he
stopped
and
looked
at
a
little
tear
she
had
left
on
the
back
of
it
and
he
looked
till
one
of
his
own
fell
there
to
keep
it
company
chapter
xxi
oh
that
how
sad
a
passage
is
shakespeare
the
next
day
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
a
light
step
crossed
the
shed
and
the
great
door
opening
gently
in
walked
miss
alice
humphreys
the
room
was
all
redd
up
and
miss
fortune
and
her
mother
sat
there
at
work
one
picking
over
white
beans
at
the
table
the
other
in
her
usual
seat
by
the
fire
and
at
her
usual
employment
which
was
knitting
alice
came
forward
and
asked
the
old
lady
how
she
did
pretty
well
oh
pretty
well
she
answered
with
the
look
of
bland
her
face
almost
always
wore
and
glad
to
see
you
dear
take
a
chair
alice
did
so
quite
aware
that
the
other
person
in
the
room
was
glad
to
see
her
and
how
goes
the
world
with
you
miss
fortune
humph
it
a
queer
kind
of
world
i
think
answered
that
lady
dryly
sweeping
some
of
the
picked
beans
into
her
pan
i
get
sick
of
it
sometimes
why
what
the
matter
said
alice
pleasantly
may
i
ask
has
anything
happened
to
trouble
you
oh
no
said
the
other
somewhat
impatiently
nothing
that
any
matter
to
any
one
but
myself
it
no
use
speaking
about
it
ah
fortune
never
would
take
the
world
easy
said
the
old
woman
shaking
her
head
from
side
to
side
never
would
i
never
could
get
her
now
do
hush
mother
will
you
said
the
daughter
turning
round
upon
her
with
startling
sharpness
of
look
and
tone
take
the
world
easy
you
always
did
i
glad
i
ai
like
you
i
do
think
it
a
bad
way
after
all
said
alice
what
the
use
of
taking
it
hard
miss
fortune
the
way
one
goes
on
said
that
lady
picking
away
at
her
beans
very
fast
and
not
answering
alice
question
i
tired
of
it
toil
toil
and
drive
drive
from
morning
to
night
and
what
the
end
of
it
all
not
much
said
alice
gravely
if
our
toiling
looks
no
further
than
world
when
we
go
we
shall
carry
nothing
away
with
us
i
should
think
it
would
be
very
wearisome
to
toil
only
for
what
we
can
not
keep
nor
stay
long
to
enjoy
it
a
pity
you
war
a
minister
miss
alice
said
miss
fortune
dryly
oh
no
miss
fortune
said
alice
smiling
the
family
would
be
overstocked
my
father
is
one
and
my
brother
will
be
another
a
third
would
be
too
much
you
must
be
so
good
as
to
let
me
preach
without
taking
orders
well
i
wish
every
minister
was
as
good
a
one
as
you
make
said
miss
fortune
her
hard
face
giving
way
a
little
at
any
rate
nobody
mind
anything
you
say
miss
alice
that
would
be
unlucky
in
one
sense
said
alice
but
i
believe
i
know
what
you
mean
but
miss
fortune
no
one
would
dream
the
world
went
very
hard
with
you
i
do
know
anybody
i
think
lives
in
more
independent
comfort
and
plenty
and
has
things
more
to
her
mind
i
never
come
to
the
house
that
i
am
not
struck
with
the
fine
look
of
the
farm
and
all
that
belongs
to
it
yes
said
the
old
lady
nodding
her
head
two
or
three
times
van
brunt
is
a
good
farmer
very
good
there
no
doubt
about
that
i
wonder
what
do
said
miss
fortune
quickly
and
sharply
as
before
if
there
war
a
head
to
manage
for
him
oh
the
farm
well
enough
miss
alice
that
every
one
knows
where
his
own
shoe
pinches
i
wish
you
let
me
into
the
secret
then
miss
fortune
i
a
cobbler
by
profession
miss
fortune
was
giving
way
but
something
disagreeable
seemed
again
to
cross
her
mind
her
brow
darkened
i
say
it
a
poor
kind
of
world
and
i
sick
of
it
one
may
slave
and
slave
one
life
out
for
other
people
and
what
thanks
do
you
get
sick
of
it
there
a
little
body
upstairs
or
i
much
mistaken
who
will
give
you
very
sincere
thanks
for
every
kindness
shown
her
miss
fortune
tossed
her
head
and
brushing
the
refuse
beans
into
her
lap
she
pushed
back
her
chair
with
a
jerk
to
go
to
the
fire
with
them
much
you
know
about
her
miss
alice
thanks
indeed
i
have
seen
the
sign
of
such
a
thing
since
she
been
here
for
all
i
have
worked
and
worked
and
had
plague
enough
with
her
i
am
sure
deliver
me
from
other
people
children
say
i
after
all
miss
fortune
said
alice
soberly
it
is
not
what
we
for
people
that
makes
them
love
us
or
at
least
everything
depends
on
the
way
things
are
done
a
look
of
love
a
word
of
kindness
goes
further
towards
winning
the
heart
than
years
of
service
or
benefactions
without
them
does
she
say
i
am
unkind
to
her
asked
miss
fortune
fiercely
pardon
me
said
alice
words
on
her
part
are
unnecessary
it
is
easy
to
see
from
your
own
that
there
is
no
love
lost
between
you
and
i
am
very
sorry
it
is
so
love
indeed
said
miss
fortune
with
great
indignation
there
never
was
any
to
lose
i
can
assure
you
she
plagues
the
very
life
out
of
me
why
she
had
been
here
three
days
before
she
went
off
with
that
girl
nancy
vawse
that
i
had
told
her
never
to
go
near
and
was
gone
all
night
that
the
time
she
got
in
the
brook
and
if
you
seen
her
face
when
i
was
scolding
her
about
it
it
was
like
seven
much
you
know
about
it
i
dare
say
she
very
sweet
to
you
that
the
way
she
is
to
everybody
beside
me
they
all
think
she
too
good
to
live
and
it
just
makes
me
mad
she
told
me
herself
said
alice
of
her
behaving
ill
another
time
about
her
mother
letter
yes
that
was
another
time
i
wish
you
seen
her
i
believe
she
saw
and
felt
her
fault
in
that
case
did
she
ask
your
pardon
she
said
she
would
yes
said
miss
fortune
dryly
after
a
fashion
has
she
had
her
letter
yet
no
how
is
she
oh
she
well
enough
she
sitting
up
you
can
go
up
and
see
her
i
will
directly
said
alice
but
now
miss
fortune
i
am
going
to
ask
a
favour
of
you
will
you
do
me
a
great
pleasure
certainly
miss
alice
if
i
can
if
you
think
ellen
has
been
sufficiently
punished
for
her
if
you
do
not
think
it
right
to
withhold
her
letter
still
will
you
let
me
have
the
pleasure
of
giving
it
to
her
i
should
take
it
as
a
great
favour
to
myself
miss
fortune
made
no
kind
of
reply
to
this
but
stalked
out
of
the
room
and
in
a
few
minutes
stalked
in
again
with
the
letter
which
she
gave
to
alice
only
saying
shortly
it
came
to
me
in
a
letter
from
her
father
you
are
willing
she
should
have
it
said
alice
oh
yes
do
what
you
like
with
it
alice
now
went
softly
upstairs
she
found
ellen
door
a
little
ajar
and
looking
in
could
see
ellen
seated
in
a
between
the
door
and
the
fire
in
her
double
gown
and
with
her
in
her
hand
it
happened
that
ellen
had
spent
a
good
part
of
that
afternoon
in
crying
for
her
lost
letter
and
the
face
that
she
turned
to
the
door
on
hearing
some
slight
noise
outside
was
very
white
and
thin
indeed
and
though
it
was
placid
too
her
eye
searched
the
crack
of
the
door
with
a
keen
wistfulness
that
went
to
alice
heart
but
as
the
door
was
gently
pushed
open
and
the
eye
caught
the
figure
that
stood
behind
it
the
sudden
and
entire
change
of
expression
took
away
all
her
powers
of
speech
ellen
face
became
radiant
she
rose
from
her
chair
and
as
alice
came
silently
in
and
kneeling
down
to
be
near
her
took
her
in
her
arms
ellen
put
both
hers
round
alice
neck
and
laid
her
face
there
one
was
too
happy
and
the
other
too
touched
to
say
a
word
my
poor
child
was
alice
first
expression
no
i
ai
said
ellen
tightening
the
squeeze
of
her
arms
round
alice
neck
i
am
not
poor
at
all
now
alice
presently
rose
sat
down
in
the
and
took
ellen
in
her
lap
and
ellen
rested
her
head
on
her
bosom
as
she
had
been
wont
to
do
of
old
time
on
her
mother
i
am
too
happy
she
murmured
but
she
was
weeping
and
the
current
of
tears
seemed
to
gather
force
as
it
flowed
what
was
little
ellen
thinking
of
just
then
oh
those
times
gone
by
when
she
had
sat
just
so
her
head
pillowed
on
another
as
gentle
a
breast
kind
arms
wrapped
round
her
just
as
now
the
same
little
old
the
same
weak
helpless
feeling
the
same
committing
herself
to
the
strength
and
care
of
another
how
much
the
same
and
oh
how
much
not
the
same
and
ellen
knew
both
blessing
as
she
did
the
breast
on
which
she
leaned
and
the
arms
whose
pressure
she
felt
they
yet
reminded
her
sadly
of
those
most
loved
and
so
very
far
away
and
it
was
an
odd
mixture
of
relief
and
regret
joy
and
sorrow
gratified
and
ungratified
affection
that
opened
the
sluices
of
her
eyes
tears
poured
what
is
the
matter
my
love
said
alice
softly
i
do
know
whispered
ellen
are
you
so
glad
to
see
me
or
so
sorry
or
what
is
it
oh
glad
and
sorry
both
i
think
said
ellen
with
a
long
breath
and
sitting
up
have
you
wanted
me
so
much
my
poor
child
i
can
not
tell
you
how
much
said
ellen
her
words
cut
short
and
did
you
know
that
i
have
been
sick
too
what
did
you
think
had
become
of
me
why
vawse
was
with
me
a
whole
week
and
this
is
the
very
first
day
i
have
been
able
to
go
out
it
is
so
fine
i
was
permitted
to
ride
sharp
down
was
that
it
said
ellen
i
did
wonder
miss
alice
i
did
wonder
very
much
why
you
did
not
come
to
see
me
but
i
never
liked
to
ask
aunt
fortune
because
because
what
i
do
know
as
i
ought
to
say
what
i
was
going
to
i
had
a
feeling
she
would
be
glad
about
what
i
was
sorry
about
do
know
you
ought
to
say
said
alice
remember
you
are
to
study
english
with
me
ellen
smiled
a
glad
smile
and
you
have
had
a
weary
two
weeks
of
it
have
you
dear
oh
said
ellen
with
another
sigh
how
weary
part
of
that
time
to
be
sure
i
was
out
of
my
head
but
i
have
got
tired
lying
here
all
alone
aunt
fortune
coming
in
and
out
was
just
as
good
as
nobody
poor
child
said
alice
you
have
had
a
worse
time
than
i
i
used
to
lie
and
watch
that
crack
in
the
door
at
the
foot
of
my
bed
said
ellen
and
i
got
so
tired
of
it
i
hated
to
see
it
but
when
i
opened
my
eyes
i
could
help
looking
at
it
and
watching
all
the
little
ins
and
outs
in
the
crack
till
i
was
as
sick
of
it
as
could
be
and
that
button
too
that
fastens
the
door
and
the
little
round
mark
the
button
has
made
and
thinking
how
far
the
button
went
round
and
then
if
i
looked
towards
the
windows
i
would
go
right
to
counting
the
panes
first
up
and
down
and
then
across
and
i
did
want
to
count
them
but
i
could
help
it
and
watching
to
see
through
which
pane
the
sky
looked
brightest
oh
i
got
so
sick
of
it
all
there
was
only
the
fire
that
i
did
get
tired
of
looking
at
i
always
liked
to
lie
and
look
at
that
except
when
it
hurt
my
eyes
and
oh
how
i
wanted
to
see
you
miss
alice
you
ca
think
how
sad
i
felt
that
you
did
come
to
see
me
i
could
think
what
could
be
the
matter
i
should
have
been
with
you
dear
and
not
have
left
you
if
i
had
not
been
tied
at
home
myself
so
i
thought
and
that
made
it
seem
so
very
strange
but
oh
do
you
think
said
ellen
her
face
suddenly
brightening
do
you
think
van
brunt
came
up
to
see
me
last
night
was
it
good
of
him
he
even
sat
down
and
read
to
me
only
think
of
that
and
is
he
kind
he
asked
if
i
would
like
a
and
of
course
i
said
yes
for
these
other
chairs
are
dreadful
they
break
my
back
and
there
was
such
a
thing
as
a
in
aunt
fortune
house
she
hates
she
says
and
this
morning
the
first
thing
i
knew
in
walked
van
brunt
with
this
nice
just
get
up
and
see
how
nice
it
is
you
see
the
back
is
cushioned
and
the
elbows
as
well
as
the
seat
queer
looking
ai
it
but
it
very
comfortable
was
it
good
of
him
it
was
very
kind
i
think
but
do
you
know
ellen
i
am
going
to
have
a
quarrel
with
you
what
about
said
ellen
i
do
believe
it
anything
very
bad
for
you
look
pretty
considering
nothing
bad
said
alice
but
still
enough
to
quarrel
about
you
have
twice
said
since
i
have
been
here
oh
said
ellen
laughing
is
that
all
yes
said
alice
and
my
english
ears
do
like
it
at
all
then
they
sha
hear
it
said
ellen
kissing
her
i
do
know
what
makes
me
say
it
i
never
used
to
but
i
got
more
to
tell
you
had
more
visitors
who
do
you
think
came
to
see
me
you
never
guess
nancy
vawse
mr
van
brunt
came
in
the
very
nick
of
time
when
i
was
almost
worried
to
death
with
her
only
think
of
coming
up
here
unknown
to
everybody
and
she
stayed
an
age
and
how
she
go
on
she
cracked
nuts
on
the
hearth
she
got
every
stitch
of
my
clothes
out
of
my
trunk
and
scattered
them
over
the
floor
she
tried
to
make
me
drink
gruel
till
between
us
we
spilled
a
great
parcel
on
the
bed
and
she
had
begun
to
tickle
me
when
van
brunt
came
oh
was
i
glad
to
see
him
and
when
aunt
fortune
came
up
and
saw
it
all
she
was
as
angry
as
she
could
be
and
she
scolded
and
scolded
till
at
last
i
told
her
it
was
none
of
my
doing
i
could
help
it
at
all
and
she
need
talk
so
to
me
about
it
and
then
she
said
it
was
my
fault
the
whole
of
it
that
if
i
had
scraped
acquaintance
with
nancy
when
she
had
forbidden
me
all
this
would
never
have
happened
there
is
some
truth
in
that
is
there
ellen
perhaps
so
but
i
think
it
might
all
have
happened
whether
or
no
and
at
any
rate
it
is
a
little
hard
to
talk
so
to
me
about
it
now
when
all
over
and
ca
be
helped
oh
i
have
been
so
tired
miss
alice
aunt
fortune
has
been
in
such
a
bad
humour
what
put
her
in
a
bad
humour
why
all
this
about
nancy
in
the
first
place
and
then
i
know
she
did
like
van
brunt
bringing
the
for
me
she
could
say
much
but
i
could
see
by
her
face
and
then
van
brunt
coming
i
do
think
she
liked
that
oh
van
brunt
came
to
see
me
this
morning
and
brought
me
a
custard
how
many
people
are
kind
to
me
everywhere
i
go
i
hope
dear
ellen
you
do
forget
whose
kindness
sends
them
all
i
do
miss
alice
i
always
think
of
that
now
and
it
seems
you
think
how
pleasant
to
me
sometimes
then
i
hope
you
can
bear
unkindness
from
one
poor
woman
who
after
all
is
as
happy
as
you
are
without
feeling
any
towards
her
in
return
i
do
think
i
feel
towards
her
said
ellen
i
always
try
as
hard
as
i
can
not
to
but
i
ca
her
miss
alice
and
i
do
get
out
of
patience
it
very
easy
to
put
me
out
of
patience
i
think
it
takes
almost
nothing
sometimes
but
remember
suffereth
long
and
is
kind
and
i
try
all
the
while
dear
miss
alice
to
keep
down
my
bad
feelings
said
ellen
her
eyes
watering
as
she
spoke
i
try
and
pray
to
get
rid
of
them
and
i
hope
i
shall
i
believe
i
am
very
bad
alice
drew
her
closer
i
have
felt
very
sad
part
of
said
ellen
presently
aunt
fortune
and
my
being
so
lonely
and
my
poor
letter
altogether
but
part
of
the
time
i
felt
a
great
deal
better
i
was
learning
that
lovely
hymn
do
you
know
it
miss
alice
weak
and
worthless
though
i
am
alice
went
on
have
a
rich
almighty
friend
jesus
the
saviour
is
his
name
he
freely
loves
and
without
end
oh
dear
ellen
whoever
can
say
that
has
no
right
to
be
unhappy
no
matter
what
happens
we
have
enough
to
be
glad
of
and
then
i
was
thinking
of
those
words
in
the
psalms
is
the
man
stop
i
find
it
i
do
know
exactly
how
it
goes
is
he
whose
transgression
is
forgiven
whose
sin
is
covered
oh
yes
indeed
said
alice
it
is
a
shame
that
any
trifles
should
worry
much
those
whose
sins
are
forgiven
them
and
who
are
the
children
of
the
great
king
poor
miss
fortune
never
knew
the
sweetness
of
those
words
we
ought
to
be
sorry
for
her
and
pray
for
her
ellen
and
never
never
even
in
thought
return
evil
for
evil
it
is
not
like
christ
to
do
so
i
will
not
i
will
not
if
i
can
help
it
said
ellen
you
can
help
it
but
there
is
only
one
way
now
ellen
dear
i
have
three
pieces
of
news
for
you
that
i
think
you
will
like
one
concerns
you
another
myself
and
the
third
concerns
both
you
and
myself
which
will
you
have
first
three
pieces
of
good
news
said
ellen
with
opening
eyes
i
think
i
have
my
part
first
directing
ellen
eyes
to
her
pocket
alice
slowly
made
the
corner
of
the
letter
show
itself
ellen
colour
came
and
went
quick
as
it
was
drawn
forth
but
when
it
was
fairly
out
and
she
knew
it
again
she
flung
herself
upon
it
with
a
desperate
eagerness
alice
had
not
looked
for
she
was
startled
at
the
way
in
which
the
child
clasped
and
kissed
it
weeping
bitterly
at
the
same
time
her
transport
was
almost
hysterical
she
had
opened
the
letter
but
she
was
not
able
to
read
a
word
and
quitting
alice
arms
she
threw
herself
upon
the
bed
sobbing
in
a
mixture
of
joy
and
sorrow
that
seemed
to
take
away
her
reason
alice
looked
on
surprised
a
moment
but
only
a
moment
and
turned
away
when
ellen
was
able
to
begin
her
letter
the
reading
of
it
served
to
throw
her
back
into
fresh
fits
of
tears
many
a
word
of
montgomery
went
so
to
her
little
daughter
heart
that
its
very
inmost
cords
of
love
and
tenderness
were
wrung
it
is
true
the
letter
was
short
and
very
simple
but
it
came
from
her
mother
heart
it
was
written
by
her
mother
hand
and
the
very
handwriting
had
mighty
power
to
move
her
she
was
so
wrapped
up
in
her
own
feelings
that
through
it
all
she
never
noticed
that
alice
was
not
near
her
that
alice
did
not
speak
to
comfort
her
when
the
letter
had
been
read
time
after
time
and
wept
over
again
and
again
and
ellen
at
last
was
folding
it
up
for
the
present
she
bethought
herself
of
her
friend
and
turned
to
look
after
her
alice
was
sitting
by
the
window
her
face
hid
in
her
hands
and
as
ellen
drew
near
she
was
surprised
to
see
that
tears
were
flowing
and
her
breast
heaving
ellen
came
quite
close
and
softly
laid
her
hand
on
alice
shoulder
but
it
drew
no
attention
miss
alice
said
ellen
almost
fearfully
miss
alice
and
her
own
eyes
filled
fast
again
what
is
the
matter
wo
you
tell
me
oh
do
do
so
please
do
i
will
not
said
alice
lifting
her
head
i
am
sorry
i
have
troubled
you
dear
i
am
sorry
i
could
not
help
it
she
kissed
ellen
who
stood
anxious
and
sorrowful
by
her
side
and
brushed
away
her
tears
but
ellen
saw
she
had
been
shedding
a
great
many
what
is
the
matter
dear
miss
alice
what
has
happened
to
trouble
you
wo
you
tell
me
ellen
was
almost
crying
herself
alice
came
back
to
the
and
took
ellen
in
her
arms
again
but
she
did
not
answer
her
leaning
her
face
against
ellen
forehead
she
remained
silent
ellen
ventured
to
ask
no
more
questions
but
lifting
her
hand
once
or
twice
caressingly
to
alice
face
she
was
distressed
to
find
her
cheek
wet
still
alice
spoke
at
last
it
is
fair
not
to
tell
you
what
is
the
matter
dear
ellen
since
i
have
let
you
see
me
sorrowing
it
is
nothing
new
nor
anything
i
would
have
otherwise
if
i
could
it
is
only
that
i
have
had
a
mother
once
and
have
lost
her
and
you
brought
back
the
old
time
so
strongly
that
i
could
not
command
myself
ellen
felt
a
hot
tear
drop
upon
her
forehead
and
again
ventured
to
speak
her
sympathy
only
by
silently
stroking
alice
cheek
it
all
past
now
said
alice
it
is
all
well
i
would
not
have
her
back
again
i
shall
go
to
her
i
hope
oh
no
you
must
stay
with
me
said
ellen
clasping
both
arms
round
her
there
was
a
long
silence
during
which
they
remained
locked
in
each
other
arms
ellen
dear
said
alice
at
length
we
are
both
motherless
for
the
present
at
least
both
of
us
almost
alone
i
think
god
has
brought
us
together
to
be
a
comfort
to
each
other
we
will
be
sisters
while
he
permits
us
to
be
so
do
call
me
miss
alice
any
more
you
shall
be
my
little
sister
and
i
will
be
your
elder
sister
and
my
home
shall
be
your
home
as
well
ellen
arms
were
drawn
very
close
round
her
companion
at
this
but
she
said
nothing
and
her
face
was
laid
in
alice
bosom
there
was
another
very
long
pause
then
alice
spoke
in
a
livelier
tone
come
ellen
look
up
you
and
i
have
forgotten
ourselves
it
is
good
for
sick
people
to
get
down
in
the
dumps
look
up
and
let
me
see
these
pale
cheeks
do
you
want
something
to
eat
i
do
know
said
ellen
faintly
what
would
you
say
to
a
cup
of
chicken
broth
oh
i
should
like
it
very
much
said
ellen
with
new
energy
margery
made
me
some
particularly
nice
as
she
always
does
and
i
took
it
into
my
head
a
little
might
not
come
amiss
to
you
so
i
resolved
to
stand
the
chance
of
sharp
jolting
it
all
over
me
and
i
rode
down
with
a
little
pail
of
it
on
my
arm
let
me
rake
open
these
coals
and
you
shall
have
some
directly
and
did
you
come
without
being
spattered
said
ellen
not
a
drop
is
this
what
you
use
to
warm
things
in
never
mind
it
has
had
gruel
in
it
i
set
the
tin
pail
on
the
fire
it
wo
hurt
it
i
am
so
much
obliged
to
you
said
ellen
for
do
you
know
i
have
got
quite
tired
of
gruel
and
panada
i
ca
bear
then
i
am
very
glad
i
brought
it
while
it
was
warming
alice
washed
ellen
gruel
cup
and
spoon
and
presently
she
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
ellen
eating
the
broth
with
that
keen
enjoyment
none
know
but
those
that
have
been
sick
and
are
getting
well
she
smiled
to
see
her
gaining
strength
almost
in
the
very
act
of
swallowing
ellen
said
she
presently
i
have
been
considering
your
it
looks
rather
doleful
i
make
you
a
present
of
some
dimity
and
when
you
come
to
see
me
you
shall
make
a
cover
for
it
that
will
reach
down
to
the
floor
and
hide
those
long
legs
that
would
do
at
all
said
ellen
aunt
fortune
would
go
off
into
all
sorts
of
fits
what
about
why
the
washing
miss
alice
to
have
such
a
great
thing
to
wash
every
now
and
then

ca
think
what
a
fuss
she
makes
if
i
have
more
than
just
so
many
white
clothes
in
the
wash
every
week
that
too
bad
said
alice

bring
it
up
to
me
it
would
be
often
and
i
have
it
washed
for
you
if
you
care
enough
about
it
to
take
the
trouble

much
and

ca
aunt

going
to
say

get

to
saw
off
the
legs
and
make
it
lower
for
me
and
then
my
would
stand
so
nicely
on
the
top
maybe
i
can
yet
oh
i
never
showed
you
my
boxes
and
things
ellen
brought
them
all
out
and
displayed
their
beauties
in
the
course
of
going
over
the
she
came
to
the
secret
drawer
and
a
little
money
in
it
oh
that
puts
me
in
mind
she
said
miss
alice
this
money
is
to
be
spent
for
some
poor
child
now
i
been
thinking
that
nancy
has
behaved
so
to
me
i
should
like
to
give
her
something
to
show
her
that
i
do
feel
unkindly
about
it
what
do
you
think
would
be
a
good
thing
i
do
know
ellen
i
take
the
matter
into
consideration
do
you
think
a
bible
would
do
perhaps
that
would
do
as
well
as
anything
i
think
about
it
i
should
like
to
do
it
very
much
said
ellen
for
she
has
vexed
me
wonderfully
well
ellen
would
you
like
to
hear
my
other
pieces
of
news
or
have
you
no
curiosity
oh
yes
indeed
said
ellen
i
had
forgotten
it
entirely
what
is
it
miss
alice
you
know
i
told
you
one
concerns
only
myself
but
it
is
great
news
to
me
i
learnt
this
morning
that
my
brother
will
come
to
spend
the
holidays
with
me
it
is
many
months
since
i
have
seen
him
does
he
live
far
away
said
ellen
yes
he
has
gone
far
away
to
pursue
his
studies
and
can
not
come
home
often
the
other
piece
of
news
is
that
i
intend
if
you
have
no
objection
to
ask
miss
fortune
leave
to
have
you
spend
the
holidays
with
me
too
oh
delightful
said
ellen
starting
up
and
clapping
her
hands
and
then
throwing
them
round
her
adopted
sister
neck
dear
alice
how
good
you
are
then
i
suppose
i
may
reckon
upon
your
consent
said
alice
and
speak
to
miss
fortune
without
delay
oh
thank
you
dear
miss
alice
how
glad
i
am
i
shall
be
happy
all
the
time
from
now
till
then
thinking
of
it
you
are
going
i
must
ah
do
go
yet
sit
down
again
you
know
you
my
sister
do
you
want
to
read
mamma
letter
if
you
please
ellen
i
should
like
it
very
much
she
sat
down
and
ellen
gave
her
the
letter
and
stood
by
while
she
read
it
watching
her
with
glistening
eyes
and
though
as
she
saw
fill
her
own
overflowed
again
she
hung
over
her
still
to
the
last
going
over
every
line
this
time
with
a
new
pleasure
new
york
my
dear
ellen
i
meant
to
have
written
to
you
before
but
have
been
scarcely
able
to
do
so
i
did
make
one
or
two
efforts
which
came
to
nothing
i
was
obliged
to
give
it
up
before
finishing
anything
that
could
be
called
a
letter
i
feel
much
stronger
than
i
have
at
any
time
since
your
departure
i
have
missed
you
my
dear
child
very
much
there
is
not
an
hour
in
the
day
nor
a
that
the
want
of
you
does
not
come
home
to
my
heart
and
i
think
i
have
missed
you
in
my
very
dreams
this
separation
is
a
very
hard
thing
to
bear
but
the
hand
that
has
arranged
it
does
nothing
amiss
we
must
trust
him
my
daughter
that
all
will
be
well
i
feel
it
well
though
sometimes
the
thought
of
your
dear
little
face
is
almost
too
much
for
me
i
will
thank
god
i
have
had
such
a
blessing
so
long
and
i
now
commit
my
treasure
to
him
it
is
an
unspeakable
comfort
to
me
to
do
this
for
nothing
committed
to
his
care
is
ever
forgotten
or
neglected
oh
my
daughter
never
forget
to
pray
never
slight
it
it
is
almost
my
only
refuge
now
i
have
lost
you
and
it
bears
me
up
how
often
how
often
through
years
gone
by
when
and
faint
i
have
fallen
on
my
knees
and
presently
there
have
been
as
it
were
drops
of
cool
water
sprinkled
upon
my
spirit
fever
learn
to
love
prayer
dear
ellen
and
then
you
will
have
a
cure
for
all
the
sorrows
of
life
and
keep
this
letter
that
if
ever
you
are
like
to
forget
it
your
mother
testimony
may
come
to
mind
again
my
tea
that
used
to
be
so
pleasant
has
become
a
sad
meal
to
me
i
drink
it
mechanically
and
set
down
my
cup
remembering
only
that
the
dear
little
hand
which
used
to
minister
to
my
wants
is
near
me
no
more
my
child
my
child
words
are
poor
to
express
the
yearnings
my
spirit
is
near
you
all
the
time
your
old
gentleman
has
paid
me
several
visits
the
day
after
you
went
came
some
beautiful
pigeons
i
sent
word
back
that
you
were
no
longer
here
to
enjoy
his
gifts
and
the
next
day
he
came
to
see
me
he
has
shown
himself
very
kind
and
all
this
dear
ellen
had
for
its
immediate
cause
your
proper
and
behaviour
in
the
store
that
thought
has
been
sweeter
to
me
than
all
the
old
gentleman
birds
and
fruit
i
am
sorry
to
inform
you
that
though
i
have
seen
him
so
many
times
i
am
still
perfectly
ignorant
of
his
name
we
set
sail
monday
in
the
your
father
has
secured
a
nice
for
me
and
i
have
a
store
of
comforts
laid
up
for
the
voyage
so
next
week
you
may
imagine
me
out
on
the
broad
ocean
with
nothing
but
sky
and
clouds
and
water
to
be
seen
around
me
and
probably
much
too
sick
to
look
at
those
never
mind
that
the
sickness
is
good
for
me
i
will
write
you
as
soon
as
i
can
again
and
send
by
the
first
conveyance
and
now
my
dear
baby
my
precious
child
farewell
may
the
blessing
of
god
be
with
you
your
affectionate
mother
e
montgomery
you
ought
to
be
a
good
child
ellen
said
alice
as
she
dashed
away
some
tears
thank
you
for
letting
me
see
this
it
has
been
a
great
pleasure
to
me
and
now
said
ellen
you
feel
as
if
you
knew
mamma
a
little
enough
to
honour
and
respect
her
very
much
now
my
love
i
must
be
at
home
before
it
is
late
i
will
see
you
again
before
christmas
comes
chapter
xxii
when
icicles
hang
by
the
wall
and
dick
the
shepherd
blows
his
nail
and
tom
bears
logs
into
the
hall
and
milk
comes
frozen
home
in
pail
shakespeare
to
ellen
sorrow
she
was
pronounced
next
morning
well
enough
to
come
downstairs
her
aunt
averring
that
it
was
no
use
to
keep
a
fire
burning
up
there
for
nothing
she
must
get
up
and
dress
in
the
cold
again
and
winter
had
fairly
set
in
now
the
of
december
rose
clear
and
keen
ellen
looked
sighingly
at
the
heap
of
ashes
and
the
dead
brands
in
the
fireplace
where
the
bright
little
fire
had
blazed
so
cheerfully
the
evening
before
but
regrets
did
not
help
the
matter
and
shivering
she
began
to
dress
as
fast
as
she
could
since
her
illness
a
basin
and
pitcher
had
been
brought
into
her
room
so
the
washing
at
the
spout
was
ended
for
the
present
and
though
the
basin
had
no
place
but
a
chair
and
the
pitcher
must
stand
on
the
floor
ellen
thought
herself
too
happy
but
how
cold
it
was
the
wind
swept
past
her
windows
giving
wintry
shakes
to
the
panes
of
glass
and
through
many
an
opening
in
the
wooden
of
the
house
it
came
in
and
saluted
ellen
bare
arms
and
neck
she
hurried
to
finish
her
dressing
and
wrapping
her
over
all
went
down
to
the
kitchen
it
was
another
climate
there
a
great
fire
was
burning
that
it
quite
cheered
ellen
heart
to
look
at
and
the
air
seemed
to
be
full
of
coffee
and
buckwheat
cakes
ellen
almost
thought
she
should
get
enough
breakfast
by
the
sense
of
smell
ah
here
you
are
said
miss
fortune
what
have
you
got
that
thing
on
for
it
was
so
cold
upstairs
said
ellen
drawing
up
her
shoulders
the
warmth
had
not
got
inside
of
her
wrapper
yet
well
cold
here
you
better
pull
it
off
right
away
i
no
notion
of
people
making
themselves
tender
you
be
warm
enough
directly
breakfast
warm
you
ellen
felt
almost
inclined
to
quarrel
with
the
breakfast
that
was
offered
in
exchange
for
her
comfortable
wrapper
she
pulled
it
off
however
and
sat
down
without
saying
anything
van
brunt
put
some
cakes
on
her
plate
if
breakfast
agoing
to
warm
you
said
he
make
haste
and
get
something
down
or
drink
a
cup
of
coffee
you
as
blue
as
skim
milk
am
i
said
ellen
laughingly
i
feel
blue
but
i
ca
eat
such
a
pile
of
cakes
as
that
van
brunt
as
a
general
thing
the
meals
at
miss
fortune
were
silent
solemnities
an
occasional
consultation
or
a
few
questions
and
remarks
about
farm
affairs
being
all
that
ever
passed
the
breakfast
this
morning
was
a
singular
exception
to
the
common
rule
i
am
in
a
regular
quandary
said
the
mistress
of
the
house
when
the
meal
was
about
half
over
van
brunt
looked
up
for
an
instant
and
asked
what
about
why
how
i
am
ever
going
to
do
to
get
those
apples
and
done
if
i
go
to
doing
myself
i
shall
about
get
through
by
spring
why
do
you
make
a
bee
said
van
brunt
ai
enough
of
either
on
to
make
it
worth
while
i
ai
agoing
to
have
all
the
bother
of
a
bee
without
something
to
show
turn
both
into
one
suggested
her
counsellor
going
on
with
his
breakfast
both
yes
let
pare
apples
in
one
room
and
cut
pork
in
but
i
wonder
who
ever
heard
of
such
a
thing
before
said
miss
fortune
pausing
with
her
cup
of
coffee
half
way
to
her
lips
presently
however
it
was
carried
to
her
mouth
drunk
off
and
set
down
with
an
air
of
determination
i
do
care
said
she
if
it
never
was
heard
of
do
it
for
once
anyhow
i
not
one
of
them
to
care
what
folks
say
have
it
so
but
i
wo
have
them
to
tea
mind
you
i
rather
throw
apples
and
all
into
the
fire
at
once
i
have
but
one
plague
of
setting
tables
and
that
i
wo
have
to
tea
i
make
it
up
to
in
the
supper
though
i
take
care
to
publish
that
said
van
brunt
do
you
go
and
do
such
a
thing
said
miss
fortune
earnestly
i
shall
have
the
whole
country
on
my
hands
i
wo
have
but
just
as
many
on
as
do
what
i
want
done
that
be
as
much
as
i
can
stand
under
do
you
whisper
a
word
of
it
to
a
living
creature
i
go
round
and
ask
myself
to
come
monday
evening
monday
evening
then
i
suppose
you
like
to
have
up
the
sleigh
this
afternoon
who
acoming
i
do
know
i
asked
yet
they
every
soul
come
that

that
you
may
depend
there
one
on
that
would
miss
of
it
for
a
dollar
miss
fortune
bridled
a
little
at
the
implied
tribute
to
her
housekeeping
if
i
was
some
folks
i
would
let
people
know
i
was
in
such
a
mighty
hurry
to
get
a
good
supper
she
observed
rather
scornfully
humph
said
van
brunt
i
think
a
good
supper
ai
a
bad
thing
and
i
no
objection
to
folks
knowing
it
pshaw
i
do
mean
said
miss
fortune
i
was
thinking
of
those
lawsons
and
other
folks
if
you
agoing
to
ask
to
your
bee
you
ai
of
my
mind
well
i
am
though
replied
miss
fortune
there
a
good
many
hands
of
they
can
turn
off
a
good
lot
of
work
in
an
evening
and
they
always
take
care
to
get
me
to
bees
i
may
as
well
get
something
out
of
them
in
return
if
i
can
they
reckon
on
getting
as
much
as
they
can
out
o
if
they
come
there
no
sort
of
doubt
in
my
mind
it
my
belief
mimy
lawson
will
kill
herself
some
of
these
days
upon
green
corn
she
was
at
home
to
tea
one
day
last
summer
and
i
declare
i
thought
what
van
brunt
thought
he
left
his
hearers
to
guess
well
let
them
kill
themselves
if
they
like
said
miss
fortune
i
am
sure
i
am
willing
there
be
enough
i
ai
agoing
to
mince
matters
when
once
i
begin
now
let
me
see
there
five
of
the
lawsons
to
begin
with
i
suppose
they
all
come
bill
huff
and
jany
seven
that
bill
huff
is
as
good
natured
a
fellow
as
ever
broke
ground
remarked
van

ai
better
people
in
the
town
than
them
huffs
are
they
well
enough
said

and
the
hitchcocks
there
three
of
them
that
make
ten

ai
far
from
there
said
van

dan
dennison
a
fine
hand
at
anything
in
doors
or
out
that
more
than
you
can
say
for
his
sister
cilly
dennison
gives
herself
so
many
airs
it
altogether
too
much
for
plain
country
folks
i
should
like
to
know
what
she
thinks
herself
it
too
much
for
my
stomach
to
see
her
flourishing
that
watch
and
chain
what
the
use
of
troubling
yourself
about
other
people
notions
said
van
brunt
if
folks
want
to
take
the
road
let
have
it
that
my
way
i
am
satisfied
provided
they
do
run
me
over
way
then
i
have
you
to
know
said
miss
fortune
i
despise
it
and
your
way
neither
van
brunt
what
did
you
give
tom
larkens
a
for
he
deserved
it
if
ever
a
man
did
said
van
brunt
quite
rousing
up
he
was
treating
that
little
brother
of
in
a
way
a
boy
should
be
treated
and
i
am
glad
i
did
it
i
gave
him
notice
to
quit
before
i
laid
a
finger
on
him
he
war
doing
nothing
to
and
how
much
good
do
you
suppose
it
did
said
miss
fortune
rather
scornfully
it
did
just
the
good
i
wanted
to
do
he
has
seen
fit
to
let
little
billy
alone
ever
since
well
i
guess
i
let
the
dennisons
come
said
miss
fortune
that
makes
twelve
and
you
and
your
mother
are
fourteen
i
suppose
that
man
marshchalk
will
come
dangling
along
after
the
hitchcocks
to
be
sure
he
will
and
his
aunt
miss
janet
will
come
with
him
most
likely
well
there
no
help
for
it
said
miss
fortune
that
makes
sixteen
will
you
ask
miss
alice
not
i
she
another
of
your
proud
set
i
do
want
to
see
anybody
that
thinks
she
going
to
do
me
a
favour
by
coming
ellen
lips
opened
but
wisdom
came
in
time
to
stop
the
words
that
were
on
her
tongue
it
did
not
however
prevent
the
quick
little
turn
of
her
head
which
showed
what
she
thought
and
the
pale
cheeks
were
for
a
moment
bright
enough
she
is
and
i
do
care
who
hears
it
repeated
miss
fortune
i
suppose
she
look
as
sober
as
a
judge
too
if
she
saw
cider
on
the

said
van
brunt
looking
towards
the
little
window
that
opened
into
the
shed
and
there
indeed
was
the
face
of
miss
nancy
pressed
flat
against
the
glass
peering
into
the
room
miss
fortune
beckoned
to
her
that
is
the
most
impudent
shameless
outrageous
piece
of
what
are
you
doing
at
the
window
said
she
as
nancy
came
in
looking
at
you
miss
fortune
said
nancy
coolly

of
glass
broken

tongue

miss

and

tongue

nancy

just
as

nancy
nodded
if

good
weather
she
added
conditionally

nancy
said
miss
fortune
here
for
nancy

shutting
the
door
behind
her
as
sure
as

without
your
grandma
you

out
of
the
house
quicker
than

came
in

another
gracious
nod
and
smile
nancy
departed
well
said
van
brunt
rising
i
despatch
this
business
downstairs
and
then
i
bring
up
the
sleigh
the
pickle
ready
i
suppose
no
it
ai
said
miss
fortune
i
could
make
it
yesterday
but
it
all
in
the
kettle
and
i
told
sam
to
make
a
fire
downstairs
so
you
can
put
it
on
when
you
go
down
the
kits
are
all
ready
and
the
salt
and
everything
else
van
brunt
went
down
the
stairs
that
led
to
the
lower
kitchen
and
miss
fortune
to
make
up
for
lost
time
set
about
her
morning
work
with
even
an
uncommon
measure
of
activity
ellen
in
consideration
of
her
being
still
weak
was
not
required
to
do
anything
she
sat
and
looked
on
keeping
out
of
the
way
of
her
bustling
aunt
as
far
as
it
was
possible
but
miss
fortune
gyrations
were
of
that
character
that
no
one
could
tell
five
minutes
beforehand
what
she
might
consider
in
the
way
ellen
wished
for
her
quiet
room
again
van
brunt
voice
sounded
downstairs
in
tones
of
business
what
could
he
be
about
it
must
be
very
uncommon
business
that
kept
him
in
the
house
ellen
grew
restless
with
the
desire
to
go
and
see
and
to
change
her
aunt
company
for
his
and
no
sooner
was
miss
fortune
fairly
shut
up
in
the
buttery
at
some
secret
work
than
ellen
gently
opened
the
door
at
the
head
of
the
lower
stairs
and
looked
down
van
brunt
was
standing
at
the
bottom
and
he
looked
up
may
i
come
down
there
van
brunt
said
ellen
softly
come
down
here
to
be
sure
you
may
you
may
always
come
straight
where
i
am
without
asking
any
questions
ellen
went
down
but
before
she
reached
the
bottom
stair
she
stopped
with
almost
a
start
and
stood
fixed
with
such
a
horrified
face
that
neither
van
brunt
nor
sam
larkens
who
was
there
could
help
laughing
what
the
matter
said
the
former
they
all
dead
enough
miss
ellen
you
need
be
scared
three
enormous
hogs
which
had
been
killed
the
day
before
greeted
eyes
they
lay
in
different
parts
of
the
room
with
each
a
cob
in
his
mouth
a
fourth
lay
stretched
upon
his
back
on
the
kitchen
table
which
was
drawn
out
into
the
middle
of
the
floor
ellen
stood
fast
on
the
stair
have
they
been
killed
was
her
first
astonished
exclamation
to
which
sam
responded
with
another
burst
be
quiet
sam
larkens
said
van
brunt
yes
miss
ellen
been
killed
sure
enough
are
these
the
same
pigs
i
used
to
see
you
feeding
with
corn
van
brunt
the
identical
same
ones
replied
that
gentleman
as
laying
hold
of
the
head
of
the
one
on
the
table
and
applying
his
long
sharp
knife
with
the
other
hand
he
while
he
was
speaking
severed
it
neatly
and
quickly
from
the
trunk
and
very
fine
porkers
they
are
i
ai
ashamed
of
and
what
going
to
be
done
with
them
now
said
ellen
i
am
just
going
to
cut
them
up
and
lay
them
down
bless
my
heart
you
never
see
nothing
of
the
kind
before
did
you
no
said
ellen
what
do
you
mean
by
them
down
van
brunt
why
laying
down
in
salt
for
pork
and
hams
you
want
to
see
the
whole
operation
do
you
well
here
a
seat
for
you
you
better
fetch
that
painted
coat
o
yourn
and
wrap
round
you
for
it
ai
quite
so
warm
here
as
upstairs
but
it
getting
warmer
sam
just
you
shut
that
door
to
and
throw
on
another
log
sam
built
up
as
large
a
fire
as
could
be
made
under
a
very
large
kettle
that
hung
in
the
chimney
when
ellen
came
down
in
her
wrapper
she
was
established
close
in
the
chimney
corner
and
then
van
brunt
not
thinking
her
quite
safe
from
the
keen
currents
of
air
that
would
find
their
way
into
the
room
despatched
sam
for
an
old
buffalo
robe
that
lay
in
the
shed
this
he
himself
with
great
care
wrapped
round
her
feet
and
chair
and
all
and
secured
it
in
various
places
with
old
forks
he
declared
then
she
looked
for
all
the
world
like
an
indian
except
her
face
and
in
high
both
he
went
to
cutting
up
the
pork
and
ellen
from
out
of
her
buffalo
robe
watched
him
it
was
beautifully
done
even
ellen
could
see
that
although
she
could
not
have
known
if
it
had
been
done
ill
the
knife
guided
by
strength
and
skill
seemed
to
go
with
the
greatest
ease
and
certainty
just
where
he
wished
it
the
hams
were
beautifully
trimmed
out
the
pieces
fashioned
clean
no
ragged
cutting
and
his
knife
disposed
of
carcase
after
carcase
with
admirable
neatness
and
celerity
sam
meanwhile
arranged
the
pieces
in
different
parcels
at
his
direction
and
minded
the
kettle
in
which
a
great
boiling
and
scumming
was
going
on
ellen
was
too
much
amused
for
a
while
to
ask
any
questions
when
the
cutting
up
was
all
done
the
hams
and
shoulders
were
put
in
a
cask
by
themselves
and
van
brunt
began
to
pack
down
the
other
pieces
in
the
kits
strewing
them
with
an
abundance
of
salt
what
the
use
of
putting
all
that
salt
with
the
pork
van
brunt
said
ellen
it
would
keep
good
without
that
it
would
spoil
very
quick
will
the
salt
make
it
keep
all
the
year
round
as
sweet
as
a
nut
i
wonder
what
is
the
reason
of
that
said
ellen
will
salt
make
everything
keep
good
everything
in
the
world
if
it
only
has
enough
of
it
and
is
kept
dry
and
cool
are
you
going
to
do
the
hams
in
the
same
way
no
they
are
to
go
in
that
pickle
over
the
fire
in
this
kettle
what
is
in
it
said
ellen
you
must
ask
miss
fortune
about
that
sugar
and
salt
and
saltpetre
and
molasses
and
i
do
know
what
all
and
will
this
make
the
hams
so
different
from
the
rest
of
the
pork
no
they
got
to
be
smoked
after
they
have
laid
in
that
for
a
while
smoked
said
ellen
how
why
you
been
in
the
the
hams
has
to
be
taken
out
of
the
pickle
and
hung
up
there
and
then
we
make
a
little
fire
of
oak
chips
and
keep
it
burning
night
and
day
and
how
long
must
they
stay
in
the
smoke
oh
three
or
four
weeks
or
so
and
then
they
are
done
then
they
are
done
how
very
curious
said
ellen
then
it
the
smoke
that
gives
them
that
nice
taste
i
never
knew
smoke
was
good
for
anything
before
ellen
said
the
voice
of
miss
fortune
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
come
right
up
here
this
minute
you
catch
your
death
ellen
countenance
fell
there
no
sort
of
fear
of
that
said
van
brunt
quietly
and
miss
ellen
is
fastened
up
so
she
ca
get
loose
and
i
ca
let
her
out
just
now
the
upper
door
was
shut
again
pretty
sharply
but
that
was
the
only
audible
expression
of
opinion
with
which
miss
fortune
favoured
them
i
guess
my
leather
curtains
keep
off
the
wind
do
they
said
van
brunt
yes
indeed
they
do
said
ellen
i
do
feel
a
breath
i
am
as
warm
as
a
toast
too
warm
almost
how
nicely
you
have
fixed
me
up
van
brunt
i
thought
that
old
buffalo
had
done
its
work
he
said
but
never
say
anything
is
good
for
nothing
again
have
you
found
out
where
the
apples
are
yet

said
ellen
miss
fortune
showed
you
well
it
time
you
know
sam
take
that
little
basket
and
go
fill
it
at
the
bin
i
guess
you
know
where
they
be
for
i
believe
you
put
there
sam
went
into
the
cellar
and
presently
returned
with
the
basket
nicely
filled
he
handed
it
to
ellen
are
all
these
for
me
she
said
in
surprise
every
one
of
said
van
brunt
but
i
do
like
to
said
ellen
what
will
aunt
fortune
say
she
wo
say
a
word
said
van
brunt
and
do
you
say
a
word
neither
but
whenever
you
want
apples
just
go
to
the
bin
and
take
give
you
leave
it
right
at
the
end
of
the
far
cellar
at
the
corner
there
are
the
bins
and
all
sorts
of
apples
in
you
got
a
pretty
variety
there
you
oh

ellen
and
what
beauties

i

much
red
and
yellow
and
speckled
and
green
what
a
great
monster
that
a
swar
they
ai
as
good
as
most
of
the
others
these
are
said
ellen
what
a
funny
name
it
ought
to
be
a
mighty
good
apple
shall
seek
further
at
any
rate
what
is
this
that
as
good
an
apple
as
you
got
in
the
basket
that
a
real
orson
pippin
a
very
fine
kind
i
fetch
you
some
up
from
home
some
day
though
that
are
better
than
the
best
of
those
the
pork
was
all
packed
the
kettle
was
lifted
off
the
fire
van
brunt
was
wiping
his
hands
from
the
salt
and
now
i
suppose
i
must
go
said
ellen
with
a
little
sigh
why
must
go
said
he
so
i
suppose
i
may
as
well
let
you
out
of
your
tent
first
i
have
had
such
a
nice
time
said
ellen
i
had
got
tired
of
doing
nothing
upstairs
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
van
brunt
but
said
she
stopping
as
she
had
taken
up
her
basket
to
go
you
going
to
put
the
hams
in
the
pickle
no
said
he
laughing
it
must
wait
to
get
cold
first
but
make
a
capital
farmer
wife
there
no
mistake
ellen
blushed
and
ran
upstairs
with
her
apples
to
bestow
them
safely
in
her
closet
was
her
first
care
the
rest
of
the
morning
was
spent
in
increasing
weariness
and
listlessness
she
had
brought
down
her
little
thinking
to
amuse
herself
with
learning
a
hymn
but
it
would
not
do
eyes
and
head
both
refused
their
part
of
the
work
and
when
at
last
van
brunt
came
in
to
a
late
dinner
he
found
ellen
seated
flat
on
the
hearth
before
the
fire
her
right
arm
curled
round
upon
the
hard
wooden
bottom
of
one
of
the
chairs
and
her
head
pillowed
upon
that
fast
asleep
bless
my
soul
said
van
brunt
what
become
of
that
it
upstairs
i
suppose
you
can
go
fetch
it
if
you
a
mind
to
answered
miss
fortune
dryly
enough
he
did
so
immediately
and
ellen
barely
waked
up
to
feel
herself
lifted
from
the
floor
and
placed
in
the
friendly
van
brunt
remarking
at
the
same
time
that
it
might
be
well
enough
to
let
well
folks
lie
on
the
floor
and
sleep
on
cheers
but
cushions
war
a
bit
too
soft
for
sick
ones
among
the
cushions
ellen
went
to
sleep
again
with
a
much
better
prospect
of
rest
and
either
sleeping
or
dozing
passed
away
the
time
for
a
good
while
chapter

that
i
were

then

and

want
some
fruit

that
dresseth
me
herbert
she
was
thoroughly
roused
at
last
by
the
slamming
of
the
after
her
aunt
she
and
van
brunt
had
gone
forth
on
their
sleighing
expedition
and
ellen
waked
to
find
herself
quite
alone
she
could
not
long
have
doubted
that
her
aunt
was
away
even
if
she
had
not
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
bonnet
going
out
of
the
the
stillness
was
so
uncommon
no
such
quiet
could
be
with
miss
fortune
anywhere
about
the
premises
the
old
grandmother
must
have
been
abed
and
asleep
too
for
a
cricket
under
the
hearth
and
a
in
the
chimney
had
it
all
to
themselves
and
made
the
only
sounds
that
were
heard
the
first
singing
out
every
now
and
then
in
a
very
contented
and
cheerful
style
and
the
latter
giving
occasional
little
snaps
and
sparks
that
just
served
to
make
one
take
notice
how
very
quietly
and
steadily
it
was
burning
miss
fortune
had
left
the
room
put
up
in
the
last
extreme
of
neatness
not
a
speck
of
dust
could
be
supposed
to
lie
on
the
shining
painted
floor
the
back
of
every
chair
was
in
its
place
against
the
wall
the
very
shone
and
the
heads
of
the
large
iron
nails
in
the
floor
were
polished
to
steel
ellen
sat
a
while
listening
to
the
soothing
chirrup
of
the
cricket
and
the
pleasant
crackling
of
the
flames
it
was
a
fine
cold
winter
day
the
two
little
windows
at
the
far
end
of
the
kitchen
looked
out
upon
an
expanse
of
snow
and
the
large
lilac
bush
that
grew
close
by
the
wall
moved
lightly
by
the
wind
drew
its
icy
fingers
over
the
panes
of
glass
wintry
it
was
without
but
that
made
the
warmth
and
comfort
within
seem
all
the
more
ellen
would
have
enjoyed
it
very
much
if
she
had
had
any
one
to
talk
to
as
it
was
she
felt
rather
lonely
and
sad
she
had
begun
to
learn
a
hymn
but
it
had
set
her
off
upon
a
long
train
of
thought
and
with
her
head
resting
on
her
hand
her
fingers
pressed
into
her
cheek
the
other
hand
with
the
lying
listlessly
in
her
lap
and
eyes
staring
into
the
fire
she
was
sitting
the
very
picture
of
meditation
when
the
door
opened
and
alice
humphreys
came
in
ellen
started
up
oh
i
so
glad
to
see
you
i
all
alone
left
alone
are
you
said
alice
as
ellen
warm
lips
were
pressed
again
and
again
to
her
cold
cheeks
yes
aunt
fortune
gone
out
come
and
sit
down
here
in
the
how
cold
you
are
oh
do
you
know
she
is
going
to
have
a
great
bee
here
monday
evening
what
is
a
alice
smiled
why
said
she
when
people
here
in
the
country
have
so
much
of
any
kind
of
work
to
do
that
their
own
hands
are
not
enough
for
it
they
send
and
call
in
their
neighbours
to
help
them
that
a
bee
a
large
party
in
the
course
of
a
long
evening
can
do
a
great
deal
but
why
do
they
call
it
a
i
do
know
unless
they
mean
to
be
like
a
hive
of
bees
for
the
time
busy
as
a
bee
you
know
then
they
ought
to
call
it
a
hive
and
not
a
bee
i
should
think
aunt
fortune
is
going
to
ask
sixteen
people
i
wish
you
were
coming
how
do
you
know
but
i
am
oh
i
know
you
are
aunt
fortune
is
going
to
ask
you
you
are
sure
of
that
are
you
yes
i
wish
i
was
oh
how
she
vexed
me
this
morning
by
something
she
said
you
must
get
vexed
so
easily
my
child
do
let
every
little
untoward
thing
roughen
your
temper
but
i
could
help
it
dear
miss
alice
it
was
about
you
i
do
know
whether
i
ought
to
tell
you
but
i
do
think
you
mind
it
and
i
know
it
is
true
she
said
she
did
want
you
to
come
because
you
were
one
of
the
proud
set
and
what
did
say
nothing
i
had
it
just
on
the
end
of
my
tongue
to
say
no
such
thing
but
i
did
say
it
i
am
glad
you
were
so
wise
dear
ellen
that
is
nothing
to
be
vexed
about
if
it
were
true
indeed
you
might
be
sorry
i
trust
miss
fortune
is
mistaken
i
shall
try
and
find
some
way
to
make
her
change
her
mind
i
am
glad
you
told
me
i
am
glad
you
are
come
dear
alice
said
ellen
again
i
wish
i
could
have
you
always
and
the
long
very
close
pressure
of
her
two
arms
about
her
friend
said
as
much
there
was
a
long
pause
the
cheek
of
alice
rested
on
ellen
head
which
nestled
against
her
both
were
busily
thinking
but
neither
spoke
and
the
cricket
chirped
and
the
flames
crackled
without
being
listened
to
miss
alice
said
ellen
after
a
long
time
i
wish
you
would
talk
over
a
hymn
with
me
how
do
you
mean
my
dear
said
alice
rousing
herself
i
mean
read
it
over
and
explain
it
mamma
used
to
do
it
sometimes
i
have
been
thinking
a
great
deal
about
her
and
i
think
i
very
different
from
what
i
ought
to
be
i
wish
you
would
talk
to
me
and
make
me
better
miss
alice
alice
pressed
an
earnest
kiss
upon
the
tearful
little
face
that
was
uplifted
to
her
and
presently
said
i
am
afraid
i
shall
be
a
poor
substitute
for
your
mother
ellen
what
hymn
shall
we
take
any
one
this
one
if
you
like
mamma
likes
it
very
much
i
was
looking
it
over
charge
to
keep
i
have
a
god
to
glorify
a
soul
to
save
and
fit
it
for
the
sky
alice
read
the
first
line
and
paused
there
now
said
ellen
what
is
a
charge
do
you
know
that
i
think
i
do
but
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
try
to
tell
me
first
is
it
something
that
is
given
one
to
do
i
do
know
exactly
it
is
something
given
one
in
trust
to
be
done
or
taken
care
of
i
remember
very
well
once
when
i
was
about
your
age
my
mother
had
occasion
to
go
out
for
and
she
left
me
in
charge
of
my
little
baby
sister
she
gave
me
a
not
to
let
anything
disturb
her
while
she
was
away
and
to
keep
her
asleep
if
i
could
and
i
remember
how
i
kept
my
charge
too
i
was
not
to
take
her
out
of
the
cradle
but
i
sat
beside
her
the
whole
time
i
would
not
suffer
a
fly
to
light
on
her
little
fair
cheek
i
scarcely
took
my
eyes
from
her
i
made
john
keep
pussy
at
a
distance
and
whenever
one
of
the
little
round
dimpled
arms
was
thrown
out
upon
the
coverlet
i
carefully
drew
something
over
it
again
is
she
dead
said
ellen
timidly
her
eyes
watering
in
sympathy
with
alice
she
is
dead
my
dear
she
died
before
we
left
england
i
understand
what
a
charge
is
said
ellen
after
a
little
while
but
what
is
this
charge
the
hymn
speaks
of
what
charge
have
i
to
keep
the
hymn
goes
on
to
tell
you
the
next
line
gives
you
part
of
it
god
to
glorify
to
glorify
said
ellen
doubtfully
yes
that
is
to
honour
to
give
him
all
the
honour
that
belongs
to
him
but
can
honour
most
certainly
either
honour
or
dishonour
you
can
not
help
doing
one
i
said
ellen
again
must
not
your
behaviour
speak
either
well
or
ill
for
the
mother
who
has
brought
you
up
yes
i
know
that
very
well
when
a
child
of
god
lives
as
he
ought
to
do
people
can
not
help
having
high
and
noble
thoughts
of
that
glorious
one
whom
he
serves
and
of
that
perfect
law
he
obeys
little
as
they
may
love
the
ways
of
religion
in
their
own
secret
hearts
they
confessing
that
there
is
a
god
and
that
they
ought
to
serve
him
but
a
worldling
and
still
more
an
unfaithful
christian
just
helps
people
to
forget
there
is
such
a
being
and
makes
them
think
either
that
religion
is
a
sham
or
that
they
may
safely
go
on
despising
it
i
have
heard
it
said
ellen
that
christians
are
the
only
bible
some
people
ever
read
and
it
is
true
all
they
know
of
religion
is
what
they
get
from
the
lives
of
its
professors
and
oh
were
the
world
but
full
of
the
right
kind
of
example
the
kingdom
of
darkness
could
not
stand
shine
is
a
word
that
every
christian
ought
to
take
home
but
how
can
i
shine
asked
ellen
my
dear
ellen
in
the
faithful
patient
performance
of
every
duty
as
it
comes
to
hand
thy
hand
findeth
to
do
do
it
with
thy
might
it
is
very
little
that
can
do
said
ellen
perhaps
more
than
you
think
but
never
mind
that
all
are
not
great
stars
in
the
church
you
may
be
only
a
little
rushlight
see
you
burn
well
i
remember
said
ellen
musing
mamma
once
told
me
when
i
was
going
somewhere
that
people
would
think
strangely
of
if
i
did
behave
well
certainly
why
ellen
i
formed
an
opinion
of
her
very
soon
after
i
saw
you
did
you
said
ellen
with
a
wonderfully
brightened
face
what
was
it
was
it
good
ah
do
tell
me
i
am
not
quite
sure
of
the
wisdom
of
that
said
alice
smiling
you
might
take
home
the
praise
that
is
justly
her
right
and
not
yours
oh
no
indeed
said
ellen
i
had
rather
she
should
have
it
than
i
please
tell
me
what
you
thought
of
her
dear
alice
i
know
it
was
good
at
any
rate
well
i
will
tell
you
said
alice
at
all
risks
i
thought
your
mother
was
a
lady
from
the
honourable
notions
she
had
given
you
and
from
your
ready
obedience
to
her
which
was
evidently
the
obedience
of
love
i
judged
she
had
been
a
good
mother
in
the
true
sense
of
the
term
i
thought
she
must
be
a
refined
and
cultivated
person
from
the
manner
of
your
speech
and
behaviour
and
i
was
sure
she
was
a
christian
because
she
had
taught
you
the
truth
and
evidently
had
tried
to
lead
you
in
it
the
quivering
face
of
delight
with
which
ellen
began
to
listen
gave
way
long
before
alice
had
done
to
a
burst
of
tears
it
makes
me
so
glad
to
hear
you
say
that
she
said
the
praise
of
it
is
your
mother
you
know
ellen
i
know
it
but
you
make
me
so
glad
and
hiding
her
face
in
lap
she
fairly
sobbed
you
understand
now
do
you
how
christians
may
honour
or
dishonour
their
heavenly
father
yes
i
do
but
it
makes
me
afraid
to
think
of
it
afraid
it
ought
rather
to
make
you
glad
it
is
a
great
honour
and
happiness
for
us
to
be
permitted
to
honour
him
soul
to
save
and
fit
it
for
the
sky
yes
that
is
the
great
duty
you
owe
yourself
oh
never
forget
it
dear
ellen
and
whatever
would
hinder
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
will
it
profit
a
man
though
he
gain
the
whole
world
and
lose
his
own
soul
serve
the
present
age
my
calling
to
fulfil
what
is
present
age
said
ellen
all
the
people
who
are
living
in
the
world
at
this
time
but
dear
alice
what
can
i
do
to
the
present
age
nothing
to
the
most
part
of
them
certainly
and
yet
dear
ellen
if
your
little
rushlight
shines
well
there
is
just
so
much
the
less
darkness
in
the
world
though
perhaps
you
light
only
a
very
little
corner
every
christian
is
a
blessing
to
the
world
another
grain
of
salt
to
go
towards
sweetening
and
saving
the
mass
that
is
very
pleasant
to
think
of
said
ellen
musing
oh
if
we
were
but
full
of
love
to
our
saviour
how
pleasant
it
would
be
to
do
anything
for
him
how
many
ways
we
should
find
of
honouring
him
by
doing
good
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
some
of
the
ways
that
i
can
do
it
said
ellen
you
will
find
them
fast
enough
if
you
seek
them
ellen
no
one
is
so
poor
or
so
young
but
he
has
one
talent
at
least
to
use
for
god
i
wish
i
knew
what
mine
is
said
ellen
is
your
daily
example
as
perfect
as
it
can
be
ellen
was
silent
and
shook
her
head
christ
pleased
not
himself
and
went
about
doing
good
and
he
said
any
man
serve
me
let
him
remember
that
perhaps
your
aunt
is
unreasonable
and
unkind
see
with
how
much
patience
and
perfect
sweetness
of
temper
you
can
bear
and
forbear
see
if
you
can
not
win
her
over
by
untiring
gentleness
obedience
and
meekness
is
there
no
improvement
to
be
made
here
oh
me
yes
answered
ellen
with
a
sigh
then
your
old
grandmother
can
you
do
nothing
to
cheer
her
life
in
her
old
age
and
helplessness
ca
you
find
some
way
of
giving
her
pleasure
some
way
of
amusing
a
long
tedious
hour
now
and
then
ellen
looked
very
grave
in
her
inmost
heart
she
knew
this
was
a
duty
she
shrank
from
he
about
doing
good
keep
that
in
mind
a
kind
word
spoken
a
little
thing
done
to
smooth
the
way
of
one
or
lighten
the
load
of
another
teaching
those
who
need
teaching
entreating
those
who
are
walking
in
the
wrong
way
oh
my
child
there
is
work
enough
serve
the
present
age
my
calling
to
fulfil
o
may
it
all
my
powers
engage
to
do
my
maker
will
arm
me
with
jealous
care
as
in
thy
sight
to
live
and
oh
thy
servant
lord
prepare
a
strict
account
to
give
an
account
of
what
said
ellen
you
know
what
an
account
is
if
i
give
thomas
a
dollar
to
spend
for
me
at
i
expect
he
will
give
me
an
exact
when
he
comes
back
what
he
has
done
with
every
shilling
of
it
so
must
we
give
an
account
of
what
we
have
done
with
everything
our
lord
has
committed
to
our
care
our
hands
our
tongue
our
time
our
minds
our
influence
how
much
we
have
honoured
him
how
much
good
we
have
done
to
others
how
fast
and
how
far
we
have
grown
holy
and
fit
for
heaven
it
almost
frightens
me
to
hear
you
talk
miss
alice
not
dear
ellen
that
is
not
the
word
we
ought
to
be
mindful
to
do
nothing
we
shall
not
wish
to
remember
in
the
great
day
of
account
do
you
recollect
how
that
day
is
described
where
is
your
bible
she
opened
at
the
twentieth
chapter
of
the
revelation
i
saw
a
great
white
throne
and
him
that
sat
on
it
from
whose
face
the
earth
and
the
heaven
flew
away
and
there
was
found
no
place
for
them
i
saw
the
dead
small
and
great
stand
before
god
and
the
books
were
opened
and
another
book
was
opened
which
is
the
book
of
life
and
the
dead
were
judged
out
of
those
things
which
were
written
in
the
books
according
to
their
works
and
the
sea
gave
up
the
dead
which
were
in
it
and
death
and
hell
delivered
up
the
dead
which
were
in
them
and
they
were
judged
every
man
according
to
their
works
and
death
and
hell
were
cast
into
the
lake
of
fire
this
is
the
second
death
whosoever
was
not
found
written
in
the
book
of
life
was
cast
into
the
lake
of
fire
ellen
shivered
that
is
dreadful
she
said
it
will
be
a
dreadful
day
to
all
but
those
whose
names
are
written
in
the
lamb
book
of
life
not
dreadful
to
them
dear
ellen
but
how
shall
i
be
sure
dear
alice
that
name
is
written
there
and
i
ca
be
happy
if
i
am
not
sure
my
dear
child
said
alice
tenderly
as
ellen
anxious
face
and
glistening
eyes
were
raised
to
hers
if
you
love
jesus
christ
you
may
know
you
are
his
child
and
none
shall
pluck
you
out
of
his
hand
but
how
can
i
tell
whether
i
do
love
him
really
sometimes
i
think
i
do
and
then
again
sometimes
i
am
afraid
i
do
at
all
alice
answered
in
the
words
of
christ
that
hath
my
commandments
and
keepeth
them
he
it
is
that
loveth
me
oh
i
do
keep
his
commandments
said
ellen
the
tears
running
down
her
cheeks
none
of
us
do
but
dear
ellen
is
not
the
question
is
it
your
heart
desire
and
effort
to
keep
them
are
you
grieved
when
you
fail
there
is
the
point
you
can
not
love
christ
without
loving
to
please
him
ellen
rose
and
putting
both
arms
round
alice
neck
laid
her
head
there
as
her
manner
sometimes
was
tears
flowing
fast
i
sometimes
think
i
do
love
him
a
little
she
said
but
i
do
so
many
wrong
things
but
he
will
teach
me
to
love
him
if
i
ask
him
wo
he
dear
alice
indeed
he
will
dear
ellen
said
alice
folding
her
arms
round
her
little
adopted
sister
he
will
he
has
promised
that
remember
what
he
told
somebody
who
was
almost
in
despair
not
only
believe
alice
neck
was
wet
with
ellen
tears
and
after
they
had
ceased
to
flow
her
arms
kept
their
hold
and
her
head
its
on
shoulder
for
some
time
it
was
necessary
at
last
for
alice
to
leave
her
ellen
waited
till
the
sound
of
her
horse
footsteps
died
away
on
the
road
and
then
sinking
on
her
knees
beside
her
she
poured
forth
her
whole
heart
in
prayers
and
tears
she
confessed
many
a
fault
and
shortcoming
that
none
knew
but
herself
and
most
earnestly
besought
help
that
her
little
rushlight
might
shine
bright
prayer
was
to
little
ellen
what
it
is
to
all
that
know
it
the
satisfying
of
doubt
the
soothing
of
care
the
quieting
of
trouble
she
had
knelt
down
very
uneasy
but
she
knew
that
god
has
promised
to
be
the
hearer
of
prayer
and
she
rose
up
very
comforted
her
mind
fixing
on
those
most
sweet
words
alice
had
brought
to
her
memory
fear
not
only
believe
when
miss
fortune
returned
ellen
was
quietly
asleep
again
in
her
with
her
face
very
pale
but
calm
as
an
evening
sunbeam
well
i
declare
if
that
child
ai
sleeping
her
life
away
said
miss
fortune
she
slept
this
whole
blessed
forenoon
i
suppose
she
want
to
be
alive
and
dancing
the
whole
night
to
pay
for
it
i
can
tell
you
what
she
want
a
sight
more
said
van
brunt
who
had
followed
her
in
it
must
have
been
to
see
about
ellen
for
he
was
never
known
to
do
such
a
thing
before
or
since
i
tell
you
what
she
want
and
that
a
right
hot
supper

eat
as
nigh
as
possible

fortune
was
in
a
perpetual
bustle
the
great
oven
was
heated
no
less
than
three
several
times
on
saturday
alone
ellen
could
hear
the
breaking
of
eggs
in
the
buttery
and
the
sound
of
beating
or
whisking
for
a
long
time
together
and
then
miss
fortune
would
come
out
with
floury
hands
and
plates
of
empty
egg
shells
made
their
appearance
but
ellen
saw
no
more
whenever
the
coals
were
swept
out
of
the
oven
and
miss
fortune
had
made
sure
that
the
heat
was
just
right
for
her
purposes
ellen
was
sent
out
of
the
way
and
when
she
got
back
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
the
fast
shut
oven
door
it
was
just
the
same
when
the
dishes
in
all
their
perfection
were
to
come
out
of
the
oven
again
the
utmost
ellen
was
permitted
to
see
was
the
napkin
covering
some
stray
cake
or
pie
that
by
chance
had
to
pass
through
the
kitchen
where
she
was
as
she
could
neither
help
nor
look
on
the
day
passed
rather
wearily
she
tried
studying
a
very
little
she
found
was
enough
to
satisfy
both
mind
and
body
in
their
present
state
she
longed
to
go
out
again
and
see
how
the
snow
looked
but
a
fierce
wind
all
the
fore
part
of
the
day
made
it
unfit
for
her
towards
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
she
saw
with
joy
that
it
had
lulled
and
though
very
cold
was
so
bright
and
calm
that
she
might
venture
she
had
eagerly
opened
the
kitchen
door
to
go
up
and
get
ready
when
a
long
weary
yawn
from
her
old
grandmother
made
her
look
back
the
old
lady
had
laid
her
knitting
in
her
lap
and
bent
her
face
down
to
her
hand
which
she
was
rubbing
across
her
brow
as
if
to
clear
away
the
tired
feeling
that
had
settled
there
ellen
conscience
instantly
brought
up
alice
words
ca
you
do
something
to
pass
away
a
tedious
hour
now
and
then
the
first
feeling
was
of
vexed
regret
that
they
should
have
come
into
her
head
at
that
moment
then
conscience
said
that
was
very
selfish
there
was
a
struggle
ellen
stood
with
the
door
in
her
hand
unable
to
go
out
or
come
in
but
not
long
as
the
words
came
back
upon
her
memory
a
charge
to
keep
i
have
her
mind
was
made
up
after
one
moment
prayer
for
help
and
forgiveness
she
shut
the
door
came
back
to
the
fireplace
and
spoke
in
a
cheerful
tone
grandma
would
you
like
to
have
me
read
something
to
you
read
answered
the
old
lady
laws
a
me
do
read
nothing
deary
but
would
you
like
to
have
read
to
you
grandma
the
old
lady
in
answer
to
this
laid
down
her
knitting
folded
both
arms
round
ellen
and
kissing
her
a
great
many
times
declared
she
should
like
anything
that
came
out
of
that
sweet
little
mouth
as
soon
as
she
was
set
free
ellen
brought
her
bible
sat
down
close
beside
her
and
read
chapter
after
chapter
rewarded
even
then
by
seeing
that
though
her
grandmother
said
nothing
she
was
listening
with
fixed
attention
bending
down
over
her
knitting
as
if
in
earnest
care
to
catch
every
word
and
when
at
last
she
stopped
warned
by
certain
noises
downstairs
that
her
aunt
would
presently
be
bustling
in
the
old
lady
again
hugged
her
close
to
her
bosom
kissing
her
forehead
and
cheeks
and
lips
and
declaring
that
she
was
a
great
deal
sweeter
than
any
and
ellen
was
very
much
surprised
to
feel
her
face
wet
with
a
tear
from
her
grandmother
cheek
hastily
kissing
her
again
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
ran
out
of
the
room
her
own
tears
starting
and
her
heart
swelling
big
oh
how
much
pleasure
she
thought
i
might
have
given
my
poor
grandma
and
how
i
have
let
her
alone
all
this
while
how
wrong
i
have
been
but
it
sha
be
so
in
future
it
was
not
quite
sundown
and
ellen
thought
she
might
yet
have
two
or
three
minutes
in
the
open
air
so
she
wrapped
up
very
warm
and
went
out
to
the
ellen
heart
was
very
light
she
had
just
been
fulfilling
a
duty
that
cost
her
a
little
and
the
reward
had
already
come
and
now
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
never
seen
anything
so
perfectly
beautiful
as
the
scene
before
her
the
brilliant
snow
that
lay
in
a
thick
carpet
over
all
the
fields
and
hills
and
the
pale
streaks
of
sunlight
stretching
across
it
between
the
long
shadows
that
reached
now
from
the
barn
to
the
house
one
moment
the
light
tinted
the
fences
and
whitened
then
the
lights
and
the
shadows
vanished
together
and
it
was
all
one
cold
dazzling
white
oh
how
glorious
ellen
almost
shouted
to
herself
it
was
too
cold
to
stand
still
she
ran
to
the
to
see
the
cows
milked
there
they
were
all
her
old
friends
streaky
and
dolly
and
jane
and
sukey
and
betty
flynn
sleek
and
contented
winter
and
summer
were
all
the
same
to
them
and
van
brunt
was
very
glad
to
see
her
there
again
and
sam
larkens
and
johnny
low
looked
as
if
they
were
too
and
ellen
told
them
with
great
truth
she
was
very
glad
indeed
to
be
there
and
then
she
went
in
to
supper
with
van
brunt
and
an
amazing
appetite
that
was
saturday
sunday
passed
quietly
though
ellen
could
not
help
suspecting
it
was
not
entirely
a
day
of
rest
to
her
aunt
there
was
a
savoury
smell
of
cooking
in
the
morning
which
nothing
that
came
on
the
table
by
any
means
accounted
for
and
miss
fortune
was
scarcely
to
be
seen
the
whole
day
with
monday
morning
began
a
grand
bustle
and
ellen
was
well
enough
now
to
come
in
for
her
share
the
kitchen
parlour
hall
shed
and
lower
kitchen
must
all
be
thoroughly
swept
and
dusted
this
was
given
to
her
and
a
morning
work
pretty
near
she
found
it
then
she
had
to
rub
bright
all
the
brass
handles
of
the
doors
and
the
big
brass
andirons
in
the
parlour
and
the
brass
candlesticks
on
the
parlour
mantelpiece
when
at
last
she
got
through
and
came
to
the
fire
to
warm
herself
she
found
her
grandmother
lamenting
that
her
was
empty
and
asking
her
daughter
to
fill
it
for
her
oh
i
ca
be
bothered
to
be
running
upstairs
to
fill
snuffboxes
answered
that
lady
you
have
to
wait
i
get
it
grandma
said
ellen
if
you
tell
me
where
sit
down
and
be
quiet
said
miss
fortune
you
go
into
my
room
just
when
i
bid
you
and
not
till
then
ellen
sat
down
but
no
sooner
was
miss
fortune
hid
in
the
buttery
than
the
old
lady
beckoned
her
to
her
side
and
nodding
her
head
a
great
many
times
gave
her
the
box
saying
softly
you
can
run
up
now
she
wo
see
you
deary
it
in
a
jar
in
the
closet
now
the
time
ellen
could
not
bear
to
say
no
she
hesitated
a
minute
and
then
boldly
opened
the
buttery
door
keep
out
what
do
you
want
she
wanted
me
to
go
for
the
snuff
said
ellen
in
a
whisper
please
do
let
me
i
wo
look
at
anything
nor
touch
anything
but
just
get
the
snuff
with
an
impatient
gesture
her
aunt
snatched
the
box
from
her
hand
pushed
ellen
out
of
the
buttery
and
shut
the
door
the
old
lady
kissed
and
fondled
her
as
if
she
had
done
what
she
had
only
tried
to
do
smoothed
down
her
hair
praising
its
beauty
and
whispered
never
mind
deary
you
read
to
grandma
wo
you
it
cost
ellen
no
effort
now
with
the
beginning
of
kind
offices
to
her
poor
old
parent
kind
feeling
had
sprung
up
fast
instead
of
disliking
and
shunning
she
had
begun
to
love
her
there
was
no
dinner
for
any
one
this
day
and
van
brunt
came
to
an
early
tea
after
which
ellen
was
sent
to
dress
herself
and
van
brunt
to
get
some
pieces
of
wood
for
the
he
came
back
presently
with
an
armful
of
square
bits
of
wood
and
sitting
down
before
the
fire
began
to
whittle
the
ends
over
the
hearth
his
mother
grew
nervous
miss
fortune
bore
it
as
she
would
have
borne
it
from
no
one
else
but
vexation
was
gathering
in
her
breast
for
the
first
occasion
presently
ellen
voice
was
heard
singing
down
the
stairs
i
give
something
to
stop
that
child
pipe
said
miss
fortune
she
eternally
singing
the
same
thing
over
and
over
something
about
charge
to
keep
i
a
good
notion
to
give
her
a
charge
to
keep
this
morning
it
would
have
been
to
hold
her
tongue
that
would
have
been
a
public
loss
think
said
van
brunt
gravely
well
you
making
a
precious
litter
said
the
lady
turning
short
upon
him
never
mind
said
he
in
the
same
tone
it
nothing
but
what
the
fire
burn
up
anyhow
do
worry
yourself
about
it
just
as
ellen
came
in
so
did
nancy
by
the
other
door
what
are
you
here
for
said
miss
fortune
with
an
ireful
face
oh
come
to
see
the
folks
and
get
some
peaches
said
nancy
come
to
help
along
to
be
sure
ai
your
grandma
coming
no
she
ai
i
knew
she
would
be
of
much
use
so
i
thought
i
would
ask
her
miss
fortune
immediately
ordered
her
out
half
laughing
half
serious
nancy
tried
to
keep
her
ground
but
miss
fortune
was
in
no
mood
to
hear
parleying
she
laid
violent
hands
on
the
passive
nancy
and
between
pulling
and
pushing
at
last
got
her
out
and
shut
the
door
her
next
sudden
move
was
to
haul
off
her
mother
to
bed
ellen
looked
her
sorrow
at
this
and
van
brunt
whistled
thoughts
but
that
either
made
nothing
or
made
miss
fortune
more
determined
off
she
went
with
her
old
mother
under
her
arm
while
she
was
gone
ellen
brought
the
broom
to
sweep
up
the
hearth
but
van
brunt
would
not
let
her
no
said
he
it
more
than
you
nor
i
can
do
you
know
said
he
with
a
sly
look
we
might
sweep
up
the
shavings
into
the
wrong
corner
this
entirely
overset
ellen
gravity
and
unluckily
she
could
not
get
it
back
again
even
though
warned
by
van
brunt
that
her
aunt
was
coming
trying
only
made
it
worse
and
miss
fortune
entrance
was
but
the
signal
for
a
fresh
burst
of
hearty
merriment
what
she
was
laughing
at
was
of
course
instantly
asked
in
no
pleased
tone
of
voice
ellen
could
not
tell
and
her
silence
and
blushing
only
made
her
aunt
more
curious
come
leave
bothering
her
said
van
brunt
at
last
she
was
only
laughing
at
some
of
my
nonsense
and
she
wo
tell
on
me
will
you
swear
to
that
said
the
lady
sharply
humph
no
i
wo
swear
unless
you
will
go
before
a
magistrate
with
me
but
it
is
true
i
wonder
if
you
think
i
am
as
easy
blinded
as
all
that
comes
to
said
miss
fortune
scornfully
and
ellen
saw
that
her
aunt
displeasure
was
all
gathered
upon
her
for
the
evening
she
was
thinking
of
alice
words
and
trying
to
arm
herself
with
patience
and
gentleness
when
the
door
opened
and
in
walked
nancy
as
demurely
as
if
nobody
had
ever
seen
her
before
miss
fortune
granny
sent
me
to
tell
you
she
is
sorry
she
ca
come
she
do
think
it
would
do
for
her
to
be
out
so
late
she
a
little
touch
of
the
rheumatics
she
says
very
well
said
miss
fortune
now
clear
out
you
had
better
not
say
so
miss
fortune
i
do
as
much
for
you
as
any
two
of
the
rest
see
if
i
do
i
do
care
if
you
did
as
much
as
fifty
said
miss
fortune
impatiently
i
wo
have
you
here
so
go
or
i
give
you
something
to
help
you
along
nancy
saw
she
had
no
chance
with
miss
fortune
in
her
present
humour
and
went
quickly
out
a
little
while
after
ellen
was
standing
at
the
window
from
which
through
the
shed
window
she
had
a
view
of
the
and
there
she
saw
nancy
lingering
still
walking
round
and
round
in
a
circle
and
kicking
the
snow
with
her
feet
in
a
discontented
fashion
i
am
very
glad
she
is
going
to
be
here
thought
ellen
but
poor
thing
i
dare
say
she
is
very
much
disappointed
and
how
sorry
she
will
feel
going
back
all
that
long
long
way
home
what
if
i
should
get
her
leave
to
stay
would
it
be
a
fine
way
of
returning
good
for
evil
but
oh
dear
i
do
want
her
here
but
that
no
matter
the
next
minute
van
brunt
was
half
startled
by
ellen
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
the
softest
of
whispers
in
his
ear
he
looked
up
very
much
surprised
why
do
want
her
said
he
likewise
in
a
low
tone
no
said
ellen
but
i
know
i
should
feel
very
sorry
if
i
was
in
her
place
van
brunt
whistled
quietly
to
himself
well
said
he
you
a
piece
miss
fortune
said
he
presently
if
that
mischievous
girl
comes
in
again
i
recommend
you
to
let
her
stay
why
it
true
what
she
said
she
do
you
as
much
good
as
she
behave
herself
this
evening
i
engage
or
if
she
do
i
make
her
she
too
impudent
to
live
but
i
do
care
her
grandmother
is
another
sort
but
i
guess
she
is
gone
by
this
time
ellen
waited
only
till
her
aunt
back
was
turned
she
slipped
downstairs
and
out
at
the
kitchen
door
and
ran
up
the
slope
to
the
fence
of
the
nancy
nancy
what
said
nancy
wheeling
about
if
you
go
in
now
i
guess
aunt
fortune
will
let
you
stay
what
makes
you
think
so
said
the
other
surlily
van
brunt
was
speaking
to
her
about
it
go
in
and
see
nancy
looked
doubtfully
at
ellen
face
and
then
ran
hastily
in
more
slowly
ellen
went
back
by
the
way
she
came
when
she
reached
the
upper
kitchen
she
found
nancy
as
busy
as
possible
as
much
at
home
already
as
if
she
had
been
there
all
day
helping
to
set
the
table
in
the
hall
and
going
to
and
fro
between
that
and
the
buttery
with
an
important
face
ellen
was
not
suffered
to
help
nor
even
to
stand
and
see
what
was
doing
so
she
sat
down
in
the
corner
by
her
old
friend
van
brunt
and
with
her
head
in
her
lap
watched
by
the
firelight
the
busy
figures
that
went
back
and
forward
and
van
brunt
who
still
sat
working
at
his
bits
of
board
there
were
pleasant
thoughts
in
ellen
head
that
kept
the
dancing
blaze
company
van
brunt
once
looked
up
and
asked
her
what
she
was
smiling
at
the
smile
brightened
at
his
question
but
he
got
no
more
answer
at
last
the
supper
was
all
set
out
in
the
hall
so
that
it
could
very
easily
be
brought
into
the
parlour
when
the
time
came
the
waiter
with
the
best
cups
and
saucers
which
always
stood
covered
with
a
napkin
on
the
table
in
the
front
room
was
carried
away
the
great
pile
of
wood
in
the
parlour
fireplace
built
ever
since
morning
was
kindled
all
was
in
order
and
nothing
was
left
but
to
sweep
up
the
shavings
that
van
brunt
had
made
this
was
done
and
then
nancy
seized
hold
of
ellen
come
along
said
she
pulling
her
to
the
window
come
along
and
let
us
watch
the
folks
come
in
but
it
is
time
for
them
to
be
here
yet
said
ellen
the
fire
is
only
just
burning
they
wo
wait
for
the
fire
to
burn
i
can
tell
you
they
be
along
directly
some
of
them
i
wonder
what
miss
fortune
is
thinking
of
that
fire
had
ought
to
have
been
burning
this
long
time
ago
but
they
wo
set
to
work
till
they
all
get
here
that
one

said
ellen
the
door
opened
and
the
lady
herself
walked
in
followed
by
three
others
large
tall
women
muffled
from
head
to
foot
against
the
cold
the
quiet
kitchen
was
speedily
changed
into
a
scene
of
bustle
loud
talking
and
laughing
a
vast
deal
of
unrobing
pushing
back
and
pulling
up
chairs
on
the
hearth
and
nancy
and
ellen
running
in
and
out
of
the
room
with
countless
wrappers
cloaks
shawls
comforters
hoods
mittens
and
moccasins
what
a
precious
muss
it
will
be
to

things

said
nancy
coming
forward

the
gentlemen

care
of
their
own
things
in
the
stoop
or
must
the
young
ladies
wait
upon
them
too
room
wo
hold
everything
neither
this
speech
raised
a
general
laugh
in
the
midst
of
which
bob
carried
his
own
hat
and
cloak
into
the
shed
as
desired
before
nancy
had
done
chuckling
came
another
arrival
a
tall
lank
gentleman
with
one
of
those
faces
that
are
very
broad
at
the
eyes
and
very
narrow
across
the
chops
and
having
a
particularly
grave
and
dull
expression
he
was
welcomed
with
such
a
shout
of
mingled
laughter
greeting
and
jesting
that
the
room
was
in
a
complete
and
a
stout
elderly
lady
who
had
come
in
just
behind
him
was
suffered
to
stand
unnoticed
it
miss
janet
whispered
nancy
marshchalk
aunt
nobody
wants
to
see
her
here
she
one
of
your
pious
kind
and
that
a
kind
your
aunt
do
take
to
instantly
ellen
was
at
her
side
offering
gently
to
relieve
her
of
hood
and
cloak
and
with
a
tap
on
his
arm
drawing
van
brunt
attention
to
the
neglected
person
quite
touched
by
the
respectful
politeness
of
her
manner
the
old
lady
inquired
of
miss
fortune
as
ellen
went
off
with
a
load
of
mufflers
who
was
that
sweet
little
thing
it
a
kind
of
sweetmeats
that
is
kept
for
company
miss
janet
replied
miss
fortune
with
a
darkened
brow
she
too
good
for
everyday
use
that
a
fact
remarked
van
brunt
miss
fortune
coloured
and
tossed
her
head
and
the
company
were
for
a
moment
still
with
surprise
another
arrival
set
them
agoing
again
here
come
the
hitchcocks
ellen
said
nancy
walk
in
miss
mary
walk
in
miss
jenny
marshchalk
has
been
here
this
great
while
miss
mary
hitchcock
was
in
nothing
remarkable
miss
jenny
when
her
wrappers
were
taken
off
showed
a
neat
little
round
figure
and
a
round
face
of
very
bright
and
expression
it
fastened
eye
till
nancy
whispered
her
to
look
at
juniper
hitchcock
and
that
young
gentleman
entered
dressed
in
the
last
style
of
elegance
his
hair
was
arranged
in
a
faultless
manner
unless
perhaps
it
had
a
too
much
of
the
for
when
he
had
sat
for
a
while
before
the
fire
it
had
somewhat
the
look
of
being
excessively
wet
with
perspiration
his
boots
were
as
shiny
as
his
hair
his
waistcoat
was
of
a
startling
pattern
his
pantaloons
were
very
tightly
strapped
down
and
at
the
end
of
a
showy
hung
some
showy
seals
the
kitchen
was
now
one
buzz
of
talk
and
ellen
stood
half
smiling
to
herself
to
see
the
universal
smile
when
nancy
twitched
her
here
more
coming
cilly
dennison
i
guess
no
it
too
tall
is
it
but
ellen
flung
open
the
door
with
a
scream
and
threw
herself
into
the
arms
of
alice
and
then
led
her
in
her
face
full
of
such
extreme
joy
that
it
was
perhaps
one
reason
why
her
aunt
wore
a
very
doubtful
air
as
she
came
forward
that
could
not
stand
however
against
the
graceful
politeness
and
pleasantness
of
alice
greeting
miss
fortune
brow
smoothed
her
voice
cleared
she
told
miss
humphreys
she
was
very
welcome
and
she
meant
it
clinging
close
to
her
friend
as
she
went
from
one
to
another
ellen
was
delighted
to
see
that
every
one
echoed
the
welcome
every
face
brightened
at
meeting
hers
every
eye
softened
and
jenny
hitchcock
even
threw
her
arms
round
alice
and
kissed
her
ellen
left
now
the
window
to
nancy
and
stood
fast
by
her
adopted
sister
with
a
face
of
satisfaction
it
was
pleasant
to
see
watching
her
very
lips
as
they
moved
soon
the
door
opened
again
and
various
voices
hailed
the
as
jane
jany
and
jane
huff
she
was
a
decidedly
country
girl
but
when
she
came
near
ellen
saw
a
sober
sensible
face
and
a
look
of
thorough
which
immediately
ranked
her
next
to
jenny
hitchcock
in
her
fancy
bill
huff
followed
a
sturdy
young
man
quite
as
plain
and
hardly
so
he
was
still
more
shining
with
he
made
no
pretension
to
the
elegance
of
juniper
hitchcock
but
before
the
evening
was
over
ellen
had
a
vastly
greater
respect
for
him
last
not
least
came
the
dennisons
it
took
ellen
some
time
to
make
up
her
mind
about
them
miss
cilly
or
cecilia
was
certainly
very
elegant
indeed
her
hair
was
in
the
extremest
state
of
nicety
with
a
little
round
curl
plastered
in
front
of
each
ear
how
she
coaxed
them
to
stay
there
ellen
could
not
conceive
she
wore
a
real
watch
there
was
no
doubt
of
that
and
there
was
even
a
ring
on
one
of
her
fingers
with
two
or
three
blue
or
red
stones
in
it
her
dress
was
smart
and
so
was
her
figure
and
her
face
was
pretty
and
ellen
overheard
one
of
the
lawsons
whisper
to
jenny
hitchcock
that
there
was
a
greater
lady
in
the
land
than
cilly
dennison
her
brother
was
very
different
tall
and
athletic
and
rather
handsome
made
no
pretension
to
be
a
gentleman
he
valued
his
fine
farming
and
fine
cattle
a
great
deal
higher
than
juniper

i

an

jokes
their
sports
were
cheap
an
cheery
burns
as
the
party
were
all
gathered
it
was
time
to
set
to
work
the
fire
in
the
front
room
was
burning
up
finely
now
but
miss
fortune
had
no
idea
of
having
or
done
there
one
party
was
despatched
downstairs
into
the
lower
kitchen
the
others
made
a
circle
round
the
fire
every
one
was
furnished
with
a
sharp
knife
and
a
basket
of
apples
was
given
to
each
two
or
three
now
it
would
be
hard
to
say
whether
talking
or
working
went
on
best
not
faster
moved
the
tongues
than
the
fingers
not
smoother
went
the
knives
than
the
flow
of
talk
while
there
was
a
constant
leaping
of
quarters
of
apples
from
the
hands
that
had
prepared
them
into
the
bowls
trays
or
what
not
that
stood
on
the
hearth
to
receive
them
ellen
had
nothing
to
do
her
aunt
had
managed
it
so
though
she
would
gladly
have
shared
the
work
that
looked
so
pretty
and
pleasant
in
other
people
hands
miss
fortune
would
not
let
her
so
she
watched
the
rest
and
amused
herself
as
well
as
she
could
with
hearing
and
seeing
and
standing
between
alice
and
jenny
hitchcock
she
handed
them
the
apples
out
of
the
basket
as
fast
as
they
were
ready
for
them
it
was
a
pleasant
evening
that
laughing
and
talking
went
on
merrily
stories
were
told
anecdotes
gossip
jokes
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
and
not
one
made
himself
so
agreeable
or
had
so
much
to
do
with
the
life
and
pleasure
of
the
party
as
alice
ellen
saw
it
delighted
the
pared
apples
kept
dancing
into
the
bowls
and
trays
the
baskets
got
empty
surprisingly
fast
nancy
and
ellen
had
to
run
to
the
barrels
in
the
shed
again
and
again
for
fresh
supplies
do
they
mean
to
do
all
these
said
ellen
to
nancy
on
one
of
these
occasions
i
do
know
what
mean
i
am
sure
replied
nancy
diving
down
into
the
barrel
to
reach
the
apples
if
you
had
asked
me
what
meant
i
might
ha
given
a
guess
but
only
look
said
ellen
only
so
many
done
and
all
these
to
do
well
i
know
what
as
a
bee
means
now
if
i
never
did
before
you
know
it
better
i
can
tell
you
why
oh
wait
till

his

most
of
the
dinner

bob
most
commonly

they
fixing
for
more
downstairs
dennison
went
on
rather
dryly
no
hush
said
juniper
hitchcock
sassages
humph
said
dan
as
he
speared
up
an
apple
out
of
the
basket
on
the
point
of
his
knife
ai
that
something
like
what
you
call
killing
two
just
that
exactly
said
jenny
hitchcock
as
dan
broke
off
short
and
the
mistress
of
the
house
walked
in
ellen
she
whispered
do
you
want
to
go
downstairs
and
see
when
the
folks
are
coming
up
to
help
us
and
tell
the
doctor
he
must
be
spry
for
we
ai
agoing
to
get
through
in
a
hurry
she
added
laughing
which
is
the
doctor
the
doctor
doctor
marshchalk
do
you
know
is
he
a
doctor
said
alice
no
not
exactly
i
suppose
but
he
just
as
good
as
the
real
he
a
natural
knack
at
putting
bones
in
their
places
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
there
was
a
man
broke
his
leg
horribly
at
thirlwall
the
other
day
and
gibson
was
out
of
the
way
and
marshchalk
set
it
and
did
it
famously
they
said
so
go
ellen
and
bring
us
word
what
they
are
all
about
van
brunt
was
head
of
the
party
in
the
lower
kitchen
he
stood
at
one
end
of
the
table
cutting
with
his
huge
knife
the
hard
frozen
pork
into
very
thin
slices
which
the
rest
of
the
company
took
and
before
they
had
time
to
thaw
cut
up
into
small
dice
on
the
little
boards
van
brunt
had
prepared
as
large
a
fire
as
the
chimney
would
hold
was
built
up
and
blazing
finely
the
room
looked
as
cosy
and
bright
as
the
one
upstairs
and
the
people
as
busy
and
as
talkative
they
had
less
to
do
however
or
they
had
been
more
smart
for
they
were
drawing
to
the
end
of
their
chopping
of
which
miss
janet
declared
herself
very
glad
for
she
said
the
wind
came
sweeping
in
under
the
doors
and
freezing
her
feet
the
whole
time
and
she
was
sure
the
biggest
fire
ever
was
built
could
warm
that
room
an
opinion
in
which
van
brunt
agreed
perfectly
miss
janet
no
sooner
spied
ellen
standing
in
the
than
she
called
her
to
her
side
kissed
her
and
talked
to
her
a
long
time
and
finally
fumbling
in
her
pocket
brought
forth
an
odd
little
which
she
gave
her
for
a
keepsake
jane
huff
and
her
brother
also
took
kind
notice
of
her
and
ellen
began
to
think
the
world
was
full
of
nice
people
about
eight
the
choppers
went
up
and
joined
the
company
who
were
paring
apples
the
circle
was
a
very
large
one
now
and
the
buzz
of
tongues
grew
quite
furious
what
are
you
smiling
at
asked
alice
of
ellen
who
stood
at
her
elbow
oh
i
do
know
said
ellen
smiling
more
broadly
and
presently
added
they
all
so
kind
to
me
who
oh
everybody
miss
jenny
and
miss
jane
huff
and
miss
janet
and
van
brunt
and
huff
they
all
speak
so
kindly
and
look
so
kindly
at
me
but
it
very
funny
what
a
notion
people
have
for
kissing
i
wish
they
had
i
run
away
from
three
kisses
already
and
i
so
afraid
somebody
else
will
try
next
you
do
seem
very
bitterly
displeased
said
alice
smiling
i
am
though
i
ca
bear
it
said
ellen
laughing
and
blushing
there
dennison
caught
me
in
the
first
place
and
tried
to
kiss
me
but
i
tried
so
hard
to
get
away
i
believe
he
saw
i
was
really
in
good
earnest
and
let
me
go
and
just
now
only
think
of
it
while
i
was
standing
talking
to
miss
jane
huff
downstairs
her
brother
caught
me
and
kissed
me
before
i
knew
what
he
was
going
to
do
i
declare
it
too
bad
said
ellen
rubbing
her
cheek
very
hard
as
if
she
would
rub
off
the
affront
you
must
let
it
pass
my
dear
it
is
one
way
of
expressing
kindness
they
feel
kindly
towards
you
or
they
would
not
do
it
then
i
wish
they
would
feel
quite
so
kindly
said
ellen
all
hark
what
was
that
what
is
that
said
somebody
else
and
instantly
there
was
silence
broken
again
after
a
minute
or
two
by
the
faint
blast
of
a
horn
it
old
father
swaim
i
reckon
said
van
brunt
i
go
fetch
him
in
oh
yes
bring
him
in
bring
him
in
was
heard
on
all
sides
that
horn
makes
me
think
of
what
happened
to
me
once
said
jenny
hitchcock
to
ellen
i
was
a
little
girl
at
school
not
so
big
as
you
are
and
one
afternoon
when
we
were
all
as
still
as
mice
and
studying
away
we
heard
father
swaim
horn
what
does
he
blow
it
for
said
ellen
as
jenny
stooped
for
her
knife
which
she
had
let
fall
oh
to
let
people
know
he
there
you
know
did
you
never
see
father
swaim
no
la
he
the
funniest
old
fellow
he
goes
round
and
round
the
country
carrying
the
newspapers
and
we
get
him
to
bring
us
our
letters
from
the
when
there
are
any
he
carries
in
a
pair
of
hanging
across
that
old
white
horse
of
his
i
do
think
that
horse
will
ever
grow
old
no
more
than
his
master
and
in
summer
he
has
a
stick
so
long
with
a
horse
tail
tied
to
the
end
of
it
to
brush
away
the
flies
for
the
poor
horse
has
had
tail
cut
off
pretty
short
i
wonder
if
it
is
the
very
same
said
jenny
laughing
heartily
father
swaim
thought
he
could
manage
it
best
i
guess
but
what
was
it
that
happened
to
you
that
time
at
school
said
ellen
why
when
we
heard
the
horn
blow
our
master
the
schoolmaster
you
know
went
out
to
get
a
paper
and
i
was
tired
with
sitting
still
so
i
jumped
up
and
ran
across
the
room
and
then
back
again
and
over
and
back
again
five
or
six
times
and
when
he
came
in
one
of
the
girls
up
and
told
of
it
it
was
fanny
lawson
said
jenny
in
a
whisper
to
alice
and
i
think
she
ai
much
different
now
from
what
she
was
then
i
can
hear
her
now
starks
jenny
hitchcock
been
running
all
round
the
room
well
what
do
you
think
he
did
to
me
he
took
hold
of
my
two
hands
and
swung
me
round
and
round
by
the
arms
till
i
did
know
which
was
head
and
which
was
feet
what
a
queer
schoolmaster
said
ellen
queer
enough
you
may
say
that
his
name
was
starks
the
boys
used
to
call
him
starksification
we
did
hate
him
that
a
fact
i
tell
you
what
he
did
to
a
black
boy
of
ours
you
know
our
black
sam
alice
i
forget
what
he
had
been
doing
but
starks
took
him
so
by
the
rims
of
the
ears
and
danced
him
up
and
down
upon
the
floor
but
did
that
hurt
him
hurt
him
i
guess
it
did
he
meant
it
should
he
tied
me
under
the
table
once
sometimes
when
he
wanted
to
punish
two
boys
at
a
time
he
would
set
them
to
spit
in
each
other
faces
oh
do
tell
me
about
him
cried
ellen
with
a
face
of
horror
i
do
like
to
hear
it
jenny
laughed
and
just
then
the
door
opened
and
van
brunt
and
the
old
came
in
he
was
a
venerable
old
man
with
thin
hair
as
white
as
snow
he
wore
a
long
coat
and
a
hat
the
sides
of
which
were
oddly
looped
up
to
the
crown
with
twine
his
tin
horn
or
trumpet
was
in
his
hand
his
were
on
van
arm
as
soon
as
she
saw
him
ellen
was
fevered
with
the
notion
that
perhaps
he
had
something
for
her
and
she
forgot
everything
else
it
would
seem
that
the
rest
of
the
company
had
the
same
hope
for
they
crowded
round
him
shouting
out
welcomes
and
questions
and
inquiries
for
letters
all
in
a
breath
softly
softly
said
the
old
man
sitting
down
slowly
not
all
at
once
i
ca
attend
to
you
all
at
once
one
at
a
time
one
at
a
time
do
attend
to
at
all
till
you
ready
said
miss
fortune
let
wait
and
she
handed
him
a
glass
of
cider
he
drank
it
off
at
a
breath
smacking
his
lips
as
he
gave
back
the
glass
to
her
hand
and
exclaiming
that
prime
then
taking
up
his
from
the
floor
he
began
slowly
to
undo
the
fastenings
you
are
going
to
our
house
ai
you
father
swaim
said
jenny
that
where

the
old
man

of
that
letter

a
blue
seal
to
it
ah
young
folks
young
folks
jenny
received
her
letter
amidst
a
great
deal
of
laughing
and
joking
and
seemed
herself
quite
as
much
amused
as
anybody
lawson
there
for
your
father
miss
mimy
that
saves
me
a
long
tramp
if
you
cents
in
your
pocket

of
you

squire

think

younger

seen
a
good
many
years
more
than
squire
dennison
i
must
surely
fortune
emerson
for
you
a
double
letter
ellen
with
a
beating
heart
had
pressed
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
old
man
till
she
stood
close
by
his
right
hand
and
could
see
every
letter
as
he
handed
it
out
a
spot
of
deepening
red
was
on
each
cheek
as
her
eye
eagerly
scanned
letter
after
letter
it
spread
to
a
sudden
flush
when
the
last
name
was
read
alice
watched
in
some
anxiety
her
keen
look
as
it
followed
the
letter
from
the
old
man
hand
to
her
aunt
and
thence
to
the
pocket
where
miss
fortune
coolly
bestowed
it
ellen
could
not
stand
this
she
sprang
forward
across
the
circle
aunt
fortune
there
a
letter
inside
of
that
for
me
wo
you
give
it
to
me
wo
you
give
it
to
me
she
repeated
trembling
her
aunt
did
not
notice
her
by
so
much
as
a
look
she
turned
away
and
began
talking
to
some
one
else
the
red
had
left
ellen
face
when
alice
could
see
it
again
it
was
livid
and
spotted
from
stifled
passion
she
stood
in
a
kind
of
maze
but
as
her
eyes
caught
alice
anxious
and
sorrowful
look
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
as
quick
as
possible
made
her
escape
out
of
the
room
for
some
minutes
alice
heard
none
of
the
hubbub
around
her
then
came
a
knock
at
the
door
and
the
voice
of
thomas
grimes
saying
to
van
brunt
that
miss
humphreys
horse
was
there
swaim
said
alice
rising
i
do
like
to
leave
you
with
these
gay
friends
of
ours
you
stand
no
chance
of
rest
with
them
will
you
ride
home
with
me
many
of
the
party
began
to
beg
alice
would
stay
to
supper
but
she
said
her
father
would
be
uneasy
the
old
concluded
to
go
with
her
for
he
said
there
was
a
pint
he
wanted
to
mention
to
parson
humphreys
that
he
had
forgotten
to
bring
when
they
were
talking
on
that
subject
two
months
ago
so
nancy
brought
her
things
from
the
next
room
and
helped
her
on
with
them
and
looked
pleased
as
well
she
might
at
the
smile
and
kind
words
with
which
she
was
rewarded
alice
lingered
at
her
hoping
to
see
ellen
but
it
was
not
till
the
last
moment
that
ellen
came
in
she
did
not
say
a
word
but
the
two
little
arms
were
put
around
alice
neck
and
held
her
with
a
long
close
earnestness
which
did
not
pass
from
her
mind
all
the
evening
afterward
when
she
was
gone
the
company
sat
down
again
to
business
and
went
on
more
steadily
than
ever
for
a
while
till
the
bottom
of
the
barrels
was
seen
and
the
last
basketful
of
apples
was
duly
emptied
then
there
was
a
general
shout
the
kitchen
was
quickly
cleared
and
everybody
face
brightened
as
much
as
to
say
now
for
fun
while
ellen
and
nancy
and
miss
fortune
and
van
brunt
were
running
all
ways
with
trays
pans
baskets
knives
and
buckets
the
fun
began
by
juniper
hitchcock
whistling
in
his
dog
and
setting
him
to
do
various
feats
for
the
amusement
of
the
company
there
followed
such
a
rushing
leaping
barking
laughing
and
scolding
on
the
part
of
the
dog
and
his
admirers
that
the
room
was
in
an
uproar
he
jumped
over
a
stick
he
got
into
a
chair
and
sat
up
on
two
legs
he
kissed
the
hands
he
suffered
an
to
be
laid
across
his
nose
then
threw
it
up
with
a
jerk
and
caught
it
in
his
mouth
nothing
very
remarkable
certainly
but
as
miss
fortune
observed
to
somebody
if
he
had
been
the
learned
pig
there
could
ha
been
more
fuss
made
over
him
ellen
stood
looking
on
smiling
partly
at
the
dog
and
his
master
and
partly
at
the
antics
of
the
company
presently
van
brunt
bending
down
to
her
said
what
is
the
matter
with
your
eyes
nothing
said
ellen
starting
at
least
nothing
that
any
matter
i
meant
come
here
said
he
drawing
her
on
one
side
tell
me
all
about
it
what
is
the
matter
never
mind
please
do
ask
me
van
brunt
i
ought
not
to
tell
you
it
is
any
matter
but
her
eyes
were
full
again
and
he
still
held
her
fast
doubtfully
tell
you
about
it
van
brunt
said
nancy
as
she
came
past
them
you
let
her
go
and
i
tell
you
and
ellen
tried
in
vain
afterwards
to
make
her
promise
she
would
not
come
june
said
miss
jenny
we
have
got
enough
of
you
and
jumper
turn
him
out
we
are
going
to
have
the
cat
now
come
puss
puss
in
the
corner
go
off
in
room
will
you
everybody
that
do
want
to
play
puss
puss
now
the
fun
began
in
good
earnest
and
few
minutes
had
passed
before
ellen
was
laughing
with
all
her
heart
as
if
she
never
had
had
anything
to
cry
for
in
her
life
after
puss
puss
in
the
corner
came
and
this
was
played
with
great
spirit
the
two
most
distinguished
being
nancy
and
dan
dennison
though
miss
fortune
played
admirably
well
ellen
had
seen
nancy
play
before
but
she
forgot
her
own
part
of
the
game
in
sheer
amazement
at
the
way
dennison
managed
his
long
body
which
seemed
to
go
where
there
was
no
room
for
it
and
vanish
into
air
just
when
the
grasp
of
some
grasping
blind
man
was
ready
to
fasten
upon
him
and
when
was
blinded
he
seemed
to
know
by
instinct
where
the
walls
were
and
keeping
clear
of
them
he
would
swoop
like
a
hawk
from
one
end
of
the
room
to
the
other
pouncing
upon
the
unlucky
people
who
could
by
no
means
get
out
of
the
way
fast
enough
when
this
had
lasted
a
while
there
was
a
general
call
for
the
fox
and
the
goose
and
miss
fortune
was
pitched
upon
for
the
latter
she
having
in
the
other
game
showed
herself
capable
of
good
generalship
but
who
for
the
fox
van
brunt
not
i
said
van
brunt
there
ai
nothing
of
the
fox
about
me
miss
fortune
would
beat
me
all
hollow
who
then
farmer
said
bill
huff
come
who
is
the
fox
will
i
do
not
you
bill
the
goose
be
too
much
for
you
there
was
a
general
shout
and
cries
of
who
then
who
then
dan
dennison
said
van
brunt
now
look
out
for
a
sharp
fight
amidst
a
great
deal
of
laughing
and
confusion
the
line
was
formed
each
person
taking
hold
of
a
handkerchief
or
band
passed
round
the
waist
of
the
person
before
him
except
when
the
women
held
by
each
skirts
they
were
ranged
according
to
height
the
tallest
being
next
their
leader
the
goose
van
brunt
and
the
elder
ladies
and
two
or
three
more
chose
to
be
and
took
post
outside
the
door
dennison
began
by
taking
off
his
coat
to
give
himself
more
freedom
in
his
movements
for
his
business
was
to
catch
the
train
of
the
goose
one
by
one
as
each
in
turn
became
the
hindmost
while
object
was
to
baffle
him
and
keep
her
family
together
meeting
him
with
outspread
arms
at
every
rush
he
made
to
seize
one
of
her
brood
while
the
long
train
behind
her
following
her
quick
movements
and
swaying
from
side
to
side
to
get
out
of
the
reach
of
the
furious
fox
was
sometimes
in
the
shape
of
the
letter
c
and
sometimes
in
that
of
the
letter
s
and
sometimes
looked
like
a
long
snake
with
a
curling
tail
loud
was
the
laughter
shrill
the
shrieks
as
the
fox
drove
them
hither
and
thither
and
seemed
to
be
in
all
parts
of
the
room
at
once
he
was
a
cunning
fox
that
as
well
as
a
bold
one
sometimes
when
they
thought
him
quite
safe
held
at
bay
by
the
goose
he
dived
under
or
leaped
over
her
outstretched
arms
and
snatched
hold
of
little
ellen
who
being
the
least
was
the
last
one
of
the
party
but
ellen
played
very
well
and
just
escaped
him
two
or
three
times
till
he
declared
she
gave
him
so
much
trouble
that
when
he
caught
her
he
would
kiss
her
the
worst
kind
ellen
played
none
the
worse
for
that
however
she
was
caught
at
last
and
kissed
too
there
was
no
help
for
it
so
she
bore
it
as
well
as
she
could
then
she
watched
and
laughed
till
the
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
to
see
how
the
fox
and
the
goose
dodged
each
other
what
tricks
were
played
and
how
the
long
train
pulled
each
other
about
at
length
nancy
was
caught
and
then
jenny
hitchcock
and
then
cecilia
dennison
and
then
jane
huff
and
so
on
till
at
last
the
fox
and
the
goose
had
a
long
struggle
for
mimy
lawson
which
would
never
have
come
to
an
end
if
mimy
had
not
gone
over
to
the
enemy
there
was
a
general
pause
the
hot
and
tired
company
were
seated
round
the
room
panting
and
fanning
themselves
with
their
and
speaking
in
broken
sentences
glad
to
rest
even
from
laughing
miss
fortune
had
thrown
herself
down
on
a
seat
close
by
ellen
when
nancy
came
up
and
softly
asked
is
it
time
to
beat
the
eggs
now
miss
fortune
nodded
and
then
drew
her
close
to
receive
a
long
whisper
in
her
ear
at
the
end
of
which
nancy
ran
off
is
there
anything
can
do
aunt
fortune
said
ellen
so
gently
and
timidly
that
it
ought
to
have
won
a
kind
answer
yes
said
her
aunt
you
may
go
and
put
yourself
to
bed
it
high
time
long
ago
and
looking
round
as
she
moved
off
she
added
go
with
a
little
nod
that
as
much
as
said
i
am
in
earnest
ellen
heart
throbbed
she
stood
doubtful
one
word
to
van
brunt
and
she
need
not
go
that
she
knew
but
as
surely
too
that
word
would
make
trouble
and
do
harm
and
then
she
remembered
a
charge
to
keep
i
have
she
turned
quick
and
quitted
the
room
ellen
sat
down
on
the
first
stair
she
came
to
for
her
bosom
was
heaving
up
and
down
and
she
was
determined
not
to
cry
the
sounds
of
talking
and
laughing
came
to
her
ear
from
the
parlour
and
there
at
her
side
stood
the
supper
for
a
few
minutes
it
was
hard
work
to
keep
her
resolve
the
thick
breath
came
and
went
very
fast
through
the
fanlights
of
the
hall
door
opposite
to
which
she
was
sitting
the
bright
moonlight
streamed
in
and
presently
as
ellen
quieted
it
seemed
to
her
fancy
like
a
gentle
messenger
from
its
maker
bidding
his
child
remember
him
and
then
came
up
some
words
in
her
memory
that
her
mother
lips
had
fastened
there
long
ago
i
love
them
that
love
me
and
they
that
seek
me
early
shall
find
me
she
remembered
her
mother
had
told
her
it
is
jesus
who
says
this
her
lost
pleasure
was
forgotten
and
yet
as
she
sat
gazing
into
the
moonlight
ellen
eyes
were
gathering
tears
very
fast
well
i
seeking
him
she
thought
can
it
be
that
he
loves
me
oh
i
so
glad
and
they
were
glad
tears
that
little
ellen
wiped
away
as
she
went
upstairs
for
it
was
too
cold
to
sit
there
long
if
the
moon
was
ever
so
bright
she
had
her
hand
on
the
latch
of
the
door
when
her
grandmother
called
out
from
the
other
room
to
know
who
was
there
it
i
grandma
ai
somebody
there
come
in
here
who
is
it
it
i
grandma
said
ellen
coming
to
the
door
come
in
here

said
the
old
woman
in
a
lower
tone
what
is
it
all
what
the
matter
who
downstairs

a
bee
grandma
there

while

company

all
crowded
round
the
table

and

and
helping
themselves
and
ham
and
bread
and
butter

and
mince
pies
and
apple

in
everybody
hands
one
dish
in
the
middle
of
the
big
table
had
won
the
praise
of
every
tongue
nobody
could
guess
and
many
asked
how
it
was
made
but
miss
fortune
kept
a
satisfied
silence
pleased
to
see
the
constant
stream
of
comers
to
the
big
dish
till
it
was
near
empty
just
then
van
brunt
seeing
ellen
had
nothing
gathered
up
all
that
was
left
and
gave
it
to
her
it
was
sweet
and
cold
and
rich
ellen
told
her
mother
afterwards
it
was
the
best
thing
she
had
ever
tasted
except
the
she
once
gave
her
in
new
york
she
had
taken
however
but
one
spoonful
when
her
eye
fell
upon
nancy
standing
back
of
all
the
company
and
forgotten
nancy
had
been
upon
her
good
behaviour
all
the
evening
and
it
was
a
singular
proof
of
this
that
she
had
not
pushed
in
and
helped
herself
among
the
first
ellen
eye
went
once
or
twice
from
her
plate
to
nancy
and
then
she
crossed
over
and
offered
it
to
her
it
was
eagerly
taken
and
a
little
disappointed
ellen
stepped
back
again
but
she
soon
forgot
the
disappointment
she
know
now
that
i
do
bear
her
any
grudge
she
thought
you
got
nothing
said
nancy
coming
up

they
were
ready
cloaked
and
shawled
and
ellen
was
still
hunting
for
miss
janet
things
in
the
moonlit
hall
when
she
heard
nancy
close
by
in
a
lower
tone
than
common
say
ellen
will
you
kiss
me
ellen
dropped
her
armful
of
things
and
taking
nancy
hands
gave
her
truly
the
kiss
of
peace
when
she
went
up
to
undress
for
the
second
time
she
found
on
her
bed
her
letter
and
with
tears
ellen
kneeled
down
and
gave
earnest
thanks
for
this
blessing
and
that
she
had
been
able
to
gain
goodwill

an
absolute
trust

it
was
tuesday
the
of
december
and
late
in
the
day
not
a
pleasant
afternoon
the
grey
hung
low
the
air
was
keen
and
raw
it
was
already
growing
dark
and
alice
was
sitting
alone
in
the
firelight
when
two
little
feet
came
running
round
the
corner
of
the
house
the
glass
door
opened
and
ellen
rushed
in
i
have
come
i
have
come
she
exclaimed
oh

so
glad

was
alice
if
her
kiss
meant
anything
but
how
late
my
child
how
late

oh
i
thought
i
never
was
going
to
get

said
ellen
pulling
off
her
things
in
a
great
hurry
and
throwing
them
on
the
sofa
but
i
am
here
at
last
oh
i
so
glad
why
what

been
the
matter

alice
folding
up
what
ellen
laid
down

winter
what
do
you
think
i
have
been
about

dear
miss
alice
nothing
that

done
you
much
harm
said
alice
smiling
if
i
am
to
guess
from
your
looks
you
are
as
rosy
as
a
good
spitzenberg
yourself
that
very
funny
said
ellen
laughing
for
aunt
fortune
said
awhile
ago
that
my
cheeks
were
just
the
colour
of
two
mealy
potatoes
but
about
the
apples
said
alice
why
this
morning
i
was
thinking
i
would
come
here
so
early
when
the
first
thing
i
knew
aunt
fortune
brought
out
all
those
heaps
and
heaps
of
apples
into
the
kitchen
and
made
me
sit
down
on
the
floor
and
then
she
gave
me
a
great
big
needle
and
set
me
to
stringing
them
all
together
and
as
fast
as
i
strung
them
she
hung
them
up
all
round
the
ceiling
i
tried
very
hard
to
get
through
before
but
i
could
not
and
i
am
so
tired
i
thought
i
never
get
to
the
bottom
of
that
big
basket
never
mind
love
come
to
the
fire
we
try
and
forget
all
disagreeable
things
while
we
are
together
i
have
forgotten
it
almost
already
said
ellen
as
she
sat
down
in
alice
lap
and
laid
her
face
against
hers
i
do
care
for
it
at
all
now
but
her
cheeks
were
fast
fading
into
the
uncomfortable
colour
miss
fortune
had
spoken
of
and
weariness
and
weakness
kept
her
for
awhile
quiet
in
alice
arms
overcoming
even
the
pleasure
of
talking
they
sat
so
till
the
clock
struck
five
then
alice
proposed
they
should
go
into
the
kitchen
and
see
margery
and
order
the
tea
made
which
she
had
no
doubt
ellen
wanted

welcomed
her
with
great
cordiality

liked
anybody
that
alice
liked

she
had
besides
declared
to
her

was
an
uncommon
child

said
humphreys
who
had
come
in
while
she
was
speaking
wait
but
one
moment
in
a
moment
he
came
back
ready
and
he
and
the
woman
set
forth
to
their
walk
alice
looked
out
anxiously
after
them
it
storms
very
hard
she
said
and
he
has
not
had
his
tea
but
he
could
wait
come
ellen
love
we
have
ours
how
will
he
ever
get
back
again
it
will
be
so
deep
by
that
time
there
was
a
cloud
on
the
fair
brow
for
a
few
minutes
but
it
passed
away
and
quiet
and
calm
as
ever
she
sat
down
at
the
little
with
ellen
from
face
all
shadows
seemed
to
have
flown
for
ever
hungry
and
happy
she
enjoyed
margery
good
bread
and
butter
and
the
nice
honey
and
from
time
to
time
cast
very
bright
looks
at
the
dear
face
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
which
could
not
help
looking
bright
in
reply
ellen
was
well
pleased
for
her
part
that
the
third
seat
was
empty
but
alice
looked
thoughtful
sometimes
as
a
gust
of
wind
swept
by
and
once
or
twice
went
to
the
window
after
tea
alice
took
out
her
work
and
ellen
put
herself
contentedly
down
on
the
rug
and
sat
leaning
back
against
her
silent
for
very
contentment
for
a
while
she
sat
looking
gravely
into
the
fire
while
alice
fingers
drove
a
little
steel
hook
through
and
through
some
purse
silk
in
a
mysterious
fashion
that
no
eye
could
be
quick
enough
to
follow
and
with
such
skill
and
steadiness
that
the
work
grew
fast
under
her
hand
i
had
such
a
funny
dream
last
night
said
ellen
did
you
what
about
it
was
pleasant
too
said
ellen
twisting
herself
round
to
talk
but
very
queer
i
dreamed
about
that
gentleman
that
was
so
kind
to
me
on
board
the
boat
you
know
i
told
you
about
him
yes
i
remember
well
i
dreamed
of
seeing
him
somewhere
i
do
know
where
and
he
did
look
a
bit
like
himself
only
i
knew
who
it
was
and
i
thought
i
did
like
to
speak
to
him
for
fear
he
would
know
but
then
i
thought
he
did
and
came
up
and
took
my
hand
and
seemed
so
glad
to
see
me
and
he
asked
me
if
i
had
been
since
he
saw
me
ellen
stopped
to
laugh
and
what
did
you
tell
him
i
told
him
yes
and
then
i
thought
he
seemed
so
very
pleased
dreamers
do
not
always
keep
close
to
the
truth
it
seems
did
said
ellen
but
then
i
thought
i
had
in
my
dream
had
what
kept
close
to
the
truth
no
no
been
what
he
said
dreams
are
queer
things
said
alice
i
have
been
far
enough
from
being
good
said
ellen
thoughtfully
how
so
my
dear
i
do
know
miss
alice
because
i
never
good
i
suppose
but
what
has
been
the
matter
why
those
apples
i
thought
i
would
come
here
so
early
and
then
when
i
found
i
must
do
all
those
baskets
of
apples
first
i
was
very
and
aunt
fortune
saw
i
was
and
said
something
that
made
me
worse
and
i
tried
as
hard
as
i
could
to
get
through
before
dinner
and
when
i
found
i
could
i
said
i
would
come
to
dinner
but
she
made
me
and
that
vexed
me
more
and
i
would
eat
scarcely
anything
and
then
when
i
got
back
to
the
apples
again
i
sewed
so
hard
that
i
ran
the
needle
into
my
finger
ever
so
far
see
there
what
a
mark
it
left
and
aunt
fortune
said
it
served
me
right
and
she
was
glad
of
it
and
that
made
me
angry
i
knew
i
was
wrong
afterwards
and
i
was
very
sorry
is
it
strange
dear
alice
i
should
do
so
when
i
have
resolved
so
hard
i
would
not
very
my
darling
as
long
as
we
have
such
evil
hearts
as
ours
are
it
strange
they
should
be
so
evil
i
told
aunt
fortune
afterwards
i
was
sorry
but
she
said
speak
louder
than
words
and
words
are
cheap
if
she
only
would
say
that
just
as
she
does
it
does
worry
me
so
patience
said
alice
passing
her
hand
over
ellen
hair
as
she
sat
looking
sorrowfully
up
at
her
you
must
try
not
to
give
her
occasion
never
mind
what
she
says
and
overcome
evil
with
good
that
is
just
what
mamma
said
exclaimed
ellen
rising
to
throw
her
arms
round
alice
neck
and
kissing
her
with
all
the
energy
of
love
gratitude
repentance
and
sorrowful
recollection
oh
what
do
you
think
she
said
suddenly
her
face
changing
again
i
got
my
letter
last
night
your
letter
yes
the
letter
the
old
man
brought
do
you
know
and
it
was
written
on
the
ship
and
there
was
only
a
little
bit
from
mamma
and
a
little
bit
from
papa
but
so
good
papa
says
she
is
a
great
deal
better
and
he
has
no
doubt
he
will
bring
her
back
in
the
spring
or
summer
quite
well
again
is
that
good
very
good
dear
ellen
i
am
very
glad
for
you
it
was
on
my
bed
last
night
i
ca
think
how
it
got
there
and
care
either
so
long
as
i
have
got
it
what
are
you
making
a
purse
said
alice
laying
it
on
the
table
for
her
inspection
it
will
be
very
pretty
is
the
other
end
to
be
like
this
yes
and
these
tassels
to
finish
them
off
oh
that
beautiful
said
ellen
laying
them
down
to
try
the
effect
and
these
rings
to
fasten
it
with
is
it
black
no
dark
green
i
am
making
it
for
my
brother
john
a
christmas
present
exclaimed
ellen
i
am
afraid
not
he
will
hardly
be
here
by
that
time
it
may
do
for
new
year
how
pleasant
it
must
be
to
make
christmas
and
new
year
presents
said
ellen
after
she
had
watched
alice
busy
fingers
for
a
few
minutes
i
wish
i
could
make
something
for
somebody
oh
i
wonder
if
i
make
something
for
van
brunt
oh
i
should
like
to
very
much
alice
smiled
at
ellen
very
eyes
what
could
you
make
for
him
i
do
know
that
the
thing
he
keeps
his
money
in
his
pocket
and
besides
i
do
know
how
to
make
purses
there
are
other
things
besides
purses
how
would
a
do
does
he
wear
a
watch
i
do
know
whether
he
does
or
not
he
does
every
day
i
am
sure
but
i
do
know
about
sundays
then
we
wo
venture
upon
that
you
might
knit
him
a
nightcap
a
nightcap
you
joking
alice
are
you
i
do
think
a
nightcap
would
be
pretty
for
a
christmas
present
do
you
well
what
shall
we
do
ellen
said
alice
laughing
i
made
a
pocket
for
papa
once
when
i
was
a
little
girl
but
i
fancy
van
brunt
would
not
know
exactly
what
use
to
make
of
such
a
convenience
i
do
think
you
could
fail
to
please
him
though
with
anything
you
should
hit
upon
i
have
got
a
dollar
said
ellen
to
buy
stuff
with
it
came
in
my
letter
last
night
if
i
only
knew
what
down
she
went
on
the
rug
again
and
alice
worked
in
silence
while
ellen
thoughts
ran
over
every
possible
and
impossible
article
of
van
brunt
dress
i
have
some
nice
pieces
of
fine
linen
said
alice
suppose
i
cut
out
a
collar
for
him
and
you
can
make
it
and
stitch
it
and
then
margery
will
starch
and
iron
it
for
you
all
ready
to
give
to
him
how
will
that
do
can
you
stitch
well
enough
oh
yes
i
guess
i
can
said
ellen
oh
thank
you
dear
alice
you
are
the
best
help
that
ever
was
will
he
like
that
do
you
think
i
am
sure
he
will
very
much
then
that
will
do
nicely
said
ellen
much
relieved
and
now
what
do
you
think
about
nancy
bible
nothing
could
be
better
only
that
i
am
afraid
nancy
would
either
sell
it
for
something
else
or
let
it
go
to
destruction
very
quickly
i
never
heard
of
her
spending
five
minutes
over
a
book
and
the
bible
i
am
afraid
last
of
all
but
i
think
said
ellen
slowly
i
think
she
would
not
spoil
it
or
sell
it
either
if
gave
it
to
her
and
she
told
alice
about
nancy
asking
for
the
kiss
last
night
that
the
most
hopeful
thing
i
have
heard
about
nancy
for
a
long
time
said
alice
we
will
get
her
the
bible
by
all
means
my
dear
a
nice
one
and
i
hope
you
will
be
able
to
persuade
her
to
read
it
she
rose
as
she
spoke
and
went
to
the
glass
door
ellen
followed
her
and
they
looked
out
into
the
night
it
was
very
dark
she
opened
the
door
a
moment
but
the
wind
drove
the
snow
into
their
faces
and
they
were
glad
to
shut
it
again
it
almost
as
bad
as
the
night
we
were
out
is
it
said
ellen
not
such
a
heavy
fall
of
snow
i
think
but
it
is
very
windy
and
cold
papa
will
be
late
getting
home
i
am
sorry
you
are
worried
dear
alice
i
am
not
worried
love
i
have
often
known
papa
out
late
before
but
this
is
rather
a
hard
night
for
a
long
walk
come
we
try
to
make
a
good
use
of
the
time
while
we
are
waiting
suppose
you
read
to
me
while
i
work
she
took
down
a
volume
of
cowper
and
found
his
account
of
the
three
pet
hares
ellen
read
it
and
then
several
of
his
smaller
pieces
of
poetry
then
followed
a
long
talk
about
hares
and
other
animals
about
cowper
and
his
friends
and
his
way
of
life
time
passed
swiftly
away
it
was
getting
late
how
weary
papa
will
be
said
alice
he
has
had
nothing
to
eat
since
dinner
i
tell
you
what
we
do
ellen
she
exclaimed
as
she
threw
her
work
down
we
make
some
chocolate
for
him
that
be
the
very
thing
ellen
dear
run
into
the
kitchen
and
ask
margery
to
bring
me
the
little
chocolate
pot
and
a
pitcher
of
night
milk
margery
brought
them
the
pot
was
set
on
the
coals
and
alice
had
cut
up
the
chocolate
that
it
might
melt
the
quicker
ellen
watched
it
with
great
interest
till
it
was
melted
and
the
boiling
water
stirred
in
and
the
whole
was
simmering
quietly
on
the
coals
is
it
done
now
no
it
must
boil
a
little
while
and
then
the
milk
must
be
put
in
and
when
that
is
boiled
the
eggs
and
then
it
will
be
done
with
margery
and
the
chocolate
pot
the
cat
had
walked
in
ellen
immediately
tried
to
improve
his
acquaintance
that
was
not
so
easy
the
captain
chose
the
corner
of
the
rug
farthest
from
her
in
spite
of
all
her
calling
and
coaxing
paying
her
no
more
attention
than
if
he
had
not
heard
her
ellen
crossed
over
to
him
and
began
most
tenderly
and
respectfully
to
stroke
his
head
and
back
touching
his
soft
hair
with
great
care
parry
presently
lifted
up
his
head
uneasily
as
much
as
to
say
i
wonder
how
long
this
is
going
to
last
and
finding
there
was
every
prospect
of
its
lasting
some
time
he
fairly
got
up
and
walked
to
the
other
end
of
the
rug
ellen
followed
him
and
tried
again
with
exactly
the
same
effect
well
cat
you
are
very
kind
said
she
at
length
alice
he
let
me
have
anything
to
do
with
him
i
am
sorry
my
dear
he
is
so
unsociable
he
is
a
cat
of
very
bad
taste
that
is
all
i
can
say
but
i
never
saw
such
a
cat
he
wo
let
me
touch
him
ever
so
softly
he
lifts
up
his
head
and
looks
as
cross
and
then
walks
off
he
do
know
you
yet
and
truth
is
parry
has
no
fancy
for
extending
the
circle
of
his
acquaintance
oh
kitty
kitty
said
alice
fondly
stroking
his
head
why
do
you
behave
better
parry
lifted
his
head
and
opened
and
shut
his
eyes
with
an
expression
of
great
satisfaction
very
different
from
that
he
had
bestowed
on
ellen
ellen
gave
him
up
for
the
present
as
a
hopeless
case
and
turned
her
attention
to
the
chocolate
which
had
now
received
the
milk
and
must
be
watched
lest
it
should
run
over
which
alice
said
it
would
very
easily
do
when
once
it
began
to
boil
again
meanwhile
ellen
wanted
to
know
what
chocolate
was
made
of
where
it
came
from
where
it
was
made
best
burning
her
little
face
in
the
fire
all
the
time
lest
the
pot
should
boil
over
while
she
was
not
looking
at
last
the
chocolate
began
to
gather
a
rich
froth
and
ellen
called
out
oh
alice
look
here
quick
here
the
shape
of
the
spoon
on
the
top
of
the
chocolate
do
look
at
it
an
iron
spoon
was
in
the
pot
and
its
shape
was
distinctly
raised
on
the
smooth
frothy
surface
as
they
were
both
bending
forward
to
watch
it
alice
waiting
to
take
the
pot
off
the
moment
it
began
to
boil
ellen
heard
a
slight
click
of
the
lock
of
the
door
and
turning
her
head
was
a
little
startled
to
see
a
stranger
there
standing
still
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
she
touched
alice
arm
without
looking
round
but
alice
started
to
her
feet
with
a
slight
scream
and
in
another
minute
had
thrown
her
arms
round
the
stranger
and
was
locked
in
his
ellen
knew
what
it
meant
now
very
well
she
turned
away
as
if
she
had
nothing
to
do
with
what
was
going
on
there
and
lifted
the
pot
of
chocolate
off
the
fire
with
infinite
difficulty
but
it
was
going
to
boil
over
and
she
would
have
broken
her
back
rather
than
not
do
it
and
then
she
stood
with
her
back
to
the
brother
and
sister
looking
into
the
fire
as
if
she
was
determined
not
to
see
them
till
she
could
help
it
but
what
she
was
thinking
of
ellen
could
not
have
told
then
or
afterward
it
was
but
a
few
minutes
though
it
seemed
to
her
a
great
many
before
they
drew
near
the
fire
curiosity
began
to
be
strong
and
she
looked
round
to
see
if
the
was
like
alice
no
not
a
bit
how
different
darker
hair
and
eyes
not
a
bit
like
her
handsome
enough
too
to
be
her
brother
and
alice
did
not
look
like
herself
her
usually
calm
sweet
face
was
quivering
and
sparkling
now
lit
up
as
ellen
had
never
seen
it
oh
how
bright
poor
ellen
herself
had
never
looked
duller
in
her
life
and
when
alice
said
gaily
this
is
my
brother
ellen
her
confusion
of
thoughts
and
feelings
resolved
themselves
into
a
flood
of
tears
she
sprang
and
hid
her
face
in
alice
arms
ellen
were
not
the
only
eyes
that
were
full
just
then
but
of
course
she
did
know
that
come
ellen
whispered
alice
presently
look
up
what
kind
of
a
welcome
is
this
come
we
have
no
business
with
tears
just
now
you
run
into
the
kitchen
for
me
love
she
added
more
low
and
ask
margery
to
bring
some
bread
and
butter
and
anything
else
she
has
that
is
fit
for
a
traveller
glad
of
an
escape
ellen
darted
away
that
her
wet
face
might
not
be
seen
the
brother
and
sister
were
busily
talking
when
she
returned
john
said
alice
this
is
my
little
sister
that
i
wrote
to
you
about
ellen
montgomery
ellen
this
is
your
brother
as
well
as
mine
you
know
stop
stop
said
her
brother
miss
ellen
this
sister
of
mine
is
giving
us
away
to
each
other
at
a
great
rate
i
should
like
to
know
first
what
you
say
to
it
are
you
willing
to
take
a
strange
brother
upon
her
recommendation
half
inclined
to
laugh
ellen
glanced
at
the
speaker
face
but
meeting
the
grave
though
somewhat
comical
look
of
two
very
keen
eyes
she
looked
down
again
and
merely
answered
yes
then
if
i
am
to
be
your
brother
you
must
give
me
a
brother
right
you
know
said
he
drawing
her
gently
to
him
and
kissing
her
gravely
on
the
lips
probably
ellen
thought
there
was
a
difference
between
john
humphreys
and
van
brunt
or
the
young
gentlemen
of
the
for
though
she
coloured
a
good
deal
she
made
no
objection
and
showed
no
displeasure
alice
and
she
now
busied
themselves
with
getting
the
cups
and
saucers
out
of
the
cupboard
and
setting
the
table
but
all
that
evening
through
whatever
was
doing
ellen
eyes
sought
the
stranger
as
if
by
fascination
she
watched
him
whenever
she
could
without
being
noticed
at
first
she
was
in
doubt
what
to
think
of
him
she
was
quite
sure
from
that
one
look
into
his
eyes
that
he
was
a
person
to
be
feared
there
was
no
doubt
of
that
as
to
the
rest
she
did
know
and
what
have
my
two
sisters
been
doing
to
spend
the
evening
said
john
humphreys
one
time
that
alice
was
gone
into
the
kitchen
on
some
kind
errand
for
him
talking
sir
said
ellen
doubtfully
talking
this
whole
evening
alice
must
have
improved
what
have
you
been
talking
about
hares
and
dogs
and
about
cowper
and
some
other
things
private
affairs
eh
said
he
with
again
the
look
ellen
had
seen
before
yes
sir
said
ellen
nodding
and
laughing
and
how
came
you
upon
mr
cowper
sir
how
came
you
to
be
talking
about
mr
cowper
i
was
reading
about
his
hares
and
about
john
gilpin
and
then
alice
told
me
about
cowper
and
his
friends
well
i
do
know
after
all
that
you
have
had
a
pleasanter
evening
than
i
have
had
said
her
questioner
though
i
have
been
riding
hard
with
the
cold
wind
in
my
face
and
the
driving
snow
doing
all
it
could
to
discomfort
me
i
have
had
this
very
bright
fireside
before
me
all
the
way
he
fell
into
a
fit
of
grave
musing
which
lasted
till
alice
came
in
then
suddenly
fell
a
fumbling
in
his
pocket
here
a
note
for
you
said
he
throwing
it
into
her
lap
a
note
sophia
marshman
where
did
you
get
it
from
her
own
hand
passing
there
i
thought
i
must
stop
a
moment
to
speak
to
them
and
had
no
notion
of
doing
more
but
marshman
was
very
kind
and
miss
sophia
in
despair
so
the
end
of
it
was
i
dismounted
and
went
in
to
await
the
preparing
of
that
billet
while
my
poor
nag
was
led
off
to
the
stables
and
a
fresh
horse
supplied
me
i
fancy
that
tells
you
on
what
conditions
charming
said
alice
to
spend
christmas
i
am
very
glad
i
should
like
to
very
much
with
you
dear
if
i
can
only
get
papa
but
i
think
he
will
it
will
do
him
a
great
deal
of
good
she
says
we
must
come
but
i
doubt
the
weather
will
not
let
us
we
shall
see
i
rode
prince
charlie
down
he
is
a
good
traveller
and
the
sleighing
will
be
fine
if
the
snow
be
not
too
deep
the
old
sleigh
is
in
being
yet
i
suppose
oh
yes
in
good
order
ellen
what
are
you
looking
so
grave
about
you
are
going
too
i
said
ellen
a
great
spot
of
crimson
coming
in
each
cheek
to
be
sure
do
you
think
i
am
going
to
leave
you
behind
but
but
what
there
wo
be
room
room
in
the
sleigh
then
we
put
john
on
prince
charlie
and
let
him
ride
there
but
mr
humphreys
he
always
goes
on
horseback
he
will
ride
sharp
or
old
john
in
great
delight
ellen
gave
alice
an
earnest
kiss
and
then
they
all
gathered
round
the
table
to
take
their
chocolate
or
rather
to
see
john
take
his
which
his
sister
would
not
let
him
wait
for
any
longer
the
storm
had
ceased
and
through
the
broken
clouds
the
moon
and
stars
were
looking
out
so
they
were
no
more
uneasy
for
humphreys
and
expected
him
every
moment
still
the
supper
was
begun
and
ended
without
him
and
they
had
drawn
round
the
fire
again
before
his
welcome
step
was
at
last
heard
there
was
new
joy
then
new
embracing
and
questioning
and
answering
the
little
circle
opened
to
let
him
in
and
alice
brought
the
corner
of
the
table
to
his
side
and
poured
him
out
a
cup
of
hot
chocolate
but
after
drinking
half
of
it
and
neglecting
the
eatables
beside
him
he
sat
with
one
hand
in
the
other
his
arm
leaning
on
his
knee
with
a
kind
of
softened
gravity
upon
his
countenance
is
your
chocolate
right
papa
said
alice
at
length
good
my
daughter
he
finished
the
cup
but
then
went
back
to
his
old
attitude
and
look
gradually
they
ceased
their
conversation
and
waited
with
respectful
affection
and
some
curiosity
for
him
to
speak
something
of
more
than
common
interest
seemed
to
be
in
his
thoughts
he
sat
looking
earnestly
in
the
fire
sometimes
with
almost
a
smile
on
his
face
and
gently
striking
one
hand
in
the
palm
of
the
other
and
sitting
so
without
moving
or
stirring
his
eyes
he
said
at
last
as
though
the
words
had
been
forced
from
him
thanks
be
unto
god
for
his
unspeakable
gift
as
he
added
no
more
alice
said
gently
what
have
you
seen
papa
he
roused
himself
and
pushed
the
empty
cup
towards
her
a
little
more
my
daughter
i
have
seen
the
fairest
sight
almost
a
man
can
see
in
this
world
i
have
seen
a
little
ransomed
spirit
go
home
to
its
rest
oh
that
gift
he
pressed
his
lips
thoughtfully
together
while
he
stirred
his
chocolate
but
having
drunk
it
he
pushed
the
table
from
him
and
drew
up
his
chair
you
had
a
long
way
to
go
papa
observed
alice
again
yes
a
long
way
there
i
do
know
what
it
was
coming
home
i
never
thought
of
it
how
independent
the
spirit
can
be
of
externals
i
scarcely
felt
the
storm
nor
i
said
his
son
i
had
a
long
way
to
go
said
humphreys
that
poor
woman
that
dolan
she
lives
in
the
woods
behind
the
cat
back
a
mile
beyond
or
more
it
seemed
a
long
mile
and
a
more
miserable
place
i
never
saw
yet
a
little
rickety
shanty
the
storm
was
hardly
kept
out
of
it
and
no
appearance
of
comfort
or
nicety
anywhere
or
in
anything
there
were
several
men
gathered
round
the
fire
and
in
a
corner
on
a
miserable
kind
of
bed
i
saw
the
sick
child
his
eye
met
mine
the
moment
i
went
in
and
i
thought
i
had
seen
him
before
but
could
at
first
make
out
where
do
you
remember
alice
a
little
ragged
boy
with
a
remarkably
bright
pleasant
face
who
has
planted
himself
regularly
every
sunday
morning
for
some
time
past
in
the
south
aisle
of
the
church
and
stood
there
all
service
time
alice
said
no
i
have
noticed
him
often
and
noticed
him
as
paying
a
most
fixed
and
steady
attention
i
have
repeatedly
tried
to
catch
him
on
his
way
out
of
church
to
speak
to
him
but
always
failed
i
asked
him
when
i
first
went
in
if
he
knew
me
do
sir
he
said
i
asked
him
where
he
had
seen
me
he
said
the
church
beyant
said
i
are
the
little
boy
i
have
seen
there
so
regularly
what
did
you
come
there
for
hear
yer
honour
spake
the
good
words
good
words
said
i
what
he
said
him
that
was
slain
and
washed
us
from
our
sins
in
his
own
blood
do
you
think
he
has
washed
away
yours
i
said
he
smiled
at
me
very
expressively
i
suppose
it
was
somewhat
difficult
for
him
to
speak
and
to
tell
the
truth
so
it
was
for
me
for
i
was
taken
by
surprise
but
the
people
in
the
hut
had
gathered
round
and
i
wished
to
hear
him
say
more
for
their
sake
as
well
as
my
own
i
asked
him
why
he
thought
his
sins
were
washed
away
he
gave
me
for
answer
part
of
the
verse
little
children
to
come
unto
me
but
did
not
finish
it
you
think
you
are
very
sick
john
i
asked
am
sir
he
said
not
be
long
here
where
do
you
think
you
are
going
then
said
i
he
lifted
one
little
thin
bony
arm
from
under
his
coverlid
and
through
all
the
dirt
and
pallor
of
his
face
the
smile
of
heaven
i
am
sure
was
on
it
as
he
looked
and
pointed
upward
and
answered
i
asked
him
presently
as
soon
as
i
could
what
he
had
wished
to
see
me
for
i
do
know
whether
he
heard
me
or
not
he
lay
with
his
eyes
half
closed
breathing
with
difficulty
i
doubted
whether
he
would
speak
again
and
indeed
for
myself
i
had
heard
and
seen
enough
to
satisfy
me
entirely
for
the
sake
of
the
group
around
the
bed
i
could
have
desired
something
further
they
kept
perfect
stillness
awed
i
think
by
a
profession
of
faith
such
as
they
had
never
heard
before
they
and
i
stood
watching
him
and
at
the
end
of
a
few
minutes
not
more
than
ten
or
fifteen
he
opened
his
eyes
and
with
sudden
life
and
strength
rose
up
half
way
in
bed
exclaiming
be
to
god
for
his
unspeakable
gift
and
then
fell
back
just
dead
the
old
gentleman
voice
was
husky
as
he
finished
for
alice
and
ellen
were
both
weeping
and
john
humphreys
had
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
i
have
felt
said
the
old
gentleman
presently
as
if
i
could
have
shouted
out
his
words
his
dying
words
all
the
way
as
i
came
home
my
little
girl
said
he
drawing
ellen
to
him
do
you
know
the
meaning
of
those
sweet
things
of
which
little
john
dolan
mind
was
so
full
ellen
did
not
speak
do
you
know
what
it
is
to
be
a
sinner
and
what
it
is
to
be
a
forgiven
child
of
god
i
believe
i
do
sir
ellen
said
he
kissed
her
forehead
and
blessed
her
and
then
said
let
us
pray
it
was
late
the
servants
had
gone
to
bed
and
they
were
alone
oh
what
a
thanksgiving
humphreys
poured
forth
for
that
unspeakable
gift
that
they
every
one
there
had
been
made
to
know
and
rejoice
in
it
for
the
poor
little
boy
rich
in
faith
who
had
just
gone
home
in
the
same
rejoicing
for
their
own
loved
one
who
was
there
already
and
for
the
hope
of
joining
them
soon
in
safety
and
joy
to
sing
with
them
the
new
song
for
ever
and
ever
there
were
no
dry
eyes
in
the
room
and
when
they
arose
humphreys
after
giving
his
daughter
the
usual
kiss
for
gave
one
to
ellen
too
which
he
had
never
done
before
and
then
going
to
his
son
and
laying
both
hands
on
his
shoulders
kissed
his
cheek
also
then
silently
took
his
candle
and
went
they
lingered
a
little
while
after
he
was
gone
standing
round
the
fire
as
if
loth
to
part
but
in
grave
silence
each
busy
with
his
own
thoughts
alice
ended
by
fixing
on
her
brother
for
laying
her
hand
and
her
head
carelessly
on
his
shoulder
she
said
and
so
you
have
been
well
all
this
time
john
he
turned
his
face
towards
her
without
speaking
but
ellen
as
well
as
his
sister
saw
the
look
of
love
with
which
he
answered
her
question
rather
of
endearment
than
inquiry
and
from
that
minute
ellen
mind
was
made
up
as
to
the
doubt
which
had
troubled
her
she
went
to
bed
quite
satisfied
that
her
new
brother
was
a
decided
acquisition
chapter
xxvii
the
night
was
winter
in
his
roughest
mood
the
morning
sharp
and
clear
the
vault
is
blue
without
a
cloud
and
white
without
a
speck
the
dazzling
splendour
of
the
scene
below
cowper
before
ellen
eyes
were
open
the
next
morning
almost
before
she
awoke
the
thought
of
the
christmas
visit
the
john
humphreys
and
the
weather
all
rushed
into
her
mind
at
once
and
started
her
half
up
in
the
bed
to
look
out
of
the
window
well
frosted
the
panes
of
glass
were
but
at
the
corners
and
edges
unmistakable
bright
gleams
of
light
came
in
oh
alice
it
beautiful
exclaimed
ellen
look
how
the
sun
is
shining
and
is
very
cold
are
we
going
i
do
know
yet
ellie
but
we
shall
know
very
soon
we
settle
that
at
breakfast
at
breakfast
it
was
settled
they
were
to
go
and
set
off
directly
humphreys
could
not
go
with
them
because
he
had
promised
to
bury
little
john
dolan
the
priest
had
declared
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
the
poor
mother
had
applied
to
humphreys
as
being
the
clergyman
her
child
had
most
trusted
and
loved
to
hear
it
seemed
that
little
john
had
persuaded
her
out
of
half
her
prejudices
by
his
affectionate
talk
and
blameless
behaviour
during
some
time
past
humphreys
therefore
must
stay
at
home
that
day
he
promised
however
to
follow
them
the
next
and
would
by
no
means
permit
them
to
wait
for
him
he
said
the
day
was
fine
and
they
must
improve
it
and
he
should
be
pleased
to
have
them
with
their
friends
as
long
as
possible
so
the
little
travelling
bag
was
stuffed
with
more
things
than
it
seemed
possible
to
get
into
it
among
the
rest
ellen
brought
her
little
red
bible
which
alice
decided
should
go
in
john
pocket
the
little
could
not
take
it
ellen
was
afraid
it
never
would
be
locked
by
dint
of
much
pushing
and
crowding
however
locked
it
was
and
they
made
themselves
ready
over
ellen
merino
dress
and
coat
went
an
old
fur
tippet
a
little
shawl
was
tied
round
her
neck
her
feet
were
cased
in
a
pair
of
warm
moccasins
which
belonging
to
margery
were
of
course
a
world
too
big
for
her
but
anything
but
cold
as
their
owner
said
her
nice
blue
hood
would
protect
her
head
well
and
alice
gave
her
a
green
veil
to
save
her
eyes
from
the
glare
of
the
snow
when
ellen
shuffled
out
of
alice
room
in
this
trim
john
gave
her
one
of
his
grave
looks
and
saying
she
looked
like
mother
bunch
begged
to
know
how
she
expected
to
get
to
the
sleigh
he
said
she
would
want
a
indeed
to
wait
upon
her
to
pick
up
her
slippers
if
she
went
in
that
fashion
however
he
ended
by
picking
up
carried
her
and
set
her
down
safely
in
the
sleigh
alice
followed
and
in
another
minute
they
were
off
ellen
delight
was
unbounded
presently
they
turned
round
a
corner
and
left
the
house
behind
out
of
sight
and
they
were
speeding
away
along
a
road
that
was
quite
new
to
her
ellen
heart
felt
like
dancing
for
joy
nobody
would
have
thought
it
she
sat
so
still
and
quiet
between
alice
and
her
brother
but
her
eyes
were
very
bright
as
they
looked
joyously
about
her
and
every
now
and
then
she
could
not
help
smiling
to
herself
nothing
was
wanting
to
the
pleasure
of
that
ride
the
day
was
of
winter
fairest
the
blue
sky
as
clear
as
if
clouds
had
never
dimmed
or
crossed
it
none
crossed
it
now
it
was
cold
but
not
bitterly
cold
nor
windy
the
sleigh
skimmed
along
over
the
smooth
frozen
surface
of
the
snow
as
if
it
was
no
trouble
at
all
to
prince
charlie
to
draw
it
and
the
jingled
and
rang
the
very
music
for
ellen
thoughts
to
dance
to
and
then
with
somebody
she
liked
very
much
on
each
side
of
her
and
pleasures
untold
in
the
prospect
no
wonder
she
felt
as
if
her
heart
could
not
hold
any
more
the
green
veil
could
not
be
kept
on
everything
looked
so
beautiful
in
that
morning
sun
the
long
wide
slopes
of
untrodden
and
unspotted
snow
too
bright
sometimes
for
the
eye
to
look
at
the
shadows
that
here
and
there
lay
upon
it
of
woodland
and
scattered
trees
the
very
brown
fences
and
the
bare
arms
and
branches
of
the
leafless
trees
showing
sharp
against
the
white
ground
and
clear
bright
heaven
all
seemed
lovely
in
her
eyes
for
it
is
content
of
heart
gives
nature
power
to
please
she
could
see
nothing
that
was
not
pleasant
and
besides
they
were
in
a
nice
little
red
sleigh
with
a
warm
buffalo
robe
and
prince
charlie
was
a
fine
spirited
grey
that
scarcely
ever
needed
to
be
touched
with
the
whip
at
a
word
of
encouragement
from
his
driver
he
would
toss
his
head
and
set
forward
with
new
life
making
all
the
bells
jingle
again
to
be
sure
she
would
have
been
just
as
happy
if
they
had
had
the
poorest
of
vehicles
on
runners
with
old
john
instead
but
still
it
was
pleasanter
so
their
road
at
first
was
through
a
fine
undulating
country
like
that
between
the
nose
and
thirlwall
farmhouses
and
patches
of
woodland
scattered
here
and
there
it
would
seem
that
the
minds
of
all
the
party
were
full
of
the
same
thoughts
for
after
a
very
long
silence
first
word
almost
sigh
was
this
is
a
beautiful
world
john
beautiful
wherever
you
can
escape
from
the
signs
of
man
presence
and
influence
is
that
almost
too
strong
said
alice
he
shook
his
head
smiling
somewhat
sadly
and
touched
prince
charlie
who
was
indulging
himself
in
a
walk
but
there
are
bright
exceptions
said
alice
i
believe
it
never
so
much
as
when
i
come
home
are
there
none
around
you
then
in
whom
you
can
have
confidence
and
sympathy
he
shook
his
head
again
not
enough
alice
i
long
for
you
every
day
of
my
life
alice
turned
her
head
quick
away
it
must
be
so
my
dear
sister
he
said
presently
we
can
never
expect
to
find
it
otherwise
there
are
as
you
say
bright
exceptions
many
of
them
but
in
almost
all
i
find
some
sad
want
we
must
wait
till
we
join
the
spirits
of
the
just
made
perfect
before
we
see
society
that
will
be
all
we
wish
for
what
is
ellen
thinking
of
all
this
while
said
alice
presently
bending
down
to
see
her
face
as
grave
as
a
judge
what
are
you
musing
about
i
was
thinking
said
ellen
how
men
could
help
the
world
being
beautiful
do
trouble
your
little
head
with
that
question
said
john
smiling
long
may
it
be
before
you
are
able
to
answer
it
look
at
those
snowbirds
by
degrees
the
day
wore
on
about
one
they
stopped
at
a
to
let
the
horse
rest
and
to
stretch
their
own
limbs
which
ellen
for
her
part
was
very
glad
to
do
the
people
of
the
house
received
them
with
great
hospitality
and
offered
them
pumpkin
pies
and
sweet
cider
alice
had
brought
a
basket
of
sandwiches
and
prince
charlie
was
furnished
with
a
bag
of
corn
thomas
had
stowed
away
in
the
sleigh
for
him
so
they
were
all
well
refreshed
and
rested
and
warmed
before
they
set
off
again
from
home
to
ventnor
marshman
place
was
more
than
thirty
miles
and
the
longest
because
the
most
difficult
part
of
the
way
was
still
before
them
ellen
however
soon
became
sleepy
from
riding
in
the
keen
air
she
was
content
now
to
have
the
green
veil
over
her
face
and
sitting
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
sleigh
her
head
leaning
against
alice
and
covered
well
with
the
buffalo
robe
she
slept
in
happy
unconsciousness
of
hill
and
dale
wind
and
sun
and
all
the
remaining
hours
of
the
way
it
was
drawing
towards
four
when
alice
with
some
difficulty
roused
her
to
see
the
approach
to
the
house
and
get
wide
awake
before
they
should
reach
it
they
turned
from
the
road
and
entered
by
a
gateway
into
some
through
which
a
short
drive
brought
them
to
the
house
these
grounds
were
fine
but
the
wide
lawns
were
a
smooth
spread
of
snow
now
the
great
skeletons
of
oaks
and
elms
were
bare
and
wintry
and
patches
of
shrubbery
offered
little
but
tufts
and
bunches
of
brown
twigs
and
stems
it
might
have
looked
dreary
but
that
some
evergreens
were
clustered
round
the
house
and
others
scattered
here
and
there
relieved
the
eye
a
few
holly
bushes
singly
and
in
groups
proudly
displayed
their
bright
dark
leaves
and
red
berries
and
one
unrivalled
hemlock
on
the
west
threw
its
graceful
shadow
quite
across
the
lawn
on
which
as
on
itself
the
white
and
the
naked
branches
of
oaks
and
elms
was
the
faint
smile
of
the
afternoon
sun
a
servant
came
to
take
the
horse
and
ellen
being
first
rid
of
her
moccasins
went
with
john
and
alice
up
the
broad
flight
of
steps
and
into
the
house
they
entered
a
large
handsome
square
hall
with
a
blue
and
white
stone
floor
at
one
side
of
which
the
staircase
went
winding
up
here
they
were
met
by
a
young
lady
very
lively
and
who
threw
her
arms
round
alice
and
kissed
her
a
great
many
times
seeming
very
glad
indeed
to
see
her
she
welcomed
ellen
too
with
such
warmth
that
she
began
to
feel
almost
as
if
she
had
been
sent
for
and
expected
told
john
he
had
behaved
admirably
and
then
led
them
into
a
large
room
where
was
a
group
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
the
welcome
they
got
here
was
less
lively
but
quite
as
kind
and
marshman
were
fine
handsome
old
people
of
stately
presence
and
most
dignified
as
well
as
kind
in
their
deportment
ellen
saw
that
alice
was
at
home
here
as
if
she
had
been
a
daughter
of
the
family
marshman
also
stooped
down
and
kissed
herself
telling
her
she
was
very
glad
she
had
come
and
that
there
were
a
number
of
young
people
there
who
would
be
much
pleased
to
have
her
help
them
keep
christmas
ellen
could
not
make
out
yet
who
any
of
the
rest
of
the
company
were
john
and
alice
seemed
to
know
them
all
and
there
was
a
buzz
of
pleasant
voices
and
a
great
bustle
of
shaking
hands
the
children
had
all
gone
out
to
walk
and
as
they
had
had
their
dinner
a
great
while
ago
it
was
decided
that
ellen
should
take
hers
that
day
with
the
elder
part
of
the
family
while
they
were
waiting
to
be
called
to
dinner
and
everybody
else
was
talking
and
laughing
old
marshman
took
notice
of
little
ellen
and
drawing
her
from
alice
side
to
his
own
began
a
long
conversation
he
asked
her
a
great
many
questions
some
of
them
such
funny
ones
that
she
could
not
help
laughing
but
she
answered
them
all
and
now
and
then
so
that
she
made
him
laugh
too
by
the
time
the
butler
came
to
say
dinner
was
ready
she
had
almost
forgotten
she
was
a
stranger
marshman
himself
led
her
to
the
begging
the
elder
ladies
would
excuse
him
but
he
felt
bound
to
give
his
attention
to
the
greatest
stranger
in
the
company
he
placed
her
on
his
right
hand
and
took
the
greatest
care
of
her
all
once
sending
her
plate
the
whole
length
of
the
table
for
some
particular
little
thing
he
thought
she
would
like
on
the
other
side
of
ellen
sat
chauncey
one
of
marshman
daughters
a
lady
with
a
sweet
gentle
quiet
face
and
manner
that
made
ellen
like
to
sit
by
her
another
daughter
gillespie
had
more
of
her
stately
bearing
the
third
miss
sophia
who
met
them
first
in
the
hall
was
very
unlike
both
the
others
but
lively
and
agreeable
and
dinner
gave
place
to
the
dessert
and
that
in
its
turn
was
removed
with
the
cloth
ellen
was
engaged
in
munching
almonds
and
raisins
admiring
the
brightness
of
the
mahogany
and
the
and
coloured
glass
and
silver
decanter
stands
which
were
reflected
in
it
when
a
door
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
a
little
figure
came
partly
in
and
holding
the
door
in
her
hand
stood
looking
doubtfully
along
the
table
as
if
seeking
for
some
one
what
is
the
matter
ellen
said
chauncey
mrs
bland
told
me
mamma
she
began
her
eye
not
ceasing
its
uneasy
quest
but
then
breaking
off
and
springing
to
alice
side
she
threw
her
arms
around
her
neck
and
gave
her
certainly
the
warmest
of
all
the
warm
welcomes
she
had
had
that
day
hallo
cried
marshman
rapping
on
the
table
that
too
much
for
any
one
share
come
here
you
baggage
and
give
me
just
such
another
the
little
girl
came
near
accordingly
and
hugged
and
kissed
him
with
a
very
good
will
remarking
however
ah
but
i
seen
you
before
grandpapa

he
pulling
her
round
to
ellen

friend

young
lady
from
the
great
city
so

must
brush
up
your
country
manners
miss
ellen
montgomery
come
from
pshaw
what
is
it
come
from
london
grandpapa
said
the
little
girl
as
with
a
mixture
of
simplicity
and
kindness
she
took
ellen
hand
and
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
from
sir
said
ellen
smiling

along
with
you
said
he
laughing
and
pinching
her
cheek
take
her
away
ellen
take
her
away
and
mind
you
take
good
care
of
her
tell
mrs
bland
she
is
one
of
grandpapa
guests
the
two
children
had
not
however
reached
the
door
when
ellen
chauncey
exclaimed
wait
oh
wait
a
minute
i
must
speak
to
aunt
sophia
about
the
bag
and
flying
to
her
side
there
followed
an
earnest
whispering
and
then
a
nod
and
a
smile
from
aunt
sophia
and
satisfied
ellen
returned
to
her
companion
and
led
her
out
of
the
we
have
both
got
the
same
name
said
she
as
they
went
along
a
wide
corridor
how
shall
we
know
which
is
which
why
said
ellen
laughing
when
you
say
i
shall
know
you
mean
me
and
when
i
say
it
you
will
know
i
mean
you
i
should

when
somebody
else

said
ellen
laughing
ah
but
i
do
always

i
thought
perhaps
you
were
like
marianne
gillespie
she
waits
often
as
much
as
before
she
stirs
when
anybody
calls
her
did
you
come
with
miss
alice
yes
do
you
love
her
very
much
oh
very
much
little
ellen
looked
at
her
companion
rising
colour
with
a
glance
of
mixed
curiosity
and
pleasure
in
which
lay
a
strong
promise
of
growing
love
so
do
i
she
answered
gaily
i
am
very
glad
she
is
come
and
i
am
very
glad
you
are
come
too
the
little
speaker
pushed
open
a
door
and
led
ellen
into
the
presence
of
a
group
of
young
people
rather
older
than
themselves
marianne
said
she
to
one
of
them
a
handsome
girl
of
fourteen

is
miss

one
of
grandpapa

little
ellen
chauncey
and
he
says

our
country
manners
she

from
the
great
city
do
you
think
we
are
a
set
of
ignoramuses
miss
ellen
inquired
a
boy
of
fifteen
who
looked
enough
like
marianne
gillespie
to
prove
him
her
brother
i
do
know
what
that
is
said
ellen
well
do
they
do
things

great
city
than

do
here
i
do
know
how

do
them
here
said
ellen
do
you
come
stand
out
of
my
way
right
and
left
all
of
you
will
you
and
give
me
a
chance
now
then
conscious
that
he
was
amusing
most
of
the
party
he
placed
himself
gravely
at
a
little
distance
from
ellen
and
marching
solemnly
up
to
her
bowed
down
to
her
knees
then
slowly
raising
his
head
stepped
back
miss
ellen
montgomery
i
am
rejoiced
to
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing

polite
now

been
accustomed
to
miss
montgomery

said
ellen
who
laughed
in
spite
of
herself
the
mirth
of
the
others
redoubled
may
i
request
to
be
informed
then
continued
gillespie
what
is
the
fashion
of
making
bows
in
the
great
city
i
do
know
said
ellen
i
never
saw
a
boy
make
a
bow
before
humph
i
guess
country
manners
will
do
for
you
said
william
turning
on
his
heel
you
giving
her
a
pretty
specimen
of
bill
said
another
boy
for
shame
william
cried
little
ellen
chauncey
did
i
tell
you
she
was
one
of
grandpapa
guests
come
here
ellen
i
take
you
somewhere
else
she
seized
ellen
hand
and
pulled
her
towards
the
door
but
suddenly
stopped
again
oh
i
forgot
to
tell
you
she
said
i
asked
aunt
sophia
about
the
bag
of
moroccos
and
she
said
she
would
have
early
morning
and
then
we
can
divide
right
away
we
must
divide
till
maggie
comes
said
marianne
oh
no
not
till
maggie
comes
said
little
ellen
and
then
ran
off
again
i
am
so
glad
you
are
come
said
she
the
others
are
all
so
much
older
and
they
have
all
so
much
to
do
together
and
now
you
can
help
me
think
what
i
will
make
for
mamma
hush
do
say
a
word
about
it
they
entered
the
large
where
old
and
young
were
gathered
for
tea
the
children
who
had
dined
early
sat
down
to
a
table
at
which
miss
sophia
presided
the
elder
persons
were
standing
or
sitting
in
different
parts
of
the
room
ellen
not
being
hungry
had
leisure
to
look
about
her
and
her
eye
soon
wandered
from
the
in
search
of
her
old
friends
alice
was
sitting
by
marshman
talking
with
two
other
ladies
but
ellen
smiled
presently
as
she
caught
her
eye
from
the
far
end
of
the
room
and
got
a
little
nod
of
recognition
john
came
up
just
then
to
set
down
his
and
asked
her
what
she
was
smiling
at
that
city
manners
said
william
gillespie
to
laugh
at
what
going
on
i
have
no
doubt
we
shall
all
follow
the
example
said
john
humphreys
gravely
if
the
young
gentleman
will
try
to
give
us
a
smile
the
young
gentleman
had
just
accommodated
himself
with
an
outrageously
large
mouthful
of
bread
and
sweetmeats
and
if
ever
so
compliance
with
the
request
was
impossible
none
of
the
rest
however
not
even
his
sister
could
keep
their
countenances
for
the
eye
of
the
speaker
had
pointed
and
sharpened
his
words
and
william
very
red
in
the
face
was
understood
to
mumble
as
soon
as
mumbling
was
possible
that
he
would
laugh
unless
he
had
a
mind
to
and
a
threat
to
do
something
to
his
tormentor
only
not
eat
me
said
john
with
a
shade
of
expression
in
his
look
and
tone
which
overcame
the
whole
party
himself
and
poor
william
alone
retaining
entire
gravity
what
all
this
what
all
this
what
all
this
laughing
about
said
old
marshman
looking
up
this
young
gentleman
sir
said
john
has
been
endeavouring
with
a
mouthful
of
arguments
to
prove
to
us
the
inferiority
of
city
manners
to
those
learned
in
the
country
will
said
the
old
gentleman
glancing
doubtfully
at
discomfited
face
then
added
sternly
i
do
care
where
your
manners
were
learnt
sir
but
i
advise
you
to
be
very
particular
as
to
the
sort
you
bring
with
you
here
now
sophia
let
us
have
some
music
he
set
the
children
and
as
ellen
did
not
know
how
he
kept
her
by
him
and
kept
her
very
much
amused
too
in
his
own
way
then
he
would
have
her
join
in
the
dancing
and
bade
ellen
chauncey
give
her
lessons
there
was
a
little
backwardness
at
first
and
then
ellen
was
jumping
away
with
the
rest
and
thinking
it
perfectly
delightful
as
miss
sophia
piano
rattled
out
merry
jigs
and
tunes
and
little
feet
flew
over
the
floor
as
light
as
the
hearts
they
belonged
to
at
eight
the
young
ones
were
dismissed
and
bade
to
their
elders
and
pleased
with
the
kind
kiss
marshman
had
given
her
as
well
as
her
little
granddaughter
ellen
went
off
to
bed
very
happy
the
room
to
which
her
companion
led
her
was
the
very
picture
of
comfort
it
was
not
too
large
furnished
with
plain
furniture
and
lighted
and
warmed
by
a
cheerful
wood
fire
the
very
old
andirons
that
stretched
themselves
out
upon
the
hearth
with
such
a
look
of
being
at
home
seemed
to
say
you
have
come
to
the
right
place
for
comfort
a
little
dark
mahogany
bookcase
in
one
place
an
odd
of
the
same
stuff
in
another
and
opposite
the
fire
an
high
with
its
handsome
marseilles
quilt
and
ample
pillows
looked
very
tempting
between
this
and
the
far
side
of
the
room
in
the
corner
another
bed
was
spread
on
the
floor
this
is
aunt
sophia
room
said
little
ellen
chauncey
this
is
where
you
are
to
sleep
and
where
will
alice
be
said
the
other
ellen
oh
she
sleep
here
in
this
bed
with
aunt
sophia
that
is
because
the
house
is
so
full
you
know
and
here
is
your
bed
here
on
the
floor
oh
delicious
i
wish
i
was
going
to
sleep
here
do
you
love
to
sleep
on
the
floor
i
do
i
think
it
fun
anybody
might
have
thought
it
fun
to
sleep
on
that
bed
for
instead
of
a
bedstead
it
was
luxuriously
piled
on
mattresses
the
two
children
sat
down
together
on
the
foot
of
it
this
is
aunt
sophia
room
continued
little
ellen
and
next
to
it
out
of
that
door
is
our
and
next
to
that
is
where
mamma
and
i
sleep
do
you
undress
and
dress
yourself
to
be
sure
i
do
said
ellen
always
so
do
i
but
marianne
gillespie
wo
even
put
on
her
shoes
and
stockings
for
herself
who
does
it
then
said
ellen
why
lester
aunt
matilda
maid
mamma
sent
away
her
maid
when
we
came
here
and
she
says
if
she
had
fifty
she
would
like
me
to
do
everything
i
can
for
myself
i
should
think
it
was
pleasant
to
have
any
one
put
on
one
shoes
and
stockings
for
you
should
you
no
indeed
said
ellen
then
you
live
here
all
the
time
oh
yes
ever
since
papa
did
come
back
from
that
long
voyage
we
live
here
since
then
is
he
coming
back
soon
no
said
little
ellen
gravely
he
never
came
back
he
never
will
come
back
any
more
ellen
was
sorry
she
had
asked
and
both
children
were
silent
for
a
minute
i
tell
you
what
said
little
ellen
jumping
up
mamma
said
we
must
sit
up
too
long
talking
so
i
run
and
get
my
things
and
bring
here
and
we
can
undress
together
wo
that
be
a
nice
way
chapter
xxviii
he
that
loses
anything
and
gets
wisdom
by
it
is
a
gainer
by
the
loss
left
alone
in
the
strange
room
with
the
flickering
fire
how
quickly
ellen
thoughts
left
ventnor
and
flew
over
the
sea
they
often
travelled
that
road
it
is
true
but
now
perhaps
the
very
home
look
of
everything
where
yet
was
not
at
home
might
have
sent
them
there
was
a
bitter
twinge
or
two
and
for
a
minute
ellen
head
drooped
will
be
christmas
eve
last
christmas
eve
oh
mamma
little
ellen
chauncey
soon
came
back
and
sitting
down
beside
her
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
began
the
business
of
undressing
do
you
love
christmas
time
said
she
i
think
it
the
pleasantest
in
all
the
year
we
always
have
a
house
full
of
people
and
such
fine
times
but
then
in
summer
i
think
the
pleasantest
i
they
all
pleasant
do
you
hang
up
your
stocking
no
said
ellen
do
you
why
i
always
did
ever
since
i
can
remember
i
used
to
think
when
i
was
a
little
girl
you
know
said
she
laughing
i
used
to
think
that
santa
claus
came
down
the
chimney
and
i
used
to
hang
up
my
stocking
as
near
the
fireplace
as
i
could
but
i
know
better
than
that
now
i
do
care
where
i
hang
it
you
know
who
santa
claus
is
do
you
he
nobody
said
ellen
oh
yes
he
is
he
a
great
many
people
he
whoever
gives
you
anything
santa
claus
is
mamma
and
grandpapa
and
grandmamma
and
aunt
sophia
and
aunt
matilda
and
i
thought
i
should
have
had
uncle
george
too
this
christmas
but
he
could
come
uncle
howard
never
gives
me
anything
i
am
sorry
uncle
george
could
come
i
like
him
the
best
of
all
my
uncles
i
never
had
anybody
but
mamma
to
give
me
presents
said
ellen
and
she
never
gave
me
much
more
at
christmas
than
at
other
times
i
used
to
have
presents
from
mamma
and
grandpapa
too
both
christmas
and
new
year
but
now
i
have
grown
so
old
mamma
only
gives
me
something
christmas
and
grandpapa
only
new
year
it
would
be
too
much
you
know
for
me
to
have
both
when
my
presents
are
so
big
i
do
believe
a
stocking
would
hold
much
longer
but
oh
we
got
such
a
fine
plan
in
our
heads
said
little
ellen
lowering
her
voice
and
speaking
with
open
eyes
and
great
energy
are
going
to
make
presents
this
year
we
children
wo
it
be
fine
we
are
going
to
make
what
we
like
for
anybody
we
choose
and
let
nobody
know
anything
about
it
and
then
new
year
morning
you
know
when
the
things
are
all
under
the
napkins
we
will
give
ours
to
somebody
to
put
where
they
belong
and
nobody
will
know
anything
about
them
till
they
see
them
there
wo
it
be
fine
so
glad
you
are
here
for
i
want
you
to
tell
me
what
i
shall
make
who
is
it
for
said
ellen
oh
mamma
you
know
i
ca
make
for
everybody
so
i
think
i
had
rather
it
should
be
for
mamma
i
of
making
her
a
with
white
backs
and
getting
gilbert
gillespie
to
paint
them
he
can
paint
beautifully
and
having
her
name
and
something
else
written
very
nicely
inside
how
do
you
think
that
would
do
i
should
think
it
would
do
very
nicely
said
ellen
very
nicely
indeed
i
wish
uncle
george
was
at
home
though
to
write
it
for
me
he
writes
so
beautifully
i
ca
do
it
well
enough
i
am
afraid
i
ca
either
said
ellen
perhaps
somebody
else
can
i
do
know
who
aunt
sophia
scribbles
and
scratches
and
besides
i
do
want
her
to
know
anything
about
it
but
there
another
thing
i
do
know
how
to
fix
and
that
the
edges
of
the
leaves
the
leaves
for
the
needles
they
must
be
fixed
somehow
i
can
show
you
how
to
do
that
said
ellen
brightening
mamma
had
a
needle
book
that
was
given
to
her
that
had
the
edges
beautifully
fixed
and
i
wanted
to
know
how
it
was
done
and
she
showed
me
i
show
you
that
it
takes
a
good
while
but
that
no
matter
oh
thank
you
how
nice
that
is
oh
no
that
no
matter
and
then
it
will
do
very
well
wo
it
now
if
i
can
only
catch
gilbert
in
a
he
is
my
cousin
he
marianne
cousin
that
big
boy
you
saw
downstairs
he
so
big
he
wo
have
anything
to
say
to
me
sometimes
but
i
guess
i
get
him
to
do
this
do
you
want
to
make
something
for
somebody
ellen
had
one
or
two
feverish
thoughts
on
this
subject
since
the
beginning
of
the
conversation
but
she
only
said
it
no
matter
you
know
i
have
got
anything
here
and
besides
i
shall
not
be
here
till
new
year
not
here
till
new
year
yes
you
shall
said
little
ellen
throwing
herself
upon
her
neck
indeed
you
are
going
away
before
that
i
you
are
i
heard
grandmamma
and
aunt
sophia
talking
about
it
say
you
will
stay
here
till
new
year
do
i
should
like
to
very
much
indeed
said
ellen
if
alice
does
in
the
midst
of
kisses
with
which
her
little
companion
rewarded
this
speech
somebody
close
by
said
pleasantly
what
time
of
night
do
you
suppose
it
is
the
girls
started
there
was
chauncey
oh
mamma
exclaimed
her
little
daughter
springing
to
her
feet
i
hope
you
have
heard
what
we
have
been
talking
about
not
a
word
said
chauncey
smiling
but
as
will
be
long
enough
to
talk
in
had
you
better
go
to
bed
now
her
daughter
obeyed
her
immediately
after
one
more
hug
to
ellen
and
telling
her
she
was
glad
she
had
come
chauncey
stayed
to
see
ellen
in
bed
and
press
one
kind
motherly
kiss
upon
her
face
so
tenderly
that
ellen
eyes
were
moistened
as
she
withdrew
but
in
her
dreams
that
night
the
rosy
sweet
face
blue
eyes
and
little
plump
figure
of
ellen
chauncey
played
the
greatest
part
she
slept
till
alice
was
obliged
to
waken
her
the
next
morning
and
then
got
up
with
her
head
in
a
charming
confusion
of
pleasures
past
and
pleasures
to
come
things
known
and
unknown
to
be
made
for
new
year
presents
linen
collars
and
painted
and
no
sooner
was
breakfast
over
than
she
was
showing
and
explaining
to
ellen
chauncey
a
particularly
splendid
and
mysterious
way
of
embroidering
the
edges
of
leaves
deep
in
this
they
were
still
an
hour
afterwards
and
in
the
comparative
merits
of
purple
and
when
a
little
hubbub
arose
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
on
the
arrival
of
a
ellen
chauncey
looked
up
from
her
work
then
dropped
it
exclaiming
there
she
is
now
for
the
bag
and
pulled
ellen
along
with
her
towards
the
party
a
young
lady
was
in
the
midst
of
it
talking
so
fast
that
she
had
not
time
to
take
off
her
cloak
and
bonnet
as
her
eye
met
ellen
however
she
came
to
a
sudden
pause
it
was
margaret
dunscombe
face
certainly
showed
no
pleasure
margaret
darkened
with
a
very
disagreeable
surprise
my
goodness
ellen
montgomery
how
on
earth
did
you
get
said
margaret
do
you
know
her
asked
one
of
the
girls
as
the
two
ellens
went
off
after
aunt
sophia
do
i
know
her
yes
just
enough
exactly
how
did
she
get
here
miss
humphreys
brought
her
who
miss
humphreys
hush
said
marianne
lowering
her
tone
that
her
brother
in
the
window
who
brother
hers
or
miss
humphreys
miss
humphreys
did
you
never
see
her
she
is
here
or
has
been
here
a
great
deal
of
the
time
grandma
calls
her
her
fourth
daughter
and
she
is
just
as
much
at
home
as
if
she
was
and
she
brought
her
here
and
she
at
home
too
i
suppose
well
it
no
business
of
mine
what
do
you
know
of
her
oh
enough
that
just
it
do
want
to
know
any
more
well
you
need
but
what
the
matter
with
her
oh
i
do
know
i
tell
you
some
other
time
she
a
conceited
little
piece
we
had
the
care
of
her
coming
up
the
river
that
how
i
come
to
know
about
her
ma
said
it
was
the
last
child
she
would
be
bothered
with
in
that
way
presently
the
two
girls
came
back
bringing
word
to
clear
the
table
for
aunt
sophia
was
coming
with
the
moroccos
as
soon
as
she
came
ellen
chauncey
sprang
to
her
neck
and
whispered
an
earnest
question
certainly
aunt
sophia
said
as
she
poured
out
the
contents
of
the
bag
and
her
little
niece
delightedly
told
ellen
was
to
have
her
share
as
well
as
the
rest
the
table
was
now
strewn
with
pieces
of
morocco
of
all
sizes
and
colours
which
were
hastily
turned
over
and
examined
with
eager
hands
and
sparkling
eyes
some
were
mere
scraps
to
be
sure
but
others
showed
a
breadth
and
length
of
beauty
which
was
declared
to
be
and
fine
and
one
beautiful
large
piece
of
blue
morocco
in
particular
was
made
up
in
imagination
by
two
or
three
of
the
party
in
as
many
different
ways
marianne
wanted
it
for
a
margaret
declared
she
could
make
a
lovely
reticule
with
it
and
ellen
could
not
help
thinking
it
would
make
a
very
pretty
such
a
one
as
she
had
seen
in
the
possession
of
one
of
the
girls
and
longed
to
make
for
alice
well
what
to
be
done
now
said
miss
sophia
or
am
i
not
to
know
oh
you
not
to
know
you
not
to
know
aunt
sophia
cried
the
girls
you
must
ask
i
tell
you
what
they
are
going
to
do
with
said
george
walsh
coming
up
to
her
with
a
mischievous
face
and
adding
in
a
loud
whisper
shielding
his
mouth
with
his
hand
they
going
to
make
pr
he
was
laid
hold
of
forcibly
by
the
whole
party
screaming
and
laughing
and
stopped
short
from
finishing
his
speech
well
then
i
take
my
departure
said
miss
sophia
but
how
will
you
manage
to
divide
all
these
scraps
suppose
we
were
to
put
them
in
the
bag
again
and
you
hold
the
bag
and
we
were
to
draw
them
out
without
looking
said
ellen
chauncey
as
we
used
to
do
with
the
as
no
better
plan
was
thought
of
this
was
agreed
upon
and
little
ellen
shutting
up
her
eyes
very
tight
stuck
in
her
hand
and
pulled
out
a
little
bit
of
green
morocco
about
the
size
of
a
dollar
ellen
montgomery
came
next
then
margaret
then
marianne
then
their
mutual
friend
isabel
hawthorn
each
had
to
take
her
turn
a
great
many
times
and
at
the
end
of
the
drawing
the
pieces
were
found
to
be
pretty
equally
divided
among
the
party
with
the
exception
of
ellen
who
besides
several
other
good
pieces
had
drawn
the
famous
blue
that
will
do
very
nicely
said
little
ellen
chauncey
i
am
glad
you
have
got
that
ellen
now
aunt
sophy
one
thing
more
you
know
the
silks
and
ribbons
you
promised
us
bless
me
i
have
done
yet
eh
well
you
shall
have
them
but
we
are
all
going
out
to
walk
now
i
give
them
to
you
this
afternoon
come
put
these
away
and
get
on
your
bonnets
and
cloaks
a
hard
measure
but
it
was
done
after
the
walk
came
dinner
after
dinner
aunt
sophia
had
to
be
found
and
waited
on
till
she
had
fairly
sought
out
and
delivered
to
their
hands
the
bundles
of
silks
and
satins
it
gave
great
satisfaction
but
how
shall
we
do
about
dividing
these
said
little
ellen
shall
we
draw
lots
again
no
ellen
said
marianne
that
wo
do
because
we
might
every
one
get
just
the
things
we
do
not
want
i
want
one
colour
or
stuff
to
go
with
my
morocco
and
you
want
another
to
go
with
yours
and
you
might
get
mine
and
i
might
get
yours
we
had
best
each
choose
in
turn
what
we
like
beginning
at
isabel
very
well
said
little
ellen
i
agreed
anything
for
a
quiet
life
said
george
walsh
but
this
business
of
choosing
was
found
to
be
very
long
and
very
difficult
each
one
was
so
fearful
of
not
taking
the
exact
piece
she
wanted
most
the
elder
members
of
the
family
began
to
gather
for
dinner
and
several
came
and
stood
round
the
table
where
the
children
were
little
noticed
by
them
they
were
so
wrapped
up
in
silks
and
satins
ellen
seemed
the
least
interested
person
at
the
table
and
had
made
her
selections
with
the
least
delay
and
difficulty
and
now
as
it
was
not
her
turn
sat
very
soberly
looking
on
with
her
head
resting
on
her
hand
i
declare
it
too
vexatious
said
margaret
dunscombe
here
i
got
this
beautiful
piece
of
blue
satin
and
ca
do
anything
with
it
it
just
matches
that
blue
morocco
it
a
perfect
match
i
could
have
made
a
splendid
thing
of
it
and
i
have
got
some
cord
and
tassels
that
would
just
do
i
declare
it
too
bad
ellen
colour
changed
well
choose
margaret
said
marianne
i
do
know
what
to
choose
that
the
thing
what
can
one
do
with
red
and
purple
morocco
and
blue
satin
i
might
as
well
give
up
i
a
great
notion
to
take
this
piece
of
yellow
satin
and
dress
up
a
turkish
doll
to
frighten
the
next
young
one
i
meet
with
i
wish
you
would
margaret
and
give
it
to
me
when
it
done
cried
little
ellen
chauncey
tai
made
yet
said
the
other
dryly
ellen
colour
had
changed
and
changed
her
hand
twitched
nervously
and
she
glanced
uneasily
from
margaret
store
of
finery
to
her
own
come
choose
margaret
said
ellen
chauncey
i
dare
say
ellen
wants
the
blue
morocco
as
much
as
you
do
no
i
do
said
ellen
abruptly
throwing
it
over
the
table
to
her
take
it
margaret
you
may
have
it
what
do
you
mean
said
the
other
astounded
i
mean
you
may
have
it
said
ellen
i
do
want
it
well
i
tell
you
what
said
the
other
i
give
you
yellow
satin
for
it
or
some
of
my
red
morocco
no
i
had
rather
not
repeated
ellen
i
do
want
it
you
may
have
it
very
generously
done
remarked
miss
sophia
i
hope
you
all
take
a
lesson
in
the
art
of
being
obliging
quite
a
noble
little
girl
said
gillespie
ellen
crimsoned
no
i
not
indeed
she
said
looking
at
them
with
eyes
that
were
filling
fast
please
do
say
so
i
do
deserve
it
i
shall
say
what
i
think
my
dear
said
gillespie
smiling
but
i
glad
you
add
the
grace
of
modesty
to
that
of
generosity
it
is
the
more
uncommon
of
the
two
i
am
not
modest
i
am
not
generous
you
must
say
so
cried
ellen
she
struggled
the
blood
rushed
to
the
surface
suffusing
every
particle
of
skin
that
could
be
seen
then
left
it
as
with
eyes
cast
down
she
went
on
i
do
deserve
to
be
praised
it
was
more
margaret
than
mine
i
ought
to
have
kept
it
at
all
for
i
saw
a
little
bit
when
i
put
my
hand
in
i
did
mean
to
but
i
did
raising
her
eyes
hastily
to
alice
face
they
met
those
of
john
who
was
standing
behind
her
she
had
not
counted
upon
him
for
one
of
her
listeners
she
knew
gillespie
chauncey
miss
sophia
and
alice
had
heard
her
but
this
was
the
one
drop
too
much
her
head
sank
she
covered
her
face
a
moment
and
then
made
her
escape
out
of
the
room
before
even
ellen
could
follow
her
there
was
a
moment
silence
alice
seemed
to
have
some
difficulty
not
to
follow
ellen
example
margaret
pouted
chauncey
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
her
little
daughter
seemed
divided
between
doubt
and
dismay
her
first
move
however
was
to
run
off
in
pursuit
of
ellen
alice
went
after
her
here
a
beautiful
example
of
honour
and
honesty
for
you
said
margaret
dunscombe
at
length
i
think
it
is
said
john
quietly
an
uncommon
instance
said
chauncey
i
glad
everybody
thinks
so
said
margaret
sullenly
i
hope
i
copy
it
that
all
i
think
you
are
in
no
danger
said
john
again
very
well
said
margaret
who
between
her
desire
of
speaking
and
her
desire
of
concealing
her
vexation
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
herself
everybody
must
judge
for
himself
i
suppose
i
got
enough
of
her
for
my
part
where
did
you
ever
see
her
before
said
isabel
hawthorn
oh
she
came
up
the
river
with
us
mamma
had
to
take
care
of
her
she
was
with
us
two
days
and
did
you
like
her
no
i
guess
i
did
she
was
a
perfect
plague
all
the
day
on
board
the
steamboat
she
scarcely
came
near
us
we
could
pretend
to
keep
sight
of
her
mamma
had
to
send
her
maid
out
to
look
after
her
i
know
how
many
times
she
scraped
acquaintance
with
some
strange
man
on
board
and
liked
his
company
better
than
ours
for
she
stayed
with
him
the
whole
blessed
day
waking
and
sleeping
of
course
mamma
did
like
it
at
all
she
did
go
a
single
meal
with
us
you
know
of
course
that
was
proper
behaviour
no
indeed
said
isabel
i
suppose
said
john
coolly
she
chose
the
society
she
thought
the
pleasantest
probably
miss
margaret
politeness
was
more
than
she
had
been
accustomed
to
margaret
coloured
not
quite
knowing
what
to
make
of
the
speaker
or
his
speech
it
would
take
much
to
make
me
believe
said
gentle
chauncey
that
a
child
of
such
refined
and
delicate
feeling
as
that
little
girl
evidently
has
could
take
pleasure
in
improper
company
margaret
had
a
reply
at
her
tongue
end
but
she
had
also
an
uneasy
feeling
that
there
were
eyes
not
far
off
too
keen
of
sight
to
be
baffled
she
kept
silence
till
the
group
dispersed
and
she
had
an
opportunity
of
whispering
in
marianne
ear
that
was
the
very
most
disagreeable
man
she
had
ever
seen
in
her
life
what
a
singular
fancy
you
have
taken
to
this
little
pet
of
alice
john
said
marshman
youngest
daughter
you
quite
surprise
me
did
you
think
me
a
misanthrope
miss
sophia
oh
no
not
at
all
but
i
always
had
a
notion
you
would
not
be
easily
pleased
in
the
choice
of
favourites
when
a
simple
intelligent
child
of
twelve
or
thirteen
is
a
common
character
then
i
will
allow
that
i
am
easily
pleased
twelve
or
thirteen
said
miss
sophia
what
are
you
thinking
about
alice
says
she
is
only
ten
or
eleven
in
years
perhaps
how
gravely
you
take
me
up
said
the
young
lady
laughing
my
dear
john
years
perhaps
you
may
call
yourself
twenty
but
in
everything
else
you
might
much
better
pass
for
thirty
or
forty
as
they
were
called
to
dinner
alice
and
ellen
chauncey
came
back
the
former
looking
a
little
serious
the
latter
crying
and
wishing
aloud
that
all
the
moroccos
had
been
in
the
fire
they
had
not
been
able
to
find
ellen
neither
was
she
in
the
when
they
returned
to
it
after
dinner
and
a
second
search
was
made
in
vain
john
went
to
the
library
which
was
separate
from
the
other
rooms
thinking
she
might
have
chosen
that
for
a
she
was
not
there
but
the
pleasant
light
of
the
room
where
only
the
fire
was
burning
invited
a
stay
he
sat
down
in
the
deep
window
and
was
musingly
looking
out
into
the
moonlight
when
the
door
softly
opened
and
ellen
came
in
she
stole
in
noiselessly
so
that
he
did
not
hear
her
and
thought
the
room
empty
till
in
passing
slowly
down
toward
the
fire
she
came
upon
him
in
the
window
her
start
first
let
him
know
she
was
there
she
would
have
run
but
one
of
her
hands
was
caught
and
she
could
not
get
it
away
running
away
from
your
brother
ellie
said
he
kindly
what
is
the
matter
ellen
shrunk
from
meeting
his
eye
and
was
silent
i
know
all
ellie
said
he
still
very
kindly
i
have
seen
all
why
do
you
shun
me
ellen
said
nothing
the
big
tears
began
to
run
down
her
face
and
frock
you
are
taking
this
matter
too
hardly
dear
ellen
he
said
drawing
her
close
to
him
you
did
wrong
but
you
have
done
all
you
could
to
repair
the
wrong
neither
man
nor
woman
can
do
more
than
that
but
though
encouraged
by
his
manner
the
tears
flowed
faster
than
ever
where
have
you
been
alice
was
looking
for
you
and
little
ellen
chauncey
was
in
great
trouble
i
do
know
what
dreadful
thing
she
thought
you
had
done
with
yourself
come
lift
up
your
head
and
let
me
see
you
smile
again
ellen
lifted
her
head
but
could
not
her
eyes
though
she
tried
to
smile
i
want
to
talk
to
you
a
little
about
this
said
he
you
know
you
gave
me
leave
to
be
your
brother
will
you
let
me
ask
you
a
question
or
two
oh
yes
whatever
you
please
ellen
said
then
sit
down
here
said
he
making
room
for
her
on
the
wide
but
still
keeping
hold
of
her
hand
and
speaking
very
gently
you
said
you
saw
when
you
took
the
morocco
i
do
quite
understand
how
was
it
why
said
ellen
we
were
not
to
look
and
we
had
gone
three
times
round
and
nobody
had
got
that
large
piece
yet
and
we
all
wanted
it
and
i
did
not
mean
to
look
at
all
but
i
do
know
how
it
was
just
before
i
shut
my
eyes
i
happened
to
see
the
corner
of
it
sticking
up
and
then
i
took
it
with
your
eyes
open
no
no
with
them
shut
and
i
had
scarcely
got
it
when
i
was
sorry
for
it
and
wished
it
back
you
will
wonder
at
me
perhaps
ellie
said
john
but
i
am
not
very
sorry
this
has
happened
you
are
no
worse
than
before
it
has
only
made
you
see
what
you
are
very
very
weak
quite
unable
to
keep
yourself
right
without
constant
help
sudden
temptation
was
too
much
for
you
so
it
has
many
a
time
been
for
me
and
so
it
has
happened
to
the
best
men
on
earth
i
suppose
if
you
had
had
a
minute
time
to
think
you
would
not
have
done
as
you
did
no
indeed
said
ellen
i
was
sorry
a
minute
after
and
i
dare
say
the
thought
of
it
weighed
upon
your
mind
ever
since
oh
yes
said
ellen
it
was
out
of
my
head
a
minute
the
whole
day
then
let
it
make
you
very
humble
dear
ellie
and
let
it
make
you
in
future
keep
close
to
our
dear
saviour
without
whose
help
we
can
not
stand
a
moment
ellen
sobbed
and
he
allowed
her
to
do
so
for
a
few
minutes
then
said
but
you
have
not
been
thinking
much
about
him
ellie
the
sobs
ceased
he
saw
his
words
had
taken
hold
is
it
right
he
said
softly
that
we
should
be
more
troubled
about
what
people
will
think
of
us
than
for
having
displeased
or
dishonoured
him
ellen
now
looked
up
and
in
her
look
was
all
the
answer
he
wished
you
understand
me
i
see
said
he
be
humbled
in
the
dust
before
him
the
more
the
better
but
whenever
we
are
greatly
concerned
for
our
own
sakes
about
other
people
opinion
we
may
be
sure
we
are
thinking
too
little
of
god
and
what
will
please
him
i
am
very
sorry
said
poor
ellen
from
whose
eyes
the
tears
began
to
drop
again
i
am
very
wrong
but
i
could
bear
to
think
what
alice
would
think
and
you
and
all
of
them
here
alice
to
speak
for
herself
said
john
as
alice
came
up
with
a
quick
step
and
knelt
down
before
her
ellen
sprang
to
her
neck
and
they
held
each
other
very
fast
indeed
john
walked
up
and
down
the
room
presently
he
stopped
before
them
all
well
again
said
alice
and
we
going
in
to
tea
he
smiled
and
held
out
his
hand
which
ellen
took
but
he
would
not
leave
the
library
declaring
they
had
a
quarter
of
an
hour
still
so
they
sauntered
up
and
down
the
long
room
talking
of
different
things
so
pleasantly
that
ellen
near
forgot
her
troubles
then
came
in
miss
sophia
to
find
them
and
then
marshman
and
marianne
to
call
them
to
tea
so
the
going
into
the
was
not
half
so
bad
as
ellen
thought
it
would
be
she
behaved
very
well
her
face
was
touchingly
humble
that
night
and
all
the
evening
she
kept
fast
by
either
alice
or
john
without
budging
an
inch
and
as
little
ellen
chauncey
and
her
cousin
george
walsh
chose
to
be
where
she
was
the
young
party
was
quite
divided
and
not
the
least
merry
portion
of
it
was
that
mixed
with
the
older
people
little
ellen
was
half
beside
herself
with
spirits
the
secret
of
which
perhaps
was
the
fact
which
she
several
times
in
the
course
of
the
evening
whispered
to
ellen
as
a
great
piece
of
news
that
it
was
christmas
eve
chapter
xxix
as
bees
flee
hame
wi
lades
o
treasure
the
minutes
winged
their
way
wi
pleasure
kings
may
be
blest
but
were
glorious
all
the
ills
o
life
victorious
burns
christmas
morning
was
dawning
grey
but
it
was
still
far
from
broad
daylight
when
ellen
was
awakened
she
found
little
ellen
chauncey
pulling
and
pushing
at
her
shoulders
and
whispering
ellen
ellen
in
a
tone
that
showed
a
great
fear
of
waking
somebody
up
there
she
was
in
and
and
barefooted
too
with
a
face
brimful
of
excitement
and
as
wide
awake
as
possible
ellen
roused
herself
in
no
little
surprise
and
asked
what
the
matter
was
i
am
going
to
look
at
my
stocking
whispered
her
visitor
do
you
want
to
get
up
and
come
with
me
it
just
here
in
the
other
room
come
do
make
any
noise
but
what
if
you
should
find
nothing
in
it
said
ellen
laughingly
as
she
bounded
out
of
bed
ah
but
i
shall
i
know
i
always
do
never
fear
hush
step
ever
so
softly
i
do
want
to
wake
anybody
it
hardly
light
enough
for
you
to
see
whispered
ellen
as
the
two
little
barefooted
white
figures
glided
out
of
the
room
oh
yes
it
is
that
all
the
fun
hush
do
make
a
bit
of
noise
i
know
where
it
hangs
mamma
always
puts
it
at
the
back
of
her
big
easy
chair
come
this
way
here
it
is
oh
ellen
there
two
of
one
for
you
there
one
for
you
in
a
tumult
of
delight
one
ellen
capered
about
the
floor
on
the
tips
of
her
little
bare
toes
while
the
other
not
less
happy
stood
still
for
pleasure
the
dancer
finished
by
hugging
and
kissing
her
with
all
her
heart
declaring
she
was
so
glad
she
did
know
what
to
do
but
how
shall
we
know
which
is
which
perhaps
they
are
both
alike
said
ellen
no
at
any
rate
one
for
me
and
for
you
stop
here
are
pieces
of
paper
with
our
names
on
i
guess
let
turn
the
chair
a
little
bit
to
the
light
there
yes
ellen
there
that
yours
my
name
does
begin
with
an
m
and
this
is
mine
another
caper
round
the
room
and
then
she
brought
up
in
front
of
the
chair
where
ellen
was
still
standing
i
wonder
what
in
she
said
i
want
to
look
and
i
want
to
come
you
begin
but
that
no
stocking
of
mine
said
ellen
a
smile
gradually
breaking
upon
her
sober
little
face
my
leg
never
was
as
big
as
that
stuffed
is
it
said
ellen
chauncey
oh
do
make
haste
and
see
what
is
in
yours
i
want
to
know
so
i
do
know
what
to
do
well
will
you
take
out
of
yours
as
fast
as
i
take
out
of
mine
well
oh
mysterious
delight
and
delightful
mystery
of
the
stuffed
stocking
ellen
trembling
fingers
sought
the
top
and
then
very
suddenly
left
it
i
ca
think
what
it
is
said
she
laughing
it
feels
so
funny
oh
never
mind
make
haste
said
ellen
chauncey
it
wo
hurt
you

the
voice
of

from

back
to
bed
both
of
you

year
we

have
you
both
sick
in
bed
as
it
is
i
suppose
you
will
go
scot
free
laughing
and
rosy
with
pleasure
they
came
back
and
got
into
bed
together
and
for
an
hour
afterwards
the
two
kept
up
a
most
animated
conversation
intermixed
with
long
chuckles
and
bursts
of
merriment
and
whispered
communications
of
immense
importance
the
arrangement
of
the
painted
was
entirely
decided
upon
in
this
consultation
also
two
or
three
other
matters
and
the
two
children
seemed
to
have
already
lived
a
day
since
daybreak
by
the
time
they
came
down
to
breakfast
after
breakfast
ellen
applied
secretly
to
alice
to
know
if
she
could
write
beautifully
she
exceedingly
wanted
something
done
i
should
not
like
to
venture
ellie
if
it
must
be
so
superfine
but
john
can
do
it
for
you
can
he
do
you
think
he
would
i
am
sure
he
will
if
you
ask
him
but
i
do
like
to
ask
him
said
ellen
casting
a
doubtful
glance
at
the
window
nonsense
he
only
reading
the
newspaper
you
wo
disturb
him
well
you
wo
say
anything
about
it
certainly
not
ellen
accordingly
went
near
and
said
gently
humphreys
but
he
did
not
seem
to
hear
her
mr
humphreys
a
little
louder
he
has
not
arrived
yet
said
john
looking
round
gravely
he
spoke
so
gravely
that
ellen
could
not
tell
whether
he
was
joking
or
serious
her
face
of
extreme
perplexity
was
too
much
for
his
command
of
countenance
whom
do
you
want
to
speak
to
said
he
smiling
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
sir
said
ellen
if
you
are
not
now
too
busy
is
always
busy
said
he
shaking
his
head
but
can
attend
to
you
at
any
time
and
will
do
for
you
whatever
you
please
to
ask
him
then
john
said
ellen
laughing
if
you
please
i
wanted
to
ask
you
to
do
something
for
me
very
much
indeed
if
you
are
not
too
busy
alice
said
i
should
disturb
you
not
at
all
i
been
long
enough
over
this
stupid
newspaper
what
is
it
i
want
you
if
you
will
be
so
good
said
ellen
to
write
a
little
bit
for
me
on
something
very
beautifully
beautifully
well
come
to
the
library
we
will
see
but
it
is
a
great
secret
said
ellen
you
wo
tell
anybody
tortures
sha
draw
it
from
me
when
i
know
what
it
is
said
he
with
one
of
his
comical
looks
in
high
glee
ellen
ran
for
the
pieces
of
bristol
board
which
were
to
form
the
backs
of
the
and
brought
them
to
the
library
and
explained
how
room
was
to
be
left
in
the
middle
of
each
for
a
painting
a
rose
on
one
a
butterfly
on
the
other
the
writing
to
be
as
elegant
as
possible
above
beneath
and
roundabout
as
the
fancy
of
the
writer
should
choose
well
what
is
to
be
inscribed
on
this
most
original
of
said
john
as
he
carefully
mended
his
pen
stop
said
ellen
i
tell
you
in
a
minute
on
this
one
the
front
you
know
is
to
go
my
dear
mother
many
happy
new
years
and
on
this
side
her
dear
little
daughter
ellen
chauncey
you
know
she
added
chauncey
is
to
know
anything
about
it
till
new
year
day
nor
anybody
else
trust
me
said
john
if
i
am
asked
any
questions
they
shall
find
me
as
obscure
as
an
oracle
what
is
an
oracle
sir
why
said
john
smiling
this
pen
wo
do
yet
the
old
heathens
believed
there
were
certain
spots
of
earth
to
which
some
of
their
gods
had
more
favour
than
to
others
and
where
they
would
permit
mortals
to
come
nearer
to
them
and
would
even
deign
to
answer
their
questions
and
they
did
said
ellen
did
they
what
did
they
answer
their
questions
did
answer
their
questions
the
oh
to
be
sure
said
ellen
there
were
no
such
gods
but
what
made
people
think
they
answered
them
and
how
could
they
ask
questions
i
suppose
it
was
a
contrivance
of
the
priests
to
increase
their
power
and
wealth
there
was
always
a
temple
built
near
with
priests
and
priestesses
the
questions
were
put
through
them
and
they
would
not
ask
them
except
on
great
occasions
or
for
people
of
consequence
who
could
pay
them
well
by
making
splendid
gifts
to
the
god
but
i
should
think
the
people
would
have
thought
the
priests
or
priestesses
had
made
up
the
answer
themselves
perhaps
they
did
sometimes
but
people
had
not
the
bible
then
and
did
not
know
as
much
as
we
know
it
was
not
unnatural
to
think
the
gods
would
take
care
a
little
for
the
poor
people
that
lived
on
the
earth
besides
there
was
a
good
deal
of
management
and
trickery
about
the
answers
of
the
oracle
that
helped
to
deceive
how
was
it
said
ellen
how
could
they
manage
and
what
was
the
oracle
was
either
the
answer
itself
or
the
god
who
was
supposed
to
give
it
or
the
place
where
it
was
given
and
there
were
different
ways
of
managing
at
one
place
the
priest
hid
himself
in
the
hollow
body
or
among
the
branches
of
an
oak
tree
and
the
people
thought
the
tree
spoke
to
them
sometimes
the
oracle
was
delivered
by
a
woman
who
pretended
to
be
put
into
a
kind
of
fit
tearing
her
hair
and
beating
her
breast
but
suppose
the
oracle
made
a
mistake
what
would
the
people
think
then
the
answers
were
generally
contrived
so
that
they
would
seem
to
come
true
in
any
event
i
do
see
how
they
could
do
that
said
ellen
very
well
just
imagine
that
i
am
an
oracle
and
come
to
me
with
some
question
i
answer
you
but
you
ca
tell
what
going
to
happen
no
matter
you
ask
me
truly
and
i
answer
you
oracularly
that
means
like
an
oracle
i
suppose
said
ellen
well
john
will
alice
be
pleased
with
what
i
am
going
to
give
her
for
her
new
year
she
will
be
pleased
with
what
she
will
receive
on
that
day
ah
but
said
ellen
laughing
that
is
fair
you
have
answered
me
perhaps
somebody
else
will
give
her
something
and
then
she
might
be
pleased
with
that
and
not
with
mine
exactly
but
the
oracle
never
means
to
be
understood
well
i
wo
come
to
you
said
ellen
i
do
like
such
answers
now
for
the
breathlessly
she
looked
on
while
the
skilful
pen
did
its
work
and
her
exclamations
of
delight
and
admiration
when
the
first
cover
was
handed
to
her
were
not
loud
but
deep
it
will
do
then
will
it
now
let
us
see
her
dear
little
daughter
there
now
chauncey
i
suppose
must
be
in
hieroglyphics
in
what
said
ellen
i
mean
written
in
some
difficult
character
yes
said
ellen
but
what
was
that
you
said
hieroglyphics
ellen
added
no
more
though
she
was
not
satisfied
he
looked
up
and
smiled
do
you
want
to
know
what
that
means
yes
if
you
please
said
ellen
the
pen
was
laid
down
while
he
explained
to
a
most
eager
little
listener
even
the
great
business
of
the
moment
was
forgotten
from
hieroglyphics
they
went
to
the
pyramids
and
ellen
had
got
to
the
top
of
one
and
was
enjoying
the
prospect
in
imagination
when
she
suddenly
came
down
to
tell
john
of
her
stuffed
stocking
and
its
contents
the
pen
went
on
again
and
came
to
the
end
of
the
writing
by
the
time
ellen
had
got
to
the
toe
of
the
stocking
was
it
very
strange
they
should
give
me
so
many
things
said
she
people
that
do
know
me
why
no
said
john
smiling
i
can
not
say
i
think
it
was
strange
is
this
all
the
business
you
had
for
my
hands
this
is
all
and
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
mr
john
her
grateful
affectionate
eye
said
much
more
and
he
felt
well
paid
gilbert
was
next
applied
to
to
paint
the
rose
and
the
butterfly
which
finding
so
excellent
a
beginning
made
in
the
work
he
was
very
ready
to
do
the
girls
were
then
free
to
set
about
the
embroidery
of
the
leaves
which
was
by
no
means
the
business
of
an
hour
a
very
happy
christmas
day
was
that
with
their
needles
and
thimbles
and
silk
they
kept
by
themselves
in
a
corner
or
in
the
library
out
of
the
way
and
sweetening
their
talk
with
a
now
and
then
neither
tongues
nor
needles
knew
any
flagging
it
was
wonderful
how
they
found
so
much
to
say
but
there
was
no
lack
ellen
chauncey
especially
was
inexhaustible
several
times
too
that
day
the
cologne
bottle
was
handled
the
gloves
looked
at
and
fondled
the
ball
tried
and
the
new
scissors
extolled
as
just
the
thing
for
their
work
ellen
attempted
to
let
her
companion
into
the
mystery
of
oracles
and
hieroglyphics
but
was
fain
to
give
it
up
little
ellen
showed
a
decided
preference
for
american
not
to
say
ventnor
subjects
where
she
felt
more
at
home
then
came
humphreys
and
ellen
was
glad
both
for
her
own
sake
and
because
she
loved
to
see
alice
pleased
then
came
the
great
merry
christmas
dinner
when
the
girls
had
not
talked
themselves
out
but
tired
themselves
with
working
young
and
old
dined
together
and
the
children
not
set
by
themselves
but
scattered
among
the
people
and
as
ellen
was
nicely
placed
between
alice
and
little
ellen
chauncey
she
enjoyed
it
all
very
much
the
large
long
table
surrounded
with
happy
faces
tones
of
cheerfulness
and
looks
of
kindness
and
lively
talk
the
superb
display
of
plate
and
glass
and
china
the
stately
dinner
and
last
but
not
least
the
there
was
sparkling
wine
too
and
a
great
deal
of
drinking
of
healths
but
ellen
noticed
that
alice
and
her
brother
smilingly
drank
all
theirs
in
water
so
when
old
marshman
called
to
her
to
hold
out
her
glass
she
held
it
out
to
be
sure
and
let
him
fill
it
but
she
lifted
her
tumbler
of
water
to
her
lips
instead
after
making
him
a
very
low
bow
marshman
laughed
at
her
a
great
deal
and
asked
her
if
she
was
a
proselyte
to
the
new
notions
and
ellen
laughed
with
him
without
having
the
least
idea
what
he
meant
and
was
extremely
happy
it
was
very
pleasant
too
when
they
went
into
the
to
take
coffee
the
young
ones
were
permitted
to
have
coffee
as
a
great
favour
old
marshman
had
the
two
little
ones
on
either
side
of
her
and
was
so
kind
and
held
ellen
hand
in
her
own
and
talked
to
her
about
her
mother
till
ellen
loved
her
after
tea
there
was
a
great
call
for
games
and
young
and
old
joined
in
them
they
played
the
old
curiosity
shop
and
ellen
thought
curiosities
could
not
be
matched
they
played
the
old
family
coach
howard
marshman
being
the
manager
and
ellen
laughed
till
she
was
tired
she
was
the
coach
door
and
he
kept
her
opening
and
shutting
and
swinging
and
breaking
it
seemed
all
the
while
though
most
of
the
rest
were
worked
just
as
hard
when
they
were
well
tired
they
sat
down
to
rest
and
hear
music
and
ellen
enjoyed
that
exceedingly
alice
sang
and
gillespie
and
miss
sophia
and
another
lady
and
howard
sometimes
alone
sometimes
three
or
four
or
altogether
at
last
came
ten
and
the
young
ones
were
sent
off
and
from
beginning
to
end
that
had
been
a
christmas
day
of
unbroken
and
unclouded
pleasure
ellen
last
act
was
to
take
another
look
at
her
cologne
bottle
gloves
grapes
and
paper
of
which
were
laid
side
by
side
carefully
in
a
drawer
chapter
xxx
but
though
life
valley
be
a
vale
of
tears
a
brighter
scene
beyond
that
vale
appears
whose
glory
with
a
light
that
never
fades
shoots
between
scattered
rocks
and
opening
shades
cowper
humphreys
was
persuaded
to
stay
over
sunday
at
ventnor
and
it
was
also
settled
that
his
children
should
not
leave
it
till
after
new
year
this
was
less
their
own
wish
than
his
he
said
alice
wanted
the
change
and
he
wished
she
looked
a
little
fatter
besides
the
earnest
pleading
of
the
whole
family
was
not
to
be
denied
ellen
was
very
glad
of
this
though
there
was
one
drawback
to
the
pleasures
of
ventnor
she
could
not
feel
quite
at
home
with
any
of
the
young
people
but
only
ellen
chauncey
and
her
cousin
george
walsh
this
seemed
very
strange
to
her
she
almost
thought
margaret
dunscombe
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
but
she
recollected
she
had
felt
something
of
this
before
margaret
came
she
tried
to
think
nothing
about
it
and
in
truth
it
was
not
able
to
prevent
her
from
being
very
happy
the
breach
however
was
destined
to
grow
wider
about
four
miles
from
ventnor
was
a
large
town
called
randolph
thither
they
drove
to
church
sunday
morning
the
whole
family
but
the
hour
of
dinner
and
the
distance
prevented
any
one
from
going
in
the
afternoon
the
members
of
the
family
were
scattered
in
different
parts
of
the
house
most
in
their
own
rooms
ellen
with
some
difficulty
made
her
escape
from
her
young
companions
whose
manner
of
spending
the
time
did
not
satisfy
her
notions
of
what
was
right
on
that
day
and
went
to
look
in
the
library
for
her
friends
they
were
there
and
alone
alice
half
reclining
on
the
sofa
half
in
her
brother
arms
he
was
reading
or
talking
to
her
there
was
a
book
in
his
hand
is
anything
the
matter
said
ellen
as
she
drew
near
are
you
well
dear
alice
headache
oh
i
am
sorry
oh
i
know
she
darted
away
in
two
minutes
she
was
back
again
with
a
pleased
face
her
bunch
of
grapes
in
one
hand
her
bottle
of
cologne
water
in
the
other
wo

said
she

to
have

headaches
and

i
was
going
to
open
it
till

wanted

john
i
had
a
great
deal
rather
ellen
took
however
as
precious
payment
alice
look
and
kiss
and
then
with
a
delicate
consciousness
that
perhaps
the
brother
and
sister
might
like
to
be
alone
she
left
the
library
she
did
not
know
where
to
go
for
miss
sophia
was
stretched
on
the
bed
in
her
room
and
she
did
not
want
any
company
at
last
with
her
little
bible
she
placed
herself
on
the
old
sofa
in
the
hall
above
stairs
which
was
perfectly
well
warmed
and
for
some
time
she
was
left
there
in
peace
it
was
pleasant
after
all
the
hubbub
of
the
morning
to
have
a
little
quiet
time
that
seemed
like
sunday
and
the
sweet
bible
words
came
as
they
often
now
came
to
ellen
with
a
healing
breath
but
after
or
so
to
her
dismay
she
heard
a
door
open
and
the
whole
gang
of
children
came
trooping
into
the
hall
below
where
they
soon
made
such
a
noise
that
reading
or
thinking
was
out
of
the
question
what
a
bother
it
is
that
one
ca
play
games
on
a
sunday
said
marianne
gillespie
one
play
games
on
a
sunday
answered
her
brother
where
the
odds
it
all
sunday
good
for
think
william
william
sounded
the
shocked
voice
of
little
ellen
chauncey
you
a
real
wicked
boy
well
now
said
william
how
am
i
wicked
now
say
i
should
like
to
know
how
is
it
any
more
wicked
for
us
to
play
games
than
it
is
for
aunt
sophia
to
lie
abed
and
sleep
or
for
uncle
howard
to
read
novels
or
for
grandpa
to
talk
politics
or
for
mother
to
talk
about
the
fashions
there
was
she
and
miss
for
ever
so
long
this
morning
doing
everything
but
a
dress
now
which
is
the
worst
oh
william
william
for
shame
for
shame
said
little
ellen
again
do
hush
ellen
chauncey
will
you
said
marianne
sharply
and
you
had
better
hush
too
william
if
you
know
what
is
good
for
yourself
i
care
whether
it
right
or
wrong
i
do
get
dolefully
tired
with
doing
nothing
oh
so
do
i
said
margaret
yawning
i
wish
one
could
sleep
all
sunday
i
tell
you
what
said
george
i
know
a
game
we
can
play
and
no
harm
either
for
it
all
out
of
the
bible
oh
do
you
let
hear
it
george
cried
the
girls
i
do
believe
it
good
for
anything
if
it
is
out
of
the
bible
said
margaret
now
stare
ellen
chauncey
do
i
staring
said
ellen
indignantly
but
i
do
believe
it
is
right
to
play
it
if
it
out
of
the
bible
well
it
is
though
said
george
now
listen
i
think
of
somebody
in
the
bible
some
man
or
woman
you
know
and
you
may
all
ask
me
twenty
questions
about
him
to
see
if
you
can
find
out
who
it
is
what
kind
of
questions
any
kind
of
questions
whatever
you
like
that
will
improve
your
knowledge
of
scripture
history
said
gilbert
to
be
sure
and
exercise
our
memory
said
isabel
hawthorn
yes
and
then
we
are
thinking
of
good
people
and
what
they
did
all
the
time
said
little
ellen
or
bad
people
and
what
they
did
said
william
but
i
do
know
enough
about
people
and
things
in
the
bible
said
margaret
i
could
guess
oh
never
mind
it
will
be
all
the
more
fun
said
george
come
begin
who
take
somebody
oh
i
think
this
will
be
fine
said
little
ellen
chauncey
but
ellen
where
ellen
we
want
her
no
we
do
want
her
we
enough
without
her
she
wo
play
shouted
william
as
the
little
girl
ran
upstairs
she
persevered
however
ellen
had
left
her
sofa
before
this
and
was
found
seated
on
the
foot
of
her
bed
as
far
and
as
long
as
she
could
she
withstood
her
little
friend
entreaties
and
very
unwillingly
at
last
yielded
and
went
with
her
downstairs
now
we
are
ready
said
little
ellen
chauncey
i
have
told
ellen
what
the
game
is
who
going
to
begin
we
have
begun
said
william
gilbert
has
thought
of
somebody
man
or
woman
man
young
or
old
why
he
was
young
first
and
old
afterwards
pshaw
william
what
a
ridiculous
question
said
his
sister
besides
you
must
ask
more
than
one
at
a
time
rich
or
poor
gilbert
humph
why
i
suppose
he
was
moderately
well
off
i
dare
say
i
should
think
myself
a
lucky
fellow
if
i
had
as
much
are
you
answering
truly
gilbert
upon
my
honour
was
he
in
a
high
or
low
station
of
life
asked
miss
hawthorn
neither
at
the
top
nor
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
a
very
respectable
person
indeed
but
we
are
not
getting
on
said
margaret
according
to
you
he
anything
in
particular
what
kind
of
a
person
was
he
gilbert
a
very
good
man
handsome
or
ugly
history
do
say
well
what
it
say
said
george
what
did
he
do
he
took
a
journey
once
upon
a
time
what
for
do
you
mean
he
went
or
what
was
the
of
his
going
why
the
one
the
same
as
the
other
ai
it
i
beg
your
pardon
well
what
was
the
object
of
his
going
he
went
after
a
wife
samson
samson
shouted
william
and
isabel
and
ellen
chauncey
no
it
was
samson
either
i
ca
think
of
anybody
else
that
went
after
a
wife
said
george
that
king
what
his
name
that
married
esther
the
children
screamed
did
go
after
a
wife
george
his
wives
were
brought
to
him

it
jacob
no
he
did
go
after
a
wife
either
said
gilbert
he
married
two
of
them
but
he
did
go
to
his
uncle
to
find
them
you
had
better
go
on
with
your
questions
you
have
had
eight
already
if
you
do
look
out
you
wo
catch
me
come
did
he
get
the
wife
that
he
went
after
asked
ellen
chauncey
he
was
never
married
that
i
know
of
said
gilbert
what
was
the
reason
he
failed
said
isabel
he
did
not
fail
did
he
bring
home
his
wife
then
you
said
he
was
married
he
never
was
that
i
know
of
but
he
brought
home
a
wife
notwithstanding
but
how
funny
you
are
gilbert
said
little
ellen
he
had
a
wife
and
he
had
a
wife
what
became
of
her
she
lived
and
flourished
twelve
questions
take
care
nobody
asked
what
country
he
was
of
said
margaret
what
was
he
gilbert
he
was
a
damascene
a
of
damascus
of
damascus
you
know
where
damascus
is
do
you
fiddle
said
marianne
i
thought
he
was
a
jew
did
he
live
before
or
after
the
flood
after
i
should
think
you
might
have
known
that
well
i
ca
make
out
anything
about
him
said
marianne
we
shall
have
to
give
it
up
no
no
not
yet
said
william
where
did
he
go
after
his
wife
too
close
a
question
then
that
do
count
had
he
ever
seen
her
before
never
was
she
willing
to
go
with
him
very
willing
ladies
always
are
when
they
go
to
be
married
and
what
became
of
her
she
was
married
and
lived
happily
as
i
told
you
but
you
said
was
married
well
what
then
i
did
say
she
married
whom
did
she
marry
ah
that
is
asking
the
whole
i
ca
tell
you
had
they
far
to
go
asked
isabel
several
days
journey
i
do
know
how
far
how
did
they
travel
on
camels
was
it
the
queen
of
sheba
said
little
ellen
there
was
a
roar
of
laughter
at
this
happy
thought
and
poor
little
ellen
declared
she
forgot
all
but
about
the
journey
she
remembered
the
queen
of
sheba
had
taken
a
journey
and
the
camels
in
the
picture
of
the
queen
of
sheba
and
that
made
her
think
of
her
the
children
gave
up
questioning
seemed
hopeless
and
gilbert
at
last
told
them
his
thought
it
was
eleazar
abraham
steward
whom
he
sent
to
fetch
a
wife
for
his
son
isaac
why
have
guessed
little
mumchance
said
gilbert
to
ellen
montgomery
i
have
guessed
said
ellen
i
knew
who
it
was
some
time
ago
then
why
did
you
say
so
and
you
have
asked
a
single
question
said
george
no
you
have
asked
a
single
question
said
ellen
chauncey
she
is
a
great
deal
too
good
for
that
said
william
she
thinks
it
is
wicked
and
that
we
are
not
at
all
nice
boys
and
girls
to
be
playing
on
sunday
she
is
very
sorry
she
could
not
help
being
amused
you
think
it
is
wicked
ellen
asked
her
little
friend
do
you
think
it
is
right
said
george
walsh
ellen
hesitated
she
saw
they
were
all
waiting
to
hear
what
she
would
say
she
coloured
and
looked
down
at
her
little
bible
which
was
still
in
her
hand
it
encouraged
her
i
do
want
to
say
anything
rude
she
began
i
do
think
it
is
quite
right
to
play
such
plays
or
any
plays
she
was
attacked
with
impatient
cries
of
why
not
why
not
because
said
ellen
trembling
with
the
effort
she
made
i
think
sunday
was
meant
to
be
spent
in
growing
better
and
learning
good
things
and
i
do
think
such
plays
would
help
one
at
all
to
do
that
and
i
have
a
kind
of
that
i
ought
not
to
do
it
well
i
hope
you
act
according
to
your
then
said
william
i
am
sure
nobody
has
any
objection
you
had
better
go
somewhere
else
though
for
we
are
going
on
we
have
been
learning
to
be
good
long
enough
for
one
day
come
i
have
thought
of
somebody
ellen
could
not
help
feeling
hurt
and
sorry
at
the
half
sneer
she
saw
in
the
look
and
manner
of
the
others
as
well
as
in
william
words
she
wished
for
no
better
than
to
go
away
but
as
she
did
so
her
bosom
swelled
and
the
tears
started
and
her
breath
came
quicker
she
found
alice
lying
down
and
asleep
miss
sophia
beside
her
so
she
stole
out
again
and
went
down
to
the
library
finding
nobody
she
took
possession
of
the
sofa
and
tried
to
read
again
reading
somehow
did
not
go
well
and
she
fell
to
musing
on
what
had
just
passed
she
thought
of
the
unkindness
of
the
children
how
sure
she
was
it
was
wrong
to
spend
any
part
of
sunday
in
such
games
what
alice
would
think
of
it
and
john
and
her
mother
and
how
the
sundays
long
ago
used
to
be
spent
when
that
dear
mother
was
with
her
and
then
she
wondered
how
was
passing
this
very
one
while
ellen
was
sitting
here
in
the
library
alone
what
was
doing
in
that
land
and
she
thought
if
there
only
such
things
as
oracles
that
could
tell
truly
how
much
she
would
like
to
ask
about
her
ellen
said
the
voice
of
john
from
the
window
she
started
up
she
had
thought
she
was
alone
but
there
he
was
lying
in
the
window
seat
what
are
you
doing
nothing
said
ellen
come
here
what
are
you
thinking
about
i
did
know
you
were
there
till
i
heard
two
or
three
very
long
sighs
what
is
the
matter
with
my
little
sister
he
took
her
hand
and
drew
her
fondly
up
to
him
what
were
you
thinking
about
i
was
thinking
about
different
things
nothing
is
the
matter
said
ellen
then
what
are
those
tears
in
your
eyes
for
i
do
know
said
she
laughing
there
were
any
till
i
came
here
i
was
thinking
just
now
about
mamma
he
said
no
more
still
however
keeping
her
beside
him
i
should
think
said
ellen
presently
after
a
few
minutes
musing
look
out
of
the
window
it
would
be
very
pleasant
if
there
were
such
things
as
oracles
do
you
mr
john
no
but
would
you
like
to
know
something
about
what
going
to
happen
i
do
know
a
great
deal
about
it
about
what
is
going
to
happen
he
smiled
yes
a
great
deal
ellie
enough
to
give
me
work
for
all
the
rest
of
my
life
oh
you
mean
from
the
bible
i
was
thinking
of
other
things
it
is
best
not
to
know
the
other
things
ellie
i
am
very
glad
to
know
those
the
bible
teaches
us
but
it
does
tell
us
much
does
it
what
does
it
tell
us
go
to
the
window
and
tell
me
what
you
see
i
do
see
anything
in
particular
said
ellen
after
taking
a
grave
look
out
well
what
in
general
why
there
is
the
lawn
covered
with
snow
and
the
trees
and
bushes
and
the
sun
is
shining
on
everything
just
as
it
did
the
day
we
came
and
there
the
long
shadow
of
that
hemlock
across
the
snow
and
the
blue
sky
now
look
out
again
ellie
and
listen
i
know
that
a
day
is
to
come
when
those
heavens
shall
be
wrapped
together
as
a
scroll
they
shall
vanish
away
like
smoke
and
the
earth
shall
wax
old
like
a
garment
and
it
and
all
the
works
that
are
therein
shall
be
burned
up
as
he
spoke
ellen
fancy
tried
to
follow
to
picture
the
ruin
and
desolation
of
all
that
stood
so
fair
and
seemed
to
stand
so
firm
before
her
but
the
sun
shone
on
the
branches
waved
gently
in
the
wind
the
shadows
lay
still
on
the
snow
and
the
blue
heaven
was
fair
and
cloudless
fancy
was
baffled
she
turned
from
the
window
do
you
believe
it
said
john
yes
said
ellen
i
know
it
but
i
think
it
is
very
disagreeable
to
think
about
it
it
would
be
ellie
said
he
bringing
her
again
to
his
side
very
disagreeable
very
miserable
indeed
if
we
knew
no
more
than
that
but
we
know
more
read
here
ellen
took
his
little
bible
and
read
at
the
open
place
i
create
new
heavens
and
a
new
earth
and
the
former
shall
not
be
remembered
neither
come
into
mind
why
wo
they
be
remembered
said
ellen
shall
we
forget
all
about
them
no
i
do
not
think
that
is
meant
the
new
heavens
and
the
new
earth
will
be
so
much
more
lovely
and
pleasant
that
we
shall
not
want
to
think
of
these
ellen
eyes
sought
the
window
again
you
are
thinking
that
it
is
hardly
possible
said
john
with
a
smile
i
suppose
it
is
said
ellen
but
but
lovely
as
this
world
is
ellie
man
has
filled
it
with
sin
and
sin
has
everywhere
brought
its
punishment
and
under
the
weight
of
both
the
earth
groans
there
will
be
no
sin
sorrow
and
sighing
shall
flee
away
love
to
each
other
and
love
to
their
blessed
king
will
fill
all
hearts
and
his
presence
will
be
with
them
do
you
see
that
even
if
that
world
shall
be
in
itself
no
better
than
this
it
will
yet
be
far
far
more
lovely
than
this
can
ever
be
with
the
shadow
of
sin
upon
it
oh
yes
said
ellen
i
know
whenever
i
feel
wrong
in
any
way
nothing
seems
pretty
or
pleasant
to
me
or
not
half
so
much
very
well
said
john
i
see
you
understand
me
i
like
to
think
of
that
land
ellen
very
much
john
said
ellen
do
you
think
people
will
know
each
other
again
those
that
love
each
other
here
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
before
either
john
or
ellen
had
broken
the
long
musing
fit
that
followed
these
words
they
were
joined
by
alice
her
head
was
better
and
taking
her
place
in
the
the
talk
began
again
between
the
brother
and
sister
now
ellen
too
happy
to
sit
with
them
and
listen
they
talked
of
that
land
again
of
the
happy
company
preparing
for
it
of
their
dead
mother
but
not
much
of
her
of
the
glory
of
their
king
and
the
joy
of
his
service
even
here
till
thoughts
grew
too
strong
for
words
and
silence
again
stole
upon
the
group
the
short
winter
day
came
to
an
end
the
sunlight
faded
away
into
moonlight
no
shadows
lay
now
on
the
lawn
and
from
where
she
sat
ellen
could
see
the
great
hemlock
all
silvered
with
the
moonlight
which
began
to
steal
in
at
the
window
it
was
very
very
beautiful
yet
she
could
think
now
without
sorrow
that
all
this
should
come
to
an
end
because
of
that
new
heaven
and
new
earth
wherein
righteousness
should
dwell
we
have
eaten
up
all
your
grapes
ellie
said
alice
or
rather
have
for
john
did
help
me
much
i
think
i
never
ate
so
sweet
grapes
in
my
life
john
said
the
reason
was
because
every
one
tasted
of
you
i
am
very
glad
said
ellen
laughing
there
is
no
evil
without
some
good
alice
went
on
except
for
my
headache
john
would
not
have
held
my
head
by
the
hour
as
he
did
and
you
could
have
given
me
the
pleasure
you
did
ellie
oh
jack
there
has
been
many
a
day
lately
when
i
would
gladly
have
had
a
headache
for
the
power
of
laying
my
head
on
your
shoulder
and
if
mamma
had
not
gone
away
i
should
never
have
known
you
said
ellen
i
wish
she
never
gone
but
i
am
very
very
glad
for
this
she
had
kneeled
upon
the
and
clasped
alice
round
the
neck
just
as
they
were
called
to
tea
the
conversation
had
banished
every
disagreeable
feeling
from
ellen
mind
she
met
her
companions
in
the
almost
forgetting
that
she
had
any
cause
of
complaint
against
them
and
this
appeared
when
in
the
course
of
the
evening
it
came
in
her
way
to
perform
some
little
office
of
politeness
for
marianne
it
was
done
with
the
gracefulness
that
could
only
come
from
a
spirit
entirely
free
from
ungrateful
feelings
the
children
felt
it
and
for
the
time
were
shamed
into
better
behaviour
the
evening
passed
pleasantly
and
ellen
went
to
bed
very
happy
chapter
xxxi
the
ancient
heroes
were
illustrious
for
being
benign
and
not
blustrous
hudibras
the
next
day
it
happened
that
the
young
people
were
amusing
themselves
with
talking
in
a
room
where
john
humphreys
walking
up
and
down
was
amusing
with
thinking
in
the
course
of
his
walk
he
began
to
find
their
amusement
rather
disturbing
to
his
the
children
were
all
grouped
closely
around
margaret
dunscombe
who
was
entertaining
them
with
a
long
and
very
detailed
account
of
a
wedding
and
great
party
at
randolph
which
she
had
had
the
happiness
of
attending
eagerly
fighting
her
battles
over
again
and
pleased
with
the
rapt
attention
of
her
hearers
the
speaker
forgot
herself
and
raised
her
voice
much
more
than
she
meant
to
do
as
every
turn
of
his
walk
brought
john
near
there
came
to
his
ears
sufficient
bits
and
scraps
of
margaret
story
to
give
him
a
very
fair
sample
of
the
whole
and
he
was
sorry
to
see
ellen
among
the
rest
and
as
the
rest
hanging
upon
her
lips
and
drinking
in
what
seemed
to
him
to
be
very
poor
nonsense
her
gown
was
all
blue
satin
trimmed
here
and
so
you
know
with
the
most
lace
as
deep
as
that
and
on
the
shoulders
and
here
you
know
it
was
looped
up
with
the
most
lovely
bunches
of
here
john
lost
the
sense
when
he
came
near
again
she
had
got
upon
a
different
topic
simmons
says
i
did
you
do
that
for
says
she
could
i
help
it
i
saw
payne
coming
and
i
thought
i
get
behind
you
and
so
the
next
time
the
speaker
was
saying
with
great
animation
and
lo
and
behold
when
i
was
in
the
midst
of
all
my
pleasure
up
comes
a
little
gentleman
of
about
his
dimensions
he
had
not
taken
many
turns
when
he
saw
that
margaret
nonsense
was
branching
out
right
and
left
into
worse
than
nonsense
ellen
said
he
suddenly
i
want
you
in
the
library
my
conscience
said
margaret
as
he
left
the
room
king
john
the
second
and
no
less
do
go
on
till
i
come
back
said
ellen
i
wo
be
three
minutes
just
wait
for
me
she
found
john
seated
at
one
of
the
tables
in
the
library
sharpening
a
pencil
ellen
said
he
in
his
usual
manner
i
want
you
to
do
something
for
me
she
waited
eagerly
to
hear
what
but
instead
of
telling
her
he
took
a
piece
of
and
began
to
sketch
something
ellen
stood
by
wondering
and
impatient
to
the
last
degree
not
caring
however
to
show
her
impatience
though
her
very
feet
were
twitching
to
run
back
to
her
companions
ellen
said
john
as
he
finished
the
old
stump
of
a
tree
with
one
branch
left
on
it
and
a
little
bit
of
ground
at
the
bottom
did
you
ever
try
your
hand
at
drawing
no
said
ellen
then
sit
down
here
said
he
rising
from
his
chair
and
let
me
see
what
you
can
make
of
that
but
i
do
know
how
said
ellen
i
will
teach
you
there
is
a
piece
of
paper
and
this
pencil
is
sharp
enough
is
that
chair
too
low
for
you
he
placed
another
and
with
extreme
unwillingness
and
some
displeasure
ellen
sat
down
it
was
on
her
tongue
to
ask
if
another
time
would
not
do
but
somehow
she
could
not
get
the
words
out
john
showed
her
how
to
hold
her
pencil
how
to
place
her
paper
where
to
begin
and
how
to
go
on
and
then
went
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
took
up
his
walk
again
ellen
at
first
felt
more
inclined
to
drive
her
pencil
the
paper
than
to
make
quiet
marks
upon
it
however
necessity
was
upon
her
she
began
her
work
and
once
fairly
begun
it
grew
delightfully
interesting
her
vexation
went
off
entirely
she
forgot
margaret
and
her
story
the
wrinkles
on
the
old
trunk
smoothed
those
on
her
brow
and
those
troublesome
leaves
at
the
branch
end
brushed
away
all
thoughts
of
everything
else
her
cheeks
were
burning
with
intense
interest
when
the
library
door
burst
open
and
the
whole
troop
of
children
rushed
in
they
wanted
ellen
for
a
round
game
in
which
all
their
number
were
needed
and
she
must
come
directly
i
ca
come
just
yet
said
she
i
must
finish
this
first
afterwards
will
just
do
as
well
said
george
come
ellen
do
you
can
finish
it
afterwards
no
i
ca
said
ellen
i
ca
leave
it
till
it
done
why
i
thought
john
was
here
i
did
see
him
go
out
i
come
in
a
little
while
did
set
you
about
that
precious
piece
of
business
said
william
yes
i
declare
said
margaret
he
fitter
to
be
the
grand
turk
than
any
one
else
i
know
of
i
tell
you
said
william
putting
his
mouth
close
to
her
ear
and
speaking
in
a
disagreeable
loud
whisper
it
the
biggest
gobbler
in
the
yard
ai
you
ashamed
william
cried
little
ellen
chauncey
that
it
exactly
said
margaret
always
strutting
about
he
is
a
bit
said
ellen
very
angry
i
seen
people
a
great
deal
more
like
gobblers
than
he
is
well
said
william
reddening
in
his
turn
i
had
rather
at
any
rate
be
a
good
turkey
gobbler
than
one
of
those
outlandish
birds
that
have
an
appetite
for
stones
and
glass
and
bits
of
morocco
and
such
things
come
let
us
leave
her
to
do
the
grand
turk
bidding
come
ellen
chauncey
you
must
stay
to
interrupt
her
we
want
you
they
left
her
alone
ellen
had
coloured
but
william
words
did
not
hit
very
sore
since
john
talk
with
her
about
the
matter
referred
to
she
had
thought
of
it
humbly
and
wisely
it
is
only
pride
that
makes
such
very
hard
to
bear
she
was
very
sorry
however
that
they
had
fallen
out
again
and
that
her
own
passion
as
she
feared
had
been
the
cause
a
few
tears
had
to
be
wiped
away
before
she
could
see
exactly
how
the
old
tree
stood
then
taking
up
her
pencil
she
soon
forgot
everything
in
her
work
it
was
finished
and
with
head
now
on
one
side
now
on
the
other
she
was
looking
at
her
picture
with
very
great
satisfaction
when
her
eye
caught
the
figure
of
john
standing
before
her
is
it
done
said
he
it
is
done
said
ellen
smiling
as
she
rose
up
to
let
him
come
he
sat
down
to
look
at
it
it
is
very
well
he
said
better
than
i
expected
it
is
very
well
indeed
is
this
your
trial
ellen
yes
the
first
you
found
it
pleasant
work
oh
very
very
pleasant
i
like
it
dearly
then
i
will
teach
you
this
shows
you
have
a
taste
for
it
and
that
is
precisely
what
i
wanted
to
find
out
i
will
give
you
an
easier
copy
next
time
i
rather
expected
when
you
sat
down
said
he
smiling
a
little
that
the
old
tree
would
grow
a
good
deal
more
crooked
under
your
hands
than
i
meant
it
to
be
ellen
blushed
exceedingly
i
do
believe
john
she
said
stammering
that
you
know
everything
i
am
thinking
about
i
might
do
that
ellen
without
being
as
wise
as
an
oracle
but
i
do
not
expect
to
make
any
very
painful
discoveries
in
that
line
answered
john
humphreys
ellen
thought
if
he
did
not
it
would
not
be
her
fault
she
truly
repented
her
momentary
anger
and
hasty
speech
to
william
not
that
he
did
not
deserve
it
or
that
it
was
not
true
but
it
was
unwise
and
had
done
mischief
and
it
was
not
a
bit
like
peacemaking
nor
meek
at
all
ellen
said
to
herself
she
had
been
reading
that
morning
the
fifth
chapter
of
matthew
and
it
ran
in
her
head
blessed
are
the
meek
blessed
are
the
peacemakers
for
they
shall
be
called
the
children
of
god
she
strove
to
get
back
a
pleasant
feeling
toward
her
young
companions
and
prayed
that
she
might
not
be
angry
at
anything
they
should
say
she
was
tried
again
at
miss
sophia
had
quitted
the
table
bidding
william
hand
the
to
those
who
could
not
reach
them
marianne
took
a
great
while
to
make
her
choice
her
brother
grew
impatient
well
i
hope
you
have
suited
yourself
said
he
come
miss
montgomery
do
you
be
as
long
my
arm
is
tired
shut
your
eyes
and
then
you
be
sure
to
get
the
biggest
one
in
the
basket
no
ellen
said
john
who
none
of
the
children
thought
was
near
it
would
be
ungenerous
i
would
deprive
master
william
of
his
best
arguments
what
do
you
mean
by
my
arguments
said
william
sharply
generally
those
which
are
the
most
difficult
to
take
in
answered
his
tormentor
with
perfect
gravity
ellen
tried
to
keep
from
smiling
but
could
not
and
others
of
the
party
did
not
try
william
and
his
sister
were
enraged
the
more
because
john
had
said
nothing
they
could
take
hold
of
or
even
repeat
gilbert
made
common
cause
with
them
i
wish
i
was
grown
up
for
once
said
william
will
you
fight
sir
asked
gilbert
who
was
a
matter
of
three
years
older
and
well
grown
enough
his
question
received
no
answer
and
was
repeated
no
sir
why
not
sir
i
am
afraid
you
lay
me
up
with
a
sprained
ankle
said
john
and
i
should
not
get
back
to
doncaster
as
quickly
as
i
must
it
is
very
mean
of
him
said
gilbert
as
john
walked
away
i
could
whip
him
i
know
who
that
said
howard
marshman
john
humphreys
john
humphreys
you
had
better
not
meddle
with
him
my
dear
fellow
it
would
be
no
particular
proof
of
wisdom
why
he
no
such
great
affair
said
gilbert
he
is
tall
enough
to
be
sure
but
i
do
believe
he
is
heavier
than
i
am
you
do
know
in
the
first
place
how
to
judge
of
the
size
of
a
perfectly
man
and
in
the
second
place
was
not
a
match
for
him
a
year
ago
so
you
may
judge
i
do
not
know
precisely
he
went
on
to
the
lady
he
was
walking
with
what
it
takes
to
rouse
john
humphreys
but
when
he
roused
he
seems
to
me
to
have
strength
enough
for
twice
his
bone
and
muscle
i
have
seen
him
do
curious
things
once
or
twice
that
quiet
mr
humphreys
humph
said
howard
gunpowder
is
pretty
quiet
stuff
so
long
as
it
keeps
cool
the
next
day
another
matter
happened
to
disturb
ellen
margaret
had
received
an
elegant
pair
of
as
a
christmas
present
and
was
showing
them
for
the
admiration
of
her
young
friends
ellen
did
not
satisfy
her
ai
they
splendid
said
she
tell
the
truth
now
ellen
montgomery
would
you
give
a
great
deal
if
somebody
would
send
you
such
a
pair
they
are
very
pretty
said
ellen
but
i
do
think
i
care
much
for
such
things
i
would
rather
have
the
money
oh
you
avaricious
mr
marshman
cried
margaret
as
the
old
gentleman
was
just
then
passing
through
the
room
here
ellen
montgomery
says
she
rather
have
money
than
anything
else
for
present
he
did
not
seem
to
hear
her
and
went
out
without
making
any
reply
o
margaret
said
ellen
shocked
and
distressed
how
could
you
how
could
you
what
will
marshman
think
margaret
answered
she
did
care
what
he
thought
ellen
could
only
hope
he
had
not
heard
but
a
day
or
two
after
when
neither
ellen
nor
her
friends
were
present
marshman
asked
who
it
was
that
had
told
him
ellen
montgomery
would
like
money
better
than
anything
else
for
her
new
year
present
it
was
i
sir
said
margaret
it
sounds
very
unlike
her
to
say
so
remarked
chauncey
did
she
say
so
inquired
marshman
i
understood
her
so
said
margaret
i
understood
her
to
say
she
would
care
for
anything
else
i
am
disappointed
in
her
said
the
old
gentleman
i
would
have
believed
it
i
do
not
believe
it
said
chauncey
quietly
there
has
been
some
mistake
it
was
hard
for
ellen
now
to
keep
to
what
she
thought
right
disagreeable
feelings
would
rise
when
she
remembered
the
impoliteness
the
the
whole
taunt
and
the
real
unkindness
of
several
of
the
young
party
she
found
herself
ready
to
be
irritated
inclined
to
dislike
the
sight
of
those
even
wishing
to
visit
some
sort
of
punishment
upon
them
but
christian
principle
had
taken
strong
hold
in
little
ellen
heart
she
fought
her
evil
tempers
manfully
it
was
not
an
easy
battle
to
gain
ellen
found
that
resentment
and
pride
had
roots
deep
enough
to
keep
her
pulling
up
the
shoots
for
a
good
while
she
used
to
get
alone
when
she
could
to
read
a
verse
if
no
more
of
her
bible
and
pray
she
could
forgive
william
and
margaret
more
easily
then
solitude
and
darkness
saw
many
a
prayer
and
tear
of
hers
that
week
as
she
struggled
thus
to
get
rid
of
sin
and
to
be
more
like
what
would
please
god
she
grew
humble
and
happy
never
was
such
a
struggle
carried
on
by
faith
in
him
without
success
and
after
a
time
though
a
twinge
of
the
old
feeling
might
come
it
was
very
slight
she
would
bid
william
and
margaret
and
join
them
in
any
enterprise
of
pleasure
or
business
with
a
brow
as
unclouded
as
the
sun
they
however
were
too
conscious
of
having
behaved
unbecomingly
towards
their
little
strange
guest
to
be
over
fond
of
her
company
for
the
most
part
she
and
ellen
chauncey
were
left
to
each
other
meanwhile
the
famous
was
in
a
fair
way
to
be
finished
great
dismay
had
at
first
been
excited
in
the
breast
of
the
intended
giver
by
the
discovery
that
gilbert
had
consulted
what
seemed
to
be
a
very
extraordinary
fancy
in
making
the
rose
a
yellow
one
ellen
did
her
best
to
comfort
her
she
asked
alice
and
found
there
were
such
things
as
yellow
roses
and
they
were
very
beautiful
too
and
besides
it
would
match
so
nicely
the
yellow
butterfly
on
the
other
leaf
i
had
rather
it
would
match
said
ellen
chauncey
and
it
match
the
silk
besides
are
the
yellow
roses
sweet
no
said
ellen
but
could
have
been
a
sweet
rose
at
any
rate
you
know
oh
but
said
the
other
bursting
out
into
a
fresh
passion
of
inconsolable
tears
i
wanted
it
should
be
the
of
a
sweet
rose
and
i
think
he
might
have
put
a
purple
butterfly
yellow
butterflies
are
so
common
i
had
a
great
deal
rather
had
a
purple
butterfly
and
a
red
rose
what
can
not
be
cured
however
must
be
endured
the
tears
were
dried
in
course
of
time
and
the
with
its
yellow
pictures
and
pink
edges
was
very
neatly
finished
ellen
had
been
busy
too
on
her
own
account
alice
had
got
a
piece
of
fine
linen
for
her
from
miss
sophia
the
collar
for
van
brunt
had
been
cut
out
and
ellen
with
great
pleasure
had
made
it
the
stitching
the
strings
and
the
very
after
infinite
pains
were
all
finished
by
thursday
night
she
had
also
made
a
for
alice
not
of
so
much
pretension
as
the
other
one
this
was
green
morocco
lined
with
crimson
satin
no
leaves
but
ribbon
stitched
in
to
hold
papers
of
needles
and
a
place
for
a
bodkin
ellen
worked
very
hard
at
this
it
was
made
with
the
extremest
care
and
made
beautifully
ellen
chauncey
admired
it
very
much
and
anew
lamented
the
uncouth
variety
of
colours
in
her
own
it
was
a
grave
question
whether
pink
or
yellow
ribbon
should
be
used
for
the
latter
ellen
montgomery
recommended
pink
she
herself
inclined
to
yellow
and
tired
of
doubting
at
last
resolved
to
split
the
difference
and
put
one
string
of
each
colour
ellen
thought
that
did
not
mend
matters
but
wisely
kept
her
thoughts
to
herself
besides
the
for
alice
she
had
snatched
the
time
whenever
she
could
get
away
from
ellen
chauncey
to
work
at
something
for
her
she
had
begged
alice
advice
and
help
and
between
them
out
of
ellen
scraps
of
morocco
and
silk
they
had
manufactured
a
little
bag
of
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
and
very
pretty
and
tasteful
withal
ellen
thought
it
a
and
was
unbounded
in
her
admiration
it
lay
folded
up
in
white
paper
in
a
locked
drawer
ready
for
new
year
day
in
addition
to
all
these
pieces
of
business
john
had
begun
to
give
her
drawing
lessons
according
to
his
promise
these
became
ellen
delight
she
would
willingly
have
spent
much
more
time
upon
them
than
he
would
allow
her
it
was
the
most
loved
employment
of
the
day
her
teacher
skill
was
not
greater
than
the
perfect
gentleness
and
kindness
with
which
he
taught
ellen
thought
of
howard
speech
about
gunpowder
she
could
not
understand
it
what
is
your
conclusion
on
the
whole
asked
john
one
day
as
he
stood
beside
her
mending
a
pencil
why
said
ellen
laughing
and
blushing
how
you
guess
what
i
was
thinking
about
mr
john
not
very
difficult
when
you
are
eyeing
me
so
hard
i
was
thinking
said
ellen
i
do
know
whether
it
is
right
in
me
to
tell
it
because
somebody
said
you
well
were
like
gunpowder
very
kind
of
somebody
and
so
you
have
been
in
doubt
of
an
explosion
no
i
do
know
i
wondered
what
he
meant
never
believe
what
you
hear
said
of
people
ellen
judge
for
yourself
look
here
that
house
has
suffered
from
a
severe
gale
of
wind
i
should
think
all
the
uprights
are
slanting
off
to
the
right
ca
you
set
it
up
straight
ellen
laughed
at
the
condition
of
the
house
as
thus
pointed
out
to
her
and
set
about
reforming
it
it
was
thursday
afternoon
that
alice
and
ellen
were
left
alone
in
the
library
several
of
the
family
having
been
called
out
to
receive
some
visitors
alice
had
excused
herself
and
ellen
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
nestled
up
to
her
side
how
pleasant
it
is
to
be
alone
together
dear
alice
i
do
have
you
even
at
night
now
it
is
very
pleasant
dear
ellie
home
will
not
look
disagreeable
again
will
it
even
after
all
our
gaiety
here
no
indeed
at
least
home
wo
i
do
know
what
mine
will
oh
me
i
had
almost
forgotten
aunt
fortune
never
mind
dear
ellie
you
and
i
have
each
something
to
bear
we
must
be
brave
and
bear
it
manfully
there
is
a
friend
that
sticketh
closer
than
a
brother
you
know
we
sha
be
unhappy
if
we
do
our
duty
and
love
him
how
soon
is
john
going
away
not
for
all
next
week
and
so
long
as
he
stays
i
do
not
mean
that
you
shall
leave
me
ellen
cried
for
joy
i
can
manage
it
with
miss
fortune
i
know
said
alice
these
fine
drawing
lessons
must
not
be
interrupted
john
is
very
much
pleased
with
your
performances
is
he
said
ellen
delighted
i
have
taken
all
the
pains
i
could
that
is
the
sure
way
to
success
ellie
but
ellie
i
want
to
ask
you
about
something
what
was
that
you
said
to
margaret
dunscombe
about
wanting
money
for
a
new
year
present
you
know
it
then
cried
ellen
starting
up
oh
i
am
so
glad
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
about
it
so
i
did
know
what
to
do
and
i
thought
i
ought
to
what
shall
i
do
about
it
dear
alice
how
did
you
know
george
said
you
were
not
there
chauncey
told
me
she
thought
there
had
been
some
mistake
or
something
wrong
how
was
it
ellen
why
said
ellen
she
was
showing
us
her
and
asking
us
what
we
thought
of
them
and
she
asked
me
if
i
would
like
to
have
such
a
pair
and
i
thought
i
would
a
great
deal
rather
have
the
money
they
cost
to
buy
other
things
with
you
know
that
i
would
like
better
and
i
said
so
and
just
then
marshman
came
in
and
she
called
out
to
him
loud
that
i
wanted
money
for
a
present
or
would
like
it
better
than
anything
else
or
something
like
that
o
alice
how
i
felt
i
was
frightened
but
then
i
hoped
marshman
did
not
hear
her
for
he
did
not
say
anything
but
the
next
day
george
told
me
all
about
what
she
had
been
saying
in
there
and
oh
it
made
me
so
unhappy
said
poor
ellen
looking
very
dismal
what
marshman
think
of
me
he
will
think
i
expected
a
present
and
i
never
of
such
a
thing
it
makes
me
ashamed
to
speak
of
it
even
and
i
he
should
think
so
i
ca
bear
it
what
shall
i
do
dear
alice
i
do
know
what
you
can
do
dear
ellie
but
be
patient
marshman
will
not
think
anything
very
hard
of
you
i
dare
say
but
i
think
he
does
already
he
has
kissed
me
since
that
as
he
did
before
i
know
he
does
and
i
do
know
what
to
do
how
could
margaret
say
that
oh
how
could
she
it
was
very
unkind
what
can
i
do
said
ellen
again
after
a
pause
and
wiping
away
a
few
tears
could
chauncey
tell
marshman
not
to
give
me
anything
for
that
i
never
expected
it
and
would
a
great
deal
rather
not
why
no
ellie
i
do
not
think
that
would
be
exactly
the
best
or
most
dignified
way
what
then
dear
alice
i
do
just
as
you
say
i
would
just
remain
quiet
but
ellen
says
the
things
are
all
put
on
the
plates
in
the
morning
and
if
there
should
be
money
on
mine
i
do
know
what
i
should
do
i
should
feel
so
badly
i
could
keep
it
alice
i
could
very
well
you
need
not
but
remain
quiet
in
the
meanwhile
and
if
it
should
be
so
then
say
what
you
please
only
take
care
that
you
say
it
in
a
right
spirit
and
in
a
right
manner
nobody
can
hurt
you
much
my
child
while
you
keep
the
even
path
of
duty
poor
margaret
is
her
own
worst
enemy
then
if
there
should
be
money
in
the
morning
i
may
tell
marshman
the
truth
about
it
certainly
only
do
not
be
in
haste
speak
gently
oh
i
wish
everybody
would
be
kind
and
pleasant
always
said
poor
ellen
but
half
comforted
what
a
sigh
was
there
said
john
coming
in
what
is
the
matter
with
my
little
sister
some
of
the
minor
trials
of
life
john
said
alice
with
a
smile
what
is
the
matter
ellie
oh
something
you
ca
help
said
ellen
and
something
i
must
know
well
to
change
the
scene
suppose
you
go
with
me
to
visit
the
greenhouse
and
hothouses
have
you
seen
them
yet
no
said
ellen
as
she
eagerly
sprang
forward
to
take
his
hand
ellen
promised
to
go
with
me
but
we
have
been
so
busy
will
you
come
alice
not
i
said
alice
i
wish
i
could
but
i
shall
be
wanted
elsewhere
by
whom
i
wonder
so
much
as
by
me
said
her
brother
however
after
i
will
have
you
all
to
myself
as
he
and
ellen
were
crossing
the
hall
they
met
marshman
where
are
you
going
john
said
she
where
i
ought
to
have
been
before
to
pay
my
respects
to
mr
hutchinson
you
not
seen
him
yet
that
is
very
ungrateful
of
you
hutchinson
is
one
of
your
warmest
friends
and
admirers
there
are
few
people
he
mentions
with
so
much
respect
or
that
he
is
so
glad
to
see
as
john
humphreys
a
distinction
i
owe
i
fear
principally
to
my
english
blood
said
john
shaking
his
head
it
is
not
altogether
that
said
marshman
laughing
though
i
do
believe
i
am
the
only
yankee
good
hutchinson
has
ever
made
up
his
mind
entirely
to
like
but
go
and
see
him
do
he
will
be
very
much
pleased
who
is
mr
hutchinson
said
ellen
as
they
went
on
he
is
the
gardener
or
rather
the
he
came
out
with
his
master
some
thirty
or
forty
years
ago
but
his
old
english
prejudice
will
go
to
the
grave
with
him
i
believe
but
why
do
he
like
the
americans
john
laughed
it
would
never
do
for
me
to
attempt
to
answer
that
question
ellie
fond
of
going
to
the
bottom
of
things
as
you
are
we
should
just
get
to
hard
fighting
about
and
should
barely
make
peace
by
at
the
most
moderate
calculation
you
shall
have
an
answer
to
your
question
however
ellen
could
not
conceive
what
he
meant
but
resolved
to
wait
for
his
promised
answer
as
they
entered
the
large
and
greenhouse
hutchinson
came
from
the
farther
end
of
it
to
meet
them
an
old
man
of
most
respectable
appearance
he
bowed
very
civilly
and
then
slipped
his
into
his
left
hand
to
leave
the
right
at
liberty
for
john
who
shook
it
cordially
and
why
you
been
to
see
me
before
john
i
have
thought
it
rather
of
you
miss
has
come
several
times
the
ladies
have
more
leisure
hutchinson
you
look
flourishing
here
why
yes
sir
pretty
middling
within
doors
but
i
do
like
the
climate
john
i
do
like
the
climate
sir
there
no
country
like
i
believe
for
my
business
a
fine
rose
sir
if
you
step
a
bit
this
way
quite
a
new
kind
i
got
it
over
last
the
palmerston
it
is
those
are
fine
buds
sir
the
old
man
was
evidently
much
pleased
to
see
his
visitor
and
presently
plunged
him
deep
into
english
politics
for
which
he
seemed
to
have
lost
no
interest
by
forty
years
life
in
america
as
ellen
could
not
understand
what
they
were
talking
about
she
quitted
john
side
and
went
wandering
about
by
herself
from
the
moment
the
sweet
aromatic
smell
of
the
plants
had
greeted
her
she
had
been
in
a
high
state
of
delight
and
now
lost
to
all
the
world
beside
from
the
mystery
of
one
beautiful
and
strange
green
thing
to
another
she
went
wandering
and
admiring
and
now
and
then
timidly
advancing
her
nose
to
see
if
something
glorious
was
something
sweet
too
she
could
hardly
leave
a
superb
cactus
in
the
petals
of
which
there
was
such
a
singular
blending
of
scarlet
and
crimson
as
almost
to
dazzle
her
sight
and
if
the
pleasure
of
smell
could
intoxicate
she
would
have
away
from
a
luxuriant
daphne
odorata
in
full
flower
over
which
she
feasted
for
a
long
time
the
variety
of
green
leaves
alone
was
a
marvel
to
her
some
rough
and
some
shining
as
if
they
were
varnished
others
of
delicacy
of
structure
all
lovely
at
last
she
stood
still
with
admiration
and
almost
held
her
breath
before
a
white
camellia
what
does
that
flower
make
you
think
of
ellen
said
john
coming
up
his
friend
the
gardener
had
left
him
to
seek
a
newspaper
in
which
he
wished
to
show
him
a
paragraph
i
do
know
said
ellen
i
could
think
of
anything
but
itself
it
reminds
me
of
what
i
ought
to
be
and
of
what
i
shall
be
if
i
ever
see
heaven
it
seems
to
me
the
emblem
of
a
sinless
pure
spirit
looking
up
in
fearless
spotlessness
do
you
remember
what
was
said
to
the
old
church
of
sardis
hast
a
few
names
that
have
not
defiled
their
garments
and
they
shall
walk
with
me
in
white
for
they
are
worthy
the
tears
rushed
to
ellen
eyes
she
felt
she
was
so
very
unlike
this
but
hutchinson
coming
back
prevented
anything
more
from
being
said
she
looked
at
the
white
camellia
it
seemed
to
speak
to
her
that
the
paragraph
sir
said
the
old
gardener
giving
the
paper
to
john
a
little
lady
that
is
fond
of
flowers
if
i
do
make
a
mistake
this
is
somebody
i
not
seen
before
is
this
the
little
lady
miss
was
telling
me
about
i
presume
so
said
john
she
is
miss
ellen
montgomery
a
sister
of
mine
hutchinson
and
marshman
guest
by
both
names
to
my
greatest
respect
said
the
old
man
stepping
back
and
making
a
very
low
bow
to
ellen
with
his
hand
upon
his
heart
at
which
she
could
not
help
laughing
i
am
very
glad
to
see
miss
what
can
i
do
to
make
her
remember
old
would
miss
like
a
bouquet
ellen
did
not
venture
to
say
yes
but
her
blush
and
sparkling
eyes
answered
him
the
old
gardener
understood
her
and
was
as
good
as
his
word
he
began
with
cutting
a
beautiful
sprig
of
a
large
purple
geranium
then
a
slip
of
lemon
myrtle
ellen
watched
him
as
the
bunch
grew
in
his
hand
and
could
hardly
believe
her
eyes
as
one
beauty
after
another
was
added
to
what
became
a
most
elegant
bouquet
and
most
sweet
too
to
her
joy
the
delicious
daphne
and
fragrant
lemon
blossom
went
to
make
part
of
it
her
thanks
when
it
was
given
her
were
made
with
few
words
but
with
all
her
face
the
old
gardener
smiled
and
was
quite
satisfied
that
his
gift
was
not
thrown
away
he
afterwards
showed
them
his
hothouses
where
ellen
was
astonished
and
very
much
interested
to
see
ripe
oranges
and
lemons
in
abundance
and
pines
too
such
as
she
had
been
eating
since
she
came
to
ventnor
thinking
nothing
less
than
that
they
grew
so
near
home
the
grapes
had
all
been
cut
there
was
to
be
quite
a
party
at
ventnor
in
the
evening
of
new
day
ellen
knew
this
and
destined
her
precious
flowers
for
adornment
how
to
keep
them
in
the
meanwhile
she
consulted
john
and
according
to
his
advice
took
them
to
mrs
bland
the
housekeeper
to
be
put
in
water
and
kept
in
a
safe
place
for
her
till
the
time
she
knew
mrs
bland
for
ellen
chauncey
and
she
had
often
gone
to
her
room
to
work
where
none
of
the
children
would
find
and
trouble
them
mrs
bland
promised
to
take
famous
care
of
the
flowers
and
said
she
would
do
it
with
the
greatest
pleasure
marshman
guests
she
added
smilingly
must
have
everything
they
wanted
what
does
that
mean
mrs
bland
said
ellen
why
you
see
miss
ellen
there
a
deal
of
company
always
coming
and
some
is
gillespie
friends
and
some
howard
and
some
to
see
miss
sophia
more
particularly
and
some
belong
to
marshman
or
the
whole
family
maybe
but
now
and
then
marshman
has
an
old
english
friend
or
so
that
he
sets
the
greatest
store
by
and
them
he
calls
guests
and
the
best
in
the
house
is
hardly
good
enough
for
them
or
the
country
either
and
so
i
am
one
of
marshman
guests
said
ellen
i
did
know
what
it
meant
she
saved
but
one
little
piece
of
from
her
flowers
for
the
gratification
of
her
own
nose
and
skipped
away
through
the
hall
to
rejoin
her
companions
very
indeed
chapter
xxxii
this
life
sae
far
i
understand
is
a
enchanted
where
pleasure
is
the
magic
wand
that
wielded
right
makes
hours
like
minutes
hand
in
hand
dance
in
fu
light
burns
new
year
morning
dawned
how
i
wish
breakfast
was
over
thought
ellen
as
she
was
dressing
however
there
is
no
way
of
getting
this
life
but
by
going
through
it
so
when
the
bell
rang
she
went
down
as
usual
marshman
had
decreed
that
he
would
not
have
a
confusion
of
gifts
at
the
other
people
might
make
presents
in
their
own
way
they
must
not
interfere
with
his
bags
and
so
forth
must
therefore
wait
another
opportunity
and
ellen
chauncey
decided
it
would
just
make
the
pleasure
so
much
longer
and
was
a
great
improvement
on
the
old
plan
happy
new
years
and
pleasant
greetings
were
exchanged
as
the
party
gathered
in
the
pleasure
sat
on
all
faces
except
ellen
and
many
a
one
wore
a
broad
smile
as
they
sat
down
to
table
for
the
napkins
were
in
singular
disarrangement
this
morning
instead
of
being
neatly
folded
up
on
the
plates
in
their
usual
fashion
they
were
in
all
sorts
of
disorder
sticking
up
in
curious
angles
some
high
some
low
some
half
folded
some
quite
unfolded
according
to
the
size
and
shape
of
that
which
they
covered
it
was
worth
while
to
see
that
long
tableful
and
the
faces
of
the
company
before
yet
a
napkin
was
touched
an
anxious
glance
at
her
own
showed
ellen
that
it
lay
quite
flat
alice
which
was
next
had
an
odd
little
rising
in
the
middle
as
if
there
were
a
small
dumpling
under
it
ellen
was
in
an
agony
for
this
pause
to
come
to
an
end
it
was
broken
by
some
of
the
older
persons
and
then
in
a
trice
every
plate
was
uncovered
and
then
what
a
buzz
pleasure
and
thanks
and
admiration
and
even
laughter
ellen
dreaded
at
first
to
look
at
her
plate
she
bethought
her
however
that
if
she
waited
long
she
would
have
to
do
it
with
all
eyes
upon
her
she
lifted
the
napkin
slowly
yes
just
as
she
feared
there
lay
a
clean
of
what
value
she
could
not
see
for
confusion
covered
her
the
blood
rushed
to
her
cheeks
and
the
tears
to
her
eyes
she
could
not
have
spoken
and
happily
it
was
no
time
then
everybody
else
was
speaking
she
could
not
have
been
heard
she
had
time
to
cool
and
recollect
herself
but
she
sat
with
her
eyes
cast
down
fastened
upon
her
plate
and
the
unfortunate
which
she
detested
with
all
her
heart
she
did
not
know
what
alice
had
received
she
understood
nothing
that
was
going
on
till
alice
touched
her
and
said
gently
marshman
is
speaking
to
you
ellen
sir
said
ellen
starting
you
need
not
look
so
terrified
said
marshman
smiling
i
only
asked
you
if
your
bill
was
a
counterfeit
something
seems
to
be
wrong
about
it
ellen
looked
at
her
plate
and
hesitated
her
lip
trembled
what
is
it
continued
the
old
gentleman
is
anything
the
matter
ellen
desperately
took
up
the
bill
and
with
burning
cheeks
marched
to
his
end
of
the
table
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
sir
but
i
had
a
great
deal
rather
not
if
you
please
if
you
will
please
to
be
so
good
as
to
let
me
give
it
back
to
you
i
should
be
very
glad
why
hoity
toity
said
the
old
gentleman
what
all
this
what
the
matter
do
you
like
it
i
thought
i
was
doing
the
very
thing
that
would
please
you
best
of
all
i
am
very
sorry
you
should
think
so
sir
said
ellen
who
had
recovered
a
little
breath
but
had
the
greatest
difficulty
to
keep
back
her
tears
i
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
as
your
giving
me
anything
sir
till
somebody
spoke
of
it
and
i
had
rather
never
have
anything
in
the
world
than
that
you
should
think
what
you
thought
about
me
what
did
i
think
about
you
george
told
me
that
somebody
told
you
sir
i
wanted
money
for
my
present
and
did
you
say
so
indeed
i
did
sir
said
ellen
with
sudden
fire
i
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
what
you
say
then
margaret
was
showing
us
her
and
she
asked
me
if
i
like
to
have
some
like
them
and
i
could
help
thinking
i
would
a
great
deal
rather
have
the
money
they
would
cost
to
buy
something
for
alice
and
just
when
i
said
so
you
came
in
sir
and
she
said
what
she
did
i
was
very
much
ashamed
i
was
thinking
of
you
sir
at
all
nor
of
new
year
then
you
would
like
something
else
better
than
money
no
sir
nothing
at
all
if
you
please
if
you
only
be
so
good
as
not
to
give
me
this
i
will
be
very
much
obliged
to
you
indeed
and
please
not
to
think
i
could
be
so
shameful
as
you
thought
i
was
ellen
face
was
not
to
be
withstood
the
old
gentleman
took
the
bill
from
her
hand
i
will
never
think
anything
of
you
said
he
but
what
is
the
very
of
honourable
propriety
but
you
make
ashamed
now
what
am
i
going
to
do
with
this
here
have
you
come
and
made
me
a
present
and
i
feel
very
awkward
indeed
i
do
care
what
you
do
with
it
sir
said
ellen
laughing
though
in
imminent
danger
of
bursting
into
tears
i
am
very
glad
it
is
out
of
hands
but
you
need
think
i
am
going
to
let
you
off
so
said
he
you
must
give
me
kisses
at
least
to
prove
that
you
have
forgiven
me
for
making
so
great
a
blunder
is
too
many
at
once
said
ellen
gaily
three
now
and
three
so
she
gave
the
old
gentleman
three
kisses
but
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
gave
her
a
dozen
at
least
after
which
he
found
out
that
the
waiter
was
holding
a
cup
of
coffee
at
his
elbow
and
ellen
went
back
to
her
place
with
a
very
good
appetite
for
her
breakfast
after
breakfast
the
were
delivered
both
gave
the
most
entire
satisfaction
chauncey
assured
her
daughter
that
she
would
quite
as
lief
have
a
yellow
as
a
red
rose
on
the
cover
and
that
she
liked
the
inscription
extremely
which
the
little
girl
acknowledged
to
have
been
a
joint
device
of
her
own
and
ellen
ellen
bag
gave
great
delight
and
was
paraded
all
over
the
house
after
the
bustle
of
thanks
and
rejoicing
was
at
last
over
and
when
she
had
a
minute
to
herself
which
ellen
chauncey
did
not
give
her
for
a
good
while
ellen
bethought
her
of
her
flowers
a
sweet
gift
still
to
be
made
why
not
make
it
now
why
should
not
alice
have
the
pleasure
of
them
all
day
a
bright
thought
ellen
ran
forthwith
to
the
room
and
after
a
long
admiring
look
at
her
treasures
carried
them
glass
and
all
to
the
library
where
alice
and
john
often
were
in
the
morning
alone
alice
thanked
her
in
the
way
she
liked
best
and
then
the
flowers
were
smelled
and
admired
afresh
nothing
could
have
been
pleasanter
to
me
ellie
except
gift
and
what
was
that
alice
i
have
seen
it
yet
alice
pulled
out
of
her
pocket
a
small
round
morocco
case
the
very
thing
that
ellen
had
thought
looked
like
a
dumpling
under
the
napkin
and
opened
it
it
mr
john
exclaimed
ellen
oh
how
beautiful
neither
of
her
hearers
could
help
laughing
it
is
very
fine
ellie
said
alice
you
are
quite
right
now
i
know
what
was
the
business
that
took
john
to
randolph
every
day
and
kept
him
there
so
long
while
i
was
wondering
at
him
unspeakably
kind
kind
mr
marshman
did
john
get
anything
ask
him
ellie
did
you
get
anything
mr
john
said
ellen
going
up
to
him
where
he
was
reading
on
the
sofa
i
got
this
said
john
handing
her
a
little
book
which
lay
beside
him
what
is
this
wime
wiem
life
of
washington
washington
he
was
may
i
look
at
it
certainly
she
opened
the
book
and
presently
sat
down
on
the
floor
where
she
was
by
the
side
of
the
sofa
whatever
she
had
found
within
the
leaves
of
the
book
she
had
certainly
lost
herself
an
hour
passed
ellen
had
not
spoken
or
moved
except
to
turn
over
leaves
ellen
said
john
she
looked
up
her
cheeks
coloured
high
what
have
you
found
there
said
he
smiling
oh
a
great
deal
but
did
marshman
give
you
this
no
oh
said
ellen
looking
puzzled
i
thought
you
said
you
got
this
this
morning
no
i
got
it
last
night
i
got
it
for
you
ellie
for
me
said
ellen
her
colour
deepening
very
much
for
me
did
you
oh
thank
you
oh
i
so
very
much
obliged
to
you
mr
john
it
is
only
an
answer
to
one
of
your
questions
this
is
it
i
do
know
what
i
am
sure
oh
i
wish
i
could
do
something
to
please
you
mr
john
you
shall
ellie
you
shall
give
me
a
brother
right
again
blushingly
ellen
approached
her
lips
to
receive
one
of
his
grave
kisses
and
then
not
at
all
displeased
went
down
on
the
floor
and
was
lost
in
her
book
oh
the
long
joy
of
that
new
year
day
how
shall
it
be
told
the
pleasure
of
that
delightful
book
in
which
she
was
wrapped
the
whole
day
even
when
called
off
as
she
often
was
by
ellen
chauncey
to
help
her
in
fifty
little
matters
of
business
or
pleasure
these
were
attended
to
and
faithfully
and
cheerfully
but
was
in
her
head
all
the
while
and
this
pleasure
was
mixed
with
alice
pleasure
the
flowers
and
the
miniature
and
marshman
restored
kindness
she
never
met
john
or
alice
eye
that
day
without
a
smile
even
when
she
went
to
be
dressed
her
book
went
with
her
and
was
laid
on
the
bed
within
sight
ready
to
be
taken
up
the
moment
she
was
at
liberty
ellen
chauncey
lent
her
a
white
frock
which
was
found
to
answer
very
well
with
a
tuck
let
out
and
alice
herself
dressed
her
while
this
was
doing
margaret
dunscombe
put
her
head
in
at
the
door
to
ask
anne
miss
sophia
maid
if
she
was
almost
ready
to
come
and
curl
her
hair
indeed
i
ca
say
that
i
am
miss
margaret
said
anne
something
to
do
for
miss
humphreys
and
miss
sophia
has
so
much
as
done
the
first
thing
towards
beginning
to
get
ready
yet
it
be
a
good
hour
and
more
margaret
went
away
exclaiming
impatiently
that
she
could
get
nobody
to
help
her
and
would
have
to
wait
till
everybody
was
downstairs
a
few
minutes
after
she
heard
ellen
voice
at
the
door
of
her
room
asking
if
she
might
come
in
yes
what
that
what
do
you
want
i
fix
your
hair
if
you
let
me
said
ellen
you
i
do
believe
you
can
oh
yes
i
can
i
used
to
do
mamma
very
often
i
am
not
afraid
if
you
trust
me
well
thank
you
i
do
care
if
you
try
then
said
margaret
seating
herself
it
wo
do
any
harm
at
any
rate
and
i
want
to
be
downstairs
before
anybody
gets
here
i
think
it
half
the
fun
to
see
them
come
in
bless
me
you
dressed
and
all
ready
margaret
hair
was
in
long
thick
curls
it
was
not
a
trifling
matter
to
dress
them
ellen
plodded
through
it
patiently
and
faithfully
taking
great
pains
and
doing
the
work
well
and
then
went
back
to
alice
margaret
thanks
not
very
gracefully
given
would
have
been
a
poor
reward
for
the
loss
of
of
an
hour
of
pleasure
but
ellen
was
very
happy
in
having
done
right
it
was
no
longer
time
to
read
they
must
go
downstairs
the
new
year
party
was
a
nondescript
young
and
old
together
a
goodly
number
of
both
were
gathered
from
randolph
and
the
neighbouring
country
there
were
games
for
the
young
dancing
for
the
gay
and
a
superb
supper
for
all
and
the
big
bright
rooms
were
full
of
bright
faces
it
was
a
very
happy
evening
to
ellen
for
a
good
part
of
it
marshman
took
possession
of
her
or
kept
her
near
him
and
his
extreme
kindness
would
alone
have
made
the
evening
pass
pleasantly
she
was
sure
he
was
her
firm
friend
again
in
the
course
of
the
evening
chauncey
found
occasion
to
ask
her
about
her
journey
up
the
river
without
at
all
mentioning
margaret
or
what
she
had
said
ellen
answered
that
she
had
come
with
dunscombe
and
her
daughter
did
you
have
a
pleasant
time
asked
chauncey
why
no
said
ellen
i
do
know
it
was
partly
pleasant
and
partly
unpleasant
what
made
it
so
love
i
had
left
mamma
that
morning
and
that
made
me
unhappy
but
you
said
it
was
partly
pleasant
oh
that
was
because
i
had
such
a
good
friend
on
board
said
ellen
her
face
lighting
up
as
his
image
came
before
her
who
was
that
i
do
know
who
he
was
a
stranger
to
you
yes
i
never
saw
him
before
i
wish
i
could
see
him
again
where
did
you
find
him
i
did
find
him
he
found
me
when
i
was
sitting
up
on
the
highest
part
of
the
boat
and
your
friends
with
you
what
friends
dunscombe
and
her
daughter
no
they
were
down
in
the
cabin
and
what
business
had
you
to
be
walking
about
the
boat
alone
said
marshman
they
were
strangers
sir
said
ellen
colouring
a
little
well
so
was
this
man
your
friend
a
stranger
too
was
he
oh

was
a
very
different
stranger
said
ellen
smiling
and
he
was
a
stranger
long
besides
well
you
must
tell
me
more
about
him

i
curious
what
sort
of
a
strange
friend

a
friend

ellen
laughing
he
was
a
very
very
good
friend
he
took
care
of
me
the
whole
day
he
was
very
good
and
very
kind
what
kind
of
a
man
said
chauncey
a
gentleman
oh
yes
said
ellen
looking
surprised
at
the
question
i
am
sure
he
was
what
did
he
look
like
ellen
tried
to
tell
but
the
portrait
was
not
very
distinct
what
did
he
wear
coat
or
cloak
coat
dark
brown
i
think
this
was
in
the
end
of
october
was
it
ellen
thought
a
moment
and
answered
yes
and
you
do
know
his
name
no
i
wish
i
did
i
can
tell
you
said
chauncey
smiling
he
is
one
of
my
best
friends
too
ellen
it
is
my
brother
george
marshman
how
ellen
face
crimsoned
marshman
asked
how
she
knew
it
was
then
he
came
up
the
river
you
know
sir
and
do
you
remember
his
speaking
of
a
little
girl
on
board
the
boat
who
was
travelling
with
strangers
and
whom
he
endeavoured
to
befriend
i
had
forgotten
it
entirely
till
a
minute
or
two
ago
miss
margaret
dunscombe
cried
george
walsh
what
kind
of
a
person
was
that
you
said
ellen
was
so
fond
of
when
you
came
up
the
river
i
do
know
nor
care
said
margaret
somebody
she
picked
up
somewhere
it
was
george
marshman
it
was
uncle
george
exclaimed
ellen
chauncey
running
up
to
the
group
her
cousin
had
quitted
uncle
george
do
you
know
uncle
george
ellen
very
much
i
mean
yes
said
ellen
ellen
chauncey
was
delighted
so
was
ellen
montgomery
it
seemed
to
bring
the
whole
family
nearer
to
her
and
they
felt
it
too
marshman
kissed
her
when
she
heard
it
and
said
she
remembered
very
well
her
son
speaking
of
her
and
was
very
glad
to
find
who
it
was
and
now
ellen
thought
she
would
surely
see
him
again
some
time
the
next
day
they
left
ventnor
ellen
chauncey
was
very
sorry
to
lose
her
new
friend
and
begged
she
would
come
again
as
soon
as
she
could
all
the
family
said
the
same
marshman
told
her
she
must
give
him
a
large
place
in
her
heart
or
he
should
be
jealous
of
her
strange
friend
and
alice
was
charged
to
bring
her
whenever
she
came
to
see
them
the
drive
back
to
was
scarcely
less
pleasant
than
the
drive
out
had
been
and
home
ellen
said
looked
lovely
that
is
home
which
she
began
to
think
more
her
own
than
any
other
the
pleasure
of
the
past
ten
days
though
great
had
not
been
unmixed
the
week
that
followed
was
one
of
perfect
enjoyment
in
humphrey
household
there
was
an
atmosphere
of
peace
and
purity
that
even
a
child
could
feel
and
in
which
such
a
child
as
ellen
throve
exceedingly
the
drawing
lessons
went
on
with
great
success
other
lessons
were
begun
there
were
fine
long
walks
and
charming
and
more
than
one
visit
to
vawse
and
what
ellen
perhaps
liked
best
of
all
the
long
evenings
of
conversation
and
reading
aloud
and
bright
firelights
and
brighter
sympathy
and
intelligence
and
affection
that
week
did
them
all
good
and
no
one
more
than
ellen
it
was
a
little
hard
to
go
back
to
miss
fortune
and
begin
her
old
life
there
she
went
on
the
evening
of
the
day
john
had
departed
they
were
at
supper
well
said
miss
fortune
as
ellen
entered
have
you
got
enough
of
visiting
i
should
be
ashamed
to
go
where
i
was
wanted
for
my
part
i
have
aunt
fortune
said
ellen
she
been
nowhere
but
what
done
her
good
said
van
brunt
she
reely
growed
handsome
since
she
been
away
grown
a
fiddlestick
said
miss
fortune
she
could
grow
handsomer
than
she
was
before
said
the
old
grandmother
hugging
and
kissing
her
little
granddaughter
with
great
delight
the
sweetest
posie
in
the
garden
she
always
was
van
brunt
looked
as
if
he
entirely
agreed
with
the
old
lady
that
while
it
made
some
amends
for
miss
fortune
dryness
perhaps
increased
it
she
remarked
that
she
thanked
heaven
she
could
always
make
herself
contented
at
home
which
ellen
could
not
help
thinking
was
a
happiness
for
the
rest
of
the
world
in
the
matter
of
the
collar
it
was
hard
to
say
whether
the
giver
or
receiver
had
the
most
satisfaction
ellen
had
begged
him
not
to
speak
of
it
to
her
aunt
and
accordingly
one
sunday
when
he
came
there
with
it
on
both
he
and
she
were
in
a
state
of
exquisite
delight
miss
attention
was
at
last
aroused
she
made
a
particular
review
of
him
and
ended
it
by
declaring
that
he
looked
uncommonly
dandified
but
she
could
not
make
out
what
he
had
done
to
himself
a
remark
which
transported
van
brunt
and
ellen
beyond
all
bounds
of
prudence
nancy
bible
which
had
been
purchased
for
her
at
randolph
was
given
to
her
the
first
opportunity
ellen
anxiously
watched
her
as
she
slowly
turned
it
over
her
face
showing
however
very
decided
approbation
of
the
style
of
the
gift
she
shook
her
head
once
or
twice
and
then
said
what
did
you
give
this
to
me
for
ellen
because
i
wanted
to
give
you
something
for
new
year
said
ellen
and
i
thought
that
would
be
the
best
thing
if
you
would
only
read
it
it
would
make
you
so
happy
and
good
are
good
i
believe
said
nancy
but
i
do
expect
ever
to
be
myself
i
do
think
i
be
you
might
as
well
teach
a
snake
not
to
wriggle
i
am
not
good
at
all
said
ellen
we
none
of
us
good
and
the
tears
rose
to
her
eyes
but
the
bible
will
teach
us
how
to
be
if
you
only
read
it
please
nancy
do
say
you
will
read
a
little
every
day
you
do
want
me
to
make
a
promise
i
should
keep
i
guess
do
you
no
said
ellen
well
i
should
keep
that
so
i
wo
promise
it
but
i
tell
you
what
i
do
i
take
precious
fine
care
of
it
and
keep
it
always
for
your
sake
well
said
ellen
sighing
i
am
glad
you
will
even
do
so
much
as
that
but
nancy
before
you
begin
to
read
the
bible
you
may
have
to
go
where
you
never
can
read
it
nor
be
happy
nor
good
neither
nancy
made
no
answer
but
walked
away
ellen
thought
rather
more
soberly
than
usual
this
conversation
had
cost
ellen
some
effort
it
had
not
been
made
without
a
good
deal
of
thought
and
some
prayer
she
could
not
hope
she
had
done
much
good
but
she
had
done
her
duty
and
it
happened
that
van
brunt
standing
behind
the
angle
of
the
wall
had
heard
every
word
chapter
xxxiii
if
erst
he
wished
now
he
longed
sore
fairfax
ellen
life
had
nothing
to
mark
it
for
many
months
the
rest
of
the
winter
passed
quietly
away
every
day
being
full
of
employment
at
home
the
state
of
matters
was
rather
bettered
either
miss
fortune
was
softened
by
ellen
gentle
inoffensive
ways
and
obedient
usefulness
or
she
had
resolved
to
bear
what
could
not
be
helped
and
make
the
best
of
the
little
inmate
she
could
not
get
rid
of
she
was
certainly
resolved
to
make
the
of
her
ellen
was
kept
on
the
jump
a
great
deal
of
the
time
she
was
runner
of
errands
and
to
set
the
table
and
clear
it
was
only
a
trifle
in
the
list
of
her
everyday
duties
and
they
were
not
ended
till
the
last
supper
dish
was
put
away
and
the
hearth
swept
up
miss
fortune
never
spared
herself
and
never
spared
ellen
so
long
as
she
had
any
occasion
for
her
there
were
however
long
pieces
of
time
that
were
left
free
these
ellen
seized
for
her
studies
and
used
most
diligently
urged
on
by
a
three
or
fourfold
motive
for
the
love
of
them
and
for
her
own
sake
that
john
might
think
she
had
done
well
that
she
might
presently
please
and
satisfy
alice
above
all
that
her
mother
wishes
might
be
answered
this
thought
whenever
it
came
was
a
spur
to
her
efforts
so
was
each
of
the
others
and
christian
feeling
added
another
and
kept
all
the
rest
in
force
without
this
indolence
might
have
weakened
or
temptation
surprised
her
resolution
little
ellen
was
open
to
both
but
if
ever
she
found
herself
growing
careless
from
either
cause
conscience
was
sure
to
smite
her
and
then
would
rush
in
all
the
motives
that
called
upon
her
to
persevere
soon
faithfulness
began
to
bring
its
reward
with
delight
she
found
herself
getting
the
better
of
difficulties
beginning
to
see
a
little
through
the
mists
of
ignorance
making
some
sensible
progress
on
the
long
road
of
learning
study
grew
delightful
her
lessons
with
alice
one
of
her
greatest
enjoyments
and
as
they
were
a
labour
of
love
to
both
teacher
and
scholar
and
as
it
was
the
aim
of
each
to
see
quite
to
the
bottom
of
every
matter
where
it
was
possible
and
to
leave
no
difficulties
behind
them
on
the
road
which
they
had
not
cleared
away
no
wonder
ellen
went
forward
steadily
and
rapidly
reading
also
became
a
wonderful
pleasure
wiem
life
of
washington
was
read
and
read
and
read
over
again
till
she
almost
knew
it
by
heart
and
from
that
she
went
to
alice
library
and
ransacked
it
for
what
would
suit
her
happily
it
was
a
one
and
ellen
could
not
light
upon
many
books
that
would
do
her
mischief
for
those
alice
wish
was
enough
she
never
opened
them
furthermore
alice
insisted
that
when
ellen
had
only
fairly
begun
a
book
she
should
go
through
with
it
not
capriciously
leave
it
for
another
nor
have
about
at
one
time
but
when
ellen
had
read
it
once
she
commonly
wanted
to
go
over
it
again
and
seldom
laid
it
aside
until
she
had
sucked
the
sweetness
all
out
of
it
as
for
drawing
it
could
not
go
on
very
fast
while
the
cold
weather
lasted
ellen
had
no
place
at
home
where
she
could
spread
out
her
paper
and
copies
without
danger
of
being
disturbed
her
only
chance
was
at
the
parsonage
john
had
put
all
her
pencils
in
order
before
he
went
and
had
left
her
an
abundance
of
copies
marked
as
she
was
to
take
them
they
or
some
of
them
were
bestowed
in
alice
desk
and
whenever
ellen
had
a
spare
hour
or
two
of
a
fine
morning
or
afternoon
she
made
the
best
of
her
way
to
the
mountain
it
made
no
difference
whether
alice
were
at
home
or
not
she
went
in
coaxed
up
the
fire
and
began
her
work
it
happened
many
a
time
that
alice
coming
home
from
a
walk
or
a
run
in
the
woods
saw
the
little
hood
and
cloak
on
the
settee
before
she
opened
the
glass
door
and
knew
very
well
how
she
should
find
ellen
bending
intently
over
her
desk
these
runs
to
the
mountain
were
very
frequent
sometimes
to
draw
sometimes
to
recite
always
to
see
alice
and
be
happy
ellen
grew
rosy
and
hardy
and
in
spite
of
her
separation
from
her
mother
she
was
very
happy
too
her
extreme
and
varied
occupation
made
this
possible
she
had
no
time
to
indulge
useless
sorrow
on
the
contrary
her
thoughts
were
taken
up
with
agreeable
matters
either
doing
or
to
be
done
and
at
night
she
was
far
too
tired
and
sleepy
to
lie
awake
musing
and
besides
she
hoped
that
her
mother
would
come
back
in
the
spring
or
the
summer
at
farthest
it
is
true
ellen
had
no
liking
for
the
kind
of
business
her
aunt
gave
her
it
was
oftentimes
a
trial
of
temper
and
patience
miss
fortune
was
not
the
pleasantest
in
the
world
and
ellen
was
apt
to
wish
to
be
doing
something
else
but
after
all
this
was
not
amiss
besides
the
discipline
of
character
these
trials
made
the
pleasant
things
with
which
they
were
mixed
up
seem
doubly
pleasant
the
disagreeable
parts
of
her
life
relished
the
agreeable
wonderfully
after
spending
the
whole
morning
with
miss
fortune
in
the
depths
of
housework
how
delightful
it
was
to
forget
all
in
drawing
some
nice
little
cottage
with
a
bit
of
stone
wall
and
a
barrel
in
front
or
to
go
with
alice
in
thought
to
the
south
of
france
and
learn
how
the
peasants
manage
their
vines
and
make
the
wine
from
them
or
run
over
the
rock
of
gibraltar
with
the
monkeys
or
at
another
time
seated
on
a
little
bench
in
the
chimney
corner
when
the
fire
blazed
up
well
before
the
candles
were
lighted
to
forget
the
kitchen
and
the
supper
and
her
bustling
aunt
and
sail
round
the
world
with
captain
cook
yes
these
things
were
all
the
sweeter
for
being
tasted
by
snatches
spring
brought
new
occupation
household
labours
began
to
increase
in
number
and
measure
her
leisure
times
were
shortened
but
pleasures
were
increased
too
when
the
snow
went
off
and
days
began
to
come
and
birds
notes
were
heard
again
and
the
trees
put
out
their
young
leaves
and
the
brown
mountains
were
looking
soft
and
green
ellen
heart
bounded
at
the
sight
the
springing
grass
was
lovely
to
see
dandelions
were
marvels
of
beauty
to
her
each
wild
wood
flower
was
a
admired
and
loved
wonder
she
used
to
take
long
rambles
with
van
brunt
when
business
led
him
to
the
woods
sometimes
riding
part
of
the
way
on
the
always
a
basket
for
flowers
went
along
and
when
the
sled
stopped
she
would
wander
all
around
seeking
among
the
dead
leaves
for
the
white
and
pretty
little
uvularia
and
delicate
and
the
wild
geranium
and
columbine
and
many
others
the
names
of
which
she
did
not
know
they
were
like
friends
to
ellen
she
gathered
them
affectionately
as
well
as
admiringly
into
her
little
basket
and
seemed
to
purify
herself
in
their
pure
companionship
even
van
brunt
came
to
have
an
indistinct
notion
that
ellen
and
flowers
were
made
to
be
together
after
he
found
what
a
pleasure
it
was
to
her
to
go
on
these
expeditions
he
made
it
a
point
whenever
he
was
bound
to
the
woods
of
a
fine
day
to
come
to
the
house
for
her
miss
fortune
might
object
as
she
pleased
he
always
found
an
answer
and
at
last
ellen
to
her
great
joy
would
be
told
well
go
get
your
bonnet
and
be
off
with
yourself
once
under
the
shadow
of
the
big
trees
the
dried
leaves
crackling
beneath
her
feet
and
alone
with
her
kind
conductor
and
miss
fortune
and
all
in
the
world
that
was
disagreeable
was
forgotten
forgotten
no
more
to
be
remembered
till
the
walk
should
come
to
an
end
and
it
would
have
surprised
anybody
to
hear
the
long
conversations
she
and
van
brunt
kept
up
he
the
silentest
man
in
thirlwall
their
talk
often
ran
upon
trees
among
which
van
brunt
was
at
home
ellen
wanted
to
become
acquainted
with
them
as
well
as
with
the
little
flowers
that
grew
at
their
feet
and
he
tried
to
teach
her
how
to
know
each
separate
kind
by
the
bark
and
leaf
and
manner
of
growth
the
pine
and
hemlock
and
fir
were
easily
learnt
the
white
birch
too
beyond
those
at
first
she
was
perpetually
confounding
one
with
another
van
brunt
had
to
go
over
and
over
his
instructions
never
weary
always
vastly
amused
pleasant
lessons
these
were
ellen
thought
so
and
van
brunt
thought
so
too
then
there
were
walks
with
alice
pleasanter
still
if
that
could
be
and
even
in
the
house
ellen
managed
to
keep
a
token
of
on
her
the
three
uncouth
legs
of
which
were
now
hidden
by
a
neat
dimity
cover
there
always
stood
a
broken
tumbler
with
a
supply
of
flowers
the
supply
was
very
varied
it
is
true
sometimes
only
a
handful
of
dandelions
sometimes
a
huge
bunch
of
lilac
flowers
which
could
not
be
persuaded
to
stay
in
the
glass
without
the
help
of
the
wall
against
which
it
leaned
in
very
undignified
style
sometimes
the
bouquet
was
of
really
delicate
and
beautiful
wild
flowers
all
were
charming
in
ellen
eyes
as
the
days
grew
long
and
the
weather
warm
alice
and
she
began
to
make
frequent
trips
to
the
cat
back
and
french
came
very
much
into
fashion
they
generally
took
sharp
to
ease
the
long
way
and
rested
themselves
with
a
good
stay
on
the
mountain
their
coming
was
always
a
joy
to
the
old
lady
she
was
dearly
fond
of
them
both
and
delighted
to
hear
from
their
lips
the
language
she
loved
best
after
a
time
they
spoke
nothing
else
when
with
her
she
was
well
qualified
to
teach
them
and
indeed
her
general
education
had
been
far
from
contemptible
though
nature
had
done
more
for
her
as
the
language
grew
familiar
to
them
she
loved
to
tell
and
they
to
hear
long
stories
of
her
youth
and
native
country
scenes
and
people
so
very
different
from
all
ellen
had
ever
seen
or
heard
of
and
told
in
a
lively
simple
style
which
she
could
not
have
given
in
english
and
with
a
sweet
colouring
of
christian
thought
and
feeling
many
things
made
these
visits
good
and
pleasant
it
was
not
the
least
of
alice
and
ellen
joy
to
carry
their
old
friend
something
that
might
be
for
her
comfort
in
her
lonely
way
of
life
for
even
miss
fortune
now
and
then
told
ellen
she
might
take
a
piece
of
that
cheese
along
with
her
or
she
wondered
if
the
old
lady
would
like
a
little
fresh
meat
she
guessed
she
cut
her
a
bit
of
that
nice
lamb
she
would
want
but
a
little
piece
a
singular
testimony
this
was
to
the
respect
and
esteem
vawse
had
from
everybody
miss
fortune
very
very
seldom
was
known
to
take
a
bit
from
her
own
comforts
to
add
to
those
of
another
the
ruling
passion
of
this
lady
was
thrift
her
next
good
housewifery
first
to
gather
to
herself
and
heap
up
of
what
the
world
most
esteems
after
that
to
be
known
as
the
most
thorough
housekeeper
and
the
smartest
woman
in
thirlwall
ellen
made
other
visits
she
did
not
like
so
well
in
the
course
of
the
winter
and
summer
she
became
acquainted
with
most
of
the
neighbourhood
she
sometimes
went
with
her
aunt
to
a
formal
one
two
three
or
four
miles
off
as
the
case
might
be
they
were
not
very
pleasant
to
some
places
she
was
asked
by
herself
and
though
the
people
invariably
showed
themselves
very
kind
and
did
their
best
to
please
her
ellen
seldom
cared
to
go
a
second
time
liked
even
home
and
miss
fortune
better
there
were
a
few
exceptions
jenny
hitchcock
was
one
of
her
favourites
and
jane
huff
was
another
and
all
of
their
respective
families
came
in
with
good
reason
for
a
share
of
her
regard
juniper
indeed
excepted
once
they
went
to
a
quilting
at
squire
dennison
the
house
was
spotlessly
neat
and
well
ordered
the
people
all
kind
but
ellen
thought
they
did
not
seem
to
know
how
to
be
pleasant
dan
dennison
alone
had
no
stiffness
about
him
miss
fortune
remarked
with
pride
that
even
in
this
family
of
pretension
as
she
thought
it
the
refreshments
could
bear
no
comparison
with
hers
once
they
were
invited
to
tea
at
the
lawsons
but
ellen
told
alice
with
much
apparent
disgust
that
she
never
wanted
to
go
again
van
brunt
she
saw
often
to
thirlwall
miss
fortune
never
went
twice
in
the
course
of
the
summer
ellen
had
a
very
great
pleasure
in
the
company
of
little
ellen
chauncey
once
miss
sophia
brought
her
and
once
her
mother
and
the
last
time
they
made
a
visit
of
two
weeks
on
both
occasions
ellen
was
sent
for
to
the
parsonage
and
kept
while
they
stayed
and
the
pleasure
that
she
and
her
little
friend
had
together
can
not
be
told
it
was
unmixed
now
rambling
about
through
the
woods
and
over
the
fields
no
matter
where
it
was
all
enchanting
helping
alice
garden
helping
thomas
make
hay
and
the
mischief
they
did
his
haycocks
by
tumbling
upon
them
and
the
patience
with
which
he
bore
it
the
looking
for
eggs
the
helping
margery
churn
and
the
helping
each
other
set
tables
the
pleasant
mornings
and
pleasant
evenings
and
pleasant
it
can
not
be
told
long
to
be
remembered
sweet
and
pure
was
the
pleasure
of
those
summer
days
unclouded
by
a
shade
of
discontent
or
disagreement
on
either
brow
ellen
loved
the
whole
marshman
family
now
for
the
sake
of
one
the
one
she
had
first
known
and
little
ellen
chauncey
repeatedly
told
her
mother
in
private
that
ellen
montgomery
was
the
very
nicest
girl
she
had
ever
seen
they
met
with
joy
and
parted
with
sorrow
entreating
and
promising
if
possible
a
speedy
meeting
again
amidst
all
the
improvements
and
enjoyments
of
these
summer
months
and
they
had
a
great
deal
of
both
for
ellen
there
was
one
cause
of
sorrow
she
could
not
help
feeling
and
it
began
to
press
more
and
more
letters
they
came
slowly
and
when
they
came
they
were
not
at
all
satisfactory
those
in
her
mother
hand
dwindled
and
dwindled
till
at
last
there
came
only
mere
scraps
of
letters
from
her
and
sometimes
after
a
long
interval
one
from
captain
montgomery
would
come
alone
ellen
heart
sickened
with
hope
she
wondered
what
could
make
her
mother
neglect
a
matter
so
necessary
for
her
happiness
sometimes
she
fancied
they
were
travelling
about
and
it
might
be
inconvenient
to
write
sometimes
she
thought
perhaps
they
were
coming
home
without
letting
her
know
and
would
suddenly
surprise
her
some
day
and
make
her
half
lose
her
wits
with
joy
but
they
did
not
come
nor
write
and
whatever
was
the
reason
ellen
felt
it
was
very
sad
and
sadder
and
sadder
as
the
summer
went
on
her
own
letters
became
pitiful
in
their
supplications
for
letters
they
had
been
very
cheerful
and
filled
with
encouraging
matter
and
in
part
they
were
still
for
a
while
her
mind
was
diverted
from
this
sad
subject
and
her
brow
cleared
up
when
john
came
home
in
august
as
before
alice
gained
miss
fortune
leave
to
keep
her
at
the
parsonage
the
whole
time
of
his
stay
which
was
several
weeks
ellen
wondered
that
it
was
so
easily
granted
but
she
was
much
too
happy
to
spend
time
in
thinking
about
it
miss
fortune
had
several
reasons
she
was
unwilling
to
displease
miss
humphreys
and
conscious
that
it
would
be
a
shame
to
her
to
stand
openly
in
the
way
of
ellen
good
besides
though
ellen
services
were
lost
for
a
time
yet
she
said
she
got
tired
of
setting
her
to
work
she
liked
to
dash
round
the
house
alone
without
thinking
what
somebody
else
was
doing
or
ought
to
be
doing
in
short
she
liked
to
have
her
out
of
the
way
for
a
while
furthermore
it
did
not
please
her
that
van
brunt
and
her
little
handmaid
were
as
she
expressed
it
so
thick
his
first
thought
and
his
last
thought
she
said
she
believed
were
for
ellen
whether
she
came
in
or
went
out
and
miss
fortune
was
accustomed
to
be
chief
not
only
in
her
own
house
but
in
the
regards
of
all
who
came
to
it
at
any
rate
the
leave
was
granted
and
ellen
went
and
now
was
repeated
the
pleasure
of
the
first
week
in
january
it
would
have
been
increased
but
that
increase
was
not
possible
there
was
only
the
difference
between
lovely
winter
and
lovely
summer
weather
it
was
seldom
very
hot
in
thirlwall
the
fields
and
hills
were
covered
with
green
instead
of
white
fluttering
leaves
had
taken
the
place
of
sprays
and
sparkling
icicles
and
for
the
keen
north
and
brisk
northwester
soft
summer
airs
were
blowing
ellen
saw
no
other
difference
except
that
perhaps
if
it
could
be
there
was
something
more
of
tenderness
in
the
manner
of
alice
and
her
brother
towards
her
no
little
sister
could
have
been
more
cherished
and
cared
for
if
there
was
a
change
humphreys
shared
it
it
is
true
he
seldom
took
much
part
in
the
conversation
and
seldomer
was
with
them
in
any
of
their
pursuits
or
pleasures
he
generally
kept
by
himself
in
his
study
but
whenever
he
did
speak
to
ellen
his
tone
was
particularly
gentle
and
his
look
kind
he
sometimes
called
her
my
little
daughter
which
always
gave
ellen
great
pleasure
she
would
jump
at
such
times
with
double
zeal
to
do
anything
he
asked
her
now
drawing
went
on
with
new
vigour
under
the
eye
of
her
master
and
many
things
beside
john
took
a
great
deal
of
pains
with
her
in
various
ways
he
made
her
read
to
him
he
helped
her
and
alice
with
their
french
he
went
with
them
to
vawse
and
even
humphreys
went
there
too
one
afternoon
to
tea
how
much
ellen
enjoyed
that
afternoon
they
took
with
them
a
great
basket
of
provisions
for
vawse
could
not
be
expected
to
entertain
so
large
a
party
and
borrowed
jenny
hitchcock
pony
which
with
old
john
and
sharp
mounted
three
of
the
company
they
took
turns
in
walking
nobody
minded
that
the
fine
weather
the
beautiful
the
general
pleasure
humphreys
uncommon
spirits
and
talkableness
the
oddity
of
their
way
of
travelling
and
of
a
up
on
the
cat
back
and
furthermore
the
fact
that
nancy
stayed
at
home
and
behaved
very
well
the
whole
time
all
together
filled
ellen
cup
of
happiness
for
the
time
as
full
as
it
could
hold
she
never
forgot
that
afternoon
and
the
ride
home
was
the
best
of
all
the
sun
was
low
by
the
time
they
reached
the
plain
long
shadows
lay
across
their
road
the
soft
air
just
stirred
the
leaves
on
the
branches
stillness
and
loveliness
were
over
all
things
and
down
the
mountain
and
along
the
roads
through
the
open
country
the
whole
way
john
walked
at
her
bridle
so
kind
in
his
care
of
her
so
pleasant
in
his
talk
to
her
teaching
her
how
to
sit
in
the
saddle
and
hold
the
reins
and
whip
and
much
more
important
things
too
that
ellen
thought
a
pleasanter
thing
could
not
be
than
to
ride
so
after
that
they
took
a
great
many
rides
borrowing
jenny
pony
or
some
other
and
explored
the
beautiful
country
far
and
near
and
almost
daily
john
had
up
sharp
and
gave
ellen
a
regular
lesson
she
often
thought
and
sometimes
looked
what
she
had
once
said
to
him
i
wish
i
could
do
something
for
john
but
he
smiled
and
said
nothing
at
last
he
was
gone
and
in
all
the
week
he
had
been
at
home
and
in
many
weeks
before
no
letter
had
come
for
ellen
the
thought
had
been
kept
from
weighing
upon
her
by
the
thousand
pleasures
that
filled
up
every
moment
of
his
stay
she
could
not
be
sad
then
or
only
for
a
minute
hope
threw
off
the
sorrow
as
soon
as
it
was
felt
and
she
forgot
how
time
flew
but
when
his
visit
was
over
and
she
went
back
to
her
old
place
and
her
old
life
at
her
aunt
the
old
feeling
came
back
in
greater
strength
she
began
again
to
count
the
days
and
the
weeks
to
feel
the
bitter
unsatisfied
longing
tears
would
drop
down
upon
her
bible
tears
streamed
from
her
eyes
when
she
prayed
that
god
would
make
her
mother
well
and
bring
her
home
to
her
quickly
oh
quickly
and
little
ellen
face
began
to
wear
once
more
something
of
its
old
look
chapter
xxxiv
all
was
ended
now
the
hope
and
the
fear
and
the
sorrow
all
the
aching
of
heart
the
restless
unsatisfied
longing
all
the
dull
deep
pain
and
constant
anguish
of
patience
longfellow
one
day
in
the
early
part
of
september
she
was
standing
in
front
of
the
house
at
the
little
wicket
that
opened
on
the
road
with
her
back
against
the
open
gate
she
was
gently
moving
it
to
and
fro
half
enjoying
the
weather
and
the
scene
half
indulging
the
melancholy
mood
which
drove
her
from
the
presence
of
her
bustling
aunt
the
gurgling
sound
of
the
brook
a
few
steps
off
was
a
great
deal
more
soothing
to
her
ear
than
miss
fortune
sharp
tones
a
horseman
came
in
sight
at
the
far
end
of
the
road
and
the
brook
was
forgotten
what
made
ellen
look
at
him
so
sharply
poor
child
she
was
always
expecting
news
at
first
she
could
only
see
that
the
man
rode
a
white
horse
then
as
he
came
nearer
an
odd
hat
showed
itself
and
something
queer
in
his
hand
what
was
it
who
is
it
the
old
newsman
ellen
was
sure
yes
she
could
now
see
his
and
the
white
set
in
a
handle
with
which
he
was
brushing
away
the
flies
from
his
horse
the
tin
trumpet
was
in
his
other
hand
to
blow
withal
he
was
a
venerable
old
figure
with
all
his
oddities
clad
in
a
suit
of
snuff
brown
with
a
neat
quiet
look
about
him
he
and
the
and
the
white
horse
jogged
on
together
as
if
they
belonged
to
nothing
else
in
the
world
but
each
other
in
an
ecstasy
of
fear
and
hope
ellen
watched
the
pace
of
the
old
horse
to
see
if
it
gave
any
sign
of
slackening
near
the
gate
her
breath
came
short
she
hardly
breathed
at
all
she
was
trembling
from
head
to
foot
he
stop
or
was
he
going
on
oh
the
long
agony
of
two
minutes
he
stopped
ellen
went
towards
him
what
little
gal
is
this
said
he
i
am
ellen
montgomery
sir
said
ellen
eagerly
miss
niece
i
live
here
stop
a
bit
said
the
old
man
taking
up
his
miss
fortune
niece
eh
well
i
believe
as
i
got
somethin
for
her
somethin
here
aunt
well
eh
yes
sir
that
more
than
you
be
ai
it
said
he
glancing
sideways
at
ellen
face
how
do
you
know
but
i
got
a
letter
for
you
here
eh
the
colour
rushed
to
that
face
and
she
clasped
her
hands
no
dear
no
said
he
i
got
any
for
you
it
for
the
old
lady
there
run
in
with
it
dear
but
ellen
knew
before
she
touched
it
that
it
was
a
foreign
letter
and
dashed
into
the
house
with
it
miss
fortune
coolly
sent
her
back
to
pay
the
postage
when
she
came
in
again
her
aunt
was
still
reading
the
letter
but
her
look
ellen
was
unpromising
she
did
not
venture
to
speak
expectation
was
chilled
she
stood
till
miss
fortune
began
to
fold
up
the
paper
is
there
nothing
for
me
she
said
then
timidly
no
oh
why
do
she
write
to
me
cried
ellen
bursting
into
tears
miss
fortune
stalked
about
the
room
without
any
particular
purpose
as
far
as
could
be
seen
it
is
very
strange
said
ellen
sorrowfully
i
am
afraid
she
is
worse
does
papa
say
she
is
worse
no
oh
if
she
had
only
sent
me
a
message
i
should
think
she
might
oh
i
wish
she
had
three
words
does
papa
say
why
she
do
write
no
it
is
very
strange
repeated
poor
ellen
your
father
talks
of
coming
home
said
miss
fortune
after
a
few
minutes
during
which
ellen
had
been
silently
weeping
home
then
she
must
be
better
said
ellen
with
new
life
does
papa
say
she
is
better
no
but
what
does
he
mean
said
ellen
uneasily
i
do
see
what
he
means
he
does
say
she
is
worse
and
he
does
say
she
is
better
what
he
say
he
do
say
much
about
anything
does
he
say
when
they
are
coming
home
miss
fortune
mumbled
something
about
spring
and
whisked
off
to
the
buttery
ellen
thought
no
more
was
to
be
got
out
of
her
she
felt
miserable
her
father
and
aunt
both
seemed
to
act
strangely
and
where
to
find
comfort
she
scarcely
knew
she
had
been
one
day
telling
her
doubts
and
sorrows
to
john
he
did
not
try
to
raise
her
hopes
but
said
troubles
will
come
in
this
world
ellie
the
best
is
to
trust
them
and
ourselves
to
our
dear
saviour
and
let
trials
drive
us
to
him
seek
to
love
him
more
and
to
be
patient
under
his
will
the
good
shepherd
means
nothing
but
kindness
to
any
lamb
in
his
flock
you
may
be
sure
of
that
ellie
ellen
remembered
his
words
and
tried
to
follow
them
now
but
she
could
not
be
patient
under
his
will
yet
not
quite
it
was
very
hard
to
be
patient
in
such
uncertainty
with
swimming
eyes
she
turned
over
her
bible
in
search
of
comfort
and
found
it
her
eye
lit
upon
words
she
knew
very
well
but
that
were
like
the
fresh
sight
of
a
friend
face
for
all
that
let
not
your
heart
be
troubled
ye
believe
in
god
believe
also
in
me
in
my
father
house
are
many
mansions
there
is
no
parting
there
thought
little
ellen
she
cried
a
long
time
but
she
was
comforted
nevertheless
the
heart
that
rests
on
the
blessed
one
who
said
those
words
can
never
be
quite
desolate
for
several
days
things
went
on
in
the
old
train
only
her
aunt
she
thought
was
sometimes
rather
queer
not
quite
as
usual
in
her
manner
towards
her
van
brunt
was
not
but
queer
he
scarce
spoke
or
looked
at
ellen
bolted
down
his
food
and
was
off
without
a
word
and
even
stayed
away
entirely
from
two
or
three
meals
she
saw
nobody
else
weather
and
other
circumstances
prevented
her
going
to
the
mountain
one
afternoon
she
was
giving
her
best
attention
to
a
french
lesson
when
she
heard
herself
called
miss
fortune
was
in
the
lower
kitchen
dipping
candles
ellen
ran
down
i
do
know
what
got
into
these
candles
said
miss
fortune
i
ca
make
hang
together
the
tallow
ai
good
i
guess
the
nearest
place
they
keep
bees
they
have
got
bees

hitchcock
said
ellen
so
they
have
in
egypt
for
anything
i
know
said
her
aunt
one
would
be
about
as
much
good
now
as
lowndes
that
ai
far
off
put
on
your
bonnet
ellen
and
run
over
there
and
ask
her
to
let
me
have
a
little
i
pay
her
in
something
she
likes
best
does
lowndes
keep
said
ellen
doubtfully
no
she
makes
the
herself
said
miss
fortune
in
the
tone
she
always
took
when
anybody
presumed
to
suppose
she
might
be
mistaken
in
anything
how
much
shall
i
ask
for
said
ellen
oh
i
do
know
a
pretty
good
piece
ellen
was
not
very
clear
what
quantity
this
might
mean
however
she
wisely
asked
no
more
questions
and
set
out
upon
her
walk
it
was
hot
and
disagreeable
just
the
time
of
day
when
the
sun
had
most
power
and
lowndes
house
was
about
half
way
on
the
road
to
alice
it
was
not
a
place
where
ellen
liked
to
go
though
the
people
always
made
much
of
her
she
did
not
fancy
them
and
regularly
kept
out
of
their
way
when
she
could
miss
mary
lawson
was
sitting
with
lowndes
and
her
daughter
when
ellen
came
in
and
briefly
gave
her
aunt
message
said
lowndes
well
i
do
know
how
much
does
she
want
i
do
know
exactly
she
said
a
pretty
good
piece
what
it
for
do
you
know
honey
i
believe
it
to
put
in
some
tallow
for
candles
said
ellen
the
tallow
was
too
soft
she
said
i
did
know
miss
fortune
tallow
was
ever
anything
but
the
hardest
said
sarah
lowndes
you
had
better
not
let
your
aunt
know
you
told
on
her
ellen
remarked
mary
lawson
she
wo
thank
you
had
she
a
good
lot
of
tallow
to
make
up
inquired
the
mother
preparing
to
cut
her
i
do
know
she
had
a
big
kettle
but
i
do
know
how
full
it
was
you
may
as
well
cut
a
good
piece
ma
while
you
are
about
it
said
the
daughter
and
ask
her
to
let
us
have
a
piece
of
her
sage
cheese
will
you
is
it
worth
while
to
weigh
it
whispered
lowndes
her
daughter
answered
in
the
same
tone
and
miss
mary
joining
them
a
conversation
of
some
length
went
on
over
the
which
ellen
could
not
hear
the
tones
of
the
speakers
became
lower
and
lower
till
at
length
her
own
name
and
an
incautious
sentence
were
spoken
more
distinctly
and
reached
her
should
you
think
miss
fortune
might
put
a
black
ribbon
at
least
on
her
bonnet
anybody
but
her
would
hush
they
whispered
again
under
breath
the
words
entered
ellen
heart
like
cold
iron
she
did
not
move
hand
or
foot
she
sat
motionless
with
pain
and
fear
yet
what
she
feared
she
dared
not
think
when
the
was
given
her
she
rose
up
from
her
chair
and
stood
gazing
into
lowndes
face
as
if
she
had
lost
her
senses
my
goodness
child
how
you
look
said
that
lady
what
ails
you
honey
said
ellen
what
was
that
you
said
about
about
what
dear
said
lowndes
with
a
startled
look
at
the
others
about
a
ribbon
said
ellen
struggling
to
get
the
words
out
of
white
lips
my
goodness
said
the
other
did
you
ever
hear
anything
like
that
i
did
say
nothing
about
a
ribbon
dear
do
you
suppose
her
aunt
told
her
said
miss
mary
in
an
undertone
told
me
what
cried
ellen
oh
what
what
i
wish
i
was
a
thousand
miles
off
said
lowndes
i
do
know
dear
i
do
know
what
it
is
miss
alice
knows
yes
ask
miss
alice
said
mary
lawson
she
knows
better
than
we
do
ellen
looked
doubtfully
from
one
to
the
other
then
as
go
ask
miss
alice
was
repeated
on
all
sides
she
caught
up
her
bonnet
and
flinging
the
from
her
hand
darted
out
of
the
house
those
she
had
left
looked
at
each
other
a
minute
in
silence
ai
that
too
bad
now
exclaimed
lowndes
crossing
the
room
to
shut
the
door
but
what
could
i
say
which
way
did
she
go
i
do
know
i
am
sure
i
had
no
head
to
look
or
anything
else
i
wonder
if
i
had
ought
to
ha
told
her
but
i
could
ha
done
it
just
look
at
her
said
sarah
lowndes
she
will
kill
herself
if
she
runs
up
the
mountain
at
that
rate
said
mary
lawson
they
all
made
a
rush
to
the
door
to
look
after
her
she
ai
in
sight
said
lowndes
if
she
gone
the
way
to
the
nose
she
got
as
far
as
them
big
poplars
already
or
she
be
somewhere
this
side
of
where
we
could
see
her
you
had
ought
to
ha
let
her
go
ma
in
all
this
sun
said
miss
lowndes
i
declare
said
lowndes
she
scared
me
so
i
had
three
idees
left
in
my
head
i
wish
i
knew
where
she
was
though
poor
little
soul
ellen
was
far
on
her
way
to
the
mountain
pressed
forward
by
a
fear
that
knew
no
stay
of
heat
or
fatigue
they
were
little
to
her
that
day
she
saw
nothing
on
her
way
all
within
and
without
was
swallowed
up
in
that
one
feeling
yet
she
dared
not
think
what
it
was
she
feared
she
put
that
by
alice
knew
alice
would
tell
her
on
that
goal
her
heart
fixed
to
that
she
pressed
on
but
oh
the
while
what
a
cloud
was
gathering
over
her
spirit
and
growing
darker
and
darker
her
hurry
of
mind
and
hurry
of
body
made
each
other
worse
it
must
be
so
and
when
she
at
last
ran
round
the
corner
of
the
house
and
burst
in
at
the
glass
door
she
was
in
a
frightful
state
alice
started
up
and
faced
her
as
she
came
in
but
with
a
look
that
stopped
ellen
short
she
stood
still
the
colour
in
her
cheeks
as
her
eyes
read
alice
faded
quite
away
words
and
the
power
to
speak
them
were
gone
together
alas
the
need
to
utter
them
was
gone
too
alice
burst
into
tears
and
held
out
her
arms
saying
only
my
poor
child
ellen
reached
her
arms
and
strength
and
spirit
seemed
to
fail
there
alice
thought
she
had
fainted
she
laid
her
on
the
sofa
called
margery
and
tried
the
usual
things
weeping
bitterly
herself
as
she
did
so
it
was
not
fainting
however
ellen
senses
soon
came
back
but
she
seemed
like
a
person
stunned
with
a
great
blow
and
alice
wished
grief
had
had
any
other
effect
upon
her
it
lasted
for
days
a
kind
of
stupor
hung
over
her
tears
did
not
come
the
violent
strain
of
every
nerve
and
feeling
seemed
to
have
left
her
benumbed
she
would
sleep
long
heavy
sleeps
the
greater
part
of
the
time
and
seemed
to
have
no
power
to
do
anything
else
her
adopted
sister
watched
her
constantly
and
for
those
days
lived
but
to
watch
her
she
had
heard
all
ellen
story
from
mary
lawson
and
van
brunt
who
had
both
been
to
the
parsonage
one
on
part
the
other
on
his
own
to
ask
about
her
and
she
dreaded
that
a
violent
fit
of
illness
might
be
brought
on
by
all
ellen
had
undergone
she
was
mistaken
however
ellen
was
not
ill
but
her
whole
mind
and
body
bowed
under
the
weight
of
the
blow
that
had
come
upon
her
as
the
first
stupor
wore
off
there
were
indeed
more
lively
signs
of
grief
she
would
weep
till
she
wept
her
eyes
out
and
that
often
but
it
was
very
quietly
no
passionate
sobbing
no
noisy
crying
sorrow
had
taken
too
strong
hold
to
be
struggled
with
and
ellen
meekly
bowed
her
head
to
it
alice
saw
this
with
the
greatest
alarm
she
had
refused
to
let
her
go
back
to
her
aunt
it
was
impossible
to
do
otherwise
yet
it
may
be
that
ellen
would
have
been
better
there
the
busy
industry
to
which
she
would
have
been
forced
at
home
might
have
roused
her
as
it
was
nothing
drew
her
and
nothing
could
be
found
to
draw
her
from
her
own
thoughts
her
interest
in
everything
seemed
to
be
gone
books
had
lost
their
charm
walks
and
drives
and
staying
at
home
were
all
one
except
indeed
that
she
rather
liked
best
the
latter
appetite
failed
her
cheeks
grew
colourless
and
alice
began
to
fear
that
if
a
stop
were
not
soon
put
to
this
gradual
sinking
it
would
at
last
end
with
her
life
but
all
her
efforts
were
without
fruit
and
the
winter
was
a
sorrowful
one
not
to
ellen
alone
as
it
wore
on
there
came
to
be
one
thing
in
which
ellen
again
took
pleasure
and
that
was
her
bible
she
used
to
get
alone
or
into
a
corner
with
it
and
turn
the
leaves
over
and
over
looking
out
its
gentle
promises
and
sweet
comforting
words
to
the
weak
and
the
sorrowing
she
loved
to
read
about
christ
all
he
said
and
did
all
his
kindness
to
his
people
and
tender
care
of
them
the
love
shown
them
here
and
the
joys
prepared
for
them
hereafter
she
began
to
cling
more
to
that
one
unchangeable
friend
from
whose
love
neither
life
nor
death
can
sever
those
that
believe
in
him
and
her
heart
tossed
and
shaken
as
it
had
been
began
to
take
rest
again
in
that
happy
with
stronger
affection
and
even
with
greater
joy
than
ever
before
yet
for
all
that
this
joy
often
kept
company
with
bitter
weeping
the
stirring
of
anything
like
pleasure
roused
sorrow
up
afresh
and
though
ellen
look
of
sadness
grew
less
dark
alice
could
not
see
that
her
face
was
at
all
less
white
and
thin
she
never
spoke
of
her
mother
after
once
hearing
when
and
where
she
had
died
she
never
hinted
at
her
loss
except
exclaiming
in
an
agony
i
shall
get
no
more
letters
and
alice
dared
not
touch
upon
what
the
child
seemed
to
avoid
so
carefully
though
ellen
sometimes
wept
on
her
bosom
and
often
sat
for
hours
still
and
silent
with
her
head
in
her
lap
the
time
drew
nigh
when
john
was
expected
home
for
the
holidays
in
the
meanwhile
they
had
had
many
visits
from
other
friends
van
brunt
had
come
several
times
enough
to
set
the
whole
neighbourhood
if
they
had
only
known
it
his
good
old
mother
oftener
still
vawse
as
often
as
possible
miss
fortune
once
and
that
because
as
she
said
to
herself
everybody
would
be
talking
about
what
was
none
of
their
business
if
she
did
as
neither
she
nor
ellen
knew
in
the
least
what
to
say
to
each
other
the
visit
was
rather
a
dull
one
spite
of
all
alice
could
do
jenny
hitchcock
and
the
huffs
and
the
dennisons
and
others
came
now
and
then
but
ellen
did
not
like
to
see
any
of
them
all
but
vawse
alice
longed
for
her
brother
he
came
at
last
just
before
new
year
day
it
was
the
middle
of
a
fine
afternoon
and
alice
and
her
father
had
gone
in
the
sleigh
to
ellen
had
chosen
to
stay
behind
but
margery
did
not
know
this
and
of
course
did
not
tell
john
after
paying
a
visit
to
her
in
the
kitchen
he
had
come
back
to
the
empty
and
was
thoughtfully
walking
up
and
down
the
floor
when
the
door
of
room
slowly
opened
and
ellen
appeared
it
was
never
her
way
when
she
could
help
it
to
show
violent
feeling
before
other
people
so
she
had
been
trying
to
steel
herself
to
meet
john
without
crying
and
now
came
in
with
her
little
grave
face
prepared
not
to
give
way
his
first
look
had
like
to
overset
it
all
ellie
said
he
i
thought
everybody
was
gone
my
dear
ellie
ellen
could
hardly
stand
the
tone
of
these
three
words
and
she
bore
with
the
greatest
difficulty
the
kiss
that
followed
them
it
took
but
a
word
or
two
more
and
a
glance
at
the
old
look
and
smile
to
break
down
entirely
all
her
guard
according
to
her
usual
fashion
she
was
rushing
away
but
john
held
her
fast
and
though
gently
drew
her
close
to
him
i
will
not
let
you
forget
that
i
am
your
brother
ellie
said
he
ellen
hid
her
face
on
his
shoulder
and
cried
as
if
she
had
never
cried
before
ellie
said
he
after
a
while
speaking
low
and
tenderly
the
bible
says
have
known
and
believed
the
love
that
god
hath
towards
us
have
you
remembered
and
believed
this
lately
ellen
did
not
answer
have
you
remembered
that
god
loves
every
sinner
that
has
believed
in
his
dear
son
and
loves
them
so
well
that
he
will
let
nothing
come
near
them
to
harm
them
and
loves
them
never
better
than
when
he
sends
bitter
trouble
on
them
it
is
wonderful
but
it
is
true
have
you
thought
of
this
ellie
she
shook
her
head
it
is
not
in
anger
he
does
it
it
is
not
that
he
has
forgotten
you
it
is
not
that
he
is
careless
of
your
trembling
little
heart
never
never
if
you
are
his
child
all
is
done
in
love
and
shall
work
good
for
you
and
if
we
often
can
not
see
how
it
is
because
we
are
weak
and
foolish
and
can
see
but
a
very
little
way
ellen
listened
with
her
face
hid
on
his
shoulder
do
you
love
christ
ellen
she
nodded
weeping
afresh
do
you
love
him
less
since
he
has
brought
you
into
this
great
sorrow
no
sobbed
ellen
he
drew
her
closer
to
his
breast
and
was
silent
a
little
while
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
you
say
that
then
all
will
be
well
and
you
the
best
reason
to
think
that
all
well
with
your
dear
mother
ellen
almost
shrieked
her
mother
name
had
not
been
spoken
before
her
in
a
great
while
and
she
could
hardly
bear
to
hear
it
now
her
whole
frame
quivered
with
hysterical
sobs
hush
ellie
said
john
in
a
tone
that
low
as
it
was
somehow
found
its
way
through
all
her
agitation
and
calmed
her
like
a
spell
have
you
not
good
reason
to
believe
that
all
is
well
with
her
oh
yes
oh
yes
she
loved
and
trusted
him
too
and
now
she
is
with
him
she
has
reached
that
bright
home
where
there
is
no
more
sin
nor
sorrow
nor
death
nor
parting
either
sobbed
ellen
whose
agitation
was
excessive
nor
parting
and
though
are
parted
from
them
it
is
but
for
a
little
let
us
watch
and
keep
our
garments
clean
and
soon
we
shall
be
all
together
and
have
done
with
tears
for
ever
has
done
with
them
now
did
you
hear
from
her
again
oh
no
not
a
word
that
is
a
hard
trial
but
in
it
all
believe
dear
ellie
the
love
that
god
hath
toward
us
remember
that
our
dear
saviour
is
near
us
and
feels
for
us
and
is
the
same
at
all
times
and
do
cry
so
ellie
he
kissed
her
once
or
twice
and
begged
her
to
calm
herself
for
it
seemed
as
if
ellen
very
heart
was
flowing
away
in
her
tears
yet
they
were
gentler
and
softer
far
than
at
the
beginning
the
conversation
had
been
a
great
relief
the
silence
between
her
and
alice
on
the
thing
always
in
her
mind
a
silence
neither
of
them
dared
to
break
had
grown
painful
the
spell
was
taken
off
and
though
at
first
ellen
tears
knew
no
measure
she
was
easier
even
then
as
john
soothed
her
and
went
on
with
his
kind
talk
gradually
leading
it
away
from
their
first
subject
to
other
things
she
grew
not
only
calm
but
more
peaceful
at
heart
than
months
had
seen
her
she
was
quite
herself
again
before
alice
came
home
you
have
done
her
good
already
exclaimed
alice
as
soon
as
ellen
was
out
of
the
room
i
knew
you
would
i
saw
it
in
her
face
as
soon
as
i
came
in
it
is
time
said
her
brother
she
is
a
dear
little
thing
the
next
day
in
the
middle
of
the
morning
ellen
to
her
great
surprise
saw
sharp
brought
before
the
door
with
the
on
and
john
carefully
looking
to
the
girth
and
shortening
the
stirrup
why
alice
she
exclaimed
what
is
john
going
to
do
i
do
know
ellie
i
am
sure
he
does
queer
things
sometimes
what
makes
you
ask
before
she
could
answer
he
opened
the
door
come
ellen
go
and
get
ready
bundle
up
well
for
it
is
rather
frosty
alice
has
she
a
pair
of
gloves
that
are
warm
enough
lend
her
yours
and
i
see
if
i
can
find
some
at
thirlwall
ellen
thought
she
would
rather
not
go
to
anybody
else
she
would
have
said
so
half
a
minute
she
stood
still
then
went
to
put
on
her
things
alice
you
will
be
ready
by
the
time
we
get
back
in
ellen
had
an
excellent
lesson
and
her
master
took
care
it
should
not
be
an
easy
one
she
came
back
looking
as
she
had
not
done
all
winter
alice
was
not
quite
ready
while
waiting
for
her
john
went
to
the
bookcase
and
took
down
the
first
volume
of
rollin
ancient
history
and
giving
it
to
ellen
said
he
would
talk
with
her
about
the
first
twenty
pages
the
consequence
was
the
hour
and
a
half
of
their
absence
instead
of
being
moped
away
was
spent
in
hard
study
a
pair
of
gloves
was
bought
at
thirlwall
jenny
hitchcock
pony
was
sent
for
and
after
that
every
day
when
the
weather
would
at
all
do
they
took
a
long
ride
by
degrees
reading
and
drawing
and
all
her
studies
were
added
to
the
history
till
ellen
time
was
well
filled
with
business
again
alice
had
endeavoured
to
bring
this
about
before
but
fruitlessly
what
she
asked
of
her
ellen
indeed
to
do
what
john
told
her
she
grew
a
different
creature
appetite
came
back
the
colour
sprang
again
to
her
cheek
hope
meek
and
sober
as
it
was
relighted
her
eye
in
her
eagerness
to
please
and
satisfy
her
teacher
her
whole
soul
was
given
to
the
performance
of
whatever
he
wished
her
to
do
the
effect
was
all
that
he
looked
for
the
second
evening
after
he
came
john
called
ellen
to
his
side
saying
he
had
something
he
wanted
to
read
to
her
it
was
before
candles
were
brought
but
the
room
was
full
of
light
from
the
blazing
wood
fire
ellen
glanced
at
his
book
as
she
came
to
the
sofa
it
was
a
largish
volume
in
a
black
leather
cover
a
good
deal
worn
it
did
not
look
at
all
interesting
what
is
it
she
asked
it
is
called
said
john
pilgrim
progress
from
this
world
to
a
better
ellen
thought
it
did
not
at
all
interesting
she
had
never
been
more
mistaken
in
her
life
and
that
she
found
almost
as
soon
as
he
began
her
attention
was
nailed
the
listless
careless
mood
in
which
she
sat
down
was
changed
for
one
of
rapt
delight
she
devoured
every
word
that
fell
from
the
reader
lips
indeed
they
were
given
their
fullest
effect
by
a
very
fine
voice
and
singularly
fine
reading
whenever
anything
might
not
be
quite
clear
to
ellen
john
stopped
to
make
it
so
and
with
his
help
and
without
it
many
a
lesson
went
home
next
day
she
looked
a
long
time
for
the
book
it
could
not
be
found
she
was
forced
to
wait
until
evening
then
to
her
great
joy
it
was
brought
out
again
and
john
asked
her
if
she
wished
to
hear
some
more
of
it
after
that
every
evening
while
he
was
at
home
they
spent
an
hour
with
the
pilgrim
alice
would
leave
her
work
and
come
to
the
sofa
too
and
with
her
head
on
her
brother
shoulder
her
hand
in
his
and
face
leaning
against
his
other
arm
that
was
the
common
way
they
placed
themselves
to
see
and
hear
no
words
can
tell
ellen
enjoyment
of
those
readings
they
made
her
sometimes
laugh
and
sometimes
cry
they
had
much
to
do
in
carrying
on
the
cure
which
john
wisdom
and
kindness
had
begun
they
came
to
the
place
where
christian
loses
his
burden
at
the
cross
and
as
he
stood
looking
and
weeping
three
shining
ones
came
to
him
the
first
said
to
him
thy
sins
be
forgiven
thee
the
second
stripped
him
of
his
rags
and
clothed
him
with
a
change
of
raiment
the
third
also
set
a
mark
on
his
forehead
john
explained
what
was
meant
by
the
rags
and
the
change
of
raiment
and
the
mark
in
his
forehead
said
ellen
that
is
the
mark
of
god
children
the
change
wrought
in
them
by
the
holy
spirit
the
change
that
makes
them
different
from
others
and
different
from
their
old
selves
do
all
christians
have
it
certainly
none
can
be
a
christian
without
it
but
how
can
any
one
tell
whether
one
has
it
or
no
said
ellen
very
gravely
carry
your
heart
and
life
to
the
bible
and
see
how
they
agree
the
bible
gives
a
great
many
signs
and
descriptions
by
which
christians
may
know
themselves
know
both
what
they
are
and
what
they
ought
to
be
if
you
find
your
own
feelings
and
manner
of
life
at
one
with
these
bible
words
you
may
hope
that
the
holy
spirit
has
changed
you
and
set
his
mark
upon
you
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
of
one
of
those
places
said
ellen
the
bible
is
full
of
them
them
that
believe
is
there
is
one
ye
love
me
my
that
saith
he
abideth
in
him
ought
himself
also
to
walk
even
as
he
how
i
thy
the
bible
is
full
of
them
ellie
but
you
have
need
to
ask
for
great
help
when
you
go
to
try
yourself
by
them
the
heart
is
deceitful
ellen
looked
sober
all
the
rest
of
the
evening
and
the
next
day
she
pondered
the
matter
a
good
deal
i
think
i
am
changed
she
said
to
herself
at
last
i
did
use
to
like
to
read
the
bible
and
now
i
do
very
much
i
never
liked
praying
in
old
times
and
now
oh
what
should
i
do
without
it
i
did
love
jesus
at
all
but
i
am
sure
i
do
now
i
do
keep
his
commandments
but
i
do
to
keep
them
i
be
changed
a
little
oh
i
wish
mamma
had
known
it
before
weeping
with
mixed
sorrow
and
thankful
joy
ellen
bent
her
head
upon
her
little
bible
to
pray
that
she
might
be
changed
and
then
as
she
often
did
raised
the
cover
to
look
at
the
text
in
the
beloved
handwriting
i
love
them
that
love
me
and
they
that
seek
me
early
shall
find
me
ellen
tears
were
blinding
her
that
has
come
true
she
thought
i
will
be
a
god
to
thee
and
to
thy
seed
after
thee
that
has
come
true
too
she
said
almost
in
surprise
and
mamma
believed
it
would
and
then
as
by
a
flash
came
back
to
her
mind
the
time
it
was
written
she
remembered
how
when
it
was
done
her
head
had
sunk
upon
the
open
page
she
seemed
to
see
again
the
thin
fingers
tightly
clasped
she
had
not
understood
it
then
she
did
now
she
was
praying
for
me
thought
ellen
she
was
praying
for
me
she
believed
that
would
come
true
the
book
was
dashed
down
and
ellen
fell
upon
her
knees
in
a
perfect
agony
of
weeping
even
this
when
she
was
calm
again
served
to
steady
her
mind
there
seemed
to
be
a
link
of
communion
between
her
mother
and
her
that
was
wanting
before
the
promise
written
and
believed
in
by
the
one
realised
and
rejoiced
in
by
the
other
was
a
dear
something
in
common
though
one
had
in
the
meanwhile
removed
to
heaven
and
the
other
was
still
a
lingerer
on
the
earth
ellen
bound
the
words
upon
her
heart
another
time
when
they
came
to
the
last
scene
of
christian
journey
ellen
tears
ran
very
fast
john
asked
if
he
should
pass
it
over
if
it
distressed
her
she
said
oh
no
it
did
not
distress
her
she
wanted
him
to
go
on
and
he
went
on
though
himself
much
distressed
and
alice
was
near
as
bad
as
ellen
but
the
next
evening
to
his
surprise
ellen
begged
that
before
he
went
on
to
the
second
part
he
would
read
that
piece
over
again
and
when
he
lent
her
the
book
with
only
the
charge
that
she
should
not
go
further
than
he
had
been
she
pored
over
that
scene
with
untiring
pleasure
till
she
almost
had
it
by
heart
in
short
never
was
a
child
more
comforted
and
contented
with
a
book
than
ellen
was
with
the
pilgrim
progress
that
was
a
blessed
visit
of
john
alice
said
he
had
come
like
a
sunbeam
into
the
house
she
dreaded
to
think
what
would
be
when
he
went
away
she
wrote
him
however
when
he
had
been
gone
a
few
weeks
that
his
will
seemed
to
carry
all
before
it
present
or
absent
ellen
went
on
steadily
mending
at
least
she
did
not
go
back
any
they
were
keeping
up
their
rides
also
their
studies
most
diligently
ellen
was
untiring
in
her
efforts
to
do
whatever
he
had
wished
her
and
was
springing
forward
alice
said
in
her
improvement
chapter
xxxv
i
keep
his
house
and
i
wash
wring
brew
bake
scour
dress
meat
and
make
the
beds
and
do
all
shakespeare
the
spring
had
come
and
alice
and
ellen
were
looking
forward
to
pleasanter
rides
and
walks
after
the
sun
should
have
got
a
little
warmth
and
the
snow
should
be
gone
when
one
morning
in
the
early
part
of
march
van
brunt
made
his
appearance
miss
fortune
was
not
well
and
had
sent
him
to
beg
that
ellen
would
come
back
to
her
he
was
sorry
he
said
he
knew
ellen
was
in
the
best
place
but
her
aunt
wanted
her
and
he
she
have
to
go
he
did
not
know
what
was
the
matter
with
miss
fortune
it
was
a
little
of
one
thing
and
a
little
of
another
he
she
overdid
and
it
was
a
wonder
for
he
did
know
she
do
it
thought
she
was
as
tough
as
a
piece
of
but
even
that
could
be
wore
out
ellen
looked
blank
however
she
hurriedly
set
herself
to
get
her
things
together
and
with
alice
help
in
she
was
ready
to
go
the
parting
was
hard
they
held
each
other
fast
a
good
while
and
kissed
each
other
many
times
without
speaking
dear
ellie
whispered
alice
at
last
i
come
and
see
you
soon
remember
what
john
said
when
he
went
away
ellen
did
not
trust
herself
to
speak
she
pulled
herself
away
from
alice
and
turned
to
van
brunt
saying
by
her
manner
that
she
was
ready
he
took
her
bundle
and
they
went
out
of
the
house
together
ellen
made
a
manful
effort
all
the
way
down
the
hill
to
stifle
the
tears
that
were
choking
her
she
knew
they
would
greatly
disturb
her
companion
and
she
did
succeed
though
with
great
difficulty
in
keeping
them
back
luckily
for
her
he
said
hardly
anything
during
the
whole
walk
she
could
not
have
borne
to
answer
a
question
it
was
no
fault
of
van
brunt
that
he
was
so
silent
he
was
beating
his
brains
the
whole
way
to
think
of
something
it
would
do
to
say
and
could
not
suit
himself
his
single
remark
was
that
it
was
like
to
be
a
fine
spring
for
the
maple
and
he
guessed
they
make
a
heap
of
sugar
when
they
reached
the
door
he
told
her
she
would
find
her
aunt
upstairs
and
himself
turned
off
to
the
barn
ellen
stopped
a
minute
upon
the
threshold
to
remember
the
last
time
she
had
crossed
it
and
the
time
how
changed
everything
now
and
the
thought
came
was
now
to
be
her
home
for
ever
she
had
need
again
to
remember
john
words
when
bidding
her
he
had
said
my
little
pilgrim
i
hope
you
will
keep
the
straight
road
and
win
the
praise
of
the
servant
who
was
faithful
over
a
few
things
i
will
try
thought
poor
ellen
and
then
she
passed
through
the
kitchen
and
went
up
to
her
own
room
here
without
stopping
to
think
she
took
off
her
things
gave
one
strange
look
at
the
old
familiar
place
and
her
trunk
in
the
corner
fell
on
her
knees
for
one
minute
and
then
went
to
her
aunt
room
come
in
cried
miss
fortune
when
ellen
had
knocked
well
ellen
there
you
are
i
am
thankful
it
is
you
i
was
afraid
it
might
be
mimy
lawson
or

lowndes
or

of
the
rest
of
the
set
i

sick
aunt

ellen

queer
this
morning
somehow
and
i
thought
i
try
lying
down
i
expect
i
caught
some
cold
there
was
no
doubt
of
this
but
this
was
not
all
besides
catching
cold
and
doing
her
best
to
bring
it
about
miss
fortune
had
overtasked
her
strength
and
by
dint
of
economy
housewifery
and
had
brought
on
herself
the
severe
punishment
of
lying
idle
and
helpless
for
a
much
longer
time
than
she
at
first
reckoned
on
what
can
i
do
for
you
aunt
fortune
said
ellen
oh
nothing
as
i
know
said
miss
fortune
only
let
me
alone
and
ask
me
anything
and
keep
people
out
of
the
house
mercy
my
head
feels
as
if
it
would
go
crazy
ellen
look
here
said
she
raising
herself
on
her
elbow
i

anybody

into
this
house

lie
here
till
doomsday

else
poking
all
round
into
every
hole
and
corner
and
turning
every
cheese
upside
down
to
see
what
under
it
there
one
of
too
good
for
it
and
they
have
a
chance
they
be
streaking
here
a
dozen
of
to
help
take
care
of
the
house
but
i
do
care
what
becomes
of
the
house
i
wo
have
anybody
in
it
promise
me
you
wo
let
van
brunt
bring
any
one
here
to
help
i
know
i
can
trust
to
you
to
do
what
i
tell
you
promise
me
ellen
promised
a
good
deal
gratified
at
her
aunt
last
words
and
once
more
asked
if
she
could
do
anything
for
her
oh
i
do
know
said
miss
fortune
flinging
herself
back
on
her
pillow
i
do
care
what
you
do
if
you
only
keep
the
house
clear
there
the
clothes
in
the
basket
under
the
table
downstairs
you
might
begin
to
iron
they
only
rough
dry
but
do
come
asking
me
about
anything
i
ca
bear
it
ellen
do
let
a
soul
go
into
the
buttery
except
yourself
and
ellen
i
do
care
if
you
make
me
a
little
catnip
tea
the
catnip
up
in
the
storeroom
the
furthest
door
in
the
back
attic
here
the
keys
do
go
fussing
with
anything
else
there
ellen
thought
the
prospect
before
her
rather
doleful
when
she
reached
the
kitchen
it
was
in
order
to
be
sure
and
clean
but
it
looked
as
if
the
mistress
was
away
the
fire
had
gone
out
the
room
was
cold
even
so
little
a
matter
as
catnip
tea
seemed
a
thing
far
off
and
hard
to
come
by
while
she
stood
looking
at
the
great
logs
in
the
fireplace
which
she
could
hardly
move
and
thinking
it
was
rather
a
dismal
state
of
things
in
came
van
brunt
with
his
face
and
wanted
to
know
if
he
could
do
anything
for
her
the
very
room
seemed
more
comfortable
as
soon
as
his
big
figure
was
in
it
he
set
about
kindling
the
fire
forthwith
while
ellen
went
up
to
the
storeroom
a
storeroom
among
other
things
there
hung
at
least
a
dozen
bunches
of
dried
herbs
from
one
of
the
rafters
ellen
thought
she
knew
catnip
but
after
smelling
of
two
or
three
she
became
utterly
puzzled
and
was
fain
to
carry
a
leaf
of
several
kinds
down
to
van
brunt
to
find
out
which
was
which
when
she
came
down
again
she
found
he
had
hung
on
the
kettle
for
her
and
swept
up
the
hearth
so
ellen
wisely
thinking
it
was
best
to
keep
busy
put
the
ironing
blanket
on
the
table
and
folded
the
clothes
and
set
the
irons
to
the
fire
by
this
time
the
kettle
boiled
how
to
make
catnip
tea
ellen
did
not
exactly
know
but
supposed
it
must
follow
the
same
rules
as
black
tea
in
the
making
of
which
she
felt
herself
very
much
at
home
so
she
put
a
pinch
or
two
of
catnip
leaves
into
the
pot
poured
a
little
water
on
them
and
left
it
to
draw
meanwhile
came
in
kind
van
brunt
with
an
armful
or
two
of
small
short
sticks
for
the
fire
which
ellen
could
manage
i
wish
i
could
stay
here
and
take
care
of
you
all
the
while
said
he
but
i
be
round
if
you
want
anything
you
must
come
to
the
door
and
holler
ellen
began
to
thank
him
just
do
say
anything
about
that
said
he
moving
his
hands
as
if
he
were
shaking
her
thanks
out
of
them
i
back
all
the
wood
you
could
burn
every
day
for
the
pleasure
of
having
you
hum
again
if
i
know
you
was
better
where
you
was
but
i
ca
help
that
now
who
am
i
going
to
get
to
stay
with
you
who
would
you
like
to
have
nobody
if
you
please
van
brunt
said
ellen
aunt
fortune
wish
it
and
i
had
rather
not
indeed
he
stood
up
and
looked
at
her
in
amazement
why
you
do
mean
to
say
said
he
that
you
are
thinking
or
she
is
thinking
you
can
get
along
here
alone
without
help
i
get
along
somehow
said
ellen
never
mind
please
let
me
van
brunt
it
would
worry
aunt
fortune
very
much
to
have
anybody
say
anything
about
it
worry
her
said
he
and
he
muttered
something
ellen
did
not
quite
understand
about
bringing
the
old
woman
to
reason
however
he
went
off
for
the
present
and
ellen
filled
up
her
teapot
and
carried
it
upstairs
her
old
grandmother
was
awake
before
when
ellen
was
in
the
room
she
had
been
napping
now
she
showed
the
greatest
delight
at
seeing
her
fondled
her
kissed
her
cried
over
her
and
finally
insisted
on
getting
up
directly
and
going
downstairs
ellen
received
and
returned
her
caresses
with
great
tenderness
and
then
began
to
help
her
to
rise
and
dress
yes
do
said
miss
fortune
i
shall
have
a
little
better
chance
of
sleeping
my
stars
ellen
what
do
you
call
this
is
it
catnip
said
ellen
alarmed
catnip
it
tastes
of
nothing
but
the
it
as
weak
as
take
it
down
and
make
some
more
how
much
did
you
put
in
you
want
a
good
double
handful
stalks
and
all
make
it
strong
i
drink
such
stuff
as
that
i
think
if
i
could
get
into
a
sweat
i
should
be
better
ellen
went
down
established
her
grandmother
in
her
old
corner
and
made
some
more
tea
then
her
irons
being
hot
she
began
to
iron
doing
double
duty
at
the
same
time
for
montgomery
had
one
of
her
talking
fits
on
and
it
was
necessary
to
hear
and
answer
a
great
many
things
presently
the
first
visitor
appeared
in
the
shape
of
nancy

impatiently
flung
down
the
cloth
she
was
sprinkling
and
ran
upstairs
in
a
few
minutes
she
came
down
with
a
triumphant
face
and
bade
ellen
go
up
to
her
aunt
ellen
said
miss
fortune
if
i
let
nancy
stay
will
you
take
care
of

buttery

me
a
little
in
the
winter
she
is
smart
and
knows
the
ways
if
i
was
sure
she
would
behave
herself
but
i
am
afraid
she
will
go
rampaging
about
the
house
like
a
wild
cat
i
think
i
could
prevent
that
said
ellen
who
to
say
truth
was
willing
to
have
anybody
come
to
share
what
she
felt
would
be
a
very
great
burden
she
knows
i
could
tell
van
brunt
if
she
did
do
right
and
she
would
be
afraid
of
that
well
said
miss
fortune
disconsolately
let
her
stay
then
oh
dear
to
lie
here
but
tell
her
if
she
do
do
just
what
you
tell
her
have
van
brunt
turn
her
out
by
the
ears
and
do
let
her
come
near
me
for
she
drives
me
mad
and
ellen
put
the
keys
in
your
pocket
have
you
got
a
pocket
in
that
dress
yes
put
in
there
and
do
take
out
now
go
nancy
agreed
to
the
conditions
with
great
glee
and
the
little
housekeeper
felt
her
mind
a
good
deal
easier
for
though
nancy
herself
was
somewhat
of
a
charge
she
was
strong
and
willing
and
ready
and
if
she
liked
anybody
liked
ellen
van
brunt
privately
asked
ellen
if
she
chose
to
have
nancy
stay
and
told
her
if
she
gave
her
any
trouble
to
let
him
know
and
he
would
make
short
work
with
her
the
young
lady
herself
also
had
a
hint
on
the
subject
i
tell
you
what
said
nancy
when
this
business
was
settled
let
the
men
go
off
to
miss
van
brunt
to
meals
we
have
enough
to
do
without
that
how
miss
fortune
has
fixed
herself
she
would
have
sam
and
johnny
in
to
board
they
never
used
to
you
know
afore
this
winter
the
men
may
go
said
ellen
but
i
had
a
great
deal
rather
van
brunt
would
stay
than
not
if
we
can
only
manage
to
cook
things
for
him
we
should
have
to
do
it
at
any
rate
for
ourselves
and
for
grandma
well
ai
as
fond
as
him
as
all
that
said
nancy
but
have
to
be
as
you
like
i
suppose
we
feed
him
somehow
van
brunt
came
in
to
ask
if
they
had
anything
in
the
house
for
supper
ellen
told
him
plenty
and
would
have
him
come
in
just
as
usual
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
make
tea
cold
meat
and
bread
and
butter
and
cheese
were
all
in
the
buttery
so
that
evening
went
off
very
quietly
when
she
came
down
the
next
morning
the
fire
was
burning
nicely
and
the
kettle
on
and
singing
not
nancy
work
van
brunt
had
slept
in
the
kitchen
whether
on
the
table
the
floor
or
the
chairs
was
best
known
to
himself
and
before
going
to
his
work
had
left
everything
he
could
think
of
ready
done
to
her
hand
wood
for
the
fire
pails
of
water
brought
from
the
spout
and
some
matters
in
the
lower
kitchen
got
out
of
the
way
ellen
stood
warming
herself
at
the
blaze
when
it
suddenly
darted
into
her
head
that
it
was
milking
time
in
another
minute
she
had
thrown
open
the
door
and
was
running
across
the
to
the
barn
there
in
the
old
place
were
all
her
old
friends
both
and
and
with
great
delight
she
found
dolly
had
a
fine
calf
and
streaky
another
superb
one
brindled
just
like
herself
ellen
longed
to
get
near
enough
to
touch
their
little
innocent
heads
but
it
was
impossible
and
recollecting
the
business
on
her
hands
she
too
danced
away
whew
said
nancy
when
ellen
told
her
of
the
new
inmates
of
the
there
be
work
to
do
get
your
ready
ellen
in
a
couple
of
weeks
we
be
making
butter
aunt
fortune
will
be
well
by
that
time
i
hope
said
ellen
she
wo
then
so
you
may
just
make
up
your
mind
to
it
gibson
was
to
see
her
yesterday
forenoon
and
he
stopped
at
miss
lowndes
on
his
way
back
and
he
said
it
was
a
chance
if
she
got
up
again
in
a
month
an
more
so
that
what
it
is
you
see
a
month
and
more
it
was
all
that
miss
fortune
was
not
dangerously
ill
but
one
part
of
the
time
in
a
low
nervous
fever
part
of
the
time
encumbered
with
other
ailments
she
lay
from
week
to
week
bearing
her
confinement
as
ill
as
possible
and
making
it
as
disagreeable
and
burdensome
as
possible
for
ellen
to
attend
upon
her
those
were
weeks
of
trial
ellen
patience
and
principle
and
temper
were
all
put
to
the
proof
she
had
no
love
in
the
first
place
for
household
work
and
now
her
whole
time
was
filled
up
with
it
studies
could
not
be
thought
of
reading
was
only
to
be
had
by
mere
snatches
walks
and
rides
were
at
an
end
often
when
already
very
tired
she
had
to
run
up
and
down
stairs
for
her
aunt
or
stand
and
bathe
her
face
and
hands
with
vinegar
or
read
the
paper
to
her
when
miss
fortune
declared
she
was
so
nervous
she
should
fly
out
of
her
skin
if
she
did
hear
something
besides
the
wind
and
very
often
when
she
was
not
wanted
upstairs
her
old
grandmother
would
beg
her
to
come
and
read
to
perhaps
at
the
very
moment
when
ellen
was
busiest
ellen
did
her
best
miss
fortune
never
could
be
put
off
her
old
mother
sometimes
could
with
a
kiss
and
a
promise
but
not
always
and
then
rather
than
she
should
fret
ellen
would
leave
everything
and
give
to
soothing
and
satisfying
her
she
loved
to
do
this
at
other
times
now
it
was
sometimes
burdensome
nancy
could
not
help
her
at
all
in
these
matters
for
neither
miss
fortune
nor
the
old
lady
would
let
her
come
near
them
besides
all
this
there
was
a
measure
of
care
constantly
upon
mind
she
felt
charged
with
the
welfare
of
all
about
the
house
and
under
the
effort
to
meet
the
charge
joined
to
the
unceasing
bodily
exertion
she
grew
thin
and
pale
she
was
tired
with
nancy
talk
she
longed
to
be
reading
and
studying
again
she
longed
oh
how
she
longed
for
alice
and
john
company
again
and
it
was
no
wonder
if
she
sometimes
cast
very
sad
longing
looks
further
back
still
now
and
then
an
old
fit
of
weeping
would
come
but
ellen
remembered
john
words
and
often
in
the
midst
of
her
work
stopping
short
with
a
sort
of
pang
of
sorrow
and
weariness
and
the
difficulty
of
doing
right
she
would
press
her
hands
together
and
say
to
herself
i
will
try
to
be
a
good
pilgrim
her
morning
hour
of
prayer
was
very
precious
now
and
her
bible
grew
more
and
more
dear
little
ellen
found
its
words
a
mighty
refreshment
and
often
when
reading
it
she
loved
to
recall
what
alice
had
said
at
this
and
the
other
place
and
john
and
marshman
and
before
them
her
mother
the
passages
about
heaven
which
she
well
remembered
reading
to
her
one
particular
morning
became
great
favourites
they
were
joined
with
her
mother
in
ellen
thoughts
and
she
used
to
go
over
and
over
them
till
she
nearly
knew
them
by
heart
what
you
keep
reading
that
for
the
whole
time
said
nancy
one
day
because
i
like
to
said
ellen
well
if
you
do
you
the
first
one
ever
i
saw
that
did
o
nancy
said
ellen
your
grandma
well
she
does
i
believe
said
nancy
for
she
always
at
it
but
all
the
rest
of
the
folks
that
ever
i
saw
are
happy
to
get
it
out
of
their
hands
know
they
think
they
must
read
a
little
and
so
they
do
and
they
are
too
glad
if
something
happens
to
break
off
you
need
tell
i
seen
i
wish
loved
it
nancy
said
ellen
well
what
do
you
love
it
for
come
let
hear
maybe
you
convert
me
i
love
it
for
a
great
many
reasons
said
ellen
who
had
some
difficulty
in
speaking
of
what
she
felt
nancy
could
not
understand
well
i
ai
any
wiser
yet
i
like
to
read
it
because
i
want
to
go
to
heaven
and
it
tells
me
how
but
what
the
use
said
nancy
you
ai
going
to
die
yet
you
are
too
young
you
have
time
enough
o
nancy
little
john
dolan
and
eleanor
parsons
and
mary
huff
all
younger
than
you
and
i
how
can
you
say
so
well
said
nancy
at
any
rate
that
ai
reading
it
because
you
love
it
it
because
you
must
like
other
folks
that
only
one
of
my
reasons
said
ellen
hesitating
and
speaking
gravely
i
like
to
read
about
the
saviour
and
what
he
has
done
for
me
and
what
a
friend
he
will
be
to
me
and
how
he
forgives
me
i
had
rather
have
the
bible
nancy
than
all
the
other
books
in
the
world
that
ai
saying
much
said
nancy
but
how
come
you
to
be
so
sure
you
are
forgiven
because
the
bible
says
that
believeth
on
him
shall
not
be
ashamed
and
i
believe
in
him
and
that
he
will
not
cast
out
any
one
that
comes
to
him
and
i
have
come
to
him
and
that
he
loves
those
that
love
him
and
i
love
him
if
it
did
not
speak
so
very
plainly
i
should
be
afraid
but
it
makes
me
happy
to
read
such
verses
as
these
i
wish
you
knew
nancy
how
happy
it
makes
me
this
profession
of
faith
was
not
spoken
without
starting
tears
nancy
made
no
reply
as
miss
fortune
had
foretold
plenty
of
people
came
to
the
house
with
proffers
of
service
nancy
being
there
made
it
easy
for
ellen
to
get
rid
of
them
all
many
were
the
marvels
that
miss
fortune
should
trust
her
house
to
two
girls
like
that
and
many
the
guesses
that
she
would
rue
it
when
she
got
up
again
people
were
wrong
things
went
on
very
steadily
and
in
an
orderly
manner
and
nancy
kept
the
peace
as
she
would
have
done
in
few
houses
bold
and
insolent
as
she
sometimes
was
to
others
she
regarded
ellen
with
a
mixed
notion
of
respect
and
protection
which
led
her
at
once
to
shun
doing
anything
that
would
grieve
her
and
to
thrust
her
aside
from
every
heavy
or
difficult
job
taking
the
brunt
herself
nancy
might
well
do
this
for
she
was
at
least
twice
as
strong
as
ellen
but
she
would
not
have
done
it
for
everybody
there
were
visits
of
kindness
as
well
as
visits
of
officiousness
alice
and
van
brunt
and
margery
one
or
the
other
every
day
margery
would
come
in
and
mix
up
a
batch
of
bread
alice
would
bring
a
bowl
of
butter
or
a
basket
of
cake
and
van
brunt
sent
whole
dinners
van
brunt
was
there
always
at
night
and
about
the
place
as
much
as
possible
during
the
day
when
obliged
to
be
absent
he
stationed
sam
larkens
to
guard
the
house
also
to
bring
wood
and
water
and
do
whatever
he
was
bid
all
the
help
however
that
was
given
from
abroad
could
not
make
ellen
life
an
easy
one
van
brunt
wishes
that
miss
fortune
would
get
up
again
began
to
come
very
often
the
history
of
one
day
may
serve
for
the
history
of
all
those
weeks
it
was
in
the
beginning
of
april
ellen
came
downstairs
early
but
come
when
she
would
she
found
the
fire
made
and
the
kettle
on
ellen
felt
a
little
as
if
she
had
not
quite
slept
off
the
remembrance
of
fatigue
however
that
was
no
matter
she
set
to
work
she
swept
up
the
kitchen
got
her
milk
strainer
and
pans
ready
upon
the
buttery
shelf
and
began
to
set
the
table
by
the
time
this
was
half
done
in
came
sam
larkens
with
two
great
pails
of
milk
and
johnny
low
followed
with
another
they
were
much
too
heavy
for
ellen
to
lift
but
true
to
her
charge
she
let
no
one
come
into
the
buttery
but
herself
she
brought
the
pans
to
the
door
where
sam
filled
them
for
her
and
as
each
was
done
she
set
it
in
its
place
on
the
shelf
this
took
some
time
for
there
were
eight
of
them
she
had
scarce
wiped
up
the
spilt
milk
and
finished
setting
the
table
when
van
brunt
came
in
good
morning
said
he
how
d
do
very
well
van
brunt
i
wish
you
look
a
little
redder
in
the
face
do
you
be
too
busy
where
nancy
oh
she
busy
out
with
the
clothes
same
as
ever
upstairs
what
are
you
going
to
do
for
breakfast
ellen
i
do
know
van
brunt
there
is
anything
cooked
in
the
house
we
have
eaten
everything
up
cleaned
out
eh
bread
and
all
oh
no
not
bread
there
plenty
of
that
but
there
nothing
else
well
never
mind
you
bring
me
a
ham
and
a
dozen
of
eggs
and
i
make
you
a
breakfast
ellen
laughed
for
this
was
not
the
first
time
van
brunt
had
acted
as
cook
for
the
family
while
she
got
what
he
had
asked
for
and
bared
a
place
on
the
table
for
his
operations
he
went
to
the
spout
and
washed
his
hands
now
a
sharp
knife
ellen
and
the
and
a
dish
and
all
i
want
of
you
ellen
brought
them
and
while
he
was
busy
with
the
ham
she
made
the
coffee
and
set
it
by
the
side
of
the
fire
to
boil
got
the
cream
and
butter
and
set
the
bread
on
the
table
and
then
set
herself
down
to
rest
and
amuse
herself
with
van
brunt
cookery
he
was
no
mean
hand
his
slices
of
ham
were
very
and
frying
away
in
the
most
unexceptional
manner
ellen
watched
him
and
laughed
at
him
till
the
ham
was
taken
out
and
all
the
eggs
broke
in
then
after
seeing
that
the
coffee
was
right
she
went
upstairs
to
dress
her
grandmother
always
the
last
thing
before
breakfast
who
frying
ham
and
eggs
downstairs
inquired
miss
fortune
van
brunt
said
ellen
this
answer
was
unexpected
miss
fortune
tossed
her
head
over
in
a
dissatisfied
kind
of
way
and
told
ellen
to
tell
him
to
be
careful
of
what
thought
ellen
and
wisely
concluded
with
herself
not
to
deliver
the
message
very
certain
she
should
laugh
if
she
did
and
she
had
running
in
her
head
an
indistinct
notion
of
the
command
honour
thy
father
and
thy
mother
breakfast
was
ready
but
no
one
there
when
she
got
downstairs
she
placed
her
grandmother
at
table
and
called
nancy
who
all
this
time
had
been
getting
the
clothes
out
of
the
rinsing
water
and
hanging
them
out
on
the
line
to
dry
the
said
clothes
having
been
washed
the
day
before
by
miss
sarah
lowndes
who
came
there
for
the
purpose
ellen
poured
out
the
coffee
and
then
in
came
van
brunt
with
a
head
of
early
lettuce
which
he
had
pulled
in
the
garden
and
washed
at
the
spout
ellen
had
to
jump
up
again
to
get
the
salt
and
pepper
and
vinegar
but
she
always
jumped
willingly
for
van
brunt
the
meals
were
pleasanter
during
those
weeks
than
in
all
the
time
ellen
had
been
in
thirlwall
before
or
she
thought
so
that
sharp
eye
at
the
head
of
the
table
was
pleasantly
missed
they
with
one
accord
sat
longer
at
meals
more
talking
and
laughing
went
on
nobody
felt
afraid
of
being
snapped
up
van
brunt
praised
ellen
coffee
he
had
taught
her
how
to
make
it
and
she
praised
his
ham
and
eggs
old
montgomery
praised
everything
and
seemed
to
be
in
particular
comfort
talking
as
much
as
she
had
a
mind
and
was
respectfully
attended
to
nancy
was
in
high
feather
and
the
clatter
of
knives
and
forks
and
teacups
went
on
very
pleasantly
but
at
last
chairs
were
pushed
from
the
table
and
work
began
again
nancy
went
back
to
her
tubs
ellen
supplied
her
grandmother
with
her
knitting
and
filled
her
cleared
the
table
and
put
up
the
dishes
ready
for
washing
then
she
went
into
the
buttery
to
skim
the
cream
this
was
a
part
of
the
work
she
liked
it
was
heavy
lifting
the
pans
of
milk
to
the
skimming
shelf
before
the
window
but
as
ellen
drew
her
spoon
round
the
edge
of
the
cream
she
liked
to
see
it
wrinkle
up
in
thick
yellow
leathery
folds
showing
how
deep
and
rich
it
was
it
looked
half
butter
already
she
knew
how
to
take
it
off
now
very
nicely
the
cream
was
set
by
in
a
vessel
for
future
churning
and
the
milk
as
each
pan
was
skimmed
was
poured
down
the
wooden
trough
at
the
left
of
the
window
through
which
it
went
into
a
great
hogshead
at
the
lower
kitchen
door
this
done
ellen
went
upstairs
to
her
aunt
gibson
always
came
early
and
she
and
her
room
must
be
put
in
order
first
it
was
a
long
and
wearisome
job
ellen
brought
the
basin
for
her
to
wash
her
face
and
hands
then
combed
her
hair
and
put
on
her
clean
cap
that
was
always
the
first
thing
the
next
was
to
make
the
bed
and
for
this
miss
fortune
weak
or
strong
wrapped
herself
up
and
tumbled
out
upon
the
floor
when
she
was
comfortably
placed
again
ellen
had
to
go
through
a
laborious
dusting
of
the
room
and
all
the
things
in
it
even
taking
a
and
brush
to
the
floor
if
any
speck
of
dust
or
crumbs
could
be
seen
there
every
rung
of
every
chair
must
be
gone
over
though
ever
so
clean
every
article
put
up
or
put
out
of
the
way
miss
fortune
made
the
most
of
the
little
province
of
housekeeping
that
was
left
her
and
a
fluttering
tape
escaping
through
the
crank
of
the
door
would
have
put
her
whole
spirit
when
all
was
to
her
mind
and
not
before
she
would
have
her
breakfast
only
gruel
and
biscuit
or
toast
and
tea
or
some
such
trifle
but
ellen
must
prepare
it
and
bring
it
upstairs
and
wait
till
it
was
eaten
and
very
particularly
it
must
be
prepared
and
very
faultlessly
it
must
be
served
or
with
an
impatient
expression
of
disgust
miss
fortune
would
send
it
down
again
on
the
whole
ellen
always
thought
herself
happy
when
this
part
of
her
day
was
well
over
when
she
got
down
this
morning
she
found
the
kitchen
in
nice
order
and
nancy
standing
by
the
fire
in
a
little
sort
of
pause
having
just
done
her
breakfast
dishes
well
said
nancy
what
are
you
going
to
do

nancy
went
round
the
cellar
gathering
in
her
apron
the
various
roots
she
wanted
ellen
uncovered
the
pork
barrel
and
after
looking
a
minute
at
the
dark
pickle
she
never
loved
to
plunge
into
bravely
bared
her
arm
and
fished
up
a
piece
of
pork
now
nancy

churn

she
went
off
to
the
garden
for
parsnips
and
ellen
quietly
put
in
the
dasher
and
the
cover
and
began
to
churn
it
was
tiresome
work
the
churn
was
pretty
full
as
nancy
had
said
the
cream
was
rich
and
cold
and
at
the
end
of
grew
very
stiff
it
spattered
and
sputtered
up
on
ellen
face
and
hands
and
apron
and
over
the
floor
legs
and
arms
were
both
weary
but
still
that
pitiless
dasher
must
go
up
and
down
hard
as
it
might
be
to
force
it
either
way
she
must
not
stop
in
this
state
of
matters
she
heard
a
pair
of
thick
shoes
come
clumping
down
the
stairs
and
beheld
van
brunt

with
a
sigh

van
brunt
stepped
to
the
door
and
shouted
for
sam
larkens
he
was
ordered
to
take
the
churn
and
bring
the
butter
and
ellen
very
glad
of
rest
went
out
to
amuse
herself
with
feeding
the
chickens
and
then
upstairs
to
see
what
nancy
was
doing

nancy

ellen
smiling
margery
showed

nicely
he
brought
her
a
pail
of
water
from
the
spout
and
stood
by
with
a
pleased
kind
of
look
while
she
carefully
lifted
the
cover
and
rinsed
down
the
little
bits
of
butter
which
stuck
to
it
and
the
dasher
took
out
the
butter

her
ladle
into
a
large
wooden
bowl

as
soon
as
i
set
this
in
the
cellar
and
cover
it
up
nancy
dish
the
pork
potatoes
carrots
beans
and
cabbage
all
boiled
in
the
same
pot
together
was
found
very
much
to
everybody
taste
except
ellen
she
made
her
dinner
off
potatoes
and
bread
the
former
of
which
she
declared
laughing
were
very
porky
and
cabbagy
her
meal
would
have
been
an
extremely
light
one
had
it
not
been
for
the
after
dinner
new
labours
began
nancy
had
forgotten
to
hang
on
a
pot
of
water
for
the
dishes
so
after
putting
away
the
eatables
in
the
buttery
while
the
water
was
heating
ellen
warmed
some
gruel
and
carried
it
with
a
plate
of
biscuit
upstairs
to
her
aunt
but
miss
fortune
said
she
was
tired
of
gruel
and
could
eat
it
she
must
have
some
milk
porridge
and
she
gave
ellen
very
particular
directions
how
to
make
it
ellen
sighed
only
once
as
she
went
down
with
her
despised
dish
of
gruel
and
set
about
doing
her
best
to
fulfil
her
aunt
wishes
the
first
dish
of
milk
she
burnt
another
sigh
and
another
trial
better
care
this
time
had
better
success
and
ellen
had
the
satisfaction
to
see
her
aunt
perfectly
suited
with
her
dinner
when
she
came
down
with
the
empty
bowl
nancy
had
a
pile
of
dishes
ready
washed
and
ellen
took
the
towel
to
dry
them
montgomery
who
had
been
in
an
uncommonly
quiet
fit
all
day
now
laid
down
her
knitting
and
asked
if
ellen
would
not
come
and
read
to
her
presently
grandma
as
soon
as
i
have
done
here
i
know
somebody
that

nancy

you
what
ellen
you
had
better

to
liking

a
bit
there
somebody
coming
to
the
door
again
do
run
and
open
it
will
you
my
hands
are
wet
i
wonder
why
folks
ca

in
without
giving
so
much
trouble
it
was
thomas
again
with
a
package
for
ellen
which
had
just
come
he
said
and
miss
alice
thought
she
would
like
to
have
it
directly
ellen
thanked
her
and
thanked
him
with
a
face
from
which
all
signs
of
weariness
had
fled
away
the
parcel
was
sealed
up
and
directed
in
a
hand
she
was
pretty
sure
she
knew
her
fingers
burned
to
break
the
seal
but
she
would
not
open
it
there
neither
leave
her
work
unfinished
she
went
on
wiping
the
dishes
with
trembling
hands
and
a
beating
heart
what
that
said
nancy
what
did
thomas
grimes
want
what
have
you
got
there
i
do
know
said
ellen
smiling
something
good
i
guess
something
good
is
it
something
to
eat
no
said
ellen
i
did
mean
anything
to
eat
when
i
said
something
good
i
do
think
those
are
the
best
things
to
ellen
delight
she
saw
that
her
grandmother
had
forgotten
about
the
reading
and
was
quietly
taking
short
naps
with
her
head
against
the
chimney
so
she
put
away
the
last
dish
and
then
seized
her
package
and
flew
upstairs
she
was
sure
it
had
come
from
doncaster
she
was
right
it
was
a
beautiful
copy
of
the
pilgrim
progress
on
the
first
leaf
written
to
my
little
sister
ellen
montgomery
from
and
within
the
cover
lay
a
letter
this
letter
ellen
read
in
the
course
of
the
next
six
days
at
least
twice
as
many
times
and
never
without
crying
over
it
alice
has
told
me
said
john
about
your
new
troubles
there
is
said
to
be
a
time
clouds
return
after
the
rain
i
am
sorry
my
little
sister
this
time
should
come
to
you
so
early
i
often
think
of
you
and
wish
i
could
be
near
you
still
dear
ellie
the
good
husbandman
knows
what
his
plants
want
do
you
believe
that
and
can
you
trust
him
they
should
have
nothing
but
sunshine
if
that
was
good
for
them
he
knows
it
is
not
so
there
come
clouds
and
rains
and
winds
fulfilling
his
will
and
what
is
it
all
for
is
my
father
glorified
ye
bear
much
do
not
disappoint
his
purpose
ellie
we
shall
have
sunshine
enough
but
i
know
it
is
hard
for
so
young
a
one
as
my
little
sister
to
look
much
forward
so
do
not
look
forward
ellie
look
up
look
off
unto
jesus
from
all
your
duties
troubles
and
wants
he
will
help
you
in
them
all
the
more
you
look
up
to
him
the
more
he
will
look
down
to
you
and
he
especially
said
to
come
unto
me
you
see
you
are
particularly
invited
ellen
was
a
long
time
upstairs
and
when
she
came
down
it
was
with
red
eyes
montgomery
was
now
awake
and
asked
for
the
reading
again
and
for
of
an
hour
ellen
and
she
were
quietly
busy
with
the
bible
nancy
meanwhile
was
downstairs
washing
the
dairy
things
when
her
grandmother
released
her
ellen
had
to
go
up
to
wait
upon
her
aunt
after
which
she
went
into
the
buttery
and
skimmed
the
cream
and
got
the
pans
ready
for
the
evening
milk
by
this
time
it
was
five
and
nancy
came
in
with
the
basket
of
dry
clothes
at
which
ellen
looked
with
the
sorrowful
consciousness
that
they
must
be
sprinkled
and
folded
and
ironed
it
happened
however
that
jane
huff
came
in
just
then
with
a
quantity
of
hot
for
tea
and
seeing
the
basket
she
very
kindly
took
the
business
of
sprinkling
and
folding
upon
herself
this
gave
ellen
spirits
to
carry
out
a
plan
she
had
long
had
to
delight
the
whole
family
with
some
eggs
scrambled
in
fashion
after
the
milk
was
strained
and
put
away
she
went
about
it
while
nancy
set
the
table
a
nice
bed
of
coals
was
prepared
the
spider
set
over
them
the
eggs
broken
in
peppered
and
salted
and
she
began
carefully
to
stir
them
as
she
had
seen
margery
do
but
instead
of
acting
right
the
eggs
maliciously
stuck
fast
to
the
spider
and
burned
ellen
was
confounded
how
much
butter
did
you
put
in
said
van
brunt
who
had
come
in
and
stood
looking
on
butter
said
ellen
looking
up
oh
i
forgot
all
about
it
i
ought
to
have
put
that
in
ought
i
i
sorry
never

van
brunt
worth
your
being
sorry
about

nancy
clean
off
this
spider
and
we
try
again
at
this
moment
miss
fortune
was
heard
screaming
ellen
ran
up
what
did
she
want
said
van
brunt
when
she
came
down
again
she
wanted
to
know
what
was
burning
did
you
tell
her
yes
well
what
did
she
say
said
i
must
use
any
more
eggs
without
asking
her
that
ai
fair
play

van
brunt

nancy
now
ellen
here
the
spider
try
again
let
have
plenty
of
butter
in
this
time
and
plenty
of
eggs
too
this
time
the
eggs
were
scrambled
to
a
nicety
and
the
supper
met
with
great
favour
from
all
parties
ellen
day
was
done
when
the
dishes
were
the
whole
family
went
early
to
bed
she
was
weary
but
she
could
rest
well
she
had
made
her
old
grandmother
comfortable
she
had
kept
the
peace
with
nancy
she
had
pleased
van
brunt
she
had
faithfully
served
her
aunt
her
sleep
was
uncrossed
by
a
dream
untroubled
by
a
single
jar
of
conscience
and
her
awaking
to
another
day
of
labour
though
by
no
means
joyful
was
yet
not
unhopeful
or
unhappy
she
had
a
hard
trial
a
day
or
two
after
it
was
in
the
end
of
the
afternoon
she
had
her
big
apron
on
and
was
in
the
buttery
skimming
the
milk
when
she
heard
the
kitchen
door
open
and
footsteps
enter
the
kitchen
out
went
little
ellen
to
see
who
it
was
and
there
stood
alice
and
old
marshman
he
was
going
to
take
alice
home
with
him
the
next
morning
and
wanted
ellen
to
go
too
and
they
had
come
to
ask
her
ellen
knew
it
was
impossible
that
is
that
it
would
not
be
right
and
she
said
so
and
in
spite
of
alice
wistful
look
and
insisting
she
stood
her
ground
not
without
some
difficulty
and
some
glistening
of
the
eyes
they
had
to
give
it
up
marshman
then
wanted
to
know
what
she
meant
by
swallowing
herself
up
in
an
apron
in
that
sort
of
way
so
ellen
had
him
into
the
buttery
and
showed
him
what
she
had
been
about
he
would
see
her
skim
several
pans
and
laughed
at
her
prodigiously
though
there
was
a
queer
look
about
his
eyes
too
all
the
time
and
when
he
went
away
he
held
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
again
and
again
and
said
that
some
of
these
days
he
would
take
her
away
from
her
aunt
and
she
should
have
her
no
more
ellen
stood
and
looked
after
them
till
they
were
out
of
sight
and
then
went
upstairs
and
had
a
good
cry
the
soon
became
quite
too
much
for
ellen
to
manage
so
jane
huff
and
jenny
hitchcock
were
engaged
to
come
by
turns
and
do
the
heavy
part
of
it
all
within
the
buttery
being
still
left
to
ellen
for
miss
fortune
would
have
no
one
else
go
there
it
was
a
great
help
to
have
them
take
even
so
much
off
her
hands
and
they
often
did
some
other
little
odd
jobs
for
her
the
milk
however
seemed
to
increase
as
fast
as
the
days
grew
longer
and
ellen
could
not
find
that
she
was
much
less
busy
the
days
were
growing
pleasant
too
soft
airs
began
to
come
the
grass
was
of
a
beautiful
green
the
buds
on
the
branches
began
to
swell
and
on
some
trees
to
put
out
when
ellen
had
a
moment
of
time
she
used
to
run
across
the
to
the
barn
or
round
the
garden
or
down
to
the
brook
and
drink
in
the
sweet
air
and
the
lovely
sights
which
never
had
seemed
quite
so
lovely
before
if
once
in
a
while
she
could
get
before
tea
she
used
to
take
her
book
and
sit
down
on
the
threshold
of
the
front
door
or
on
the
big
log
under
the
in
the
in
those
minutes
the
reading
was
doubly
sweet
or
else
the
loveliness
of
earth
and
sky
was
such
that
ellen
could
not
take
her
eyes
from
them
till
she
saw
sam
or
johnny
coming
out
of
the
door
with
the
pails
of
milk
or
heard
their
heavy
tramp
over
the
chips
then
she
had
to
jump
and
run
those
were
sweet
ellen
did
not
at
first
know
how
much
reason
she
had
to
be
delighted
with
her
pilgrim
progress
she
saw
to
be
sure
that
it
was
a
fine
copy
well
bound
with
beautiful
cuts
but
when
she
came
to
look
further
she
found
all
through
the
book
on
the
margin
or
at
the
bottom
of
the
leaves
in
john
beautiful
handwriting
a
great
many
notes
simple
short
plain
exactly
what
was
needed
to
open
the
whole
book
to
her
and
make
it
of
the
greatest
possible
use
and
pleasure
many
things
she
remembered
hearing
from
his
lips
when
they
were
reading
it
together
there
was
a
large
part
of
the
book
where
all
was
new
the
part
he
had
not
had
time
to
finish
how
ellen
loved
the
book
and
the
giver
when
she
found
those
beautiful
notes
it
is
impossible
to
tell
she
counted
it
her
greatest
treasure
next
to
her
little
red
bible
chapter
xxxvi
oh

old
song
in
the
course
of
time
miss
fortune
showed
signs
of
mending
and
at
last
towards
the
latter
end
of
april
she
was
able
to
come
downstairs
all
parties
hailed
this
event
for
different
reasons
even
nancy
was
grown
tired
of
her
regular
life
and
willing
to
have
a
change
ellen
joy
was
however
soon
diminished
by
the
terrible
rummaging
which
took
place
miss
fortune
hands
were
yet
obliged
to
lie
still
but
her
eyes
did
double
duty
were
never
known
to
be
idle
in
the
best
of
times
and
it
seemed
to
ellen
now
as
if
they
were
taking
amends
for
all
their
weeks
of
forced
rest
oh
those
eyes
dust
was
found
where
ellen
had
never
dreamed
of
looking
for
any
things
were
said
to
be
dreadfully
in
the
way
where
she
had
never
found
it
out
disorder
and
dirt
were
groaned
over
where
ellen
did
not
know
the
fact
or
was
utterly
ignorant
how
to
help
it
waste
was
suspected
where
none
had
been
and
carelessness
charged
where
rather
praise
was
due
impatient
to
have
things
to
her
mind
and
as
yet
unable
to
do
anything
herself
miss
fortune
kept
nancy
and
ellen
running
till
both
wished
her
back
in
bed
and
even
van
brunt
grumbled
that
to
pay
ellen
for
having
grown
white
and
poor
her
aunt
was
going
to
work
the
little
flesh
she
had
left
off
her
bones
it
was
rather
hard
to
bear
just
when
she
was
looking
for
ease
too
her
patience
and
temper
were
more
tried
than
in
all
those
weeks
before
but
if
there
was
small
pleasure
in
pleasing
her
aunt
ellen
did
earnestly
wish
to
please
god
she
struggled
against
ill
temper
prayed
against
it
and
though
she
often
blamed
herself
in
secret
she
did
so
go
through
that
week
as
to
call
forth
van
admiration
and
even
to
stir
a
little
the
conscience
of
her
aunt
van
brunt
comforted
her
with
the
remark
that
it
is
darkest
just
before
day
and
so
it
proved
before
the
week
was
at
an
end
miss
fortune
began
as
she
expressed
it
to
take
hold
jenny
hitchcock
and
jane
huff
were
excused
from
any
more
nancy
was
sent
away
ellen
labours
were
much
lightened
and
the
house
was
itself
again
the
third
of
may
came
for
the
first
time
in
near
two
months
ellen
found
in
the
afternoon
that
she
could
be
spared
awhile
there
was
no
need
to
think
twice
what
she
would
do
with
her
leisure
perhaps
margery
could
tell
her
something
of
alice
hastily
and
joyfully
she
exchanged
her
working
frock
for
a
merino
put
on
nice
shoes
and
stockings
and
ruffle
again
and
taking
her
bonnet
and
gloves
to
put
on
out
of
doors
away
she
ran
who
can
tell
how
pleasant
it
seemed
after
so
many
weeks
to
be
able
to
walk
abroad
again
and
to
walk
to
the
mountain
ellen
snuffed
the
sweet
air
skipped
on
the
green
sward
picked
nosegays
of
grass
and
dandelion
and
at
last
unable
to
contain
herself
set
off
to
run
fatigue
soon
brought
this
to
a
stop
then
she
walked
more
leisurely
on
enjoying
it
was
a
lovely
spring
day
ellen
eyes
were
gladdened
by
it
she
felt
thankful
in
her
heart
that
god
had
made
everything
so
beautiful
she
thought
it
was
pleasant
to
think
had
made
them
pleasant
to
see
in
them
everywhere
so
much
of
the
wisdom
and
power
and
goodness
of
him
she
looked
up
to
with
joy
as
her
best
friend
she
felt
quietly
happy
and
sure
he
would
take
care
of
her
then
a
thought
of
alice
came
into
her
head
she
set
off
to
run
again
and
kept
it
up
this
time
till
she
got
to
the
old
house
and
ran
round
the
corner
she
stopped
at
the
shed
door
and
went
through
into
the
lower
kitchen
why
miss
ellen
dear
exclaimed
margery
if
that
is
you
you
come
in
the
nick
of
time
how
you
do
i
am
glad
to
see
you
uncommon
glad
to
be
sure
what
witch
told
you
to
come
here
just
now
run
in
run
into
the
parlour
and
see
what
you
find
there
has
alice
come
back
cried
ellen
but
margery
only
laughed
and
said
run
in
up
the
steps
through
the
kitchen
and
across
the
hall
ellen
ran
burst
open
the
parlour
door
and
was
in
alice
arms
there
were
others
in
the
room
but
ellen
did
not
seem
to
know
it
clinging
to
her
and
holding
her
in
a
fast
glad
embrace
till
alice
bade
her
look
up
and
attend
to
somebody
else
and
then
she
was
seized
round
the
neck
by
little
ellen
chauncey
and
then
came
her
mother
and
then
miss
sophia
the
two
children
were
overjoyed
to
see
each
other
while
their
joy
was
touching
to
see
from
the
shade
of
sorrow
in
the
one
and
of
sympathy
in
the
other
ellen
was
scarcely
less
glad
to
see
kind
chauncey
miss
sophia
greeting
too
was
very
affectionate
but
ellen
returned
to
alice
and
rested
herself
in
her
lap
with
one
hand
round
her
neck
the
other
hand
being
in
little
ellen
grasp
and
now
you
are
happy
i
suppose
said
miss
sophia
when
they
were
thus
placed
very
said
ellen
smiling
ah
but
you
be
happier
said
ellen
chauncey
hush
ellen
said
miss
sophia
what
curious
things
children
are
you
did
expect
to
find
us
all
here
did
you
ellen
montgomery

said
ellen
drawing
alice
cheek
nearer
for
another
kiss
we
have
but
just
come
ellie
said
her
sister
i
should
not
have
been
long
in
finding
you

my
child

thin
you
have
got
oh
i
grow
fat
again
now
said
ellen
how
is
miss
fortune
oh
she
is
up
again
and
well
have
you
any
reason
to
expect
your
father
home
ellen
said
chauncey
yes
aunt
fortune
says
perhaps
he
will
be
here
in
a
week
then
you
are
very
happy
in
looking
forward
are
you
said
miss
sophia
not
noticing
the
cloud
that
had
come
over
ellen
brow
ellen
hesitated
coloured
coloured
more
and
finally
with
a
sudden
motion
hid
her
face
against
alice
when
did
he
sail
ellie
said
alice
gravely
in
the
he
said
he
would
the
of
april
oh
i
ca
help
it
exclaimed
ellen
failing
in
the
effort
to
control
herself
she
clasped
alice
as
if
she
feared
even
then
the
separating
hand
alice
bent
her
head
down
and
whispered
words
of
comfort
mamma
said
little
ellen
chauncey
under
her
breath
and
looking
solemn
to
the
last
degree
do
ellen
want
to
see
her
father
she
afraid
that
he
may
take
her
away
where
she
will
not
be
with
alice
any
more
and
you
know
she
has
no
mother
to
go
to
oh
said
ellen
with
a
very
enlightened
face
but
he
wo
will
he
i
hope
not
i
think
not
cheered
again
the
little
girl
drew
near
and
silently
took
one
of
ellen
hands
we
shall
not
be
parted
ellie
said
alice
you
need
not
fear
if
your
father
takes
you
away
from
your
aunt
fortune
i
think
it
will
be
only
to
give
you
to
me
you
need
not
fear
yet
mamma
says
so
too
ellen
said
her
little
friend
this
was
strong
consolation
ellen
looked
up
and
smiled
now
come
with
me
said
ellen
chauncey
pulling
her
hand
i
want
you
to
show
me
something
let
go
down
to
the
garden
come
exercise
is
good
for
you
no
no
said
her
mother
smiling
ellen
has
had
exercise
enough
lately
you
must
take
her
down
to
the
garden
now
you
would
find
nothing
there
come
here
a
long
whisper
followed
which
seemed
to
satisfy
little
ellen
and
she
ran
out
of
the
room
some
time
passed
in
pleasant
talk
and
telling
all
that
had
happened
since
they
had
seen
each
other
then
little
ellen
came
back
and
called
ellen
montgomery
to
the
glass
door
saying
she
wanted
her
to
look
at
something
it
is
only
a
horse
we
brought
with
us
said
miss
sophia
ellen
thinks
it
is
a
great
beauty
and
ca
rest
till
you
have
seen
it
ellen
went
accordingly
to
the
door
there
to
be
sure
was
thomas
before
it
holding
a
pony
bridled
and
saddled
he
was
certainly
a
very
pretty
little
creature
brown
all
over
except
one
white
forefoot
his
coat
shone
it
was
so
glossy
his
limbs
were
fine
his
eye
gentle
and
bright
his
tail
long
enough
to
please
the
children
he
stood
as
quiet
as
a
lamb
whether
thomas
held
him
or
not
oh
what
a
beauty
said
ellen
what
a
lovely
little
horse
ai
he
said
ellen
chauncey
and
he
goes
so
beautifully
besides
and
never
starts
nor
nothing
and
he
is
as
as
a
little
dog
as
a
little
dog
she
means
ellen
said
miss
sophia
there
are
little
dogs
of
very
various
character
well
he
looks
said
ellen
what
a
pretty
head
and
what
a
beautiful
new
and
all
i
never
saw
such
a
dear
little
horse
in
my
life
is
it
yours
alice
no
said
alice
it
is
a
present
to
a
friend
of
mr
marshman
she
be
a
very
happy
friend
i
should
think
said
ellen
that
what
i
said
said
ellen
chauncey
dancing
up
and
down
what
i
said
i
said
you
be
happier
did
i
i
said
ellen
colouring
yes

are
the
friend
it
is
for
it
for
you
it
for
you
you
are
grandpa
friend
are
you
she
repeated
springing
upon
ellen
and
hugging
her
up
in
an
ecstasy
of
delight
but
it
is
really
for
me
is
it
said
ellen
now
looking
almost
pale
o
alice
come
come
said
miss
sophia
what
will
papa
say
if
i
tell
him
you
received
his
present
so
come
hold
up
your
head
put
on
your
bonnet
and
try
him
come
ellen
let
see
you
ellen
did
not
know
whether
to
cry
or
laugh
till
she
mounted
the
pretty
pony
that
settled
the
matter
not
ellen
chauncey
unspeakable
delight
was
as
great
as
her
own
she
rode
slowly
up
and
down
before
the
house
and
once
agoing
would
not
have
known
how
to
stop
if
she
had
not
recollected
that
the
pony
had
travelled
thirty
miles
that
day
and
must
be
tired
ellen
took
not
another
turn
after
that
she
jumped
down
and
begged
thomas
to
take
the
tenderest
care
of
him
patted
his
neck
ran
into
the
kitchen
to
beg
of
margery
a
piece
of
bread
to
give
him
from
her
hand
examined
the
new
stirrup
and
housings
and
the
pony
all
over
a
dozen
times
and
after
watching
him
as
thomas
led
him
off
till
he
was
out
of
sight
finally
came
back
into
the
house
with
a
face
of
marvellous
contentment
she
tried
to
fashion
some
message
of
thanks
for
the
kind
giver
of
the
pony
but
she
wanted
to
express
so
much
that
no
words
would
do
chauncey
however
smiled
and
assured
her
she
knew
exactly
what
to
say
that
pony
has
been
destined
for
you
ellen
she
said
this
year
and
more
but
my
father
waited
to
have
him
thoroughly
well
broken
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
him
he
is
perfectly
gentle
and
if
he
had
not
been
sure
of
that
my
father
would
never
have
sent
him
though
john
making
such
a
horsewoman
of
you
i
wish
i
could
thank
him
said
ellen
but
i
do
know
how
what
will
you
call
him
ellen
said
miss
sophia
my
father
has
dubbed
him
marshman
he
says
you
will
like
that
as
my
brother
is
such
a
favourite
of
yours
he
did
did
he
said
ellen
looking
from
sophia
to
alice
i
need
call
him
that
need
i
not
unless
you
like
said
miss
sophia
laughing
you
may
change
it
but
what
you
call
him
i
do
know
said
ellen
very
gravely
he
must
have
a
name
to
be
sure
but
why
do
you
call
him
that
said
ellen
chauncey
george
is
a
very
pretty
name
i
like
that
i
should
call
him
george
oh
i
could
said
ellen
i
could
call
him
so
i
should
like
it
at
all
george
washington
said
chauncey
no
indeed
said
ellen
i
guess
i
would
why
is
it
too
good
or
not
good
enough
said
miss
sophia
too
good
a
great
deal
too
good
for
a
horse
i
would
for
anything
how
would
brandywine
do
then
since
you
are
so
patriotic
said
miss
sophia
looking
amused
what
is
said
ellen
a
patriot
ellen
said
alice
smiling
is
one
who
has
a
strong
and
true
love
for
his
country
i
do
know
whether
i
am
patriotic
said
ellen
but
i
wo
call
him
brandywine
why
miss
sophia
no
i
would
either
said
ellen
chauncey
it
is
a
pretty
name
call
him
like
miss
angell
pony
that
pretty
no
no
nonsense
said
miss
sophia
call
him
benedict
arnold
ellen
and
then
it
will
be
a
relief
to
your
mind
to
whip
him
whip
him
said
ellen
i
do
want
to
whip
him
i
am
sure
and
i
should
be
afraid
to
besides
has
john
taught
you
that
lesson
yet
said
the
young
lady
he
is
perfect
in
it
himself
do
you
remember
alice
the
chastising
he
gave
that
fine
black
horse
of
ours
we
called
the
prince
a
beautiful
creature
he
was
more
than
a
year
ago
my
conscience
he
frightened
me
to
death
i
remember
said
alice
i
remember
i
could
not
look
on
what
did
he
do
that
for
said
ellen
what
the
matter
ellen
montgomery
said
miss
sophia
laughing
where
did
you
get
that
long
face
from
are
you
thinking
of
john
or
the
horse
ellen
eye
turned
to
alice
my
dear
ellen
said
alice
smiling
though
she
spoke
seriously
it
was
necessary
it
sometimes
is
necessary
to
do
such
things
you
do
not
suppose
john
would
do
it
cruelly
or
unnecessarily
ellen
face
shortened
considerably
but
what
had
the
horse
been
doing
he
had
not
been
doing
anything
he
would
do
that
was
the
trouble
he
was
as
obstinate
as
a
mule
my
dear
ellen
said
alice
it
was
no
such
terrible
matter
as
words
have
made
you
believe
it
was
a
clear
case
of
obstinacy
the
horse
was
resolved
to
have
his
own
way
and
not
to
do
what
his
rider
required
of
him
it
was
necessary
that
either
the
horse
or
the
man
should
give
up
and
as
john
has
no
fancy
for
giving
up
he
carried
his
point
partly
by
management
partly
i
confess
by
a
judicious
use
of
the
whip
and
spur
but
there
was
no
such
furious
flagellation
as
sophia
seems
to
mean
and
which
a
good
horseman
would
scarce
be
guilty
of
a
very
determined
said
miss
sophia
i
advise
you
ellen
not
to
trust
your
pony
to
john
he
have
no
mercy
on
him
sophia
is
laughing
ellen
said
alice
you
and
i
know
john
do
we
not
then
he
did
right
said
ellen
perfectly
right
except
in
mounting
the
horse
at
all
which
i
never
wished
him
to
do
no
one
on
the
place
would
ride
him
he
carried
john
beautifully
all
the
day
after
that
though
said
miss
sophia
and
i
dare
say
he
might
have
ridden
him
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
if
you
would
have
let
papa
give
him
to
him
but
he
was
of
no
use
to
anybody
else
howard
could
manage
him
i
suppose
he
was
too
lazy
papa
was
delighted
enough
that
day
to
have
given
john
anything
and
i
can
tell
you
black
prince
the
second
is
spirited
enough
i
am
afraid
you
wo
like
him
john
has
a
present
of
a
horse
too
ellen
said
alice
has
he
from
mr
marshman
yes
i
am
very
glad
oh
what
rides
we
can
take
now
ca
we
alice
we
sha
want
to
borrow
jenny
pony
any
more
what
kind
of
a
horse
is
mr
john
black
perfectly
black
is
he
handsome
very
is
his
name
black
prince
yes
ellen
began
to
consider
the
possibility
of
calling
her
pony
the
brown
princess
or
by
some
similar
title
the
name
of
john
two
charges
seeming
the
very
most
striking
a
horse
could
be
known
by
do
forget
alice
said
chauncey
to
tell
john
to
stop
for
him
on
his
way
home
it
will
give
us
a
chance
of
seeing
him
which
is
not
a
common
pleasure
in
any
sense
of
the
term
they
went
back
to
the
subject
of
the
name
which
ellen
pondered
with
uneasy
visions
of
john
and
her
poor
pony
flitting
through
her
head
the
little
horse
was
hard
to
fit
or
else
ellen
taste
was
very
hard
to
suit
a
great
many
names
were
proposed
none
of
which
were
to
her
mind
charley
and
cherry
and
brown
and
dash
and
jumper
but
she
said
they
had
john
and
jenny
already
in
thirlwall
and
she
did
want
a
charley
brown
was
not
pretty
and
she
hoped
he
would
dash
at
anything
nor
be
a
jumper
when
she
was
on
his
back
cherry
she
mused
awhile
about
but
it
would
do
call
him
fairy
said
ellen
chauncey
that
a
pretty
name
mamma
says
she
used
to
have
a
horse
called
fairy
do
ellen
call
him
fairy
no
said
ellen
he
ca
have
a
lady
name
that
the
trouble
i
have
it
ellen
said
alice
i
have
a
name
for
you
call
him
brownie
brownie
said
ellen
yes
brownies
are
male
fairies
and
brown
is
his
colour
so
how
will
that
do
it
was
soon
decided
that
it
would
do
very
well
it
was
simple
descriptive
and
not
common
ellen
made
up
her
mind
that
the
brownie
should
be
his
name
no
sooner
given
it
began
to
grow
dear
ellen
face
quitted
its
look
of
anxious
gravity
and
came
out
into
the
broadest
and
fullest
satisfaction
she
never
showed
joy
boisterously
but
there
was
a
light
in
her
eye
which
brought
many
a
smile
into
those
of
her
friends
as
they
sat
round
the
after
tea
it
was
necessary
to
go
home
much
to
the
sorrow
of
all
parties
ellen
knew
however
it
would
not
do
to
stay
miss
fortune
was
but
just
got
well
and
perhaps
already
thinking
herself
she
put
on
her
things
are
you
going
to
take
your
pony
home
with
you
inquired
miss
sophia
oh
no
not
i
must
see
about
a
place
for
him
and
besides
poor
fellow
he
is
tired
i
dare
say
i
do
believe
you
would
take
more
care
of
his
legs
than
of
your
own
said
miss
sophia
but
you
be
here
early
ellie
oh
wo
i
exclaimed
ellen
as
she
sprang
to
alice
neck
as
early
as
i
can
at
least
i
do
know
when
aunt
fortune
will
have
done
with
me
the
way
home
seemed
as
nothing
if
she
was
tired
she
did
not
know
it
the
brownie
the
brownie
the
thought
of
him
carried
her
as
cleverly
over
the
ground
as
his
very
back
would
have
done
she
came
running
into
the
hollo
cried
van
brunt
who
was
standing
under
the
cutting
a
piece
of
wood
for
the
tongue
of
the
which
had
been
broken
i
glad
to
see
you
run
i
was
afeard
you
hardly
be
able
to
stand
by
this
time
but
there
you
come
like
a
young
deer
oh
van
brunt
said
ellen
coming
close
up
to
him
and
speaking
in
an
undertone
you
do
know
what
a
present
i
have
had
what
do
you
think
marshman
has
sent
me
from
ventnor
could
guess
said
van
brunt
resting
the
end
of
his
pole
on
the
log
and
chipping
at
it
with
his
hatchet
never
guessed
anything
in
my
life
what
is
it
he
has
sent
me
the
most
beautiful
little
horse
you
ever
saw
for
my
own
for
me
to
ride
and
a
new
beautiful
saddle
and
bridle
you
never
saw
anything
so
beautiful
van
brunt
he
is
all
brown
with
one
white
forefoot
and
i
named
him
brownie
and
oh
van
brunt
do
you
think
aunt
fortune
will
let
him
come
here
van
brunt
chipped
away
at
his
pole
and
was
looking
very
because
you
know
i
could
have
half
the
good
of
him
if
he
had
to
stay
away
from
me
up
on
the
mountain
i
shall
want
to
ride
him
every
day
do
you
think
aunt
fortune
will
let
him
be
kept
here
van
brunt
i
guess
she
will
said
van
brunt
soberly
and
his
tone
said
to
ellen
will
if
she
do
then
will
you
ask
her
and
see
about
it
if
you
please
van
brunt
i
rather
you
would
and
you
wo
have
him
put
to
plough
or
anything
will
you
van
brunt
miss
sophia
says
it
would
spoil
him
i
plough
myself
first
said
van
brunt
with
his
half
smile
there
be
a
hair
of
his
coat
turned
the
wrong
way
see
to
him
as
if
he
was
a
prince
oh
thank
you
dear
van
brunt
how
good
you
are
then
i
shall
not
speak
about
him
at
all
till
you
do
remember
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
van
brunt
ellen
ran
in
she
got
a
chiding
for
her
long
stay
but
it
fell
upon
ears
that
could
not
hear
the
brownie
came
like
a
shield
between
her
and
all
trouble
she
smiled
at
her
aunt
hard
words
as
if
they
had
been
and
her
sleep
that
night
might
have
been
prairie
land
for
the
multitude
of
horses
of
all
sorts
that
chased
through
it
have
you
heerd
the
news
said
van
brunt
when
he
had
got
his
second
cup
of
coffee
at
breakfast
next
morning
no
said
miss
fortune
what
news
there
ai
as
much
news
as
there
used
to
be
when
i
was
young
said
the
old
lady
seems
to
me

splendid

present

some
of

marshman
there

the
country
as
i
heerd
tell
and
i
expect
next
thing
she
be
flying
over
all
the
fields
and
fences
like
smoke
there
was
a
meaning
silence
ellen
heart
beat
what
going
to
be
done
with
him
do
you
suppose
said
miss
fortune
her
look
said
if
you
think
i
am
coming
round
you
are
mistaken
humph
said
van
brunt
slowly
i
he
eat
grass
in
the
meadow
and
there
be
a
place
fixed
for
him
in
the
stables
not
in
stables
said
the
lady
shortly
no
in
mine
said
van
brunt
half
smiling
and
i
settle
with
you
about
it
when
we
square
up
our
accounts
miss
fortune
was
very
much
vexed
ellen
could
see
that
but
she
said
no
more
good
or
bad
about
the
matter
so
the
brownie
was
allowed
to
take
quiet
possession
of
meadow
and
stables
to
his
mistress
unbounded
joy
anybody
that
knew
van
brunt
would
have
been
surprised
to
hear
what
he
said
that
morning
for
he
was
thought
to
be
quite
as
keen
a
looker
after
the
main
chance
as
miss
fortune
herself
only
somehow
it
was
never
laid
against
him
as
it
was
against
her
however
that
might
be
it
was
plain
he
took
pleasure
in
keeping
his
word
about
the
pony
ellen
herself
could
not
have
asked
more
careful
kindness
for
her
favourite
than
the
brownie
had
from
every
man
and
boy
about
the
farm
chapter
xxxvii
thou
must
run
to
him
for
thou
hast
stayed
so
long
that
going
will
scarce
serve
the
shakespeare
captain
montgomery
did
come
the
next
week
nor
the
week
after
and
what
is
more
the
as
his
sister
called
the
ship
in
which
he
had
taken
passage
was
never
heard
of
from
that
time
she
sailed
duly
on
the
of
april
as
they
learned
from
the
papers
but
whatever
became
of
her
she
never
reached
port
it
remained
a
doubt
whether
captain
montgomery
had
actually
gone
in
her
and
ellen
had
many
weeks
of
anxious
watching
first
for
himself
and
then
for
news
of
him
in
case
he
were
still
in
france
none
ever
came
anxiety
gradually
faded
into
uncertainty
and
by
midsummer
no
doubt
of
the
truth
remained
in
any
mind
if
captain
montgomery
had
been
alive
he
would
certainly
have
written
if
not
before
on
learning
the
fate
of
the
vessel
in
which
he
had
told
his
friends
to
expect
him
home
ellen
rather
felt
that
she
was
an
orphan
than
that
she
had
lost
her
father
she
had
never
learned
to
love
him
he
had
never
given
her
much
cause
comparatively
a
small
portion
of
her
life
had
been
passed
in
his
society
and
she
looked
back
to
it
as
the
least
agreeable
of
all
and
it
had
not
been
possible
for
her
to
expect
with
pleasure
his
return
to
america
and
visit
to
thirlwall
she
dreaded
it
life
had
nothing
now
worse
for
her
than
a
separation
from
alice
and
john
humphreys
she
feared
her
father
might
take
her
away
and
put
her
in
some
dreadful
or
carry
her
about
the
world
wherever
he
went
a
wretched
wanderer
from
everything
good
and
pleasant
the
knowledge
of
his
death
had
less
pain
for
her
than
the
removal
of
this
fear
brought
relief
ellen
felt
sometimes
soberly
and
sadly
that
she
was
thrown
upon
the
wide
world
now
to
all
intents
and
purposes
so
she
had
been
a
year
and
before
but
it
was
something
to
have
a
father
and
mother
living
even
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
now
miss
fortune
was
her
sole
guardian
and
owner
however
she
could
hardly
realise
that
with
alice
and
john
so
near
at
hand
without
reasoning
much
about
it
she
felt
tolerably
secure
that
they
would
take
care
of
her
interests
and
make
good
their
claim
to
interfere
if
ever
need
were
ellen
and
her
little
horse
grew
more
and
more
fond
of
each
other
this
friendship
no
doubt
was
a
comfort
to
the
brownie
but
to
his
mistress
it
made
a
large
part
of
the
pleasure
of
her
everyday
life
to
visit
him
was
her
delight
at
all
hours
early
and
late
and
it
is
to
the
credit
that
he
always
seemed
as
glad
to
see
her
as
she
was
to
see
him
at
any
time
ellen
voice
would
bring
him
from
the
far
end
of
the
meadow
where
he
was
allowed
to
run
he
would
come
trotting
up
at
her
call
and
stand
to
have
her
scratch
his
forehead
or
pat
him
and
talk
to
him
and
though
the
brownie
could
not
answer
her
speeches
he
certainly
seemed
to
hear
them
with
pleasure
then
throwing
up
his
head
he
would
bound
off
take
a
turn
in
the
field
and
come
back
again
to
stand
as
still
as
a
lamb
as
long
as
she
stayed
there
herself
now
and
then
when
she
had
a
little
more
time
she
would
cross
the
fence
and
take
a
walk
with
him
and
there
with
his
nose
just
at
her
elbow
wherever
she
went
the
brownie
went
after
her
after
a
while
there
was
no
need
that
she
should
call
him
if
he
saw
or
heard
her
at
a
distance
it
was
enough
he
would
come
running
up
directly
ellen
loved
him
dearly
she
gave
him
more
proof
of
it
than
words
and
caresses
many
were
the
apples
and
scraps
of
bread
hoarded
up
for
him
and
if
these
failed
ellen
sometimes
took
him
a
little
salt
to
show
that
he
was
not
forgotten
there
were
not
certainly
many
scraps
left
at
miss
table
nor
apples
to
be
had
at
home
for
such
a
purpose
except
what
she
gathered
up
from
the
poor
ones
that
were
left
under
the
trees
for
the
hogs
but
ellen
had
other
sources
of
supply
once
she
had
begged
from
jenny
hitchcock
a
waste
bit
that
she
was
going
to
throw
away
jenny
found
what
she
wanted
to
do
with
it
and
after
that
many
a
basket
of
apples
and
many
a
piece
of
cold
was
set
by
for
her
margery
too
remembered
the
brownie
when
disposing
of
her
odds
and
ends
likewise
did
van
brunt
so
that
among
them
all
ellen
seldom
wanted
something
to
give
him
marshman
did
not
know
what
happiness
he
was
bestowing
when
he
sent
her
that
little
horse
many
many
were
the
hours
of
enjoyment
she
had
upon
his
back
ellen
went
nowhere
but
upon
the
brownie
alice
made
her
a
of
dark
gingham
and
it
was
the
admiration
of
the
country
to
see
her
trotting
or
cantering
by
all
alone
and
always
looking
happy
ellen
soon
found
that
if
the
brownie
was
to
do
her
much
good
she
must
learn
to
saddle
and
bridle
him
herself
this
was
very
awkward
at
first
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
van
brunt
showed
her
how
to
manage
and
after
a
while
it
became
quite
easy
she
used
to
call
the
brownie
to
the
put
the
bridle
on
and
let
him
out
and
then
he
would
stand
motionless
before
her
while
she
fastened
the
saddle
on
looking
round
sometimes
as
if
to
make
sure
that
it
was
she
herself
and
giving
a
little
kind
of
satisfied
neigh
when
he
saw
that
it
was
ellen
heart
began
to
dance
as
soon
as
she
felt
him
moving
under
her
and
once
off
and
away
on
the
docile
and
spirited
little
animal
over
the
roads
through
the
lanes
up
and
down
the
hills
her
horse
her
only
companion
but
having
the
most
perfect
understanding
with
him
both
ellen
and
the
brownie
cast
care
to
the
winds
i
do
believe
said
van
brunt
that
critter
would
a
rather
have
ellen
on
his
back
than
not
he
was
the
brownie
next
best
friend
miss
fortune
never
said
anything
to
him
or
of
him
ellen
however
reaped
a
reward
for
her
faithful
steadiness
to
duty
while
her
aunt
was
ill
things
were
never
after
that
as
they
had
been
before
she
was
looked
on
with
a
different
eye
to
be
sure
miss
fortune
tasked
her
as
much
as
ever
spoke
as
sharply
was
as
ready
to
scold
if
anything
went
wrong
all
that
was
just
as
it
used
to
be
but
beneath
all
that
ellen
felt
with
great
satisfaction
that
she
was
trusted
and
believed
she
was
no
longer
an
interloper
in
everybody
way
she
was
not
watched
and
suspected
her
aunt
treated
her
as
one
of
the
family
and
a
person
to
be
depended
on
it
was
a
very
great
comfort
to
little
ellen
life
miss
fortune
even
owned
that
she
believed
she
was
an
honest
child
and
meant
to
do
right
a
great
deal
from
her
miss
fortune
was
never
over
forward
to
give
any
one
the
praise
of
ellen
now
went
out
and
came
in
without
feeling
she
was
an
alien
and
though
her
aunt
was
always
bent
on
keeping
herself
and
everybody
else
at
work
she
did
not
now
show
any
particular
desire
for
breaking
off
ellen
from
her
studies
and
was
generally
willing
when
the
work
was
pretty
well
done
up
that
she
should
saddle
the
brownie
and
be
off
to
alice
or
vawse
though
ellen
was
happy
it
was
a
sober
kind
of
happiness
the
sun
shining
behind
a
cloud
and
if
others
thought
her
so
it
was
not
because
she
laughed
loudly
or
wore
a
merry
face
i
ca
help
but
think
said
van
brunt
that
that
child
has
something
more
to
make
her
happy
than
what
she
gets
in
this
world
there
was
a
quilting
party
gathered
that
afternoon
at
van
house
there
is
no
doubt
of
that
neighbour
said
vawse
nobody
ever
found
enough
here
to
make
him
happy
yet
well
i
do
want
to
see
a
prettier
girl
than
that
said
lowndes
you
never
catch
her
working
at
home
or
riding
along
on
that
handsome
little
critter
of
that
she
a
pleasant
look
and
a
smile
for
you
and
as
pretty
behaved
as
can
be
i
never
see
her
look
sorrowful
but
once
ai
that
a
pretty
horse
said
mimy
lawson
seen
her
look
sorrowful
though
said
sarah
lowndes
i
been
up
at
the
house
when
miss
fortune
was
hustling
everybody
round
and
as
sharp
as
vinegar
and
you
think
it
would
take
job
patience
to
stand
it
and
for
all
there
would
be
a
bit
of
crossness
in
that
face
she
go
round
and
not
say
a
word
that
was
just
so
you
thought
her
bread
was
all
spread
with
honey
and
everybody
knows
it
ai
i
do
see
how
she
could
do
it
for
my
part
i
know
could
ah
neighbour
said
vawse
ellen
looks
higher
than
to
please
her
aunt
she
tries
to
please
her
god
and
one
can
bear
people
words
or
looks
when
one
is
pleasing
him
she
is
a
dear
child
and
there
said
van
brunt
he
thinks
the
hull
world
of
her
i
never
see
him
take
so
to
any
one
there
ai
an
airthly
thing
he
would
do
to
please
her
if
she
was
his
own
child
i
no
idee
he
could
set
her
up
more
than
he
does

well
said
nancy
coming
up
good
reason
ellen

set
up
any

i
wish

as
good
as

house
sure
enough
whoever
downstairs
bless
her
dear
little
heart
said
his
mother
a
good
name
is
better
than
precious
ointment
august
had
come
and
john
was
daily
expected
home
one
morning
miss
fortune
was
in
the
lower
kitchen
up
to
the
elbows
in
making
a
rich
fall
cheese
ellen
was
busy
upstairs
when
her
aunt
shouted
to
her
to
come
and
see
what
was
all
that
splashing
and
crashing
in
the
garden
ellen
ran
out
oh
aunt

said
she
timothy
has
broken
down
the
fence
and
got
in
timothy
said
miss
fortune
what
timothy
why
timothy
the
near
ox
said
ellen
laughing
he
has
knocked
down
the
fence
over
there
where
it
was
low

near

miss

so
near

time
mercy
he
be
at
the
corn
and
over
everything
run
and
drive
him
into
the
ca
you
but
ellen
stood
still
and
shook
her
head
he
would
stir
for
me
she
said
and
besides
i
am
as
afraid
of
that
ox
as
can
be
if
it
was
clover
i
would
mind
but
he
have
every
bit
of
the
corn
eaten
up
in
five
minutes
van
brunt
i
heard
him
say
he
was
going
home
till
noon
said
ellen
and
sam
larkens
is
gone
to
mill
and
johnny
low
is
laid
up
with
the
shakes
very
careless
of
van
brunt
said
miss
fortune
drawing
her
arms
out
of
the
wringing
off
the
whey
i
wish
he
mind
his
own
oxen
there
was
no
business
to
be
a
low
place
in
the
fence
well
come
along
you
ai
afraid
with
me
i
suppose
ellen
followed
at
a
respectful
distance
miss
fortune
however
feared
the
face
of
neither
man
nor
beast
she
pulled
up
a
bean
poll
and
made
such
a
show
of
fight
that
timothy
after
looking
at
her
a
little
fairly
turned
tail
and
marched
out
of
the
breach
he
had
made
miss
fortune
went
after
and
rested
not
till
she
had
driven
him
quite
into
the
meadow
get
him
into
the
she
could
not
you
ai
worth
a
straw
ellen
said
she
when
she
came
back
could
you
ha
headed
him
and
driv
him
into
the
now
that
plaguy
beast
will
just
be
back
again
by
the
time
i
get
well
to
work
he
done
much
mischief
yet
there
van
brunt
salary
he
made
a
pretty
mess
of
i
glad
o
he
should
ha
put
potatoes
as
i
told
him
i
do
know
what
to
be
done
i
ca
be
leaving
my
cheese
to
run
and
mind
the
garden
every
minute
if
it
was
full
of
timothys
and
be
scared
if
a
mosquito
flew
at
you
you
had
better
go
right
off
for
van
brunt
and
fetch
him
straight
home
serve
him
right
he
has
no
business
to
leave
things
so
run
along
and
do
let
the
grass
grow
under
your
feet
ellen
wisely
thought
her
pony
feet
would
do
the
business
quicker
she
ran
and
put
on
her
gingham
dress
and
saddled
and
bridled
the
brownie
in
three
minutes
but
before
setting
off
she
had
to
scream
to
her
aunt
that
timothy
was
just
coming
round
the
corner
of
the
barn
again
and
miss
fortune
rushed
out
to
the
garden
as
ellen
and
the
brownie
walked
down
to
the
gate
the
weather
was
fine
and
ellen
thought
to
herself
it
was
an
ill
wind
that
blew
no
good
she
was
getting
a
nice
ride
in
the
early
morning
that
she
would
not
have
had
but
for
timothy
lawless
behaviour
to
ride
at
that
time
was
particularly
pleasant
and
rare
and
forgetting
how
she
had
left
poor
miss
fortune
between
the
ox
and
the
ellen
and
the
brownie
cantered
on
in
excellent
spirits
she
looked
in
vain
as
she
passed
his
grounds
to
see
van
brunt
in
the
garden
or
about
the
barn
she
went
on
to
the
little
gate
of
the
courtyard
dismounted
and
led
the
brownie
in
here
she
was
met
by
nancy
who
came
running
from
the
way
of
the
how
d
do
nancy
said
ellen
where

brunt
goodness
ellen
what

you
want
i
want

he
out
in
the
barn
but
he
used
himself
up
used
himself
up
what
do
you
mean
why
he
fixed
himself
in
fine
style
he
fell
through
the
and
broke
his
leg
oh
nancy
screamed
ellen
he
has
how
could
he
why
easy
enough
if
he
did
look
where

floor
but
it

for

reins
hang
ellen
bent
over
his
neck
crying
bitterly
only
urging
him
now
and
then
to
greater
speed
till
at
length
the
feeling
that
she
had
something
to
do
came
to
her
help
she
straightened
herself
gathered
up
her
reins
and
by
the
time
she
reached
hitchcock
was
looking
calm
again
though
very
sad
and
very
earnest
she
did
not
alight
but
stopped
before
the
door
and
called
jenny
jenny
came
out
expressing
her
pleasure

i
came

only
a
little
while
after

guess
that
how
it
was
and
that
the
way
nancy
got
the
start
of
you
what
shall
i
do
said
ellen
she
could
not
bear
to
wait
till
they
returned
if
she
rode
back
she
might
miss
them
again
besides
the
delay
and
then
a
man
on
foot
would
make
a
long
journey
of
it
jenny
told
her
of
a
house
or
two
where
she
might
try
for
a
messenger
but
they
were
strangers
to
her
she
could
not
make
up
her
mind
to
ask
such
a
favour
of
them
her
friends
were
too
far
out
of
the
way
i
go
myself
she
said
suddenly
tell
dear
jenny
will
you
that
i
have
gone
for
gibson
and
that
i
bring
him
back
as
quick
as

can
i
know
the
road
to
thirlwall
but
ellen
you

said
jenny
i
am
afraid
to
have
you
go
all
that
way
alone
wait
till
the
men

back
they
wo
be
long
no
i
ca
jenny
said
ellen
i
ca
wait
i
must
go
you
be
afraid
tell
i
be
as
quick
as
i
can
but
see
ellen
cried
jenny
as
she
was
moving
off
i
do
like
to
have
you
i
must
jenny
never
mind
but
see
ellen
cried
jenny
again
if
you
go
if
you
find
gibson
just
get
marshchalk
he
every
bit
as
good
and
some
folks
think
he
better
he
do
just
as
well
ellen
nodded
and
rode
off
there
was
a
little
fluttering
of
the
heart
at
taking
so
much
upon
herself
she
had
never
been
to
thirlwall
but
once
since
the
first
time
she
saw
it
but
she
thought
of
van
brunt
suffering
for
help
which
could
not
be
obtained
and
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
hesitate
i
am
sure
i
am
doing
right
she
thought
and
what
is
there
to
be
afraid
of
if
i
ride
two
miles
alone
why
i
four
and
i
am
doing
right
god
will
take
care
of
me
ellen
earnestly
asked
him
to
do
so
and
after
that
she
felt
pretty
easy
now
dear
brownie
said
she
patting
his
neck
you
and
i
have
work
to
do
behave
like
a
good
little
horse
as
you
are
the
brownie
answered
with
a
little
cheerful
kind
of
neigh
as
much
as
to
say
never
fear
me
they
trotted
on
nicely
but
nothing
could
help
that
being
a
disagreeable
ride
do
what
she
would
ellen
felt
a
little
afraid
when
she
found
herself
on
a
long
piece
of
road
where
she
had
never
been
alone
before
there
were
not
many
houses
on
the
way
the
few
there
were
looked
strange
ellen
did
not
know
exactly
where
she
was
or
how
near
the
end
of
her
journey
it
seemed
a
long
one
she
felt
rather
lonely
a
little
shy
of
meeting
people
and
yet
a
little
unwilling
to
have
the
intervals
between
them
so
very
long
she
repeated
to
herself
i
am
doing
right
god
will
take
care
of
me
still
there
was
a
nervous
trembling
at
heart
sometimes
she
would
pat
her
pony
neck
and
say
trot
on
dear
brownie
we
soon
be
there
by
way
of
cheering
herself
for
certainly
the
brownie
needed
no
cheering
and
was
trotting
on
bravely
then
the
thought
of
van
brunt
as
she
had
seen
him
lying
on
the
barn
floor
made
her
feel
sick
and
miserable
many
tears
fell
during
her
ride
when
she
remembered
him
heaven
will
be
a
good
place
thought
little
ellen
as
she
went
there
will
be
no
sickness
no
pain
no
sorrow
but
van
brunt
i
wonder
if
he
is
fit
to
go
to
heaven
this
was
a
new
matter
of
thought
and
uneasiness
not
now
for
the
first
time
in
ellen
mind
and
so
the
time
passed
till
she
crossed
the
bridge
over
the
little
river
and
saw
the
houses
of
thirlwall
stretching
away
in
the
distance
then
she
felt
comfortable
long
before
she
had
bethought
her
that
she
did
not
know
where
to
find
gibson
and
had
forgotten
to
ask
jenny
for
one
instant
ellen
drew
bridle
but
it
was
too
far
to
go
back
and
she
recollected
anybody
could
tell
her
where
the
doctor
lived
when
she
got
to
thirlwall
however
ellen
found
that
she
did
not
like
to
ask
she
remembered
her
old
friend
forbes
of
the
star
inn
and
resolved
she
would
go
there
in
the
first
place
she
rode
slowly
up
the
street
and
looking
carefully
till
she
came
to
the
house
there
was
no
mistaking
it
there
was
the
very
same
big
star
over
the
front
door
that
had
caught
her
eye
from
the
and
there
was
the
very
same
boy
or
man
sam
lounging
on
the
sidewalk
ellen
reined
up
and
asked
him
to
ask
forbes
if
she
would
be
so
good
as
to
come
out
to
her
for
one
minute
sam
gave
her
a
long
yankee
look
and
disappeared
coming
back
again
directly
with
the
landlady
how
d
do
mrs
forbes
said
ellen
holding
out
her
hand
do
you

let
gibson
come
near
me
with
a
pair
of
tongs
but
anyhow
if

catch
him
thank

said
ellen
where

it
that
house
down

said
the
landlady
pointing
with
her
finger
where
ellen
saw
no
lack
of
houses
you
see
that
big
red
store
with
the
man
standing
out
in
front
the
next
white
house
below
that
is
mis
perriman
just
run
right
in
and
ask
for
gibson
dear
i
real
sorry
you
ca
come
in
that
first
white
house
glad
to
get
free
ellen
rode
smartly
down
to
the
nobody
before
the
door
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
get
off
here
and
go
in
she
did
not
know
the
people
either
never
mind
wait
for
me
a
minute
dear
brownie
like
a
good
little
horse
as
you
are
no
fear
of
the
brownie
he
stood
as
if
he
did
not
mean
to
budge
again
in
a
century
at
first
going
in
ellen
saw
nobody
in
the
presently
at
an
opening
in
a
kind
of
place
in
one
corner
a
face
looked
out
and
asked
what
she
wanted
is
gibson
here
no
said
the
owner
of
the
face
with
a
disagreeable
kind
of
smile
is
this
miss
perriman
house
you
are
in
the
right
box
my
dear
and
no
mistake
said
the
young
man
but
then
it
ai
gibson
house
you
know
can
you
tell
me
sir
where
i
can
find
him
ca
indeed
the
doctor
never
tells
me
where
he
is
going
and
i
never
ask
him
i
am
sorry
i
did
this
morning
for
your
sake
the
way
and
the
look
made
the
words
extremely
disagreeable
and
furthermore
ellen
had
an
uncomfortable
feeling
that
neither
was
new
to
her
where
she
seen
the
man
before
she
puzzled
herself
to
think
where
but
in
a
dream
had
she
seen
that
bold
face
that
horrible
smile
that
sandy
hair
she
knew
it
was
saunders
the
man
who
had
sold
her
the
merino
at
clair
fleury
she
knew
him
and
she
was
very
sorry
to
see
that
he
knew
her
all
she
desired
now
was
to
get
out
of
the
house
and
away
but
on
turning
she
saw
another
man
older
and
whose
face
encouraged
her
to
ask
again
if
gibson
was
there
he
was
not
the
man
said
he
had
been
there
and
gone
do
you
know
where
i
should
be
likely
to
find
him
sir
no
i
do
said
he
who
wants
him
i
want
to
see
him
sir
for
yourself
no
sir
van
brunt
has
broken
his
leg
and
wants
gibson
to
come
directly
and
set
it
van
brunt
said
he
farmer
van
brunt
that
lives
down
towards
the
cat
back
i
very
sorry
how
did
it
happen
ellen
told
as
shortly
as
possible
and
again
begged
to
know
where
she
might
look
for
gibson
well
said
he
the
best
plan
i
can
think
of
will
be
for
you
how
did
you
come
here
i
came
on
horseback
sir
ah
well
the
best
plan
will
be
for
you
to
ride
up
to
his
house
maybe
he
have
left
word
there
and
anyhow
can
leave
word
for
him
to
come
down
as
soon
as
he
gets
home
do
you
know
where
the
doctor
lives
no
sir
come
here
said
he
pulling
her
to
the
door
you
ca
see
it
from
here
but
you
must
ride
up
street
till
you
have
passed
two
churches
one
on
the
right
hand
first
and
then
a
good
piece
beyond
you
come
to
another
red
brick
one
on
the
left
hand
and
gibson
lives
in
the
next
block
but
one
after

on

other
side

he
did
not
seem
to

her
thanks
he
was
all
eyes
and
with
his
clerk
stood
looking
after
her
till
she
was
out
of
sight
poor
ellen
found
it
a
long
way
up
to
the
doctor

of
the
town
and
the
doctor
house
was
near
the
upper
she
passed
one
church
and
then
the
other
but
there
was
a
long
distance
between
or
what
she
thought
so
happily
the
brownie
did
not
seem
tired
at
all
his
little
mistress
tired
and
disheartened
too
and
there
all
this
time
was
poor
van
brunt
lying
without
a
doctor
she
could
not
bear
to
think
of
it
she
jumped
down
when
she
came

block

had
been
told
of

found
the
house

little
sup
of
dinner
for

the
rate
leander
will
dear
dear
to
think
of
poor
van
brunt
he
a
likely
man
too
i
very
sorry
for
him
and
his
poor
mother
a
kind
body
she
is
as
ever
the
sun
shined
upon
and
so
is
he
said
ellen
well
so
i
daresay
said
miss
janet
but
i
do
know
so
much
about
him
howsoever
he
got
everybody
good
word
as
far
as
i
know
he
a
likely
man
the
little
room
in
which
miss
janet
had
brought
ellen
was
very
plainly
furnished
indeed
but
as
neat
as
hands
could
make
it
the
carpet
was
as
crumbless
and
lintless
as
if
meals
were
never
taken
there
nor
work
seen
and
yet
a
little
table
ready
set
for
dinner
forbade
the
one
conclusion
and
a
huge
basket
of
naperies
in
one
corner
showed
that
miss
industry
did
not
spend
itself
in
housework
alone
before
the
fire
stood
a
pretty
kettle
and
a
very
appetising
smell
came
from
it
to
ellen
nose
in
spite
of
sorrow
and
anxiety
her
ride
had
made
her
hungry
it
was
not
without
pleasure
that
she
saw
her
kind
hostess
arm
herself
with
a
deep
plate
and
tin
dipper
and
carefully
taking
off
the
pot
cover
so
that
no
drops
might
fall
on
the
hearth
proceed
to
ladle
out
a
goodly
supply
of
what
ellen
knew
was
that
excellent
country
dish
called
excellent
it
is
when
well
made
and
that
was
miss
janet
the
pieces
of
crust
were
white
and
light
like
new
bread
the
very
of
the
meat
she
culled
out
for
ellen
and
the
poured
over
all
would
have
met
even
miss
fortune
wishes
from
its
just
degree
of
richness
and
exact
seasoning
smoking
hot
it
was
placed
before
ellen
on
a
little
stand
by
her
with
some
nice
bread
and
butter
and
presently
miss
janet
poured
her
out
a
cup
of
tea
for
she
said
leander
never
could
take
his
dinner
without
it
ellen
appetite
needed
no
silver
fork
tea
and
were
never
better
liked
yet
miss
janet
enjoyment
was
perhaps
greater
still
she
sat
talking
and
looking
at
her
little
visitor
with
secret
but
immense
satisfaction
have
you
heard
what
fine
doings
we
agoing
to
have
here
said
she
the
doctor
tired
of
me
he
going
to
get
a
new
housekeeper
he
going
to
get
married
some
of
these
days
is
he
said
ellen
not
to
jenny
yes
indeed
he
is
to
jenny
jenny
hitchcock
and
a
nice
little
wife
she
make
him
you
a
great
friend
of
jenny
i
know
how
soon
said
ellen
oh
not
just
yet
after
we
get
a
little
smarted
up
i
guess
before
a
great
while
do
you
think
he
be
a
happy
man
ellen
could
not
help
wondering
as
the
doctor
just
then
came
in
and
she
looked
up
at
his
unfortunate
face
whether
jenny
would
be
a
happy
woman
but
as
people
often
do
she
only
judged
from
the
outside
jenny
had
not
made
such
a
bad
choice
after
all
the
doctor
said
he
would
go
directly
to
van
brunt
after
he
had
been
over
to
sibnorth
it
would
be
a
minute
ellen
meant
to
ride
back
in
his
company
and
having
finished
her
dinner
waited
now
only
for
him
but
the
one
minute
passed
two
minutes
ten
twenty
she
waited
impatiently
but
he
came
not
i
tell
you
how
it
must
be
said
his
sister
he
gone
off
without
his
dinner
calculating
to
get
it
at
miss
hitchcock
he
be
glad
of
the
chance
that
how
it
is
dear
and
you
have
to
ride
home
alone
i
real
sorry
you
stop
till
evening
and
i
make
the
doctor
go
along
with
you
but
oh
dear
maybe
he
would
be
able
to
neither
he
got
to
go
up
to
that
tiresome
robin
it
too
bad
well
take
good
care
of
yourself
darling
could
you
stop
till
it
cooler
well
come
and
see
me
as
soon
as
you
can
again
but
do
come
without
some
one
else
along
i
wish
i
could
keep
you
she
went
to
the
door
to
see
her
mount
and
smiled
and
nodded
her
off
ellen
was
greatly
refreshed
with
her
rest
and
her
dinner
it
grieved
her
that
the
brownie
had
not
fared
as
well
all
the
refreshment
that
kind
words
and
patting
could
give
him
she
gave
promised
him
the
freshest
of
water
and
the
sweetest
of
hay
when
he
should
reach
home
and
begged
him
to
keep
up
his
spirits
and
hold
on
for
a
little
longer
it
may
be
doubted
whether
the
brownie
understood
the
full
sense
of
her
words
but
he
probably
knew
what
the
kind
tones
and
gentle
hand
meant
he
answered
cheerfully
threw
up
his
head
and
gave
a
little
neigh
as
much
as
to
say
was
going
to
mind
a
few
hours
of
sunshine
and
trotted
on
as
if
he
knew
his
face
was
towards
home
which
no
doubt
he
did
luckily
it
was
not
a
very
hot
day
for
august
it
was
remarkably
cool
and
beautiful
indeed
there
was
little
very
hot
weather
ever
known
in
thirlwall
ellen
heart
felt
easier
now
that
her
business
was
done
and
when
she
had
left
the
town
behind
her
and
was
again
in
the
fields
she
was
less
timid
than
she
had
been
before
she
was
going
towards
home
that
makes
a
great
difference
and
every
step
was
bringing
her
nearer
i
am
glad
i
came
after
all
she
thought
but
i
hope
i
shall
never
have
to
do
such
a
thing
again
but
i
am
glad
i
came
she
had
no
more
than
crossed
the
little
bridge
however
when
she
saw
what
brought
her
heart
into
her
mouth
it
was
saunders
lolling
under
it
tree
what
could
he
have
come
there
for
at
that
time
of
day
a
vague
feeling
crossed
her
mind
that
if
she
could
only
get
past
him
she
should
pass
a
danger
she
thought
to
ride
by
without
seeming
to
see
him
and
quietly
gave
the
brownie
a
pat
to
make
him
go
faster
but
as
she
drew
near
saunders
rose
up
came
to
the
middle
of
the
road
and
taking
hold
of
her
bridle
checked
her
pony
pace
so
that
he
could
walk
alongside
to
ellen
unspeakable
dismay
what
kept
you
so
long
said
he
i
been
looking
out
for
you
this
great
while
had
hard
work
to
find
the
doctor
wo
you
please
to
let
go
of
my
horse
said
ellen
her
heart
beating
very
fast
i
am
in
a
great
hurry
to
get
home
please
do
keep
me
oh
i
want
to
see
you
a
little
said
saunders
you
ai
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
away
from
me
as
that
comes
to
are
you
ellen
was
silent
it
quite
a
long
time
since
i
saw
you
last
said
he
how
have
the
merinoes
worn
ellen
could
not
bear
to
look
at
his
face
and
did
not
see
the
expression
which
went
with
these
words
yet
she
it
they
have
worn
very
well
said
she
but
i
want
to
get
home
very
much
let
me
go
not
yet
not
yet
said
he
oh
no
not
yet
i
want
to
talk
to
you
why
what
are
you
in
such
a
devil
of
a
hurry
for
i
came
out
on
purpose
do
you
think
i
am
going
to
have
all
my
long
waiting
for
nothing
ellen
did
not
know
what
to
say
her
heart
sprang
with
a
nameless
pang
to
the
thought
if
she
ever
got
free
from
this
meanwhile
she
was
not
free
whose
horse
is
that
you
on
mine
said
ellen
that
a
likely
story
i
guess
he
ai
and
so
you
wo
mind
if
i
touch
him
up
a
little
i
want
to
see
how
well
you
can
sit
on
a
horse
passing
his
arm
through
the
bridle
as
he
said
these
words
saunders
led
the
pony
down
to
the
side
of
the
road
where
grew
a
clump
of
high
bushes
and
with
some
trouble
cut
off
a
long
stout
sapling
ellen
looked
in
every
direction
while
he
was
doing
this
despairing
as
she
looked
of
aid
from
any
quarter
of
the
broad
quiet
open
country
oh
for
wings
but
she
could
not
leave
the
brownie
if
she
had
them
returning
to
the
middle
of
the
road
saunders
amused
himself
as
they
walked
along
with
stripping
off
all
the
leaves
and
little
twigs
from
his
sapling
leaving
it
when
done
a
very
good
imitation
of
an
in
size
and
length
with
a
fine
point
ellen
watched
him
in
an
ecstasy
of
apprehension
afraid
alike
to
speak
or
to
be
silent
there
what
do
you
think
of
that
said
he
giving
it
two
or
three
switches
in
the
air
to
try
its
suppleness
and
toughness
do
that
look
like
a
whip
now
we
see
how
he
go
please
do
do
anything
with
it
said
ellen
earnestly
i
never
touch
him
with
a
whip
he
does
need
it
he
is
used
to
it
pray
pray
do
not
oh
we
just
tickle
him
a
little
with
it
said
saunders
coolly
i
want
to
see
how
well
you
sit
him
just
make
him
caper
a
little
bit
he
accordingly
applied
the
switch
lightly
to
the
brownie
heels
enough
to
annoy
without
hurting
him
the
brownie
showed
signs
of
uneasiness
quitted
his
quiet
pace
and
took
to
little
starts
and
springs
and
whiskey
motions
most
unpleasing
to
his
rider
oh
do
not
cried
ellen
almost
beside
herself
he
very
spirited
and
i
do
know
what
he
will
do
if
you
trouble
him
you
let
me
take
care
of
that
said
saunders
if
he
troubles
i
give
it
to
him
if
he
rears
up
only
you
catch
hold
of
his
mane
and
hold
on
tight
and
you
wo
fall
off
i
want
to
see
him
rear
but
you
give
him
bad
tricks
said
ellen
oh
pray
do
do
so
it
very
bad
for
him
to
be
teased
i
am
afraid
he
will
kick
if
you
do
so
and
he
be
ruined
if
he
got
a
habit
of
kicking
oh
let
us
go
said
she
with
the
most
acute
accent
of
entreaty
i
want
to
be
home
you
keep
quiet
said
saunders
coolly
if
he
kicks
i
give
him
such
a
lathering
as
he
never
had
yet
he
wo
do
it
but
once
i
agoing
to
hurt
him
but
i
am
agoing
to
make
him
rear
no
i
wo
make
him
leap
over
a
rail
the
first
we
come
to
that
be
prettier
oh
you
must
do
that
said
ellen
i
have
not
learned
to
leap
yet
i
could
keep
on
you
must
do
that
if
you
please
you
just
hold
fast
and
hold
your
tongue
catch
hold
of
his
ears
and
you
stick
on
fast
enough
if
you
ca
you
may
get
down
for
i
am
going
to
make
him
take
the
leap
whether
you
will
or
no
ellen
feared
still
more
to
get
off
and
leave
the
brownie
to
her
tormentor
mercy
than
to
stay
where
she
was
and
take
her
chance
she
tried
in
vain
as
well
as
she
could
to
soothe
her
horse
the
touches
of
the
whip
coming
now
in
one
place
and
now
in
another
and
some
of
them
pretty
sharp
he
began
to
grow
very
frisky
indeed
and
she
began
to
be
very
much
frightened
for
fear
she
should
suddenly
be
jerked
off
with
a
good
deal
of
presence
of
mind
though
wrought
up
to
a
terrible
pitch
of
excitement
and
fear
ellen
gave
her
best
attention
to
keeping
her
seat
as
the
brownie
sprang
and
started
and
jumped
to
one
side
and
the
other
saunders
holding
the
bridle
as
loose
as
possible
so
as
to
give
him
plenty
of
room
for
some
little
time
he
amused
himself
with
this
game
the
horse
growing
more
and
more
irritated
at
length
a
smart
stroke
of
the
whip
upon
his
haunches
made
the
brownie
spring
in
a
way
that
brought
ellen
heart
into
her
mouth
and
almost
threw
her
off
oh
do
cried
ellen
bursting
into
tears
for
the
first
time
she
had
with
great
effort
commanded
them
back
until
now
poor
brownie
how
can
you
oh
please
let
us
go
please
let
us
go
for
one
minute
she
dropped
her
face
in
her
hands
be
quiet
said
saunders
here
a
now
for
the
leap
ellen
wiped
away
her
tears
forced
back
those
that
were
coming
and
began
the
most
earnest
remonstrance
and
pleading
with
saunders
that
she
knew
how
to
make
he
paid
her
no
sort
of
attention
he
led
the
brownie
to
the
side
of
the
road
let
down
all
the
bars
but
the
lower
two
let
go
the
bridle
and
stood
a
little
off
prepared
with
his
whip
to
force
the
horse
to
take
the
spring
i
tell
you
i
shall
fall
said
ellen
reining
him
back
how
can
you
be
so
cruel
i
want
to
go
home
well
you
ai
agoing
home
yet
get
off
if
you
are
afraid
said
saunders
but
though
trembling
in
every
nerve
from
head
to
foot
ellen
fancied
the
brownie
was
safer
so
long
as
he
had
her
on
his
back
she
would
not
leave
him
she
pleaded
her
best
which
saunders
heard
as
if
it
was
amusing
and
without
making
any
answer
kept
the
horse
capering
in
front
of
the
bars
pretending
every
minute
he
was
going
to
whip
him
up
to
take
the
leap
his
object
however
was
merely
to
gratify
the
smallest
of
minds
by
teasing
a
child
he
had
a
spite
against
he
had
no
intention
to
risk
breaking
her
bones
by
a
fall
from
her
horse
so
in
time
he
had
enough
of
the
took
the
bridle
again
and
walked
on
ellen
drew
breath
a
little
more
freely
did
you
hear
how
i
handled
your
old
gentleman
after
that
time
said
saunders
ellen
made
no
answer
no
one
ever
affronts
me
that
do
hear
news
of
it
afterwards
and
so
he
found
to
his
cost
paid
him
off
to
my
heart
content
i
gave
the
old
fellow
a
lesson
to
behave
in
future
i
forgive
him
now
entirely
by
the
way
i
a
little
account
to
settle
with
you
did
you
ask
perriman
this
morning
if
gibson
was
in
the
house
i
do
know
who
it
was
said
ellen
well
had
i
told
you
just
before
he
war
there
ellen
was
silent
what
did
you
do
that
for
eh
did
you
believe
me
still
she
did
not
speak
i
say
said
saunders
touching
the
brownie
as
he
spoke
did
you
think
i
told
you
a
lie
about
it
eh
i
did
know
but
he
might
be
there
ellen
forced
herself
to
say
then
you
did
believe
me
said
he
always
with
that
same
smile
upon
his
face
ellen
knew
that
now
that
war
handsome
of
you
and
i
am
agoing
to
punish
you
for
it
somehow
or
but
it
ai
pretty
to
quarrel
with
ladies
so
brownie
and
me
settle
it
together
you
wo
mind
that
i
dare
say
what
are
you
going
to
do
said
ellen
as
he
once
more
drew
her
down
to
the
side
of
the
fence
get
off
and
you
see
said
he
laughing
get
off
and
you
see
what
do
you
want
to
do
repeated
ellen
though
scarce
able
to
speak
the
words
i
just
going
to
tickle
brownie
a
little
to
teach
you
to
believe
honest
folks
when
they
speak
the
truth
get
off
no
i
wo
said
ellen
throwing
both
arms
round
the
neck
of
her
pony
poor
brownie
you
sha
do
it
he
has
done
you
any
harm
nor
i
either
you
are
a
bad
man
get
off
repeated
saunders
i
will
not
said
ellen
still
clinging
fast
very
well
said
he
coolly
then
i
will
take
you
off
it
do
make
much
difference
we
go
along
a
little
further
till
i
find
a
nice
stone
for
you
to
sit
down
upon
if
you
had
got
off
then
i
would
done
much
to
him
but
i
give
it
to
him
now
if
he
has
been
used
to
a
whip
he
know
pretty
well
what
it
means
by
the
time
i
have
done
with
him
and
then
you
may
go
home
as
fast
as
you
can
it
is
very
likely
saunders
would
have
been
as
good
or
as
bad
as
his
word
his
behaviour
to
ellen
in
the
store
at
new
york
and
the
measures
taken
by
the
old
gentleman
who
had
befriended
her
had
been
the
cause
of
his
dismissal
from
the
employ
of
clair
and
fleury
two
or
three
other
attempts
to
get
into
business
had
come
to
nothing
and
he
had
been
obliged
to
return
to
his
native
town
ever
since
ellen
and
the
old
gentleman
had
lived
in
his
memory
as
objects
of
the
deepest
spite
the
one
for
interfering
the
other
for
having
been
the
innocent
cause
and
he
no
sooner
saw
her
in
the
than
he
promised
himself
revenge
such
revenge
as
only
the
meanest
and
most
cowardly
spirit
could
have
taken
pleasure
in
his
best
way
of
distressing
ellen
he
found
was
through
her
horse
he
had
almost
satisfied
himself
but
very
naturally
his
feelings
of
spite
had
grown
stronger
and
blunter
with
indulgence
and
he
meant
to
wind
up
with
such
a
treatment
of
her
pony
real
or
seeming
as
he
knew
would
give
great
pain
to
the
mistress
he
was
prevented
as
they
went
slowly
along
ellen
still
clasping
the
brownie
neck
and
resolved
to
cling
to
him
to
the
last
saunders
making
him
caper
in
a
way
very
uncomfortable
to
her
one
was
too
busy
and
the
other
too
deafened
by
fear
to
notice
the
sound
of
fast
approaching
hoofs
behind
them
it
happened
that
john
humphreys
had
passed
the
night
at
ventnor
and
having
an
errand
to
do
for
a
friend
at
thirlwall
had
taken
that
road
which
led
him
but
a
few
miles
out
of
his
way
and
was
now
at
full
speed
on
his
way
home
he
had
never
made
the
brownie
acquaintance
and
did
not
recognise
ellen
as
he
came
up
but
in
passing
them
some
strange
notion
crossing
his
mind
he
wheeled
his
horse
round
directly
in
front
of
the
astonished
pair
ellen
quitted
her
pony
neck
and
stretching
out
both
arms
towards
him
exclaimed
and
almost
shrieked
oh
john
john
send
him
away
make
him
let
me
go
what
are
you
about
sir
said
the
new
comer
sternly
it
none
of
your
business
answered
saunders
in
whom
rage
for
the
time
overcame
cowardice
take
your
hand
off
the
bridle
with
a
slight
touch
of
the
upon
the
hand
in
question
not
for
you
brother
said
saunders
sneeringly
i
walk
with
any
lady
i
a
mind
to
look
out
for
yourself
we
will
dispense
with
your
further
attendance
said
john
coolly
do
you
hear
me
do
as
i
order
you
the
speaker
did
not
put
himself
in
a
passion
and
saunders
accustomed
for
his
own
part
to
make
bluster
serve
instead
of
prowess
despised
a
command
so
calmly
given
ellen
who
knew
the
voice
and
still
better
could
read
the
eye
drew
conclusions
very
different
she
was
almost
breathless
with
terror
saunders
was
enraged
and
mortified
at
an
interference
that
promised
to
baffle
him
he
was
a
stout
young
man
and
judged
himself
the
stronger
of
the
two
and
took
notice
besides
that
the
stranger
had
nothing
in
his
hand
but
a
slight
he
answered
very
insolently
and
with
an
oath
and
john
saw
that
he
was
taking
the
bridle
in
his
left
hand
and
shifting
his
sapling
whip
so
as
to
bring
the
club
end
of
it
uppermost
the
next
instant
he
aimed
a
furious
blow
at
his
adversary
horse
the
quick
eye
and
hand
of
the
rider
disappointed
that
with
a
sudden
swerve
in
another
moment
and
ellen
hardly
saw
how
it
was
so
quick
john
had
dismounted
taken
saunders
by
the
collar
and
hurled
him
quite
over
into
the
gully
at
the
side
of
the
road
where
he
lay
at
full
length
without
stirring
ride
on
ellen
said
her
deliverer
she
obeyed
he
stayed
a
moment
to
say
to
his
fallen
adversary
a
few
words
of
pointed
warning
as
to
ever
repeating
his
offence
then
remounted
and
spurred
forward
to
join
ellen
all
her
power
of
keeping
up
was
gone
now
that
the
necessity
was
over
her
head
was
once
more
bowed
on
her
pony
neck
her
whole
frame
shaking
with
convulsive
sobs
she
could
scarce
with
great
effort
keep
from
crying
out
aloud
ellie
said
her
adopted
brother
in
a
voice
that
could
hardly
be
known
for
the
one
that
had
last
spoken
she
had
no
words
but
as
he
gently
took
one
of
her
hands
the
convulsive
squeeze
it
gave
him
showed
the
state
of
nervous
excitement
she
was
in
it
was
very
long
before
his
utmost
efforts
could
soothe
her
or
she
could
command
herself
enough
to
tell
him
her
story
when
at
last
told
it
was
with
many
tears
oh
how
could
he
how
could
he
said
poor
ellen
how
could
he
do
so
it
was
very
hard
an
involuntary
touch
of
the
spurs
made
john
horse
start
but
what
took
you
to
thirlwall
alone
said
he
you
have
not
told
me
that
yet
ellen
went
back
to
timothy
invasion
of
the
cabbages
and
gave
him
the
whole
history
of
the
morning
i
thought
when
i
was
going
for
the
doctor
at
first
said
she
and
then
afterwards
when
i
had
found
him
what
a
good
thing
it
was
that
timothy
broke
down
the
garden
fence
and
got
in
this
morning
for
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
i
should
not
have
gone
to
van
brunt
and
then
again
after
that
i
thought
if
he
only
had
little
things
often
draw
after
them
long
trains
of
circumstances
said
john
and
that
shows
the
folly
of
those
people
who
think
that
god
does
not
stoop
to
concern
himself
about
trifles
life
and
much
more
than
life
may
hang
upon
the
turn
of
a
hand
but
ellen
you
must
ride
no
more
alone
promise
me
that
you
will
not
i
will
not
to
thirlwall
certainly
said
ellen
but
may
i
to
alice
how
can
i
help
it
well
to
alice
that
is
a
safe
part
of
the
country
but
i
should
like
to
know
a
little
more
of
your
horse
before
trusting
you
even
there
of
the
brownie
said
ellen
oh
he
is
as
good
as
he
can
be
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
him
he
has
no
trick
at
all
there
never
was
such
a
good
little
horse
john
smiled
how
do
you
like
mine
said
he
is
that
your
new
one
oh
what
a
beauty
oh
me
what
a
beauty
i
did
look
at
him
before
oh
i
like
him
much
he
handsomer
than
the
brownie
do
you
like
him
very
well
this
is
the
first
trial
i
have
made
of
him
i
was
at
marshman
last
night
and
they
detained
me
this
morning
or
i
should
have
been
here
much
earlier
i
am
very
well
satisfied
with
him
so
far
and
if
you
had
been
detained
said
ellen
yes
ellie
i
should
not
have
fretted
at
my
late
breakfast
and
having
to
try
marshman
favourite
mare
if
i
had
known
what
good
purpose
the
delay
was
to
serve
i
wish
i
could
have
been
here
sooner
though
is
his
name
the
black
prince
said
ellen
returning
to
the
horse
yes
i
believe
so
but
you
shall
change
it
ellie
if
you
can
find
one
you
like
better
oh
i
can
not
i
like
that
very
much
how
beautiful
he
is
is
he
good
i
hope
so
said
john
smiling
if
he
is
not
i
shall
be
at
the
pains
to
make
him
so
we
are
hardly
acquainted
yet
ellen
looked
doubtfully
at
the
black
horse
and
his
rider
and
patting
the
brownie
neck
observed
with
great
satisfaction
that
was
very
good
john
had
been
riding
very
slowly
on
ellen
account
they
now
mended
their
pace
he
saw
however
that
she
still
looked
miserable
and
exerted
himself
to
turn
her
thoughts
from
everything
disagreeable
much
to
her
amusement
he
rode
round
her
two
or
three
times
to
view
her
horse
and
show
her
his
own
commended
the
brownie
praised
her
bridle
hand
corrected
several
things
about
her
riding
and
by
degrees
engaged
her
in
a
very
animated
conversation
ellen
roused
up
the
colour
came
back
to
her
cheeks
and
when
they
reached
home
and
rode
round
to
the
glass
door
she
looked
almost
like
herself
she
sprang
off
as
usual
without
waiting
for
any
help
john
scarce
saw
that
she
had
done
so
when
alice
cry
of
joy
brought
him
to
the
door
and
from
that
together
they
went
into
their
father
study
ellen
was
left
alone
on
the
lawn
something
was
the
matter
for
she
stood
with
swimming
eyes
and
a
trembling
lip
rubbing
her
stirrup
which
really
needed
no
polishing
and
forgetting
the
tired
horses
which
would
have
had
her
sympathy
at
any
other
time
what
the
matter
only
that
john
had
forgotten
the
kiss
he
always
gave
her
on
going
or
coming
ellen
was
jealous
of
it
as
a
pledge
of
sistership
and
could
not
want
it
and
though
she
tried
as
hard
as
she
could
to
get
her
face
in
order
so
that
she
might
go
in
and
meet
them
somehow
it
seemed
to
take
a
great
while
she
was
still
busy
with
her
stirrup
when
she
suddenly
felt
two
hands
on
her
shoulders
and
looking
up
received
the
very
kiss
the
want
of
which
she
had
been
lamenting
but
john
saw
the
tears
in
her
eyes
and
asked
her
she
thought
with
somewhat
of
a
comical
look
what
the
matter
was
ellen
was
ashamed
to
tell
but
he
had
her
there
by
the
shoulders
and
besides
whatever
that
eye
demanded
she
never
knew
how
to
keep
back
so
with
some
difficulty
she
told
him
you
are
a
foolish
child
ellie
said
he
gently
and
kissing
her
again
run
in
out
of
the
sun
while
i
see
to
the
horses
ellen
ran
in
and
told
her
long
story
to
alice
and
then
feeling
very
weary
and
weak
she
sat
on
the
sofa
and
lay
resting
in
her
arms
in
a
state
of
the
most
entire
and
unruffled
happiness
alice
however
after
a
while
transferred
her
to
bed
thinking
with
good
reason
that
a
long
sleep
would
be
the
best
thing
for
her
chapter
xxxix
now
is
the
pleasant
time
the
cool
the
silent
save
where
silence
yields
to
the
bird
that
now
awake
tunes
sweetest
her
song
now
reigns
full
orbed
the
moon
and
with
more
pleasing
light
shadowy
sets
off
the
face
of
things
milton
when
ellen
came
out
of
alice
room
again
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
the
sun
was
so
low
that
the
shadow
of
the
house
had
crossed
the
narrow
lawn
and
mounted
up
near
to
the
top
of
the
trees
but
on
them
he
was
still
shining
brightly
and
on
the
broad
landscape
beyond
which
lay
open
to
view
through
the
gap
in
the
trees
the
glass
door
was
open
the
sweet
summer
air
and
the
sound
of
birds
and
insects
and
fluttering
leaves
floated
into
the
room
making
the
stillness
musical
on
the
threshold
pussy
sat
crouched
with
his
fore
feet
doubled
under
his
breast
watching
with
intense
gravity
the
operations
of
margery
who
was
setting
the
table
on
the
lawn
just
before
his
eyes
alice
was
paring
peaches
oh
we
are
going
to
have
tea
out
of
doors
are
we
said
ellen
very
glad
what
a
lovely
evening
is
it
just

john

he

i

the
table
and
here
a
pitcher
of
splendid
cream
alice
you
had
better
not
tell
john
so
or
he
will
make
you
define
john
came
back
in
good
time
and
brought
word
that
van
brunt
was
doing
very
well
so
far
as
could
be
known
also
that
miss
fortune
consented
to
ellen
remaining
where
she
was
he
wisely
did
not
say
however
that
her
consent
had
been
slow
to
gain
till
he
had
hinted
at
his
readiness
to
provide
a
substitute
for
ellen
services
on
which
miss
fortune
had
instantly
declared
that
she
did
not
want
her
and
she
might
stay
as
long
as
she
pleased
this
was
all
that
was
needed
to
complete
ellen
felicity
was
your
poor
horse
too
tired
to
go
out
again
this
afternoon
mr
john
i
did
not
ride
him
ellie
i
took
yours
the
brownie
did
you
i
very
glad
how
did
you
like
him
but
perhaps
was
tired
a
little
and
you
could
tell
so
well
he
was
not
tired
with
any
work
you
had
given
him
ellie
perhaps
he
may
be
a
little
now
why
said
ellen
somewhat
alarmed
i
have
been
trying
him
and
instead
of
going
quietly
along
the
road
we
have
been
taking
some
of
the
fences
in
our
way
as
i
intend
practising
you
at
the
bar
i
wished
to
make
sure
in
the
first
place
that
he
knew
his
lesson
well
how
did
he
do
perfectly
well
i
believe
he
is
a
good
little
fellow
i
wanted
to
satisfy
myself
if
he
was
fit
to
be
trusted
with
you
and
i
rather
think
marshman
has
taken
care
of
that
the
whole
wall
of
trees
was
in
shadow
when
the
little
family
sat
down
to
table
but
there
was
still
the
sunlit
picture
behind
and
there
was
another
kind
of
sunshine
in
every
face
at
the
table
quietly
happy
the
whole
four
or
at
least
the
whole
three
were
first
in
being
together
after
that
in
all
things
besides
never
was
tea
so
refreshing
or
bread
and
butter
so
sweet
or
the
song
of
birds
so
delightsome
when
the
birds
had
gone
to
their
nests
the
cricket
and
grasshopper
and
tree
toad
and
and
nameless
other
songsters
kept
up
a
concert
nature
own
in
delicious
harmony
with
woods
and
flowers
and
summer
breezes
and
evening
light
ellen
cup
of
enjoyment
was
running
over
from
one
beautiful
thing
to
another
her
eye
wandered
from
one
joy
to
another
her
thoughts
went
till
her
heart
full
fixed
on
the
god
who
had
made
and
given
them
all
and
that
redeemer
whose
blood
had
been
their
purchase
money
from
the
dear
friends
beside
her
the
she
had
in
the
world
she
thought
of
the
one
dearer
yet
from
whom
death
had
separated
her
yet
living
still
and
to
whom
death
would
restore
her
thanks
to
him
who
had
burst
the
bonds
of
death
and
broken
the
gates
of
the
grave
and
made
a
way
for
his
ransomed
to
pass
over
and
the
thought
of
him
was
the
joyfullest
of
all
you
look
happy
ellie
said
her
adopted
brother
so
i
am
said
ellen
smiling
a
very
bright
smile
what
are
you
thinking
about
but
john
saw
it
would
not
do
to
press
his
question
you
remind
me
said
he
of
some
old
fairy
story
that
my
childish
ears
received
in
which
the
fountains
of
the
sweet
and
bitter
waters
of
life
were
said
to
stand
very
near
each
other
and
to
mingle
their
streams
but
a
little
way
from
their
source
your
tears
and
smiles
seem
to
be
brothers
and
sisters
whenever
we
see
one
we
may
be
sure
the
other
is
not
far
off
my
dear
jack
said
alice
laughing
what
an
unhappy
simile
are
brothers
and
sisters
always
found
like
that
i
wish
they
were
said
john
sighing
and
smiling
but
my
last
words
had
nothing
to
do
with
my
simile
as
you
call
it
when
tea
was
over
and
margery
had
withdrawn
the
things
and
taken
away
the
table
they
still
lingered
in
their
places
it
was
far
too
pleasant
to
go
in
humphreys
moved
his
chair
to
the
side
of
the
house
and
throwing
a
handkerchief
over
his
head
to
defend
him
from
the
mosquitoes
a
few
of
which
were
buzzing
about
he
either
listened
meditated
or
slept
most
probably
one
of
the
two
latter
for
the
conversation
was
not
very
loud
nor
very
lively
it
was
happiness
enough
merely
to
breathe
so
near
each
other
the
sun
left
the
distant
fields
and
hills
soft
twilight
stole
through
the
woods
down
the
gap
and
over
the
plain
the
grass
lost
its
green
the
wall
of
trees
grew
dark
and
dusky
and
very
faint
and
dim
showed
the
picture
that
was
so
bright
a
little
while
ago
as
they
sat
quite
silent
listening
to
what
nature
had
to
say
to
them
or
letting
fancy
and
memory
take
their
way
the
silence
was
broken
hardly
broken
by
the
distinct
cry
of
a
alice
grasped
her
brother
arm
and
they
remained
motionless
while
it
came
nearer
nearer
then
quite
near
with
its
clear
wild
shrill
melancholy
note
sounding
close
by
them
again
and
again
strangely
plaintively
then
leaving
the
lawn
it
was
heard
further
and
further
off
till
the
last
faint
in
the
far
distance
ended
its
pretty
interlude
it
was
almost
too
dark
to
read
faces
but
the
eyes
of
the
brother
and
sister
had
sought
each
other
and
remained
fixed
till
the
bird
was
out
of
hearing
then
alice
hand
was
removed
to
his
and
her
head
found
its
old
place
on
her
brother
shoulder
sometimes
john
said
alice
i
am
afraid
i
have
one
tie
too
strong
to
this
world
i
can
not
bear
as
i
ought
to
have
you
away
from
me
her
brother
lips
were
instantly
pressed
to
her
forehead
i
may
say
to
you
alice
as
colonel
gardiner
said
to
his
wife
have
an
eternity
to
spend
together
i
wonder
said
alice
after
a
pause
how
those
can
bear
to
love
and
be
loved
whose
affection
can
see
nothing
but
a
blank
beyond
the
grave
few
people
i
believe
said
her
brother
would
come
exactly
under
that
description
most
flatter
themselves
with
a
vague
hope
of
reunion
after
death
but
that
is
a
miserable
hope
very
different
from
ours
very
different
indeed
and
miserable
for
it
can
only
deceive
but
ours
is
sure
that
sleep
in
jesus
will
god
bring
with
him
precious
said
alice
how
exactly
fitted
to
every
want
and
mood
of
the
mind
are
the
sweet
bible
words
well
said
humphreys
rousing
himself
i
am
going
in
these
mosquitoes
have
half
eaten
me
up
are
you
going
to
sit
there
all
night
we
are
thinking
of
it
papa
said
alice
cheerfully
he
went
in
and
was
heard
calling
margery
for
a
light
they
had
better
lights
on
the
lawn
the
stars
began
to
peep
out
through
the
soft
blue
and
as
the
blue
grew
deeper
they
came
out
more
and
brighter
till
all
heaven
was
hung
with
lamps
but
that
was
not
all
in
the
eastern
horizon
just
above
the
low
hills
that
bordered
the
far
side
of
the
plain
a
white
light
spreading
and
growing
and
brightening
promised
the
moon
and
promised
that
she
would
rise
very
splendid
and
even
before
she
came
began
to
throw
a
faint
lustre
over
the
landscape
all
eyes
were
fastened
and
exclamations
burst
as
the
first
silver
edge
showed
itself
and
the
moon
rapidly
rising
looked
on
them
with
her
whole
broad
bright
face
lighting
up
not
only
their
faces
and
figures
but
the
wide
country
view
that
was
spread
out
below
and
touching
most
beautifully
the
trees
in
the
edge
of
the
gap
and
faintly
the
lawn
while
the
wall
of
wood
stood
in
deeper
and
blacker
shadow
than
ever
is
that
beautiful
said
ellen
come
round
here
ellie
said
john
alice
may
have
you
all
the
rest
of
the
year
but
when
i
am
at
home
you
belong
to
me
what
was
your
little
head
busied
upon
a
while
ago
when
said
ellen
when
i
asked
you
oh
i
know
i
remember
i
was
thinking
well
i
was
thinking
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
unless
you
would
rather
not
i
was
thinking
about
jesus
christ
said
ellen
in
a
low
tone
what
about
him
dear
ellie
said
her
brother
drawing
her
closer
to
his
side
different
things
i
was
thinking
of
what
he
said
about
little
children
and
about
what
he
said
you
know
my
father
house
are
many
mansions
and
i
was
thinking
that
mamma
was
there
and
i
thought
that
we
all
ellen
could
get
no
further
that
believeth
in
him
shall
not
be
ashamed
said
john
softly
is
the
promise
that
he
hath
promised
us
even
eternal
life
and
who
shall
separate
us
from
the
love
of
christ
not
death
nor
things
present
nor
things
to
come
but
he
that
hath
this
hope
in
him
purifieth
himself
even
as
he
is
pure
let
us
remember
that
too
john
said
ellen
presently
do
you
like
some
of
the
chapters
in
the
revelation
very
much
yes
very
much
why
do
you
yes
i
remember
reading
parts
of
them
to
mamma
and
that
is
one
reason
i
suppose
but
i
like
them
very
much
there
is
a
great
deal
i
understand
though
there
is
nothing
finer
in
the
bible
than
parts
of
that
book
said
alice
john
said
ellen
what
is
meant
by
the
stone
and
in
the
stone
a
new
name
written
yes
that
i
mean
baxter
says
it
is
the
sense
of
god
love
in
the
heart
and
indeed
that
is
it
no
man
knoweth
saving
him
that
receiveth
it
this
i
take
it
ellen
was
christian
certificate
which
he
used
to
comfort
himself
with
reading
in
you
remember
can
a
child
have
it
said
ellen
thoughtfully
certainly
many
children
have
had
it
you
may
have
it
only
seek
it
faithfully
meetest
him
that
rejoiceth
and
worketh
righteousness
those
that
remember
thee
in
thy
ways
and
christ
said
that
loveth
me
shall
be
loved
of
my
father
and
i
will
love
him
and
i
will
manifest
myself
to
him
there
is
no
failure
in
these
promises
ellie
he
that
made
them
is
the
same
yesterday
and
for
ever
for
a
little
while
each
was
busy
with
his
own
meditations
the
moon
meanwhile
rising
higher
and
higher
poured
a
flood
of
light
through
the
gap
in
the
woods
before
them
and
stealing
among
the
trees
here
and
there
lit
up
a
spot
of
ground
under
their
deep
shadow
the
distant
picture
lay
in
mazy
brightness
all
was
still
but
the
ceaseless
chirrup
of
insects
and
gentle
flapping
of
leaves
the
summer
air
just
touched
their
cheeks
with
the
lightest
breath
of
a
kiss
sweet
from
distant
and
nearer
pines
and
hemlocks
and
other
of
numberless
the
had
been
remarkably
late
this
year
this
is
higher
enjoyment
said
john
than
half
those
who
make
their
homes
in
rich
houses
and
mighty
palaces
have
any
notion
of
but
can
not
rich
people
look
at
the
moon
said
ellen
yes
but
the
taste
for
pure
pleasure
is
commonly
gone
when
people
make
a
trade
of
pleasure
john
ellen
began
i
will
forewarn
you
said
he
that
john
has
made
up
his
mind
he
will
do
nothing
more
for
you
so
if
you
have
anything
to
ask
it
must
lie
still
unless
you
will
begin
again
ellen
drew
back
he
looked
grave
but
she
saw
alice
smiling
but
what
shall
i
do
said
she
a
little
perplexed
and
half
laughing
what
do
you
mean
john
what
does
he
mean
alice
you
could
speak
without
a
to
me
this
morning
when
you
were
in
trouble
oh
said
ellen
laughing
i
forgot
myself
then
have
the
goodness
to
forget
yourself
permanently
for
the
future
was
that
man
hurt
this
morning
john
said
his
sister
what
man
that
man
you
delivered
ellen
from
hurt
no
nothing
material
i
did
not
wish
to
hurt
him
he
richly
deserved
punishment
but
it
was
not
for
me
to
give
it
he
was
in
no
hurry
to
get
up
said
ellen
i
do
not
think
he
ventured
upon
that
till
we
were
well
out
of
the
way
he
lifted
his
head
and
looked
after
us
as
we
rode
off
but
i
wanted
to
ask
something
said
ellen
oh
what
is
the
reason
the
moon
looks
so
much
larger
when
she
first
gets
up
than
she
does
afterwards
whom
are
you
asking
you
and
who
is
here
are
two
people
in
the
moonlight
john
humphreys
alice
brother
and
that
thomas
calls
young
master
said
ellen
laughing
you
are
more
shy
of
taking
a
leap
than
your
little
horse
is
said
john
smiling
but
i
shall
bring
you
up
to
it
yet
what
is
the
cause
of
the
sudden
enlargement
of
my
thumb
he
had
drawn
a
small
magnifying
glass
from
his
pocket
and
held
it
between
his
hand
and
ellen
why
it
is
not
enlarged
said
ellen
it
is
only
magnified
what
do
you
mean
by
that
why
the
glass
makes
it
look
larger
do
you
know
how
or
why
no
he
put
up
the
glass
again
but
what
do
you
mean
by
that
said
ellen
there
is
no
magnifying
glass
between
us
and
the
moon
to
make
look
larger
you
are
sure
of
that
why
yes
said
ellen
i
am
perfectly
sure
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
there
she
is
right
up
there
looking
straight
down
upon
us
and
there
is
nothing
between
what
is
it
that
keeps
up
that
pleasant
fluttering
of
leaves
in
the
wood
why
the
wind
and
what
is
the
wind
it
is
air
air
moving
i
suppose
exactly
then
there
something
between
us
and
the
moon
the
air
but
john
one
can
see
quite
clearly
through
the
air
it
does
make
things
look
larger
or
smaller
how
far
do
you
suppose
the
air
reaches
from
us
towards
the
moon
why
all
the
way
do
it
no
only
about
forty
miles
if
it
reached
all
the
way
there
would
indeed
be
no
magnifying
glass
in
the
case
but
how
is
it
said
ellen
i
do
understand
i
can
not
tell
you
ellie
there
is
a
long
ladder
of
knowledge
to
go
up
before
we
can
get
to
the
moon
but
we
will
begin
to
mount
if
nothing
happens
alice
you
have
that
little
book
of
conversations
on
natural
philosophy
which
you
and
i
used
to
delight
ourselves
with
in
old
time
safe
and
sound
in
the
bookcase
said
alice
i
have
thought
of
giving
it
to
ellen
before
but
she
has
been
busy
enough
with
what
she
had
already
i
have
done
rollin
now
though
said
ellen
that
is
lucky
i
am
ready
for
the
moon
this
new
study
was
begun
the
next
day
and
ellen
took
great
delight
in
it
she
would
have
run
on
too
fast
in
her
eagerness
but
for
the
steady
hand
of
her
teacher
he
obliged
her
to
be
very
thorough
this
was
only
one
of
her
items
of
business
the
weeks
of
john
stay
were
as
usual
not
merely
weeks
of
constant
and
varied
delight
but
of
constant
and
swift
improvement
too
a
good
deal
of
time
was
given
to
the
john
busied
himself
one
morning
in
preparing
a
bar
for
her
on
the
lawn
so
placed
that
it
might
fall
if
the
horse
heels
touched
it
here
ellen
learned
to
take
first
standing
and
then
running
leaps
she
was
afraid
at
first
but
habit
wore
that
off
and
the
bar
was
raised
higher
and
higher
till
margery
declared
she
could
stand
and
look
at
her
going
over
it
then
john
made
her
ride
without
the
stirrup
and
with
her
hands
behind
her
while
he
holding
the
horse
by
a
long
halter
made
him
go
round
in
a
circle
slowly
at
first
and
afterwards
trotting
and
cantering
till
ellen
felt
almost
as
secure
on
his
back
as
in
a
chair
it
took
a
good
many
lessons
however
to
bring
her
to
this
and
she
trembled
very
much
at
the
beginning
her
teacher
was
careful
and
gentle
but
determined
and
whatever
he
said
she
did
tremble
or
no
tremble
and
in
general
loved
her
riding
lessons
dearly
drawing
too
went
on
finely
he
began
to
let
her
draw
things
from
nature
and
many
a
pleasant
morning
the
three
went
out
together
with
pencils
and
books
and
work
and
spent
hours
in
the
open
air
they
would
find
a
pretty
point
of
view
or
a
nice
shady
place
where
the
breeze
came
and
where
there
was
some
good
old
rock
with
a
tree
beside
it
or
a
piece
of
fence
or
the
house
or
barn
in
the
distance
for
ellen
to
sketch
and
while
she
drew
and
alice
worked
john
read
aloud
to
them
sometimes
he
took
a
pencil
too
and
alice
read
and
often
often
pencils
books
and
work
were
all
laid
down
and
talk
lively
serious
earnest
always
delightful
took
the
place
of
them
when
ellen
could
not
understand
the
words
at
least
she
could
read
the
faces
and
that
was
a
study
she
was
never
weary
of
at
home
there
were
other
studies
and
much
reading
many
on
the
lawn
and
even
breakfastings
which
she
thought
pleasanter
still
as
soon
as
it
was
decided
that
van
brunt
leg
was
doing
well
and
in
a
fair
way
to
be
sound
again
ellen
went
to
see
him
and
after
that
rarely
let
two
days
pass
without
going
again
john
and
alice
used
to
ride
with
her
so
far
and
taking
a
turn
beyond
while
she
made
her
visit
call
for
her
on
their
way
back
she
had
a
strong
motive
for
going
in
the
pleasure
her
presence
always
gave
both
to
van
brunt
and
his
mother
sam
larkens
had
been
to
thirlwall
and
seen
forbes
and
from
him
they
had
heard
the
story
of
her
riding
up
and
down
the
town
in
search
of
the
doctor
neither
of
them
could
forget
it
van
brunt
poured
out
her
affection
in
all
sorts
of
expressions
whenever
she
had
ellen
ear
her
son
was
not
a
man
of
many
words
but
ellen
knew
his
face
and
manner
well
enough
without
them
and
read
there
whenever
she
went
into
his
room
what
gave
her
great
pleasure
how
do
you
do
van
brunt
she
said
on
one
of
these
occasions
oh
i
getting
along
i
said
he
getting
along
as
well
as
a
man
can
that
lying
on
his
back
from
morning
to
night
prostrated
as
dennison
said
his
corn
was
day
it
is
very
tiresome
is
it
said
ellen
it
the
tiresomest
work
that
ever
was
for
a
man
that
has
two
arms
to
be
adoing
nothing
day
after
day
and
what
bothers
me
is
the
wheat
in
that
lot
that
to
be
prostrated
too
and
ai
nor
ai
like
to
be
as
i
know
unless
the
rain
comes
and
does
it
sam
and
johnny
make
no
headway
at
all
with
it
i
can
tell
as
well
as
if
i
see
but
sam
is
good
is
he
said
ellen
sam
as
good
a
boy
as
ever
was
but
then
johnny
low
is
mischievous
you
see
and
he
gets
sam
out
of
his
tracks
once
in
a
while
i
never
see
a
finer
growth
of
wheat
i
had
a
sight
rather
cut
and
harvest
the
hull
of
it
than
to
lie
here
and
think
of
it
getting
spoiled
i
out
o
conceit
o
ellen
ellen
could
not
help
smiling
what
can
i
do
for
you
van
brunt
there
ai
nothing
said
he
i
wish
there
was
how
are
you
coming
along
at
home
i
do
know
said
ellen
i
am
not
there
just
now
you
know
i
am
staying
up
with
miss
alice
again
oh
ay
while
her
brother
at
home
he
a
splendid
man
that
young
humphreys
ai
he
oh
knew
that
a
great
while
ago
said
ellen
the
bright
colour
of
pleasure
overspreading
her
face
well
did
you
see
till
the
other
day
when
he
came
here
very
kindly
to
see
how
i
was
getting
on
i
wish
something
would
bring
him
again
i
never
heerd
a
man
talk
i
liked
to
hear
so
much
ellen
secretly
resolved
something
bring
him
and
went
on
with
a
purpose
she
had
had
for
some
time
in
her
mind
would
it
be
pleasant
while
you
are
lying
there
and
can
do
nothing
would
you
like
to
have
me
read
something
to
you
van
brunt
should
like
to
very
much
it
just
like
you
said
he
gratefully
to
think
of
that
but
i
would
have
you
be
bothered
with
it
it
would
indeed
i
should
like
it
very
much
well
if
you
a
mind
said
he
i
ca
say
but
it
would
be
a
kind
o
comfort
to
keep
that
grain
out
o
my
head
a
while
seems
to
me
i
have
cut
and
housed
it
all
three
times
over
already
read
just
whatever
you
have
a
mind
to
if
you
was
to
go
over
a
last
year
almanac
it
would
be
as
good
as
a
fiddle
to
me
i
do
better
for
you
than
that
van
brunt
said
ellen
laughing
in
high
glee
at
having
gained
her
point
she
had
secretly
brought
her
pilgrim
progress
with
her
and
now
with
marvellous
satisfaction
drew
it
forth
i
been
as
much
of
a
reader
as
i
had
ought
to
said
van
brunt
as
she
opened
the
book
and
turned
to
the
first
page
but
however
i
understand
my
business
pretty
well
and
a
man
ca
be
everything
to
once
now
let
hear
what
you
got
there
with
a
throbbing
heart
ellen
began
and
read
notes
and
all
till
the
sound
of
trampling
hoofs
and
alice
voice
made
her
break
off
it
encouraged
and
delighted
her
to
see
that
van
brunt
attention
was
perfectly
fixed
he
lay
still
without
moving
his
eyes
from
her
face
till
she
stopped
then
thanking
her
he
declared
that
was
a
book
and
he
should
like
mainly
to
hear
the
hull
on
it
from
that
time
ellen
was
diligent
in
her
attendance
on
him
that
she
might
have
more
time
for
reading
than
the
old
plan
gave
her
she
set
off
by
herself
alone
some
time
before
the
others
of
course
riding
home
with
them
it
cost
her
a
little
sometimes
to
forego
so
much
of
their
company
but
she
never
saw
the
look
of
grateful
pleasure
with
which
she
was
welcomed
without
ceasing
to
regret
her
how
ellen
blessed
those
notes
as
she
went
on
with
her
reading
they
said
exactly
what
she
wanted
van
brunt
to
hear
and
in
the
best
way
and
were
too
short
and
simple
to
interrupt
the
interest
of
the
story
after
a
while
she
ventured
to
ask
if
she
might
read
him
a
chapter
in
the
bible
he
agreed
very
readily
owning
he
had
ought
to
be
so
long
without
reading
one
as
he
had
been
ellen
then
made
it
a
rule
to
herself
without
asking
any
more
questions
to
end
every
reading
with
a
chapter
in
the
bible
and
she
carefully
sought
out
those
that
might
be
most
likely
to
take
hold
of
his
judgment
or
feelings
they
took
hold
of
her
own
very
deeply
by
the
means
what
was
strong
or
tender
before
now
seemed
to
her
too
mighty
to
be
withstood
and
ellen
read
not
only
with
her
lips
but
with
her
whole
heart
the
precious
words
longing
that
they
might
come
with
their
just
effect
upon
van
brunt
mind
once
as
she
finished
reading
the
tenth
chapter
of
john
a
favourite
chapter
which
between
her
own
feeling
of
it
and
her
strong
wish
for
him
had
moved
her
even
to
tears
she
cast
a
glance
at
his
face
to
see
how
he
took
it
his
head
was
a
little
turned
to
one
side
and
his
eyes
closed
she
thought
he
was
asleep
ellen
was
very
much
disappointed
she
sank
her
head
upon
her
book
and
prayed
that
a
time
might
come
when
he
would
know
the
worth
of
those
words
the
touch
of
his
hand
startled
her
what
is
the
matter
said
he
are
you
tired
no
said
ellen
looking
hastily
up
oh
no
i
not
tired
but
what
ails
you
said
the
astonished
van
brunt
what
have
you
been
a
crying
for
what
the
matter
oh
never
mind
said
ellen
brushing
her
hand
over
her
eyes
it
no
matter
yes
but
i
want
to
know
said
van
brunt
you
sha
have
anything
to
vex
you
that
can
help
what
is
it
it
is
nothing
van
brunt
said
ellen
bursting
into
tears
again
only
i
thought
you
were
asleep
i
i
thought
you
did
care
enough
about
the
bible
to
keep
awake
i
want
so
much
that
you
should
be
a
christian
he
half
groaned
and
turned
his
head
away
what
makes
you
wish
that
so
much
said
he
after
a
minute
or
two
because
i
want
you
to
be
happy
said
ellen
and
i
know
you
without
well
i
am
pretty
tolerable
happy
said
he
as
happy
as
most
folks
i
guess
but
i
want
you
to
be
happy
when
you
die
too
said
ellen
i
want
to
meet
you
in
heaven
i
hope
i
will
go
there
surely
said
he
gravely
when
the
time
comes
ellen
was
uneasily
silent
not
knowing
what
to
say
i
ai
as
good
as
i
ought
to
be
said
he
presently
with
a
half
sigh
i
ai
good
enough
to
go
to
heaven
i
wish
i
was
are
i
believe
i
oh
no
van
brunt
do
not
say
that
i
am
not
good
at
all
i
am
full
of
wrong
things
well
i
wish
i
was
full
of
wrong
things
too
in
the
same
way
said
he
but
i
am
said
ellen
whether
you
will
believe
it
or
not
nobody
is
good
van
brunt
but
jesus
christ
has
died
for
us
and
if
we
ask
him
he
will
forgive
us
and
wash
away
our
sins
and
teach
us
to
love
him
and
make
us
good
and
take
us
to
be
with
him
in
heaven
oh
i
wish
you
would
ask
him
she
repeated
with
an
earnestness
that
went
to
his
heart
i
do
believe
any
one
can
be
very
happy
that
does
love
him
is
that
what
makes
happy
said
he
i
have
a
great
many
things
to
make
me
happy
said
ellen
soberly
but
that
is
the
greatest
of
all
it
always
makes
me
happy
to
think
of
him
and
it
makes
everything
else
a
thousand
times
pleasanter
i
wish
you
knew
how
it
is
van
brunt
he
was
silent
for
a
little
and
disturbed
ellen
thought
well
said
he
at
length
the
folks
that
thinks
themselves
the
best
that
the
best
always
if
you
ai
good
i
should
like
to
know
what
goodness
is
somebody
that
thinks
you
be
said
he
a
minute
or
two
afterwards
as
the
horses
were
heard
coming
to
the
gate
no
she
knows
me
better
than
that
said
ellen
it
is
any
that
i
mean
said
van
brunt
there
somebody
else
out
there
ai
there
who
said
ellen
john
oh
no
indeed
he
do
it
was
only
this
morning
he
was
telling
me
of
something
i
did
that
was
wrong
her
eyes
watered
as
she
spoke
he
must
have
mighty
sharp
eyes
then
said
van
brunt
for
it
beats
all
powers
of
seeing
things
and
so
he
has
said
ellen
putting
on
her
bonnet
he
always
knows
what
i
am
thinking
of
just
as
well
as
if
i
told
him
said
he
i
forgotten
what
you
been
saying
and
i
do
mean
to
how
full
of
sweet
pleasure
was
the
ride
home
the
something
wrong
of
which
ellen
had
spoken
was
this
the
day
before
it
happened
that
john
had
broken
her
off
from
a
very
engaging
book
to
take
her
and
as
he
stooped
down
to
give
a
touch
or
two
to
the
piece
she
was
to
copy
he
said
i
do
want
you
to
read
any
more
of
that
ellie
it
is
not
a
good
book
for
you
ellen
did
not
for
a
moment
question
that
he
was
right
nor
wish
to
disobey
but
she
had
become
very
much
interested
and
was
a
good
deal
annoyed
at
having
such
a
sudden
stop
put
to
her
pleasure
she
said
nothing
and
went
on
with
her
work
in
a
little
while
alice
asked
her
to
hold
a
skein
of
cotton
for
her
while
she
wound
it
ellen
was
annoyed
again
at
the
interruption
the
were
jarring
yet
and
gave
fresh
discord
to
every
touch
she
had
however
no
mind
to
let
her
vexation
be
seen
she
went
immediately
and
held
the
cotton
and
as
soon
as
it
was
done
sat
down
again
to
her
drawing
before
ten
minutes
had
passed
margery
came
to
set
the
table
for
dinner
ellen
papers
and
desk
must
move
why
it
is
not
yet
this
great
while
margery
said
she
it
is
much
after
twelve
no
miss
ellen
said
margery
under
her
breath
for
john
was
in
one
corner
of
the
room
reading
but
i
be
busy
with
the
chops
and
frying
the
salsify
and
i
could
leave
the
kitchen
if
you
let
me
have
the
table
now
ellen
said
no
more
and
moved
her
things
to
a
stand
before
the
window
where
she
went
on
with
her
copying
till
dinner
was
ready
whatever
the
reason
was
however
her
pencil
did
not
work
smoothly
her
eye
did
not
see
true
and
she
lacked
her
usual
steady
patience
the
next
morning
after
an
hour
and
more
work
and
much
painstaking
the
drawing
was
finished
ellen
had
quite
forgotten
her
yesterday
trouble
but
when
john
came
to
review
her
drawing
he
found
several
faults
with
it
pointed
out
two
or
three
places
in
which
it
had
suffered
from
haste
and
want
of
care
and
asked
her
how
it
had
happened
ellen
knew
it
happened
yesterday
she
was
vexed
again
though
she
did
her
best
not
to
show
it
she
stood
quietly
and
heard
what
he
had
to
say
he
then
told
her
to
get
ready
for
her
riding
lesson
may
i
just
make
this
right
first
said
ellen
it
wo
take
me
long
no
said
he
you
have
been
sitting
long
enough
i
must
break
you
off
the
brownie
will
be
here
in
ten
minutes
ellen
was
impatiently
eager
to
mend
the
bad
places
in
her
drawing
and
impatiently
displeased
at
being
obliged
to
ride
first
slowly
and
reluctantly
she
went
to
get
ready
john
was
already
gone
she
would
not
have
moved
so
leisurely
if
he
had
been
anywhere
within
seeing
distance
as
it
was
she
found
it
convenient
to
quicken
her
movements
and
was
at
the
door
ready
as
soon
as
he
and
the
brownie
she
was
soon
thoroughly
engaged
in
the
management
of
herself
and
her
horse
a
little
smart
riding
shook
all
the
ill
humour
out
of
her
and
she
was
entirely
herself
again
at
the
end
of
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
they
drew
up
under
the
shade
of
a

a

it
was
a
warm
day
and
john
had
taken
off
his
hat
and
stood
resting
too
with
his
arm
leaning
on
the
neck
of
the
horse
presently
he
looked
round
to
ellen
and
asked
her
with
a
smile
if
she
felt
right
again
why
said
ellen
the
crimson
of
her
cheeks
mounting
to
her
forehead
but
her
eye
sank
immediately
at
the
answering
glance
of
his
he
then
in
very
few
words
set
the
matter
before
her
with
such
a
happy
mixture
of
pointedness
and
kindness
that
while
the
reproof
coming
from
him
went
to
the
quick
ellen
yet
joined
with
it
no
thought
of
harshness
or
severity
she
was
completely
subdued
however
the
rest
of
the
lesson
had
to
be
given
up
and
for
an
hour
ellen
tears
could
not
be
stayed
but
it
was
and
john
had
meant
it
should
be
a
strong
check
given
to
her
besetting
sin
it
had
a
long
and
lasting
effect

sam

declared
she
was
thankful
she
could
draw
a
long
breath
again
for
do
what
she
would
she
could
be
everywhere
before
this
john
and
the

had
departed
and
alice
and
ellen
were
left
alone
again
how
long
will
it
be
dear
alice
said
ellen
as
they
stood
sorrowfully
looking
down
the
road
by
which
he
had
gone
before
he
will
be
through
that
before
he
will
be
able
to
leave
doncaster
next
summer
and
what
will
he
do
then
then
he
will
be
ordained
ordained

is
that
he
will
be
solemnly
set
apart
for
the
work
of
the
ministry
and
appointed
to
it
by
a
number
of
clergymen
and
then
will
he
come
and
stay
at
home
alice
i
do
know
what
then
dear
ellen
said
alice
sighing
he
may
for
a
little
but
papa
wishes
very
much
that
before
he
is
settled
anywhere
he
should
visit
england
and
scotland
and
see
our
friends
there
though
i
hardly
think
john
will
do
it
unless
he
sees
some
further
reason
for
going
if
he
do
not
he
will
probably
soon
be
called
somewhere
marshman
wants
him
to
come
to
randolph
i
do
know
how
it
will
be
well
said
ellen
with
a
kind
of
acquiescing
sigh
at
any
rate
now
we
must
wait
until
next
christmas
the
winter
passed
away
with
little
to
mark
it
except
the
usual
visits
to
ventnor
which
however
by
common
consent
alice
and
ellen
had
agreed
should
be
when
john
was
at
home
at
all
other
times
they
were
much
prized
and
enjoyed
every
two
or
three
months
marshman
was
sure
to
come
for
them
or
howard
or
perhaps
the
carriage
only
with
a
letter
and
it
was
bargained
that
humphreys
should
follow
to
see
them
home
it
was
not
always
that
ellen
could
go
but
the
disappointments
were
seldom
she
too
had
become
quite
domesticated
at
ventnor
and
was
sincerely
loved
by
the
whole
family
many
as
were
the
times
she
had
been
there
it
had
oddly
happened
that
she
had
never
met
her
old
friend
of
the
boat
again
but
she
was
very
much
attached
to
old
and
marshman
and
chauncey
and
her
daughter
the
latter
of
whom
reckoned
all
the
rest
of
her
young
friends
as
nothing
compared
with
ellen
montgomery
ellen
in
her
opinion
did
everything
better
than
any
one
else
of
her
age
she
has
good
teachers
said
chauncey
yes
indeed
i
should
think
she
had
alice
i
should
think
anybody
would
learn
well
with
her
and
john
i
suppose
he
as
good
though
i
do
know
so
much
about
him
but
he
must
be
a
great
deal
better
teacher
than
sandford
mamma
for
ellen
draws
as
well
as
i
do
perhaps
that
is
your
fault
and
not
sandford
said
her
mother
though
i
rather
think
you
overrate
the
difference
i
am
sure
i
take
pains
enough
if
that
all
said
the
little
girl
what
more
can
i
do
mamma
but
ellen
is
so
pleasant
about
it
always
she
never
seems
to
think
she
does
better
than
i
and
she
is
always
ready
to
help
me
and
take
ever
so
much
time
to
show
me
how
to
do
things
she
is
pleasant
is
she
mamma
i
know
i
have
heard
you
say
she
is
very
polite
she
is
certainly
that
said
gillespie
and
there
is
a
grace
in
her
politeness
that
can
only
proceed
from
great
natural
delicacy
and
refinement
of
character
how
she
can
have
such
manners
living
and
working
in
the
way
you
say
she
does
i
confess
is
beyond
my
comprehension
one
would
not
readily
forget
the
notion
of
in
the
society
of
alice
and
john
humphreys
said
miss
sophia
and
humphreys
said
chauncey
there
is
no
society
about
him
said
miss
sophia
he
do
say
two
dozen
words
a
day
but
she
is
not
with
them
said
gillespie
she
is
with
them
a
great
deal
aunt
matilda
said
ellen
chauncey
and
they
teach
her
everything
and
she
does
learn
she
must
be
very
clever
do
you
think
she
is
mamma
mamma
she
beats
me
entirely
in
speaking
french
and
she
knows
all
about
english
history
and
arithmetic
and
did
you
ever
hear
her
sing
mamma
i
do
not
believe
she
beats
you
as
you
call
it
in
generous
estimation
of
others
said
chauncey
smiling
and
bending
forward
to
kiss
her
daughter
but
what
is
the
reason
ellen
is
so
much
better
read
in
history
than
you
i
do
know
mamma
unless
i
wish
i
was
so
fond
of
reading
stories
ellen
montgomery
is
just
as
fond
of
them
i
warrant
said
miss
sophia
yes
oh
i
know
she
is
fond
of
them
but
then
alice
and
john
let
her
read
them
except
now
and
then
one
i
fancy
she
does
it
though
when
their
backs
are
turned
said
gillespie
she
oh
aunt
matilda
she
would
do
the
least
thing
they
do
like
for
the
whole
world
i
know
she
never
reads
a
story
when
she
is
here
unless
it
is
my
sunday
books
without
asking
alice
first
she
is
a
most
extraordinary
child
said
gillespie
she
is
a
child
said
chauncey
yes
mamma
and
that
is
what
i
wanted
to
say
i
do
not
think
ellen
is
so
polite
because
she
is
so
much
with
alice
and
john
but
because
she
is
so
sweet
and
good
i
do
think
she
could
being
polite
it
is
not
that
said
gillespie
mere
sweetness
and
goodness
would
never
give
so
much
elegance
of
manner
as
far
as
i
have
seen
ellen
montgomery
is
a
child
that
she
is
said
chauncey
but
neither
would
any
cultivation
or
example
be
sufficient
for
it
without
ellen
thorough
good
principle
and
great
sweetness
of
temper
that
exactly
what
think
mamma
said
ellen
chauncey
ellen
sweetness
of
temper
was
not
entirely
born
with
her
it
was
one
of
the
blessed
fruits
of
religion
and
discipline
discipline
has
not
done
with
it
yet
when
the
winter
came
on
and
the
housework
grew
less
and
with
renewed
vigour
she
was
bending
herself
to
improvement
in
all
sorts
of
ways
it
unluckily
came
into
miss
fortune
head
that
some
of
ellen
spare
time
might
be
turned
to
account
in
a
new
line
with
this
lady
to
propose
and
to
do
were
two
things
always
very
near
together
the
very
next
day
ellen
was
summoned
to
help
her
downstairs
with
the
big
most
unsuspiciously
and
with
her
accustomed
pleasantness
ellen
did
it
but
when
she
was
sent
up
again
for
the
rolls
of
wool
and
miss
fortune
after
setting
up
the
wheel
put
one
of
them
into
her
hand
and
instructed
her
how
to
draw
out
and
twist
the
thread
of
yarn
she
saw
all
that
was
coming
she
saw
it
with
dismay
so
much
yarn
as
miss
fortune
might
think
it
well
she
should
spin
so
much
time
must
be
taken
daily
from
her
beloved
reading
and
writing
drawing
and
studying
her
very
heart
sank
within
her
she
made
no
remonstrance
unless
her
disconsolate
face
might
be
thought
one
she
stood
half
a
day
at
the
big
fretting
secretly
while
miss
fortune
went
round
with
an
inward
chuckle
visible
in
her
countenance
that
in
spite
of
herself
increased
ellen
vexation
and
this
was
not
the
annoyance
of
a
day
she
must
expect
it
day
after
day
through
the
whole
winter
it
was
a
grievous
trial
ellen
cried
for
a
great
while
when
she
got
to
her
own
room
and
a
long
hard
struggle
was
necessary
before
she
could
resolve
to
do
her
duty
to
be
patient
and
quiet
and
spin
nobody
knows
how
much
yarn
and
my
poor
history
and
philosophy
and
drawing
and
french
and
reading
ellen
cried
very
heartily
but
she
knew
what
she
ought
to
do
she
prayed
long
humbly
earnestly
that
her
little
rushlight
might
shine
bright
and
her
aunt
had
no
cause
to
complain
of
her
sometimes
if
overpressed
ellen
would
ask
miss
fortune
to
let
her
stop
saying
as
alice
had
advised
her
that
wished
to
have
her
do
such
and
such
things
miss
fortune
never
made
any
objection
and
the
hours
of
spinning
that
wrought
so
many
knots
of
yarn
for
her
aunt
wrought
better
things
yet
for
the
little
spinner
patience
and
gentleness
grew
with
the
practice
of
them
this
wearisome
work
was
one
of
the
many
seemingly
untoward
things
which
in
reality
bring
out
good
the
time
ellen
secure
to
herself
was
held
the
more
precious
and
used
the
more
carefully
after
all
it
was
a
very
profitable
and
pleasant
winter
to
her
john
visit
came
as
usual
at
the
holidays
and
was
enjoyed
as
usual
only
that
every
one
seemed
to
ellen
more
pleasant
than
the
last
the
sole
other
event
that
broke
the
quiet
course
of
things
beside
the
journeys
to
ventnor
was
the
death
of
van
brunt
this
happened
very
unexpectedly
and
after
a
short
illness
not
far
from
the
end
of
january
ellen
was
very
sorry
both
for
her
own
sake
and
van
brunt
who
she
was
sure
felt
much
though
according
to
his
general
custom
he
said
nothing
ellen
felt
for
him
none
the
less
she
little
thought
what
an
important
bearing
this
event
would
have
upon
her
own
future
the
winter
passed
and
the
spring
came
one
fine
mild
pleasant
afternoon
early
in
may
van
brunt
came
into
the
kitchen
and
asked
ellen
if
she
wanted
to
go
with
him
and
see
the
sheep
salted
ellen
was
seated
at
the
table
with
a
large
tin
pan
in
her
lap
and
before
her
a
huge
heap
of
white
beans
which
she
was
picking
over
for
the
saturday
favourite
dish
of
pork
and
beans
she
looked
up
at
him
with
a
hopeless
face
i
should
like
to
go
very
much
indeed
van
brunt
but
you
see
i
ca
all
these
to
do
beans
eh
said
he
putting
one
or
two
in
his
mouth
where
your
aunt
ellen
pointed
to
the
buttery
he
immediately
went
to
the
door
and
rapped
on
it
with
his
knuckles
here
said
he
ca
you
let
this
child
go
with
me
i
want
her
along
to
help
feed
the
sheep
to
ellen
astonishment
her
aunt
called
to
her
through
the
closed
door
to
go
along
and
leave
the
beans
till
she
came
back
joyfully
ellen
obeyed
she
turned
her
back
upon
the
beans
careless
of
the
big
heap
which
would
still
be
there
to
pick
over
when
she
returned
and
ran
to
get
her
bonnet
in
all
the
time
she
had
been
at
thirlwall
something
had
always
prevented
her
seeing
the
sheep
fed
with
salt
and
she
went
eagerly
out
of
the
door
with
van
brunt
to
a
new
pleasure
they
crossed
two
or
three
meadows
back
of
the
barn
to
a
low
rocky
hill
covered
with
trees
on
the
other
side
of
this
they
came
to
a
fine
field
of
spring
wheat
footsteps
must
not
go
over
the
young
grain
ellen
and
van
brunt
coasted
carefully
round
by
the
fence
to
another
piece
of
rocky
woodland
that
lay
on
the
far
side
of
the
wheatfield
it
was
a
very
fine
afternoon
the
grass
was
green
in
the
meadow
the
trees
were
beginning
to
show
their
leaves
the
air
was
soft
and
in
great
glee
ellen
danced
along
luckily
needing
no
entertainment
from
van
brunt
who
was
devoted
to
his
his
natural
taciturnity
seemed
greater
than
ever
he
amused
himself
all
the
way
over
the
meadow
with
turning
over
his
salt
and
tasting
it
till
ellen
laughingly
told
him
she
believed
he
was
as
fond
of
it
as
the
sheep
were
and
then
he
took
to
chucking
little
bits
of
it
right
and
left
at
anything
he
saw
that
was
big
enough
to
serve
for
a
mark
ellen
stopped
him
again
by
laughing
at
his
wastefulness
and
so
they
came
to
the
wood
she
left
him
then
to
do
as
he
liked
while
she
ran
hither
and
thither
to
search
for
flowers
it
was
slow
getting
through
the
wood
he
was
fain
to
stop
and
wait
for
her
are
these
lovely
said
ellen
as
she
came
up
with
her
hands
full
of
anemones
and
look
there
the
liverwort
i
thought
it
must
be
out
before
now
the
dear
little
thing
but
i
ca
find
any
van
brunt
i
guess
they
gone
said
van
brunt
i
suppose
they
must
said
ellen
i
am
sorry
i
like
them
so
much
oh
i
believe
i
did
get
them
earlier
than
this
two
years
ago
when
i
used
to
take
so
many
walks
with
you
only
think
of
my
not
having
been
to
look
for
flowers
before
this
spring
it
had
ought
to
ha
happened
so
that
a
fact
said
van
brunt
i
do
know
how
it
has
oh
there
are
my
yellow
bells
exclaimed
ellen
oh
you
beauties
are
they
van
brunt
i
wo
say
but
what
i
think
an
ear
of
wheat
handsomer
said
he
with
his
half
smile
why
van
brunt
how
can
you
but
an
ear
of
wheat
pretty
too
oh
van
brunt
what
that
do
you
get
me
some
of
it
will
you
please
oh
how
beautiful
what
is
it
that
black
birch
said
he
kind
o
handsome
stop
i
find
you
some
oak
blossoms
directly
there
some
solomon
seal
do
you
want
some
of
that
ellen
sprang
to
it
with
exclamations
of
joy
and
before
she
could
rise
from
her
stooping
posture
discovered
some
cowslips
to
be
scrambled
for
wild
columbine
the
delicate
corydalis
and
more
uvularias
which
she
called
yellow
bells
were
added
to
her
handful
till
it
grew
a
very
elegant
bunch
indeed
van
brunt
looked
complacently
on
much
as
ellen
would
at
a
kitten
running
round
after
its
tail
now
i
wo
keep
you
any
longer
van
brunt
said
she
when
her
hands
were
as
full
as
they
could
hold
i
have
kept
you
a
great
while
you
are
very
good
to
wait
for
me
they
took
up
their
line
of
march
again
and
after
crossing
the
last
piece
of
rocky
woodland
came
to
an
open
hillside
sloping
gently
up
at
the
foot
of
which
were
several
large
flat
stones
but
where
are
the
sheep
van
brunt
said
ellen
i
guess
they
ai
fur
said
he
you
keep
quiet
they
know
you
and
they
are
mighty
scary
just
stand
still
there
by
the
fence
nan
nan
nan
nan
nan
nan
this
was
the
sheep
call
and
raising
his
voice
van
brunt
made
it
sound
abroad
far
over
the
hills
again
and
again
it
sounded
and
then
ellen
saw
the
white
nose
of
a
sheep
at
the
edge
of
the
woods
on
the
top
of
the
hill
on
the
call
sounding
again
the
sheep
set
forward
and
in
a
long
train
they
came
running
along
a
narrow
footpath
down
towards
where
van
brunt
was
standing
with
his
pan
the
soft
tramp
of
a
multitude
of
light
hoofs
in
another
direction
turned
ellen
eyes
that
way
and
there
were
two
more
single
files
of
sheep
running
down
the
hill
from
different
points
in
the
woodland
the
pretty
things
came
scampering
along
seeming
in
a
great
hurry
till
they
got
very
near
then
the
whole
multitude
came
to
a
sudden
halt
and
looked
very
wistfully
and
doubtfully
indeed
at
van
brunt
and
the
strange
little
figure
standing
so
still
by
the
fence
they
seemed
in
great
doubt
every
sheep
of
them
whether
van
brunt
was
not
a
traitor
who
had
put
on
a
friend
voice
and
lured
them
down
there
with
some
dark
evil
intent
which
he
was
going
to
carry
out
by
means
of
that
same
stranger
by
the
fence
ellen
almost
expected
to
see
them
turn
about
and
go
as
fast
as
they
had
come
but
van
brunt
gently
repeating
his
call
went
quietly
up
to
the
nearest
stone
and
began
to
scatter
the
salt
upon
it
full
in
their
view
doubt
was
at
an
end
he
had
hung
out
the
white
flag
they
flocked
down
to
the
stones
no
longer
at
all
in
fear
of
and
crowded
to
get
at
the
salt
the
rocks
where
it
was
strewn
were
covered
with
more
sheep
than
ellen
would
have
thought
it
possible
could
stand
upon
them
they
were
like
pieces
of
floating
ice
heaped
up
with
snow
or
queen
cakes
with
an
immoderately
thick
frosting
it
was
one
scene
of
pushing
and
crowding
those
which
had
not
had
their
share
of
the
feast
forcing
themselves
to
get
at
it
and
shoving
others
off
in
consequence
ellen
was
wonderfully
pleased
it
was
a
new
and
pretty
sight
the
busy
hustling
crowd
of
gentle
creatures
with
the
soft
noise
of
their
tread
upon
grass
and
stones
and
the
eager
devouring
of
the
salt
she
was
fixed
with
pleasure
looking
and
listening
and
did
not
move
till
the
entertainment
was
over
and
the
body
of
the
flock
were
carelessly
scattering
here
and
there
while
a
few
that
had
perhaps
been
disappointed
of
their
part
still
lingered
upon
the
stones
in
the
vain
hope
of
yet
licking
a
little
saltness
from
them
well
said
ellen
i
never
knew
what
salt
was
worth
before
how
they
do
love
it
is
it
good
for
them
van
brunt
good
for
them
said
he
to
be
sure
it
is
good
for
them
there
ai
a
critter
that
walks
as
i
know
that
it
ai
good
for
chickens
and
it
very
queer
it
kills
them
they
turned
to
go
homeward
ellen
had
taken
the
empty
pan
to
lay
her
flowers
in
thinking
it
would
be
better
for
them
than
the
heat
of
her
hand
and
greatly
pleased
with
what
she
had
come
to
see
and
enjoying
her
walk
as
much
as
it
was
possible
she
was
going
home
very
happy
yet
she
could
not
help
missing
van
brunt
old
sociableness
he
was
uncommonly
silent
even
for
him
considering
that
he
and
ellen
were
alone
together
and
she
wondered
what
had
possessed
him
with
a
desire
to
cut
down
all
the
young
saplings
he
came
to
that
were
large
enough
for
walking
sticks
he
did
not
want
to
make
any
use
of
them
that
was
certain
for
as
fast
as
he
cut
and
trimmed
out
one
he
threw
it
away
and
cut
another
ellen
was
glad
when
they
got
out
into
the
open
fields
where
there
were
none
to
be
found
it
is
just
about
this
time
a
year
ago
said
she
that
aunt
fortune
was
getting
well
of
her
long
fit
of
sickness
yes
said
van
brunt
with
a
very
profound
air
something
is
always
happening
most
years
ellen
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
this
philosophical
remark
i
am
very
glad
nothing
is
happening
this
year
said
she
i
think
it
is
a
great
deal
pleasanter
to
have
things
go
on
quietly
oh
something
might
happen
without
hindering
things
going
on
quietly
i
might
it
i
do
know
said
ellen
wonderingly
why
van
brunt
what
going
to
happen
i
declare
said
he
half
laughing
you
as
cute
as
a
razor
i
did
say
there
was
anything
going
to
happen
did
i
but
is
there
said
ellen
your
aunt
said
nothing
to
you
about
it
why
no
said
ellen
she
never
tells
me
anything
what
is
it
why
the
story
is
said
van
brunt
at
least
i
know
for
understood
as
much
from
herself
that
i
believe
she
is
going
to
be
married
before
long
she
exclaimed
ellen
married
aunt
fortune
i
believe
so
said
van
brunt
making
a
lunge
at
a
tuft
of
tall
grass
and
pulling
off
two
or
three
spears
of
it
which
he
carried
to
his
mouth
there
was
a
long
silence
during
which
ellen
saw
nothing
in
earth
air
or
sky
and
knew
no
longer
whether
she
was
passing
through
woodland
or
meadow
to
frame
words
into
another
sentence
was
past
her
power
they
came
in
sight
of
the
barn
at
length
she
would
not
have
much
more
time
will
it
be
soon
van
brunt
why
pretty
soon
as
soon
as
next
week
i
guess
so
i
thought
it
was
time
you
ought
to
be
told
do
you
know
to
who
i
do
said
ellen
in
a
low
voice
i
could
help
guessing
i
reckon
you
guessed
about
right
said
he
without
looking
at
her
there
was
another
silence
during
which
it
seemed
to
ellen
that
her
thoughts
were
tumbling
head
over
heels
they
were
in
such
confusion
the
short
and
the
long
of
it
is
said
van
brunt
as
they
rounded
the
corner
of
the
barn
we
have
made
up
our
minds
to
draw
in
the
same
yoke
and
we
both
on
us
pretty
folks
so
i
guess
contrive
to
pull
the
cart
along
i
had
just
as
lief
tell
you
ellen
that
all
this
was
as
good
as
settled
a
long
spell
back
ever
you
came
to
thirlwall
but
i
was
never
agoing
to
leave
my
old
mother
without
a
home
so
i
stuck
to
her
and
would
to
the
end
of
time
if
i
had
never
been
married
but
now
she
is
gone
and
there
is
nothing
to
keep
me
to
the
old
place
any
longer
so
now
you
know
the
hull
on
it
and
i
wanted
you
should
with
this
particularly
cool
statement
of
his
matrimonial
views
van
brunt
turned
off
into
the
leaving
ellen
to
go
home
by
herself
she
felt
as
if
she
were
walking
on
air
while
she
crossed
the
and
the
very
house
had
a
seeming
of
unreality
mechanically
she
put
her
flowers
in
water
and
sat
down
to
finish
the
beans
but
the
beans
might
have
been
flowers
and
the
flowers
beans
for
all
the
difference
ellen
saw
in
them
miss
fortune
and
she
shunned
each
faces
most
carefully
for
a
long
time
ellen
felt
it
impossible
to
meet
her
eyes
and
it
is
a
matter
of
great
uncertainty
which
in
fact
did
first
look
at
the
other
other
than
this
there
was
no
manner
of
difference
in
anything
without
or
within
the
house
van
being
absolutely
speechless
was
not
a
uncommon
thing
chapter
xli
poor
little
pretty
fluttering
thing
must
we
no
longer
live
together
and
dost
thou
prune
thy
trembling
wing
to
take
thy
flight
thou
knowest
not
whither
prior
as
soon
as
she
could
ellen
carried
this
wonderful
news
to
alice
and
eagerly
poured
out
the
whole
story
her
walk
and
all
she
was
somewhat
disappointed
at
the
calmness
of
her
hearer
but
you
do
seem
half
as
surprised
as
i
expected
alice
i
thought
you
would
be
so
much
surprised
i
am
not
surprised
at
all
ellie
not
are
you
why
did
you
know
anything
of
this
before
i
did
not
but
i
suspected
i
thought
it
was
very
likely
i
am
glad
it
is
so
glad
are
you
glad
i
am
so
sorry
why
are
you
glad
alice
why
are
you
sorry
ellie
oh
because
i
do
know
it
seems
so
queer
i
do
like
it
at
all
i
am
very
sorry
indeed
for
your
aunt
sake
or
for
van
brunt
sake
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
do
you
think
he
or
she
will
be
a
loser
by
the
bargain
why
he
to
be
sure
i
think
he
will
i
do
think
she
will
i
think
he
is
a
great
deal
too
good
and
besides
i
wonder
if
he
wants
to
really
it
was
settled
so
long
ago
he
has
changed
his
mind
since
have
you
any
reason
to
think
so
ellie
said
alice
smiling
i
do
know
i
do
think
he
seemed
particularly
glad
it
will
be
safest
to
conclude
that
van
brunt
knows
his
own
mind
my
dear
and
it
is
certainly
pleasanter
for
us
to
hope
so
but
then
besides
said
ellen
with
a
face
of
great
perplexity
and
vexation
i
do
know
it
do
seem
right
how
can
i
ever
must
i
do
you
think
i
shall
have
to
call
him
anything
but
van
brunt
alice
could
not
help
smiling
again
what
is
your
objection
ellie
why
because
i
i
could
do
it
somehow
it
would
seem
so
strange
must
i
alice
why
in
the
world
are
you
glad
dear
alice
it
smooths
my
way
for
a
plan
i
have
had
in
my
head
you
will
know
why
i
am
glad
ellie
well
i
am
glad
if
you
are
glad
said
ellen
sighing
i
do
know
why
i
was
so
sorry
i
could
help
it
i
suppose
i
sha
mind
it
after
a
while
she
sat
for
a
few
minutes
musing
over
the
possibility
or
impossibility
of
ever
forming
her
lips
to
the
words
uncle
abraham
uncle
van
brunt
or
barely
uncle
her
soul
rebelled
against
all
three
yet
if
he
should
think
me
unkind
then
i
must
oh
rather
fifty
times
over
than
that
looking
up
she
saw
a
change
in
alice
countenance
and
tenderly
asked
what
is
the
matter
oh
dear
alice
what
are
you
thinking
about
i
am
thinking
ellie
how
i
shall
tell
you
something
that
will
give
you
pain
pain
you
need
be
afraid
of
giving
me
pain
said
ellen
fondly
throwing
her
arms
around
her
tell
me
dear
alice
is
it
something
i
have
done
that
is
wrong
what
is
it
alice
kissed
her
and
burst
into
tears
what
is
the
matter
oh
dear
alice
said
ellen
encircling
alice
head
with
both
her
arms
oh
do
cry
do
tell
me
what
it
is
it
is
only
sorrow
for
you
dear
ellie
but
why
said
ellen
in
some
alarm
why
are
you
sorry
for
me
i
care
if
it
do
trouble
you
indeed
i
do
never
mind
me
is
it
something
that
troubles
you
dear
alice
no
except
for
the
effect
it
may
have
on
others
then
i
can
bear
it
said
ellen
you
need
not
be
afraid
to
tell
me
dear
alice
what
is
it
do
be
sorry
for
me
but
the
expression
of
alice
face
was
such
that
she
could
not
help
being
afraid
to
hear
she
anxiously
repeated
what
is
it
alice
fondly
smoothed
back
the
hair
from
her
brow
looking
herself
somewhat
anxiously
and
somewhat
sadly
upon
the
uplifted
face
suppose
ellie
she
said
at
length
that
you
and
i
were
taking
a
journey
together
a
troublesome
dangerous
journey
and
that
had
a
way
of
getting
at
once
safe
to
the
end
of
it
would
you
be
willing
to
let
me
go
and
you
do
without
me
for
the
rest
of
the
way
i
would
rather
you
should
take
me
with
you
said
ellen
in
a
kind
of
maze
of
wonder
and
fear
why
where
are
you
going
alice
i
think
i
am
going
home
ellie
before
you
home
said
ellen
yes
home
i
feel
it
to
be
it
is
not
a
strange
land
i
thank
god
it
is
my
i
am
going
to
ellen
sat
looking
at
her
stupefied
it
is
your
home
too
love
i
trust
and
believe
said
alice
tenderly
we
shall
be
together
at
last
i
am
not
sorry
for
myself
i
only
grieve
to
leave
you
alone
and
others
but
god
knows
best
we
must
both
look
to
him
why
alice
said
ellen
starting
up
suddenly
what
do
you
mean
what
do
you
mean
i
do
understand
you
what
do
you
mean
do
you
not
understand
me
ellie
but
alice
but
alice
alice
what
makes
you
say
so
is
there
anything
the
matter
with
you
do
i
look
well
ellie
with
an
eye
sharpened
to
painful
keenness
ellen
sought
in
alice
face
for
the
tokens
of
what
she
wished
and
what
she
feared
it
once
or
twice
lately
flitted
through
her
mind
that
alice
was
very
thin
and
seemed
to
want
her
old
strength
whether
in
riding
or
walking
or
any
other
exertion
and
it
struck
her
that
the
bright
spots
of
colour
in
alice
face
were
just
like
what
her
mother
cheeks
used
to
wear
in
her
last
illness
these
thoughts
had
just
come
and
gone
but
now
as
she
recalled
them
and
was
forced
to
acknowledge
the
justness
of
them
and
her
review
of
alice
face
pressed
them
home
anew
hope
for
a
moment
faded
she
grew
white
even
to
the
lips
my
poor
ellie
my
poor
ellie
said
alice
pressing
her
little
sister
to
her
bosom
it
must
be
we
must
say
lord
will
be
done
we
must
not
forget
he
does
all
things
well
but
ellen
rallied
she
raised
her
head
again
she
could
not
believe
what
alice
had
told
her
to
her
mind
it
seemed
an
evil
great
to
it
could
not
be
alice
saw
this
in
her
look
and
again
sadly
stroked
her
hair
from
her
brow
it
must
be
ellie
she
repeated
but
have
you
seen
somebody
have
you
asked
somebody
said
ellen
some
doctor
i
have
seen
and
i
have
asked
said
alice
it
was
not
necessary
but
i
have
done
both
they
think
as
i
do
but
these
thirlwall
doctors
not
them
i
did
not
apply
to
them
i
saw
an
excellent
physician
at
randolph
the
last
time
i
went
to
ventnor
and
he
said
as
i
have
told
you
ellen
countenance
fell
fell
it
is
easier
for
me
to
leave
you
than
for
you
to
be
left
i
know
that
my
dear
little
ellie
you
have
no
reason
to
be
sorry
for
me
i
sorry
for
you
but
the
hand
that
is
taking
me
away
is
one
that
will
touch
neither
of
us
but
to
do
us
good
i
know
that
too
we
must
both
look
away
to
our
dear
saviour
and
not
for
a
moment
doubt
his
love
i
do
not
you
must
not
is
it
not
said
that
loved
martha
and
her
sister
and
lazarus
yes
said
ellen
who
never
stirred
her
eyes
from
alice
and
might
he
not
did
it
not
rest
with
a
word
of
his
lips
to
keep
lazarus
from
dying
and
save
his
sisters
from
all
the
bitter
sorrow
his
death
caused
them
again
ellen
said
yes
or
her
lips
seemed
to
say
it
and
yet
there
were
reasons
good
reasons
why
he
should
not
little
as
poor
martha
and
mary
could
understand
it
but
had
he
at
all
ceased
to
when
he
bade
all
that
trouble
come
do
you
remember
ellie
oh
how
beautiful
those
words
are
when
at
last
he
arrived
near
the
place
and
first
one
sister
came
to
him
with
the
touching
reminder
that
he
might
have
saved
them
from
this
and
then
the
other
weeping
and
falling
at
his
feet
and
repeating
if
thou
hadst
been
here
when
he
saw
their
tears
and
more
saw
the
torn
hearts
that
tears
could
not
ease
he
even
wept
with
them
too
oh
i
thank
god
for
those
words
he
saw
reason
to
strike
and
his
hand
did
not
spare
but
his
love
shed
tears
for
them
and
he
is
just
the
same
now
some
drops
fell
from
alice
eyes
not
sorrowful
ones
ellen
had
hid
her
face
let
us
never
doubt
his
love
dear
ellie
and
surely
then
we
can
bear
whatever
that
love
may
bring
upon
us
i
do
trust
it
i
do
believe
it
shall
be
well
with
them
that
fear
god
i
believe
it
will
be
well
for
me
when
i
die
well
for
you
my
dear
dear
ellie
well
even
for
my
father
she
did
not
finish
the
sentence
afraid
to
trust
herself
but
oh
ellen
knew
what
it
would
have
been
and
it
suddenly
startled
into
life
all
the
load
of
grief
that
had
been
settling
heavily
on
her
heart
her
thoughts
had
not
looked
that
way
before
now
when
they
did
this
new
vision
of
misery
was
too
much
to
bear
quite
unable
to
contain
herself
and
unwilling
to
pain
alice
more
than
she
could
help
with
a
smothered
burst
of
feeling
she
sprang
away
out
of
the
door
into
the
woods
where
she
would
be
unseen
and
unheard
and
there
in
the
first
burst
of
her
agony
ellen
almost
thought
she
should
die
her
grief
had
not
now
indeed
the
goading
sting
of
impatience
she
knew
the
hand
that
gave
the
blow
and
did
not
raise
her
own
against
it
she
believed
too
what
alice
had
been
saying
and
the
sense
of
it
was
in
a
manner
present
with
her
in
her
darkest
time
but
her
spirit
died
within
her
she
bowed
her
head
as
if
she
were
never
to
lift
it
up
again
and
she
was
ready
to
say
with
job
what
good
is
my
life
to
me
it
was
long
very
long
after
when
slowly
and
mournfully
she
came
in
again
to
kiss
alice
before
going
back
to
her
aunt
she
would
have
done
it
hurriedly
and
turned
away
but
alice
held
her
and
looked
sadly
for
a
minute
into
the
little
face
then
clasped
her
close
and
kissed
her
again
and
again
oh
alice
sobbed
ellen
on
her
neck
are
you
mistaken
maybe
you
are
mistaken
i
am
not
mistaken
my
dear
ellie
my
own
ellie
said
alice
clear
sweet
voice
nor
sorry
except
for
others
i
will
talk
with
you
more
about
this
you
will
be
sorry
for
me
at
first
and
then
i
hope
you
will
be
glad
it
is
only
that
i
am
going
home
a
little
before
you
remember
what
i
was
saying
to
you
a
while
ago
will
you
tell
van
brunt
i
should
like
to
see
him
for
a
few
minutes
some
time
when
he
has
leisure
and
come
to
me
early
love
ellen
could
hardly
get
home
her
blinded
eyes
could
not
see
where
she
was
stepping
and
again
and
again
her
fulness
of
heart
got
the
better
of
everything
else
and
unmindful
of
the
growing
twilight
she
sat
down
on
a
stone
by
the
wayside
or
flung
herself
on
the
ground
to
let
sorrows
have
full
sway
in
one
of
these
fits
of
bitter
struggling
with
pain
there
came
on
her
mind
like
a
sunbeam
across
a
cloud
the
thought
of
jesus
weeping
at
the
grave
of
lazarus
it
came
with
singular
power
did
he
love
them
so
well
thought
ellen
and
is
he
looking
down
upon
us
with
the
same
tenderness
even
now
she
felt
that
the
sun
was
shining
still
though
the
cloud
might
be
between
her
broken
heart
crept
to
his
feet
and
laid
its
burden
there
and
after
a
few
minutes
she
rose
up
and
went
on
her
way
keeping
that
thought
still
close
to
her
heart
the
unspeakable
tears
that
were
shed
during
those
few
minutes
were
that
softened
outpouring
of
the
heart
that
leaves
it
eased
very
very
sorrowful
as
she
was
she
went
on
calmly
now
and
stopped
no
more
it
was
getting
dark
and
a
little
way
from
the
gate
on
the
road
she
met
van
brunt
why
i
was
beginning
to
get
scared
about
you
said
he
i
was
coming
to
see
where
you
was
how
come
you
so
late
ellen
made
no
answer
and
as
he
now
came
nearer
and
he
could
see
more
distinctly
his
tone
changed
what
the
matter
said
he
you
been
well
what
has
happened
what
ails
you
ellen
in
astonishment
and
then
in
alarm
he
saw
that
she
was
unable
to
speak
and
anxiously
and
kindly
begged
her
to
let
him
know
what
was
the
matter
and
if
he
could
do
anything
ellen
shook
her
head
ai
miss
alice
well
said
he
you
heerd
no
bad
news
up
there
on
the
hill
have
you
ellen
was
not
willing
to
answer
this
question
with
yea
or
nay
she
recovered
herself
enough
to
give
him
alice
message
i
be
sure
and
go
said
he
but
you
told
me
yet
what
the
matter
has
anything
happened
no
said
ellen
do
ask
me
she
tell
you
do
ask
me
i
guess
i
go
up
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
then
said
he
before
breakfast
no
said
ellen
better
not
perhaps
she
would
be
up
so
early
after
breakfast
then
i
go
up
right
after
breakfast
i
was
agoing
with
the
boys
up
into
that
wheat
lot
but
anyhow
i
do
that
first
they
wo
have
a
chance
to
do
much
bad
or
good
before
i
get
back
to
them
i
reckon
as
soon
as
possible
she
made
her
escape
from
miss
fortune
eye
and
questions
of
curiosity
which
she
could
not
bear
to
answer
and
got
to
her
own
room
there
the
first
thing
she
did
was
to
find
the
eleventh
chapter
of
john
she
read
it
as
she
never
had
read
it
before
she
found
in
it
what
she
never
had
found
before
one
of
those
cordials
that
none
but
the
sorrowing
drink
on
the
love
of
christ
as
there
shown
little
ellen
heart
fastened
and
with
that
one
sweetening
thought
amid
all
its
deep
sadness
her
sleep
that
night
might
have
been
envied
by
many
a
luxurious
roller
in
pleasure
at
alice
wish
she
immediately
took
up
her
quarters
at
the
parsonage
to
leave
her
no
more
but
she
could
not
see
much
difference
in
her
from
what
she
had
been
for
several
weeks
past
and
with
the
natural
hopefulness
of
childhood
her
mind
presently
almost
refused
to
believe
the
extremity
of
the
evil
which
had
been
threatened
alice
herself
was
constantly
cheerful
and
sought
by
all
means
to
further
cheerfulness
though
careful
at
the
same
time
to
forbid
as
far
as
she
could
the
rising
of
the
hope
she
saw
ellen
was
inclined
to
cherish
one
evening
they
were
sitting
together
at
the
window
looking
out
upon
the
same
old
lawn
and
distant
landscape
now
in
all
the
fresh
greenness
of
the
young
spring
the
woods
were
not
yet
in
full
leaf
and
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
upon
the
trees
bordering
the
other
side
of
the
lawn
showed
them
in
the
most
exquisite
and
varied
shades
of
colour
some
had
the
tender
green
of
the
new
leaf
some
were
in
the
red
or
yellow
browns
of
the
bud
others
in
various
stages
of
forwardness
mixing
all
the
tints
between
and
the
evergreens
standing
dark
as
ever
setting
off
the
delicate
hues
of
the
surrounding
foliage
this
was
all
softened
off
in
the
distance
the
very
light
of
the
spring
was
mild
and
tender
compared
with
that
of
other
seasons
and
the
air
that
stole
round
the
corner
of
the
house
and
came
in
at
the
open
window
was
laden
with
aromatic
fragrance
alice
and
ellen
had
been
for
some
time
silently
breathing
it
and
gazing
thoughtfully
on
the
loveliness
that
was
abroad
i
used
to
think
said
alice
that
it
must
be
a
very
hard
thing
to
leave
such
a
beautiful
world
did
you
ever
think
so
ellie
i
do
know
said
ellen
faintly
i
do
remember
i
used
to
think
so
said
alice
but
i
do
not
now
ellie
my
feeling
has
changed
do
feel
so
now
ellie
oh
why
do
you
talk
about
it
dear
alice
for
many
reasons
dear
ellie
come
here
and
sit
in
my
lap
again
i
am
afraid
you
can
not
bear
it
yes
i
can
sit
here
and
let
your
head
rest
where
it
used
to
and
alice
laid
her
cheek
upon
ellen
forehead
you
are
a
great
comfort
to
me
dear
ellie
oh
alice
do
say
so
you
kill
me
exclaimed
ellen
in
great
distress
why
should
i
not
say
so
love
said
alice
soothingly
i
like
to
say
it
and
you
will
be
glad
to
know
it
you
are
a
comfort
to
me
and
what
have
you
been
to
me
said
ellen
weeping
bitterly
what
i
can
not
be
much
longer
and
i
want
to
accustom
you
to
think
of
it
and
to
think
of
it
rightly
i
want
you
to
know
that
if
i
am
sorry
at
all
in
the
thought
it
is
for
the
sake
of
others
not
myself
ellie
you
yourself
will
be
glad
for
me
in
a
little
while
you
will
not
wish
me
back
ellen
shook
her
head
i
know
you
will
not
after
a
while
and
i
shall
leave
you
in
good
hands
i
have
arranged
for
that
my
dear
little
sister
the
sorrowing
child
neither
knew
nor
cared
what
she
meant
but
a
mute
caress
answered
the
of
alice
words
look
up
ellie
look
out
again
lovely
lovely
all
that
is
but
i
know
heaven
is
a
great
deal
more
lovely
feasted
as
our
eyes
are
with
beauty
i
believe
that
eye
has
not
seen
nor
heart
imagined
the
things
that
god
has
prepared
for
them
that
love
him
believe
that
ellie
you
must
not
be
so
sorry
that
i
have
gone
to
see
it
a
little
before
you
ellen
could
say
nothing
after
all
ellie
it
is
not
beautiful
things
nor
a
beautiful
world
that
make
people
happy
it
is
loving
and
being
loved
and
that
is
the
reason
why
i
am
happy
in
the
thought
of
heaven
i
shall
if
he
receives
me
i
shall
be
with
my
saviour
i
shall
see
him
and
know
him
without
any
of
the
clouds
that
come
between
here
i
am
often
forgetting
and
displeasing
him
now
never
serving
him
well
nor
loving
him
right
i
shall
be
glad
to
find
myself
where
all
that
will
be
done
with
for
ever
i
shall
be
like
him
why
do
you
cry
so
ellie
said
alice
tenderly
i
ca
help
it
alice
it
is
only
my
love
for
you
and
for
two
more
that
could
make
me
wish
to
stay
here
nothing
else
and
i
give
all
that
up
because
i
do
not
know
what
is
best
for
you
or
myself
and
i
look
to
meet
you
all
again
before
long
try
to
think
of
it
as
i
do
ellie
but
what
shall
i
do
without
you
said
poor
ellen
i
will
tell
you
ellie
you
must
come
here
and
take
my
place
and
take
care
of
those
i
leave
behind
will
you
and
they
will
take
care
of
you
but
said
ellen
looking
up
eagerly
aunt
fortune
i
have
managed
all
that
will
you
do
it
ellen
i
shall
feel
easy
and
happy
about
you
and
far
easier
and
happier
about
my
father
if
i
leave
you
established
here
to
be
to
him
as
far
as
you
can
what
i
have
been
will
you
promise
me
ellie
in
words
it
was
not
possible
but
what
silent
kisses
and
the
close
pressure
of
the
arms
round
alice
neck
could
say
was
said
i
am
satisfied
then
said
alice
presently
my
father
will
be
your
father
think
him
so
dear
ellie
and
i
know
john
will
take
care
of
you
and
my
place
will
not
be
empty
i
am
very
very
glad
ellen
felt
her
place
surely
would
be
empty
but
she
could
not
say
so
it
was
for
this
i
was
so
glad
of
your
aunt
marriage
ellie
alice
soon
went
on
i
foresaw
she
might
raise
some
difficulties
in
my
way
hard
to
remove
perhaps
but
now
i
have
seen
van
brunt
and
he
has
promised
me
that
nothing
shall
hinder
your
taking
up
your
abode
and
making
your
home
entirely
here
though
i
believe
ellie
he
would
truly
have
loved
to
have
you
in
his
own
house
i
am
sure
he
would
said
ellen
but
oh
how
much
rather
he
behaved
very
well
about
it
the
other
morning
in
a
very
manly
frank
kind
way
showed
a
good
deal
of
feeling
i
think
too
he
gave
me
to
understand
that
for
his
own
sake
he
should
be
extremely
sorry
to
let
you
go
but
he
assured
me
that
nothing
over
which
he
had
any
control
should
stand
in
the
way
of
your
good
he
is
kind
he
is
good
he
is
always
so
said
ellen
i
love
van
brunt
very
much
he
always
was
as
kind
to
me
as
he
could
be
they
were
silent
for
a
few
minutes
and
alice
was
looking
out
of
the
window
again
the
sun
had
set
and
the
colouring
of
all
without
was
graver
yet
it
was
but
the
change
from
one
beauty
to
another
the
sweet
air
seemed
still
sweeter
than
before
the
sun
went
down
you
must
be
happy
dear
ellie
in
knowing
that
i
am
i
am
happy
now
i
enjoy
all
this
and
i
love
you
all
but
i
can
leave
it
and
can
leave
you
yes
both
for
i
would
seek
jesus
he
who
has
taught
me
to
love
him
will
not
forsake
me
now
goodness
and
mercy
have
followed
me
all
the
days
of
my
life
and
i
shall
dwell
in
the
house
of
the
lord
for
ever
i
thank
him
oh
i
thank
him
alice
face
did
not
belie
her
words
though
her
eyes
shone
through
tears
ellie
dear
you
must
love
him
with
all
your
heart
and
live
constantly
in
his
presence
i
know
if
you
do
he
will
make
you
happy
in
any
event
he
can
always
give
more
than
he
takes
away
oh
how
good
he
is
and
what
wretched
returns
we
make
him
i
was
miserable
when
john
first
went
away
to
doncaster
i
did
not
know
how
to
bear
it
but
now
ellie
i
think
i
can
see
it
has
done
me
good
and
i
can
even
be
thankful
for
it
all
things
are
ours
all
things
the
world
and
life
and
death
too
alice
said
ellen
as
well
as
she
could
you
know
what
you
were
saying
to
me
the
other
day
about
what
love
that
about
you
know
that
chapter
about
the
death
of
lazarus
yes
it
has
comforted
me
very
much
so
it
has
me
ellie
it
has
been
exceeding
sweet
to
me
at
different
times
come
sing
to
me
firm
a
foundation
from
time
to
time
alice
led
to
this
kind
of
conversation
both
for
ellen
sake
and
her
own
pleasure
meanwhile
she
made
her
go
on
with
all
her
usual
studies
and
duties
and
but
for
these
talks
ellen
would
have
scarce
known
how
to
believe
that
it
could
be
true
which
she
feared
the
wedding
of
miss
fortune
and
van
brunt
was
a
very
quiet
one
it
happened
at
far
too
busy
a
time
of
year
and
they
were
too
cool
calculators
and
looked
upon
their
union
in
much
too
a
point
of
view
to
dream
of
such
a
wild
thing
as
a
or
even
resolve
upon
so
troublesome
a
thing
as
a
miss
fortune
would
not
have
left
her
cheese
and
to
see
all
the
new
yorks
and
bostons
that
ever
were
built
and
she
would
have
scorned
a
trip
to
randolph
and
van
brunt
would
as
certainly
have
wished
himself
all
the
while
back
among
his
furrows
and
crops
so
one
day
they
were
quietly
married
at
home
the
rev
clark
having
been
fetched
from
thirlwall
for
the
purpose
van
brunt
would
have
preferred
that
humphreys
should
perform
the
ceremony
but
miss
fortune
was
quite
decided
in
favour
of
the
thirlwall
gentleman
and
of
course
he
it
was
the
talk
ran
high
all
over
the
country
on
the
subject
of
this
marriage
and
opinions
were
greatly
divided
some
congratulating
van
brunt
on
having
made
himself
one
of
the
richest
landholders
in
town
by
the
junction
of
another
fat
farm
to
his
own
some
pitying
him
for
having
got
more
than
his
match
within
doors
and
guessing
he
missed
his
reckoning
for
once
if
he
has
then
said
sam
larkins
who
heard
some
of
these
condoling
remarks
it
the
first
time
in
his
life
i
can
tell
you
if
ai
a
little
mistaken
i
wish
i
may
get
a
month
wages
in
a
year
to
come
i
tell
you
you
do
know
van
brunt
he
as
easy
as
anybody
as
long
as
he
do
care
about
what
you
doing
but
if
he
once
takes
a
notion
you
ca
make
him
gee
nor
haw
no
more
than
you
can
our
near
ox
timothy
when
he
out
o
yoke
and
he
as
ugly
a
beast
to
manage
as
ever
i
see
when
he
ai
yoked
up
why
bless
you
there
been
a
thing
done
on
the
farm
this
five
years
but
just
what
he
liked
do
know
it
i
heerd
her
said
sam
chuckling
i
heerd
her
a
telling
him
how
she
wanted
this
thing
done
and
and
he
just
not
say
a
word
and
go
and
do
it
right
way
it
be
a
wonder
if
somebody
ai
considerably
startled
in
her
calculations
afore
out
chapter
xlii
she
enjoys
sure
peace
for
evermore
as
ship
arrived
on
happy
shore
spenser
it
was
impossible
at
first
to
make
humphreys
believe
that
alice
was
right
in
her
notion
about
her
health
the
greatness
of
the
evil
was
such
that
his
mind
refused
to
receive
it
much
as
ellen
had
done
his
unbelief
however
lasted
longer
than
hers
constantly
with
alice
as
she
was
and
talking
to
her
on
the
subject
ellen
slowly
gave
up
the
hope
she
had
clung
to
though
still
bending
all
her
energies
to
the
present
pleasure
and
comfort
of
her
adopted
sister
her
mind
shrank
from
looking
at
the
end
daily
and
hourly
in
every
way
she
strove
to
be
what
alice
said
she
was
a
comfort
to
her
and
she
succeeded
daily
and
hourly
alice
look
and
smile
and
manner
said
the
same
thing
over
and
over
it
was
ellen
precious
reward
and
in
seeking
to
earn
it
she
half
the
time
earned
another
in
forgetting
herself
it
was
different
with
humphreys
he
saw
much
less
of
his
daughter
and
when
he
was
with
her
it
was
impossible
for
alice
with
all
her
efforts
to
speak
to
him
as
freely
and
plainly
as
she
was
in
the
habit
of
speaking
to
ellen
the
consequences
were
such
as
grieved
her
but
could
not
be
helped
as
soon
as
it
was
known
that
her
health
was
failing
sophia
marshman
came
and
took
up
her
abode
at
the
parsonage
ellen
was
almost
sorry
it
broke
up
in
a
measure
the
sweet
and
peaceful
way
of
life
she
and
alice
had
held
together
ever
since
her
own
coming
miss
sophia
could
not
make
a
third
in
their
conversations
but
as
alice
strength
grew
less
and
she
needed
more
attendance
and
help
it
was
plain
her
friend
being
there
was
a
happy
thing
for
both
alice
and
ellen
miss
sophia
was
active
cheerful
untiring
in
her
affectionate
care
always
pleasant
in
manner
and
temper
a
very
useful
person
in
a
house
where
one
was
ailing
vawse
was
often
there
too
and
to
her
ellen
clung
whenever
she
came
as
to
a
pillar
of
strength
miss
sophia
could
do
nothing
to
help
vawse
could
a
great
deal
alice
had
refused
to
write
or
allow
others
to
write
to
her
brother
she
said
he
was
just
finishing
his
course
of
study
at
doncaster
she
would
not
have
him
disturbed
or
broken
off
by
bad
news
from
home
in
august
he
would
be
quite
through
the
first
of
august
he
would
be
home
before
the
middle
of
june
however
her
health
began
to
fail
much
more
rapidly
than
she
had
counted
upon
it
became
too
likely
that
if
she
waited
for
his
regular
return
at
the
first
of
august
she
would
see
but
little
of
her
brother
she
at
last
reluctantly
consented
that
chauncey
should
write
to
him
and
from
that
moment
counted
the
days
her
father
had
scarcely
till
now
given
up
his
old
confidence
respecting
her
he
came
into
her
room
one
morning
when
just
about
to
set
out
for
to
visit
one
or
two
of
his
poor
parishioners
how
are
you
my
daughter
he
asked
tenderly
easy
papa
and
happy
said
alice
you
are
looking
better
said
he
we
shall
have
you
well
again
among
us
yet
there
was
some
sorrow
for
him
in
alice
smile
as
she
looked
up
at
him
and
answered
yes
papa
in
the
land
where
the
inhabitants
shall
no
more
say
am
sick
he
kissed
her
hastily
and
went
out
i
almost
wish
i
was
in
your
place
alice
said
miss
sophia
i
hope
i
may
be
half
as
happy
when
my
time
comes
what
right
have
you
to
hope
so
sophia
said
alice
rather
sadly
to
be
sure
said
the
other
after
a
pause
you
have
been
ten
times
as
good
as
i
do
wonder
you
feel
easy
when
you
look
back
and
think
how
blameless
your
life
has
been
sophia
sophia
said
alice
you
know
it
is
not
that
i
never
did
a
good
thing
in
all
my
life
that
was
not
mixed
and
spoiled
with
evil
i
never
came
up
to
the
full
measure
of
duty
in
any
matter
but
surely
said
miss
sophia
if
one
does
the
best
one
can
it
will
be
accepted
it
wo
do
to
trust
to
that
sophia
god
law
requires
perfection
and
nothing
less
than
perfection
will
be
received
as
payment
of
its
demand
if
you
owe
a
hundred
dollars
and
your
creditor
will
not
hold
you
quit
for
anything
less
than
the
whole
sum
it
is
of
no
manner
of
signification
whether
you
offer
him
ten
or
twenty
why
according
to
that
said
miss
sophia
it
makes
no
difference
what
kind
of
life
one
leads
alice
sighed
and
shook
her
head
the
fruit
shows
what
the
tree
is
love
to
god
strive
to
please
him
always
and
is
it
of
no
use
to
strive
to
please
him
of
no
manner
of
use
if
you
make
that
your
well
i
do
see
what
one
to
trust
to
said
miss
sophia
if
it
is
a
good
life
i
will
answer
you
said
alice
with
a
smile
in
which
there
was
no
sorrow
in
some
words
that
i
love
very
much
of
an
old
scotchman
i
think
have
taken
all
my
good
deeds
and
all
my
bad
and
have
cast
them
together
in
a
heap
before
the
lord
and
from
them
all
i
have
fled
to
jesus
christ
and
in
him
alone
i
have
sweet
peace
sophia
was
silenced
for
a
minute
by
her
look
well
said
she
i
do
understand
it
that
is
what
george
is
always
talking
about
but
i
ca
understand
him
i
am
sorry
you
can
not
said
alice
gravely
they
were
both
silent
for
a
little
while
if
all
christians
were
like
you
said
miss
sophia
i
might
think
more
about
it
but
they
are
such
a
dull
set
there
seems
to
be
no
life
nor
pleasure
among
them
alice
thought
of
these
lines
their
pleasures
rise
to
things
unseen
beyond
the
bounds
of
time
where
neither
eyes
nor
ears
have
been
nor
thoughts
of
mortals
climb
you
judge
she
said
like
the
rest
of
the
world
of
that
which
they
see
not
after
all
know
best
whether
they
are
happy
what
do
you
think
of
mrs
vawse
i
do
know
what
to
think
of
her
she
is
wonderful
to
me
she
is
past
my
comprehension
entirely
do
make
an
example
no
religion
has
done
that
for
me
what
do
you
think
of
your
brother
george
is
happy
there
is
no
doubt
of
that
he
is
the
happiest
person
in
the
family
by
all
odds
but
then
i
think
he
has
a
natural
knack
at
being
happy
it
is
impossible
for
anything
to
put
him
out
alice
smiled
and
shook
her
head
again
sophistry
sophia
what
do
you
think
of
i
do
see
what
reason
you
have
to
be
anything
but
happy
what
have
i
to
make
me
so
sophia
was
silent
alice
laid
her
thin
hand
upon
hers
i
am
leaving
all
i
love
in
this
world
should
i
be
happy
if
i
were
not
going
to
somewhat
i
love
better
should
i
be
happy
if
i
had
no
secure
prospect
of
meeting
with
them
again
or
if
i
were
doubtful
of
my
reception
in
that
place
whither
i
hope
to
go
to
sophia
burst
into
tears
well
i
do
know
said
she
i
suppose
you
are
right
but
i
do
understand
it
alice
drew
her
face
down
to
hers
and
whispered
something
in
her
ear
undoubtedly
alice
had
much
around
as
well
as
within
her
to
make
a
declining
life
happy
vawse
and
miss
marshman
were
two
friends
and
nurses
not
to
be
surpassed
in
their
different
ways
margery
motherly
affection
her
zeal
and
her
skill
left
nothing
for
heart
to
wish
in
her
line
of
duty
and
all
that
affection
taste
and
kindness
which
abundant
means
could
supply
was
at
alice
command
still
her
greatest
comfort
was
ellen
her
constant
thoughtful
care
the
thousand
tender
attentions
from
the
roses
daily
gathered
for
her
table
to
the
chapters
she
read
and
the
hymns
she
sung
to
her
the
smile
that
often
covered
a
pang
the
pleasant
words
and
tone
that
many
a
time
came
from
a
sinking
heart
they
were
alice
daily
and
nightly
cordial
ellen
had
learned
in
more
than
one
school
affection
as
once
before
was
her
powerful
teacher
now
and
taught
her
well
sophia
openly
confessed
that
ellen
was
the
best
nurse
and
margery
when
nobody
heard
her
muttered
blessings
on
the
child
head
humphreys
came
in
often
to
see
his
daughter
but
never
stayed
long
it
was
plain
he
could
not
bear
it
it
might
have
been
difficult
too
for
alice
to
bear
but
she
wished
for
her
brother
she
reckoned
the
time
from
chauncey
letter
to
that
when
he
might
be
looked
for
but
some
irregularities
in
the
course
of
the
made
it
impossible
to
count
with
certainty
upon
the
exact
time
of
his
arrival
meanwhile
her
failure
was
very
rapid
vawse
began
to
fear
he
would
not
arrive
in
time
the
weeks
of
june
ran
out
the
roses
all
but
a
few
late
kinds
blossomed
and
died
july
came
one
morning
when
ellen
went
into
her
room
alice
drew
her
close
to
her
and
said
you
remember
ellie
in
the
progress
when
christiana
and
her
companions
were
sent
to
go
over
the
river
i
think
the
messenger
has
come
for
me
you
must
cry
love
listen
this
is
the
token
he
seems
to
bring
me
have
loved
thee
with
an
everlasting
love
i
am
sure
of
it
ellie
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
so
do
cry
for
me
you
have
been
my
dear
comfort
my
blessing
we
shall
love
each
other
in
heaven
ellie
alice
kissed
her
earnestly
several
times
and
then
ellen
escaped
from
her
arms
and
fled
away
it
was
long
before
she
could
come
back
again
but
she
came
at
last
and
went
on
through
all
that
day
as
she
had
done
for
weeks
before
the
day
seemed
long
for
every
member
of
the
family
was
on
the
watch
for
john
arrival
and
it
was
thought
his
sister
would
not
live
to
see
another
it
wore
away
hour
after
hour
passed
without
his
coming
and
the
night
fell
alice
showed
no
impatience
but
she
evidently
wished
and
watched
for
him
and
ellen
whose
affection
read
her
face
and
knew
what
to
make
of
the
look
at
the
opening
door
the
eye
turned
towards
the
window
the
attitude
of
listening
grew
feverish
with
her
intense
desire
that
she
should
be
gratified
from
motives
of
convenience
alice
had
moved
upstairs
to
a
room
that
john
generally
occupied
when
he
was
at
home
directly
over
the
and
with
pleasant
windows
towards
the
east
chauncey
miss
sophia
and
vawse
were
all
there
alice
was
lying
quietly
on
the
bed
and
seemed
to
be
dozing
but
ellen
noticed
after
lights
were
brought
that
every
now
and
then
she
opened
her
eyes
and
gave
an
inquiring
look
round
the
room
ellen
could
not
bear
it
slipping
softly
out
she
went
downstairs
and
seated
herself
on
the
threshold
of
the
glass
door
as
if
by
watching
there
she
could
be
any
nearer
the
knowledge
of
what
she
wished
for
it
was
a
perfectly
still
summer
night
the
moon
shone
brightly
on
the
little
lawn
and
poured
its
rays
over
ellen
just
as
it
had
done
one
evening
near
a
year
ago
ellen
thoughts
went
back
to
it
how
like
and
how
unlike
all
around
was
just
the
same
as
it
had
been
then
the
cool
moonlight
upon
the
distant
fields
the
trees
in
the
gap
lit
up
as
then
the
lawn
a
flood
of
brightness
but
there
was
no
happy
party
gathered
there
now
they
were
scattered
one
was
away
one
a
sorrowful
watcher
alone
in
the
moonlight
one
waiting
to
be
gone
where
there
is
no
need
of
moon
or
stars
for
evermore
ellen
almost
wondered
they
could
shine
so
bright
upon
those
that
had
no
heart
to
rejoice
in
them
she
thought
they
looked
down
coldly
and
unfeelingly
upon
her
distress
she
remembered
the
none
was
heard
near
or
far
she
was
glad
of
it
it
would
have
been
too
much
and
there
were
no
fluttering
leaves
the
air
was
absolutely
still
ellen
looked
up
again
at
the
moon
and
stars
they
shone
calmly
on
despite
the
reproaches
she
cast
upon
them
and
as
she
still
gazed
up
towards
them
in
their
purity
and
steadfastness
other
thoughts
began
to
come
into
her
head
of
that
which
was
more
pure
still
and
more
steadfast
how
long
they
have
been
shining
thought
ellen
going
on
just
the
same
from
night
to
night
and
from
year
to
year
as
if
they
never
would
come
to
an
end
but
they
come
to
an
end
the
time
come
when
they
stop
shining
bright
as
they
are
and
then
when
all
they
are
swept
away
then
heaven
will
be
only
begun
that
will
never
end
never
and
in
a
few
years
we
who
were
so
happy
a
year
ago
and
are
so
sorry
now
shall
be
all
glad
together
there
this
will
be
all
over
and
then
as
she
looked
and
the
tears
sprang
to
her
thoughts
a
favourite
hymn
of
alice
came
to
her
remembrance
ye
stars
are
but
the
shining
dust
of
my
divine
abode
the
pavements
of
those
heavenly
courts
where
i
shall
see
my
god
the
father
of
eternal
lights
shall
there
his
beams
display
and
not
one
moment
darkness
mix
with
that
unvaried
day
one
moment
darkness
oh
thought
little
ellen
there
are
a
great
many
here
still
gazing
up
at
the
bright
calm
heavens
while
the
tears
ran
fast
down
her
face
and
fell
into
her
lap
there
came
trooping
through
ellen
mind
many
of
those
words
she
had
been
in
the
habit
of
reading
to
her
mother
and
alice
and
which
she
knew
and
loved
so
well
and
there
shall
be
no
night
there
and
they
need
no
candle
neither
light
of
the
sun
for
the
lord
god
giveth
them
light
and
they
shall
reign
for
ever
and
ever
and
there
shall
be
no
more
curse
but
the
throne
of
god
and
of
the
lamb
shall
be
in
it
and
his
servants
shall
serve
him
and
they
shall
see
his
face
and
his
name
shall
be
in
their
foreheads
and
god
shall
wipe
away
all
tears
from
their
eyes
and
there
shall
be
no
more
death
neither
sorrow
nor
crying
neither
shall
there
be
any
more
pain
for
the
former
things
have
passed
away
and
if
i
go
and
prepare
a
place
for
you
i
will
come
again
and
receive
you
unto
myself
that
where
i
am
there
ye
may
be
also
while
ellen
was
yet
going
over
and
over
these
precious
things
with
a
strong
sense
of
their
preciousness
in
all
her
throbbing
grief
there
came
to
her
ear
through
the
perfect
stillness
of
the
night
the
faint
sound
of
horse
feet
nearer
and
nearer
every
second
it
came
with
a
mingled
pang
of
pain
and
pleasure
both
very
acute
she
rose
instantly
to
her
feet
and
stood
pressing
her
hand
to
her
heart
while
the
beat
of
hoofs
grew
louder
and
louder
until
it
ceased
at
the
very
door
the
minutes
were
few
but
they
were
moments
of
intense
bitterness
the
tired
horse
stooped
his
head
as
the
rider
flung
himself
from
the
saddle
and
came
to
the
door
where
ellen
stood
fixed
a
look
asked
and
a
look
answered
the
question
that
lips
could
not
speak
ellen
only
pointed
the
way
and
uttered
the
words
up
stairs
and
john
rushed
thither
he
checked
himself
however
at
the
door
of
the
room
and
opened
it
and
went
in
as
calmly
as
if
he
had
but
come
from
a
walk
but
his
caution
was
very
needless
alice
knew
his
step
she
knew
horse
too
well
she
had
raised
herself
up
and
stretched
out
both
arms
towards
him
before
he
entered
in
another
moment
they
were
round
his
neck
and
she
was
supported
in
his
there
was
a
long
long
silence
are
you
happy
alice
whispered
her
brother
perfectly
this
was
all
i
wanted
kiss
me
dear
john
as
he
did
so
again
and
again
she
felt
his
tears
on
her
cheek
and
put
up
her
hands
to
his
face
to
wipe
them
away
kissed
him
then
and
then
once
again
laid
her
head
on
his
breast
they
remained
so
a
little
while
without
stirring
except
that
some
whispers
were
exchanged
too
low
for
others
to
hear
and
once
more
she
raised
her
face
to
kiss
him
a
few
minutes
after
those
who
could
look
saw
his
colour
change
he
felt
the
arms
unclasp
their
hold
and
as
he
laid
her
gently
back
on
the
pillow
they
fell
languidly
down
the
will
and
the
power
that
had
sustained
them
were
gone
was
gone
but
the
departing
spirit
had
left
a
ray
of
brightness
on
its
earthly
house
there
was
a
half
smile
on
the
sweet
face
of
most
entire
peace
and
satisfaction
her
brother
looked
for
a
moment
closed
the
eyes
kissed
once
and
again
the
sweet
lips
and
left
the
room
ellen
saw
him
no
more
that
night
nor
knew
how
he
passed
it
for
her
wearied
with
grief
and
excitement
it
was
spent
in
long
heavy
slumber
from
the
pitch
to
which
her
spirits
had
been
wrought
by
care
sorrow
and
they
now
suddenly
and
completely
sank
down
naturally
and
happily
she
lost
all
sense
of
trouble
in
sleep
when
sleep
at
last
left
her
and
she
stole
downstairs
into
the
in
the
morning
it
was
rather
early
nobody
was
stirring
about
the
house
but
herself
it
seemed
deserted
the
old
looked
empty
and
forlorn
the
stillness
was
oppressive
ellen
could
not
bear
it
softly
opening
the
glass
door
she
went
out
upon
the
lawn
where
everything
was
sparkling
in
the
early
freshness
of
the
summer
morning
how
could
it
look
so
pleasant
without
when
all
pleasantness
was
gone
within
it
pressed
upon
ellen
heart
with
a
restless
feeling
of
pain
she
went
on
round
the
corner
of
the
house
and
paced
slowly
along
the
road
till
she
came
to
the
footpath
that
led
up
to
the
place
on
the
mountain
john
had
called
the
bridge
of
the
nose
ellen
took
that
path
often
travelled
and
much
loved
by
her
and
slowly
with
tears
made
her
way
up
over
moss
wet
with
the
dew
and
the
stones
and
rocks
with
which
the
rough
way
was
strewn
she
passed
the
place
where
alice
at
first
found
her
she
remembered
it
well
there
was
the
very
stone
beside
which
they
had
kneeled
together
and
where
folded
hands
were
laid
ellen
knelt
down
beside
it
again
and
for
a
moment
laid
her
cheek
to
the
cold
stone
while
her
arms
embraced
it
and
a
second
time
it
was
watered
with
tears
she
rose
up
again
quickly
and
went
on
her
way
toiling
up
the
steep
path
beyond
till
she
turned
the
edge
of
the
mountain
and
stood
on
the
old
place
where
she
and
alice
that
evening
had
watched
the
setting
sun
many
a
setting
sun
they
had
watched
from
thence
it
had
been
a
favourite
pleasure
of
them
both
to
run
up
there
for
a
few
minutes
before
or
after
tea
and
see
the
sun
go
down
at
the
far
end
of
the
long
valley
it
seemed
to
ellen
one
of
haunts
she
missed
her
there
and
the
thought
went
keenly
home
that
there
she
would
come
with
her
no
more
she
sat
down
on
the
stone
she
called
her
own
and
leaning
her
head
on
alice
which
was
close
by
she
wept
bitterly
yet
not
very
long
she
was
too
tired
and
subdued
for
bitter
weeping
she
raised
her
head
again
and
wiping
away
her
tears
looked
abroad
over
the
beautiful
landscape
never
more
beautiful
than
then
the
early
sun
filled
the
valley
with
patches
of
light
and
shade
the
sides
and
tops
of
the
hills
looking
towards
the
east
were
bright
with
the
cool
brightness
of
the
morning
beyond
and
between
them
deep
shadows
lay
the
sun
could
not
yet
look
at
that
side
of
the
mountain
where
ellen
sat
nor
at
the
long
reach
of
ground
it
screened
from
his
view
stretching
from
the
mountain
foot
to
the
other
end
of
the
valley
but
to
the
left
between
that
and
the
cat
back
the
rays
of
the
sun
streamed
through
touching
the
houses
of
the
village
showing
the
lake
and
making
every
tree
and
barn
and
clump
of
wood
in
the
distance
stand
out
in
bright
relief
deliciously
cool
both
the
air
and
the
light
though
a
warm
day
was
promised
the
night
had
swept
away
all
the
heat
of
yesterday
now
the
air
was
fresh
with
the
dew
and
sweet
from
hayfield
and
meadow
and
the
birds
were
singing
like
mad
all
around
there
was
no
answering
echo
in
the
little
human
heart
that
looked
and
listened
ellen
loved
all
these
things
too
well
not
to
notice
them
even
now
she
felt
their
full
beauty
but
she
felt
it
sadly
will
look
at
it
no
more
she
said
to
herself
but
instantly
came
an
answer
to
her
thought
behold
i
create
new
heavens
and
a
new
earth
and
the
former
shall
not
be
remembered
nor
come
into
mind
thy
sun
shall
no
more
go
down
neither
shall
thy
moon
withdraw
itself
for
the
lord
shall
be
thine
everlasting
light
and
the
days
of
thy
mourning
shall
be
ended
she
is
there
now
thought
ellen
she
is
happy
why
should
i
be
sorry
for
her
i
am
not
but
oh
i
must
be
sorry
for
myself
oh
alice
dear
alice
she
wept
but
then
again
came
sweeping
over
her
mind
the
words
with
which
she
was
so
familiar
the
days
of
thy
mourning
shall
be
ended
and
again
with
her
regret
mingled
the
consciousness
that
it
must
be
for
herself
alone
and
for
herself
can
i
not
trust
him
whom
she
trusted
she
thought
somewhat
soothed
and
more
calm
she
sat
still
looking
down
into
the
brightening
valley
or
off
to
the
hills
that
stretched
away
on
either
hand
of
it
when
up
through
the
still
air
the
sound
of
the
little
church
bell
came
to
her
ear
it
rang
for
a
minute
and
then
stopped
it
crossed
ellen
mind
to
wonder
what
it
could
be
ringing
for
at
that
time
of
day
but
she
went
back
to
her
musings
and
had
entirely
forgotten
it
when
again
clear
and
full
through
the
stillness
the
sound
came
pealing
up
one
two
ellen
knew
now
it
went
through
her
very
heart
it
is
the
custom
in
the
country
to
toll
the
church
bell
upon
occasions
of
death
of
any
one
in
the
township
or
parish
a
few
strokes
are
rung
by
way
of
drawing
attention
these
are
followed
after
a
little
pause
by
a
single
one
if
the
knell
is
for
a
man
or
two
for
a
woman
then
another
short
pause
then
follows
the
number
of
years
the
person
has
lived
told
in
short
rather
slow
strokes
as
one
would
count
them
up
after
pausing
once
more
the
tolling
begins
and
is
kept
up
for
some
time
the
strokes
following
in
slow
and
sad
succession
each
one
being
permitted
to
die
quite
away
before
another
breaks
upon
the
ear
ellen
had
been
told
of
this
custom
but
habit
had
never
made
it
familiar
only
once
she
had
happened
to
hear
this
notice
of
death
given
out
and
that
was
long
ago
the
bell
could
not
be
heard
at
miss
fortune
house
it
came
upon
her
now
with
all
the
force
of
novelty
and
surprise
as
the
number
of
the
years
of
alice
life
was
sadly
told
out
every
stroke
was
to
her
as
if
it
fell
upon
a
raw
nerve
ellen
hid
her
face
in
her
lap
and
tried
to
keep
from
counting
but
she
could
not
and
as
the
tremulous
sound
of
the
last
of
the
died
away
upon
the
air
she
was
shuddering
from
head
to
foot
a
burst
of
tears
relieved
her
when
the
sound
ceased
just
then
a
voice
close
beside
her
said
low
as
if
the
speaker
might
not
trust
its
higher
tones
i
will
lift
up
mine
eyes
unto
the
hills
from
whence
cometh
my
help
how
differently
sound
struck
upon
ellen
ear
with
an
indescribable
air
of
mingled
tenderness
weariness
and
sorrow
she
slowly
rose
from
her
seat
and
put
both
her
arms
round
the
neck
neither
said
a
word
but
to
ellen
the
arm
that
held
her
was
more
than
all
words
it
was
the
dividing
line
between
her
and
the
world
on
this
side
everything
on
that
side
nothing
no
word
was
spoken
for
many
minutes
my
dear
ellen
said
her
brother
softly
how
came
you
here
i
do
know
whispered
ellen
there
was
nobody
there
i
stay
in
the
house
shall
we
go
home
now
oh
yes
whenever
you
please
but
neither
moved
yet
ellen
had
raised
her
head
she
still
stood
with
her
arm
upon
her
brother
shoulder
the
eyes
of
both
were
on
the
scene
before
them
the
thoughts
of
neither
he
presently
spoke
again
let
us
try
to
love
our
god
better
ellie
the
less
we
have
left
to
love
in
this
world
that
is
his
meaning
let
sorrow
but
bring
us
closer
to
him
dear
alice
is
well
she
is
well
and
if
we
are
made
to
suffer
we
know
and
we
love
the
hand
that
has
done
it
do
we
not
ellie
ellen
put
her
hands
to
her
face
she
thought
her
heart
would
break
he
gently
drew
her
to
a
seat
on
the
stone
beside
him
and
still
keeping
his
arm
round
her
slowly
and
soothingly
went
on
think
that
she
is
happy
think
that
she
is
safe
think
that
she
is
with
that
blessed
one
whose
face
we
seek
at
a
distance
satisfied
with
his
likeness
instead
of
wearily
struggling
with
sin
think
that
sweetly
and
easily
she
has
got
home
and
it
is
our
home
too
we
must
weep
because
we
are
left
alone
but
for
her
heard
a
voice
from
heaven
saying
unto
me
blessed
are
the
dead
that
die
in
the
lord
as
he
spoke
in
low
and
sweet
tones
ellen
tears
calmed
and
stopped
but
she
still
kept
her
hands
to
her
face
shall
we
go
home
ellie
said
her
brother
after
another
silence
she
rose
up
instantly
and
said
yes
but
he
held
her
still
and
looking
for
a
moment
at
the
tokens
of
watching
and
grief
and
care
in
her
countenance
he
gently
kissed
the
pale
little
face
adding
a
word
of
endearment
which
almost
broke
ellen
heart
again
then
taking
her
hand
they
went
down
the
mountain
together
chapter
xliii
i
have
seen
angels
by
the
sick
one
pillow
there
was
the
soft
tone
and
the
soundless
tread
where
smitten
hearts
were
drooping
like
the
willow
they
stood
between
the
living
and
the
dead
unknown
the
whole
marshman
family
arrived
from
ventnor
some
to
see
alice
lovely
remains
and
all
to
follow
them
to
the
grave
the
parsonage
could
not
hold
so
many
the
two
marshmans
therefore
with
major
and
gillespie
made
their
quarters
at
thirlwall
hands
were
full
enough
with
those
that
were
left
in
the
afternoon
however
she
found
time
for
a
visit
to
the
room
room
she
was
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
gazing
on
the
sweet
face
she
loved
so
dearly
when
chauncey
and
vawse
came
up
for
the
same
purpose
all
three
stood
some
time
in
silence
the
bed
was
strewn
with
flowers
somewhat
singularly
disposed
upon
the
pillow
and
upon
and
about
the
hands
which
were
folded
on
the
breast
were
scattered
some
of
the
rich
late
roses
roses
and
rosebuds
strewn
with
beautiful
and
profuse
carelessness
a
single
stem
of
white
lilies
lay
on
the
side
of
the
bed
the
rest
of
the
flowers
a
large
quantity
covered
the
feet
seeming
to
have
been
flung
there
without
any
attempt
at
arrangement
they
were
of
various
kinds
chosen
however
with
exquisite
taste
and
feeling
beside
the
roses
there
were
none
that
were
not
either
white
or
distinguished
for
their
fragrance
the
delicate
white
verbena
the
pure
feverfew
mignonette
sweet
geranium
white
myrtle
the
heliotrope
were
mingled
with
the
late
blossoming
damask
and
purple
roses
no
yellow
flowers
no
purple
except
those
mentioned
even
the
flaunting
petunia
though
white
had
been
left
out
by
the
nice
hand
that
had
culled
them
but
the
arranging
of
these
beauties
seemed
to
have
been
little
more
than
attempted
though
indeed
it
might
be
questioned
whether
the
finest
art
could
have
bettered
the
effect
of
what
the
overtasked
hand
of
affection
had
left
half
done
chauncey
however
after
a
while
began
slowly
to
take
a
flower
or
two
from
the
foot
and
place
them
on
other
parts
of
the
bed
will
chauncey
pardon
my
being
so
bold
said
margery
then
who
had
looked
on
with
no
pleasure
while
this
was
doing
but
if
she
had
seen
when
those
flowers
were
put
there
it
would
be
her
wish
i
am
sure
it
would
be
her
wish
to
stir
one
of
them
chauncey
hand
which
was
stretched
out
for
a
fourth
drew
back
why
who
put
them
there
she
asked
miss
ellen
where
is
ellen
i
think
she
is
sleeping
poor
child
she
the
most
wearied
of
us
all
with
sorrow
and
watching
said
margery
weeping
you
saw
her
bring
them
up
did
you
i
saw
her
oh
will
i
ever
forget
it
as
long
as
i
live
why
said
chauncey
gently
it
a
thing
one
should
have
seen
to
understand
i
do
know
as
i
can
tell
it
well
seeing
however
that
chauncey
still
looked
her
wish
margery
went
on
half
under
her
breath
why
the
way
it
was
i
had
come
up
to
get
some
linen
out
of
the
closet
for
i
had
watched
my
time
chauncey
sees
i
was
afeared
of
finding
john
here
and
i
knew
that
he
was
lying
down
just
then
so
lying
down
was
he
said
vawse
i
did
not
know
he
had
taken
any
rest
it
was
very
little
he
took
indeed
though
there
was
need
enough
i
am
sure
he
had
been
up
with
his
father
the
blessed
night
and
then
the
first
thing
this
morning
he
was
away
after
miss
ellen
poor
child
wherever
she
had
betaken
herself
to
i
happened
to
see
her
before
anybody
was
out
going
round
the
corner
of
the
house
and
so
i
knew
when
he
asked
me
for
her
was
she
going
after
flowers
said
chauncey
oh
no
it
was
a
long
time
after
it
was
this
morning
some
time
i
had
come
up
to
the
linen
closet
knowing
john
was
in
his
room
and
i
thought
i
was
safe
and
i
had
just
taken
two
or
three
pieces
on
my
arm
you
know
when
somehow
i
forgot
myself
and
forgot
what
i
had
come
for
and
leaving
what
i
should
ha
been
adoing
i
was
standing
there
looking
out
this
way
at
the
dear
features
i
never
thought
to
see
in
death
and
i
had
entirely
forgotten
what
i
was
there
for
when
i
heard
miss
ellen
little
footstep
coming
softly
upstairs
i
want
her
to
catch
sight
of
me
just
then
so
i
had
just
drew
myself
back
a
bit
so
as
i
could
see
her
without
her
seeing
me
back
in
the
closet
where
i
was
but
it
had
like
to
have
got
the
better
of
me
entirely
when
i
see
her
come
in
with
a
lap
full
of
them
flowers
and
looking
so
as
she
did
too
but
with
much
trouble
i
kept
quiet
she
went
up
and
stood
by
the
side
of
the
bed
just
where
chauncey
is
standing
with
her
sweet
sad
little
face
it
the
hardest
thing
to
see
a
child
face
look
so
and
the
flowers
all
gathered
up
in
her
frock
it
was
odd
to
see
her
she
did
cry
not
at
all
only
once
i
saw
her
brow
wrinkle
but
it
seemed
as
if
she
had
a
mind
not
to
for
she
put
her
hand
up
to
her
face
and
held
it
a
little
and
then
she
began
to
take
out
the
flowers
one
by
one
and
she
lay
a
rose
here
and
a
there
and
so
and
then
she
went
round
to
the
other
side
and
laid
the
lilies
and
two
or
three
more
roses
there
on
the
pillow
but
i
could
see
all
the
while
it
was
getting
too
much
for
her
i
see
very
soon
she
would
get
through
she
just
placed
two
or
three
more
and
one
rose
there
in
that
hand
and
that
was
the
last
i
could
see
it
working
in
her
face
she
turned
as
pale
as
her
lilies
all
at
once
and
just
tossed
up
all
the
flowers
out
of
her
frock
on
the
there
that
just
as
they
fell
and
down
she
went
on
her
knees
and
her
face
in
her
hands
on
the
side
of
the
bed
i
thought
no
more
about
my
linen
said
margery
weeping
i
could
do
anything
but
look
at
that
child
kneeling
there
and
her
flowers
and
all
beside
her
she
used
to
call
her
sister
and
that
could
be
a
sister
to
her
no
more
and
she
without
a
sister
now
to
be
sure
poor
child
she
has
a
brother
unless
i
am
mistaken
said
chauncey
when
she
could
speak
and
that
just
what
i
was
going
to
tell
you
she
had
been
there
five
or
ten
minutes
without
moving
or
more
i
am
sure
i
do
know
how
long
it
was
i
did
think
how
time
went
when
the
first
thing
i
knew
i
heard
another
step
and
john
came
in
i
thought
and
expected
he
was
taking
some
sleep
but
i
suppose
said
margery
sighing
he
could
rest
i
knew
his
step
and
just
drew
myself
back
further
he
came
just
where
you
are
and
stood
with
his
arms
folded
a
long
time
looking
i
do
know
how
miss
ellen
did
hear
him
come
in
but
however
she
did
and
they
were
both
as
still
as
death
one
on
one
side
and
the
other
on
the
other
side
and
i
wondered
he
did
see
her
but
her
white
dress
and
all
and
i
suppose
he
had
no
thought
but
for
one
thing
i
knew
the
first
minute
he
did
see
her
when
he
looked
over
and
spied
her
on
the
other
side
of
the
bed
i
see
his
colour
change
and
then
his
mouth
took
the
look
it
always
did
whenever
he
sets
himself
to
do
anything
he
stood
a
minute
and
then
he
went
round
and
knelt
down
beside
of
her
and
softly
took
away
one
of
her
hands
from
under
her
face
and
held
it
in
both
of
his
own
and
then
he
made
such
a
prayer
oh
said
margery
her
tears
falling
fast
at
the
recollection
i
never
heard
the
like
i
never
did
he
gave
thanks
for
miss
alice
and
he
had
reason
enough
to
be
sure
and
for
himself
and
miss
ellen
i
wondered
to
hear
him
and
he
prayed
for
them
too
and
others
and
oh
i
thought
i
could
stand
and
hear
him
and
i
was
afeared
to
breathe
the
whole
time
lest
he
would
know
i
was
there
it
was
the
beautifullest
prayer
i
did
ever
hear
or
ever
shall
however
and
how
did
ellen
behave
said
chauncey
when
she
could
speak
she
did
stir
nor
make
the
least
motion
nor
sound
till
he
had
done
and
spoke
to
her
they
stood
a
little
while
then
and
john
put
the
rest
of
the
flowers
up
there
round
her
hands
and
the
pillow
miss
ellen
had
put
more
than
i
noticed
how
he
kept
hold
of
miss
ellen
hand
all
the
time
i
heard
her
begin
to
tell
him
how
she
finish
the
flowers
and
he
told
her
saw
it
all
ellie
he
said
and
he
said
did
want
finishing
i
wondered
how
he
should
see
it
but
i
suppose
he
did
however
understood
it
very
well
they
went
away
downstairs
after
that
he
is
beautifully
changed
said
vawse
i
do
know
said
margery
i
heard
that
said
afore
but
i
ca
say
as
i
ever
could
see
it
he
always
was
the
same
to
me
always
the
honourablest
truest
noblest
my
husband
says
he
was
a
bit
fiery
but
i
never
could
tell
that
the
one
temper
was
sweeter
than
the
other
only
everybody
always
did
whatever
john
wanted
to
be
sure
but
he
was
the
perfectest
gentleman
always
i
have
not
seen
either
john
or
ellen
since
my
mother
came
said
chauncey
no
said
margery
they
were
out
reading
under
the
trees
for
a
long
time
and
miss
ellen
came
in
the
kitchen
way
a
little
while
ago
and
went
to
lie
down
how
is
mr
humphreys
oh
i
ca
tell
you
he
is
worse
than
any
one
knows
of
i
am
afraid
unless
john
you
will
not
see
him
he
has
not
been
here
once
nor
do
mean
to
i
think
it
will
go
hard
with
my
poor
master
i
am
afraid
said
margery
weeping
dear
miss
alice
said
miss
ellen
was
to
take
her
place
but
it
would
want
an
angel
to
do
that
ellen
will
do
a
great
deal
said
vawse
humphreys
loves
her
well
now
i
know
so
do
i
i
am
sure
and
so
does
every
one
but
still
margery
broke
off
her
sentence
and
sorrowfully
went
downstairs
chauncey
moved
no
more
flowers
late
in
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
margery
came
softly
into
room
miss
ellen
dear
you
are
awake
are
you
yes
margery
said
ellen
sitting
up
on
the
bed
come
in
what
is
it
i
came
to
ask
miss
ellen
if
she
do
me
a
great
favour
there
a
strange
gentleman
come
and
nobody
has
seen
him
yet
and
it
do
seem
right
he
has
been
here
this
some
time
have
you
told
mr
john
no
miss
ellen
he
in
the
library
with
my
master
and
somehow
i
durs
go
to
the
door
mayhap
they
would
be
best
pleased
miss
ellen
mind
telling
john
of
the
gentleman
being
here
ellen
would
mind
it
very
much
there
was
no
doubt
of
that
margery
could
hardly
have
asked
her
to
put
a
greater
force
upon
herself
she
did
not
say
so
you
are
sure
he
is
there
margery
i
am
quite
sure
miss
ellen
i
am
very
sorry
to
disturb
you
but
if
you
would
mind
i
am
ashamed
to
have
the
gentleman
left
to
himself
so
long
i
do
it
margery
she
got
up
slipped
on
her
shoes
and
mechanically
smoothing
her
hair
set
off
to
the
library
on
the
way
she
almost
repented
her
willingness
to
oblige
margery
the
errand
was
marvellously
disagreeable
to
her
she
had
never
gone
to
that
room
except
with
alice
never
entered
it
uninvited
she
could
hardly
make
up
her
mind
to
knock
at
the
door
but
she
had
promised
it
must
be
done
the
first
fearful
tap
was
too
light
to
rouse
any
mortal
ears
at
the
second
though
not
much
better
she
heard
some
one
move
and
john
opened
the
door
without
waiting
to
hear
her
speak
he
immediately
drew
her
in
very
unwillingly
on
her
part
and
led
her
silently
up
to
his
father
the
old
gentleman
was
sitting
in
his
great
with
a
book
open
at
his
side
he
turned
from
it
as
she
came
up
took
her
hand
in
his
and
held
it
for
a
few
moments
without
speaking
ellen
dared
not
raise
her
eyes
my
little
girl
said
he
very
gravely
though
not
without
a
tone
of
kindness
too
are
you
coming
here
to
cheer
my
loneliness
ellen
in
vain
struggled
to
speak
an
articulate
word
it
was
impossible
she
suddenly
stooped
down
and
touched
her
lips
to
the
hand
that
lay
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
he
put
the
hand
tenderly
upon
her
head
god
bless
you
said
he
abundantly
for
all
the
love
you
showed
come
if
you
will
and
be
as
far
as
a
withered
heart
will
let
you
all
that
she
wished
all
is
yours
except
what
will
be
buried
with
her
ellen
was
awed
and
pained
very
much
not
because
the
words
and
manner
were
sad
and
solemn
it
was
the
that
distressed
her
there
was
no
tearfulness
in
it
it
trembled
a
little
it
seemed
to
come
indeed
from
a
withered
heart
she
shook
with
the
effort
she
made
to
control
herself
john
asked
her
presently
what
she
had
come
for
a
gentleman
said
ellen
there
a
gentleman
a
stranger
he
went
immediately
out
to
see
him
leaving
her
standing
there
ellen
did
not
know
whether
to
go
too
or
stay
she
thought
from
his
not
taking
her
with
him
he
wished
her
to
stay
she
stood
doubtfully
presently
she
heard
steps
coming
back
along
the
hall
steps
of
two
persons
the
door
opened
and
the
strange
gentleman
came
in
no
stranger
to
ellen
she
knew
him
in
a
moment
it
was
her
old
friend
her
friend
of
the
boat
george
marshman
humphreys
rose
up
to
meet
him
and
the
two
gentlemen
shook
hands
in
silence
ellen
had
at
first
shrunk
out
of
the
way
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
and
now
when
she
saw
an
opportunity
she
was
going
to
make
her
escape
but
john
gently
detained
her
and
she
stood
still
by
his
side
though
with
a
kind
of
feeling
that
it
was
not
there
the
best
place
or
time
for
her
old
friend
to
recognise
her
he
was
sitting
by
humphreys
and
for
the
present
quite
occupied
with
him
ellen
thought
nothing
of
what
they
were
saying
with
eyes
eagerly
fixed
upon
marshman
she
was
reading
memory
long
story
over
again
the
same
pleasant
look
and
kind
tone
that
she
remembered
so
well
came
to
comfort
her
in
her
first
sorrow
the
old
way
of
speaking
and
even
of
moving
an
arm
or
hand
the
familiar
figure
and
face
how
they
took
thoughts
back
to
the
deck
of
the
steamboat
the
hymns
the
talks
the
love
and
kindness
that
led
and
persuaded
her
so
faithfully
and
effectually
to
do
her
duty
it
was
all
present
again
and
ellen
gazed
at
him
as
at
a
picture
of
the
past
forgetting
for
the
moment
everything
else
the
same
love
and
kindness
were
endeavouring
now
to
say
something
for
humphreys
relief
it
was
a
hard
task
the
old
gentleman
heard
and
answered
for
the
most
part
briefly
but
so
as
to
show
that
his
friend
laboured
in
vain
the
bitterness
and
hardness
of
grief
were
unallayed
yet
it
was
not
till
john
made
some
slight
remark
that
marshman
turned
his
head
that
way
he
looked
for
a
moment
in
some
surprise
and
then
said
his
countenance
lightening
is
that
ellen
montgomery
ellen
sprang
across
at
that
word
to
take
his
outstretched
hand
but
as
she
felt
the
grasp
of
it
and
met
the
whole
look
the
thought
of
which
she
had
treasured
up
for
years
it
was
too
much
back
as
in
a
flood
to
her
heart
seemed
to
come
at
once
all
the
thoughts
and
feelings
of
the
time
since
then
the
difference
of
this
meeting
from
the
joyful
one
she
had
so
often
pictured
to
herself
the
sorrow
of
that
time
mixed
with
the
sorrow
now
and
the
sense
that
the
very
hand
that
had
wiped
those
first
tears
away
was
the
one
now
laid
in
the
dust
by
death
all
thronged
on
her
heart
at
once
and
it
was
too
much
she
had
scarce
touched
marshman
hand
when
she
hastily
withdrew
her
own
and
gave
way
to
an
overwhelming
burst
of
sorrow
it
was
infectious
there
was
such
an
utter
absence
of
all
bitterness
or
hardness
in
the
tone
of
this
grief
there
was
so
touching
an
expression
of
submission
mingled
with
it
that
even
humphreys
was
overcome
ellen
was
not
the
only
subdued
weeper
there
not
the
only
one
whose
tears
came
from
a
heart
for
a
few
minutes
the
silence
of
stifled
sobs
was
in
the
room
till
ellen
recovered
enough
to
make
her
escape
and
then
the
colour
of
sorrow
was
lightened
in
one
breast
at
least
brother
said
humphreys
i
can
hear
you
now
better
than
i
could
a
little
while
ago
i
had
almost
forgotten
that
god
is
good
in
the
darkness
i
see
it
now
that
child
has
given
me
a
lesson
ellen
did
not
know
what
had
passed
around
her
nor
what
had
followed
her
quitting
the
room
but
she
thought
when
john
came
to
the
he
looked
relieved
if
his
general
kindness
and
tenderness
of
manner
towards
herself
have
been
greater
than
usual
she
might
have
thought
it
was
that
night
but
she
only
thought
he
felt
better
marshman
was
not
permitted
to
leave
the
house
he
was
a
great
comfort
to
everybody
not
himself
overburdened
with
sorrow
he
was
able
to
make
that
effort
for
the
good
of
the
rest
which
no
one
yet
had
been
equal
to
the
whole
family
except
humphreys
were
gathered
together
at
this
time
and
his
grave
cheerful
unceasing
kindness
made
that
by
far
the
most
comfortable
meal
that
had
been
taken
it
was
exceeding
grateful
to
ellen
to
see
and
hear
him
from
the
old
remembrance
as
well
as
the
present
effect
and
he
had
not
forgotten
his
old
kindness
for
her
she
saw
it
in
his
look
his
words
his
voice
shown
in
every
way
and
the
feeling
that
she
had
got
her
old
friend
again
and
should
never
lose
him
now
gave
her
more
deep
pleasure
than
anything
else
could
possibly
have
done
at
that
time
his
own
family
too
had
not
seen
him
in
a
long
time
so
his
presence
was
a
matter
of
general
satisfaction
later
in
the
evening
ellen
was
sitting
beside
him
on
the
sofa
looking
and
listening
he
was
like
a
piece
of
old
music
to
her
when
john
came
to
the
back
of
the
sofa
and
said
he
wanted
to
speak
to
her
she
went
with
him
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
ellie
said
he
in
a
low
voice
i
think
my
father
would
like
to
hear
you
sing
a
hymn
do
you
think
you
could
ellen
looked
up
with
a
peculiar
mixture
of
uncertainty
and
resolution
in
her
countenance
and
said
yes
not
if
it
will
pain
you
too
much
and
not
unless
you
think
you
can
surely
go
through
with
it
ellen
he
said
gently
no
said
ellen
i
will
try
will
it
not
give
you
too
much
pain
do
you
think
you
can
no
i
will
try
she
repeated
as
she
went
along
the
hall
she
said
and
resolved
to
herself
that
she
do
it
the
library
was
dark
coming
from
the
light
ellen
at
first
could
see
nothing
john
placed
her
in
a
chair
and
went
away
himself
to
a
little
distance
where
he
remained
perfectly
still
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
for
a
minute
and
prayed
for
strength
she
was
afraid
to
try
alice
and
her
brother
were
remarkable
for
beauty
of
voice
and
utterance
the
latter
ellen
had
in
part
caught
from
them
in
the
former
she
thought
herself
greatly
inferior
perhaps
she
underrated
herself
her
voice
though
not
indeed
powerful
was
low
and
sweet
and
very
clear
and
the
entire
simplicity
and
feeling
with
which
she
sang
hymns
was
more
effectual
than
any
higher
qualities
of
tone
and
compass
she
had
been
very
much
accustomed
to
sing
with
alice
who
excelled
in
beautiful
truth
and
simplicity
of
expression
listening
with
delight
as
she
had
often
done
and
often
joining
with
her
ellen
had
caught
something
of
her
manner
she
thought
nothing
of
all
this
now
she
had
a
trying
task
to
go
through
sing
then
and
there
and
what
should
she
sing
all
that
class
of
hymns
that
bore
directly
on
the
subject
of
their
sorrow
must
be
left
on
one
side
she
hardly
dared
think
of
them
instinctively
she
took
up
another
class
that
without
baring
the
wound
would
lay
the
balm
close
to
it
a
few
minutes
of
deep
stillness
were
in
the
dark
room
then
very
low
and
in
tones
that
trembled
a
little
rose
the
words
how
sweet
the
name
of
jesus
sounds
in
a
believer
ear
it
soothes
his
sorrows
heals
his
wounds
and
drives
away
his
fear
the
tremble
in
her
voice
ceased
as
she
went
on
it
makes
the
wounded
spirit
whole
and
calms
the
troubled
breast
is
manna
to
the
hungry
soul
and
to
the
weary
rest
by
him
my
prayers
acceptance
gain
although
with
sin
defiled
satan
accuses
me
in
vain
and
i
am
owned
a
child
weak
is
the
effort
of
my
heart
and
cold
my
warmest
thought
but
when
i
see
thee
as
thou
art
i
praise
thee
as
i
ought
till
then
i
would
thy
love
proclaim
with
every
breath
and
may
the
music
of
thy
name
refresh
my
soul
in
death
ellen
paused
a
minute
there
was
not
a
sound
to
be
heard
in
the
room
she
thought
of
the
hymn
loving
kindness
but
the
tune
and
the
spirit
of
the
words
was
too
lively
her
mother
favourite
is
my
happiness
below
but
ellen
could
not
venture
that
she
strove
to
forget
it
as
fast
as
possible
she
sang
clearly
and
sweetly
as
ever
now
hark
my
soul
it
is
the
lord
is
thy
saviour
hear
his
word
jesus
speaks
and
speaks
to
thee
poor
sinner
thou
me
delivered
thee
when
bound
and
when
bleeding
healed
thy
wound
sought
thee
wandering
set
thee
right
turned
thy
darkness
into
light
a
mother
tender
care
cease
toward
the
child
she
bare
yea
may
forgetful
be
yet
will
i
remember
thee
is
an
unchanging
love
higher
than
the
heights
above
deeper
than
the
depths
beneath
free
and
faithful
strong
as
death
shalt
see
my
glory
soon
when
the
work
of
life
is
done
partner
of
my
throne
shalt
be
say
poor
sinner
lovest
thou
me
lord
it
is
my
chief
complaint
that
my
love
is
weak
and
faint
yet
i
love
thee
and
adore
oh
for
grace
to
love
thee
more
ellen
task
was
no
longer
painful
but
most
delightful
she
hoped
she
was
doing
some
good
and
that
hope
enabled
her
after
the
first
trembling
beginning
to
go
on
without
any
difficulty
she
was
not
thinking
of
herself
it
was
very
well
she
could
not
see
the
effect
upon
her
auditors
through
the
dark
her
eyes
could
only
just
discern
a
dark
figure
stretched
upon
the
sofa
and
another
standing
by
the
mantelpiece
the
room
was
profoundly
still
except
when
she
was
singing
the
choice
of
hymns
gave
her
the
greatest
trouble
she
thought
of
jerusalem
my
happy
home
but
it
would
not
do
she
and
alice
had
too
often
sung
it
in
strains
of
joy
happily
came
to
her
mind
the
beautiful
how
firm
a
foundation
ye
saints
of
the
lord
she
went
through
all
the
seven
long
verses
still
when
ellen
paused
at
the
end
of
this
the
breathless
silence
seemed
to
invite
her
to
go
on
she
waited
a
minute
to
gather
breath
the
blessed
words
had
gone
down
into
her
very
heart
did
they
ever
seem
half
so
sweet
before
she
was
cheered
and
strengthened
and
thought
she
could
go
through
with
the
next
hymn
though
it
had
been
much
loved
and
often
used
both
by
her
mother
and
alice
jesus
lover
of
my
soul
let
me
to
thy
bosom
fly
while
the
billows
near
me
roll
while
the
tempest
still
is
nigh
hide
me
o
my
saviour
hide
till
the
storm
of
life
be
past
safe
into
the
haven
guide
o
receive
my
soul
at
last
other
refuge
have
i
none
hangs
my
helpless
soul
on
thee
leave
ah
leave
me
not
alone
still
support
and
comfort
me
all
my
trust
on
thee
is
stayed
all
my
help
from
thee
i
bring
cover
my
defenceless
head
beneath
the
shadow
of
thy
wing
thou
o
christ
art
all
i
want
more
than
all
in
thee
i
find
raise
the
fallen
cheer
the
faint
heal
the
sick
and
lead
the
blind
just
and
holy
is
thy
name
i
am
all
unrighteousness
vile
and
full
of
sin
i
am
thou
art
full
of
truth
and
grace
still
silence
silence
that
spoke
ellen
did
not
know
what
it
said
except
that
her
hearers
did
not
wish
her
to
stop
her
next
was
a
favourite
hymn
of
them
all
what
are
these
in
bright
array
ellen
had
allowed
her
thoughts
to
travel
too
far
along
with
the
words
for
in
the
last
lines
her
voice
was
unsteady
and
faint
she
was
fain
to
make
a
longer
pause
than
usual
to
recover
herself
but
in
vain
the
tender
nerve
was
touched
there
was
no
stilling
its
quivering
ellen
said
humphreys
then
after
a
few
minutes
she
rose
and
went
to
the
sofa
he
folded
her
close
to
his
breast
thank
you
my
child
he
said
presently
you
have
been
a
comfort
to
me
nothing
but
a
choir
of
angels
could
have
been
sweeter
as
ellen
went
away
back
through
the
hall
her
tears
almost
choked
her
but
for
all
that
there
was
a
strong
throb
of
pleasure
at
her
heart
i
have
been
a
comfort
to
him
she
repeated
oh
dear
alice
so
i
will
chapter

a
child
no
more
a
maiden
now
a
graceful
maiden
with
a
gentle
brow
a
cheek
tinged
lightly
and
a
eye
and
all
hearts
bless
her
as
she
passes
by
mary
howitt
the
whole
marshman
family
returned
to
ventnor
immediately
after
the
funeral
george
excepted
he
stayed
with
humphreys
over
the
sabbath
and
preached
for
him
and
much
to
every
one
pleasure
lingered
still
a
day
or
two
longer
then
he
was
obliged
to
leave
them
john
also
must
go
back
to
doncaster
for
a
few
weeks
he
would
not
be
able
to
get
home
again
before
the
early
part
of
august
for
the
month
between
and
as
much
longer
indeed
as
possible
marshman
wished
to
have
ellen
at
ventnor
assuring
her
that
it
was
to
be
her
home
always
whenever
she
chose
to
make
it
so
at
first
neither
marshman
nor
her
daughters
would
take
any
denial
and
old
marshman
was
fixed
upon
it
but
ellen
begged
with
tears
that
she
might
stay
at
home
and
begin
at
once
as
far
as
she
could
to
take
alice
place
her
kind
friends
insisted
that
it
would
do
her
harm
to
be
left
alone
for
so
long
at
such
a
season
humphreys
at
the
best
of
times
kept
very
much
to
himself
and
now
he
would
more
than
ever
she
would
be
very
lonely
but
how
lonely
will
be
if
i
go
away
said
ellen
i
ca
go
finding
that
her
heart
was
set
upon
it
and
that
it
would
be
a
real
grief
to
her
to
go
to
ventnor
john
at
last
joined
to
excuse
her
and
he
made
an
arrangement
with
vawse
instead
that
she
should
come
and
stay
with
ellen
at
the
parsonage
till
he
came
back
this
gave
ellen
great
satisfaction
and
her
kind
ventnor
friends
were
obliged
unwillingly
to
leave
her
the
first
few
days
after
john
departure
were
indeed
sad
days
very
sad
to
every
one
it
could
not
be
otherwise
ellen
drooped
miserably
she
had
however
the
best
possible
companion
in
her
old
swiss
friend
her
good
sense
her
steady
cheerfulness
her
firm
principle
were
always
awake
for
ellen
good
ever
ready
to
comfort
her
to
cheer
her
to
prevent
her
from
giving
undue
way
to
sorrow
to
urge
her
to
useful
exertion
affection
and
gratitude
to
the
living
and
the
dead
gave
powerful
aid
to
these
efforts
ellen
rose
up
in
the
morning
and
lay
down
at
night
with
the
present
pressing
wish
to
do
and
be
for
the
ease
and
comfort
of
her
adopted
father
and
brother
all
that
it
was
possible
for
her
very
soon
so
soon
as
she
could
rouse
herself
to
anything
she
began
to
turn
over
in
her
mind
all
manner
of
ways
and
means
for
this
end
and
in
general
whatever
alice
would
have
wished
what
john
did
wish
was
law
to
her
margery
said
ellen
one
day
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
all
the
things
alice
used
to
do
so
that
i
may
begin
to
do
them
you
know
as
soon
as
i
can
what
things
miss
ellen
i
mean
the
things
she
used
to
do
about
the
house
or
to
help
you
do
you
know
all
sorts
of
things
i
want
to
know
them
all
so
that
i
may
do
them
as
she
did
i
want
to
very
much
oh
miss
ellen
dear
said
margery
tearfully
you
are
too
little
and
tender
to
do
them
things
i
be
sorry
to
see
you
indeed
why
no
i
am
not
margery
said
ellen
do
you
know
how
i
used
to
do
at
aunt
fortune
now
tell
me
please
dear
margery
if
i
ca
do
it
i
wo
you
know
oh
miss
ellen
she
used
to
see
to
various
things
about
the
house
i
do
know
as
i
can
tell
all
directly
some
was
to
help
me
and
some
to
please
her
father
or
john
if
he
was
at
home
she
thought
of
every
one
before
herself
sure
enough
well
what
margery
what
are
they
tell
me
all
you
can
remember
why
miss
ellen
for
one
thing
she
used
to
go
into
the
library
every
morning
to
put
it
in
order
and
dust
the
books
and
papers
and
things
in
fact
she
took
the
charge
of
that
room
entirely
i
never
went
into
it
at
all
unless
once
or
twice
in
the
year
or
to
wash
the
windows
ellen
looked
grave
she
thought
with
herself
there
might
be
a
difficulty
in
the
way
of
her
taking
this
part
of
alice
daily
duties
she
did
not
feel
that
she
had
the
freedom
of
the
library
and
then
said
margery
she
used
to
skim
the
cream
for
me
most
mornings
when
i
be
busy
and
wash
up
the
breakfast
things
oh
i
forgot
all
about
the
breakfast
things
exclaimed
ellen
how
could
i
i
do
them
to
be
sure
after
this
i
never
thought
of
them
margery
and
i
skim
the
cream
too
dear
miss
ellen
i
would
want
you
to
i
did
mention
it
for
that
but
you
was
wishing
me
tell
you
i
do
want
you
to
trouble
your
dear
little
head
about
such
work
it
was
more
the
thoughtfulness
that
cared
about
me
than
the
help
of
all
she
could
do
though
that
was
a
little
i
get
along
well
enough
but
i
should
like
to
it
would
make
me
happier
and
do
you
think
want
to
help
you
too
margery
the
lord
bless
you
miss
ellen
said
margery
in
a
sort
of
desperation
setting
down
one
iron
and
taking
up
another
do
talk
in
that
way
or
you
upset
me
entirely
i
ai
a
bit
better
than
a
child
said
she
her
tears
falling
fast
on
the
sheet
she
was
hurriedly
ironing
what
else
dear
margery
said
ellen
presently
tell
me
what
else
well
miss
ellen
said
margery
dashing
away
the
water
from
either
eye
she
used
to
look
over
the
clothes
when
they
went
up
from
the
wash
and
put
them
away
and
mend
them
if
there
was
any
places
wanted
mending
i
am
afraid
i
do
know
how
to
manage
that
said
ellen
very
gravely
there
is
one
thing
i
can
do
i
can
darn
stockings
very
nicely
but
that
only
one
kind
of
mending
i
do
know
much
about
the
other
kinds
ah
well
but
did
however
said
margery
searching
in
her
basket
of
clothes
for
some
particular
pieces
a
beautiful
mender
she
was
to
be
sure
look
here
miss
ellen
just
see
that
patch
the
way
it
is
put
on
so
evenly
by
a
thread
all
round
and
the
stitches
see
and
see
the
way
this
rent
is
darned
down
oh
that
was
the
way
she
did
everything
i
ca
do
it
so
said
ellen
sighing
but
i
can
learn
that
i
can
do
you
will
teach
me
margery
wo
you
indeed
miss
ellen
dear
it
more
than
i
can
myself
but
i
will
tell
you
who
will
and
that
vawse
i
am
thinking
it
was
her
she
learned
of
in
the
first
place
but
i
ai
certain
anyhow
she
a
hand
then
i
get
her
to
teach
me
said
ellen
that
will
do
very
nicely
and
now
margery
what
else
oh
dear
miss
ellen
i
do
know
there
was
a
thousand
little
things
that
i
only
recollect
at
the
minute
she
set
the
table
for
me
when
my
hands
was
uncommon
full
and
often
she
come
out
and
make
some
little
thing
for
the
master
when
i
would
have
the
time
to
do
the
same
myself
and
i
ca
tell
one
ca
think
of
those
things
but
just
at
the
minute
dear
miss
ellen
i
be
sorry
indeed
to
see
you
atrying
your
little
hands
to
do
all
that
she
done
never
mind
margery
said
ellen
and
she
threw
her
arms
round
the
kind
old
woman
as
she
spoke
i
wo
trouble
you
and
you
wo
be
troubled
if
i
am
awkward
about
anything
at
first
will
you
margery
could
only
throw
down
her
holder
to
return
most
affectionately
as
well
as
respectfully
ellen
caress
and
press
a
very
hearty
kiss
upon
her
forehead
ellen
next
went
to
vawse
to
beg
her
help
in
the
mending
and
patching
line
her
old
friend
was
very
glad
to
see
her
take
up
anything
with
interest
and
readily
agreed
to
do
her
best
in
the
matter
so
some
old
clothes
were
looked
up
pieces
of
linen
cotton
and
flannel
gathered
together
a
large
basket
found
to
hold
all
these
rags
of
shape
and
no
shape
and
for
the
next
week
or
two
ellen
was
indefatigable
she
would
sit
making
vain
endeavours
to
arrange
a
large
linen
patch
properly
till
her
cheeks
were
burning
with
excitement
and
bend
over
a
darn
doing
her
best
to
make
invisible
stitches
till
vawse
was
obliged
to
assure
her
it
was
quite
unnecessary
to
take
pains
taking
pains
however
is
the
sure
way
to
success
ellen
could
not
rest
satisfied
till
she
had
equalled
alice
patching
and
darning
and
though
when
vawse
left
her
she
had
not
quite
reached
that
point
she
was
bidding
fair
to
do
so
in
a
little
while
in
other
things
she
was
more
at
home
she
could
skim
milk
well
enough
and
immediately
began
to
do
it
for
margery
she
at
once
also
took
upon
herself
the
care
of
the
parlour
cupboard
and
all
the
things
in
it
which
she
well
knew
had
been
alice
office
and
thanks
to
miss
training
even
margery
was
quite
satisfied
with
her
neat
and
orderly
manner
of
doing
it
ellen
begged
her
when
the
clothes
came
up
from
the
wash
to
show
her
where
everything
went
so
that
for
the
future
she
might
be
able
to
put
them
away
and
she
studied
the
shelves
of
the
linen
closet
and
the
chests
of
drawers
in
humphreys
room
till
she
almost
knew
them
by
heart
as
to
the
library
she
dared
not
venture
she
saw
humphreys
at
meals
and
at
prayers
only
then
he
had
never
asked
her
to
come
into
his
study
since
the
night
she
sang
to
him
and
as
for
asking
nothing
could
have
been
more
impossible
even
when
he
was
out
of
the
house
out
by
the
hour
ellen
never
thought
of
going
where
she
had
not
been
expressly
permitted
to
go
when
van
brunt
informed
his
wife
of
ellen
purpose
to
desert
her
service
and
make
her
future
home
at
the
parsonage
the
astonishment
was
only
less
than
her
indignation
the
latter
not
at
all
lessened
by
learning
that
ellen
was
to
become
the
adopted
child
of
the
house
for
a
while
her
words
of
displeasure
were
poured
forth
in
a
torrent
van
brunt
meantime
saying
very
little
and
standing
by
like
a
steadfast
rock
that
the
waves
dash
not
she
declared
that
this
was
the
of
miss
humphreys
doings
she
might
have
been
wise
enough
to
have
expected
as
much
she
would
have
been
such
a
fool
if
she
had
this
was
what
she
had
let
ellen
go
there
for
a
pretty
return
but
she
went
on
she
wondered
who
they
thought
they
had
to
deal
with
did
they
think
she
was
going
to
let
ellen
go
in
that
way
had
the
first
and
only
right
to
her
and
ellen
had
no
more
business
to
go
and
give
herself
away
than
one
of
her
oxen
they
would
find
it
out
she
guessed
pretty
quick
john
and
all
she
have
her
back
in
no
time
what
were
her
thoughts
and
feelings
when
after
having
spent
her
breath
she
found
her
husband
quietly
opposed
to
this
conclusion
words
can
not
tell
words
could
not
she
was
absolutely
dumb
till
he
had
said
his
say
and
then
appalled
by
the
serenity
of
his
manner
she
left
indignation
on
one
side
for
the
present
and
began
to
argue
the
matter
but
van
brunt
coolly
said
he
had
promised
she
might
get
as
many
helps
as
she
liked
he
would
pay
for
them
and
welcome
but
ellen
would
have
to
stay
where
she
was
he
had
promised
miss
alice
and
he
would
break
his
word
for
kings
lords
and
commons
a
most
extraordinary
expletive
for
a
good
republican
which
van
brunt
had
probably
inherited
from
his
father
and
grandfather
what
can
waves
do
against
a
rock
the
whilome
miss
fortune
disdained
a
struggle
which
must
end
in
her
own
confusion
and
wisely
kept
her
chagrin
to
herself
never
even
approaching
the
subject
afterwards
with
him
or
any
other
person
ellen
had
left
the
whole
matter
to
van
brunt
expecting
a
storm
and
not
wishing
to
share
it
happily
it
all
blew
over
as
the
month
drew
to
an
end
and
indeed
long
before
ellen
thoughts
began
to
go
forward
eagerly
to
john
coming
home
she
had
learned
by
this
time
how
to
mend
clothes
she
had
grown
somewhat
wonted
to
her
new
round
of
little
household
duties
in
everything
else
the
want
of
him
was
felt
study
flagged
though
knowing
what
his
wish
would
be
and
what
her
duty
was
she
faithfully
tried
to
go
on
with
it
she
had
no
heart
for
riding
or
walking
by
herself
she
was
lonely
she
was
sorrowful
she
was
weary
all
vawse
pleasant
society
was
not
worth
the
mere
knowledge
that
was
in
the
house
she
longed
for
his
coming
he
had
written
what
day
they
might
expect
him
but
when
it
came
ellen
found
that
her
feeling
had
changed
it
did
not
look
the
bright
day
she
had
expected
it
would
up
to
that
time
she
had
thought
only
of
herself
now
she
remembered
what
sort
of
a
coming
home
this
must
be
to
him
and
she
dreaded
almost
as
much
as
she
wished
for
the
moment
of
his
arrival
vawse
was
surprised
to
see
that
her
face
was
sadder
that
day
than
it
had
been
for
many
past
she
could
not
understand
it
ellen
did
not
explain
it
was
late
in
the
day
before
he
reached
home
and
her
anxious
watch
of
hope
and
fear
for
the
sound
of
his
horse
feet
grew
very
painful
she
busied
herself
with
setting
the
it
was
all
done
and
she
could
by
no
means
do
anything
else
she
could
not
go
to
the
door
to
listen
there
she
remembered
too
well
the
last
time
and
she
knew
he
would
remember
it
he
came
at
last
ellen
feelings
had
judged
rightly
of
his
for
the
greeting
was
without
a
word
on
either
side
and
when
he
left
the
room
to
go
to
his
father
it
was
very
very
long
before
he
came
back
and
it
seemed
to
ellen
for
several
days
that
he
was
more
grave
and
talked
less
than
even
the
last
time
he
had
been
at
home
she
was
sorry
when
vawse
proposed
to
leave
them
but
the
old
lady
wisely
said
they
would
all
feel
better
when
she
was
gone
and
it
was
so
truly
as
she
was
respected
and
esteemed
on
all
sides
it
was
felt
a
relief
by
every
one
of
the
family
when
she
went
back
to
her
mountain
top
they
were
left
to
themselves
they
saw
what
their
numbers
were
there
was
no
restraint
upon
looks
words
or
silence
ellen
saw
at
once
that
the
gentlemen
felt
easier
that
was
enough
to
make
her
so
the
extreme
oppression
that
had
grieved
and
disappointed
her
the
first
few
days
after
john
return
gave
place
to
a
softened
gravity
and
the
household
fell
again
into
all
its
old
ways
only
that
upon
every
brow
there
was
a
chastened
air
of
sorrow
in
everything
that
was
said
a
tone
of
remembrance
and
that
a
little
figure
was
going
about
where
alice
used
to
move
as
mistress
of
the
house
thanks
to
her
brother
that
little
figure
was
an
exceeding
busy
one
she
had
in
the
first
place
her
household
duties
in
discharging
which
she
was
perfectly
untiring
from
the
cream
skimmed
for
margery
and
the
cups
of
coffee
poured
out
every
morning
for
humphreys
and
her
brother
to
the
famous
mending
which
took
up
often
one
half
of
saturday
whatever
she
did
was
done
with
her
best
diligence
and
care
and
from
love
to
both
the
dead
and
the
living
ellen
zeal
never
slackened
these
things
however
filled
but
a
small
part
of
her
time
let
her
be
as
particular
as
she
would
and
john
effectually
hindered
her
from
being
too
particular
he
soon
found
plenty
for
both
her
and
himself
to
do
not
that
they
ever
forgot
or
tried
to
forget
alice
on
the
contrary
they
sought
to
remember
her
humbly
calmly
hopefully
thankfully
by
diligent
performance
of
duty
by
christian
faith
by
conversation
and
prayer
they
strove
to
do
this
and
after
a
time
succeeded
sober
that
winter
was
but
it
was
very
far
from
being
an
unhappy
one
john
said
ellen
one
day
some
time
after
vawse
had
left
them
do
you
think
humphreys
would
let
me
go
into
his
study
every
day
when
he
is
out
to
put
it
in
order
and
dust
the
books
certainly
but
why
does
not
margery
do
it
she
does
i
believe
but
she
never
used
to
and
i
should
like
to
do
it
very
much
if
i
was
sure
he
would
not
dislike
it
i
would
be
careful
not
to
disturb
anything
i
would
leave
everything
just
as
i
found
it
you
may
go
when
you
please
and
do
what
you
please
there
ellie
but
i
do
like
to
i
could
without
speaking
to
him
first
i
should
be
afraid
he
would
come
back
and
find
me
there
and
he
might
think
i
had
had
leave
and
you
wish
to
speak
to
him
is
that
it
can
not
you
muster
resolution
enough
for
that
ellie
ellen
was
satisfied
for
she
knew
by
his
tone
he
would
do
what
she
wanted
father
said
john
the
next
morning
at
breakfast
ellen
wishes
to
take
upon
herself
the
daily
care
of
your
study
but
she
is
afraid
to
venture
without
being
assured
it
will
please
you
to
see
her
there
the
old
gentleman
laid
his
hand
affectionately
on
ellen
head
and
told
her
she
was
welcome
to
come
and
go
when
she
would
the
whole
house
was
hers
the
grave
kindness
and
tenderness
of
the
tone
and
action
spoiled
breakfast
she
could
not
look
at
anybody
nor
hold
up
her
head
for
the
rest
of
the
time
as
alice
had
anticipated
her
brother
was
called
to
take
charge
of
a
church
at
randolph
and
at
the
same
time
another
more
distant
was
offered
him
he
refused
them
both
rightly
judging
that
his
place
for
the
present
was
at
home
but
the
call
from
randolph
being
pressed
upon
him
very
much
he
at
length
agreed
to
preach
for
them
during
the
winter
riding
thither
for
the
purpose
every
saturday
and
returning
to
on
monday
as
the
winter
wore
on
a
grave
cheerfulness
stole
over
the
household
ellen
little
thought
how
much
she
had
to
do
with
it
she
never
heard
margery
tell
her
husband
which
she
often
did
with
great
affection
that
that
blessed
child
was
the
light
of
the
house
and
those
who
felt
it
the
most
said
nothing
ellen
was
sure
indeed
from
the
way
in
which
humphreys
spoke
to
her
looked
at
her
now
and
then
laid
his
hand
on
her
head
and
sometimes
very
rarely
kissed
her
forehead
that
he
loved
her
and
loved
to
see
her
about
and
that
her
wish
of
supplying
place
was
in
some
little
measure
fulfilled
few
as
those
words
and
looks
were
they
said
more
to
ellen
than
whole
discourses
would
from
other
people
the
least
of
them
gladdened
her
heart
with
the
feeling
that
she
was
a
comfort
to
him
but
she
never
knew
how
much
deep
as
the
gloom
still
over
him
was
ellen
never
dreamed
how
much
deeper
it
would
have
been
but
for
the
little
figure
flitting
round
and
filling
up
the
vacancy
how
much
he
reposed
on
the
gentle
look
of
affection
the
pleasant
voice
the
watchful
thoughtfulness
that
never
left
anything
undone
that
she
could
do
for
his
pleasure
perhaps
he
did
not
know
it
himself
she
was
not
sure
he
even
noticed
many
of
the
little
things
she
daily
did
or
tried
to
do
for
him
always
silent
and
reserved
he
was
more
so
now
than
ever
she
saw
him
little
and
very
seldom
long
at
a
time
unless
when
they
were
riding
to
church
together
he
was
always
in
his
study
or
abroad
but
the
trifles
she
thought
he
did
not
see
were
noted
and
registered
and
repaid
with
all
the
affection
he
had
to
give
as
for
john
it
never
came
into
ellen
head
to
think
whether
she
was
a
comfort
to
him
he
was
a
comfort
to
she
looked
at
it
in
quite
another
point
of
view
he
had
gone
to
his
old
upstairs
which
margery
had
settled
with
herself
he
would
make
his
study
and
for
that
he
had
taken
the
this
was
study
too
so
she
was
constantly
with
him
and
of
the
quietest
she
thought
her
movements
would
have
to
be
what
are
you
stepping
so
softly
for
said
he
one
day
catching
her
hand
as
she
was
passing
near
him
you
were
busy
i
thought
you
were
busy
said
ellen
and
what
then
i
was
afraid
of
disturbing
you
you
never
disturb
me
said
he
you
need
not
fear
it
step
as
you
please
and
do
not
shut
the
doors
carefully
i
see
you
and
hear
you
but
without
any
disturbance
ellen
found
it
was
so
but
she
was
an
exception
to
the
general
rule
other
people
disturbed
him
as
she
had
one
or
two
occasions
of
knowing
of
one
thing
she
was
perfectly
sure
whatever
he
might
be
doing
that
he
saw
and
heard
her
and
equally
sure
that
if
anything
were
not
right
she
should
sooner
or
later
hear
of
it
but
this
was
a
censorship
ellen
rather
loved
than
feared
in
the
first
place
she
was
never
misunderstood
in
the
second
however
ironical
and
severe
he
might
be
to
others
and
ellen
knew
he
could
be
both
when
there
was
occasion
he
never
was
either
to
her
with
great
plainness
always
but
with
an
equally
happy
choice
of
time
and
manner
he
either
said
or
looked
what
he
wished
her
to
understand
this
happened
indeed
only
about
comparative
trifles
to
have
seriously
displeased
him
ellen
would
have
thought
the
last
great
evil
that
could
fall
upon
her
in
this
world
one
day
margery
came
into
the
room
with
a
paper
in
her
hand
miss
ellen
said
she
in
a
low
tone
here
is
anthony
fox
again
he
has
brought
another
of
his
curious
letters
that
he
wants
to
know
if
miss
ellen
will
be
so
good
as
to
write
out
for
him
once
more
he
says
he
is
ashamed
to
trouble
you
so
much
ellen
was
reading
comfortably
ensconced
in
the
corner
of
the
wide
sofa
she
gave
a
glance
a
most
ungratified
one
at
the
very
original
document
in
margery
hand
unpromising
it
certainly
looked
another
dear
me
i
wonder
if
there
is
somebody
else
he
could
get
to
do
it
for
him
margery
i
think
i
have
had
my
share
you
do
know
what
a
piece
of
work
it
is
to
copy
out
one
of
those
scrawls
it
takes
me
ever
so
long
in
the
first
place
to
find
what
he
has
written
and
then
to
put
it
so
that
any
one
else
can
make
sense
of
it
i
got
about
enough
of
it
do
you
suppose
he
could
find
plenty
of
other
people
to
do
it
for
him
i
do
know
miss
ellen
i
suppose
he
could
then
ask
him
do
wo
you
margery
i
so
tired
of
it
and
this
is
the
third
one
and
i
got
something
else
to
do
ask
him
if
there
somebody
else
he
can
get
to
do
it
if
there
is
i
will
tell
him
i
am
busy
margery
withdrew
and
ellen
buried
herself
again
in
her
book
anthony
fox
was
a
poor
irishman
whose
uncouth
attempts
at
a
letter
ellen
had
once
offered
to
write
out
and
make
straight
for
him
upon
hearing
margery
tell
of
his
lamenting
that
he
could
not
make
one
fit
to
send
to
his
mother
presently
margery
came
in
again
stopping
this
time
at
the
table
which
john
had
pushed
to
the
far
side
of
the
room
to
get
away
from
the
fire
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
she
said
i
am
ashamed
to
be
so
troublesome
but
this
irish
body
this
anthony
fox
has
begged
me
and
i
did
know
how
to
refuse
him
to
come
in
and
ask
for
a
sheet
of
paper
and
a
pen
for
him
sir
he
wants
to
copy
a
letter
if
john
would
be
so
good
a
quill
pen
sir
if
you
please
he
can
not
write
with
any
other
no
said
john
coolly
ellen
will
do
it
margery
looked
in
some
doubt
from
the
table
to
the
sofa
but
ellen
instantly
rose
up
and
with
a
burning
cheek
came
forward
and
took
the
paper
from
the
hand
where
margery
still
held
it
ask
him
to
wait
a
little
while
margery
she
said
hurriedly
i
do
it
as
soon
as
i
can
tell
him
in
it
was
not
a
very
easy
nor
quick
job
ellen
worked
at
it
patiently
and
finished
it
well
by
the
end
of
the
though
with
a
burning
cheek
still
and
a
dimness
over
her
eyes
frequently
obliged
her
to
stop
till
she
could
clear
them
it
was
done
and
she
carried
it
out
to
the
kitchen
herself
the
poor
man
thanks
were
very
warm
but
that
was
not
what
ellen
wanted
she
could
not
rest
until
she
had
got
another
word
from
her
brother
he
was
busy
she
dared
not
speak
to
him
she
sat
fidgeting
and
uneasy
in
the
corner
of
the
sofa
till
it
was
time
to
get
ready
for
riding
she
had
plenty
of
time
to
make
up
her
mind
about
the
right
and
the
wrong
of
her
own
conduct
during
the
ride
he
was
just
as
usual
and
she
began
to
think
he
did
not
mean
to
say
anything
more
on
the
matter
pleasant
talk
and
pleasant
exercise
had
almost
driven
it
out
of
her
head
when
as
they
were
walking
their
horses
over
a
level
place
he
suddenly
began
you
are
too
busy
ellie
said
he
which
of
your
studies
shall
we
cut
off
john
said
ellen
blushing
do
say
anything
about
that
i
was
not
studying
at
all
i
was
just
amusing
myself
with
a
book
i
was
only
selfish
and
lazy
i
would
rather
you
were
too
busy
ellie
ellen
eyes
filled
i
was
wrong
she
said
i
knew
it
at
the
time
at
least
as
soon
as
you
spoke
i
knew
it
and
a
little
before
i
was
very
wrong
and
his
keen
eye
saw
that
the
confession
was
not
out
of
compliment
to
him
merely
it
came
from
the
heart
you
are
right
now
he
said
smiling
but
how
are
your
reins
ellen
heart
was
at
rest
again
oh
i
forgot
them
said
she
gaily
i
was
thinking
of
something
else
you
must
not
talk
when
you
are
riding
unless
you
can
contrive
to
manage
two
things
at
once
and
no
more
lose
command
of
your
horse
than
you
would
of
yourself
ellen
eye
met
his
with
all
the
contrition
affection
and
ingenuousness
that
even
he
wished
to
see
there
and
they
put
their
horses
to
the
canter
this
winter
was
in
many
ways
a
very
precious
one
to
ellen
french
gave
her
now
no
trouble
she
was
a
clever
arithmetician
she
knew
geography
admirably
and
was
tolerably
at
home
in
both
english
and
american
history
the
way
was
cleared
for
the
course
of
improvement
in
which
her
brother
hand
led
and
helped
her
he
put
her
into
latin
carried
on
the
study
of
natural
philosophy
they
had
begun
the
year
before
and
which
with
his
instructions
was
perfectly
delightful
to
ellen
he
gave
her
some
works
of
stronger
reading
than
she
had
yet
tried
beside
histories
in
french
and
english
and
higher
branches
of
arithmetic
these
things
were
not
crowded
together
so
as
to
fatigue
nor
hurried
through
so
as
to
overload
carefully
and
thoroughly
she
was
obliged
to
put
her
mind
through
every
subject
they
entered
upon
and
just
at
that
age
opening
as
her
understanding
was
it
grappled
eagerly
with
all
that
he
gave
her
as
well
from
love
to
learning
as
from
love
to
him
in
reading
too
she
began
to
take
new
and
strong
delight
especially
two
or
three
new
english
periodicals
which
john
sent
for
on
purpose
for
her
were
mines
of
pleasure
to
ellen
there
was
no
fiction
in
them
either
they
were
as
full
of
instruction
as
of
interest
at
all
times
of
the
day
and
night
in
her
intervals
of
business
ellen
might
be
seen
with
one
of
these
in
her
hand
nestled
among
the
cushions
of
the
sofa
or
on
a
little
bench
by
the
side
of
the
fireplace
in
the
twilight
where
she
could
have
the
benefit
of
the
blaze
which
she
loved
to
read
by
as
well
as
ever
sorrowful
remembrances
were
then
flown
all
things
present
were
out
of
view
and
ellen
face
was
dreamingly
happy
it
was
well
there
was
always
somebody
by
who
whatever
he
might
himself
be
doing
never
lost
sight
of
her
if
ever
ellen
was
in
danger
of
bending
too
long
over
her
studies
or
indulging
herself
too
much
in
the
she
was
sure
to
be
broken
off
to
take
an
hour
or
two
of
smart
exercise
riding
or
walking
or
to
recite
some
lesson
and
their
recitations
were
very
lively
things
or
to
read
aloud
or
to
talk
sometimes
if
he
saw
that
she
seemed
to
be
drooping
or
a
little
sad
he
would
come
and
sit
down
by
her
side
or
call
her
to
his
find
out
what
she
was
thinking
about
and
then
instead
of
slurring
it
over
talk
of
it
fairly
and
set
it
before
her
in
such
a
light
that
it
was
impossible
to
think
of
it
again
gloomily
for
that
day
at
least
sometimes
he
took
other
ways
but
never
when
he
was
present
allowed
her
long
to
look
weary
or
sorrowful
he
often
read
to
her
and
every
day
made
her
read
aloud
to
him
this
ellen
disliked
very
much
at
first
and
ended
with
as
much
liking
it
she
had
an
admirable
teacher
he
taught
her
how
to
manage
her
voice
and
how
to
manage
the
language
in
both
which
he
excelled
himself
and
was
determined
that
she
should
and
besides
this
their
reading
often
led
to
talking
that
ellen
delighted
in
always
when
he
was
making
copies
for
her
she
read
to
him
and
once
at
any
rate
in
the
course
of
the
day
every
day
when
the
weather
would
permit
the
black
prince
and
the
brownie
with
their
respective
riders
might
be
seen
abroad
in
the
country
far
and
wide
in
the
course
of
their
rides
ellen
horsemanship
was
diligently
perfected
very
often
their
was
on
the
top
of
the
cat
back
and
the
horses
had
a
rest
and
vawse
a
visit
before
they
went
down
again
they
had
long
walks
too
by
hill
and
dale
pleasantly
silent
or
pleasantly
talkative
all
pleasant
to
ellen
her
only
lonely
or
sorrowful
time
was
when
john
was
gone
to
randolph
it
began
early
saturday
morning
and
perhaps
ended
with
sunday
night
for
all
monday
was
hope
and
expectation
even
saturday
she
had
not
much
time
to
mope
that
was
the
day
for
her
great
week
mending
when
john
was
gone
and
her
morning
affairs
were
out
of
the
way
ellen
brought
out
her
and
established
herself
on
the
sofa
for
a
quiet
sewing
without
the
lest
fear
of
interruption
but
sewing
did
not
always
hinder
thinking
and
then
certainly
the
room
did
seem
very
empty
and
very
still
and
the
clock
which
she
never
heard
the
rest
of
the
week
kept
ticking
an
ungracious
reminder
that
she
was
alone
ellen
would
sometimes
forget
it
in
the
intense
interest
of
some
nice
little
piece
of
repair
which
must
be
exquisitely
done
in
a
wristband
or
a
glove
and
then
perhaps
margery
would
softly
open
the
door
and
come
in
miss
ellen
dear
you
lonesome
enough
is
there
something
i
can
do
for
you
i
ca
rest
for
thinking
of
your
being
here
all
by
yourself
oh
never
mind
said
ellen
smiling
i
am
doing
very
well
i
am
living
in
hopes
of
monday
come
and
look
here
margery
how
will
that
do
do
you
think
i
am
learning
to
mend
it
beautiful
miss
ellen
i
ca
make
out
how
you
learned
so
quick
i
tell
john
some
time
who
does
these
things
for
him
no
indeed
margery
do
you
not
margery
i
like
to
do
it
very
much
indeed
but
i
do
want
he
should
know
it
nor
humphreys
now
you
wo
margery
will
you
miss
ellen
dear
i
would
do
the
least
little
thing
as
would
be
worrisome
to
you
for
the
whole
world
are
you
tired
sitting
here
all
alone
oh
sometimes
a
little
said
ellen
sighing
i
ca
help
that
you
know
i
feel
it
even
out
there
in
the
kitchen
said
margery
i
feel
it
lonesome
hearing
the
house
so
still
i
miss
the
want
of
john
step
up
and
down
the
room
how
fond
he
is
of
walking
so
to
be
sure
how
do
you
manage
miss
ellen
with
him
making
his
study
here
do
you
have
to
keep
uncommon
quiet
no
said
ellen
no
quieter
than
i
like
i
do
just
as
i
have
a
mind
to
i
thought
to
be
sure
said
margery
he
would
have
taken
upstairs
for
his
study
or
the
next
room
one
or
he
used
to
be
mighty
particular
in
old
times
he
did
like
to
have
anybody
round
when
he
was
busy
but
i
am
glad
he
is
altered
however
it
is
better
for
you
miss
ellen
dear
though
i
did
know
how
you
was
ever
going
to
make
out
at
first
ellen
thought
for
a
minute
when
margery
was
gone
whether
it
could
be
that
john
was
putting
a
force
upon
his
liking
for
her
sake
bearing
her
presence
when
he
would
rather
have
been
without
it
but
she
thought
of
it
only
a
minute
she
was
sure
when
she
recollected
herself
that
however
it
happened
she
was
no
hindrance
to
him
in
any
kind
of
work
that
she
went
out
and
came
in
and
as
he
had
said
he
saw
and
heard
her
without
any
disturbance
besides
he
had
said
so
and
that
was
enough
saturday
evening
she
generally
contrived
to
busy
herself
in
her
books
but
when
sunday
morning
came
with
its
calmness
and
brightness
when
the
business
of
the
week
was
put
away
and
quietness
abroad
and
at
home
invited
to
recollection
then
ellen
thoughts
went
back
to
old
times
and
then
she
missed
the
calm
sweet
face
that
had
agreed
so
well
with
the
day
she
missed
her
in
the
morning
when
the
early
sun
streamed
in
through
the
empty
room
she
missed
her
at
the
where
john
was
not
to
take
her
place
on
the
ride
to
church
where
humphreys
was
now
her
silent
companion
and
every
tree
on
the
road
and
every
opening
in
the
landscape
seemed
to
call
alice
to
see
it
with
her
very
much
she
missed
her
in
church
the
empty
seat
beside
her
the
unused
on
the
shelf
the
want
of
her
sweet
voice
in
the
singing
oh
how
it
went
to
ellen
heart
and
humphreys
grave
steadfast
look
and
tone
kept
it
in
her
mind
she
saw
it
was
in
his
those
sunday
mornings
tried
ellen
at
first
they
were
bitterly
sad
her
tears
used
to
flow
abundantly
whenever
they
could
unseen
time
softened
this
feeling
while
humphreys
went
on
to
his
second
service
in
the
village
beyond
ellen
stayed
at
and
tried
to
teach
a
she
determined
as
far
as
she
could
to
supply
beyond
the
home
circle
the
loss
that
was
not
felt
only
there
she
was
able
however
to
gather
together
but
her
own
four
children
whom
she
had
constantly
taught
from
the
beginning
and
two
others
the
rest
were
scattered
after
her
lunch
which
having
no
companion
but
margery
was
now
a
short
one
ellen
went
next
to
the
two
old
women
that
alice
had
been
accustomed
to
attend
for
the
purpose
of
reading
and
what
ellen
called
preaching
these
poor
old
people
had
sadly
lamented
the
loss
of
the
faithful
friend
whose
place
they
never
expected
to
see
supplied
in
this
world
and
whose
kindness
had
constantly
sweetened
their
lives
with
one
great
pleasure
a
week
ellen
felt
afraid
to
take
so
much
upon
herself
as
to
try
to
do
for
them
what
alice
had
done
however
she
resolved
and
at
the
very
first
attempt
their
gratitude
and
joy
far
overpaid
her
for
the
effort
she
had
made
practice
and
the
motive
she
had
soon
enabled
ellen
to
remember
and
repeat
faithfully
the
greater
part
of
humphreys
morning
sermon
reading
the
bible
to
blockson
was
easy
she
had
often
done
that
and
to
repair
the
loss
of
alice
pleasant
comments
and
explanations
she
bethought
her
of
her
progress
to
her
delight
the
old
woman
heard
it
greedily
and
seemed
to
take
great
comfort
in
it
often
referring
to
what
ellen
had
read
before
and
begging
to
hear
such
a
piece
over
again
ellen
generally
went
home
pretty
thoroughly
tired
yet
feeling
happy
the
pleasure
of
doing
good
still
far
overbalanced
the
pains
sunday
evening
was
another
lonely
time
ellen
spent
it
as
best
she
could
sometimes
with
her
bible
and
prayer
and
then
she
ceased
to
be
lonely
sometimes
with
so
many
pleasant
thoughts
that
had
sprung
up
out
of
the
employments
of
the
morning
that
she
could
not
be
sorrowful
sometimes
she
could
not
help
being
both
in
any
case
she
was
very
apt
when
the
darkness
fell
to
take
to
singing
hymns
and
it
grew
to
be
a
habit
with
humphreys
when
he
heard
her
to
come
out
of
his
study
and
lie
down
upon
the
sofa
and
listen
suffering
no
light
in
the
room
but
that
of
the
fire
ellen
never
was
better
pleased
than
when
her
sunday
evenings
were
spent
so
she
sang
with
wonderful
pleasure
when
she
sang
for
him
and
she
made
it
her
business
to
fill
her
memory
with
all
the
beautiful
hymns
she
ever
knew
or
could
find
or
that
he
liked
particularly
with
the
first
opening
of
her
eyes
on
monday
morning
came
the
thought
john
will
be
at
home
that
was
enough
to
carry
ellen
pleasantly
through
whatever
the
day
might
bring
she
generally
kept
her
mending
of
stockings
for
monday
morning
because
with
that
thought
in
head
she
did
not
mind
anything
she
had
no
visits
from
margery
on
monday
but
ellen
sang
over
her
work
sprang
about
with
happy
energy
and
studied
the
hardest
for
john
in
what
he
expected
her
to
do
made
no
calculations
for
work
of
which
he
knew
nothing
he
was
never
at
home
till
late
in
the
day
and
when
ellen
had
done
all
she
had
to
do
and
set
the
with
punctilious
care
and
a
face
of
busy
happiness
it
would
have
been
a
pleasure
to
see
if
there
had
been
any
one
to
look
at
it
she
would
take
what
happened
to
be
the
favourite
book
and
plant
herself
near
the
glass
door
like
a
very
epicure
to
enjoy
both
the
present
and
the
future
at
once
even
then
the
present
often
made
her
forget
the
future
she
would
be
lost
in
her
book
perhaps
hunting
the
elephant
in
india
or
fighting
nelson
battles
over
again
and
the
first
news
she
would
have
of
what
she
had
set
herself
there
to
watch
for
would
be
the
click
of
the
or
a
tap
on
the
glass
for
the
horse
was
almost
always
left
at
the
further
door
back
then
she
came
from
india
or
the
nile
down
went
the
book
ellen
had
no
more
thought
but
for
what
was
before
her
for
the
rest
of
that
evening
the
measure
of
ellen
happiness
was
full
it
did
not
matter
whether
john
were
in
a
talkative
or
a
thoughtful
mood
whether
he
spoke
to
her
and
looked
at
her
or
not
it
was
pleasure
enough
to
feel
that
he
was
there
she
was
perfectly
satisfied
merely
to
sit
down
near
him
though
she
did
not
get
a
word
by
the
hour
together
chapter
xlv
ne
in
all
the
welkin
was
no
cloud
chaucer
one
monday
evening
john
being
tired
was
resting
in
the
corner
of
the
sofa
the
silence
had
lasted
a
long
time
ellen
thought
so
and
standing
near
she
put
her
hand
gently
into
one
of
his
which
he
was
thoughtfully
passing
through
the
locks
of
his
hair
her
hand
was
clasped
immediately
and
quitting
his
abstracted
look
he
asked
what
she
had
been
doing
that
day
ellen
thoughts
went
back
to
toes
of
stockings
and
a
long
rent
in
her
dress
she
merely
answered
smiling
that
she
had
been
busy
too
busy
i
afraid
come
round
here
and
sit
down
what
have
you
been
busy
about
ellen
never
thought
of
trying
to
evade
a
question
of
his
she
coloured
and
hesitated
he
did
not
press
it
any
further
john
said
ellen
when
the
silence
seemed
to
have
set
in
again
there
is
something
i
have
been
wanting
to
ask
you
this
great
while
why
has
it
been
this
great
while
i
did
quite
like
to
i
did
know
what
you
would
say
to
it
i
am
sorry
i
am
at
all
terrible
to
you
ellie
why
you
are
not
said
ellen
laughing
how
you
talk
but
i
much
like
to
ask
people
things
i
do
know
about
that
said
he
smiling
my
memory
rather
seems
to
say
that
you
ask
things
pretty
often
ah
yes
those
things
but
i
mean
i
do
like
to
ask
things
when
i
am
not
quite
sure
how
people
will
take
it
you
are
right
certainly
to
hesitate
when
you
are
doubtful
in
such
a
matter
but
it
is
best
not
to
be
doubtful
when
i
am
concerned
well
said
ellen
i
wish
very
much
i
was
going
to
ask
if
you
would
have
any
objection
to
let
me
read
one
of
your
sermons
none
in
the
world
ellie
said
he
smiling
but
they
have
never
been
written
yet
not
written
no
there
is
all
i
had
to
guide
me
yesterday
a
half
sheet
of
paper
and
only
written
on
one
side
oh
i
can
make
nothing
of
this
what
is
hebrew
shorthand
and
is
that
all
i
can
not
understand
it
said
ellen
sighing
as
she
gave
back
the
paper
what
if
you
were
to
go
with
me
next
time
they
want
to
see
you
very
much
at
ventnor
so
do
i
want
to
see
them
said
ellen
very
much
indeed
marshman
sent
a
most
earnest
request
by
me
that
you
would
come
to
her
the
next
time
i
go
to
randolph
ellen
gave
the
matter
a
very
serious
consideration
if
one
might
judge
by
her
face
what
do
you
say
to
it
i
should
like
to
go
much
said
ellen
slowly
but
but
you
do
not
think
it
would
be
pleasant
no
no
said
ellen
laughing
i
do
mean
that
but
i
think
i
would
rather
not
why
oh
i
have
some
reasons
you
must
give
me
very
good
ones
or
i
think
i
shall
overrule
your
decision
ellie
i
have
good
ones
plenty
of
them
only
a
glance
somewhat
comical
in
its
keenness
overturned
hesitation
i
have
indeed
said
she
laughing
only
i
did
not
want
to
tell
you
the
reason
why
i
did
wish
to
go
was
because
i
thought
i
should
be
missed
you
do
know
how
much
i
miss
you
said
she
with
tears
in
her
eyes
that
is
what
i
was
afraid
of
your
reasons
make
against
you
ellie
i
hope
not
i
do
think
they
ought
but
ellie
i
am
very
sure
my
father
would
rather
miss
you
once
or
twice
than
have
you
want
what
would
be
good
for
you
i
know
that
i
am
sure
of
that
but
that
do
alter
my
feeling
you
know
and
besides
that
is
all
who
else
will
miss
you
ellen
quick
look
seemed
to
say
that
he
knew
too
much
already
and
that
she
did
not
wish
him
to
know
more
he
did
not
repeat
the
question
but
ellen
felt
that
her
secret
was
no
longer
entirely
her
own
and
what
do
you
do
ellie
when
you
feel
lonely
he
went
on
presently
ellen
eyes
watered
at
the
tone
in
which
these
words
were
spoken
she
answered
different
things
the
best
remedy
for
it
is
prayer
in
seeking
the
face
of
our
best
friend
we
forget
the
loss
of
others
that
is
what
i
try
ellie
when
i
feel
alone
do
you
try
it
said
he
softly
ellen
looked
up
she
could
not
well
speak
at
that
moment
there
is
an
antidote
in
that
for
every
trouble
you
know
who
said
that
cometh
to
me
shall
never
hunger
and
he
that
believeth
on
me
shall
never
thirst
it
troubles
me
said
he
after
a
pause
to
leave
you
so
much
alone
i
do
know
that
it
were
not
best
to
take
you
with
me
every
week
oh
no
said
ellen
do
think
of
me
i
do
mind
it
indeed
i
do
not
always
feel
so
sometimes
but
i
get
along
very
well
and
i
would
rather
stay
here
indeed
i
would
i
am
always
happy
as
soon
as
monday
morning
comes
he
rose
up
suddenly
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
john
what
ellie
i
do
sometimes
seek
his
face
very
much
when
i
can
not
find
it
she
hid
her
face
in
the
sofa
cushion
he
was
silent
a
few
minutes
and
then
stopped
his
walk
there
is
something
wrong
then
with
you
ellie
he
said
gently
how
has
it
been
through
the
week
if
you
can
let
day
after
day
pass
without
remembering
your
best
friend
it
may
be
that
when
you
feel
the
want
you
will
not
readily
find
him
how
is
it
daily
ellie
is
seeking
his
face
your
first
concern
do
you
give
a
sufficient
time
faithfully
to
your
bible
and
prayer
ellen
shook
her
head
no
words
were
possible
he
took
up
his
walk
again
the
silence
had
lasted
a
length
of
time
and
he
was
still
walking
when
ellen
came
to
his
side
and
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
have
you
settled
that
question
with
your
conscience
ellie
she
weepingly
answered
yes
they
walked
a
few
turns
up
and
down
will
you
promise
me
ellie
that
every
day
when
it
shall
be
possible
you
will
give
an
hour
to
this
business
whatever
else
may
be
done
or
undone
ellen
promised
and
then
with
her
hand
in
his
they
continued
their
walk
through
the
room
till
humphreys
and
the
servants
came
in
her
brother
prayer
that
night
ellen
never
forgot
no
more
was
said
at
that
time
about
her
going
to
ventnor
but
a
week
or
two
after
john
smilingly
told
her
to
get
all
her
private
affairs
arranged
and
to
let
her
friends
know
they
need
not
expect
to
see
her
the
next
sunday
for
that
he
was
going
to
take
her
with
him
as
she
saw
he
had
made
up
his
mind
ellen
said
nothing
in
the
way
of
objecting
and
now
that
the
decision
was
taken
from
her
was
really
very
glad
to
go
she
arranged
everything
as
he
had
said
and
was
ready
saturday
morning
to
set
off
with
a
very
light
heart
they
went
in
the
sleigh
in
a
happy
quiet
mood
of
mind
ellen
enjoyed
everything
exceedingly
she
had
not
been
to
ventnor
in
several
months
the
change
of
scene
was
very
grateful
she
could
not
help
thinking
as
they
slid
along
smoothly
and
swiftly
over
the
snow
that
it
a
good
deal
pleasanter
for
once
than
sitting
alone
in
the
parlour
at
home
with
her
those
days
of
solitary
duty
however
had
prepared
her
for
the
pleasure
of
this
one
ellen
knew
that
and
was
ready
to
be
thankful
for
everything
throughout
the
whole
way
whether
the
eye
and
mind
silently
indulged
in
roving
or
still
better
loved
talk
interrupted
as
it
often
did
ellen
was
in
a
state
of
most
unmixed
and
unruffled
satisfaction
john
had
not
the
slightest
reason
to
doubt
the
correctness
of
his
judgment
in
bringing
her
he
went
in
but
a
moment
at
ventnor
and
leaving
her
there
proceeded
himself
to
randolph
ellen
was
received
as
a
precious
lending
that
must
be
taken
the
greatest
care
of
and
enjoyed
as
much
as
possible
while
one
has
it
marshman
and
chauncey
treated
her
as
if
she
had
been
their
own
child
ellen
chauncey
overwhelmed
her
with
joyful
caresses
and
could
scarcely
let
her
out
of
her
arms
by
night
or
by
day
she
was
more
than
ever
marshman
pet
but
indeed
she
was
well
petted
by
all
the
family
it
was
a
very
happy
visit
even
sunday
left
nothing
to
wish
for
to
her
great
joy
not
only
chauncey
went
with
her
in
the
morning
to
hear
her
brother
for
his
church
was
not
the
one
the
family
attended
but
the
carriage
was
ordered
in
the
afternoon
also
and
chauncey
and
her
daughter
and
miss
sophia
went
with
her
again
when
they
returned
miss
sophia
who
had
taken
a
very
great
fancy
to
her
brought
her
into
her
own
room
and
made
her
lie
down
with
her
upon
the
bed
though
ellen
insisted
she
was
not
tired
well
you
ought
to
be
if
you
are
not
said
the
lady
i
am
keep
away
ellen
chauncey
you
ca
be
anywhere
without
talking
you
can
live
without
ellen
for
hour
ca
ye
leave
us
a
little
while
in
quiet
ellen
for
her
part
was
quite
willing
to
be
quiet
but
miss
sophia
was
not
sleepy
and
it
soon
appeared
had
no
intention
of
being
silent
herself
well
how
do
you
like
your
brother
in
the
pulpit
she
began
i
like
him
anywhere
said
ellen
with
a
very
unequivocal
smile
i
thought
he
would
have
come
here
with
you
last
night
it
is
very
mean
of
him
he
never
comes
near
us
he
always
goes
to
some
wretched
little
lodging
or
place
in
the
town
there
always
never
so
much
as
looks
at
ventnor
unless
sometimes
he
may
stop
for
a
minute
at
the
door
he
said
he
would
come
here
said
ellen
amazing
condescending
of
him
however
he
is
like
anybody
else
i
suppose
we
must
not
judge
him
by
common
rules
how
is
humphreys
ellen
i
do
know
said
ellen
it
is
hard
to
tell
he
does
say
much
i
think
he
is
rather
more
cheerful
if
anything
than
i
expected
he
would
be
and
how
do
you
get
along
there
poor
child
with
only
two
such
grave
people
about
you
i
get
along
very
well
said
ellen
with
what
miss
sophia
thought
a
somewhat
curious
smile
i
believe
you
will
grow
to
be
as
sober
as
the
rest
of
them
said
she
how
does
john
behave
ellen
turned
so
indubitably
curious
a
look
upon
her
at
this
that
miss
sophia
half
laughed
and
went
on
humphreys
was
not
always
as
silent
and
reserved
as
he
is
now
i
remember
him
when
he
was
different
though
i
do
think
he
ever
was
much
like
his
son
did
you
ever
hear
about
it
about
what
oh
about
coming
to
this
country
what
brought
him
to
no
my
father
you
see
had
come
out
long
before
but
the
two
families
had
been
always
very
intimate
in
england
and
it
was
kept
up
after
he
came
away
he
was
a
particular
friend
of
an
elder
brother
of
humphreys
his
estate
and
my
grandfather
lay
very
near
each
other
and
besides
there
were
other
things
that
drew
them
to
each
other
he
married
my
aunt
for
one
my
father
made
several
journeys
back
and
forth
in
the
course
of
years
and
so
kept
up
his
attachment
to
the
whole
family
you
know
and
he
became
very
desirous
to
get
humphreys
over
here
this
humphreys
you
know
he
was
the
younger
brother
younger
brothers
in
england
generally
have
little
or
nothing
but
you
do
know
anything
about
that
ellen
had
anything
then
but
his
living
and
that
was
a
small
one
he
had
some
property
left
him
though
just
before
he
came
to
america
but
miss
sophia
ellen
hesitated
are
you
sure
they
would
like
i
should
hear
all
this
why
yes
child
of
course
they
would
everybody
knows
it
some
things
made
humphreys
as
willing
to
leave
england
about
that
time
as
my
father
was
to
have
him
an
excellent
situation
was
offered
him
in
one
of
the
best
institutions
here
and
he
came
out
that
about
let
me
see
i
was
just
twelve
years
old
and
alice
was
one
year
younger
she
and
i
were
just
like
sisters
always
from
that
time
we
lived
near
together
and
saw
each
other
every
day
and
our
two
families
were
just
like
one
but
they
were
liked
by
everybody
humphreys
was
a
very
fine
person
very
oh
very
i
never
saw
any
woman
i
admired
more
her
death
almost
killed
her
husband
and
i
think
alice
i
do
know
there
is
the
least
sign
of
delicate
health
about
humphreys
nor
john
not
the
slightest
nor
about
humphreys
either
she
was
a
very
fine
woman
how
long
ago
did
she
die
said
ellen
five
six
seven
seven
years
ago
john
had
been
left
in
england
till
a
little
before
humphreys
was
never
the
same
after
that
he
would
hold
his
professorship
any
longer
he
could
bear
society
he
just
went
and
buried
himself
at
that
was
a
little
after
we
came
here
how
much
all
this
interested
ellen
she
was
glad
however
when
miss
sophia
seemed
to
have
talked
herself
out
for
she
wanted
very
much
to
think
over
john
sermon
and
as
miss
sophia
happily
fell
into
a
doze
soon
after
she
had
a
long
quiet
time
for
it
till
it
grew
dark
and
ellen
chauncey
whose
impatience
could
hold
no
longer
came
to
seek
her
john
came
in
the
evening
ellen
patience
and
politeness
were
severely
tried
in
the
course
of
it
for
while
she
longed
exceedingly
to
hear
what
her
brother
and
the
older
members
of
the
family
were
talking
about
animated
delightful
conversation
she
was
sure
ellen
chauncey
detained
her
in
another
part
of
the
room
and
for
a
good
part
of
the
evening
she
had
to
bridle
her
impatience
and
attend
to
what
she
did
not
care
about
she
did
it
and
ellen
chauncey
did
not
suspect
it
and
at
last
she
found
means
to
draw
both
her
and
herself
near
the
larger
group
but
they
seemed
to
have
got
through
what
they
were
talking
about
there
was
a
lull
ellen
waited
and
hoped
they
would
begin
again
you
had
a
full
church
this
afternoon
john
said
miss
sophia
he
bowed
gravely
did
you
know
whom
you
had
among
your
auditors
the
and
were
there
naming
some
distinguished
strangers
in
the
neighbourhood
i
think
i
saw
them
you
you
did
is
that
an
excess
of
pride
or
an
excess
of
modesty
now
do
be
a
reasonable
creature
and
confess
that
you
are
not
insensible
to
the
pleasure
and
honour
of
addressing
such
an
audience
ellen
saw
something
like
a
flash
of
contempt
for
an
instant
in
his
face
instantly
succeeded
by
a
smile
honestly
miss
sophia
i
was
much
more
interested
in
an
old
woman
that
sat
at
the
foot
of
the
pulpit
stairs
that
old
thing
said
miss
sophia
i
saw
her
said
chauncey
poor
old
creature
she
seemed
most
deeply
attentive
when
i
looked
at
her
i
saw
her
cried
ellen
chauncey
and
the
tears
were
running
down
her
cheeks
several
times
i
did
see
her
said
ellen
montgomery
as
john
eye
met
hers
he
smiled
but
do
you
mean
to
say
continued
miss
sophia
that
you
are
absolutely
careless
as
to
who
hears
you
i
have
always
one
hearer
miss
sophia
of
so
much
dignity
that
it
sinks
the
rest
into
great
insignificance
that
is
a
rebuke
said
miss
sophia
but
nevertheless
i
shall
tell
you
that
i
liked
you
very
much
this
afternoon
he
was
silent
i
suppose
you
will
tell
me
next
said
the
young
lady
laughing
that
you
are
sorry
to
hear
me
say
so
i
am
said
he
gravely
why
may
i
ask
you
show
me
that
i
have
quite
failed
in
my
aim
so
far
at
least
as
one
of
my
hearers
was
concerned
how
do
you
know
that
do
you
remember
what
louis
the
fourteenth
said
to
massillon
mon
père
entendu
plusieurs
grands
orateurs
dans
ma
chapelle
ai
été
fort
content
pour
vous
toutes
les
fois
que
je
vous
ai
entendu
été
très
mécontent
de
ellen
smiled
miss
sophia
was
silent
for
an
instant
then
you
really
mean
to
be
understood
that
provided
you
fail
of
your
aim
as
you
say
you
do
not
care
a
straw
what
people
think
of
you
as
i
would
take
a
bankrupt
promissory
note
in
lieu
of
told
gold
it
gives
me
small
gratification
miss
sophia
very
small
indeed
to
see
the
bowing
head
of
the
grain
that
yet
my
sickle
can
not
reach
i
agree
with
you
most
heartily
said
george
marshman
the
conversation
dropped
and
the
two
gentlemen
began
another
in
an
undertone
pacing
up
and
down
the
floor
together
the
next
morning
not
sorrowfully
ellen
entered
the
sleigh
again
and
they
set
off
homewards
what
a
sober
little
piece
that
is
said
howard
oh
sober
cried
ellen
chauncey
that
is
because
you
do
know
her
uncle
howard
she
is
the
cheerfullest
happiest
girl
that
i
ever
saw
always
except
ellen
chauncey
always
said
her
uncle
she
is
a
singular
child
said
gillespie
she
is
grave
certainly
but
she
do
look
moped
at
all
and
i
should
think
she
would
be
to
death
there
not
a
bit
of
moping
about
her
said
miss
sophia
she
can
laugh
and
smile
as
well
as
anybody
though
she
has
sometimes
that
peculiar
grave
look
of
the
eyes
that
would
make
a
stranger
doubt
it
i
think
john
humphreys
has
infected
her
he
has
something
of
the
same
look
himself
i
am
not
sure
whether
it
is
the
eyes
or
the
mouth
sophia
said
howard
it
is
both
said
miss
sophia
did
you
ever
see
the
eyes
look
one
way
and
the
mouth
another
and
besides
said
ellen
chauncey
she
has
reason
to
look
sober
i
am
sure
she
is
a
fascinating
child
said
gillespie
i
can
not
comprehend
where
she
gets
the
manner
she
has
i
never
saw
a
more
perfectly
polite
child
and
there
she
has
been
for
months
with
nobody
to
speak
to
her
but
two
gentlemen
and
the
servants
it
is
natural
to
her
i
suppose
she
can
have
nobody
to
teach
her
i
am
not
so
sure
as
to
that
said
miss
sophia
but
i
have
noticed
the
same
thing
often
did
you
observe
her
last
night
matilda
when
john
humphreys
came
in
you
were
talking
to
her
at
the
moment
i
saw
her
before
the
door
was
opened
i
saw
the
colour
come
and
her
eyes
sparkle
but
she
did
not
look
towards
him
for
an
instant
till
you
had
finished
what
you
were
saying
to
her
and
she
had
given
as
she
always
does
her
modest
quiet
answer
and
then
her
eye
went
straight
as
an
arrow
to
where
he
was
standing
and
yet
said
chauncey
she
never
moved
towards
him
when
you
did
but
stayed
quietly
on
that
side
of
the
room
with
the
young
ones
till
he
came
round
to
them
and
it
was
some
time
too
she
is
an
odd
child
said
miss
sophia
laughing
what
do
you
think
she
said
to
me
yesterday
i
was
talking
to
her
and
getting
rather
communicative
on
the
subject
of
my
neighbours
affairs
and
she
asked
me
gravely
the
little
monkey
if
i
was
sure
they
would
like
her
to
hear
it
i
felt
quite
rebuked
though
i
did
choose
to
let
her
know
as
much
i
wish
john
would
bring
her
every
week
said
ellen
chauncey
sighing
it
would
be
so
pleasant
to
have
her
towards
the
end
of
the
winter
humphreys
began
to
propose
that
his
son
should
visit
england
and
scotland
during
the
following
summer
he
wished
him
to
see
his
family
and
to
know
his
native
country
as
well
as
some
of
the
most
distinguished
men
and
institutions
in
both
kingdoms
george
marshman
also
urged
upon
him
some
business
in
which
he
thought
he
could
be
eminently
useful
but
john
declined
both
propositions
still
thinking
he
had
more
important
duties
at
home
this
only
cloud
that
rose
above
ellen
horizon
scattered
away
one
evening
it
was
a
monday
in
the
twilight
john
was
as
usual
pacing
up
and
down
the
floor
ellen
was
reading
in
the
window
too
late
for
you
ellie
yes
said
ellen
i
know
i
will
stop
in
two
minutes
but
in
a
quarter
of
that
time
she
had
lost
every
thought
of
stopping
and
knew
no
longer
that
it
was
growing
dusk
somebody
else
however
had
not
forgotten
it
the
two
minutes
were
not
ended
when
a
hand
came
between
her
and
the
page
and
quietly
drew
the
book
away
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
cried
ellen
starting
up
i
entirely
forgot
all
about
it
he
did
not
look
displeased
he
was
smiling
he
drew
her
arm
within
his
come
and
walk
with
me
have
you
had
any
exercise
no
why
not
i
had
a
good
deal
to
do
and
i
had
fixed
myself
so
nicely
on
the
sofa
with
my
books
and
it
looked
cold
and
disagreeable
out
of
doors
since
when
have
you
ceased
to
be
a
fixture
what
oh
said
ellen
laughing
how
shall
i
ever
get
rid
of
that
troublesome
word
what
shall
i
say
i
had
myself
myself
so
nicely
on
the
sofa
and
did
you
think
that
a
sufficient
reason
for
not
going
out
no
said
ellen
i
did
not
and
i
did
not
decide
that
i
would
not
go
and
yet
i
let
it
keep
me
at
home
after
all
just
as
i
did
about
reading
a
few
minutes
ago
i
meant
to
stop
but
i
forgot
and
i
should
have
gone
on
i
do
know
how
long
if
you
had
not
stopped
me
i
very
often
do
so
he
paused
a
minute
and
then
said
you
must
not
do
so
any
more
ellie
the
tone
in
which
there
was
a
great
deal
both
of
love
and
decision
wound
round
ellen
heart
and
constrained
her
to
answer
immediately
i
will
not
i
will
not
never
parley
with
conscience
it
a
dangerous
habit
but
then
it
was
only
about
trifles
i
grant
you
but
the
habit
is
no
trifle
there
will
not
be
a
just
firmness
of
mind
and
steadfastness
of
action
where
tampering
with
duty
is
permitted
even
in
little
things
i
will
try
not
to
do
it
ellen
repeated
no
said
he
smiling
let
it
stand
as
at
first
will
means
something
will
is
very
apt
to
come
to
nothing
will
keep
thy
precepts
with
my
whole
heart
not
will
your
reliance
is
precisely
the
same
in
either
case
i
will
not
john
said
ellen
smiling
what
were
you
poring
over
so
intently
a
while
ago
it
was
an
old
magazine
blackwood
magazine
i
believe
is
the
name
of
it
i
found
two
great
piles
of
them
in
a
closet
upstairs
the
other
day
and
i
brought
this
one
down
this
is
the
first
that
you
have
read
yes
i
got
very
much
interested
in
a
curious
story
there
why
what
will
you
say
ellie
if
i
ask
you
to
leave
the
rest
of
the
two
piles
unopened
why
i
will
say
that
i
will
do
it
of
course
said
ellen
with
a
little
smothered
sigh
of
regret
however
if
you
wish
it
i
do
wish
it
ellie
very
well
i
let
them
alone
then
i
have
enough
other
reading
i
do
know
how
i
happened
to
take
that
one
up
because
i
saw
it
there
i
suppose
have
you
finished
nelson
yet
oh
yes
i
finished
it
saturday
night
oh
i
like
it
very
much
i
am
going
all
over
it
again
though
i
like
nelson
very
much
do
you
yes
as
well
as
i
can
like
a
man
of
very
fine
qualities
without
principle
was
he
that
said
ellen
yes
did
you
not
find
it
out
i
am
afraid
your
eyes
were
blinded
by
admiration
were
they
said
ellen
i
thought
he
was
so
very
fine
in
everything
and
i
should
be
sorry
to
think
he
was
not
look
over
the
book
again
by
all
means
with
a
more
critical
eye
and
when
you
have
done
so
you
shall
give
me
your
cool
estimate
of
his
character
oh
me
said
ellen
well
but
i
do
know
whether
i
can
give
you
a
estimate
of
him
however
i
try
i
can
not
think
coolly
of
him
now
just
after
trafalgar
i
think
it
was
a
shame
that
collingwood
did
not
anchor
as
nelson
told
him
to
do
you
i
think
he
might
have
been
obeyed
while
he
was
living
at
least
it
is
difficult
said
john
smiling
to
judge
correctly
of
many
actions
without
having
been
on
the
spot
and
in
the
circumstances
of
the
actors
i
believe
you
and
i
must
leave
the
question
of
trafalgar
to
more
nautical
heads
how
pleasant
this
moonlight
is
said
ellen
what
makes
it
pleasant
what
it
pleasant
i
do
know
i
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
it
is
to
be
pleasant
i
ca
tell
can
anybody
the
eye
loves
light
for
many
reasons
but
all
kinds
of
light
are
not
equally
agreeable
what
makes
the
peculiar
charm
of
those
long
streams
of
pale
light
across
the
floor
and
the
shadowy
brightness
without
you
must
tell
said
ellen
i
can
not
you
know
we
enjoy
anything
much
more
by
contrast
i
think
that
is
one
reason
night
is
the
reign
of
darkness
which
we
do
not
love
and
here
is
light
struggling
with
the
darkness
not
enough
to
overcome
it
entirely
but
yet
banishing
it
to
nooks
and
corners
and
distant
parts
by
the
side
of
which
it
shows
itself
in
contrasted
beauty
our
eyes
bless
the
unwonted
victory
yes
said
ellen
we
only
have
moonlight
nights
once
in
a
while
but
that
is
only
one
reason
out
of
many
and
not
the
greatest
it
is
a
very
refined
pleasure
and
to
resolve
it
into
its
elements
is
something
like
trying
to
divide
one
of
these
same
white
rays
of
light
into
the
many
various
coloured
ones
that
go
to
form
it
and
not
by
any
means
so
easy
a
task
then
it
is
no
wonder
i
could
answer
said
ellen
no
you
are
hardly
a
philosopher
yet
ellie
the
moonlight
is
so
calm
and
quiet
ellen
observed
admiringly
and
why
is
it
calm
and
quiet
i
must
have
an
answer
to
that
because
are
generally
calm
and
quiet
at
such
times
ellen
ventured
after
a
little
thought
precisely
we
and
the
world
and
association
has
given
the
moon
herself
the
same
character
besides
that
her
mild
sober
light
is
not
fitted
for
the
purposes
of
active
employment
and
therefore
the
more
graciously
invites
us
to
the
pleasures
of
thought
and
fancy
i
am
loving
it
more
and
more
the
more
you
talk
about
it
said
ellen
and
there
you
have
touched
another
reason
ellie
for
the
pleasure
we
have
not
only
in
moonlight
but
in
most
other
things
when
two
things
have
been
in
the
mind
together
and
made
any
impression
the
mind
them
and
you
can
not
see
or
think
of
the
one
without
bringing
back
the
remembrance
or
the
feeling
of
the
other
if
we
have
enjoyed
the
moonlight
in
pleasant
scenes
in
happy
hours
with
friends
that
we
loved
though
the
sight
of
it
may
not
always
make
us
directly
remember
them
it
yet
brings
with
it
a
waft
from
the
feeling
of
the
old
times
sweet
as
long
as
life
lasts
and
sorrowful
things
may
be
associated
too
said
ellen
yes
and
sorrowful
things
but
this
power
of
association
is
the
cause
of
half
the
pleasure
we
enjoy
there
is
a
tune
my
mother
used
to
sing
i
can
not
hear
it
now
without
being
carried
swiftly
back
to
my
boyish
days
to
the
very
spirit
of
the
time
i
myself
spring
over
the
green
sward
as
i
did
then
oh
i
know
that
is
true
said
ellen
the
camellia
the
white
camellia
you
know
i
like
it
so
much
ever
since
what
you
said
about
it
one
day
i
never
see
it
without
thinking
of
it
and
it
would
not
seem
half
so
beautiful
but
for
that
what
did
i
say
about
it
do
you
remember
you
said
it
was
like
what
you
ought
to
be
and
what
you
should
be
if
you
ever
reached
heaven
and
you
repeated
that
verse
in
the
revelation
about
that
have
not
defiled
their
garments
i
always
think
of
it
it
seems
to
give
me
a
lesson
how
eloquent
of
beautiful
lessons
all
nature
would
be
to
us
said
john
musingly
if
we
had
but
the
eye
and
ear
to
take
them
in
and
in
that
way
you
would
heap
associations
upon
associations
yes
till
our
storehouse
of
pleasure
was
very
full
you
do
that
now
said
ellen
i
wish
you
would
teach
me
i
have
read
precious
things
sometimes
in
the
bunches
of
flowers
you
are
so
fond
of
ellie
can
not
you
i
do
know
i
only
think
of
themselves
except
sometimes
they
make
me
think
of
alice
you
know
from
any
works
we
may
form
some
judgment
of
the
mind
and
character
of
their
author
from
their
writings
i
know
you
can
said
ellen
from
what
other
works
from
any
which
are
not
mechanical
from
any
in
which
the
mind
not
the
hand
has
been
the
creating
power
i
saw
you
very
much
interested
the
other
day
in
the
eddystone
lighthouse
did
it
help
you
to
form
no
opinion
of
mr
smeaton
why
yes
certainly
said
ellen
i
admired
him
exceedingly
for
his
cleverness
and
perseverance
but
what
other
works
i
ca
think
of
any
there
is
the
lighthouse
that
is
one
thing
what
do
you
think
of
the
ocean
waves
that
now
and
then
overwhelm
it
ellen
half
shuddered
i
should
like
to
go
to
sea
john
but
you
were
speaking
of
men
works
and
women
works
well
women
works
i
can
not
help
forming
some
notion
of
a
lady
mind
and
character
from
the
way
she
dresses
herself
can
you
do
you
i
can
not
help
doing
it
many
things
appear
in
the
style
of
a
dress
that
she
never
dreams
of
the
style
of
her
thoughts
among
others
it
is
a
pity
ladies
did
know
that
said
ellen
laughing
they
would
be
very
careful
it
would
mend
the
matter
ellie
that
is
one
of
the
things
in
which
people
are
obliged
to
speak
truth
as
the
mind
is
so
it
will
show
itself
but
we
have
got
a
great
way
from
the
flowers
said
ellen
you
shall
bring
me
some
ellie
and
we
will
read
them
together
there
are
plenty
over
there
now
said
ellen
looking
towards
the
little
which
was
as
full
and
as
flourishing
as
ever
but
we
ca
see
them
well
by
this
light
a
bunch
of
flowers
seems
to
bring
me
very
near
the
hand
that
made
them
they
are
the
work
of
his
fingers
and
i
can
not
consider
them
without
being
joyfully
assured
of
the
glory
and
loveliness
of
their
creator
it
is
written
as
plainly
to
me
in
their
delicate
painting
and
sweet
breath
and
curious
structure
as
in
the
very
pages
of
the
bible
though
no
doubt
without
the
bible
i
could
not
read
the
flowers
i
never
thought
much
of
that
said
ellen
and
then
you
find
particular
lessons
in
particular
flowers
sometimes
oh
come
here
said
ellen
pulling
him
towards
the
and
tell
me
what
this
daphne
is
like
you
need
not
see
that
only
smell
it
that
enough
do
john
and
tell
me
what
it
is
like
he
smiled
as
he
complied
with
her
request
and
walked
away
again
well
what
is
it
said
ellen
i
know
you
have
thought
of
something
it
is
like
the
fragrance
that
christian
society
sometimes
leaves
upon
the
spirit
when
it
is
just
what
it
ought
to
be
my
mr
marshman
exclaimed
ellen
john
smiled
again
i
thought
of
him
ellie
and
i
thought
also
of
cowper
lines
one
who
holds
communion
with
the
skies
has
filled
his
urn
where
those
pure
waters
rise
descends
and
dwells
among
us
meaner
things
it
is
as
if
an
angel
shook
his
wings
ellie
was
silent
a
moment
from
pleasure
well
i
have
got
an
association
now
with
the
daphne
she
said
joyously
and
presently
added
sighing
how
much
you
see
in
everything
that
i
do
not
see
at
all
time
ellie
said
john
there
must
be
time
for
that
it
will
come
time
is
cried
out
upon
as
a
great
thief
it
is
people
own
fault
use
him
but
well
and
you
will
get
from
his
hand
more
than
he
will
ever
take
from
you
ellen
thoughts
travelled
on
a
little
way
from
this
speech
and
then
came
a
sigh
of
some
burden
as
it
seemed
and
her
face
was
softly
laid
against
the
arm
she
held
let
us
leave
all
that
to
god
said
john
gently
ellen
started
how
did
you
know
how
could
you
know
what
i
was
thinking
of
perhaps
my
thoughts
took
the
same
road
said
he
smiling
but
ellie
dear
let
us
look
to
that
one
source
of
happiness
that
can
never
be
dried
up
it
is
not
safe
to
count
upon
anything
else
it
is
not
wonderful
said
ellen
in
a
tremulous
voice
if
i
it
is
not
wonderful
ellie
nor
wrong
but
we
who
look
up
to
god
as
our
father
who
rejoice
in
christ
our
saviour
we
are
happy
whatever
beside
we
may
gain
or
lose
let
us
trust
him
and
never
doubt
that
ellie
but
still
said
ellen
but
still
we
will
hope
and
pray
alike
in
that
matter
and
while
we
do
and
may
with
our
whole
hearts
let
us
leave
ourselves
in
our
father
hand
the
joy
of
the
knowledge
of
christ
the
joy
the
world
can
not
intermeddle
with
the
peace
it
can
not
take
away
let
us
make
that
our
own
ellie
and
for
the
rest
put
away
all
anxious
care
about
what
we
can
not
control
ellen
hand
however
did
not
just
then
lie
quite
so
lightly
on
his
arm
as
it
did
a
few
minutes
ago
he
could
feel
that
and
could
see
the
glitter
of
one
or
two
tears
in
the
moonlight
as
they
fell
the
hand
was
fondly
taken
in
his
and
as
they
slowly
paced
up
and
down
he
went
on
in
low
tones
of
kindness
and
cheerfulness
with
his
pleasant
talk
till
she
was
too
happy
in
the
present
to
be
anxious
about
the
future
looked
up
again
and
brightly
into
his
face
and
questions
and
answers
came
as
gaily
as
ever
chapter
xlvi
who
knows
what
may
happen
patience
and
shuffle
the
cards
perhaps
after
all
i
shall
some
day
go
to
rome
and
come
back
peter
longfellow
the
rest
of
the
winter
or
rather
the
early
part
of
the
spring
passed
happily
away
march
at
thirlwall
seemed
more
to
belong
to
the
former
than
the
latter
then
spring
came
in
good
earnest
april
and
may
brought
warm
days
and
wild
flowers
ellen
refreshed
herself
and
adorned
the
room
with
quantities
of
them
and
as
soon
as
might
be
she
set
about
restoring
the
garden
john
was
not
fond
of
gardening
he
provided
her
with
all
manner
of
tools
ordered
whatever
work
she
wanted
to
be
done
for
her
supplied
her
with
new
plants
and
seeds
and
roots
and
was
always
ready
to
give
her
his
help
in
any
operations
or
press
of
business
that
called
for
it
but
for
the
most
part
ellen
hoed
and
raked
and
transplanted
and
sowed
seeds
while
he
walked
or
read
often
giving
his
counsel
indeed
asked
and
unasked
and
always
coming
in
between
her
and
any
difficult
or
heavy
job
the
hours
thus
spent
were
to
ellen
hours
of
unmixed
delight
when
he
did
not
choose
to
go
himself
he
sent
thomas
with
her
as
the
garden
was
some
little
distance
down
the
mountain
away
from
the
house
and
from
everybody
he
never
allowed
her
to
go
there
alone
as
if
to
verify
van
brunt
remark
that
something
is
always
happening
most
years
about
the
middle
of
may
there
came
letters
that
after
all
determined
john
going
abroad
the
sudden
death
of
two
relatives
one
after
the
other
had
left
the
family
estate
to
humphreys
it
required
the
personal
attendance
either
of
himself
or
his
son
he
could
not
therefore
his
son
must
go
once
on
the
other
side
the
atlantic
john
thought
it
best
his
going
should
fulfil
all
the
ends
for
which
both
humphreys
and
marshman
had
desired
it
this
would
occasion
his
stay
to
be
prolonged
to
at
least
a
year
probably
more
and
he
must
set
off
without
delay
in
the
midst
not
of
his
hurry
for
john
seldom
was
or
seemed
to
be
in
a
hurry
about
anything
but
in
the
midst
of
his
business
he
took
special
care
of
everything
that
concerned
or
could
possibly
concern
ellen
he
arranged
what
books
she
could
read
what
studies
she
could
carry
on
and
directed
that
about
these
matters
as
well
as
about
all
others
she
should
keep
up
a
constant
communication
with
him
by
letter
he
requested
chauncey
to
see
that
she
wanted
nothing
and
to
act
as
her
general
guardian
in
all
minor
things
respecting
which
humphreys
could
be
expected
to
take
no
thought
whatever
and
what
ellen
thanked
him
for
most
of
all
he
found
time
for
all
his
wonted
rides
and
she
thought
more
than
his
wonted
talks
with
her
endeavouring
as
he
well
knew
how
both
to
strengthen
and
cheer
her
mind
in
view
of
his
long
absence
the
memory
of
those
hours
never
went
from
her
the
family
at
ventnor
were
exceeding
desirous
that
she
should
make
one
of
them
during
all
the
time
john
should
be
gone
they
urged
it
with
every
possible
argument
ellen
said
little
but
he
knew
she
did
not
wish
it
and
finally
compounded
the
matter
by
arranging
that
she
should
stay
at
the
parsonage
through
the
summer
and
spend
the
winter
at
ventnor
sharing
all
ellen
chauncey
advantages
of
every
kind
ellen
was
all
the
more
pleased
with
this
arrangement
that
george
marshman
would
be
at
home
the
church
john
had
been
serving
were
becoming
exceedingly
attached
to
him
and
would
by
no
means
hear
of
giving
him
up
and
george
engaged
if
possible
to
supply
his
place
while
he
should
be
away
ellen
chauncey
was
in
ecstasies
and
it
was
further
promised
that
the
summer
should
not
pass
without
as
many
visits
on
both
sides
as
could
well
be
brought
about
ellen
had
the
comfort
at
the
last
of
hearing
john
say
that
she
had
behaved
unexceptionably
well
where
he
knew
it
was
difficult
for
her
to
behave
well
at
all
that
a
comfort
from
him
whose
notions
of
unexceptionable
behaviour
she
knew
were
remarkably
high
but
the
parting
after
all
was
a
dreadfully
hard
matter
though
softened
as
much
as
it
could
be
at
the
time
and
rendered
very
sweet
to
memory
by
the
tenderness
gentleness
and
kindness
with
which
her
brother
without
checking
soothed
her
grief
he
was
to
go
early
in
the
morning
and
he
made
ellen
take
leave
of
him
the
night
before
but
he
was
in
no
hurry
to
send
her
away
and
when
at
length
he
told
her
it
was
very
late
and
she
rose
up
to
go
he
went
with
her
to
the
very
door
of
her
room
and
there
bade
her
how
the
next
days
passed
ellen
hardly
knew
they
were
unspeakably
long
not
a
week
after
one
morning
nancy
vawse
came
into
the
kitchen
and
asked
in
her
blunt
fashion
is
ellen
montgomery
at
home
i
believe
miss
ellen
is
in
the
parlour
said
margery
dryly
i
want
to
speak
to
her
margery
silently
went
across
the
hall
to
the
miss
ellen
dear
she
said
softly
here

that
nancy
girl
wanting
to
speak
with
you
will
you
please
to
see
her
ellen
eagerly
desired
margery
to
let
her
in
by
no
means
displeased
to
have
some
interruption
to
the
sorrowful
thoughts
she
could
not
banish
she
received
nancy
very
kindly
well
i
declare
ellen
said
that
young
lady
whose
wandering
eye
was
upon
everything
but
ellen
herself
ai

your
fingers

file

ellen

times

nancy

a
little
as

herself

of

sphere

did
know
as
you
would
care
to

me

to

but
i

to
her
i

done
it
or

of
it
either
but
you
ai
like
anybody
else
look
here
said
she
tapping
her
apron
gently
with
one
finger
and
slowly
marking
off
each
word
this
came
out
of
your
aunt
box
in
the
closet
upstairs
in
her
room
nancy
ay
nancy
there
it
is
now
you
look
alter
it
ellen
where
it
was
if
you
look
till
but
how
came
you
there
i
wanted
to
amuse
myself
i
tell
you
partly
to
please
myself
and
partly
because
van
would
be
so
mad
if
she
knew
it
oh
nancy
well
i
do
say
it
was
right
but
anyhow
i
did
it
you
heard
what
i
found
yet
you
had
better
put
it
right
back
again
nancy
the
first
time
you
have
a
chance
put
it
back
again
i
give
it
to
you
and
then
may
put
it
back
again
if
you
have
a
mind
i
should
like
to
see
you
why
you
do
know
what
i
found
well
what
did
you
find
the
box
was
chuck
full
of
all
sorts
of
things
and
i
had
a
mind
to
see
what
was
in
it
so
i
pulled
out
one
after
the
other
till
i
got
to
the
bottom
at
the
very
bottom
was
some
letters
and
papers
and
there
staring
right
in
my
face
the
first
thing
i
see
was
ellen
montgomery
oh
nancy
screamed
ellen
a
letter
for
me
hush
and
sit
down
will
you
yes
a
whole
package
of
letters
for
you
well
thought
i
van
has
no
right
to
that
anyhow
and
she
ai
agoing
to
take
the
care
of
it
any
more
so
i
just
took
it
up
and
put
it
in
the
bosom
of
my
frock
while
i
looked
to
see
if
there
was
any
more
for
you
but
there
war
there
it
is
and
she
tossed
the
package
into
ellen
lap
ellen
head
swam
well
said
nancy
rising
i
may
go
now
i
suppose
and
no
thanks
to
me
yes
i
do
i
do
thank
you
very
much
nancy
cried
ellen
starting
up
and
taking
her
by
the
hand
i
do
thank
you
though
it
was
right
but
oh
how
could
she
how
could
she
dear
me
said
nancy
to
ask
that
of
van
she
could
do
anything
she
did
it
ai
so
easy
to
tell
ellen
bewildered
scarcely
knew
only
that
nancy
had
gone
the
outer
cover
of
her
package
the
seal
of
which
was
broken
contained
three
letters
two
addressed
to
ellen
in
her
father
hand
the
third
to
another
person
the
seals
of
these
had
not
been
broken
the
first
that
ellen
opened
she
saw
was
all
in
the
same
hand
with
the
direction
she
threw
it
down
and
eagerly
tried
the
other
and
yes
there
was
indeed
the
beloved
character
of
which
she
never
thought
to
have
seen
another
specimen
ellen
heart
swelled
with
many
feelings
thankfulness
tenderness
joy
and
sorrow
past
and
present
letter
was
not
thrown
down
but
grasped
while
tears
fell
much
too
fast
for
eyes
to
do
their
work
it
was
long
before
she
could
get
far
in
the
letter
but
when
she
had
fairly
begun
it
she
went
on
swiftly
and
almost
breathlessly
to
the
end
my
dear
dear
little
ellen
i
am
scarcely
able
but
i
must
write
to
you
once
more
more
daughter
for
it
is
not
permitted
me
to
see
your
face
again
in
this
world
i
look
to
see
it
my
dear
child
where
it
will
be
fairer
than
ever
here
it
seemed
even
to
me
i
shall
die
in
this
hope
and
expectation
ellen
remember
it
your
last
letters
have
greatly
encouraged
and
rejoiced
me
i
am
comforted
and
can
leave
you
quietly
in
that
hand
that
has
led
me
and
i
believe
is
leading
you
god
bless
you
my
child
ellen
i
have
a
mother
living
and
she
wishes
to
receive
you
as
her
own
when
i
am
gone
it
is
best
you
should
know
at
once
why
i
never
spoke
to
you
of
her
after
your
aunt
bessy
married
and
went
to
new
york
it
displeased
and
grieved
my
mother
greatly
that
i
too
who
had
always
been
her
favourite
child
should
leave
her
for
an
american
home
and
when
i
persisted
in
spite
of
all
that
entreaties
and
authority
could
urge
she
said
she
forgave
me
for
destroying
all
her
prospects
of
happiness
but
that
after
i
should
be
married
and
gone
she
should
consider
me
as
lost
to
her
entirely
and
so
i
must
consider
myself
she
never
wrote
to
me
and
i
never
wrote
to
her
after
i
reached
america
she
was
dead
to
me
i
do
not
say
that
i
did
not
deserve
it
but
i
have
written
to
her
lately
and
she
has
written
to
me
she
permits
me
to
die
in
the
joy
of
being
entirely
forgiven
and
in
the
further
joy
of
knowing
that
the
only
source
of
care
i
had
left
is
done
away
she
will
take
you
to
her
heart
to
the
place
i
once
filled
and
i
believe
fill
yet
she
longs
to
have
you
and
to
have
you
as
entirely
her
own
in
all
respects
and
to
this
in
consideration
of
the
wandering
life
your
father
leads
and
will
lead
i
am
willing
and
he
is
willing
to
agree
it
is
arranged
so
the
old
happy
home
of
my
childhood
will
be
yours
my
ellen
it
joys
me
to
think
of
it
your
father
will
write
to
your
aunt
and
to
you
on
the
subject
and
furnish
you
with
funds
it
is
our
desire
that
you
should
take
advantage
of
the
very
first
opportunity
of
proper
persons
going
to
scotland
who
will
be
willing
to
take
charge
of
you
your
dear
friends
and
miss
humphreys
will
i
dare
say
help
you
in
this
to
them
i
could
say
much
if
i
had
strength
but
words
are
little
if
blessings
and
prayers
from
a
full
heart
are
worth
anything
they
are
the
richer
my
love
and
gratitude
to
them
can
not
the
writer
had
failed
here
and
what
there
was
of
the
letter
had
evidently
been
written
at
different
times
captain
montgomery
was
to
the
same
purpose
he
directed
ellen
to
embrace
the
first
opportunity
of
suitable
guardians
to
cross
the
atlantic
and
repair
to
george
street
edinburgh
and
that
miss
fortune
would
give
her
the
money
she
would
need
which
he
had
written
to
her
to
do
and
that
the
accompanying
letter
ellen
was
to
carry
with
her
and
deliver
to
lindsay
her
grandmother
ellen
felt
as
if
her
head
would
split
she
took
up
that
letter
gazed
at
the
strange
name
and
direction
which
had
taken
such
new
and
startling
interest
for
her
wondered
over
the
thought
of
what
she
was
ordered
to
do
with
it
marvelled
what
sort
of
fingers
they
were
which
would
open
it
or
whether
it
would
ever
be
opened
and
finally
in
a
perfect
maze
unable
to
read
think
or
even
weep
she
carried
her
package
of
letters
into
her
own
room
the
room
that
had
been
alice
laid
herself
on
the
bed
and
them
beside
her
and
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
she
woke
up
towards
evening
with
the
pressure
of
a
mountain
weight
upon
her
mind
her
thoughts
and
feelings
were
a
maze
still
and
not
humphreys
himself
could
be
more
grave
and
abstracted
than
poor
ellen
was
that
night
so
many
points
were
to
be
settled
so
many
questions
answered
to
herself
it
was
a
good
while
before
ellen
could
disentangle
them
and
know
what
she
did
think
and
feel
and
what
she
would
do
she
very
soon
found
out
her
own
mind
upon
one
subject
she
would
be
exceeding
sorry
to
be
obliged
to
obey
the
directions
in
the
letters
but
must
she
obey
them
i
have
promised
alice
thought
ellen
i
have
promised
humphreys
i
ca
be
adopted
twice
and
this
lindsay
my
grandmother
she
can
not
be
nice
or
she
would
have
treated
my
mother
so
she
can
not
be
a
nice
person
hard
she
must
be
hard
i
never
want
to
see
her
my
mother
but
then
my
mother
loved
her
and
was
very
glad
to
have
me
go
to
her
oh
oh
how
could
she
how
could
they
do
so
when
they
did
know
how
it
might
be
with
me
and
what
dear
friends
they
might
make
me
leave
oh
it
was
cruel
but
then
they
did
know
that
is
the
very
thing
they
thought
i
would
have
nobody
but
aunt
fortune
and
so
it
no
wonder
oh
what
shall
i
do
what
i
to
do
these
people
in
scotland
must
have
given
me
up
by
this
time
it
let
me
see
it
just
about
three
years
now
a
little
less
since
these
letters
were
written
and
circumstances
are
changed
i
have
a
home
and
a
father
and
a
brother
may
i
not
judge
for
myself
but
my
mother
and
my
father
have
ordered
me
what
shall
i
do
if
john
were
only
here
but
perhaps
he
would
make
me
go
he
might
think
it
right
and
to
leave
him
and
maybe
never
to
see
him
again
and
humphreys
and
how
lonely
he
would
be
without
me
i
can
not
i
will
not
oh
what
i
do
what
shall
i
do
ellen
meditations
gradually
plunged
her
in
despair
for
she
could
not
look
at
the
event
of
being
obliged
to
go
and
she
could
not
get
rid
of
the
feeling
that
perhaps
it
might
come
to
that
she
wept
bitterly
it
did
mend
the
matter
she
thought
painfully
fearfully
long
and
was
no
nearer
an
end
she
could
not
endure
to
submit
the
matter
to
humphreys
she
feared
his
decision
and
she
feared
also
that
he
would
give
her
the
money
miss
fortune
had
failed
to
supply
for
the
journey
how
much
it
might
be
ellen
had
no
idea
she
could
not
dismiss
the
subject
as
decided
by
circumstances
for
conscience
pricked
her
with
the
fifth
commandment
she
was
miserable
it
happily
occurred
to
her
at
last
to
take
counsel
with
vawse
this
might
be
done
she
knew
without
betraying
nancy
vawse
was
much
too
honourable
to
press
her
as
to
how
she
came
by
the
letters
and
her
word
could
easily
be
obtained
not
to
speak
of
the
affairs
to
any
one
as
for
miss
fortune
conduct
it
must
be
made
known
there
was
no
help
for
that
so
it
was
settled
and
ellen
breast
was
a
little
lightened
of
its
load
of
care
for
that
time
she
had
leisure
to
think
of
some
other
things
why
had
miss
fortune
kept
back
the
letters
ellen
guessed
pretty
well
but
she
did
not
know
quite
all
the
package
with
its
accompanying
despatch
to
miss
fortune
had
arrived
shortly
after
ellen
first
heard
the
news
of
her
mother
death
when
she
was
refuged
with
alice
at
the
parsonage
at
the
time
of
its
being
sent
captain
montgomery
movements
were
extremely
uncertain
and
in
obedience
to
the
earnest
request
of
his
wife
he
directed
that
without
waiting
for
his
own
return
ellen
should
immediately
set
out
for
scotland
part
of
the
money
for
her
expenses
he
sent
the
rest
he
desired
his
sister
to
furnish
promising
to
make
all
straight
when
he
should
come
home
but
it
happened
that
he
was
already
this
lady
debtor
in
a
small
amount
which
miss
fortune
had
serious
doubts
of
ever
being
repaid
she
instantly
determined
that
if
she
had
once
been
a
fool
in
lending
him
money
she
would
not
a
second
time
in
adding
to
the
sum
if
he
wanted
to
send
his
daughter
on
a
chase
after
great
relations
he
might
come
home
himself
and
see
to
it
it
was
none
of
her
business
quietly
taking
the
remittance
to
refund
his
own
owing
she
of
course
threw
the
letters
into
her
box
as
the
delivery
of
them
would
expose
the
whole
transaction
there
they
lay
till
nancy
found
them
early
next
morning
after
breakfast
ellen
came
into
the
kitchen
and
begged
margery
to
ask
thomas
to
bring
the
brownie
to
the
door
surprised
at
the
energy
in
her
tone
and
manner
margery
gave
the
message
and
added
that
miss
ellen
seemed
to
have
picked
up
wonderfully
she
heard
her
speak
so
brisk
since
john
went
away
the
brownie
was
soon
at
the
door
but
not
so
soon
as
ellen
who
had
dressed
in
feverish
haste
the
brownie
was
not
alone
there
was
old
john
saddled
and
bridled
and
thomas
grimes
in
waiting
it
not
necessary
for
you
to
take
that
trouble
thomas
said
ellen
i
do
mind
going
alone
at
all
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
ellen
thomas
touched
his
hat
but
john
left
particular
orders
that
i
was
to
go
with
miss
ellen
whenever
it
pleased
her
to
ride
never
failing
did
he
said
ellen
but
is
it
convenient
for
you
now
thomas
i
want
to
go
as
far
as
mrs
vawse
it
always
convenient
miss
ellen
always
miss
ellen
need
not
think
of
that
at
all
i
am
always
ready
ellen
mounted
upon
the
brownie
sighing
for
the
want
of
the
hand
that
used
to
lift
her
to
the
saddle
and
spurred
by
this
recollection
set
off
at
a
round
pace
soon
she
was
at
vawse
and
soon
finding
her
alone
ellen
had
spread
out
all
her
difficulties
before
her
and
given
her
the
letters
to
read
vawse
readily
promised
to
speak
on
the
subject
to
no
one
without
ellen
leave
her
suspicions
fell
upon
van
brunt
not
her
she
heard
all
the
story
and
read
the
letters
before
making
any
remark
now
dear
vawse
said
ellen
anxiously
when
the
last
one
was
folded
up
and
laid
on
the
table
what
do
you
think
i
think
my
child
you
must
go
said
the
old
lady
steadily
ellen
looked
keenly
as
if
to
find
some
other
answer
in
her
face
her
own
changing
more
and
more
for
a
minute
till
she
sunk
it
in
her
hands
cela
vous
donne
beaucoup
de
chagrin
je
le
vois
bien
said
the
old
lady
tenderly
their
conversations
were
always
in
vawse
tongue
but
said
ellen
presently
lifting
her
head
again
there
were
no
tears
i
can
not
go
without
money
that
can
be
obtained
without
any
difficulty
from
whom
i
can
not
ask
aunt
fortune
for
it
vawse
i
could
not
do
it
there
is
no
difficulty
about
the
money
show
your
letters
to
mr
humphreys
oh
i
can
not
said
ellen
covering
her
face
again
will
you
let
me
do
it
i
will
speak
to
him
if
you
permit
me
but
what
use
ought
not
to
give
me
the
money
vawse
it
would
not
be
right
and
to
show
him
the
letters
would
be
like
asking
him
for
it
oh
i
ca
bear
to
do
that
he
would
give
it
you
ellen
with
the
greatest
pleasure
oh
no
vawse
said
ellen
bursting
into
tears
he
would
never
be
pleased
to
send
me
away
from
him
i
know
i
know
he
would
miss
me
oh
what
shall
i
do
not
my
dear
ellen
said
the
old
lady
coming
to
her
and
gently
stroking
her
head
with
both
hands
you
must
do
what
is
and
you
know
it
can
not
be
but
that
will
be
best
and
happiest
for
you
in
the
end
oh
i
wish
i
wish
exclaimed
ellen
from
the
bottom
of
her
heart
those
letters
had
never
been
found
nay
ellen
is
not
right
but
i
promised
alice
vawse
ought
i
go
away
and
leave
him
oh
vawse
it
is
very
hard
i
your
father
and
your
mother
have
said
it
my
child
but
they
never
would
have
said
it
if
they
had
known
but
they
did
not
know
ellen
and
here
it
is
ellen
wept
violently
regardless
of
the
caresses
and
soothing
words
which
her
old
friend
lavished
upon
her
there
is
one
thing
said
she
at
last
raising
her
head
i
do
know
of
anybody
going
to
scotland
and
i
am
not
likely
to
and
if
i
only
do
not
before
autumn
that
is
not
a
good
time
to
go
and
then
comes
winter
my
dear
ellen
said
vawse
sorrowfully
i
must
drive
you
from
your
last
hope
do
you
know
that
gillespie
is
going
abroad
with
all
her
family
next
month
i
think
ellen
grew
pale
for
a
minute
and
sat
holding
bitter
counsel
with
her
own
heart
vawse
hardly
knew
what
to
say
next
you
need
not
feel
uneasy
about
your
journeying
expenses
she
remarked
after
a
pause
you
can
easily
repay
them
if
you
wish
when
you
reach
your
friends
in
scotland
ellen
did
not
hear
her
she
looked
up
with
an
odd
expression
of
determination
in
her
face
determination
taking
its
stand
upon
difficulties
i
sha
stay
there
vawse
if
i
go
i
shall
go
i
suppose
if
i
must
but
do
you
think
anything
will
keep
me
there
never
you
will
stay
for
the
same
reason
that
you
go
for
ellen
to
do
your
duty
yes
till
i
am
old
enough
to
choose
for
myself
vawse
and
then
i
shall
come
back
if
they
will
let
me
whom
do
you
mean
by
humphreys
and
mr
john
my
dear
ellen
said
the
old
lady
kindly
be
satisfied
with
doing
your
duty
now
leave
the
future
while
you
follow
him
god
will
be
your
friend
is
not
that
enough
and
all
things
shall
work
for
your
good
you
do
not
know
what
you
will
wish
when
the
time
comes
you
speak
of
you
do
not
know
what
new
friends
you
may
find
to
love
ellen
had
in
her
own
heart
the
warrant
for
what
she
had
said
and
what
she
saw
by
her
smile
vawse
doubted
but
she
disdained
to
assert
what
she
could
bring
nothing
to
prove
she
took
a
sorrowful
leave
of
her
old
friend
and
returned
home
after
dinner
when
humphreys
was
about
going
back
to
his
study
ellen
timidly
stopped
him
and
gave
him
her
letters
and
asked
him
to
look
at
them
sometime
when
he
had
leisure
she
told
him
also
where
they
were
found
and
how
long
they
had
lain
there
and
that
vawse
had
said
she
ought
to
show
them
to
him
she
guessed
he
would
read
them
at
once
and
she
waited
with
a
beating
heart
in
a
little
while
she
heard
his
step
coming
back
along
the
hall
he
came
and
sat
down
by
her
on
the
sofa
and
took
her
hand
what
is
your
wish
in
this
matter
my
child
he
said
gravely
and
cheerfully
ellen
look
answered
that
i
will
do
whatever
you
say
i
must
sir
she
said
faintly
i
dare
not
ask
myself
what
would
wish
ellen
the
matter
is
taken
out
of
our
hands
you
must
do
your
parents
will
my
child
i
will
try
to
hope
that
you
will
gain
more
than
i
lose
as
the
lord
pleases
if
i
am
bereaved
of
my
children
i
am
bereaved
gillespie
he
said
after
a
pause
is
about
going
to
england
i
know
not
how
soon
it
will
be
best
for
you
to
see
her
at
once
and
make
all
arrangements
that
may
be
necessary
i
will
go
with
you
to
ventnor
if
the
day
be
a
good
one
there
was
something
ellen
longed
to
say
but
it
was
impossible
to
get
it
out
she
could
not
utter
a
word
she
had
pressed
her
hands
upon
her
face
to
try
to
keep
herself
quiet
but
humphreys
could
see
the
deep
crimson
flushing
to
the
very
roots
of
her
hair
he
drew
her
close
within
his
arms
for
a
moment
kissed
her
forehead
ellen
it
was
sadly
and
went
away
it
was
well
she
did
not
hear
him
sigh
as
he
went
back
along
the
hall
it
was
well
she
did
not
see
the
face
of
more
settled
gravity
with
which
he
sat
down
to
his
writing
she
had
enough
of
her
own
they
went
to
ventnor
gillespie
with
great
pleasure
undertook
the
charge
of
her
and
promised
to
deliver
her
safely
to
her
friends
in
scotland
it
was
arranged
that
she
should
go
back
to
thirlwall
to
make
her
adieus
and
that
in
a
week
or
two
a
carriage
should
be
sent
to
bring
her
to
ventnor
where
her
preparations
for
the
journey
should
be
made
and
whence
the
whole
party
would
set
off
so
you
are
going
to
be
a
scotchwoman
after
all
ellen
said
miss
sophia
i
had
a
great
deal
rather
be
an
american
miss
sophia
why
hutchinson
will
tell
you
said
the
young
lady
that
it
is
infinitely
more
desirable
to
be
a
scotchwoman
than
that
ellen
face
however
looked
so
little
inclined
to
be
merry
that
she
took
up
the
subject
in
another
tone
seriously
do
you
know
said
she
i
have
been
thinking
it
is
a
very
happy
thing
for
you
i
do
know
what
would
become
of
you
alone
in
that
great
parsonage
house
you
would
mope
yourself
to
death
in
a
little
while
especially
now
that
john
is
gone
he
will
be
back
said
ellen
yes
but
what
if
he
is
he
ca
stay
at
thirlwall
child
he
live
thirty
miles
from
his
church
you
know
did
you
think
he
would
they
think
all
the
world
of
him
already
i
expect
they
barely
put
up
with
george
while
he
is
gone
they
will
want
john
all
to
themselves
when
he
comes
back
you
may
rely
on
that
what
you
thinking
of
child
for
ellen
eyes
were
sparkling
with
two
or
three
thoughts
which
miss
sophia
could
not
read
i
should
like
to
know
what
you
are
smiling
at
she
said
with
some
curiosity
but
the
smile
was
almost
immediately
quenched
in
tears
notwithstanding
miss
sophia
discouraging
talk
ellen
privately
agreed
with
ellen
chauncey
that
the
brownie
should
be
sent
to
her
to
keep
and
use
as
her
own
his
mistress
should
come
both
children
being
entirely
of
opinion
that
the
arrangement
was
a
most
unexceptionable
one
it
was
not
forgotten
that
the
lapse
of
three
years
since
the
date
of
the
letters
left
some
uncertainty
as
to
the
present
state
of
affairs
among
ellen
friends
in
scotland
but
this
doubt
was
not
thought
sufficient
to
justify
her
letting
pass
so
excellent
an
opportunity
of
making
the
journey
especially
as
captain
montgomery
letter
spoke
of
an
to
whom
equally
with
her
grandmother
ellen
was
to
be
consigned
in
case
circumstances
would
permit
it
gillespie
engaged
to
keep
ellen
with
her
and
bring
her
home
to
america
when
she
herself
should
return
and
in
little
more
than
a
month
they
were
gone
adieus
and
preparations
and
all
were
over
ellen
parting
with
vawse
was
very
tender
and
very
sad
with
van
brunt
extremely
and
gratefully
affectionate
on
both
sides
with
her
aunt
constrained
and
brief
with
margery
very
sorrowful
indeed
but
ellen
longest
and
most
lingering
adieu
was
to
captain
parry
the
old
grey
cat
for
one
whole
evening
she
sat
with
him
in
her
arms
and
over
poor
pussy
were
shed
the
tears
that
fell
for
many
better
loved
and
better
deserving
personages
as
well
as
those
not
a
few
that
were
wept
for
him
since
alice
death
parry
had
transferred
his
entire
confidence
and
esteem
to
ellen
whether
from
feeling
a
want
or
because
love
and
tenderness
had
taught
her
the
touch
and
the
tone
that
were
fitted
to
win
his
regard
only
john
shared
it
ellen
was
his
chief
favourite
and
almost
constant
companion
and
bitterer
tears
ellen
shed
at
no
time
than
that
evening
before
she
went
away
over
the
old
cat
she
could
not
distress
kitty
with
her
distress
nor
weary
him
with
the
calls
upon
his
sympathy
though
indeed
it
is
true
that
he
sundry
times
poked
his
nose
up
wonderingly
and
caressingly
in
her
face
she
had
no
remonstrance
or
interruption
to
fear
and
taking
pussy
as
the
emblem
and
representative
of
the
whole
household
ellen
wept
them
all
over
him
with
a
tenderness
and
a
bitterness
that
were
somehow
intensified
by
the
sight
of
the
grey
coat
and
white
paws
and
kindly
face
of
her
unconscious
old
brute
friend
the
old
people
at
were
taken
leave
of
the
brownie
too
with
great
difficulty
and
nancy
i
really
sorry
you
are
going
ellen
said
she
you
the
only
soul
in
town
i
care
about
i
wish
i
thrown
them
letters
in
the
fire
after
all
who
ha
thought
it
ellen
could
not
help
in
her
heart
echoing
the
wish
i
really
sorry
ellen
she
repeated
ai
there
something
i
can
do
for
you
when
you
are
gone
oh
yes
dear
nancy
said
ellen
weeping
if
you
would
only
take
care
of
your
dear
grandmother
she
is
left
alone
now
if
you
would
only
take
care
of
her
and
read
your
bible
and
be
good
nancy
oh
nancy
nancy
do
do
they
kissed
each
other
and
nancy
went
away
fairly
crying
marshman
own
woman
a
steady
excellent
person
had
come
in
the
carriage
for
ellen
and
the
next
morning
early
after
breakfast
when
everything
else
was
ready
she
went
into
humphreys
study
to
bid
the
last
dreaded
she
thought
her
obedience
was
costing
her
dear
it
was
nearly
a
silent
parting
he
held
her
a
long
time
in
his
arms
and
there
ellen
bitterly
thought
her
place
ought
to
be
what
have
i
to
do
to
seek
new
relations
she
said
to
herself
but
she
was
speechless
till
gently
relaxing
his
hold
he
tenderly
smoothed
back
her
disordered
hair
and
kissing
her
said
a
very
few
grave
words
of
blessing
and
counsel
ellen
gathered
all
her
strength
together
then
for
she
had
something
that
be
spoken
sir
said
she
falling
on
her
knees
before
him
and
looking
up
in
his
face
this
do
alter
you
do
not
take
back
what
you
said
do
you
what
that
i
said
my
child
that
said
ellen
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
on
his
knee
and
scarce
able
to
speak
with
great
effort
that
which
you
said
when
i
first
came
that
which
you
said
about
about
what
my
dear
child
my
going
away
do
change
anything
does
it
sir
may
i
come
back
if
ever
i
can
he
raised
her
up
and
drew
her
close
to
his
bosom
again
my
dear
little
daughter
said
he
you
can
not
be
so
glad
to
come
back
as
my
arms
and
my
heart
will
be
to
receive
you
i
scarce
dare
hope
to
see
that
day
but
all
in
this
house
is
yours
dear
ellen
as
well
when
in
scotland
as
here
i
take
back
nothing
my
daughter
nothing
is
changed
a
word
or
two
more
of
affection
and
blessing
which
ellen
was
utterly
unable
to
answer
in
any
way
and
she
went
to
the
carriage
with
one
drop
of
cordial
in
her
heart
that
she
fed
upon
a
long
while
he
called
me
his
daughter
he
never
said
that
before
since
alice
died
oh
so
i
will
be
as
long
as
i
live
if
i
find
fifty
new
relations
but
what
good
will
a
daughter
three
thousand
miles
off
do
him
chapter
xlvii
item
is
out
with
that
it
was
eve
legacy
and
can
not
be
from
her
shakespeare
the
voyage
was
peaceful
and
prosperous
in
due
time
the
whole
party
found
themselves
safe
in
london
ever
since
they
set
out
ellen
had
been
constantly
gaining
on
gillespie
good
will
the
major
hardly
saw
her
but
she
had
something
to
say
about
that
child
in
the
world
too
i
think
said
the
major
and
even
gillespie
owned
that
there
was
something
more
than
in
ellen
politeness
she
had
good
trial
of
it
gillespie
was
much
longer
ailing
than
any
of
the
party
and
when
ellen
got
well
it
was
her
great
pleasure
to
devote
herself
to
the
service
of
the
only
member
of
the
marshman
family
now
within
her
reach
she
could
never
do
too
much
she
watched
by
her
read
to
her
was
quick
to
see
and
perform
all
the
little
offices
of
attention
and
kindness
where
a
servant
hand
is
not
so
acceptable
and
withal
never
was
in
the
way
nor
put
herself
forward
gillespie
own
daughter
was
much
less
helpful
both
she
and
william
however
had
long
since
forgotten
the
old
grudge
and
treated
ellen
as
well
as
they
did
anybody
rather
better
major
gillespie
was
attentive
and
kind
as
possible
to
the
gentle
little
body
that
was
always
at
his
wife
pillow
and
even
lester
the
maid
told
one
of
her
friends
she
was
such
a
sweet
little
lady
that
it
was
a
pleasure
and
gratification
to
do
anything
for
her
lester
acted
this
out
and
in
her
kindly
disposition
ellen
found
very
substantial
comfort
and
benefit
throughout
the
voyage
gillespie
told
her
husband
she
should
be
rejoiced
if
it
turned
out
that
they
might
keep
ellen
with
them
and
carry
her
back
to
america
she
only
wished
it
were
not
for
humphreys
but
herself
as
their
destination
was
not
now
scotland
but
paris
it
was
proposed
to
write
to
ellen
friends
to
ascertain
whether
any
change
had
occurred
or
whether
they
still
wished
to
receive
her
this
however
was
rendered
unnecessary
they
were
scarcely
established
in
their
hotel
when
a
gentleman
from
edinburgh
an
intimate
friend
of
the
ventnor
family
and
whom
ellen
herself
had
more
than
once
met
there
came
to
see
them
gillespie
bethought
herself
to
make
inquiries
of
him
do
you
happen
to
know
a
family
of
lindsays
in
george
street
mr
dundas
lindsays
yes
perfectly
well
do
you
know
them
no
but
i
am
very
much
interested
in
one
of
the
family
is
the
old
lady
living
yes
certainly
not
very
old
either
not
above
sixty
or
and
as
hale
and
alert
as
at
forty
a
very
fine
old
lady
a
very
large
family
oh
no
lindsay
is
a
widower
this
some
years
with
no
children
and
there
is
a
widowed
daughter
lately
come
home
lady
keith
that
all
lindsay
that
is
the
son
yes
you
would
like
them
they
are
excellent
people
excellent
family
wealthy
beautiful
country
seat
on
the
south
bank
of
the
tyne
some
miles
out
of
edinburgh
i
was
down
there
two
weeks
ago
entertain
most
handsomely
and
agreeably
two
things
that
do
not
always
go
together
you
meet
a
pleasanter
circle
nowhere
than
at
lindsay
and
that
is
the
whole
family
said
gillespie
that
is
all
there
were
two
daughters
married
in
america
some
dozen
or
so
years
ago
lindsay
took
it
very
hard
i
believe
but
she
bore
up
and
bears
up
now
as
if
misfortune
had
never
crossed
her
path
though
the
death
of
lindsay
wife
and
son
was
another
great
blow
i
believe
there
is
a
grey
hair
on
her
head
at
this
moment
there
is
some
peculiarity
about
them
perhaps
some
pride
too
but
that
is
an
amiable
weakness
he
added
laughing
as
he
rose
to
go
gillespie
i
am
sure
will
not
find
fault
with
them
for
it
that
an
insinuation
dundas
but
look
here
what
i
am
bringing
to
lindsay
in
the
shape
of
a
granddaughter
what
my
old
acquaintance
miss
ellen
is
it
possible
my
dear
madam
if
you
had
such
a
treasure
for
sale
they
would
pour
half
their
fortune
into
your
lap
to
purchase
it
and
the
other
half
at
her
feet
i
would
not
take
it
mr
dundas
it
would
be
no
mean
price
i
assure
you
in
itself
however
it
might
be
comparatively
i
give
miss
ellen
joy
miss
ellen
took
none
of
his
giving
ah
ellen
my
dear
said
gillespie
when
he
was
gone
we
shall
never
have
you
back
in
america
again
i
give
up
all
hopes
of
it
why
do
you
look
so
solemn
my
love
you
are
a
strange
child
most
girls
would
be
delighted
at
such
a
prospect
opening
before
them
you
forget
what
i
leave
mrs
gillespie
so
will
you
my
love
in
a
few
days
though
i
love
you
for
remembering
so
well
those
that
have
been
kind
to
you
but
you
do
realise
yet
what
is
before
you
why
you
have
a
good
time
ellen
said
marianne
i
wonder
you
are
not
out
of
your
wits
with
joy
should
be
you
may
as
well
make
over
the
brownie
to
me
ellen
said
william
i
expect
you
never
want
him
again
i
can
not
you
know
william
i
lent
him
to
ellen
chauncey
him
that
a
good
one
for
how
long
ellen
smiled
though
sighing
inwardly
to
see
how
very
much
narrowed
was
her
prospect
of
ever
mounting
him
again
she
did
not
care
to
explain
herself
to
those
around
her
still
at
the
very
bottom
of
her
heart
lay
two
thoughts
in
which
her
hope
refuged
itself
one
was
a
peculiar
assurance
that
whatever
her
brother
pleased
nothing
could
hinder
him
from
accomplishing
the
other
a
like
confidence
that
it
would
not
please
him
to
leave
his
little
sister
unlooked
after
but
all
began
to
grow
misty
and
it
seemed
now
as
if
scotland
must
henceforth
be
the
limit
of
her
horizon
leaving
their
children
at
a
relation
house
major
and
gillespie
accompanied
her
to
the
north
they
travelled
post
and
arriving
in
the
evening
at
edinburgh
put
up
at
a
hotel
in
princes
street
it
was
agreed
that
ellen
should
not
seek
her
new
home
till
the
morrow
she
should
eat
one
more
supper
and
breakfast
with
her
old
friends
and
have
a
rest
first
she
was
very
glad
of
it
the
major
and
gillespie
were
enchanted
with
the
noble
view
from
their
parlour
windows
while
they
were
eagerly
conversing
together
ellen
sat
alone
at
the
other
window
looking
out
upon
the
curious
old
town
there
was
all
the
fascination
of
novelty
and
beauty
about
that
singular
picturesque
mass
of
buildings
in
its
sober
colouring
growing
more
sober
as
the
twilight
fell
and
just
before
outlines
were
lost
in
the
dusk
lights
began
feebly
to
twinkle
here
and
there
and
grew
brighter
and
more
as
the
night
came
on
till
their
brilliant
multitude
were
all
that
could
be
seen
where
the
curious
jumble
of
chimneys
and
and
crooked
ways
had
shown
a
little
before
ellen
sat
watching
this
lighting
up
of
the
old
town
feeling
strangely
that
she
was
in
the
midst
of
new
scenes
indeed
entering
upon
a
new
stage
of
life
and
having
some
difficulty
to
persuade
herself
that
she
was
really
ellen
montgomery
the
scene
of
extreme
beauty
before
her
seemed
rather
to
increase
the
confusion
and
sadness
of
her
mind
happily
joyfully
ellen
remembered
as
she
sat
gazing
over
the
darkening
city
and
its
brightening
lights
that
there
was
one
near
her
who
could
not
change
that
scotland
was
no
remove
from
him
that
his
providence
as
well
as
his
heaven
was
over
her
there
that
there
not
less
than
in
america
she
was
his
child
she
rejoiced
as
she
sat
in
her
dusky
window
over
his
words
of
assurance
i
am
the
good
shepherd
and
know
my
sheep
and
am
known
of
mine
and
she
looked
up
into
the
clear
sky
that
at
least
was
in
tearful
thankfulness
and
with
earnest
prayer
that
she
might
be
kept
from
evil
ellen
guessed
she
might
have
special
need
to
offer
that
prayer
and
as
again
her
eye
wandered
over
the
singular
bright
spectacle
that
kept
reminding
her
she
was
a
stranger
in
a
strange
place
her
heart
joyfully
leaned
upon
another
loved
sentence
this
god
is
our
god
for
ever
and
ever
he
will
be
our
guide
even
unto
death
she
was
called
from
her
window
to
supper
why
how
well
you
look
said
gillespie
i
expected
you
would
have
been
half
tired
to
death
does
she
look
well
as
if
she
was
neither
tired
hungry
nor
sleepy
said
major
gillespie
kindly
and
yet
she
must
be
all
three
ellen
was
all
three
but
she
had
the
rest
of
a
quiet
mind
in
the
same
quiet
mind
a
little
fluttered
and
anxious
now
she
set
out
in
the
the
next
morning
with
her
kind
friends
to
george
street
it
was
their
intention
after
leaving
her
to
go
straight
on
to
england
they
were
in
a
hurry
to
be
there
and
gillespie
judged
that
the
presence
of
a
stranger
at
the
meeting
between
ellen
and
her
new
relations
would
be
desired
by
none
of
the
parties
but
when
they
reached
the
house
they
found
the
family
were
not
at
home
they
were
in
the
country
at
their
place
on
the
tyne
the
direction
was
obtained
and
the
horses
heads
turned
that
way
after
a
drive
of
some
length
through
what
kind
of
a
country
ellen
could
hardly
have
told
they
arrived
at
the
place
it
was
beautifully
situated
and
through
grounds
they
drove
up
to
a
large
rather
house
the
ladies
were
at
home
and
that
ascertained
ellen
took
a
kind
leave
of
gillespie
shook
hands
with
the
major
at
the
door
and
was
left
alone
for
the
second
time
in
her
life
to
make
her
acquaintance
with
new
and
untried
friends
she
stood
for
one
second
looking
after
the
retreating
carriage
one
swift
thought
went
to
her
adopted
father
and
brother
far
away
one
to
her
friend
in
heaven
and
ellen
quietly
turned
to
the
servant
and
asked
for
lindsay
she
was
shown
into
a
large
room
where
nobody
was
and
sat
down
with
a
beating
heart
while
the
servant
went
upstairs
looking
with
a
strange
feeling
upon
what
was
to
be
her
future
home
the
house
was
handsome
comfortably
luxuriously
furnished
but
without
any
attempt
at
display
things
rather
than
otherwise
plain
even
homely
in
some
instances
yet
evidently
there
was
no
sparing
of
money
in
any
line
of
use
or
comfort
nor
were
reading
and
writing
painting
and
music
strangers
there
unconsciously
acting
upon
her
brother
principle
of
judging
of
people
from
their
works
ellen
from
what
she
saw
gathered
around
her
formed
a
favourable
opinion
of
her
relations
without
thinking
of
it
for
indeed
she
was
thinking
of
something
else
a
lady
presently
entered
and
said
that
lindsay
was
not
very
well
seeing
ellen
very
hesitating
look
she
added
shall
i
carry
her
any
message
for
you
this
lady
was
and
but
somehow
there
was
something
in
her
face
or
manner
that
encouraged
ellen
to
an
explanation
she
could
make
none
she
silently
gave
her
her
father
letter
with
which
the
lady
left
the
room
in
a
minute
or
two
she
returned
and
said
her
mother
would
see
ellen
upstairs
and
asked
her
to
come
with
her
this
then
must
be
lady
keith
but
no
sign
of
recognition
ellen
wondered
as
her
trembling
feet
carried
her
upstairs
and
to
the
door
of
a
room
where
the
lady
motioned
her
to
enter
she
did
not
follow
herself
a
large
pleasant
but
ellen
saw
nothing
but
the
dignified
figure
and
searching
glance
of
a
lady
in
black
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
at
the
look
which
instantly
followed
her
entering
however
ellen
sprang
forward
and
was
received
in
arms
that
folded
her
as
fondly
and
as
closely
as
ever
those
of
her
own
mother
had
done
without
releasing
her
from
their
clasp
lindsay
presently
sat
down
and
placing
ellen
on
her
lap
and
for
a
long
time
without
speaking
a
word
she
overwhelmed
her
with
caresses
caresses
often
interrupted
with
passionate
bursts
of
tears
ellen
herself
cried
heartily
for
company
though
lindsay
little
guessed
why
along
with
the
joy
and
tenderness
arising
from
the
finding
a
relation
that
so
much
loved
and
valued
her
and
along
with
the
sympathy
that
entered
into
thoughts
there
mixed
other
feelings
she
began
to
know
as
if
by
instinct
what
kind
of
a
person
her
grandmother
was
the
clasp
of
the
arms
that
were
about
her
said
as
plainly
as
possible
i
will
never
let
you
go
ellen
felt
it
she
did
not
know
in
her
confusion
whether
she
was
glad
or
most
sorry
and
this
uncertainty
mightily
helped
the
flow
of
her
tears
when
this
scene
had
lasted
some
time
lindsay
began
with
the
utmost
tenderness
to
take
off
ellen
gloves
her
cape
her
bonnet
had
been
hastily
thrown
off
long
before
and
smoothing
back
her
hair
and
taking
the
fair
little
face
in
her
hands
she
looked
at
it
and
pressed
it
to
her
own
as
indeed
something
most
dearly
prized
and
valued
then
saying
i
must
lie
down
come
in
here
love
she
led
her
into
the
next
room
locked
the
door
made
ellen
stretch
herself
on
the
bed
and
placing
herself
beside
her
drew
her
close
to
her
bosom
again
murmuring
my
own
child
my
precious
child
my
ellen
my
own
darling
why
did
you
stay
away
so
long
from
me
tell
me
it
was
necessary
to
tell
and
this
could
not
be
done
without
revealing
miss
fortune
disgraceful
conduct
ellen
was
sorry
for
that
she
knew
her
mother
american
match
had
been
unpopular
with
her
friends
and
now
what
notions
this
must
give
them
of
one
at
least
of
the
near
connections
to
whom
it
had
introduced
her
she
winced
under
what
might
be
her
grandmother
thoughts
lindsay
heard
her
in
absolute
silence
and
made
no
comment
and
at
the
end
again
kissed
her
lips
and
cheeks
and
embracing
her
ellen
as
a
recovered
treasure
that
would
not
be
parted
with
she
was
not
satisfied
till
she
had
drawn
ellen
head
fairly
to
rest
on
her
breast
and
then
her
caressing
hand
often
touched
her
cheek
or
smoothed
back
her
hair
softly
now
and
then
asking
slight
questions
about
her
voyage
and
journey
till
exhausted
from
excitement
more
than
fatigue
ellen
fell
asleep
her
grandmother
was
beside
her
when
she
awoke
and
busied
herself
with
evident
delight
in
helping
her
to
get
off
her
travelling
clothes
and
put
on
others
and
then
she
took
her
downstairs
and
presented
her
to
her
aunt
lady
keith
had
not
been
at
home
nor
in
scotland
at
the
time
the
letters
passed
between
montgomery
and
her
mother
and
the
result
of
that
correspondence
respecting
ellen
had
been
known
to
no
one
except
lindsay
and
her
son
they
had
long
given
her
up
the
rather
as
they
had
seen
in
the
papers
the
name
of
captain
montgomery
among
those
lost
in
the
lady
keith
therefore
had
no
suspicion
who
ellen
might
be
she
received
her
affectionately
but
ellen
did
not
get
rid
of
her
first
impression
her
uncle
she
did
not
see
until
late
in
the
day
when
he
came
home
the
evening
was
extremely
fair
and
having
obtained
permission
ellen
wandered
out
into
the
shrubbery
glad
to
be
alone
and
glad
for
a
moment
to
exchange
new
faces
for
old
the
flowers
were
old
friends
to
her
and
never
had
looked
more
friendly
than
then
new
and
old
both
were
there
ellen
went
on
softly
from
to
soothed
and
rested
stopping
here
to
smell
one
or
there
to
gaze
at
some
old
favourite
or
new
beauty
thinking
curious
thoughts
of
the
past
and
the
future
and
through
it
all
taking
a
quiet
lesson
from
the
flowers
when
a
servant
came
after
her
with
a
request
from
lindsay
that
she
would
return
to
the
house
ellen
hurried
in
she
guessed
for
what
and
was
sure
as
soon
as
she
opened
the
door
and
saw
the
figure
of
a
gentleman
sitting
before
lindsay
ellen
remembered
well
she
was
sent
to
her
uncle
as
well
as
her
grandmother
and
she
came
forward
with
a
beating
heart
to
lindsay
outstretched
hand
which
presented
her
to
this
other
ruler
of
her
destiny
he
was
very
different
from
lady
keith
her
anxious
glance
saw
that
at
once
more
like
his
mother
a
man
not
far
from
fifty
years
old
and
stately
like
her
ellen
was
not
left
long
in
suspense
his
look
instantly
softened
as
his
mother
had
done
he
drew
her
to
his
arms
with
great
affection
and
evidently
with
very
great
pleasure
then
held
her
off
for
a
moment
while
he
looked
at
her
changing
colour
and
downcast
eye
and
folded
her
close
in
his
arms
again
from
which
he
seemed
hardly
willing
to
let
her
go
whispering
as
he
kissed
her
you
are
my
own
child
now
you
are
my
little
daughter
do
you
know
that
ellen
i
am
your
father
henceforth
you
belong
to
me
entirely
and
i
belong
to
you
my
own
little
daughter
i
wonder
how
many
times
one
may
be
adopted
thought
ellen
that
evening
but
to
be
sure
my
father
and
my
mother
have
quite
given
me
up
here
that
makes
a
difference
they
had
a
right
to
give
me
away
if
they
pleased
i
suppose
i
do
belong
to
my
uncle
and
grandmother
in
good
earnest
and
i
can
not
help
myself
well
but
humphreys
seems
a
great
deal
more
like
my
father
than
my
uncle
lindsay
i
can
not
help
that
but
how
they
would
be
vexed
if
they
knew
it
that
was
profoundly
true
ellen
was
in
a
few
days
the
dear
pet
and
darling
of
the
whole
household
without
exception
and
almost
without
limit
at
first
for
a
day
or
two
there
was
a
little
lurking
doubt
a
little
anxiety
a
constant
watch
on
the
part
of
all
her
friends
whether
they
were
not
going
to
find
something
in
their
newly
acquired
treasure
to
disappoint
them
whether
it
could
be
that
there
was
nothing
behind
to
belie
the
first
promise
less
keen
observers
however
could
not
have
failed
to
see
very
soon
that
there
was
no
to
be
looked
for
ellen
was
just
what
she
seemed
without
the
shadow
of
a
cloak
in
anything
doubts
vanished
and
ellen
had
not
been
three
days
in
the
house
when
she
was
taken
home
to
two
hearts
at
least
in
unbounded
love
and
tenderness
when
lindsay
was
present
he
was
not
satisfied
without
having
ellen
in
his
arms
or
close
beside
him
and
if
not
there
she
was
at
the
side
of
her
grandmother
there
was
nothing
however
in
the
character
of
this
fondness
great
as
it
was
that
would
have
inclined
any
child
to
presume
upon
it
ellen
was
least
of
all
likely
to
try
but
if
her
will
by
any
chance
had
run
counter
to
theirs
she
would
have
found
it
impossible
to
maintain
her
ground
she
understood
this
from
the
first
with
her
grandmother
and
in
one
or
two
trifles
since
had
been
more
and
more
confirmed
in
the
feeling
that
they
would
do
with
her
and
make
of
her
precisely
what
they
pleased
without
the
smallest
regard
to
her
fancy
if
it
jumped
with
theirs
very
well
if
not
it
must
yield
in
one
matter
ellen
had
been
roused
to
plead
very
hard
and
even
with
tears
to
have
her
wish
which
she
verily
thought
she
ought
to
have
had
lindsay
smiled
and
kissed
her
and
went
on
with
the
utmost
coolness
in
what
she
was
doing
which
she
carried
through
without
in
the
least
regarding
ellen
distress
or
showing
the
slightest
discomposure
and
the
same
thing
was
repeated
every
day
till
ellen
got
used
to
it
her
uncle
she
had
never
seen
tried
but
she
knew
it
would
be
the
same
with
him
when
lindsay
clasped
her
to
his
bosom
ellen
felt
it
was
as
his
eye
always
seemed
to
repeat
little
daughter
and
in
his
own
manner
love
was
mingled
with
as
much
authority
perhaps
ellen
did
not
like
them
much
the
worse
for
this
as
she
had
no
sort
of
disposition
to
displease
them
in
anything
but
it
gave
rise
to
sundry
thoughts
however
which
she
kept
to
herself
thoughts
that
went
both
to
the
future
and
the
past
lady
keith
it
may
be
had
less
to
give
than
her
mother
and
brother
but
pride
took
up
the
matter
instead
and
according
to
her
measure
ellen
held
with
her
the
same
place
she
held
with
and
lindsay
being
the
great
delight
and
darling
of
all
three
and
with
all
three
seemingly
the
great
object
in
life
a
few
days
after
her
arrival
a
week
or
more
she
underwent
one
evening
a
kind
of
catechising
from
her
aunt
as
to
her
former
manner
of
life
where
she
had
been
and
with
whom
since
her
mother
left
her
what
she
had
been
doing
whether
she
had
been
to
school
and
how
her
time
was
spent
at
home
no
comments
whatever
were
made
on
her
answers
but
a
something
in
her
aunt
face
and
manner
induced
ellen
to
make
her
replies
as
brief
and
to
give
her
as
little
information
in
them
as
she
could
she
did
not
feel
inclined
to
enlarge
upon
anything
or
to
go
at
all
further
than
the
questions
obliged
her
and
lady
keith
ended
without
having
more
than
a
very
general
notion
of
ellen
way
of
life
for
three
or
four
years
past
this
conversation
was
repeated
to
her
grandmother
and
uncle
to
think
said
the
latter
the
next
morning
at
breakfast
to
think
that
the
backwoods
of
america
should
have
turned
us
out
such
a
little
specimen
of
of
what
uncle
said
ellen
laughing
ah
i
shall
not
tell
you
that
said
he
but
it
is
extraordinary
said
lady
keith
how
after
living
among
a
parcel
of
and
thicker
tongued
yankees
she
could
come
out
and
speak
pure
english
in
a
clear
voice
it
is
an
enigma
to
me
take
care
catherine
said
lindsay
laughing
you
are
touching
ellen
nationality
look
here
said
he
drawing
his
fingers
down
her
cheek
she
must
learn
to
have
no
nationality
but
yours
said
lady
keith
somewhat
shortly
ellen
lips
were
open
but
she
spoke
not
it
is
well
you
have
come
out
from
the
americans
you
see
ellen
pursued
lindsay
your
aunt
does
not
like
them
but
why
sir
why
said
he
gravely
do
you
know
that
they
are
a
parcel
of
rebels
who
have
broken
loose
from
all
loyalty
and
fealty
that
no
good
briton
has
any
business
to
like
you
are
not
in
earnest
uncle
are
i
see
said
he
looking
amused
are
you
one
of
those
who
make
a
saint
of
george
washington
no
said
ellen
i
think
he
was
a
great
deal
better
than
some
saints
but
i
do
think
the
americans
were
rebels
you
are
a
little
rebel
yourself
do
you
mean
to
say
you
think
the
americans
were
right
do
you
mean
to
say
you
think
they
were
wrong
uncle
i
assure
you
said
he
if
i
had
been
in
the
english
army
i
would
have
fought
them
with
all
my
heart
and
if
i
had
been
in
the
american
army
i
would
have
fought
with
all
my
heart
uncle
lindsay
come
come
said
he
laughing
fight
you
do
look
as
if
you
would
do
battle
with
a
mosquito
ah
but
i
mean
if
i
had
been
a
man
said
ellen
you
had
better
put
in
that
qualification
after
all
i
am
inclined
to
think
it
may
be
as
well
for
you
on
the
whole
that
we
did
not
meet
i
do
know
but
we
might
have
had
a
pretty
stiff
encounter
though
a
good
cause
is
stronger
than
a
bad
one
uncle
but
ellen
these
americans
forfeited
entirely
the
character
of
good
friends
to
england
and
good
subjects
to
king
george
yes
but
it
was
king
george
fault
uncle
he
and
the
english
forfeited
their
characters
first
i
declare
said
lindsay
laughing
if
your
sword
had
been
as
stout
as
your
tongue
i
do
know
how
i
might
have
come
off
in
that
same
encounter
i
hope
ellen
will
get
rid
of
these
strange
notions
about
the
americans
said
lady
keith
discontentedly
i
hope
not
aunt
keith
said
ellen
where
did
you
get
them

lindsay

sir
these
notions
in
reading
sir
reading
different
books
and
talking
reading
so
you

read
in
the
backwoods
sir
said
ellen
with
a
look
of
surprise
what
have
you
read
on
this
subject
two
lives
of
washington
and
some
in
the
annual
register
and
part
of
graham
united
states
and
one
or
two
other
little
things
but
those
gave
you
only
one
side
ellen
you
should
read
the
english
account
of
the
matter
so
i
did
sir
the
annual
register
gave
me
both
sides
the
bills
and
messages

enough
what
annual
register

do
know

it
is
english
written
by
burke
i
believe
upon
my
word
and
what
else

things

ellen
smiling

good
deal

so
much
before

could
sir
i
had
a
great
many
other
things
to
do
what

ellen
hesitating
from
the
remembrance
of
her
aunt
manner
the
night
before

me
i
had
to
sweep
and
dust
said
ellen

and

tables
and
wash
and
wipe
dishes
and
churn
and
spin
and
ellen
lady
keith
look
in
her
could
you
have
conceived
it
what
shall
we
do
with
her

lindsay
send
her
to
school
or
keep
her
at
home
have
you
never
been
to
school
ellen
no
sir
except
for
a
very
little
while
more
than
three
years
ago
would
you
like
it
i
would
a
deal
rather
study
at
home
sir
if
you
will
let
me
what
do
you
know
now
oh
i
ca
tell
sir
said
ellen
i
do
know
anything
very
well
unless
unless
what
said
her
uncle
laughing
come
now
for
your
accomplishments
i
had
rather
not
say
what
i
was
going
to
uncle
please
do
ask
me
yes
yes
said
he
i
sha
let
you
off
unless
what
i
was
going
to
say
unless
riding
said
ellen
colouring
riding
and
pray
how
did
you
learn
to
ride
catch
a
horse
by
the
mane
and
mount
him
by
the
fence
and
canter
off
was
that
it
eh
not
exactly
sir
said
ellen
laughing
well
but
about
your
other
accomplishments
you
do
not
know
anything
of
french
i
suppose
yes
i
do
sir
where
did
you
get
that
an
old
swiss
lady
in
the
mountains
taught
me
country
riding
and
swiss
french
muttered
her
uncle
did
she
teach
you
to
speak
it
yes
sir
lindsay
and
his
mother
exchanged
glances
which
ellen
interpreted
worse
and
worse
one
thing
at
least
can
be
mended
observed
lindsay
she
shall
go
to
de
courcey
as
soon
as
we
get
to
edinburgh
indeed
uncle
i
do
think
that
will
be
necessary
who
taught
you
to
ride
ellen
asked
lady
keith
my
brother
humph
i
fancy
a
few
lessons
will
do
you
no
harm
she
remarked
ellen
coloured
and
was
silent
you
know
nothing
of
music
of
course
i
can
not
play
uncle
can
you
sing
i
can
sing
hymns
sing
hymns
that
the
only
fault
i
find
with
you
ellen
you
are
too
sober
i
should
like
to
see
you
a
little
more
gay
like
other
children
but
uncle
i
am
not
unhappy
because
i
am
sober
but
i
am
said
he
i
do
not
know
precisely
what
i
shall
do
with
you
i
must
do
something
can
you
sing
nothing
but
hymns
said
lady
keith
yes
said
ellen
with
some
humour
twinkling
about
her
eyes
and
mouth
i
can
sing
columbia
absurd
said
lady
keith
why
ellen
said
her
uncle
laughing
i
did
not
know
you
could
be
so
stubborn
i
thought
you
were
made
up
of
gentleness
and
mildness
let
me
have
a
good
look
at
you
there
not
much
stubbornness
in
those
eyes
he
said
fondly
i
hope
you
will
never
salute
ears
with
your
american
ditty
said
lady
keith
tut
tut
said
lindsay
she
shall
sing
what
she
pleases
and
the
more
the
better
she
has
a
very
sweet
voice
said
her
grandmother
yes
in
speaking
i
know
i
have
not
heard
it
tried
otherwise
and
very
nice
english
it
turns
out
where
did
you
get
your
english
ellen
from
my
brother
said
ellen
with
a
smile
of
pleasure
lindsay
brow
rather
clouded
whom
do
you
mean
by
that
the
brother
of
the
lady
who
was
so
kind
to
me
ellen
disliked
to
speak
the
loved
names
in
the
hearing
of
ears
to
which
she
knew
they
would
be
unlovely
how
was
she
so
kind
to
you
oh
sir
in
everything
i
can
not
tell
you
she
was
my
friend
when
i
had
only
one
beside
she
did
everything
for
me
and
who
was
the
other
friend
your
aunt
no
sir
this
brother
no
sir
that
was
before
i
knew
him
who
then
his
name
was
van
brunt
van
brunt
humph
and
what
was
he
he
was
a
farmer
sir
a
dutch
farmer
eh
how
came
you
to
have
anything
to
do
with
he
managed
my
aunt
farm
and
was
a
great
deal
in
the
house
he
was
and
what
makes
you
call
this
other
his
sister
called
me
her
sister
and
that
makes
me
his
it
is
very
absurd
said
lady
keith
when
they
are
nothing
at
all
to
her
and
ought
not
to
be
it
seems
then
you
did
not
find
a
friend
in
your
aunt
ellen
eh
i
do
think
she
loved
me
much
said
ellen
in
a
low
voice
i
am
very
glad
we
are
clear
of
obligation
on
score
said
lindsay
obligation
and
so
you
had
nothing
else
to
depend
on
ellen
but
this
man
this
van
something
this
dutchman
what
did
he
do
for
you
a
great
deal
sir
ellen
would
have
said
more
but
a
feeling
in
her
throat
stopped
her
now
just
hear
that
will
you
said
lady
keith
just
think
of
her
in
that
with
that
sweeping
and
dusting
woman
and
a
dutch
farmer
for
these
three
years
no
said
ellen
not
all
the
time
this
last
year
i
have
been
where
ellen
at
the
other
house
sir
what
house
is
that
where
that
lady
and
gentleman
lived
that
were
my
best
friends
well
it
all
very
well
said
lady
keith
but
it
is
past
now
it
is
all
over
you
need
not
think
of
them
any
more
we
will
find
you
better
friends
than
any
of
these
dutch
brunters
or
grunters
oh
aunt
keith
said
ellen
if
you
knew
but
she
burst
into
tears
come
come
said
lindsay
taking
her
into
his
arms
i
will
not
have
that
hush
my
daughter
what
is
the
matter
ellen
but
ellen
had
with
some
difficulty
contained
herself
two
or
three
times
before
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
and
she
wept
now
rather
violently
what
is
the
matter
ellen
because
said
ellen
thoroughly
roused
i
love
them
dearly
and
i
ought
to
love
them
with
all
my
heart
i
can
not
forget
them
and
never
shall
and
i
can
never
have
better
friends
never
it
impossible
oh
it
impossible
lindsay
said
nothing
at
first
except
to
soothe
her
but
when
she
had
wept
herself
into
quietness
upon
his
breast
he
whispered
it
is
right
to
love
these
people
if
they
were
kind
to
you
but
as
your
aunt
says
that
is
past
it
is
not
necessary
to
go
back
to
it
forget
that
you
were
american
ellen
you
belong
to
me
your
name
is
not
montgomery
any
more
it
is
lindsay
and
i
will
not
have
you
call
me
i
am
your
father
you
are
my
own
little
daughter
and
must
do
precisely
what
i
tell
you
do
you
understand
me
he
would
have
a
yes
from
her
and
then
added
go
and
get
yourself
ready
and
i
will
take
you
with
me
to
edinburgh
ellen
tears
had
been
like
to
burst
forth
again
at
his
words
with
great
effort
she
controlled
herself
and
obeyed
him
i
shall
do
precisely
what
he
tells
me
of
course
she
said
to
herself
as
she
went
to
get
ready
but
there
are
some
things
he
can
not
command
nor
i
neither
i
am
glad
of
that
forget
indeed
she
could
not
help
loving
her
uncle
for
the
lips
that
kissed
her
were
very
kind
as
well
as
very
peremptory
and
if
the
hand
that
pressed
her
cheek
was
as
she
felt
it
was
the
hand
of
power
its
touch
was
also
exceeding
fond
and
as
she
was
no
more
inclined
to
dispute
his
will
than
he
to
permit
it
the
harmony
between
them
was
perfect
and
unbroken

touch
of
that
magic
wand
longfellow
lindsay
had
some
reason
that
morning
to
wish
that
ellen
would
look
merrier
it
was
a
very
sober
little
face
he
saw
by
his
side
as
the
carriage
rolled
smoothly
on
with
them
towards
edinburgh
almost
pale
in
its
sadness
he
lavished
the
tenderest
kindness
upon
her
and
without
going
back
by
so
much
as
a
hint
to
the
subjects
of
the
morning
he
exerted
himself
to
direct
her
attention
to
the
various
objects
of
note
and
interest
they
were
passing
the
day
was
fine
and
the
country
also
the
carriage
and
the
horses
ellen
was
dearly
fond
of
driving
and
long
before
they
reached
the
city
lindsay
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
her
smile
break
again
her
eye
brighten
and
her
happy
attention
fixing
on
the
things
he
pointed
out
to
her
and
many
others
that
she
found
for
herself
on
the
way
his
horses
first
of
all
lindsay
might
relax
his
efforts
and
look
on
with
secret
triumph
ellen
was
in
the
full
train
of
delighted
observation
you
are
easily
pleased
ellen
he
said
in
answer
to
one
of
her
simple
remarks
of
admiration
i
have
a
great
deal
to
please
me
said
ellen
what
would
you
like
to
see
in
edinburgh
i
do
know
sir
anything
you
please
then
i
will
show
you
a
little
of
the
city
in
the
first
place
they
drove
through
the
streets
of
edinburgh
both
the
old
and
the
new
town
in
various
directions
lindsay
extremely
pleased
to
see
that
ellen
was
so
and
much
amused
at
the
curiosity
shown
in
her
questions
which
however
were
by
no
means
as
free
and
frequent
as
they
might
have
been
had
john
humphreys
filled
her
uncle
place
what
large
building
is
that
over
there
said
ellen
that
that
is
holyrood
house
holyrood
i
have
heard
of
that
before
is
that
where
queen
rooms
are
where
rizzio
was
killed
yes
would
you
like
to
see
them
oh
much
drive
to
the
abbey
so
you
have
read
scottish
history
as
well
as
american
ellen
not
very
much
sir
only
the
of
a
grandfather
yet
but
what
made
me
say
that
i
have
read
an
account
of
holyrood
house
somewhere
uncle
ellen
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
i
forgot
it
seems
strange
to
me
said
ellen
looking
distressed
it
must
not
seem
strange
to
you
my
daughter
what
were
you
going
to
say
i
do
know
sir
oh
i
was
going
to
ask
if
the
silver
cross
is
here
now
to
be
seen
what
silver
cross
that
one
from
which
the
abbey
was
named
the
silver
rood
that
was
given
they
pretended
to
i
forget
now
what
king
david
first
the
founder
of
the
abbey
no
it
is
not
here
ellen
david
the
second
lost
it
to
the
english
but
why
do
you
say
ellen
it
was
a
very
real
affair
kept
in
england
for
a
long
time
with
great
veneration
oh
yes
sir
i
know
the
was
real
i
mean
it
was
pretended
that
an
angel
gave
it
to
king
david
when
he
was
hunting
here
well
how
can
you
tell
but
that
was
so
king
david
was
made
a
saint
you
know
oh
sir
said
ellen
laughing
i
know
better
than
that
i
know
it
was
only
a
monkish
trick
monkish
trick
which
do
you
mean
the
giving
of
the
cross
or
making
the
king
a
saint
both
sir
said
ellen
still
smiling
at
that
rate
said
lindsay
much
amused
if
you
are
such
a
sceptic
you
will
take
no
comfort
in
anything
at
the
abbey
you
will
not
believe
anything
is
genuine
i
will
believe
what
you
tell
me
sir
will
you
i
must
be
careful
what
i
say
to
you
then
or
i
may
run
the
risk
of
losing
my
own
credit
lindsay
spoke
this
half
jestingly
half
in
earnest
they
went
over
the
palace
is
this
very
old
sir
asked
ellen
not
very
it
has
been
burnt
and
demolished
and
rebuilt
till
nothing
is
left
of
the
old
abbey
of
king
david
but
the
ruins
of
the
chapel
which
you
shall
see
presently
the
oldest
part
of
the
house
is
that
we
are
going
to
see
now
built
by
james
fifth
mary
father
where
her
rooms
are
at
these
rooms
ellen
looked
with
intense
interest
she
pored
over
the
old
furniture
the
needlework
of
which
she
was
told
was
at
least
in
part
the
work
of
the
beautiful
queen
own
fingers
gazed
at
the
stains
in
the
floor
of
the
said
to
be
those
of
rizzio
blood
meditated
over
the
in
the
passage
by
which
the
conspirators
had
come
up
and
finally
sat
down
in
the
room
and
tried
to
realise
the
scene
which
had
once
been
acted
there
she
tried
to
imagine
the
poor
queen
and
her
attendant
and
her
favourite
rizzio
sitting
there
at
supper
and
how
that
door
that
very
door
had
opened
and
ghastly
figure
pale
and
weak
from
illness
presented
itself
and
then
others
the
alarm
of
the
moment
how
rizzio
knew
they
were
come
for
him
and
fled
to
the
queen
for
protection
how
she
was
withheld
from
giving
it
and
the
unhappy
man
pulled
away
from
her
and
stabbed
with
a
great
many
wounds
before
her
face
and
there
there
no
doubt
his
blood
fell
you
are
tired
this
does
please
you
much
said
lindsay
noticing
her
grave
look
oh
it
pleases
me
much
said
ellen
starting
up
i
do
not
wonder
she
swore
vengeance
who
said
lindsay
queen
mary
sir
were
you
thinking
of
her
all
this
while
i
am
glad
of
it
i
spoke
to
you
once
without
getting
a
word
i
was
afraid
this
was
not
amusing
enough
to
detain
your
thoughts
oh
yes
it
was
said
ellen
i
have
been
trying
to
think
all
about
that
i
like
to
look
at
old
things
very
much
perhaps
you
would
like
to
see
the
regalia
the
what
sir
the
royal
things
the
old
diadem
and
sceptre
of
the
scottish
kings
well
come
said
he
as
he
read
the
answer
in
ellen
face
we
will
go
but
first
let
us
see
the
old
chapel
with
this
ellen
was
wonderfully
pleased
this
was
much
older
still
than
queen
mary
rooms
ellen
admired
the
wild
melancholy
look
of
the
gothic
pillars
and
arches
springing
from
the
green
turf
the
large
carved
window
empty
of
glass
the
broken
walls
and
looking
up
to
the
blue
sky
she
tried
to
imagine
the
time
when
the
gothic
roof
closed
overhead
and
music
sounded
through
the
arches
and
trains
of
stoled
monks
paced
through
them
where
now
the
very
pavement
was
not
strange
it
seemed
and
hard
to
go
back
and
realise
it
but
in
the
midst
of
this
the
familiar
face
of
the
sky
set
ellen
thoughts
off
upon
a
new
track
and
suddenly
they
were
on
the
lawn
before
the
parsonage
the
monks
and
the
abbey
were
forgotten
she
silently
gave
her
hand
to
her
uncle
and
walked
with
him
to
the
carriage
arrived
at
the
crown
room
ellen
fell
into
another
fit
of
grave
attention
but
lindsay
taught
better
did
not
this
time
mistake
rapt
interest
for
absence
of
mind
he
answered
questions
and
gave
her
several
pieces
of
information
and
let
her
take
her
own
time
to
gaze
and
meditate
this
beautiful
sword
said
he
was
a
present
from
pope
julius
second
to
james
fourth
i
do
know
anything
about
the
popes
said
ellen
james
fourth
i
forget
what
kind
of
a
king
he
was
he
was
a
very
good
king
he
was
the
one
that
died
at
flodden
oh
and
wore
an
iron
girdle
because
he
had
fought
against
his
father
poor
man
why
man
ellen
he
was
a
very
royal
prince
why
do
you
say
man
because
he
did
know
any
better
sir
did
know
any
better
than
what
than
to
think
an
iron
girdle
would
do
him
any
good
but
why
would
it
do
him
any
good
because
you
know
sir
that
is
not
the
way
we
can
have
our
sins
forgiven
what
the
way
ellen
looked
at
him
to
see
if
he
was
in
jest
or
earnest
her
look
staggered
him
a
little
but
he
repeated
his
question
she
cast
her
eyes
down
and
answered
jesus
christ
said
am
the
way
the
truth
and
the
life
no
man
cometh
unto
the
father
but
by
me
lindsay
said
no
more
i
wish
that
was
the
bruce
crown
said
ellen
after
a
while
i
should
like
to
see
anything
that
belonged
to
him
i
take
you
to
the
field
of
bannockburn
some
day
that
belonged
to
him
with
a
vengeance
it
lies
over
yonder
bannockburn
will
you
and
stirling
castle
oh
how
i
should
like
that
stirling
castle
said
lindsay
smiling
at
ellen
clasped
hands
of
delight
what
do
you
know
of
stirling
castle
from
the
history
you
know
sir
and
the
lord
of
the
isles
stirling
towers
arose
in
light
go
on
said
lindsay
twined
in
links
of
silver
bright
her
winding
river
lay
that
this
same
river
forth
ellen
do
you
know
any
more
oh
yes
sir
go
on
and
tell
me
all
you
can
remember
that
would
be
a
great
deal
sir
go
on
till
i
tell
you
to
stop
ellen
gave
him
a
good
part
of
the
battle
with
introduction
to
it
you
have
a
good
memory
ellen
he
said
looking
pleased
because
i
like
it
sir
that
makes
it
easy
to
remember
i
like
the
scots
people
do
you
said
lindsay
much
gratified
i
did
not
know
you
liked
anything
on
this
side
of
the
water
why
do
you
like
them
because
they
never
would
be
conquered
by
the
english
so
said
lindsay
half
amused
and
half
disappointed
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
is
you
like
them
because
they
fought
the
enemies
you
were
so
eager
to
have
a
blow
at
oh
no
sir
said
ellen
laughing
i
do
not
mean
that
at
all
the
french
were
england
enemies
too
and
helped
us
besides
but
i
like
the
scots
a
great
deal
better
than
the
french
i
like
them
because
they
would
be
free
you
have
an
extraordinary
taste
for
freedom
and
pray
are
all
the
american
children
as
strong
republicans
as
yourself
i
do
know
sir
i
hope
so
pretty
well
upon
my
word
then
i
suppose
even
the
bruce
can
not
rival
your
favourite
washington
in
your
esteem
ellen
smiled
eh
said
lindsay
i
like
washington
better
sir
of
course
but
i
like
bruce
very
much
why
do
you
prefer
washington
i
should
have
to
think
to
tell
you
that
sir
very
well
think
and
answer
me
one
reason
i
suppose
is
because
he
was
an
american
said
ellen
that
is
not
reason
enough
for
so
reasonable
a
person
as
you
are
ellen
you
must
try
again
or
give
up
your
preference
i
like
bruce
very
much
indeed
said
ellen
musingly
but
he
did
what
he
did
for
washington
did
humph
i
am
not
quite
sure
as
to
either
of
your
positions
and
besides
said
ellen
bruce
did
one
or
two
wrong
things
washington
always
did
right
he
did
eh
what
do
you
think
of
the
murder
of
andre
i
think
it
was
right
said
ellen
firmly
your
reasons
my
little
reasoner
asked
lindsay
if
it
had
not
been
right
washington
would
not
have
done
it
ha
ha
so
at
that
rate
you
may
reconcile
yourself
to
anything
that
chances
to
be
done
by
a
favourite
no
sir
said
ellen
a
little
confused
but
standing
her
ground
but
when
a
person
does
right
if
he
happened
to
do
something
that
i
do
know
enough
to
understand
i
have
good
reason
to
think
it
is
right
even
though
i
can
not
understand
it
very
well
but
apply
the
same
rule
of
judgment
to
the
bruce
you
nothing
could
make
me
think
the
murder
of
the
red
comyn
right
sir
bruce
did
think
so
himself
but
remember
there
is
a
great
difference
in
the
times
those
were
rude
and
uncivilised
compared
to
these
you
must
make
allowance
for
that
yes
sir
i
do
but
i
like
the
civilised
times
best
what
do
you
think
of
this
fellow
over
here
what
his
name
whose
monument
i
was
showing
you
nelson
i
used
to
like
him
very
much
sir
and
you
do
not
now
yes
sir
i
do
i
can
not
help
liking
him
that
is
to
say
you
would
if
you
could
i
do
think
sir
i
ought
to
like
a
man
merely
for
being
great
unless
he
was
good
washington
was
great
and
good
both
well
what
is
the
matter
with
nelson
said
lindsay
with
an
expression
of
intense
amusement
i
to
think
as
you
say
that
he
was
a
very
noble
fellow
so
he
was
sir
but
he
was
a
good
man
why
not
why
you
know
sir
he
left
his
wife
and
lady
hamilton
persuaded
him
to
do
one
or
two
other
very
dishonourable
things
it
was
a
great
pity
so
you
will
not
like
any
great
man
that
is
not
good
as
well
what
is
your
definition
of
a
good
man
ellen
one
who
always
does
right
because
it
is
right
no
matter
whether
it
is
convenient
or
not
said
ellen
after
a
little
hesitation
upon
my
word
you
draw
the
line
close
but
opinions
differ
as
to
what
is
right
how
shall
we
know
from
the
bible
sir
said
ellen
quickly
with
a
look
that
half
amused
and
half
abashed
him
and
you
ellen
are
you
yourself
after
this
nice
fashion
no
sir
but
i
wish
to
be
i
do
believe
that
but
after
all
ellen
you
might
like
nelson
those
were
only
the
spots
in
the
sun
yes
sir
but
can
a
man
be
a
truly
great
man
who
is
not
master
of
himself
that
is
an
excellent
remark
it
is
not
mine
sir
said
ellen
blushing
it
was
told
me
i
did
not
find
out
all
that
about
nelson
myself
i
did
not
see
it
all
the
first
time
i
read
his
life
i
thought
he
was
perfect
i
know
who
think
is
said
lindsay
kissing
her
they
drove
now
to
his
house
in
george
street
lindsay
had
some
business
to
attend
to
and
would
leave
her
there
for
an
hour
or
two
and
that
their
fast
might
not
be
too
long
unbroken
allen
the
housekeeper
was
directed
to
furnish
them
with
some
biscuits
in
the
library
whither
lindsay
led
ellen
she
liked
the
looks
of
it
very
much
plenty
of
books
comfortable
furniture
pleasant
light
all
manner
of
et
ceteras
around
which
rejoiced
ellen
heart
lindsay
noticed
her
pleased
glance
passing
from
one
thing
to
another
he
placed
her
in
a
deep
took
off
her
bonnet
and
threw
it
on
the
sofa
and
kissing
her
fondly
asked
her
if
she
felt
at
home
not
yet
ellen
said
but
her
look
said
it
would
not
take
long
to
make
her
do
so
she
sat
enjoying
her
rest
and
munching
her
biscuit
with
great
appetite
and
satisfaction
when
lindsay
poured
her
out
a
glass
of
sweet
wine
the
glass
of
wine
looked
to
ellen
like
an
enemy
marching
up
to
attack
her
because
alice
and
john
did
not
drink
it
she
had
always
at
first
without
other
reason
done
the
same
and
she
was
determined
not
to
forsake
their
example
now
she
took
no
notice
of
the
glass
of
wine
though
she
had
ceased
to
see
anything
else
in
the
room
and
went
on
seemingly
as
before
eating
her
biscuits
though
she
no
longer
knew
how
they
tasted
why
do
you
drink
your
wine
ellen
i
do
not
wish
any
sir
do
you
like
it
i
do
know
sir
i
have
never
drunk
any
no
taste
it
and
see
i
would
rather
not
sir
if
you
please
i
do
care
for
it
taste
it
ellen
this
command
was
not
to
be
disobeyed
the
blood
rushed
to
temples
as
she
just
touched
the
glass
to
her
lips
and
set
it
down
again
well
said
lindsay
what
sir
how
do
you
like
it
i
like
it
very
well
sir
but
i
would
rather
not
drink
it
why
ellen
coloured
again
at
this
exceedingly
difficult
question
and
answered
as
well
as
she
could
that
she
had
never
been
accustomed
to
it
and
would
rather
not
it
is
of
no
sort
of
consequence
what
you
have
been
accustomed
to
said
lindsay
you
are
to
drink
it
all
ellen
ellen
dared
not
disobey
when
biscuits
and
wine
were
disposed
of
lindsay
drew
her
close
to
his
side
and
encircling
her
fondly
with
his
arms
said
i
shall
leave
you
now
for
an
hour
or
two
and
you
must
amuse
yourself
as
you
can
the
are
open
perhaps
you
can
find
something
there
or
there
are
prints
in
those
portfolios
or
you
can
go
over
the
house
and
make
yourself
acquainted
with
your
new
home
if
you
want
anything
ask
allen
does
it
look
pleasant
to
you
very
ellen
said
you
are
at
home
here
daughter
go
where
you
will
and
do
what
you
will
i
shall
not
leave
you
long
but
before
i
go
ellen
let
me
hear
you
call
me
father
ellen
obeyed
trembling
for
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
was
to
set
her
hand
and
seal
to
the
deed
of
gift
her
father
and
mother
had
made
but
there
was
no
retreat
it
was
spoken
and
lindsay
folding
her
close
in
his
arms
kissed
her
again
and
again
never
let
me
hear
you
call
me
anything
else
ellen
you
are
mine
own
now
my
own
child
my
own
little
daughter
you
shall
do
just
what
pleases
me
in
everything
and
let
bygones
be
bygones
and
now
lie
down
there
and
rest
daughter
you
are
trembling
from
head
to
foot
rest
and
amuse
yourself
in
any
way
you
like
till
i
return
he
left
the
room
i
have
done
it
now
thought
ellen
as
she
sat
in
the
corner
of
the
sofa
where
lindsay
had
tenderly
placed
her
i
have
called
him
my
father
i
am
bound
to
obey
him
after
this
i
wonder
what
in
the
world
they
will
make
me
do
next
if
he
chooses
to
make
me
drink
wine
every
day
i
must
do
it
i
can
not
help
myself
that
is
only
a
little
matter
but
what
if
they
were
to
want
me
to
do
something
wrong
they
might
john
never
did
i
could
not
have
disobeyed
possibly
but
i
could
them
if
it
was
necessary
and
if
it
is
necessary
i
will
i
should
have
a
dreadful
time
i
wonder
if
i
could
go
through
with
it
oh
yes
i
could
if
it
was
right
and
besides
would
rather
bear
anything
in
the
world
from
them
than
have
john
displeased
with
me
a
great
deal
rather
but
perhaps
after
all
they
will
not
want
anything
wrong
of
me
i
wonder
if
this
is
really
to
be
my
home
always
and
if
i
shall
ever
get
home
again
john
will
not
leave
me
here
but
i
do
see
how
in
the
world
he
can
help
it
for
my
father
and
my
mother
and
i
myself
i
know
what
he
would
tell
me
if
he
was
here
and
i
try
to
do
it
god
will
take
care
of
me
if
i
follow
him
it
is
none
of
my
business
simply
and
heartily
commending
her
interests
to
his
keeping
ellen
tried
to
lay
aside
the
care
of
herself
she
went
on
musing
how
very
different
and
how
much
greater
her
enjoyment
would
have
been
that
day
if
john
had
been
with
her
lindsay
to
be
sure
had
answered
her
questions
with
abundant
kindness
and
sufficient
ability
but
his
answers
did
not
as
those
of
her
brother
often
did
skilfully
draw
her
on
from
one
thing
to
another
till
a
train
of
thought
was
opened
which
at
the
setting
out
she
never
dreamed
of
and
along
with
the
joy
of
acquiring
new
knowledge
she
had
the
pleasure
of
discovering
new
fields
of
it
to
be
explored
and
the
delight
of
the
felt
exercise
and
enlargement
of
her
own
powers
which
were
sure
to
be
actively
called
into
play
lindsay
told
her
what
she
asked
and
there
left
her
ellen
found
herself
growing
melancholy
over
the
comparison
she
was
drawing
and
wisely
went
to
the
to
divert
her
thoughts
finding
presently
a
history
of
scotland
she
took
it
down
resolving
to
refresh
her
memory
on
a
subject
which
had
gained
such
new
and
strange
interest
for
her
before
long
however
fatigue
and
the
wine
she
had
drunk
effectually
got
the
better
of
studious
thoughts
she
stretched
herself
on
the
sofa
and
fell
asleep
there
lindsay
found
her
a
couple
of
hours
afterwards
under
the
guard
of
the
housekeeper
i
cam
in
sir
she
said
whispering
it
mair
than
an
hour
back
and
she
been
sleeping
just
like
a
baby
ever
syne
she
hasna
stirred
a
finger
oh
lindsay
it
a
bonny
bairn
and
a
gude
what
a
blessing
to
the
house
you
about
right
there
i
believe
maggie
but
how
have
you
learned
it
so
fast
i
canna
be
george
i
ken
it
as
weel
as
if
we
had
had
a
year
auld
acquentance
i
ken
it
by
thae
sweet
mouth
and
een
and
by
the
look
she
gied
me
when
you
tauld
her
sir
i
had
been
in
the
house
near
as
long
yoursel
and
look
at
her
eenow
there
heaven
peace
within
i
assured
the
kiss
that
wakened
ellen
found
her
in
the
midst
of
a
dream
she
thought
that
john
was
a
king
of
scotland
and
standing
before
her
in
regal
attire
she
offered
him
she
thought
a
glass
of
wine
but
raising
the
sword
of
state
silver
scabbard
and
all
he
with
a
tremendous
swing
of
it
dashed
the
glass
out
of
her
hands
and
then
as
she
stood
abashed
he
went
forward
with
one
of
his
old
grave
kind
looks
to
kiss
her
as
the
kiss
touched
her
lips
ellen
opened
her
eyes
to
find
her
brother
transformed
into
lindsay
and
the
empty
glass
standing
safe
and
sound
upon
the
table
you
must
have
had
a
pleasant
nap
said
lindsay
you
wake
up
smiling
come
make
haste
i
have
left
a
friend
in
the
carriage
bring
your
book
along
if
you
want
it
the
presence
of
the
stranger
who
was
going
down
to
spend
a
day
or
two
at
the
braes
prevented
ellen
from
having
any
talking
to
do
comfortably
placed
in
the
corner
of
the
front
seat
of
the
barouche
leaning
on
the
elbow
of
the
carriage
she
was
left
to
her
own
musings
she
could
hardly
realise
the
change
in
her
circumstances
the
carriage
rolling
fast
and
smoothly
on
the
two
gentlemen
opposite
to
her
one
her
father
the
strange
varied
beautiful
scenes
they
were
flitting
by
the
long
shadows
made
by
the
descending
sun
the
cool
evening
air
ellen
leaning
back
in
the
wide
easy
seat
felt
as
if
she
were
in
a
dream
it
was
singularly
pleasant
she
could
not
help
but
enjoy
it
all
very
much
and
yet
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
she
were
caught
in
a
net
from
which
she
had
no
power
to
get
free
and
she
longed
to
clasp
that
hand
that
could
she
thought
draw
her
whence
and
whither
it
pleased
but
lindsay
opposite
i
have
called
him
my
father
i
have
given
myself
to
him
she
thought
but
i
gave
myself
to
somebody
else
first
i
ca
undo
that
and
i
never
will
again
she
tried
to
quiet
and
resign
the
care
of
herself
to
better
wisdom
and
greater
strength
than
her
own
this
may
all
be
arranged
easily
in
some
way
i
could
never
dream
of
she
said
to
herself
i
have
no
business
to
be
uneasy
two
months
ago
and
i
was
quietly
at
home
and
seemed
to
be
fixed
there
for
ever
and
now
without
anything
extraordinary
happening
here
i
am
just
as
fixed
yes
and
before
that
at
aunt
fortune
it
did
seem
possible
that
i
could
ever
get
away
from
being
her
child
and
yet
how
easily
all
that
was
managed
and
just
so
in
some
way
that
i
can
not
imagine
things
may
open
so
as
to
let
me
out
smoothly
from
this
she
resolved
to
be
patient
and
take
thankfully
what
she
at
present
had
to
enjoy
and
in
this
mood
of
mind
the
drive
home
was
beautiful
and
the
evening
was
happily
absorbed
in
the
history
of
scotland
it
was
a
grave
question
in
the
family
that
same
evening
whether
ellen
should
be
sent
to
school
lady
keith
was
decided
in
favour
of
it
her
mother
seemed
doubtful
lindsay
who
had
a
vision
of
the
little
figure
lying
asleep
on
his
library
sofa
thought
the
room
had
never
looked
so
cheerful
before
and
had
near
made
up
his
mind
that
she
should
be
its
constant
adornment
the
coming
winter
lady
keith
urged
the
school
plan
not
a
said
lindsay
i
will
not
hear
of
that
no
but
a
it
would
do
her
a
vast
deal
of
good
i
am
certain
her
notions
want
shaking
up
very
much
and
i
never
saw
a
child
of
her
age
so
much
a
child
i
assure
you
never
saw
one
so
much
a
woman
she
has
asked
me
i
suppose
said
he
smiling
a
hundred
questions
or
less
and
i
assure
you
there
was
not
one
foolish
or
vain
one
among
them
not
one
that
was
not
sensible
and
most
of
them
singularly
so
she
was
greatly
pleased
with
her
day
said
lindsay
i
never
saw
such
a
in
my
life
said
lady
keith
in
a
child
of
her
years
it
is
a
face
of
uncommon
intelligence
said
her
brother
it
is
both
said
lindsay
i
was
struck
with
it
the
other
day
said
lady
keith
the
day
she
slept
so
long
upon
the
sofa
upstairs
after
she
was
dressed
she
had
been
crying
about
something
and
her
eyelashes
were
wet
still
and
she
had
that
curious
grave
innocent
look
you
only
see
in
infants
you
might
have
thought
she
was
fourteen
months
instead
of
fourteen
years
old
fourteen
and
a
half
she
says
she
is
crying
said
lindsay
what
was
the
matter
nothing
said
lindsay
but
that
she
had
been
obliged
to
submit
to
me
in
something
that
did
not
please
her
did
she
give
you
any
cause
of
displeasure
no
though
i
can
see
she
has
strong
passions
but
she
is
the
first
child
i
ever
saw
that
i
think
i
could
not
get
angry
with
mother
heart
half
misgave
her
i
believe
said
lady
keith
laughing
she
sat
there
looking
at
her
for
an
hour
she
seems
to
be
perfectly
gentle
and
submissive
said
lindsay
yes
but
do
trust
too
much
to
appearances
said
his
sister
if
she
is
not
a
true
lindsay
after
all
i
am
mistaken
did
you
see
her
colour
once
or
twice
this
morning
when
something
was
said
that
did
not
please
her
you
can
judge
nothing
from
that
said
lindsay
she
colours
at
everything
you
should
have
seen
her
when
i
told
her
i
would
take
her
to
bannockburn
ah
she
has
got
the
right
side
of
you
you
will
be
able
to
discern
no
faults
in
her
presently
she
has
used
no
arts
for
it
sister
she
is
a
straightforward
little
hussy
and
that
is
one
thing
i
like
about
her
though
i
was
as
near
as
possible
being
provoked
with
her
once
or
twice
there
is
only
one
thing
i
wish
was
altered
she
has
her
head
filled
with
strange
notions
absurd
for
a
child
of
her
age
i
do
know
what
to
do
to
get
rid
of
them
after
some
more
conversation
it
was
decided
that
school
would
be
the
best
thing
for
this
end
and
half
decided
that
ellen
should
go
but
this
half
decision
lindsay
found
it
very
difficult
to
keep
to
and
circumstances
soon
destroyed
it
entirely
company
was
constantly
coming
and
going
at
the
braes
and
much
of
it
of
a
kind
that
ellen
exceedingly
liked
to
see
and
hear
intelligent
cultivated
people
whose
conversation
was
highly
agreeable
and
always
useful
to
her
ellen
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
talking
so
she
made
good
use
of
her
ears
one
evening
lindsay
a
villars
and
muller
a
swiss
gentleman
and
a
noted
man
of
science
very
much
at
home
in
lindsay
house
were
carrying
on
in
french
a
conversation
in
which
the
two
foreigners
took
part
against
their
host
villars
began
with
talking
about
lafayette
from
him
they
went
to
the
american
revolution
and
washington
from
them
to
other
patriots
and
other
republics
ancient
and
modern
mm
villars
and
muller
taking
the
side
of
freedom
and
pressing
lindsay
hard
with
argument
authority
example
and
historical
testimony
ellen
as
usual
was
fast
by
his
side
and
delighted
to
see
that
he
could
by
no
means
make
good
his
ground
the
ladies
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
would
several
times
have
drawn
her
away
but
happily
for
her
and
also
as
usual
lindsay
arm
was
around
her
shoulders
and
she
was
left
in
quiet
to
listen
the
conversation
was
very
lively
and
on
a
subject
very
interesting
to
her
for
america
had
been
always
a
darling
theme
scottish
struggles
for
freedom
were
fresh
in
her
mind
her
attention
had
long
ago
been
called
to
switzerland
and
its
history
by
alice
and
vawse
and
french
history
had
formed
a
good
part
of
her
last
winter
reading
she
listened
with
the
most
eager
delight
too
much
engrossed
to
notice
the
glances
that
were
every
now
and
then
given
her
by
one
of
the
speakers
not
lindsay
though
his
hand
was
upon
her
shoulder
or
playing
with
the
light
curls
that
fell
over
her
temples
did
not
see
that
her
face
was
flushed
with
interest
or
notice
the
quick
smile
and
sparkle
of
the
eye
that
followed
every
turn
in
the
conversation
that
favoured
her
wishes
or
foiled
his
it
was
muller
they
came
to
the
swiss
and
their
famous
struggle
for
freedom
against
austrian
oppression
muller
wished
to
speak
of
the
noted
battle
in
which
that
freedom
was
made
sure
but
for
the
moment
its
name
had
escaped
him
par
ma
foi
said
villars
il
entièrement
passé
lindsay
could
not
or
would
not
help
him
out
but
muller
suddenly
turned
to
ellen
in
whose
face
he
thought
he
saw
a
look
of
intelligence
and
begged
of
her
the
missing
name
morgarten
monsieur
said
ellen
blushing
morgarten
ça
said
he
with
a
polite
pleased
bow
of
thanks
lindsay
was
little
less
astonished
than
the
duke
of
argyle
when
his
gardener
claimed
to
be
the
owner
of
a
latin
work
on
mathematics
the
conversation
presently
took
a
new
turn
with
villars
and
muller
withdrawing
from
it
addressed
himself
to
ellen
he
was
a
elderly
gentleman
she
had
never
seen
him
before
that
evening
you
know
french
well
then
said
he
speaking
to
her
in
that
tongue
i
do
know
sir
said
ellen
modestly
and
you
have
heard
of
the
swiss
mountaineers
oh
yes
sir
a
great
deal
he
opened
his
watch
and
showed
her
in
the
back
of
it
an
exquisite
little
painting
asking
her
if
she
knew
what
it
was
it
is
an
alpine
châlet
is
it
not
sir
he
was
pleased
and
went
on
always
in
french
to
tell
ellen
that
switzerland
was
his
country
and
drawing
a
little
aside
from
the
other
talkers
he
entered
into
a
long
and
to
her
most
delightful
conversation
in
the
pleasantest
manner
he
gave
her
a
vast
deal
of
very
entertaining
detail
about
the
country
and
the
manners
and
the
habits
of
the
people
of
the
alps
especially
in
the
tyrol
where
he
had
often
travelled
it
would
have
been
hard
to
tell
whether
the
child
had
most
pleasure
in
receiving
or
the
man
of
deep
study
and
science
most
pleasure
in
giving
all
manner
of
information
he
saw
he
said
that
she
was
very
fond
of
the
heroes
of
freedom
and
asked
if
she
had
ever
heard
of
andrew
hofer
the
tyrolese
peasant
who
led
on
his
brethren
in
their
noble
endeavours
to
rid
themselves
of
french
and
bavarian
oppression
ellen
had
never
heard
of
him
you
know
william
tell
oh
yes
ellen
said
she
knew
him
and
bonaparte
yes
very
well
he
went
on
then
to
give
her
in
a
very
interesting
way
the
history
of
hofer
how
when
napoleon
made
over
his
country
to
the
rule
of
the
king
of
bavaria
who
oppressed
them
they
rose
in
mass
overcame
army
after
army
that
was
sent
against
them
in
their
mountain
fastnesses
and
freed
themselves
from
the
hated
bavarian
government
how
years
after
napoleon
was
at
last
too
strong
for
them
hofer
and
his
companions
defeated
hunted
like
wild
beasts
shot
down
like
them
how
hofer
was
at
last
betrayed
by
a
friend
taken
and
executed
being
only
seen
to
weep
at
parting
with
his
family
the
beautiful
story
was
well
told
and
the
speaker
was
animated
by
the
eager
deep
attention
and
sympathy
of
his
auditor
whose
changing
colour
smiles
and
even
tears
showed
how
well
she
entered
into
the
feelings
of
the
patriots
in
their
struggle
triumph
and
downfall
till
as
he
finished
she
was
left
full
of
pity
for
them
and
hatred
of
napoleon
they
talked
of
the
alps
again
muller
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
pulled
out
a
little
painting
in
mosaic
to
show
her
which
he
said
had
been
given
him
that
day
it
was
a
beautiful
piece
of
pietra
dura
work
mont
blanc
he
assured
her
the
mountain
often
looked
exactly
so
ellen
admired
it
very
much
it
was
meant
to
be
set
for
a
brooch
or
some
such
thing
he
said
and
he
asked
if
she
would
keep
it
and
sometimes
wear
it
to
remember
the
swiss
and
to
do
him
a
pleasure
moi
monsieur
said
ellen
colouring
high
with
surprise
and
pleasure
je
suis
bien
obligée
mais
monsieur
je
ne
saurais
vous
remercier
he
would
count
himself
well
paid
he
said
with
a
single
touch
of
her
lips
tenez
monsieur
said
ellen
blushing
but
smiling
and
tendering
back
the
mosaic
he
laughed
and
bowed
and
begged
her
pardon
and
said
she
must
keep
it
to
assure
him
she
had
forgiven
him
and
then
he
asked
by
what
name
he
might
remember
her
monsieur
je
ellen
m
she
stopped
short
in
utter
and
blank
uncertainty
what
to
call
herself
montgomery
she
dared
not
lindsay
stuck
in
her
throat
have
you
forgotten
it
said
muller
amused
at
her
look
or
is
it
a
secret
tell
muller
your
name
ellen
said
lindsay
turning
round
from
a
group
where
he
was
standing
at
a
little
distance
the
tone
was
stern
and
displeased
ellen
felt
it
keenly
and
with
difficulty
and
some
hesitation
still
murmured
ellen
lindsay
lindsay
are
you
the
daughter
of
my
friend
mr
lindsay
again
ellen
hesitated
in
great
doubt
how
to
answer
but
finally
not
without
starting
tears
said
oui
monsieur
your
memory
is
bad
said
lindsay
in
her
ear
you
had
better
go
where
you
can
refresh
it
ellen
took
this
as
a
hint
to
leave
the
room
which
she
did
immediately
not
a
little
hurt
at
the
displeasure
she
did
not
think
she
had
deserved
she
loved
lindsay
the
best
of
all
her
relations
and
really
loved
him
she
went
to
bed
and
to
sleep
again
that
night
with
wet
eyelashes
meanwhile
muller
was
gratifying
lindsay
in
a
high
degree
by
the
praises
he
bestowed
upon
his
daughter
her
intelligence
her
manners
her
modesty
and
her
he
asked
if
she
was
to
be
in
edinburgh
that
winter
and
whether
she
would
be
at
school
and
lindsay
declaring
himself
undecided
on
the
latter
point
muller
said
he
should
be
pleased
if
she
had
leisure
to
have
her
come
to
his
rooms
two
or
three
times
a
week
to
read
with
him
this
offer
from
a
person
of
muller
standing
and
studious
habits
lindsay
justly
took
as
both
a
great
compliment
and
a
great
promise
of
advantage
to
ellen
he
at
once
and
with
much
pleasure
accepted
it
so
the
question
of
school
was
settled
ellen
resolved
the
next
morning
to
lose
no
time
in
making
up
her
difference
with
lindsay
and
schooled
herself
to
use
a
form
of
words
that
she
thought
would
please
him
pride
said
indeed
do
no
such
thing
do
go
to
making
acknowledgments
when
you
have
not
been
in
the
wrong
you
are
not
bound
to
humble
yourself
before
unjust
displeasure
pride
pleaded
powerfully
but
neither
ellen
heart
nor
her
conscience
would
permit
her
to
take
this
advice
he
loves
me
very
much
she
thought
and
perhaps
he
did
not
understand
me
last
night
and
besides
i
owe
him
yes
i
do
a
child
obedience
now
i
ought
not
to
leave
him
displeased
with
me
a
moment
longer
than
i
can
help
and
besides
i
could
be
happy
so
god
gives
grace
to
the
humble
i
will
humble
myself
to
have
a
chance
for
executing
this
determination
she
went
downstairs
a
good
deal
earlier
than
usual
she
knew
lindsay
was
generally
there
before
the
rest
of
the
family
and
she
hoped
to
see
him
alone
it
was
too
soon
even
for
him
however
the
rooms
were
empty
so
ellen
took
her
book
from
the
table
and
being
perfectly
at
peace
with
herself
sat
down
in
the
window
and
was
presently
lost
in
the
interest
of
what
she
was
reading
she
did
not
know
of
lindsay
approach
till
a
little
imperative
tap
on
her
shoulder
startled
her
what
were
you
thinking
of
last
night
what
made
you
answer
muller
in
the
way
you
did
ellen
started
up
but
to
utter
her
prepared
speech
was
no
longer
possible
i
did
not
know
what
to
say
she
said
looking
down
what
do
you
mean
by
that
said
he
angrily
did
you
know
what
i
wished
you
to
say
yes
but
do
not
speak
to
me
in
that
way
exclaimed
ellen
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
pride
struggled
to
keep
back
the
tears
that
wanted
to
flow
i
shall
choose
my
own
method
of
speaking
why
did
you
not
say
what
you
knew
i
wished
you
to
say
i
was
afraid
i
did
know
but
he
would
think
what
was
true
that
is
precisely
what
i
wish
him
and
all
the
world
to
think
i
will
have
no
difference
made
ellen
either
by
them
or
you
now
lift
up
your
head
and
listen
to
me
said
he
taking
both
her
hands
i
lay
my
commands
upon
you
whenever
the
like
questions
may
be
asked
again
that
you
answer
simply
according
to
what
i
have
told
you
without
any
explanation
or
addition
it
is
true
and
if
people
draw
conclusions
that
are
not
true
it
is
what
i
wish
do
you
understand
me
ellen
bowed
will
you
obey
me
she
answered
again
in
the
same
mute
way
he
ceased
to
hold
her
at
arm
length
and
sitting
down
in
her
chair
drew
her
close
to
him
saying
more
kindly
you
must
not
displease
me
ellen
i
had
no
thought
of
displeasing
you
sir
said
ellen
bursting
into
tears
and
i
was
very
sorry
for
it
last
night
i
did
not
mean
to
disobey
you
i
only
hesitated
hesitate
no
more
my
commands
may
serve
to
remove
the
cause
of
it
you
are
my
daughter
ellen
and
i
am
your
father
poor
child
said
he
for
ellen
was
violently
agitated
i
do
believe
i
shall
have
much
difficulty
with
you
if
you
will
only
not
speak
and
look
at
me
so
said
ellen
it
makes
me
very
unhappy
hush
said
he
kissing
her
do
not
give
me
occasion
i
did
not
give
you
occasion
sir
why
ellen
said
lindsay
half
displeased
again
i
shall
begin
to
think
your
aunt
keith
is
right
that
you
are
a
true
lindsay
but
so
am
i
and
i
will
have
only
obedience
from
you
without
either
answering
or
argument
you
shall
murmured
ellen
but
do
not
be
displeased
with
me
father
ellen
had
schooled
herself
to
say
that
word
she
knew
it
would
greatly
please
him
and
she
was
not
mistaken
though
it
was
spoken
so
low
that
his
ears
could
but
just
catch
it
displeasure
was
entirely
overcome
he
pressed
her
to
his
heart
kissing
her
with
great
tenderness
and
would
not
let
her
go
from
his
arms
till
he
had
seen
her
smile
again
and
during
all
the
day
he
was
not
willing
to
have
her
out
of
his
sight
it
would
have
been
easy
that
morning
for
ellen
to
have
made
a
breach
between
them
that
would
not
readily
have
been
healed
one
word
of
humility
had
prevented
it
all
and
fastened
her
more
firmly
than
ever
in
lindsay
affection
she
met
with
nothing
from
him
but
tokens
of
great
and
tender
fondness
and
lady
keith
told
her
mother
apart
that
there
would
be
no
doing
anything
with
george
she
saw
he
was
getting
bewitched
with
that
child

scotch
song
in
a
few
weeks
they
moved
to
edinburgh
where
arrangements
were
speedily
made
for
giving
ellen
every
means
of
improvement
that
masters
and
mistresses
books
and
instruments
could
afford
the
house
in
george
street
was
large
and
pleasant
to
ellen
great
joy
a
pretty
little
room
opening
from
the
first
of
the
private
staircase
was
assigned
for
her
special
use
as
a
study
and
and
fitted
up
nicely
for
her
with
a
small
a
practising
piano
and
various
et
ceteras
here
her
beloved
desk
took
its
place
on
a
table
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
where
ellen
thought
she
would
make
many
a
new
drawing
when
she
was
by
herself
her
was
accommodated
with
a
smaller
stand
near
the
window
a
glass
door
at
one
end
of
the
room
opened
upon
a
small
iron
balcony
this
door
and
balcony
ellen
esteemed
a
very
particular
treasure
with
marvellous
satisfaction
she
arranged
and
arranged
her
little
sanctum
till
she
had
all
things
to
her
mind
and
it
only
wanted
she
thought
a
glass
of
flowers
i
will
have
that
too
some
of
these
days
she
said
to
herself
and
resolved
to
deserve
her
pretty
room
by
being
very
busy
there
it
was
hers
alone
open
indeed
to
her
friends
when
they
chose
to
keep
her
company
but
lessons
were
taken
elsewhere
in
the
library
or
the
or
more
frequently
her
grandmother
wherever
or
whatever
lindsay
or
lady
keith
was
always
present
ellen
was
the
plaything
pride
and
delight
of
the
whole
family
not
so
much
however
lady
keith
plaything
as
her
pride
while
pride
had
a
less
share
in
the
affection
of
the
other
two
or
rather
perhaps
was
more
overtopped
by
it
ellen
felt
however
that
all
their
hearts
were
set
upon
her
felt
it
gratefully
and
determined
she
would
give
them
all
the
pleasure
she
possibly
could
her
love
for
other
friends
friends
that
they
knew
nothing
of
friends
was
she
knew
the
sore
point
with
them
she
resolved
not
to
speak
of
those
friends
nor
allude
to
them
especially
in
any
way
that
would
show
how
much
of
her
heart
was
out
of
scotland
but
this
wise
resolution
it
was
very
hard
for
poor
ellen
to
keep
she
was
unaccustomed
to
concealments
and
in
ways
that
she
could
neither
foresee
nor
prevent
the
unwelcome
truth
would
come
up
and
the
sore
was
not
healed
one
day
ellen
had
a
headache
and
was
sent
to
lie
down
alone
and
quietly
stretched
on
her
bed
very
naturally
ellen
thoughts
went
back
to
the
last
time
she
had
had
a
headache
as
she
always
called
it
to
herself
she
recalled
with
a
straitened
heart
the
gentle
and
tender
manner
of
john
care
for
her
how
nicely
he
had
placed
her
on
the
sofa
how
he
sat
by
her
side
bathing
her
temples
or
laying
his
cool
hand
on
her
forehead
and
once
she
remembered
his
lips
i
wonder
thought
ellen
what
i
ever
did
to
make
him
love
me
so
much
as
i
know
he
does
she
remembered
how
when
she
was
able
to
listen
he
still
sat
beside
her
talking
such
sweet
words
of
kindness
and
comfort
and
amusement
that
she
almost
loved
to
be
sick
to
have
such
tending
and
looked
up
at
him
as
at
an
angel
she
felt
it
all
over
again
unfortunately
after
she
had
fallen
asleep
lindsay
came
in
to
see
how
she
was
and
two
tears
the
last
pair
of
them
were
slowly
making
their
way
down
her
cheeks
her
grandmother
saw
them
and
did
not
rest
till
she
knew
the
cause
ellen
was
extremely
sorry
to
tell
she
did
her
best
to
get
off
from
it
but
she
did
not
know
how
to
evade
questions
and
those
that
were
put
to
her
indeed
admitted
of
no
evasion
a
few
days
later
just
after
they
came
to
edinburgh
it
was
remarked
one
morning
at
breakfast
that
ellen
was
very
straight
and
carried
herself
well
it
is
no
thanks
to
me
said
ellen
smiling
they
never
would
let
me
hold
myself
who
is
said
lady
keith
my
brother
and
sister
i
wish
george
said
lady
keith
discontentedly
that
you
would
lay
your
commands
upon
ellen
to
use
that
form
of
expression
no
more
my
ears
are
absolutely
sick
of
it
you
do
not
hear
it
very
often
aunt
keith
ellen
could
not
help
saying
quite
often
enough
and
i
know
it
is
upon
your
lips
a
thousand
times
when
you
do
not
speak
it
and
if
ellen
does
we
do
not
said
lindsay
wish
to
claim
kindred
with
all
the
world
how
came
you
to
take
up
such
an
absurd
habit
said
lady
keith
it
is
like
you
they
took
it
up
first
said
ellen
i
was
too
glad
yes
i
daresay
they
had
their
reasons
for
taking
it
up
said
her
aunt
they
had
acted
from
interested
motives
no
doubt
people
always
do
you
are
very
much
mistaken
aunt
keith
said
ellen
with
uncontrollable
feeling
you
do
not
in
the
least
know
what
you
are
talking
about
instantly
lindsay
fingers
tapped
her
lips
ellen
coloured
painfully
but
after
an
instant
hesitation
she
said
i
beg
your
pardon
aunt
keith
i
should
not
have
said
that
very
well
said
lindsay
but
understand
ellen
however
you
may
have
taken
it
up
this
habit
you
will
lay
it
down
for
the
future
let
us
hear
no
more
of
brothers
and
sisters
can
not
as
your
grandmother
says
fraternise
with
all
the
world
especially
with
unknown
relations
i
am
very
glad
you
have
made
that
regulation
said
lindsay
i
can
not
conceive
how
ellen
has
got
such
a
way
of
it
said
lady
keith
it
is
very
natural
said
ellen
with
some
huskiness
of
voice
that
i
should
say
so
because
i
feel
so
you
do
not
mean
to
say
said
lindsay
that
this
and
miss
somebody
these
people
i
do
know
their
names
there
is
only
one
now
sir
this
person
you
call
your
brother
do
you
mean
to
say
you
have
the
same
regard
for
him
as
if
he
had
been
born
so
no
said
ellen
cheek
and
eye
suddenly
firing
but
a
thousand
times
more
she
was
exceedingly
sorry
the
next
minute
after
she
had
said
this
for
she
knew
it
had
given
both
pain
and
displeasure
in
a
great
degree
no
answer
was
made
ellen
dared
not
look
at
anybody
and
needed
not
she
wished
the
silence
might
be
broken
but
nothing
was
heard
except
a
low
whew
from
lindsay
till
he
rose
up
and
left
the
room
ellen
was
sure
he
was
very
much
displeased
even
the
ladies
were
too
much
offended
to
speak
on
the
subject
and
she
was
merely
bade
to
go
to
her
room
she
went
there
and
sitting
down
on
the
floor
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
what
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
do
she
said
to
herself
i
never
shall
govern
this
tongue
of
mine
oh
i
wish
i
had
not
said
that
they
never
will
forgive
it
what
i
do
to
make
them
pleased
with
me
again
shall
i
go
to
my
father
study
and
beg
him
but
i
ca
ask
him
to
forgive
me
i
have
done
wrong
i
ca
unsay
what
i
said
i
can
do
nothing
i
can
only
go
in
the
way
of
my
duty
and
do
the
best
i
can
and
maybe
they
will
come
round
again
but
oh
dear
a
flood
of
tears
followed
this
resolution
ellen
kept
it
she
tried
to
be
blameless
in
all
her
work
and
behaviour
but
she
sorrowfully
felt
that
her
friends
did
not
forgive
her
there
was
a
cool
air
of
displeasure
about
all
they
said
and
did
the
hand
of
fondness
was
not
laid
upon
her
shoulder
she
was
not
wrapped
in
loving
arms
as
she
used
to
be
a
dozen
times
a
day
no
kisses
fell
on
her
brow
or
lips
ellen
felt
it
more
from
lindsay
than
both
the
others
her
spirits
sank
she
had
been
forbidden
to
speak
of
her
absent
friends
but
that
was
not
the
way
to
make
her
forget
them
and
there
was
scarce
a
minute
in
the
day
when
her
brother
was
not
present
to
her
thoughts
sunday
came
her
first
sunday
in
edinburgh
all
went
to
church
in
the
morning
in
the
afternoon
ellen
found
that
nobody
was
going
her
grandmother
was
lying
down
she
asked
permission
to
go
alone
do
you
want
to
go
because
you
think
you
must
or
for
pleasure
said
lindsay
for
pleasure
said
ellen
tongue
her
eyes
opening
at
the
same
time
you
may
go
with
eager
delight
ellen
got
ready
and
was
hastening
along
the
hall
to
the
door
when
she
met
lindsay
where
are
you
going
to
church
sir
alone
what
do
you
want
to
go
for
no
no
i
sha
let
you
come
in
here
i
want
you
with
me
you
have
been
once
already
you
you
do
not
want
to
go
again
i
do
indeed
sir
very
much
said
ellen
as
she
reluctantly
followed
him
into
the
library
if
you
have
no
objection
you
know
i
have
not
seen
edinburgh
yet
edinburgh
that
true
so
you
have
said
he
looking
at
her
discomfited
face
well
go
if
you
want
to
go
so
much
ellen
got
to
the
hall
door
no
further
she
rushed
back
to
the
library
i
did
not
say
right
when
i
said
that
she
burst
forth
that
was
not
the
reason
i
wanted
to
go
i
will
stay
if
you
wish
me
sir
i
do
wish
it
said
he
in
surprise
i
do
know
what
you
mean
i
am
willing
you
should
go
if
you
like
it
away
with
you
it
is
time
once
more
ellen
set
out
but
this
time
with
a
heart
full
much
too
full
to
think
of
anything
she
saw
by
the
way
it
was
with
a
singular
feeling
of
pleasure
that
she
entered
the
church
alone
it
was
a
strange
church
to
her
never
seen
but
once
before
and
as
she
softly
passed
up
the
broad
aisle
she
saw
nothing
in
the
building
or
the
people
around
her
that
was
not
strange
no
familiar
face
no
familiar
thing
but
it
was
a
church
and
she
was
alone
quite
alone
in
the
midst
of
that
crowd
and
she
went
up
to
the
empty
pew
and
ensconced
herself
in
the
far
corner
of
it
with
a
curious
feeling
of
quiet
and
of
being
at
home
she
was
no
sooner
seated
however
than
leaning
forward
as
much
as
possible
to
screen
herself
from
observation
bending
her
head
upon
her
knees
she
burst
into
an
agony
of
tears
it
was
a
great
relief
to
be
able
to
weep
freely
at
home
she
was
afraid
of
being
seen
or
heard
or
questioned
now
she
was
alone
and
free
and
she
poured
out
her
very
heart
in
weeping
that
she
with
difficulty
kept
from
being
loud
weeping
oh
how
could
i
say
that
how
could
i
say
that
oh
what
john
have
thought
of
me
if
he
had
heard
it
am
i
beginning
already
to
lose
my
truth
am
i
going
backward
already
oh
what
shall
i
do
what
will
become
of
me
if
i
do
not
watch
over
myself
there
is
no
one
to
help
me
or
lead
me
right
not
a
single
one
all
to
lead
me
wrong
what
will
become
of
me
but
there
is
one
who
has
promised
to
keep
those
that
follow
him
he
is
sufficient
without
any
others
i
have
not
kept
near
enough
to
him
that
is
it
i
have
not
remembered
nor
loved
him
ye
love
me
keep
my
commandments
i
have
not
i
have
not
oh
but
i
will
i
will
and
he
will
be
with
me
and
help
me
and
bless
me
and
all
will
go
right
with
me
with
bitter
tears
ellen
mingled
as
eager
prayers
for
forgiveness
and
help
to
be
faithful
she
resolved
that
nothing
come
what
would
should
tempt
her
to
swerve
one
iota
from
the
straight
line
of
truth
she
resolved
to
be
more
careful
of
her
private
hour
she
thought
she
had
scarcely
had
her
full
hour
a
day
lately
she
resolved
to
make
the
bible
her
only
and
her
constant
rule
of
life
in
everything
and
she
prayed
such
prayers
as
a
heart
thoroughly
in
earnest
can
pray
for
the
seal
to
these
resolutions
not
one
word
of
the
sermon
did
ellen
hear
but
she
never
passed
a
more
profitable
hour
in
church
in
her
life
her
tears
were
not
from
the
spring
of
these
thoughts
and
feelings
some
were
the
pouring
out
of
the
gathered
sadness
of
the
week
some
came
from
recollections
oh
how
tender
and
strong
of
lost
and
distant
friends
her
mother
and
alice
and
humphreys
and
margery
and
van
brunt
and
george
marshman
and
she
longed
with
longing
that
seemed
as
if
it
would
have
burst
her
heart
to
see
her
brother
she
longed
for
the
pleasant
voice
the
eye
of
thousand
expressions
into
which
she
always
looked
as
if
she
had
never
seen
it
before
the
calm
look
that
told
he
was
satisfied
with
her
the
touch
of
his
hand
which
many
a
time
had
said
a
volume
ellen
thought
she
would
give
anything
in
the
world
to
see
him
and
hear
him
speak
one
word
as
this
could
not
be
she
resolved
with
the
greatest
care
to
do
what
would
please
him
that
when
she
did
see
him
he
might
find
her
all
he
wished
she
had
wept
herself
out
she
had
refreshed
and
strengthened
herself
by
fleeing
to
the
stronghold
of
the
prisoners
of
hope
and
when
the
last
hymn
was
given
out
she
raised
her
head
and
took
the
book
to
find
it
to
her
great
surprise
she
saw
lindsay
sitting
at
the
other
end
of
the
pew
with
folded
arms
like
a
man
not
thinking
of
what
was
going
on
around
him
ellen
was
startled
but
obeying
the
instinct
that
told
her
what
he
would
like
she
immediately
moved
down
the
pew
and
stood
beside
him
while
the
last
hymn
was
singing
and
if
ellen
had
joined
in
no
other
part
of
the
service
that
afternoon
she
at
least
did
in
that
with
all
her
heart
they
walked
home
then
without
a
word
on
either
side
lindsay
did
not
quit
her
hand
till
he
had
drawn
her
into
the
library
there
he
threw
off
her
bonnet
and
wrappers
and
taking
her
in
his
arms
exclaimed
my
poor
little
darling
what
was
the
matter
with
you
this
afternoon
there
was
so
much
of
kindness
again
in
his
tone
that
overjoyed
ellen
eagerly
returned
his
caress
and
assured
him
that
there
was
nothing
the
matter
with
her
now
nothing
the
matter
said
he
tenderly
pressing
her
face
against
his
own
nothing
the
matter
with
these
pale
cheeks
and
wet
eyes
nothing
ellen
only
that
i
am
so
glad
to
hear
you
speak
kindly
to
me
again
sir
kindly
i
will
never
speak
any
way
but
kindly
to
you
daughter
come
i
will
not
have
any
more
tears
you
have
shed
enough
for
i
am
sure
lift
up
your
face
and
i
will
kiss
them
away
what
was
the
matter
with
you
my
child
but
he
had
to
wait
a
little
while
for
an
answer
what
was
it
ellen
one
thing
said
ellen
i
was
sorry
for
what
i
had
said
to
you
sir
just
before
i
went
out
what
was
that
i
do
not
remember
anything
that
deserved
to
be
a
cause
of
grief
i
told
you
sir
when
i
wanted
you
to
let
me
go
to
church
that
i
had
seen
edinburgh
yet
well
well
sir
that
was
being
quite
true
and
i
was
very
sorry
for
it
not
true
yes
it
was
what
do
you
mean
you
had
seen
edinburgh
no
sir
but
i
mean
was
true
but
i
said
it
to
make
you
believe
what
was
true
how
i
meant
you
to
think
sir
that
that
was
the
reason
why
i
wanted
to
go
to
church
to
see
the
city
and
the
new
sights
and
it
was
at
all
what
was
it
then
ellen
hesitated
i
always
love
to
go
sir
and
besides
i
believe
i
wanted
to
be
alone
and
you
were
not
after
all
said
lindsay
again
pressing
her
cheek
to
his
for
i
followed
you
there
but
ellen
my
child
you
were
troubled
without
reason
you
had
said
nothing
that
was
false
ah
sir
but
i
had
made
you
believe
what
was
false
upon
my
word
said
lindsay
you
are
a
nice
reasoner
and
are
you
always
true
upon
this
close
scale
i
wish
i
was
sir
but
you
see
i
am
not
i
am
sure
i
hate
everything
else
well
i
will
not
quarrel
with
you
for
being
true
said
lindsay
i
wish
there
was
a
little
more
of
it
in
the
world
was
this
the
cause
of
all
those
tears
this
afternoon
no
sir
not
all
what
beside
ellen
ellen
looked
down
and
was
silent
come
i
must
know
must
i
tell
you
all
sir
you
must
indeed
said
he
smiling
i
will
have
the
whole
daughter
i
had
been
feeling
sorry
all
the
week
because
you
and
grandmother
and
aunt
keith
were
displeased
with
me
again
lindsay
silent
caress
in
its
tenderness
seemed
to
say
that
she
should
never
have
the
same
complaint
to
make
again
was
that
all
ellen
as
she
hesitated
no
sir
well
i
wish
you
would
ask
me
further
please
do
not
i
shall
displease
you
again
i
will
not
be
displeased
i
was
thinking
of
humphreys
said
ellen
in
a
low
tone
who
is
that
you
know
sir
you
say
i
must
not
call
him
what
were
you
thinking
of
him
i
was
wishing
very
much
i
could
see
him
again
well
you
a
said
lindsay
or
bolder
than
i
think
you
you
said
you
would
not
be
displeased
sir
neither
will
i
daughter
but
what
shall
i
do
to
make
you
forget
these
people
nothing
sir
i
can
not
forget
them
i
should
deserve
to
have
you
love
me
a
bit
if
i
could
let
me
love
them
and
do
not
be
angry
with
me
for
it
but
i
am
not
satisfied
to
have
your
body
here
and
your
heart
somewhere
else
i
must
have
a
poor
little
kind
of
heart
said
ellen
smiling
amidst
her
tears
if
it
had
room
in
it
for
only
one
person
ellen
said
lindsay
inquisitively
did
you
a
falsehood
there
no
sir
there
is
honesty
in
those
eyes
said
he
if
there
is
honesty
anywhere
in
the
world
i
am
satisfied
that
is
now
lie
there
my
little
daughter
and
rest
said
he
laying
her
upon
the
sofa
you
look
as
if
you
needed
it
i
do
need
anything
now
said
ellen
as
she
laid
her
cheek
upon
the
grateful
pillow
except
one
thing
if
grandmother
would
only
forgive
me
too
you
must
try
not
to
offend
your
grandmother
ellen
for
she
does
not
very
readily
forgive
but
i
think
we
can
arrange
this
matter
go
you
to
sleep
i
wonder
said
ellen
smiling
as
she
closed
her
eyes
why
everybody
calls
me
i
do
think
i
am
very
little
everybody
says
lindsay
thought
he
understood
it
when
a
few
minutes
after
he
sat
watching
her
as
she
really
had
fallen
asleep
the
innocent
brow
the
perfect
sweet
calm
of
the
face
seemed
to
belong
to
much
younger
years
even
lindsay
could
not
help
recollecting
the
comment
heaven
peace
within
scarcely
ellen
own
mother
ever
watched
over
her
with
more
fond
tenderness
than
her
adopted
father
did
now
for
several
days
after
this
he
would
hardly
permit
her
to
leave
him
he
made
her
bring
her
books
and
study
where
he
was
he
went
out
and
came
in
with
her
and
kept
her
by
his
side
whenever
they
joined
the
rest
of
the
family
at
meals
or
in
the
evening
whether
lindsay
intended
it
or
not
this
had
soon
the
effect
to
abate
the
displeasure
of
his
mother
and
sister
ellen
was
almost
taken
out
of
their
hands
and
they
thought
it
expedient
not
to
let
him
have
the
whole
of
her
and
though
ellen
could
better
bear
their
cold
looks
and
words
since
she
had
favour
again
she
was
very
glad
when
they
smiled
upon
her
too
and
went
dancing
about
with
quite
a
happy
face
she
was
now
very
busy
she
had
masters
for
the
piano
and
singing
and
different
branches
of
knowledge
she
went
to
muller
regularly
twice
a
week
and
soon
her
began
she
had
said
no
more
on
the
subject
but
went
quietly
hoping
they
would
find
out
their
mistake
before
long
lady
keith
always
accompanied
her
one
day
ellen
had
ridden
near
her
usual
time
when
a
young
lady
with
whom
she
attended
a
german
class
came
up
to
where
she
was
resting
this
lady
was
several
years
older
than
ellen
but
had
taken
a
fancy
to
her
how
finely
you
got
on
yesterday
said
she
making
us
all
ashamed
ah
i
guess
muller
helped
you
yes
said
ellen
smiling
he
did
help
me
a
little
he
helped
me
with
some
troublesome
pronunciations
with
nothing
else
i
suppose
ah
well
we
must
submit
to
be
stupid
how
do
you
do
i
am
very
tired
miss
gordon
tired
oh
you
not
used
to
it
no
it
is
that
said
ellen
i
used
to
it
that
is
the
reason
i
am
tired
i
am
accustomed
to
ride
up
and
down
the
country
at
any
pace
i
like
and
it
is
very
tiresome
to
walk
stupidly
round
and
round
for
an
hour
but
do
you
know
how
to
manage
a
horse
i
thought
you
were
only
just
beginning
to
learn
oh
no
i
have
been
learning
this
great
while
only
they
do
think
i
know
how
and
they
have
never
seen
me
are
you
just
come
miss
gordon
yes
and
they
are
bringing
out
sophronisbe
for
me
do
you
know
sophronisbe
look
that
light
grey
is
she
beautiful
she
the
loveliest
creature
in
the
whole
stud
oh
i
know
said
ellen
i
saw
you
on
her
the
other
day
she
went
charmingly
how
long
shall
i
be
kept
walking
here
miss
gordon
why
i
do
know
i
should
think
they
would
find
out
what
does
de
courcy
say
to
you
oh
he
comes
and
looks
at
me
and
says
bien
très
bien
and
comme
ça
and
then
he
walks
off
well
i
declare
that
is
too
bad
said
miss
gordon
laughing
look
here
i
got
a
good
thought
in
my
head
suppose
you
mount
sophronisbe
in
my
place
without
saying
anything
to
anybody
and
let
them
see
what
you
are
up
to
can
you
trust
yourself
she
very
spirited
i
could
trust
myself
said
ellen
but
thank
you
i
think
i
had
better
not
afraid
no
not
at
all
but
my
aunt
and
father
would
not
like
it
nonsense
how
should
they
dislike
it
there
no
sort
of
danger
you
know
come
i
thought
you
sat
wonderfully
for
a
beginner
i
am
surprised
de
courcy
had
better
eyes
i
guess
you
have
learned
german
before
ellen
come
will
you
but
ellen
declined
preferring
her
plodding
walk
round
the
ring
to
any
putting
of
herself
forward
presently
lindsay
came
in
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
been
there
his
eyes
soon
singled
out
ellen
my
daughter
sits
well
he
remarked
to
the
a
merveille
mademoiselle
lindsay
does
ride
remarquablement
pour
une
beginner
qui
ne
fait
que
commencer
would
it
be
possible
that
she
has
had
no
lessons
before
why
yes
she
has
had
lessons
of
what
sort
i
do
know
said
lindsay
going
up
to
ellen
how
do
you
like
it
ellen
i
do
like
it
at
all
sir
i
thought
you
were
so
fond
of
riding
i
do
call
this
riding
sir
ha
what
you
call
riding
here
de
courcy
wo
you
have
the
goodness
to
put
this
young
lady
on
another
horse
and
see
if
she
knows
anything
about
handling
him
with
great
pleasure
de
courcy
would
do
anything
that
was
requested
of
him
ellen
was
taken
out
of
the
ring
of
walkers
and
mounted
on
a
fine
animal
and
set
by
herself
to
have
her
skill
tried
in
as
many
various
ways
as
de
courcy
ingenuity
could
point
out
never
did
she
bear
herself
more
erectly
never
were
her
hand
and
her
horse
mouth
on
nicer
terms
of
acquaintanceship
never
even
to
please
her
master
had
she
so
given
her
whole
soul
to
the
single
business
of
managing
her
horse
and
herself
perfectly
well
she
knew
as
little
as
she
cared
that
a
number
of
persons
besides
her
friends
were
standing
to
look
at
her
she
thought
of
only
two
people
there
lindsay
and
her
aunt
and
the
as
his
opinion
might
affect
theirs
très
bien
très
bien
he
muttered
parfaitement
monsieur
mademoiselle
votre
fille
has
had
good
lessons
voilà
qui
est
entièrement
comme
il
faut
assez
bien
said
lindsay
smiling
the
little
gipsy
mademoiselle
said
the
as
she
paused
before
them
pourquoi
wherefore
have
you
stopped
in
your
canter
tantôt
a
little
while
ago
et
puis
récommencé
monsieur
he
led
with
the
wrong
foot
ça
justement
he
exclaimed
have
you
practised
leaping
ellen
yes
sir
try
her
de
courcy
how
high
will
you
go
ellen
as
high
as
you
please
sir
said
ellen
leaning
over
and
patting
her
horse
neck
to
hide
her
smile
how
you
look
child
said
lindsay
in
a
pleased
tone
so
is
what
you
call
riding
it
is
a
little
more
like
it
sir
ellen
was
tried
with
standing
and
running
leaps
higher
and
higher
till
lindsay
would
have
no
more
of
it
and
de
courcy
assured
him
that
his
daughter
had
been
taught
by
a
very
accomplished
rider
and
there
was
little
or
nothing
left
for
him
to
do
il
pouvait
plus
but
he
should
be
very
happy
to
have
her
come
there
to
practise
and
show
an
example
to
his
pupils
the
very
bright
colour
in
ellen
face
as
she
heard
this
might
have
been
mistaken
for
the
flush
of
gratified
vanity
it
was
nothing
less
not
one
word
of
this
praise
did
she
take
to
herself
nor
had
she
sought
for
herself
it
was
all
for
somebody
else
and
perhaps
so
lady
keith
understood
it
for
she
looked
rather
discomfited
but
lindsay
was
exceedingly
pleased
and
promised
ellen
that
as
soon
as
the
warm
weather
came
she
should
have
a
horse
and
rides
to
her
heart
content
chapter
l
she
was
his
care
his
hope
and
his
delight
most
in
his
thought
and
ever
in
his
sight
dryden
ellen
might
now
have
been
in
some
danger
of
being
spoiled
not
indeed
with
for
that
was
not
the
temper
of
the
family
but
from
finding
herself
a
person
of
so
much
consequence
she
could
not
but
feel
that
in
the
minds
of
every
one
of
her
three
friends
she
was
the
object
of
greatest
importance
their
thoughts
and
care
were
principally
occupied
with
her
even
lady
keith
was
perpetually
watching
superintending
and
admonishing
though
she
every
now
and
then
remarked
with
a
kind
of
surprise
that
really
she
scarcely
ever
had
to
say
anything
to
ellen
she
thought
she
must
know
things
by
instinct
to
lindsay
and
his
mother
she
was
the
idol
of
life
and
except
when
by
chance
her
will
might
cross
theirs
she
had
what
she
wished
and
did
what
she
pleased
but
ellen
happily
had
two
safeguards
which
effectually
kept
her
from
pride
or
presumption
one
was
her
love
for
her
brother
and
longing
remembrance
of
him
there
was
no
one
to
take
his
place
not
indeed
in
her
affections
for
that
would
have
been
impossible
but
in
the
daily
course
of
her
life
she
missed
him
in
everything
she
had
abundance
of
kindness
and
fondness
shown
her
but
the
was
wanting
she
was
talked
but
not
no
one
now
knew
always
what
she
was
thinking
of
nor
if
they
did
would
patiently
draw
out
her
thoughts
canvass
them
set
them
right
or
show
them
wrong
no
one
now
could
tell
what
she
was
nor
had
the
art
sweetly
in
a
way
she
scarce
knew
how
to
do
away
with
sadness
or
dulness
or
perverseness
and
leave
her
spirits
clear
and
bright
as
the
noonday
with
all
the
petting
and
fondness
she
had
from
her
new
friends
ellen
felt
alone
she
was
petted
and
fondled
as
a
darling
possession
a
dear
plaything
a
thing
to
be
cared
for
taught
governed
disposed
of
with
the
greatest
affection
and
delight
but
john
was
a
higher
style
of
kindness
that
entered
into
all
her
innermost
feelings
and
wants
and
his
was
a
higher
style
of
authority
too
that
reached
where
theirs
could
never
attain
an
authority
ellen
always
felt
it
utterly
impossible
to
dispute
it
was
sure
to
be
exerted
on
the
side
of
what
was
right
and
she
could
better
have
borne
hard
words
from
lindsay
than
a
glance
of
her
brother
eye
ellen
made
no
objection
to
the
imperativeness
of
her
new
guardians
it
seldom
was
called
up
so
as
to
trouble
her
and
she
was
not
of
late
particularly
fond
of
having
her
own
way
but
she
sometimes
drew
comparisons
i
could
not
any
sooner
i
could
not
as
soon
have
disobeyed
john
and
yet
he
never
would
have
spoken
to
me
as
they
do
if
i
had
pride
perhaps
she
said
remembering
dundas
words
i
should
say
a
great
deal
john
is
proud
and
yet
i
do
know
he
is
proud
as
they
are
i
wish
i
knew
what
kinds
of
pride
are
right
and
what
wrong
he
would
tell
me
if
he
was
here
what
are
you
in
a
study
about
ellen
said
lindsay
i
was
thinking
sir
about
different
kinds
of
pride
i
wish
i
knew
the
right
from
the
wrong
or
is
there
any
good
kind
all
good
ellen
all
good
said
lindsay
provided
you
do
not
have
too
much
of
it
would
you
like
me
to
be
proud
sir
yes
said
he
laughing
and
pinching
her
cheek
as
proud
as
you
like
if
you
only
do
let
me
see
any
of
it
not
very
satisfactory
but
that
was
the
way
with
the
few
questions
of
any
magnitude
ellen
ventured
to
ask
she
was
kissed
and
laughed
at
called
metaphysical
or
philosophical
and
dismissed
with
no
light
on
the
subject
she
sighed
for
her
brother
the
hours
with
muller
were
the
best
substitute
she
had
they
were
dearly
prized
by
her
and
to
say
truth
by
him
he
had
no
family
he
lived
alone
and
the
visits
of
his
docile
and
intelligent
little
pupil
became
very
pleasant
breaks
in
the
monotony
of
his
home
life
truly
and
benevolent
and
a
true
lover
of
knowledge
he
delighted
to
impart
it
ellen
soon
found
she
might
ask
him
as
many
questions
as
she
pleased
that
were
at
all
proper
to
the
subject
they
were
upon
and
he
amused
and
interested
was
equally
able
and
willing
to
answer
her
often
when
not
particularly
busy
he
allowed
her
hour
to
become
two
excellent
hours
for
ellen
muller
had
made
his
proposition
to
lindsay
partly
from
grateful
regard
for
him
and
partly
to
gratify
the
fancy
he
had
taken
to
ellen
on
account
of
her
simplicity
intelligence
and
good
manners
this
latter
motive
did
not
disappoint
him
he
grew
very
much
attached
to
his
little
pupil
an
attachment
which
ellen
faithfully
returned
both
in
kind
and
by
every
trifling
service
that
it
could
fall
in
her
way
to
render
him
fine
flowers
and
fruit
that
it
was
her
special
delight
to
carry
to
muller
little
jobs
of
copying
or
setting
in
order
some
disorderly
matters
in
his
rooms
where
he
soon
would
trust
her
to
do
anything
or
a
book
from
her
father
library
and
once
or
twice
when
he
was
indisposed
reading
to
him
as
she
did
by
the
hour
patiently
matters
that
could
neither
interest
nor
concern
her
on
the
whole
and
with
good
reason
the
days
when
they
were
to
meet
were
hailed
with
as
much
pleasure
perhaps
by
muller
as
by
ellen
herself
her
other
safeguard
was
the
precious
hour
alone
which
she
had
promised
john
never
to
lose
when
she
could
help
it
the
only
time
she
could
have
was
the
early
morning
before
the
rest
of
the
family
were
up
to
this
hour
and
it
was
often
more
than
an
hour
ellen
was
faithful
her
little
bible
was
extremely
precious
now
ellen
had
never
gone
to
it
with
a
deeper
sense
of
need
and
never
did
she
find
more
comfort
in
being
able
to
disburden
her
heart
in
prayer
of
its
load
of
cares
and
wishes
never
more
than
now
had
she
felt
the
preciousness
of
that
friend
who
draws
closer
to
his
children
the
closer
they
draw
to
him
she
had
never
realised
more
the
joy
of
having
him
to
go
to
it
was
her
special
delight
to
pray
for
those
loved
ones
she
could
do
nothing
else
for
it
was
a
joy
to
think
that
he
who
hears
prayer
is
equally
present
with
all
his
people
and
that
though
thousands
of
miles
lie
between
the
petitioner
and
the
petitioned
for
the
breath
of
prayer
may
span
the
distance
and
pour
blessings
on
the
head
the
burden
of
thoughts
and
affections
gathered
during
the
hours
was
laid
down
in
the
and
ellen
could
meet
her
friends
at
the
with
a
sunshiny
face
little
they
thought
where
her
heart
had
been
or
where
it
had
got
its
sunshine
but
notwithstanding
this
ellen
had
too
much
to
remember
and
regret
than
to
be
otherwise
than
sober
soberer
than
her
friends
liked
they
noticed
with
sorrow
that
the
sunshine
wore
off
as
the
day
rolled
on
that
though
ready
to
smile
upon
occasion
her
face
always
settled
again
into
a
gravity
they
thought
altogether
unsuitable
lindsay
fancied
she
knew
the
cause
and
resolved
to
break
it
up
from
the
first
of
ellen
coming
her
grandmother
had
taken
the
entire
charge
of
her
toilet
whatever
lindsay
notions
in
general
might
be
as
to
the
propriety
of
young
girls
learning
to
take
care
of
themselves
ellen
was
much
too
precious
a
plaything
to
be
trusted
to
any
other
hands
even
her
own
at
eleven
regularly
every
day
she
went
to
her
grandmother
for
a
very
elaborate
bathing
and
dressing
though
not
a
very
long
one
for
all
lindsay
acts
were
energetic
now
without
any
hint
as
to
the
reason
she
was
directed
to
come
to
her
grandmother
an
hour
before
the
breakfast
time
to
go
through
then
the
course
of
sponging
and
that
lindsay
was
accustomed
to
administer
at
eleven
ellen
heard
in
silence
and
obeyed
but
made
up
her
hour
by
rising
earlier
than
usual
so
as
to
have
it
before
going
to
her
grandmother
it
was
a
little
difficult
at
first
but
she
soon
got
into
the
habit
of
it
though
the
mornings
were
dark
and
cold
after
a
while
it
chanced
that
this
came
to
lindsay
ears
and
ellen
was
told
to
come
to
her
as
soon
as
she
was
out
of
bed
in
the
morning
but
grandmother
said
ellen
i
am
up
a
great
while
before
you
i
should
find
you
asleep
do
i
come
soon
enough
what
do
you
get
up
so
early
for
you
know
i
told
you
some
time
ago
i
want
some
time
to
myself
it
is
not
good
for
you
to
be
up
so
long
before
breakfast
and
in
these
cold
mornings
do
not
rise
in
future
till
i
send
for
you
but
grandmother
that
is
the
only
time
for
me
there
is
an
hour
after
breakfast
that
i
can
have
regularly
to
myself
and
i
can
not
be
happy
if
i
do
not
have
some
time
let
it
be
as
i
said
said
lindsay
could
you
let
me
come
to
you
at
eleven
again
grandmother
lindsay
touched
her
lips
a
way
of
silencing
her
that
ellen
particularly
disliked
and
which
both
lindsay
and
his
mother
were
accustomed
to
use
she
thought
a
great
deal
on
the
subject
and
came
soberly
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
her
duty
to
disobey
i
promised
john
she
said
to
herself
i
will
never
break
that
promise
i
do
anything
rather
and
besides
if
i
had
not
it
is
just
as
much
my
duty
a
duty
that
no
one
here
has
a
right
to
command
me
against
i
will
do
what
i
think
right
come
what
may
she
could
not
without
its
coming
to
the
knowledge
of
her
grandmother
a
week
or
rather
two
after
the
former
conversation
lindsay
made
inquiries
of
mason
her
woman
who
was
obliged
to
confess
that
miss
ellen
light
was
always
burning
when
she
went
to
call
her
ellen
said
lindsay
the
same
day
have
you
obeyed
me
in
what
i
told
you
the
other
morning
about
lying
in
bed
till
you
are
sent
for
no
you
are
frank
to
venture
to
tell
me
so
why
have
you
disobeyed
me
because
grandmother
i
thought
it
was
right
you
think
it
is
right
to
disobey
do
you
yes
if
if
what
i
mean
grandmother
there
is
one
i
must
obey
even
before
you
if
what
repeated
lindsay
please
do
not
ask
me
grandmother
i
do
want
to
say
that
say
it
at
once
ellen
i
think
it
is
right
to
disobey
if
i
am
told
to
do
what
is
wrong
said
ellen
in
a
low
voice
are
you
to
be
the
judge
of
right
and
wrong
no
who
then
the
bible
i
do
not
know
what
is
the
reason
said
lindsay
that
i
can
not
be
very
angry
with
you
ellen
i
repeat
the
order
i
gave
you
the
other
day
promise
me
to
obey
i
can
not
grandmother
i
have
that
hour
i
can
not
do
without
it
so
must
i
be
obeyed
i
assure
you
ellen
you
will
sleep
in
my
room
henceforth
ellen
heard
her
in
despair
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
was
not
to
be
thought
of
there
was
as
she
said
no
time
she
could
count
upon
after
breakfast
during
the
whole
day
and
evening
she
was
either
busy
with
her
studies
or
masters
or
in
the
company
of
her
grandmother
or
lindsay
and
if
not
there
liable
to
be
called
to
them
at
any
moment
her
grandmother
expedient
for
increasing
her
cheerfulness
had
marvellous
ellen
drooped
under
the
sense
of
wrong
as
well
as
the
loss
of
her
greatest
comfort
for
two
days
she
felt
and
looked
forlorn
and
smiling
now
seemed
to
be
a
difficult
matter
lindsay
happened
to
be
remarkably
busy
those
two
days
so
that
he
did
not
notice
what
was
going
on
at
the
end
of
them
however
in
the
evening
he
called
ellen
to
him
and
whisperingly
asked
what
was
the
matter
nothing
sir
said
ellen
only
grandmother
will
not
let
me
do
something
i
can
not
be
happy
without
doing
is
it
one
of
the
things
you
want
to
do
because
it
is
right
whether
it
is
convenient
or
not
he
asked
smiling
ellen
could
not
smile
oh
father
she
whispered
putting
her
face
close
to
his
if
you
would
only
get
grandmother
to
let
me
do
it
the
words
were
spoken
with
a
sob
and
lindsay
felt
her
warm
tears
upon
his
neck
he
had
however
far
too
much
respect
for
his
mother
to
say
anything
against
her
proceedings
while
ellen
was
present
he
simply
answered
that
she
must
do
whatever
her
grandmother
said
but
when
ellen
had
left
the
room
which
she
did
immediately
he
took
the
matter
up
lindsay
explained
and
insisted
that
ellen
was
spoiling
herself
for
life
and
the
world
by
a
set
of
dull
religious
notions
that
were
utterly
unfit
for
a
child
that
she
would
very
soon
get
over
thinking
about
her
habit
of
morning
prayer
and
would
then
do
much
better
lindsay
looked
grave
but
with
ellen
tears
yet
wet
upon
his
cheek
he
could
not
dismiss
the
matter
so
lightly
and
persisted
in
desiring
that
his
mother
should
give
up
the
point
which
she
utterly
refused
to
do
ellen
meanwhile
had
fled
to
her
own
room
the
moonlight
was
quietly
streaming
in
through
the
casement
it
looked
to
her
like
an
old
friend
she
threw
herself
down
on
the
floor
close
by
the
glass
and
after
some
tears
which
she
could
not
help
shedding
she
raised
her
head
and
looked
thoughtfully
out
it
was
very
seldom
now
that
she
had
a
chance
of
the
kind
she
was
rarely
alone
but
when
she
was
busy
i
wonder
if
that
same
moon
is
this
minute
shining
in
at
the
glass
door
at
home
no
to
be
sure
it
ca
this
minute
what
am
i
thinking
of
but
it
was
there
or
will
be
there
let
me
see
east
west
it
was
there
some
time
this
morning
i
suppose
looking
right
into
our
old
oh
moon
i
wish
i
was
in
your
place
for
once
to
look
in
there
too
but
it
is
all
empty
now
there
nobody
there
humphreys
would
be
in
his
study
how
lonely
how
lonely
he
must
be
oh
i
wish
i
was
back
there
with
him
john
is
there
though
no
matter
he
will
be
and
i
could
do
so
much
for
humphreys
in
the
meanwhile
he
must
miss
me
i
wonder
where
john
is
nobody
writes
to
me
i
should
think
some
one
might
i
wonder
if
i
am
ever
to
see
them
again
oh
he
will
come
to
see
me
surely
before
he
goes
home
but
then
he
will
have
to
go
away
without
me
again
i
am
fast
now
fast
enough
but
oh
am
i
to
be
separated
from
them
for
ever
well
i
shall
see
them
in
heaven
it
was
a
well
of
bitter
acquiescence
and
washed
down
with
bitter
tears
is
it
my
bonny
miss
ellen
said
the
voice
of
the
housekeeper

my
ain
bairn
ellen
returned
heartily
and
silently
the
embrace
of
the
old
scotchwoman
and
when
she
left
her
set
herself
to
follow
her
advice
she
tried
to
gather
her
scattered
thoughts
and
smooth
her
ruffled
feelings
in
using
this
quiet
time
to
the
best
advantage
at
the
end
of
she
felt
like
another
creature
and
began
to
refresh
herself
with
softly
singing
some
of
her
old
hymns
the
argument
which
was
carried
on
in
the
parlour
sank
at
length
into
silence
without
coming
to
any
conclusion
where
is
miss
ellen
lindsay
asked
of
a
servant
that
came
in
she
is
up
in
her
room
singing
tell
her
i
want
her
no
stop
said
lindsay
i
go
myself
her
door
was
a
little
ajar
and
he
softly
opened
it
without
disturbing
her
ellen
was
still
sitting
on
the
floor
before
the
window
looking
out
through
it
and
in
rather
a
low
tone
singing
the
last
verse
of
the
hymn
rock
of
ages
while
i
draw
this
fleeting
breath
when
my
eyelids
close
in
death
when
i
rise
to
worlds
unknown
and
behold
thee
on
thy
throne
rock
of
ages
cleft
for
me
let
me
hide
myself
in
thee
lindsay
stood
still
at
the
door
ellen
paused
a
minute
and
then
sang
jerusalem
my
happy
home
her
utterance
was
so
distinct
that
he
heard
every
word
he
did
not
move
till
she
had
finished
and
then
he
came
softly
in
singing
songs
to
the
moon
ellen
ellen
started
and
got
up
from
the
floor
no
sir
i
was
singing
them
to
myself
not
entirely
for
i
heard
the
last
one
why
do
you
make
yourself
sober
singing
such
sad
things
i
do
sir
they
are
not
sad
to
me
they
are
delightful
i
love
them
dearly
how
came
you
to
love
them
it
is
not
natural
for
a
child
of
your
age
what
do
you
love
them
for
my
little
daughter
oh
sir
there
are
a
great
many
reasons
i
do
know
how
many
i
will
have
patience
ellen
i
want
to
hear
them
all
i
love
them
because
i
love
to
think
of
the
things
the
hymns
are
about
i
love
the
tunes
dearly
and
i
like
both
the
words
and
the
tunes
better
i
believe
because
i
have
sung
them
so
often
with
friends
humph
i
guessed
as
much
is
that
the
strongest
reason
of
the
three
i
do
know
sir
i
do
think
it
is
is
all
your
heart
in
america
ellen
or
have
you
any
left
to
bestow
on
us
yes
sir
not
very
much
i
love
father
said
ellen
laying
her
cheek
gently
alongside
of
his
and
your
grandmother
ellen
said
lindsay
clasping
his
arms
around
her
yes
sir
but
he
well
understood
that
the
yes
was
fainter
and
your
aunt
speak
ellen
i
do
love
her
as
much
as
i
wish
i
did
said
ellen
i
love
her
a
little
i
suppose
oh
why
do
you
ask
me
such
a
hard
question
father
that
is
something
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
said
lindsay
half
laughing
sit
down
here
he
added
placing
her
on
his
knee
and
sing
to
me
again
ellen
was
heartened
by
the
tone
of
his
voice
and
pleased
with
the
request
she
immediately
sang
with
great
spirit
a
little
methodist
hymn
she
had
learned
when
a
mere
child
the
wild
air
and
simple
words
singularly
suited
each
other
o
canaan
bright
canaan
i
am
bound
for
the
land
of
canaan
o
canaan
it
is
my
happy
happy
home
i
am
bound
for
the
land
of
canaan
does
that
sound
sad
sir
why
yes
i
think
it
does
rather
ellen
does
it
make
you
feel
merry
not
sir
it
is
but
i
like
it
very
much
the
tune
or
the
words
both
sir
what
do
you
mean
by
the
land
of
canaan
heaven
sir
and
do
you
like
to
think
about
that
at
your
age
why
certainly
sir
why
not
why
you
because
it
is
a
bright
and
happy
place
said
ellen
gravely
where
there
is
no
darkness
nor
sorrow
nor
death
neither
pain
nor
crying
and
my
mother
is
there
and
my
dear
alice
and
my
saviour
is
there
and
i
hope
i
shall
be
there
too
you
are
shedding
tears
now
ellen
and
if
i
am
sir
it
is
not
because
i
am
unhappy
it
does
make
me
unhappy
to
think
of
these
things
it
makes
me
glad
and
the
more
i
think
of
them
the
happier
i
am
you
are
a
strange
child
i
am
afraid
your
grandmother
is
right
and
that
you
are
hurting
yourself
with
poring
over
serious
matters
that
you
are
too
young
for
she
would
not
think
so
if
she
knew
said
ellen
sighing
i
should
not
be
happy
at
all
without
that
and
you
would
not
love
me
half
so
well
nor
she
either
oh
father
she
exclaimed
pressing
his
hand
in
both
her
own
and
laying
her
face
upon
it
do
not
let
me
be
hindered
in
that
forbid
me
anything
you
please
but
not
that
the
better
i
learn
to
please
my
best
friend
the
better
i
shall
please
you
whom
do
you
mean
by
best
friend
the
lord
my
redeemer
where
did
you
get
these
notions
said
lindsay
after
a
short
pause
from
my
mother
first
sir
she
had
none
of
them
when
i
knew
her
she
had
afterwards
then
sir
and
oh
ellen
hesitated
i
wish
everybody
had
them
too
my
little
daughter
said
lindsay
affectionately
kissing
the
cheeks
and
eyes
which
were
moist
again
i
shall
indulge
you
in
this
matter
but
you
must
keep
your
brow
clear
or
i
shall
revoke
my
grant
and
you
belong
to
me
now
and
there
are
some
things
i
want
you
to
forget
and
not
remember
you
understand
now
do
sing
songs
to
the
moon
any
more
my
daughter
they
think
religion
is
a
strange
melancholy
thing
said
ellen
to
herself
as
she
went
to
bed
i
must
not
give
them
reason
to
think
so
i
must
let
my
rushlight
burn
bright
i
must
take
care
i
never
had
more
need
and
with
an
earnest
prayer
for
help
to
do
so
she
laid
her
head
on
the
pillow
lindsay
told
his
mother
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
let
ellen
have
her
way
for
a
while
and
begged
that
she
might
return
to
her
old
room
and
hours
again
lindsay
would
not
hear
of
it
ellen
had
disobeyed
her
orders
she
said
she
must
take
the
consequences
she
is
a
bold
little
hussy
to
venture
it
said
lindsay
but
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
naughtiness
in
her
heart
no
not
a
bit
i
could
not
be
angry
with
her
it
is
only
those
preposterous
notions
she
has
got
from
somebody
or
other
lindsay
said
no
more
next
morning
he
asked
ellen
privately
what
she
did
the
first
thing
after
breakfast
practise
on
the
piano
for
an
hour
she
said
could
you
do
it
at
any
other
time
yes
sir
i
could
practise
in
the
afternoon
only
grandmother
likes
to
have
me
with
her
let
it
be
done
then
ellen
in
future
and
what
shall
i
do
with
the
hour
after
breakfast
sir
whatever
you
please
said
he
smiling
ellen
thanked
him
in
the
way
she
knew
he
best
liked
and
gratefully
resolved
he
should
have
as
little
cause
as
possible
to
complain
of
her
very
little
cause
indeed
did
he
or
any
one
else
have
no
fault
could
be
found
with
her
performance
of
duty
and
her
cheerfulness
was
constant
and
unvarying
she
remembered
her
brother
recipe
against
loneliness
and
made
use
of
it
she
remembered
allen
advice
and
followed
it
she
grasped
the
promises
he
that
cometh
to
me
shall
never
hunger
and
seek
and
ye
shall
find
precious
words
that
never
yet
disappointed
any
one
and
though
tears
might
often
fall
that
nobody
knew
of
and
she
might
not
be
so
as
her
friends
would
have
liked
to
see
her
though
her
cheerfulness
was
touched
with
sobriety
they
could
not
complain
for
her
brow
was
always
unruffled
her
voice
clear
her
smile
ready
after
a
while
she
was
restored
to
her
own
again
and
permitted
to
take
up
her
former
habits
chapter
li
other
days
come
back
on
me
with
recollected
music
byron
though
nothing
could
be
smoother
than
the
general
course
of
her
life
ellen
principles
were
still
now
and
then
severely
tried
of
all
in
the
house
next
to
lindsay
she
liked
the
company
of
the
old
housekeeper
best
she
was
a
christian
a
most
benevolent
and
and
withal
sensible
and
respectable
person
devotedly
attached
to
the
family
and
very
fond
of
ellen
in
particular
ellen
loved
when
she
could
to
get
alone
with
her
and
hear
her
talk
of
her
mother
young
days
and
she
loved
furthermore
and
almost
as
much
to
talk
to
allen
of
her
own
ellen
could
to
no
one
else
lisp
a
word
on
the
subject
and
without
dwelling
directly
on
those
that
she
loved
she
delighted
to
tell
over
to
an
interested
listener
the
things
she
had
done
seen
and
felt
with
them
i
wish
that
child
was
a
little
more
like
other
people
said
lady
keith
one
evening
in
the
latter
end
of
the
winter
humph
said
lindsay
i
do
remember
at
this
moment
any
one
that
i
think
she
could
resemble
without
losing
more
than
she
gained
oh
it
of
no
use
to
talk
to
you
about
ellen
brother
you
can
take
up
things
fast
enough
when
you
find
them
out
but
you
never
will
see
with
other
people
eyes
what
do
your
eyes
see
catherine
she
is
altogether
too
childish
for
her
years
she
is
really
a
baby
i
do
know
said
lindsay
smiling
you
should
ask
muller
about
that
he
was
holding
forth
to
me
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
other
day
and
could
not
stint
in
her
praises
she
will
go
on
he
says
just
as
fast
as
he
pleases
to
take
her
oh
yes
in
intelligence
and
so
on
i
know
she
is
not
wanting
that
is
not
what
i
mean
she
is
perfectly
ladylike
always
said
lindsay
yes
i
know
that
and
perfectly
childlike
too
i
like
that
said
lindsay
i
have
no
fancy
for
your
little
girls
well
said
lady
keith
in
despair
you
may
like
it
but
i
tell
you
she
is
too
much
of
a
child
nevertheless
in
other
ways
she
has
an
idea
of
a
thousand
things
it
was
only
the
other
day
she
was
setting
out
to
go
at
through
the
streets
with
a
basket
on
her
arm
with
some
of
that
fruit
for
muller
i
believe
if
she
has
any
fault
said
lindsay
it
is
want
of
pride
but
i
do
know
i
ca
say
i
wish
she
had
more
of
it
oh
no
of
course
i
suppose
not
and
it
does
take
anything
at
all
to
make
the
tears
come
in
her
eyes
the
other
day
i
did
know
whether
to
laugh
or
be
vexed
at
the
way
she
went
on
with
a
kitten
for
or
more
i
wish
you
had
seen
her
i
am
not
sure
she
did
cry
over
that
now
i
suppose
the
next
thing
brother
you
will
go
and
make
her
a
present
of
one
if
you
have
no
heavier
charges
to
bring
said
lindsay
smiling
i
take
breath
and
think
about
it
but
she
is
like
anybody
else
she
do
care
for
young
companions
she
do
seem
to
fancy
any
one
out
of
the
family
unless
it
is
old
allen
and
she
is
absurd
about
her
you
know
she
is
not
very
well
lately
and
ellen
goes
to
see
her
i
know
every
day
regularly
and
there
are
the
gordons
and
carpenters
and
murrays
and
mackintoshes
she
sees
them
continually
but
i
do
think
she
takes
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
in
their
company
the
fact
is
she
is
too
sober
she
has
as
sweet
a
smile
as
i
ever
saw
said
lindsay
and
as
hearty
a
laugh
when
she
does
laugh
she
is
none
of
your
gigglers
but
when
she
does
laugh
said
lady
keith
it
is
not
when
other
people
do
i
think
she
is
generally
grave
when
there
is
most
merriment
around
her
i
love
to
hear
her
laugh
said
lindsay
it
is
in
such
a
low
sweet
tone
and
seems
to
come
so
from
the
very
spring
of
enjoyment
yet
i
must
say
i
think
catherine
is
half
right
with
half
an
advocate
said
lady
keith
i
shall
not
effect
much
lindsay
uttered
a
low
whistle
at
this
moment
the
door
opened
and
ellen
came
gravely
in
with
a
book
in
her
hand
come
here
ellen
said
lindsay
holding
out
his
hand
here
your
aunt
says
you
do
like
anybody
how
is
it
are
you
of
an
unsociable
disposition
ellen
smile
would
have
been
a
sufficient
apology
to
him
for
a
much
graver
fault
anybody
out
of
the
house
i
meant
said
lady
keith
speak
ellen
and
clear
yourself
said
lindsay
i
like
some
people
said
ellen
smiling
i
do
think
i
like
a
great
many
people
much
but
you
do
like
young
people
said
lady
keith
that
is
what
i
complain
of
and
it
unnatural
now
there
the
other
day
when
you
went
to
ride
with
miss
gordon
and
her
brother
and
miss
macpherson
and
her
brother
i
heard
you
say
you
were
not
sorry
to
get
home
now
where
will
you
find
pleasanter
young
people
why
do
you
like
them
ellen
said
lindsay
i
do
like
them
tolerably
what
does
mean
i
should
have
liked
my
ride
better
the
other
day
said
ellen
if
they
had
talked
about
sensible
things
nonsense
said
lady
keith
society
can
not
be
made
up
of
m
mullers
what
did
they
talk
about
ellen
said
lindsay
who
seemed
amused
about
partners
in
dancing
at
least
the
ladies
did
and
dresses
and
different
gentlemen
and
what
this
one
said
and
the
other
one
said
it
was
very
amusing
to
me
lindsay
laughed
and
the
gentlemen
ellen
how
did
you
like
them
i
did
like
them
particularly
sir
what
have
you
against
ellen
i
do
wish
to
say
anything
against
them
aunt
keith
come
come
speak
out
i
did
like
their
talking
sir
any
better
than
the
ladies
and
besides
that
i
do
think
they
were
very
polite
why
not
said
lindsay
highly
amused
i
do
think
it
was
very
polite
said
ellen
for
them
to
sit
still
on
their
horses
when
i
went
out
and
let
brocklesby
help
me
to
mount
they
took
me
up
at
muller
you
know
sir
muller
had
been
obliged
to
go
out
and
leave
me
lindsay
threw
a
glance
at
his
sister
which
she
rather
resented
and
pray
what
do
you
expect
ellen
said
she
you
are
a
mere
child
do
you
think
you
ought
to
be
treated
as
a
woman
i
do
wish
to
be
treated
as
anything
but
a
child
aunt
keith
but
ellen
remembered
well
one
day
at
home
when
john
had
been
before
the
door
on
horseback
and
she
had
run
out
to
give
him
a
message
his
instantly
dismounting
to
hear
it
and
i
was
more
a
child
then
she
thought
and
he
was
a
stranger
whom
you
like
ellen
inquired
lindsay
who
looked
extremely
satisfied
with
the
result
of
the
examination
i
like
muller
sir
nobody
else
mrs
allen
there
exclaimed
lady
keith
have
you
come
from
her
room
just
now
yes
sir
what
your
fancy
for
going
there
i
like
to
hear
her
talk
sir
and
to
read
to
her
it
gives
her
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
and
i
like
to
talk
to
her
what
do
you
talk
about
she
talks
to
me
about
my
mother
and
you
i
like
to
talk
to
her
about
old
times
said
ellen
changing
colour
profitable
conversation
said
lindsay
you
will
not
go
to
her
room
any
more
ellen
said
lindsay
in
great
dismay
at
what
allen
would
think
ellen
began
a
remonstrance
but
only
one
word
was
uttered
lindsay
hand
was
upon
her
lips
he
next
took
the
book
she
still
held
is
this
what
you
have
been
reading
to
her
ellen
bowed
in
answer
who
wrote
all
this
before
she
could
speak
he
had
turned
to
the
front
leaf
and
read
to
my
little
sister
he
quietly
put
the
book
in
his
pocket
and
ellen
as
quietly
left
the
room
i
am
glad
you
have
said
that
said
lady
keith
you
are
quick
enough
when
you
see
anything
for
yourself
but
you
never
will
believe
other
people
there
is
nothing
wrong
here
said
lindsay
only
i
will
not
have
her
going
back
to
those
old
recollections
she
is
so
fond
of
i
wish
i
could
make
her
drink
lethe
what
is
the
book
said
lindsay
i
hardly
know
said
he
turning
it
over
except
it
is
from
that
person
that
seems
to
have
obtained
such
an
ascendency
over
her
it
is
full
of
his
notes
it
is
a
religious
work
she
reads
a
great
deal
too
much
of
that
sort
of
thing
said
lindsay
i
wish
you
would
contrive
to
put
a
stop
to
it
you
can
do
it
better
than
any
one
else
she
is
very
fond
of
you
that
was
not
a
good
argument
lindsay
was
silent
his
thoughts
went
back
to
the
conversation
held
that
evening
in
ellen
room
and
to
certain
other
things
and
perhaps
he
was
thinking
that
if
religion
had
much
to
do
with
making
her
what
she
was
it
was
a
tree
that
bore
good
fruits
i
think
said
lady
keith
that
is
one
reason
why
she
takes
so
little
to
the
young
people
she
sees
i
have
seen
her
sit
perfectly
grave
when
they
were
all
laughing
and
talking
around
her
it
really
looks
singular
i
do
like
it
i
presume
she
would
have
thought
it
wicked
to
laugh
with
them
and
the
other
night
i
missed
her
from
the
younger
part
of
the
company
where
she
should
have
been
and
there
she
was
in
the
other
room
with
muller
and
somebody
else
gravely
listening
to
their
conversation
i
saw
her
said
lindsay
smiling
and
she
looked
anything
but
dull
or
sober
i
would
rather
have
her
gravity
after
all
catherine
than
anybody
else
merriment
i
know
i
wish
she
had
never
been
detained
in
america
after
the
time
when
she
should
have
come
to
us
said
lindsay
i
wish
the
woman
had
what
she
deserves
that
kept
back
the
letters
said
lindsay
yes
indeed
said
his
sister
and
i
have
been
in
continual
fear
of
a
visit
from
that
very
person
that
you
say
gave
ellen
the
book
he
is
here
said
lindsay
i
do
know
where
he
is
but
he
on
this
side
of
the
water
at
the
time
ellen
came
on
so
she
told
me
i
wish
he
was
in
egypt
i
do
intend
he
shall
see
her
if
he
comes
said
lady
keith
if
i
can
possibly
prevent
it
i
gave
porterfield
orders
if
any
one
asked
for
her
to
tell
me
immediately
and
not
her
upon
any
account
but
nobody
has
come
hitherto
and
i
am
in
hopes
none
will
lindsay
rose
and
walked
up
and
down
the
room
with
folded
arms
in
a
very
thoughtful
style
ellen
with
some
difficulty
bore
herself
as
usual
throughout
the
next
day
and
evening
though
constantly
on
the
rack
to
get
possession
of
her
book
again
it
was
not
spoken
of
nor
hinted
at
when
another
morning
came
she
could
stand
it
no
longer
she
went
soon
after
breakfast
into
lindsay
study
where
he
was
writing
ellen
came
behind
him
and
laying
both
her
arms
over
his
shoulders
said
in
his
ear
will
you
let
me
have
my
book
again
father
a
kiss
was
her
only
answer
ellen
waited
go
to
the
said
lindsay
presently
or
to
the
and
choose
out
anything
you
like
ellen
instead
i
would
exchange
it
for
all
that
is
in
them
she
answered
with
some
warmth
and
with
the
husky
feeling
coming
in
her
throat
lindsay
said
nothing
at
any
rate
whispered
ellen
after
a
minute
you
will
not
destroy
it
or
do
anything
to
it
you
will
take
care
of
it
and
let
me
have
it
again
wo
you
sir
i
will
try
to
take
care
of
you
my
daughter
again
ellen
paused
and
then
came
round
in
front
of
him
to
plead
to
more
purpose
i
will
do
anything
in
the
world
for
you
sir
she
said
earnestly
if
you
will
give
me
my
book
again
you
must
do
anything
in
the
world
for
me
said
he
smiling
and
pinching
her
cheek
without
that
but
it
is
mine
ellen
ventured
to
urge
though
trembling
come
come
said
lindsay
his
tone
changing
and
you
are
mine
you
must
understand
ellen
stood
silent
struggling
between
the
alternate
surgings
of
passion
and
checks
of
prudence
and
conscience
but
at
last
the
wave
rolled
too
high
and
broke
clasping
her
hands
to
her
face
she
exclaimed
not
indeed
violently
but
with
sufficient
energy
of
expression
oh
not
right
it
not
right
go
to
your
room
and
consider
of
that
said
lindsay
i
do
not
wish
to
see
you
again
ellen
ellen
was
wretched
not
for
grief
at
her
loss
merely
that
she
could
have
borne
that
had
not
even
the
greatest
share
in
her
distress
she
was
at
war
with
herself
her
mind
was
in
a
perfect
turmoil
she
had
been
a
passionate
child
in
earlier
days
under
religion
happy
reign
that
had
long
ceased
to
be
true
of
her
it
was
only
very
rarely
that
she
or
those
around
her
were
led
to
remember
or
suspect
that
it
had
once
been
the
case
she
was
surprised
and
at
herself
now
to
find
the
strength
of
the
old
temper
suddenly
roused
she
was
utterly
and
exceedingly
out
of
humour
with
lindsay
and
consequently
with
everybody
and
everything
else
consequently
conscience
would
not
give
her
a
moment
peace
consequently
that
day
was
a
long
and
bitter
fight
betwixt
right
and
wrong
duties
were
neglected
because
she
could
not
give
her
mind
to
them
then
they
crowded
upon
her
notice
at
undue
times
all
was
miserable
confusion
in
vain
she
would
try
to
reason
and
school
herself
into
right
feeling
at
one
thought
of
her
lost
treasure
passion
would
come
flooding
up
and
drown
all
her
reasonings
and
endeavours
she
grew
absolutely
weary
but
the
day
passed
and
the
night
came
and
she
went
to
bed
without
being
able
to
make
up
her
mind
and
she
arose
in
the
morning
to
renew
the
battle
how
long
is
this
miserable
condition
to
last
she
said
to
herself
you
can
entirely
give
up
your
feeling
of
resentment
and
apologise
to
lindsay
said
conscience
apologise
but
i
done
wrong
yes
you
have
said
conscience
you
spoke
improperly
he
is
justly
displeased
and
you
must
make
an
apology
before
there
can
be
any
peace
but
i
said
the
truth
it
is
right
it
is
not
right
it
is
wrong
and
am
i
to
go
and
make
an
apology
i
ca
do
it
yes
for
the
wrong
you
have
done
said
conscience
that
is
all
your
concern
and
he
has
a
right
to
do
what
he
pleases
with
you
and
yours
and
he
may
have
his
own
reasons
for
what
he
has
done
and
he
loves
you
very
much
and
you
ought
not
to
let
him
remain
displeased
with
you
one
moment
longer
than
you
can
help
he
is
in
the
place
of
a
father
to
you
and
you
owe
him
a
child
duty
but
pride
and
passion
still
fought
against
reason
and
conscience
and
ellen
was
miserable
the
rang
there
i
shall
have
to
go
down
to
breakfast
directly
and
they
will
see
how
i
look
they
will
see
i
am
angry
and
well
i
to
be
angry
but
what
will
they
think
then
of
my
religion
is
my
rushlight
burning
bright
am
i
honouring
christ
now
is
the
way
to
make
his
name
and
his
truth
lovely
in
their
eyes
oh
shame
shame
i
have
enough
to
humble
myself
for
and
all
yesterday
at
any
rate
they
know
i
was
angry
ellen
threw
herself
upon
her
knees
and
when
she
rose
up
the
spirit
of
pride
was
entirely
broken
and
resentment
had
died
with
the
rang
before
she
was
quite
ready
she
was
afraid
she
could
not
see
lindsay
until
he
should
be
at
the
table
but
it
shall
make
no
difference
she
said
to
herself
they
know
i
have
offended
him
it
is
right
they
should
hear
what
i
have
to
say
they
were
all
at
the
table
but
it
made
no
difference
ellen
went
straight
to
lindsay
and
laying
one
hand
timidly
in
his
and
the
other
on
his
shoulder
she
at
once
humbly
and
frankly
confessed
that
she
had
spoken
as
she
ought
not
the
day
before
and
that
she
was
very
sorry
she
had
displeased
him
and
begged
his
forgiveness
it
was
instantly
granted
you
are
a
good
child
ellen
said
lindsay
as
he
fondly
embraced
her
oh
no
sir
do
call
me
so
i
am
everything
in
the
world
but
that
then
all
the
rest
of
the
world
are
good
children
why
did
you
come
to
me
before
because
i
could
sir
i
felt
wrong
all
day
yesterday
lindsay
laughed
and
kissed
her
and
bade
her
sit
down
and
eat
her
breakfast
it
was
about
a
month
after
this
that
he
made
her
a
present
of
a
beautiful
little
watch
ellen
first
look
was
of
great
delight
the
second
was
one
of
curious
doubtful
expression
directed
to
his
face
half
tendering
the
watch
back
to
him
as
she
saw
that
he
understood
her
why
said
he
smiling
do
you
mean
to
say
you
would
rather
have
that
than
this
a
great
deal
no
said
he
hanging
the
watch
round
her
neck
you
shall
not
have
it
but
you
may
make
your
mind
easy
for
i
have
it
safe
and
it
shall
come
back
to
you
again
some
time
or
other
with
this
promise
ellen
was
obliged
to
be
satisfied
the
summer
passed
in
the
enjoyment
of
all
that
wealth
of
purse
and
of
affection
both
could
bestow
upon
their
darling
early
in
the
season
the
family
returned
to
the
braes
ellen
liked
it
there
much
better
than
in
the
city
there
was
more
that
reminded
her
of
old
times
the
sky
and
the
land
though
different
from
those
she
best
loved
were
yet
but
another
expression
of
nature
face
it
was
the
same
face
still
and
on
many
a
sunbeam
ellen
travelled
across
the
atlantic
she
was
sorry
to
lose
muller
but
she
could
not
have
kept
him
in
edinburgh
he
quitted
scotland
about
that
time
footnote
then
by
a
sunbeam
i
will
climb
to
thee
george
herbert
other
masters
attended
her
in
the
country
or
she
went
to
edinburgh
to
attend
them
lindsay
liked
that
very
well
he
was
often
there
himself
and
after
her
lesson
he
loved
to
have
her
with
him
in
the
library
and
at
dinner
and
during
the
drive
home
ellen
liked
it
because
it
was
so
pleasant
to
him
and
besides
there
was
a
variety
about
it
and
the
drives
were
always
her
delight
and
she
chose
his
company
at
any
time
rather
than
that
of
her
aunt
and
grandmother
so
many
a
happy
day
that
summer
had
she
and
lindsay
together
and
many
an
odd
pleasure
in
the
course
of
them
did
he
find
or
make
for
her
sometimes
it
was
a
new
book
sometimes
a
new
sight
sometimes
a
new
trinket
according
to
his
promise
he
had
purchased
her
a
fine
horse
and
almost
daily
ellen
was
upon
his
back
and
with
lindsay
in
the
course
of
the
summer
scoured
the
country
far
and
near
every
scene
of
any
historic
interest
within
a
good
distance
of
the
braes
was
visited
and
some
of
them
again
and
again
pleasures
of
all
kinds
were
at
ellen
disposal
and
to
her
father
and
grandmother
she
was
truly
the
light
of
their
eyes
and
ellen
was
happy
but
it
was
not
all
these
things
nor
even
her
affection
for
lindsay
that
made
her
so
he
saw
her
calm
and
sunshiny
face
and
busy
happy
demeanour
and
fancied
though
he
sometimes
had
doubts
about
it
that
she
did
not
trouble
herself
much
with
old
recollections
or
would
in
time
get
over
them
it
was
so
ellen
never
forgot
and
sometimes
when
she
seemed
busiest
and
happiest
it
was
the
thought
of
an
absent
and
distant
friend
that
was
nerving
her
energies
and
giving
colour
to
her
cheeks
still
as
at
first
it
was
in
her
hour
alone
that
ellen
laid
down
care
and
took
up
submission
it
was
that
calmed
her
brow
and
brightened
her
smile
and
though
now
and
then
she
shed
bitter
tears
and
repeated
her
despairing
exclamation
well
i
will
see
him
in
heaven
in
general
she
lived
on
hope
and
kept
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
some
of
her
old
feeling
of
confidence
perhaps
her
brow
grew
somewhat
meeker
and
her
smile
less
bright
as
the
year
rolled
on
months
flew
by
and
brought
her
no
letters
ellen
marvelled
and
sorrowed
in
vain
one
day
mourning
over
it
to
allen
the
good
housekeeper
asked
her
if
her
friends
knew
her
address
ellen
at
first
said
to
be
sure
but
after
a
few
minutes
reflection
was
obliged
to
confess
that
she
was
not
certain
about
it
it
would
have
been
just
like
humphreys
to
lose
sight
entirely
of
such
a
matter
and
very
natural
for
her
in
her
grief
and
confusion
of
mind
and
inexperience
to
be
equally
forgetful
she
wrote
immediately
to
humphreys
and
supplied
the
defect
and
hope
brightened
again
once
before
she
had
written
on
the
occasion
of
the
refunding
her
expenses
lindsay
and
his
mother
were
very
prompt
to
do
this
though
ellen
could
not
tell
what
the
exact
amount
might
be
they
took
care
to
be
on
the
safe
side
and
sent
more
than
enough
ellen
mind
had
changed
since
she
came
to
scotland
she
was
sorry
to
have
the
money
go
she
understood
the
feeling
with
which
it
was
sent
and
it
hurt
her
two
or
three
months
after
the
date
of
her
last
letter
she
received
at
length
one
from
humphreys
a
long
very
kind
and
very
wise
one
she
lived
upon
it
for
a
good
while
lindsay
bills
were
returned
humphreys
declined
utterly
to
accept
them
telling
ellen
that
he
looked
upon
her
as
his
own
child
up
to
the
time
that
her
friends
took
her
out
of
his
hands
and
that
he
owed
her
more
than
she
owed
him
ellen
gave
the
money
she
dared
not
give
the
whole
message
to
lindsay
the
bills
were
instantly
and
haughtily
and
sent
back
to
america
still
nothing
was
heard
from
john
ellen
wondered
waited
wept
sadly
quieted
herself
into
submission
and
as
time
went
on
clung
faster
and
faster
to
her
bible
and
the
refuge
she
found
there
chapter
lii
why
did
you
show
him
up
blockhead
show
him
up
sir
with
all
my
heart
sir
up
or
down
all
one
to
me
man
one
evening
it
was
new
year
eve
a
large
party
was
expected
at
lindsay
ellen
was
not
of
an
age
to
go
abroad
to
parties
but
at
home
her
father
and
grandmother
never
could
bear
to
do
without
her
when
they
had
company
generally
ellen
liked
it
very
much
not
called
upon
to
take
any
active
part
herself
she
had
leisure
to
observe
and
enjoy
in
quiet
and
often
heard
music
and
often
by
lindsay
side
listened
to
conversation
in
which
she
took
great
pleasure
however
it
happened
that
ellen
thoughts
were
running
on
other
things
and
lindsay
woman
who
had
come
in
to
dress
her
was
not
at
all
satisfied
with
her
grave
looks
and
the
little
concern
she
seemed
to
take
in
what
was
going
on
i
wish
miss
ellen
you
please
hold
your
head
up
and
look
somewhere
i
do
know
when
i
get
your
hair
done
if
you
keep
it
down
so
oh
mason
i
think
that
do
it
looks
very
well
you
need
do
anything
more
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
ellen
but
you
know
it
your
grandmother
that
must
be
satisfied
and
she
will
have
it
just
so
there
now
that
going
to
look
lovely
but
indeed
miss
ellen
she
wo
be
pleased
if
you
carry
such
a
soberish
face
downstairs
and
what
will
the
master
say
most
young
ladies
would
be
as
bright
as
a
bee
at
being
going
to
see
so
many
people
and
indeed
it
what
you
should
i
had
rather
see
one
or
two
persons
than
one
or
two
hundred
said
ellen
speaking
half
to
herself
and
half
to
mason
well
for
pity
sake
miss
ellen
dear
if
you
can
do
look
as
if
it
was
a
funeral
it
was
there
much
trouble
to
fix
you
anyhow
if
you
only
care
a
little
more
about
it
it
would
be
a
blessing
stop
till
i
fix
this
lace
the
master
will
call
you
his
white
sure
enough
that
nothing
new
said
ellen
half
smiling
mason
left
her
and
feeling
the
want
of
something
to
raise
her
spirits
ellen
sorrowfully
went
to
her
bible
and
slowly
turning
it
over
looked
along
its
pages
to
catch
a
sight
of
something
cheering
before
she
went
downstairs
god
is
our
god
for
ever
and
ever
he
will
be
our
guide
even
unto
is
that
enough
thought
ellen
as
her
eyes
filled
in
answer
it
ought
to
be
john
would
say
it
was
oh
where
is
he
she
went
on
turning
leaf
after
leaf
lord
of
hosts
blessed

the
man
that
trusteth
in
thee
that
is
true
surely
she
thought
and
i
do
trust
in
him
i
am
blessed
i
am
happy
come
what
may
he
will
let
nothing
come
to
those
that
trust
in
him
but
what
is
good
for
them
if
he
is
my
god
i
have
enough
to
make
me
happy
i
ought
to
be
happy
i
will
be
happy
i
will
trust
him
and
take
what
he
gives
me
and
try
to
leave
as
john
used
to
tell
me
my
affairs
in
his
hand
for
a
minute
tears
flowed
then
they
were
wiped
away
and
the
smile
she
gave
lindsay
when
she
met
him
in
the
hall
was
not
less
bright
than
usual
the
company
were
gathered
but
it
was
still
early
in
the
evening
when
a
gentleman
came
who
declined
to
enter
the
and
asked
for
miss
lindsay
miss
lindsay
is
engaged
an
what
for
suld
ye
say
sae
mr
porterfield
cried
the
voice
of
the
housekeeper
who
was
passing
in
the
hall
when
ye
ken
as
weel
as
i
do
that
miss
ellen
the
butler
stopped
her
with
saying
something
about
my
lady
and
repeated
his
answer
to
the
gentleman
the
latter
wrote
a
word
or
two
on
a
card
which
he
drew
from
his
pocket
and
desired
him
to
carry
it
to
miss
ellen
he
carried
it
to
lady
keith
what
sort
of
a
person
porterfield
said
lady
keith
crumpling
the
paper
in
her
fingers
and
withdrawing
a
little
from
the
company
uncommon
fine
gentleman
my
lady
porterfield
answered
in
a
low
tone
a
gentleman
said
lady
keith
inquiringly
certain
my
lady
and
as
up
and
down
spoken
as
if
he
was
a
prince
of
the
blood
he
somebody
that
is
not
accustomed
to
be
said
to
for
sure
lady
keith
hesitated
recollecting
however
that
she
had
just
left
ellen
safe
in
the
she
made
up
her
mind
and
desired
porterfield
to
show
the
stranger
in
as
he
entered
unannounced
her
eyes
unwillingly
verified
the
butler
judgment
and
to
the
inquiry
whether
he
might
see
miss
lindsay
she
answered
very
politely
though
with
regrets
that
miss
lindsay
was
engaged
may
i
be
pardoned
for
asking
said
the
stranger
with
the
slightest
possible
approach
to
a
smile
whether
that
decision
is
imperative
i
leave
scotland
my
reasons
for
wishing
to
see
miss
lindsay
this
evening
are
urgent
lady
keith
could
hardly
believe
her
ears
or
command
her
countenance
to
keep
company
with
her
expressions
of
sorrow
that
it
was
impossible
miss
lindsay
could
not
have
the
pleasure
that
evening
may
i
beg
then
to
know
at
what
hour
i
may
hope
to
see
her
hastily
resolving
that
ellen
should
on
the
morrow
accept
a
invitation
lady
keith
answered
that
she
would
not
be
in
town
she
would
leave
edinburgh
at
an
early
hour
the
stranger
bowed
and
withdrew
that
was
all
the
bystanders
saw
but
lady
keith
who
had
winced
under
an
eye
that
she
could
not
help
fancying
read
her
too
well
saw
that
in
his
parting
look
which
made
her
uneasy
beckoning
a
servant
who
stood
near
she
ordered
him
to
wait
upon
that
gentleman
to
the
door
the
man
obeyed
but
the
stranger
did
not
take
his
cloak
and
made
no
motion
to
go
no
sir
not
that
way
he
said
sternly
as
the
servant
laid
his
hand
on
the
lock
show
me
to
miss
lindsay
miss
ellen
said
the
man
doubtfully
coming
back
and
thinking
from
the
gentleman
manner
that
he
must
have
misunderstood
lady
keith
where
is
miss
ellen
arthur
the
person
addressed
threw
his
head
back
towards
the
door
he
had
just
come
from
on
the
other
side
of
the
hall
this
way
sir
if
you
please
what
name
sir
no
name
stand
back
said
the
stranger
as
he
entered
there
were
a
number
of
people
gathered
round
a
lady
who
was
at
the
piano
singing
ellen
was
there
in
the
midst
of
them
the
gentleman
advanced
quietly
to
the
edge
of
the
group
and
stood
there
without
being
noticed
ellen
eyes
were
bent
on
the
floor
the
expression
of
her
face
touched
and
pleased
him
greatly
it
was
precisely
what
he
wished
to
see
without
having
the
least
shadow
of
sorrow
upon
it
there
was
in
all
its
lines
that
singular
mixture
of
gravity
and
sweetness
that
is
never
seen
but
where
religion
and
discipline
have
done
their
work
well
the
writing
of
the
wisdom
that
looks
soberly
and
the
love
that
looks
kindly
on
all
things
he
was
not
sure
at
first
whether
she
were
intently
listening
to
the
music
or
whether
her
mind
was
upon
something
far
different
and
far
away
he
thought
the
latter
he
was
right
ellen
at
the
moment
had
escaped
from
the
company
and
the
noisy
sounds
of
the
performer
at
her
side
and
while
her
eye
was
curiously
tracing
out
the
pattern
of
the
carpet
her
mind
was
resting
itself
in
one
of
the
verses
she
had
been
reading
that
same
evening
suddenly
and
as
it
seemed
from
no
connection
with
anything
in
or
out
of
her
thoughts
there
came
to
her
mind
the
image
of
john
as
she
had
first
seen
him
that
first
evening
she
ever
saw
him
at
when
she
looked
up
from
the
boiling
chocolate
and
espied
him
standing
in
an
attitude
of
waiting
near
the
door
ellen
at
first
wondered
how
that
thought
should
have
come
into
her
head
just
then
the
next
moment
from
a
sudden
impulse
she
raised
her
eyes
to
search
for
the
cause
and
saw
john
smile
it
would
not
be
easy
to
describe
the
change
in
ellen
face
lightning
makes
as
quick
and
as
brilliant
an
illumination
but
lightning
does
not
stay
with
a
spring
she
reached
him
and
seizing
both
his
hands
drew
him
out
of
the
door
near
which
they
were
standing
and
as
soon
as
they
were
hidden
from
view
threw
herself
into
his
arms
in
an
agony
of
joy
before
however
either
of
them
could
say
a
word
she
had
caught
his
hand
again
and
led
him
back
along
the
hall
to
the
private
staircase
she
mounted
it
rapidly
to
and
there
again
she
threw
herself
into
his
arms
exclaiming
oh
john
my
dear
john
my
dear
brother
but
neither
smiles
nor
words
would
do
for
the
overcharged
heart
the
tide
of
joy
ran
too
strong
and
too
much
swelled
from
the
open
sources
of
love
and
memory
to
keep
any
bounds
and
it
kept
none
ellen
sat
down
and
bowing
her
head
on
the
arm
of
the
sofa
wept
with
all
the
vehement
passion
of
her
childhood
quivering
from
head
to
foot
with
convulsive
sobs
john
might
guess
from
the
outpouring
how
much
her
heart
had
been
secretly
gathering
for
months
past
for
a
little
while
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
but
this
excessive
agitation
he
was
not
willing
should
continue
he
said
nothing
sitting
down
beside
ellen
on
the
sofa
he
quietly
possessed
himself
of
one
of
her
hands
and
when
in
her
excitement
the
hand
struggled
to
get
away
again
it
was
not
permitted
ellen
understood
that
very
well
and
immediately
checked
herself
better
than
words
the
calm
firm
grasp
of
his
hand
quieted
her
her
sobbing
stilled
she
turned
from
the
arm
of
the
sofa
and
leaning
her
head
upon
him
took
his
hand
in
both
hers
and
pressed
it
to
her
lips
as
if
she
were
half
beside
herself
but
that
was
not
permitted
to
last
either
for
his
hand
quickly
imprisoned
hers
again
there
was
silence
still
ellen
could
not
look
up
yet
and
neither
seemed
very
forward
to
speak
she
sat
gradually
quieting
down
into
fulness
of
happiness
i
thought
you
never
would
come
john
at
length
ellen
half
whispered
half
said
and
i
can
not
stay
now
i
must
leave
you
ellie
ellen
started
up
and
looked
up
now
leave
me
for
how
long
where
are
you
going
home
to
america
ellen
heart
died
within
her
was
the
end
of
all
her
hopes
did
her
confidence
end
she
shed
no
tears
now
he
could
see
that
she
grew
absolutely
still
from
intense
feeling
what
the
matter
ellie
said
the
low
gentle
tones
she
so
well
remembered
i
am
leaving
you
but
for
a
time
i
go
home
now
but
if
i
live
you
will
see
me
again
oh
i
wish
i
was
going
with
you
ellen
exclaimed
bursting
into
tears
my
dear
ellie
said
her
brother
in
an
altered
voice
drawing
her
again
to
his
arms
you
can
not
wish
it
more
than
i
i
never
thought
you
would
leave
me
here
john
neither
would
i
if
i
could
help
it
neither
will
i
a
minute
longer
than
i
can
help
but
we
must
both
wait
my
own
ellie
do
not
cry
so
for
my
sake
wait
till
when
said
ellen
not
a
little
reassured
i
have
no
power
now
to
remove
you
from
your
legal
guardians
and
you
have
no
right
to
choose
for
yourself
and
when
shall
i
in
a
few
years
a
few
years
but
in
the
meantime
john
what
shall
i
do
without
you
if
i
could
see
you
once
in
a
while
but
there
is
no
one
here
not
a
single
one
to
help
me
to
keep
right
no
one
talks
to
me
as
you
used
to
and
i
am
all
the
while
afraid
i
shall
go
wrong
in
something
what
shall
i
do
what
the
weak
must
always
do
ellie
seek
for
strength
where
it
may
be
had
and
so
i
do
john
said
ellen
weeping
but
i
want
you
oh
how
much
are
you
not
happy
here
yes
i
am
happy
at
least
i
thought
i
was
ago
as
happy
as
i
can
be
i
have
everything
to
make
me
happy
except
what
would
do
it
we
must
both
have
recourse
to
our
old
remedy
against
sorrow
and
loneliness
you
have
not
forgotten
the
use
of
it
ellie
no
john
said
ellen
meeting
his
eyes
with
a
tearful
smile
they
love
you
here
do
they
not
very
much
too
much
and
you
love
them
yes
that
a
doubtful
i
do
love
my
father
very
much
and
my
grandmother
too
though
not
so
much
i
can
not
help
loving
them
they
love
me
so
but
they
are
so
unlike
you
that
is
not
much
to
the
purpose
after
all
said
john
smiling
there
are
varieties
of
excellence
in
the
world
oh
yes
but
that
is
what
i
mean
it
is
a
variety
of
excellence
they
make
me
do
everything
they
have
a
mind
i
do
mean
she
added
smiling
that
is
not
like
you
but
you
always
had
a
reason
they
are
different
my
father
makes
me
drink
wine
every
now
and
then
i
like
to
do
it
and
he
knows
i
do
not
and
i
think
that
is
the
reason
i
have
to
do
it
that
is
not
a
matter
of
great
importance
ellie
provided
they
do
not
make
you
do
something
wrong
they
could
not
do
that
i
hope
and
there
is
another
thing
they
can
not
make
me
do
what
is
that
stay
here
when
you
will
take
me
away
there
was
a
few
minutes
thoughtful
pause
on
both
sides
you
are
grown
ellie
said
john
you
are
not
the
child
i
left
you
i
do
know
said
ellen
smiling
it
seems
to
me
i
am
just
the
same
let
me
see
look
at
me
she
raised
her
face
and
amidst
smiles
and
tears
its
look
was
not
less
clear
and
frank
than
his
was
penetrating
just
the
same
was
the
verdict
of
her
brother
eyes
a
moment
afterwards
ellen
smile
grew
bright
as
she
read
it
there
why
have
you
never
come
or
written
before
john
i
did
not
know
where
you
were
i
have
not
been
in
england
for
many
months
until
quite
lately
and
i
could
not
get
your
address
i
think
my
father
was
without
it
for
a
long
time
and
when
at
last
he
sent
it
to
me
the
letter
miscarried
never
reached
me
there
were
delays
upon
delays
and
when
did
you
get
it
i
preferred
coming
to
writing
and
now
you
must
go
home
so
soon
i
must
ellie
my
business
has
lingered
on
a
great
while
and
it
is
quite
time
i
should
return
i
expect
to
sail
next
week
gillespie
is
going
with
me
her
husband
stays
behind
till
spring
ellen
sighed
i
made
a
friend
of
a
friend
of
yours
whom
i
met
in
switzerland
last
summer
m
muller
muller
did
you
oh
i
am
very
glad
i
am
very
glad
you
know
him
he
is
the
best
friend
i
have
got
here
after
my
father
i
do
know
what
i
should
have
done
without
him
i
have
heard
him
talk
of
you
said
john
smiling
he
has
just
come
back
he
was
to
be
here
this
evening
there
was
a
pause
again
it
does
not
seem
right
to
go
home
without
you
ellie
said
her
brother
then
i
think
you
belong
to
me
more
than
to
anybody
that
is
exactly
what
i
think
said
ellen
with
one
of
her
bright
looks
and
then
bursting
into
tears
i
am
very
glad
you
think
so
too
i
will
always
do
whatever
you
tell
me
just
as
i
used
to
no
matter
what
anybody
else
says
perhaps
i
shall
try
you
in
two
or
three
things
ellie
will
you
in
what
oh
it
would
make
me
so
happy
so
much
happier
if
i
could
be
doing
something
to
please
you
i
wish
i
was
at
home
with
you
again
i
will
bring
that
about
ellie
if
you
make
your
words
good
i
shall
be
happy
then
said
ellen
her
old
confidence
standing
stronger
than
ever
because
i
know
you
will
if
you
say
so
though
how
you
will
manage
it
i
can
not
conceive
my
father
and
grandmother
and
aunt
can
not
bear
to
hear
me
speak
of
america
i
believe
they
would
be
glad
if
there
was
such
a
place
in
the
world
they
would
not
even
let
me
think
of
it
if
they
could
help
it
i
never
dare
mention
your
name
or
say
a
word
about
old
times
they
are
afraid
of
my
loving
anybody
i
believe
they
want
to
have
me
all
to
themselves
what
will
they
say
to
you
then
ellie
if
you
leave
them
to
give
yourself
to
me
i
can
not
help
it
replied
ellen
they
must
say
what
they
please
and
with
abundance
of
energy
and
not
a
few
tears
she
went
on
i
love
them
but
i
had
given
myself
to
you
a
great
while
ago
long
before
i
was
his
daughter
you
called
me
your
little
sister
i
ca
undo
that
john
and
i
do
want
to
it
does
make
a
bit
of
difference
that
we
were
not
born
so
john
suddenly
rose
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
ellen
soon
came
to
his
side
and
leaning
upon
his
arm
as
she
had
been
used
to
do
in
past
times
walked
up
and
down
with
him
at
first
silently
what
is
it
you
wanted
me
to
do
john
she
said
gently
at
length
you
said
or
three
things
one
is
that
you
keep
up
a
regular
and
full
correspondence
with
me
i
am
very
glad
that
you
will
let
me
do
that
said
ellen
that
is
exactly
what
i
should
like
but
what
i
am
afraid
they
will
not
let
me
i
will
arrange
that
very
well
said
ellen
joyously
then
it
will
do
oh
it
will
make
me
so
happy
and
you
will
write
to
me
certainly
and
i
will
tell
you
everything
about
myself
and
you
will
tell
me
how
i
ought
to
do
in
all
sorts
of
things
that
will
be
next
best
to
being
with
you
and
then
you
will
keep
me
right
i
wo
promise
you
that
ellie
said
john
smiling
you
must
learn
to
keep
yourself
right
i
know
you
will
though
however
you
may
smile
what
next
read
no
novels
i
never
do
john
i
knew
you
did
not
like
it
and
i
have
taken
good
care
to
keep
out
of
the
way
of
them
if
i
had
told
anybody
why
though
they
would
have
made
me
read
a
dozen
why
ellie
said
her
brother
you
must
need
some
care
to
keep
a
straight
line
where
your
course
lies
now
indeed
i
do
john
said
ellen
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
oh
now
i
have
felt
that
sometimes
and
then
how
i
wanted
you
her
hand
was
fondly
taken
in
his
as
many
a
time
it
had
been
taken
of
old
and
for
a
long
time
they
paced
up
and
down
the
conversation
running
sometimes
in
the
strain
that
both
loved
and
ellen
now
never
heard
sometimes
on
other
matters
such
a
conversation
as
those
she
had
lived
upon
in
former
days
and
now
drank
in
with
a
delight
and
eagerness
inexpressible
lindsay
would
have
been
in
dismay
to
have
seen
her
uplifted
face
which
though
tears
were
many
a
time
there
was
sparkling
and
glowing
with
life
and
joy
in
a
manner
he
had
never
known
it
she
almost
forgot
what
the
morrow
would
bring
in
the
exquisite
pleasure
of
the
instant
and
hung
upon
every
word
and
look
of
her
brother
as
if
her
life
were
there
and
in
a
few
weeks
said
ellen
at
length
you
will
be
in
our
own
dear
again
and
riding
on
the
black
prince
and
i
shall
be
here
and
it
will
be
it
will
be
empty
without
you
ellie
but
we
have
a
friend
that
is
sufficient
let
us
love
him
and
be
patient
it
is
very
hard
to
be
patient
murmured
ellen
but
dear
john
there
was
something
else
you
wanted
me
to
do
what
is
it
you
said
or
three
things
i
will
leave
that
to
another
time
but
why
i
will
do
it
whatever
it
be
pray
tell
me
no
said
he
smiling
not
now
you
shall
know
the
time
is
not
yet
have
you
heard
of
your
old
friend
van
brunt
no
what
of
him
he
has
come
out
before
the
world
as
a
christian
man
has
he
john
took
a
letter
from
his
pocket
and
opened
it
you
may
see
what
my
father
says
of
him
and
what
he
says
of
you
too
ellie
he
has
missed
you
much
oh
i
was
afraid
he
would
said
ellen
i
was
sure
he
did
she
took
the
letter
but
she
could
not
see
the
words
john
told
her
she
might
keep
it
to
read
at
her
leisure
and
how
are
they
all
at
ventnor
and
how
is
vawse
and
margery
all
well
vawse
spends
about
half
her
time
at
my
father
i
am
very
glad
of
that
marshman
wrote
me
to
bring
you
back
with
me
if
i
could
and
said
she
had
a
home
for
you
always
at
ventnor
how
kind
she
is
said
ellen
how
many
friends
i
find
everywhere
it
seems
to
me
john
that
almost
everybody
loves
me
that
a
singular
circumstance
however
i
am
no
exception
to
the
rule
ellie
oh
i
know
that
said
ellen
laughing
and
mr
george
george
is
well
how
much
i
love
him
said
ellen
how
much
i
would
give
to
see
him
i
wish
you
could
tell
me
about
poor
captain
and
the
brownie
but
i
suppose
you
have
heard
of
them
oh
when
i
think
of
it
all
at
home
how
i
want
to
be
there
oh
john
sometimes
lately
i
have
almost
thought
i
should
only
see
you
again
in
heaven
my
dear
ellie
i
shall
see
you
there
i
trust
but
if
we
live
we
shall
spend
our
lives
here
together
first
and
while
we
are
parted
we
will
keep
as
near
as
possible
by
praying
for
and
writing
to
each
other
and
what
god
orders
let
us
quietly
submit
to
ellen
had
much
ado
to
command
herself
at
the
tone
of
these
words
and
john
manner
as
he
clasped
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
brow
and
lips
she
strove
to
keep
back
a
show
of
feeling
that
would
distress
and
might
displease
him
but
the
next
moment
her
fluttering
spirits
were
stilled
by
hearing
the
few
soft
words
of
a
prayer
that
he
breathed
over
her
head
it
was
a
prayer
for
her
and
for
himself
and
one
of
its
petitions
was
that
they
might
be
kept
to
see
each
other
again
ellen
wrote
the
words
on
her
heart
are
you
going
he
showed
his
watch
well
i
shall
see
you
shall
you
be
here
certainly
where
else
should
i
be
what
time
must
you
set
out
i
need
not
till
afternoon
but
how
early
can
i
see
you
as
early
as
you
please
oh
spend
all
the
time
with
me
you
can
john
so
it
was
arranged
and
now
ellie
you
must
go
downstairs
and
present
me
to
mr
lindsay
to
my
father
for
a
moment
ellen
face
was
a
compound
of
expressions
she
instantly
acquiesced
however
and
went
down
with
her
brother
her
heart
it
must
be
confessed
going
very
indeed
she
took
him
into
the
library
which
was
not
this
evening
thrown
open
to
company
and
sent
a
servant
for
lindsay
while
waiting
for
his
coming
ellen
felt
as
if
she
had
not
the
fair
use
of
her
senses
was
that
john
humphreys
quietly
walking
up
and
down
the
library
mr
lindsay
library
and
was
she
about
to
introduce
her
brother
to
the
person
who
had
forbidden
her
to
mention
his
name
there
was
something
however
in
john
figure
and
air
in
his
utter
coolness
that
insensibly
restated
her
spirits
triumphant
confidence
in
him
overcame
the
fear
of
lindsay
and
when
he
appeared
ellen
with
tolerable
composure
met
him
her
hand
upon
john
arm
and
said
father
this
is
humphreys
she
dared
not
add
i
hope
lindsay
will
pardon
my
giving
him
this
trouble
said
the
latter
we
have
one
thing
in
common
which
should
forbid
our
being
strangers
to
each
other
i
at
least
was
unwilling
to
leave
scotland
without
making
myself
known
to
mr
lindsay
lindsay
most
devoutly
wished
the
thing
in
common
had
been
anything
else
he
bowed
and
was
happy
to
have
the
pleasure
but
evidently
neither
pleased
nor
happy
ellen
could
see
that
may
i
take
up
five
minutes
of
lindsay
time
to
explain
perhaps
to
apologise
said
john
slightly
smiling
for
what
i
have
said
a
little
ashamed
it
might
be
to
have
his
feeling
suspected
lindsay
instantly
granted
the
request
and
politely
invited
his
unwelcome
guest
to
be
seated
obeying
a
glance
from
her
brother
which
she
understood
ellen
withdrew
to
the
further
side
of
the
room
where
she
could
not
hear
what
they
said
john
took
up
the
history
of
acquaintance
with
his
family
and
briefly
gave
it
to
lindsay
scarce
touching
on
the
benefits
by
them
conferred
on
her
and
skilfully
dwelling
rather
on
ellen
herself
and
setting
forth
what
she
had
been
to
them
lindsay
could
not
be
unconscious
of
what
his
visitor
delicately
omitted
to
hint
at
neither
could
he
help
making
secretly
to
himself
some
most
unwilling
admissions
and
though
he
might
wish
the
speaker
at
the
antipodes
and
doubtless
did
yet
the
sketch
was
too
happily
given
and
his
fondness
for
ellen
too
great
for
him
not
to
be
delightedly
interested
in
what
was
said
of
her
and
however
strong
might
have
been
his
desire
to
dismiss
his
guest
in
a
very
summary
manner
or
to
treat
him
with
haughty
reserve
the
graceful
dignity
of
humphreys
manners
made
either
expedient
impossible
lindsay
felt
constrained
to
meet
him
on
his
own
ground
the
ground
of
frankness
and
grew
secretly
still
more
afraid
that
his
real
feelings
should
be
discerned
ellen
from
afar
where
she
could
not
hear
the
words
watched
the
countenances
with
great
anxiety
and
great
admiration
she
could
see
that
while
her
brother
spoke
with
his
usual
perfect
ease
lindsay
was
embarrassed
she
half
read
the
truth
she
saw
the
entire
politeness
while
she
also
saw
the
secret
discomposure
and
she
felt
that
the
politeness
was
forced
from
him
as
the
conversation
went
on
however
she
wonderingly
saw
that
the
cloud
on
his
brow
lessened
she
saw
him
even
smile
and
when
at
last
they
rose
and
she
drew
near
she
almost
thought
her
ears
were
playing
her
false
when
she
heard
lindsay
beg
her
brother
to
go
in
with
him
to
the
company
and
be
presented
to
lindsay
after
a
moment
hesitation
this
invitation
was
accepted
and
they
went
together
into
the
drawing
room
ellen
felt
as
if
she
was
in
a
dream
with
a
face
as
grave
as
usual
but
with
an
inward
exultation
and
rejoicing
in
her
brother
impossible
to
describe
she
saw
him
going
about
among
the
company
talking
to
her
grandmother
yes
and
her
grandmother
did
not
look
less
pleasant
than
usual
recognising
muller
and
in
conversation
with
other
people
whom
he
knew
with
indescribable
glee
ellen
saw
that
lindsay
managed
most
of
the
time
to
be
of
the
same
group
never
more
than
that
night
did
she
triumphantly
think
that
john
could
do
anything
he
finished
the
evening
there
ellen
took
care
not
to
seem
too
much
occupied
with
him
but
she
contrived
to
be
near
when
he
was
talking
with
muller
and
to
hang
upon
her
father
arm
when
he
was
in
john
neighbourhood
and
when
the
latter
had
taken
leave
and
was
in
the
hall
ellen
was
there
before
he
could
be
gone
and
there
came
lindsay
too
behind
her
you
will
come
early
morning
john
come
to
breakfast
humphreys
will
you
said
lindsay
with
sufficient
cordiality
but
humphreys
declined
this
invitation
in
spite
of
the
timid
touch
of
ellen
fingers
upon
his
arm
which
begged
for
a
different
answer
i
will
be
with
you
early
ellie
he
said
however
and
oh
john
said
ellen
suddenly
order
a
horse
and
let
us
have
one
ride
together
let
me
show
you
edinburgh
by
all
means
said
lindsay
let
us
show
you
edinburgh
but
order
no
horses
humphreys
for
mine
are
at
your
service
ellen
other
hand
was
gratefully
laid
upon
her
father
arm
as
this
second
proposal
was
made
and
accepted
let
show
you
edinburgh
said
ellen
to
herself
as
she
and
lindsay
slowly
and
gravely
went
back
through
the
hall
so
there
is
an
end
of
my
fine
morning
but
however
how
foolish
i
am
john
has
his
own
ways
of
doing
things
he
can
make
it
pleasant
in
spite
of
everything
she
went
to
bed
not
to
sleep
indeed
for
a
long
time
but
to
cry
for
joy
and
all
sorts
of
feelings
at
once
good
came
out
of
evil
as
it
often
does
and
as
ellen
heart
presaged
it
would
when
she
arose
the
next
morning
the
ride
was
preceded
by
chat
between
john
lindsay
and
her
grandmother
in
which
the
delight
of
the
evening
before
was
renewed
and
confirmed
ellen
was
obliged
to
look
down
to
hide
the
too
bright
satisfaction
that
she
felt
was
shining
in
her
face
she
took
no
part
in
the
conversation
it
was
enough
to
hear
she
sat
with
charmed
ears
seeing
her
brother
overturning
all
her
father
and
grandmother
prejudices
and
making
his
own
way
to
their
respect
at
least
in
spite
of
themselves
her
marvelling
still
almost
kept
even
pace
with
her
joy
i
knew
he
would
do
what
he
pleased
she
said
to
herself
i
knew
they
could
not
help
that
but
i
did
not
dream
he
would
ever
make
them
him
that
i
never
dreamed
on
the
ride
again
ellen
could
not
wish
that
her
father
were
not
with
them
she
wished
for
nothing
it
was
all
a
maze
of
pleasure
which
there
was
nothing
to
mar
but
the
sense
that
she
would
wake
up
and
find
it
was
a
dream
and
no
not
that
either
it
was
a
solid
good
and
blessing
which
though
it
must
come
to
an
end
she
should
never
lose
for
the
present
there
was
hardly
anything
to
be
thought
of
but
enjoyment
she
shrewdly
guessed
that
lindsay
would
have
enjoyed
it
too
but
for
herself
there
was
a
little
constraint
about
him
still
she
could
see
there
was
none
about
john
in
the
delight
of
his
words
and
looks
and
presence
ellen
half
the
time
forgot
lindsay
entirely
she
had
enough
of
them
she
did
not
for
one
moment
wish
lindsay
had
less
at
last
the
long
beautiful
ride
came
to
an
end
and
the
rest
of
the
morning
soon
sped
away
though
as
ellen
had
expected
she
was
not
permitted
to
spend
any
part
of
it
alone
with
her
brother
lindsay
asked
him
to
dinner
but
this
was
declined
not
till
long
after
he
was
gone
did
ellen
read
humphreys
letter
one
bit
of
it
may
be
given
van
brunt
has
lately
joined
our
little
church
this
has
given
me
great
pleasure
he
has
been
a
regular
attendant
for
a
long
time
before
he
ascribes
much
to
your
instrumentality
but
says
his
first
thoughts
earnest
ones
on
the
subject
of
religion
were
on
the
occasion
of
a
tear
that
fell
from
ellen
eye
upon
his
hand
one
day
when
she
was
talking
to
him
about
the
matter
he
never
got
over
the
impression
in
his
own
words
scared
him
that
was
a
dear
child
i
did
not
know
how
dear
till
i
had
lost
her
i
did
not
know
how
severely
i
should
feel
her
absence
nor
had
i
the
least
notion
when
she
was
with
us
of
many
things
respecting
her
that
i
have
learned
since
i
half
hoped
we
should
yet
have
her
back
but
that
will
not
be
i
shall
be
glad
to
see
you
my
son
the
correspondence
with
john
was
begun
immediately
and
was
the
delight
of
ellen
life
lindsay
and
her
daughter
wished
to
put
a
stop
to
it
but
lindsay
drily
said
that
humphreys
had
frankly
spoken
of
it
before
him
and
as
he
had
made
no
objection
then
he
could
not
now
ellen
puzzled
herself
a
little
to
think
what
could
be
the
third
thing
john
wanted
of
her
but
whatever
it
were
she
was
very
sure
she
would
do
it
for
the
gratification
of
those
who
are
never
satisfied
one
word
shall
be
added
to
wit
that
the
seed
so
early
sown
in
little
ellen
mind
and
so
carefully
tended
by
sundry
hands
grew
in
the
course
of
time
to
all
the
fair
structure
and
comely
perfection
it
had
bid
fair
to
reach
storms
and
winds
that
had
visited
it
did
but
cause
the
root
to
take
deeper
hold
and
at
the
point
of
its
young
maturity
it
happily
fell
again
into
those
hands
that
had
of
all
been
most
successful
in
its
culture
in
other
words
to
speak
intelligibly
ellen
did
in
no
wise
disappoint
her
brother
wishes
nor
he
hers
three
or
four
more
years
of
scottish
discipline
wrought
her
no
ill
they
did
but
serve
to
temper
and
beautify
her
christian
character
and
then
to
her
unspeakable
joy
she
went
back
to
spend
her
life
with
the
friends
and
guardians
she
best
loved
and
to
be
to
them
still
more
than
she
had
been
to
her
scottish
relations

this

a
literary
treasure

buried

many
years
in

forgotten
files

complete
collection

the
hitherto
unpublished
poems

the
gifted

these
poems

early
products

breathe
the
spirit
of
western
life
of
twenty
years
ago
the
reckless
cowboy
the
bucking
broncho
the
hardy
miner
the
english
tenderfoot
the
coquettish
belle
and
all
the
foibles
and
extravagances
of
western
social
life
are
depicted
with
a
naivete
and
satire
tempered
with
sympathy
and
pathos
which
no
other
writer
could
imitate

book
contains
nearly
three
hundred
pages
