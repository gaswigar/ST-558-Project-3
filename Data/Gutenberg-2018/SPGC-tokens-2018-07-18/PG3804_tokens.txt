exclaimed
old
roland
suddenly
after
he
had
remained
motionless
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
water
while
now
and
again
he
very
slightly
lifted
his
line
sunk
in
the
sea
mme
roland
dozing
in
the
stern
by
the
side
of
mme
rosemilly
who
had
been
invited
to
join
the
woke
up
and
turning
her
head
to
look
at
her
husband
said
well
well
and
the
old
fellow
replied
in
a
fury
they
do
not
bite
at
all
i
have
taken
nothing
since
noon
only
men
should
ever
go
fishing
women
always
delay
the
start
till
it
is
too
his
two
sons
pierre
and
jean
who
each
held
a
line
twisted
round
his
forefinger
one
to
port
and
one
to
starboard
both
began
to
laugh
and
jean
remarked
you
are
not
very
polite
to
our
guest
roland
was
abashed
and
apologized
i
beg
your
pardon
mme
rosemilly
but
that
is
just
like
me
i
invite
ladies
because
i
like
to
be
with
them
and
then
as
soon
as
i
feel
the
water
beneath
me
i
think
of
nothing
but
the
mme
roland
was
now
quite
awake
and
gazing
with
a
softened
look
at
the
wide
horizon
of
cliff
and
sea
you
have
had
good
sport
all
the
same
she
murmured
but
her
husband
shook
his
head
in
denial
though
at
the
same
time
he
glanced
complacently
at
the
basket
where
the
fish
caught
by
the
three
men
were
still
breathing
spasmodically
with
a
low
rustle
of
clammy
scales
and
struggling
fins
and
dull
ineffectual
efforts
gasping
in
the
fatal
air
old
roland
took
the
basket
between
his
knees
and
tilted
it
up
making
the
silver
heap
of
creatures
slide
to
the
edge
that
he
might
see
those
lying
at
the
bottom
and
their
became
more
convulsive
while
the
strong
smell
of
their
bodies
a
wholesome
reek
of
brine
came
up
from
the
full
depths
of
the
creel
the
old
fisherman
sniffed
it
eagerly
as
we
smell
at
roses
and
exclaimed
cristi
but
they
are
fresh
enough
and
he
went
on
how
many
did
you
pull
out
doctor
his
eldest
son
pierre
a
man
of
thirty
with
black
whiskers
trimmed
square
like
a
lawyer
his
mustache
and
beard
shaved
away
replied
oh
not
many
three
or
the
father
turned
to
the
younger
and
you
jean
said
he
jean
a
tall
fellow
much
younger
than
his
brother
fair
with
a
full
beard
smiled
and
murmured
much
the
same
as
pierre
four
or
every
time
they
told
the
same
fib
which
delighted
father
roland
he
had
hitched
his
line
round
a
and
folding
his
arms
he
announced
i
will
never
again
try
to
fish
after
noon
after
ten
in
the
morning
it
is
all
over
the
lazy
brutes
will
not
bite
they
are
taking
their
siesta
in
the
and
he
looked
round
at
the
sea
on
all
sides
with
the
satisfied
air
of
a
proprietor
he
was
a
retired
jeweller
who
had
been
led
by
an
inordinate
love
of
seafaring
and
fishing
to
fly
from
the
shop
as
soon
as
he
had
made
enough
money
to
live
in
modest
comfort
on
the
interest
of
his
savings
he
retired
to
le
havre
bought
a
boat
and
became
an
amateur
skipper
his
two
sons
pierre
and
jean
had
remained
at
paris
to
continue
their
studies
and
came
for
the
holidays
from
time
to
time
to
share
their
father
amusements
on
leaving
school
pierre
the
elder
five
years
older
than
jean
had
felt
a
vocation
to
various
professions
and
had
tried
half
a
dozen
in
succession
but
soon
disgusted
with
each
in
turn
he
started
afresh
with
new
hopes
medicine
had
been
his
last
fancy
and
he
had
set
to
work
with
so
much
ardour
that
he
had
just
qualified
after
an
unusually
short
course
of
study
by
a
special
remission
of
time
from
the
minister
he
was
enthusiastic
intelligent
fickle
but
obstinate
full
of
utopias
and
philosophical
notions
jean
who
was
as
fair
as
his
brother
was
dark
as
deliberate
as
his
brother
was
vehement
as
gentle
as
his
brother
was
unforgiving
had
quietly
gone
through
his
studies
for
the
law
and
had
just
taken
his
diploma
as
a
licentiate
at
the
time
when
pierre
had
taken
his
in
medicine
so
they
were
now
having
a
little
rest
at
home
and
both
looked
forward
to
settling
in
havre
if
they
could
find
a
satisfactory
opening
but
a
vague
jealousy
one
of
those
dormant
jealousies
which
grow
up
between
brothers
or
sisters
and
slowly
ripen
till
they
burst
on
the
occasion
of
a
marriage
perhaps
or
of
some
good
fortune
happening
to
one
of
them
kept
them
on
the
alert
in
a
sort
of
brotherly
and
animosity
they
were
fond
of
each
other
it
is
true
but
they
watched
each
other
pierre
five
years
old
when
jean
was
born
had
looked
with
the
eyes
of
a
little
petted
animal
at
that
other
little
animal
which
had
suddenly
come
to
lie
in
his
father
and
mother
arms
and
to
be
loved
and
fondled
by
them
jean
from
his
birth
had
always
been
a
pattern
of
sweetness
gentleness
and
good
temper
and
pierre
had
by
degrees
begun
to
chafe
at
hearing
the
praises
of
this
great
lad
whose
sweetness
in
his
eyes
was
indolence
whose
gentleness
was
stupidity
and
whose
kindliness
was
blindness
his
parents
whose
dream
for
their
sons
was
some
respectable
and
undistinguished
calling
blamed
him
for
so
often
changing
his
mind
for
his
fits
of
enthusiasm
his
abortive
beginnings
and
all
his
ineffectual
impulses
towards
generous
ideas
and
the
liberal
professions
since
he
had
grown
to
manhood
they
no
longer
said
in
so
many
words
look
at
jean
and
follow
his
example
but
every
time
he
heard
them
say
jean
did
this
jean
does
that
he
understood
their
meaning
and
the
hint
the
words
conveyed
their
mother
an
orderly
person
a
thrifty
and
rather
sentimental
woman
of
the
middle
class
with
the
soul
of
a
was
constantly
quenching
the
little
rivalries
between
her
two
big
sons
to
which
the
petty
events
of
their
life
constantly
gave
rise
another
little
circumstance
too
just
now
disturbed
her
peace
of
mind
and
she
was
in
fear
of
some
complications
for
in
the
course
of
the
winter
while
her
boys
were
finishing
their
studies
each
in
his
own
line
she
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
neighbour
mme
rosemilly
the
widow
of
a
captain
of
a
merchantman
who
had
died
at
sea
two
years
before
the
young
widow
quite
young
only
a
woman
of
strong
intellect
who
knew
life
by
instinct
as
the
free
animals
do
as
though
she
had
seen
gone
through
understood
and
weighted
every
conceivable
contingency
and
judged
them
with
a
wholesome
strict
and
benevolent
mind
had
fallen
into
the
habit
of
calling
to
work
or
chat
for
an
hour
in
the
evening
with
these
friendly
neighbours
who
would
give
her
a
cup
of
tea
father
roland
always
goaded
on
by
his
seafaring
craze
would
question
their
new
friend
about
the
departed
captain
and
she
would
talk
of
him
and
his
voyages
and
his
tales
without
hesitation
like
a
resigned
and
reasonable
woman
who
loves
life
and
respects
death
the
two
sons
on
their
return
finding
the
pretty
widow
quite
at
home
in
the
house
forthwith
began
to
court
her
less
from
any
wish
to
charm
her
than
from
the
desire
to
cut
each
other
out
their
mother
being
practical
and
prudent
sincerely
hoped
that
one
of
them
might
win
the
young
widow
for
she
was
rich
but
then
she
would
have
liked
that
the
other
should
not
be
grieved
mme
rosemilly
was
fair
with
blue
eyes
a
mass
of
light
waving
hair
fluttering
at
the
least
breath
of
wind
and
an
alert
daring
pugnacious
little
way
with
her
which
did
not
in
the
least
answer
to
the
sober
method
of
her
mind
she
already
seemed
to
like
jean
best
attracted
no
doubt
by
an
affinity
of
nature
this
preference
however
she
betrayed
only
by
an
almost
imperceptible
difference
of
voice
and
look
and
also
by
occasionally
asking
his
opinion
she
seemed
to
guess
that
views
would
support
her
own
while
those
of
pierre
must
inevitably
be
different
when
she
spoke
of
the
doctor
ideas
on
politics
art
philosophy
or
morals
she
would
sometimes
say
your
then
he
would
look
at
her
with
the
cold
gleam
of
an
accuser
drawing
up
an
indictment
against
women
all
women
poor
weak
things
never
till
his
sons
came
home
had
roland
invited
her
to
join
his
fishing
expeditions
nor
had
he
ever
taken
his
wife
for
he
liked
to
put
off
before
daybreak
with
his
ally
captain
beausire
a
master
mariner
retired
whom
he
had
first
met
on
the
quay
at
high
tides
and
with
whom
he
had
struck
up
an
intimacy
and
the
old
sailor
papagris
known
as
jean
bart
in
whose
charge
the
boat
was
left
but
one
evening
of
the
week
before
mme
rosemilly
who
had
been
dining
with
them
remarked
it
must
be
great
fun
to
go
out
the
jeweller
flattered
by
her
interest
and
suddenly
fired
with
the
wish
to
share
his
favourite
sport
with
her
and
to
make
a
convert
after
the
manner
of
priests
exclaimed
would
you
like
to
come
to
be
sure
i
next
tuesday
yes
next
are
you
the
woman
to
be
ready
to
start
at
five
in
the
morning
she
exclaimed
in
horror
no
indeed
that
is
too
he
was
disappointed
and
chilled
suddenly
doubting
her
true
vocation
however
he
said
at
what
hour
can
you
be
ready
well
at
nine
not
before
no
not
before
even
that
is
very
the
old
fellow
hesitated
he
certainly
would
catch
nothing
for
when
the
sun
has
warmed
the
sea
the
fish
bite
no
more
but
the
two
brothers
had
eagerly
pressed
the
scheme
and
organized
and
arranged
everything
there
and
then
so
on
the
following
tuesday
the
pearl
had
dropped
anchor
under
the
white
rocks
of
cape
la
heve
they
had
fished
till
midday
then
they
had
slept
awhile
and
then
fished
again
without
catching
anything
and
then
it
was
that
father
roland
perceiving
rather
late
that
all
that
mme
rosemilly
really
enjoyed
and
cared
for
was
the
sail
on
the
sea
and
seeing
that
his
lines
hung
motionless
had
uttered
in
a
spirit
of
unreasonable
annoyance
that
vehement
tschah
which
applied
as
much
to
the
pathetic
widow
as
to
the
creatures
he
could
not
catch
now
he
contemplated
the
spoil
his
fish
with
the
joyful
thrill
of
a
miser
seeing
as
he
looked
up
at
the
sky
that
the
sun
was
getting
low
well
boys
said
he
suppose
we
turn
the
young
men
hauled
in
their
lines
coiled
them
up
cleaned
the
hooks
and
stuck
them
into
corks
and
sat
waiting
roland
stood
up
to
look
out
like
a
captain
no
wind
said
he
you
will
have
to
pull
young
and
suddenly
extending
one
arm
to
the
northward
he
exclaimed
here
comes
the
packet
from
away
over
the
level
sea
spread
out
like
a
blue
sheet
vast
and
sheeny
and
shot
with
flame
and
gold
an
inky
cloud
was
visible
against
the
rosy
sky
in
the
quarter
to
which
he
pointed
and
below
it
they
could
make
out
the
hull
of
the
steamer
which
looked
tiny
at
such
a
distance
and
to
southward
other
wreaths
of
smoke
numbers
of
them
could
be
seen
all
converging
towards
the
havre
pier
now
scarcely
visible
as
a
white
streak
with
the
lighthouse
upright
like
a
horn
at
the
end
of
it
roland
asked
is
not
the
normandie
due
and
jean
replied
yes
give
me
my
glass
i
fancy
i
see
her
out
the
father
pulled
out
the
copper
tube
adjusted
it
to
his
eye
sought
the
speck
and
then
delighted
to
have
seen
it
exclaimed
yes
yes
there
she
is
i
know
her
two
funnels
would
you
like
to
look
mme
rosemilly
she
took
the
telescope
and
directed
it
towards
the
atlantic
horizon
without
being
able
however
to
find
the
vessel
for
she
could
distinguish
nothing
nothing
but
blue
with
a
coloured
halo
round
it
a
circular
rainbow
and
then
all
manner
of
queer
things
winking
eclipses
which
made
her
feel
sick
she
said
as
she
returned
the
glass
i
never
could
see
with
that
thing
it
used
to
put
my
husband
in
quite
a
rage
he
would
stand
for
hours
at
the
windows
watching
the
ships
old
roland
much
put
out
retorted
then
it
must
be
some
defect
in
your
eye
for
my
glass
is
a
very
good
then
he
offered
it
to
his
wife
would
you
like
to
look
no
thank
you
i
know
before
hand
that
i
could
not
see
through
mme
roland
a
woman
of
but
who
did
not
look
it
seemed
to
be
enjoying
this
excursion
and
this
waning
day
more
than
any
of
the
party
her
chestnut
hair
was
only
just
beginning
to
show
streaks
of
white
she
had
a
calm
reasonable
face
a
kind
and
happy
way
with
her
which
it
was
a
pleasure
to
see
her
son
pierre
was
wont
to
say
that
she
knew
the
value
of
money
but
this
did
not
hinder
her
from
enjoying
the
delights
of
dreaming
she
was
fond
of
reading
of
novels
and
poetry
not
for
their
value
as
works
of
art
but
for
the
sake
of
the
tender
melancholy
mood
they
would
induce
in
her
a
line
of
poetry
often
but
a
poor
one
often
a
bad
one
would
touch
the
little
chord
as
she
expressed
it
and
give
her
the
sense
of
some
mysterious
desire
almost
realized
and
she
delighted
in
these
faint
emotions
which
brought
a
little
flutter
to
her
soul
otherwise
as
strictly
kept
as
a
ledger
since
settling
at
havre
she
had
become
perceptibly
stouter
and
her
figure
which
had
been
very
supple
and
slight
had
grown
heavier
this
day
on
the
sea
had
been
delightful
to
her
her
husband
without
being
brutal
was
rough
with
her
as
a
man
who
is
the
despot
of
his
shop
is
apt
to
be
rough
without
anger
or
hatred
to
such
men
to
give
an
order
is
to
swear
he
controlled
himself
in
the
presence
of
strangers
but
in
private
he
let
loose
and
gave
himself
terrible
vent
though
he
was
himself
afraid
of
every
one
she
in
sheer
horror
of
the
turmoil
of
scenes
of
useless
explanations
always
gave
way
and
never
asked
for
anything
for
a
very
long
time
she
had
not
ventured
to
ask
roland
to
take
her
out
in
the
boat
so
she
had
joyfully
hailed
this
opportunity
and
was
keenly
enjoying
the
rare
and
new
pleasure
from
the
moment
when
they
started
she
surrendered
herself
completely
body
and
soul
to
the
soft
gliding
motion
over
the
waves
she
was
not
thinking
her
mind
was
not
wandering
through
either
memories
or
hopes
it
seemed
to
her
as
though
her
heart
like
her
body
was
floating
on
something
soft
and
liquid
and
delicious
which
rocked
and
lulled
it
when
their
father
gave
the
word
to
return
come
take
your
places
at
the
oars
she
smiled
to
see
her
sons
her
two
great
boys
take
off
their
jackets
and
roll
up
their
on
their
bare
arms
pierre
who
was
nearest
to
the
two
women
took
the
stroke
oar
jean
the
other
and
they
sat
waiting
till
the
skipper
should
say
give
way
for
he
insisted
on
everything
being
done
according
to
strict
rule
simultaneously
as
if
by
a
single
effort
they
dipped
the
oars
and
lying
back
pulling
with
all
their
might
began
a
struggle
to
display
their
strength
they
had
come
out
easily
under
sail
but
the
breeze
had
died
away
and
the
masculine
pride
of
the
two
brothers
was
suddenly
aroused
by
the
prospect
of
measuring
their
powers
when
they
went
out
alone
with
their
father
they
plied
the
oars
without
any
steering
for
roland
would
be
busy
getting
the
lines
ready
while
he
kept
a
lookout
in
the
boat
course
guiding
it
by
a
sign
or
a
word
easy
jean
and
you
pierre
put
your
back
into
or
he
would
say
now
then
number
one
come
number
two
a
little
elbow
then
the
one
who
had
been
dreaming
pulled
harder
the
one
who
had
got
excited
eased
down
and
the
boat
head
came
round
but
they
meant
to
display
their
biceps
pierre
arms
were
hairy
somewhat
lean
but
sinewy
jean
were
round
and
white
and
rosy
and
the
knot
of
muscles
moved
under
the
skin
at
first
pierre
had
the
advantage
with
his
teeth
set
his
brow
knit
his
legs
rigid
his
hands
clinched
on
the
oar
he
made
it
bend
from
end
to
end
at
every
stroke
and
the
pearl
was
veering
landward
father
roland
sitting
in
the
bows
so
as
to
leave
the
stern
seat
to
the
two
women
wasted
his
breath
shouting
easy
number
one
pull
harder
number
two
pierre
pulled
harder
in
his
frenzy
and
number
two
could
not
keep
time
with
his
wild
stroke
at
last
the
skipper
cried
stop
her
the
two
oars
were
lifted
simultaneously
and
then
by
his
father
orders
jean
pulled
alone
for
a
few
minutes
but
from
that
moment
he
had
it
all
his
own
way
he
grew
eager
and
warmed
to
his
work
while
pierre
out
of
breath
and
exhausted
by
his
first
vigorous
spurt
was
lax
and
panting
four
times
running
father
roland
made
them
stop
while
the
elder
took
breath
so
as
to
get
the
boat
into
her
right
course
again
then
the
doctor
humiliated
and
fuming
his
forehead
dropping
with
sweat
his
cheeks
white
stammered
out
i
can
not
think
what
has
come
over
me
i
have
a
stitch
in
my
side
i
started
very
well
but
it
has
pulled
me
jean
asked
shall
i
pull
alone
with
both
oars
for
a
time
no
thanks
it
will
go
and
their
mother
somewhat
vexed
said
why
pierre
what
rhyme
or
reason
is
there
in
getting
into
such
a
state
you
are
not
a
and
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
set
to
once
more
mme
rosemilly
pretended
not
to
see
not
to
understand
not
to
hear
her
fair
head
went
back
with
an
engaging
little
jerk
every
time
the
boat
moved
forward
making
the
fine
wayward
hairs
flutter
about
her
temples
but
father
roland
presently
called
out
look
the
prince
albert
is
catching
us
up
they
all
looked
round
long
and
low
in
the
water
with
her
two
raking
funnels
and
two
yellow
like
two
round
cheeks
the
southampton
packet
came
ploughing
on
at
full
steam
crowded
with
passengers
under
open
parasols
its
hurrying
noisy
beating
up
the
water
which
fell
again
in
foam
gave
it
an
appearance
of
haste
as
of
a
courier
pressed
for
time
and
the
upright
stem
cut
through
the
water
throwing
up
two
thin
translucent
waves
which
glided
off
along
the
hull
when
it
had
come
quite
near
the
pearl
father
roland
lifted
his
hat
the
ladies
shook
their
handkerchiefs
and
half
a
dozen
parasols
eagerly
waved
on
board
the
steamboat
responded
to
this
salute
as
she
went
on
her
way
leaving
behind
her
a
few
broad
undulations
on
the
still
and
glassy
surface
of
the
sea
there
were
other
vessels
each
with
its
smoky
cap
coming
in
from
every
part
of
the
horizon
towards
the
short
white
jetty
which
swallowed
them
up
one
after
another
like
a
mouth
and
the
fishing
barks
and
lighter
craft
with
broad
sails
and
slender
masts
stealing
across
the
sky
in
tow
of
inconspicuous
tugs
were
coming
in
faster
and
slower
towards
the
devouring
ogre
who
from
time
to
time
seemed
to
have
had
a
surfeit
and
spewed
out
to
the
open
sea
another
fleet
of
steamers
brigs
schooners
and
vessels
with
their
tangled
mass
of
rigging
the
hurrying
steamships
flew
off
to
the
right
and
left
over
the
smooth
bosom
of
the
ocean
while
sailing
vessels
cast
off
by
the
which
had
hauled
them
out
lay
motionless
dressing
themselves
from
the
to
the
in
canvas
white
or
brown
and
ruddy
in
the
setting
sun
mme
roland
with
her
eyes
murmured
good
heavens
how
beautiful
the
sea
is
and
mme
rosemilly
replied
with
a
long
sigh
which
however
had
no
sadness
in
it
yes
but
it
is
sometimes
very
cruel
all
the
roland
exclaimed
look
there
is
the
normandie
just
going
in
a
big
ship
is
she
then
he
described
the
coast
opposite
far
far
away
on
the
other
side
of
the
mouth
of
the
seine
that
mouth
extended
over
twenty
kilometres
said
he
he
pointed
out
villerville
trouville
houlgate
luc
arromanches
the
little
river
of
caen
and
the
rocks
of
calvados
which
make
the
coast
unsafe
as
far
as
cherbourg
then
he
enlarged
on
the
question
of
the
in
the
seine
which
shift
at
every
tide
so
that
even
the
pilots
of
quilleboeuf
are
at
fault
if
they
do
not
survey
the
channel
every
day
he
bid
them
notice
how
the
town
of
havre
divided
upper
from
lower
normandy
in
lower
normandy
the
shore
sloped
down
to
the
sea
in
fields
and
meadows
the
coast
of
upper
normandy
on
the
contrary
was
steep
a
high
cliff
ravined
cleft
and
towering
forming
an
immense
white
rampart
all
the
way
to
dunkirk
while
in
each
hollow
a
village
or
a
port
lay
hidden
etretat
fecamp
treport
dieppe
and
the
rest
the
two
women
did
not
listen
torpid
with
comfort
and
impressed
by
the
sight
of
the
ocean
covered
with
vessels
rushing
to
and
fro
like
wild
beasts
about
their
den
they
sat
speechless
somewhat
awed
by
the
soothing
and
gorgeous
sunset
roland
alone
talked
on
without
end
he
was
one
of
those
whom
nothing
can
disturb
women
whose
nerves
are
more
sensitive
sometimes
feel
without
knowing
why
that
the
sound
of
useless
speech
is
as
irritating
as
an
insult
pierre
and
jean
who
had
calmed
down
were
rowing
slowly
and
the
pearl
was
making
for
the
harbour
a
tiny
thing
among
those
huge
vessels
when
they
came
alongside
of
the
quay
papagris
who
was
waiting
there
gave
his
hand
to
the
ladies
to
help
them
out
and
they
took
the
way
into
the
town
a
large
crowd
the
crowd
which
haunts
the
pier
every
day
at
high
tide
was
also
drifting
homeward
mme
roland
and
mme
rosemilly
led
the
way
followed
by
the
three
men
as
they
went
up
the
rue
de
paris
they
stopped
now
and
then
in
front
of
a
milliner
or
a
jeweller
shop
to
look
at
a
bonnet
or
an
ornament
then
after
making
their
comments
they
went
on
again
in
front
of
the
place
de
la
bourse
roland
paused
as
he
did
every
day
to
gaze
at
the
docks
full
of
vessels
the
du
with
other
docks
beyond
where
the
huge
hulls
lay
side
by
side
closely
packed
in
rows
four
or
five
deep
and
masts
innumerable
along
several
kilometres
of
quays
the
endless
masts
with
their
yards
poles
and
rigging
gave
this
great
gap
in
the
heart
of
the
town
the
look
of
a
dead
forest
above
this
leafless
forest
the
gulls
were
wheeling
and
watching
to
pounce
like
a
falling
stone
on
any
scraps
flung
overboard
a
sailor
boy
fixing
a
pulley
to
a
looked
as
if
he
had
gone
up
there
will
you
dine
with
us
without
any
sort
of
ceremony
just
that
we
may
end
the
day
together
said
mme
roland
to
her
friend
to
be
sure
i
will
with
pleasure
i
accept
equally
without
ceremony
it
would
be
dismal
to
go
home
and
be
alone
this
pierre
who
had
heard
and
who
was
beginning
to
be
restless
under
the
young
woman
indifference
muttered
to
himself
well
the
widow
is
taking
root
now
it
would
for
some
days
past
he
had
spoken
of
her
as
the
the
word
harmless
in
itself
irritated
jean
merely
by
the
tone
given
to
it
which
to
him
seemed
spiteful
and
offensive
the
three
men
spoke
not
another
word
till
they
reached
the
threshold
of
their
own
house
it
was
a
narrow
one
consisting
of
a
and
two
floors
above
in
the
rue
the
maid
josephine
a
girl
of
nineteen
a
rustic
at
low
wages
gifted
to
excess
with
the
startled
animal
expression
of
a
peasant
opened
the
door
went
up
stairs
at
her
master
heels
to
the
which
was
on
the
first
floor
and
then
said
a
gentleman
called
three
old
roland
who
never
spoke
to
her
without
shouting
and
swearing
cried
out
who
do
you
say
called
in
the
devil
name
she
never
winced
at
her
master
roaring
voice
and
replied
a
gentleman
from
the
what
lawyer
why
who
else
and
what
did
this
gentleman
say
that
will
call
in
himself
in
the
course
of
the
maitre
lecanu
was
roland
lawyer
and
in
a
way
his
friend
managing
his
business
for
him
for
him
to
send
word
that
he
would
call
in
the
evening
something
urgent
and
important
must
be
in
the
wind
and
the
four
rolands
looked
at
each
other
disturbed
by
the
announcement
as
folks
of
small
fortune
are
wont
to
be
at
any
intervention
of
a
lawyer
with
its
suggestions
of
contracts
inheritance
lawsuits
all
sorts
of
desirable
or
formidable
contingencies
the
father
after
a
few
moments
of
silence
muttered
what
on
earth
can
it
mean
mme
rosemilly
began
to
laugh
why
a
legacy
of
course
i
am
sure
of
it
i
bring
good
but
they
did
not
expect
the
death
of
any
one
who
might
leave
them
anything
mme
roland
who
had
a
good
memory
for
relationships
began
to
think
over
all
their
connections
on
her
husband
side
and
on
her
own
to
trace
up
pedigrees
and
the
ramifications
of
before
even
taking
off
her
bonnet
she
said
i
say
father
she
called
her
husband
father
at
home
and
sometimes
monsieur
roland
before
strangers
tell
me
do
you
remember
who
it
was
that
joseph
lebru
married
for
the
second
time
yes
a
little
girl
named
dumenil
a
stationer
had
they
any
children
i
should
think
so
four
or
five
at
not
from
that
quarter
she
was
quite
eager
already
in
her
search
she
caught
at
the
hope
of
some
added
ease
dropping
from
the
sky
but
pierre
who
was
very
fond
of
his
mother
who
knew
her
to
be
somewhat
visionary
and
feared
she
might
be
disappointed
a
little
grieved
a
little
saddened
if
the
news
were
bad
instead
of
good
checked
her
do
not
get
excited
mother
there
is
no
rich
american
uncle
for
my
part
i
should
sooner
fancy
that
it
is
about
a
marriage
for
every
one
was
surprised
at
the
suggestion
and
jean
was
a
little
ruffled
by
his
brother
having
spoken
of
it
before
mme
rosemilly
and
why
for
me
rather
than
for
you
the
hypothesis
is
very
disputable
you
are
the
elder
you
therefore
would
be
the
first
to
be
thought
of
besides
i
do
not
wish
to
pierre
smiled
sneeringly
are
you
in
love
then
and
the
other
much
put
out
retorted
is
it
necessary
that
a
man
should
be
in
love
because
he
does
not
care
to
marry
yet
ah
there
you
are
that
sets
it
right
you
are
granted
that
i
am
waiting
if
you
will
have
it
but
old
roland
who
had
been
listening
and
cogitating
suddenly
hit
upon
the
most
probable
solution
bless
me
what
fools
we
are
to
be
racking
our
brains
maitre
lecanu
is
our
very
good
friend
he
knows
that
pierre
is
looking
out
for
a
medical
partnership
and
jean
for
a
lawyer
office
and
he
has
found
something
to
suit
one
of
this
was
so
obvious
and
likely
that
every
one
accepted
it
dinner
is
ready
said
the
maid
and
they
all
hurried
off
to
their
rooms
to
wash
their
hands
before
sitting
down
to
table
ten
minutes
later
they
were
at
dinner
in
the
little
on
the
at
first
they
were
silent
but
presently
roland
began
again
in
amazement
at
this
lawyer
visit
for
after
all
why
did
he
not
write
why
should
he
have
sent
his
clerk
three
times
why
is
he
coming
himself
pierre
thought
it
quite
natural
an
immediate
decision
is
required
no
doubt
and
perhaps
there
are
certain
confidential
conditions
which
it
does
not
do
to
put
into
still
they
were
all
puzzled
and
all
four
a
little
annoyed
at
having
invited
a
stranger
who
would
be
in
the
way
of
their
discussing
and
deciding
on
what
should
be
done
they
had
just
gone
upstairs
again
when
the
lawyer
was
announced
roland
flew
to
meet
him
my
dear
maitre
said
he
giving
his
visitor
the
title
which
in
france
is
the
official
prefix
to
the
name
of
every
lawyer
mme
rosemilly
rose
i
am
going
she
said
i
am
very
a
faint
attempt
was
made
to
detain
her
but
she
would
not
consent
and
went
home
without
either
of
the
three
men
offering
to
escort
her
as
they
always
had
done
mme
roland
did
the
honours
eagerly
to
their
visitor
a
cup
of
coffee
monsieur
no
thank
you
i
have
just
had
a
cup
of
tea
then
thank
you
i
will
accept
one
later
first
we
must
attend
to
the
deep
silence
which
succeeded
this
remark
was
broken
only
by
the
regular
ticking
of
the
clock
and
below
stairs
the
clatter
of
saucepans
which
the
girl
was
cleaning
too
stupid
even
to
listen
at
the
door
the
lawyer
went
on
did
you
in
paris
know
a
certain
marechal
leon
marechal
and
mme
roland
both
exclaimed
at
once
i
should
think
so
he
was
a
friend
of
yours
roland
replied
our
best
friend
monsieur
but
a
fanatic
for
paris
never
to
be
got
away
from
the
boulevard
he
was
a
head
clerk
in
the
exchequer
office
i
have
never
seen
him
since
i
left
the
capital
and
latterly
we
had
ceased
writing
to
each
other
when
people
are
far
apart
you
know
the
lawyer
gravely
put
in
m
marechal
is
both
man
and
wife
responded
with
the
little
movement
of
pained
surprise
genuine
or
false
but
always
ready
with
which
such
news
is
received
maitre
lecanu
went
on
my
colleague
in
paris
has
just
communicated
to
me
the
main
item
of
his
will
by
which
he
makes
your
son
jean
monsieur
jean
roland
his
sole
they
were
all
too
much
amazed
to
utter
a
single
word
mme
roland
was
the
first
to
control
her
emotion
and
stammered
out
good
heavens
poor
leon
our
poor
friend
dear
me
dear
me
dead
the
tears
started
to
her
eyes
a
woman
silent
tears
drops
of
grief
from
her
very
soul
which
trickle
down
her
cheeks
and
seem
so
very
sad
being
so
clear
but
roland
was
thinking
less
of
the
loss
than
of
the
prospect
announced
still
he
dared
not
at
once
inquire
into
the
clauses
of
the
will
and
the
amount
of
the
fortune
so
to
work
round
to
these
interesting
facts
he
asked
and
what
did
he
die
of
poor
marechal
maitre
lecanu
did
not
know
in
the
least
all
i
know
is
said
he
that
dying
without
any
direct
heirs
he
has
left
the
whole
of
his
fortune
about
twenty
thousand
francs
a
year
in
three
per
cents
to
your
second
son
whom
he
has
known
from
his
birth
up
and
judges
worthy
of
the
legacy
if
jean
should
refuse
the
money
it
is
to
go
to
the
foundling
old
roland
could
not
conceal
his
delight
and
exclaimed
sacristi
it
is
the
thought
of
a
kind
heart
and
if
i
had
had
no
heir
i
would
not
have
forgotten
him
he
was
a
true
the
lawyer
smiled
i
was
very
glad
he
said
to
announce
the
event
to
you
myself
it
is
always
a
pleasure
to
be
the
bearer
of
good
it
had
not
struck
him
that
this
good
news
was
that
of
the
death
of
a
friend
of
roland
best
friend
and
the
old
man
himself
had
suddenly
forgotten
the
intimacy
he
had
but
just
spoken
of
with
so
much
conviction
only
mme
roland
and
her
sons
still
looked
mournful
she
indeed
was
still
shedding
a
few
tears
wiping
her
eyes
with
her
handkerchief
which
she
then
pressed
to
her
lips
to
smother
her
deep
sobs
the
doctor
murmured
he
was
a
good
fellow
very
affectionate
he
often
invited
us
to
dine
with
him
my
brother
and
jean
with
glittering
eyes
laid
his
hand
on
his
handsome
fair
beard
a
familiar
gesture
with
him
and
drew
his
fingers
down
it
to
the
tip
of
the
last
hairs
as
if
to
pull
it
longer
and
thinner
twice
his
lips
parted
to
utter
some
decent
remark
but
after
long
meditation
he
could
only
say
this
yes
he
was
certainly
fond
of
me
he
would
always
embrace
me
when
i
went
to
see
but
his
father
thoughts
had
set
off
at
a
gallop
galloping
round
this
inheritance
to
come
nay
already
in
hand
this
money
lurking
behind
the
door
which
would
walk
in
quite
soon
at
a
word
of
consent
and
there
is
no
possible
difficulty
in
the
way
he
asked
no
lawsuit
no
one
to
dispute
it
maitre
lecanu
seemed
quite
easy
no
my
paris
correspondent
states
that
everything
is
quite
clear
jean
has
only
to
sign
his
good
then
then
the
fortune
is
quite
clear
perfectly
all
the
necessary
formalities
have
been
gone
through
suddenly
the
old
jeweller
had
an
impulse
of
shame
obscure
instinctive
and
fleeting
shame
of
his
eagerness
to
be
informed
and
he
added
you
understand
that
i
ask
all
these
questions
immediately
so
as
to
save
my
son
unpleasant
consequences
which
he
might
not
foresee
sometimes
there
are
debts
embarrassing
liabilities
what
not
and
a
legatee
finds
himself
in
an
inextricable
after
all
i
am
not
the
heir
but
i
think
first
of
the
little
they
were
accustomed
to
speak
of
jean
among
themselves
as
the
little
one
though
he
was
much
bigger
than
pierre
suddenly
mme
roland
seemed
to
wake
from
a
dream
to
recall
some
remote
fact
a
thing
almost
forgotten
that
she
had
heard
long
ago
and
of
which
she
was
not
altogether
sure
she
inquired
doubtingly
were
you
not
saying
that
our
poor
friend
marechal
had
left
his
fortune
to
my
little
jean
yes
and
she
went
on
simply
i
am
much
pleased
to
hear
it
it
proves
that
he
was
attached
to
roland
had
risen
and
would
you
wish
my
dear
sir
that
my
son
should
at
once
sign
his
acceptance
no
no
roland
at
my
office
at
two
if
that
suits
yes
to
be
sure
yes
indeed
i
should
think
then
mme
roland
who
had
also
risen
and
who
was
smiling
after
her
tears
went
up
to
the
lawyer
and
laying
her
hand
on
the
back
of
his
chair
while
she
looked
at
him
with
the
pathetic
eyes
of
a
grateful
mother
she
said
and
now
for
that
cup
of
tea
monsieur
lecanu
now
i
will
accept
it
with
pleasure
the
maid
on
being
summoned
brought
in
first
some
dry
biscuits
in
deep
tin
boxes
those
crisp
insipid
english
cakes
which
seem
to
have
been
made
for
a
parrot
beak
and
soldered
into
metal
cases
for
a
voyage
round
the
world
next
she
fetched
some
little
gray
linen
doilies
folded
square
those
which
in
thrifty
families
never
get
washed
a
third
time
she
came
in
with
the
and
cups
then
she
departed
to
heat
the
water
they
sat
waiting
no
one
could
talk
they
had
too
much
to
think
about
and
nothing
to
say
mme
roland
alone
attempted
a
few
commonplace
remarks
she
gave
an
account
of
the
fishing
excursion
and
sang
the
praises
of
the
pearl
and
of
mme
rosemilly
charming
charming
the
lawyer
said
again
and
again
roland
leaning
against
the
marble
as
if
it
were
winter
and
the
fire
burning
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
lips
puckered
for
a
whistle
could
not
keep
still
tortured
by
the
invincible
desire
to
give
vent
to
his
delight
the
two
brothers
in
two
that
matched
one
on
each
side
of
the
stared
in
front
of
them
in
similar
attitudes
full
of
dissimilar
expressions
at
last
the
tea
appeared
the
lawyer
took
a
cup
sugared
it
and
drank
it
after
having
crumbled
into
it
a
little
cake
which
was
too
hard
to
crunch
then
he
rose
shook
hands
and
departed
then
it
is
understood
repeated
roland
at
your
place
at
two
quite
so
at
jean
had
not
spoken
a
word
when
their
guest
had
gone
silence
fell
again
till
father
roland
clapped
his
two
hands
on
his
younger
son
shoulders
crying
well
you
devilish
lucky
dog
you
do
embrace
me
then
jean
smiled
he
embraced
his
father
saying
it
had
not
struck
me
as
the
old
man
was
beside
himself
with
glee
he
walked
about
the
room
strummed
on
the
furniture
with
his
clumsy
nails
turned
about
on
his
heels
and
kept
saying
what
luck
what
luck
now
that
is
really
what
i
call
luck
pierre
asked
then
you
used
to
know
this
marechal
well
and
his
father
replied
i
believe
why
he
used
to
spend
every
evening
at
our
house
surely
you
remember
he
used
to
fetch
you
from
school
on
and
often
took
you
back
again
after
dinner
why
the
very
day
when
jean
was
born
it
was
he
who
went
for
the
doctor
he
had
been
breakfasting
with
us
when
your
mother
was
taken
of
course
we
knew
at
once
what
it
meant
and
he
set
off
in
his
hurry
he
took
my
hat
instead
of
his
own
i
remember
that
because
we
had
a
good
laugh
over
it
afterward
it
is
very
likely
that
he
may
have
thought
of
that
when
he
was
dying
and
as
he
had
no
heir
he
may
have
said
to
himself
remember
helping
to
bring
that
youngster
into
the
world
so
i
will
leave
him
my
savings
mme
roland
sunk
in
a
deep
chair
seemed
lost
in
reminiscences
once
more
she
murmured
as
though
she
were
thinking
aloud
ah
he
was
a
good
friend
very
devoted
very
faithful
a
rare
soul
in
these
jean
got
up
i
shall
go
out
for
a
little
walk
he
said
his
father
was
surprised
and
tried
to
keep
him
they
had
much
to
talk
about
plans
to
be
made
decisions
to
be
formed
but
the
young
man
insisted
declaring
that
he
had
an
engagement
besides
there
would
be
time
enough
for
settling
everything
before
he
came
into
possession
of
his
inheritance
so
he
went
away
for
he
wished
to
be
alone
to
reflect
pierre
on
his
part
said
that
he
too
was
going
out
and
after
a
few
minutes
followed
his
brother
as
soon
as
he
was
alone
with
his
wife
father
roland
took
her
in
his
arms
kissed
her
a
dozen
times
on
each
cheek
and
replying
to
a
reproach
she
had
often
brought
against
him
said
you
see
my
dearest
that
it
would
have
been
no
good
to
stay
any
longer
in
paris
and
work
for
the
children
till
i
dropped
instead
of
coming
here
to
recruit
my
health
since
fortune
drops
on
us
from
the
she
was
quite
serious
it
drops
from
the
skies
on
jean
she
said
but
pierre
pierre
but
he
is
a
doctor
he
will
make
plenty
of
money
besides
his
brother
will
surely
do
something
for
no
he
would
not
take
it
besides
this
legacy
is
for
jean
only
for
jean
pierre
will
find
himself
at
a
great
the
old
fellow
seemed
perplexed
well
then
we
will
leave
him
rather
more
in
our
no
that
again
would
not
be
quite
drat
it
all
he
exclaimed
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
in
the
matter
you
always
hit
on
a
whole
heap
of
disagreeable
ideas
you
must
spoil
all
my
pleasures
well
i
am
going
to
bed
all
the
same
i
call
it
good
luck
jolly
good
luck
and
he
went
off
delighted
in
spite
of
everything
and
without
a
word
of
regret
for
the
friend
so
generous
in
his
death
mme
roland
sat
thinking
again
in
front
of
the
lamp
which
was
burning
out
chapter
ii
as
soon
as
he
got
out
pierre
made
his
way
to
the
rue
de
paris
the
of
havre
brightly
lighted
up
lively
and
noisy
the
rather
sharp
air
of
the
seacoast
kissed
his
face
and
he
walked
slowly
his
stick
under
his
arm
and
his
hands
behind
his
back
he
was
ill
at
ease
oppressed
out
of
heart
as
one
is
after
hearing
unpleasant
tidings
he
was
not
distressed
by
any
definite
thought
and
he
would
have
been
puzzled
to
account
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
for
this
dejection
of
spirit
and
heaviness
of
limb
he
was
hurt
somewhere
without
knowing
where
somewhere
within
him
there
was
a
of
pain
one
of
those
almost
imperceptible
wounds
which
we
can
not
lay
a
finger
on
but
which
incommode
us
tire
us
depress
us
irritate
us
a
slight
and
occult
pang
as
it
were
a
small
seed
of
distress
when
he
reached
the
square
in
front
of
the
theatre
he
was
attracted
by
the
lights
in
the
cafe
tortoni
and
slowly
bent
his
steps
to
the
dazzling
facade
but
just
as
he
was
going
in
he
reflected
that
he
would
meet
friends
there
and
acquaintances
people
he
would
be
obliged
to
talk
to
and
fierce
repugnance
surged
up
in
him
for
this
commonplace
over
coffee
cups
and
liqueur
glasses
so
retracing
his
steps
he
went
back
to
the
leading
to
the
harbour
where
shall
i
go
he
asked
himself
trying
to
think
of
a
spot
he
liked
which
would
agree
with
his
frame
of
mind
he
could
not
think
of
one
for
being
alone
made
him
feel
fractious
yet
he
could
not
bear
to
meet
any
one
as
he
came
out
on
the
grand
quay
he
hesitated
once
more
then
he
turned
towards
the
pier
he
had
chosen
solitude
going
close
by
a
bench
on
the
breakwater
he
sat
down
tired
already
of
walking
and
out
of
humour
with
his
stroll
before
he
had
taken
it
he
said
to
himself
what
is
the
matter
with
me
this
evening
and
he
began
to
search
in
his
memory
for
what
vexation
had
crossed
him
as
we
question
a
sick
man
to
discover
the
cause
of
his
fever
his
mind
was
at
once
irritable
and
sober
he
got
excited
then
he
reasoned
approving
or
blaming
his
impulses
but
in
time
primitive
nature
at
last
proved
the
stronger
the
sensitive
man
always
had
the
upper
hand
over
the
intellectual
man
so
he
tried
to
discover
what
had
induced
this
irascible
mood
this
craving
to
be
moving
without
wanting
anything
this
desire
to
meet
some
one
for
the
sake
of
differing
from
him
and
at
the
same
time
this
aversion
for
the
people
he
might
see
and
the
things
they
might
say
to
him
and
then
he
put
the
question
to
himself
can
it
be
jean
inheritance
yes
it
was
certainly
possible
when
the
lawyer
had
announced
the
news
he
had
felt
his
heart
beat
a
little
faster
for
indeed
one
is
not
always
master
of
one
self
there
are
sudden
and
pertinacious
emotions
against
which
a
man
struggles
in
vain
he
fell
into
meditation
on
the
physiological
problem
of
the
impression
produced
on
the
instinctive
element
in
man
and
giving
rise
to
a
current
of
painful
or
pleasurable
sensations
diametrically
opposed
to
those
which
the
thinking
man
desires
aims
at
and
regards
as
right
and
wholesome
when
he
has
risen
superior
to
himself
by
the
cultivation
of
his
intellect
he
tried
to
picture
to
himself
the
frame
of
mind
of
a
son
who
had
inherited
a
vast
fortune
and
who
thanks
to
that
wealth
may
now
know
many
delights
which
the
avarice
of
his
father
had
prohibited
a
father
nevertheless
beloved
and
regretted
he
got
up
and
walked
on
to
the
end
of
the
pier
he
felt
better
and
glad
to
have
understood
to
have
detected
himself
to
have
unmasked
which
lurks
in
us
then
i
was
jealous
of
jean
thought
he
that
is
really
vilely
mean
and
i
am
sure
of
it
now
for
the
first
idea
which
came
into
my
head
was
that
he
would
marry
mme
rosemilly
and
yet
i
am
not
in
love
myself
with
that
priggish
little
goose
who
is
just
the
woman
to
disgust
a
man
with
good
sense
and
good
conduct
so
it
is
the
most
gratuitous
jealousy
the
very
essence
of
jealousy
which
is
merely
because
it
is
i
must
keep
an
eye
on
that
by
this
time
he
was
in
front
of
the
whence
the
depth
of
water
in
the
harbour
is
signalled
and
he
struck
a
match
to
read
the
list
of
vessels
signalled
in
the
roadstead
and
coming
in
with
the
next
high
tide
ships
were
due
from
brazil
from
la
plata
from
chili
and
japan
two
danish
brigs
a
norwegian
schooner
and
a
turkish
steamship
which
startled
pierre
as
much
as
if
it
had
read
a
swiss
steamship
and
in
a
whimsical
vision
he
pictured
a
great
vessel
crowded
with
men
in
turbans
climbing
the
shrouds
in
loose
trousers
how
absurd
thought
he
but
the
turks
are
a
maritime
people
a
few
steps
further
on
he
stopped
again
looking
out
at
the
roads
on
the
right
above
the
two
electric
lights
of
cape
la
heve
like
monstrous
twin
cyclops
shot
their
long
and
powerful
beams
across
the
sea
starting
from
two
neighbouring
centres
the
two
parallel
shafts
of
light
like
the
colossal
tails
of
two
comets
fell
in
a
straight
and
endless
slope
from
the
top
of
the
cliff
to
the
uttermost
horizon
then
on
the
two
piers
two
more
lights
the
children
of
these
giants
marked
the
entrance
to
the
harbour
and
far
away
on
the
other
side
of
the
seine
others
were
in
sight
many
others
steady
or
winking
flashing
or
revolving
opening
and
shutting
like
eyes
the
eyes
of
the
ports
yellow
red
and
green
watching
the
sea
covered
with
ships
the
living
eyes
of
the
hospitable
shore
saying
merely
by
the
mechanical
and
regular
movement
of
their
i
am
here
i
am
trouville
i
am
honfleur
i
am
the
andemer
and
high
above
all
the
rest
so
high
that
from
this
distance
it
might
be
taken
for
a
planet
the
airy
lighthouse
of
etouville
showed
the
way
to
rouen
across
the
sand
banks
at
the
mouth
of
the
great
river
out
on
the
deep
water
the
limitless
water
darker
than
the
sky
stars
seemed
to
have
fallen
here
and
there
they
twinkled
in
the
night
haze
small
close
to
shore
or
far
away
white
red
and
green
too
most
of
them
were
motionless
some
however
seemed
to
be
scudding
onward
these
were
the
lights
of
the
ships
at
anchor
or
moving
about
in
search
of
moorings
just
at
this
moment
the
moon
rose
behind
the
town
and
it
too
looked
like
some
huge
divine
pharos
lighted
up
in
the
heavens
to
guide
the
countless
fleet
of
stars
in
the
sky
pierre
murmured
almost
speaking
aloud
look
at
that
and
we
let
our
bile
rise
for
twopence
on
a
sudden
close
to
him
in
the
wide
dark
ditch
between
the
two
piers
a
shadow
stole
up
a
large
shadow
of
fantastic
shape
leaning
over
the
granite
parapet
he
saw
that
a
had
glided
in
without
the
sound
of
a
voice
or
the
splash
of
a
ripple
or
the
plunge
of
an
oar
softly
borne
in
by
its
broad
tawny
sail
spread
to
the
breeze
from
the
open
sea
he
thought
to
himself
if
one
could
but
live
on
board
that
boat
what
peace
it
would
be
perhaps
and
then
again
a
few
steps
beyond
he
saw
a
man
sitting
at
the
very
end
of
the
breakwater
a
dreamer
a
lover
a
sage
a
happy
or
a
desperate
man
who
was
it
he
went
forward
curious
to
see
the
face
of
this
lonely
individual
and
he
recognised
his
brother
what
is
it
you
jean
pierre
you
what
has
brought
you
here
i
came
out
to
get
some
fresh
air
and
you
jean
began
to
laugh
i
too
came
out
for
fresh
and
pierre
sat
down
by
his
side
lovely
is
it
oh
yes
he
understood
from
the
tone
of
voice
that
jean
had
not
looked
at
anything
he
went
on
for
my
part
whenever
i
come
here
i
am
seized
with
a
wild
desire
to
be
off
with
all
those
boats
to
the
north
or
the
south
only
to
think
that
all
those
little
sparks
out
there
have
just
come
from
the
uttermost
ends
of
the
earth
from
the
lands
of
great
flowers
and
beautiful
olive
or
copper
coloured
girls
the
lands
of
of
elephants
of
roaming
lions
of
negro
kings
from
all
the
lands
which
are
like
to
us
who
no
longer
believe
in
the
white
cat
or
the
sleeping
beauty
it
would
be
awfully
jolly
to
be
able
to
treat
one
self
to
an
excursion
out
there
but
then
it
would
cost
a
great
deal
of
money
no
end
he
broke
off
abruptly
remembering
that
his
brother
had
that
money
now
and
released
from
care
released
from
labouring
for
his
daily
bread
free
unfettered
happy
and
he
might
go
whither
he
listed
to
find
the
swedes
or
the
brown
damsels
of
havana
and
then
one
of
those
involuntary
flashes
which
were
common
with
him
so
sudden
and
swift
that
he
could
neither
anticipate
them
nor
stop
them
nor
qualify
them
communicated
as
it
seemed
to
him
from
some
second
independent
and
violent
soul
shot
through
his
brain
bah
he
is
too
great
a
simpleton
he
will
marry
that
little
he
was
standing
up
now
i
will
leave
you
to
dream
of
the
future
i
want
to
be
he
grasped
his
brother
hand
and
added
in
a
heavy
tone
well
my
dear
old
boy
you
are
a
rich
man
i
am
very
glad
to
have
come
upon
you
this
evening
to
tell
you
how
pleased
i
am
about
it
how
truly
i
congratulate
you
and
how
much
i
care
for
jean
tender
and
was
deeply
touched
thank
you
my
good
brother
thank
you
he
stammered
and
pierre
turned
away
with
his
slow
step
his
stick
under
his
arm
and
his
hands
behind
his
back
back
in
the
town
again
he
once
more
wondered
what
he
should
do
being
disappointed
of
his
walk
and
deprived
of
the
company
of
the
sea
by
his
brother
presence
he
had
an
inspiration
i
will
go
and
take
a
glass
of
liqueur
with
old
marowsko
and
he
went
off
towards
the
quarter
of
the
town
known
as
ingouville
he
had
known
old
pere
he
called
him
in
the
hospitals
in
paris
he
was
a
pole
an
old
refugee
it
was
said
who
had
gone
through
terrible
things
out
there
and
who
had
come
to
ply
his
calling
as
a
chemist
and
druggist
in
france
after
passing
a
fresh
examination
nothing
was
known
of
his
early
life
and
all
sorts
of
legends
had
been
current
among
the
indoor
and
outdoor
patients
and
afterward
among
his
neighbours
this
reputation
as
a
terrible
conspirator
a
nihilist
a
regicide
a
patriot
ready
for
anything
and
everything
who
had
escaped
death
by
a
miracle
had
bewitched
pierre
roland
lively
and
bold
imagination
he
had
made
friends
with
the
old
pole
without
however
having
ever
extracted
from
him
any
revelation
as
to
his
former
career
it
was
owing
to
the
young
doctor
that
this
worthy
had
come
to
settle
at
havre
counting
on
the
large
custom
which
the
rising
practitioner
would
secure
him
meanwhile
he
lived
very
poorly
in
his
little
shop
selling
medicines
to
the
small
tradesmen
and
workmen
in
his
part
of
the
town
pierre
often
went
to
see
him
and
chat
with
him
for
an
hour
after
dinner
for
he
liked
marowsko
calm
look
and
rare
speech
and
attributed
great
depth
to
his
long
spells
of
silence
a
simple
was
alight
over
the
counter
crowded
with
phials
those
in
the
window
were
not
lighted
from
motives
of
economy
behind
the
counter
sitting
on
a
chair
with
his
legs
stretched
out
and
crossed
an
old
man
quite
bald
with
a
large
beak
of
a
nose
which
as
a
prolongation
of
his
hairless
forehead
gave
him
a
melancholy
likeness
to
a
parrot
was
sleeping
soundly
his
chin
resting
on
his
breast
he
woke
at
the
sound
of
the
and
recognising
the
doctor
came
forward
to
meet
him
holding
out
both
hands
his
black
streaked
with
stains
of
acids
and
sirups
was
much
too
wide
for
his
lean
little
person
and
looked
like
a
shabby
old
cassock
and
the
man
spoke
with
a
strong
polish
accent
which
gave
the
childlike
character
to
his
thin
voice
the
lisping
note
and
intonations
of
a
young
thing
learning
to
speak
pierre
sat
down
and
marowsko
asked
him
what
news
dear
doctor
none
everything
as
usual
you
do
not
look
very
gay
this
i
am
not
often
come
come
you
must
shake
that
off
will
you
try
a
glass
of
liqueur
yes
i
do
not
then
i
will
give
you
something
new
to
try
for
these
two
months
i
have
been
trying
to
extract
something
from
currants
of
which
only
a
sirup
has
been
made
hitherto
well
and
i
have
done
it
i
have
invented
a
very
good
liqueur
very
good
indeed
very
and
quite
delighted
he
went
to
a
cupboard
opened
it
and
picked
out
a
bottle
which
he
brought
forth
he
moved
and
did
everything
in
jerky
gestures
always
incomplete
he
never
quite
stretched
out
his
arm
nor
quite
put
out
his
legs
nor
made
any
broad
and
definite
movements
his
ideas
seemed
to
be
like
his
actions
he
suggested
them
promised
them
sketched
them
hinted
at
them
but
never
fully
uttered
them
and
indeed
his
great
end
in
life
seemed
to
be
the
concoction
of
sirups
and
liqueurs
a
good
sirup
or
a
good
liqueur
is
enough
to
make
a
fortune
he
would
often
say
he
had
compounded
hundreds
of
these
sweet
mixtures
without
ever
succeeding
in
floating
one
of
them
pierre
declared
that
marowsko
always
reminded
him
of
marat
two
little
glasses
were
fetched
out
of
the
back
shop
and
placed
on
the
then
the
two
men
scrutinized
the
colour
of
the
fluid
by
holding
it
up
to
the
gas
a
fine
ruby
pierre
declared
is
it
marowsko
old
beamed
with
satisfaction
the
doctor
tasted
smacked
his
lips
meditated
tasted
again
meditated
again
and
spoke
very
good
capital
and
quite
new
in
flavour
it
is
a
find
my
dear
ah
really
well
i
am
very
then
marowsko
took
counsel
as
to
baptizing
the
new
liqueur
he
wanted
to
call
it
extract
of
currants
or
else
or
or
again
pierre
did
not
approve
of
either
of
these
names
then
the
old
man
had
an
idea
what
you
said
just
now
would
be
very
good
very
good
ruby
but
the
doctor
disputed
the
merit
of
this
name
though
it
had
originated
with
him
he
recommended
simply
groseillette
which
marowsko
thought
admirable
then
they
were
silent
and
sat
for
some
minutes
without
a
word
under
the
solitary
at
last
pierre
began
almost
in
spite
of
himself
a
queer
thing
has
happened
at
home
this
evening
a
friend
of
my
father
who
is
lately
dead
has
left
his
fortune
to
my
the
druggist
did
not
at
first
seem
to
understand
but
after
thinking
it
over
he
hoped
that
the
doctor
had
half
the
inheritance
when
the
matter
was
clearly
explained
to
him
he
appeared
surprised
and
vexed
and
to
express
his
dissatisfaction
at
finding
that
his
young
friend
had
been
sacrificed
he
said
several
times
over
it
will
not
look
pierre
who
was
relapsing
into
nervous
irritation
wanted
to
know
what
marowsko
meant
by
this
phrase
why
would
it
not
look
well
what
was
there
to
look
badly
in
the
fact
that
his
brother
had
come
into
the
money
of
a
friend
of
the
family
but
the
cautious
old
man
would
not
explain
further
in
such
a
case
the
money
is
left
equally
to
the
two
brothers
and
i
tell
you
it
will
not
look
and
the
doctor
out
of
all
patience
went
away
returned
to
his
house
and
went
to
bed
for
some
time
afterward
he
heard
jean
moving
softly
about
the
adjoining
room
and
then
after
drinking
two
glasses
of
water
he
fell
asleep
chapter
iii
the
doctor
awoke
next
morning
firmly
resolved
to
make
his
fortune
several
times
already
he
had
come
to
the
same
determination
without
following
up
the
reality
at
the
outset
of
all
his
trials
of
some
new
career
the
hopes
of
rapidly
acquired
riches
kept
up
his
efforts
and
confidence
till
the
first
obstacle
the
first
check
threw
him
into
a
fresh
path
snug
in
bed
between
the
warm
sheets
he
lay
meditating
how
many
medical
men
had
become
wealthy
in
quite
a
short
time
all
that
was
needed
was
a
little
knowledge
of
the
world
for
in
the
course
of
his
studies
he
had
learned
to
estimate
the
most
famous
physicians
and
he
judged
them
all
to
be
asses
he
was
certainly
as
good
as
they
if
not
better
if
by
any
means
he
could
secure
a
practice
among
the
wealth
and
fashion
of
havre
he
could
easily
make
a
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
and
he
calculated
with
great
exactitude
what
his
certain
profits
must
be
he
would
go
out
in
the
morning
to
visit
his
patients
at
the
very
moderate
average
of
ten
a
day
at
twenty
francs
each
that
would
mount
up
to
thousand
francs
a
year
at
least
or
even
thousand
for
ten
patients
was
certainly
below
the
mark
in
the
afternoon
he
would
be
at
home
to
say
another
ten
patients
at
ten
francs
each
thousand
francs
here
then
in
round
numbers
was
an
income
of
twenty
thousand
francs
old
patients
or
friends
whom
he
would
charge
only
ten
francs
for
a
visit
or
see
at
home
for
five
would
perhaps
make
a
slight
reduction
on
this
sum
total
but
consultations
with
other
physicians
and
various
incidental
fees
would
make
up
for
that
nothing
could
be
easier
than
to
achieve
this
by
skilful
advertising
remarks
in
the
figaro
to
the
effect
that
the
scientific
faculty
of
paris
had
their
eye
on
him
and
were
interested
in
the
cures
effected
by
the
modest
young
practitioner
of
havre
and
he
would
be
richer
than
his
brother
richer
and
more
famous
and
satisfied
with
himself
for
he
would
owe
his
fortune
solely
to
his
own
exertions
and
liberal
to
his
old
parents
who
would
be
justly
proud
of
his
fame
he
would
not
marry
would
not
burden
his
life
with
a
wife
who
would
be
in
his
way
but
he
would
choose
his
mistress
from
the
most
beautiful
of
his
patients
he
felt
so
sure
of
success
that
he
sprang
out
of
bed
as
though
to
grasp
it
on
the
spot
and
he
dressed
to
go
and
search
through
the
town
for
rooms
to
suit
him
then
as
he
wandered
about
the
streets
he
reflected
how
slight
are
the
causes
which
determine
our
actions
any
time
these
three
weeks
he
might
and
ought
to
have
come
to
this
decision
which
beyond
a
doubt
the
news
of
his
brother
inheritance
had
abruptly
given
rise
to
he
stopped
before
every
door
where
a
placard
proclaimed
that
fine
apartments
or
handsome
rooms
were
to
be
let
announcements
without
an
adjective
he
turned
from
with
scorn
then
he
inspected
them
with
a
lofty
air
measuring
the
height
of
the
rooms
sketching
the
plan
in
his
with
the
passages
the
arrangement
of
the
exits
explaining
that
he
was
a
medical
man
and
had
many
visitors
he
must
have
a
broad
and
nor
could
he
be
any
higher
up
than
the
first
floor
after
having
written
down
seven
or
eight
addresses
and
scribbled
two
hundred
notes
he
got
home
to
breakfast
a
quarter
of
an
hour
too
late
in
the
hall
he
heard
the
clatter
of
plates
then
they
had
begun
without
him
why
they
were
never
wont
to
be
so
punctual
he
was
nettled
and
put
out
for
he
was
somewhat
as
he
went
in
roland
said
to
him
come
pierre
make
haste
devil
take
you
you
know
we
have
to
be
at
the
lawyer
at
two
this
is
not
the
day
to
be
pierre
sat
down
without
replying
after
kissing
his
mother
and
shaking
hands
with
his
father
and
brother
and
he
helped
himself
from
the
deep
dish
in
the
middle
of
the
table
to
the
cutlet
which
had
been
kept
for
him
it
was
cold
and
dry
probably
the
least
tempting
of
them
all
he
thought
that
they
might
have
left
it
on
the
hot
plate
till
he
came
in
and
not
lose
their
heads
so
completely
as
to
have
forgotten
their
other
son
their
eldest
the
conversation
which
his
entrance
had
interrupted
was
taken
up
again
at
the
point
where
it
had
ceased
in
your
place
mme
roland
was
saying
to
jean
i
will
tell
you
what
i
should
do
at
once
i
should
settle
in
handsome
rooms
so
as
to
attract
attention
i
should
ride
on
horseback
and
select
one
or
two
interesting
cases
to
defend
and
make
a
mark
in
court
i
would
be
a
sort
of
amateur
lawyer
and
very
select
thank
god
you
are
out
of
all
danger
of
want
and
if
you
pursue
a
profession
it
is
after
all
only
that
you
may
not
lose
the
benefit
of
your
studies
and
because
a
man
ought
never
to
sit
old
roland
who
was
peeling
a
pear
exclaimed
christi
in
your
place
i
should
buy
a
nice
yacht
a
cutter
on
the
build
of
our
i
would
sail
as
far
as
senegal
in
such
a
boat
as
pierre
in
his
turn
spoke
his
views
after
all
said
he
it
was
not
his
wealth
which
made
the
moral
worth
the
intellectual
worth
of
a
man
to
a
man
of
inferior
mind
it
was
only
a
means
of
degradation
while
in
the
hands
of
a
strong
man
it
was
a
powerful
lever
they
to
be
sure
were
rare
if
jean
were
a
really
superior
man
now
that
he
could
never
want
he
might
prove
it
but
then
he
must
work
a
hundred
times
harder
than
he
would
have
done
in
other
circumstances
his
business
now
must
be
not
to
argue
for
or
against
the
widow
and
the
orphan
and
pocket
his
fees
for
every
case
he
gained
but
to
become
a
really
eminent
legal
authority
a
luminary
of
the
law
and
he
added
in
conclusion
if
i
were
rich
would
i
dissect
no
end
of
bodies
father
roland
shrugged
his
shoulders
that
is
all
very
fine
he
said
but
the
wisest
way
of
life
is
to
take
it
easy
we
are
not
beasts
of
burden
but
men
if
you
are
born
poor
you
must
work
well
so
much
the
worse
and
you
do
work
but
where
you
have
dividends
you
must
be
a
flat
if
you
grind
yourself
to
pierre
replied
haughtily
our
notions
differ
for
my
part
i
respect
nothing
on
earth
but
learning
and
intellect
everything
else
is
beneath
mme
roland
always
tried
to
deaden
the
constant
shocks
between
father
and
son
she
turned
the
conversation
and
began
talking
of
a
murder
committed
the
week
before
at
bolbec
nointot
their
minds
were
immediately
full
of
the
circumstances
under
which
the
crime
had
been
committed
and
absorbed
by
the
interesting
horror
the
attractive
mystery
of
crime
which
however
commonplace
shameful
and
disgusting
exercises
a
strange
and
universal
fascination
over
the
curiosity
of
mankind
now
and
again
however
old
roland
looked
at
his
watch
come
said
he
it
is
time
to
be
pierre
sneered
it
is
not
yet
one
he
said
it
really
was
hardly
worth
while
to
condemn
me
to
eat
a
cold
are
you
coming
to
the
lawyer
his
mother
asked
i
no
what
for
he
replied
dryly
my
presence
is
quite
jean
sat
silent
as
though
he
had
no
concern
in
the
matter
when
they
were
discussing
the
murder
at
bolbec
he
as
a
legal
authority
had
put
forward
some
opinions
and
uttered
some
reflections
on
crime
and
criminals
now
he
spoke
no
more
but
the
sparkle
in
his
eye
the
bright
colour
in
his
cheeks
the
very
gloss
of
his
beard
seemed
to
proclaim
his
happiness
when
the
family
had
gone
pierre
alone
once
more
resumed
his
investigations
in
the
apartments
to
let
after
two
or
three
hours
spent
in
going
up
and
down
stairs
he
at
last
found
in
the
boulevard
francois
a
pretty
set
of
rooms
a
spacious
entresol
with
two
doors
on
two
different
streets
two
a
glass
corridor
where
his
patients
while
they
waited
might
walk
among
flowers
and
a
delightful
with
a
looking
out
over
the
sea
when
it
came
to
taking
it
the
terms
three
thousand
francs
pulled
him
up
the
first
quarter
must
be
paid
in
advance
and
he
had
nothing
not
a
penny
to
call
his
own
the
little
fortune
his
father
had
saved
brought
him
in
about
eight
thousand
francs
a
year
and
pierre
had
often
blamed
himself
for
having
placed
his
parents
in
difficulties
by
his
long
delay
in
deciding
on
a
profession
by
forfeiting
his
attempts
and
beginning
fresh
courses
of
study
so
he
went
away
promising
to
send
his
answer
within
two
days
and
it
occurred
to
him
to
ask
jean
to
lend
him
the
amount
of
this
quarter
rent
or
even
of
a
fifteen
hundred
francs
as
soon
as
jean
should
have
come
into
possession
it
will
be
a
loan
for
a
few
months
at
most
he
thought
i
shall
repay
him
very
likely
before
the
end
of
the
year
it
is
a
simple
matter
and
he
will
be
glad
to
do
so
much
for
as
it
was
not
yet
four
and
he
had
nothing
to
do
absolutely
nothing
he
went
to
sit
in
the
public
gardens
and
he
remained
a
long
time
on
a
bench
without
an
idea
in
his
brain
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
crushed
by
weariness
amounting
to
distress
and
yet
this
was
how
he
had
been
living
all
these
days
since
his
return
home
without
suffering
so
acutely
from
the
vacuity
of
his
existence
and
from
inaction
how
had
he
spent
his
time
from
rising
in
the
morning
till
he
had
loafed
on
the
pier
at
high
tide
loafed
in
the
streets
loafed
in
the
cafes
loafed
at
marowsko
loafed
everywhere
and
on
a
sudden
this
life
which
he
had
endured
till
now
had
become
odious
intolerable
if
he
had
had
any
he
would
have
taken
a
carriage
for
a
long
drive
in
the
country
along
by
the
shaded
by
beech
and
elm
trees
but
he
had
to
think
twice
of
the
cost
of
a
glass
of
beer
or
a
and
such
an
indulgence
was
out
of
his
ken
it
suddenly
struck
him
how
hard
it
was
for
a
man
of
past
thirty
to
be
reduced
to
ask
his
mother
with
a
blush
for
a
piece
every
now
and
then
and
he
muttered
as
he
scored
the
gravel
with
the
ferule
of
his
stick
christi
if
i
only
had
money
and
again
the
thought
of
his
brother
legacy
came
into
his
head
like
the
sting
of
a
wasp
but
he
drove
it
out
indignantly
not
choosing
to
allow
himself
to
slip
down
that
descent
to
jealousy
some
children
were
playing
about
in
the
dusty
paths
they
were
fair
little
things
with
long
hair
and
they
were
making
little
mounds
of
sand
with
the
greatest
gravity
and
careful
attention
to
crush
them
at
once
by
stamping
on
them
it
was
one
of
those
gloomy
days
with
pierre
when
we
pry
into
every
corner
of
our
souls
and
shake
out
every
crease
all
our
endeavours
are
like
the
labours
of
those
babies
thought
he
and
then
he
wondered
whether
the
wisest
thing
in
life
were
not
to
beget
two
or
three
of
these
little
creatures
and
watch
them
grow
up
with
complacent
curiosity
a
longing
for
marriage
breathed
on
his
soul
a
man
is
not
so
lost
when
he
is
not
alone
at
any
rate
he
has
some
one
stirring
at
his
side
in
hours
of
trouble
or
of
uncertainty
and
it
is
something
only
to
be
able
to
speak
on
equal
terms
to
a
woman
when
one
is
suffering
then
he
began
thinking
of
women
he
knew
very
little
of
them
never
having
had
any
but
very
transient
connections
as
a
medical
student
broken
off
as
soon
as
the
month
allowance
was
spent
and
renewed
or
replaced
by
another
the
following
month
and
yet
there
must
be
some
very
kind
gentle
and
comforting
creatures
among
them
had
not
his
mother
been
the
good
sense
and
saving
grace
of
his
own
home
how
glad
he
would
be
to
know
a
woman
a
true
woman
he
started
up
with
a
sudden
determination
to
go
and
call
on
mme
rosemilly
but
he
promptly
sat
down
again
he
did
not
like
that
woman
why
not
she
had
too
much
vulgar
and
sordid
common
sense
besides
did
she
not
seem
to
prefer
jean
without
confessing
it
to
himself
too
bluntly
this
preference
had
a
great
deal
to
do
with
his
low
opinion
of
the
widow
intellect
for
though
he
loved
his
brother
he
could
not
help
thinking
him
somewhat
mediocre
and
believing
himself
the
superior
however
he
was
not
going
to
sit
there
till
nightfall
and
as
he
had
done
on
the
previous
evening
he
anxiously
asked
himself
what
am
i
going
to
do
at
this
moment
he
felt
in
his
soul
the
need
of
a
melting
mood
of
being
embraced
and
comforted
comforted
for
what
he
could
not
have
put
it
into
words
but
he
was
in
one
of
these
hours
of
weakness
and
exhaustion
when
a
woman
presence
a
woman
kiss
the
touch
of
a
hand
the
rustle
of
a
petticoat
a
soft
look
out
of
black
or
blue
eyes
seem
the
one
thing
needful
there
and
then
to
our
heart
and
the
memory
flashed
upon
him
of
a
little
barmaid
at
a
whom
he
had
walked
home
with
one
evening
and
seen
again
from
time
to
time
so
once
more
he
rose
to
go
and
drink
a
bock
with
the
girl
what
should
he
say
to
her
what
would
she
say
to
him
nothing
probably
but
what
did
that
matter
he
would
hold
her
hand
for
a
few
seconds
she
seemed
to
have
a
fancy
for
him
why
then
did
he
not
go
to
see
her
oftener
he
found
her
dozing
on
a
chair
in
the
which
was
almost
deserted
three
men
were
drinking
and
smoking
with
their
elbows
on
the
oak
tables
the
in
her
desk
was
reading
a
novel
while
the
master
in
his
lay
sound
asleep
on
a
bench
as
soon
as
she
saw
him
the
girl
rose
eagerly
and
coming
to
meet
him
said
monsieur
how
are
you
pretty
well
and
you
i
oh
very
well
how
scarce
you
make
yourself
yes
i
have
very
little
time
to
myself
i
am
a
doctor
you
indeed
you
never
told
me
if
i
had
known
that
i
was
out
of
sorts
last
week
and
i
would
have
sent
for
you
what
will
you
take
a
bock
and
you
i
will
have
a
bock
too
since
you
are
willing
to
treat
she
had
addressed
him
with
the
familiar
and
continued
to
use
it
as
if
the
offer
of
a
drink
had
tacitly
conveyed
permission
then
sitting
down
opposite
each
other
they
talked
for
a
while
every
now
and
then
she
took
his
hand
with
the
light
familiarity
of
girls
whose
kisses
are
for
sale
and
looking
at
him
with
inviting
eyes
she
said
why
do
you
come
here
oftener
i
like
you
very
much
he
was
already
disgusted
with
her
he
saw
how
stupid
she
was
and
common
smacking
of
low
life
a
woman
he
told
himself
should
appear
to
us
in
dreams
or
such
a
glory
as
may
poetize
her
vulgarity
next
she
asked
him
you
went
by
the
other
morning
with
a
handsome
fair
man
wearing
a
big
beard
is
he
your
brother
yes
he
is
my
awfully
do
you
think
so
yes
indeed
and
he
looks
like
a
man
who
enjoys
life
what
strange
craving
impelled
him
on
a
sudden
to
tell
this
about
jean
legacy
why
should
this
thing
which
he
kept
at
length
when
he
was
alone
which
he
drove
from
him
for
fear
of
the
torment
it
brought
upon
his
soul
rise
to
his
lips
at
this
moment
and
why
did
he
allow
it
to
overflow
them
as
if
he
needed
once
more
to
empty
out
his
heart
to
some
one
gorged
as
it
was
with
bitterness
he
crossed
his
legs
and
said
he
has
wonderful
luck
that
brother
of
mine
he
had
just
come
into
a
legacy
of
twenty
thousand
francs
a
she
opened
those
covetous
blue
eyes
of
hers
very
wide
oh
and
who
left
him
that
his
grandmother
or
his
aunt
no
an
old
friend
of
my
only
a
friend
impossible
and
you
did
he
leave
you
nothing
no
i
knew
him
very
she
sat
thinking
some
minutes
then
with
an
odd
smile
on
her
lips
she
said
well
he
is
a
lucky
dog
that
brother
of
yours
to
have
friends
of
this
pattern
my
word
and
no
wonder
he
is
so
unlike
he
longed
to
slap
her
without
knowing
why
and
he
asked
with
pinched
lips
and
what
do
you
mean
by
saying
that
she
had
put
on
a
stolid
innocent
face
o
h
nothing
i
mean
he
has
better
luck
than
he
tossed
a
franc
piece
on
the
table
and
went
out
now
he
kept
repeating
the
phrase
no
wonder
he
is
so
unlike
what
had
her
thought
been
what
had
been
her
meaning
under
those
words
there
was
certainly
some
malice
some
spite
something
shameful
in
it
yes
that
hussy
must
have
fancied
no
doubt
that
jean
was
son
the
agitation
which
came
over
him
at
the
notion
of
this
suspicion
cast
at
his
mother
was
so
violent
that
he
stood
still
looking
about
him
for
some
place
where
he
might
sit
down
in
front
of
him
was
another
cafe
he
went
in
took
a
chair
and
as
the
waiter
came
up
a
bock
he
said
he
felt
his
heart
beating
his
skin
was
gooseflesh
and
then
the
recollection
flashed
upon
him
of
what
marowsko
had
said
the
evening
before
it
will
not
look
had
he
had
the
same
thought
the
same
suspicion
as
this
baggage
hanging
his
head
over
the
glass
he
watched
the
white
froth
as
the
bubbles
rose
and
burst
asking
himself
is
it
possible
that
such
a
thing
should
be
believed
but
the
reasons
which
might
give
rise
to
this
horrible
doubt
in
other
men
minds
now
struck
him
one
after
another
as
plain
obvious
and
exasperating
that
a
childless
old
bachelor
should
leave
his
fortune
to
a
friend
two
sons
was
the
most
simple
and
natural
thing
in
the
world
but
that
he
should
leave
the
whole
of
it
to
one
alone
of
course
people
would
wonder
and
whisper
and
end
by
smiling
how
was
it
that
he
had
not
foreseen
this
that
his
father
had
not
felt
it
how
was
it
that
his
mother
had
not
guessed
it
no
they
had
been
too
delighted
at
this
wealth
for
the
idea
to
come
near
them
and
besides
how
should
these
worthy
souls
have
ever
dreamed
of
anything
so
ignominious
but
the
public
their
neighbours
the
shopkeepers
their
own
tradesmen
all
who
knew
them
would
not
they
repeat
the
abominable
thing
laugh
at
it
enjoy
it
make
game
of
his
father
and
despise
his
mother
and
the
barmaid
remark
that
jean
was
fair
and
he
dark
that
they
were
not
in
the
least
alike
in
face
manner
figure
or
intelligence
would
now
strike
every
eye
and
every
mind
when
any
one
spoke
of
roland
son
the
question
would
be
which
the
real
or
the
false
he
rose
firmly
resolved
to
warn
jean
and
put
him
on
his
guard
against
the
frightful
danger
which
threatened
their
mother
honour
but
what
could
jean
do
the
simplest
thing
no
doubt
would
be
to
refuse
the
inheritance
which
would
then
go
to
the
poor
and
to
tell
all
friends
or
acquaintances
who
had
heard
of
the
bequest
that
the
will
contained
clauses
and
conditions
impossible
to
subscribe
to
which
would
have
made
jean
not
inheritor
but
merely
a
trustee
as
he
made
his
way
home
he
was
thinking
that
he
must
see
his
brother
alone
so
as
not
to
speak
of
such
a
matter
in
the
presence
of
his
parents
on
reaching
the
door
he
heard
a
great
noise
of
voices
and
laughter
in
the
and
when
he
went
in
he
found
captain
beausire
and
mme
rosemilly
whom
his
father
had
brought
home
and
engaged
to
dine
with
them
in
honour
of
the
good
news
vermouth
and
absinthe
had
been
served
to
whet
their
appetites
and
every
one
had
been
at
once
put
into
good
spirits
captain
beausire
a
funny
little
man
who
had
become
quite
round
by
dint
of
being
rolled
about
at
sea
and
whose
ideas
also
seemed
to
have
been
worn
round
like
the
pebbles
of
a
beach
while
he
laughed
with
his
throat
full
of
looked
upon
life
as
a
capital
thing
in
which
everything
that
might
turn
up
was
good
to
take
he
clinked
his
glass
against
father
roland
while
jean
was
offering
two
freshly
filled
glasses
to
the
ladies
mme
rosemilly
refused
till
captain
beausire
who
had
known
her
husband
cried
come
come
madame
repetita
as
we
say
in
the
lingo
which
is
as
much
as
to
say
two
glasses
of
vermouth
never
hurt
any
one
look
at
me
since
i
have
left
the
sea
in
this
way
i
give
myself
an
artificial
roll
or
two
every
day
before
dinner
i
add
a
little
pitching
after
my
coffee
and
that
keeps
things
lively
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
i
never
rise
to
a
hurricane
mind
you
never
never
i
am
too
much
afraid
of
roland
whose
nautical
mania
was
humoured
by
the
old
mariner
laughed
heartily
his
face
flushed
already
and
his
eye
watery
from
the
absinthe
he
had
a
burly
stomach
nothing
but
stomach
in
which
the
rest
of
his
body
seemed
to
have
got
stowed
away
the
flabby
paunch
of
men
who
spend
their
lives
sitting
and
who
have
neither
thighs
nor
chest
nor
arms
nor
neck
the
seat
of
their
chairs

accumulated
all
their
substance
in
one
spot

the
contrary

short
and
stout

as
tight
as

hard

mme
roland
had
not
emptied
her
glass
and
was
gazing
at
her
son
jean
with
sparkling
eyes
happiness
had
brought
a
colour
to
her
cheeks
in
him
too
the
fulness
of
joy
had
now
blazed
out
it
was
a
settled
thing
signed
and
sealed
he
had
twenty
thousand
francs
a
year
in
the
sound
of
his
laugh
in
the
fuller
voice
with
which
he
spoke
in
his
way
of
looking
at
the
others
his
more
positive
manners
his
greater
confidence
the
assurance
given
by
money
was
at
once
perceptible
dinner
was
announced
and
as
the
old
man
was
about
to
offer
his
arm
to
mme
rosemilly
his
wife
exclaimed
no
no
father
everything
is
for
jean
unwonted
luxury
graced
the
table
in
front
of
jean
who
sat
in
his
father
place
an
enormous
bouquet
of
flowers
a
bouquet
for
a
really
great
occasion
stood
up
like
a
cupola
dressed
with
flags
and
was
flanked
by
four
high
dishes
one
containing
a
pyramid
of
splendid
peaches
the
second
a
monumental
cake
gorged
with
whipped
cream
and
covered
with
pinnacles
of
sugar
a
cathedral
in
confectionery
the
third
slices
of
floating
in
clear
sirup
and
the
fourth
lavishness
black
grapes
brought
from
the
warmer
south
the
devil
exclaimed
pierre
as
he
sat
down
we
are
celebrating
the
accession
of
jean
the
after
the
soup
madeira
was
passed
round
and
already
every
one
was
talking
at
once
beausire
was
giving
the
history
of
a
dinner
he
had
eaten
at
san
domingo
at
the
table
of
a
negro
general
old
roland
was
listening
and
at
the
same
time
trying
to
get
in
between
the
sentences
his
account
of
another
dinner
given
by
a
friend
of
his
at
mendon
after
which
every
guest
was
ill
for
a
fortnight
mme
rosemilly
jean
and
his
mother
were
planning
an
excursion
to
breakfast
at
saint
jouin
from
which
they
promised
themselves
the
greatest
pleasure
and
pierre
was
only
sorry
that
he
had
not
dined
alone
in
some
by
the
sea
so
as
to
escape
all
this
noise
and
laughter
and
glee
which
fretted
him
he
was
wondering
how
he
could
now
set
to
work
to
confide
his
fears
to
his
brother
and
induce
him
to
renounce
the
fortune
he
had
already
accepted
and
of
which
he
was
enjoying
the
intoxicating
foretaste
it
would
be
hard
on
him
no
doubt
but
it
must
be
done
he
could
not
hesitate
their

reputation
was
at
stake
the
appearance
of
an
enormous
threw
roland
back
on
fishing
stories
beausire
told
some
wonderful
tales
of
adventure
on
the
gaboon
at
in
madagascar
and
above
all
off
the
coasts
of
china
and
japan
where
the
fish
are
as
as
the
natives
and
he
described
the
appearance
of
these
fishes
their
goggle
gold
eyes
their
blue
or
red
bellies
their
fantastic
fins
like
fans
their
eccentric
tails
with
such
droll
gesticulation
that
they
all
laughed
till
they
cried
as
they
listened

alone
seemed
incredulous
muttering
to
himself
true
enough

the
gascons
of

roast

helped
to
wait
on
them
and
the
fun
rose
with
the
number
of
glasses
of
wine
they
drank
when
the
cork
of
the
first
was
drawn
with
a
pop
father
roland
highly
excited
imitated
the
noise
with
his
tongue
and
then
declared
i
like
that
noise
better
than
a
pierre
more
and
more
fractious
every
moment
retorted
with
a
sneer
and
yet
it
is
perhaps
a
greater
danger
for
roland
who
was
on
the
point
of
drinking
set
his
full
glass
down
on
the
table
again
and
asked
why
he
had
for
some
time
been
complaining
of
his
health
of
heaviness
giddiness
frequent
and
unaccountable
discomfort
the
doctor
replied
because
the
bullet
might
very
possibly
miss
you
while
the
glass
of
wine
is
dead
certain
to
hit
you
in
the
and
what
then
then
it
scorches
your
inside
upsets
your
nervous
system
makes
the
circulation
sluggish
and
leads
the
way
to
the
apoplectic
fit
which
always
threatens
a
man
of
your
the
jeweller
incipient
intoxication
had
vanished
like
smoke
before
the
wind
he
looked
at
his
son
with
fixed
uneasy
eyes
trying
to
discover
whether
he
was
making
game
of
him
but
beausire
exclaimed
oh
these
confounded
doctors
they
all
sing
the
same
tune
eat
nothing
drink
nothing
never
make
love
or
enjoy
yourself
it
all
plays
the
devil
with
your
precious
health
well
all
i
can
say
is
i
have
done
all
these
things
sir
in
every
quarter
of
the
globe
wherever
and
as
often
as
i
have
had
the
chance
and
i
am
none
the
pierre
answered
with
some
asperity
in
the
first
place
captain
you
are
a
stronger
man
than
my
father
and
in
the
next
all
free
livers
talk
as
you
do
till
the
day
when
when
they
come
back
no
more
to
say
to
the
cautious
doctor
were
right
when
i
see
my
father
doing
what
is
worst
and
most
dangerous
for
him
it
is
but
natural
that
i
should
warn
him
i
should
be
a
bad
son
if
i
did
mme
roland
much
distressed
now
put
in
her
word
come
pierre
what
ails
you
for
once
it
can
not
hurt
him
think
of
what
an
occasion
it
is
for
him
for
all
of
us
you
will
spoil
his
pleasure
and
make
us
all
unhappy
it
is
too
bad
of
you
to
do
such
a
he
muttered
as
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
can
do
as
he
pleases
i
have
warned
but
father
roland
did
not
drink
he
sat
looking
at
his
glass
full
of
the
clear
and
luminous
liquor
while
its
light
soul
its
intoxicating
soul
flew
off
in
tiny
bubbles
mounting
from
its
depths
in
hurried
succession
to
die
on
the
surface
he
looked
at
it
with
the
suspicious
eye
of
a
fox
smelling
at
a
dead
hen
and
suspecting
a
trap
he
asked
doubtfully
do
you
think
it
will
really
do
me
much
harm
pierre
had
a
pang
of
remorse
and
blamed
himself
for
letting
his
punish
the
rest
no
said
he
just
for
once
you
may
drink
it
but
do
not
take
too
much
or
get
into
the
habit
of
then
old
roland
raised
his
glass
but
still
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
put
it
to
his
lips
he
contemplated
it
regretfully
with
longing
and
with
fear
then
he
smelt
it
tasted
it
drank
it
in
sips
swallowing
them
slowly
his
heart
full
of
terrors
of
weakness
and
greediness
and
then
when
he
had
drained
the
last
drop
of
regret
pierre
eye
suddenly
met
that
of
mme
rosemilly
it
rested
on
him
clear
and
blue
and
hard
and
he
read
he
knew
the
precise
thought
which
lurked
in
that
look
the
indignant
thought
of
this
simple
and
little
woman
for
the
look
said
you
are
jealous
that
is
what
you
are
shameful
he
bent
his
head
and
went
on
with
his
dinner
he
was
not
hungry
and
found
nothing
nice
a
longing
to
be
off
harassed
him
a
craving
to
be
away
from
these
people
to
hear
no
more
of
their
talking
jests
and
laughter
father
roland
meanwhile
to
whose
head
the
fumes
of
the
wine
were
rising
once
more
had
already
forgotten
his
son
advice
and
was
eyeing
a
with
a
tender
leer
as
it
stood
still
nearly
full
by
the
side
of
his
plate
he
dared
not
touch
it
for
fear
of
being
lectured
again
and
he
was
wondering
by
what
device
or
trick
he
could
possess
himself
of
it
without
exciting
pierre
remark
a
ruse
occurred
to
him
the
simplest
possible
he
took
up
the
bottle
with
an
air
of
indifference
and
holding
it
by
the
neck
stretched
his
arm
across
the
table
to
fill
the
doctor
glass
which
was
empty
then
he
filled
up
all
the
other
glasses
and
when
he
came
to
his
own
he
began
talking
very
loud
so
that
if
he
poured
anything
into
it
they
might
have
sworn
it
was
done
inadvertently
and
in
fact
no
one
took
any
notice
pierre
without
observing
it
was
drinking
a
good
deal
nervous
and
fretted
he
every
minute
raised
to
his
lips
the
tall
crystal
funnel
where
the
bubbles
were
dancing
in
the
living
translucent
fluid
he
let
the
wine
slip
very
slowly
over
his
tongue
that
he
might
feel
the
little
sugary
sting
of
the
fixed
air
as
it
evaporated
gradually
a
pleasant
warmth
glowed
in
his
frame
starting
from
the
stomach
as
a
centre
it
spread
to
his
chest
took
possession
of
his
limbs
and
diffused
itself
throughout
his
flesh
like
a
warm
and
comforting
tide
bringing
pleasure
with
it
he
felt
better
now
less
impatient
less
annoyed
and
his
determination
to
speak
to
his
brother
that
very
evening
faded
away
not
that
he
thought
for
a
moment
of
giving
it
up
but
simply
not
to
disturb
the
happy
mood
in
which
he
found
himself
beausire
presently
rose
to
propose
a
toast
having
bowed
to
the
company
he
began
most
gracious
ladies
and
gentlemen
we
have
met
to
do
honour
to
a
happy
event
which
has
befallen
one
of
our
friends
it
used
to
be
said
that
fortune
was
blind
but
i
believe
that
she
is
only
or
tricksy
and
that
she
has
lately
bought
a
good
pair
of
glasses
which
enabled
her
to
discover
in
the
town
of
havre
the
son
of
our
worthy
friend
roland
skipper
of
the
every
one
cried
bravo
and
clapped
their
hands
and
the
elder
roland
rose
to
reply
after
clearing
his
throat
for
it
felt
thick
and
his
tongue
was
heavy
he
stammered
out
thank
you
captain
thank
you
for
myself
and
my
son
i
shall
never
forget
your
behaviour
on
this
occasion
here
good
luck
to
you
his
eyes
and
nose
were
full
of
tears
and
he
sat
down
finding
nothing
more
to
say
jean
who
was
laughing
spoke
in
his
turn
it
is
i
said
he
who
ought
to
thank
my
friends
here
my
excellent
friends
and
he
glanced
at
mme
rosemilly
who
have
given
me
such
a
touching
evidence
of
their
affection
but
it
is
not
by
words
that
i
can
prove
my
gratitude
i
will
prove
it
every
hour
of
my
life
always
for
our
friendship
is
not
one
of
those
which
fade
his
mother
deeply
moved
murmured
well
said
my
but
beausire
cried
out
come
mme
rosemilly
speak
on
behalf
of
the
fair
she
raised
her
glass
and
in
a
pretty
voice
slightly
touched
with
sadness
she
said
i
will
pledge
you
to
the
memory
of
there
was
a
few
moments
lull
a
pause
for
decent
meditation
as
after
prayer
beausire
who
always
had
a
flow
of
compliment
remarked
only
a
woman
ever
thinks
of
these
then
turning
to
father
roland
and
who
was
this
marechal
after
all
you
must
have
been
very
intimate
with
the
old
man
emotional
with
drink
began
to
whimper
and
in
a
broken
voice
he
said
like
a
brother
you
know
such
a
friend
as
one
does
not
make
twice
we
were
always
together
he
dined
with
us
every
evening
and
would
treat
us
to
the
play
i
need
say
no
more
no
more
no
more
a
true
friend
a
real
true
friend
was
he
louise
his
wife
merely
answered
yes
he
was
a
faithful
pierre
looked
at
his
father
and
then
at
his
mother
then
as
the
subject
changed
he
drank
some
more
wine
he
scarcely
remembered
the
remainder
of
the
evening
they
had
coffee
then
liqueurs
and
they
laughed
and
joked
a
great
deal
at
about
midnight
he
went
to
bed
his
mind
confused
and
his
head
heavy
and
he
slept
like
a
brute
till
nine
next
morning
chapter
iv
these
slumbers
lapped
in
champagne
and
chartreuse
had
soothed
and
calmed
him
no
doubt
for
he
awoke
in
a
very
benevolent
frame
of
mind
while
he
was
dressing
he
appraised
weighed
and
summed
up
the
agitations
of
the
past
day
trying
to
bring
out
quite
clearly
and
fully
their
real
and
occult
causes
those
personal
to
himself
as
well
as
those
from
outside
it
was
in
fact
possible
that
the
girl
at
the
had
had
an
evil
suspicion
a
suspicion
worthy
of
such
a
hussy
on
hearing
that
only
one
of
the
roland
brothers
had
been
made
heir
to
a
stranger
but
have
not
such
natures
as
she
always
similar
notions
without
a
shadow
of
foundation
about
every
honest
woman
do
they
not
whenever
they
speak
vilify
calumniate
and
abuse
all
whom
they
believe
to
be
blameless
whenever
a
woman
who
is
above
imputation
is
mentioned
in
their
presence
they
are
as
angry
as
if
they
were
being
insulted
and
exclaim
ah
yes
i
know
your
married
women
a
pretty
sort
they
are
why
they
have
more
lovers
than
we
have
only
they
conceal
it
because
they
are
such
hypocrites
oh
yes
a
pretty
sort
indeed
under
any
other
circumstances
he
would
certainly
not
have
understood
not
have
imagined
the
possibility
of
such
an
insinuation
against
his
poor
mother
who
was
so
kind
so
simple
so
excellent
but
his
spirit
seethed
with
the
leaven
of
jealousy
that
was
fermenting
within
him
his
own
excited
mind
on
the
scent
as
it
were
in
spite
of
himself
for
all
that
could
damage
his
brother
had
even
perhaps
attributed
to
the
tavern
barmaid
an
odious
intention
of
which
she
was
innocent
it
was
possible
that
his
imagination
had
unaided
invented
this
dreadful
doubt
his
imagination
which
he
never
controlled
which
constantly
evaded
his
will
and
went
off
unfettered
audacious
adventurous
and
stealthy
into
the
infinite
world
of
ideas
bringing
back
now
and
then
some
which
were
shameless
and
repulsive
and
which
it
buried
in
him
in
the
depths
of
his
soul
in
its
most
fathomless
recesses
like
something
stolen
his
heart
most
certainly
his
own
heart
had
secrets
from
him
and
had
not
that
wounded
heart
discerned
in
this
atrocious
doubt
a
means
of
depriving
his
brother
of
the
inheritance
of
which
he
was
jealous
he
suspected
himself
now
all
the
mysteries
of
his
mind
as
bigots
search
their
consciences
mme
rosemilly
though
her
intelligence
was
limited
had
certainly
a
woman
instinct
scent
and
subtle
intuitions
and
this
notion
had
never
entered
her
head
since
she
had
with
perfect
simplicity
drunk
to
the
blessed
memory
of
the
deceased
marechal
she
was
not
the
woman
to
have
done
this
if
she
had
had
the
faintest
suspicion
now
he
doubted
no
longer
his
involuntary
displeasure
at
his
brother
windfall
of
fortune
and
his
religious
affection
for
his
mother
had
magnified
his
scruples
very
pious
and
respectable
scruples
but
exaggerated
as
he
put
this
conclusion
into
words
in
his
own
mind
he
felt
happy
as
at
the
doing
of
a
good
action
and
he
resolved
to
be
nice
to
every
one
beginning
with
his
father
whose
manias
and
silly
statements
and
vulgar
opinions
and
too
conspicuous
mediocrity
were
a
constant
irritation
to
him
he
came
in
not
late
for
breakfast
and
amused
all
the
family
by
his
fun
and
good
humour
his
mother
quite
delighted
said
to
him
my
little
pierre
you
have
no
notion
how
humorous
and
clever
you
can
be
when
you
and
he
talked
putting
things
in
a
witty
way
and
making
them
laugh
by
ingenious
hits
at
their
friends
beausire
was
his
butt
and
mme
rosemilly
a
little
but
in
a
very
judicious
way
not
too
spiteful
and
he
thought
as
he
looked
at
his
brother
stand
up
for
her
you
muff
you
may
be
as
rich
as
you
please
i
can
always
eclipse
you
when
i
take
the
as
they
drank
their
coffee
he
said
to
his
father
are
you
going
out
in
the
pearl
no
my
may
i
have
her
with
jean
bart
to
be
sure
as
long
as
you
he
bought
a
good
cigar
at
the
first
tobacconist
and
went
down
to
the
quay
with
a
light
step
he
glanced
up
at
the
sky
which
was
clear
and
luminous
of
a
pale
blue
freshly
swept
by
the
papagris
the
boatman
commonly
called
jean
bart
was
dozing
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
which
he
was
required
to
have
in
readiness
every
day
at
noon
when
they
had
not
been
out
fishing
in
the
morning
you
and
i
together
mate
cried
pierre
he
went
down
the
iron
ladder
of
the
quay
and
leaped
into
the
vessel
which
way
is
the
wind
he
asked
due
east
still
pierre
a
fine
breeze
out
at
well
then
old
man
off
we
go
they
hoisted
the
foresail
and
weighed
anchor
and
the
boat
feeling
herself
free
glided
slowly
down
towards
the
jetty
on
the
still
water
of
the
harbour
the
breath
of
wind
that
came
down
the
streets
caught
the
top
of
the
sail
so
lightly
as
to
be
imperceptible
and
the
pearl
seemed
endowed
with
life
the
life
of
a
vessel
driven
on
by
a
mysterious
latent
power
pierre
took
the
tiller
and
holding
his
cigar
between
his
teeth
he
stretched
his
legs
on
the
bunk
and
with
his
eyes
in
the
blinding
sunshine
he
watched
the
great
tarred
timbers
of
the
breakwater
as
they
glided
past
when
they
reached
the
open
sea
round
the
nose
of
the
north
pier
which
had
sheltered
them
the
fresher
breeze
puffed
in
the
doctor
face
and
on
his
hands
like
a
somewhat
icy
caress
filled
his
chest
which
rose
with
a
long
sigh
to
drink
it
in
and
swelling
the
tawny
sail
tilted
the
pearl
on
her
beam
and
made
her
more
lively
jean
bart
hastily
hauled
up
the
jib
and
the
triangle
of
canvas
full
of
wind
looked
like
a
wing
then
with
two
strides
to
the
stern
he
let
out
the
spinnaker
which
was
against
his
mast
then
along
the
hull
of
the
boat
which
suddenly
heeled
over
and
was
running
at
top
speed
there
was
a
soft
crisp
sound
of
water
hissing
and
rushing
past
the
prow
ripped
up
the
sea
like
the
share
of
a
plough
gone
mad
and
the
yielding
water
it
turned
up
curled
over
and
fell
white
with
foam
as
the
ploughed
soil
heavy
and
brown
rolls
and
falls
in
a
ridge
at
each
wave
they
met
and
there
was
a
short
chopping
sea
the
pearl
shivered
from
the
point
of
the
bowsprit
to
the
rudder
which
trembled
under
pierre
hand
when
the
wind
blew
harder
in
gusts
the
swell
rose
to
the
gunwale
as
if
it
would
overflow
into
the
boat
a
coal
brig
from
liverpool
was
lying
at
anchor
waiting
for
the
tide
they
made
a
sweep
round
her
stern
and
went
to
look
at
each
of
the
vessels
in
the
roads
one
after
another
then
they
put
further
out
to
look
at
the
unfolding
line
of
coast
for
three
hours
pierre
easy
calm
and
happy
wandered
to
and
fro
over
the
dancing
waters
guiding
the
thing
of
wood
and
canvas
which
came
and
went
at
his
will
under
the
pressure
of
his
hand
as
if
it
were
a
swift
and
docile
winged
creature
he
was
lost
in
the
dreams
one
has
on
horseback
or
on
the
deck
of
a
boat
thinking
of
his
future
which
should
be
brilliant
and
the
joys
of
living
intelligently
on
the
morrow
he
would
ask
his
brother
to
lend
him
fifteen
hundred
francs
for
three
months
that
he
might
settle
at
once
in
the
pretty
rooms
on
the
boulevard
francois
suddenly
the
sailor
said
the
fog
is
coming
up
pierre
we
must
go
he
looked
up
and
saw
to
the
northward
a
gray
shade
filmy
but
dense
blotting
out
the
sky
and
covering
the
sea
it
was
sweeping
down
on
them
like
a
cloud
fallen
from
above
he
tacked
for
land
and
made
for
the
pier
scudding
before
the
wind
and
followed
by
the
flying
fog
which
gained
upon
them
when
it
reached
the
pearl
wrapping
her
in
its
intangible
density
a
cold
shudder
ran
over
pierre
limbs
and
a
smell
of
smoke
and
mould
the
peculiar
smell
of
a
made
him
close
his
mouth
that
he
might
not
taste
the
cold
wet
vapour
by
the
time
the
boat
was
at
her
usual
moorings
in
the
harbour
the
whole
town
was
buried
in
this
fine
mist
which
did
not
fall
but
yet
wetted
everything
like
rain
and
glided
and
rolled
along
the
roofs
and
streets
like
the
flow
of
a
river
pierre
with
his
hands
and
feet
frozen
made
haste
home
and
threw
himself
on
his
bed
to
take
a
nap
till
when
he
made
his
appearance
in
the
his
mother
was
saying
to
jean
the
glass
corridor
will
be
lovely
we
will
fill
it
with
flowers
you
will
see
i
will
undertake
to
care
for
them
and
renew
them
when
you
give
a
party
the
effect
will
be
quite
what
in
the
world
are
you
talking
about
the
doctor
asked
of
a
delightful
apartment
i
have
just
taken
for
your
brother
it
is
quite
a
find
an
entresol
looking
out
on
two
streets
there
are
two
a
glass
passage
and
a
little
circular
perfectly
charming
for
a
bachelor
pierre
turned
pale
his
anger
seemed
to
press
on
his
heart
where
is
it
he
asked
boulevard
there
was
no
possibility
for
doubt
he
took
his
seat
in
such
a
state
of
exasperation
that
he
longed
to
exclaim
this
is
really
too
much
is
there
nothing
for
any
one
but
him
his
mother
beaming
went
on
talking
and
only
fancy
i
got
it
for
two
thousand
eight
hundred
francs
a
year
they
asked
three
thousand
but
i
got
a
reduction
of
two
hundred
francs
on
taking
for
three
six
or
nine
years
your
brother
will
be
delightfully
housed
there
an
elegant
home
is
enough
to
make
the
fortune
of
a
lawyer
it
attracts
clients
charms
them
holds
them
fast
commands
respect
and
shows
them
that
a
man
who
lives
in
such
good
style
expects
a
good
price
for
his
she
was
silent
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
went
on
we
must
look
out
for
something
suitable
for
you
much
less
pretentious
since
you
have
nothing
but
nice
and
pretty
all
the
same
i
assure
you
it
will
be
to
your
pierre
replied
contemptuously
for
me
oh
i
shall
make
my
way
by
hard
work
and
but
his
mother
insisted
yes
but
i
assure
you
that
to
be
well
lodged
will
be
of
use
to
you
about
through
the
meal
he
suddenly
asked
how
did
you
first
come
to
know
this
man
marechal
old
roland
looked
up
and
racked
his
memory
wait
a
bit
i
scarcely
recollect
it
is
such
an
old
story
now
ah
yes
i
remember
it
was
your
mother
who
made
the
acquaintance
with
him
in
the
shop
was
it
not
louise
he
first
came
to
order
something
and
then
he
called
frequently
we
knew
him
as
a
customer
before
we
knew
him
as
a
pierre
who
was
eating
beans
sticking
his
fork
into
them
one
by
one
as
if
he
were
spitting
them
went
on
and
when
was
it
that
you
made
his
acquaintance
again
roland
sat
thinking
but
he
could
remember
no
more
and
appealed
to
his
wife
better
memory
in
what
year
was
it
louise
you
surely
have
not
forgotten
you
who
remember
everything
let
me
see
it
was
in
in
in
or
try
to
remember
you
ought
to
know
better
than
she
did
in
fact
think
it
over
for
some
minutes
and
then
replied
in
a
steady
voice
and
with
calm
decision
it
was
in
old
man
pierre
was
three
years
old
i
am
quite
sure
that
i
am
not
mistaken
for
it
was
in
that
year
that
the
child
had
scarlet
fever
and
marechal
whom
we
knew
then
but
very
little
was
of
the
greatest
service
to
roland
exclaimed
to
be
sure
very
true
he
was
really
invaluable
when
your
mother
was
with
fatigue
and
i
had
to
attend
to
the
shop
he
would
go
to
the
chemist
to
fetch
your
medicine
he
really
had
the
kindest
heart
and
when
you
were
well
again
you
can
not
think
how
glad
he
was
and
how
he
petted
you
it
was
from
that
time
that
we
became
such
great
and
this
thought
rushed
into
pierre
soul
as
abrupt
and
violent
as
a
rending
and
piercing
it
since
he
knew
me
first
since
he
was
so
devoted
to
me
since
he
was
so
fond
of
me
and
petted
me
so
much
since
i
was
the
cause
of
his
great
intimacy
with
my
parents
why
did
he
leave
all
his
money
to
my
brother
and
nothing
to
me
he
asked
no
more
questions
and
remained
gloomy
rather
than
thoughtful
feeling
in
his
soul
a
new
anxiety
as
yet
undefined
the
secret
germ
of
a
new
pain
he
went
out
early
wandering
about
the
streets
once
more
they
were
shrouded
in
the
fog
which
made
the
night
heavy
opaque
and
nauseous
it
was
like
a
pestilential
cloud
dropped
on
the
earth
it
could
be
seen
swirling
past
the
which
it
seemed
to
put
out
at
intervals
the
pavement
was
as
slippery
as
on
a
frosty
night
after
rain
and
all
sorts
of
evil
smells
seemed
to
come
up
from
the
bowels
of
the
houses
the
stench
of
cellars
drains
sewers
squalid
kitchens
to
mingle
with
the
horrible
savour
of
this
wandering
fog
pierre
with
his
shoulders
up
and
his
hands
in
his
pockets
not
caring
to
remain
out
of
doors
in
the
cold
turned
into
marowsko
the
druggist
was
asleep
as
usual
under
the
which
kept
watch
on
recognising
pierre
for
whom
he
had
the
affection
of
a
faithful
dog
he
shook
off
his
drowsiness
went
for
two
glasses
and
brought
out
the
well
said
the
doctor
how
is
the
liqueur
getting
on
the
pole
explained
that
four
of
the
chief
cafes
in
the
town
had
agreed
to
have
it
on
sale
and
that
two
papers
the
and
the
would
advertise
it
in
return
for
certain
chemical
preparations
to
be
supplied
to
the
editors
after
a
long
silence
marowsko
asked
whether
jean
had
come
definitely
into
possession
of
his
fortune
and
then
he
put
two
or
three
other
questions
vaguely
referring
to
the
same
subject
his
jealous
devotion
to
pierre
rebelled
against
this
preference
and
pierre
felt
as
though
he
could
hear
him
thinking
he
guessed
and
understood
read
in
his
averted
eyes
and
in
the
hesitancy
of
his
tone
the
words
which
rose
to
his
lips
but
were
not
spoken
which
the
druggist
was
too
timid
or
too
prudent
and
cautious
to
utter
at
this
moment
he
felt
sure
the
old
man
was
thinking
you
ought
not
to
have
suffered
him
to
accept
this
inheritance
which
will
make
people
speak
ill
of
your
perhaps
indeed
marowsko
believed
that
jean
was
marechal
son
of
course
he
believed
it
how
could
he
help
believing
it
when
the
thing
must
seem
so
possible
so
probable
why
he
himself
pierre
her
son
had
not
he
been
for
these
three
days
past
fighting
with
all
the
subtlety
at
his
command
to
cheat
his
reason
fighting
against
this
hideous
suspicion
and
suddenly
the
need
to
be
alone
to
reflect
to
discuss
the
matter
with
himself
to
face
boldly
without
scruple
or
weakness
this
possible
but
monstrous
thing
came
upon
him
anew
and
so
imperative
that
he
rose
without
even
drinking
his
glass
of
shook
hands
with
the
astounded
druggist
and
plunged
out
into
the
foggy
streets
again
he
asked
himself
what
made
this
marechal
leave
all
his
fortune
to
jean
it
was
not
jealousy
now
which
made
him
dwell
on
this
question
not
the
rather
mean
but
natural
envy
which
he
knew
lurked
within
him
and
with
which
he
had
been
struggling
these
three
days
but
the
dread
of
an
overpowering
horror
the
dread
that
he
himself
should
believe
that
jean
his
brother
was
that
man
son
no
he
did
not
believe
it
he
could
not
even
ask
himself
the
question
which
was
a
crime
meanwhile
he
must
get
rid
of
this
faint
suspicion
improbable
as
it
was
utterly
and
forever
he
craved
for
light
for
certainty
he
must
win
absolute
security
in
his
heart
for
he
loved
no
one
in
the
world
but
his
mother
and
as
he
wandered
alone
through
the
darkness
he
would
rack
his
memory
and
his
reason
with
a
minute
search
that
should
bring
out
the
blazing
truth
then
there
would
be
an
end
to
the
matter
he
would
not
think
of
it
again
never
he
would
go
and
sleep
he
argued
thus
let
me
see
first
to
examine
the
facts
then
i
will
recall
all
i
know
about
him
his
behaviour
to
my
brother
and
to
me
i
will
seek
out
the
causes
which
might
have
given
rise
to
the
preference
he
knew
jean
from
his
birth
yes
but
he
had
known
me
first
if
he
had
loved
my
mother
silently
unselfishly
he
would
surely
have
chosen
me
since
it
was
through
me
through
my
scarlet
fever
that
he
became
so
intimate
with
my
parents
logically
then
he
ought
to
have
preferred
me
to
have
had
a
keener
affection
for
me
unless
it
were
that
he
felt
an
instinctive
attraction
and
predilection
for
my
brother
as
he
watched
him
grow
then
with
desperate
tension
of
brain
and
of
all
the
powers
of
his
intellect
he
strove
to
reconstitute
from
memory
the
image
of
this
marechal
to
see
him
to
know
him
to
penetrate
the
man
whom
he
had
seen
pass
by
him
indifferent
to
his
heart
during
all
those
years
in
paris
but
he
perceived
that
the
slight
exertion
of
walking
somewhat
disturbed
his
ideas
dislocated
their
continuity
weakened
their
precision
clouded
his
recollection
to
enable
him
to
look
at
the
past
and
at
unknown
events
with
so
keen
an
eye
that
nothing
should
escape
it
he
must
be
motionless
in
a
vast
and
empty
space
and
he
made
up
his
mind
to
go
and
sit
on
the
jetty
as
he
had
done
that
other
night
as
he
approached
the
harbour
he
heard
out
at
sea
a
lugubrious
and
sinister
wail
like
the
bellowing
of
a
bull
but
more
and
steady
it
was
the
roar
of
a
the
cry
of
a
ship
lost
in
the
fog
a
shiver
ran
through
him
chilling
his
heart
so
deeply
did
this
cry
of
distress
thrill
his
soul
and
nerves
that
he
felt
as
if
he
had
uttered
it
himself
another
and
a
similar
voice
answered
with
such
another
moan
but
farther
away
then
close
by
the
on
the
pier
gave
out
a
fearful
sound
in
answer
pierre
made
for
the
jetty
with
long
steps
thinking
no
more
of
anything
content
to
walk
on
into
this
ominous
and
bellowing
darkness
when
he
had
seated
himself
at
the
end
of
the
breakwater
he
closed
his
eyes
that
he
might
not
see
the
two
electric
lights
now
blurred
by
the
fog
which
make
the
harbour
accessible
at
night
and
the
red
glare
of
the
light
on
the
south
pier
which
was
however
scarcely
visible
turning
he
rested
his
elbows
on
the
granite
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
though
he
did
not
pronounce
the
words
with
his
lips
his
mind
kept
repeating
marechal
marechal
as
if
to
raise
and
challenge
the
shade
and
on
the
black
background
of
his
closed
eyelids
he
suddenly
saw
him
as
he
had
known
him
a
man
of
about
sixty
with
a
white
beard
cut
in
a
point
and
very
thick
eyebrows
also
white
he
was
neither
tall
nor
short
his
manner
was
pleasant
his
eyes
gray
and
soft
his
movements
gentle
his
whole
appearance
that
of
a
good
fellow
simple
and
kindly
he
called
pierre
and
jean
my
dear
children
and
had
never
seemed
to
prefer
either
asking
them
both
together
to
dine
with
him
and
then
pierre
with
the
pertinacity
of
a
dog
seeking
a
lost
scent
tried
to
recall
the
words
gestures
tones
looks
of
this
man
who
had
vanished
from
the
world
by
degrees
he
saw
him
quite
clearly
in
his
rooms
in
the
rue
tronchet
where
he
received
his
brother
and
himself
at
dinner
he
was
waited
on
by
two
maids
both
old
women
who
had
been
in
the
habit
a
very
old
one
no
doubt
of
saying
monsieur
pierre
and
monsieur
marechal
would
hold
out
both
hands
the
right
hand
to
one
of
the
young
men
the
left
to
the
other
as
they
happened
to
come
in
how
are
you
my
children
he
would
say
have
you
any
news
of
your
parents
as
for
me
they
never
write
to
the
talk
was
quiet
and
intimate
of
commonplace
matters
there
was
nothing
remarkable
in
the
man
mind
but
much
that
was
winning
charming
and
gracious
he
had
certainly
been
a
good
friend
to
them
one
of
those
good
friends
of
whom
we
think
the
less
because
we
feel
sure
of
them
now
reminiscences
came
readily
to
pierre
mind
having
seen
him
anxious
from
time
to
time
and
suspecting
his
student
impecuniousness
marechal
had
of
his
own
accord
offered
and
lent
him
money
a
few
hundred
francs
perhaps
forgotten
by
both
and
never
repaid
then
this
man
must
always
have
been
fond
of
him
always
have
taken
an
interest
in
him
since
he
thought
of
his
needs
well
then
well
then
why
leave
his
whole
fortune
to
jean
no
he
had
never
shown
more
marked
affection
for
the
younger
than
for
the
elder
had
never
been
more
interested
in
one
than
in
the
other
or
seemed
to
care
more
tenderly
for
this
one
or
that
one
well
then
well
then
he
must
have
had
some
strong
secret
reason
for
leaving
everything
to
jean
everything
and
nothing
to
pierre
the
more
he
thought
the
more
he
recalled
the
past
few
years
the
more
extraordinary
the
more
incredible
was
it
that
he
should
have
made
such
a
difference
between
them
and
an
agonizing
pang
of
unspeakable
anguish
piercing
his
bosom
made
his
heart
beat
like
a
fluttering
rag
its
springs
seemed
broken
and
the
blood
rushed
through
in
a
flood
unchecked
tossing
it
with
wild
surges
then
in
an
undertone
as
a
man
speaks
in
a
nightmare
he
muttered
i
must
know
my
god
i
must
he
looked
further
back
now
to
an
earlier
time
when
his
parents
had
lived
in
paris
but
the
faces
escaped
him
and
this
confused
his
recollections
he
struggled
above
all
to
see
marechal
with
light
or
brown
or
black
hair
but
he
could
not
the
later
image
his
face
as
an
old
man
blotted
out
all
others
however
he
remembered
that
he
had
been
slighter
and
had
a
soft
hand
and
that
he
often
brought
flowers
very
often
for
his
father
would
constantly
say
what
another
bouquet
but
this
is
madness
my
dear
fellow
you
will
ruin
yourself
in
and
marechal
would
say
no
matter
i
like
and
suddenly
his
mother
voice
and
accent
his
mother
as
she
smiled
and
said
thank
you
my
kind
friend
flashed
on
his
brain
so
clearly
that
he
could
have
believed
he
heard
her
she
must
have
spoken
those
words
very
often
that
they
should
remain
thus
graven
on
her
memory
so
marechal
brought
flowers
he
the
gentleman
the
rich
man
the
customer
to
the
humble
the
jeweller
wife
had
he
loved
her
why
should
he
have
made
friends
with
these
tradespeople
if
he
had
not
been
in
love
with
the
wife
he
was
a
man
of
education
and
fairly
refined
tastes
how
many
a
time
had
he
discussed
poets
and
poetry
with
pierre
he
did
not
appreciate
these
writers
from
an
artistic
point
of
view
but
with
sympathetic
and
responsive
feeling
the
doctor
had
often
smiled
at
his
emotions
which
had
struck
him
as
rather
silly
now
he
plainly
saw
that
this
sentimental
soul
could
never
never
have
been
the
friend
of
his
father
who
was
so
so
narrow
so
heavy
to
whom
the
word
poetry
meant
idiocy
this
marechal
then
being
young
free
rich
ready
for
any
form
of
tenderness
went
by
chance
into
the
shop
one
day
having
perhaps
observed
its
pretty
mistress
he
had
bought
something
had
come
again
had
chatted
more
intimately
each
time
paying
by
frequent
purchases
for
the
right
of
a
seat
in
the
family
of
smiling
at
the
young
wife
and
shaking
hands
with
the
husband
and
what
next
what
next
good
god
what
next
he
had
loved
and
petted
the
first
child
the
jeweller
child
till
the
second
was
born
then
till
death
he
had
remained
impenetrable
and
when
his
grave
was
closed
his
flesh
dust
his
name
erased
from
the
list
of
the
living
when
he
himself
was
quiet
and
forever
gone
having
nothing
to
scheme
for
to
dread
or
to
hide
he
had
given
his
whole
fortune
to
the
second
child
why
the
man
had
all
his
wits
he
must
have
understood
and
foreseen
that
he
might
that
he
almost
infallibly
must
give
grounds
for
the
supposition
that
the
child
was
his
he
was
casting
obloquy
on
a
woman
how
could
he
have
done
this
if
jean
were
not
his
son
and
suddenly
a
clear
and
fearful
recollection
shot
through
his
brain
marechal
was
fair
fair
like
jean
he
now
remembered
a
little
miniature
portrait
he
had
seen
formerly
in
paris
on
the
and
which
had
since
disappeared
where
was
it
lost
or
hidden
away
oh
if
he
could
but
have
it
in
his
hand
for
one
minute
his
mother
kept
it
perhaps
in
the
unconfessed
drawer
where
were
treasured
his
misery
in
this
thought
was
so
intense
that
he
uttered
a
groan
one
of
those
brief
moans
wrung
from
the
breast
by
a
too
intolerable
pang
and
immediately
as
if
it
had
heard
him
as
if
it
had
understood
and
answered
him
the
on
the
pier
bellowed
out
close
to
him
its
voice
like
that
of
a
fiendish
monster
more
resonant
than
thunder
a
savage
and
appalling
roar
contrived
to
drown
the
clamour
of
the
wind
and
waves
spread
through
the
darkness
across
the
sea
which
was
invisible
under
its
shroud
of
fog
and
again
through
the
mist
far
and
near
responsive
cries
went
up
to
the
night
they
were
terrifying
these
calls
given
forth
by
the
great
blind
then
all
was
silent
once
more
pierre
had
opened
his
eyes
and
was
looking
about
him
startled
to
find
himself
here
roused
from
his
nightmare
i
am
mad
thought
he
i
suspect
my
and
a
surge
of
love
and
emotion
of
repentance
and
prayer
and
grief
welled
up
in
his
heart
his
mother
knowing
her
as
he
knew
her
how
could
he
ever
have
suspected
her
was
not
the
soul
was
not
the
life
of
this
chaste
and
loyal
woman
clearer
than
water
could
any
one
who
had
seen
and
known
her
ever
think
of
her
but
as
above
suspicion
and
he
her
son
had
doubted
her
oh
if
he
could
but
have
taken
her
in
his
arms
at
that
moment
how
he
would
have
kissed
and
caressed
her
and
gone
on
his
knees
to
crave
pardon
would
she
have
deceived
his
father
she
his
father
a
very
worthy
man
no
doubt
upright
and
honest
in
business
but
with
a
mind
which
had
never
gone
beyond
the
horizon
of
his
shop
how
was
it
that
this
woman
who
must
have
been
very
pretty
as
he
knew
and
it
could
still
be
seen
gifted
too
with
a
delicate
tender
emotional
soul
could
have
accepted
a
man
so
unlike
herself
as
a
suitor
and
a
husband
why
inquire
she
had
married
as
young
french
girls
do
marry
the
youth
with
a
little
fortune
proposed
to
her
by
their
relations
they
had
settled
at
once
in
their
shop
in
the
rue
montmartre
and
the
young
wife
ruling
over
the
desk
inspired
by
the
feeling
of
a
new
home
and
the
subtle
and
sacred
sense
of
interests
in
common
which
fills
the
place
of
love
and
even
of
regard
by
the
domestic
hearth
of
most
of
the
commercial
houses
of
paris
had
set
to
work
with
all
her
superior
and
active
intelligence
to
make
the
fortune
they
hoped
for
and
so
her
life
had
flowed
on
uniform
peaceful
and
respectable
but
loveless
loveless
was
it
possible
then
that
a
woman
should
not
love
that
a
young
and
pretty
woman
living
in
paris
reading
books
applauding
actresses
for
dying
of
passion
on
the
stage
could
live
from
youth
to
old
age
without
once
feeling
her
heart
touched
he
would
not
believe
it
of
any
one
else
why
should
she
be
different
from
all
others
though
she
was
his
mother
she
had
been
young
with
all
the
poetic
weaknesses
which
agitate
the
heart
of
a
young
creature
shut
up
imprisoned
in
the
shop
by
the
side
of
a
vulgar
husband
who
always
talked
of
trade
she
had
dreamed
of
moonlight
nights
of
voyages
of
kisses
exchanged
in
the
shades
of
evening
and
then
one
day
a
man
had
come
in
as
lovers
do
in
books
and
had
talked
as
they
talk
she
had
loved
him
why
not
she
was
his
mother
what
then
must
a
man
be
blind
and
stupid
to
the
point
of
rejecting
evidence
because
it
concerns
his
mother
but
did
she
give
herself
to
him
why
yes
since
this
man
had
had
no
other
love
since
he
had
remained
faithful
to
her
when
she
was
far
away
and
growing
old
why
yes
since
he
had
left
all
his
fortune
to
his
son
their
son
and
pierre
started
to
his
feet
quivering
with
such
rage
that
he
longed
to
kill
some
one
with
his
arm
outstretched
his
hand
wide
open
he
wanted
to
hit
to
bruise
to
smash
to
strangle
whom
every
one
his
father
his
brother
the
dead
man
his
mother
he
hurried
off
homeward
what
was
he
going
to
do
as
he
passed
a
turret
close
to
the
signal
mast
the
strident
howl
of
the
went
off
in
his
very
face
he
was
so
startled
that
he
nearly
fell
and
shrank
back
as
far
as
the
granite
parapet
he
sat
down
by
the
sudden
shock
the
steamer
which
was
the
first
to
reply
seemed
to
be
quite
near
and
was
already
at
the
entrance
the
tide
having
risen
pierre
turned
round
and
could
discern
its
red
eye
dim
through
the
fog
then
in
the
broad
light
of
the
electric
lanterns
a
huge
black
shadow
crept
up
between
the
piers
behind
him
the
voice
of
the
man
the
hoarse
voice
of
an
old
retired
shouted
what
ship
and
out
of
the
fog
the
voice
of
the
pilot
standing
on
deck
not
less
hoarse
replied
the
santa
where
from
what
port
and
before
pierre
bewildered
eyes
rose
as
he
fancied
the
fiery
pennon
of
vesuvius
while
at
the
foot
of
the
volcano
danced
in
the
of
sorrento
or
castellamare
how
often
had
he
dreamed
of
these
familiar
names
as
if
he
knew
the
scenery
oh
if
he
might
but
go
away
now
at
once
never
mind
whither
and
never
come
back
never
write
never
let
any
one
know
what
had
become
of
him
but
no
he
must
go
home
home
to
his
father
house
and
go
to
bed
he
would
not
come
what
might
he
would
not
go
in
he
would
stay
there
till
daybreak
he
liked
the
roar
of
the
he
pulled
himself
together
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
like
an
officer
on
watch
another
vessel
was
coming
in
behind
the
other
huge
and
mysterious
an
english
homeward
bound
he
saw
several
more
come
in
one
after
another
out
of
the
impenetrable
vapour
then
as
the
damp
became
quite
intolerable
pierre
set
out
towards
the
town
he
was
so
cold
that
he
went
into
a
sailors
tavern
to
drink
a
glass
of
grog
and
when
the
hot
and
pungent
liquor
had
scorched
his
mouth
and
throat
he
felt
a
hope
revive
within
him
perhaps
he
was
mistaken
he
knew
his
own
vagabond
unreason
so
well
no
doubt
he
was
mistaken
he
had
piled
up
the
evidence
as
a
charge
is
drawn
up
against
an
innocent
person
whom
it
is
always
so
easy
to
convict
when
we
wish
to
think
him
guilty
when
he
should
have
slept
he
would
think
differently
then
he
went
in
and
to
bed
and
by
sheer
force
of
will
he
at
last
dropped
asleep
chapter
v
but
the
doctor
frame
lay
scarcely
more
than
an
hour
or
two
in
the
torpor
of
troubled
slumbers
when
he
awoke
in
the
darkness
of
his
warm
closed
room
he
was
aware
even
before
thought
was
awake
in
him
of
the
painful
oppression
the
sickness
of
heart
which
the
sorrow
we
have
slept
on
leaves
behind
it
it
is
as
though
the
disaster
of
which
the
shock
merely
jarred
us
at
first
had
during
sleep
stolen
into
our
very
flesh
bruising
and
exhausting
it
like
a
fever
memory
returned
to
him
like
a
blow
and
he
sat
up
in
bed
then
slowly
one
by
one
he
again
went
through
all
the
arguments
which
had
wrung
his
heart
on
the
jetty
while
the
were
bellowing
the
more
he
thought
the
less
he
doubted
he
felt
himself
dragged
along
by
his
logic
to
the
inevitable
certainty
as
by
a
clutching
strangling
hand
he
was
thirsty
and
hot
his
heart
beat
wildly
he
got
up
to
open
his
window
and
breathe
the
fresh
air
and
as
he
stood
there
a
low
sound
fell
on
his
ear
through
the
wall
jean
was
sleeping
peacefully
and
gently
snoring
he
could
sleep
he
had
no
presentiment
no
suspicions
a
man
who
had
known
their
mother
had
left
him
all
his
fortune
he
took
the
money
and
thought
it
quite
fair
and
natural
he
was
sleeping
rich
and
contented
not
knowing
that
his
brother
was
gasping
with
anguish
and
distress
and
rage
boiled
up
in
him
against
this
heedless
and
happy
sleeper
only
yesterday
he
would
have
knocked
at
his
door
have
gone
in
and
sitting
by
the
bed
would
have
said
to
jean
scared
by
the
sudden
waking
jean
you
must
not
keep
this
legacy
which
by
may
have
brought
suspicion
and
dishonour
on
our
but
he
could
say
nothing
he
could
not
tell
jean
that
he
did
not
believe
him
to
be
their
father
son
now
he
must
guard
must
bury
the
shame
he
had
discovered
hide
from
every
eye
the
stain
which
he
had
detected
and
which
no
one
must
perceive
not
even
his
brother
especially
not
his
brother
he
no
longer
thought
about
the
vain
respect
of
public
opinion
he
would
have
been
glad
that
all
the
world
should
accuse
his
mother
if
only
he
he
alone
knew
her
to
be
innocent
how
could
he
bear
to
live
with
her
every
day
believing
as
he
looked
at
her
that
his
brother
was
the
child
of
a
stranger
love
and
how
calm
and
serene
she
was
nevertheless
how
sure
of
herself
she
always
seemed
was
it
possible
that
such
a
woman
as
she
pure
of
soul
and
upright
in
heart
should
fall
dragged
astray
by
passion
and
yet
nothing
ever
appear
afterward
of
her
remorse
and
the
stings
of
a
troubled
conscience
ah
but
remorse
must
have
tortured
her
long
ago
in
the
earlier
days
and
then
have
faded
out
as
everything
fades
she
had
surely
bewailed
her
sin
and
then
little
by
little
had
almost
forgotten
it
have
not
all
women
all
this
fault
of
prodigious
forgetfulness
which
enables
them
after
a
few
years
hardly
to
recognise
the
man
to
whose
kisses
they
have
given
their
lips
the
kiss
strikes
like
a
thunderbolt
the
love
passes
away
like
a
storm
and
then
life
like
the
sky
is
calm
once
more
and
begins
again
as
it
was
before
do
we
ever
remember
a
cloud
pierre
could
no
longer
endure
to
stay
in
the
room
this
house
his
father
house
crushed
him
he
felt
the
roof
weigh
on
his
head
and
the
walls
suffocate
him
and
as
he
was
very
thirsty
he
lighted
his
candle
to
go
to
drink
a
glass
of
fresh
water
from
the
filter
in
the
kitchen
he
went
down
the
two
flights
of
stairs
then
as
he
was
coming
up
again
with
the
filled
he
sat
down
in
his
on
a
step
of
the
stairs
where
there
was
a
draught
and
drank
without
a
tumbler
in
long
pulls
like
a
runner
who
is
out
of
breath
when
he
ceased
to
move
the
silence
of
the
house
touched
his
feelings
then
one
by
one
he
could
distinguish
the
faintest
sounds
first
there
was
the
ticking
of
the
clock
in
the
which
seemed
to
grow
louder
every
second
then
he
heard
another
snore
an
old
man
snore
short
laboured
and
hard
his
father
beyond
doubt
and
he
writhed
at
the
idea
as
if
it
had
but
this
moment
sprung
upon
him
that
these
two
men
sleeping
under
the
same
room
father
and
son
were
nothing
to
each
other
not
a
tie
not
the
very
slightest
bound
them
together
and
they
did
not
know
it
they
spoke
to
each
other
affectionately
they
embraced
each
other
they
rejoiced
and
lamented
together
over
the
same
things
just
as
if
the
same
blood
flowed
in
their
veins
and
two
men
born
at
opposite
ends
of
the
earth
could
not
be
more
alien
to
each
other
than
this
father
and
son
they
believed
they
loved
each
other
because
a
lie
had
grown
up
between
them
this
paternal
love
this
filial
love
were
the
outcome
of
a
lie
a
lie
which
could
not
be
unmasked
and
which
no
one
would
ever
know
but
he
the
true
son
but
yet
but
yet
if
he
were
mistaken
how
could
he
make
sure
oh
if
only
some
likeness
however
slight
could
be
traced
between
his
father
and
jean
one
of
those
mysterious
resemblances
which
run
from
an
ancestor
to
the
showing
that
the
whole
race
are
the
offspring
of
the
same
embrace
to
him
a
medical
man
so
little
would
suffice
to
enable
him
to
discern
this
the
curve
of
a
nostril
the
space
between
the
eyes
the
character
of
the
teeth
or
hair
nay
less
a
gesture
a
trick
a
habit
an
inherited
taste
any
mark
or
token
which
a
practised
eye
might
recognise
as
characteristic
he
thought
long
but
could
remember
nothing
no
nothing
but
he
had
looked
carelessly
observed
badly
having
no
reason
for
spying
such
imperceptible
indications
he
got
up
to
go
back
to
his
room
and
mounted
the
stairs
with
a
slow
step
still
lost
in
thought
as
he
passed
the
door
of
his
brother
room
he
stood
stock
still
his
hand
put
out
to
open
it
an
imperative
need
had
just
come
over
him
to
see
jean
at
once
to
look
at
him
at
his
leisure
to
surprise
him
in
his
sleep
while
the
calm
countenance
and
relaxed
features
were
at
rest
and
all
the
grimace
of
life
put
off
thus
he
might
catch
the
dormant
secret
of
his
physiognomy
and
if
any
appreciable
likeness
existed
it
would
not
escape
him
but
supposing
jean
were
to
wake
what
could
he
say
how
could
he
explain
this
intrusion
he
stood
still
his
fingers
clinched
on
the
trying
to
devise
a
reason
an
excuse
then
he
remembered
that
a
week
ago
he
had
lent
his
brother
a
phial
of
laudanum
to
relieve
a
fit
of
toothache
he
might
himself
have
been
in
pain
this
night
and
have
come
to
find
the
drug
so
he
went
in
with
a
stealthy
step
like
a
robber
jean
his
mouth
open
was
sunk
in
deep
animal
slumbers
his
beard
and
fair
hair
made
a
golden
patch
on
the
white
linen
he
did
not
wake
but
he
ceased
snoring
pierre
leaning
over
him
gazed
at
him
with
hungry
eagerness
no
this
youngster
was
not
in
the
least
like
roland
and
for
the
second
time
the
recollection
of
the
little
portrait
of
marechal
which
had
vanished
recurred
to
his
mind
he
must
find
it
when
he
should
see
it
perhaps
he
should
cease
to
doubt
his
brother
stirred
conscious
no
doubt
of
a
presence
or
disturbed
by
the
light
of
the
taper
on
his
eyelids
the
doctor
retired
on
to
the
door
which
he
noiselessly
closed
then
he
went
back
to
his
room
but
not
to
bed
again
day
was
long
in
coming
the
hours
struck
one
after
another
on
the
clock
and
its
tone
was
a
deep
and
solemn
one
as
though
the
little
piece
of
clockwork
had
swallowed
a
the
sound
rose
through
the
empty
staircase
penetrating
through
walls
and
doors
and
dying
away
in
the
rooms
where
it
fell
on
the
torpid
ears
of
the
sleeping
household
pierre
had
taken
to
walking
to
and
fro
between
his
bed
and
the
window
what
was
he
going
to
do
he
was
too
much
upset
to
spend
this
day
at
home
he
wanted
still
to
be
alone
at
any
rate
till
the
next
day
to
reflect
to
compose
himself
to
strengthen
himself
for
the
common
life
which
he
must
take
up
again
well
he
would
go
over
to
trouville
to
see
the
swarming
crowd
on
the
sands
that
would
amuse
him
change
the
air
of
his
thoughts
and
give
him
time
to
inure
himself
to
the
horrible
thing
he
had
discovered
as
soon
as
morning
dawned
he
made
his
toilet
and
dressed
the
fog
had
vanished
and
it
was
fine
very
fine
as
the
boat
for
trouville
did
not
start
till
nine
it
struck
the
doctor
that
he
must
greet
his
mother
before
starting
he
waited
till
the
hour
at
which
she
was
accustomed
to
get
up
and
then
went
downstairs
his
heart
beat
so
violently
as
he
touched
her
door
that
he
paused
for
breath
his
hand
as
it
lay
on
the
lock
was
limp
and
tremulous
almost
incapable
of
the
slight
effort
of
turning
the
handle
to
open
it
he
knocked
his
mother
voice
inquired
who
is
there
i
what
do
you
want
only
to
say
because
i
am
going
to
spend
the
day
at
trouville
with
some
but
i
am
still
in
very
well
do
not
disturb
yourself
i
shall
see
you
this
evening
when
i
come
he
hoped
to
get
off
without
seeing
her
without
pressing
on
her
cheek
the
false
kiss
which
it
made
his
heart
sick
to
think
of
but
she
replied
no
wait
a
moment
i
will
let
you
in
wait
till
i
get
into
bed
he
heard
her
bare
feet
on
the
floor
and
the
sound
of
the
bolt
drawn
back
then
she
called
out
come
he
went
in
she
was
sitting
up
in
bed
while
by
her
side
roland
with
a
silk
handkerchief
by
way
of
and
his
face
to
the
wall
still
lay
sleeping
nothing
ever
woke
him
but
a
shaking
hard
enough
to
pull
his
arm
off
on
the
days
when
he
went
fishing
it
was
josephine
rung
up
by
papagris
at
the
hour
fixed
who
roused
her
master
from
his
stubborn
slumbers
pierre
as
he
went
towards
his
mother
looked
at
her
with
a
sudden
sense
of
never
having
seen
her
before
she
held
up
her
face
he
kissed
each
cheek
and
then
sat
down
in
a
low
chair
it
was
last
evening
that
you
decided
on
this
excursion
she
asked
yes
last
will
you
return
to
dinner
i
do
not
know
at
any
rate
do
not
wait
for
he
looked
at
her
with
stupefied
curiosity
this
woman
was
his
mother
all
those
features
seen
daily
from
childhood
from
the
time
when
his
eye
could
first
distinguish
things
that
smile
that
voice
so
well
known
so
familiar
abruptly
struck
him
as
new
different
from
what
they
had
always
been
to
him
hitherto
he
understood
now
that
loving
her
he
had
never
looked
at
her
all
the
same
it
was
very
really
she
and
he
knew
every
little
detail
of
her
face
still
it
was
the
first
time
he
clearly
identified
them
all
his
anxious
attention
scrutinizing
her
face
which
he
loved
recalled
a
difference
a
physiognomy
he
had
never
before
discerned
he
rose
to
go
then
suddenly
yielding
to
the
invincible
longing
to
know
which
had
been
gnawing
at
him
since
yesterday
he
said
by
the
way
i
fancy
i
remember
that
you
used
to
have
in
paris
a
little
portrait
of
marechal
in
the
she
hesitated
for
a
second
or
two
or
at
least
he
fancied
she
hesitated
then
she
said
to
be
what
has
become
of
the
portrait
she
might
have
replied
more
readily
that
portrait
stay
i
do
exactly
know
perhaps
it
is
in
my
it
would
be
kind
of
you
to
find
yes
i
will
look
for
it
what
do
you
want
it
for
oh
it
is
not
for
myself
i
thought
it
would
be
a
natural
thing
to
give
it
to
jean
and
that
he
would
be
pleased
to
have
yes
you
are
right
that
is
a
good
idea
i
will
look
for
it
as
soon
as
i
am
and
he
went
out
it
was
a
blue
day
without
a
breath
of
wind
the
folks
in
the
streets
seemed
in
good
spirits
the
merchants
going
to
business
the
clerks
going
to
their
office
the
girls
going
to
their
shop
some
sang
as
they
went
exhilarated
by
the
bright
weather
the
passengers
were
already
going
on
board
the
trouville
boat
pierre
took
a
seat
aft
on
a
wooden
bench
he
asked
himself
now
was
she
uneasy
at
my
asking
for
the
portrait
or
only
surprised
has
she
mislaid
it
or
has
she
hidden
it
does
she
know
where
it
is
or
does
she
not
if
she
had
hidden
it
why
and
his
mind
still
following
up
the
same
line
of
thought
from
one
deduction
to
another
came
to
this
conclusion
that
portrait
of
a
friend
of
a
lover
had
remained
in
the
in
a
conspicuous
place
till
one
day
when
the
wife
and
mother
perceived
first
of
all
and
before
any
one
else
that
it
bore
a
likeness
to
her
son
without
doubt
she
had
for
a
long
time
been
on
the
watch
for
this
resemblance
then
having
detected
it
having
noticed
its
beginnings
and
understanding
that
any
one
might
any
day
observe
it
too
she
had
one
evening
removed
the
perilous
little
picture
and
had
hidden
it
not
daring
to
destroy
it
pierre
recollected
quite
clearly
now
that
it
was
long
long
before
they
left
paris
that
the
miniature
had
vanished
it
had
disappeared
he
thought
about
the
time
that
jean
beard
was
beginning
to
grow
which
had
made
him
suddenly
and
wonderfully
like
the
fair
young
man
who
smiled
from
the
the
motion
of
the
boat
as
it
put
off
disturbed
and
dissipated
his
meditations
he
stood
up
and
looked
at
the
sea
the
little
steamer
once
outside
the
piers
turned
to
the
left
and
puffing
and
snorting
and
quivering
made
for
a
distant
point
visible
through
the
morning
haze
the
red
sail
of
a
heavy
lying
motionless
on
the
level
waters
looked
like
a
large
rock
standing
up
out
of
the
sea
and
the
seine
rolling
down
from
rouen
seemed
a
wide
inlet
dividing
two
neighbouring
lands
they
reached
the
harbour
of
trouville
in
less
than
an
hour
and
as
it
was
the
time
of
day
when
the
world
was
bathing
pierre
went
to
the
shore
from
a
distance
it
looked
like
a
garden
full
of
gaudy
flowers
all
along
the
stretch
of
yellow
sand
from
the
pier
as
far
as
the
roches
noires
of
every
hue
hats
of
every
shape
dresses
of
every
colour
in
groups
outside
the
bathing
huts
in
long
rows
by
the
margin
of
the
waves
or
scattered
here
and
there
really
looked
like
immense
bouquets
on
a
vast
meadow
and
the
babel
of
sounds
voices
near
and
far
ringing
thin
in
the
light
atmosphere
shouts
and
cries
of
children
being
bathed
clear
laughter
of
women
all
made
a
pleasant
continuous
din
mingling
with
the
unheeding
breeze
and
breathed
with
the
air
itself
pierre
walked
among
all
this
throng
more
lost
more
remote
from
them
more
isolated
more
drowned
in
his
torturing
thoughts
than
if
he
had
been
flung
overboard
from
the
deck
of
a
ship
a
hundred
miles
from
shore
he
passed
by
them
and
heard
a
few
sentences
without
listening
and
he
saw
without
looking
how
the
men
spoke
to
the
women
and
the
women
smiled
at
the
men
then
suddenly
as
if
he
had
awoke
he
perceived
them
all
and
hatred
of
them
all
surged
up
in
his
soul
for
they
seemed
happy
and
content
now
as
he
went
he
studied
the
groups
wandering
round
them
full
of
a
fresh
set
of
ideas
all
these
dresses
which
covered
the
sands
like
nosegays
these
pretty
stuffs
those
showy
parasols
the
fictitious
grace
of
tightened
waists
all
the
ingenious
devices
of
fashion
from
the
smart
little
shoe
to
the
extravagant
hat
the
seductive
charm
of
gesture
voice
and
smile
all
the
coquettish
airs
in
short
displayed
on
this
seashore
suddenly
struck
him
as
stupendous
efflorescences
of
female
depravity
all
these
bedizened
women
aimed
at
pleasing
bewitching
and
deluding
some
man
they
had
dressed
themselves
out
for
men
for
all
men
all
excepting
the
husband
whom
they
no
longer
needed
to
conquer
they
had
dressed
themselves
out
for
the
lover
of
yesterday
and
the
lover
of
for
the
stranger
they
might
meet
and
notice
or
were
perhaps
on
the
lookout
for
and
these
men
sitting
close
to
them
eye
to
eye
and
mouth
to
mouth
invited
them
desired
them
hunted
them
like
game
coy
and
elusive
notwithstanding
that
it
seemed
so
near
and
so
easy
to
capture
this
wide
shore
was
then
no
more
than
a
where
some
sold
others
gave
themselves
some
drove
a
hard
bargain
for
their
kisses
while
others
promised
them
for
love
all
these
women
thought
only
of
one
thing
to
make
their
bodies
desirable
bodies
already
given
sold
or
promised
to
other
men
and
he
reflected
that
it
was
everywhere
the
same
all
the
world
over
his
mother
had
done
what
others
did
that
was
all
others
these
women
he
saw
about
him
rich
giddy
belonged
on
the
whole
to
the
class
of
fashionable
and
showy
women
of
the
world
some
indeed
to
the
less
respectable
sisterhood
for
on
these
sands
trampled
by
the
legion
of
idlers
the
tribe
of
virtuous
women
were
not
to
be
seen
the
tide
was
rising
driving
the
foremost
rank
of
visitors
gradually
landward
he
saw
the
various
groups
jump
up
and
fly
carrying
their
chairs
with
them
before
the
yellow
waves
as
they
rolled
up
edged
with
a
frill
of
foam
the
too
were
being
pulled
up
by
horses
and
along
the
planked
way
which
formed
the
promenade
running
along
the
shore
from
end
to
end
there
was
now
an
increasing
flow
slow
and
dense
of
people
in
two
opposite
streams
elbowing
and
mingling
pierre
made
nervous
and
exasperated
by
this
bustle
made
his
escape
into
the
town
and
went
to
get
his
breakfast
at
a
modest
tavern
on
the
skirts
of
the
fields
when
he
had
finished
with
coffee
he
stretched
his
legs
on
a
couple
of
chairs
under
a
in
front
of
the
house
and
as
he
had
hardly
slept
the
night
before
he
presently
fell
into
a
doze
after
resting
for
some
hours
he
shook
himself
and
finding
that
it
was
time
to
go
on
board
again
he
set
out
tormented
by
a
sudden
stiffness
which
had
come
upon
him
during
his
long
nap
now
he
was
eager
to
be
at
home
again
to
know
whether
his
mother
had
found
the
portrait
of
marechal
would
she
be
the
first
to
speak
of
it
or
would
he
be
obliged
to
ask
for
it
again
if
she
waited
to
be
questioned
further
it
must
be
because
she
had
some
secret
reason
for
not
showing
the
miniature
but
when
he
was
at
home
again
and
in
his
room
he
hesitated
about
going
down
to
dinner
he
was
too
wretched
his
revolted
soul
had
not
yet
time
to
calm
down
however
he
made
up
his
mind
to
it
and
appeared
in
the
just
as
they
were
sitting
down
all
their
faces
were
beaming
well
said
roland
are
you
getting
on
with
your
purchases
i
do
not
want
to
see
anything
till
it
is
all
in
its
and
his
wife
replied
oh
yes
we
are
getting
on
but
it
takes
much
consideration
to
avoid
buying
things
that
do
not
match
the
furniture
question
is
an
absorbing
she
had
spent
the
day
in
going
with
jean
to
and
upholsterers
her
fancy
was
for
rich
materials
rather
splendid
to
strike
the
eye
at
once
her
son
on
the
contrary
wished
for
something
simple
and
elegant
so
in
front
of
everything
put
before
them
they
had
each
repeated
their
arguments
she
declared
that
a
client
a
defendant
must
be
impressed
that
as
soon
as
he
is
shown
into
his
he
should
have
a
sense
of
wealth
jean
on
the
other
hand
wishing
to
attract
only
an
elegant
and
opulent
class
was
anxious
to
captivate
persons
of
refinement
by
his
quiet
and
perfect
taste
and
this
discussion
which
had
gone
on
all
day
began
again
with
the
soup
roland
had
no
opinion
he
repeated
i
do
not
want
to
hear
anything
about
it
i
will
go
and
see
it
when
it
is
all
mme
roland
appealed
to
the
judgment
of
her
elder
son
and
you
pierre
what
do
you
think
of
the
matter
his
nerves
were
in
a
state
of
such
intense
excitement
that
he
would
have
liked
to
reply
with
an
oath
however
he
only
answered
in
a
dry
tone
quivering
with
annoyance
oh
i
am
quite
of
jean
mind
i
like
nothing
so
well
as
simplicity
which
in
matters
of
taste
is
equivalent
to
rectitude
in
matters
of
his
mother
went
on
you
must
remember
that
we
live
in
a
city
of
commercial
men
where
good
taste
is
not
to
be
met
with
at
every
pierre
replied
what
does
that
matter
is
that
a
reason
for
living
as
fools
do
if
my
are
stupid
and
need
i
follow
their
example
a
woman
does
not
misconduct
herself
because
her
neighbour
has
a
jean
began
to
laugh
you
argue
by
comparisons
which
seem
to
have
been
borrowed
from
the
maxims
of
a
pierre
made
no
reply
his
mother
and
his
brother
reverted
to
the
question
of
stuffs
and
he
sat
looking
at
them
as
he
had
looked
at
his
mother
in
the
morning
before
starting
for
trouville
looking
at
them
as
a
stranger
who
would
study
them
and
he
felt
as
though
he
had
really
suddenly
come
into
a
family
of
which
he
knew
nothing
his
father
above
all
amazed
his
eyes
and
his
mind
that
flabby
burly
man
happy
and
besotted
was
his
own
father
no
no
jean
was
not
in
the
least
like
him
his
family
within
these
two
days
an
unknown
and
malignant
hand
the
hand
of
a
dead
man
had
torn
asunder
and
broken
one
by
one
all
the
ties
which
had
held
these
four
human
beings
together
it
was
all
over
all
ruined
he
had
now
no
mother
for
he
could
no
longer
love
her
now
that
he
could
not
revere
her
with
that
perfect
tender
and
pious
respect
which
a
love
demands
no
brother
since
his
brother
was
the
child
of
a
stranger
nothing
was
left
him
but
his
father
that
coarse
man
whom
he
could
not
love
in
spite
of
himself
and
he
suddenly
broke
out
i
say
mother
have
you
found
that
portrait
she
opened
her
eyes
in
surprise
what
portrait
the
portrait
of
no
that
is
to
say
yes
i
have
not
found
it
but
i
think
i
know
where
it
what
is
that
asked
roland
and
pierre
answered
a
little
likeness
of
marechal
which
used
to
be
in
the
in
paris
i
thought
that
jean
might
be
glad
to
have
roland
exclaimed
why
yes
to
be
sure
i
remember
it
perfectly
i
saw
it
again
last
week
your
mother
found
it
in
her
desk
when
she
was
tidying
the
papers
it
was
on
thursday
or
friday
do
you
remember
louise
i
was
shaving
myself
when
you
took
it
out
and
laid
in
on
a
chair
by
your
side
with
a
pile
of
letters
of
which
you
burned
half
strange
is
it
that
you
should
have
come
across
the
portrait
only
two
or
three
days
before
jean
heard
of
his
legacy
if
i
believed
in
presentiments
i
should
think
that
this
was
mme
roland
calmly
replied
yes
i
know
where
it
is
i
will
fetch
it
then
she
had
lied
when
she
had
said
that
very
morning
to
her
son
who
had
asked
her
what
had
become
of
the
miniature
i
do
exactly
know
perhaps
it
is
in
my
desk
it
was
a
lie
she
had
seen
it
touched
it
handled
it
gazed
at
it
but
a
few
days
since
and
then
she
had
hidden
it
away
again
in
the
secret
drawer
with
those
letters
his
letters
pierre
looked
at
the
mother
who
had
lied
to
him
looked
at
her
with
the
concentrated
fury
of
a
son
who
had
been
cheated
robbed
of
his
most
sacred
affection
and
with
the
jealous
wrath
of
a
man
who
after
long
being
blind
at
last
discovers
a
disgraceful
betrayal
if
he
had
been
that
woman
husband
and
not
her
child
he
would
have
gripped
her
by
the
wrists
seized
her
by
the
shoulders
or
the
hair
have
flung
her
on
the
ground
have
hit
her
hurt
her
crushed
her
and
he
might
say
nothing
do
nothing
show
nothing
reveal
nothing
he
was
her
son
he
had
no
vengeance
to
take
and
he
had
not
been
deceived
nay
but
she
had
deceived
his
tenderness
his
pious
respect
she
owed
to
him
to
be
without
reproach
as
all
mothers
owe
it
to
their
children
if
the
fury
that
boiled
within
him
verged
on
hatred
it
was
that
he
felt
her
to
be
even
more
guilty
towards
him
than
toward
his
father
the
love
of
man
and
wife
is
a
voluntary
compact
in
which
the
one
who
proves
weak
is
guilty
only
of
perfidy
but
when
the
wife
is
a
mother
her
duty
is
a
higher
one
since
nature
has
intrusted
her
with
a
race
if
she
fails
then
she
is
cowardly
worthless
infamous
i
do
not
care
said
roland
suddenly
stretching
out
his
legs
under
the
table
as
he
did
every
evening
while
he
sipped
his
glass
of
brandy
you
may
do
worse
than
live
idle
when
you
have
a
snug
little
income
i
hope
jean
will
have
us
to
dinner
in
style
now
hang
it
all
if
i
have
indigestion
now
and
then
i
can
not
help
then
turning
to
his
wife
he
added
go
and
fetch
that
portrait
little
woman
as
you
have
done
your
dinner
i
should
like
to
see
it
again
she
rose
took
a
taper
and
went
then
after
an
absence
which
pierre
thought
long
though
she
was
not
away
more
than
three
minutes
mme
roland
returned
smiling
and
holding
an
gilt
frame
by
the
ring
here
it
is
said
she
i
found
it
at
the
doctor
was
the
first
to
put
forth
his
hand
he
took
the
picture
and
holding
it
a
little
away
from
him
he
examined
it
then
fully
aware
that
his
mother
was
looking
at
him
he
slowly
raised
his
eyes
and
fixed
them
on
his
brother
to
compare
the
faces
he
could
hardly
refrain
in
his
violence
from
saying
dear
me
how
like
jean
and
though
he
dared
not
utter
the
terrible
words
he
betrayed
his
thought
by
his
manner
of
comparing
the
living
face
with
the
painted
one
they
had
no
doubt
details
in
common
the
same
beard
the
same
brow
but
nothing
sufficiently
marked
to
justify
the
assertion
this
is
the
father
and
that
the
it
was
rather
a
family
likeness
a
relationship
of
physiognomies
in
which
the
same
blood
courses
but
what
to
pierre
was
far
more
decisive
than
the
common
aspect
of
the
faces
was
that
his
mother
had
risen
had
turned
her
back
and
was
pretending
too
deliberately
to
be
putting
the
sugar
basin
and
the
liqueur
bottle
away
in
a
cupboard
she
understood
that
he
knew
or
at
any
rate
had
his
suspicions
hand
it
on
to
me
said
roland
pierre
held
out
the
miniature
and
his
father
drew
the
candle
towards
him
to
see
it
better
then
he
murmured
in
a
pathetic
tone
poor
fellow
to
think
that
he
was
like
that
when
we
first
knew
him
cristi
how
time
flies
he
was
a
man
too
in
those
days
and
with
such
a
pleasant
manner
was
not
he
louise
as
his
wife
made
no
answer
he
went
on
and
what
an
even
temper
i
never
saw
him
put
out
and
now
it
is
all
at
an
end
nothing
left
of
him
but
what
he
bequeathed
to
jean
well
at
any
rate
you
may
take
your
oath
that
that
man
was
a
good
and
faithful
friend
to
the
last
even
on
his
he
did
not
forget
jean
in
his
turn
held
out
his
hand
for
the
picture
he
gazed
at
it
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
said
regretfully
i
do
not
recognise
it
at
all
i
only
remember
him
with
white
he
returned
the
miniature
to
his
mother
she
cast
a
hasty
glance
at
it
looking
away
as
if
she
were
frightened
then
in
her
usual
voice
she
said
it
belongs
to
you
now
my
little
jean
as
you
are
his
heir
we
will
take
it
to
your
new
and
when
they
went
into
the
she
placed
the
picture
on
the
by
the
clock
where
it
had
formerly
stood
roland
filled
his
pipe
pierre
and
jean
lighted
cigarettes
they
commonly
smoked
them
pierre
while
he
paced
the
room
jean
sunk
in
a
deep
with
his
legs
crossed
their
father
always
sat
astride
a
chair
and
spat
from
afar
into
the
mme
roland
on
a
low
seat
by
a
little
table
on
which
the
lamp
stood
embroidered
or
knitted
or
marked
linen
this
evening
she
was
beginning
a
piece
of
worsted
work
intended
for
jean
lodgings
it
was
a
difficult
and
complicated
pattern
and
required
all
her
attention
still
now
and
again
her
eye
which
was
counting
the
stitches
glanced
up
swiftly
and
furtively
at
the
little
portrait
of
the
dead
as
it
leaned
against
the
clock
and
the
doctor
who
was
striding
to
and
fro
across
the
little
room
in
four
or
five
steps
met
his
mother
look
at
each
turn
it
was
as
though
they
were
spying
on
each
other
and
acute
uneasiness
intolerable
to
be
borne
clutched
at
pierre
heart
he
was
saying
to
himself
at
once
tortured
and
glad
she
must
be
in
misery
at
this
moment
if
she
knows
that
i
guess
and
each
time
he
reached
the
he
stopped
for
a
few
seconds
to
look
at
marechal
fair
hair
and
show
quite
plainly
that
he
was
haunted
by
a
fixed
idea
so
that
this
little
portrait
smaller
than
an
opened
palm
was
like
a
living
being
malignant
and
threatening
suddenly
brought
into
this
house
and
this
family
presently
the
bell
rang
mme
roland
always
so
started
violently
betraying
to
her
doctor
son
the
anguish
of
her
nerves
then
she
said
it
must
be
mme
rosemilly
and
her
eye
again
anxiously
turned
to
the
pierre
understood
or
thought
he
understood
her
fears
and
misery
a
woman
eye
is
keen
a
woman
wit
is
nimble
and
her
instincts
suspicious
when
this
woman
who
was
coming
in
should
see
the
miniature
of
a
man
she
did
not
know
she
might
perhaps
at
the
first
glance
discover
the
likeness
between
this
face
and
jean
then
she
would
know
and
understand
everything
he
was
seized
with
dread
a
sudden
and
horrible
dread
of
this
shame
being
unveiled
and
turning
about
just
as
the
door
opened
he
took
the
little
painting
and
slipped
it
under
the
clock
without
being
seen
by
his
father
and
brother
when
he
met
his
mother
eyes
again
they
seemed
to
him
altered
dim
and
haggard
good
evening
said
mme
rosemilly
i
have
come
to
ask
you
for
a
cup
of
but
while
they
were
bustling
about
her
and
asking
after
her
health
pierre
made
off
the
door
having
been
left
open
when
his
absence
was
perceived
they
were
all
surprised
jean
annoyed
for
the
young
widow
who
he
thought
would
be
hurt
muttered
what
a
bear
mme
roland
replied
you
must
not
be
vexed
with
him
he
is
not
very
well
and
tired
with
his
excursion
to
never
mind
said
roland
that
is
no
reason
for
taking
himself
off
like
a
mme
rosemilly
tried
to
smooth
matters
by
saying
not
at
all
not
at
all
he
has
gone
away
in
the
english
fashion
people
always
disappear
in
that
way
in
fashionable
circles
if
they
want
to
leave
oh
in
fashionable
circles
i
dare
say
replied
jean
but
a
man
does
not
treat
his
family
and
my
brother
has
done
nothing
else
for
some
time
chapter
vi
for
a
week
or
two
nothing
occurred
the
father
went
fishing
jean
with
his
mother
help
was
furnishing
and
settling
himself
pierre
very
gloomy
never
was
seen
excepting
at
his
father
having
asked
him
one
evening
why
the
deuce
do
you
always
come
in
with
a
face
as
cheerful
as
a
funeral
this
is
not
the
first
time
i
have
remarked
the
doctor
replied
the
fact
is
i
am
terribly
conscious
of
the
burden
of
the
old
man
did
not
have
a
notion
what
he
meant
and
with
an
aggrieved
look
he
went
on
it
really
is
too
bad
ever
since
we
had
the
good
luck
to
come
into
this
legacy
every
one
seems
unhappy
it
is
as
though
some
accident
had
befallen
us
as
if
we
were
in
mourning
for
some
i
am
in
mourning
for
some
one
said
pierre
you
are
for
whom
for
some
one
you
never
knew
and
of
whom
i
was
too
roland
imagined
that
his
son
alluded
to
some
girl
with
whom
he
had
had
some
love
passages
and
he
said
a
woman
i
yes
a
dead
no
worse
ruined
ah
though
he
was
startled
by
this
unexpected
confidence
in
his
presence
too
and
by
his
son
strange
tone
about
it
the
old
man
made
no
further
inquiries
for
in
his
opinion
such
affairs
did
not
concern
a
third
person
mme
roland
affected
not
to
hear
she
seemed
ill
and
was
very
pale
several
times
already
her
husband
surprised
to
see
her
sit
down
as
if
she
were
dropping
into
her
chair
and
to
hear
her
gasp
as
if
she
could
not
draw
her
breath
had
said
really
louise
you
look
very
ill
you
tire
yourself
too
much
with
helping
jean
give
yourself
a
little
rest
sacristi
the
rascal
is
in
no
hurry
as
he
is
a
rich
she
shook
her
head
without
a
word
but
her
pallor
was
so
great
that
roland
remarked
on
it
again
come
come
said
he
this
will
not
do
at
all
my
dear
old
woman
you
must
take
care
of
then
addressing
his
son
you
surely
must
see
that
your
mother
is
have
you
questioned
her
at
any
rate
pierre
replied
no
i
had
not
noticed
that
there
was
anything
the
matter
with
at
this
roland
was
angry
but
it
stares
you
in
the
face
confound
you
what
on
earth
is
the
good
of
your
being
a
doctor
if
you
can
not
even
see
that
your
mother
is
out
of
sorts
why
look
at
her
just
look
at
her
really
a
man
might
die
under
his
very
eyes
and
this
doctor
would
never
think
there
was
anything
the
matter
mme
roland
was
panting
for
breath
and
so
white
that
her
husband
exclaimed
she
is
going
to
no
no
it
is
nothing
i
shall
get
better
directly
it
is
pierre
had
gone
up
to
her
and
was
looking
at
her
steadily
what
ails
you
he
said
and
she
repeated
in
an
undertone
nothing
nothing
i
assure
you
roland
had
gone
to
fetch
some
vinegar
he
now
returned
and
handing
the
bottle
to
his
son
he
said
here
do
something
to
ease
her
have
you
felt
her
heart
as
pierre
bent
over
her
to
feel
her
pulse
she
pulled
away
her
hand
so
vehemently
that
she
struck
it
against
a
chair
which
was
standing
by
come
said
he
in
icy
tones
let
me
see
what
i
can
do
for
you
as
you
are
then
she
raised
her
arm
and
held
it
out
to
him
her
skin
was
burning
the
blood
throbbing
in
short
irregular
leaps
you
are
certainly
ill
he
murmured
you
must
take
something
to
quiet
you
i
will
write
you
a
and
as
he
wrote
stooping
over
the
paper
a
low
sound
of
choked
sighs
smothered
quick
breathing
and
suppressed
sobs
made
him
suddenly
look
round
at
her
she
was
weeping
her
hands
covering
her
face
roland
quite
distracted
asked
her
louise
louise
what
is
the
mater
with
you
what
on
earth
ails
you
she
did
not
answer
but
seemed
racked
by
some
deep
and
dreadful
grief
her
husband
tried
to
take
her
hands
from
her
face
but
she
resisted
him
repeating
no
no
he
appealed
to
his
son
but
what
is
the
matter
with
her
i
never
saw
her
like
it
is
nothing
said
pierre
she
is
a
little
and
he
felt
as
if
it
were
a
comfort
to
him
to
see
her
suffering
thus
as
if
this
anguish
mitigated
his
resentment
and
diminished
his
load
of
opprobrium
he
looked
at
her
as
a
judge
satisfied
with
his
work
suddenly
she
rose
rushed
to
the
door
with
such
a
swift
impulse
that
it
was
impossible
to
forestall
or
to
stop
her
and
ran
off
to
lock
herself
into
her
room
roland
and
the
doctor
were
left
face
to
face
can
you
make
head
or
tail
of
it
said
the
father
oh
yes
said
the
other
it
is
a
little
nervous
disturbance
not
alarming
or
surprising
such
attacks
may
very
likely
recur
from
time
to
they
did
in
fact
recur
almost
every
day
and
pierre
seemed
to
bring
them
on
with
a
word
as
if
he
had
the
clew
to
her
strange
and
new
disorder
he
would
discern
in
her
face
a
lucid
interval
of
peace
and
with
the
willingness
of
a
torturer
would
with
a
word
revive
the
anguish
that
had
been
lulled
for
a
moment
but
he
too
was
suffering
as
cruelly
as
she
it
was
dreadful
pain
to
him
that
he
could
no
longer
love
her
nor
respect
her
that
he
must
put
her
on
the
rack
when
he
had
laid
bare
the
bleeding
wound
which
he
had
opened
in
her
woman
her
mother
heart
when
he
felt
how
wretched
and
desperate
she
was
he
would
go
out
alone
wander
about
the
town
so
torn
by
remorse
so
broken
by
pity
so
grieved
to
have
thus
hammered
her
with
his
scorn
as
her
son
that
he
longed
to
fling
himself
into
the
sea
and
put
an
end
to
it
all
by
drowning
himself
ah
how
gladly
now
would
he
have
forgiven
her
but
he
could
not
for
he
was
incapable
of
forgetting
if
only
he
could
have
desisted
from
making
her
suffer
but
this
again
he
could
not
suffering
as
he
did
himself
he
went
home
to
his
meals
full
of
relenting
resolutions
then
as
soon
as
he
saw
her
as
soon
as
he
met
her
eye
formerly
so
clear
and
frank
now
so
evasive
frightened
and
bewildered
he
struck
at
her
in
spite
of
himself
unable
to
suppress
the
treacherous
words
which
would
rise
to
his
lips
this
disgraceful
secret
known
to
them
alone
goaded
him
up
against
her
it
was
as
a
poison
flowing
in
his
veins
and
giving
him
an
impulse
to
bite
like
a
mad
dog
and
there
was
no
one
in
the
way
now
to
hinder
his
reading
her
jean
lived
almost
entirely
in
his
new
apartments
and
only
came
home
to
dinner
and
to
sleep
every
night
at
his
father
he
frequently
observed
his
brother
bitterness
and
violence
and
attributed
them
to
jealousy
he
promised
himself
that
some
day
he
would
teach
him
his
place
and
give
him
a
lesson
for
life
at
home
was
becoming
very
painful
as
a
result
of
these
constant
scenes
but
as
he
now
lived
apart
he
suffered
less
from
this
brutal
conduct
and
his
love
of
peace
prompted
him
to
patience
his
good
fortune
too
had
turned
his
head
and
he
scarcely
paused
to
think
of
anything
which
had
no
direct
interest
for
himself
he
would
come
in
full
of
fresh
little
anxieties
full
of
the
cut
of
a
of
the
shape
of
a
felt
hat
of
the
proper
size
for
his
and
he
talked
incessantly
of
all
the
details
of
his
house
the
shelves
fixed
in
his
cupboard
to
keep
linen
on
the
pegs
to
be
put
up
in
the
entrance
hall
the
electric
bells
contrived
to
prevent
illicit
visitors
to
his
lodgings
it
had
been
settled
that
on
the
day
when
he
should
take
up
his
abode
there
they
should
make
an
excursion
to
saint
jouin
and
return
after
dining
there
to
drink
tea
in
his
rooms
roland
wanted
to
go
by
water
but
the
distance
and
the
uncertainty
of
reaching
it
in
a
sailing
boat
if
there
should
be
a
made
them
reject
his
plan
and
a
break
was
hired
for
the
day
they
set
out
at
ten
to
get
there
to
breakfast
the
dusty
high
road
lay
across
the
plain
of
normandy
which
by
its
gentle
undulations
dotted
with
farms
embowered
in
trees
wears
the
aspect
of
an
endless
park
in
the
vehicle
as
it
jogged
on
at
the
slow
trot
of
a
pair
of
heavy
horses
sat
the
four
rolands
mme
rosemilly
and
captain
beausire
all
silent
deafened
by
the
rumble
of
the
wheels
and
with
their
eyes
shut
to
keep
out
the
clouds
of
dust
it
was
alternating
with
the
dark
hue
of
clover
and
the
raw
green
of
the
yellow
corn
lighted
up
the
landscape
with
gleams
of
pale
gold
the
fields
looked
as
if
they
had
drunk
in
the
sunshine
which
poured
down
on
them
here
and
there
the
reapers
were
at
work
and
in
the
plots
where
the
scythe
had
been
put
in
the
men
might
be
seen
as
they
swept
the
level
soil
with
the
broad
blade
after
a
drive
the
break
turned
off
to
the
left
past
a
windmill
at
work
a
melancholy
gray
wreck
half
rotten
and
doomed
the
last
survivor
of
its
ancient
race
then
it
went
into
a
pretty
inn
yard
and
drew
up
at
the
door
of
a
smart
little
house
a
hostelry
famous
in
those
parts
the
mistress
well
known
as
la
belle
alphonsine
came
smiling
to
the
threshold
and
held
out
her
hand
to
the
two
ladies
who
hesitated
to
take
the
high
step
some
strangers
were
already
at
breakfast
under
a
tent
by
a
shaded
by
apple
trees
parisians
who
had
come
from
etretat
and
from
the
house
came
sounds
of
voices
laughter
and
the
clatter
of
plates
and
pans
they
were
to
eat
in
a
room
as
the
outer
were
all
full
roland
suddenly
caught
sight
of
some
shrimping
nets
hanging
against
the
wall
ah
ha
cried
he
you
catch
prawns
here
yes
replied
beausire
indeed
it
is
the
place
on
all
the
coast
where
most
are
suppose
we
try
to
catch
some
after
as
it
happened
it
would
be
low
tide
at
three
so
it
was
settled
that
they
should
all
spend
the
afternoon
among
the
rocks
hunting
prawns
they
made
a
light
breakfast
as
a
precaution
against
the
tendency
of
blood
to
the
head
when
they
should
have
their
feet
in
the
water
they
also
wished
to
reserve
an
appetite
for
dinner
which
had
been
ordered
on
a
grand
scale
and
to
be
ready
at
six
when
they
came
in
roland
could
not
sit
still
for
impatience
he
wanted
to
buy
the
nets
specially
constructed
for
fishing
prawns
not
unlike
those
used
for
catching
butterflies
in
the
country
their
name
on
the
french
coast
is
they
are
netted
bags
on
a
circular
wooden
frame
at
the
end
of
a
long
pole
alphonsine
still
smiling
was
happy
to
lend
them
then
she
helped
the
two
ladies
to
make
an
impromptu
change
of
toilet
so
as
not
to
spoil
their
dresses
she
offered
them
skirts
coarse
worsted
stockings
and
hemp
shoes
the
men
took
off
their
socks
and
went
to
the
shoemaker
to
buy
wooden
shoes
instead
then
they
set
out
the
nets
over
their
shoulders
and
creels
on
their
backs
mme
rosemilly
was
very
sweet
in
this
costume
with
an
unexpected
charm
of
countrified
audacity
the
skirt
which
alphonsine
had
lent
her
coquettishly
tucked
up
and
firmly
stitched
so
as
to
allow
of
her
running
and
jumping
fearlessly
on
the
rocks
displayed
her
ankle
and
lower
calf
the
firm
calf
of
a
strong
and
agile
little
woman
her
dress
was
loose
to
give
freedom
to
her
movements
and
to
cover
her
head
she
had
found
an
enormous
garden
hat
of
coarse
yellow
straw
with
an
extravagantly
broad
brim
and
to
this
a
bunch
of
tamarisk
pinned
in
to
cock
it
on
one
side
gave
a
very
dashing
and
military
effect
jean
since
he
had
come
into
his
fortune
had
asked
himself
every
day
whether
or
no
he
should
marry
her
each
time
he
saw
her
he
made
up
his
mind
to
ask
her
to
be
his
wife
and
then
as
soon
as
he
was
alone
again
he
considered
that
by
waiting
he
would
have
time
to
reflect
she
was
now
less
rich
than
he
for
she
had
but
twelve
thousand
francs
a
year
but
it
was
in
real
estate
in
farms
and
lands
near
the
docks
in
havre
and
this
might
be
worth
a
great
deal
their
fortunes
were
thus
approximately
equal
and
certainly
the
young
widow
attracted
him
greatly
as
he
watched
her
walking
in
front
of
him
that
day
he
said
to
himself
i
must
really
decide
i
can
not
do
better
i
am
they
went
down
a
little
ravine
sloping
from
the
village
to
the
cliff
and
the
cliff
at
the
end
of
this
comb
rose
about
eighty
metres
above
the
sea
framed
between
the
green
slopes
to
the
right
and
left
a
great
triangle
of
silvery
blue
water
could
be
seen
in
the
distance
and
a
sail
scarcely
visible
looked
like
an
insect
out
there
the
sky
pale
with
light
was
so
merged
into
one
with
the
water
that
it
was
impossible
to
see
where
one
ended
and
the
other
began
and
the
two
women
walking
in
front
of
the
men
stood
out
against
the
bright
background
their
shapes
clearly
defined
in
their
dresses
jean
with
a
sparkle
in
his
eye
watched
the
smart
ankle
the
neat
leg
the
supple
waist
and
the
coquettish
broad
hat
of
mme
rosemilly
as
they
fled
away
from
him
and
this
flight
fired
his
ardour
urging
him
on
to
the
sudden
determination
which
comes
to
hesitating
and
timid
natures
the
warm
air
fragrant
with
odours
gorse
clover
and
thyme
mingling
with
the
salt
smell
of
the
rocks
at
low
tide
excited
him
still
more
mounting
to
his
brain
and
every
moment
he
felt
a
little
more
determined
at
every
step
at
every
glance
he
cast
at
the
alert
figure
he
made
up
his
mind
to
delay
no
longer
to
tell
her
that
he
loved
her
and
hoped
to
marry
her
the
would
favour
him
by
affording
him
an
opportunity
and
it
would
be
a
pretty
scene
too
a
pretty
spot
for
their
feet
in
a
pool
of
limpid
water
while
they
watched
the
long
feelers
of
the
shrimps
lurking
under
the
wrack
when
they
had
reached
the
end
of
the
comb
and
the
edge
of
the
cliff
they
saw
a
little
footpath
slanting
down
the
face
of
it
and
below
them
about
between
the
sea
and
the
foot
of
the
precipice
an
amazing
chaos
of
enormous
boulders
tumbled
over
and
piled
one
above
the
other
on
a
sort
of
grassy
and
undulating
plain
which
extended
as
far
as
they
could
see
to
the
southward
formed
by
an
ancient
landslip
on
this
long
shelf
of
brushwood
and
grass
disrupted
as
it
seemed
by
the
shocks
of
a
volcano
the
fallen
rocks
seemed
the
wreck
of
a
great
ruined
city
which
had
once
looked
out
on
the
ocean
sheltered
by
the
long
white
wall
of
the
overhanging
cliff
that
is
fine
exclaimed
mme
rosemilly
standing
still
jean
had
come
up
with
her
and
with
a
beating
heart
offered
his
hand
to
help
her
down
the
narrow
steps
cut
in
the
rock
they
went
on
in
front
while
beausire
squaring
himself
on
his
little
legs
gave
his
arm
to
mme
roland
who
felt
giddy
at
the
gulf
before
her
roland
and
pierre
came
last
and
the
doctor
had
to
drag
his
father
down
for
his
brain
reeled
so
that
he
could
only
slip
down
sitting
from
step
to
step
the
two
young
people
who
led
the
way
went
fast
till
on
a
sudden
they
saw
by
the
side
of
a
wooden
bench
which
afforded
a
about
down
the
slope
a
thread
of
clear
water
springing
from
a
crevice
in
the
cliff
it
fell
into
a
hollow
as
large
as
a
washing
basin
which
it
had
worn
in
the
stone
then
falling
in
a
cascade
hardly
two
feet
high
it
trickled
across
the
footpath
which
it
had
carpeted
with
cresses
and
was
lost
among
the
briers
and
grass
on
the
raised
shelf
where
the
boulders
were
piled
oh
i
am
so
thirsty
cried
mme
rosemilly
but
how
could
she
drink
she
tried
to
catch
the
water
in
her
hand
but
it
slipped
away
between
her
fingers
jean
had
an
idea
he
placed
a
stone
on
the
path
and
on
this
she
knelt
down
to
put
her
lips
to
the
spring
itself
which
was
thus
on
the
same
level
when
she
raised
her
head
covered
with
myriads
of
tiny
drops
sprinkled
all
over
her
face
her
hair
her
and
her
dress
jean
bent
over
her
and
murmured
how
pretty
you
look
she
answered
in
the
tone
in
which
she
might
have
scolded
a
child
will
you
be
quiet
these
were
the
first
words
of
flirtation
they
had
ever
exchanged
come
said
jean
much
agitated
let
us
go
on
before
they
come
up
with
for
in
fact
they
could
see
quite
near
them
now
captain
beausire
as
he
came
down
backward
so
as
to
give
both
hands
to
mme
roland
and
further
up
further
off
roland
still
letting
himself
slip
lowering
himself
on
his
hams
and
clinging
on
with
his
hands
and
elbows
at
the
speed
of
a
tortoise
pierre
keeping
in
front
of
him
to
watch
his
movements
the
path
now
less
steep
was
here
almost
a
road
zigzagging
between
the
huge
rocks
which
had
at
some
former
time
rolled
from
the
mme
rosemilly
and
jean
set
off
at
a
run
and
they
were
soon
on
the
beach
they
crossed
it
and
reached
the
rocks
which
stretched
in
a
long
and
flat
expanse
covered
with
and
broken
by
endless
gleaming
pools
the
ebbed
waters
lay
beyond
very
far
away
across
this
plain
of
slimy
weed
of
a
black
and
shining
olive
green
jean
rolled
up
his
trousers
above
his
calf
and
his
sleeves
to
his
elbows
that
he
might
get
wet
without
caring
then
saying
forward
he
leaped
boldly
into
the
first
they
came
to
the
lady
more
cautious
though
fully
intending
to
go
in
too
presently
made
her
way
round
the
little
pond
stepping
timidly
for
she
slipped
on
the
grassy
weed
do
you
see
anything
she
asked
yes
i
see
your
face
reflected
in
the
if
that
is
all
you
see
you
will
not
have
good
he
murmured
tenderly
in
reply
of
all
fishing
it
is
that
i
should
like
best
to
succeed
she
laughed
try
you
will
see
how
it
will
slip
through
your
but
yet
if
you
will
i
will
see
you
catch
prawns
and
nothing
else
for
the
you
are
cruel
let
us
go
a
little
farther
there
are
none
he
gave
her
his
hand
to
steady
her
on
the
slippery
rocks
she
leaned
on
him
rather
timidly
and
he
suddenly
felt
himself
overpowered
by
love
and
insurgent
with
passion
as
if
the
fever
that
had
been
incubating
in
him
had
waited
till
to
declare
its
presence
they
soon
came
to
a
deeper
rift
in
which
long
slender
weeds
fantastically
tinted
like
floating
green
and
hair
were
swaying
under
the
quivering
water
as
it
trickled
off
to
the
distant
sea
through
some
invisible
crevice
mme
rosemilly
cried
out
look
look
i
see
one
a
big
one
a
very
big
one
just
there
he
saw
it
too
and
stepped
boldly
into
the
pool
though
he
got
wet
up
to
the
waist
but
the
creature
waving
its
long
whiskers
gently
retired
in
front
of
the
net
jean
drove
it
towards
the
making
sure
of
his
prey
when
it
found
itself
blockaded
it
rose
with
a
dart
over
the
net
shot
across
the
mere
and
was
gone
the
young
woman
who
was
watching
the
chase
in
great
excitement
could
not
help
exclaiming
oh
clumsy
he
was
vexed
and
without
a
moment
thought
dragged
his
net
over
a
hole
full
of
weed
as
he
brought
it
to
the
surface
again
he
saw
in
it
three
large
transparent
prawns
caught
blindfold
in
their
he
offered
them
in
triumph
to
mme
rosemilly
who
was
afraid
to
touch
them
for
fear
of
the
sharp
serrated
crest
which
arms
their
heads
however
she
made
up
her
mind
to
it
and
taking
them
up
by
the
tip
of
their
long
whiskers
she
dropped
them
one
by
one
into
her
creel
with
a
little
seaweed
to
keep
them
alive
then
having
found
a
shallower
pool
of
water
she
stepped
in
with
some
hesitation
for
the
cold
plunge
of
her
feet
took
her
breath
away
and
began
to
fish
on
her
own
account
she
was
dextrous
and
artful
with
the
light
hand
and
the
hunter
instinct
which
are
indispensable
at
almost
every
dip
she
brought
up
some
prawns
beguiled
and
surprised
by
her
ingeniously
gentle
pursuit
jean
now
caught
nothing
but
he
followed
her
step
by
step
touched
her
now
and
again
bent
over
her
pretended
great
distress
at
his
own
awkwardness
and
besought
her
to
teach
him
show
me
he
kept
saying
show
me
and
then
as
their
two
faces
were
reflected
side
by
side
in
water
so
clear
that
the
black
weeds
at
the
bottom
made
a
mirror
jean
smiled
at
the
face
which
looked
up
at
him
from
the
depth
and
now
and
then
from
his
blew
it
a
kiss
which
seemed
to
light
upon
it
oh
how
tiresome
you
are
she
exclaimed
my
dear
fellow
you
should
never
do
two
things
at
he
replied
i
am
only
doing
one
loving
she
drew
herself
up
and
said
gravely
what
has
come
over
you
these
ten
minutes
have
you
lost
your
wits
no
i
have
not
lost
my
wits
i
love
you
and
at
last
i
dare
to
tell
you
they
were
at
this
moment
both
standing
in
the
salt
pool
wet
up
to
their
knees
and
with
dripping
hands
holding
their
nets
they
looked
into
each
other
eyes
she
went
on
in
a
tone
of
amused
annoyance
how
very
to
tell
me
here
and
now
could
you
not
wait
till
another
day
instead
of
spoiling
my
fishing
forgive
me
he
murmured
but
i
could
not
longer
hold
my
peace
i
have
loved
you
a
long
time
you
have
intoxicated
me
and
i
lost
my
then
suddenly
she
seemed
to
have
resigned
herself
to
talk
business
and
think
no
more
of
pleasure
let
us
sit
down
on
that
stone
said
she
we
can
talk
more
they
scrambled
up
a
rather
high
boulder
and
when
they
had
settled
themselves
side
by
side
in
the
bright
sunshine
she
began
again
my
good
friend
you
are
no
longer
a
child
and
i
am
not
a
young
girl
we
both
know
perfectly
well
what
we
are
about
and
we
can
weigh
the
consequences
of
our
actions
if
you
have
made
up
your
mind
to
make
love
to
me
i
must
naturally
infer
that
you
wish
to
marry
he
was
not
prepared
for
this
statement
of
the
case
and
he
answered
blandly
why
have
you
mentioned
it
to
your
father
and
mother
no
i
wanted
to
know
first
whether
you
would
accept
she
held
out
her
hand
which
was
still
wet
and
as
he
eagerly
clasped
it
i
am
ready
and
willing
she
said
i
believe
you
to
be
kind
and
but
remember
i
should
not
like
to
displease
your
oh
do
you
think
that
my
mother
has
never
foreseen
it
or
that
she
would
not
be
as
fond
of
you
as
she
is
if
she
did
not
hope
that
you
and
i
should
marry
that
is
true
i
am
a
little
they
said
no
more
he
for
his
part
was
amazed
at
her
being
so
little
disturbed
so
rational
he
had
expected
pretty
little
flirting
ways
refusals
which
meant
yes
a
whole
coquettish
comedy
of
love
chequered
by
in
the
splashing
water
and
it
was
all
over
he
was
pledged
married
with
twenty
words
they
had
no
more
to
say
about
it
since
they
were
agreed
and
they
now
sat
both
somewhat
embarrassed
by
what
had
so
swiftly
passed
between
them
a
little
perplexed
indeed
not
daring
to
speak
not
daring
to
fish
not
knowing
what
to
do
roland
voice
rescued
them
this
way
this
way
children
come
and
watch
beausire
the
fellow
is
positively
clearing
out
the
sea
the
captain
had
in
fact
had
a
wonderful
haul
wet
above
his
hips
he
waded
from
pool
to
pool
recognizing
the
likeliest
spots
at
a
glance
and
searching
all
the
hollows
hidden
under
with
a
steady
slow
sweep
of
his
net
and
the
beautiful
transparent
prawns
skipped
in
his
palm
as
he
picked
them
out
of
the
net
with
a
dry
jerk
and
put
them
into
his
creel
mme
rosemilly
surprised
and
delighted
remained
at
his
side
almost
forgetful
of
her
promise
to
jean
who
followed
them
in
a
dream
giving
herself
up
entirely
to
the
childish
enjoyment
of
pulling
the
creatures
out
from
among
the
waving
roland
suddenly
exclaimed
ah
here
comes
mme
roland
to
join
she
had
remained
at
first
on
the
beach
with
pierre
for
they
had
neither
of
them
any
wish
to
play
at
running
about
among
the
rocks
and
paddling
in
the
and
yet
they
had
felt
doubtful
about
staying
together
she
was
afraid
of
him
and
her
son
was
afraid
of
her
and
of
himself
afraid
of
his
own
cruelty
which
he
could
not
control
but
they
sat
down
side
by
side
on
the
stones
and
both
of
them
under
the
heat
of
the
sun
mitigated
by
the
gazing
at
the
wide
fair
horizon
of
blue
water
streaked
and
shot
with
silver
thought
as
if
in
unison
how
delightful
this
would
have
been
she
did
not
venture
to
speak
to
pierre
knowing
that
he
would
return
some
hard
answer
and
he
dared
not
address
his
mother
knowing
that
in
spite
of
himself
he
should
speak
violently
he
sat
twitching
the
pebbles
with
the
end
of
his
cane
switching
them
and
turning
them
over
she
with
a
vague
look
in
her
eyes
had
picked
up
three
or
four
little
stones
and
was
slowly
and
mechanically
dropping
them
from
one
hand
into
the
other
then
her
unsettled
gaze
wandering
over
the
scene
before
her
discerned
among
the
weedy
rocks
her
son
jean
fishing
with
mme
rosemilly
she
looked
at
them
watching
their
movements
dimly
understanding
with
motherly
instinct
that
they
were
talking
as
they
did
not
talk
every
day
she
saw
them
leaning
over
side
by
side
when
they
looked
into
the
water
standing
face
to
face
when
they
questioned
their
hearts
then
scrambled
up
the
rock
and
seated
themselves
to
come
to
an
understanding
their
figures
stood
out
very
sharply
looking
as
if
they
were
alone
in
the
middle
of
the
wide
horizon
and
assuming
a
sort
of
symbolic
dignity
in
that
vast
expanse
of
sky
and
sea
and
cliff
pierre
too
was
looking
at
them
and
a
harsh
laugh
suddenly
broke
form
his
lips
without
turning
to
him
mme
roland
said
what
is
it
he
spoke
with
a
sneer
i
am
learning
learning
how
a
man
lays
himself
out
to
be
cozened
by
his
she
flushed
with
rage
exasperated
by
the
insinuation
she
believed
was
intended
in
whose
name
do
you
say
that
in
jean
by
heaven
it
is
immensely
funny
to
see
those
she
murmured
in
a
low
voice
tremulous
with
feeling
o
pierre
how
cruel
you
are
that
woman
is
honesty
itself
your
brother
could
not
find
a
he
laughed
aloud
a
hard
satirical
laugh
ha
hah
hah
honesty
itself
all
wives
are
honesty
itself
and
all
husbands
are
and
he
shouted
with
laughter
she
made
no
reply
but
rose
hastily
went
down
the
sloping
beach
and
at
the
risk
of
tumbling
into
one
of
the
rifts
hidden
by
the
of
breaking
a
leg
or
an
arm
she
hastened
almost
running
plunging
through
the
pools
without
looking
straight
to
her
other
son
seeing
her
approach
jean
called
out
well
mother
so
you
have
made
the
effort
without
a
word
she
seized
him
by
the
arm
as
if
to
say
save
me
protect
me
he
saw
her
agitation
and
greatly
surprised
he
said
how
pale
you
are
what
is
the
matter
she
stammered
out
i
was
nearly
falling
i
was
frightened
at
the
so
then
jean
guided
her
supported
her
explained
the
sport
to
her
that
she
might
take
an
interest
in
it
but
as
she
scarcely
heeded
him
and
as
he
was
bursting
with
the
desire
to
confide
in
some
one
he
led
her
away
and
in
a
low
voice
said
to
her
guess
what
i
have
done
but
what
i
do
i
can
not
i
do
well
i
have
told
mme
rosemilly
that
i
wish
to
marry
she
did
not
answer
for
her
brain
was
buzzing
her
mind
in
such
distress
that
she
could
scarcely
take
it
in
she
echoed
marry
her
yes
have
i
done
well
she
is
charming
do
not
you
think
yes
charming
you
have
done
very
then
you
approve
yes
i
but
how
strangely
you
say
so
i
could
fancy
that
that
you
were
not
yes
indeed
i
am
very
really
and
truly
really
and
and
to
prove
it
she
threw
her
arms
round
him
and
kissed
him
heartily
with
warm
motherly
kisses
then
when
she
had
wiped
her
eyes
which
were
full
of
tears
she
observed
upon
the
beach
a
man
lying
flat
at
full
length
like
a
dead
body
his
face
hidden
against
the
stones
it
was
the
other
one
pierre
sunk
in
thought
and
desperation
at
this
she
led
her
little
jean
farther
away
quite
to
the
edge
of
the
waves
and
there
they
talked
for
a
long
time
of
this
marriage
on
which
he
had
set
his
heart
the
rising
tide
drove
them
back
to
rejoin
the
fishers
and
then
they
all
made
their
way
to
the
shore
they
roused
pierre
who
pretended
to
be
sleeping
and
then
came
a
long
dinner
washed
down
with
many
kinds
of
wine
chapter
vii
in
the
break
on
their
way
home
all
the
men
dozed
excepting
jean
beausire
and
roland
dropped
every
five
minutes
on
to
a
shoulder
which
repelled
them
with
a
shove
then
they
sat
up
ceased
to
snore
opened
their
eyes
muttered
a
lovely
evening
and
almost
immediately
fell
over
on
the
other
side
by
the
time
they
reached
havre
their
drowsiness
was
so
heavy
that
they
had
great
difficulty
in
shaking
it
off
and
beausire
even
refused
to
go
to
jean
rooms
where
tea
was
waiting
for
them
he
had
to
be
set
down
at
his
own
door
the
young
lawyer
was
to
sleep
in
his
new
abode
for
the
first
time
and
he
was
full
of
rather
puerile
glee
which
had
suddenly
come
over
him
at
being
able
that
very
evening
to
show
his
betrothed
the
rooms
she
was
so
soon
to
inhabit
the
maid
had
gone
to
bed
mme
roland
having
declared
that
she
herself
would
boil
the
water
and
make
the
tea
for
she
did
not
like
the
servants
to
be
kept
up
for
fear
of
fire
no
one
had
yet
been
into
the
lodgings
but
herself
jean
and
the
workmen
that
the
surprise
might
be
the
greater
at
their
being
so
pretty
jean
begged
them
all
to
wait
a
moment
in
the
he
wanted
to
light
the
lamps
and
candles
and
he
left
mme
rosemilly
in
the
dark
with
his
father
and
brother
then
he
cried
come
in
opening
the
double
door
to
its
full
width
the
glass
gallery
lighted
by
a
chandelier
and
little
coloured
lamps
hidden
among
palms
plants
and
flowers
was
first
seen
like
a
scene
on
the
stage
there
was
a
spasm
of
surprise
roland
dazzled
by
such
luxury
muttered
an
oath
and
felt
inclined
to
clap
his
hands
as
if
it
were
a
pantomime
scene
they
then
went
into
the
first
a
small
room
hung
with
dead
gold
and
furnished
to
match
the
larger
the
lawyer
very
simple
hung
with
light
was
dignified
in
style
jean
sat
down
in
his
in
front
of
his
loaded
with
books
and
in
a
solemn
rather
stilted
tone
he
began
yes
madame
the
letter
of
the
law
is
explicit
and
assuming
the
consent
i
promised
you
it
affords
me
absolute
certainty
that
the
matter
we
discussed
will
come
to
a
happy
conclusion
within
three
he
looked
at
mme
rosemilly
who
began
to
smile
and
glanced
at
mme
roland
mme
roland
took
her
hand
and
pressed
it
jean
in
high
spirits
cut
a
caper
like
a
exclaiming
hah
how
well
the
voice
carries
in
this
room
it
would
be
capital
for
speaking
and
he
declaimed
if
humanity
alone
if
the
instinct
of
natural
benevolence
which
we
feel
towards
all
who
suffer
were
the
motive
of
the
acquittal
we
expect
of
you
i
should
appeal
to
your
compassion
gentlemen
of
the
jury
to
your
hearts
as
fathers
and
as
men
but
we
have
law
on
our
side
and
it
is
the
point
of
law
only
which
we
shall
submit
to
your
pierre
was
looking
at
this
home
which
might
have
been
his
and
he
was
restive
under
his
brother
frolics
thinking
him
really
too
silly
and
witless
mme
roland
opened
a
door
on
the
right
this
is
the
said
she
she
had
devoted
herself
to
its
decoration
with
all
her
mother
love
the
hangings
were
of
rouen
cretonne
imitating
old
normandy
chintz
and
the
louis
xv
design
a
shepherdess
in
a
medallion
held
in
the
beaks
of
a
pair
of
doves
gave
the
walls
curtains
bed
and
a
festive
rustic
style
that
was
extremely
pretty
oh
how
charming
mme
rosemilly
exclaimed
becoming
a
little
serious
as
they
entered
the
room
do
you
like
it
asked
jean
you
can
not
imagine
how
glad
i
they
looked
at
each
other
for
a
second
with
confiding
tenderness
in
the
depths
of
their
eyes
she
had
felt
a
little
awkward
however
a
little
abashed
in
this
room
which
was
to
be
hers
she
noticed
as
she
went
in
that
the
bed
was
a
large
one
quite
a
family
bed
chosen
by
mme
roland
who
had
no
doubt
foreseen
and
hoped
that
her
son
should
soon
marry
and
this
motherly
foresight
pleased
her
for
it
seemed
to
tell
her
that
she
was
expected
in
the
family
when
they
had
returned
to
the
jean
abruptly
threw
open
the
door
to
the
left
showing
the
circular
with
three
windows
and
decorated
to
imitate
a
chinese
lantern
mother
and
son
had
here
lavished
all
the
fancy
of
which
they
were
capable
and
the
room
with
its
bamboo
furniture
its
mandarins
jars
silk
hangings
glistening
with
gold
transparent
blinds
threaded
with
beads
looking
like
drops
of
water
fans
nailed
to
the
wall
to
drape
the
hangings
on
screens
swords
masks
cranes
made
of
real
feathers
and
a
myriad
trifles
in
china
wood
paper
ivory
and
bronze
had
the
pretentious
and
extravagant
aspect
which
unpractised
hands
and
uneducated
eyes
inevitably
stamp
on
things
which
need
the
utmost
tact
taste
and
artistic
education
nevertheless
it
was
the
most
admired
only
pierre
made
some
observations
with
rather
bitter
irony
which
hurt
his
brother
feelings
pyramids
of
fruit
stood
on
the
table
and
monuments
of
cakes
no
one
was
hungry
they
picked
at
the
fruit
and
nibbled
at
the
cakes
rather
than
ate
them
then
at
the
end
of
about
an
hour
mme
rosemilly
begged
to
take
leave
it
was
decided
that
old
roland
should
accompany
her
home
and
set
out
with
her
forthwith
while
mme
roland
in
the
maid
absence
should
cast
a
maternal
eye
over
the
house
and
see
that
her
son
had
all
he
needed
shall
i
come
back
for
you
asked
roland
she
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
said
no
dear
old
man
go
to
bed
pierre
will
see
me
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
she
blew
out
the
candles
locked
up
the
cakes
the
sugar
and
liqueurs
in
a
cupboard
of
which
she
gave
the
key
to
jean
then
she
went
into
the
turned
down
the
bed
saw
that
there
was
fresh
water
in
the
and
that
the
window
was
properly
closed
pierre
and
jean
had
remained
in
the
little
outer
the
younger
still
sore
under
the
criticism
passed
on
his
taste
and
the
elder
chafing
more
and
more
at
seeing
his
brother
in
this
abode
they
both
sat
smoking
without
a
word
pierre
suddenly
started
to
his
feet
cristi
he
exclaimed
the
widow
looked
very
jaded
this
evening
long
excursions
do
not
improve
jean
felt
his
spirit
rising
with
one
of
those
sudden
and
furious
rages
which
boil
up
in
natures
when
they
are
wounded
to
the
quick
he
could
hardly
find
breath
to
speak
so
fierce
was
his
excitement
and
he
stammered
out
i
forbid
you
ever
again
to
say
widow
when
you
speak
of
mme
pierre
turned
on
him
haughtily
you
are
giving
me
an
order
i
believe
are
you
gone
mad
by
any
chance
jean
had
pulled
himself
up
i
am
not
gone
mad
but
i
have
had
enough
of
your
manners
to
pierre
sneered
to
you
and
are
you
any
part
of
mme
rosemilly
you
are
to
know
that
mme
rosemilly
is
about
to
become
my
pierre
laughed
the
louder
ah
ha
very
good
i
understand
now
why
i
should
no
longer
speak
of
her
as
widow
but
you
have
taken
a
strange
way
of
announcing
your
i
forbid
any
jesting
about
it
do
you
hear
i
forbid
jean
had
come
close
up
to
him
pale
and
his
voice
quivering
with
exasperation
at
this
irony
levelled
at
the
woman
he
loved
and
had
chosen
but
on
a
sudden
pierre
turned
equally
furious
all
the
accumulation
of
impotent
rage
of
suppressed
malignity
of
rebellion
choked
down
for
so
long
past
all
his
unspoken
despair
mounted
to
his
brain
bewildering
it
like
a
fit
how
dare
you
how
dare
you
i
order
you
to
hold
your
tongue
do
you
hear
i
order
jean
startled
by
his
violence
was
silent
for
a
few
seconds
trying
in
the
confusion
of
mind
which
comes
of
rage
to
hit
on
the
thing
the
phrase
the
word
which
might
stab
his
brother
to
the
heart
he
went
on
with
an
effort
to
control
himself
that
he
might
aim
true
and
to
speak
slowly
that
the
words
might
hit
more
keenly
i
have
known
for
a
long
time
that
you
were
jealous
of
me
ever
since
the
day
when
you
first
began
to
talk
of
widow
because
you
knew
it
annoyed
pierre
broke
into
one
of
those
strident
and
scornful
laughs
which
were
common
with
him
ah
ah
good
heavens
jealous
of
you
i
i
and
of
what
good
god
of
your
person
or
your
mind
but
jean
knew
full
well
that
he
had
touched
the
wound
in
his
soul
yes
jealous
of
me
jealous
from
your
childhood
up
and
it
became
fury
when
you
saw
that
this
woman
liked
me
best
and
would
have
nothing
to
say
to
pierre
stung
to
the
quick
by
this
assumption
stuttered
out
i
i
jealous
of
you
and
for
the
sake
of
that
goose
that
gaby
that
simpleton
jean
seeing
that
he
was
aiming
true
went
on
and
how
about
the
day
when
you
tried
to
pull
me
round
in
the
pearl
and
all
you
said
in
her
presence
to
show
off
why
you
are
bursting
with
jealousy
and
when
this
money
was
left
to
me
you
were
maddened
you
hated
me
you
showed
it
in
every
possible
way
and
made
every
one
suffer
for
it
not
an
hour
passes
that
you
do
not
spit
out
the
bile
that
is
choking
pierre
clenched
his
fist
in
his
fury
with
an
almost
irresistible
impulse
to
fly
at
his
brother
and
seize
him
by
the
throat
hold
your
tongue
he
cried
at
least
say
nothing
about
that
jean
went
on
why
your
jealousy
oozes
out
at
every
pore
you
never
say
a
word
to
my
father
my
mother
or
me
that
does
not
declare
it
plainly
you
pretend
to
despise
me
because
you
are
jealous
you
try
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
every
one
because
you
are
jealous
and
now
that
i
am
rich
you
can
no
longer
contain
yourself
you
have
become
venomous
you
torture
our
poor
mother
as
if
she
were
to
blame
pierre
had
retired
step
by
step
as
far
as
the
his
mouth
half
open
his
eyes
glaring
a
prey
to
one
of
those
mad
fits
of
passion
in
which
a
crime
is
committed
he
said
again
in
a
lower
tone
gasping
for
breath
hold
your
tongue
for
god
sake
hold
your
tongue
no
for
a
long
time
i
have
been
wanting
to
give
you
my
whole
mind
you
have
given
me
an
opening
so
much
the
worse
for
you
i
love
the
woman
you
know
it
and
laugh
her
to
scorn
in
my
presence
so
much
the
worse
for
you
but
i
will
break
your
viper
fangs
i
tell
you
i
will
make
you
treat
me
with
with
respect
you
yes
respect
you
you
who
have
brought
shame
on
us
all
by
your
you
say
say
it
again
i
say
that
it
does
not
do
to
accept
one
man
fortune
when
another
is
reputed
to
be
your
jean
stood
rigid
not
understanding
dazed
by
the
insinuation
he
scented
what
repeat
that
once
i
say
what
everybody
is
muttering
what
every
gossip
is
blabbing
that
you
are
the
son
of
the
man
who
left
you
his
fortune
well
then
a
decent
man
does
not
take
the
money
which
brings
dishonour
on
his
pierre
pierre
pierre
think
what
you
are
saying
you
is
it
you
who
give
utterance
to
this
infamous
thing
yes
i
it
is
i
have
you
not
seen
me
crushed
with
woe
this
month
past
spending
my
nights
without
sleep
and
my
days
in
lurking
out
of
sight
like
an
animal
i
hardly
know
what
i
am
doing
or
what
will
become
of
me
so
miserable
am
i
so
crazed
with
shame
and
grief
for
first
i
guessed
and
now
i
know
pierre
be
silent
mother
is
in
the
next
room
remember
she
may
hear
she
must
but
pierre
felt
that
he
must
unburden
his
heart
he
told
jean
all
his
suspicions
his
arguments
his
struggles
his
assurance
and
the
history
of
the
portrait
which
had
again
disappeared
he
spoke
in
short
broken
sentences
almost
without
coherence
the
language
of
a
he
seemed
to
have
quite
forgotten
jean
and
his
mother
in
the
adjoining
room
he
talked
as
if
no
one
were
listening
because
he
must
talk
because
he
had
suffered
too
much
and
smothered
and
closed
the
wound
too
tightly
it
had
festered
like
an
abscess
and
the
abscess
had
burst
splashing
every
one
he
was
pacing
the
room
in
the
way
he
almost
always
did
his
eyes
fixed
on
vacancy
gesticulating
in
a
frenzy
of
despair
his
voice
choked
with
tearless
sobs
and
revulsions
of
he
spoke
as
if
he
were
making
a
confession
of
his
own
misery
and
that
of
his
nearest
kin
as
though
he
were
casting
his
woes
to
the
deaf
invisible
winds
which
bore
away
his
words
jean
distracted
and
almost
convinced
on
a
sudden
by
his
brother
blind
vehemence
was
leaning
against
the
door
behind
which
as
he
guessed
their
mother
had
heard
them
she
could
not
get
out
she
must
come
through
his
room
she
had
not
come
then
it
was
because
she
dare
not
suddenly
pierre
stamped
his
foot
i
am
a
brute
he
cried
to
have
told
you
and
he
fled
down
the
stairs
the
noise
of
the
closing
with
a
slam
roused
jean
from
the
deep
stupor
into
which
he
had
fallen
some
seconds
had
elapsed
longer
than
hours
and
his
spirit
had
sunk
into
the
numb
torpor
of
idiocy
he
was
conscious
indeed
that
he
must
presently
think
and
act
but
he
would
wait
refusing
to
understand
to
know
to
remember
out
of
fear
weakness
cowardice
he
was
one
of
those
procrastinators
who
put
everything
off
till
and
when
he
was
compelled
to
come
to
a
decision
then
and
there
still
he
instinctively
tried
to
gain
a
few
minutes
but
the
perfect
silence
which
now
reigned
after
pierre
vociferations
the
sudden
stillness
of
walls
and
furniture
with
the
bright
light
of
six
wax
candles
and
two
lamps
terrified
him
so
greatly
that
he
suddenly
longed
to
make
his
escape
too
then
he
roused
his
brain
roused
his
heart
and
tried
to
reflect
never
in
his
life
had
he
had
to
face
a
difficulty
there
are
men
who
let
themselves
glide
onward
like
running
water
he
had
been
duteous
over
his
tasks
for
fear
of
punishment
and
had
got
through
his
legal
studies
with
credit
because
his
existence
was
tranquil
everything
in
the
world
seemed
to
him
quite
natural
and
never
aroused
his
particular
attention
he
loved
order
steadiness
and
peace
by
temperament
his
nature
having
no
complications
and
face
to
face
with
this
catastrophe
he
found
himself
like
a
man
who
has
fallen
into
the
water
and
can
not
swim
at
first
he
tried
to
be
incredulous
his
brother
had
told
a
lie
out
of
hatred
and
jealousy
but
yet
how
could
he
have
been
so
vile
as
to
say
such
a
thing
of
their
mother
if
he
had
not
himself
been
distraught
by
despair
besides
stamped
on
jean
ear
on
his
sight
on
his
nerves
on
the
inmost
fibres
of
his
flesh
were
certain
words
certain
tones
of
anguish
certain
gestures
of
pierre
so
full
of
suffering
that
they
were
irresistibly
convincing
as
incontrovertible
as
certainty
itself
he
was
too
much
crushed
to
stir
or
even
to
will
his
distress
became
unbearable
and
he
knew
that
behind
the
door
was
his
mother
who
had
heard
everything
and
was
waiting
what
was
she
doing
not
a
movement
not
a
shudder
not
a
breath
not
a
sigh
revealed
the
presence
of
a
living
creature
behind
that
panel
could
she
have
run
away
but
how
if
she
had
run
away
she
must
have
jumped
out
of
the
window
into
the
street
a
shock
of
terror
roused
him
so
violent
and
imperious
that
he
drove
the
door
in
rather
than
opened
it
and
flung
himself
into
the
it
was
apparently
empty
lighted
by
a
single
candle
standing
on
the
chest
of
drawers
jean
flew
to
the
window
it
was
shut
and
the
shutters
bolted
he
looked
about
him
peering
into
the
dark
corners
with
anxious
eyes
and
he
then
noticed
that
the
were
drawn
he
ran
forward
and
opened
them
his
mother
was
lying
on
the
bed
her
face
buried
in
the
pillow
which
she
had
pulled
up
over
her
ears
that
she
might
hear
no
more
at
first
he
thought
she
had
smothered
herself
then
taking
her
by
the
shoulders
he
turned
her
over
without
her
leaving
go
of
the
pillow
which
covered
her
face
and
in
which
she
had
set
her
teeth
to
keep
herself
from
crying
out
but
the
mere
touch
of
this
rigid
form
of
those
arms
so
convulsively
clinched
communicated
to
him
the
shock
of
her
unspeakable
torture
the
strength
and
determination
with
which
she
clutched
the
linen
case
full
of
feathers
with
her
hands
and
teeth
over
her
mouth
and
eyes
and
ears
that
he
might
neither
see
her
nor
speak
to
her
gave
him
an
idea
by
the
turmoil
it
roused
in
him
of
the
pitch
suffering
may
rise
to
and
his
heart
his
simple
heart
was
torn
with
pity
he
was
no
judge
not
he
not
even
a
merciful
judge
he
was
a
man
full
of
weakness
and
a
son
full
of
love
he
remembered
nothing
of
what
his
brother
had
told
him
he
neither
reasoned
nor
argued
he
merely
laid
his
two
hands
on
his
mother
inert
body
and
not
being
able
to
pull
the
pillow
away
he
exclaimed
kissing
her
dress
mother
mother
my
poor
mother
look
at
me
she
would
have
seemed
to
be
dead
but
that
an
almost
imperceptible
shudder
ran
through
all
her
limbs
the
vibration
of
a
strained
cord
and
he
repeated
mother
mother
listen
to
me
it
is
not
true
i
know
that
it
is
not
a
spasm
seemed
to
come
over
her
a
fit
of
suffocation
then
she
suddenly
began
to
sob
into
the
pillow
her
sinews
relaxed
her
rigid
muscles
yielded
her
fingers
gave
way
and
left
go
of
the
linen
and
he
uncovered
her
face
she
was
pale
quite
colourless
and
from
under
her
closed
lids
tears
were
stealing
he
threw
his
arms
round
her
neck
and
kissed
her
eyes
slowly
with
long
kisses
wet
with
her
tears
and
he
said
again
and
again
mother
my
dear
mother
i
know
it
is
not
true
do
not
cry
i
know
it
it
is
not
she
raised
herself
she
sat
up
looked
in
his
face
and
with
an
effort
of
courage
such
as
it
must
cost
in
some
cases
to
kill
one
self
she
said
no
my
child
it
is
and
they
remained
speechless
each
in
the
presence
of
the
other
for
some
minutes
she
seemed
again
to
be
suffocating
craning
her
throat
and
throwing
back
her
head
to
get
breath
then
she
once
more
mastered
herself
and
went
on
it
is
true
my
child
why
lie
about
it
it
is
true
you
would
not
believe
me
if
i
denied
she
looked
like
a
crazy
creature
overcome
by
alarm
he
fell
on
his
knees
by
the
bedside
murmuring
hush
mother
be
she
stood
up
with
terrible
determination
and
energy
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
my
child
and
she
went
towards
the
door
he
threw
his
arms
about
her
exclaiming
what
are
you
doing
mother
where
are
you
going
i
do
not
know
how
should
i
know
there
is
nothing
left
for
me
to
do
now
that
i
am
she
struggled
to
be
released
holding
her
firmly
he
could
find
only
words
to
say
again
and
again
mother
mother
mother
and
through
all
her
efforts
to
free
herself
she
was
saying
no
no
i
am
not
your
mother
now
poor
boy
it
struck
him
clearly
that
if
he
let
her
go
now
he
should
never
see
her
again
lifting
her
up
in
his
arms
he
carried
her
to
an
forced
her
into
it
and
kneeling
down
in
front
of
her
barred
her
in
with
his
arms
you
shall
not
quit
this
spot
mother
i
love
you
and
i
will
keep
you
i
will
keep
you
always
i
love
you
and
you
are
she
murmured
in
a
dejected
tone
no
my
poor
boy
it
is
impossible
you
weep
but
you
would
turn
me
out
of
the
house
you
even
you
could
not
forgive
he
replied
i
i
how
little
you
know
me
with
such
a
burst
of
genuine
affection
that
with
a
cry
she
seized
his
head
by
the
hair
with
both
hands
and
dragging
him
violently
to
her
kissed
him
distractedly
all
over
his
face
then
she
sat
still
her
cheek
against
his
feeling
the
warmth
of
his
skin
through
his
beard
and
she
whispered
in
his
ear
no
my
little
jean
you
would
not
forgive
me
you
think
so
but
you
deceive
yourself
you
have
forgiven
me
this
evening
and
that
forgiveness
has
saved
my
life
but
you
must
never
see
me
and
he
repeated
clasping
her
in
his
arms
mother
do
not
say
yes
my
child
i
must
go
away
i
do
not
know
where
nor
how
i
shall
set
about
it
nor
what
i
shall
do
but
it
must
be
done
i
could
never
look
at
you
nor
kiss
you
do
you
understand
then
he
in
his
turn
spoke
into
her
ear
my
little
mother
you
are
to
stay
because
i
insist
because
i
want
you
and
you
must
pledge
your
word
to
obey
me
now
at
no
my
yes
mother
you
must
do
you
hear
you
no
my
child
it
is
impossible
it
would
be
condemning
us
all
to
the
tortures
of
hell
i
know
what
that
torment
is
i
have
known
it
this
month
past
your
feelings
are
touched
now
but
when
that
is
over
when
you
look
on
me
as
pierre
does
when
you
remember
what
i
have
told
you
oh
my
jean
think
think
i
am
your
mother
i
will
not
let
you
leave
me
mother
i
have
no
one
but
but
think
my
son
we
can
never
see
each
other
again
without
both
of
us
blushing
without
my
feeling
that
i
must
die
of
shame
without
my
eyes
falling
before
but
it
is
not
so
yes
yes
yes
it
is
so
oh
i
have
understood
all
your
poor
struggles
believe
me
all
from
the
very
first
day
now
when
i
hear
his
step
in
the
house
my
heart
beats
as
if
it
would
burst
when
i
hear
his
voice
i
am
ready
to
faint
i
still
had
you
now
i
have
you
no
longer
oh
my
little
jean
do
you
think
i
could
live
between
you
two
yes
i
should
love
you
so
much
that
you
would
cease
to
think
of
as
if
that
were
possible
but
it
is
how
do
you
suppose
that
i
could
cease
to
think
of
it
with
your
brother
and
you
on
each
hand
would
you
cease
to
think
of
it
i
ask
you
i
i
swear
i
why
you
would
think
of
it
at
every
hour
of
the
no
i
swear
it
besides
listen
if
you
go
away
i
will
enlist
and
get
this
boyish
threat
quite
overcame
her
she
clasped
jean
in
a
passionate
and
tender
embrace
he
went
on
i
love
you
more
than
you
think
ah
much
more
much
more
come
be
reasonable
try
to
stay
for
only
one
week
will
you
promise
me
one
week
you
can
not
refuse
me
that
she
laid
her
two
hands
on
jean
shoulders
and
holding
him
at
length
she
said
my
child
let
us
try
and
be
calm
and
not
give
way
to
emotions
first
listen
to
me
if
i
were
ever
to
hear
from
your
lips
what
i
have
heard
for
this
month
past
from
your
brother
if
i
were
once
to
see
in
your
eyes
what
i
read
in
his
if
i
could
fancy
from
a
word
or
a
look
that
i
was
as
odious
to
you
as
i
am
to
him
within
one
hour
mark
me
within
one
hour

should
be
gone
mother

for
a
month

i
have
suffered
all
that
any
creature
can
suffer
from
the
moment
when
i
perceived
that
your
brother
my
other
son
suspected
me
that
as
the
minutes
went
by
he
guessed
the
truth
every
moment
of
my
life
has
been
a
martyrdom
which
no
words
could
tell
her
voice
was
so
full
of
woe
that
the
contagion
of
her
misery
brought
the
tears
to
jean
eyes
he
tried
to
kiss
her
but
she
held
him
off
leave
me
listen
i
still
have
so
much
to
say
to
make
you
understand
but
you
never
can
understand
you
see
if
i
stayed
i
must
no
no
i
can
not
speak
on
mother
yes
indeed
for
at
least
i
shall
not
have
deceived
you
you
want
me
to
stay
with
you
for
what
for
us
to
be
able
to
see
each
other
speak
to
each
other
meet
at
any
hour
of
the
day
at
home
for
i
no
longer
dare
open
a
door
for
fear
of
finding
your
brother
behind
it
if
we
are
to
do
that
you
must
not
forgive
me
nothing
is
so
wounding
as
forgiveness
but
you
must
owe
me
no
grudge
for
what
i
have
done
you
must
feel
yourself
strong
enough
and
so
far
unlike
the
rest
of
the
world
as
to
be
able
to
say
to
yourself
that
you
are
not
roland
son
without
blushing
for
the
fact
or
despising
me
i
have
suffered
enough
i
have
suffered
too
much
i
can
bear
no
more
no
indeed
no
more
and
it
is
not
a
thing
of
yesterday
mind
you
but
of
long
long
years
but
you
could
never
understand
that
how
should
you
if
you
and
i
are
to
live
together
and
kiss
each
other
my
little
jean
you
must
believe
that
though
i
was
your
father
mistress
i
was
yet
more
truly
his
wife
his
real
wife
that
at
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
can
not
be
ashamed
of
it
that
i
have
no
regrets
that
i
love
him
still
even
in
death
that
i
shall
always
love
him
and
never
loved
any
other
man
that
he
was
my
life
my
joy
my
hope
my
comfort
everything
everything
in
the
world
to
me
for
so
long
listen
my
boy
before
god
who
hears
me
i
should
never
have
had
a
joy
in
my
existence
if
i
had
not
met
him
never
anything
not
a
touch
of
tenderness
or
kindness
not
one
of
those
hours
which
make
us
regret
growing
old
nothing
i
owe
everything
to
him
i
had
but
him
in
the
world
and
you
two
boys
your
brother
and
you
but
for
you
all
would
have
been
empty
dark
and
void
as
the
night
i
should
never
have
loved
or
known
or
cared
for
anything
i
should
not
even
have
wept
for
i
have
wept
my
little
jean
oh
yes
and
bitter
tears
since
we
came
to
havre
i
was
his
wholly
and
forever
for
ten
years
i
was
as
much
his
wife
as
he
was
my
husband
before
god
who
created
us
for
each
other
and
then
i
began
to
see
that
he
loved
me
less
he
was
always
kind
and
courteous
but
i
was
not
what
i
had
been
to
him
it
was
all
over
oh
how
i
have
cried
how
dreadful
and
delusive
life
is
nothing
lasts
then
we
came
here
i
never
saw
him
again
he
never
came
he
promised
it
in
every
letter
i
was
always
expecting
him
and
i
never
saw
him
again
and
now
he
is
dead
but
he
still
cared
for
us
since
he
remembered
you
i
shall
love
him
to
my
latest
breath
and
i
never
will
deny
him
and
i
love
you
because
you
are
his
child
and
i
could
never
be
ashamed
of
him
before
you
do
you
understand
i
could
not
so
if
you
wish
me
to
remain
you
must
accept
the
situation
as
his
son
and
we
will
talk
of
him
sometimes
and
you
must
love
him
a
little
and
we
must
think
of
him
when
we
look
at
each
other
if
you
will
not
do
this
if
you
can
not
then
my
child
it
is
impossible
that
we
should
live
together
now
i
will
act
by
your
jean
replied
gently
stay
she
clasped
him
in
her
arms
and
her
tears
flowed
again
then
with
her
face
against
his
she
went
on
well
but
pierre
what
can
we
do
about
pierre
jean
answered
we
will
find
some
plan
you
can
not
live
with
him
any
at
the
thought
of
her
elder
son
she
was
convulsed
with
terror
no
i
can
not
no
no
and
throwing
herself
on
jean
breast
she
cried
in
distress
of
mind
save
me
from
him
you
my
little
one
save
me
do
something
i
know
what
think
of
something
save
yes
mother
i
will
think
of
and
at
once
you
must
this
minute
do
not
leave
me
i
am
so
afraid
of
him
so
yes
yes
i
will
hit
on
some
plan
i
promise
you
i
but
at
once
quick
quick
you
can
not
imagine
what
i
feel
when
i
see
then
she
murmured
softly
in
his
ear
keep
me
here
with
he
paused
reflected
and
with
his
blunt
saw
at
once
the
dangers
of
such
an
arrangement
but
he
had
to
argue
for
a
long
time
combating
her
scared
insistence
only
for
she
said
only
for
and
morning
you
can
send
word
to
roland
that
i
was
taken
that
is
out
of
the
question
as
pierre
left
you
here
come
take
courage
i
will
arrange
everything
i
promise
you
i
will
be
with
you
by
nine
come
put
on
your
bonnet
i
will
take
you
i
will
do
just
what
you
desire
she
said
with
a
childlike
impulse
of
timidity
and
gratitude
she
tried
to
rise
but
the
shock
had
been
too
much
for
her
she
could
not
stand
he
made
her
drink
some
sugared
water
and
smell
at
some
salts
while
he
bathed
her
temples
with
vinegar
she
let
him
do
what
he
would
exhausted
but
comforted
as
after
the
pains
of
at
last
she
could
walk
and
she
took
his
arm
the
town
hall
struck
three
as
they
went
past
outside
their
own
door
jean
kissed
her
saying
mother
keep
up
your
she
stealthily
crept
up
the
silent
stairs
and
into
her
room
undressed
quickly
and
slipped
into
bed
with
a
reawakened
sense
of
that
sin
roland
was
snoring
in
all
the
house
pierre
alone
was
awake
and
had
heard
her
come
in
chapter
viii
when
he
got
back
to
his
lodgings
jean
dropped
on
a
sofa
for
the
sorrows
and
anxieties
which
made
his
brother
long
to
be
moving
and
to
flee
like
a
hunted
prey
acted
differently
on
his
torpid
nature
and
broke
the
strength
of
his
arms
and
legs
he
felt
too
limp
to
stir
a
finger
even
to
get
to
bed
limp
body
and
soul
crushed
and
he
had
not
been
hit
as
pierre
had
been
in
the
purity
of
filial
love
in
the
secret
dignity
which
is
the
refuge
of
a
proud
heart
he
was
overwhelmed
by
a
stroke
of
fate
which
at
the
same
time
threatened
his
own
nearest
interests
when
at
last
his
spirit
was
calmer
when
his
thoughts
had
settled
like
water
that
has
been
stirred
and
lashed
he
could
contemplate
the
situation
which
had
come
before
him
if
he
had
learned
the
secret
of
his
birth
through
any
other
channel
he
would
assuredly
have
been
very
wroth
and
very
deeply
pained
but
after
his
quarrel
with
his
brother
after
the
violent
and
brutal
betrayal
which
had
shaken
his
nerves
the
agonizing
emotion
of
his
mother
confession
had
so
bereft
him
of
energy
that
he
could
not
rebel
the
shock
to
his
feeling
had
been
so
great
as
to
sweep
away
in
an
irresistible
tide
of
pathos
all
prejudice
and
all
the
sacred
delicacy
of
natural
morality
besides
he
was
not
a
man
made
for
resistance
he
did
not
like
contending
against
any
one
least
of
all
against
himself
so
he
resigned
himself
at
once
and
by
instinctive
tendency
a
congenital
love
of
peace
and
of
an
easy
and
tranquil
life
he
began
to
anticipate
the
agitations
which
must
surge
up
around
him
and
at
once
be
his
ruin
he
foresaw
that
they
were
inevitable
and
to
avert
them
he
made
up
his
mind
to
superhuman
efforts
of
energy
and
activity
the
knot
must
be
cut
immediately
this
very
day
for
even
he
had
fits
of
that
imperious
demand
for
a
swift
solution
which
is
the
only
strength
of
weak
natures
incapable
of
a
prolonged
effort
of
will
his
mind
accustomed
as
it
was
to
disentangling
and
studying
complicated
situations
and
questions
of
domestic
difficulties
in
families
that
had
got
out
of
gear
at
once
foresaw
the
more
immediate
consequences
of
his
brother
state
of
mind
in
spite
of
himself
he
looked
at
the
issue
from
an
almost
professional
point
of
view
as
though
he
had
to
legislate
for
the
future
relations
of
certain
clients
after
a
moral
disaster
constant
friction
against
pierre
had
certainly
become
unendurable
he
could
easily
evade
it
no
doubt
by
living
in
his
own
lodgings
but
even
then
it
was
not
possible
that
their
mother
should
live
under
the
same
roof
with
her
elder
son
for
a
long
time
he
sat
meditating
motionless
on
the
cushions
devising
and
rejecting
various
possibilities
and
finding
nothing
that
satisfied
him
but
suddenly
an
idea
took
him
by
storm
this
fortune
which
had
come
to
him
would
an
honest
man
keep
it
no
was
the
first
immediate
answer
and
he
made
up
his
mind
that
it
must
go
to
the
poor
it
was
hard
but
it
could
not
be
helped
he
would
sell
his
furniture
and
work
like
any
other
man
like
any
other
beginner
this
manful
and
painful
resolution
spurred
his
courage
he
rose
and
went
to
the
window
leaning
his
forehead
against
the
pane
he
had
been
poor
he
could
become
poor
again
after
all
he
should
not
die
of
it
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
gas
lamp
burning
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
a
woman
much
belated
happened
to
pass
suddenly
he
thought
of
mme
rosemilly
with
a
pang
at
his
heart
the
shock
of
deep
feeling
which
comes
of
a
cruel
suggestion
all
the
dire
results
of
his
decision
rose
up
before
him
together
he
would
have
to
renounce
his
marriage
renounce
happiness
renounce
everything
could
he
do
such
a
thing
after
having
pledged
himself
to
her
she
had
accepted
him
knowing
him
to
be
rich
she
would
take
him
still
if
he
were
poor
but
had
he
any
right
to
demand
such
a
sacrifice
would
it
not
be
better
to
keep
this
money
in
trust
to
be
restored
to
the
poor
at
some
future
date
and
in
his
soul
where
selfishness
put
on
a
guise
of
honesty
all
these
specious
interests
were
struggling
and
contending
his
first
scruples
yielded
to
ingenious
reasoning
then
came
to
the
top
again
and
again
disappeared
he
sat
down
again
seeking
some
decisive
motive
some
pretext
to
solve
his
hesitancy
and
convince
his
natural
rectitude
twenty
times
over
had
he
asked
himself
this
question
since
i
am
this
man
son
since
i
know
and
acknowledge
it
is
it
not
natural
that
i
should
also
accept
the
inheritance
but
even
this
argument
could
not
suppress
the
no
murmured
by
his
inmost
conscience
then
came
the
thought
since
i
am
not
the
son
of
the
man
i
always
believed
to
be
my
father
i
can
take
nothing
from
him
neither
during
his
lifetime
nor
after
his
death
it
would
be
neither
dignified
nor
equitable
it
would
be
robbing
my
this
new
view
of
the
matter
having
relieved
him
and
quieted
his
conscience
he
went
to
the
window
again
yes
he
said
to
himself
i
must
give
up
my
share
of
the
family
inheritance
i
must
let
pierre
have
the
whole
of
it
since
i
am
not
his
father
son
that
is
but
just
then
is
it
not
just
that
i
should
keep
my
father
money
having
discerned
that
he
could
take
nothing
of
roland
savings
having
decided
on
giving
up
the
whole
of
this
money
he
agreed
he
resigned
himself
to
keeping
marechal
for
if
he
rejected
both
he
would
find
himself
reduced
to
beggary
this
delicate
question
being
thus
disposed
of
he
came
back
to
that
of
pierre
presence
in
the
family
how
was
he
to
be
got
rid
of
he
was
giving
up
his
search
for
any
practical
solution
when
the
whistle
of
a
coming
into
port
seemed
to
blow
him
an
answer
by
suggesting
a
scheme
then
he
threw
himself
on
his
bed
without
undressing
and
dozed
and
dreamed
till
daybreak
at
a
little
before
nine
he
went
out
to
ascertain
whether
his
plans
were
feasible
then
after
making
sundry
inquiries
and
calls
he
went
to
his
old
home
his
mother
was
waiting
for
him
in
her
room
if
you
had
not
come
she
said
i
should
never
have
dared
to
go
in
a
minute
roland
voice
was
heard
on
the
stairs
are
we
to
have
nothing
to
eat
hang
it
all
there
was
no
answer
and
he
roared
out
with
a
thundering
oath
this
time
josephine
what
the
devil
are
you
about
the
girl
voice
came
up
from
the
depths
of
the
basement
yes
what
is
it
where
is
your
madame
is
upstairs
with
then
he
shouted
looking
up
at
the
higher
floor
louise
mme
roland
half
opened
her
door
and
answered
what
is
it
my
dear
are
we
to
have
nothing
to
eat
hang
it
all
yes
my
dear
i
am
and
she
went
down
followed
by
jean
roland
as
soon
as
he
saw
him
exclaimed
hallo
there
you
are
sick
of
your
home
already
no
father
but
i
had
something
to
talk
over
with
mother
this
jean
went
forward
holding
out
his
hand
and
when
he
felt
his
fingers
in
the
old
man
fatherly
clasp
a
strange
unforeseen
emotion
thrilled
through
him
and
a
sense
as
of
parting
and
farewell
without
return
mme
roland
asked
pierre
is
not
come
down
her
husband
shrugged
his
shoulders
no
but
never
mind
him
he
is
always
we
will
begin
without
she
turned
to
jean
you
had
better
go
to
call
him
my
child
it
hurts
his
feelings
if
we
do
not
wait
for
yes
mother
i
will
and
the
young
man
went
he
mounted
the
stairs
with
the
fevered
determination
of
a
man
who
is
about
to
fight
a
duel
and
who
is
in
a
fright
when
he
knocked
at
the
door
pierre
said
come
he
went
in
the
elder
was
writing
leaning
over
his
table
said
jean
pierre
rose
and
they
shook
hands
as
if
nothing
had
occurred
are
you
not
coming
down
to
breakfast
well
you
see
i
have
a
good
deal
to
the
elder
brother
voice
was
tremulous
and
his
anxious
eye
asked
his
younger
brother
what
he
meant
to
do
they
are
waiting
for
oh
there
is
is
my
mother
down
yes
it
was
she
who
sent
me
to
fetch
ah
very
well
then
i
will
at
the
door
of
the
he
paused
doubtful
about
going
in
first
then
he
abruptly
opened
the
door
and
saw
his
father
and
mother
seated
at
the
table
opposite
each
other
he
went
straight
up
to
her
without
looking
at
her
or
saying
a
word
and
bending
over
her
offered
his
forehead
for
her
to
kiss
as
he
had
done
for
some
time
past
instead
of
kissing
her
on
both
cheeks
as
of
old
he
supposed
that
she
put
her
lips
near
but
he
did
not
feel
them
on
his
brow
and
he
straightened
himself
with
a
throbbing
heart
after
this
feint
of
a
caress
and
he
wondered
what
did
they
say
to
each
other
after
i
had
left
jean
constantly
addressed
her
tenderly
as
mother
or
dear
mother
took
care
of
her
waited
on
her
and
poured
out
her
wine
then
pierre
understood
that
they
had
wept
together
but
he
could
not
read
their
minds
did
jean
believe
in
his
mother
guilt
or
think
his
brother
a
base
wretch
and
all
his
for
having
uttered
the
horrible
thing
came
upon
him
again
choking
his
throat
and
his
tongue
and
preventing
his
either
eating
or
speaking
he
was
now
a
prey
to
an
intolerable
desire
to
fly
to
leave
the
house
which
was
his
home
no
longer
and
these
persons
who
were
bound
to
him
by
such
imperceptible
ties
he
would
gladly
have
been
off
that
moment
no
matter
whither
feeling
that
everything
was
over
that
he
could
not
endure
to
stay
with
them
that
his
presence
was
torture
to
them
and
that
they
would
bring
on
him
incessant
suffering
too
great
to
endure
jean
was
talking
chatting
with
roland
pierre
as
he
did
not
listen
did
not
hear
but
he
presently
was
aware
of
a
pointed
tone
in
his
brother
voice
and
paid
more
attention
to
his
words
jean
was
saying
she
will
be
the
finest
ship
in
their
fleet
they
say
she
is
of
tons
she
is
to
make
her
first
trip
next
roland
was
amazed
so
soon
i
thought
she
was
not
to
be
ready
for
sea
this
yes
the
work
has
been
pushed
forward
very
vigorously
to
get
her
through
her
first
voyage
before
the
autumn
i
looked
in
at
the
office
this
morning
and
was
talking
to
one
of
the
indeed
which
of
them
m
marchand
who
is
a
great
friend
of
the
chairman
of
the
oh
do
you
know
him
yes
and
i
wanted
to
ask
him
a
then
you
will
get
me
leave
to
go
over
every
part
of
the
lorraine
as
soon
as
she
comes
into
port
to
be
sure
nothing
could
be
then
jean
seemed
to
hesitate
to
be
weighing
his
words
and
to
want
to
lead
up
to
a
difficult
subject
he
went
on
on
the
whole
life
is
very
endurable
on
board
those
great
transatlantic
liners
more
than
half
the
time
is
spent
on
shore
in
two
splendid
cities
new
york
and
havre
and
the
remainder
at
sea
with
delightful
company
in
fact
very
pleasant
acquaintances
are
sometimes
made
among
the
passengers
and
very
useful
in
yes
really
very
useful
only
think
the
captain
with
his
perquisites
on
coal
can
make
as
much
as
thousand
francs
a
year
or
roland
muttered
an
oath
followed
by
a
whistle
which
testified
to
his
deep
respect
for
the
sum
and
the
captain
jean
went
on
the
purser
makes
as
much
as
ten
thousand
and
the
doctor
has
a
fixed
salary
of
five
thousand
with
lodgings
keep
light
firing
service
and
everything
which
makes
it
up
to
ten
thousand
at
least
that
is
very
good
pierre
raising
his
eyes
met
his
brother
and
understood
then
after
some
hesitation
he
asked
is
it
very
hard
to
get
a
place
as
medical
man
on
board
a
transatlantic
liner
yes
and
no
it
all
depends
on
circumstances
and
there
was
a
long
pause
then
the
doctor
began
again
next
month
you
say
the
lorraine
is
to
sail
yes
on
the
and
they
said
nothing
more
pierre
was
considering
it
certainly
would
be
a
way
out
of
many
difficulties
if
he
could
embark
as
medical
officer
on
board
the
steamship
he
could
see
he
might
perhaps
give
it
up
meanwhile
he
would
be
gaining
a
living
and
asking
for
nothing
from
his
parents
only
two
days
since
he
had
been
forced
to
sell
his
watch
for
he
would
no
longer
hold
out
his
hand
to
beg
of
his
mother
so
he
had
no
other
resource
left
no
opening
to
enable
him
to
eat
the
bread
of
any
house
but
this
which
had
become
uninhabitable
or
sleep
in
any
other
bed
or
under
any
other
roof
he
presently
said
with
some
little
hesitation
if
i
could
i
would
very
gladly
sail
in
jean
asked
what
should
hinder
you
i
know
no
one
in
the
transatlantic
shipping
roland
was
astounded
and
what
has
become
of
all
your
fine
schemes
for
getting
on
pierre
replied
in
a
low
voice
there
are
times
when
we
must
bring
ourselves
to
sacrifice
everything
and
renounce
our
fondest
hopes
and
after
all
it
is
only
to
make
a
beginning
a
way
of
saving
a
few
thousand
francs
to
start
fair
with
his
father
was
promptly
convinced
that
is
very
true
in
a
couple
of
years
you
can
put
by
six
or
seven
thousand
francs
and
that
well
laid
out
will
go
a
long
way
what
do
you
think
of
the
matter
louise
she
replied
in
a
voice
so
low
as
to
be
scarcely
audible
i
think
pierre
is
roland
exclaimed
i
will
go
and
talk
it
over
with
poulin
i
know
him
very
well
he
is
assessor
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
and
takes
an
interest
in
the
affairs
of
the
company
there
is
lenient
too
the
who
is
intimate
with
one
of
the
jean
asked
his
brother
would
you
like
me
to
feel
my
way
with
marchand
at
once
yes
i
should
be
very
after
thinking
a
few
minutes
pierre
added
the
best
thing
i
can
do
perhaps
will
be
to
write
to
my
professors
at
the
college
of
medicine
who
had
a
great
regard
for
me
very
inferior
men
are
sometimes
shipped
on
board
those
vessels
letters
of
strong
recommendation
from
such
professors
as
remusot
flanche
and
borriquel
would
do
more
for
me
in
an
hour
than
all
the
doubtful
introductions
in
the
world
it
would
be
enough
if
your
friend
marchand
would
lay
them
before
the
jean
approved
heartily
your
idea
is
really
and
he
smiled
quite
reassured
almost
happy
sure
of
success
and
incapable
of
allowing
himself
to
be
unhappy
for
long
you
will
write
he
said
directly
now
at
once
i
will
go
and
do
so
i
do
not
care
for
any
coffee
this
morning
i
am
too
he
rose
and
left
the
room
then
jean
turned
to
his
mother
and
you
mother
what
are
you
going
to
do
nothing
i
do
not
will
you
come
with
me
to
call
on
mme
rosemilly
why
yes
you
know
i
must
positively
go
to
see
her
yes
yes
to
be
why
must
you
positively
asked
roland
whose
habit
it
was
never
to
understand
what
was
said
in
his
presence
because
i
promised
her
i
oh
very
well
that
alters
the
and
he
began
to
fill
his
pipe
while
the
mother
and
son
went
upstairs
to
make
ready
when
they
were
in
the
street
jean
said
will
you
take
my
arm
mother
he
was
never
accustomed
to
offer
it
for
they
were
in
the
habit
of
walking
side
by
side
she
accepted
and
leaned
on
him
for
some
time
they
did
not
speak
then
he
said
you
see
that
pierre
is
quite
ready
and
willing
to
go
she
murmured
poor
boy
but
why
boy
he
will
not
be
in
the
least
unhappy
on
board
the
no
i
know
but
i
was
thinking
of
so
many
and
she
thought
for
a
long
time
her
head
bent
accommodating
her
step
to
her
son
then
in
the
peculiar
voice
in
which
we
sometimes
give
utterance
to
the
conclusion
of
long
and
secret
meditations
she
exclaimed
how
horrible
life
is
if
by
any
chance
we
come
across
any
sweetness
in
it
we
sin
in
letting
ourselves
be
happy
and
pay
dearly
for
it
he
said
in
a
whisper
do
not
speak
of
that
any
more
is
that
possible
i
think
of
nothing
you
will
forget
again
she
was
silent
then
with
deep
regret
she
said
how
happy
i
might
have
been
married
to
another
man
she
was
visiting
it
on
roland
now
throwing
all
the
responsibility
of
her
sin
on
his
ugliness
his
stupidity
his
clumsiness
the
heaviness
of
his
intellect
and
the
vulgarity
of
his
person
it
was
to
this
that
it
was
owing
that
she
had
betrayed
him
had
driven
one
son
to
desperation
and
had
been
forced
to
utter
to
the
other
the
most
agonizing
confession
that
can
make
a
mother
heart
bleed
she
muttered
it
is
so
frightful
for
a
young
girl
to
have
to
marry
such
a
husband
as
jean
made
no
reply
he
was
thinking
of
the
man
he
had
hitherto
believed
to
be
his
father
and
possibly
the
vague
notion
he
had
long
since
conceived
of
that
father
inferiority
with
his
brother
constant
irony
the
scornful
indifference
of
others
and
the
very
contempt
for
roland
had
somewhat
prepared
his
mind
for
his
terrible
avowal
it
had
all
made
it
less
dreadful
to
him
to
find
that
he
was
another
man
son
and
if
after
the
great
shock
and
agitation
of
the
previous
evening
he
had
not
suffered
the
reaction
of
rage
indignation
and
rebellion
which
mme
roland
had
feared
it
was
because
he
had
long
been
unconsciously
chafing
under
the
sense
of
being
the
child
of
this
lout
they
had
now
reached
the
dwelling
of
mme
rosemilly
she
lived
on
the
road
to
on
the
second
floor
of
a
large
tenement
which
she
owned
the
windows
commanded
a
view
of
the
whole
roadstead
on
seeing
mme
roland
who
entered
first
instead
of
merely
holding
out
her
hands
as
usual
she
put
her
arms
round
her
and
kissed
her
for
she
divined
the
purpose
of
her
visit
the
furniture
of
this
all
in
stamped
velvet
was
always
shrouded
in
the
walls
hung
with
flowered
paper
were
graced
by
four
engravings
the
purchase
of
her
late
husband
the
captain
they
represented
sentimental
scenes
of
seafaring
life
in
the
first
a
fisherman
wife
was
seen
waving
a
handkerchief
on
shore
while
the
vessel
which
bore
away
her
husband
vanished
on
the
horizon
in
the
second
the
same
woman
on
her
knees
on
the
same
shore
under
a
sky
shot
with
lightning
wrung
her
arms
as
she
gazed
into
the
distance
at
her
husband
boat
which
was
going
to
the
bottom
amid
impossible
waves
the
others
represented
similar
scenes
in
a
higher
rank
of
society
a
young
lady
with
fair
hair
resting
her
elbows
on
the
ledge
of
a
large
steamship
quitting
the
shore
gazed
at
the
already
distant
coast
with
eyes
full
of
tears
and
regret
whom
is
she
leaving
behind
then
the
same
young
lady
sitting
by
an
open
widow
with
a
view
of
the
sea
had
fainted
in
an
a
letter
she
had
dropped
lay
at
her
feet
so
he
is
dead
what
despair
visitors
were
generally
much
moved
and
charmed
by
the
commonplace
pathos
of
these
obvious
and
sentimental
works
they
were
at
once
intelligible
without
question
or
explanation
and
the
poor
women
were
to
be
pitied
though
the
nature
of
the
grief
of
the
more
elegant
of
the
two
was
not
precisely
known
but
this
very
doubt
contributed
to
the
sentiment
she
had
no
doubt
lost
her
lover
on
entering
the
room
the
eye
was
immediately
attracted
to
these
four
pictures
and
riveted
as
if
fascinated
if
it
wandered
it
was
only
to
return
and
contemplate
the
four
expressions
on
the
faces
of
the
two
women
who
were
as
like
each
other
as
two
sisters
and
the
very
style
of
these
works
in
their
shining
frames
crisp
sharp
and
highly
finished
with
the
elegance
of
a
fashion
plate
suggested
a
sense
of
cleanliness
and
propriety
which
was
confirmed
by
the
rest
of
the
fittings
the
seats
were
always
in
precisely
the
same
order
some
against
the
wall
and
some
round
the
circular
the
immaculately
white
curtains
hung
in
such
straight
and
regular
pleats
that
one
longed
to
crumple
them
a
little
and
never
did
a
grain
of
dust
rest
on
the
shade
under
which
the
gilt
clock
in
the
taste
of
the
first
empire
a
terrestrial
globe
supported
by
atlas
on
his
knees
looked
like
a
melon
left
there
to
ripen
the
two
women
as
they
sat
down
somewhat
altered
the
normal
position
of
their
chairs
you
have
not
been
out
this
morning
asked
mme
roland
no
i
must
own
to
being
rather
and
she
spoke
as
if
in
gratitude
to
jean
and
his
mother
of
all
the
pleasure
she
had
derived
from
the
expedition
and
the
i
ate
my
prawns
this
morning
she
added
and
they
were
excellent
if
you
felt
inclined
we
might
go
again
one
of
these
the
young
man
interrupted
her
before
we
start
on
a
second
fishing
excursion
suppose
we
complete
the
first
complete
it
it
seems
to
me
quite
nay
madame
i
for
my
part
caught
something
on
the
rocks
of
saint
jouain
which
i
am
anxious
to
carry
home
with
she
put
on
an
innocent
and
knowing
look
you
what
can
it
be
what
can
you
have
found
a
wife
and
my
mother
and
i
have
come
to
ask
you
whether
she
had
changed
her
mind
this
she
smiled
no
monsieur
i
never
change
my
and
then
he
held
out
his
hand
wide
open
and
she
put
hers
into
it
with
a
quick
determined
movement
then
he
said
as
soon
as
possible
i
as
soon
as
you
in
six
weeks
i
have
no
opinion
what
does
my
future
say
mme
roland
replied
with
a
rather
melancholy
smile
i
oh
i
can
say
nothing
i
can
only
thank
you
for
having
accepted
jean
for
you
will
make
him
very
we
will
do
our
best
somewhat
overcome
for
the
first
time
mme
rosemilly
rose
and
throwing
her
arms
round
mme
roland
kissed
her
a
long
time
as
a
child
of
her
own
might
have
done
and
under
this
new
embrace
the
poor
woman
sick
heart
swelled
with
deep
emotion
she
could
not
have
expressed
the
feeling
it
was
at
once
sad
and
sweet
she
had
lost
her
son
her
big
boy
but
in
return
she
had
found
a
daughter
a
daughter
when
they
faced
each
other
again
and
were
seated
they
took
hands
and
remained
so
looking
at
each
and
smiling
while
they
seemed
to
have
forgotten
jean
then
they
discussed
a
number
of
things
which
had
to
be
thought
of
in
view
of
an
early
marriage
and
when
everything
was
settled
and
decided
mme
rosemilly
seemed
suddenly
to
remember
a
further
detail
and
asked
you
have
consulted
roland
i
suppose
a
flush
of
colour
mounted
at
the
same
instant
on
the
face
of
both
mother
and
son
it
was
the
mother
who
replied
oh
no
it
is
quite
unnecessary
then
she
hesitated
feeling
that
some
explanation
was
needed
and
added
we
do
everything
without
saying
anything
to
him
it
is
enough
to
tell
him
what
we
have
decided
mme
rosemilly
not
in
the
least
surprised
only
smiled
taking
it
as
a
matter
of
course
for
the
good
man
counted
for
so
little
when
mme
roland
was
in
the
street
again
with
her
son
she
said
suppose
we
go
to
your
rooms
for
a
little
while
i
should
be
glad
to
she
felt
herself
homeless
shelterless
her
own
house
being
a
terror
to
her
they
went
into
jean
apartments
as
soon
as
the
door
was
closed
upon
her
she
heaved
a
deep
sigh
as
if
that
bolt
had
placed
her
in
safety
but
then
instead
of
resting
as
she
had
said
she
began
to
open
the
cupboards
to
count
the
piles
of
linen
the
and
socks
she
changed
the
arrangement
to
place
them
in
more
harmonious
order
more
pleasing
to
her
eye
and
when
she
had
put
everything
to
her
mind
laying
out
the
towels
the
shirts
and
the
drawers
on
their
several
shelves
and
dividing
all
the
linen
into
three
principal
classes
and
she
drew
back
and
contemplated
the
results
and
called
out
come
here
jean
and
see
how
nice
it
he
went
and
admired
it
to
please
her
on
a
sudden
when
he
had
sat
down
again
she
came
softly
up
behind
his
and
putting
her
right
arm
round
his
neck
she
kissed
him
while
she
laid
on
the
a
small
packet
wrapped
in
white
paper
which
she
held
in
the
other
hand
what
is
that
he
asked
then
as
she
made
no
reply
he
understood
recognising
the
shape
of
the
frame
give
it
me
he
said
she
pretended
not
to
hear
him
and
went
back
to
the
linen
cupboards
he
got
up
hastily
took
the
melancholy
relic
and
going
across
the
room
put
it
in
the
drawer
of
his
which
he
locked
and
double
locked
she
wiped
away
a
tear
with
the
tip
of
her
finger
and
said
in
a
rather
quavering
voice
now
i
am
going
to
see
whether
your
new
servant

chapter
ix
letters
of
recommendation
from
professors
remusot
flache
and
borriquel
written
in
the
most
flattering
terms
with
regard
to
pierre
roland
their
pupil
had
been
submitted
by
marchand
to
the
directors
of
the
transatlantic
shipping
seconded
by
poulin
judge
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
lenient
a
great
and
marival
deputy
to
the
mayor
of
havre
and
a
particular
friend
of
captain
beausires
it
proved
that
no
medical
officer
had
yet
been
appointed
to
the
lorraine
and
pierre
was
lucky
enough
to
be
nominated
within
a
few
days
the
letter
announcing
it
was
handed
to
him
one
morning
by
josephine
just
as
he
was
dressed
his
first
feeling
was
that
of
a
man
condemned
to
death
who
is
told
that
his
sentence
is
commuted
he
had
an
immediate
sense
of
relief
at
the
thought
of
his
early
departure
and
of
the
peaceful
life
on
board
cradled
by
the
rolling
waves
always
wandering
always
moving
his
life
under
his
father
roof
was
now
that
of
a
stranger
silent
and
reserved
ever
since
the
evening
when
he
allowed
the
shameful
secret
he
had
discovered
to
escape
him
in
his
presence
he
had
felt
that
the
last
ties
to
his
kindred
were
broken
he
was
harassed
by
remorse
for
having
told
this
thing
to
jean
he
felt
that
it
was
odious
indecent
and
brutal
and
yet
it
was
a
relief
to
him
to
have
uttered
it
he
never
met
the
eyes
either
of
his
mother
or
his
brother
to
avoid
his
gaze
theirs
had
become
surprisingly
alert
with
the
cunning
of
foes
who
fear
to
cross
each
other
he
was
always
wondering
what
can
she
have
said
to
jean
did
she
confess
or
deny
it
what
does
my
brother
believe
what
does
he
think
of
her
what
does
he
think
of
me
he
could
not
guess
and
it
drove
him
to
frenzy
and
he
scarcely
ever
spoke
to
them
excepting
when
roland
was
by
to
avoid
his
questioning
as
soon
as
he
received
the
letter
announcing
his
appointment
he
showed
it
at
once
to
his
family
his
father
who
was
prone
to
rejoicing
over
everything
clapped
his
hands
jean
spoke
seriously
though
his
heart
was
full
of
gladness
i
congratulate
you
with
all
my
heart
for
i
know
there
were
several
other
candidates
you
certainly
owe
it
to
your
professors
his
mother
bent
her
head
and
murmured
i
am
very
glad
you
have
been
after
breakfast
he
went
to
the
company
offices
to
obtain
information
on
various
particulars
and
he
asked
the
name
of
the
doctor
on
board
the
picardie
which
was
to
sail
next
day
to
inquire
of
him
as
to
the
details
of
his
new
life
and
any
details
he
might
think
useful
pirette
having
gone
on
board
pierre
went
to
the
ship
where
he
was
received
in
a
little
by
a
young
man
with
a
fair
beard
not
unlike
his
brother
they
talked
together
a
long
time
in
the
hollow
depths
of
the
huge
ship
they
could
hear
a
confused
and
continuous
commotion
the
noise
of
bales
and
cases
pitched
down
into
the
hold
mingling
with
footsteps
voices
the
creaking
of
the
machinery
lowering
the
freight
the
boatswain
whistle
and
the
clatter
of
chains
dragged
or
wound
on
to
capstans
by
the
snorting
and
panting
engine
which
sent
a
slight
vibration
from
end
to
end
of
the
great
vessel
but
when
pierre
had
left
his
colleague
and
found
himself
in
the
street
once
more
a
new
form
of
melancholy
came
down
on
him
enveloping
him
like
the
fogs
which
roll
over
the
sea
coming
up
from
the
ends
of
the
world
and
holding
in
their
intangible
density
something
mysteriously
impure
as
it
were
the
pestilential
breath
of
a
unhealthy
land
in
his
hours
of
greatest
suffering
he
had
never
felt
himself
so
sunk
in
a
foul
pit
of
misery
it
was
as
though
he
had
given
the
last
wrench
there
was
no
fibre
of
attachment
left
in
tearing
up
the
roots
of
every
affection
he
had
not
hitherto
had
the
distressful
feeling
which
now
came
over
him
like
that
of
a
lost
dog
it
was
no
longer
a
torturing
mortal
pain
but
the
frenzy
of
a
forlorn
and
homeless
animal
the
physical
anguish
of
a
vagabond
creature
without
a
roof
for
shelter
lashed
by
the
rain
the
wind
the
storm
all
the
brutal
forces
of
the
universe
as
he
set
foot
on
the
vessel
as
he
went
into
the
cabin
rocked
by
the
waves
the
very
flesh
of
the
man
who
had
always
slept
in
a
motionless
and
steady
bed
had
risen
up
against
the
insecurity
henceforth
of
all
his
morrows
till
now
that
flesh
had
been
protected
by
a
solid
wall
built
into
the
earth
which
held
it
by
the
certainty
of
resting
in
the
same
spot
under
a
roof
which
could
resist
the
gale
now
all
that
which
it
was
a
pleasure
to
defy
in
the
warmth
of
home
must
become
a
peril
and
a
constant
discomfort
no
earth
under
foot
only
the
greedy
heaving
complaining
sea
no
space
around
for
walking
running
losing
the
way
only
a
few
yards
of
planks
to
pace
like
a
convict
among
other
prisoners
no
trees
no
gardens
no
streets
no
houses
nothing
but
water
and
clouds
and
the
ceaseless
motion
of
the
ship
beneath
his
feet
on
stormy
days
he
must
lean
against
the
wainscot
hold
on
to
the
doors
cling
to
the
edge
of
the
narrow
berth
to
save
himself
from
rolling
out
on
calm
days
he
would
hear
the
snorting
throb
of
the
screw
and
feel
the
swift
flight
of
the
ship
bearing
him
on
in
its
unpausing
regular
exasperating
race
and
he
was
condemned
to
this
vagabond
convict
life
solely
because
his
mother
had
yielded
to
a
man
caresses
he
walked
on
his
heart
sinking
with
the
despairing
sorrow
of
those
who
are
doomed
to
exile
he
no
longer
felt
a
haughty
disdain
and
scornful
hatred
of
the
strangers
he
met
but
a
woeful
impulse
to
speak
to
them
to
tell
them
all
that
he
had
to
quit
france
to
be
listened
to
and
comforted
there
was
in
the
very
depths
of
his
heart
the
need
of
a
beggar
who
would
fain
hold
out
his
hand
a
timid
but
urgent
need
to
feel
that
some
one
would
grieve
at
his
departing
he
thought
of
marowsko
the
old
pole
was
the
only
person
who
loved
him
well
enough
to
feel
true
and
keen
emotion
and
the
doctor
at
once
determined
to
go
and
see
him
when
he
entered
the
shop
the
druggist
who
was
pounding
powders
in
a
marble
mortar
started
and
left
his
work
you
are
never
to
be
seen
nowadays
said
he
pierre
explained
that
he
had
had
a
great
many
serious
matters
to
attend
to
but
without
giving
the
reason
and
he
took
a
seat
asking
well
and
how
is
business
doing
business
was
not
doing
at
all
competition
was
fearful
and
rich
folks
rare
in
that
workmen
quarter
nothing
would
sell
but
cheap
drugs
and
the
doctors
did
not
prescribe
the
costlier
and
more
complicated
remedies
on
which
a
profit
is
made
of
five
hundred
per
cent
the
old
fellow
ended
by
saying
if
this
goes
on
for
three
months
i
shall
shut
up
shop
if
i
did
not
count
on
you
dear
good
doctor
i
should
have
turned
by
this
pierre
felt
a
pang
and
made
up
his
mind
to
deal
the
blow
at
once
since
it
must
be
done
i
oh
i
can
not
be
of
any
use
to
you
i
am
leaving
havre
early
next
marowsko
took
off
his
spectacles
so
great
was
his
agitation
you
you
what
are
you
saying
i
say
that
i
am
going
away
my
poor
the
old
man
was
stricken
feeling
his
last
hope
slipping
from
under
him
and
he
suddenly
turned
against
this
man
whom
he
had
followed
whom
he
loved
whom
he
had
so
implicitly
trusted
and
who
forsook
him
thus
he
stammered
out
you
are
surely
not
going
to
play
me
false
you
pierre
was
so
deeply
touched
that
he
felt
inclined
to
embrace
the
old
fellow
i
am
not
playing
you
false
i
have
not
found
anything
to
do
here
and
i
am
going
as
medical
officer
on
board
a
transatlantic
passenger
o
monsieur
pierre
and
you
always
promised
you
would
help
me
to
make
a
living
what
can
i
do
i
must
make
my
own
living
i
have
not
a
farthing
in
the
marowsko
said
it
is
wrong
what
you
are
doing
is
very
wrong
there
is
nothing
for
me
but
to
die
of
hunger
at
my
age
this
is
the
end
of
all
things
it
is
wrong
you
are
forsaking
a
poor
old
man
who
came
here
to
be
with
you
it
is
pierre
tried
to
explain
to
protest
to
give
reasons
to
prove
that
he
could
not
have
done
otherwise
the
pole
enraged
by
his
desertion
would
not
listen
to
him
and
he
ended
by
saying
with
an
allusion
no
doubt
to
political
events
you
french
you
never
keep
your
word
at
this
pierre
rose
offended
on
his
part
and
taking
rather
a
high
tone
he
said
you
are
unjust
pere
marowsko
a
man
must
have
very
strong
motives
to
act
as
i
have
done
and
you
ought
to
understand
that
au
revoir
i
hope
i
may
find
you
more
and
he
went
away
well
well
he
thought
not
a
soul
will
feel
a
sincere
regret
for
his
mind
sought
through
all
the
people
he
knew
or
had
known
and
among
the
faces
which
crossed
his
memory
he
saw
that
of
the
girl
at
the
tavern
who
had
led
him
to
doubt
his
mother
he
hesitated
having
still
an
instinctive
grudge
against
her
then
suddenly
reflected
on
the
other
hand
after
all
she
was
and
he
looked
about
him
to
find
the
turning
the
as
it
happened
was
full
of
people
and
also
full
of
smoke
the
customers
tradesmen
and
labourers
for
it
was
a
holiday
were
shouting
calling
laughing
and
the
master
himself
was
waiting
on
them
running
from
table
to
table
carrying
away
empty
glasses
and
returning
them
crowned
with
froth
when
pierre
had
found
a
seat
not
far
from
the
desk
he
waited
hoping
that
the
girl
would
see
him
and
recognise
him
but
she
passed
him
again
and
again
as
she
went
to
and
fro
pattering
her
feet
under
her
skirts
with
a
smart
little
strut
at
last
he
rapped
a
coin
on
the
table
and
she
hurried
up
what
will
you
take
sir
she
did
not
look
at
him
her
mind
was
absorbed
in
calculations
of
the
liquor
she
had
served
well
said
he
this
is
a
pretty
way
of
greeting
a
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
his
face
ah
said
she
hurriedly
is
it
you
you
are
pretty
well
but
i
have
not
a
minute
a
bock
did
you
wish
for
yes
a
bock
when
she
brought
it
he
said
i
have
come
to
say
i
am
going
and
she
replied
indifferently
indeed
where
are
you
going
to
a
very
fine
country
they
and
that
was
all
really
he
was
very
to
address
her
on
such
a
busy
day
there
were
too
many
people
in
the
cafe
pierre
went
down
to
the
sea
as
he
reached
the
jetty
he
descried
the
pearl
his
father
and
beausire
were
coming
in
papagris
was
pulling
and
the
two
men
seated
in
the
stern
smoked
their
pipes
with
a
look
of
perfect
happiness
as
they
went
past
the
doctor
said
to
himself
blessed
are
the
and
he
sat
down
on
one
of
the
benches
on
the
breakwater
to
try
to
lull
himself
in
animal
drowsiness
when
he
went
home
in
the
evening
his
mother
said
without
daring
to
lift
her
eyes
to
his
face
you
will
want
a
heap
of
things
to
take
with
you
i
have
ordered
your
and
i
went
into
the
tailor
shop
about
cloth
clothes
but
is
there
nothing
else
you
need
things
which
i
perhaps
know
nothing
about
his
lips
parted
to
say
no
but
he
reflected
that
he
must
accept
the
means
of
getting
a
decent
outfit
and
he
replied
in
a
very
calm
voice
i
hardly
know
myself
yet
i
will
make
inquiries
at
the
he
inquired
and
they
gave
him
a
list
of
indispensable
necessaries
his
mother
as
she
took
it
from
his
hand
looked
up
at
him
for
the
first
time
for
very
long
and
in
the
depths
of
her
eyes
there
was
the
humble
expression
gentle
sad
and
beseeching
of
a
dog
that
has
been
beaten
and
begs
forgiveness
on
the
of
october
the
lorraine
from
came
into
the
harbour
of
havre
to
sail
on
the
bound
for
new
york
and
pierre
roland
was
to
take
possession
of
the
little
floating
cabin
in
which
henceforth
his
life
was
to
be
confined
next
day
as
he
was
going
out
he
met
his
mother
on
the
stairs
waiting
for
him
to
murmur
in
an
almost
inaudible
voice
you
would
not
like
me
to
help
you
to
put
things
to
rights
on
board
no
thank
you
everything
is
then
she
said
i
should
have
liked
to
see
your
there
is
nothing
to
see
it
is
very
small
and
very
and
he
went
downstairs
leaving
her
stricken
leaning
against
the
wall
with
a
wan
face
now
roland
who
had
gone
over
the
lorraine
that
very
day
could
talk
of
nothing
all
dinnertime
but
this
splendid
vessel
and
wondered
that
his
wife
should
not
care
to
see
it
as
their
son
was
to
sail
on
board
pierre
had
scarcely
any
intercourse
with
his
family
during
the
days
which
followed
he
was
nervous
irritable
hard
and
his
rough
speech
seemed
to
lash
every
one
indiscriminately
but
the
day
before
he
left
he
was
suddenly
quite
changed
and
much
softened
as
he
embraced
his
parents
before
going
to
sleep
on
board
for
the
first
time
he
said
you
will
come
to
say
to
me
on
board
will
you
not
roland
exclaimed
why
yes
of
course
of
course
louise
certainly
certainly
she
said
in
a
low
voice
pierre
went
on
we
sail
at
eleven
precisely
you
must
be
there
by
nine
at
the
hah
cried
his
father
a
good
idea
as
soon
as
we
have
bid
you
we
will
make
haste
on
board
the
pearl
and
look
out
for
you
beyond
the
jetty
so
as
to
see
you
once
more
what
do
you
say
louise
roland
went
on
and
in
that
way
you
will
not
lose
sight
of
us
among
the
crowd
which
throngs
the
breakwater
when
the
great
liners
sail
it
is
impossible
to
distinguish
your
own
friends
in
the
mob
does
that
meet
your
views
yes
to
be
sure
that
is
an
hour
later
he
was
lying
in
his
berth
a
little
crib
as
long
and
narrow
as
a
coffin
there
he
remained
with
his
eyes
wide
open
for
a
long
time
thinking
over
all
that
had
happened
during
the
last
two
months
of
his
life
especially
in
his
own
soul
by
dint
of
suffering
and
making
others
suffer
his
aggressive
and
revengeful
anguish
had
lost
its
edge
like
a
blunted
sword
he
scarcely
had
the
heart
left
in
him
to
owe
any
one
or
anything
a
grudge
he
let
his
rebellious
wrath
float
away
down
stream
as
his
life
must
he
was
so
weary
of
wrestling
weary
of
fighting
weary
of
hating
weary
of
everything
that
he
was
quite
worn
out
and
tried
to
stupefy
his
heart
with
forgetfulness
as
he
dropped
asleep
he
heard
vaguely
all
about
him
the
unwonted
noises
of
the
ship
slight
noises
and
scarcely
audible
on
this
calm
night
in
port
and
he
felt
no
more
of
the
dreadful
wound
which
had
tortured
him
hitherto
but
the
discomfort
and
strain
of
its
healing
he
had
been
sleeping
soundly
when
the
stir
of
the
crew
roused
him
it
was
day
the
tidal
train
had
come
down
to
the
pier
bringing
the
passengers
from
paris
then
he
wandered
about
the
vessel
among
all
these
busy
bustling
folks
inquiring
for
their
cabins
questioning
and
answering
each
other
at
random
in
the
scare
and
fuss
of
a
voyage
already
begun
after
greeting
the
captain
and
shaking
hands
with
his
comrade
the
purser
he
went
into
the
saloon
where
some
englishmen
were
already
asleep
in
the
corners
the
large
low
room
with
its
white
marble
panels
framed
in
gilt
beading
was
furnished
with
which
prolonged
in
endless
perspective
the
long
tables
flanked
by
covered
with
red
velvet
it
was
fit
indeed
to
be
the
vast
floating
cosmopolitan
where
the
rich
natives
of
two
continents
might
eat
in
common
its
magnificent
luxury
was
that
of
great
hotels
and
theatres
and
public
rooms
the
imposing
and
commonplace
luxury
which
appeals
to
the
eye
of
the
millionaire
the
doctor
was
on
the
point
of
turning
into
the
saloon
when
he
remembered
that
a
large
cargo
of
emigrants
had
come
on
board
the
night
before
and
he
went
down
to
the
lower
deck
he
was
met
by
a
sickening
smell
of
dirty
humanity
an
atmosphere
of
naked
flesh
far
more
revolting
than
the
odour
of
fur
or
the
skin
of
wild
beasts
there
in
a
sort
of
basement
low
and
dark
like
a
gallery
in
a
mine
pierre
could
discern
some
hundreds
of
men
women
and
children
stretched
on
shelves
fixed
one
above
another
or
lying
on
the
floor
in
heaps
he
could
not
see
their
faces
but
could
dimly
make
out
this
squalid
ragged
crowd
of
wretches
beaten
in
the
struggle
for
life
worn
out
and
crushed
setting
forth
each
with
a
starving
wife
and
weakly
children
for
an
unknown
land
where
they
hoped
perhaps
not
to
die
of
hunger
and
as
he
thought
of
their
past
labour
wasted
labour
and
barren
effort
of
the
mortal
struggle
taken
up
afresh
and
in
vain
each
day
of
the
energy
expended
by
this
tattered
crew
who
were
going
to
begin
again
not
knowing
where
this
life
of
hideous
misery
he
longed
to
cry
out
to
them
tumble
yourselves
overboard
rather
with
your
women
and
your
little
and
his
heart
ached
so
with
pity
that
he
went
away
unable
to
endure
the
sight
he
found
his
father
his
mother
jean
and
mme
rosemilly
waiting
for
him
in
his
cabin
so
early
he
exclaimed
yes
said
mme
roland
in
a
trembling
voice
we
wanted
to
have
a
little
time
to
see
he
looked
at
her
she
was
dressed
all
in
black
as
if
she
were
in
mourning
and
he
noticed
that
her
hair
which
only
a
month
ago
had
been
gray
was
now
almost
white
it
was
very
difficult
to
find
space
for
four
persons
to
sit
down
in
the
little
room
and
he
himself
got
on
to
his
bed
the
door
was
left
open
and
they
could
see
a
great
crowd
hurrying
by
as
if
it
were
a
street
on
a
holiday
for
all
the
friends
of
the
passengers
and
a
host
of
inquisitive
visitors
had
invaded
the
huge
vessel
they
pervaded
the
passages
the
saloons
every
corner
of
the
ship
and
heads
peered
in
at
the
doorway
while
a
voice
murmured
outside
that
is
the
doctor
then
pierre
shut
the
door
but
no
sooner
was
he
shut
in
with
his
own
party
than
he
longed
to
open
it
again
for
the
bustle
outside
covered
their
agitation
and
want
of
words
mme
rosemilly
at
last
felt
she
must
speak
very
little
air
comes
in
through
those
little
said
pierre
he
showed
her
how
thick
the
glass
was
to
enable
it
to
resist
the
most
violent
shocks
and
took
a
long
time
explaining
the
fastening
roland
presently
asked
and
you
have
your
doctor
shop
here
the
doctor
opened
a
cupboard
and
displayed
an
array
of
phials
ticketed
with
latin
names
on
white
paper
labels
he
took
one
out
and
enumerated
the
properties
of
its
contents
then
a
second
and
a
third
a
perfect
lecture
on
therapeutics
to
which
they
all
listened
with
great
attention
roland
shaking
his
head
said
again
and
again
how
very
interesting
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
come
in
said
pierre
and
captain
beausire
appeared
i
am
late
he
said
as
he
shook
hands
i
did
not
want
to
be
in
the
he
too
sat
down
on
the
bed
and
silence
fell
once
more
suddenly
the
captain
pricked
his
ears
he
could
hear
the
orders
being
given
and
he
said
it
is
time
for
us
to
be
off
if
we
mean
to
get
on
board
the
pearl
to
see
you
once
more
outside
and
bid
you
out
on
the
open
old
roland
was
very
eager
about
this
to
impress
the
voyagers
on
board
the
lorraine
no
doubt
and
he
rose
in
haste
my
he
kissed
pierre
on
the
whiskers
and
then
opened
the
door
mme
roland
had
not
stirred
but
sat
with
downcast
eyes
very
pale
her
husband
touched
her
arm
come
he
said
we
must
make
haste
we
have
not
a
minute
to
she
pulled
herself
up
went
to
her
son
and
offered
him
first
one
and
then
another
cheek
of
white
wax
which
he
kissed
without
saying
a
word
then
he
shook
hands
with
mme
rosemilly
and
his
brother
asking
and
when
is
the
wedding
to
be
i
do
not
know
yet
exactly
we
will
make
it
fit
in
with
one
of
your
return
at
last
they
were
all
out
of
the
cabin
and
up
on
deck
among
the
crowd
of
visitors
porters
and
sailors
the
steam
was
snorting
in
the
huge
belly
of
the
vessel
which
seemed
to
quiver
with
impatience
said
roland
in
a
great
bustle
replied
pierre
standing
on
one
of
the
lying
between
the
deck
of
the
lorraine
and
the
quay
he
shook
hands
all
round
once
more
and
they
were
gone
make
haste
jump
into
the
carriage
cried
the
father
a
fly
was
waiting
for
them
and
took
them
to
the
outer
harbour
where
papagris
had
the
pearl
in
readiness
to
put
out
to
sea
there
was
not
a
breath
of
air
it
was
one
of
those
crisp
still
autumn
days
when
the
sheeny
sea
looks
as
cold
and
hard
as
polished
steel
jean
took
one
oar
the
sailor
seized
the
other
and
they
pulled
off
on
the
breakwater
on
the
piers
even
on
the
granite
parapets
a
crowd
stood
packed
hustling
and
noisy
to
see
the
lorraine
come
out
the
pearl
glided
down
between
these
two
waves
of
humanity
and
was
soon
outside
the
mole
captain
beausire
seated
between
the
two
women
held
the
tiller
and
he
said
you
will
see
we
shall
be
close
in
her
way
and
the
two
oarsmen
pulled
with
all
their
might
to
get
out
as
far
as
possible
suddenly
roland
cried
out
here
she
comes
i
see
her
masts
and
her
two
funnels
she
is
coming
out
of
the
inner
cheerily
lads
cried
beausire
mme
roland
took
out
her
handkerchief
and
held
it
to
her
eyes
roland
stood
up
clinging
to
the
mast
and
answered
at
this
moment
she
is
working
round
in
the
outer
harbour
she
is
standing
still
now
she
moves
again
she
is
taking
the
on
board
no
doubt
there
she
goes
bravo
she
is
between
the
piers
do
you
hear
the
crowd
shouting
bravo
the
neptune
has
her
in
tow
now
i
see
her
bows
here
she
comes
here
she
is
gracious
heavens
what
a
ship
look
look
mme
rosemilly
and
beausire
looked
behind
them
the
oarsmen
ceased
pulling
only
mme
roland
did
not
stir
the
immense
steamship
towed
by
a
powerful
tug
which
in
front
of
her
looked
like
a
caterpillar
came
slowly
and
majestically
out
of
the
harbour
and
the
good
people
of
havre
who
crowded
the
piers
the
beach
and
the
windows
carried
away
by
a
burst
of
patriotic
enthusiasm
cried
la
lorraine
with
acclamations
and
applause
for
this
magnificent
beginning
this
birth
of
the
beautiful
daughter
given
to
the
sea
by
the
great
maritime
town
she
as
soon
as
she
had
passed
beyond
the
narrow
channel
between
the
two
granite
walls
feeling
herself
free
at
last
cast
off
the
and
went
off
alone
like
a
monstrous
creature
walking
on
the
waters
here
she
is
here
she
comes
straight
down
on
us
roland
kept
shouting
and
beausire
beaming
exclaimed
what
did
i
promise
you
heh
do
i
know
the
way
jean
in
a
low
tone
said
to
his
mother
look
mother
she
is
close
upon
us
and
mme
roland
uncovered
her
eyes
blinded
with
tears
the
lorraine
came
on
still
under
the
impetus
of
her
swift
exit
from
the
harbour
in
the
brilliant
calm
weather
beausire
with
his
glass
to
his
eye
called
out
look
out
pierre
is
at
the
stern
all
alone
plainly
to
be
seen
look
out
the
ship
was
almost
touching
the
pearl
now
as
tall
as
a
mountain
and
as
swift
as
a
train
mme
roland
distraught
and
desperate
held
out
her
arms
towards
it
and
she
saw
her
son
her
pierre
with
his
officer
cap
on
throwing
kisses
to
her
with
both
hands
but
he
was
going
away
flying
vanishing
a
tiny
speck
already
no
more
than
an
imperceptible
spot
on
the
enormous
vessel
she
tried
still
to
distinguish
him
but
she
could
not
jean
took
her
hand
you
saw
he
said
yes
i
saw
how
good
he
is
and
they
turned
to
go
home
cristi
how
fast
she
goes
exclaimed
roland
with
enthusiastic
conviction
the
steamer
in
fact
was
shrinking
every
second
as
though
she
were
melting
away
in
the
ocean
mme
roland
turning
back
to
look
at
her
watched
her
disappearing
on
the
horizon
on
her
way
to
an
unknown
land
at
the
other
side
of
the
world
in
that
vessel
which
nothing
could
stay
that
vessel
which
she
soon
would
see
no
more
was
her
son
her
poor
son
and
she
felt
as
though
half
her
heart
had
gone
with
him
she
felt
too
as
if
her
life
were
ended
yes
and
she
felt
as
though
she
would
never
see
the
child
again
why
are
you
crying
asked
her
husband
when
you
know
he
will
be
back
again
within
a
she
stammered
out
i
do
know
i
cry
because
i
am
when
they
had
landed
beausire
at
once
took
leave
of
them
to
go
to
breakfast
with
a
friend
then
jean
led
the
way
with
mme
rosemilly
and
roland
said
to
his
wife
a
very
fine
fellow
all
the
same
is
our
yes
replied
the
mother
and
her
mind
being
too
much
bewildered
to
think
of
what
she
was
saying
she
went
on
i
am
very
glad
that
he
is
to
marry
mme
the
worthy
man
was
astounded
heh
what
he
is
to
marry
mme
rosemilly
yes
we
meant
to
ask
your
opinion
about
it
this
very
bless
me
and
has
this
engagement
been
long
in
the
wind
oh
no
only
a
very
few
days
jean
wished
to
make
sure
that
she
would
accept
him
before
consulting
roland
rubbed
his
hands
very
good
very
good
it
is
capital
i
entirely
as
they
were
about
to
turn
off
from
the
quay
down
the
boulevard
francois
his
wife
once
more
looked
back
to
cast
a
last
look
at
the
high
seas
but
she
could
see
nothing
now
but
a
puff
of
gray
smoke
so
far
away
so
faint
that
it
looked
like
a
film
of
haze
