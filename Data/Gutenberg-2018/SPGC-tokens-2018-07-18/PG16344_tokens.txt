malarius
friend
there
is
probably
neither
in
europe
nor
anywhere
else
a
scholar
whose
face
is
more
universally
known
than
that
of
schwaryencrona
of
stockholm
his
portrait
appears
on
the
millions
of
bottles
with
green
seals
which
are
sent
to
the
confines
of
the
globe
truth
compels
us
to
state
that
these
bottles
only
contain
cod
liver
oil
a
good
and
useful
medicine
which
is
sold
to
the
inhabitants
of
norway
for
a
couronnes
which
is
worth
one
franc
and
centimes
formerly
this
oil
was
made
by
the
fishermen
but
now
the
process
is
a
more
scientific
one
and
the
prince
of
this
special
industry
is
the
celebrated
schwaryencrona
there
is
no
one
who
has
not
seen
his
pointed
beard
his
spectacles
his
hooked
nose
and
his
cap
of
otter
skin
the
engraving
perhaps
is
not
very
fine
but
it
is
certainly
a
striking
likeness
a
proof
of
this
is
what
happened
one
day
in
a
primary
school
in
noroe
on
the
western
coast
of
norway
a
few
leagues
from
bergen
two
had
struck
the
pupils
were
in
their
classes
in
the
large
sanded
hall
the
girls
on
the
left
and
the
boys
on
the
right
occupied
in
following
the
demonstration
which
their
teacher
malarius
was
making
on
the
suddenly
the
door
opened
and
a
fur
coat
fur
boots
fur
gloves
and
a
cap
of
otter
made
their
appearance
on
the
threshold
the
pupils
immediately
rose
respectfully
as
is
usual
when
a
stranger
visits
the
none
of
them
had
ever
seen
the
new
arrival
before
but
they
all
whispered
when
they
saw
him
doctor
schwaryencrona
so
much
did
the
picture
engraved
on
the
bottles
resemble
the
doctor
we
must
say
that
the
pupils
of
malarius
had
the
bottles
continually
before
their
eyes
for
one
of
the
principal
manufactories
of
the
doctor
was
at
noroe
but
for
many
years
the
learned
man
had
not
visited
that
place
and
none
of
the
children
consequently
could
have
beheld
him
in
the
flesh
in
imagination
it
was
another
matter
for
they
often
spoke
of
him
in
noroe
and
his
ears
must
have
often
tingled
if
the
popular
belief
has
any
foundation
be
this
as
it
may
his
recognition
was
unanimous
and
a
triumph
for
the
unknown
artist
who
had
drawn
his
portrait
a
triumph
of
which
this
modest
artist
might
justly
be
proud
and
of
which
more
than
one
photographer
in
the
world
might
well
be
jealous
but
what
astonished
and
disappointed
the
pupils
a
little
was
to
discover
that
the
doctor
was
a
man
below
the
ordinary
height
and
not
the
giant
which
they
had
imagined
him
to
be
how
could
such
an
illustrious
man
be
satisfied
with
a
height
of
only
five
feet
three
inches
his
gray
head
hardly
reached
the
shoulder
of
malarius
and
he
was
already
stooping
with
age
he
was
also
much
thinner
than
the
doctor
which
made
him
appear
twice
as
tall
his
large
brown
overcoat
to
which
long
use
had
given
a
greenish
tint
hung
loosely
around
him
he
wore
short
breeches
and
shoes
with
buckles
and
from
beneath
his
black
silk
cap
a
few
gray
locks
had
made
their
escape
his
rosy
cheeks
and
smiling
countenance
gave
an
expression
of
great
sweetness
to
his
face
he
also
wore
spectacles
through
which
he
did
not
cast
piercing
glances
like
the
doctor
but
through
them
his
blue
eyes
shone
with
inexhaustible
benevolence
in
the
memory
of
his
pupils
malarius
had
never
punished
a
scholar
but
nevertheless
they
all
respected
him
and
loved
him
he
had
a
brave
soul
and
all
the
world
knew
it
very
well
they
were
not
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
in
his
youth
he
had
passed
brilliant
examinations
and
that
he
had
been
offered
a
professorship
in
a
great
university
where
he
might
have
attained
to
honor
and
wealth
but
he
had
a
sister
poor
kristina
who
was
always
ill
and
suffering
she
would
not
have
left
her
native
village
for
the
world
for
she
felt
sure
that
she
would
die
if
they
removed
to
the
city
so
malarius
had
submitted
gently
to
her
wishes
and
sacrificed
his
own
prospects
he
had
accepted
the
humble
duty
of
the
village
and
when
twenty
years
afterward
kristina
had
died
blessing
him
he
had
become
accustomed
to
his
obscure
and
retired
life
and
did
not
care
to
change
it
he
was
absorbed
in
his
work
and
forgot
the
world
he
found
a
supreme
pleasure
in
becoming
a
model
instructor
and
in
having
the
school
in
his
country
above
all
he
liked
to
instruct
his
best
pupils
in
the
higher
branches
to
initiate
them
into
scientific
studies
and
in
ancient
and
modern
literature
and
give
them
the
information
which
is
usually
the
portion
of
the
higher
classes
and
not
bestowed
upon
the
children
of
fishermen
and
peasants
what
is
good
for
one
class
is
good
for
the
other
he
argued
if
the
poor
have
not
as
many
comforts
that
is
no
reason
why
they
should
be
denied
an
acquaintance
with
homer
and
shakespeare
the
names
of
the
stars
which
guide
them
across
the
ocean
or
of
the
plants
which
grow
on
the
earth
they
will
soon
see
them
laid
low
by
their
ploughs
but
in
their
infancy
at
least
they
will
have
drunk
from
pure
sources
and
participated
in
the
common
patrimony
of
mankind
in
more
than
one
country
this
system
would
have
been
thought
imprudent
and
calculated
to
disgust
the
lowly
with
their
humble
lot
in
life
and
lead
them
to
wander
away
in
search
of
adventures
but
in
norway
nobody
thinks
of
these
things
the
patriarchal
sweetness
of
their
dispositions
the
distance
between
the
villages
and
the
laborious
habits
of
the
people
seem
to
remove
all
danger
of
this
kind
this
higher
instruction
is
more
frequent
than
a
stranger
would
believe
to
be
possible
nowhere
is
education
more
generally
diffused
and
nowhere
is
it
carried
so
high
as
well
in
the
poorest
rural
schools
as
in
the
colleges
therefore
the
scandinavian
peninsula
may
flatter
herself
that
she
has
produced
more
learned
and
distinguished
men
in
proportion
to
her
population
than
any
other
region
of
europe
the
traveler
is
constantly
astonished
by
the
contrast
between
the
wild
and
savage
aspect
of
nature
and
the
manufactures
and
works
of
art
which
represent
the
most
refined
civilization
but
perhaps
it
is
time
for
us
to
return
to
noroe
and
schwaryencrona
whom
we
have
left
on
the
threshold
of
the
school
if
the
pupils
had
been
quick
to
recognize
him
although
they
had
never
seen
him
before
it
had
been
different
with
the
instructor
whose
acquaintance
with
him
dated
further
back
ah
my
dear
malarius
said
the
visitor
cordially
advancing
with
outstretched
hands
toward
the
sir
you
are
very
welcome
answered
the
latter
a
little
surprised
and
somewhat
timidly
as
is
customary
with
all
men
who
have
lived
secluded
lives
and
are
interrupted
in
the
midst
of
their
duties
but
excuse
me
if
i
ask
whom
i
have
the
honor
of
what
have
i
changed
so
much
since
we
ran
together
over
the
snow
and
smoked
our
long
pipes
at
christiania
have
you
forgotten
our
krauss
and
must
i
name
your
comrade
and
friend
schwaryencrona
cried
malarius
is
it
is
it
really
is
it
the
doctor
oh
i
beg
of
you
omit
all
ceremony
i
am
your
old
friend
roff
and
you
are
my
brave
olaf
the
best
the
dearest
friend
of
my
youth
yes
i
know
you
well
we
have
both
changed
a
little
in
thirty
years
but
our
hearts
are
still
young
and
we
have
always
kept
a
little
corner
in
them
for
those
whom
we
learned
to
love
when
we
were
students
and
eat
our
dry
bread
side
by
side
the
doctor
laughed
and
squeezed
the
hands
of
malarius
whose
eyes
were
moist
my
dear
friend
my
good
excellent
doctor
you
must
not
stay
here
said
he
i
will
give
all
these
youngsters
a
holiday
for
which
they
will
not
be
sorry
i
assure
you
and
then
you
must
go
home
with
me
not
at
all
declared
the
doctor
turning
toward
the
pupils
who
were
watching
this
scene
with
lively
interest
i
must
neither
interfere
with
your
work
nor
the
studies
of
these
youths
if
you
wish
to
give
me
great
pleasure
you
will
permit
me
to
sit
here
near
you
while
you
resume
your
teaching
i
would
willingly
do
so
answered
malarius
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
have
no
longer
any
heart
for
geometry
besides
having
mentioned
a
holiday
i
do
not
like
to
disappoint
the
children
there
is
one
way
of
arranging
the
matter
however
if
doctor
schwaryencrona
would
deign
to
do
my
pupils
the
honor
of
questioning
them
about
their
studies
and
then
i
will
dismiss
them
for
the
rest
of
the
day
an
excellent
idea
i
shall
be
only
too
happy
to
do
so
i
will
become
their
examiner
then
taking
the
master
seat
he
addressed
the
school
tell
me
asked
the
doctor
who
is
the
best
pupil
erik
hersebom
answered
fifty
youthful
voices
unhesitatingly
ah
erik
hersebom
well
erik
will
you
come
here
a
young
boy
about
twelve
years
of
age
who
was
seated
on
the
front
row
of
benches
approached
his
chair
he
was
a
grave
child
whose
pensive
cast
of
countenance
and
large
deep
set
eyes
would
have
attracted
attention
anywhere
and
he
was
the
more
remarkable
because
of
the
blonde
heads
by
which
he
was
surrounded
while
all
his
companions
of
both
sexes
had
hair
the
color
of
flax
rosy
complexions
and
blue
eyes
his
hair
was
of
deep
chestnut
color
like
his
eyes
and
his
skin
was
brown
he
had
not
the
prominent
cheek
bones
the
short
nose
and
the
stout
frame
of
these
scandinavian
children
in
a
word
by
his
physical
characteristics
so
plainly
marked
it
was
evident
that
he
did
not
belong
to
the
race
by
whom
he
was
surrounded
he
was
clothed
like
them
in
the
coarse
cloth
of
the
country
made
in
the
style
common
among
the
peasantry
of
bergen
but
the
delicacy
of
his
limbs
the
smallness
of
his
head
the
easy
elegance
of
his
poise
and
the
natural
gracefulness
of
his
movements
and
attitudes
all
seemed
to
denote
a
foreign
origin
no
physiologist
could
have
helped
being
struck
at
once
by
these
peculiarities
and
such
was
the
case
with
schwaryencrona
however
he
had
no
motive
for
calling
attention
to
these
facts
and
he
simply
proceeded
to
fulfill
the
duty
which
he
had
undertaken
where
shall
we
begin
with
grammar
he
asked
the
young
lad
i
am
at
the
command
of
the
doctor
answered
erik
modestly
the
doctor
then
gave
him
two
or
three
simple
questions
but
was
astonished
to
hear
him
answer
them
not
only
in
the
swedish
language
but
also
in
french
and
english
it
was
the
usual
custom
of
malarius
who
contended
that
it
was
as
easy
to
learn
three
languages
at
once
as
it
was
to
learn
only
one
you
teach
them
french
and
english
then
said
the
doctor
turning
toward
his
friend
why
not
also
the
elements
of
greek
and
latin
i
do
not
see
what
harm
it
can
do
them
nor
i
said
the
doctor
laughing
and
erik
hersebom
translated
several
sentences
very
correctly
in
one
of
the
sentences
reference
was
made
to
the
hemlock
drunk
by
socrates
and
malarius
asked
the
doctor
to
question
him
as
to
the
family
which
this
plant
belonged
to
erik
answered
without
hesitation
that
it
was
one
of
the
family
of
umbelliferous
plants
and
described
them
in
detail
from
botany
they
passed
to
geometry
and
erik
demonstrated
clearly
a
theorem
relative
to
the
sum
of
the
angles
of
a
triangle
the
doctor
became
every
moment
more
and
more
surprised
let
us
have
a
little
talk
about
geography
he
said
what
sea
is
it
which
bounds
scandinavia
russia
and
siberia
on
the
north
it
is
the
arctic
ocean
and
what
waters
does
this
ocean
communicate
with
the
atlantic
on
the
west
and
the
pacific
on
the
east
can
you
name
two
or
three
of
the
most
important
seaports
on
the
pacific
i
can
mention
yokohama
in
japan
melbourne
in
australia
san
francisco
in
the
state
of
california
well
since
the
arctic
ocean
communicates
on
one
side
with
the
atlantic
and
on
the
other
with
the
pacific
do
you
not
think
that
the
shortest
route
to
yokohama
or
san
francisco
would
be
through
this
arctic
ocean
assuredly
answered
erik
it
would
be
the
shortest
way
if
it
were
practicable
but
all
navigators
who
have
attempted
to
follow
it
have
been
prevented
by
ice
and
been
compelled
to
renounce
the
enterprise
when
they
have
escaped
death
have
they
often
attempted
to
discover
the
passage
at
least
fifty
times
during
the
last
three
centuries
but
without
success
could
you
mention
a
few
of
the
expeditions
the
first
was
organized
in
under
the
direction
of
franois
sebastian
cabot
it
consisted
of
three
vessels
under
the
command
of
the
unfortunate
sir
hugh
willoughby
who
perished
in
lapland
with
all
his
crew
one
of
his
lieutenants
chancellor
was
at
first
successful
and
opened
a
direct
route
through
the
polar
sea
but
he
also
while
making
a
second
attempt
was
shipwrecked
and
perished
a
captain
stephen
borough
who
was
sent
in
search
of
him
succeeded
in
making
his
way
through
the
strait
which
separates
nova
zembla
from
the
island
of
waigate
and
in
penetrating
into
the
sea
of
kara
but
the
fog
and
ice
prevented
him
from
going
any
further
two
expeditions
which
were
sent
out
in
were
equally
unsuccessful
the
project
was
nevertheless
revived
by
the
hollanders
about
fifteen
years
later
and
they
fitted
out
successively
three
expeditions
under
the
command
of
barentz
in
barentz
also
perished
in
the
ice
of
nova
zembla
ten
years
later
henry
hudson
was
sent
out
but
also
failed
the
danes
were
not
more
successful
in
in
captain
john
wood
was
also
shipwrecked
since
that
period
the
passage
has
been
considered
impracticable
and
abandoned
by
the
maritime
powers
has
it
never
been
attempted
since
that
epoch
it
has
been
by
russia
to
whom
it
would
be
of
immense
advantage
as
well
as
to
all
the
northern
nations
to
find
a
direct
route
between
her
shores
and
siberia
she
has
sent
out
during
a
century
no
less
than
eighteen
expeditions
to
explore
the
coasts
of
nova
zembla
the
sea
of
kara
and
the
eastern
and
western
coasts
of
siberia
but
although
these
expeditions
have
made
these
places
better
known
they
have
also
demonstrated
the
impossibility
of
forcing
a
passage
through
the
arctic
ocean
the
academician
van
baer
who
made
the
last
attempt
in
after
admiral
lutke
and
pachtusow
declared
emphatically
that
this
ocean
is
simply
a
glacier
as
impracticable
for
vessels
as
it
would
be
if
it
were
a
continent
must
we
then
renounce
all
hopes
of
discovering
a
passage
that
seems
to
be
the
conclusion
which
we
must
arrive
at
from
the
failure
of
these
numerous
attempts
it
is
said
however
that
a
great
navigator
named
nordenskiold
wishes
to
make
another
attempt
after
he
has
prepared
himself
by
first
exploring
portions
of
this
polar
sea
if
he
then
considers
it
practicable
he
may
get
up
another
expedition
schwaryencrona
was
a
warm
admirer
of
nordenskiold
and
this
is
why
he
had
asked
these
questions
about
the
passage
he
was
charmed
with
the
clearness
of
these
answers
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
erik
hersebom
with
an
expression
of
the
deepest
interest
where
did
you
learn
all
this
my
dear
child
he
demanded
after
a
short
silence
here
sir
answered
erik
surprised
at
the
question
you
have
never
studied
in
any
other
school
certainly
not
malarius
may
be
proud
of
you
then
said
the
doctor
turning
toward
the
master
i
am
very
well
satisfied
with
erik
said
the
latter
he
has
been
my
pupil
for
eight
years
when
i
first
took
him
he
was
very
young
and
he
has
always
been
at
the
head
of
his
section
the
doctor
became
silent
his
piercing
eyes
were
fixed
upon
erik
with
a
singular
intensity
he
seemed
to
be
considering
some
problem
which
it
would
not
be
wise
to
mention
he
could
not
have
answered
my
question
better
and
i
think
it
useless
to
continue
the
examination
he
said
at
last
i
will
no
longer
delay
your
holiday
my
children
and
since
malarius
desires
it
we
will
stop
for
at
these
words
the
master
clapped
his
hands
all
the
pupils
rose
at
once
collected
their
books
and
arranged
themselves
in
four
lines
in
the
empty
spaces
between
the
benches
malarias
clapped
his
hands
a
second
time
the
column
started
and
marched
out
keeping
step
with
military
precision
at
a
third
signal
they
broke
their
ranks
and
took
to
flight
with
joyous
cries
in
a
few
seconds
they
were
scattered
around
the
blue
waters
of
the
fiord
where
might
be
seen
also
the
turf
roofs
of
the
village
of
noroe
chapter
ii
the
home
of
a
fisherman
in
noroe
the
house
of
hersebom
was
like
all
others
in
noroe
covered
by
a
turf
roof
and
built
of
enormous
timbers
of
in
the
scandinavian
fashion
the
two
large
rooms
were
separated
by
a
hall
in
the
center
which
led
to
the
where
the
canoes
were
kept
here
were
also
to
be
seen
the
and
the
codfish
which
they
dry
and
sell
these
two
rooms
were
used
both
as
and
bedrooms
they
had
a
sort
of
wooden
drawer
let
into
the
wall
with
its
mattress
and
skins
which
serve
for
beds
and
are
only
to
be
seen
at
night
this
arrangement
for
sleeping
with
the
bright
panels
and
the
large
open
where
a
blazing
fire
of
wood
was
always
kept
burning
gave
to
the
interior
of
the
most
humble
homes
an
appearance
of
neatness
and
domestic
luxury
unknown
to
the
peasantry
of
southern
europe
this
evening
all
the
family
were
gathered
round
the
where
a
huge
kettle
was
boiling
containing
sillsallat
or
smoked
herring
salmon
and
potatoes
hersebom
seated
in
a
high
wooden
chair
was
making
a
net
which
was
his
usual
occupation
when
he
was
not
on
the
sea
or
drying
his
fish
he
was
a
hardy
fisherman
whose
skin
had
been
bronzed
by
exposure
to
the
arctic
breezes
and
his
hair
was
gray
although
he
was
still
in
the
prime
of
life
his
son
otto
a
great
boy
fourteen
years
old
who
bore
a
strong
resemblance
to
him
and
who
was
destined
to
also
become
famous
as
a
fisherman
sat
near
him
at
present
he
was
occupied
in
solving
the
mysteries
of
the
rule
of
three
covering
a
little
slate
with
figures
although
his
large
hands
looked
as
if
they
would
be
much
more
at
home
handling
the
oars
erik
seated
before
the
was
absorbed
in
a
volume
of
history
that
malarius
had
lent
him
katrina
hersebom
the
goodwife
was
occupied
peacefully
with
her
while
little
vanda
a
blonde
of
ten
years
was
seated
on
a
stool
knitting
a
large
stocking
with
red
wool
at
their
feet
a
large
dog
of
a
color
with
wool
as
thick
as
that
of
a
sheep
lay
curled
up
sound
asleep
for
more
than
one
hour
the
silence
had
been
unbroken
and
the
copper
lamp
suspended
over
their
heads
and
filled
with
fish
oil
lighted
softly
this
tranquil
interior
to
tell
the
truth
the
silence
became
oppressive
to
dame
katrina
who
for
some
moments
had
betrayed
the
desire
of
unloosing
her
tongue
at
last
she
could
keep
quiet
no
longer
you
have
worked
long
enough
for
she
said
it
is
time
to
lay
the
cloth
for
supper
without
a
word
of
expostulation
erik
lifted
his
large
book
and
seated
himself
nearer
the
whilst
vanda
laid
aside
her
knitting
and
going
to
the
buffet
brought
out
the
plates
and
spoons
did
you
say
otto
asked
the
little
girl
that
our
erik
answered
the
doctor
very
well
very
well
indeed
said
otto
enthusiastically
he
talked
like
a
book
in
fact
i
do
not
know
where
he
learned
it
all
the
more
questions
the
doctor
asked
the
more
he
had
to
answer
the
words
came
and
came
malarius
was
well
satisfied
with
him
i
am
also
said
vanda
gravely
oh
we
were
all
well
pleased
if
you
could
have
seen
mother
how
the
children
all
listened
with
their
mouths
open
we
were
only
afraid
that
our
turn
would
come
but
erik
was
not
afraid
and
answered
the
doctor
as
he
would
have
answered
the
master
stop
malarius
is
as
good
as
the
doctor
and
quite
as
learned
cried
erik
whom
their
praises
seemed
to
annoy
the
old
fisherman
gave
him
an
approving
smile
you
are
right
little
boy
he
said
malarius
if
he
chose
could
be
the
superior
of
all
the
doctors
in
the
town
and
besides
he
does
not
make
use
of
his
scientific
knowledge
to
ruin
poor
people
has
doctor
schwaryencrona
ruined
any
one
asked
erik
with
curiosity
well
if
he
has
not
done
so
it
has
not
been
his
fault
do
you
think
that
i
have
taken
any
pleasure
in
the
erection
of
his
factory
which
is
sending
forth
its
smoke
on
the
borders
of
our
fiord
your
mother
can
tell
you
that
formerly
we
manufactured
our
own
oil
and
that
we
sold
it
easily
in
bergen
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
to
two
hundred
kroners
a
year
but
that
is
all
ended
now
nobody
will
buy
the
brown
oil
or
if
they
do
they
pay
so
little
for
it
that
it
is
not
worth
while
to
take
the
journey
we
must
be
satisfied
with
selling
the
livers
to
the
factory
and
god
only
knows
how
this
tiresome
doctor
has
managed
to
get
them
for
such
a
low
price
i
hardly
realize
kroners
now
and
i
have
to
take
twice
as
much
trouble
as
formerly
ah
well
i
say
it
is
not
just
and
the
doctor
would
do
better
to
look
after
his
patients
in
stockholm
instead
of
coming
here
to
take
away
our
trade
by
which
we
earn
our
bread
after
these
bitter
words
they
were
all
silent
they
heard
nothing
for
some
minutes
except
the
clicking
of
the
plates
as
vanda
arranged
them
whilst
her
mother
emptied
the
contents
of
the
pot
into
a
large
dish
erik
reflected
deeply
upon
what
hersebom
had
said
numerous
objections
presented
themselves
to
his
mind
and
as
he
was
candor
itself
he
could
not
help
speaking
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
a
right
to
regret
your
former
profits
father
he
said
but
is
it
just
to
accuse
doctor
schwaryencrona
of
having
diminished
them
is
not
his
oil
worth
more
than
the
article
ah
it
is
clearer
that
is
all
it
does
not
taste
as
strong
as
ours
they
say
and
that
is
the
reason
why
all
the
fine
ladies
in
the
town
prefer
it
no
doubt
but
it
does
not
do
any
more
good
to
the
lungs
of
sick
people
than
our
oil
but
for
some
reason
or
other
they
buy
it
in
preference
and
since
it
is
a
very
useful
medicine
it
is
essential
that
the
public
should
experience
as
little
disgust
as
possible
in
taking
it
therefore
if
a
doctor
finds
out
a
method
of
making
it
more
palatable
is
it
not
his
duty
to
make
use
of
his
discovery
master
hersebom
scratched
his
ear
doubtless
he
said
reluctantly
it
is
his
duty
as
a
doctor
but
that
is
no
reason
why
he
should
prevent
poor
fishermen
from
getting
their
living
i
believe
the
doctor
factory
gives
employment
to
three
hundred
whilst
there
were
only
twenty
in
noroe
at
the
time
of
which
you
speak
objected
erik
timidly
you
are
right
and
that
is
why
the
business
is
no
longer
worth
anything
said
hersebom
come
supper
is
ready
seat
yourselves
at
the
table
said
dame
katrina
who
saw
that
the
discussion
was
in
danger
of
becoming
unpleasantly
warm
erik
understood
that
further
opposition
on
his
part
would
be
out
of
place
and
he
did
not
answer
the
last
argument
of
his
father
but
took
his
habitual
seat
beside
vanda
were
the
doctor
and
malarius
friends
in
childhood
he
asked
in
order
to
give
a
turn
to
the
conversation
yes
answered
the
fisherman
as
he
seated
himself
at
the
table
they
were
both
born
in
noroe
and
i
can
remember
when
they
played
around
the
although
they
are
both
ten
years
older
than
i
am
malarius
was
the
son
of
the
physician
and
doctor
schwaryencrona
only
the
son
of
a
simple
fisherman
but
he
has
risen
in
the
world
and
they
say
that
he
is
now
worth
millions
and
that
his
residence
in
stockholm
is
a
perfect
palace
oh
learning
is
a
fine
thing
after
uttering
this
aphorism
the
brave
man
took
a
spoon
to
help
the
smoking
fish
and
potatoes
when
a
knock
at
the
door
made
him
pause
may
i
come
in
master
hersebom
said
a
voice
and
without
waiting
for
permission
the
person
who
had
spoken
entered
bringing
with
him
a
great
blast
of
icy
air
doctor
schwaryencrona
cried
the
three
children
while
the
father
and
mother
rose
quickly
my
dear
hersebom
said
the
doctor
taking
the
fisherman
hand
we
have
not
seen
each
other
for
many
years
but
i
have
not
forgotten
your
excellent
father
and
thought
i
might
call
and
see
a
friend
of
my
childhood
the
worthy
man
felt
a
little
ashamed
of
the
accusations
which
he
had
so
recently
made
against
his
visitor
and
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
he
contented
himself
therefore
with
returning
the
doctor
shake
of
the
hand
cordially
and
smiling
a
welcome
whilst
his
good
wife
was
more
demonstrative
quick
otto
erik
help
the
doctor
to
take
off
his
overcoat
and
you
vanda
prepare
another
place
at
the
table
she
said
for
like
all
norwegian
housekeepers
she
was
very
hospitable
will
you
do
us
the
honor
doctor
of
eating
a
morsel
with
us
indeed
i
would
not
refuse
you
may
be
sure
if
i
had
the
least
appetite
for
i
see
you
have
a
very
tempting
dish
before
you
but
it
is
not
an
hour
since
i
took
supper
with
malarius
and
i
certainly
would
not
have
called
so
early
if
i
had
thought
you
would
be
at
the
table
it
would
give
me
great
pleasure
if
you
would
resume
your
seats
and
eat
your
supper
oh
doctor
implored
the
good
wife
at
least
you
will
not
refuse
some
and
a
cup
of
tea
i
will
gladly
take
a
cup
of
tea
but
on
condition
that
you
eat
your
supper
first
answered
the
doctor
seating
himself
in
the
large
vanda
immediately
placed
the
on
the
fire
and
disappeared
in
the
neighboring
room
the
rest
of
the
family
understanding
with
native
courtesy
that
it
would
annoy
their
guest
if
they
did
not
do
as
he
wished
began
to
eat
their
supper
in
two
minutes
the
doctor
was
quite
at
his
ease
he
stirred
the
fire
and
warmed
his
legs
in
the
blaze
of
the
dry
wood
that
katrina
had
thrown
on
before
going
to
supper
he
talked
about
old
times
and
old
friends
those
who
had
disappeared
and
those
who
remained
about
the
changes
that
had
taken
place
even
in
bergen
he
made
himself
quite
at
home
and
what
was
more
remarkable
he
succeeded
in
making
hersebom
eat
his
supper
vanda
now
entered
carrying
a
large
wooden
dish
upon
which
was
a
saucer
which
she
offered
so
graciously
to
the
doctor
that
he
could
not
refuse
it
it
was
the
famous
snorgas
of
norway
slices
of
smoked
reindeer
and
shreds
of
herring
and
red
pepper
minced
up
and
laid
between
slices
of
black
bread
spiced
cheese
and
other
condiments
which
they
eat
at
any
hour
to
produce
an
appetite
it
succeeded
so
well
in
the
doctor
case
that
although
he
only
took
it
out
of
politeness
he
was
soon
able
to
do
honor
to
some
preserved
mulberries
which
were
dame
katrina
special
pride
and
so
thirsty
that
he
drank
seven
or
eight
cups
of
tea
hersebom
brought
out
a
bottle
of
schiedam
which
he
had
bought
of
a
hollander
then
supper
being
ended
the
doctor
accepted
an
enormous
pipe
which
his
host
offered
him
and
smoked
away
to
their
general
satisfaction
by
this
time
all
feeling
of
constraint
had
passed
away
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
doctor
had
always
been
a
member
of
the
family
they
joked
and
laughed
and
were
the
best
of
friends
in
the
world
until
the
old
clock
of
varnished
wood
struck
ten
my
good
friends
it
is
growing
late
said
the
doctor
if
you
will
send
the
children
to
bed
we
will
talk
about
more
serious
matters
upon
a
sign
from
dame
katrina
otto
erik
and
vanda
bade
them
and
left
the
room
you
wonder
why
i
have
come
said
the
doctor
after
a
moments
silence
fixing
his
penetrating
glance
upon
the
fisherman
my
guests
are
always
welcome
answered
the
fisherman
sententiously
yes
i
know
that
noroe
is
famous
for
hospitality
but
you
must
certainly
have
asked
yourself
what
motive
could
have
induced
me
to
leave
the
society
of
my
old
friend
malarius
and
come
to
you
i
am
sure
that
dame
hersebom
has
some
suspicion
of
my
motive
we
shall
know
when
you
tell
us
replied
the
good
woman
diplomatically
well
said
the
doctor
with
a
sigh
since
you
will
not
help
me
i
must
face
it
alone
your
son
erik
master
hersebom
is
a
most
remarkable
child
i
do
not
complain
of
him
answered
the
fisherman
he
is
singularly
intelligent
and
well
informed
for
his
age
continued
the
doctor
i
questioned
him
in
school
and
i
was
very
much
surprised
by
the
extraordinary
ability
which
his
answers
displayed
i
was
also
astonished
when
i
learned
his
name
to
see
that
he
bore
no
resemblance
to
you
nor
indeed
to
any
of
the
natives
of
this
country
the
fisherman
and
his
wife
remained
silent
and
motionless
to
be
brief
continued
the
doctor
with
visible
impatience
this
child
not
only
interests
me
he
puzzles
me
i
have
talked
with
malarius
who
told
me
that
he
was
not
your
son
but
that
he
had
been
cast
on
your
shore
by
a
shipwreck
and
that
you
took
him
in
and
adopted
him
bringing
him
up
as
your
own
and
bestowing
your
name
upon
him
this
is
true
is
it
not
yes
doctor
answered
hersebom
gravely
if
he
is
not
our
son
by
birth
he
is
in
love
and
affection
said
katrina
with
moist
eyes
and
trembling
hands
between
him
and
otto
and
vanda
we
have
made
no
difference
we
have
never
thought
of
him
only
as
our
own
child
these
sentiments
do
you
both
honor
said
the
doctor
moved
by
the
emotion
of
the
brave
woman
but
i
beg
of
you
my
friends
relate
to
me
the
history
of
this
child
i
have
come
to
hear
it
and
i
assure
you
that
i
wish
him
well
the
fisherman
appeared
to
hesitate
a
moment
then
seeing
that
the
doctor
was
waiting
impatiently
for
him
to
speak
he
concluded
to
gratify
him
you
have
been
told
the
truth
he
said
regretfully
the
child
is
not
our
son
twelve
years
ago
i
was
fishing
near
the
island
at
the
entrance
of
the
fiord
near
the
open
sea
you
know
it
is
surrounded
by
a
sand
bank
and
that
are
plentiful
there
after
a
good
day
work
i
drew
in
my
lines
and
was
going
to
hoist
my
sail
when
something
white
moving
upon
the
water
about
a
mile
off
attracted
my
attention
the
sea
was
calm
and
there
was
nothing
pressing
to
hurry
me
home
so
i
had
the
curiosity
to
go
and
see
what
this
white
object
was
in
ten
minutes
i
had
reached
it
it
was
a
little
wicker
cradle
enveloped
in
a
woolen
cloth
and
strongly
tied
to
a
buoy
i
drew
it
toward
me
an
emotion
which
i
could
not
understand
seized
me
i
beheld
a
sleeping
infant
about
seven
or
eight
months
old
whose
little
fists
were
tightly
clinched
he
looked
a
little
pale
and
cold
but
did
not
appear
to
have
suffered
much
from
his
adventurous
voyage
if
one
might
judge
by
his
lusty
screams
when
he
awoke
as
he
did
immediately
when
he
no
longer
felt
himself
rocked
by
the
waves
our
little
otto
was
over
two
years
old
and
i
knew
how
to
manage
such
little
rogues
i
rolled
up
a
bit
of
rag
dipped
it
in
some
de
and
water
that
i
had
with
me
and
gave
it
to
him
to
suck
this
quieted
him
at
once
and
he
seemed
to
enjoy
the
cordial
but
i
knew
that
he
would
not
be
quiet
long
therefore
i
made
all
haste
to
return
to
noroe
i
had
untied
the
cradle
and
placed
it
in
the
boat
at
my
feet
and
while
i
attended
to
my
sail
i
watched
the
poor
little
one
and
asked
myself
where
it
could
possibly
have
come
from
doubtless
from
some
shipwrecked
vessel
a
fierce
tempest
had
been
raging
during
the
night
and
there
had
been
many
disasters
but
by
what
means
had
this
infant
escaped
the
fate
of
those
who
had
had
the
charge
of
him
how
had
they
thought
of
tying
him
to
the
buoy
how
many
hours
had
he
been
floating
on
the
waves
where
were
his
father
and
mother
those
who
loved
him
but
all
these
questions
had
to
remain
unanswered
the
poor
baby
was
unable
to
give
us
any
information
in
half
an
hour
i
was
at
home
and
gave
my
new
possession
to
katrina
we
had
a
cow
then
and
she
was
immediately
pressed
into
service
as
a
nurse
for
the
infant
he
was
so
pretty
so
smiling
so
rosy
when
he
had
been
fed
and
warmed
before
the
fire
that
we
fell
in
love
with
him
at
once
just
the
same
as
if
he
had
been
our
own
and
then
you
see
we
took
care
of
him
we
brought
him
up
and
we
have
never
made
any
difference
between
him
and
our
own
two
children
is
it
not
true
wife
added
hersebom
turning
toward
katrina
very
true
the
poor
little
one
answered
the
good
dame
drying
her
eyes
which
this
recital
had
filled
with
tears
and
he
is
our
child
now
for
we
have
adopted
him
i
do
not
know
why
malarius
should
say
anything
to
the
contrary
it
is
true
said
hersebom
and
i
do
not
see
that
it
concerns
any
one
but
ourselves
that
is
so
said
the
doctor
in
a
conciliatory
tone
but
you
must
not
accuse
malarius
of
being
indiscreet
i
was
struck
with
the
physiognomy
of
the
child
and
i
begged
my
friend
confidentially
to
relate
his
history
he
told
me
that
erik
believed
himself
to
be
your
son
and
that
every
one
in
noroe
had
forgotten
how
he
had
become
yours
therefore
you
see
i
took
care
not
to
speak
until
the
children
had
been
sent
to
bed
you
say
that
he
was
about
seven
or
eight
months
old
when
you
found
him
about
that
he
had
already
four
teeth
the
little
brigand
and
i
assure
you
that
it
was
not
long
before
he
began
to
use
them
said
hersebom
laughing
oh
he
was
a
superb
child
said
katrinn
eagerly
he
was
so
white
and
strong
and
plump
and
such
arms
and
legs
you
should
have
seen
them
how
was
he
dressed
asked
schwaryencrona
hersebom
did
not
answer
but
his
wife
was
less
discreet
like
a
little
prince
she
answered
imagine
a
robe
of
piqu√®
trimmed
all
over
with
lace
a
pelisse
of
quilted
satin
a
cloak
of
white
velvet
and
a
little
cap
the
son
of
a
king
could
not
have
more
everything
he
had
was
beautiful
but
you
can
see
for
yourself
for
i
have
kept
them
all
just
as
they
were
you
may
be
sure
that
we
did
not
dress
the
baby
in
them
oh
no
i
put
otto
little
garments
on
him
which
i
had
laid
away
and
which
also
served
later
on
for
vanda
but
his
outfit
is
here
and
i
will
show
it
to
you
while
she
was
speaking
the
worthy
woman
knelt
down
before
a
large
oaken
chest
with
an
antique
lock
and
after
lifting
the
lid
began
searching
the
compartments
she
drew
out
one
by
one
all
the
garments
of
which
she
had
spoken
and
displayed
them
with
pride
before
the
eyes
of
the
doctor
she
also
showed
the
linen
which
was
exquisitely
fine
a
little
quilt
of
silk
and
a
pair
of
white
merino
boots
all
the
articles
were
marked
with
the
initials
elegantly
embroidered
as
the
doctor
saw
at
a
glance
is
that
why
you
named
the
child
erik
he
asked
precisely
answered
katrina
who
it
was
evident
enjoyed
this
exhibition
while
her
husband
face
grew
more
gloomy
see
she
said
this
is
the
most
beautiful
of
all
he
wore
it
around
his
neck
and
she
drew
from
its
box
a
rattle
of
coral
and
gold
suspended
from
a
little
chain
the
initials
were
here
surrounded
by
a
latin
motto
semper
idem
we
thought
at
first
it
was
the
baby
name
but
malarius
told
us
it
meant
the
same
she
continued
seeing
that
the
doctor
was
trying
to
decipher
the
motto
malarius
told
you
the
truth
said
the
doctor
it
is
evident
the
child
belonged
to
a
rich
and
distinguished
family
he
added
while
katrina
replaced
the
babe
outfit
in
the
oaken
chest
have
you
any
idea
what
country
he
came
from
how
could
we
know
anything
about
it
since
i
found
him
on
the
sea
replied
hersebom
yes
but
the
cradle
was
attached
to
a
buoy
you
said
and
it
is
customary
on
all
vessels
to
write
on
the
buoy
the
name
of
the
ship
to
which
it
belongs
answered
the
doctor
fixing
his
penetrating
eyes
upon
those
of
the
fisherman
doubtless
said
the
latter
hanging
his
head
well
this
buoy
what
name
did
it
bear
doctor
i
am
not
a
i
can
read
my
own
language
a
little
but
as
for
foreign
tongues
and
then
it
was
so
long
ago
however
you
ought
to
be
able
to
remember
something
about
it
and
doubtless
you
showed
it
to
malarius
with
the
rest
of
the
articles
make
a
little
effort
hersebom
was
not
this
name
inscribed
on
the
buoy
i
believe
it
was
something
like
that
answered
the
fisherman
vaguely
it
is
a
strange
name
to
what
country
does
it
belong
in
your
judgment
mr
hersebom
how
should
i
know
have
i
ever
been
beyond
the
shores
of
noroe
and
bergen
except
once
or
twice
to
fish
off
the
coast
of
greenland
and
iceland
answered
the
good
man
in
a
tone
which
grew
more
and
more
morose
i
think
it
is
either
an
english
or
a
german
name
said
the
doctor
taking
no
notice
of
his
crossness
it
would
be
easy
to
decide
on
account
of
the
shape
of
the
letters
if
i
could
see
the
buoy
have
you
preserved
it
by
my
faith
no
it
was
burnt
up
ages
ago
answered
hersebom
triumphantly
as
near
as
malarius
could
remember
the
letters
were
roman
said
the
doctor
as
if
he
were
talking
to
himself
and
the
letters
on
the
linen
certainly
are
it
is
therefore
probable
that
the
was
not
a
german
vessel
i
think
it
was
an
english
one
is
not
this
your
opinion
mr
hersebom
well
i
have
thought
little
about
it
replied
the
fisherman
whether
it
was
english
german
or
russian
makes
no
difference
to
me
for
many
years
according
to
all
appearances
they
have
lain
beneath
the
sea
which
alone
could
tell
the
secret
but
you
have
doubtless
made
some
effort
to
discover
the
family
to
whom
the
child
belonged
said
the
doctor
whose
glasses
seemed
to
shine
with
irony
you
doubtless
wrote
to
the
governor
of
bergen
and
had
him
insert
an
advertisement
in
the
journals
i
cried
the
fisherman
i
did
nothing
of
the
kind
god
knows
where
the
baby
came
from
why
should
i
trouble
myself
about
it
can
i
afford
to
spend
money
to
find
his
people
who
perhaps
care
little
for
him
put
yourself
in
my
place
doctor
i
am
not
a
millionaire
and
you
may
be
sure
if
we
had
spent
all
we
had
we
should
have
discovered
nothing
i
have
done
the
best
i
could
we
have
raised
the
little
one
as
our
own
son
we
have
loved
him
and
taken
care
of
him
even
more
than
the
two
others
if
it
were
possible
interrupted
katrina
drying
her
eyes
on
the
corner
of
her
apron
if
we
have
anything
to
reproach
ourselves
for
it
is
for
bestowing
upon
him
too
large
a
share
of
our
tenderness
dame
hersebom
you
must
not
do
me
the
injustice
to
suppose
that
your
kindness
to
the
little
shipwrecked
child
inspires
me
with
any
other
feeling
than
the
greatest
admiration
said
the
doctor
no
you
must
not
think
such
a
thing
but
if
you
wish
me
to
speak
frankly
i
must
say
that
this
tenderness
has
blinded
you
to
your
duty
you
should
have
endeavored
to
discover
the
family
of
the
infant
as
far
as
your
means
permitted
there
was
perfect
silence
for
a
few
minutes
it
is
possible
that
we
have
done
wrong
said
hersebom
who
had
hung
his
head
under
this
reproach
but
what
is
done
can
not
be
altered
erik
belongs
to
us
now
and
i
do
not
wish
any
one
to
speak
to
him
about
these
old
reminiscences
you
need
have
no
fear
i
will
not
betray
your
confidence
answered
the
doctor
rising
i
must
leave
you
my
good
friends
and
i
wish
you
a
night
free
from
remorse
he
added
gravely
then
he
put
on
his
fur
cloak
and
shook
hands
cordially
with
his
hosts
and
being
conducted
to
the
door
by
hersebom
he
took
the
road
toward
his
factory
the
fisherman
stood
for
a
moment
on
the
threshold
watching
his
retreating
figure
in
the
moonlight
what
a
devil
of
a
man
he
murmured
as
at
last
he
closed
his
door
chapter
iii
hersebom
reflections
the
next
morning
schwaryencrona
had
just
finished
breakfast
with
his
overseer
after
having
made
a
thorough
inspection
of
his
factory
when
he
saw
a
person
enter
whom
he
did
not
at
first
recognize
as
hersebom
he
was
clothed
in
his
holiday
suit
his
embroidered
waistcoat
his
furred
riding
coat
and
his
high
hat
and
the
fisherman
looked
very
different
to
what
he
did
in
his
working
clothes
but
what
made
the
change
more
apparent
was
the
deep
sadness
and
humility
portrayed
in
his
countenance
his
eyes
were
red
and
looked
as
if
he
had
had
no
sleep
all
the
night
this
was
in
fact
the
case
hersebom
who
up
to
this
time
had
never
felt
his
conscience
trouble
him
had
passed
hours
of
sad
remorse
on
his
mattress
of
skins
toward
morning
he
had
exchanged
confidences
with
dame
katrina
who
had
also
been
unable
to
close
her
eyes
wife
i
have
been
thinking
of
what
the
doctor
said
to
us
he
said
after
several
hours
of
wakefulness
i
have
been
thinking
of
it
also
ever
since
he
left
us
answered
his
worthy
helpmate
it
is
my
opinion
that
there
is
some
truth
in
what
he
said
and
that
we
have
perhaps
acted
more
egotistically
than
we
should
have
done
who
knows
but
that
the
child
may
have
a
right
to
some
great
fortune
of
which
he
is
deprived
by
our
negligence
who
knows
if
his
family
have
not
mourned
for
him
these
twelve
years
and
they
could
justly
accuse
us
of
having
made
no
attempt
to
restore
him
to
them
this
is
precisely
what
i
have
been
saying
to
myself
answered
katrina
sighing
if
his
mother
is
living
what
frightful
anguish
the
poor
woman
must
have
endured
in
believing
that
her
infant
was
drowned
i
put
myself
in
her
place
and
imagine
that
we
had
lost
otto
in
this
manner
we
would
never
have
been
consoled
it
is
not
thoughts
of
his
mother
that
trouble
me
for
according
to
all
appearances
she
is
dead
said
hersebom
after
a
silence
broken
only
by
their
sighs
how
can
we
suppose
that
an
infant
of
that
age
would
travel
without
her
or
that
it
would
have
been
tied
to
a
buoy
and
left
to
take
its
chances
on
the
ocean
if
she
had
been
living
that
is
true
but
what
do
we
know
about
it
after
all
perhaps
she
also
has
had
a
miraculous
escape
perhaps
some
one
has
taken
her
infant
from
her
this
idea
has
often
occurred
to
me
answered
hersebom
some
one
might
be
interested
in
his
disappearance
to
expose
so
young
a
child
to
such
a
hazardous
proceeding
is
so
extraordinary
that
such
conjectures
are
possible
and
in
this
case
we
have
become
accomplices
of
a
crime
we
have
contributed
to
its
success
is
it
not
horrible
to
think
of
and
we
thought
we
were
doing
such
a
good
and
charitable
work
in
adopting
the
poor
little
one
oh
it
is
evident
that
we
had
no
malicious
intentions
we
nourished
it
and
brought
it
up
as
well
as
we
were
able
but
that
does
not
prevent
me
from
seeing
that
we
have
acted
rashly
and
the
little
one
will
have
a
right
to
reproach
us
some
of
these
days
we
need
not
be
afraid
of
that
i
am
sure
but
it
is
too
bad
that
we
should
feel
at
this
late
day
that
we
have
done
anything
for
which
we
must
reproach
ourselves
how
strange
it
is
that
the
same
action
regarded
from
a
different
point
of
view
can
be
judged
so
differently
i
never
would
have
thought
of
such
a
thing
and
yet
a
few
words
from
the
doctor
seems
to
have
turned
my
brain
thus
these
good
people
talked
during
the
night
the
result
of
their
nocturnal
conversation
was
that
hersebom
resolved
to
call
upon
the
doctor
and
ask
him
what
they
could
do
to
make
amends
for
the
error
of
which
they
had
been
guilty
schwaryencrona
did
not
revert
to
the
conversation
which
had
taken
place
the
previous
evening
he
appeared
to
regard
the
visit
of
the
fisherman
as
simply
an
act
of
politeness
and
received
him
cordially
and
began
talking
about
the
weather
and
the
price
of
fish
hersebom
tried
to
lead
the
conversation
toward
the
subject
which
occupied
his
mind
he
spoke
of
malarius
school
and
at
last
said
plainly
doctor
my
wife
and
i
have
been
thinking
all
night
about
what
you
said
to
us
last
evening
about
the
boy
we
never
thought
that
we
were
doing
him
a
wrong
in
educating
him
as
our
son
but
you
have
changed
our
opinion
and
we
want
to
know
what
you
would
advise
us
to
do
in
order
to
repair
our
fault
do
you
think
that
we
still
ought
to
seek
to
find
erik
family
it
is
never
too
late
to
do
our
duty
said
the
doctor
although
the
task
is
certainly
much
more
difficult
now
than
it
would
have
been
at
first
will
you
interest
yourself
in
the
matter
i
will
with
pleasure
answered
the
doctor
and
i
promise
you
to
use
every
exertion
to
fulfill
it
upon
one
condition
that
is
that
you
let
me
take
the
boy
to
stockholm
if
hersebom
had
been
struck
on
the
head
with
a
club
he
would
not
have
been
more
astonished
than
he
was
by
this
proposal
intrust
erik
to
you
send
him
to
stockholm
why
should
i
do
this
doctor
he
asked
in
an
altered
voice
i
will
tell
you
my
attention
was
drawn
to
the
child
not
only
on
account
of
his
physical
appearance
which
was
so
different
to
that
of
his
companions
but
by
his
great
intelligence
and
his
evident
taste
for
study
before
knowing
the
circumstances
which
had
brought
him
to
noroe
i
said
to
myself
that
it
was
a
shame
to
leave
a
boy
so
gifted
in
a
village
school
even
under
such
a
master
as
malarius
for
here
there
is
nothing
to
assist
in
the
development
of
his
exceptionally
great
faculties
there
are
no
museums
nor
scientific
collections
nor
libraries
nor
competitors
who
are
worthy
of
him
i
felt
a
strong
desire
to
give
him
the
advantages
of
a
complete
education
you
can
understand
that
after
the
confidence
which
you
have
bestowed
upon
me
i
am
more
anxious
to
do
so
than
before
you
can
see
hersebom
that
your
adopted
son
belongs
to
some
rich
and
distinguished
family
if
i
succeed
in
finding
them
would
you
wish
to
restore
to
them
a
child
educated
in
a
village
and
deprived
of
this
education
without
which
he
will
feel
out
of
place
among
his
kindred
it
is
not
reasonable
and
you
are
too
sensible
not
to
understand
it
hersebom
hung
his
head
without
his
being
aware
of
it
two
large
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
but
then
he
said
this
would
be
an
entire
separation
before
we
ever
know
whether
the
child
will
find
his
relations
he
must
be
taken
from
his
home
it
is
asking
too
much
doctor
asking
too
much
of
my
wife
the
child
is
happy
with
us
why
can
he
not
be
left
alone
at
least
until
he
is
sure
of
a
better
one
happy
how
do
you
know
that
he
will
be
so
when
he
grows
older
how
can
you
tell
whether
he
may
not
regret
having
been
saved
intelligent
and
superior
as
he
will
be
perhaps
he
would
be
stifled
with
the
life
which
you
would
offer
him
in
noroe
but
doctor
this
life
which
you
disdain
is
good
enough
for
us
why
is
it
not
good
enough
for
him
i
do
not
disdain
it
said
the
doctor
nobody
admires
and
honors
those
who
work
more
than
i
do
do
you
believe
hersebom
that
i
forget
my
birth
my
father
and
grandfather
were
fishermen
like
yourself
and
it
is
just
because
they
were
so
as
to
educate
me
that
i
appreciate
the
value
of
it
and
i
would
assure
it
to
a
child
who
merits
it
it
is
his
interest
alone
which
guides
me
i
beg
of
you
to
believe
ah
what
do
i
know
about
it
erik
will
be
almost
grown
up
when
you
have
made
a
gentleman
of
him
and
he
will
not
know
how
to
use
his
arms
then
if
you
do
not
find
his
family
which
is
more
than
possible
since
twelve
years
have
passed
since
i
found
him
what
a
beautiful
future
we
are
preparing
for
him
do
you
not
see
doctor
that
a
fisherman
life
is
a
brave
one
better
than
any
other
with
a
good
boat
under
his
feet
and
four
or
five
dozen
of
at
the
end
of
his
lines
a
norwegian
fisherman
need
have
no
fear
nor
be
indebted
to
any
one
you
say
that
erik
would
not
be
happy
leading
such
a
life
permit
me
to
believe
the
contrary
i
know
the
child
well
he
loves
his
books
but
above
all
he
loves
the
sea
it
also
almost
seems
as
if
he
felt
that
he
had
been
rocked
upon
it
and
all
the
museums
in
the
world
would
not
console
him
for
the
loss
of
it
but
we
have
the
sea
around
us
also
at
stockholm
said
the
doctor
smiling
touched
in
spite
of
himself
by
this
affectionate
resistance
well
said
the
fisherman
crossing
his
arms
what
do
you
wish
to
do
what
do
you
propose
doctor
there
you
see
after
all
the
necessity
of
doing
something
well
this
is
my
proposition
erik
is
twelve
years
old
nearly
thirteen
and
he
appears
to
be
highly
gifted
we
will
say
nothing
about
his
origin
he
is
worthy
of
being
supplied
with
the
means
of
developing
and
utilizing
his
faculties
that
is
all
we
need
trouble
ourselves
about
at
present
i
am
rich
and
i
have
no
children
i
will
undertake
to
furnish
the
means
and
give
him
the
best
masters
and
all
possible
facilities
for
profiting
by
their
instructions
i
will
do
this
for
two
years
during
this
time
i
will
make
inquiries
insert
advertisements
in
the
newspapers
make
every
possible
exertion
move
heaven
and
earth
to
discover
his
parents
if
i
do
not
find
them
in
two
years
we
shall
never
do
it
if
his
relatives
are
found
they
will
naturally
decide
his
future
career
in
life
if
we
do
not
find
them
i
will
send
erik
back
to
you
he
will
then
be
fifteen
years
old
he
will
have
seen
something
of
the
world
the
hour
will
have
arrived
to
tell
him
the
truth
about
his
birth
then
aided
by
our
advice
and
the
opinions
of
his
teachers
he
can
choose
what
path
he
would
prefer
to
follow
if
he
wishes
to
become
a
fisherman
i
will
not
oppose
it
if
he
wishes
to
continue
his
studies
i
engage
to
furnish
the
means
for
him
to
follow
any
profession
that
he
may
choose
does
this
seem
a
reasonable
proposition
to
you
more
than
reasonable
it
is
wisdom
itself
issuing
from
your
lips
doctor
said
hersebom
overcome
in
spite
of
himself
see
what
it
is
to
have
an
education
he
continued
shaking
his
head
the
difficulty
will
be
to
repeat
all
you
have
said
to
my
wife
when
will
you
take
the
child
away
i
can
not
delay
my
return
to
stockholm
any
longer
hersebom
heaved
a
deep
sigh
which
was
almost
a
sob
so
soon
he
said
well
what
must
be
must
be
i
will
go
and
talk
to
my
wife
about
it
yes
do
so
and
consult
malarius
also
you
will
find
that
he
is
of
my
opinion
i
do
not
doubt
it
answered
the
fisherman
with
a
sad
smile
he
shook
the
hand
which
schwaryencrona
held
out
to
him
and
went
away
looking
very
thoughtful
that
evening
before
dinner
the
doctor
again
directed
his
steps
toward
the
dwelling
of
hersebom
he
found
the
family
assembled
round
the
hearth
as
they
were
the
evening
before
but
not
wearing
the
same
appearance
of
peaceful
happiness
the
father
was
seated
the
furthest
from
the
fire
silent
and
with
idle
hands
katrina
with
tears
in
her
eyes
held
erik
hands
between
her
own
whose
cheeks
were
reddened
by
the
hope
of
the
new
destiny
which
seemed
opening
before
him
but
who
looked
sad
at
leaving
all
whom
he
loved
and
who
did
not
know
what
feeling
he
ought
to
yield
to
little
vanda
face
was
hidden
in
her
father
knees
and
nothing
could
be
seen
except
her
long
braids
of
golden
hair
otto
also
greatly
troubled
at
this
proposed
separation
sat
motionless
beside
his
brother
how
sad
and
disconsolate
you
look
said
the
doctor
stopping
on
the
threshold
if
erik
were
about
to
set
out
on
a
distant
and
most
perilous
expedition
you
could
not
show
more
grief
he
is
not
going
to
do
anything
of
the
kind
i
assure
you
my
good
friends
stockholm
is
not
at
the
antipodes
and
the
child
is
not
going
away
forever
he
can
write
to
you
and
i
do
not
doubt
that
he
will
do
so
often
he
is
only
going
away
to
school
like
so
many
other
boys
in
two
years
he
will
return
tall
and
and
accomplished
i
hope
is
this
anything
to
feel
sad
about
seriously
it
is
not
reasonable
katrina
arose
with
the
natural
dignity
of
the
peasant
of
the
north
doctor
she
said
god
is
my
witness
that
i
am
profoundly
grateful
to
you
for
what
you
propose
to
do
for
erik
but
we
can
not
help
feeling
sad
because
of
his
departure
hersebom
has
explained
to
me
that
it
is
necessary
and
i
submit
do
not
think
that
i
shall
feel
no
regret
mother
said
erik
i
will
not
go
if
it
causes
you
such
pain
no
child
answered
the
worthy
woman
taking
him
in
her
arms
education
is
a
benefit
which
we
have
no
right
to
refuse
you
go
my
son
and
thank
the
doctor
who
has
provided
it
for
you
and
prove
to
him
by
constant
application
to
your
studies
that
you
appreciate
his
kindness
there
there
said
the
doctor
whose
glasses
were
dimmed
by
a
singular
cloudiness
let
us
rather
speak
of
practical
matters
that
will
be
better
you
know
do
you
not
that
we
must
set
out
very
early
and
that
you
must
have
everything
ready
we
will
go
by
sleigh
to
bergen
and
thence
by
railroad
erik
only
needs
a
change
of
linen
i
will
procure
everything
else
that
is
necessary
at
stockholm
everything
shall
be
ready
answered
dame
hersebom
vanda
she
added
with
norwegian
hospitality
the
doctor
is
still
standing
the
little
girl
hurriedly
pushed
a
large
toward
him
i
can
not
stay
said
the
doctor
i
promised
my
friend
malarius
to
dine
with
him
and
he
is
waiting
for
me
little
girl
he
said
laying
his
hand
gently
upon
vanda
blonde
head
i
hope
you
do
not
wish
me
any
harm
because
i
am
taking
your
brother
away
from
you
no
doctor
she
answered
gravely
erik
will
be
happier
with
you
he
was
not
intended
to
live
in
a
village
and
you
little
one
will
you
be
very
unhappy
without
him
the
shore
will
seem
deserted
she
answered
the
seagulls
will
look
for
him
without
finding
him
the
little
waves
will
be
astonished
because
they
no
longer
see
him
and
the
house
will
seem
empty
but
erik
will
be
contented
because
he
will
have
plenty
of
books
and
he
will
become
a
learned
man
and
his
little
sister
will
rejoice
in
his
happiness
is
it
not
so
my
child
said
the
doctor
kissing
the
forehead
of
the
little
girl
and
she
will
be
proud
of
him
when
he
returns
see
we
have
arranged
the
whole
matter
but
i
must
hurry
away
until
doctor
murmured
vanda
timidly
i
wish
to
ask
a
favor
of
you
speak
child
you
are
going
in
a
sleigh
you
said
i
wish
with
my
papa
and
permission
to
drive
you
to
the
first
relay
ah
ah
but
i
have
already
arranged
that
reguild
the
daughter
of
my
overseer
should
do
this
yes
i
know
it
but
she
is
willing
that
i
should
take
her
place
if
you
will
authorize
me
to
do
so
well
in
that
case
you
have
only
to
obtain
the
permission
of
your
father
and
mother
i
have
done
so
then
you
have
mine
also
dear
child
said
the
doctor
and
he
took
his
departure
the
next
morning
when
the
sleigh
stopped
before
the
door
of
hersebom
little
vanda
held
the
reins
according
to
her
desire
seated
upon
the
front
seat
she
was
going
to
drive
them
to
the
next
village
where
the
doctor
would
procure
another
horse
and
sleigh
and
thus
procure
relays
until
he
reached
bergen
this
new
kind
of
coachman
always
astonishes
a
stranger
but
it
is
the
custom
in
norway
and
sweden
the
men
would
think
it
a
loss
of
time
to
pursue
such
a
calling
and
it
is
not
rare
to
see
children
of
ten
or
twelve
years
of
age
managing
heavy
equipages
with
perfect
ease
the
doctor
was
already
installed
in
the
back
of
the
sleigh
nearly
hidden
by
his
furs
erik
took
his
seat
beside
vanda
after
having
tenderly
embraced
his
father
and
brother
who
contented
themselves
by
showing
by
their
mute
sadness
the
sorrow
which
his
departure
caused
them
but
the
good
katrina
was
more
open
in
the
expression
of
her
feelings
adieu
my
son
she
said
in
the
midst
of
her
tears
never
forget
what
you
have
learned
from
your
poor
parents
be
honest
and
brave
and
never
tell
a
lie
work
as
hard
as
you
can
always
protect
those
who
are
weaker
than
yourself
and
if
you
do
not
find
the
happiness
you
merit
come
back
and
seek
it
with
us
vanda
touched
the
horse
which
set
out
at
a
trot
and
made
the
bells
ring
the
air
was
cold
and
the
road
as
hard
as
glass
just
above
the
horizon
a
pale
sun
began
to
throw
his
golden
beams
upon
the
snowy
landscape
in
a
few
minutes
noroe
was
out
of
sight
behind
them
chapter
iv
at
stockholm
doctor
schwaryencrona
lived
in
a
magnificent
house
in
stockholm
it
was
in
the
oldest
and
most
aristocratic
quarter
of
the
charming
capital
which
is
one
of
the
most
pleasant
and
agreeable
in
europe
strangers
would
visit
it
much
more
frequently
if
it
were
better
known
and
more
fashionable
but
tourists
unfortunately
for
themselves
plan
their
journeys
much
upon
the
same
principle
as
they
purchase
their
hats
situated
between
lake
melar
and
the
baltic
it
is
built
upon
eight
small
islands
connected
by
innumerable
bridges
and
bordered
by
splendid
quays
enlivened
by
numerous
which
fulfill
the
duties
of
omnibuses
the
population
are
hardworking
gay
and
contented
they
are
the
most
hospitable
the
most
polite
and
the
best
educated
of
any
nation
in
europe
stockholm
with
its
libraries
its
museums
its
scientific
establishments
is
in
fact
the
athens
of
the
north
as
well
as
a
very
important
commercial
center
erik
however
had
not
recovered
from
the
sadness
incident
upon
parting
from
vanda
who
had
left
them
at
the
first
relay
their
parting
had
been
more
sorrowful
than
would
have
been
expected
at
their
age
but
they
had
not
been
able
to
conceal
their
emotion
when
the
carriage
stopped
before
a
large
brick
house
whose
double
windows
shone
resplendently
with
gaslight
erik
was
fairly
dazzled
the
copper
knocker
of
the
door
appeared
to
him
to
be
of
fine
gold
the
vestibule
paved
with
marble
and
ornamented
with
statues
bronze
torches
and
large
completed
his
amazement
a
footman
in
livery
removed
his
master
furs
and
inquired
after
his
health
with
the
affectionate
cordiality
which
is
habitual
with
swedish
servants
erik
looked
around
him
with
amazement
the
sound
of
voices
attracted
his
attention
toward
the
broad
oaken
staircase
covered
with
heavy
carpet
he
turned
and
saw
two
persons
whose
costumes
appeared
to
him
the
height
of
elegance
one
was
a
lady
with
gray
hair
and
of
medium
height
who
wore
a
dress
of
black
cloth
short
enough
to
show
her
red
stockings
with
yellow
and
her
buckled
shoes
an
enormous
bunch
of
keys
attached
to
a
steel
chain
hung
at
her
side
she
carried
her
head
high
and
looked
about
her
with
piercing
eyes
this
was
fru
or
madame
greta
maria
the
lady
in
charge
of
the
doctor
house
and
who
was
the
undisputed
autocrat
of
the
mansion
in
everything
that
pertained
to
the
culinary
or
domestic
affairs
behind
her
came
a
little
girl
eleven
or
twelve
years
old
who
appeared
to
erik
like
a
fairy
princess
instead
of
the
national
costume
the
only
one
which
he
had
ever
seen
worn
by
a
child
of
that
age
she
had
on
a
dress
of
deep
blue
velvet
over
which
her
yellow
hair
was
allowed
to
fall
loosely
she
wore
black
stockings
and
satin
shoes
a
knot
of
ribbon
was
poised
in
her
hair
like
a
butterfly
and
gave
a
little
color
to
her
pale
cheeks
while
her
large
eyes
shone
with
a
phosphorescent
light
how
delightful
uncle
to
have
you
back
again
have
you
had
a
pleasant
journey
she
cried
clasping
the
doctor
around
the
neck
she
hardly
deigned
to
cast
a
glance
at
erik
who
stood
modestly
aside
the
doctor
returned
her
caresses
and
shook
hands
with
his
housekeeper
then
he
made
a
sign
for
erik
to
advance
kajsa
and
dame
greta
i
ask
your
friendship
for
erik
hersebom
whom
i
have
brought
from
norway
with
me
he
said
and
you
my
boy
do
not
be
afraid
he
said
kindly
dame
greta
is
not
as
severe
as
she
looks
and
you
and
my
niece
kajsa
will
soon
be
the
best
of
friends
is
it
not
so
little
girl
he
added
pinching
gently
the
cheek
of
the
little
fairy
kajsa
only
responded
by
making
a
disdainful
face
as
for
the
housekeeper
she
did
not
appear
very
enthusiastic
over
the
new
recruit
thus
presented
to
her
notice
if
you
please
doctor
she
said
with
a
severe
air
as
they
ascended
the
staircase
may
i
ask
who
this
child
is
certainly
dame
greta
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
before
long
do
not
be
afraid
but
now
if
you
please
give
us
something
to
eat
in
the
matsal
or
the
table
was
beautifully
laid
with
damask
and
crystal
and
the
snorgas
was
ready
poor
erik
had
never
seen
a
table
covered
with
a
white
cloth
for
they
are
unknown
to
the
peasants
of
norway
who
hardly
use
plates
as
they
have
only
recently
been
introduced
and
many
of
them
still
eat
their
fish
on
rounds
of
black
bread
and
find
it
very
good
therefore
the
doctor
had
to
repeat
his
invitation
several
times
before
the
boy
took
his
seat
at
the
table
and
the
awkwardness
of
his
movements
caused
froken
or
miss
kajsa
to
cast
upon
him
more
than
one
ironical
glance
during
the
repast
however
his
journey
had
sharpened
his
appetite
and
this
was
of
great
assistance
to
him
the
snorgas
was
followed
by
a
dinner
that
would
have
frightened
a
frenchman
by
its
massive
solidity
and
would
have
sufficed
to
appease
the
appetites
of
a
battalion
of
infantry
after
a
long
march
soup
fish
bread
goose
stuffed
with
chestnuts
boiled
beef
flanked
with
a
mountain
of
vegetables
a
pyramid
of
potatoes
eggs
by
the
dozen
and
a
raisin
pudding
all
these
were
gallantly
attacked
and
dismantled
this
plentiful
repast
being
ended
almost
without
a
word
having
been
spoken
they
passed
into
the
parlor
a
large
wainscoted
room
with
six
windows
draped
with
heavy
curtains
large
enough
to
have
sufficed
a
parisian
artist
with
hangings
for
the
whole
apartment
the
doctor
seated
himself
in
a
corner
by
the
fire
in
a
large
leather
kajsa
took
her
place
at
his
feet
upon
a
footstool
whilst
erik
intimidated
and
ill
at
ease
approached
one
of
the
windows
and
would
have
gladly
hidden
himself
in
its
deep
embrasure
but
the
doctor
did
not
leave
him
alone
long
come
and
warm
yourself
my
boy
he
said
in
his
sonorous
voice
and
tell
us
what
you
think
of
stockholm
the
streets
are
very
black
and
very
narrow
and
the
houses
are
very
high
said
erik
yes
a
little
higher
than
they
are
in
norway
answered
the
doctor
laughing
they
prevent
one
from
seeing
the
stars
said
the
young
boy
because
we
are
in
the
quarter
where
the
nobility
live
said
kajsa
piqued
by
his
criticisms
when
you
pass
the
bridges
the
streets
are
broader
i
saw
that
as
we
rode
along
but
the
best
of
them
are
not
as
wide
as
that
which
borders
the
fiord
of
noroe
answered
erik
ah
ah
said
the
doctor
are
you
already
no
answered
erik
resolutely
i
am
too
much
obliged
to
you
dear
doctor
for
having
brought
me
but
you
asked
me
what
i
thought
of
stockholm
and
i
had
to
answer
noroe
must
be
a
frightful
little
hole
said
kajsa
a
frightful
little
hole
repeated
erik
indignantly
those
who
say
that
must
be
without
eyes
if
you
could
only
see
our
rocks
of
granite
our
mountains
our
glaciers
and
our
forests
of
pine
looking
so
black
against
the
pale
sky
and
besides
all
this
the
great
sea
sometimes
tumultuous
and
terrible
and
sometimes
so
calm
as
scarcely
to
rock
one
and
then
the
flight
of
the
which
are
lost
in
infinitude
and
then
return
to
fan
you
with
their
wings
oh
it
is
beautiful
yes
far
more
beautiful
than
a
town
i
was
not
speaking
of
the
country
but
of
the
houses
said
kajsa
they
are
only
peasants
cabins
are
they
not
uncle
in
these
peasants
cabins
your
father
and
grandfather
as
well
as
myself
were
born
my
child
answered
the
doctor
gravely
kajsa
blushed
and
remained
silent
they
are
only
wooden
houses
but
they
answer
as
well
as
any
said
erik
often
in
the
evening
while
my
father
mends
his
nets
and
my
mother
is
busy
with
her
we
three
sit
on
a
little
bench
otto
vanda
and
i
and
we
repeat
together
the
old
sagas
while
we
watch
the
shadows
that
play
upon
the
ceiling
and
when
the
wind
blows
outside
and
all
the
fishermen
are
safe
at
home
it
does
one
good
to
gather
around
the
blazing
fire
we
are
just
as
happy
as
if
we
were
in
a
beautiful
room
like
this
this
is
not
the
best
room
said
kajsa
proudly
i
must
show
you
the
grand
it
is
worth
seeing
but
there
are
so
many
books
in
this
one
said
erik
are
there
as
many
in
the
books
who
cares
for
them
there
are
velvet
armchairs
and
sofas
lace
curtains
a
splendid
french
clock
and
carpets
from
turkey
erik
did
not
appear
to
be
fascinated
by
this
description
but
cast
envious
glances
toward
the
large
oaken
bookcase
which
filled
one
side
of
the
parlor
you
can
go
and
examine
the
books
and
take
any
you
like
said
the
doctor
erik
did
not
wait
for
him
to
repeat
this
permission
he
chose
a
volume
at
once
and
seating
himself
in
a
corner
where
there
was
a
good
light
he
was
soon
completely
absorbed
in
his
reading
he
hardly
noticed
the
successive
entrance
of
two
old
gentlemen
who
were
intimate
friends
of
schwaryencrona
and
who
came
almost
every
evening
to
play
a
game
of
whist
with
him
the
first
who
arrived
was
professor
hochstedt
a
large
man
with
cold
and
stately
manners
who
expressed
in
polished
terms
the
pleasure
which
he
felt
at
the
doctor
safe
return
he
was
scarcely
seated
in
the
which
had
long
borne
the
name
of
the
professor
seat
when
a
sharp
ring
was
heard
it
is
bredejord
exclaimed
the
two
friends
simultaneously
the
door
soon
opened
to
admit
a
thin
sprightly
little
man
who
entered
like
a
gust
of
wind
seized
both
the
doctor
hands
kissed
kajsa
on
the
forehead
affectionately
greeted
the
professor
and
cast
a
glance
as
keen
as
that
of
a
mouse
around
the
room
it
was
the
advocate
bredejord
one
of
the
most
illustrious
lawyers
of
stockholm
ha
who
is
this
said
he
suddenly
as
he
beheld
erik
the
doctor
tried
to
explain
in
as
few
words
as
possible
what
a
young
fisherman
or
rather
a
boy
from
bergen
and
who
reads
gibbon
in
english
he
asked
for
he
saw
at
a
glance
what
the
book
was
which
so
absorbed
the
little
peasant
does
that
interest
you
my
boy
he
asked
yes
sir
it
is
a
work
that
i
have
wanted
to
read
for
a
long
time
the
first
volume
of
the
of
the
roman
empire
answered
erik
simply
upon
my
word
exclaimed
the
lawyer
it
appears
that
the
peasants
of
bergen
are
fond
of
serious
reading
but
are
you
from
bergen
he
asked
i
am
from
noroe
which
is
not
far
from
there
answered
erik
ah
have
they
usually
eyes
and
hair
as
brown
as
yours
at
noroe
no
sir
my
brother
and
sister
and
all
the
others
are
blondes
like
miss
kajsa
but
they
are
not
dressed
like
her
he
added
laughing
therefore
they
do
not
look
much
like
her
no
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
said
bredejord
miss
kajsa
is
a
product
of
civilization
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
at
stockholm
my
boy
if
i
am
not
too
curious
the
doctor
has
been
kind
enough
to
offer
to
send
me
to
school
said
erik
ah
ah
said
bredejord
tapping
his
with
the
ends
of
his
fingers
his
glance
seemed
to
question
the
doctor
about
this
living
problem
but
the
latter
made
a
sign
to
him
which
was
almost
imperceptible
not
to
pursue
his
investigations
and
he
changed
the
conversation
they
then
talked
about
court
affairs
the
city
news
and
all
that
had
taken
place
since
the
departure
of
the
doctor
then
dame
greta
came
and
opened
the
and
laid
out
the
cards
soon
silence
reigned
while
the
three
friends
were
absorbed
in
the
mysteries
of
whist
the
doctor
made
pretension
to
being
a
great
player
and
had
no
mercy
for
the
mistakes
of
his
partners
he
exulted
loudly
when
their
errors
caused
him
to
win
and
scolded
when
they
made
him
lose
after
every
rubber
he
took
pleasure
in
showing
the
delinquent
where
he
had
erred
what
card
he
should
have
led
and
which
he
should
have
held
back
it
is
generally
the
habit
of
but
it
is
not
always
conducive
to
amiability
particularly
when
the
victims
are
the
same
every
evening
happily
for
him
the
doctor
two
friends
never
lost
their
temper
the
professor
was
habitually
cool
and
the
lawyer
severely
skeptical
you
are
right
the
first
would
say
gravely
in
answer
to
the
most
severe
reproaches
my
dear
schwaryencrona
you
know
very
well
you
are
only
losing
your
time
lecturing
me
bredejord
would
say
laughing
all
my
life
i
have
made
the
greatest
blunders
whenever
i
play
whist
and
the
worst
of
it
is
i
do
not
improve
what
could
any
one
do
with
two
such
hardened
sinners
the
doctor
was
compelled
to
discontinue
his
criticisms
but
it
was
only
to
renew
them
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
for
he
was
incorrigible
it
happened
however
that
this
evening
he
lost
every
game
and
his
consequent
made
his
criticisms
very
severe
upon
his
two
companions
and
even
upon
the
dummy
but
the
professor
coolly
acknowledged
his
faults
and
the
lawyer
answered
his
most
bitter
reproaches
by
jokes
why
should
i
alter
my
play
when
i
win
by
playing
badly
and
you
lose
by
following
your
correct
rules
he
said
to
the
doctor
they
played
until
ten
then
kajsa
made
the
tea
in
a
magnificent
samovar
and
served
it
with
pretty
gracefulness
then
she
discreetly
disappeared
soon
dame
greta
appeared
and
calling
erik
she
conducted
him
to
the
apartment
which
had
been
prepared
for
him
it
was
a
pretty
little
room
clean
and
well
furnished
on
the
second
floor
the
three
friends
were
now
left
alone
now
at
last
you
can
tell
us
who
this
young
fisherman
from
noroe
is
who
reads
gibbon
in
the
original
text
said
bredejord
as
he
put
some
sugar
into
his
second
cup
of
tea
or
is
it
a
forbidden
subject
which
it
is
indiscreet
for
me
to
mention
there
is
nothing
mysterious
about
the
matter
and
i
will
willingly
tell
you
erik
history
for
i
know
that
i
can
rely
upon
your
discretion
answered
schwaryencrona
ah
i
knew
that
he
had
a
history
said
the
lawyer
seating
himself
comfortably
in
his
we
will
listen
dear
doctor
i
assure
you
that
your
confidence
will
not
be
misplaced
i
confess
this
youth
arouses
my
curiosity
like
a
problem
he
is
indeed
a
living
problem
answered
the
doctor
flattered
by
the
curiosity
of
his
friend
a
problem
which
i
hope
to
be
able
to
solve
but
i
must
tell
you
all
about
it
and
see
if
you
think
as
i
do
the
doctor
settled
himself
comfortably
and
began
by
telling
them
that
he
had
been
struck
by
erik
appearance
in
the
school
at
noroe
and
by
his
unusual
intelligence
he
had
made
inquiries
about
him
and
he
related
all
that
malarius
and
hersebom
had
told
he
omitted
none
of
the
details
he
spoke
of
the
buoy
of
the
name
of
cynthia
of
the
little
garments
which
dame
katrina
had
shown
him
of
the
coral
ornament
of
the
device
upon
it
and
of
the
character
of
the
letters
you
are
now
in
possession
of
all
the
facts
as
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
learn
them
he
said
and
you
must
bear
in
mind
that
the
extraordinary
ability
of
the
child
is
only
a
secondary
phenomenon
and
largely
due
to
the
interest
with
which
malarius
has
always
regarded
him
and
of
which
he
has
made
the
best
use
it
was
his
unusual
acquirements
which
first
drew
my
attention
to
him
and
led
me
to
make
inquiries
about
him
but
in
reality
this
has
little
connection
with
the
questions
which
now
occupy
me
which
are
where
did
this
child
come
from
and
what
course
would
it
be
best
for
me
to
take
in
order
to
discover
his
family
we
have
only
two
facts
to
guide
us
in
this
search
first
the
physical
indications
of
the
race
to
which
the
child
belongs
second
the
name
which
was
engraved
on
the
buoy
as
to
the
first
fact
there
can
be
no
doubt
the
child
belongs
to
the
celtic
race
he
presents
the
type
of
a
celt
in
all
its
beauty
and
purity
let
us
pass
to
the
second
fact
is
certainly
the
name
of
the
vessel
to
which
the
buoy
belonged
this
name
might
have
belonged
to
a
german
vessel
as
well
as
to
an
english
one
but
it
was
written
in
the
roman
characters
therefore
the
vessel
was
an
english
one
or
we
will
say
to
be
more
precise
besides
everything
confirms
the
hypothesis
for
more
than
one
english
vessel
going
and
coming
from
inverness
or
the
orkneys
have
been
driven
on
the
coast
of
norway
by
a
tempest
and
you
must
not
forget
that
the
little
living
waif
could
not
have
been
floating
for
a
long
while
since
he
had
resisted
hunger
and
all
the
dangers
of
his
perilous
journey
well
now
you
know
all
and
what
is
your
conclusion
my
dear
friends
neither
the
professor
nor
the
lawyer
thought
it
prudent
to
utter
a
word
you
have
not
been
able
to
arrive
at
any
conclusion
said
the
doctor
in
a
tone
which
betrayed
a
secret
triumph
perhaps
you
even
think
there
is
a
contradiction
between
the
two
facts
a
child
of
the
celtic
race
an
english
vessel
but
this
is
simply
because
you
have
failed
to
bear
in
mind
the
existence
on
the
coast
of
great
britain
of
a
people
of
the
celtic
race
on
her
sister
island
ireland
i
did
not
think
of
it
at
first
myself
and
it
prevented
me
from
solving
the
problem
but
when
it
occurred
to
me
i
said
to
myself
the
child
is
irish
is
this
your
opinion
hochstedt
if
there
was
anything
in
the
world
the
professor
disliked
it
was
to
give
a
positive
opinion
upon
any
subject
it
must
also
be
confessed
that
to
give
such
an
opinion
in
this
case
would
have
been
premature
he
therefore
contented
himself
with
nodding
his
head
and
saying
it
is
an
incontestable
fact
that
the
irish
belong
to
the
celtic
branch
of
the
arian
race
this
was
a
sufficiently
safe
aphorism
but
doctor
schwaryencrona
asked
nothing
more
and
only
saw
in
it
the
entire
confirmation
of
his
theory
you
think
so
yourself
he
said
eagerly
the
irish
were
celts
and
the
child
has
all
the
characteristics
of
the
race
the
having
been
an
english
vessel
it
appears
to
me
that
we
are
in
possession
of
the
necessary
links
in
order
to
find
the
family
of
the
poor
child
it
is
in
great
britain
that
we
must
look
for
them
some
advertisements
in
the
will
probably
be
sufficient
to
put
us
on
their
tracks
the
doctor
continued
to
enlarge
upon
his
plan
of
proceeding
when
he
remarked
the
obstinate
silence
of
the
lawyer
and
the
slightly
ironical
expression
with
which
he
listened
to
his
conclusions
if
you
are
not
of
my
opinion
bredejord
i
wish
you
would
say
so
you
know
that
i
do
not
fear
to
discuss
the
matter
he
said
stopping
short
i
have
nothing
to
say
answered
bredejord
hochstedt
can
bear
witness
that
i
have
said
nothing
no
but
i
see
very
well
that
you
do
not
share
my
opinion
and
i
am
curious
to
know
why
said
the
doctor
is
cynthia
an
english
name
he
asked
with
vehemence
yes
it
was
written
in
roman
characters
it
could
not
have
been
german
you
have
heard
our
eminent
friend
hochstedt
affirm
that
the
irish
are
celts
has
the
child
all
the
characteristics
of
the
celtic
race
you
can
judge
for
yourself
you
were
struck
by
his
appearance
before
i
opened
my
mouth
about
the
subject
i
conclude
therefore
that
it
is
a
want
of
friendship
for
you
to
refuse
to
agree
with
me
and
recognize
the
fact
that
the
boy
belongs
to
an
irish
family
want
of
friendship
is
a
strong
charge
answered
bredejord
if
you
apply
it
to
me
i
can
only
say
that
i
have
not
as
yet
expressed
the
slightest
opinion
no
but
i
see
that
you
do
not
spare
mine
have
i
not
a
right
but
give
some
facts
to
support
your
theory
i
have
not
said
that
i
have
formed
any
then
it
is
a
systematic
opposition
just
for
the
sake
of
contradicting
me
as
you
do
in
whist
nothing
is
further
from
my
thoughts
i
assure
you
your
reasoning
appeared
to
me
to
be
too
peremptory
that
is
all
in
what
way
if
you
please
i
am
curious
to
know
it
would
take
too
long
to
tell
you
eleven
is
striking
i
will
content
myself
with
offering
you
a
bet
your
copy
of
pliny
against
my
quintilian
that
you
have
not
judged
rightly
and
that
the
child
is
not
irish
you
know
that
i
do
not
like
to
bet
said
the
doctor
softened
by
his
unconquerable
good
humor
but
i
shall
take
so
much
pleasure
in
your
discomfiture
that
i
accept
your
offer
well
then
it
is
a
settled
affair
how
much
time
do
you
expect
to
take
for
your
researches
a
few
months
will
suffice
i
hope
but
i
have
said
two
years
to
hersebom
in
order
to
be
sure
that
no
efforts
were
wanting
ah
well
i
give
you
two
years
hochstedt
shall
be
our
witness
and
there
is
no
i
hope
assuredly
not
but
i
see
your
quintilian
in
great
danger
of
coming
to
keep
company
with
my
pliny
answered
the
doctor
then
after
shaking
hands
with
his
two
friends
he
accompanied
them
to
the
door
chapter
the
thirteen
days
of
christmas
the
next
day
erik
began
his
new
life
at
school
schwaryencrona
first
took
him
to
his
tailors
and
fitted
him
out
with
some
new
suits
of
clothes
then
he
introduced
him
to
the
principal
of
one
of
the
best
schools
in
town
it
was
called
in
swedish
hogre
elementar
larovek
in
this
school
were
taught
the
ancient
and
modern
languages
the
elementary
sciences
and
all
that
it
was
necessary
to
learn
before
entering
college
as
in
germany
and
italy
the
students
did
not
board
in
the
college
they
lived
with
their
families
in
the
town
with
the
professors
or
wherever
they
could
obtain
comfortable
accommodations
the
charges
are
very
moderate
in
fact
they
have
been
reduced
almost
to
nothing
large
gymnasiums
are
attached
to
each
of
the
higher
classes
and
physical
culture
is
as
carefully
attended
to
as
the
intellectual
erik
at
once
gained
the
head
of
his
division
he
learned
everything
with
such
extreme
facility
that
he
had
a
great
deal
of
time
to
himself
the
doctor
therefore
thought
that
it
would
be
better
for
him
to
utilize
his
evenings
by
taking
a
course
at
the
slodjskolan
the
great
industrial
school
of
stockholm
it
was
an
establishment
especially
devoted
to
the
practice
of
the
sciences
particularly
to
making
experiments
in
physics
and
chemistry
and
to
geometrical
constructions
which
are
only
taught
theoretically
in
the
schools
doctor
schwaryencrona
judged
rightly
that
the
teachings
of
this
school
which
was
one
of
the
wonders
of
stockholm
would
give
a
new
impetus
to
the
rapid
progress
which
erik
was
making
and
he
hoped
for
great
results
from
this
double
training
his
young
proved
worthy
of
the
advantages
which
he
procured
for
him
he
penetrated
the
depths
of
the
fundamental
sciences
and
instead
of
vague
and
superficial
ideas
the
ordinary
lot
of
so
many
pupils
he
stored
up
a
provision
of
just
precise
and
definite
facts
the
future
development
of
these
excellent
principles
could
only
be
a
question
of
time
hereafter
he
would
be
able
to
learn
without
difficulty
the
more
elevated
branches
of
these
studies
which
would
be
required
in
college
in
fact
it
would
be
only
play
to
him
the
same
service
which
malarius
had
rendered
him
in
teaching
him
languages
history
and
botany
the
slodjskolan
now
did
for
him
by
inculcating
the
a
b
c
of
the
industrial
arts
without
which
the
best
teaching
so
often
remains
a
dead
letter
far
from
fatiguing
erik
brain
the
multiplicity
and
variety
of
his
studies
strengthened
it
much
more
than
a
special
course
of
instruction
could
have
done
besides
the
gymnasium
was
always
open
to
him
to
recruit
his
body
when
his
studies
were
over
and
here
as
well
as
in
the
school
erik
stood
first
on
holidays
he
never
failed
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
sea
which
he
loved
with
filial
tenderness
he
talked
with
the
sailors
and
fishermen
and
often
brought
home
a
fine
fish
which
was
well
received
by
dame
greta
this
good
woman
had
conceived
a
great
affection
for
this
new
member
of
the
household
erik
was
so
gentle
and
naturally
so
courteous
and
obliging
so
studious
and
so
brave
that
it
was
impossible
to
know
him
and
not
to
like
him
in
eight
days
he
had
become
a
favorite
with
bredejord
and
hochstedt
as
he
was
already
with
doctor
schwaryencrona
the
only
person
who
treated
him
with
coldness
was
kajsa
whether
the
little
fairy
thought
that
her
hitherto
undisputed
sovereignty
in
the
house
was
in
danger
or
whether
she
bore
erik
a
grudge
because
of
the
sarcasms
which
her
aristocratic
air
toward
him
inspired
in
the
doctor
nobody
knew
however
she
persisted
in
treating
him
with
a
disdainful
coldness
which
no
courtesy
or
politeness
on
his
part
could
overcome
her
opportunities
of
displaying
her
disdain
were
fortunately
rare
for
erik
was
always
either
or
else
busy
in
his
own
little
room
time
passed
in
the
most
peaceful
manner
and
without
any
notable
incidents
we
will
pass
with
our
reader
without
further
comment
over
the
two
years
which
erik
spent
at
school
and
return
to
noroe
christmas
had
returned
for
the
second
time
since
erik
departure
it
is
in
all
central
and
northern
europe
the
great
annual
festival
because
it
is
coincident
with
the
dull
season
in
nearly
all
industries
in
norway
especially
they
prolong
the
festival
for
thirteen
tretten
yule
dage
the
thirteen
days
of
christmas
and
they
make
it
a
season
of
great
rejoicings
it
is
a
time
for
family
reunions
for
dinners
and
even
for
weddings
provisions
are
abundant
even
in
the
poorest
dwellings
everywhere
the
greatest
hospitality
is
the
order
of
the
day
the
yule
ol
or
christmas
beer
is
drunk
freely
every
visitor
is
offered
a
bumper
in
a
wooden
cup
mounted
in
gold
silver
or
copper
which
the
poorest
families
possess
and
which
cups
have
been
transmitted
to
them
from
time
immemorial
the
visitor
must
empty
this
cup
and
exchange
with
his
hosts
the
joyful
wishes
of
the
season
and
for
a
happy
new
year
it
is
also
at
christmas
that
the
servants
receive
their
new
clothes
which
are
often
the
best
part
of
their
wages
that
the
cows
and
sheep
and
even
the
birds
of
the
air
receive
a
double
ration
which
is
exceptionally
large
they
say
in
norway
of
a
poor
man
that
he
is
so
poor
that
he
can
not
even
give
the
sparrows
their
dinner
at
christmas
of
these
thirteen
traditional
days
is
the
gayest
it
is
the
custom
for
the
young
girls
and
boys
to
go
around
in
bands
on
their
or
and
stop
before
the
houses
and
sing
in
chorus
the
old
national
melodies
the
clear
voices
suddenly
sounding
through
the
fresh
night
air
in
the
lonely
valleys
with
their
wintery
surroundings
have
an
odd
and
charming
effect
the
doors
are
immediately
opened
the
singers
are
invited
to
enter
and
they
offer
them
cake
dried
apples
and
ale
and
often
make
them
dance
after
this
frugal
supper
the
joyous
band
depart
like
a
flock
of
gulls
to
perform
the
same
ceremony
further
away
distances
are
regarded
as
nothing
for
on
their
which
are
attached
to
their
feet
by
leather
straps
they
glide
over
several
miles
with
marvelous
rapidity
the
peasants
of
norway
also
use
with
these
a
strong
stick
to
balance
themselves
and
help
them
along
this
year
the
festival
would
be
a
joyous
one
for
the
herseboms
they
were
expecting
erik
a
letter
from
stockholm
had
announced
that
he
would
arrive
that
evening
therefore
otto
and
vanda
could
not
sit
still
every
moment
they
ran
to
the
door
to
see
if
he
was
coming
dame
katrina
although
she
reproved
them
for
their
impatience
felt
in
the
same
way
herself
hersebom
smoked
his
pipe
silently
and
was
divided
in
his
mind
between
a
longing
to
see
his
adopted
son
and
the
fear
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
keep
him
with
them
very
long
for
the
fiftieth
time
perhaps
otto
had
gone
to
the
door
when
he
gave
a
shout
and
cried
out
mother
vanda
i
believe
it
is
he
they
all
rushed
to
the
door
in
the
distance
on
the
road
which
led
from
bergen
they
saw
a
black
object
it
grew
larger
rapidly
and
soon
took
the
shape
of
a
young
man
clothed
in
gray
cloth
wearing
a
fur
cap
and
carrying
merrily
over
his
shoulders
a
knapsack
of
green
leather
he
had
on
and
would
soon
be
near
enough
to
recognize
the
traveler
perceived
those
who
were
watching
before
the
door
and
taking
off
his
cap
he
waved
it
around
his
head
two
minutes
later
erick
was
in
the
arms
of
katrina
otto
vanda
and
even
hersebom
who
had
left
his
and
advanced
to
the
door
they
hugged
him
and
almost
stifled
him
with
caresses
they
went
into
ecstasies
over
his
improved
appearance
dame
katrina
among
them
all
could
not
get
accustomed
to
it
what
is
this
the
dear
babe
that
i
nursed
on
my
knees
she
cried
this
great
boy
with
such
a
frank
and
resolute
air
with
these
strong
shoulders
this
elegant
form
and
on
whose
lip
i
can
already
see
signs
of
a
mustache
is
it
possible
the
brave
woman
was
conscious
of
feeling
a
sort
of
respect
for
her
former
nursling
she
was
proud
of
him
above
all
for
the
tears
of
joy
which
she
saw
in
his
eyes
for
he
also
was
deeply
affected
mother
is
it
really
you
he
exclaimed
i
can
hardly
believe
that
i
am
with
you
all
again
the
two
years
have
seemed
so
long
to
me
i
have
missed
you
all
as
i
know
you
have
missed
me
yes
said
hersebom
gravely
not
a
day
has
passed
without
our
having
spoken
of
you
morning
and
evening
and
at
meal
times
it
was
your
name
that
was
constantly
on
our
lips
but
you
my
boy
you
have
not
forgotten
us
in
the
grand
city
you
are
contented
to
return
and
see
the
old
country
and
the
old
house
i
am
sure
that
you
do
not
doubt
it
said
erik
as
he
embraced
them
all
you
were
always
in
my
thoughts
but
above
all
when
the
wind
blew
a
gale
i
thought
of
you
father
i
said
to
myself
where
is
he
has
he
returned
home
in
safety
and
in
the
evening
i
used
to
read
the
meteorological
bulletin
in
the
doctor
newspaper
to
see
what
kind
of
weather
you
had
had
on
the
coast
of
norway
if
it
was
the
same
as
on
the
coast
of
sweden
and
i
found
that
you
have
severe
storms
more
often
than
we
have
in
stockholm
which
come
from
america
and
beat
on
our
mountains
ah
how
often
i
have
wished
that
i
could
be
with
you
in
your
little
boat
to
help
you
with
the
sail
and
overcome
all
difficulties
and
on
the
other
hand
when
the
weather
was
fine
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
i
was
in
prison
in
that
great
city
between
the
tall
houses
yes
i
would
have
given
all
the
world
to
be
on
the
sea
for
one
hour
and
to
feel
as
formerly
free
and
joyfully
exhilarated
by
the
fresh
air
a
smile
brightened
the
face
of
the
fisherman
his
books
have
not
spoiled
him
he
said
a
joyful
season
and
a
happy
to
you
my
child
he
added
come
let
us
go
to
the
table
dinner
is
only
waiting
for
you
when
he
was
once
more
seated
in
his
old
place
on
the
right
hand
of
katrina
erik
was
able
to
look
around
him
and
mark
the
changes
that
two
years
had
made
in
the
family
otto
was
now
a
large
robust
boy
of
sixteen
years
of
age
and
who
looked
twenty
as
for
vanda
two
years
had
added
wonderfully
to
her
size
and
beauty
her
countenance
had
become
more
refined
her
magnificent
blonde
hair
which
lay
in
heavy
braids
upon
her
shoulders
formed
around
her
forehead
a
light
silvery
cloud
modest
and
sweet
as
usual
she
busied
herself
almost
unconsciously
with
seeing
that
no
one
wanted
for
anything
vanda
has
grown
to
be
a
great
girl
said
her
mother
proudly
and
if
you
knew
erik
how
learned
she
has
become
how
hard
she
has
worked
and
studied
since
you
left
us
she
is
the
best
scholar
in
the
school
now
and
malarius
says
she
is
his
only
consolation
for
no
longer
having
you
among
his
pupils
dear
malarius
how
glad
i
shall
be
to
see
him
again
said
erik
so
our
vanda
has
become
so
learned
has
she
he
replied
with
interest
while
the
young
girl
blushed
up
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
at
these
maternal
praises
she
has
learned
to
play
the
organ
also
and
malarius
says
that
she
has
the
sweetest
voice
of
all
the
choir
oh
decidedly
it
is
a
very
accomplished
young
person
whom
i
find
on
my
return
erik
said
laughing
to
relieve
the
embarrassment
of
his
sister
we
must
make
her
display
all
her
talents
and
without
affectation
he
began
to
talk
about
all
the
good
people
of
noroe
asking
questions
about
each
one
inquiring
for
his
old
and
about
all
that
had
happened
since
he
went
away
he
asked
about
their
fishing
adventures
and
all
the
details
of
their
daily
life
then
on
his
part
he
satisfied
the
curiosity
of
his
family
by
giving
an
account
of
his
mode
of
life
in
stockholm
he
told
them
about
dame
greta
about
kajsa
and
the
doctor
that
reminds
me
that
i
have
a
letter
for
you
father
he
said
drawing
it
out
of
the
inside
pocket
of
his
vest
i
do
not
know
what
it
contains
but
the
doctor
told
me
to
take
good
care
of
it
for
it
was
about
me
hersebom
took
the
letter
and
laid
it
on
the
table
by
his
side
well
said
erik
are
you
not
going
to
read
it
no
answered
the
fisherman
laconically
but
since
it
concerns
me
persisted
the
young
man
it
is
addressed
to
me
said
hersebom
holding
the
letter
before
his
eyes
yes
i
will
read
it
at
my
leisure
filial
obedience
is
the
basis
of
family
government
in
norway
erik
bowed
his
head
in
acquiescence
when
they
rose
from
the
table
the
three
children
seated
themselves
on
their
little
bench
in
the
as
they
had
so
often
done
before
and
began
one
of
those
confidential
conversations
where
each
one
relates
what
the
other
is
curious
to
know
and
where
they
tell
the
same
things
a
hundred
times
katrina
busied
herself
about
the
room
putting
everything
in
order
insisting
that
vanda
should
for
once
play
the
lady
as
she
said
and
not
trouble
herself
about
household
matters
as
for
hersebom
he
had
seated
himself
in
his
favorite
and
was
smoking
his
pipe
in
silence
it
was
only
after
he
had
finished
this
important
operation
that
he
decided
to
open
the
doctor
letter
he
read
it
through
without
saying
a
single
word
then
he
folded
it
up
put
it
in
his
pocket
and
smoked
a
second
pipe
like
the
first
without
uttering
a
sound
he
seemed
to
be
absorbed
in
his
own
reflections
although
he
was
never
a
talkative
man
his
silence
appeared
singular
to
dame
katrina
after
she
had
finished
her
work
she
went
and
seated
herself
beside
him
and
made
two
or
three
attempts
to
draw
him
into
conversation
but
she
only
received
the
most
brief
replies
being
thus
repulsed
she
became
melancholy
and
the
children
themselves
after
talking
breathlessly
for
some
time
began
to
be
affected
by
the
evident
sadness
of
their
parents
twenty
youthful
voices
singing
in
chorus
before
the
door
suddenly
greeted
their
ears
and
made
a
happy
diversion
it
was
a
merry
band
of
erik
old
classmates
who
had
conceived
the
pleasant
idea
of
coming
to
give
him
a
cordial
welcome
home
they
hastened
to
invite
them
into
the
house
and
offered
them
the
customary
feast
whilst
they
eagerly
pressed
around
their
old
friend
to
express
the
great
pleasure
which
they
felt
in
seeing
him
again
erik
was
touched
by
the
unexpected
visit
of
the
friends
of
his
childhood
and
was
anxious
to
go
with
them
on
their
christmas
journey
and
vanda
and
otto
also
were
naturally
eager
to
be
of
the
party
dame
katrina
charged
them
not
to
go
too
far
but
to
bring
their
brother
back
early
as
he
needed
rest
after
his
journey
the
door
was
hardly
closed
upon
them
when
she
resumed
her
seat
beside
her
husband
well
has
the
doctor
discovered
anything
she
asked
anxiously
instead
of
answering
hersebom
took
the
letter
from
his
pocket
and
read
it
aloud
but
not
without
hesitating
over
some
words
which
were
strange
to
him
my
dear
hersebom
wrote
the
doctor
it
is
now
two
years
since
you
intrusted
your
dear
child
to
my
care
and
every
day
i
have
had
renewed
pleasure
in
watching
his
progress
in
all
the
studies
that
he
has
undertaken
his
intelligence
is
as
remarkable
as
his
heart
is
generous
erik
is
truly
one
of
nature
nobleman
and
the
parents
who
have
lost
such
a
son
if
they
knew
the
extent
of
their
misfortune
would
be
objects
of
pity
but
it
is
very
doubtful
whether
his
parents
are
still
living
as
we
agreed
i
have
spared
no
efforts
to
discover
them
i
have
written
to
several
persons
in
england
who
have
an
agency
for
making
special
researches
i
have
had
advertisements
inserted
in
twenty
different
newspapers
english
irish
and
scotch
not
the
least
ray
of
light
has
been
thrown
upon
this
mystery
and
i
have
to
confess
that
all
the
information
which
i
have
succeeded
in
procuring
has
rather
tended
to
deepen
the
mystery
the
name
i
find
in
very
common
use
in
the
english
navy
from
lloyd
office
they
inform
me
that
there
are
seventeen
ships
of
different
tonnage
bearing
this
name
some
of
these
ships
belong
to
english
ports
and
some
to
scotland
and
ireland
my
supposition
concerning
the
nationality
of
the
child
is
therefore
confirmed
and
it
becomes
more
and
more
evident
to
me
that
erik
is
of
irish
parentage
i
do
not
know
whether
you
agree
with
me
on
this
point
but
i
have
already
mentioned
it
to
two
of
my
most
intimate
friends
in
stockholm
and
everything
seems
to
confirm
it
whether
this
irish
family
are
all
dead
or
whether
they
have
some
interest
in
remaining
unknown
i
have
not
been
able
to
discover
any
trace
of
them
another
singular
circumstance
and
which
i
also
think
looks
still
more
suspicious
is
the
fact
that
no
shipwreck
registered
at
lloyd
or
at
any
of
the
marine
insurance
companies
corresponds
with
the
date
of
the
infant
arrival
on
your
coast
two
vessels
named
have
been
lost
it
is
true
during
this
century
but
one
was
in
the
indian
ocean
years
ago
and
the
other
was
in
sight
of
portsmouth
eighteen
years
ago
we
are
therefore
obliged
to
conclude
that
the
infant
was
not
the
victim
of
a
shipwreck
doubtless
he
was
intentionally
exposed
to
the
mercy
of
the
waves
this
would
explain
why
all
my
inquiries
have
been
fruitless
be
this
as
it
may
after
having
questioned
successively
all
the
proprietors
of
the
vessels
bearing
the
name
of
without
obtaining
any
information
and
after
exhausting
all
known
means
of
pursuing
my
investigations
i
have
been
compelled
to
conclude
that
there
is
no
hope
of
discovering
erik
family
the
question
that
arises
for
us
to
decide
my
dear
hersebom
and
particularly
for
you
is
what
we
ought
to
say
to
the
boy
and
what
we
ought
to
do
for
him
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
should
now
tell
him
all
the
facts
about
himself
which
affect
him
so
nearly
and
leave
him
free
to
choose
his
own
path
in
life
you
know
we
agreed
to
adopt
this
course
if
my
efforts
should
prove
unsuccessful
the
time
has
come
for
you
to
keep
your
word
i
have
wished
to
leave
it
to
you
to
relate
all
this
to
erik
he
is
returning
to
noroe
still
ignorant
that
he
is
not
your
son
and
he
does
not
know
whether
he
is
to
return
to
stockholm
or
remain
with
you
it
is
for
you
to
tell
him
remember
if
you
refuse
to
fulfill
this
duty
erik
would
have
the
right
some
day
perhaps
to
be
astonished
at
you
recall
to
mind
also
that
he
is
a
boy
of
too
remarkable
abilities
to
be
condemned
to
an
obscure
and
illiterate
life
such
a
sentence
would
have
been
unmerited
two
years
ago
and
now
after
his
brilliant
career
at
stockholm
it
would
be
positively
unjustifiable
i
therefore
renew
my
offer
let
him
return
to
me
and
finish
his
studies
and
take
at
upsal
the
degree
of
doctor
of
medicine
i
will
continue
to
provide
for
him
as
if
he
were
my
own
son
and
he
has
only
to
go
on
and
win
honors
and
a
fortune
i
know
that
in
addressing
you
and
the
excellent
adopted
mother
of
erik
i
leave
his
future
in
good
hands
no
personal
consideration
i
am
sure
will
prevent
you
from
accepting
my
offer
take
malarius
advice
in
this
matter
while
awaiting
your
reply
hersebom
i
greet
you
affectionately
and
i
beg
you
to
remember
me
most
kindly
to
your
worthy
wife
and
children
schwaryencrona
when
the
fisherman
had
finished
reading
this
letter
dame
katrina
who
had
been
silently
weeping
while
she
listened
to
it
asked
him
what
he
intended
to
do
my
duty
is
very
clear
he
said
i
shall
tell
the
boy
everything
that
is
my
opinion
also
it
must
be
done
or
we
should
never
have
another
peaceful
moment
she
murmured
as
she
dried
her
eyes
then
they
both
relapsed
into
silence
it
was
past
midnight
when
the
three
children
returned
from
their
expedition
their
cheeks
were
rosy
and
their
eyes
shone
with
pleasure
from
their
walk
in
the
fresh
air
they
seated
themselves
around
the
fire
to
finish
gayly
their
by
eating
a
last
cake
before
the
enormous
log
which
looked
like
a
burning
cavern
chapter
vi
erik
decision
the
next
day
the
fisherman
called
erik
to
him
and
in
the
presence
of
katrina
otto
and
vanda
spoke
to
him
as
follows
erik
the
letter
of
doctor
schwaryencrona
was
about
you
he
writes
that
you
have
given
entire
satisfaction
to
your
teachers
and
the
doctor
offers
to
pay
all
the
expenses
of
your
education
if
you
wish
to
continue
your
studies
but
this
letter
also
requires
you
to
decide
for
yourself
whether
you
will
accept
this
offer
or
remain
with
us
at
noroe
which
we
would
like
so
much
to
have
you
do
as
you
no
doubt
know
but
before
you
make
up
your
mind
i
must
tell
you
a
great
secret
a
secret
that
my
wife
and
i
would
have
preferred
to
keep
to
ourselves
at
this
moment
dame
katrina
could
not
restrain
her
tears
and
sobbing
she
took
the
hand
of
erik
and
pressed
it
to
her
heart
as
if
protesting
against
the
information
which
the
young
man
was
now
to
hear
this
secret
continued
hersebom
in
a
strangely
altered
voice
is
that
you
are
our
son
only
by
adoption
i
found
you
on
the
sea
my
child
and
brought
you
home
when
you
were
only
eight
or
nine
months
old
god
is
my
witness
that
we
never
intended
to
tell
you
this
and
neither
my
wife
nor
myself
have
ever
made
the
least
difference
between
you
and
otto
and
vanda
but
doctor
schwaryencrona
requires
us
to
do
so
therefore
i
wish
you
to
read
what
he
has
written
to
me
erik
had
suddenly
become
deadly
pale
otto
and
vanda
surprised
at
what
they
had
heard
both
uttered
a
cry
of
astonishment
then
they
put
their
arms
around
erik
and
clung
closely
to
him
one
on
the
right
and
the
other
on
the
left
then
erik
took
the
doctor
letter
and
without
trying
to
conceal
his
emotion
he
read
what
he
had
written
to
hersebom
the
fisherman
then
told
him
all
the
facts
about
himself
he
explained
how
schwaryencrona
had
undertaken
to
try
and
discover
the
family
to
which
he
belonged
and
also
that
he
had
been
unsuccessful
how
that
but
for
his
advice
and
suggestions
they
would
never
have
thought
of
doing
so
then
dame
katrina
arose
and
going
to
the
oaken
chest
brought
out
the
garments
that
the
baby
had
worn
and
showed
him
also
the
coral
which
had
been
fastened
around
his
neck
the
story
was
naturally
so
full
of
dramatic
interest
to
the
children
that
they
forgot
for
a
time
at
least
how
sad
it
was
they
looked
with
wonder
at
the
lace
and
velvet
the
golden
setting
of
the
coral
and
the
inscription
it
almost
seemed
to
them
as
if
they
were
taking
part
in
some
fairy
tale
the
impossibility
of
obtaining
any
information
as
reported
by
the
doctor
only
made
them
regard
these
articles
as
almost
sacred
erik
looked
at
them
as
if
he
were
in
a
dream
and
his
thoughts
flew
to
the
unknown
mother
who
without
doubt
had
herself
dressed
him
in
these
little
garments
and
more
than
once
shook
the
coral
before
the
eyes
of
the
baby
to
make
him
smile
it
seemed
to
him
when
he
touched
them
as
if
he
held
direct
communion
with
her
through
time
and
space
but
where
was
this
mother
was
she
still
living
or
had
she
perished
was
she
weeping
for
her
lost
son
or
must
the
son
on
the
contrary
think
of
her
as
forever
lost
to
him
he
remained
for
some
minutes
absorbed
in
these
reflections
with
his
head
bent
but
a
word
from
dame
katrina
recalled
him
to
himself
erik
you
are
always
our
child
she
cried
disturbed
by
his
silence
the
eyes
of
the
young
man
as
he
looked
around
him
fell
on
all
their
loving
countenances
the
maternal
look
of
the
loving
wife
the
honest
face
of
hersebom
that
of
otto
even
more
affectionate
than
usual
and
that
of
vanda
serious
and
troubled
as
he
read
the
tenderness
and
disquietude
displayed
on
all
their
faces
erik
felt
as
if
his
heart
was
melting
within
him
in
a
moment
he
realized
his
situation
and
saw
vividly
the
scene
which
his
father
had
described
the
cradle
abandoned
to
the
mercy
of
the
waves
rescued
by
the
hardy
fisherman
and
carried
to
his
wife
and
these
people
humble
and
poor
as
they
were
had
not
hesitated
to
take
care
of
the
little
stranger
to
adopt
and
cherish
him
as
their
own
son
they
had
not
spoken
of
the
matter
for
fourteen
years
and
now
they
were
hanging
on
his
words
as
if
they
were
a
matter
of
life
and
death
to
them
all
this
touched
him
so
deeply
that
suddenly
his
tears
came
an
irresistible
feeling
of
love
and
gratitude
overwhelmed
him
he
felt
eager
on
his
part
to
repay
by
some
devotion
the
tenderness
which
they
had
shown
to
him
he
resolved
to
stay
with
them
at
noroe
forever
and
content
himself
with
their
humble
lot
while
he
endeavored
to
do
everything
in
his
power
to
repay
them
mother
said
he
throwing
himself
into
katrina
arms
do
you
think
that
i
can
hesitate
now
that
i
know
all
we
will
write
to
the
doctor
and
thank
him
for
his
kind
offer
and
tell
him
that
i
have
chosen
to
remain
with
you
i
will
be
a
fisherman
like
you
father
and
like
otto
since
you
have
given
me
a
place
at
your
fireside
i
would
prefer
to
retain
it
since
you
have
nourished
me
by
the
labor
of
your
hands
i
ask
to
be
allowed
to
repay
you
in
your
old
age
for
your
generosity
toward
me
when
i
was
a
helpless
infant
god
be
praised
cried
dame
katrina
pressing
erik
to
her
heart
in
a
transport
of
joy
and
tenderness
i
knew
that
the
child
would
prefer
the
sea
to
all
their
books
said
hersebom
not
understanding
the
sacrifice
that
erik
decision
would
be
to
him
come
the
matter
is
settled
we
will
not
talk
about
it
any
more
but
only
try
to
enjoy
this
good
festival
of
christmas
they
all
embraced
each
other
with
eyes
humid
with
happiness
and
vowed
they
would
never
be
separated
when
erik
was
alone
he
could
not
help
a
stifled
sigh
as
he
thought
about
all
his
former
dreams
of
work
and
of
the
career
which
he
had
renounced
but
still
he
experienced
at
the
same
time
a
joy
which
he
believed
would
repay
him
for
the
sacrifice
since
it
is
the
wish
of
my
adopted
parents
he
said
to
himself
the
rest
does
not
signify
i
ought
to
be
willing
to
work
for
them
in
the
sphere
and
condition
where
their
devotion
has
placed
me
if
i
have
sometimes
felt
ambitious
to
take
a
higher
position
in
the
world
was
it
not
that
i
might
be
able
to
assist
them
since
it
makes
them
happy
to
have
me
with
them
and
as
they
desire
nothing
better
than
their
present
life
i
must
try
to
be
contented
and
endeavor
by
good
conduct
and
hard
work
to
give
them
satisfaction
adieu
then
to
my
books
thus
he
mused
and
soon
his
thoughts
returned
to
the
time
when
the
fisherman
had
found
him
floating
in
his
little
cradle
on
the
waves
what
country
did
he
belong
to
who
were
his
parents
were
they
still
alive
had
he
in
some
foreign
country
brothers
and
sisters
whom
he
would
never
know
christmas
had
also
been
in
schwaryencrona
house
in
stockholm
a
season
of
great
festivity
it
was
at
this
time
as
the
reader
doubtless
remembers
that
they
had
agreed
to
decide
the
bet
between
him
and
bredejord
and
that
professor
hochstedt
was
to
be
the
umpire
for
two
years
not
a
word
had
been
said
by
either
of
them
about
this
bet
the
doctor
had
been
patiently
pursuing
his
researches
in
england
writing
to
the
maritime
agencies
and
multiplying
his
advertisements
in
the
newspapers
but
he
had
taken
care
not
to
confess
that
his
efforts
had
been
fruitless
as
for
bredejord
he
had
had
the
good
taste
to
avoid
all
allusion
to
the
subject
and
contented
himself
with
occasionally
admiring
the
beautiful
binding
of
the
pliny
which
was
displayed
in
the
but
when
he
struck
his
sharply
with
the
ends
of
his
fingers
while
he
looked
at
the
book
the
doctor
correctly
interpreted
the
pantomime
which
was
a
shock
to
his
nerves
and
said
to
himself
oh
yes
he
is
thinking
how
well
the
pliny
will
look
beside
his
elegant
editions
of
quintilian
and
horace
on
these
evenings
he
was
more
merciless
than
ever
if
his
unfortunate
partner
made
any
mistakes
at
whist
but
time
had
taken
its
flight
and
he
was
now
obliged
to
submit
the
question
to
the
impartial
arbitration
of
professor
hochstedt
schwaryencrona
approached
the
subject
frankly
kajsa
had
hardly
left
him
alone
with
his
two
friends
when
he
confessed
to
them
as
he
had
confessed
in
his
letter
to
hersebom
that
his
investigations
had
been
without
result
nothing
had
occurred
to
throw
any
light
on
the
mystery
which
surrounded
erik
origin
and
the
doctor
in
all
sincerity
declared
that
the
problem
was
thought
by
him
to
be
insolvable
but
he
continued
i
should
be
doing
myself
an
injustice
if
i
did
not
declare
with
equal
sincerity
that
i
do
not
believe
that
i
have
lost
my
bet
i
have
not
discovered
erik
family
it
is
true
but
all
the
information
that
i
have
been
able
to
obtain
corroborates
the
conclusion
which
i
had
arrived
at
the
was
no
doubt
an
english
vessel
for
there
are
at
least
seventeen
ships
bearing
this
name
registered
at
lloyd
as
for
ethnographical
characteristics
they
are
clearly
celtic
my
hypothesis
therefore
as
to
the
nationality
of
erik
is
victoriously
confirmed
i
am
more
than
ever
certain
that
he
is
of
irish
extraction
as
i
at
first
surmised
but
i
can
not
compel
his
family
to
come
forward
and
acknowledge
him
if
they
have
any
reasons
of
their
own
for
wishing
him
to
continue
lost
to
them
this
is
all
i
have
to
say
my
dear
hochstedt
and
now
you
must
be
the
judge
as
to
whether
the
quintilian
of
our
friend
bredejord
should
not
legitimately
be
transferred
to
my
at
these
words
which
seemed
to
occasion
a
strong
inclination
to
laugh
the
lawyer
fell
back
in
his
raised
his
hands
as
if
in
protestation
then
he
fixed
his
brilliant
eyes
upon
professor
hochstedt
to
see
how
he
would
regard
the
matter
the
professor
did
not
betray
the
embarrassment
which
might
have
been
expected
he
would
have
certainly
felt
miserable
if
the
doctor
had
urged
any
incontrovertible
argument
which
would
have
compelled
him
to
decide
in
favor
of
one
or
the
other
his
prudent
character
led
him
to
speak
in
indefinite
terms
he
excelled
in
presenting
one
after
the
other
both
sides
of
a
question
and
he
reveled
in
his
vagaries
like
a
fish
in
water
therefore
this
evening
he
felt
quite
equal
to
the
situation
the
fact
is
incontestable
he
said
shaking
his
head
that
there
are
seventeen
english
vessels
bearing
the
name
of
and
this
seems
to
favor
the
conclusion
arrived
at
by
our
eminent
friend
the
characteristic
traits
also
have
assuredly
great
weight
and
i
do
not
hesitate
to
say
that
they
appear
to
me
to
be
quite
conclusive
i
do
not
hesitate
to
confess
that
if
i
were
called
upon
to
give
an
opinion
as
to
erik
nationality
i
should
say
that
he
was
irish
but
to
decide
the
bet
in
question
we
require
something
more
than
probabilities
we
must
have
facts
to
guide
us
the
chances
so
far
greatly
favor
the
opinion
of
schwaryencrona
but
bredejord
can
allege
that
nothing
has
actually
been
proved
i
see
therefore
no
sufficient
reason
for
declaring
that
the
quintilian
has
been
won
by
the
doctor
neither
can
i
say
that
the
professor
has
lost
his
pliny
in
my
opinion
as
the
question
remains
undecided
it
ought
to
be
annulled
which
is
the
best
thing
to
do
in
such
a
case
the
doctor
face
clearly
betrayed
his
dissatisfaction
as
for
bredejord
he
leaped
to
his
feet
saying
your
argument
is
a
beautiful
one
my
dear
hochstedt
but
i
think
you
are
hasty
in
your
conclusions
schwaryencrona
you
say
has
not
verified
his
opinions
sufficiently
for
you
to
say
positively
that
he
has
won
the
bet
although
you
think
that
all
the
probabilities
are
in
his
favor
what
will
you
say
then
if
i
prove
to
you
immediately
that
the
was
not
an
english
vessel
at
all
what
would
i
say
said
the
professor
somewhat
troubled
by
this
sudden
attack
upon
my
word
i
do
not
know
i
would
have
to
consider
the
question
in
a
different
aspect
examine
it
then
at
your
leisure
answered
the
advocate
thrusting
his
hand
into
the
inner
pocket
of
his
coat
and
taking
out
a
case
from
which
he
selected
a
letter
inclosed
in
one
of
those
yellow
envelopes
which
betray
at
the
first
glance
their
american
origin
this
is
a
document
which
you
can
not
controvert
he
added
placing
the
letter
before
the
doctor
eyes
who
read
aloud
bredejord
new
york
october
sir
in
reply
to
your
letter
of
the
instant
i
hasten
to
write
you
the
following
facts
a
vessel
named
commanded
by
captain
barton
and
the
property
of
the
canadian
general
transportation
company
was
lost
with
her
cargo
and
all
on
board
just
fourteen
years
ago
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
faroe
islands
this
vessel
was
insured
in
the
general
steam
navigation
company
of
new
york
for
the
sum
of
eight
hundred
thousand
dollars
the
disappearance
of
the
having
remained
unexplained
and
the
causes
of
the
sad
accident
never
having
been
clearly
proved
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
insurance
company
a
lawsuit
ensued
which
was
lost
by
the
proprietors
of
the
said
vessel
the
loss
of
this
lawsuit
occasioned
the
dissolution
of
the
canadian
general
transportation
company
which
has
ceased
to
exist
for
the
last
eleven
years
having
gone
into
liquidation
while
waiting
to
hear
from
you
again
i
beg
of
you
sir
to
accept
our
sincere
salutations
jeremiah
smith
walker
maritime
agents
well
what
do
you
say
to
that
asked
bredejord
when
the
doctor
had
finished
reading
the
letter
it
is
a
document
of
some
value
i
think
do
you
agree
with
me
i
quite
agree
with
you
answered
the
doctor
how
did
you
procure
it
in
the
simplest
way
in
the
world
that
evening
when
you
spoke
to
me
about
the
being
necessarily
an
english
vessel
i
thought
that
you
were
taking
too
limited
a
field
for
your
researches
and
that
the
vessel
might
be
an
american
one
when
time
passed
and
you
received
no
intelligence
for
you
would
have
told
us
if
you
had
the
idea
occurred
to
me
of
writing
to
new
york
the
third
letter
brought
the
result
which
you
have
before
you
the
affair
is
no
longer
a
complicated
one
do
you
not
think
that
it
assures
to
me
beyond
contest
the
possession
of
your
pliny
it
appears
to
me
to
be
rather
a
forced
conclusion
replied
the
doctor
taking
the
letter
and
reading
it
over
again
to
see
if
he
could
find
any
new
arguments
to
support
his
theory
how
forced
cried
the
advocate
i
have
proved
to
you
that
the
vessel
was
an
american
one
and
that
she
was
lost
off
the
faroe
islands
that
is
to
say
near
the
coast
of
norway
precisely
at
the
time
which
corresponds
to
the
arrival
of
the
infant
and
still
you
are
not
convinced
of
your
error
not
in
the
least
my
dear
friend
i
do
not
dispute
the
value
or
your
document
you
have
discovered
what
i
have
found
it
impossible
to
do
the
true
which
was
lost
at
a
little
distance
from
our
coast
and
at
a
specified
epoch
but
permit
me
to
say
that
this
only
confirms
precisely
my
theory
for
the
vessel
was
a
canadian
one
or
in
other
words
english
and
the
irish
element
is
very
strong
in
some
parts
of
canada
and
i
have
therefore
more
reason
than
ever
for
being
sure
that
the
child
is
of
irish
origin
ah
is
that
what
you
find
in
my
letter
said
bredejord
more
vexed
than
he
was
willing
to
appear
to
be
then
without
doubt
you
persist
in
believing
that
you
have
not
lost
your
pliny
assuredly
perhaps
you
think
you
have
a
right
to
my
quintilian
i
hope
in
any
case
to
be
able
to
prove
my
right
thanks
to
your
discovery
if
you
will
only
give
me
time
by
renewing
the
bet
i
am
willing
i
ask
nothing
better
how
much
time
do
you
want
let
us
take
two
more
years
and
wait
until
the
second
christmas
after
this
one
it
is
agreed
answered
bredejord
but
be
assured
doctor
that
you
will
finally
see
me
in
possession
of
your
pliny
by
my
faith
no
it
will
make
a
fine
appearance
in
my
beside
your
quintilian
chapter
vii
vanda
opinion
in
the
beginning
erik
burning
with
zeal
at
the
sacrifice
which
he
had
made
devoted
all
his
energies
to
a
fisherman
life
and
tried
to
forget
that
he
had
ever
known
any
other
he
was
always
the
first
to
rise
and
prepare
the
boat
for
his
adopted
father
who
found
every
morning
all
the
arrangements
completed
and
he
had
only
to
step
on
board
if
the
wind
failed
then
erik
took
the
heavy
oars
and
rowed
with
all
his
strength
seeming
to
choose
the
hardest
and
most
fatiguing
duties
nothing
discouraged
him
neither
the
long
waiting
for
the
fish
to
seize
the
bait
nor
the
various
preparations
to
which
the
captive
was
subjected
first
the
removal
of
the
tongue
which
is
a
most
delicate
morsel
then
the
head
then
the
bones
before
placing
them
in
the
reservoir
where
they
receive
their
first
salting
whatever
their
work
was
erik
did
his
part
not
only
conscientiously
but
eagerly
he
astonished
the
placid
otto
by
his
extreme
application
to
the
smallest
details
of
their
business
how
you
must
have
suffered
when
you
were
shut
up
in
the
town
said
the
lad
to
him
naively
you
only
seem
to
be
in
your
element
when
you
are
on
the
borders
of
the
fiord
or
on
the
open
sea
when
their
conversation
took
this
turn
erik
always
remained
silent
sometimes
however
he
would
revert
to
the
subject
himself
and
try
to
prove
to
otto
or
rather
to
himself
that
there
was
no
better
state
of
existence
than
their
own
it
is
what
i
have
always
heard
the
other
would
answer
with
his
calm
smile
and
poor
erik
would
turn
away
and
stifle
a
sigh
the
truth
is
that
he
suffered
cruelly
after
renouncing
his
studies
and
seeing
himself
condemned
to
a
life
of
manual
labor
when
these
thoughts
came
to
him
he
fought
against
them
with
all
his
might
he
did
not
wish
any
one
to
suspect
that
he
felt
in
this
way
and
in
hiding
them
within
his
own
breast
he
suffered
all
the
more
a
catastrophe
which
occurred
at
the
beginning
of
the
spring
only
served
to
increase
his
discouragement
one
day
as
there
was
a
great
deal
of
work
to
do
at
home
in
piling
together
the
salted
fish
hersebom
had
intrusted
it
to
erik
and
to
otto
and
had
gone
out
to
fish
alone
the
weather
was
stormy
and
the
sky
very
cloudy
for
the
time
of
the
year
the
two
young
men
although
they
worked
actively
could
not
help
noticing
that
it
was
exceptionally
dull
and
they
felt
the
atmosphere
very
heavy
it
is
singular
said
erik
but
i
feel
a
roaring
in
my
ears
as
if
i
were
some
distance
above
the
earth
in
a
balloon
almost
immediately
his
nose
began
to
bleed
otto
had
a
similar
sensation
although
not
quite
so
severe
i
think
the
barometer
must
be
very
low
said
erik
if
i
had
time
i
would
run
to
malarius
and
see
you
have
plenty
of
time
said
otto
our
work
is
nearly
done
and
even
if
you
were
delayed
i
could
easily
finish
it
alone
then
i
will
go
replied
erik
i
do
not
know
why
the
state
of
the
atmosphere
should
trouble
me
so
much
i
wish
father
was
home
as
he
walked
toward
the
school
he
met
malarius
on
the
road
is
it
you
erik
said
the
teacher
i
am
glad
to
see
you
and
make
sure
that
you
are
not
on
the
sea
i
was
just
going
to
inquire
the
barometer
has
fallen
with
such
rapidity
during
the
last
half
hour
i
have
never
seen
anything
like
it
we
are
surely
going
to
have
a
change
of
weather
malarius
had
hardly
finished
speaking
when
a
distant
grumbling
followed
by
a
lugubrious
roaring
fell
upon
their
ears
the
sky
became
covered
with
a
cloud
as
black
as
ink
which
spread
rapidly
in
all
directions
and
obscured
every
object
with
great
swiftness
then
suddenly
after
an
interval
of
complete
silence
the
leaves
of
the
trees
the
bits
of
straw
the
sand
and
even
the
stones
were
swept
away
by
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
the
hurricane
had
begun
it
raged
with
violence
the
chimneys
the
window
shutters
and
in
some
places
even
the
roofs
of
the
houses
were
blown
down
and
the
without
exception
were
carried
away
and
destroyed
by
the
wind
in
the
fiord
which
was
usually
as
calm
as
a
well
in
a
the
most
terrible
tempest
raged
the
waves
were
enormous
and
came
and
went
breaking
against
the
shore
with
a
deafening
noise
the
cyclone
raged
for
an
hour
then
arrested
in
its
course
by
the
heights
of
norway
it
moved
toward
the
south
and
swept
over
continental
europe
it
is
noted
in
meteorological
annals
as
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
and
disastrous
that
ever
was
known
upon
the
atlantic
coast
these
great
changes
of
the
atmosphere
are
now
generally
announced
beforehand
by
the
telegraph
most
of
the
european
forewarned
of
the
danger
have
time
to
warn
vessels
and
seamen
of
the
threatened
tempest
and
they
seek
a
safe
anchorage
by
this
means
many
disasters
are
averted
but
on
the
distant
and
less
frequented
coasts
in
the
the
number
of
shipwrecks
was
beyond
computation
in
one
office
that
of
veritas
in
france
there
were
registered
not
less
than
the
first
thought
of
all
the
members
of
the
hersebom
family
as
well
as
of
all
the
other
families
of
fishermen
was
naturally
for
those
who
were
on
the
sea
on
this
disastrous
day
hersebom
went
most
often
to
the
western
coast
of
a
large
island
which
was
about
two
miles
distant
beyond
the
entrance
to
the
fiord
it
was
the
spot
where
he
had
first
seen
erik
they
hoped
that
during
the
tempest
he
had
been
able
to
find
shelter
by
running
his
boat
upon
the
low
and
sandy
shore
but
erik
and
otto
felt
so
anxious
that
they
could
not
wait
until
evening
to
see
if
this
hope
was
well
founded
the
fiord
had
hardly
resumed
its
ordinary
placidity
after
the
passage
of
the
hurricane
when
they
borrowed
a
boat
of
one
of
their
neighbors
in
order
to
go
in
search
of
him
malarius
insisted
upon
accompanying
the
young
men
upon
their
expedition
and
they
all
three
set
out
anxiously
watched
by
katrina
and
her
daughter
on
the
fiord
the
wind
had
nearly
gone
down
but
it
blew
from
the
west
and
to
reach
the
entrance
to
the
harbor
they
were
obliged
to
use
their
oars
this
took
them
more
than
an
hour
when
they
reached
the
entrance
an
unexpected
obstacle
presented
itself
the
tempest
was
still
raging
on
the
ocean
and
the
waves
dashed
against
the
island
which
formed
the
entrance
to
the
fiord
of
noroe
forming
two
currents
which
came
and
went
with
such
violence
in
the
narrow
pass
that
it
was
impossible
to
gain
the
open
sea
a
steamboat
could
not
have
ventured
through
it
and
a
weak
boat
could
not
have
resisted
it
for
a
moment
the
only
thing
they
could
do
therefore
was
to
return
to
noroe
and
wait
as
patiently
as
they
could
the
hour
when
he
habitually
came
home
passed
without
bringing
hersebom
but
none
of
the
other
fishermen
returned
so
they
hoped
that
they
were
all
detained
by
the
impassable
state
of
the
entrance
to
the
fiord
and
would
not
believe
that
he
had
personally
met
with
any
disaster
that
evening
was
a
very
sad
one
at
all
the
firesides
where
a
member
was
missing
as
the
night
passed
without
any
of
the
absent
men
making
their
appearance
the
anxieties
of
their
families
increased
in
hersebom
house
nobody
went
to
bed
they
passed
the
long
hours
of
waiting
seated
in
a
circle
around
the
fire
silent
and
anxious
dawn
is
late
in
these
high
latitudes
in
march
but
when
at
last
it
grew
light
it
was
bright
and
clear
the
wind
was
calm
and
they
hoped
they
would
be
able
to
get
through
the
pass
a
regular
fleet
of
boats
composed
of
every
one
who
could
get
away
from
noroe
was
ready
to
go
in
search
of
the
absent
men
just
at
this
moment
several
vessels
hove
in
sight
and
soon
reached
the
village
they
were
the
fishermen
who
had
gone
out
the
day
before
not
expecting
such
a
cyclone
but
hersebom
was
not
among
them
nobody
could
give
any
account
of
him
and
the
fact
of
his
not
returning
with
the
others
increased
their
anxiety
as
all
the
men
had
been
in
great
peril
some
had
been
surprised
by
the
cyclone
and
dashed
upon
the
shore
others
had
time
to
shelter
themselves
in
a
secure
place
of
anchorage
a
few
had
reached
the
land
just
in
time
to
save
themselves
it
was
decided
that
the
flotilla
should
go
in
search
of
those
who
were
missing
malarius
who
still
wished
to
take
part
in
the
expedition
accompanied
erik
and
otto
a
large
yellow
dog
begged
so
earnestly
to
go
with
them
that
at
length
they
yielded
it
was
kaas
the
greenland
dog
that
hersebom
had
brought
back
with
him
after
a
voyage
to
cape
farewell
after
issuing
from
the
pass
the
boats
separated
some
going
to
the
right
and
others
to
the
left
to
explore
the
shores
of
the
innumerable
islands
which
lie
scattered
near
the
entrance
to
the
fiord
of
noroe
as
well
as
all
along
the
coast
of
norway
when
they
met
at
midday
at
a
given
point
which
had
been
agreed
upon
before
separating
no
trace
of
hersebom
had
been
discovered
as
the
search
had
apparently
been
well
conducted
everyone
was
of
the
opinion
that
they
had
nothing
more
to
do
but
to
go
home
but
erik
was
not
willing
to
own
himself
defeated
and
give
up
all
hope
so
easily
he
declared
that
having
visited
all
the
islands
which
lay
toward
the
south
he
now
wished
to
explore
those
which
were
in
the
north
malarius
and
otto
supported
him
and
seeing
this
they
granted
his
desire
this
persistence
deserved
some
recompense
toward
two
as
they
approached
a
large
island
kaas
began
suddenly
to
bark
furiously
then
before
they
could
prevent
him
he
threw
himself
into
the
water
and
swam
to
the
shore
erik
and
otto
rowed
with
all
their
strength
in
the
same
direction
soon
they
saw
the
dog
reach
the
island
and
bound
while
he
uttered
loud
howls
toward
what
appeared
to
be
a
human
form
lying
extended
upon
the
sand
they
made
all
possible
haste
and
soon
saw
beyond
a
doubt
that
it
was
a
man
who
was
lying
there
and
this
man
was
hersebom
bloody
pale
cold
inanimate
dead
perhaps
kaas
was
licking
his
hands
and
uttering
mournful
cries
erik
first
action
was
to
drop
on
his
knees
beside
the
cold
body
and
apply
his
ear
to
his
heart
he
is
alive
i
feel
it
beat
he
cried
malarias
had
taken
one
of
hersebom
hand
and
was
feeling
his
pulse
and
he
shook
his
head
sadly
and
doubtfully
but
he
would
not
neglect
any
of
the
means
which
are
usually
tried
in
such
cases
after
taking
off
a
large
woolen
girdle
which
he
wore
around
his
waist
he
tore
it
in
three
pieces
and
giving
one
to
each
of
the
young
men
they
rubbed
vigorously
the
body
the
arms
and
the
legs
of
the
fisherman
it
was
soon
manifest
that
this
simple
treatment
had
produced
the
effect
of
restoring
the
circulation
the
beating
of
the
heart
grew
stronger
the
chest
rose
and
a
feeble
respiration
escaped
through
the
lips
in
a
little
while
hersebom
was
partially
restored
to
consciousness
for
he
distinctly
moaned
malarias
and
the
two
young
men
lifted
him
from
the
ground
and
carried
him
to
the
boat
where
they
hastily
arranged
a
bed
for
him
of
sails
as
they
laid
him
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
he
opened
his
eyes
a
drink
he
said
in
a
weak
voice
erik
held
a
flask
of
brandy
to
his
lips
he
swallowed
a
mouthful
and
appeared
to
be
conscious
of
their
arrival
for
he
tried
to
give
them
an
affectionate
and
grateful
smile
but
fatigue
overcame
him
almost
immediately
and
he
fell
into
a
heavy
sleep
which
resembled
a
complete
lethargy
thinking
justly
that
the
best
thing
they
could
do
was
to
get
him
home
as
speedily
as
possible
they
took
their
oars
and
rowed
vigorously
and
in
a
very
short
time
they
reached
noroe
hersebom
was
carried
to
his
bed
and
his
wounds
were
dressed
with
arnica
he
was
fed
with
broth
and
given
a
glass
of
beer
and
in
a
short
time
he
recovered
consciousness
his
injuries
were
not
of
a
very
grave
nature
one
of
his
arms
was
fractured
and
his
body
was
covered
with
wound
and
bruises
but
malarius
insisted
that
he
should
remain
quiet
and
rest
and
not
fatigue
himself
by
attempting
to
talk
he
was
soon
sleeping
peacefully
it
was
not
until
the
next
day
that
they
permitted
him
to
speak
and
explain
in
a
few
words
what
had
happened
to
him
he
had
been
overtaken
by
the
cyclone
just
as
he
had
hoisted
his
sail
to
return
to
noroe
he
had
been
dashed
against
the
rocks
of
the
island
and
his
boat
had
been
broken
into
a
thousand
pieces
and
carried
away
by
the
waves
he
had
thrown
himself
into
the
sea
to
escape
the
frightful
shock
when
she
struck
but
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
he
had
been
dashed
by
the
waves
upon
the
rocks
and
terribly
wounded
he
had
only
been
able
to
drag
himself
beyond
the
reach
of
the
waves
exhausted
by
fatigue
one
arm
broken
and
his
whole
body
covered
with
wounds
he
had
lain
in
an
unconscious
state
unable
to
move
he
could
give
no
account
of
the
manner
in
which
he
had
passed
the
twenty
hours
doubtless
he
had
either
been
delirious
or
unconscious
now
that
he
was
saved
he
began
to
lament
for
the
loss
of
his
boat
and
because
of
his
broken
arm
which
was
now
in
splints
what
would
become
of
him
even
admitting
that
he
might
be
able
to
use
his
arm
again
after
eight
or
ten
weeks
the
boat
was
the
only
capital
possessed
by
the
family
and
the
boat
had
been
broken
to
pieces
by
the
wind
it
would
be
very
hard
for
a
man
of
his
age
to
be
compelled
to
work
for
others
besides
could
he
find
work
it
was
very
doubtful
for
nobody
in
noroe
employed
any
assistant
and
the
factory
even
had
lately
reduced
its
hands
such
were
the
bitter
reflections
of
hersebom
while
he
lay
upon
his
bed
of
pain
and
he
felt
still
worse
when
he
was
able
to
get
up
and
occupy
his
accustomed
seat
in
his
while
waiting
for
his
complete
recovery
the
family
lived
upon
such
provisions
as
they
had
in
the
house
and
by
the
sale
of
the
salt
which
still
remained
but
the
future
looked
very
dark
and
nobody
could
see
how
it
was
to
be
lightened
this
imminent
distress
had
given
a
new
turn
to
erik
thoughts
for
two
or
three
days
he
reflected
that
it
was
by
his
good
fortune
that
hersebom
had
been
discovered
how
could
he
help
feeling
proud
when
he
saw
dame
katrina
and
vanda
look
at
him
with
intense
gratitude
as
they
said
dear
erik
our
father
saved
you
from
the
waves
and
now
in
your
turn
you
have
snatched
him
from
death
certainly
it
was
the
highest
recompense
that
he
could
desire
for
the
of
which
he
had
given
such
a
noble
proof
in
condemning
himself
to
a
fisherman
life
to
feel
that
he
had
been
able
to
render
his
adopted
family
such
an
inestimable
benefit
was
to
him
a
thought
full
of
sweetness
and
strength
this
family
who
had
so
generously
shared
with
him
all
that
they
possessed
were
now
in
trouble
and
in
want
of
food
but
could
he
remain
to
be
a
burden
to
them
was
it
not
rather
his
duty
to
try
and
do
something
to
assist
them
erik
did
not
doubt
his
obligation
to
do
this
he
only
hesitated
as
to
the
best
way
for
him
to
do
it
should
he
go
to
bergen
and
become
a
sailor
or
was
there
some
better
occupation
open
to
him
where
he
could
be
immediately
useful
to
them
he
resolved
to
consult
malarius
who
listened
to
his
reasons
and
approved
of
them
but
did
not
think
well
of
his
project
of
becoming
a
sailor
i
understood
but
i
deplored
your
decision
when
you
were
resigned
to
remain
here
and
share
the
life
of
your
adopted
parents
but
i
can
not
understand
why
you
should
condemn
yourself
to
the
life
of
a
sailor
which
would
take
you
far
away
from
them
when
doctor
schwaryencrona
offers
you
every
advantage
to
pursue
a
more
congenial
career
said
malarius
reflect
my
dear
child
before
you
make
such
a
decision
malarius
did
not
tell
him
that
he
had
already
written
to
stockholm
to
inform
the
doctor
of
the
sad
state
of
their
affairs
and
the
change
which
the
cyclone
of
the
of
march
had
made
in
the
circumstances
of
erik
family
he
was
not
surprised
when
three
days
after
his
conversation
with
erik
he
received
the
following
letter
which
he
lost
no
time
in
carrying
to
the
house
of
hersebom
the
letter
read
as
follows
stockholm
march
my
dear
malarius
i
thank
you
cordially
for
informing
me
of
the
disastrous
consequences
of
the
cyclone
of
the
of
march
to
the
worthy
hersebom
i
am
proud
and
happy
to
learn
that
erik
acted
in
these
circumstances
as
always
before
like
a
brave
boy
and
a
devoted
son
you
will
find
a
check
in
this
letter
for
kroners
and
i
beg
you
to
give
them
to
him
from
me
tell
him
if
it
is
not
enough
to
buy
at
bergen
a
boat
he
must
let
me
know
without
delay
he
must
name
this
boat
and
then
present
it
to
hersebom
as
a
souvenir
of
filial
love
that
done
if
erik
wishes
to
please
me
he
will
return
to
stockholm
and
resume
his
studies
his
place
is
always
ready
for
him
at
my
fireside
and
if
he
needs
a
motive
to
assist
in
this
decision
i
add
that
i
have
at
length
obtained
some
information
and
hope
yet
to
be
able
to
solve
the
mystery
enshrouding
his
birth
believe
me
my
dear
malarius
your
sincere
and
devoted
friend
schwaryencrona
you
may
imagine
with
what
joy
this
letter
was
received
the
doctor
by
sending
this
gift
to
erik
showed
that
he
understood
the
character
of
the
old
fisherman
if
he
had
offered
it
directly
to
him
it
is
hardly
probable
that
hersebom
would
have
accepted
it
but
he
could
not
refuse
the
boat
from
erik
hand
and
bearing
the
name
of
cynthia
which
recalled
how
erik
had
become
a
member
of
the
family
their
only
grief
now
which
already
began
to
sadden
all
their
countenances
was
the
thought
that
he
must
soon
leave
them
again
nobody
dared
to
speak
about
it
although
it
was
constantly
in
their
thoughts
erik
himself
with
his
head
bowed
was
divided
between
the
desire
of
satisfying
the
doctor
and
realizing
the
secret
wishes
of
his
own
heart
and
the
no
less
natural
wish
of
giving
no
offense
to
his
adopted
parents
it
was
vanda
who
first
broke
the
reserve
and
spoke
upon
the
subject
erik
she
said
in
her
sweet
grave
voice
you
can
not
say
to
the
doctor
after
receiving
such
a
letter
you
can
not
do
it
because
it
would
be
treating
him
most
ungratefully
and
sinning
against
yourself
your
place
is
among
scholars
and
not
among
fishermen
i
have
thought
so
for
a
long
time
nobody
has
dared
to
tell
you
therefore
i
tell
you
vanda
is
right
said
malarius
with
a
smile
vanda
is
right
repeated
dame
katrina
drying
her
eyes
and
in
this
manner
for
the
second
time
erik
departure
was
decided
chapter
viii
patrick
the
information
which
schwaryencrona
had
received
was
not
very
important
but
it
sufficed
to
start
his
inquiries
in
a
new
direction
he
had
learned
the
name
of
the
of
the
canadian
transportation
company
it
was
joshua
churchill
but
they
did
not
know
what
had
become
of
this
gentleman
since
the
dissolution
of
the
company
if
they
could
succeed
in
finding
him
he
might
be
able
to
give
them
some
information
about
the
old
records
of
the
company
perhaps
there
might
have
been
a
list
of
the
passengers
by
the
cynthia
and
the
baby
might
have
been
registered
with
his
family
or
with
the
persons
who
had
charge
of
him
but
their
investigations
proved
very
unsatisfactory
the
solicitor
who
had
formerly
had
the
books
in
his
possession
as
the
receiver
of
the
company
about
ten
years
before
did
not
know
what
had
become
of
churchill
for
a
moment
schwaryencrona
consoled
himself
with
a
false
hope
he
remembered
that
the
american
newspapers
usually
published
a
list
of
the
passengers
embarking
for
europe
and
he
sent
for
a
number
of
old
gazettes
to
see
if
he
could
find
the
cynthia
list
but
he
was
soon
convinced
that
this
was
a
fruitless
effort
he
discovered
that
the
practice
of
publishing
the
names
of
passengers
on
european
steamships
was
of
comparatively
recent
date
but
the
old
gazettes
were
of
one
use
to
him
they
gave
the
exact
date
of
sailing
of
the
cynthia
which
had
left
on
the
of
november
not
from
a
canadian
port
as
they
had
at
first
supposed
but
from
new
york
to
go
to
hamburg
it
was
therefore
in
new
york
that
the
doctor
must
first
make
his
investigations
and
if
unsuccessful
then
in
other
parts
of
the
united
states
at
hamburg
all
his
inquiries
proved
to
be
useless
the
consignee
of
the
canadian
transportation
company
knew
nothing
about
the
passengers
of
the
cynthia
and
could
only
give
them
information
about
the
freight
which
they
had
already
obtained
erik
had
been
in
stockholm
six
months
when
they
learned
that
the
joshua
churchill
had
died
several
years
before
in
an
hospital
without
leaving
any
known
heirs
or
probably
any
money
as
for
the
registers
of
the
company
they
had
probably
been
sold
long
before
as
waste
paper
these
long
researches
led
to
nothing
except
to
provoke
the
sarcasms
of
bredejord
which
were
wounding
to
the
doctor
who
however
did
not
as
yet
give
way
to
despair
erik
history
was
now
well
known
in
the
doctor
household
they
no
longer
forbore
to
speak
openly
about
it
and
the
results
of
their
researches
were
talked
of
both
in
the
and
the
parlor
perhaps
the
doctor
had
acted
more
discreetly
during
the
first
two
years
of
erik
sojourn
with
him
when
he
had
kept
his
affairs
a
secret
now
they
furnished
food
for
the
gossiping
of
kajsa
and
dame
greta
and
even
occupied
the
thoughts
of
erik
himself
and
his
reflections
were
often
very
melancholy
not
to
know
whether
his
parents
were
still
living
to
reflect
that
he
might
never
be
able
to
discover
the
secret
of
his
birth
was
in
itself
a
sad
thought
to
him
but
it
was
still
more
sad
to
be
ignorant
of
the
land
of
his
birth
the
poorest
child
in
the
streets
the
most
miserable
peasant
knew
at
least
what
his
country
was
and
to
what
branch
of
the
great
human
family
he
belonged
he
would
sometimes
say
to
himself
as
he
thought
of
those
things
but
i
am
ignorant
of
all
this
i
am
cast
on
the
globe
like
a
waif
like
a
grain
of
dust
tossed
by
the
winds
and
nobody
knows
where
i
came
from
i
have
no
tradition
no
past
the
spot
where
my
mother
was
born
and
where
her
ashes
now
rest
is
perhaps
profaned
and
trodden
under
foot
and
i
am
powerless
to
defend
and
protect
it
these
thoughts
saddened
erik
sometimes
he
would
tell
himself
that
he
had
a
mother
in
dame
katrina
and
a
home
at
hersebom
and
that
noroe
was
his
country
he
vowed
that
he
would
repay
their
kindness
to
him
fourfold
and
would
always
be
a
devoted
son
to
norway
but
still
he
felt
himself
in
an
exceptional
position
sometimes
when
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
himself
in
a
mirror
he
could
observe
the
physical
difference
between
himself
and
those
surrounding
him
the
color
of
his
eyes
and
his
skin
often
occasioned
him
gloomy
reflections
sometimes
he
would
ask
himself
which
country
he
would
prefer
to
be
a
native
of
if
he
had
a
choice
and
he
studied
history
and
geography
that
he
might
become
better
acquainted
with
the
civilization
of
different
countries
and
with
the
habits
of
their
inhabitants
it
was
a
sort
of
consolation
to
him
to
believe
that
he
belonged
to
the
celtic
race
and
he
sought
in
books
a
confirmation
of
the
theory
of
the
doctor
but
when
the
learned
man
repeated
that
in
his
opinion
he
was
certainly
irish
erik
felt
depressed
why
among
all
the
celtic
race
should
he
belong
to
the
people
who
were
the
most
oppressed
if
he
had
felt
absolutely
sure
of
this
he
would
have
loved
this
unfortunate
country
but
all
proof
being
wanting
why
might
he
not
rather
believe
that
he
was
french
there
were
certainly
celts
in
france
and
it
was
a
country
that
he
would
have
been
proud
to
claim
as
his
own
with
her
glorious
traditions
her
dramatic
history
and
her
fruitful
principles
which
she
had
disseminated
all
over
the
world
oh
he
could
have
passionately
loved
and
served
with
devotion
such
a
country
he
would
have
felt
a
filial
interest
in
studying
her
glorious
annals
in
reading
the
works
of
her
great
authors
and
in
studying
her
poets
but
alas
all
these
delicate
emotions
were
denied
him
and
he
felt
that
the
problem
of
his
origin
would
never
be
solved
since
after
so
many
years
spent
in
making
inquiries
they
had
learned
nothing
however
it
seemed
to
erik
that
if
he
could
pursue
these
inquiries
himself
and
follow
up
the
information
already
obtained
that
he
might
discover
something
which
might
lead
to
some
result
and
his
activity
and
zeal
might
succeed
where
money
had
failed
would
he
not
work
with
an
ardor
which
must
overcome
all
difficulties
this
idea
took
possession
of
his
mind
and
insensibly
had
a
marked
effect
in
his
studies
giving
them
a
special
direction
although
he
was
not
aware
of
this
fact
himself
as
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
travel
he
commenced
to
study
cosmography
and
nautical
matters
in
fact
everything
that
was
taught
in
the
school
for
marines
some
day
he
said
to
himself
i
will
pass
my
examination
as
a
captain
and
then
i
shall
go
to
new
york
in
my
own
vessel
and
pursue
my
inquiries
with
regard
to
the
as
a
natural
consequence
this
project
of
personally
investigating
the
matter
of
his
birth
soon
became
known
for
he
was
candor
itself
schwaryencrona
bredejord
and
professor
hochstedt
ended
by
becoming
interested
and
finally
adopted
his
views
as
their
own
the
question
of
erik
birth
which
had
at
first
only
been
an
interesting
problem
in
their
eyes
engrossed
them
more
and
more
they
saw
how
much
erik
took
it
to
heart
and
as
they
were
sincerely
attached
to
him
they
realized
how
important
it
was
to
him
and
they
were
disposed
to
do
everything
in
their
power
to
cast
some
light
upon
the
mystery
one
fine
evening
just
as
the
vacation
was
approaching
it
occurred
to
them
that
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
make
an
excursion
to
new
york
together
and
see
if
they
could
obtain
any
further
news
about
the
matter
who
first
conceived
this
idea
was
a
disputed
point
among
them
and
gave
rise
to
many
discussions
between
the
doctor
and
bredejord
each
claiming
a
priority
doubtless
it
occurred
to
them
both
simultaneously
but
be
this
as
it
may
the
proposal
was
adopted
unanimously
and
in
the
month
of
september
the
three
friends
accompanied
by
erik
embarked
at
christiana
for
new
york
ten
days
later
they
had
reached
that
city
and
opened
communication
with
the
house
of
jeremiah
smith
walker
company
from
whom
they
had
received
the
first
intelligence
and
now
a
new
agent
appeared
on
the
scene
whose
assistance
they
had
had
little
suspicion
of
and
this
was
erik
himself
in
new
york
he
only
saw
what
would
assist
him
in
his
search
he
was
up
at
daybreak
visiting
the
wharves
accosting
the
sailors
whom
he
might
chance
to
meet
working
with
indefatigable
activity
to
collect
the
most
minute
intelligence
do
you
know
anything
about
the
canadian
transportation
company
could
you
tell
me
of
any
officer
or
passenger
or
sailor
who
had
sailed
on
the
he
asked
everywhere
thanks
to
his
perfect
knowledge
of
the
english
language
his
sweet
and
serious
countenance
and
his
familiarity
with
everything
pertaining
to
the
sea
he
was
well
received
everywhere
they
mentioned
to
him
successively
several
old
officers
sailors
and
employs
of
the
canadian
transportation
company
sometimes
he
was
able
to
find
them
sometimes
all
traces
of
them
were
lost
but
none
of
them
could
give
him
any
useful
information
about
the
last
voyage
of
the
cynthia
it
took
fifteen
days
of
walking
and
searching
incessantly
to
obtain
one
little
bit
of
information
which
might
prove
valuable
among
all
the
confused
and
contradictory
accounts
which
were
poured
into
poor
erik
willing
ears
this
one
little
truth
however
seemed
to
be
worth
its
weight
in
gold
they
assured
him
that
a
sailor
named
patrick
had
survived
the
shipwreck
of
the
cynthia
and
had
even
returned
to
new
york
several
times
since
that
eventful
voyage
this
patrick
had
been
on
the
cynthia
on
her
last
voyage
and
had
been
a
special
attendant
of
the
captain
in
all
probability
he
would
know
the
passengers
who
always
eat
at
the
captain
table
they
judged
by
the
fineness
of
the
infant
clothing
that
he
belonged
to
this
class
it
was
now
a
matter
of
the
greatest
importance
to
find
this
sailor
this
was
the
conclusion
of
schwaryencrona
and
bredejord
when
erik
informed
them
of
his
discovery
when
he
returned
to
the
fifth
avenue
hotel
to
dinner
as
usual
it
led
to
a
discussion
since
the
doctor
tried
to
draw
from
this
discovery
a
confirmation
of
his
favorite
theory
if
ever
there
was
an
irish
name
he
cried
patrick
is
one
did
i
not
always
say
that
i
was
sure
that
erik
was
of
irish
birth
does
this
discovery
prove
it
asked
bredejord
laughing
an
irish
does
not
prove
much
it
would
be
difficult
i
fancy
to
find
an
american
vessel
without
one
or
two
natives
of
erin
among
her
crew
they
discussed
the
matter
for
two
or
three
hours
neither
of
them
willing
to
give
way
to
the
other
from
that
day
erik
devoted
all
his
energies
to
the
task
of
finding
patrick
he
was
not
successful
it
is
true
but
by
force
of
seeking
and
questioning
he
discovered
a
sailor
who
had
known
this
man
and
who
was
able
to
give
him
some
information
patrick
was
a
native
of
the
county
cork
he
was
between
and
years
old
of
medium
height
with
red
hair
black
eyes
and
a
nose
which
had
been
broken
by
some
accident
a
boy
one
would
remember
among
a
thousand
said
the
sailor
i
recollect
him
very
well
although
i
have
not
seen
him
for
seven
or
eight
years
is
it
in
new
york
you
usually
meet
him
asked
erik
yes
in
new
york
and
in
other
places
but
the
last
time
was
in
new
york
do
you
know
any
one
who
could
give
me
any
information
about
him
so
that
i
could
find
out
what
has
become
of
him
no
unless
it
is
the
proprietor
of
the
hotel
called
the
red
anchor
in
brooklyn
patrick
lodges
there
when
he
is
in
new
york
the
name
of
the
is
bowles
and
he
is
an
old
sailor
if
he
does
not
know
i
do
not
know
of
any
one
else
who
can
tell
you
anything
about
him
erik
hurried
on
board
one
of
the
that
cross
the
east
river
and
ten
minutes
later
he
was
in
brooklyn
at
the
of
the
red
anchor
he
saw
an
old
woman
who
was
neatly
dressed
and
busily
occupied
in
peeling
potatoes
is
bowles
at
home
he
said
saluting
her
politely
after
the
custom
of
his
adopted
country
he
is
at
home
but
he
is
taking
a
nap
answered
the
good
woman
looking
with
curiosity
at
her
questioner
if
you
have
any
message
for
him
you
can
give
it
to
me
i
am
mrs
bowles
oh
madam
you
can
no
doubt
give
me
the
information
i
desire
as
well
as
bowles
answered
erik
i
wish
to
know
whether
you
are
acquainted
with
a
sailor
named
patrick
and
whether
he
is
now
with
you
or
if
you
can
tell
me
where
i
can
find
him
patrick
yes
i
know
him
but
it
is
five
or
six
years
since
he
has
been
here
and
i
am
unable
to
say
where
he
is
now
erik
countenance
displayed
such
great
disappointment
that
the
old
woman
was
touched
are
you
so
anxious
to
find
patrick
that
you
are
disappointed
in
not
finding
him
here
she
asked
yes
indeed
he
answered
he
alone
can
solve
a
mystery
that
i
shall
seek
all
my
life
to
make
clear
during
the
three
weeks
that
erik
had
been
running
everywhere
in
search
of
information
he
gained
a
certain
amount
of
experience
in
human
nature
he
saw
that
the
curiosity
of
bowles
was
aroused
by
his
questions
he
therefore
entered
the
hotel
and
asked
for
a
glass
of
the
low
room
in
which
he
found
himself
was
furnished
with
green
tables
and
wooden
chairs
but
it
was
empty
this
circumstance
emboldened
erik
to
enter
into
conversation
with
bowles
when
she
handed
him
the
bottle
of
which
he
had
ordered
you
are
doubtless
wondering
madam
what
i
can
want
with
patrick
and
i
will
tell
you
said
he
with
a
smile
an
american
vessel
called
the
was
lost
about
seventeen
years
ago
on
the
coast
of
norway
patrick
was
employed
on
board
i
was
picked
up
by
a
norwegian
fisherman
when
i
was
about
nine
months
old
i
was
floating
in
a
cradle
attached
to
a
buoy
of
the
i
am
seeking
to
see
if
he
can
give
me
any
information
about
my
family
or
at
least
about
my
country
bowles
uttered
a
cry
that
put
a
stop
to
erik
explanation
to
a
buoy
do
you
say
you
were
tied
to
a
buoy
but
without
waiting
for
any
reply
she
ran
to
the
stairway
bowles
bowles
come
down
quickly
she
cried
in
a
piercing
voice
on
a
buoy
you
are
the
child
who
was
tied
to
the
buoy
who
ever
would
have
expected
such
a
thing
to
happen
she
said
as
she
returned
to
erik
who
had
turned
pale
from
surprise
was
he
going
to
learn
the
secret
which
he
was
so
anxious
to
make
out
a
heavy
footstep
was
heard
on
the
stairs
and
soon
an
old
man
fat
and
rosy
clothed
in
a
complete
suit
of
blue
cloth
and
with
gold
rings
in
his
ears
appeared
on
the
threshold
what
is
the
matter
he
asked
rubbing
his
eyes
here
is
somebody
who
wants
you
said
bowles
sit
down
and
listen
to
the
gentleman
who
will
repeat
what
he
has
told
me
bowles
obeyed
without
any
protestation
erik
did
the
same
he
repeated
in
as
few
words
as
he
could
what
he
had
told
the
old
woman
as
he
listened
the
countenance
of
bowles
dilated
like
a
full
moon
his
lips
parted
in
a
broad
smile
and
he
looked
at
his
wife
and
rubbed
his
hands
she
on
her
side
appeared
equally
well
pleased
must
i
suppose
that
you
are
already
acquainted
with
my
story
asked
erik
with
a
beating
heart
bowles
made
an
affirmative
sign
and
scratching
his
ear
made
up
his
mind
to
speak
i
know
it
without
your
telling
me
he
said
at
length
and
my
wife
knows
it
as
well
as
i
do
we
have
often
talked
about
it
without
understanding
it
erik
pale
and
with
tightly
compressed
lips
hung
upon
his
words
expecting
some
revelation
but
this
he
had
to
wait
for
bowles
had
not
the
gift
of
either
eloquence
or
clearness
and
perhaps
his
ideas
were
still
clouded
with
sleep
and
in
order
to
recover
his
faculties
he
took
two
or
three
glasses
of
a
liquor
called
pick
me
up
which
greatly
resembled
gin
after
his
wife
had
placed
the
bottle
and
two
glasses
before
him
and
he
had
sufficiently
fortified
himself
he
began
to
speak
his
story
was
so
confused
and
mingled
with
so
many
useless
details
that
it
was
impossible
to
draw
any
conclusions
from
it
but
erik
listened
attentively
to
all
he
said
and
by
questioning
and
insisting
and
aided
by
bowles
he
ended
by
gathering
some
facts
about
himself
chapter
ix
in
which
a
reward
of
five
hundred
pounds
sterling
is
offered
patrick
as
far
as
erik
could
make
out
through
rambling
account
of
him
was
not
a
model
of
virtue
the
proprietor
of
the
red
anchor
had
known
him
as
a
and
sailor
both
before
and
after
the
loss
of
the
cynthia
up
to
that
time
patrick
had
been
poor
as
all
sailors
are
after
the
shipwreck
he
had
returned
from
europe
with
a
large
bundle
of
pretending
to
have
inherited
some
money
in
ireland
which
seemed
likely
enough
bowles
however
had
never
believed
in
this
inheritance
he
thought
that
this
sudden
accession
of
wealth
was
connected
in
some
way
with
the
loss
of
the
cynthia
and
that
patrick
was
afraid
to
say
so
for
it
was
evident
that
contrary
to
the
usual
habit
of
seamen
in
such
cases
he
carefully
avoided
speaking
about
the
sad
occurrence
he
would
always
turn
the
conversation
if
any
one
alluded
to
it
before
him
and
he
was
very
anxious
to
start
on
a
long
voyage
before
the
lawsuit
brought
by
the
company
to
recover
the
insurance
due
on
the
cynthia
should
take
place
he
did
not
wish
to
be
summoned
as
a
witness
this
conduct
appeared
very
suspicious
as
he
was
the
sole
known
survivor
from
the
shipwreck
bowles
and
his
wife
had
always
suspected
him
but
they
had
kept
their
own
counsel
what
looked
still
more
suspicious
was
the
fact
that
when
patrick
was
in
new
york
he
was
never
short
of
money
he
brought
back
very
little
with
him
after
a
voyage
but
a
few
days
after
his
return
he
always
had
gold
and
and
when
he
was
tipsy
which
frequently
happened
he
would
boast
of
being
in
possession
of
a
secret
which
was
worth
a
fortune
to
him
the
words
which
most
frequently
escaped
from
his
lips
were
the
baby
tied
to
the
buoy
the
baby
tied
to
the
buoy
he
would
say
striking
the
table
with
his
fist
the
baby
tied
to
the
buoy
is
worth
its
weight
in
gold
then
he
would
laugh
as
if
well
satisfied
with
himself
but
they
could
never
draw
out
of
him
any
explanation
of
these
words
and
for
many
years
the
bowles
household
were
lost
in
conjectures
as
to
what
they
could
possibly
mean
this
accounted
for
bowles
excitement
when
erik
suddenly
announced
to
her
that
he
was
the
famous
baby
who
had
been
tied
to
a
buoy
patrick
who
had
been
in
the
habit
of
lodging
at
the
red
anchor
whenever
he
was
in
new
york
for
more
than
fifteen
years
had
not
been
seen
there
now
for
more
than
four
years
there
had
also
been
something
mysterious
about
his
last
departure
he
had
received
a
visit
from
a
man
who
had
been
closeted
with
him
for
more
than
an
hour
after
this
visit
patrick
who
had
seemed
worried
and
troubled
had
paid
his
board
bill
taken
his
carpet
bag
and
left
in
a
hurry
they
had
never
seen
him
since
that
day
and
bowles
were
naturally
ignorant
of
the
cause
of
his
sudden
departure
but
they
had
always
thought
that
it
had
some
connection
with
the
loss
of
the
cynthia
in
their
opinion
the
visitor
had
come
to
warn
patrick
of
some
danger
which
threatened
him
and
the
irishman
had
thought
it
prudent
to
leave
new
york
immediately
bowles
did
not
think
he
had
ever
returned
if
he
had
done
so
they
would
have
been
sure
to
hear
of
him
through
other
seamen
who
frequented
their
house
and
who
would
have
been
astonished
if
patrick
had
boarded
anywhere
else
and
would
have
been
sure
to
ask
questions
as
to
the
reasons
for
his
doing
so
this
was
the
substance
of
the
story
related
to
erik
and
he
hastened
to
communicate
it
to
his
friends
his
report
was
naturally
received
with
all
the
interest
which
it
merited
for
the
first
time
after
so
many
years
they
were
on
the
track
of
a
man
who
had
made
reiterated
allusions
to
the
baby
tied
to
a
buoy
it
was
true
they
did
not
know
where
this
man
was
but
they
hoped
to
find
him
some
day
it
was
the
most
important
piece
of
news
which
they
had
as
yet
obtained
they
resolved
to
telegraph
to
bowles
and
beg
her
to
prepare
a
dinner
for
six
persons
bredejord
had
suggested
this
idea
as
a
good
means
of
drawing
the
worthy
couple
out
for
while
they
talked
during
the
dinner
they
might
be
able
to
glean
some
new
facts
erik
had
little
hopes
of
obtaining
any
further
information
he
thought
that
he
already
knew
and
bowles
well
enough
to
be
convinced
that
they
had
told
him
all
that
they
knew
but
he
did
not
take
into
account
bredejord
skill
in
questioning
witnesses
and
in
drawing
from
them
information
which
they
themselves
were
scarcely
aware
of
bowles
had
surpassed
herself
in
preparing
the
dinner
she
had
laid
the
table
in
the
best
room
on
the
first
floor
she
felt
very
much
flattered
at
being
invited
to
partake
of
it
in
the
society
of
such
distinguished
guests
and
answered
willingly
all
of
questions
they
gathered
from
this
conversation
a
certain
number
of
facts
which
were
not
unimportant
one
was
that
patrick
had
said
at
the
time
of
the
lawsuit
against
the
insurance
company
that
he
was
going
away
to
avoid
being
summoned
as
a
witness
this
was
evident
proof
that
he
did
not
wish
to
explain
the
circumstances
under
which
the
shipwreck
had
occurred
and
his
subsequent
conduct
confirmed
this
theory
it
was
also
evident
that
in
new
york
or
its
environs
he
received
the
suspicious
revenue
which
seemed
to
be
connected
with
his
secret
for
when
he
arrived
he
was
always
without
money
but
after
he
had
been
about
for
a
short
time
he
always
returned
with
his
pockets
full
of
gold
they
could
not
doubt
that
his
secret
was
connected
with
the
infant
tied
to
the
buoy
for
he
had
frequently
affirmed
that
such
was
the
case
the
evening
before
his
sudden
departure
patrick
had
said
that
he
was
tired
of
a
life
and
that
he
thought
he
should
give
up
making
voyages
and
settle
in
new
york
for
the
remainder
of
his
life
lastly
the
individual
who
had
called
to
see
patrick
was
interested
in
his
departure
for
he
had
called
the
next
day
and
asked
for
the
irishman
who
was
boarding
at
the
red
anchor
and
had
seemed
pleased
to
hear
that
he
was
no
longer
there
bowles
felt
sure
that
he
would
recognize
this
man
if
he
saw
him
again
by
his
conversation
and
actions
he
had
believed
him
to
be
a
detective
or
some
agent
of
the
police
bredejord
concluded
from
these
facts
that
patrick
had
been
systematically
frightened
by
the
person
from
whom
he
drew
the
money
and
that
this
man
had
been
sent
to
make
him
fear
that
criminal
proceedings
were
about
to
be
taken
against
him
this
would
explain
his
precipitate
flight
and
why
he
had
never
returned
to
new
york
it
was
important
to
find
this
detective
as
well
as
patrick
and
bowles
by
referring
to
their
books
were
able
to
give
the
exact
date
of
the
irishman
departure
which
was
four
years
lacking
three
months
although
they
had
previously
believed
that
it
was
four
or
five
years
ago
schwaryencrona
was
immediately
struck
by
the
fact
that
the
date
of
his
departure
and
consequently
of
the
visit
of
the
detective
corresponded
precisely
with
the
date
of
the
first
advertisements
which
he
had
caused
to
be
made
in
great
britain
for
the
survivors
of
the
cynthia
this
coincidence
was
so
striking
that
it
was
impossible
not
to
believe
that
there
was
some
connection
between
them
they
began
to
understand
the
mystery
a
little
better
the
abandonment
of
erik
on
the
buoy
had
been
the
result
of
some
crime
a
crime
of
which
the
had
been
a
witness
or
an
accomplice
he
knew
the
authors
of
this
crime
who
lived
in
new
york
or
its
environs
and
he
had
for
a
long
time
enjoyed
the
reward
of
his
secrecy
then
a
day
had
come
when
the
excessive
demands
of
the
irishman
had
become
burdensome
and
the
announcement
in
the
newspapers
by
advertisement
had
been
made
use
of
to
frighten
patrick
and
cause
his
hurried
departure
in
any
case
even
if
these
deductions
were
not
correct
in
every
point
they
had
obtained
sufficient
information
to
entitle
them
to
demand
a
judicial
investigation
erik
and
his
friends
therefore
left
the
red
anchor
full
of
hope
that
they
would
soon
obtain
some
favorable
intelligence
the
next
day
bredejord
was
introduced
by
the
swedish
consul
to
the
chief
of
police
of
new
york
and
he
made
him
acquainted
with
the
facts
which
had
become
known
to
him
at
the
same
time
he
entered
into
conversation
with
the
officers
of
the
insurance
company
who
had
refused
to
pay
the
claims
due
on
the
cynthia
and
read
the
old
documents
relative
to
this
matter
which
had
lain
undisturbed
so
many
years
but
the
examination
of
these
papers
did
not
afford
him
any
important
intelligence
the
matter
had
been
decided
upon
technical
points
relating
to
an
excess
of
insurance
far
above
the
value
of
the
vessel
and
cargo
neither
side
had
been
able
to
produce
any
person
who
had
been
a
witness
of
the
shipwreck
the
owners
of
the
cynthia
had
not
been
able
to
prove
their
good
faith
or
to
explain
how
the
shipwreck
had
taken
place
and
the
court
had
decided
in
favor
of
their
adversaries
their
defense
had
been
weak
and
their
opponents
had
triumphed
the
insurance
company
however
had
been
compelled
to
pay
several
claims
on
the
lives
of
the
passengers
to
their
heirs
but
in
all
these
law
proceedings
there
was
no
trace
of
any
infant
nine
months
old
these
examinations
had
occupied
several
days
finally
the
chief
of
police
informed
bredejord
that
he
had
been
unable
to
obtain
any
intelligence
about
the
matter
nobody
in
new
york
knew
any
detective
who
answered
to
bowles
description
nobody
could
tell
who
the
individual
was
who
was
interested
in
the
departure
of
patrick
as
for
this
sailor
he
did
not
appear
to
have
set
his
foot
in
the
united
states
for
at
least
four
years
all
they
could
do
was
to
keep
the
address
of
the
place
where
he
was
born
which
might
prove
useful
some
time
but
the
chief
of
police
told
bredejord
without
any
dissimulation
that
the
affair
had
happened
so
long
ago
now
nearly
twenty
years
that
even
if
patrick
ever
returned
to
new
york
it
was
at
least
doubtful
if
the
authorities
would
be
willing
to
investigate
the
matter
at
the
moment
when
erik
believed
that
he
was
about
to
obtain
a
solution
of
the
mystery
which
clouded
his
life
all
their
investigations
came
to
a
sudden
end
and
without
producing
the
slightest
result
the
only
thing
that
remained
to
be
done
was
to
pass
through
ireland
as
they
returned
to
sweden
to
see
if
perchance
patrick
had
returned
there
to
pass
the
remainder
of
his
days
planting
cabbages
schwaryencrona
and
his
friends
after
taking
leave
of
and
bowles
resolved
to
pursue
this
route
the
steamers
between
new
york
and
liverpool
touch
at
cork
and
this
was
only
a
few
miles
from
innishannon
the
place
where
patrick
was
born
there
they
learned
that
patrick
had
never
returned
to
his
native
place
since
he
left
it
at
the
age
of
twelve
years
and
that
they
had
never
heard
from
him
where
shall
we
look
for
him
now
asked
schwaryencrona
as
they
embarked
for
england
on
the
way
to
stockholm
at
the
seaport
towns
evidently
and
clearly
at
those
which
are
not
american
answered
bredejord
for
note
this
point
a
sailor
a
man
does
not
renounce
his
profession
at
the
age
of
it
is
the
only
one
he
knows
patrick
is
doubtless
still
on
the
sea
and
all
vessels
have
some
port
or
other
for
their
destination
and
it
is
only
there
that
we
can
hope
to
find
this
man
what
do
you
think
hochstedt
your
reasoning
seems
to
be
just
although
not
altogether
indisputable
answered
the
professor
with
his
customary
prudence
admit
that
it
is
right
continued
bredejord
we
know
that
patrick
was
frightened
away
and
would
be
in
dread
of
pursuit
perhaps
of
being
extradited
in
that
case
he
would
avoid
his
old
companions
and
seek
in
preference
ports
where
he
was
not
likely
to
meet
any
of
them
i
know
that
my
ideas
can
be
contradicted
but
let
us
suppose
they
are
well
founded
the
number
of
ports
which
are
not
frequented
by
american
vessels
is
not
very
large
i
think
we
might
begin
by
seeking
in
these
places
news
of
patrick
why
not
have
recourse
to
advertisements
asked
schwaryencrona
because
patrick
would
not
answer
them
if
he
is
trying
to
hide
himself
even
supposing
that
a
sailor
would
be
likely
to
see
your
advertisement
but
you
could
word
your
advertisement
so
as
to
assure
him
that
you
intended
to
do
him
no
injury
but
rather
that
it
would
be
greatly
to
his
advantage
to
communicate
with
you
you
are
right
but
still
i
am
afraid
that
an
ordinary
seaman
would
not
be
likely
to
see
such
an
advertisement
well
you
might
try
offering
a
reward
to
patrick
or
to
any
one
who
would
give
you
information
as
to
where
he
might
be
found
what
do
you
think
about
it
erik
it
seems
to
me
that
such
an
advertisement
to
produce
any
result
would
have
to
be
continued
for
a
long
time
and
in
a
great
many
different
papers
that
would
cost
a
great
deal
and
might
only
frighten
patrick
no
matter
how
well
worded
the
advertisement
might
be
provided
it
is
to
his
interest
to
remain
concealed
would
it
not
be
better
to
employ
some
one
to
visit
personally
those
seaports
which
this
man
would
be
likely
to
frequent
but
where
could
we
find
a
trusty
man
who
would
be
willing
to
undertake
such
a
task
i
can
furnish
one
if
you
wish
it
answered
erik
i
would
go
myself
you
my
dear
child
and
what
would
become
of
your
studies
my
studies
need
not
suffer
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
me
from
pursuing
them
even
during
my
travels
and
another
thing
doctor
i
must
confess
to
you
that
i
have
already
secured
the
means
of
doing
so
without
costing
me
anything
how
is
that
possible
asked
schwaryencrona
bredejord
and
professor
hochstedt
simultaneously
i
have
simply
been
preparing
myself
for
a
life
i
can
pass
the
examination
if
necessary
once
in
possession
of
my
diploma
it
would
be
easy
for
me
to
obtain
a
position
as
a
lieutenant
in
any
and
you
have
done
all
this
without
saying
a
word
to
me
said
the
doctor
half
grieved
while
the
lawyer
and
the
professor
both
laughed
heartily
well
said
erik
i
do
not
think
that
i
have
committed
any
great
crime
i
have
only
made
inquiries
as
to
the
requisite
amount
of
knowledge
and
i
have
mastered
it
i
should
not
have
made
any
use
of
it
without
asking
your
permission
and
i
now
solicit
it
and
i
shall
grant
it
wicked
boy
said
the
doctor
but
to
let
you
set
out
all
alone
now
is
another
matter
we
will
wait
until
you
have
attained
your
majority
erik
submitted
to
this
decision
willingly
and
gratefully
however
the
doctor
was
not
willing
to
give
up
his
own
ideas
to
search
the
personally
he
regarded
as
a
last
expedient
an
advertisement
on
the
other
hand
would
go
everywhere
if
patrick
was
not
hiding
away
they
might
possibly
find
him
by
this
means
if
he
was
hiding
some
one
might
see
it
and
betray
him
he
therefore
had
this
advertisement
written
in
seven
or
eight
different
languages
and
dispatched
to
the
four
quarters
of
the
globe
in
a
hundred
of
the
most
widely
circulated
newspapers
patrick
a
sailor
has
been
absent
from
new
york
for
four
years
a
reward
of
one
hundred
pounds
sterling
will
be
paid
to
any
one
who
can
give
me
news
of
him
five
hundred
pounds
sterling
will
be
given
to
the
said
patrick
if
he
will
communicate
with
the
advertiser
he
need
fear
nothing
as
no
advantage
will
be
taken
of
him
doctor
schwaryencrona
stockholm
by
the
of
october
the
doctor
and
his
companions
had
returned
to
their
homes
the
next
day
the
advertisement
was
sent
to
the
advertising
agency
in
stockholm
and
three
days
afterward
it
had
made
its
appearance
in
several
newspapers
erik
could
not
repress
a
sigh
and
a
presentiment
that
it
would
be
unsuccessful
as
he
read
it
as
for
bredejord
he
declared
openly
that
it
was
the
greatest
folly
in
the
world
and
that
for
the
future
he
considered
the
affair
a
failure
but
erik
and
bredejord
were
deceived
as
events
afterward
proved
chapter
tudor
brown
esquire
one
morning
in
may
the
doctor
was
in
his
office
when
his
servant
brought
him
a
visitor
card
this
card
which
was
small
as
is
usual
in
america
had
the
name
of
tudor
brown
on
board
the
printed
upon
it
tudor
brown
said
the
doctor
trying
to
remember
whom
he
had
ever
known
who
bore
this
name
this
gentleman
asked
to
see
the
doctor
said
the
servant
can
he
not
come
at
my
asked
the
doctor
he
said
his
business
was
about
a
personal
matter
show
him
in
then
said
the
doctor
with
a
sigh
he
lifted
his
head
as
the
door
opened
again
and
was
surprised
when
he
beheld
the
singular
person
who
answered
to
the
feudal
name
of
tudor
and
the
plebeian
name
of
brown
he
was
a
man
about
fifty
years
of
age
his
forehead
was
covered
with
a
profusion
of
little
ringlets
of
a
carroty
color
while
the
most
superficial
examination
betrayed
that
they
were
made
of
curled
silk
his
nose
was
hooked
and
surmounted
with
an
enormous
pair
of
gold
spectacles
his
teeth
were
as
long
as
those
of
a
horse
his
cheeks
were
smooth
but
under
his
chin
he
wore
a
little
red
beard
this
odd
head
covered
by
a
high
hat
which
he
did
not
pretend
to
remove
surmounted
a
thin
angular
body
clothed
from
head
to
foot
in
a
woolen
suit
in
his
cravat
he
wore
a
pin
containing
a
diamond
as
large
as
a
walnut
also
a
large
gold
chain
and
his
vest
buttons
were
amethysts
he
had
a
dozen
rings
on
his
fingers
which
were
as
knotty
as
those
of
a
chimpanzee
altogether
he
was
the
most
pretentious
and
man
that
it
was
possible
to
behold
this
person
entered
the
doctor
office
as
if
he
had
been
entering
a
railway
station
without
even
bowing
he
stopped
to
say
in
a
voice
that
resembled
that
of
punch
its
tone
was
so
nasal
and
guttural
are
you
doctor
schwaryencrona
i
am
answered
the
doctor
very
much
astonished
at
his
manners
he
was
debating
in
his
mind
whether
he
should
ring
for
his
servant
to
conduct
this
offensive
person
to
the
door
when
a
word
put
a
stop
to
his
intention
i
saw
your
advertisement
about
patrick
said
the
stranger
and
i
thought
you
would
like
to
know
that
i
can
tell
you
something
about
him
take
a
seat
sir
answered
the
doctor
but
he
perceived
that
the
stranger
had
not
waited
to
be
asked
after
selecting
the
most
comfortable
he
drew
it
toward
the
doctor
then
he
seated
himself
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
lifted
his
feet
and
placed
his
heels
on
the
and
looked
at
the
doctor
with
the
most
air
in
the
world
i
thought
he
said
that
you
would
listen
to
these
details
with
pleasure
since
you
offer
five
hundred
pounds
for
them
that
is
why
i
have
called
upon
you
the
doctor
bowed
without
saying
a
word
doubtless
continued
the
other
in
his
nasal
voice
you
are
wondering
who
i
am
i
am
going
to
tell
you
my
card
has
informed
you
as
to
my
name
and
i
am
a
british
subject
irish
perhaps
asked
the
doctor
with
interest
the
granger
evidently
surprised
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
said
no
scotch
oh
i
know
i
do
not
look
like
a
scotchman
they
take
me
very
often
for
a
yankee
but
that
is
nothing
i
am
scotch
as
he
gave
this
piece
of
information
he
looked
at
schwaryencrona
as
much
as
to
say
you
can
believe
what
you
please
it
is
a
matter
of
indifference
to
me
from
inverness
perhaps
suggested
the
doctor
still
clinging
to
his
favorite
theory
the
stranger
again
hesitated
for
a
moment
no
from
edinburgh
he
answered
but
that
is
of
no
importance
after
all
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
in
hand
i
have
an
independent
fortune
and
owe
nothing
to
anybody
if
i
tell
you
who
i
am
it
is
because
it
gives
me
pleasure
to
do
so
for
i
am
not
obliged
to
do
it
permit
me
to
observe
that
i
did
not
ask
you
said
the
doctor
smiling
no
but
do
not
interrupt
me
or
we
shall
never
reach
the
end
of
this
matter
you
published
an
advertisement
to
find
out
what
became
of
patrick
did
you
not
you
therefore
have
some
interest
in
knowing
i
know
what
has
become
of
him
you
know
asked
the
doctor
drawing
his
seat
closer
to
that
of
the
stranger
i
know
but
before
i
tell
you
i
want
to
ask
you
what
interest
you
have
in
finding
him
that
is
only
just
answered
the
doctor
in
as
few
words
as
possible
he
related
erik
history
to
which
his
visitor
listened
with
profound
attention
and
this
boy
is
still
living
asked
tudor
brown
assuredly
he
is
living
he
is
in
good
health
and
in
october
next
he
will
begin
his
studies
in
the
medical
university
at
upsal
ah
ah
answered
the
stranger
who
seemed
lost
in
reflection
tell
me
he
said
at
length
have
you
no
other
means
of
solving
this
mystery
of
his
birth
except
by
finding
patrick
i
know
of
no
other
replied
the
doctor
after
years
of
searching
i
only
found
out
that
this
was
in
possession
of
the
secret
that
he
alone
could
reveal
it
to
me
and
that
is
why
i
have
advertised
for
him
in
the
papers
i
must
confess
that
i
had
no
great
hopes
of
finding
him
by
this
means
how
is
that
because
i
had
reasons
for
believing
that
this
has
grave
motives
for
remaining
unknown
consequently
it
was
not
likely
that
he
would
respond
to
my
advertisement
i
had
the
intention
of
resorting
to
other
means
i
have
a
description
of
him
i
know
what
ports
he
would
be
likely
to
frequent
and
i
propose
to
employ
special
agents
to
be
on
the
lookout
for
him
schwaryencrona
did
not
say
this
lightly
he
spoke
with
the
intention
of
seeing
what
effect
these
words
would
produce
on
the
man
before
him
and
as
he
watched
him
intently
he
saw
that
in
spite
of
the
affected
coolness
of
the
stranger
his
eyelids
fell
and
the
muscles
of
his
month
contracted
but
almost
immediately
tudor
brown
recovered
his
and
said
well
doctor
if
you
have
no
other
means
of
solving
this
mystery
except
by
discovering
patrick
i
am
afraid
that
you
will
never
find
it
out
patrick
is
dead
the
doctor
was
too
much
taken
aback
by
this
disappointing
announcement
to
say
a
word
and
only
looked
at
his
visitor
who
continued
dead
and
buried
three
hundred
fathoms
beneath
the
sea
this
man
whose
past
life
always
appeared
to
me
to
have
been
mysterious
was
employed
three
years
on
board
my
yacht
the
i
must
tell
you
that
my
yacht
is
a
stanch
vessel
in
which
i
often
cruise
for
seven
or
eight
months
at
a
time
nearly
three
years
ago
we
were
passing
through
the
straits
of
madeira
when
patrick
fell
overboard
i
had
the
vessel
stopped
and
some
boats
lowered
and
after
a
diligent
search
we
recovered
him
but
though
we
spared
no
pains
to
restore
him
to
life
our
efforts
were
in
vain
patrick
was
dead
we
were
compelled
to
return
to
the
sea
the
prey
which
we
had
snatched
from
it
the
accident
was
put
down
on
the
ship
log
and
recorded
in
the
notary
office
at
the
nearest
place
we
reached
thinking
that
this
act
might
be
useful
to
you
i
have
brought
you
a
certified
copy
of
it
as
he
said
this
tudor
brown
took
out
his
and
presented
the
doctor
with
a
paper
stamped
with
a
notarial
seal
the
latter
read
it
quickly
it
was
a
record
of
the
death
of
patrick
while
passing
through
the
straits
of
madeira
duly
signed
and
sworn
to
before
two
witnesses
as
being
an
exact
copy
of
the
original
it
was
also
registered
in
london
at
somerset
house
by
the
commissioners
of
her
britannic
majesty
this
instrument
was
evidently
authentic
but
the
manner
in
which
he
had
received
it
was
so
strange
that
the
doctor
could
not
conceal
his
astonishment
he
took
it
however
with
his
habitual
courtesy
permit
me
to
ask
one
question
sir
he
said
to
his
visitor
speak
doctor
how
is
it
that
you
have
this
document
in
your
pocket
duly
prepared
and
certified
and
why
have
you
brought
it
to
me
if
i
can
count
you
have
asked
two
questions
said
tudor
brown
i
will
answer
them
however
i
had
this
paper
in
my
pocket
because
i
read
your
advertisement
two
months
ago
and
wishing
to
furnish
you
with
the
information
which
you
asked
for
i
thought
it
better
to
give
it
to
you
in
the
most
complete
and
definite
form
that
lay
in
my
power
i
have
brought
it
to
you
personally
because
i
happened
to
be
cruising
in
these
waters
and
i
wished
at
the
same
time
to
gratify
your
curiosity
and
my
own
there
was
nothing
to
answer
to
this
reasoning
this
was
the
only
conclusion
the
doctor
could
draw
yon
are
here
then
with
the
he
asked
eagerly
without
doubt
and
you
have
still
on
board
some
sailors
who
have
known
patrick
yes
several
would
you
permit
me
to
see
them
as
many
as
you
please
will
you
accompany
me
on
board
now
if
you
have
no
objection
i
have
none
said
the
stranger
as
he
arose
schwaryencrona
touched
his
bell
and
they
brought
him
his
fur
pelisse
his
hat
and
his
cane
and
he
departed
with
tudor
brown
fifteen
minutes
later
they
were
on
board
the
albatross
they
were
received
by
an
old
seaman
with
a
rubicund
face
whose
open
countenance
betrayed
only
truth
and
loyalty
ward
this
gentleman
wishes
to
make
some
inquiries
about
the
fate
of
patrick
said
tudor
brown
patrick
answered
the
old
sailor
god
rest
his
soul
he
gave
us
trouble
enough
to
pick
him
up
the
day
he
was
drowned
in
the
straits
of
madeira
what
is
the
use
of
inquiries
now
that
he
has
gone
to
feed
the
fishes
had
you
known
him
for
a
long
time
asked
the
doctor
the
rascal
no
for
a
year
or
two
perhaps
i
believe
that
it
was
at
zanzibar
that
we
took
him
on
board
am
i
right
tommy
duff
is
any
one
hailing
me
asked
a
young
sailor
who
was
busily
employed
in
polishing
a
copper
bowl
come
here
said
the
other
was
it
at
zanzibar
that
we
recruited
patrick
patrick
repeated
the
young
sailor
as
if
his
remembrance
of
the
man
was
not
very
good
oh
yes
i
remember
him
the
man
who
fell
overboard
in
the
straits
of
maderia
yes
ward
it
was
at
zanzibar
that
he
came
on
board
schwaryencrona
made
him
describe
patrick
and
was
convinced
that
it
was
the
same
man
whom
he
was
seeking
both
these
men
seemed
honest
and
sincere
they
had
honest
and
open
countenances
the
uniformity
of
their
answers
seemed
a
little
strange
and
almost
preconcerted
but
after
all
it
might
be
only
the
natural
consequence
of
relating
facts
having
known
patrick
only
a
year
at
the
most
they
would
have
but
little
to
say
about
him
except
the
fact
of
his
death
besides
the
albatross
was
a
yacht
of
such
large
proportions
that
if
she
had
been
furnished
with
some
cannon
she
might
easily
have
passed
for
a
the
most
rigorous
cleanliness
was
observed
on
board
the
sailors
were
in
good
condition
well
clothed
and
under
perfect
discipline
the
general
appearance
of
the
vessel
insensiby
acted
upon
the
doctor
and
carried
conviction
of
the
truth
of
the
statement
which
he
had
just
heard
he
therefore
declared
himself
perfectly
satisfied
and
could
not
leave
without
inviting
tudor
brown
to
dine
with
him
but
tudor
brown
did
not
think
it
best
to
accept
this
invitation
he
declined
it
in
these
courteous
terms
no
i
can
not
i
never
dine
in
town
it
now
only
remained
for
schwaryencrona
to
retire
this
he
did
without
having
obtained
even
the
slightest
bow
from
this
strange
individual
the
doctor
first
thought
was
to
go
and
relate
his
adventure
to
bredejord
who
listened
to
him
without
saying
a
word
only
promising
himself
to
institute
counter
inquiries
but
he
with
erik
who
had
been
told
the
whole
story
upon
his
return
from
school
repaired
to
the
vessel
to
see
if
they
could
elicit
any
further
information
but
the
albatross
had
left
stockholm
without
leaving
word
where
she
was
going
and
they
could
not
therefore
obtain
even
the
address
of
tudor
brown
all
that
resulted
from
this
affair
was
the
possession
of
the
document
which
legally
proved
the
death
of
patrick
was
this
paper
of
any
value
this
was
the
question
that
bredejord
could
not
help
doubting
in
spite
of
the
evidence
of
the
british
consul
at
stockholm
whom
he
questioned
and
who
declared
that
the
signatures
and
stamp
were
perfectly
authentic
he
also
caused
inquiries
to
be
made
at
edinburgh
but
nobody
knew
tudor
brown
which
he
thought
looked
suspicious
but
it
was
an
undeniable
fact
that
they
obtained
no
further
intelligence
of
patrick
and
all
their
advertisements
were
ineffectual
if
patrick
had
disappeared
for
good
they
had
no
hope
of
penetrating
the
mystery
that
surrounded
erik
birth
he
himself
saw
this
and
was
obliged
to
recognize
the
fact
that
for
the
future
the
inquiries
would
have
to
be
based
upon
some
other
theory
he
therefore
made
no
opposition
about
commencing
his
medical
studies
the
following
autumn
at
the
university
at
upsal
according
to
the
doctor
wishes
he
only
desired
first
to
pass
his
examination
as
a
captain
but
this
sufficed
to
show
that
he
had
not
renounced
his
project
of
traveling
besides
he
had
another
trouble
which
lay
heavy
at
his
heart
and
for
which
he
saw
no
other
remedy
but
absence
erik
wished
to
find
some
pretext
for
leaving
the
doctor
house
as
soon
as
his
studies
were
completed
but
he
wished
to
do
this
without
exciting
any
suspicion
the
only
pretext
which
he
could
think
of
was
this
plan
of
traveling
he
desired
to
do
this
because
of
the
aversion
of
kajsa
the
doctor
niece
she
lost
no
occasion
of
showing
her
dislike
but
he
would
not
at
any
price
have
had
the
excellent
man
suspect
this
state
of
affairs
between
them
his
relations
toward
the
young
girl
had
always
been
most
singular
in
the
eyes
of
erik
during
these
seven
years
as
well
as
on
the
first
day
of
his
arrival
at
stockholm
the
pretty
little
fairy
had
always
been
a
model
of
elegance
and
all
earthly
perfections
he
had
bestowed
on
her
his
unreserved
admiration
and
had
made
heroic
efforts
to
overcome
her
dislike
and
become
her
friend
but
kajsa
could
not
make
up
her
mind
calmly
to
see
this
intruder
as
she
called
erik
take
his
place
in
the
doctor
home
be
treated
as
an
adopted
son
and
become
a
favorite
of
her
uncle
and
his
friends
the
scholastic
success
of
erik
his
goodness
and
his
gentleness
far
from
making
him
pleasing
in
her
eyes
were
only
new
motives
of
jealousy
in
her
heart
kajsa
could
not
pardon
the
young
man
for
being
only
a
fisherman
and
a
peasant
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
brought
discredit
upon
the
doctor
household
and
on
herself
who
she
liked
to
believe
occupied
a
very
high
position
in
the
social
scale
but
it
was
worse
when
she
learned
that
erik
was
even
less
than
a
peasant
only
a
child
that
had
been
picked
up
that
appeared
to
her
monstrous
and
dishonorable
she
thought
that
such
a
child
had
a
lower
place
in
society
than
a
cat
or
a
dog
she
manifested
these
sentiments
by
the
most
disdainful
looks
the
most
mortifying
silence
and
the
most
cruel
insults
if
erik
was
invited
with
her
to
any
little
social
gathering
at
the
house
of
a
friend
she
would
positively
refuse
to
dance
with
him
at
the
table
she
would
not
answer
anything
he
said
nor
pay
any
attention
to
him
she
tried
on
all
occasions
and
in
every
possible
way
to
humiliate
him
poor
erik
had
divined
the
cause
of
this
uncharitable
conduct
but
he
could
not
understand
how
ignorance
of
his
family
and
of
the
land
of
his
birth
could
be
regarded
by
her
as
such
a
heinous
crime
he
tried
one
day
to
reason
with
kajsa
and
to
make
her
understand
the
injustice
and
cruelty
of
such
a
prejudice
but
she
would
not
even
deign
to
listen
to
him
then
as
they
both
grew
older
the
abyss
which
separated
them
seemed
to
widen
at
eighteen
kajsa
made
her
in
society
she
was
flattered
and
noticed
as
the
rich
heiress
and
this
homage
only
confirmed
her
in
the
opinion
that
she
was
superior
to
common
mortals
erik
who
was
at
first
greatly
afflicted
by
her
disdain
ended
by
becoming
indignant
and
vowing
to
triumph
over
it
this
feeling
of
humiliation
had
a
great
share
in
producing
the
passionate
ardor
with
which
he
pursued
his
studies
he
dreamed
of
raising
himself
so
high
in
public
esteem
by
the
force
of
his
own
industry
that
every
one
would
bow
before
him
but
he
also
vowed
that
he
would
go
away
on
the
first
opportunity
and
that
he
would
not
remain
under
a
roof
where
every
day
he
was
exposed
to
some
secret
humiliation
only
the
good
doctor
must
be
kept
in
ignorance
of
the
cause
of
his
departure
he
must
attribute
it
solely
to
a
passion
for
traveling
and
erik
therefore
frequently
spoke
of
his
desire
when
his
studies
were
completed
of
engaging
in
some
scientific
expedition
while
pursuing
his
studies
at
upsal
he
prepared
himself
by
work
and
the
most
severe
exercise
for
the
life
of
fatigue
and
danger
which
is
the
lot
of
great
travelers
chapter
xi
the
vega
in
the
month
of
december
erik
had
attained
the
age
of
twenty
and
passed
his
first
examination
for
his
doctor
degree
the
learned
men
of
sweden
were
greatly
excited
about
the
proposed
arctic
expedition
of
the
navigator
nordenskiold
and
their
enthusiasm
was
shared
by
a
large
proportion
of
the
population
after
preparing
himself
for
the
undertaking
by
several
voyages
to
the
polar
regions
and
after
studying
the
problem
in
all
its
aspects
nordenskiold
intended
to
attempt
once
more
to
discover
the
passage
from
the
atlantic
to
the
pacific
which
for
three
centuries
had
defied
the
efforts
of
all
the
maritime
nations
the
programme
for
the
expedition
had
been
defined
by
the
swedish
navigator
and
he
announced
the
reasons
which
led
him
to
believe
that
the
passage
was
practicable
in
summer
and
the
means
by
which
he
hoped
to
realize
this
geographical
desideratum
the
intelligent
liberality
of
two
scandinavian
gentlemen
and
the
assistance
of
the
swedish
government
enabled
him
to
organize
his
expedition
upon
a
plan
which
he
believed
would
insure
its
success
it
was
on
the
of
july
that
nordenskiold
quitted
on
board
of
the
vega
to
attempt
to
reach
behring
strait
by
passing
to
the
north
of
russia
and
siberia
lieutenant
palanders
of
the
swedish
navy
was
in
command
of
the
vessel
with
the
instigator
of
the
voyage
and
they
had
also
a
staff
of
botanists
geologists
and
astronomical
doctors
the
vega
which
had
been
especially
prepared
for
the
expedition
under
the
surveillance
of
nordenskiold
was
a
vessel
of
five
hundred
tons
which
had
been
recently
built
at
bremen
and
carried
an
engine
of
power
three
ships
were
to
accompany
her
to
successive
points
on
the
siberian
coast
which
had
been
previously
determined
upon
they
were
all
provisioned
for
a
cruise
of
two
years
in
case
it
might
be
necessary
for
them
to
winter
in
those
arctic
regions
but
nordenskiold
did
not
conceal
his
hope
of
being
able
to
reach
behring
strait
before
autumn
on
account
of
his
careful
arrangements
and
all
sweden
shared
this
hope
they
started
from
the
most
northerly
point
of
norway
and
the
vega
reached
nova
zembla
on
the
of
july
on
the
of
august
the
sea
of
kara
and
on
the
of
august
the
mouth
of
the
gulf
yenisei
on
the
of
august
she
doubled
cape
schelynshin
or
cape
the
extreme
point
of
the
continent
which
no
vessel
had
hitherto
been
able
to
reach
on
the
of
september
she
cast
anchor
at
the
mouth
of
the
lena
and
separated
from
the
third
of
the
vessels
which
had
accompanied
her
thus
far
on
the
of
october
a
telegraphic
dispatch
from
irkutsk
announced
to
the
world
that
the
expedition
had
been
successful
up
to
this
point
we
can
imagine
the
impatience
with
which
the
friends
of
the
swedish
navigator
waited
for
the
details
of
the
expedition
these
details
did
not
reach
them
until
the
of
december
for
if
electricity
flies
over
space
with
the
rapidity
of
thought
it
is
not
the
same
with
the
siberian
post
the
letters
from
the
vega
although
deposited
in
the
at
irkutsk
at
the
same
time
that
the
telegraphic
message
was
dispatched
did
not
reach
sweden
until
six
weeks
afterward
but
they
arrived
at
last
and
on
the
of
december
one
of
the
principal
newspapers
of
sweden
published
an
account
of
the
first
part
of
the
expedition
which
had
been
written
by
a
young
medical
doctor
attached
to
the
vega
that
same
day
at
breakfast
bredejord
was
occupied
in
reading
with
great
interest
the
details
of
the
voyage
given
in
four
columns
when
his
eyes
fell
upon
a
paragraph
which
almost
upset
him
he
it
attentively
and
then
read
it
again
then
he
arose
and
seizing
his
hat
and
coat
he
rushed
to
the
house
of
schwaryencrona
have
you
read
the
correspondence
of
the
he
cried
as
he
rushed
like
a
hurricane
into
the
where
the
doctor
and
kajsa
were
taking
their
breakfast
i
have
just
commenced
it
replied
the
doctor
and
was
intending
to
finish
reading
it
after
breakfast
while
i
smoked
my
pipe
then
you
have
not
seen
exclaimed
bredejord
out
of
breath
you
do
not
know
what
this
correspondence
contains
no
replied
doctor
schwaryencrona
with
perfect
calmness
well
listen
to
this
continued
bredejord
approaching
the
window
it
is
the
journal
of
one
of
your
brethren
the
aid
of
the
naturalist
of
the
and
of
july
we
entered
the
strait
of
jugor
and
cast
anchor
before
a
samoyede
village
called
chabarova
we
landed
and
i
questioned
some
of
the
natives
to
discover
by
holmgren
method
the
extent
of
their
perception
of
colors
i
found
that
this
sense
was
normally
developed
among
them
bought
of
a
samoyede
fisherman
two
magnificent
salmon
pardon
me
interrupted
the
doctor
but
is
this
a
charade
you
are
reading
to
me
i
confess
i
do
not
see
how
these
details
can
interest
me
ah
they
do
not
interest
you
said
bredejord
in
a
triumphant
tone
well
wait
a
moment
and
you
will
see
of
a
samoyede
fisherman
two
magnificent
salmon
which
i
have
preserved
in
alcohol
notwithstanding
the
protestations
of
our
cook
this
fisherman
fell
into
the
water
as
he
was
quitting
the
ship
they
pulled
him
out
half
suffocated
and
stiffened
by
the
cold
so
that
he
resembled
a
bar
of
iron
and
he
also
had
a
serious
cut
on
his
head
we
were
just
under
way
and
they
carried
him
to
the
infirmary
of
the
vega
while
still
unconscious
undressed
him
and
put
him
to
bed
they
then
discovered
that
this
fisherman
was
an
european
he
had
red
hair
his
nose
had
been
broken
by
some
accident
and
on
his
chest
on
a
level
with
his
heart
these
words
were
tattooed
patrick
cynthia
here
schwaryencrona
uttered
a
cry
of
surprise
wait
listen
to
the
rest
of
it
said
bredejord
and
he
continued
his
reading
subjected
to
an
energetic
massage
treatment
he
was
soon
restored
to
life
but
as
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
leave
us
in
that
condition
we
were
compelled
to
take
care
of
him
a
fever
set
in
and
he
became
delirious
our
experiment
of
the
appreciation
of
colors
among
the
samoyedes
therefore
was
of
august
the
fisherman
of
chabarova
has
recovered
from
the
effects
of
his
bath
he
appeared
to
be
surprised
to
find
himself
on
board
the
vega
and
for
cape
tahelyuskin
but
soon
became
reconciled
to
his
fate
his
knowledge
of
the
ganwyede
language
may
be
useful
to
us
and
we
have
determined
to
take
him
with
us
on
the
coast
of
siberia
he
speaks
english
with
a
nasal
accent
like
a
yankee
but
pretends
to
be
scotch
and
calls
himself
tommy
bowles
he
came
from
nova
zembla
with
some
fishermen
and
he
has
lived
on
these
shores
for
the
last
twelve
years
the
name
tattooed
upon
his
chest
he
says
that
of
one
of
the
friends
of
his
infancy
who
has
been
dead
for
a
long
time
it
is
evidently
our
man
cried
the
doctor
with
great
emotion
yes
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
it
answered
the
lawyer
the
name
the
vessel
the
description
all
prove
it
even
this
choice
of
a
pseudonym
johnny
bowles
and
his
declaring
that
patrick
was
dead
these
are
superabundant
proofs
they
were
both
silent
reflecting
upon
the
possible
consequences
of
this
discovery
how
can
we
go
so
far
in
search
of
him
said
the
doctor
at
length
it
will
be
very
difficult
evidently
replied
bredejord
but
it
is
something
to
know
that
he
is
alive
and
the
part
of
the
world
where
he
can
be
found
and
besides
who
can
tell
what
the
future
may
have
in
store
he
may
even
return
to
stockholm
in
the
and
explain
all
that
we
wish
to
find
out
if
he
does
not
do
this
perhaps
we
may
sooner
or
later
find
an
opportunity
to
communicate
with
him
voyages
to
nova
zembla
will
become
more
frequent
on
account
of
this
expedition
of
the
are
already
talking
about
sending
every
year
some
vessels
to
the
mouth
of
the
yenisei
the
discussion
of
this
topic
was
inexhaustible
and
the
two
friends
were
still
talking
about
the
matter
when
erik
arrived
from
upsal
at
two
he
also
had
read
this
great
piece
of
news
and
had
taken
the
train
for
home
without
losing
a
moment
but
it
was
a
singular
fact
that
he
was
not
joyful
but
rather
disturbed
by
this
new
intelligence
do
you
know
what
i
am
afraid
of
said
he
to
the
doctor
and
bredejord
i
fear
that
some
misfortune
has
happened
to
the
you
know
it
is
now
the
of
december
and
you
know
the
leaders
of
the
expedition
counted
upon
arriving
at
behring
strait
before
october
if
this
expectation
had
been
realized
we
should
have
heard
from
her
by
this
time
for
she
would
have
reached
japan
or
at
least
petropaulosk
in
the
aleutian
islands
or
some
station
in
the
pacific
from
which
we
should
have
received
news
of
her
the
dispatches
and
letters
here
came
by
the
way
of
irkutsk
and
are
dated
the
of
september
so
that
for
three
entire
months
we
have
heard
nothing
from
the
so
we
must
conclude
that
they
did
not
reach
behring
strait
as
soon
as
they
expected
and
that
she
has
succumbed
to
the
common
fate
of
all
expeditious
which
for
the
last
three
centuries
have
attempted
to
discover
the
passage
this
is
the
deplorable
conclusion
which
i
have
been
compelled
to
arrive
at
the
might
have
been
obliged
to
encounter
in
the
polar
regions
a
great
deal
which
was
unforeseen
and
she
might
have
been
unprovided
for
such
a
contingency
replied
schwaryencrona
evidently
but
this
is
the
most
favorable
hypothesis
and
a
winter
in
that
region
is
surrounded
by
so
many
dangers
that
it
is
equivalent
to
a
shipwreck
in
any
case
it
is
an
indisputable
fact
that
if
we
ever
have
any
news
of
the
it
will
not
be
possible
to
do
so
before
next
summer
why
how
is
that
because
if
the
has
not
perished
she
is
inclosed
in
the
ice
and
she
will
not
be
able
at
the
best
to
extricate
herself
before
june
or
july
that
is
true
answered
bredejord
what
conclusion
do
you
draw
from
this
reasoning
asked
the
doctor
disturbed
by
the
sad
tone
of
erik
voice
as
he
made
the
announcement
the
conclusion
that
it
is
impossible
to
wait
so
long
before
solving
a
question
which
is
of
such
great
importance
to
me
what
do
you
want
to
do
we
must
submit
to
what
is
inevitable
perhaps
it
only
appears
to
be
so
answered
erik
the
letters
which
have
reached
us
have
come
across
the
arctic
ocean
by
the
way
of
irkutsk
why
could
i
not
follow
the
same
route
i
would
keep
close
to
the
coast
of
siberia
i
would
endeavor
to
communicate
with
the
people
of
that
country
and
find
out
whether
any
foreign
vessel
had
been
shipwrecked
or
was
held
prisoner
among
the
icebergs
perhaps
i
might
succeed
in
finding
nordenskiold
and
patrick
it
is
an
enterprise
worth
undertaking
in
the
middle
of
winter
why
not
it
is
the
most
favorable
season
for
traveling
in
sleighs
in
that
latitude
yes
but
you
forget
that
you
are
not
there
yet
and
that
it
will
be
spring
before
you
could
get
there
that
is
true
said
erik
who
was
compelled
to
recognize
the
force
of
this
argument
he
sat
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
floor
absorbed
in
thought
no
matter
said
he
suddenly
nordenskiold
must
be
found
and
with
him
patrick
they
shall
be
or
it
will
not
be
my
fault
erik
plan
was
a
very
simple
one
he
proposed
to
write
an
anonymous
letter
to
the
leading
newspapers
of
stockholm
and
thus
proclaim
his
fears
as
to
the
fate
of
the
vega
had
she
been
shipwrecked
or
was
she
held
a
prisoner
by
icebergs
and
he
concluded
his
communication
by
representing
how
important
it
was
that
some
vessel
should
be
sent
to
her
assistance
in
the
latter
case
the
truth
of
his
reasoning
was
so
apparent
and
the
interest
in
the
expedition
so
general
that
the
young
student
of
upsal
was
certain
that
the
question
would
be
warmly
discussed
in
scientific
circles
but
the
effect
of
his
letter
was
beyond
his
highest
expectations
all
the
newspapers
without
exception
expressed
their
approval
of
his
proposition
while
commenting
upon
his
communication
public
opinion
was
unanimously
in
favor
of
fitting
out
a
relief
expedition
commercial
men
manufacturers
the
members
of
schools
and
colleges
the
judicial
corps
in
fact
all
classes
voluntarily
contributed
to
the
enterprise
a
rich
offered
to
equip
a
vessel
at
his
own
expense
to
go
to
the
relief
of
the
vega
and
he
named
it
the
nordenskiold
the
enthusiasm
increased
as
days
passed
without
bringing
any
intelligence
of
the
vega
by
the
end
of
december
the
subscription
had
reached
a
considerable
sum
sehwaryencrona
and
bredejord
had
headed
the
list
with
a
subscription
of
ten
thousand
kroners
each
they
were
members
of
the
committee
who
had
chosen
erik
for
their
secretary
the
latter
was
in
fact
the
soul
of
the
undertaking
his
ardor
his
modesty
his
evident
ability
with
regard
to
all
questions
relative
to
the
expedition
which
he
studied
untiringly
soon
acquired
for
him
a
most
decided
influence
from
the
first
he
did
not
conceal
the
fact
that
it
was
his
dream
to
take
part
in
the
enterprise
if
only
as
a
simple
sailor
and
that
he
had
a
supreme
and
personal
interest
in
the
matter
this
only
gave
the
greater
weight
to
the
excellent
suggestions
which
he
made
to
the
originators
of
the
expedition
and
he
personally
directed
all
the
preparatory
labors
it
was
agreed
that
a
second
vessel
should
accompany
the
nordenskiold
and
that
it
should
be
like
the
vega
a
steamship
nordenskiold
himself
had
demonstrated
that
the
principal
cause
of
the
failure
of
previous
attempts
had
been
the
employment
of
sailing
vessels
arctic
navigators
especially
when
on
an
exploring
expedition
must
not
be
dependent
upon
the
wind
but
must
be
able
to
force
their
way
speedily
through
a
difficult
or
perilous
pass
and
above
all
always
be
able
to
take
the
open
sea
which
it
was
often
impossible
to
do
with
a
sailing
vessel
this
fundamental
point
having
been
established
it
was
decided
also
to
cover
the
vessel
with
a
lining
of
green
oak
six
inches
thick
and
to
divide
it
into
compartments
so
that
it
would
be
better
able
to
resist
a
blow
from
the
ice
they
were
also
desirous
that
she
should
not
draw
too
much
water
and
that
all
her
arrangements
should
be
so
made
as
to
enable
her
to
carry
a
full
supply
of
coal
among
the
offers
which
were
made
to
the
committee
was
a
vessel
of
one
hundred
and
forty
tons
which
had
been
recently
built
at
bremen
and
which
had
a
crew
of
eighteen
men
who
could
easily
maneuver
her
she
was
a
schooner
but
while
she
carried
her
masts
she
also
was
furnished
with
an
engine
of
eighty
one
of
her
boilers
was
so
arranged
that
it
could
burn
oil
or
fat
which
was
easily
procurable
in
the
arctic
regions
in
case
their
coal
should
fail
the
schooner
protected
by
its
lining
of
oak
was
further
strengthened
by
transverse
beams
so
as
to
offer
the
greatest
possible
resistance
to
the
pressure
of
the
ice
lastly
the
front
of
it
was
armed
with
a
spur
of
steel
to
enable
it
to
break
its
way
through
a
thick
field
of
ice
the
vessel
when
placed
on
the
stocks
was
named
the
alaska
on
account
of
the
direction
which
she
was
destined
to
take
it
had
been
decided
that
while
the
nordenskiold
should
pursue
the
same
route
which
the
vega
had
followed
that
the
second
vessel
should
take
an
opposite
direction
around
the
world
and
gain
the
siberian
ocean
by
the
island
of
alaska
and
behring
straits
the
chances
of
meeting
the
swedish
expedition
or
of
discovering
traces
of
her
if
she
had
perished
would
thus
they
thought
be
double
for
while
one
vessel
followed
on
her
track
the
other
would
as
it
were
precede
her
erik
who
had
been
the
originator
of
this
plan
had
often
asked
himself
which
of
the
vessels
he
had
better
join
and
he
had
finally
concluded
to
attach
himself
to
the
second
the
nordenskiold
he
said
to
himself
would
follow
the
same
course
as
the
vega
it
was
therefore
necessary
that
she
should
be
equally
successful
in
making
the
first
part
of
the
voyage
and
double
cape
tchelynskin
but
they
might
not
be
able
to
do
this
since
it
had
only
been
accomplished
once
besides
the
last
news
which
they
had
received
from
the
vega
she
was
only
two
or
three
hundred
leagues
from
behring
straits
therefore
they
would
have
a
better
chance
of
meeting
her
the
nordenskiold
might
follow
her
for
many
months
without
overtaking
her
but
the
other
vessel
could
hardly
fail
to
meet
her
if
she
was
still
in
existence
the
principal
thing
in
erik
eyes
was
to
reach
the
vega
as
quickly
as
possible
in
order
to
meet
patrick
without
delay
the
doctor
and
bredejord
warmly
approved
of
his
motives
when
he
explained
them
to
them
the
work
of
preparing
the
alaska
was
pushed
on
as
rapidly
as
possible
her
provisions
equipments
and
the
clothing
were
all
carefully
chosen
for
they
profited
by
the
experience
of
former
arctic
explorers
her
crew
were
all
experienced
seamen
who
had
been
inured
to
cold
by
frequent
fishing
voyages
to
iceland
and
greenland
lastly
the
captain
chosen
by
the
committee
was
an
officer
of
the
swedish
marines
then
in
the
employment
of
a
maritime
company
and
well
known
on
account
of
his
voyages
to
the
arctic
ocean
his
name
was
lieutenant
marsilas
he
chose
for
his
first
lieutenant
erik
himself
who
seemed
designed
for
the
position
by
the
energy
he
had
displayed
in
the
service
of
the
expedition
and
who
was
also
qualified
by
his
diploma
the
second
and
third
officers

the
alaska
carried
some
explosive
material
in
order
to
break
the
ice
if
it
should
be
necessary
and
abundant
provisions
of
an
character
in
order
to
preserve
the
officers
and
crew
from
the
common
arctic
maladies
the
vessel
was
furnished
with
a
heater
in
order
to
preserve
an
even
temperature
and
also
with
a
portable
observatory
called
a
raven
nest
which
they
could
hoist
to
the
top
of
the
highest
mast
in
those
regions
where
they
meet
with
floating
ice
to
signal
the
approach

by

proposal
this
observatory
contained
a
powerful
electric
light
which
at
night
could
illuminate
the
route
of
the
alaska
seven
small
boats
of
which
two
were

six
sledges
for

of
the
crew
four
gatling
cannons
and
thirty
guns
with
the
necessary
ammunition
were
stored
away
on

these
preparations
were
approaching
an
end
when
hersebom
and
his
son
otto
arrived
from
noroe
with
their
large
dog
kaas
and
solicited
the
favor
of
being
employed
as
seamen
on
board
of
the
alaska
they
knew
from
a
letter
of
erik
the
strong
personal
interest
which
he
had
in
this
voyage
and
they
wished
to
share
its
dangers
with
him
hersebom
spoke
of
the
value
of
his
experience
as
a
fisherman
on
the
coast
of
greenland
and
of
the
usefulness
of
his
dog
kaas
who
could
be
used
as
a
leader
of
the
dogs
which
would
be
necessary
to
draw
the
sledges
otto
had
only
his
good
health
his
herculean
strength
and
his
devotion
to
the
cause
to
recommend
him
thanks
to
the
influence
of
the
doctor
and
bredejord
they
were
all
three
engaged
by
the
committee
by
the
beginning
of
february
all
was
ready
the
alaska
had
therefore
five
months
before
the
first
of
june
to
reach
straits
which
was
accounted
the
most
favorable
season
for
the
exploration
they
intended
also
to
take
the
most
direct
route
that
is
to
say
through
the
mediterranean
the
suez
canal
the
indian
ocean
and
the
china
seas
stopping
successively
to
take
in
coal
at
gibraltar
aden
colombo
in
ceylon
singapore
hong
kong
yokohama
and
petropaulosk
from
all
these
stations
the
alaska
was
to
telegraph
to
stockholm
and
it
was
also
agreed
that
if
in
the
meantime
any
news
was
received
of
the
vega
they
should
not
fail
to
send
information
the
voyage
of
the
alaska
although
intended
primarily
for
an
arctic
exploration
would
begin
by
a
voyage
through
tropical
seas
and
along
the
continents
most
favored
by
the
sun
the
programme
had
not
however
been
arranged
to
give
them
pleasure
it
was
the
result
of
an
imperative
necessity
since
they
must
reach
behring
straits
by
the
shortest
route
and
remain
in
telegraphic
communication
with
stockholm
up
to
the
last
moment
but
a
serious
difficulty
threatened
to
retard
the
expedition
they
had
spent
so
much
in
equipping
the
vessel
that
the
funds
which
were
indispensable
for
the
success
of
the
enterprise
began
to
run
short
they
would
require
considerable
to
purchase
coal
and
for
other
incidental
expenses
a
new
appeal
for
money
became
necessary
as
soon
as
it
was
issued
the
committee
received
two
letters
simultaneously
one
was
from
malarius
the
public
teacher
of
noroe
and
laureate
of
the
botanical
society
it
contained
a
check
for
one
hundred
kroners
and
begged
that
he
might
be
attached
to
the
expedition
as
the
assistant
naturalist
of
the
alaska
the
other
contained
a
check
for
thousand
kroners
with
this
laconic
note
for
the
voyage
of
the
from
tudor
brown
on
condition
that
he
is
received
as
a
passenger
chapter
xii
unexpected
passengers
the
request
of
malarius
could
only
be
received
with
gratitude
by
the
committee
it
was
therefore
passed
enthusiastically
and
the
worthy
teacher
whose
reputation
as
a
botanist
was
greater
than
he
himself
suspected
was
appointed
assistant
naturalist
of
the
expedition
as
for
the
condition
upon
which
tudor
brown
bestowed
his
donation
of
thousand
kroners
both
schwaryencrona
and
bredejord
were
strongly
inclined
to
refuse
to
grant
it
but
if
called
upon
to
give
some
motive
for
their
repugnance
they
had
to
confess
that
they
would
not
know
what
to
say
what
sufficient
reason
could
they
give
the
committee
if
they
asked
them
to
refuse
such
a
large
subscription
they
really
had
no
valid
one
tudor
brown
had
called
upon
schwaryencrona
and
brought
him
a
certified
account
of
the
death
of
patrick
and
now
patrick
appeared
to
be
living
but
they
could
not
prove
that
tudor
brown
had
willfully
deceived
them
in
this
matter
and
the
committee
would
require
some
sufficient
cause
before
rejecting
so
large
a
sum
tudor
brown
could
easily
declare
that
he
had
been
truthful
his
present
attitude
seemed
to
prove
it
perhaps
he
intended
to
go
himself
only
to
find
out
how
patrick
whom
he
believed
to
have
been
drowned
in
the
straits
of
madeira
could
now
be
living
on
the
shores
of
siberia
but
even
supposing
that
tudor
brown
had
other
projects
it
would
be
to
their
interest
to
find
them
out
and
keep
him
in
their
hands
for
one
of
two
facts
was
certain
either
tudor
brown
had
no
interest
in
the
search
which
had
occupied
erik
friends
for
so
long
a
time
and
in
that
case
it
would
be
useless
to
treat
him
as
an
enemy
or
he
had
some
slight
personal
interest
in
the
matter
and
then
it
would
be
better
to
watch
his
plans
and
overthrow
them
the
doctor
and
bredejord
therefore
concluded
that
they
would
not
oppose
his
becoming
a
passenger
then
they
gradually
were
filled
with
a
desire
to
study
this
singular
man
and
find
out
why
he
wished
to
take
passage
on
the
alaska
but
how
could
they
do
this
without
sailing
with
him
it
would
not
be
such
an
absurd
thing
to
do
after
all
the
course
which
the
alaska
was
to
take
was
a
very
attractive
one
at
least
the
first
part
of
it
to
be
brief
schwaryencrona
who
was
a
great
traveler
asked
to
be
taken
as
a
passenger
to
accompany
the
expedition
as
far
as
the
china
seas
by
paying
such
a
price
as
the
committee
might
judge
proper
this
example
immediately
acted
with
irresistible
force
upon
bredejord
who
had
dreamed
for
a
long
time
about
an
excursion
to
the
land
of
the
sun
he
also
solicited
a
cabin
under
the
same
conditions
every
one
in
stockholm
now
believed
that
hochstedt
would
do
the
same
partly
out
of
scientific
curiosity
and
partly
from
terror
at
the
thought
of
passing
so
many
months
without
the
society
of
his
friends
but
all
stockholm
was
deceived
the
professor
was
strongly
tempted
to
go
and
he
reviewed
all
the
arguments
for
and
against
it
and
found
it
almost
impossible
to
arrive
at
any
decision
but
fate
ordained
that
he
should
stay
at
home
the
time
of
their
departure
was
irrevocably
fixed
for
the
of
february
on
the
erik
went
to
meet
malarius
and
was
agreeably
surprised
to
see
dame
hersebom
and
vanda
who
had
come
to
bid
him
farewell
they
were
modestly
intending
to
go
to
a
hotel
in
the
town
but
the
doctor
insisted
that
they
should
come
and
stay
with
him
to
the
great
displeasure
of
kajsa
who
did
not
think
that
they
were
sufficiently
distinguished
vanda
was
now
a
tall
girl
whose
beauty
fulfilled
its
early
promise
she
had
passed
successfully
a
very
difficult
examination
at
bergen
which
entitled
her
to
take
a
professor
chair
in
a
superior
school
but
she
preferred
to
remain
at
noroe
with
her
mother
and
she
was
going
to
fill
malarius
place
during
his
absence
always
serious
and
gentle
she
found
in
teaching
a
strange
and
inexplicable
charm
but
it
had
not
changed
the
simplicity
of
her
home
life
this
beautiful
girl
in
her
quaint
norwegian
costume
was
able
to
give
tranquilly
her
opinion
on
the
deepest
scientific
subjects
or
seat
herself
at
the
piano
and
play
with
consummate
skill
a
sonata
of
beethoven
but
her
greatest
charm
was
the
absence
of
all
pretension
and
her
perfectly
natural
manners
she
no
more
thought
of
being
vain
of
her
talents
or
of
making
any
display
of
them
than
she
did
of
blushing
on
account
of
her
rural
costume
she
bloomed
like
some
wild
flower
that
growing
beside
the
fiord
had
been
transplanted
by
her
old
master
and
cultivated
and
cherished
in
his
little
garden
behind
the
school
in
the
evening
all
erik
adopted
family
were
assembled
in
the
parlor
of
schwaryencrona
bredejord
and
the
doctor
were
about
to
play
a
last
game
of
whist
with
hochstedt
they
discovered
that
malarius
was
also
an
authority
in
this
noble
game
which
would
enable
them
to
while
away
many
leisure
hours
on
board
the
alaska
unfortunately
the
worthy
instructor
also
told
them
at
the
same
time
that
he
was
always
a
victim
of
and
nearly
always
confined
to
his
bed
as
soon
as
he
set
foot
upon
a
vessel
only
his
affection
for
erik
had
induced
him
to
join
the
expedition
added
to
the
ambition
long
fondly
cherished
of
being
able
to
add
some
more
varieties
to
his
catalogue
of
botanical
families
after
which
they
had
a
little
music
kajsa
with
a
disdainful
air
played
a
fashionable
waltz
vanda
sung
an
old
scandinavian
melody
with
a
sweetness
that
surprised
them
all
the
tea
was
served
and
a
large
bowl
of
punch
which
they
drunk
to
the
success
of
the
expedition
followed
erik
noticed
that
kajsa
avoided
touching
his
glass
will
you
not
wish
me
a
happy
voyage
he
said
to
her
in
a
low
tone
what
is
the
use
of
wishing
for
what
we
do
not
expect
to
see
granted
she
answered
the
next
morning
at
every
one
went
on
board
except
tudor
brown
since
the
receipt
of
his
letter
containing
the
check
they
had
not
heard
a
word
from
him
the
time
of
departure
had
been
fixed
for
ten
at
the
first
stroke
the
commander
marsilas
had
the
anchor
hoisted
and
rang
the
bell
to
warn
all
visitors
to
leave
the
ship
adieu
erik
cried
vanda
throwing
her
arms
around
his
neck
adieu
my
son
said
katrina
pressing
the
young
lieutenant
to
her
heart
and
you
kajsa
have
you
nothing
to
say
to
me
he
asked
as
he
walked
toward
her
as
if
to
embrace
her
also
i
hope
that
you
will
not
get
your
nose
frozen
and
that
you
will
discover
that
you
are
a
prince
in
disguise
said
she
laughing
impertinently
if
that
should
happen
then
at
least
i
might
hope
to
win
a
little
of
your
affection
he
said
trying
to
smile
to
hide
his
feelings
for
her
sarcasm
had
cut
him
to
the
heart
do
you
doubt
it
answered
kajsa
as
she
turned
toward
her
uncle
to
show
that
her
adieu
to
him
was
finished
the
time
of
departure
had
indeed
come
the
warning
bell
rang
imperiously
the
crowd
of
visitors
descended
the
stairs
to
the
boats
which
were
waiting
for
them
in
the
midst
of
this
confusion
every
one
noticed
the
arrival
of
a
tardy
passenger
who
mounted
to
the
deck
with
his
valise
in
his
hand
the
tardy
one
was
tudor
brown
he
presented
himself
to
the
captain
and
claimed
his
cabin
to
which
he
was
immediately
shown
a
moment
later
after
two
or
three
prolonged
whistles
the
engine
began
to
work
and
a
sea
of
foam
whitening
the
waters
behind
her
the
alaska
glided
majestically
over
the
green
waters
of
the
baltic
and
soon
left
stockholm
behind
her
followed
by
the
acclamations
of
the
crowd
who
were
waving
their
hats
and
handkerchiefs
erik
on
the
bridge
directed
the
maneuvers
of
the
vessel
while
bredejord
and
the
doctor
waved
a
last
farewell
to
vanda
from
the
deck
malarius
already
frightfully
seasick
had
retired
to
his
bed
they
were
all
so
occupied
with
saying
farewell
that
not
one
of
them
had
noticed
the
arrival
of
tudor
brown
therefore
the
doctor
could
not
repress
a
start
of
surprise
when
as
he
turned
around
he
saw
him
ascending
from
the
depths
of
the
vessel
and
marching
straight
toward
him
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
clothed
as
he
had
been
at
their
first
interview
and
with
his
hat
always
seemingly
glued
to
his
head
fine
weather
said
tudor
brown
by
way
of
salutation
and
introduction
the
doctor
was
stupefied
by
his
effrontery
he
waited
for
some
moments
to
see
if
this
strange
man
would
make
any
excuse
or
give
any
explanation
of
his
conduct
seeing
that
he
did
not
intend
to
say
anything
he
opened
the
subject
himself
well
sir
it
appears
that
patrick
is
not
dead
as
we
supposed
he
said
with
his
customary
vivacity
that
is
precisely
what
i
want
to
find
out
and
it
is
on
that
account
i
have
undertaken
this
voyage
after
saying
this
tudor
brown
turned
away
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
deck
whistling
his
favorite
air
appearing
to
think
that
his
explanation
was
perfectly
satisfactory
erik
and
bredejord
listened
to
this
conversation
with
a
natural
curiosity
they
had
never
seen
tudor
brown
before
and
they
studied
him
attentively
even
more
so
than
schwaryencrona
it
seemed
to
them
that
the
man
although
he
affected
indifference
cast
a
furtive
glance
at
them
from
time
to
time
to
see
what
impression
he
made
upon
them
perceiving
this
they
also
immediately
feigned
to
take
no
notice
of
him
and
did
not
address
a
word
to
him
but
as
soon
as
they
descended
to
the
saloon
upon
which
their
cabins
opened
they
took
counsel
together
what
could
have
been
tudor
brown
motive
in
trying
to
make
them
believe
that
patrick
was
dead
and
what
was
his
purpose
in
taking
this
voyage
upon
the
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
say
but
it
was
difficult
not
to
believe
that
it
had
some
connection
with
the
shipwreck
of
the
and
the
infant
tied
to
the
buoy
the
only
interest
which
patrick
had
for
erik
and
his
friends
was
the
fact
of
his
supposed
knowledge
of
the
affair
and
this
was
their
only
reason
for
seeking
for
him
now
they
had
before
them
a
man
who
was
uninvited
and
who
had
come
to
them
and
declared
that
patrick
was
dead
and
this
man
had
forced
his
society
upon
the
members
of
the
expedition
as
soon
as
his
assertion
in
the
most
unexpected
manner
had
been
proved
to
be
false
they
were
therefore
obliged
to
conclude
that
he
had
some
personal
interest
in
the
matter
and
the
fact
of
his
seeking
out
doctor
schwaryencrona
indicated
the
connection
between
his
interests
and
the
inquiries
instituted
by
the
doctor
all
these
facts
therefore
seemed
to
indicate
that
tudor
brown
was
in
this
problem
a
factor
quite
as
important
as
patrick
himself
who
could
tell
whether
he
was
not
already
in
possession
of
the
secret
which
they
were
trying
to
elucidate
if
this
was
the
case
was
it
a
happy
thing
for
them
that
they
had
him
on
board
or
should
they
rather
be
disturbed
by
his
presence
bredejord
inclined
to
the
latter
opinion
and
did
not
consider
his
appearance
among
them
as
at
all
reassuring
the
doctor
on
the
other
side
argued
that
tudor
brown
might
have
acted
in
good
faith
and
also
that
he
might
be
honest
at
heart
notwithstanding
his
unattractive
exterior
if
he
knows
anything
said
he
we
can
hope
that
the
familiarity
which
a
long
voyage
necessarily
produces
may
induce
him
to
speak
out
in
that
case
it
would
be
a
stroke
of
good
luck
to
have
had
him
with
us
at
least
we
shall
see
what
he
can
have
to
do
with
if
we
ever
find
the
irishman
as
for
erik
he
did
not
even
dare
to
express
the
sentiments
which
the
sight
of
this
man
awakened
in
him
it
was
more
than
repulsion
it
was
positive
hatred
and
an
instinctive
desire
to
rush
upon
him
and
throw
him
into
the
sea
he
was
convinced
that
this
man
had
had
some
share
in
the
misfortune
of
his
life
but
he
would
have
blushed
to
abandon
himself
to
such
a
conviction
or
even
to
speak
of
it
he
contented
himself
with
saying
that
he
would
never
have
allowed
tudor
brown
to
come
on
board
if
he
had
had
any
voice
in
the
matter
how
should
they
treat
him
on
this
point
also
they
were
divided
the
doctor
declared
that
it
would
be
politic
to
treat
tudor
brown
with
at
least
outward
courtesy
in
the
hope
of
inducing
him
to
speak
out
bredejord
as
well
as
erik
felt
a
great
repugnance
to
act
out
such
a
comedy
and
it
was
by
no
means
certain
that
schwaryencrona
himself
would
be
able
to
conform
to
his
own
programme
they
determined
to
leave
the
matter
to
be
decided
by
circumstances
and
the
behavior
of
tudor
brown
himself
they
did
not
have
to
wait
long
precisely
at
midday
the
bell
rang
for
dinner
bredejord
and
the
doctor
went
to
the
table
of
the
commander
there
they
found
tudor
brown
already
seated
with
his
hat
on
his
head
and
he
did
not
manifest
the
least
inclination
to
enter
into
any
relations
with
his
neighbors
the
man
proved
to
be
so
rude
and
coarse
that
he
disarmed
indignation
he
seemed
to
be
ignorant
of
the
simplest
rules
of
politeness
he
helped
himself
first
chose
the
best
portions
and
ate
and
drank
like
an
ogre
two
or
three
times
the
commander
and
schwaryencrona
addressed
a
few
words
to
him
he
did
not
even
deign
to
speak
but
answered
them
by
gestures
that
did
not
prevent
him
however
when
he
had
finished
his
repast
and
armed
himself
with
an
enormous
from
throwing
himself
back
in
his
seat
and
saying
to
marsilas
what
day
shall
we
reach
gibraltar
about
the
nineteenth
or
twentieth
i
think
answered
the
captain
tudor
brown
drew
a
book
from
his
pocket
and
examined
his
calendar
that
will
bring
us
to
malta
on
the
to
alexandria
on
the
and
to
aden
at
the
end
of
the
month
said
he
as
if
speaking
to
himself
then
he
got
up
and
going
on
deck
again
began
to
pace
up
and
down
a
pleasant
traveling
companion
truly
marsilas
could
not
help
saying
bredejord
was
about
to
answer
when
a
frightful
noise
at
the
head
of
the
staircase
prevented
him
they
heard
cries
and
barking
and
a
confusion
of
voices
everybody
arose
and
ran
on
deck
the
tumult
had
been
caused
by
kaas
hersebom
greenland
dog
it
seemed
that
he
did
not
approve
of
tudor
brown
for
after
evincing
his
displeasure
by
low
growls
every
time
he
passed
and
repassed
him
he
finished
by
seizing
him
by
the
legs
tudor
brown
had
drawn
his
revolver
from
his
pocket
and
was
about
to
use
it
when
otto
appeared
on
the
scene
and
prevented
him
from
doing
so
and
then
sent
kaas
away
to
his
kennel
a
stormy
discussion
then
took
place
tudor
brown
white
with
rage
and
terror
insisted
that
the
dog
brains
should
be
blown
out
hersebom
who
had
come
to
the
rescue
protested
warmly
against
such
a
project
the
commander
arriving
at
this
moment
settled
the
matter
by
desiring
tudor
brown
to
put
away
his
revolver
and
decreeing
that
henceforth
kaas
must
be
kept
chained
this
ridiculous
incident
was
the
only
one
that
varied
the
monotony
of
their
first
days
of
voyaging
every
one
became
accustomed
to
the
silence
and
strange
manners
of
tudor
brown
at
the
captain
table
they
at
length
took
no
more
notice
of
him
than
if
he
had
not
been
in
existence
everybody
pursued
their
own
avocations
malarius
after
passing
two
days
in
bed
was
able
to
crawl
upon
deck
he
commenced
to
eat
and
was
soon
able
to
take
his
place
at
the
innumerable
whist
parties
of
the
doctor
and
bredejord
erik
very
much
occupied
with
his
business
as
lieutenant
spent
every
spare
moment
in
reading
on
the
eleventh
they
passed
the
island
of
oland
on
the
thirteenth
they
reached
shayer
rock
passed
through
the
sound
signaled
heligoland
on
the
fourteenth
and
on
the
sixteenth
they
doubled
cape
hogue
on
the
following
night
erik
was
sleeping
in
his
cabin
when
he
was
awakened
by
a
sudden
silence
and
perceived
that
he
no
longer
felt
the
vibrations
of
the
engine
he
was
not
however
alarmed
for
he
knew
that
kjellguist
was
in
charge
of
the
vessel
but
out
of
curiosity
he
arose
and
went
on
deck
to
see
what
had
happened
he
was
told
by
the
chief
engineer
that
the
engine
had
broken
down
and
that
they
would
be
compelled
to
extinguish
the
fires
they
could
proceed
however
under
sail
with
alight
breeze
from
the
a
careful
inspection
threw
no
light
on
the
cause
of
the
damage
and
the
engineer
asked
permission
to
repair
to
the
nearest
port
to
repair
the
injury
commander
marsilas
after
a
personal
examination
was
of
the
same
opinion
they
found
that
they
were
thirty
miles
from
brest
and
the
order
was
given
to
steer
for
the
great
french
port
chapter
xiii
the
shipwreck
the
next
day
the
alaska
entered
the
harbor
of
brest
the
damage
which
she
had
sustained
was
fortunately
not
important
an
engineer
who
was
applied
to
immediately
promised
that
her
injuries
should
be
repaired
in
three
days
it
was
therefore
not
a
very
serious
delay
and
they
could
make
up
for
it
in
a
measure
by
taking
in
coal
they
would
therefore
not
be
obliged
to
stop
at
gibraltar
for
this
purpose
as
they
had
at
first
intended
their
next
was
to
be
at
malta
which
they
hoped
to
reach
hours
earlier
than
they
had
at
first
expected
and
thus
would
reduce
the
time
of
their
delay
in
reality
to
two
days
they
therefore
had
nothing
to
worry
themselves
about
and
everyone
felt
disposed
to
view
the
accident
in
the
most
philosophical
manner
it
soon
became
evident
that
their
mischance
was
going
to
be
turned
into
a
festival
in
a
few
hours
the
arrival
of
the
alaska
became
known
through
the
town
and
as
the
newspapers
made
known
the
object
of
the
expedition
the
commander
of
the
swedish
vessel
soon
found
himself
the
recipient
of
the
most
flattering
attentions
the
admiral
and
mayor
of
brest
the
commander
of
the
port
and
the
captains
of
the
vessels
which
were
lying
at
anchor
all
came
to
pay
an
official
visit
to
captain
marsilas
a
dinner
and
a
ball
were
tendered
to
the
hardy
explorers
who
were
to
take
part
in
the
search
for
the
nordenskiold
although
the
doctor
and
malarius
cared
little
for
such
gatherings
they
were
obliged
to
take
their
places
at
the
table
which
was
prepared
for
them
as
for
bredejord
he
was
in
his
true
element
among
the
friends
invited
by
the
admiral
was
a
old
man
with
a
refined
but
sad
countenance
he
soon
attracted
erik
attention
who
felt
a
sympathy
for
him
which
he
could
hardly
explain
it
was
durrien
honorary
and
an
active
member
of
the
geographical
society
who
was
well
known
on
account
of
his
travels
and
researches
in
asia
minor
and
the
soudan
erik
had
read
his
works
with
very
great
interest
and
he
mentioned
that
he
had
done
so
when
he
had
been
presented
to
the
french
who
experienced
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
as
he
listened
to
the
enthusiastic
young
man
it
is
often
the
fate
of
travelers
when
their
adventures
make
a
stir
in
the
world
to
receive
the
loud
admiration
of
the
crowd
but
to
find
that
their
labors
are
appreciated
by
those
who
are
well
informed
and
capable
of
judging
does
not
occur
so
frequently
therefore
the
respectful
curiosity
of
erik
went
straight
to
the
heart
of
the
old
geographer
and
brought
a
smile
to
his
pale
lips
i
have
never
attached
any
great
merit
to
my
discoveries
he
said
in
reply
to
a
few
words
from
erik
regarding
the
fortunate
excavations
which
had
recently
been
made
i
went
ahead
seeking
to
forget
my
own
cruel
misfortunes
and
not
caring
so
much
for
the
results
as
i
did
for
prosecuting
a
work
which
was
in
entire
accordance
with
my
tastes
chance
has
done
the
rest
seeing
erik
and
durrien
so
friendly
the
admiral
took
care
to
seat
them
together
at
table
so
that
they
could
continue
their
conversation
during
dinner
as
they
were
taking
their
coffee
the
young
lieutenant
of
the
alaska
was
accosted
by
a
little
man
who
had
been
introduced
to
him
as
kergaridec
who
asked
him
without
any
preamble
to
what
country
he
belonged
a
little
surprised
at
first
by
the
question
erik
answered
that
he
was
from
sweden
or
to
be
more
exact
from
norway
and
that
his
family
lived
in
the
province
of
bergen
then
he
inquired
his
motive
for
asking
the
question
my
motive
is
a
very
simple
one
answered
his
interlocutor
for
an
hour
i
have
been
studying
your
face
across
the
table
while
we
were
at
dinner
and
i
have
never
seen
anywhere
such
a
perfect
type
of
the
celt
as
i
behold
in
you
i
must
tell
you
that
i
am
devoted
to
celtic
studies
and
it
is
the
first
time
that
i
have
met
with
this
type
among
the
scandinavians
perhaps
this
is
a
precious
indication
for
science
and
we
may
be
able
to
place
norway
among
the
regions
visited
by
our
gaelic
ancestors
erik
was
about
to
explain
to
the
worthy
the
reasons
which
would
invalidate
this
hypothesis
when
kergaridec
turned
away
to
pay
his
respects
to
a
lady
who
had
just
entered
the
room
and
their
conversation
was
not
resumed
the
young
lieutenant
of
the
alaska
would
probably
never
have
thought
of
this
incident
again
but
the
next
day
as
they
were
passing
through
a
street
near
the
market
schwaryencrona
said
suddenly
to
him
my
dear
child
if
i
have
ever
had
a
doubt
as
to
your
celtic
origin
i
should
have
lost
it
here
see
how
you
resemble
these
bretons
they
have
the
same
brown
eyes
black
hair
bony
neck
colored
skin
and
general
appearance
bredejord
may
say
what
he
likes
but
you
are
a
celt
you
may
depend
upon
it
erik
then
told
him
what
old
kergaridec
had
said
to
him
and
schwaryencrona
was
so
delighted
that
he
could
not
talk
of
anything
else
all
the
day
with
the
other
passengers
of
the
alaska
tudor
brown
had
received
and
accepted
an
invitation
from
the
prefect
they
thought
up
to
the
last
moment
that
he
would
go
in
his
accustomed
dress
for
he
had
made
his
appearance
in
it
just
as
they
were
all
going
ashore
to
the
dinner
but
doubtless
the
necessity
of
removing
his
precious
hat
appeared
too
hard
to
him
for
they
saw
him
no
more
that
evening
when
he
returned
after
the
ball
erik
learned
from
hersebom
that
tudor
brown
had
returned
at
seven
and
dined
alone
after
that
he
had
entered
the
captain
room
to
consult
a
marine
chart
then
he
had
returned
to
the
town
in
the
same
small
boat
which
had
brought
him
on
board
this
was
the
last
news
which
they
received
of
him
the
next
evening
at
five
tudor
brown
had
not
made
his
appearance
he
knew
however
that
the
machinery
of
the
alaska
would
be
repaired
by
that
time
and
her
fires
kindled
after
which
it
would
be
impossible
to
defer
her
departure
the
captain
had
been
careful
to
notify
every
one
he
gave
the
order
to
hoist
the
anchor
the
vessel
had
been
loosened
from
her
moorings
when
a
small
boat
was
signaled
making
all
speed
toward
them
every
one
believed
that
it
carried
tudor
brown
but
they
soon
saw
that
it
was
only
a
letter
which
had
been
sent
on
board
it
occasion
general
surprise
when
it
was
discovered
that
this
letter
was
directed
to
erik
when
he
opened
it
erik
found
that
it
simply
contained
the
card
of
durrien
the
honorary
and
member
of
the
geographical
society
with
these
words
written
in
pencil
a
good
voyage
a
speedy
return
we
can
not
explain
erik
feelings
this
attention
from
an
amiable
and
distinguished
brought
tears
to
his
eyes
in
leaving
this
hospitable
shore
where
he
had
remained
three
days
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
was
leaving
his
own
country
he
placed
durrien
card
in
his
memorandum
book
and
said
to
himself
that
this
adieu
from
an
old
man
could
not
fail
to
bring
him
good
luck
it
was
now
the
of
february
the
weather
was
fine
the
sun
had
sunk
below
the
horizon
leaving
a
sky
as
cloudless
as
that
of
summer
erik
had
the
watch
during
the
first
quarter
and
he
walked
the
with
a
light
step
it
seemed
to
him
that
with
the
departure
of
tudor
brown
the
evil
genius
of
the
expedition
had
disappeared
provided
that
he
does
not
intend
to
rejoin
us
at
malta
or
suez
he
said
to
himself
it
was
possible
indeed
even
probable
if
tudor
brown
wished
to
spare
himself
the
long
voyage
which
the
alaska
would
make
before
reaching
egypt
while
the
vessel
was
going
around
the
coasts
of
france
and
spain
he
could
if
it
so
pleased
him
stay
for
a
week
in
paris
or
at
any
other
place
and
then
take
the
mail
packet
either
to
alexandria
or
suez
and
rejoin
the
alaska
at
either
of
those
places
or
he
could
even
defer
doing
so
until
they
reached
singapore
or
yokohama
but
this
was
only
a
possibility
the
fact
was
that
he
was
no
longer
on
board
and
that
he
could
not
cast
a
damper
upon
the
spirits
of
the
company
their
dinner
also
which
they
took
at
six
as
usual
was
the
gayest
which
they
had
yet
sat
down
to
at
dessert
they
drank
to
the
success
of
the
expedition
and
every
one
in
his
heart
associated
it
more
or
less
with
the
absence
of
tudor
brown
then
they
went
on
deck
and
smoked
their
cigars
it
was
a
dark
night
but
in
the
distance
toward
the
north
they
could
see
the
light
of
cape
saint
matthew
they
soon
signaled
also
the
little
light
on
the
shore
at
which
proved
that
they
were
in
their
right
course
a
good
breeze
from
the
accelerated
the
speed
of
the
vessel
which
rolled
very
little
although
the
sea
was
quite
rough
as
the
reached
the
deck
one
of
the
sailors
approached
the
captain
and
said
six
knots
and
a
quarter
in
that
case
we
shall
not
want
any
more
coal
until
we
arrive
at
behring
straits
answered
the
captain
after
saying
these
words
he
left
the
doctor
and
went
down
to
his
room
there
he
selected
a
large
chart
which
he
spread
out
before
him
under
a
brilliant
light
which
was
suspended
from
the
ceiling
it
was
a
map
of
the
british
admiralty
and
indicated
all
the
details
of
the
course
which
the
alaska
intended
to
take
the
shores
the
islands
the
the
revolving
lights
and
the
most
minute
details
were
all
clearly
marked
out
with
such
a
chart
and
a
compass
it
seemed
as
if
even
a
child
might
be
able
to
guide
the
largest
ship
through
these
perilous
passes
and
yet
a
distinguished
officer
of
the
french
navy
lieutenant
mage
who
had
explored
the
niger
had
been
lost
in
these
waters
with
all
his
companions
and
his
vessel
the
magician
it
had
happened
that
captain
marsilas
had
never
before
navigated
in
these
waters
in
fact
it
was
only
the
necessity
of
stopping
at
brest
which
had
brought
him
here
now
otherwise
he
would
have
passed
a
long
distance
from
shore
therefore
he
was
careful
to
study
his
chart
attentively
in
order
to
keep
his
proper
course
it
seemed
a
very
easy
matter
keeping
on
his
left
the
the
and
the
island
of
sein
the
legendary
abode
of
the
nine
druidesses
and
which
was
nearly
always
veiled
by
the
spray
of
the
roaring
waters
he
had
only
to
run
straight
to
the
west
and
to
the
south
to
reach
the
open
sea
the
light
on
the
island
indicated
clearly
his
position
and
according
to
the
chart
the
island
ended
in
rocky
heights
bordered
by
the
open
sea
whose
depth
reached
one
hundred
meters
the
light
on
the
island
was
a
useful
guide
on
a
dark
night
and
he
resolved
to
keep
closer
to
it
than
he
would
have
done
in
broad
daylight
he
therefore
ascended
to
the
deck
and
told
erik
to
sail
degrees
toward
the
southwest
this
order
appeared
to
surprise
the
young
lieutenant
to
the
did
you
say
he
asked
in
a
respectful
manner
believing
that
he
had
been
mistaken
yes
i
said
to
the
repeated
the
commander
dryly
do
you
not
like
this
route
since
you
ask
me
the
question
captain
i
must
confess
that
i
do
not
i
should
have
preferred
running
west
for
some
time
to
what
purpose
we
should
only
lose
another
night
the
commander
spoke
in
a
tone
that
did
not
permit
of
any
contradiction
and
erik
gave
the
order
which
he
had
received
after
all
the
captain
was
an
experienced
seaman
in
whom
they
might
have
perfect
confidence
slight
as
was
the
change
in
her
course
it
sufficed
to
modify
sensibly
the
sailing
of
the
vessel
the
alaska
commenced
to
roll
a
great
deal
and
to
dip
her
prow
in
the
waves
the
log
indicated
fourteen
knots
and
as
the
wind
was
increasing
erik
thought
it
prudent
to
take
a
couple
of
reefs
the
doctor
and
bredejord
both
became
a
prey
to
seasickness
and
descended
to
their
cabins
the
captain
who
had
for
some
time
been
pacing
up
and
down
the
deck
soon
followed
their
example
he
had
hardly
entered
his
own
apartment
when
erik
stood
before
him
captain
said
the
young
man
i
have
heard
suspicious
noises
like
waves
breaking
over
rocks
i
feel
conscientiously
bound
to
tell
you
that
in
my
opinion
we
are
following
a
dangerous
route
certainly
sir
you
are
gifted
with
tenaciousness
cried
the
captain
what
danger
can
you
fear
when
we
have
this
light
at
least
three
good
miles
if
not
four
distant
from
us
and
he
impatiently
with
his
finger
pointed
out
their
position
upon
the
chart
which
he
had
kept
spread
out
upon
his
table
erik
followed
the
direction
of
his
finger
and
he
saw
clearly
that
the
island
was
surrounded
by
very
deep
waters
nothing
could
be
more
decisive
and
reassuring
in
the
eyes
of
a
mariner
but
still
he
felt
sure
that
it
was
not
an
illusion
those
noises
which
he
had
heard
and
which
certainly
were
made
by
waves
breaking
upon
a
rocky
shore
very
close
to
them
it
was
a
strange
case
and
erik
hardly
liked
to
acknowledge
it
to
himself
but
it
did
not
seem
to
him
that
he
could
recognize
in
this
profile
of
the
coast
which
lay
spread
out
before
his
eyes
the
dangerous
spot
which
he
remembered
in
the
same
geographical
studies
which
he
had
pursued
but
could
he
venture
to
oppose
his
dim
impressions
and
vague
remembrances
against
a
chart
of
the
british
admiralty
erik
dared
not
do
it
these
charts
are
made
expressly
to
guard
navigators
against
errors
or
any
illusions
of
their
memory
he
therefore
bowed
respectfully
to
his
chief
and
returned
to
his
position
on
deck
he
had
scarcely
reached
it
when
he
heard
this
cry
resounding
through
the
vessel
breakers
on
the
starboard
followed
almost
immediately
by
a
second
shout
of
breakers
on
the
larboard
there
was
a
loud
whistle
and
a
clattering
of
many
feet
followed
by
a
series
of
effective
maneuvers
the
alaska
slackened
her
course
and
tried
to
back
out
the
captain
made
a
rush
up
the
stairs
at
this
moment
he
heard
a
grating
noise
then
suddenly
a
terrible
shock
which
shook
the
vessel
from
prow
to
stern
then
all
was
silent
and
the
alaska
remained
motionless
she
was
wedged
in
between
two
submarine
rocks
commander
marsilas
his
head
bleeding
from
a
fall
mounted
the
deck
where
the
greatest
confusion
reigned
the
dismayed
sailors
made
a
rush
for
the
boats
the
waves
dashed
furiously
over
the
rocks
upon
which
the
vessel
had
been
shipwrecked
the
distant
with
their
fixed
lights
seemed
to
reproach
the
alaska
for
having
thrown
herself
into
the
dangers
which
it
was
their
duty
to
point
out
erik
tried
vainly
to
penetrate
through
the
gloom
and
discover
the
extent
of
the
damage
which
the
vessel
had
sustained
what
is
the
matter
cried
the
captain
still
by
his
fall
by
sailing
sir
according
to
your
orders
we
have
run
upon
breakers
replied
erik
commander
marsilas
did
not
say
a
word
what
could
he
answer
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
walked
toward
the
staircase
again
their
situation
was
a
tragical
one
although
they
did
not
appear
to
be
in
any
immediate
peril
the
vessel
remained
motionless
between
the
rocks
which
seemed
to
hold
her
firmly
and
their
adventure
appeared
to
be
more
sad
than
frightful
erik
had
only
one
thought
the
expedition
was
brought
to
a
full
stop
his
hope
of
finding
patrick
was
lost
he
had
scarcely
made
his
somewhat
hasty
reply
to
the
captain
which
had
been
dictated
by
this
bitter
disappointment
than
he
regretted
having
done
so
he
therefore
left
the
deck
to
go
in
search
of
his
superior
officer
with
the
generous
intention
of
comforting
him
if
it
were
possible
to
do
so
but
the
captain
had
disappeared
and
three
minutes
had
not
elapsed
when
a
detonation
was
heard
erik
ran
to
his
room
the
door
was
fastened
on
the
inside
he
forced
it
open
with
a
blow
of
his
fist
commander
marsilas
lay
stretched
out
upon
the
carpet
with
a
revolver
in
his
right
hand
and
a
bullet
wound
in
his
forehead
seeing
that
the
vessel
was
shipwrecked
by
his
fault
he
had
blown
his
brains
out
death
had
been
instantaneous
the
doctor
and
bredejord
who
had
run
in
after
the
young
lieutenant
could
only
verify
the
sad
fact
but
there
was
no
time
for
vain
regrets
erik
left
to
his
two
friends
the
care
of
lifting
the
body
and
laying
it
upon
the
couch
his
duty
compelled
him
to
return
to
the
deck
and
attend
to
the
safety
of
the
crew
and
passengers
as
he
passed
the
door
of
malarius
the
excellent
man
who
had
been
awakened
by
the
stopping
of
the
vessel
and
also
by
the
report
of
the
pistol
opened
his
door
and
put
out
his
white
head
covered
by
his
black
silk
he
had
been
sleeping
ever
since
they
left
brest
and
was
therefore
ignorant
of
all
that
had
occurred
ah
well
what
is
it
has
anything
happened
he
asked
quietly
what
has
happened
replied
erik
my
dear
master
the
has
been
cast
upon
breakers
and
the
captain
has
killed
himself
oh
said
malarius
overcome
with
surprise
then
my
dear
child
adieu
to
our
expedition
that
is
another
affair
said
erik
i
am
not
dead
and
as
long
as
a
spark
of
life
remains
in
me
i
shall
say
forward
chapter
xiv
on
the
rocks
the
alaska
had
been
thrown
upon
the
rocks
with
such
violence
that
she
remained
perfectly
motionless
and
the
situation
did
not
appear
to
be
immediately
dangerous
for
her
crew
and
passengers
the
waves
encountering
this
unusual
obstacle
beat
over
the
deck
and
covered
everything
with
their
spray
but
the
sea
was
not
rough
enough
to
make
this
state
of
affairs
dangerous
if
the
weather
did
not
change
day
would
break
without
any
further
disaster
erik
saw
this
at
a
glance
he
had
naturally
taken
command
of
the
vessel
as
he
was
the
first
officer
having
given
orders
to
close
the
and
scuttles
carefully
and
to
throw
tarred
cloths
over
all
openings
in
case
the
sea
should
become
rougher
he
descended
to
the
bottom
of
the
hold
in
company
with
the
master
carpenter
there
he
saw
with
great
satisfaction
that
no
water
had
entered
the
exterior
covering
of
the
alaska
had
protected
her
and
the
precaution
which
they
had
taken
against
polar
icebergs
had
proved
very
efficacious
against
the
rocky
coast
in
fact
the
engine
had
stopped
at
once
being
disarranged
by
the
frightful
shock
but
it
had
produced
no
explosion
and
they
had
therefore
no
vital
damage
to
deplore
erik
resolved
to
wait
for
daybreak
and
then
disembark
his
passengers
if
it
should
prove
necessary
he
therefore
contented
himself
with
firing
a
cannon
to
ask
aid
from
the
inhabitants
of
the
island
of
sein
and
with
dispatching
his
small
steam
launch
to
he
said
to
himself
that
at
no
place
would
they
find
the
means
of
repairing
their
damages
so
promptly
and
well
as
at
this
great
maritime
arsenal
of
western
france
thus
in
this
glooming
hour
when
every
one
on
board
believed
that
their
chances
were
irretrievably
lost
he
already
began
to
feel
hopeful
or
rather
he
was
one
of
those
courageous
souls
who
know
no
discouragement
and
never
confess
themselves
vanquished
if
we
can
only
get
the
off
these
rocks
everything
may
yet
go
well
with
us
he
said
but
he
was
careful
not
to
express
this
hope
to
the
others
who
would
doubtless
have
considered
it
chimerical
he
only
told
them
when
he
returned
from
his
visit
to
the
hold
that
they
were
in
no
danger
at
present
and
that
there
was
plenty
of
time
for
them
to
receive
aid
then
he
ordered
a
distribution
of
tea
and
rum
to
all
the
crew
this
sufficed
to
put
these
children
of
a
larger
growth
in
a
good
humor
and
their
little
was
speedily
launched
some
rockets
from
the
of
sein
soon
announced
that
aid
was
coming
to
the
assistance
of
the
shipwrecked
vessel
red
lights
now
became
visible
and
voices
hailed
them
they
answered
that
they
had
been
shipwrecked
upon
the
rocks
surrounding
sein
it
was
a
full
hour
before
the
boat
could
reach
them
the
breakers
were
so
strong
that
the
attempt
was
perilous
but
at
length
six
men
succeeded
in
seizing
a
small
cable
and
hoisting
themselves
on
board
of
the
alaska
they
were
six
rude
fishermen
of
sein
strong
intrepid
fellows
and
it
was
not
the
first
time
they
had
gone
to
the
assistance
of
shipwrecked
mariners
they
fully
approved
of
the
idea
of
sending
to
for
assistance
for
their
little
port
could
not
offer
the
necessary
resources
it
was
agreed
that
two
of
them
should
depart
in
the
little
steamer
with
hersebom
and
otto
as
soon
as
the
moon
arose
above
the
horizon
while
they
were
waiting
for
it
to
do
so
they
gave
some
account
of
the
place
where
they
were
shipwrecked
the
rocks
extend
in
a
westerly
direction
for
nine
miles
beyond
the
island
of
sein
they
are
divided
into
two
parts
which
are
called
the
pont
du
sein
and
the
basse
froid
the
pont
du
sein
is
about
four
miles
long
and
a
mile
and
a
half
wide
it
is
composed
of
a
succession
of
high
rocks
which
form
a
chain
above
the
waters
the
basse
froid
extends
beyond
the
pont
du
sein
for
five
miles
and
is
two
thirds
of
a
mile
wide
it
consist
of
a
great
number
of
rocks
of
about
an
equal
height
which
can
be
seen
at
a
great
distance
the
principal
rocks
are
the
cornengen
schomeur
madiou
and
these
are
the
least
dangerous
because
they
can
be
seen
the
number
and
irregularity
of
their
points
under
the
water
are
not
fully
known
for
the
sea
beats
over
them
with
extreme
violence
the
force
of
the
current
is
very
strong
and
they
are
the
scene
of
many
shipwrecks
have
been
erected
on
the
island
of
sein
and
at
so
that
these
rocks
can
be
seen
and
avoided
by
vessels
coming
from
the
west
but
they
are
very
dangerous
for
vessels
coming
from
the
south
unfortunately
there
is
no
rock
or
small
island
at
the
extreme
end
where
a
signal
could
be
placed
and
the
turbulence
of
the
waters
will
not
permit
a
floating
one
to
be
placed
there
therefore
it
was
resolved
to
build
a
on
the
rock
which
is
three
miles
from
the
extreme
point
this
work
is
so
extremely
difficult
that
although
it
was
commenced
in
twelve
years
later
in
it
was
only
half
built
they
say
that
during
the
latter
year
it
was
only
possible
to
work
for
eight
hours
although
the
workmen
were
always
ready
to
seize
a
favorable
moment
the
therefore
was
not
yet
completed
at
the
time
when
the
alaska
met
with
her
disaster
but
this
did
not
suffice
to
explain
how
after
leaving
brest
they
had
been
run
into
such
peril
erik
promised
himself
that
he
would
solve
this
difficulty
as
soon
as
the
little
had
been
dispatched
for
aid
this
departure
was
easily
effected
the
moon
having
soon
made
its
appearance
the
young
captain
then
appointed
the
night
watch
and
sent
the
rest
of
the
crew
to
bed
then
he
descended
to
the
captain
room
bredejord
malarius
and
the
doctor
were
keeping
watch
beside
the
corpse
they
arose
as
soon
as
they
saw
erik
my
poor
child
what
is
the
cause
of
this
sad
state
of
things
how
did
it
happen
asked
the
doctor
it
is
inexplicable
answered
the
young
man
looking
at
the
chart
which
lay
open
upon
the
table
i
felt
instinctively
that
we
were
out
of
our
route
and
i
said
so
but
in
my
estimation
we
are
at
least
three
miles
from
the
and
all
the
seamen
agree
with
me
he
added
designating
a
spot
with
his
finger
on
the
map
and
you
see
no
danger
is
indicated
no
or
rocks
this
coloring
indicates
deep
water
it
is
inconceivable
how
the
mistake
can
have
occurred
we
can
not
suppose
that
a
chart
of
the
british
admiralty
can
be
at
fault
for
it
is
a
region
well
known
to
mariners
as
it
has
been
minutely
explored
for
centuries
is
it
not
possible
to
make
a
mistake
as
to
our
position
could
not
one
light
be
mistaken
for
another
asked
bredejord
that
is
scarcely
possible
in
a
voyage
as
short
as
ours
has
been
since
we
left
brest
said
erik
remember
that
we
have
not
lost
sight
of
land
for
a
moment
and
that
we
have
been
passing
from
one
point
to
another
we
can
only
suppose
that
one
of
the
lights
indicated
on
the
chart
has
not
been
lighted
or
that
some
supplementary
light
has
been
added
in
a
word
we
must
imagine
what
is
highly
improbable
our
course
has
been
so
regular
the
soundings
have
been
so
carefully
made
that
it
seems
impossible
that
we
could
have
mistaken
our
route
and
yet
the
fact
remains
that
we
are
on
the
rocks
when
we
ought
to
have
been
some
distance
out
to
sea
but
how
is
it
going
to
end
that
is
what
i
want
to
know
cried
the
doctor
we
shall
soon
see
answered
erik
if
the
maritime
authorities
show
any
eagerness
to
come
to
our
assistance
for
the
present
the
best
thing
that
every
one
can
do
is
to
go
quietly
to
bed
since
we
are
as
secure
as
if
we
were
at
anchor
in
some
quiet
bay
the
young
commander
did
not
add
that
it
was
his
intention
to
keep
watch
while
his
friends
slept
nevertheless
this
is
what
he
did
for
the
remainder
of
the
night
sometimes
promenading
the
deck
and
encouraging
the
men
sometimes
descending
for
a
few
minutes
to
the
saloon
as
day
commenced
to
dawn
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
perceiving
that
the
waves
visibly
receded
and
if
they
continued
to
do
so
the
alaska
would
be
left
almost
on
dry
rocks
this
gave
him
hope
of
being
able
speedily
to
determine
the
extent
of
the
damage
which
the
vessel
had
received
and
in
fact
toward
seven
they
were
able
to
proceed
with
this
examination
they
found
that
three
points
of
the
rocks
had
pierced
the
alaska
and
held
her
firmly
on
her
rocky
bed
the
direction
in
which
she
lay
slightly
inclined
to
the
north
which
was
contrary
to
her
course
showed
that
the
commands
given
by
erik
to
back
the
vessel
had
saved
her
and
also
rendered
the
shock
when
she
struck
less
severe
the
engine
had
been
reversed
some
seconds
before
she
touched
and
she
had
been
carried
on
the
reef
by
the
remainder
of
her
previous
speed
and
by
the
force
of
the
current
doubtless
but
for
this
she
would
have
gone
to
pieces
besides
the
waves
having
continued
to
break
against
her
all
night
in
the
same
direction
had
helped
to
keep
her
in
her
place
instead
of
fixing
her
more
firmly
on
the
rocks
which
would
have
happened
if
the
wind
had
changed
so
after
all
there
was
a
favorable
view
to
take
of
the
disaster
the
question
now
was
how
to
get
the
vessel
off
before
the
wind
should
change
and
reverse
these
favorable
conditions
erik
resolved
not
to
lose
a
moment
immediately
after
breakfast
he
set
all
his
men
to
work
he
hoped
that
when
the
should
arrive
which
he
had
sent
for
from
it
might
be
possible
at
high
tide
to
disengage
the
alaska
we
can
therefore
imagine
that
the
young
captain
waited
impatiently
for
the
first
trace
of
smoke
upon
the
horizon
all
turned
out
as
he
desired
the
water
remained
calm
and
peaceful
toward
noon
the
boat
arrived
erik
with
his
staff
received
the
mariners
with
due
honors
but
explain
to
me
said
the
captain
of
the
how
you
came
to
cast
your
vessel
on
these
rocks
after
leaving
brest
this
chart
will
explain
it
said
erik
it
does
not
point
out
any
such
danger
the
french
officer
examined
the
chart
with
curiosity
at
first
and
then
he
looked
stupefied
in
fact
the
is
not
marked
down
nor
the
point
of
sein
he
cried
what
unparalleled
negligence
why
even
the
position
of
the
is
not
correctly
marked
i
am
more
and
more
surprised
this
is
a
chart
of
the
british
admiralty
i
should
say
that
some
one
has
taken
pleasure
in
making
it
as
deceitful
and
perfidious
as
possible
navigators
of
olden
times
frequently
played
such
tricks
upon
their
rivals
i
should
never
have
believed
such
traditions
would
be
imitated
in
england
are
you
sure
that
this
is
an
english
chart
asked
bredejord
for
myself
i
suspect
that
the
chart
is
the
work
of
a
rascal
and
has
been
placed
with
criminal
intentions
among
the
charts
of
the
by
tudor
brown
cried
erik
impetuously
that
evening
when
we
dined
with
the
authorities
at
brest
he
entered
the
captain
room
upon
the
pretense
of
examining
the
charts
oh
the
infamous
wretch
this
then
is
the
reason
that
he
did
not
come
on
board
again
it
appears
to
be
only
too
evident
that
he
is
the
culprit
said
schwaryencrona
but
such
a
dastardly
action
betrays
such
an
abyss
of
iniquity
what
motive
could
he
have
for
committing
such
a
crime
what
was
his
motive
in
coming
to
stockholm
expressly
to
tell
you
that
patrick
was
dead
answered
bredejord
for
what
purpose
did
he
subscribe
twenty
thousand
kroners
for
the
voyage
of
the
when
it
was
doubtful
if
she
would
ever
make
the
journey
why
did
he
embark
with
us
to
leave
us
at
brest
i
think
we
must
be
blind
indeed
if
we
do
not
see
in
these
facts
a
chain
of
evidence
as
logical
as
it
is
frightful
what
interest
has
tudor
brown
in
all
this
i
do
not
know
but
this
interest
must
be
very
strong
very
powerful
to
induce
him
to
have
recourse
to
such
means
to
prevent
our
journey
for
i
am
convinced
now
that
it
was
he
who
caused
the
accident
which
detained
us
at
brest
and
it
was
he
who
led
us
upon
these
rocks
where
he
expected
we
would
all
lose
our
lives
it
seems
difficult
however
to
believe
that
he
could
have
foreseen
the
route
that
captain
marsilas
would
choose
objected
malarias
why
did
he
not
indicate
this
route
by
altering
the
chart
after
delaying
us
for
three
days
he
felt
certain
that
the
captain
would
take
the
shortest
way
the
latter
believing
that
the
waters
were
safe
around
sein
was
thrown
upon
the
rocks
it
is
true
said
erik
but
the
proof
that
the
result
of
his
maneuvers
was
uncertain
lies
in
the
fact
that
i
insisted
before
captain
marsilas
that
we
ought
still
to
keep
to
the
west
but
who
knows
whether
he
has
not
prepared
other
charts
to
lead
us
astray
in
case
this
one
failed
to
do
so
said
bredejord
that
is
easily
determined
answered
erik
who
went
and
brought
all
the
charts
and
maps
that
were
in
the
case
the
first
one
which
they
opened
was
that
of
corunna
and
at
a
glance
the
french
officer
pointed
out
two
or
three
grave
errors
the
second
was
that
of
cape
vincent
it
was
the
same
the
third
was
that
of
gibraltar
here
the
errors
were
apparent
to
every
eye
a
more
thorough
examination
would
have
been
superfluous
as
it
was
impossible
to
doubt
any
longer
if
the
alaska
had
not
been
shipwrecked
on
the
island
of
sein
this
fate
would
surely
have
awaited
her
before
she
could
have
reached
malta
a
careful
examination
of
the
charts
revealed
the
means
which
had
been
employed
to
effect
these
changes
they
were
undoubtedly
english
charts
but
they
had
been
partly
effaced
by
some
chemical
process
and
then
retouched
so
as
to
indicate
false
routes
among
the
true
ones
they
had
been
recolored
so
skillfully
that
only
a
very
slight
difference
in
the
tints
could
be
perceived
after
the
most
careful
scrutiny
but
there
was
one
circumstance
which
betrayed
the
criminal
intentions
with
which
they
had
been
placed
on
board
the
alaska
all
the
charts
belonging
to
the
vessel
bore
the
seal
of
the
secretary
of
the
swedish
navy
the
forger
had
foreseen
that
they
would
not
be
examined
too
minutely
and
had
hoped
that
by
following
them
they
would
all
come
to
a
watery
grave
these
successive
discoveries
had
produced
consternation
in
the
breasts
of
all
who
were
present
erik
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
which
had
succeeded
the
conversation
poor
captain
marsilas
he
said
in
a
trembling
voice
he
has
suffered
for
us
all
but
since
we
have
escaped
almost
by
a
miracle
the
fate
which
was
prepared
for
us
let
us
run
no
more
risks
the
tide
is
rising
and
it
may
be
possible
to
draw
the
off
the
rocks
if
you
are
willing
gentlemen
we
will
go
and
commence
operations
without
delay
he
spoke
with
simple
authority
and
a
modest
dignity
with
which
the
feeling
of
responsibility
had
already
inspired
him
to
see
a
young
man
of
his
age
invested
with
the
command
of
a
ship
under
such
circumstances
and
for
such
a
hazardous
expedition
was
certainly
an
unforeseen
occurrence
but
he
felt
that
he
was
equal
to
the
performance
of
all
his
duties
he
knew
that
he
could
rely
upon
himself
and
upon
his
crew
and
these
thoughts
transfigured
him
the
youth
of
yesterday
was
a
man
the
spirit
of
a
hero
burned
in
his
eyes
he
rose
superior
to
the
calamity
which
had
befallen
them
his
ability
impressed
all
who
approached
him
even
the
doctor
and
bredejord
submitted
to
him
like
the
others
the
operation
of
preparing
for
their
morning
work
proved
easier
than
they
had
hoped
lifted
by
the
rising
waters
the
vessel
only
required
a
slight
force
to
take
her
off
the
rocks
a
few
hours
of
hard
work
were
sufficient
to
accomplish
this
and
the
alaska
was
once
more
afloat
strained
indeed
and
weighed
down
by
the
water
which
made
its
way
into
some
of
her
compartments
and
with
her
engine
silent
but
manageable
all
the
crew
who
were
assembled
on
the
deck
watched
anxiously
the
result
of
these
efforts
and
a
loud
hurrah
greeted
the
deliverance
of
the
alaska
the
frenchmen
replied
to
this
joyful
cry
with
similar
acclamations
it
was
now
three
in
the
afternoon
above
the
horizon
the
beautiful
february
sun
inundated
the
calm
sparkling
sea
with
floods
of
sunshine
which
fell
also
on
the
rocks
of
the
as
if
to
efface
all
remembrance
of
the
drama
which
had
been
enacted
there
the
previous
night
that
same
evening
the
alaska
had
been
safely
towed
into
the
harbor
of
the
next
day
the
french
maritime
authorities
with
the
utmost
courtesy
authorized
the
necessary
repairs
to
be
made
without
delay
the
damage
which
the
vessel
had
sustained
was
not
serious
but
that
of
the
machinery
was
more
complicated
although
not
irremediable
necessarily
it
would
take
some
time
to
render
her
seaworthy
but
nowhere
in
the
world
as
erik
had
foreseen
could
this
be
accomplished
so
speedily
as
at
this
port
which
possessed
such
immense
resources
for
naval
construction
the
house
of
gainard
norris
undertook
to
make
the
repairs
in
three
weeks
it
was
now
the
of
february
on
the
of
march
they
would
be
able
to
resume
their
voyage
and
this
time
with
good
charts
that
would
leave
three
months
and
a
half
for
them
to
reach
strait
by
the
end
of
june
it
was
not
impossible
to
do
this
although
the
time
was
very
limited
erik
would
not
hear
of
abandoning
the
enterprise
he
feared
only
one
thing
and
that
was
being
compelled
to
do
so
therefore
he
refused
to
send
to
stockholm
a
report
of
the
shipwreck
and
he
would
not
make
a
formal
complaint
against
the
presumed
author
of
the
attempt
to
shipwreck
them
for
fear
of
being
delayed
by
legal
proceedings
yet
he
had
his
fears
that
this
might
encourage
tudor
brown
to
throw
some
new
obstacle
in
the
way
of
the
alaska
this
is
what
schwaryencrona
and
bredejord
asked
each
other
as
they
were
playing
at
whist
with
malarius
in
the
little
of
the
hotel
to
which
they
had
gone
after
arriving
at
as
for
bredejord
he
had
no
doubts
about
the
matter
a
rascal
like
tudor
brown
if
he
knew
of
the
failure
of
his
scheme
and
how
could
any
one
doubt
that
he
was
acquainted
with
this
fact
would
not
hesitate
to
renew
the
attempt
to
believe
that
they
would
ever
succeed
in
reaching
behring
strait
was
therefore
more
than
it
was
foolishness
bredejord
did
not
know
what
steps
tudor
brown
would
take
to
prevent
this
but
he
felt
certain
that
he
would
find
some
means
of
doing
so
schwaryencrona
was
inclined
to
the
same
opinion
and
even
malarius
could
not
think
of
anything
very
reassuring
to
say
the
games
of
whist
were
therefore
not
very
lively
and
the
long
strolls
that
the
three
friends
took
were
not
very
gay
their
principal
occupation
was
to
watch
the
erection
of
the
mausoleum
which
they
were
building
for
poor
captain
marsilas
whose
funeral
obsequies
had
been
attended
by
the
entire
population
of
the
sight
of
this
funeral
monument
was
not
calculated
to
raise
the
spirits
of
the
survivors
of
the
alaska
but
when
they
joined
erik
again
their
hopes
revived
his
resolution
was
unshakable
his
activity
untiring
he
was
so
bent
upon
overcoming
all
obstacles
so
certain
of
success
that
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
express
or
even
to
preserve
less
heroic
sentiments
they
had
a
new
proof
of
the
malignity
of
tudor
brown
and
that
he
still
was
pursuing
them
on
the
of
march
erik
saw
that
the
work
upon
the
machinery
was
almost
finished
they
only
had
to
adjust
the
pumps
and
that
was
to
be
done
the
next
day
but
in
the
night
between
the
and
the
body
of
the
pump
disappeared
from
the
workshop
of
the
gainard
norris
co
it
was
impossible
to
find
it
how
had
it
been
taken
away
who
had
done
it
after
investigation
they
were
unable
to
discover
however
it
would
take
ten
days
more
to
replace
it
and
that
would
make
it
the
of
march
before
the
alaska
could
leave
it
was
a
singular
fact
but
this
incident
affected
erik
spirits
more
than
the
shipwreck
had
done
he
saw
in
it
a
sure
sign
of
a
persistent
desire
to
prevent
the
voyage
of
the
alaska
but
these
efforts
only
redoubled
his
ardor
and
he
determined
that
nothing
should
be
wanting
on
his
part
to
bring
the
expedition
to
a
successful
termination
these
ten
days
of
delay
were
almost
exclusively
occupied
by
him
in
considering
the
question
in
all
its
aspects
the
more
he
studied
the
more
he
became
convinced
that
he
could
not
reach
behring
straits
in
three
months
for
they
had
suffered
a
detention
of
forty
days
since
they
had
left
stockholm
and
to
persist
would
only
be
to
court
failure
and
perhaps
some
irremediable
disaster
this
conclusion
did
not
stop
him
but
it
only
led
him
to
think
that
some
modification
of
their
original
plans
was
indispensable
he
took
care
however
to
say
nothing
rightly
judging
that
secrecy
was
the
first
condition
of
victory
he
contented
himself
with
watching
more
closely
than
ever
the
work
of
repairing
the
vessel
but
his
companions
thought
that
they
perceived
that
he
was
less
eager
to
set
out
they
therefore
concluded
that
he
saw
that
the
enterprise
was
impracticable
which
they
had
also
believed
for
some
time
but
they
were
mistaken
on
the
of
march
at
midday
the
repairs
of
the
alaska
were
completed
and
she
was
once
more
afloat
in
the
harbor
of
chapter
xv
the
shortest
route
night
was
closing
in
when
erik
summoned
his
three
friends
and
counselors
to
hold
a
serious
consultation
i
have
reflected
a
great
deal
he
said
to
them
upon
the
circumstances
which
have
made
our
voyage
memorable
since
we
left
stockholm
i
have
been
forced
to
arrive
at
one
conclusion
which
is
that
we
must
expect
to
meet
with
obstacles
or
accidents
during
our
voyage
perhaps
they
may
befall
us
at
gibraltar
or
at
malta
if
we
are
not
destroyed
it
appears
to
me
certain
that
we
shall
be
delayed
in
that
case
we
can
not
reach
behring
straits
during
the
summer
which
is
the
only
season
when
it
is
practicable
to
navigate
the
polar
sea
that
is
also
the
conclusion
which
i
formed
some
time
ago
declared
bredejord
but
i
kept
it
to
myself
as
i
did
not
wish
to
dampen
your
hopes
my
dear
boy
but
i
am
sure
that
we
must
give
up
the
idea
of
reaching
behring
strait
in
three
months
that
is
also
my
opinion
said
the
doctor
malarius
on
his
part
indicated
by
a
motion
of
his
head
that
he
agreed
with
them
all
well
said
erik
having
settled
that
point
what
line
of
conduct
now
remains
for
us
to
adopt
there
is
one
right
course
which
it
is
our
duty
to
take
answered
bredejord
it
is
to
renounce
an
enterprise
which
we
see
clearly
is
impracticable
and
return
to
stockholm
you
understand
this
fact
my
child
and
i
congratulate
you
upon
being
able
to
look
the
situation
calmly
in
the
face
you
pay
me
a
compliment
which
i
can
not
accept
said
erik
smiling
for
i
do
not
merit
it
no
i
have
no
thoughts
of
abandoning
the
expedition
for
i
am
far
from
regarding
it
as
impracticable
i
only
think
that
it
is
best
for
us
all
to
baffle
the
machinations
of
that
scoundrel
who
is
lying
in
wait
for
us
and
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
change
our
route
such
a
change
would
only
complicate
our
difficulties
replied
the
doctor
since
we
have
adopted
the
shortest
one
if
it
would
be
difficult
to
reach
behring
straits
by
the
mediterranean
and
the
suez
canal
it
would
be
impossible
by
the
cape
of
good
hope
or
cape
horn
for
either
of
these
routes
would
necessarily
take
five
or
six
months
there
is
another
way
which
would
shorten
our
voyage
instead
of
lengthening
it
and
where
we
would
be
sure
not
to
meet
tudor
brown
said
erik
another
way
answered
schwaryencrona
upon
my
word
i
do
not
know
of
any
unless
you
are
thinking
of
the
way
of
panama
but
it
is
not
yet
practicable
for
vessels
and
it
will
not
be
yet
for
several
years
i
am
not
thinking
of
panama
nor
of
cape
horn
nor
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
answered
the
young
captain
of
the
alaska
the
route
i
propose
is
the
only
one
by
which
we
can
reach
behring
strait
in
three
months
it
is
to
go
by
way
of
the
arctic
ocean
the
passage
then
seeing
that
his
friends
were
stupefied
by
this
unexpected
announcement
erik
proceeded
to
develop
his
plans
the
passage
now
is
no
longer
what
it
was
formerly
frightful
to
navigators
it
is
intermittent
since
it
is
only
open
for
eight
or
ten
weeks
every
year
but
it
is
now
well
known
marked
out
upon
excellent
charts
and
frequented
by
hundreds
of
it
is
rarely
taken
by
any
vessel
going
from
the
atlantic
to
the
pacific
ocean
i
must
admit
most
of
them
who
enter
it
from
either
side
only
traverse
it
partially
it
might
even
happen
if
circumstances
were
not
favorable
that
we
might
find
the
passage
closed
or
that
it
might
not
be
open
at
the
precise
time
when
we
desired
to
enter
it
it
is
a
risk
that
one
must
take
but
i
think
there
are
many
reasons
to
make
us
hopeful
of
success
if
we
take
this
route
whilst
as
far
as
i
can
see
there
is
none
if
we
take
any
of
the
others
this
being
the
state
of
affairs
i
think
it
is
our
duty
a
duty
which
we
owe
to
those
who
have
fitted
out
the
expedition
to
take
the
shortest
way
of
reaching
behring
strait
an
ordinary
vessel
equipped
for
navigating
tropical
waters
might
hesitate
before
deciding
upon
such
a
course
but
with
a
vessel
like
the
fitted
out
especially
for
polar
navigation
we
need
not
hesitate
for
my
part
i
declare
that
i
will
not
return
to
stockholm
before
having
attempted
to
find
nordenskiold
erik
reasoning
was
so
sound
that
nobody
tried
to
contradict
it
what
objections
could
the
doctor
bredejord
and
malarius
raise
they
saw
the
difficulties
which
beset
the
new
plan
but
it
was
possible
that
these
difficulties
might
not
prove
insurmountable
whilst
if
they
pursued
any
other
course
they
must
abandon
all
hopes
of
success
besides
they
did
not
hesitate
to
agree
with
erik
that
it
would
be
more
glorious
in
any
case
to
make
the
attempt
than
to
return
to
stockholm
and
acknowledge
themselves
conquered
i
see
but
one
serious
objection
for
my
part
said
schwaryencrona
after
he
had
remained
for
a
few
moments
lost
in
reflection
it
is
the
difficulty
of
procuring
coal
in
the
arctic
regions
for
without
coal
adieu
to
the
possibility
of
making
the
passage
and
of
profiting
by
the
time
often
very
short
during
which
it
is
practicable
i
have
foreseen
this
difficulty
which
is
in
fact
the
only
one
answered
erik
and
i
do
not
think
it
is
insurmountable
in
place
of
going
to
malta
or
gibraltar
where
we
might
doubtless
expect
new
machinations
on
the
part
of
tudor
brown
i
propose
that
we
go
to
london
from
there
i
can
send
by
transatlantic
cable
a
dispatch
to
a
house
in
montreal
to
send
without
delay
a
boat
loaded
with
coal
to
wait
for
us
in
baffin
bay
and
to
a
house
in
san
francisco
to
send
to
strait
we
have
the
necessary
funds
at
our
disposal
and
besides
we
will
not
require
as
much
as
we
would
have
done
if
we
had
gone
by
the
way
of
asia
for
our
new
route
is
a
much
shorter
one
it
is
useless
for
us
to
reach
baffin
bay
before
the
end
of
may
and
we
can
not
hope
to
reach
behring
strait
before
the
end
of
june
our
correspondents
in
montreal
and
san
francisco
will
therefore
have
plenty
of
time
to
execute
our
orders
which
will
be
covered
by
funds
deposited
with
bankers
in
london
this
accomplished
we
shall
only
have
to
find
out
whether
the
passage
is
practicable
and
that
evidently
depends
upon
ourselves
but
if
we
find
the
passage
closed
at
least
we
shall
have
the
consolation
of
knowing
that
we
have
neglected
nothing
that
could
have
insured
our
success
it
is
evident
said
malarius
that
your
arguments
are
unanswerable
gently
gently
said
bredejord
do
not
let
us
go
too
fast
i
have
another
objection
do
you
think
my
dear
erik
that
the
can
pass
unnoticed
through
these
waters
no
it
is
not
possible
the
newspapers
would
mention
our
arrival
the
telegraph
companies
would
make
it
known
tudor
brown
would
know
it
he
would
know
that
we
had
changed
our
plans
what
would
prevent
him
from
altering
his
do
you
think
for
example
that
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
prevent
our
boat
with
coals
from
reaching
us
and
without
it
we
could
do
nothing
that
is
true
answered
erik
and
it
proves
that
we
must
think
of
everything
we
must
not
go
to
london
we
must
put
into
lisbon
as
if
we
were
to
gibraltar
and
suez
then
one
of
us
must
go
to
madrid
and
without
explaining
why
or
for
whom
it
is
intended
must
open
telegraphic
communications
with
montreal
and
san
francisco
to
order
the
supply
of
coal
the
crews
of
these
boats
must
not
know
for
whom
the
coal
is
destined
but
remain
at
designated
points
at
the
disposition
of
a
captain
who
will
carry
an
order
to
them
previously
agreed
upon
a
perfect
arrangement
it
will
be
almost
impossible
for
tudor
brown
to
track
us
you
mean
to
track
me
for
i
hope
that
you
do
not
think
of
accompanying
me
to
these
arctic
regions
said
erik
indeed
that
is
my
intention
answered
the
doctor
it
shall
not
be
said
that
that
rascal
tudor
brown
made
me
turn
back
nor
me
either
cried
bredejord
and
malarius
together
the
young
captain
tried
to
combat
this
resolution
and
explained
to
his
friends
the
dangers
and
monotony
of
the
voyage
which
they
proposed
to
take
with
him
but
he
could
not
alter
their
decision
the
perils
which
they
had
already
encountered
made
them
feel
it
a
duty
to
keep
together
for
the
only
way
of
rendering
such
a
voyage
acceptable
to
them
all
was
not
to
separate
every
precaution
had
been
taken
to
protect
the
persons
on
board
the
alaska
from
suffering
unduly
from
cold
and
neither
swedes
nor
norwegians
fear
frost
erik
was
obliged
to
yield
to
their
wishes
only
stipulating
that
their
change
of
route
should
not
be
made
known
to
the
crew
of
the
vessel
the
first
part
of
their
voyage
was
quickly
accomplished
on
the
of
april
the
alaska
reached
lisbon
before
the
newspapers
had
given
notice
of
their
arrival
bredejord
had
gone
to
madrid
and
by
means
of
a
opened
communications
with
two
large
firms
one
in
montreal
and
one
in
san
francisco
he
had
arranged
to
have
two
of
coal
sent
to
two
designated
points
and
had
given
the
sign
by
which
erik
was
to
make
himself
known
this
sign
was
the
words
found
upon
him
when
he
was
discovered
floating
tied
to
the
buoy
of
the
cynthia
semper
idem
finally
these
arrangements
having
all
been
happily
concluded
on
the
of
april
bredejord
returned
to
lisbon
and
the
alaska
resumed
her
voyage
on
the
of
the
same
month
having
crossed
the
atlantic
and
reached
montreal
where
they
took
in
coal
and
erik
was
assured
that
his
orders
had
been
punctually
fulfilled
they
left
the
waters
of
the
lawrence
and
straits
of
belle
isle
which
separate
labrador
from
newfoundland
on
the
of
may
they
reached
the
coast
of
greenland
and
found
the
vessel
with
their
coal
it
having
arrived
before
them
erik
knew
very
well
that
at
this
early
date
it
would
be
useless
to
attempt
to
force
his
way
through
the
arctic
ocean
which
was
still
firmly
frozen
over
the
largest
part
of
his
route
but
he
counted
upon
obtaining
on
these
shores
which
were
much
frequented
by
precise
information
as
to
the
best
charts
and
he
was
not
mistaken
he
was
also
able
to
buy
although
at
a
high
price
a
dozen
dogs
who
with
kaas
could
draw
their
sledges
if
necessary
among
the
danish
stations
on
the
coast
of
greenland
he
found
godhaven
which
is
only
a
poor
village
and
is
used
as
a
depot
by
dealers
in
oil
and
the
furs
of
the
country
at
this
time
of
the
year
the
cold
is
not
more
severe
than
at
stockholm
or
noroe
but
erik
and
his
friends
beheld
with
surprise
the
great
difference
between
the
two
countries
both
situated
at
the
same
distance
from
the
pole
godhaven
is
in
precisely
the
same
latitude
as
bergen
but
whilst
the
southern
port
of
norway
is
in
april
covered
with
green
forests
and
fruit
trees
and
even
cultivated
vines
trained
upon
trellises
above
green
meadows
greenland
is
still
in
may
covered
with
ice
and
snow
without
a
tree
to
enliven
the
monotony
the
shape
of
the
norwegian
coast
deeply
indented
by
fjords
and
sheltered
by
chains
of
islands
which
contribute
almost
as
much
as
the
warmth
of
the
gulf
stream
to
raise
the
temperature
of
the
country
greenland
on
the
contrary
has
a
low
regular
coast
and
receives
the
full
shock
of
the
cold
blasts
from
the
pole
consequently
she
is
enveloped
almost
to
the
middle
of
the
island
by
fields
of
ice
several
feet
in
thickness
they
spent
fifteen
days
in
the
harbor
and
then
the
alaska
mounted
davis
straits
and
keeping
along
the
coast
of
greenland
gained
the
polar
sea
on
the
of
may
for
the
first
time
they
encountered
floating
ice
in
of
north
latitude
with
a
temperature
two
degrees
below
zero
these
first
icebergs
it
is
true
were
in
a
crumbling
condition
rapidly
breaking
up
into
small
fragments
but
soon
they
became
more
dense
and
frequently
they
had
to
break
their
way
through
them
navigation
although
difficult
was
not
as
yet
dangerous
by
a
thousand
signs
they
perceived
however
that
they
were
in
a
new
world
all
objects
at
a
little
distance
appeared
to
be
colorless
and
almost
without
form
the
eye
could
find
no
place
to
repose
in
this
perpetually
changing
horizon
which
every
minute
assumed
a
new
aspect
who
can
describe
says
an
these
melancholy
surroundings
the
roaring
of
the
waves
beating
beneath
the
floating
ice
the
singular
noise
made
by
the
snow
as
it
falls
suddenly
into
the
abyss
of
waters
who
can
imagine
the
beauty
of
the
cascades
which
gush
out
on
all
sides
the
sea
of
foam
produced
by
their
fall
the
fright
of
the
who
having
fallen
asleep
on
a
pyramid
of
ice
suddenly
find
their
overturned
and
themselves
obliged
to
fly
to
some
other
spot
and
in
the
morning
when
the
sun
bursts
through
the
fog
at
first
only
a
little
of
the
blue
sky
is
visible
but
it
gradually
widens
until
the
view
is
only
limited
by
the
horizon
these
spectacles
presented
by
the
polar
sea
erik
and
his
friends
were
able
to
contemplate
at
their
leisure
as
they
left
the
coast
of
greenland
to
which
they
had
kept
close
until
they
had
reached
uppernavik
then
they
sailed
westward
across
baffin
bay
here
navigation
became
more
difficult
for
this
sea
is
the
ordinary
course
of
the
polar
icebergs
which
are
drawn
in
by
the
innumerable
currents
which
traverse
it
sometimes
they
found
their
course
checked
by
insurmountable
barriers
of
ice
which
it
was
impossible
to
break
and
therefore
they
were
compelled
to
turn
aside
the
alaska
was
obliged
continually
to
break
her
way
through
immense
fields
of
ice
sometimes
a
tempest
of
snow
assailed
them
which
covered
the
deck
and
the
masts
with
a
thick
coat
sometimes
they
were
assailed
by
ice
dashed
over
them
by
the
wind
which
threatened
to
sink
the
vessel
by
its
weight
sometimes
they
found
themselves
in
a
sort
of
lake
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
fields
of
ice
apparently
firm
and
impassable
and
from
which
they
had
great
difficulty
to
extricate
themselves
and
gain
the
open
sea
then
they
had
to
exercise
great
vigilance
to
escape
some
enormous
iceberg
sailing
down
from
the
north
with
incredible
swiftness
a
frightful
mass
which
could
have
crushed
the
alaska
like
a
walnut
but
a
greater
danger
still
was
the
submarine
ice
which
could
injure
her
and
act
like
a
the
alaska
lost
her
two
large
boats
one
must
experience
the
dangers
which
polar
navigation
presents
at
every
moment
to
have
any
just
appreciation
of
them
after
one
or
two
weeks
of
such
experience
the
most
intrepid
crew
become
exhausted
and
repose
is
necessary
for
them
sometimes
although
surrounded
by
all
these
dangers
they
made
rapid
progress
at
others
they
made
scarcely
any
but
at
length
on
the
of
june
they
came
in
sight
of
land
again
and
cast
anchor
at
the
entrance
to
lancaster
sound
erik
had
expected
to
be
obliged
to
wait
some
days
before
being
able
to
enter
the
sound
but
to
his
surprise
and
joy
he
found
it
open
at
least
at
the
entrance
he
entered
resolutely
but
only
to
find
the
next
day
his
passage
impeded
by
ice
which
held
them
prisoners
for
three
days
but
thanks
to
the
violent
currents
which
sweep
through
this
arctic
canal
he
at
last
was
able
to
free
his
vessel
and
continue
his
route
as
the
whalers
of
godhaven
had
told
him
he
would
be
able
to
do
on
the
seventeenth
he
arrived
at
barrow
straits
and
made
all
the
speed
he
could
but
on
the
nineteenth
as
he
was
about
to
enter
melville
sound
he
was
again
blocked
in
by
the
ice
at
first
he
patiently
accepted
the
situation
waiting
for
it
to
break
up
but
day
succeeded
to
day
and
still
this
did
not
happen
there
were
however
many
sources
of
amusement
open
to
the
voyagers
they
were
near
the
coast
and
supplied
with
everything
that
could
render
their
life
comfortable
in
that
latitude
they
could
take
and
see
in
the
distance
the
whales
enjoying
their
diversions
the
summer
solstice
was
approaching
since
the
fifteenth
the
occupants
of
the
alaska
had
beheld
a
new
and
astonishing
spectacle
even
for
norwegians
and
the
natives
of
southern
sweden
it
was
the
sun
at
midnight
touching
the
horizon
without
disappearing
and
then
mounting
again
in
the
sky
in
these
high
latitudes
and
desolate
coasts
the
star
of
day
describes
in
hours
a
complete
circle
in
space
the
light
it
is
true
is
pale
and
languishing
objects
lose
their
perfect
shape
and
all
nature
has
a
shadowy
appearance
one
realizes
profoundly
how
far
he
is
removed
from
the
world
and
how
near
he
is
to
the
pole
the
cold
however
was
not
extreme
the
temperature
did
not
fall
more
than
four
or
five
degrees
below
zero
and
the
air
was
sometimes
so
mild
that
they
could
hardly
believe
that
they
were
in
the
center
of
the
arctic
zone
but
those
novel
surrounding
were
not
sufficient
to
satisfy
erik
or
make
him
lose
sight
of
the
supreme
object
which
had
brought
them
there
he
had
not
come
to
herbalize
like
malarius
who
returned
every
evening
more
and
more
delighted
with
his
explorations
both
of
the
country
and
of
its
unknown
plants
which
he
added
to
his
collection
nor
to
enjoy
with
schwaryencrona
and
bredejord
the
novelty
of
the
sights
which
nature
offered
to
them
in
these
polar
regions
he
wanted
to
find
nordenskiold
and
patrick
to
fulfill
a
sacred
duty
while
he
discovered
perhaps
the
secret
of
his
birth
this
was
why
he
sought
untiringly
to
break
the
circle
of
ice
which
hemmed
them
in
he
made
excursions
with
his
sleigh
and
on
his
reconnoitered
in
every
direction
for
ten
days
but
it
was
all
in
vain
at
the
west
as
well
as
the
north
and
east
the
banks
of
ice
remained
firm
it
was
the
of
june
and
they
were
still
far
from
the
siberian
sea
must
he
confess
himself
vanquished
erik
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
do
this
repeated
soundings
had
revealed
that
under
the
ice
there
was
a
swift
current
running
toward
franklin
strait
that
is
to
say
toward
the
south
he
told
himself
that
some
effort
might
suffice
to
break
up
the
ice
and
he
resolved
to
attempt
it
for
the
length
of
seven
marine
miles
he
had
hollowed
in
the
ice
a
series
of
chambers
and
in
each
of
them
was
placed
a
kilogramme
of
dynamite
these
were
connected
by
a
copper
wire
inclosed
in
gutta
percha
on
the
of
june
at
eight
in
the
morning
erik
from
the
deck
of
the
alaska
pressed
the
button
of
the
electrical
machine
and
a
formidable
explosion
took
place
the
field
of
ice
shook
and
trembled
and
clouds
of
frightened
hovered
around
uttering
discordant
cries
when
silence
was
restored
a
long
black
train
cut
into
innumerable
fissures
met
their
anxious
gaze
the
explosion
of
the
terrible
agent
had
broken
up
the
ice
field
there
was
so
to
speak
a
moment
of
hesitation
and
then
the
ice
acted
as
if
it
had
only
been
waiting
for
some
signal
to
move
cracking
in
all
parts
it
yielded
to
the
action
of
the
current
and
they
beheld
here
and
there
whole
continents
as
it
were
gradually
moving
away
from
them
some
portions
however
were
more
slow
to
move
they
seemed
to
be
protesting
against
such
violence
the
next
day
the
passage
was
clear
and
the
alaska
rekindled
her
fires
erik
and
his
dynamite
had
done
what
it
would
probably
have
taken
the
pale
arctic
sun
a
month
longer
to
accomplish
on
the
of
july
the
expedition
arrived
at
banks
straits
on
the
fourth
she
issued
from
the
arctic
sea
properly
speaking
from
this
time
the
route
was
open
notwithstanding
icebergs
fogs
and
on
the
twelfth
the
alaska
doubled
ice
cape
on
the
thirteenth
cape
lisburne
and
on
the
fourteenth
she
entered
the
gulf
of
kotzebue
to
the
north
of
behring
straits
and
found
there
according
to
instructions
the
boat
loaded
with
coal
which
had
been
sent
from
san
francisco
thus
in
two
months
and
sixteen
days
they
had
accomplished
the
programme
arranged
by
erik
before
they
left
the
coast
of
france
the
alaska
had
hardly
ceased
to
move
when
erik
rushed
into
a
small
boat
and
hurried
off
to
accost
the
officer
who
had
charge
of
the
boat
loaded
with
coal
idem
said
he
as
he
approached
lisbon
answered
the
yankee
how
long
have
you
been
waiting
here
for
me
five
weeks
we
left
san
francisco
one
month
after
the
arrival
of
your
dispatch
have
you
heard
any
news
of
nordenskiold
at
san
francisco
they
had
not
received
any
reliable
information
about
him
but
since
i
have
been
here
i
have
spoken
to
several
captains
of
who
said
that
they
had
heard
from
the
natives
of
that
an
european
vessel
had
been
frozen
in
by
the
ice
for
nine
or
ten
months
they
thought
it
was
the
indeed
said
erik
with
a
joy
which
we
can
easily
understand
and
do
you
believe
that
it
has
not
yet
succeeded
in
getting
through
the
straits
i
am
sure
of
it
not
a
vessel
has
passed
us
for
the
last
five
weeks
which
i
have
not
seen
and
spoken
to
god
be
praised
our
troubles
will
not
be
without
recompense
if
we
succeed
in
finding
nordenskiold
you
will
not
be
the
first
who
has
done
so
said
the
yankee
with
an
ironical
smile
an
american
yacht
has
preceded
you
it
passed
here
three
days
ago
and
like
you
was
inquiring
for
nordenskiold
an
american
yacht
repeated
erik
half
stupefied
yes
the
captain
tudor
brown
from
vancouver
island
i
told
him
what
i
had
heard
and
he
immediately
started
for
cape
chapter
xvi
from
to
ljakow
tudor
brown
had
evidently
heard
of
the
change
in
the
route
of
the
alaska
he
had
reached
behring
straits
before
them
but
by
what
means
it
seemed
almost
supernatural
but
still
the
fact
remained
that
he
had
done
so
erik
was
greatly
depressed
by
this
information
but
he
concealed
his
feelings
from
his
friends
he
hurried
on
the
work
of
transporting
the
coal
and
set
out
again
without
losing
a
moment
is
a
long
situated
nearly
a
hundred
miles
to
the
west
of
behring
straits
and
from
the
pacific
visit
it
every
year
the
alaska
reached
there
after
a
voyage
of
hours
and
soon
in
the
bay
of
koljutschin
behind
a
wall
of
ice
they
discovered
the
masts
of
the
vega
which
had
been
frozen
in
for
nine
months
the
barrier
which
held
nordenskiold
captive
was
not
more
than
ten
kilometers
in
size
after
passing
around
it
the
alaska
came
to
anchor
in
a
little
creek
where
she
would
be
sheltered
from
the
northerly
winds
then
erik
with
his
three
friends
made
their
way
overland
to
the
establishment
which
the
vega
had
made
upon
the
siberian
coast
to
pass
this
long
winter
and
which
a
column
of
smoke
pointed
out
to
them
this
coast
of
the
bay
of
koljutschin
consists
of
a
low
and
slightly
undulating
plain
there
are
no
trees
only
some
dwarf
willows
marine
grasses
and
lichens
summer
had
already
brought
forth
some
plants
which
malarius
recognized
as
a
species
which
was
very
common
in
norway
the
encampment
of
the
vega
consisted
of
a
large
for
their
eatables
which
had
been
made
by
the
orders
of
nordenskiold
in
case
the
pressure
of
the
ice
should
destroy
his
ship
which
so
frequently
happens
on
these
dangerous
coasts
it
was
a
touching
fact
that
the
poor
population
although
always
half
starved
and
to
whom
this
depot
represented
incalculable
wealth
in
the
shape
of
food
had
respected
it
although
it
was
but
poorly
guarded
the
huts
of
skin
of
these
tschoutskes
were
grouped
here
and
there
around
the
station
the
most
imposing
structure
was
the
tintinjaranga
or
which
they
had
especially
arranged
to
use
for
a
magnetic
observatory
and
where
all
the
necessary
apparatus
had
been
placed
it
had
been
built
of
blocks
of
ice
delicately
tinted
and
cemented
together
with
snow
the
roof
of
planks
was
covered
with
cloth
the
voyagers
of
the
alaska
were
cordially
welcomed
by
the
young
astronomer
whom
they
found
at
the
time
of
their
arrival
holding
a
consultation
with
the
man
in
charge
of
the
he
offered
with
hearty
goodwill
to
take
them
on
board
the
vega
by
the
path
which
had
been
cut
in
the
ice
in
order
to
keep
open
the
means
of
communication
between
the
vessel
and
the
land
and
a
rope
attached
to
stones
served
as
a
guide
on
dark
nights
as
they
walked
he
related
to
them
their
adventures
since
they
had
been
unable
to
send
home
any
dispatches
after
leaving
the
mouth
of
the
lena
nordenskiold
had
directed
his
course
toward
the
islands
of
new
siberia
which
he
wished
to
explore
but
finding
it
almost
impossible
to
approach
them
on
account
of
the
ice
which
surrounded
them
and
the
shallowness
of
the
water
in
that
vicinity
he
abandoned
the
idea
and
resumed
his
course
toward
the
east
the
vega
encountered
no
great
difficulties
until
the
of
september
but
about
that
time
a
continuance
of
fogs
and
freezing
nights
compelled
her
to
slacken
her
speed
besides
the
darkness
necessitated
frequented
stoppages
it
was
therefore
the
of
september
before
she
reached
cape
they
cast
her
anchor
on
a
bank
of
ice
hoping
to
be
able
the
next
day
to
make
the
few
miles
which
separated
her
from
behring
straits
and
the
free
waters
of
the
pacific
but
a
north
wind
set
in
during
the
night
and
heaped
around
the
vessel
great
masses
of
ice
the
vega
found
herself
a
prisoner
for
the
winter
at
the
time
when
she
had
almost
accomplished
her
work
it
was
a
great
disappointment
to
us
as
you
can
imagine
said
the
young
astronomer
but
we
soon
rallied
our
forces
and
determined
to
profit
by
the
delay
as
much
as
possible
by
making
scientific
investigations
we
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
of
the
neighborhood
whom
no
traveler
has
hitherto
known
well
and
we
have
made
a
vocabulary
of
their
language
and
also
gathered
together
a
collection
of
their
arms
and
utensils
the
naturalists
of
the
have
also
been
diligent
and
added
many
new
arctic
plants
to
their
collection
lastly
the
end
of
the
expedition
has
been
accomplished
since
we
have
doubled
cape
tchelynskin
and
traversed
the
distance
between
it
and
the
mouth
of
the
yenisei
and
of
the
lena
henceforth
the
passage
must
become
a
recognized
fact
it
would
have
been
more
agreeable
for
us
if
we
could
have
effected
it
in
two
months
as
we
so
nearly
succeeded
in
doing
but
provided
we
are
not
blocked
in
much
longer
as
the
present
indications
lead
us
to
hope
we
will
not
have
much
to
complain
of
and
we
shall
be
able
to
return
with
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
we
have
accomplished
a
useful
work
while
listening
to
their
guide
with
deep
interest
the
travelers
were
pursuing
their
way
they
were
now
near
enough
to
the
vega
to
see
that
her
deck
was
covered
over
with
a
large
canvas
and
that
her
sides
were
protected
by
lofty
masses
of
snow
and
that
her
had
been
carefully
preserved
from
contact
with
the
ice
the
immediate
approach
to
the
vessel
was
still
more
strange
she
was
not
as
one
would
have
expected
completely
incrusted
in
a
bed
of
ice
but
she
was
suspended
as
it
were
in
a
labyrinth
of
lakes
islands
and
canals
between
which
they
had
been
obliged
to
throw
bridges
formed
of
planks
the
explanation
is
very
simple
said
the
young
astronomer
in
reply
to
a
question
from
erik
all
vessels
that
pass
some
months
surrounded
by
ice
form
around
them
a
bed
of
refuse
consisting
principally
of
coal
ashes
this
is
heavier
than
snow
and
when
a
thaw
begins
the
bed
around
the
vessel
assumes
the
aspect
which
you
behold
the
crew
of
the
vega
in
arctic
clothing
with
two
or
three
officers
had
already
seen
the
visitors
whom
the
astronomer
was
bringing
with
him
their
joy
was
great
when
they
saluted
them
in
swedish
and
when
they
beheld
among
them
the
and
popular
physiognomy
of
schwaryencrona
neither
nordenskiold
nor
captain
palender
were
on
board
they
had
gone
upon
a
geological
excursion
into
the
interior
of
the
country
and
expected
to
be
absent
five
or
six
days
this
was
a
disappointment
to
the
travelers
who
had
naturally
hoped
when
they
found
the
vega
to
present
their
congratulations
to
the
great
explorer
but
this
was
not
their
only
disappointment
footnote
they
returned
sooner
for
on
the
of
july
the
ice
broke
up
and
after
days
of
captivity
the
vega
resumed
her
voyage
on
the
of
july
she
issued
from
behring
straits
and
set
out
for
yokohama
they
had
hardly
entered
the
officer
room
when
erik
and
his
friends
were
informed
that
three
days
before
the
vega
had
been
visited
by
an
american
yacht
or
rather
by
its
owner
tudor
brown
this
gentleman
had
brought
them
news
of
the
world
beyond
their
settlement
which
was
very
acceptable
they
being
confined
to
the
limited
neighborhood
of
the
bay
of
koljutschin
he
told
them
what
had
happened
in
europe
since
their
departure
the
anxiety
that
sweden
and
indeed
all
civilized
nations
felt
about
their
fate
and
that
the
alaska
had
been
sent
to
search
for
them
tudor
brown
came
from
vancouver
island
in
the
pacific
and
his
yacht
had
been
waiting
there
for
him
for
three
months
but
exclaimed
a
young
doctor
attached
to
the
expedition
he
told
us
that
he
had
at
first
embarked
with
you
and
only
left
you
at
brest
because
he
doubted
whether
you
would
be
able
to
bring
the
enterprise
to
a
successful
termination
he
had
excellent
reasons
for
doubting
it
replied
erik
coolly
but
not
without
a
secret
tremor
his
yacht
was
at
valparaiso
and
he
telegraphed
for
her
to
wait
for
him
at
victoria
on
the
coast
of
vancouver
continued
the
doctor
then
he
took
the
steamer
from
liverpool
to
new
york
and
the
railroad
to
the
pacific
this
explains
how
he
was
able
to
reach
here
before
you
did
he
tell
you
why
he
came
asked
bredejord
he
came
to
help
us
if
we
stood
in
need
of
assistance
and
also
to
inquire
about
a
strange
enough
personage
whom
i
had
incidentally
mentioned
in
my
correspondence
and
in
whom
tudor
brown
seemed
to
take
a
great
interest
the
four
visitors
exchanged
glances
patrick
was
not
that
the
name
asked
erik
precisely
or
at
least
it
is
the
name
which
is
tattooed
on
his
body
although
he
pretends
it
is
not
his
own
but
that
of
a
friend
he
calls
himself
johnny
bowles
may
i
ask
if
this
man
is
still
here
he
left
us
ten
months
ago
we
had
at
first
believed
that
he
might
prove
useful
to
us
by
acting
as
interpreter
between
us
and
the
natives
of
this
coast
on
account
of
his
apparent
knowledge
of
their
language
but
we
soon
discovered
that
his
acquaintance
with
it
was
very
superficial
confined
in
fact
to
a
few
words
besides
until
we
came
here
we
were
unable
to
hold
any
communications
with
the
natives
this
johnny
bowles
or
patrick
was
lazy
drunken
and
undisciplined
his
presence
on
board
would
only
have
occasioned
trouble
for
us
we
therefore
acceded
without
regret
to
his
request
to
be
landed
on
the
large
island
of
ljakow
as
we
were
following
the
southern
coast
what
did
he
go
there
but
this
island
is
uninhabited
cried
erik
entirely
but
what
attracted
the
man
appeared
to
be
the
fact
that
its
shores
are
literally
covered
by
bones
and
consequently
by
fossil
ivory
he
had
conceived
the
plan
of
establishing
himself
there
and
of
collecting
during
the
summer
months
all
the
ivory
that
he
could
find
then
when
in
winter
the
arm
of
the
sea
which
connects
ljakow
with
the
continent
should
be
frozen
over
to
transport
in
a
sleigh
this
treasure
to
the
siberian
coast
in
order
to
sell
it
to
the
russian
traders
who
come
every
year
in
search
of
the
products
of
the
country
did
you
tell
these
facts
to
tudor
brown
asked
erik
assuredly
he
came
far
enough
to
seek
for
them
replied
the
young
doctor
unaware
of
the
deep
personal
interest
that
the
commander
of
the
alaska
took
in
the
answers
to
the
questions
which
he
addressed
to
him
the
conversation
then
became
more
general
they
spoke
of
the
comparative
facility
with
which
nordenskiold
had
carried
out
his
programme
he
had
not
met
with
any
serious
difficulties
and
consequently
the
discovery
of
the
new
route
would
be
an
advantage
to
the
commerce
of
the
world
not
said
the
officer
of
the
vega
that
this
path
was
ever
destined
to
be
much
frequented
but
the
voyage
of
the
would
prove
to
the
maritime
nations
of
the
atlantic
and
pacific
that
it
was
possible
to
hold
direct
communication
with
siberia
by
water
and
nowhere
would
these
nations
notwithstanding
the
vulgar
opinions
find
a
field
as
vast
and
rich
is
it
not
strange
observed
bredejord
that
they
have
failed
completely
during
the
last
three
centuries
in
this
attempt
that
you
have
now
accomplished
without
difficulty
the
singularity
is
only
apparent
answered
one
of
the
officers
we
have
profited
by
the
experience
of
our
predecessors
an
experience
often
only
acquired
at
the
cost
of
their
lives
professor
nordenskiold
has
been
preparing
himself
for
this
supreme
effort
during
the
last
twenty
years
in
which
he
has
made
eight
arctic
expeditions
he
has
patiently
studied
the
problem
in
all
its
aspects
and
finally
succeeded
in
solving
it
then
we
have
had
what
our
predecessors
lacked
a
steam
vessel
especially
equipped
for
this
voyage
this
has
enabled
us
to
accomplish
in
two
months
a
voyage
that
it
would
have
taken
a
sailing
vessel
two
years
to
do
we
have
also
constantly
been
able
not
only
to
choose
but
also
to
seek
out
the
most
accessible
route
we
have
fled
from
floating
ice
and
been
able
to
profit
by
the
winds
and
tides
and
still
we
have
been
overtaken
by
winter
how
much
more
difficult
it
would
have
been
for
a
mariner
who
was
compelled
to
wait
for
favorable
winds
and
see
the
summer
passing
in
the
meantime
in
such
conversation
they
passed
the
afternoon
and
after
accepting
their
invitation
and
dining
on
board
the
vega
they
carried
back
with
them
to
supper
on
board
the
alaska
all
the
officers
who
could
be
spared
from
duty
they
mutually
gave
each
other
all
the
information
and
news
in
their
power
erik
took
care
to
inform
himself
exactly
of
the
route
followed
by
the
vega
in
order
to
utilize
it
for
his
own
profit
after
exchanging
many
good
wishes
and
with
the
heartfelt
desire
that
they
would
all
soon
return
in
safety
to
their
country
they
separated
the
next
day
at
dawn
erik
had
the
alaska
steering
for
the
island
of
ljakow
as
for
the
vega
she
had
to
wait
until
the
breaking
up
of
the
ice
would
permit
her
to
reach
the
pacific
the
first
part
of
erik
task
was
now
accomplished
he
had
found
nordenskiold
the
second
still
remained
to
be
fulfilled
to
find
patrick
and
see
if
he
could
persuade
him
to
disclose
his
secret
that
this
secret
was
an
important
one
they
were
now
all
willing
to
admit
or
tudor
brown
would
never
have
committed
such
a
dastardly
crime
to
prevent
them
from
becoming
acquainted
with
it
would
they
be
able
to
reach
the
island
of
ljakow
before
him
it
was
hardly
probable
for
he
was
three
days
in
advance
of
them
never
mind
he
would
make
the
attempt
the
albatross
might
lose
her
way
or
meet
with
some
unforeseen
obstacles
as
long
as
there
was
even
a
probability
of
success
erik
determined
to
take
the
chances
the
weather
was
now
mild
and
agreeable
light
fogs
indicated
an
open
sea
and
a
speedy
breaking
of
the
ice
along
the
siberian
coast
where
the
vega
had
been
held
prisoner
so
long
summer
was
advancing
and
the
alaska
could
reasonably
count
upon
at
least
ten
weeks
of
favorable
weather
the
experience
which
they
had
acquired
amongst
the
american
ice
had
its
value
and
would
render
this
new
enterprise
comparatively
easy
lastly
the
passage
was
the
most
direct
way
to
return
to
sweden
and
besides
the
deep
personal
interest
which
induced
erik
to
take
it
he
had
a
truly
scientific
desire
to
accomplish
in
a
reverse
route
the
task
which
nordenskiold
had
fulfilled
if
he
had
succeeded
why
should
he
not
be
able
to
do
so
this
would
be
proving
practically
the
experiment
of
the
great
navigator
the
wind
favored
the
alaska
for
ten
days
it
blew
almost
constantly
from
the
and
enabled
them
to
make
from
nine
to
ten
knots
at
least
without
burning
any
coal
this
was
a
precious
advantage
and
besides
the
wind
drove
the
floating
ice
toward
the
north
and
rendered
navigation
much
less
difficult
during
these
ten
days
they
met
with
very
little
floating
ice
on
the
eleventh
day
it
is
true
they
had
a
tempestuous
snow
storm
followed
by
dense
fogs
which
sensibly
retarded
the
progress
of
the
alaska
but
on
the
of
july
the
sun
appeared
in
all
its
brilliancy
and
on
the
morning
of
the
of
august
they
came
in
sight
of
the
island
of
ljakow
erik
gave
orders
immediately
to
sail
around
it
in
order
to
see
if
the
albatross
was
not
hidden
in
some
of
its
creeks
having
done
this
they
cast
anchor
in
a
sandy
bottom
about
three
miles
from
the
southern
shore
then
he
embarked
in
his
boat
accompanied
by
his
three
friends
and
six
of
his
sailors
half
an
hour
later
they
had
reached
the
island
erik
had
not
chosen
the
southern
coast
of
the
island
to
anchor
his
vessel
without
a
reason
he
had
said
to
himself
that
patrick
might
have
told
the
truth
when
he
had
stated
that
his
object
was
to
collect
ivory
but
if
it
was
his
intention
to
leave
the
island
at
the
first
opportunity
which
afforded
he
would
be
sure
to
establish
himself
upon
a
spot
where
he
would
have
a
good
view
of
the
sea
he
would
undoubtedly
choose
some
elevated
place
and
one
as
near
as
possible
to
the
siberian
coast
besides
the
necessity
of
sheltering
himself
against
the
polar
winds
would
lead
him
to
establish
himself
upon
the
southern
coast
of
the
island
erik
did
not
pretend
that
his
conclusions
were
necessarily
incontrovertible
but
he
thought
that
in
any
case
they
would
suffer
no
inconvenience
from
adopting
them
as
the
basis
of
a
systematic
exploration
of
the
place
the
results
fully
justified
his
expectations
the
travelers
had
not
walked
along
the
shore
for
an
hour
when
they
perceived
on
a
height
perfectly
sheltered
by
a
chain
of
hills
facing
the
south
an
object
which
could
only
be
a
human
habitation
to
their
extreme
surprise
this
little
cottage
which
was
of
a
cubical
form
was
perfectly
white
as
if
it
had
been
covered
with
plaster
it
only
lacked
green
shutters
to
perfectly
resemble
a
country
home
near
marseilles
or
an
american
cottage
after
they
had
climbed
the
height
and
approached
near
to
it
they
discovered
a
solution
of
the
mystery
the
cottage
was
not
plastered
it
was
simply
built
of
enormous
bones
skillfully
arranged
which
gave
it
its
white
color
strange
as
the
materials
were
they
were
forced
to
admit
that
the
idea
of
utilizing
them
was
a
natural
one
besides
there
was
nothing
else
available
on
the
island
where
vegetation
was
most
meagre
but
the
whole
place
even
the
neighboring
hills
were
covered
with
bones
which
schwaryencrona
recognized
as
the
remains
of
wild
beasts
chapter
xvii
at
last
the
door
of
the
cottage
was
open
the
visitors
entered
and
saw
at
a
glance
that
the
single
room
of
which
it
consisted
was
empty
although
it
had
been
recently
occupied
upon
the
hearth
which
was
built
of
three
large
stones
lay
some
extinguished
embers
upon
which
the
light
ashes
still
lingered
although
the
lightest
breeze
would
have
been
sufficient
to
carry
them
away
the
bed
consisting
of
a
wooden
frame
from
which
was
suspended
a
sailor
hammock
still
bore
the
impress
of
a
human
figure
this
hammock
that
erik
examined
immediately
bore
the
stamp
of
the
vega
on
a
sort
of
table
formed
from
the
of
some
animal
and
supported
by
four
thigh
bones
lay
some
crumbs
of
ship
biscuit
a
pewter
goblet
and
a
wooden
spoon
of
swedish
workmanship
they
could
not
doubt
that
they
were
in
the
of
patrick
and
according
to
all
appearances
he
had
only
left
it
a
short
time
ago
had
he
quitted
the
island
or
had
he
only
gone
to
take
a
walk
the
only
thing
they
could
do
was
to
make
a
thorough
exploration
of
the
island
around
the
habitation
excavations
bore
witness
to
the
fact
that
a
great
amount
of
hard
work
had
been
done
on
a
sort
of
plateau
that
formed
the
summit
of
the
hill
a
great
quantity
of
ivory
had
been
piled
up
and
indicated
the
nature
of
the
work
the
voyagers
perceived
that
all
the
skeletons
of
elephants
and
other
animals
had
been
despoiled
of
their
ivory
and
they
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
the
natives
of
the
siberian
coast
had
been
aware
long
before
the
visit
of
patrick
of
the
treasure
which
was
to
be
found
upon
the
island
and
had
come
and
carried
off
large
quantities
of
it
the
irishman
therefore
had
not
found
the
quantity
of
ivory
upon
the
surface
of
the
ground
which
he
had
expected
and
had
been
compelled
to
make
excavations
and
exhume
it
the
quality
of
this
ivory
which
had
been
buried
probably
for
a
long
time
appeared
to
the
travelers
to
be
of
a
very
inferior
quality
now
the
young
doctor
of
the
vega
had
told
them
as
had
the
proprietor
of
the
red
anchor
in
brooklyn
that
laziness
was
one
of
the
distinguishing
characteristics
of
patrick
it
therefore
seemed
to
them
very
improbable
that
he
would
be
resigned
to
follow
such
a
laborious
and
unremunerative
life
they
therefore
felt
sure
that
he
would
embrace
the
first
opportunity
to
leave
the
island
of
ljakow
the
only
hope
that
still
remained
of
finding
him
there
was
that
which
the
examination
of
his
cabin
had
furnished
them
a
path
descended
to
the
shore
opposite
to
that
by
which
our
explorers
had
climbed
up
they
followed
it
and
soon
reached
the
bottom
where
the
melting
snows
had
formed
a
sort
of
little
lake
separated
from
the
sea
by
a
wall
of
rocks
the
path
followed
the
shores
of
this
quiet
water
and
going
around
the
cliff
they
found
a
natural
harbor
they
saw
a
sleigh
abandoned
on
the
land
and
also
traces
of
a
recent
fire
erik
examined
the
shore
carefully
but
could
find
no
traces
of
any
recent
embarkation
he
was
returning
to
his
companions
when
he
perceived
at
the
foot
of
a
shrub
a
red
object
which
he
picked
up
immediately
it
was
one
of
those
tin
boxes
painted
outside
with
carmine
which
had
contained
that
preserved
beef
commonly
called
endaubage
and
which
all
vessels
carry
among
their
provisions
it
was
not
so
great
a
prize
since
the
captain
of
the
vega
had
supplied
patrick
with
food
but
what
struck
erik
as
significant
was
the
fact
that
there
was
printed
on
the
empty
box
the
name
of
martinez
domingo
valparaiso
tudor
brown
has
been
here
he
cried
they
told
us
on
board
the
that
his
vessel
was
at
valparaiso
when
he
telegraphed
them
to
wait
for
him
at
vancouver
besides
this
box
from
chili
could
not
have
been
brought
here
by
the
for
it
is
evidently
quite
fresh
it
can
not
be
three
days
perhaps
not
hours
since
it
has
been
opened
schwaryencrona
and
bredejord
shook
their
heads
as
if
they
hesitated
to
accept
erik
conclusions
when
turning
the
box
in
his
hands
he
descried
written
in
pencil
the
word
albatross
which
had
doubtless
been
done
by
the
person
who
had
furnished
the
vessel
with
the
beef
he
pointed
it
out
to
his
friends
tudor
brown
has
been
here
he
repeated
and
why
should
he
come
except
to
carry
off
patrick
let
us
go
it
is
evident
they
embarked
at
this
creek
his
men
while
they
were
waiting
for
him
have
taken
breakfast
around
this
fire
he
has
carried
off
the
irishman
either
willingly
or
unwillingly
i
am
as
certain
of
it
as
if
i
saw
them
embark
notwithstanding
this
firm
belief
erik
carefully
explored
the
neighborhood
to
assure
himself
that
patrick
was
no
longer
there
an
hour
walk
convinced
him
that
the
island
was
uninhabited
there
was
no
trace
of
a
path
nor
the
least
vestige
of
a
human
being
on
all
sides
valleys
extended
as
far
as
his
sight
could
reach
without
even
a
bird
to
animate
its
solitude
and
above
all
the
gigantic
bones
which
they
beheld
lying
around
in
every
direction
gave
them
a
feeling
of
disgust
it
seemed
as
if
an
army
of
animals
had
taken
refuge
in
this
solitary
island
only
to
die
there
let
us
go
said
schwaryencrona
there
is
no
use
in
making
a
more
complete
search
of
the
island
we
have
seen
sufficient
to
assure
us
that
patrick
would
not
require
much
urging
to
induce
him
to
leave
this
place
four
hours
later
they
were
again
on
board
of
the
alaska
and
continuing
their
journey
erik
did
not
hide
the
fact
that
his
hopes
had
received
a
severe
check
tudor
brown
had
been
ahead
of
him
he
had
succeeded
in
reaching
the
island
first
and
doubtless
had
carried
off
patrick
it
was
therefore
hardly
probable
that
they
would
succeed
in
finding
him
again
a
man
capable
of
displaying
such
ability
in
his
fiendish
attack
upon
the
alaska
and
who
could
adopt
such
energetic
measures
to
carry
off
the
irishman
from
such
a
place
would
assuredly
exert
himself
to
the
utmost
to
prevent
them
from
ever
coming
in
contact
with
him
the
world
is
large
and
its
waters
were
open
to
the
albatross
who
could
tell
to
what
point
of
the
compass
patrick
and
his
secret
would
be
carried
this
is
what
the
captain
of
the
alaska
said
to
himself
as
he
walked
the
deck
of
his
vessel
after
giving
orders
to
steer
to
the
westward
and
to
these
doleful
thoughts
was
added
a
feeling
of
remorse
that
he
had
permitted
his
friends
to
share
the
dangers
and
fatigue
of
his
useless
expedition
it
was
doubly
useless
since
tudor
brown
had
found
nordenskiold
before
the
alaska
and
also
preceded
them
to
the
island
of
ljakow
they
must
then
return
to
stockholm
if
they
ever
succeeded
in
reaching
it
without
having
accomplished
one
of
the
objects
of
the
expedition
it
was
indeed
a
great
disappointment
but
at
least
their
returning
in
a
contrary
direction
to
the
vega
would
prove
the
feasibility
of
the
northeast
passage
at
any
risk
he
must
reach
cape
tchelynskin
and
double
it
from
east
to
west
at
any
risk
he
must
return
to
sweden
by
way
of
the
sea
of
kara
it
was
this
redoubtable
cape
tchelynskin
formerly
considered
impassable
that
the
alaska
crowded
on
steam
to
reach
they
did
not
follow
the
exact
route
of
the
vega
for
erik
had
no
occasion
to
descend
the
siberian
coast
leaving
to
starboard
the
islands
of
stolbovvi
and
semenoffski
which
they
sighted
on
the
of
august
they
sailed
due
west
following
closely
the
degree
of
latitude
and
made
such
good
speed
that
in
eight
days
they
had
made
degrees
of
longitude
from
the
to
the
degree
east
of
greenwich
it
is
true
that
they
had
to
burn
a
great
deal
of
coal
to
accomplish
this
for
the
alaska
had
had
contrary
winds
almost
all
the
time
but
erik
thought
rightly
that
everything
was
subordinate
to
the
necessity
of
making
their
way
out
of
these
dangerous
passes
as
speedily
as
possible
if
they
could
once
reach
the
mouth
of
the
yenisei
they
could
always
procure
the
necessary
fuel
on
the
of
august
at
midday
they
were
unable
to
make
a
solar
observation
on
account
of
a
thick
fog
which
covered
the
whole
sky
but
they
knew
that
they
were
approaching
a
great
asiatic
promontory
therefore
erik
advanced
with
extreme
caution
while
at
the
same
time
he
had
the
speed
of
the
vessel
slackened
toward
night
he
gave
orders
to
have
the
vessel
stopped
these
precautions
were
not
useless
the
following
morning
at
daylight
they
made
soundings
and
found
that
they
were
in
only
thirty
fathoms
of
water
and
an
hour
afterward
they
came
in
sight
of
land
and
the
alaska
soon
reached
a
bay
in
which
she
could
cast
anchor
they
resolved
to
wait
until
the
fog
dispersed
before
going
on
land
but
as
the
and
of
august
passed
without
bringing
about
this
desired
result
erik
determined
to
start
accompanied
by
bredejord
malarius
and
the
doctor
a
short
examination
showed
them
that
the
alaska
was
at
the
extreme
north
of
the
two
points
of
cape
tchelynskin
on
two
sides
the
land
lay
low
toward
the
sea
but
it
rose
gradually
toward
the
south
and
they
perceived
that
it
was
about
two
or
three
hundred
feet
in
height
no
snow
or
ice
was
to
be
seen
in
any
direction
except
along
the
borders
of
the
sea
where
there
was
a
little
band
such
as
is
commonly
seen
in
all
arctic
regions
the
clayey
soil
was
covered
with
abundant
vegetation
consisting
of
mossy
grasses
and
lichens
the
coast
was
enlivened
by
great
numbers
of
wild
geese
and
walruses
a
white
bear
displayed
himself
on
top
of
a
rock
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
fog
which
cast
a
gray
mantle
over
everything
the
general
aspect
of
this
famous
cape
tchelynskin
was
not
particularly
disagreeable
certainly
there
was
nothing
to
justify
the
name
of
cape
severe
which
it
had
borne
for
three
centuries
as
they
advanced
to
the
extreme
point
at
the
west
of
the
bay
the
travelers
perceived
a
sort
of
monument
that
crowned
a
height
and
naturally
pressed
forward
to
visit
it
they
saw
as
they
approached
that
it
was
a
sort
of
cairn
or
mass
of
stones
supporting
a
wooden
column
made
out
of
a
post
this
column
bore
two
inscriptions
the
first
read
as
follows
on
the
of
august
the
left
the
atlantic
to
double
cape
tchelynskin
for
behring
straits
the
second
read
on
the
of
august
the
coming
from
behring
straits
doubled
cape
tchelynskin
for
the
atlantic
once
again
tudor
brown
had
preceded
the
alaska
it
was
now
the
of
august
he
had
written
this
inscription
only
four
days
previously
in
erik
eyes
it
appeared
cruel
and
ironical
it
seemed
to
him
to
say
i
will
defeat
you
at
every
turn
all
your
efforts
will
be
useless
nordenskiold
has
solved
the
problem
tudor
brown
the
counter
proof
as
for
himself
he
would
return
humiliated
and
ashamed
without
having
demonstrated
found
or
proved
anything
he
was
going
without
adding
a
single
word
to
the
inscriptions
on
the
column
but
schwaryencrona
would
not
listen
to
him
and
taking
out
his
knife
from
his
pocket
he
wrote
on
the
bottom
of
the
post
these
words
on
the
of
august
the
left
stockholm
and
came
here
across
the
atlantic
and
the
siberian
sea
and
has
doubled
cape
tchelynskin
to
accomplish
the
first
circumpolar
periplus
there
is
a
strange
power
in
words
this
simple
phrase
recalled
to
erik
what
a
geographical
feat
he
was
in
hopes
of
accomplishing
and
without
his
being
conscious
of
it
restored
him
to
good
humor
it
was
true
after
all
that
the
alaska
would
be
the
first
vessel
to
accomplish
this
voyage
other
navigators
before
him
had
sailed
through
the
seas
and
accomplished
the
northwest
passage
nordenskiold
and
tudor
brown
had
doubled
cape
tchelynskin
but
no
person
had
as
yet
gone
from
one
to
the
other
completely
around
the
pole
completing
the
three
hundred
and
sixty
degrees
this
prospect
restored
every
one
ardor
and
they
were
eager
to
depart
erik
thought
it
best
however
to
wait
until
the
next
day
and
see
if
the
fog
would
lift
but
fogs
appeared
to
be
the
chronic
malady
of
cape
tchelynskin
and
when
next
morning
the
sun
rose
without
dissipating
it
he
gave
orders
to
hoist
the
anchor
leaving
to
the
south
the
gulf
of
taymis
which
is
also
the
name
of
the
great
siberian
peninsula
of
which
cape
tchelynskin
forms
the
extreme
point
the
alaska
directing
her
course
westward
sailed
uninterruptedly
during
the
day
and
night
of
the
of
august
on
the
eighteenth
at
the
fog
disappeared
at
last
and
the
atmosphere
was
pure
and
enlivened
by
the
sunshine
by
midday
they
had
rounded
the
point
and
immediately
descried
a
distant
sail
to
the
the
presence
of
a
in
these
unfrequented
seas
was
too
extraordinary
a
phenomenon
not
to
attract
special
attention
erik
with
his
glass
in
his
hand
ascended
to
the
lookout
and
examined
the
vessel
carefully
for
a
long
time
it
appeared
to
lie
low
in
the
water
was
rigged
like
a
schooner
and
had
a
although
he
could
not
perceive
any
smoke
when
he
descended
from
the
bridge
the
young
captain
said
to
the
doctor
it
looks
exactly
like
the
then
he
gave
orders
to
put
on
all
steam
possible
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
saw
that
they
were
gaining
on
the
vessel
whose
appointments
they
were
now
able
to
discern
with
the
naked
eye
they
could
see
that
the
breeze
had
slackened
and
that
her
course
was
at
right
angles
with
that
of
the
alaska
but
suddenly
a
change
took
place
in
the
distant
vessel
clouds
of
smoke
issued
from
her
and
formed
behind
her
a
long
black
cloud
she
was
now
going
by
steam
and
in
the
same
direction
as
the
alaska
there
is
now
no
doubt
of
it
it
is
the
said
erik
he
gave
orders
to
the
engineer
to
increase
the
speed
of
the
alaska
if
possible
they
were
then
making
fourteen
knots
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
they
were
making
sixteen
knots
the
vessel
that
they
were
pursuing
had
not
been
able
to
attain
a
like
rate
of
speed
for
the
alaska
continued
to
gain
upon
her
in
thirty
minutes
they
were
near
enough
to
her
to
distinguish
all
her
men
who
were
maneuvering
her
at
last
they
could
see
the
moldings
and
letters
forming
her
name
albatross
erik
gave
orders
to
hoist
the
swedish
flag
the
albatross
immediately
hoisted
the
stars
and
stripes
of
the
united
states
of
america
in
a
few
minutes
the
two
vessels
were
only
separated
by
a
few
hundred
yards
then
the
captain
of
the
alaska
took
his
and
hailed
the
vessel
in
english
ship
ahoy
i
wish
to
speak
with
your
captain
in
a
few
moments
some
one
made
his
appearance
on
the
bridge
of
the
albatross
it
was
tudor
brown
i
am
the
proprietor
and
captain
of
this
yacht
he
said
what
do
you
want
i
wish
to
know
whether
patrick
is
on
board
patrick
is
on
board
and
can
speak
for
himself
answered
tudor
brown
he
made
a
sign
and
a
man
joined
him
on
the
bridge
this
is
patrick
said
tudor
brown
what
do
you
want
with
him
erik
was
desirous
of
this
interview
so
long
he
had
come
so
far
in
search
of
this
man
that
when
he
found
himself
unexpectedly
in
his
presence
and
recognized
him
by
his
red
hair
and
broken
nose
he
was
at
first
taken
aback
and
scarcely
knew
what
to
say
to
him
but
gathering
his
ideas
together
he
at
last
made
an
attempt
i
have
been
wishing
to
talk
to
you
confidentially
for
several
years
he
said
i
have
been
seeking
for
you
and
it
was
to
find
you
that
i
came
into
these
seas
will
you
come
on
board
of
my
vessel
i
do
not
know
you
and
i
am
very
well
satisfied
to
stay
where
i
am
answered
the
man
but
i
know
you
i
have
heard
through
bowles
that
you
were
on
board
when
the
was
wrecked
and
that
you
had
spoken
to
him
about
the
infant
who
was
tied
to
a
buoy
i
am
that
infant
and
it
is
about
this
matter
that
i
wish
you
to
give
me
all
the
information
in
your
power
you
must
question
somebody
else
for
i
am
not
in
the
humor
to
give
any
do
you
wish
me
to
suppose
that
the
information
is
not
to
your
credit
you
can
think
what
you
like
it
is
a
matter
of
perfect
indifference
to
me
said
the
man
erik
resolved
to
betray
no
irritation
it
would
be
better
for
you
to
tell
me
what
i
wish
to
know
of
your
own
free
will
than
to
be
compelled
to
do
so
before
a
court
of
justice
he
said
coolly
a
court
of
justice
they
will
have
to
catch
me
first
answered
the
other
mockingly
here
tudor
brown
interposed
you
see
it
is
not
my
fault
if
you
have
not
obtained
the
information
that
you
desired
said
he
to
erik
the
best
thing
is
now
for
us
both
to
resume
our
course
and
go
where
we
desire
why
should
we
each
go
our
way
answered
the
young
captain
would
it
not
be
better
for
us
to
keep
together
until
we
reach
some
civilized
country
where
we
can
settle
these
matters
i
have
no
business
with
you
and
do
not
want
any
one
company
answered
tudor
brown
moving
as
if
he
was
about
to
leave
the
bridge
erik
stopped
him
by
a
sign
proprietor
of
the
he
said
i
bear
a
regular
commission
from
my
government
and
am
besides
an
officer
of
the
maritime
police
i
therefore
ask
you
to
show
me
your
papers
immediately
tudor
brown
did
not
make
the
slightest
answer
but
descended
the
bridge
with
the
man
whom
he
had
called
erik
waited
a
couple
of
minutes
and
then
he
spoke
again
commander
of
the
i
accuse
you
of
having
attempted
to
shipwreck
my
vessel
on
the
rocks
of
sein
and
i
now
summon
you
to
come
and
answer
this
accusation
before
a
marine
tribunal
if
you
refuse
to
answer
this
summons
it
will
be
my
duty
to
compel
you
to
do
so
try
it
if
you
like
cried
tudor
brown
and
gave
orders
to
resume
his
journey
during
this
colloquy
his
vessel
had
insensibly
tacked
and
now
stood
at
right
angles
with
the
alaska
suddenly
the
wheel
commenced
to
revolve
and
beat
the
water
which
boiled
and
foamed
around
it
a
prolonged
whistle
was
heard
and
the
albatross
carrying
all
the
steam
she
could
raise
sped
over
the
waters
in
the
direction
of
the
north
pole
two
minutes
later
the
alaska
was
rushing
after
her
chapter
xviii
at
the
same
time
that
he
gave
orders
to
pursue
the
albatross
erik
also
desired
his
men
to
get
the
cannon
in
readiness
the
operation
took
some
time
and
when
they
had
everything
in
order
the
enemy
was
beyond
their
reach
doubtless
they
had
taken
advantage
of
the
time
occupied
by
their
stoppage
to
increase
their
fires
and
they
were
two
or
three
miles
ahead
this
was
not
too
great
a
distance
for
a
gatling
gun
to
carry
but
the
rolling
and
speed
of
the
two
vessels
made
it
probable
that
they
would
miss
her
and
they
thought
it
better
to
wait
hoping
that
the
alaska
would
gain
upon
the
enemy
it
soon
became
evident
however
that
the
two
vessels
were
equally
matched
for
the
distance
between
them
remained
about
the
same
for
several
hours
they
were
obliged
to
burn
an
enormous
amount
of
coal
an
article
which
was
becoming
very
scarce
on
board
the
alaska
and
this
would
be
a
heavy
loss
if
they
could
not
succeed
in
overtaking
the
albatross
before
night
set
in
erik
did
not
think
it
right
to
do
this
without
consulting
his
crew
he
therefore
mounted
the
bridge
and
frankly
explained
to
them
the
position
in
which
he
was
placed
my
friends
he
said
you
know
that
i
am
anxious
to
seize
and
deliver
up
to
justice
this
rascal
who
attempted
to
shipwreck
our
vessel
on
the
rocks
of
sein
but
we
have
hardly
coal
enough
left
to
last
us
for
six
days
any
deviation
from
our
route
will
compel
us
to
finish
our
voyage
under
sail
which
may
make
it
very
long
and
toilsome
for
all
of
us
and
may
even
cause
us
to
fail
in
our
undertaking
on
the
other
hand
the
counts
upon
being
able
to
get
away
from
us
during
the
night
to
prevent
this
we
must
not
slacken
our
speed
for
a
moment
and
we
must
keep
her
within
the
range
of
our
electric
light
i
feel
sure
however
that
we
will
eventually
overtake
her
but
it
may
take
us
some
time
to
do
so
i
did
not
feel
willing
to
continue
this
pursuit
without
laying
the
facts
plainly
before
you
and
asking
you
if
you
were
willing
to
risk
the
dangers
which
may
arise
for
us
the
men
consulted
together
in
a
low
tone
and
then
commissioned
hersebom
to
speak
for
them
we
are
of
opinion
that
it
is
the
duty
of
the
to
capture
this
rascal
at
any
sacrifice
he
said
quietly
very
well
then
we
will
do
our
best
to
accomplish
it
answered
erik
when
he
found
that
he
had
the
confidence
of
his
crew
he
did
not
spare
fuel
and
in
spite
of
the
desperate
efforts
of
tudor
brown
he
could
not
increase
the
distance
between
them
the
sun
had
scarcely
set
when
the
electric
light
of
the
alaska
was
brought
to
bear
unpityingly
upon
the
albatross
and
continued
in
this
position
during
the
night
at
the
distance
between
them
was
still
the
same
and
they
were
flying
toward
the
pole
at
midday
they
made
a
solar
observation
and
found
that
they
were
in
of
latitude
north
by
of
longitude
east
floating
ice
which
they
had
not
encountered
for
ten
or
fifteen
days
now
became
very
frequent
it
was
necessary
to
ward
it
off
as
they
had
been
compelled
to
do
in
baffin
bay
erik
feeling
sure
that
they
would
soon
reach
fields
of
ice
was
careful
to
steer
obliquely
to
the
right
of
the
albatross
so
as
to
bar
the
way
toward
the
east
if
she
should
attempt
to
change
her
course
finding
her
path
toward
the
north
obstructed
his
foresight
was
soon
rewarded
for
in
two
hours
a
lofty
barrier
of
ice
casts
its
profile
on
the
horizon
the
american
yacht
immediately
steered
toward
the
west
leaving
the
ice
two
or
three
miles
on
its
starboard
the
alaska
immediately
imitated
this
maneuver
but
so
obliquely
to
the
left
of
the
albatross
as
to
cut
her
off
if
she
attempted
to
sail
to
the
south
the
chase
became
very
exciting
feeling
sure
of
the
course
which
the
albatross
would
be
compelled
to
take
the
alaska
tried
to
push
her
more
toward
the
ice
the
yacht
course
becomes
more
and
more
wavering
every
moment
they
made
some
change
at
one
time
steering
north
at
another
west
erik
mounted
aloft
watched
every
movement
she
made
and
thwarted
her
attempts
to
escape
by
appropriate
maneuvers
suddenly
she
stopped
short
swung
round
and
faced
the
alaska
a
long
white
line
which
was
apparent
extending
westward
told
the
reason
of
this
change
the
albatross
found
herself
so
close
to
the
that
she
had
no
recourse
but
to
turn
and
face
them
the
young
captain
of
the
alaska
had
scarcely
time
to
descend
before
some
missile
whistled
past
his
head
the
albatross
was
armed
and
relied
upon
being
able
to
defend
herself
i
prefer
that
it
should
be
so
and
that
he
should
fire
the
first
shot
said
erik
as
he
gave
orders
to
return
it
his
first
attack
was
not
more
successful
than
that
of
tudor
brown
for
it
fell
short
two
or
three
hundred
yards
but
the
combat
was
now
begun
and
the
firing
became
regular
an
american
projectile
cut
the
large
sail
yards
of
the
alaska
and
it
fell
upon
the
deck
killing
two
men
a
small
bomb
from
the
swedish
vessel
fell
upon
the
bridge
of
the
albatross
and
must
have
made
great
havoc
then
other
projectiles
skillfully
thrown
lodged
in
various
parts
of
the
vessel
they
had
been
constantly
approaching
each
other
when
suddenly
a
distant
rumbling
mingled
with
the
roar
of
artillery
and
the
crews
raising
their
heads
saw
that
the
sky
was
very
black
in
the
east
was
a
storm
with
its
accompanying
fog
and
blinding
snow
coming
to
interpose
between
the
albatross
and
the
alaska
to
permit
tudor
brown
to
escape
this
erik
wished
to
prevent
at
any
price
he
resolved
to
attempt
to
board
her
arming
his
men
with
sabers
cutlasses
and
hatchets
he
crowded
on
all
the
steam
the
vessel
could
carry
and
rushed
toward
the
albatross
tudor
brown
tried
to
prevent
this
he
retreated
toward
the
banks
of
ice
firing
a
shot
from
his
cannon
every
five
minutes
but
his
field
of
action
had
now
become
too
limited
between
the
ice
and
the
alaska
he
saw
that
he
was
lost
unless
he
made
a
bold
attempt
to
regain
the
open
sea
he
attempted
this
after
a
few
feigned
maneuvers
to
deceive
his
adversary
erik
let
him
do
it
then
at
the
precise
moment
when
the
albatross
tried
to
pass
the
alaska
she
made
a
gaping
hole
in
the
side
of
the
yacht
which
stopped
her
instantly
and
rendered
her
almost
unmanageable
then
she
fell
quickly
behind
and
prepared
to
renew
the
assault
but
the
weather
which
had
become
more
and
more
menacing
did
not
give
him
time
to
do
this
the
tempest
was
upon
them
a
fierce
wind
from
the
accompanied
by
blinding
clouds
of
snow
which
not
only
raised
the
waves
to
a
prodigious
height
but
dashed
against
the
two
vessels
immense
masses
of
floating
ice
it
seemed
as
if
they
were
attacked
at
all
points
at
once
erik
realized
his
situation
and
saw
that
he
had
not
a
minute
to
lose
in
escaping
unless
he
wished
to
be
hemmed
in
perhaps
permanently
he
steered
due
east
struggling
against
the
wind
the
snow
and
the
dashing
ice
but
he
was
soon
obliged
to
confess
that
his
efforts
were
fruitless
the
tempest
raged
with
such
violence
that
neither
the
engine
of
the
alaska
nor
her
steel
buttress
were
of
much
use
not
only
did
the
vessel
advance
very
slowly
but
at
times
she
seemed
to
be
fairly
driven
backward
the
snow
was
so
thick
that
it
obscured
the
sky
blinded
the
crew
and
covered
the
bridge
a
foot
in
depth
the
ice
driven
against
the
alaska
by
the
fierce
wind
increased
and
barred
their
progress
so
that
at
length
they
were
glad
to
retreat
toward
the
banks
in
the
hope
of
finding
some
little
haven
where
they
could
remain
until
the
storm
passed
over
the
american
yacht
had
disappeared
and
after
the
blow
it
had
received
from
the
alaska
they
almost
doubted
if
it
would
be
able
to
resist
the
tornado
their
own
situation
was
so
perilous
that
they
could
only
think
of
their
own
safety
for
every
moment
it
grew
worse
there
is
nothing
more
frightful
than
those
arctic
tempests
in
which
all
the
primitive
forces
of
nature
seem
to
be
awakened
in
order
to
give
the
navigator
a
specimen
of
the
cataclysms
of
the
glacial
period
the
darkness
was
profound
although
it
was
only
five
in
the
afternoon
the
engine
had
stopped
and
they
were
unable
to
light
their
electric
light
to
the
raging
of
the
storm
was
added
the
roars
of
thunder
and
the
tumult
made
by
the
floating
blocks
of
ice
dashing
against
each
other
the
were
continually
breaking
with
a
noise
like
the
roar
of
a
cannon
the
alaska
was
soon
surrounded
by
ice
the
little
harbor
in
which
she
had
taken
refuge
was
soon
completely
filled
with
it
and
it
commenced
to
press
upon
and
dash
against
her
sides
until
she
began
to
crack
and
they
feared
every
moment
that
she
would
go
to
pieces
erik
resolved
not
to
succumb
to
the
storm
without
a
combat
with
it
and
he
set
the
crew
to
work
arranging
heavy
beams
around
the
vessel
so
as
to
weaken
the
pressure
as
much
as
possible
and
distribute
it
over
a
wider
surface
but
although
this
protected
the
vessel
it
led
to
an
unforeseen
result
which
threatened
to
be
fatal
the
vessel
instead
of
being
suddenly
crushed
was
lifted
out
of
the
water
by
every
movement
of
the
ice
and
then
fell
back
again
on
it
with
the
force
of
a
at
any
moment
after
one
of
these
frightful
falls
they
might
be
broken
up
crushed
buried
to
ward
off
this
danger
there
was
only
one
resource
and
this
was
to
their
barrier
by
heaping
up
the
drift
ice
and
snow
around
the
vessel
to
protect
her
as
well
as
they
could
everybody
set
to
work
with
ardor
it
was
a
touching
spectacle
to
see
this
little
handful
of
men
taxing
their
pygmy
muscles
to
resist
the
forces
of
nature
trying
with
anchors
chains
and
planks
to
fill
up
the
fissures
made
in
the
ice
and
to
cover
them
with
snow
so
that
there
might
be
a
uniformity
of
motion
among
the
mass
after
four
or
five
hours
of
almost
superhuman
exertions
and
when
their
strength
was
exhausted
they
were
in
no
less
danger
for
the
storm
had
increased
erik
held
a
consultation
with
his
officers
and
it
was
decided
that
they
should
make
a
depot
on
the
for
their
food
and
ammunition
in
case
the
alaska
should
be
unable
to
resist
the
powerful
shocks
to
which
she
was
being
subjected
at
the
first
moment
of
danger
every
man
had
received
provisions
enough
for
eight
days
with
precise
instructions
in
case
of
disaster
besides
being
ordered
to
keep
his
gun
in
his
belt
even
while
he
was
working
the
operation
of
transporting
twenty
tons
of
provisions
was
not
easy
of
accomplishment
but
at
last
it
was
done
and
the
food
was
placed
about
two
hundred
yards
from
the
ship
under
a
covering
of
tarred
canvas
which
was
soon
covered
by
the
snow
with
a
thick
white
mantle
this
precaution
having
been
taken
everybody
felt
more
comfortable
as
to
the
result
of
a
shipwreck
and
the
crew
assembled
to
recruit
their
strength
with
a
supper
supplemented
with
tea
and
rum
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
supper
a
more
violent
shock
than
any
that
had
as
yet
agitated
the
vessel
split
the
bed
of
ice
and
snow
around
the
alaska
she
was
lifted
up
in
the
stern
with
a
terrible
noise
and
then
it
appeared
as
if
she
were
plunging
into
an
abyss
there
was
a
panic
and
every
one
rushed
on
deck
some
of
the
men
thought
that
the
moment
had
come
to
take
refuge
on
the
ice
and
without
waiting
for
the
signal
of
the
officers
they
commenced
clambering
over
the
bulwarks
four
or
five
of
these
unfortunate
ones
managed
to
leap
on
a
two
others
were
caught
between
the
masses
of
floating
ice
and
the
beams
of
the
starboard
as
the
alaska
righted
herself
their
cries
of
pain
and
the
noise
of
their
crushed
bones
were
lost
in
the
storm
there
was
a
lull
and
the
vessel
remained
motionless
the
lesson
which
the
sailors
had
been
taught
was
a
tragical
one
erik
made
use
of
it
to
enforce
on
the
crew
the
necessity
of
each
man
retaining
his
presence
of
mind
and
of
waiting
for
positive
orders
on
all
occasions
you
must
understand
he
said
to
his
men
that
to
leave
the
ship
is
a
supreme
measure
to
which
we
must
have
recourse
only
at
the
last
extremity
all
our
efforts
ought
to
be
directed
toward
saving
the
deprived
of
her
our
situation
will
be
a
very
precarious
one
on
the
ice
it
is
only
in
case
of
our
vessel
becoming
uninhabitable
that
we
must
desert
it
in
any
case
such
a
movement
should
be
made
in
an
orderly
manner
to
avoid
disasters
i
therefore
expect
that
you
will
return
quietly
to
your
supper
and
leave
to
your
superior
officers
the
task
of
determining
what
is
best
to
do
the
firmness
with
which
he
spoke
had
the
effect
of
reassuring
the
most
timid
and
they
all
descended
again
erik
then
called
hersebom
and
asked
him
to
untie
his
good
dog
kaas
and
follow
him
without
making
any
noise
we
will
go
on
the
field
of
ice
he
said
and
seek
for
the
fugitives
and
make
them
return
to
their
duty
which
will
be
better
for
them
than
wandering
about
the
poor
devils
were
huddled
together
on
the
ice
ashamed
of
their
escapade
and
at
the
first
summons
were
only
too
glad
to
take
the
path
toward
the
alaska
erik
and
hersebom
having
seen
them
safely
on
board
walked
as
far
as
their
depot
of
provisions
thinking
that
another
sailor
might
have
taken
refuge
there
they
went
all
around
it
but
saw
no
one
i
have
been
asking
myself
the
last
few
moments
said
erik
if
it
would
not
be
better
to
prevent
another
panic
by
landing
part
of
the
crew
it
might
be
better
perhaps
answered
the
fisherman
but
would
not
the
men
who
remained
on
board
feel
jealous
and
become
demoralized
by
this
measure
that
is
true
said
erik
it
would
be
wiser
to
occupy
them
up
to
the
last
moment
in
struggling
against
the
tempest
and
it
is
in
fact
the
only
chance
we
have
of
saving
the
ship
but
since
we
are
on
the
ice
we
may
as
well
take
advantage
of
it
and
explore
it
a
little
i
confess
all
these
crackings
and
detonations
inspire
me
with
some
doubt
as
to
its
solidity
erik
and
his
adopted
father
had
not
gone
more
than
three
hundred
feet
from
their
depot
of
provisions
before
they
were
stopped
short
by
a
gigantic
crevasse
which
lay
open
at
their
feet
to
cross
it
would
have
required
long
poles
with
which
they
had
neglected
to
supply
themselves
they
were
therefore
compelled
to
walk
beside
it
obliquely
toward
the
west
in
order
to
see
how
far
it
reached
they
found
that
this
crevasse
extended
for
a
long
distance
so
long
that
after
they
had
walked
for
half
an
hour
they
could
not
see
the
end
of
it
feeling
more
secure
about
the
extent
of
this
field
of
ice
upon
which
they
had
established
their
depot
of
provisions
they
turned
to
retreat
their
steps
after
they
had
walked
over
about
half
of
the
distance
a
new
vibration
occurred
followed
by
detonations
and
tumultuous
heavings
of
ice
they
were
not
greatly
disturbed
by
this
but
increased
their
speed
being
anxious
to
discover
whether
this
shock
had
had
done
the
alaska
any
mischief
the
depot
was
soon
reached
then
the
little
haven
that
sheltered
the
vessel
erik
and
hersebom
rubbed
their
eyes
and
asked
each
other
whether
they
were
dreaming
for
the
alaska
was
no
longer
there
their
first
thought
was
that
she
had
been
swallowed
up
by
the
waters
it
was
only
too
natural
that
they
should
think
this
after
such
an
evening
as
they
had
just
passed
but
immediately
they
were
struck
by
the
fact
that
no
was
visible
and
that
the
little
harbor
had
assumed
a
new
aspect
since
their
departure
the
drift
ice
which
the
tempest
had
piled
up
around
the
alaska
had
been
broken
up
and
much
of
it
had
drifted
away
at
the
same
time
hersebom
mentioned
a
fact
which
had
not
struck
him
while
they
were
hurrying
along
and
this
was
that
the
wind
had
changed
and
was
now
blowing
from
the
west
was
it
not
possible
that
the
storm
had
carried
away
the
floating
ice
in
which
the
alaska
had
become
embedded
yes
evidently
it
was
possible
but
it
remained
for
them
to
discover
whether
this
supposition
was
true
without
delaying
a
moment
erik
proceeded
to
reconnoiter
followed
by
hersebom
they
walked
for
a
long
time
everywhere
the
drift
was
floating
freely
the
waves
came
and
went
but
the
whole
aspect
of
things
around
them
looked
strange
and
different
at
length
erik
stopped
now
he
understood
what
had
befallen
them
he
took
hersebom
hand
and
pressed
it
with
both
his
own
father
said
he
in
a
grave
voice
you
are
one
of
those
to
whom
i
can
only
speak
the
truth
well
the
fact
is
that
this
has
split
it
has
broken
away
from
that
which
surrounded
the
and
we
are
on
an
island
of
ice
hundreds
of
yards
long
and
carried
along
by
the
waters
and
at
the
mercy
of
the
storm

erik
and
hersebom
exhausted
with
fatigue
laid
down
side
by
side
between
two
casks
under
the
canvas
that
protected
their
provisions
kaas
also
was
close
to
them
and
kept
them
warm
with
his
thick
fur
they
were
not
long
in
falling
asleep
when
they
awoke
the
sun
was
already
high
in
the
heavens
the
sky
was
blue
and
the
sea
calm
the
immense
bank
of
ice
upon
which
they
were
floating
appeared
to
be
motionless
its
movement
was
so
gentle
and
regular
but
along
the
two
edges
of
it
which
were
nearest
to
them
enormous
icebergs
were
being
carried
along
with
frightful
rapidity
these
gigantic
crystals
reflected
like
a
prism
the
solar
rays
and
they
were
the
most
marvelous
that
erik
had
ever
beheld
hersebom
also
although
but
little
inclined
in
general
and
especially
in
his
present
situation
to
admire
the
splendor
of
nature
in
the
arctic
regions
could
not
help
being
impressed
with
them
how
beautiful
this
would
look
were
we
on
a
good
ship
he
said
sighing
bah
answered
erik
with
his
usual
good
humor
on
board
a
ship
one
must
be
thinking
only
how
to
avoid
the
icebergs
so
as
not
to
be
crushed
to
pieces
whilst
on
this
island
of
ice
we
have
none
of
these
miseries
to
worry
us
as
this
was
evidently
the
view
of
an
optimist
hersebom
answered
with
a
sad
smile
but
erik
was
determined
to
take
a
cheerful
view
of
things
is
it
not
an
extraordinary
piece
of
good
luck
that
we
have
this
depot
of
provisions
he
said
our
case
would
indeed
be
a
desperate
one
if
we
were
deprived
of
everything
but
with
twenty
casks
of
biscuits
preserved
meats
and
above
all
our
guns
and
cartridges
what
have
we
to
fear
at
the
most
we
will
only
have
to
remain
some
weeks
without
seeing
any
land
that
we
can
reach
you
see
dear
father
that
we
have
happened
upon
this
adventure
in
the
same
manner
as
the
crew
of
the
of
the
asked
hersebom
with
curiosity
yes
a
vessel
that
set
out
in
for
the
arctic
seas
part
of
her
crew
were
left
as
we
are
on
a
floating
field
of
ice
while
they
were
occupied
in
transporting
some
provisions
and
coal
the
brave
men
accommodated
themselves
as
well
as
they
could
to
this
new
life
and
after
floating
for
six
mouths
and
a
half
over
a
distance
of
several
thousand
leagues
ended
by
landing
in
the
arctic
regions
of
north
america
may
we
be
as
fortunate
said
hersebom
with
a
sigh
but
it
would
be
well
i
think
for
us
to
eat
something
that
is
also
my
opinion
said
erik
a
biscuit
and
a
slice
of
beef
would
be
very
acceptable
hersebom
opened
two
casks
to
take
out
what
they
required
for
their
breakfast
and
as
soon
as
his
arrangements
were
completed
they
did
ample
justice
to
the
provisions
was
the
raft
of
the
crew
of
the
as
large
as
ours
asked
the
old
fisherman
after
ten
minutes
conscientiously
devoted
to
repairing
his
strength
i
think
not
ours
is
considerably
larger
the
became
gradually
much
smaller
so
that
the
unfortunate
shipwrecked
men
were
at
last
compelled
to
abandon
it
for
the
waves
began
to
dash
over
them
fortunately
they
had
a
large
boat
which
enabled
them
when
their
island
was
no
longer
habitable
to
reach
another
they
did
this
several
times
before
they
at
last
reached
the
ah
i
see
said
hersebom
they
had
a
boat
but
we
have
not
unless
we
embark
in
an
empty
hogshead
i
do
not
see
how
we
can
ever
leave
this
island
of
ice
we
shall
see
about
it
when
the
time
comes
answered
erik
at
the
present
moment
i
think
the
best
thing
that
we
can
do
is
to
make
a
thorough
exploration
of
our
domain
he
arose
as
did
hersebom
and
they
commenced
climbing
a
hill
of
ice
and
snow
a
hummock
is
the
technical
name
in
order
to
obtain
a
general
idea
of
their
island
they
found
it
from
one
end
to
the
other
lying
and
floating
insensibly
upon
the
polar
ocean
but
it
was
very
difficult
to
form
a
correct
estimate
either
of
its
size
or
shape
for
a
great
number
of
hummocks
intercepted
their
view
on
all
sides
they
resolved
however
to
walk
to
the
extremity
of
it
as
far
as
they
could
judge
from
the
position
of
the
sun
that
end
of
the
island
which
extended
toward
the
west
had
been
detached
from
the
mass
of
which
it
had
formerly
been
a
part
and
was
now
turning
to
the
north
they
therefore
supposed
that
their
ice
raft
was
being
carried
toward
the
south
by
the
influence
of
the
tide
and
breeze
and
the
fact
that
they
no
longer
saw
any
trace
of
the
long
barriers
of
ice
which
are
very
extensive
in
the
fully
corroborated
this
hypothesis
their
island
was
entirely
covered
with
snow
and
upon
this
snow
they
saw
distinctly
here
and
there
at
a
distance
some
black
spots
which
hersebom
immediately
recognized
as
ongionks
that
is
to
say
a
species
of
walrus
of
great
size
these
walruses
doubtless
inhabited
the
caverns
and
crevasses
in
the
ice
and
believing
themselves
perfectly
secure
from
any
attack
were
basking
in
the
sunshine
it
took
erik
and
hersebom
more
than
an
hour
to
walk
to
the
extreme
end
of
their
island
they
had
followed
closely
the
eastern
side
because
that
permitted
them
to
explore
at
the
same
time
both
their
raft
and
the
sea
suddenly
kaas
who
ran
ahead
of
them
put
to
flight
some
of
the
walruses
which
they
had
seen
in
the
distance
they
ran
toward
the
border
of
the
field
of
ice
in
order
to
throw
themselves
into
the
water
nothing
would
have
been
more
easy
than
to
have
killed
a
number
of
them
but
what
would
have
been
the
use
of
their
doing
so
since
they
could
not
make
a
fire
to
roast
their
delicate
flesh
erik
was
occupied
about
other
matters
he
carefully
examined
the
and
found
that
it
was
far
from
being
homogeneous
numerous
crevasses
and
fissures
which
seemed
to
extend
in
many
cases
for
a
long
distance
made
him
fear
that
a
slight
shock
might
divide
it
into
several
fragments
it
was
true
that
these
fragments
might
in
all
probability
be
of
considerable
size
but
the
possibility
of
such
an
accident
made
them
realize
the
necessity
of
keeping
as
close
as
possible
to
their
depot
of
provisions
unless
they
wished
to
be
deprived
of
them
erik
resolved
to
examine
carefully
their
whole
domain
and
to
make
his
abode
on
the
most
massive
portion
the
one
that
seemed
capable
of
offering
the
greatest
resistance
he
also
determined
to
transport
to
this
spot
their
depot
of
provisions
it
was
with
this
resolve
that
hersebom
and
erik
continued
their
exploration
of
the
western
coast
after
resting
a
few
minutes
at
the
northerly
point
they
were
now
following
that
portion
of
the
where
they
had
attacked
the
american
yacht
kaas
ran
on
before
them
seeming
to
enjoy
the
freshness
of
the
air
and
being
in
his
true
element
on
this
carpet
of
snow
which
doubtless
reminded
him
of
the
plains
of
greenland
suddenly
erik
saw
him
sniff
the
air
and
then
dart
forward
like
an
arrow
and
stop
barking
beside
some
dark
object
which
was
partially
hidden
by
a
mass
of
ice
another
walrus
i
suppose
he
said
hurrying
forward
it
was
not
a
walrus
which
lay
extended
on
the
snow
and
which
had
so
excited
kaas
it
was
a
man
insensible
and
covered
with
blood
whose
clothing
of
skins
was
assuredly
not
the
dress
worn
by
any
seamen
of
the
alaska
it
reminded
erik
of
the
clothing
worn
by
the
man
who
had
passed
the
winter
on
the
vega
he
raised
the
head
of
the
man
it
was
covered
with
thick
red
hair
and
it
was
remarkable
that
his
nose
was
crushed
in
like
that
of
a
negro
erik
asked
himself
whether
he
was
the
sport
of
some
illusion
he
opened
the
man
waistcoat
and
bared
his
chest
it
was
perhaps
as
much
to
ascertain
whether
his
heart
still
beat
as
to
seek
for
his
name
he
found
his
name
tattooed
in
blue
on
a
rudely
designed
escutcheon
patrick
and
his
heart
still
beat
the
man
was
not
dead
he
had
a
large
wound
in
his
head
another
in
his
shoulder
and
on
his
chest
a
contusion
which
greatly
interfered
with
his
respiration
he
must
be
carried
to
our
place
of
shelter
and
restored
to
life
said
erik
to
hersebom
and
then
he
added
in
a
low
tone
as
if
he
was
afraid
of
being
overheard
it
is
he
father
whom
we
have
been
seeking
for
such
a
long
time
without
being
able
to
find
him
patrick
and
see
he
is
almost
unable
to
breathe
the
thought
that
the
secret
of
his
life
was
known
to
this
bloody
object
upon
which
death
already
appeared
to
have
set
his
seal
kindled
a
gloomy
flame
in
erik
eyes
his
adopted
father
divined
his
thoughts
and
could
not
help
shrugging
his
shoulders
he
seemed
to
say
of
what
use
would
it
be
to
discover
it
now
the
knowledge
of
all
the
secrets
in
the
world
would
be
useless
to
us
he
however
took
the
body
by
the
limbs
while
erik
lifted
him
under
the
arms
and
loaded
with
this
burden
they
resumed
their
walk
the
motion
made
the
wounded
man
open
his
eyes
soon
the
pain
caused
by
his
wounds
was
so
great
that
he
began
to
moan
and
utter
confused
cries
among
which
they
distinguished
the
english
word
drink
they
were
still
some
distance
from
their
depot
of
provisions
erik
however
stopped
and
propped
the
unfortunate
man
against
a
hummock
and
then
put
his
leathern
bottle
to
his
lips
it
was
nearly
empty
but
the
mouthful
of
strong
liquor
that
patrick
swallowed
seemed
to
restore
him
to
life
he
looked
around
him
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
then
said
where
is
mr
jones
we
found
you
alone
on
the
ice
answered
erik
had
you
been
there
long
i
do
not
know
answered
the
wounded
man
with
difficulty
give
me
something
more
to
drink
he
swallowed
a
second
mouthful
and
then
he
recovered
sufficiently
to
be
able
to
speak
when
the
tempest
overtook
us
the
yacht
sunk
he
explained
some
of
the
crew
had
time
to
throw
themselves
into
the
boats
the
rest
perished
at
the
first
moment
of
peril
jones
made
a
sign
for
me
to
go
with
him
into
a
which
was
suspended
in
the
stern
of
the
yacht
and
that
every
one
else
disdained
on
account
of
its
small
dimensions
but
which
proved
to
be
safe
as
it
was
impossible
to
sink
it
it
is
the
only
one
which
reached
the
ice
island
all
the
others
were
upset
before
they
reached
it
we
were
terribly
wounded
by
the
drift
ice
which
the
waves
threw
into
our
boat
but
at
length
we
were
able
to
draw
ourselves
beyond
their
reach
and
wait
for
the
dawn
of
day
this
morning
jones
left
me
to
go
and
see
if
he
could
kill
a
walrus
or
some
in
order
that
we
might
have
something
to
eat
i
have
not
seen
him
since
is
jones
one
of
the
officers
of
the
asked
erik
he
is
the
owner
and
captain
of
her
answered
in
a
tone
which
seemed
to
express
surprise
at
the
question
then
tudor
brown
is
not
the
captain
of
the
i
do
know
said
the
wounded
man
hesitatingly
seeming
to
ask
himself
whether
he
had
been
too
confidential
in
speaking
as
freely
as
he
had
done
erik
did
not
think
it
wise
to
insist
on
this
point
he
had
too
many
other
questions
to
ask
you
see
he
said
to
the
irishman
as
he
seated
himself
on
the
snow
beside
him
you
refused
the
other
day
to
come
on
board
of
my
ship
and
talk
with
me
and
your
refusal
has
occasioned
many
disasters
but
now
that
we
have
met
again
let
us
profit
by
this
opportunity
to
talk
seriously
and
like
rational
men
you
see
you
are
here
on
a
floating
without
food
and
seriously
wounded
incapable
by
your
own
efforts
of
escaping
the
most
cruel
death
my
adopted
father
and
myself
have
all
that
you
need
food
and
brandy
we
will
share
with
you
and
take
care
of
you
until
you
are
well
again
in
return
for
our
care
we
only
ask
you
to
treat
us
with
a
little
confidence
the
irishman
gave
erik
an
irresolute
look
in
which
gratitude
seemed
to
mingle
with
fear
a
look
of
fearful
indecision
that
depends
on
the
kind
of
confidence
that
you
ask
for
he
said
evasively
oh
you
know
very
well
answered
erik
making
an
effort
to
smile
and
taking
in
his
hands
those
of
the
wounded
man
i
told
you
the
other
day
you
know
what
i
want
to
find
out
and
what
i
have
come
so
far
to
discover
now
patrick
make
a
little
effort
and
disclose
to
me
this
secret
which
is
of
so
much
importance
to
me
tell
me
what
you
know
about
the
infant
tied
to
the
buoy
give
me
the
faintest
indication
of
who
i
am
so
that
i
may
find
my
family
what
do
you
fear
what
danger
do
you
run
in
satisfying
me
did
not
answer
but
seemed
to
be
turning
over
in
his
obtuse
brain
the
arguments
that
erik
had
used
but
he
said
at
last
with
an
effort
if
we
succeed
in
getting
away
from
here
and
we
reach
some
country
where
there
are
judges
and
courts
you
could
do
me
some
harm
no
i
swear
that
i
would
not
i
swear
it
by
all
that
is
sacred
said
erik
hotly
whatever
may
be
the
injuries
you
have
inflicted
upon
me
or
upon
others
i
guarantee
that
you
shall
not
suffer
for
them
in
any
way
besides
there
is
one
fact
of
which
you
seem
to
be
ignorant
it
is
that
there
is
a
limit
to
such
matters
when
such
events
have
taken
place
more
than
twenty
years
ago
human
justice
has
no
longer
the
right
to
demand
an
accounting
for
them
is
that
true
asked
patrick
distrustfully
jones
told
me
that
the
had
been
sent
by
the
police
and
you
yourself
spoke
of
a
tribunal
that
was
about
recent
events
an
accident
that
happened
to
us
at
the
beginning
of
our
journey
you
may
be
sure
that
jones
was
mocking
you
patrick
doubtless
he
has
some
interest
of
his
own
for
wishing
you
not
to
tell
you
may
be
sure
of
that
said
the
irishman
earnestly
but
how
did
you
discover
that
i
was
acquainted
with
this
secret
through
and
bowles
of
the
red
anchor
in
brooklyn
who
had
often
heard
you
speak
of
the
infant
tied
to
the
buoy
that
is
true
said
the
irishman
he
reflected
again
then
you
are
sure
that
you
were
not
sent
by
the
police
he
said
at
length
no
what
an
absurd
idea
i
came
of
my
own
accord
on
account
of
my
ardent
desire
my
thirst
to
discover
the
land
of
my
birth
and
to
find
out
who
my
parents
were
that
is
all
smiled
proudly
ah
that
is
what
you
want
to
know
he
said
well
it
is
true
that
i
can
tell
you
it
is
true
that
i
know
tell
me
tell
me
cried
erik
seeing
that
he
hesitated
tell
me
and
i
promise
you
pardon
for
all
the
evil
that
you
have
done
and
my
everlasting
gratitude
if
i
am
ever
in
a
position
to
show
it
the
irishman
gave
a
covetous
look
at
the
leathern
bottle
it
makes
my
throat
dry
to
talk
so
much
he
said
in
a
faint
tone
i
will
drink
a
little
more
if
you
are
willing
to
give
it
to
me
there
is
no
more
here
but
we
can
get
some
at
our
depot
of
provisions
we
have
two
large
cases
of
brandy
there
answered
erik
handing
the
bottle
to
hersebom
the
latter
immediately
walked
away
followed
by
kaas
they
will
not
be
gone
long
said
the
young
man
turning
toward
his
companion
now
my
brave
fellow
do
not
make
merchandise
of
your
confidence
put
yourself
in
my
place
suppose
that
during
all
your
life
you
had
been
ignorant
of
the
name
of
your
country
and
that
of
your
mother
and
that
at
last
you
found
yourself
in
the
presence
of
a
man
who
knew
all
about
it
and
who
refused
the
information
which
was
of
such
inestimable
value
to
you
and
that
at
the
very
time
when
you
had
saved
him
restored
him
to
consciousness
and
life
i
do
not
ask
you
to
do
anything
impossible
i
do
not
ask
you
to
criminate
yourself
if
you
have
anything
to
reproach
yourself
with
give
me
only
an
indication
the
very
slightest
put
me
on
the
track
so
that
i
can
find
my
family
and
that
is
all
that
i
shall
ask
of
you
by
my
faith
i
will
do
you
this
favor
said
patrick
evidently
moved
you
know
that
i
was
a
on
board
the
he
stopped
short
erik
hung
upon
his
words
was
he
at
last
going
to
find
out
the
truth
was
he
going
to
solve
this
enigma
and
discover
the
name
of
his
family
the
land
of
his
birth
truly
the
scene
appeared
to
him
almost
chimerical
he
fastened
his
eyes
upon
the
wounded
man
ready
to
drink
in
his
words
with
avidity
for
nothing
in
the
world
would
he
have
interfered
with
his
recital
neither
by
interruption
nor
gesture
he
did
not
even
observe
that
a
shadow
had
appeared
behind
him
it
was
the
sight
of
this
shadow
which
had
stopped
the
story
of
patrick
mr
jones
he
said
in
the
tone
of
a
detected
in
some
flagrant
mischief
erik
turned
and
saw
tudor
brown
coming
around
a
neighboring
hummock
where
until
this
moment
he
had
been
hidden
from
their
sight
the
exclamation
of
the
irishman
confirmed
the
suspicion
which
during
the
last
hour
had
presented
itself
to
his
mind
jones
and
tudor
brown
were
one
and
the
same
person
he
had
hardly
time
to
make
this
reflection
before
two
shots
were
heard
tudor
brown
raised
his
gun
and
shot
patrick
through
the
heart
who
fell
backward
then
before
he
had
time
to
lower
his
rifle
tudor
brown
received
a
bullet
in
his
forehead
and
fell
forward
on
his
face
i
did
well
to
come
back
when
i
saw
suspicious
footprints
in
the
snow
said
hersebom
coming
forward
his
gun
still
smoking
in
his
hands
chapter
xx
the
end
of
the
voyage
erik
gave
a
cry
and
threw
himself
on
his
knees
beside
patrick
seeking
for
some
sign
of
life
a
ray
of
hope
but
the
irishman
was
certainly
dead
this
time
and
that
without
revealing
his
secret
as
for
tudor
brown
one
convulsion
shook
his
body
his
gun
fell
from
his
hands
in
which
he
had
tightly
held
it
at
the
moment
of
his
fall
and
he
expired
without
a
word
father
what
have
you
done
cried
erik
bitterly
why
have
you
deprived
me
of
the
last
chance
that
was
left
to
me
of
discovering
the
secret
of
my
birth
would
it
not
have
been
better
for
us
to
throw
ourselves
upon
this
man
and
take
him
prisoner
and
do
you
believe
that
he
would
have
allowed
us
to
do
so
answered
hersebom
his
second
shot
was
intended
for
you
you
may
be
sure
i
have
avenged
the
murder
of
this
unfortunate
man
punished
the
criminal
who
attempted
to
shipwreck
us
and
who
is
guilty
perhaps
of
other
crimes
whatever
may
be
the
result
i
do
not
regret
having
done
so
besides
of
what
consequence
is
the
mystery
surrounding
your
birth
my
child
to
men
in
our
situation
the
secret
of
your
birth
before
long
without
doubt
will
be
revealed
to
us
by
god
he
had
hardly
finished
speaking
when
the
firing
of
a
cannon
was
heard
and
it
was
by
the
icebergs
it
seemed
like
a
reply
to
the
discouraging
words
of
the
old
fisherman
it
was
doubtless
a
response
to
the
two
gunshots
which
had
been
fired
on
their
island
of
ice
the
cannon
of
the
we
are
saved
cried
erik
jumping
up
and
climbing
a
hummock
to
get
a
better
view
of
the
sea
that
surrounded
them
he
saw
nothing
at
first
but
the
icebergs
driven
by
the
wind
and
sparkling
in
the
sunshine
but
hersebom
who
had
immediately
reloaded
his
gun
fired
into
the
air
and
a
second
discharge
from
the
cannon
answered
him
almost
immediately
then
erik
discovered
a
thin
streak
of
black
smoke
toward
the
west
clearly
defined
against
the
blue
sky
gunshots
answered
by
the
cannon
were
repeated
at
intervals
of
a
few
minutes
and
soon
the
alaska
steamed
around
an
iceberg
and
made
all
speed
toward
the
north
of
the
island
erik
and
hersebom
weeping
for
joy
threw
themselves
into
each
other
arms
they
waved
their
handkerchiefs
and
threw
their
caps
into
the
air
seeking
by
all
means
to
attract
the
attention
of
their
friends
at
length
the
alaska
stopped
a
boat
was
lowered
and
in
twenty
minutes
it
reached
their
island
who
can
describe
the
unbounded
joy
of
schwaryencrona
bredejord
malarius
and
otto
when
they
found
them
well
and
safe
for
through
the
long
hours
of
that
sad
night
they
had
mourned
them
as
lost
they
related
all
that
had
befallen
them
their
fears
and
despair
during
the
night
their
vain
appeals
their
useless
anger
the
alaska
had
been
found
in
the
morning
to
be
almost
entirely
clear
of
the
ice
and
they
had
dislodged
what
remained
with
the
assistance
of
their
gunpowder
bosewitz
had
taken
command
being
the
and
had
immediately
started
in
search
of
the
floating
island
taking
the
direction
in
which
the
wind
would
carry
it
this
navigation
amidst
floating
icebergs
was
the
most
perilous
which
the
alaska
had
as
yet
attempted
but
thanks
to
the
excellent
training
to
which
the
young
captain
had
accustomed
his
crew
and
to
the
experience
which
they
had
acquired
in
maneuvering
the
vessel
they
passed
safely
among
these
moving
masses
of
ice
without
being
crushed
by
them
the
alaska
had
had
the
advantage
of
being
able
to
travel
more
swiftly
than
the
icebergs
and
she
had
been
able
to
benefit
by
this
circumstance
kind
providence
had
willed
that
her
search
should
not
prove
fruitless
at
nine
in
the
morning
the
island
had
been
sighted
they
recognized
it
by
its
shape
and
then
the
two
shots
from
the
guns
made
them
hopeful
of
finding
their
two
shipwrecked
friends
all
their
other
troubles
now
appeared
to
them
as
insignificant
they
had
a
long
and
dangerous
voyage
before
them
which
they
must
accomplish
under
sail
for
their
coal
was
exhausted
no
said
erik
we
will
not
make
it
under
sail
i
have
another
plan
we
will
permit
the
ice
island
to
tow
us
along
as
long
as
she
goes
toward
the
south
or
west
that
will
spare
us
incessantly
fighting
with
the
icebergs
for
our
island
will
chase
them
ahead
of
her
then
we
can
collect
here
all
the
combustibles
that
we
will
require
in
order
to
finish
the
voyage
when
we
are
ready
to
resume
it
what
are
you
talking
about
asked
the
doctor
laughing
is
there
an
on
this
island
not
exactly
an
answered
erik
but
what
will
answer
our
purpose
nearly
as
well
multitudes
of
fat
walruses
i
wish
to
try
an
experiment
since
we
have
one
furnace
especially
adapted
for
burning
oil
they
began
their
labors
by
performing
the
last
rites
of
the
two
dead
men
they
tied
weights
to
their
feet
and
lowered
them
into
the
sea
then
the
alaska
made
fast
to
the
ice
bank
in
such
a
manner
as
to
follow
its
movements
without
sustaining
any
injury
to
herself
they
were
able
with
care
to
carry
on
board
again
the
provisions
which
they
had
landed
and
which
it
was
important
for
them
not
to
lose
that
operation
accomplished
they
devoted
all
their
energies
to
the
pursuit
of
the
walrus
two
or
three
times
a
day
parties
armed
with
guns
and
harpoons
and
accompanied
by
all
their
greenland
dogs
landed
on
the
ice
bank
and
surrounded
the
sleeping
monsters
at
the
mouth
of
their
holes
they
killed
them
by
firing
a
ball
into
their
ears
then
they
cut
them
up
and
placed
the
lard
with
which
they
were
filled
in
their
sleighs
and
the
dogs
drew
it
to
the
alaska
their
hunting
was
so
easy
and
so
productive
that
in
eight
days
they
had
all
the
lard
that
they
could
carry
the
alaska
still
towed
by
the
floating
island
was
now
in
the
degree
that
is
to
say
she
had
passed
nova
zembla
the
ice
island
was
now
reduced
at
least
and
cracked
by
the
sun
was
full
of
fissures
more
or
less
extensive
evidently
ready
to
go
to
pieces
erik
resolved
not
to
wait
until
this
happened
and
ordering
their
anchor
to
be
lifted
he
sailed
away
westward
the
lard
was
immediately
utilized
in
the
fire
of
the
alaska
and
proved
an
excellent
combustible
the
only
fault
was
that
it
choked
up
the
chimney
which
necessitated
a
daily
cleaning
as
for
its
odor
that
would
doubtless
have
been
very
disagreeable
to
southern
passengers
but
to
a
crew
composed
of
swedes
and
norwegians
it
was
only
a
secondary
inconvenience
thanks
to
this
supply
the
alaska
was
able
to
keep
up
steam
during
the
whole
of
the
remainder
of
her
voyage
she
proceeded
rapidly
in
spite
of
contrary
winds
and
arrived
on
the
of
september
in
sight
of
cape
north
or
norway
they
pursued
their
route
with
all
possible
speed
turned
the
scandinavian
peninsula
repassed
and
reached
the
spot
from
which
they
had
taken
their
departure
on
the
of
september
they
cast
anchor
before
stockholm
which
they
had
left
on
the
tenth
of
the
preceding
february
thus
in
seven
months
and
four
days
the
first
circumpolar
periplus
had
been
accomplished
by
a
navigator
of
only
years
of
age
this
geographical
feat
which
so
promptly
completed
the
great
expedition
of
nordenskiold
would
soon
make
a
prodigious
commotion
in
the
world
but
the
journals
and
reviews
had
not
as
yet
had
time
to
expatiate
upon
it
the
uninitiated
were
hardly
prepared
to
understand
it
and
one
person
at
least
reviewed
it
with
suspicion
this
was
kajsa
the
supercilious
smile
with
which
she
listened
to
the
story
of
their
adventures
was
indescribable
was
it
sensible
to
expose
yourself
to
such
dangers
was
her
only
comment
but
the
first
opportunity
that
presented
itself
she
did
not
fail
to
say
to
erik
i
suppose
that
now
you
will
do
nothing
more
about
this
tiresome
matter
since
the
irishman
is
dead
what
a
difference
there
was
between
these
cold
criticisms
and
the
letters
full
of
sympathy
and
tenderness
that
erik
soon
received
from
noroe
vanda
told
him
in
what
a
state
of
anxiety
she
and
her
mother
had
passed
these
long
months
how
the
travelers
had
been
ever
present
in
their
thoughts
and
how
happy
they
were
when
they
heard
of
their
safe
return
if
the
expedition
had
not
accomplished
all
that
erik
hoped
they
begged
him
not
to
worry
himself
too
much
about
it
he
must
know
that
if
he
never
succeeded
in
finding
his
own
family
he
had
one
in
the
poor
norwegian
village
where
he
would
be
tenderly
cared
for
like
one
of
themselves
would
he
not
soon
come
and
see
them
could
he
not
stay
with
them
one
little
month
it
was
the
sincere
desire
of
his
adopted
mother
and
of
his
little
sister
vanda
etc
the
envelope
also
contained
three
pretty
flowers
gathered
on
the
borders
of
the
fiord
and
their
perfume
seemed
to
bring
back
vividly
to
erik
his
gay
and
careless
childhood
ah
how
sweet
these
loving
words
were
to
his
poor
disappointed
heart
and
they
enabled
him
to
fulfill
more
easily
the
concluding
duties
appertaining
to
the
expedition
he
hoped
soon
to
be
able
to
go
and
tell
them
all
he
felt
the
voyage
of
the
alaska
had
equaled
in
grandeur
that
of
the
vega
the
name
of
erik
was
everywhere
associated
with
the
glorious
name
of
nordenskiold
the
journals
had
a
great
deal
to
say
about
the
new
periplus
the
ships
of
all
nations
anchored
at
stockholm
united
in
doing
honor
to
this
national
victor
the
learned
societies
came
in
a
body
to
congratulate
the
commander
and
crew
of
the
alaska
the
public
authorities
proposed
a
national
recompense
for
them
all
these
praises
were
painful
to
erik
his
conscience
told
him
that
the
principal
motive
of
this
expedition
on
his
part
had
been
purely
a
personal
one
and
he
felt
scrupulous
about
accepting
honors
which
appeared
to
him
greatly
exaggerated
he
therefore
availed
himself
of
the
first
opportunity
to
state
frankly
that
he
had
gone
to
the
polar
seas
to
discover
if
possible
the
secret
of
his
birth
and
of
the
shipwreck
of
the
cynthia
that
he
had
been
unsuccessful
in
doing
so
the
occasion
was
offered
by
a
reporter
of
one
of
the
principal
newspapers
of
stockholm
who
presented
himself
on
board
of
the
alaska
and
solicited
the
favor
of
a
private
interview
with
the
young
captain
the
object
of
this
intelligent
gazeteer
let
us
state
briefly
was
to
extract
from
his
victim
the
outlines
of
a
biography
which
would
cover
one
hundred
lines
he
could
not
have
fallen
on
a
subject
more
willing
to
submit
to
vivisection
erik
had
been
eager
to
tell
the
truth
and
to
proclaim
to
the
world
that
he
did
not
deserve
to
be
regarded
as
a
second
christopher
columbus
he
therefore
related
unreservedly
his
story
explaining
how
he
had
been
picked
up
at
sea
by
a
poor
fisherman
of
noroe
educated
by
malarius
taken
to
stockholm
by
schwaryencrona
how
they
had
found
out
that
patrick
probably
held
the
key
to
the
mystery
that
surrounded
him
they
discovered
that
he
was
on
board
of
the
vega
they
had
gone
in
search
of
him
he
related
the
accident
which
had
induced
them
to
change
their
route
erik
told
all
this
to
convince
the
world
that
he
was
no
hero
he
told
it
because
he
felt
ashamed
of
being
so
overwhelmed
with
praises
for
a
performance
that
only
seemed
to
him
natural
and
right
during
this
time
the
pen
of
the
delighted
reporter
squirrelius
flew
over
the
paper
with
stenographic
rapidity
the
dates
the
names
the
least
details
were
noted
with
avidity
squirrelius
told
himself
with
a
beating
heart
that
he
had
obtained
matter
not
only
for
one
hundred
lines
but
that
he
could
make
five
or
six
hundred
out
of
it
and
what
a
story
it
would
be
more
interesting
than
a
novel
the
next
day
erik
revelations
filled
the
columns
of
the
most
largely
circulated
newspaper
in
stockholm
and
indeed
in
all
sweden
as
is
usually
the
case
erik
sincerity
instead
of
diminishing
his
popularity
only
increased
it
on
account
of
his
modesty
and
the
romantic
interest
attached
to
his
history
the
press
and
the
public
seized
upon
it
with
avidity
these
biographical
details
were
soon
translated
into
all
languages
and
made
the
tour
of
europe
in
this
way
they
reached
paris
and
penetrated
in
the
form
of
a
french
newspaper
into
a
modest
on
varennes
street
there
were
two
persons
in
this
room
one
was
a
lady
dressed
in
black
with
white
hair
although
she
still
appeared
to
be
young
but
her
whole
appearance
betrayed
profound
sorrow
seated
under
a
lighted
lamp
she
worked
mechanically
at
some
embroidery
which
at
times
fell
from
her
thin
fingers
while
her
eyes
fixed
on
vacancy
seemed
to
be
thinking
of
some
overwhelming
calamity
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
sat
a
old
gentleman
who
took
the
newspaper
abstractedly
which
his
servant
brought
in
it
was
durrien
the
honorary
of
the
geographical
society
the
same
person
who
had
been
at
brest
when
the
alaska
reached
that
place
this
was
doubtless
the
reason
why
erik
name
attracted
his
notice
but
while
reading
the
article
carefully
which
contained
the
biography
for
the
young
swedish
navigator
he
was
startled
then
he
read
it
again
carefully
and
little
by
little
an
intense
pallor
spread
over
his
face
which
was
always
pale
his
hands
trembled
nervously
and
his
uneasiness
became
so
evident
that
his
companion
noticed
it
father
are
you
suffering
she
asked
with
solicitude
i
believe
it
is
too
warm
here
i
will
go
to
the
library
and
get
some
fresh
air
it
is
nothing
it
will
pass
off
answered
durrien
rising
and
walking
into
the
adjoining
room
as
if
by
accident
he
carried
the
paper
with
him
if
his
daughter
could
have
read
his
thoughts
she
would
have
known
that
amidst
the
tumults
of
hopes
and
fears
that
so
agitated
him
was
also
a
determination
not
to
let
her
eyes
rest
upon
that
paper
a
moment
later
she
thought
of
following
him
into
the
library
but
she
imagined
that
he
wished
to
be
alone
and
discreetly
yielded
to
his
desire
besides
she
was
soon
reassured
by
hearing
him
moving
about
and
opening
and
closing
the
window
at
the
end
of
an
hour
she
decided
to
look
in
and
see
what
durrien
was
doing
she
found
that
he
was
seated
before
his
desk
writing
a
letter
but
she
did
not
see
that
us
he
wrote
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
chapter
xxi
a
letter
from
paris
since
his
return
to
stockholm
erik
had
received
every
day
from
all
parts
of
europe
a
voluminous
correspondence
some
learned
society
wished
for
information
on
some
point
or
wrote
to
congratulate
him
foreign
governments
wished
to
bestow
upon
him
some
honor
or
recompense
or
traders
solicited
some
favor
which
would
serve
their
interests
therefore
he
was
not
surprised
when
he
received
one
morning
two
letters
bearing
the
paris
postmark
the
first
that
he
opened
was
an
invitation
from
the
geographical
society
of
france
asking
him
and
his
companions
to
come
and
receive
a
handsome
medal
which
had
been
voted
in
a
solemn
conclave
to
the
navigators
of
the
first
circumpolar
periplus
of
the
arctic
seas
the
second
envelope
made
erik
start
he
looked
at
it
on
the
box
which
closed
it
was
a
medallion
upon
which
the
letters
were
engraved
surrounded
by
the
motto
semper
idem
these
initials
and
devices
were
also
stamped
in
the
corner
of
the
letter
enclosed
in
the
envelope
which
was
that
from
durrien
the
letter
read
as
follows
my
dear
child
let
me
call
you
this
in
any
case
i
have
just
read
in
a
french
newspaper
a
biography
translated
from
the
swedish
language
which
has
overcome
me
more
than
i
can
tell
you
it
was
your
account
of
yourself
you
state
that
you
were
picked
up
at
sea
about
years
ago
by
a
norwegian
fisherman
in
the
neighborhood
of
bergen
that
you
were
tied
to
a
buoy
bearing
the
name
of
that
the
especial
motive
of
your
arctic
voyage
was
to
find
a
survivor
of
the
vessel
of
that
name
ship
wrecked
in
october
and
then
you
state
that
you
have
returned
from
the
voyage
without
having
been
able
to
gain
any
information
about
the
matter
if
all
this
is
true
oh
what
would
i
not
give
if
it
is
true
i
ask
you
not
to
lose
a
moment
in
running
to
the
telegraph
office
and
letting
me
know
it
in
that
case
my
child
you
can
understand
my
impatience
my
anxiety
and
my
joy
in
that
case
you
are
my
grandson
for
whom
i
have
mourned
so
many
years
whom
i
believed
lost
to
me
forever
as
did
also
my
daughter
my
poor
daughter
who
at
the
tragedy
of
the
still
mourns
every
day
for
her
only
child
the
joy
and
consolation
at
first
of
her
widowhood
but
afterward
the
cause
of
her
despair
but
we
shall
see
you
again
alive
covered
with
glory
such
happiness
is
too
great
too
wonderful
i
dare
not
believe
it
until
a
word
from
you
authorizes
me
to
do
so
but
now
it
seems
so
probable
the
details
and
dates
agree
so
perfectly
your
countenance
and
manners
recall
so
vividly
those
of
my
unfortunate
upon
the
only
occasion
when
chance
led
me
into
your
society
i
felt
myself
mysteriously
drawn
toward
you
by
a
deep
and
sudden
sympathy
it
seems
impossible
that
there
should
be
no
reason
for
this
one
word
telegraph
me
one
word
i
do
not
know
how
to
exist
until
i
hear
from
you
will
it
be
the
response
that
i
wait
for
so
impatiently
can
you
bring
such
happiness
to
my
poor
daughter
and
myself
as
will
cause
us
to
forget
our
past
years
of
tears
and
mourning
durrien
honorary

de

paris
to
this
letter
was
added
one
of
explanation
that
erik
devoured
eagerly
it
was
also
in
durrien
handwriting
and
read
as
follows
i
was
the
french
consul
at
new
orleans
when
my
only
daughter
catherine
married
a
young
frenchman
george
durrien
a
distant
connection
and
like
ourselves
of
breton
origin
george
durrien
was
a
mining
engineer
he
had
come
to
the
united
states
to
explore
the
recently
discovered
mines
of
petroleum
and
intended
to
remain
several
years
i
received
him
into
my
family
he
being
the
son
of
a
dear
friend
and
when
he
asked
for
my
daughter
hand
i
gave
her
to
him
with
joy
shortly
after
their
marriage
i
was
appointed
consul
to
riga
and
my
being
detained
by
business
interests
in
the
united
states
i
was
obliged
to
leave
my
daughter
she
became
a
mother
and
to
her
son
was
given
my
christian
name
united
to
that
of
his
father
emile
henry
georges
six
months
afterward
my
was
killed
by
an
accident
in
the
mines
as
soon
as
she
could
settle
up
his
affairs
my
poor
daughter
only
twenty
years
of
age
embarked
at
new
york
on
the
for
hamburg
to
join
me
by
the
most
direct
route
on
the
of
october
the
was
shipwrecked
off
the
faroe
islands
the
circumstances
of
the
shipwreck
were
suspicious
and
have
never
been
explained
at
the
moment
of
the
disaster
when
the
passengers
were
taking
their
places
one
by
one
in
the
boat
my
little
grandson
seven
months
old
whom
his
mother
had
tied
to
a
buoy
for
safety
slipped
or
was
pushed
into
the
sea
and
was
carried
away
by
the
storm
and
disappeared
his
mother
crazed
by
this
frightful
spectacle
tried
to
throw
herself
into
the
sea
she
was
prevented
by
main
force
and
placed
in
a
fainting
condition
in
one
of
the
boats
in
which
were
three
other
persons
and
who
had
alone
escaped
from
the
shipwrecked
vessel
in
hours
this
boat
reached
one
of
the
faroe
islands
from
there
my
daughter
returned
to
me
after
a
dangerous
illness
which
lasted
seven
weeks
thanks
to
the
devoted
attentions
of
the
sailor
who
saved
her
and
who
brought
her
to
me
this
brave
man
john
denman
died
in
my
service
in
asia
minor
we
had
but
little
hope
that
the
baby
had
survived
the
shipwreck
i
however
sought
for
him
among
the
faroe
and
shetland
islands
and
upon
the
norwegian
coast
north
of
bergen
the
idea
of
his
cradle
floating
any
further
seemed
impossible
but
i
did
not
give
up
my
search
for
three
years
and
noroe
must
be
a
very
retired
spot
or
surely
some
inquiries
would
have
been
made
there
when
i
had
given
up
all
hope
i
devoted
myself
exclusively
to
my
daughter
whose
physical
and
moral
health
required
great
attention
i
succeeded
in
being
sent
to
the
orient
and
i
sought
by
traveling
and
scientific
enterprises
to
draw
off
her
thoughts
from
her
affliction
she
has
been
my
inseparable
companion
sharing
all
my
labors
but
i
have
never
been
able
to
lighten
her
incurable
grief
we
returned
to
france
and
we
now
live
in
paris
in
an
old
house
which
i
own
will
it
be
my
happiness
to
receive
there
my
grandson
for
whom
we
have
mourned
so
many
years
this
hope
fills
me
with
too
much
joy
and
i
dare
not
speak
of
it
to
my
daughter
until
i
am
assured
of
its
truth
for
if
it
should
prove
false
the
disappointment
would
be
too
cruel
is
monday
they
tell
me
at
the
that
by
next
saturday
i
can
receive
your
answer
erik
had
hardly
been
able
to
read
this
for
the
tears
would
obscure
his
sight
he
also
felt
afraid
to
yield
too
quickly
to
the
hope
which
had
been
so
suddenly
restored
to
him
he
told
himself
that
every
detail
coincided
the
dates
agreed
all
the
events
down
to
the
most
minute
particulars
he
hardly
dared
to
believe
however
that
it
could
be
true
it
was
too
much
happiness
to
recover
in
a
moment
his
family
his
own
mother
his
country
and
such
a
country
the
one
that
he
could
have
chosen
above
all
because
she
possessed
the
grandeur
the
graces
the
supreme
gifts
of
humanity
because
she
had
fostered
genius
and
the
civilization
of
antiquity
and
the
discoveries
and
inventions
of
modern
times
he
was
afraid
that
he
was
only
dreaming
his
hopes
had
been
so
often
disappointed
perhaps
the
doctor
would
say
something
to
dispel
his
illusions
before
he
did
anything
he
would
submit
these
facts
to
his
cooler
judgment
the
doctor
read
the
documents
attentively
which
he
carried
to
him
but
not
without
exclamations
of
joy
and
surprise
you
need
not
feel
the
slightest
doubt
he
said
when
he
had
finished
all
the
details
agree
perfectly
even
those
that
your
correspondent
omits
to
mention
the
initials
on
the
linen
the
device
engraved
on
the
locket
which
are
the
same
as
those
on
the
letter
my
dear
child
you
have
found
your
family
this
time
you
must
telegraph
immediately
to
your
grandfather
but
what
shall
i
tell
him
asked
erik
pale
with
joy
tell
him
that
you
will
set
out
by
express
to
go
and
embrace
him
and
your
mother
the
young
captain
only
took
time
to
press
the
hands
of
this
excellent
man
and
he
ran
and
jumped
into
a
cab
to
hasten
to
the
telegraph
office
he
left
stockholm
that
same
day
took
the
railroad
to
malmo
on
the
coast
of
sweden
crossed
the
strait
in
twenty
minutes
reached
copenhagen
took
the
express
train
through
to
holland
and
belgium
and
at
brussels
the
train
for
paris
on
saturday
at
seven
in
the
evening
exactly
six
days
after
durrien
had
posted
his
letter
he
had
the
joy
of
waiting
for
his
grandson
at
the
depot
as
soon
as
the
train
stopped
they
fell
into
each
other
arms
they
had
thought
so
much
about
each
other
during
these
last
few
days
that
they
both
felt
already
well
acquainted
my
mother
asked
erik
i
have
not
dared
to
tell
her
much
as
i
was
tempted
to
do
so
answered
durrien
and
she
knows
nothing
yet
she
suspects
something
she
fears
she
hopes
since
your
dispatch
i
have
done
my
best
to
prepare
her
for
the
joy
that
awaits
her
i
told
her
of
a
track
upon
which
i
had
been
placed
by
a
young
swedish
officer
the
one
whom
i
had
met
at
brest
and
of
whom
i
had
often
spoken
to
her
she
does
not
know
she
hesitates
to
hope
for
any
good
news
but
this
morning
at
breakfast
i
could
see
her
watching
me
and
two
or
three
times
i
felt
afraid
that
she
was
going
to
question
me
one
can
not
tell
something
might
have
happened
to
you
some
other
misfortune
some
sudden
mischance
so
i
did
not
dine
with
her
i
made
an
excuse
to
escape
from
a
situation
intolerable
to
me
without
waiting
for
his
baggage
they
departed
in
the
that
durrien
had
brought
mme
durrien
alone
in
the
parlor
in
varennes
street
awaited
impatiently
the
return
of
her
father
she
had
had
her
suspicions
aroused
and
was
only
waiting
until
the
dinner
hour
arrived
to
ask
for
an
explanation
for
several
days
she
had
been
disturbed
by
his
strange
behavior
by
the
dispatches
which
were
continually
arriving
and
by
the
double
meaning
which
she
thought
she
detected
beneath
all
he
said
accustomed
to
talk
with
him
about
his
lightest
thoughts
and
impressions
she
could
not
understand
why
he
should
seek
to
conceal
anything
from
her
several
times
she
had
been
on
the
point
of
demanding
a
solution
of
the
enigma
but
she
had
kept
silence
out
of
respect
for
the
evident
wishes
of
her
father
he
is
trying
to
prepare
me
for
some
surprise
doubtless
she
said
to
herself
he
is
sure
to
tell
me
if
anything
pleasant
has
occurred
but
for
the
last
two
or
three
days
especially
that
morning
she
had
been
impressed
with
a
sort
of
eagerness
which
durrien
displayed
in
all
his
manner
as
well
as
the
happy
air
with
which
he
regarded
her
insisting
in
hearing
over
and
over
again
from
her
lips
all
the
details
of
the
disaster
of
the
cynthia
which
he
had
avoided
speaking
of
for
a
long
time
as
she
mused
over
his
strange
behavior
a
sort
of
revelation
came
to
her
she
felt
sure
that
her
father
must
have
received
some
favorable
intelligence
which
had
revived
the
hope
of
finding
her
child
but
without
the
least
idea
that
he
had
already
done
so
she
determined
not
to
retire
that
night
until
she
had
questioned
him
closely
mme
durrien
had
never
definitely
renounced
the
idea
that
her
son
was
living
she
had
never
seen
him
dead
before
her
eyes
and
she
clung
to
the
hope
that
he
was
not
altogether
lost
to
her
she
said
that
the
proofs
were
insufficient
and
she
nourished
the
possibility
of
his
sudden
return
she
might
be
said
to
pass
her
days
waiting
for
him
thousands
of
women
mothers
of
soldiers
and
sailors
pass
their
lives
under
this
touching
delusion
durrien
had
a
greater
right
than
they
had
to
preserve
her
faith
in
his
existence
in
truth
the
tragical
scene
enacted
years
ago
was
always
before
her
eyes
she
beheld
the
cynthia
filling
with
water
and
ready
to
sink
she
saw
herself
tying
her
infant
to
a
large
buoy
while
the
passengers
and
sailors
were
rushing
for
the
boats
they
left
her
behind
she
saw
herself
imploring
beseeching
that
they
would
at
least
take
her
baby
a
man
took
her
precious
burden
and
threw
it
into
one
of
the
boats
a
heavy
sea
dashed
over
it
and
to
her
horror
she
saw
the
buoy
floating
away
on
the
crest
of
the
waves
she
gave
a
dispairing
cry
and
tried
to
jump
after
him
then
came
unconsciousness
when
she
awoke
she
was
a
prey
to
despair
to
fever
to
delirium
to
this
succeeded
increasing
grief
yes
the
poor
woman
recalled
all
this
her
whole
being
had
in
fact
received
a
shock
from
which
she
had
never
recovered
it
was
now
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
century
since
this
had
happened
and
durrien
still
wept
for
her
son
as
on
the
first
day
her
maternal
heart
so
full
of
grief
was
slowly
consuming
her
life
she
sometimes
pictured
to
herself
her
son
passing
through
the
successive
phases
of
infancy
youth
and
manhood
from
year
to
year
she
represented
to
herself
how
he
would
have
looked
how
he
was
looking
for
she
obstinately
clung
to
her
belief
of
the
possibility
of
his
return
this
vain
hope
nothing
had
as
yet
had
the
power
to
shake
neither
travels
nor
useless
researches
nor
the
passage
of
time
this
is
why
this
evening
she
awaited
her
father
with
the
firm
resolution
of
knowing
all
that
he
had
to
tell
darrien
entered
he
was
followed
by
a
young
gentleman
whom
he
presented
to
her
in
the
following
words
my
daughter
this
is
erik
hersebom
of
whom
i
have
often
spoken
to
you
and
who
has
just
arrived
at
paris
the
geographical
society
wish
to
bestow
upon
him
a
grand
medal
and
he
has
done
me
the
honor
to
accept
our
hospitality
she
had
arisen
from
her
and
was
looking
kindly
at
him
suddenly
her
eyes
dilated
her
lips
trembled
and
she
stretched
out
her
hands
toward
him
my
son
you
are
my
son
she
cried
then
she
advanced
a
step
toward
erik
yes
you
are
my
child
she
said
your
father
lives
over
again
in
you
when
erik
bursting
into
tears
fell
on
his
knees
before
her
the
poor
woman
took
his
head
in
her
hands
and
fainted
from
joy
and
happiness
as
she
tried
to
press
a
kiss
on
his
forehead
chapter
xxii
at
a
month
later
at
an
old
homestead
of
the
family
situated
half
a
league
from
brest
erik
adopted
family
were
assembled
together
with
his
mother
and
grandfather
durrien
had
with
the
delicacy
of
feeling
habitual
to
her
desired
that
the
good
beings
who
had
saved
her
son
life
should
share
her
profound
and
inexpressible
joy
she
had
insisted
that
dame
katrina
and
vanda
hersebom
and
otto
should
accompany
doctor
schwaryencrona
kajsa
bredejord
and
malarius
and
they
held
a
great
festival
together
amidst
the
rugged
natural
scenery
of
breton
and
near
the
sea
her
norwegian
guests
felt
more
at
their
ease
than
they
could
have
done
in
varennes
street
they
took
long
walks
in
the
woods
together
and
told
each
other
all
they
knew
about
erik
still
somewhat
obscure
history
and
little
by
little
many
hitherto
inexplicable
points
became
clear
their
long
talks
and
discussions
cast
light
upon
many
obscure
circumstances
the
first
question
they
asked
each
other
was
who
was
tudor
brown
what
great
interest
did
he
have
in
preventing
patrick
from
telling
who
erik
relations
were
the
words
of
that
unfortunate
man
had
established
one
fact
that
tudor
brown
real
name
was
jones
as
it
was
the
only
one
that
the
irishman
had
known
him
by
now
a
noah
jones
had
been
associated
with
erik
father
in
working
a
petroleum
mine
that
the
young
engineer
had
discovered
in
pennsylvania
the
simple
announcement
of
this
fact
gave
a
sinister
aspect
to
many
events
which
had
so
long
appeared
mysterious
the
suspicious
wreck
of
the
cynthia
the
fall
of
the
infant
into
the
sea
perhaps
the
death
of
erik
father
a
document
that
durrien
found
among
his
papers
elucidated
many
of
these
perplexing
questions
several
months
before
his
marriage
he
said
to
erik
friends
my
had
discovered
near
harrisburg
a
petroleum
well
he
lacked
the
capital
necessary
to
purchase
it
and
he
saw
that
he
was
in
danger
of
losing
all
the
advantages
which
the
possession
of
it
would
secure
to
him
chance
made
him
acquainted
with
noah
jones
who
represented
himself
as
a
cattle
dealer
from
the
far
west
but
in
reality
as
he
found
out
afterward
he
was
a
this
individual
agreed
to
advance
the
sum
necessary
to
purchase
and
work
the
petroleum
mine
which
was
called
the
vandalia
he
made
my
sign
in
exchange
for
this
assistance
an
agreement
which
was
very
profitable
to
himself
i
was
ignorant
of
the
terms
of
this
contract
at
the
time
of
his
marriage
to
my
daughter
and
according
to
all
appearances
he
thought
but
little
of
it
unusually
gifted
and
understanding
chemistry
and
mechanics
yet
he
was
entirely
ignorant
of
business
matters
and
already
had
to
pay
dearly
for
his
inexperience
no
doubt
he
had
trusted
all
the
arrangements
to
noah
jones
according
to
his
usual
habit
probably
he
signed
with
closed
eyes
the
contract
which
was
laid
before
him
these
are
the
principle
articles
agreed
upon
art
iii
the
vandalia
shall
remain
the
sole
property
of
george
durrien
the
discoverer
and
noah
jones
his
silent
partner
art
iv
noah
jones
will
take
charge
of
moneys
and
pay
out
what
is
necessary
for
the
exploration
of
the
mine
he
will
also
sell
the
product
take
charge
of
the
receipts
and
have
a
settlement
with
his
partner
every
year
when
they
will
divide
the
net
profits
art
if
either
of
the
partners
should
wish
to
sell
his
share
the
other
would
have
the
first
right
to
purchase
it
and
he
should
have
three
months
in
which
to
make
arrangements
to
do
so
he
might
then
become
sole
proprietor
by
paying
the
capital
and
three
per
cent
on
the
net
revenue
according
to
what
it
had
been
proved
to
be
at
the
last
inventory
art
vi
only
the
children
of
the
two
partners
could
become
inheritors
of
these
rights
in
case
one
of
the
partners
should
die
childless
or
his
children
should
not
live
until
they
were
years
of
age
the
entire
property
to
revert
to
the
survivor
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
heirs
of
the
dead
partner
the
last
article
is
on
account
of
the
different
nationalities
of
the
two
partners
and
because
of
the
complications
that
could
not
fail
to
arise
in
case
of
the
death
of
either
of
them
without
issue
such
continued
durrien
was
the
contract
which
my
future
had
signed
at
the
time
when
he
had
no
thought
of
marrying
and
when
everybody
except
perhaps
noah
jones
was
ignorant
of
what
immense
value
the
vandalia
mine
would
become
in
the
course
of
time
they
had
then
hardly
commenced
operations
and
they
met
with
the
usual
discouragements
incident
to
all
new
undertakings
perhaps
noah
jones
hoped
that
his
associate
would
become
disgusted
with
the
whole
business
and
retire
leaving
him
sole
proprietor
the
marriage
of
george
with
my
daughter
the
birth
of
his
son
and
the
well
becoming
suddenly
prodigiously
fruitful
must
have
modified
his
plans
by
degrees
he
could
no
longer
hope
to
purchase
for
a
trifling
sum
this
splendid
property
but
before
it
came
into
the
possession
of
noah
jones
first
george
himself
and
then
his
only
child
must
disappear
from
the
world
two
years
after
his
marriage
and
six
months
after
the
birth
of
my
grandson
george
was
found
dead
near
one
of
the
wells
asphyxiated
the
doctors
said
by
gas
i
had
left
the
united
states
upon
my
nomination
as
consul
to
riga
the
business
relating
to
the
partnership
was
left
to
an
attorney
to
settle
noah
jones
behaved
very
well
and
agreed
to
all
the
arrangements
that
were
made
for
the
benefit
of
my
daughter
he
agreed
to
continue
the
work
and
pay
every
six
months
into
the
central
bank
of
new
york
that
part
of
the
net
profits
which
belonged
to
the
infant
alas
he
never
made
the
first
payment
my
daughter
took
passage
in
the
in
order
to
join
me
the
was
lost
with
her
crew
and
freight
under
such
suspicious
circumstances
that
the
insurance
company
refused
to
pay
and
in
this
shipwreck
the
sole
heir
of
my
disappeared
noah
jones
remained
the
sole
proprietor
of
the
vandalia
which
has
yielded
him
at
the
least
since
that
event
an
annual
income
of
one
hundred
and
eighty
thousand
dollars
a
year
did
you
never
suspect
that
he
had
had
some
hand
in
these
successive
catastrophies
asked
bredejord
i
have
certainly
suspected
him
it
was
only
too
natural
such
an
accumulation
of
misfortunes
and
all
tending
to
his
private
enrichment
seemed
to
point
him
out
as
the
author
only
too
clearly
but
how
could
i
prove
my
suspicions
particularly
in
a
court
of
justice
they
were
only
vague
and
i
knew
too
well
that
they
would
have
but
little
weight
in
an
international
contest
and
then
besides
i
had
my
daughter
to
console
or
at
least
to
try
and
draw
away
her
thoughts
from
this
tragedy
and
a
lawsuit
would
only
have
revived
her
grief
briefly
i
resigned
myself
to
silence
did
i
do
wrong
is
it
to
be
regretted
i
think
not
for
i
feel
convinced
that
it
would
have
produced
no
results
you
see
how
difficult
it
is
even
today
after
we
have
related
all
the
facts
in
our
possession
to
arrive
at
any
definite
conclusion
but
how
can
you
explain
the
part
which
patrick
has
taken
in
this
matter
asked
schwaryencrona
on
this
point
as
on
many
others
we
are
reduced
to
conjectures
but
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
one
which
is
plausible
enough
this
was
on
board
of
the
in
the
personal
service
of
the
captain
and
consequently
in
constant
communication
with
the
passengers
who
always
eat
at
the
captain
table
he
therefore
certainly
knew
the
name
of
my
daughter
and
her
french
origin
and
he
could
easily
have
found
her
again
had
he
been
commissioned
by
noah
jones
to
perform
some
dark
mission
had
he
a
hand
in
causing
the
shipwreck
of
the
or
simply
in
pushing
the
infant
into
the
sea
this
they
could
never
know
for
a
certainty
since
he
was
dead
one
thing
was
evident
he
was
aware
how
important
the
knowledge
of
this
fact
was
for
noah
jones
but
did
this
lazy
drunken
man
know
that
the
infant
was
living
had
he
any
hand
in
saving
it
had
he
rescued
it
from
the
sea
to
leave
it
floating
near
noroe
this
was
a
doubtful
point
in
any
case
he
must
have
assured
noah
jones
that
the
infant
had
survived
he
was
doubtless
proud
of
knowing
the
country
which
had
received
him
and
he
had
probably
taken
precautions
to
know
all
about
the
child
so
that
if
any
misfortune
happened
to
him
noah
jones
would
be
obliged
to
pay
him
well
for
his
silence
he
was
doubtless
the
person
from
whom
he
received
money
every
time
he
landed
in
new
york
all
this
appears
to
me
to
be
very
probable
said
bredejord
and
i
think
that
subsequent
events
confirm
it
the
first
advertisements
of
doctor
schwaryencrona
disturbed
noah
jones
and
he
believed
it
to
be
an
imperative
necessity
to
get
rid
of
patrick
but
he
was
obliged
to
act
prudently
he
therefore
contented
himself
with
frightening
the
irishman
by
making
him
believe
that
he
would
be
brought
before
a
criminal
court
the
result
of
this
we
know
from
and
bowles
of
the
red
anchor
who
told
us
of
the
haste
with
which
patrick
had
taken
flight
he
evidently
believed
that
he
was
in
danger
of
being
arrested
or
he
would
not
have
gone
so
far
to
live
among
the
samoyedes
and
under
an
assumed
name
which
noah
jones
had
doubtless
advised
him
to
do
but
the
announcement
in
the
newspapers
about
patrick
must
have
been
a
severe
blow
to
him
he
had
made
a
journey
to
stockholm
expressly
to
assure
us
that
the
irishman
was
dead
and
doubtless
to
discover
if
possible
how
far
we
had
pushed
our
inquiries
the
publication
of
the
correspondence
of
the
and
the
departure
of
the
must
have
made
noah
jones
or
tudor
brown
as
he
called
himself
feel
that
he
was
in
imminent
peril
for
his
confidence
in
patrick
could
be
only
very
limited
and
he
would
have
revealed
his
secret
to
any
one
who
would
have
assured
him
that
he
would
not
be
punished
happily
as
affairs
have
turned
out
we
may
congratulate
ourselves
upon
having
escaped
pretty
well
who
knows
said
the
doctor
perhaps
all
the
danger
we
have
encountered
has
only
helped
to
bring
us
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
but
for
running
on
the
rocks
of
the
we
would
probably
have
pursued
the
route
through
the
suez
canal
and
then
we
should
have
reached
behring
strait
too
late
to
meet
the
it
is
at
least
doubtful
whether
we
would
have
undertaken
the
voyage
to
the
island
of
ljakow
and
more
doubtful
still
whether
we
would
have
been
able
to
extract
any
information
from
patrick
if
we
had
met
him
in
company
with
tudor
brown
so
although
our
entire
voyage
has
been
marked
by
tragical
events
it
is
due
to
the
fact
of
our
having
accomplished
the
periplus
in
the
and
the
consequent
celebrity
which
has
been
the
result
for
erik
that
he
has
at
last
found
his
family
yes
said
durrien
laying
her
hand
proudly
on
the
head
of
her
son
it
is
his
glory
which
has
restored
him
to
me
and
immediately
she
added
it
was
a
crime
that
deprived
me
of
you
but
your
own
goodness
which
has
restored
you
to
me
and
the
rascality
of
noah
jones
has
resulted
in
making
our
erik
one
of
the
richest
men
in
america
cried
bredejord
every
one
looked
at
him
with
surprise
doubtless
answered
the
eminent
lawyer
erik
is
his
father
heir
and
has
a
share
in
the
income
derived
from
the
vandalia
mine
has
he
not
been
unjustly
deprived
of
this
for
the
last
years
we
have
only
to
give
proofs
of
his
identity
and
we
have
plenty
of
witnesses
hersebom
dame
katrina
and
malarius
besides
ourselves
if
noah
jones
has
left
any
children
they
are
responsible
for
the
enormous
arrears
which
will
probably
consume
all
their
share
of
the
capital
stock
if
the
rascal
has
left
no
children
by
the
terms
of
the
contract
which
durrien
has
just
read
erik
is
the
sole
inheritor
of
the
entire
property
and
according
to
all
accounts
he
ought
to
have
in
pennsylvania
an
income
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
to
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
a
year
ah
ah
said
the
doctor
laughing
behold
the
little
fisherman
of
noroe
become
an
eligible
laureate
of
the
geographical
society
author
of
the
first
circumpolar
periplus
and
afflicted
with
the
modest
income
of
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
there
are
not
many
such
husbands
to
be
met
with
in
stockholm
what
do
you
say
kajsa
the
young
girl
blushed
painfully
at
being
thus
addressed
but
her
uncle
had
no
suspicion
that
he
had
made
a
cruel
speech
kajsa
had
felt
that
she
had
not
acted
wisely
in
treating
erik
as
she
had
done
and
she
resolved
for
the
future
to
show
him
more
attention
but
it
was
a
singular
fact
that
erik
no
longer
cared
for
her
since
he
felt
himself
elevated
above
her
unjust
disdain
perhaps
it
was
absence
or
the
lonely
hours
which
he
had
spent
walking
the
deck
at
night
which
had
revealed
to
him
the
poverty
of
kajsa
heart
or
it
might
be
the
satisfaction
he
felt
that
she
could
no
longer
regard
him
as
a
waif
he
only
treated
her
now
with
the
most
perfect
courtesy
to
which
she
was
entitled
as
a
young
lady
and
schwaryencrona
niece
all
his
preference
now
was
for
vanda
who
indeed
grew
every
day
more
and
more
charming
and
was
losing
all
her
little
village
awkwardness
under
the
roof
of
an
amiable
and
cultivated
lady
her
exquisite
goodness
her
native
grace
and
perfect
simplicity
made
her
beloved
by
all
who
approached
her
she
had
not
been
eight
days
at
when
durrien
declared
positively
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
her
ever
to
part
with
her
erik
undertook
to
arrange
with
hersebom
and
dame
katrina
that
they
should
leave
vanda
behind
them
with
the
express
condition
that
he
would
bring
her
himself
every
year
to
see
them
he
had
tried
to
keep
all
his
adopted
family
with
him
even
offering
to
transport
from
noroe
the
house
with
all
its
furniture
where
he
had
passed
his
infancy
but
this
project
of
emigration
was
generally
regarded
as
impracticable
hersebom
and
katrina
were
too
old
to
change
their
habits
they
would
not
have
been
perfectly
happy
in
a
country
of
whose
language
and
habits
they
were
ignorant
he
was
obliged
therefore
to
permit
them
to
depart
but
not
before
making
such
provision
for
them
as
would
enable
them
to
spend
the
remainder
of
their
days
in
ease
and
comfort
which
notwithstanding
their
honest
laborious
lives
they
had
been
unable
to
accomplish
erik
would
have
liked
to
have
kept
otto
at
least
but
he
preferred
his
fiord
and
thought
that
there
was
no
life
preferable
to
that
of
a
fisherman
it
must
also
be
confessed
that
the
and
daughter
of
the
overseer
of
the
had
something
to
do
with
the
attractions
which
noroe
had
for
him
at
least
we
must
conclude
so
since
it
was
soon
made
known
that
he
expected
to
marry
her
at
the
next
yule
or
christmas
malarius
counted
upon
educating
their
children
as
he
had
educated
erik
and
vanda
he
modestly
resumed
his
position
in
the
village
school
after
sharing
in
the
honor
of
the
decorations
bestowed
by
the
geographical
society
of
france
upon
the
captain
of
the
alaska
he
was
also
busily
occupied
in
correcting
the
proofs
of
his
magnificent
work
on
the
flora
of
the
arctic
regions
as
for
schwaryencrona
he
has
not
quite
finished
his
treatise
on
iconography
which
will
transmit
his
name
to
posterity
the
latest
legal
business
of
bredejord
has
been
to
establish
claim
as
sole
proprietor
of
the
vandalia
mine
he
gained
his
case
in
the
first
instance
and
also
on
appeal
which
was
no
small
success
erik
took
advantage
of
this
and
of
the
enormous
fortune
thus
accruing
to
him
to
purchase
the
alaska
which
he
converted
into
a
pleasure
yacht
he
uses
it
every
year
to
go
to
noroe
in
company
with
mme
durrien
and
vanda
to
visit
his
adopted
family
although
his
civil
rights
have
been
accorded
to
him
and
his
legal
name
is
emile
durrien
he
has
added
that
of
hersebom
and
among
his
relatives
he
is
still
called
only
erik
the
secret
desire
of
his
mother
is
to
see
him
some
day
married
to
vanda
whom
she
already
loves
as
a
daughter
and
as
erik
evidently
shares
this
desire
we
may
suppose
that
it
will
be
realized
one
of
these
days
kajsa
still
remains
single
with
the
knowledge
that
she
has
lost
her
opportunity
schwaryencrona
bredejord
and
professor
hochstedt
still
play
innumerable
games
of
whist
one
evening
the
doctor
having
played
worse
than
usual
bredejord
as
he
tapped
his
had
the
pleasure
of
recalling
to
his
mind
a
circumstance
which
had
too
long
been
forgotten
when
do
you
intend
to
send
me
your
pliny
he
asked
with
a
wicked
gleam
in
his
eye
certainly
you
can
no
longer
think
that
erik
is
of
irish
origin
the
doctor
was
for
a
moment
by
this
speech
but
he
soon
recovered
himself
bah
an
of
the
french
republic
was
a
direct
descendant
of
one
of
the
irish
kings
he
said
seriously
i
should
not
be
at
all
surprised
if
durrien
belongs
to
the
same
family
evidently
replied
bredejord
in
fact
it
is
so
extremely
probable
that
out
of
sport
i
will
send
you
my
quintilian
the
end
