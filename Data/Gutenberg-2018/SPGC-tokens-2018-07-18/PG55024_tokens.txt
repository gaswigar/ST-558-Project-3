pushkin
alexander
sergueievitch
pushkin
came
of
a
noble
family
so
ancient
that
it
was
traced
back
to
that
alexander
nevsky
who
in
the
thirteenth
century
gained
a
great
victory
over
the
swedes
upon
the
ice
of
the
river
neva
in
token
whereof
he
was
surnamed
nevsky
of
the
neva
his
mother
nadejda
ossipovna
hannibal
was
the
of
abraham
petrovitch
hannibal
peter
the
great
famous
negro
his
father
surguei
lvovitch
pushkin
was
a
frivolous
man
of
pleasure
the
poet
was
born
on
the
of
may
at
moscow
he
was
an
awkward
and
a
silent
child
he
was
educated
by
french
tutors
a
poor
scholar
he
read
with
eagerness
whatever
he
could
get
in
his
library
chiefly
the
works
of
french
authors
his
brother
states
that
at
eleven
years
old
pushkin
knew
french
literature
by
heart
this
can
not
of
course
be
taken
literally
but
it
shows
under
what
influence
he
grew
up
in
october
he
entered
the
lyceum
of
tsarskoe
selo
among
the
students
a
society
was
soon
formed
whose
members
were
united
by
friendship
and
by
a
taste
for
literature
they
brought
out
several
periodicals
in
which
tales
and
poems
formed
the
chief
features
of
this
society
the
late
prince
gortchakoff
belonged
to
it
pushkin
was
the
leading
spirit
his
first
printed
poem
appeared
in
the
of
in
at
a
public
competition
in
at
which
the
veteran
poet
derjavin
was
present
pushkin
read
his
memories
of
tsarskoe
selo
this
poem
which
contains
many
beautiful
passages
so
delighted
derjavin
that
he
wished
to
embrace
the
young
author
but
pushkin
fled
in
confusion
from
the
hall
in
june
pushkin
free
and
careless
student
life
ended
after
finishing
his
course
at
the
lyceum
he
went
to
petersburg
and
though
he
entered
thoroughly
into
the
dissipated
pleasures
of
its
turbulent
youth
he
still
clung
to
the
intellectual
society
of
such
men
as
jukovsky
and
karamsin
men
occupied
in
literature
whose
friendship
he
valued
very
highly
at
that
time
society
was
much
disturbed
political
clubs
were
everywhere
being
formed
in
every
new
views
were
freely
and
openly
advanced
and
in
these
discussions
the
satire
and
brilliant
verse
of
pushkin
attracted
general
attention
these
at
last
brought
him
into
great
danger
but
karamsin
came
to
his
rescue
and
managed
to
get
him
an
appointment
at
ekaterinoslavl
in
the
office
of
the
chief
inspector
of
the
southern
settlements
there
he
remained
till
travelling
from
place
to
place
first
with
the
raevskys
to
the
caucasus
and
thence
again
with
them
through
the
crimea
this
journey
gave
him
materials
for
his
prisoner
of
the
caucasus
and
fountain
of
bachtchisarai
both
poems
reveal
the
influence
of
byron
towards
the
end
of
he
went
to
bessarabia
with
his
chief
who
had
just
been
appointed
viceroy
of
the
province
once
on
account
of
some
quarrel
this
person
insoff
by
name
sent
pushkin
to
ismail
there
the
poet
joined
a
band
of
gypsies
and
remained
with
them
for
some
time
in
the
steppes
in
he
went
to
odessa
having
been
transferred
to
the
office
of
the
new
count
vorontsoff
who
succeeded
insoff
here
he
wrote
part
of
evguenie
onegin
a
sort
of
russian
don
juan
full
of
sublime
passages
and
varied
by
satire
and
bitter
scorn
this
work
has
lately
been
formed
the
subject
of
a
very
successful
opera
by
tchaikovski
who
took
from
pushkin
poems
a
story
now
known
and
admired
by
every
educated
russian
the
poet
however
did
not
get
on
with
his
new
chief
a
scathing
epigram
upon
vorontsoff
led
the
count
to
ask
for
pushkin
removal
from
odessa
where
he
said
excessive
flattery
had
turned
the
young
maids
head
pushkin
had
to
resign
and
early
in
august
he
was
sent
into
retirement
to
live
under
the
supervision
of
the
local
authorities
at
michailovskoe
a
village
belonging
to
his
father
in
the
province
of
pskoff
here
the
elder
pushkin
kept
a
petty
watch
over
his
son
whom
he
regarded
as
a
perverted
nature
and
indeed
a
kind
of
monster
in
october
however
the
father
left
michailovskoe
and
the
poet
remained
alone
with
arina
rodionovna
an
old
woman
who
had
nursed
him
in
childhood
and
whose
tales
had
first
inspired
him
with
a
love
of
russian
popular
poetry
at
michailovskoe
pushkin
continued
his
evguenie
onegin
finished
the
gypsies
and
wrote
the
drama
of
boris
godunoff
here
he
lived
more
than
two
years
years
of
seclusion
following
a
long
period
of
town
life
and
dissipation
these
two
years
spent
in
the
simple
pleasant
company
of
country
neighbours
proved
a
turning
point
in
his
career
now
for
the
first
time
he
had
leisure
to
look
about
him
to
meditate
and
to
rest
he
had
come
into
the
country
with
a
passionate
love
for
everything
that
showed
the
feeling
or
fancy
of
the
russian
peasant
his
taste
for
popular
poetry
was
insatiable
he
listened
to
his
old
stories
collected
and
noted
down
songs
studied
the
habits
and
customs
of
russian
villages
and
began
a
serious
study
of
russian
history
all
this
helped
greatly
to
develop
the
popular
side
of
his
genius
he
afterwards
relinquished
his
earlier
models
of
the
romantic
school
and
sought
a
simpler
truer
inspiration
in
the
pages
of
shakespeare
writing
to
a
friend
bashkin
says
that
he
has
brought
up
from
the
country
to
moscow
the
two
last
cantos
of
evguenie
onegin
ready
for
the
press
a
poem
called
the
little
house
at
kolomna
and
several
dramatic
scenes
including
the
miser
knight
mozart
and
salieri
the
beast
during
the
plague
and
the
commander
statue
besides
that
he
goes
on
to
say
i
have
written
about
thirty
short
poems
nor
is
that
all
i
have
also
a
great
secret
written
some
prose
five
short
tales
fortunately
for
him
pushkin
was
living
in
the
country
when
in
december
the
insurrection
and
military
revolt
against
the
emperor
nicholas
who
had
just
ascended
the
throne
broke
out
at
petersburg
pushkin
was
affiliated
to
the
secret
society
with
pestle
and
ryleieff
at
its
head
which
had
organised
the
rebellion
and
on
receiving
a
summons
from
his
confederates
he
started
for
the
capital
so
at
least
says
alexander
herzen
in
his
curious
development
of
revolutionary
ideas
in
russia
on
leaving
his
country
house
pushkin
met
three
ill
omens
first
a
hare
crossed
his
path
next
he
saw
a
priest
and
finally
he
met
a
funeral
he
went
on
however
towards
moscow
and
there
learned
that
the
insurrection
had
been
crushed
the
five
principal
leaders
were
executed
and
whole
families
were
exiled
to
siberia
in
september
the
emperor
nicholas
had
an
interview
with
pushkin
at
moscow
pushkin
replied
simply
and
frankly
to
all
the
questions
and
the
latter
at
last
promised
in
future
to
be
himself
sole
censor
of
the
poet
works
pushkin
remained
at
moscow
till
about
the
end
of
the
winter
of
when
he
was
allowed
to
go
to
petersburg
there
he
afterwards
chiefly
resided
returning
sometimes
to
the
country
to
work
usually
in
autumn
when
his
power
of
production
he
said
was
strongest
in
the
summer
of
pushkin
visited
the
army
of
the
caucasus
then
operating
against
the
turks
he
describes
his
experiences
in
his
journey
to
erzeroum
on
the
of
february
he
married
natalia
nikolaevna
gontcharova
and
soon
afterwards
received
a
foreign
office
appointment
with
a
salary
of
roubles
in
august
meaning
to
write
a
novel
on
the
pugatcheff
insurrection
pushkin
paid
a
short
visit
to
kazan
and
orenburg
to
acquaint
himself
with
the
locality
and
collect
materials
but
his
tale
the
captain
daughter
appeared
considerably
later
pushkin
and
his
wife
were
invited
to
the
court
balls
and
the
emperor
was
very
gracious
and
attentive
to
the
poet
this
roused
the
jealousy
of
the
court
nobles
though
in
descent
pushkin
was
not
inferior
to
many
of
them
the
studied
hauteur
of
these
personages
caused
the
poet
much
irritation
and
led
him
to
waste
much
energy
on
petty
struggles
for
social
precedence
he
was
moreover
constantly
in
lack
of
means
to
meet
the
expenses
attending
his
position
partly
on
this
account
he
undertook
in
the
editorship
of
the
and
continued
it
until
his
death
in
the
four
numbers
issued
under
his
care
pushkin
published
original
articles
besides
the
translations
then
so
much
in
vogue
all
the
publications
of
that
time
were
made
to
serve
the
personal
aims
of
their
editor
it
was
useless
to
seek
in
them
impartiality
criticism
however
were
independent
and
for
this
reason
they
made
a
deep
impression
on
starting
his
review
he
had
taken
great
care
to
entrust
the
criticism
to
a
small
circle
of
the
most
accomplished
writers
pushkin
correspondence
throws
full
light
on
his
character
and
reveals
it
as
frank
sincere
and
independent
his
letters
show
that
he
had
original
ideas
on
literature
on
contemporary
politics
on
social
and
domestic
relations
and
in
short
on
every
subject
these
views
were
always
clear
and
independent
of
party
during
his
later
years
the
poet
felt
a
longing
for
the
country
as
early
as
he
petitioned
for
some
years
leave
in
order
that
he
might
retire
from
the
capital
in
his
last
poem
to
my
wife
he
says
how
weary
he
is
of
noisy
town
existence
and
how
he
longs
for
rest
at
the
end
of
scandals
were
circulated
at
petersburg
about
his
wife
dant√®s
von
heckeeren
an
officer
in
the
horse
guards
began
openly
to
pay
her
attention
pushkin
and
many
of
his
friends
received
anonymous
letters
maliciously
hinting
at
dant√®s
success
father
a
dissipated
old
man
threw
oil
upon
the
flames
meeting
madame
pushkin
in
society
he
did
his
best
to
make
her
quarrel
with
and
leave
her
husband
all
this
being
repeated
to
pushkin
greatly
incensed
him
he
challenged
young
heckeeren
but
the
latter
made
an
offer
to
madame
sister
and
married
her
this
did
little
to
mend
matters
pushkin
withdrew
the
challenge
but
nursed
his
hatred
for
dant√®s
and
would
not
receive
him
in
his
house
meanwhile
the
scandal
grew
and
the
two
heckeerens
continued
their
persecution
of
madame
pushkin
in
society
dant√®s
was
said
to
have
married
the
only
to
pay
court
to
the
wife
pushkin
always
convinced
of
his
wife
innocence
showed
for
her
the
tenderest
consideration
he
wrote
however
a
very
insulting
letter
to
old
heckeeren
after
which
a
duel
between
pushkin
and
the
son
became
inevitable
it
was
fought
on
the
banks
of
the
black
elver
near
the
commandant
of
petersburg
summer
residence
after
it
dant√®s
heckeeren
no
longer
able
to
remain
in
russia
resigned
his
commission
and
went
to
france
where
he
took
up
politics
and
as
baron
was
known
as
a
senator
in
the
second
empire
pushkin
was
already
wounded
in
the
body
when
he
fired
at
dant√®s
and
hit
the
arm
with
which
dant√®s
had
guarded
his
breast
at
six
in
the
afternoon
writes
jukovsky
to
the
father
alexander
was
brought
home
in
a
hopeless
condition
by
lieutenant
colonel
dansasse
the
old
schoolfellow
who
had
acted
as
his
second
the
butler
carried
him
from
the
carriage
into
the
house
it
grieves
you
my
friend
said
pushkin
to
see
me
thus
then
he
asked
for
clean
linen
while
he
was
undressing
madame
pushkin
not
knowing
what
had
happened
wished
to
come
in
but
her
husband
called
out
loudly
pas
il
y
a
du
monde
chez
he
was
afraid
of
alarming
her
she
was
not
admitted
till
he
was
already
lying
on
the
couch
how
happy
i
am
were
his
first
words
to
her
i
am
still
alive
with
you
by
my
side
be
comforted
you
are
not
to
blame
i
know
it
was
not
your
fault
meanwhile
he
did
not
let
her
know
that
his
wound
was
serious
doctors
were
sent
for
scholtz
and
sadler
came
pushkin
asked
everyone
to
leave
the
room
i
am
in
a
bad
way
he
said
holding
out
his
hand
to
scholtz
after
examining
him
sadler
went
off
to
fetch
the
necessary
instruments
left
alone
with
scholtz
pushkin
inquired
what
he
thought
of
his
condition
tell
me
candidly
you
are
in
danger
say
rather
that
i
am
dying
it
is
my
duty
not
to
conceal
from
you
even
that
replied
scholtz
but
we
shall
have
the
opinion
of
the
other
doctors
who
have
been
sent
for
vous
remercie
vous
avez
agi
en
honn√™te
homme
envers
moi
said
pushkin
adding
after
a
pause
faut
que
ma
do
you
wish
to
see
any
of
your
family
asked
scholtz
farewell
my
friends
said
pushkin
looking
towards
his
books
whether
at
that
moment
he
was
taking
leave
of
animate
or
inanimate
friends
i
know
not
after
another
pause
he
said
do
you
think
i
shall
not
last
another
hour
no
but
i
thought
you
might
like
to
see
some
of
your
friends
he
asked
for
several
when
spaski
another
doctor
came
near
and
tried
to
give
him
hope
pushkin
waved
his
hand
in
dissent
and
from
that
moment
apparently
ceased
to
think
about
himself
all
his
anxiety
was
for
his
wife
by
this
time
prince
and
princess
viasemsky
turgueneff
count
vielgorsky
and
myself
had
come
princess
viasemsky
was
with
the
wife
who
in
terrible
distress
glided
like
a
spectre
in
and
out
of
the
room
where
her
husband
lay
he
was
on
a
couch
with
his
back
to
the
window
and
door
and
unable
to
see
her
though
every
time
she
entered
or
merely
stood
in
the
doorway
he
was
conscious
of
it
is
my
wife
here
he
asked
take
her
away
he
was
afraid
to
let
her
come
near
him
lest
she
should
be
pained
by
his
sufferings
though
he
bore
them
with
wonderful
fortitude
what
is
my
wife
doing
he
asked
once
of
spaski
she
poor
thing
is
suffering
innocently
society
will
devour
her
i
have
been
in
thirty
battles
said
arendt
and
i
have
seen
many
men
die
but
very
few
like
him
it
was
strange
how
in
those
last
hours
of
his
existence
he
seemed
to
have
changed
the
storm
which
only
a
few
hours
before
had
raged
so
fiercely
in
him
had
disappeared
leaving
no
trace
behind
in
the
midst
of
his
suffering
he
recollected
that
he
had
the
day
before
received
an
invitation
to
attend
the
funeral
of
one
of
gretcheff
sons
if
you
see
gretcheff
he
said
to
spaski
give
him
my
kind
regards
and
tell
him
how
sincerely
i
sympathise
with
him
in
his
affliction
asked
to
confess
and
to
receive
the
sacrament
pushkin
assented
gladly
it
was
settled
that
the
priest
should
be
invited
to
come
in
the
morning
at
midnight
arendt
came
from
the
palace
where
he
had
been
to
inform
the
emperor
his
majesty
was
at
the
theatre
and
arendt
left
instructions
that
on
his
return
the
emperor
should
be
told
what
had
occurred
about
midnight
a
mounted
messenger
arrived
for
arendt
the
emperor
desired
him
to
go
at
once
to
pushkin
and
read
to
him
an
autograph
letter
which
the
messenger
brought
he
was
then
to
hasten
to
the
palace
and
report
upon
pushkin
condition
i
shall
not
go
to
bed
i
shall
wait
up
for
you
wrote
the
emperor
nicholas
and
bring
back
my
letter
the
note
was
as
follows
if
it
will
be
the
will
of
god
that
we
shall
not
meet
again
i
send
you
my
pardon
and
advise
you
to
receive
the
last
christian
rites
as
to
your
wife
and
children
they
need
cause
you
no
anxiety
i
take
them
under
my
own
protection
the
dying
man
immediately
complied
with
the
emperor
wish
a
priest
was
sent
for
from
the
nearest
church
pushkin
confessed
and
received
the
sacrament
with
great
reverence
when
arendt
read
the
letter
to
him
pushkin
took
hold
of
it
and
kissed
it
again
and
again
give
me
the
letter
i
wish
to
die
with
it
the
letter
where
is
the
letter
he
called
out
to
arendt
who
was
unable
to
leave
it
with
him
but
tried
to
pacify
him
by
promising
to
ask
the
emperor
permission
to
bring
it
back
again
at
five
in
the
morning
the
patient
anguish
grew
overpowering
the
sufferer
began
to
groan
and
arendt
was
again
sent
for
but
all
efforts
to
soothe
the
pain
were
futile
had
his
wife
heard
his
cries
i
am
sure
she
must
have
gone
mad
she
could
never
have
borne
the
agony
at
the
first
great
cry
of
pain
the
princess
viasemsky
who
was
in
the
room
rushed
towards
her
fearing
the
effect
but
madame
pushkin
lay
motionless
on
a
sofa
close
to
the
door
which
separated
her
from
her
husband
according
to
both
spaski
and
arendt
the
dying
man
stifled
his
cries
at
the
moment
of
supreme
anguish
and
only
groaned
in
fear
lest
his
wife
might
hear
him
and
suffer
to
the
last
pushkin
mind
remained
clear
and
his
memory
fresh
before
the
next
great
paroxysm
he
asked
for
a
paper
in
his
own
writing
and
had
it
burnt
then
he
dictated
to
dansasse
a
list
of
some
debts
but
this
exertion
prostrated
him
when
between
the
paroxysms
some
bread
sop
was
brought
he
said
to
spaski
my
wife
call
my
wife
let
her
give
it
me
she
entered
dropped
on
her
knees
by
his
side
and
after
lifting
a
couple
of
spoonfuls
to
his
mouth
leant
her
cheek
against
his
he
caressed
and
patted
her
head
come
come
he
said
i
am
all
right
thank
god
all
is
going
on
well
go
now
his
calm
expression
of
face
and
steady
voice
deceived
the
poor
wife
she
came
out
of
his
room
bright
with
hope
he
asked
for
his
children
they
were
brought
in
half
asleep
he
blessed
each
one
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
placing
his
hand
on
their
head
then
he
motioned
to
have
them
taken
away
afterwards
he
asked
for
his
friends
who
were
present
i
then
approached
and
took
his
hand
which
was
already
cold
and
inquired
if
i
should
give
any
message
to
the
emperor
say
that
i
am
sorry
i
am
leaving
him
i
should
have
been
devoted
to
him
on
the
of
january
at
three
in
the
afternoon
after
two
days
of
excruciating
pain
pushkin
died
his
death
was
regarded
throughout
russia
as
a
public
calamity
in
petersburg
disturbances
were
feared
it
was
thought
that
the
people
might
lynch
heckeeren
and
his
son
a
secret
funeral
was
arranged
the
body
was
carried
into
the
church
late
at
night
in
the
presence
of
some
friends
and
relations
and
in
the
neighbouring
courtyards
piquets
were
stationed
after
the
service
the
corpse
was
despatched
to
the
province
of
pskoff
and
was
buried
in
the
monastery
of
the
assumption
at
sviatogorsk
near
pushkin
property
at
michailovskoe
the
emperor
gave
about
roubles
to
pay
his
debts
and
to
bring
out
a
complete
edition
of
his
works
besides
granting
a
liberal
pension
to
the
widow
on
the
of
june
was
solemnly
unveiled
at
moscow
a
statue
of
pushkin
erected
by
voluntary
subscriptions
from
all
parts
of
russia
pushkin
was
slim
and
of
middle
height
in
childhood
his
hair
was
fair
and
curly
but
afterwards
it
turned
dark
brown
his
eyes
were
light
blue
his
smile
satirical
but
and
pleasant
his
clever
expressive
face
bore
evidence
of
his
african
descent
as
did
his
quick
and
passionate
nature
he
was
irritable
but
kind
and
full
of
feeling
his
conversation
sparkled
with
wit
and
good
humour
and
his
memory
was
prodigious
pushkin
it
has
already
been
said
was
of
ancient
lineage
but
no
russian
is
sufficiently
to
marry
into
the
imperial
family
and
when
quite
recently
the
grand
duke
michael
grandson
of
the
emperor
nicholas
married
without
permission
the
granddaughter
of
pushkin
he
caused
the
liveliest
dissatisfaction
in
the
highest
quarters
the
bride
may
console
herself
by
the
reflection
that
her
grandfather
was
in
the
words
of
gogol
a
rare
phenomenon
a
writer
who
gave
to
his
country
poems
so
admirable
that
they
attracted
the
attention
of
the
whole
civilised
world
a
poet
who
won
respect
and
love
for
the
language
for
the
living
russian
types
the
customs
and
national
character
of
russia
such
a
writer
is
indeed
a
rarity
the
queen
of
spades
chapter
i
there
was
a
card
party
at
the
rooms
of
narumoff
a
lieutenant
in
the
horse
guards
a
long
winter
night
had
passed
unnoticed
and
it
was
five
in
the
morning
when
supper
was
served
the
winners
sat
down
to
table
with
an
excellent
appetite
the
losers
let
their
plates
remain
empty
before
them
little
by
little
however
with
the
assistance
of
the
champagne
the
conversation
became
animated
and
was
shared
by
all
how
did
you
get
on
this
evening
surin
said
the
host
to
one
of
his
friends
oh
i
lost
as
usual
i
really
have
no
luck
i
play
you
know
that
i
keep
cool
nothing
moves
me
i
never
change
my
play
and
yet
i
always
lose
do
you
mean
to
say
that
all
the
evening
you
did
not
once
back
the
red
your
firmness
of
character
surprises
me
what
do
you
think
of
hermann
said
one
of
the
party
pointing
to
a
young
engineer
officer
that
fellow
never
made
a
bet
or
touched
a
card
in
his
life
and
yet
he
watches
us
playing
until
five
in
the
morning
it
interests
me
said
hermann
but
i
am
not
disposed
to
risk
the
necessary
in
view
of
the
superfluous
hermann
is
a
german
and
economical
that
is
the
whole
of
the
secret
cried
tomski
but
what
is
really
astonishing
is
the
countess
anna
fedotovna
how
so
asked
several
voices
have
you
not
remarked
said
tomski
that
she
never
plays
yes
said
narumoff
a
woman
of
eighty
who
never
touches
a
card
that
is
indeed
something
extraordinary
you
do
not
know
why
no
is
there
a
reason
for
it
just
listen
my
grandmother
you
know
some
sixty
years
ago
went
to
paris
and
became
the
rage
there
people
ran
after
her
in
the
streets
and
called
her
the
venus
richelieu
made
love
to
her
and
my
grandmother
makes
out
that
by
her
rigorous
demeanour
she
almost
drove
him
to
suicide
in
those
days
women
used
to
play
at
faro
one
evening
at
the
court
she
lost
on
to
the
duke
of
orleans
a
very
considerable
sum
when
she
got
home
my
grandmother
removed
her
beauty
spots
took
off
her
hoops
and
in
this
tragic
costume
went
to
my
grandfather
told
him
of
her
misfortune
and
asked
him
for
the
money
she
had
to
pay
my
grandfather
now
no
more
was
so
to
say
his
wife
steward
he
feared
her
like
fire
but
the
sum
she
named
made
him
leap
into
the
air
he
flew
into
a
rage
made
a
brief
calculation
and
proved
to
my
grandmother
that
in
six
months
she
had
got
through
half
a
million
rubles
he
told
her
plainly
that
he
had
no
villages
to
sell
in
paris
his
domains
being
situated
in
the
neighbourhood
of
moscow
and
of
saratoff
and
finally
refused
point
blank
you
may
imagine
the
fury
of
my
grandmother
she
boxed
his
ears
and
passed
the
night
in
another
room
illustration
the
old
magician
came
at
once
the
next
day
she
returned
to
the
charge
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
condescended
to
arguments
and
explanations
in
vain
did
she
try
to
prove
to
her
husband
that
there
were
debts
and
debts
and
that
she
could
not
treat
a
prince
of
the
blood
like
her
coachmaker
all
this
eloquence
was
lost
my
grandfather
was
inflexible
my
grandmother
did
not
know
where
to
turn
happily
she
was
acquainted
with
a
man
who
was
very
celebrated
at
this
time
you
have
heard
of
the
count
of
germain
about
whom
so
many
marvellous
stories
were
told
you
know
that
he
passed
for
a
sort
of
wandering
jew
and
that
he
was
said
to
possess
an
elixir
of
life
and
the
philosopher
stone
some
people
laughed
at
him
as
a
charlatan
casanova
in
his
memoirs
says
that
he
was
a
spy
however
that
may
be
in
spite
of
the
mystery
of
his
life
germain
was
much
sought
after
in
good
society
and
was
really
an
agreeable
man
even
to
this
day
my
grandmother
has
preserved
a
genuine
affection
for
him
and
she
becomes
quite
angry
when
anyone
speaks
of
him
with
disrespect
it
occurred
to
her
that
he
might
be
able
to
advance
the
sum
of
which
she
was
in
need
and
she
wrote
a
note
begging
him
to
call
the
old
magician
came
at
once
and
found
her
plunged
in
the
deepest
despair
in
two
or
three
words
she
told
him
everything
related
to
him
her
misfortune
and
the
cruelty
of
her
husband
adding
that
she
had
no
hope
except
in
his
friendship
and
his
obliging
disposition
said
germain
after
a
few
moments
reflection
could
easily
advance
you
the
money
you
want
but
i
am
sure
that
you
would
have
no
rest
until
you
had
repaid
me
and
i
do
not
want
to
get
you
out
of
one
trouble
in
order
to
place
you
in
another
there
is
another
way
of
settling
the
matter
you
must
regain
the
money
you
have
lost
my
dear
friend
answered
my
grandmother
have
already
told
you
that
i
have
nothing
left
does
not
matter
answered
germain
to
me
and
i
will
explain
he
then
communicated
to
her
a
secret
which
any
of
you
would
i
am
sure
give
a
good
deal
to
possess
all
the
young
officers
gave
their
full
attention
tomski
stopped
to
light
his
turkish
pipe
swallowed
a
mouthful
of
smoke
and
then
went
on
that
very
evening
my
grandmother
went
to
versailles
to
play
at
the
queen
table
the
duke
of
orleans
held
the
bank
my
grandmother
invented
a
little
story
by
way
of
excuse
for
not
having
paid
her
debt
and
then
sat
down
at
the
table
and
began
to
stake
she
took
three
cards
she
won
with
the
first
doubled
her
stake
on
the
second
and
won
again
doubled
on
the
third
and
still
won
mere
luck
said
one
of
the
young
officers
what
a
tale
cried
hermann
were
the
cards
marked
said
a
third
i
do
think
so
replied
tom
ski
gravely
and
you
mean
to
say
exclaimed
narumoff
that
you
have
a
grandmother
who
knows
the
names
of
three
winning
cards
and
you
have
never
made
her
tell
them
to
you
that
is
the
very
deuce
of
it
answered
tomski
she
had
three
sons
of
whom
my
father
was
one
all
three
were
determined
gamblers
and
not
one
of
them
was
able
to
extract
her
secret
from
her
though
it
would
have
been
of
immense
advantage
to
them
and
to
me
also
listen
to
what
my
uncle
told
me
about
it
count
ivan
ilitch
and
he
told
me
on
his
word
of
honour
tchaplitzki
the
one
you
remember
who
died
in
poverty
after
devouring
millions
lost
one
day
when
he
was
a
young
man
to
zoritch
about
three
hundred
thousand
roubles
he
was
in
despair
my
grandmother
who
had
no
mercy
for
the
extravagance
of
young
men
made
an
exception
i
do
not
know
why
in
favour
of
tchaplitzki
she
gave
him
three
cards
telling
him
to
play
them
one
after
the
other
and
exacting
from
him
at
the
same
time
his
word
of
honour
that
he
would
never
afterwards
touch
a
card
as
long
as
he
lived
accordingly
tchaplitzki
went
to
zoritch
and
asked
for
his
revenge
on
the
first
card
he
staked
fifty
thousands
rubles
he
won
doubled
the
stake
and
won
again
continuing
his
system
he
ended
by
gaining
more
than
he
had
lost
but
it
is
six
it
is
really
time
to
go
to
bed
everyone
emptied
his
glass
and
the
party
broke
up
chapter
ii
the
old
countess
anna
fedotovna
was
in
her
seated
before
her
three
maids
were
in
attendance
one
held
her
pot
of
rouge
another
a
box
of
black
pins
a
third
an
enormous
lace
cap
with
flaming
ribbons
the
countess
had
no
longer
the
slightest
pretence
to
beauty
but
she
preserved
all
the
habits
of
her
youth
she
dressed
in
the
style
of
fifty
years
before
and
gave
as
much
time
and
attention
to
her
toilet
as
a
fashionable
beauty
of
the
last
century
her
companion
was
working
at
a
frame
in
a
corner
of
the
window
illustrated
seated
before
her
good
morning
grandmother
said
the
young
officer
as
he
entered
the
good
morning
mademoiselle
lise
grandmother
i
have
come
to
ask
you
a
favour
what
is
it
paul
i
want
to
introduce
to
you
one
of
my
friends
and
to
ask
you
to
give
him
an
invitation
to
your
ball
bring
him
to
the
ball
and
introduce
him
to
me
there
did
you
go
yesterday
to
the
princess
certainly
it
was
delightful
we
danced
until
five
in
the
morning
mademoiselle
eletzki
was
charming
my
dear
nephew
you
are
really
not
difficult
to
please
as
to
beauty
you
should
have
seen
her
grandmother
the
princess
daria
petrovna
but
she
must
be
very
old
the
princess
daria
petrovna
how
do
you
mean
old
cried
tomski
thoughtlessly
she
died
seven
years
ago
the
young
lady
who
acted
as
companion
raised
her
head
and
made
a
sign
to
the
officer
who
then
remembered
that
it
was
an
understood
thing
to
conceal
from
the
princess
the
death
of
any
of
her
contemporaries
he
bit
his
lips
the
countess
however
was
not
in
any
way
disturbed
on
hearing
that
her
old
friend
was
no
longer
in
this
world
dead
she
said
and
i
never
knew
it
we
were
maids
of
honour
in
the
same
year
and
when
we
were
presented
the
empress
and
the
old
countess
related
for
the
hundredth
time
an
anecdote
of
her
young
days
paul
she
said
as
she
finished
her
story
help
me
to
get
up
lisaveta
where
is
my
and
followed
by
the
three
maids
she
went
behind
a
great
screen
to
finish
her
toilet
tomski
was
now
alone
with
the
companion
who
is
the
gentleman
you
wish
to
introduce
to
madame
asked
lisaveta
narumoff
do
you
know
him
no
is
he
in
the
army
yes
in
the
engineers
no
in
the
horse
guards
why
did
you
think
he
was
in
the
engineers
the
young
lady
smiled
but
made
no
answer
paul
cried
the
countess
from
behind
the
screen
send
me
a
new
novel

matter
what
only
see
that
it
is
not
in
the
style
of
the
present
day
what
style
would
you
like
grandmother
a
novel
in
which
the
hero
strangles
neither
his
father
nor
his
mother
and
in
which
no
one
gets
drowned
nothing
frightens
me
so
much
as
the
idea
of
getting
drowned
illustration
paul
and
lisaveta

lisaveta
what
made
you
fancy
narumoff
was
in
the
engineers
and
tomski
took
his
departure
lisaveta
left
alone
took
out
her
embroidery
and
sat
down
close
to
the
window
immediately
afterwards
in
the
street
at
the
corner
of
a
neighbouring
house
appeared
a
young
officer
the
sight
of
him
made
the
companion
blush
to
her
ears
she
lowered
her
head
and
almost
concealed
it
in
the
canvas
at
this
moment
the
counters
returned
fully
dressed
lisaveta
she
said
have
the
horses
put
in
we
will
go
out
for
a
drive
lisaveta
rose
from
her
chair
and
began
to
arrange
her
embroidery
well
my
dear
child
are
you
deaf
go
and
tell
them
to
put
the
horses
in
at
once

replied
the
young
lady
as
she
went
out
into
the
a
servant
now
came
in
bringing
some
books
from
prince
paul
alexandrovitch
say
i
am
much
obliged
to
him
lisaveta
lisaveta
where

she
run
off
to
i
was
going
to
dress
we
have
plenty
of
time
my
dear
sit
down
take
the
first
volume
and
read
to
me
the
companion
took
the
book
and
read
a
few
lines
louder
said
the
countess
what
is
the
matter
with
you
have
you
a
cold
wait
a
moment
bring
me
that
stool
a
little
closer
that
will
do
lisaveta
read
two
pages
of
the
book
throw
that
stupid
book
away
said
the
countess
what
nonsense
send
it
back
to
prince
paul
and
tell
him
i
am
much
obliged
to
him
and
the
carriage
is
it
never
coming
here
it
is
replied
lisaveta
going
to
the
window
and
now
you
are
not
dressed
why
do
you
always
keep
waiting
it
is
intolerable
lisaveta
ran
to
her
room
she
had
scarcely
been
there
two
minutes
when
the
countess
rang
with
all
her
might
her
maids
rushed
in
at
one
door
and
her
valet
at
the
other
you
do
not
seem
to
hear
me
when
i
ring
she
cried
go
and
tell
lisaveta
that
i
am
waiting
for
her
at
this
moment
lisaveta
entered
wearing
a
new
walking
dress
and
a
fashionable
bonnet
at
last
miss
cried
the
countess
but
what
is
that
you
have
got
on
and
why
for
whom
are
you
dressing
what
sort
of
weather
is
it
quite
stormy
i
believe
no
your
excellency
said
the
valet
it
is
exceedingly
fine
what
do
you
know
about
it
open
the
ventilator
just
what
i
told
you
a
frightful
wind
and
as
icy
as
can
be
unharness
the
horses
lisaveta
my
child
we
will
not
go
out
it
was
scarcely
worth
while
to
dress
so
much
what
an
existence
said
the
companion
to
herself
lisaveta
ivanovna
was
in
fact
a
most
unhappy
creature
the
bread
of
the
stranger
is
bitter
says
dante
and
his
staircase
hard
to
climb
but
who
can
tell
the
torments
of
a
poor
little
companion
attached
to
an
old
lady
of
quality
the
countess
had
all
the
caprices
of
a
woman
spoilt
by
the
world
she
was
avaricious
and
egotistical
and
thought
all
the
more
of
herself
now
that
she
had
ceased
to
play
an
active
part
in
society
she
never
missed
a
ball
and
she
dressed
and
painted
in
the
style
of
a
bygone
age
she
remained
in
a
corner
of
the
room
where
she
seemed
to
have
been
placed
expressly
to
serve
as
a
scarecrow
every
one
on
coming
in
went
to
her
and
made
her
a
low
bow
but
this
ceremony
once
at
an
end
no
one
spoke
a
word
to
her
she
received
the
whole
city
at
her
house
observing
the
strictest
etiquette
and
never
failing
to
give
to
everyone
his
or
her
proper
name
her
innumerable
servants
growing
pale
and
fat
in
the
did
absolutely
as
they
liked
so
that
that
the
house
was
pillaged
as
if
its
owner
were
really
dead
lisaveta
passed
her
life
in
continual
torture
if
she
made
tea
she
was
reproached
with
wasting
the
sugar
if
she
read
a
novel
to
the
countess
she
was
held
responsible
for
all
the
absurdities
of
the
author
if
she
went
out
with
the
noble
lady
for
a
walk
or
drive
it
was
she
who
was
to
blame
if
the
weather
was
bad
or
the
pavement
muddy
her
salary
more
than
modest
was
never
punctually
paid
and
she
was
expected
to
dress
like
every
one
else
that
is
to
say
like
very
few
people
indeed
when
she
went
into
society
her
position
was
sad
everyone
knew
her
no
one
paid
her
any
attention
at
a
ball
she
sometimes
danced
but
only
when
a
was
wanted
women
would
come
up
to
her
take
her
by
the
arm
and
lead
her
out
of
the
room
if
their
dress
required
attending
to
she
had
her
portion
of
and
felt
deeply
the
misery
of
her
position
she
looked
with
impatience
for
a
liberator
to
break
her
chain
but
the
young
men
prudent
in
the
midst
of
their
affected
giddiness
took
care
not
to
honour
her
with
their
attentions
though
lisaveta
ivanovna
was
a
hundred
times
prettier
than
the
shameless
or
stupid
girls
whom
they
surrounded
with
their
homage
more
than
once
she
slunk
away
from
the
splendour
of
the
to
shut
herself
up
alone
in
her
little
furnished
with
an
old
screen
and
a
pieced
carpet
a
chest
of
drawers
a
small
and
a
wooden
bedstead
there
she
shed
tears
at
her
ease
by
the
light
of
a
tallow
candle
in
a
tin
candlestick
one
morning
it
was
two
days
after
the
party
at
narumoff
and
a
week
before
the
scene
we
have
just
sketched
lisaveta
was
sitting
at
her
embroidery
before
the
window
when
looking
carelessly
into
the
street
she
saw
an
officer
in
the
uniform
of
the
engineers
standing
motionless
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
her
she
lowered
her
head
and
applied
herself
to
her
work
more
attentively
than
ever
five
minutes
afterwards
she
locked
mechanically
into
the
street
and
the
officer
was
still
in
the
same
place
not
being
in
the
habit
of
exchanging
glances
with
young
men
who
passed
by
her
window
she
remained
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
her
work
for
nearly
two
hours
until
she
was
told
that
lunch
was
ready
she
got
up
to
put
her
embroidery
away
and
while
doing
so
looked
into
the
street
and
saw
the
officer
still
in
the
same
place
this
seemed
to
her
very
strange
after
lunch
she
went
to
the
window
with
a
certain
emotion
but
the
officer
of
engineers
was
no
longer
in
the
street
illustration
there
she
shed
tears
she
thought
no
more
of
him
but
two
days
afterwards
just
as
she
was
getting
into
the
carriage
with
the
countess
she
saw
him
once
more
standing
straight
before
the
door
his
face
was
half
concealed
by
a
fur
collar
but
his
black
eyes
sparkled
beneath
his
helmet
lisaveta
was
afraid
without
knowing
why
and
she
trembled
as
she
took
her
seat
in
the
carriage
on
returning
home
she
rushed
with
a
beating
heart
towards
the
window
the
officer
was
in
his
habitual
place
with
his
eyes
fixed
ardently
upon
her
she
at
once
withdrew
burning
at
the
same
time
with
curiosity
and
moved
by
a
strange
feeling
which
she
now
experienced
for
the
first
time
no
day
now
passed
but
the
young
officer
showed
himself
beneath
the
window
before
long
a
dumb
acquaintance
was
established
between
them
sitting
at
her
work
she
felt
his
presence
and
when
she
raised
her
head
she
looked
at
him
for
a
long
time
every
day
the
young
man
seemed
full
of
gratitude
for
these
innocent
favours
she
observed
with
the
deep
and
rapid
perceptions
of
youth
that
a
sudden
redness
covered
the
officer
pale
cheeks
as
soon
as
their
eyes
met
after
about
a
week
she
would
smile
at
seeing
him
for
the
first
time
when
tomski
asked
his
grandmother
permission
to
present
one
of
his
friends
the
heart
of
the
poor
young
girl
beat
strongly
and
when
she
heard
that
it
was
narumoff
she
bitterly
repented
having
compromised
her
secret
by
letting
it
out
to
a
giddy
young
man
like
paul
hermann
was
the
son
of
a
german
settled
in
russia
from
whom
he
had
inherited
a
small
sum
of
money
firmly
resolved
to
preserve
his
independence
he
had
made
it
a
principle
not
to
touch
his
private
income
he
lived
on
his
pay
and
did
not
allow
himself
the
slightest
luxury
he
was
not
very
communicative
and
his
reserve
rendered
it
difficult
for
his
comrades
to
amuse
themselves
at
his
expense
under
an
assumed
calm
he
concealed
strong
passions
and
a
disposition
but
he
was
always
master
of
himself
and
kept
himself
free
from
the
ordinary
faults
of
young
men
thus
a
gambler
by
temperament
he
never
touched
a
card
feeling
as
he
himself
said
that
his
position
did
not
allow
him
to
risk
the
necessary
in
view
of
the
superfluous
yet
he
would
pass
entire
nights
before
a
watching
with
feverish
anxiety
the
rapid
changes
of
the
game
the
anecdote
of
count
germaines
three
cards
had
struck
his
imagination
and
he
did
nothing
but
think
of
it
all
that
night
if
he
said
to
himself
next
day
as
he
was
walking
along
the
streets
of
petersburg
if
she
would
only
tell
me
her
secret
if
she
would
only
name
the
three
winning
cards
i
must
get
presented
to
her
that
i
may
pay
my
court
and
gain
her
confidence
yes
and
she
is
she
may
die
this
week
perhaps
but
after
all
is
there
a
word
of
truth
in
the
story
no
economy
temperance
work
these
are
my
three
winning
cards
with
them
i
can
double
my
capital
increase
it
tenfold
they
alone
can
ensure
my
independence
and
prosperity
dreaming
in
this
way
as
he
walked
along
his
attention
was
attracted
by
a
house
built
in
an
antiquated
style
of
architecture
the
street
was
full
of
carriages
which
passed
one
by
one
before
the
old
house
now
brilliantly
illuminated
as
the
people
stepped
out
of
the
carriages
hermann
saw
now
the
little
feet
of
a
young
woman
now
the
military
boot
of
a
general
then
came
a
clocked
stocking
then
again
a
diplomatic
pump
cloaks
and
coats
passed
in
procession
before
a
gigantic
porter
hermann
stopped
who
lives
here
he
said
to
a
watchman
in
his
box
the
countess
anna
fedotovna
it
was
tomski
grandmother
hermann
started
the
story
of
the
three
cards
came
once
more
upon
his
imagination
he
walked
to
and
fro
before
the
house
thinking
of
the
woman
to
whom
it
belonged
of
her
wealth
and
her
mysterious
power
at
last
he
returned
to
his
den
but
for
some
time
he
could
not
get
to
sleep
and
when
at
last
sleep
came
upon
him
he
saw
dancing
before
his
eyes
cards
a
green
table
and
heaps
of
rubles
and
he
saw
himself
doubling
stake
after
stake
always
winning
and
then
filling
his
pockets
with
piles
of
coin
and
stuffing
his
with
countless
when
he
awoke
he
sighed
to
find
that
his
treasures
were
but
creations
of
a
disordered
fancy
and
to
drive
such
thoughts
from
him
he
went
out
for
a
walk
but
he
had
not
gone
far
when
he
found
himself
once
more
before
the
house
of
the
countess
he
seemed
to
have
been
attracted
there
by
some
irresistible
force
he
stopped
and
looked
up
at
the
windows
there
he
saw
a
girl
head
with
beautiful
black
hair
leaning
gracefully
over
a
book
or
an
the
head
was
lifted
and
he
saw
a
fresh
complexion
and
black
eyes
this
moment
decided
his
fate
chapter
iii
lisaveta
was
just
taking
off
her
shawl
and
her
bonnet
when
the
countess
sent
for
her
she
had
had
the
horses
put
in
again
while
two
footmen
were
helping
the
old
lady
into
the
carriage
lisaveta
saw
the
young
officer
at
her
side
she
felt
him
take
her
by
the
hand
lost
her
head
and
found
when
the
young
officer
had
walked
away
that
he
had
left
a
paper
between
her
fingers
she
hastily
concealed
it
in
her
glove
during
the
whole
of
the
drive
she
neither
saw
nor
heard
when
they
were
in
the
carriage
together
the
countess
was
in
the
habit
of
questioning
lisaveta
perpetually
who
is
that
man
that
bowed
to
us
what
is
the
name
of
this
bridge
what
is
there
written
on
that
signboard
lisaveta
now
gave
the
most
absurd
answers
and
was
accordingly
scolded
by
the
countess
what
is
the
matter
with
you
my
child
she
asked
what
are
you
thinking
about
or
do
you
really
not
hear
me
i
speak
distinctly
enough
however
and
i
have
not
yet
lost
my
head
have
i
lisaveta
was
not
listening
when
she
got
back
to
the
house
she
ran
to
her
room
locked
the
door
and
took
the
scrap
of
paper
from
her
glove
it
was
not
sealed
and
it
was
impossible
therefore
not
to
read
it
the
letter
contained
protestations
of
love
it
was
tender
respectful
and
translated
word
for
word
from
a
german
novel
but
lisaveta
did
not
read
german
and
she
was
quite
delighted
she
was
however
much
embarrassed
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
had
a
secret
correspond
with
a
young
man
the
idea
of
such
a
thing
frightened
her
how
imprudent
she
had
been
she
had
reproached
herself
but
knew
not
now
what
to
do
cease
to
do
her
work
at
the
window
and
by
persistent
coldness
try
and
disgust
the
officer
send
him
back
his
letter
answer
him
in
a
firm
decided
manner
what
line
of
conduct
was
she
to
pursue
she
had
no
friend
no
one
to
advise
her
she
at
last
decided
to
send
an
answer
she
sat
down
at
her
little
table
took
pen
and
paper
and
began
to
think
more
than
once
she
wrote
a
sentence
and
then
tore
up
the
paper
what
she
had
written
seemed
too
stiff
or
else
it
was
wanting
in
reserve
at
last
after
much
trouble
she
succeeded
in
composing
a
few
lines
which
seemed
to
meet
the
case
i
believe
she
wrote
that
your
intentions
are
those
of
an
honourable
man
and
that
you
would
not
wish
to
offend
me
by
any
thoughtless
conduct
but
you
must
understand
that
our
acquaintance
can
not
begin
in
this
way
i
return
your
letter
and
trust
that
you
will
not
give
me
cause
to
regret
my
imprudence
next
day
as
soon
as
hermann
made
his
appearance
lisaveta
left
her
embroidery
and
went
into
the
opened
the
ventilator
and
threw
her
letter
into
the
street
making
sure
that
the
young
officer
would
pick
it
up
illustration
she
tore
it
into
a
hundred
pieces
hermann
in
fact
at
once
saw
it
and
picking
it
up
entered
a
confectioner
shop
in
order
to
read
it
finding
nothing
discouraging
in
it
he
went
home
sufficiently
pleased
with
the
first
step
in
his
love
adventure
some
days
afterwards
a
young
person
with
lively
eyes
called
to
see
miss
lisaveta
on
the
part
of
a
milliner
lisaveta
wondered
what
she
could
want
and
suspected
as
she
received
her
some
secret
intention
she
was
much
surprised
however
when
she
recognised
on
the
letter
that
was
now
handed
to
her
the
writing
of
hermann
you
make
a
mistake
she
said
this
letter
is
not
for
me
i
beg
your
pardon
said
the
milliner
with
a
slight
smile
be
kind
enough
to
read
it
lisaveta
glanced
at
it
hermann
was
asking
for
an
appointment
impossible
she
cried
alarmed
both
at
the
boldness
of
the
request
and
at
the
manner
in
which
it
was
made
this
letter
is
not
for
me
she
repeated
and
she
tore
it
into
a
hundred
pieces
if
the
letter
was
not
for
you
why
did
you
tear
it
up
you
should
have
given
it
me
back
that
i
might
take
it
to
the
person
it
was
meant
for
true
said
lisaveta
quite
disconcerted
but
bring
me
no
more
letters
and
tell
the
person
who
gave
you
this
one
that
he
ought
to
blush
for
his
conduct
hermann
however
was
not
a
man
to
give
up
what
he
had
once
undertaken
every
day
lisaveta
received
a
fresh
letter
from
him
sent
now
in
one
way
now
in
another
they
were
no
longer
translated
from
the
german
hermann
wrote
under
the
influence
of
a
commanding
passion
and
spoke
a
language
which
was
his
own
lisaveta
could
not
hold
out
against
such
torrents
of
eloquence
she
received
the
letters
kept
them
and
at
last
answered
them
every
day
her
answers
were
longer
and
more
affectionate
until
at
last
she
threw
out
of
the
window
a
letter
couched
as
follows
this
evening
there
is
a
ball
at
the
embassy
the
countess
will
be
there
we
shall
remain
until
two
in
the
morning
you
may
manage
to
see
me
alone
as
soon
as
the
countess
leaves
home
that
is
to
say
towards
eleven
the
servants
are
sure
to
go
out
and
there
will
be
no
one
left
but
the
porter
who
will
be
sure
to
be
asleep
in
his
box
enter
as
soon
as
it
strikes
eleven
and
go
upstairs
as
fast
as
possible
if
you
find
anyone
in
the
ask
whether
the
countess
is
at
home
and
you
will
be
told
that
she
is
out
and
in
that
case
you
must
resign
yourself
and
go
away
in
all
probability
however
you
will
meet
no
one
the
countess
women
are
together
in
a
distant
room
when
you
are
once
in
the
turn
to
the
left
and
walk
straight
on
until
you
reach
the
countess
bedroom
there
behind
a
large
screen
you
will
see
two
doors
the
one
on
the
right
leads
to
a
dark
room
the
one
on
the
left
leads
to
a
corridor
at
the
end
of
which
is
a
little
winding
staircase
which
leads
to
my
parlour
at
ten
hermann
was
already
on
duty
before
the
countess
door
it
was
a
frightful
night
the
winds
had
been
unloosed
and
the
snow
was
falling
in
large
flakes
the
lamps
gave
an
uncertain
light
the
streets
were
deserted
from
time
to
time
passed
a
sledge
drawn
by
a
wretched
hack
on
the
for
a
fare
covered
by
a
thick
overcoat
hermann
felt
neither
the
wind
nor
the
snow
at
last
the
countesses
carriage
drew
up
he
saw
two
huge
footmen
come
forward
and
take
beneath
the
arms
a
dilapidated
spectre
and
place
it
on
the
cushions
well
wrapped
up
in
an
enormous
fur
cloak
immediately
afterwards
in
a
cloak
of
lighter
make
her
head
crowned
with
natural
flowers
came
lisaveta
who
sprang
into
the
carriage
like
a
dart
the
door
was
closed
and
the
carriage
rolled
on
softly
over
the
snow
the
porter
closed
the
street
door
and
soon
the
windows
of
the
first
floor
became
dark
silence
reigned
throughout
the
house
hermann
walked
backwards
and
forwards
then
coming
to
a
lamp
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
twenty
minutes
to
eleven
leaning
against
the
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
long
hand
of
his
watch
he
counted
impatiently
the
minutes
which
had
yet
to
pass
at
eleven
precisely
hermann
walked
up
the
steps
pushed
open
the
street
door
and
went
into
the
vestibule
which
was
well
lighted
as
it
happened
the
porter
was
not
there
with
a
firm
and
rapid
step
he
rushed
up
the
staircase
and
reached
the
there
before
a
lamp
a
footman
was
sleeping
stretched
out
in
a
dirty
greasy
hermann
passed
quickly
before
him
and
crossed
the
and
the
where
there
was
no
light
but
the
lamp
of
the
helped
him
to
see
at
last
he
reached
the
countess
bedroom
before
a
screen
covered
with
old
icons
sacred
pictures
a
golden
lamp
was
burning
gilt
sofas
of
faded
colours
furnished
with
soft
cushions
were
arranged
symmetrically
along
the
walls
which
were
hung
with
china
silk
he
saw
two
large
portraits
painted
by
madame
le
brun
one
represented
a
man
of
forty
stout
and
full
coloured
dressed
in
a
light
green
coat
with
a
decoration
on
his
breast
the
second
portrait
was
that
of
an
elegant
young
woman
with
an
aquiline
nose
powdered
hair
rolled
back
on
the
temples
and
with
a
rose
over
her
ear
everywhere
might
be
seen
shepherds
and
shepherdesses
in
dresden
china
with
vases
of
all
shapes
clocks
by
leroy
fans
and
all
the
thousand
playthings
for
the
use
of
ladies
of
fashion
discovered
in
the
last
century
at
the
time
of
montgolfier
balloons
and
mesmer
animal
magnetism
illustration
a
footman
in
a
greasy
dressing
gown
hermann
passed
behind
the
screen
which
concealed
a
little
iron
bedstead
he
saw
the
two
doors
the
one
on
the
right
leading
to
the
dark
room
the
one
on
the
left
to
the
corridor
he
opened
the
latter
saw
the
staircase
which
led
to
the
poor
little
companion
parlour
and
then
closing
this
door
went
into
the
dark
room
the
time
passed
slowly
everything
was
quiet
in
the
house
the
clock
struck
midnight
and
again
there
was
silence
hermann
was
standing
up
leaning
against
the
stove
in
which
there
was
no
fire
he
was
calm
but
his
heart
beat
with
quick
pulsations
like
that
of
a
man
determined
to
brave
all
dangers
he
might
have
to
meet
because
he
knows
them
to
be
inevitable
he
heard
one
strike
then
two
and
soon
afterwards
the
distant
roll
of
a
carriage
he
now
in
spite
of
himself
experienced
some
emotion
the
carriage
approached
rapidly
and
stopped
there
was
at
once
a
great
noise
of
servants
running
about
the
staircases
and
a
confusion
of
voices
suddenly
the
rooms
were
all
lit
up
and
the
countess
three
antiquated
maids
came
at
once
into
the
at
last
appeared
the
countess
herself
the
walking
mummy
sank
into
a
large
voltaire
hermann
looked
through
the
crack
in
the
door
he
saw
lisaveta
pass
close
to
him
and
heard
her
hurried
step
as
she
went
up
the
little
winding
staircase
for
a
moment
he
felt
something
like
remorse
but
it
soon
passed
off
and
his
heart
was
once
more
of
stone
illustration
a
strange
man
had
appeared
the
countess
began
to
undress
before
a
her
of
roses
was
taken
off
and
her
powdered
wig
separated
from
her
own
hair
which
was
very
short
and
quite
white
pins
fell
in
showers
around
her
at
last
she
was
in
her
and
night
cap
and
in
this
costume
more
suitable
to
her
age
was
less
hideous
than
before
like
most
old
people
the
countess
was
tormented
by
sleeplessness
she
had
her
armchair
rolled
towards
one
of
the
windows
and
told
her
maids
to
leave
her
the
lights
were
put
out
and
the
room
was
lighted
only
by
the
lamp
which
burned
before
the
holy
images
the
countess
sallow
and
wrinkled
balanced
herself
gently
from
right
to
left
in
her
dull
eyes
could
be
read
an
utter
absence
of
thought
and
as
she
moved
from
side
to
side
one
might
have
said
that
she
did
so
not
by
any
action
of
the
will
but
through
some
secret
mechanism
suddenly
this
assumed
a
new
expression
the
lips
ceased
to
tremble
and
the
eyes
became
alive
a
strange
man
had
appeared
before
the
countess
it
was
hermann
do
not
be
alarmed
madam
said
hermann
in
a
low
voice
but
very
distinctly
for
the
love
of
heaven
do
not
be
alarmed
i
do
not
wish
to
do
you
the
slightest
harm
on
the
contrary
i
come
to
implore
a
favour
of
you
the
old
woman
looked
at
him
in
silence
as
if
she
did
not
understand
thinking
she
was
deaf
he
leaned
towards
her
ear
and
repeated
what
he
had
said
but
the
countess
still
remained
silent
you
can
ensure
the
happiness
of
my
whole
life
and
without
its
costing
you
a
farthing
i
know
that
you
can
name
to
me
three
cards
the
countess
now
understood
what
he
required
it
was
a
joke
she
interrupted
i
swear
to
you
it
was
only
a
joke
no
madam
replied
hermann
in
an
angry
tone
remember
tchaplitzki
and
how
you
enabled
him
to
win
the
countess
was
agitated
for
a
moment
her
features
expressed
strong
emotion
but
they
soon
resumed
their
former
dulness
can
not
you
name
to
me
said
hermann
three
winning
cards
the
countess
remained
silent
why
keep
this
secret
for
your
he
continued
they
are
rich
enough
without
they
do
not
know
the
value
of
money
of
what
profit
would
your
three
cards
be
to
them
they
are
debauchees
the
man
who
can
not
keep
his
inheritance
will
die
in
want
though
he
had
the
science
of
demons
at
his
command
i
am
a
steady
man
i
know
the
value
of
money
your
three
cards
will
not
be
lost
upon
me
come
he
stopped
tremblingly
awaiting
a
reply
the
countess
did
not
utter
a
word
hermann
went
upon
his
knees
if
your
heart
has
ever
known
the
passion
of
love
if
you
can
remember
its
sweet
ecstasies
if
you
pave
ever
been
touched
by
the
cry
of
a
newborn
babe
if
any
human
feeling
has
ever
caused
your
heart
to
beat
i
entreat
you
by
the
love
of
a
husband
a
lover
a
mother
by
all
that
is
sacred
in
life
not
to
reject
my
prayer
tell
me
your
secret
reflect
you
are
old
you
pave
not
long
to
live
remember
that
the
happiness
of
a
man
is
in
your
hands
that
not
only
myself
but
my
children
and
my
grandchildren
will
bless
your
memory
as
a
saint
the
old
countess
answered
not
a
word
hermann
rose
and
drew
a
pistol
from
his
pocket
hag
he
exclaimed
i
will
make
you
speak
at
the
sight
of
the
pistol
the
countess
for
the
second
time
showed
agitation
her
head
shook
violently
she
stretched
out
her
hands
as
if
to
put
the
weapon
aside
then
suddenly
she
fell
back
motionless
come
do
be
childish
said
hermann
i
adjure
you
for
the
last
time
will
you
name
the
three
cards
the
countess
did
not
answer
hermann
saw
that
she
was
dead
chapter
iv
lisaveta
was
sitting
in
her
room
still
in
her
ball
dress
lost
in
the
deepest
meditation
on
her
return
to
the
house
she
had
sent
away
her
maid
and
had
gone
upstairs
to
her
room
trembling
at
the
idea
of
finding
hermann
there
desiring
indeed
to
find
him
one
glance
showed
her
that
he
was
not
there
and
she
gave
thanks
to
providence
that
he
had
missed
the
appointment
she
sat
down
pensively
without
thinking
of
taking
off
her
cloak
and
allowed
to
pass
through
her
memory
all
the
circumstances
of
the
intrigue
which
had
begun
such
a
short
time
back
and
had
already
advanced
so
far
scarcely
three
weeks
had
passed
since
she
had
first
seen
the
young
officer
from
her
window
and
already
she
had
written
to
him
and
he
had
succeeded
in
inducing
her
to
make
an
appointment
she
knew
his
name
and
that
was
all
she
had
received
a
quantity
of
letters
from
him
but
he
had
never
spoken
to
her
she
did
not
know
the
sound
of
his
voice
and
until
that
evening
strangely
enough
she
had
never
heard
him
spoken
of
illustration
one
glance
showed
her
that
he
was
not
there
but
that
very
evening
tomski
fancying
he
had
noticed
that
the
young
princess
pauline
to
whom
he
had
been
paying
assiduous
court
was
flirting
contrary
to
her
custom
with
another
man
had
wished
to
revenge
himself
by
making
a
show
of
indifference
with
this
noble
object
he
had
invited
lisaveta
to
take
part
in
an
interminable
mazurka
but
he
teased
her
immensely
about
her
partiality
for
engineer
officers
and
pretending
all
the
time
to
know
much
more
than
he
really
did
hazarded
purely
in
fun
a
few
guesses
which
were
so
happy
that
lisaveta
thought
her
secret
must
have
been
discovered
but
who
tells
you
all
this
she
said
with
a
smile
a
friend
of
the
very
officer
you
know
a
most
original
man
and
who
is
this
man
that
is
so
original
his
name
is
hermann
she
answered
nothing
but
her
hands
and
feet
seemed
to
be
of
ice
hermann
is
a
hero
of
romance
continued
tomski
he
has
the
profile
of
napoleon
and
the
soul
of
mephistopheles
i
believe
he
has
at
least
three
crimes
on
his
conscience
but
how
pale
you
are
i
have
a
bad
headache
but
what
did
this
hermann
tell
you
is
not
that
his
name
hermann
is
very
much
displeased
with
his
friend
with
the
engineer
officer
who
has
made
your
acquaintance
he
says
that
in
his
place
he
would
behave
very
differently
but
i
am
quite
sure
that
hermann
himself
has
designs
upon
you
at
least
he
seems
to
listen
with
remarkable
interest
to
all
that
his
friend
tells
him
about
you
and
where
has
he
seen
me
perhaps
in
church
perhaps
in
the
street
heaven
knows
where
at
this
moment
three
ladies
came
forward
according
to
the
custom
of
the
mazurka
and
asked
tomski
to
choose
between
forgetfulness
and
regret
the
figures
and
fashions
of
the
mazurka
are
reproduced
in
the
cotillon
of
western
translator
and
the
conversation
which
had
so
painfully
excited
the
curiosity
of
lisaveta
came
to
an
end
the
lady
who
in
virtue
of
the
infidelities
permitted
by
the
mazurka
had
just
been
chosen
by
tom
ski
was
the
princess
pauline
during
the
rapid
evolutions
which
the
figure
obliged
them
to
make
there
was
a
grand
explanation
between
them
until
at
last
he
conducted
her
to
a
chair
and
returned
to
his
partner
but
tomski
could
now
think
no
more
either
of
hermann
or
lisaveta
and
he
tried
in
vain
to
resume
the
conversation
but
the
mazurka
was
coming
to
an
end
and
immediately
afterwards
the
old
countess
rose
to
go
tomski
mysterious
phrases
were
nothing
more
than
the
usual
platitudes
of
the
mazurka
but
they
had
made
a
deep
impression
upon
the
heart
of
the
poor
little
companion
the
portrait
sketched
by
tomski
had
struck
her
as
very
exact
and
with
her
romantic
ideas
she
saw
in
the
rather
ordinary
countenance
of
her
adorer
something
to
fear
and
admire
she
was
now
sitting
down
with
her
cloak
off
with
bare
shoulders
her
head
crowned
with
flowers
falling
forward
from
fatigue
when
suddenly
the
door
opened
and
hermann
entered
she
shuddered
where
were
you
she
said
trembling
all
over
in
the
countess
bedroom
i
have
just
left
her
replied
hermann
she
is
dead
great
heavens
what
are
you
saying
i
am
afraid
he
said
that
i
am
the
cause
of
her
death
lisaveta
looked
at
him
in
consternation
and
remembered
tomski
words
he
has
at
least
three
crimes
on
his
conscience
hermann
sat
down
by
the
window
and
told
everything
the
young
girl
listened
with
terror
so
those
letters
so
full
of
passion
those
burning
expressions
this
daring
obstinate
pursuit
all
this
had
been
inspired
by
anything
but
love
money
alone
had
inflamed
the
man
soul
she
who
had
nothing
but
a
heart
to
offer
how
could
she
make
him
happy
poor
child
she
had
been
the
blind
instrument
of
a
robber
of
the
murderer
of
her
old
benefactress
she
wept
bitterly
in
the
agony
of
her
repentance
hermann
watched
her
in
silence
but
neither
the
tears
of
the
unhappy
girl
nor
her
beauty
rendered
more
touching
by
her
grief
could
move
his
heart
of
iron
he
had
no
remorse
in
thinking
of
the
countess
death
one
sole
thought
distressed
him
the
irreparable
loss
of
the
secret
which
was
to
have
made
his
fortune
you
are
a
monster
said
lisaveta
after
a
long
silence
i
did
not
mean
to
kill
her
replied
hermann
coldly
my
pistol
was
not
loaded
they
remained
for
some
time
without
speaking
without
looking
at
one
another
the
day
was
breaking
and
lisaveta
put
out
her
candle
she
wiped
her
eyes
drowned
in
tears
and
raised
them
towards
hermann
he
was
standing
close
to
the
window
his
arms
crossed
with
a
frown
on
his
forehead
in
this
attitude
he
reminded
her
involuntarily
of
the
portrait
of
napoleon
the
resemblance
overwhelmed
her
how
am
i
to
get
you
away
she
said
at
last
i
thought
you
might
go
out
by
the
back
stairs
but
it
would
be
necessary
to
go
through
the
countess
bedroom
and
i
am
too
frightened
tell
me
how
to
get
to
the
staircase
and
i
will
go
alone
she
went
to
a
drawer
took
out
a
key
which
she
handed
to
hermann
and
gave
him
the
necessary
instructions
hermann
took
her
icy
hand
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
and
departed
he
went
down
the
staircase
and
entered
the
countess
bedroom
she
was
seated
quite
stiff
in
her
armchair
but
her
features
were
in
no
way
contracted
he
stopped
for
a
moment
and
gazed
into
her
face
as
if
to
make
sure
of
the
terrible
reality
then
he
entered
the
dark
room
and
feeling
behind
the
tapestry
found
the
little
door
which
opened
on
to
a
staircase
as
he
went
down
it
strange
ideas
came
into
his
head
going
down
this
staircase
he
said
to
himself
some
sixty
years
ago
at
about
this
time
may
have
been
seen
some
man
in
an
embroidered
coat
with
powdered
wig
pressing
to
his
breast
a
cocked
hat
some
gallant
who
has
long
been
buried
and
now
the
heart
of
his
aged
mistress
has
ceased
to
beat
at
the
end
of
the
staircase
he
found
another
door
which
his
key
opened
and
he
found
himself
in
the
corridor
which
led
to
the
street
chapter
three
days
after
this
fatal
night
at
nine
in
the
morning
hermann
entered
the
convent
where
the
last
respects
were
to
be
paid
to
the
mortal
remains
of
the
old
countess
he
felt
no
remorse
though
he
could
not
deny
to
himself
that
he
was
the
poor
woman
assassin
having
no
religion
he
was
as
usual
in
such
cases
very
superstitious
believing
that
the
dead
countess
might
exercise
a
malignant
influence
on
his
life
he
thought
to
appease
her
spirit
by
attending
her
funeral
the
church
was
full
of
people
and
it
was
difficult
to
get
in
the
body
had
been
placed
on
a
rich
catafalque
beneath
a
canopy
of
velvet
the
countess
was
reposing
in
an
open
coffin
her
hands
joined
on
her
breast
with
a
dress
of
white
satin
and
of
lace
around
the
catafalque
the
family
was
assembled
the
servants
in
black
caftans
with
a
knot
of
ribbons
on
the
shoulder
exhibiting
the
colours
of
the
countesses
coat
of
arms
each
of
them
held
a
wax
candle
in
his
hand
the
relations
in
deep
mourning
children
grandchildren
and
were
all
present
but
none
of
them
wept
to
have
shed
tears
would
have
looked
like
affectation
the
countess
was
so
old
that
her
death
could
have
taken
no
one
by
surprise
and
she
had
long
been
looked
upon
as
already
out
of
the
world
the
funeral
sermon
was
delivered
by
a
celebrated
preacher
in
a
few
simple
touching
phrases
he
painted
the
final
departure
of
the
just
who
had
passed
long
years
of
contrite
preparation
for
a
christian
end
the
service
concluded
in
the
midst
of
respectful
silence
then
the
relations
went
towards
the
defunct
to
take
a
last
farewell
after
them
in
a
long
procession
all
who
had
been
invited
to
the
ceremony
bowed
for
the
last
time
to
her
who
for
so
many
years
had
been
a
scarecrow
at
their
entertainments
finally
came
the
countess
household
among
them
was
remarked
an
old
governess
of
the
same
age
as
the
deceased
supported
by
two
woman
she
had
not
strength
enough
to
kneel
down
but
tears
flowed
from
her
eyes
as
she
kissed
the
hand
of
her
old
mistress
in
his
turn
hermann
advanced
towards
the
coffin
he
knelt
down
for
a
moment
on
the
flagstones
which
were
strewed
with
branches
of
yew
then
he
rose
as
pale
as
death
and
walked
up
the
steps
of
the
catafalque
he
bowed
his
head
but
suddenly
the
dead
woman
seemed
to
be
staring
at
him
and
with
a
mocking
look
she
opened
and
shut
one
eye
hermann
by
a
sudden
movement
started
and
fell
backwards
several
persons
hurried
towards
him
at
the
same
moment
close
to
the
church
door
lisaveta
fainted
throughout
the
day
hermann
suffered
from
a
strange
indisposition
in
a
quiet
restaurant
where
he
took
his
meals
he
contrary
to
his
habit
drank
a
great
deal
of
wine
with
the
object
of
stupefying
himself
but
the
wine
had
no
effect
but
to
excite
his
imagination
and
give
fresh
activity
to
the
ideas
with
which
he
was
preoccupied
he
went
home
earlier
than
usual
lay
down
with
his
clothes
on
upon
the
bed
and
fell
into
a
leaden
sleep
when
he
woke
up
it
was
night
and
the
room
was
lighted
up
by
the
rays
of
the
moon
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
a
quarter
to
three
he
could
sleep
no
more
he
sat
up
on
the
bed
and
thought
of
the
old
countess
at
this
moment
someone
in
the
street
passed
the
window
looked
into
the
room
and
then
went
on
hermann
scarcely
noticed
it
but
in
another
minute
he
heard
the
door
of
the
open
he
thought
that
his
orderly
drunk
as
usual
was
returning
from
some
nocturnal
excursion
but
the
step
was
one
to
which
he
was
not
accustomed
somebody
seemed
to
be
softly
walking
over
the
floor
in
slippers
illustration
hermann
started
and
fell
backwards
the
door
opened
and
a
woman
dressed
entirely
in
white
entered
the
bedroom
hermann
thought
it
must
be
his
old
nurse
and
he
asked
himself
what
she
could
want
at
that
time
of
night
but
the
woman
in
white
crossing
the
room
with
a
rapid
step
was
now
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
and
hermann
recognised
the
countess
i
come
to
you
against
my
wish
she
said
in
a
firm
voice
i
am
forced
to
grant
your
prayer
three
seven
ace
will
win
if
played
one
after
the
other
but
you
must
not
play
more
than
one
card
in
hours
and
afterwards
as
long
as
you
live
you
must
never
touch
a
card
again
i
forgive
you
my
death
on
condition
of
your
marrying
my
companion
lisaveta
ivanovna
with
these
words
she
walked
towards
the
door
and
gliding
with
her
slippers
over
the
floor
disappeared
hermann
heard
the
door
of
the
open
and
soon
afterwards
saw
a
white
figure
pass
along
the
street
it
stopped
for
a
moment
before
his
window
as
if
to
look
at
him
hermann
remained
for
some
time
astounded
then
he
got
up
and
went
into
the
next
room
his
orderly
drunk
as
usual
was
asleep
on
the
floor
he
had
much
difficulty
in
waking
him
and
then
could
not
obtain
from
him
the
least
explanation
the
door
of
the
was
locked
hermann
went
back
to
his
bedroom
and
wrote
down
all
the
details
of
his
vision
chapter
vi
two
fixed
ideas
can
no
more
exist
together
in
the
moral
world
than
in
the
physical
two
bodies
can
occupy
the
same
place
at
the
same
time
and
three
seven
ace
soon
drove
away
hermann
recollection
of
the
old
countess
last
moments
three
seven
ace
were
now
in
his
head
to
the
exclusion
of
everything
else
they
followed
him
in
his
dreams
and
appeared
to
him
under
strange
forms
threes
seemed
to
be
spread
before
him
like
magnolias
sevens
took
the
form
of
gothic
doors
and
aces
became
gigantic
spiders
his
thoughts
concentrated
themselves
on
one
single
point
how
was
he
to
profit
by
the
secret
so
dearly
purchased
what
if
he
applied
for
leave
to
travel
at
paris
he
said
to
himself
he
would
find
some
where
with
his
three
cards
he
could
at
once
make
his
fortune
chance
soon
came
to
his
assistance
there
was
at
moscow
a
society
of
rich
gamblers
presided
over
by
the
celebrated
tchekalinski
who
had
passed
all
his
life
playing
at
cards
and
had
amassed
millions
for
while
he
lost
silver
only
he
gained
his
magnificent
house
his
excellent
kitchen
his
cordial
manners
had
brought
him
numerous
friends
and
secured
for
him
general
esteem
when
he
came
to
petersburg
the
young
men
of
the
capital
filled
his
rooms
forsaking
balls
for
his
and
preferring
the
emotions
of
gambling
to
the
fascinations
of
flirting
hermann
was
taken
to
tchekalinski
by
narumoff
they
passed
through
a
long
suite
of
rooms
full
of
the
most
attentive
obsequious
servants
the
place
was
crowded
generals
and
high
officials
were
playing
at
whist
young
men
were
stretched
out
on
the
sofas
eating
ices
and
smoking
long
pipes
in
the
principal
room
at
the
head
of
a
long
table
around
which
were
assembled
a
score
of
players
the
master
of
the
house
held
a
faro
bank
he
was
a
man
of
about
sixty
with
a
sweet
and
noble
expression
of
face
and
hair
white
as
snow
on
his
full
florid
countenance
might
be
read
good
humour
and
benevolence
his
eyes
shone
with
a
perpetual
smile
narumoff
introduced
hermann
tchekalinski
took
him
by
the
hand
told
him
that
he
was
glad
to
see
him
that
no
one
stood
on
ceremony
in
his
house
and
then
went
on
dealing
the
deal
occupied
some
time
and
stakes
were
made
on
more
than
thirty
cards
tchekalinski
waited
patiently
to
allow
the
winners
time
to
double
their
stakes
paid
what
he
had
lost
listened
politely
to
all
observations
and
more
politely
still
put
straight
the
corners
of
cards
when
in
a
fit
of
absence
some
one
had
taken
the
liberty
of
turning
them
down
at
last
when
the
game
was
at
an
end
tchekalinski
collected
the
cards
shuffled
them
again
had
them
cut
and
then
dealt
anew
will
you
allow
me
to
take
a
card
said
hermann
stretching
out
his
arm
above
a
fat
man
who
occupied
nearly
the
whole
of
one
side
of
the
table
tchekalinski
with
a
gracious
smile
bowed
in
consent
naroumoff
complimented
hermann
with
a
laugh
on
the
cessation
of
the
austerity
by
which
his
conduct
had
hitherto
been
marked
and
wished
him
all
kinds
of
happiness
on
the
occasion
of
his
first
appearance
in
the
character
of
a
gambler
there
said
hermann
after
writing
some
figures
on
the
back
of
his
card
how
much
asked
the
banker
half
closing
his
eyes
excuse
me
i
can
not
see
thousand
rubles
said
hermann
everyone
eyes
were
directed
toward
the
new
player
he
has
lost
his
head
thought
harumoff
allow
me
to
point
out
to
you
said
tchekalinski
with
his
eternal
smile
that
you
are
playing
rather
high
we
never
put
down
here
as
a
first
stake
more
than
a
hundred
and
rubles
very
well
said
hermann
but
do
you
accept
my
stake
or
not
tchekalinski
bowed
in
token
of
acceptation
i
only
wish
to
point
out
to
you
he
said
that
although
i
am
perfectly
sure
of
my
friends
i
can
only
play
against
ready
money
i
am
quite
convinced
that
your
word
is
as
good
as
gold
but
to
keep
up
the
rules
of
the
game
and
to
facilitate
calculations
i
should
be
obliged
to
you
if
you
would
put
the
money
on
your
card
hermann
took
a
from
his
pocket
and
handed
it
to
tchekalinski
who
after
examining
it
with
a
glance
placed
it
on
hermann
card
then
he
began
to
deal
he
turned
up
on
the
right
a
ten
and
on
the
left
a
three
i
win
said
hermann
exhibiting
his
three
a
murmur
of
astonishment
ran
through
the
assembly
the
banker
knitted
his
eyebrows
but
speedily
his
face
resumed
its
everlasting
smile
shall
i
settle
at
once
he
asked
if
you
will
be
kind
enough
to
do
so
said
hermann
tchekalinski
took
a
bundle
of
from
his
and
paid
hermann
pocketed
his
winnings
and
left
the
table
narumoff
was
lost
in
astonishment
hermann
drank
a
glass
of
lemonade
and
went
home
the
next
evening
he
returned
to
the
house
tchekalinski
again
held
the
bank
hermann
went
to
the
table
and
this
time
the
players
hastened
to
make
room
for
him
tchekalinski
received
him
with
a
most
gracious
bow
hermann
waited
took
a
card
and
staked
on
it
his
thousand
roubles
together
with
the
like
sum
which
he
had
gained
the
evening
before
tchekalinski
began
to
deal
he
turned
up
on
the
right
a
knave
and
on
the
left
a
seven
hermann
exhibited
a
seven
there
was
a
general
exclamation
tchekalinski
was
evidently
ill
at
ease
but
he
counted
out
the
thousand
roubles
to
hermann
who
took
them
in
the
calmest
manner
rose
from
the
table
and
went
away
illustration
he
saw
before
him
a
queen
of
spades
the
next
evening
at
the
accustomed
hour
he
again
appeared
everyone
was
expecting
him
generals
and
high
officials
had
left
their
whist
to
watch
this
extraordinary
play
the
young
officers
had
quitted
their
sofas
and
even
the
servants
of
the
house
pressed
round
the
table
when
hermann
took
his
seat
the
other
players
ceased
to
stake
so
impatient
were
they
to
see
him
have
it
out
with
the
banker
who
still
smiling
watched
the
approach
of
his
antagonist
and
prepared
to
meet
him
each
of
them
untied
at
the
same
time
a
pack
of
cards
tchekalinski
shuffled
and
hermann
cut
then
the
latter
took
up
a
card
and
covered
it
with
a
heap
of
banknotes
it
was
like
the
preliminaries
of
a
duel
a
deep
silence
reigned
through
the
room
tchekalinski
took
up
the
cards
with
trembling
hands
and
dealt
on
one
side
he
put
down
a
queen
and
on
the
other
side
an
ace
ace
wins
said
hermann
no
queen
loses
said
tchekalinski
hermann
looked
instead
of
ace
he
saw
a
queen
of
spades
before
him
he
could
not
trust
his
eyes
and
now
as
he
gazed
in
fascination
on
the
fatal
card
he
fancied
that
he
saw
the
queen
of
spades
open
and
then
close
her
eye
while
at
the
same
time
she
gave
a
mocking
smile
he
felt
a
thrill
of
nameless
horror
the
queen
of
spades
resembled
the
dead
countess
hermann
is
now
at
the
obukhoff
asylum
room
no
a
hopeless
madman
he
answers
no
questions
which
we
put
to
him

he
mumbles
to
himself

cessation

there
was
only
one
man
among
us
who
did
not
belong
to
the
regiment
he
was
about
and
of
course
we
looked
upon
him
as
an
old
fellow
he
had
the
advantage
of
experience
and
his
habitual
gloom
stern
features
and
his
sharp
tongue
gave
him
great
influence
over
his
juniors
he
was
surrounded
by
a
certain
mystery
his
looks
were
russian
but
his
name
was
foreign
he
had
served
in
the
hussars
and
with
credit
no
one
knew
what
had
induced
him
to
retire
and
settle
in
this
out
of
the
way
little
village
where
he
lived
in
mingled
poverty
and
extravagance
he
always
went
on
foot
and
wore
a
shabby
black
coat
but
he
was
always
ready
to
receive
any
of
our
officers

though
his
dinners
cooked
by
a
retired
soldier
never
consisted
of
more
than
two

champagne
flowed
at
them
like

his
income
or
how
he
got
it
no
one
knew
and
no
one
ventured
to
ask
he
had
a
few
books
on
military
subjects
and
a
few
novels
which
he
willingly
lent
and
never
asked
to
have
returned
but
on
the
other
hand
he
never
returned
the
books
he
himself
borrowed
his
principal
recreation
was
the
walls
of
his
room
were
riddled
with
perfect
honeycomb
a
rich
collection
of
pistols
was
the
only
thing
luxurious
in

his
skill
as

was
quite
prodigious
if

will
call
him
never
joined
in
it
when
asked
if
he
had
ever
fought
he
answered
curtly
yes
but
he
gave
no
particulars
and
it
was
evident
that
he
disliked
such
questions
we
concluded
that
the
memory
of
some
unhappy
victim
of
his
terrible
skill
preyed
heavily
upon
his
conscience
none
of
us
could
ever
have
suspected
him
of
cowardice
there
are
men
whose
look
alone
is
enough
to
repel
such
a
suspicion
an
unexpected
incident
fairly
astonished
us
one
afternoon
about
ten
officers
were
dining
with
silvio
they
drank
as
usual
that
is
to
say
a
great
deal
after
dinner
we
asked
our
host
to
make
a
pool
for
a
long
time
he
refused
on
the
ground
that
he
seldom
played
at
last
he
ordered
cards
to
be
brought
in
with
half
a
hundred
gold
pieces
on
the
table
we
sat
round
him
and
the
game
began
it
was
silvio
habit
not
to
speak
when
playing
he
never
disputed
or
explained
if
an
adversary
made
a
mistake
silvio
without
a
word
chalked
it
down
against
him
knowing
his
way
we
always
let
him
have
it
but
among
us
on
this
occasion
was
an
officer
who
had
but
lately
joined
while
playing
he
scored
a
point
too
much
silvio
took
the
chalk
and
corrected
the
score
in
his
own
fashion
the
officer
supposing
him
to
have
made
a
mistake
began
to
explain
silvio
went
on
dealing
in
silence
the
officer
losing
patience
took
the
brush
and
rubbed
out
what
he
thought
was
wrong
silvio
took
the
chalk
and
recorrected
it
the
officer
heated
with
wine
and
play
and
irritated
by
the
laughter
of
the
company
thought
himself
aggrieved
and
in
a
fit
of
passion
seized
a
brass
candlestick
and
threw
it
at
silvio
who
only
just
managed
to
avoid
the
missile
great
was
our
confusion
silvio
got
up
white
with
rage
and
said
with
sparkling
eyes
sir
have
the
goodness
to
withdraw
and
you
may
thank
god
that
this
has
happened
in
my
own
house
we
could
have
no
doubt
as
to
the
consequences
and
we
already
looked
upon
our
new
comrade
as
a
dead
man
he
withdrew
saying
that
he
was
ready
to
give
satisfaction
for
his
offence
in
any
way
desired
the
game
went
on
for
a
few
minutes
but
feeling
that
our
host
was
upset
we
gradually
left
off
playing
and
dispersed
each
to
his
own
quarters
at
the
riding
school
next
day
we
were
already
asking
one
another
whether
the
young
lieutenant
was
still
alive
when
he
appeared
among
us
we
asked
him
the
same
question
and
were
told
that
he
had
not
yet
heard
from
silvio
we
were
astonished
we
went
to
silvio
and
found
him
in
the
popping
bullet
after
bullet
into
an
ace
which
he
had
gummed
to
the
gate
he
received
us
as
usual
but
made
no
allusion
to
what
had
happened
on
the
previous
evening
three
days
passed
and
the
lieutenant
was
still
alive
can
it
be
possible
we
asked
one
another
in
astonishment
that
silvio
will
not
fight
silvio
did
not
fight
he
accepted
a
flimsy
apology
and
became
reconciled
to
the
man
who
had
insulted
him
this
lowered
him
greatly
in
the
opinion
of
the
young
men
who
placing
bravery
above
all
the
other
human
virtues
and
regarding
it
as
an
excuse
for
every
imaginable
vice
were
ready
to
overlook
anything
sooner
than
a
lack
of
courage
however
little
by
little
all
was
forgotten
and
silvio
regained
his
former
influence
i
alone
could
not
renew
my
friendship
with
him
being
naturally
romantic
i
had
surpassed
the
rest
in
my
attachment
to
the
man
whose
life
was
an
enigma
and
who
seemed
to
me
a
hero
of
some
mysterious
story
he
liked
me
and
with
me
alone
did
he
drop
his
sarcastic
tone
and
converse
simply
and
most
agreeably
on
many
subjects
but
after
this
unlucky
evening
the
thought
that
his
honour
was
tarnished
and
that
it
remained
so
by
his
own
choice
never
left
me
and
this
prevented
any
renewal
of
our
former
intimacy
i
was
ashamed
to
look
at
him
silvio
was
too
sharp
and
experienced
not
to
notice
this
and
guess
the
reason
it
seemed
to
vex
him
for
i
observed
that
once
or
twice
he
hinted
at
an
explanation
but
i
wanted
none
and
silvio
gave
me
up
thenceforth
i
only
met
him
in
the
presence
of
other
friends
and
our
confidential
talks
were
at
an
end
the
busy
occupants
of
the
capital
have
no
idea
of
the
emotions
so
frequently
experienced
by
residents
in
the
country
and
in
country
towns
as
for
instance
in
awaiting
the
arrival
of
the
post
on
tuesdays
and
fridays
the
bureau
of
the
regimental
staff
was
crammed
with
officers
some
were
expecting
money
others
letters
or
newspapers
the
letters
were
mostly
opened
on
the
spot
and
the
news
freely
interchanged
the
office
meanwhile
presenting
a
most
lively
appearance
silvio
letters
used
to
be
addressed
to
our
regiment
and
he
usually
called
for
them
himself
on
one
occasion
a
letter
having
been
handed
to
him
i
saw
him
break
the
seal
and
with
a
look
of
great
impatience
read
the
contents
his
eyes
sparkled
the
other
officers
each
engaged
with
his
own
letters
did
not
notice
anything
gentlemen
said
silvio
circumstances
demand
my
immediate
departure
i
leave
tonight
and
i
hope
you
will
not
refuse
to
dine
with
me
for
the
last
time
i
shall
expect
you
too
he
added
turning
towards
me
without
fail
with
these
words
he
hurriedly
left
and
we
agreed
to
meet
at
silvio
i
went
to
silvio
at
the
appointed
time
and
found
nearly
the
whole
regiment
with
him
his
things
were
already
packed
nothing
remained
but
the
bare
walls
we
sat
down
to
table
the
host
was
in
excellent
spirits
and
his
liveliness
communicated
itself
to
the
rest
of
the
company
corks
popped
every
moment
bottles
fizzed
and
tumblers
foamed
incessantly
and
we
with
much
warmth
wished
our
departing
friend
a
pleasant
journey
and
every
happiness
the
evening
was
far
advanced
when
we
rose
from
table
during
the
search
for
hats
silvio
wished
everybody
goodbye
then
taking
me
by
the
hand
as
i
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
he
said
in
a
low
voice
i
want
to
speak
to
you
i
stopped
behind
the
guests
had
gone
and
we
were
left
alone
sitting
down
opposite
one
another
we
lighted
our
pipes
silvio
was
much
agitated
no
traces
of
his
former
gaiety
remained
deadly
pale
with
sparkling
eyes
and
a
thick
smoke
issuing
from
his
mouth
he
looked
like
a
demon
several
minutes
passed
before
he
broke
silence
perhaps
we
shall
never
meet
again
he
said
before
saying
goodbye
i
want
to
have
a
few
words
with
you
you
may
have
remarked
that
i
care
little
for
the
opinion
of
others
but
i
like
you
and
should
be
sorry
to
leave
you
under
a
wrong
impression
he
paused
and
began
refilling
his
pipe
i
looked
down
and
was
silent
you
thought
it
odd
he
continued
that
i
did
not
require
satisfaction
from
that
drunken
maniac
you
will
grant
however
that
being
entitled
to
the
choice
of
weapons
i
had
his
life
more
or
less
in
my
hands
i
might
attribute
my
tolerance
to
generosity
but
i
will
not
deceive
you
if
i
could
have
chastised
him
without
the
least
risk
to
myself
without
the
slightest
danger
to
my
own
life
then
i
would
on
no
account
have
forgiven
him
illustration
here
is
a
memento
of
our
duel
i
looked
at
silvio
with
surprise
such
a
confession
completely
upset
me
silvio
continued
precisely
so
i
had
no
right
to
endanger
my
life
six
years
ago
i
received
a
slap
in
the
face
and
my
enemy
still
lives
my
curiosity
was
greatly
excited
did
you
not
fight
him
i
inquired
circumstances
probably
separated
you
i
did
fight
him
replied
silvio
and
here
is
a
memento
of
our
duel
he
rose
and
took
from
a
cardboard
box
a
red
cap
with
a
gold
tassel
and
gold
braid
my
disposition
is
well
known
to
you
i
have
been
accustomed
to
be
first
in
everything
prom
my
youth
this
has
been
my
passion
in
my
time
dissipation
was
the
fashion
and
i
was
the
most
dissipated
man
in
the
army
we
used
to
boast
of
our
drunkenness
i
beat
at
drinking
the
celebrated
burtsoff
of
whom
davidoff
has
sung
in
his
poems
duels
in
our
regiment
were
of
daily
occurrence
i
took
part
in
all
of
them
either
as
second
or
as
principal
my
comrades
adored
me
while
the
commanders
of
the
regiment
who
were
constantly
being
changed
looked
upon
me
as
an
incurable
evil
i
was
calmly
or
rather
boisterously
enjoying
my
reputation
when
a
certain
young
man
joined
our
regiment
he
was
rich
and
came
of
a
distinguished
family
i
will
not
name
him
never
in
my
life
did
i
meet
with
so
brilliant
so
fortunate
a
fellow
young
clever
handsome
with
the
wildest
spirits
the
most
reckless
bravery
bearing
a
celebrated
name
possessing
funds
of
which
he
did
not
know
the
amount
but
which
were
inexhaustible
you
may
imagine
the
effect
he
was
sure
to
produce
among
us
my
leadership
was
shaken
dazzled
by
my
reputation
he
began
by
seeking
my
friendship
but
i
received
him
coldly
at
which
without
the
least
sign
of
regret
he
kept
aloof
from
me
illustration
we
clutched
our
swords
i
took
a
dislike
to
him
his
success
in
the
regiment
and
in
the
society
of
women
brought
me
to
despair
i
tried
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
him
to
my
epigrams
he
replied
with
epigrams
which
always
seemed
to
me
more
pointed
and
more
piercing
than
my
own
and
which
were
certainly
much
livelier
for
while
he
joked
i
was
raving
finally
at
a
ball
at
the
house
of
a
polish
landed
proprietor
seeing
him
receive
marked
attention
from
all
the
ladies
and
especially
from
the
lady
of
the
house
who
had
formerly
been
on
very
friendly
terms
with
me
i
whispered
some
low
insult
in
his
ear
he
flew
into
a
passion
and
gave
me
a
slap
on
the
cheek
we
clutched
our
swords
the
ladies
fainted
we
were
separated
and
the
same
night
we
drove
out
to
fight
it
was
nearly
daybreak
i
was
standing
at
the
appointed
spot
with
my
three
seconds
how
impatiently
i
awaited
my
opponent
the
spring
sun
had
risen
and
it
was
growing
hot
at
last
i
saw
him
in
the
distance
he
was
on
foot
accompanied
by
only
one
second
we
advanced
to
meet
him
he
approached
holding
in
his
hand
his
regimental
cap
filled
full
of
black
cherries
the
seconds
measured
twelve
paces
it
was
for
me
to
fire
first
but
my
excitement
was
so
great
that
i
could
not
depend
upon
the
certainty
of
my
hand
and
in
order
to
give
myself
time
to
get
calm
i
ceded
the
first
shot
to
my
adversary
he
would
not
accept
it
and
we
decided
to
cast
lots
the
number
fell
to
him
constant
favourite
of
fortune
that
he
was
he
aimed
and
put
a
bullet
through
my
cap
it
was
now
my
turn
his
life
at
last
was
in
my
hands
i
looked
at
him
eagerly
trying
to
detect
if
only
some
faint
shadow
of
uneasiness
but
he
stood
beneath
my
pistol
picking
out
ripe
cherries
from
his
cap
and
spitting
out
the
stones
some
of
which
fell
near
me
his
indifference
enraged
me
is
the
use
thought
i
depriving
him
of
life
when
he
sets
no
value
upon
it
as
this
savage
thought
flitted
through
my
brain
i
lowered
the
pistol
do
seem
to
be
ready
for
death
i
said
are
eating
your
breakfast
and
i
do
want
to
interfere
with
you
do
interfere
with
me
in
the
least
he
replied
good
enough
to
fire
or
do
fire
if
you
prefer
it
the
shot
remains
with
you
and
i
shall
be
at
your
service
at
any
moment
i
turned
to
the
seconds
informing
them
that
i
had
no
intention
of
firing
that
day
and
with
this
the
duel
ended
i
resigned
my
commission
and
retired
to
this
little
place
since
then
not
a
single
day
has
passed
that
i
have
not
thought
of
my
revenge
and
now
the
hour
has
arrived
illustration
his
life
at
last
was
in
my
hands
silvio
took
from
his
pocket
the
letter
he
had
received
that
morning
and
handed
it
to
me
to
read
someone
it
seemed
to
be
his
business
agent
wrote
to
him
from
moscow
that
a
certain
individual
was
soon
to
be
married
to
a
young
and
beautiful
girl
you
guess
said
silvio
who
the
certain
individual
is
i
am
starting
for
moscow
me
shall
see
whether
he
will
be
as
indifferent
now
as
he
was
some
time
ago
when
in
presence
of
death
he
ate
cherries
with
these
words
silvio
rose
threw
his
cap
upon
the
floor
and
began
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
like
a
tiger
in
his
cage
i
remained
silent
strange
contending
feelings
agitated
me
the
servant
entered
and
announced
that
the
horses
were
ready
silvio
grasped
my
hand
tightly
he
got
into
the
in
which
lay
two
trunks
one
containing
his
pistols
the
other
some
personal
effects
we
wished
a
second
time
and
the
horses
galloped
off
chapter
ii
many
years
passed
and
family
circumstances
obliged
me
to
settle
in
the
poor
little
village
of
engaged
in
farming
i
sighed
in
secret
for
my
former
merry
careless
existence
most
difficult
of
all
i
found
it
to
pass
in
solitude
the
spring
and
winter
evenings
until
the
dinner
hour
i
somehow
occupied
the
time
talking
to
the
driving
round
to
see
how
the
work
went
on
or
visiting
the
new
buildings
but
as
soon
as
evening
began
to
draw
in
i
was
at
a
loss
what
to
do
with
myself
my
books
in
various
bookcases
cupboards
and
storerooms
i
knew
by
heart
the
housekeeper
kurilovna
related
to
me
all
the
stories
she
could
remember
the
songs
of
the
peasant
women
made
me
melancholy
i
tried
cherry
brandy
but
that
gave
me
the
headache
i
must
confess
however
that
i
had
some
fear
of
becoming
a
drunkard
from
the
saddest
kind
of
drunkenness
imaginable
of
which
i
had
seen
many
examples
in
our
district
i
had
no
near
neighbours
with
the
exception
of
two
or
three
melancholy
ones
whose
conversation
consisted
mostly
of
hiccups
and
sighs
solitude
was
preferable
to
that
finally
i
decided
to
go
to
bed
as
early
as
possible
and
to
dine
as
late
as
possible
thus
shortening
the
evening
and
lengthening
the
day
and
i
found
this
plan
a
good
one
pour
versts
from
my
place
was
a
large
estate
belonging
to
count
but
the
steward
alone
lived
there
the
countess
had
visited
her
domain
once
only
just
after
her
marriage
and
she
then
only
lived
there
about
a
month
however
in
the
second
spring
of
my
retirement
there
was
a
report
that
the
countess
with
her
husband
would
come
to
spend
the
summer
on
her
estate
and
they
arrived
at
the
beginning
of
june
the
advent
of
a
rich
neighbour
is
an
important
event
for
residents
in
the
country
the
landowners
and
the
people
of
their
household
talk
of
it
for
a
couple
of
months
beforehand
and
for
three
years
afterwards
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
i
must
confess
the
expected
arrival
of
a
young
and
beautiful
neighbour
affected
me
strongly
i
burned
with
impatience
to
see
her
and
the
first
sunday
after
her
arrival
i
started
for
the
village
in
order
to
present
myself
to
the
count
and
countess
as
their
near
neighbour
and
humble
servant
the
footman
showed
me
into
the
count
study
while
he
went
to
inform
him
of
my
arrival
the
spacious
room
was
furnished
in
a
most
luxurious
manner
against
the
walls
stood
enclosed
bookshelves
well
furnished
with
books
and
surmounted
by
bronze
busts
over
the
marble
mantelpiece
was
a
large
mirror
the
floor
was
covered
with
green
cloth
over
which
were
spread
rugs
and
carpets
having
got
unaccustomed
to
luxury
in
my
own
poor
little
corner
and
not
having
beheld
the
wealth
of
other
people
for
a
long
while
i
was
awed
and
i
awaited
the
count
with
a
sort
of
fear
just
as
a
petitioner
from
the
provinces
awaits
in
an
the
arrival
of
the
minister
the
doors
opened
and
a
man
about
and
very
handsome
entered
the
apartment
the
count
approached
me
with
a
frank
and
friendly
look
i
tried
to
be
and
began
to
introduce
myself
but
he
forestalled
me
we
sat
down
his
easy
and
agreeable
conversation
soon
dissipated
my
nervous
timidity
i
was
already
passing
into
my
usual
manner
when
suddenly
the
countess
entered
and
i
became
more
confused
than
ever
she
was
indeed
beautiful
the
count
presented
me
i
was
anxious
to
appear
at
ease
but
the
more
i
tried
to
assume
an
air
of
unrestraint
the
more
awkward
i
felt
myself
becoming
they
in
order
to
give
me
time
to
recover
myself
and
get
accustomed
to
my
new
acquaintances
conversed
with
one
another
treating
me
in
good
neighbourly
fashion
without
ceremony
meanwhile
i
walked
about
the
room
examining
the
books
and
pictures
in
pictures
i
am
no
but
one
of
the
attracted
my
particular
notice
it
represented
a
view
in
switzerland
was
not
however
struck
by
the
painting
but
by
the
fact
that
it
was
shot
through
by
two
bullets
one
planted
just
on
the
top
of
the
other
a
good
shot
i
remarked
turning
to
the
count
yes
he
replied
a
very
remarkable
shot
do
you
shoot
well
he
added
tolerably
i
answered
rejoicing
that
the
conversation
had
turned
at
last
on
a
subject
which
interested
me
at
a
distance
of
thirty
paces
i
do
not
miss
a
card
i
mean
of
course
with
a
pistol
that
i
am
accustomed
to
really
said
the
countess
with
a
look
of
great
interest
you
my
dear
could
you
hit
a
card
at
thirty
paces
some
day
replied
the
count
we
will
try
in
my
own
time
i
did
not
shoot
badly
but
it
is
four
years
now
since
i
held
a
pistol
in
my
hand
oh
i
replied
in
that
case
i
bet
count
that
you
will
not
hit
a
card
even
at
twenty
paces
the
pistol
demands
daily
practice
i
know
that
from
experience
in
our
regiment
i
was
reckoned
one
of
the
bests
shots
once
i
happened
not
to
take
a
pistol
in
hand
for
a
whole
month
i
had
sent
my
own
to
the
gunsmith
well
what
do
you
think
count
the
first
time
i
began
again
to
shoot
i
four
times
running
missed
a
bottle
at
twenty
paces
the
captain
of
our
company
who
was
a
wit
happened
to
be
present
and
he
said
to
me
hand
my
friend
refuses
to
raise
itself
against
the
bottle
no
count
you
must
not
neglect
to
practise
or
you
will
soon
lose
all
skill
the
best
shot
i
ever
knew
used
to
shoot
every
day
and
at
least
three
times
every
day
before
dinner
this
was
as
much
his
habit
as
the
preliminary
glass
of
vodka
illustration
silvio
knew
silvio
the
count
and
countess
seemed
pleased
that
i
had
begun
to
talk
and
what
sort
of
a
shot
was
he
asked
the
count
this
sort
count
if
he
saw
a
fly
settle
on
the
wall
you
smile
countess
but
i
assure
you
it
is
a
fact
when
he
saw
the
fly
he
would
call
out
my
pistol
kuska
brought
him
the
loaded
pistol
a
crack
and
the
fly
was
crushed
into
the
wall
that
is
astonishing
said
the
count
and
what
was
his
name
silvio
was
his
name
silvio
exclaimed
the
count
starting
from
his
seat
knew
silvio
how
could
i
fail
to
know
him
we
were
comrades
he
was
received
at
our
mess
like
a
brother
officer
it
is
now
about
five
years
since
i
last
had
tidings
of
him
then
you
count
also
knew
him
i
knew
him
very
well
did
he
never
tell
you
of
one
very
extraordinary
incident
in
his
life
do
you
mean
the
slap
in
the
face
count
that
he
received
from
a
blackguard
at
a
ball
he
did
not
tell
you
the
name
of
this
blackguard
no
count
he
did
not
forgive
me
i
added
guessing
the
truth
forgive
me
i
did
not
could
it
really
have
been
you
it
was
myself
replied
the
count
greatly
agitated
and
the
shots
in
the
picture
are
a
memento
of
our
last
meeting
oh
my
dear
said
the
countess
for
god
sake
do
not
relate
it
it
frightens
me
to
think
of
it
no
replied
the
count
i
must
tell
him
all
he
knows
how
i
insulted
his
friend
he
shall
also
know
how
silvio
revenged
himself
the
count
pushed
a
chair
towards
me
and
with
the
liveliest
interest
i
listened
to
the
following
story
five
years
ago
began
the
count
i
got
married
the
honeymoon
i
spent
here
in
this
village
to
this
house
i
am
indebted
for
the
happiest
moments
of
my
life
and
for
one
of
its
saddest
remembrances
one
afternoon
we
went
out
riding
together
my
wife
horse
became
restive
she
was
frightened
got
off
the
horse
handed
the
reins
over
to
me
and
walked
home
i
rode
on
before
her
in
the
yard
i
saw
a
travelling
carriage
and
i
was
told
that
in
my
study
sat
a
man
who
would
not
give
his
name
but
simply
said
that
he
wanted
to
see
me
on
business
i
entered
the
study
and
saw
in
the
darkness
a
man
dusty
and
unshaven
he
stood
there
by
the
fireplace
i
approached
him
trying
to
recollect
his
face
do
remember
me
count
he
said
in
a
tremulous
voice
i
cried
and
i
confess
i
felt
that
my
hair
was
standing
on
end
so
he
added
owe
me
a
shot
i
have
come
to
claim
it
are
you
ready
a
pistol
protruded
from
his
side
pocket
i
measured
twelve
paces
and
stood
there
in
that
corner
begging
him
to
fire
quickly
before
my
wife
came
in
he
hesitated
and
asked
for
a
light
candles
were
brought
in
i
locked
the
doors
gave
orders
that
no
one
should
enter
and
again
called
upon
him
to
fire
he
took
out
his
pistol
and
aimed
i
counted
the
seconds
i
thought
of
her
a
terrible
moment
passed
then
silvio
lowered
his
hand
only
regret
he
said
that
the
pistol
is
not
loaded
with
my
bullet
is
heavy
and
it
always
seems
to
me
that
an
affair
of
this
kind
is
net
a
duel
but
a
murder
i
am
not
accustomed
to
aim
at
unarmed
men
let
us
begin
again
from
the
beginning
let
us
cast
lots
as
to
who
shall
fire
first
my
head
went
round
i
think
i
objected
finally
however
we
loaded
another
pistol
and
rolled
up
two
pieces
of
paper
these
he
placed
inside
his
cap
the
one
through
which
at
our
first
meeting
i
had
put
the
bullet
i
again
drew
the
lucky
number
you
have
the
devil
luck
he
said
with
a
smile
which
i
shall
never
forget
i
do
know
what
i
was
about
or
how
it
happened
that
he
succeeded
in
inducing
me
but
i
fired
and
hit
that
picture
the
count
pointed
with
his
finger
to
the
picture
with
the
his
face
had
become
red
with
agitation
the
countess
was
whiter
than
her
own
handkerchief
and
i
could
not
restrain
an
exclamation
i
fired
continued
the
count
and
thank
heaven
missed
then
silvio
at
this
moment
he
was
really
terrible
then
silvio
raised
his
pistol
to
take
aim
at
me
suddenly
the
door
flew
open
masha
rushed
into
the
room
she
threw
herself
upon
my
neck
with
a
loud
shriek
her
presence
restored
to
my
courage
dear
i
said
to
her
you
see
that
we
are
only
joking
how
frightened
you
look
go
and
drink
a
glass
of
water
and
then
come
back
i
will
introduce
you
to
an
old
friend
and
comrade
masha
was
still
in
doubt
illustration
masha
threw
herself
at
his
feet
me
is
my
husband
speaking
the
truth
she
asked
turning
to
the
terrible
silvio
it
true
that
you
are
only
joking
is
always
joking
countess
silvio
replied
once
in
a
joke
gave
me
a
slap
in
the
face
in
joke
he
put
a
bullet
through
this
cap
while
i
was
wearing
it
and
in
joke
too
he
missed
me
when
he
fired
just
now
and
now
have
a
fancy
for
a
joke
with
these
words
he
raised
his
pistol
as
if
to
shoot
me
down
before
her
eyes
masha
threw
herself
at
his
feet
masha
for
shame
i
cried
in
my
passion
you
sir
cease
to
amuse
yourself
at
the
expense
of
an
unhappy
woman
will
you
fire
or
not
will
not
replied
silvio
am
satisfied
i
have
witnessed
your
agitation
your
terror
i
forced
you
to
fire
at
me
that
is
enough
you
will
remember
me
i
leave
you
to
your
conscience
he
was
now
about
to
go
but
he
stopped
at
the
door
looked
round
at
the
picture
which
my
shot
had
passed
through
fired
at
it
almost
without
taking
aim
and
disappeared
my
wife
had
sunk
down
fainting
the
servants
had
not
ventured
to
stop
silvio
whom
they
looked
upon
with
terror
he
passed
out
to
the
steps
called
his
coachman
and
before
i
could
collect
myself
drove
off
the
count
was
silent
i
had
now
heard
the
end
of
the
story
of
which
the
beginning
had
long
before
surprised
me
the
hero
of
it
i
never
saw
again
i
heard
however
that
silvio
during
the
rising
of
alexander
ipsilanti
commanded
a
detach
of
insurgents
and
was
killed
in
action
the
snowstorm
towards
the
end
of
at
a
memorable
period
for
russians
lived
on
his
own
domain
of
nenaradova
the
gravril
he
was
celebrated
in
the
whole
district
for
his
hospitality
and
his
genial
character
neighbours
constantly
visited
him
to
have
something
to
eat
and
drink
and
to
play
at
boston
with
his
wife
praskovia
some
too
went
to
have
a
look
at
their
daughter
maria
a
tall
pale
girl
of
seventeen
she
was
an
heiress
and
they
desired
her
either
for
themselves
or
for
their
sons
maria
had
been
brought
up
on
french
novels
and
consequently
was
in
love
the
object
of
her
affection
was
a
poor
ensign
in
the
army
who
was
now
at
home
in
his
small
village
on
leave
of
absence
as
a
matter
of
course
the
young
man
reciprocated
maria
passion
but
the
parents
of
his
beloved
noticing
their
mutual
attachment
forbade
their
daughter
even
to
think
of
him
while
they
received
him
worse
than
an
judge
illustration
the
lovers
met
in
the
pine
wood
our
lovers
corresponded
and
met
alone
daily
in
the
pine
wood
or
by
the
old
roadway
chapel
there
they
vowed
everlasting
love
inveighed
against
fate
and
exchanged
various
suggestions
writing
and
talking
in
this
way
they
quite
naturally
reached
the
following
conclusion
if
we
can
not
exist
apart
from
each
other
and
if
the
tyranny
of
parents
throws
obstacles
in
the
way
of
our
happiness
then
can
we
not
manage
without
them
of
course
this
happy
idea
originated
in
the
mind
of
the
young
man
but
it
pleased
the
romantic
imagination
of
maria
immensely
winter
set
in
and
put
a
stop
to
their
meetings
but
their
correspondence
became
all
the
more
active
vladimir
begged
maria
in
every
letter
to
give
herself
up
to
him
that
they
might
get
married
secretly
hide
for
a
while
and
then
throw
themselves
at
the
feet
of
the
parents
who
would
of
course
in
the
end
be
touched
by
their
heroic
constancy
and
say
to
them
children
come
to
our
arms
maria
hesitated
a
long
while
and
out
of
many
different
plans
proposed
that
of
flight
was
for
a
time
rejected
at
last
however
she
consented
on
the
appointed
day
she
was
to
decline
supper
and
retire
to
her
room
under
the
plea
of
a
headache
she
and
her
maid
who
was
in
the
secret
were
then
to
go
out
into
the
garden
by
the
back
stairs
and
beyond
the
garden
they
would
find
a
sledge
ready
for
them
would
get
into
it
and
drive
a
distance
of
five
miles
from
nenaradova
to
the
village
of
jadrino
straight
to
the
church
where
vladimir
would
be
waiting
for
them
on
the
eve
of
the
decisive
day
maria
did
not
sleep
all
night
she
was
packing
and
tying
up
linen
and
dresses
she
wrote
moreover
a
long
letter
to
a
friend
of
hers
a
sentimental
young
lady
and
another
to
her
parents
of
the
latter
she
took
leave
in
the
most
touching
terms
she
excused
the
step
she
was
taking
by
reason
of
the
unconquerable
power
of
love
and
wound
up
by
declaring
that
she
should
consider
it
the
happiest
moment
of
her
life
when
she
was
allowed
to
throw
herself
at
the
feet
of
her
dearest
parents
sealing
both
letters
with
a
toula
seal
on
which
were
engraven
two
flaming
hearts
with
an
appropriate
inscription
she
at
last
threw
herself
upon
her
bed
before
daybreak
and
dozed
off
though
even
then
she
was
awake
tied
from
one
moment
to
another
by
terrible
thoughts
first
it
seemed
to
her
that
at
the
moment
of
entering
the
sledge
in
order
to
go
and
get
married
her
father
stopped
her
and
with
cruel
rapidity
dragged
her
over
the
snow
and
threw
her
into
a
dark
bottomless
cellar
down
which
she
fell
headlong
with
an
indescribable
sinking
of
the
heart
then
she
saw
vladimir
lying
on
the
grass
pale
and
bleeding
with
his
dying
breath
he
implored
her
to
make
haste
and
marry
him
other
hideous
and
senseless
visions
floated
before
her
one
after
another
finally
she
rose
paler
than
usual
and
with
a
real
headache
illustration
she
burst
into
tears
both
her
father
and
her
mother
remarked
her
indisposition
their
tender
anxiety
and
constant
inquiries
what
is
the
matter
with
you
masha
are
you
ill
cut
her
to
the
heart
she
tried
to
pacify
them
and
to
appear
cheerful
but
she
could
not
evening
set
in
the
idea
that
she
was
passing
the
day
for
the
last
time
in
the
midst
of
her
family
oppressed
her
in
her
secret
heart
she
took
leave
of
everybody
of
everything
which
surrounded
her
supper
was
served
her
heart
beat
violently
in
a
trembling
voice
she
declared
that
she
did
not
want
any
supper
and
wished
her
father
and
mother
they
kissed
her
and
as
usual
blessed
her
and
she
nearly
wept
reaching
her
own
room
she
threw
herself
into
an
easy
chair
and
burst
into
tears
her
maid
begged
her
to
be
calm
and
take
courage
everything
was
ready
in
masha
would
leave
for
ever
her
house
her
own
room
her
peaceful
life
as
a
young
girl
out
of
doors
the
snow
was
falling
the
wind
howling
the
shutters
rattled
and
shook
in
everything
she
seemed
to
recognise
omens
and
threats
soon
the
whole
home
was
quiet
and
asleep
masha
wrapped
herself
in
a
shawl
put
on
a
warm
cloak
and
with
a
box
in
her
hand
passed
out
on
to
the
back
staircase
the
maid
carried
two
bundles
after
her
they
descended
into
the
garden
the
snowstorm
raged
a
strong
wind
blew
against
them
as
if
trying
to
stop
the
young
culprit
with
difficulty
they
reached
the
end
of
the
garden
in
the
road
a
sledge
awaited
them
the
horses
from
cold
would
not
stand
still
vladimir
coachman
was
walking
to
and
fro
in
front
of
them
trying
to
quiet
them
he
helped
the
young
lady
and
her
maid
to
their
seats
and
packing
away
the
bundles
and
the
took
up
the
reins
and
the
horses
flew
forward
into
the
darkness
of
the
night
having
entrusted
the
young
lady
to
the
care
of
fate
and
of
tereshka
the
coachman
let
us
return
to
the
young
lover
vladimir
had
spent
the
whole
day
in
driving
in
the
morning
he
had
called
on
the
jadrino
priest
and
with
difficulty
came
to
terms
with
him
then
he
went
to
seek
for
witnesses
from
amongst
the
neighbouring
gentry
the
first
on
whom
he
called
was
a
former
cornet
of
horse
dravin
by
name
a
man
in
his
forties
who
consented
at
once
the
adventure
he
declared
reminded
him
of
old
times
and
of
his
larks
when
he
was
in
the
hussars
he
persuaded
vladimir
to
stop
to
dinner
with
him
assuring
him
that
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
getting
the
other
two
witnesses
indeed
immediately
after
dinner
in
came
the
surveyor
schmidt
with
a
moustache
and
spurs
and
the
son
of
a
a
boy
of
sixteen
who
had
recently
entered
the
uhlans
they
not
only
accepted
vladimir
proposal
but
even
swore
that
they
were
ready
to
sacrifice
their
lives
for
him
vladimir
embraced
them
with
delight
and
drove
off
to
get
everything
ready
it
had
long
been
dark
vladimir
despatched
his
trustworthy
tereshka
to
nenaradova
with
his
sledge
and
with
appropriate
instructions
for
the
occasion
for
himself
he
ordered
the
small
sledge
with
one
horse
and
started
alone
without
a
coachman
for
jadrino
where
maria
ought
to
arrive
in
a
couple
of
hours
he
knew
the
road
and
the
drive
would
only
occupy
twenty
minutes
but
vladimir
had
scarcely
passed
from
the
enclosure
into
the
open
field
when
the
wind
rose
and
soon
there
was
a
driving
snowstorm
so
heavy
and
so
severe
that
he
could
not
see
in
a
moment
the
road
was
covered
with
snow
all
landmarks
disappeared
in
the
murky
yellow
darkness
through
which
fell
white
flakes
of
snow
sky
and
earth
became
merged
into
one
vladimir
in
the
midst
of
the
field
tried
in
vain
to
get
to
the
road
the
horse
walked
on
at
random
and
every
moment
stepped
either
into
deep
snow
or
into
a
rut
so
that
the
sledge
was
constantly
upsetting
vladimir
tried
at
least
not
to
lose
the
right
direction
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
more
than
half
an
hour
had
passed
and
he
had
not
yet
reached
the
jadrino
wood
another
ten
minutes
passed
and
still
the
wood
was
invisible
vladimir
drove
across
fields
intersected
by
deep
ditches
the
snowstorm
did
not
abate
and
the
sky
did
not
clear
the
horse
was
getting
tired
and
the
perspiration
rolled
from
him
like
hail
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
every
moment
his
legs
were
disappearing
in
the
snow
at
last
vladimir
found
that
he
was
going
in
the
wrong
direction
he
stopped
began
to
reflect
recollect
and
consider
till
at
last
he
became
convinced
that
he
ought
to
have
turned
to
the
right
he
did
so
now
his
horse
could
scarcely
drag
along
but
he
had
been
more
than
an
hour
on
the
road
and
jadrino
could
not
now
be
far
he
drove
and
drove
but
there
was
no
getting
out
of
the
field
still
and
ditches
every
moment
the
sledge
was
upset
and
every
moment
vladimir
had
to
raise
it
up
time
was
slipping
by
and
vladimir
grew
seriously
anxious
at
last
in
the
distance
some
dark
object
could
be
seen
vladimir
turned
in
its
direction
and
as
he
drew
near
found
it
was
a
wood
thank
heaven
he
thought
i
am
now
near
the
end
he
drove
by
the
side
of
the
wood
hoping
to
come
at
once
upon
the
familiar
road
or
if
not
to
pass
round
the
wood
jadrino
was
situated
immediately
behind
it
he
soon
found
the
road
and
passed
into
the
darkness
of
the
wood
now
stripped
by
the
winter
the
wind
could
not
rage
here
the
road
was
smooth
the
horse
picked
up
courage
and
vladimir
was
comforted
he
drove
and
drove
but
still
jadrino
was
not
to
be
seen
there
was
no
end
to
the
wood
then
to
his
horror
he
discovered
that
he
had
got
into
a
strange
wood
he
was
in
despair
he
whipped
his
horse
and
the
poor
animal
started
off
at
a
trot
but
it
soon
got
tired
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
spite
of
all
poor
vladimir
efforts
could
only
crawl
gradually
the
trees
became
thinner
and
vladimir
drove
out
of
the
wood
but
jadrino
was
not
to
be
seen
it
must
have
been
about
midnight
tears
gushed
from
the
young
man
eyes
he
drove
on
at
random
and
now
the
weather
abated
the
clouds
dispersed
and
before
him
was
a
wide
stretch
of
plain
covered
with
a
white
billowy
carpet
the
night
was
comparatively
clear
and
he
could
see
a
small
village
a
short
distance
off
which
consisted
of
four
or
five
cottages
vladimir
drove
towards
it
at
the
first
door
he
jumped
out
of
the
sledge
ran
up
to
the
window
and
tapped
after
a
few
minutes
a
wooden
shutter
was
raised
and
an
old
man
stuck
out
his
grey
beard
what
do
you
want
how
far
is
jadrino
how
far
is
jadrino
yes
yes
is
it
far
not
far
about
ten
miles
at
this
answer
vladimir
clutched
hold
of
his
hair
and
stood
motionless
like
a
man
condemned
to
death
where
do
you
come
from
added
the
man
vladimir
had
not
the
courage
to
reply
my
man
he
said
can
you
procure
me
horses
to
jadrino
we
have
no
horses
answered
the
peasant
could
i
find
a
guide
i
will
pay
him
any
sum
he
likes
stop
said
the
old
man
dropping
the
shutter
i
will
send
my
son
out
to
you
he
will
conduct
you
vladimir
waited
scarcely
a
minute
had
passed
when
he
again
knocked
the
shutter
was
lifted
and
a
beard
was
seen
what
do
you
want
what
about
your
son
he
come
out
directly
he
is
putting
on
his
boots
are
you
cold
come
in
and
warm
yourself
thanks
send
out
your
son
quickly
the
gate
creaked
a
youth
came
out
with
a
cudgel
and
walked
on
in
front
at
one
time
pointing
out
the
road
at
another
looking
for
it
in
a
mass
of
drifted
snow
what
is
it
vladimir
asked
him
it
will
soon
be
daylight
replied
the
vladimir
spoke
not
another
word
the
cocks
were
crowing
and
it
was
light
when
they
reached
jadrino
the
church
was
closed
vladimir
paid
the
guide
and
drove
into
the
yard
of
the
priest
house
in
the
yard
his
sledge
was
not
to
be
seen
what
news
awaited
him
but
let
us
return
to
the
kind
proprietors
of
nenaradova
and
see
what
is
going
on
there
nothing
the
old
people
awoke
and
went
into
the
gavril
in
a
and
flannel
jacket
praskovia
in
a
wadded
the
samovar
was
brought
in
and
gavril
sent
the
little
maid
to
ask
maria
how
she
was
and
how
she
had
slept
the
little
maid
returned
saying
that
her
young
lady
had
slept
badly
but
that
she
was
better
now
and
that
she
would
come
into
the
in
a
moment
and
indeed
the
door
opened
and
maria
came
in
and
wished
her
papa
and
mamma
good
morning
how
is
your
masha
familiar
for
mary
inquired
gavril
better
papa
answered
masha
the
fumes
from
the
stoves
must
have
given
you
your
remarked
praskovia
perhaps
so
mamma
replied
masha
the
day
passed
well
enough
but
in
the
night
masha
was
taken
a
doctor
was
sent
for
from
town
he
came
towards
evening
and
found
the
patient
delirious
soon
she
was
in
a
severe
fever
and
in
a
fortnight
the
poor
patient
was
on
the
brink
of
the
grave
no
member
of
the
family
knew
anything
of
the
flight
from
home
the
letters
written
by
masha
the
evening
before
had
been
burnt
and
the
maid
fearing
the
wrath
of
the
master
and
mistress
had
not
breathed
a
word
the
priest
the
the
big
moustached
surveyor
and
the
little
lancer
were
equally
discreet
and
with
good
reason
tereshka
the
coachman
never
said
too
much
not
even
in
his
drink
thus
the
secret
was
kept
better
than
it
might
have
been
by
half
a
dozen
conspirators
but
maria
herself
in
the
course
of
her
long
fever
let
out
her
secret
nevertheless
her
words
were
so
disconnected
that
her
mother
who
never
left
her
bedside
could
only
make
out
from
them
that
her
daughter
was
desperately
in
love
with
vladimir
and
that
probably
love
was
the
cause
of
her
illness
she
consulted
her
husband
and
some
of
her
neighbours
and
at
last
it
was
decided
unanimously
that
the
fate
of
maria
ought
not
to
be
interfered
with
that
a
woman
must
not
ride
away
from
the
man
she
is
destined
to
marry
that
poverty
is
no
crime
that
a
woman
has
to
live
not
with
money
but
with
a
man
and
so
on
moral
proverbs
are
wonderfully
useful
on
such
occasions
when
we
can
invent
little
or
nothing
in
our
own
justification
meanwhile
the
young
lady
began
to
recover
vladimir
had
not
been
seen
for
a
long
time
in
the
house
of
gravril
so
frightened
had
he
been
by
his
previous
reception
it
was
now
resolved
to
send
and
announce
to
him
the
good
news
which
he
could
scarcely
expect
the
consent
of
her
parents
to
his
marriage
with
maria
but
what
was
the
astonishment
of
the
proprietors
of
nenaradova
when
in
answer
to
their
invitation
they
received
an
insane
reply
vladimir
informed
them
he
could
never
set
foot
in
their
house
and
begged
them
to
forget
an
unhappy
man
whose
only
hope
now
was
in
death
a
few
days
afterwards
they
heard
that
vladimir
had
left
the
place
and
joined
the
army
a
long
time
passed
before
they
ventured
to
tell
masha
who
was
now
recovering
she
never
mentioned
vladimir
some
months
later
however
finding
his
name
in
the
list
of
those
who
had
distinguished
themselves
and
been
severely
wounded
at
borodino
she
fainted
and
it
was
feared
that
the
fever
might
return
but
heaven
be
thanked
the
fainting
fit
had
no
bad
results
maria
experienced
yet
another
sorrow
her
father
died
leaving
her
the
heiress
of
all
his
property
but
the
inheritance
could
not
console
her
she
shared
sincerely
the
affliction
of
her
mother
and
vowed
she
would
never
leave
her
suitors
clustered
round
the
charming
heiress
but
she
gave
no
one
the
slightest
hope
her
mother
sometimes
tried
to
persuade
her
to
choose
a
companion
in
life
but
maria
shook
her
head
and
grew
pensive
vladimir
no
longer
existed
he
had
died
at
moscow
on
the
eve
of
the
arrival
of
the
french
his
memory
was
held
sacred
by
maria
and
she
treasured
up
everything
that
would
remind
her
of
him
books
he
had
read
drawings
which
he
had
made
songs
he
had
sung
and
the
pieces
of
poetry
which
he
had
copied
out
for
her
the
neighbours
hearing
all
this
wondered
at
her
fidelity
and
awaited
with
curiosity
the
arrival
of
the
hero
who
must
in
the
end
triumph
over
the
melancholy
constancy
of
this
virgin
artemis
meanwhile
the
war
had
been
brought
to
a
glorious
conclusion
and
our
armies
were
returning
from
abroad
the
people
ran
to
meet
them
the
music
played
by
the
regimental
bands
consisted
of
war
songs
vive
tirolese
waltzes
and
airs
from
joconde
nourished
on
the
atmosphere
of
winter
officers
who
had
started
on
the
campaign
mere
striplings
returned
grown
men
and
covered
with
decorations
the
soldiers
conversed
gaily
among
themselves
mingling
german
and
french
words
every
moment
in
their
speech
a
time
never
to
be
forgotten
a
time
of
glory
and
delight
how
quickly
beat
the
russian
heart
at
the
words
native
land
how
sweet
the
tears
of
meeting
with
what
unanimity
did
we
combine
feelings
of
national
pride
with
love
for
the
tsar
and
for
him
what
a
moment
the
women
our
russian
women
were
splendid
then
their
usual
coldness
disappeared
their
delight
was
really
intoxicating
when
meeting
the
conquerors
they
cried
hurrah
and
they
threw
up
their
caps
in
the
air
who
of
the
officers
of
that
period
does
not
own
that
to
the
russian
women
he
was
indebted
for
his
best
and
most
valued
reward
during
this
brilliant
period
maria
was
living
with
her
mother
in
retirement
and
neither
of
them
saw
how
in
both
the
capitals
the
returning
troops
were
welcomed
but
in
the
districts
and
villages
the
general
enthusiasm
was
perhaps
even
greater
illustration
a
time
of
glory
and
delight
in
these
places
the
appearance
of
an
officer
became
for
him
a
veritable
triumph
the
accepted
lover
in
plain
clothes
fared
badly
by
his
side
we
have
already
said
that
in
spite
of
her
coldness
maria
was
still
as
before
surrounded
by
suitors
but
all
had
to
fall
in
the
rear
when
there
arrived
at
her
castle
the
wounded
young
colonel
of
hussars
burmin
by
name
with
the
order
of
george
in
his
and
an
interesting
pallor
on
his
face
he
was
about
he
had
come
home
on
leave
to
his
estates
which
were
close
to
maria
villa
maria
paid
him
such
attention
as
none
of
the
others
received
in
his
presence
her
habitual
gloom
disappeared
it
could
not
be
said
that
she
flirted
with
him
but
a
poet
observing
her
behaviour
might
have
asked
s
amor
non
√®
che
dunque
burmin
was
really
a
very
agreeable
young
man
he
possessed
just
the
kind
of
sense
that
pleased
women
a
sense
of
what
is
suitable
and
becoming
he
had
no
affectation
and
was
carelessly
satirical
his
manner
towards
maria
was
simple
and
easy
he
seemed
to
be
of
a
quiet
and
modest
disposition
but
rumour
said
that
he
had
at
one
time
been
terribly
wild
this
however
did
not
harm
him
in
the
opinion
of
maria
who
like
all
other
young
ladies
excused
with
pleasure
vagaries
which
were
the
result
of
impulsiveness
and
daring
but
above
all
more
than
his
more
than
his
pleasant
talk
more
than
his
interesting
pallor
more
even
than
his
bandaged
arm
the
silence
of
the
young
hussar
excited
her
curiosity
and
her
imagination
she
could
not
help
confessing
to
herself
that
he
pleased
her
very
much
probably
he
too
with
his
acuteness
and
his
experience
had
seen
that
he
interested
her
how
was
it
then
that
up
to
this
moment
she
had
not
seen
him
at
her
feet
had
not
received
from
him
any
declaration
whatever
and
wherefore
did
she
not
encourage
him
with
more
attention
and
according
to
circumstances
even
with
tenderness
had
she
a
secret
of
her
own
which
would
account
for
her
behaviour
at
last
burmin
fell
into
such
deep
meditation
and
his
black
eyes
rested
with
such
fire
upon
maria
that
the
decisive
moment
seemed
very
near
the
neighbours
spoke
of
the
marriage
as
an
accomplished
fact
and
kind
praskovia
rejoiced
that
her
daughter
had
at
last
found
for
herself
a
worthy
mate
the
lady
was
sitting
alone
once
in
the
laying
out
when
burmin
entered
the
room
and
at
once
inquired
for
maria
she
is
in
the
garden
replied
the
old
lady
go
to
her
and
i
will
wait
for
you
here
burmin
went
and
the
old
lady
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
thought
perhaps
the
affair
will
be
settled
burmin
found
maria
in
the
beside
the
pond
with
a
book
in
her
hands
and
wearing
a
white
dress
a
veritable
heroine
of
romance
after
the
first
inquiries
maria
purposely
let
the
conversation
drop
increasing
by
these
means
the
mutual
embarrassment
from
which
it
was
only
possible
to
escape
by
means
of
a
sudden
and
positive
declaration
it
happened
thus
burmin
feeling
the
awkwardness
of
his
position
informed
maria
that
he
had
long
sought
an
opportunity
of
opening
his
heart
to
her
and
that
he
begged
for
a
moment
attention
maria
closed
the
book
and
lowered
her
eyes
as
a
sign
that
she
was
listening
i
love
you
said
burmin
i
love
you
passionately
maria
blushed
and
bent
her
head
still
lower
i
have
behaved
imprudently
yielding
as
i
have
done
to
the
seductive
pleasure
of
seeing
and
hearing
you
daily
maria
recollected
the
first
letter
of
preux
in
nouvelle
h√©lo√Øse
it
is
too
late
now
to
resist
my
fate
the
remembrance
of
you
your
dear
incomparable
image
must
from
be
at
once
the
torment
and
the
consolation
of
my
existence
i
have
now
a
grave
duty
to
perform
a
terrible
secret
to
disclose
which
will
place
between
us
an
insurmountable
barrier
illustration
in
the
ivy
bower
it
has
always
existed
interrupted
maria
i
could
never
have
been
your
wife
i
know
he
replied
quickly
i
know
that
you
once
loved
but
death
and
three
years
of
mourning
may
have
worked
some
change
dear
kind
maria
do
not
try
to
deprive
me
of
my
last
consolation
the
idea
that
you
might
have
consented
to
make
me
happy
if
do
speak
for
god
sake
do
speak
you
torture
me
yes
i
know
i
feel
that
you
could
have
been
mine
but
i
am
the
most
miserable
of
beings
i
am
already
married
maria
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
i
am
married
continued
burmin
i
have
been
married
more
than
three
years
and
do
not
know
who
my
wife
is
or
where
she
is
or
whether
i
shall
ever
see
her
again
what
are
you
saying
exclaimed
maria
how
strange
pray
continue
in
the
beginning
of
said
burmin
a
i
was
hurrying
on
to
wilna
where
my
regiment
was
stationed
arriving
one
evening
late
at
a
station
i
ordered
the
horses
to
be
got
ready
quickly
when
suddenly
a
fearful
snowstorm
broke
out
both
station
master
and
drivers
advised
me
to
wait
till
it
was
over
i
listened
to
their
advice
but
an
unaccountable
restlessness
took
possession
of
me
just
as
though
someone
was
pushing
me
on
meanwhile
the
snowstorm
did
not
abate
i
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
again
ordered
the
horses
and
started
in
the
midst
of
the
storm
the
driver
took
it
into
his
head
to
drive
along
the
river
which
would
shorten
the
distance
by
three
miles
the
banks
were
covered
with
snowdrifts
the
driver
missed
the
turning
which
would
have
brought
us
out
on
to
the
road
and
we
turned
up
in
an
unknown
place
the
storm
never
ceased
i
could
discern
a
light
and
told
the
driver
to
make
for
it
we
entered
a
village
and
found
that
the
light
proceeded
from
a
wooden
church
the
church
was
open
outside
the
railings
stood
several
sledges
and
people
passing
in
and
out
through
the
porch
here
cried
several
voices
i
told
the
coachman
to
drive
up
have
you
dawdled
said
someone
to
me
bride
has
fainted
the
priest
does
not
know
what
to
do
we
were
on
the
point
of
going
back
make
haste
and
get
out
i
got
out
of
the
sledge
in
silence
and
stepped
into
the
church
which
was
dimly
lighted
with
two
or
three
tapers
a
girl
was
sitting
in
a
dark
corner
on
a
bench
and
another
girl
was
rubbing
her
temples
god
said
the
latter
have
come
at
last
you
have
nearly
been
the
death
of
the
young
lady
the
old
priest
approached
me
saying
i
begin
begin
reverend
father
i
replied
absently
the
young
lady
was
raised
up
i
thought
her
rather
pretty
oh
wild
unpardonable
frivolity
i
placed
myself
by
her
side
at
the
altar
the
priest
hurried
on
three
men
and
the
maid
supported
the
bride
and
occupied
themselves
with
her
alone
we
were
married
your
wife
said
the
priest
my
wife
turned
her
pale
face
towards
me
i
was
going
to
kiss
her
when
she
exclaimed
it
is
not
he
not
he
and
fell
back
insensible
the
witnesses
stared
at
me
i
turned
round
and
left
the
church
without
any
attempt
being
made
to
stop
me
threw
myself
into
the
sledge
and
cried
what
exclaimed
maria
and
you
do
know
what
became
of
your
unhappy
wife
i
do
not
replied
burmin
neither
do
i
know
the
name
of
the
village
where
i
was
married
nor
that
of
the
station
from
which
i
started
at
that
time
i
thought
so
little
of
my
wicked
joke
that
on
driving
away
from
the
church
i
fell
asleep
and
never
woke
till
early
the
next
morning
after
reaching
the
third
station
the
servant
who
was
with
me
died
during
the
campaign
so
that
i
have
now
no
hope
of
ever
discovering
the
unhappy
woman
on
whom
i
played
such
a
cruel
trick
and
who
is
now
so
cruelly
avenged
great
heavens
cried
maria
seizing
his
hand
then
it
was
you
and
you
do
not
recognise
me
burmin
turned
pale
and
threw
himself
at
her
feet
the
undertaker
the
last
remaining
goods
of
the
undertaker
adrian
prohoroff
were
piled
on
the
hearse
and
the
gaunt
pair
for
the
fourth
time
dragged
the
vehicle
along
from
the
basmannaia
to
the
nikitskaia
whither
the
undertaker
had
flitted
with
all
his
household
closing
the
shop
he
nailed
to
the
gates
an
announcement
that
the
house
was
to
be
sold
or
let
and
then
started
on
foot
for
his
new
abode
approaching
the
small
yellow
house
which
had
long
attracted
his
fancy
and
which
he
at
last
bought
at
a
high
price
the
old
undertaker
was
surprised
to
find
that
his
heart
did
not
rejoice
crossing
the
strange
threshold
he
found
disorder
inside
his
new
abode
and
sighed
for
the
decrepit
hovel
where
for
eighteen
years
everything
had
been
kept
in
the
most
perfect
order
he
began
scolding
both
his
daughters
and
the
servant
for
being
so
slow
and
proceeded
to
help
them
himself
order
was
speedily
established
the
case
with
the
holy
pictures
the
cupboard
with
the
crockery
the
table
sofa
and
bedstead
took
up
their
appropriate
corners
in
the
back
room
in
the
kitchen
and
parlour
was
placed
the
master
stock
in
trade
that
is
to
say
coffins
of
every
colour
and
of
all
sizes
likewise
wardrobes
containing
mourning
hats
mantles
and
funeral
torches
over
the
gate
hung
a
signboard
representing
a
corpulent
cupid
holding
a
reversed
torch
in
his
hand
with
the
following
inscription
here
coffins
are
sold
covered
plain
or
painted
they
are
also
let
out
on
hire
and
old
ones
are
repaired
the
daughters
had
retired
to
their
own
room
adrian
went
over
his
residence
sat
down
by
the
window
and
ordered
the
samovar
to
be
got
ready
the
enlightened
reader
is
aware
that
both
shakespeare
and
walter
scott
have
represented
their
gravediggers
as
lively
jocular
people
for
the
sake
no
doubt
of
a
strong
contrast
but
respect
for
truth
prevents
me
from
following
their
example
and
i
must
confess
that
the
disposition
of
our
undertaker
corresponded
closely
with
his
melancholy
trade
adrian
prohoroff
was
usually
pensive
and
gloomy
he
only
broke
silence
to
scold
his
daughters
when
he
found
them
idle
looking
out
of
window
at
the
passers
by
or
asking
too
exorbitant
prices
for
his
products
from
those
who
had
the
misfortune
sometimes
the
pleasure
to
require
them
sitting
by
the
window
drinking
his
seventh
cup
of
tea
according
to
his
custom
adrian
was
wrapped
in
the
saddest
thoughts
he
was
thinking
of
the
pouring
rain
which
a
week
before
had
met
the
funeral
of
a
retired
brigadier
at
the
turnpike
gate
causing
many
mantles
to
shrink
and
many
hats
to
contract
he
foresaw
inevitable
outlay
his
existing
supply
of
funeral
apparel
being
in
such
a
sad
condition
but
he
hoped
to
make
good
the
loss
from
the
funeral
of
the
old
shopwoman
tiruhina
who
had
been
at
the
point
of
death
for
the
last
year
tiruhina
however
was
dying
at
basgulai
and
prohoroff
was
afraid
that
her
heirs
in
spite
of
their
promise
to
him
might
be
too
lazy
to
send
so
far
preferring
to
strike
a
bargain
with
the
nearest
contractor
these
reflections
were
interrupted
unexpectedly
by
three
freemason
knocks
at
the
door
who
is
there
enquired
the
undertaker
the
door
opened
and
a
man
in
whom
at
a
glance
might
be
recognised
a
german
artisan
entered
the
room
and
with
a
cheery
look
approached
the
undertaker
pardon
me
my
dear
neighbour
he
said
with
the
accent
which
even
now
we
russians
never
hear
without
a
smile
pardon
me
for
disturbing
you
i
wanted
to
make
your
acquaintance
at
once
i
am
a
bootmaker
my
name
is
gottlieb
schultz
i
live
in
the
next
street
in
that
little
house
opposite
your
windows
to
morrow
i
celebrate
my
silver
wedding
and
i
want
you
and
your
daughters
to
dine
with
me
in
a
friendly
way
the
invitation
was
accepted
the
undertaker
asked
the
bootmaker
to
sit
down
and
have
a
cup
of
tea
and
thanks
to
gottlieb
schultz
frank
disposition
they
were
soon
talking
in
a
friendly
way
how
does
your
business
get
on
enquired
adrian
oh
oh
replied
schultz
one
way
and
another
i
have
no
reason
to
complain
though
of
course
my
goods
are
not
like
yours
a
living
man
can
do
without
boots
but
a
corpse
can
not
do
without
a
coffin
perfectly
true
said
adrian
still
if
a
living
man
has
nothing
to
buy
boots
with
he
goes
barefooted
whereas
the
destitute
corpse
gets
his
coffin
sometimes
for
nothing
their
conversation
continued
in
this
style
for
some
time
until
at
last
the
bootmaker
rose
and
took
leave
of
the
undertaker
repeating
his
invitation
next
day
punctually
at
twelve
the
undertaker
and
his
daughters
passed
out
at
the
gate
of
their
house
and
proceeded
to
their
neighbours
i
do
not
intend
to
describe
russian
caftan
nor
the
european
dress
of
akulina
or
daria
contrary
though
this
be
to
the
custom
of
of
the
present
day
i
do
however
think
it
superfluous
to
mention
that
both
maidens
wore
yellow
bonnets
and
scarlet
shoes
which
they
only
did
on
great
occasions
the
bootmaker
small
lodging
was
filled
with
guests
principally
german
artisans
their
wives
and
assistants
of
russian
officials
there
was
only
one
watchman
the
finn
yurko
who
had
managed
in
spite
of
his
humble
position
to
gain
the
special
favour
of
his
chief
he
had
also
performed
the
functions
of
postman
for
about
years
serving
truly
and
faithfully
the
people
of
pogorelsk
the
fire
which
in
the
year
consumed
the
capital
burnt
at
the
same
time
his
humble
sentry
box
but
no
sooner
had
the
enemy
fled
when
in
its
place
appeared
a
small
new
grey
sentry
box
with
tiny
white
columns
of
doric
architecture
and
yurko
resumed
his
patrol
in
front
of
it
with
on
shoulder
and
in
the
civic
armour
of
the
police
uniform
he
was
well
known
to
the
greater
portion
of
the
german
residents
near
the
nikitski
gates
some
of
whom
had
occasionally
even
passed
the
night
from
sunday
until
monday
in
yurko
box
adrian
promptly
made
friends
with
a
man
of
whom
sooner
or
later
he
might
have
need
and
as
the
guests
were
just
then
going
in
to
dinner
they
sat
down
together
and
schultz
and
their
daughter
the
lotchen
while
dining
with
their
guests
attended
to
their
wants
and
assisted
the
cook
to
wait
upon
them
beer
flowed
yurko
ate
for
four
and
adrian
did
not
fall
short
of
him
though
his
daughters
stood
upon
ceremony
the
conversation
which
was
in
german
grew
louder
every
hour
suddenly
the
host
called
for
the
attention
of
the
company
and
opening
a
bottle
exclaimed
loudly
in
russian
the
health
of
my
good
louisa
the
imitation
champagne
frothed
the
host
kissed
tenderly
the
fresh
face
of
his
old
spouse
and
the
guests
drank
vociferously
the
health
of
good
louisa
the
health
of
my
dear
guests
cried
the
host
opening
the
second
bottle
the
guests
thanked
him
and
emptied
their
glasses
then
one
toast
followed
another
the
health
of
each
guest
was
proposed
separately
then
the
health
of
moscow
and
of
about
a
dozen
german
towns
they
drank
the
health
of
the
guilds
in
general
and
afterwards
of
each
one
separately
the
health
of
the
foremen
and
of
the
workmen
adrian
drank
with
a
will
and
became
so
lively
that
he
himself
proposed
some
jocular
toast
suddenly
one
of
the
guests
a
stout
baker
raised
his
glass
and
exclaimed
the
health
of
our
customers
this
toast
like
all
the
others
was
drunk
joyfully
and
unanimously
the
guests
nodded
to
each
other
the
tailor
to
the
bootmaker
the
bootmaker
to
the
tailor
the
baker
to
them
both
and
all
to
the
baker
yurko
in
the
midst
of
this
bowing
called
out
as
he
turned
towards
his
neighbour
now
then
my
friend
drink
to
the
health
of
your
corpses
everybody
laughed
except
the
undertaker
who
felt
himself
affronted
and
frowned
no
one
noticed
this
and
the
guests
went
on
drinking
till
the
bells
began
to
ring
for
evening
service
when
they
all
rose
from
the
table
the
party
had
broken
up
late
and
most
of
the
guests
were
very
hilarious
the
stout
baker
with
the
bookbinder
whose
face
looked
as
if
it
were
bound
in
red
morocco
led
yurko
by
the
arms
to
his
sentry
box
thus
putting
in
practice
the
proverb
one
good
turns
deserves
another
the
undertaker
went
home
drunk
and
angry
how
indeed
he
exclaimed
aloud
is
my
trade
worse
than
any
other
is
an
undertaker
own
brother
to
the
executioner
what
have
the
infidels
to
laugh
at
is
an
undertaker
a
hypocritical
buffoon
i
should
have
liked
to
invite
them
to
a
housewarming
to
give
them
a
grand
spread
but
no
that
shall
not
be
i
will
ask
my
customers
instead
my
orthodox
corpses
what
exclaimed
the
servant
who
at
that
moment
was
taking
off
the
undertaker
boots
what
is
that
sir
you
are
saying
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
invite
corpses
to
your
housewarming
how
awful
i
will
certainly
invite
them
persisted
adrian
and
not
later
than
for
honour
me
my
benefactors
with
your
company
evening
at
a
feast
i
will
offer
you
what
god
has
given
me
with
these
words
the
undertaker
retired
to
bed
and
was
soon
snoring
it
was
still
dark
when
adrian
awoke
the
shopkeeper
triuhina
had
died
in
the
night
and
her
steward
had
sent
a
special
messenger
on
horseback
to
inform
adrian
of
the
fact
the
undertaker
gave
him
a
a
silver
fourpenny
bit
for
his
trouble
to
buy
with
dressed
hurriedly
took
an
and
drove
off
to
rasgulai
at
the
gate
of
the
dead
woman
house
the
police
were
already
standing
and
dealers
in
mourning
goods
were
hovering
around
like
ravens
who
have
scented
a
corpse
the
defunct
was
lying
in
state
on
the
table
yellow
like
wax
but
not
yet
disfigured
by
decomposition
hear
her
in
a
crowd
were
relations
friends
and
domestics
all
the
windows
were
open
wax
tapers
were
burning
and
the
clergy
were
reading
prayers
adrian
went
up
to
the
nephew
a
young
shopman
in
a
fashionable
and
informed
him
that
the
coffin
tapers
pall
and
the
funeral
paraphernalia
in
general
would
promptly
arrive
the
heir
thanked
him
in
an
absent
manner
saying
that
he
would
not
bargain
about
the
price
but
leave
it
all
to
his
conscience
the
undertaker
as
usual
vowed
that
his
charges
should
be
moderate
exchanged
significant
glances
with
the
steward
and
left
to
make
the
necessary
preparations
the
whole
day
was
spent
in
travelling
from
rasgulai
to
the
nikitski
grates
and
back
again
towards
evening
everything
was
settled
and
he
started
home
on
foot
after
discharging
his
hired
it
was
a
moonlight
night
and
the
undertaker
got
safely
to
the
nikitski
grates
at
yosnessenia
he
met
our
acquaintance
yurko
who
recognising
the
undertaker
wished
him
it
was
late
the
undertaker
was
close
to
his
house
when
he
thought
he
saw
some
one
approach
the
gates
open
the
wicket
and
go
in
what
does
it
mean
thought
adrian
who
can
be
wanting
me
again
is
it
a
burglar
or
can
my
foolish
girls
have
lovers
coming
after
them
there
is
no
telling
and
the
undertaker
was
on
the
point
of
calling
his
friend
yurko
to
his
assistance
when
some
one
else
came
up
to
the
wicket
and
was
about
to
enter
but
seeing
the
master
of
the
house
run
towards
him
he
stopped
and
took
off
his
three
cornered
hat
his
face
seemed
familiar
to
adrian
but
in
his
hurry
he
had
not
been
able
to
see
it
properly
you
want
me
said
adrian
out
of
breath
walk
in
if
you
please
do
stand
on
ceremony
my
friend
replied
the
other
in
a
hollow
voice
go
first
and
show
your
guest
the
way
adrian
had
no
time
to
waste
on
formality
the
gate
was
open
and
he
went
up
to
the
steps
followed
by
the
other
adrian
heard
people
walking
about
in
his
rooms
what
the
devil
is
this
he
wondered
and
he
hastened
to
see
but
now
his
legs
seemed
to
be
giving
way
the
room
was
full
of
corpses
the
moon
shining
through
the
windows
lit
up
their
yellow
and
blue
faces
sunken
mouths
dim
eyes
and
protruding
noses
to
his
horror
adrian
recognised
in
them
people
he
had
buried
and
in
the
guest
who
came
in
with
him
the
brigadier
who
had
been
interred
during
a
pouring
rain
they
all
ladies
and
gentlemen
surrounded
the
undertaker
bowing
and
greeting
him
affably
except
one
poor
fellow
lately
buried
gratis
who
ashamed
of
his
rags
kept
at
a
distance
in
a
corner
of
the
room
the
others
were
all
decently
clad
the
female
corpses
in
caps
and
ribbons
the
soldiers
and
officials
in
their
uniforms
but
with
unshaven
beards
and
the
tradespeople
in
their
best
caftans
prohoroff
said
the
brigadier
speaking
on
behalf
of
all
the
company
we
have
all
risen
to
profit
by
your
invitation
only
those
have
stopped
at
home
who
were
quite
unable
to
do
otherwise
who
have
crumbled
away
and
have
nothing
left
but
bare
bones
even
among
those
there
was
one
who
could
not
resist
he
wanted
so
much
to
come
at
this
moment
a
diminutive
skeleton
pushed
his
way
through
the
crowd
and
approached
adrian
his
death
head
grinned
affably
at
the
undertaker
shreds
of
green
and
red
cloth
and
of
rotten
linen
hung
on
him
as
on
a
pole
while
the
bones
of
his
feet
clattered
inside
his
heavy
boots
like
pestles
in
mortars
you
do
not
recognise
me
prohoroff
said
the
skeleton
you
remember
the
retired
sergeant
in
the
guards
peter
petrovitch
kurilkin
him
to
whom
you
in
the
year
sold
your
first
coffin
and
of
deal
instead
of
oak
with
these
words
the
corpse
stretched
out
his
long
arms
to
embrace
him
but
adrian
collecting
his
strength
shrieked
and
pushed
him
away
peter
petrovitch
staggered
fell
over
and
crumbled
to
pieces
there
was
a
murmur
of
indignation
among
the
company
of
corpses
all
stood
up
for
the
honour
of
their
companion
threatening
and
abusing
adrian
till
the
poor
man
deafened
by
their
shrieks
and
quite
overcome
lost
his
senses
and
fell
unconscious
among
the
bones
of
the
retired
sergeant
of
the
guard
the
sun
had
been
shining
for
sometime
upon
the
bed
on
which
the
undertaker
lay
when
he
at
last
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
the
servant
lighting
the
with
horror
he
recalled
all
the
incidents
of
the
previous
day
triuchin
the
brigadier
and
the
sergeant
kurilkin
passed
dimly
before
his
imagination
he
waited
in
silence
for
the
servant
to
speak
and
tell
him
what
had
occurred
during
the
night
how
you
have
slept
adrian
prohorovitch
said
aksima
handing
him
his
your
neighbour
the
tailor
called
also
the
watchman
to
say
that
was
turko
namesday
but
you
were
so
fast
asleep
that
we
did
not
disturb
you
did
anyone
come
from
the
late
triuhina
the
late
is
she
dead
then
what
a
fool
did
you
help
me
yesterday
to
make
arrangements
for
her
funeral
oh
my
little
father
are
you
mad
or
are
you
still
suffering
from
last
night
drink
you
were
feasting
all
day
at
the
german
you
came
home
drunk
threw
yourself
on
the
bed
and
and
have
slept
till
now
when
the
bells
have
stopped
ringing
for
mass
really
exclaimed
the
undertaker
delighted
at
the
explanation
of
course
replied
the
servant
well
if
that
is
the
case
let
us
have
tea
quickly
and
call
my
daughters
the
postmaster
who
has
not
cursed
the
postmaster
who
has
not
quarrelled
with
him
who
in
a
moment
of
anger
has
not
demanded
the
fatal
hook
to
write
his
ineffectual
complaint
against
extortion
rudeness
and
unpunctuality
who
does
not
consider
him
a
human
monster
equal
only
to
our
extinct
attorney
or
at
least
to
the
brigands
of
the
murom
woods
let
us
however
be
just
and
place
ourselves
in
his
position
and
perhaps
we
shall
judge
him
less
severely
what
is
a
postmaster
a
real
martyr
of
the
class
of
nobility
only
protected
by
his
rank
from
personal
violence
and
that
not
always
i
appeal
to
the
conscience
of
my
readers
what
is
the
position
of
this
dictator
as
prince
yiasemsky
jokingly
calls
him
is
it
not
really
that
of
a
galley
slave
no
rest
for
him
day
or
night
all
the
irritation
accumulated
in
the
course
of
a
dull
journey
by
the
traveller
is
vented
upon
the
postmaster
if
the
weather
is
intolerable
the
road
wretched
the
driver
obstinate
or
the
horses
intractable
the
postmaster
is
to
blame
entering
his
humble
abode
the
traveller
looks
upon
him
as
his
enemy
and
the
postmaster
is
lucky
if
he
gets
rid
of
his
uninvited
guest
soon
but
should
there
happen
to
be
no
horses
heavens
what
abuse
what
threats
are
showered
upon
his
head
through
rain
and
mud
he
is
obliged
to
seek
them
so
that
during
a
storm
or
in
the
winter
frosts
he
is
often
glad
to
take
refuge
in
the
cold
passage
in
order
to
snatch
a
few
moments
of
repose
and
to
escape
from
the
shrieking
and
pushing
of
irritated
guests
if
a
general
arrives
the
trembling
postmaster
supplies
him
with
the
two
last
remaining
team
of
three
horses
abreast
of
which
one
ought
perhaps
to
have
been
reserved
for
the
diligence
the
general
drives
on
without
even
a
word
of
thanks
five
minutes
later
the
postmaster
hears
a
bell
and
the
guard
throws
down
his
travelling
certificate
on
the
table
before
him
let
us
realize
all
this
and
instead
of
anger
we
shall
feel
sincere
pity
for
the
postmaster
a
few
words
more
in
the
course
of
twenty
years
i
have
travelled
all
over
russia
and
know
nearly
all
the
mail
routes
i
have
made
the
acquaintance
of
several
generations
of
drivers
there
are
few
postmasters
whom
i
do
not
know
personally
and
few
with
whom
i
have
not
had
dealings
my
curious
collection
of
travelling
experiences
i
hope
shortly
to
publish
at
present
i
will
only
say
that
as
a
class
the
postmaster
is
presented
to
the
public
in
a
false
light
this
personage
is
generally
a
peaceful
obliging
sociable
modest
man
and
not
too
fond
of
money
from
his
conversation
which
the
travelling
gentry
very
wrongly
despise
much
interesting
and
instructive
information
may
be
acquired
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
profess
that
i
prefer
his
talk
to
that
of
some
official
of
the
class
travelling
for
the
government
it
may
easily
be
guessed
that
i
have
some
friends
among
the
honourable
class
of
postmasters
indeed
the
memory
of
one
of
them
is
very
dear
to
me
circumstances
at
one
time
brought
us
together
and
it
is
of
him
that
i
now
intend
to
tell
my
dear
readers
in
the
may
of
i
chanced
to
be
passing
through
the
government
of
along
a
road
now
no
longer
existing
i
held
a
small
rank
and
was
travelling
with
relays
of
three
horses
while
paying
only
for
two
consequently
the
postmaster
stood
upon
no
ceremony
with
me
but
i
had
often
to
take
from
him
by
force
what
i
considered
to
be
mine
by
right
being
young
and
passionate
i
was
indignant
at
the
meanness
and
cowardice
of
the
postmaster
when
he
handed
over
the
prepared
for
me
to
some
official
gentleman
of
higher
rank
it
also
took
me
a
long
time
to
get
over
the
offence
when
a
servant
fond
of
making
distinctions
missed
me
when
waiting
at
the
table
now
the
one
and
the
other
appear
to
me
to
be
quite
in
the
natural
course
of
things
indeed
what
would
become
of
us
if
instead
of
the
convenient
rule
that
rank
gives
precedence
to
rank
the
rule
were
to
be
reversed
and
mind
made
to
give
precedence
to
mind
what
disputes
would
arise
besides
to
whom
would
the
attendants
first
hand
the
dishes
but
to
return
to
my
story
the
day
was
hot
about
three
versts
from
the
station
it
began
to
spit
and
a
minute
afterwards
there
was
a
pouring
rain
and
i
was
soon
drenched
to
the
skin
arriving
at
the
station
my
first
care
was
to
change
my
clothes
and
then
i
asked
for
a
cup
of
tea
hi
dunia
called
out
the
postmaster
prepare
the
and
fetch
some
cream
in
obedience
to
this
command
a
girl
of
fourteen
appeared
from
behind
the
partition
and
ran
out
into
the
passage
i
was
struck
by
her
beauty
is
that
your
daughter
i
inquired
of
the
postmaster
yes
he
answered
with
a
look
of
gratified
pride
and
such
a
good
clever
girl
just
like
her
late
mother
then
while
he
took
note
of
my
travelling
certificate
i
occupied
the
time
in
examining
the
pictures
which
decorated
the
walls
of
his
humble
abode
they
were
illustrations
of
the
story
of
the
prodigal
son
in
the
firsts
a
venerable
old
man
in
a
skull
cap
and
dressing
gown
is
wishing
to
the
restless
youth
who
naturally
receives
his
blessing
and
a
bag
of
money
in
another
the
dissipated
life
of
the
young
man
is
painted
in
glaring
colours
he
is
sitting
at
a
table
surrounded
by
false
friends
and
shameless
women
in
the
next
picture
the
ruined
youth
in
his
shirt
sleeves
and
a
hat
is
taking
care
of
some
swine
while
sharing
their
food
his
face
expresses
deep
sorrow
and
contrition
finally
there
was
the
representation
of
his
return
to
his
father
the
kind
old
man
in
the
same
cap
and
dressing
gown
runs
out
to
meet
him
the
prodigal
son
falls
on
his
knees
before
him
in
the
distance
the
cook
is
killing
the
fatted
calf
and
the
eldest
son
is
asking
the
servants
the
reason
of
all
this
rejoicing
at
the
foot
of
each
picture
i
read
some
appropriate
german
verses
i
remember
them
all
distinctly
as
well
as
some
pots
of
balsams
the
bed
with
the
speckled
curtains
and
many
other
characteristic
surroundings
i
can
see
the
stationmaster
at
this
moment
a
man
about
fifty
years
of
age
fresh
and
strong
in
a
long
green
coat
with
three
medals
on
faded
ribbons
i
had
scarcely
time
to
settle
with
my
old
driver
when
dunia
returned
with
the
the
little
coquette
saw
at
a
second
glance
the
impression
she
had
produced
upon
me
she
lowered
her
large
blue
eyes
i
spoke
to
her
and
she
replied
confidently
like
a
girl
accustomed
to
society
i
offered
a
glass
of
punch
to
her
father
to
dunia
i
handed
a
cup
of
tea
then
we
all
three
fell
into
easy
conversation
as
if
we
had
known
each
other
all
our
lives
the
horses
had
been
waiting
a
long
while
but
i
was
loth
to
part
from
the
postmaster
and
his
daughter
at
last
i
took
leave
of
them
the
father
wishing
me
a
pleasant
journey
while
the
daughter
saw
me
to
the
in
the
corridor
i
stopped
and
asked
permission
to
kiss
her
dunia
consented
i
can
remember
a
great
many
kisses
since
then
but
none
which
left
such
a
lasting
such
a
delightful
impression
several
years
passed
when
circumstances
brought
me
back
to
the
same
tract
to
the
very
same
places
i
recollected
the
old
postmasters
daughter
and
rejoiced
at
the
prospect
of
seeing
her
again
but
i
thought
perhaps
the
old
postmaster
has
been
changed
and
dunia
may
be
already
married
the
idea
that
one
or
the
other
might
be
dead
also
passed
through
my
mind
and
i
approached
the
station
of
with
sad
presentiments
the
horses
drew
up
at
the
small
station
house
i
entered
the
and
instantly
recognised
the
pictures
representing
the
story
of
the
prodigal
son
the
table
and
the
bed
stood
in
their
old
places
but
the
flowers
on
the
window
sills
had
disappeared
while
all
the
surroundings
showed
neglect
and
decay
the
postmaster
was
asleep
under
his
but
my
arrival
awoke
him
and
he
rose
it
was
certainly
simeon
virin
but
how
aged
while
he
was
preparing
to
make
a
copy
of
my
travelling
certificate
i
looked
at
his
grey
hairs
and
the
deep
wrinkles
in
his
long
unshaven
face
his
bent
back
and
i
was
amazed
to
see
how
three
or
four
years
had
managed
to
change
a
strong
man
into
a
frail
old
one
do
you
recognise
me
i
asked
him
we
are
old
friends
may
be
he
replied
gloomily
this
is
a
highway
and
many
travellers
have
passed
through
here
is
your
dunia
well
i
added
the
old
man
frowned
heaven
knows
he
answered
apparently
she
is
married
i
said
the
old
man
pretended
not
to
hear
my
question
and
in
a
low
voice
went
on
reading
my
travelling
certificate
i
ceased
my
inquiries
and
ordered
hot
water
my
curiosity
was
becoming
painful
and
i
hoped
that
the
punch
would
loosen
the
tongue
of
my
old
friend
i
was
not
mistaken
the
old
man
did
not
refuse
the
proffered
tumbler
i
noticed
that
the
rum
dispelled
his
gloom
at
the
second
glass
he
became
talkative
remembered
or
at
any
rate
looked
as
if
he
remembered
me
and
i
heard
the
story
which
at
the
time
interested
me
and
even
affected
me
much
so
you
knew
my
dunia
he
began
but
then
who
did
not
oh
dunia
dunia
what
a
beautiful
girl
you
were
you
were
admired
and
praised
by
every
traveller
no
one
had
a
word
to
say
against
her
the
ladies
gave
her
presents
one
a
handkerchief
another
a
pair
of
earrings
the
gentlemen
stopped
on
purpose
as
if
to
dine
or
to
take
supper
but
really
only
to
take
a
longer
look
at
her
however
rough
a
man
might
be
he
became
subdued
in
her
presence
and
spoke
graciously
to
me
will
you
believe
me
sir
couriers
and
special
messengers
would
talk
to
her
for
at
the
time
she
was
the
support
of
the
house
she
kept
everything
in
order
did
everything
and
looked
after
everything
while
i
the
old
fool
that
i
was
could
not
see
enough
of
her
or
pet
her
sufficiently
how
i
loved
her
how
i
indulged
my
child
surely
her
life
was
a
happy
one
but
no
fate
is
not
to
be
avoided
then
he
began
to
tell
me
his
sorrow
in
detail
three
years
before
one
winter
evening
while
the
postmaster
was
ruling
a
new
book
his
daughter
in
the
next
partition
was
busy
making
herself
a
dress
when
a
drove
up
and
a
traveller
wearing
a
circassian
hat
and
a
long
military
overcoat
and
muffled
in
a
shawl
entered
the
room
and
demanded
horses
the
horses
were
all
out
hearing
this
the
traveller
had
raised
his
voice
and
his
whip
when
dunia
accustomed
to
such
scenes
rushed
out
from
behind
the
partition
and
inquired
pleasantly
whether
he
would
not
like
something
to
eat
her
appearance
produced
the
usual
effect
the
passenger
rage
subsided
he
agreed
to
wait
for
horses
and
ordered
some
supper
he
took
off
his
wet
hat
unloosed
the
shawl
and
divested
himself
of
his
long
overcoat
the
traveller
was
a
tall
young
hussar
with
a
small
black
moustache
he
settled
down
comfortably
at
the
postmaster
and
began
a
lively
conversation
with
him
and
his
daughter
supper
was
served
meanwhile
the
horses
returned
and
the
postmaster
ordered
them
instantly
without
being
fed
to
be
harnessed
to
the
traveller
but
returning
to
the
room
he
found
the
young
man
senseless
on
the
bench
where
he
lay
in
a
faint
such
a
headache
had
attacked
him
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
continue
his
journey
what
was
to
be
done
the
postmaster
gave
up
his
own
bed
to
him
and
it
was
arranged
that
if
the
patient
was
not
better
the
next
morning
to
send
to
c
for
the
doctor
next
day
the
hussar
was
worse
his
servant
rode
to
the
town
to
fetch
the
doctor
dunia
bound
up
his
head
with
a
handkerchief
moistened
in
vinegar
and
sat
down
with
her
needlework
by
his
bedside
in
the
presence
of
the
postmaster
the
invalid
groaned
and
scarcely
said
a
word
nevertheless
he
drank
two
cups
of
coffee
and
still
groaning
ordered
a
good
dinner
dunia
never
left
him
every
time
he
asked
for
a
drink
dunia
handed
him
the
jug
of
lemonade
prepared
by
herself
after
moistening
his
lips
the
patient
each
time
he
returned
the
jug
gave
her
hand
a
gentle
pressure
in
token
of
gratitude
towards
dinner
time
the
doctor
arrived
he
felt
the
patient
pulse
spoke
to
him
in
german
and
in
russian
declared
that
all
he
required
was
rest
and
said
that
in
a
couple
of
days
he
would
be
able
to
start
on
his
journey
the
hussar
handed
him
rubles
for
his
visit
and
gave
him
an
invitation
to
dinner
which
the
doctor
accepted
they
both
ate
with
a
good
appetite
and
drank
a
bottle
of
wine
between
them
then
very
pleased
with
one
another
they
separated
another
day
passed
and
the
hussar
had
quite
recovered
he
became
very
lively
incessantly
joking
first
with
dunia
then
with
the
postmaster
whistling
tunes
conversing
with
the
passengers
copying
their
travelling
certificates
into
the
station
book
and
so
ingratiating
himself
that
on
the
third
day
the
good
postmaster
regretted
parting
with
his
dear
lodger
it
was
sunday
and
dunia
was
getting
ready
to
attend
mass
the
was
at
the
door
he
took
leave
of
the
postmaster
after
recompensing
him
handsomely
for
his
board
and
lodging
wished
dunia
and
proposed
to
drop
her
at
the
church
which
was
situated
at
the
other
end
of
the
village
dunia
hesitated
what
are
you
afraid
of
asked
her
father
his
nobility
is
not
a
wolf
he
wo
eat
you
drive
with
him
as
far
as
the
church
dunia
got
into
the
carriage
by
the
side
of
the
hussar
the
servant
jumped
on
the
coach
box
the
coachman
gave
a
whistle
and
the
horses
went
off
at
a
gallop
the
poor
postmaster
could
not
understand
how
he
came
to
allow
his
dunia
to
drive
off
with
the
hussar
how
he
could
have
been
so
blind
and
what
had
become
of
his
senses
before
had
passed
his
heart
misgave
him
it
ached
and
he
became
so
uneasy
that
he
could
bear
the
situation
no
longer
and
started
for
the
church
himself
approaching
the
church
he
saw
that
the
people
were
already
dispersing
but
dunia
was
neither
in
the
churchyard
nor
at
the
entrance
he
hurried
into
the
church
the
priest
was
just
leaving
the
altar
the
clerk
was
extinguishing
the
tapers
two
old
women
were
still
praying
in
a
corner
but
dunia
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
the
poor
father
could
scarcely
summon
courage
to
ask
the
clerk
if
she
had
been
to
mass
the
clerk
replied
that
she
had
not
the
postmaster
returned
home
neither
dead
nor
alive
he
had
only
one
hope
left
that
dunia
in
the
flightiness
of
her
youth
had
perhaps
resolved
to
drive
as
far
as
the
next
station
where
her
godmother
lived
in
patient
agitation
he
awaited
the
return
of
the
with
which
he
had
allowed
her
to
drive
off
but
the
driver
did
not
come
back
at
last
towards
night
he
arrived
alone
and
tipsy
with
the
fatal
news
that
dunia
had
gone
on
with
the
hussar
the
old
man
succumbed
to
his
misfortune
and
took
to
his
bed
the
same
bed
where
the
day
before
the
young
impostor
had
lain
recalling
all
the
circumstances
the
postmaster
understood
now
that
the
illness
had
been
shammed
the
poor
fellow
sickened
with
severe
fever
he
was
removed
to
c
and
in
his
place
another
man
was
temporarily
appointed
the
same
doctor
who
had
visited
the
hussar
attended
him
he
assured
the
postmaster
that
the
young
man
had
been
perfectly
well
that
he
had
from
the
first
had
suspicions
of
his
evil
intentions
but
that
he
had
kept
silent
for
fear
of
his
whip
whether
the
german
doctor
spoke
the
truth
or
was
anxious
only
to
prove
his
great
penetration
his
assurance
brought
no
consolation
to
the
poor
patient
as
soon
as
he
was
beginning
to
recover
from
his
illness
the
old
postmaster
asked
his
superior
postmaster
of
the
town
of
c
for
two
months
leave
of
absence
and
without
saying
a
word
to
anyone
he
started
off
on
foot
to
look
for
his
daughter
from
the
station
book
he
discovered
that
captain
minsky
had
left
smolensk
for
petersburg
the
coachman
who
drove
him
said
that
dunia
had
wept
all
the
way
though
she
seemed
to
be
going
of
her
own
free
will
perhaps
thought
the
station
master
i
shall
bring
back
my
strayed
lamb
with
this
idea
he
reached
petersburg
and
stopped
with
the
ismailovsky
regiment
in
the
quarters
of
a
officer
his
old
comrade
in
arms
beginning
his
search
he
soon
found
out
that
captain
minsky
was
in
petersburg
living
at
demuth
hotel
the
postmaster
determined
to
see
him
early
in
the
morning
he
went
to
minsky
antechamber
and
asked
to
have
his
nobility
informed
that
an
old
soldier
wished
to
see
him
the
military
attendant
in
the
act
of
cleaning
a
boot
on
a
informed
him
that
his
master
was
asleep
and
never
received
anyone
before
eleven
the
postmaster
left
to
return
at
the
appointed
time
minsky
came
out
to
him
in
his
dressing
gown
and
red
skull
cap
well
my
friend
what
do
you
want
he
inquired
the
old
maids
heart
boiled
tears
started
to
his
eyes
and
in
a
trembling
voice
he
could
only
say
your
nobility
be
divinely
merciful
minsky
glanced
quickly
at
him
flushed
and
seizing
him
by
the
hand
led
him
into
his
study
and
locked
the
door
your
nobility
continued
the
old
man
what
has
fallen
from
the
cart
is
lost
give
me
back
at
any
rate
my
dunia
let
her
go
do
not
ruin
her
entirely
what
is
done
can
not
be
undone
replied
the
young
man
in
extreme
confusion
i
am
guilty
before
you
and
ready
to
ask
your
pardon
but
do
not
imagine
that
i
could
neglect
dunia
she
shall
be
happy
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
why
do
you
want
her
she
loves
me
she
has
forsaken
her
former
existence
neither
you
nor
she
can
forget
what
has
happened
then
pushing
something
up
his
sleeve
he
opened
the
door
and
the
postmaster
found
himself
he
knew
not
how
in
the
street
he
stood
long
motionless
at
last
catching
sight
of
a
roll
of
papers
inside
his
cuff
he
pulled
them
out
and
unrolled
several
fifty
ruble
notes
his
eyes
again
filled
with
tears
tears
of
indignation
he
crushed
the
notes
into
a
ball
threw
them
on
the
ground
and
stamping
on
them
with
his
heel
walked
away
after
a
few
steps
he
stopped
reflected
a
moment
and
turned
back
but
the
notes
were
gone
a
young
man
who
had
observed
him
ran
towards
an
got
in
hurriedly
and
called
to
the
driver
to
be
off
the
postmaster
did
not
pursue
him
he
had
resolved
to
return
home
to
his
but
before
doing
so
he
wished
to
see
his
poor
dunia
once
more
with
this
view
a
couple
of
days
afterwards
he
returned
to
minsky
lodgings
but
the
military
servant
told
him
roughly
that
his
master
received
nobody
pushed
him
out
of
the
antechamber
and
slammed
the
door
in
his
face
the
postmaster
stood
and
stood
and
at
last
went
away
that
same
day
in
the
evening
he
was
walking
along
the
leteinaia
having
been
to
service
at
the
church
of
the
all
saints
when
a
smart
flew
past
him
and
in
it
the
postmaster
recognised
minsky
the
stopped
in
front
of
a
house
at
the
very
entrance
and
the
hussar
ran
up
the
steps
a
happy
thought
occurred
to
the
postmaster
he
retraced
his
steps
whose
horses
are
these
he
inquired
of
the
coachman
do
they
belong
to
minsky
exactly
so
replied
the
coachman
why
do
you
ask
why
your
master
told
me
to
deliver
a
note
for
him
to
his
dunia
and
i
have
forgotten
where
his
dunia
lives
she
lives
here
on
the
second
floor
but
you
are
too
late
my
friend
with
your
note
he
is
there
himself
now
no
matter
answered
the
postmaster
who
had
an
undefinable
sensation
at
his
heart
thanks
for
your
information
i
shall
be
able
to
manage
my
business
with
these
words
he
ascended
the
steps
the
door
was
locked
he
rang
there
were
several
seconds
of
painful
delay
then
the
key
jingled
and
the
door
opened
does
avdotia
simeonovna
live
here
he
inquired
she
does
replied
the
young
what
do
you
want
with
her
the
postmaster
did
not
reply
but
walked
on
you
must
not
must
not
she
called
after
him
avdotia
simeonovna
has
visitors
but
the
postmaster
without
listening
went
on
the
first
two
rooms
were
dark
in
the
third
there
was
a
light
he
approached
the
open
door
and
stopped
in
the
room
which
was
beautifully
furnished
sat
minsky
in
deep
thought
dunia
dressed
in
all
the
splendour
of
the
latest
fashion
sat
on
the
arm
of
his
easy
chair
like
a
rider
on
an
english
side
saddle
she
was
looking
tenderly
at
minsky
while
twisting
his
black
locks
round
her
glittering
fingers
poor
postmaster
his
daughter
had
never
before
seemed
so
beautiful
to
him
in
spite
of
himself
he
stood
admiring
her
who
is
there
she
asked
without
raising
her
head
he
was
silent
receiving
no
reply
dunia
looked
up
and
with
a
cry
she
fell
on
the
carpet
minsky
in
alarm
rushed
to
pick
her
up
when
suddenly
seeing
the
old
postmaster
in
the
doorway
he
left
dunia
and
approached
him
trembling
with
rage
what
do
you
want
he
inquired
clenching
his
teeth
why
do
you
steal
after
me
everywhere
like
a
burglar
or
do
you
want
to
murder
me
begone
and
with
a
strong
hand
he
seized
the
old
man
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
pushed
him
down
the
stairs
the
old
man
went
back
to
his
rooms
his
friend
advised
him
to
take
proceedings
but
the
postmaster
reflected
waved
his
hand
and
decided
to
give
the
matter
up
two
days
afterwards
he
left
petersburg
for
his
station
and
resumed
his
duties
this
is
the
third
year
he
concluded
that
i
am
living
without
my
dunia
and
i
have
had
no
tidings
whatever
of
her
whether
she
is
alive
or
not
god
knows
many
tilings
happen
she
is
not
the
first
nor
the
last
whom
a
wandering
blackguard
has
away
kept
for
a
time
and
then
dropped
there
are
many
such
young
fools
in
petersburg
in
satins
and
velvets
and
you
see
them
sweeping
the
streets
in
the
company
of
drunkards
in
rags
when
i
think
sometimes
that
dunia
too
may
end
in
the
same
way
then
in
spite
of
myself
i
sin
and
wish
her
in
her
grave
such
was
the
story
of
my
friend
the
old
postmaster
the
story
more
than
once
interrupted
by
tears
which
he
wiped
away
picturesquely
with
the
flap
of
his
coat
like
the
faithful
terentieff
in
beautiful
ballad
the
tears
were
partly
caused
by
punch
of
which
he
had
consumed
five
tumblers
in
the
course
of
his
narrative
but
whatever
their
origin
i
was
deeply
affected
by
them
after
parting
with
him
it
was
long
before
i
could
forget
the
old
postmaster
and
i
thought
long
of
poor
dunia
lately
again
passing
through
the
small
place
of
i
remembered
my
friend
i
heard
that
the
station
over
which
he
ruled
had
been
done
away
with
to
my
inquiry
is
the
postmaster
alive
no
one
could
give
a
satisfactory
answer
having
resolved
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
familiar
place
i
hired
horses
of
my
own
and
started
for
the
village
of
n
it
was
autumn
grey
clouds
covered
the
sky
a
cold
wind
blew
from
the
close
reaped
fields
carrying
with
it
the
brown
and
yellow
leaves
of
the
trees
which
it
met
i
arrived
in
the
village
at
sunset
and
stopped
at
the
station
house
in
the
passage
where
once
dunia
had
kissed
me
a
stout
woman
met
me
and
to
my
inquiries
replied
that
the
old
postmaster
had
died
about
a
year
before
that
a
brewer
occupied
his
house
and
that
she
was
the
wife
of
that
brewer
i
regretted
my
fruitless
journey
and
my
seven
roubles
of
useless
expense
of
what
did
he
die
i
asked
the
brewer
wife
of
drink
she
answered
and
where
is
he
buried
beyond
the
village
by
the
side
of
his
late
wife
could
someone
take
me
to
his
grave
certainly
hi
vanka
cease
playing
with
the
cat
and
take
this
gentleman
to
the
cemetery
and
show
him
the
postmaster
grave
at
these
words
a
ragged
boy
with
red
hair
and
a
squint
ran
towards
me
to
lead
the
way
did
you
know
the
poor
man
i
asked
him
on
the
road
how
should
i
not
know
him
he
taught
me
to
make
whistles
when
may
he
be
in
heaven
we
met
him
coming
from
the
tavern
used
to
run
after
him
calling
daddy
some
nuts
and
he
gave
us
nuts
he
idled
most
of
his
time
away
with
us
and
do
the
travellers
ever
speak
of
him
there
are
few
travellers
unless
the
assize
judge
turns
up
and
he
is
too
busy
to
think
of
the
dead
but
a
lady
passing
through
last
summer
did
ask
after
the
old
postmaster
and
she
went
to
his
grave
what
was
the
ladylike
i
inquired
curiously
a
beautiful
lady
answered
the
boy
she
travelled
in
a
coach
with
six
horses
three
beautiful
little
children
a
nurse
and
a
little
black
dog
and
when
she
heard
that
the
old
postmaster
was
dead
she
wept
and
told
the
children
to
keep
quiet
while
she
went
to
the
cemetery
i
offered
to
show
her
the
way
but
the
lady
said
know
the
way
and
she
gave
me
a
silver
twopence
such
a
kind
lady
we
reached
the
cemetery
it
was
a
bare
place
unenclosed
marked
with
wooden
crosses
and
unshaded
by
a
single
tree
never
before
had
i
seen
such
a
melancholy
cemetery
here
is
the
grave
of
the
old
postmaster
said
the
boy
to
me
as
he
pointed
to
a
heap
of
sand
into
which
had
been
stuck
a
black
cross
with
a
brass
image
did
the
lady
come
here
i
asked
she
did
replied
vanka
i
saw
her
from
a
distance
she
lay
down
here
and
remained
lying
down
for
a
long
while
then
she
went
into
the
village
and
saw
the
priest
she
gave
him
some
money
and
drove
off
to
me
she
gave
a
silver
she
was
a
splendid
lady
and
i
also
gave
the
boy
a
silver
regretting
neither
the
journey
nor
the
seven
roubles
that
it
had
cost
me
the
lady
rustic
in
one
of
our
distant
provinces
was
the
estate
of
ivan
petrovitch
berestoff
as
a
youth
he
served
in
the
guards
but
having
left
the
army
early
in
he
retired
to
his
country
seat
and
there
remained
he
married
a
wife
from
among
the
poor
nobility
and
when
she
died
in
childbed
he
happened
to
be
detained
on
farming
business
in
one
of
his
distant
fields
his
daily
occupations
soon
brought
him
consolation
he
built
a
house
on
his
own
plan
set
up
his
own
cloth
factory
became
his
own
auditor
and
accountant
and
began
to
think
himself
the
cleverest
fellow
in
the
whole
district
the
neighbours
who
used
to
come
to
him
upon
a
visit
and
bring
their
families
and
dogs
took
good
care
not
to
contradict
him
his
dress
was
a
short
coat
of
velveteen
on
holidays
he
wore
a
of
cloth
from
his
own
factory
his
accounts
took
most
of
his
time
and
he
read
nothing
but
the
on
the
whole
though
he
was
considered
proud
he
was
not
disliked
the
only
person
who
could
never
get
on
with
him
was
his
nearest
neighbour
grigori
ivanovitch
muromsky
a
true
russian
he
had
squandered
in
moscow
a
large
part
of
his
estate
and
having
lost
his
wife
as
well
as
his
money
he
had
retired
to
his
sole
remaining
property
and
there
continued
his
extragavance
but
in
a
different
way
he
set
up
an
english
garden
on
which
he
spent
nearly
all
the
income
he
had
left
his
grooms
wore
english
liveries
an
english
governess
taught
his
daughter
he
farmed
his
land
upon
the
english
system
but
foreign
farming
grows
no
russian
corn
so
in
spite
of
his
retirement
the
income
of
grigori
ivanovitch
did
not
increase
even
in
the
country
he
had
a
faculty
for
making
new
debts
but
he
was
no
fool
people
said
for
was
he
not
the
first
landowner
in
all
that
province
to
mortgage
his
property
to
the
government
a
process
then
generally
believed
to
be
one
of
great
complexity
and
risk
among
his
detractors
berestoff
a
thorough
hater
of
innovation
was
the
most
severe
in
speaking
of
his
he
could
scarcely
keep
his
feelings
under
control
and
missed
no
opportunity
for
criticism
to
some
compliment
from
a
visitor
to
his
estate
he
would
answer
with
a
knowing
smile
yes
my
farming
is
not
like
that
of
grigori
ivanovitch
i
ca
afford
to
ruin
my
land
on
the
english
system
but
i
am
satisfied
to
escape
starvation
on
the
russian
obliging
neighbours
reported
these
and
other
jokes
to
grigori
with
additions
and
commentaries
of
their
own
the
was
as
irritable
as
a
journalist
under
this
criticism
and
wrathfully
referred
to
his
critic
as
a
bumpkin
and
a
bear
relations
were
thus
strained
when
berestoff
son
came
home
having
finished
his
university
career
he
wanted
to
go
into
the
army
but
his
father
objected
for
the
civil
service
young
berestoff
had
no
taste
neither
would
yield
so
young
alexis
took
up
the
life
of
a
country
gentleman
and
to
be
ready
for
emergencies
cultivated
a
moustache
he
was
really
a
handsome
fellow
and
it
would
indeed
have
been
a
pity
never
to
pinch
his
fine
figure
into
a
military
uniform
and
instead
of
displaying
his
broad
shoulders
on
horseback
to
round
them
over
an
office
desk
ever
foremost
in
the
and
a
straight
rider
it
was
quite
clear
declared
the
neighbours
that
he
could
never
make
a
good
official
the
shy
young
ladies
glanced
and
the
bold
stared
at
him
in
admiration
but
he
took
no
notice
of
them
and
each
could
only
attribute
his
indifference
to
some
prior
attachment
in
fact
there
was
in
private
circulation
copied
from
an
envelope
in
his
handwriting
this
address
care
of
akulina
petrovna
kurotchkina
opposite
alexeieff
monastery
those
readers
who
have
not
seen
our
country
life
can
hardly
realize
the
charm
of
these
provincial
girls
breathing
pure
air
under
the
shadow
of
their
apple
trees
their
only
knowledge
of
the
world
is
drawn
from
books
in
solitude
and
unrestrained
their
feelings
and
their
passions
develop
early
to
a
degree
unknown
to
the
busier
beauties
of
our
towns
for
them
the
tinkling
of
a
bell
is
an
event
a
drive
into
the
nearest
town
an
epoch
and
a
chance
visit
a
long
sometimes
an
everlasting
remembrance
at
their
oddities
he
may
laugh
who
will
but
superficial
sneers
can
not
impair
their
real
merits
their
individuality
which
so
says
jean
paul
is
a
necessary
element
of
greatness
the
women
in
large
towns
may
be
better
educated
but
the
levelling
influence
of
the
world
soon
makes
all
women
as
much
alike
as
their
own
let
not
this
be
regarded
as
condemnation
still
as
an
ancient
writer
says
nostra
it
may
be
imagined
what
an
impression
alexis
made
on
our
country
misses
he
was
the
first
gloomy
and
disenchanted
hero
they
had
ever
beheld
the
first
who
ever
spoke
to
them
of
vanished
joys
and
blighted
past
besides
he
wore
a
black
ring
with
a
death
head
on
it
all
this
was
quite
a
new
thing
in
that
province
and
the
young
ladies
all
went
crazy
but
she
in
whose
thoughts
he
dwelt
most
deeply
was
lisa
or
as
the
old
called
her
betty
the
daughter
of
grigori
ivanovitch
their
fathers
did
not
visit
so
she
had
never
seen
alexis
who
was
the
sole
topic
of
conversation
among
her
young
neighbours
she
was
just
seventeen
with
dark
eyes
lighting
up
her
pretty
face
an
only
and
consequently
a
spoilt
child
full
of
life
and
mischief
she
was
the
delight
of
her
father
and
the
distraction
of
her
governess
miss
jackson
a
prim
spinster
in
the
forties
who
powdered
her
face
and
blackened
her
eyebrows
read
pamela
twice
a
year
drew
a
salary
of
rubles
and
was
nearly
bored
to
death
in
barbarous
russia
lisa
maid
nastia
was
older
but
quite
as
flighty
as
her
mistress
who
was
very
fond
of
her
and
had
her
as
confidante
in
all
her
secrets
and
as
in
her
mischief
in
fact
no
leading
lady
played
half
such
an
important
part
in
french
tragedy
as
was
played
by
nastia
in
the
village
said
nastia
while
dressing
her
young
lady
may
i
go
and
visit
a
friend
yes
where
to
the
berestoff
it
is
the
cook
namesday
he
called
yesterday
to
ask
us
to
dinner
then
said
lisa
the
masters
quarrel
and
the
servants
entertain
one
another
and
what
does
that
matter
to
us
said
nastia
i
belong
to
you
and
not
to
your
father
you
have
not
quarrelled
with
young
berestoff
yet
let
the
old
people
fight
if
they
please
nastia
try
and
see
alexei
berestoff
come
back
and
tell
me
all
about
him
nastia
promised
lisa
spent
the
whole
day
impatiently
waiting
for
her
in
the
evening
she
returned
well
lisaveta
grigorievna
she
said
as
she
entered
the
room
i
have
seen
young
berestoff
i
had
a
good
look
at
him
we
spent
the
whole
day
together
how
so
tell
me
all
about
it
certainly
we
started
i
and
anissia
yes
yes
i
know
what
then
i
would
rather
tell
you
in
proper
order
we
were
just
in
time
for
dinner
the
room
was
quite
full
there
were
the
zaharievskys
the
steward
wife
and
daughters
the
shlupinskys
yes
yes
and
berestoff
wait
a
bit
we
sat
down
to
dinner
the
steward
wife
had
the
seat
of
honour
i
sat
next
to
her
and
her
daughters
were
huffy
but
what
do
i
care
oh
nastia
how
tiresome
you
are
with
these
everlasting
details
how
impatient
you
are
well
then
we
rose
from
table
we
had
been
sitting
for
about
three
hours
and
it
was
a
splendid
blue
red
and
striped
creams
then
we
went
into
the
garden
to
play
at
when
the
young
gentleman
appeared
well
is
it
true
is
he
so
handsome
wonderfully
handsome
i
may
say
beautiful
tall
stately
with
a
lovely
colour
really
i
thought
his
face
was
pale
well
how
did
he
strike
you
was
he
melancholy
and
thoughtful
oh
no
i
never
saw
such
a
mad
fellow
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
join
us
at
he
played
at
it
is
impossible
no
it
very
possible
and
what
more
do
you
think
when
he
caught
any
one
he
kissed
her
of
course
you
may
tell
lies
if
you
like
nastia
as
you
please
miss
only
i
am
not
lying
i
could
scarcely
get
away
from
him
indeed
he
spent
the
whole
day
with
us
why
do
people
say
then
that
he
is
in
love
and
looks
at
nobody
i
am
sure
i
do
know
miss
he
looked
too
much
at
me
and
tania
too
the
steward
daughter
and
at
pasha
too
in
fact
he
neglected
nobody
he
is
such
a
wild
fellow
this
is
surprising
and
what
do
the
servants
say
about
him
they
say
he
is
a
splendid
gentleman
so
kind
so
lively
he
has
only
one
fault
he
is
too
fond
of
the
girls
but
i
do
think
that
is
such
a
great
fault
he
will
get
steadier
in
time
how
i
should
like
to
see
him
said
lisa
with
a
sigh
and
why
ca
you
tugilovo
is
only
a
mile
off
take
a
walk
in
that
direction
or
a
ride
and
you
are
sure
to
meet
him
he
shoulders
his
gun
and
goes
shooting
every
morning
no
it
would
never
do
he
would
think
i
was
running
after
him
besides
our
fathers
have
quarrelled
so
he
and
i
could
hardly
set
up
a
friendship
oh
nastia
i
know
what
i
do
i
will
dress
up
like
a
peasant
that
will
do
put
on
a
coarse
chemise
and
a
and
set
out
boldly
for
tugilovo
berestoff
will
never
miss
you
i
promise
you
i
can
talk
like
a
peasant
splendidly
oh
nastia
dear
nastia
what
a
happy
thought
and
lisa
went
to
bed
resolved
to
carry
out
her
plan
next
day
she
made
her
preparations
she
went
to
the
market
for
some
coarse
linen
some
dark
blue
stuff
and
some
brass
buttons
and
out
of
these
nastia
and
she
cut
a
chemise
and
a
all
the
were
set
down
to
sew
and
by
evening
everything
was
ready
as
she
tried
on
her
new
costume
before
the
glass
lisa
said
to
herself
that
she
had
never
looked
so
nice
then
she
began
to
rehearse
her
meeting
with
alexis
first
she
gave
him
a
low
bow
as
she
passed
along
then
she
continued
to
nod
her
head
like
a
mandarin
next
she
addressed
him
in
a
peasant
simpering
and
shyly
hiding
her
face
behind
her
sleeve
nastia
gave
the
performance
her
full
approval
but
there
was
one
difficulty
she
tried
to
cross
the
yard
barefooted
but
the
grass
stalks
pricked
her
tender
feet
and
the
gravel
caused
intolerable
pain
nastia
again
came
to
the
rescue
she
took
the
measure
of
lisa
foot
and
hurried
across
the
fields
to
the
herdsman
trophim
of
whom
she
ordered
a
pair
of
bark
shoes
the
next
morning
before
daylight
lisa
awoke
the
whole
household
was
still
asleep
nastia
was
at
the
gate
waiting
for
the
herdsman
soon
the
sound
of
his
horn
drew
near
and
the
village
herd
straggled
past
the
manor
gates
after
them
came
trophim
who
as
he
passed
handed
to
nastia
a
little
pair
of
speckled
bark
shoes
and
received
a
ruble
lisa
who
had
quietly
donned
her
peasant
dress
whispered
to
nastia
her
last
instructions
about
miss
jackson
then
she
went
through
the
kitchen
out
of
the
back
door
into
the
open
field
then
she
began
to
run
dawn
was
breaking
and
the
rows
of
golden
clouds
stood
like
courtiers
waiting
for
their
monarch
the
clear
sky
the
fresh
morning
air
the
dew
the
breeze
and
singing
of
the
birds
filled
lisa
heart
with
joy
fearing
to
meet
with
some
acquaintance
she
did
nor
walk
but
flew
as
she
drew
near
the
wood
where
lay
the
boundary
of
her
father
property
she
slackened
her
pace
it
was
here
she
was
to
meet
alexis
her
heart
beat
violently
she
knew
not
why
the
terrors
of
our
youthful
escapades
are
their
chief
charm
lisa
stepped
forward
into
the
darkness
of
the
wood
its
hollow
echoes
bade
her
welcome
her
buoyant
spirits
gradually
gave
place
to
meditation
she
thought
but
who
shall
truly
tell
the
thoughts
of
sweet
seventeen
in
a
wood
alone
at
six
on
a
spring
morning
and
as
she
walked
in
meditation
under
the
shade
of
lofty
trees
suddenly
a
beautiful
pointer
began
to
bark
at
her
lisa
cried
out
with
fear
and
at
the
same
moment
a
voice
exclaimed
beau
shogar
ici
and
a
young
sportsman
stepped
from
behind
the
bushes
do
be
afraid
my
dear
he
wo
bite
lisa
had
already
recovered
from
her
fright
and
instantly
took
advantage
of
the
situation
it
all
very
well
sir
she
said
with
assumed
timidity
and
shyness
am
afraid
of
him
he
seems
such
a
savage
creature
and
may
fly
at
me
again
alexis
whom
the
reader
has
already
recognised
looked
steadily
at
the
young
peasant
i
will
escort
you
if
you
are
afraid
will
you
allow
me
to
walk
by
your
side
who
is
to
prevent
you
replied
lisa
a
freeman
can
do
as
he
likes
and
the
road
is
public
where
do
you
come
from
from
prilutchina
i
am
the
daughter
of
yassili
the
blacksmith
and
i
am
looking
for
mushrooms
she
was
carrying
a
basket
suspended
from
her
shoulders
by
a
cord
and
you
are
you
from
tugilovo
exactly
i
am
the
young
gentleman
valet
he
wished
to
equalize
their
ranks
but
lisa
looked
at
him
and
laughed
ah
you
are
lying
she
said
i
am
not
a
fool
i
see
you
are
the
master
himself
what
makes
you
think
so
everything
still
how
can
one
help
it
you
are
not
dressed
like
a
servant
you
speak
differently
you
even
call
your
dog
in
a
foreign
tongue
lisa
charmed
him
more
and
more
every
moment
accustomed
to
be
unceremonious
with
pretty
country
girls
he
tried
to
kiss
her
but
lisa
jumped
aside
and
suddenly
assumed
so
distant
and
severe
an
air
that
though
it
amused
him
he
did
not
attempt
any
further
familiarities
if
you
wish
to
remain
friends
she
said
with
dignity
do
not
forget
yourself
who
has
taught
you
this
wisdom
asked
alexis
with
a
laugh
can
it
be
my
little
friend
nastia
your
mistress
maid
so
this
is
how
civilization
spreads
lisa
felt
she
had
almost
betrayed
herself
and
said
do
you
think
i
have
never
been
up
to
the
manor
house
i
have
seen
and
heard
more
than
you
think
still
chattering
here
with
you
wo
get
me
mushrooms
you
go
that
way
i
go
the
other
begging
your
pardon
and
lisa
made
as
if
to
depart
but
alexis
held
her
by
the
hand
what
is
your
name
my
dear
akulina
she
said
struggling
to
get
her
fingers
free
let
me
go
it
is
time
for
me
to
be
home
well
my
friend
akulina
i
shall
certainly
call
on
your
father
yassili
the
blacksmith
for
the
lord
sake
do
do
that
if
they
knew
at
home
i
had
been
talking
here
alone
with
the
young
i
should
catch
it
my
father
would
beat
me
within
an
inch
of
my
life
well
i
must
see
you
again
i
will
come
again
some
other
day
for
mushrooms
when
if
you
like
my
dear
akulina
i
would
kiss
you
if
i
dared
then
at
the
same
time
that
is
a
bargain
all
right
you
will
not
play
me
false
no
swear
it
by
the
holy
friday
then
i
will
come
the
young
couple
parted
lisa
ran
out
of
the
wood
across
the
fields
stole
into
the
garden
and
rushed
headlong
into
the
farmyard
where
nastia
was
waiting
for
her
then
she
changed
her
dress
answering
at
random
the
impatient
questions
of
her
and
went
into
the
to
find
the
cloth
laid
and
breakfast
ready
miss
jackson
freshly
powdered
and
jaced
until
she
looked
like
a
wine
glass
was
cutting
thin
slices
of
bread
and
butter
her
father
complimented
lisa
on
her
early
walk
there
is
no
healthier
habit
he
remarked
than
to
rise
at
daybreak
he
quoted
from
the
english
papers
several
cases
of
longevity
adding
that
all
centenarians
had
abstained
from
spirits
and
made
it
a
practice
to
rise
at
daybreak
winter
and
summer
lisa
did
not
prove
an
attentive
listener
she
was
repeating
in
her
mind
the
details
of
her
morning
interview
and
as
she
recalled
akulina
conversation
with
the
young
sportsman
her
conscience
smote
her
in
vain
she
assured
herself
that
the
bounds
of
decorum
had
not
been
passed
this
joke
she
argued
could
have
no
evil
consequences
but
conscience
would
not
be
quieted
what
most
disturbed
her
was
her
promise
to
repeat
the
meeting
she
half
decided
not
to
keep
her
word
but
then
alexis
tired
of
waiting
might
go
to
seek
the
blacksmiths
daughter
in
the
village
and
find
the
real
akulina
a
stout
pockmarked
girl
and
so
discover
the
hoax
alarmed
at
this
she
determined
to
the
part
of
akulina
alexis
was
enchanted
all
day
he
thought
about
his
new
acquaintance
and
at
night
he
dreamt
of
her
it
was
scarcely
dawn
when
he
was
up
and
dressed
without
waiting
even
to
load
his
gun
he
set
out
followed
by
the
faithful
shogar
and
ran
to
the
meeting
place
half
an
hour
passed
in
undeniable
delay
at
last
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
blue
among
the
bushes
and
rushed
to
meet
dear
akulina
she
smiled
to
see
his
eagerness
but
he
saw
traces
of
anxiety
and
melancholy
on
her
face
he
asked
her
the
cause
and
she
at
last
confessed
she
had
been
flighty
and
was
very
sorry
for
it
she
had
meant
not
to
keep
her
promise
and
this
meeting
at
any
rate
must
be
the
last
she
begged
him
not
to
seek
to
continue
an
acquaintance
which
could
have
no
good
end
all
this
of
course
was
said
in
peasant
dialect
but
the
thought
and
feeling
struck
alexis
as
unusual
in
a
peasant
in
eloquent
words
he
urged
her
to
abandon
this
cruel
resolution
she
should
have
no
reason
for
repentance
he
would
obey
her
in
everything
if
only
she
would
not
rob
him
of
his
one
happiness
and
let
him
see
her
alone
three
times
or
even
only
twice
a
week
he
spoke
with
passion
and
at
the
moment
he
was
really
in
love
lisa
listened
to
him
in
silence
promise
she
said
to
seek
no
other
meetings
with
me
but
those
which
i
myself
appoint
he
was
about
to
swear
by
the
holy
friday
when
she
stopped
him
with
a
smile
i
do
not
want
you
to
swear
your
word
is
enough
then
together
they
wandered
talking
in
the
wood
till
lisa
said
it
is
time
they
parted
and
alexis
was
left
to
wonder
how
in
two
meetings
a
simple
rustic
had
gained
such
influence
over
him
there
was
a
freshness
and
novelty
about
it
all
that
charmed
him
and
though
the
conditions
she
imposed
were
irksome
the
thought
of
breaking
his
promise
never
even
entered
his
mind
after
all
in
spite
of
his
fatal
ring
and
the
mysterious
correspondence
alexis
was
a
kind
and
affectionate
youth
with
a
pure
heart
still
capable
of
innocent
enjoyment
did
i
consult
only
my
own
wishes
i
should
dwell
at
length
on
the
meetings
of
these
young
people
their
growing
love
their
mutual
trust
and
all
they
did
and
all
they
said
but
my
pleasure
i
know
would
not
be
shared
by
the
majority
of
my
readers
so
for
their
sake
i
will
omit
them
i
will
only
say
that
in
a
brief
two
months
alexis
was
already
madly
in
love
and
lisa
though
more
reticent
than
he
was
not
indifferent
happy
in
the
present
they
took
little
thought
for
the
future
visions
of
indissoluble
ties
flitted
not
seldom
through
the
minds
of
both
but
neither
mentioned
them
for
alexis
however
strong
his
attachment
to
akulina
could
not
forget
the
social
distance
that
was
between
them
while
lisa
knowing
the
enmity
between
their
fathers
dared
not
count
on
their
becoming
reconciled
besides
her
vanity
was
stimulated
by
the
vague
romantic
hope
of
at
last
seeing
the
lord
of
tugilovo
at
the
feet
of
the
daughter
of
a
village
blacksmith
suddenly
something
happened
which
came
near
to
change
the
course
of
their
true
love
one
of
those
cold
bright
mornings
so
common
in
our
russian
autumns
ivan
berestoff
came
for
all
emergencies
he
brought
with
him
six
pointers
and
a
dozen
beaters
that
same
morning
grigori
muromsky
tempted
by
the
fine
weather
saddled
his
english
mare
and
came
trotting
through
his
agricultural
estates
nearing
the
wood
he
came
upon
his
neighbour
proudly
seated
in
the
saddle
wearing
his
overcoat
ivan
berestoff
was
waiting
for
the
hare
which
the
beaters
were
driving
with
discordant
noises
out
of
the
brushwood
if
muromsky
could
have
foreseen
this
meeting
he
would
have
avoided
it
but
finding
himself
suddenly
within
there
was
no
escape
like
a
cultivated
european
gentleman
muromsky
rode
up
to
and
addressed
his
enemy
politely
berestoff
answered
with
the
grace
of
a
chained
bear
dancing
to
the
order
of
his
keeper
at
this
moment
out
shot
the
hare
and
scudded
across
the
field
berestoff
and
his
groom
shouted
to
loose
the
dogs
and
started
after
them
full
speed
muromsky
mare
took
fright
and
bolted
her
rider
who
often
boasted
of
his
horsemanship
gave
her
her
head
and
chuckled
inwardly
over
this
opportunity
of
escaping
a
disagreeable
companion
but
the
mare
coming
at
a
gallop
to
an
unseen
ditch
swerved
muromsky
lost
his
seat
fell
rather
heavily
on
the
frozen
ground
and
lay
there
cursing
the
animal
which
sobered
by
the
loss
of
her
master
stopped
at
once
berestoff
galloped
to
the
rescue
asking
if
muromsky
was
hurt
meanwhile
the
groom
led
up
the
culprit
by
the
bridle
berestoff
helped
muromsky
into
the
saddle
and
then
invited
him
to
his
house
peeling
himself
under
an
obligation
muromsky
could
not
refuse
and
so
berestoff
returned
in
glory
having
killed
the
hare
and
bringing
home
with
him
his
adversary
wounded
and
almost
a
prisoner
of
war
at
breakfast
the
neighbours
fell
into
rather
friendly
conversation
muromsky
asked
berestoff
to
lend
him
a
droshky
confessing
that
his
fall
made
it
too
painful
for
him
to
ride
back
berestoff
accompanied
him
to
the
outer
gate
and
before
the
leavetaking
was
over
muromsky
pad
obtained
from
him
a
promise
to
come
and
bring
alexis
to
a
friendly
dinner
at
prelutchina
next
day
so
this
old
enmity
which
seemed
before
so
deeply
rooted
was
on
the
point
of
ending
because
the
little
mare
had
taken
fright
lisa
ran
to
meet
per
father
on
his
return
what
has
happened
papa
she
asked
in
astonishment
why
are
you
limping
where
is
the
mare
whose
droshki
is
this
my
dear
you
will
never
guess
and
then
he
told
per
lisa
could
not
believe
per
ears
before
she
pad
time
to
collect
herself
she
heard
that
both
the
berestoffs
would
come
to
dinner
what
do
you
say
she
exclaimed
turning
pale
the
berestoffs
father
and
son
dine
with
us
no
papa
you
can
do
as
you
please
i
certainly
do
not
appear
why
are
you
mad
since
when
have
you
become
so
shy
have
you
imbibed
hereditary
hatred
like
a
heroine
of
romance
come
do
be
afoot
no
papa
nothing
on
earth
shall
induce
me
to
meet
the
berestoffs
her
father
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
left
off
arguing
he
knew
he
could
not
prevail
with
her
by
opposition
so
he
went
to
bed
after
his
memorable
ride
lisa
too
went
to
her
room
and
summoned
nastia
long
did
they
discuss
the
coming
visit
what
will
alexis
think
on
recognising
in
the
cultivated
young
lady
his
akulina
what
opinion
will
he
form
as
to
her
behaviour
and
her
sense
on
the
other
hand
lisa
was
very
curious
to
see
how
such
an
unexpected
meeting
would
affect
him
then
an
idea
struck
her
she
told
it
to
nastia
and
with
rejoicing
they
determined
to
carry
it
into
effect
next
morning
at
breakfast
muromsky
asked
his
daughter
whether
she
still
meant
to
hide
from
the
berestoffs
papa
she
answered
i
will
receive
them
if
you
wish
it
on
one
condition
however
i
may
appear
before
them
whatever
i
may
do
you
must
promise
me
not
to
be
angry
and
you
must
show
no
surprise
or
disapproval
at
your
tricks
again
exclaimed
muromsky
laughing
well
well
i
consent
do
as
you
please
my
mischief
with
these
words
he
kissed
her
forehead
and
lisa
ran
off
to
make
her
preparations
punctually
at
two
six
horses
drawing
the
carriage
drove
into
the
courtyard
and
skirted
the
circle
of
green
turf
that
formed
its
centre
old
berestoff
helped
by
two
of
muromsky
servants
in
livery
mounted
the
steps
his
son
followed
immediately
on
horseback
and
the
two
together
entered
the
where
the
table
was
already
laid
muromsky
gave
his
guests
a
cordial
welcome
and
proposing
a
tour
of
inspection
of
the
garden
and
live
stock
before
dinner
led
them
along
his
gravel
paths
old
berestoff
secretly
deplored
the
time
and
trouble
wasted
on
such
a
useless
whim
as
this
but
politeness
forbade
him
to
express
his
feelings
his
son
shared
neither
the
disapproval
of
the
careful
farmer
nor
the
enthusiasm
of
the
complacent
he
impatiently
awaited
the
appearance
of
his
hosts
daughter
of
whom
he
had
often
heard
for
though
his
heart
as
we
know
was
no
longer
free
a
young
and
unknown
beauty
might
still
claim
his
interest
when
they
had
come
back
and
were
all
seated
in
the
the
old
men
talked
over
bygone
days
the
stories
of
the
while
alexis
considered
what
attitude
he
should
assume
towards
lisa
he
decided
upon
a
cold
preoccupation
as
most
suitable
and
arranged
accordingly
the
door
opened
he
turned
his
head
round
with
indifference
with
such
proud
indifference
that
the
heart
of
the
most
hardened
coquette
must
have
quivered
unfortunately
there
came
in
not
lisa
but
elderly
miss
jackson
whitened
laced
in
with
downcast
eyes
and
her
little
curtsey
and
alexis
magnificent
military
movement
failed
before
he
could
reassemble
his
scattered
forces
the
door
opened
again
and
this
time
entered
lisa
all
rose
muromsky
began
the
introductions
but
suddenly
stopped
and
bit
his
lip
lisa
his
dark
lisa
was
painted
white
up
to
her
ears
and
pencilled
worse
than
miss
jackson
herself
she
wore
false
fair
ringlets
puffed
out
like
a
louis
xiv
wig
her
sleeves
extended
like
the
hoops
of
madame
de
pompadour
her
figure
was
laced
in
like
a
letter
x
and
all
those
of
her
mother
diamonds
which
had
escaped
the
pawnbroker
sparkled
on
her
fingers
neck
and
ears
alexis
could
not
discover
in
this
ridiculous
young
lady
his
akulina
his
father
kissed
her
hand
and
he
much
to
his
annoyance
had
to
do
the
same
as
he
touched
her
little
white
fingers
they
seemed
to
tremble
he
noticed
too
a
tiny
foot
intentionally
displayed
and
shod
in
the
most
coquettish
of
shoes
this
reconciled
him
a
little
to
the
rest
of
her
attire
the
white
paint
and
black
pencilling
to
tell
the
truth
in
his
simplicity
he
did
not
notice
at
first
nor
indeed
afterwards
grigori
muromsky
remembering
his
promise
tried
not
to
show
surprise
for
the
rest
he
was
so
much
amused
at
his
daughter
mischief
that
he
could
scarcely
keep
his
countenance
for
the
prim
englishwoman
however
it
was
no
laughing
matter
she
guessed
that
the
white
and
black
paint
had
been
abstracted
from
her
drawer
and
a
red
patch
of
indignation
shone
through
the
artificial
whiteness
of
her
face
flaming
glances
shot
from
her
eyes
at
the
young
rogue
who
reserving
all
explanation
for
the
future
pretended
not
to
notice
them
they
sat
down
to
table
alexis
continuing
his
performance
as
an
pensive
man
lisa
was
all
affectation
she
minced
her
words
drawled
and
would
speak
only
in
french
her
father
glanced
at
her
from
time
to
time
unable
to
divine
her
object
but
he
thought
it
all
a
great
joke
the
englishwoman
fumed
but
said
nothing
ivan
berestoff
alone
felt
at
his
ease
he
ate
for
two
drank
his
fill
and
as
the
meal
went
on
became
more
and
more
friendly
and
laughed
louder
and
louder
at
last
they
rose
from
the
table
the
guests
departed
and
muromsky
gave
vent
to
his
mirth
and
curiosity
what
made
you
play
such
tricks
upon
them
he
inquired
do
you
know
lisa
that
white
paint
really
becomes
you
i
do
not
wish
to
pry
into
the
secrets
of
a
lady
toilet
but
if
i
were
you
i
should
always
paint
not
too
much
of
course
but
a
little
lisa
was
delighted
with
her
success
she
kissed
her
father
promised
to
consider
his
suggestion
and
ran
off
to
propitiate
the
enraged
miss
jackson
whom
she
could
scarcely
prevail
upon
to
open
the
door
and
hear
her
excuses
lisa
was
ashamed
she
said
to
show
herself
before
the
visitors
such
a
blackamoor
she
had
not
dared
to
ask
she
knew
dear
kind
miss
jackson
would
forgive
her
miss
jackson
persuaded
that
her
pupil
had
not
meant
to
ridicule
her
became
pacified
kissed
lisa
and
in
token
of
forgiveness
presented
her
with
a
little
pot
of
english
white
which
the
latter
with
expressions
of
deep
gratitude
accepted
next
morning
as
the
reader
will
have
guessed
lisa
hastened
to
the
meeting
in
the
wood
you
were
yesterday
at
our
master
sir
she
began
to
alexis
what
did
you
think
of
our
young
lady
alexis
answered
that
he
had
not
observed
her
that
is
a
pity
why
because
i
wanted
to
ask
you
if
what
they
say
is
true
what
do
they
say
that
i
resemble
our
young
lady
do
you
think
so
what
nonsense
she
is
a
deformity
beside
you
oh
it
is
a
sin
of
you
to
say
so
our
young
lady
is
so
fair
so
elegant
how
can
i
vie
with
her
alexis
vowed
that
she
was
prettier
than
all
imaginable
fair
young
ladies
and
to
appease
her
thoroughly
began
describing
her
young
lady
so
funnily
that
lisa
burst
into
a
hearty
laugh
still
she
said
with
a
sigh
though
she
may
be
ridiculous
yet
by
her
side
i
am
an
illiterate
fool
well
that
a
thing
to
worry
yourself
about
if
you
like
i
will
teach
you
to
read
at
once
are
you
in
earnest
shall
i
really
try
if
you
like
my
darling
we
will
begin
at
once
they
sat
down
alexis
produced
a
pencil
and
and
akulina
proved
astonishingly
quick
in
learning
the
alphabet
alexis
wondered
at
her
intelligence
at
their
next
meeting
she
wished
to
learn
to
write
the
pencil
at
first
would
not
obey
her
but
in
a
few
minutes
she
could
trace
the
letters
pretty
well
how
wonderfully
we
get
on
faster
than
by
the
lancaster
method
indeed
at
the
third
lesson
akulina
could
read
words
of
even
three
syllables
and
the
intelligent
remarks
with
which
she
interrupted
the
lessons
fairly
astonished
alexis
as
for
writing
she
covered
a
whole
page
with
aphorisms
taken
from
the
story
she
had
been
reading
a
week
passed
and
they
had
begun
a
correspondence
their
was
the
trunk
of
an
old
oak
and
nastia
secretly
played
the
part
of
postman
thither
alexis
would
bring
his
letters
written
in
a
large
round
hand
and
there
he
found
the
letters
of
his
beloved
scrawled
on
coarse
blue
paper
akulina
style
was
evidently
improving
and
her
mind
clearly
was
developing
under
cultivation
meanwhile
the
acquaintance
between
berestoff
and
muromsky
grew
stronger
soon
it
became
friendship
muromsky
often
reflected
that
on
the
death
of
old
berestoff
his
property
would
come
to
alexis
who
would
then
be
one
of
the
richest
landowners
in
that
province
why
should
he
not
marry
lisa
old
berestoff
on
the
other
hand
though
he
looked
on
his
neighbour
as
a
lunatic
did
not
deny
that
he
possessed
many
excellent
qualities
among
them
a
certain
cleverness
muromsky
was
related
to
count
pronsky
a
distinguished
and
influential
man
the
count
might
be
very
useful
to
alexis
and
muromsky
so
thought
berestoff
would
probably
be
glad
to
marry
his
daughter
so
well
both
the
old
men
pondered
all
this
so
thoroughly
that
at
last
they
broached
the
subject
confabulated
embraced
and
severally
began
a
plan
of
campaign
muromsky
foresaw
one
difficulty
how
to
persuade
his
betty
to
make
the
better
acquaintance
of
alexis
whom
she
had
never
seen
since
the
memorable
dinner
they
hardly
seemed
to
suit
each
other
well
at
any
rate
alexis
had
not
renewed
his
visit
to
prelutchina
whenever
old
berestoff
called
lisa
made
a
point
of
retreating
to
her
own
room
but
thought
muromsky
if
alexis
called
every
day
betty
could
not
help
falling
in
love
with
him
that
is
the
way
to
manage
it
time
will
settle
everything
berestoff
troubled
himself
less
about
his
plans
that
same
evening
he
called
his
son
into
his
study
lit
his
pipe
and
after
a
short
silence
began
you
have
not
spoken
about
the
army
lately
alexis
has
the
hussar
uniform
lost
its
attraction
for
you
no
father
he
replied
respectfully
i
know
you
do
not
wish
me
to
join
the
hussars
it
is
my
duty
to
consult
your
wishes
i
am
pleased
to
find
you
such
an
obedient
son
still
i
do
not
wish
to
force
your
inclinations
i
will
not
insist
upon

alexis
knew
that
when
his
father
took
a
thing
into
his
head
nothing
could
knock
it
out
again
but
then
alexis
was
as
obstinate
as
his
father
he
went
to
his
room
and
there
reflected
upon
the
limits
of
parental
authority
on
lisa
muromskaia
his
father
threat
to
make
him
a
beggar
and
finally
he
thought
of
akulina
for
the
first
time
he
clearly
saw
how
much
he
loved
her
the
romantic
idea
of
marrying
a
peasant
girl
and
working
for
a
living
came
into
his
mind
and
the
more
he
thought
of
it
the
more
he
approved
it
their
meetings
in
the
wood
had
been
stopped
of
late
by
the
wet
weather
he
wrote
to
akulina
in
the
roundest
hand
and
the
maddest
style
telling
her
of
his
impending
ruin
and
asking
her
to
be
his
wife
he
took
the
letter
at
once
to
the
tree
trunk
dropped
it
in
and
went
much
satisfied
with
himself
to
bed
next
morning
firm
in
resolution
he
started
early
to
call
on
muromsky
and
explain
the
situation
he
meant
to
win
him
over
by
appealing
to
his
generosity
is
muromsky
at
home
he
asked
reining
up
his
horse
at
the
porch
no
sir
muromsky
went
out
early
this
morning
how
provoking
thought
alexis
well
is
miss
lisa
at
home
yes
sir
and
throwing
the
reins
to
the
footman
alexis
leapt
from
his
horse
and
entered
unannounced
it
will
soon
be
over
he
thought
going
towards
the
i
will
explain
to
miss
muromsky
herself
he
entered
and
was
transfixed
lisa
no
akulina
dear
dark
akulina
wearing
no
but
a
white
morning
frock
sat
by
the
window
reading
his
letter
so
intent
was
she
upon
it
that
she
did
not
hear
him
enter
alexis
could
not
repress
a
cry
of
delight
lisa
started
raised
her
hand
cried
out
and
attempted
to
run
away
he
rushed
to
stop
her
akulina
akulina
lisa
tried
to
free
herself
laissez
moi
donc
monsieur
mais
√™tes
vous
fou
she
repeated
turning
away
akulina
my
darling
akulina
he
repeated
kissing
her
hand
miss
jackson
who
was
an
of
this
scene
knew
not
what
to
think
the
door
opened
and
grigori
muromsky
entered
ah
cried
he
you
seem
to
have
settled
things
between
the
reader
will
excuse
me
the
unnecessary
trouble
of
winding
up
kirdjali
kirdjali
was
by
birth
a
bulgarian
kirdjali
in
turkish
means
a
bold
fellow
a
kirdjali
with
his
depredations
brought
terror
upon
the
whole
of
moldavia
to
give
some
idea
of
him
i
will
relate
one
of
his
exploits
one
night
he
and
the
arnout
michailaki
fell
together
upon
a
bulgarian
village
they
set
fire
to
it
from
both
ends
and
went
from
hut
to
hut
kirdjali
killing
while
michailaki
carried
off
the
plunder
both
cried
kirdjali
kirdjali
and
the
whole
village
ran
when
alexander
ipsilanti
proclaimed
the
insurrection
and
began
raising
his
army
kirdjali
brought
him
several
of
his
old
followers
they
knew
little
of
the
real
object
of
the
but
war
presented
an
opportunity
for
getting
rich
at
the
expense
of
the
turks
and
perhaps
of
the
moldavians
too
alexander
ipsilanti
was
personally
brave
but
he
was
wanting
in
the
qualities
necessary
for
playing
the
part
he
had
with
such
eager
recklessness
assumed
he
did
not
know
how
to
manage
the
people
under
his
command
they
had
neither
respect
for
him
nor
confidence
after
the
unfortunate
battle
when
the
flower
of
greek
youth
fell
jordaki
olimbisti
advised
him
to
retire
and
himself
took
his
place
ipsilanti
escaped
to
the
frontiers
of
austria
whence
he
sent
his
curse
to
the
people
whom
he
now
stigmatised
as
mutineers
cowards
and
blackguards
these
cowards
and
blackguards
mostly
perished
within
the
walls
of
the
monastery
of
seke
or
on
the
banks
of
the
pruth
defending
themselves
desperately
against
a
foe
ten
times
their
number
kirdjali
belonged
to
the
detachment
commanded
by
george
cantacuz√®ne
of
whom
might
be
repeated
what
has
already
been
said
of
ipsilanti
on
the
eve
of
the
battle
near
skuliana
cantacuz√®ne
asked
permission
of
the
russian
authorities
to
enter
their
quarters
the
band
was
left
without
a
commander
but
kirdjali
sophianos
cantagoni
and
others
had
no
need
of
a
commander
the
battle
of
skuliana
seems
not
to
have
been
described
by
any
one
in
all
its
pathetic
truth
just
imagine
seven
hundred
arnouts
albanians
greeks
bulgarians
and
every
kind
of
rabble
with
no
notion
of
military
art
retreating
within
sight
of
fifteen
thousand
turkish
cavalry
the
band
kept
close
to
the
banks
of
the
pruth
placing
in
front
two
tiny
cannons
found
at
jassy
in
the
courtyard
of
the
hospodar
and
which
had
formerly
been
used
for
firing
salutes
on
festive
occasions
the
turks
would
have
been
glad
to
use
their
cartridges
but
dared
not
without
permission
from
the
russian
authorities
for
the
shots
would
have
been
sure
to
fly
over
to
our
banks
the
commander
of
the
russian
military
post
now
dead
though
he
had
been
forty
years
in
the
army
had
never
heard
the
whistle
of
a
bullet
but
he
was
fated
to
hear
it
now
several
bullets
buzzed
passed
his
ears
the
old
man
got
very
angry
and
began
to
swear
at
ohotsky
major
of
one
of
the
infantry
battalions
the
major
not
knowing
what
to
do
ran
towards
the
river
on
the
other
side
of
which
some
insurgent
cavalry
were
capering
about
he
shook
his
finger
at
them
on
which
they
turned
round
and
galloped
along
with
the
whole
turkish
army
after
them
the
major
who
had
shaken
his
finger
was
called
hortchevsky
i
do
know
what
became
of
him
the
next
day
however
the
turks
attacked
the
arnouts
hot
daring
to
use
cartridges
or
cannon
balls
they
resolved
contrary
to
their
custom
to
employ
cold
steel
the
battle
was
fierce
the
combatants
slashed
and
stabbed
one
another
the
turks
were
seen
with
lances
which
hitherto
they
had
never
possessed
and
these
lances
were
russian
our
nekrassoff
refugees
were
fighting
in
their
ranks
the
thanks
to
the
permission
of
our
emperor
were
allowed
to
cross
the
pruth
and
seek
the
protection
of
our
garrison
they
began
to
cross
the
river
cantagoni
and
sophianos
being
the
last
to
quit
the
turkish
bank
kirdjali
wounded
the
day
before
was
already
lying
in
russian
quarters
sophianos
was
killed
cantagoni
a
very
stout
man
was
wounded
with
a
spear
in
his
stomach
with
one
hand
he
raised
his
sword
with
the
other
he
seized
the
enemy
spear
pushed
it
deeper
into
himself
and
by
that
means
was
able
to
reach
his
murderer
with
his
own
sword
when
they
fell
together
all
was
over
the
turks
remained
victorious
moldavia
was
cleared
of
insurgents
about
six
hundred
arnouts
were
scattered
over
bessarabia
unable
to
obtain
the
means
of
subsistence
they
still
felt
grateful
to
russia
for
her
protection
they
led
an
idle
though
not
a
dissolute
life
they
could
be
seen
in
of
half
turkish
bessarabia
with
long
pipes
in
their
mouths
sipping
thick
coffee
out
of
small
cups
their
figured
zouave
jackets
and
red
slippers
with
pointed
toes
were
beginning
to
look
shabby
but
they
still
wore
their
tufted
on
one
side
of
the
head
and
daggers
and
pistols
still
protruded
from
beneath
their
broad
girdles
no
one
complained
of
them
it
was
impossible
to
imagine
that
these
poor
peaceable
fellows
were
the
celebrated
pikemen
of
moldavia
the
followers
of
the
ferocious
kirdjali
and
that
he
himself
had
been
one
of
them
the
pasha
governing
jassy
heard
of
all
this
and
on
the
basis
of
treaty
rights
requested
the
russian
authorities
to
deliver
up
the
brigand
the
police
made
inquiries
and
found
that
kirdjali
really
was
at
kishineff
they
captured
him
in
the
house
of
a
runaway
monk
in
the
evening
while
he
was
at
supper
sitting
in
the
twilight
with
seven
comrades
kirdjali
was
arraigned
he
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
the
truth
he
owned
he
was
kirdjali
but
he
added
since
i
crossed
the
pruth
i
have
not
touched
a
hair
of
property
that
did
not
belong
to
me
nor
have
i
cheated
the
meanest
gipsy
to
the
turks
the
moldavians
and
the
walachians
i
am
certainly
a
brigand
but
to
the
russians
a
guest
when
sophianos
after
exhausting
all
his
cartridges
came
over
here
he
collected
buttons
from
the
uniforms
nails
and
nobs
from
the
daggers
for
the
final
discharge
and
i
myself
handed
him
twenty
to
fire
off
leaving
myself
without
money
god
is
my
witness
that
i
kirdjali
lived
by
charity
why
then
do
the
russians
now
hand
me
over
to
my
enemies
after
that
kirdjali
was
silent
and
quietly
awaited
his
fate
it
was
soon
announced
to
him
the
authorities
not
thinking
themselves
hound
to
look
upon
brigandage
from
its
romantic
side
and
admitting
the
justice
of
the
turkish
demand
ordered
kirdjali
to
be
given
up
that
he
might
be
sent
to
jassy
a
man
of
brains
and
feeling
at
that
time
young
and
unknown
but
now
occupying
an
important
post
gave
me
a
graphic
description
of
kirdjali
departure
at
the
gates
of
the
prison
he
said
stood
a
hired
perhaps
you
do
know
what
a
is
it
is
a
low
to
which
quite
recently
used
to
be
harnessed
six
or
eight
miserable
screws
a
moldavian
with
a
moustache
and
a
sheepskin
hat
sitting
astride
one
of
the
horses
cried
out
and
cracked
his
whip
every
moment
and
his
wretched
little
beasts
went
on
at
a
sharp
trot
if
one
of
them
began
to
lag
then
he
unharnessed
it
with
terrific
cursing
and
left
it
on
the
road
not
caring
what
became
of
it
on
the
return
journey
he
was
sure
to
find
them
in
the
same
place
calmly
grazing
on
the
steppes
frequently
a
traveller
starting
from
a
station
with
eight
horses
would
arrive
at
the
next
with
a
pair
only
it
was
so
about
fifteen
years
ago
now
in
russianized
bessarabia
russian
harness
and
russian
carts
have
been
adopted
such
a
as
i
have
described
stood
at
the
gate
of
the
jail
in
towards
the
end
of
september
jewesses
with
their
sleeves
hanging
down
and
with
flapping
slippers
arnouts
in
ragged
but
picturesque
costumes
stately
moldavian
women
with
children
in
their
arms
surrounded
the
the
men
maintained
silence
the
women
were
excited
as
if
expecting
something
to
happen
the
gates
opened
and
several
police
officers
stepped
into
the
street
followed
by
two
soldiers
leading
kirdjali
in
chains
he
looked
about
thirty
the
features
of
his
dark
face
were
regular
and
austere
he
was
tall
and
seemed
to
possess
great
physical
strength
he
wore
a
variegated
turban
on
the
side
of
his
head
and
a
broad
sash
round
his
slender
waist
a
dolman
of
thick
dark
blue
cloth
the
wide
plaits
of
his
falling
just
above
the
knees
and
a
pair
of
handsome
slippers
completed
his
dress
his
bearing
was
calm
and
haughty
one
of
the
officials
a
old
man
in
a
faded
uniform
with
three
buttons
hanging
loose
a
pair
of
lead
spectacles
which
pinched
a
crimson
knob
doing
duty
for
a
nose
unrolled
a
paper
and
stooping
began
to
read
in
the
moldavian
tongue
from
time
to
time
he
glanced
haughtily
at
the
handcuffed
kirdjali
to
whom
apparently
the
document
referred
kirdjali
listened
attentively
the
official
finished
his
reading
folded
the
paper
and
called
out
sternly
to
the
people
ordering
them
to
make
way
for
the
to
drive
up
then
kirdjali
turning
towards
him
said
a
few
words
in
moldavian
his
voice
trembled
his
countenance
changed
he
burst
into
tears
and
fell
at
the
feet
of
the
police
officer
with
a
clanking
of
his
chains
the
police
officer
in
alarm
started
back
the
soldiers
were
going
to
raise
kirdjali
but
he
got
up
of
his
own
accord
gathered
up
his
chains
and
stepping
into
the
cried
the
gens
got
in
by
his
side
the
moldavian
cracked
his
whip
and
the
rolled
away
what
was
kirdjali
saying
to
you
inquired
a
young
official
of
the
police
officer
he
asked
me
replied
the
officer
smiling
to
take
care
of
his
wife
and
child
who
live
a
short
distance
from
kilia
in
a
bulgarian
village
he
is
afraid
they
might
suffer
through
him
the
rabble
are
so
ignorant
the
young
official
story
affected
me
greatly
i
was
sorry
for
poor
kirdjali
for
a
long
while
i
knew
nothing
of
his
fate
many
years
afterwards
i
met
the
young
official
we
began
talking
of
old
times
how
about
your
friend
kirdjali
i
asked
do
you
know
what
became
of
him
of
course
i
do
he
replied
and
he
told
me
the
following
after
being
brought
to
jassy
kirdjali
was
taken
before
the
pasha
who
condemned
him
to
be
impaled
the
execution
was
postponed
till
some
feast
day
meanwhile
he
was
put
in
confinement
the
prisoner
was
guarded
by
seven
turks
common
people
and
at
the
bottom
of
their
hearts
brigands
like
himself
they
respected
him
and
listened
with
the
eagerness
of
true
orientals
to
his
wonderful
stories
between
the
guards
and
their
prisoner
a
close
friendship
sprang
up
on
one
occasion
kirdjali
said
to
them
brothers
my
hour
is
near
no
one
can
escape
his
doom
i
shall
soon
part
from
you
and
i
should
like
to
leave
you
something
in
remembrance
of
me
the
turks
opened
their
ears
brothers
added
kirdjali
three
years
back
when
i
was
engaged
in
brigandage
with
the
late
mihailaki
we
buried
in
the
steppes
not
far
from
jassy
a
kettle
with
some
coins
in
it
seemingly
neither
he
nor
i
will
ever
possess
that
treasure
so
be
it
take
it
to
yourselves
and
divide
it
amicably
the
turks
nearly
went
crazy
they
began
considering
how
they
could
find
the
spot
so
vaguely
indicated
they
thought
and
thought
and
at
last
decided
that
kirdjali
must
himself
show
them
night
set
in
the
turks
took
off
the
fetters
that
weighed
upon
the
prisoner
feet
hound
his
hands
with
a
rope
and
taking
him
with
them
started
for
the
steppes
kirdjali
led
them
going
in
a
straight
line
from
one
mound
to
another
they
walked
about
for
some
time
at
last
kirdjali
stopped
close
to
a
broad
stone
measured
a
dozen
steps
to
the
south
stamped
and
said
here
the
turks
arranged
themselves
for
work
four
took
out
their
daggers
and
began
digging
the
earth
while
three
remained
on
guard
kirdjali
sat
down
on
the
stone
and
looked
on
well
now
shall
you
be
long
he
inquired
have
you
found
it
not
yet
replied
the
turks
and
they
worked
away
till
the
perspiration
rolled
like
hail
from
them
kirdjali
grew
impatient
what
people
he
exclaimed
they
ca
even
dig
decently
why
i
should
have
found
it
in
two
minutes
children
untie
my
hands
and
give
me
a
dagger
the
turks
reflected
and
began
to
consult
with
one
another
why
not
they
concluded
we
will
release
his
hands
and
give
him
a
dagger
what
can
it
matter
he
is
only
one
while
we
are
seven
and
the
turks
unbound
his
bands
and
gave
him
a
dagger
at
last
kirdjali
was
free
and
armed
what
must
have
been
his
sensations
he
began
digging
rapidly
the
guard
assisting
suddenly
he
thrust
his
dagger
into
one
of
them
leaving
the
blade
sticking
in
the
man
breast
he
snatched
from
his
girdle
a
couple
of
pistols
the
remaining
six
seeing
kirdjali
armed
with
two
pistols
ran
away
kirdjali
is
now
carrying
on
his
brigandage
near
jassy
not
long
ago
he
wrote
to
the
hospodar
demanding
from
him
five
thousand
louis
and
threatening
in
the
event
of
the
money
not
being
paid
to
set
fire
to
jassy
and
to
reach
the
hospodar
himself
the
five
thousand
louis
were
forwarded
to
him
a
fine
fellow
kirdjali
the
history
of
the
village
of
gorohina
of
all
professions
that
of
a
man
of
letters
has
always
seemed
to
me
most
enviable
my
parents
respectable
but
humble
folk
had
been
brought
up
in
the
old
fashion
they
never
read
anything
and
beyond
an
alphabet
bought
for
me
an
almanack
and
the
latest
they
had
no
books
in
the
house
the
had
long
provided
me
with
entertainment
i
knew
it
by
heart
yet
daily
found
in
it
fresh
beauties
and
next
to
general
n
to
whom
my
father
had
been
kurganoff
its
author
was
in
my
estimation
one
of
the
greatest
men
i
questioned
everyone
about
him
but
unhappily
no
one
could
gratify
my
curiosity
nobody
knew
him
personally
to
all
my
questioning
the
reply
was
that
kurganoff
was
the
author
of
the
latest
but
that
i
knew
already
he
was
wrapped
in
darkness
and
mystery
like
some
ancient
at
times
i
doubted
even
his
existence
his
name
was
perhaps
an
invention
the
legend
about
him
an
empty
myth
awaiting
the
investigation
of
some
new
niebuhr
nevertheless
he
dogged
my
imagination
i
tried
to
give
some
form
to
this
very
personage
and
finally
decided
that
he
must
be
like
the
koriuchkin
a
little
old
man
with
a
red
nose
and
glittering
eyes
in
i
was
taken
to
moscow
and
placed
at
a
boarding
school
belonging
to
karl
ivanovitch
meyer
there
i
stayed
only
some
three
months
because
the
school
broke
up
in
anticipation
of
the
enemy
coming
i
returned
to
the
country
this
epoch
of
my
life
was
to
me
so
important
that
i
shall
dilate
upon
it
apologizing
beforehand
if
i
trespass
upon
the
good
nature
of
the
reader
it
was
a
dull
autumn
day
on
reaching
the
station
whence
i
must
turn
off
to
gorohina
that
was
the
name
of
our
village
i
engaged
horses
and
drove
off
by
the
country
road
though
naturally
calm
so
impatient
was
i
to
revisit
the
scenes
where
i
had
passed
the
best
years
of
my
life
that
i
kept
urging
the
driver
to
quicken
speed
with
alternate
promises
of
vodka
and
threats
of
chastisement
how
much
easier
it
was
to
belabour
him
than
to
unloose
my
purse
i
own
i
struck
him
twice
or
thrice
a
thing
i
had
never
done
in
my
life
before
i
do
know
why
but
i
had
a
great
liking
for
drivers
as
a
class
the
driver
urged
his
troika
to
a
quicker
pace
but
to
me
it
seemed
that
he
coaxed
the
horses
and
waved
his
whip
but
at
the
same
time
tightened
the
reins
at
last
i
caught
sight
of
gorohina
wood
and
in
ten
minutes
more
we
drove
into
the
courtyard
of
the
manor
house
my
heart
beat
violently
i
looked
round
with
unwonted
emotion
for
eight
years
i
had
not
seen
gorohina
the
little
birches
which
i
had
seen
planted
near
the
palings
had
now
grown
into
tall
branching
trees
the
courtyard
once
adorned
with
three
regular
flower
beds
divided
by
broad
gravel
paths
was
now
an
unmown
meadow
the
grazing
land
of
a
red
cow
my
britchka
stopped
at
the
front
door
my
servant
went
to
open
it
but
it
was
fastened
yet
the
shutters
were
open
and
the
house
seemed
to
be
inhabited
a
woman
emerging
from
a
servant
hut
asked
what
i
wanted
hearing
the
master
had
arrived
she
ran
back
into
the
hut
and
soon
i
had
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
courtyard
around
me
i
was
deeply
touched
to
see
the
known
and
unknown
faces
and
i
greeted
each
with
a
friendly
kiss
the
boys
my
playmates
had
grown
to
men
the
girls
who
used
to
squat
upon
the
floor
and
run
with
such
alacrity
on
errands
were
married
women
the
men
wept
to
the
women
i
said
unceremoniously
how
you
have
aged
and
they
answered
sadly
and
you
little
father
how
plain
you
have
grown
they
led
me
towards
the
back
entrance
i
was
met
by
my
old
by
whom
i
was
welcomed
back
with
sobs
and
tears
like
the
ulysses
they
hastened
to
heat
the
bath
the
cook
who
in
his
long
holiday
had
grown
a
beard
offered
to
cook
my
dinner
or
supper
for
it
was
growing
dark
the
rooms
hitherto
occupied
by
my
nurse
and
my
late
mother
maids
were
at
once
got
ready
for
me
thus
i
found
myself
in
the
humble
home
of
my
parents
and
fell
asleep
in
that
room
where
years
before
i
had
been
born
some
three
weeks
passed
in
business
of
various
kinds
i
was
engaged
with
land
judges
presidents
and
every
imaginable
official
of
the
province
finally
i
got
possession
of
my
inheritance
i
was
contented
but
soon
the
dulness
of
inaction
began
to
torment
me
i
was
not
yet
acquainted
with
my
kind
and
venerable
neighbour
n
domestic
occupations
were
altogether
strange
to
me
the
conversation
of
my
nurse
whom
i
promoted
to
the
rank
of
housekeeper
consisted
of
fifteen
family
anecdotes
i
found
them
very
interesting
but
as
she
always
related
them
in
the
same
way
she
soon
became
for
me
another
niebuhr
in
which
i
knew
precisely
on
what
page
every
particular
line
occurred
that
worthy
book
i
found
in
the
storeroom
among
a
quantity
of
rubbish
sadly
dilapidated
i
brought
it
out
into
the
light
and
began
to
read
it
but
kurganoff
had
lost
his
charm
i
read
him
through
once
more
and
never
after
opened
him
again
in
this
extremity
it
struck
me
why
not
write
myself
the
reader
has
been
already
told
that
i
was
educated
on
copper
money
besides
to
become
an
author
seemed
so
difficult
so
unattainable
that
the
idea
of
writing
quite
frightened
me
at
first
dare
i
hope
ever
to
be
numbered
amongst
writers
when
my
ardent
wish
even
to
meet
one
had
not
yet
been
gratified
this
reminds
me
of
something
which
i
shall
tell
to
show
my
unbounded
enthusiasm
for
my
native
literature
in
while
yet
an
ensign
i
chanced
to
be
on
government
business
at
petersburg
i
stayed
a
week
and
although
i
had
not
one
acquaintance
in
he
place
i
passed
the
time
very
pleasantly
i
went
daily
to
the
theatre
modestly
to
the
fourth
row
in
the
gallery
i
learnt
the
names
of
all
the
actors
and
fell
passionately
in
love
with
b
she
had
played
one
sunday
with
great
artistic
feeling
as
eulalie
in
und
in
english
in
the
morning
on
my
way
from
headquarters
i
would
call
at
a
small
confectioner
drink
a
cup
of
chocolate
and
read
a
literary
journal
one
day
while
thus
deep
in
an
article
by
goodintention
some
one
in
a
greatcoat
suddenly
approached
and
gently
withdrew
the
from
under
my
newspaper
i
was
so
occupied
that
i
did
not
look
up
the
stranger
ordered
a
steak
and
sat
down
facing
me
i
went
on
reading
without
noticing
him
meanwhile
he
finished
his
luncheon
scolded
the
waiter
for
some
carelessness
drank
half
a
bottle
of
wine
and
left
two
young
men
were
also
lunching
do
you
know
who
that
was
inquired
one
of
them
that
was
goodintention
the
writer
the
writer
i
exclaimed
involuntarily
and
leaving
the
article
unread
and
the
cup
of
chocolate
undrunk
i
hastily
paid
my
reckoning
and
without
waiting
for
the
change
rushed
into
the
street
looking
round
i
descried
in
the
distance
the
coat
and
dashed
along
the
nevsky
prospect
almost
at
a
run
when
i
had
gone
several
steps
i
felt
myself
stopped
by
some
one
and
looking
back
i
found
i
had
been
noticed
by
an
officer
of
the
guards
i
ought
not
to
have
knocked
against
him
on
the
pavement
but
rather
to
have
stopped
and
saluted
after
this
reprimand
i
was
more
careful
unluckily
i
met
an
officer
every
moment
and
every
moment
i
had
to
stop
while
the
author
got
farther
and
farther
away
never
before
had
my
soldier
overcoat
proved
so
irksome
never
had
epaulettes
appeared
so
enviable
at
last
near
the
annitchkin
bridge
i
came
up
with
the
greatcoat
may
i
inquire
i
said
saluting
are
you
goodintention
whose
excellent
article
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
reading
in
the
enlightener
not
at
all
he
replied
i
am
not
a
writer
but
a
lawyer
but
i
know
goodintention
very
well
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
i
passed
him
at
the
police
bridge
in
this
way
my
respect
for
russian
letters
cost
me
kopecks
of
change
an
official
reprimand
and
a
narrow
escape
of
arrest
and
all
in
vain
in
spite
of
all
the
protest
of
my
reason
the
audacious
thought
of
becoming
a
writer
kept
recurring
at
last
unable
longer
to
resist
it
i
made
a
thick
copy
book
and
resolved
to
fill
it
somehow
all
kinds
of
poems
humble
prose
did
not
yet
enter
into
my
reckoning
were
in
turn
considered
and
approved
i
decided
to
write
an
epic
furnished
on
russian
history
i
was
not
long
in
finding
a
hero
i
chose
rurik
and
i
set
to
work
i
had
acquired
a
certain
aptitude
for
rhymes
by
copying
those
in
manuscript
which
used
to
circulate
among
our
officers
such
as
the
criticism
on
the
moscow
boulevards
the
presnensky
ponds
and
the
dangerous
neighbour
in
spite
of
that
my
poem
progressed
slowly
and
at
the
third
verse
i
dropped
it
i
concluded
that
the
epic
was
not
my
style
and
began
the
tragedy
halted
i
turned
it
into
a
ballad
but
the
ballad
hardly
seemed
to
do
at
last
i
had
a
happy
thought
i
began
and
succeeded
in
finishing
an
ode
to
a
portrait
of
rurik
despite
the
inauspicious
character
of
such
a
title
particularly
for
a
young
bard
first
work
i
yet
felt
that
i
had
not
been
born
a
poet
and
after
this
first
attempt
desisted
these
essays
in
authorship
gave
me
so
great
a
taste
for
writing
that
i
could
now
no
longer
abstain
from
paper
and
ink
i
could
descend
to
prose
but
at
first
i
wished
to
avoid
the
preliminary
construction
of
a
plot
and
the
connection
of
parts
i
resolved
to
write
detached
thoughts
without
any
connection
or
order
just
as
they
struck
me
unfortunately
the
thoughts
would
not
come
and
in
the
course
of
two
whole
days
the
only
thought
that
struck
me
was
the
following
he
who
disobeys
reason
and
yields
to
the
inclination
of
his
passions
often
goes
wrong
and
ends
by
repenting
when
it
is
too
late
this
though
no
doubt
true
enough
was
not
original
abandoning
aphorism
i
took
to
tales
but
being
too
unpractised
in
arranging
incidents
i
selected
such
remarkable
occurrences
as
i
had
heard
of
at
various
times
and
tried
to
ornament
the
truth
by
a
lively
style
and
the
flowers
of
my
own
imagination
composing
these
tales
little
by
little
i
formed
my
style
and
learnt
to
express
myself
correctly
pleasantly
and
freely
my
stock
was
soon
exhausted
and
i
again
began
to
seek
a
subject
to
abandon
these
childish
anecdotes
of
doubtful
authenticity
and
narrate
real
and
great
events
instead
was
an
idea
by
which
i
had
long
been
haunted
to
be
the
judge
the
observer
and
the
prophet
of
ages
and
of
peoples
seemed
to
me
a
most
attainable
object
of
ambition
to
a
writer
what
history
could
i
write
i
with
my
pitiable
education
where
was
i
not
forestalled
by
highly
cultivated
and
conscientious
men
what
history
had
they
left
unexhausted
should
i
write
a
universal
history
but
was
there
not
already
the
immortal
work
of
abb√©
millot
a
national
history
of
russia
what
could
i
say
after
tatishtcheff
bolitin
and
golikoff
and
was
it
for
me
to
burrow
amongst
records
and
to
penetrate
the
occult
meaning
of
a
dead
language
for
me
who
could
never
master
the
slavonian
alphabet
why
not
try
a
history
on
a
smaller
scale
for
instance
the
history
of
our
town
but
even
here
how
very
numerous
and
insuperable
seemed
the
obstacles
a
journey
to
the
town
a
visit
to
the
governor
and
the
bishop
permission
to
examine
the
archives
the
monastery
the
cellars
and
so
on
the
history
of
our
town
would
have
been
easier
but
it
could
interest
neither
the
philosopher
nor
the
artist
and
afford
but
little
opening
for
eloquence
the
only
noteworthy
record
in
its
annals
relates
to
a
terrible
fire
ten
years
ago
which
burnt
the
bazaar
and
the
courts
of
justice
an
accident
settled
my
doubts
a
woman
hanging
linen
in
a
loft
found
an
old
basket
full
of
shavings
dust
and
books
the
whole
household
knew
my
passion
for
reading
my
housekeeper
while
i
sat
over
my
paper
gnawing
my
pen
and
meditating
on
the
experience
of
country
prophets
entered
triumphantly
dragging
a
basket
into
my
room
and
bringing
joyfully
books
books
books
i
repeated
in
delight
as
i
rushed
to
the
basket
actually
a
pile
of
them
with
covers
of
green
and
of
blue
paper
it
was
a
collection
of
old
almanacks
my
ardour
was
cooled
by
the
discovery
still
they
were
books
and
i
generously
rewarded
her
pains
with
half
a
silver
ruble
when
she
had
gone
i
began
to
examine
my
almanacks
i
soon
became
absorbed
they
formed
a
complete
series
from
to
including
exactly
years
the
blue
sheets
of
paper
usually
bound
in
the
almanacks
were
covered
with
handwriting
skimming
these
lines
i
noticed
with
surprise
that
besides
remarks
on
the
weather
and
accounts
they
contained
scraps
of
historical
information
about
the
village
of
gorohina
among
these
valuable
documents
i
began
my
researches
and
soon
found
that
they
presented
a
full
history
of
my
native
place
for
nearly
a
century
in
chronological
order
besides
an
exhaustive
store
of
economical
statistical
meteorological
and
other
learned
information
thenceforth
the
study
of
these
documents
took
up
my
time
for
i
perceived
that
from
them
a
stately
instructive
and
interesting
history
could
be
made
as
i
became
sufficiently
acquainted
with
these
valuable
notes
i
began
to
search
for
new
sources
of
information
about
the
village
of
gorohina
and
i
soon
became
astonished
at
the
wealth
of
material
after
devoting
six
months
to
a
preliminary
study
of
them
i
at
last
began
the
long
wished
for
work
and
by
grace
completed
the
same
on
the
of
november
like
a
whose
name
i
do
not
recollect
having
finished
my
hard
task
i
lay
down
my
pen
and
sadly
walk
into
my
garden
to
meditate
upon
my
performance
it
seems
even
to
me
that
now
the
history
of
gorohina
is
finished
i
am
no
longer
wanted
in
the
world
my
task
is
ended
and
it
is
time
for
me
to
die
i
add
a
list
of
the
sources
whence
i
drew
the
history
of
gorohina
i
a
collection
of
ancient
almanacks
in
fifty
fifty
five
parts
of
these
the
first
twenty
are
covered
with
an
writing
much
abbreviated
the
manuscript
is
that
of
my
grandfather
andrei
stepanovitch
belkin
and
is
remarkably
clear
and
concise
for
example
of
may
snow
trishka
for
his
impertinence
beaten
the
red
cow
died
senka
for
drunkenness
beaten
a
fine
day
rain
and
snow
trishka
for
drunkenness
beaten
and
so
on
without
comment
the
weather
fine
first
snow
hunted
three
hares
the
remaining
parts
were
in

this
curious
manuscript
was
discovered
by
me
at
the
house
of
my
priest
who
has
married
the
daughter
of
the
writer
the
first
earlier
sheets
had
been
torn
out
and
used
by
the
priests
children
for
making
kites
one
of
these
had
fallen
in
the
middle
of
my
yard
i
picked
it
up
and
was
about
to
restore
it
to
the
children
when
i
noticed
that
it
was
written
on
from
the
first
lines
i
saw
that
the
kite
was
made
out
of
some
one
journal
luckily
i
was
in
time
to
save
the
rest
these
journals
which
i
got
for
a
measure
of
oats
are
remarkable
for
depth
of
thought
and
dignity
of
expression
iii
oral

i
despised
no

but
i
am
specially
indebted
for
much
of
this

october
fabulous
times
the
starosta
tryphon
the
foundation
of
gorohina
and
the
history
of
its
original
inhabitants
are
lost
in
obscurity
dark
legend
tells
how
that
gorohina
was
once
a
large
and
wealthy
village
that
all
its
inhabitants
were
rich
that
the
obrok
the
land
proprietor
tithes
was
collected
once
a
year
and
carted
off
in
loads
no
one
knew
to
whom
at
that
time
everything
was
bought
cheap
and
sold
dear
there
were
no
stewards
and
the
elders
dealt
fairly
by
all
the
inhabitants
worked
little
and
lived
merrily
the
shepherds
as
they
watched
their
flocks
wore
boots
we
must
not
be
deceived
by
this
charming
picture
the
notion
of
a
golden
age
is
common
to
all
nations
and
only
proves
that
as
people
are
never
contented
with
the
present
and
derive
from
experience
small
hope
for
the
future
they
adorn
the
irrevocable
past
with
all
the
hues
of
fancy
what
is
certain
however
is
that
the
village
of
gorohina
from
ancient
times
has
belonged
to
the
distinguished
race
of
belkins
but
these
ancestors
of
mine
had
many
other
estates
and
paid
but
little
attention
to
this
remote
village
gorohina
paid
small
tithe
and
was
managed
by
elders
elected
by
the
people
in
common
council
at
that
early
period
the
inheritance
of
the
belkins
was
broken
up
and
fell
in
value
the
impoverished
grandchildren
of
the
rich
grandsire
unable
to
give
up
their
luxurious
habits
required
from
an
estate
now
only
producing
one
tenth
of
its
former
revenue
the
full
income
of
former
times
threats
followed
threats
the
starosta
read
them
out
in
common
council
the
elders
declaimed
the
commune
agitated
and
the
masters
instead
of
the
double
tithes
received
tiresome
excuses
and
humble
complaints
written
on
dirty
paper
and
sealed
with
a
less
than
a
farthing
a
sombre
cloud
hung
over
gorohina
but
no
one
heeded
it
in
the
last
year
of
tryphon
power
the
last
of
the
starostas
chosen
by
the
people
the
day
of
the
church
festival
when
the
whole
population
either
crowded
noisily
round
the
house
of
entertainment
the
or
wandered
through
the
streets
embracing
one
another
or
loudly
singing
the
songs
of
arhip
the
bald
there
drove
into
the
courtyard
a
covered
hired
drawn
by
a
couple
of
screws
with
a
ragged
jew
upon
the
box
from
the
britchka
a
head
in
a
cap
looked
out
and
seemed
to
peer
curiously
at
the
crowd
the
inhabitants
greeted
the
carriage
with
laughter
and
rude
jokes
with
the
flaps
of
their
coats
turned
up
the
madmen
mocked
the
jewish
driver
shouting
in
doggrell
rhyme
jew
jew
eat
a
pig
ear
but
how
great
was
their
astonishment
wrote
the
clerk
when
the
carriage
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
village
and
the
occupant
jumped
out
and
in
an
authoritative
voice
called
for
the
starosta
tryphon
this
officer
was
in
the
house
of
pleasure
whence
two
elders
led
him
forth
holding
him
under
the
arms
the
stranger
looked
at
him
sternly
handed
him
a
letter
and
told
him
to
read
it
at
once
the
starostas
of
gorohina
were
in
the
habit
of
never
reading
anything
themselves
the
rural
clerk
avdei
was
sent
for
he
was
found
asleep
under
a
hedge
and
was
brought
before
the
stranger
but
either
from
the
sudden
fright
or
from
a
sad
the
words
distinctly
written
in
the
letter
appeared
to
him
in
a
mist
and
he
could
not
read
them
the
stranger
sent
the
starosta
tryphon
and
the
rural
clerk
avdei
with
terrible
curses
to
bed
postponing
the
reading
of
the
letter
till
the
morrow
and
entered
the
office
hut
whither
the
jew
carried
his
small
trunk
the
people
of
gorohina
looked
in
amazement
at
this
unusual
incident
but
the
carriage
the
stranger
and
the
jew
were
quickly
forgotten
they
ended
their
day
with
noise
and
merriment
and
gorohina
went
to
sleep
without
presentiments
of
the
future
at
sunrise
the
inhabitants
were
awakened
with
knockings
at
the
windows
and
a
call
to
a
meeting
of
the
commune
the
citizens
one
after
the
other
appeared
in
the
courtyard
round
the
office
hut
which
served
as
a
council
ground
their
eyes
were
dim
and
red
their
faces
swollen
yawning
and
scratching
their
heads
they
stared
at
the
man
with
the
cap
in
an
old
blue
caftan
standing
pompously
on
the
steps
of
the
office
hut
while
they
tried
to
recollect
his
features
which
they
seemed
to
have
seen
some
time
or
another
the
starosta
and
his
clerk
avdei
stood
by
his
side
bareheaded
with
the
same
expression
of
dejection
and
sorrow
are
all
here
inquired
the
stranger
are
all
here
repeated
the
starosta
the
whole
hundred
replied
the
citizens
when
the
starosta
informed
them
that
he
had
received
a
letter
from
the
master
and
directed
the
clerk
to
read
it
aloud
to
the
commune
avdei
stepped
forward
and
read
as
follows
this
alarming
document
which
he
kept
carefully
shut
up
in
the
together
with
other
memorandum
of
his
authority
over
the
people
of
gorohina
i
copied
at
the
house
of
tryphon
our
starosta
tryphon
ivanoff
the
bearer
of
this
letter
my
agent
is
going
to
my
patrimony
the
village
of
gorohina
to
assume
the
management
of
it
directly
he
arrives
assemble
the
peasants
and
make
known
to
them
their
wishes
namely
that
they
are
to
obey
my
agent
as
they
would
myself
and
attend
to
his
orders
without
demur
otherwise
he
is
empowered
to
treat
them
with
great
severity
i
have
been
forced
to
take
this
step
by
their
shameless
disobedience
and
your
tryphon
ivanoff
roguish
indulgence
signed
nikolai
then
the
agent
with
his
legs
extended
like
an
x
and
his
arms
akimbo
like
a
phitab
addressed
to
them
the
following
pithy
speech
see
that
you
are
not
too
troublesome
or
i
will
certainly
beat
the
folly
out
of
your
heads
quicker
than
the
fumes
of
yesterday
drink
there
were
no
longer
any
fumes
left
in
the
head
of
any
man
of
gorohina
all
were
dumbfounded
hung
their
noses
and
dispersed
in
fear
to
their
own
houses
the
agent
seized
the
reins
of
government
called
for
the
list
of
peasants
divided
them
into
rich
and
poor
and
began
to
carry
into
effect
his
political
system
which
deserves
particular
description
it
was
founded
upon
the
following
maxims
that
the
richer
a
peasant
the
more
fractious
he
grows
and
the
poorer
the
quieter
consequently
like
a
good
christian
i
cared
most
for
the
peace
of
the
estate
first
the
deficits
were
distributed
among
the
rich
peasants
and
were
exacted
from
them
with
the
greatest
severity
second
the
defaulting
or
idle
hands
were
forthwith
set
to
plough
and
if
their
labour
proved
insufficient
according
to
his
standard
he
assigned
them
as
workmen
to
the
other
peasants
who
paid
him
for
this
a
voluntary
tax
the
men
given
as
bondsmen
on
the
other
hand
possessed
the
right
of
redeeming
themselves
by
paying
besides
their
deficit
a
double
annual
tithe
all
the
communal
obligations
were
thrown
upon
the
rich
peasants
but
the
recruiting
arrangements
were
the
masterpiece
of
the
avaricious
ruler
for
by
turns
all
the
rich
peasants
bought
themselves
off
till
at
last
the
choice
fell
upon
either
the
blackguard
or
the
ruined
one
communal
assemblies
were
abolished
the
tithes
were
collected
in
small
sums
and
all
the
year
round
the
peasants
it
seems
did
not
pay
very
much
more
than
before
but
they
could
not
earn
or
save
enough
to
pay
in
three
years
gorohina
was
quite
pauperised
gorohina
quieted
down
the
bazaar
was
empty
the
songs
of
arhip
the
bald
were
unsung
one
half
the
men
were
ploughing
in
the
fields
the
other
half
serving
them
as
bond
labourers
the
children
went
begging
and
the
day
of
the
church
f√™te
became
according
to
the
historian
not
a
day
of
joy
and
exultation
but
an
annual
mourning
and
commemoration
of
sorrow
from
a
gorohina
annalist
the
accursed
steward
put
anton
timofeieff
into
irons
but
the
old
man
timofei
bought
his
son
freedom
for
one
hundred
rubles
the
steward
then
put
the
irons
on
petrusha
gremeieff
who
likewise
was
ransomed
by
his
father
for
rubles
the
accursed
one
then
wanted
to
handcuff
lech
tarassoff
but
he
escaped
into
the
woods
to
the
regret
of
the
steward
who
vented
his
rage
in
words
but
sent
to
town
in
place
of
lech
tarassoff
vanka
the
drunkard
and
gave
him
for

substitute

abroad
by
peter
the
great
to
acquire
the
information
necessary
for

civilised
country
was
his
godson
ibrahim
the
negro
he
was
educated
in
a
parisian
military
school
passed
out
as
a
captain
of
the
artillery
distinguished
himself
in
the
spanish
war
and
when
seriously
wounded
returned
to
paris
in
the
midst
of
his
enormous
labours
the
emperor
never
ceased
to
ask
after
his
favourite
of
whose
progress
and
good
conduct
the
accounts
were
always
favourable
peter
was
exceedingly
pleased
with
him
and
frequently
invited
him
to
russia
but
ibrahim
was
in
no
hurry
he
excused
himself
either
his
wound
or
his
wish
to
complete
his
education
or
want
of
money
served
as
the
pretext
and
peter
complied
with
his
wishes
begged
him
to
take
care
of
his
health
thanked
him
for
his
assiduity
in
study
and
though
exceedingly
economical
himself
was
lavish
to
his
and
sent
together
with
gold
pieces
fatherly
advice
and
warning
judging
by
all
historical
accounts
the
flightiness
madness
and
luxury
of
the
french
of
that
period
were
unequalled
the
latter
years

for
the
strict
piety

propriety
of

many
brilliant
qualities

not

the
orgies
of

the

ibrahim
arrival
his
appearance
culture
and
native
wit
attracted
general
attention
in
paris
all
the
ladies
fought
for
a
visit
from
the
tsar
negro
more
than
once
was
he
invited
to
the
regent
merry
evenings
he
was
present
at
the
suppers
enlivened
by
the
youth
of
voltaire
and
the
age
of
shollier
the
conversations
of
montesquieu
and
fontenelle
not
a
ball
not
a
f√™te
not
one
first
representation
did
he
miss
and
he
gave
himself
up
to
the
general
whirl
with
all
the
passion
of
his
youth
and
nature
but
the
idea
of
exchanging
these
entertainments
these
brilliant
pleasures
for
the
simplicity
of
the
petersburg
court
was
not
all
that
ibrahim
dreaded
other
and
stronger
ties
bound
him
to
paris
the
young
african
was
in
love
no
longer
in
the
first
bloom
of
youth
the
countess
was
still
celebrated
for
her
beauty
at
seventeen
on
leaving
the
convent
she
was
married
to
a
man
for
whom
she
had
not
learnt
to
feel
the
love
which
ultimately
he
showed
no
care
to
win
rumour
assigned
her
lovers
but
through
the
leniency
of
society
she
still
enjoyed
a
good
repute
for
nothing
ridiculous
or
scandalous
could
be
brought
against
her
her
house
was
the
most
fashionable
a
centre
of
the
best
society
in
paris
ibrahim
was
introduced
by
young
de
merville
who
was
regarded
generally
as
her
latest
lover
an
impression
which
he
tried
by
every
means
to
strengthen
the
countess
received
ibrahim
with
civility
but
without
particular
attention
he
was
flattered
usually
the
young
negro
was
regarded
with
wonder
surrounded
and
overwhelmed
with
attention
and
questions
and
this
curiosity
though
veiled
by
a
display
of
friendliness
offended
his
vanity
the
delightful
attention
of
women
almost
the
sole
aim
of
our
exertions
not
only
gave
him
no
pleas
are
but
even
ailed
him
with
bitterness
and
wrath
he
felt
that
he
was
for
them
a
species
of
rare
animal
a
strange
peculiar
creature
accidentally
brought
into
a
world
with
which
he
had
naught
in
common
he
even
envied
those
whom
no
one
noticed
and
deemed
their
insignificance
a
blessing
the
idea
that
nature
had
not
formed
him
for
tender
passion
robbed
him
of
all
and
conceit
and
added
a
rare
charm
to
his
manner
towards
women
his
conversation
was
simple
and
dignified
he
pleased
the
countess
who
was
tired
of
the
formal
pleasantries
and
pointed
innuendoes
of
french
wit
ibrahim
visited
her
often
little
by
little
she
grew
used
to
the
young
negro
looks
and
even
began
to
find
something
agreeable
in
that
early
head
so
black
amid
the
powdered
wigs
that
thronged
her
ibrahim
had
been
wounded
in
the
head
and
wore
a
bandage
in
the
place
of
a
wig
he
was
tall
and
well
built
and
more
than
one
beauty
glanced
at
him
with
feelings
more
flattering
to
him
than
mere
curiosity
but
ibraham
either
did
not
observe
them
or
thought
their
notice
merely
coquetry
but
when
his
gaze
met
that
of
the
countess
his
mistrust
vanished
her
eyes
expressed
so
much
kindness
her
manner
to
him
was
so
simple
so
easy
that
it
was
impossible
to
suspect
her
of
the
least
coquetry
or
insincerity
though
no
thought
of
love
entered
his
mind
to
see
the
countess
daily
had
become
a
necessity
he
tried
to
meet
her
everywhere
and
every
meeting
seemed
a
godsend
the
countess
guessed
his
feelings
before
he
did
so
himself
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
love
which
hopes
nothing
and
asks
nothing
touches
the
female
heart
more
surely
than
all
the
arts
of
the
experienced
when
ibrahim
was
near
the
countess
followed
all
his
movements
listened
to
all
his
words
without
him
she
became
pensive
and
fell
into
her
usual
abstraction
merville
was
first
to
notice
their
mutual
attraction
and
congratulated
ibrahim
nothing
inflames
love
like
approving
comments
of
outsiders
love
is
blind
and
putting
no
trust
in
itself
clings
eagerly
to
every
support
merville
words
roused
ibrahim
hope
suddenly
dawned
upon
his
soul
he
fell
madly
in
love
in
vain
the
countess
alarmed
by
the
vehemence
of
his
passion
wished
to
meet
him
with
friendly
warnings
and
sage
counsels
but
she
herself
was
growing
weak
nothing
escapes
the
eye
of
the
vigilant
world
the
countess
new
attachment
soon
became
known
some
ladies
wondered
at
her
choice
many
found
him
very
ordinary
some
laughed
others
considered
her
inexcusably
imprudent
in
the
first
intoxication
of
their
passion
ibrahim
and
the
countess
noticed
nothing
but
soon
the
jokes
of
the
men
the
sarcasms
of
the
women
began
to
reach
them
ibrahim
formal
and
cold
manner
had
hitherto
guarded
him
from
such
attacks
he
bore
them
with
impatience
and
knew
not
how
to
retaliate
the
countess
accustomed
to
the
respect
of
society
could
not
calmly
endure
to
see
herself
an
object
of
ridicule
and
scandal
she
complained
to
ibrahim
either
with
tears
or
bitter
reproaches
then
she
begged
him
not
to
take
her
part
nor
ruin
her
completely
by
useless
disturbance
fresh
circumstances
complicated
her
position
still
more
results
of
her
imprudent
love
began
to
show
themselves
the
countess
in
distress
told
ibrahim
consolation
advice
suggestions
were
in
turn
exhausted
and
rejected
she
foresaw
her
inevitable
ruin
and
in
despair
awaited
it
immediately
the
countesses
condition
became
known
reports
circulated
with
renewed
vigour
sensitive
women
exclaimed
in
horror
the
men
made
bets
whether
she
would
bear
a
white
or
a
black
child
epigrams
poured
in
about
her
husband
who
alone
in
all
paris
suspected
nothing
the
fatal
moment
approached
the
countess
was
in
a
terrible
state
ibrahim
called
every
day
he
saw
her
strength
of
mind
and
body
gradually
failing
her
tears
and
terror
increased
momentarily
at
last
she
felt
the
first
throes
measures
were
taken
hurriedly
means
were
found
to
get
the
count
out
of
the
way
the
doctor
arrived
two
days
previous
to
this
a
poor
woman
had
been
persuaded
to
resign
into
the
hands
of
strangers
her
infant
for
which
a
messenger
was
sent
ibrahim
remained
in
the
study
next
the
bedroom
where
the
unhappy
countess
lay
scarcely
daring
to
breathe
he
heard
muffled
groans
the
maidservants
whispers
and
the
doctor
directions
she
suffered
long
each
groan
lacerated
ibrahim
heart
and
every
silent
pause
filled
him
with
dread
suddenly
he
heard
the
weak
cry
of
a
child
and
unable
to
control
his
delight
rushed
into
the
countess
room
a
black
infant
lay
on
the
bed
at
her
feet
ibrahim
approached
it
his
heart
throbbed
violently
he
blessed
his
son
with
a
trembling
hand
the
countess
with
a
faint
smile
stretched
towards
him
a
feeble
hand
but
the
doctor
fearing
too
much
excitement
for
his
patient
dragged
ibrahim
away
from
her
bedside
the
babe
was
laid
in
a
covered
basket
and
carried
out
by
a
secret
staircase
the
other
child
was
brought
in
and
its
cradle
placed
in
the
bedroom
ibrahim
left
feeling
a
trifle
calmer
the
count
was
expected
he
returned
late
heard
of
the
happy
confinement
of
his
wife
and
was
much
pleased
thus
the
public
which
expected
a
great
scandal
was
disappointed
and
forced
to
be
satisfied
with
backbiting
everything
fell
back
into
its
usual
routine
but
ibrahim
felt
that
his
life
must
undergo
a
change
and
that
his
intimacy
must
sooner
or
later
become
known
to
count
in
which
case
whatever
might
ensue
the
countess
ruin
was
inevitable
ibrahim
loved
and
was
loved
with
passion
but
the
countess
was
wilful
and
flighty
and
this
was
not
her
first
love
disgust
and
hatred
might
in
her
heart
replace
the
tenderest
feelings
ibrahim
already
foresaw
the
time
of
her
indifference
hitherto
he
had
not
known
jealousy
but
now
with
horror
he
anticipated
it
convinced
that
the
anguish
of
a
separation
would
be
less
painful
he
resolved
to
break
off
this
luckless
connection
quit
paris
and
return
to
russia
whither
peter
and
a
dull
sense
of
duty
had
long
been
calling
him
chapter
ii
days
and
months
passed
and
ibrahim
could
not
resolve
to
leave
the
woman
he
had
wronged
the
countess
from
hour
to
hour
grew
more
attached
to
him
their
son
was
being
brought
up
in
a
distant
province
social
scandal
was
subsiding
and
the
lovers
began
to
enjoy
greater
tranquillity
in
silence
remembering
the
past
storm
and
trying
not
to
think
of
the
future
one
day
ibrahim
was
standing
at
the
duke
of
orleans
door
the
duke
passing
him
stopped
handed
him
a
letter
and
bade
him
read
it
at
his
leisure
it
was
a
letter
from
peter
i
the
tsar
guessing
the
real
cause
of
his
absence
wrote
to
the
hake
that
he
in
no
way
desired
to
compel
ibrahim
and
left
it
to
his
free
will
to
return
to
russia
or
not
but
that
in
any
case
he
should
never
forsake
his
this
letter
touched
ibrahim
to
the
heart
from
that
moment
his
decision
was
made
next
day
he
announced
to
the
regent
his
intention
to
start
immediately
for
russia
consider
the
step
you
are
about
to
take
replied
the
duke
russia
is
not
your
home
i
do
think
you
will
ever
have
a
chance
of
seeing
your
torrid
africa
and
your
long
residence
in
france
has
made
you
equally
a
stranger
to
the
climate
and
the
life
of
russia
you
were
not
born
one
of
peter
subjects
take
my
advice
profit
by
his
generous
permission
stay
in
france
for
which
you
have
already
shed
your
blood
and
be
convinced
that
here
your
services
and
talents
will
not
be
left
without
their
due
reward
ibrahim
thanked
the
duke
sincerely
but
remained
firm
in
his
resolve
i
regret
it
replied
the
regent
but
on
the
whole
you
may
be
right
he
promised
to
let
him
retire
and
wrote
to
inform
the
tsar
ibrahim
was
soon
ready
for
the
journey
on
the
eve
of
his
departure
he
passed
the
evening
as
usual
at
the
countess
l
she
knew
nothing
ibrahim
had
not
the
courage
to
tell
her
the
countess
was
calm
and
cheerful
she
several
times
called
him
to
her
and
joked
about
his
pensiveness
after
supper
everybody
had
gone
leaving
in
the
only
the
countess
her
husband
and
ibrahim
the
unhappy
man
would
have
given
the
world
to
be
left
alone
with
her
but
count
seemed
to
be
settled
so
comfortably
near
the
grate
that
it
appeared
hopeless
to
wait
to
see
him
out
of
the
room
all
three
remained
silent
bonne
nuit
at
last
said
the
countess
ibrahim
heart
sank
and
he
suddenly
experienced
all
the
horrors
of
parting
he
stood
motionless
nuit
messieurs
repeated
the
countess
still
he
did
not
move
at
last
his
eyes
became
dim
his
head
went
round
and
he
could
scarcely
get
out
of
the
room
arriving
at
home
almost
mad
he
wrote
as
follows
i
am
going
dearest
leonora
to
leave
you
for
ever
i
write
because
i
have
not
the
strength
to
tell
you
otherwise
our
happiness
could
not
continue
i
have
enjoyed
it
against
the
will
of
destiny
and
nature
you
must
in
time
have
ceased
to
love
me
the
enchantment
must
have
vanished
this
idea
has
always
haunted
me
even
when
i
seemed
to
forget
all
when
at
your
feet
i
was
intoxicated
by
your
passionate
by
your
boundless
tenderness
the
thoughtless
world
mercilessly
persecute
that
which
in
theory
it
permits
sooner
or
later
its
cold
irony
would
have
vanquished
you
and
cowed
your
passionate
soul
till
finally
you
would
have
been
ashamed
of
your
love
what
then
would
have
become
of
me
better
to
die
better
to
leave
you
before
that
terrible
moment
your
happiness
to
me
is
more
precious
than
all
you
could
not
enjoy
it
while
the
gaze
of
society
was
fixed
upon
us
remember
all
you
have
endured
your
wounded
pride
the
torture
of
fear
the
terrible
birth
of
our
son
think
ought
i
any
longer
to
subject
you
to
such
fears
and
dangers
why
should
i
endeavour
to
unite
the
fate
of
so
tender
so
beautiful
a
creature
with
the
miserable
life
of
a
negro
a
pitiable
object
scarce
worthy
of
the
name
of
man
forgive
me
leonora
dear
and
only
friend
in
leaving
you
i
leave
the
first
and
last
joy
of
my
heart
i
have
no
fatherland
nor
kin
i
go
to
russia
where
my
utter
solitude
will
be
my
joy
serious
pursuits
to
which
from
henceforth
i
devote
myself
if
they
do
not
silence
must
at
any
rate
distract
painful
recollections
of
the
days
of
rapture
farewell
leonora
i
tear
myself
away
from
this
letter
as
if
from
your
embrace
farewell
be
happy
and
think
sometimes
of
the
poor
negro
of
your
faithful
ibrahim
the
same
night
he
started
for
russia
the
journey
did
not
seem
as
terrible
as
he
had
expected
his
imagination
triumphed
over
fact
the
further
he
got
from
paris
the
nearer
and
more
vivid
seemed
to
him
all
the
objects
he
was
leaving
for
ever
imperceptibly
he
reached
the
russian
frontier
autumn
had
already
set
in
but
the
hired
relays
notwithstanding
the
badness
of
the
roads
brought
him
with
the
swiftness
of
the
wind
and
on
the
seventeenth
morning
he
arrived
at
krasnoe
selo
through
which
at
that
time
passed
the
high
road
there
remained
versts
journey
to
petersburg
while
the
horses
were
being
changed
ibrahim
entered
the
in
a
corner
a
tall
man
in
a
green
caftan
and
a
clay
pipe
in
his
mouth
sat
leaning
against
the
table
reading
the
hearing
some
one
enter
he
raised
his
head
oh
ibrahim
he
exclaimed
rising
from
the
bench
how
do
you
do
godson
ibrahim
recognised
peter
and
in
his
delight
rushed
at
him
but
stopped
respectfully
the
monarch
approached
put
his
arms
round
him
and
kissed
him
on
the
forehead
i
was
told
of
your
coming
said
peter
and
drove
off
to
meet
you
i
pave
been
waiting
for
you
here
since
yesterday
ibrahim
could
not
find
words
to
express
his
gratitude
tell
them
added
the
tsar
to
let
your
carriage
follow
us
while
you
get
in
by
my
side
and
drive
to
my
place
the
tsar
cal√®che
was
announced
he
and
ibrahim
got
in
and
started
at
a
gallop
in
an
hour
and
a
half
they
reached
petersburg
ibrahim
looked
with
interest
at
the
city
which
had
sprung
up
by
the
will
of
the
tsar
the
bare
banks
the
canals
without
quays
the
wooden
bridges
everywhere
bore
witness
to
the
recent
triumph
of
human
will
over
the
elements
the
houses
seemed
to
have
been
hurriedly
built
the
whole
town
contained
nothing
magnificent
but
the
neva
not
yet
decorated
with
its
granite
framework
but
already
covered
with
ships
of
war
and
merchantmen
the
tsar
cal√®che
drew
up
at
the
palace
at
the
tsaritsa
garden
on
the
peter
was
met
by
a
woman
about
handsome
and
dressed
in
the
latest
parisian
fashion
peter
kissed
her
and
taking
ibrahim
by
the
hand
said
katinka
do
you
recognise
my
godson
i
beg
you
to
love
and
welcome
him
as
before
catherine
turned
on
him
her
black
searching
eyes
and
graciously
held
out
her
hand
two
young
beauties
tall
and
shapely
and
fresh
as
roses
stood
behind
her
and
respectfully
approached
peter
lisa
he
said
to
one
do
you
remember
the
little
negro
who
stole
apples
from
me
at
oranienburgh
to
give
to
you
here
he
is
i
introduce
him
to
you
the
grand
duchess
laughed
and
blushed
they
went
into
the
in
expectation
of
the
tsar
the
table
had
been
laid
peter
having
invited
ibrahim
sat
down
with
all
his
family
to
dinner
during
dinner
the
tsar
talked
to
him
on
different
topics
inquiring
about
the
spanish
war
the
internal
affairs
of
prance
and
the
regent
whom
he
liked
though
he
found
in
his
conduct
much
to
blame
ibrahim
displayed
an
accurate
and
observant
mind
peter
was
much
pleased
with
his
answers
remembering
some
incidents
of
ibrahim
childhood
he
related
them
with
such
merriment
that
no
one
could
have
suspected
this
kind
and
hospitable
host
to
be
the
hero
of
poltava
the
mighty
and
terrible
reformer
of
russia
after
dinner
the
tsar
according
to
the
russian
custom
retired
to
rest
ibrahim
remained
with
the
empress
and
the
grand
duchesses
he
tried
to
satisfy
their
curiosity
described
parisian
life
their
f√™tes
and
capricious
fashions
in
the
some
of
the
suite
assembled
in
the
palace
ibrahim
recognised
the
magnificent
prince
menshikoff
who
seeing
the
negro
conversing
with
catherine
cast
him
a
scornful
glance
prince
jacob
dolgoruki
peter
stern
counsellor
the
learned
bruce
known
among
the
people
as
the
russian
paustus
young
bagusinski
his
former
companion
and
others
who
had
come
to
the
tsar
to
bring
reports
and
receive
instructions
in
a
couple
of
hours
the
tsar
came
out
let
us
see
he
said
to
ibrahim
if
you
remember
your
old
duties
get
a
slate
and
follow
me
peter
locked
himself
in
the
room
and
was
engaged
with
state
affairs
he
worked
alternately
with
bruce
prince
dolgoruki
general
devi√®re
and
dictated
to
ibrahim
several
ukases
and
decisions
ibrahim
was
struck
by
the
rapidity
and
firmness
of
his
decision
the
strength
and
the
pliability
of
his
intellect
and
the
variety
of
his
occupations
when
his
work
was
ended
peter
took
out
a
pocket
book
to
compare
the
notes
and
see
if
he
had
got
through
all
he
had
meant
to
do
that
day
then
quitting
the
carpenter
workroom
he
said
to
ibrahim
it
is
late
i
dare
say
you
are
tired
sleep
the
night
here
as
in
the
old
time
i
will
wake
you
ibrahim
left
alone
could
hardly
realise
that
he
was
again
at
petersburg
in
the
presence
of
the
great
man
near
whom
not
yet
aware
of
his
great
worth
he
had
spent
his
childhood
it
was
almost
with
regret
that
he
confessed
to
himself
that
the
countess
for
the
first
time
since
they
parted
had
not
been
his
sole
thought
throughout
the
day
he
saw
that
in
the
new
mode
of
life
awaiting
him
work
and
continual
activity
might
revive
his
soul
exhausted
by
passion
indolence
and
secret
sorrow
the
idea
of
being
the
great
assistant
and
with
him
influencing
the
fate
of
a
mighty
people
awoke
in
him
for
the
first
time
the
noble
feeling
of
ambition
in
this
humour
he
lay
down
upon
the
camp
bed
prepared
for
him
and
then
the
usual
dreams
carried
him
back
to
distant
paris
to
the
arms
of
his
dear
countess
chapter
iii
next
morning
according
to
his
promise
peter
woke
ibrahim
and
greeted
him
as
of
the
preobrajensky
regiment
in
which
he
himself
was
captain
the
courtiers
flocked
round
ibrahim
each
one
in
his
own
way
trying
to
welcome
the
new
favourite
the
haughty
prince
menshikoff
gave
him
a
friendly
grasp
of
the
hand
sheremetieff
inquired
after
his
own
parisian
friend
and
golovin
asked
him
to
dinner
others
followed
his
example
so
that
ibrahim
received
invitations
for
at
least
a
whole
month
his
life
was
now
passed
in
regular
but
active
occupation
consequently
he
was
not
dull
prom
day
to
day
he
became
more
attached
to
the
tsar
and
grew
better
able
to
appreciate
his
lofty
character
the
thoughts
of
a
great
man
are
a
most
interesting
study
ibrahim
saw
peter
in
the
senate
debating
with
buturlin
and
dolgoruki
discussing
important
questions
in
the
admiralty
fostering
the
russian
navy
in
his
leisure
with
theophan
gavril
bujinski
and
kopievitch
examining
translations
from
foreign
publications
or
visiting
a
factory
an
artizan
workshop
or
the
study
of
some
learned
man
russia
became
to
ibrahim
one
vast
workshop
where
machinery
alone
moved
where
each
workman
under
ordered
rules
is
occupied
with
his
own
task
he
felt
that
he
too
must
work
at
his
own
bench
and
tried
to
regret
as
little
as
possible
the
amusements
of
his
parisian
life
but
if
was
hander
to
forget
a
dearer
memory
often
he
thought
of
countess
her
just
indignation
her
tears
and
grief
at
times
a
terrible
thought
oppressed
him
the
distractions
of
society
new
ties
another
favourite
he
shuddered
jealousy
began
to
rage
in
his
african
blood
and
burning
tears
were
ready
to
flow
down
his
swarthy
face
one
morning
he
was
sitting
in
his
study
amid
official
documents
when
he
heard
himself
loudly
greeted
in
french
turning
quickly
round
he
was
embraced
with
joyous
exclamations
by
young
korsakoff
whom
he
had
left
in
paris
in
the
whirl
of
the
great
world
i
have
only
just
arrived
said
korsakoff
and
came
straight
to
you
all
our
parisian
friends
desire
to
be
remembered
to
you
and
regret
your
absence
the
countess
requested
me
to
invite
you
without
fail
and
here
is
her
letter
for
you
ibrahim
seized
it
eagerly
and
was
looking
at
the
familiar
writing
on
the
envelope
scarcely
believing
his
own
eyes
how
glad
i
am
added
korsakoff
that
you
have
not
been
bored
to
death
in
this
barbarous
petersburg
how
do
they
manage
here
what
do
they
do
who
is
your
tailor
have
they
started
an
opera
ibrahim
absently
replied
that
the
tsar
was
probably
at
that
moment
at
work
in
the
shipping
dock
korsakoff
laughed
i
see
he
said
you
are
preoccupied
and
do
want
me
just
now
another
time
we
will
have
a
good
talk
i
am
off
to
present
my
respects
to
his
majesty
with
these
words
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
hurried
out
of
the
room
left
alone
ibrahim
quickly
opened
the
letter
the
countess
complained
tenderly
reproached
him
with
falseness
and
inconstancy
you
used
to
say
she
wrote
that
my
happiness
was
more
to
you
than
all
the
world
ibrahim
if
this
were
true
could
you
have
left
me
in
the
state
to
which
the
sudden
news
of
your
departure
brought
me
you
were
afraid
i
might
detain
you
be
assured
that
in
spite
of
my
love
i
should
have
known
how
to
sacrifice
it
for
your
good
and
to
what
you
deem
your
duty
the
countess
ended
with
passionate
assurances
of
love
begging
him
to
write
if
only
occasionally
and
even
if
there
were
no
hope
that
they
would
ever
meet
again
ibrahim
read
and
this
letter
twenty
times
rapturously
kissing
those
precious
lines
burning
with
impatience
for
news
about
the
countess
he
set
out
for
the
admiralty
hoping
to
find
his
friend
still
there
when
the
door
opened
and
korsakoff
he
had
seen
the
tsar
and
he
seemed
as
usual
perfectly
between
ourselves
he
said
to
ibrahim
the
tsar
is
a
most
extraordinary
man
fancy
i
found
him
in
a
sort
of
linen
vest
on
the
mast
of
a
new
ship
whither
i
had
to
scramble
with
my
dispatches
i
stood
on
a
rope
ladder
and
had
not
room
enough
to
make
a
proper
bow
i
lost
my
presence
of
mind
for
the
first
time
in
all
my
life
however
the
tsar
when
he
had
read
my
papers
looked
at
me
from
head
to
foot
ho
doubt
he
was
agreeably
impressed
by
my
good
taste
and
splendid
attire
at
any
rate
he
smiled
and
invited
me
to
the
assembly
today
but
i
am
a
perfect
stranger
in
petersburg
for
my
six
years
absence
i
have
quite
forgotten
the
local
customs
please
be
my
mentor
call
for
me
on
your
way
and
introduce
me
ibrahim
promised
and
hastened
to
turn
the
conversation
on
the
subject
that
most
interested
him
how
was
the
countess
the
countess
at
first
she
was
naturally
most
unhappy
at
your
departure
then
of
course
by
degrees
she
grew
reconciled
and
took
to
herself
another
lover
who
do
you
think
the
lanky
marquis
why
do
you
open
those
african
eyes
of
yours
does
this
appear
to
you
so
strange
do
you
know
that
enduring
grief
is
not
in
human
nature
particularly
in
a
woman
meditate
duly
upon
that
while
i
go
and
rest
after
my
journey
and
do
forget
to
call
for
me
on
your
way
what
terrible
thoughts
crowded
ibrahim
soul
jealousy
rage
despair
ho
but
a
deep
crushing
sorrow
he
murmured
to
himself
i
foresaw
it
it
was
bound
to
happen
then
he
opened
the
countess
letter
read
it
over
again
hung
his
head
and
wept
bitterly
long
did
he
weep
those
tears
relieved
him
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
found
that
it
was
time
to
start
gladly
would
he
have
stayed
away
but
the
party
was
an
affair
of
duty
and
the
tsar
was
strict
in
exacting
the
attendance
of
those
attached
to
him
he
dressed
and
started
to
fetch
korsakoff
korsakoff
was
sitting
in
his
dressing
gown
reading
a
french
book
so
early
he
exclaimed
seeing
ibrahim
excuse
me
the
other
replied
it
already
five
we
shall
be
late
make
haste
and
dress
and
let
us
go
korsakoff
hurriedly
rang
the
bell
with
all
his
might
the
servants
hurried
in
and
he
began
hastily
to
dress
his
french
valet
handed
him
slippers
with
red
heels
light
blue
velvet
breeches
a
pink
kaftan
embroidered
with
spangles
in
the
antechamber
his
wig
was
hurriedly
powdered
and
brought
in
korsakoff
pushed
into
it
his
closely
cropped
head
asked
for
his
sword
and
gloves
turned
ten
times
before
the
glass
and
announced
to
ibrahim
that
he
was
ready
the
footmen
handed
them
their
bearskin
overcoats
and
they
drove
off
to
the
winter
palace
korsakoff
smothered
ibrahim
with
questions
who
was
the
belle
of
petersburg
which
man
was
considered
the
best
dancer
and
which
dance
was
the
most
fashionable
ibrahim
very
reluctantly
gratified
his
curiosity
meanwhile
they
reached
the
palace
a
number
of
long
sledges
old
carriages
and
gilded
coaches
stood
on
the
lawn
near
the
steps
were
crowded
coachmen
in
livery
and
moustaches
outriders
glittering
with
tinsel
with
feathers
and
maces
hussars
pages
and
awkward
footmen
carrying
their
masters
furcoats
and
muffs
a
following
indispensable
according
to
the
notions
of
the
gentry
of
that
period
at
sight
of
ibrahim
a
general
murmur
ran
the
negro
the
negro
the
tzar
negro
he
hurriedly
led
korsakoff
through
this
motley
crowd
the
court
footman
opened
wide
the
doors
and
they
entered
a
large
room
korsakoff
was
dumb
with
astonishment
in
this
big
hall
lighted
up
with
tallow
candles
dimly
burning
amidst
clouds
of
tobacco
smoke
sat
magnates
with
blue
ribbons
across
their
shoulders
ambassadors
foreign
merchants
officers
of
the
guards
in
their
green
uniform
shipbuilders
in
jackets
and
striped
trousers
all
moving
to
and
fro
in
crowds
to
the
unceasing
sound
of
sacred
music
the
ladies
sat
near
to
the
walls
the
young
attired
in
all
the
splendour
of
fashion
gold
and
silver
shone
upon
their
gowns
from
the
midst
of
wide
crinolines
their
slender
figures
rose
like
flower
stalks
diamonds
glittered
in
their
ears
in
their
long
curls
and
round
their
neck
they
turned
gaily
to
the
right
and
left
awaiting
the
gentlemen
and
the
dancing
elderly
ladies
tried
cunningly
to
combine
the
new
style
of
dress
with
the
vanished
past
caps
were
modelled
on
the
small
sable
hat
of
the
tsaritsa
natalia
kirilovna
and
gowns
and
mantles
somehow
recalled
the
sarafan
and
dushegreika
short
jacket
without
sleeves
they
seemed
to
share
rather
with
wonder
than
enjoyment
in
these
new
imported
amusements
and
glanced
angrily
at
the
wives
and
daughters
of
the
dutch
skippers
who
in
cotton
skirts
and
red
jackets
knitted
their
stockings
and
sat
laughing
and
talking
quite
at
ease
amongst
themselves
seeing
the
fresh
arrivals
a
servant
approached
with
beer
and
tumblers
on
a
tray
korsakoff
in
bewilderment
whispered
to
ibrahim
que
diable
est
ce
que
tout
cela
ibrahim
could
not
repress
a
smile
the
empress
and
the
grand
duchess
radiant
in
their
own
beauty
and
their
attire
walked
through
the
rows
of
guests
talking
affably
to
them
the
emperor
was
in
another
room
korsakoff
wishing
to
show
himself
to
him
with
difficulty
pushed
his
way
through
the
crowd
sitting
in
that
room
were
mostly
foreigners
solemnly
smoking
their
clay
pipes
and
drinking
from
their
earthen
jugs
on
the
tables
were
bottles
of
beer
and
wine
leather
pouches
with
tobacco
tumblers
of
punch
and
a
few
at
one
of
these
was
peter
playing
draughts
with
a
english
skipper
they
solemnly
saluted
one
another
with
gulps
of
tobacco
smoke
and
the
tsar
was
so
engrossed
by
an
unexpected
move
of
his
opponent
that
he
did
not
notice
korsakoff
in
spite
of
the
latter
contortions
at
that
moment
a
stout
gentleman
with
a
large
bouquet
on
his
breast
rushed
in
announced
in
a
loud
voice
that
dancing
had
begun
and
instantly
retired
he
was
followed
by
a
large
number
of
the
guests
including
korsakoff
among
the
rest
the
unexpected
sight
surprised
him
along
the
whole
length
of
the
hall
to
the
sound
of
the
most
doleful
music
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
stood
in
two
rows
face
to
face
the
gentlemen
bowed
low
the
ladies
curtsied
lower
still
first
to
their
then
to
the
right
then
to
the
left
again
to
their
then
to
the
right
and
so
on
korsakoff
gazing
at
this
fantastic
pastime
opened
his
eyes
and
bit
his
lips
the
curtsying
and
bowing
went
on
for
about
half
an
hour
at
last
they
ended
and
the
stout
gentleman
with
the
bouquet
announced
that
the
dances
of
ceremony
were
ended
and
ordered
the
band
to
play
a
minuet
korsakoff
was
delighted
and
made
ready
to
show
off
among
the
young
ladies
was
one
whom
he
particularly
admired
she
was
about
sixteen
dressed
richly
but
with
taste
and
sat
next
an
elderly
gentleman
of
dignified
and
stern
appearance
korsakoff
rushed
up
to
her
and
begged
the
honour
of
a
dance
the
young
beauty
was
disconcerted
and
seemed
to
be
at
a
loss
what
to
say
the
man
sitting
next
her
frowned
more
than
before
korsakoff
awaited
her
reply
when
the
gentleman
with
the
bouquet
approached
led
him
to
the
middle
of
the
hall
and
said
pompously
dear
sip
you
have
done
wrong
in
the
first
place
you
approached
this
young
person
without
first
rendering
her
the
three
requisite
salutes
and
secondly
you
took
upon
yourself
the
right
of
choosing
her
whereas
in
the
minuet
that
privilege
is
hers
and
not
the
gentleman
for
this
you
must
undergo
severe
punishment
that
is
you
must
drain
the
goblet
of
the
great
eagle
korsakoff
from
hour
to
hour
grew
more
astonished
in
a
moment
the
guests
surrounded
him
loudly
demanding
instant
compliance
with
the
law
peter
hearing
the
laughter
and
loud
talk
came
from
the
next
room
being
very
fond
of
witnessing
such
punishments
the
crowd
divided
before
him
and
he
stepped
into
the
centre
where
stood
the
accused
with
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
before
him
holding
an
enormous
cup
full
of
malmsey
wine
he
was
earnestly
persuading
the
culprit
to
submit
willingly
to
the
law
aha
said
peter
seeing
korsakoff
you
are
caught
brother
drink
monsieur
and
no
wry
faces
there
was
nothing
for
it
the
poor
dandy
without
stopping
drained
the
goblet
and
returned
it
to
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
hark
korsakoff
said
peter
your
breeches
are
of
velvet
the
like
even
i
do
wear
who
am
much
richer
than
you
that
is
extravagance
take
care
i
do
not
quarrel
with
you
after
this
rebuke
korsakoff
wished
to
leave
the
circle
but
staggered
and
nearly
fell
to
the
great
delight
of
the
emperor
and
the
merry
company
this
incident
not
only
did
not
mar
the
harmony
nor
interest
of
the
principal
entertainment
but
on
the
contrary
enlivened
it
the
gentlemen
began
to
scrape
and
bow
and
the
ladies
to
curtsy
and
knock
their
little
heels
together
with
great
diligence
no
longer
keeping
time
to
the
music
korsakoff
could
not
share
in
the
general
merriment
by
her
father
gavril
afanassievitch
rjevski
orders
the
lady
whom
korsakoff
had
chosen
approached
ibrahim
and
dropping
her
eyes
timidly
held
out
her
hand
to
him
ibrahim
danced
the
minuet
with
her
and
led
her
back
to
her
seat
then
went
in
search
of
korsakoff
led
him
out
of
the
hall
placed
him
in
the
carriage
and
drove
him
home
at
the
beginning
of
the
journey
korsakoff
mumbled
curses
upon
the
soiree
and
the
goblet
of
the
great
eagle
but
he
soon
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
he
knew
not
how
he
got
home
undressed
and
was
put
to
bed
and
he
awoke
next
day
with
a
headache
and
a
dim
remembrance
of
the
scraping
curtseying
and
tobacco
smoke
the
gentleman
with
the
enormous
bouquet
and
the
mighty
goblet
of
the
great
eagle
chapter
iv
verse
from
ruslan
and
ludmila
our
forefathers
were
leisurely
souls
right
leisurely
did
they
dine
and
they
ladled
slow
from
their
silver
bowls
the
foaming
beer
and
wine
i
must
introduce
you
gracious
reader
to
gavril
afanassievitch
rjevski
he
came
of
an
ancient
noble
race
owned
vast
estates
was
hospitable
loved
falconry
had
an
enormous
retinue
and
was
in
a
word
a
good
old
russian
gentleman
in
his
own
words
he
could
not
bear
anything
foreign
and
in
his
home
he
tried
to
maintain
the
customs
of
the
good
old
days
he
loved
so
well
his
daughter
was
seventeen
in
childhood
she
had
lost
her
mother
and
she
had
been
brought
up
in
the
way
amid
a
crowd
of
governesses
nurses
companions
and
children
from
the
servants
hall
she
could
embroider
in
gold
and
was
illiterate
her
father
in
spite
of
his
dislike
to
all
things
foreign
could
not
oppose
her
wish
to
learn
german
dances
from
a
captive
swedish
officer
living
in
their
house
this
worthy
dancing
master
was
about
fifty
his
right
foot
had
been
shot
through
at
the
battle
of
narva
and
therefore
it
was
not
very
active
at
minuets
and
courantes
but
the
left
was
very
dexterous
and
agile
in
the
more
difficult
steps
his
young
pupil
did
credit
to
his
teaching
natalia
gavrilovna
was
celebrated
at
these
soirees
for
her
dancing
which
was
partly
the
cause
of
korsakoff
proceedings
he
came
next
morning
to
apologise
to
gavril
afanassievitch
but
the
young
dandy
manner
and
fine
dress
displeased
the
proud
who
nicknamed
him
the
french
monkey
it
was
a
holiday
gavril
afanassievitch
expected
a
number
of
friends
and
relations
in
the
ancient
hall
a
long
table
was
being
laid
the
guests
were
arriving
with
their
wives
and
daughters
who
had
at
last
been
released
from
their
domestic
prison
by
the
order
and
by
the
example
of
the
tsar
natalia
gavrilovna
handed
round
a
silver
tray
laden
with
golden
cups
and
each
guest
as
he
drained
one
regretted
that
the
kiss
which
accompanied
it
on
such
occasions
in
olden
times
was
out
of
fashion
they
sat
down
to
table
in
the
place
of
honour
next
the
host
sat
his
prince
boris
alexeievitch
lykoff
a
boyar
in
his
seventieth
year
the
other
guests
were
placed
in
order
of
descent
and
thus
recalling
the
happy
times
of
precedence
by
office
sat
down
men
on
one
side
women
on
the
other
at
the
end
of
the
table
the
companion
in
the
dress
a
dwarf
a
infant
affected
and
wrinkled
and
the
captive
dancing
master
in
a
shabby
dark
blue
uniform
took
their
accustomed
seats
the
table
covered
with
a
great
number
of
dishes
was
surrounded
by
numerous
and
busy
servants
distinguishable
among
whom
was
the
butler
with
severe
mien
big
stomach
and
pompous
immobility
the
first
few
moments
of
dinner
were
devoted
entirely
to
the
dishes
of
our
russian
cookery
the
rattle
of
plates
and
the
activity
of
spoons
produced
a
general
taciturnity
at
last
the
host
perceiving
that
the
time
had
come
for
entertaining
the
guests
with
agreeable
conversation
turned
and
asked
where
then
is
ekimovna
let
her
be
summoned
several
attendants
were
about
to
rush
off
in
different
directions
when
an
old
woman
painted
white
and
pink
decorated
with
flowers
and
tinsel
in
a
silk
damask
gown
with
a
low
neck
entered
singing
and
dancing
her
advent
occasioned
general
delight
to
you
ekimovna
said
prince
lykoff
how
are
you
getting
on
well
and
healthily
gossip
all
night
dancing
my
suitors
awaiting
where
have
you
been
fool
asked
the
host
dressing
gossip
to
receive
the
dear
guests
on
the
lord
festival
by
order
of
the
tsar
by
command
of
the
master
to
the
derision
of
the
world
in
the
german
style
at
these
words
there
was
a
loud
burst
of
laughter
and
the
jester
took
her
place
behind
the
host
chair
and
folly
talks
foolishly
and
sometimes
tells
the
truth
in
her
folly
said
tatiana
afanassievna
eldest
sister
of
the
host
and
much
respected
by
him
naturally
the
present
style
of
dress
must
seem
ridiculous
to
everybody
when
you
my
friends
have
shaved
your
beards
and
put
on
a
short
coat
it
is
of
course
no
use
talking
of
rags
but
really
it
is
a
pity
the
sarafan
the
maiden
ribbons
and
the
povoinik
a
should
be
discarded
it
is
really
sad
and
comic
to
see
the
beauties
of
their
hair
frizzed
like
flax
greased
and
covered
with
french
powder
the
waist
laced
in
so
tight
that
it
seems
on
the
point
of
snapping
their
bodies
encased
in
hoops
so
that
they
have
to
go
sideways
through
a
carriage
door
they
stoop
they
can
neither
stand
sit
nor
breathe
real
martyrs
my
poor
dears
dear
mother
tatiana
afanassievna
said
kirila
petrovitch
formerly
a
at
riasan
where
he
acquired
serfs
and
a
young
wife
neither
by
strictly
honourable
means
but
my
wife
may
dress
as
she
likes
as
long
as
she
does
not
order
new
gowns
every
month
and
throw
away
the
previous
ones
while
still
quite
perfectly
new
formerly
the
granddaughter
included
in
her
dowry
the
grandmother
sarafan
but
now
you
see
the
mistress
in
a
gown
and
it
is
on
the
maid
what
is
to
be
done
nothing
but
ruin
confronts
the
russian
noble
very
sad
he
said
with
a
sigh
looking
at
his
maria
ilienitchna
who
seemed
to
like
neither
his
praise
of
olden
times
nor
his
disparagement
of
the
latest
fashions
the
rest
of
the
ladies
shared
her
displeasure
but
they
said
nothing
for
modesty
was
in
those
days
still
deemed
essential
in
young
women
and
who
is
to
blame
asked
gravril
afanassievitch
frothing
a
mug
of
sort
of
lemonade
is
it
not
our
own
fault
the
young
women
play
the
fool
and
we
encourage
them
what
can
we
do
we
can
not
help
ourselves
replied
kirila
petrovitch
a
man
would
gladly
shut
his
wife
up
in
the
house
but
she
is
summoned
with
beating
of
drums
to
attend
the
assemblies
the
husband
follows
the
whip
but
the
wife
runs
after
dress
oh
those
assemblies
the
lord
has
sent
them
upon
us
to
punish
us
for
our
sins
maria
ilienitchna
sat
on
needles
her
tongue
itched
at
last
she
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
turning
to
her
husband
inquired
with
a
little
acid
smile
what
he
found
to
object
to
in
the
assemblies
this
is
what
i
find
to
object
to
replied
the
irritated
husband
since
they
began
husbands
can
not
manage
their
wives
wives
have
forgotten
the
teaching
of
the
apostles
that
a
wife
shall
reverence
her
husband
they
trouble
themselves
not
about
their
domestic
affairs
but
about
new
apparel
they
consider
not
how
to
please
the
husband
but
how
to
attract
the
officers
and
is
it
becoming
madam
for
a
russian
lady
wife
or
maid
to
hobnob
with
german
tobacconists
and
with
their
workmen
who
ever
heard
of
dancing
till
night
and
talking
with
young
men
if
they
were
relatives
all
well
and
good
but
with
strangers
and
with
men
they
do
not
know
i
would
say
a
word
but
there
is
a
wolf
near
said
gavril
afanassievitch
with
a
frown
i
confess
these
assemblies
are
not
to
my
taste
at
any
moment
you
may
jostle
against
a
drunken
man
or
perhaps
be
made
drunk
yourself
to
amuse
others
then
there
is
the
danger
that
some
blackguard
may
be
up
to
mischief
with
your
daughter
the
modern
young
men
are
so
spoilt
it
is
disgraceful
take
for
instance
the
son
of
the
late
evgraff
sergueievitch
korsakoff
who
at
the
last
assembly
made
such
a
fuss
about
natasha
that
he
brought
the
blood
into
my
cheeks
next
day
he
coolly
drives
up
to
my
gate
i
was
wondering
whether
it
could
be
prince
alexander
danilovitch
no
such
luck
ivan
evgrafovitch
he
would
not
stop
at
the
gate
and
take
the
trouble
to
walk
up
to
the
door
it
is
not
likely
korsakoff
rushed
in
bowing
and
scraping
and
chattered
at
such
a
rate
the
lord
preserve
us
the
fool
ekimovna
mimics
him
most
comically
fool
give
us
the
foreign
monkey
foolish
ekimovna
seized
the
cover
off
a
dish
tucked
it
under
her
arm
like
a
hat
and
began
wriggling
scraping
with
her
feet
and
bowing
in
all
directions
saying
general
and
prolonged
laughter
again
showed
the
delight
of
the
guests
exactly
like
korsakoff
said
old
prince
lykoff
wiping
away
his
tears
of
laughter
when
the
noise
had
gradually
subsided
it
must
be
owned
however
he
is
not
the
first
nor
the
last
who
has
come
from
foreign
parts
to
holy
russia
a
buffoon
what
do
our
children
learn
abroad
to
scrape
their
feet
to
chatter
the
lord
knows
what
lingo
not
to
respect
their
elders
and
to
dangle
after
other
men
wives
of
all
the
young
people
who
have
been
educated
abroad
the
lord
forgive
me
the
negro
most
resembles
a
man
oh
prince
said
tatiana
afanassievna
i
have
i
have
seen
him
close
what
a
frightful
muzzle
he
has
i
was
quite
frightened
of
him
certainly
added
gavril
afanassievitch
he
is
a
steady
decent
man
not
a
brother
of
the
whirlwind
who
is
it
that
has
just
driven
through
the
gate
into
the
courtyard
surely
it
is
never
that
foreign
monkey
again
what
are
you
animals
doing
he
exclaimed
turning
towards
the
servants
run
and
keep
him
out
and
never
let
him
in
again
old
beard
are
you
dreaming
foolish
ekimovna
interrupted
are
you
blind
it
is
the
royal
sledge
the
tsar
has
come
gavril
afanassievitch
rose
hurriedly
from
the
table
everybody
rushed
to
the
windows
and
positively
saw
the
emperor
ascending
the
steps
leaning
on
the
arm
of
his
orderly
there
was
a
great
commotion
the
host
rushed
to
meet
peter
the
servants
flew
hither
and
thither
as
if
mad
the
guests
were
alarmed
and
some
wondered
how
they
might
escape
suddenly
the
thunder
voice
of
peter
resounded
in
the
hall
all
was
silence
as
the
tsar
entered
accompanied
by
his
host
in
a
flutter
of
joy
how
do
you
do
ladies
and
gentlemen
said
peter
gaily
all
made
obeisance
the
tsar
sharp
eyes
sought
in
this
crowd
the
host
young
daughter
he
beckoned
to
her
natalia
gavrilovna
approached
rather
boldly
but
blushed
not
only
to
her
ears
but
to
her
shoulders
you
grow
prettier
every
hour
said
the
tsar
and
according
to
his
custom
kissed
her
on
the
head
then
turning
to
the
guests
he
exclaimed
why
i
have
interrupted
you
you
were
dining
i
beg
you
will
sit
down
again
and
to
me
gavril
afanassievitch
give
some
aniseed
vodka
the
host
rushed
at
the
stately
butler
snatched
from
him
a
tray
and
himself
filling
a
small
golden
goblet
handed
it
to
the
tsar
peter
drank
it
ate
a
piece
of
bread
and
again
invited
the
guests
to
continue
their
dinner
all
resumed
their
seats
but
the
dwarf
and
the
companion
who
did
not
dare
to
remain
at
the
table
honoured
by
the
presence
of
the
monarch
peter
sat
down
beside
the
host
and
asked
for
some
shtchee
a
cabbage
soup
the
tsar
orderly
handed
him
a
wooden
spoon
inlaid
with
ivory
a
knife
and
fork
with
green
bone
handles
peter
never
used
any
others
but
his
own
the
dinner
table
conversation
which
a
moment
before
had
been
boisterously
merry
ended
by
being
forced
and
scanty
the
host
from
respect
and
delight
ate
nothing
the
guests
too
became
ceremonious
and
listened
with
reverence
to
the
tsar
as
he
discussed
in
german
the
campaign
of
with
the
captive
swede
the
fool
ekimovna
several
times
interrogated
by
the
monarch
replied
with
a
sort
of
cold
timidity
which
did
not
in
the
least
prove
her
natural
folly
at
last
the
dinner
ended
the
monarch
rose
and
after
him
all
the
guests
gavril
afanassievitch
he
said
addressing
the
host
i
want
a
word
with
you
alone
taking
his
arm
he
led
him
into
the
and
locked
the
door
the
guests
remaining
in
the
whispered
about
the
unexpected
visit
and
fearing
to
intrude
dispersed
speedily
without
expressing
to
their
host
the
usual
thanks
his
daughter
and
sister
accompanied
each
in
silence
to
the
door
and
remained
alone
in
the
awaiting
his
departure
chapter
half
an
hour
later
the
door
opened
and
peter
came
out
with
a
solemn
bow
to
the
treble
salute
from
prince
lykoff
tatiana
afanassievna
and
natasha
he
passed
out
into
the
lobby
the
host
handed
him
his
long
red
overcoat
conducted
him
to
the
sledge
and
on
the
door
steps
again
thanked
him
for
the
honour
he
had
done
him
peter
drove
off
returning
to
the
gavril
afanassievitch
seemed
much
troubled
angrily
bade
the
servants
clear
the
table
sent
natasha
to
her
apartments
and
informed
his
sister
and
that
he
must
talk
with
them
he
led
them
into
the
bedroom
where
he
usually
took
his
nap
the
old
prince
lay
down
upon
the
oak
bed
tatiana
afanassievna
sat
down
upon
the
ancient
damask
easy
chair
and
drew
the
footstool
towards
her
gavril
afanassievitch
locked
all
the
doors
and
sat
down
at
prince
lykoffs
feet
in
a
low
voice
he
began
the
tzar
had
a
reason
for
coming
here
guess
what
it
was
how
can
we
know
dear
brother
replied
tatiana
afanassievna
has
he
commanded
you
to
a
voievod
asked
his
it
is
time
he
did
so
long
ago
or
he
has
proposed
a
mission
to
you
why
not
not
always
clerks
important
people
are
sometimes
sent
to
foreign
monarchs
no
replied
his
scowling
i
am
a
man
of
the
old
pattern
our
services
are
not
required
in
the
present
day
though
perhaps
an
orthodox
russian
nobleman
is
superior
to
modern
upstarts
pancake
hawkers
and
mussulmen
but
that
is
a
different
matter
then
what
was
it
brother
asked
tatiana
afanassievna
crossing
herself
the
maiden
is
ready
for
marriage
the
bridegroom
must
be
in
keeping
with
the
proposer
god
grant
them
love
and
discretion
of
honour
there
is
plenty
on
whose
behalf
then
does
the
tzar
propose
hum
whose
indeed
exclaimed
gavril
afanassievitch
whose
that
is
just
the
point
whose
repeated
prince
lykoff
half
dozing
already
guess
said
gavril
afanassievitch
dear
brother
replied
the
old
lady
how
can
we
guess
there
are
many
gentlemen
at
court
any
one
of
them
would
be
delighted
to
marry
your
natasha
is
it
dolgoruki
no
not
dolgoruki
the
lord
be
with
him
he
is
so
haughty
shein
troekuroff
neither
of
them
i
do
care
for
them
either
they
are
flighty
and
too
german
then
it
is
miloslavsky
no
not
he
god
be
with
him
he
is
rich
and
stupid
who
then
is
it
eletsky
lvof
it
can
not
be
ragusinski
well
i
can
not
imagine
then
whom
does
the
tzar
wish
natasha
to
marry
the
negro
ibrahim
the
old
lady
exclaimed
and
threw
up
her
arms
prince
lykoff
raised
his
head
from
the
pillows
and
in
astonishment
repeated
the
negro
ibrahim
dear
brother
said
the
old
lady
in
a
voice
full
of
tears
do
not
destroy
your
darling
daughter
do
not
deliver
natashinka
into
the
claws
of
the
black
devil
but
how
then
replied
gavril
afanassievitch
refuse
the
tzar
who
in
return
promises
us
his
protection
to
me
and
all
our
house
what
exclaimed
the
old
prince
who
was
wide
awake
now
natasha
my
granddaughter
to
be
married
to
a
bought
negro
he
of
good
birth
said
gavril
afanassievitch
he
is
the
son
of
a
negro
sultan
he
was
not
taken
prisoner
by
the
mussulmen
but
sold
at
constantinople
our
ambassador
bought
him
and
presented
him
to
peter
the
negro
eldest
brother
came
to
russia
with
a
handsome
ransom
and
we
have
the
legend
of
bova
koroleviteh
and
eruslana
lasarevitch
gavril
afanassievitch
added
the
old
lady
tell
us
rather
how
you
replied
to
the
tzar
proposal
i
said
that
he
was
in
authority
over
us
and
that
it
was
our
duty
to
submit
to
him
in
everything
at
that
moment
a
noise
was
heard
behind
the
door
gavril
afanassievitch
went
to
open
it
but
something
obstructed
he
gave
a
hard
push
the
door
opened
and
he
beheld
natasha
unconscious
lying
on
the
floor
her
heart
misgave
her
when
the
tzar
was
closeted
with
her
father
a
sort
of
presentiment
whispered
to
her
that
the
matter
concerned
her
and
when
gavril
afanassievitch
bade
her
to
retire
while
he
conferred
with
her
aunt
and
grandfather
she
could
not
resist
feminine
curiosity
crawled
quietly
through
the
back
rooms
to
the
bedroom
door
and
missed
no
word
of
their
terrible
conversation
when
she
heard
her
last
sentence
the
poor
girl
fainted
and
falling
struck
her
head
against
the
chest
which
held
her
dowry
the
servants
rushed
in
lifted
natasha
carried
her
to
her
own
suite
of
apartments
and
laid
her
upon
her
bed
after
a
little
she
came
to
and
opened
her
eyes
but
recognised
neither
father
nor
aunt
fever
set
in
in
her
delirium
she
spoke
of
marriage
and
the
tzar
negro
and
suddenly
cried
in
a
plaintive
and
piercing
voice
valerian
dear
valerian
my
life
save
me
there
they
are
there
they
are
tatiana
afanassievna
glanced
anxiously
at
her
brother
who
turned
white
bit
his
lip
and
left
the
room
in
silence
he
returned
to
the
old
prince
who
unable
to
mount
the
stairs
had
remained
below
how
is
natasha
he
asked
poorly
replied
the
sad
father
worse
than
i
thought
in
her
delirium
she
raves
about
valerian
who
is
this
valerian
inquired
the
anxious
old
man
can
it
be
the
orphan
son
of
the
musketeer
whom
you
brought
up
in
your
house
the
same
to
my
sorrow
replied
gavril
afanassievitch
his
father
saved
my
life
during
the
insurrection
and
the
devil
induced
me
to
take
home
the
accursed
young
wolf
two
years
ago
at
his
own
request
he
was
drafted
into
the
army
natasha
cried
at
parting
with
him
while
he
stood
as
if
turned
to
stone
i
thought
it
suspicious
and
spoke
to
my
sister
about
it
but
natasha
has
never
mentioned
him
since
and
nothing
has
been
heard
of
him
i
hoped
she
had
forgotten
him
but
it
seems
not
i
have
decided
she
shall
marry
the
negro
prince
lykoff
did
not
contradict
him
it
would
have
been
useless
he
returned
home
tatiana
afanassievna
remained
by
natasha
bedside
gavril
afanassievitch
after
sending
for
the
doctor
locked
himself
in
his
own
room
and
in
his
house
all
was
still
and
sad
this
unexpected
proposal
of
marriage
surprised
ibrahim
at
any
rate
quite
as
much
as
it
surprised
gavril
afanassievitch
it
happened
thus
peter
while
busy
at
work
with
ibrahim
said
to
him
i
have
remarked
my
friend
that
you
are
tell
me
frankly
what
it
is
you
want
ibrahim
assured
the
tsar
that
he
was
contented
with
his
lot
and
wished
for
nothing
better
good
said
the
monarch
if
you
are
sad
without
a
cause
then
i
know
how
to
cheer
you
at
the
conclusion
of
their
work
peter
inquired
of
ibrahim
do
you
admire
the
young
lady
with
whom
you
danced
the
minuet
at
the
last
ball
sire
she
is
very
nice
and
seems
a
modest
amiable
girl
then
you
shall
make
her
more
intimate
acquaintance
should
you
like
to
marry
her
i
sire
listen
ibrahim
you
are
a
lonely
man
without
birth
or
clan
a
stranger
to
everybody
but
myself
if
i
were
to
die
what
would
become
of
you
my
poor
negro
you
must

i
am
contented
with
you
the
protection
and
favour
of
your
majesty

grant
i
may
not
survive
my
tsar
and
benefactor
i
desire
nothing
more
and
even
if
i
had
any
views
of
matrimony
would
the
young
girl
or
her
relations
consent
my
personal
appearance
your
personal
appearance
what
nonsense
how
are
you
not
a
fine
fellow
a
young
girl
must
obey
her
parent
wishes
but
we
will
see
what
old
gavril
rjevski
will
say
when
i
go
myself
as
your
matchmaker
with
these
words
the
tsar
ordered
his
sledge
and
left
ibrahim
wrapped
in
deep
meditation
marry
thought
the
african
and
why
not
surely
i
am
not
destined
to
pass
my
life
alone
and
never
know
the
greatest
happiness
and
the
most
sacred
duties
of
manhood
simply
because
i
was
born
in
the
torrid
zone
i
can
not
hope
to
be
loved
what
a
childish
thought
is
it
possible
to
believe
in
love
can
it
exist
in
the
frivolous
heart
of
woman
the
tsar
is
right
i
must
assure
my
own
future
marriage
with
young
rjevski
will
unite
me
to
the
haughty
russian
nobility
and
i
shall
cease
to
be
a
stranger
in
my
new
country
from
my
wife
i
shall
not
require
love
i
shall
content
myself
with
her
fidelity
and
friendship
ibrahim
wished
to
work
according
to
his
custom
but
his
imagination
was
too
excited
he
left
the
papers
and
went
out
to
stroll
along
the
banks
of
the
neva
suddenly
he
heard
peter
voice
looked
round
and
saw
the
tsar
who
had
dismissed
his
sledge
and
was
following
him
with
a
lively
countenance
it
is
all
settled
my
friend
said
peter
taking
him
by
the
arm
i
have
betrothed
you
tomorrow
call
upon
your
but
be
careful
to
honour
the
pride
of
the
leave
your
sledge
at
the
gates
and
go
across
the
yard
on
foot
talk
to
him
of
his
honours
and
distinction
and
he
will
be
delighted
with
you
and
now
he
added
shaking
his
cudgel
take
me
to
the
rogue
danileitch
with
whom
i
must
have
an
interview
about
his
latest
pranks
ibrahim
thanked
peter
most
sincerely
for
his
fatherly
care
accompanied
him
as
far
as
the
magnificent
mansion
of
prince
menshikoff
and
returned
home
chapter

gently
burnt
the
hanging
lamp
before
the
glass
case
wherein
glittered
the
gold
and
silver
frames
of
the
ancestral
the
flickering
light
lit
faintly
the
curtained
bed
and
the
table
strewn
with
labelled
phials
near
the
fireplace
sat
a
servant
at
her
spinning
wheel
and
only
the
light
sound
of
her
distaff
broke
the
silence
who
is
there
asked
a
weak
voice
the
maid
rose
instantly
approached
the
bed
and
quietly
raised
the
curtain
will
it
soon
be
dawn
asked
natalia
it
is
already
noon
replied
the
maid
oh
heavens
and
why
is
it
so
dark
the
shutters
are
closed
miss
then
let
me
dress
quickly
you
must
not
miss
the
doctor
forbids
it
am
i
ill
then
how
long
nearly
a
fortnight
now
is
it
really
so
and
it
seems
to
me
but
last
night
that
i
went
to
bed
natasha
was
silent
she
tried
to
collect
her
scattered
thoughts
something
had
happened
to
her
what
it
was
she
could
not
remember
the
maid
stood
before
her
awaiting
her
orders
at
that
moment
a
muffled
sound
was
heard
below
what
is
it
asked
the
patient
the
masters
have
finished
dinner
answered
the
attendant
they
are
rising
from
table
tatiana
afanassievna
will
be
here
directly
natasha
seemed
pleased
she
waved
her
feeble
hand
the
maid
dropped
the
curtain
and
resumed
her
seat
at
the
spinning
wheel
a
few
minutes
after
a
head
covered
with
a
broad
white
cap
with
dark
ribbons
peeped
through
the
door
and
asked
in
a
low
voice
how
is
natasha
how
do
you
do
auntie
said
the
invalid
gently
and
tatiana
afanassievna
hurried
towards
her
the
young
lady
is
conscious
said
the
maid
cautiously
moving
up
an
easy
chair
with
tears
in
her
eyes
the
old
lady
kissed
the
pale
languid
face
of
her
niece
and
sat
down
beside
her
immediately
after
her
came
the
german
doctor
in
a
black
caftan
and
learned
wig
he
counted
natalia
pulse
and
told
them
first
in
latin
then
in
russian
that
the
crisis
was
over
he
asked
for
paper
and
ink
wrote
a
new
prescription
and
departed
the
old
lady
rose
kissed
natalia
again
and
at
once
went
down
with
the
good
news
to
gavril
afanassievitch
in
the
in
full
uniform
with
sword
and
hat
in
hand
sat
the
royal
negro
talking
respectfully
with
gavril
afanassievitch
korsakoff
stretched
full
length
upon
a
downy
couch
reclined
listening
to
their
conversation
while
he
teased
the
greyhound
tired
of
this
occupation
he
approached
a
mirror
the
usual
refuge
of
the
idle
and
in
it
saw
tatiana
afanassievna
behind
the
door
making
unperceived
signs
to
her
brother
you
are
wanted
gavril
afanassievitch
said
korsakoff
to
him
interrupting
ibrahim
gavril
afanassievitch
instantly
went
to
his
sister
closing
the
door
behind
him
i
am
astonished
at
your
patience
said
korsakoff
to
ibrahim
a
whole
hour
have
you
been
listening
to
ravings
about
the
ancient
descent
of
the
lykoffs
and
the
rjevskis
and
have
even
added
your
own
moral
observations
in
your
place
plant√©
the
old
liar
and
all
his
race
including
natalia
gavrilovna
who
is
only
affected
and
shamming
illness
petite
tell
me
truly
is
it
possible
that
you
are
in
love
with
that
little
no
replied
ibrahim
i
am
of
course
marrying
not
from
love
but
from
consideration
and
that
only
if
she
has
no
actual
dislike
for
me
listen
ibrahim
said
korsakoff
for
once
take
my
advice
really
i
am
wiser
than
i
look
give
up
this
silly
idea
do
marry
it
seems
to
me
that
your
chosen
bride
has
no
particular
liking
for
you
many
things
happen
in
this
world
for
instance
of
course
i
am
not
bad
looking
but
it
has
happened
to
me
to
deceive
husbands
who
were
really
not
a
whit
my
inferior
yourself
too
you
remember
our
parisian
friend
count
a
woman
fidelity
can
not
be
counted
on
happy
is
he
who
can
bear
the
change
with
equanimity
but
you
with
your
passionate
brooding
and
suspicious
nature
with
your
flat
nose
thick
lips
is
it
with
these
that
you
propose
to
rush
into
all
the
dangers
of
matrimony
thank
you
for
your
friendly
advice
said
ibrahim
coldly
you
know
the
proverb
is
not
your
duty
to
rock
other
folk
children
take
care
ibrahim
replied
korsakoff
smiling
that
it
does
not
fall
to
your
lot
to
illustrate
that
proverb
literally
later
on
the
conversation
in
the
next
room
waxed
hot
you
will
kill
her
the
old
lady
was
saying
she
can
not
bear
the
sight
of
him
but
just
consider
replied
her
obstinate
brother
for
a
fortnight
now
he
has
been
calling
as
her
accepted
bridegroom
and
hitherto
has
not
seen
his
bride
he
might
think
at
last
that
her
illness
is
simply
an
invention
and
that
we
are
seeking
only
to
gain
time
in
order
to
get
rid
of
him
besides
what
will
the
tsar
say
he
has
already
sent
three
times
to
ask
after
natasha
do
as
you
please
but
i
do
not
intend
to
fall
out
with
him
my
god
exclaimed
tatiana
afanassievna
how
will
she
bear
it
at
any
rate
let
me
prepare
her
for
this
gavril
afanassievitch
consented
and
returned
to
the
thank
god
he
said
to
ibrahim
the
crisis
is
over
natalia
is
much
better
i
do
not
like
to
leave
our
dear
guest
korsakoff
here
alone
or
i
would
take
you
upstairs
to
get
a
glimpse
of
your
bride
korsakoff
congratulated
gavril
afanassievitch
begged
them
not
to
put
themselves
out
on
his
account
assured
them
that
he
was
obliged
to
go
and
rushed
into
the
lobby
whither
be
refused
to
allow
his
host
to
follow
him
meanwhile
tatiana
afanassievna
hastened
to
prepare
the
invalid
for
the
arrival
of
her
terrible
visitor
entering
the
apartments
she
sat
down
breathless
by
the
bedside
and
took
natalia
by
the
hand
but
before
she
had
time
to
say
a
word
the
door
opened
who
has
come
in
natasha
asked
the
old
lady
felt
faint
gavril
afanassievitch
drew
back
the
curtain
looked
coldly
at
the
patient
and
inquired
how
she
was
the
sick
girl
tried
to
smile
but
could
not
her
father
stern
gaze
startled
her
and
fear
overcame
her
she
fancied
some
one
stood
at
the
head
of
her
bed
with
an
effort
she
raised
her
head
and
instantly
recognised
the
negro
at
that
moment
she
remembered
all
and
all
the
horror
of
the
future
presented
itself
before
her
but
exhausted
nature
could
receive
no
further
perceptible
shock
natasha
dropped
her
head
back
on
the
pillow
and
closed
her
eyes
her
heart
within
her
gave
sickly
throbs
tatiana
afanassievna
signed
to
her
brother
that
the
patient
wanted
to
go
to
sleep
and
everybody
left
the
apartments
quietly
the
maid
alone
remained
and
resumed
her
seat
the
unhappy
beauty
opened
her
eyes
and
seeing
no
one
by
her
bedside
called
the
maid
and
sent
her
for
the
dwarf
but
at
that
moment
an
old
round
creature
like
a
ball
rolled
up
to
her
bed
tie
swallow
so
the
dwarf
was
nicknamed
had
rushed
as
fast
as
her
short
legs
would
carry
her
up
the
stairs
after
gavril
afanassievitch
and
ibrahim
and
hid
behind
the
door
natasha
saw
her
and
sent
the
maid
away
the
dwarf
sat
down
on
a
stool
by
the
bedside
never
had
so
small
a
body
contained
so
active
a
soul
she
interfered
in
everything
knew
everything
and
exerted
herself
about
everything
with
cunning
penetration
she
knew
how
to
gain
the
affection
of
her
masters
and
the
envy
of
all
the
household
over
which
she
wielded
autocratic
sway
gavril
afanassievitch
listened
to
her
tales
complaints
and
petty
requests
tatiana
afanassievna
asked
her
opinion
every
moment
and
took
her
advice
while
affection
for
her
was
unbounded
she
confided
to
her
all
the
thoughts
all
the
impulses
of
her
heart
do
you
know
swallow
she
said
my
father
is
going
to
marry
me
to
the
negro
the
dwarf
sighed
deeply
and
her
wrinkled
face
became
more
wrinkled
is
there
no
hope
added
natasha
do
you
think
my
father
will
not
have
compassion
upon
me
the
dwarf
shook
her
cap
wo
grandfather
intercede
for
me
or
my
aunt
no
miss
the
negro
during
your
illness
managed
to
bewitch
everybody
master
is
mad
about
him
the
prince
dreams
of
him
alone
and
tatiana
afanassievna
says
it
is
a
pity
he
is
a
negro
otherwise
we
could
not
wish
for
a
better
bridegroom
my
god
my
god
sobbed
poor
natasha
do
grieve
dear
beauty
said
the
dwarf
kissing
her
feeble
hand
if
you
must
marry
the
negro
at
any
rate
you
will
be
your
own
mistress
now
it
is
not
as
it
was
in
olden
times
husbands
no
longer
imprison
their
wives
the
negro
is
said
to
be
rich
the
house
will
be
like
a
full
cup
you
live
merrily
poor
valerian
said
natasha
but
so
low
that
the
dwarf
only
guessed
but
did
not
hear
the
words
that
is
just
it
miss
she
said
mysteriously
lowering
her
voice
if
you
thought
less
of
the
sharpshooter
orphan
you
would
not
rave
of
him
in
your
delirium
and
your
father
would
not
be
angry
what
inquired
natasha
in
alarm
i
raved
about
valerian
my
father
heard
my
father
was
angry
that
is
the
misfortune
replied
the
dwarf
now
if
you
ask
him
not
to
marry
you
to
the
negro
he
will
think
valerian
is
the
cause
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
you
had
better
submit
and
what
is
to
be
will
be
natasha
made
no
reply
the
notion
that
the
secret
of
her
heart
was
known
to
her
father
had
a
powerful
effect
upon
her
mind
one
hope
only
was
left
to
her
that
she
might
die
before
the
completion
of
this
hateful
marriage
this
idea
comforted
her
with
a
weak
and
sad
heart
she
resigned
herself
to
her
fate
chapter
vii
in
gavril
afanassievitch
house
opening
from
the
hall
on
the
right
was
a
a
narrow
room
with
one
window
in
it
stood
a
simple
bed
covered
with
a
blanket
before
the
bed
stood
a
small
table
of
pine
wood
on
which
a
tallow
candle
burnt
and
a
book
of
music
lay
open
on
the
wall
hung
an
old
blue
uniform
and
its
contemporary
a
hat
above
it
nailed
to
the
wall
with
three
nails
hung
a
picture
representing
charles
xii
on
horseback
the
notes
of
a
flute
sounded
through
this
humble
abode
the
captive
its
solitary
occupant
in
a
skull
cap
and
cotton
was
enlivening
the
dulness
of
a
evening
practising
some
strange
swedish
marches
after
devoting
two
whole
hours
to
this
exercise
the
swede
took
his
flute
to
pieces
packed
it
in
a
box
and
began
to
undress
the
gypsies
narrative
and
dramatic
poem
a
noisy
band
of
gypsies
are
wandering
through
bessarabia
they
will
pitch
their
ragged
tents
on
the
banks
of
the
river
sweet
as
freedom
is
their
nights
rest
peaceful
their
slumber
between
the
cart
wheels
half
screened
by
rugs
burns
a
fire
around
which
the
family
is
preparing
supper
in
the
open
fields
graze
the
horses
and
behind
the
tents
a
tame
bears
lies
free
in
the
heart
of
the
desert
all
is
movement
with
the
preparations
for
the
march
with
the
songs
of
the
women
the
cries
of
the
children
and
the
sound
of
the
itinerant
anvil
but
soon
upon
the
wandering
band
falls
the
silence
of
sleep
and
the
stillness
of
the
desert
is
broken
only
by
the
barking
of
the
dogs
and
the
neighing
of
the
horses
the
fires
are
everywhere
extinguished
all
is
calm
the
moon
shines
solitary
in
the
sky
shedding
its
light
over
the
silent
camp
in
one
of
the
tents
is
an
old
man
who
does
not
sleep
but
remains
seated
by
the
embers
warming
himself
by
their
last
glow
he
gazes
into
the
distant
steppes
which
are
now
wrapped
in
the
mists
of
night
his
youthful
daughter
has
wandered
into
the
distant
plains
she
is
accustomed
to
her
wild
freedom
she
will
return
but
night
wears
on
and
the
moon
in
the
distant
clouds
is
about
to
set
zemphira
tarries
and
the
old

is
getting
cold
but
here
she
comes
and
following
on
her
footsteps
a

make
trial
of
our
life
of
our
wandering
poverty
and
freedom
at
daybreak
in

gypsy
songs
are
mingled
with
the
growling
of
the
bear
impatiently
gnawing
at
his
chain
what
a
motley
of
rags
the
naked
children
the
aged
men
dogs
bark
and
howl
the
bagpipes
drone
the
carts
creak
all
is
so
poor
so
wild
so
disorderly
but
full
of
the
life
and
movement
ever
absent
from
our
dead
slothful
idle
life
monotonous
as
the
songs
of
slaves
the
youth
gazes
disheartened
over
the
desert
plain
the
secret
cause
of
his
sadness
he
admits
not
even
to
himself
by
his
side
is
the
zemphira
now
he
is
a
free
inhabitant
of
the
world
and
radiant
above
him
shines
the
sun
in
midday
glory
why
then
does
the
youth
heart
tremble
what
secret
sorrow
preys
upon
him
god
little
bird
knows
neither
care
nor
labour
why
should
it
strive
to
build
a
lasting
nest
the
night
is
long
but
a
branch
suffices
for
its
sleeping
place
when
the
sun
comes
in
his
glory
birdie
hears
the
voice
of
god
flutters
his
plumage
and
sings
his
song
after
spring
nature
fairest
time
comes
hot
summer
late
autumn
follows
bringing
mist
and
cold
poor
men
and
women
are
sad
and
dismal
to
distant
lands
to
warmer
climes
beyond
the
blue
sea
flies
birdie
to
the
spring
like
a
little
careless
bird
is
the
wandering
exile
for
him
there
is
no
abiding
nest
no
home
every
road
is
his
at
each
is
his
night
lodging
waking
at
dawn
he
leaves
his
day
at
god
disposal
and
the
toil
of
life
disturbs
not
his
calm
indolent
heart
at
times
glory
enchantment
like
a
distant
star
attracts
his
gaze
or
sudden
visions
of
luxury
and
pleasure
float
before
him
sometimes
above
his
solitary
head
growls
the
thunder
and
beneath
the
thunder
as
beneath
a
peaceful
sky
he
sleeps
serene
and
thus
he
lives
ignoring
the
power
of
blind
treacherous
fate
but
once
oh
god
how
passion
played
with
his
obedient
soul
how
it
raged
in
his
tormented
breast
is
it
long
and
for
how
long
that
it
has
left
him
calm
it
will
rage
again
let
him
but
wait
friend
tell
me
dost
thou
not
regret
what
thou
hast
left
for
ever
what
have
i
left
thou
knowest
thy
people
thy
cities
regret
if
thou
knewest
if
thou
imagine
the
confinement
of
our
stifling
towns
there
people
crowded
behind
walls
never
breathe
the
cool
breeze
of
the
morning
nor
the
breath
of
meadows
they
are
ashamed
to
love
and
chase
away
the
thought
they
traffic
with
liberty
bow
their
heads
to
idols
and
beg
for
money
and
chains
what
have
i
left
the
excitement
of
treason
the
prejudged
sentence
the
mob
mad
persecution
or
splendid
infamy
but
there
thou
hadst
magnificent
palaces
many
coloured
carpets
entertainments
and
loud
revels
and
the
maiden
dresses
are
so
rich
what
is
there
to
please
in
our
noisy
towns
the
genuine
love
no
veritable
joy
the
maidens
how
much
dost
thou
surpass
them
without
their
rich
apparel
their
pearls
or
their
necklaces
be
true
my
gentle
friend
my
sole
wish
is
to
share
with
thee
love
leisure
and
this
exile
old
gypsy
thou
lovest
us
though
born
amongst
the
but
freedom
is
not
always
agreeable
to
those
used
to
luxury
we
have
a
legend
once
a
king
banished
a
man
from
the
south
to
live
amongst
us
i
once
knew
but
have
forgotten
his
difficult
name
though
old
in
years
he
was
youthful
passionate
and
he
had
a
wondrous
gift
of
song
with
a
voice
like
running
waters
everyone
liked
him
he
dwelt
on
the
banks
of
the
danube
harming
no
one
but
pleasing
many
with
his
stories
he
was
helpless
weak
and
timid
as
a
child
strangers
brought
him
game
and
fish
caught
in
nets
when
the
rapid
river
froze
and
winter
storms
raged
high
they
clad
the
saintly
old
man
in
soft
warm
furs
but
he
could
never
be
inured
to
the
hardships
of
a
poor
life
he
wandered
about
pale
and
thin
declaring
that
an
offended
god
was
chastening
him
for
some
crime
he
waited
hoping
for
deliverance
and
full
of
sad
regret
the
wretched
man
wandered
on
the
banks
of
the
danube
shedding
bitter
tears
as
he
remembered
his
distant
home
and
dying
he
desired
that
his
unhappy
bones
should
be
carried
to
the
south
even
in
death
the
stranger
to
these
parts
could
find
no
rest
such
is
thy
children
fate
o
borne
o
empire
singer
of
love
singer
of
the
gods
say
what
is
glory
the
echo
from
the
tomb
the
voice
of
praise
continued
from
generation
to
generation
or
a
tale
told
by
a
gypsy
in
his
smoky
tent
two
years
passed
the
peaceful
gypsy
band
still
wanders
finding
everywhere
rest
and
hospitality
scorning
the
fetters
of
civilisation
aleko
is
free
like
them
without
regret
or
care
he
leads
a
wandering
life
he
is
unchanged
unchanged
the
gypsy
band
forgetful
of
his
past
he
has
grown
used
to
a
gypsy
life
he
loves
sleeping
under
their
tents
the
delight
of
perpetual
idleness
and
their
poor
but
sonorous
tongue
the
bear
a
deserter
from
his
native
haunts
is
now
a
shaggy
guest
within
his
tent
in
the
villages
along
the
deserted
route
that
passes
in
front
of
some
moldavian
dwelling
the
bear
dances
clumsily
before
a
timid
crowd
and
growls
and
gnaws
his
tiresome
chain
leaning
on
his
staff
the
old
man
lazily
strikes
the
tambourine
aleko
singing
leads
the
bear
zemphira
makes
the
round
of
the
villagers
collecting
their
voluntary
gifts
when
night
sets
in
all
three
prepare
the
corn
they
have
not
reaped
the
old
man
sleeps
and
all
is
still
the
tent
is
quiet
and
dark
in
the
spring
the
old
man
is
warming
his
numbed
blood
at
a
cradle
his
daughter
sings
of
love
aleko
listens
and
turns

old

cruel
husband
thou
shalt
not

him
he
is
fresher
than
the
spring
warmer
than
the
how
young
and
bold
he
is
how
much
he
loves
me
how
i
caressed
him
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
how
we
laughed
together
at
thy
white
hair
silence
zemphira
enough
then
thou
hast
understood
my
song
zemphira
be
angry
if
thou
wilt
the
song
is
about
thee
retires
husband
old
gypsy
yes
i
remember
that
song
was
made
in
my
time
and
has
long
been
sung
for
folk
amusement
marioula
used
as
we
wandered
over
the
kagula
steppes
to
sing
it
in
the
winter
nights
the
memory
of
past
years
grows
fainter
hourly
but
that
song
impressed
me
deeply
all
is
still
it
is
night
and
the
moon
casts
a
sheen
over
the
blue
of
the
southern
sky
zemphira
has
awakened
the
old
man
oh
father
aleko
is
terrible
listen
to
him
in
his
heavy
sleep
he
groans
and
sobs
old
do
not
disturb
him
keep
quiet
i
have
heard
a
russian
saying
that
at
this
time
at
midnight
the
house
spirit
often
oppresses
a
sleeper
breathing
and
before
dawn
quits
him
again
stay
with
me
father
he
murmurs
zemphira
old
gypsy
he
seeks
thee
even
in
his
sleep
thou
art
dearer
to
him
than
all
the
world
i
care
no
longer
for
his
love
i
am
weary
my
heart
wants
freedom
i
have
already
but
hush
dost
thou
hear
he
repeats
another
name
old
gypsy
whose
name
dost
thou
not
hear
the
hoarse
groan
the
savage
grinding
of
his
teeth
how
terrible
i
will
rouse
him
old
gypsy
no
do
chase
away
the
night
spirit
it
will
leave
him
of
its
own
accord
he
has
turned
and
raised
himself
he
calls
me
he
is
awake
i
will
go
to
him
good
night
and
sleep
where
hast
thou
been
with
my
father
some
spirit
has
oppressed
thee
in
sleep
thy
soul
has
suffered
tortures
thou
didst
frighten
me
grinding
thy
teeth
and
calling
out
to
me
i
dreamt
of
thee
and
saw
as
if
between
us
i
had
horrible
thoughts
put
no
faith
in
treacherous
dreams
alas
i
believe
in
nothing
neither
in
dreams
nor
in
sweet
assurances
nor
in
thy
heart
old
gypsy
young
madman
why
dost
thou
sigh
so
often
we
here
are
free
the
sky
is
clean
the
women
famous
for
their
beauty
weep
not
grief
will
destroy
thee
father
she
loves
me
no
more
old
gypsy
be
comforted
friend
she
is
but
a
child
thy
sadness
is
unreasonable
thou
lovest
anxiously
and
earnestly
but
a
heart
loves
playfully
behold
through
the
distant
vault
the
full
moon
wanders
free
throwing
her
light
equally
over
all
the
world
first
she
peeps
into
one
cloud
lights
it
brilliantly
and
then
glides
to
another
making
to
each
a
rapid
visit
who
shall
point
out
to
her
one
spot
in
the
heavens
and
say
shalt
thou
stay
who
to
the
young
girl
heart
shall
say
only
once
and
change
not
be
pacified
how
she
loved
me
how
tenderly
she
leant
upon
me
in
the
silent
desert
when
we
were
together
in
the
hours
of
night
full
of
gaiety
how
often
with
her
pleasant
prattle
or
intoxicating
caress
has
she
in
an
instant
chased
away
my
gloom
and
now
zemphira
is
false
my
zemphira
is
cold
old
gypsy
listen
and
i
will
tell
thee
a
story
about
myself
long
long
ago
before
the
danube
was
threatened
by
the
muscovite
thou
seest
aleko
i
speak
of
an
ancient
sorrow
at
a
time
when
we
feared
the
sultan
who
through
boodjak
pasha
ruled
the
country
from
the
lofty
towers
of
ackerman
i
was
young
then
and
my
bosom
throbbed
with
the
passion
of
youth
my
curly
locks
were
not
streaked
with
white
among
the
young
beauties
there
was
one
to
whom
i
turned
as
to
the
sun
till
at
last
i
called
her
mine
alas
like
a
falling
star
my
youth
swiftly
sped
still
briefer
was
our
love
marioula
loved
me
but
one
year
one
day
by
the
waters
of
kagula
we
encountered
a
strange
band
of
gypsies
who
pitched
their
tents
near
ours
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
two
nights
we
passed
together
on
the
third
they
left
and
marioula
forsook
her
little
daughter
and
followed
them
i
slept
peacefully
day
broke
and
i
awoke
my
companion
was
not
there
i
searched
i
called
no
trace
remained
zemphira
cried
i
wept
too
from
that
moment
i
became
indifferent
to
all
womankind
never
since
has
my
gaze
sought
amongst
them
a
new
companion
my
dreary
hours
i
have
spent
alone
what
didst
thou
not
instantly
pursue
the
ingrate
and
her
paramour
to
plunge
thy
dagger
in
their
false
hearts
old
gypsy
why
should
i
youth
is
freer
than
the
birds
who
can
restrain
love
everyone
has
his
turn
of
happiness
once
fled
it
will
never
return
no
i
am
different
without
a
struggle
never
would
i
yield
my
rights
at
least
i
would
enjoy
revenge
ah
no
even
if
i
were
to
find
my
enemy
lying
asleep
over
the
abyss
of
the
sea
i
declare
that
even
then
my
foot
should
not
spare
him
but
should
unflinchingly
kick
the
helpless
villain
into
the
depths
of
the
ocean
and
mock
his
sudden
terrible
awakening
with
a
savage
laugh
of
exultation
long
would
his
fall
resound
a
sweet
and
merry
echo
in
my
ears
young
one
kiss
just
one
more
embrace
my
husband
is
jealous
and
angry
i
must
go
young
once
more
a
longer
one
at
parting
here
he
comes
young
gypsy
tell
me
when
shall
we
meet
again
when
the
moon
rises
over
the
hill
beyond
the
tombs
young
gypsy
she
is
deceiving
me
she
will
not
come
run
there
he
is
i
will
be
there
beloved
aleko
sleeps
and
in
his
mind
dim
visions
play
with
a
cry
he
wakes
in
the
dark
and
stretching
out
his
jealous
arm
clutches
with
a
startled
hand
the
cold
bed
his
companion
is
far
away
trembling
he
sits
up
and
listens
all
is
quiet
fear
comes
upon
him
he
shivers
then
grows
hot
rising
from
his
bed
he
leaves
the
tent
and
terribly
pale
wanders
round
the
vans
all
is
silent
the
fields
are
still
and
it
is
dark
the
moon
has
risen
in
a
mist
and
the
twinkling
stars
are
scarcely
seen
but
on
the
dewy
grass
slight
footprints
can
be
discovered
leading
to
the
tombs
with
hurried
tread
he
follows
on
the
path
made
by
the
footmarks
in
the
distance
on
the
road
side
a
tomb
shines
white
before
him
carried
along
by
his
hesitating
feet
full
of
dread
presentiment
his
lips
quivering
his
knees
trembling
he
proceeds
when
suddenly
can
it
be
a
dream
suddenly
he
perceives
two
shadows
close
together
and
hears
two
voices
whispering
over
the
desecrated
grave
first
is
time
second
wait
first
is
time
my
love
second
no
no
we
will
wait
till
morning
first
is
late
already
second
how
timidly
thou
lovest
one
moment
more
first
thou
wilt
destroy
me
second
one
moment
first
if
my
husband
wakes
and
i
am
not
i
am
awake
whither
are
you
going
do
hurry
you
both
are
well
here
by
the
grave
run
run
my
friend
stop
whither
goest
thou
my
beautiful
youth
lie
there
plunges
his
knife
into
aleko
young
gypsy
i
am
dying
aleko
thou
wouldst
kill
him
look
thou
art
covered
with
blood
oh
what
hast
thou
done
nothing
thou
canst
now
enjoy
his
love
enough
i
do
not
fear
thee
thy
threats
i
despise
and
thy
deed
of
murder
i
curse
then
die
thyself
i
die
loving
him
from
the
east
the
light
of
day
is
shining
beyond
the
hill
aleko
besmeared
with
blood
sits
on
the
knife
in
hand
two
corpses
lie
before
him
the
murderer
face
is
terrible
an
excited
crowd
of
timid
gypsies
surrounds
him
a
grave
is
being
dug
a
procession
of
sorrowing
women
approaches
and
each
in
turn
kisses
the
eyes
of
the
dead
the
old
father
sits
apart
staring
at
his
dead
daughter
in
dumb
despair
the
corpses
are
then
raised
and
into
the
cold
bosom
of
the
earth
the
young
couple
are
lowered
from
a
distance
aleko
looks
on
when
they
are
buried
and
the
last
handful
of
earth
thrown
over
them
without
a
word
he
slowly
rolls
from
off
the
stone
on
to
the
grass
then
the
old
man
approaches
him
and
says
leave
us
proud
man
we
area
wild
people
and
have
no
laws
we
neither
torture
nor
execute
we
exact
neither
tears
nor
blood
but
with
a
murderer
we
can
not
live
thou
art
not
born
to
our
wild
life
thou
wouldst
have
freedom
for
thyself
alone
the
sight
of
thee
would
be
intolerable
to
us
we
are
a
timid
gentle
folk
thou
art
fierce
and
bold
depart
then
forgive
us
and
peace
be
with
thee
he
ended
and
with
great
clamour
all
the
wandering
band
arose
and
at
once
quitted
the
camp
and
quickly
vanished
into
the
distant
desert
tract
but
one
van
covered
with
old
rugs
remained
in
the
fatal
plain
standing
alone
so
at
the
coming
of
winter
and
its
morning
mists
a
flock
of
belated
cranes
rise
from
a
field
loudly
shrieking
and
flying
to
the
distant
south
while
one
sad
bird
struck
by
a
fatal
shot
with
wounded
drooping
wing
remains
behind
evening
came
by
the
melancholy
van
no
fire
was
lighted
and
no
one
slept
beneath
its
covering
of
rugs
that
night
the
end
