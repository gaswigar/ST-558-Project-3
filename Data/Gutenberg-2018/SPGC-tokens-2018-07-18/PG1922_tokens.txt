set

on

at

lavarcham
you
will
not
would
you
have
him

he
a
man
would

go
up

a
right
not

i
thinking
and
she
taking

will
talks

old
conchubor
a
night
with
thunder
coming
is
no
night
to

abroad
lavarcham
used
to
every
track
and
pathway
and
the
lightning
itself
would
let
down
its
flame
to
singe
the
beauty
of
her
like
fergus
she
right
chubor
and
let
you
sit
down
and
take
your
ease
takes
a
wallet
from
under
his
and
i
count
out
what
we
brought
and
put
it
in
the
presses
within
goes
into
the
inner
room
with
the
old
conchubor
down
and
ing
where
are
the
mats
and
hangings
and
the
silver
skillets
i
sent
up
for
deirdre
lavarcham

wish
to
be
soiling

she
said
running
out
and
in
with
mud
and
grasses
on
her
feet
and
it
raining
since
the
night
of
samhain
the
silver
skillets
and
the
golden
cups
we
have
beyond

do
it
conchubor
conchubor
up
and
going
to
is
this
hers
lavarcham
to
speak
of
it
is
conchubor
all
say
there
is
her
match
at
fancying
figures
and
throwing
purple
upon
crimson
and
she
edging
them
all
times
with
her
greens
and
gold
conchubor
little
is
she
keeping
wise
and
busy
since
i
passed
before
and
growing
ready
for
her
life
in
emain
lavarcham
that
is
a
tion
will
give
small
pleasure
to
yourself
or
me
up
her
mind
to
speak
if
the
truth
i
tell
you
she
growing
too
wise
to
marry
a
big
king
and
she
a
score
only
let
you
not
be
taking
it
bad
conchubor
but
get
little
good
seeing
her
this
night
for
with
all
my
talking
it
wilfuller
she
growing
these
two
months
or
three
conchubor
but
relieved
things
are
no
is
it
a
poor
thing
you
doing
so
little
to
school
her
to
meet
what
is
to
come
lavarcham
i
after
serving
you
two
score
of
years
and
i
tell
you
this
night
conchubor
she
little
call
to
mind
an
old
woman
when
she
has
the
birds
to
school
her
and
the
pools
in
the
rivers
where
she
goes
bathing
in
the
sun
i
tell
you
if
you
seen
her
that
time
with
her
white
skin
and
her
red
lips
and
the
blue
water
and
the
ferns
about
her
you
know
maybe
and
you
greedy
itself
it
was
for
your
like
she
was
born
at
all
conchubor
it
little
i
heed
for
what
she
was
born
she
be
my
comrade
surely
examines
her
lavarcham
into
sadness
i
in
dread
so
they
were
right
ing
she
bring
destruction
on
the
world
for
it
a
poor
thing
when
you
see
a
settled
man
putting
the
love
he
has
for
a
young
child
and
the
love
he
has
for
a
full
woman
on
a
girl
the
like
of
her
and
it
a
poor
thing
conchubor
to
see
a
high
king
the
way
you
are
this
day
prying
after
her
needles
and
numbering
her
lines
of
thread
conchubor
let
you
not
be
talking
too
far
and
you
old
itself
across
room
and
does
she
know
the
troubles
are
foretold
lavarcham
the
tone
of
the
earlier
i
after
telling
her
one
time
and
another
but
i
do
as
well
speaking
to
a
lamb
of
ten
weeks
and
it
racing
the
hills
not
the
dread
of
death
or
troubles
that
would
tame
her
like
conchubor
looks
coming
now
and
let
you
walk
in
and
keep
fergus
till
i
speak
with
her
a
while
lavarcham
if
after
vexing
you
itself
it
be
best
you
taking
her
hasty
or
scolding
her
at
all
conchubor
i
no
call
to
i
well
pleased
she
light
and
airy
lavarcham
at
his
well
pleased
is
it
a
snort
of
it
a
queer
thing
the
way
the
likes
of
me
do
be
telling
the
truth
and
the
wise
are
lying
all
times
goes
into
room
on
left
conchubor
arranges
himself
before
a
mirror
for
a
moment
then
goes
a
little
to
the
left
and
waits
deirdre
comes
in
poorly
dressed
with
a
little
bag
and
a
bundle
of
twigs
in
her
arms
she
is
astonished
for
a
moment
when
she
sees
then
she
makes
a
courtesy
to
him
and
goes
to
the
hearth
without
any
conchubor
the
gods
save
you
deirdre
i
have
come
up
bringing
you
rings
and
jewels
from
emain
macha
deirdre
the
gods
save
you
conchubor
what
have
you
brought
from
the
hills
deirdre
a
bag
of
nuts
and
twigs
for
our
fires
at
the
dawn
of
day
conchubor
annoyance
in
spite
of
and
it
that
way
picking
up
the
manners
will
fit
you
to
be
queen
of
ulster
deirdre
a
little
defiant
by
his
i
have
no
wish
to
be
a
queen
conchubor
you
wish
to
be
dressing
in
your
duns
and
grey
and
you
herding
your
geese
or
driving
your
calves
to
their
shed
like
the
common
lot
scattered
in
the
glens
deirdre
i
would
not
conchubor
goes
to
tapestry
and
begins
to
a
girl
born
the
way
i
born
is
more
likely
to
wish
for
a
mate
who
be
her
likeness
a
man
with
his
hair
like
the
raven
maybe
and
his
skin
like
the
snow
and
his
lips
like
blood
spilt
on
it
conchubor
his
mistake
and
after
a
moment
takes
a
flattering
tone
looking
at
her
whatever
you
wish
there
no
queen
but
would
be
well
pleased
to
have
your
skill
at
choosing
colours
and
making
pictures
on
the
cloth
what
is
it
you
figuring
deirdre
three
young
men
and
they
chasing
in
the
green
gap
of
a
wood
conchubor
almost
it
soon
you
have
dogs
with
silver
chains
to
be
chasing
in
the
woods
of
emain
for
i
have
white
hounds
rearing
up
for
you
and
grey
horses
that
i
chosen
from
the
finest
in
ulster
and
britain
and
gaul
deirdre
as
heard
tell
in
ulster
and
britain
and
gaul
naisi
and
his
brothers
have
no
match
and
they
chasing
in
the
woods
conchubor
is
it
a
strange
thing
you
be
talking
of
naisi
and
his
brothers
or
figuring
them
either
when
you
know
the
things
that
are
foretold
about
selves
and
you
yet
you
little
knowledge
and
i
do
wrong
taking
it
bad
when
it
be
my
share
from
this
out
to
keep
you
the
way
you
have
little
call
to
trouble
for
knowledge
or
its
want
either
deirdre
yourself
should
be
wise
surely
conchubor
the
like
of
me
has
a
store
of
knowledge
that
a
weight
and
terror
it
for
that
we
do
choose
out
the
like
of
self
that
are
young
and
glad
only
thinking
you
are
gay
and
lively
each
day
in
the
year
deirdre
i
do
know
if
that
true
conchubor
there
are
lonesome
days
and
bad
nights
in
this
place
like
another
conchubor
you
should
have
as
few
sad
days
i
thinking
as
i
have
glad
and
good
ones
deirdre
what
is
it
has
you
that
way
ever
coming
this
place
when
you
hear
the
old
woman
saying
a
good
child
as
happy
as
a
king
conchubor
how
would
i
be
happy
seeing
age
coming
on
me
each
year
when
the
dry
leaves
are
blowing
back
and
forward
at
the
gate
of
emain
and
yet
this
last
while
i
saying
out
when
i
see
the
furze
breaking
and
the
daws
sitting
two
and
two
on
by
the
duns
of
emain
deirdre
a
year
nearer
her
full
age
when
she
be
my
mate
and
rade
and
then
i
glad
surely
deirdre
to
i
will
not
be
your
mate
in
emain
conchubor
heeding
there
you
be
proud
and
happy
and
learn
that
if
young
men
are
great
hunters
yet
it
with
the
like
of
myself
you
find
a
edge
of
what
is
priceless
in
your
own
like
what
we
all
need
is
a
place
is
safe
and
splendid
and
it
that
you
get
in
emain
in
two
days
or

gold
on

to
be
shut
up
in

pale
and
lonesome
and
she
wasting
away
comes
to
him

her
hands
on

small
thing

foretold
about
the
ruin
of

of
the
grave

in
muffled
in
a
lavarcham
deirdre
deirdre
deirdre
from
my
welcome
lavarcham
whose
curagh
is
rowing
from
ulster
i
saw
the
oars
through
the
tops
of
the
trees
and
i
thought
it
was
you
were
coming
towards
us
lavarcham
i
came
in
the
shower
was
before
dawn
deirdre
and
who
is
coming
lavarcham
let
you
not
be
startled
or
taking
it
bad
deirdre
fergus
bringing
messages
of
peace
from
conchubor
to
take
naisi
and
his
brothers
back
to
emain
deirdre
naisi
and
his

are
well
pleased
with
this
place
and
what
would
take
them
back
to
conchubor
in
ulster
lavarcham
their
like
would
go
any
place
where
they
see
death
standing
more
i
in
dread
conchubor
wants
to
have
yourself
and
to
kill
naisi
and
that
that
be
the
ruin
of
the
sons
of
usna
i
silly
maybe
to
be
dreading
the
like
but
those
have
a
great
love
for
yourself
have
a
right
to
be
in
dread
always
deirdre
emain
should
be
no
safe
place
for
myself
and
naisi
and
is
it
a
hard
thing
they
leave
us
no
peace
lavarcham
and
we
so
quiet
in
the
woods
lavarcham
it
a
hard
thing
surely
but
let
you
take
my
word
and
swear
naisi
by
the
earth
and
the
sun
over
it
and
the
four
quarters
of
the
moon
not
go
back
to
emain
for
good
faith
or
bad
faith
the
time
conchubor
keeping
the
high
throne
of
ireland
it
that
would
save
you
surely
deirdre
there
tle
power
in
oaths
to
stop
what
coming
and
little
power
in
what
i
do
lavarcham
to
change
the
story
of
conchubor
and
naisi
and
the
things
old
men
foretold
lavarcham
was
there
little
power
in
what
you
did
the
night
you
dressed
in
your
finery
and
ran
naisi
off
along
with
you
in
spite
of
conchubor
and
the
big
nobles
did
dread
the
blackness
of
your
luck
it
was
power
enough
you
had
that
night
to
bring
distress
and
anguish
and
now
i
pointing
you
a
way
to
save
naisi
not
stir
stick
or
straw
to
aid
me
deirdre
little
let
you
not
raise
your
voice
against
me
lavarcham
if
you
have
will
itself
to
guard
naisi
lavarcham
out
in
naisi
is
it
i
did
care
if
the
crows
were
stripping
his
at
the
dawn
of
day
it
to
stop
your
own
despair
and
wailing
and
you
waking
up
in
a
cold
bed
without
the
man
you
have
your
heart
on
i
am
raging
now
up
with
yet
there
is
more
men
than
naisi
in
it
and
maybe
i
was
a
big
fool
thinking
his
dangers
and
this
day
would
fill
you
up
with
dread
deirdre
let
you
end
such
talking
is
a
fool
only
when
it
well
you
know
if
a
thing
harmed
naisi
it
is
i
would
live
after
him
it
well
you
know
it
this
day
i
dreading
seven
years
and
i
fine
nights
watching
the
heifers
walking
to
the
haggard
with
long
shadows
on
the
grass
or
the
time
i
been
stretched
in
the
sunshine
when
i
heard
ainnle
and
ardan
stepping
lightly
and
they
saying
was
there
ever
the
like
of
deirdre
for
a
happy
and
sleepy
queen
lavarcham
fully
and
yet
you
go
and
welcome
is
it
if
naisi
chooses
deirdre
i
dread
going
or
staying
lavarcham
it
lonesome
this
place
having
happiness
like
ours
till
i
asking
each
day
will
this
day
match
yesterday
and
will
morrow
take
a
good
place
beside
the
same
day
in
the
year
that
gone
and
wondering
all
times
is
it
a
game
worth
playing
living
on
until
you
dried
and
old
and
our
joy
is
gone
for
ever
lavarcham
if
it
that
ails
you
i
tell
you
there
little
hurt
getting
old
though
young
girls
and
poets
do
be
storming
at
the
shapes
of
age
there
little
hurt
getting
old
saving
when
you
looking
back
the
way
i
looking
this
day
and
seeing
the
young
you
have
a
love
for
breaking
up
their
hearts
with
folly
to
take
my
word
and
stop
naisi
and
the
come
you
have
more
joy
having
the
senses
of
an
old
woman
and
you
with
your
little
grandsons
shrieking
round
you
than
i
have
this
night
putting
on
the
red
mouth
and
the
white
arms
you
have
to
go
walking
lonesome
byways
with
a
gamey
king
deirdre
it
little
joy
of
a
young
woman
or
an
old
woman
i
have
from
this
day
surely
but
what
use
is
in
our
talking
when
there
naisi
on
the
foreshore
and
fergus
with
him
lavarcham
i
late
so
with
my
warnings
for
fergus
talk
the
moon
over
to
take
a
new
path
in
the
sky
you
not
stop
him
this
day
and
is
it
a
strange
story
you
were
a
plague
and
torment
since
you
were
that
height
to
those
did
hang
their
lifetimes
on
your
voice
with
trouble
ing
her
cloak
about
do
think
bad
of
my
crying
i
not
the
like
of
many
and
see
a
score
of
naked
corpses
and
not
heed
them
at
all
but
i
destroyed
seeing
yourself
in
your
hour
of
joy
when
the
end
is
coming
surely
comes
in
quickly
rather
ragged
bows
to
owen
fergus
men
are
calling
you
you
were
seen
on
the
path
and
he
and
naisi
want
you
for
their
talk
below
lavarcham
at
him
with
yourself
an
thing
to
meet
a
morning
is
the
like
of
this
yet
if
you
are
a
spy
itself
i
go
and
give
my
word
wanting
surely
owen
so
i
found
you
alone
and
i
after
waiting
three
weeks
getting
ague
and
asthma
in
the
chill
of
the
bogs
till
i
saw
naisi
caught
with
fergus
deirdre
i
heard
news
of
fergus
what
brought
you
from
ulster
owen
has
been
searching
finds
a
loaf
and
sits
down
eating
greedily
and
ting
it
with
a
large
the
full
moon
i
thinking
and
it
squeezing
the
crack
in
my
skull
was
there
ever
a
man
crossed
nine
waves
after
a
fool
wife
and
he
not
away
in
his
head
deirdre
it
should
be
a
long
time
since
you
left
emain
where
civility
in
speech
with
queens
owen
it
a
long
while
surely
three
weeks
i
am
losing
my
manners
beside
the
saxon
at
the
head
of
the
bog
three
weeks
is
a
long
space
and
yet
seven
years
spancelled
with
naisi
and
the
pair
deirdre
to
fold
up
her
silks
and
three
weeks
of
your
days
might
be
long
surely
yet
seven
years
are
a
short
space
for
the
like
of
naisi
and
myself
owen
if
they
a
short
space
there
are
many
the
like
of
you
was
there
a
queen
in
tara
had
to
walk
out
every
morning
till
she
meet
a
stranger
and
see
the
flame
of
courtship
leaping
up
within
his
eye
tell
me
now
towards
are
you
well
pleased
that
length
with
the
same
man
snorting
next
you
at
the
dawn
of
day
deirdre
am
i
well
pleased
seven
years
seeing
the
same
sun
ing
light
across
the
branches
at
the
dawn
of
day
it
a
heartbreak
to
the
wise
that
it
for
a
short
space
we
have
the
same
things
only
yet
the
earth
itself
is
a
silly
place
maybe
when
a
man
a
fool
and
talker
owen
well
go
take
your
choice
stay
here
and
rot
with
naisi
or
go
to
conchubor
in
emain
conchubor
a
wrinkled
fool
with
a
swelling
belly
on
him
and
eyes
falling
downward
from
his
shining
crown
naisi
should
be
stale
and
weary
yet
there
are
many
roads
deirdre
and
i
tell
you
liefer
be
bleaching
in
a
than
living
on
without
a
touch
of
kindness
from
your
eyes
and

thing
to

be
your
friends
in
emain

great
sport
one
day
seeing
naisi
getting
a
harshness
in
his
two
sheep

and
he
looking
on

you
credit

my
father
used
to
be
in
the
broom
and
heather

lavarcham
with
a
little
bird
chirping
out
above
their
heads
and
now
she

a
raven
from
a
carcase
on
a
hill

sad
cry
that
brings
dignity
into

their
white
and
long
arms
going
from
them
and
their
backs

little
naisi
and

are
coming
on
the
path

jealous
of
the
midges
and
the
dust
is
in
the
air
himself
in
his
cloak
with
a
sort
of
warning
in
his
i
give
you
a
riddle
deirdre
why
is
my
father
as
ugly
and
old
as
conchubor
you
no
answer

because
naisi
killed
him
curious

of
that
and

moment

of

be
hot
and
thirsty
after
mounting
the
rocks
fergus
it
a
sunny
nook
you

in
alban
yet
any
man
would
be
well
pleased
mounting
higher
rocks
to
fetch
yourself
and
naisi
back
to
emain
deirdre
answered
they
would
go
fergus
they
have
not
but
when
i
was
a
young
man
we
have
given
a
lifetime
to
be
in
ireland
a
score
of
weeks
and
to
this
day
the
old
men
have
nothing
so
heavy
as
knowing
it
in
a
short
while
lose
the
high
skies
are
over
ireland
and
the
lonesome
mornings
with
birds
crying
on
the
bogs
let
you
come
this
day
for
there
no
place
but
ireland
where
the
gael
can
have
peace
always
naisi
it
true
surely
yet
we
better
this
place
while
conchubor
in
emain
macha
fergus
him
there
are
your
sureties
and
conchubor
seal
i
am
your
surety
with
chubor
you
not
be
young
always
and
time
you
were
making
yourselves
ready
for
the
years
will
come
building
up
a
homely
dun
beside
the
seas
of
ireland
and
getting
in
your
children
from
the
princes
wives
it
little
joy
wandering
till
age
is
on
you
and
your
youth
is
gone
away
so
you
best
come
this
night
for
you
have
great
pleasure
putting
out
your
foot
and
saying
i
am
in
ireland
surely
deirdre
it
is
pleasure
i
have
while
conchubor
is
king
in
emain
fergus
would
you
doubt
the
seals
of
conall
cearneach
and
the
kings
of
meath
gets
parchments
from
his
cloak
and
gives
them
to
naisi
more
it
easy
being
fearful
and
you
alone
in
the
woods
yet
it
would
be
a
poor
thing
if
a
timid
woman
her
a
could
turn
away
the
sons
of
usna
from
the
life
of
kings
let
you
be
thinking
on
the
years
to
come
deirdre
and
the
way
you
have
a
right
to
see
naisi
a
high
and
justice
beside
some
king
of
emain
would
it
be
a
poor
story
if
a
queen
the
like
of
you
should
have
no
thought
but
to
be
scraping
up
her
hours
dallying
in
the
sunshine
with
the
sons
of
kings
deirdre
away
a
little
i
leave
the
choice
to
naisi
back
towards
yet
you
do
well
fergus
to
go
on
your
own
way
for
the
sake
of
your
own
years
so
you
not
be
saying
till
your
hour
of
death
maybe
it
was
yourself
brought
naisi
and
his
brothers
to
a
grave
was
scooped
by
treachery
into
fergus
it
is
a
poor
thing
to
see
a
queen
so
lonesome
and
afraid
watches
till
he
is
sure
deirdre
can
not
hear
listen
now
to
what
i
saying
you
do
well
to
come
back
to
men
and
women
are
your
match
and
comrades
and
not
be
lingering
until
the
day
that
you
grow
weary
and
hurt
deirdre
showing
her
the
hardness
will
grow
up
within
your
eyes
you
here
years
and
plenty
to
know
it
truth
i
saying
comes
out
of
tent
with
a
horn
of
wine
she
catches
the
beginning
of
naisi
speech
and
stops
with
stony
naisi
i
not
tell
you
a
lie
there
have
been
days
a
while
past
when
i

throwing
a
line
for

or
watching
for
the
run
of
hares
that
i
a
dread
upon
me
a
day

i
weary
of
her
voice
and
deirdre

and
take
my
word

your
dread
and
she

no
peace
from
this
out
in
the
woods
naisi
she
not

thought
of
getting
old
or
wearied
it
that
puts
wonder
in
her
days
and
she
with
spirits
would
keep
bravery
and
laughter
in
a
town
with
plague
drops
the
horn
of
wine
and
crouches
down
where
she
fergus
that
humour
leave
her
but
we
no
call
going
too
far
with
one
word
borrowing
another
will
you
come
this
night
to
emain
macha
naisi
i
not
go
fergus
i
had
dreams
of
getting
old
and
weary
and
losing
my
delight
in
deirdre
but
my
dreams
were
dreams
only
what
are
conchubor
seals
and
all
your
talk
of
emain
and
the
fools
of
meath
beside
one
evening
in
glen
masain
we
stay
this
place
till

autumn
and
the
springtime
even
when
a
bird
in
every
bush
making
his
own
stir
till
the
fall
of
night
but
this
talk
brought
me
ease
and
i
see
we
as
happy
as
the
leaves
on
the
young
trees
and
we
be
so
ever
and
always
though
we
live
the
age
of
the
eagle
and
the
salmon
and
the
crow
of
britain

arm
round
leave
troubling
and
we
go
this
night
to
glen
da
ruadh
where
the
salmon
will
be
running
with
the
tide
and
sits
deirdre
a
very
low
with
the
tide
in
a
little
while
we
will
be
journeying
again
or
it
is
our
own
blood
maybe
will
be
running
away
turns
and
clings
to
the
dawn
and
evening
are
a
little
while
the
winter
and
the
summer
pass
quickly
and
what
way
would
you
and
i
naisi
have
joy
for
ever
naisi
we
have
the
joy
is
highest
till
our
age
is
come
for
it
is
fergus
talk
of
great
deeds
could
take
us
back
to
emain
deirdre
it
is
to
great
deeds
going
but
to
near
troubles
and
the
shortening
of
your
days
the
time
that
they
are
bright
and
sunny
and
is
it
a
poor
thing
that
i
deirdre
could
not
hold
you
away
naisi
i
said
we
stay
in
alban
always
deirdre
there
no
place
to
stay
ways
it
a
long
time
we
had
pressing
the
lips
together
going
up
and
down
resting
in
our
arms
naisi
waking
with
the
smell
of
june
in
the
tops
of
the
grasses
and
listening
to
the
birds
in
the
branches
that
are
highest
it
a
long
time
we
had
but
the
end
has
come
surely
naisi
would
you
have
us
go
to
emain
though
if
any
ask
the
reason
we
do
not
know
it
and
we
journeying
as
the
thrushes
come
from
the
north
or
young
birds
fly
out
on
a
dark
sea
deirdre
there
reason
all
times
for
an
end
that
come
and
i
well
pleased
naisi
we
going
forward
in
the
winter
the
time
the
sun
has
a
low
place
and
the
moon
has
her
mastery
in
a
dark
sky
for
it
you
and
i
are
well
lodged
our
last
day
where
there
is
a
light
behind
the
clear
trees
and
the
berries
on
the
thorns
are
a
red
wall
naisi
if
our
time
in
this
place
is
ended
come
away
without
ainnle
and
ardan
to
the
woods
of
the
east
for
it
right
to
be
away
from
all
people
when
two
lovers
have
their
love
only
come
away
and
we
be
safe
always
deirdre
there
no
safe
place
naisi
on
the
ridge
of
the
world
and
it
in
the
quiet
woods
i
seen
them
digging
our
grave
throwing
out
the
clay
on
leaves
are
bright
and
withered
naisi
more
come
away
deirdre
and
it
little
we
think
of
safety
or
the
grave
beyond
it
and
we
resting
in
a
little
corner
between
the
daytime
and
the
long
night
deirdre
and
this
hour
we
between
the
daytime
and
a
night
where
there
is
sleep
for
ever
and
it
a
better
thing
to
be
following
on
to
a
near
death
than
to
be
bending
the
head
down
and
dragging
with
the
feet
and
seeing
one
day
a
blight
showing
upon
love
where
it
is
sweet
and
tender
naisi
voice
broken
with
if
a
near
death
is
coming
what
will
be
my
trouble
losing
the
earth
and
the
stars
over
it
and
you
deirdre
are
their
flame
and
bright
crown
come
away
into
the
safety
of
the
woods
deirdre
her
head
there
are
as
many
ways
to
wither
love
as
there
are
stars
in
a
night
of
samhain
but
there
is
no
way
to
keep
life
or
love
with
it
a
short
space
only
it
for
that
there
nothing
lonesome
like
a
love
is
watching
out
the
time
most
lovers
do
be
sleeping
it
for
that
we
setting
out
for
emain
macha
when
the
tide
turns
on
the
sand
naisi
you
right
maybe
it
should
be
a
poor
thing
to
see
great
lovers
and
they
sleepy
and
old
deirdre
a
more
tender
we
seven
years
without
roughness
or
growing
weary
seven
years
so
sweet
and
shining
the
gods
would
be
hard
set
to
give
us
seven
days
the
like
of
them
it
for
that
we
going
to
emain
where
there
be
a
rest
for
ever
or
a
place
for
forgetting
in
great
crowds
and
they
making
a
stir
naisi
we
go
surely
in
place
of
keeping
a
watch
on
a
love
had
no
match
and
it
wasting
away
cling
to
each
other
for
a
moment

cold
of

fergus
stopped
in

me
thinking
you
have
it
in
mind
to
bring
trouble
this
night
on
emain
and
ireland
and
the
big
world
east
beyond
them
goes
to
and
yet
you
do
well
to
be
going
to
your
dun
and
not
putting
shame
on
her
meeting
the
high
king
and
she
seamed
and
sweaty
and
in
great
disorder
from
the
dust
of
many
roads
ah
bor
my
lad
beauty
goes
quickly
in
the
woods
and
you
let
a
great
gasp
i
tell
you
if
you
set
your
eyes
this
night
on
deirdre
conchubor
it
little
i
care
if
she
white
and
worn
for
it
i
did
rear
her
from
a
child
i
should
have
a
good
right
to
meet
and
see
her
always
lavarcham
a
good
right
is
it
have
the
blind
a
good
right
to
be
seeing
and
the
lame
to
be
dancing
and
the
dummies
singing
tunes
it
that
right
you
have
to
be
looking
for
gaiety
on
deirdre
lips
come
on
to
your
dun
i
saying
and
leave
her
quiet
for
one
night
itself
conchubor
sudden
i
not
go
when
it
long
enough
i
am
above
in
my
dun
stretching
east
and
west
without
a
comrade
and
i
more
needy
maybe
than
the
thieves
of
meath
you
think
i
old
and
wise
but
i
tell
you
the
wise
know
the
old
must
die
and
they
leave
no
chance
for
a
thing
slipping
from
them
they
set
their
blood
to
win
lavarcham
her
if
you
old
and
wise
it
i
the
same
bor
and
i
telling
you
you
not
have
her
though
you
ready
to
destroy
mankind
and
skin
the
gods
to
win
her
there
things
a
king
ca
have
conchubor
and
if
you
go
rampaging
this
night
you
be
apt
to
win
nothing
but
death
for
many
and
a
sloppy
face
of
trouble
on
your
own
self
before
the
day
will
come

buried
before

of
us
two
he
jealous

high
ferns
together
pulls
him
i
hear
strange
words
in
the
trees
naisi
it

the
strange
fighters
of

i
saw
them
passing
as
we
came
deirdre
him
towards
the
come
to
this
side
listen
naisi
naisi
there
are
more
of
them
we
are
shut
in
and
i
have
not
ainnle
and
ardan
to
stand
near
me
is
it
a
hard
thing
that
we
three
who
have
conquered
many
may
not
die
together
deirdre
and
it
a
hard
thing
that
you
and
i
are
in
this
place
by
our
opened
grave
though
none
have
lived
had
happiness
like
ours
those
days
in
alban
that
went
by
so
quick
naisi
it
a
hard
thing
surely
lost
those
days
for
ever
and
yet
it
a
good
thing
maybe
that
all
goes
quick
for
when
i
in
that
grave
it
soon
a
day
come
be
too
wearied
to
be
crying
out
and
that
bring
you
ease
deirdre
i
not
be
here
to
know
if
that
is
true
naisi
it
our
three
selves
he
kill
night
and
then
in
two
months
or
three
see
him
walking
down
for
courtship
with
yourself
deirdre
i
not
be
here
naisi
you
best
keep
him
off
maybe
and
then
when
the
time
comes
make
your
way
to
some
place
west
in
donegal
and
it
there
you
get
used
to
stretching
out
lonesome
at
the
fall
of
night
and
waking
some
for
the
day
deirdre
let
you
not
be
saying
things
are
worse
than
death
naisi
little
i
one
word
left
if
a
day
comes
in
the
west
that
the
larks
are
cocking
their
crests
on
the
edge
of
the
clouds
and
the
cuckoos
making
a
stir
and
there
a
man
you
fancy
let
you
not
be
thinking
that
day
i
be
well
pleased
you
go
on
keening
always
deirdre
to
look
at
and
if
it
was
i
that
died
naisi
would
you
take
another
woman
to
fill
up
my
place
naisi
it
little
i
know
saving
only
that
it
a
hard
and
bitter
thing
leaving
the
earth
and
a
worse
and
harder
thing
leaving
yourself
alone
and
late
to
be
making
lamentation
on
its
face
always
deirdre
i
die
when
you
do
naisi
i
not
have
come
here
from
alban
but
i
knew
i
be
along
with
you
in
emain
and
you
living
or
dead
yet
this
night
strange
and
distant
talk
you
making
only
naisi
there
nothing
surely
the
like
of
a
new
grave
of
open
earth
for
putting
a
great
space
between
two
friends
that
love
deirdre
if
there
is
it
that
grave
when
it
closed
will
make
us
one
for
ever
and
we
two
lovers
have
had
great
space
without
weariness
or
growing
old
or
any
sadness
of
the
mind
conchubor
in
on
i
bid
you
welcome
naisi
naisi
you
welcome
conchubor
i
well
pleased
you
come
conchubor

you
not
think
bad
of
this
place
where
i
put
you
till
other
rooms
are
readied
naisi
we
know
the
room
you
readied
we
know
what
stirred
you
to
send
your
seals
and
fergus
into
alban
and
stop
him
in
the
north
curtain
and
pointing
to
the
and
dig
that
grave
before
us
now
i
ask
what
brought
you
here
conchubor
i
come
to
look
on
deirdre
naisi
look
on
her
you
a
knacky
fancier
and
it
well
you
chose
the
one
lure
from
alban
look
on
her
i
tell
you
and
when
you
looked
i
got
ten
fingers
will
squeeze
your
mottled
goose
neck
though
you
king

deirdre
between
hush
naisi
maybe
conchubor
make
peace
do
not
mind
him
conchubor

has
cause
to
rage
conchubor
it
little
i
heed
his
ing
when
a
call
would
bring
my
fighters
from
the
trees
but
what
do
you
say
deirdre
deirdre
i
say
so
near
that
grave
we
seem
three
lonesome
people
and
by
a
new
made
grave
there
no
man
will
keep
brooding
on
a
woman
lips
or
on
the
man
he
hates
it
not
long
till
your
own
grave
will
be
dug
in
emain
and
you
go
down
to
it
more
easy
if
you
let
call
ainnle
and
ardan
the
way
we
have
a
supper
all
together
and
fill
that
grave
and
you

well
pleased

this
out

four
new
friends

death
with
a
hard
word
from
your
lips
in
my
ear

had
a
dream

this
night
has
waked
us
surely
in
a
little
while
we
lived
too
long

poor
thing

safety
of

edge

naisi
naisi
we
are
attacked
and
ruined
deirdre

go
where
they
are
calling

an
instant

you
no
shame
loitering
and
talking
and
a
cruel
death
facing
ainnle
and
ardan
in
the
woods
naisi
they
not
get
a
death
that
cruel
and
they
with
men
alone
women
that
have
loved
are
cruel
only
and
if
i
went
on
living
from
this
day
i
be
putting
a
curse
on
the
lot
of
them
i
meet
walking
in
the
east
or
west
putting
a
curse
on
the
sun
that
gave
them
beauty
and
on
the
madder
and
the
put
red
upon
their
cloaks
deirdre
i
well

make
a
story
that

from
this
out

emain
keen
of
men
voices
is
heard
deirdre
and
it
is
not
i
will
be
a
queen

your
lamentation

this
night
when

i
could
set
my
teeth
into
the
heart
of
a
king

my
pity
for
my
own
self
destroyed

and
time
out
into
a
but
who
pity
deirdre
has
lost
the
lips
of
naisi
from
her
neck
and
from
her
cheek
for
ever
pity

lost
the
twilight
in
the
woods
with
naisi
when

silver
and
copper
and

fine
gold
conchubor
it
know
the
way
to
pity
and
care
you
and
i
with
a
share
of
troubles

would
be
a
good
bargain
if
it
was
i
was
in
the
grave
and
deirdre
crying
over
me
and
it
was
naisi
who
was
old
and
desolate

it
is
i
who
am
desolate
i
deirdre
that
will
not
live
till
i
am
old
conchubor
it
not
long
you
be
desolate
and
i
seven
years
saying
it
a
bright
day
for
deirdre
in
the
woods
of
alban
or
saying
again
what
way
will
deirdre
be
sleeping
this
night
and
wet
leaves
and
branches
driving
from
the
north
let
you
not
break
the
thing
i
set
my
life
on
and
you
giving
yourself
up
to
your
sorrow
when
it
joy
and
sorrow
do
burn
out
like
straw
blazing
in
an
east
wind
deirdre
on
was
it
that
way
with
your
sorrow
when
i
and
naisi
went
northward
from
slieve
fuadh
and
let
raise
our
sails
for
alban
conchubor
there
one
sorrow
has
no
end
surely
that
being
old
and
some
extraordinary
but
you
and
i
will
have
a
little
peace
in
emain
with
harps
playing
and
old
men
telling
stories
at
the
fall
of
night
i
let
build
rooms
for
our
two
selves
deirdre
with
red
gold
upon
the
walls
and
ceilings
that
are
set
with
bronze
there
was
never
a
queen

the
east

a
house
the
like
of
your
house
that
ing
for
yourself
in
emain

in
flames

come
back
and
is
setting
fire
to
the
world

a
moment

into
grave

crouches
down
and
begins
swaying
herself
backwards
and
forwards
keening
ly
at
first

words

not
heard
then
they
become
deirdre

age
or
death
coming
you
that
were
my
pany
when
the
fires
on
the
were
put
out
and
the
stars
were
our
friends
only
turn
my
thoughts
back
from
this
night
pitiful
for
want
of
pity
to
the
time
it
was
your
rods
and
cloaks
made
a
little
tent
for
me
where
there
be
a
birch
tree
making
shelter
and
a
dry
stone
though
from
this
day
my
own
fingers
will
be
making
a
tent
for
me
spreading
out
my
hairs
and
they
knotted
with
the
rain
and
old
woman
come
in
stealthily
on
deirdre
seeing
it
is
i
deirdre
will
be
crouching
in
a
dark
place
i
deirdre
that
was
young
with
naisi
and
brought
sorrow
to
his
grave
in
emain
old
woman
is
that
deirdre
broken
down
that
was
so
light
and
airy
lavarcham
it
is
surely
crying
out
over
their
grave
goes
to
deirdre
it
will
be
my
share
from
this
out
to
be
making
lamentation
on
his
stone
always
and
i
crying
for
a
love
will
be
the
like
of
a
star
shining
on
a
little
harbour
by
the
sea
lavarcham
let
you
rise
up
deirdre
and
come
off
while
there
are
none
to
heed
us
the
way
i
find
you
shelter
and
some
friend
to
guard
you
deirdre
to
what
place
would
i
go
away
from
naisi
what
are
the
woods
out
naisi
or
the
sea
shore
lavarcham
if
it
is
that
way
you
be
come
till
i
find
you
a
sunny
place
where
you
be
a
great
wonder
they
call
the
queen
of
sorrows
and
begin
taking
a
pride
to
be
sitting
up
pausing
and
dreaming
when
the
summer
comes
deirdre
it
was
the
voice
of
naisi
that
was
strong
in
summer
the
voice
of
naisi
that
was
sweeter
than
pipes
playing
but
from
this
day
will
be
dumb
always
lavarcham
old
she
does
heed
us
at
all
we
be
hard
set
to
rouse
her
old
woman
if
we
do
the
high
king
will
rouse
her
coming
down

not
a
low
thing
to
be
chosen
by
conchubor

was
wise
and
naisi
had
no
match
for
bravery
it
is
not
a
small
thing
to
be
rid
of
grey
hairs
and
the
loosening
of
the
teeth
a
sort
of
it
was
the
choice
of
lives
