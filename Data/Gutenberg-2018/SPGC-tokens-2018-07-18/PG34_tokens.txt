this

the
composition
of
this
booklet
was
originally
started
because
the
computer
science
department
at
widener
university
was
in
desperate
need
of
documentation
describing
the
capabilities
of
this
great
new
internet
link
we
obtained
it
since
grown
into
an
effort
to
acquaint
the
reader
with
much
of
what
currently
available
over
the
internet
aimed
at
the
novice
user
it
attempts
to
remain
operating
system
neutral
information
herein
is
specific
to
unix
vms
or
any
other
environment
this
booklet
will
hopefully
be
usable
by
nearly
anyone
a
user
session
is
usually
offset
from
the
rest
of
the
paragraph
as
such
prompt
command
the
results
are
usually
displayed
here
the
purpose
of
this
booklet
is
first
it
intended
to
serve
as
a
reference
piece
which
someone
can
easily
grab
on
the
fly
and
look
something
up
also
it
forms
a
foundation
from
which
people
can
explore
the
vast
expanse
of
the
internet
zen
and
the
art
of
the
internet
does
spend
a
significant
amount
of
time
on
any
one
point
rather
it
provides
enough
for
people
to
learn
the
specifics
of
what
his
or
her
local
system
offers
one
warning
is
perhaps
in
order
territory
we
are
entering
can
become
a
fantastic
hours
can
slip
by
people
can
come
and
go
and
you
be
locked
into
cyberspace
remember
to
do
your
work
with
that
i
welcome
you
the
new
user
to
the
net
brendan

acknowledgements
certain
sections
in
this
booklet
are
not
my
original
work
they
are
derived
from
documents
that
were
available
on
the
internet
and
already
aptly
stated
their
areas
of
concentration
the
chapter
on
usenet
is
in
large
part
made
up
of
what
posted
monthly
to
with
some
editing
and
rewriting
also
the
main
section
on
archie
was
derived
from
by
peter
deutsch
of
the
mcgill
university
computing
centre
it
available
via
anonymous
ftp
from
much
of
what
in
the
telnet
section
came
from
an
impressive
introductory
document
put
together
by
suranet
some
definitions
in
the
one
are
from
an
excellent
glossary
put
together
by
colorado
state
university
this
guide
would
not
be
the
same
without
the
aid
of
many
people
on
the
net
and
the
providers
of
resources
that
are
already
out
there
like
to
thank
the
folks
who
gave
this
a
and
returned
some
excellent
comments
suggestions
and
criticisms
and
those
who
provided
information
on
the
fly
glee
willis
deserves
particular
mention
for
all
of
his
work
this
guide
would
have
been
considerably
less
polished
without
his
help

basics
we
are
truly
in
an
information
society
now
more
than
ever
moving
vast
amounts
of
information
quickly
across
great
distances
is
one
of
our
most
pressing
needs
from
small
entrepreneurial
efforts
to
the
largest
of
corporations
more
and
more
professional
people
are
discovering
that
the
only
way
to
be
successful
in
the
and
beyond
is
to
realize
that
technology
is
advancing
at
a
pace
they
must
somehow
keep
up
likewise
researchers
from
all
corners
of
the
earth
are
finding
that
their
work
thrives
in
a
networked
environment
immediate
access
to
the
work
of
colleagues
and
a
virtual
library
of
millions
of
volumes
and
thousands
of
papers
affords
them
the
ability
to
encorporate
a
body
of
knowledge
heretofore
unthinkable
work
groups
can
now
conduct
interactive
conferences
with
each
other
paying
no
heed
to
physical
location
possibilities
are
endless
you
have
at
your
fingertips
the
ability
to
talk
in
with
someone
in
japan
send
a
short
story
to
a
group
of
people
who
will
critique
it
for
the
sheer
pleasure
of
doing
so
see
if
a
macintosh
sitting
in
a
lab
in
canada
is
turned
on
and
find
out
if
someone
happens
to
be
sitting
in
front
of
their
computer
logged
on
in
australia
all
inside
of
thirty
minutes
no
airline
or
tardis
for
that
matter
could
ever
match
that
travel
itinerary
the
largest
problem
people
face
when
first
using
a
network
is
grasping
all
that
available
even
seasoned
users
find
themselves
surprised
when
they
discover
a
new
service
or
feature
that
never
known
even
existed
once
acquainted
with
the
terminology
and
sufficiently
comfortable
with
making
occasional
mistakes
the
learning
process
will
drastically
speed
up
domains
getting
where
you
want
to
go
can
often
be
one
of
the
more
difficult
aspects
of
using
networks
the
variety
of
ways
that
places
are
named
will
probably
leave
a
blank
stare
on
your
face
at
first
do
fret
there
is
a
method
to
this
apparent
madness
if
someone
were
to
ask
for
a
home
address
they
would
probably
expect
a
street
apartment
city
state
and
zip
code
that
all
the
information
the
post
office
needs
to
deliver
mail
in
a
reasonably
speedy
fashion
likewise
computer
addresses
have
a
structure
to
them
the
general
form
is
a
person
email
address
on
a
computer
user
a
computer
name
the
user
portion
is
usually
the
person
account
name
on
the
system
though
it
does
have
to
be
tells
you
the
name
of
a
system
or
location
and
what
kind
of
organization
it
is
the
trailing
domain
is
often
one
of
the
following
com
usually
a
company
or
other
commercial
institution
or
organization
like
convex
computers
edu
an
educational
institution
new
york
university
named
gov
a
government
site
for
example
nasa
is
mil
a
military
site
like
the
air
force
net
gateways
and
other
administrative
hosts
for
a
network
it
does
not
mean
all
of
the
hosts
in
a
network
the
matrix
one
such
gateway
is
org
this
is
a
domain
reserved
for
private
organizations
who
comfortably
fit
in
the
other
classes
of
domains
one
example
is
the
electronic
frontier
foundation
named
each
country
also
has
its
own
domain
for
example
the
us
domain
includes
each
of
the
fifty
states
other
countries
represented
with
domains
include
au
australia
ca
canada
fr
france
uk
the
united
kingdom
these
also
have
of
things
like
for
academic
sites
and
for
commercial
ones
fqdn
fully
qualified
domain
name
the
proper
terminology
for
a
site
domain
name
above
is
its
fully
qualified
domain
name
fqdn
it
is
usually
selected
to
give
a
clear
indication
of
the
site
organization
or
sponsoring
agent
for
example
the
massachusetts
institute
of
technology
fqdn
is
similarly
apple
computer
domain
name
is
while
such
obvious
names
are
usually
the
norm
there
are
the
occasional
exceptions
that
are
ambiguous
enough
to
mislead
which
on
first
impulse
one
might
surmise
is
an
educational
institution
of
some
sort
in
vermont
not
so
actually
the
domain
name
for
virginia
tech
in
most
cases
relatively
easy
to
glean
the
meaning
of
a
domain
name
confusion
is
far
from
the
norm
internet
numbers
every
single
machine
on
the
internet
has
a
unique
address
at
least
one
address
possibly
two
or
even
three
we
wo
go
into
that
called
its
internet
number
or
ip
address
it
actually
a
number
but
is
most
commonly
represented
as
four
numbers
joined
by
periods
like
this
is
sometimes
also
called
a
dotted
quad
there
are
literally
thousands
of
different
possible
dotted
quads
the
arpanet
the
mother
to
today
internet
originally
only
had
the
capacity
to
have
up
to
systems
on
it
because
of
the
way
each
system
was
addressed
in
the
early
eighties
it
became
clear
that
things
would
fast
outgrow
such
a
small
limit
the
addressing
method
was
born
freeing
thousands
of
host
numbers
each
piece
of
an
internet
address
like
is
called
an
octet
representing
one
of
four
sets
of
eight
bits
the
first
two
or
three
pieces
represent
the
network
that
a
system
is
on
called
its
subnet
for
example
all
of
the
computers
for
wesleyan
university
are
in
the
subnet
they
can
have
numbers
like
up
to
thousand
possible
combinations
possible
computers
ip
addresses
and
domain
names
are
assigned
arbitrarily
would
lead
to
unbelievable
confusion
an
application
must
be
filed
with
the
network
information
center
nic
either
electronically
to
hostmaster
or
via
regular
mail
resolving
names
and
numbers
ok
computers
can
be
referred
to
by
either
their
fqdn
or
their
internet
address
how
can
one
user
be
expected
to
remember
them
all
they
are
the
internet
is
designed
so
that
one
can
use
either
method
since
humans
find
it
much
more
natural
to
deal
with
words
than
numbers
in
most
cases
the
fqdn
for
each
host
is
mapped
to
its
internet
number
each
domain
is
served
by
a
computer
within
that
domain
which
provides
all
of
the
necessary
information
to
go
from
a
domain
name
to
an
ip
address
and
for
example
when
someone
refers
to
the
resolver
knows
that
it
should
ask
the
system
about
systems
in
it
asks
what
internet
address
has
if
the
name
really
exists
foovax
will
send
back
its
number
all
of
this
magic
happens
behind
the
scenes
rarely
will
a
user
have
to
remember
the
internet
number
of
a
site
although
often
you
catch
yourself
remembering
an
apparently
obscure
number
simply
because
you
accessed
the
system
frequently
however
you
will
remember
a
substantial
number
of
fqdns
it
will
eventually
reach
a
point
when
you
are
able
to
make
a
reasonably
accurate
guess
at
what
domain
name
a
certain
college
university
or
company
might
have
given
just
their
name
the
networks
internet
the
internet
is
a
large
network
of
networks
there
is
no
one
network
known
as
the
internet
rather
regional
nets
like
suranet
prepnet
nearnet
et
are
all
nay
together
into
one
great
living
thing
communicating
at
amazing
speeds
with
the
protocol
all
activity
takes
place
in
uucp
the
uucp
network
is
a
loose
association
of
systems
all
communicating
with
the
uucp
protocol
uucp
stands
for
copy
program
it
based
on
two
systems
connecting
to
each
other
at
specified
intervals
called
polling
and
executing
any
work
scheduled
for
either
of
them
historically
most
uucp
was
done
with
unix
equipment
although
the
software
since
been
implemented
on
other
platforms
vms
for
example
the
system
oregano
polls
the
system
basil
once
every
two
hours
if
there
any
mail
waiting
for
oregano
basil
will
send
it
at
that
time
likewise
oregano
will
at
that
time
send
any
jobs
waiting
for
basil
bitnet
bitnet
the
because
it
time
network
is
comprised
of
systems
connected
by
links
all
running
the
nje
protocol
it
continued
to
grow
but
has
found
itself
suffering
at
the
hands
of
the
falling
costs
of
internet
connections
also
a
number
of
mail
gateways
are
in
place
to
reach
users
on
other
networks
the
physical
connection
the
actual
connections
between
the
various
networks
take
a
variety
of
forms
the
most
prevalent
for
internet
links
are
leased
lines
dedicated
telephone
lines
carrying
connections
and
links
special
phone
lines
with
connections
also
installed
are
links
acting
as
backbones
between
major
locations
to
carry
a
massive
load
of
traffic
these
links
are
paid
for
by
each
institution
to
a
local
carrier
for
example
bell
atlantic
owns
prepnet
the
main
provider
in
pennsylvania
also
available
are
slip
connections
which
carry
internet
traffic
packets
over
modems
uucp
links
are
made
with
modems
for
the
most
part
that
run
from
baud
all
the
way
up
to
as
high
as
as
was
mentioned
in
the
networks
the
connections
are
of
the
variety
also
in
use
are
uucp
links
as
if
things
were
already
confusing
enough
the
systems
do
their
uucp
traffic
over
connections
which
give
the
network
some
blindingly
fast
hops
resulting
in
better
connectivity
for
the
network
as
a
whole
uucp
connections
first
became
popular
in
the
and
have
remained
in
use
ever
since
only
with
uucp
can
joe
smith
correspond
with
someone
across
the
country
or
around
the
world
for
the
price
of
a
local
telephone
call
bitnet
links
mostly
take
the
form
of
modems
connected
from
site
to
site
often
places
have
three
or
more
links
going
the
majority
however
look
to
upstream
sites
for
their
sole
link
to
the
network
the
glory
and
the
nothing
of
a
name
byron
churchill
grave
electronic
mail
the
desire
to
communicate
is
the
essence
of
networking
people
have
always
wanted
to
correspond
with
each
other
in
the
fastest
way
possible
short
of
normal
conversation
electronic
mail
or
email
is
the
most
prevalent
application
of
this
in
computer
networking
it
allows
people
to
write
back
and
forth
without
having
to
spend
much
time
worrying
about
how
the
message
actually
gets
delivered
as
technology
grows
closer
and
closer
to
being
a
common
part
of
daily
life
the
need
to
understand
the
many
ways
it
can
be
utilized
and
how
it
works
at
least
to
some
level
is
vital
part
of
daily
life
as
has
been
evidenced
by
the
isdn
effort
the
need
to
understand
the
many
ways
it
can
be
utilized
and
how
it
works
at
least
to
some
level
is
vital
email
addresses
electronic
mail
is
hinged
around
the
concept
of
an
address
the
section
on
networking
basics
made
some
reference
to
it
while
introducing
domains
your
email
address
provides
all
of
the
information
required
to
get
a
message
to
you
from
anywhere
in
the
world
an
address
does
necessarily
have
to
go
to
a
human
being
it
could
be
an
archive
server
see
archive
servers
for
a
description
a
list
of
people
or
even
someone
pocket
pager
these
cases
are
the
exception
to
the
norm
to
most
addresses
is
read
by
human
beings
symbolic
cacophony
email
addresses
usually
appear
in
one
of
two
forms
the
internet
format
which
contains
an
at
or
using
the
uucp
format
which
contains
an
exclamation
point
also
called
a
bang
the
latter
of
the
two
uucp
bang
paths
is
more
restrictive
yet
more
clearly
dictates
how
the
mail
will
travel
to
reach
jim
morrison
on
the
system
one
would
address
the
mail
as
jm
but
if
jim
account
was
on
a
uucp
site
named
brazil
then
his
address
would
be
brazil
jm
if
it
possible
and
one
exists
try
to
use
the
internet
form
of
an
address
bang
paths
can
fail
if
an
intermediate
site
in
the
path
happens
to
be
down
there
is
a
growing
trend
for
uucp
sites
to
register
internet
domain
names
to
help
alleviate
the
problem
of
path
failures
another
symbol
that
enters
the
fray
is
acts
as
an
extra
routing
method
for
example
if
the
uucp
site
dream
is
connected
to
but
does
have
an
internet
domain
name
of
its
own
a
user
debbie
on
dream
can
be
reached
by
writing
to
the
address
not
smallexample
debbie
dream
the
form
is
significant
this
address
says
that
the
local
system
should
first
send
the
mail
to
there
the
address
debbie
dream
will
turn
into
debbie
dream
which
will
hopefully
be
a
valid
address
then
will
handle
getting
the
mail
to

a
mail
message
on
a
unix
system
check
with
your
system
administrator
for
specific
instructions
related
to
mail
at
your

a
person
sending
the
author
mail
would
probably
do
something
like
this
mail
brendan
subject
print
job
stuck
i
typed
and
it
did
work
why
the
next
time
the
author
checked
his

he
would
see
it
listed
in
his

as

may
print
job
stuck
which
gives
information
on
the
sender
of
the
email
when
it
was
sent
and
the
subject
of
the
message
he
would
probably
use
the
reply
command
of
unix
mail
to
send
this

anatomy
of
a
mail
header
an
electronic
mail
message
has
a
specific
structure
to
it
common
across
every
type
of
computer
system
the
standard
is
written
down
in
see
also
rfcs
for
more
info
on
how
to
get
copies
of
the
various
rfcs
a
sample
would
be
from
bush
sat
may
received
from
by
with
smtp
id
for
dan
sat
may
date
sat
may
from
the
president
bush
to
dan
subject
meeting
hi
dan
we
have
a
meeting
at
with
the
joint
chiefs
please
do
oversleep
this
time
the
first
line
with
from
and
the
two
lines
for
received
are
usually
not
very
interesting
they
give
the
real
address
that
the
mail
is
coming
from
as
opposed
to
the
address
you
should
reply
to
which
may
look
much
different
and
what
places
the
mail
went
through
to
get
to
you
over
the
internet
there
is
always
at
least
one
received
header
and
usually
no
more
than
four
or
five
when
a
message
is
sent
using
uucp
one
received
header
is
added
for
each
system
that
the
mail
passes
through
this
can
often
result
in
more
than
a
dozen
received
headers
while
they
help
with
dissecting
problems
in
mail
delivery
odds
are
the
average
user
will
never
want
to
see
them
most
mail
programs
will
filter
out
this
kind
of
cruft
in
a
header
the
date
header
contains
the
date
and
time
the
message
was
sent
likewise
the
good
address
as
opposed
to
real
address
is
laid
out
in
the
from
header
sometimes
it
wo
include
the
full
name
of
the
person
in
this
case
the
president
and
may
look
different
but
it
should
always
contain
an
email
address
of
some
form
the
of
a
message
is
intended
mainly
for
tracing
mail
routing
and
is
rarely
of
interest
to
normal
users
every
is
guaranteed
to
be
unique
to
lists
the
email
address
or
addresses
of
the
recipients
of
the
message
there
may
be
a
cc
header
listing
additional
addresses
finally
a
brief
subject
for
the
message
goes
in
the
subject
header
the
exact
order
of
a
message
headers
may
vary
from
system
to
system
but
it
will
always
include
these
fundamental
headers
that
are
vital
to
proper
delivery
bounced
mail
when
an
email
address
is
incorrect
in
some
way
the
system
name
is
wrong
the
domain
does
exist
whatever
the
mail
system
will
bounce
the
message
back
to
the
sender
much
the
same
way
that
the
postal
service
does
when
you
send
a
letter
to
a
bad
street
address
the
message
will
include
the
reason
for
the
bounce
a
common
error
is
addressing
mail
to
an
account
name
that
does
exist
for
example
writing
to
lisa
simpson
at
widener
university
computer
science

will
fail
because
she
does
have
an

though
if
she

mailing
lists
people
that
share
common
interests
are
inclined
to
discuss
their
hobby
or
interest
at
every
available
opportunity
one
modern
way
to
aid
in
this
exchange
of
information
is
by
using
a
mailing
list
an
email
address
that
redistributes
all
mail
sent
to
it
back
out
to
a
list
of
addresses
for
example
the
sun
managers
mailing
list
of
interest
to
people
that
administer
computers
manufactured
by
sun
has
the
address
any
mail
sent
to
that
address
will
explode
out
to
each
person
named
in
a
file
maintained
on
a
computer
at
northwestern
university
administrative
tasks
sometimes
referred
to
as
administrivia
are
often
handled
through
other
addresses
typically
with
the
suffix
to
continue
the
above
a
request
to
be
added
to
or
deleted
from
the
sun
managers
list
should
be
sent
to
when
in
doubt
try
to
write
to
the
version
of
a
mailing
list
address
first
the
other
people
on
the
list
are
interested
in
your
desire
to
be
added
or
deleted
and
can
certainly
do
nothing
to
expedite
your
request
often
if
the
administrator
of
a
list
is
busy
remember
this
is
all
peripheral
to
real
jobs
and
real
work
many
users
find
it
necessary
to
ask
again
and
again
often
with
harsher
and
harsher
language
to
be
removed
from
a
list
this
does
nothing
more
than
waste
traffic
and
bother
everyone
else
receiving
the
messages
if
after
a
reasonable
amount
of
time
you
still
succeeded
to
be
removed
from
a
mailing
list
write
to
the
postmaster
at
that
site
and
see
if
they
can
help
exercise
caution
when
replying
to
a
message
sent
by
a
mailing
list
if
you
wish
to
respond
to
the
author
only
make
sure
that
the
only
address
you
replying
to
is
that
person
and
not
the
entire
list
often
messages
of
the
sort
yes
i
agree
with
you
completely
will
appear
on
a
list
boring
the
daylights
out
of
the
other
readers
likewise
if
you
explicitly
do
want
to
send
the
message
to
the
whole
list
you
save
yourself
some
time
by
checking
to
make
sure
it
indeed
headed
to
the
whole
list
and
not
a
single
person
a
list
of
the
currently
available
mailing
lists
is
available
in
at
least
two
places
the
first
is
in
a
file
on
called
under
the
directory
it
updated
fairly
regularly
but
is
large
presently
around
so
only
get
it
every
once
in
a
while
the
other
list
is
maintained
by
gene
spafford
spaf
and
is
posted
in
parts
to
the
newsgroup
usenet
news
for
info
on
how
to
read
that
and
other
newsgroups
listservs
on
bitnet
there
an
automated
system
for
maintaining
discussion
lists
called
the
listserv
rather
than
have
an
already
harried
and
overworked
human
take
care
of
additions
and
removals
from
a
list
a
program
performs
these
and
other
tasks
by
responding
to
a
set
of
commands
areas
of
interest
are
wide
and
varied
deals
with
ethics
in
computing
while
has
to
do
with
a

a
full
list
of
the
available
bitnet
lists
can
be
obtained
by
writing
to
listserv
with
a
body
containing
the
command
list
global
however
be
sparing
in
your
use
of
this
if
it
already
on
your
system
somewhere
the
reply
is
quite
large
the
most
fundamental
command
is
subscribe
it
will
tell
the
listserv
to
add
the
sender
to
a
specific
list
the
usage
is
subscribe
your
real
name
it
will
respond
with
a
message
either
saying
that
you
been
added
to
the
list
or
that
the
request
has
been
passed
on
to
the
system
on
which
the
list
is
actually
maintained
the
mate
to
subscribe
is
naturally
unsubscribe
it
will
remove
a
given
address
from
a
bitnet
list
it
along
with
all
other
listserv
commands
can
be

anonymous
ftp
ftp
file
transfer
protocol
is
the
primary
method
of
transferring
files
over
the
internet
on
many
systems
it
also
the
name
of
the
program
that
implements
the
protocol
given
proper
permission
possible
to
copy
a
file
from
a
computer
in
south
africa
to
one
in
los
angeles
at
very
fast
speeds
on
the
order
of
per
second
this
normally
requires
either
a
user
id
on
both
systems
or
a
special
configuration
set
up
by
the
system
administrator
s
there
is
a
good
way
around
this
restriction
anonymous
ftp
service
it
essentially
will
let
anyone
in
the
world
have
access
to
a
certain
area
of
disk
space
in
a
way
with
this
people
can
make
files
publicly
available
with
little
hassle
some
systems
have
dedicated
entire
disks
or
even
entire
computers
to
maintaining
extensive
archives
of
source
code
and
information
they
include
digital
washington
university
in
saint
louis
and
the
ohio
state
university
the
process
involves
the
foreign
user
someone
not
on
the
system
itself
creating
an
ftp
connection
and
logging
into
the
system
as
the
user
anonymous
with
an
arbitrary
password
name
you
anonymous
password
jm
custom
and
netiquette
dictate
that
people
respond
to
the
password
query
with
an
email
address
so
that
the
sites
can
track
the
level
of
ftp
usage
if
they
desire
addresses
for
information
on
email
addresses
the
speed
of
the
transfer
depends
on
the
speed
of
the
underlying
link
a
site
that
has
a
slip
connection
will
not
get
the
same
throughput
as
a
system
with
a
leased
line
the
physical
connection
for
more
on
what
kinds
of
connections
can
exist
in
a
network
also
the
traffic
of
all
other
users
on
that
link
will
affect
performance
if
there
are
thirty
people
all
ftping
from
one
site
simultaneously
the
load
on
the
system
in
addition
to
the
network
connection
will
degrade
the
overall
throughput
of
the
transfer
ftp
etiquette
lest
we
forget
the
internet
is
there
for
people
to
do
work
people
using
the
network
and
the
systems
on
it
are
doing
so
for
a
purpose
whether
it
be
research
development
whatever
any
heavy
activity
takes
away
from
the
overall
performance
of
the
network
as
a
whole
the
effects
of
an
ftp
connection
on
a
site
and
its
link
can
vary
the
general
rule
of
thumb
is
that
any
extra
traffic
created
detracts
from
the
ability
of
that
site
users
to
perform
their
tasks
to
help
be
considerate
of
this
it
highly
recommended
that
ftp
sessions
be
held
only
after
normal
business
hours
for
that
site
preferably
late
at
night
the
possible
effects
of
a
large
transfer
will
be
less
destructive
at
than
also
remember
that
if
it
past
dinner
time
in
maine
it
still
early
afternoon
in
california
in
terms
of
the
current
time
at
the
site
that
being
visited
not
of
local
time
basic
commands
while
there
have
been
many
extensions
to
the
various
ftp
clients
out
there
there
is
a
de
facto
standard
set
that
everyone
expects
to
work
for
more
specific
information
read
the
manual
for
your
specific
ftp
program
this
section
will
only
skim
the
bare
minimum
of
commands
needed
to
operate
an
ftp
session
creating
the
connection
the
actual
command
to
use
ftp
will
vary
among
operating
systems
for
the
sake
of
clarity
we
use
ftp
here
since
it
the
most
general
form
there
are
two
ways
to
connect
to
a
system
its
hostname
or
its
internet
number
using
the
hostname
is
usually
preferred
however
some
sites
are
able
to
resolve
hostnames
properly
and
have
no
alternative
we
assume
you
able
to
use
hostnames
for
simplicity
sake
the
form
is
ftp
domains
for
help
with
reading
and
using
domain
names
in
the
example
below
is
you
must
first
know
the
name
of
the
system
you
want
to
connect
to
we
use
as
an
example
on
your
system
type
ftp
the
actual
syntax
will
vary
depending
on
the
type
of
system
the
connection
being
made
from
it
will
pause
momentarily
then
respond
with
the
message
connected
to
and
an
initial
prompt
will
appear
uunet
ftp
server
version
mon
feb
est
ready
name
jm
to
which
you
should
respond
with
anonymous
uunet
ftp
server
version
mon
feb
est
ready
name
jm
anonymous
the
system
will
then
prompt
you
for
a
password
as
noted
previously
a
good
response
is
your
email
address
guest
login
ok
send
ident
as
password
password
jm
guest
login
ok
access
restrictions
apply
ftp
the
password
itself
will
not
echo
this
is
to
protect
a
security
when
he
or
she
is
using
a
real
account
to
ftp
files
between
machines
once
you
reach
the
ftp
prompt
you
know
logged
in
and
ready
to
go
notice
the
joe
in
the
name
prompt
another
clue
that
anonymous
ftp
is
special
ftp
expects
a
normal
user
accounts
to
be
used
for
transfers
dir
at
the
ftp
prompt
you
can
type
a
number
of
commands
to
perform
various
functions
one
example
is
dir
will
list
the
files
in
the
current
directory
continuing
the
example
from
above
ftp
dir
port
command
successful
opening
ascii
mode
data

nov

clarinet
etc
etc

etc
may
may
transfer

bytes
received
in
seconds
ftp
the
file
was
specifically
included
because
be
using
it
later
just
for
general
information
it
happens
to
be
a
listing
of
all
of
the
files
added
to
uunet
archives
during
the
past
week
the
directory
shown
is
on
a
machine
running
the
unix
operating
system
dir
command
will
produce
different
results
on
other
operating
systems
tops
vms
et
learning
to
recognize
different
formats
will
take
some
time
after
a
few
weeks
of
traversing
the
internet
it
proves
easier
to
see
for
example
how
large
a
file
is
on
an
operating
system
you
otherwise
not
acquainted
with
with
many
ftp
implementations
it
also
possible
to
take
the
output
of
dir
and
put
it
into
a
file
on
the
local
system
with
ftp
dir
outfilename
the
contents
of
which
can
then
be
read
outside
of
the
live
ftp
connection
this
is
particularly
useful
for
systems
with
very
long
directories
like
the
above
example
would
put
the
names
of
every
file
that
begins
with
an
n
into
the
local
file
outfilename
cd
at
the
beginning
of
an
ftp
session
the
user
is
in
a
directory
most
things
are
in
directories
below
it
to
change
the
current
directory
one
uses
the
cd
command
to
change
to
the
directory
pub
for
example
one
would
type
ftp
cd
pub
which
would
elicit
the
response
cwd
command
successful
meaning
the
change
working
directory
command
cd
worked
properly
moving
up
a
directory

the

is
performed
with
the
get
and
put
commands
to
get
a
file
from
the
remote
computer
to
the
local
system
the
command
takes
the
form
ftp
get
filename
where
filename
is
the
file
on
the
remote
system
again
using
as
an
example
the
file
can
be
retrieved
with
ftp

the
section
below
on
using
binary
mode
instead
of
ascii
will
describe
why
this
particular
choice
will
result
in
a
corrupt
and
subsequently
unusable
file
if
for
some
reason
you
want
to
save
a
file
under
a
different
name
your
system
can
only
have
filenames
or
can
only
have
one
dot
in
the
name
you
can
specify
what
the
local
filename
should
be
by
providing
get
with
an
additional
argument
ftp
get
which
will
place
the
contents
of
the
file
in
on
the
local
system
the
transfer
works
the
other
way
too
the
put
command
will
transfer
a
file
from
the
local
system
to
the
remote
system
if
the
permissions
are
set
up
for
an
ftp
session
to
write
to
a
remote
directory
a
file
can
be
sent
with
ftp
put
filename
as
with
get
put
will
take
a
third
argument
letting
you
specify
a
different
name
for
the
file
on
the
remote
system
ascii
vs
binary
in
the
example
above
the
file
was
transferred
but
supposedly
not
correctly
the
reason
is
this
in
a
normal
ascii
transfer
the
default
certain
characters
are
translated
between
systems
to
help
make
text
files
more
readable
however
when
binary
files
those
containing
characters
are
transferred
this
translation
should
not
take
place
one
example
is
a
binary
program
few
changed
characters
can
render
it
completely
useless
to
avoid
this
problem
it
possible
to
be
in
one
of
two
modes
or
binary
in
binary
mode
the
file
is
translated
in
any
way
what
on
the
remote
system
is
precisely
what
received
the
commands
to
go
between
the
two
modes
are
ftp
ascii
type
set
to
a
note
the
a
which
signifies
ascii
mode
ftp
binary
type
set
to
i
set
to
image
format
for
pure
binary
transfers
note
that
each
command
need
only
be
done
once
to
take
effect
if
the
user
types
binary
all
transfers
in
that
session
are
done
in
binary
mode
that
is
unless
ascii
is
typed
later
the
transfer
of
will
work
if
done
as
ftp
binary
type
set
to
ftp
get
port
command
successful
opening
binary
mode
data
connection
for
bytes
transfer
complete
local
remote
bytes
received
in
seconds
note
the
file
size
is
different
from
that
done
in
ascii
mode
bytes
and
the
number
matches
the
one
in
the
listing
of
uunet
top
directory
we
can
be
relatively
sure
that
we
received
the
file
without
any
problems
mget
and
mput
the
commands
mget
and
mput
allow
for
multiple
file
transfers
using
wildcards
to
get
several
files
or
a
whole
set
of
files
at
once
rather
than
having
to
do
it
manually
one
by
one
for
example
to
get
all
files
that
begin
with
the
letter
f
one
would
type
ftp
mget
similarly
to
put
all
of
the
local
files
that
end
with
ftp
mput
rather
than
reiterate
what
been
written
a
hundred
times
before
consult
a
local
manual
for
more
information
on

normally
ftp
assumes
a
user
wants
to
be
prompted
for

in
a

operation
you
often
need
to

the
first
thing
to
understand
about
usenet
is
that
it
is
widely
misunderstood
every
day
on
usenet
the
blind
men
and
the
elephant
phenomenon
appears
in
spades
in
the
opinion
of
the
author
more
flame
wars
rabid
arguments
arise
because
of
a
lack
of
understanding
of
the
nature
of
usenet
than
from
any
other
source
and
consider
that
such
flame
wars
arise
of
necessity
among
people
who
are
on
usenet
imagine
then
how
poorly
understood
usenet
must
be
by
those
outside
no
essay
on
the
nature
of
usenet
can
ignore
the
erroneous
impressions
held
by
many
usenet
users
therefore
this
section
will
treat
falsehoods
first
keep
reading
for
truth
beauty
alas
is
not
relevant
to
usenet
what
usenet
is
usenet
is
the
set
of
machines
that
exchange
articles
tagged
with
one
or
more
labels
called
newsgroups
or
groups
for
short
note
that
the
term
newsgroup
is
correct
while
area
base
board
bboard
conference
round
table
sig
etc
are
incorrect
if
you
want
to
be
understood
be
accurate
the
diversity
of
usenet
if
the
above
definition
of
usenet
sounds
vague
that
because
it
is
it
is
almost
impossible
to
generalize
over
all
usenet
sites
in
any
way
usenet
encompasses
government
agencies
large
universities
high
schools
businesses
of
all
sizes
home
computers
of
all
descriptions
etc
every
administrator
controls
his
own
site
no
one
has
any
real
control
over
any
site
but
his
own
the
administrator
gets
his
power
from
the
owner
of
the
system
he
administers
as
long
as
the
owner
is
happy
with
the
job
the
administrator
is
doing
he
can
do
whatever
he
pleases
up
to
and
including
cutting
off
usenet
entirely
la
vie
what
usenet
is
not
usenet
is
not
an
organization
usenet
has
no
central
authority
in
fact
it
has
no
central
anything
there
is
a
vague
notion
of
upstream
and
downstream
related
to
the
direction
of
news
flow
it
follows
that
to
the
extent
that
upstream
sites
decide
what
traffic
they
will
carry
for
their
downstream
neighbors
that
upstream
sites
have
some
influence
on
their
neighbors
but
such
influence
is
usually
easy
to
circumvent
and
manipulation
typically
results
in
a
backlash
of
resentment
usenet
is
not
a
democracy
a
democracy
can
be
loosely
defined
as
government
of
the
people
by
the
people
for
the
people
however
as
explained
above
usenet
is
not
an
organization
and
only
an
organization
can
be
run
as
a
democracy
even
a
democracy
must
be
organized
for
if
it
lacks
a
means
of
enforcing
the
peoples
wishes
then
it
may
as
well
not
exist
some
people
wish
that
usenet
were
a
democracy
many
people
pretend
that
it
is
both
groups
are
sadly
deluded
usenet
is
not
fair
after
all
who
shall
decide
what
fair
for
that
matter
if
someone
is
behaving
unfairly
who
going
to
stop
him
neither
you
nor
i
that
certain
usenet
is
not
a
right
some
people
misunderstand
their
local
right
of
freedom
of
speech
to
mean
that
they
have
a
legal
right
to
use
others
computers
to
say
what
they
wish
in
whatever
way
they
wish
and
the
owners
of
said
computers
have
no
right
to
stop
them
those
people
are
wrong
freedom
of
speech
also
means
freedom
not
to
speak
if
i
choose
not
to
use
my
computer
to
aid
your
speech
that
is
my
right
freedom
of
the
press
belongs
to
those
who
own
one
usenet
is
not
a
public
utility
some
usenet
sites
are
publicly
funded
or
subsidized
most
of
them
by
plain
count
are
not
there
is
no
government
monopoly
on
usenet
and
little
or
no
control
usenet
is
not
a
commercial
network
many
usenet
sites
are
academic
or
government
organizations
in
fact
usenet
originated
in
academia
therefore
there
is
a
usenet
custom
of
keeping
commercial
traffic
to
a
minimum
if
such
commercial
traffic
is
generally
considered
worth
carrying
then
it
may
be
grudgingly
tolerated
even
so
it
is
usually
separated
somehow
from
traffic
see
usenet
is
not
the
internet
the
internet
is
a
network
parts
of
which
are
subsidized
by
various
governments
the
internet
carries
many
kinds
of
traffic
usenet
is
only
one
of
them
and
the
internet
is
only
one
of
the
various
networks
carrying
usenet
traffic
usenet
is
not
a
unix
network
nor
even
an
ascii
network
do
assume
that
everyone
is
using
rn
on
a
unix
machine
there
are
vaxen
running
vms
ibm
mainframes
amigas
and
pcs
reading
and
posting
to
usenet
and
yes
some
of
them
use
shudder
ebcdic
ignore
them
if
you
like
but
they
out
there
usenet
is
not
software
there
are
dozens
of
software
packages
used
at
various
sites
to
transport
and
read
usenet
articles
so
no
one
program
or
package
can
be
called
the
usenet
software
software
designed
to
support
usenet
traffic
can
be
and
is
used
for
other
kinds
of
communication
usually
without
risk
of
mixing
the
two
such
private
communication
networks
are
typically
kept
distinct
from
usenet
by
the
invention
of
newsgroup
names
different
from
the
ones
usenet
is
not
a
uucp
network
uucp
is
a
protocol
some
might
say
protocol
suite
but
that
a
technical
point
for
sending
data
over
connections
typically
using
dialup
modems
usenet
is
only
one
of
the
various
kinds
of
traffic
carried
via
uucp
and
uucp
is
only
one
of
the
various
transports
carrying
usenet
traffic
well
enough
negativity
propagation
of
news
in
the
old
days
when
uucp
over
dialup
lines
was
the
dominant
means
of
article
transmission
a
few
sites
had
real
influence
in
determining
which
newsgroups
would
be
carried
where
those
sites
called
themselves
the
backbone
but
things
have
changed
nowadays
even
the
smallest
internet
site
has
connectivity
the
likes
of
which
the
backbone
admin
of
yesteryear
could
only
dream
in
addition
in
the
the
advent
of
cheaper
calls
and
modems
has
made
usenet
feeds
thinkable
for
smaller
companies
there
is
only
one
uucp
transport
site
today
in
the
namely
uunet
but
uunet
is
a
player
in
the
propagation
wars
because
it
never
refuses
any
traffic
gets
paid
by
the
minute
after
all
to
refuse
based
on
content
would
jeopardize
its
legal
status
as
an
enhanced
service
provider
all
of
the
above
applies
to
the
in
europe
different
cost
structures
favored
the
creation
of
strictly
controlled
hierarchical
organizations
with
central
registries
this
is
all
very
unlike
the
traditional
mode
of
sites
pick
a
name
get
the
software
get
a
feed
you
on
europe
benign
monopolies
long
uncontested
now
face
competition
from
looser
organizations
patterned
after
the
model
group
creation
as
discussed
above
usenet
is
not
a
democracy
nevertheless
currently
the
most
popular
way
to
create
a
new
newsgroup
involves
a
vote
to
determine
popular
support
for
and
opposition
to
a
proposed
newsgroup
newsgroup
creation
for
detailed
instructions
and
guidelines
on
the
process
involved
in
making
a
newsgroup
if
you
follow
the
guidelines
it
is
probable
that
your
group
will
be
created
and
will
be
widely
propagated
however
due
to
the
nature
of
usenet
there
is
no
way
for
any
user
to
enforce
the
results
of
a
newsgroup
vote
or
any
other
decision
for
that
matter
therefore
for
your
new
newsgroup
to
be
propagated
widely
you
must
not
only
follow
the
letter
of
the
guidelines
you
must
also
follow
its
spirit
and
you
must
not
allow
even
a
whiff
of
shady
dealings
or
dirty
tricks
to
mar
the
vote
so
you
may
ask
how
is
a
new
user
supposed
to
know
anything
about
the
spirit
of
the
guidelines
obviously
she
ca
this
fact
leads
inexorably
to
the
following
recommendation
if
you
a
new
user
do
try
to
create
a
new
newsgroup
alone
if
you
have
a
good
newsgroup
idea
then
read
the
newsgroup
for
a
while
six
months
at
least
to
find
out
how
things
work
if
you
too
impatient
to
wait
six
months
then
you
really
need
to
learn
read
for
a
year
instead
if
you
just
ca
wait
find
a
usenet
old
hand
to
run
the
vote
for
you
readers
may
think
this
advice
unnecessarily
strict
ignore
it
at
your
peril
it
is
embarrassing
to
speak
before
learning
it
is
foolish
to
jump
into
a
society
you
do
understand
with
your
mouth
open
and
it
is
futile
to
try
to
force
your
will
on
people
who
can
tune
you
out
with
the
press
of
a
key
if
you
unhappy
property
rights
being
what
they
are
there
is
no
higher
authority
on
usenet
than
the
people
who
own
the
machines
on
which
usenet
traffic
is
carried
if
the
owner
of
the
machine
you
use
says
we
will
not
carry
on
this
machine
and
you
are
not
happy
with
that
order
you
have
no
usenet
recourse
what
can
we
outsiders
do
after
all
that
does
mean
you
are
without
options
depending
on
the
nature
of
your
site
you
may
have
some
internal
political
recourse
or
you
might
find
external
pressure
helpful
or
with
a
minimal
investment
you
can
get
a
feed
of
your
own
from
somewhere
else
computers
capable
of
taking
usenet
feeds
are
down
in
the
range
now
boxes
are
going
for
under
and
there
are
at
least
two
unix
lookalikes
in
the
price
range
no
matter
what
appealing
to
usenet
wo
help
even
if
those
who
read
such
an
appeal
regarding
system
administration
are
sympathetic
to
your
cause
they
will
almost
certainly
have
even
less
influence
at
your
site
than
you
do
by
the
same
token
if
you
do
like
what
some
user
at
another
site
is
doing
only
the
administrator
owner
of
that
site
have
any
authority
to
do
anything
about
it
persuade
them
that
the
user
in
question
is
a
problem
for
them
and
they
might
do
something
if
they
feel
like
it
if
the
user
in
question
is
the
administrator
or
owner
of
the
site
from
which
he
or
she
posts
forget
it
you
ca
win
arrange
for
your
newsreading
software
to
ignore
articles
from
him
or
her
if
you
can
and
chalk
one
up
to
experience
the
history
of
usenet
the
abcs
in
the
beginning
there
were
conversations
and
they
were
good
then
came
usenet
in
shortly
after
the
release
of
unix
with
uucp
and
it
was
better
two
duke
university
grad
students
in
north
carolina
tom
truscott
and
jim
ellis
thought
of
hooking
computers
together
to
exchange
information
with
the
unix
community
steve
bellovin
a
grad
student
at
the
university
of
north
carolina
put
together
the
first
version
of
the
news
software
using
shell
scripts
and
installed
it
on
the
first
two
sites
unc
and
duke
at
the
beginning
of
the
network
consisted
of
those
two
sites
and
phs
another
machine
at
duke
and
was
described
at
the
january
usenix
conference
in
boulder
the
usenix
conferences
are
meetings
where
members
of
the
usenix
association
a
group
of
unix
enthusiasts
meet
and
trade
notes
steve
bellovin
later
rewrote
the
scripts
into
c
programs
but
they
were
never
released
beyond
unc
and
duke
shortly
thereafter
steve
daniel
did
another
implementation
in
the
c
programming
language
for
public
distribution
tom
truscott
made
further
modifications
and
this
became
the
a
news
release
in
at
the
university
of
california
at
berkeley
grad
student
mark
horton
and
high
school
student
matt
glickman
rewrote
the
news
software
to
add
functionality
and
to
cope
with
the
ever
increasing
volume
of
news
a
news
was
intended
for
only
a
few
articles
per
group
per
day
this
rewrite
was
the
b
news
version
the
first
public
release
was
version
in
all
versions
before
were
considered
in
beta
test
as
the
net
grew
the
news
software
was
expanded
and
modified
the
last
version
maintained
and
released
primarily
by
mark
was
rick
adams
then
at
the
center
for
seismic
studies
took
over
coordination
of
the
maintenance
and
enhancement
of
the
news
software
with
the
release
in
by
this
time
the
increasing
volume
of
news
was
becoming
a
concern
and
the
mechanism
for
moderated
groups
was
added
to
the
software
at
moderated
groups
were
inspired
by
arpa
mailing
lists
and
experience
with
other
bulletin
board
systems
in
late
version
of
news
was
released
including
a
number
of
changes
to
support
a
new
naming
structure
for
newsgroups
enhanced
batching
and
compression
enhanced
control
messages
and
other
features
the
current
release
of
news
is
patchlevel
a
new
version
of
news
becoming
known
as
c
news
has
been
developed
at
the
university
of
toronto
by
geoff
collyer
and
henry
spencer
this
version
is
a
rewrite
of
the
lowest
levels
of
news
to
increase
article
processing
speed
decrease
article
expiration
processing
and
improve
the
reliability
of
the
news
system
through
better
locking
etc
the
package
was
released
to
the

the
autumn

usenet

has
also
been
ported
to
a
number
of
platforms
from
the
amiga
and
ibm
pcs
all
the
way
to
minicomputers
and
mainframes
hierarchies
newsgroups
are
organized
according
to
their
specific
areas
of
concentration
since
the
groups
are
in
a
tree
structure
the
various
areas
are
called
hierarchies
there
are
seven
major
categories
comp
topics
of

to
both
computer

these
world
newsgroups
are
usually
circulated
around
the
entire
usenet
implies
distribution
not
all
groups
actually
enjoy
such
wide
distribution
however
the
european
usenet
and
eunet
sites
take
only
a
selected
subset
of
the
more
technical

and
controversial
noise

are
often
not
carried
by
many
sites
in
the

canada
these
groups
are
primarily
under
the
talk
and
soc
classifications
many
sites
do
not
carry
some
or
all
of
the
groups
because
of
the
typically
large
size
of
the

groups
moderated
vs
unmoderated
some
newsgroups
insist
that
the
discussion
remain
focused
and
to
serve
this
need
moderated
groups
came
to
be
all
articles
posted
to
a
moderated
group
get
mailed
to
the
moderator
he
or
she
periodically
hopefully
sooner
than
later
reviews
the
posts
and
then
either
posts
them
individually
to
usenet
or
posts
a
composite
digest
of
the
articles
for
the
past
day
or
two
this
is
how
many
mailing
list
gateways
work
for
example
the
risks
digest
being
a
good
includes
being
involved
in
the
continuing
growth
and
evolution
of
the
usenet
system
one
part
of
this
involvement
includes
following
the
discussion
in
the
groups
and
the
notes
in
it
is
there
that
discussion
goes
on
about
the
creation
of
new
groups
and
destruction
of
inactive
ones
every
person
on
usenet
is
allowed
and
encouraged
to
vote
on
the
creation
of
a
newsgroup
how
usenet
works
the
transmission
of
usenet
news
is
entirely
cooperative
feeds
are
generally
provided
out
of
good
will
and
the
desire
to
distribute
news
everywhere
there
are
places
which
provide
feeds
for
a
fee
uunet
but
for
the
large
part
no
exchange
of
money
is
involved
there
are
two
major
transport
methods
uucp
and
nntp
the
first
is
mainly
and
involves
the
normal
charges
for
telephone
calls
the
second
nntp
is
the
primary
method
for
distributing
news
over
the
internet
with
uucp
news
is
stored
in
batches
on
a
site
until
the
neighbor
calls
to
receive
the
articles
or
the
feed
site
happens
to
call
a
list
of
groups
which
the
neighbor
wishes
to
receive
is
maintained
on
the
feed
site
the
cnews
system
compresses
its
batches
which
can
dramatically
reduce
the
transmission
time
necessary
for
a
relatively
heavy
newsfeed
nntp
on
the
other
hand
offers
a
little
more
latitude
with
how
news
is
sent
the
traditional
method
is
of
course
available
given
the
nature
of
the
internet
though
other
methods
have
been
devised
programs
now
keep
constant
connections
with
their
news
neighbors
sending
news
nearly
instantaneously
and
can
handle
dozens
of
simultaneous
feeds
both
incoming
and
outgoing
the
transmission
of
a
usenet
article
is
centered
around
the
unique
header
when
an
nntp
site
offers
an
article
to
a
neighbor
it
says
it
has
that
specific
message
id
if
the
neighbor
finds
it
has
received
the
article
yet
it
tells
the
feed
to
send
it
through
this
is
repeated
for
each
and
every
article
that
waiting
for
the
neighbor
using
unique
ids
helps
prevent
a
system
from
receiving
five
copies
of
an
article
from
each
of
its
five
news
neighbors
for
example
further
information
on
how
usenet
works
with
relation
to
the
various
transports
is
available
in
the
documentation
for
the
cnews
and
nntp
packages
as
well
as
in
the
standard
for
interchange
of
usenet
messages
and
network
news
transfer
protocol
a
proposed
standard
for
the
transmission
of
news
the
rfcs
do
tend
to
be
rather
dry
reading
particularly
to
the
new
user
mail
gateways
a
natural
progression
is
for
usenet
news
and
electronic
mailing
lists
to
somehow
become
merged
they
have
in
the
form
of
news
gateways
many
mailing
lists
are
set
up
to
reflect
messages
not
only
to
the
readership
of
the
list
but
also
into
a
newsgroup
likewise
posts
to
a
newsgroup
can
be
sent
to
the
moderator
of
the
mailing
list
or
to
the
entire
mailing
list
some
examples
of
this
in
action
are
the
risks
digest
and
the
telecom
digest
this
method
of
propagating
mailing
list
traffic
has
helped
solve
the
problem
of
a
single
message
being
delivered
to
a
number
of
people
at
the
same
site
anyone
can
just
subscribe
to
the
group
also
mailing
list
maintenance
is
lowered
substantially
since
the
moderators
do
have
to
be
constantly
removing
and
adding
users
to
and
from
the
list
instead
the
people
can
read
and
not
read
the
newsgroup
at
their
leisure
from

usenet
netiquette
there
are
many
traditions
with
usenet
not
the
least
of
which
is
dubbed
netiquette
polite
and
considerate
of
others
if
you
follow
a
few
basic
guidelines
you
and
everyone
that
reads
your
posts
will
be
much
happier
in
the
long
run
signatures
at
the
end
of
most
articles
is
a
small
blurb
called
a
signature
in
unix
this
file
is
named
in
the
person
login
directory
will
vary
for
other
operating
systems
it
exists
to
provide
information
about
how
to
get
in
touch
with
the
person
posting
the
article
including
their
email
address
phone
number
address
or
where
they
located
even
so
signatures
have
become
the
graffiti
of
computers
people
put
song
lyrics
pictures
philosophical
quotes
even
advertisements
in
their
note
however
that
advertising
in
your
signature
will
more
often
than
not
get
you
flamed
until
you
take
it
out
four
lines
will
suffice
is
just
extra
garbage
for
usenet
sites
to
carry
along
with
your
article
which
is
supposed
to
be
the
intended
focus
of
the
reader
netiquette
dictates
limiting
oneself
to
this
quota
of
four
people
make
signatures
that
are
ten
lines
or
even
more
including
elaborate
ascii
drawings
of
their
signature
or
faces
or
even
the
space
shuttle
this
is
not
cute
and
will
bother
people
to
no
end
similarly
it
not
necessary
to
include
your
signature
you
forget
to
append
it
to
an
article
do
worry
about
it
the
article
just
as
good
as
it
ever
would
be
and
contains
everything
you
should
want
to
say
do
the
article
just
to
include
the
signature
posting
personal
messages
if
mail
to
a
person
does
make
it
through
avoid
posting
the
message
to
a
newsgroup
even
if
the
likelihood
of
that
person
reading
the
group
is
very
high
all
of
the
other
people
reading
the
articles
give
a
whit
what
you
have
to
say
to
jim
morrison
simply
wait
for
the
person
to
post
again
and
the
address
or
get
in
touch
with
your
system
administrator
and
see
if
it
a
problem
with
local
email
delivery
it
may
also
turn
out
that
their
site
is
down
or
is
having
problems
in
which
case
it
just
necessary
to
wait
until
things
return
to
normal
before
contacting
jim
posting
mail
in
the
interests
of
privacy
it
considered
extremely
bad
taste
to
post
any
email
that
someone
may
have
sent
unless
they
explicitly
give
you
permission
to
redistribute
it
while
the
legal
issues
can
be
heavily
debated
most
everyone
agrees
that
email
should
be
treated
as
anything
one
would
receive
via
normal
snailmail
the
slang
for
the
normal
land
and
air
postal
service
with
all
of
the
assumed
rights
that
are
carried
with
it
test
messages
many
people
particularly
new
users
want
to
try
out
posting
before
actually
taking
part
in
discussions
often
the
mechanics
of
getting
messages
out
is
the
most
difficult
part
of
usenet
to
this
end
many
many
users
find
it
necessary
to
post
their
tests
to
normal
groups
for
example
or
this
is
considered
a
major
netiquette
faux
pas
in
the
usenet
world
there
are
a
number
of
groups
available
called
test
groups
that
exist
solely
for
the
purpose
of
trying
out
a
news
system
reader
or
even
new
signature
they
include
some
of
which
will
generate
replies
to
your
posts
to
let
you
know
they
made
it
through
there
are
certain
denizens
of
usenet
that
frequent
the
test
groups
to
help
new
users
out
they
respond
to
the
posts
often
including
the
article
so
the
poster
can
see
how
it
got
to
the
person
site
also
many
regional
hierarchies
have
test
groups
like
in
philadelphia
by
all
means
experiment
and
test
do
it
in
its
proper
place
famous
people
appearing
every
once
in
a
while
someone
says
that
a
celebrity
is
accessible
through
the
net
or
even
more
entertaining
an
article
is
forged
to
appear
to
be
coming
from
that
celebrity
one
example
is
stephen
spielberg
readership
was
in
an
uproar
for
two
weeks
following
a
couple
of
posts
supposedly
made
by
spielberg
some
detective
work
revealed
it
to
be
a
hoax
there
are
a
few
people
that
are
acquainted
with
usenet
and
computers
in
general
the
overwhelming
majority
are
just
normal
people
one
should
act
with
skepticism
whenever
a
notable
personality
is
seen
in
a
newsgroup
summaries
authors
of
articles
occasionally
say
that
readers
should
reply
by
mail
and
they
summarize
accordingly
readers
should
do
just
that
via
mail
responding
with
a
followup
article
to
such
an
article
defeats
the
intention
of
the
author
she
in
a
few
days
will
post
one
article
containing
the
highlights
of
the
responses
she
received
by
following
up
to
the
whole
group
the
author
may
not
read
what
you
have
to
say
when
creating
a
summary
of
the
replies
to
a
post
try
to
make
it
as
as
possible
avoid
just
putting
all
of
the
messages
received
into
one
big
file
rather
take
some
time
and
edit
the
messages
into
a
form
that
contains
the
essential
information
that
other
readers
would
be
interested
in
also
sometimes
people
will
respond
but
request
to
remain
anonymous
one
example
is
the
employees
of
a
corporation
that
feel
the
information
not
proprietary
but
at
the
same
time
want
to
protect
themselves
from
political
backlash
summaries
should
honor
this
request
accordingly
by
listing
the
from
address
as
anonymous
or
address
withheld
by
request
quoting
when
following
up
to
an
article
many
newsreaders
provide
the
facility
to

posts
the

to

it
usually
safe
to
crosspost
to
up
to
three
or
four
groups
to
list
more
than
that
is
considered
excessive
noise
it
also
suggested
that
if
an

is
crossposted
a

be
included
it
should
name
the

to

all
additional

a

followup
command
should
go
to
the

posting
the

no

there
also
a
mechanism
worked
in

certain

will
use
this

sense
that

never

is
often
used
with
questions
that
will
yield

will

or
read

the

paper
by
the
time
the

has
propagated
across
all
of
usenet
the
news
value
of
the

will
have
become
stale
this
is
one
case
for
the
argument
that
usenet

is
a
misnomer
note
that
the

al
quality

how
you
write
and
present
yourself
in
your
articles
is
important
if
you
have
terrible
spelling
keep
a
dictionary
near
by
if
you
have
trouble
with
grammar
and
punctuation
try
to
get
a
book
on
english
grammar
and
composition
found
in
many
bookstores
and
at
garage
sales
by
all
means
pay
attention
to
what
you
say
makes
you
who
you
are
on
the
net
likewise
try
to
be
clear
in
what
you
ask
ambiguous
or
vague
questions
often
lead
to
no
response
at
all
leaving
the
poster
discouraged
give
as
much
essential
information
as
you
feel
is
necessary
to
let
people
help
you
but
keep
it
within
limits
for
instance
you
should
probably
include
the
operating
system
of
your
computer
in
the
post
if
it
needed
but
do
tell
everybody
what
peripherals
you
have
hanging
off
of
it
useful
subjects
the
subject
line
of
an
article
is
what
will
first
attract
people
to
read
it
it
vague
or
does
describe
what
contained
within
no
one
will
read
the
article
at
the
same
time
subject
lines
that
too
wordy
tend
to
be
irritating
for
example
good

a

i
desperately
in
search
of
the
honorable
waldo
in
the
state
of
simply
put
try
to
think
of
what
will
best
help
the
reader
when
he
or
she
encounters
your
article
in
a
newsreading
session
tone
of
voice
since
common
computers
ca
portray
the
inflection
or
tone
in
a
person
voice
how
articles
are
worded
can
directly
affect
the
response
to
them
if
you
say
anybody
using
a
should
go
buy
themselves
a
life
you
definitely
get
some
responses
you
to
take
a
leap
rather
than
be
inflammatory
phrase
your
articles
in
a
way
that
rationally
expresses
your
opinion
like
what
the
practical
uses
of
a
these
days
which
presents
yourself
as
a
much
more
individual
also
what
case
upper
or
lower
you
use
can
indicate
how
trying
to
speak
dictates
that
if
you
use
all
capital
letters
people
will
think
you
shouting
write
as
you
would
in
a
normal
letter
to
a
friend
following
traditional
rules
of
english
or
whatever
language
you
happen
to
speak
computer
religion
no
matter
what
kind
of
computer
a
person
is
using
theirs
is
always
the
best
and
most
efficient
of
them
all
posting
articles
asking
questions
like
what
computer
should
i
buy
an
atari
st
or
an
amiga
will
lead
only
to
fervent
arguments
over
the
merits
and
drawbacks
of
each
brand
do
even
ask
the
net
to
a
local
user
group
or
do
some
research
of
your
own
like
reading
some
magazine
reviews
trying
to
say
one
computer
is
somehow
better
than
another
is
a
moot
point
the
anatomy
of
an
article
frequently
asked
questions
a
number
of
groups
include
frequently
asked
question
faq
lists
which
give
the
answers
to
questions
or
points
that
have
been
raised
time
and
time
again
in
a
newsgroup
they
intended
to
help
cut
down
on
the
redundant
traffic
in
a
group
for
example
in
the
newsgroup
one
recurring
question
is
did
you
notice
that
there
a
different
blackboard
opening
at
the
beginning
of
every
simpsons
episode
as
a
result
it
part
of
the
faq
for
that
group
usually
faq
lists
are
posted
at
the
beginning
of
each
month
and
are
set
to
expire
one
month
later
when
supposedly
the
next
faq
will
be
published
nearly
every
faq
is
also
crossposted
to
which
is
used
as
a
usenet
repository
for
them
the
archive
mit
with
jonathan
kamens
has
graciously
dedicated
a
machine
to
the
archiving
and
storage
of
the
various
periodic
postings
that
are
peppered
throughout
the
various
usenet
groups
to
access
them
ftp
to
the

be
it

telnet
telnet
is
the
main
internet
protocol
for
creating
a
connection
with
a
remote
machine
it
gives
the
user
the
opportunity
to
be
on
one
computer
system
and
do
work
on
another
which
may
be
across
the
street
or
thousands
of
miles
away
where
modems
are
limited
in
the
majority
by
the
quality
of
telephone
lines
and
a
single
connection
telnet
provides
a
connection
that
and
nearly
always
faster
than
the
latest
conventional
modems
using
telnet
as
with
ftp
anonymous
ftp
the
actual
command
for
negotiating
a
telnet
connection
varies
from
system
to
system
the
most
common
is
telnet
itself
though
it
takes
the
form
of
telnet
to
be
safe
we
use
your
local
system
as
a
working
example
by
now
you
hopefully
know
your
site
domain
name
if
not
ask
or
try
to
figure
it
out
you
not
get
by
without
it
to
open
the
connection
type
telnet
if
the
system
were
for
example
the
command
would
look
like
telnet
the
system
will
respond
with
something
similar
to
trying
connected
to
escape
character
is
the
escape
character
in
this
example
is
the
character
that
will
let
you
go
back
to
the
local
system
to
close
the
connection
suspend
it
etc
to
close
this
connection
the
user
would
type
and
respond
to
the
telnet
prompt
with
the
command
close
local
documentation
should
be
checked
for
information
on
specific
commands
functions
and
escape
character
that
can
be
used
telnet
ports
many
telnet
clients
also
include
a
third
option
the
port
on
which
the
connection
should
take
place
normally
port
is
the
default
telnet
port
the
user
never
has
to
think
about
it
but
sometimes
it
desirable
to
telnet
to
a
different
port
on
a
system
where
there
may
be
a
service
available
or
to
aid
in
debugging
a
problem
using
telnet
port
will
connect
the
user
to
the
given
port
on
the
system
many
libraries
use
this
port
method
to
offer
their
facilities
to
the
general
internet
community
other
services
are
also
available
for
instance
one
would
type
telnet
to
connect
to
the
geographic

the

of
michigan
geographic

other
such
port

publicly

over
the
last
several
years
most
university

have
switched

system
to
computerized

the
automated
systems
provide
users
with
easily
accessible

information
about
the

available

this
has
been
further
improved
upon
with

there
are
undoubtedly
others
and
new

spring
up
all
the

an
active
user
of
the

will
discover
most
of
the
more
common
ones
in

usually
these
services
are
free
commercial
services
for
applications
that
are

finger
on

there
exists
the
finger
command
which
yield
information
about
each
user
that
currently
logged
in
this
command
also
has
extensions
for
use
over
the
internet
as
well
under
normal
circumstances
the
command
is
simply
finger
for
a
summary
of
logged
into
the
local
system
or
finger
username
for
specific
information
about
a
user
it
also
possible
to
go
one
step
further
and
go
onto
the
network
the
general
usage
is
finger

to

please
realize
that
some
sites
are
very
security
conscious
and
need
to
restrict
the
information
about
their

and

available
to
the
outside

to
that
end
they
often
block

ping
the
ping
command
allows
the
user
to
check
if
another
system
is
currently
up
and
running
the
general
form
of
the
command
is
ping
system
the
usage
will
again
vary
for
example
ping
will
tell
you
if
the
main
machine
in
widener
university
computer
science
lab
is
currently
online
we
certainly
hope
so
many
implementations
of
ping
also
include
an
option
to
let
you
see
how
fast
a
link
is
running
to
give
you
some
idea
of
the
load
on
the

us
that
for
it
takes
about
milliseconds
for
a
packet
to
go
from
widener
to
swarthmore
college
and
back
again
it
also
gives
the
average
and
speeds
and
any
packet
loss
that
may
have
occurred
because
of
network
congestion
while
ping
generally
does
hurt
network
performance
you
should
use
it
too
often
once
or
twice

leave
you
relatively
sure
of
the
other

state
talk
sometimes
email
is
clumsy
and
difficult
to
manage
when
one
really
needs
to
have
an
interactive
conversation
the
internet
provides
for
that
as
well
in
the
form
of
talk
two
users
can
literally
see
each
other
type
across
thousands
of
miles
to
talk
with
bart
simpson
at
widener
one
would
type
talk
bart
which
would
cause
a
message
similar
to
the
following
to
be
displayed
on
bart
terminal
message
from
at
talk
connection
requested
by
joe
talk
respond
with
talk
joe
bart
would
presumably
respond
by
typing
talk
joe
they
could
then
chat
about
whatever
they
wished
with
instantaneous
response
time
rather
than
the
style
of
email
to
leave
talk
on
many
systems
one
would
type
hold
down
the
control
key
and
press
c
check
local
documentation
to
be
sure
there
are
two
different
versions
of
talk
in
common
use
today
the
first
dubbed
old
talk
is
supported
by
a
set
of
unix
systems
most
notably
those
currently
sold
by
sun
the
second
ntalk
aka
new
talk
is
more
of
the
standard
if
when
attempting
to
talk
with
another
user
it
responds
with
an
error
about
protocol
families
odds
are
the
incompatibilities
between
versions
of
talk
is
the
culprit

up
to
the
system
administrators
of
sites
which
use
the
old

you

that
you
hear
about
shortly
after

using

most

familiar
with

and
they
require
no
additional
explanation

only
that
were
true
this
section
addresses
a
few
topics
that
are
commonly
encountered
and
asked
about
as
a
new
user
explores
cyberspace
some
of
them
are
directly
related
to
how
the
networks
are
run
today
other
points
are
simply
interesting
to
read
about
the
internet
worm
from
a
letter
by
severo
ornstein
in
acm
june
and
the
appeal
notice
on
november
robert
morris
a
graduate
student
in
computer
science
at
cornell
wrote
an
experimental
program
called
a
worm
and
injected
it
into
the
internet
he
chose
to
release
it
from
mit
to
disguise
the
fact
that
the
worm
came
from
cornell
morris
soon
discovered
that
the
program
was
replicating
and
reinfecting
machines
at
a
much
faster
rate
than
he
had
anticipated
was
a
bug
ultimately
many
machines
at
locations
around
the
country
either
crashed
or
became
catatonic
when
morris
realized
what
was
happening
he
contacted
a
friend
at
harvard
to
discuss
a
solution
eventually
they
sent
an
anonymous
message
from
harvard
over
the
network
instructing
programmers
how
to
kill
the
worm
and
prevent
reinfection
however
because
the
network
route
was
clogged
this
message
did
not
get
through
until
it
was
too
late
computers
were
affected
at
many
sites
including
universities
military
sites
and
medical
research
facilities
the
estimated
cost
of
dealing
with
the
worm
at
each
installation
ranged
from
to
more
than
derived
in
part
from
a
letter
by
severo
ornstein
in
the
communications
of
the
acm
vol
no
june
the
program
took
advantage
of
a

the
word
free
in

not
refer

it
refers
to
freedom

it
to

that
they
can
use

the

works
to
provide

by
developing

replacements
for

specifically
they
are
putting

is
written

the

gnu
is
itself
recursive
the
mainstay
of
the
lisp

it
stands
for
gnu
not
unix
when
it
is

everyone
will
be
permitted
to
copy
it

are

directional
rfcs
were
discussed
and
agreed
to
but
their
application
has
never
come
into
wide
use
this
may
be
due
to
the
lack
of
wide
need
for
the
specific
application
the
post
office
protocol
or
that
although
technically
superior
ran
against
other
pervasive
approaches
hello
it
is
suggested
that
should
the
facility
be
required
by
a
particular
site
an
implementation
be
done
in
accordance
with
the
rfc
this
ensures
that
should
the
idea
be
one
whose
time
has
come
the
implementation
will
be
in
accordance
with
some
standard
and
will
be
generally
usable
informational
rfcs
contain
factual
information
about
the
internet
and
its
operation
assigned
numbers
there
is
also
a
subset
of
rfcs
called
fyis
for
your
information
they
are
written
in
a
language
much
more
informal
than
that
used
in
the
other
standard
rfcs
topics
range
from
answers
to
common
questions
for
new
and
experienced
users
to
a
suggested
bibliography
finally
as
the
internet
has
grown
and
technology
has
changed
some
rfcs
become
unnecessary
these
obsolete
rfcs
can
not
be
ignored
however
frequently
when
a
change
is
made
to
some
rfc
that
causes
a
new
one
to
obsolete
others
the
new
rfc
only
contains
explanations
and
motivations
for
the
change
understanding
the
model
on
which
the
whole
facility
is
based
may
involve
reading
the
original
and
subsequent
rfcs
on
the
topic
rfcs
and
fyis
are
available
via

getting

has
been
and
always
will
be
one
of
the
biggest
goals
in
computer

the
ultimate
desire
is
to
make
it
so
one

there
do
exist
a
few
alternatives
to
get
those

you
so
desperately
need
when
requesting
files
it
imperative
that
you
keep
in
mind
the
size
of
your

are
the
other

who
may

your

too
receptive
to
sudden
bursts
of
really
heavy
traffic
on

normally
sedate
connection
archive
servers
an
alternative
to
the
currently
well
ftpmail
system
is
taking
advantage
of
the
many
archive
servers
that
are
presently
being
maintained
these
are
programs
that
receive
email
messages
that
contain
commands
and
act
on
them
for
example
sending
an
archive
server
the
command
help
will
usually
yield
in
the
form
of
a
piece
of
email
information
on
how
to
use
the
various

that
the

servers
some
systems
offer
people
the
ability
to
receive
files
through
a
interface
via
email
anonymous
ftp
for
a
general
overview
of
how
to
ftp
the
effects
of
providing
such
a
service
varies
although
a
rule
of
thumb
is
that
it
will
probably
use
a
substantial
amount
of
the
available
resources
on
a
system
the
original
service
bitftp
is
available
to
bitnet
users
from
the
princeton
node
pucc
it
was
once
accessible
to
anyone
but
had
to
be
closed
out
to
users
because
of
the
heavy
load
on
the
system
in
response
to
this
closure
paul
vixie
designed
and
installed
a
system
called
ftpmail
on
one
of
digital
gateway
computers
write
to
ftpmail
with
help
in
the
body
of
the
letter
for
instructions
on
its
use
the
software
is
undergoing
constant
development
once
it
reaches
a
stable
state
other
sites
will
be
encouraged
to
adopt
it
and
provide
the
service
also
newsgroup
creation
everyone
has
the
opportunity
to
make
a
call
for
votes
on
the
usenet
and
attempt
to
create
a
newsgroup
that
feels
would
be
of
benefit
to
the
general
readership
the
rules
governing
newsgroup
creation
have
evolved
over
the
years
into
a
generally
accepted
method
they
only
govern
the
world
groups
they
are
applicable
to
regional
or
other
alternative
hierarchies
discussion
a
discussion
must
first
take
place
to
address
issues
like
the
naming
of
the
group
where
in
the
group
tree
it
should
go
vs
and
whether
or
not
it
should
be
created
in
the
first
place
the
formal
request
for
discussion
rfd
should
be
posted
to
along
with
any
other
groups
or
mailing
lists
at
all
related
to
the
proposed
topic
is
moderated
you
should
place
it
first
in
the
newsgroups
header
so
that
it
will
get
mailed
to
the
moderator
only
the
article
wo
be
immediately
posted
to
the
other
newsgroups
listed
rather
it
will
give
you
the
opportunity
to
have
the
moderator
correct
any
inconsistencies
or
mistakes
in
your
rfd
he
or
she
will
take
care
of
posting
it
to
the
newsgroups
you
indicated
also
the
header
will
be
set
so
that
the
actual
discussion
takes
place
only
in
if
a
user
has
difficulty
posting
to
a
moderated
group
he
or
she
may
mail
submissions
intended
for
to
the
address
the
final
name
and
charter
of
the
group
and
whether
it
will
be
moderated
or
unmoderated
will
be
determined
during
the
discussion
period
if
it
to
be
moderated
the
discussion
will
also
decide
who
the
moderator
will
be
if
there
no
general
agreement
on
these
points
among
those
in
favor
of
a
new
group
at
the
end
of
days
the
discussion
will
be
taken
into
mail
rather
than
continued
posting
to
that
way
the
proponents
of
the
group
can
iron
out
their
differences
and
come
back
with
a
proper
proposal
and
make
a
new
request
for
discussion
voting
after
the
discussion
period
which
is
mandatory
if
it
been
determined
that
a
new
group
really
is
desired
a
name
and
charter
are
agreed
upon
and
it
been
determined
whether
the
group
will
be
moderated
and
by
whom
a
call
for
votes
cfv
should
be
posted
to
along
with
any
other
groups
that
the
original
request
for
discussion
was
posted
to
the
cfv
should
be
posted
or
mailed
to
the
moderator
as
soon
as
possible
after
the
discussion
ends
to
keep
it
fresh
in
everyone
mind
the
call
for
votes
should
include
clear
instructions
on
how
to
cast
a
vote
it
important
that
it
be
clearly
explained
how
to
both
vote
for
and
against
a
group
and
be
of
equivalent
difficulty
or
ease
if
it
easier
for
you
or
your
administrator
two
separate
addresses
can
be
used
to
mail
yes
and
no
votes
to
providing
that
they
on
the
same
machine
regardless
of
the
method
everyone
must
have
a
very
specific
idea
of
how
to
get
vote
counted
the
voting
period
can
last
between
and
days
no
matter
what
the
preliminary
results
of
the
vote
are
a
vote
ca
be
called
off
simply
because
no
votes
have
come
in
and
only
two
yes
votes
the
call
for
votes
should
include
the
exact
date
that
the
voting
period
will
end
those
votes
arriving
on
the
machine
before
this
date
can
be
counted
to
keep
awareness
high
the
cfv
can
be
repeated
during
the
vote
provided
that
it
gives
the
same
clear
unbiased
instructions
for
casting
a
vote
as
the
original
it
also
has
to
be
the
same
proposal
as
was
first
posted
the
charter
ca
change
in
also
votes
that
posted
do
count
those
that
were
mailed
to
the
can
be
tallied
partial
results
should
never
be
included
only
a
statement
of
the
specific
proposal
that
a
vote
is
in
progress
on
it
and
how
to
cast
a
vote
a
mass
acknowledgement
mass
ack
or
vote
ack
is
permitted
however
it
must
be
presented
in
a
way
that
gives
no
indication
of
which
way
a
person
voted
one
way
to
avoid
this
is
to
create
one
large
list
of
everyone
who
voted
and
sort
it
in
alphabetical
order
it
should
not
be
two
sorted
lists
of
the
yes
and
no
votes
respectively
every
vote
is
autonomous
the
votes
for
or
against
one
group
ca
be
transferred
to
another
similar
proposal
a
vote
can
only
count
for
the
exact
proposal
that
it
was
a
response
to
in
particular
a
vote
for
or
against
a
newsgroup
under
one
name
ca
be
counted
as
a
vote
for
or
against
another
group
with
a
different
name
or
charter
a
different
status
or
if
it
moderated
a
different
moderator
or
set
of
moderators
whew
finally
the
vote
has
to
be
explicit
they
should
be
of
the
form
i
vote
for
the
group
as
proposed
or
i
vote
against
the
group
as
proposed
the
wording
does
have
to
be
exact
your
intention
just
has
to
be
clear
the
result
of
a
vote
at
the
end
of
the
voting
period
the
has
to
post
to
the
tally
and
email
addresses
of
the
votes
received
again
it
can
also
be
posted
to
any
of
the
groups
listed
in
the
original
cfv
the
tally
should
make
clear
which
way
a
person
voted
so
the
results
can
be
verified
if
it
proves
necessary
to
do
so
after
the
vote
result
is
posted
to
there
is
a
mandatory
waiting
period
this
affords
everyone
the
opportunity
to
correct
any
errors
or
inconsistencies
in
the
voter
list
or
the
voting
procedure
creation
of
the
group
if
after
the
waiting
period
there
are
no
serious
objections
that
might
invalidate
the
vote
the
vote
is
put
to
the
water
test
if
there
were
more
valid
votes
than
create
votes
and
at
least
of
the
total
number
of
votes
are
in
favor
of
creation
then
a
newgroup
control
message
can
be
sent
out
often
by
the
moderator
of
if
the
margin
or
the
percentage
is
met
the
group
has
failed
and
ca
be
created
if
the
proposal
failed
all
is
not
lost
a
waiting
period
a
cooling
down
a
new
request
for
discussion
can
be
posted
to
and
the
whole
process
can
start
over
again
if
after
a
couple
of
tries
it
becomes
obvious
that
the
group
is
not
wanted
or
needed
the
should
humbly
step
back
and
