this
is
the
story
of
odysseus
the
most
renowned
of
all
the
heroes
the
greek
poets
have
told
us
of
of
odysseus
his
wars
and
his
wanderings
and
this
story
of
odysseus
begins
with
his
son
the
youth
who
was
called
telemachus
it
was
when
telemachus
was
a
child
of
a
month
old
that
a
messenger
came
from
agamemnon
the
great
king
bidding
odysseus
betake
himself
to
the
war
against
troy
that
the
kings
and
princes
of
greece
were
about
to
wage
the
wise
odysseus
foreseeing
the
disasters
that
would
befall
all
that
entered
that
war
was
loth
to
go
and
so
when
agamemnon
messenger
came
to
the
island
of
ithaka
where
he
was
king
odysseus
pretended
to
be
mad
and
that
the
messenger
palamedes
might
believe
he
was
mad
indeed
he
did
a
thing
that
no
man
ever
saw
being
done
before
he
took
an
ass
and
an
ox
and
yoked
them
together
to
the
same
plough
and
began
to
plough
a
field
and
when
he
had
ploughed
a
furrow
he
sowed
it
not
with
seeds
that
would
grow
but
with
salt
when
palamedes
saw
him
doing
this
he
was
nearly
persuaded
that
odysseus
was
mad
but
to
test
him
he
took
the
child
telemachus
and
laid
him
down
in
the
field
in
the
way
of
the
plough
odysseus
when
he
came
near
to
where
the
child
lay
turned
the
plough
aside
and
thereby
showed
that
he
was
not
a
mad
man
then
had
he
to
take
king
agamemnon
summons
and
agamemnon
word
was
that
odysseus
should
go
to
aulis
where
the
ships
of
the
kings
and
princes
of
greece
were
being
gathered
but
first
he
was
to
go
into
another
country
to
seek
the
hero
achilles
and
persuade
him
also
to
enter
the
war
against
troy
and
so
odysseus
bade
to
his
infant
son
telemachus
and
to
his
young
wife
penelope
and
to
his
father
old
laertes
and
he
bade
to
his
house
and
his
lands
and
to
the
island
of
ithaka
where
he
was
king
he
summoned
a
council
of
the
chief
men
of
ithaka
and
commended
to
their
care
his
wife
and
his
child
and
all
his
household
and
thereafter
he
took
his
sailors
and
his
fighting
men
with
him
and
he
sailed
away
the
years
went
by
and
odysseus
did
not
return
after
ten
years
the
city
was
taken
by
the
kings
and
princes
of
greece
and
the
thread
of
war
was
wound
up
but
still
odysseus
did
not
return
and
now
minstrels
came
to
ithaka
with
word
of
the
deaths
or
the
homecomings
of
the
heroes
who
had
fought
in
the
war
against
troy
but
no
minstrel
brought
any
word
of
odysseus
of
his
death
or
of
his
appearance
in
any
land
known
to
men
ten
years
more
went
by
and
now
that
infant
son
whom
he
had
left
behind
telemachus
had
grown
up
and
was
a
young
man
of
strength
and
purpose
illustration
ii
one
day
as
he
sat
sad
and
disconsolate
in
the
house
of
his
father
the
youth
telemachus
saw
a
stranger
come
to
the
outer
gate
there
were
many
in
the
court
outside
but
no
one
went
to
receive
the
newcomer
then
because
he
would
never
let
a
stranger
stand
at
the
gate
without
hurrying
out
to
welcome
him
and
because
too
he
had
hopes
that
some
day
such
a
one
would
bring
him
tidings
of
his
father
telemachus
rose
up
from
where
he
was
sitting
and
went
down
the
hall
and
through
the
court
and
to
the
gate
at
which
the
stranger
stood
to
the
house
of
odysseus
said
telemachus
giving
him
his
hand
the
stranger
clasped
it
with
a
friendly
clasp
thank
you
telemachus
he
said
your
welcome
and
glad
i
am
to
enter
the
house
of
your
father
the
renowned
odysseus
the
stranger
looked
like
one
who
would
be
a
captain
amongst
soldiers
his
eyes
were
grey
and
clear
and
shone
wonderfully
in
his
hand
he
carried
a
great
bronze
spear
he
and
telemachus
went
together
through
the
court
and
into
the
hall
and
when
the
stranger
left
his
spear
within
the
spearstand
telemachus
took
him
to
a
high
chair
and
put
a
footstool
under
his
feet
he
had
brought
him
to
a
place
in
the
hall
where
the
crowd
would
not
come
there
were
many
in
the
court
outside
and
telemachus
would
not
have
his
guest
disturbed
by
questions
or
clamours
a
handmaid
brought
water
for
the
washing
of
his
hands
and
poured
it
over
them
from
a
golden
ewer
into
a
silver
basin
a
polished
table
was
left
at
his
side
then
the
brought
wheaten
bread
and
many
dainties
other
servants
set
down
dishes
of
meat
with
golden
cups
and
afterwards
the
maids
came
into
the
hall
and
filled
up
the
cups
with
wine
but
the
servants
who
waited
on
telemachus
and
his
guest
were
disturbed
by
the
crowd
of
men
who
now
came
into
the
hall
they
seated
themselves
at
tables
and
shouted
out
their
orders
great
dishes
of
meat
were
brought
to
them
and
bowls
of
wine
and
the
men
ate
and
drank
and
talked
loudly
to
each
other
and
did
not
refrain
even
from
staring
at
the
stranger
who
sat
with
telemachus
there
a
in
the
house
the
stranger
asked
do
the
men
of
your
clan
meet
here
to
drink
with
each
other
a
flush
of
shame
came
to
the
face
of
telemachus
is
no
here
he
said
do
the
men
of
our
clan
meet
here
to
drink
with
each
other
listen
to
me
my
guest
because
you
look
so
wise
and
because
you
seem
so
friendly
to
my
father
name
i
will
tell
you
who
these
men
are
and
why
they
trouble
this
house
thereupon
telemachus
told
the
stranger
how
his
father
had
not
returned
from
the
war
of
troy
although
it
was
now
ten
years
since
the
city
was
taken
by
those
with
whom
he
went
telemachus
said
must
have
died
on
his
way
back
to
us
and
i
must
think
that
his
bones
lie
under
some
nameless
strait
or
channel
of
the
ocean
would
he
had
died
in
the
fight
at
troy
then
the
kings
and
princes
would
have
made
him
a
worthy
of
his
name
and
his
deeds
his
memory
would
have
been
reverenced
amongst
men
and
i
his
son
would
have
a
name
and
would
not
be
imposed
upon
by
such
men
as
you
see
here
men
who
are
feasting
and
giving
orders
in
my
father
house
and
wasting
the
substance
that
he
gathered
come
they
to
be
here
asked
the
stranger
telemachus
told
him
about
this
also
when
seven
years
had
gone
by
from
the
fall
of
troy
and
still
odysseus
did
not
return
there
were
those
who
thought
he
was
dead
and
would
never
be
seen
more
in
the
land
of
ithaka
then
many
of
the
young
lords
of
the
land
wanted
penelope
telemachus
mother
to
marry
one
of
them
they
came
to
the
house
to
woo
her
for
marriage
but
she
mourning
for
the
absence
of
odysseus
and
ever
hoping
that
he
would
return
would
give
no
answer
to
them
for
three
years
now
they
were
coming
to
the
house
of
odysseus
to
woo
the
wife
whom
he
had
left
behind
him
want
to
put
my
between
two
dread
difficulties
said
telemachus
to
promise
to
wed
one
of
them
or
to
see
the
substance
of
our
house
wasted
by
them
here
they
come
and
eat
the
bread
of
our
fields
and
slay
the
beasts
of
our
flocks
and
herds
and
drink
the
wine
that
in
the
old
days
my
father
laid
up
and
weary
our
servants
with
their
orders
when
he
had
told
him
all
this
telemachus
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
the
stranger
my
guest
he
said
and
power
shine
out
of
your
eyes
speak
now
to
me
and
tell
me
what
i
should
do
to
save
the
house
of
odysseus
from
ruin
and
tell
me
too
if
you
think
it
possible
that
my
father
should
still
be
in
life
the
stranger
looked
at
him
with
his
grey
clear
eyes
thou
verily
the
son
of
odysseus
said
he
i
am
the
son
of
odysseus
said
telemachus
i
look
at
you
said
the
stranger
mark
your
head
and
eyes
and
i
know
they
are
such
a
head
and
such
eyes
as
odysseus
had
well
being
the
son
of
such
a
man
and
of
such
a
woman
as
the
lady
penelope
your
spirit
surely
shall
find
a
way
of
destroying
those
wooers
who
would
destroy
your
house
said
telemachus
gaze
and
your
speech
make
me
feel
equal
to
the
task
of
dealing
with
them
think
said
the
stranger
odysseus
your
father
has
not
perished
from
the
earth
he
may
yet
win
home
through
labors
and
perils
but
you
should
seek
for
tidings
of
him
harken
to
me
now
and
i
shall
tell
you
what
to
do
summon
a
council
of
all
the
chief
men
of
the
land
of
ithaka
and
stand
up
in
that
council
and
declare
that
the
time
has
come
for
the
wooers
who
waste
your
substance
to
scatter
each
man
to
his
own
home
and
after
the
council
has
been
held
i
would
have
you
voyage
to
find
out
tidings
of
your
father
whether
he
still
lives
and
where
he
might
be
go
to
pylos
first
to
the
home
of
nestor
that
old
king
who
was
with
your
father
in
the
war
of
troy
beg
nestor
to
give
you
whatever
tidings
he
has
of
odysseus
and
from
pylos
go
to
sparta
to
the
home
of
menelaus
and
helen
and
beg
tidings
of
your
father
from
them
too
and
if
you
get
news
of
his
being
alive
return
it
will
be
easy
for
you
then
to
endure
for
another
year
the
wasting
of
your
substance
by
those
wooers
but
if
you
learn
that
your
father
the
renowned
odysseus
is
indeed
dead
and
gone
then
come
back
and
in
your
own
country
raise
a
great
funeral
mound
to
his
memory
and
over
it
pay
all
funeral
rites
then
let
your
mother
choose
a
good
man
to
be
her
husband
and
let
her
marry
him
knowing
for
a
certainty
that
odysseus
will
never
come
back
to
his
own
house
after
that
something
will
remain
for
you
to
do
you
will
have
to
punish
those
wooers
who
destroy
the
goods
your
father
gathered
and
who
insult
his
house
by
their
presence
and
when
all
these
things
have
been
done
you
telemachus
will
be
free
to
seek
out
your
own
fortune
you
will
rise
to
fame
for
i
mark
that
you
are
handsome
and
strong
and
most
likely
to
be
a
wise
and
valiant
man
but
now
i
must
fare
on
my
journey
the
stranger
rose
up
from
where
he
sat
and
went
with
telemachus
from
the
hall
and
through
the
court
and
to
the
outer
gate
telemachus
said
you
have
told
me
i
shall
not
forget
i
know
you
have
spoken
out
of
a
wise
and
a
friendly
heart
and
as
a
father
to
his
son
the
stranger
clasped
his
hands
and
went
through
the
gate
and
then
as
he
looked
after
him
telemachus
saw
the
stranger
change
in
his
form
he
became
first
as
a
woman
tall
with
fair
hair
and
a
spear
of
bronze
in
her
hand
and
then
the
form
of
a
woman
changed
too
it
changed
into
a
great
that
on
wide
wings
rose
up
and
flew
high
through
the
air
telemachus
knew
then
that
his
visitor
was
an
immortal
and
no
other
than
the
goddess
athene
who
had
been
his
father
friend
iii
when
telemachus
went
back
to
the
hall
those
who
were
feasting
there
had
put
the
from
them
and
were
calling
out
for
phemius
the
minstrel
to
come
and
sing
some
tale
to
delight
them
and
as
he
went
amongst
them
one
of
the
wooers
said
to
another
guest
who
was
with
him
has
told
telemachus
something
that
has
changed
his
bearing
never
before
did
i
see
him
hold
himself
so
proudly
mayhap
he
has
spoken
to
him
of
the
return
of
his
father
the
renowned
odysseus
phemius
came
and
the
wooers
called
upon
him
to
sing
them
a
tale
and
the
minstrel
in
flowing
verse
began
the
tale
of
the
return
of
the
kings
and
princes
from
troy
and
of
how
some
god
or
goddess
put
a
trouble
upon
them
as
they
left
the
city
they
had
taken
and
as
the
minstrel
began
the
tale
penelope
telemachus
was
coming
down
the
stairs
with
two
beside
her
she
heard
the
words
he
sang
and
she
stood
still
in
her
grief
and
drew
her
veil
across
her
face
phemius
she
cried
from
that
story
that
ever
wastes
my
heart
the
story
that
has
brought
me
sorrow
and
that
leaves
me
comfortless
all
my
days
o
phemius
do
you
not
know
other
tales
of
men
and
gods
that
you
might
sing
in
this
hall
for
the
delight
of
my
noble
wooers
the
minstrel
would
have
ceased
when
penelope
spoke
thus
to
him
but
telemachus
went
to
the
stairway
where
his
stood
and
addressed
her
said
he
should
you
not
let
the
minstrel
delight
the
company
with
such
songs
as
the
spirit
moves
him
to
give
us
it
is
no
blame
to
him
if
he
sings
of
that
which
is
sorrowful
to
us
as
for
you
my
mother
you
must
learn
to
endure
that
story
for
long
will
it
be
sung
and
far
and
wide
and
you
are
not
the
only
one
who
is
bereaved
many
another
man
besides
odysseus
lost
the
happy
day
of
his
homecoming
in
the
war
of
troy
illustration
penelope
his
looked
in
surprise
at
the
youth
who
spoke
to
her
so
wisely
was
this
indeed
telemachus
who
before
had
hardly
lifted
his
head
and
as
she
looked
at
him
again
she
saw
that
he
carried
his
head
that
head
of
his
that
was
so
like
odysseus
high
and
proudly
she
saw
that
her
son
was
now
indeed
a
man
penelope
spoke
no
word
to
him
for
a
new
thought
had
come
into
her
mind
she
turned
round
on
the
stairs
and
went
back
with
her
to
the
chamber
where
her
loom
and
her
distaff
were
and
as
she
went
up
the
stairway
and
away
from
them
her
wooers
muttered
one
to
the
other
that
she
would
soon
have
to
choose
one
of
them
for
her
husband
telemachus
turned
to
those
who
were
standing
at
the
tables
and
addressed
them
of
my
mother
he
said
have
a
word
to
say
to
you
the
gods
youth
said
one
of
the
wooers
must
tell
us
first
who
he
is
who
has
made
you
so
high
and
proud
of
speech
said
another
who
has
done
that
is
the
stranger
who
was
with
him
who
is
he
why
did
he
come
here
and
of
what
land
has
he
declared
himself
to
be
did
he
not
stay
so
that
we
might
look
at
him
and
speak
to
him
said
another
of
the
wooers
are
the
words
i
would
say
to
you
let
us
feast
now
in
peace
without
any
brawling
amongst
us
and
listen
to
the
tale
that
the
minstrel
sings
to
us
said
telemachus
let
us
have
a
council
made
up
of
the
chief
men
of
this
land
of
ithaka
i
shall
go
to
the
council
and
speak
there
i
shall
ask
that
you
leave
this
house
of
mine
and
feast
on
goods
that
you
yourselves
have
gathered
let
the
chief
men
judge
whether
i
speak
in
fairness
to
you
or
not
if
you
do
not
heed
what
i
will
say
openly
at
the
council
before
all
the
chief
men
of
our
land
then
let
it
be
on
your
own
heads
what
will
befall
you
all
the
wooers
marvelled
that
telemachus
spoke
so
boldly
and
one
said
his
father
odysseus
was
king
this
youth
thinks
he
should
be
king
by
inheritance
but
may
zeus
the
god
never
grant
that
he
be
king
then
said
telemachus
the
god
zeus
should
grant
that
i
be
king
i
am
ready
to
take
up
the
kingship
of
the
land
of
ithaka
with
all
its
toils
and
all
its
dangers
and
when
telemachus
said
that
he
looked
like
a
young
king
indeed
but
they
sat
in
peace
and
listened
to
what
the
minstrel
sang
and
when
evening
came
the
wooers
left
the
hall
and
went
each
to
his
own
house
telemachus
rose
and
went
to
his
chamber
before
him
there
went
an
ancient
woman
who
had
nursed
him
as
a
child
eurycleia
was
her
name
she
carried
burning
torches
to
light
his
way
and
when
they
were
in
his
chamber
telemachus
took
off
his
soft
doublet
and
put
it
in
hands
and
she
smoothed
it
out
and
hung
it
on
the
pin
at
his
then
she
went
out
and
she
closed
the
door
behind
with
its
handle
of
silver
and
she
pulled
the
thong
that
bolted
the
door
on
the
other
side
and
all
night
long
telemachus
lay
wrapped
in
his
fleece
of
wool
and
thought
on
what
he
would
say
at
the
council
next
day
and
on
the
goddess
athene
and
what
she
had
put
into
his
heart
to
do
and
on
the
journey
that
was
before
him
to
nestor
in
pylos
and
to
menelaus
and
helen
in
sparta
iv
as
soon
as
it
was
dawn
telemachus
rose
from
his
bed
he
put
on
his
raiment
bound
his
sandals
on
his
feet
hung
his
sharp
sword
across
his
shoulder
and
took
in
his
hand
a
spear
of
bronze
then
he
went
forth
to
where
the
council
was
being
held
in
the
open
air
and
two
swift
hounds
went
beside
him
the
chief
men
of
the
land
of
ithaka
had
been
gathered
already
for
the
council
when
it
was
plain
that
all
were
there
the
man
who
was
oldest
amongst
them
the
lord
√¶gyptus
rose
up
and
spoke
he
had
sons
and
two
of
them
were
with
him
yet
tending
his
fields
but
one
eurynomous
by
name
kept
company
with
the
wooers
of
telemachus
mother
and
√¶gyptus
had
had
another
son
he
had
gone
in
odysseus
ship
to
the
war
of
troy
and
√¶gyptus
knew
he
had
perished
on
his
way
back
he
constantly
mourned
for
this
son
and
thinking
upon
him
as
he
spoke
√¶gyptus
had
tears
in
his
eyes
illustration
since
odysseus
summoned
us
together
before
he
took
ship
for
the
war
of
troy
have
we
met
in
council
said
he
have
we
been
brought
together
now
has
someone
heard
tidings
of
the
return
of
odysseus
if
it
be
so
may
the
god
zeus
give
luck
to
him
who
tells
us
of
such
good
fortune
telemachus
was
glad
because
of
the
kindly
speech
of
the
old
man
he
rose
up
to
speak
and
the
herald
put
a
staff
into
his
hands
as
a
sign
that
he
was
to
be
listened
to
with
reverence
telemachus
then
spoke
addressing
the
old
lord
√¶gyptus
will
tell
you
who
it
is
he
said
has
called
the
men
of
ithaka
together
in
council
and
for
what
purpose
revered
lord
√¶gyptus
i
have
called
you
together
but
not
because
i
have
had
tidings
of
the
return
of
my
father
the
renowned
odysseus
nor
because
i
would
speak
to
you
about
some
affair
of
our
country
no
i
would
speak
to
you
all
because
i
suffer
and
because
i
am
at
a
loss
i
whose
father
was
king
over
you
praised
by
you
all
odysseus
is
long
away
from
ithaka
and
i
deem
that
he
will
never
return
you
have
lost
your
king
but
you
can
put
another
king
to
rule
over
you
i
have
lost
my
father
and
i
can
have
no
other
father
in
all
my
days
and
that
is
not
all
my
loss
as
i
will
show
you
now
men
of
ithaka
three
years
now
my
mother
has
been
beset
by
men
who
come
to
woo
her
to
be
wife
for
one
of
them
day
after
day
they
come
to
our
house
and
kill
and
devour
our
beasts
and
waste
the
wine
that
was
laid
up
against
my
father
return
they
waste
our
goods
and
our
wealth
if
i
were
nearer
manhood
i
would
defend
my
house
against
them
but
as
yet
i
am
not
able
to
do
it
and
so
i
have
to
stand
by
and
see
our
house
and
substance
being
destroyed
so
telemachus
spoke
and
when
his
speech
was
ended
antinous
who
was
one
of
the
wooers
rose
up
said
he
do
you
try
to
put
us
to
shame
in
this
way
i
tell
all
here
that
it
is
not
we
but
your
mother
who
is
to
blame
we
knowing
her
husband
odysseus
is
no
longer
in
life
have
asked
her
to
become
the
wife
of
one
of
us
she
gives
us
no
honest
answer
instead
she
has
given
her
mind
to
a
device
to
keep
us
still
waiting
will
tell
you
of
the
council
what
this
device
is
the
lady
penelope
set
up
a
great
loom
in
her
house
and
began
to
weave
a
wide
web
of
cloth
to
each
of
us
she
sent
a
message
saying
that
when
the
web
she
was
working
at
was
woven
she
would
choose
a
husband
from
amongst
us
laertes
the
father
of
odysseus
is
alone
with
none
to
care
for
him
living
or
dead
said
she
to
us
i
must
weave
a
shroud
for
him
against
the
time
which
can
not
now
be
far
off
when
old
laertes
dies
trouble
me
not
while
i
do
this
for
if
he
should
die
and
there
be
no
to
wrap
him
round
all
the
women
of
the
land
would
blame
me
greatly
were
not
oppressive
and
we
left
the
lady
penelope
to
weave
the
web
and
the
months
have
gone
by
and
still
the
web
is
not
woven
but
even
now
we
have
heard
from
one
of
her
maids
how
penelope
tries
to
finish
her
task
what
she
weaves
in
the
daytime
she
unravels
at
night
never
then
can
the
web
be
finished
and
so
does
she
try
to
cheat
us
has
gained
praise
from
the
people
for
doing
this
how
wise
is
penelope
they
say
with
her
devices
let
her
be
satisfied
with
their
praise
then
and
leave
us
alone
we
too
have
our
devices
we
will
live
at
her
house
and
eat
and
drink
there
and
give
orders
to
her
servants
and
we
shall
see
which
will
satisfy
her
best
to
give
an
answer
or
to
let
the
wealth
of
her
house
be
wasted
for
you
telemachus
i
have
these
words
to
say
to
you
lead
your
mother
from
your
father
house
and
to
the
house
of
her
father
icarius
tell
icarius
to
give
her
in
marriage
to
the
one
she
chooses
from
amongst
us
do
this
and
no
more
goods
will
be
wasted
in
the
house
that
will
be
yours
then
telemachus
rose
and
said
will
i
lead
my
mother
out
of
a
house
that
my
father
brought
her
into
quit
my
father
house
or
as
i
tell
you
now
the
day
may
come
when
a
doom
will
fall
upon
you
there
for
your
insolence
in
it
and
even
as
telemachus
spoke
two
eagles
from
a
mountain
crest
flew
over
the
place
where
the
council
was
being
held
they
wheeled
above
and
flapped
their
wings
and
looked
down
upon
the
crowd
with
destruction
in
their
gaze
they
tore
each
other
with
their
talons
and
then
flew
away
across
the
city
an
old
man
who
was
there
halitherses
by
name
a
man
skilled
in
the
signs
made
by
birds
told
those
who
were
around
what
was
foreshown
by
the
combat
of
the
eagles
in
the
air
he
said
not
far
from
his
friends
he
will
return
and
his
return
will
mean
affliction
for
those
who
insult
his
house
now
let
them
make
an
end
of
their
mischief
but
the
wooers
only
laughed
at
the
old
man
telling
him
he
should
go
home
and
prophesy
to
his
children
then
arose
another
old
man
whose
name
was
mentor
and
he
was
one
who
had
been
a
friend
and
companion
of
odysseus
he
spoke
to
the
council
saying
again
need
a
king
be
gentle
in
his
heart
for
kind
and
gentle
to
you
all
was
your
king
odysseus
and
now
his
son
asks
you
for
help
and
you
do
not
hurry
to
give
it
him
it
is
not
so
much
an
affliction
to
me
that
these
wooers
waste
his
goods
as
that
you
do
not
rise
up
to
forbid
it
but
let
them
persist
in
doing
it
on
the
hazard
of
their
own
heads
for
a
doom
will
come
on
them
i
say
and
i
say
again
to
you
of
the
council
you
are
many
and
the
wooers
are
few
why
then
do
you
not
put
them
away
from
the
house
of
odysseus
but
no
one
in
the
council
took
the
side
of
telemachus
and
halitherses
and
mentor
so
powerful
were
the
wooers
and
so
fearful
of
them
were
the
men
of
the
council
the
wooers
looked
at
telemachus
and
his
friends
with
mockery
then
for
the
last
time
telemachus
rose
up
and
spoke
to
the
council
have
spoken
in
the
council
and
the
men
of
ithaka
know
and
the
gods
know
the
rights
and
wrongs
of
my
case
all
i
ask
of
you
now
is
that
you
give
me
a
swift
ship
with
twenty
youths
to
be
my
crew
so
that
i
may
go
to
pylos
and
to
sparta
to
seek
tidings
of
my
father
if
i
find
he
is
alive
and
that
he
is
returning
then
i
can
endure
to
wait
another
year
in
the
house
and
submit
to
what
you
do
there
even
at
this
speech
they
mocked
said
one
of
them
leocritus
by
name
odysseus
be
alive
and
should
one
day
come
into
his
own
hall
that
would
not
affright
us
he
is
one
and
we
are
many
and
if
he
should
strive
with
those
who
outnumber
him
why
then
let
his
doom
be
on
his
own
head
and
now
men
of
the
council
scatter
yourselves
and
go
each
to
his
own
home
and
let
mentor
and
halitherses
help
telemachus
to
get
a
ship
and
a
crew
leocritus
said
that
knowing
that
mentor
and
halitherses
were
old
and
had
few
friends
and
that
they
could
do
nothing
to
help
telemachus
to
get
a
ship
the
council
broke
up
and
those
who
were
in
it
scattered
but
the
wooers
went
together
back
to
the
house
of
odysseus
v
telemachus
went
apart
and
going
by
himself
came
to
the
shore
of
the
sea
he
dipped
his
hands
into
the
and
prayed
saying
goddess
athene
you
who
did
come
to
my
father
hall
yesterday
i
have
tried
to
do
as
you
bade
me
but
still
the
wooers
of
my
mother
hinder
me
from
taking
ship
to
seek
tidings
of
my
father
he
spoke
in
prayer
and
then
he
saw
one
who
had
the
likeness
of
the
old
man
mentor
coming
towards
him
but
by
the
grey
clear
eyes
he
knew
that
the
figure
was
none
other
than
the
goddess
athene
illustration
said
she
you
have
indeed
one
drop
of
your
blood
in
you
or
one
portion
of
his
spirit
if
you
are
as
he
was
one
ready
to
fulfil
both
word
and
work
your
voyage
shall
not
be
in
vain
if
you
are
different
from
what
he
was
i
have
no
hope
that
you
will
accomplish
your
desire
but
i
have
seen
in
you
something
of
the
wisdom
and
the
courage
of
odysseus
hear
my
counsel
then
and
do
as
i
direct
you
go
back
to
your
father
house
and
be
with
the
wooers
for
a
time
and
get
together
corn
and
and
wine
in
jars
and
while
you
are
doing
all
this
i
will
gather
together
a
crew
for
your
ship
there
are
many
ships
in
ithaka
and
i
shall
choose
the
best
for
you
and
we
will
rig
her
quickly
and
launch
her
on
the
wide
deep
when
telemachus
heard
her
counsel
he
tarried
no
more
but
went
back
to
the
house
and
stood
amongst
the
wooers
and
when
he
had
spoken
with
them
he
went
down
into
the
it
was
a
spacious
room
filled
with
gold
and
bronze
and
chests
of
raiment
and
casks
of
wine
the
doors
of
that
vault
were
closed
night
and
day
and
eurycleia
the
dame
who
had
been
the
nurse
of
telemachus
when
he
was
little
guarded
the
place
she
came
to
him
and
he
spoke
to
her
nurse
said
he
but
yourself
must
know
what
i
would
do
now
and
you
must
swear
not
to
speak
of
it
to
my
until
twelve
days
from
this
fill
twelve
jars
with
wine
for
me
now
and
pour
twelve
measures
of
into
skins
leave
them
all
together
for
me
and
when
my
mother
goes
into
the
upper
chamber
i
shall
have
them
carried
away
lo
nurse
i
go
to
pylos
and
to
sparta
to
seek
tidings
from
nestor
and
menelaus
of
odysseus
my
father
when
she
heard
him
say
this
the
nurse
eurycleia
lamented
wherefore
dear
child
she
cried
such
a
thought
risen
in
your
mind
how
could
you
fare
over
wide
seas
and
through
strange
lands
you
who
were
never
from
your
home
stay
here
where
you
are
well
beloved
as
for
your
father
he
has
long
since
perished
amongst
strangers
why
should
you
put
yourself
in
danger
to
find
out
that
he
is
no
more
nay
do
not
go
telemachus
my
fosterling
but
stay
in
your
own
house
and
in
your
own
country
telemachus
said
nurse
it
has
been
shown
to
me
that
i
should
go
by
a
goddess
is
not
that
enough
for
you
and
for
me
now
make
all
ready
for
me
as
i
have
asked
you
and
swear
to
me
that
you
will
say
nothing
of
it
to
my
mother
until
twelve
days
from
this
or
until
she
shall
miss
me
herself
having
sworn
as
he
asked
her
the
nurse
eurycleia
drew
the
wine
into
jars
and
put
the
into
the
skins
telemachus
left
the
vault
and
went
back
again
into
the
hall
he
sat
with
the
wooers
and
listened
to
the
minstrel
phemius
sing
about
the
going
forth
of
odysseus
to
the
wars
of
troy
and
while
these
things
were
happening
the
goddess
athene
went
through
the
town
in
the
likeness
of
telemachus
she
went
to
this
youth
and
that
youth
and
told
them
of
the
voyage
and
asked
them
to
make
ready
and
go
down
to
the
beach
where
the
boat
would
be
and
then
she
went
to
a
man
called
no√´mon
and
begged
him
for
a
swift
ship
and
no√´mon
gave
it
her
when
the
sun
sank
and
when
the
ways
were
darkened
athene
dragged
the
ship
to
where
it
should
be
launched
and
brought
the
tackling
to
it
the
youths
whom
athene
had
summoned
they
were
all
of
the
age
of
telemachus
came
and
athene
aroused
them
with
talk
of
the
voyage
and
when
the
ship
was
ready
she
went
to
the
house
of
odysseus
upon
the
wooers
who
were
still
in
the
hall
she
caused
sleep
to
fall
they
laid
their
heads
upon
the
tables
and
slumbered
beside
the
wine
cups
but
athene
sent
a
whisper
through
the
hall
and
telemachus
heard
and
he
rose
up
and
came
to
where
she
stood
now
she
had
on
the
likeness
of
old
mentor
the
friend
of
his
father
odysseus
said
she
friends
are
already
at
the
oars
we
must
not
delay
them
but
some
of
the
youths
had
come
with
the
one
whom
they
thought
was
old
mentor
they
carried
with
telemachus
the
skins
of
corn
and
the
casks
of
wine
they
came
to
the
ship
and
telemachus
with
a
cheer
climbed
into
it
then
the
youths
loosed
the
ropes
and
sat
down
at
the
benches
to
pull
the
oars
and
athene
in
the
likeness
of
old
mentor
sat
at
the
helm
and
now
they
set
up
the
mast
of
pine
and
they
made
it
fast
with
forestays
and
they
hauled
up
the
sails
with
ropes
of
twisted
oxhide
and
a
wind
came
and
filled
out
the
sails
and
the
youths
pulled
at
the
oars
and
the
ship
dashed
away
all
night
long
telemachus
and
his
friends
sat
at
the
oars
and
under
the
sails
and
felt
the
ship
bearing
them
swiftly
onward
through
the
dark
water
phemius
the
minstrel
was
with
them
and
as
the
night
went
by
he
sang
to
them
of
troy
and
of
the
heroes

were
so
strong

towers
and
great
gates
in
its
citadels
there
were
strong

well
armed
and
in
its
treasuries

now
but
he
had

all
was
hector
hector
the
minstrel
sang
was
a
match
for
any
warrior

send
against

because
he
was
noble
and
generous
as
well
as
brave

now
when
paris
was
in
his
infancy
a
soothsayer
told
king

would
bring

upon

had
the

of

but
no

at

wedding
would
judge
between

goddesses
and
say

and
then
the
shepherd
paris
came
by
and

the
guests
asked

to

the
apple
to

looked
on

and
in
his
eyes
she
was
the
fairest
to
her
he
gave
the
golden
apple
and
ever
afterwards
she
was
his
friend
but
hera
and
athene
departed
from
the
company
in
wrath
the
minstrel
sang
how
paris
went
back
to
his
father
city
and
was
made
a
prince
of
troy
through
the
favor
of
aphrodite
he
was
the
most
beautiful
of
youths
then
paris
went
out
of
the
city
again
sent
by
his
father
he
went
to
tyre
and
coming
back
to
troy
from
tyre
he
went
through
greece
now
the
fairest
woman
in
the
world
was
in
greece
she
was
helen
and
she
was
married
to
king
menelaus
paris
saw
her
and
loved
her
for
her
beauty
and
aphrodite
inspired
helen
to
fall
in
love
with
paris
he
stole
her
from
the
house
of
menelaus
and
brought
her
into
troy
king
menelaus
sent
to
troy
and
demanded
that
his
wife
be
given
back
to
him
but
the
people
of
troy
thinking
no
king
in
the
world
could
shake
them
and
wanting
to
boast
that
the
fairest
woman
in
the
world
was
in
their
city
were
not
willing
that
menelaus
be
given
back
his
wife
priam
and
his
son
hector
knew
that
a
wrong
had
been
done
and
knew
that
helen
and
all
that
she
had
brought
with
her
should
be
given
back
but
in
the
council
there
were
vain
men
who
went
against
the
word
of
priam
and
hector
declaring
that
for
no
little
king
of
greece
would
they
give
up
helen
the
fairest
woman
in
all
the
world
illustration
then
the
minstrel
sang
of
agamemnon
he
was
king
of
rich
mycen√¶
and
his
name
was
so
high
and
his
deeds
were
so
renowned
that
all
the
kings
of
greece
looked
to
him
now
agamemnon
seeing
menelaus
his
brother
flouted
by
the
trojans
vowed
to
injure
troy
and
he
spoke
to
the
kings
and
princes
of
greece
saying
that
if
they
all
united
their
strength
they
would
be
able
to
take
the
great
city
of
troy
and
avenge
the
slight
put
upon
menelaus
and
win
great
glory
and
riches
for
themselves
and
when
they
had
come
together
and
had
taken
note
of
their
strength
the
kings
and
princes
of
greece
thought
well
of
the
word
of
agamemnon
and
were
eager
to
make
war
upon
troy
they
bound
themselves
by
a
vow
to
take
the
city
then
agamemnon
sent
messages
to
the
heroes
whose
lands
were
far
away
to
odysseus
and
to
achilles
who
was
the
son
of
peleus
and
thetis
bidding
them
also
enter
the
war
in
two
years
the
ships
of
all
the
kings
and
princes
were
gathered
into
aulis
and
the
greeks
with
their
leaders
agamemnon
aias
diomedes
nestor
idomeneus
achilles
and
odysseus
sailed
for
the
coast
of
troy
one
hero
after
another
subdued
the
cities
and
nations
that
were
the
allies
of
the
trojans
but
troy
they
did
not
take
and
the
minstrel
sang
to
telemachus
and
his
how
year
after
year
went
by
and
how
the
host
of
greeks
still
remained
between
their
ships
and
the
walls
of
the
city
and
how
in
the
ninth
year
there
came
a
plague
that
smote
with
death
more
men
than
the
trojans
killed
so
the
ship
went
on
through
the
dark
water
very
swiftly
with
the
goddess
athene
in
the
likeness
of
old
mentor
guiding
it
and
with
the
youths
listening
to
the
song
that
phemius
the
minstrel
sang
vii
the
sun
rose
and
telemachus
and
his
drew
near
to
the
shore
of
pylos
and
to
the
steep
citadel
built
by
neleus
the
father
of
nestor
the
famous
king
they
saw
on
the
shore
men
in
companies
making
sacrifice
to
poseidon
the
god
of
the
sea
there
were
nine
companies
there
and
each
company
had
nine
black
oxen
for
the
sacrifice
and
the
number
of
men
in
each
company
was
five
hundred
they
slew
the
oxen
and
they
laid
parts
to
burn
on
the
altars
of
the
god
and
the
men
sat
down
to
feast
the
voyagers
brought
their
ship
to
the
shore
and
telemachus
sprang
from
it
but
before
him
went
the
goddess
athene
in
the
likeness
of
the
old
man
mentor
and
the
goddess
told
telemachus
that
nestor
the
king
whom
he
had
come
to
seek
was
on
the
shore
she
bade
him
now
go
forward
with
a
good
heart
and
ask
nestor
for
tidings
of
his
father
odysseus
but
telemachus
said
to
her
how
can
i
bring
myself
to
speak
to
one
who
is
so
reverenced
how
should
i
greet
him
and
how
can
i
a
young
man
question
such
a
one
as
nestor
the
old
king
illustration
the
goddess
athene
encouraged
him
the
right
words
she
said
would
come
so
telemachus
went
forward
with
his
divine
companion
nestor
was
seated
on
the
shore
with
his
sons
around
him
and
when
they
saw
the
two
strangers
approach
the
sons
of
nestor
rose
up
to
greet
them
one
peisistratus
took
the
hand
of
telemachus
and
the
hand
of
the
goddess
and
led
them
both
to
where
nestor
was
a
golden
cup
was
put
into
the
hand
of
each
and
wine
was
poured
into
the
cups
and
nestor
son
peisistratus
asked
telemachus
and
the
goddess
to
pray
that
the
sacrifice
they
were
making
to
poseidon
the
god
of
the
sea
would
bring
good
to
them
and
to
their
people
then
the
goddess
athene
in
the
likeness
of
old
mentor
held
the
cup
in
her
hand
and
prayed
me
poseidon
shaker
of
the
earth
first
to
nestor
and
his
sons
grant
renown
then
grant
to
the
people
of
pylos
recompense
for
the
sacrifice
of
oxen
they
have
made
grant
too
that
telemachus
and
i
may
return
safely
when
what
we
have
come
in
our
swift
ship
to
seek
has
been
won
telemachus
prayed
in
the
words
of
the
goddess
and
then
the
sons
of
nestor
made
them
both
sit
on
the
fleeces
that
were
spread
on
the
shore
and
dishes
of
meat
were
brought
to
them
and
cups
of
wine
and
when
they
had
eaten
and
drunk
the
old
king
nestor
spoke
to
them
they
have
partaken
of
food
and
drink
it
is
not
courteous
he
said
ask
of
strangers
who
they
are
and
whither
they
go
but
now
my
guests
i
will
ask
of
you
what
your
land
is
and
what
your
quest
and
what
names
you
bear
then
telemachus
said
renowned
king
glory
of
the
greeks
we
have
come
out
of
ithaka
and
we
seek
tidings
of
my
father
of
odysseus
who
long
ago
fought
by
your
side
in
the
war
of
troy
with
you
men
say
he
sacked
the
great
city
of
the
trojans
but
no
further
story
about
him
has
been
told
and
i
have
come
to
your
knees
o
king
to
beg
you
to
give
me
tidings
of
him
whether
he
died
and
you
saw
his
death
or
whether
you
heard
of
his
death
from
another
and
if
you
should
answer
me
speak
not
i
pray
you
in
pity
for
me
but
tell
me
all
you
know
or
have
heard
ah
if
ever
my
father
helped
you
in
the
land
of
the
trojans
by
the
memory
of
what
help
he
gave
i
pray
you
speak
in
truth
to
me
his
son
then
said
nestor
the
old
king
my
son
you
bring
sorrow
to
my
mind
ah
where
are
they
who
were
with
me
in
our
war
against
the
mighty
city
of
troy
where
is
aias
and
achilles
and
patroklos
and
my
own
dear
son
antilochos
who
was
so
noble
and
so
strong
and
where
is
agamemnon
now
he
returned
to
his
own
land
to
be
killed
in
his
own
hall
by
a
most
treacherous
foeman
and
now
you
ask
me
of
odysseus
the
man
who
was
dearer
to
me
than
any
of
the
others
odysseus
who
was
always
of
the
one
mind
with
me
never
did
we
two
speak
diversely
in
the
assembly
nor
in
the
council
say
to
me
that
you
are
the
son
of
odysseus
surely
you
are
amazement
comes
over
me
as
i
look
on
you
and
listen
to
you
for
you
look
as
he
looked
and
you
speak
as
he
spoke
but
i
would
have
you
speak
further
to
me
and
tell
me
of
your
homeland
and
of
how
things
fare
in
ithaka
then
he
told
the
old
king
of
the
evil
deeds
i
worked
by
the
wooers
of
his
mother
and
when
he
had
told
of
them
telemachus
cried
out
that
the
gods
would
give
me
such
strength
that
i
might
take
vengeance
on
them
for
their
many
transgressions
then
said
old
nestor
knows
but
odysseus
will
win
home
and
requite
the
violence
of
these
suitors
and
the
insults
they
have
offered
to
your
house
the
goddess
athene
might
bring
this
to
pass
well
was
she
inclined
to
your
father
and
never
did
the
gods
show
such
favour
to
a
mortal
as
the
goddess
showed
to
odysseus
your
father
but
telemachus
answered
no
wise
can
your
word
be
accomplished
king
then
athene
in
the
likeness
of
old
mentor
spoke
to
him
and
said
word
has
crossed
your
lips
telemachus
if
it
should
please
them
any
one
of
the
gods
could
bring
a
man
home
from
afar
only
this
the
gods
may
not
do
avert
death
from
a
man
who
has
been
doomed
to
it
telemachus
answered
her
and
said
no
longer
let
us
talk
of
these
things
nestor
the
renowned
king
has
been
very
gracious
to
me
but
he
has
nothing
to
tell
me
of
my
father
i
deem
now
that
odysseus
will
never
return
to
menelaus
said
nestor
to
menelaus
in
sparta
lately
he
has
come
from
a
far
and
a
strange
country
and
it
may
be
that
he
has
heard
of
odysseus
in
his
wanderings
you
can
go
to
sparta
in
your
ship
but
if
you
have
a
mind
to
fare
by
land
then
will
i
give
you
a
chariot
and
horses
and
my
son
will
go
with
you
to
be
a
guide
for
you
into
sparta
then
telemachus
with
athene
the
goddess
in
the
likeness
of
old
mentor
would
have
gone
back
to
their
ship
but
nestor
the
king
said
forbid
that
you
two
should
go
back
to
the
ship
to
take
your
rest
while
there
is
in
my
hall
come
with
me
to
a
place
where
you
can
lie
softly
never
shall
it
be
said
that
a
son
of
odysseus
my
dear
friend
lay
on
the
hard
deck
of
a
ship
while
i
am
alive
and
while
children
of
mine
are
left
in
my
hall
come
with
me
now
then
the
goddess
athene
in
the
likeness
of
old
mentor
said
have
spoken
as
becomes
you
renowned
king
telemachus
should
harken
to
your
word
and
go
with
you
but
it
is
meet
that
the
young
men
who
came
for
the
love
of
him
should
have
an
elder
with
them
on
the
ship
i
shall
abide
with
them
so
speaking
the
goddess
athene
in
the
likeness
of
old
mentor
went
from
the
shore
and
telemachus
went
with
nestor
and
his
sons
to
the
high
citadel
of
neleus
and
there
he
was
given
a
bath
and
the
maiden
polycaste
the
youngest
daughter
of
king
nestor
attended
him
she
gave
him
new
raiment
to
wear
a
goodly
mantle
and
doublet
he
slept
in
a
room
with
peisistratus
the
youngest
of
nestor
sons
in
the
morning
they
feasted
and
did
sacrifice
and
when
he
had
given
judgments
to
the
people
the
old
king
nestor
spoke
to
his
sons
now
my
sons
yoke
for
telemachus
the
horses
to
the
chariot
that
he
may
go
on
his
way
to
sparta
the
sons
of
nestor
gave
heed
and
they
yoked
the
swift
horses
to
the
chariot
and
the
housedame
came
from
the
hall
and
placed
within
the
chariot
wine
and
dainties
telemachus
went
into
the
chariot
and
peisistratus
sat
before
him
then
peisistratus
touched
the
horses
with
the
whip
and
they
sprang
forward
and
the
chariot
went
swiftly
over
the
plain
soon
they
left
behind
them
the
steep
citadel
of
neleus
and
the
land
of
pylos
and
when
the
sun
sank
and
the
ways
were
darkened
they
came
to
pher√¶
and
to
the
house
of
diocles
and
there
they
rested
for
the
night
in
the
morning
as
soon
as
the
sun
rose
they
yoked
the
houses
and
they
mounted
the
chariot
and
for
another
day
they
journeyed
across
the
plain
they
had
gone
far
and
the
ways
were
again
darkened
around
them
viii
they
came
to
sparta
to
a
country
lying
low
amongst
the
hills
and
they
stayed
the
chariot
outside
the
gate
of
the
king
dwelling
now
upon
that
day
menelaus
was
sending
his
daughter
into
phthia
with
horses
and
chariots
as
a
bride
for
achilles
son
and
for
megapenthes
his
own
son
a
bride
was
being
brought
into
the
house
because
of
these
two
marriages
there
was
feasting
in
the
palace
and
kinsmen
and
neighbours
were
gathered
there
a
minstrel
was
singing
to
the
guests
and
two
tumblers
were
whirling
round
the
high
hall
to
divert
them
illustration
to
the
king
in
his
high
hall
came
eteoneus
the
steward
menelaus
said
eteoneus
are
two
strangers
outside
men
with
the
looks
of
heroes
what
would
you
have
me
do
with
them
shall
i
have
their
horses
unyoked
bidding
them
enter
the
palace
or
shall
i
let
them
fare
on
to
another
dwelling
do
you
ask
such
a
question
eteoneus
said
menelaus
in
anger
we
not
eaten
the
bread
of
other
men
on
our
wanderings
and
have
we
not
rested
ourselves
in
other
men
houses
knowing
this
you
have
no
right
to
ask
whether
you
should
bid
strangers
enter
or
let
them
go
past
the
gate
of
my
dwelling
go
now
and
bid
them
enter
and
feast
with
us
then
eteoneus
went
from
the
hall
and
while
he
had
servants
unyoke
the
horses
from
their
chariot
he
led
telemachus
and
peisistratus
into
the
palace
first
they
were
brought
to
the
bath
and
when
they
had
come
from
the
bath
refreshed
they
were
given
new
cloaks
and
mantles
when
they
had
dressed
themselves
they
were
led
into
the
king
high
hall
they
seated
themselves
there
and
a
maid
brought
water
in
a
golden
ewer
and
poured
it
over
their
hands
into
a
silver
basin
then
a
polished
table
was
put
beside
them
and
the
housedame
placed
bread
and
meat
and
wine
upon
it
so
that
they
might
eat
menelaus
came
to
where
they
sat
and
said
to
telemachus
and
peisistratus
your
looks
i
know
you
to
be
of
the
line
of
kings
eat
now
and
when
you
have
refreshed
yourselves
i
will
ask
who
you
are
and
from
what
place
you
come
but
before
they
had
finished
their
meal
and
while
yet
menelaus
the
king
was
showing
them
the
treasures
that
were
near
the
lady
helen
came
into
the
high
hall
helen
for
whom
the
kings
and
princes
of
greece
had
gone
to
war
her
maids
were
with
her
and
they
set
a
chair
for
her
near
where
menelaus
was
and
they
put
a
rug
of
soft
wool
under
her
feet
then
one
brought
to
her
a
silver
basket
filled
with
colored
yarn
and
helen
sat
in
her
high
chair
and
took
the
distaff
in
her
hands
and
worked
the
yarn
she
questioned
menelaus
about
the
things
that
had
happened
during
the
day
and
as
she
did
she
watched
telemachus
then
the
lady
helen
left
the
distaff
down
and
said
i
am
minded
to
tell
you
who
one
of
these
strangers
is
no
one
was
ever
more
like
another
than
this
youth
is
like
odysseus
i
know
that
he
is
no
other
than
telemachus
whom
odysseus
left
as
a
child
when
for
my
sake
the
greeks
began
their
war
against
troy
then
said
menelaus
too
mark
his
likeness
to
odysseus
the
shape
of
his
head
the
glance
of
his
eye
remind
me
of
odysseus
but
can
it
indeed
be
that
telemachus
has
come
into
my
house
menelaus
said
peisistratus
is
indeed
the
son
of
odysseus
and
i
avow
myself
to
be
the
son
of
another
comrade
of
yours
of
nestor
who
was
with
you
at
the
war
of
troy
i
have
been
sent
with
telemachus
to
be
his
guide
to
your
house
menelaus
rose
up
and
clasped
the
hand
of
telemachus
did
there
come
to
my
house
said
he
youth
more
welcome
for
my
sake
did
odysseus
endure
much
toil
and
many
adventures
had
he
come
to
my
country
i
would
have
given
him
a
city
to
rule
over
and
i
think
that
nothing
would
have
parted
us
one
from
the
other
but
odysseus
i
know
has
not
returned
to
his
own
land
of
ithaka
then
telemachus
thinking
upon
his
father
dead
or
wandering
through
the
world
wept
helen
too
shed
tears
remembering
things
that
had
happened
and
menelaus
thinking
upon
odysseus
and
on
all
his
toils
was
silent
and
sad
and
sad
and
silent
too
was
peisistratus
thinking
upon
antilochos
his
brother
who
had
perished
in
the
war
of
troy
but
helen
wishing
to
turn
their
minds
to
other
thoughts
cast
into
the
wine
a
drug
that
lulled
pain
and
brought
forgetfulness
a
drug
which
had
been
given
to
her
in
egypt
by
polydamna
the
wife
of
king
theon
and
when
they
had
drunk
the
wine
their
sorrowful
memories
went
from
them
and
they
spoke
to
each
other
without
regretfulness
thereafter
king
menelaus
told
of
his
adventure
with
the
ancient
one
of
the
sea
the
adventure
that
had
brought
to
him
the
last
tidings
of
odysseus
ix
said
menelaus
against
the
river
that
flows
out
of
egypt
there
is
an
island
that
men
call
pharos
and
to
that
island
i
came
with
my
ships
when
we
the
heroes
who
had
fought
at
troy
were
separated
one
from
the
other
there
i
was
held
day
after
day
by
the
will
of
the
gods
our
provision
of
corn
was
spent
and
my
men
were
in
danger
of
perishing
of
hunger
then
one
day
while
my
companions
were
striving
desperately
to
get
fish
out
of
the
sea
i
met
on
the
shore
one
who
had
pity
for
our
plight
was
an
immortal
eidoth√´e
a
daughter
of
the
ancient
one
of
the
sea
i
craved
of
her
to
tell
me
how
we
might
get
away
from
that
place
and
she
counselled
me
to
take
by
an
ambush
her
father
the
ancient
one
of
the
sea
who
is
also
called
proteus
you
can
make
him
tell
you
said
she
for
he
knows
all
things
what
you
must
do
to
get
away
from
this
island
of
pharos
moreover
he
can
declare
to
you
what
happened
to
the
heroes
you
have
been
separated
from
and
what
has
taken
place
in
your
own
hall
said
i
to
that
kind
nymph
eidoth√´e
show
me
how
i
may
take
by
an
ambush
your
immortal
father
the
ancient
one
of
the
sea
eidoth√´e
my
father
proteus
comes
out
of
the
sea
when
the
sun
is
highest
in
the
heavens
then
would
he
lie
down
to
sleep
in
the
caves
that
are
along
the
shore
but
before
he
goes
to
sleep
he
counts
as
a
shepherd
counts
his
flock
the
seals
that
come
up
out
of
the
ocean
and
lie
round
where
he
lies
if
there
be
one
too
many
or
one
less
than
there
should
be
he
will
not
go
to
sleep
in
the
cave
but
i
will
show
you
how
you
and
certain
of
your
companions
may
be
near
without
the
ancient
one
of
the
sea
being
aware
of
your
presence
take
three
of
your
men
the
three
you
trust
above
all
the
others
and
as
soon
as
it
is
dawn
meet
me
by
the
edge
of
the
sea
saying
the
nymph
eidoth√´e
plunged
into
the
sea
and
i
went
from
that
place
anxious
but
with
hope
in
my
heart
as
soon
as
the
dawn
had
come
i
walked
by
the
and
with
me
came
the
three
that
i
trusted
above
all
my
companions
the
daughter
of
the
ancient
one
of
the
sea
eidoth√´e
came
to
us
in
her
arms
she
had
the
skins
of
seals
one
for
each
of
us
and
at
the
cave
where
the
seals
lay
she
scooped
holes
in
the
sand
and
bade
us
lie
there
covering
ourselves
with
the
skins
then
she
spoke
to
me
and
said
when
my
father
the
ancient
one
of
the
sea
comes
here
to
sleep
lay
hands
upon
him
and
hold
him
with
all
the
strength
you
have
he
will
change
himself
into
many
shapes
but
do
not
you
let
go
your
hold
upon
him
when
he
changes
back
into
the
shape
he
had
at
first
you
may
let
go
your
holds
question
him
then
as
to
how
you
may
leave
this
place
or
question
him
as
to
any
other
matter
that
may
be
on
your
mind
and
he
will
answer
you
speaking
the
truth
lay
down
in
the
holes
she
had
scooped
in
the
sand
and
she
covered
each
of
us
with
one
of
the
skins
she
had
brought
then
the
seals
came
out
of
the
sea
and
lay
all
around
us
the
smell
that
came
from
those
beasts
of
the
sea
afflicted
us
and
it
was
then
that
our
adventure
became
terrible
we
could
not
have
endured
it
if
eidoth√´e
had
not
helped
us
in
this
also
she
took
ambrosia
and
set
it
beneath
each
nostril
so
that
what
came
to
us
was
not
the
smell
of
the
but
a
divine
savour
then
the
nymph
went
back
to
the
sea
lay
there
with
steadfast
hearts
amongst
the
herd
of
seals
until
the
sun
was
at
its
highest
in
the
heavens
the
ancient
one
of
the
sea
came
out
of
the
ocean
depths
he
went
amongst
the
seals
and
counted
them
and
us
four
men
he
reckoned
amongst
his
herd
then
in
great
contentment
he
laid
himself
down
to
sleep
rushed
upon
him
with
a
cry
and
laid
hold
on
him
with
all
the
strength
of
our
hands
but
we
had
no
sooner
grasped
him
than
his
shape
changed
he
became
a
lion
and
faced
us
yet
we
did
not
let
go
of
our
grasp
he
became
a
serpent
yet
we
still
held
him
he
became
a
leopard
and
then
a
mighty
boar
he
became
a
stream
of
water
and
then
a
flowering
tree
yet
still
we
held
to
him
with
all
our
might
and
our
hearts
were
not
daunted
by
the
shapes
he
changed
to
before
our
eyes
then
seeing
that
he
could
not
make
us
loose
our
hold
the
ancient
one
of
the
sea
who
was
called
proteus
ceased
in
his
changes
and
became
as
we
had
seen
him
first
illustration
son
of
atreus
said
he
speaking
to
me
who
was
it
showed
you
how
to
lay
this
ambush
for
me
it
is
for
you
who
know
all
things
said
i
to
make
answer
to
us
tell
me
now
why
it
is
that
i
am
held
on
this
island
which
of
the
gods
holds
me
here
and
for
what
reason
the
ancient
one
of
the
sea
answered
me
speaking
truth
zeus
the
greatest
of
all
the
gods
holds
you
here
you
neglected
to
make
sacrifice
to
the
gods
and
for
that
reason
you
are
held
on
this
island
then
said
i
what
must
i
do
to
win
back
the
favor
of
the
gods
told
me
speaking
truth
before
setting
sail
for
your
own
land
he
said
you
must
return
to
the
river
√¶gyptus
that
flows
out
of
africa
and
offer
sacrifice
there
to
the
gods
he
said
this
my
spirit
was
broken
with
grief
a
long
and
a
grievous
way
would
i
have
to
sail
to
make
that
sacrifice
turning
back
from
my
own
land
yet
the
will
of
the
gods
would
have
to
be
done
again
i
was
moved
to
question
the
ancient
one
of
the
sea
and
to
ask
him
for
tidings
of
the
men
who
were
my
companions
in
the
wars
of
troy
son
of
odysseus
more
broken
than
ever
was
my
spirit
with
grief
when
he
told
me
of
their
fates
then
i
heard
how
my
brother
great
agamemnon
reached
his
own
land
and
was
glad
in
his
heart
but
his
wife
had
hatred
for
him
and
in
his
own
hall
she
and
√¶gisthus
had
him
slain
i
sat
and
wept
on
the
sands
but
still
i
questioned
the
ancient
one
of
the
sea
and
he
told
me
of
strong
aias
and
how
he
was
killed
by
the
falling
rock
after
he
had
boasted
that
poseidon
the
god
of
the
sea
could
afflict
him
no
more
and
of
your
father
the
renowned
odysseus
the
ancient
one
had
a
tale
to
tell
and
even
now
it
may
be
odysseus
was
on
an
island
away
from
all
mankind
there
he
abides
in
the
hall
of
the
nymph
calypso
the
ancient
one
of
the
sea
told
me
i
saw
him
shed
great
tears
because
he
could
not
go
from
that
place
but
he
has
no
ship
and
no
companions
and
the
nymph
calypso
holds
him
there
and
always
he
longs
to
return
to
his
own
country
to
the
land
of
ithaka
and
after
he
had
spoken
to
me
of
odysseus
he
went
from
us
and
plunged
into
the
sea
i
went
back
to
the
river
√¶gyptus
and
moored
my
ships
and
made
pious
sacrifice
to
the
gods
a
fair
wind
came
to
us
and
we
set
out
for
our
own
country
swiftly
we
came
to
it
and
now
you
see
me
the
happiest
of
all
those
who
set
out
to
wage
war
against
troy
and
now
dear
son
of
odysseus
you
know
what
an
immortal
told
of
your
father
how
he
is
still
in
life
but
how
he
is
held
from
returning
to
his
own
home
thus
from
menelaus
the
youth
telemachus
got
tiding
of
his
father
when
the
king
ceased
to
speak
they
went
from
the
hall
with
torches
in
their
hands
and
came
to
the
vestibule
where
helen
handmaids
had
prepared
beds
for
telemachus
and
peisistratus
and
as
he
lay
there
under
purple
blankets
and
soft
coverlets
the
son
of
odysseus
thought
upon
his
father
still
in
life
but
held
in
that
unknown
island
by
the
nymph
calypso
x
his
ship
and
his
waited
at
pylos
but
for
a
while
longer
telemachus
bided
in
sparta
for
he
would
fain
hear
from
menelaus
and
from
helen
the
tale
of
troy
many
days
he
stayed
and
on
the
first
day
menelaus
told
him
of
achilles
the
greatest
of
the
heroes
who
had
fought
against
troy
and
on
another
day
the
lady
helen
told
him
of
hector
the
noblest
of
all
the
men
who
defended
king
priam
city
said
king
menelaus
sprung
of
a
race
that
was
favoured
by
the
immortals
peleus
the
father
of
achilles
had
for
his
friend
cheiron
the
wisest
of
the
centaurs
of
those
immortals
who
are
half
men
and
half
horse
cheiron
it
was
who
gave
to
peleus
his
great
spear
and
when
peleus
desired
to
wed
an
immortal
zeus
the
greatest
of
the
gods
prevailed
upon
the
nymph

knowing
that
great
disasters
would
befall
those
who
went
to
that
war
feared
for
achilles
she
resolved
to
hide
him
so
that
no

might
reach
him
and
how
did
the
nymph
thetis
hide
her
son
she
sent
him
to

prayed
the
king
to
hide

searched
everywhere
for
him
many
of

came
to
the

but
not
finding
one
like
achilles
amongst
the
king
sons
they
went
away
by
agamemnon
order
came
to
seek
achilles
he
knew
that
the
youth
was
not
amongst
the
king
sons
he
saw
the
king
daughters
in
their
father
orchard
but
could
not
tell
if
achilles
was
amongst
them
for
all
were
veiled
and
dressed
alike

odysseus
went
away
and
returned
as
a
peddler
carrying
in
his
pack
such
things
as
maidens
admire
veils
and
ornaments
and
brazen
mirrors
but
under
the
veils
and
ornaments
and
mirrors
the
wise
odysseus
left
a
gleaming
sword
when
he
came
before
the
maidens
in
the
king
orchard
he
laid
down
his
peddler
pack
the
mirrors
and
veils
and
ornaments
were
taken
up
and
examined
eagerly
but
one
of
the
company
took
up
the
gleaming
sword
and
looked
at
it
with
flashing
eyes
odysseus
knew
that
this
was
achilles
king
peleus
son
gave
the
youth
the
summons
of
king
agamemnon
bidding
him
join
the
war
that
the
kings
and
princes
of
greece
were
about
to
wage
against
troy
and
achilles
was
glad
to
get
the
summons
and
glad
to
go
he
returned
to
phthia
to
his
father
citadel
there
did
he
make
ready
to
go
to
aulis
where
the
ships
were
being
gathered
he
took
with
him
his
father
famous
warriors
the
myrmidons
who
were
never
beaten
in
battle
and
his
father
bestowed
on
him
the
armour
and
the
horses
that
had
been
the
gift
of
zeus
the
two
immortal
horses
xanthos
and
balios
what
rejoiced
achilles
more
than
the
gift
of
marvellous
armour
and
immortal
steeds
was
that
his
dear
comrade
patroklos
was
to
be
with
him
as
his
mate
in
war
patroklos
had
come
into
phthia
and
into
the
hall
of
peleus
when
he
was
a
young
boy
in
his
own
country
he
had
killed
another
boy
by
mischance
over
a
game
of
dice
his
father
to
save
him
from
the
penalty
fled
with
him
to
king
peleus
and
achilles
father
gave
them
refuge
and
took
patroklos
into
his
house
and
reared
him
up
with
his
own
son
later
he
made
him
squire
to
achilles
these
two
grew
up
together
and
more
than
brothers
they
loved
each
other

bade
to
phthia
and
to
his
and
his
immortal
mother
and
he
and
patroklos
with
the
myrmidons
went
over
the
sea
to
aulis
and
joined
the
host
of
the
kings
and
princes
who
had
made
a
vow
not
to
refrain
from
war
until
they
had
taken

city
xi
achilles
became
the
most
renowned
of
all
the
heroes
who
strove
against
troy
in
the
years
the
fighting
went
on
before
the
sight
of
him
clad
in
the
flashing
armour
that
was
the
gift
of
zeus
and
standing
in
the
chariot
drawn
by
the
immortal
horses
the
trojan
ranks
would
break
and
the
trojan
men
would
flee
back
to
the
gate
of
their
city
and
many
lesser
cities
and
towns
around
troy
did
the
host
with
the
help
of
achilles
take
because
of
two
maidens
taken
captive
from
some
of
these
cities
a
quarrel
between
achilles
and
agamemnon
grew
up
one
of
the
maidens
was
called
chryseis
and
the
other
briseis
chryseis
was
given
to
agamemnon
and
briseis
to
achilles
illustration
father
of
chryseis
was
a
priest
of
apollo
and
when
the
maiden
his
daughter
was
not
given
back
to
him
he
went
and
prayed
the
god
to
avenge
him
on
the
host
apollo
listened
to
his
prayer
and
straightway
the
god
left
his
mountain
peak
with
his
bow
of
silver
in
his
hands
he
stood
behind
the
ships
and
shot
his
arrows
into
the
host
terrible
was
the
clanging
of
his
silver
bow
he
smote
the
beasts
of
the
camp
first
the
dogs
and
the
mules
and
the
horses
and
then
he
smote
the
men
and
those
whom
his
arrows
smote
were
stricken
by
the
plague
warriors
began
to
die
and
every
day
more
perished
by
the
plague
than
were
killed
by
the
spears
and
swords
and
arrows
of
the
trojans
now
a
council
was
summoned
and
the
chiefs
debated
what
was
to
be
done
to
save
the
host
at
the
council
there
was
a
soothsayer
named
kalchas
he
stood
up
and
declared
that
he
knew
the
cause
of
the
plague
and
he
knew
too
how
the
remainder
of
the
host
might
be
saved
from
it
was
because
of
the
anger
of
apollo
kalchas
said
and
that
anger
could
only
be
averted
by
agamemnon
sending
back
to
his
father
the
priest
of
apollo
the
maiden
chryseis
was
agamemnon
wroth
exceedingly
thou
seer
of
things
evil
said
he
to
kalchas
never
didst
thou
see
aught
of
good
for
me
or
mine
the
maiden
given
to
me
chryseis
i
greatly
prize
yet
rather
than
my
folk
should
perish
i
shall
let
her
be
taken
from
me
but
this
let
you
all
of
the
council
know
some
other
prize
must
be
given
to
me
that
the
whole
host
may
know
that
agamemnon
is
not
slighted
said
achilles
agamemnon
of
all
kings
you
are
the
most
covetous
the
best
of
us
toil
and
battle
that
you
may
come
and
take
what
part
of
the
spoil
may
please
you
be
covetous
no
more
let
this
maiden
go
back
to
her
father
and
afterwards
we
will
give
you
some
other
prize
agamemnon
the
council
here
must
bind
itself
to
give
me
recompense
still
you
speak
of
recompense
agamemnon
answered
achilles
no
one
gains
more
than
you
gain
i
had
no
quarrel
with
the
men
of
troy
and
yet
i
have
come
here
and
my
hands
bear
the
brunt
of
the
war
you
who
are
captains
must
give
me
a
recompense
said
agamemnon
or
else
i
shall
go
to
the
tent
of
achilles
and
take
away
the
maiden
given
to
him
briseis
of
the
fair
cheeks
i
am
wearied
of
making
war
for
you
answered
achilles
though
i
am
always
in
the
strife
but
little
of
the
spoil
comes
to
my
tent
now
will
i
depart
to
my
own
land
to
phthia
for
i
am
not
minded
to
stay
here
and
be
dishonoured
by
you
o
king
go
said
agamemnon
if
your
soul
be
set
upon
fleeing
go
but
do
not
think
that
there
are
not
captains
and
heroes
here
who
can
make
war
without
you
go
and
lord
it
amongst
your
myrmidons
never
shall
we
seek
your
aid
and
that
all
may
know
i
am
greater
than
you
achilles
i
shall
go
to
your
tent
and
take
away
the
maiden
briseis
he
heard
agamemnon
speech
the
heart
within
achilles
breast
was
divided
and
he
knew
not
whether
he
should
remain
still
and
silent
in
his
anger
or
thrusting
the
council
aside
go
up
to
agamemnon
and
slay
him
with
the
sword
his
hand
was
upon
the
when
an
immortal
appeared
to
him
the
goddess
athene
no
one
in
the
company
but
achilles
was
aware
of
her
presence
draw
not
the
sword
upon
agamemnon
she
said
for
equally
dear
to
the
gods
are
you
both
then
achilles
drew
back
and
thrust
his
heavy
sword
into
its
sheath
again
but
although
he
held
his
hand
he
did
not
refrain
from
angry
and
bitter
words
he
threw
down
on
the
ground
the
staff
that
had
been
put
into
his
hands
as
a
sign
that
he
was
to
be
listened
to
in
the
council
by
this
staff
that
no
more
shall
bear
leaf
or
blossom
he
said
i
swear
that
longing
for
achilles
aid
shall
come
upon
the
host
of
agamemnon
but
that
no
achilles
shall
come
to
their
help
i
swear
that
i
shall
let
hector
triumph
over
you
the
council
broke
up
and
achilles
with
patroklos
his
dear
comrade
went
back
to
their
tent
a
ship
was
launched
and
the
maiden
chryseis
was
put
aboard
and
odysseus
was
placed
in
command
the
ship
set
out
for
chryse
there
on
the
beach
they
found
the
priest
of
apollo
and
odysseus
placed
his
daughter
in
the
old
man
arms
they
made
sacrifice
to
apollo
and
thereafter
the
plague
was
averted
from
the
host
to
achilles
tent
there
came
the
messengers
of
the
king
and
they
took
briseis
of
the
fair
cheeks
and
led
her
away
achilles
in
bitter
anger
sat
by
the
sea
hard
in
his
resolve
not
to
help
agamemnon
men
no
matter
what
defeat
great
hector
inflicted
upon
them
xii
such
was
the
quarrel
dear
son
between
agamemnon
king
of
men
and
great
achilles
ah
because
of
that
quarrel
many
brave
men
and
great
captains
whom
i
remember
went
down
to
their
deaths
agamemnon
before
long
relented
and
he
sent
three
envoys
to
make
friendship
between
himself
and
achilles
the
envoys
were
odysseus
and
aias
and
the
old
man
phoinix
who
had
been
a
to
achilles
now
when
these
three
went
into
his
hut
they
found
achilles
sitting
with
a
lyre
in
his
hands
singing
to
the
music
he
made
his
song
was
of
what
thetis
his
had
told
him
concerning
his
own
fate
how
if
he
remained
in
the
war
against
troy
he
should
win
for
himself
imperishable
renown
but
would
soon
lose
his
life
and
how
if
he
left
the
war
his
years
in
his
own
land
should
be
long
although
no
great
renown
would
be
his
patroklos
his
dear
friend
listened
to
what
achilles
sang
and
achilles
sang
of
what
royal
state
would
be
his
if
he
gave
up
the
war
against
the
trojans
and
went
back
to
his
halls
old
peleus
would
welcome
him
and
he
would
seek
a
bride
for
him
from
amongst
the
loveliest
of
the
greek
maidens
in
three
days
he
sang
can
poseidon
god
of
the
sea
bring
me
to
my
own
land
and
to
my
father
royal
castle
well
dost
thou
sing
achilles
said
odysseus
to
him
and
pleasant
would
it
be
to
hear
thy
song
if
our
hearts
were
not
filled
up
with
great
griefs
but
have
not
nine
years
passed
away
since
we
came
here
to
make
war
on
troy
and
now
are
not
our
ships
timbers
rotted
and
their
tacklings
loosed
and
do
not
many
of
our
warriors
think
in
their
hearts
how
their
wives
and
children
have
long
been
waiting
for
their
return
and
still
the
walls
of
troy
rise
up
before
us
as
high
and
as
unconquerable
as
ever
no
wonder
our
hearts
are
filled
up
with
griefs
and
now
achilles
the
greatest
of
our
heroes
and
the
myrmidons
the
best
of
our
warriors
have
left
us
and
gone
out
of
the
fight
even
did
great
hector
turn
back
our
battalions
that
were
led
by
agamemnon
and
aias
and
diomedes
driving
us
to
the
wall
that
we
have
built
around
our
ships
behind
that
wall
we
halted
and
called
one
to
the
other
to
find
out
who
had
escaped
and
who
had
fallen
in
the
onslaught
hector
made
only
when
he
had
driven
us
behind
our
wall
did
hector
turn
back
his
chariot
and
draw
off
his
men
but
hector
has
not
gone
through
the
gates
of
the
city
look
now
achilles
his
chariots
remain
on
the
plain
lo
now
his
a
thousand
fires
thou
canst
see
and
beside
each
sits
fifty
warriors
with
their
horses
loose
beside
their
chariots
champing
barley
eagerly
they
wait
for
the
light
of
the
dawn
when
they
will
come
against
us
again
hoping
this
time
to
overthrow
the
wall
we
have
builded
and
come
to
our
ships
and
burn
them
with
fire
and
so
destroy
all
hope
of
our
return
we
are
all
stricken
with
grief
and
fear
even
agamemnon
weeps
we
have
seen
him
standing
before
us
like
unto
a
dark
fountain
breaking
from
some
beetling
cliff
how
else
could
he
but
weep
tears
it
may
be
he
shall
have
to
bid
the
host
draw
the
ships
to
the
water
and
depart
from
the
coast
of
troy
then
will
his
name
forever
be
dishonoured
because
of
defeat
and
the
loss
of
so
many
warriors
thou
i
grieve
for
agamemnon
griefs
odysseus
said
achilles
but
although
thou
dost
speak
of
agamemnon
thou
art
welcome
thou
and
thy
companions
even
in
my
wrath
you
three
are
dear
to
me
brought
them
within
the
hut
and
bade
a
feast
be
prepared
for
them
to
odysseus
aias
and
phoinix
wine
cups
were
handed
and
when
they
had
feasted
and
drunk
wine
odysseus
turned
to
where
achilles
sat
on
his
bench
in
the
light
of
the
fire
and
said
know
achilles
that
we
three
are
here
as
envoys
from
king
agamemnon
he
would
make
a
friendship
with
thee
again
he
has
injured
and
he
has
offended
thee
but
all
that
a
man
can
do
he
will
do
to
make
amends
the
maiden
briseis
he
will
let
go
back
many
gifts
will
he
give
thee
too
achilles
he
will
give
thee
seven
tripods
and
twenty
cauldrons
and
ten
talents
of
gold
yes
and
besides
twelve
royal
horses
each
one
of
which
has
triumphed
in
some
race
he
who
possesses
these
horses
will
never
lack
for
wealth
as
long
as
prizes
are
to
be
won
by
swiftness
and
harken
to
what
more
agamemnon
bade
us
say
to
thee
if
we
win
troy
he
will
let
thee
load
your
ship
with
spoil
of
the
city
with
gold
and
bronze
and
precious
stuffs
and
thereafter
if
we
win
to
our
homes
he
will
treat
thee
as
his
own
royal
son
and
will
give
thee
seven
cities
to
rule
over
and
if
thou
wilt
wed
there
are
three
daughters
in
his
hall
three
of
the
fairest
maidens
of
the
greeks
and
the
one
thou
wilt
choose
he
will
give
thee
for
thy
wife
chrysothemis
or
laodike
or
iphianassa
odysseus
spoke
and
then
aias
said
think
achilles
and
abandon
now
thy
wrath
if
agamemnon
be
hateful
to
thee
and
if
thou
despiseth
his
gifts
think
upon
thy
friends
and
thy
companions
and
have
pity
upon
them
even
for
our
sakes
achilles
arise
now
and
go
into
battle
and
stay
the
onslaught
of
the
terrible
hector
did
not
answer
his
lion
eyes
were
fixed
upon
those
who
had
spoken
and
his
look
did
not
change
at
all
for
all
that
was
said
the
old
man
phoinix
who
had
nurtured
him
went
over
to
him
he
could
not
speak
for
tears
had
burst
from
him
but
at
last
holding
achilles
hands
he
said
illustration
in
thy
father
house
did
i
not
rear
thee
to
greatness
even
thee
most
noble
achilles
with
me
and
with
none
other
wouldst
thou
go
into
the
feasthall
and
as
a
child
thou
stay
at
my
knee
and
eat
the
morsel
i
gave
and
drink
from
the
cup
that
i
put
to
thy
lips
i
reared
thee
and
i
suffered
and
toiled
much
that
thou
mightst
have
strength
and
skill
and
quickness
be
thou
merciful
in
thy
heart
achilles
be
not
wrathful
any
more
cast
aside
thine
anger
now
and
save
the
host
come
now
the
gifts
agamemnon
would
give
thee
are
very
great
and
no
king
nor
prince
could
despise
them
but
if
without
gifts
thou
enter
the
battle
then
above
all
heroes
the
host
would
honour
thee
answered
phoinix
gently
and
said
the
honour
the
host
would
bestow
upon
me
i
have
no
need
of
for
i
am
honoured
in
the
judgment
of
zeus
the
greatest
of
the
gods
and
while
breath
remains
with
me
that
honour
can
not
pass
away
but
do
thou
phoinix
stay
with
me
and
many
things
i
shall
bestow
upon
thee
even
the
half
of
my
kingdom
ah
but
urge
me
not
to
help
agamemnon
for
if
thou
dost
i
shall
look
upon
thee
as
a
friend
to
agamemnon
and
i
shall
hate
thee
my
as
i
hate
him
then
to
odysseus
achilles
spoke
and
said
son
of
laertes
wisest
of
men
harken
now
to
what
i
shall
say
to
thee
here
i
should
have
stayed
and
won
that
imperishable
renown
that
my
told
me
of
even
at
the
cost
of
my
young
life
if
agamemnon
had
not
aroused
the
wrath
that
now
possesses
me
know
that
my
soul
is
implacable
towards
him
how
often
did
i
watch
out
sleepless
nights
how
often
did
i
spend
my
days
in
bloody
battle
for
the
sake
of
agamemnon
and
his
brother
cause
why
are
we
here
if
not
because
of
lovely
helen
and
yet
one
whom
i
cherished
as
menelaus
cherished
helen
has
been
taken
from
me
by
order
of
this
king
he
would
let
her
go
her
way
now
but
no
i
do
not
desire
to
see
briseis
ever
again
for
everything
that
comes
from
agamemnon
hand
is
hateful
to
me
hateful
are
all
the
gifts
he
would
bestow
upon
me
and
him
and
his
treasures
i
hold
at
a
straw
worth
i
have
chosen
i
shall
have
my
myrmidons
draw
my
ships
out
to
the
sea
and
i
shall
depart
from
troy
for
my
own
land
aias
have
the
gods
achilles
put
into
your
breast
a
spirit
implacable
and
proud
above
all
men
spirits
yea
aias
said
achilles
my
spirit
can
not
contain
my
wrath
agamemnon
has
treated
me
not
as
a
leader
of
armies
who
won
many
battles
for
him
but
as
a
vile
sojourner
in
his
camp
go
now
and
declare
my
will
to
him
never
again
shall
i
take
thought
of
his
war
he
spoke
and
each
man
took
up
a
cup
and
poured
out
wine
as
an
offering
to
the
gods
then
odysseus
and
aias
in
sadness
left
the
hut
but
phoinix
remained
and
for
him
patroklos
the
dear
friend
of
achilles
spread
a
couch
of
fleeces
and
rugs
and
aias
went
along
the
shore
of
the
sea
and
by
the
line
of
the
ships
and
they
came
to
where
agamemnon
was
with
the
greatest
of
the
warriors
of
the
host
odysseus
told
them
that
by
no
means
would
achilles
join
in
the
battle
and
they
all
were
made
silent
with
grief
then
diomedes
the
great
horseman
rose
up
and
said
let
achilles
stay
or
go
fight
or
not
fight
as
it
pleases
him
but
it
is
for
us
who
have
made
a
vow
to
take
priam
city
to
fight
on
let
us
take
food
and
rest
now
and
let
us
go
against
hector
host
and
you
agamemnon
take
the
foremost
place
in
the
battle
diomedes
spoke
and
the
warriors
applauded
what
he
said
and
they
all
poured
out
libations
of
wine
to
the
gods
and
thereafter
they
went
to
their
huts
and
slept
but
for
agamemnon
the
king
there
was
no
sleep
that
night
before
his
eyes
was
the
blaze
of
hector
thousand
and
in
his
ears
were
the
sound
of
pipes
and
flutes
that
made
for
the
trojan
host
encamped
upon
the
plain
xiii
when
dawn
came
the
king
arrayed
himself
for
the
battle
putting
on
his
great
and
his
helmet
that
had
a
high
plume
of
fastening
about
his
legs
greaves
fitted
with
of
silver
and
hanging
round
his
shoulders
a
great
sword
that
shone
with
studs
of
gold
a
sword
that
had
a
silver
scabbard
fitted
with
golden
chains
over
his
shoulders
he
cast
a
great
lion
skin
and
he
took
upon
his
arm
a
shield
that
covered
the
whole
of
a
man
next
he
took
in
his
hands
two
strong
spears
of
bronze
and
so
arrayed
and
so
armed
he
was
ready
to
take
the
foremost
place
in
the
battle
cried
aloud
and
bade
the
greeks
arm
themselves
and
straightway
they
did
so
and
poured
from
behind
the
wall
that
guarded
their
ships
into
the
trojan
plain
then
the
chiefs
mounted
their
chariots
and
their
charioteers
turned
the
horses
towards
the
place
of
battle
on
the
high
ground
before
them
the
trojans
had
gathered
in
their
battalions
and
the
figure
of
great
hector
was
plain
to
agamemnon
and
his
men
like
a
star
that
now
and
then
was
hidden
by
a
cloud
so
he
appeared
as
he
went
through
the
battalions
all
covered
with
shining
bronze
spears
and
arrows
fell
upon
both
sides
footmen
kept
slaying
footmen
and
horsemen
kept
slaying
horsemen
with
the
sword
and
the
dust
of
the
plain
rose
up
stirred
by
the
thundering
hooves
of
the
horses
from
dawn
till
morning
and
from
morning
till
noon
the
battle
raged
but
at
the
greeks
broke
through
the
trojan
lines
then
agamemnon
in
his
chariot
rushed
through
a
gap
in
the
line
two
men
did
he
instantly
slay
and
dashing
onward
he
slew
two
warriors
who
were
sons
of
king
priam
like
fire
falling
upon
a
wood
and
burning
up
the
underwood
went
king
agamemnon
through
the
trojan
ranks
and
when
he
passed
many
horses
rattled
empty
chariots
leaving
on
the
earth
the
slain
warriors
that
had
been
in
them
and
through
the
press
of
men
and
up
to
the
high
walls
of
troy
did
agamemnon
go
slaying
trojan
warriors
with
his
spear
hector
did
not
go
nigh
him
for
the
gods
had
warned
hector
not
to
lead
any
onslaught
until
agamemnon
had
turned
back
from
battle
a
trojan
warrior
smote
king
agamemnon
on
the
below
the
elbow
and
the
point
of
his
spear
went
clean
through
still
he
went
through
the
ranks
of
the
trojans
slaying
with
spear
and
sword
and
then
the
blood
dried
upon
his
wound
and
a
sharp
pain
came
upon
him
and
he
cried
out
o
friends
and
captains
it
is
not
possible
for
me
to
war
for
ever
against
the
trojans
but
do
you
fight
on
to
keep
the
battle
from
our
ships
his
charioteer
turned
his
horses
and
they
all
covered
with
foam
and
grimed
with
dust
dashed
back
across
the
plain
bearing
the
wounded
king
from
that
day
battle
hector
sprang
to
the
onslaught
leaping
into
his
chariot
he
led
the
trojans
on
nine
captains
of
the
greeks
he
slew
in
the
first
onset
now
their
ranks
would
have
been
broken
and
the
greeks
would
have
fled
back
to
their
ships
if
odysseus
had
not
been
on
that
wing
of
the
battle
with
diomedes
the
great
horseman
odysseus
cried
out
come
hither
diomedes
or
verily
hector
will
sweep
us
across
the
plain
and
bring
the
battle
down
to
our
ships
illustration
these
two
forced
themselves
through
the
press
of
battle
and
held
back
the
onset
of
hector
till
the
greeks
had
their
chance
to
rally
hector
spied
them
and
swept
in
his
chariot
towards
them
diomedes
lifted
his
great
spear
and
flung
it
full
at
hector
the
bronze
of
the
spear
struck
the
bronze
of
his
helmet
and
bronze
by
bronze
was
turned
the
blow
told
upon
hector
but
he
springing
from
his
chariot
stayed
amongst
the
press
of
warriors
resting
himself
on
his
hands
and
knees
darkness
was
before
his
eyes
for
a
while
but
he
got
breath
again
and
leaping
back
into
his
chariot
drove
away
from
that
dangerous
place
diomedes
himself
received
a
bitterer
wound
for
paris
sheltering
himself
behind
a
pillar
on
the
plain
let
fly
an
arrow
at
him
it
went
clean
through
his
right
foot
odysseus
put
his
shield
before
his
friend
and
comrade
and
diomedes
was
able
to
draw
the
arrow
from
his
flesh
but
diomedes
was
fain
to
get
back
into
his
chariot
and
to
command
his
charioteer
to
drive
from
the
battle
odysseus
was
the
only
one
of
the
captains
who
stayed
on
that
side
of
the
battle
and
the
ranks
of
the
trojans
came
on
and
hemmed
him
round
one
warrior
struck
at
the
centre
of
his
shield
and
through
the
shield
the
strong
trojan
spear
passed
and
wounded
the
flesh
of
odysseus
he
slew
the
warrior
who
had
wounded
him
and
he
drew
the
spear
from
his
flesh
but
he
had
to
give
ground
but
loudly
as
any
man
ever
cried
odysseus
cried
out
to
the
other
captains
and
strong
aias
heard
him
and
drew
near
bearing
his
famous
shield
that
was
like
a
tower
the
trojan
warriors
that
were
round
him
drew
back
at
the
coming
of
aias
and
odysseus
went
from
the
press
of
battle
and
mounting
his
chariot
drove
away
aias
fought
the
trojans
gave
way
and
on
that
side
of
the
battle
they
were
being
driven
back
towards
the
city
but
suddenly
upon
aias
there
fell
an
unaccountable
dread
he
cast
behind
him
his
great
shield
and
he
stood
in
a
maze
like
a
wild
bull
turning
this
way
and
that
and
slowly
retreating
before
those
who
pressed
towards
him
but
now
and
again
his
valour
would
come
back
and
he
would
stand
steadily
and
with
his
great
shield
hold
at
bay
the
trojans
who
were
pressing
towards
the
ships
arrows
fell
thick
upon
his
shield
confusing
his
mind
and
aias
might
have
perished
beneath
the
arrows
if
his
comrades
had
not
drawn
him
to
where
they
stood
with
shields
sloping
for
a
shelter
and
so
saved
him
this
time
hector
was
fighting
on
the
left
wing
of
the
battle
against
the
greeks
who
were
led
by
nestor
and
idomeneus
and
on
this
side
paris
let
fly
an
arrow
that
brought
trouble
to
the
enemies
of
his
father
city
he
struck
machaon
who
was
the
most
skilled
healer
of
wounds
in
the
whole
of
the
host
and
those
who
were
around
machaon
were
fearful
that
the
trojans
would
seize
the
stricken
man
and
bear
him
away
then
said
idomeneus
nestor
arise
get
machaon
into
your
chariot
and
drive
swiftly
from
the
press
of
battle
a
healer
such
as
he
is
worth
the
lives
of
many
men
save
him
alive
so
that
we
may
still
have
him
to
draw
the
arrows
from
our
flesh
and
put
medicaments
into
our
wounds
then
did
nestor
lift
the
healer
into
his
chariot
and
the
charioteer
turned
the
horses
and
they
too
drove
from
the
press
of
battle
and
towards
the
hollow
ships
xiv
achilles
standing
by
the
stern
of
his
great
ship
saw
the
battle
as
it
went
this
way
and
that
way
but
his
heart
was
not
at
all
moved
with
pity
for
the
destruction
wrought
upon
the
greeks
he
saw
the
chariot
of
nestor
go
dashing
by
dragged
by
sweating
horses
and
he
knew
that
a
wounded
man
was
in
the
chariot
when
it
had
passed
he
spoke
to
his
dear
friend
patroklos
go
now
patroklos
he
said
and
ask
of
nestor
who
it
is
that
he
has
borne
away
from
the
battle
i
go
achilles
patroklos
said
and
even
as
he
spoke
he
started
to
run
along
the
line
of
the
ships
and
to
the
hut
of
nestor
stood
before
the
door
and
when
old
nestor
beheld
him
he
bade
him
enter
achilles
sent
me
to
you
revered
nestor
said
patroklos
to
ask
who
it
was
you
bore
out
of
the
battle
wounded
but
i
need
not
ask
for
i
see
that
it
is
none
other
than
machaon
the
best
of
our
healers
why
should
achilles
concern
himself
with
those
who
are
wounded
in
the
fight
with
hector
said
old
nestor
he
does
not
care
at
all
what
evils
befall
the
greeks
but
thou
patroklos
wilt
be
grieved
to
know
that
diomedes
and
odysseus
have
been
wounded
and
that
is
machaon
whom
thou
seest
here
ah
but
achilles
will
have
cause
to
lament
when
the
host
perishes
beside
our
burning
ships
and
when
hector
triumphs
over
all
the
greeks
the
old
man
rose
up
and
taking
patroklos
by
the
hand
led
him
within
the
hut
and
brought
him
to
a
bench
beside
which
lay
machaon
the
wounded
man
patroklos
said
nestor
speak
thou
to
achilles
nay
but
thy
father
bade
thee
spake
words
of
counsel
to
thy
friend
did
he
not
say
to
thee
achilles
from
harsh
courses
by
gentle
words
remember
now
the
words
of
thy
father
patroklos
and
if
ever
thou
speak
to
achilles
with
gentle
wisdom
speak
to
him
now
who
knows
but
thy
words
might
stir
up
his
spirit
to
take
part
in
the
battle
we
have
to
fight
with
hector
nay
nay
old
man
said
patroklos
i
may
not
speak
to
achilles
to
ask
for
such
a
thing
then
said
nestor
do
thou
thyself
enter
the
war
and
bring
myrmidons
with
thee
then
might
we
who
are
wearied
with
fighting
take
breath
and
beg
of
achilles
to
give
you
his
armour
that
you
may
wear
it
in
the
battle
if
thou
appear
clad
in
achilles
bronze
the
trojans
would
think
that
he
had
entered
the
war
again
and
they
would
not
force
the
fight
upon
us
old
nestor
said
seemed
good
to
patroklos
and
he
left
the
hut
and
went
back
along
the
ships
and
on
his
way
he
met
eurypylos
a
sorely
wounded
man
dragging
himself
from
the
battle
and
patroklos
helped
him
back
to
his
hut
and
cheered
him
with
discourse
and
laid
healing
herbs
upon
his
wounds
even
as
he
left
old
nestor
hut
hector
was
before
the
wall
the
greeks
had
builded
to
guard
their
ships
on
came
the
trojans
against
that
wall
holding
their
shields
of
bulls
hides
before
them
from
the
towers
that
were
along
the
wall
the
greeks
flung
great
stones
upon
the
attackers
the
host
an
eagle
flew
holding
in
its
talons
a
serpent
the
serpent
struggled
with
the
eagle
and
the
eagle
with
the
serpent
and
both
had
sorely
wounded
each
other
but
as
they
flew
over
the
host
of
greeks
and
trojans
the
serpent
struck
at
the
eagle
with
his
fangs
and
the
eagle
wounded
in
the
breast
dropped
the
serpent
then
were
the
trojans
in
dread
seeing
the
serpent
across
their
path
for
they
thought
it
was
an
omen
from
zeus
they
would
have
turned
back
from
the
wall
in
fear
for
this
omen
had
not
hector
pressed
them
on
one
omen
is
best
i
know
he
cried
to
fight
a
good
fight
for
our
country
forward
then
and
bring
the
battle
to
those
ships
that
came
to
our
coast
against
the
will
of
the
gods
hector
spoke
then
he
lifted
up
a
stone
such
a
stone
as
not
two
of
the
best
of
men
now
living
could
as
much
as
raise
from
the
ground
and
he
flung
this
stone
full
at
the
gate
it
broke
the
hinges
and
the
bars
and
the
great
gate
fell
under
the
weight
of
the
tremendous
stone
then
hector
leaped
across
it
with
two
spears
in
his
hands
no
warrior
could
withstand
him
now
and
as
the
trojans
scaled
the
walls
and
poured
across
the
broken
gate
the
greeks
fled
to
their
ships
in
terror
and
dismay
illustration
saw
the
gate
go
down
and
the
trojans
pour
towards
the
ships
in
a
mass
that
was
like
a
great
rock
rolling
down
a
cliff
idomeneus
and
aias
led
the
greeks
who
fought
to
hold
them
back
hector
cast
a
spear
at
aias
and
struck
him
where
the
belt
of
his
shield
and
the
belt
of
his
sword
crossed
aias
was
not
wounded
by
the
stroke
then
aias
cast
at
hector
a
great
stone
that
was
used
to
prop
a
ship
he
struck
him
on
the
breast
just
over
the
rim
of
his
shield
under
the
weight
of
that
blow
great
hector
spun
round
like
a
top
the
spear
fell
from
his
hands
and
the
bronze
of
his
shield
and
helmet
rang
as
he
fell
on
the
ground
the
greeks
dashed
up
to
where
hector
lay
hoping
to
drag
him
amongst
them
but
his
comrades
placed
their
shields
around
him
and
drove
back
the
warriors
that
were
pressing
round
they
lifted
hector
into
his
chariot
and
his
charioteer
drove
him
from
the
place
of
battle
groaning
heavily
from
the
hurt
of
that
terrible
blow
the
greeks
rallied
and
came
on
with
a
shout
driving
the
trojans
back
before
them
the
swift
horses
under
hector
chariot
brought
him
out
on
the
plain
they
who
were
with
him
lifted
him
out
and
hector
lay
gasping
for
breath
and
with
black
blood
gushing
from
him
and
then
as
he
lay
there
stricken
he
heard
the
voice
of
a
god
even
of
apollo
saying
hector
son
of
priam
why
dost
thou
lie
fainting
apart
from
the
host
dost
thou
not
know
that
the
battle
is
desperate
take
up
thy
spirit
again
bid
thy
charioteer
drive
thee
towards
the
ships
of
the
greeks
hector
rose
and
went
amongst
the
ranks
of
his
men
and
roused
up
their
spirits
and
led
them
back
to
the
wall
and
when
the
greeks
saw
hector
in
fighting
trim
again
going
up
and
down
the
ranks
of
his
men
they
were
affrighted
mounted
his
chariot
and
he
shouted
to
the
others
and
the
trojan
charioteers
lashed
their
horses
and
they
came
on
like
a
great
wave
they
crossed
the
broken
wall
again
and
came
near
the
ships
then
many
of
the
greeks
got
into
their
ships
and
struck
at
those
who
came
near
with
long
pikes
all
around
the
ships
companies
of
greek
warriors
stood
like
rocks
that
the
sea
breaks
against
in
vain
nestor
cried
out
to
the
greeks
bidding
them
fight
like
heroes
or
else
lose
in
the
burning
ships
all
hope
of
return
to
their
native
land
aias
a
long
pike
in
his
hand
drove
multitudes
of
trojans
back
while
in
a
loud
voice
he
put
courage
into
the
greeks
hector
fought
his
way
forward
crying
to
the
trojans
to
bring
fire
to
the
ships
that
had
come
to
their
coast
against
the
will
of
the
gods
came
to
the
first
of
the
ships
and
laid
his
hand
upon
its
stern
many
fought
against
him
there
swords
and
spears
and
armour
fell
on
the
ground
some
from
the
hands
some
off
the
shoulders
of
warring
men
and
the
black
earth
was
red
with
blood
but
hector
was
not
driven
away
from
the
ship
and
he
shouted
bring
fire
that
we
may
burn
the
ships
that
have
brought
the
enemy
to
our
land
the
woes
we
have
suffered
were
because
of
the
cowardice
of
the
elders
of
the
city
they
would
not
let
me
bring
my
warriors
here
and
bring
battle
down
to
the
ships
when
first
they
came
to
our
beach
do
not
let
us
return
to
the
city
until
we
have
burned
the
ships
with
fire
whoever
brought
fire
near
the
ship
was
stricken
by
strong
aias
who
stood
there
with
a
long
pike
in
his
hands
now
all
this
time
patroklos
sat
in
the
hut
of
eurypylos
the
wounded
man
he
had
succoured
cheering
him
with
discourse
and
laying
healing
herbs
on
his
wounds
but
when
he
saw
fire
being
brought
to
the
ships
he
rose
up
and
said
eurypylos
no
longer
may
i
stay
here
although
great
is
your
need
of
attendance
i
must
get
aid
for
our
warriors
straightway
he
ran
from
the
hut
and
came
to
where
achilles
was
if
thy
heart
achilles
he
said
is
still
hard
against
the
greeks
and
if
thou
wilt
not
come
to
their
aid
let
me
go
into
the
fight
and
let
me
take
with
me
thy
company
of
myrmidons
and
o
achilles
grant
me
another
thing
let
me
wear
thine
armour
and
thy
helmet
so
that
the
trojans
will
believe
for
a
while
that
achilles
has
come
back
into
the
battle
then
would
they
flee
before
me
and
our
warriors
would
be
given
a
illustration
achilles
i
have
declared
that
i
shall
not
cease
from
my
wrath
until
the
trojans
come
to
my
own
ships
but
thou
patroklos
dear
friend
go
into
the
battle
all
thou
hast
asked
shall
be
freely
given
to
thee
my
myrmidons
to
lead
and
my
armour
to
wear
and
even
my
chariot
and
my
immortal
horses
drive
the
trojans
from
the
ships
but
when
thou
hast
driven
them
from
the
ships
return
to
this
hut
do
not
go
near
the
city
return
i
bid
thee
patroklos
when
the
trojans
are
no
longer
around
the
ships
and
leave
it
to
others
to
battle
on
the
plain
patroklos
put
on
the
armour
that
zeus
had
given
to
father
peleus
round
his
shoulders
he
cast
the
sword
of
bronze
with
its
studs
of
silver
and
upon
his
head
he
put
the
helmet
with
its
high
crest
the
terrible
helmet
of
achilles
then
achilles
bade
the
charioteer
yoke
the
horses
to
the
chariot
the
horses
xanthos
and
balios
that
were
also
gifts
from
the
gods
and
while
all
this
was
being
done
achilles
went
amongst
the
myrmidons
making
them
ready
for
the
battle
and
bidding
them
remember
all
the
threats
they
had
uttered
against
the
trojans
in
the
time
when
they
had
been
kept
from
the
fight
he
went
back
to
his
hut
and
opening
the
chest
that
his
mother
thetis
had
given
him
he
took
from
it
a
cup
a
cup
that
no
one
drank
out
of
but
achilles
himself
then
pouring
wine
into
this
cup
and
holding
it
towards
heaven
achilles
prayed
to
zeus
the
greatest
of
the
gods
my
comrade
i
send
to
the
war
o
zeus
strengthen
his
heart
o
zeus
that
all
triumph
be
his
but
when
from
the
ships
he
hath
driven
the
spear
of
our
foes
out
of
the
turmoil
of
battle
may
he
to
me
return
scathless
with
arms
and
his
comrades
who
fight
hand
to
hand
achilles
prayed
and
the
myrmidons
beside
their
ships
shouted
in
their
eagerness
to
join
in
the
battle
xv
who
was
the
first
of
the
great
trojan
champions
to
go
down
before
the
onset
of
patroklos
the
first
was
sarpedon
who
had
come
with
an
army
to
help
hector
from
a
city
beyond
troy
he
saw
the
myrmidons
fight
round
the
ships
and
break
the
ranks
of
the
trojans
and
quench
the
fire
on
the
ship
he
saw
that
the
warrior
who
had
the
appearance
of
achilles
affrighted
the
trojans
so
that
they
turned
their
horses
heads
towards
the
city
the
myrmidons
swept
on
with
patroklos
at
their
head
now
when
he
saw
him
rushing
down
from
the
ships
sarpedon
threw
a
dart
at
patroklos
the
dart
did
not
strike
him
then
patroklos
flung
a
spear
and
struck
sarpedon
even
at
the
heart
he
fell
dead
from
his
chariot
and
there
began
a
battle
for
his
body
the
trojans
would
have
carried
it
into
the
city
so
that
they
might
bury
with
all
honour
the
man
who
had
helped
them
and
the
greeks
would
have
carried
it
away
so
that
having
his
body
and
his
armour
the
slaying
of
sarpedon
might
be
more
of
a
triumph
for
them
illustration
a
battle
for
his
body
went
on
now
sarpedon
comrade
glaukos
sought
out
hector
who
was
fighting
in
another
part
of
the
and
he
spoke
to
him
reproachfully
hector
he
said
art
thou
utterly
forgetful
of
those
who
came
from
their
own
country
to
help
thee
to
protect
thy
father
city
sarpedon
has
fallen
and
achilles
myrmidons
would
strip
him
of
his
armour
and
bring
his
body
to
the
ships
that
their
triumph
over
him
may
be
greater
still
disgraceful
will
it
be
to
thee
hector
if
they
win
that
triumph
when
this
was
said
to
him
did
not
delay
but
came
straight
to
the
spot
where
sarpedon
had
been
slain
the
greek
who
had
laid
hands
upon
the
body
he
instantly
slew
but
as
he
fought
on
it
suddenly
seemed
to
hector
that
the
gods
had
resolved
to
give
victory
to
the
greeks
and
his
spirit
grew
weary
and
hopeless
within
him
he
turned
his
heads
towards
the
city
and
galloped
from
the
press
of
battle
then
the
trojans
who
were
fighting
round
it
fled
from
the
body
of
sarpedon
and
the
greeks
took
it
and
stripped
it
of
its
armour
and
carried
the
body
to
their
ships
was
then
that
patroklos
forgot
the
command
of
achilles
the
command
that
he
was
not
to
bring
the
battle
beyond
the
ships
and
that
he
was
to
return
when
the
trojans
were
beaten
towards
their
city
patroklos
forgot
all
that
and
he
shouted
to
the
immortal
horses
xanthos
and
balios
that
drew
his
chariot
and
slaying
warrior
after
warrior
he
swept
across
the
plain
and
came
to
the
very
gates
of
troy
hector
was
within
the
gates
and
had
not
yet
left
his
chariot
then
there
came
and
stood
before
him
one
who
was
thought
to
be
the
god
apollo
but
who
then
had
the
likeness
of
a
mortal
man
hector
said
he
why
hast
thou
ceased
from
the
fight
behold
patroklos
is
without
the
gate
of
thy
father
city
turn
thy
horses
against
him
now
and
strive
to
slay
him
and
may
the
gods
give
thee
glory
hector
bade
his
charioteer
drive
his
horses
through
the
gate
and
into
the
press
of
battle
he
drew
near
to
patroklos
and
patroklos
leaping
down
from
his
chariot
seized
a
great
stone
and
flung
it
at
hector
charioteer
it
struck
him
on
the
brow
and
hurled
him
from
the
chariot
too
leaped
from
the
chariot
and
took
his
sword
in
hand
their
men
joined
patroklos
and
joined
hector
and
the
battle
began
beside
the
body
of
hector
charioteer
three
times
did
patroklos
rush
against
the
ranks
of
the
trojans
and
nine
warriors
did
he
slay
at
each
onset
but
the
doom
of
patroklos
was
nigh
a
warrior
smote
him
in
the
back
and
struck
the
helmet
from
his
head
with
its
high
crest
it
rolled
beneath
the
hooves
of
the
horses
who
was
it
smote
prince
patroklos
then
men
said
it
was
the
god
apollo
who
would
not
have
the
sacred
city
of
troy
taken
until
the
time
the
gods
had
willed
it
to
fall
spear
fell
from
his
hands
the
great
shield
that
achilles
had
given
him
dropped
on
the
ground
and
all
in
amaze
patroklos
stood
he
gave
ground
and
retreated
towards
his
comrades
then
did
hector
deal
him
the
stroke
that
slew
with
his
great
spear
he
struck
and
drove
it
through
the
body
of
patroklos
did
hector
exult
crying
patroklos
thou
didst
swear
that
thou
wouldst
sack
our
sacred
city
and
that
thou
wouldst
take
from
our
people
their
day
of
freedom
now
thou
hast
fallen
and
our
city
need
not
dread
thee
ever
any
more
said
patroklos
thou
mayst
boast
now
hector
although
it
was
not
thy
stroke
that
slew
me
apollo
stroke
it
was
that
sent
me
down
boast
of
my
slaying
as
thou
wilt
but
hear
my
saying
and
keep
it
in
thy
heart
thy
fate
too
is
measured
and
thee
achilles
will
slay
but
hector
did
not
heed
what
the
dying
patroklos
said
he
took
from
his
body
the
armour
of
achilles
that
had
been
a
gift
from
the
gods
the
body
too
he
would
have
brought
within
the
city
that
his
triumph
might
be
greater
but
now
aias
came
to
where
patroklos
had
fallen
and
over
the
body
he
placed
his
great
shield
the
fight
went
on
and
hector
withdrawing
himself
to
the
plain
put
upon
himself
the
armour
he
had
stripped
off
the
body
of
patroklos
the
armour
fitted
every
limb
and
joint
and
as
he
put
it
on
more
courage
and
strength
than
ever
yet
he
had
felt
came
into
the
soul
of
hector
illustration
the
immortal
steeds
that
patroklos
had
driven
having
galloped
from
the
battle
stood
apart
and
would
not
move
for
all
that
their
charioteer
would
do
they
stood
apart
with
their
heads
bowed
and
tears
flowed
from
their
eyes
down
on
the
ground
and
zeus
the
greatest
of
the
gods
saw
them
and
had
pity
upon
them
and
spoke
to
himself
saying
ah
immortal
steeds
why
did
i
give
ye
to
king
peleus
whose
generations
die
while
ye
remain
young
and
undying
was
it
that
ye
should
know
the
sorrows
that
befall
mortal
men
pitiful
indeed
is
the
lot
of
all
men
upon
the
earth
even
hector
now
who
boasteth
in
the
armour
that
the
gods
once
gave
will
shortly
go
down
to
his
death
and
the
city
he
defendeth
will
be
burned
with
fire
saying
he
put
courage
into
the
hearts
of
the
immortal
steeds
and
they
went
where
the
charioteer
would
have
them
go
and
they
came
safely
out
of
the
battle
hector
with
the
armour
of
achilles
upon
him
gathered
his
companies
together
and
brought
them
up
to
the
battle
to
win
and
carry
away
the
body
of
patroklos
but
each
one
who
laid
hands
upon
that
body
was
instantly
slain
by
aias
all
day
the
battle
went
on
for
the
greeks
would
say
to
each
other
comrades
let
the
earth
yawn
and
swallow
us
rather
than
let
the
trojans
carry
off
the
body
of
patroklos
and
on
their
side
the
trojans
would
say
friends
rather
let
us
all
be
slain
together
beside
this
man
than
let
one
of
us
go
backward
now
nestor
son
antilochos
who
was
fighting
on
the
left
of
the
battlefield
heard
of
the
slaying
of
patroklos
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
his
voice
was
choked
with
grief
and
he
dashed
out
of
the
battle
to
bring
the
grievous
tidings
to
the
hut
of
achilles
fallen
is
patroklos
he
cried
and
greeks
and
trojans
are
fighting
around
his
body
and
his
body
is
naked
now
for
hector
has
stripped
the
armor
from
it
then
achilles
fainted
away
and
his
head
lay
in
the
ashes
of
his
hut
he
woke
again
and
moaned
terribly
his
heard
the
sound
of
his
grief
as
she
sat
within
the
depths
of
the
ocean
she
came
to
him
as
he
was
still
moaning
terribly
she
took
his
hand
and
clasped
it
and
said
my
child
why
thou
achilles
ceased
his
moaning
and
answered
patroklos
my
dear
friend
has
been
slain
now
i
shall
have
no
joy
in
my
life
save
the
joy
of
slaying
hector
who
slew
my
friend
his
wept
when
she
heard
such
speech
from
achilles
you
will
be
my
son
she
said
for
it
is
appointed
by
the
gods
that
after
the
death
of
hector
your
death
will
come
straightway
then
let
me
die
said
achilles
since
i
let
my
friend
die
without
giving
him
help
o
that
i
had
not
let
my
wrath
overcome
my
spirit
here
i
stayed
a
useless
burthen
on
the
earth
while
my
comrades
and
my
own
dear
friend
fought
for
their
country
here
i
stayed
i
who
am
the
best
of
all
the
greeks
but
now
let
me
go
into
the
battle
and
let
the
trojans
know
that
achilles
has
come
back
although
he
tarried
long
but
thine
armour
my
son
said
thetis
thou
hast
no
armour
now
to
protect
thee
in
the
battle
go
not
into
it
until
thou
seest
me
again
in
the
morning
i
shall
return
and
i
shall
bring
thee
armour
that
hephaistos
the
smith
of
the
gods
shall
make
for
thee
she
spoke
and
she
turned
from
her
son
and
she
went
to
olympus
where
the
gods
have
their
dwellings
darkness
had
come
down
on
those
who
battled
round
the
body
of
patroklos
and
in
that
darkness
more
greeks
than
trojans
were
slain
it
seemed
to
the
greeks
that
zeus
had
resolved
to
give
the
victory
to
the
trojans
and
not
to
them
and
they
were
dismayed
but
four
greek
heroes
lifted
up
the
body
and
put
it
upon
their
shoulders
and
aias
and
his
brother
stood
facing
the
trojans
holding
them
back
while
the
four
tried
to
bear
the
body
away
the
trojans
pressed
on
striking
with
swords
and
axes
but
like
a
wooded
ridge
that
stretches
across
a
plain
and
holds
back
a
mighty
flood
aias
and
his
brother
held
their
ground
still
lay
in
his
hut
moaning
in
his
grief
and
the
servants
raised
loud
lamentations
outside
the
hut
the
day
wore
on
and
the
battle
went
on
and
hector
strove
against
aias
and
his
brother
then
the
figure
of
a
goddess
appeared
before
achilles
as
he
lay
on
the
ground
rouse
thee
achilles
she
said
or
hector
will
drag
into
troy
the
body
of
thy
friend
patroklos
achilles
goddess
iris
how
may
i
go
into
the
battle
since
the
trojans
hold
the
armour
that
should
protect
me
illustration
iris
the
messenger
of
the
gods
go
down
to
the
wall
as
thou
art
and
show
thyself
to
the
men
of
troy
and
it
may
be
that
they
will
shrink
back
on
seeing
thee
and
hearing
thy
voice
and
so
give
those
who
defend
the
body
of
patroklos
a
she
said
and
departed
then
achilles
arose
and
went
down
to
the
wall
that
had
been
built
around
the
ships
he
stood
upon
the
wall
and
shouted
across
the
trench
and
friends
and
foes
saw
him
and
heard
his
voice
around
his
head
a
flame
of
fire
arose
such
as
was
never
seen
before
around
the
head
of
a
mortal
man
and
seeing
the
flame
of
fire
around
his
head
and
hearing
his
terrible
voice
the
trojans
were
affrighted
and
stood
still
then
the
greeks
took
up
the
body
of
patroklos
and
laid
it
on
a
litter
and
bore
it
out
of
the
battle
xvi
now
thetis
the
mother
of
achilles
went
to
olympus
where
the
gods
have
their
dwellings
and
to
the
house
of
hephaistos
the
smith
of
the
gods
that
house
shone
above
all
the
houses
on
olympus
because
hephaistos
himself
had
made
it
of
shining
bronze
and
inside
the
house
there
were
wonders
handmaidens
that
were
not
living
but
that
were
made
out
of
gold
and
made
with
such
wondrous
skill
that
they
waited
upon
hephaistos
and
served
and
helped
him
as
though
they
were
living
maids
was
lame
and
crooked
of
foot
and
went
limping
he
and
thetis
were
friends
from
of
old
time
for
when
his
mother
would
have
forsaken
him
because
of
his
crooked
foot
thetis
and
her
sister
reared
him
within
one
of
the
ocean
caves
and
it
was
while
he
was
with
them
that
he
began
to
work
in
metals
so
the
lame
god
was
pleased
to
see
thetis
in
his
dwelling
and
he
welcomed
her
and
clasped
her
hand
and
asked
of
her
what
she
would
have
him
do
for
her
thetis
weeping
told
him
of
her
son
achilles
how
he
had
lost
his
dear
friend
and
how
he
was
moved
to
go
into
the
battle
to
fight
with
hector
and
how
he
was
without
armour
to
protect
his
life
seeing
that
the
armour
that
the
gods
had
once
given
his
father
was
now
in
the
hands
of
his
foe
and
thetis
besought
hephaistos
to
make
new
armour
for
her
son
that
he
might
go
into
the
battle
no
sooner
finished
speaking
than
hephaistos
went
to
his
and
set
his
bellows
twenty
were
there
working
and
the
twenty
bellows
blew
into
the
crucibles
and
made
bright
and
hot
fires
then
hephaistos
threw
into
the
fires
bronze
and
tin
and
silver
and
gold
he
set
on
the
a
great
anvil
and
took
in
one
hand
his
hammer
and
in
the
other
hand
his
tongs
illustration
the
armour
of
achilles
he
made
first
a
shield
and
then
a
corselet
that
gleamed
like
fire
and
he
made
a
strong
helmet
to
go
on
the
head
and
shining
greaves
to
wear
on
the
ankles
the
shield
was
made
with
five
folds
one
fold
of
metal
upon
the
other
so
that
it
was
so
strong
and
thick
that
no
spear
or
arrow
could
pierce
it
and
upon
this
shield
he
hammered
out
images
that
were
a
wonder
to
men
first
were
images
of
the
sun
and
the
moon
and
of
the
stars
that
the
shepherds
and
the
seamen
watch
the
pleiades
and
hyads
and
orion
and
the
bear
that
is
also
called
wain
and
below
he
hammered
out
the
images
of
two
cities
in
one
there
were
people
going
to
feasts
and
playing
music
and
dancing
and
giving
judgements
in
the
the
other
was
a
city
besieged
there
were
warriors
on
the
walls
and
there
was
an
army
marching
out
of
the
gate
to
give
battle
to
those
that
besieged
them
and
below
the
images
of
the
cities
he
made
a
picture
of
a
ploughed
field
with
ploughmen
driving
their
yokes
of
oxen
along
the
furrows
and
with
men
bringing
them
cups
of
wine
and
he
made
a
picture
of
another
field
where
men
were
reaping
and
boys
were
gathering
the
corn
where
there
was
a
servant
beneath
an
oak
tree
making
ready
a
feast
and
women
making
ready
barley
for
a
supper
for
the
men
who
were
reaping
and
a
king
standing
apart
and
watching
all
holding
a
staff
in
his
hands
and
rejoicing
at
all
he
saw
another
image
he
made
of
a
vineyard
with
clusters
of
grapes
that
showed
black
and
with
the
vines
hanging
from
silver
poles
and
he
showed
maidens
and
youths
in
the
vineyard
gathering
the
grapes
into
baskets
and
one
amongst
them
a
boy
who
played
on
the
viol
beside
the
image
of
the
vineyard
he
made
images
of
cattle
with
herdsmen
and
with
nine
dogs
guarding
them
but
he
showed
two
lions
that
had
come
up
and
had
seized
the
bull
of
the
herd
and
the
dogs
and
men
strove
to
drive
them
away
but
were
affrighted
and
beside
the
image
of
the
oxen
he
made
the
image
of
a
pasture
land
with
sheep
in
it
and
sheepfolds
and
roofed
huts
made
yet
another
picture
a
with
youths
and
maidens
dancing
their
hands
upon
each
others
hands
beautiful
dresses
and
wreaths
of
flowers
the
maidens
had
on
and
the
youths
had
daggers
of
gold
hanging
from
their
silver
belts
a
great
company
stood
around
those
who
were
dancing
and
amongst
them
there
was
a
minstrel
who
played
on
the
lyre
all
around
the
rim
of
the
shield
hephaistos
the
lame
god
set
an
image
of
ocean
whose
stream
goes
round
the
world
not
long
was
he
in
making
the
shield
and
the
other
wonderful
pieces
of
armour
as
soon
as
the
armour
was
ready
thetis
put
her
hands
upon
it
and
flying
down
from
olympus
like
a
hawk
brought
it
to
the
feet
of
achilles
her
son
achilles
when
he
saw
the
splendid
armour
that
hephaistos
the
lame
god
had
made
for
him
rose
up
from
where
he
lay
and
took
the
piece
in
his
hands
and
he
began
to
put
the
armour
upon
him
and
none
of
the
myrmidons
who
were
around
could
bear
to
look
upon
it
because
it
shone
with
such
brightness
and
because
it
had
all
the
marks
of
being
the
work
of
a
god
xvii
then
achilles
put
his
shining
armour
upon
him
and
it
fitted
him
as
though
it
were
wings
he
put
the
wonderful
shield
before
him
and
he
took
in
his
hands
the
great
spear
that
cheiron
the
centaur
had
given
to
peleus
his
father
that
spear
that
no
one
else
but
achilles
could
wield
he
bade
his
charioteer
harness
the
immortal
horses
xanthos
and
balios
then
as
he
mounted
his
chariot
achilles
spoke
to
the
horses
xanthos
and
balios
he
said
this
time
bring
the
hero
that
goes
with
you
back
safely
to
the
ships
and
do
not
leave
him
dead
on
the
plain
as
ye
left
the
hero
patroklos
xanthos
the
immortal
steed
spoke
answering
for
himself
and
his
comrade
achilles
he
said
with
his
head
bowed
and
his
mane
touching
the
ground
achilles
for
this
time
we
will
bring
thee
safely
back
from
the
battle
but
a
day
will
come
when
we
shall
not
bring
thee
back
when
thou
too
shalt
lie
with
the
dead
before
the
walls
of
troy
was
achilles
troubled
and
he
said
xanthos
my
steed
why
dost
thou
remind
me
by
thy
prophecies
of
what
i
know
already
that
my
death
too
is
appointed
and
that
i
am
to
perish
here
far
from
my
father
and
my
mother
and
my
own
land
he
drove
his
immortal
horses
into
the
battle
the
trojans
were
affrighted
when
they
saw
achilles
himself
in
the
fight
blazing
in
the
armour
that
hephaistos
had
made
for
him
they
went
backward
before
his
onset
and
achilles
shouted
to
the
captains
of
the
greeks
no
longer
stand
apart
from
the
men
of
troy
but
go
with
me
into
the
battle
and
let
each
man
throw
his
whole
soul
into
the
fight
on
the
trojan
side
hector
cried
to
his
captains
and
said
do
not
let
achilles
drive
you
before
him
even
though
his
hands
are
as
irresistible
as
fire
and
his
fierceness
as
terrible
as
flashing
steel
i
shall
go
against
him
and
face
him
with
my
spear
achilles
went
on
and
captain
after
captain
of
the
trojans
went
down
before
him
now
amongst
the
warriors
whom
he
caught
sight
of
in
the
fight
was
polydoros
the
brother
of
hector
and
the
youngest
of
all
king
priam
sons
priam
forbade
him
ever
to
go
into
the
battle
because
he
loved
him
as
he
would
love
a
little
child
but
polydoros
had
gone
in
this
day
trusting
to
his
fleetness
of
foot
to
escape
with
his
life
achilles
saw
him
and
pursued
him
and
slew
him
with
the
spear
hector
saw
the
death
of
his
brother
then
he
could
no
longer
endure
to
stand
aside
to
order
the
battle
he
came
straight
up
to
where
achilles
was
brandishing
his
great
spear
and
when
achilles
saw
hector
before
him
he
cried
out
here
is
the
man
who
most
deeply
wounded
my
soul
who
slew
my
dear
friend
patroklos
now
shall
we
two
fight
each
other
and
patroklos
shall
be
avenged
by
me
and
he
shouted
to
hector
now
hector
the
day
of
thy
triumph
and
the
day
of
thy
life
is
at
its
end
hector
answered
him
without
fear
not
with
words
achilles
can
you
affright
me
yet
i
know
that
thou
art
a
man
of
might
and
a
stronger
man
than
i
but
the
fight
between
us
depends
upon
the
will
of
the
gods
i
shall
do
my
best
against
thee
and
my
spear
before
this
has
been
found
to
have
a
dangerous
edge
spoke
and
lifted
up
his
spear
and
flung
it
at
achilles
then
the
breath
of
a
god
turned
hector
spear
aside
for
it
was
not
appointed
that
either
he
or
achilles
should
be
then
slain
achilles
darted
at
hector
to
slay
him
with
his
spear
but
a
god
hid
hector
from
achilles
in
a
thick
mist
in
a
rage
achilles
drove
his
chariot
into
the
ranks
of
the
war
and
many
great
captains
he
slew
he
came
to
skamandros
the
river
that
flows
across
the
plain
before
the
city
of
troy
and
so
many
men
did
he
slay
in
it
that
the
river
rose
in
anger
against
him
for
choking
its
waters
with
the
bodies
of
men
on
towards
the
city
he
went
like
a
fire
raging
through
a
glen
that
had
been
parched
with
heat
now
on
a
tower
of
the
walls
of
troy
priam
the
old
king
stood
and
he
saw
the
trojans
coming
in
a
rout
towards
the
city
and
he
saw
achilles
in
his
armour
blazing
like
a
star
like
that
star
that
is
seen
at
harvest
time
and
is
called
dog
the
star
that
is
the
brightest
of
all
stars
but
yet
is
a
sign
of
evil
and
the
old
man
priam
sorrowed
greatly
as
he
stood
upon
the
tower
and
watched
achilles
because
he
knew
in
his
heart
whom
this
man
would
slay
hector
his
son
the
protector
of
his
city
xviii
so
much
of
the
story
of
achilles
did
telemachus
the
son
of
odysseus
hear
from
the
lips
of
king
menelaus
as
he
sat
with
his
comrade
peisistratus
in
the
king
and
more
would
menelaus
have
told
them
then
if
helen
his
wife
had
not
been
seen
to
weep
weepst
thou
helen
said
menelaus
surely
i
know
it
is
because
the
words
that
tell
of
the
death
of
hector
are
sorrowful
to
thee
and
helen
the
lovely
lady
said
did
prince
hector
speak
a
hard
or
a
harsh
word
to
me
in
all
the
years
i
was
in
his
father
house
and
if
anyone
upbraided
me
he
would
come
and
speak
gentle
words
to
me
ah
greatly
did
i
lament
for
the
death
of
noble
hector
after
his
wife
and
his
mother
i
wept
the
most
for
him
and
when
one
speaks
of
his
slaying
i
can
not
help
but
weep
said
menelaus
your
heart
of
its
sorrow
helen
by
praising
hector
to
this
youth
and
by
telling
your
memories
of
him
i
shall
do
so
said
the
lady
helen
she
went
with
her
maids
from
the
hall
and
the
servants
took
telemachus
and
peisistratus
to
their
sleeping
places
the
next
day
they
sat
in
the
banqueting
hall
king
menelaus
and
telemachus
and
peisistratus
and
the
lady
helen
came
amongst
them
her
handmaidens
brought
into
the
hall
her
silver
that
had
wheels
beneath
it
with
rims
of
gold
and
her
golden
distaff
that
with
the
basket
had
been
presents
from
the
wife
of
the
king
of
egypt
and
helen
sat
in
her
chair
and
took
the
distaff
in
her
hands
and
worked
on
the
wool
that
was
in
her
basket
and
as
she
worked
she
told
telemachus
of
troy
and
of
its
guardian
hector
said
helen
old
men
were
at
the
gate
of
the
city
talking
over
many
things
and
king
priam
was
amongst
them
it
was
in
the
days
when
achilles
first
quarrelled
with
king
agamemnon
come
hither
my
daughter
said
king
priam
to
me
and
sit
by
me
and
tell
me
who
the
warriors
are
who
now
come
out
upon
the
plain
you
have
seen
them
all
before
and
i
would
have
you
tell
me
who
such
and
such
a
one
is
who
is
yon
hero
who
seems
so
mighty
i
have
seen
men
who
were
more
tall
than
he
by
a
head
but
i
have
never
seen
a
man
who
looked
more
royal
said
to
king
priam
the
hero
whom
you
look
upon
is
the
leader
of
the
host
of
the
greeks
he
is
the
renowned
king
agamemnon
he
looks
indeed
a
king
said
priam
tell
me
now
who
the
other
warrior
is
who
is
shorter
by
a
head
than
king
agamemnon
but
who
is
broader
of
chest
and
shoulder
he
is
odysseus
i
said
who
was
reared
in
rugged
ithaka
but
who
is
wise
above
all
the
kings
an
old
man
antenor
who
was
by
us
said
that
indeed
is
odysseus
i
remember
that
he
and
menelaus
came
on
an
embassy
to
the
assembly
of
the
trojans
when
they
both
stood
up
menelaus
seemed
the
greater
man
but
when
they
sat
down
odysseus
seemed
by
far
the
most
stately
when
they
spoke
in
the
assembly
menelaus
was
ready
and
skilful
of
speech
odysseus
when
he
spoke
held
his
staff
stiffly
in
his
hands
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
ground
we
thought
by
the
look
of
him
then
that
he
was
a
man
of
no
understanding
but
when
he
began
to
speak
we
saw
that
no
one
could
match
odysseus
his
words
came
like
in
winter
and
his
voice
was
very
resonant
priam
said
who
is
that
huge
warrior
i
think
he
is
taller
and
broader
than
any
of
the
rest
he
is
great
aias
i
said
who
is
as
a
bulwark
for
the
greeks
and
beside
him
stands
idomeneus
who
has
come
from
the
island
of
crete
around
him
stand
the
cretan
captains
so
i
spoke
but
my
heart
was
searching
for
a
sight
of
my
own
two
brothers
i
did
not
see
them
in
any
of
the
companies
had
they
come
with
the
host
i
wondered
and
were
they
ashamed
to
be
seen
with
the
warriors
on
account
of
my
i
wondered
as
i
looked
for
them
ah
i
did
not
know
that
even
then
my
two
dear
brothers
were
dead
and
that
the
earth
of
their
own
dear
land
held
them
came
to
the
gate
and
the
wives
and
daughters
of
the
trojans
came
running
to
him
asking
for
news
of
their
husbands
or
sons
or
brothers
whether
they
were
killed
or
whether
they
were
coming
back
from
the
battle
he
spoke
to
them
all
and
went
to
his
own
house
but
andromache
his
wife
was
not
there
and
the
housedame
told
him
that
she
had
gone
to
the
great
tower
by
the
wall
of
the
city
to
watch
the
battle
and
that
the
nurse
had
gone
with
her
bringing
their
infant
child
hector
went
down
the
street
and
came
to
the
gate
where
we
were
and
andromache
his
wife
came
to
meet
him
with
her
was
the
nurse
who
carried
the
little
child
that
the
folk
of
the
city
named
astyanax
calling
him
of
the
city
because
his
father
was
their
city
protector
hector
stretched
out
his
arms
to
the
little
boy
whom
the
nurse
carried
but
the
child
shrank
away
from
him
because
he
was
frightened
of
the
great
helmet
on
his
father
head
with
its
crest
then
hector
laughed
and
andromache
laughed
with
him
and
hector
took
off
his
great
helmet
and
laid
it
on
the
ground
then
he
took
up
his
little
son
and
dandled
him
in
his
arms
and
prayed
o
zeus
greatest
of
the
gods
grant
that
this
son
of
mine
may
become
valiant
and
that
like
me
he
may
be
protector
of
the
city
and
thereafter
a
great
king
so
that
men
may
say
of
him
as
he
returns
from
battle
greater
is
he
than
was
hector
his
father
saying
this
he
left
the
child
back
in
his
arms
and
to
andromache
his
wife
who
that
day
was
very
fearful
he
said
dear
one
do
not
be
over
sorrowful
you
urge
me
not
to
go
every
day
into
the
battle
but
some
days
to
stay
behind
the
walls
but
my
own
spirit
forbids
me
to
stay
away
from
battle
for
always
i
have
taught
myself
to
be
valiant
and
to
fight
in
the
forefront
illustration
he
said
and
he
put
on
his
helmet
again
and
went
to
order
his
men
and
his
wife
went
towards
the
house
looking
back
at
him
often
and
letting
her
tears
fall
down
thou
knowst
from
menelaus
story
what
triumphs
hector
had
thereafter
how
he
drove
the
greeks
back
to
their
ships
and
affrighted
them
with
his
thousand
upon
the
plain
how
he
drove
back
the
host
that
agamemnon
led
when
diomedes
and
odysseus
and
machaon
the
healer
were
wounded
how
he
broke
through
the
wall
that
the
greeks
had
builded
and
brought
fire
to
their
ships
and
how
he
slew
patroklos
in
the
armour
of
achilles
xix
king
priam
on
his
tower
saw
achilles
come
raging
across
the
plain
and
he
cried
out
to
hector
hector
beloved
son
do
not
await
this
man
onset
but
come
within
the
city
walls
come
within
that
thou
mayst
live
and
be
a
protection
to
the
men
and
women
of
troy
and
come
within
that
thou
mayst
save
thy
father
who
must
perish
if
thou
art
slain
hector
would
not
come
within
the
walls
of
the
city
he
stood
holding
his
shield
against
a
jutting
tower
in
the
wall
and
all
around
him
were
the
trojans
who
came
pouring
in
through
the
gate
without
waiting
to
speak
to
each
other
to
ask
who
were
yet
living
and
who
were
slain
and
as
he
stood
there
he
was
saying
in
his
heart
the
fault
is
mine
that
the
trojans
have
been
defeated
upon
the
plain
i
kept
them
from
entering
the
city
last
night
against
the
counsel
of
a
wise
man
for
in
my
pride
i
thought
it
would
be
easy
to
drive
achilles
and
the
greeks
back
again
and
defeat
them
utterly
and
destroy
their
hopes
of
return
now
are
the
trojans
defeated
and
dishonoured
and
many
have
lost
their
lives
through
my
pride
now
the
women
of
troy
will
say
by
trusting
to
his
own
might
has
brought
destruction
upon
the
whole
host
and
our
husbands
and
sons
and
brothers
have
perished
because
of
him
rather
than
hear
them
say
this
i
shall
face
achilles
and
slay
him
and
save
the
city
or
if
it
must
be
perish
by
his
spear
achilles
came
near
him
hector
spoke
to
him
and
said
my
heart
bids
me
stand
against
thee
although
thou
art
a
mightier
man
than
i
but
before
we
go
into
battle
let
us
take
pledges
one
from
the
other
with
the
gods
to
witness
that
if
i
should
slay
thee
i
shall
strip
thee
of
thine
armour
but
i
shall
not
carry
thy
body
into
the
city
but
shall
give
it
to
thine
own
friends
to
treat
with
all
honour
and
that
if
thou
should
slay
me
thou
shalt
give
my
body
to
my
friends
achilles
said
between
me
and
thee
there
can
be
no
pledges
fight
and
fight
with
all
thy
soldiership
for
now
i
shall
strive
to
make
thee
pay
for
all
the
sorrow
thou
hast
brought
to
me
because
of
the
slaying
of
patroklos
my
friend
spoke
and
raised
his
spear
and
flung
it
but
with
his
quickness
hector
avoided
achilles
spear
and
he
raised
his
own
saying
thou
hast
missed
me
and
not
yet
is
the
hour
of
my
doom
now
it
is
thy
turn
to
stand
before
my
spear
flung
it
but
the
wonderful
shield
of
achilles
turned
hector
spear
and
it
fell
on
the
ground
then
was
hector
downcast
for
he
had
no
other
spear
he
drew
his
sword
and
sprang
at
achilles
but
the
helmet
and
shield
of
achilles
let
none
of
hector
great
strokes
touch
his
body
and
achilles
got
back
into
his
hands
his
own
great
spear
and
he
stood
guarding
himself
with
his
shield
and
watching
hector
for
a
spot
to
strike
him
on
now
in
the
armour
that
hector
wore
the
armour
that
he
had
stripped
off
patroklos
there
was
a
point
at
the
neck
where
there
was
an
opening
as
hector
came
on
achilles
drove
at
his
neck
with
his
spear
and
struck
him
and
hector
fell
in
the
dust
achilles
stripped
from
him
the
armour
that
patroklos
had
worn
the
other
captains
of
the
greeks
came
up
and
looked
at
hector
where
he
lay
and
all
marvelled
at
his
size
and
strength
and
goodliness
and
achilles
dragged
the
body
at
his
chariot
and
drove
away
towards
the
ships
illustration
mother
standing
on
the
tower
on
the
wall
saw
all
that
was
done
and
she
broke
into
a
great
cry
and
all
the
women
of
troy
took
up
the
cry
and
wailed
for
prince
hector
who
had
guarded
them
and
theirs
from
the
foe
andromache
his
wife
did
not
know
the
terrible
thing
that
had
happened
she
was
in
an
inner
chamber
of
hector
house
weaving
a
great
web
of
cloth
and
broidering
it
with
flowers
and
she
had
ordered
her
handmaidens
to
heat
water
for
the
bath
so
that
hector
might
refresh
himself
when
he
came
in
from
the
fight
but
now
she
heard
the
wail
of
the
women
of
troy
fear
came
upon
her
for
she
knew
that
such
wailing
was
for
the
best
of
their
warriors
ran
from
her
chamber
and
out
into
the
street
and
came
to
the
battlements
where
the
people
stood
watching
she
saw
the
chariot
of
achilles
dashing
off
towards
the
ships
and
she
knew
that
it
dragged
the
dead
body
of
hector
then
darkness
came
before
her
eyes
and
she
fainted
away
her
husband
sisters
and
his
brothers
wives
thronged
round
her
and
lifted
her
up
and
at
last
her
life
came
back
to
her
and
she
wailed
for
hector
o
my
husband
she
cried
for
misery
were
we
two
born
now
thou
hast
been
slain
by
achilles
and
i
am
left
husbandless
and
ah
woe
for
our
young
child
strangers
shall
oppress
him
when
he
lives
amongst
people
that
care
not
for
him
or
his
and
he
will
come
weeping
to
me
his
widowed
mother
who
will
live
forever
sorrowful
thinking
upon
where
thou
liest
hector
by
the
ships
of
those
who
slew
thee
andromache
spoke
and
all
the
women
of
troy
joined
in
her
grief
and
wept
for
great
hector
who
had
protected
their
city
xx
now
that
hector
was
dead
king
priam
his
father
had
only
one
thought
in
his
mind
and
that
was
to
get
his
body
from
achilles
and
bring
it
into
the
city
so
that
it
might
be
treated
with
the
honour
befitting
the
man
who
had
been
the
guardian
of
troy
and
while
he
sat
in
his
grief
thinking
of
his
noble
son
lying
so
far
from
those
who
would
have
wept
over
him
behold
there
appeared
before
him
iris
the
messenger
of
zeus
the
greatest
of
the
gods
iris
said
to
him
king
thou
mayst
ransom
from
achilles
the
body
of
hector
thy
noble
son
go
thou
thyself
to
the
hut
of
achilles
and
bring
with
thee
great
gifts
to
offer
him
take
with
thee
a
wagon
that
thou
mayst
bring
back
in
it
the
body
and
let
only
one
old
henchman
go
with
thee
to
drive
the
mules
priam
when
he
heard
this
arose
and
went
into
his
treasure
chamber
and
took
out
of
his
chests
twelve
beautiful
robes
twelve
cloaks
twelve
soft
coverlets
and
ten
talents
of
gold
he
took
too
four
cauldrons
and
two
tripods
and
a
wonderful
goblet
that
the
men
of
thrace
had
given
him
when
they
had
come
on
an
embassy
to
his
city
then
he
called
upon
his
sons
and
he
bade
them
make
ready
the
wagon
and
load
it
with
the
treasures
he
had
brought
out
of
his
the
wagon
was
loaded
and
the
mules
were
yoked
under
it
and
when
priam
and
his
henchman
had
mounted
the
seats
hekabe
the
queen
wife
and
the
mother
of
hector
came
with
wine
and
with
a
golden
cup
that
they
might
pour
out
an
offering
to
the
gods
before
they
went
on
their
journey
that
they
might
know
whether
the
gods
indeed
favoured
it
or
whether
priam
himself
was
not
going
into
danger
king
priam
took
the
cup
from
his
wife
and
he
poured
out
wine
from
it
and
looking
towards
heaven
he
prayed
o
father
zeus
grant
that
i
may
find
welcome
under
roof
and
send
if
thou
wilt
a
bird
of
omen
so
that
seeing
it
with
mine
own
eyes
i
may
go
on
my
way
trusting
that
no
harm
will
befall
me
prayed
and
straightway
a
great
eagle
was
seen
with
wide
wings
spread
out
above
the
city
and
when
they
saw
the
eagle
the
hearts
of
the
people
were
glad
for
they
knew
that
their
king
would
come
back
safely
and
with
the
body
of
prince
hector
who
had
guarded
troy
priam
and
his
henchman
drove
across
the
plain
of
troy
and
came
to
the
river
that
flowed
across
and
there
they
let
their
mules
drink
they
were
greatly
troubled
for
dark
night
was
coming
down
and
they
knew
not
the
way
to
the
hut
of
achilles
they
were
in
fear
too
that
some
company
of
armed
men
would
come
upon
them
and
slay
them
for
the
sake
of
the
treasures
they
had
in
the
wagon
henchman
saw
a
young
man
coming
towards
them
and
when
he
reached
them
he
spoke
to
them
kindly
and
offered
to
guide
them
through
the
camp
and
to
the
hut
of
achilles
he
mounted
the
wagon
and
took
the
reins
in
his
hands
and
drove
the
mules
he
brought
them
to
the
hut
of
achilles
and
helped
priam
from
the
wagon
and
carried
the
gifts
they
had
brought
within
the
hut
know
king
priam
he
said
that
i
am
not
a
mortal
but
that
i
am
one
sent
by
zeus
to
help
and
companion
thee
upon
the
way
go
now
within
the
hut
and
speak
to
achilles
and
ask
him
for
his
father
sake
to
restore
to
thee
the
body
of
hector
thy
son
he
spoke
and
departed
and
king
priam
went
within
the
hut
there
great
achilles
was
sitting
and
king
priam
went
to
him
and
knelt
before
him
and
clasped
the
hands
of
the
man
who
had
slain
his
son
and
achilles
wondered
when
he
saw
him
there
for
he
did
not
know
how
one
could
have
come
to
his
hut
and
entered
it
without
being
seen
he
knew
then
that
it
was
one
of
the
gods
who
had
guided
this
man
priam
spoke
to
him
and
said
bethink
thee
achilles
upon
thine
own
father
he
is
now
of
an
age
with
me
and
perhaps
even
now
in
thy
country
there
are
those
who
make
him
suffer
pain
and
misery
but
however
great
the
pain
and
misery
he
may
suffer
he
is
happy
compared
to
me
for
he
knows
that
thou
his
son
art
still
alive
but
i
no
longer
have
him
who
was
the
best
of
my
sons
now
for
thy
father
sake
have
i
come
to
thee
achilles
to
ask
for
the
body
of
hector
my
son
i
am
more
pitiable
than
thy
father
or
than
any
man
for
i
have
come
through
dangers
to
take
in
my
hands
the
hands
that
slew
my
son
illustration
remembered
his
father
and
felt
sorrow
for
the
old
man
who
knelt
before
him
he
took
king
priam
by
the
hand
and
raised
him
up
and
seated
him
on
the
bench
beside
him
and
he
wept
remembering
old
peleus
his
father
called
his
handmaids
and
he
bade
them
take
the
body
of
hector
and
wash
it
and
wrap
it
in
two
of
the
robes
that
priam
had
brought
when
they
had
done
all
this
he
took
up
the
body
of
hector
and
laid
it
himself
upon
the
wagon
he
came
and
said
to
king
priam
thy
son
is
laid
upon
a
bier
and
at
the
break
of
day
thou
mayst
bring
him
back
to
the
city
but
now
eat
and
rest
here
for
this
night
priam
ate
and
he
looked
at
achilles
and
he
saw
how
great
and
how
goodly
he
was
and
achilles
looked
at
priam
and
he
saw
how
noble
and
how
kingly
he
looked
and
this
was
the
first
time
that
achilles
and
priam
the
king
of
troy
really
saw
each
other
they
gazed
on
each
other
king
priam
said
when
thou
goest
to
lie
down
lord
achilles
permit
me
to
lie
down
also
not
once
have
my
eyelids
closed
in
sleep

my
son

lost
his
life
and
now
i
have
tasted
bread
and
meat
and
wine
for
the
first
time
since
and
i
could

that
a
bed
be
made
in
the
portico
for
king
priam
and
his
henchman
but
before
they
went
achilles
said
tell
me

and
tell
me
truly
for
how
many
days
dost

to
make
a
funeral
for
hector
for
so
many
days

will
keep

the
battle
from

city
so
that
thou
mayst
make
the
funeral
in
peace
for
nine
days
we
would
watch
beside
hector
body
and
lament
for
him
on
the
tenth
day
we
would
have
the
funeral
on
the
eleventh
day
we
would
make
the
barrow
over
him
and
on
the
twelfth
day
we
would
fight
king
priam
said
even
for
twelve
days
i
will
hold
the
battle
back
from
the
city
said
achilles
priam
and
his
henchman
went
to
rest
but
in
the
middle
of
the
night
the
young
man
who
had
guided
him
to
the
hut
of
achilles
the
god
hermes
he
was
appeared
before
his
bed
and
bade
him
arise
and
go
to
the
wagon
and
yoke
the
mules
and
drive
back
to
the
city
with
the
body
of
hector
priam
aroused
his
henchman
and
they
went
out
and
yoked
the
mules
and
mounted
the
wagon
and
with
hermes
to
guide
them
they
drove
back
to
the
city
achilles
on
his
bed
thought
of
his
own
fate
how
he
too
would
die
in
battle
and
how
for
him
there
would
be
no
father
to
make
lament
but
he
would
be
laid
where
he
had
asked
his
friends
to
lay
him
beside
patroklos
and
over
them
both
the
greeks
would
raise
a
barrow
that
would
be
wondered
at
in
after
times
illustration
achilles
thought
and
afterwards
the
arrow
fired
by
paris
struck
him
as
he
fought
before
the
gate
of
the
city
and
he
was
slain
even
on
the
place
where
he
slew
hector
but
the
greeks
carried
off
his
body
and
his
armour
and
brought
them
back
to
the
ships
and
achilles
was
lamented
over
though
not
by
old
peleus
his
father
from
the
depths
of
the
sea
came
thetis
his
and
with
her
came
the
maidens
of
the
sea
they
covered
the
body
of
achilles
with
wonderful
raiment
and
over
it
they
lamented
for
seventeen
days
and
seventeen
nights
on
the
eighteenth
day
he
was
laid
in
the
grave
beside
patroklos
his
dear
friend
and
over
them
both
the
greeks
raised
a
barrow
that
was
wondered
at
in
the
xxi
now
hector
sister
was
the
first
to
see
her
father
coming
in
the
dawn
across
the
plain
of
troy
with
the
wagon
upon
which
his
body
was
laid
she
came
down
to
the
city
and
she
cried
through
the
streets
o
men
and
women
of
troy
ye
who
often
went
to
the
gates
to
meet
hector
coming
back
with
victory
come
now
to
the
gates
to
receive
hector
dead
every
man
and
woman
in
the
city
took
themselves
outside
the
gate
and
they
brought
in
the
wagon
upon
which
hector
was
laid
and
all
day
from
the
early
dawn
to
the
going
down
of
the
sun
they
wailed
for
him
who
had
been
the
guardian
of
their
city
father
took
the
body
to
the
house
where
hector
had
lived
and
he
laid
it
upon
his
bed
then
hector
wife
andromache
went
to
the
bed
and
cried
over
the
body

she
cried
thou
art
gone
from
life
and
thou
hast
left
me
a
widow
in
thy
house
our
child
is
yet
little
and
he
shall
not
grow
to
manhood
in
the
halls
that
were
thine
for
long
before
that
the
city
will
be
taken
and
destroyed
ah
how
can
it
stand
when
thou
who
wert
its
best
guardian
hast
perished
the
folk
lament
thee
hector
but
for
me
and
for
thy
little
son
doomed
to
grow
up
amongst
strangers
and
men
unfriendly
to
him
the
pain
for
thy
death
will
ever
abide
hekabe
hector
mother
went
to
the
bed
and
cried
of
all
my
children
thou
hector
wert
the
dearest
thou
wert
slain
because
it
was
not
thy
way
to
play
the
coward
ever
wert
thou
championing
the
men
and
women
of
troy
without
thought
of
taking
shelter
or
flight
and
for
that
thou
wert
slain
my
son
i
helen
went
to
the
bed
too
to
lament
for
noble
hector
of
all
the
friends
i
had
in
troy
thou
wert
the
dearest
hector
i
cried
never
did
i
hear
one
harsh
word
from
thee
to
me
who
brought
wars
and
troubles
to
thy
city
in
every
way
thou
wert
as
a
brother
to
me
therefore
i
bewail
thee
with
pain
at
my
heart
for
in
all
troy
there
is
no
one
now
who
is
friendly
to
me
did
the
king
and
the
folk
of
the
city
prepare
for
funeral
on
the
tenth
day
weeping
most
bitter
tears
they
bore
brave
hector
away
and
they
made
a
grave
for
him
and
over
the
grave
they
put
stones
and
over
it
all
they
raised
a
great
barrow
on
the
eleventh
day
they
feasted
at
king
priam
house
and
on
the
twelfth
day
the
battle
began
anew
xxii
for
many
days
telemachus
and
his
comrade
peisistratus
stayed
in
the
house
of
king
menelaus
on
the
evening
before
he
departed
menelaus
spoke
to
him
of
the
famous
deeds
of
his
father
odysseus
achilles
was
dead
said
menelaus
his
glorious
armour
was
offered
as
a
prize
for
the
warrior
whom
the
greeks
thought
the
most
of
two
men
strove
for
the
prize
odysseus
and
his
friend
aias
to
odysseus
the
armour
of
achilles
was
given
but
he
was
in
no
way
glad
of
the
prize
for
his
getting
it
had
wounded
the
proud
spirit
of
great
aias
was
fitting
that
odysseus
should
have
been
given
achilles
armour
for
no
warrior
in
the
host
had
done
better
than
he
but
odysseus
was
to
do
still
greater
things
for
us
he
knew
that
only
one
man
could
wield
a
bow
better
than
paris
paris
who
had
shot
with
an
arrow
achilles
and
who
after
that
had
slain
many
of
our
chiefs
that
man
was
philoctetes
he
had
come
with
agamemnon
host
to
troy
but
philoctetes
had
been
bitten
by
a
and
the
wound
given
him
was
so
terrible
that
none
of
our
warriors
could
bear
to
be
near
him
he
was
left
on
the
island
of
lemnos
and
the
host
lost
memory
of
him
but
odysseus
remembered
and
he
took
ship
to
lemnos
and
brought
philoctetes
back
with
his
great
bow
and
with
the
arrows
of
hercules
that
were
his
philoctetes
shot
at
paris
upon
the
wall
of
troy
and
slew
him
with
an
arrow
then
odysseus
devised
the
means
by
which
we
took
priam
city
at
last
he
made
us
build
a
great
wooden
horse
we
built
it
and
left
it
upon
the
plain
of
troy
and
the
trojans
wondered
at
it
greatly
and
odysseus
had
counselled
us
to
bring
our
ships
down
to
the
water
and
to
burn
our
stores
and
make
it
seem
in
every
way
that
we
were
going
to
depart
from
troy
in
weariness
this
we
did
and
the
trojans
saw
the
great
host
sail
away
from
before
their
city
but
they
did
not
know
that
a
company
of
the
best
of
our
warriors
was
within
the
hollow
of
the
wooden
horse
nor
did
they
know
that
we
had
left
a
spy
behind
to
make
a
signal
for
our
return
trojans
wondered
why
the
great
wooden
horse
had
been
left
behind
and
there
were
some
who
considered
that
it
had
been
left
there
as
an
offering
to
the
goddess
pallas
athene
and
they
thought
it
should
be
brought
within
the
city
others
were
wiser
and
would
have
left
the
wooden
horse
alone
but
those
who
considered
that
it
should
be
brought
within
prevailed
and
as
the
horse
was
too
great
to
bring
through
the
gate
they
flung
down
part
of
the
wall
that
they
might
bring
it
through
the
wooden
horse
was
brought
within
the
walls
and
left
upon
the
streets
of
the
city
and
the
darkness
of
the
night
fell
illustration
helen
my
wife
came
down
to
where
the
wooden
horse
was
and
she
suspecting
there
were
armed
men
within
walked
around
it
three
times
calling
to
every
captain
of
the
greeks
who
might
be
within
in
his
own
wife
voice
and
when
the
sound
of
a
voice
that
had
not
been
heard
for
so
many
years
came
to
him
each
of
the
captains
started
up
to
answer
but
odysseus
put
his
hands
across
the
mouth
of
each
and
so
prevented
them
from
being
discovered
had
left
a
spy
hidden
between
the
beach
and
the
city
now
when
the
wooden
horse
had
been
brought
within
the
walls
and
night
had
fallen
the
spy
lighted
a
great
fire
that
was
signal
to
the
ships
that
had
sailed
away
they
returned
with
the
host
before
the
day
broke
then
we
who
were
within
the
wooden
horse
broke
through
the
boards
and
came
out
on
the
city
with
our
spears
and
swords
in
our
hands
the
guards
beside
the
gates
we
slew
and
we
made
a
citadel
of
the
wooden
horse
and
fought
around
it
the
warriors
from
the
ships
crossed
the
wall
where
it
was
broken
down
and
we
swept
through
the
streets
and
came
to
the
citadel
of
the
king
thus
we
took
priam
city
and
all
its
treasures
and
thus
i
won
back
my
own
wife
the
lovely
helen
after
we
had
taken
and
sacked
king
priam
city
great
troubles
came
upon
us
some
of
us
sailed
away
and
some
of
us
remained
on
the
shore
at
the
bidding
of
king
agamemnon
to
make
sacrifice
to
the
gods
we
separated
and
the
doom
of
death
came
to
many
of
us
nestor
i
saw
at
lesbos
but
none
other
of
our
friends
have
i
ever
since
seen
agamemnon
my
own
brother
came
to
his
own
land
but
ah
it
would
have
been
happier
for
him
if
he
had
died
on
the
plain
of
troy
and
if
we
had
left
a
great
barrow
heaped
above
him
for
he
was
slain
in
his
own
house
and
by
one
who
had
married
the
wife
he
had
left
behind
when
the
ancient
one
of
the
sea
told
me
of
my
brother
doom
i
sat
down
upon
the
sand
and
wept
and
i
was
minded
to
live
no
more
nor
to
see
the
light
of
the
sun
of
thy
father
telemachus
i
have
told
thee
what
i
myself
know
and
what
was
told
me
of
him
by
the
ancient
one
of
the
sea
how
he
stays
on
an
island
where
the
nymph
calypso
holds
him
against
his
will
but
where
that
island
lies
i
do
not
know
odysseus
is
there
and
he
can
not
win
back
to
his
own
country
seeing
that
he
has
no
ship
and
no
companions
to
help
him
to
make
his
way
across
the
sea
but
odysseus
was
ever
master
of
devices
and
also
he
is
favoured
greatly
by
the
goddess
pallas
athene
for
these
reasons
telemachus
be
hopeful
that
your
father
will
yet
reach
his
own
home
and
country
xxiii
now
the
goddess
pallas
athene
had
thought
for
telemachus
and
she
came
to
him
where
he
lay
in
the
vestibule
of
menelaus
house
his
comrade
peisistratus
was
asleep
but
telemachus
was
wakeful
thinking
upon
his
father
athene
stood
before
his
bed
and
said
to
him
no
longer
shouldst
thou
wander
abroad
for
the
time
has
come
when
thou
shouldst
return
come
rouse
menelaus
and
let
him
send
thee
upon
thy
way
then
telemachus
woke
peisistratus
out
of
his
sleep
and
told
him
that
it
was
best
that
they
should
be
going
on
their
journey
but
peisistratus
said
until
it
is
dawn
telemachus
when
menelaus
will
come
to
us
and
send
us
on
our
way
then
when
it
was
light
king
menelaus
came
to
them
when
he
heard
that
they
would
depart
he
told
the
lady
helen
to
bid
the
maids
prepare
a
meal
for
them
he
himself
with
helen
his
wife
and
megapenthes
his
son
went
down
into
his
and
brought
forth
for
gifts
to
telemachus
a
cup
and
a
great
mixing
bowl
of
silver
and
helen
took
out
of
a
chest
a
beautiful
robe
that
she
herself
had
made
and
embroidered
they
came
to
telemachus
where
he
stood
by
the
chariot
with
peisistratus
ready
to
depart
then
menelaus
gave
him
the
beautiful
cup
that
had
been
a
gift
to
himself
from
the
king
of
the
sidonians
megapenthes
brought
up
the
great
bowl
of
silver
and
put
it
in
the
chariot
and
beautiful
helen
came
to
him
holding
the
embroidered
robe
too
have
a
gift
dear
child
for
thee
she
said
this
robe
home
and
leave
it
in
thy
mother
keeping
i
want
thee
to
have
it
to
give
to
thy
bride
when
thou
bringest
her
into
thy
father
halls
illustration
then
were
the
horses
yoked
to
the
chariot
and
telemachus
and
peisistratus
bade
farewell
to
menelaus
and
helen
who
had
treated
them
so
kindly
as
they
were
ready
to
go
menelaus
poured
out
of
a
golden
cup
wine
as
an
offering
to
the
gods
and
as
menelaus
poured
it
out
telemachus
prayed
that
he
might
find
odysseus
his
father
in
his
home
now
as
he
prayed
a
bird
flew
from
the
right
hand
and
over
the
heads
it
was
an
eagle
and
it
bore
in
its
claws
a
goose
that
belonged
to
the
farmyard
telemachus
asked
menelaus
was
this
not
a
sign
from
zeus
the
greatest
of
the
gods
then
said
helen
me
now
for
i
will
prophesy
from
this
sign
to
you
even
as
yonder
eagle
has
flown
down
from
the
mountain
and
killed
a
goose
of
the
farmyard
so
will
odysseus
come
from
far
to
his
home
and
kill
the
wooers
who
are
there
zeus
grant
that
it
be
so
said
telemachus
he
spoke
and
lashed
the
horses
and
they
sped
across
the
plain
when
they
came
near
the
city
of
pylos
telemachus
spoke
to
his
comrade
peisistratus
and
said
not
take
me
past
my
ship
son
of
nestor
thy
good
father
expects
me
to
return
to
his
house
but
i
fear
that
if
i
should
he
out
of
friendliness
would
be
anxious
to
make
me
stay
many
days
but
i
know
that
i
should
now
return
to
ithaka
the
son
of
nestor
turned
the
horses
towards
the
sea
and
they
drove
the
chariot
to
where
telemachus
ship
was
anchored
then
telemachus
gathered
his
followers
and
he
bade
them
take
on
board
the
presents
that
menelaus
and
helen
had
given
him
they
did
this
and
they
raised
the
mast
and
the
sails
and
the
rowers
took
their
seats
on
the
benches
a
breeze
came
and
the
sails
took
it
and
telemachus
and
his
companions
sailed
towards
home
and
all
unknown
to
the
youth
his
father
odysseus
was
even
then
nearing
his
home
part
ii
how
odysseus
left
calypso
island
and
came
to
the
land
of
the
ph√¶acians
how
he
told
he
fared
with
the
cycl√¥pes
and
went
past
the
terrible
scylla
and
charybdis
and
came
to
the
island
of
thrinacia
where
his
men
slaughtered
the
cattle
of
the
sun
how
he
was
given
a
ship
by
the
ph√¶acians
and
came
to
his
own
land
how
he
overthrew
the
wooers
who
wasted
his
substance
and
came
to
reign
again
as
king
of
ithaka
illustration
i
ever
mindful
was
pallas
athene
of
odysseus
although
she
might
not
help
him
openly
because
of
a
wrong
he
had
done
poseidon
the
god
of
the
sea
but
she
spoke
at
the
council
of
the
gods

she
won
from
zeus
a
pledge
that
odysseus
would
now
be
permitted
to
return
to
his
own
land
on
that
day
she
went
to
ithaka
and
appearing
to
telemachus
moved
him
as
has
been
told
to
go
on
the
voyage
in
search
of
his
father
and
on
that
day
too
hermes
by
the
will
of
zeus
went
to
ogygia
to
that
island
where
as
the
ancient
one
of
the
sea
had
shown
menelaus
odysseus
was
held
by
the
nymph
calypso
illustration
beautiful
indeed
was
that
island
all
round
the
cave
where
calypso
lived
was
a
blossoming
wood
alder
poplar
and
cypress
trees
were
there
and
on
their
branches
roosted
birds
falcons
and
owls
and
chattering
before
the
cave
was
a
soft
meadow
in
which
thousands
of
violets
bloomed
and
with
four
fountains
that
gushed
out
of
the
ground
and
made
clear
streams
through
the
grass
across
the
cave
grew
a
straggling
vine
heavy
with
clusters
of
grapes
calypso
was
within
the
cave
and
as
hermes
came
near
he
heard
her
singing
one
of
her
magic
songs
she
was
before
a
loom
weaving
the
threads
with
a
golden
shuttle
now
she
knew
hermes
and
was
pleased
to
see
him
on
her
island
but
as
soon
as
he
spoke
of
odysseus
and
how
it
was
the
will
of
zeus
that
he
should
be
permitted
to
leave
the
island
her
song
ceased
and
the
golden
shuttle
fell
from
her
hand
to
me
she
said
woe
to
any
immortal
who
loves
a
mortal
for
the
gods
are
always
jealous
of
their
love
i
do
not
hold
him
here
because
i
hate
odysseus
but
because
i
love
him
greatly
and
would
have
him
dwell
with
me
here
more
than
this
hermes
i
would
make
him
an
immortal
so
that
he
would
know
neither
old
age
nor
death
does
not
desire
to
be
freed
from
old
age
and
death
said
hermes
desires
to
return
to
his
own
land
and
to
live
with
his
dear
wife
penelope
and
his
son
telemachus
and
zeus
the
greatest
of
the
gods
commands
that
you
let
him
go
upon
his
way
have
no
ship
to
give
him
said
calypso
i
have
no
company
of
men
to
help
him
to
cross
the
sea
must
leave
the
island
and
cross
the
sea
zeus
commands
it
hermes
said
must
help
him
to
make
his
way
across
the
sea
if
it
must
be
so
calypso
said
then
she
bowed
her
head
and
hermes
went
from
her
straightway
calypso
left
her
cave
and
went
down
to
the
sea
by
the
shore
odysseus
stayed
looking
across
the
wide
sea
with
tears
in
his
eyes
she
came
to
him
and
she
said
not
sorrowful
any
more
odysseus
the
time
has
come
when
thou
mayst
depart
from
my
island
come
now
i
will
show
how
i
can
help
thee
on
thy
way
she
brought
him
to
the
side
of
the
island
where
great
trees
grew
and
she
put
in
his
hands
a
axe
and
an
adze
then
odysseus
started
to
hew
down
the
timber
twenty
trees
he
felled
with
his
axe
of
bronze
and
he
smoothed
them
and
made
straight
the
line
calypso
came
to
him
at
the
dawn
of
the
next
day
she
brought
augers
for
boring
and
he
made
the
beams
fast
he
built
a
raft
making
it
very
broad
and
set
a
mast
upon
it
and
fixed
a
rudder
to
guide
it
to
make
it
more
secure
he
wove
out
of
osier
rods
a
fence
that
went
from
stem
to
stern
as
a
bulwark
against
the
waves
and
he
strengthened
the
bulwark
with
wood
placed
behind
calypso
wove
him
a
web
of
cloth
for
sails
and
these
he
made
very
skilfully
then
he
fastened
the
braces
and
the
halyards
and
sheets
and
he
pushed
the
raft
with
levers
down
to
the
sea
that
was
on
the
fourth
day
on
the
fifth
calypso
gave
him
garments
for
the
journey
and
brought
provision
down
to
the
raft
two
skins
of
wine
and
a
great
skin
of
water
corn
and
many
dainties
she
showed
odysseus
how
to
guide
his
course
by
the
star
that
some
call
the
bear
and
others
the
wain
and
she
bade
farewell
to
him
he
took
his
place
on
the
raft
and
set
his
sail
to
the
breeze
and
he
sailed
away
from
ogygia
the
island
where
calypso
had
held
him
for
so
long
but
not
easily
or
safely
did
he
make
his
way
across
the
sea
the
winds
blew
upon
his
raft
and
the
waves
dashed
against
it
a
fierce
blast
came
and
broke
the
mast
in
the
middle
the
sail
and
the
fell
into
the
deep
then
odysseus
was
flung
down
on
the
bottom
of
the
raft
for
a
long
time
he
lay
there
overwhelmed
by
the
water
that
broke
over
him
the
winds
drove
the
raft
to
and
fro
the
south
wind
tossed
it
to
the
north
to
bear
along
and
the
east
wind
tossed
it
to
the
west
to
chase
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
there
was
a
nymph
who
saw
his
toils
and
his
troubles
and
who
had
pity
upon
him
ino
was
her
name
she
rose
from
the
waves
in
the
likeness
of
a
seagull
and
she
sat
upon
the
raft
and
she
spoke
to
odysseus
in
words
man
she
said
the
god
of
the
sea
is
still
wroth
with
thee
it
may
be
that
the
waters
will
destroy
the
raft
upon
which
thou
sailest
then
there
would
be
no
hope
for
thee
but
do
what
i
bid
thee
and
thou
shalt
yet
escape
strip
off
thy
garments
and
take
this
veil
from
me
and
wind
it
around
thy
breast
as
long
as
it
is
upon
thee
thou
canst
not
drown
but
when
thou
reachest
the
mainland
loose
the
veil
and
cast
it
into
the
sea
so
that
it
may
come
back
to
me
illustration
she
gave
him
the
veil
and
then
in
the
likeness
of
a
seagull
she
dived
into
the
sea
and
the
waves
closed
over
her
odysseus
took
the
veil
and
wound
it
around
his
breast
but
he
would
not
leave
the
raft
as
long
as
its
timbers
held
together
then
a
great
wave
came
and
shattered
the
raft
he
held
himself
on
a
single
beam
as
one
holds
himself
on
a
horse
and
then
with
the
veil
bound
across
his
breast
he
threw
himself
into
the
waves
for
two
nights
and
two
days
he
was
tossed
about
on
the
waters
when
on
the
third
day
the
dawn
came
and
the
winds
fell
he
saw
land
very
near
he
swam
eagerly
towards
it
but
when
he
drew
nearer
he
heard
the
crash
of
waves
as
they
struck
against
rocks
that
were
all
covered
with
foam
then
indeed
was
odysseus
afraid
a
great
wave
took
hold
of
him
and
flung
him
towards
the
shore
now
would
his
bones
have
been
broken
upon
the
rocks
if
he
had
not
been
enough
to
rush
towards
a
rock
and
to
cling
to
it
with
both
hands
until
the
wave
dashed
by
its
backward
drag
took
him
and
carried
him
back
to
the
deep
with
the
skin
stripped
from
his
hands
the
waves
closed
over
him
when
he
rose
again
he
swam
round
looking
for
a
place
where
there
might
be
not
rocks
but
some
easy
opening
into
the
land
at
last
he
saw
the
mouth
of
a
river
he
swam
towards
it
until
he
felt
its
stream
flowing
through
the
water
of
the
sea
then
in
his
heart
he
prayed
to
the
river
me
o
river
was
what
he
said
am
come
to
thee
as
a
suppliant
fleeing
from
the
anger
of
poseidon
god
of
the
sea
even
by
the
gods
is
the
man
pitied
who
comes
to
them
as
a
wanderer
and
a
hapless
man
i
am
thy
suppliant
o
river
pity
me
and
help
me
in
my
need
now
the
river
water
was
smooth
for
his
swimming
and
he
came
safely
to
its
mouth
he
came
to
a
place
where
he
might
land
but
with
his
flesh
swollen
and
streams
of
salt
water
gushing
from
his
mouth
and
nostrils
he
lay
on
the
ground
without
breath
or
speech
swooning
with
the
terrible
weariness
that
was
upon
him
but
in
a
while
his
breath
came
back
to
him
and
his
courage
rose
he
remembered
the
veil
that
the
had
given
him
and
he
loosened
it
and
let
it
fall
back
into
the
flowing
river
a
wave
came
and
bore
it
back
to
ino
who
caught
it
in
her
hands
but
odysseus
was
still
fearful
and
he
said
in
his
heart
me
what
is
to
befall
me
now
here
am
i
naked
and
forlorn
and
i
know
not
amongst
what
people
i
am
come
and
what
shall
i
do
with
myself
when
night
comes
on
if
i
lie
by
the
river
in
the
frost
and
dew
i
may
perish
of
the
cold
and
if
i
climb
up
yonder
to
the
woods
and
seek
refuge
in
the
thickets
i
may
become
the
prey
of
wild
beasts
he
went
from
the
cold
of
the
river
up
to
the
woods
and
he
found
two
olive
trees
growing
side
by
side
twining
together
so
that
they
made
a
shelter
against
the
winds
he
went
and
lay
between
them
upon
a
bed
of
leaves
and
with
leaves
he
covered
himself
over
there
in
that
shelter
and
with
that
warmth
he
lay
and
sleep
came
on
him
and
at
last
he
rested
from
perils
and
toils
ii
and
while
he
rested
the
goddess
pallas
athene
went
to
the
city
of
the
ph√¶acians
to
whose
land
odysseus
had
now
come
she
came
to
the
palace
of
the
king
and
passing
through
all
the
doors
came
to
the
chamber
where
the
king
daughter
nausicaa
slept
she
entered
into
nausicaa
dream
appearing
to
her
in
it
as
one
of
her
and
in
the
dream
she
spoke
to
the
princess
she
said
garments
of
your
household
are
all
uncared
for
and
the
time
is
near
when
more
than
ever
you
have
need
to
have
much
and
beautiful
raiment
your
marriage
day
will
be
soon
you
will
have
to
have
many
garments
ready
by
that
time
garments
to
bring
with
you
to
your
husband
house
and
garments
to
give
to
those
who
will
attend
you
at
your
wedding
there
is
much
to
be
done
nausicaa
be
ready
at
the
break
of
day
and
take
your
maidens
with
you
and
bring
the
garments
of
your
household
to
the
river
to
be
washed
i
will
be
your
mate
in
the
toil
beg
your
father
to
give
you
a
wagon
with
mules
to
carry
all
the
garments
that
we
have
need
to
illustration
so
in
her
dream
pallas
athene
spoke
to
the
princess
in
the
likeness
of
her
having
put
the
task
of
washing
into
her
mind
the
goddess
left
the
palace
of
the
king
and
the
country
of
the
ph√¶acians
nausicaa
when
she
rose
thought
upon
her
dream
and
she
went
through
the
palace
and
found
her
father
he
was
going
to
the
assembly
of
the
ph√¶acians
she
came
to
him
but
she
was
shy
about
speaking
of
that
which
had
been
in
her
dream
her
marriage
day
since
her
parents
had
not
spoken
to
her
about
such
a
thing
saying
that
she
was
going
to
the
river
to
wash
the
garments
of
the
household
she
asked
for
a
wagon
and
for
mules
many
garments
have
i
lying
soiled
she
said
and
thou
too
my
father
should
have
fresh
raiment
when
you
go
forth
to
the
assembly
of
the
ph√¶acians
and
in
our
house
are
the
two
unwedded
youths
my
brothers
who
are
always
eager
for
new
washed
garments
wherein
to
go
to
dances
her
father
smiled
on
her
and
said
mules
and
wagon
thou
mayst
have
nausicaa
and
the
servants
shall
get
them
ready
for
thee
now
he
called
to
the
servants
and
bade
them
get
ready
the
mules
and
the
wagon
then
nausicaa
gathered
her
maids
together
and
they
brought
the
soiled
garments
of
the
household
to
the
wagon
and
her
mother
so
that
nausicaa
and
her
maids
might
eat
while
they
were
from
home
put
in
a
basket
filled
with
dainties
and
a
skin
of
wine
also
she
gave
them
a
jar
of
so
that
they
might
rub
themselves
with
oil
when
bathing
in
the
river
young
nausicaa
herself
drove
the
wagon
she
mounted
it
and
took
the
whip
in
her
hands
and
started
the
mules
and
they
went
through
fields
and
by
farms
and
came
to
the
the
girls
brought
the
garments
to
the
stream
and
leaving
them
in
the
shallow
parts
trod
them
with
their
bare
feet
the
wagon
was
unharnessed
and
the
mules
were
left
to
graze
along
the
river
side
now
when
they
had
washed
the
garments
they
took
them
to
the
and
left
them
on
the
clean
pebbles
to
dry
in
the
sun
then
nausicaa
and
her
companions
went
into
the
river
and
bathed
and
sported
in
the
water
when
they
had
bathed
they
sat
down
and
ate
the
meal
that
had
been
put
on
the
wagon
for
them
the
garments
were
not
yet
dried
and
nausicaa
called
on
her
companions
to
play
straightway
they
took
a
ball
and
threw
it
from
one
to
the
other
each
singing
a
song
that
went
with
the
game
and
as
they
played
on
the
meadow
they
made
a
lovely
company
and
the
princess
nausicaa
was
the
tallest
and
fairest
and
noblest
of
them
all
before
they
left
the
river
side
to
load
the
wagon
they
played
a
last
game
the
princess
threw
the
ball
and
the
girl
whose
turn
it
was
to
catch
missed
it
the
ball
went
into
the
river
and
was
carried
down
the
stream
at
that
they
all
raised
a
cry
it
was
this
cry
that
woke
up
odysseus
who
covered
over
with
leaves
was
then
sleeping
in
the
shelter
of
the
two
olive
trees
illustration
he
crept
out
from
under
the
thicket
covering
his
nakedness
with
leafy
boughs
that
he
broke
off
the
trees
and
when
he
saw
the
girls
in
the
meadow
he
wanted
to
go
to
them
to
beg
for
their
help
but
when
they
looked
on
him
they
were
terribly
frightened
and
they
ran
this
way
and
that
way
and
hid
themselves
only
nausicaa
stood
still
for
pallas
athene
had
taken
fear
from
her
mind
odysseus
stood
a
little
way
from
her
and
spoke
to
her
in
a
beseeching
voice
supplicate
thee
lady
to
help
me
in
my
bitter
need
i
would
kneel
to
thee
and
clasp
thy
knees
only
i
fear
thine
anger
have
pity
upon
me
yesterday
was
the
twentieth
day
that
i
was
upon
the
sea
driven
hither
and
thither
by
the
waves
and
the
winds
and
still
nausicaa
stood
and
odysseus
looking
upon
her
was
filled
with
reverence
for
her
so
noble
she
seemed
know
not
as
i
look
upon
thee
he
said
thou
art
a
goddess
or
a
mortal
maiden
if
thou
art
a
mortal
maiden
happy
must
thy
father
be
and
thy
mother
and
thy
brothers
surely
they
must
be
proud
and
glad
to
see
thee
in
the
dance
for
thou
art
the
very
flower
of
maidens
and
happy
above
all
will
he
be
who
will
lead
thee
to
his
home
as
his
bride
never
have
my
eyes
beheld
one
who
had
such
beauty
and
such
nobleness
i
think
thou
art
like
to
the
young
i
once
saw
springing
up
by
the
altar
of
apollo
in
delos
a
tree
that
many
marvelled
to
look
at
o
lady
after
many
and
sore
trials
to
thee
first
of
all
the
people
have
i
come
i
know
that
thou
wilt
be
gracious
to
me
show
me
the
way
to
the
town
give
me
an
old
garment
to
cast
about
me
and
may
the
gods
grant
thee
thy
wish
and
heart
desire
a
noble
husband
who
will
cherish
thee
she
spoke
to
him
as
a
princess
should
seeing
that
in
spite
of
the
evil
plight
he
was
in
he
was
a
man
of
worth
she
said
thou
hast
come
to
our
land
thou
shalt
not
lack
for
raiment
nor
aught
else
that
is
given
to
a
suppliant
i
will
show
thee
the
way
to
the
town
also
he
asked
what
land
he
was
in
stranger
she
said
the
land
of
the
ph√¶acians
and
alcinous
is
king
over
them
and
i
am
the
daughter
nausicaa
then
she
called
to
her
companions
not
hide
yourselves
she
said
is
not
an
enemy
but
a
helpless
and
an
unfriended
man
we
must
befriend
him
for
it
is
well
said
that
the
stranger
and
the
beggar
are
from
god
the
girls
came
back
and
they
brought
odysseus
to
a
sheltered
place
and
they
made
him
sit
down
and
laid
a
garment
beside
him
one
brought
the
jar
of
olive
oil
that
he
might
clean
himself
when
he
bathed
in
the
river
and
odysseus
was
very
glad
to
get
this
oil
for
his
back
and
shoulders
were
all
crusted
over
with
flakes
of
brine
he
went
into
the
river
and
bathed
and
rubbed
himself
with
the
oil
then
he
put
on
the
garment
that
had
been
brought
him
so
well
he
looked
that
when
he
came
towards
them
again
the
princess
said
to
the
maids
now
on
the
man
who
a
while
ago
seemed
so
terrifying
he
is
most
handsome
and
stately
would
that
we
might
see
more
of
him
now
my
maidens
bring
the
stranger
meat
and
drink
they
came
to
him
and
they
served
him
with
meat
and
drink
and
he
ate
and
drank
eagerly
for
it
was
long
since
he
had
tasted
food
and
while
he
ate
nausicaa
and
her
companions
went
down
to
the
seashore
and
gathered
the
garments
that
were
now
dried
singing
songs
the
while
they
harnessed
the
mules
and
folded
the
garments
and
left
them
on
the
wagon
when
they
were
ready
to
go
nausicaa
went
to
odysseus
and
said
to
him
if
thou
wouldst
make
thy
way
into
the
city
come
with
us
now
so
that
we
may
guide
thee
but
first
listen
to
what
i
would
say
while
we
are
going
through
the
fields
and
by
the
farms
walk
thou
behind
keeping
near
the
wagon
but
when
we
enter
the
ways
of
the
city
go
no
further
with
us
people
might
speak
unkindly
of
me
if
they
saw
me
with
a
stranger
such
as
thou
they
might
say
who
does
nausicaa
bring
to
her
father
house
someone
she
would
like
to
make
her
husband
most
likely
so
that
we
may
not
meet
with
such
rudeness
i
would
have
thee
come
alone
to
my
father
house
listen
now
and
i
will
tell
thee
how
thou
mayst
do
this
is
a
grove
kept
for
the
goddess
pallas
athene
within
a
shout
of
the
city
in
that
grove
is
a
spring
and
when
we
come
near
i
would
have
thee
go
and
rest
thyself
by
it
then
when
thou
dost
think
we
have
come
to
my
father
house
enter
the
city
and
ask
thy
way
to
the
palace
of
the
king
when
thou
hast
come
to
it
pass
quickly
through
the
court
and
through
the
great
chamber
and
come
to
where
my
mother
sits
weaving
yarn
by
the
light
of
the
fire
my
father
will
be
sitting
near
drinking
his
wine
in
the
evening
pass
by
his
seat
and
come
to
my
mother
and
clasp
your
hands
about
her
knees
and
ask
for
her
aid
if
she
become
friendly
to
thee
thou
wilt
be
helped
by
our
people
and
wilt
be
given
the
means
of
returning
to
thine
own
land
so
nausicaa
bade
him
then
she
touched
the
mules
with
the
whip
and
the
wagon
went
on
odysseus
walked
with
the
maids
behind
as
the
sun
set
they
came
to
the
grove
that
was
outside
the
city
the
grove
of
pallas
athene
odysseus
went
into
it
and
sat
by
the
spring
and
while
he
was
in
her
grove
he
prayed
to
the
goddess
me
pallas
athene
and
grant
that
i
may
come
before
the
king
of
this
land
as
one
well
worthy
of
his
pity
and
his
help
iii
about
the
time
that
the
maiden
nausicaa
had
come
to
her
father
house
odysseus
rose
up
from
where
he
sat
by
the
spring
in
the
grove
of
pallas
athene
and
went
into
the
city
there
he
met
one
who
showed
him
the
way
to
the
palace
of
king
alcinous
the
doors
of
that
palace
were
golden
and
the
were
of
silver
and
there
was
a
garden
by
the
great
door
filled
with
fruitful
trees
pear
trees
and
pomegranates
apple
trees
and
trees
bearing
figs
and
olives
below
it
was
a
vineyard
showing
clusters
of
grapes
that
orchard
and
that
vineyard
were
marvels
for
in
them
never
fruit
fell
or
was
gathered
but
other
fruit
ripened
to
take
its
place
from
season
to
season
there
was
fruit
for
the
gathering
in
the
king
close
illustration
odysseus
stood
before
the
threshold
of
bronze
and
many
thoughts
were
in
his
mind
but
at
last
with
a
prayer
to
zeus
he
crossed
the
threshold
and
went
through
the
great
hall
now
on
that
evening
the
captains
and
the
councillors
of
the
ph√¶acians
sat
drinking
wine
with
the
king
odysseus
passed
by
them
and
stayed
not
at
the
king
chair
but
went
where
arete
the
queen
sat
and
he
knelt
before
her
and
clasped
her
knees
with
his
hands
and
spoke
to
her
in
supplication
queen
after
many
toils
and
perils
i
am
come
to
thee
and
to
thy
husband
and
to
these
thy
guests
may
the
gods
give
all
who
are
here
a
happy
life
and
may
each
see
his
children
in
safe
possession
of
his
halls
i
have
come
to
thee
to
beg
that
thou
wouldst
put
me
on
my
way
to
my
own
land
for
long
have
i
suffered
sore
affliction
far
from
my
friends
then
having
spoken
odysseus
went
and
sat
down
in
the
ashes
of
the
hearth
with
his
head
bowed
no
one
spoke
for
long
then
an
aged
councillor
who
was
there
spoke
to
the
king
alcinous
he
said
is
not
right
that
a
stranger
should
sit
in
the
ashes
by
thy
hearth
bid
the
stranger
rise
now
and
let
a
chair
be
given
him
and
supper
set
before
him
then
alcinous
took
odysseus
by
the
hand
and
raised
him
from
where
he
sat
and
bade
his
son
laodamas
give
place
to
him
he
sat
on
a
chair
inlaid
with
silver
and
the
housedame
brought
him
bread
and
wine
and
dainties
he
ate
and
king
alcinous
spoke
to
the
company
and
said
i
shall
call
you
together
and
we
will
entertain
this
stranger
with
a
feast
in
our
halls
and
we
shall
take
counsel
to
see
in
what
way
we
can
convoy
him
to
his
own
land
the
captains
and
councillors
assented
to
this
and
then
each
one
arose
and
went
to
his
own
house
odysseus
was
left
alone
in
the
hall
with
the
king
and
the
queen
now
arete
looking
closely
at
odysseus
recognized
the
mantle
he
wore
for
she
herself
had
wrought
it
with
her
handmaids
and
when
all
the
company
had
gone
she
spoke
to
odysseus
and
said
who
art
thou
didst
thou
not
speak
of
coming
to
us
from
across
the
deep
and
if
thou
didst
come
that
way
who
gave
thee
the
raiment
that
thou
hast
on
said
odysseus
for
seven
and
ten
days
i
sailed
across
the
deep
and
on
the
eighteenth
day
i
sighted
the
hills
of
thy
land
but
my
woes
were
not
yet
ended
the
storm
winds
shattered
my
raft
and
when
i
strove
to
land
the
waves
overwhelmed
me
and
dashed
me
against
great
rocks
in
a
desolate
place
at
length
i
came
to
a
river
and
i
swam
through
its
mouth
and
i
found
a
shelter
from
the
wind
there
i
lay
amongst
the
leaves
all
the
night
long
and
from
dawn
to
then
came
thy
daughter
down
to
the
river
i
was
aware
of
her
playing
with
her
friends
and
to
her
i
made
my
supplication
she
gave
me
bread
and
wine
and
she
bestowed
these
garments
upon
me
and
she
showed
an
understanding
that
was
far
beyond
her
years
then
said
alcinous
the
king
daughter
did
not
do
well
when
she
did
not
bring
thee
straight
to
our
house
odysseus
said
lord
do
not
blame
the
maiden
she
bade
me
follow
with
her
company
and
she
was
only
careful
that
no
one
should
have
cause
to
make
remarks
upon
the
stranger
whom
she
found
then
alcinous
the
king
praised
odysseus
and
said
that
he
should
like
such
a
man
to
abide
in
his
house
and
that
he
would
give
him
land
and
wealth
in
the
country
of
the
ph√¶acians
if
it
is
not
thy
will
to
abide
with
us
he
said
shall
give
thee
a
ship
and
a
company
of
men
to
take
thee
to
thy
own
land
even
if
that
land
be
as
far
as
eub√¶a
which
our
men
say
is
the
farthest
of
all
lands
as
he
said
this
odysseus
uttered
a
prayer
in
his
heart
father
zeus
grant
that
alcinous
the
king
may
fulfil
all
that
he
has
promised
and
for
that
may
his
fame
never
be
quenched
and
that
i
may
come
to
my
own
land
arete
now
bade
the
maids
prepare
a
bed
for
odysseus
this
they
did
casting
warm
coverlets
and
purple
blankets
upon
it
and
when
odysseus
came
to
the
bed
and
lay
in
it
after
the
tossing
of
the
waves
rest
in
it
seemed
wonderfully
good
at
dawn
of
day
he
went
with
the
king
to
the
assembly
of
the
ph√¶acians
when
the
princes
and
captains
and
councillors
were
gathered
together
alcinous
spoke
to
them
saying
and
captains
and
councillors
of
the
ph√¶acians
this
stranger
has
come
to
my
house
in
his
wanderings
and
he
desires
us
to
give
him
a
ship
and
a
company
of
men
so
that
he
may
cross
the
sea
and
come
to
his
own
land
let
us
as
in
times
past
we
have
done
for
others
help
him
in
his
journey
nay
let
us
even
now
draw
down
a
black
ship
to
the
sea
and
put
two
and
fifty
of
our
noblest
youths
upon
it
and
let
us
make
it
ready
for
the
voyage
but
before
he
departs
from
amongst
us
come
all
of
you
to
a
feast
that
i
shall
give
to
this
stranger
in
my
house
and
moreover
let
us
take
with
us
the
minstrel
of
our
land
blind
demodocus
that
his
songs
may
make
us
glad
at
the
feast
so
the
king
spoke
and
the
princes
captains
and
councillors
of
the
ph√¶acians
went
with
him
to
the
palace
and
at
the
same
time
two
and
fifty
youths
went
down
to
the
shore
of
the
sea
and
drew
down
a
ship
and
placed
the
masts
and
sails
upon
it
and
left
the
oars
in
their
leathern
loops
having
done
all
this
they
went
to
the
palace
where
the
feast
was
being
given
and
where
many
men
had
gathered
the
henchman
led
in
the
minstrel
blind
demodocus
to
him
the
gods
had
given
a
good
and
an
evil
fortune
the
gift
of
song
with
the
lack
of
sight
the
henchman
led
him
through
the
company
and
placed
him
on
a
seat
inlaid
with
silver
and
hung
his
lyre
on
the
pillar
above
his
seat
when
the
guests
and
the
minstrel
had
feasted
blind
demodocus
took
down
the
lyre
and
sang
of
things
that
were
already
famous
of
the
deeds
of
achilles
and
odysseus
now
when
he
heard
the
words
that
the
minstrel
uttered
odysseus
caught
up
his
purple
cloak
and
drew
it
over
his
head
tears
were
falling
down
his
cheeks
and
he
was
ashamed
of
their
being
seen
no
one
marked
his
weeping
except
the
king
and
the
king
wondered
why
his
guest
should
be
so
moved
by
what
the
minstrel
related
when
they
had
feasted
and
the
minstrel
had
sung
to
them
alcinous
said
us
go
forth
now
and
engage
in
games
and
sports
so
that
our
stranger
guest
may
tell
his
friends
when
he
is
amongst
them
what
our
young
men
can
do
all
went
out
from
the
palace
to
the
place
where
the
games
were
played
there
was
a
and
there
was
a
and
there
was
wrestling
and
all
the
youths
present
went
into
the
games
and
when
the
sports
were
ending
laodamas
the
son
of
king
alcinous
said
to
his
friends
my
friends
and
let
us
ask
the
stranger
whether
he
is
skilled
or
practised
in
any
sport
and
saying
this
he
went
to
odysseus
and
said
and
stranger
come
now
and
try
thy
skill
in
the
games
cast
care
away
from
thee
for
thy
journey
shall
not
be
long
delayed
even
now
the
ship
is
drawn
down
to
the
sea
and
we
have
with
us
the
company
of
youths
that
is
ready
to
help
thee
to
thine
own
land
illustration
said
odysseus
is
nearer
to
my
heart
than
sport
for
much
have
i
endured
in
times
that
are
not
far
then
a
youth
who
was
with
laodamas
euryalus
who
had
won
in
the
wrestling
bout
said
insolently
is
surely
mistaken
in
thinking
that
thou
shouldst
be
proficient
in
sports
as
i
look
at
thee
i
think
that
thou
art
one
who
makes
voyages
for
gain
a
trader
whose
only
thought
is
for
his
cargo
and
his
gains
then
said
odysseus
with
anger
hast
not
spoken
well
young
man
thou
hast
beauty
surely
but
thou
hast
not
grace
of
manner
nor
speech
and
thou
hast
stirred
the
spirit
in
my
breast
by
speaking
to
me
in
such
words
thereupon
clad
as
he
was
in
his
mantle
odysseus
sprang
up
and
took
a
weight
that
was
larger
than
any
yet
lifted
and
with
one
whirl
he
flung
it
from
his
hands
beyond
all
marks
it
flew
and
one
who
was
standing
far
off
cried
out
a
blind
man
stranger
might
know
that
thy
weight
need
not
be
confused
with
the
others
but
lies
far
beyond
them
in
this
bout
none
of
the
ph√¶acians
can
surpass
thee
and
odysseus
turning
to
the
youths
said
who
will
pass
that
throw
and
if
any
of
you
would
try
with
me
in
boxing
or
wrestling
or
even
in
the
let
him
stand
forward
anyone
except
laodamas
for
he
is
of
the
house
that
has
befriended
me
a
rude
man
he
would
surely
be
who
should
strive
with
his
host
illustration
all
kept
silence
then
alcinous
the
king
said
that
thou
shalt
have
something
to
tell
thy
friends
when
thou
art
in
thine
own
hand
we
shall
show
thee
the
games
in
which
we
are
most
skilful
for
we
ph√¶acians
are
not
perfect
boxers
or
wrestlers
but
we
excel
all
in
running
and
in
dancing
and
in
pulling
with
the
oar
lo
now
ye
dancers
come
forward
and
show
your
nimbleness
so
that
the
stranger
may
tell
his
friends
when
he
is
amongst
them
how
far
we
surpass
all
men
in
dancing
as
well
as
in
seamanship
and
speed
of
foot
a
place
was
levelled
for
the
dance
and
the
blind
minstrel
demodocus
took
the
lyre
in
his
hands
and
made
music
while
youths
skilled
in
the
dance
struck
the
ground
with
their
feet
odysseus
as
he
watched
them
marvelled
at
their
grace
and
their
spirit
when
the
dance
was
ended
he
said
to
the
king
lord
alcinous
thou
didst
boast
thy
dancers
to
be
the
best
in
the
world
and
thy
word
is
not
to
be
denied
i
wonder
as
i
look
upon
them
at
the
end
of
the
day
alcinous
spoke
to
his
people
and
said
stranger
in
all
that
he
does
and
says
shows
himself
to
be
a
wise
and
a
mighty
man
let
each
of
us
now
give
him
the
stranger
gift
here
there
are
twelve
princes
of
the
ph√¶acians
and
i
am
the
thirteenth
let
each
of
us
give
him
a
worthy
gift
and
then
let
us
go
back
to
my
house
and
sit
down
to
supper
as
for
euryalus
let
him
make
amends
to
the
stranger
for
his
rudeness
of
speech
as
he
offers
him
his
gift
all
assented
to
the
king
words
and
euryalus
went
to
odysseus
and
said
if
i
have
spoken
aught
that
offended
thee
may
the
storm
winds
snatch
it
and
bear
it
away
may
the
gods
grant
that
thou
shalt
see
thy
wife
and
come
to
thine
own
country
too
long
hast
thou
endured
afflictions
away
from
thy
friends
so
saying
euryalus
gave
odysseus
a
sword
of
bronze
with
a
silver
hilt
and
a
sheath
of
ivory
odysseus
took
it
and
said
to
you
my
friend
may
the
gods
grant
all
happiness
and
mayst
thou
never
miss
the
sword
that
thou
hast
given
me
thy
gracious
speech
hath
made
full
amends
each
of
the
twelve
princes
gave
gifts
to
odysseus
and
the
gifts
were
brought
to
the
palace
and
left
by
the
side
of
the
queen
and
arete
herself
gave
odysseus
a
beautiful
coffer
with
raiment
and
gold
in
it
and
alcinous
the
king
gave
him
a
beautiful
cup
all
of
gold
in
the
palace
the
bath
was
prepared
for
odysseus
and
he
entered
it
and
was
glad
of
the
warm
water
for
not
since
he
had
left
the
island
of
calypso
did
he
have
a
warm
bath
he
came
from
the
bath
and
put
on
the
beautiful
raiment
that
had
been
given
him
and
he
walked
through
the
hall
looking
a
king
amongst
men
illustration
now
the
maiden
nausicaa
stood
by
a
pillar
as
he
passed
and
she
knew
that
she
had
never
looked
upon
a
man
who
was
more
splendid
she
had
thought
that
the
stranger
whom
she
had
saved
would
have
stayed
in
her
father
house
and
that
one
day
he
would
be
her
husband
but
now
she
knew
that
by
no
means
would
he
abide
in
the
land
of
the
ph√¶acians
as
he
passed
by
she
spoke
to
him
and
said
o
stranger
and
when
thou
art
in
thine
own
country
think
sometimes
of
me
nausicaa
who
helped
thee
odysseus
took
her
hand
and
said
to
her
daughter
of
king
alcinous
may
zeus
grant
that
i
may
return
to
my
own
land
there
every
day
shall
i
pay
homage
to
my
memory
of
thee
to
whom
i
owe
my
life
he
passed
on
and
he
came
to
where
the
princes
and
captains
and
councillors
of
the
ph√¶acians
sat
his
seat
was
beside
the
king
then
the
henchman
brought
in
the
minstrel
blind
demodocus
and
placed
him
on
a
seat
by
a
pillar
and
when
supper
was
served
odysseus
sent
to
demodocus
a
portion
of
his
own
meat
he
spoke
too
in
praise
of
the
minstrel
saying
well
dost
thou
sing
of
the
greeks
and
all
they
wrought
and
suffered
as
well
methinks
as
if
thou
hadst
been
present
at
the
war
of
troy
i
would
ask
if
thou
canst
sing
of
the
wooden
horse
that
brought
destruction
to
the
trojans
if
thou
canst
i
shall
be
a
witness
amongst
all
men
how
the
gods
have
surely
given
thee
the
gift
of
song
demodocus
took
down
the
lyre
and
sang
his
song
told
how
one
part
of
the
greeks
sailed
away
in
their
ships
and
how
others
with
odysseus
to
lead
them
were
now
in
the
center
of
priam
city
all
hidden
in
the
great
wooden
horse
which
the
trojans
themselves
had
dragged
across
their
broken
wall
so
the
wooden
horse
stood
and
the
people
gathered
around
talked
of
what
should
be
done
with
so
wonderful
a
thing
whether
to
break
open
its
timbers
or
drag
it
to
a
steep
hill
and
hurl
it
down
on
the
rocks
or
leave
it
there
as
an
offering
to
the
gods
as
an
offering
to
the
gods
it
was
left
at
last
then
the
minstrel
sang
how
odysseus
and
his
comrades
poured
forth
from
the
hollow
of
the
horse
and
took
the
city
as
the
minstrel
sang
the
heart
of
odysseus
melted
within
him
and
tears
fell
down
his
cheeks
none
of
the
company
saw
him
weeping
except
alcinous
the
king
but
the
king
cried
out
to
the
company
saying
the
minstrel
cease
for
there
is
one
amongst
us
to
whom
his
song
is
not
pleasing
ever
since
it
began
the
stranger
here
has
wept
with
tears
flowing
down
his
cheeks
the
minstrel
ceased
and
all
the
company
looked
in
surprise
at
odysseus
who
sat
with
his
head
bowed
and
his
mantle
wrapped
around
his
head
why
did
he
weep
each
man
asked
no
one
had
asked
of
him
his
name
for
each
thought
it
was
more
noble
to
serve
a
stranger
without
knowing
his
name
said
the
king
speaking
again
a
brother
place
stands
the
stranger
and
the
suppliant
and
as
a
brother
art
thou
to
us
o
unknown
guest
but
wilt
thou
not
be
brotherly
to
us
tell
us
by
what
name
they
call
thee
in
thine
own
land
tell
us
too
of
thy
land
and
thy
city
and
tell
us
too
where
thou
wert
borne
on
thy
wanderings
and
to
what
lands
and
peoples
thou
earnest
and
as
a
brother
tell
us
why
thou
dost
weep
and
mourn
in
spirit
over
the
tale
of
the
going
forth
of
the
greeks
to
the
war
of
troy
didst
thou
have
a
kinsman
who
fell
before
priam
city
a
daughter
husband
or
a
wife
father
or
someone
nearer
by
blood
or
didst
thou
have
a
loving
friend
who
fell
there
one
with
an
understanding
heart
who
wast
to
thee
as
a
brother
such
questions
the
king
asked
and
odysseus
taking
the
mantle
from
around
his
head
turned
round
to
the
company
iv
then
odysseus
spoke
before
the
company
and
said
alcinous
famous
king
it
is
good
to
listen
to
a
minstrel
such
as
demodocus
is
and
as
for
me
i
know
of
no
greater
delight
than
when
men
feast
together
with
open
hearts
when
tables
are
plentifully
spread
when
pour
out
good
wine
into
cups
and
when
a
minstrel
sings
to
them
noble
songs
this
seems
to
me
to
be
happiness
indeed
but
thou
hast
asked
me
to
speak
of
my
wanderings
and
my
toils
ah
where
can
i
begin
that
tale
for
the
gods
have
given
me
more
woes
than
a
man
can
speak
of
first
of
all
i
will
declare
to
you
my
name
and
my
country
i
am
odysseus
son
of
laertes
and
my
land
is
ithaka
an
island
around
which
many
islands
lie
ithaka
is
a
rugged
isle
but
a
good
nurse
of
hardy
men
and
i
for
one
have
found
that
there
is
no
place
fairer
than
a
man
own
land
but
now
i
will
tell
thee
king
and
tell
the
princes
and
captains
and
councillors
of
the
ph√¶acians
the
tale
of
my
wanderings
wind
bore
my
ships
from
the
coast
of
troy
and
with
our
white
sails
hoisted
we
came
to
the
cape
that
is
called
malea
now
if
we
had
been
able
to
double
this
cape
we
should
soon
have
come
to
our
own
country
all
unhurt
but
the
north
wind
came
and
swept
us
from
our
course
and
drove
us
wandering
past
cythera
for
nine
days
we
were
borne
onward
by
terrible
winds
and
away
from
all
known
lands
on
the
tenth
day
we
came
to
a
strange
country
many
of
my
men
landed
there
the
people
of
that
land
were
harmless
and
friendly
but
the
land
itself
was
most
dangerous
for
there
grew
there
the
fruit
of
the
lotus
that
makes
all
men
forgetful
of
their
past
and
neglectful
of
their
future
and
those
of
my
men
who
ate
the
lotus
that
the
dwellers
of
that
land
offered
them
became
forgetful
of
their
country
and
of
the
way
before
them
they
wanted
to
abide
forever
in
the
land
of
the
lotus
they
wept
when
they
thought
of
all
the
toils
before
them
and
of
all
they
had
endured
i
led
them
back
to
the
ships
and
i
had
to
place
them
beneath
the
benches
and
leave
them
in
bonds
and
i
commanded
those
who
had
ate
of
the
lotus
to
go
at
once
aboard
the
ships
then
when
i
had
got
all
my
men
upon
the
ships
we
made
haste
to
sail
away
illustration
we
came
to
the
land
of
the
cycl√¥pes
a
giant
people
there
is
a
waste
island
outside
the
harbour
of
their
land
and
on
it
there
is
a
well
of
bright
water
that
has
poplars
growing
round
it
we
came
to
that
empty
island
and
we
beached
our
ships
and
took
down
our
sails
soon
as
the
dawn
came
we
went
through
the
empty
island
starting
the
wild
goats
that
were
there
in
flocks
and
shooting
them
with
our
arrows
we
killed
so
many
wild
goats
there
that
we
had
nine
for
each
ship
afterwards
we
looked
across
to
the
land
of
the
cycl√¥pes
and
we
heard
the
sound
of
voices
and
saw
the
smoke
of
fires
and
heard
the
bleating
of
flocks
of
sheep
and
goats
called
my
companions
together
and
i
said
it
would
be
well
for
some
of
us
to
go
to
that
other
island
with
my
own
ship
and
with
the
company
that
is
on
it
i
shall
go
there
the
rest
of
you
abide
here
i
will
find
out
what
manner
of
men
live
there
and
whether
they
will
treat
us
kindly
and
give
us
gifts
that
are
due
to
strangers
gifts
of
provisions
for
our
voyage
e
embarked
and
we
came
to
the
land
there
was
a
cave
near
the
sea
and
round
the
cave
there
were
mighty
flocks
of
sheep
and
goats
i
took
twelve
men
with
me
and
i
left
the
rest
to
guard
the
ship
we
went
into
the
cave
and
found
no
man
there
there
were
baskets
filled
with
cheeses
and
vessels
of
whey
and
pails
and
bowls
of
milk
my
men
wanted
me
to
take
some
of
the
cheeses
and
drive
off
some
of
the
lambs
and
kids
and
come
away
but
this
i
would
not
do
for
i
would
rather
that
he
who
owned
the
stores
would
give
us
of
his
own
free
will
the
offerings
that
were
due
to
strangers
we
were
in
the
cave
he
whose
dwelling
it
was
returned
to
it
he
carried
on
his
shoulder
a
great
pile
of
wood
for
his
fire
never
in
our
lives
did
we
see
a
creature
so
frightful
as
this
cyclops
was
he
was
a
giant
in
size
and
what
made
him
terrible
to
behold
he
had
but
one
eye
and
that
single
eye
was
in
his
forehead
he
cast
down
on
the
ground
the
pile
of
wood
that
he
carried
making
such
a
din
that
we
fled
in
terror
into
the
corners
and
recesses
of
the
cave
next
he
drove
his
flocks
into
the
cave
and
began
to
milk
his
ewes
and
goats
and
when
he
had
the
flocks
within
he
took
up
a
stone
that
not
all
our
strengths
could
move
and
set
it
as
a
door
to
the
mouth
of
the
cave
cyclops
kindled
his
fire
and
when
it
blazed
up
he
saw
us
in
the
corners
and
recesses
he
spoke
to
us
we
knew
not
what
he
said
but
our
hearts
were
shaken
with
terror
at
the
sound
of
his
deep
voice
spoke
to
him
saying
that
we
were
agamemnon
men
on
our
way
home
from
the
taking
of
priam
city
and
i
begged
him
to
deal
with
us
kindly
for
the
sake
of
zeus
who
is
ever
in
the
company
of
strangers
and
suppliants
but
he
answered
me
saying
we
cycl√¥pes
pay
no
heed
to
zeus
nor
to
any
of
thy
gods
in
our
strength
and
our
power
we
deem
that
we
are
mightier
than
they
i
will
not
spare
thee
neither
will
i
give
thee
aught
for
the
sake
of
zeus
but
only
as
my
own
spirit
bids
me
and
first
i
would
have
thee
tell
me
how
you
came
to
our
laud
knew
it
would
be
better
not
to
let
the
cyclops
know
that
my
ship
and
my
companions
were
at
the
harbour
of
the
island
therefore
i
spoke
to
him
guilefully
telling
him
that
my
ship
had
been
broken
on
the
rocks
and
that
i
and
the
men
with
me
were
the
only
ones
who
had
escaped
utter
doom
begged
again
that
he
would
deal
with
us
as
just
men
deal
with
strangers
and
suppliants
but
he
without
saying
a
word
laid
hands
upon
two
of
my
men
and
swinging
them
by
the
legs
dashed
their
brains
out
on
the
earth
he
cut
them
to
pieces
and
ate
them
before
our
very
eyes
we
wept
and
we
prayed
to
zeus
as
we
witnessed
a
deed
so
terrible
the
cyclops
stretched
himself
amongst
his
sheep
and
went
to
sleep
beside
the
fire
then
i
debated
whether
i
should
take
my
sharp
sword
in
my
hand
and
feeling
where
his
heart
was
stab
him
there
but
second
thoughts
held
me
back
from
doing
this
i
might
be
able
to
kill
him
as
he
slept
but
not
even
with
my
companions
could
i
roll
away
the
great
stone
that
closed
the
mouth
of
the
cave
came
and
the
cyclops
awakened
kindled
his
fire
and
milked
his
flocks
then
he
seized
two
others
of
my
men
and
made
ready
for
his
meal
and
now
he
rolled
away
the
great
stone
and
drove
his
flocks
out
of
the
cave
illustration
had
pondered
on
a
way
of
escape
and
i
had
thought
of
something
that
might
be
done
to
baffle
the
cyclops
i
had
with
me
a
great
skin
of
sweet
wine
and
i
thought
that
if
i
could
make
him
drunken
with
wine
i
and
my
companions
might
be
able
for
him
but
there
were
other
preparations
to
be
made
first
on
the
floor
of
the
cave
there
was
a
great
beam
of
olive
wood
which
the
cyclops
had
cut
to
make
a
club
when
the
wood
should
be
seasoned
it
was
yet
green
i
and
my
companions
went
and
cut
off
a
fathom
length
of
the
wood
and
sharpened
it
to
a
point
and
took
it
to
the
fire
and
hardened
it
in
the
glow
then
i
hid
the
beam
in
a
recess
of
the
cave
cyclops
came
back
in
the
evening
and
opening
up
the
cave
drove
in
his
flocks
then
he
closed
the
cave
again
with
the
stone
and
went
and
milked
his
ewes
and
his
goats
again
he
seized
two
of
my
companions
i
went
to
the
terrible
creature
with
a
bowl
of
wine
in
my
hands
he
took
it
and
drank
it
and
cried
out
give
me
another
bowl
of
this
and
tell
me
thy
name
that
i
may
give
thee
gifts
for
bringing
me
this
drink
i
spoke
to
him
guilefully
and
said
noman
is
my
name
noman
my
father
and
my
mother
call
me
give
me
more
of
the
drink
noman
he
shouted
and
the
gift
that
i
shall
give
to
thee
is
that
i
shall
make
thee
the
last
of
thy
fellows
to
be
eaten
gave
him
wine
again
and
when
he
had
taken
the
third
bowl
he
sank
backwards
with
his
face
upturned
and
sleep
came
upon
him
then
i
with
four
companions
took
that
beam
of
olive
wood
now
made
into
a
hard
and
pointed
stake
and
thrust
it
into
the
ashes
of
the
fire
when
the
pointed
end
began
to
glow
we
drew
it
out
of
the
flame
then
i
and
my
companions
laid
hold
on
the
great
stake
and
dashing
at
the
cyclops
thrust
it
into
his
eye
he
raised
a
terrible
cry
that
made
the
rocks
ring
and
we
dashed
away
into
the
recesses
of
the
cave
his
cries
brought
other
cycl√¥pes
to
the
mouth
of
the
cave
and
they
naming
him
as
polyphemus
called
out
and
asked
him
what
ailed
him
to
cry
noman
he
shrieked
out
noman
is
slaying
me
by
guile
they
answered
him
saying
if
no
man
is
slaying
thee
there
is
nothing
we
can
do
for
thee
polyphemus
what
ails
thee
has
been
sent
to
thee
by
the
gods
saying
this
they
went
away
from
the
mouth
of
the
cave
without
attempting
to
move
away
the
stone
then
groaning
with
pain
rolled
away
the
stone
and
sat
before
the
mouth
of
the
cave
with
his
hands
outstretched
thinking
that
he
would
catch
us
as
we
dashed
out
i
showed
my
companions
how
we
might
pass
by
him
i
laid
hands
on
certain
rams
of
the
flock
and
i
lashed
three
of
them
together
with
supple
rods
then
on
the
middle
ram
i
put
a
man
of
my
company
thus
every
three
rams
carried
a
man
as
soon
as
the
dawn
had
come
the
rams
hastened
out
to
the
pasture
and
as
they
passed
polyphemus
laid
hands
on
the
first
and
the
third
of
each
three
that
went
by
they
passed
out
and
polyphemus
did
not
guess
that
a
ram
that
he
did
not
touch
carried
out
a
man
myself
i
took
a
ram
that
was
the
strongest
and
fleeciest
of
the
whole
flock
and
i
placed
myself
under
him
clinging
to
the
wool
of
his
belly
as
this
ram
the
best
of
all
his
flock
went
by
polyphemus
laying
his
hands
upon
him
said
would
that
you
the
best
of
my
flock
were
endowed
with
speech
so
that
you
might
tell
me
where
noman
who
has
blinded
me
has
hidden
himself
the
ram
went
by
him
and
when
he
had
gone
a
little
way
from
the
cave
i
loosed
myself
from
him
and
went
and
set
my
companions
free
gathered
together
many
of
polyphemus
sheep
and
we
drove
them
down
to
our
ship
the
men
we
had
left
behind
would
have
wept
when
they
heard
what
had
happened
to
six
of
their
companions
but
i
bade
them
take
on
board
the
sheep
we
had
brought
and
pull
the
ship
away
from
that
land
then
when
we
had
drawn
a
certain
distance
from
the
shore
i
could
not
forbear
to
shout
my
taunts
into
the
cave
of
polyphemus
cyclops
i
cried
you
thought
that
you
had
the
company
of
a
fool
and
a
weakling
to
eat
but
you
have
been
worsted
by
me
and
your
evil
deeds
have
been
punished
i
shouted
and
polyphemus
came
to
the
mouth
of
the
cave
with
great
anger
in
his
heart
he
took
up
rocks
and
cast
them
at
the
ship
and
they
fell
before
the
prow
the
men
bent
to
the
oars
and
pulled
the
ship
away
or
it
would
have
been
broken
by
the
rocks
he
cast
and
when
we
were
further
away
i
shouted
to
him
cyclops
if
any
man
should
ask
who
it
was
set
his
mark
upon
you
say
that
he
was
odysseus
the
son
of
laertes
illustration
i
heard
polyphemus
cry
out
i
call
upon
poseidon
the
god
of
the
sea
whose
son
i
am
to
avenge
me
upon
you
odysseus
i
call
upon
poseidon
to
grant
that
you
odysseus
may
never
come
to
your
home
or
if
the
gods
have
ordained
your
return
that
you
come
to
it
after
much
toil
and
suffering
in
an
evil
plight
and
in
a
stranger
ship
to
find
sorrow
in
your
home
polyphemus
prayed
and
to
my
evil
fortune
poseidon
heard
his
prayer
but
we
went
on
in
our
ship
rejoicing
at
our
escape
we
came
to
the
waste
island
where
my
other
ships
were
all
the
company
rejoiced
to
see
us
although
they
had
to
mourn
for
their
six
companions
slain
by
polyphemus
we
divided
amongst
the
ships
the
sheep
we
had
taken
from
polyphemus
flock
and
we
sacrificed
to
the
gods
at
the
dawn
of
the
next
day
we
raised
the
sails
on
each
ship
and
we
sailed
away
v
we
came
to
the
island
where
√¶olus
the
lord
of
the
winds
he
who
can
give
mariners
a
good
or
a
bad
wind
has
his
dwelling
with
his
six
sons
and
his
six
daughters
√¶olus
lives
on
a
floating
island
that
has
all
around
it
a
wall
of
bronze
and
when
we
came
to
his
island
the
lord
of
the
winds
treated
us
kindly
and
kept
us
at
his
dwelling
for
a
month
now
when
the
time
came
for
us
to
leave
√¶olus
did
not
try
to
hold
us
on
the
island
and
to
me
when
i
was
going
down
to
the
ships
he
gave
a
bag
made
from
the
hide
of
an
ox
and
in
that
bag
were
all
the
winds
that
blow
he
made
the
mouth
of
the
bag
fast
with
a
silver
thong
so
that
no
wind
that
might
drive
us
from
our
course
could
escape
then
he
sent
the
west
wind
to
blow
on
our
sails
that
we
might
reach
our
own
land
as
quickly
as
a
ship
might
go
nine
days
we
sailed
with
the
west
wind
driving
us
and
on
the
tenth
day
we
came
in
sight
of
ithaka
our
own
land
we
saw
its
coast
and
the
beacon
fires
upon
the
coast
and
the
people
tending
the
fires
then
i
thought
that
the
curse
of
the
cyclops
was
vain
and
could
bring
no
harm
to
us
sleep
that
i
had
kept
from
me
for
long
i
let
weigh
me
down
and
i
no
longer
kept
watch
even
as
i
slept
the
misfortune
that
i
had
watched
against
fell
upon
me
for
now
my
men
spoke
together
and
said
there
is
our
native
land
and
we
come
back
to
it
after
ten
years
struggles
and
toils
with
empty
hands
different
it
is
with
our
lord
odysseus
he
brings
gold
and
silver
from
priam
in
troy
and
√¶olus
too
has
given
him
a
treasure
in
an
bag
but
let
us
take
something
out
of
that
bag
while
he
sleeps
they
spoke
and
they
unloosed
the
mouth
of
the
bag
and
behold
all
the
winds
that
were
tied
in
it
burst
out
then
the
winds
drove
our
ship
towards
the
high
seas
and
away
from
our
land
what
became
of
the
other
ships
i
know
not
i
awoke
and
i
found
that
we
were
being
driven
here
and
there
by
the
winds
i
did
not
know
whether
i
should
spring
into
the
sea
and
so
end
all
my
troubles
or
whether
i
should
endure
this
terrible
misfortune
i
muffled
my
head
in
my
cloak
and
lay
on
the
deck
of
my
ship
winds
brought
us
back
again
to
the
floating
island
we
landed
and
i
went
to
the
dwelling
of
the
lord
of
the
winds
i
sat
by
the
pillars
of
his
threshold
and
he
came
out
and
spoke
to
me
how
now
odysseus
said
he
how
is
it
thou
hast
returned
so
soon
did
i
not
give
thee
a
fair
wind
to
take
thee
to
thine
own
country
and
did
i
not
tie
up
all
the
winds
that
might
be
contrary
to
thee
my
evil
companions
i
said
have
been
my
bane
they
have
undone
all
the
good
that
thou
didst
for
me
o
king
of
the
winds
they
opened
the
bag
and
let
all
the
winds
fly
out
and
now
help
me
o
lord
√¶olus
once
again
√¶olus
said
to
me
far
be
it
from
me
to
help
such
a
man
as
thou
a
man
surely
accursed
by
the
gods
go
from
my
island
for
nothing
will
i
do
for
thee
then
i
went
from
his
dwelling
and
took
my
way
down
to
the
ship
we
sailed
away
from
the
island
of
√¶olus
with
heavy
hearts
next
we
came
to
the
√¶ean
island
where
we
met
with
circe
the
enchantress
for
two
days
and
two
nights
we
were
on
that
island
without
seeing
the
sign
of
a
habitation
on
the
third
day
i
saw
smoke
rising
up
from
some
hearth
i
spoke
of
it
to
my
men
and
it
seemed
good
to
us
that
part
of
our
company
should
go
to
see
were
there
people
there
who
might
help
us
we
drew
lots
to
find
out
who
should
go
and
it
fell
to
the
lot
of
eurylochus
to
go
with
part
of
the
company
while
i
remained
with
the
other
part
eurylochus
went
with
two
and
twenty
men
in
the
forest
glades
they
came
upon
a
house
built
of
polished
stones
all
round
that
house
wild
beasts
roamed
wolves
and
lions
but
these
beasts
were
not
fierce
as
eurylochus
and
his
men
went
towards
the
house
the
lions
and
wolves
fawned
upon
them
like
house
dogs
the
men
were
affrighted
and
stood
round
the
outer
gate
of
the
court
they
heard
a
voice
within
the
house
singing
and
it
seemed
to
them
to
be
the
voice
of
a
woman
singing
as
she
went
to
and
fro
before
a
web
she
was
weaving
on
a
loom
the
men
shouted
and
she
who
had
been
singing
opened
the
polished
doors
and
came
out
of
the
dwelling
she
was
very
fair
to
see
as
she
opened
the
doors
of
the
house
she
asked
the
men
to
come
within
and
they
went
into
her
halls
illustration
eurylochus
tarried
behind
he
watched
the
woman
and
he
saw
her
give
food
to
the
men
but
he
saw
that
she
mixed
a
drug
with
what
she
gave
them
to
eat
and
with
the
wine
she
gave
them
to
drink
no
sooner
had
they
eaten
the
food
and
drunk
the
wine
than
she
struck
them
with
a
wand
and
behold
the
men
turned
into
swine
then
the
woman
drove
them
out
of
the
house
and
put
them
in
the
and
gave
them
acorns
and
mast
and
the
fruit
of
the
cornel
tree
to
eat
when
he
saw
these
happenings
ran
back
through
the
forest
and
told
me
all
then
i
cast
about
my
shoulder
my
good
sword
of
bronze
and
bidding
eurylochus
stay
by
the
ships
i
went
through
the
forest
and
came
to
the
house
of
the
enchantress
i
stood
at
the
outer
court
and
called
out
then
circe
the
enchantress
flung
wide
the
shining
doors
and
called
to
me
to
come
within
i
entered
her
dwelling
and
she
brought
me
to
a
chair
and
put
a
footstool
under
my
feet
then
she
brought
me
in
a
golden
cup
the
wine
into
which
she
had
cast
a
harmful
drug
she
handed
me
the
cup
i
drew
my
sword
and
sprang
at
her
as
one
eager
to
slay
her
she
shrank
back
from
me
and
cried
out
who
art
thou
who
art
able
to
guess
at
my
enchantments
verily
thou
art
odysseus
of
whom
hermes
told
me
nay
put
up
thy
sword
and
let
us
two
be
friendly
to
each
other
in
all
things
i
will
treat
thee
kindly
i
said
to
her
nay
circe
you
must
swear
to
me
first
that
thou
wilt
not
treat
me
guilefully
illustration
swore
by
the
gods
that
she
would
not
treat
me
guilefully
and
i
put
up
my
sword
then
the
handmaidens
of
circe
prepared
a
bath
and
i
bathed
and
rubbed
myself
with
olive
oil
and
circe
gave
me
a
new
mantle
and
doublet
the
handmaidens
brought
out
silver
tables
and
on
them
set
golden
baskets
with
bread
and
meat
in
them
and
others
brought
cups
of
wine
i
sat
before
a
silver
table
but
i
had
no
pleasure
in
the
food
before
me
circe
saw
me
sitting
silent
and
troubled
she
said
why
odysseus
dost
thou
sit
like
a
speechless
man
dost
thou
think
there
is
a
drug
in
this
food
but
i
have
sworn
that
i
will
not
treat
thee
guilefully
and
that
oath
i
shall
keep
i
said
to
her
o
circe
enchantress
what
man
of
good
heart
could
take
meat
and
drink
while
his
companions
are
as
swine
in
if
thou
wouldst
have
me
eat
and
drink
first
let
me
see
my
companions
in
their
own
forms
when
she
heard
me
say
this
went
to
the
and
anointed
each
of
the
swine
that
was
there
with
a
charm
as
she
did
the
bristles
dropped
away
and
the
limbs
of
the
man
were
seen
my
companions
became
men
again
and
were
even
taller
and
handsomer
than
they
had
been
before
that
we
lived
on
circe
island
in
friendship
with
the
enchantress
she
did
not
treat
us
guilefully
again
and
we
feasted
in
her
house
for
a
year
in
all
of
us
there
was
a
longing
to
return
to
our
own
land
and
my
men
came
to
me
and
craved
that
i
should
ask
circe
to
let
us
go
on
our
homeward
way
she
gave
us
leave
to
go
and
she
told
us
of
the
many
dangers
we
should
meet
on
our
voyage
vi
when
the
sun
sank
and
darkness
came
on
my
men
went
to
lie
by
the
hawsers
of
the
ship
then
circe
the
enchantress
took
my
hand
and
making
me
sit
down
by
her
told
me
of
the
voyage
that
was
before
us
to
the
sirens
first
you
shall
come
said
she
to
the
sirens
who
sit
in
their
field
of
flowers
and
bewitch
all
men
who
come
near
them
he
who
comes
near
the
sirens
without
knowing
their
ways
and
hears
the
sound
of
their
voices
never
again
shall
that
man
see
wife
or
child
or
have
joy
of
his
all
round
where
the
sirens
sit
are
great
heaps
of
the
bones
of
men
but
i
will
tell
thee
odysseus
how
thou
mayst
pass
them
when
thou
comest
near
put
wax
over
the
ears
of
thy
company
lest
any
of
them
hear
the
sirens
song
but
if
thou
thyself
art
minded
to
hear
let
thy
company
bind
thee
hand
and
foot
to
the
mast
and
if
thou
shalt
beseech
them
to
loose
thee
then
must
they
bind
thee
with
tighter
bonds
when
thy
companions
have
driven
the
ship
past
where
the
sirens
sing
then
thou
canst
be
unbound
past
where
the
sirens
sit
there
is
a
dangerous
place
indeed
on
one
side
there
are
great
rocks
which
the
gods
call
the
rocks
wandering
no
ship
ever
escapes
that
goes
that
way
and
round
these
rocks
the
planks
of
ships
and
the
bodies
of
men
are
tossed
by
waves
of
the
sea
and
storms
of
fire
one
ship
only
ever
passed
that
way
jason
ship
the
argo
and
that
ship
would
have
been
broken
on
the
rocks
if
hera
the
goddess
had
not
helped
it
to
pass
because
of
her
love
for
the
hero
jason
on
the
other
side
of
the
rocks
wandering
are
two
peaks
through
which
thou
wilt
have
to
take
thy
ship
one
peak
is
smooth
and
sheer
and
goes
up
to
the
clouds
of
heaven
in
the
middle
of
it
there
is
a
cave
and
that
cave
is
the
den
of
a
monster
named
scylla
this
monster
has
six
necks
and
on
each
neck
there
is
a
hideous
head
she
holds
her
heads
over
the
gulf
seeking
for
prey
and
yelping
horribly
no
ship
has
ever
passed
that
way
without
scylla
seizing
and
carrying
off
in
each
mouth
of
her
six
heads
the
body
of
a
man
the
other
peak
is
near
thou
couldst
send
an
arrow
across
to
it
from
scylla
den
out
of
the
peak
a
fig
tree
grows
and
below
that
fig
tree
charybdis
has
her
den
she
sits
there
sucking
down
the
water
and
spouting
it
forth
mayst
thou
not
be
near
when
she
sucks
the
water
down
for
then
nothing
could
save
thee
keep
nearer
to
scylla
than
to
charybdis
rock
it
is
better
to
lose
six
of
your
company
than
to
lose
thy
ship
and
all
thy
company
keep
near
scylla
rock
and
drive
right
on
if
thou
shouldst
win
past
the
deadly
rocks
guarded
by
scylla
and
charybdis
thou
wilt
come
to
the
island
of
thrinacia
there
the
cattle
of
the
sun
graze
with
immortal
nymphs
to
guard
them
if
them
comest
to
that
island
do
no
hurt
to
those
herds
if
thou
doest
hurt
to
them
i
foresee
ruin
for
thy
ship
and
thy
men
even
though
thou
thyself
shouldst
escape
circe
spoke
to
me
and
having
told
me
such
things
she
took
her
way
up
the
island
then
i
went
to
the
ship
and
roused
my
men
speedily
they
went
aboard
and
having
taken
their
seats
upon
the
benches
struck
the
water
with
their
oars
then
the
sails
were
hoisted
and
a
breeze
came
and
we
sailed
away
from
the
isle
of
circe
the
enchantress
told
my
companions
what
circe
had
told
me
about
the
sirens
in
their
field
of
flowers
i
took
a
great
piece
of
wax
and
broke
it
and
kneaded
it
until
it
was
soft
then
i
covered
the
ears
of
my
men
and
they
bound
me
upright
to
the
mast
of
the
ship
the
wind
dropped
and
the
sea
became
calm
as
though
a
god
had
stilled
the
waters
my
company
took
their
oars
and
pulled
away
when
the
ship
was
within
a
man
shout
from
the
land
we
had
come
near
the
sirens
espied
us
and
raised
their
song
come
hither
come
hither
o
odysseus
the
sirens
sang
stay
thy
bark
and
listen
to
our
song
none
hath
ever
gone
this
way
in
his
ship
until
he
hath
heard
from
our
own
lips
the
voice
sweet
as
a
honeycomb
and
hath
joy
of
it
and
gone
on
his
way
a
wiser
man
we
know
all
things
all
the
travail
the
greeks
had
in
the
war
of
troy
and
we
know
all
that
hereafter
shall
be
upon
the
earth
odysseus
odysseus
come
to
our
field
of
flowers
and
hear
the
song
that
we
shall
sing
to
thee
illustration
heart
was
mad
to
listen
to
the
sirens
i
nodded
my
head
to
the
company
commanding
them
to
unloose
me
but
they
bound
me
the
tighter
and
bent
to
their
oars
and
rowed
on
when
we
had
gone
past
the
place
of
the
sirens
the
men
took
the
wax
from
off
their
ears
and
loosed
me
from
the
mast
but
no
sooner
had
we
passed
the
island
than
i
saw
smoke
arising
and
heard
the
roaring
of
the
sea
my
company
threw
down
their
oars
in
terror
i
went
amongst
them
to
hearten
them
and
i
made
them
remember
how
by
my
device
we
had
escaped
from
the
cave
of
the
cyclops
i
told
them
nothing
of
the
monster
scylla
lest
the
fear
of
her
should
break
their
hearts
and
now
we
began
to
drive
through
that
narrow
strait
on
one
side
was
scylla
and
on
the
other
charybdis
fear
gripped
the
men
when
they
saw
charybdis
gulping
down
the
sea
but
as
we
drove
by
the
monster
scylla
seized
six
of
my
company
the
hardiest
of
the
men
who
were
with
me
as
they
were
lifted
up
in
the
mouths
of
her
six
heads
they
called
to
me
in
their
agony
i
could
do
nothing
to
aid
them
they
were
carried
up
to
be
devoured
in
the
monster
den
of
all
the
sights
i
have
seen
on
the
ways
of
the
water
that
sight
was
the
most
pitiful
illustration
passed
the
rocks
of
scylla
and
charybdis
we
came
to
the
island
of
thrinacia
while
we
were
yet
on
the
ship
i
heard
the
lowing
of
the
cattle
of
the
sun
i
spoke
to
my
company
and
told
them
that
we
should
drive
past
that
island
and
not
venture
to
go
upon
it
hearts
of
my
men
were
broken
within
them
at
that
sentence
and
eurylochus
answered
me
speaking
sadly
it
is
easy
for
thee
o
odysseus
to
speak
like
that
for
thou
art
never
weary
and
thou
hast
strength
beyond
measure
but
is
thy
heart
too
of
iron
that
thou
wilt
not
suffer
thy
companions
to
set
foot
upon
shore
where
they
may
rest
themselves
from
the
sea
and
prepare
their
supper
at
their
ease
eurylochus
spoke
and
the
rest
of
the
company
joined
in
what
he
said
their
force
was
greater
than
mine
then
said
i
swear
to
me
a
mighty
oath
one
and
all
of
you
that
if
we
go
upon
this
island
none
of
you
will
slay
the
cattle
out
of
any
herd
swore
the
oath
that
i
gave
them
we
brought
our
ship
to
a
harbour
and
landed
near
a
spring
of
fresh
water
and
the
men
got
their
supper
ready
having
eaten
their
supper
they
fell
to
weeping
for
they
thought
upon
their
comrades
that
scylla
had
devoured
then
they
slept
dawn
came
but
we
found
that
we
could
not
take
our
ship
out
of
the
harbour
for
the
north
wind
and
the
east
wind
blew
a
hurricane
so
we
stayed
upon
the
island
and
the
days
and
the
weeks
went
by
when
the
corn
we
had
brought
in
the
ship
was
all
eaten
the
men
went
through
the
island
fishing
and
hunting
little
they
got
to
stay
their
hunger
day
while
i
slept
eurylochus
gave
the
men
a
most
evil
counsel
every
death
he
said
is
hateful
to
man
but
death
by
hunger
is
far
the
worst
rather
than
die
of
hunger
let
us
drive
off
the
best
cattle
from
the
herds
of
the
sun
then
if
the
gods
would
wreck
us
on
the
sea
for
the
deed
let
them
do
it
i
would
rather
perish
on
the
waves
than
die
in
the
pangs
of
hunger
he
spoke
and
the
rest
of
the
men
approved
of
what
he
said
they
slaughtered
them
and
roasted
their
flesh
it
was
then
that
i
awakened
from
my
sleep
as
i
came
down
to
the
ship
the
smell
of
the
roasting
flesh
came
to
me
then
i
knew
that
a
terrible
deed
had
been
committed
and
that
a
dreadful
thing
would
befall
all
of
us
six
days
my
company
feasted
on
the
best
of
the
cattle
on
the
seventh
day
the
winds
ceased
to
blow
then
we
went
to
the
ship
and
set
up
the
mast
and
the
sails
and
fared
out
again
on
the
deep
having
left
that
island
no
other
land
appeared
and
only
sky
and
sea
were
to
be
seen
a
cloud
stayed
always
above
our
ship
and
beneath
that
cloud
the
sea
was
darkened
the
west
wind
came
in
a
rush
and
the
mast
broke
and
in
breaking
struck
off
the
head
of
the
pilot
and
he
fell
straight
down
into
the
sea
a
thunderbolt
struck
the
ship
and
the
men
were
swept
from
the
deck
never
a
man
of
my
company
did
i
see
again
west
wind
ceased
to
blow
but
the
south
wind
came
and
it
drove
the
ship
back
on
its
course
it
rushed
towards
the
terrible
rocks
of
scylla
and
charybdis
all
night
long
i
was
borne
on
and
at
the
rising
of
the
sun
i
found
myself
near
charybdis
my
ship
was
sucked
down
but
i
caught
the
branches
of
the
fig
tree
that
grew
out
of
the
rock
and
hung
to
it
like
a
bat
there
i
stayed
until
the
timbers
of
my
ship
were
cast
up
again
by
charybdis
i
dropped
down
on
them
sitting
on
the
boards
i
rowed
with
my
hands
and
passed
the
rock
of
scylla
without
the
monster
seeing
me
for
nine
days
i
was
borne
along
by
the
waves
and
on
the
tenth
day
i
came
to
ogygia
where
the
nymph
calypso
dwells
she
took
me
to
her
dwelling
and
treated
me
kindly
but
why
tell
the
remainder
of
my
toils
to
thee
o
king
and
to
thy
noble
wife
i
told
how
i
came
from
island
and
i
am
not
one
to
repeat
a
tale
vii
odysseus
finished
and
the
company
in
the
hall
sat
silent
like
men
enchanted
then
king
alcinous
spoke
and
said
as
far
as
we
ph√¶acians
are
concerned
wilt
thou
odysseus
be
driven
from
thy
homeward
way
we
will
give
thee
a
ship
and
an
escort
and
we
will
land
thee
in
ithaka
thine
own
country
the
princes
captains
and
councillors
marvelling
that
they
had
met
the
renowned
odysseus
went
each
to
his
own
home
when
the
dawn
had
come
each
carried
down
to
the
ship
on
which
odysseus
was
to
sail
gifts
for
him
illustration
when
the
sun
was
near
its
setting
they
all
came
back
to
the
king
hall
to
take
farewell
of
him
the
king
poured
out
a
great
bowl
of
wine
as
an
offering
to
the
gods
then
odysseus
rose
up
and
placed
in
the
hands
a
cup
and
he
said
to
thee
o
queen
mayst
thou
long
rejoice
in
thy
house
and
thy
children
and
in
thy
husband
alcinous
the
renowned
king
he
passed
over
the
threshold
of
the
king
house
and
he
went
down
to
the
ship
he
went
aboard
and
lay
down
on
the
deck
on
a
sheet
and
rug
that
had
been
spread
for
him
straightway
the
mariners
took
to
their
oars
and
hoisted
their
sails
and
the
ship
sped
on
like
a
strong
odysseus
slept
and
lightly
the
ship
sped
on
bearing
that
man
who
had
suffered
so
much
sorrow
of
heart
in
passing
through
wars
of
men
and
through
troublous
seas
the
ship
sped
on
and
he
slept
and
was
forgetful
of
all
he
had
passed
through
when
the
dawn
came
the
ship
was
near
to
the
island
of
ithaka
the
mariners
drove
to
a
harbour
near
which
there
was
a
great
cave
they
ran
the
ship
ashore
and
lifted
out
odysseus
wrapped
in
the
sheet
and
the
rugs
and
still
sleeping
they
left
him
on
the
sandy
shore
of
his
own
land
then
they
took
the
gifts
which
the
king
and
queen
the
princes
captains
and
councillors
of
the
ph√¶acians
had
given
him
and
they
set
them
by
an
olive
tree
a
little
apart
from
the
road
so
that
no
wandering
person
might
come
upon
them
before
odysseus
had
awakened
then
they
went
back
to
their
ship
and
departed
from
ithaka
for
their
own
land
odysseus
awakened
on
the
beach
of
his
own
land
a
mist
lay
over
all
and
he
did
not
know
what
land
he
had
come
to
he
thought
that
the
ph√¶acians
had
left
him
forsaken
on
a
strange
shore
as
he
looked
around
him
in
his
bewilderment
he
saw
one
who
was
like
a
king
son
approaching
now
the
one
who
came
near
him
was
not
a
young
man
but
the
goddess
pallas
athene
who
had
made
herself
look
like
a
young
man
odysseus
arose
and
questioned
her
as
to
the
land
he
had
come
to
the
goddess
answered
him
and
said
is
ithaka
a
land
good
for
goats
and
cattle
a
land
of
woods
and
wells
even
as
she
spoke
she
changed
from
the
semblance
of
a
young
man
and
was
seen
by
odysseus
as
a
woman
tall
and
fair
thou
not
know
me
pallas
athene
the
daughter
of
zeus
who
has
always
helped
thee
the
goddess
said
would
have
been
more
often
by
thy
side
only
i
did
not
want
to
go
openly
against
my
brother
poseidon
the
god
of
the
sea
whose
son
polyphemus
thou
didst
blind
as
the
goddess
spoke
the
mist
that
lay
on
the
land
scattered
and
odysseus
saw
that
he
was
indeed
in
ithaka
his
own
country
he
knew
the
harbour
and
the
cave
and
the
hill
neriton
all
covered
with
its
forest
and
knowing
them
he
knelt
down
on
the
ground
and
kissed
the
earth
of
his
country
illustration
then
the
goddess
helped
him
to
lay
his
goods
within
the
cave
the
gold
and
the
bronze
and
the
woven
raiment
that
the
ph√¶acians
had
given
him
she
made
him
sit
beside
her
under
the
olive
tree
while
she
told
him
of
the
things
that
were
happening
in
his
house
is
trouble
in
thy
halls
odysseus
she
said
it
would
be
well
for
thee
not
to
make
thyself
known
for
a
time
harden
thy
heart
that
thou
mayest
endure
for
a
while
longer
ill
treatment
at
the
hands
of
men
she
told
him
about
the
wooers
of
his
wife
who
filled
his
halls
all
day
and
wasted
his
substance
and
who
would
slay
him
lest
he
should
punish
them
for
their
insolence
that
the
doom
of
agamemnon
shall
not
befall
thee
thy
slaying
within
thine
own
halls
i
will
change
thine
appearance
that
no
man
shall
know
thee
the
goddess
said
then
she
made
a
change
in
his
appearance
that
would
have
been
evil
but
that
it
was
to
last
for
a
while
only
she
made
his
skin
wither
and
she
dimmed
his
shining
eyes
she
made
his
yellow
hair
grey
and
scanty
then
she
changed
his
raiment
to
a
beggar
wrap
torn
and
stained
with
smoke
over
his
shoulder
she
cast
the
hide
of
a
deer
and
she
put
into
his
hands
a
beggar
staff
with
a
tattered
bag
and
a
cord
to
hang
it
by
and
when
she
had
made
this
change
in
his
appearance
the
goddess
left
odysseus
and
went
from
ithaka
it
was
then
that
she
came
to
telemachus
in
sparta
and
counselled
him
to
leave
the
house
of
menelaus
and
helen
and
it
has
been
told
how
he
went
with
peisistratus
the
son
of
nestor
and
came
to
his
own
ship
his
ship
was
hailed
by
a
man
who
was
flying
from
those
who
would
slay
him
and
this
man
telemachus
took
aboard
the
stranger
name
was
theoclymenus
and
he
was
a
and
a
man
and
telemachus
returning
to
ithaka
was
in
peril
of
his
life
the
wooers
of
his
mother
had
discovered
that
he
had
gone
from
ithaka
in
a
ship
two
of
the
wooers
antinous
and
eurymachus
were
greatly
angered
at
the
daring
act
of
the
youth
has
gone
to
sparta
for
help
antinous
said
if
he
finds
that
there
are
those
who
will
help
him
we
will
not
be
able
to
stand
against
his
pride
he
will
make
us
suffer
for
what
we
have
wasted
in
his
house
but
let
us
too
act
i
will
take
a
ship
with
twenty
men
and
lie
in
wait
for
him
in
a
strait
between
ithaka
and
samos
and
put
an
end
to
his
search
for
his
father
thereupon
antinous
took
twenty
men
to
a
ship
and
fixing
mast
and
sails
they
went
over
the
sea
there
is
a
little
isle
between
ithaka
and
samos
asteris
it
is
called
and
in
the
harbour
of
that
isle
he
and
his
men
lay
in
wait
for
telemachus
viii
near
the
place
where
odysseus
had
landed
there
lived
an
old
man
who
was
a
faithful
servant
in
his
house
eum√¶us
was
his
name
and
he
was
a
swineherd
he
had
made
for
himself
a
dwelling
in
the
wildest
part
of
the
island
and
had
built
a
wall
round
it
and
had
made
for
the
swine
pens
in
the
courtyard
twelve
pens
and
in
each
pen
there
were
fifty
swine
old
eum√¶us
lived
in
this
place
tending
the
swine
with
three
young
men
to
help
him
the
were
guarded
by
four
dogs
that
were
as
fierce
as
the
beasts
of
the
forest
as
he
came
near
the
dogs
dashed
at
him
yelping
and
snapping
and
odysseus
might
have
suffered
foul
hurt
if
the
swineherd
had
not
run
out
of
the
courtyard
and
driven
the
fierce
dogs
away
seeing
before
him
one
who
looked
an
ancient
beggar
eum√¶us
said
man
it
is
well
that
my
dogs
did
not
tear
thee
for
they
might
have
brought
upon
me
the
shame
of
thy
death
i
have
grief
and
pains
enough
the
gods
know
without
such
a
happening
here
i
sit
mourning
for
my
noble
master
and
fattening
hogs
for
others
to
eat
while
he
mayhap
is
wandering
in
hunger
through
some
friendless
city
but
come
in
old
man
i
have
bread
and
wine
to
give
thee
the
swineherd
led
the
seeming
beggar
into
the
courtyard
and
he
let
him
sit
down
on
a
heap
of
brushwood
and
spread
for
him
a
shaggy
odysseus
was
glad
of
his
servant
welcome
and
he
said
zeus
and
all
the
other
gods
grant
thee
thy
heart
dearest
wish
for
the
welcome
that
thou
hast
given
to
me
said
eum√¶us
the
swineherd
good
man
looks
on
all
strangers
and
beggars
as
being
from
zeus
himself
and
my
heart
dearest
wish
is
that
my
master
odysseus
should
return
ah
if
odysseus
were
here
he
would
give
me
something
which
i
could
hold
as
mine
own
a
piece
of
ground
to
till
and
a
wife
to
comfort
me
but
my
master
will
not
return
and
we
thralls
must
go
in
fear
when
young
lords
come
to
rule
it
over
them
he
went
to
the
and
brought
out
two
sucking
pigs
he
slaughtered
them
and
cut
them
small
and
roasted
the
meat
when
all
was
cooked
he
brought
portions
to
odysseus
sprinkled
with
barley
meal
and
he
brought
him
too
wine
in
a
deep
bowl
of
ivy
wood
and
when
odysseus
had
eaten
and
drunken
eum√¶us
the
swineherd
said
to
him
man
no
wanderer
ever
comes
to
this
land
but
that
our
lady
penelope
sends
for
him
and
gives
him
entertainment
hoping
that
he
will
have
something
to
tell
her
of
her
lord
odysseus
they
all
do
as
thou
wouldst
do
if
thou
earnest
to
her
tell
her
a
tale
of
having
seen
or
of
having
heard
of
her
lord
to
win
her
ear
but
as
for
odysseus
no
matter
what
wanderers
or
vagrants
say
he
will
never
return
dogs
or
wild
birds
or
the
fishes
of
the
deep
have
devoured
his
body
ere
this
never
again
shall
i
find
so
good
a
lord
nor
would
i
find
one
so
kind
even
if
i
were
back
in
my
own
land
and
saw
the
faces
of
my
father
and
my
mother
but
not
so
much
for
them
do
i
mourn
as
for
the
loss
of
my
master
said
odysseus
sayst
that
thy
master
will
never
return
but
i
notice
that
thou
art
slow
to
believe
thine
own
words
now
i
tell
thee
that
odysseus
will
return
and
in
this
same
year
and
as
sure
as
the
old
moon
wanes
and
the
young
moon
is
born
he
will
take
vengeance
on
those
whom
you
have
spoken
of
those
who
eat
his
substance
and
dishonour
his
wife
and
son
i
say
that
and
i
swear
it
with
an
oath
illustration
do
not
heed
thine
oath
said
eum√¶us
the
swineherd
do
not
listen
to
vagrant
tales
about
my
master
since
a
stranger
came
here
and
cheated
us
with
a
story
he
told
us
that
he
had
seen
odysseus
in
the
land
of
the
cretans
in
the
house
of
the
hero
idomeneus
mending
his
ships
that
had
been
broken
by
the
storm
and
that
he
would
be
here
by
summer
or
by
harvest
time
bringing
with
him
much
wealth
as
they
were
speaking
the
younger
swineherds
came
back
from
the
woods
bringing
the
drove
of
swine
into
the
courtyard
there
was
a
mighty
din
whilst
the
swine
were
being
put
into
their
pens
supper
time
came
on
and
eum√¶us
and
odysseus
and
the
younger
swineherds
sat
down
to
a
meal
eum√¶us
carved
the
swineflesh
giving
the
best
portion
to
odysseus
whom
he
treated
as
the
guest
of
honour
and
odysseus
said
surely
thou
art
counselled
by
zeus
seeing
thou
dost
give
the
best
of
the
meat
even
to
such
a
one
as
i
and
eum√¶us
thinking
odysseus
was
praising
him
for
treating
a
stranger
kindly
said
stranger
and
make
merry
with
such
fare
as
is
here
the
night
came
on
cold
with
rain
then
odysseus
to
test
the
kindliness
of
the
swineherd
said
that
i
were
young
and
could
endure
this
bitter
night
o
that
i
were
better
off
then
would
one
of
you
swineherds
give
me
a
wrap
to
cover
myself
from
the
wind
and
rain
but
now
verily
i
am
an
outcast
because
of
my
sorry
raiment
then
eum√¶us
sprang
up
and
made
a
bed
for
odysseus
near
the
fire
odysseus
lay
down
and
the
swineherd
covered
him
with
a
mantle
he
kept
for
a
covering
when
great
storms
should
arise
then
that
he
might
better
guard
the
swine
eum√¶us
wrapping
himself
up
in
a
cloak
and
taking
with
him
a
sword
and
javelin
to
drive
off
wild
beasts
should
they
come
near
went
to
lie
nearer
to
the
pens
when
morning
came
odysseus
said
am
going
to
the
town
to
beg
so
that
i
need
take
nothing
more
from
thee
send
someone
with
me
to
be
a
guide
i
would
go
to
the
house
of
odysseus
and
see
if
i
can
earn
a
little
from
the
wooers
who
are
there
right
well
could
i
serve
them
if
they
would
take
me
on
there
could
be
no
better
than
i
when
it
comes
to
splitting
faggots
and
kindling
a
fire
and
carving
meat
nay
said
eum√¶us
not
go
there
stranger
none
here
are
at
a
loss
by
thy
presence
stay
until
the
son
of
odysseus
telemachus
returns
and
he
will
do
something
for
thee
go
not
near
the
wooers
it
is
not
such
a
one
as
thee
that
they
would
have
to
serve
them
stay
this
day
with
us
odysseus
did
not
go
to
the
town
but
stayed
all
day
with
eum√¶us
and
at
night
when
he
and
eum√¶us
and
the
younger
swineherds
were
seated
at
the
fire
odysseus
said
too
eum√¶us
hast
wandered
far
and
hast
had
many
sorrows
tell
us
how
thou
earnest
to
be
a
slave
and
a
swineherd
the
story
of
eum√¶us
the
swineherd
is
said
eum√¶us
certain
island
over
against
ortygia
that
island
has
two
cities
and
my
father
was
king
over
them
both
came
to
the
city
where
my
father
dwelt
a
ship
with
merchants
from
the
land
of
the
ph≈ìnicians
i
was
a
child
then
and
there
was
in
my
father
house
a
ph≈ìnician
who
nursed
me
once
when
she
was
washing
clothes
one
of
the
sailors
from
the
ph≈ìnician
ship
spoke
to
her
and
asked
her
would
she
like
to
go
back
with
them
to
their
own
land
spoke
to
that
sailor
and
told
him
her
story
i
am
from
sidon
in
the
ph≈ìnician
land
she
said
and
my
father
was
named
artybas
and
was
famous
for
his
riches
sea
robbers
caught
me
one
day
as
i
was
crossing
the
fields
and
they
stole
me
away
and
brought
me
here
and
sold
me
to
the
master
of
yonder
house
the
sailor
said
to
her
your
father
and
mother
are
still
alive
i
know
and
they
have
lost
none
of
their
wealth
wilt
thou
not
come
with
us
and
see
them
again
the
woman
made
the
sailors
swear
that
they
would
bring
her
safely
to
the
city
of
sidon
she
told
them
that
when
their
ship
was
ready
she
would
come
down
to
it
and
that
she
would
bring
what
gold
she
could
lay
her
hands
on
away
from
her
master
house
and
that
she
would
also
bring
the
child
whom
she
nursed
he
is
a
wise
child
she
said
and
you
can
sell
him
for
a
slave
when
you
come
to
a
foreign
land
the
ph≈ìnician
ship
was
ready
to
depart
they
sent
a
message
to
the
woman
the
sailor
who
brought
the
message
brought
too
a
chain
of
gold
with
amber
beads
strung
here
and
there
for
my
mother
to
buy
and
while
my
mother
and
her
handmaids
were
handling
the
chain
the
sailor
nodded
to
the
woman
and
she
went
out
taking
with
her
three
cups
of
gold
and
leading
me
by
the
hand
sun
sank
and
all
the
ways
were
darkened
but
the
ph≈ìnician
woman
went
down
to
the
harbour
and
came
to
the
ship
and
went
aboard
it
and
when
the
sailor
who
had
gone
to
my
father
house
came
back
they
raised
the
mast
and
sails
and
took
the
oars
in
their
hands
and
drew
the
ship
away
from
our
land
we
sailed
away
and
i
was
left
stricken
at
heart
for
six
days
we
sailed
over
the
sea
and
on
the
seventh
day
the
woman
died
and
her
body
was
cast
into
the
deep
the
wind
and
the
waves
bore
us
to
ithaka
and
there
the
merchants
sold
me
to
laertes
the
father
of
odysseus
wife
of
laertes
reared
me
kindly
and
i
grew
up
with
the
youngest
of
her
daughters
the
lovely
ctimene
but
ctimene
went
to
same
and
was
married
to
one
of
the
princes
of
that
island
afterwards
laertes
lady
sent
me
to
work
in
the
fields
but
always
she
treated
me
kindly
now
laertes
lady
is
dead
she
wasted
away
from
grief
when
she
heard
no
tidings
of
her
only
son
odysseus
laertes
yet
lives
but
since
the
death
of
his
noble
wife
he
never
leaves
his
house
all
day
he
sits
by
his
fire
they
say
and
thinks
upon
his
son
doom
and
how
his
substance
is
being
wasted
and
how
his
son
son
will
have
but
little
to
inherit
so
odysseus
passed
part
of
the
night
eum√¶us
telling
him
of
his
wanderings
and
his
sorrows
and
while
they
were
speaking
telemachus
the
son
of
odysseus
came
to
ithaka
in
his
good
ship
antinous
had
lain
in
wait
for
him
and
had
posted
sentinels
to
watch
for
his
ship
nevertheless
telemachus
had
passed
by
without
being
seen
by
his
enemies
and
having
come
to
ithaka
he
bade
one
of
his
comrades
bring
the
ship
into
the
wharf
of
the
city
while
he
himself
went
to
another
place
leaving
the
ship
he
came
to
the
dwelling
of
the
servant
he
most
trusted
to
the
dwelling
of
eum√¶us
the
swineherd
ix
on
the
morning
of
his
fourth
day
in
ithaka
as
he
and
the
swineherd
were
eating
a
meal
together
odysseus
heard
the
sound
of
footsteps
approaching
the
hut
the
fierce
dogs
were
outside
and
he
expected
to
hear
them
yelping
against
the
stranger
approach
no
sound
came
from
them
then
he
saw
a
young
man
come
to
the
entrance
of
the
courtyard
the
swineherd
dogs
fawning
upon
him
when
eum√¶us
saw
this
young
man
he
let
fall
the
vessels
he
was
carrying
and
running
to
him
kissed
his
head
and
his
eyes
and
his
hands
while
he
was
kissing
and
weeping
over
him
odysseus
heard
the
swineherd
saying
art
thou
come
back
to
us
like
a
light
in
the
darkness
thou
hast
appeared
i
thought
that
never
again
should
we
see
thee
when
i
heard
that
thou
hadst
taken
a
ship
to
pylos
come
in
dear
son
come
in
that
i
may
see
thee
once
again
in
mine
house
odysseus
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
his
son
as
a
lion
might
look
over
his
cub
so
he
looked
over
telemachus
but
neither
the
swineherd
nor
telemachus
was
aware
of
odysseus
gaze
have
come
to
see
thee
friend
eum√¶us
said
telemachus
before
i
go
into
the
city
i
would
know
whether
my
mother
is
still
in
the
house
of
odysseus
or
whether
one
of
the
wooers
has
at
last
taken
her
as
a
wife
to
his
own
house
mother
is
still
in
thy
father
house
eum√¶us
answered
then
telemachus
came
within
the
courtyard
odysseus
in
the
guise
of
the
old
beggar
rose
from
his
seat
but
the
young
man
said
to
him
courteously
seated
friend
another
seat
can
be
found
for
me
illustration
eum√¶us
strewed
green
brushwood
and
spread
a
fleece
upon
it
and
telemachus
seated
himself
next
eum√¶us
fetched
a
meal
for
him
oaten
cakes
and
swine
flesh
and
wine
while
they
were
eating
the
swineherd
said
have
here
a
stranger
who
has
wandered
through
many
countries
and
who
has
come
to
my
house
as
a
suppliant
wilt
thou
take
him
for
thy
man
telemachus
said
telemachus
can
i
support
any
man
i
have
not
the
strength
of
hand
to
defend
mine
own
house
but
for
this
stranger
i
will
do
what
i
can
i
will
give
him
a
mantle
and
doublet
with
shoes
for
his
feet
and
a
sword
to
defend
himself
and
i
will
send
him
on
whatever
way
he
wants
to
go
but
eum√¶us
i
would
not
have
him
go
near
my
father
house
the
wooers
grow
more
insolent
each
day
and
they
might
mock
the
stranger
if
he
went
amongst
them
then
said
odysseus
speaking
for
the
first
time
sir
what
thou
hast
said
seems
strange
to
me
dost
thou
willingly
submit
to
insolence
in
thine
own
father
house
but
perhaps
it
is
that
the
people
of
the
city
hate
thee
and
will
not
help
thee
against
thine
enemies
ah
if
i
had
such
youth
as
i
have
spirit
or
if
i
were
the
son
of
odysseus
i
should
go
amongst
them
this
very
day
and
make
myself
the
bane
of
each
man
of
them
i
would
rather
die
in
mine
own
halls
than
see
such
shame
as
is
reported
strangers
mocked
at
and
servants
injured
and
wine
and
food
wasted
said
telemachus
people
of
the
city
do
not
hate
me
and
they
would
help
me
if
they
could
but
the
wooers
of
my
mother
are
powerful
men
men
to
make
the
city
folk
afraid
and
if
i
should
oppose
them
i
would
assuredly
be
slain
in
my
father
house
for
how
could
i
hope
to
overcome
so
many
wouldst
thou
have
me
do
for
thee
telemachus
said
the
swineherd
would
have
thee
go
to
my
mother
friend
eum√¶us
telemachus
said
let
her
know
that
i
am
from
pylos
eum√¶us
at
once
put
sandals
upon
his
feet
and
took
his
staff
in
his
hands
he
begged
telemachus
to
rest
himself
in
the
hut
and
then
he
left
the
courtyard
and
went
towards
the
city
telemachus
lay
down
on
his
seat
and
closed
his
eyes
in
weariness
he
saw
while
thinking
that
he
only
dreamt
it
a
woman
come
to
the
gate
of
the
courtyard
she
was
fair
and
tall
and
splendid
and
the
dogs
shrank
away
from
her
presence
with
a
whine
she
touched
the
beggar
with
a
golden
wand
as
she
did
the
marks
of
age
and
beggary
fell
from
him
and
the
man
stood
up
as
tall
and
noble
looking
art
thou
cried
telemachus
starting
up
a
moment
ago
thou
didst
look
aged
and
a
beggar
now
thou
dost
look
a
chief
of
men
art
thou
one
of
the
divine
ones
odysseus
looked
upon
him
and
said
son
do
not
speak
so
to
me
i
am
odysseus
thy
father
after
much
suffering
and
much
wandering
i
have
come
to
my
own
country
he
kissed
his
son
with
tears
flowing
down
his
cheeks
and
telemachus
threw
his
arms
around
his
father
neck
but
scarce
believing
that
the
father
he
had
searched
for
was
indeed
before
him
illustration
but
no
doubt
was
left
as
odysseus
talked
to
him
and
told
him
how
he
had
come
to
ithaka
in
a
ship
given
him
by
the
ph√¶acians
and
how
he
had
brought
with
him
gifts
of
bronze
and
raiment
that
were
hidden
in
the
cave
and
told
him
too
how
pallas
athene
had
changed
his
appearance
into
that
of
an
old
beggar
and
when
his
own
story
was
finished
he
said
my
son
tell
me
of
the
wooers
who
waste
the
substance
of
our
house
tell
me
how
many
they
number
and
who
they
are
so
that
we
may
prepare
a
way
of
dealing
with
them
though
thou
art
a
great
warrior
my
father
thou
and
i
can
not
hope
to
deal
with
them
they
have
come
not
from
ithaka
alone
but
from
all
the
islands
around
from
dulichium
and
same
and
zacynthus
we
two
can
not
deal
with
such
a
throng
said
odysseus
shall
make
a
plan
to
deal
with
them
go
thou
home
and
keep
company
with
the
wooers
later
in
the
day
the
swineherd
will
lead
me
into
the
city
and
i
shall
go
into
the
house
in
the
likeness
of
an
old
beggar
and
if
thou
shouldst
see
any
of
the
wooers
me
harden
thine
heart
to
endure
it
even
if
they
drag
me
by
the
feet
to
the
door
of
the
house
keep
quiet
thou
and
let
no
one
not
even
thy
mother
penelope
nor
my
father
laertes
know
that
odysseus
hath
returned
telemachus
said
father
thou
shalt
learn
soon
what
spirit
is
in
me
and
what
wisdom
i
have
while
they
talked
together
the
ship
that
antinous
had
taken
when
he
went
to
lie
in
wait
for
telemachus
returned
the
wooers
assembled
and
debated
whether
they
should
kill
telemachus
for
now
there
was
danger
that
he
would
draw
the
people
to
his
side
and
so
make
up
a
force
that
could
drive
the
wooers
out
of
ithaka
but
they
did
not
agree
to
kill
him
then
for
there
was
one
amongst
them
who
was
against
the
deed
eum√¶us
brought
the
news
to
telemachus
and
odysseus
of
the
return
of
antinous
ship
he
came
back
to
the
hut
in
the
afternoon
pallas
athene
had
again
given
odysseus
the
appearance
of
an
ancient
and
the
swineherd
saw
no
change
in
his
guest
x
it
was
time
for
telemachus
to
go
into
the
city
he
put
his
sandals
on
his
feet
and
took
his
spear
in
his
hand
and
then
speaking
to
the
swineherd
he
said
eum√¶us
i
am
now
going
into
the
city
to
show
myself
to
my
mother
and
to
let
her
hear
from
my
own
lips
the
tale
of
my
journey
and
i
have
an
order
to
leave
with
thee
take
this
stranger
into
the
city
that
he
may
go
about
as
he
desires
asking
alms
from
the
people
odysseus
in
the
guise
of
a
beggar
said
thank
thee
lord
telemachus
i
would
not
stay
here
for
i
am
not
of
an
age
to
wait
about
a
hut
and
courtyard
obeying
the
orders
of
a
master
even
if
that
master
be
as
good
a
man
as
thy
swineherd
go
thy
way
lord
telemachus
and
eum√¶us
as
thou
hast
bidden
him
will
lead
me
into
the
city
telemachus
then
passed
out
of
the
courtyard
and
went
the
ways
until
he
came
into
the
city
when
he
went
into
the
house
the
first
person
he
saw
was
his
nurse
old
eurycleia
who
welcomed
him
with
joy
to
eurycleia
he
spoke
of
the
guest
who
had
come
on
his
ship
theoclymenus
he
told
her
that
this
guest
would
be
in
the
house
that
day
and
that
he
was
to
be
treated
with
all
honour
and
reverence
the
wooers
came
into
the
hall
and
crowded
around
him
with
fair
words
in
their
mouths
then
all
sat
down
at
tables
and
eurycleia
brought
wheaten
bread
and
wine
and
dainties
just
at
that
time
odysseus
and
eum√¶us
were
journeying
towards
the
city
odysseus
in
the
guise
of
a
beggar
had
a
ragged
bag
across
his
shoulders
and
he
carried
a
staff
that
the
swineherd
had
given
him
to
help
him
over
the
slippery
ground
they
went
by
a
rugged
path
and
they
came
to
a
place
where
a
spring
flowed
into
a
basin
made
for
its
water
and
where
there
was
an
altar
to
the
nymphs
at
which
men
made
offerings
as
eum√¶us
and
odysseus
were
resting
at
the
spring
a
servant
from
odysseus
house
came
along
he
was
a
goatherd
and
melanthius
was
his
name
he
was
leading
a
flock
of
goats
for
the
wooers
to
kill
and
when
he
saw
the
swineherd
with
the
seeming
beggar
he
cried
out
we
see
the
vile
leading
the
vile
say
swineherd
whither
art
thou
leading
this
wretch
it
is
easy
to
see
the
sort
of
fellow
he
is
he
is
the
sort
to
rub
shoulders
against
many
doorposts
begging
for
scraps
nothing
else
is
he
good
for
but
if
thou
wouldst
give
him
to
me
swineherd
i
would
make
him
watch
my
fields
and
sweep
out
my
stalls
and
carry
fresh
water
to
the
kids
he
have
his
dish
of
whey
from
me
but
a
fellow
like
this
does
want
an
honest
job
he
wants
to
lounge
through
the
country
filling
his
belly
without
doing
anything
for
the
people
who
feed
him
up
if
he
goes
to
the
house
of
odysseus
i
pray
that
he
be
pelted
from
the
door
he
said
all
this
as
he
came
up
to
them
with
his
flock
of
goats
and
as
he
went
by
he
gave
a
kick
to
odysseus
odysseus
took
thought
whether
he
should
strike
the
fellow
with
his
staff
or
fling
him
upon
the
ground
but
in
the
end
he
hardened
his
heart
to
endure
the
insult
and
let
the
goatherd
go
on
his
way
but
turning
to
the
altar
that
was
by
the
spring
he
prayed
of
the
well
if
ever
odysseus
made
offerings
to
you
fulfil
for
me
this
wish
that
he
even
odysseus
may
come
to
his
own
home
and
have
power
to
chastise
the
insolence
that
gathers
around
his
house
they
journeyed
on
and
when
they
came
near
they
heard
the
sound
of
the
lyre
within
the
house
the
wooers
were
now
feasting
and
phemius
the
minstrel
was
singing
to
them
and
when
odysseus
came
before
his
own
house
he
caught
the
swineherd
by
the
hand
suddenly
and
with
a
hard
grip
and
he
said
now
i
who
have
wandered
in
many
lands
and
have
walked
in
pain
through
many
cities
have
come
at
last
to
the
house
of
odysseus
there
it
is
standing
as
of
old
with
building
beyond
building
with
its
walls
and
its
battlements
its
courts
and
its
doors
the
house
of
odysseus
verily
and
lo
unwelcome
men
keep
revel
within
it
and
the
smoke
of
their
feast
rises
up
and
the
sound
of
the
lyre
is
heard
playing
for
them
said
eum√¶us
wilt
thou
have
me
do
for
thee
friend
shall
i
bring
thee
into
the
hall
and
before
the
company
of
wooers
whilst
i
remain
here
or
wouldst
thou
have
me
go
in
before
thee
would
have
thee
go
in
before
me
odysseus
said
now
as
they
went
through
the
courtyard
a
thing
happened
that
dashed
odysseus
eyes
with
tears
a
hound
lay
in
the
dirt
of
the
yard
a
hound
that
was
very
old
all
uncared
for
he
lay
in
the
dirt
old
and
feeble
but
he
had
been
a
famous
hound
and
odysseus
himself
had
trained
him
before
he
went
to
the
wars
of
troy
argos
was
his
name
now
as
odysseus
came
near
the
hound
argos
knew
him
and
stood
up
before
him
and
whined
and
dropped
his
ears
but
had
no
strength
to
come
near
him
odysseus
knew
the
hound
and
stopped
and
gazed
at
him
good
hound
lies
there
said
he
to
eum√¶us
i
think
he
was
so
swift
that
no
beast
in
the
deep
places
of
the
wood
could
flee
from
him
then
he
went
on
and
the
hound
argos
lay
down
in
the
dirt
of
the
yard
and
that
same
day
the
life
passed
from
him
illustration
behind
eum√¶us
the
swineherd
he
came
into
his
own
hall
in
the
appearance
of
a
beggar
wretchedly
clad
and
leaning
on
an
old
staff
odysseus
looked
upon
the
young
lords
who
wooed
his
wife
and
then
he
sat
down
upon
the
threshold
and
went
no
further
into
the
hall
telemachus
was
there
seeing
eum√¶us
he
called
to
him
and
gave
the
swineherd
bread
and
meat
and
said
these
and
give
them
to
the
stranger
at
the
doorway
and
tell
him
that
he
may
go
amongst
the
company
and
crave
an
alms
from
each
odysseus
ate
whilst
the
minstrel
was
finishing
his
song
when
it
was
finished
he
rose
up
and
went
into
the
hall
craving
an
alms
from
each
of
the
wooers
seeing
him
antinous
the
most
insolent
of
the
wooers
cried
out
notorious
swineherd
why
didst
thou
bring
this
fellow
here
have
we
not
enough
vagabonds
is
it
nothing
to
thee
that
worthless
fellows
come
here
and
devour
thy
master
substance
hearing
such
a
speech
from
antinous
telemachus
had
to
say
i
see
that
thou
hast
good
care
for
me
and
mine
i
marvel
that
thou
hast
such
good
care
but
wouldst
thou
have
me
drive
a
stranger
from
the
door
the
gods
forbid
that
i
should
do
such
a
thing
nay
antinous
give
the
stranger
something
for
the
sake
of
the
house
all
the
company
gives
him
as
much
as
i
he
will
have
something
to
keep
him
from
beggary
for
a
three
months
space
said
antinous
meaning
by
that
that
he
would
work
some
hurt
upon
the
beggar
odysseus
came
before
him
say
that
thou
art
the
noblest
of
all
the
wooers
he
said
for
that
reason
thou
shouldst
give
me
a
better
thing
than
any
of
the
others
have
given
me
look
upon
me
i
too
had
a
house
of
mine
own
and
was
accounted
wealthy
amongst
men
and
i
had
servants
to
wait
upon
me
and
many
a
time
would
i
make
welcome
the
wanderer
and
give
him
something
from
my
store
far
away
from
my
table
thou
wretched
fellow
said
antinous
then
said
odysseus
hast
beauty
lord
antinous
but
thou
hast
not
wisdom
out
of
thine
own
house
thou
wouldst
not
give
a
grain
of
salt
to
a
suppliant
and
even
whilst
thou
dost
sit
at
another
man
table
thou
dost
not
find
it
in
thy
heart
to
give
something
out
of
the
plenty
that
is
before
thee
so
odysseus
spoke
and
antinous
became
terribly
angered
he
caught
up
a
footstool
and
with
it
he
struck
odysseus
in
the
back
at
the
base
of
the
right
shoulder
such
a
blow
would
have
knocked
another
man
over
but
odysseus
stood
steadfast
under
it
he
gave
one
look
at
antinous
and
then
without
a
word
he
went
over
and
sat
down
again
upon
the
threshold
telemachus
had
in
his
heart
a
mighty
rage
for
the
stroke
that
had
been
given
his
father
but
he
let
no
tear
fall
from
his
eyes
and
he
sat
very
still
brooding
in
his
heart
evil
for
the
wooers
odysseus
after
a
while
lifted
his
head
and
spoke
illustration
of
the
renowned
queen
he
said
what
the
spirit
within
me
bids
me
say
to
you
there
is
neither
pain
nor
shame
in
the
blow
that
a
man
may
get
in
battle
but
in
the
blow
that
antinous
has
given
me
a
blow
aimed
at
a
beggar
there
is
pain
and
there
is
shame
and
now
i
call
upon
that
god
who
is
the
avenger
of
the
insult
to
the
poor
to
bring
not
a
wedding
to
antinous
but
the
issue
of
death
there
and
eat
thy
meat
in
quiet
antinous
called
out
else
thou
wilt
be
dragged
through
the
house
by
thy
heels
and
the
flesh
will
be
stripped
off
thy
bones
and
now
the
lady
penelope
had
come
into
the
hall
hearing
that
a
stranger
was
there
she
sent
for
eum√¶us
and
bade
the
swineherd
bring
him
to
her
that
she
might
question
him
as
to
what
he
had
heard
about
odysseus
eum√¶us
came
and
told
him
of
penelope
request
but
odysseus
said
right
willing
am
i
to
tell
the
truth
about
odysseus
to
the
fair
and
wise
penelope
but
now
i
may
not
speak
to
her
go
to
her
and
tell
her
that
when
the
wooers
have
gone
i
will
speak
to
her
and
ask
her
to
give
me
a
seat
near
the
fire
that
i
may
sit
and
warm
myself
as
i
speak
for
the
clothes
i
wear
are
comfortless
as
eum√¶us
gave
the
message
to
the
lady
penelope
one
who
was
there
theoclymenus
the
guest
who
had
come
in
telemachus
ship
said
wife
of
the
renowned
odysseus
be
sure
that
thy
lord
will
return
to
his
house
as
i
came
here
on
the
ship
of
telemachus
thy
son
i
saw
a
happening
that
is
an
omen
of
the
return
of
odysseus
a
bird
flew
out
on
the
right
a
hawk
in
his
talons
he
held
a
dove
and
plucked
her
and
shed
the
feathers
down
on
the
ship
by
that
omen
i
know
that
the
lord
of
this
high
house
will
return
and
strike
here
in
his
anger
penelope
left
the
hall
and
went
back
to
her
own
chamber
next
eum√¶us
went
away
to
look
after
his
swine
but
still
the
wooers
continued
to
feast
and
still
odysseus
sat
in
the
guise
of
a
beggar
on
the
threshold
of
his
own
house
xi
there
was
in
ithaka
a
common
beggar
he
was
a
most
greedy
fellow
and
he
was
nicknamed
irus
because
he
used
to
run
errands
for
the
servants
of
odysseus
house
he
came
in
the
evening
and
seeing
a
seeming
beggar
seated
on
the
threshold
he
flew
into
a
rage
and
shouted
at
him
away
from
here
old
fellow
lest
you
be
dragged
away
by
the
hand
or
foot
look
you
the
lords
within
the
house
are
giving
me
the
wink
to
turn
you
out
but
i
ca
demean
myself
by
touching
the
like
of
you
get
up
now
and
go
while
i
easy
with
you
odysseus
looked
at
the
fellow
and
said
have
not
harmed
you
in
deed
or
word
and
i
do
not
grudge
you
anything
of
what
you
may
get
in
this
house
the
threshold
i
sit
on
is
wide
enough
for
two
of
us
words
this
fellow
has
said
irus
the
beggar
talks
like
an
old
i
not
waste
more
words
on
him
get
up
now
heavy
paunch
and
strip
for
the
fight
for
i
going
to
show
all
the
lords
that
i
can
keep
the
door
for
them
not
provoke
me
said
odysseus
as
i
seem
i
may
be
able
to
draw
your
blood
but
irus
kept
on
shouting
knock
the
teeth
out
of
your
jaws
trounce
you
antinous
the
most
insolent
of
the
wooers
saw
the
squabble
and
he
laughed
to
see
the
pair
defying
each
other
said
he
gods
are
good
to
us
and
do
fail
to
send
us
amusement
the
strange
beggar
and
our
own
irus
are
threatening
each
other
let
us
see
that
they
do
draw
back
from
the
fight
let
us
match
one
against
the
other
all
the
wooers
trooped
to
the
threshold
and
stood
round
the
ragged
men
antinous
thought
of
something
to
make
the
game
more
merry
are
two
great
puddings
in
the
larder
he
said
us
offer
them
for
a
prize
to
these
pugilists
come
irus
come
stranger
a
choice
of
puddings
for
whichever
of
you
wins
the
match
aye
and
more
than
that
whoever
wins
shall
have
leave
to
eat
every
day
in
this
hall
and
no
other
beggar
shall
be
let
come
near
the
house
go
to
it
now
ye
mighty
men
all
the
wooers
crowded
round
and
clapped
the
men
on
to
the
fight
odysseus
said
an
old
man
like
me
can
not
fight
one
who
is
younger
and
abler
but
they
cried
to
him
on
go
on
get
into
the
fight
or
else
take
stripes
upon
your
body
then
said
odysseus
to
me
all
of
you
that
none
of
you
will
show
favour
to
irus
nor
deal
me
a
foul
blow
all
the
wooers
cried
out
that
none
would
favour
irus
or
deal
his
opponent
a
foul
blow
and
telemachus
who
was
there
said
man
who
strikes
thee
stranger
will
have
to
take
reckoning
from
me
straightway
odysseus
girt
up
his
rags
when
his
great
arms
and
shoulders
and
thighs
were
seen
the
wooers
were
amazed
and
irus
was
frightened
he
would
have
slipped
away
if
antinous
had
not
caught
him
and
said
to
him
lubber
you
if
you
do
not
stand
up
before
this
man
i
will
have
you
flung
on
my
ship
and
sent
over
to
king
echetus
who
will
cut
off
your
nose
and
ears
and
give
your
flesh
to
his
dogs
to
eat
he
took
hold
of
irus
and
dragged
him
into
the
ring
the
fighters
faced
each
other
but
odysseus
with
his
hands
upraised
stood
for
long
without
striking
for
he
was
pondering
whether
he
should
strike
irus
a
hard
or
a
light
blow
it
seemed
to
him
better
to
strike
him
lightly
so
that
his
strength
should
not
be
made
a
matter
for
the
wooers
to
note
and
wonder
at
irus
struck
first
he
struck
odysseus
on
the
shoulder
then
odysseus
aimed
a
blow
at
his
neck
just
below
the
ear
and
the
beggar
fell
to
the
ground
with
the
blood
gushing
from
his
mouth
and
nose
illustration
the
wooers
were
not
sorry
for
irus
they
laughed
until
they
were
ready
to
fall
backwards
then
odysseus
seized
irus
by
the
feet
and
dragged
him
out
of
the
house
and
to
the
gate
of
the
courtyard
he
lifted
him
up
and
put
him
standing
against
the
wall
placing
the
staff
in
the
hands
he
said
sit
there
and
scare
off
the
dogs
and
swine
and
do
not
let
such
a
one
as
you
lord
it
over
strangers
a
worse
thing
might
have
befallen
you
then
back
he
went
to
the
hall
with
his
beggar
bag
on
his
shoulder
and
his
clothes
more
ragged
than
ever
back
he
went
and
when
the
wooers
saw
him
they
burst
into
peals
of
laughter
and
shouted
out
zeus
o
stranger
give
thee
thy
dearest
wish
and
thy
desire
thou
only
shalt
be
beggar
in
ithaka
they
laughed
and
laughed
again
when
antinous
brought
out
the
great
pudding
that
was
the
prize
odysseus
took
it
from
him
and
another
of
the
wooers
pledged
him
in
a
golden
cup
saying
you
come
to
your
own
o
beggar
and
may
happiness
be
yours
in
time
to
come
while
these
things
were
happening
the
wife
of
odysseus
the
lady
penelope
called
to
eurycleia
and
said
evening
i
will
go
into
the
hall
of
our
house
and
speak
to
my
son
telemachus
bid
my
two
handmaidens
make
ready
to
come
with
me
for
i
shrink
from
going
amongst
the
wooers
alone
eurycleia
went
to
tell
the
handmaidens
and
penelope
washed
off
her
cheeks
the
traces
of
the
tears
that
she
had
wept
that
day
then
she
sat
down
to
wait
for
the
handmaidens
to
come
to
her
as
she
waited
she
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
and
as
she
slept
the
goddess
pallas
athene
bathed
her
face
in
the
water
of
beauty
and
took
all
weariness
away
from
her
body
and
restored
all
her
youthfulness
to
her
the
sound
of
the
handmaidens
voices
as
they
came
in
awakened
her
and
penelope
rose
up
to
go
into
the
hall
now
when
she
came
amongst
them
with
her
two
handmaidens
one
standing
each
side
of
her
the
wooers
were
amazed
for
they
had
never
seen
one
so
beautiful
the
hearts
of
all
were
enchanted
with
love
for
her
and
each
prayed
that
he
might
have
her
for
his
wife
penelope
did
not
look
on
any
of
the
wooers
but
she
went
to
her
son
telemachus
and
spoke
to
him
she
said
have
heard
that
a
stranger
has
been
in
this
house
how
my
child
didst
thou
permit
such
a
thing
to
happen
telemachus
said
lady
mother
thou
hast
no
right
to
be
angered
at
what
took
place
in
this
hall
so
they
spoke
to
one
another
mother
and
son
now
one
of
the
wooers
eurymachus
by
name
spoke
to
penelope
saying
if
any
more
than
we
beheld
thee
in
the
beauty
thou
hast
now
by
so
many
more
wouldst
thou
have
wooers
not
so
to
me
lord
eurymachus
said
penelope
not
of
my
beauty
which
departed
in
the
grief
i
felt
when
my
lord
went
to
the
wars
of
troy
illustration
odysseus
stood
up
and
gazed
upon
his
wife
who
was
standing
amongst
her
wooers
eurymachus
noted
him
and
going
to
him
said
wouldst
thou
be
my
hireling
if
thou
wouldst
work
on
my
upland
farm
i
should
give
thee
food
and
clothes
but
i
think
thou
art
practised
only
in
shifts
and
dodges
and
that
thou
wouldst
prefer
to
go
begging
thy
way
through
the
country
odysseus
standing
there
said
to
that
proud
wooer
eurymachus
if
there
might
be
a
trial
of
labour
between
us
two
i
know
which
of
us
would
come
out
the
better
man
i
would
that
we
two
stood
together
a
scythe
in
the
hands
of
each
and
a
good
swath
of
meadow
to
be
mown
then
would
i
match
with
thee
fasting
from
dawn
until
evening
dark
or
would
that
we
were
set
ploughing
together
then
thou
shouldst
see
who
would
plough
the
longest
and
the
best
furrow
or
would
that
we
two
were
in
the
ways
of
war
then
shouldst
thou
see
who
would
be
in
the
front
rank
of
battle
thou
dost
think
thyself
a
great
man
but
if
odysseus
should
return
that
door
wide
as
it
is
would
be
too
narrow
for
thy
flight
so
angry
was
eurymachus
at
this
speech
that
he
would
have
struck
odysseus
if
telemachus
had
not
come
amongst
the
wooers
saying
man
must
not
be
struck
again
in
this
hall
sirs
if
you
have
finished
feasting
and
if
the
time
has
come
for
you
go
to
your
own
homes
go
in
peace
i
pray
you
all
were
astonished
that
telemachus
should
speak
so
boldly
no
one
answered
him
back
for
one
said
to
the
other
he
has
said
is
proper
we
have
nothing
to
say
against
it
to
misuse
a
stranger
in
the
house
of
odysseus
is
a
shame
now
let
us
pour
out
a
libation
of
wine
to
the
gods
and
then
let
each
man
go
to
his
home
the
wine
was
poured
out
and
the
wooers
departed
then
penelope
and
her
handmaidens
went
to
her
own
chamber
and
telemachus
was
left
with
his
father
odysseus
xii
to
telemachus
odysseus
said
son
we
must
now
get
the
weapons
out
of
the
hall
take
them
down
from
the
walls
telemachus
and
his
father
took
down
the
helmets
and
shields
and
spears
then
said
odysseus
as
they
carried
them
out
when
the
wooers
miss
the
weapons
and
say
why
have
they
been
taken
answer
them
saying
the
smoke
of
the
fire
dulled
them
and
they
no
longer
looked
the
weapons
that
my
father
left
behind
him
when
he
went
to
the
wars
of
troy
besides
i
am
fearful
lest
some
day
the
company
in
the
hall
come
to
a
quarrel
one
with
the
other
and
snatch
the
weapons
in
anger
strife
has
come
here
already
and
iron
draws
iron
men
say
telemachus
carried
the
armour
and
weapons
out
of
the
hall
and
hid
them
in
the
women
apartment
then
when
the
hall
was
cleared
he
went
to
his
own
chamber
it
was
then
that
penelope
came
back
to
the
hall
to
speak
to
the
stranger
one
of
her
handmaidens
melantho
by
name
was
there
and
she
was
speaking
angrily
to
him
now
this
melantho
was
proud
and
hard
of
heart
because
antinous
often
conversed
with
her
as
penelope
came
near
she
was
saying
art
thou
still
here
prying
things
out
and
spying
on
the
servants
be
thankful
for
the
supper
thou
hast
gotten
and
betake
thyself
out
of
this
odysseus
looking
fiercely
at
her
said
shouldst
thou
speak
to
me
in
such
a
way
if
i
go
in
ragged
clothes
and
beg
through
the
land
it
is
because
of
my
necessity
once
i
had
a
house
with
servants
and
with
much
substance
and
the
stranger
who
came
there
was
not
abused
the
lady
penelope
called
to
the
handmaiden
and
said
melantho
didst
hear
it
from
mine
own
lips
that
i
was
minded
to
speak
to
this
stranger
and
ask
him
if
he
had
tidings
of
my
lord
therefore
it
does
not
become
thee
to
revile
him
she
spoke
to
the
old
nurse
who
had
come
with
her
and
said
bring
to
the
fire
a
bench
with
a
fleece
upon
it
that
this
stranger
may
sit
and
tell
me
his
story
eurycleia
brought
over
the
bench
and
odysseus
sat
down
near
the
fire
then
said
the
lady
penelope
stranger
wilt
thou
tell
me
who
thou
art
and
what
is
thy
name
and
thy
race
and
thy
country
said
odysseus
me
all
thou
wilt
lady
but
inquire
not
concerning
my
name
or
race
or
country
lest
thou
shouldst
fill
my
heart
with
more
pains
than
i
am
able
to
endure
verily
i
am
a
man
of
grief
but
hast
thou
no
tale
to
tell
me
we
know
of
thee
penelope
for
thy
fame
goes
up
to
heaven
and
no
one
of
mortal
men
can
find
fault
with
thee
then
said
penelope
excellence
i
had
of
face
or
form
departed
from
me
when
my
lord
odysseus
went
from
this
hall
to
the
wars
of
troy
and
since
he
went
a
host
of
ills
has
beset
me
ah
would
that
he
were
here
to
watch
over
my
life
the
lords
of
all
the
islands
around
dulichium
and
same
and
zacynthus
and
the
lords
of
the
land
of
ithaka
have
come
here
and
are
wooing
me
against
my
will
they
devour
the
substance
of
this
house
and
my
son
is
being
impoverished
ago
a
god
put
into
my
mind
a
device
to
keep
marriage
with
any
of
them
away
from
me
i
set
up
a
great
web
upon
my
loom
and
i
spoke
to
the
wooers
saying
odysseus
is
assuredly
dead
but
i
crave
that
you
be
not
eager
to
speed
on
this
marriage
with
me
wait
until
i
finish
the
web
i
am
weaving
it
is
a
shroud
for
odysseus
father
and
i
make
it
against
the
day
when
death
shall
come
to
him
there
will
be
no
woman
to
care
for
laertes
when
i
have
left
his
son
house
and
i
would
not
have
such
a
hero
lie
without
a
shroud
lest
the
women
of
our
land
should
blame
me
for
neglect
of
my
husband
father
in
his
last
days
i
spoke
and
they
agreed
to
wait
until
the
web
was
woven
in
the
daytime
i
wove
it
but
at
night
i
unravelled
the
web
so
three
years
passed
away
then
the
fourth
year
came
and
my
wooers
were
hard
to
deal
with
my
treacherous
handmaidens
brought
them
upon
me
as
i
was
unravelling
the
web
and
now
i
can
not
devise
any
other
plan
to
keep
the
marriage
away
from
me
my
parents
command
me
to
marry
one
of
my
wooers
my
son
can
not
long
endure
to
see
the
substance
of
his
house
and
field
being
wasted
and
the
wealth
that
should
be
his
destroyed
he
too
would
wish
that
i
should
marry
and
there
is
no
reason
why
i
should
not
be
wed
again
for
surely
odysseus
my
lord
is
dead
said
odysseus
lord
was
known
to
me
on
his
way
to
troy
he
came
to
my
land
for
the
wind
blew
him
out
of
his
course
sending
him
wandering
past
malea
for
twelve
days
he
stayed
in
my
city
and
i
gave
him
good
entertainment
and
saw
that
he
lacked
for
nothing
in
cattle
or
wine
or
barley
meal
when
odysseus
was
spoken
of
the
heart
of
penelope
melted
and
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
odysseus
had
pity
for
his
wife
when
he
saw
her
weeping
for
the
man
who
was
even
then
sitting
by
her
tears
would
have
run
down
his
own
cheeks
only
that
he
was
strong
enough
to
hold
them
back
said
penelope
i
can
not
help
but
question
thee
about
odysseus
what
raiment
had
he
on
when
thou
didst
see
him
and
what
men
were
with
him
said
odysseus
it
is
hard
for
one
so
long
parted
from
him
to
tell
thee
what
thou
hast
asked
it
is
now
twenty
years
since
i
saw
odysseus
he
wore
a
purple
mantle
that
was
fastened
with
a
brooch
and
this
brooch
had
on
it
the
image
of
a
hound
holding
a
fawn
between
its
all
the
people
marvelled
at
this
brooch
for
it
was
of
gold
and
the
fawn
and
the
hound
were
done
to
the
life
and
i
remember
that
there
was
a
henchman
with
odysseus
he
was
a
man
somewhat
older
than
his
master
round
shouldered
and
and
curly
headed
his
name
was
eurybates
and
odysseus
honoured
him
above
the
rest
of
his
company
when
he
spoke
giving
such
tokens
of
odysseus
penelope
wept
again
and
when
she
had
wept
for
a
long
time
she
said
thou
wert
made
welcome
but
now
thou
shalt
be
honoured
in
this
hall
thou
dost
speak
of
the
garments
that
odysseus
wore
it
was
i
who
gave
him
these
garments
folding
them
myself
and
bringing
them
out
of
the
chamber
and
it
was
i
who
gave
him
the
brooch
that
thou
hast
described
ah
it
was
an
evil
fate
that
took
him
from
me
bringing
him
to
troy
that
place
too
evil
to
be
named
by
me
odysseus
leaned
towards
her
and
said
do
not
waste
thy
heart
with
endless
weeping
lady
cease
from
lamentation
and
lay
up
in
thy
mind
the
word
i
give
thee
odysseus
is
near
he
has
lost
all
his
companions
and
he
knows
not
how
to
come
into
this
house
whether
openly
or
by
stealth
i
swear
it
by
the
hearth
of
odysseus
to
which
i
am
come
i
swear
that
odysseus
himself
will
stand
up
here
before
the
old
moon
wanes
and
the
new
moon
is
born
no
said
penelope
before
have
wanderers
told
me
such
comfortable
things
and
i
believed
them
i
know
now
that
thy
word
can
not
be
accomplished
but
it
is
time
for
thee
to
rest
thyself
stranger
my
handmaidens
will
make
a
bed
for
thee
in
the
vestibule
and
then
come
to
thee
and
bathe
thy
feet
said
odysseus
handmaidens
would
be
loath
to
touch
the
feet
of
a
wanderer
such
as
i
but
if
there
is
in
the
house
some
old
wife
who
has
borne
such
troubles
as
i
have
borne
i
would
have
my
feet
bathed
by
her
said
penelope
is
an
ancient
woman
who
nursed
and
tended
that
hapless
man
odysseus
she
took
him
in
her
arms
in
the
very
hour
he
was
born
eurycleia
wash
the
feet
of
this
man
who
knew
thy
lord
and
mine
thereupon
the
nurse
old
eurycleia
fetched
water
both
hot
and
cold
and
brought
the
bath
to
the
hearth
and
standing
before
odysseus
in
the
flickering
light
of
the
fire
she
said
will
wash
thy
feet
both
for
penelope
sake
and
for
thine
own
the
heart
within
me
is
moved
at
the
sight
of
thee
many
strangers
have
come
into
this
hall
but
i
have
never
seen
one
that
was
so
like
as
thou
art
to
odysseus
said
odysseus
people
have
said
that
odysseus
and
i
favour
each
other
his
feet
were
in
the
water
and
she
put
her
hand
upon
one
of
them
as
she
did
so
odysseus
turned
his
face
away
to
the
darkness
for
it
suddenly
came
into
his
mind
that
his
nurse
old
eurycleia
might
recognize
the
scar
that
was
upon
that
foot
how
came
it
there
that
scar
it
had
been
made
long
ago
when
a
tusk
had
ripped
up
the
flesh
of
his
foot
odysseus
was
then
a
youth
and
he
had
gone
to
the
mountain
parnassus
to
visit
there
his
father
one
morning
with
his
uncles
young
odysseus
went
up
the
slope
of
the
mountain
parnassus
to
hunt
with
hounds
in
a
thick
lair
a
mighty
boar
was
lying
when
the
sound
of
the
men
trampling
came
near
him
he
sprang
up
with
gleaming
eyes
and
stood
before
them
all
odysseus
holding
his
spear
in
his
hands
rushed
upon
him
but
before
he
could
strike
him
the
boar
charged
ripping
deep
into
his
flesh
with
his
tusk
then
odysseus
speared
him
through
the
shoulder
and
the
boar
was
slain
his
uncles
staunched
the
wound
and
he
stayed
with
them
on
the
mountain
parnassus
in
his
grandfather
house
until
the
wound
was
healed
and
now
as
eurycleia
his
old
nurse
passed
her
hands
along
the
leg
she
let
his
foot
drop
suddenly
his
knee
struck
against
the
bath
and
the
vessel
of
water
was
overturned
the
nurse
touched
the
chin
of
odysseus
and
she
said
art
odysseus
she
looked
to
where
penelope
was
sitting
so
that
she
might
make
a
sign
to
her
but
penelope
had
her
eyes
turned
away
odysseus
put
his
hand
on
eurycleia
mouth
and
with
the
other
hand
he
drew
her
to
him
he
whispered
nothing
be
silent
lest
mine
enemies
learn
what
thou
knowest
now
i
be
said
the
nurse
eurycleia
knowest
me
firm
and
unyielding
i
am
and
by
no
sign
will
i
let
anyone
know
that
thou
hast
come
under
this
roof
illustration
so
saying
she
went
out
of
the
hall
to
fetch
water
in
the
place
of
that
which
had
been
spilt
she
came
back
and
finished
bathing
his
feet
then
odysseus
arranged
the
rags
around
his
leg
to
hide
the
scar
and
he
drew
the
bench
closer
to
the
fire
penelope
turned
to
him
again
thou
art
my
guest
she
said
it
may
be
that
thou
art
just
such
a
man
as
can
interpret
a
dream
that
comes
to
me
constantly
i
have
twenty
geese
in
the
yard
outside
in
my
dream
i
see
them
and
then
a
great
eagle
flies
down
from
the
mountains
and
breaks
their
necks
and
kills
them
all
and
lays
them
in
a
heap
in
this
hall
i
weep
and
lament
for
my
geese
but
then
the
eagle
comes
back
and
perching
on
a
beam
of
the
roof
speaks
to
me
in
the
voice
of
a
man
take
heart
o
wife
of
odysseus
the
eagle
says
this
is
no
dream
but
a
true
vision
for
the
geese
that
thou
hast
seen
are
thy
wooers
and
i
that
appeared
as
an
eagle
am
thy
husband
who
will
swiftly
bring
death
to
the
wooers
then
the
dream
goes
and
i
waken
and
look
out
on
the
daylight
and
see
my
geese
in
the
courtyard
pecking
at
the
wheat
in
the
trough
canst
thou
interpret
this
dream
said
odysseus
dream
interprets
itself
all
will
come
about
as
thou
hast
dreamed
said
penelope
it
can
not
now
for
the
day
of
my
woe
is
at
hand
i
am
being
forced
by
my
parents
to
choose
a
husband
from
the
wooers
and
depart
from
the
house
of
odysseus
how
wilt
thou
choose
from
amongst
them
said
odysseus
this
way
will
i
make
choice
said
penelope
husband
great
bow
is
still
in
the
house
the
one
who
can
bend
that
bow
and
shoot
an
arrow
through
the
holes
in
the
backs
of
twelve
axes
set
one
behind
the
other
him
will
i
choose
for
my
husband
said
odysseus
device
is
good
penelope
and
some
god
hath
instructed
thee
to
do
this
but
delay
no
longer
the
contest
of
the
bow
let
it
be
that
thy
counsel
o
stranger
said
penelope
is
my
counsel
said
odysseus
thank
thee
for
thy
counsel
she
said
now
farewell
for
i
must
go
to
my
rest
and
do
thou
lie
down
in
the
vestibule
in
the
bed
that
has
been
made
for
thee
so
penelope
spoke
and
then
she
went
to
her
chamber
with
her
handmaidens
and
in
her
bed
she
thought
over
all
the
stranger
had
told
her
of
odysseus
and
she
wept
again
for
him
xiii
all
night
odysseus
lay
awake
tossing
this
side
and
that
as
he
pondered
on
how
he
might
slay
the
wooers
and
save
his
house
from
them
as
soon
as
the
dawn
came
he
went
into
the
open
air
and
lifting
up
his
hands
prayed
to
zeus
the
greatest
of
the
gods
that
he
might
be
shown
some
sign
as
to
whether
he
would
win
victory
or
meet
with
defeat
and
then
as
he
was
going
within
the
house
he
heard
the
voice
of
a
woman
who
ground
between
stones
she
was
one
of
twelve
but
the
other
women
had
fallen
asleep
by
the
she
was
an
ancient
wretched
woman
covered
all
over
with
the
dust
of
the
grain
and
as
odysseus
came
near
her
she
lifted
up
her
hands
and
prayed
in
a
weak
voice
zeus
even
for
miserable
me
fulfil
a
prayer
may
this
be
the
last
day
that
the
wooers
make
their
feast
in
the
house
of
odysseus
they
have
loosened
my
knees
with
the
cruel
toil
they
have
made
me
undergo
grinding
for
them
the
barley
for
the
bread
they
eat
o
zeus
may
they
sup
their
last
thus
the
spoke
as
odysseus
crossed
his
threshold
he
was
glad
of
her
speech
for
it
seemed
to
him
her
words
were
an
omen
from
zeus
and
that
vengeance
would
soon
be
wrought
upon
the
proud
and
men
who
wasted
the
goods
of
the
house
and
oppressed
the
servants
and
now
the
maids
came
into
the
hall
from
the
women
apartment
and
some
cleaned
the
tables
and
others
took
pitchers
and
went
to
the
well
for
water
then
came
in
and
split
the
fagots
for
the
fire
other
servants
came
into
the
courtyard
eum√¶us
the
swineherd
driving
fatted
swine
the
best
of
his
drove
and
phil≈ìtius
the
bringing
a
calf
the
goatherd
melanthius
him
whom
odysseus
and
eum√¶us
had
met
on
the
road
the
day
before
also
came
bringing
the
best
goats
of
his
flock
to
be
killed
for
the
wooers
feast
when
the
phil≈ìtius
saw
a
stranger
in
the
guise
of
a
beggar
he
called
out
as
he
tethered
the
calf
in
the
yard
stranger
friend
my
eyes
fill
with
tears
as
i
look
on
thee
for
even
now
clad
as
thou
art
in
rags
thou
dost
make
me
think
of
my
master
odysseus
who
may
be
a
wanderer
such
as
thou
in
friendless
lands
ah
that
he
might
return
and
make
a
scattering
of
the
wooers
in
his
hall
eum√¶us
the
swineherd
came
up
to
phil≈ìtius
and
made
the
same
prayer
these
two
and
the
ancient
woman
at
the
quern
were
the
only
ones
of
his
servants
whom
he
heard
pray
for
his
return
and
now
the
wooers
came
into
the
hall
phil≈ìtius
the
and
melanthius
the
evil
goatherd
went
amongst
them
handing
them
bread
and
meat
and
wine
odysseus
stood
outside
the
hall
until
telemachus
went
to
him
and
brought
him
within
now
there
was
amongst
the
wooers
a
man
named
ctesippus
and
he
was
the
rudest
and
the
roughest
of
them
all
when
he
saw
telemachus
bringing
odysseus
within
he
shouted
out
is
a
guest
of
telemachus
to
whom
some
gift
is
due
from
us
it
will
be
unseemly
if
he
should
get
nothing
therefore
i
will
bestow
this
upon
him
as
a
token
saying
this
ctesippus
took
up
the
foot
of
a
slaughtered
ox
and
flung
it
full
at
odysseus
odysseus
drew
back
and
the
ox
foot
struck
the
wall
then
did
odysseus
smile
grimly
upon
the
wooers
said
telemachus
ctesippus
the
cast
turned
out
happily
for
thyself
for
if
thou
shouldst
have
struck
my
guest
there
would
have
been
a
funeral
feast
instead
of
a
wedding
banquet
in
thy
father
house
assuredly
i
should
have
driven
my
spear
through
thee
all
the
wooers
were
silent
when
telemachus
spoke
these
bold
words
but
soon
they
fell
laughing
at
something
one
of
their
number
said
the
guest
from
telemachus
ship
theoclymenus
was
there
and
he
started
up
and
went
to
leave
the
hall
dost
thou
go
my
guest
said
telemachus
see
the
walls
and
the
beams
of
the
roof
sprinkled
with
blood
said
theoclymenus
the
man
hear
the
voice
of
wailing
i
see
cheeks
wet
with
tears
the
men
before
me
have
shrouds
upon
them
the
courtyard
is
filled
with
ghosts
so
theoclymenus
spoke
and
all
the
wooers
laughed
at
the
man
for
he
stumbled
about
the
hall
as
if
it
were
in
darkness
then
said
one
of
the
wooers
that
man
out
of
the
house
for
surely
he
can
not
tell
day
from
night
will
go
from
the
place
said
theoclymenus
see
death
approaching
not
one
of
all
the
company
before
me
will
be
able
to
avoid
it
illustration
so
saying
the
man
went
out
of
the
hall
the
wooers
looking
at
each
other
laughed
again
and
one
of
them
said
has
no
luck
in
his
guests
one
is
a
dirty
beggar
who
thinks
of
nothing
but
what
he
can
put
from
his
hand
into
his
mouth
and
the
other
wants
to
stand
up
here
and
play
the
seer
so
the
wooers
spake
in
mockery
but
neither
telemachus
nor
odysseus
paid
heed
to
their
words
for
their
minds
were
bent
upon
the
time
when
they
should
take
vengeance
upon
them
xiv
in
the
of
the
house
odysseus
great
bow
was
kept
that
bow
had
been
given
to
him
by
a
hero
named
iphitus
long
ago
odysseus
had
not
taken
it
with
him
when
he
went
to
the
wars
of
troy
to
the
penelope
went
she
carried
in
her
hand
the
great
key
that
opened
the
doors
a
key
all
of
bronze
with
a
handle
of
ivory
now
as
she
thrust
the
key
into
the
locks
the
doors
groaned
as
a
bull
groans
she
went
within
and
saw
the
great
bow
upon
its
peg
she
took
it
down
and
laid
it
upon
her
knees
and
thought
long
upon
the
man
who
had
bent
it
beside
the
bow
was
its
quiver
full
of
arrows
the
servant
took
the
quiver
and
penelope
took
the
bow
and
they
went
from
the
and
into
the
hall
where
the
wooers
were
when
she
came
in
she
spoke
to
the
company
and
said
of
ithaka
and
of
the
islands
around
you
have
come
here
each
desiring
that
i
should
wed
him
now
the
time
has
come
for
me
to
make
my
choice
of
a
man
from
amongst
you
here
is
how
i
shall
make
choice
is
the
bow
of
odysseus
my
lord
who
is
no
more
whosoever
amongst
you
who
can
bend
this
bow
and
shoot
an
arrow
from
it
through
the
holes
in
the
backs
of
twelve
axes
which
i
shall
have
set
up
him
will
i
wed
and
to
his
house
i
will
go
forsaking
the
house
of
my
wedlock
this
house
so
filled
with
treasure
and
substance
this
house
which
i
shall
remember
in
my
dreams
as
she
spoke
telemachus
took
the
twelve
axes
and
set
them
upright
in
an
even
line
so
that
one
could
shoot
an
arrow
through
the
hole
that
was
in
the
back
of
each
then
eum√¶us
the
old
swineherd
took
the
bow
of
odysseus
and
laid
it
before
the
wooers
one
of
the
wooers
took
up
the
bow
and
tried
to
bend
it
but
he
could
not
bend
it
and
he
laid
it
down
at
the
doorway
with
the
arrow
beside
it
the
others
took
up
the
bow
and
warmed
it
at
the
fire
and
rubbed
it
with
lard
to
make
it
more
pliable
as
they
were
doing
this
eum√¶us
the
swineherd
and
phil≈ìtius
the
cattleherd
passed
out
of
the
hall
odysseus
followed
them
into
the
courtyard
he
laid
a
hand
on
each
and
said
and
cattleherd
i
have
a
word
to
say
to
you
but
will
you
keep
it
to
yourselves
the
word
i
say
and
first
what
would
you
do
to
help
odysseus
if
he
should
return
would
you
stand
on
his
side
or
on
the
side
of
the
wooers
answer
me
now
from
your
hearts
said
phil≈ìtius
the
cattleherd
zeus
fulfil
my
wish
and
bring
odysseus
back
then
thou
shouldst
know
on
whose
side
i
would
stand
and
eum√¶us
said
odysseus
should
return
i
would
be
on
his
side
and
that
with
all
the
strength
that
is
in
me
when
they
said
this
odysseus
declared
himself
lifting
up
his
hand
to
heaven
he
said
am
your
master
odysseus
after
twenty
years
i
have
come
back
to
my
own
country
and
i
find
that
of
all
my
servants
by
you
two
alone
is
my
homecoming
desired
if
you
need
see
a
token
that
i
am
indeed
odysseus
look
down
on
my
foot
see
there
the
mark
that
the
wild
boar
left
on
me
in
the
days
of
my
youth
straightway
he
drew
the
rags
from
the
scar
and
the
swineherd
and
the
cattleherd
saw
it
and
marked
it
well
knowing
that
it
was
indeed
odysseus
who
stood
before
them
they
cast
their
arms
around
him
and
kissed
him
on
the
head
and
shoulders
and
odysseus
was
moved
by
their
tears
and
he
kissed
their
heads
and
their
hands
as
they
went
back
to
the
hall
he
told
eum√¶us
to
bring
the
bow
to
him
as
he
was
bearing
it
through
the
hall
he
told
him
too
to
order
eurycleia
the
faithful
nurse
to
bar
the
doors
of
the
women
apartment
at
the
end
of
the
hall
and
to
bid
the
women
even
if
they
heard
a
groaning
and
a
din
not
to
come
into
the
hall
and
he
charged
the
cattleherd
phil≈ìtius
to
bar
the
gates
of
the
courtyard
as
he
went
into
the
hall
one
of
the
wooers
eurymachus
was
striving
to
bend
the
bow
as
he
struggled
to
do
so
he
groaned
aloud
because
i
may
not
marry
penelope
do
i
groan
but
because
we
youths
of
are
shown
to
be
weaklings
beside
odysseus
whose
bow
we
can
in
no
way
bend
then
antinous
the
proudest
of
the
wooers
made
answer
and
said
should
we
strive
to
bend
the
bow
nay
lay
the
bow
aside
eurymachus
and
let
the
pour
us
out
a
cupful
each
in
the
morning
let
us
make
sacrifice
to
the
and
pray
that
the
bow
be
fitted
to
some
of
our
hands
then
odysseus
came
forward
and
said
you
do
well
to
lay
the
bow
aside
for
but
will
you
not
put
the
bow
into
my
hands
that
i
may
try
to
bend
it
and
judge
for
myself
whether
i
have
any
of
the
strength
that
once
was
mine
all
the
wooers
were
angry
that
a
seeming
beggar
should
attempt
to
bend
the
bow
that
none
of
their
company
were
able
to
bend
antinous
spoke
to
him
sharply
and
said
wretched
beggar
is
it
not
enough
that
thou
art
let
into
this
high
hall
to
pick
up
scraps
but
thou
must
listen
to
our
speech
and
join
in
our
conversation
if
thou
shouldst
bend
that
bow
we
will
make
short
shrift
of
thee
i
promise
we
will
put
thee
on
a
ship
and
send
thee
over
to
king
echetus
who
will
cut
thee
to
pieces
and
give
thy
flesh
to
his
hounds
old
eum√¶us
had
taken
up
the
bow
as
he
went
with
it
to
odysseus
some
of
them
shouted
to
him
art
thou
going
with
the
bow
thou
crazy
fellow
put
it
down
eum√¶us
was
confused
by
their
shouts
and
he
put
down
the
bow
then
telemachus
spoke
to
him
and
said
beware
of
being
the
man
who
served
many
masters
eum√¶us
hearing
these
words
took
it
up
again
and
brought
it
to
odysseus
and
put
the
bow
into
his
hands
as
odysseus
stood
in
the
doorway
of
the
hall
the
bow
in
his
hands
and
with
the
arrows
scattered
at
his
feet
eum√¶us
went
to
eurycleia
and
told
her
to
bar
the
door
of
the
women
apartment
at
the
back
then
phil≈ìtius
the
cattleherd
went
out
of
the
hall
and
barred
the
gates
leading
out
of
the
courtyard
for
long
odysseus
stood
with
the
bow
in
his
hands
handling
it
as
a
minstrel
handles
a
lyre
when
he
stretches
a
cord
or
tightens
a
peg
then
he
bent
the
great
bow
he
bent
it
without
an
effort
and
at
his
touch
the
made
a
sound
that
was
like
the
cry
of
a
swallow
the
wooers
seeing
him
bend
that
mighty
bow
felt
every
man
of
them
a
sharp
pain
at
the
heart
they
saw
odysseus
take
up
an
arrow
and
fit
it
to
the
string
he
held
the
notch
and
he
drew
the
string
and
he
shot
the
arrow
straight
through
the
holes
in
the
back
of
the
then
as
eum√¶us
took
up
the
axes
and
brought
them
outside
he
said
seest
lord
telemachus
that
thy
guest
does
not
shame
thee
through
foolish
boasting
i
have
bent
the
bow
of
odysseus
and
i
have
shot
the
arrow
aright
but
now
it
is
time
to
provide
the
feast
for
the
lords
who
woo
thy
lady
mother
while
it
is
yet
light
the
feast
must
be
served
to
them
and
with
the
feast
they
must
have
music
and
the
dance
illustration
saying
this
he
nodded
to
telemachus
bending
his
terrible
brows
telemachus
instantly
girt
his
sword
upon
him
and
took
his
spear
in
his
hand
outside
was
heard
the
thunder
of
zeus
and
now
odysseus
had
stripped
his
rags
from
him
and
was
standing
upright
looking
a
master
of
men
the
mighty
bow
was
in
his
hands
and
at
his
feet
were
scattered
many
arrows
xv
it
is
ended
odysseus
said
trial
is
ended
now
will
i
have
another
mark
saying
this
he
put
the
arrow
against
the
string
of
the
bow
and
shot
at
the
first
of
his
enemies
it
was
at
antinous
he
pointed
the
arrow
at
antinous
who
was
even
then
lifting
up
a
golden
cup
filled
with
wine
and
who
was
smiling
with
death
far
from
his
thoughts
odysseus
aimed
at
him
and
smote
him
with
the
arrow
in
the
throat
and
the
point
passed
out
clean
through
his
neck
the
wine
cup
fell
from
his
hands
and
antinous
fell
dead
across
the
table
then
did
all
the
wooers
raise
a
shout
threatening
odysseus
for
sending
an
arrow
astray
it
did
not
come
into
their
minds
that
this
had
aimed
to
kill
antinous
but
odysseus
shouted
back
to
them
dogs
ye
that
said
in
your
hearts
that
odysseus
would
never
return
to
his
home
ye
that
wasted
my
substance
and
troubled
my
wife
and
injured
my
servants
ye
who
showed
no
fear
of
heaven
nor
of
the
just
judgements
of
men
behold
odysseus
returned
and
know
what
death
is
being
loosed
on
you
then
eurymachus
shouted
out
this
man
will
not
hold
his
hands
nor
cease
from
shooting
with
the
bow
until
all
of
us
are
slain
now
must
we
enter
into
the
battle
with
him
draw
your
swords
and
hold
up
the
tables
before
you
for
shields
and
advance
upon
him
but
even
as
he
spoke
odysseus
with
a
terrible
cry
loosed
an
arrow
at
him
and
shot
eurymachus
through
the
breast
he
let
the
sword
fall
from
his
hand
and
he
too
fell
dead
upon
the
floor
one
of
the
band
rushed
straight
at
odysseus
with
his
sword
in
hand
but
telemachus
was
at
hand
and
he
drove
his
spear
through
this
shoulders
then
telemachus
ran
quickly
to
a
chamber
where
there
were
weapons
and
armour
lying
the
swineherd
and
the
cattleherd
joined
him
and
all
three
put
armour
upon
them
odysseus
as
long
as
he
had
arrows
to
defend
himself
kept
shooting
at
and
smiting
the
wooers
when
all
the
arrows
were
gone
he
put
the
helmet
on
his
head
and
took
up
the
shield
that
telemachus
had
brought
and
the
two
great
spears
but
now
melanthius
the
goatherd
he
who
was
the
enemy
of
odysseus
got
into
the
chamber
where
the
arms
were
kept
and
brought
out
spears
and
shields
and
helmets
and
gave
them
to
the
wooers
seeing
the
goatherd
go
back
for
more
arms
telemachus
and
eum√¶us
dashed
into
the
chamber
and
caught
him
and
bound
him
with
a
rope
and
dragged
him
up
near
the
and
left
him
hanging
there
then
they
closed
and
bolted
the
door
and
stood
on
guard
many
of
the
wooers
lay
dead
upon
the
floor
of
the
hall
now
one
who
was
called
agelaus
stood
forward
and
directed
the
wooers
to
cast
spears
at
odysseus
but
not
one
of
the
spears
they
cast
struck
him
for
odysseus
was
able
to
avoid
them
all
and
now
he
directed
telemachus
and
eum√¶us
and
phil≈ìtius
to
cast
their
spears
when
they
cast
them
with
odysseus
each
one
struck
a
man
and
four
of
the
wooers
fell
down
and
again
odysseus
directed
his
following
to
cast
their
spears
and
again
they
cast
them
and
slew
their
men
they
drove
those
who
remained
from
one
end
of
the
hall
to
the
other
and
slew
them
all
straightway
the
doors
of
the
women
apartment
were
flung
open
and
eurycleia
appeared
she
saw
odysseus
amongst
the
bodies
of
the
dead
all
stained
with
blood
she
would
have
cried
out
in
triumph
if
odysseus
had
not
restrained
her
within
thine
own
heart
he
said
do
not
cry
aloud
for
it
is
an
unholy
thing
to
triumph
over
men
lying
dead
these
men
the
gods
themselves
have
overcome
because
of
their
own
hard
and
unjust
hearts
as
he
spoke
the
women
came
out
of
their
chambers
carrying
torches
in
their
hands
they
fell
upon
odysseus
and
embraced
him
and
clasped
and
kissed
his
hands
a
longing
came
over
him
to
weep
for
he
remembered
them
from
of
old
every
one
of
the
servants
who
were
there
illustration
xvi
eurycleia
the
old
nurse
went
to
the
upper
chamber
where
penelope
lay
in
her
bed
she
bent
over
her
and
called
out
penelope
dear
child
come
down
and
see
with
thine
own
eyes
what
hath
happened
the
wooers
are
overthrown
and
he
whom
thou
hast
ever
longed
to
see
hath
come
back
odysseus
thy
husband
hath
returned
he
hath
slain
the
proud
wooers
who
have
troubled
thee
for
so
long
but
penelope
only
looked
at
the
nurse
for
she
thought
that
her
brain
had
been
turned
still
eurycleia
kept
on
saying
very
deed
odysseus
is
here
he
is
that
guest
whom
all
the
wooers
dishonour
in
the
hall
then
hearing
eurycleia
say
these
words
penelope
sprang
out
of
bed
and
put
her
arms
round
the
nurse
neck
tell
me
if
what
thou
dost
say
be
true
tell
me
how
this
stranger
slew
the
wooers
who
were
so
many
did
not
see
the
slaying
eurycleia
said
i
heard
the
groaning
of
the
men
as
they
were
slain
and
then
i
found
odysseus
standing
amongst
many
dead
men
and
it
comforted
my
heart
to
see
him
standing
there
like
a
lion
aroused
come
with
me
now
lady
that
you
may
both
enter
into
your
heart
delight
you
that
have
suffered
so
much
of
affliction
thy
lord
hath
come
alive
to
his
own
hearth
and
he
hath
found
his
wife
and
his
son
alive
and
well
no
said
penelope
no
odysseus
hath
not
returned
he
who
hath
slain
the
wooers
is
one
of
the
deathless
gods
come
down
to
punish
them
for
their
injustice
and
their
hardheartedness
odysseus
long
ago
lost
the
way
of
his
returning
and
he
is
lying
dead
in
some
land
no
said
eurycleia
can
show
thee
that
it
is
odysseus
indeed
who
is
in
the
hall
on
his
foot
is
the
scar
that
the
tusk
of
a
boar
gave
him
in
the
old
days
i
spied
it
when
i
was
washing
his
feet
last
night
and
i
would
have
told
thee
of
it
but
he
clapped
a
hand
across
my
mouth
to
stop
my
speech
lo
i
stake
my
life
that
it
is
odysseus
and
none
other
who
is
in
the
hall
below
saying
this
she
took
penelope
by
the
hand
and
led
her
from
the
upper
chamber
into
the
hall
odysseus
was
standing
by
a
tall
pillar
he
waited
there
for
his
wife
to
come
and
speak
to
him
but
penelope
stood
still
and
gazed
long
upon
him
and
made
no
step
towards
him
then
said
telemachus
can
it
be
that
thy
heart
is
so
hard
here
is
my
father
and
thou
wilt
not
go
to
him
nor
question
him
at
all
said
penelope
mind
is
amazed
and
i
have
no
strength
to
speak
nor
to
ask
him
aught
nor
even
to
look
on
him
face
to
face
if
this
is
indeed
odysseus
who
hath
come
home
a
place
has
to
be
prepared
for
him
illustration
then
odysseus
spoke
to
telemachus
and
said
now
to
the
bath
and
make
thyself
clean
of
the
stains
of
battle
i
will
stay
and
speak
with
thy
lady
mother
lady
said
he
to
penelope
thy
heart
indeed
so
hard
no
other
woman
in
the
world
i
think
would
stand
so
aloof
from
her
husband
who
after
so
much
toil
and
so
many
trials
has
come
back
after
twenty
years
to
his
own
hearth
is
there
no
place
for
me
here
and
must
i
again
sleep
in
the
stranger
bed
said
penelope
no
stranger
bed
wilt
thou
lie
my
lord
come
eurycleia
set
up
for
him
his
own
bedstead
outside
his
then
odysseus
said
to
her
speaking
in
anger
comes
it
that
my
bed
can
be
moved
to
this
place
and
that
not
a
bed
of
that
kind
was
the
bed
i
built
for
myself
knowest
thou
not
how
i
built
my
bed
first
there
grew
up
in
the
courtyard
an
olive
tree
round
that
olive
tree
i
built
a
chamber
and
i
roofed
it
well
and
i
set
doors
to
it
then
i
sheared
off
all
the
light
wood
on
the
growing
olive
tree
and
i
the
trunk
with
the
adze
and
i
made
the
tree
into
a
bed
post
beginning
with
this
bed
post
i
wrought
a
bedstead
and
when
i
finished
it
i
inlaid
it
with
silver
and
ivory
such
was
the
bed
i
built
for
myself
and
such
a
bed
could
not
be
moved
to
this
place
or
that
then
did
penelope
know
assuredly
that
the
man
who
stood
before
her
was
indeed
her
husband
the
steadfast
odysseus
none
other
knew
of
where
the
bed
was
placed
and
how
it
had
been
built
penelope
fell
and
she
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
odysseus
my
lord
she
said
not
angry
with
thy
wife
always
the
fear
was
in
my
heart
that
some
guileful
stranger
should
come
here
professing
to
be
odysseus
and
that
i
should
take
him
to
me
as
my
husband
how
terrible
such
a
thing
would
be
but
now
my
heart
is
freed
from
all
doubts
be
not
angry
with
me
odysseus
for
not
throwing
myself
on
thy
neck
as
the
women
of
the
house
did
then
husband
and
wife
wept
together
and
penelope
said
was
the
gods
did
this
to
us
odysseus
the
gods
who
grudged
that
we
should
have
joy
of
the
days
of
our
youth
next
they
told
each
other
of
things
that
happened
in
the
twenty
years
they
were
apart
odysseus
speaking
of
his
own
toils
and
sorrows
and
penelope
telling
what
she
had
endured
at
the
hands
of
the
wooers
and
as
they
told
tales
one
to
the
other
slumber
came
upon
them
and
the
dawn
found
them
sleeping
side
by
side
xvii
and
still
many
dangers
had
to
be
faced
the
wooers
whom
odysseus
had
slain
were
the
richest
and
the
most
powerful
of
the
lords
of
ithaka
and
the
islands
all
of
them
had
fathers
and
brothers
who
would
fain
avenge
them
upon
their
slayer
now
before
anyone
in
the
city
knew
that
he
had
returned
odysseus
went
forth
to
the
farm
that
laertes
his
old
father
stayed
at
as
he
drew
near
he
saw
an
old
man
working
in
the
vineyard
digging
round
a
plant
when
he
came
to
him
he
saw
that
this
old
man
was
not
a
slave
nor
a
servant
but
laertes
his
own
father
when
he
saw
him
wasted
with
age
and
all
uncared
for
odysseus
stood
still
leaning
his
hand
against
a
pear
tree
and
sorrowing
in
his
heart
old
laertes
kept
his
head
down
as
he
stood
digging
at
the
plant
and
he
did
not
see
odysseus
until
he
stood
before
him
and
said
man
thou
dost
care
for
this
garden
well
and
all
things
here
are
flourishing
fig
tree
and
vine
and
olive
and
pear
but
if
a
stranger
may
say
it
thine
own
self
is
not
cared
for
well
art
thou
that
dost
speak
to
me
like
this
old
laertes
said
lifting
his
head
am
a
stranger
in
ithaka
said
odysseus
seek
a
man
whom
i
once
kindly
treated
a
man
whose
name
was
odysseus
a
stranger
he
came
to
me
and
he
declared
that
he
was
of
ithaka
and
that
one
day
he
would
give
me
entertainment
for
the
entertainment
i
had
given
him
i
know
not
if
this
man
be
still
alive
old
laertes
wept
before
odysseus
said
he
thou
hadst
been
able
to
find
him
here
the
gifts
you
gave
him
would
not
have
been
bestowed
in
vain
true
hospitality
thou
wouldst
have
received
from
odysseus
my
son
but
he
has
perished
far
from
his
country
soil
he
has
perished
the
hapless
man
and
his
mother
wept
not
over
him
nor
his
wife
nor
me
his
father
illustration
so
he
spake
and
then
with
his
hands
he
took
up
the
dust
of
the
ground
and
he
strewed
it
over
his
head
in
his
sorrow
the
heart
of
odysseus
was
moved
with
grief
he
sprang
forward
and
fell
on
his
father
neck
and
he
kissed
him
saying
i
am
here
even
i
my
father
i
odysseus
have
come
back
to
mine
own
country
cease
thy
lamentation
until
i
tell
thee
of
the
things
that
have
happened
i
have
slain
the
wooers
in
mine
hall
and
i
have
avenged
all
their
injuries
and
all
their
wrongful
doings
dost
thou
not
believe
this
my
father
then
look
on
what
i
will
show
thee
behold
on
my
foot
the
mark
of
the
boar
tusk
there
it
is
from
the
days
of
my
youth
laertes
looked
down
on
the
bare
foot
and
he
saw
the
scar
but
still
his
mind
was
clouded
by
doubt
but
then
odysseus
took
him
through
the
garden
and
he
told
him
of
the
fruit
trees
that
laertes
had
set
for
him
when
he
odysseus
was
a
little
child
following
his
father
about
the
garden
thirteen
pear
trees
and
ten
apple
trees
and
forty
fig
trees
when
odysseus
showed
him
these
laertes
knew
that
it
was
his
son
indeed
who
stood
before
him
his
son
come
back
after
twenty
years
wandering
he
cast
his
arms
around
his
neck
and
odysseus
caught
him
fainting
to
his
breast
and
led
him
into
the
house
within
the
house
were
telemachus
and
eum√¶us
the
swineherd
and
phil≈ìtius
the
cattleherd
they
all
clasped
the
hand
of
laertes
and
their
words
raised
his
spirits
then
he
was
bathed
and
when
he
came
from
the
bath
rubbed
with
olive
oil
he
looked
hale
and
strong
odysseus
said
to
him
surely
one
of
the
gods
has
made
thee
goodlier
and
greater
than
thou
wert
a
while
ago
said
the
old
hero
laertes
my
son
would
that
i
had
such
might
as
when
long
before
thou
wert
born
i
took
the
castle
of
nericus
there
upon
the
foreland
would
that
in
such
might
and
with
such
mail
upon
my
shoulders
i
stood
with
thee
yesterday
when
thou
didst
fight
with
the
wooers
while
they
were
speaking
in
this
way
the
rumour
of
the
slaying
of
the
wooers
went
through
the
city
then
those
who
were
related
to
the
men
slain
went
into
the
courtyard
of
odysseus
house
and
brought
forth
the
bodies
those
who
belonged
to
ithaka
they
buried
and
those
who
belonged
to
the
islands
they
put
upon
ships
and
sent
them
with
fisherfolk
each
to
his
own
home
many
were
wroth
with
odysseus
for
the
slaying
of
a
friend
he
who
was
the
most
wroth
was
eupeithes
the
father
of
antinous
there
was
an
assembly
of
the
men
of
the
country
and
eupeithes
spake
in
it
and
all
who
were
there
pitied
him
he
told
how
odysseus
had
led
away
the
best
of
the
men
of
ithaka
and
how
he
had
lost
them
in
his
ships
and
he
told
them
how
when
he
returned
he
slew
the
noblest
of
the
men
of
ithaka
and
the
islands
in
his
own
hall
he
called
upon
them
to
slay
odysseus
saying
we
avenge
not
ourselves
on
the
slayer
of
our
kin
we
will
be
scorned
for
all
time
as
weak
and
cowardly
men
as
for
me
life
will
be
no
more
sweet
to
me
i
would
rather
die
straightway
and
be
with
the
departed
up
now
and
let
us
attack
odysseus
and
his
followers
before
they
take
ship
and
escape
across
the
sea
many
in
that
assembly
put
on
their
armour
and
went
out
with
old
eupeithes
and
as
they
went
through
the
town
they
met
with
odysseus
and
his
following
as
they
were
coming
from
the
house
of
laertes
now
as
the
two
bands
came
close
to
each
other
odysseus
with
telemachus
and
laertes
with
the
swineherd
and
the
cattleherd
with
dolius
laertes
servant
and
with
the
six
sons
of
dolius
and
eupeithes
with
his
friends
a
great
figure
came
between
it
was
the
figure
of
a
tall
fair
and
splendid
woman
odysseus
knew
her
for
the
goddess
pallas
athene
your
hands
from
fierce
fighting
ye
men
of
ithaka
the
goddess
called
out
in
a
terrible
voice
your
hands
straightway
the
arms
fell
from
each
man
hands
then
the
goddess
called
them
together
and
she
made
them
enter
into
a
covenant
that
all
bloodshed
and
wrong
would
be
forgotten
and
that
odysseus
would
be
left
to
rule
ithaka
as
a
king
in
peace
illustration
so
ends
the
story
of
odysseus
who
went
with
king
agamemnon
to
the
wars
of
troy
who
made
the
plan
of
the
wooden
horse
by
which
priam
city
was
taken
at
last
who
missed
the
way
of
his
return
and
came
to
the
land
of
the
who
came
to
the
country
of
the
dread
cycl√¥pes
to
the
island
of
√¶olus
and
to
the
house
of
circe
the
enchantress
who
heard
the
song
of
the
sirens
and
came
to
the
rocks
wandering
and
to
the
terrible
charybdis
and
to
scylla
past
whom
no
other
man
had
won
scatheless
who
landed
on
the
island
where
the
cattle
of
the
sun
grazed
and
who
stayed
upon
ogygia
the
home
of
the
nymph
calypso
so
ends
the
story
of
odysseus
who
would
have
been
made
deathless
and
ageless
by
calypso
if
he
had
not
yearned
always
to
come
back
to
his
own
hearth
and
his
own
land
and
spite
of
all
his
troubles
and
his
toils
he
was
fortunate
for
he
found
a
constant
wife
and
a
dutiful
son
and
a
father
still
alive
to
weep
over
him
