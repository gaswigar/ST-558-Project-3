introduction
as
i
sat
one
evening
idly
musing
on
memories
of
roers
and
boers
and
contemplating
the
horns
of
a
weendigo
i
had
shot
in
labrador
and
the
head
of
a
moo
cow
from
canada
i
was
roused
by
a
ring
at
the
door
bell
a
literary
friend
to
whom
i
have
shown
your
says
a
weendigo
is
ojibbeway
for
a
cannibal
and
why
do
you
shoot
poor
moo
cows
publisher
mere
slip

moose
literary
gent
no
ed
all
publisher
the
presently
entered
bearing
a
huge
parcel
which
had
just
arrived
by
post
i
opened
it
with
all
the
excitement
that
an
unexpected
parcel
can
cause
and
murmured
like
thackeray
perhaps
mumm
i
hope
it
was
a
mummy
case
by
jingo
this
was
no
common
or
museum
mummy
case
the
lid
with
the
gilded
mask
was
absent
and
the
under
half
or
lower
segment
painted
all
over
with
hieroglyphics
of
an
unusual
type
and
in
colour
had
obviously
been
used
as
a
cradle
for
unconscious
infancy
a
baby
had
slept
in
the
last
of
the
dead
what
an
opportunity
for
the
moralist
but
i
am
not
a
collector
of
cradles
who
had
sent
it
and
why
the
question
was
settled
by
an
envelope
in
a
feminine
hand
which
with
a
cylindrical
packet
fell
out
of
the
mummy
case
and
contained
a
letter
running
as
follows
betty
dear
sir
you
have
not
forgotten
me
and
my
friend
leonora
mummy
case
which
encloses
this
document
is
the
cradle
of
her
ancient
are
for
reasons
you
will
discover
in
the
accompanying
manuscript
about
to
start
for
treasure
island
where
if
anywhere
in
this
earth
ready
money
is
to
be
found
on
easy
terms
of
personal
insecurity
confound
it
i
cried
another
fiend
of
a
woman
sending
me
another
manuscript
they
are
always
at
it
wants
to
get
it
into
a
magazine
as
usual
and
my
guess
was
correct
the
letter
went
on
who
are
so
well
known
will
have
no
difficulty
in
getting
the
editor
of
the
nineteenth
century
or
the
quarterly
review
or
bow
bells
to
accept
my
little
contribution
i
shall
be
glad
to
hear
what
remuneration
i
am
to
expect
and
cheques
may
be
forwarded
very
truly
martin
mummy
case
is
very
valuable
please
deposit
it
at
the
old
bank
in
the
high
where
it
will
represent
my
now
i
get
letters
like
this
not
usually
escorted
by
a
mummy
case
about
thrice
a
day
and
a
pretty
sum
it
costs
me
in
stamps
to
send
back
the
rubbish
to
the
amateur
authors
but
how
could
i
send
back
a
manuscript
to
a
lady
already
on
her
way
to
treasure
island
here
perhaps
i
should
explain
how
mary
martin
as
she
signed
herself
came
to
choose
for
her
literary
agent
to
be
sure
total
strangers
are
always
sending
me
their
manuscripts
but
martin
had
actually
been
introduced
to
me
years
before
i
was
staying
as
it
happened
at
one
of
our
university
towns
which
i
shall
call
oxford
for
short
not
that
that
was
its
name
walking
one
day
with
a
niece
a
scholar
of
lady
betty
hall
we
chanced
to
meet
in
the
high
two
rather
remarkable
persons
one
of
them
was
the
very
prettiest
girl
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
her
noble
frame
marked
her
as
the
victor
over
girton
at
while
her
indicated
the
student
she
reminded
me
in
the
grace
of
her
movements
of
the
artemis
of
the
louvre
and
the
psyche
of
naples
while
her
thoughtful
expression
recalled
the
celebrated
girl
of
donatello
only
a
reading
girl
indeed
could
have
been
as
she
was
reader
in
english
literature
on
the
churton
collins
foundation
is
she
i
said
to
my
friend
the
scholar
of
lady
betty
a
lovely
creature
she
is
she
replied
with
some
tartness
what
you
can
see
in
do
know
that
leonora
and
the
lady
with
her
is
the
lady
superior
of
lady
betty
call
them
pretty
and
the
proctor
my
friend
went
on
martin
polly
they
call
her
too
has
been
proctor
twice
i
say
you
know
keep
clear
of
improbabilities
no
one
was
ever
old
enough
to
have
been
proctor
publisher
that
all
you
know
about
it
why
i
shall
bring
in
a
character
old
enough
to
have
been
proctor
a
thousand
ed
now
nobody
could
have
called
polly
bewitching
her
age
must
really
have
been
quite
i
dislike
dwelling
on
this
topic
but
she
was
short
dumpy
wore
blue
spectacles
a
green
umbrella
a
red
and
black
shawl
worsted
mittens
and
uncompromising
boots
she
had
also
the
ringlets
and
other
attractions
with
which
french
art
adorns
its
ideal
englishwoman
at
my
request
i
was
introduced
but
presently
some
thirty
professors
six
or
seven
senior
dons
and
a
sprinkling
of
heads
of
houses
in
red
and
black
sleeves
came
bounding
out
of
university
sermon
and
gathered
round
the
lovely
leonora
the
master
of
catherine
was
accompanied
by
a
hitherto
unattached
student
who
manifestly
at
once
fell
a
victim
to
leonora
charms
this
youth
was
of
peculiar
aspect
he
was
a
member
of
the
nearly
extinct
boshman
tribe
of
kokoatinaland
his
long
silky
hair
originally
black
had
been
blanched
to
a
permanent
and
snowy
white
by
failures
in
the
attempt
to
matriculate
at
balliol
he
was
short
not
above
four
feet
nine
and
was
tattooed
all
over
his
dark
but
intelligent
features
when
he
was
introduced
i
had
my
first
opportunity
of
admiring
extraordinary
knowledge
of
native
customs
and
etiquette
me
present
to
you
said
the
master
of
catherine
boshman
chief
ustâni
me
answered
leonora
with
a
smile
that
captivated
the
boshman
it
is
a
rule
among
the
tribes
of
kokoatinaland
and
in
africa
generally
to
greet
a
new
acquaintance
with
a
verbal
play
on
his
name
owing
to
our
insular
ignorance
and
the
difficulty
of
the
task
this
courtesy
had
been
omitted
at
oxford
in
ustâni
case
even
by
the
professors
of
comparative
philology
and
the
learned
keeper
of
the
museum
from
that
hour
to
another
which
struck
later
when
struck
too
ustâni
was
leonora
slave
is
this
publisher
all
right
see
ayesha
elegant
pun
on
holly
it
always
done
pun
i
ed
i
had
no
further
opportunity
of
conversing
with
leonora
and
polly
nor
indeed
did
i
ever
think
of
them
again
till
polly
letter
and
mummy
case
recalled
them
to
my
memory
perhaps
for
pretty
leonora
sake
i
did
after
all
take
up
and
open
the
vast
cylindrical
roll
of
in
the
mummy
case
dawn
found
me
still
reading
the
following
record
of
unparalleled
adventure
do
you
think
it
would
stand
being
cut
a
little
publisher
we
shall
ed
there
is
just
one
thing
that
puzzles
me
polly
and
leonora
have
gone
no
man
knows
where
and
taking
everything
into
consideration
it
may
be
a
good
two
thousand
years
before
they
come
back
ought
i
not
then
to
invest
my
own
the
princely
cheque
of
the
intelligent
publishers
ed
chapter
ii
polly
narrative
i
am
the
plainest
woman
in
england
bar
none
even
in
youth
i
was
not
strictly
speaking
voluptuously
lovely
short
stumpy
with
a
fringe
like
the
thatch
of
a
newly
evicted
cottage
such
was
my
appearance
at
twenty
and
such
it
remains
like
cain
i
was
branded
but
enough
of
personalities
i
had
in
youth
but
one
friend
a
lady
of
kingly
descent
the
kings
to
be
sure
were
irish
and
of
bewitching
loveliness
when
she
rushed
into
my
lonely
rooms
one
wild
winter
night
with
a
cradle
in
her
arms
and
a
baby
in
the
cradle
when
she
besought
me
to
teach
that
infant
hittite
hebrew
and
the
differential
calculus
and
to
bring
it
up
in
college
on
commons
where
the
air
is
salubrious
what
could
i
do
but
acquiesce
it
is
unusual
i
know
for
a
student
of
my
sex
however
learned
to
educate
an
infant
in
college
and
bring
her
up
on
commons
but
for
once
the
uncompromising
nature
of
my
charms
strangled
the
breath
of
scandal
in
the
bud
and
little
leonora
became
the
darling
of
the
university
the
old
keeper
of
the
bodleian
was
a
crusty
bachelor
who
liked
nothing
young
but
calf
and
preferred
morocco
to
but
even
loved
leonora
one
night
the
little
girl
was
lost
and
only
after
looking
for
her
in
the
hebdomadal
boardroom
in
the
sheldonian
the
pusaeum
and
all
the
barges
did
we
find
that
unprincipled
old
man
amusing
her
by
letting
off
crackers
and
among
the
mexican
mss
in
the
bodleian
i
may
as
well
say
at
once
that
i
be
responsible
for
polly
style
sometimes
it
is
flat
they
tell
me
and
sometimes
it
is
flamboyant
whatever
they
may
mean
it
is
never
the
least
like
what
one
would
expect
an
elderly
lady
don
or
donna
to
ed
see
mark
of
arrowsmith
an
excellent
ed
is
this
not
rolling
publisher
these
were
halcyon
hours
happier
as
leonora
grew
up
and
received
the
education
prescribed
for
her
by
her
parent
her
hebrew
was
fair
and
her
hittite
up
to
a
first
class
but
to
my
distress
she
mainly
devoted
herself
to
celtic
studies
i
should
tell
you
that
leonora
chief
interest
in
life
was
the
decipherment
of
the
inscriptions
on
her
cradle
the
mummy
case
which
had
rocked
her
ancestors
since
abraham
time
and
which
is
now
in
your
possession
of
itself
it
is
a
sufficient
proof
of
the
accuracy
of
this
narrative
the
mummy
case
is
not
the
ordinary
coffin
of
egyptian
commerce
the
hieroglyphics
have
baffled
isaac
taylor
and
have
been
variously
construed
as
chinese
etruscan
and
basque
by
the
various
professors
of
these
learned
lingoes
do
you
think
this
bit
is
a
little
dull
the
public
care
about
dead
publisher
story
ca
possibly
get
on
without
it
as
you
see
you
have
something
of
this
sort
in
a
romance
look
at
cypher
in
the
and
the
chart
in
and
the
portuguee
scroll
in
ed
now
about
this
mummy
case
you
must
know
that
it
had
been
in
family
ever
since
her
ancestress
theodolitê
pharaoh
daughter
left
egypt
not
knowing
when
she
was
well
off
and
settled
in
ireland
of
all
places
where
she
founded
the
national
prosperity
is
not
a
little
steep
publisher
no
it
is
in
all
the
irish
histories
see
lady
legends
of
if
you
do
believe
ed
the
mummy
case
and
a
queer
ring
see
cover
inscribed
with
a
duck
a
duck
egg
and
an
umbrella
were
about
all
that
the
kept
of
their
ancient
property
the
older
leonora
grew
the
more
deeply
she
studied
the
inscriptions
on
the
mummy
case
she
tried
it
as
zend
she
tried
it
as
sanskrit
and
japanese
and
the
american
language
and
finally
she
tried
it
as
irish
we
had
a
very
rainy
season
that
winter
even
for
oxford
and
the
more
it
rained
the
more
leonora
pored
over
that
mummy
case
i
kept
telling
her
there
was
nothing
in
it
but
she
would
not
listen
to
me
chapter
iii
leonora
discovery
one
wild
winter
night
when
the
sleet
lashed
the
pane
my
door
suddenly
opened
i
started
out
of
a
slumber
and
could
i
believe
my
eyes
can
history
repeat
itself
there
stood
the
friend
of
my
early
youth
her
eyes
ablaze
a
cradle
in
her
arms
was
it
all
coming
round
again
a
moment
reflection
showed
me
that
it
was
my
early
friend
but
her
daughter
leonora
i
screamed
tell
me
that
have
deciphered
the
inscription
said
the
girl
proudly
setting
down
the
cradle
the
baby
had
come
round
is
all
i
replied
have
a
squint
at
it
in
my
case
no
mere
figure
of
speech
do
you
call
said
leonora
handing
me
the
accompanying
document
illustration
call
it
pie
said
i
using
a
technical
term
of
typography
make
head
or
tail
of
it
i
said
peevishly
pie
or
no
pie
i
love
it
like
pie
and
i
broken
the
crust
answered
the
girl
to
my
interpretation
which
i
can
not
mistrust
i
asked
she
answered
and
the
response
seemed
sufficient
when
mixed
with
her
bright
smile
runs
thus
she
resumed
with
severity
the
only
language
can
partially
understand
runs
thus
she
reiterated
and
i
could
not
help
saying
under
such
breath
as
i
had
left
running
a
long
time
now
she
frowned
and
read
theodolitê
daughter
of
a
race
that
has
never
been
run
out
did
to
the
magician
jambres
whose
skill
was
even
as
the
skill
of
the
gods
those
things
which
as
you
have
not
yet
heard
i
shall
now
proceed
to
relate
to
you
him
i
say
was
i
jealous
for
that
he
loved
a
maiden
inferior
oh
how
inferior
to
me
in
charms
wit
beauty
intellect
stature
girth
and
ancestry
therefore
being
well
assured
of
this
i
made
the
man
into
a
mummy
ere
ever
his
living
spirit
had
left
him
what
arts
i
used
to
this
last
purpose
it
boots
not
nor
do
i
choose
to
tell
when
i
had
done
this
thing
i
put
him
secretly
away
in
a
fitting
box
even
as
set
concealed
osiris
then
came
my
maidens
and
tidied
him
away
as
is
the
wont
of
these
accursed
ones
from
that
hour
even
until
now
has
no
man
nor
woman
known
where
to
find
him
even
jambres
the
magician
for
though
the
mummifying
as
thou
shalt
not
fail
to
discover
was
in
some
sort
incomplete
yet
the
tidying
away
and
the
losing
were
so
complete
that
no
putting
forth
of
precious
papyri
into
cupboards
beneath
flights
of
stairs
has
ever
equalled
it
therefore
shall
i
curse
these
maidens
even
in
amenti
the
place
of
their
tormenting
them
may
they
be
eternally
forgotten
them
up
and
down
through
the
whole
solar
system
is
very
violent
language
my
dear
said
i
people
swore
terribly
in
egypt
answered
leonora
calmly
it
is
vain
no
woman
can
curse
worth
a
from
the
use
of
the
word
i
conjecture
that
leonora
ancestress
lived
under
the
persian
empire
there
or
m
for
this
the
losing
of
the
one
whom
i
mummied
must
i
suffer
countless
penalties
for
i
even
the
seeress
know
not
what
the
said
maidens
did
with
the
said
mummy
nor
do
you
know
nor
any
other
and
not
to
know
for
i
want
my
mummy
to
have
a
good
cry
over
is
great
part
of
my
punishment
but
this
i
the
seeress
do
know
right
well
for
it
was
revealed
to
me
in
a
dream
and
this
i
do
prophesy
unto
thee
my
daughter
or
daughter
daughter
ay
this
do
i
say
that
a
curse
will
rest
upon
me
until
he
who
was
mummied
shall
be
found
this
also
do
i
the
seeress
tell
thee
he
who
was
mummified
shall
be
found
in
the
dark
country
where
there
is
no
sun
and
men
breathe
the
vapour
of
smoke
and
light
lamps
at
noonday
and
wire
themselves
even
with
wires
when
the
wind
bloweth
and
the
place
where
the
mummy
dwelleth
is
beneath
the
three
balls
of
gold
and
one
will
lead
thee
thither
who
abides
hard
by
the
great
tree
carven
like
the
head
of
an
ethiopian
and
thou
shalt
come
to
the
people
who
slate
strangers
and
to
the
place
of
the
rolling
of
logs
and
the
music
thereof
shalt
thou
find
him
even
jambres
and
when
thou
hast
healed
him
the
curse
shall
fall
from
me
indeed
shall
the
unmummying
be
accomplished
even
then
unless
thou
o
my
daughter
or
my
daughter
daughter
as
before
shalt
go
with
to
the
hall
of
egyptian
darkness
and
sit
in
the
wizard
chair
that
is
thereby
even
the
seat
which
was
erst
the
siege

these
things
have
i
said
well
knowing
that
they
shall
be
thee
my

grandmother
polly
what
do
you
say
to
said
nora
grandmother
i
replied
said
miss
nora
looking
at
me
with
quite
needlessly
flashing
eyes
and
i
will
set
out
on
the
search
for
this
unhappy
mummied
one
you
think
the
critics
will
call
the
rather
thin
i
demurred
to
rescue
my
ancestress
from
a
curse
said
leonora
just
one
other
thing
she
mused
we
take
a
low
comedy
character
this
time
or
not
take
ustâni
i
proposed
can
double
the
part
with
that

fares
chapter
iv
the
equipment
after
it
had
been
decided
that
we
should
start
in
search
of
who
had
been
mummified
alive
the
next
step
seemed
to
be
to
go
but
leonora
demurred
to
this
must
have
our
things
she
said
do
you
think
we
should
take
i
replied
and
i
regret
to
say
that
at
first
she
misinterpreted
the
phrase
leonora
is
a
powerful
as
well
as
a
pretty
girl
and
when
the
bear
fight
that
ensued
was
over
my
rooms
were
a
little
mixed
this
suggested
mixed
biscuits
that
invaluable
refreshment
of
the
traveller
and
from
one
thing
to
another
we
soon
made
up
a
complete
list
of
our
needs
the
scissors
and
skates
and
the
soap
we
procured
at
the
church
and
state
stores
but
not
of
course
the
revolvers
the
revolvers
we
got
of
the
genuine
government
pattern
because
both
leonora
and
i
are
dreadfully
afraid
of
and
we
knew
that
anyhow
would
not
off
the
jam
we
got
of
course
at
the
official
cartridge
emporium
same
which
we
did
shoot
the
arabs
the
gladstone
bag
and
the
bryant
may
matches
we
procured
direct
from
the
makers
resisting
the
piteous
appeals
of
itinerant
vendors
some
we
laid
in
and
as
will
presently
be
seen
we
could
have
made
no
more
judicious
purchase
wo
the
critics
say
you
are
advertising
the
stores
and
the
tradesmen
wo
like
publisher
where
would
the
of
the
story
be
see
and
the
contrast
with
the
later
goings
on
if
you
did
give
names
ed
as
from
information
received
on
a
mummy
case
we
were
travelling
in
search
of
a
mummy
of
course
we
laid
in
a
case
of
mumm
which
was
often
a
source
of
gaiety
in
our
darkest
hours
the
wine
was
procured
as
i
would
advise
every
african
traveller
to
do
from
messrs
who
printers
in
a
publisher
suppressed
the
name
gave
an
impolite
response
to
our
suggestions
as
to
mutual
ed
being
acquainted
with
the
deleterious
effects
of
a
malarious
tropical
atmosphere
we
secured
a
pair
of
overalls
advertised
as
sovran
for
the
dreaded
curse
of
an
african
climate
these
we
got
at
the
celebrated
emporium
of
messrs
name
suppressed
when
eligible
opportunity
for
advertisement
as
a
substitute
for
a
cheque
was
hinted
at
brusquely
replied
in
the
low
essex
our
preparations
being
now
exhaustively
completed
leonora
and
i
returned
to
oxford
packed
our
things
and
consulted
as
to
the
route
which
we
should
adopt

down
the
dark
river
down

so
leonora
had
decided
we
sped
ustâni
plying
the
long
pole
of
the
dhow
or

boat
while
we
took
it
in
turns
to
keep
him
up
to
his
work
by
flicking
him
with
a
the
moon
went
slowly
down
and
it
occurred
to
leonora
to
remark
that
we
were
down
too
an
unusual
thing
so
early
in
term
like
some
sweet
bride
into
her
chamber
the
moon
departed
and
the
quivering
footsteps
of
the
don
shook
the
planets
from
their
places
to
the
consternation
of
the
savilian
professor
of
astronomy
who
as
in
duty
bound
was
contemplating
these
revolutionary
performances
from
the
observatory
in
the
parks
a
number
of
moral
ideas
occurred
to
leonora
and
myself
but
out
of
regard
for
ustâni
feelings
we
denied
them
expression
i
began
indeed
to
utter
a
few
appropriate
sentiments
but
the
poor
boshman
exclaimed
floggee
floggee
missy
or
preachee
preachee
but
no
floggee
and
preachee
in
a
tone
that
would
have
disarmed

drifted
ever
downwards
obedient
to
the
inscrutable
laws
of
the
equilibrium
of
fluids
now
we
swept
past
the
white
willow
now
through
the
cruel
crawling
waters
of
the
gut
now
threaded
the
calamitous
gorge
of
iffley
and
then
shot
the
perilous
cataract
of
sandford
at
this
moment
just
when
the
dhow
was
yet
quivering
with
the
strain
i
noticed
an
expression
of
abject
fear
on
the
face
of
ustâni
his
dark
countenance
was
positively
blanched
with
horror
and
his
teeth
chattered

i
cried
querulously
perhaps
when
he
laid
down
his

and
seated
himself
in

in

exclaimed
when
the
unfortunate
ustâni
disappeared
in
a
lasher
where
we
thanks
to

gaily
enough
here
we
paused
to
catch
a

of

leonora
had
attracted
by
carefully
wearing

the

our
course
was
now
through
a
series
of
cross
streams
and
finally
we
emerged
into
a
long
perfectly
straight
and
perfectly
tranquil
expanse
of
water
bordered
by
a
path
which
had
every
appearance
of
having
been
made

night
fell
a
strange
murky
night
smelling
of
lucifer
matches
and
lit
on
the
eastern
horizon
by
a
mysterious
light
flaring
like
a
dreary
dawn
our
passage
was
obstructed
by
a
thousand
obstacles
and
at
one
point
we
plunged
into
the
very
bowels
of
the
earth
for
a
distance
of
at
least
a
quarter
of
a
mile
next
we
found
the
canal
barred
by
a
grinning
row
of
black
iron
teeth
under
which
we
dived
as
best
we
might
we
were
now
ustâni
whispered
to
us
within
the
strange
and
dreaded
region
known
to
the
superstitious
natives
as
for
the
first
time
in
our
expedition
we
heard
the
roaring
of
innumerable
wild
beasts
the
rattling
trumpet
of
the
elephant
the
drum
of
the
gorilla
the
scream
of
the
lion
the
chattering
of
countless
apes
the
yells
of
myriads
of
cockatoos
the
growls
of
bears
the
sobs
of
walri
the
whistle
of
rhinocerotes
combined
to
make
a
strange
pandemonium
strange
i
call
it
because
the
zoological
learning
i
had
picked
up
while
with
nora
at
oxford
informed
me
at
once
that
the
variety
of
roars
screams
grunts
skreeks
whirrings
which
our
footsteps
seemed
to
awake
in
every
kind
of
animal
bird
and
insect
could
be
paralleled
only
in
the
pages
of

robinson
add
to
this
that
it
was
yet
dark
as
a
day
on
the
london
flags
when
the
fog
creeps
silently
about
your
feet
and
rising
from
utter
blackness
grows
white
and
whiter
in
its
ascent
till
it
coils
round
your
neck

it
all
ed
yes
the
fog
was
playing
a
dark
game
but
nora
could
see
it
and
go
one
lighter
there
were
several
on
the
stream
we
had
quitted
she
produced
a
patent
electric
light
aided
by
this
we
looked
about
us
and
saw
the
strange
denizens
of
the
zû
patent
in
the
first
sense
of
the
word
she
has
not
yet
received
offers
advantageous
enough
to
close
with
in
the
other
sense
it
was
now
that
the
presence
of
mind
of
leonora
saved
us
foreseeing
the
probability
of
an
encounter
with
wild
beasts
she
had
filled
her
practicable
pocket
she
belonged
to
the
rational
dress

with
buns
and
nuts
the
elephant
now
walked
round
the
wolves
also
circulated
the
bear
climbed
his
pole
the
great
gorilla
beat
his
breast
and
roared
leonora
was
their
match
for
the
elephant
she
had
a
rusk
a
bun
for
the
bear
and
the
gorilla
was
pacified
by
an
offering
of
nuts
from
his
native
brazil
this
way
to
the
crocodile
house
we
now
read
on
an
inscription
in
black
letters
and
following
the
path
indicated
we
reached
the
dank
tank
where
the
monsters
dwell
we
had
arrived
at
a
place
which
i
find
it
difficult
to
describe
the
floor
was
smooth
and
hard
do
you
make
of
asked
leonora
tapping
her
dainty
foot
on
the
floor
i
replied
phlagmatically
and
she
was
silent
in
the
centre
of
the
space
was
a
dark
pool
circled
by
crystalline
palaces
inhabited
by
the
sacred
snakes
from
huge
pythons
to
the
terrapin
proud
of
his
tureen
again
there
was
a
whipsnake
and
a
toad
bloated
as
the
aristocracy
of
old
time
and
puffed
up
as
the
plutocracy
of
for
such
is
the
lot
of
toads
now
a
strange
thing
happened
said
ustâni
hark
hark
a
den
is
opening
he
was
right
it
was
the
den
of
a
catawampuss
an
animal
whose
habits
are
so
well
known
that
i
need
not
delay
to
describe
them
in
the
centre
of
the
dark
pool
in
the
middle
of
the
vague
space
lay
one
crocodile
the
rest
were
sleeping
on
the
banks
the
catawampuss
secretly
emerged
from
its
den
horror
i
am
not
ashamed
to
say
prevented
me
from
interfering
stealthily
crept
across
the
cold
floor
and
true
to
the
instincts
of
all
the
feline
tribe
made
straight
for
the
water
the
catawampuss
one
of
the
felidæ
publisher
of
course
he
is
look
at
his
name
ed
cried
ustâni
going
for
him
the
expression
was
ambiguous
but
we
understood
it
the
catawampuss
cunning
as
the
dread
jerboa
crept
to
the
edge
of
the
pool
took
a
header
into
it
and
then
still
true
to
the
feline
instincts
on
its
made
its
way
to
the
crocodile
in
this
manner
it
caught
the
crocodile
by
the
tail
and
waked
it
when
the
tail
of
a
crocodile
awakes
the
head
awakes
also
the
crocodile
head
then
waking
as
the
catawampuss
seized
its
tail
caught
the
tail
of
the
catawampuss
the
interview
was
hurried
and
tumultuous
the
crocodile
had
one
of
his
ears
chawed
off
first
blood
for
the
catawampuss
but
this
was
a
mere
temporary
advantage
when
next
we
saw
clearly
through
the
tempest
of
flying
fur
and
scales
the
head
of
the
catawampuss
entirely
and
the

this
duel
was
a
wonderful
and
shocking
sight

withdrawn

vii
among
the
how
to
escape
from
our
perilous
position
on
the
banks
of
a
pestilential
stream
haunted
by
catawampodes
and
other
fell
birds
of
prey
now
became
a
subject
for
consideration
our
object
of
course
was
to
reach
the
people
of
the
through
whose
region
according
to
the
prophecy
we
must
pass
before
finding
the
magician
that
should
guide
us
to
the
mummy
our
perplexity
was
only
increased
by
the
discovery
that
we
were
surrounded
on
every
side
by
the
walls
and
houses
of
a
gigantic
city
stealing
out
by
the
canal
as
we
had
entered
we
found
to
our
comfort
that
this
must
be
the
very
city
mentioned
by
theodolitê
as
the
seeress
had
declared
a
deep
and
noisome
night
always
prevailed
only
broken
here
and
there
as
a
wanderer
scratched
one
of
bryant
matches
and
painfully
endeavoured
to
decipher
the
number
on
the
door
of
his
house
the
streets
moreover
were
strewn
and
interwoven
with
long
strings
of
iron
fallen
from
the
sky
people
who
wire
themselves
with
whispered
leonora
do
you
think
of
my
interpretation
shall
inquire
i
answered
and
i
inquire
for
the
land
of
the
but
in
vain
happily
we
chanced
to
meet
an
old
man
clothed
in
a
whitish
robe
of
some
unknown
substance
not
unlike
paper
this
fluttering
vesture
was
marked
with
strange
characters
in
black
and
red
which
leonora
was
able
to
interpret
she
read
them
thus
they
were

on

apparently

be
deciphered
he
had
a
large
and
ragged
staff
on
his
back
he
carried
a
vast
budget
and
he
was
always
asking
everybody
you
put
something
in
the
budget
said
leonora
in
a
respectful
tone
thou
tell
us
the
way
to
the
land
of
the
people
called
and
the
place
of
the
rolling
of
logs
he
stroked
his
beautiful
white
beard
and
smiled
faintly
child
we
not
only
know
it
but
ourselves
discovered
it
and
wrote
it
up
we
mean
sent
our
representative
he
answered
it
was
a
peculiarity
of
this
man
that
he
always
spoke
like
royalty
in
the
first
person
plural
if
a
daughter
may
ask
said
leonora
is
the
name
of
my
father
stedfastly
regarding
her
he
answered
name
is
pellmelli
whither
go
we
my
father
you
shall
see
as
soon
that
is
as
the
fog
lifts
or
as
our
representative
has
made
interest
with
a
gas
company
with
these
words
he
furnished
an
unequalled
supply
of
litter
which
came
he
said
the
office
where
there
was
plenty
and
we
were
borne
rapidly
in
a
westward
direction
as
we
journeyed
old
pellmelli
gave
us
a
good
deal
of
information
about
the
whom
he
did
not
seem
to
like
they
were
he
said
a
savage
and
treacherous
tribe
inhabiting
for
the
most
part
the
ruined
abodes
of
some
kingly
race
of
old
the
names
of
their
chief
dwellings
he
told
us
were
still
called
in
some
ancient
and
speech
academy
and
athenæum
leonora
whose
knowledge
of
languages
was
extensive
and
peculiar
told
pellmelli
that
these
names
were
derived
from
the
old
greek
said
he
have
clearly
drunk
of
the
wisdom
of
the
past
and
thy
hands
have
held
the
water
of
the
world
knowledge
know
you
latin
also
o
pellmelli
replied
leonora
and
pellmelli
said
he
preferred
modern
tongues
though
it
would
often
be
useful
to
him
if
he
did
in
his
dealings
with
the
if
our
greek
is
a
little
to
seek
our
russian
is
he
said
proudly
he
was
very
bitter
against
the
the
favourite
weapon
he
told
us
was
the
club
and
he
even
proposed
to
show
us
this
instrument
our
litter
presently
stopped
outside
a
stately
palace
the
street
was
dark
as
always
in
this
strange
city
but
old
pellmelli
paused
sniffed
and
bending
his
ear
to
the
ground
listened
intently
smell
the
incense
he
said
hear
the
melodious
rolling
of
the
logs
but
they
shall
know
their
master
thus
speaking
he
led
us
into
a
vast
hall
where
the
were
sitting
or
standing
each
other
incense
as
pellmelli
remarked
from
thin
tubes
of
paper
which
smoked
at
one
end
listen
said
pellmelli
and
he
cried
aloud
the
name
of
a
poet
known
to
the
instantly
we
heard
from
i
know
not
what
recess
a
rolling
fire
of
applause
and
admiration
which
swept
past
us
with
stately
and
solemn
music
like
a
hymn
of
praise
said
pellmelli
told
you
so
this
is
the
place
of
the
rolling
of
logs
and
yourselves
have
heard
it
leonora
said
she
did
not
mind
how
often
she
heard
it
as
she
quite
agreed
with
the
sentiments
so
said
pellmelli
and
he
cried
aloud
another
name
the
name
of
a
poetaster
which
was
almost
strange
to
us
then
followed
through
that
vasty
hall
a
sharp
and
rattling
crash
as
of
the
descent
of
innumerable
slates
heavens
whispered
leonora
the
writing
place
where
they
slate
as
were
strangers
and
wholly
unknown
to
the
we
thought
they
might
slate
and
beating
a
hasty
retreat
soon
found
ourselves
with
pellmelli
in
the
dark
outer
air
are
a
desperate
lot
said
he
wo
ever
put
anything
in
the
budget
he
was
quivering
with
indignation
and
leonora
to
soothe
him
told
him
the
story
of
our
quest
for
the
mummy
and
asked
him
if
he
could
help
us
are
your
man
said
he
propose
to
send
our
representative
to
interview
a
magician
who
has
just
arrived
in
this
country
he
is
a
mysterious
character
his
name
is
asher
and
it
is
said
that
he
is
the
wandering
jew
or
at
all
events
has
lived
for
many
centuries
he
if
any
one
can
direct
you
in
your
search
pronounced
ed
he
then
appointed
a
place
where
his
representative
should
meet
us
next
day
and
we
separated
pellmelli
taking
his
staff
and
going
off
to
lead
an
excursion
against
the
a
brutal
and
licentious
tribe
chapter
viii
he
next
day
leonora
was
suffering
from
a
slight
feverish
cold
and
i
wonder
at
it
considering
what
we
suffered
in
the
zû
i
therefore
went
alone
to
the
rendezvous
where
i
was
to
meet
representative
to
my
surprise
nobody
was
there
but
old
pellmelli
himself
you
said
you
would
send
your
representative
i
exclaimed
are
our
usual
representative
he
answered
rather
sulkily
on
for
we
have
to
call
on
apples
the
famous
advertisers
said
i
you
ask
he
replied
aught
be
more
interesting
than
an
advertiser
call
it
log
rolling
i
answered
but
he
was
silent
he
went
at
a
great
pace
and
presently
in
a
somewhat
sordid
street
pointed
his
finger
silently
to
an
object
over
a
door
was
the
carven
head
of
an
ethiopian
this
new
confirmation
of
the
prophecy
gave
me
quite
a
turn
especially
when
i
read
the
characters
inscribed
beneath
try
our
fine
negro
head
dwells
the
sorcerer
even
asher
said
pellmelli
and
began
to
crawl
upstairs
on
his
hands
and
knees
do
you
do
that
i
asked
determined
if
i
must
follow
pellmelli
at
all
events
not
to
follow
his
example
is
the
manner
of
the
tribe
of
interviewers
my
daughter
ours
is
a
blessed
task
yet
must
we
feign
humility
or
the
savage
people
kick
us
and
drive
us
forth
with
our
garments
rent
he
now
humbly
tapped
at
a
door
and
a
strange
voice
cried
pellmelli
whose
russian
is
his
strong
point
paused
in
doubt
but
i
explained
that
the
word
was
french
for
in
he
crawled
in
on
his
stomach
while
i
followed
him
erect
and
we
found
ourselves
before
a
strange
kind
of
tent
it
had
four
posts
and
a
broidered
veil
was
drawn
all
round
it
within
the
veil
the
sorcerer
was
concealed
and
he
asked
in
a
gruff
tone
pellmelli
explained
that
he
had
come
to
receive
a
brief
personal
statement
for
the
budget
the
voice
replied
without
hesitation
centuries
and
the
æons
pass
and
i
too
make
the
pass
saute
la
he
added
in
a
foreign
tongue
thy
race
wore
naught
but
a
little
blue
paint
i
dwelt
among
the
forgotten
peoples
the
red
sea
knows
me
and
the
nile
has
turned
scarlet
at
my
words
i
am
khoot
hoomi
i
am
also
the
chela
of
the
mountain
it
is
my
turn
to
ask
a
few
easy
questions
sitteth
on
the
throne
of
hokey
pokey
winky
wum
the
monarch
of
the
anthropophagi
the
jews
yet
come
to
their
land
or
have
the
owners
of
the
land
gone
to
the
jews
darius
the
mede
yet
rule
or
hath
his
kingdom
passed
to
the
bassarids
as
pellmelli
was
utterly
floored
by
these
inquiries
which
indicated
that
the
sorcerer
had
been
for
a
considerable
time
out
of
the
range
of
the
daily
papers
i
answered
them
as
well
as
i
could
when
his
very
natural
curiosity
had
been
satisfied
by
a
course
of
mangnall
questions
i
ventured
to
broach
my
own
business
he
said
he
did
not
deal
in
mummies
himself
though
he
had
a
stuffed
crocodile
very
much
at
my
service
but
would
i
call
and
bring
leonora
he
added
that
he
had
known
of
our
coming
by
virtue
of
his
secret
art
of
divination
thyself
he
added
gaze
without
extra
charge
in
the
fountain
of
knowledge
thrusting
a
withered
yellow
hand
out
of
the
mystic
tent
he
pointed
to
a
table
where
stood
a
small
circular
dish
or
cup
of
white
earthenware
containing
some
brown
milky
liquid
therein
said
the
sorcerer
i
gazed
was
a
stranger
in
the
tea
deeply
impressed
with
the
belief
laugh
at
it
if
you
will
that
i
was
in
the
presence
of
a
being
of
more
than
mortal
endowments
i
was
withdrawing
when
my
glance
fell
on
his
weird
familiars
two
tailless
cats
this
prodigy
made
me
shudder
and
i
said
in
tones
of
the
deepest
awe
and
sympathy
puss
came
the
strange
voice
from
within
the
tent
are
without
tails
i
bred
them
so
it
hath
taken
many
centuries
and
much
trouble
but
at
last
i
have
triumphed
once
too
i
reared
a
breed
of
dogs
with
two
tails
but
after
a
while
they
became
a
proverb
for
pride
nature
loathed
them
and
they
perished
greek
chaire
i
have
consulted
the
authorities
at
the
british
museum
who
tell
me
these
are
the
greek
and
the
latin
words
for
you
think
you
had
better
go
get
out
ed
this
though
not
understood
of
course
by
pellmelli
was
as
good
as
an
invitation
to
withdraw
so
i
induced
the
old
man
to
come
away
promising
the
magician
i
would
return
on
the
morrow
who
was
this
awful
man
to
whom
centuries
were
as
moments
whose
very
correspondence
as
i
had
noticed
came
through
the
dead
letter
office
and
who
spoke
in
the
tongues
of
the
dead
past
chapter
ix
the
power
of
he
next
day
leonora
the
boshman
and
i
returned
to
the
home
of
the
mage
he
stood
before
us
a
tall
thin
figure
enwrapped
in
yellowish
strange
garments
of
a
singular
and
perfumed
character
spicy
in
fact
which
produced
upon
me
a
feeling
which
i
can
not
attempt
to
describe
and
which
i
can
only
vaguely
hint
at
by
saying
that
the
whole
form
conveyed
to
me
the
notion
of
wrapped
the
public
will
say
so
is
your
publisher
do
give
it
away
but
that
what
i
ed
with
a
curious
swaying
motion
which
i
have
never
seen
anything
like
for
he
seemed
less
to
be
walking
than
to
be
impelled
from
behind
like
a
perambulator
or
dragged
from
in
front
like
a
he
advanced
to
the
table
where
lay
some
pieces
of
a
white
substance
like
papyrus
all
of
the
same
size
and
oblong
shape
which
showed
on
their
surfaces
some
of
them
figures
and
faces
curiously
stained
and
others
red
and
black
dots
arranged
as
it
seemed
to
me
in
some
sort
of
design
although
at
first
sight
they
looked
jumbled
enough
near
to
these
lay
a
book
bound
in
brown
but
with
heavy
black
and
gold
lettering
amid
which
i
thought
i
could
make
out
the
words
and
the
name
the
swathed
figure
poised
itself
a
moment
resting
one
thin
hand
on
the
table
and
then
spoke
is
naught
that
is
wonderful
about
this
matter
it
said
you
but
understand
it
prestigiation
itself
is
wonderful
but
that
its
phases
and
phrases
should
be
changed
is
not
wonderful
not
now
i
ween
is
the
of
the
ancient
wizard
seen
not
now
the
presto
pass
of
the
less
ancient
conjurer
heard
nay
all
things
change
yet
i
change
not
that
which
is
not
yet
can
not
yet
have
taken
place
at
least
not
its
proper
place
that
which
shall
not
be
may
yet
come
to
a
bad
pass
and
the
blind
race
of
man
watches
helpless
the
trammels
it
could
shake
off
did
it
but
greatly
dare
my
business
ladies
and
gentlemen
now
is
as
i
have
just
explained
to
you
to
attempt
to
puzzle
your
eyes
by
the
quickness
of
my
fingers
yours
on
the
other
hand
will
be
to
detect
the
way
or
as
old
simon
magus
used
to
say
in
which
i
perform
my
little
wonders
if
you
can
will
any
gentleman
lend
me
a
helmet
i
mean
a
hat
as
the
only
male
person
present
was
the
boshman
this
appeared
to
me
a
futile
question
and
even
the
stately
magician
seemed
to
be
struck
by
some
dim
idea
of
the
kind
for
i
could
discern
a
pair
of
mysterious
eyes
peering
anxiously
through
his
swathings
and
i
heard
him
mutter
to
himself
in
several
languages
to
have
thought
of
that
no
hat
present
do
know
any
trick
to
produce
one
nothing
about
it
in
the
book
but
he
recovered
himself
quickly
and
went
on
in
clear
cheerful
tones
and
gentlemen
as
no
person
present
has
a
hat
i
will
proceed
to
another
of
the
tricks
on
my
little
programme
will
any
lady
oblige
me
by
drawing
a
card
will
you
madam
he
said
bowing
with
infinite
grace
to
leonora
her
hand
touched
asher
as
she
drew
a
card
and
i
saw
a
shiver
pass
over
the
veiled
figure
the
lady
on
your
left
now
oblige
me
he
continued
turning
to
me
who
was
indeed
standing
on
leonora
left
hand
though
how
he
knew
it
is
a
thing
i
have
never
been
able
fully
to
understand
please
he
continued
well
at
your
cards
but
do
not
show
them
to
me
or
to
each
other
greek
konx
ompax
now
please
still
hiding
the
cards
from
me
and
from
each
other
exchange
them
now
he
continued
his
form
dilating
with
conscious
power
how
true
is
it
that
change
is
perennial
even
so
far
as
magic
and
nature
herself
can
be
perennial
for
she
who
held
the
king
of
hearts
now
holds
the
queen
of
spades
and
she
who
held
the
queen
of
spades
now
holds
the
king
of
hearts
thus
much
among
the
shifting
shadows
of
life
can
i
the
wizard
see
as
a
sure
and
accomplished
fact
is
it
not
so
my
children
we
bowed
in
silence
overawed
by
the
wonder
of
his
presence
although
leonora
whispered
to
me
has
got
the
cards
wrong
but
we
had
better
say
nothing
about
it
now
he
continued
upon
this
glass
it
was
an
ordinary
wineglass
and
on
this
silver
coin
producing
a
of
the
eretrian
republic
i
place
the
coin
in
the
glass
and
now
can
i
tell
you
by
its
means
what
you
will
of
the
future
there
is
no
magic
in
it
only
a
little
knowledge
of
the
secrets
mutable
yet
immutable
of
nature
and
this
is
an
old
secret
i
did
not
find
it
it
was
known
of
yore
in
atlantis
and
in
chichimec
in
ur
and
in
lycosura
even
now

any

the

he
continued
in
a
hoarse
semitic
whisper
for
all
currencies
and
all
languages
were
alike
to
him
it

said
leonora
in

accents
demand
to
know
if
i
shall
find
that
which
i
seek
the
figure
drawing
itself
up
to
its
full
height
passed
its
hand
with
a
proud
impatient
and
mystic
gesture
across
the
glass
and
then
stood
in
the
attitude
of
one
who
awaited
a
response
the
coin
my
daughter
jump
three
times
he
said
answer
is
yea
should
it
jump
but
once
nay
we
waited
anxiously
the
coin
did
not
jump
at
all
the
wizard
took
up
the
glass
shook
it
impatiently
and
put
it
down
again
still
the
coin
showed
no
sign
of
animation
then
the
wizard
uttered
some
private
ejaculations
in
hittite
but
still
the
coin
did
not
move
then
he
affected
an
air
of
jauntiness
and
said
remember
a
circumstance
of
a
similar
kind
when
i
was
playing
odd
man
out
greek
tritos
anthrôpos
dear
old
sokrates
used
to
call
it
with
darius
the
night
before
marathon
darius
was
the
mede
was
the
medium
then
he
seemed
about
to
work
another
wonder
when
he
was
interrupted
by
the
harsh
cackling
laughter
of
the
boshman
who
advanced
with
careless
defiance
and
observed
in
his
own
tongue
which
we
all
knew
perfectly
that
he
see
all
the
tricks
the
wizard
could
do
and
go
several
better
i
waited
to
see
what
would
follow
this
insolence
asher
made
a
movement
so
swift
that
i
could
scarcely
follow
it
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
lightly
laid
his
hand
upon
the
poor
head
i
looked
at
ustâni
and
then
staggered
back
in
wonder
for
there
upon
his
snowy
hair
right
across
the
tresses
were
five
as
go
and
stand
in
the
corner
said
the
magician
in
a
cold
inhuman
voice
the
unhappy
boshman
tremblingly
did
his
bidding
putting
his
hands
to
his
head
in
a
dazed
way
as
he
went
and
incredible
as
it
may
seem
thus
transferring
as
if
the
curse
carried
double
force
some
of
the
black
mark
to
his
own
fingers
will
now
continued
the
wizard
who
had
regained
his
ordinary
polished
if
somewhat
swaying
and
overbalanced
manner
will
now
with
your
kind
permission
show
you
a
little
trick
which
was
a
great
favourite
with
the
late
tubal
cain
when
we
were
boys
together
observe
i
take
this
it
is
an
ordinary
look
at
it
for
yourselves
i
will
place
it
on
my
hand
it
is
an
ordinary
hand
look
at
it
for
yourselves
but
do
touch
it
the
consequences
might
be
disastrous
i
for
my
part
having
seen
the
consequences
in
the
case
of
hair
had
no
desire
to
do
so
see
continued
the
sorcerer
place
the
it
falls
why
because
of
gravity
what
is
gravity
newton
as
you
know
well
invented
the
art
but
what
of
that
did
he
find
that
which
did
not
exist
no
for
the
is
as
though
it
had
never
been
but
now
availing
myself
of
the
resources
of
science
which
is
ever
old
and
ever
young
i
clasp
my
wrist
the
wrist
of
the
hand
on
which
the
rests
with
the
other
hand
and
you
see
as
the
sorcerer
spoke
he
deftly
turned
his
hand
palm
downwards
and
the
fell
with
a
crash
and
a
clatter
on
the
floor
it
was
terrible
to
see
the
dumb
wrath
of
the
swathed
figure
at
this
new
defeat
even
in
this
moment
the
boshman
glided
like
a
serpent
among
us
picked
up
the
and
triumphantly
performed
the
very
miracle
in
which
the
wizard
had
failed
a
harsh
cackle
of
laughter
announced
his
success
but
the
mage
was
even
with
him
or
rather
he
was
and
evens
rapidly
he
drew
his
forefinger
across
the
boshman
face
perpendicularly
and
horizontally
illustration
on
the
skin
of
ustâni
azure
with
terror
appeared
the
above
diagram
in
lines
of
white
the
mage
then
made
the
sign
of
a
thus
illustration
and
challenged
leonora
to
a
contest
of
skill
in
and
crosses
but
the
boshman
catching
a
view
of
his
own
altered
aspect
in
a
mirror
exclaimed
ustâni
him
no
standy
he
him
show
hisself
for
tin

one
shilling
kids
tizzy
umslopoguey
and
he
sloped
nor
did
we
ever
again
see
this
victim
of
an
overwhelming
power
limited
we
presently
took
our
leave
of
the
mage
promising
to
call
next
day
and
bring
a
policeman

though
leonora
faith
in
the
magician
had
been
a
good
deal
shaken
by
his
failures
in
his
black
art
she
admitted
that
as
a
clairvoyant
he
might
be
more
inspired
we
therefore
went
as
he
had
directed
us
to
the
neighbourhood
of
clare
market
where
he
had
prophesied
that
we
should
find
a
temple
adorned
with
the
three
balls
of
gold
which
the
lombards
bore
with
them
from
their
far
aryan
home
in
frangipani
nor
did
this
part
of
the
prophecy
fail
to
coincide
with
the
document
on
the
mummy
case
through
the
thick
and
choking
darkness
which
has
made
lights

a
proverb
we
beheld
the
glittering
of
three
aureate
orbs
and
now
how
to
win
our
way
without
or
indeed
into
this
home
of
mystery
here
in
these
immemorial
recesses
the
natives
had
long
been
wont
to
bury
as
we
learned
their
oldest
objects
of
interest
and
value
there
when
we
pushed
our
way
within
the
swinging
portal
lay
around
us
in
vast
and
solemn
pyramids
of
portable
property
the
silent
and
touching
monuments
of
human
existence
the
busy
life
of
a
nation
lay
sleeping
here
here
for
example
stood
that
ancestral
instrument
for
the
reckoning
of
winged
time
which
in
the
native
language
is
styled
a
clock
hard
by
lay
the
pipe
fashioned
of
the
of
perilous
seas
in
fairy
lands
forlorn
the
pipe
on
which
perchance
some
swain
had
discoursed
sweet
music
near
the
shady
heights
of
high
holborn
the
cradle
of
infancy
the
gamp
of
decrepitude
the
tricycle
of
fleeting
youth
the
paraffin
lamp
which
had
lighted
bridal
gaiety
the
flask
which
had
held
the
foaming
malt
all
were
gathered
here
and
the
dust
lay
deep
on
all
of
them
i
was
about
to
make
some
appropriate
moral
remarks
when
i
heard
leonora
whose
command
of
tongues
is
simply
address
an
attendant
priestess
in
the
local
dialect
miss
said
she
much
can
yer
let
us
on
this
ticker
producing
her
watch
the
priestess
whose
features
and
two
lovely
black
eyes
betrayed
a
mixture
of
semitic
blood
was
examining
the
as
she
called
the
watch
when
leonora
saying
the
word
rather
violently
called
my
attention
with
her
elbow
to
a
strange
parcel
lying
apart
from
the
rest
it
was
a
long
bundle
as
long
as
a
man
and
was
swathed
in
cerements
of
white
egyptian
tissue
you
is
you
i
sneezed
rapturously
recognising
the
object
of
our
search
the
very
mummy
which
two
thousand
years
ago
theodolitê
had
prepared
with
her
own
fair
but
cruel
hands
there
beyond
the
shadow
of
doubt
lay
all
that
was
mortal
of
the
unlucky
jambres
on
the
tissue
which
wrapped
the
bundle
i
distinctly
recognised
stencilled
mark
corresponding
to
leonora

duck

egg
of
a
duck
and
an
umbrella

most
important
to
have
this
cover
bound

much
said
i
to
the
priestess
of
the
temple
you
afford
to
let
me
have
that
old
bundle
of
rags
for
old
bundle
of
rags
said
the
woman
it
dear
lady
take
it
and
keep
it
if
you
can
and
the
blessing
of
abraham
be
on
your
head
so
anxious
was
she
to
part
with
the
mummy
that
we
could
hardly
get
her
to
accept
a
merely
nominal
price
to
give
plausibility
to
the
purchase
we
said
we
wanted
the
rags
for
a
joyously
did
leonora
and
i
call
a
passing
chariot
and
with
the
mummy
between
us
we
drove
to
our
abode
i
was
surprised
on
the
way
by
receiving
a
pettish
push
from
leonora
foot
tread
on
my
toes
she
said
though
i
had
not
even
stirred
i
told
her
as
much
and
we
were
getting
a
little
animated
when
my
bonnet
was
twitched
off
and
thrown
out
into
the
darkness
i
said
severely
manners
are
unworthy
of
a
lady
declare
my
dear
polly
she
replied
i
never
even
moved
and
as
she
was
obviously
in
earnest
i
had
to
accept
her
word
when
we
reached
home
after
a
series
of
petty
but
provoking
accidents
we
first
locked
up
the
mummy
very
carefully
in
the
spare
bedroom
would
be
time
enough
we
said
to
consult
the
wizard
as
to
our
next
movement
we
ordered
a
repast
of
the
native
viands
which
included
i
remember
a
small
but
savoury
fish
the
and
sought
our
couches
in
better
spirits
than
usual
i
say
are
you
not
gliding
insensibly
into
fallen
publisher
not
a
bit
you
wait
and
you
ed
next
morning
long
before
leonora
was
awake
the
young
but
intelligent
slavî
so
the
common
people

crept
into
my
chamber
with
a
face
she
said
it
is
a
term
of
courtesy
a
night

having
what

and
crying

for

i
asked
though
every
hair
upon
my
head
stood
erect
with
horror
adding
greatly
to
the
peculiarity
of
my
appearance
did
you
take
it
what
it
asked
for
mum
for
very
fear
i
dared
not
refuse
and
when
i
had
handed
it
in
by
a
chink
in
the
open
door
first
there
was
a
sound
like
drinking
then
an
awful
cry
potash
again
and
then
a
heavy
soft
thud
as
if
you
had
knocked
over
a
bolster
stuffed
with
lead
mum
through
the
brown
glimmer
of
dawn
it
was
about
ten
i
hurried
to
leonora
chamber
she
was
dressed
and
came
out
do
you
advise
i
asked
for
urmson
the
eminent
lawyer
at
once
said
she
is
used
to
this
kind
of
thing
nothing
like
taking
counsel
opinion
but
first
let
me
knock
the
door
open
she
applied
her
magnificent
white
shoulder
to
the
door
which
flew
into
splinters
there
was
not
a
trace
of
the
mummy
but
there
in
a
deprecatory
attitude
stood
the
philosopher

that

never

the
proud
girl
indignantly
as
if

answer
me
a
man

seen
as
much
of
life
as
i
have
answered
the
magician
the
æons
are
to
him
merely
as
drops
in
a
bucket
which
he
will
never
kick
and
when
he
suffers
he
added
mournfully
attacks
of
multiplex
personality
he
recognises
the
futility
of
personal
explanations
least
i
can
compel
you
to
tell
us
is
the
mummy
said
leonora
am
or
lately
was
that
mummy
said
the
wizard
haughtily
then
drawing
himself
up
to
his
full
height
he
added
am

real
jambres

he
added
solemnly

replied
the

outside
of

he
said
tenderly
the
haste
of
youth
and
inexperience
when
you
have
lived
as
long
as
i
have
you
will
know
better
hearken
to
my
story
or
four
thousand
years
ago
for
what
is
time
i
was
the
authorised
magician
at
the
court
of
ptolemy
patriarchus
i
had
a
rival
the
noted
witch
theodolitê
in
an
evil
hour
she
won
me
by
a
show
of
false
affection
and
taking
advantage
of
my
passion
mummified
me
alive
to
this
i
owe
my
remarkable
state
of
preservation
at
an
advanced
age
bien
he
added
fatuously
she
only
half
accomplished
her
purpose
by
some
accident
which
has
never
been
explained
and
in
spite
of
the
stress
of
competition
she
had
purchased
salts
of
potash
for
the
execution
of
her
fell
purpose
in
place
of
salts
of
soda
this
i
owe
it
that
i
am
now
a
living
man
and
in
a
moment
a
certain
stiffness
of
demeanour
which
we
had
noticed
but
ascribed
to
pride
worked
an
unspeakable
change
in
the
mage
as
we
looked
at
him
hardened
into
our
cheap
a
jolly
go
said
leonora
her
mind
submerged
in
terror
i
sprang
to
the
bell
water
at
once
i
cried
and
the
appeared
with
the
fluid
we
applied
it
to
the
parched
lips
of
the
mummy
and
jambres
was
himself
again
will
you
tell
me
i
asked
when
he
had
been
given
a
cigarette
and
made
comfortable
we
found
you
i
mean
the
mummy
under
the
three
balls
a
pledge
he
replied
my
resources
ran
low
and
my
rent
was
unpaid
the
landlady
used
to
take
advantage
of
my
condition
and
raise
a
small
sum
on
me
all
seemed
now
explained
but
leonora
was
not
yet
satisfied
have
she
began
a
strawberry
mark
he
replied
wearily
the
usual
place
quest
is
accomplished
i
said
replied
jambres
to
give
him
his
real
name
is
still

adventure
of

the

scheme
must
as
you
are
aware
visit
the
siege
perilous
in
the
hall
of
egypt
and
risk
ourselves
in
the
chair
of
the
viewless
maiden
of
her
that
is
not
to
be
seen
of
man
know
it
said
leonora
is
continued
the
mage
wish
to
accomplish
the
end
for
which
you
set
forth
this
seems
to
you
an
easy
matter
enough
young
hearts
are
full
of
such
illusions
and
believe
me
i
would
willingly
change
my
years
which
are
lost
in
geological
time
for
one
hand
breadth
of
your
daring
know
then
continued
this
strange
creature
the
time
has
now
come
when
matters
must
be
brought
to
an
end
between
us
it
will
be
my
business
and
i
will
add
my
pleasure
he
continued
with
a
lofty
air
which
sat
drolly
enough
upon
him
in
his
yellow
duds
conduct
you
to
the
siege
perilous
from
you
in
return
i
must
exact
an
unquestioning
obedience
and
i
will
add
a
measureless
i
beg
you
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
slightest
resistance
to
my
will
must
be
followed
by
consequences
of
which
you
can
not
estimate
either
the
reach
or
the
extension
there
was
such
a
pomp
about
the
creature
tautology
and
such
an
affectation
of
fine
manners
his
constant
obeisances
that
i
could
hold
it
no
longer
but
fairly
laughed
out
in
his
face
i
dreaded
it
is
true
lest
some
such
fate
as
ustâni
might
punish
me
for
my
temerity
but
for
reasons
which
doubtless
seemed
sufficient
to
himself
the
wizard
merely
looked
at
me
through
his
veil
shook
himself
a
little
in
his
swathings
and
said
in

there
ye

first
it

have
declared
that
ye
shall
show
your

i
value
not
wealth
gold

mere
dross
nay
i
have
the
mines
of
king
solomon
at
my
disposal
but
when
the
weary
king
ecclesiast
confided
to
me
in
his
palace
of
ivory
and
cedar
in
jerusalem
long
ago
the
secret
of
these
diamond
treasures
he
bade
me
reveal
it

said

me
then
merely

chapter
xiii
the
perilous
path
forth
we
rushed
into
the
darkness
through
the
streaming
deluge
of
that
tropic
clime
for
the
seraphic
frenzy
had
now
come
upon
the
mage
in
good
earnest
and
all
the
burned
in
his
dusky
eyes
we
presented
indeed
a
strange
spectacle
for
the
mage
in
his
silvery
swathings
held
leonora
by
the
hands
and
leonora
held
me
as
we
raced
through
the
gloom
in
any
other
city
our
aspect
and
demeanour
had
excited
attention
and
claimed
the
interference
of
the
authorities
in
berlin
uhlans
would
have
charged
us
in
paris
would
have
ploughed
through
our
ranks
they
deemed
we
were
but
of
the
sacred
race
of
who
by
a
custom
of
the
strange
people
are
permitted
to
run
at
random
through
the
streets
and
even
to
enter
private
houses
we
were
not
even
followed
in
our
headlong
career
by
a
crowd
for
the
public
had
ceased
to
interest
itself
in
frenzied
research
for
hidden
pins
or
concealed
cigarettes
after
a
frantic
chase
jambres
late
mage
paused
breathless
in
front
of
a
building
of
portentous
proportions
how
it
chanced
i
have
never
been
able
to
understand
but
as
i
am
a
living
and
honourable
woman
this
hall
had
the
characteristics
of
ancient
egyptian
architecture
and
that
miraculous
as
it
may
appear
in
perfect
preservation
there
are
the
hypostyle
halls
the
two
osirid
pillars
colossal
figures
of
strange
gods
in
coloured
relief
there
is
the
great
blue
scarab
the
cartouche
the
the
and
all
that
we
admire
in
the
rameseum
of
the
ancient
empire
but
all
was
silent
all
was
deserted
the
vast
adamantine
portals
were
closed
jambres
paused
in
dismay
i
last
gave
an
exhibition
of
mine
art
in
those
halls
said
he
was
in
old
forgotten
days
in
bosco
palmy
time
much
is
altered
open
sesame
he
cried
but
curious
to
say
at
that
moment
a
dark
figure
crawled
submissively
to
our
feet
it
was
old
pellmelli
his
instinct
for
had
brought
him
on
our
track
and
he
began
our
representative
i
am
commissioned
jambres
late
turned
from
him
and
he
fell
still
making
notes
prone
on
his
face
where
we
left
him
as
the
pace
was
too
good
to
inquire
the
mage
now
reconnoitred
carefully
the
vast
façade
of
the
hall
of
egypt
and
finally
fixed
his
gaze
on
a
perpendicular
leaden
column
adorned
with
strange
symbols
through
which
for
it
was
a
rainy
night
raging
torrents
of
water
were
distinctly
heard
flowing
downwards
to
who
knows
what
abysmal
and
unfathomable
depths
in
this
weird
climate
it
was
the
familiar
yet
dreaded
jambres
with
the
feline
agility
of
a
catapult
of
the
mountain
began
to
climb
the
perpendicular
leaden
channel
to
which
he
had
called
our
attention
and
of
course
we
had
to
follow
him
it
was
perfectly
marvellous
to
see
the
ease
and
grace
with
which
he
skipped
and
hopped
up
the
seemingly
naked
face
of
the
wall
there
were
places
indeed
where
our
position
was
perilous
enough
and
it
did
not
add
to
our
cheerfulness
to
hear
the
horrid
roaring
and
gurgling
of
the
unseen
and
imprisoned
waters
that
poured
down
the
channel
with
a
violence
which
seemed
as
if
they
might
at
any
moment
burst
their
bonds
helped
however
by
certain
ledges
which
projected
from
the
wall
beneath
square
openings
filled
with
some
transparent
substance
on
which
ledges
from
time
to
time
we
rested
we
arrived
at
the
steep
crest
and
paused
for
repose
beneath
the
leafy
shade
of
the
jambres
lightly
leading
the
way
said
jambres
the
most
delicate
part
of
our
journey
so
indeed
it
proved
for
the
mage
began
rapidly
to
divest
himself
of
his
mysterious
swathings
wrapper
by
wrapper
he
undid
cerement
on
cerement
till
both
leonora
and
i
wondered
when
he
would
stop
stop
he
did
however
and
with
a
practised
hand
shot
his
linen
into
one
long
rope
which
he
carefully
attached
to
an
erect
and
smoking
pillar
perhaps
of
basaltic
formation
perhaps
an
ancient
altar
of
simeon
skylitês
when
all
was
taut
jambres
approached
a
slanting
slope
smooth
and
transparent
perhaps
of
glacial
origin
on
this
he
stamped
and
the
fragments
tinkled
as
they
fell
into
unknown
deeps
then
he
seized
the
rope
let
himself
down
and
from
far
below
we
heard
his
voice
calling
to
us
to
follow
him
leonora
and
i
descended
with
agility
to
some
monstrous
basin
in
the
abyss
the
pit
jambres
called
it
here
jambres
met
us
and
bade
us
light
the
railway
which
as
i
forgot
to
mention
we
had
brought
with
us
then
jumping
off
with
the
lead
he
advanced
along
the
floor
picking
his
way
with
great
care
as
indeed
it
was
most
necessary
to
do
for
the
floor
was
strewn
with
strange
forms
stumbling
over
the
legs
and
backs
of
which
it
would
have
been
easy
to
break
one
own
when
we
halted
brought
up
by
a
barrier
of
which
i
did
not
at
first
discern
the
nature
our
lamps
as
is
sometimes
the
way
of
some
such
patent
lamps
suddenly
went
out
jambres
whispered
hoarsely
are

waitin
for
come
on
greek
all
age
est
we
saw
before
us
a
vast
expanse
of
which
it
was
impossible
to
gauge
the
extent
so
impenetrable
so
overpowering
was
the
gloom
of
its
blackness

the
abode
said
jambres
mysteriously
my
rival

himself
owing
to
his
use
of
his
swathings
was
sufficiently
i

i
managed

on
the
hither
side
was
a
row
of
à
which
seemed
on
the
darkness
and
in
their
centre
a
sudden
chasm
which
looked
as
if
it
had
been
made
by
human
agency
the
fitful
moonbeams
showed
us
a
most
curious
and
accurately
shaped
spur
or
as
it
is
called
in
the
native
dialect
which
connected
the
floor
on
which
we
stood
with
the
darkness
beyond

that
why
i
do
ed
what
mortal
however
hardy
dared
cross
this
quivering
wavering
bridge
in
the
total
darkness
beneath
our
feet
it
swayed
and
leaped
like
rotten
ice
on
the
magic
serpentine
cried
jambres
comes
it
comes
be
still
even
as
he
spoke
we
saw
a
shaft
of
yellow
streaming
from
an
unknown
centre
and
searching
out
the
recesses
of
the
cavern
still
as
you
value
your
liberty
whispered
jambres
bobî

on

beat
then
as
the
long
shaft
smote
the
swaying
bridge
he
lightly
crossed
it
and
beckoned
us
to
follow
we
obeyed
and
in
another
instant
all
was
again
darkness
has
gone

round

be
back
for
hours
chapter

the
magic
chair
there
on
the
plateau
or
platform
we
had
seen
stood
in
naked
mystery
the
enchanted
chair
the
weird
chair
of
the
viewless
maiden

place
of
her
who
is
no

i

so
maiden
murmured
jambres
it
not
till
i
have
made
experience
thereof
me
it
can
not
harm
in
me
you
see
the
original
inventor
beware
of
spurious
imitations
but
it
is
a
dread
experience
let
me
work
it
first
leonora
could
not
resist
his
winning
manner
and
concern
for
her
safety
move
she
said
jambres
do
take
the
chair
at
this
meeting
second
that
proposal
said
i
and
there
was
not
a
dissentient
voice
jambres
will
now
take
the
chair
said
leonora
and
the
wizard
his
swathing
robes
bulging
with
leonora
securities
glided
forward
then
an
awful
thing
occurred
no
sooner
had
jambres
sat
down
than
leonora
and
i
found
ourselves
how
can
we
expect
it
to
be
believed
gazing
on
a
blank
bare
space
the
chair
was
still
there
but
the
wizard
was
gone

turned
to
me
horror
in

eyes

she
said

and
we
both
lost

the
true
state
of

case
flashed
on
our
minds

off

the
end
what
remains
to
be
told
is
of
little
public
interest
when
we
came
to
ourselves
all
was
darkness
escape
seemed
impossible
we
could
not
swarm
up
the
rope
by
the
way
we
had
come
we
knew
not
when
the
shaft
of
yellow
light
might
return
on
its
beat
we
lit
a
bryant
may
match
and
thereby
groped
our
way
downwards
ever
downwards
finally
as
we
had
given
up
all
for
lost
leonora
said
you
think
the
air
is
a
little
stuffy
we
sniffed
about
the
rocky
floor
and
found
an
iron
grating
it
yielded
to
a
strong
tug
and
we
descended
into
subterranean
passages
framed
by
the
art
of
men
through
which
rolled
and
surged
torrents
of
turbid
water
through
these
we
waded
attacked
by
armies
of
rats
till
thank
goodness
we
saw
a
moving
light
flashing
hither
and
thither
on
the
torrent
half
swimming
half
wading
we
reached
the
bearer
of
the
light
it
was
old
pellmelli
a
sanitary
special
as
he
told
us
we
somewhat
deceitfully
led
him
to
believe
that
we
had
lost
ourselves
on
a
similar
errand
for
a
rival

us

we
escaped
at

light
of
such
day
as
dwells
in
the
dark
city
our
hopes
now
entirely
rest
on
finding
jambres
again
but
it
may
be
of
course
a
good
three
or
four
thousand
years
before
that
here
this
strange
narrative
closes
and
as
i
end
my

i
have
only
one
question
to
ask
myself
will
this
thing
go
on

jambres

will
the
