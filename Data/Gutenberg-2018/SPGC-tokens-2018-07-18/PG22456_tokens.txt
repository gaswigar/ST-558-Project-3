the
text
the
aeneid
of
virgil
translated
into
english
by
mackail
fellow
of
balliol
college
oxford
london
macmillan
and
printed
by

preface
there
is
something
grotesque
in
the
idea
of
a
prose
translation
of
a
poet
though
the
practice
is
become
so
common
that
it
has
ceased
to
provoke
a
smile
or
demand
an
apology
the
language
of
poetry
is
language
in
fusion
that
of
prose
is
language
fixed
and
crystallised
and
an
attempt
to
copy
the
one
material
in
the
other
must
always
count
on
failure
to
convey
what
is
after
all
one
of
the
most
essential
things
in
poetry
its
poetical
quality
and
this
is
so
with
virgil
more
perhaps
than
with
any
other
poet
for
more
perhaps
than
any
other
poet
virgil
depends
on
his
poetical
quality
from
first
to
last
such
a
translation
can
only
have
the
value
of
a
copy
of
some
great
painting
executed
in
mosaic
if
indeed
a
copy
in
berlin
wool
is
not
a
closer
analogy
and
even
at
the
best
all
it
can
have
to
say
for
itself
will
be
in
virgil
own
words
sensus
nihil
hic
nisi
carmina
in
this
translation
i
have
in
the
main
followed
the
text
of
conington
and
nettleship
the
more
important
deviations
from
this
text
are
mentioned
in
the
notes
but
i
have
not
thought
it
necessary
to
give
a
complete
list
of
various
readings
or
to
mention
any
change
except
where
it
might
lead
to
misapprehension
their
notes
have
also
been
used
by
me
throughout
beyond
this
i
have
made
constant
use
of
the
mass
of
ancient
commentary
going
under
the
name
of
servius
the
most
valuable
perhaps
of
all
as
it
is
in
many
ways
the
nearest
to
the
poet
himself
the
explanation
given
in
it
has
sometimes
been
followed
against
those
of
the
modern
editors
to
other
commentaries
only
occasional
reference
has
been
made
the
sense
that
virgil
is
his
own
best
interpreter
becomes
stronger
as
one
studies
him
more
my
thanks
are
due
to
evelyn
abbott
fellow
and
tutor
of
balliol

to

much
valuable
suggestion
and
criticism

the
man
who
of
old
from
the
coasts
of
troy
came
an
exile
of
fate
to
italy
and
the
shore
of
lavinium
hard
driven
on

and
on
the
deep
by
the
violence
of

for
cruel
juno
unforgetful
anger
and
hard
bestead
in
war
also
ere
he
might
found
a
city
and
carry
his
gods
into
latium
from
whom
is
the
latin
race
the
lords

alba
and
the
stately
city
rome
muse
tell
me
why
for
what
attaint
of
her
deity
or
in
what
vexation
did
the
queen
of
heaven
drive
one
so
excellent
in
goodness
to
circle
through
so
many
afflictions
to
face
so
many
toils
is
anger
so
fierce
in
celestial
spirits
there
was
a
city
of
ancient
days
that
tyrian
settlers
dwelt
in
carthage
over
against
italy
and
the
tiber
mouths
afar
rich
of
store
and
mighty
in
war
fierce
pursuits
wherein
they
say
alone
beyond
all
other
lands
had
juno
her
seat
and
held
samos
itself
less
dear
here
was
her
armour
here
her
chariot
even
now
if
fate
permit
the
goddess
strives
to
nurture
it
for
queen
of
the
nations
nevertheless
she
had
heard
a
race
was
issuing
of
the
blood
of
troy
which
sometime
should
overthrow
her
tyrian
citadel
from
it
should
come
a
people
lord
of
lands
and
tyrannous
in
war
the
destroyer
of
libya
so
rolled
the
destinies
fearful
of
that
the
daughter
of
saturn
the
old
war
in
her
remembrance
that
she
fought
at
troy
for
her
beloved
argos
long
ago
nor
had
the
springs
of
her
anger
nor
the
bitterness
of
her
vexation
yet
gone
out
of
mind
deep
stored
in
her
soul
lies
the
judgment
of
paris
the
insult
of
her
slighted
beauty
the
hated
race
and
the
dignities
of
ravished
ganymede
fired
with
this
also
she
tossed
all
over
ocean
the
trojan
remnant
left
of
the
greek
host
and
merciless
achilles
and
held
them
afar
from
latium
and
many
a
year
were
they
wandering
driven
of
fate
around
all
the
seas
such
work
was
it
to
found
the
roman
people
hardly
out

of
the
land
of
sicily

they
set
their
sails
to

merrily
upturned

salt
foam
with

prow

juno
the
undying
wound
still

thus
broke
out
alone

whether

how
his

outgone
all

from

sometime
in

from

flying

sail
from
the
tyrian
town
long
is
the
tale
of
crime
long
and
intricate
but
i
will
briefly
follow
its
argument
her
husband
was
sychaeus
wealthiest
in
lands
of
the
phoenicians
and
loved
of
her
with
passion
to
whom
with
virgin
rites
her
father
had
given
her
maidenhood
in
wedlock
but
the
kingdom
of
tyre
was
in
her
brother
pygmalion
hands
a
monster
of
guilt
unparalleled
between
these
madness
came
the
unnatural
brother
blind
with
lust
of
gold
and
reckless
of
his
sister
love
lays
sychaeus
low
before
the
altars
with
stealthy
unsuspected
weapon
and
for
long
he
hid
the
deed
and
by
many
a
crafty
pretence
cheated
her
with
hollow
hope
but
in
slumber
came
the
very
ghost
of
her
unburied
husband
lifting
up
a
face
pale
in
wonderful
wise
he
exposed
the
merciless
altars
and
his
breast
stabbed
through
with
steel
and
unwove
all
the
blind
web
of
household
guilt
then
he
counsels
hasty
flight
out
of
the
country
and
to
aid
her
passage
discloses
treasures
long
hidden
underground
an
untold
mass
of

thereby
dido

them

thy

stooping
from
the
tract

the

of

fluttered
over

in

train

seem
either
to
take
the

or
already
to
look
down
on
the
ground
they
took
as
they
again
disport
with
clapping
wings
and
utter
their
notes
as
they
circle
the
sky
in
company
even
so
do
these

of
thine
either
lie
fast
in

or
glide
under
full

into

on

turn
thy
steps
where
the
pathway
leads
thee
speaking
she
turned
away
and
her
neck
shone
roseate
her
immortal
tresses
breathed
the
fragrance
of
deity
her
raiment
fell
flowing
down
to
her
feet
and
the
godhead
was
manifest
in
her
tread
he
knew
her
for
his
mother
and
with
this
cry
pursued
her
flight
also
merciless
why
mockest
thou
thy
son
so
often
in
feigned
likeness
why
is
it
forbidden
to
clasp
hand
in
hand
to
hear
and
utter
true
speech
thus
reproaching
her
he
bends
his
steps
towards
the
city
but
venus
girt
them
in
their
going
with
dull
mist
and
shed
round
them
a
deep
divine
clothing
of
cloud
that
none
might
see
them
none
touch
them
or
work
delay
or
ask
wherefore
they
came
herself
she
speeds
through
the
sky
to

joyfully
revisits
her
habitation
where
the
temple
and
its
hundred
altars
steam
with
sabaean
incense
and
are
fresh
with
fragrance
of
chaplets
in
her
worship
they

have
hasted
along
where
the

points
and
now
were
climbing
the

which
hangs
enormous
over
the

down
on

at

hot
at

to
trace
the

to

and
roll
up

stones
by

or
to
choose
a
spot
for

enclose
it
with
a
furrow
they

and

and
the

senate
here
some
are
digging
harbours
here
others
lay
the
deep
foundations
of
their
theatre
and
hew
out
of
the
cliff
vast
columns
the
lofty
ornaments
of
the
stage
to
be
even
as
bees
when
summer
is
fresh
over
the
flowery
country
ply
their
task
beneath
the
sun
when
they
lead
forth
their

brood

the
liquid
honey
and

their

with
nectarous
sweets
or

incomers
or
in

array

the

of
drones

from

swarm
over

deep
with

wherein
first
the

dug
up

meet
his

his
fears
first
here
did
aeneas
dare
to
hope
for
safety
and
have
fairer
trust
in
his
shattered
fortunes
for
while
he
closely
scans
the

that
towers
above
him
while
awaiting
the

he
admires
the
fortunate
city
the
emulous

and
elaborate
work
of

craftsmen
he
sees
ranged
in
order
the
battles
of

was
already
rumoured
through
all
the
world
the
sons
of

both
found
pitiless

here
mortal

touches
the
soul
to

dismiss
thy
fears
the
fame
of
this
will
somehow
bring
thee
salvation
so
speaks
he
and
fills
his
soul
with
the
painted
show
sighing
often
the
while
and
his
face
wet
with
a
full
river
of
tears
for
he
saw
how
warring
round
the
trojan
citadel
here
the
greeks
fled
the
men
of

hard
on

here

in

pressing

flight
not

away

the
snowy
canvas
of

which
betrayed
in
their
first
sleep
the
son
of
tydeus
laid
desolate
in
heaped
slaughter
and
turns
the
ruddy

along

thrown
back

with
his
empty
chariot
still
clutching
the
reins
his
neck
and
hair
are
dragged
over
the
ground
and
his
reversed
spear
scores
the
dust
meanwhile
the
ilian
women
went
with
disordered
tresses
to

and
bore
the
votive

beating

and

the
queen
entered
the
precinct
beautiful
exceedingly
a
youthful
train
thronging
round
her
even
as
on
banks
or
along
the
cynthian
ridges
diana
wheels
the
dance
while
behind
her
a
thousand
mountain
nymphs
crowd
to
left
and
right
she
carries
quiver
on
shoulder
and
as
she
moves
outshines
them
all
in
deity
latona
heart
is
thrilled
with
silent
joy
such
was
dido
so
she
joyously
advanced
amid
the
throng
urging
on
the
business
of
her
rising
empire
then
in
the
gates
of
the
goddess
beneath
the
central
vault
of
the
temple
roof
she
took
her
seat
girt
with
arms
and
high
enthroned
and
now
she
gave
justice
and
laws
to
her
people
and
adjusted
or
allotted
their
taskwork
in
due
portion
when
suddenly
aeneas
sees
advancing
with
a
great
crowd
about
them
antheus
and
sergestus
and
brave
cloanthus
and
other
of
his
trojans
whom
the
black
squall
had
sundered
at
sea
and
borne
far
away
on
the
coast
dizzy
with
the
shock
of
joy
and
fear
he
and
achates
together
were
on
fire
with
eagerness
to
clasp
their
hands
but
in
confused
uncertainty
they
keep
hidden
and
clothed
in
the
sheltering
cloud
wait
to
espy
what
fortune
befalls
them
where
they
are
leaving
their
fleet
ashore
why
they
now
come
for
they
advanced
chosen
men
from
all
the
ships
praying
for
grace
and
held
on
with
loud
cries
towards
the
temple
after
they
entered
in
and
free
speech
was
granted
aged
ilioneus
with
placid
mien
thus
began
to
whom
jupiter
hath
given
to
found
this
new
city
and
lay
the
yoke
of
justice
upon
haughty
tribes
we
beseech
thee
we
wretched
trojans
over
all
the
seas
stay
the
dreadful
flames
from
our
ships
spare
a
guiltless
race
and
bend
a
gracious
regard
on
our
fortunes
we
are
not
come
to
deal
slaughter
through
libyan
homes
or
to
drive
plundered
spoils
to
the
coast
such
violence
sits
not
in
our
mind
nor
is
a
conquered
people
so
insolent
there
is
a
place
greeks
name
hesperia
an
ancient
land
mighty
in
arms
and
foison
of
the
clod
oenotrian
men
dwelt
therein
now
rumour
is
that
a
younger
race
from
their
captain
name
have
called
it
italy
thither
lay
our
course
when
orion
rising
on
us
through
the
cloudrack
with
sudden
surf
bore
us
on
blind
shoals
and
scattered
us
afar
with
his
boisterous
gales
and
whelming
brine
over
waves
and
trackless
reefs
to
these
your
coasts
we
a
scanty
remnant
floated
up
what
race
of
men
what
land
how
barbarous
soever
allows
such
a
custom
for
its
own
we
are
debarred
the
shelter
of
the
beach
they
rise
in
war
and
forbid
us
to
set
foot
on
the
brink
of
their
land
if
you
slight
human
kinship
and
mortal
arms
yet
look
for
gods
unforgetful
of
innocence
and
guilt
aeneas
was
our
king
foremost
of
men
in
righteousness
incomparable
in
goodness
as
in
warlike
arms
whom
if
fate
still
preserves
if
he
draws
the
breath
of
heaven
and
lies
not
yet
low
in
dispiteous
gloom
fear
we
have
none
nor
mayest
thou
repent
of
challenging
the
contest
of

in
sicilian
territory

blood
grant
us
to
draw
ashore
our

to
shape
forest

into

and
strip
them
for
oars
so
if
to
italy
we
may
steer
with
our
king
and
comrades
found
italy
and
latium
shall
we
gladly
seek
but
if
salvation
is
clean
gone
if
the
libyan
gulf
holds
thee
dear
lord
of
thy
trojans
and
iülus
our
hope
survives
no
more
seek
we
then
at

the
straits
of
sicily
the
open
homes
whence
we
sailed
hither
and
acestes
for
our

thus
ilioneus

she
will
not
be
idle
in

i
counsel

makes
ready
at

summons
to
go
to
the

him
will
i
hide
deep
asleep
in

habitation
high
on

hills
or
in

that
he
may
not
know
nor
cross
our

do
thou
but
for
one
night
feign
his

and
boy
as
thou
art
put
on
the
familiar
face
of
a

so
when
in
festal
cheer
amid
royal
dainties
and
bacchic
juice
dido
shall
take
thee
to

shall
fold
thee
in

sows
the

in

and
disaccustomed
heart
soon
as
the
noise

ceased

war
and
beaten
back
by
fate
and
so
many
years
now
slid
away
the
grecian
captains
build
by
pallas
divine
craft
a
horse
of
mountainous
build
ribbed
with
sawn
fir
they
feign
it
vowed
for
their
return
and
this
rumour
goes
about
within
the
blind
sides
they
stealthily
imprison
chosen
men
picked
out
one
by
one
and
fill
the
vast
cavern
of
its
womb
full
with
armed
soldiery
lies
in
sight
an
island
well
known
in
fame
tenedos
rich
of
store
while
the
realm
of
priam
endured
now
but
a
bay
and
roadstead
treacherous
to
ships
hither
they
launch
forth
and
hide
on
the
solitary
shore
we
fancied
they
were
gone
and
had
run
down
the
wind
for
mycenae
so
all
the
teucrian
land
put
her
long
grief
away
the
gates
are
flung
open
men
go
rejoicingly
to
see
the
doric
camp
the
deserted
stations
and
abandoned
shore
here
the
dolopian
troops
were
tented
here
cruel
achilles
here
their
squadrons
lay
here
the
lines
were
wont
to
meet
in
battle
some
gaze
astonished
at
the
deadly
gift
of
minerva
the
virgin
and
wonder
at
the
horse
bulk
and
thymoetes
begins
to
advise
that
it
be
drawn
within
our
walls
and
set
in
the
citadel
whether
in
guile
or
that
the
doom
of
troy
was
even
now
setting
thus
but
capys
and
they
whose
mind
was
of
better
counsel
bid
us
either
hurl
sheer
into
the
sea
the
guileful
and
sinister
gift
of
greece
or
heap
flames
beneath
to
consume
it
or
pierce
and
explore
the
hollow
of
its
womb
the
wavering
crowd
is
torn
apart
in
high
dispute
that
foremost
of
all
and
with
a
great
throng
about
him
laocoön
runs
hotly
down
from
the
high
citadel
and
cries
from
far
ah
wretched
citizens
what
height
of
madness
is
this
believe
you
the
foe
is
gone
or
think
you
any
grecian
gift
is
free
of
treachery
is
it
thus
we
know
ulysses
either
achaeans
are
hid
in
this
cage
of
wood
or
the
engine
is
fashioned
against
our
walls
to
overlook
the
houses
and
descend
upon
the
city
some
delusion
lurks
there
trust
not
the
horse
o
trojans
be
it
what
it
may
i
fear
the
grecians
even
when
they
offer
gifts
thus
speaking
he
hurled
his
mighty
spear
with
great
strength
at
the
creature
side
and
the
curved
framework
of
the
belly
the
spear
stood
quivering
and
the
jarred
cavern
of
the
womb
sounded
hollow
and
uttered
a
groan
and
had
divine
ordinance
had
a
soul
not
infatuate
been
with
us
he
had
moved
us
to
lay
violent
steel
on
the
argolic
hiding
place
and
troy
would
now
stand
and
you
tall
towers
of
priam
yet
abide
dardanian
shepherds
meanwhile
dragged
clamorously
before
the
king
a
man
with
hands
tied
behind
his
back
who
to
compass
this
very
thing
to
lay
troy
open
to
the
achaeans
had
gone
to
meet
their
ignorant
approach
confident
in
spirit
and
doubly
prepared
to
spin
his
snares
or
to
meet
assured
death
from
all
sides
in
eagerness
to
see
the
people
of
troy
run
streaming
in
and
vie
in
jeers
at
their
prisoner
know
now
the
treachery
of
the
grecians
and
from
a
single
crime
learn
all
for
as
he
stood
amid
our
gaze
confounded
disarmed
and
cast
his
eyes
around
the
phrygian
columns
alas
he
cried
what
land
now
what
seas
may
receive
me
or
what
is
the
last
doom
that
yet
awaits
my
misery
who
have
neither
any
place
among
the
grecians
and
likewise
the
dardanians
clamour
in
wrath
for
the
forfeit
of
my
blood
at
that
lament
our
spirit
was
changed
and
all
assault
stayed
we
encourage
him
to
speak
and
tell
of
what
blood
he
is
sprung
or
what
assurance
he
brings
his
captors
in
all
things
assuredly
says
he
o
king
befall
what
may
i
will
confess
to
thee
the
truth
nor
will
i
deny
myself
of
argolic
birth
this
first
nor
if
fortune
hath
made
sinon
unhappy
shall
her
malice
mould
him
to
a
cheat
and
a
liar
hath
a
tale
of
the
name
of
palamedes
son
of
belus
haply
reached
thine
ears
and
of
his
glorious
rumour
and
renown
whom
under
false
evidence
the
pelasgians
because
he
forbade
the
war
sent
innocent
to
death
by
wicked
witness
now
they
bewail
him
when
he
hath
left
the
light
in
his
company
being
near
of
blood
my
father
poor
as
he
was
sent
me
hither
to
arms
from
mine
earliest
years
while
he
stood
unshaken
in
royalty
and
potent
in
the
councils
of
the
kings
we
too
wore
a
name
and
honour
when
by
subtle
ulysses
malice
no
unknown
tale
do
i
tell
he
left
the
upper
regions
my
shattered
life
crept
on
in
darkness
and
grief
inly
indignant
at
the
fate
of
my
innocent
friend
nor
in
my
madness
was
i
silent
and
should
any
chance
offer
did
i
ever
return
a
conqueror
to
my
native
argos
i
vowed
myself
his
avenger
and
with
my
words
i
stirred
his
bitter
hatred
from
this
came
the
first
taint
of
ill
from
this
did
ulysses
ever
threaten
me
with
fresh
charges
from
this
flung
dark
sayings
among
the
crowd
and
sought
confederate
arms
nay
nor
did
he
rest
till
by
calchas
service
but
yet
why
do
i
vainly
unroll
the
unavailing
tale
or
why
hold
you
in
delay
if
all
achaeans
are
ranked
together
in
your
mind
and
it
is
enough
that
i
bear
the
name
take
the
vengeance
deferred
this
the
ithacan
would
desire
and
the
sons
of
atreus
buy
at
a
great
ransom
indeed
we
press
on
to
ask
and
inquire
the
cause
witless
of
wickedness
so
great
and
pelasgian
craft
tremblingly
the
one
pursues
his
speech
often
would
the
grecians
have
taken
to
flight
leaving
troy
behind
and
disbanded
in
weariness
of
the
long
war
and
would
god
they
had
as
often
the
fierce
barred
their
way
and
the
gale
frightened
them
from
going
most
of
all
when
this
horse
already
stood
framed
with
beams
of
maple
storm
clouds
roared
over
all
the
sky
in
perplexity
we
send
eurypylus
to
inquire
of
phoebus
oracle
and
he
brings
back
from
the
sanctuary
these
words
of
terror
blood
of
a
slain
maiden
o
grecians
you
appeased
the
winds
when
first
you
came
to
the
ilian
coasts
with
blood
must
you
seek
your
return
and
an
argive
life
be
the
accepted
when
that
utterance
reached
the
ears
of
the
crowd
their
hearts
stood
still
and
a
cold
shudder
ran
through
their
inmost
sense
for
whom
is
doom
purposed
who
is
claimed
of
apollo
at
this
the
ithacan
with
loud
clamour
drags
calchas
the
soothsayer
forth
amidst
them
and
demands
of
him
what
is
this
the
gods
signify
and
now
many
an
one
foretold
me
the
villain
craft
and
cruelty
and
silently
saw
what
was
to
come
twice
five
days
he
is
speechless
in
his
tent
and
will
not
have
any
one
denounced
by
his
lips
or
given
up
to
death
scarcely
at
last
at
the
loud
urgence
of
the
ithacan
he
breaks
into
speech
as
was
planned
and
appoints
me
for
the
altar
all
consented
and
each
one
particular
fear
was
turned
ah
me
to
my
single
destruction
and
now
the
dreadful
day
was
at
hand
the
rites
were
being
ordered
for
me
the
salted
corn
and
the
chaplets
to
wreathe
my
temples
i
broke
away
i
confess
it
from
death
i
burst
my
bonds
and
lurked
all
night
darkling
in
the
sedge
of
the
marshy
pool
till
they
might
set
their
sails
if
haply
they
should
set
them
nor
have
i
any
hope
more
of
seeing
my
old
home
nor
my
sweet
children
and
the
father
whom
i
desire
of
them
will
they
even
haply
claim
vengeance
for
my
flight
and
wash
away
this
crime
in
their
wretched
death
by
the
heavenly
powers
i
beseech
thee
the
deities
to
whom
truth
is
known
by
all
the
faith
yet
unsullied
that
is
anywhere
left
among
mortals
pity
woes
so
great
pity
an
undeserving
sufferer
these
his
tears
we
grant
him
life
and
accord
our
pity
priam
himself
at
once
commands
his
shackles
and
strait
bonds
to
be
undone
and
thus
speaks
with
kindly
words
whoso
thou
art
now
and
henceforth
dismiss
and
forget
the
greeks
thou
shalt
be
ours
and
unfold
the
truth
to
this
my
question
wherefore
have
they
reared
this
vast
size
of
horse
who
is
their
counsellor
or
what
their
aim
what
propitiation
or
what
engine
of
war
is
this
he
ended
the
other
stored
with
the
treacherous
craft
of
pelasgia
lifts
to
heaven
his
freed
hands
you
everlasting
fires
he
cries
and
your
inviolable
sanctity
be
my
witness
you
o
altars
and
accursed
swords
i
fled
and
chaplets
of
the
gods
i
wore
as
victim
unblamed
may
i
break
the
oath
of
greek
allegiance
unblamed
hate
them
and
bring
all
to
light
that
they
conceal
nor
am
i
bound
by
any
laws
of
country
do
thou
only
keep
by
thy
promise
o
troy
and
preserve
faith
with
thy
preserver
as
my
news
shall
be
true
as
my
recompense
great
all
the
hope
of
greece
and
the
confidence
in
which
the
war
began
ever
centred
in
pallas
aid
but
since
the
wicked
son
of
tydeus
and
ulysses
forger
of
crime
made
bold
to
tear
the
fated
palladium
from
her
sanctuary
and
cut
down
the
sentries
on
the
towered
height
since
they
grasped
the
holy
image
and
dared
with
bloody
hands
to
touch
the
maiden
chaplets
of
the
goddess
since
then
the
hope
of
greece
ebbed
and
slid
away
backwards
their
strength
was
broken
and
the
mind
of
the
goddess
estranged
whereof
the
tritonian
gave
token
by
no
uncertain
signs
scarcely
was
the
image
set
in
the
camp
flame
shot
sparkling
from
its
lifted
eyes
and
salt
sweat
started
over
its
body
thrice
wonderful
to
tell
it
leapt
from
the
ground
with
shield
and
spear
quivering
immediately
calchas
prophesies
that
the
seas
must
be
explored
in
flight
nor
may
troy
towers
be
overthrown
by
argive
weapons
except
they
repeat
their
auspices
at
argos
and
bring
back
that
divine
presence
they
have
borne
away
with
them
in
the
curved
ships
overseas
and
now
they
have
run
down
the
wind
for
their
native
mycenae
to
gather
arms
and
gods
to
attend
them
they
will
remeasure
ocean
and
be
on
you
unawares
so
calchas
expounds
the
omens
this
image
at
his
warning
they
reared
in
recompense
for
the
palladium
and
the
injured
deity
to
expiate
the
horror
of
sacrilege
yet
calchas
bade
them
raise
it
to
this
vast
size
with
oaken
crossbeams
and
build
it
up
to
heaven
that
it
may
not
find
entry
at
the
gates
nor
be
drawn
within
the
city
nor
protect
your
people
beneath
the
consecration
of
old
for
if
hand
of
yours
should
violate
minerva
offering
then
utter
destruction
the
gods
turn
rather
on
himself
his
augury
should
be
upon
priam
empire
and
the
phrygian
people
but
if
under
your
hands
it
climbed
into
your
city
asia
should
advance
in
mighty
war
to
the
walls
of
pelops
and
a
like
fate
awaited
our
children
children
by
sinon
wiles
and
craft
and
perjury
the
thing
gained
belief
and
we
were
ensnared
by
treachery
and
forced
tears
we
whom
neither
the
son
of
tydeus
nor
achilles
of
larissa
whom
not
ten
years
nor
a
thousand
ships
brought
down
another
sight
greater
alas
and
far
more
terrible
meets
us
and
alarms
our
thoughtless
senses
laocoön
allotted
priest
of
neptune
was
slaying
a
great
bull
at
the
accustomed
altars
and
lo
from
tenedos
over
the
placid
depths
i
shudder
as
i
recall
two
snakes
in
enormous
coils
press
down
the
sea
and
advance
together
to
the
shore
their
breasts
rise
through
the
surge
and
their
crests
overtop
the
waves
the
rest
trails
through
the
main
behind
and
wreathes
back
in
voluminous
curves
the
brine
gurgles
and
foams
and
now
they
gained
the
fields
while
their
bloodshot
eyes
blazed
with
fire
and
their
tongues
lapped
and
flickered
in
their
hissing
mouths
we
scatter
pallid
at
the
sight
they
in
unfaltering
train
make
towards
laocoön
and
first
the
serpents
twine
in
their
double
embrace
his
two
little
children
and
bite
deep
in
their
wretched
limbs
then
him
likewise
as
he
comes
up
to
help
with
arms
in
his
hand
they
seize
and
fasten
in
their
enormous
coils
and
now
twice
clasping
his
waist
twice
encircling
his
neck
with
their
scaly
bodies
they
tower
head
and
neck
above
him
he
at
once
strains
his
hands
to
tear
their
knots
apart
his
fillets
spattered
with
foul
black
venom
at
once
raises
to
heaven
awful
cries
as
when
bellowing
a
bull
shakes
the
wavering
axe
from
his
neck
and
runs
wounded
from
the
altar
but
the
two
snakes
glide
away
to
the
high
sanctuary
and
seek
the
fierce
tritonian
citadel
and
take
shelter
under
the
goddess
feet
beneath
the
circle
of
her
shield
then
indeed
a
strange
terror
thrills
in
all
our
amazed
breasts
and
laocoön
men
say
hath
fulfilled
his
crime
desert
in
piercing
the
consecrated
wood
and
hurling
his
guilty
spear
into
its
body
all
cry
out
that
the
image
must
be
drawn
to
its
home
and
supplication
made
to
her
deity
we
sunder
the
walls
and
lay
open
the
inner
city
all
set
to
the
work
they
fix
rolling
wheels
under
its
feet
and
tie
hempen
bands
on
its
neck
the
fated
engine
climbs
our
walls
big
with
arms
around
it
boys
and
unwedded
girls
chant
hymns
and
joyfully
lay
their
hand
on
the
rope
it
moves
up
and
glides
menacing
into
the
middle
of
the
town
o
native
land
o
ilium
house
of
gods
and
dardanian
city
renowned
in
war
four
times
in
the
very
gateway
did
it
come
to
a
stand
and
four
times
armour
rang
in
its
womb
yet
we
urge
it
on
mindless
and
infatuate
and
plant
the
thing
in
our
hallowed
citadel
even
then
cassandra
opens
her
lips
to
the
coming
doom
lips
at
a
god
bidding
never
believed
by
the
trojans
we
the
wretched
people
to
whom
that
day
was
our
last
hang
the
shrines
of
the
gods
with
festal
boughs
throughout
the
city
meanwhile
the
heavens
wheel
on
and
night
rises
from
the
sea
wrapping
in
her
vast
shadow
earth
and
sky
and
the
wiles
of
the
myrmidons
about
the
town
the
teucrians
are
stretched
in
silence
slumber
laps
their
tired
limbs
now
the
argive
squadron
was
sailing
in
order
from
tenedos
and
in
the
favouring
stillness
of
the
quiet
moon
sought
the
shores
it
knew
when
the
royal
galley
ran
out
a
flame
and
protected
by
the
malign
decrees
sinon
stealthily
lets
loose
the
imprisoned
grecians
from
their
barriers
of
pine
the
horse
opens
and
restores
them
to
the
air
and
joyfully
issuing
from
the
hollow
wood
thessander
and
sthenelus
the
captains
and
terrible
ulysses
slide
down
the
dangling
rope
with
acamas
and
thoas
and
neoptolemus
son
of
peleus
and
machaon
first
of
all
and
menelaus
and
epeüs
himself
the
artificer
of
the
treachery
they
sweep
down
the
city
buried
in
drunken
sleep
the
watchmen
are
cut
down
and
at
the
open
gates
they
welcome
all
their
comrades
and
unite
their
confederate
bands
was
the
time
when
by
the
gift
of
god
rest
comes
stealing
first
and
sweetest
on
unhappy
men
in
slumber
lo
before
mine
eyes
hector
seemed
to
stand
by
deep
in
grief
and
shedding
abundant
tears
torn
by
the
chariot
as
once
of
old
and
black
with
gory
dust
his
swoln
feet
pierced
with
the
thongs
ah
me
in
what
guise
was
he
how
changed
from
the
hector
who
returns
from
putting
on
achilles
spoils
or
launching
the
fires
of
phrygia
on
the
grecian
ships
with
ragged
beard
and
tresses
clotted
with
blood
and
all
the
many
wounds
upon
him
that
he
received
around
his
ancestral
walls
myself
too
weeping
i
seemed
to
accost
him
ere
he

mournful
accents

o

what

this

held
thee
from

comest
thou

our

with
what
weary
eyes
we
see
thee
after
many
deaths
of

after
divers
woes
of

what
indignity
hath
marred
thy
serene
visage
or
why

he
replies
naught
nor

my
idle
questioning
but
heavily
drawing
a

ah
fly
he
says

rescue
thyself
from

the

holds
our

from

troy
is
toppling
down
thy

priam
ask
no

if

might
be

by

this

too
had
been
their

troy
commends
to
thee
her

take
them

accompany
thy

seek
for
them
a
city
which
after
all
the

have
known
thy
wanderings
thou
shalt
at

establish
in
might
so
speaks
he
and
carries
forth
in
his
hands
from
their
inner
shrine
the
chaplets
and
strength
of
vesta
and
the
everlasting
fire
the
city
is
stirred
with
mingled
agony
and
more
and
more
though
my

anchises

lay
deep
withdrawn
and
screened
by

the
noises
grow
clearer
and
the
clash
of

swells
i
shake
myself
from

and
mount
over
the

and
stand
there
with

attent

as

the
treachery
of
the
grecians

out

down

my

for

drive
me
headlong

panthus

runs
distractedly
towards

how

what

scarcely

the

son

your

to
a
burning
city
let
us
die
and
rush
on
their
encircling
weapons
the
conquered
have
one
safety
to
hope
for
none
their
spirit
is
heightened
to
fury
then
like
wolves
ravening
in
a
black
fog
whom
mad
malice
of
hunger
hath
driven
blindly
forth
and
their
cubs
left
behind
await
with
throats
unslaked
through
the
weapons
of
the
enemy
we
march
to
certain
death
and
hold
our
way
straight
into
the

night
sheltering
shadow
flutters
dark
around
us
who
may
unfold
in
speech
that
night
horror
and
or
measure
its
woes
in
weeping
the
ancient
city
falls
with
her
long
years
of
sovereignty
corpses
lie
stretched
stiff
all
about
the
streets
and
houses
and
awful
courts
of
the

nor
do
teucrians
alone
pay
forfeit
of
their
blood
once
and
again
valour
returns
even
in
conquered
hearts
and
the
victorious
grecians
fall
everywhere
is
cruel
agony
everywhere
terror
and
the
sight
of
death
at
every
turn
with
a
great
troop
of
grecians
attending
him
androgeus
meets
us
taking
us
in
ignorance
for
an
allied
band
and
opens
on
us
with
friendly
words
hasten
my
men
why
idly
linger
so
late
others
plunder
and
harry
the
burning
citadel
are
you
but
now
on
your
march
from
the
tall
ships
he
spoke
and
immediately
for
no
answer
of
any
assurance
was
offered
knew
he
was
fallen
among
the
foe
in
amazement
he
checked
foot
and
voice
even
as
one
who
struggling
through
rough
briers
hath
trodden
a
snake
on
the
ground
unwarned
and
suddenly
shrinks
fluttering
back
as
it
rises
in
anger
and
puffs
its
green
throat
out
even
thus
androgeus
drew
away
startled
at
the
sight
we
rush
in
and
encircle
them
with
serried
arms
and
cut
them
down
dispersedly
in
their
ignorance
of
the
ground
and
seizure
of
panic
fortune
speeds
our
first
labour
and
here
coroebus
flushed
with
success
and
spirit
cries
o
comrades
follow
me
where
fortune
points
before
us
the
path
of
safety
and
shews
her
favour
let
us
exchange
shields
and
accoutre
ourselves
in
grecian
suits
whether
craft
or
courage
who
will
ask
of
an
enemy
the
foe
shall
arm
our
hands
thus
speaking
he
next
dons
the
plumed
helmet
and
beautifully
blazoned
shield
of
androgeus
and
fits
the
argive
sword
to
his
side
so
does
rhipeus
so
dymas
in
like
wise
and
all
our
men
in
delight
arm
themselves
one
by
one
in
the
fresh
spoils
we
advance
mingling
with
the
grecians
under
a
protection
not
our
own
and
join
many
a
battle
with
those
we
meet
amid
the
blind
night
many
a
greek
we
send
down
to
hell
some
scatter
to
the
ships
and
run
for
the
safety
of
the
shore
some
in
craven
fear
again
climb
the
huge
horse
and
hide
in
the
belly
they
knew
alas
that
none
may
trust
at
all

maiden
daughter
of

straining
to

blazing
eyes
in
vain
her
eyes
for
fetters
locked
her
delicate
hands
at
this
sight
coroebus
burst
forth
infuriate
and
flung
himself
on
death
amid
their
columns
we
all
follow
him
up
and
charge
with
massed
arms
here
first
from
the
high
temple
roof
we
are
overwhelmed
with
our
own
people
weapons
and
a
most
pitiful
slaughter
begins
through
the
fashion
of
our
armour
and
the
mistaken
greek
crests
then
the
grecians
with
angry
cries
at
the
maiden
rescue
gather
from
every
side
and
fall
on
us
ajax
in
all
his
valour
and
the
two
sons
of
atreus
and
the
whole
dolopian
army
as
oft
when
bursting
in
whirlwind

his

appear
whom
our
stratagem
routed
through
the
darkness
of
dim
night
and
drove
all
about
the
town
at
once

know
the

on

by

at

as
if
all
the
rest
of
the
fighting
were
nowhere
and
no
slaughter
but
here
throughout
the
city
so
do
we
descry
the
war
in
full
fury
the
grecians
rushing
on
the
building
and
their
shielded
column

up
against
the
beleaguered
threshold

by

doors

planted
on

rungs

hold
up
their
shields
in
the

hand
to
ward
off

with
their
right
clutch

down

they

doorway
giving
passage
through
the
range
of
halls
by
a
solitary
postern
whereby
while
our
realm
endured
hapless
andromache
would
often
and
often
glide
unattended
to
her
house
and
carry
the
boy
astyanax
to
his
grandsire
i
issue
out
on
the
sloping
height
of
the
ridge
whence
wretched
teucrian
hands
were
hurling
their
ineffectual
weapons
a
tower
stood
on
the
sheer
brink
its
roof
ascending
high
into
heaven
whence
was
wont
to
be
seen
all
troy
and
the
grecian
ships
and
achaean
camp
attacking
it
with
iron
round
about
where
the
joints
of
the
lofty
flooring
yielded

wrench
it
from
its
deep
foundations
and
shake
it
free
it
gives
way
and
suddenly
falls
thundering
in
ruin
crashing
wide
over
the
grecian
ranks
but
others
swarm
up
nor
meanwhile
do
stones
nor
any
sort
of
missile
slacken
right
before
the
vestibule
and
in
the
front
doorway
pyrrhus
moves
rejoicingly
in
the
sparkle
of
arms
and
gleaming
brass
like
as
when
a
snake
fed
on
poisonous
herbs
whom
chill
winter
kept
hid
and
swollen
underground
now
fresh
from
his
weeds
outworn
and
shining
in
youth
wreathes
his
slippery
body
into
the
daylight
his
upreared
breast
meets
the
sun
and
his
tongue
flickers
in
his
mouth

him

periphas

grasps
a
poleaxe
bursts
through
the
hard
doorway
and
wrenches
the
doors
from
the
hinge
and
now
he
hath
cut
out
a
plank
from
the
solid
oak
and
pierced
a
vast
gaping
hole
the

open

with
shrieks

deep
with

the
golden
stars

smitten
with
the
din
affrighted
mothers
stray
about

through

so

the
hope
of
his

children
their

magnificent
with
spoils
of
barbaric
gold
have
sunk
in
ruin
where
the
fire
fails
the
greeks
are
in

too
thou
mayest
inquire
what
was
priam
fate
when
he
saw
the
ruin
of
his
captured
city
the
gates
of
his
house
burst
open
and
the
enemy
amid
his
innermost
chambers
the
old
man
idly
fastens
round
his
aged
trembling
shoulders
his
long
disused
armour
girds
on
the
unavailing
sword
and
advances
on
his
death
among
the
thronging
foe
the
palace
and
under
the
bare
cope
of
sky
was
a
massive
altar
and
hard
on
the
altar
an
ancient
bay
tree
leaned
clasping
the
household
gods
in
its
shadow
here
hecuba
and
her
daughters
crowded
vainly
about
the
like
doves
driven
headlong
by
a
black
tempest
and
crouched
clasping
the
gods
images
and
when
she
saw
priam
her
lord
with
the
armour
of
youth
on
him
what
spirit
of
madness
my
poor
husband
she
cries
hath
stirred
thee
to
gird
on
these
weapons
or
whither
dost
thou
run
not
such
the

nor

the
defenders
the

own

now
beside
us
retire
i
beseech
thee
hither
this
altar
will
protect
us
all
or
thou
wilt
share
our
death
with
these
words
on
her
lips
she
drew
the
aged
man
to
her
and
set
him
on
the
holy
seat
lo
escaped
from
slaughtering
pyrrhus
through
the
weapons
of
the
enemy
polites
one
of

children
flies
wounded
down
the
long
colonnades
and
circles
the
empty
halls
pyrrhus
pursues
him
fiercely
with
aimed
wound
just
catching
at
him
and
follows
hard
on
him
with
his
spear
as
at
last
he
issued
before
his
parents
eyes
and
faces
he
fell
and
shed
his
life
in
a
pool
of
blood
at
this
priam
although
even
now
fast
in
the
toils
of
death
yet
withheld
not
nor
spared
a
wrathful
cry
ah
for
thy
crime
for
this
thy
hardihood
may
the
gods
if
there
is
goodness
in
heaven
to
care
for
aught
such
pay
thee
in
full
thy
worthy
meed
and
return
thee
the
reward
that
is
due
who
hast
made
me
look
face
to
face
on
my
child
murder
and
polluted
a

countenance
with
death
ah
not
such
to
a
foe
was
the

whose
parentage
thou
beliest
but
he
revered
a
suppliant
right
and
trust
restored
to
the
tomb
hector
pallid
corpse
and
sent
me
back
to
my
realm
thus
the
old
man
spoke
and
launched
his
weak
and
unwounding
spear
which
recoiling
straight
from
the
jarring
brass
hung
idly
from
his
shield
above
the
boss
thereat
pyrrhus
thou
then
shalt
tell
this
and
go
with
the
message
to
my
sire
the
son
of
peleus
remember
to
tell
him
of
my
baleful
deeds
and
the
degeneracy
of
neoptolemus
now
die
so
saying
he
drew
him
quivering
to
the
very
altar
slipping
in
the
pool
of
his
child
blood
and
wound
his
left
hand
in
his
hair
while
in
his
right
the
sword
flashed
out
and
plunged
to
the
hilt
in
his
side
this
was
the
end
of
priam
fortunes
thus
did
allotted
fate
find
him
with
burning
troy
and
her
sunken
towers
before
his
eyes
once
magnificent
lord
over
so
many
peoples
and
lands
of
asia
the
great
corpse
lies
along
the
shore
a
head
severed
from
the
shoulders
and
a
body
without
a
name
then
an
awful
terror
began
to
encircle
me
i
stood
in
amaze
there
rose
before
me
the
likeness
of
my
loved
father
as
i
saw
the
king
old
as
he
sobbing
out
his
life
under
the
ghastly
wound
there
rose
creüsa
forlorn
my
plundered
house
and
little
iülus
peril
i
look
back
and
survey
what
force
is
around
me
all
outwearied
have
given
up
and
leapt
headlong
to
the
ground
or
flung
themselves
wretchedly
into
the
fire
and
now
i
only
was
left
when
i
espy
the
daughter
of
tyndarus
close
in
the
courts
of
vesta
crouching
silently
in
the
fane
recesses
the
bright
glow
of
the
fires
lights
my
wandering
as
my
eyes
stray
all
about
fearing
the
teucrians
anger
for
the
overthrown
towers
of
troy
and
the
grecians
vengeance
and
the
wrath
of
the
husband
she
had
abandoned
she
the
common
fury
of
troy
and
her
native
country
had
hidden
herself
and
cowered
unseen
by
the
altars
my
spirit
kindles
to
fire
and
rises
in
wrath
to
avenge
my
dying
land
and
take
repayment
for
her
crimes
shall
she
verily
see
sparta
and
her
native
mycenae
unscathed
and
depart
a
queen
and
triumphant
shall
she
see
her
spousal
and
her
home
her
parents
and
children
attended
by
a
crowd
of
trojan
women
and
phrygians
to
serve
her
and
priam
have
fallen
under
the
sword
troy
blazed
in
fire
the
shore
of
dardania
so
often
soaked
with
blood
not
so
for
though
there
is
no
name
or
fame
in
a
woman
punishment
nor
honour
in
the
victory
yet
shall
i
have
praise
in
quenching
a
guilty
life
and
exacting
a
just
recompense
and
it
will
be
good
to
fill
my
soul
with
the
flame
of
vengeance
and
satisfy
the
ashes
of
my
people
thus
broke
i
forth
and
advanced
infuriate
when
my
mother
came
visibly
before
me
clear
to
sight
as
never
till
then
and
shone
forth
in
pure
radiance
through
the
night
gracious
evident
in
godhead
in
shape
and
stature
such
as
she
is
wont
to
appear
to
the
heavenly
people
she
caught
me
by
the
hand
and
stayed
me
and
pursued
thus
with
roseate
lips
son
what
overmastering
pain
thus
wakes
thy
wrath
why
ravest
thou
or
whither
is
thy
care
for
us
fled
wilt
thou
not
first
look
to
it
where
thou
hast
left
anchises
thine
aged
worn
father
or
if
creüsa
thy
wife
and
the
child
ascanius
survive
round
about
whom
all
the
greek
battalions
range
and
without
my
preventing
care
the
flames
ere
this
had
made
them
their
portion
and
the
hostile
sword
drunk
their
blood
not
the
hated
face
of
the
laconian
woman
tyndarus
daughter
not
paris
is
to
blame
the
gods
the
gods
in
anger
overturn
this
magnificence
and
make
troy
topple
down
look
for
all
the
cloud
that
now
veils
thy
gaze
and
dulls
mortal
vision
with
damp
encircling
mist
i
will
rend
from
before
thee
fear
thou
no
commands
of
thy
mother
nor
refuse
to
obey
her
counsels
here
where
thou
seest
sundered
piles
of
masonry
and
rocks
violently
torn
from
rocks
and
smoke
eddying
mixed
with
dust
neptune
with
his
great
trident

and

out
of
their
places

upturns
all
the
city
from
her
base

juno
in
all
her
terror
holds
the
scaean
gates
at
the
entry
and
girt
with
steel
calls
her
allied
army
furiously
from
their
ships
even
now
on

back
tritonian
pallas

the

against
the

haste
away
o
son
and
put
an
end
to
the
struggle
i
will
never
desert
thee
i
will
set
thee
safe
in
the
courts
of
thy
house
ended
and
plunged
in
the
dense
blackness
of
the
night
awful
faces
shine
forth
and
set
against
troy
divine
majesties
indeed
i
saw
all
ilium
sinking
in
flame
and
neptunian
troy
uprooted
from
her
base
even
as
an
ancient
ash
on
the
mountain
heights
hacked
all
about
with
steel
and
axes
when
husbandmen
emulously
strain
to
cut
it
down
it
hangs
threateningly
with
shaken
top
and
quivering
tresses
asway
till
gradually
overmastered
with
wounds
it
utters
one
last
groan
and
rending
itself
away
falls
in
ruin
along
the
ridge
i
descend
and
under
a
god
guidance
clear
my
way
between
foe
and

weapons
give
ground
before
me
and
flames
retire
now
when
i
have
reached
the
courts
of
my
ancestral
dwelling
our
home
of
old
my
father
whom
it
was
my
first
desire
to
carry
high
into
the
hills
and
whom
first
i
sought
declines
now
troy
is
rooted
out
to
prolong
his
life
through
the
pains
of
exile
ah
you
he
cries
whose
blood
is
at
the
prime
whose
strength
stands
firm
in
native
vigour
do
you
take
your
flight
had
the
lords
of
heaven
willed
to
prolong
life
for
me
they
should
have
preserved
this
my
home
enough
and
more
is
the
one
desolation
we
have
seen
survivors
of
a
captured
city
thus
oh
thus
salute
me
and
depart
as
a
body
laid
out
for
burial
mine
own
hand
shall
find
me
death
the
foe
will
be
merciful
and
seek
my
spoils
light
is
the
loss
of
a
tomb
this
long
time
hated
of
heaven
i
uselessly
delay
the
years
since
the
father
of
gods
and
king
of
men
blasted
me
with
wind
of
thunder
and
scathe
of
flame
held
he
on
in
utterance
and
remained
obstinate
we
press
him
dissolved
in
tears
my
wife
creüsa
ascanius
all
our
household
that
our
father
involve
us
not
all
in
his
ruin
and
add
his
weight
to
the
sinking
scale
of
doom
he
refuses
and
keeps
seated
steadfast
in
his
purpose
again
i
rush
to
battle
and
choose
death
in
my
misery
for
what
had
counsel
or
chance
yet
to
give
thoughtest
thou
my
feet
o
father
could
retire
and
abandon
thee
and
fell
so
unnatural
words
from
a
parent
lips
if
heaven
wills
that
naught
be
left
of
our
mighty
city
if
this
be
thy
planted
purpose
thy
pleasure
to
cast
in
thyself
and
thine
to
the
doom
of
troy
for
this
death
indeed
the
gate
is
wide
and
even
now
pyrrhus
will
be
here
newly
bathed
in
priam
blood
pyrrhus
who
slaughters
the
son
before

the
father
upon
his
altars
for
this

bountiful
mother
thou
dost
rescue
me
amid
fire
and
sword
to
see
the
foe
in
my
inmost
chambers
and
ascanius
and
my
father

by
their
side
hewn
down
in

arms
the
last

on
the
conquered
return
me
to
the
greeks
let
me
revisit
and
renew
the
fight
never
shall
we
all
perish
unavenged
i
again
gird
on
my
sword
and
fitting
my
left
arm
into
the
clasps
of
the
shield
strode
forth
of
the
palace
and
lo
my
wife
clung
round
my
feet
on
the
threshold
and
held
little
iülus
up
to
his
sight
if
thou
goest
to
die
let
us
too
hurry
with
thee
to
the
end
but
if
thou
knowest
any
hope
to
place
in
arms
be
this
household
thy
first
defence
to
what
is
little
iülus
and
thy
father
to
what
am
i
left
who
once
was
called
thy
wife
she
shrieked
and
filled
all
the
house
with
her
weeping
when
a
sign
arises
sudden
and
marvellous
to
tell
for
between
the
hands
and
before
the
faces
of
his
sorrowing
parents
lo
above
iülus
head
there
seemed
to
stream
a
light
luminous
cone
and
a
flame
whose
touch
hurt
not
to
flicker
in
his
soft
hair
and
play
round
his
brows
we
in
a
flutter
of
affright
shook
out
the
blazing
hair
and
quenched
the
holy
fires
with
spring
water
but
lord
anchises
joyfully
upraised
his
eyes
and
stretching
his
hands
to
heaven
jupiter
omnipotent
he
cries
if
thou
dost
relent
at
any
prayers
look
on
us
this
once
alone
and
if
our
goodness
deserve
it
give
thine
aid
hereafter
o
lord
and
confirm
this
thine
omen
had
the
aged
man
spoken
thus
when
with
sudden
crash
it
thundered
on
the
left
and
a
star
gliding
through
the
dusk
shot
from
heaven
drawing
a
bright
trail
of
light
we
watch
it
slide
over
the
palace
roof
leaving
the
mark
of
its
pathway
and
bury
its
brilliance
in
the
wood
of
ida
the
long
drawn
track
shines
and
the
region
all
about
fumes
with
sulphur
then
conquered
indeed
my
father
rises
to
address
the
gods
and
worship
the
holy
star
now
now
delay
is
done
with
i
follow
and
where
you
lead
i
come
gods
of
my
fathers
save
my
house
save
my
grandchild
yours
is
this
omen
and
in
your
deity
troy
stands
i
yield
o
my
son
and
refuse
not
to
go
in
thy
company
ended
and
now
more
loudly
the
fire
roars
along
the
city
and
the
burning
tides
roll
nearer
up
then
beloved
father
and
lean
on
my
neck
these
shoulders
of
mine
will
sustain
thee
nor
will
so
dear
a
burden
weigh
me
down
howsoever
fortune
fall
one
and
undivided
shall
be
our
peril
one
the
escape
of
us
twain
little
iülus
shall
go
along
with
me
and
my
wife
follow
our
steps
afar
you
of
my
household
give
heed
to
what
i
say
as
you
leave
the
city
there
is
a
mound
and
ancient
temple
of
ceres
lonely
on
it
and
hard
by
an
aged
cypress
guarded
many
years
in
ancestral
awe
to
this
let
us
gather
from
diverse
quarters
thou
o
father
take
the
sacred
things
and
the
household
gods
of
our
ancestors
in
thine
hand
for
me
just
parted
from
the
desperate
battle
with
slaughter
fresh
upon
me
to
handle
them
were
guilt
until
i
wash
away
in
a
living
stream
the
soilure
so
spoke
i
and
spread
over
my
neck
and
broad
shoulders
a
tawny
for
covering
and
stoop
to
my
burden
little
iülus
with
his
hand
fast
in
mine
keeps
uneven
pace
after
his
father
behind
my
wife
follows
we
pass
on
in
the
shadows
and
i
lately
moved
by
no
weapons
launched
against
me
nor
by
the
thronging
bands
of
my
grecian
foes
am
now
terrified
at
every
breath
startled
by
every
noise
thrilling
with
fear
alike
for
my
companion
and
my
burden
now
i
was
nearing
the
gates
and
thought
i
had
outsped
all
the
way
when
suddenly
the
crowded
trampling
of
feet
came
to
our
ears
and
my
father
looking
forth
into
the
darkness
cries
my
son
my
son
fly
they
draw
near
i
espy
the
gleaming
shields
and
the
flicker
of
brass
at
this
in
my
flurry
and
confusion
some
hostile
god
bereft
me
of
my
senses
for
while
i
plunge
down
byways
and
swerve
from
where
the
familiar
streets
ran
creüsa
alas
whether
torn
by
fate
from
her
unhappy
husband
she
stood
still
or
did
she
mistake
the
way
or
sink
down
outwearied
i
know
not
and
never
again
was
she
given
back
to
our
eyes
nor
did
i
turn
to
look
for
my
lost
one
or
cast
back
a
thought
ere
we
were
come
to
ancient
ceres
mound
and
hallowed
seat
here
at
last
when
all
gathered
one
was
missing
vanished
from
her
child
and
her
husband
company
what
man
or
god
did
i
spare
in
frantic
reproaches
or
what
crueller
sight
met
me
in
our
city
overthrow
i
charge
my
comrades
with
ascanius
and
lord
anchises
and
the
gods
of
teucria
hiding
them
in
the
winding
vale
myself
i
regain
the
city
girding
on
my
shining
armour
fixed
to
renew
every
danger
to
retrace
my
way
throughout
troy
and
fling
myself
again
on
its
perils
first
of
all
i
regain
the
walls
and
the
dim
gateway
whence
my
steps
had
issued
i
scan
and
follow
back
my
footprints
with
searching
gaze
in
the
night
everywhere
my
spirit
shudders
dismayed
at
the
very
silence
thence
i
pass
on
home
if
haply
her
feet
if
haply
had
led
her
thither
the
grecians
had
poured
in
and
filled
the
palace
the
devouring
fire
goes
rolling
before
the
wind
high
as
the
roof
the
flames
tower
over
it
and
the
heat
surges
up
into
the
air
i
move
on
and
revisit
the
citadel
and
priam
dwelling
where
now
in
the
spacious
porticoes
of
sanctuary
phoenix
and
accursed
ulysses
chosen
sentries
were
guarding
the
spoil
hither
from
all
quarters
is
flung
in
masses
the
treasure
of
troy
torn
from
burning
shrines
tables
of
the
gods
bowls
of
solid
gold
and
raiment
of
the
captives
boys
and
cowering
mothers
in
long
file
stand
round
yes
and
i
dared
to
cry
abroad
through
the
darkness
i
filled
the
streets
with
calling
and
again
and
yet
again
with
vain
reiterance
cried
piteously
on
creüsa
as
i
stormed
and
sought
her
endlessly
among
the
houses
of
the
town
there
rose
before
mine
eyes
a
melancholy
phantom
the
ghost
of
very
creüsa
in
likeness
larger
than
her
wont
i
was
motionless
my
hair
stood
up
and
the
accents
faltered
on
my
tongue
then
she
thus
addressed
me
and
with
this
speech
allayed
my
distresses
what
help
is
there
in
this
mad
passion
of
grief
sweet
my
husband
not
without
divine
influence
does
this
come
to
pass
nor
may
it
be
nor
does
the
high
lord
of
olympus
allow
that
thou
shouldest
carry
creüsa
hence
in
thy
company
long
shall
be
thine
exile
and
weary
spaces
of
sea
must
thou
furrow
through
and
thou
shalt
come
to
the
land
hesperia
where
lydian
tiber
flows
with
soft
current
through
rich
and
populous
fields
there
prosperity
awaits
thee
and
a
kingdom
and
a
king
daughter
for
thy
wife
dispel
these
tears
for
thy
beloved
creüsa
never
will
i
look
on
the
proud
homes
of
the
myrmidons
or
dolopians
or
go
to
be
the
slave
of
greek
matrons
i
a
daughter
of
dardania
a
of
venus
the
goddess
but
the
mighty
mother
of
the
gods
keeps
me
in
these
her
borders
and
now
farewell
and
still
love
thy
child
and
mine
this
speech
uttered
while
i
wept
and
would
have
said
many
a
thing
she
left
me
and
retreated
into
thin
air
thrice
there
was
i
fain
to
lay
mine
arms
round
her
neck
thrice
the
vision
i
vainly
clasped
fled
out
of
my
hands
even
as
the
light
breezes
or
most
like
to
fluttering
sleep
so
at
last
when
night
is
spent
i
revisit
my
comrades
here
i
find
a
marvellous
great
company
newly
flocked
in
mothers
and
men
a
people
gathered
for
exile
a
pitiable
crowd
from
all
quarters
they
are
assembled
ready
in
heart
and
fortune
to
whatsoever
land
i
will
conduct
them
overseas
and
now
the
morning
star
rose
over
the
high
ridges
of
ida
and
led
on
the
day
and
the
grecians
held
the
gateways
in
leaguer
nor
was
any
hope
of
help
given
i
withdrew
and
raising
my
father
up
i
sought
the
mountain
book
third
the
story
of
the
seven
years
wandering
heaven
lords
pleased
to
overthrow
the
state
of
asia
and
guiltless
people
and
proud
ilium
fell
and
neptunian
troy
smokes
all
along
the
ground
we
are
driven
by
divine
omens
to
seek
distant
places
of
exile
in
waste
lands
right
under
antandros
and
the
mountains
of
phrygian
ida
we
build
a
fleet
uncertain
whither
the
fates
carry
us
or
where
a
is
given
and
gather
the
people
together
scarcely
had
the
first
summer
set
in
when
lord
anchises
bids
us
spread
our
sails
to
fortune
and
weeping
i
leave
the
shores
and
havens
of
my
country
and
the
plains
where
once
was
troy
i
sail
to
sea
an
exile
with
my
comrades
and
son
and
the
gods
of
household
and
state
land
of
vast
plains
lies
apart
the
home
of
mavors
in
thracian
tillage
and
sometime
under
warrior
lycurgus
reign
friendly
of
old
to
troy
and
their
gods
in
alliance
while
our
fortune
lasted
hither
i
pass
and
on
the
winding
shore
i
lay
under
thwarting
fates
the
first
foundations
of
a
city
and
from
my
own
name
fashion
its
name
aeneadae
was
paying
sacrifice
to
my
mother
daughter
of
dione
and
to
all
the
gods
so
to
favour
the
work
begun
and
slew
a
shining
bull
on
the
shore
to
the
high
lord
of
the
heavenly
people
haply
there
lay
a
mound
hard
at
hand
crowned
with
cornel
thickets
and
bristling
dense
with
shafts
of
myrtle
i
drew
near
and
essaying
to
tear
up
the
green
wood
from
the
soil
that
i
might
cover
the
altar
with
leafy
boughs
i
see
a
portent
ominous
and
wonderful
to
tell
for
from
the
first
tree
whose
roots
are
rent
away
and
broken
from
the
ground
drops
of
black
blood
trickle
and
gore
stains
the
earth
an
icy
shudder
shakes
my
limbs
and
my
blood
curdles
chill
with
terror
yet
from
another
i
go
on
again
to
tear
away
a
tough
shoot
fully
to
fathom
its
secret
yet
from
another
black
blood
follows
out
of
the
bark
with
many
searchings
of
heart
i
prayed
the
woodland
nymphs
and
lord
gradivus
who
rules
in
the
getic
fields
to
make
the
sight
propitious
as
was
meet
and
lighten
the
omen
but
when
i
assail
a
third
spearshaft
with
a
stronger
effort
pulling
with
knees
pressed
against
the
sand
shall
i
speak
or
be
silent
from
beneath
the
mound
is
heard
a
pitiable
moan
and
a
voice
is
uttered
to
my
ears
woe
me
why
rendest
thou
me
aeneas
spare
me
at
last
in
the
tomb
spare
pollution
to
thine
innocent
hands
troy
bore
me
not
alien
to
thee
am
i
nor
this
blood
that
oozes
from
the
stem
ah
fly
the
cruel
land
fly
the
greedy
shore
for
i
am
polydorus
here
the
iron
harvest
of
weapons
hath
covered
my
pierced
body
and
shot
up
in
sharp
javelins
then
indeed
borne
down
with
dubious
terror
i
was
motionless
my
hair
stood
up
and
the
accents
faltered
on
my
tongue
polydorus
once
with
great
weight
of
gold
had
hapless
priam
sent
in
secret
to
the
nurture
of
the
thracian
king
when
now
he
was
losing
trust
in
the
arms
of
dardania
and
saw
his
city
leaguered
round
about
the
king
when
the
teucrian
power
was
broken
and
fortune
withdrew
following
agamemnon
estate
and
triumphant
arms
severs
every
bond
of
duty
murders
polydorus
and
lays
strong
hands
on
the
gold
o
accursed
hunger
of
gold
to
what
dost
thou
not
compel
human
hearts
when
the
terror
left
my
senses
i
lay
the
divine
tokens
before
the
chosen
princes
of
the
people
with
my
father
at
their
head
and
demand
their
judgment
all
are
of
one
mind
to
leave
the
guilty
land
and
abandoning
a
polluted
home
to
let
the
gales
waft
our
fleets
so
we
bury
polydorus
anew
and
the
earth
is
heaped
high
over
his
mound
altars
are
reared
to
his
ghost
sad
with
dusky
chaplets
and
black
cypress
and
around
are
the
ilian
women
with
hair
unbound
in
their
fashion
we
offer
bubbling
bowls
of
warm
milk
and
cups
of
consecrated
blood
and
lay
the
spirit
to
rest
in
her
tomb
and
with
loud
voice
utter
the
last
call
so
soon
as
ocean
may
be
trusted
and
the
winds
leave
the
seas
in
quiet
and
the
soft
whispering
south
wind
calls
seaward
my
comrades
launch
their
ships
and
crowd
the
shores
we
put
out
from
harbour
and
lands
and
towns
sink
away
there
lies
in
mid
sea
a
holy
land
most
dear
to
the
mother
of
the
nereids
and
neptune
of
aegae
which
strayed
about
coast
and
strand
till
the
archer
god
in
his
affection
chained
it
fast
from
high
myconos
and
gyaros
and
made
it
lie
immoveable
and
slight
the
winds
hither
i
steer
and
it
welcomes
my
weary
crew
to
the
quiet
shelter
of
a
safe
haven
we
disembark
and
worship

the

king
at

to

suddenly
all
seemed
to
shake
all
the
courts
and
laurels
of
the
god
the
whole
hill
to
be
stirred
round
about
and
the
cauldron
to
moan
in

we
sink
low
on
the
ground
and
a
voice
is
borne
to
our
ears
stubborn

of
dardanus
the

land
that
bore
you
by
parentage
of
old
shall
receive

thus
phoebus
and
mingled
outcries
of
great
gladness
uprose
all
ask
what
is
that
city
whither
calls
phoebus
our
wandering
and
bids
us
return
then
my

unrolling
the

of

says
he
and
learn
your
hopes
in
mid

lies
crete
the
island
of
high
jove
wherein
is
mount
ida
the
cradle
of
our
race
an
hundred
great
towns
are
inhabited
in
that
opulent
realm
from
it
our
forefather
teucer
of
old
if
i
recall
the
tale
aright
sailed
to
the
rhoetean
coasts
and
chose
a
place
for
his
kingdom
not
yet
was
ilium
nor
the
towers
of
pergama
reared
they
dwelt
in
the
valley
bottoms
hence
came
our
lady
haunter
of
cybele
the
corybantic
cymbals
and
the
grove
of
ida
hence
the
rites
of
inviolate
secrecy
and
the
lions
yoked
under
the
chariot
of
their
mistress
up
then
and
let
us
follow
where
divine
commandments
lead
let
us
appease
the
winds
and
seek
the
realm
of
gnosus
nor
is
it
a
far
journey
away
only
be
jupiter
favourable
the
third
day
shall
bring
our
fleet
to
anchor
on
the
cretan
coast
so
spoke
he
and
slew
fit
sacrifice
on
the
altars
a
bull
to
neptune
a
bull
to
thee
fair
apollo
a
black
sheep
to
tempest
a
white
to
the
prosperous
west
winds
flies
that
idomeneus
the
captain
is
driven
forth
of
his
father
realm
and
the
shores
of
crete
are
abandoned
that
the
houses
are
void
of
foes
and
the
dwellings
lie
empty
to
our
hand
we
leave
the
harbour
of
ortygia
and
fly
along
the
main
by
the
ridges
of
naxos
by
green
donusa
olearos
and
paros
and
the
cyclades
threading
the
racing
channels
among
the
crowded
lands
the
seamen
clamour
rises
in
emulous
dissonance
each
cheers
his
comrade
we
crete
and
our
a
wind
rising
astern
follows
us
forth
on
our
way
and
we
glide
at
last
to
the
ancient
curetean
coast
so
i
set
eagerly
to
work
on
the
walls
of
my
chosen
town
and
call
it
pergamea
and
exhort
my
people
joyful
at
the
name
to
cherish
their
homes
and
rear
the
castle
buildings
and
even
now
the
ships
were
drawn
up
on
the
dry
beach
the
people
were
busy
in
marriages
and
among
their
new
fields
i
was
giving
statutes
and
homesteads
when
suddenly
from
a
tainted
space
of
sky
came
noisome
on
men
bodies
and
pitiable
on
trees
and
crops
pestilence
and
a
year
of
death
they
left
their
sweet
lives
or
dragged
themselves
on
in
misery
sirius
scorched
the
fields
into
barrenness
the
herbage
grew
dry
and
the
sickly
harvest
denied
sustenance
my
father
counsels
to
remeasure
the
sea
and
go
again
to
phoebus
in
his
ortygian
oracle
to
pray
for
grace
and
ask
what
issue
he
ordains
to
our
exhausted
state
whence
he
bids
us
search
for
aid
to
our
woes
whither
bend
our
course
fell
and
sleep
held
all
things
living
on
the
earth
the
sacred
images
of
the
gods
and
the
household
deities
of
phrygia
that
i
had
borne
with
me
from
troy
out
of
the
midst
of
the
burning
city
seemed
to
stand
before
mine
eyes
as
i
lay
sleepless
clear
in
the
broad
light
where
the
full
moon
poured
through
the
latticed
windows
then
thus
addressed
me
and
with
this
speech
allayed
my
distresses
what
apollo
hath
to
tell
thee
when
thou
dost
reach
ortygia
he
utters
here
and
sends
us
unsought
to
thy
threshold
we
who
followed
thee
and
thine
arms
when
dardania
went
down
in
fire
we
who
under
thee
have
traversed
on
shipboard
the
swelling
sea
we
in
like
wise
will
exalt
to
heaven
thy
children
to
be
and
give
empire
to
their
city
do
thou
prepare
a
mighty
town
for
a
mighty
people
nor
draw
back
from
the
long
wearisome
chase
thou
must
change
thy
dwelling
not
to
these
shores
did
the
god
at
delos
counsel
thee
or
apollo
bid
thee
find
rest
in
crete
there
is
a
region
greeks
name
hesperia
an
ancient
land
mighty
in
arms
and
foison
of
the
clod
oenotrian
men
dwell
therein
now
rumour
is
that
a
younger
race
have
called
it
italy
after
their
captain
name
this
is
our
true
dwelling
place
hence
is
dardanus
sprung
and
lord
iasius
the
first
source
of
our
race
up
arise
and
tell
with
good
cheer
to
thine
aged
parent
this
plain
tale
to
seek
corythus
and
the
lands
of
ausonia
jupiter
denies
thee
the
dictaean
fields
at
this
vision
and
divine
utterance
nor
was
that
slumber
but
openly
i
seemed
to
know
their
countenances
their
veiled
hair
and
gracious
faces
and
therewith
a
cold
sweat
broke
out
all
over
me
i
spring
from
my
bed
and
raise
my
voice
and
upturned
hands
skyward
and
pay
pure
offering
on
the
hearth
the
sacrifice
done
i
joyfully
tell
anchises
and
relate
all
in
order
he
recognises
the
double
descent
and
twofold
parentage
and
the
later
wanderings
that
had
deceived
him
among
ancient
lands
then
he
speaks
o
son
hard
wrought
by
the
destinies
of
ilium
cassandra
only
foretold
me
this
fortune
now
i
recall
how
she
prophesied
this
was
fated
to
our
race
and
often
cried
of
hesperia
often
of
an
italian
realm
but
who
was
to
believe
that
teucrians
should
come
to
hesperian
shores
or
whom
might
cassandra
then
move
by
prophecy
yield
we
to
phoebus
and
follow
the
better
way
he
counsels
so
says
he
and
we
all
rejoicingly
obey
his
speech
this
dwelling
likewise
we
abandon
and
leaving
some
few
behind
spread
our
sails
and
run
over
the
waste
sea
in
our
hollow
wood
our
ships
held
the
high
seas
nor
any
land
yet
appears
the
sky
all
round
us
and
all
round
us
the
deep
a
dusky
shower
drew
up
overhead
carrying
night
and
tempest
and
the
wave
shuddered
and
gloomed
straightway
the
winds
upturn
the
main
and
great
seas
rise
we
are
tossed
asunder
over
the
dreary
gulf
stormclouds
enwrap
the
day
and
rainy
gloom
blots
out
the
sky
out
of
the
clouds
bursts
fire
fast
upon
fire
driven
from
our
course
we
go
wandering
on
the
blind
waves
palinurus
himself
professes
he
can
not
tell
day
from
night
on
the
sky
nor
remember
the
way
amid
the
waters
three
dubious
days
of
blind
darkness
we
wander
on
the
deep
as
many
nights
without
a
star
not
till
the
fourth
day
was
land
at
last
seen
to
rise
discovering
distant
hills
and
sending
up
wreaths
of
smoke
the
sails
drop
we
swing
back
to
the
oars
without
delay
the
sailors
strongly
toss
up
the
foam
and
sweep
through
the
green
water
the
shores
of
the
strophades
first
receive
me
thus
won
from
the
waves
strophades
the
greek
name
they
bear
islands
lying
in
the
great
ionian
sea
which
boding
celaeno
and
the
other
harpies
inhabit
since
phineus
house
was
shut
on
them
and
they
fled
in
terror
from
the
board
of
old
than
these
no
deadlier
portent
nor
any
fiercer
plague
of
divine
wrath
hath
issued
from
the
stygian
waters
winged
things
with
maidens
countenance
bellies
dropping
filth
and
clawed
hands
and
faces
ever
wan
with
hunger
borne
hitherward
we
enter
the
haven
lo
we
see
goodly
herds
of
oxen
scattered
on
the
plains
and
goats
flocking
untended
over
the
grass
we
attack
them
with
the
sword
and
call
the
gods
and
jove
himself
to
share
our
spoil
then
we
build
seats
on
the
winding
shore
and
banquet
on
the
dainty
food
but
suddenly
the
harpies
are
upon
us
swooping
awfully
from
the
mountains
and
shaking
their
wings
with
loud
clangour
plunder
the
feast
and
defile
everything
with
unclean
touch
spreading
a
foul
smell
and
uttering
dreadful
cries
again
in
a
deep
recess
under
a
caverned
rock
shut
in
with
waving
shadows
of
woodland
we
array
the
board
and
renew
the
altar
fires
again
from
their
blind
ambush
in
diverse
quarters
of
the
sky
the
noisy
crowd
flutter
with
clawed
feet
around
their
prey
defiling
the
feast
with
their
lips
then
i
bid
my
comrades
take
up
arms
and
proclaim
war
on
the
accursed
race
even
as
i
bade
they
do
range
their
swords
in
cover
among
the
grass
and
hide
their
shields
out
of
sight
so
when
they
swooped
clamorously
down
along
the
winding
shore
misenus
from
his
on
high
signals
on
the
hollow
brass
my
comrades
rush
in
and
essay
the
strange
battle
to
set
the
stain
of
steel
on
the
winged
horrors
of
the
sea
but
they
take
no
violence
on
their
plumage
nor
wounds
on
their
bodies
and
soaring
into
the
firmament
with
rapid
flight
leave
their
foul
traces
on
the
spoil
they
had
half
consumed
celaeno
alone
prophetess
of
ill
alights
on
a
towering
cliff
and
thus
breaks
forth
in
deep
accents
war
is
it
for
your
slaughtered
oxen
and
steers
cut
down
o
children
of
laomedon
war
is
it
you
would
declare
and
drive
the
guiltless
harpies
from
their
ancestral
kingdom
take
then
to
heart
and
fix
fast
these
words
of
mine
which
the
lord
omnipotent
foretold
to
phoebus
phoebus
apollo
to
me
i
eldest
born
of
the
furies
reveal
to
you
italy
is
your
goal
wooing
the
winds
you
shall
go
to
italy
and
enter
her
harbours
unhindered
yet
shall
you
not
wall
round
your
ordained
city
ere
this
murderous
outrage
on
us
compel
you
in
portentous
hunger
to
eat
your
tables
with
gnawing
teeth
spoke
and
winged
her
way
back
to
the
shelter
of
the
wood
but
my
comrades
blood
froze
chill
with
sudden
affright
their
spirits
fell
and
no
longer
with
arms
nay
with
vows
and
prayers
they
bid
me
entreat
favour
whether
these
be
goddesses
or
winged
things
and
foul
and
lord
anchises
from
the
beach
calls
with
outspread
hands
on
the
mighty
gods
ordering
fit
sacrifices
gods
avert
their
menaces
gods
turn
this
woe
away
and
graciously
save
the
righteous
then
he
bids
pluck
the
cable
from
the
shore
and
shake
loose
the
sheets
southern
winds
stretch
the
sails
we
scud
over
the
waters
whither

called
our
course
now

zacynthos
appears
amid

the

at

in

leave

and
sit
down
at

emulously
my

through

we
see
the

of

and
enter
the
chaonian
haven
and
approach
high
buthrotum
town
the
rumour
of
a
story
beyond
belief
comes
on
our
ears
helenus
son
of
priam
is
reigning
over
greek
towns
master
of
the
bride
and
sceptre
of
pyrrhus
the
aeacid
and
andromache
hath
again
fallen
to
a
husband
of
her
people
i
stood
amazed
and
my
heart
kindled
with
marvellous
desire
to
accost
him
and
learn
of
so
strange
a
fortune
i
advance
from
the
harbour
leaving
the
fleet
ashore
just
when
haply
andromache
in
a
grove
before
the
town
by
the
waters
of
a
feigned
simoïs
was
pouring
libation
to
the
dust
and
calling
hector
ghost
to
a
tomb
with
his
name
on
an
empty
turfed
green
with
two
altars
that
she
had
consecrated
a
wellspring
of
tears
when
she
caught
sight
of
me
coming
and
saw
distractedly
the
encircling
arms
of
troy
at
the
vision
marvellously
shewn
her
gaze
fixed
and
the
heat
left
her
frame
she
swoons
away
and
hardly
at
last
speaks
after
long
interval
comest
thou
then
a
real
face
a
real
messenger
to
me
livest
thou
or
if
sweet
light
is
fled
ah
where
is
hector
she
spoke
and
bursting
into
tears
filled
all
the
place
with
her
crying
just
a
few
words
i
force
up
and
deeply
moved
gasp
out
in
broken
accents
i
live
indeed
i
live
on
through
all
extremities
doubt
not
for
real
are
the
forms
thou
seest
alas
after
such
an
husband
what
fate
receives
thy
fall
or
what
worthier
fortune
revisits
thee
dost
thou
hector
andromache
keep
bonds
of
marriage
with
pyrrhus
she
cast
down
her
countenance
and
spoke
with
lowered
voice
o
single
in
happy
eminence
that
maiden
daughter
of
priam
sentenced
to
die
under
high
troy
town
at
an
enemy
grave
who
never
bore
the
shame
of
the
lot
nor
came
a
captive
to
her
victorious
master
bed
we
sailing
over
alien
seas
from
our
burning
land
have
endured
the
haughty
youthful
pride
of
achilles
seed
and
borne
children
in
slavery
he
thereafter
wooing
leda
hermione
and
a
lacedaemonian
marriage
passed
me
over
to
helenus
keeping
a
bondwoman
to
a
bondman
but
him
orestes
aflame
with
passionate
desire
for
his
stolen
bride
and
driven
by
the
furies
of
crime
catches
unguarded
and
murders
at
his
ancestral
altars
at
neoptolemus
death
a
share
of
his
realm
fell
to
helenus
hands
who
named
the
plains
chaonian
and
called
all
the
land
chaonia
after
chaon
of
troy
and
built
withal
a
pergama
and
this
ilian
citadel
on
the
hills
but
to
thee
how
did
winds
how
fates
give
passage
or
whose
divinity
landed
thee
all
unwitting
on
our
coasts
what
of
the
boy
ascanius
lives
he
yet
and
draws
breath
thy
darling
whom
troy
yet
hath
the
child
affection
for
his
lost
mother
is
he
roused
to
the
valour
of
old
and
the
spirit
of
manhood
by
his
father
aeneas
by
his
uncle
hector
words
she
poured
forth
weeping
and
prolonged
the
vain
wail
when
the
hero
helenus
son
of
priam
approaches
from
the
town
with
a
great
company
knows
us
for
his
kin
and
leads
us
joyfully
to
his
gates
shedding
a
many
tears
at
every
word
i
advance
and
recognise
a
little
troy
and
a
copy
of
the
great
pergama
and
a
dry
brook
with
the
name
of
xanthus
and
clasp
a
scaean
gateway
therewithal
my
teucrians
make
holiday
in
the
friendly
town
the
king
entertained
them
in
his
spacious
colonnades
in
the
central
hall
they
poured
goblets
of
wine
in
libation
and
held
the
cups
while
the
feast
was
served
on
gold
now
a
day
and
another
day
hath
sped
the
breezes
woo
our
sails
and
the
canvas
blows
out
to
the
swelling
south
with
these
words
i
accost
the
prophet
and
thus
make
request
son
of
troy
interpreter
of
the
gods
whose
sense
is
open
to
influences
his
tripods
and
laurels
to
stars
and
tongues
of
birds
and
auguries
of
prosperous
flight
tell
me
now
for
the
voice
of
revelation
was
all
favourable
to
my
course
and
all
divine
influence
counselled
me
to
seek
italy
and
explore
remote
lands
only
celaeno
the
harpy
prophesies
of
strange
portents
a
horror
to
tell
and
cries
out
of
wrath
and
bale
and
foul
hunger
what
perils
are
the
first
to
shun
or
in
what
guidance
may
i
overcome
these
sore
labours
helenus
first
suing
for
divine
favour
with
fit
sacrifice
of
steers
and
unbinding
from
his
head
the
chaplets
of
consecration
leads
me
in
his
hand
to
thy
courts
o
phoebus
thrilled
with
the
fulness
of
the
deity
and
then
utters
these
prophetic
words
from
his
augural
lips
since
there
is
clear
assurance
that
under
high
omens
thou
dost
voyage
through
the
deep
so
the
king
of
the
gods
allots
destiny
and
unfolds
change
this
is
the
circle
of
ordinance
a
few
things
out
of
many
i
will
unfold
to
thee
in
speech
that
so
thou
mayest
more
safely
traverse
the
seas
of
thy
sojourn
and
find
rest
in
the
ausonian
haven
for
helenus
is
forbidden
by
the
destinies
to
know
and
by
juno
daughter
of
saturn
to
utter
more
first
of
all
the
italy
thou
deemest
now
nigh
and
close
at
hand
unwitting
the
harbours
thou
wouldst
enter
far
are
they
sundered
by
a
long
and
trackless
track
through
length
of
lands
first
must
the
trinacrian
wave
clog
thine
oar
and
thy
ships
traverse
the
salt
ausonian
plain
by
the
infernal
pools
and
aeaean
circe
isle
ere
thou
mayest
build
thy
city
in
safety
on
a
peaceful
land
i
will
tell
thee
the
token
and
do
thou
keep
it
close
in
thine
heart
when
in
thy
perplexity
beside
the
wave
of
a
sequestered
river
a
great
sow
shall
be
discovered
lying
under
the
oaks
on
the
brink
with
her
newborn
litter
of
thirty
couched
white
on
the
ground
her
white
brood
about
her
teats
that
shall
be
the
place
of
the
city
that
the
appointed
rest
from
thy
toils
neither
shrink
thou
at
the
gnawn
tables
that
await
thee
the
fates
will
find
a
way
and
apollo
aid
thy
call
these
lands
moreover
on
this
nearest
border
of
the
italian
shore
that
our
own
sea
tide
washes

thou
evil
greeks
dwell
in
all
their
towns
here
the
locrians
of
narycos
have
set
their
city
and
here
lyctian
idomeneus
beset
the
sallentine
plains
with
soldiery
here
is
the
town
of
the
meliboean
captain
philoctetes
little
petelia
fenced
by
her
wall
nay
when
thy
fleets
have
crossed
overseas
and
lie
at
anchor
when
now
thou
rearest
altars
and
payest
vows
on
the
beach
veil
thine
hair
with
a
purple
garment
for
covering
that
no
hostile
face
at
thy
divine
worship
may
meet
thee
amid
the
holy
fires
and
make
void
the
omens
this
fashion
of
sacrifice
keep
thou
thyself
and
thy
comrades
and
let
thy
children
abide
in
this
pure
observance
but
when
at
thy
departure
the
wind
hath
borne
thee
to
the
sicilian
coast
and
the
barred
straits
of
pelorus
open
out

for
the
country
and
the
long
circuit
of
the
seas
on
the
left
hand
shun
the
shore
and
water
on
thy
right
these
lands
they
say
of
old
broke
asunder
torn
and
upheaved
by
vast
force
when
either
country
was
one
and
undivided
the
ocean
burst
in
between
cutting
off
with
its
waves
the
hesperian
from
the
sicilian
coast
and
with
narrow
tide
washes
tilth
and
town
along
the
severance
of
shore
on
the
right
scylla
keeps
guard
on
the
left
unassuaged
charybdis
who
thrice
swallows
the
vast
flood
sheer
down
her
swirling
gulf
and
ever
again
hurls
it
upward
lashing
the
sky
with
water
but
scylla
lies
prisoned
in
her
cavern
blind
recesses
thrusting
forth
her
mouth
and
drawing
ships
upon
the
rocks
in
front
her
face
is
human
and
her
breast
fair
as
a
maiden
to
the
waist
down
behind
she
is
a
of
monstrous
frame
with
dolphins
tails
joined
on
her
belly
better
to
track
the
goal
of
trinacrian
pachynus
lingering
and
wheeling
round
through
long
spaces
than
once
catch
sight
of
misshapen
scylla
deep
in
her
dreary
cavern
and
of
the
rocks
that
ring
to
her
hounds
moreover
if
helenus
hath
aught
of
foresight
or
his
prophecy
of
assurance
if
apollo
fills
his
spirit
with
the
truth
this
one
thing
one
thing
for
all
will
i
foretell
thee
and
again
and
again
repeat
my
counsel
to
great
juno
deity
be
thy
first
prayer
and
worship
to
juno
utter
thy
willing
vows
and
overcome
thy
mighty
mistress
with
gifts
and
supplications
so
at
last
thou
shalt
leave
trinacria
behind
and
be
sped
in
triumph
to
the
italian
borders
when
borne
hither
thou
drawest
nigh
the
cymaean
city
the
haunted
lakes
and
rustling
woods
of
avernus
thou
shalt
behold
the
raving
prophetess
who
deep
in
the
rock
chants
of
fate
and
marks
down
her
words
on
leaves
what
verses
she
writes
down
on
them
the
maiden
sorts
into
order
and
shuts
behind
her
in
the
cave
they
stay
in
their
places
unstirred
and
quit
not
their
rank
but
when
at
the
turn
of
the
hinge
the
light
wind
from
the
doorway
stirs
them
and
disarranges
the
delicate
foliage
never
after
does
she
trouble
to
capture
them
as
they
flutter
about
the
hollow
rock
nor
restore
their
places
or
join
the
verses
men
depart
without
counsel
and
hate
the
sibyl
dwelling
here
let
no
waste
in
delay
be
of
such
account
to
thee
though
thy
company
chide
and
the
passage
call
thy
sails
strongly
to
the
deep
and
thou
mayest
fill
out
their
folds
to
thy
desire
that
thou
do
not
approach
the
prophetess
and
plead
with
prayers
that
she
herself
utter
her
oracles
and
deign
to
loose
the
accents
from
her
lips
the
nations
of
italy
and
the
wars
to
come
and
the
fashion
whereby
every
toil
may
be
avoided
or
endured
she
shall
unfold
to
thee
and
grant
her
worshipper
prosperous
passage
thus
far
is
our
voice
allowed
to
counsel
thee
go
thy
way
and
exalt
troy
to
heaven
by
thy
deeds
the
seer
uttered
with
friendly
lips
then
orders
gifts
to
be
carried
to
my

a

and
a

your

have
built
with
better
omens
i
pray
and
to
be
less
open
to
the
greeks
if
ever
i
enter
tiber
and
tiber
bordering
fields
and
see
a
city
granted
to
my
nation
then
of
these
kindred
towns
and
allied
peoples
in
epirus
and
hesperia
which
have
the
same
dardanus
for
founder
and
whose

is
one
of
both

our
hearts
make
a
single
troy
let
that
charge
await
our
posterity
put
out
to
sea
keeping
the
ceraunian
mountains
close
at
hand
whence
is
the
shortest
passage
and
seaway
to
italy
the
sun
sets
meanwhile
and
the
dusky
hills
grow
dim
we
choose
a
place
and
fling
ourselves
on
the
lap
of
earth
at
the
water
edge
and
allotting
the
oars
spread
ourselves
on
the
dry
beach
for
refreshment
the
dew
of
slumber
falls
on
our
weary
limbs
not
yet
had
night
driven
of
the
hours
climbed
her
mid
arch
palinurus

lightly
from
his
couch
explores
all
the

and
listens
to
catch

he
marks
the
constellations
gliding
together
through
the
silent
sky
arcturus
the
rainy
hyades
and
the
twin
oxen
and
scans
orion
in
his
armour
of
gold
when
he
sees
the
clear
sky
quite
unbroken
he
gives
from
the
stern
his
shrill
signal
we
disencamp
and
explore
the
way
and
spread
the
wings
of
our
sails
and
now
reddening
dawn
had
chased
away
the
stars
when
we
descry
afar
dim
hills
and
the
low
line
of
italy
achates
first
raises
the
cry
of
and
with
joyous
shouts
my
comrades
salute
italy
then
lord
anchises
enwreathed
a
great
bowl
and
filled
it
up
with
wine
and
called
on
the
gods
standing
high
astern
gods
sovereign
over
sea
and
land
and
weather
bring
wind
to
ease
our
way
and
breathe
favourably
the
breezes
freshen
at
his
prayer
and
now
the
harbour
opens
out
nearer
at
hand
and
a
temple
appears
on
the
fort
of
minerva
my
comrades
furl
the
sails
and
swing
the
prows
to
shore
the
harbour
is
scooped
into
an
arch
by
the
eastern
flood

run
out
and
foam
with
the
salt
spray
itself
it
lies
concealed

let
down
their

on
either

and
the
temple
retreats
from
the
beach
here
an
inaugural
sight
four
horses
of
snowy
whiteness
are
grazing
abroad
on
the
grassy
plain
and
lord
anchises
war
dost
thou
carry
land
of
our
sojourn
horses
are
armed
in
war
and
menace
of
war
is
in
this
herd
but
yet
these
same
beasts
are
wont
in
time
to
enter
harness
and
carry
yoke
and
bit
in
concord
there
is
hope
of
peace
too
says
he
then
we
pray
to
the
holy
deity

clangorous
arms

first
to
welcome
our
cheers
and
before
the
altars
we
veil
our
heads
in
phrygian
garments
and
duly
after
the
counsel
helenus
had
urged
deepest
on
us
pay
the
bidden
to
juno
of
argos
delay
once
our
vows
are
fully
paid
we
round
to
the
arms
of
our
sailyards
and
leave
the
dwellings
and
menacing
fields
of
the
grecian
people
next
is
descried
the
bay
of
tarentum
town
if
rumour
is
true
of
hercules
over
against
it
the
goddess
of
lacinium
rears
her
head
with
the
towers
of
caulon
and
scylaceum
wrecker
of
ships
then
trinacrian
aetna
is
descried
in
the
distance
rising
from
the
waves
and
we
hear
from
afar
a
great
roaring
of
the
sea
on
beaten
rocks
and
broken
noises
by
the
shore
the
channels
boil
up
and
the
surge
churns
with
sand
and
lord
anchises
of
a
surety
this
is
that
charybdis
of
these
cliffs
these
awful
rocks
did
helenus
prophesy
out
o
comrades
and
rise
together
to
the
oars
even
as
bidden
they
do
and
first
palinurus
swung
the
gurgling
prow
leftward
through
the
water
to
the
left
all
our
squadron
bent
with
oar
and
wind
we
are
lifted
skyward
on
the
crescent
wave
and
again
sunk
deep
into
the
nether
world
as
the
water
is
sucked
away
thrice
amid
their
rocky
caverns
the
cliffs
uttered
a
cry
thrice
we
see
the
foam
flung
out
and
the
stars
through
a
dripping
veil
meanwhile
the
wind
falls
with
sundown
and
weary
and
ignorant
of
the
way
we
glide
on
to
the
cyclopes
coast
lies
a
harbour
large
and
unstirred
by
the
entrance
but
nigh
it
aetna
thunders
awfully
in
wrack
and
ever
and
again
hurls
a
black
cloud
into
the
sky
smoking
with
boiling
pitch
and
embers
white
hot
and
heaves
balls
of
flame
flickering
up
to
the
stars
ever
and
again
vomits
out
on
high
crags
from
the
torn
entrails
of
the
mountain
tosses
up
masses
of
molten
rock
with
a
groan
and
boils
forth
from
the
bottom
rumour
is
that
this
mass
weighs
down
the
body
of
enceladus
by
the
thunderbolt
and
mighty
aetna
laid
over
him
suspires
the
flame
that
bursts
from
her
furnaces
and
so
often
as
he
changes
his
weary
side
all
trinacria
shudders
and
moans
veiling
the
sky
in
smoke
that
night
we
spend
in
cover
of
the
forest
among
portentous
horrors
and
see
not
from
what
source
the
noise
comes
for
neither
did
the
stars
show
their
fires
nor
was
the
vault
of
constellated
sky
clear
but
vapours
blotted
heaven
and
the
moon
was
held
in
a
through
dead
of
night
now
the
morrow
was
rising
in
the
early
east
and
the
dewy
darkness
rolled
away
from
the
sky
by
dawn
when
sudden
out
of
the
forest
advances
a
human
shape
strange
and
unknown
worn
with
uttermost
hunger
and
pitiably
attired
and
stretches
entreating
hands
towards
the
shore
we
look
back
filthy
and
wretched
with
shaggy
beard
and
a
coat
pinned
together
with
thorns
he
was
yet
a
greek
and
had
been
sent
of
old
to
troy
in
his
father
arms
and
he
when
he
saw
afar
the
dardanian
habits
and
armour
of
troy
hung
back
a
little
in
terror
at
the
sight
and
stayed
his
steps
then
ran
headlong
to
the
shore
with
weeping
and
prayers
by
the
heavens
i
beseech
you
by
the
heavenly
powers
and
this
luminous
sky
that
gives
us
breath
take
me
up
o
trojans
carry
me
away
to
any
land
soever
and
it
will
be
enough
i
know
i
am
one
out
of
the
grecian
fleets
i
confess
i
warred
against
the
household
gods
of
ilium
for
that
if
our
wrong
and
guilt
is
so
great
throw
me
piecemeal
on
the
flood
or
plunge
me
in
the
waste
sea
if
i
do
perish
gladly
will
i
perish
at
human
hands
he
ended
and
clung
clasping
our
knees
and
grovelling
at
them
we
encourage
him
to
tell
who
he
is
and
of
what
blood
born
and
reveal
how
fortune
pursues
him
since
then
lord
anchises
after
little
delay
gives
him
his
hand
and
strengthens
his
courage
by
visible
pledge
at
last
laying
aside
his
terror
he
speaks
thus
i
am
from
an
ithacan
home
achemenides
by
name
set
out
for
troy
in
luckless
ulysses
company
poor
was
my
father
adamastus
and
would
god
fortune
had
stayed
thus
here
my
comrades
abandoned
me
in
the
vast
cave
mindless
of
me
while
they
hurry
away
from
the
barbarous
gates
it
is
a
house
of
gore
and
feasts
dim
and
huge
within
himself
he
is
great
of
stature
and
knocks
at
the
lofty
sky
gods
take
away
a
curse
like
this
from
earth
to
none
gracious
in
aspect
or
courteous
of
speech
he
feeds
on
the
flesh
and
dark
blood
of
wretched
men
i
myself
saw
when
he
caught
the
bodies
of
two
of
us
with
his
great
hand
and
lying
back
in
the
middle
of
the
cave
crushed
them
on
the
rock
and
the
courts
splashed
and
swam
with
gore
i
saw
when
he
champed
the
flesh
adrip
with
dark
clots
of
blood
and
the
warm
limbs
quivered
under
his
teeth
yet
not
unavenged
ulysses
brooked
not
this
nor
even
in
such
straits
did
the
ithacan
forget
himself
for
so
soon
as
he
gorged
with
his
feast
and
buried
in
wine
lay
with
bent
neck
sprawling
huge
over
the
cave
in
his
sleep
vomiting
gore
and
gobbets
mixed
with
wine
and
blood
we
praying
to
the
great
gods
and
with
parts
allotted
pour
at
once
all
round
him
and
pierce
with
a
sharp
weapon
the
huge
eye
that
lay
sunk
single
under
his
savage
brow
in
fashion
of
an
argolic
shield
or
the
lamp
of
the
moon
and
at
last
we
exultingly
avenge
the
ghosts
of
our
comrades
but
fly
o
wretched
men
fly
and
pluck
the
cable
from
the
beach
for
even
in
the
shape
and
stature
of
polyphemus
when
he
shuts
his
fleeced
flocks
and
drains
their
udders
in
the
cave
covert
an
hundred
other
horrible
cyclopes
dwell
all
about
this
shore
and
stray
on
the
mountain
heights
thrice
now
does
the
horned
moon
fill
out
her
light
while
i
linger
in
life
among
desolate
lairs
and
haunts
of
wild
beasts
in
the
woodland
and
from
a
rock
survey
the
giant
cyclopes
and
shudder
at
their
cries
and
echoing
feet
the
boughs
yield
a
miserable
sustenance
berries
and
stony
sloes
and
plants
torn
up
by
the
root
feed
me
sweeping
all
the
view
i
at
last
espied
this
fleet
standing
in
to
shore
on
it
whatsoever
it
were
i
cast
myself
it
is
enough
to
have
escaped
the
accursed
tribe
do
you
rather
by
any
death
you
will
destroy
this
life
of
mine
had
he
spoken
thus
when
on
the
mountain
top
we
see
shepherding
his
flocks
a
vast
moving
mass
polyphemus
himself
seeking
the
shores
he
knew
a
horror
ominous
shapeless
huge
bereft
of
sight
a
pine
lopped
by
his
hand
guides
and
steadies
his
footsteps
his
fleeced
sheep
attend
him
this
his
single
delight
and
solace
in
after
he
hath
touched
the
deep
flood
and
come
to
the
sea
he
washes
in
it
the
blood
that
oozes
from
his
grinding
his
teeth
with
groans
and
now
he
strides
through
the
sea
up
to
his
middle
nor
yet
does
the
wave
wet
his
towering
sides
we
hurry
far
away
in
precipitate
flight
with
the
suppliant
who
had
so
well
merited
rescue
and
silently
cut
the
cable
and
bending
forward
sweep
the
sea
with
emulous
oars
he
heard
and
turned
his
steps
towards
the
echoing
sound
but
when
he
may
in
no
wise
lay
hands
on
us
nor
can
fathom
the
ionian
waves
in
pursuit
he
raises
a
vast
cry
at
which
the
sea
and
all
his
waves
shuddered
and
the
deep
land
of
italy
was
startled
and
aetna
vaulted
caverns
moaned
but
the
tribe
of
the
cyclopes
roused
from
the
high
wooded
hills
run
to
the
harbour
and
fill
the
shore
we
descry
the
aetnean
brotherhood
standing
impotent
with
scowling
eye
their
stately
heads
up
to
heaven
a
dreadful
consistory
even
as
on
a
mountain
summit
stand
oaks
high
in
air
or
coned
cypresses
a
high
forest
of
jove
or
covert
of
diana
sharp
fear
urges
us
to
shake
out
the
sheets
in
reckless
haste
and
spread
our
sails
to
the
favouring
wind
yet
helenus
commands
counsel
that
our
course
keep
not
the
way
between
scylla
and
charybdis
the
very
edge
of
death
on
either
hand
we
are
resolved
to
turn
our
canvas
back
and
lo
from
the
narrow
fastness
of
pelorus
the
north
wind
comes
down
and
reaches
us
i
sail
past
pantagias
mouth
with
its
living
stone
the
megarian
bay
and
thapsus
such
names
did
achemenides
of
luckless
company
point
out
as
he
retraced
his
wanderings
along
the
returning
shores
in

of
a
bay
of
sicily
lies
an
islet

ortygia
hither
alpheus
the

runs
hath
cloven
a
secret
passage
beneath
the
sea
and
now
through
thy
arethusa
mingles
with
the
sicilian
waves
we
adore
as
bidden
the
great
deities
of
the
ground
and
thence
i
cross
the
fertile
soil
of
helorus
in
the
marsh
next
we
graze
the
high
reefs
and
jutting
rocks
of
pachynus
and
far
off
appears
camarina
forbidden
for
ever
by
oracles
to
move
and
the
geloan
plains
and
vast
gela
named
after
its
river
then
acragas
on
the

the

of

displays
its
massive
walls
in

and
with

i
leave
thee
behind
selinus
and
thread
the
difficult
shoals
and
blind
reefs
of
lilybaeum
thereon
drepanum

me
in
its

so
many
tempestuous

outgone
alas
my

the
solace
of
every
care
and

anchises
is
lost
to
me
here
thou
dear
lord
abandonest
me
in
weariness
alas
rescued
in
vain
from
peril
and
doom
not
helenus
the
prophet
though
he
counselled
of
many
a
terror
not
boding
celaeno
foretold
me
of
this
grief
this
was
the
last
agony
this
the
goal
of
the
long
ways
thence
it
was
i
had
departed
when
god
landed
me
on
your
coasts
thus
lord
aeneas
with
all
attent
retold
alone
the
divine
doom
and
the
history
of
his
goings
at
last
he
was
hushed
and
here
in
silence
made
an
end
book
fourth
the
love
of
dido
and
her
end
but
the
queen
long
ere
now
pierced
with
sore
distress
feeds
the
wound
with
her
and
catches
the
fire
unseen
again
and
again
his
own
valiance
and
his
line
renown
flood
back
upon
her
spirit
look
and
accent
cling
fast
in
her
bosom
and
the
pain
allows
not
rest
or
calm
to
her
limbs
the
morrow
dawn
bore
the
torch
of
phoebus
across
the
earth
and
had
rolled
away
the
dewy
darkness
from
the
sky
when
scarce
herself
she
thus
opens
her
confidence
to
her
sister
my
sister
such
dreams
of
terror
thrill
me
through
what
guest
unknown
is
this
who
hath
entered
our
dwelling
how
high
his
mien
how
brave
in
heart
as
in
arms
i
believe
it
well
with
no
vain
assurance
his
blood
is
divine
fear
proves
the
vulgar
spirit
alas
by
what
destinies
is
he
driven
what
wars
outgone
he
chronicled
were
my
mind
not
planted
fixed
and
immoveable
to
ally
myself
to
none
in
wedlock
since
my
love
of
old
was
false
to
me
in
the
treachery
of
death
were
i
not
sick
to
the
heart
of
bridal
torch
and
chamber
to
this
temptation
alone
i
might
haply
yield
anna
i
will
confess
it
since
sychaeus
mine
husband
met
his
piteous
doom
and
our
household
was
shattered
by
a
brother
murder
he
only
hath
touched
mine
heart
and
stirred
the
balance
of
my
soul
i
know
the
prints
of
the
ancient
flame
but
rather
i
pray
may
earth
first
yawn
deep
for
me
or
the
lord
omnipotent
hurl
me
with
his
thunderbolt
into
gloom
the
pallid
gloom
and
profound
night
of
erebus
ere
i
soil
thee
mine
honour
or
unloose
thy
laws
he
took
my
love
away
who
made
me
one
with
him
long
ago
he
shall
keep
it
with
him
and
guard
it
in
the
tomb
she

thus

is
the

and
splendid
the
spoils
you
win
thou
and
that
boy
of
thine
and

the
renown
of

if

nor
am
i
so
blind

thy

thine

what
shall
be
the
end
or
why
all
this
contest
now
nay
rather
let
us
work
an
enduring
peace
and
a
bridal
compact
thou
hast
what
all
thy
soul
desired
dido
is
on
fire
with
love
and
hath
caught
the
madness
through
and
through
then
rule
we
this
people
jointly
in
equal
lordship
allow
her
to
be
a
phrygian
husband
slave
and
to
lay
her
tyrians
for
dowry
in
thine
hand
to
her
for
she
knew
the
dissembled
purpose
of
her
words
to
turn
the
teucrian
kingdom
away
to
the
coasts
of
libya
venus
thus
began
in

so
mad
as
to
reject
these
terms
or
choose
rather
to
try
the
fortune
of
war
with
thee
if
only
when
done
as
thou
sayest
fortune
follow
but
i
move
in
uncertainty
of
jove

whether
he
will
that
tyrians
and
wanderers
from

be
one
city
or
approve
the
mingling
of

of

thou
art

foremost
of

unites

than
whom
none

she
thrives
on

gains
strength
by

she
lifts
herself
on

and
paces
the

with

hidden
among

clouds
her
one

stung
by
wrath
against

gods
bore

swift

ominous
awful
vast
for

on

is
a
waking
eye
beneath
wonderful
to

and
as

and
straining

by

she
flits
between

shrilling
through

dusk
and
droops
not

she
sits
on

afraid
obstinate
in
perverseness
and
forgery
no

than
messenger
of

she
then
exultingly
filled
the

with

undone

enthralled
by
passionate
dishonour
this
the
pestilent
goddess
spreads
abroad
in

and
bends
her
course
right
on
to

with
her

fires
his
spirit
and
swells
his
wrath
he
the
seed
of
ammon
by
a
ravished
garamantian
nymph
had
built
to
jove
in
his
wide
realms
an
hundred
great
temples
an
hundred
altars
and
consecrated
the
wakeful
fire
that
keeps
watch
by
night
before
the
gods
perpetually
where
the
soil
is
fat
with
blood
of
beasts
and
the
courts
blossom
with
pied
garlands
and
he
distracted
and
on
fire
at
the
bitter
tidings
before
his
altars
amid
the
divine
presences
often
it
is
said
bowed
in
prayer
to

with
uplifted

omnipotent
to

from
the
broidered
cushions
of
their
banqueting
halls
the
maurusian
people
now
pour
lenaean
offering
lookest
thou
on
this
or
do
we
shudder
vainly
when
our
father
hurls
the
thunderbolt
and
do
blind
fires
in
the
clouds
and
idle
rumblings
appal
our
soul
the
woman
who
wandering
in
our
coasts
planted
a
small
town
on
purchased
ground
to
whom
we
gave
fields
by
the
shore
and
laws
of
settlement
she
hath
spurned
our
alliance
and
taken
aeneas
for
lord
of
her
realm
and
now
that
paris
with
his
effeminate
crew
his
chin
and
oozy
hair
swathed
in
the
turban
of
maeonia
takes
and
keeps
her
since
to
thy
temples
we
bear
oblation
and
hallow
an
empty
name
in
such
words
he
pleaded
clasping
the
altars
the
lord
omnipotent
heard
and
cast
his
eye
on
the
royal
city
and
the
lovers
forgetful
of
their
fairer
fame
then
he
addresses
this
charge
to
mercury
and
away
o
son
call
the
breezes
and
slide
down
them
on
thy
wings
accost
the
dardanian
captain
who
now
loiters
in
tyrian
carthage
and
casts
not
a
look
on
destined
cities
carry
down
my
words
through
the
fleet
air
not
such
an
one
did
his
mother
most
beautiful
vouch
him
to
us
nor
for
this
twice
rescue
him
from
grecian
arms
but
he
was
to
rule
an
italy
teeming
with
empire
and
loud
with
war
to
transmit
the
line
of
teucer
royal
blood
and
lay
all
the
world
beneath
his
law
if
such
glories
kindle
him
in
nowise
and
he
take
no
trouble
for
his
own
honour
does
a
father
grudge
his
ascanius
the
towers
of
rome
with
what
device
or
in
what
hope
loiters
he
among
a
hostile
race
and
casts
not
a
glance
on
his
ausonian
children
and
the
fields
of
lavinium
let
him
set
sail
this
is
the
sum
thereof
be
thou
our
messenger
he
ended
his
son
made
ready
to
obey
his
high
command
and
first
he
laces
to
his
feet
the
shoes
of
gold
that
bear
him
high
winging
over
seas
or
land
as
fleet
as
the
gale
then
takes
the
rod
wherewith
he
calls
wan
souls
forth
of
orcus
or
sends
them
again
to
the
sad
depth
of
hell
gives
sleep
and
takes
it
away
and
unseals
dead
eyes
in
whose
strength
he
courses
the
winds
and
swims
across
the
tossing
clouds
and
now
in
flight
he
descries
the
peak
and
steep
sides
of
toiling
atlas
whose
crest
sustains
the
sky
atlas
whose
head
is
girt
alway
with
black
clouds
and
beaten
by
wind
and
rain
snow
is
shed
over
his
shoulders
for
covering
rivers
tumble
over
his
aged
chin
and
his
rough
beard
is
stiff
with
ice
here
the
cyllenian
poised
evenly
on
his
wings
made
a
first
stay
hence
he
shot
himself
sheer
to
the
water
like
a
bird
that
flies
low
skirting
the
sea
about
the
craggy
shores
of
its
fishery
even
thus
the
brood
of
cyllene
left
his
mother
father
and
flew
cutting
the
winds
between
sky
and
land
along
the
sandy
libyan
shore
so
soon
as
his
winged
feet
reached
the
settlement
he
espies
aeneas
founding
towers
and
ordering
new
dwellings
his
sword
twinkled
with
yellow
jasper
and
a
cloak
hung
from
his
shoulders
ablaze
with
tyrian
a
gift
that
dido
had
made
costly
and
shot
the
warp
with
thin
gold
straightway
he
breaks
in
thou
now
the
foundations
of
tall
carthage
and
buildest
up
a
fair
city
in
dalliance
ah
forgetful
of
thine
own
kingdom
and
state
from
bright
olympus
i
descend
to
thee
at
express
command
of
heaven
sovereign
whose
deity
sways
sky
and
earth
expressly
he
bids
me
carry
this
charge
through
the
fleet
air
with
what
device
or
in
what
hope
dost
thou
loiter
idly
on
libyan
lands
if
such
glories
kindle
thee
in
nowise
yet
cast
an
eye
on
growing
ascanius
on
iülus
thine
hope
and
heir
to
whom
the
kingdom
of
italy
and
the
roman
land
are
due
as
these
words
left
his
lips
the
cyllenian
yet
speaking
quitted
mortal
sight
and
vanished
into
thin
air
away
out
of
his
eyes
but
aeneas
in
truth
gazed
in
dumb
amazement
his
hair
thrilled
up
and
the
accents
faltered
on
his
tongue
he
burns
to
flee
away
and
leave
the
pleasant
land
aghast
at
the
high
warning
and
divine
ordinance
alas
what
shall
he
do
how
venture
to
smooth
the
tale
to
the
frenzied
queen
what
prologue
shall
he
find
and
this
way
and
that
he
rapidly
throws
his
mind
and
turns
it
on
all
hands
in
swift
change
of
thought
in
his
perplexity
this
seemed
the
better
counsel
he
calls
mnestheus
and
sergestus
and
brave
serestus
and
bids
them
silently
equip
the
fleet
gather
their
crews
on
shore
and
order
their
armament
keeping
the
cause
of
the
commotion
hid
himself
meanwhile
since
dido
the
gracious
knows
not
nor
looks
for
severance
to
so
strong
a
love
will
essay
to
approach
her
when
she
may
be
told
most
gently
and
the
way
for
it
be
fair
all
at
once
gladly
do
as
bidden
and
obey
his
command
but
the
queen
who
may
delude
a
lover
foreknew
his
devices
and
at
once
caught
the
presaging
stir
safety
self
was
fear
to
her
likewise
had
evil
rumour
borne
the
maddening
news
that
they
equip
the
fleet
and
prepare
for
passage
helpless
at
heart
she
reels
aflame
with
rage
throughout
the
city
even
as
the
startled
thyiad
in
her
frenzied
triennial
orgies
when
the
holy
vessels
move
forth
and
the
cry
of
bacchus
and
cithaeron
calls
her
with
nightlong
din
thus
at
last
she
opens
out
upon
aeneas
thou
didst
hope
traitor
to
mask
the
crime
and
slip
away
in
silence
from
my
land
our
love
holds
thee
not
nor
the
hand
thou
once
gavest
nor
the
bitter
death
that
is
left
for
dido
portion
nay
under
the
wintry
star
thou
labourest
on
thy
fleet
and
hastenest
to
launch
into
the
deep
amid
northern
gales
ah
cruel
why
were
thy
quest
not
of
alien
fields
and
unknown
dwellings
did
thine
ancient
troy
remain
should
troy
be
sought
in
voyages
over
tossing
seas
fliest
thou
from
me
me
who
by
these
tears
and
thine
own
hand
beseech
thee
since
naught
else
alas
have
i
kept
mine
own
by
our
union
and
the
marriage
rites
preparing
if
i
have
done
thee
any
grace
or
aught
of
mine
hath
once
been
sweet
in
thy
sight
pity
our
sinking
house
and
if
there
yet
be
room
for
prayers
put
off
this
purpose
of
thine
for
thy
sake
libyan
tribes
and
nomad
kings
are
hostile
my
tyrians
are
estranged
for
thy
sake
thine
is
mine
honour
perished
and
the
former
fame
my
one
title
to
the
skies
how
leavest
thou
me
to
die
o
my
guest
since
to
this
the
name
of
husband
is
dwindled
down
for
what
do
i
wait
till
pygmalion
overthrow
his
sister
city
or
gaetulian
iarbas
lead
me
to
captivity
at
least
if
before
thy
flight
a
child
of
thine
had
been
clasped
in
my
arms
if
a
tiny
aeneas
were
playing
in
my
hall
whose
face
might
yet
image
thine
i
would
not
think
myself
ensnared
and
deserted
utterly
she
ended
he
by
counsel
of
jove
held
his
gaze
unstirred
and
kept
his
distress
hard
down
in
his
heart
at
last
he
briefly
answers
o
queen
will
i
deny
that
thy
goodness
hath
gone
high
as
thy
words
can
swell
the
reckoning
nor
will
my
memory
of
elissa
be
ungracious
while
i
remember
myself
and
breath
sways
this
body
little
will
i
say
in
this
i
never
hoped
to
slip
away
in
stealthy
flight
fancy
not
that
nor
did
i
ever
hold
out
the
marriage
torch
or
enter
thus
into
alliance
did
fate
allow
me
to
guide
my
life
by
mine
own
government
and
calm
my
sorrows
as
i
would
my
first
duty
were
to
the
trojan
city
and
the
dear
remnant
of
my
kindred
the
high
house
of
priam
should
abide
and
my
hand
had
set
up
troy
towers
anew
for
a
conquered
people
but
now
for
broad
italy
hath
apollo
of
grynos
bidden
me
steer
for
italy
the
oracles
of
lycia
here
is
my
desire
this
is
my
native
country
if
thy
phoenician
eyes
are
stayed
on
carthage
towers
and
thy
libyan
city
what
wrong
is
it
i
pray
that
we
trojans
find
our
rest
on
ausonian
land
we
too
may
seek
a
foreign
realm
unforbidden
in
my
sleep
often
as
the
dank
shades
of
night
veil
the
earth
often
as
the
stars
lift
their
fires
the
troubled
phantom
of
my
father
anchises
comes
in
warning
and
dread
my
boy
ascanius
how
i
wrong
one
so
dear
in
cheating
him
of
an
hesperian
kingdom
and
destined
fields
now
even
the

interpreter
sent
straight
from
jove
i
call
both
to
witness
hath
borne
down
his
commands
through
the
fleet
air
myself
in
broad
daylight
i
saw
the
deity
passing
within
the
walls
and
these
ears
drank
his
utterance
cease
to
madden
me
and
thyself
alike
with
plaints
not
of
my
will
do
i
follow
italy
long
ere
he
ended
she
gazes
on
him
askance
turning
her
eyes
from
side
to
side
and
perusing
him
with
silent
glances
then
thus
wrathfully
speaks
goddess
was
thy
mother
nor
dardanus
founder
of
thy
line
traitor
but
rough
caucasus
bore
thee
on
his
iron
crags
and
hyrcanian
tigresses
gave
thee
suck
for
why
do
i
conceal
it
for
what
further
outrage
do
i
wait
hath
our
weeping
cost
him
a
sigh
or
a
lowered
glance
hath
he
broken
into
tears
or
had
pity
on
his
lover
where
where
shall
i
begin
now
neither
doth
queen
juno
nor
our
saturnian
lord
regard
us
with
righteous
eyes
nowhere
is
trust
safe
cast
ashore
and
destitute
i
welcomed
him
and
madly
gave
him
place
and
portion
in
my
kingdom
i
found
him
his
lost
fleet
and
drew
his
crews
from
death
alas
the
fire
of
madness
speeds
me
on
now
prophetic
apollo
now
oracles
of
lycia
now
the
very
gods
interpreter
sent
straight
from
jove
through
the
air
carries
these
rude
commands
truly
that
is
work
for
the
gods
that
a
care
to
vex
their
peace
i
detain
thee
not
nor
gainsay
thy
words
go
follow
thine
italy
down
the
wind
seek
thy
realm
overseas
yet
midway
my
hope
is
if
righteous
gods
can
do
aught
at
all
thou
wilt
drain
the
cup
of
vengeance
on
the
rocks
and
calls
on
dido
name
in
murky
fires
i
will
follow
far
away
and
when
chill
death
hath
severed
body
from
soul
my
ghost
will
haunt
thee
in
every
region
wretch
thou
shalt
repay
i
will
hear
and
the
rumour
of
it
shall
reach
me
deep
in
the
under
world
even
on
these
words
she
breaks
off
her
speech
unfinished
and
sick
at
heart
escapes
out
of
the
air
and
sweeps
round
and
away
out
of
sight
leaving
him
in
fear
and
much
hesitance
and
with
much
on
his
mind
to
say
her
women
catch
her
in
their
arms
and
carry
her
swooning
to
her
marble
chamber
and
lay
her
on
her
bed
but
good
aeneas
though
he
would
fain
soothe
and
comfort
her
grief
and
talk
away
her
distress
with
many
a
sigh
and
melted
in
soul
by
his
great
love
yet
fulfils
the
divine
commands
and
returns
to
his
fleet
then
indeed
the
teucrians
set
to
work
and
haul
down
their
tall
ships
all
along
the
shore
the
hulls
are
oiled
and
afloat
they
carry
from
the
woodland
green
boughs
for
oars
and
massy
logs
unhewn
in
hot
haste
to
go
one
might
descry
them
shifting
their
quarters
and
pouring
out
of
all
the
town
even
as
ants
mindful
of
winter
plunder
a
great
heap
of
wheat
and
store
it
in
their
house
a
black
column
advances
on
the
plain
as
they
carry
home
their
spoil
on
a
narrow
track
through
the
grass
some
shove
and
strain
with
their
shoulders
at
big
grains
some
marshal
the
ranks
and
chastise
delay
all
the
path
is
aswarm
with
work
what
then
were
thy
thoughts
o
dido
as
thou
sawest
it
what
sighs
didst
thou
utter
viewing
from
the
fortress
roof
the
broad
beach
aswarm
and
seeing
before
thine
eyes
the
whole
sea
stirred
with
their
noisy
din
injurious
love
to
what
dost
thou
not
compel
mortal
hearts
again
she
must
needs
break
into
tears
again
essay
entreaty
and
bow
her
spirit
down
to
love
not
to
leave
aught
untried
and
go
to
death
in
vain
thou
seest
the
bustle
that
fills
the
shore
they
have
gathered
round
from
every
quarter
already
their
canvas
woos
the
breezes
and
the
merry
sailors
have
garlanded
the
sterns
this
great
pain
my
sister
i
shall
have
strength
to
bear
as
i
have
had
strength
to
foresee
yet
this
one
thing
anna
for
love
and
pity
sake
for
of
thee
alone
was
the
traitor
fain
to
thee
even
his
secret
thoughts
were
confided
alone
thou
knewest
his
moods
and
tender
fits
go
my
sister
and
humbly
accost
the
haughty
stranger
i
did
not
take
the
grecian
oath
in
aulis
to
root
out
the
race
of
troy
i
sent
no
fleet
against
her
fortresses
neither
have
i
disentombed
his
father
anchises
ashes
and
ghost
that
he
should
refuse
my
words
entrance
to
his
stubborn
ears
whither
does
he
run
let
him
grant
this
grace
alas
the
last
to
his
lover
and
await
fair
winds
and
an
easy
passage
no
more
do
i
pray
for
the
old
delusive
marriage
nor
that
he
give
up
fair
latium
and
abandon
a
kingdom
a
i
ask
to
give
my
madness
rest
and
room
till
my
very
fortune
teach
my
grief
submission
this
last
favour
i
implore
sister
be
pitiful
grant
this
to
me
and
i
will
restore
it
in
full
measure
when
i
die
so
she
pleaded
and
so
her
sister
carries
and
recarries
the
piteous
tale
of
weeping
but
by
no
weeping
is
he
stirred
inflexible
to
all
the
words
he
hears
fate
withstands
and
lays
divine
bars
on
unmoved
mortal
ears
even
as
when
the
eddying
blasts
of
northern
alpine
winds
are
emulous
to
uproot
the
secular
strength
of
a
mighty
oak
it
wails
on
and
the
trunk
quivers
and
the
high
foliage
strews
the
ground
the
tree
clings
fast
on
the
rocks
and
high
as
her
top
soars
into
heaven
so
deep
strike
her
roots
to
hell
even
thus
is
the
hero
buffeted
with
changeful
perpetual
accents
and
distress
thrills
his
mighty
breast
while
his
purpose
stays
unstirred
and
tears
fall
in
vain
then
indeed
hapless
and
dismayed
by
doom
dido
prays
for
death
and
is
weary
of
gazing
on
the
arch
of
heaven
the
more
to
make
her
fulfil
her
purpose
and
quit
the
light
she
saw
when
she
laid
her
gifts
on
the
altars
alight
with
incense
awful
to
tell
the
holy
streams
blacken
and
the
wine
turn
as
it
poured
into
ghastly
blood
of
this
sight
she
spoke
to
none
no
not
to
her
sister
likewise
there
was
within
the
house
a
marble
temple
of
her
ancient
lord
kept
of
her
in
marvellous
honour
and
fastened
with
snowy
fleeces
and
festal
boughs
forth
of
it
she
seemed
to
hear
her
husband
voice
crying
and
calling
when
night
was
dim
upon
earth
and
alone
on
the
the
often
made
moan
with
funeral
note
and
sobbing
cry
therewithal
many
a
warning
of
wizards
of
old
terrifies
her
with
appalling
presage
in
her
sleep
fierce
aeneas
drives
her
wildly
and
ever
she
seems
being
left
by
herself
alone
ever
going
uncompanioned
on
a
weary
way
and
seeking
her
tyrians
in
a
solitary
land
even
as
frantic
pentheus
sees
the
arrayed
furies
and
a
double
sun
and
thebes
shows
herself
twofold
to
his
eyes
or
agamemnonian
orestes
renowned
in
tragedy
when
his
mother
pursues
him
armed
with
torches
and
dark
serpents
and
the
fatal
sisters
crouch
avenging
in
the
doorway
so
when
overcome
by
her
pangs
she
caught
the
madness
and
resolved
to
die
she
works
out
secretly
the
time
and
fashion
and
accosts
her
sorrowing
sister
with
mien
hiding
her
design
and
hope
calm
on
her
brow
have
found
a
way
mine
own
wish
me
joy
sisterlike
to
restore
him
to
me
or
release
me
of
my
love
for
him
hard
by
the
ocean
limit
and
the
set
of
sun
is
the
extreme
aethiopian
land
where
ancient
atlas
turns
on
his
shoulders
the
starred
burning
axletree
of
heaven
out
of
it
hath
been
shown
to
me
a
priestess
of
massylian
race
warder
of
the
temple
of
the
hesperides
even
she
who
gave
the
dragon
his
food
and
kept
the
holy
boughs
on
the
tree
sprinkling
clammy
honey
and
slumberous
she
professes
with
her
spells
to
relax
the
purposes
of
whom
she
will
but
on
others
to
bring
passion
and
pain
to
stay
the
and
turn
the
stars
backward
she
calls
up
ghosts
by
night
thou
shalt
see
earth
moaning
under
foot
and
descending
from
the
hills
i
take
heaven
sweet
to
witness
and
thee
mine
own
darling
sister
i
do
not
willingly
arm
myself
with
the
arts
of
magic
do
thou
secretly
raise
a
pyre
in
the
inner
court
and
let
them
lay
on
it
the
arms
that
the
accursed
one
left
hanging
in
our
chamber
and
all
the
dress
he
wore
and
the
bridal
bed
where
i
fell
it
is
good
to
wipe
out
all
the
traces
and
the
priestess
orders
thus
so
speaks
she
and
is
silent
while
pallor
overruns
her
face
yet
anna
deems
not
her
sister
veils
death
behind
these
strange
rites
and
grasps
not
her
wild
purpose
nor
fears
aught
deeper
than
at
sychaeus
death
so
she
makes
ready
as
bidden
but
the
queen
the
pyre
being
built
up
of
piled
faggots
and
sawn
ilex
in
the
inmost
of
her
dwelling
hangs
the
room
with
chaplets
and
garlands
it
with
funeral
boughs
on
the
pillow
she
lays
the
dress
he
wore
the
sword
he
left
and
an
image
of
him
knowing
what
was
to
come
altars
are
reared
around
and
the
priestess
with
hair
undone
thrice
peals
from
her
lips
the
hundred
gods
of
erebus
and
chaos
and
the
triform
hecate
the
maidenhood
of
diana
likewise
she
had
sprinkled
pretended
waters
of
avernus
spring
and
rank
herbs
are
sought
mown
by
moonlight
with
brazen
sickles
dark
with
milky
venom
and
sought
is
the
talisman
torn
from
a
horse
forehead
at
birth
ere
the
dam
could
snatch
it
herself
the
holy
cake
in
her
pure
hands
hard
by
the
altars
with
one
foot
unshod
and
garments
flowing
loose
she
invokes
the
gods
ere
she
die
and
the
stars
that
know
of
doom
then
prays
to
whatsoever
deity
looks
in
righteousness
and
remembrance
on
lovers
ill
allied
night
fell
weary
creatures
took
quiet
slumber
all
over
earth
and
woodland
and
wild
waters
had
sunk
to
rest
now
the
stars
wheel
midway
on
their
gliding
path
now
all
the
country
is
silent
and
beasts
and
gay
birds
that
haunt
liquid
levels
of
lake
or
thorny
rustic
thicket
lay
couched
asleep
under
the
still
night
but
not
so
the
distressed
phoenician
nor
does
she
ever
sink
asleep
or
take
the
night
upon
eyes
or
breast
her
pain
redoubles
and
her
love
swells
to
renewed
madness
as
she
tosses
on
the
strong
tide
of
wrath
even
so
she
begins
and
thus
revolves
with
her
heart
alone
what
do
i
shall
i
again
make
trial
of
mine
old
wooers
that
will
scorn
me
and
stoop
to
sue
for
a
numidian
marriage
among
those
whom
already
over
and
over
i
have
disdained
for
husbands
then
shall
i
follow
the
ilian
fleets
and
the
uttermost
bidding
of
the
teucrians
because
it
is
good
to
think
they
were
once
raised
up
by
my
succour
or
the
grace
of
mine
old
kindness
is
fresh
in
their
remembrance
and
how
should
they
let
me
if
i
would
or
take
the
odious
woman
on
their
haughty
ships
art
thou
ignorant
ah
me
even
in
ruin
and
knowest
not
yet
the
forsworn
race
of
laomedon
and
then
shall
i
accompany
the
triumphant
sailors
a
lonely
fugitive
or
plunge
forth
girt
with
all
my
tyrian
train
so
hardly
severed
from
sidon
city
shall
i
again
drive
them
seaward
and
bid
them
spread
their
sails
to
the
tempest
nay
die
thou
as
thou
deservest
and
let
the
steel
end
thy
pain
with
thee
it
began
overborne
by
my
tears
thou
o
my
sister
dost
load
me
with
this
madness
and
agony
and
layest
me
open
to
the
enemy
i
could
not
spend
a
wild
life
without
stain
far
from
a
bridal
chamber
and
free
from
touch
of
distress
like
this
o
faith
ill
kept
that
was
plighted
to
ashes
thus
her
heart
broke
in
long
lamentation
now
aeneas
was
fixed
to
go
and
now
with
all
set
duly
in
order
was
taking
hasty
sleep
on
his
high
stern
to
him
as
he
slept
the
god
appeared
once
again
in
the
same
fashion
of
countenance
and
thus
seemed
to
renew
his
warning
in
all
points
like
to
mercury
voice
and
hue
and
golden
hair
and
limbs
gracious
in
youth
canst
thou
sleep
on
in
such
danger
and
seest
not
the
coming
perils
that
hem
thee
in
madman
nor
hearest
the
breezes
blowing
fair
she
fixed
on
death
is
revolving
craft
and
crime
grimly
in
her
bosom
and
swells
the
changing
surge
of
wrath
fliest
thou
not
hence
headlong
while
headlong
flight
is
yet
possible
even
now
wilt
thou
see
ocean
weltering
with
broken
timbers
see
the
fierce
glare
of
torches
and
the
beach
in
a
riot
of
flame
if
dawn
break
on
thee
yet
dallying
in
this
land
up
ho
linger
no
more
woman
is
ever
a
fickle
and
changing
thing
so
spoke
he
and
melted
in
the
black
night
then
indeed
aeneas
startled
by
the
sudden
phantom
leaps
out
of
slumber
and
bestirs
his
crew
and
awake
o
men
and
sit
down
to
the
thwarts
shake
out
sail
speedily
a
god
sent
from
high
heaven
lo
again
spurs
us
to
speed
our
flight
and
cut
the
twisted
cables
we
follow
thee
holy
one
of
heaven
whoso
thou
art
and
again
joyfully
obey
thy
command
o
be
favourable
give
gracious
aid
and
bring
fair
sky
and
weather
he
spoke
and
snatching
his
sword
like
lightning
from
the
sheath
strikes
at
the
hawser
with
the
drawn
steel
the
same
zeal
catches
all
at
once
rushing
and
tearing
they
quit
the
shore
the
sea
is
hidden
under
their
fleets
strongly
they
toss
up
the
foam
and
sweep
the
blue
water
and
now
dawn
broke
and
leaving
the
saffron
bed
of
tithonus
shed
her
radiance
anew
over
the
world
when
the
queen
saw
from
her
the
first
light
whitening
and
the
fleet
standing
out
under
squared
sail
and
discerned
shore
and
haven
empty
of
all
their
oarsmen
thrice
and
four
times
she
struck
her
hand
on
her
lovely
breast
and
rent
her
yellow
hair
she
cries
he
go
shall
an
alien
make
mock
of
our
realm
will
they
not
issue
in
armed
pursuit
from
all
the
city
and
some
launch
ships
from
the
dockyards
go
bring
fire
in
haste
serve
weapons
swing
out
the
oars
what
do
i
talk
or
where
am
i
what
mad
change
is
on
my
purpose
alas
dido
now
thou
dost
feel
thy
wickedness
that
had
graced
thee
once
when
thou
gavest
away
thy
crown
behold
the
faith
and
hand
of
him
who
they
say
carries
his
household
ancestral
gods
about
with
him
who
stooped
his
shoulders
to
a
father
outworn
with
age
could
i
not
have
riven
his
body
in
sunder
and
strewn
it
on
the
waves
and
slain
with
the
sword
his
comrades
and
his
dear
ascanius
and
served
him
for
the
banquet
at
his
father
table
but
the
chance
of
battle
had
been
dubious
if
it
had
whom
did
i
fear
with
my
death
upon
me
i
should
have
borne
firebrands
into
his
camp
and
filled
his
decks
with
flame
blotted
out
father
and
son
and
race
together
and
flung
myself
atop
of
all
sun
whose
fires
lighten
all
the
works
of
the
world
and
thou
juno
mediatress
and
witness
of
these
my
distresses
and
hecate
cried
on
by
night
in
crossways
of
cities
and
you
fatal
avenging
sisters
and
gods
of
dying
elissa
hear
me
now
bend
your
just
deity
to
my
woes
and
listen
to
our
prayers
if
it
must
needs
be
that
the
accursed
one
touch
his
haven
and
float
up
to
land
if
thus
decrees
demand
and
this
is
the
appointed
term
yet
distressed
in
war
by
an
armed
and
gallant
nation
driven
homeless
from
his
borders
rent
from
iülus
embrace
let
him
sue
for
succour
and
see
death
on
death
untimely
on
his
people
nor
when
he
hath
yielded
him
to
the
terms
of
a
harsh
peace
may
he
have
joy
of
his
kingdom
or
the
pleasant
light
but
let
him
fall
before
his
day
and
without
burial
on
a
waste
of
sand

i
pray
this
and
my
blood
with
it
i
pour

the

utterance
and
you
o
tyrians
hunt
his
seed
with
your
hatred
for
all

to

send
this
guerdon
to
our
ashes
let
no
kindness
nor
truce
be
between
the
nations
arise
out
of
our
dust
o
unnamed
avenger
to
pursue
the
dardanian
settlement
with
firebrand
and
steel
now
then
whensoever
strength
shall
be
given
i
invoke
the
enmity
of
shore

to

sword
to

let
their
battles
go
down
to
their
children
so
speaks
she
as
she
kept
turning
her
mind
round
about
seeking
how
soonest
to
break
away
from
the
hateful
light
thereon
she
speaks
briefly
to
barce
nurse
of
sychaeus
for
a
heap
of
dusky
ashes
held
her
own
in
her
country
of
long

nurse
bring
anna
my

hither
to
me
bid
her
haste
and
sprinkle
river
water
over
her
body
and
bring
with
her
the
beasts
ordained
for
expiation
so
let
her
come
and
thou
likewise
veil
thy
brows
with
a
pure
chaplet
i
would
fulfil
the
rites
of
stygian
jove
that
i
have
fitly
ordered
and
begun
so
to
set
the
limit
to
my
distresses
and
give
over
to
the
flames
the
funeral
pyre
of
the
dardanian
so
speaks
she
the
old
woman
went
eagerly
with
quickened
pace
but
dido
fluttered
and
fierce
in
her
awful
purpose
with
bloodshot
restless
gaze
and
spots
on
her
quivering
cheeks
burning
through
the
pallor
of
imminent
death
bursts
into
the
inner
courts
of
the
house
and
mounts
in
madness
the
high
funeral
pyre
and
unsheathes
the
sword
of
dardania
a
gift
asked
for
no
use
like
this
then
after
her
eyes
fell
on
the
ilian
raiment
and
the
bed
she
knew
dallying
a
little
with
her
purpose
through
her
tears
she
sank
on
the
pillow
and
spoke
the
last
words
of
all
he
wore
sweet
while
doom
and
deity
allowed
receive
my
spirit
now
and
release
me
from
my
distresses
i
have
lived
and
fulfilled
fortune
allotted
course
and
now
shall
i
go
a
queenly
phantom
under
the
earth
i
have
built
a
renowned
city
i
have
seen
my
ramparts
rise
by
my
brother
punishment
i
have
avenged
my
husband
of
his
enemy
happy
ah
me
and
over
happy
had
but
the
keels
of
dardania
never
touched
our
shores
she
spoke
and
burying
her
face
in
the
pillow
it
will
be
she
cries
unavenged
but
death
be
it
thus
thus
is
it
good
to
pass
into
the
dark
let
the
pitiless
dardanian
gaze
drink
in
this
fire
out
at
sea
and
my
death
be
the
omen
he
carries
on
his
way
she
ceased
and
even
as
she
spoke
her
people
see
her
sunk
on
the
steel
and
blood
reeking
on
the
sword
and
spattered
on
her
hands
a
cry
rises
in
the
high
halls
rumour
riots
down
the
quaking
city
the
house
resounds
with
lamentation
and
sobbing
and
bitter
crying
of
women
heaven
echoes
their
loud
wails
even
as
though
all
carthage
or
ancient
tyre
went
down
as
the
foe
poured
in
and
the
flames
rolled
furious
over
the
roofs
of
house
and
temple
swooning
at
the
sound
her
sister
runs
in
a
flutter
of
dismay
with
torn
face
and
smitten
bosom
and
darts
through
them
all
and
calls
the
dying
woman
by
her
name
it
this
mine
own
was
my
summons
a
snare
was
it
this
thy
pyre
ah
me
this
thine
altar
fires
meant
how
shall
i
begin
my
desolate
moan
didst
thou
disdain
a
sister
company
in
death
thou
shouldst
have
called
me
to
share
thy
doom
in
the
hour
the
pang
of
steel
had
been
our
portion
did
these
very
hands
build
it
did
my
voice
call
on
our
father
gods
that
with
thee
lying
thus
i
should
be
away
as
one
without
pity
thou
hast
destroyed
thyself
and
me
together
o
my
sister
and
the
sidonian
lords
and
people
and
this
thy
city
give
her
wounds
water
i
will
bathe
them
and
catch
on
my
lips
the
last
breath
that
haply
yet
lingers
so
speaking
she
had
climbed
the
high
steps
and
wailing
clasped
and
caressed
her
sister
in
her
bosom
and
stanched
the
dark
streams
of
blood
with
her
gown
she
essaying
to
lift
her
heavy
eyes
swoons
back
the
wound
gurgles
in
her
breast
thrice
she
rose
and
strained
to
lift
herself
on
her
elbow
thrice
she
rolled
back
on
the
pillow
and
with
wandering
eyes
sought
the
light
of
high
heaven
and
moaned
as
she
found
it
then
juno
omnipotent
pitying
her
long
pain

difficult
decease

down
from

to
unloose
the
struggling
life
from
the
body
where
it
clung
for
since
neither
by
fate
did
she
perish
nor
as
one
who
had
earned
her
death
but
woefully
before
her
day
and
fired
by
sudden
madness
not
yet
had
proserpine
taken
her
lock
from
the
golden
head

sentenced
her
to

iris

down
through

athwart
the

take
as

thee
from

thine
so
speaks
she
and
cuts
it
with

and
therewith

from

slid
out

and
again
leaving

out

out

to
take

here
lord
aeneas
set
up
a
goal
of
leafy
ilex
a
mark
for
the
sailors
to
know
whence
to
return
where
to
wheel
their
long
course
round
then
they
choose
stations
by
lot
and
on
the
sterns
their
captains
glitter
afar
beautiful
in
gold
and
purple
the
rest
of
the
crews
are
crowned
with
poplar
sprays
and
their
naked
shoulders
glisten
wet
with
oil
they
sit
down
at
the
thwarts
and
their
arms
are
tense
on
the
oars
at
full
strain
they
wait
the
signal
while
throbbing
fear
and
heightened
ambition
drain
their
riotous
blood
then
when
the
clear
rang
all
in
a
moment
leap
forward
from
their
line
the
shouts
of
the
sailors
strike
up
to
heaven
and
the
channels
are
swept
into
foam
by
the
arms
as
they
swing
backward
they
cleave
their
furrows
together
and
all
the
sea
is
torn
asunder
by
oars
and
prows
not
with
speed
so
headlong
do
racing
pairs
whirl
the
chariots
over
the
plain
as
they
rush
streaming
from
the
barriers
not
so
do
their
charioteers
shake
the
wavy
reins
loose
over
their
team
and
hang
forward
on
the
whip
all
the
woodland
rings
with
clapping
and
shouts
of
men
that
cheer
their
favourites
and
the
sheltered
beach
eddies
back
their
cries
the
noise
buffets
and
from
the
hills
gyas
shoots
out
in
front
of
the
noisy
crowd
and
glides
foremost
along
the
water
whom
cloanthus
follows
next
rowing
better
but
held
back
by
his
dragging
weight
of
pine
after
them
at
equal
distance
the
dragon
and
the
centaur
strive
to
win
the
foremost
room
and
now
the
dragon
has
it
now
the
vast
centaur
outstrips
and
passes
her
now
they
dart
on
both
together
their
stems
in
a
line
and
their
keels
driving
long
furrows
through
the
salt
and
now
they
drew
nigh
the
rock
and
were
hard
on
the
goal
when
gyas
as
he
led
winner
over
half
the
flood
cries
aloud
to
menoetes
the
ship
steersman
away
so
far
to
the
right
this
way
direct
her
path
kiss
the
shore
and
let
the
oarblade
graze
the
leftward
reefs
others
may
keep
to
deep
water
he
spoke
but
menoetes
fearing
blind
rocks
turns
the
bow
away
towards
the
open
sea
wanderest
thou
away
to
the
rocks
menoetes
again
shouts
gyas
to
bring
him
back
and
lo
glancing
round
he
sees
cloanthus
passing
up
behind
and
keeping
nearer
between
gyas
ship
and
the
echoing
crags
he
scrapes
through
inside
on
his
left
flashes
past
his
leader
and
leaving
the
goal
behind
is
in
safe
water
then
indeed
grief
burned
fierce
through
his
strong
frame
and
tears
sprung
out
on
his
cheeks
heedless
of
his
own
dignity
and
his
crew
safety
he
flings
the
too
cautious
menoetes
sheer
into
the
sea
from
the
high
stern
himself
succeeds
as
guide
and
master
of
the
helm
and
cheers
on
his
men
and
turns
his
tiller
in
to
shore
but
menoetes
when
at
last
he
rose
struggling
from

in

clothes
makes
for
the
top
of

sits
down
on
a
dry
rock
the
teucrians
laughed
out
as
he
fell
and
as
he
swam
and
laugh
to
see
him
spitting
the
salt
water
from
his
chest
at
this
a
joyful
hope
kindled
in
the
two
behind
sergestus
and
mnestheus
of
catching
up
wavering

sergestus

as
he

put
forth
the
might

you
showed
in

the

coming
in

win
but
this
and
avert
that
disaster
his
men
bend
forward
straining
every
muscle
the
brasswork
of
the
ship
quivers
to
their
mighty
strokes
and
the
ground
runs
from
under

limbs
and
parched
lips
shake
with
their
rapid
panting
and
sweat
flows
in
streams
all
over

mere

brought
the
crew
the
glory
they
desired
for
while
sergestus
drives
his
prow
furiously
in
towards
the
rocks
and
comes
up
with
too
scanty
room
alas
he
caught
on
a
rock
that
ran
out
the
reef
ground
the
oars
struck
and
shivered
on
the
jagged
teeth
and
the
bows
crashed
and
hung
the
sailors
leap
up
and
hold
her
with
loud
cries
and
get
out
poles
and
boathooks
and
pick
up
their
broken
oars
out
of
the
eddies
but
mnestheus
rejoicing
and
flushed
by
his
triumph
with
oars
and
winds
at
his
call
issues
into
the
shelving
water
and
runs
down
the
open
sea
as
a
pigeon
whose
house
and
sweet
nestlings
are
in
the
recesses
if
suddenly
startled
from
her
cavern
wings
her
flight
over
the
fields
and
rushes
frightened
from
her
house
with
loud
clapping
pinions
then
gliding
noiselessly
through
the
air
slides
on
her
liquid
way
and
moves
not
her
rapid
wings
so
mnestheus
so
the
dragon
under
him
swiftly
cleaves
the
last
space
of
sea
so
her
own
speed
carries
her
flying
on
and
first
sergestus
is
left
behind
struggling
on
the
steep
rock
and
shoal
water
and
shouting
in
vain
for
help
and
learning
to
race
with
broken
oars
next
he
catches
up
gyas
and
the
vast
bulk
of
the
chimaera
she
gives
way
without
her
steersman
and
now
on
the
very
goal
cloanthus
alone
is
left
him
he
pursues
and
presses
hard
straining
all
his
strength
then
indeed
the
shouts
redouble
as
all
together
eagerly
cheer
on
the
pursuer
and
the
sky
echoes
their
din
these
scorn
to
lose
the
honour
that
is
their
own
the
glory
in
their
grasp
and
would
sell
life
for
renown
to
these
success
lends
life
power
comes
with
belief
in
it
and
haply
they
had
carried
the
prize
with
prows
abreast
had
not
cloanthus
stretching
both
his
open
hands
over
the
sea
poured
forth
prayers
and
called
the
gods
to
hear
his
vows
who
are
sovereign
on
the
sea
over
whose
waters
i
run
to
your
altars
on
this
beach
will
i
bring
a
bull
my
vow
glad
penalty
and
will
cast
his
entrails
into
the
salt
flood
and
pour
liquid
wine
he
spoke
and
far
beneath
the
flood
maiden
panopea
heard
him
with
all
choir
of
nereids
and
lord
portunus
with
his
own
mighty
hand
pushed
him
on
his
way
the
ship
flies
to
land
swifter
than
the
wind
or
an
flight
and
shoots
into
the
deep
harbour
then
the
seed
of
anchises
summoning
all
in
order
declares
cloanthus
conqueror
by
herald
outcry
and
dresses
his
brows
in
green
bay
and
gives
gifts
to
each
crew
three
bullocks
of
their
choice
and
wine
and
a
large
talent
of
silver
to
take
away
for
their
captains
he
adds
special
honours
to
the
winner
a
scarf
wrought
with
gold
encircled
by
a
double
border
of
deep
meliboean
purple
woven
in
it
is
the
kingly
boy
on
leafy
ida
chasing
swift
stags
with
javelin
and
racing
feet
keen
and
as
one
panting
him
swooping
hath
caught
up
from
ida
in
his
talons
his
aged
guardians
stretch
their
hands
vainly
upwards
and
the
barking
of
hounds
rings
fierce
into
the
air
but
to
him
who
next
in
merit
held
the
second
place
he
gives
to
wear
a
corslet
with
hooks
of
polished
gold
stripped
by
his
own
conquering
hand
from
demoleos
under
tall
troy
by
the
swift
simoïs
an
ornament
and
safeguard
among
arms
scarce
could
the
straining
shoulders
of
his
servants
phegeus
and
sagaris
carry
its
heavy
folds
yet
with
it
on
demoleos
at
full
speed
would
chase
the
scattered
trojans
the
third
prize
he
makes
twin
cauldrons
of
brass
and
bowls
wrought
in
silver
and
rough
with
tracery
and
now
all
moved
away
in
the
pride
and
wealth
of
their
prizes
their
brows
bound
with
scarlet
ribbons
when
hardly
torn
loose
by
all
his
art
from
the
cruel
rock
his
oars
lost
rowing
feebly
with
a
single
tier
sergestus
brought
in
his
ship
jeered
at
and
unhonoured
even
as
often
a
serpent
caught
on
a
highway
if
a
brazen
wheel
hath
gone
aslant
over
him
or
a
wayfarer
left
him
half
dead
and
mangled
with
the
blow
of
a
heavy
stone
wreathes
himself
slowly
in
vain
effort
to
escape
in
part
undaunted
his
eyes
ablaze
and
his
hissing
throat
lifted
high
in
part
the
disabling
wound
keeps
him
coiling
in
knots
and
twisting
back
on
his
own
body
so
the
ship
kept
rowing
slowly
on
yet
hoists
sail
and
under
full
sail
glides
into
the
harbour
mouth
glad
that
the
ship
is
saved

with

none
out
of

number
will
i

to

and
on
the
link
of

clasp
a
polished
gem
let
the
third
depart
with
this
argolic
helmet
for
recompense
this
said
they
take
their
place
and
the
signal
once
heard
dart
over
the
course
and
leave
the
line
pouring
forth
like
a
while
they
mark
the
goal
nisus
gets
away
first
and
shoots
out
far
in
front
of
the
throng
fleeter
than
the
winds
or
the
winged
thunderbolt
next
to
him
but
next
by
a
long
gap
salius
follows
then
left
a
space
behind
him
euryalus
third
and
helymus
comes
after
euryalus
and
close
behind
him
lo
diores
goes
flying
just
grazing
foot
with
foot
hard
on
his
shoulder
and
if
a
longer
space
were
left
he
would
creep
out
past
him
and
win
the
tie
and
now
almost
in
the
last
space
they
began
to
come
up
breathless
to
the
goal
when
unfortunate
nisus
trips
on
the
slippery
blood
of
the
slain
steers
where
haply
it
had
spilled
over
the
ground
and
wetted
the
green
grass
here
just
in
the
flush
of
victory
he
lost
his
feet
they
slid
away
on
the
ground
they
pressed
and
he
fell
forward
right
among
the
ordure
and
blood
of
the
sacrifice
yet
forgot
he
not
his
darling
euryalus
for
rising
he
flung
himself
over
the
slippery
ground
in
front
of
salius
and
he
rolled
over
and
lay
all
along
on
the
hard
sand
euryalus
shoots
by
wins
and
holds
the
first
place
his
friend
gave
and
flies
on
amid
prosperous
clapping
and
cheers
behind
helymus
comes
up
and
diores
now
third
for
the
palm
at
this
salius
fills
with
loud
clamour
the
whole
concourse
of
the
vast
theatre
and
the
lords
who
looked
on
in
front
demanding
restoration
of
his
defrauded
prize
euryalus
is
strong
in
favour
and
beauty
in
tears
and
the
merit
that
gains
grace
from
so
fair
a
form
diores
supports
him
who
succeeded
to
the
palm
so
he
loudly
cries
and
bore
off
the
last
prize
in
vain
if
the
highest
honours
be
restored
to
salius
then
lord
aeneas
speaks
you
o
boys
your
rewards
remain
assured
and
none
alters
the
order
let
me
be
allowed
to
pity
a
friend
innocent
mischance
so
speaking
he
gives
to
salius
a
vast
gaetulian
with
shaggy
masses
of
hair
and
claws
of
gold
this
cries
nisus
the
reward
of
defeat
and
thy
pity
is
stirred
for
the
fallen
what
fit
recompense
wilt
thou
give
to
nisus
to
my
excellence
the
first
crown
was
due
had
not
i
like
salius
met
fortune
hostility
and
with
the
words
he
displayed
his
face
and
limbs
foul
with
the
wet
dung
his
lord
laughed
kindly
on
him
and
bade
a
shield
be
brought
forth
the
workmanship
of
didymaon
torn
by
him
from
the
hallowed
gates
of
neptune
grecian
temple
with
this
special
prize
he
rewards
his
excellence
thereafter
when
the
races
are
finished
and
the
gifts
fulfilled
he
cries
whoso
hath
in
him
valour
and
ready
heart
and
lift
up
his
arms
with
gauntleted
hands
so
speaks
he
and
sets
forth
a
double
prize
of
battle
for
the
conqueror
a
bullock
gilt
and
garlanded
a
sword
and
beautiful
helmet
to
console
the
conquered
straightway
without
pause
dares
issues
to
view
in
his
vast
strength
rising
amid
loud
murmurs
of
the
people
he
who
alone
was
wont
to
meet
paris
in
combat
he
who
at
the
mound
where
princely
hector
lies
struck
down
as
he
came
the
vast
bulk
upborne
by
conquering
butes
of
amycus
bebrycian
line
and
stretched
him
in
death
on
the
yellow
sand
such
was
dares
at
once
he
raises
his
head
high
for
battle
displays
his
broad
shoulders
and
stretches
and
swings
his
arms
right
and
left
lashing
the
air
with
blows
for
him
another
is
required
but
none
out
of
all
the
train
durst
approach
or
put
the
gloves
on
his
hands
so
he
takes
his
stand
exultant
before
aeneas
feet
deeming
he
excelled
all
in
victories
and
thereon
without
more
delay
grasps
the
bull
horn
with
his
left
hand
and
speaks
thus
if
no
man
dare
trust
himself
to
battle
to
what
conclusion
shall
i
stand
how
long
is
it
seemly
to
keep
me
bid
me
carry
off
thy
gifts
therewith
all
the
dardanians
murmured
assent
and
bade
yield
him
the
promised
prize
at
this
aged
acestes
spoke
sharply
to
entellus
as
he
sate
next
him
on
the
green
cushion
of
grass
bravest
of
heroes
once
of
old
in
vain
wilt
thou
thus
idly
let
a
gift
so
great
be
borne
away
uncontested
where
now
prithee
is
divine
eryx
thy
master
of
fruitless
fame
where
thy
renown
over
all
sicily
and
those
spoils
hanging
in
thine
house
thereat
he
of
glory
is
not
gone
nor
ambition
checked
by
fear
but
torpid
age
dulls
my
chilly
blood
and
my
strength
of
limb
is
numb
and
outworn
if
i
had
what
once
was
mine
if
i
had
now
that
prime
of
years
yonder
braggart
boast
and
confidence
it
had
taken
no
prize
of
goodly
bullock
to
allure
me
nor
heed
i
these
gifts
so
he
spoke
and
on
that
flung
down
a
pair
of
gloves
of
giant
weight
with
whose
hard
hide
bound
about
his
wrists
valiant
eryx
was
wont
to
come
to
battle
they
stood
amazed
so
stiff
and
grim
lay
the
vast
sevenfold
oxhide
sewed
in
with
lead
and
iron
dares
most
of
all
shrinks
far
back
in
horror
and
the
noble
son
of
anchises
turns
round
this
way
and
that
their
vast
weight
and
voluminous
folds
then
the
old
man
spoke
thus
in
deep
accents
had
they
seen
the
gloves
that
were
hercules
own
armour
and
the
fatal
fight
on
this
very
beach
these
arms
thy
brother
eryx
once
wore
thou
seest
them
yet
stained
with
blood
and
spattered
brains
in
them
he
stood
to
face
great
alcides
to
them
was
i
used
while
fuller
blood
supplied
me
strength
and
envious
old
age
had
not
yet
strewn
her
snows
on
either
temple
but
if
dares
of
troy
will
have
none
of
these
our
arms
and
good
aeneas
is
resolved
on
it
and
my
patron
acestes
approves
let
us
make
the
battle
even
see
i
give
up
the
gauntlets
of
eryx
dismiss
thy
fears
and
do
thou
put
off
thy
trojan
gloves
so
spoke
he
and
throwing
back
the
fold
of
his
raiment
from
his
shoulders
he
bares
the
massive
joints
and
limbs
the
great
bones
and
muscles
and
stands
up
huge
in
the
middle
of
the
ground
then
anchises
lordly
seed
brought
out
equal
gloves
and
bound
the
hands
of
both
in
matched
arms
straightway
each
took
his
stand
on
tiptoe
and
undauntedly
raised
his
arms
high
in
air
they
lift
their
heads
right
back
and
away
out
of
reach
of
blows
and
make
hand
play
through
hand
inviting
attack
the
one
nimbler
of
foot
and
confident
in
his
youth
the
other
mighty
in
mass
of
limb
but
his
knees
totter
tremulous
and
slow
and
sick
panting
shakes
his
vast
frame
many
a
mutual
blow
they
deliver
in
vain
many
an
one
they
redouble
on
chest
and
side
sounding
hollow
and
loud
hands
play
fast
about
ear
and
temple
and
jawbones
clash
under
the
hard
strokes
old
entellus
stands
immoveable
and
astrain
only
parrying
hits
with
body
and
watchful
eye
the
other
as
one
who
casts
mounts
against
some
high
city
or
blockades
a
in
arms
tries
this
and
that
entrance
and
ranges
cunningly
over
all
the
ground
and
presses
many
an
attack
in
vain
entellus
rose
and
struck
clean
out
with
his
right
downwards
his
quick
opponent
saw
the
descending
blow
before
it
came
and
slid
his
body
rapidly
out
of
its
way
entellus
hurled
his
strength
into
the
air
and
all
his
heavy
mass
overreaching
fell
heavily
to
the
earth
as
sometime
on
erymanthus
or
mighty
ida
a
hollow
pine
falls
torn
out
by
the
roots
teucrians
and
men
of
sicily
rise
eagerly
a
cry
goes
up
and
acestes
himself
runs
forward
and
pityingly
lifts
his
friend
and
birthmate
from
the
ground
but
the
hero
not
dulled
nor
dismayed
by
his
mishap
returns
the
keener
to
battle
and
grows
violent
in
wrath
while
shame
and
resolved
valour
kindle
his
strength
all
afire
he
hunts
dares
headlong
over
the
lists
and
redoubles
his
blows
now
with
right
hand
now
with
left
no
breath
nor
pause
heavy
as
hailstones
rattle
on
the
roof
from
a
so
thickly
shower
the
blows
from
both
his
hands
as
he
buffets
dares
to
and
fro
then
lord
aeneas
allowed
not
wrath
to
swell
higher
or
entellus
to
rage
out
his
bitterness
but
stopped
the
fight
and
rescued
the
exhausted
dares
saying
thus
in
soothing
words
what
height
of
madness
hath
seized
thy
mind
knowest
thou
not
the
strength
is
another
and
the
gods
are
changed
yield
thou
to
heaven
and
with
the
words
he
proclaimed
the
battle
over
but
him
his
faithful
mates
lead
to
the
ships
dragging
his
knees
feebly
swaying
his
head
from
side
to
side
and
spitting
from
his
mouth
clotted
blood
mingled
with
teeth
at
summons
they
bear
away
the
helmet
and
shield
and
leave
palm
and
bull
to
entellus
at
this
the
conqueror
swelling
in
pride
over
the
bull
cries
and
you
o
trojans
learn
thus
what
my
strength
of
body
was
in
its
prime
and
from
what
a
death
dares
is
saved
by
your
recall
he
spoke
and
stood
right
opposite
in
face
of
the
bullock
as
it
stood
by
the
prize
of
battle
then
drew
back
his
hand
and
swinging
the
hard
gauntlet
sheer
down
between
the
horns
smashed
the
bones
in
upon
the
shattered
brain
the
ox
rolls
over
and
quivering
and
lifeless
lies
along
the
ground
above
it
he
utters
these
deep
accents
life
eryx
i
give
to
thee
a
better
payment
than
death
here
i
lay
down
my
gloves
and
unconquered
skill
forthwith
aeneas
invites
all
that
will
to
the
contest
of
the
swift
arrow
and
proclaims
the
prizes
with
his
strong
hand
he
uprears
the
mast
of
serestus
ship
and
on
a
cord
crossing
it
hangs
from
the
masthead
a
fluttering
pigeon
as
mark
for
their
steel
they
gather
and
a
helmet
of
brass
takes
the
lots
as
they
throw
them
in
first
in
rank
and
before
them
all
amid
prosperous
cheers
comes
out
hippocoön
son
of
hyrtacus
and
mnestheus
follows
on
him
but
now
conqueror
in
the
ship
race
mnestheus
with
his
chaplet
of
green
olive
third
is
eurytion
thy
brother
o
pandarus
great
in
renown
thou
who
of
old
when
prompted
to
shatter
the
truce
didst
hurl
the
first
shaft
amid
the
achaeans
last
of
all
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
helmet
sank
acestes
he
too
venturing
to
set
hand
to
the
task
of
youth
then
each
and
all
they
strongly
bend
their
bows
into
a
curve
and
pull
shafts
from
their
quivers
and
first
the
arrow
of
the
son
of
hyrtacus
flying
through
heaven
from
the
sounding
string
whistles
through
the
fleet
breezes
and
reaches
and
sticks
fast
full
in
the
mast
wood
the
mast
quivered
and
the
bird
fluttered
her
feathers
in
affright
and
the
whole
ground
rang
with
loud
clapping
next
valiant
mnestheus
took
his
stand
with
bow
bent
aiming
high
with
levelled
eye
and
arrow
yet
could
not
unfortunate
hit
the
bird
herself
with
his
steel
but
cut
the
knotted
hempen
bands
that
tied
her
foot
as
she
hung
from
the
masthead
she
winged
her
flight
into
the
dark
windy
clouds
then
eurytion
who
ere
now
held
the
arrow
ready
on
his
bended
bow
swiftly
called
in
prayer
to
his
brother
marked
the
pigeon
as
she
now
went
down
the
empty
sky
exultant
on
clapping
wings
and
as
she
passed
under
a
dark
cloud
struck
her
she
fell
breathless
and
leaving
her
life
in
the
aery
firmament
slid
down
carrying
the
arrow
that
pierced
her
acestes
alone
was
over
and
the
prize
lost
yet
he
sped
his
arrow
up
into
the
air
to
display
his
lordly
skill
and
resounding
bow
at
this
a
sudden
sign
meets
their
eyes
mighty
in
augural
presage
as
the
high
event
taught
thereafter
and
in
late
days
boding
seers
prophesied
of
the
omen
for
the
flying
reed
blazed
out
amid
the
swimming
clouds
traced
its
path
in
flame
and
burned
away
on
the
light
winds
even
as
often
stars
shooting
from
their
sphere
draw
a
train
athwart
the
sky
trinacrians
and
trojans
hung
in
astonishment
praying
to
the
heavenly
powers
neither
did
great
aeneas
reject
the
omen
but
embraces
glad
acestes
and
loads
him
with
lavish
gifts
speaking
thus
my
lord
for
the
high
king
of
heaven
by
these
signs
hath
willed
thee
to
draw
the
lot
of
peculiar
honour
this
gift
shalt
thou
have
as
from
aged
anchises
own
hand
a
bowl
embossed
with
figures
that
once
cisseus
of
thrace
gave
my
father
anchises
to
bear
in
high
token
and
guerdon
of
affection
so
speaking
he
twines
green
bay
about
his
brows
and
proclaims
acestes
conqueror
first
before
them
all
nor
did
gentle
eurytion
though
he
alone
struck
the
bird
down
from
the
lofty
sky
grudge
him
to
be
preferred
in
honour
next
comes
for
his
prize
he
who
cut
the
cord
he
last
who
pierced
the
mast
with
his
winged
reed
but
lord
aeneas
ere
yet
the
contest
is
sped
calls
to
him
epytides
guardian
and
attendant
of
ungrown
iülus
and
thus
speaks
into
his
faithful
ear
and
away
and
tell
ascanius
if
he
now
holds
his
band
of
boys
ready
and
their
horses
arrayed
for
the
charge
to
defile
his
squadrons
to
his
grandsire
honour
in
bravery
of

so
says
he
and
himself
bids
all
the
crowding
throng
withdraw
from
the
long
racecourse
and
leave
the
lists
free
the
boys
move
in
before
their

glittering
in

turn
their

to
the

now
plight

once

say
the
labyrinth
in

a
tangled
path
between
blind

a
thousand
ways
of
doubling
treachery
where
tokens
to
follow
failed
in
the
maze
unmastered
and
irrecoverable
even
in
such
a
track
do
the
children
of
troy
entangle
their
footsteps
and
weave
the
game
of
flight
and
battle
like
dolphins
who
swimming
through
the
wet

cut
carpathian

this
fashion

girt

about

taught
their
celebration
to

latins
in

way
of

so
spoke
she
but
the
matrons
at
first
dubious
and
wavering
gazed
on
the
ships
with
malignant
eyes
between
the
wretched
longing
for
the
land
they
trod
and
the
fated
realm
that
summoned
them
when
the
goddess
rose
through
the
sky
on
poised
wings
and
in
her
flight
drew
a
vast
bow
beneath
the
clouds
then
indeed
amazed
at
the
tokens
and
driven
by
madness
they
raise
a
cry
and
snatch
fire
from
the
hearths
within
others
plunder
the
altars
and
cast
on
brushwood
boughs
and
brands
the
rages
with
loose
rein
over
thwarts
and
oars
and

of
painted
fir
eumelus
carries
the
news
of
the
burning
ships
to
the
grave
of
anchises
and
the
ranges
of
the
theatre
and
looking
back
their
own
eyes
see
the
floating
cloud
of
dark
ashes
and
in
a
moment
ascanius
as
he
rode
gaily
before
his
cavalry
spurred
his
horse
to
the
disordered
camp
nor
can
his
breathless
guardians
hold
him
back
strange
madness
is
this

cries
now
hasten
you
whither
alas
and
woe
o

not
on

nor
on
some
hostile
argive
camp
it

your

you
burn
behold
me
your
ascanius
and
he
flung
before
his
feet
the
empty
helmet
put
on
when
he
roused
the
mimicry
of
war
aeneas
and
the
trojan
train
together
hurry
to
the
spot
but
the
women
scatter
apart
in
fear
all
over
the
beach
and
stealthily
seek
the
woods
and
the
hollow
rocks
they
find
they
loathe
their
deed
and
the
daylight
and
with
changed
eyes
know
their
people
and
juno
is
startled
out
of
their
breast
but
not
thereby
do
the
flames
of
the
burning
lay
down
their
unconquered
strength
under
the
wet
oak
the
seams
are
alive
spouting
slow
coils
of
smoke
the
creeping
heat
devours
the
hulls
and
the
destroyer
takes
deep
hold
of
all
nor
does
the
heroes
strength
avail
nor
the
floods
they
pour
in
then
good
aeneas
rent
away
the
raiment
from
his
shoulders
and
called
the
gods
to
aid
stretching
forth
his
hands
omnipotent
if
thou
hatest
not
troy
yet
wholly
to
her
last
man
if
thine
ancient
pity
looks
at
all
on
human
woes
now
o
lord
grant
our
fleet
to
escape
the
flame
and
rescue
from
doom
the
slender
teucrian
estate
or
do
thou
plunge
to
death
this
remnant
if
i
deserve
it
with
levelled
thunderbolt
and
here
with
thine
own
hand
smite
us
down
scarce
had
he
uttered
this
when
a
black
tempest
rages
in
streaming
showers
earth
trembles
to
the
thunder
on
plain
and
steep
the
rushes
in
torrents
from
the
whole
heaven
amid
black
darkness
and
volleying
blasts
of
the
south
the
ships
are
filled
from
overhead
the
timbers
are
soaking
till
all
the
heat
is
quenched
and
all
the
hulls
but
four
that
are
lost
are
rescued
from
destruction
but
lord
aeneas
dismayed
by
the
bitter
mischance
revolved
at
heart
this
way
and
that
his
shifting
weight
of
care
whether
forgetting
fate
he
should
rest
in
sicilian
fields
or
reach
forth
to
the
borders
of
italy
then
old
nautes
whom
tritonian
pallas
taught
like
none
other
and
made
famous
in
eminence
of
art
she
granted
him
to
reply
what
the
gods
heavy
anger
menaced
or
what
the
order
of
fate
claimed
he
then
in
accents
of
comfort
thus
speaks
to
aeneas
follow
we
fate
ebb
and
flow
whatsoever
it
shall
be
fortune
must
be
borne
to
be
overcome
acestes
is
of
thine
own
divine
dardanian
race
take
him
for
he
is
willing
to
join
thee
in
common
counsel
deliver
to
him
those
who
are
over
now
these
ships
are
lost
and
those
who
are
quite
weary
of
thy
fortunes
and
the
great
quest
choose
out
the
old
men
stricken
in
years
and
the
matrons
sick
of
the
sea
and
all
that
is
weak
and
fearful
of
peril
in
thy
company
let
this
land
give
a
city
to
the
weary
they
shall
be
allowed
to
call
their
town
acesta
by
name
then
indeed
kindled
by
these
words
of
his
aged
friend
his
spirit
is
distracted
among
all
his
cares
and
now
black
night
rose
and
held
the
sky
when
the
likeness
of
his
father
anchises
seemed
to
descend
from
heaven
and
suddenly
utter
thus
son
more
dear
to
me
than
life
once
of
old
while
life
was
yet
mine
o

hard
wrought
by

of

drove
the

from

at

thou
the
fair
counsel
aged

now
gives

through

thy

neither

fate
itself
break

it
is
not

that
her
accursed
hatred
hath
devoured
the

and
exhausted
on
it
the

vengeance
still
she
pursues
this

the

of

troy
i
pray
she
know
why
her
passion
is
so
fierce
thyself
art
my

what
a
sudden

she
raised
of
late
on
the

waters
flinging
all
the

to

in
vain
reliance
on

blasts
this
she
dared
in

lo
too
driving
the
trojan
matrons
into
guilt
she
hath
foully
burned
their
ships
and
forced
them
their

lost
to
leave
the

to
an
unknown

let
the
remnant
i
beseech
thee
give
their
sails
to
thy
safe
keeping
across
the

let
them
reach

if
i
ask
what

grants
them
a

there
then
the

thus
is
wholly
right

many
thousands
to

when
the
choked
rivers
groaned
and
xanthus
could
not
find

or
roll
out
to

then
i
snatched

away
in

as
he
met
the

thus

to

and
the

calls
the

into

a

scooped
in
the

of

whither

by
an

whence
peal
forth
as

the

of

they
had
reached

when
the
maiden
cries
is

lo
the

even
as

spoke
thus
in

suddenly

nor

stayed
the

her

heart
heaves
madly
in
her
panting
bosom
and
she
expands
to

and
her
voice
is
more
than
mortal
now
the

breathes
on

she

lingerest
thou

then
will
the

spellbound
house
swing
open
so
spoke
she
and
sank
to
silence
a
cold
shiver
ran
through
the
teucrians
iron
frames
and
the
king
pours
supplication
who
hast
ever
pitied
the
sore
travail
of
troy
who
didst
guide
the
dardanian
shaft
from

full

pierced

thus
far
let
the

follow
us
you
too
may
now
unforbidden
spare
the

claim
a

then
will
i
ordain

a

of
solid
marble
and
festal
days
in

thee
likewise
a

i

his

but
the
prophetess
not

rages
fiercely
in

the

open
the
consecrated

him
on
these
shoulders
i
rescued
from
encircling
flames
and
a
thousand
pursuing
weapons
and
brought
him
safe
from
amid
the
enemy
he
accompanied
my
way
over
all
the

and
bore
with
me
all
the
threats
of
ocean
and
sky
in
weakness
beyond
his
age
strength
and
due
nay
he
it
was
who
besought
and
enjoined
me
to
seek
thy
grace
and
draw
nigh
thy
courts
have
pity
i
beseech
thee
on
son
and
father
o
gracious
one
for
thou
art
nor
in
vain
hath
hecate
given
thee
rule
in
the

could
call
up
his

in

why

i
too
am
of

in
such
words
he
pleaded
and
clasped
the
altars
when
the
soothsayer
thus
began
to
speak
sprung
of

blood
child
of
anchises
of
troy
easy
is
the
descent
into
hell
all
night
and
day
the
gate
of
dark
dis
stands
open
but
to
recall
thy
steps
and
issue
to
upper
air
this
is
the
task
and
burden
some
few
of
gods
lineage
have
availed
such
as
jupiter
gracious
favour
or
virtue
ardour
hath
upborne
to
heaven
midway
all
is
muffled
in
forest
and
the
black
coils
of
cocytus
circle
it
round
yet
if
thy
soul
is
so
passionate
and
so
desirous
twice
to
float
across
the
stygian
lake
twice
to
see
dark
tartarus
and
thy
pleasure
is
to
plunge
into
the
mad
task
learn
what
must
first
be
accomplished
hidden
in
a
shady
tree
is
a
bough
with
leafage
and
pliant
shoot
all
of
gold
consecrate
to
nether
juno
wrapped
in
the
depth
of
woodland
and
shut
in
by
dim
dusky
vales
but
to
him
only
who
first
hath
plucked
the
fruitage
from
the
tree
is
it
given
to
enter
the
hidden
places
of
the
earth
this
hath
beautiful
proserpine
ordained
to
be
borne
to
her
for
her
proper
gift
the
first
torn
away
a
second
fills
the
place
in
gold
and
the
spray
burgeons
with
even
such
ore
again
so
let
thine
eyes
trace
it
home
and
thine
hand
pluck
it
duly
when
found
for
lightly
and
unreluctant
will
it
follow
if
thine
is
fate
summons
else
will
no
strength
of
thine
avail
to
conquer
it
nor
hard
steel
to
cut
it
away
yet
again
a
friend
of
thine
lies
a
lifeless
corpse
alas
thou
knowest
it
not
and
defiles
all
the
fleet
with
death
while
thou
seekest
our
counsel
and
lingerest
in
our
courts
first
lay
him
in
his
and
hide
him
in
the
tomb
lead
thither
black
cattle
be
this
first
thine
expiation
so
at
last
shalt
thou
behold
the
stygian
groves
and
the
realm
untrodden
of
the
living
she
spoke
and
her
lips
shut
to
silence
aeneas
goes
forth
and
leaves
the
cavern
with
fixed
eyes
and
sad
countenance
his
soul
revolving
inly
the
unseen
issues
by
his
side
goes
faithful
achates
and
plants
his
footsteps
in
equal
perplexity
long
they
ran
on
in
mutual
change
of
talk
of
what
lifeless
comrade
spoke
the
soothsayer
of
what
body
for
burial
and
even
as
they
came
they
see
on
the
dry
beach
misenus
cut
off
by
untimely
death
misenus
the
aeolid
excelled
of
none
other
in
stirring
men
with
brazen
breath
and
kindling
battle
with
his
he
had
been
attendant
on
mighty
hector
in
hector
train
he
waged
battle
renowned
alike
for
bugle
and
spear
after
victorious
achilles
robbed
him
of
life
the
valiant
hero
had
joined
dardanian
aeneas
company
and
followed
no
meaner
leader
but
now
while
he
makes
his
hollow
shell
echo
over
the
seas
ah
fool
and
calls
the
gods
to
rival
his
blast
jealous
triton
if
belief
is
due
had
caught
him
among
the
rocks
and
sunk
him
in
the
foaming
waves
so
all
surrounded
him
with
loud
murmur
and
cries
good
aeneas
the
foremost
then
weeping
they
quickly
hasten
on
the
orders
and
work
hard
to
pile
trees
for
the
altar
of
burial
and
heap
it
up
into
the
sky
they
move
into
the
ancient
forest
the
deep
coverts
of
game
fall
flat
ilex
rings
to
the
stroke
of
axes
and
ashen
beams
and
oak
are
split
in
clefts
with
wedges
they
roll
in
huge
from
the
hills
aeneas
likewise
is
first
in
the
work
and
cheers
on
his
crew
and
arms
himself
with
their
weapons
and
alone
with
his
sad
heart
he
ponders
it
all
gazing
on
the
endless
forest
and
utters
this
prayer
but
now
that
bough
of
gold
would
shew
itself
to
us
on
the
tree
in
this
depth
of
woodland
since
all
the
tale
of
thee
misenus
was
alas
too
truly
spoken
scarcely
had
he
said
thus
when
twin
doves
haply
came
flying
down
the
sky
and
lit
on
the
green
sod
right
under
his
eyes
then
the
kingly
hero
knows
them
for
his
mother
birds
and
joyfully
prays
be
my
guides
if
way
there
be
and
direct
your
aëry
passage
into
the
groves
where
the
rich
bough
overshadows
the
fertile
ground
and
thou
o
goddess
mother
fail
not
our
wavering
fortune
so
spoke
he
and
stayed
his
steps
marking
what
they
signify
whither
they
urge
their
way
feeding
and
flying
they
advance
at
such
distance
as
following
eyes
could
keep
them
in
view
then
when
they
came
to
avernus
pestilent
gorge
they
tower
swiftly
and
sliding
down
through
the
liquid
air
choose
their
seat
and
light
side
by
side
on
a
tree
through
whose
boughs
shone
out
the
contrasting
flicker
of
gold
as
in
chill
the
woodland
is
wont
to
blossom
with
the
strange
leafage
of
the
mistletoe
sown
on
an
alien
tree
and
wreathing
the
smooth
stems
with
burgeoning
saffron
so
on
the
shadowy
ilex
seemed
that
leafy
gold
so
the
foil
tinkled
in
the
light
breeze
immediately
aeneas
seizes
it
and
eagerly
breaks
off
its
resistance
and
carries
it
beneath
the
sibyl
roof
and
therewithal
the
teucrians
on
the
beach
wept
misenus
and
bore
the
last
rites
to
the
thankless
ashes
first
they
build
up
a
vast
pyre
of
resinous
billets
and
sawn
oak
whose
sides
they
entwine
with
dark
leaves
and
plant
funereal
cypresses
in
front
and
adorn
it
above
with
his
shining
armour
some
prepare
warm
water
in
cauldrons
bubbling
over
the
flames
and
wash
and
anoint
the
chill
body
and
make
their
moan
then
their
weeping
done
lay
his
limbs
on
the
pillow
and
spread
over
it
crimson
raiment
the
accustomed
pall
some
uplift
the
heavy
bier
a
melancholy
service
and
with
averted
faces
in
their
ancestral
fashion
hold
and
thrust
in
the
torch
gifts
of
frankincense
food
and
bowls
of
olive
oil
are
poured
and
piled
upon
the
fire
after
the
embers
sank
in
and
the
flame
died
away
they
soaked
with
wine
the
remnant
of
thirsty
ashes
and
corynaeus
gathered
the
bones
and
shut
them
in
an
urn
of
brass
and
he
too
thrice
encircled
his
comrades
with
fresh
water
and
cleansed
them
with
light
spray
sprinkled
from
a
bough
of
fruitful
olive
and
spoke
the
last
words
of
all
but
good
aeneas
heaps
a
mighty
mounded
tomb
over
him
with
his
own
armour
and
his
oar
and
trumpet
beneath
a
skyey
mountain
that
now
is
called
misenus
after
him
and
keeps
his
name
immortal
from
age
to
age
this
done
he
hastens
to
fulfil
the
sibyl
ordinance
a
deep
cave
yawned
dreary
and
vast
sheltered
by
the
black
lake
and
the
gloom
of
the
forests
over
it
no
flying
things
could
wing
their
way
unharmed
such
a
vapour
streamed
from
the
dark
gorge
and
rose
into
the
overarching
sky
here
the
priestess
first
arrays
four
bullocks
and
pours
wine
upon
their
forehead
and
plucking
the
topmost
hairs
from
between
the
horns
lays
them
on
the
sacred
fire
for
calling
aloud
on
hecate
mistress
of
heaven
and
hell
others
lay
knives
beneath
and
catch
the
warm
blood
in
cups
aeneas
himself
smites
with
the
sword
a
to
the
mother
of
the
eumenides
and
her
mighty
sister
and
a
barren
heifer
proserpine
to
thee
then
he
uprears
darkling
altars
to
the
stygian
king
and
lays
whole
carcases
of
bulls
upon
the
flames
pouring
fat
oil
over
the
blazing
entrails
and
lo
about
the
first
rays
of
sunrise
the
ground
moaned
underfoot
and
the
woodland
ridges
began
to
stir
and
dogs
seemed
to
howl
through
the
dusk
as
the
goddess
came
ah
keep
apart
o
ye
unsanctified
cries
the
soothsayer
from
all
the
grove
and
thou
stride
on
and
unsheath
thy
steel
now
is
need
of
courage
o
aeneas
now
of
strong
resolve
so
much
she
spoke
and
plunged
madly
into
the
cavern
opening

with
unflinching
steps
keeps

with

advancing

are

so
let
me
tell
and
according
to
your
will
unfold
things
sunken
deep
under

in
gloom
they
went
darkling
through
the
dusk
beneath
the
solitary
night
through
the
empty
dwellings
and
bodiless
realm
of
dis

the

guilty

and
war
full
in
the

and
the

in
their
iron

discord
with
bloodstained
fillets
enwreathing
her
serpent
locks
midway
an
elm
shadowy
and
high
spreads
her
boughs
and

arms
where

saith

monstrous
creatures

hundredfold
briareus
and
the
beast
of

hissing
horribly
and
the
chimaera
armed
with
flame
gorgons
and
harpies
and
the
body
of
the
triform
shade
here
aeneas
snatches
at
his
sword
in
a
sudden
flutter
of
terror
and
turns
the
naked
edge
on
them
as
they
come
and
did
not
his
wise
remind
him
that
these
lives
flit
thin
and
unessential
in
the
hollow
mask
of
body
he
would
rush
on
and
vainly
lash
through
phantoms
with
his
steel
hence
a

leads
to

here
the
dreary
pool
swirls
thick
in

disgorges
into

the

these

ragged
and
awful
his

with
untrimmed
masses
of

plies

of

but
a

to

from

when
the

of

routs
them

them
to

lands

stood
pleading
for
the
first
passage
across

stretched
forth
passionate

to
the
farther

the
grim
sailor
admits
now

and

another
while

he
pushes
back
far
apart
on

moved
with
marvel
at
the
confused

o

aeneas

this
flocking

thou

by

ere
the

sorely
desired
anchises
son
stood
still
and
ponderingly
stayed
his
footsteps
pitying
at
heart
their
cruel
lot
there
he
discerns
mournful
and
unhonoured
dead
leucaspis
and
orontes
captains
of
the
lycian
squadron
whom
as
they
sailed
together
from
troy
over
gusty
seas
the
south
wind
overwhelmed
and
wrapped
the
waters
round
ship
and
men
lo
there
went
by
palinurus
the
steersman
who
of
late
while
he
watched
the
stars
on
their
libyan
passage
had
slipped
from
the
stern
and
fallen
amid
the
waves
to
him
when
he
first
knew
the
melancholy
form
in
that
depth
of
shade
he
thus
opens
speech
god
o
palinurus
reft
thee
from
us
and
sank
thee
amid
the
seas
forth
and
tell
for
in
this
single
answer
apollo
deceived
me
never
found
false
before
when
he
prophesied
thee
safety
on
ocean
and
arrival
on
the
ausonian
coasts
see
is
this
his
and
he
did
phoebus
on
his
oracular
seat
delude
thee
o
prince
anchises
son
nor
did
any
god
drown
me
in
the
sea
for
while
i
clung
to
my
appointed
charge
and
governed
our
course
i
pulled
the
tiller
with
me
in
my
fall
and
the
shock
as
i
slipped
wrenched
it
away
by
the
rough
seas
i
swear
fear
for
myself
never
wrung
me
so
sore
as
for
thy
ship
lest
the
rudder
lost
and
the
pilot
struck
away
those
gathering
waves
might
master
it
three
wintry
nights
in
the
water
the
blustering
south
drove
me
over
the
endless
sea
scarcely
on
the
fourth
dawn
i
descried
italy
as
i
rose
on
the
climbing
wave
little
by
little
i
swam
shoreward
already
i
clung
safe
but
while
encumbered
with
my
dripping
raiment
i
caught
with
crooked
fingers
at
the
jagged
needles
of
mountain
rock
the
barbarous
people
attacked
me
in
arms
and
ignorantly
deemed
me
a
prize
now
the
wave
holds
me
and
the
winds
toss
me
on
the
shore
by
pleasant
light
and
breezes
i
beseech
thee
by
thy
father
by
iülus
thy
rising
hope
rescue
me
from
these
distresses
o
unconquered
one
either
do
thou
for
thou
canst
cast
earth
over
me
and
again
seek
the
haven
of
velia
or
do
thou
if
in
any
wise
that
may
be
if
in
any
wise
the
goddess
who
bore
thee
shews
a
way
for
not
without
divine
will
do
i
deem
thou
wilt
float
across
these
vast
rivers
and
the
stygian
pool
lend
me
a
pitying
hand
and
bear
me
over
the
waves
in
thy
company
that
at
least
in
death
i
may
find
a
quiet
thus
he
ended
and
the
soothsayer
thus
began
o
palinurus
this
fierce
longing
of
thine
shalt
thou
without
burial
behold
the
stygian
waters
and
the
awful
river
of
the
furies
cease
to
hope
prayers
may
bend
the
decrees
of
heaven
but
take
my
words
to
thy
memory
for
comfort
in
thy
woeful
case
far
and
wide
shall
the
bordering
cities
be
driven
by
celestial
portents
to
appease
thy
dust
they
shall
rear
a
tomb
and
pay
the
tomb
a
yearly
offering
and
for
evermore
shall
the
place
keep
palinurus
name
the
words
soothed
away
his
distress
and
for
a
while
drove
grief
away
from
his
sorrowing
heart
he
is
glad
in
the
land
of
his
name
so
they
complete
their
journey
beginning
and
draw
nigh
the
river
just
then
the
waterman
descried
them
from
the
stygian
wave
advancing
through
the
silent
woodland
and
turning
their
feet
towards
the
bank
and
opens
on
them
in
these
words
of
challenge
thou
art
who
marchest
in
arms
towards
our
river
forth
and
say
there
as
thou
art
why
thou
comest
and
stay
thine
advance
this
is
the
land
of
shadows
of
sleep
and
slumberous
night
no
living
body
may
the
stygian
hull
convey
nor
truly
had
i
joy
of
taking
alcides
on
the
lake
for
passenger
nor
theseus
and
pirithoüs
born
of
gods
though
they
were
and
unconquered
in
might
he
laid

the

stirs
thee
in

this

the

his

its

he

no

marvelling
at
the
awful
gift
the
fated
rod
so
long
unseen
he
steers
in
his
dusky
vessel
and
draws
to
shore
next
he
routs
out
the
souls
that
sate
on

long
benches
and
clears
the
thwarts

he
takes

unscathed
on

with
the
baying
of

couched
huge
in
the
cavern
opposite
to

the
prophetess
seeing
the
serpents
already
bristling
up
on
his
neck
throws
a
cake
made
slumberous
with
honey
and
drugged
grain
he
with
threefold
jaws
gaping
in
ravenous
hunger
catches
it
when
thrown

sinks
to

with

outstretched
and
sprawling

over

his

the

overwhelmed

makes
entrance
and
quickly
issues
from

of

irremeable

immediately
wailing
voices
are
loud
in
their
ears
the
souls
of
babies
crying
on
the
doorway
sill
whom
torn
from
the
breast
and
portionless
in
life
sweetness
a
dark
day
cut
off
and
drowned
in
bitter
death
hard
by
them
are
those
condemned
to
death
on
false
accusation
neither
indeed
are

assigned
without

minos
presides
and
shakes
the
urn
he
summons
a
council
of
the
silent
people
and
inquires
of
their
lives
and
charges
next
in
order
have
these
mourners
their
place
whose
own
innocent
hands
dealt
them
death
who
flung
away
their
souls
in
hatred
of
the
day
how
fain
were
they
now
in
upper
air
to
endure
their
poverty
and
sore
travail
it
may
not
be
the
unlovely

ninefold
barrier
between

not

from
here
are
shewn
stretching
on
every
side
the
wailing
fields
so
they
call
them
by

here
they
whom
pitiless
love
hath
wasted
in
cruel
decay
hide
among
untrodden
ways
shrouded
in
embosoming
myrtle
thickets
not
death
itself
ends
their
distresses
in
this
region
he
discerns
phaedra
and
procris
and
woeful
eriphyle
shewing
on
her
the
wounds
of
her
merciless
son
and
evadne
and
pasiphaë
laodamia
goes
in
their
company
and
she
who
was
once
caeneus
and
a
man
now
woman
and
again
returned
by
fate
into
her
shape
of
old
among
whom
dido
the
phoenician
fresh
from
her
wandered
in
the
vast
forest
by
her
the
trojan
hero
stood
and
knew
the
dim
form
through
the
darkness
even
as
the
moon
at
the
month
beginning
to
him
who
sees
or
thinks
he
sees
her
rising
through
the
vapours
he
let
tears
fall
and
spoke
to
her
lovingly
and
sweet
dido
so
the
news
was
true
that
reached
me
thou
didst
perish
and
the
sword
sealed
thy
doom
ah
me
was
i
cause
of
thy
death
by
the
stars
i
swear
by
the
heavenly
powers
and
all
that
is
sacred
beneath
the
earth
unwillingly
o
queen
i
left
thy
shore
but
the
gods
at
whose
orders
now
i
pass
through
this
shadowy
place
this
land
of
mouldering
overgrowth
and
deep
night
the
gods
commands
drove
me
forth
nor
could
i
deem
my
departure
would
bring
thee
pain
so
great
as
this
stay
thy
footstep
and
withdraw
not
from
our
gaze
from
whom
fliest
thou
the
last
speech
of
thee
fate
ordains
me
is
this
in
such
words
and
with
starting
tears
aeneas
soothed
the
burning
and
soul
she
turned
away
with
looks
fixed
fast
on
the
ground
stirred
no
more
in
countenance
by
the
speech
he
essays
than
if
she
stood
in
iron
flint
or
marpesian
stone
at
length
she
started
and
fled
wrathfully
into
the
shadowy
woodland
where
sychaeus
her
ancient
husband
responds
to
her
distresses
and
equals
her
affection
yet
aeneas
dismayed
by
her
cruel
doom
follows
her
far
on
her
way
with
pitying
tears
thence
he
pursues
his
appointed
path
and
now
they
trod
those
utmost
fields
where
the
renowned
in
war
have
their
haunt
apart
here
tydeus
meets
him
here
parthenopaeus
glorious
in
arms
and
the
pallid
phantom
of
adrastus
here
the
dardanians
long
wept
on
earth
and
fallen
in
the
war
sighing
he
discerns
all
their
long
array
glaucus
and
medon
and
thersilochus
the
three
children
of
antenor
and
polyphoetes
priest
and
idaeus
yet
charioted
yet
grasping
his
arms
the
souls
throng
round
him
to
right
and
left
nor
is
one
look
enough
lingering
delighted
they
pace
by
his
side
and
enquire
wherefore
he
is
come
but
the
princes
of
the
grecians
and
agamemnon
armies
when
they
see
him
glittering
in
arms
through
the
gloom
hurry
away
some
turn
backward
as
when
of
old
they
fled
to
the
ships
some
raise
their
voice
faintly
and
gasp
out
a
broken
ineffectual
cry
and
here
he
saw
deïphobus
son
of
priam
with
face
cruelly
torn
face
and
both
hands
and
ears
lopped
from
his
mangled
temples
and
nostrils
maimed
by
a
shameful
wound
barely
he
knew
the
cowering
form
that
hid
its
dreadful
punishment
then
he
springs
to
accost
it
in
familiar
speech
mighty
in
arms
seed
of
teucer
royal
blood
whose
wantonness
of
vengeance
was
so
cruel
who
was
allowed
to
use
thee
thus
rumour
reached
me
that
on
that
last
night
outwearied
with
endless
slaughter
thou
hadst
sunk
on
the
heap
of
mingled
carnage
then
mine
own
hand
reared
an
empty
tomb
on
the
rhoetean
shore
mine
own
voice
thrice
called
aloud
upon
thy
ghost
thy
name
and
armour
keep
the
spot
thee
o
my
friend
i
could
not
see
nor
lay
in
the
native
earth
i
left
whereto
the
son
of
priam
nothing
o
my
friend
wert
thou
wanting
thou
hast
paid
the
full
to
deïphobus
and
the
dead
man
shade
but
me
my
fate
and
the
laconian
woman
murderous
guilt
thus
dragged
down
to
doom
these
are
the
records
of
her
leaving
for
how
we
spent
that
last
night
in
delusive
gladness
thou
knowest
and
must
needs
remember
too
well
when
the
fated
horse
leapt
down
on
the
steep
towers
of
troy
bearing
armed
infantry
for
the
burden
of
its
womb
she
in
feigned
procession
led
round
our
phrygian
women
with
bacchic
cries
herself
she
upreared
a
mighty
flame
amid
them
and
called
the
grecians
out
of
the
fortress
height
then
was
i
fast
in
mine
bridal
chamber
deep
asleep
and
outworn
with
my
charge
and
lay
overwhelmed
in
slumber
sweet
and
profound
and
most
like
to
easeful
death
meanwhile
that
crown
of
wives
removes
all
the
arms
from
my
dwelling
and
slips
out
the
faithful
sword
from
beneath
my
head
she
calls
menelaus
into
the
house
and
flings
wide
the
gateway
be
sure
she
hoped
her
lover
would
magnify
the
gift
and
so
she
might
quench
the
fame
of
her
ill
deeds
of
old
why
do
i
linger
they
burst
into
the
chamber
they
and
the
aeolid
counsellor
of
crime
in
their
company
gods
recompense
the
greeks
even
thus
if
with
righteous
lips
i
call
for
vengeance
but
come
tell
in
turn
what
hap
hath
brought
thee
hither
yet
alive
comest
thou
driven
on
ocean
wanderings
or
by
promptings
from
heaven
or
what
fortune
keeps
thee
from
rest
that
thou
shouldst
draw
nigh
these
sad
sunless
dwellings
this
disordered
land
in
this
change
of
talk
dawn
had
already
crossed
heaven
mid
axle
on
her
way
and
haply
had
they
thus
drawn
out
all
the
allotted
time
but
the
sibyl
made
brief
warning
speech
to
her
companion
falls
aeneas
we
waste
the
hours
in
weeping
here
is
the
place
where
the
road
disparts
by
this
that
runs
to
the
right
under
great
dis
city
is
our
path
to
elysium
but
the
leftward
wreaks
vengeance
on
the
wicked
and
sends
them
to
unrelenting
hell
but
deïphobus
not
angered
mighty
priestess
i
will
depart
i
will
refill
my
place
and
return
into
darkness
go
glory
of
our
people
go
enjoy
a
fairer
fate
than
mine
thus
much
he
spoke
and
on
the
word
turned
away
his
footsteps
aeneas
looks
swiftly
back
and
sees
beneath
the
cliff
on
the
left
hand
a
wide
city
girt
with
a
triple
wall
and
encircled
by
a
racing
river

that
echoes
over

in

pillared
with

that
no

force
of

nor
the

may
avail
to
overthrow
it
stands
up
a

of
iron
and
tisiphone
sitting
girt
in
bloodstained
pall
keeps
sleepless
watch
at
the
entry
by
night
and
day
hence
moans
are
heard
and
fierce
lashes
resound
with
the
clank
of
iron
and
dragging
chains
aeneas
stopped
and
hung
dismayed
at
the
tumult
shapes
of
crime
are
here
declare
o
maiden
or
what
the
punishment
that
pursues
them
and
all
this
upsurging
wail
then
the
soothsayer
thus
began
to
speak
chief
of
troy
no
pure
foot
may
tread
these
guilty
courts
but
to
me
hecate
herself
when
she
gave
me
rule
over

how
the

punish
and
guided
me
through
all
her

wheresoever
in

till

evil
he
wrought
straightway

tisiphone
girt
with
her
scourge
tramples
down
the
shivering
sinners
menaces
them
with
the
grim
snakes
in
her
left
hand
and
summons
forth
her
sisters
in
merciless
train
then
at
last
the
sacred
gates
are
flung
open
and
grate
on
the
jarring
hinge
markest
thou
what

is
seated
in

the
threshold
more

within
sits
the
monstrous

with
her
fifty

essayed
with

to
pluck
down

borne
by

horses
and
brandishing
a

he
rode
in
triumph
midway
through
the
populous
city
of
grecian

claimed
for
himself
the
worship
of

madman
who
would
mimic
the
and
the
inimitable
bolt
with
brass
that
rang
under
his
trampling
but
the
lord
omnipotent
hurled
his
shaft
through
thickening
clouds
no
firebrand
his
nor
smoky
glare
of
torches
and
dashed
him
headlong
in

fury

therewithal

gracious
what
region
what
place
hath
anchises
for
his
own
for
his
sake
are
we
come
and
have
sailed
across
the
wide
rivers
of
erebus
and
to
her
the
hero
thus
made
brief
reply
hath
a
fixed
dwelling
we
live
in
the
shady
woodlands
banks
and
meadows
fresh
with
streams
are
our
habitation
but
you
if
this
be
your
desire
scale
this
ridge
and
i
will
even
now
set
you
on
an
easy
pathway
he
spoke
and
paced
on
before
them
and
from
above
shews
the
shining
plains
thereafter
they
leave
the
mountain
heights
but
lord
anchises
deep
in
the
green
valley
was
musing
in
earnest
survey
over
the
imprisoned
souls
destined
to
the
daylight
above
and
haply
reviewing
his
beloved
children
and
all
the
tale
of
his
people
them
and
their
fates
and
fortunes
their
works
and
ways
and
he
when
he
saw
aeneas
advancing
to
meet
him
over
the
greensward
stretched
forth
both
hands
eagerly
while
tears
rolled
over
his
cheeks
and
his
lips
parted
in
a
cry
thou
come
at
last
and
hath
thy
love
o
child
of
my
desire
conquered
the
difficult
road
is
it
granted
o
my
son
to
gaze
on
thy
face
and
hear
and
answer
in
familiar
tones
thus
indeed
i
forecast
in
spirit
counting
the
days
between
nor
hath
my
care
misled
me
what
lands
what
space
of
seas
hast
thou
traversed
to
reach
me
through
what
surge
of
perils
o
my
son
how
i
dreaded
the
realm
of
libya
might
work
thee
harm
and
he
melancholy
phantom
thine
o
my
father
came
before
me
often
and
often
and
drove
me
to
steer
to
these
portals
my
fleet
is
anchored
on
the
tyrrhenian
brine
give
thine
hand
to
clasp
o
my
father
give
it
and
withdraw
not
from
our
embrace
so
spoke
he
his
face
wet
with
abundant
weeping
thrice
there
did
he
essay
to
fling
his
arms
about
his
neck
thrice
the
phantom
vainly
grasped
fled
out
of
his
hands
even
as
light
wind
and
most
like
to
fluttering
sleep
meanwhile
aeneas
sees
deep
withdrawn
in
the
covert
of
the
vale
a
woodland
and
rustling
forest
thickets
and
the
river
of
lethe
that
floats
past
their
peaceful
dwellings
around
it
flitted
nations
and
peoples
innumerable
even
as
in
the
meadows
when
in
clear
summer
weather
bees
settle
on
the
variegated
flowers
and
stream
round
the
lilies
all
the
plain
is
murmurous
with
their
humming
aeneas
starts
at
the
sudden
view
and
asks
the
reason
he
knows
not
what
are
those
spreading
streams
or
who
are
they
whose
vast
train
fills
the
banks
then
lord
anchises
for
whom
second
bodies
are
destined
and
due
drink
at
the
wave
of
the
lethean
stream
the
heedless
water
of
long
forgetfulness
these
of
a
truth
have
i
long
desired
to
tell
and
shew
thee
face
to
face
and
number
all
the
generation
of
thy
children
that
so
thou
mayest
the
more
rejoice
with
me
in
finding
italy
father
must
we
think
that
any
souls
travel
hence
into
upper
air
and
return
again
to
bodily
fetters
why
this
their
strange
sad
longing
for
the
light
will
tell
rejoins
anchises
will
i
hold
thee
in
suspense
my
son
and
he
unfolds
all
things
in
order
one
by
one
of
all
heaven
and
earth
and
the
liquid
fields
the
shining
orb
of
the
moon
and
the
titanian
star
doth
a
spirit
sustain
inly
and
a
soul
shed
abroad
in
them
sways
all
their
members
and
mingles
in
the
mighty
frame
thence
is
the
generation
of
man
and
beast
the
life
of
winged
things
and
the
monstrous
forms
that
ocean
breeds
under
his
glittering
floor
those
seeds
have
fiery
force
and
divine
birth
so
far
as
they
are
not
clogged
by
taint
of
the
body
and
dulled
by
earthy
frames
and
limbs
ready
to
die
hence
is
it
they
fear
and
desire
sorrow
and
rejoice
nor
can
they
pierce
the
air
while
barred
in
the
blind
darkness
of
their
nay
and
when
the
last
ray
of
life
is
gone
not
yet
alas
does
all
their
woe
nor
do
all
the
plagues
of
the
body
wholly
leave
them
free
and
needs
must
be
that
many
a
long
ingrained
evil
should
take
root
marvellously
deep
therefore
they
are
schooled
in
punishment
and
pay
all
the
forfeit
of
a
lifelong
ill
some
are
hung
stretched
to
the
viewless
winds
some
have
the
taint
of
guilt
washed
out
beneath
the
dreary
deep
or
burned
away
in
fire
we
suffer
each
a
several
ghost
thereafter
we
are
sent
to
the
broad
spaces
of
elysium
some
few
of
us
to
possess
the
happy
fields
till
length
of
days
completing
time
circle
takes
out
the
ingrained
soilure
and
leaves
untainted
the
ethereal
sense
and
pure
spiritual
flame
all
these
before
thee
when
the
wheel
of
a
thousand
years
hath
come
fully
round
a
god
summons
in
vast
train
to
the
river
of
lethe
that
so
they
may
regain
in
forgetfulness
the
slopes
of
upper
earth
and
begin
to
desire
to
return
again
into
the
body
anchises
ceased
and
leads
his
son
and
the
sibyl
likewise
amid
the
assembled
murmurous
throng
and
mounts
a
hillock
whence
he
might
scan
all
the
long
ranks
and
learn
their
countenances

as

so
pursues
how
marcellus
the

marches

in
the
splendid

towering

above

all

shall
stay
the

and
a

hang
up
the
captured

before
lord
quirinus
and
at
this
aeneas
for
he
saw
going
by
his
side
one
excellent
in
beauty
and
glittering
in
arms
but
his
brow
had
little
cheer
and
his
eyes
looked
down
o
my
father
is
he
who
thus
attends
him
on
his
way
son
or
other
of
his
children
princely
race
how
his
comrades
murmur
around
him
how
goodly
of
presence
he
is
but
dark
night
flutters
round
his
head
with
melancholy
shade
then
lord
anchises
with
welling
tears
began
my
son
ask
not
of
the
great
sorrow
of
thy
people
him
shall
fate
but
shew
to
earth
and
suffer
not
to
stay
further
too
mighty
lords
of
heaven
did
you
deem
the
brood
of
rome
had
this
your
gift
been
abiding
what
moaning
of
men
shall
arise
from
the
field
of
mavors
by
the
imperial
city
what
a
funeral
train
shalt
thou
see
o
tiber
as
thou
flowest
by
the
grave
neither
shall
the
boyhood
of
any
of
ilian
race
raise
his
latin
forefathers
hope
so
high
nor
shall
the
land
of
romulus
ever
boast
of
any
fosterling
like
this
alas
his
goodness
alas
his
antique
honour
and
right
hand
invincible
in
war
none
had
faced
him
unscathed
in
armed
shock
whether
he
met
the
foe
on
foot
or
ran
his
spurs
into
the
flanks
of
his
foaming
horse
ah
me
the
pity
of
thee
o
boy
if
in
any
wise
thou
breakest
the
grim
bar
of
fate
thou
shalt
be
marcellus
give
me
lilies
in
full
hands
let
me
strew
bright
blossoms
and
these
gifts
at
least
let
me
lavish
on
my
descendant
soul
and
do
the
unavailing
service
thus
they
wander
up
and
down
over
the
whole
region
of
broad
vaporous
plains
and
scan
all
the
scene
and
when
anchises
had
led
his
son
over
it
each
point
by
each
and
kindled
his
spirit
with
passion
for
the
glories
on
their
way
he
tells
him
thereafter
of
the
war
he
next
must
wage
and
instructs
him
of
the
laurentine
peoples
and
the
city
of
latinus
and
in
what
wise
each
task
may
be
turned
aside
or
borne
there
are
twin
portals
of
sleep
whereof
the
one
is
fabled
of
horn
and
by
it
real
shadows
are
given
easy
outlet
the
other
shining
white
of
polished
ivory
but
false
visions
issue
upward
from
the
ghostly
world
with
these
words
then
anchises
follows
forth
his
son
and
the
sibyl
together
there
and
dismisses
them
by
the
ivory
gate
he
pursues
his
way
to
the
ships
and
revisits
his
comrades
then
bears
on
to
caieta
haven
straight
along
the
shore
the
anchor
is
cast
from
the
prow
the
sterns
are
grounded
on

book

thou
also
caieta
nurse
of

gavest
our
shores
an
everlasting
renown
in
death
and
still
thine
honour
haunts
thy
and
a
name
in
broad
hesperia
if
that
be
glory
marks
thy
dust
but
when
the
last
rites
are
duly
paid
and
the
mound
smoothed
over
the
grave
good
aeneas
now
the
high
seas
are
hushed
bears
on
under
sail
and
leaves
his
haven
breezes
blow
into
the
night
and
the
white
moonshine
speeds
them
on
the
sea
glitters
in
her
quivering
radiance
soon
they
skirt
the
shores
of
circe
land
where
the
rich
daughter
of
the
sun
makes
her
untrodden
groves
echo
with
ceaseless
song
and
her
stately
house
glows
nightlong
with
burning
odorous
cedarwood
as
she
runs
over
her
delicate
web
with
the
ringing
comb
hence
are
heard
afar
angry
cries
of
lions
chafing
at
their
fetters
and
roaring
in
the
deep
night
bears
and
bristly
swine
rage
in
their
pens
and
vast
shapes
of
wolves
howl
whom
with
her
potent
herbs
the
deadly
divine
circe
had
disfashioned
face
and
body
into
wild
beasts
from
the
likeness
of
men
but
lest
the
good
trojans
might
suffer
so
dread
a
change
might
enter
her
haven
or
draw
nigh
the
ominous
shores
neptune
filled
their
sails
with
favourable
winds
and
gave
them
escape
and
bore
them
past
the
seething
shallows
and
now
the
sea
reddened
with
shafts
of
light
and
high
in
heaven
the
yellow
dawn
shone
when
the
winds
fell
and
every
breath
sank
suddenly
and
the
toil
through
the
heavy
and
on
this
aeneas
descries
from
sea
a
mighty
forest
midway
in
it
the
pleasant
tiber
stream
breaks
to
sea
in
swirling
eddies
laden
with
yellow
sand
around
and
above

many
in

that
haunt
his
banks
and

with
song
and

to

and
glides
joyfully
into
the
shady
river
forth
now
erato
and
i
will
unfold
who
were
the
kings
what
the
tides
of
circumstance
how
it
was
with
ancient
latium
when
first
that
foreign
army
drew
their
fleet
ashore
on
ausonia
coast
i
will
recall
the
preluding
of
battle
thou
divine
one
inspire
thou
thy
poet
i
will
tell
of
grim
wars
tell
of
embattled
lines
of
kings
whom
honour
drove
on
death
of
the
tyrrhenian
forces
and
all
hesperia
enrolled
in
arms
a
greater
history
opens
before
me
a
greater
work
i
essay
latinus
the
king
now
growing
old
ruled
in
a
long
peace
over
quiet
tilth
and
town
he
men
say
was
sprung
of
faunus
and
the
nymph
marica
of
laurentum
faunus
father
was
picus
and
he
boasts
himself
saturn
thy
son
thou
art
the
first
source
of
their
blood
son
of
his
by
divine
ordinance
and
male
descent
was
none
cut
off
in
the
early
spring
of
youth
one
alone
kept
the
household
and
its
august
home
a
daughter
now
ripe
for
a
husband
and
of
full
years
for
marriage
many
wooed
her
from
wide
latium
and
all
ausonia
fairest
and
foremost
of
all
is
turnus
of
long
and
lordly
ancestry
but
boding
signs
from
heaven
many
and
terrible
bar
the
way
within
the
palace
in
the
lofty
inner
courts
was
a
laurel
of
sacred
foliage
guarded
in
awe
through
many
years
which
lord
latinus
it
was
said
himself
found
and
dedicated
to
phoebus
when
first
he
would
build
his
citadel
and
from
it
gave
his
settlers
their
name
laurentines
high
atop
of
it
wonderful
to
tell
bees
borne
with
loud
humming
across
the
liquid
air
girt
it
thickly
about
and
with
interlinked
feet
hung
in
a
sudden
swarm
from
the
leafy
bough
straightway
the
prophet
cries
see
a
foreigner
draw
nigh
an
army
from
the
same
quarter
seek
the
same
quarter
and
reign
high
in
our
fortress
furthermore
while
maiden
lavinia
stands
beside
her
father
feeding
the
altars
with
holy
fuel
she
was
seen
oh
horror
to
catch
fire
in
her
long
tresses
and
burn
with
flickering
flame
in
all
her
array
her
queenly
hair
lit
up
lit
up
her
jewelled
circlet
till
enwreathed
in
smoke
and
lurid
light
she
scattered
fire
over
all
the
palace
that
sight
was
rumoured
wonderful
and
terrible
herself
they
prophesied
she
should
be
glorious
in
fame
and
fortune
but
a
great
war
was
foreshadowed
for
her
people
but
the
king
troubled
by
the
omen
visits
the
oracle
of
his
father
faunus
the
soothsayer
and
the
groves
deep
under
albunea
where
queen
of
the
woods
she
echoes
from
her
holy
well
and
breathes
forth
a
dim
and
deadly
vapour
hence
do
the
tribes
of
italy
and
all
the
oenotrian
land
seek
answers
in
perplexity
hither
the
priest
bears
his
gifts
and
when
he
hath
lain
down
and
sought
slumber
under
the
silent
night
on
the
spread
fleeces
of
slaughtered
sheep
sees
many
flitting
phantoms
of
wonderful
wise
hears
manifold
voices
and
attains
converse
of
the
gods
and
hath
speech
with
acheron
and
the
deep
tract
of
hell
here
then
likewise
seeking
an
answer
lord
latinus
paid
fit
sacrifice
of
an
hundred
woolly
ewes
and
lay
couched
on
the
strewn
fleeces
they
had
worn
out
of
the
lofty
grove
a
sudden
voice
was
uttered
not
o
my
child
to
unite
thy
daughter
in
latin
espousals
nor
trust
her
to
the
bridal
chambers
ready
to
thine
hand
foreigners
shall
come
to
be
thy
sons
whose
blood
shall
raise
our
name
to
heaven
and
the
children
of
whose
race
shall
see
where
the
circling
sun
looks
on
either
ocean
all
the
rolling
world
swayed
beneath
their
feet
this
his
father
faunus
answer
and
counsel
given
in
the
silent
night
latinus
restrains
not
in
his
lips
but
rumour
had
already
borne
it
round
among
the
ausonian
cities
when
the
children
of
laomedon
moored
their
fleet
to
the
grassy
slope
of
the
river
bank
aeneas
with
the
foremost
of
his
captains
and
fair
iülus
lay
them
down
under
the
boughs
of
a
high
tree
and
array
the
feast
they
spread
wheaten
cakes
along
the
sward
under
their
meats
so
jove
on
high
prompted
and
crown
the
platter
of
corn
with
wilding
fruits
here
haply
when
the
rest
was
spent
and
scantness
of
food
set
them
to
eat
their
thin
bread
and
with
hand
and
venturous
teeth
do
violence
to
the
round
cakes
fraught
with
fate
and
spare
not
the
flattened
squares
are
we
eating
our
tables
too
cries
iülus
jesting
and
stops
at
once
that
accent
heard
set
their
toils
a
limit
and
at
once
as
he
spoke
his
father
caught
it
from
his
lips
and
hushed
him
in
amazement
at
the
omen
straightway
o
land
he
cries
destined
inheritance
and
hail
o
household
gods
faithful
to
your
troy
here
is
home
this
is
our
native
country
for
my
father
anchises
now
i
remember
it
bequeathed
me
this
secret
of
fate
when
hunger
shall
drive
thee
o
son
to
consume
thy
tables
where
the
feast
fails
on
the
unknown
shores
whither
thou
shalt
sail
then
though
outwearied
hope
for
home
and
there
at
last
let
thine
hand
remember
to
set
thy
house
foundations
and
bulwarks
this
was
the
hunger
this
the
last
that
awaited
us
to
set
the
promised
end
to
our
desolations
up
then
and
glad
with
the
first
sunbeam
let
us
explore
and
search
all
abroad
from
our
harbour
what
is
the
country
who
its
habitants
where
is
the
town
of
the
nation
now
pour
your
cups
to
jove
and
call
in
prayer
on
anchises
our
father
setting
the
wine
again
upon
the
board
so
speaks
he
and
binding
his
brows
with
a
leafy
bough
he
makes
supplication
to
the
genius
of
the
ground
and
earth
first
of
deities
and
the
nymphs
and
the
rivers
yet
unknown
then
calls
on
night
and
night
rising
signs
and
next
on
jove
of
ida
and
our
lady
of
phrygia
and
on
his
twain
parents
in
heaven
and
in
the
under
world
at
this
the
lord
omnipotent
thrice
thundered
sharp
from
high
heaven
and
with
his
own
hand
shook
out
for
a
sign
in
the
sky
a
cloud
ablaze
with
luminous
shafts
of
gold
a
sudden
rumour
spreads
among
the
trojan
array
that
the
day
is
come
to
found
their
destined
city
emulously
they
renew
the
feast
and
glad
at
the
high
omen
array
the
flagons
and
engarland
the
wine
soon
as
the
morrow
bathed
the
lands
in
its
dawning
light
they
part
to
search
out
the
town
and
the
borders
and
shores
of
the
nation
these
are
the
pools
and
spring
of
numicus
this
is
the
tiber
river
here
dwell
the
brave
latins
then
the
seed
of
anchises
commands
an
hundred
envoys
chosen
of
every
degree
to
go
to
the
stately
royal
city
all
with
the
wreathed
boughs
of
pallas
to
bear
him
gifts
and
desire
grace
for
the
teucrians
without
delay
they
hasten
on
their
message
and
advance
with
swift
step
himself
he
traces
the
city
walls
with
a
shallow
trench
and
builds
on
it
and
in
fashion
of
a
camp
girdles
this
first
settlement
on
the
shore
with
mound
and
battlements
and
now
his
men
had
traversed
their
way
they
espied
the
towers
and
steep
roofs
of
the
latins
and
drew
near
the
wall
before
the
city
boys
and
men
in
their
early
bloom
exercise
on
horseback
and
break
in
their
teams
on
the
dusty
ground
or
draw
ringing
bows
or
hurl
tough
javelins
from
the
shoulder
and
contend
in
running
and
boxing
when
a
messenger
riding
forward
brings
news
to
the
ears
of
the
aged
king
that
mighty
men
are
come
thither
in
unknown
raiment
he
gives
orders
to
call
them
within
his
house
and
takes
his
seat
in
the
midst
on
his
ancestral
throne
his
house
stately
and
vast
crowned
the
city
upreared
on
an
hundred
columns
once
the
palace
of
laurentian
picus
amid
awful
groves
of
ancestral
sanctity
here
their
kings
receive
the
inaugural
sceptre
and
have
the
fasces
first
raised
before
them
this
temple
was
their
this
their
sacred
here
after
sacrifice
of
rams
the
elders
were
wont
to
sit
down
at
long
tables
further
there
stood
arow
in
the
entry
images
of
the
forefathers
of
old
in
ancient
cedar
italus
and
lord
sabinus
planter
of
the
vine
still
holding
in
show
the
curved
and
gray
saturn
and
the
likeness
of
janus
the
and
the
rest
of
their
primal
kings
and

who
had
borne
wounds
of
war
in
fighting
for
their
country

besides
hangs
thickly
on
the
sacred
doors
captured
chariots
and
curved
axes
and
massy
lances
and
shields
and
beaks
torn
from
warships
he
too
sat
there
with
the
of
quirinus
girt
in
the
short
augural
gown
and
carrying
on
his
left
arm
the
sacred
shield
picus
the
tamer
of
horses
he
whom
circe
desperate
with
amorous
desire
smote
with
her
golden
rod
and
turned
by
her
poisons
into
a
bird
with
patches
of
colour
on
his
wings
of
such
wise
was
the
temple
of
the
gods
wherein
latinus
sitting
on
his
father
seat
summoned
the
teucrians
to
his
house
and
presence
and
when
they
entered
in
he
thus
opened
with
placid
mien
o
dardanians
for
we
are
not
ignorant
of
your
city
and

nor
unheard
of
do
you
bend
your

hath
borne
you
over

ausonian
shore

wandering
in

or
such

on
the
high

suffer
you

entered
the

and
lie
in

shun
not

no

fetter
to
justice
upright
of
their

will
and
the
custom
of
the
god
of
old
and
now
i
remember
though
the
story
is
dimmed
with
years
thus
auruncan
elders
told
how
dardanus
born
in
this
our
country
made
his
way
to
the
towns
of
phrygian
ida
and
to
the
thracian
samos
that
is
now
called
samothrace
here
was
the
home
he
left
tyrrhenian
corythus
now
the
palace
of
heaven
glittering
with
golden
stars
enthrones
and
adds
him
to
the
ranged
altars
of

he
ended
and
ilioneus
pursued
his
speech
with
these
words

and
lo
the
fierce

of

was
returning
from

and
held
her
way
along
the

when
out
of
the
distant
sky
far
as
from
sicilian
pachynus
she
espied
the
rejoicing
of
aeneas
and
the
dardanian
fleet
she
sees
them
already
already
trusting
in
the
land
their
ships
left
empty
she
stops
shot
with
sharp
pain
then
shaking
her
head
she
pours
forth
these

hated
brood

doom
of
the
phrygians
that
thwarts
our
doom
could
they
perish

consume
her
people
through
the
midst
of

and
through
the
midst
of

they
have
found
their
way
but
i
think
my
deity
lies
at

outwearied
or
my

sleeps
and
is
satisfied
nay
it
is
i
who
have
been
fierce
to
follow
them
over
the

when
hurled
from

on

indeed
stung
by
infinite
horrors
hapless
and
frenzied
she
rages
wildly
through

all
at

out
strange

blazing
on

the

of

does
allecto
goad
the

with
the
encircling
bacchic
madness
when
their
frenzy
seemed
heightened
and
her
first
task
complete
the
purpose
and
all
the
house
of
latinus
turned
upside
down
the
dolorous
goddess
flies
on
thence
soaring
on
dusky

to

now
took
rest
in

black
midnight
allecto
puts
off
her
grim

and
the
body
of
a
fury
she
transforms
her
face
to
an
aged
woman
and
furrows
her
brow
with
ugly
wrinkles
she
puts
on
white
tresses
and
entwines
them
with
an
olive
spray
she
becomes
aged

priestess
of

presents
herself
before
his

uttering
thus
wilt
thou
brook
all
these
toils
poured
out
in
vain
and
the
conveyance
of
thy

to
dardanian

the

denies

cut

this
saturn
omnipotent
daughter
in

commanded
me
to
pronounce
to
thee
as
thou

lying
in

night
wherefore
arise
and
make
ready
with
good
cheer
to
arm
thy

and

through
thy

to

consume
those

neither

forgetful

but
thee
o

overworn
old
age
exhausted
and
untrue
frets
with
vain
distress
and
amid
embattled
kings
mocks
thy
presage
with
false
dismay
thy

it
is
to
keep
the
divine
image
and
temple
war
and
peace
shall
be
in
the
hands
of

and
warriors
at
such
words
allecto
wrath
blazed
out
but
amid
his
utterance
a
quick
shudder
overruns
his
limbs
his
eyes
are
fixed
in
horror
so
thickly
hiss
the
snakes
of
the
fury
so
vast
her
form
expands
then
rolling
her
fiery
eyes
she
thrust
him
back
as
he
would
stammer
out
more
raised
two
serpents
in
her
hair
and
sounding
her
whip
resumed
with
furious
tone
me
the
overworn
me
whom
old

exhausted
and
untrue
mocks
with
false
dismay
amid
embattled
kings
look
on
this
i
am
come
from
the
home
of
the
dread
sisters
war
and
death
are
in
my
hand
so
speaking
she
hurled
her
torch
at
him
and
pierced
his
breast
with
the
lurid
smoking
brand
he
breaks
from
sleep
in
overpowering
fear
his
limbs
and
body
bathed
in
sweat
that
breaks
out
all
over
him
he
shrieks
madly
for
arms
searches
for
arms
on
his
bed
and
in
his
palace
the
passion
of
the
sword
rages
high
the
accursed
fury
of
war
and
wrath
over
all
even
as
when
flaming
sticks
are
heaped
roaring
loud
under
the
sides
of
a
seething
cauldron
and
the
boiling
water
leaps
up
the
river
of
water
within
smokes
furiously
and
swells
high
in
overflowing
foam
and
now
the
wave
contains
itself
no
longer
the
dark
steam
flies
aloft
so
for
the
stain
of
the
broken
peace
he
orders
his
chief
warriors
to
march
on
king
latinus
and
bids
prepare
for
battle
to
defend
italy
and
drive
the
foe
from
their
borders
himself
will
suffice
for
trojans
and
latins
together
when
he
uttered
these
words
and
called
the
gods
to
hear
his
vows
the
rutulians
stir
one
another
up
to
arms
one
is
moved
by
the
splendour
of
his
youthful
beauty
one
by
his
royal
ancestry
another
by
the
noble
deeds
of
his
hand
while
turnus
fills
the
rutulian
minds
with
valour
allecto
on
stygian
wing
hastens
towards
the
trojans
with
fresh
wiles
she
marked
the
spot
where
beautiful
iülus
was
trapping
and
coursing
game
on
the
bank
here
the
infernal
maiden
suddenly
crosses
his
hounds
with
the
maddening
touch
of
a
familiar
scent
and
drives
them
hotly
on
the

master
of

and
ranger
of

their
sister
silvia
tamed
him
to
her
rule
and
lavished
her
care
on
his
adornment
twining
his
antlers
with
delicate
garlands
and
combed
his
wild
coat
and
washed
him
in
the
clear
spring
tame
to
her
hand
and
familiar
to
his
master
table
he
would
wander
the
woods
and
however
late
the
night
return
home
to
the
door
he
knew
far
astray
he
floated
idly
down
the
stream
and
allayed
his
heat
on
the
green
bank
when
iülus
mad
hounds
started
him
in
their
hunting
and
ascanius
himself
kindled
with
desire
of
the
chief
honour
aimed
a
shaft
from
his
bended
bow
a
present
deity
suffered
not
his
hand
to
stray
and
the
loud
whistling
reed
came
driven
through
his
belly
and
flanks
but
the
wounded
beast
fled
within
the
familiar
roof
and
crept
moaning
to
the
courtyard
dabbled
with
blood
and
filling
all
the
house
with
moans
as
of
one
beseeching
sister
silvia
smiting
her
arms
with
open
hands
begins
to
call
for

gathers
the

seizing
from

seeks

crying

he
shut

in

shrank
away
averse

hid
himself
blindly
in

then
the

glided

flickers
abroad
over
all
the
room
and
now
mounts
aloft
and
strikes
the
high
panelled
roof
night
fell
and
over
all
lands
weary
creatures
were
fast
in
deep
slumber
the
race
of
fowl
and
of
cattle
when
lord
aeneas
sick
at
heart
of
the
dismal
warfare
stretched
him
on
the
river
bank
under
the
cope
of
the
cold
sky
and
let
sleep
though
late
overspread
his
limbs
to
him
the
very
god
of
the
ground
the
pleasant
tiber
stream
seemed
to
raise
his
aged
form
among
the
poplar
boughs
thin
lawn
veiled
him
with
its
gray
covering
and
shadowy
reeds
hid
his
hair
thereon
he
addressed
him
thus
and
with
these
words
allayed
his
distresses
born
of
the
family
of
the
gods
thou
who
bearest
back
our
trojan
city
from
hostile
hands
and
keepest
troy
towers
in
eternal
life
o
long
looked
for
on
laurentine
ground
and
latin
fields
here
is
thine
assured
home
thine
home
assured
gods
draw
not
thou
back
nor
be
alarmed
by
menace
of
war
all
the
anger
and
wrath
of
the
gods
is
passed
away
and
even
now
for
thine
assurance
that
thou
think
not
this
the
idle
fashioning
of
sleep
a
great
sow
shall
be
found
lying
under
the
oaks
on
the
shore
with
her
litter
of
thirty
head
white
she
couches
on
the
ground
and
the
brood
about
her
teats
is
white
by
this
token
in
thirty
revolving
years
shall
ascanius
found
a
city
alba
of
bright
name
my
prophecy
is
sure
now
hearken
and
i
will
briefly
instruct
thee
how
thou
mayest
unravel
and
overcome
thy
present
task
an
arcadian
people
sprung
of
pallas
following
in
their
king
evander
company
beneath
his
banners
have
chosen
a
place
in
these
coasts
and
set
a
city
on
the
hills
called
pallanteum
after
pallas
their
forefather
these
wage
perpetual
war
with
the
latin
race
these
do
thou
take
to
thy
alliance
and
join
with
them
in
league
myself
i
will
lead
thee
by
my
banks
and
straight
along
my
stream
that
thou
mayest
oar
thy
way
upward
against
the
river
up
and
arise
and
even
with
the
setting
stars
address
thy
prayers
to
juno
as
is
meet
and
vanquish
her
wrath
and
menaces
with
humble
vows
to
me
thou
shalt
pay
a
sacrifice
i
am
he
whom
thou
seest
washing
the
banks
with
full
flood
and
severing
the
rich
tilth
glassy
tiber
best
beloved
by
heaven
of
rivers
here
is
my
stately
home
my
is
among
high
cities
thus
spoke
the
river
and
sank
in
the
depth
of
the
pool
night
and
sleep
left
aeneas
he
arises
and
looking
towards
the
radiant
sky
of
the
sunrising
holds
up
water
from
the
river
in
palms
and
pours
to
heaven
these
accents
laurentine
nymphs
from
whom
is
the
generation
of
rivers
and
thou
o
father
tiber
with
thine
holy
flood
receive
aeneas
and
deign
to
save
him
out
of
danger
what
pool
soever
holds
thy
source
who
pitiest
our
discomforts
from
whatsoever
soil
thou
dost
spring
excellent
in
beauty
ever
shall
my
worship
ever
my
gifts
frequent
thee
the
hornèd
river
lord
of
hesperian
waters
ah
be
thou
only
by
me
and
graciously
confirm
thy
will
so
speaks
he
and
chooses
two
galleys
from
his
fleet
and
mans
them
with
rowers
and
withal
equips
a
crew
with
arms
and
lo
suddenly
ominous
and
wonderful
to
tell
the
sow
of
one
colour
with
her
white
brood
is
espied
through
the
forest
couched
on
the
green
brink
whom
to
thee
yes
to
thee
queenly
juno
good
aeneas
offers
in
sacrifice
and
sets
with
her
offspring
before
thine
altar
all
that
night
long
tiber
assuaged
his
swelling
stream
and
silently
stayed
his
refluent
wave
smoothing
the
surface
of
his
waters
to
the
fashion
of
still
pool
and
quiet
mere
to
spare
labour
to
the
oar
so
they
set
out
and
speed
on
their
way
with
prosperous
cries
the
painted
fir
slides
along
the
waterway
the
waves
and
unwonted
woods
marvel
at
their
shields
and
the
gay
hulls
afloat
on
the
river
they
outwear
a
night
and
a
day
in
rowing
ascend
the
long
reaches
and
pass
under
the
chequered
shadows
of
the
trees
and
cut
through
the
green
woodland
in
the
calm
water
the
fiery
sun
had
climbed
midway
in
the
circle
of
the
sky
when
they
see
afar
fortress
walls
and
scattered
house
roofs
where
now
the
might
of
rome
hath
risen
high
as
heaven
then
evander
held
a
slender
state
quickly
they
turn
their
prows
to
land
and
draw
near
the
town
it
chanced
on
that
day
the
arcadian
king
paid
his
accustomed
sacrifice
to
the
great
son
of
amphitryon
and
all
the
gods
in
a
grove
before
the
city
with
him
his
son
pallas
with
him
all
the
chief
of
his
people
and
his
poor
senate
were
offering
incense
and
the
blood
steamed
warm
at
their
altars
when
they
saw
the
high
ships
saw
them
glide
up
between
the
shady
woodlands
and
rest
on
their
silent
oars
the
sudden
sight
appals
them
and
all
at
once
they
rise
and
stop
the
banquet
pallas
courageously
forbids
them
to
break
off
the
rites
snatching
up
a
spear
he
flies
forward
and
from
a
hillock
cries
afar
men
what
cause
hath
driven
you
to
explore
these
unknown
ways
or
whither
do
you
steer
what
is
your
kin
whence
your
habitation
is
it
peace
or
arms
you
carry
hither
then
from
the
lofty
stern
lord
aeneas
thus
speaks
stretching
forth
in
his
hand
an
olive
bough
of
seest
men
born
of
troy
and
arms
hostile
to
the
latins
who
have
driven
us
to
flight
in
insolent
warfare
we
seek
evander
carry
this
message
and
tell
him
that
chosen
men
of
the
dardanian
captains
are
come
pleading
for
an
armed
alliance
pallas
stood
amazed
at
the
august
name
he
cries
thou
art
and
speak
with
my
father
face
to
face
and
enter
our
home
and
hospitality
and
giving
him
the
grasp
of
welcome
he
caught
and
clung
to
his
hand
advancing
they
enter
the
grove
and
leave
the
river
then
aeneas
in
courteous
words
addresses
the
king
of
the
grecian
race
thou
whom
fortune
hath
willed
that
i
supplicate
holding
before
me
boughs
dressed
in
fillets
no
fear
stayed
me
because
thou
wert
a
grecian
chief
and
an
arcadian
or
allied
by
descent
to
the
twin
sons
of
atreus
nay
mine
own
prowess
and
the
sanctity
of
divine
oracles
our
ancestral
kinship
and
the
fame
of
thee
that
is
spread
abroad
over
the
earth
have
allied
me
to
thee
and
led
me
willingly
on
the
path
of
fate
dardanus
who
sailed
to
the
teucrian
land
the
first
father
and
founder
of
the
ilian
city
was
born
as
greeks
relate
of

the

sustains
the
heavenly

your
father
is

whom
white
maia
conceived
and
bore
on
the
cold
summit
of
cyllene
but
maia
if
we
give
any
credence
to
report
is
daughter
of
atlas
that
same
atlas
who
bears
up
the
starry
heavens
so
both
our
families
branch
from
a
single
blood
in
this
confidence
i
sent
no
embassy
i
framed
no
crafty
overtures
myself
i
have
presented
mine
own
person
and
come
a
suppliant
to
thy
courts
the
same
daunian
race
pursues
us
and
thee
in
merciless
warfare
we
once
expelled
they
trust
nothing
will
withhold
them
from
laying
all
hesperia
wholly
beneath
their
yoke
and
holding
the
seas
that
wash
it
above
and
below
accept
and
return
our
friendship
we
can
give
brave
hearts
in
war
high
souls
and
men

ended
the

ere
now
scanned
in
a

gaze
the
face
and

and
all
the
form
of
the
speaker
then
thus
briefly
returns
gladly
bravest
of
the
teucrians
do
i
hail
and
own
thee
how
i
recall
thy
father
words
and
the
very
tone
and
glance
of
great
anchises
for
i
remember
how
priam
son
of
laomedon
when
he
sought
salamis
on
his
way
to
the
realm
of
his
sister
hesione
went
on
to
visit
the
cold
borders
of
arcadia
then
early
youth
clad
my
cheeks
with
bloom
i
admired
the
teucrian
captains
admired
their
lord
the
son
of
laomedon
but
anchises
moved
high
above
them
all
my
heart
burned
with
youthful
passion
to
accost
him
and
clasp
hand
in
hand
i
made
my
way
to
him
and
led
him
eagerly
to
pheneus
high
town
departing
he
gave
me
an
adorned
quiver
and
lycian
arrows
a
scarf
inwoven
with
gold
and
a
pair
of
golden
bits
that
now
my
pallas
possesses
therefore
my
hand
is
already
joined
in
the
alliance
you
seek
and
soon
as
dawn
rises
again
over
earth
i
will
send
you
away
rejoicing
in
mine
aid
and
supply
you
from
my
store
meanwhile
since
you
are
come
hither
in
friendship
solemnise
with
us
these
yearly
rites
which
we
may
not
defer
and
even
now
learn
to
be
familiar
at
your
comrades
board
this
said
he
commands
the
feast
and
the
to
be
replaced
whence
they
were
taken
and
with
his
own
hand
ranges
them
on
the
grassy
seat
and
welcomes

to
the
place
of
honour
with
a
lion

driven
away
and

stayed
king
evander
speaks
idle
superstition
that
knows
not
the
gods
of
old
hath
ordered
these
our
solemn
rites
this
customary
feast
this
altar
of
august
sanctity
saved
from
bitter
perils
o
trojan
guest
do
we
worship
and
most
due
are
the
rites
we
inaugurate
look
now
first
on
this
overhanging
cliff
of
stone
where
shattered
masses
lie
strewn
and
the
mountain
dwelling
stands
desolate
and
rocks
are
rent
away
in
vast
ruin
here
was
a
cavern
awful
and
impenetrable
to
the
sunbeams
where
the
monstrous
shape
of
cacus
had
his
hold
the
ground
was
ever
wet
with
fresh
slaughter
and
pallid
faces
of
men
ghastly
with
gore
hung
nailed
on
the
haughty
doors
this
monster
was
the
son
of
vulcan
and
spouted
his
black
fires
from
his
mouth
as
he
moved
in
giant
bulk
to
us
also
in
our
desire
time
bore
a
god
aid
and
arrival
for
princely
alcides
the
avenger
came
glorious
in
the
spoils
of
triple
geryon
slain
this
way
the
conqueror
drove
the
huge
bulls
and
his
oxen
filled
the
river
valley
but
savage
cacus
infatuate
to
leave
nothing
undared
or
unhandled
in
craft
or
crime
drives
four
bulls
of
choice
shape
away
from
their
pasturage
and
as
many
heifers
of
excellent
beauty
and
these
that
there
should
be
no
straightforward
footprints
he
dragged
by
the
tail
into
his
cavern
the
track
of
their
compelled
path
reversed
and
hid
them
behind
the
screen
of
rock
no
marks
were
there
to
lead
a
seeker
to
the
cavern
meanwhile
the
son
of
amphitryon
his
herds
filled
with
food
was
now
breaking
up
his
pasturage
and
making
ready
to
go
the
oxen
low
as
they
depart
all
the
woodland
is
filled
with
their
complaint
as
they
clamorously
quit
the
hills
one
heifer
returned
the
cry
and
lowing
from
the
depth
of
the
dreary
cave
baffled
the
hope
of
cacus
from
her
imprisonment
at
this
the
grief
and
choler
of
alcides
blazed
forth
dark
and
infuriate
seizing
in
his
hand
his
club
of
heavy
knotted
oak
he
seeks
with
swift
pace
the
aery
mountain
steep
then
as
never
before
did
we
see
cacus
afraid
and
his
countenance
troubled
he
goes
flying
swifter
than
the
wind
and
seeks
his
cavern
fear
wings
his
feet
as
he
shut
himself
in
and
bursting
the
chains
dropped
the
vast
rock
slung
in
iron
by
his
father
craft
and
blocked
the
doorway
with
its
pressure
lo
the
tirynthian
came
in
furious
wrath
and
scanning
all
the
entry
turned
his
face
this
way
and
that
and
ground
his
teeth
thrice
hot
with
rage
he
circles
all
mount
aventine
thrice
he
assails
the
rocky
portals
in
vain
thrice
he
sinks
down
outwearied
in
the
valley
there
stood
a
sharp
rock
of
flint
with
sides
cut
sheer
away
rising
over
the
cavern
ridge
a
vast
height
to
see
fit
haunt
for
foul
birds
to
build
on
this
for
sloping
from
the
ridge
it
leaned
on
the
left
towards
the
river
he
loosened
urging
it
from
the
right
till
he
tore
it
loose
from
its
deep
foundations
then
suddenly
shook
it
free
with
the
shock
the
vast
sky
thunders
the
banks
leap
apart
and
the
amazed
river
recoils
but
the
den
cacus
huge
palace
lay
open
and
revealed
and
the
depths
of
gloomy
cavern
were
made
manifest
even
as
though
some
force
tearing
earth
apart
should
unlock
the
infernal
house
and
disclose
the
pallid
realms
abhorred
of
heaven
and
deep
down
the
monstrous
gulf
be
descried
where
the
ghosts
flutter
in
the
streaming
daylight
on
him
then
surprised
in
unexpected
light
shut
in
the
rock
recesses
and
howling
in
strange
fashion
alcides
from
above
hurls
missiles
and
calls
all
his
arms
to
aid
and
presses
hard
on
him
with
boughs
and
enormous
millstones
and
he
for
none
other
escape
from
peril
is
left
vomits
from
his
throat
vast
jets
of
smoke
wonderful
to
tell
and
enwreathes
his
dwelling
in
blind
gloom
blotting
view
from
the
eyes
while
in
the
cave
depth
night
thickens
with
in
a
darkness
shot
with
fire
alcides
broke
forth
in
anger
and
with
a
bound
hurled
himself
sheer
amid
the
flames
where
the
smoke
rolls
billowing
and
voluminous
and
the
cloud
surges
black
through
the
enormous
den
here
as
cacus
in
the
darkness
spouts
forth
his
idle
fires
he
grasps
and
twines
tight
round
him
till
his
eyes
start
out
and
his
throat
is
drained
of
blood
under
the
strangling
pressure
straightway
the
doors
are
torn
open
and
the
dark
house
laid
plain
the
stolen
oxen
and
forsworn
plunder
are
shewn
forth
to
heaven
and
the
misshapen
carcase
dragged
forward
by
the
feet
men
can
not
satisfy
their
soul
with
gazing
on
the
terrible
eyes
the
monstrous
face
and
shaggy
bristling
chest
and
the
throat
with
its
quenched
fires
thenceforth
this
sacrifice
is
solemnised
and
a
younger
race
have
gladly
kept
the
day
potitius
the
inaugurator
and
the
pinarian
family
guardians
of
the
rites
of
hercules
have
set
in
the
grove
this
altar
which
shall
ever
be
called
of
us
most
mighty
and
shall
be
our
mightiest
evermore
wherefore
arise
o
men
and
enwreathe
your
hair
with
leafy
sprays
and
stretch
forth
the
cups
in
your
hands
call
on
our
common
god
and
pour
the
glad
wine
he
ended
when
the
poplar
of
hercules
hid
his
shaded
hair
with
pendulous
plaited
leaf
and
the
sacred
goblet
filled
his
hand
speedily
all
pour
glad
libation
on
the
board
and
supplicate
the
gods
meanwhile
the
evening
star
draws
nigher
down
the
slope
of
heaven
and
now
the
priests
went
forth
potitius
at
their
head
girt
with
skins
after
their
fashion
and
bore
torches
aflame
they
renew
the
banquet
and
bring
the
grateful
gift
of
a
second
repast
and
heap
the
altars
with
loaded
platters
then
the
salii
stand
round
the
lit
to
sing
their
brows
bound
with
poplar
boughs
one
chorus
of
young
men
one
of
elders
and
extol
in
song
the
praises
and
deeds
of
hercules
how
first
he
strangled
in
his
gripe
the
twin
terrors
the
snakes
of
his
stepmother
how
he
likewise
shattered
in
war
famous
cities
troy
and
oechalia
how
under
eurystheus
the
king
he
bore
the
toil
of
a
thousand
labours
by
juno
malign
decrees
thine

unconquered

sprung
of

and
a

of

born
of

who
had
neither

nor

of

nor
did
they

long

saturn
came
from
heaven
on
high
in
flight
before
jove
arms
an
exile
from
his
lost
realm
he
gathered
together
the
unruly
race
scattered
on
the
mountain
heights
and
gave
them
statutes
and
chose
latium
to
be
their
name
since
in
these
borders
he
had
found
a
safe
beneath
his
reign
were
the
ages
named
of
gold
thus
in
peace
and
quietness
did
he
rule
the
nations
till
gradually
there
crept
in
a
sunken
and
stained
time
the
rage
of
war
and
the
lust
of
possession
then
came
the
ausonian
clan
and
the
tribes
of
sicania
and
many
a
time
the
land
of
saturn
put
away
her
name
then
were
kings
and
fierce
thybris
with
his
giant
bulk
from
whose
name
we
of
italy
afterwards
called
the
tiber
river
when
it
lost
the
true
name
of
old
albula
me
cast
out
from
my
country
and
following
the
utmost
limits
of
the
sea
fortune
the
omnipotent
and
irreversible
doom
settled
in
this
region
and
my
mother
the
nymph
carmentis
awful
warnings
and
apollo

counsel
drove
me
hither
scarce
was
this
said
next
advancing
he
points
out
the
altar
and
the
carmental
gate
which
the
romans
call
anciently
by
that
name
in
honour
of
the
nymph
carmentis
seer
and
soothsayer
who
sang
of
old
the
coming
greatness
of
the
aeneadae
and
the
glory
of
pallanteum
next
he
points
out
the
wide
grove
where
valiant
romulus
set
his
sanctuary
and
the
lupercal
in
the
cool
hollow
of
the
rock
dedicate
to
lycean
pan
after
the
manner
of
parrhasia
therewithal
he
shows
the
holy
wood
of
argiletum
and
calls
the
spot
to
witness
as
he
tells
the
slaying
of
his
guest
argus
hence
he
leads
him
to
the
tarpeian
house
and
the
capitol
golden
now
of

rough
with

thickets
even
then
men
trembled
before

its

crown
is
a

though
whose
we
know
not
the
arcadians
believe
jove
himself
hath
been
visible
when
often
he
shook
the
darkening
aegis
in
his
hand
and
gathered
the
thou
seest
these
two
towns
likewise
with
walls
overthrown
relics
and

of
men
of
old
this
fortress
lord
janus
built
this
saturn
the
name
of
this
was
once
janiculum
of
that
saturnia
with
such
mutual
words
they
drew
nigh
the
house
of
poor
evander
and
saw
scattered
herds
lowing
on
the
roman
forum
and
down
the
gay
carinae
when
they
reached
his
dwelling
threshold
he
cries
the
conqueror
stooped
to
cross
in
this
palace
he
rested
dare
thou
my
guest
to
despise
riches
mould
thyself
to
like
dignity
of
godhead
and
come
not
exacting
to
our
poverty
he
spoke
and
led
tall
aeneas
under
the
low
roof
of
his
narrow
dwelling
and
laid
him
on
a
couch
of
stuffed
leaves
and
the
skin
of
a
libyan
night
falls
and
clasps
the
earth
in
her
dusky
wings
but
venus
stirred
in
spirit
by
no
vain
mother
alarms
and
moved
by
the
threats
and
stern
uprisal
of
the
laurentines
addresses
herself
to
vulcan
and
in
her
golden
bridal
chamber
begins
thus
breathing
divine
passion
in
her
speech
argolic
kings
wasted
in
war
the
doomed
towers
of
troy
the
fortress
fated
to
fall
in
hostile
fires
no
succour
did
i
require
for
her
wretched
people
no
weapons
of
thine
art
and
aid
nor
would
i
task
dear
my
lord
thee
or
thy
toils
for
naught
though
i
owed
many
and
many
a
debt
to
the
children
of
priam
and
had
often
wept
the
sore
labour
of
aeneas
now
by
jove
commands
he
hath
set
foot
in
the
rutulian
borders
i
now
therefore
come
with
entreaty
and
ask
armour
of
the
god
i
worship
for
the
son
she
bore
the
tears
of
nereus
daughter
of
consort
could
melt
thine
heart
look
what
nations
are
gathering
what
cities
bar
their
gates
and
sharpen
the
sword
against
me
for
the
desolation
of
my
children
the
goddess
ended
and
as
he
hesitates
clasps
him
round
in
the
soft
embrace
of
her
snowy
arms
he
suddenly
caught
the
wonted
flame
and
the
heat
known
of
old
pierced
him
to
the
heart
and
overran
his
melting
frame
even
as
when
bursting
from
the
thunder
peal
a
sparkling
cleft
of
fire
shoots
through
the
with
dazzling
light
his
consort
knew
rejoiced
in
her
wiles
and
felt
her
beauty
then
her
lord
speaks
enchained
by
love
the
immortal
these
pleas
whither
o
goddess
is
thy
trust
in
me
gone
had
like
distress
been
thine
even
then
we
might
unblamed
have
armed
thy
trojans
nor
did
doom
nor
the
lord
omnipotent
forbid
troy
to
stand
and
priam
to
survive
yet
ten
other
years
and
now
if
thou
purposest
war
and
this
is
thy
counsel
whatever
charge
i
can
undertake
in
my
craft
in
aught
that
may
be
made
of
iron
or
molten
electrum
whatever
fire
and
air
can
do
cease
thou
to
entreat
as
doubtful
of
thy
strength
these
words
spoken
he
clasped
his
wife
in
the
desired
embrace
and
sinking
in
her
lap
wooed
quiet
slumber
to
overspread
his
limbs
thereon
so
soon
as
sleep
now
in
of
waning
night
had
given
rest
and
gone
soon

sets
a

for
many

it
flourished
till

it
with

the

of

may
the

at

his

outwearied

excesses
surround

not
the
cytherean
sent
a

from

for
suddenly
a
flash
and
peal
comes
quivering
from
heaven
and
all
seemed
in
a
moment
to
totter
and
the
tyrrhene
to
roar
along
the
sky
they
look
up
again
and
yet
again
the
heavy
crash
they
see
in
the
serene
space
of
sky
armour
gleam
red
through
a
cloud
in
the
clear
air
and
ring
clashing
out
the
others
stood
in
amaze
but
the
trojan
hero
knew
the
sound
for
the
promise
of
his
goddess
mother
then
he
speaks
not
o
friend
ask
not
in
any
wise
what
fortune
this
presage
announces
it
is
i
who
am
summoned
of
heaven
this
sign
the
goddess
who
bore
me
foretold
she
would
send
if
war
assailed
and
would
bring
through
the
air
to
my
succour
armour
from
vulcan
hands
ah
what
slaughter
awaits
the
wretched
laurentines
what
a
price
o
turnus
wilt
thou
pay
me
how
many
shields
and
helmets
and
brave
bodies
of
men
shalt
thou
lord
tiber
roll
under
thy
waves
let
them
call
for
armed
array
and
break
the
league
these
words
uttered
he
rises
from
the
high
seat
and
first
wakes
with
fresh
fire
the
slumbering
altars
of
hercules
and
gladly
draws
nigh
his
tutelar
god
of
yesternight
and
the
small
deities
of
the
household
alike
evander
and
alike
the
men
of
troy
offer
up
as
is
right
choice
sheep
of
two
years
old
thereafter
he
goes
to
the
ships
and
revisits
his
crew
of
whose
company
he
chooses
the

valour
to

him
to

down

that
glitters
with

rumour
flies
suddenly
spreading
over
the
little
town
that
they
ride
in
haste
to
the
courts
of
the
tyrrhene
king
mothers
redouble
their
prayers
in
terror
as
fear
treads
closer
on
peril
and
the
likeness
of
the
war
god
looms
larger
in
sight
then
evander
clasping
the
hand
of
his
departing
son
clings
to
him
weeping
inconsolably
and
speaks
thus
if
jupiter
would
restore
me
the
years
that
are
past
as
i
was
when
close
under
praeneste
i
cut
down
their
foremost
ranks
and
burned
the
piled
shields
of
the
conquered
then
this

down

you
o

thou

have
compassion
i
pray
on

keep

if

thou

ah

had
fulfilled
their
due
time
when
turnus
injury
stirred
the
mother
to
ward
the
brands
from
her
holy
ships
first
then
a
strange
light
flashed
on
all
eyes
and
a
great
glory
from
the
dawn
seemed
to
dart
over
the
sky
with
the
choirs
of
ida
then
an
awful
voice
fell
through
air
filling
the
trojan
and
rutulian
ranks
not
yourselves
o
teucrians
to
guard
ships
of
mine
neither
arm
your
hands
sooner
shall
turnus
burn
the
seas
than
these
holy
pines
you
go
free
go
goddesses
of
the
sea
the
mother
bids
it
and
immediately
each
ship
breaks
the
bond
that
held
it
as
with
dipping
prows
they
plunge
like
dolphins
deep
into
the
water
from
it
again
o
wonderful
and
strange
they
rise
with
maidens
faces
in
like
number
and
bear
out
to
sea
the
rutulians
stood
dumb
messapus
himself
is
among
his
disordered
cavalry
even
the
stream
of
tiber
pauses
with
hoarse
murmur
and
recoils
from
sea
but
bold
turnus
fails
not
a
whit
in
confidence
nay
he
raises
their
courage
with
words
nay
he
chides
them
the
trojans
are
these
portents
aimed
jupiter
himself
hath
bereft
them
of
their
wonted
succour
nor
do
they
abide
rutulian
sword
and
fire
so
are
the
seas
pathless
for
the
teucrians
nor
is
there
any
hope
in
flight
they
have
lost
half
their
world
and
we
hold
the
land
in
all
their
thousands
the
nations
of
italy
are
under
arms
in
no
wise
am
i
dismayed
by
those
divine
oracles
of
doom
the
phrygians
insolently
advance
fate
and
venus
are
satisfied
in
that
the
trojans
have
touched
our
fruitful
ausonian
fields
i
too
have
my
fate
in
reply
to
theirs
to
put
utterly
to
the
sword
the
guilty
nation
who
have
robbed
me
of
my
bride
not
the
sons
of
atreus
alone
are
touched
by
that
pain
nor
may
mycenae
only
rise
in
arms
but
to
have
perished
once
is
enough
to
have
sinned
once
should
have
been
enough
in
all
but
utter
hatred
of
the
whole
of
womankind
trust
in
the
sundering
rampart
and
the
hindrance
of
their
trenches
so
little
between
them
and
death
gives
these
their
courage
yet
have
they
not
seen
troy
town
the
work
of
neptune
hand
sink
into
fire
but
you
my
chosen
who
of
you
makes
ready
to
breach
their
palisade
at
the
sword
point
and
join
my
attack
on
their
fluttered
camp
i
have
no
need
of
vulcanian
arms
of
a
thousand
ships
to
meet
the
teucrians
all
etruria
may
join
on
with
them
in
alliance
nor
let
them
fear
the
darkness
and
the
cowardly
theft
of
their
palladium
and
the
guards
cut
down
on
the
fortress
height
nor
will
we
hide
ourselves
unseen
in
a
horse
belly
in
daylight
and
unconcealed
are
we
resolved
to
girdle
their
walls
with
flame
not
with
grecians
will
i
make
them
think
they
have
to
do
nor
a
pelasgic
force
kept
off

the
tenth

by
hector
now
since
the
better
part
of

is
spent
for

refresh
your

glad
that
we
have
done
so
well
and
expect
the

of

meanwhile

on

at

was
nisus
son
of
hyrtacus
most
valiant
in
arms
whom
ida
the
huntress
had
sent
in
aeneas
company
with
fleet
javelin
and
light
arrows
and
by
his
side
euryalus
fairest
of
all
the
aeneadae
and
the
wearers
of
trojan
arms
showing
on
his
unshaven
boy
face
the
first
bloom
of
youth
these
two
were
one
in
affection
and
charged
in
battle
together
now
likewise
their
common
guard
kept
the

nisus
cries
the
gods
this
fervour
to
the
soul
euryalus
or
does
fatal
passion
become
a
proper
god
to
each
long
ere
now
my
soul
is
restless
to
begin
some
great
deed
of
arms
and
quiet
peace
delights
it
not
thou
seest
how
confident
in
fortune
the
rutulians
stand
their
lights
glimmer
far
apart
buried
in
drunken
sleep
they
have
sunk
to
rest
silence
stretches
all
about
learn
then
what
doubt
what
purpose
now
rises
in
my
spirit
people
and
senate
they
all
cry
that
aeneas
be
summoned
and
men
be
sent
to
carry
him
tidings
if
they
promise
what
i
ask
in
thy
name
for
to
me
the
glory
of
the
deed
is
enough
methinks
i
can
find
beneath
yonder
hillock
a
path
to
the
walls
of
pallanteum
town
euryalus
stood
fixed
struck
through
with
high
ambition
and
therewith
speaks
thus
to
his
fervid
friend
thou
shun
me
then
nisus
to
share
thy
company
in
highest
deeds
shall
i
send
thee
alone
into
so
great
perils
not
thus
did
my
warrior
father
opheltes
rear
and
nurture
me
amid
the
argive
terror
and
the
agony
of
troy
nor
thus
have
i
borne
myself
by
thy
side
while
following
noble
aeneas
to
his
utmost
fate
here
is
a
spirit
yes
here
that
scorns
the
light
of
day
that
deems
lightly
bought
at
a
life
price
that
honour
to
which
thou
dost
aspire
to
this
nisus
i
had
no
such
fear
of
thee
no
nor
could
i
so
may
great
jupiter
or
whoso
looks
on
earth
with
equal
eyes
restore
me
to
thee
triumphant
but
if
haply
as
thou
seest
often
and
often
in
so
forlorn
a
hope
if
haply
chance
or
deity
sweep
me
to
adverse
doom
i
would
have
thee
survive
thine
age
is
worthier
to
live
be
there
one
to
commit
me
duly
to
earth
rescued
or
ransomed
from
the
battlefield
or
if
fortune
deny
that
to
pay
me
far
away
the
rites
of
funeral
and
the
grace
of
a
tomb
neither
would
i
bring
such
pain
on
thy
poor
mother
she
who
singly
of
many
matrons
hath
dared
to
follow
her
boy
to
the
end
and
slights
great
acestes
city
and
he
vain
dost
thou
string
idle
reasons
nor
does
my
purpose
yield
or
change
its
place
so
soon
let
us
make
haste
he
speaks
and
rouses
the
watch
they
come
up
and
relieve
the
guard
quitting
their
post
he
and
nisus
stride
on
to
seek
the
prince
the
rest
of
living
things
over
all
lands
were
soothing
their
cares
in
sleep
and
their
hearts
forgot
their
pain
the
foremost
trojan
captains
a
chosen
band
held
council
of
state
upon
the
kingdom
what
should
they
do
or
who
would
now
be
their
messenger
to
aeneas
they
stand
leaning
on
their
long
spears
and
grasping
their
shields
in
mid
level
of
the
camp
then
nisus
and
euryalus
together
pray
with
quick
urgency
to
be
given
audience
their
matter
is
weighty
and
will
be
worth
the
delay
iülus
at
once
heard
their
hurried
plea
and
bade
nisus
speak
thereon
the
son
of
hyrtacus
o
people
of
aeneas
with
favourable
mind
nor
regard
our
years
in
what
we
offer
sunk
in
sleep
and
wine
the
rutulians
are
silent
we
have
stealthily
spied
the
open
ground
that
lies
in
the
path
through
the
gate
next
the
sea
the
line
of
fires
is
broken
and
their
smoke
rises
darkly
upwards
if
you
allow
us
to
use
the
chance
towards
seeking
aeneas
in
pallanteum
town
you
will
soon
descry
us
here
at
hand
with
the
spoils
of
the
great
slaughter
we
have
dealt
nor
shall
we
miss
the
way
we
go
up
the
dim
valleys
we
have
seen
the
skirts
of
the
town
and
learned
all
the
river
in
continual
hunting
thereon
aged
aletes
sage
in
counsel
of
our
fathers
under
whose
deity
troy
ever
stands
not
wholly
yet
do
you
purpose
to
blot
out
the
trojan
race
when
you
have
brought
us
young
honour
and
hearts
so
sure
as
this
so
speaking
he
caught
both
by
shoulder
and
hand
with
tears
showering
down
over
face
and
feature
guerdon
shall
i
deem
may
be
given
you
o
men
what
recompense
for
these
noble
deeds
first
and
fairest
shall
be
your
reward
from
the
gods
and
your
own
conduct
and
aeneas
the
good
shall
speedily
repay
the
rest
and
ascanius
fresh
youth
never
forget
so
great
a
service
breaks
in
ascanius
whose
sole
safety
is
in
my
father
return
i
adjure
thee
and
him
o
nisus
by
our
great
household
gods
by
the
tutelar
spirit
of
assaracus
and
hoar

on
your

i
lay
all
my
fortune
and
trust
recall
my
father
give
him
back
to
sight
all
sorrow
disappears
in
his
recovery
i
will
give
a
pair
of
cups
my
father
took
in
vanquished
arisba
wrought
in
silver
and
rough
with
tracery
twin
tripods
and
two
large
talents
of
gold
and
an
ancient
bowl
of
sidonian
dido
giving
if
it
be
indeed
our
lot
to
possess
italy
and
grasp
a
conquering
sceptre
and
to
assign
the
spoil
thou
sawest
the
horse
and
armour
of
turnus
as
he
went
all
in
gold
that
same
horse
the
shield
and
the
ruddy
plume
will
i
reserve
from
partition
thy
reward
o
nisus
even
from
now
my
father
will
give
besides
twelve
mothers
of
the
choicest
beauty
and
men
captives
all
in
their
due
array
above
these
the
space
of
that
is
now
king
latinus
own
domain
thee
o
noble
boy
whom
mine
age
follows
at
a
nearer
interval
even
now
i
welcome
to
all
my
heart
and
embrace
as
my
companion
in
every
fortune
no
glory
shall
be
sought
for
my
state
without
thee
whether
peace
or
war
be
in
conduct
my
chiefest
trust
for
deed
and
word
shall
be
in
thee
answering
whom
euryalus
speaks
thus
but
the
day
never
come
to
prove
me
degenerate
from
this
daring
valour
fortune
may
fall
prosperous
or
adverse
but
above
all
thy
gifts
one
thing
i
ask
of
thee
my
poor
mother
of
priam
ancient
race
whom
neither
the
ilian
land
nor
king
acestes
city
kept
from
following
me
forth
her
i
now
leave
in
ignorance
of
this
danger
such
as
it
is
and
without
a
farewell
because
night
and
thine
hand
be
witness
i
can
not
bear
a
parent
tears
but
thou
i
pray
support
her
want
and
relieve
her
loneliness
let
me
take
with
me
this
hope
in
thee
i
shall
go
more
daringly
to
every
fortune
deeply
stirred
at
heart
the
dardanians
shed
tears
fair
iülus
before
them
all
as
the
likeness
of
his
own
father
love
wrung
his
soul
then
he
speaks
thus
thyself
all
that
is
due
to
thy
mighty
enterprise
for
she
shall
be
a
mother
to
me
and
only
in
name
fail
to
be
creüsa
nor
slight
is
the
honour
reserved
for
the
mother
of
such
a
son
what
chance
soever
follow
this
deed
i
swear
by
this
head
whereby
my
father
was
wont
to
swear
what
i
promise
to
thee
on
thy
prosperous
return
shall
abide
the
same
for
thy
mother
and
kindred
so
speaks
he
weeping
and
ungirds
from
his
shoulder
the
sword
inlaid
with
gold
fashioned
with
marvellous
skill
by
lycaon
of
gnosus
and
fitly
set
in
a
sheath
of
ivory
mnestheus
gives
nisus
the
shaggy
spoils
of
a
hide
faithful
aletes
exchanges
his
helmet
they
advance
onward
in
arms
and
as
they
go
all
the
company
of
captains
young
and
old
speed
them
to
the
gates
with
vows
likewise
fair
iülus
with
a
man
thought
and
a
spirit
beyond
his
years
gave
many
messages
to
be
carried
to
his
father
but
the
breezes
shred
all
asunder
and
give
them
unaccomplished
to
the
clouds
they
issue
and
cross
the
trenches
and
through
the
shadow
of
night
seek
the
fatal
camp
themselves
first
to
be
the
death
of
many
a
man
all
about
they
see
bodies
strewn
along
the
grass
in
drunken
sleep
chariots
atilt
on
the
shore
the
men
lying
among
their
traces
and
wheels
with
their
armour
by
them
and
their
wine
the
son
of
hyrtacus
began
thus
now
for
daring
hands
all
invites
them
here
lies
our
way
see
thou
that
none
raise
a
hand
from
behind
against
us
and
keep
watch
here
will
i
deal
desolation
and
make
a
broad
path
for
thee
to
follow
so
speaks
he
and
checks
his
voice
therewith
he
drives
his
sword
at
lordly
rhamnes
who
haply
on
carpets
heaped
high
was
drawing
the
full
breath
of
sleep
a
king
himself
and
king
augur
but
not
all
his
augury
could
avert
his
doom
three
of
his
household
beside
him
lying
carelessly
among
their
arms
and
the
and
charioteer
of
remus
go
down
before
him
caught
at
the
horses
feet
their
drooping
necks
he
severs
with
the
sword
then
beheads
their
lord
likewise
and
leaves
the
trunk
spouting
blood
the
dark
warm
gore
soaks
ground
and
cushions
therewithal
lamyrus
and
lamus
and
beautiful
young
serranus
who
that
night
had
played
long
and
late
and
lay
with
the
conquering
god
heavy
on
every
limb
happy
had
he
played
out
the
night
and
carried
his
game
to
day
even
thus
an
unfed
lion
riots
through
full
sheepfolds
for
the
madness
of
hunger
urges
him
and
champs
and
rends
the
fleecy
flock
that
are
dumb
with
fear
and
roars
with
mouth
nor
less
is
the
slaughter
of
euryalus
he
too
rages
all
aflame
an
unnamed
multitude
go
down
before
his
path
and
fadus
and
herbesus
and
rhoetus
and
abaris
unaware
rhoetus
awake
and
seeing
all
but
he
hid
in
fear
behind
a
great
bowl
right
in
whose
breast
as
he
rose
close
by
he
plunged
the
sword
all
its
length
and
drew
it
back
heavy
with
death
he
vomits
forth
the
crimson
and
throws
up
wine
mixed
with
blood
in
the
death
agony
the
other
presses
hotly
on
his
stealthy
errand
and
now
bent
his
way
towards
messapus
comrades
where
he
saw
the
last
flicker
of
the
fires
go
down
and
the
horses
tethered
in
order
cropping
the
grass
when
nisus
briefly
speaks
thus
for
he
saw
him
carried
away
by
excess
of
murderous
desire
us
stop
for
unfriendly
daylight
draws
nigh
vengeance
is
sated
to
the
full
a
path
is
cut
through
the
enemy
much
they
leave
behind
men
armour
wrought
in
solid
silver
and
bowls
therewith
and
beautiful
carpets
euryalus
tears
away
the
decorations
of
rhamnes
and
his
embossed
with
gold
a
gift
which
caedicus
wealthiest
of
men
of
old
sends
to
remulus
of
tibur
when
plighting
friendship
far
away
he
on
his
gives
them
to
his
grandson
for
his
own
after
his
death
the
rutulians
captured
them
as
spoil
of
war
these
he
fits
on
the
shoulders
valiant
in
vain
then
puts
on
messapus
light
helmet
with
its
graceful
plumes
they
issue
from
the
camp
and
make
for
safety
meanwhile
an
advanced
guard
of
cavalry
were
on
their
way
from
the
latin
city
while
the
rest
of
their
marshalled
battalions
linger
on
the
plains
and
bore
a
reply
to
king
turnus
three
hundred
men
all
under
shield
in
volscens
leading
and
now
they
approached
the
camp
and
drew
near
the
wall
when
they
descry
the
two
turning
away
by
the
pathway
to
the
left
and
in
the
glimmering
darkness
of
night
the
forgotten
helmet
betrayed
euryalus
glittering
as
it
met
the
light
it
seemed
no
thing
of
chance
volscens
cries
aloud
from
his
column
men
why
on
the
march
or
how
are
you
in
arms
or
whither
hold
you
your
way
they
offer
nothing
in
reply
but
quicken
their
flight
into
the
forest
and
throw
themselves
on
the
night
on
this
side
and
that
the
horsemen
bar
the
familiar
crossways
and
encircle
every
outlet
with
sentinels
the
forest
spread
wide
in
tangled
thickets
and
dark
ilex
thick
growth
of
briars
choked
it
all
about
and
the
muffled
pathway
glimmered
in
a
broken
track
hampered
by
the
shadowy
boughs
and
his
cumbrous
spoil
euryalus
in
his
fright
misses
the
line
of
way
nisus
gets
clear
and
now
unthinkingly
he
had
passed
the
enemy
and
the
place
afterwards
called
albani
from
alba
name
then
the
deep
coverts
were
of
king
domain
when
he
stopped
and
looked
back
in
vain
for
his
lost
friend
unhappy
on
what
ground
have
i
left
thee
or
where
shall
i
follow
again
unwinding
all
the
entanglement
of
the
treacherous
woodland
way
therewith
he
marks
and
retraces
his
footsteps
and
wanders
down
the
silent
thickets
he
hears
the
horses
hears
the
clatter
and
of
the
pursuers
nor
had
he
long
to
wait
when
shouts
reach
his
ears
and
he
sees
euryalus
whom
even
now
in
the
perplexity
of
ground
and
darkness
the
whole
squadron
have
borne
down
in
a
sudden
rush
and
seize
in
spite
of
all
his
vain
struggles
what
shall
he
do
with
what
force
what
arms
dare
his
rescue
or
shall
he
rush
on
his
doom
amid
their
swords
and
find
in
their
wounds
a
speedy
and
glorious
death
quickly
he
draws
back
his
arm
with
poised
spear
and
looking
up
to
the
moon
on
high
utters
this
prayer
thou
give
present
aid
to
our
enterprise
o
latonian
goddess
glory
of
the
stars
and
guardian
of
the
woodlands
by
all
the
gifts
my
father
hyrtacus
ever
bore
for
my
sake
to
thine
altars
by
all
mine
own
hand
hath
added
from
my
hunting
or
hung
in
thy
dome
or
fixed
on
thy
holy
roof
grant
me
to
confound
these
masses
and
guide
my
javelin
through
the
air
he
ended
and
with
all
the
force
of
his
body
hurls
the
steel
the
flying
spear
whistles
through
the
darkness
of
the
night
and
comes
full
on
the
shield
of
sulmo
and
there
snaps
and
the
broken
shaft
passes
on
through
his
heart
spouting
a
warm
tide
from
his
breast
he
rolls
over
chill
in
death
and
his
sides
throb
with
gasps
hither
and
thither
they
gaze
round
lo
he
all
the
fiercer
was
poising
another
weapon
high
by
his
ear
while
they
hesitate
the
spear
went
whizzing
through
both
tagus
temples
and
pierced
and
stuck
fast
in
the
warm
brain
volscens
is
mad
with
rage
and
nowhere
espies
the
sender
of
the
weapon
nor
where
to
direct
his
fury
meanwhile
thy
warm
blood
shalt
pay
me
vengeance
for
both
he
cries
and
unsheathing
his
sword
he
made
at
euryalus
then
indeed
frantic
with
terror
nisus
shrieks
out
no
longer
could
he
shroud
himself
in
darkness
or
endure
such
agony
me
on
me
i
am
here
i
did
it
on
me
turn
your
steel
o
rutulians
mine
is
all
the
guilt
he
dared
not
no
nor
could
not
to
this
heaven
i
appeal
and
the
stars
that
know
he
only
loved
his
hapless
friend
too
well
such
words
he
was
uttering
but
the
sword
driven
hard
home
is
gone
clean
through
his
ribs
and
pierces
the
white
breast
euryalus
rolls
over
in
death
and
the
blood
runs
over
his
lovely
limbs
and
his
neck
sinks
and
settles
on
his
shoulder
even
as
when
a
lustrous
flower
cut
away
by
the
plough
droops
in
death
or
poppies
bow
down
their
head
if
overweighted
with
a
random
shower
but
nisus
rushes
amidst
them
and
alone
among
them
all
makes
at
volscens
keeps
to
volscens
alone
round
him
the
foe
cluster
and
on
this
side
and
that
hurl
him
back
none
the
less
he
presses
on
and
whirls
his
sword
like
lightning
till
he
plunges
it
full
in
the
face
of
the
shrieking
rutulian
and
slays
his
enemy
as
he
dies
then
stabbed
through
and
through
he
flung
himself
above
his
lifeless
friend
and
there
at
last
found
the
quiet
sleep
of
death
happy
pair
if
my
verse
is
aught
of
avail
no
length
of
days
shall
ever
blot
you
from
the
memory
of
time
while
the
house
of
aeneas
shall
dwell
by
the
capitoline
stedfast
stone
and
the
lord
of
rome
hold
sovereignty
the
victorious
rutulians
with
their
spoils
and
the
plunder
regained
bore
dead
volscens
weeping
to
the
camp
nor
in
the
camp
was
the
wailing
less
when
rhamnes
was
found
a
bloodless
corpse
and
serranus
and
numa
and
all
their
princes
destroyed
in
a
single
slaughter
crowds
throng
towards
the
corpses
and
the
men
wounded
to
death
the
ground
fresh
with
warm
slaughter
and
the
swoln
runlets
of
frothing
blood
they
mutually
recognise
the
spoils
messapus

and
the
decorations
that
cost
such

to
win
back

now

leaving
the

scattered
over

turnus

his

marshals
to

his

and

with

nay
pitiable
sight
they
fix
on
and
uprear
and
follow
with

shouts

by

alas
too
well
in
their
dark
dripping
gore
meanwhile
rumour
on
fluttering
wings
rushes
with
the
news
through
the
alarmed
town
and
glides
to
the
ears
of
euryalus
mother
but
instantly
the
warmth
leaves
her
woeful
body
the
shuttle
starts
from
her
hand
and
the
threads
unroll
she
darts
forth
in
agony
and
with
wailing
and
torn
hair
runs
distractedly
towards
the
walls
and
the
foremost
columns
recking
naught
of
men
naught
of
peril
or
weapons
thereon
she
fills
the
air
with
her
complaint
it
thus
i
behold
thee
o
euryalus
couldst
thou
the
latest
solace
of
mine
age
leave
me
alone
so
cruelly
nor
when
sent
into
such
danger
was
one
last
word
of
thee
allowed
thine
unhappy
mother
alas
thou
liest
in
a
strange
land
given
for
a
prey
to
the
dogs
and
fowls
of
latium
nor
was
i
thy
mother
there
for
chief
mourner
to
lay
thee
out
or
close
thine
eyes
or
wash
thy
wounds
and
cover
thee
with
the
garment
i
hastened
on
for
thee
whole
nights

an
anxious
old

thy

me
through

your
pity
on
me
cast
all
your

rutulians
make
me
the

or
do
thou
mighty

be
merciful
and
with
thine

hurl
this
hateful
life
to
the

deep

break
away
from

cruelty
at
this
weeping
cry
their
courage
falters
and
a
sigh
of
sorrow
passes
all
along
their

benumbed

broken
for

grief
kindled
at

and
weeping
iülus
bidding
idaeus

catch
up

in

but
the
terrible
afar
rang
on
the
shrill
brass
a
shout
follows
and
is
echoed
from
the
sky
the
volscians
hasten
up
in
even
line
under
their
advancing
roof
of
shields
and
set
to
fill
up
the
trenches
and
tear
down
the
palisades
some
seek
entrance
by
scaling
the
walls
with
ladders
where
the
defenders
is
thin
and
light
shows
through
gaps
in
the
ring
of

the
teucrians
in

shower

and
push
them
down
with

stones
so
be
they
may
break

crowded
under

bear
all
the
downpour

now
they
fail
for
where
the
vast
mass
presses
close
the
teucrians
roll
a
huge
block
tumbling
down
that
makes
a
wide
gap
in
the
rutulians
and
crashes
through
their
nor
do
the
bold
rutulians
care
longer
to
continue
the
blind
fight
but
strive
to
clear
the
rampart
with
missiles
elsewhere
in
dreadful
guise
mezentius

smoking

sent
down

this
all
the
italians
strove
with

strength
to
storm
and
set

and

to
overthrow
it
the
trojans
in
return
defended
it
with
stones
and
hurled
showers
of
darts
through

turnus
leading
the
attack
threw
a
blazing
torch
that
caught
flaming
on

swoln
by

seized
the

in

while
they
cluster
together
and

back

side

from

destroyer
the
tower
sinks
prone
under
the
sudden
weight
with
a
crash
that
thunders
through
all
the

pierced
by
their
own
weapons
and
impaled
on
hard
splinters
of
wood
they
come
half
slain
to

with
the
vast

scarcely

out
helenor
in
his
early
prime
whom
a
slave
woman
of

bore
in

to
the
maeonian
king
and
sent
to
troy
in
forbidden
weapons
lightly
armed
with
sheathless
sword

and
he
when
he
saw
himself
among

encircling
thousands
ranks
on

on

of

as
a
wild
beast
which
girt
with

crowded
ring
of
hunters
dashes
at
their
weapons
hurls
herself
unblinded
on
death
and
comes
with
a
bound
upon
the
spears
even
so
he
rushes
to
his
death
amid
the
enemy
and
presses
on
where
he
sees
their
weapons
thickest
but
lycus
far
fleeter
of

holds
by

cleaving
the

ascanius
then
he
changes
the
fashion
of
his
countenance
and
becomes
aged

of

to
dardanian
anchises
and
the
faithful

of

thereafter
his

gave
him

apollo
came
voice

colour
white
hair
and
grimly
clashing
arms
and
speaks
these
words
to
eager
iülus
it
enough
son
of
aeneas
that
the
numanian
hath
fallen
unavenged
beneath
thine
arrows
this

great
apollo
allows
thee
nor

that

alone
thus
apollo
began
and
yet
speaking
retreated
from
mortal
view
vanishing
into
thin
air
away
out
of
their
eyes
the
dardanian
princes
knew
the
god
and
the
arms
of
deity
and
heard
the
clash
of
his
quiver
as
he
went
so
they
restrain
ascanius
keenness
for
battle
by
the
words
of
will
themselves
they
again
close
in

cast
their
lives
into
the
perilous
breach

dangles

the

scatter

forthwith
taken

to
burst

and
let

at

that
had
been
the

rage

thirst
of
slaughter
drive
him

catches
up

gyges

a

of

meets
him
the
nymphs
whom
bountiful
cybele
had
bidden
be
gods
of

and
turn
to

from

they
swam
on
in

and
cleft

as
many
as
erewhile

had
anchored
on

from

they
know

and
wheel

thus
accosts

amazed
lord
thou
seed
of

aeneas
wake
and
loosen
the
sheets
of
thy
sails
we
are
thy
fleet
idaean
pines
from
the
holy
hill
now
nymphs
of
the
sea
when
the
treacherous
rutulian
urged
us
headlong
with
sword
and
fire
unwillingly
we
broke
thy
bonds
and
we
search
for
thee
over
ocean
this
new
guise
our
lady
made
for
us
in
pity
and
granted
us
to
be
goddesses
and
spend
our

under

but
thy
boy
ascanius
is
held
within
wall
and
trench
among
the
latin
weapons
and
the
rough
edge
of
war
already
the
arcadian
cavalry
and
the
brave
etruscan
together
hold
the
appointed
ground
turnus
plan
is
fixed
to
bar
their
way
with
his
squadrons
that
they
may
not
reach
the
camp
up
and
arise
and
ere
the
coming
of
the
dawn
bid
thy
crews
be
called
to
arms
and
take
thou
the
shield
which
the
lord
of

forged
for
victory
and
rimmed
about
with
gold
daylight
if
thou
deem
not
my
words
vain
shall
see
rutulians
heaped
high
in
slaughter
she
ended
and
as
she
went
pushed
the
tall
ship
on
with
her
hand
wisely
and
well
the
ship
shoots
through
the
water
fleeter
than
javelin
or
windswift
arrow
thereat
the
rest
quicken
their
speed
the
son
of
anchises
of
troy
is
himself
deep
in
bewilderment
yet
the
omen
cheers
his
courage
then
looking
on
the
heavenly
vault
he
briefly
prays
gracious
upon
ida
mother
of
gods
whose
delight
is
in
dindymus
and
turreted
cities
and
lions
coupled
to
thy
rein
do
thou
lead
me
in
battle
do
thou
meetly
prosper
thine
augury
and
draw
nigh
thy
phrygians
goddess
with
favourable
feet
thus
much
he
spoke
and
meanwhile
the
broad
light
of
returning
day
now
began
to
pour
in
and
chased
away
the
night
first
he
commands
his
comrades
to
follow
his
signals
brace
their
courage
to
arms
and
prepare
for
battle
and
now
his
trojans
and
his
camp
are
in
his
sight
as
he
stands
high
astern
when
next
he
lifts
the
blazing
shield
on
his
left
arm
the
dardanians
on
the
walls
raise
a
shout
to
the
sky
hope
comes
to
kindle
wrath
they
hurl
their
missiles
strongly
even
as
under
black
clouds
cranes
from
the
strymon
utter
their
signal
notes
and
sail
clamouring
across
the
sky
and
noisily
stream
down
the
gale
but
this
seemed
marvellous
to
the
rutulian
king
and
the
captains
of
ausonia
till
looking
back
they
see
the
ships
steering
for
the
beach
and
all
the
sea
as
a
single
fleet
sailing
in
his
blazes
flame
pours
from
the
cresting
plumes
and
the
golden
spouts
floods
of
fire
even
as
when
in
transparent
night
comets
glow
and
drear
or
the
splendour
of
sirius
that
brings
drought
and
sicknesses
on
wretched
men
rises
and
saddens
the
sky
with
malignant
beams
yet
gallant
turnus
in
unfailing
confidence
will
prevent
them
on
the
shore
and
repel
their
approach
to
land
your
prayers
have
sought
is
given
the
sweep
of
the
the
god
of
battles
is
in
the
hands
of
men
now
remember
each
his
wife
and
home
now
recall
the
high
deeds
of
our
fathers
honour
let
us
challenge
meeting
at
the
water
edge
while
they
waver
and
their
feet
yet
slip
as
they
disembark
fortune
aids
daring
so
speaks
he
and
counsels
inly
whom
he
shall
lead
to
meet
them
whom
leave
in
charge
of
the
leaguered
walls
meanwhile
aeneas
lands
his
allies
by
gangways
from
the
high
ships
many
watch
the
retreat
and
slack
of
the
sea
and
leap
boldly
into
the
shoal
water
others
slide
down
the
oars
tarchon
marking
the
shore
where
the
shallows
do
not
seethe
and
plash
with
broken
water
but
the
sea
glides
up
and
spreads
its
tide
unbroken
suddenly
turns
his
bows
to
land
and
implores
his
comrades
o
chosen
crew
bend
strongly
to
your
oars
lift
your
ships
make
them
go
let
the
prows
cleave
this
hostile
land
and
the

plough
herself
a

i
will
let
my
vessel
break
up
on
such
harbourage
if
once
she
takes
the
land
when
tarchon
had
spoken
in
such
wise
his
comrades
rise
on
their
and
carry
their
ships
in
foam
towards
the
latin
fields
till
the
prows
are
fast
on
dry
land
and
all
the
keels
are
aground
unhurt
but
not
thy

tarchon
for
she
dashes
on
a
shoal
and
swings
long
swaying
on
the
cruel
bank
pitching
and
slapping
the

then
breaks
up
and
lands
her
crew
among
the
waves
broken

and
floating
thwarts
entangle
them
and
the
ebbing
wave
sucks
their
feet
away
nor
does
turnus
keep
idly
dallying
but
swiftly
hurries
his
whole
array
against
the
trojans
and
ranges
it
to
face
the

the
trumpets
blow
at
once
aeneas

and
confounds
the
rustic

of
the

for

the

advances
to
challenge
aeneas
but
through

plates
of

rough
with

the

plunges
in

the
enemy
where
yonder
mass
of
men
presses
thickest
there
your
proud
country
calls
you
with
pallas
at
your
head
no
gods
are
they
who
bear
us
down
mortals
we
feel
the
pressure
of
a
mortal
foe
we
have
as
many
lives
and
hands
as
he
lo
the
deep
shuts
us
in
with
vast
sea
barrier
even
now
land
fails
our
flight
shall
we
make
ocean
or
troy
our
goal
so
speaks
he
and
bursts
amid
the
serried
foe
first
lagus
meets
him
drawn
thither
by
malign
destiny
him
as
he
tugs
at
a
ponderous
stone
hurling
his
spear
where
the
spine
ran
dissevering
the
ribs
he
pierces
and
wrenches
out
the
spear
where
it
stuck
fast
in
the
bone
nor
does
hisbo
catch
him
stooping
for
all
that
he
hoped
it
for
pallas
as
he
rushes
unguarded
on
furious
at
his
comrade
cruel
death
receives
him
on
his
sword
and
buries
it
in
his
distended
lungs
next
he
attacks
sthenius
and
anchemolus
of
rhoetus
ancient
family
who
dared
to
violate
the
bridal
chamber
of
his
stepmother
you
too
the
twins
larides
and
thymber
fell
on
the
rutulian
fields
children
of
daucus
indistinguishable
for
likeness
and
a
sweet
perplexity
to
your
parents
but
now
pallas
made
cruel
difference
between
you
for
thy
head
thymber
is
swept
off
by
evander
sword
thy
right
hand
larides
severed
seeks
its
master
and
the
dying
fingers
jerk
and
clutch
at
the
sword
fired
by
his
encouragement
and
beholding
his
noble
deeds
the
arcadians
advance
in
wrath
and
shame
to
meet
the
enemy
in
arms
then
pallas
pierces
rhoeteus
as
he
flies
past
in
his
chariot
this
space
this
much
of
respite
was
given
to
ilus
for
at
ilus
he
had
aimed
the
strong
spear
from
afar
and
rhoeteus
intercepts
its
passage
in
flight
from
thee
noble
teuthras
and
tyres
thy
brother
he
rolls
from
the
chariot
in
death
and
his
heels
strike
the
rutulian
fields
and
as
the
shepherd
when
summer
winds
have
risen
to
his
desire
kindles
the
woods
dispersedly
on
a
sudden
the
mid
spaces
catch
and
a
single
flickering
line
of
fire
spreads
wide
over
the
plain
he
sits
looking
down
on
his
conquest
and
the
revel
of
the
flames
even
so
pallas
do
thy
brave
comrades
gather
close
to
sustain
thee
but
warrior
halesus
advances
full
on
them
gathering
himself
behind
his
armour
he
slays
ladon
pheres
demodocus
his
gleaming
sword
shears
off
strymonius
hand
as
it
rises
to
his
throat
he
strikes
thoas
on
the
face
with
a
stone
and
drives
the
bones
asunder
in
a
shattered
mass
of
blood
and
brains
halesus
had
his
father
the
soothsayer
kept
hidden
in
the
woodland
when
the
old
man
glazing
eyes
sank
to
death
the
fates
laid
hand
on
him
and
devoted
him
to
the
arms
of
evander
pallas
aims
at
him
first
praying
thus
now
lord
tiber
to
the
steel
i
poise
and
hurl
a
prosperous
way
through
brawny
halesus
breast
thine
oak
shall
bear
these

and
the

he
wore
the
god
heard
it
while
halesus
covers
imaon
he
leaves
alas
his
breast
unarmed
to
the

yet
at
his
grievous
death
lausus
himself
a
great
arm
of
the
war
lets
not
his
columns
be
dismayed
at
once
he
meets
and
cuts
down
abas
the
check
and
stay
of
their
battle
the
men
of
arcadia
go
down
before
him
down
go
the
etruscans
and
you
o
teucrians
invincible
by
greece
the
armies
close
matched
in
strength
and
in
captains
the
rear
ranks
crowd
in
weapons
and
hands
are
locked
in
the
press
here
pallas
strains
and
pushes
on
here
lausus
opposite
nearly
matched
in
age
excellent
in
beauty
but
fortune
had
denied
both
return
to
their
own
land
yet
that
they
should
meet
face
to
face
the
sovereign
of
high
olympus
allowed
not
an
early
fate
awaits
them
beneath
a
mightier
foe
meanwhile
turnus
gracious
sister
bids
him
take
lausus
room
and
his
fleet
chariot
parts
the
ranks
when
he
saw
his
comrades
is
time
he
cried
stay
from
battle
i
alone
must
assail
pallas
to
me
and
none
other
pallas
is
due
i
would
his
father
himself
were
here
to
see
so
speaks
he
and
his
rutulians
draw
back
from
a
level
space
at
his
bidding
but
then
as
they
withdrew
he
wondering
at
the
haughty
command
stands
in
amaze
at
turnus
his
eyes
scanning
the
vast
frame
and
his
fierce
glance
perusing
him
from
afar
and
with
these
words
he
returns
the
words
of
the
monarch
me
my
praise
shall
even
now
be
in
the
lordly
spoils
i
win
or
in
illustrious
death
my
father
will
bear
calmly
either
lot
away
with
menaces
he
speaks
and
advances
into
the
level
ring
the
arcadians
blood
gathers
chill
about
their
hearts
turnus
leaps
from
his
chariot
and
prepares
to
close
with
him
and
as
a
lion
sees
from
some
lofty
outlook
a
bull
stand
far
off
on
the
plain
revolving
battle
and
flies
at
him
even
such
to
see
is
turnus
coming
when
pallas
deemed
him
within
reach
of
a
he
advances
if
so
chance
may
assist
the
daring
of
his
overmatched
strength
and
thus
cries
into
the
depth
of
sky
my
father
hospitality
and
the
board
whereto
thou
camest
a
wanderer
on
thee
i
call
alcides
be
favourable
to
my
high
emprise
let
turnus
even
in
death
discern
me
stripping
his
armour
and
his
swooning
eyes
endure
the
sight
of
his
conqueror
alcides
heard
him
and
deep
in
his
heart
he
stifled
a
heavy
sigh
and
let
idle
tears
fall
then
with
kindly
words
the
father
accosts
his
son
hath
his
own
appointed
day
short
and
irrecoverable
is
the
span
of
life
for
all
but
to
spread
renown
by
deeds
is
the
task
of
valour
under
high
troy
town
many
and
many
a
god
son
fell
nay
mine
own
child
sarpedon
likewise
perished
turnus
too
his
own
fate
summons
and
his
allotted
period
hath
reached
the
goal
so
speaks
he
and
turns
his
eyes
away
from
the
rutulian
fields
but
pallas
hurls
his
spear
with
all
his
strength
and
pulls
his
sword
flashing
out
of
the
hollow
scabbard
the
flying
spear
lights
where
the
armour
rises
high
above
the
shoulder
and
forcing
a
way
through
the
shield
rim
ceased
not
till
it
drew
blood
from
mighty
turnus
at
this
turnus
long
poises
the
with
its
sharp
steel
head
and
hurls
it
on
pallas
with
these
words
thou
if
our
weapon
have
not
a
keener
he
ended
but
for
all
the
shield
plating
of
iron
and
brass
for
all
the
that
covers
it
round
about
the
quivering
smashes
it
fair
through
and
through
passes
the
guard
of
the
corslet
and
pierces
the
breast
with
a
gaping
hole
he
tears
the
warm
weapon
from
the
wound
in
vain
together
and
at
once
and
sense
follow
it
he
falls
heavily
on
the
ground
his
armour
clashes
over
him
and
his
bloodstained
face
sinks
in
death
on
the
hostile
soil
and
turnus
standing
over
him
he
cries
these
my
words
and
bear
them
to
evander
i
send
him
back
his
pallas
as
was
due
all
the
meed
of
the
tomb
all
the
solace
of
sepulture
i
give
freely
dearly
must
he
pay
his
welcome
to
aeneas
and
with
these
words
planting
his
left
foot
on
the
dead
he
tore
away
the
broad
heavy
engraven
with
a
tale
of
crime
the
array
of
grooms
foully
slain
together
on
their
bridal
night
and
the
nuptial
chambers
dabbled
with
blood
which
clonus
son
of
eurytus
had
wrought
richly
in
gold
now
turnus
exults
in
spoiling
him
of
it
and
rejoices
at
his
prize
ah
spirit
of
man
ignorant
of
fate
and
the
allotted
future
or
to
keep
bounds
when
elate
with
prosperity
the
day
will
come
when
turnus
shall
desire
to
have
bought
pallas
safety
at
a
great
ransom
and
curse
the
spoils
of
this
fatal
day
but
with
many
moans
and
tears
pallas
comrades
lay
him
on
his
shield
and
bear
him
away
amid
their
ranks
o
grief
and
glory
and
grace
of
the
father
to
whom
thou
shalt
return
this
one
day
sent
thee
first
to
war
this
one
day
takes
thee
away
while
yet
thou
leavest
heaped
high
thy
rutulian
dead
and
now
no
rumour
of
the
dreadful
loss
but
a
surer
messenger
flies
to
aeneas
telling
him
his
troops
are
on
the
thin
edge
of
doom
it
is
time
to
succour
the
routed
teucrians
he
mows
down
all
that
meets
him
and
hews
a
broad
path
through
their
columns
with
furious
sword
as
he
seeks
thee
o
turnus
in
thy
fresh
pride
of
slaughter
pallas
evander
all
flash
before
his
eyes
the
board
whereto
but
then
he
had
first
come
a
wanderer
and
the
clasped
hands
here
four
of
sulmo
children
as
many
more
of
ufens
nurture
are
taken
by
him
alive
to
slaughter
in
sacrifice
to
the
shade
below
and
slake
the
flames
of
the
pyre
with
captive
blood
next
he
levelled
his
spear
full
on
magus
from
far
he
stoops
cunningly
the
spear
flies
quivering
over
him
and
clasping
his
knees
he
speaks
thus
beseechingly
thy
father
ghost
by
iülus
thy
growing
hope
i
entreat
thee
save
this
life
for
a
child
and
a
parent
my
house
is
stately
deep
in
it
lies
buried
wealth
of
engraven
silver
i
have
masses
of
wrought
and
unwrought
gold
the
victory
of
troy
does
not
turn
on
this
nor
will
a
single
life
make
so
great
a
difference
he
ended
to
him
aeneas
thus
returns
answer
the
wealth
of
silver
and
gold
thou
tellest
of
spare
thou
for
thy
children
turnus
hath
broken
off
this
thy
trafficking
in

even
then
when
pallas
fell
thus
judges
the
ghost
of
my
father
anchises
thus
iülus
so
speaking
he
grasps
his
helmet
with
his
left
hand
and
bending
back
his
neck
drives
his
sword
up
to
the
hilt
in
the
suppliant

priest
of

and
trivia
his
temples
wound
with
the
holy
ribboned
chaplet
all
glittering
in
array
him
he
meets
and
chases
down
the
plain
and
standing
over
his
fallen
foe
slaughters
him
and
wraps
him
in
great
darkness
serestus
gathers
the

and
carries
it
away
on

who

the

rushes
full
on

his
sword
had
hewn
off
anxur
left
arm
with
all
the
circle
of
the
shield
he
had
uttered
brave
words
and
deemed
his
prowess
would
second
his
vaunts
and
perchance
with
spirit
lifted
up
had
promised
himself
hoar
age
and
length
of
years
when
tarquitus
in
the
pride
of
his
glittering
arms
met
his
fiery
course
whom
the
nymph
dryope
had
borne
to
faunus
haunter
of
the
woodland
drawing
back
his
spear
he
pins
the
ponderous
shield
to
the
corslet
then
as
he
vainly
pleaded
and
would
say
many
a
thing
strikes
his
head
to
the
ground
and
rolling
away
the
warm
body
cries
thus
over
his
enemy
there
now
terrible
one
no
mother
love
shall
lay
thee
in
the
sod
or
place
thy
limbs
beneath
thine
heavy
ancestral
tomb
to

of
prey
shalt
thou
be
left
or
borne
down
sunk
in
the
eddying
water
where
hungry
fish
shall
suck
thy
wounds
next
he
sweeps
on
antaeus
and
lucas
the
first
of
train
and
brave
numa
and
camers
born
of
noble
volscens
who
was
wealthiest
in

of
the
ausonians
and
reigned
in
silent
amyclae
even
as
aegaeon
who
men
say
had
an
hundred
arms
an
hundred
hands
fifty
mouths
and
breasts
ablaze
with
fire
and
arrayed
against
jove
thunders
as
many
clashing
shields
and
drawn
swords
so
aeneas
when
once
his
sword
point
grew
warm
rages
victorious
over
all
the
field
nay
lo
he
darts
full
in
face
on
niphaeus
chariot
before
his
long
strides
and
dreadful
cry
they
turned
in
terror
and
dashed
back
throwing
out
their
driver
and
tearing
the
chariot
down
the
beach
meanwhile
the
brothers
lucagus
and
liger
drive
up
with
their
pair
of
white
horses
lucagus
valiantly
waves
his
drawn
sword
while
his
brother
wheels
his
horses
with
the
rein
aeneas
wrathful
at
their
mad
onslaught
rushes
on
them
towering
high
with
levelled
spear
to
him
liger
diomede
horses
dost
thou
discern
nor
chariot
nor
the
plains
of
phrygia
now
on
this
soil
of
ours
the
war
and
thy
life
shall
end
together
thus
fly
mad
liger
random
words
but
not
in
words
does
the
trojan
hero
frame
his
reply
for
he
hurls
his
javelin
at
the
foe
as
lucagus
spurred
on
his
horses
bending
forward
over
the
whip
with
left
foot
advanced
ready
for
battle
the
spear
passes
through
the
lower
rim
of
his
shining
shield
and
pierces
his
left
groin
knocks
him
out
of
the
chariot
and
stretches
him
in
death
on
the
fields
to
him
good
aeneas
speaks
in
bitter
words
no
slackness
in
thy
coursers
flight
hath
betrayed
thee
or
vain
shadow
of
the
foe
turned
them
back
thyself
thou
leapest
off
the
harnessed
wheels
in
such
wise
he
spoke
and
caught
the
horses
his
brother
slipping
down
from
the
chariot
pitiably
outstretched
helpless
hands
by
the
parents
who
gave
thee
birth
great
trojan
spare
this
life
and
pity
my
prayer
more
he
was
pleading
but
aeneas
such
were
the
words
thou
wert
uttering
die
and
be
brother
undivided
from
brother
with
that
his
sword
point
pierces
the
breast
where
the
life
lies
hid
thus
the
dardanian
captain
dealt
death
over
the
plain
like
some
raging
torrent
stream
or
black
whirlwind
at
last
the
boy
ascanius
and
his
troops
burst
through
the
ineffectual
leaguer
and
issue
from
the
camp
meanwhile
jupiter
breaks
silence
to
accost
juno
sister
and
wife
best
beloved
it
is
venus
as
thou
deemedst
nor
is
thy
judgment
astray
who
sustains
the
forces
of
troy
not
their
own
valour
of
hand
in
war
and
untamable
spirit
and
endurance
in
peril
to
whom
juno
beseechingly
fair
my
lord
vexest
thou
one
sick
at
heart
and
trembling
at
thy
bitter
words
if
that
force
were
in
my
love
that
once
was
and
that
was
well
never
had
thine
omnipotence
denied
me
leave
to
withdraw
turnus
from
battle
and
preserve
him
for
his
father
daunus
in
safety
now
let
him
perish
and
pay
forfeit
to
the
trojans
of
his
innocent
blood
yet
he
traces
his
birth
from
our
name
and
pilumnus
was
his
father
in
the
fourth
generation
and
oft
and
again
his
bountiful
hand
hath
heaped
thy
courts
with
gifts
to
her
the
king
of
high
heaven
thus
briefly
spoke
thy
prayer
for
him
is
delay
of
present
death
and
respite
from
his
fall
and
thou
dost
understand
that
i
ordain
it
thus
remove
thy
turnus
in
flight
and
snatch
him
from
the
fate
that
is
upon
him
for
so
much
indulgence
there
is
room
but
if
any
ampler
grace
mask
itself
in
these
thy
prayers
and
thou
dreamest
of
change
in
the
whole
movement
of
the
war
idle
is
the
hope
thou
nursest
and
juno
weeping
yet
if
thy
mind
were
gracious
where
thy
lips
are
stern
and
this
gift
of
life
might
remain
confirmed
to
turnus
now
his
portion
is
bitter
and
guiltless
death
or
i
wander
idly
from
the
truth
yet
oh
that
i
rather
deluded
myself
with
false
alarms
and
thou
who
canst
wouldst
bend
thy
course
to
better
counsels
these
words
uttered
she
darted
through
the
air
straight
from
high
heaven
in
driving
tempest
and
sought
the
ilian
ranks
and
camp
of
laurentum
then
the
goddess
strange
and
ominous
to
see
fashions
into
the
likeness
of
aeneas
a
thin
and
pithless
shade
of
hollow
mist
decks
it
with
dardanian
weapons
and
gives
it
the
mimicry
of
shield
and
divine

hastens
up
and

it

thou

forsake
not

plighted

this

shall
give
thee

he
pursues
and
brandishes
his
drawn

and
sees
not

is
drifting
with

haply
moored
to

itself
nor

to

overleaps

parted

and
him
aeneas
seeks
for

flitting
aloft
melts
in

comes
down

sweeps
turnus
through

looks

of

thankless
for

wailing
stretches
both

where
no

thus
speaking
he
wavers

that
maddened
by

shall
he
plunge
on

drive
it
through

himself
among

by

for

and
even
as

he
caught
up

in

and

on

with

beyond

thine

but
none

rises

in
the

captain
and
the

pass

last
threads
through

for

drives
the
sword
strongly
right
through

up
all
its

the
light
shield
that
armed
his
assailant
and
the
tunic
sewn
by
his

with
flexible
gold
blood
filled
his
breast
and
the
life
left
the
body
and
passed
mourning
through
the
air
to
the
under
world
but
when
anchises
son
saw
the
look
on
the
dying
face
the
face
pale
in
wonderful
wise
he
sighed
deeply
in
pity
and
reached
forth
his
hand
as
the
likeness
of
his
own
filial
affection
flashed
across
his
soul
now
shall
good
aeneas
give
thee
what
o
poor
boy
for
this
thy
praise
for
guerdon
of
a
nature
so
noble
keep
for
thine
own
the
armour
thou
didst
delight
in
and
i
restore
thee
if
that
matters
aught
at
all
to
the
ghosts
and
ashes
of
thy
parents
yet
thou
shalt
have
this
sad
comfort
in
thy
piteous
death
thou
fallest
by
great
aeneas
hand
then
chiding
his
hesitating
comrades
he
lifts
him
from
the
ground
dabbling
the
tresses
with
blood
meanwhile
his
father
by
the
wave
of
the
tiber
river
stanched
his
wound
with
water
and
rested
his
body
against
a
hard
by
his
brazen
helmet
hangs
from
the
boughs
and
the
heavy
armour
lies
quietly
on
the
meadow
chosen
men
stand
round
he
sick
and
panting
leans
his
neck
and
lets
his
beard
spread
down
over
his
chest
many
a
time
he
asks
for
lausus
and
sends
many
an
one
to
call
him
back
and
carry
a
parent
sad
commands
but
lausus
his
weeping
comrades
were
bearing
lifeless
on
his
armour
mighty
and
mightily
wounded
to
death
afar
the
soul
prophetic
of

their
lamentation
he
soils
his
gray
hairs
plenteously
with
dust
and
stretches
both
hands
on
high
and
clings
on
the
dead
life
hold
on
me
so
sweet
o
my
son
that
i
let

i

receive
the
hostile
stroke
in

am
i
thy
father
saved
by
these
wounds
of
thine
and
living
by
thy
death
alas
and
woe
now
at
last
exile
is
bitter
now
the
wound
is
driven
deep
and
i
even
i
o
my
son
stained
thy
name
with
crime
driven
in
hatred
from
the
throne
and
sceptre
of
my
fathers
i
owed
vengeance
to
my
country
and
my
resentment
might
mine
own
guilty
life
but
have
paid
it
by
every
form
of
death
now
i
live
and
leave
not
yet
man
and
day
but
i
will
as
he
speaks
thus
he
raises
himself
painfully
on
his
thigh
and
though
the
violence
of
the
deep
wound
cripples
him
yet
unbroken
he
bids
his
horse
be
brought
his
beauty
his
comfort
that
ever
had
carried
him
victorious
out
of
war
and
says
these
words
to
the
grieving
beast
we
have
lived
long
if
aught
at
all
lasts
long
with
mortals
this
day
wilt
thou
either
bring
back
in
triumph
the
gory
head
and
spoils
of
aeneas
and
we
will
avenge
lausus
agonies
or
if
no
force
opens
a
way
thou
wilt
die
with
me
for
i
deem
not
bravest
thou
wilt
deign
to
bear
an
alien
rule
and
a
teucrian
lord
he
spoke
and
took
his
welcome
seat
on
the
back
he
knew
loading
both
hands
with
keen
javelins
his
head
sheathed
in
glittering
brass
and
shaggy
plumes
thus
he
galloped
in
through
his
heart
sweep
together
the
vast
tides
of
shame
and
mingling
madness
and
grief
and
with
that
he
thrice

aeneas

the

makes
glad

the

speed

so

thou
essay

thus

utters
and
moves
up
to

him
with

and

now
my

this

nor

before
any
of
thy

for
i
come
to
my
death
first
carrying
these
gifts
for
thee
he
spoke
and
hurled
a

at
his
enemy
then
plants
another
and
yet
another
as
he
darts
round
in
a
wide

but
they
are

on

he
rode

close

sent
his

with

now
at

he
bursts
forth
and

the

raises

beating

council
of
the
latins
and
the
life
and
death
of
camilla
meanwhile
dawn
arose
forth
of
ocean
aeneas
though
the
charge
presses
to
give
a
space
for
burial
of
his
comrades
and
his
mind
is
in
the
tumult
of
death
began
to
pay
the
gods
his
vows
of
victory
with
the
breaking
of
the
east
he
plants
on
a
mound
a
mighty
oak
with
boughs
lopped
away
on
every
hand
and
arrays
it
in
the
gleaming
arms
stripped
from
mezentius
the
captain
a
trophy
to
thee
mighty
lord
of
war
he
fixes
on
it
the
plumes
dripping
with
blood
the
broken
spears
and
the
corslet
struck
and
pierced
in
twelve
places
he
ties
the
shield
of
brass
on
his
left
hand
and
hangs
from
his
neck
the
ivory
sword
then
among
his
joyous
comrades
for
all
the
throng
of
his
captains
girt
him
close
about
he
begins
in
these
words
of
cheer
greatest
deed
is
done
o
men
be
all
fear
gone
for
what
remains
these
are
the
spoils
of
a
haughty
king
the
won
from
him
my
hands
have
set
mezentius
here
now
our
way
lies
to
the
walls
of
the
latin
king
prepare
your
arms
in
courage
and
let
your
hopes
anticipate
the
war
let
no
ignorant
delay
hinder
or
tardy
thoughts
of
fear
keep
us
back
so
soon
as
heaven
grant
us
to
pluck
up
the
standards
and
lead
our
army
from
the
camp
meanwhile
let
us
commit
to
earth
the
unburied
bodies
of
our
comrades
since
deep
in
acheron
this
honour
is
left
alone
go
says
he
with
the
last
gifts
those
noble
souls
whose
blood
won
us
this
land
for
ours
and
first
let
pallas
be
sent
to
evander
mourning
city
he
whose
valour
failed
not
when
the
day
of
darkness
took
him
and
the
bitter
wave
of
death
so
speaks
he
weeping
and
retraces
his
steps
to
the
door
where
aged
acoetes
watched
pallas
lifeless
body
laid
out
for
burial
once
to
evander
in
parrhasia
but
now
gone
forth
with
darker
omens
appointed
attendant
to
his
darling
around
is
the
whole
train
of
servants
with
a
crowd
of
trojans
and
the
ilian
women
with
hair
unbound
in
mourning
after
their
fashion
when
aeneas
entered
at
the
high
doorway
they
beat
their
breasts
and
raise
a
loud
wail
aloft
and
the
palace
moans
to
their
grievous
lamentation
himself
when
he
saw
the
pillowed
head
and
fair
face
of
pallas
and
on
his
smooth
breast
the
gaping
wound
of
the
ausonian
speaks
thus
with
welling
tears
fortune
in
her
joyous
coming
he
cries
luckless
boy
grudge
thee
the
sight
of
our
realm
and
a
triumphal
entry
to
thy
dwelling
not
this
promise
of
thee
had
i
given
to
evander
thy
sire
at
my
departure
when
he
embraced
me
as
i
went
and
bade
me
speed
to
a
wide
empire
and
yet
warned
me
in
fear
that
the
men
were
valiant
the
people
obstinate
in
battle
and
now
he
fast
ensnared
by
empty
hope
perchance
offers
vows
and
heaps
gifts
on
his
altars
we
a
mourning
train
go
in
hollow
honour
by
his
corpse
who
now
owes
no
more
to
aught
in
heaven
unhappy
thou
wilt
see
thy
son
cruelly
slain
is
this
our
triumphal
return
awaited
is
this
my
strong
assurance
ah
me
what
a
shield
is
lost
mine
iülus
to
ausonia
and
to
thee
this
lament
done
he
bids
raise
the
piteous
body
and
sends
a
thousand
men
chosen
from
all
his
army
for
the
last
honour
of
escort
to
mingle
in
the
father
tears
a
small
comfort
in
a
great
sorrow
yet
the
unhappy
parent
due
others
quickly
plait
a
soft
wicker
bier
of
arbutus
rods
and
oak
shoots
and
shadow
the
heaped
pillows
with
a
leafy
covering
here
they
lay
him
high
on
their
rustic
strewing
even
as
some
tender
violet
or
drooping
plucked
by
a
maiden
finger
whose
sheen
and
whose
grace
is
not
yet
departed
but
no
more
does
earth
the
mother
feed
it
or
lend
it
strength
then
aeneas
bore
forth
two
purple
garments
stiff
with
gold
that
sidonian
dido
own
hands
happy
over
their
work
had
once
wrought
for
him
and
shot
the
warp
with
delicate
gold
one
of
these
he
sadly
folds
round
him
a
last
honour
and
veils
in
its
covering
the
tresses
destined
to
the
fire
and
heaps
up
besides
many
a
laurentine
and
bids
his
spoils
pass
forth
in
long
train
with
them
the
horses
and
arms
whereof
he
had
stripped
the
enemy
and
those
with
hands
tied
behind
their
back
whom
he
would
send
as
nether
offering
to
his
ghost
and
sprinkle
the
blood
of
their
slaying
on
the
flame
also
he
bids
his
captains
carry
stems
dressed
in
the
armour
of
the
foe
and
fix
on
them
the
hostile
names
unhappy
acoetes
is
led
along
outworn
with
age
he
smites
his
breast
and
rends
his
face
and
flings
himself
forward
all
along
the
ground
likewise
they
lead
forth
the
chariot
bathed
in
rutulian
blood
behind
goes
weeping
aethon
the
his
trappings
laid
away
and
big
drops
wet
his
face
others
bear
his
spear
and
helmet
for
all
else
is
turnus
prize
then
follow
in
mourning
array
the
teucrians
and
all
the
tyrrhenians
and
the
arcadians
with
arms
reversed
when
the
whole
long
escorting
file
had
taken
its
way
aeneas
stopped
and
sighing
deep
pursued
thus
again
war
dreadful
destiny
calls
us
hence
to
other
tears
hail
thou
for
evermore
o
princely
pallas
and
for
evermore
farewell
and
without
more
words
he
bent
his
way
to
the
high
walls
and
advanced
towards
his
camp
and
now
envoys
were
there
from
the
latin
city
with
wreathed
boughs
of
olive
praying
him
of
his
grace
to
restore
the
dead
that
lay
strewn
by
the
sword
over
the
plain
and
let
them
go
to
their
earthy
grave
no
war
lasts
with
men
conquered
and
bereft
of
breath
let
this
indulgence
be
given
to
men
once
called
friends
and
fathers
of
their
brides
to
them
aeneas
grants
leave
in
kind
and
courteous
wise
spurning
not
their
prayer
and
goes
on
in
these
words
spite
of
fortune
o
latins
hath
entangled
you
in
the
toils
of
war
and
made
you
fly
our
friendship
plead
you
for
peace
to
the
lifeless
bodies
that
the
hath
slain
i
would
fain
grant
it
even
to
the
living
neither
have
i
come
but
because
destiny
had
given
me
this
place
to
dwell
in
nor
wage
i
war
with
your
people
your
king
it
is
who
hath
broken
our
covenant
and
preferred
to
trust
himself
to
turnus
arms
fitter
it
were
turnus
had
faced
death
if
he
will
fight
out
the
war
and
expel
the
teucrians
it
had
been
well
to
meet
me
here
in
arms
so
had
he
lived
to
whom
life
were
granted
of
heaven
or
his
own
right
hand
now
go
and
kindle
the
fire
beneath
your
hapless
countrymen
aeneas
ended
they
stood
dumb
in
silence
with
faces
bent
steadfastly
in
mutual
gaze
then
aged
drances
ever
young
turnus
assailant
in
hatred
and
accusation
with
the
words
of
his
mouth
thus
answers
him
again
trojan
great
in
renown
yet
greater
in
arms
with
what
praises
may
i
extol
thy
divine
goodness
shall
thy
righteousness
first
wake
my
wonder
or
thy
toils
in
war
we
indeed
will
gratefully
carry
these
words
to
our
fathers
city
and
if
fortune
grant
a
way
will
make
thee
at
one
with
king
latinus
let
turnus
seek
his
own
alliances
nay
it
will
be
our
delight
to
rear
the
massy
walls
of
destiny
and
stoop
our
shoulders
under
the
stones
of
troy
he
ended
thus
and
all
with
one
voice
murmured
assent
twelve
truce
is
struck
and
in
mediation
of
the
peace
teucrians
and
latins
stray
mingling
unharmed
on
the
forest
heights
the
tall
ash
echoes
to
the
axe
strokes
they
overturn
pines
that
soar
into
the
sky
and
busily
cleave
oaken
logs
and
scented
cedar
with
wedges
and
drag
on
their
groaning
waggons
and
now
flying
rumour
harbinger
of
the
heavy
woe
fills
evander
and
evander
house
and
city
with
the
same
voice
that
but
now
told
of
pallas
victorious
over
latium
the
arcadians
stream
to
the
gates
snatching
funeral
torches
after
their
ancient
use
the
road
gleams
with
the
long
line
of
flame
and
parts
the
fields
with
a
broad
pathway
of
light
the
arriving
crowd
of
phrygians
meets
them
and
mingles
in
mourning
array
when
the
matrons
saw
all
the
train
approach
their
dwellings
they
kindle
the
town
with
loud
wailing
but
no
force
may
withhold
evander
he
comes
amid
them
the
bier
is
set
down
he
flings
himself
on
pallas
and
clasps
him
with
tears
and
sighs
and
scarcely
at
last
does
grief
leave
his
voice
utterance
free
than
this
o
pallas
was
thy
promise
to
thy
father
that
thou
wouldst
not
plunge
recklessly
into
the
fury
of
battle
i
knew
well
how
strong
was
the
fresh
pride
of
arms
and
the
sweetness
of
honour
in
a
first
battle
ah
unhappy
of
his
youth
and
bitter
prelude
of
the
war
upon
our
borders
ah
vows
and
prayers
of
mine
that
no
god
heard
and
thou
pure
crown
of
wifehood
happy
that
thou
art
dead
and
not
spared
for
this
sorrow
but
i
have
outgone
my
destiny
in
living
to
stay
here
the
survivor
of
my
child
would
i
had
followed
the
allied
arms
of
troy
to
be
overwhelmed
by
rutulian
weapons
would
my
life
had
been
given
and
i
and
not
my
pallas
were
borne
home
in
this
procession
i
would
not
blame
you
o
teucrians
nor
our
treaty
and
the
friendly
hands
we
clasped
our
old
age
had
that
appointed
debt
to
pay
yet
if
untimely
death
awaited
my
son
it
will
be
good
to
think
he
fell
leading
the
teucrians
into
latium
and
slew
his
volscian
thousands
before
he
fell
nay
no
other
funeral
than
this
would
i
deem
thy
due
my
pallas
than
good
aeneas
does
than
the
mighty
phrygians
than
the
tyrrhene
captains
and
all
the
army
of
tyrrhenia
great
are
the
trophies
they
bring
on
whom
thine
hand
deals
death
thou
also
turnus
wert
standing
now
a
great
trunk
dressed
in
arms
had
his
age
and
his
strength
of
years
equalled
thine
but
why
unhappy
do
i
delay
the
trojan
arms
go
and
forget
not
to
carry
this
message
to
your
king
thine
hand
it
is
that
keeps
me
lingering
in
a
life
that
is
hateful
since
pallas
fell
and
turnus
is
the
debt
thou
seest
son
and
father
claim
for
thy
virtue
and
thy
fortune
this
scope
alone
is
left
i
ask
not
joy
in
life
i
may
not
but
to
carry
this
to
my
son
deep
in
the
under
world
meanwhile
dawn
had
raised
her
gracious
light
on
weary
men
bringing
back
task
and
toil
now
lord
aeneas
how
tarchon
have
built
the
pyres
on
the
winding
shore
hither
in

fashion
hath
each
borne
the
bodies
of
his

the
dark
fire
is
lit
beneath
and
the
vapour
hides
high
heaven
in
gloom
thrice
girt
in
glittering
arms
they
have
marched
about
the
blazing
piles
thrice
compassed
on

the

fire
of
death
and
uttered
their
wail

fall
fast
upon

oxen
many
in
number
and
bristly
swine
and
cattle
gathered
out
of
all
the
country
are
slaughtered
over
the
flames
then
crowding
the
shore
they
gaze
on
their
burning
comrades
and
guard
the
embers
of
the
pyres
and
can
not
tear
themselves
away
till
dewy
night
wheels
on
the
glittering
sky
therewithal
the
unhappy
latins
far
apart
build
countless
pyres
and
bury
many
bodies
of
men
in
the
ground
and
many
more
they
lift
and
bear
away
to
the
neighbouring
country
or
send
them
back
to
the

the
rest
a
vast
heap
of
undistinguishable
slaughter
they
burn
uncounted
and
unhonoured
on

rivalry
of
fires
the
third
dawn

rolled
away
the

shadow
from

mournfully
they
piled
high
the
ashes
and
mingled

from

embers
and
heaped
a
load
of
warm
earth
above
them
now
in
the

here

and
their

unhappy

here
beloved

curse
the
disastrous
war
and

bridal
and
bid
him
his

decide
the

fiercely
embitters
their

therewith

a

the

him
and

people
and
fill
the
cliffs
with
their
melancholy
cries
this
it
was
i
had
to
look
for
even
from
the
time
when
i
madly
assailed
celestial
limbs
with
steel
and
sullied
the
hand
of
venus
with
a
wound
do
not
ah
do
not
urge
me
to
such
battles
neither
have
i
any
war
with
troy
since
her
towers
are
overthrown
nor
do
i
remember
with
delight
the
woes
of
old
turn
to
aeneas
with
the
gifts
you
bear
to
me
from
your
ancestral
borders
we
have
stood
to
face
his
grim
weapons
and
met
him
hand
to
hand
believe
one
who
hath
proved
it
how
mightily
he
rises
over
his
shield
in
what
a
whirlwind
he
hurls
his
spear
had
the
land
of
ida
borne
two
more
like
him
dardanus
had
marched
to
attack
the
towns
of
inachus
and
greece
were
mourning
fate
reverse
in
all
our
delay
before
that
obstinate
trojan
city
it
was
hector
and
aeneas
whose
hand
stayed
the
grecian
victory
and
bore
back
its
advance
to
the
tenth
year
both
were
splendid
in
courage
both
eminent
in
arms
aeneas
was
first
in
duty
let
your
hands
join
in
treaty
as
they
may
but
beware
that
your
weapons
close
not
with
his
hast
heard
most
gracious
king
at
once
what
is
the
king
answer
and
what
his
counsel
for
our
great
struggle
scarcely
thus
the
envoys
when
a
diverse
murmur
ran
through
the
troubled
lips
of
the
ausonians
even
as
when
rocks
delay
some
running
river
it
plashes
in
the
barred
pool
and
the
banks
murmur
nigh
to
the
babbling
wave
so
soon
as
their
minds
were
quieted
and
their
hurrying
lips
hushed
the
king
first
calling
on
the
gods
begins
from
his
lofty
throne
now
could
i
wish
o
latins
we
had
determined
our
course
of
state
and
it
had
been
better
thus
not
to
meet
in
council
at
such
a
time
as
now
with
the
enemy
seated
before
our
walls
we
wage
an
war
with
a
divine
race
invincible
unbroken
in
battle
who
brook
not
even
when
conquered
to
drop
the
sword
if
you
had
hope
in
appeal
to
aetolian
arms
abandon
it
though
each
man
hope
is
his
own
you
discern
how
narrow
a
path
it
is
beyond
that
you
see
with
your
eyes
and
handle
with
your
hands
the
total
ruin
of
our
fortunes
i
blame
no
one
what
valour
utmost
could
do
is
done
we
have
fought
with
our
whole
kingdom
strength
now
i
will
unfold
what
i
doubtfully
advise
and
purpose
and
with
your
attention
instruct
you
of
it
in
brief
there
is
an
ancient
land
of
mine
bordering
the
tuscan
river
stretching
far
westward
beyond
the
sicanian
borders
auruncans
and
rutulians
sow
on
it
work
the
stiff
hills
with
the
ploughshare
and
pasture
them
where
they
are
roughest
let
all
this
tract
with
a
belt
of
mountain
height
pass
to
the
teucrians
in
friendship
let
us
name
fair
terms
of
treaty
and
invite
them
as
allies
to
our
realm
let
them
settle
if
they
desire
it
so
and
found
a
city
but
if
they
have
a
mind
to
try
other
coasts
and
another
people
and
can
abide
to
leave
our
soil
let
us
build
twice
ten
ships
of
italian
oak
or
as
many
more
as
they
can
man
timber
lies
at
the
water
edge
for
all
let
them
assign
the
number
and
fashion
of
the
vessels
and
we
will
supply
brass
labour
dockyards
further
it
is
our
will
that
an
hundred
ambassadors
of
the
highest
rank
in
latium
shall
go
to
bear
our
words
and
ratify
the
treaty
holding
forth
in
their
hands
the
boughs
of
peace
and
carrying
for
gifts
weight
of
gold
and
ivory
and
the
chair
and
striped
robe
our
royal
array
give
counsel
openly
and
succour
our
exhausted
state
then
drances
again
he
whose
jealous
was
wrought
to
anger
and
stung
with
bitterness
by
turnus
fame
lavish
of
wealth
and
quick
of
tongue
though
his
hand
was
cold
in
war
held
no
empty
counsellor
and
potent
in
faction
his
mother
rank
ennobled
a
lineage
whose
paternal
source
was
obscure
rises
and
with
these
words
heaps
and
heightens
their
passion
to
no
man
and
needing
no
voice
of
ours
o
gracious
king
is
that
whereon
thou
takest
counsel
all
confess
they
know
how
our
fortune
sways
but
their
words
are
choked
let
him
grant
freedom
of
speech
and
abate
his
breath
he
by
whose
disastrous
government
and
perverse
way
i
will
speak
out
though
he
menace
me
with
arms
and
death
we
see
so
many
stars
of
battle
gone
down
and
all
our
city
sunk
in
mourning
while
he
confident
in
flight
assails
the
trojan
camp
and
makes
heaven
quail
before
his
arms
add
yet
one
to
those
gifts
of
thine
to
all
the
riches
thou
bidst
us
send
or
promise
to
the
dardanians
most
gracious
of
kings
but
one
let
no
man
passion
overbear
thee
from
giving
thine
own
daughter
to
an
illustrious
son
and
a
worthy
marriage
and
binding
this
peace
by
perpetual
treaty
yet
if
we
are
thus
heart
and
soul
let
us
implore
him
in
person
in
person
plead
him
of
his
grace
to
give
way
to
restore
king
and
country
their
proper
right
why
again
and
again
hurlest
thou
these
unhappy
citizens
on
peril
so
evident
o
source
and
spring
of
latium
woes
in
war
is
no
safety
peace
we
all
implore
of
thee
o
turnus
and
the
one
pledge
that
makes
peace
inviolable
i
the
first
i
whom
thou
picturest
thine
enemy
as
i
care
not
if
i
am
see
i
bow
at
thy
feet
pity
thine
allies
relent
and
retire
before
thy
conqueror
enough
have
we
seen
of
rout
and
death
and
desolation
over
our
broad
lands
or
if
glory
stir
thee
if
such
strength
kindle
in
thy
breast
and
if
a
palace
so
delight
thee
for
thy
dower
be
bold
and
advance
upon
the
foe
we
verily
that
turnus
may
have
his
royal
bride
must
lie
scattered
on
the
plains
worthless
lives
a
crowd
unburied
and
unwept
do
thou
also
if
thou
hast
aught
of
might
if
the
be
in
thee
as
in
thy
fathers
look
him
in
the
face
who
challenges
at
these
words
turnus
passion
blazed
out
he
utters
a
groan
and
breaks
forth
thus
in
deep
accents
indeed
drances
and
fluent
is
ever
thy
speech
at
the
moment
war
calls
for
action
and
when
the
fathers
are
summoned
thou
art
there
the
first
but
we
need
no
words
to
fill
our
safely
as
thou
wingest
them
while
the
mounded
walls
keep
off
the
enemy
and
the
trenches
swim
not
yet
with
blood
thunder
on
in
rhetoric
thy
wonted
way
accuse
thou
me
of
fear
drances
since
thine
hand
hath
heaped
so
many
teucrians
in
slaughter
and
thy
glorious
trophies
dot
the
fields
trial
is
open
of
what
live
valour
can
do
nor
indeed
is
our
foe
far
to
seek
on
all
sides
they
surround
our
walls
are
we
going
to
meet
them
why
linger
will
thy
bravery
ever
be
in
that
windy
tongue
and
those
timorous
feet
of
thine
conqueror
shall
any
justly
flout
me
as
conquered
who
sees
tiber
swoln
fuller
with
ilian
blood
and
all
the
house
and
people
of
evander
laid
low
and
the

of
their
armour
not
such

pandarus

me
and
the
thousand
men

on

day
my
conquering
hand
sent
down
to
hell
shut
as
i
was
in
their

and
closed
in

is
no

boding
on
the
dardanian
head
and
thine
own
fortunes
go
on
cease
not
to
throw
all
into
confusion
with
thy
terrors
to
exalt
the
strength
of
a
twice
vanquished
race
and
abase
the
arms
of
latinus
before
it
now
the
princes
of
the
myrmidons
tremble
before
phrygian
arms
now
tydeus
son

from
the
adriatic

or
when
the
scheming
villain
pretends
to
shrink
at
my
abuse
and
sharpens
calumny
by
terror
never
shall
this
hand
keep
quiet
rob
thee
of
such
a
soul
with
thee
let
it
abide
and
dwell
in
that
breast
of
thine
now
i
return
to
thee
my
lord
and
thy
weighty
resolves
if
thou
dost
repose
no
further
hope
in
our
arms
if
all
hath
indeed
left
us
and
one

been
our
utter
ruin
and
our
fortune
is
beyond
recovery
let
us
plead
for
peace
and
stretch
forth
unarmed
hands
yet
ah
had
we
aught
of
our
wonted
manhood
his
toil
beyond
all
other
is
blessed
and
his
spirit
eminent
who
rather
than
see
it
thus
hath
fallen
prone
in
death
and
once
bitten
the
ground
but
if
we
have
yet
resources
and
an
army
still
unbroken
and
cities
and
peoples
of
italy
remain
for
our
aid
but
if
even
the
trojans
have
won
their
glory
at
great
cost
of
blood
they
too
have
their
deaths
and
the
storm
fell
equally
on
all
why
do
we
shamefully
faint
even
on
the
threshold
why
does
a
shudder
seize
our
limbs
before
the
trumpet
sound
often
do

the

infant
holds
him
back
in
alarm
for
so
dear
a
burden
inly
revolving
all
he
settled
reluctantly
on
a
sudden
resolve
the
great
spear
that
the
warrior
haply
carried
in
his
stout
hand
of
and
seasoned
oak
to
it
he
ties
his
daughter
swathed
in
bark
of
the
woodland
and
binds
her
balanced
round
the
middle
of
the
spear
poising
it
in
his
great
right
hand
he
thus
cries
aloft
gracious
one
haunter
of
the
woodland
maiden
daughter
of
latona
a
father
devotes
this
babe
to
thy
service
thine
is
this
weapon
she
holds
thine
infant
suppliant
flying
through
the
air
from
her
enemies
accept
her
i
implore
o
goddess
for
thine
own
whom
now
i
entrust
to
the
chance
of
air
he
spoke
and
drawing
back
his
arm
darts
the
spinning
the
waters
roar
over
the
racing
river
poor
camilla
shoots
on
the
whistling
weapon
but
metabus
as
a
strong
band
now
presses
nigher
plunges
into
the
river
and
triumphantly
pulls
spear
and
girl
his
gift
to
trivia
from
the
grassy
turf
no
cities
ever
received
him
within
house
or
rampart
nor
had
his
savagery
submitted
to
it
he
led
his
life
on
the
lonely
pastoral
hills
here
he
nursed
his
daughter
in
the
underwood
among
tangled
coverts
on
the
milk
of
a
wild
teats
squeezing
the
udder
into
her
tender
lips
and
so
soon
as
the
baby
stood
and
went
straight
on
her
feet
he
armed
her
hands
with
a
sharp
javelin
and
hung
quiver
and
bow
from
her
little
shoulders
instead
of
gold
to
clasp
her
tresses
instead
of
the
long
skirted
gown
a
tiger
spoils
hang
down
her
back
even
then
her
tender
hand
hurled
childish
darts
and
whirled
about
her
head
the
twisted
thong
of
her
sling
and
struck
down
the
crane
from
strymon
or
the
swan
many
a
mother
among
tyrrhenian
towns
destined
her
for
their
sons
in
vain
content
with
diana
alone
she
keeps
unsoiled
for
ever
the
love
of
her
darts
and
maidenhood
would
she
had
not
plunged
thus
into
warfare
and
provoked
the
trojans
by
attack
so
were
she
now
dear
to
me
and
one
of
my
company
but
since
bitter
doom
is
upon
her
up
glide
from
heaven
o
nymph
and
seek
the
latin
borders
where
under
evil
omen
they
join
in
baleful
battle
take
these
and
draw
from
the
quiver
an
avenging
shaft
by
it
shall
he
pay
me
forfeit
of
his
blood
whoso
trojan
or
italian
alike
shall
sully
her
sacred
body
with
a
wound
thereafter
will
i
in
a
sheltering
cloud
bear
body
and
armour
of
the
hapless
girl
unspoiled
to
the
tomb
and
lay
them
in
her
native
land
she
spoke
but
the
other
sped
lightly
down
the
aery
sky
girt
about
with
dark
whirlwind
on
her
echoing
way
but
meanwhile
the
trojan
force
nears
the
walls
with
the
etruscan
captains
and
their
whole
cavalry
arrayed
in
ordered
squadrons
their
horses
trampling
hoofs
thunder
on
all
the
field
as
swerving
this
way
and
that
they
chafe
at
the
reins
pressure
the
iron
field
bristles
wide
with
spears
and
the
plain
is
aflame
with
uplifted
arms
likewise
messapus
and
the
latin
horse
and
coras
and
his
brother
and
maiden
camilla
squadron
come
forth
against
them
on
the
plain
and
draw
back
their
hands
and
level
the
flickering
points
of
their
long
lances
in
a
fire
of
neighing
horses
and
advancing
men
and
now
each
had
drawn
within
of
each
and
drew
up
with
a
sudden
shout
they
dart
forth
and
urge
on
their
furious
horses
from
all
sides
at
once
weapons
shower
thick
like
snow
and
veil
the
sky
with
their
shadow
in
a
moment
tyrrhenus
and
fiery
aconteus
charge
violently
with
crossing
spears
and
are
the
first
to
fall
they
go
down
with
a
heavy
crash
and
their
beasts
break
and
shatter
chest
upon
chest
aconteus
hurled
off
like
a
thunderbolt
or
some
mass
slung
from
an
engine
is
dashed
away
and
scatters
his
life
in
air
immediately
the
lines
waver
and
the
latins
wheeling
about
throw
their
shields
behind
them
and
turn
their
horses
towards
the
town
the
trojans
pursue
asilas
heads
and
leads
on
their
squadrons
and
now
they
drew
nigh
the
gates
and
again
the
latins
raise
a
shout
and
wheel
their
supple
necks
about
the
pursuers
fly
and
gallop
right
back
with
loosened
rein
as
when
the
sea
running
up
in
ebb
and
flow
now
rushes
shoreward
and
strikes
over
the
cliffs
in
a
wave
of
foam
drenching
the
edge
of
the
sand
in
its
curving
sweep
now
runs
swirling
back
and
the
surge
sucks
the
rolling
stones
away
twice
the
tuscans
turn
and
drive
the
rutulians
towards
the
town
twice
they
are
repelled
and
look
back
behind
them
from
cover
of
their
shields
but
when
now
meeting
in
a
third
encounter
the
lines
are
locked
together
all
their
length
and
man
singles
out
his
man
then
indeed
amid
groans
of
the
dying
deep
in
blood
roll
armour
and
bodies
and
horses
half
slain
mixed
up
with
slaughtered
men
the
battle
swells
fierce
orsilochus
hurled
his
spear
at
the
horse
of
remulus
whom
himself
he
shrank
to
meet
and
left
the
steel
in
it
under
the
ear
at
the
stroke
the
charger
rears
madly
and
mastered
by
the
wound
lifts
his
chest
and
flings
up
his
legs
the
rider
is
thrown
and
rolls
over
on
the
ground
catillus
strikes
down
iollas
and
herminius
mighty
in
courage
mighty
in
limbs
and
arms
bareheaded
undismayed
by
wounds
he
leaves
his
vast
body
open
against
arms
through
his
broad
shoulders
the
quivering
spear
runs
piercing
him
through
and
doubles
him
up
with
pain
everywhere
the
dark
blood
flows
they
deal
death
with
the
sword
in
battle
and
seek
a
noble
death
by
wounds
but
amid
the
slaughter
camilla
rages
a
quivered
amazon
with
one
side
stripped
for
battle
and
now
sends
tough
javelins
showering
from
her
hand
now
snatches
the
strong
in
her
unwearying
grasp
the
golden
bow
the
armour
of
diana
clashes
on
her
shoulders
and
even
when
forced
backward
in
retreat
she
turns
in
flight
and
aims
darts
from
her
bow
but
around
her
are
her
chosen
comrades
maiden

tulla
tarpeia
brandishing
an
axe
inlaid
with
bronze
girls
of
italy
whom
camilla
the
bright
chose
for
her

escort
good
at
service
in
peace
and
war
even
as
thracian
amazons
when
the
streams
of
thermodon
clash
beneath
them
as
they
go
to
war
in
painted
arms
whether
around
hippolyte
or
while
martial
penthesilea
returns
in
her
chariot
and
the
columns
of
women
dance
with
loud
confused
cry
whom
first
whom
last
fierce
maiden
does
thy
dart
strike
down
first
euneus
son
of
clytius
for
as
he
meets
her
the
long
fir
shaft
crashes
through
his
open
breast
he
falls
spouting
streams
of
blood
and
bites
the
gory
ground
and
dying
writhes
himself
upon
his
wound
then
liris
and
pagasus
above
him
who
fall
headlong
and
together
the
one
thrown
as
he
reins
up
his
horse
stabbed
under
him
the
other
while
he
runs
forward
and
stretches
his
unarmed
hand
to
stay
his
fall
to
these
she
joins
amastrus
son
of
hippotas
and
follows
from
far
with
her
spear
tereus
and
harpalycus
and
demophoön
and
chromis
and
as
many
darts
as
the
maiden
sends
whirling
from
her
hand
so
many
phrygians
fall
ornytus
the
hunter
rides
near
in
strange
arms
on
his
iapygian
horse
his
broad
warrior
shoulders
swathed
in
the
hide
stripped
from
a
bullock
his
head
covered
by
a
wolf
mouth
and
jaws
a
rustic
pike
arms
his
hand
himself
he
moves
amid
the
squadrons
a
full
head
over
all
catching
him
up
for
that
was
easy
amid
the
rout
she
runs
him
through
and
thus
cries
above
her
enemy
wert
hunting
wild
beasts
in
the
forest
thoughtest
thou
tyrrhenian
the
day
is
come
for
a
woman
arms
to
refute
thy
words
yet
no
light
fame
shalt
thou
carry
to
thy
fathers
ghosts
to
have
fallen
under
the
weapon
of
camilla
next
orsilochus
and
butes
the
two
mightiest
of
mould
among
the
teucrians
butes
she
pierces
in
the
back
with
her
between
corslet
and
helmet
where
the
neck
shews
as
he
sits
and
the
shield
hangs
from
his
left
shoulder
orsilochus
she
flies
and
darting
in
a
wide
circle
slips
into
the
inner
ring
and
pursues
her
pursuer
then
rising
her
full
height
she
drives
the
strong
axe
deep
through
armour
and
bone
as
he
pleads
and
makes
much
entreaty
warm
brain
from
the
wound
splashes
his
face
one
met
her
thus
and
hung
startled
by
the
sudden
sight
the
warrior
son
of
aunus
haunter
of
the
apennine
not
the
meanest
in
liguria
while
fate
allowed
him
to
deceive
and
he
when
he
discerns
that
no
fleetness
of
foot
may
now
save
him
from
battle
or
turn
the
princess
from
pursuit
essays
to
wind
a
subtle
device
of
treachery
and
thus
begins
hast
thou
glory
if
a
woman
trust
in
her
horse
strength
debar
retreat
trust
thyself
to
level
ground
at
close
quarters
with
me
and
prepare
to
fight
on
foot
soon
wilt
thou
know
how
windy
boasting
brings
one
to
harm
he
spoke
but
she
furious
and
stung
with
fiery
indignation
hands
her
horse
to
an
attendant
and
takes
her
stand
in
equal
arms
on
foot
and
undismayed
with
naked
sword
and
shield
unemblazoned
but
he
thinking
his
craft
had
won
the
day
himself
flies
off
on
the
instant
and
turning
his
rein
darts
off
in
flight
pricking
his
beast
to
speed
with
heel
ligurian
in
vain
elated
in
thy
pride
for
naught
hast
thou
attempted
thy
slippery
native
arts
nor
will
thy
craft
bring
thee
home
unhurt
to
treacherous
aunus
so
speaks
the
maiden
and
with
running
feet
swift
as
fire
crosses
his
horse
and
catching
the
bridle
meets
him
in
front
and
takes
her
vengeance
in
her
enemy
blood
as
lightly
as
the
falcon
bird
of
bale
swoops
down
from
aloft
on
a
pigeon
high
in
a
cloud
and
pounces
on
and
holds
her
and
disembowels
her
with
taloned
feet
while
blood
and
torn
feathers
flutter
down
the
sky
but
the
creator
of
men
and
gods
sits
high
on
olympus
summit
watching
this
not
with
eyes
unseeing
he
kindles
tyrrhenian
tarchon
to
the
fierce
battle
and
sharply
goads
him
on
to
wrath
so
tarchon
gallops
amid
the
slaughter
where
his
squadrons
retreat
and
urges
his
troops
in
changing
tones
calling
man
on
man
by
name
and
rallies
the
fliers
to
fight
terror
what
utter
cowardice
hath
fallen
on
your
spirits
o
never
to
be
stung
to
shame
o
slack
alway
a
woman
drives
you
in
disorder
and
routs
our
ranks
why
wear
we
steel
for
what
are
these
idle
weapons
in
our
hands
yet
not
slack
in
venus
service
and
wars
by
night
or
when
the
curving
flute
proclaims
bacchus
revels
to
look
forward
to
the
feast
and
the
cups
on
the
loaded
board
this
your
passion
this
your
desire
till
the
soothsayer
pronounce
the
offering
favourable
and
the
fatted
victim
invite
you
to
the
deep
groves
so
speaking
he
spurs
his
horse
into
the
midmost
ready
himself
to
die
and
bears
violently
down
full
on
venulus
and
tearing
him
from
horseback
grasps
his
enemy
and
carries
him
away
with
him
on
the
by
main
force
a
cry
rises
up
and
all
the
latins
turn
their
eyes
tarchon
flies
like
fire
over
the
plain
carrying
the
armed
man
and
breaks
off
the
steel
head
from
his
own
spear
and
searches
the
uncovered
places
trying
where
he
may
deal
the
mortal
blow
the
other
struggling
against
him
keeps
his
hand
off
his
throat
and
strongly
parries
his
attack
and
as
when
a
golden
eagle
snatches
and
soars
with
a
serpent
in
his
clutch
and
his
feet
are
fast
in
it
and
his
talons
cling
but
the
wounded
snake
writhes
in
coiling
spires
and
its
scales
rise
and
roughen
and
its
mouth
hisses
as
it
towers
upward
the
bird
none
the
less
attacks
his
struggling
prize
with
crooked
beak
while
his
vans
beat
the
air
even
so
tarchon
carries
tiburtus
out
of
the
ranks
triumphant
in
his
prize
following
their
captain
example
and
issue
the
men
of
maeonia
charge
in
then
arruns
due
to
his
doom
circles
in
advance
of
fleet
camilla
with
artful
javelin
and
tries
how
fortune
may
be
easiest
where
the
maiden
darts
furious
amid
the
ranks
there
arruns
slips
up
and
silently
tracks
her
footsteps
where
she
returns
victorious
and
retires
from
amid
the
enemy
there
he
stealthily
bends
his
rapid
reins
here
he
approaches
and
here
again
he
approaches
and
strays
all
round
and
about
and
untiringly
shakes
his
certain
spear
haply
chloreus
sacred
to
cybele
and
once
her
priest
glittered
afar
splendid
in
phrygian
armour
a
skin
feathered
with
brazen
scales
and
clasped
with
gold
clothed
the
horse
that
foamed
under
his
spur
himself
he
shone
in
foreign
blue
and
scarlet
with
fleet
gortynian
shafts
and
a
lycian
horn
a
golden
bow
was
on
his
shoulder
and
the
soothsayer
helmet
was
of
gold
red
gold
knotted
up
his
yellow
scarf
with
its
rustling
lawny
folds
his
tunics
and
barbarian
trousers
were
wrought
in
needlework
him
whether
that
she
might
nail
armour
of
troy
on
her
temples
or
herself
move
in
captive
gold
the
maiden
pursued
in
blind
chase
alone
of
all
the
battle
conflict
and
down
the
whole
line
reckless
and
fired
by
a
passion
for
spoils
and
plunder
when
at
last
out
of
his
ambush
arruns
chooses
his
time
and
darts
his
javelin
praying
thus
aloud
to
heaven

high

phoebus

half
his
vow
to
prosper
half
he

into
the
flying

to

and
strike
down
camilla
in
sudden
death
this
he
yielded
to
his
prayer
that
his
high
home
might
see
his
return
he
gave
not
and
a
gust
swept
off
his
accents
on
the
gale
so
when
the
spear
sped
from
his
hand
hurtled
through
the
air
all
the
volscians
marked
it
well
and
turned
their
eyes
on
the
queen
and
she
alone
knew
not
wind
or
sound
of
the
weapon
on
its
aery
path

the
spear
passed
home
and
sank

met
it

arruns
takes
to

more
alarmed
than
all
in
mingled
fear
and
exultation
and
no
longer
dares
to
trust
his
spear
or

and
as
the
wolf
some
shepherd
or
great
bullock
slain
plunges
at
once
among
the
trackless
mountain
heights
ere
hostile
darts
are
in
pursuit
and
knows
how
reckless
he
hath
been
and
drooping
his
tail
lays
it
quivering
under
his
belly
and
seeks
the
woods
even
so
does
arruns
withdraw
from
sight
in
dismay
and
satisfied
to
escape
mingles
in
the
throng
of
arms
the
dying
woman
pulls
at
the

with

the
iron

fixed
deep
in

chilling
in

the

her

sank
overpowered
by
death
and
her

fell

with

the

fled

rises

she
espied

she
sighed
and
uttered
forth
a

cry

cruel
o

the
forfeit
thou
hast
paid
for

on

these

uttered
withdrawing
swiftly
homeward
he
orders
out
his

and
rejoicingly
beholds
them
snorting
before
his

those
that

gave
to

pilumnus
such
as
would
excel
the

in

the
eager
charioteers
stand
round

pat
their
chests
with
clapping
hollowed
hands
and
comb

next
he
girds
on
his
shoulders
the
corslet
stiff
with
gold
and
pale
and
buckles
on
the
sword
and

and
that
sword
the
divine
lord
of
fire
had
himself
forged
for
his

daunus
and
dipped
glowing
in
the
stygian
wave
next
where
it
stood
amid
his
dwelling
leaning
on
a
massy
pillar
he
strongly
seizes
his
stout
spear
the
spoil
of
actor
the

and
brandishes
it
quivering
and
cries
aloud
o

never

to
rend
and
shatter
the
corslet
and
defile
in

the
locks
curled
with
hot
iron
and
wet
with
myrrh
thus
madly
he
runs
on
sparkles
leap
out
from
all
his
blazing
face
and
his
keen
eyes
flash
fire
even
as
the
bull
when
before

he
bellows
awfully
and
drives
against

or
scatters

as
this

haply
he
bore
a
sceptre
in
his
hand
never
burgeon
into
thin
leafage
and
shady
shoot
since
once
in
the
forest
cut
down
right
to
the
stem
it
lost
its
mother
and
the
steel
lopped
away
its
tressed
arms
a
tree
of
old
now
the
hand
hath
bound
it
in
adornment
of
brass
and
given
it
to
our
latin
fathers
bearing
with
such
words
they
sealed
mutual
treaty
midway
in
sight
of
the
princes
then
they
duly
slay
the
consecrated
beasts
over
the
flames
and
tear
out
their
live
entrails
and
pile
the
altars
with
laden
chargers
but
long
ere
this
the
rutulians
deemed
the
battle
unequal
and
their
hearts
are
stirred
in
changeful
motion
and
now
the
more
as
they
discern
nigher
that
in
strength
heightened
by
turnus
as
advancing
with
noiseless
pace
he
humbly
worships
at
the
altar
with
downcast
eye
by
his
wasted
cheeks
and
the
pallor
on
his
youthful
frame
soon
as
juturna
his
sister
saw
this
talk
spread
and
the
mind
waver
in
uncertainty
into
the
mid
ranks
in
feigned
form
of
camertus
his
family
was
high
in
long
ancestry
and
his
father
name
for
valour
renowned
and
himself
most
valiant
in
arms
into
the
mid
ranks
she
glides
not
ignorant
of
her
task
and
scatters
diverse
rumours
saying
thus
o
rutulians
shall
we
set
one
life
in
the
breach
for
so
many
such
as
these
are
we
unequal
in
numbers
or
bravery
see
troy
and
arcadia
is
all
they
bring
and
those
bands
that
etruria
hurls
on
turnus
scarce
is
there
an
enemy
to
meet
every
other
man
of
ours
he
indeed
will
ascend
to
the
gods
for
whose
altars
he
devotes
himself
and
move
living
in
the
lips
of
men
we
our
country
lost
shall
bow
to
the
haughty
rigour
of
our
lords
if
we
now
sit
slackly
on
the
field
by
such
words
the
soldiers
counsel
was
kindled
yet
higher
and
higher
and
a
murmur
crept
through
their
columns
the
very
laurentines
the
very
latins
are
changed
and
they
who
but
now
hoped
for
rest
from
battle
and
rescue
of
fortune
now
desire
arms
and
pray
the
treaty
were
undone
and
pity
turnus
cruel
lot
to
this
juturna
adds
a
yet
stronger
impulse
and
high
in
heaven
shews
a
sign
more
potent
than
any
to
confuse
italian
souls
with
delusive
augury
for
on
the
crimsoned
sky
jove
tawny
bird
flew
chasing
in
a
screaming
crowd
fowl
of
the
shore
that
winged
their
column
then
suddenly
stooping
to
the
water
pounces
on
a
noble
swan
with
merciless
crooked
talons
the
startled
italians
watch
while
all
the
birds
together
clamorously
wheel
round
from
flight
wonderful
to
see
and
dim
the
sky
with
their
pinions
and
in
thickening
cloud
urge
their
foe
through
air
till
conquered
by
their
attack
and
his
heavy
prey
he
yielded
and
dropped
it
from
his
talons
into
the
river
and
winged
his
way
deep
into
the
clouds
then
indeed
the
rutulians
clamorously
greet
the
omen
and
their
hands
flash
out
and
tolumnius
the
augur
cries
before
them
all
it
was
this
that
my

often
have
sought

up

o
hapless
people
whom
the
greedy
alien
frightens
with
his
arms
like
silly
birds
and
with
strong
hand
ravages
your
shores
he
too
will
take
to
flight
and
spread
his
sails
afar
over
ocean

you
with
one
heart
close
up
your
squadrons
and
defend
in

your
lost
king

spoke

darting
forward
hurled
a
weapon
full
on
the
enemy
the
whistling
sings
and
unerringly
cleaves
the
air
at
once
and
with
it
a
vast
shout
goes
up
and
all
their
rows
are
amazed
and
their
hearts
hotly
stirred
the
spear
flies
on
where
haply
stood
opposite

ninefold

the

of

now
following

ran

before

juturna
heard

knew
the

and
in
terror
fled
away
he
flies
on

hurries
his

over

as

over

shudder
from

it
will
deal

to

and
make

path
of
ruin
the

fly
before
it

its

drives
his

full

reproaches

forced
into

that
twice
now
do
the

choose
warfare
and

discord
rises
among

some
bid
unbar
the

fling
wide
their

to
the
dardanians
and
pull
the

himself
towards
the
ramparts
others
bring
arms
and
hasten
to
defend
the

as
when
a
shepherd
tracks
bees
to
their
retreat
in
a
recessed
rock
and
fills
it
with
stinging
smoke
they
within
run
uneasily
up

down

fortress

hum
louder
in
rising
wrath
the
smell
rolls
in
darkness
along
their
dwelling

a
blind
murmur
echoes
within
the
rock
as
the
smoke
issues
to
the
empty

this
fortune
likewise
befell
the
despairing
latins
this
woe
shook

the

scaled
and

flying
on

nowhere
rutulian

none
of

them
alas
she
deems
him
destroyed
in
the
shock
of
battle
and
distracted
by
sudden
anguish
shrieks
that
she
is
the
source
of
guilt
the
spring
of
ill
and
with
many
a
mad
utterance
of
frenzied
grief
rends
her
purple
attire
with
dying
hand
and
ties
from
a
lofty
beam
the
ghastly
noose
of
death
and
when
the
unhappy
latin
women
knew
this
calamity
first
her
daughter
lavinia

her
tresses
and
roseate
cheeks
and
all
the
train
around

madden
in

the

palace
echoes
to
their
wailing
and
from
it
the
sorrowful
rumour
spreads
abroad
throughout
the
town
all
hearts
sink
latinus
goes
with
torn
raiment
in
dismay
at
his
wife
doom
and
his
city
downfall
defiling
his
hoary
hair
with
soilure
of
sprinkled
dust
meanwhile
on
the
skirts
of
the
field
turnus
chases
scattered
stragglers
ever
slacker
to
battle
ever
less
and
less
exultant
in
his
coursers
victorious
speed
the
confused
cry
came
to
him
borne
in
blind
terror
down
the
breeze
and
his
startled
ears
caught
the
echoing
tumult
and
disastrous
murmur
of
the
town
me
what
agony
shakes
the
city
or
what
is
this
cry
that
fleets
so
loud
from
the
distant
town
so
speaks
he
and
distractedly
checks
the
reins
and
to
him
his
sister
as
changed
into
his
charioteer
metiscus
likeness
she
swayed
horses
and
thus
rejoined

turnus
let
us
pursue
the
brood
of
troy
where
victory
opens
her
nearest
way
there
are
others
whose
hands
can
protect
their
dwellings
aeneas
falls
fiercer
on
the
italians
and
closes
in

let
our
hand
too
deal
pitiless
death
on
his
teucrians
neither
in
tale
of
dead
nor
in
glory
of

shalt
thou
retire
outdone
thereat
turnus
my
sister
long
ere
now
i
knew
thee
when
first
thine
arts
shattered
the
treaty
and
thou
didst
mingle
in
the
strife
and
now
thy
godhead
conceals
itself
in
vain
but
who
hath
bidden
thee
descend
from
heaven
to
bear
this
sore
travail
was
it
that
thou
mightest
see
thy
hapless
brother
cruelly
slain
for
what
do
i
or
what
fortune
yet
gives
promise
of
safety
before
my
very
eyes
calling
aloud
on
me
i
saw
murranus
than
whom
none
other
is
left
me
more
dear
sink
huge
to

borne
down
by
as
huge
a
wound
hapless
ufens
is
fallen
not
to
see
our
shame
corpse
and

are
in

the
destruction

this
was
the
one
thing
yet
lacking

i
suffer
it
shall
my

not
refute

jeers
shall
i
turn
my
back
and
this

see
turnus
a
fugitive
is
death
all
so
bitter
do
you
o
shades
be
gracious
to
me
since
the
powers
of

are
estranged
to
you
shall
i
go
down
a
pure
spirit
and
ignorant
of
your

never

unworthy

of

scarce

through
the

of

in
thee

thy

king

himself
mutters
in

moreover
the

fled

sustain

about

shivers
with

points
thou
wheelest
thy
chariot
on
the
sward
alone
at
the
distracting
picture
of
his
fortune
turnus
froze
in
horror
and
stood
in
dumb
gaze
together
in
his
heart
sweep
the
vast
mingling
tides
of
shame
and
maddened
grief
and
love
stung
to
frenzy
and
resolved
valour
so
soon
as
the
darkness
cleared
and
light
returned
to
his
soul
he
fiercely
turned
his
blazing
eyeballs
towards
the
ramparts
and
gazed
back
from
his
wheels
on
the
great
city
and
lo
a
spire
of
flame
wreathing
through
the
floors
wavered
up
skyward
and
held
a
turret
fast
a
turret
that
he
himself
had
reared
of
mortised
planks
and
set
on
rollers
and
laid
with
high
gangways
o
my
sister
now
fate
prevails
cease
to
hinder
let
us
follow
where
deity
and
stern
fortune
call
i
am
resolved
to
face
aeneas
resolved
to
bear
what
bitterness
there
is
in
death
nor
shalt
thou
longer
see
me
shamed
sister
of
mine
let
me
be
mad
i
pray
thee
with
this
madness
before
the
end
he
spoke
and
leapt
swiftly
from
his
chariot
to
the
field
and
darting
through
weapons
and
through
enemies
leaves
his
sorrowing
sister
and
bursts
in
rapid
course
amid
their
columns
and
as
when
a
rock
rushes
headlong
from
some
mountain
peak
torn
away
by
the
blast
or
if
the
rushing
rain
washes
it
away
or
the
stealing
years
loosen
its
ancient
hold
the
reckless
mountain
mass
goes
sheer
and
impetuous
and
leaps
along
the
ground
hurling
with
it
forests
and
herds
and
men
thus
through
the
scattering
columns
turnus
rushes
to
the
city
walls
where
the
earth
is
wettest
with
bloodshed
and
the
air
sings
with
spears
and
beckons
with
his
hand
and
thus
begins
aloud
now
o
rutulians
and
you
latins
stay
your
weapons
whatsoever
fortune
is
left
is
mine
i
singly
must
expiate
the
treaty
for
you
all
and
make
decision
with
the
sword
all
drew
aside
and
left
him
room
but
lord
aeneas
hearing
turnus
name
abandons
the
walls
abandons
the
fortress
height
and
in
exultant
joy
flings
aside
all
hindrance
breaks
off
all
work
and
clashes
his
armour
terribly
vast
as
athos
or
as
eryx
or
as
the
lord
of
apennine
when
he
roars
with
his
tossing
ilex
woods
and
rears
his
snowy
crest
rejoicing
into
air
now
indeed
rutulians
and
trojans
and
all
italy
turned
in
emulous
gaze
and
they
who
held
the
high
city
and
they
whose
ram
was
battering
the
foundations
of
the
wall
and
unarmed
their
shoulders
latinus
himself
stands
in
amaze
at
the
mighty
men
born
in

quarters
of

met
and
making
decision
with
the
sword
and
they
in
the
empty
level
field
that
cleared
for
them
darted
swiftly
forward
and
hurling

from

close
in

shock
with
clangour
of
brazen
shields
earth
utters
a
moan
the
fall
thick
and
fast
chance
and
valour
joining
in
one
and
as
in
broad
sila
or
high
on
taburnus
when
two
bulls
rush
to
deadly
battle
forehead
to
forehead
the
herdsmen
retire
in
terror
all
the
herd
stands
dumb
in
dismay
and
the
heifers
murmur
in
doubt
which
shall
be
lord
in
the
woodland
which
all
the
cattle
must
follow
they
violently
deal

together

the
mighty
crash
fills
the

jupiter
himself
holds
up
the
two
scales
in

lays
in

the
different
fates

sink
in

turnus
darts
out
thinking

rises
with
his

reach
of
body
on
his
uplifted
sword
then
strikes
trojans
and
latins
cry
out
in
excitement
and
both
armies
strain
their
gaze
but
the
treacherous
sword
shivers
and
in
mid
stroke
deserts
its
eager
lord
if
flight
aid
him
not
now
he
flies
swifter
than
the
wind
when
once
he
descries
a
strange
hilt
in
his
weaponless
hand
rumour
is
that
in
his
headlong
hurry
when
mounting
behind
his
yoked
horses
to
begin
the
battle
he
left
his
father
sword
behind
and
caught
up
his
charioteer
metiscus
weapon
and
that
served
him
long
while
teucrian
stragglers
turned
their
backs
when
it
met
the
divine
vulcanian
armour
the
mortal
blade
like
brittle
ice
snapped
in
the
stroke
the
shards
lie
glittering
upon
the
yellow
sand
so
in
distracted
flight
turnus
darts
afar
over
the
plain
and
now
this
way
and
now
that
crosses
in
wavering
circles
for
on
all
hands
the
teucrians
locked
him
in
crowded
ring
and
the
dreary
marsh
on
this
side
on
this
the
steep
city
ramparts
hem
him
in
therewith
aeneas
pursues
though
ever
and
anon
his
knees
disabled
by
the
arrow
hinder
and
stay
his
speed
and
foot
hard
on
foot
presses
hotly
on
his
hurrying
enemy
as
when
a
hunter
courses
with
a
fleet
barking
hound
some
stag
caught
in
a
or
girt
by
the
toils
and
he
in
terror
of
the
snares
and
the
high
darts
back
and
forward
in
a
thousand
ways
but
the
keen
umbrian
clings
agape
and
just
catches
at
him
and
as
though
he
caught
him
snaps
his
jaws
while
the
baffled
teeth
close
on
vacancy
then
indeed
a
cry
goes
up
and
banks
and
pools
answer
round
about
and
all
the
sky
echoes
the
din
he
even
as
he
flies
chides
all
his
rutulians
calling
each
by
name
and
shrieks
for
the
sword
he
knew
but
aeneas
denounces
death
and
instant
doom
if
one
of
them
draw
nigh
and
doubles
their
terror
with
threats
of
their
city
destruction
and
though
wounded
presses
on
five
circles
they
cover
at
full
speed
and
unwind
as
many
this
way
and
that
for
not
light
nor
slight
is
the
prize
they
seek
but
turnus
very
lifeblood
is
at
issue
here
there
haply
had
stood
a
wild
olive
sacred
to
faunus
a
tree
worshipped
by
mariners
of
old
on
it
when
rescued
from
the
waves
they
were
wont
to
fix
their
gifts
to
the
god
of
laurentum
and
hang
their
votive
raiment
but
the
teucrians
unregarding
had
cleared
away
the
sacred
stem
that
they
might
meet
on
unimpeded
lists
here
stood
aeneas
spear
hither
borne
by
its
own
speed
it
was
held
fast
stuck
in
the
tough
root
the
dardanian
stooped
over
it
and
would
wrench
away
the
steel
to
follow
with
the
weapon
him
whom
he
could
not
catch
in
running
then
indeed
turnus
cries
in
frantic
terror
have
pity
i
beseech
thee
and
thou
most
gracious
earth
keep
thy
hold
on
the
steel
as
i
ever
have
kept
your
worship
and
the
aeneadae
again
have
polluted
it
in
war
he
spoke
and
called
the
god
to
aid
in
vows
that
fell
not
fruitless
for
all
aeneas
strength
his
long
struggling
and
delay
over
the
tough
stem
availed
not
to
unclose
the
hard
grip
of
the
wood
while
he
strains
and
pulls
hard
the
daunian
goddess
changing
once
more
into
the
charioteer
metiscus
likeness
runs
forward
and
passes
her
brother
his
sword
but
venus
indignant
that
the
nymph
might
be
so
bold
drew
nigh
and
wrenched
away
the
spear
where
it
stuck
deep
in
the
root
erect
in
fresh
courage
and
arms
he
with
his
faithful
sword
he
towering
fierce
over
his
spear
they

one
another
panting
in
the

the

accosts

of

there
are
called

by

whom
with
infernal
megaera
the
dead
of
night
bore
at
one
single
birth
and
wreathed
them
in
like
serpent
coils
and
clothed
them
in
windy
wings

appear
at

in
the

the

the

deals
sicknesses

of

upon

cities
one
of

jupiter
sent
swiftly
down
from

and
bade
her
meet
juturna
for
a
sign
she
wings
her

in

sprung

to

the

of
night
when
she
espies
the
ilian
ranks
and
turnus
columns
suddenly
shrinking
to
the
shape
of
a
small
bird
that
often
sits
late
by
night
on
tombs
or
ruinous
roofs
and
vexes
the
darkness
with
her
cry
in
such
change
of
likeness
the
monster
shrilly
passes
and
repasses
before
turnus
face
and
her
wings
beat
restlessly
on
his
shield
a
strange
numbing
terror
unnerves
his
limbs
his
hair
thrills
up
and
the
accents
falter
on
his
tongue
but
when
his
hapless
sister
knew
afar
the
whistling
wings
of
the
fury
juturna
unbinds
and
tears
her
tresses
with
rent
face
and
smitten
bosom
o

can
thine

help
thee
now
or
what
more

there
if
i

what

is

for

what

why

now
assuredly
could

ah
how

so
spoke
she
and
wrapping

in

vesture
the

sank
in

his

a
stone

that
haply
lay
upon
the

for
a

to
divide
contested
fields
scarcely
might
twelve
chosen
men
lift
it
on
their
shoulders
of
such
frame
as
now
earth
brings
to

then
the
hero
caught
it
up
with
trembling
hand
and
whirled
it
at
the
foe
rising
higher
and
quickening
his
speed
but
he
knows
not
his

self
running
nor
going
nor
lifting
his
hands
or
moving
the
mighty
stone
his

totter
his

the
very

he
hurls
spinning
through
the
empty
void

reached
its

nor
carried
its
blow
home
and
as
in
sleep
when
nightly
rest
weighs
down
our
languorous
eyes
we
seem
vainly
to
will
to
run
eagerly
on
and
sink
faint
amidst
our
struggles
the
tongue
is
powerless
the
familiar
strength
fails
the
body
nor
will
words
or
utterance
follow
so
the
disastrous
goddess
brings
to
naught
all
turnus
valour
as
he
presses
on
his
heart
wavers
in
shifting
emotion
he
gazes
on
his
rutulians
and
on
the
city
and
falters
in
terror
and
shudders
at
the
imminent
spear
neither
sees
he
whither
he
may
escape
nor
how
rush
violently
on
the
enemy
and
nowhere
his
chariot
or
his
sister
at
the
reins
as
he
wavers
aeneas
poises
the
deadly
weapon
and
marking
his
chance
hurls
it
in
from

with
all
his
strength
of

never
with
such
a
roar
are
stones
hurled
from

the
thunder
burst
in
